"In the last video, I spoke
somewhat theoretically about",00:00:00.330,00:00:02.890
"what a null space is
and we showed that",00:00:02.890,00:00:04.690
it is a valid subspace.,00:00:04.690,00:00:06.700
"But in this video let's actually
calculate the null",00:00:06.700,00:00:08.960
space for a matrix.,00:00:08.960,00:00:10.380
"In this case, we'll calculate
the null space of matrix A.",00:00:10.380,00:00:14.220
"So null space is literally
just the set of all the",00:00:14.220,00:00:17.420
"vectors that, when I multiply A
times any of those vectors,",00:00:17.420,00:00:21.230
"so let me say that the vector
x1, x2, x3, x4 is a member of",00:00:21.230,00:00:29.560
our null space.,00:00:29.560,00:00:30.850
"So when I multiply this matrix
times this vector I should get",00:00:30.850,00:00:33.410
the 0 vector.,00:00:33.410,00:00:34.920
I should get the vector.,00:00:34.920,00:00:37.430
"And just to make a few
points here, this",00:00:37.430,00:00:39.450
has exactly 4 columns.,00:00:39.450,00:00:40.850
"This is a 3 by 4 matrix, so I've
only legitimately defined",00:00:40.850,00:00:47.120
"multiplication of this times a
four-component vector or a",00:00:47.120,00:00:51.310
member of Rn.,00:00:51.310,00:00:53.050
Let me call this X.,00:00:53.050,00:00:54.970
And this is our vector X.,00:00:54.970,00:00:56.440
This is a member of R4.,00:00:56.440,00:00:59.700
It has four components.,00:00:59.700,00:01:01.260
"And then when you multiply
these, we need",00:01:01.260,00:01:03.040
to produce a 0 vector.,00:01:03.040,00:01:04.480
"The null space is the set of
all the vectors, and when I",00:01:04.480,00:01:07.090
"multiply it times A, I
produce the 0 vector.",00:01:07.090,00:01:09.350
And what am I going to get?,00:01:09.350,00:01:10.060
"I'm going to have one row times
this and that's going to",00:01:10.060,00:01:12.570
"be the first entry, then this
row times, that's the second",00:01:12.570,00:01:14.830
"entry, and then the third row.",00:01:14.830,00:01:15.780
"So I should have three 0's So my
0 vector is going to be the",00:01:15.780,00:01:21.580
0 vector in R3.,00:01:21.580,00:01:24.070
"So how do we figure out the set
of all of these x's that",00:01:24.070,00:01:27.730
satisfy this?,00:01:27.730,00:01:28.580
"Let me just write our
formal notation.",00:01:28.580,00:01:31.370
"The null space of A is the set
of all vectors that are a",00:01:31.370,00:01:38.260
"member of -- we generally say
Rn, but this is a 3 by 4",00:01:38.260,00:01:41.340
"matrix, so these are all the
vectors that are going to be",00:01:41.340,00:01:43.720
"members of R4, because I'm using
this particular A, such",00:01:43.720,00:01:48.730
"that my matrix A times any
of these vectors is",00:01:48.730,00:01:52.910
equal to the 0 vector.,00:01:52.910,00:01:54.530
"In this case it's going
to be 0 vector in R3.",00:01:54.530,00:01:59.400
So how do we do this?,00:01:59.400,00:02:00.420
"Well, this is just a straight
up linear equation.",00:02:00.420,00:02:02.680
We can write it that way.,00:02:02.680,00:02:04.100
"If we were to actually perform
the matrix multiplication, we",00:02:04.100,00:02:06.860
get 1 times x1.,00:02:06.860,00:02:07.830
Let me write it here.,00:02:07.830,00:02:09.010
"Let me do it in a
different color.",00:02:09.010,00:02:10.800
"1 times x1, plus 1 times x2,
plus 1 times x3, plus 1 times",00:02:10.800,00:02:19.920
x4 is equal to this 0 there.,00:02:19.920,00:02:26.460
"So that times that is
equal to that 0.",00:02:26.460,00:02:29.580
"And then this times this should
be equal to that 0.",00:02:29.580,00:02:32.500
"So 1 times x1, so you get x1,
plus 2 times x2, plus 3 times",00:02:32.500,00:02:41.430
"x3, plus 4 times x4 is going
to be equal to that 0.",00:02:41.430,00:02:47.710
"And then finally we have that
times this vector should be",00:02:47.710,00:02:51.510
equal to that 0.,00:02:51.510,00:02:52.990
"So the dot product of this row
vector with this column vector",00:02:52.990,00:02:58.770
should be equal to that 0.,00:02:58.770,00:03:00.220
So you get 4x1.,00:03:00.220,00:03:02.690
"4x1 plus 3x2 plus 2x1 plus 2x3
plus x4 is equal to 0.",00:03:02.690,00:03:21.690
"4x1 plus 3x2 plus 2x3 plus
x4 is equal to 0.",00:03:21.690,00:03:26.570
"You just have to find the
solution set to this and we'll",00:03:26.570,00:03:29.230
"essentially have figured
out our null space.",00:03:29.230,00:03:33.220
"Now, we've figured out the
solution set to systems of",00:03:33.220,00:03:35.920
equations like this.,00:03:35.920,00:03:36.770
"We have three equations
with four unknowns.",00:03:36.770,00:03:41.090
We can do that.,00:03:41.090,00:03:41.650
"We can represent this by an
augmented matrix and then put",00:03:41.650,00:03:44.610
"that in reduced row
echelon form.",00:03:44.610,00:03:46.370
Let's do that.,00:03:46.370,00:03:48.080
"I can represent this problem
as the augmented matrix.",00:03:48.080,00:03:50.865
"1, 1, 4.",00:03:54.750,00:03:57.260
"1, 2, 3.",00:03:57.260,00:04:00.070
"1, 3, 2.",00:04:00.070,00:04:03.550
"and then 1, 4, 1.",00:04:03.550,00:04:07.110
"And then I augment that
with the 0 vector.",00:04:07.110,00:04:10.495
"And the immediate thing you
should notice is we took the",00:04:10.495,00:04:12.720
"pain of multiplying this times
this to equal that, and we",00:04:12.720,00:04:16.610
"wrote this as a system of
equations, but now we want to",00:04:16.610,00:04:19.600
"solve the system of equations,
we're going back to the",00:04:19.600,00:04:21.980
augmented matrix world.,00:04:21.980,00:04:23.050
"What does this augmented
matrix look like?",00:04:23.050,00:04:25.290
"Well, this is just our
matrix A right there.",00:04:25.290,00:04:29.010
"That's just matrix A right
there, that's just the 0",00:04:29.010,00:04:31.570
vector right there.,00:04:31.570,00:04:32.880
"And to solve this, and we've
done this before, we're just",00:04:32.880,00:04:34.980
"going to put this augmented
matrix into row echelon form.",00:04:34.980,00:04:38.640
"What you're going to find is
when you put it into row",00:04:38.640,00:04:40.450
"echelon form, this right side's
not going to change at",00:04:40.450,00:04:43.230
"all, because no matter what you
multiply or subtract by,",00:04:43.230,00:04:45.680
"you're just doing it all times
0, so you just keep",00:04:45.680,00:04:47.930
ending up with 0.,00:04:47.930,00:04:48.870
"So as we put this into reduced
row echelon form, were",00:04:48.870,00:04:51.880
"actually just putting matrix A
into reduced echelon form.",00:04:51.880,00:04:55.760
"So let me do that, instead
of just talking about it.",00:04:55.760,00:04:59.110
"So let me start off by keeping
row 1 the same.",00:04:59.110,00:05:04.620
"Row 1 is 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.",00:05:04.620,00:05:10.570
"And then I want to eliminate
this 1 right here, so let me",00:05:10.570,00:05:14.630
"replace row 2 with row
2 minus row 1.",00:05:14.630,00:05:18.820
So 1 minus 1 is 0.,00:05:18.820,00:05:20.980
2 minus 1 is 1.,00:05:20.980,00:05:23.050
3 minus 1 is 2.,00:05:23.050,00:05:25.170
4 minus 1 is 3.,00:05:25.170,00:05:27.400
0 minus 0 is 0.,00:05:27.400,00:05:28.970
"You can see the 0's aren't
going to change.",00:05:28.970,00:05:31.490
"And then let me replace this
guy with 4 times this guy,",00:05:31.490,00:05:36.740
minus this guy.,00:05:36.740,00:05:38.480
So I can only get rid of this.,00:05:38.480,00:05:39.940
So 4 times 1 minus 4 is 0.,00:05:39.940,00:05:43.610
4 times 1 minus 3 is 1.,00:05:43.610,00:05:46.950
4 times 1 minus 2 is 2.,00:05:46.950,00:05:49.920
4 times 1 minus 1 is 3.,00:05:49.920,00:05:52.840
4 times 0 minus 0 is 0.,00:05:52.840,00:05:56.750
"Now I want to get rid of, if I
want to put this in reduced",00:05:56.750,00:05:59.490
"row echelon form, I want
to get rid of that",00:05:59.490,00:06:03.170
term and that term.,00:06:03.170,00:06:05.660
"So let me keep my middle
row the same.",00:06:05.660,00:06:08.920
"My middle row is 0, 1, 2, 3.",00:06:08.920,00:06:13.135
"So that's 0 on the augmented
side of it, although these 0's",00:06:16.380,00:06:19.330
"are never going to change, it's
really just a little bit",00:06:19.330,00:06:21.470
"of an exercise just to
keep writing them.",00:06:21.470,00:06:23.780
"And my first row, let me replace
it with the first row",00:06:23.780,00:06:26.140
"minus the second row, so I
can get rid of this 1.",00:06:26.140,00:06:28.360
So 1 minus 0 is 1.,00:06:28.360,00:06:30.720
1 minus 1 is 0.,00:06:30.720,00:06:33.410
1 minus 2 is minus 1.,00:06:33.410,00:06:36.140
1 minus 3 is minus 2.,00:06:36.140,00:06:38.340
And 0 minus 0 is 0.,00:06:38.340,00:06:41.390
"And let me replace this last
row with the last row minus",00:06:41.390,00:06:45.670
the middle row.,00:06:45.670,00:06:46.610
So 0 minus 0 is 0.,00:06:46.610,00:06:48.890
1 minus 1 is 0.,00:06:48.890,00:06:51.440
2 minus 2 is 0.,00:06:51.440,00:06:52.570
"I think you see where
this is going.",00:06:52.570,00:06:53.770
3 minus 3 is 0.,00:06:53.770,00:06:55.510
And obviously 0 minus 0 is 0.,00:06:55.510,00:06:58.790
"So this system of equations
has been reduced, just by",00:06:58.790,00:07:04.510
"doing reduce row echelon
form, this problem.",00:07:04.510,00:07:07.560
"If I just rewrite this right
here, this can be written as a",00:07:07.560,00:07:12.030
"system equations of x1 minus
x3 minus x4, right?",00:07:12.030,00:07:21.870
The 0 x2's is equal to 0.,00:07:21.870,00:07:25.110
"And then this second row right
here, there's no x1, you just",00:07:25.110,00:07:28.830
"have an x2, plus 2x3, plus 3x2
is equal to 0, and this",00:07:28.830,00:07:37.870
"obviously gives me no
information whatsoever.",00:07:37.870,00:07:41.420
And so I can solve this.,00:07:41.420,00:07:43.510
"I can solve this for x1 and
x2, and what do I get?",00:07:43.510,00:07:46.160
"I get x1 is equal
to x3 plus x4.",00:07:46.160,00:07:52.960
"Actually, I made
a mistake here.",00:07:52.960,00:07:54.170
"This is x1 minus x3 minus 2
times x4 is equal to 0.",00:07:54.170,00:08:01.000
"So if I rewrite this, I get x1
is equal to x3 plus 2x4.",00:08:01.000,00:08:05.000
And then I get x2.,00:08:07.720,00:08:11.290
Let me do that in green.,00:08:11.290,00:08:13.280
"x2 is equal to minus
2 x3 minus 3x2.",00:08:13.280,00:08:20.875
"So if I wanted to write the
solution set to this equation,",00:08:24.090,00:08:28.270
"if I wanted to write it in terms
of this, I could write",00:08:28.270,00:08:32.640
"x1, x2, x3, x4 is equal to
-- what's x1 equal to?",00:08:32.640,00:08:40.260
"It's equal to x3 times
1 plus x4 times 2.",00:08:40.260,00:08:54.400
Right?,00:08:54.400,00:08:54.720
"I just got this right here from
this equation right here.",00:08:54.720,00:08:57.500
"x1 is equal to 1 times
x3, plus 2 times x4.",00:08:57.500,00:09:01.600
"That's just that, right there.",00:09:01.600,00:09:03.320
"Now, x2 is equal to x3
times minus 2, plus",00:09:03.320,00:09:10.145
x4 times minus 3.,00:09:10.145,00:09:13.330
What am I doing?,00:09:13.330,00:09:14.410
I'm losing track of things.,00:09:14.410,00:09:16.050
"This x2 right here is x2 plus
2x3 plus 3x4 is equal to 0.",00:09:16.050,00:09:22.800
"So x2 is equal to minus
2x3, minus 3x4.",00:09:22.800,00:09:27.620
Right.,00:09:27.620,00:09:28.060
Like that.,00:09:28.060,00:09:28.280
"Sorry, my brain isn't completely
in the problem, I'm",00:09:28.280,00:09:31.900
making these silly mistakes.,00:09:31.900,00:09:33.730
"But I think you understand
this now.",00:09:33.730,00:09:35.270
So then what is x3 equal to?,00:09:35.270,00:09:36.990
"Well, it's just equal
to 1 times x3,",00:09:36.990,00:09:40.840
"plus 0 times x4, right?",00:09:40.840,00:09:42.580
x3 is equal to x3.,00:09:42.580,00:09:43.800
And what's x4 equal to?,00:09:43.800,00:09:44.770
"It's equal to 0 times
x3 plus 1 times x4.",00:09:44.770,00:09:48.420
"So all of the vectors in R4,
these are a member R4, which",00:09:48.420,00:09:53.220
"satisfy the equation, our
original equation, ax is equal",00:09:53.220,00:09:56.840
"to 0, can be represented as a
linear combination of these",00:09:56.840,00:10:01.210
"two vectors, of those

"These are just random scalars
that are a member of-- We can",00:10:03.980,00:10:07.020
"pick any real number for x3
and we could pick any real",00:10:07.020,00:10:10.210
number for x4.,00:10:10.210,00:10:12.810
"So our solution set is just a
linear combination of those",00:10:12.810,00:10:16.140
two vectors.,00:10:16.140,00:10:17.200
"What's another way of
saying a linear",00:10:17.200,00:10:19.060
combination of two vectors?,00:10:19.060,00:10:21.130
Let me write this.,00:10:21.130,00:10:22.470
"The null space of A, which is
just a solution set of this",00:10:22.470,00:10:27.530
"equation, it's just all the
x's that satisfy this",00:10:27.530,00:10:30.600
"equation, it equals all of the
linear combinations of this",00:10:30.600,00:10:34.090
vector and that vector.,00:10:34.090,00:10:35.530
"What do we call all the linear
combinations of two vectors?",00:10:35.530,00:10:38.780
"It's the span of those
two vectors.",00:10:38.780,00:10:41.330
"So it equals the span of that
vector and that vector.",00:10:41.330,00:10:45.000
"Of the vector 1, minus 2,
1, 0, and the vector",00:10:45.000,00:10:52.290
"2, minus 3, 0, 1.",00:10:52.290,00:10:57.840
And this is our null space.,00:10:57.840,00:11:00.490
"Before letting you go, let me
just point out one interesting",00:11:00.490,00:11:03.050
thing right here.,00:11:03.050,00:11:04.640
"We represented our system of
equation like this and we put",00:11:04.640,00:11:08.950
"it into reduced row echelon
form, so this is",00:11:08.950,00:11:11.130
A and this is 0.,00:11:11.130,00:11:12.700
"This right here is, let me make
sure I have some space,",00:11:12.700,00:11:16.840
let me put it right here.,00:11:16.840,00:11:17.600
"That right there is the reduced
row echelon form of A.",00:11:17.600,00:11:22.970
"And so where essentially this
equation, this is a linear",00:11:22.970,00:11:26.180
"equation that is trying
to solve this problem.",00:11:26.180,00:11:29.170
"The reduced row echelon form
of A times our vector x is",00:11:29.170,00:11:35.050
equal to 0.,00:11:35.050,00:11:36.530
"So, all the solutions to this
are also the solutions to our",00:11:36.530,00:11:40.580
"original problem, to our
original ax is equal to 0.",00:11:40.580,00:11:44.290
"So what's the solution
to this?",00:11:44.290,00:11:46.530
"All the x's that satisfy this,
these are the null space of",00:11:46.530,00:11:49.320
"the reduced row echelon
form of A.",00:11:49.320,00:11:52.470
Right?,00:11:52.470,00:11:53.110
"So here are all of the x's, this
is the null space, this",00:11:53.110,00:11:57.570
"problem, if we find all of the
x's here, this is the null",00:11:57.570,00:12:02.180
"space of the reduced row echelon
form of our matrix A.",00:12:02.180,00:12:06.315
"But we're saying that this
problem is the same problem as",00:12:06.315,00:12:10.030
"this one, right?",00:12:10.030,00:12:11.790
"So we can write that the null
space of A is equal to the",00:12:11.790,00:12:17.800
"null space of the reduced
row echelon form of A.",00:12:17.800,00:12:22.350
"And that might seem a little
bit confusing, hey, why are",00:12:22.350,00:12:25.000
"you even writing this out, but
it's the actually very useful",00:12:25.000,00:12:27.430
"when you're trying to calculate
null spaces.",00:12:27.430,00:12:29.860
"So we didn't even have
to write a big",00:12:29.860,00:12:31.240
augmented matrix here.,00:12:31.240,00:12:32.180
"We can say, take our matrix A,
put it in reduced row echelon",00:12:32.180,00:12:35.750
"form and then figure out
it's null space.",00:12:35.750,00:12:37.780
"We would have gone straight
to this point right here.",00:12:37.780,00:12:40.060
"This is the reduced row echelon
form of A, and then I",00:12:40.060,00:12:43.170
"could have immediately solved
these equations, right?",00:12:43.170,00:12:46.950
"I would have just taken the dot
product of the reduced row",00:12:46.950,00:12:49.040
"echelon form or, not the dot
product, the matrix vector",00:12:49.040,00:12:51.840
"product of the reduced row
echelon form of A with this",00:12:51.840,00:12:55.350
"vector, and I would've gotten
these equations, and then",00:12:55.350,00:12:57.800
"these equations would
immediately, I can just",00:12:57.800,00:13:00.150
"rewrite them in this
form, and I would",00:13:00.150,00:13:02.060
have gotten our result.,00:13:02.060,00:13:03.890
"But anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably useful.",00:13:03.890,00:13:07.180
