"The whole point in learning
differential equations is that",00:00:00.730,00:00:03.540
"eventually we want to model real
physical systems. I know",00:00:03.540,00:00:06.270
"everything we've done so far has
really just been a toolkit",00:00:06.270,00:00:09.330
"of being able to solve them, but
the whole reason is that",00:00:09.330,00:00:12.390
"because differential equations
can describe a lot of systems,",00:00:12.390,00:00:15.410
"and then we can actually
model them that way.",00:00:15.410,00:00:17.320
"And we know that in the real
world, everything isn't these",00:00:17.320,00:00:20.750
"nice continuous functions, so
over the next couple of videos",00:00:20.750,00:00:23.820
"we're going to talk about
functions that are a little",00:00:23.820,00:00:25.890
"bit more discontinuous than what
you might be used to even",00:00:25.890,00:00:28.880
"in kind of a traditional
calculus or traditional",00:00:28.880,00:00:31.460
Precalculus class.,00:00:31.460,00:00:32.880
"And the first one is the
unit step function.",00:00:32.880,00:00:36.910
"Let's write it as u, and
then I'll put a little",00:00:36.910,00:00:39.790
subscript c here of t.,00:00:39.790,00:00:43.290
"And it's defined as when t is--
let me put it this way.",00:00:43.290,00:00:48.110
"It's defined as 0 when t is less
than-- whatever subscript",00:00:48.110,00:00:52.150
"I put here-- when t
is less than c.",00:00:52.150,00:00:55.220
"And it's defined as 1-- that's
why we call it the unit step",00:00:55.220,00:00:58.380
"function-- when t is greater
than or equal to c.",00:00:58.380,00:01:02.900
"And if I had to graph this, and
you could graph it as well",00:01:02.900,00:01:05.700
"but it's not too difficult
to graph.",00:01:05.700,00:01:07.030
"Let me draw my x-axis
right here.",00:01:07.030,00:01:10.622
"And I'll do a little
thicker line.",00:01:10.622,00:01:13.010
That's my x-axis right there.,00:01:13.010,00:01:15.490
This is my y-axis right there.,00:01:15.490,00:01:20.430
"And when we talk about Laplace
transforms, which we'll talk",00:01:22.990,00:01:25.380
"about shortly, we only care
about t is greater than 0.",00:01:25.380,00:01:28.400
"Because we saw, in our
definition of the Laplace",00:01:28.400,00:01:30.090
"transform, we're always taking
the integral from 0 to",00:01:30.090,00:01:32.510
"infinity, so we're
only dealing with",00:01:32.510,00:01:34.360
the positive x-axis.,00:01:34.360,00:01:36.470
"But anyway, by this definition,
it would be zero",00:01:36.470,00:01:39.160
"all the way until you get to
some value c, so you'd be zero",00:01:39.160,00:01:43.970
until you get to c.,00:01:43.970,00:01:45.400
"And then at c, you jump, and the
point c is included x is",00:01:45.400,00:01:49.460
equal to c here.,00:01:49.460,00:01:51.220
"So it's included, so I'll put
a dot there, because it's",00:01:51.220,00:01:53.070
greater than or equal to c.,00:01:53.070,00:01:54.300
"You're at 1, so this
is 1 right here.",00:01:54.300,00:01:57.040
"And then you go forward
for all of time.",00:01:57.040,00:01:59.790
"And you're like, Sal, you just
said that differential",00:01:59.790,00:02:01.960
"equations, we're learning to
model things, why is this type",00:02:01.960,00:02:05.100
of a function useful?,00:02:05.100,00:02:06.760
"Well, in the real world,
sometimes you do have",00:02:06.760,00:02:08.580
"something that essentially jolts
something, that moves it",00:02:08.580,00:02:11.100
"from this position
to that position.",00:02:11.100,00:02:12.790
"And obviously, nothing can move
it immediately like this,",00:02:12.790,00:02:15.450
"but you might have some
system, it could be an",00:02:15.450,00:02:18.650
"electrical system or mechanical
system, where maybe",00:02:18.650,00:02:22.580
"the behavior looks something
like this, where maybe it",00:02:22.580,00:02:25.000
"moves it like that
or something.",00:02:25.000,00:02:26.680
"And this function is a pretty
good analytic approximation",00:02:26.680,00:02:30.090
"for some type of real world
behavior like this when",00:02:30.090,00:02:32.490
something just gets moved.,00:02:32.490,00:02:33.920
"Whenever we solve these
differential equations",00:02:33.920,00:02:36.010
"analytically, we're really
just trying to get a pure",00:02:36.010,00:02:38.540
model of something.,00:02:38.540,00:02:39.730
"Eventually, we'll see that it
doesn't perfectly describe",00:02:39.730,00:02:42.610
"things, but it helps describe
it enough for us to get a",00:02:42.610,00:02:44.730
"sense of what's going
to happen.",00:02:44.730,00:02:47.040
"Sometimes it will completely
describe things, but anyway,",00:02:47.040,00:02:49.820
"we can ignore that for now, so
let me get rid of these things",00:02:49.820,00:02:53.220
right there.,00:02:53.220,00:02:54.030
"So the first question is,
well, you know, what if",00:02:54.030,00:02:56.180
"something doesn't jar
just like that?",00:02:56.180,00:02:58.000
"What if I want to construct more
fancy unit functions or",00:02:58.000,00:03:03.500
more fancy step functions?,00:03:03.500,00:03:05.270
"Let's say I wanted to construct
something that",00:03:05.270,00:03:07.470
looked like this.,00:03:07.470,00:03:09.350
Let me say this is my y-axis.,00:03:09.350,00:03:13.940
This is my x-axis.,00:03:13.940,00:03:16.310
"And let's say I wanted to
construct something that is",00:03:16.310,00:03:18.700
"at-- and let me do it in
a different color.",00:03:18.700,00:03:23.820
"Let's say it's at 2
until I get to pi.",00:03:23.820,00:03:29.935
"And then from pi until forever
it just stays at zero.",00:03:33.450,00:03:40.410
"So how could I construct this
function right here using my",00:03:40.410,00:03:45.290
unit step function?,00:03:45.290,00:03:47.350
"So what if I had written
it as-- so my unit step",00:03:47.350,00:03:51.940
"function's at zero initially, so
what if I make it 2 minus a",00:03:51.940,00:03:57.630
"unit step function that
starts at pi?",00:03:57.630,00:04:04.100
"So if I define my function
here, will this work?",00:04:06.770,00:04:10.710
"Well, this unit step function,
when we pass pi, is only going",00:04:10.710,00:04:13.250
"to be equal to 1, but
we want this thing",00:04:13.250,00:04:14.970
to be equal to zero.,00:04:14.970,00:04:15.900
"So it has to be 2 minus 2, so
I'll have to put at 2 here,",00:04:15.900,00:04:18.820
and this should work.,00:04:18.820,00:04:20.010
"When we're at any value below
pi, when t is less than pi",00:04:20.010,00:04:26.730
"here, this becomes a zero,
so our function will just",00:04:26.730,00:04:29.970
"evaluate to 2, which
is right there.",00:04:29.970,00:04:32.870
"But as soon as we hit t is equal
to pi, that pi is the c",00:04:32.870,00:04:36.490
"in this example, as soon as
we hit that, the unit step",00:04:36.490,00:04:40.050
function becomes 1.,00:04:40.050,00:04:41.150
"We multiply that by 2, and we
have 2 minus 2, and then we",00:04:41.150,00:04:45.120
"end up here with zero,",00:04:45.120,00:04:48.650
"Now, that might be nice and
everything, but let's say you",00:04:48.650,00:04:50.810
wanted for it to go back up.,00:04:50.810,00:04:54.610
"Let's say that instead of it
going like this-- let me kind",00:04:54.610,00:05:03.600
"of erase that by overdrawing the
x-axis again-- we want the",00:05:03.600,00:05:07.180
function to jump up again.,00:05:07.180,00:05:09.510
We want it to jump up again.,00:05:09.510,00:05:10.860
"And lets say at some value,
let's say it's at 2pi, we want",00:05:10.860,00:05:14.150
the function to jump up again.,00:05:14.150,00:05:16.210
How could we construct this?,00:05:16.210,00:05:18.920
"And we could make it jump to
anything, but let's say we",00:05:18.920,00:05:20.630
want it to jump back to 2.,00:05:20.630,00:05:22.410
"Well, we could just add another
unit step function",00:05:22.410,00:05:25.290
"here, something that would have
been zero all along, all",00:05:25.290,00:05:28.810
the way up until this point.,00:05:28.810,00:05:30.270
"But then at 2pi, it jumps,
so in this case,",00:05:30.270,00:05:34.160
our c would be 2pi.,00:05:34.160,00:05:36.475
"That's our unit step function,
and we want it to jump to 2.",00:05:36.475,00:05:38.670
"This would just jump
to 1 by itself.",00:05:38.670,00:05:40.430
So let's multiply it by 2.,00:05:40.430,00:05:42.070
And now we have this function.,00:05:42.070,00:05:43.480
"So you could imagine, you
can make an arbitrarily",00:05:43.480,00:05:45.780
"complicated function of things
jumping up and down to",00:05:45.780,00:05:49.180
"different levels based on
different essentially linear",00:05:49.180,00:05:52.260
"combinations of these
unit step functions.",00:05:52.260,00:05:54.720
"Now, what if I wanted
to do something",00:05:54.720,00:05:56.090
a little bit fancier?,00:05:56.090,00:05:57.030
"What if I wanted to do something
that-- let's say I",00:05:57.030,00:05:59.990
"have some function that
looks like this.",00:05:59.990,00:06:05.420
Let me draw some function.,00:06:05.420,00:06:07.756
"I should draw straighter
than that.",00:06:07.756,00:06:09.340
I should have some standards.,00:06:09.340,00:06:11.950
"So let's say that just
my regular f of t--",00:06:11.950,00:06:16.860
"let me, this is x.",00:06:16.860,00:06:18.740
"Actually, why am I doing x?",00:06:18.740,00:06:20.030
This would be the t-axis.,00:06:20.030,00:06:21.700
We're doing the time domain.,00:06:21.700,00:06:22.940
It could have been x.,00:06:22.940,00:06:24.100
"And then we'll call
this f of t.",00:06:24.100,00:06:26.720
"So let me draw some
arbitrary f of t.",00:06:26.720,00:06:29.590
"Let's say my function looks
something crazy like that.",00:06:29.590,00:06:32.160
So this is my f of t.,00:06:35.100,00:06:37.980
"What if I'm modeling
a physical system",00:06:37.980,00:06:39.680
that doesn't do this?,00:06:39.680,00:06:40.910
"That actually at some point--
well, actually, let's say it",00:06:40.910,00:06:45.260
stays at zero.,00:06:45.260,00:06:47.330
"It stays at zero until
some value.",00:06:47.330,00:06:51.050
"Let's say it goes to zero
until-- I don't know, I'll",00:06:51.050,00:06:53.405
call that c again.,00:06:53.405,00:06:55.190
"And then at c, f of t
kind of starts up.",00:06:55.190,00:06:57.870
"So right at c, f of t should
start up, so it just kind of",00:06:57.870,00:07:03.140
goes like this.,00:07:03.140,00:07:05.620
"So essentially what we have here
is a combination of zero",00:07:05.620,00:07:09.270
"all the way, and then we
have a shifted f of t.",00:07:09.270,00:07:13.860
"So at c, we have a shifted f of
t, so it shifts that way.",00:07:13.860,00:07:18.600
"So how can we construct this
yellow function, where it's",00:07:18.600,00:07:21.960
"essentially a shifted version
of this green function, but",00:07:21.960,00:07:25.150
it's zero below c?,00:07:25.150,00:07:26.960
"This green function might
have continued.",00:07:26.960,00:07:29.020
"It might have gone something
like this.",00:07:29.020,00:07:31.320
"It might have, continued and
done something crazy, but what",00:07:31.320,00:07:34.325
"we did is we shifted it from
here to there, and then we",00:07:34.325,00:07:38.460
"zeroed out everything
before c.",00:07:38.460,00:07:40.440
So how could we do that?,00:07:40.440,00:07:41.870
"Well, just shifting this
function, you've learned in",00:07:41.870,00:07:44.880
"your Algebra II or your
precalculus classes, to shift",00:07:44.880,00:07:47.940
"a function by c to the right,
you just to replace your t",00:07:47.940,00:07:51.620
with a t minus c.,00:07:51.620,00:07:52.970
"So this function right here
is f of t minus c.",00:07:52.970,00:07:59.790
"And to make sure I get it right,
what I always do is I",00:07:59.790,00:08:02.960
"imagine, OK, what's going to
happen when t is equal to c?",00:08:02.960,00:08:06.270
"When t is equal to c, you're
going to have a c minus a c,",00:08:06.270,00:08:10.400
"and you're going
to have f of 0.",00:08:10.400,00:08:13.030
"So f of 0, it should
be the same.",00:08:13.030,00:08:15.840
"So when t is equal to c, this
value, the value of the",00:08:15.840,00:08:19.270
"function should be equivalent
to the value of the original",00:08:19.270,00:08:22.560
"green function at zero, so it's
equivalent to that value,",00:08:22.560,00:08:25.850
which makes sense.,00:08:25.850,00:08:27.110
"If we go up one more above c, so
let's say this is one more",00:08:27.110,00:08:31.110
"above c, so we get to this
point, if t is c plus 1, then",00:08:31.110,00:08:36.650
"when you put c plus 1 minus c,
you just have f of 1, and f of",00:08:36.650,00:08:40.390
"1 is really just this
point right here.",00:08:40.390,00:08:42.970
"And so it'll be that f of
1, so it makes sense.",00:08:42.970,00:08:45.650
"So as we move one forward here,
we're essentially at the",00:08:45.650,00:08:48.390
"same function value as we were
there, so the shift works.",00:08:48.390,00:08:52.350
"But I said that we have to
also-- if I just shifted this",00:08:52.350,00:08:55.320
"function, you would have all
this other stuff, because you",00:08:55.320,00:08:58.080
"would have had all this other
stuff when the function was",00:08:58.080,00:08:59.700
back here still going on.,00:08:59.700,00:09:02.500
The function-- I'll draw it,00:09:02.500,00:09:03.770
lightly-- would still continue.,00:09:03.770,00:09:05.810
"But I said I wanted to zero
out this function",00:09:05.810,00:09:08.330
before we reach c.,00:09:08.330,00:09:10.390
"So how can I zero out
that function?",00:09:10.390,00:09:12.800
"Well, I think it's pretty
obvious to you.",00:09:12.800,00:09:14.950
"I started this video talking
about the unit step function.",00:09:14.950,00:09:17.750
"So what if I multiply
the unit step",00:09:17.750,00:09:19.680
function times this thing?,00:09:19.680,00:09:21.280
What's going to happen?,00:09:21.280,00:09:22.990
"So what if I-- my new function,
I call it the unit",00:09:22.990,00:09:26.870
"step function up until c of
t times f of t minus c?",00:09:26.870,00:09:35.130
So what's going to happen?,00:09:35.130,00:09:37.210
"Until we get to c, the unit
step function is zero when",00:09:37.210,00:09:41.300
it's less than c.,00:09:41.300,00:09:42.250
"So you're going to have zero
times I don't care what this",00:09:42.250,00:09:44.700
"is Zero times anything is zero,
so this function is",00:09:44.700,00:09:48.070
going to be zero.,00:09:48.070,00:09:50.260
"Once you hit c, the unit step
function becomes 1.",00:09:50.260,00:09:53.900
"So once you pass c, this thing
becomes a 1, and you're just",00:09:53.900,00:09:57.710
"left with 1 times
your function.",00:09:57.710,00:09:59.320
"So then your function can behave
as it would like to",00:09:59.320,00:10:01.520
"behave, and you actually
shifted it.",00:10:01.520,00:10:03.450
"This t minus c is what actually
shifted this green",00:10:03.450,00:10:06.410
function over to the right.,00:10:06.410,00:10:08.210
"And this is actually
going to be a very",00:10:08.210,00:10:09.760
useful constructed function.,00:10:09.760,00:10:14.630
"And in a second, wer'e going
to figure out the Laplace",00:10:14.630,00:10:17.110
"transform of this, and you're
going to appreciate, I think,",00:10:17.110,00:10:19.820
"why this is a useful function
to look at.",00:10:19.820,00:10:22.220
"But now you understand at least
what it is and why it",00:10:22.220,00:10:26.800
"essentially shifts a function
and zeroes out everything",00:10:26.800,00:10:30.000
before that point.,00:10:30.000,00:10:32.520
"Well, I told you that this is
a useful function, so we",00:10:32.520,00:10:36.140
"should add its Laplace transform
to our library of",00:10:36.140,00:10:39.480
"Laplace transforms.
So let's do that.",00:10:39.480,00:10:42.720
"Let's take a the Laplace
transform of this, of the unit",00:10:42.720,00:10:49.410
step function up to c.,00:10:49.410,00:10:50.670
"I'm doing it in fairly general
terms. In the next video,",00:10:50.670,00:10:52.840
"we'll do a bunch of examples
where we can apply this, but",00:10:52.840,00:10:56.200
"we should at least prove to
ourselves what the Laplace",00:10:56.200,00:10:58.300
transform of this thing is.,00:10:58.300,00:11:01.000
"Well, the Laplace transform of
anything, or our definition of",00:11:01.000,00:11:04.400
"it so far, is the integral from
0 to infinity of e to the",00:11:04.400,00:11:09.260
minus st times our function.,00:11:09.260,00:11:12.630
"So our function in this case is
the unit step function, u",00:11:12.630,00:11:18.240
"sub c of t times f
of t minus c dt.",00:11:18.240,00:11:24.950
And this seems very general.,00:11:24.950,00:11:26.530
"It seems very hard to evaluate
this integral at first, but",00:11:26.530,00:11:29.670
"maybe we can make some form of
a substitution to get it into",00:11:29.670,00:11:32.540
a term that we can appreciate.,00:11:32.540,00:11:33.860
"So let's make a substitution
here.",00:11:33.860,00:11:36.940
"Let me pick a nice variable
to work with.",00:11:36.940,00:11:40.690
"I don't know, we're not
using an x anywhere.",00:11:40.690,00:11:42.370
We might as well use an x.,00:11:42.370,00:11:43.440
"That's the most fun variable
to work with.",00:11:43.440,00:11:47.980
"Sometimes, you'll see in a
lot of math classes, they",00:11:47.980,00:11:50.325
"introduce these crazy Latin
alphabets, and that by itself",00:11:50.325,00:11:53.060
makes it hard to understand.,00:11:53.060,00:11:54.660
"So I like to stay away from
those crazy Latin alphabets,",00:11:54.660,00:11:59.510
so we'll just use a regular x.,00:11:59.510,00:12:01.180
Let's make a substitute.,00:12:01.180,00:12:02.120
"Let's say that x is equal
to t minus c.",00:12:02.120,00:12:08.790
"Or you could, if we added t to
both sides, we could say that",00:12:08.790,00:12:11.560
t is equal to x plus c.,00:12:11.560,00:12:14.700
"Let's see what happens
to our subsitution.",00:12:14.700,00:12:16.600
"And also, if we took the
derivative of both sides of",00:12:16.600,00:12:19.220
"this, or I guess the
differential, you would get dx",00:12:19.220,00:12:22.360
is equal to dt.,00:12:22.360,00:12:23.965
"Or I mean, if you took dx with
respect to dt, you would get",00:12:23.965,00:12:27.460
"that to equal to 1. c
is just a constant.",00:12:27.460,00:12:30.040
"Then if you multiply both sides
by dt, you get dx is",00:12:30.040,00:12:32.900
"equal to dt, and that's
a nice substitution.",00:12:32.900,00:12:35.700
"So what is our integral going
to become with this",00:12:35.700,00:12:37.610
substitution?,00:12:37.610,00:12:39.100
"So our integral this
was t equals 0 to",00:12:39.100,00:12:42.670
t is equal to infinity.,00:12:42.670,00:12:44.520
"When t is equal to 0, what is
x going to be equal to?",00:12:44.520,00:12:51.880
"Well, x is going to be
equal to minus c.",00:12:51.880,00:12:57.080
"Actually, before I go there,
let me actually take a step",00:12:57.080,00:13:00.170
"back, because we
could progress.",00:13:00.170,00:13:03.350
We could go in this direction.,00:13:03.350,00:13:04.720
"But we could actually simplify
it more before we do that.",00:13:04.720,00:13:09.150
"Let's go back to out original
integral before we even made",00:13:09.150,00:13:11.680
our substitution.,00:13:11.680,00:13:13.010
"If we're taking the integral
from 0 to infinity of this",00:13:13.010,00:13:15.680
"thing, we already said what does
this integral look like",00:13:15.680,00:13:18.290
"or what does this function
look like?",00:13:18.290,00:13:20.750
It's zero.,00:13:20.750,00:13:21.750
"We have this unit step function
sitting right here.",00:13:21.750,00:13:26.870
"We have the unit step function
sitting right there.",00:13:26.870,00:13:29.650
"So this whole expression
is going to be zero",00:13:29.650,00:13:31.980
until we get to c.,00:13:31.980,00:13:33.980
"This whole thing, by definition,
this unit step",00:13:33.980,00:13:36.220
"function is zero until
we get to c.",00:13:36.220,00:13:38.400
"So this everything's going
to be zeroed out",00:13:38.400,00:13:40.400
until we get to c.,00:13:40.400,00:13:41.940
"So we could essentially say,
you know, we don't have to",00:13:41.940,00:13:44.890
"take the integral from t equals
0 to t equals infinity.",00:13:44.890,00:13:48.010
"We could take the integral--
let me write it here.",00:13:48.010,00:13:52.540
"I'll just use that old
integral sign.",00:13:52.540,00:13:54.450
"We could just take the integral
from t is equal to c",00:13:54.450,00:13:59.070
"to t is equal to infinity of e
to the minus st, the unit step",00:13:59.070,00:14:05.790
"function, uc of t times
f of t minus c dt.",00:14:05.790,00:14:12.280
"In fact, at this point, this
unit step function, it has no",00:14:12.280,00:14:16.990
use anymore.,00:14:16.990,00:14:18.280
"Because before t is equal to c,
it's 0, and now that we're",00:14:18.280,00:14:23.210
"only worried about values above
c, it's equal to 1, so",00:14:23.210,00:14:26.090
it equals 1 in this context.,00:14:26.090,00:14:28.440
"I want to make that
very clear to you.",00:14:28.440,00:14:30.240
What did I do just here?,00:14:30.240,00:14:31.320
"I changed our bottom boundary
from 0 to c.",00:14:31.320,00:14:35.340
"And I think you might realize
why I did it when I was",00:14:35.340,00:14:37.550
"working with the substitution,
because this will simplify",00:14:37.550,00:14:40.270
"things if we do this
ahead of time.",00:14:40.270,00:14:42.090
"So if we have this unit step
function, this thing is going",00:14:42.090,00:14:45.550
"to zero out this entire integral
before we get to c.",00:14:45.550,00:14:49.960
"Remember, this definite integral
is really just the",00:14:49.960,00:14:51.950
"area under this curve of this
whole function, of the unit",00:14:51.950,00:14:56.060
"step function times
all of this stuff.",00:14:56.060,00:14:57.980
"All of this stuff, when we
multiply it, is going to be",00:14:57.980,00:15:00.200
"zero until we get
to some value c.",00:15:00.200,00:15:03.050
"And then above c, it's going to
be e to the minus st times",00:15:03.050,00:15:05.620
f of t minus c.,00:15:05.620,00:15:06.760
"So it's going to start doing
all this crazy stuff.",00:15:06.760,00:15:08.820
"So if we want to essentially
find the area under this",00:15:08.820,00:15:12.610
"curve, we can ignore all the
stuff that happens before c.",00:15:12.610,00:15:16.840
"So instead of going from t
equals 0 to infinity, we can",00:15:16.840,00:15:19.520
"go from t is equal to c to
infinity because there was no",00:15:19.520,00:15:22.640
area before t was equal to c.,00:15:22.640,00:15:25.540
So that's all I did here.,00:15:25.540,00:15:26.960
"And then the other thing I said
is that the unit step",00:15:26.960,00:15:28.920
"function, it's going to be 1
over this entire range of",00:15:28.920,00:15:34.640
"potential t-values, so we can
just kind of ignore it.",00:15:34.640,00:15:38.420
"It's just going to be 1 this
entire time, so our integral",00:15:38.420,00:15:41.370
"simplifies to the definite
integral from t is equal to c",00:15:41.370,00:15:46.380
"to t is equal to infinity of e
to the minus st times f of t",00:15:46.380,00:15:53.440
minus is c dt.,00:15:53.440,00:15:56.025
"And this will simplify
it a good bit.",00:15:56.025,00:15:58.030
"I was going down the other
road when I did the",00:15:58.030,00:15:59.600
"substitution first, which would
have worked, but I think",00:15:59.600,00:16:01.830
"the argument as to why I could
have changed the boundaries",00:16:01.830,00:16:04.750
"would've been a harder
argument to make.",00:16:04.750,00:16:06.760
"So now that we had this, let's
go back and make that",00:16:06.760,00:16:09.900
"substitution that x is
equal to t minus c.",00:16:09.900,00:16:13.760
"So our integral becomes-- I'll
do it in green-- when t is",00:16:13.760,00:16:17.340
"equal to c, what is x?",00:16:17.340,00:16:18.990
"Then x is 0, right?",00:16:18.990,00:16:20.950
c minus c is 0.,00:16:20.950,00:16:22.440
"When t is equal to infinity,
what is x?",00:16:22.440,00:16:24.680
"Well x is, you know, infinity
minus any constant is still",00:16:24.680,00:16:26.720
"going to be infinity, or if
the limit is t approaches",00:16:26.720,00:16:29.460
"infinity, x is still going
to be infinity here.",00:16:29.460,00:16:32.920
"And it's the integral of e to
the minus s, but now instead",00:16:32.920,00:16:37.100
"of a t, we have the
substitution.",00:16:37.100,00:16:39.245
"If we said x is equal to t minus
c, then we can just add",00:16:39.245,00:16:42.530
"c to both sides and get t
is equal to x plus c.",00:16:42.530,00:16:45.660
"So you get x plus c there, and
then times the function f of t",00:16:45.660,00:16:53.830
"minus c, but we said t minus
c is the same thing as x.",00:16:53.830,00:16:58.230
"And dt is the same
thing is dx.",00:16:58.230,00:17:00.370
"I showed you that right there,
so we can write this as dx.",00:17:00.370,00:17:05.460
"Now this is starting to look
a little bit interesting.",00:17:05.460,00:17:08.700
So what is this equal to?,00:17:08.700,00:17:10.780
"This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity-- let me",00:17:10.780,00:17:14.730
"expand this out-- of e to
the minus sx minus sc",00:17:14.730,00:17:23.579
times f of x dx.,00:17:23.579,00:17:28.240
"Now, what is the equal to?",00:17:28.240,00:17:30.360
"Well, we could factor out an e
to the minus sc and bring it",00:17:30.360,00:17:34.500
"outside of the integral, because
this has nothing to do",00:17:34.500,00:17:36.300
"with what we're taking the
integral with respect to.",00:17:36.300,00:17:39.150
So let's do that.,00:17:39.150,00:17:39.970
"Let me take this guy out, and
maybe just to not confuse you,",00:17:39.970,00:17:44.530
"let me rewrite the
whole thing.",00:17:44.530,00:17:45.600
0 to infinity.,00:17:45.600,00:17:46.650
"I could rewrite this e term
as e-- actually, let me",00:17:46.650,00:17:50.010
write it this way.,00:17:50.010,00:17:51.460
"I'll do what was already in
green as e to the minus sx",00:17:51.460,00:17:55.930
times e to the minus sc.,00:17:55.930,00:18:00.820
Common base.,00:18:00.820,00:18:01.860
"So if I were to multiply these
two, I could just add the",00:18:01.860,00:18:05.800
"exponents, which you would
get that up there, times",00:18:05.800,00:18:10.430
"f of x, d of x.",00:18:10.430,00:18:14.580
"This is a constant term with
respect to x, so we can just",00:18:14.580,00:18:17.200
factor it out.,00:18:17.200,00:18:18.720
"We can just factor this thing
out right there, so then you",00:18:18.720,00:18:22.350
"get e to the minus sc times
the integral from 0 to",00:18:22.350,00:18:28.290
"infinity of e to the minus
sx times f of x dx.",00:18:28.290,00:18:37.810
"Now, what were we doing
here the whole time?",00:18:37.810,00:18:40.090
"We were taking the Laplace
transform of the unit step",00:18:40.090,00:18:49.070
"function that goes up to c, and
then it's 0 up to c, and",00:18:49.070,00:18:51.950
"it's 1 after that, of t times
some shifted function",00:18:51.950,00:18:58.000
f of t minus c.,00:18:58.000,00:19:01.680
"And now we got that as being
equal to this thing, and we",00:19:01.680,00:19:05.720
made a substitution.,00:19:05.720,00:19:06.710
We simplified it a little bit.,00:19:06.710,00:19:08.490
"e to the minus sc times the
integral from 0 to infinity of",00:19:08.490,00:19:16.610
e to the minus sx f of x dx.,00:19:16.610,00:19:21.600
"Something about the tablet
doesn't work properly right",00:19:21.600,00:19:24.180
around this period.,00:19:24.180,00:19:26.290
"But this should look
interesting to you.",00:19:26.290,00:19:30.920
What is this?,00:19:30.920,00:19:32.600
"This is the Laplace transform
of f of x.",00:19:32.600,00:19:35.470
Let me write that down.,00:19:35.470,00:19:36.280

of-- well, I could write it as",00:19:36.280,00:19:40.610

No difference.,00:20:00.960,00:20:01.790
They're just letters.,00:20:01.790,00:20:03.910

times f of y dy.",00:20:17.790,00:20:24.470

"All you're left with
is a function of s.",00:20:29.190,00:20:32.500
"This ends up being some capital,
well, you know, we",00:20:32.500,00:20:35.910
"could write some capital
function of s.",00:20:35.910,00:20:39.140
So this is interesting.,00:20:39.140,00:20:40.060
"This is the Laplace transform
of f of t times some scaling",00:20:40.060,00:20:44.680
"factor, and that's what
we set out to show.",00:20:44.680,00:20:48.060
"So we can now show that the
Laplace transform of the unit",00:20:48.060,00:20:54.790
"step function times some
function t minus c is equal to",00:20:54.790,00:21:02.700
"this function right here, e to
the minus sc, where this c is",00:21:02.700,00:21:07.870
"the same as this c right
here, times the Laplace",00:21:07.870,00:21:11.650
transform of f of t.,00:21:11.650,00:21:13.740
"Times the Laplace transform--
I don't know what's going on",00:21:13.740,00:21:17.370
"with the tablet right
there-- of f of t.",00:21:17.370,00:21:21.450
Let me write that.,00:21:21.450,00:21:22.100
"This is equal to-- because it's
looking funny there-- e",00:21:22.100,00:21:25.450
"to the minus sc times the
Laplace transform of f of t.",00:21:25.450,00:21:32.540
So this is our result.,00:21:32.540,00:21:33.865
"Now, what does this mean?",00:21:37.660,00:21:39.740
"Oh, look it back-filled
it somehow.",00:21:39.740,00:21:42.290
What does this mean?,00:21:42.290,00:21:43.180
What can we do with this?,00:21:43.180,00:21:45.285
"Well, let's say we wanted to
figure out the Laplace",00:21:45.285,00:21:50.420
"transform of the unit
step function that",00:21:50.420,00:21:53.910
starts up at pi of t.,00:21:53.910,00:21:56.200
"And let's say we're taking
something that we know well:",00:21:56.200,00:21:59.430
sine of t minus pi.,00:21:59.430,00:22:05.510
"So we shifted it, right?",00:22:05.510,00:22:08.570
"This thing is really
malfunctioning at this point",00:22:08.570,00:22:10.750
right here.,00:22:10.750,00:22:11.450
Let me pause it.,00:22:11.450,00:22:14.600
I just paused.,00:22:14.600,00:22:15.440
"Sorry if that was a little
disconcerting.",00:22:15.440,00:22:16.890
"I just paused the video because
it was having trouble",00:22:16.890,00:22:19.420
"recording at some point
on my little board.",00:22:19.420,00:22:21.950
"So let me rewrite the result
that we proved just now.",00:22:21.950,00:22:25.130
"We showed that the Laplace
transform of the unit step",00:22:25.130,00:22:29.430
"function t, and it goes to 1
at some value c times some",00:22:29.430,00:22:34.520
"function that's shifted
by c to the right.",00:22:34.520,00:22:38.820
"It's equal to e to the minus cs
times the Laplace transform",00:22:38.820,00:22:43.770
"of just the unshifted
function.",00:22:43.770,00:22:45.520
That was our result.,00:22:45.520,00:22:46.400
"That was the big takeaway
from this video.",00:22:46.400,00:22:48.630
"And if this seems like some
Byzantine, hard-to-understand",00:22:48.630,00:22:51.550
"result, we can apply it.",00:22:51.550,00:22:53.630
"So let's say the Laplace
transform, this is what I was",00:22:53.630,00:22:55.930
"doing right before the actual
pen tablet started",00:22:55.930,00:23:01.080
malfunctioning.,00:23:01.080,00:23:01.920
"If we want to take the Laplace
transform of the unit step",00:23:01.920,00:23:04.500
"function that goes to 1 at pi,
t times the sine function",00:23:04.500,00:23:09.610
"shifted by pi to the right, we
know that this is going to be",00:23:09.610,00:23:15.220
equal to e to the minus cs.,00:23:15.220,00:23:19.320
"c is pi in this case, so minus
pi s times the Laplace",00:23:19.320,00:23:24.700
"transform of the unshifted
function.",00:23:24.700,00:23:27.760
"So in this case, it's
the Laplace",00:23:27.760,00:23:29.030
transform of sine of t.,00:23:29.030,00:23:32.300
"And we know what the Laplace
transform of sine of t is.",00:23:32.300,00:23:36.460
"It's just 1 over s
squared plus 1.",00:23:36.460,00:23:41.250
"So the Laplace transform of this
thing here, which before",00:23:41.250,00:23:43.770
"this video seemed like something
crazy, we now know",00:23:43.770,00:23:47.720
is this times this.,00:23:47.720,00:23:49.090
"So it's e to the minus pi s
times this, or we could just",00:23:49.090,00:23:53.380
"write it as e to the minus pi
s over s squared plus 1.",00:23:53.380,00:23:58.900
"We'll do a couple more examples
of this in the next",00:23:58.900,00:24:00.990
"video, where we go back and
forth between the Laplace",00:24:00.990,00:24:02.900
"world and the t and between
the s domain",00:24:02.900,00:24:05.950
and the time domain.,00:24:05.950,00:24:06.810
"And I'll show you how this is a
very useful result to take a",00:24:06.810,00:24:10.730
"lot of Laplace transforms and
to invert a lot of Laplace",00:24:10.730,00:24:13.910
transforms.,00:24:13.910,00:24:15.160
