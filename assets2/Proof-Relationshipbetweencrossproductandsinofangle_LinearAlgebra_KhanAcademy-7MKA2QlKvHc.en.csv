"The goal of this video is to
start with our definition of",00:00:00.940,00:00:03.630
"the cross product and the result
that we started off",00:00:03.630,00:00:06.690
"with or that we got to in a
different video-- I think it",00:00:06.690,00:00:09.370
"was three videos ago-- where
we found out that the dot",00:00:09.370,00:00:12.610
"product of two nonzero vectors,
a dot b, is equal to",00:00:12.610,00:00:17.140
the product of their lengths.,00:00:17.140,00:00:19.070
"So the product of the length
of a with the length of b",00:00:19.070,00:00:23.540
"times the cosine of the
angle between them.",00:00:23.540,00:00:25.780
"We're going to start with
these two things.",00:00:25.780,00:00:27.310
"This definition of a cross
product in R3, the only place",00:00:27.310,00:00:30.680
"it really is defined, and
then this result.",00:00:30.680,00:00:33.290
"And we want to get to the result
that the length of the",00:00:33.290,00:00:42.300
cross product of two vectors.,00:00:42.300,00:00:44.870
"And so obviously, when
you take a cross",00:00:44.870,00:00:46.660
product you get a vector.,00:00:46.660,00:00:47.760
"But if you take its length you
get a number again, you just",00:00:47.760,00:00:49.910
"get a scalar value, is equal to
the product of each of the",00:00:49.910,00:00:53.580
vectors' lengths.,00:00:53.580,00:00:55.180
"It's the product of the length
of a times the product of the",00:00:55.180,00:00:57.610
"length of b times the sin of
the angle between them.",00:00:57.610,00:01:01.050
"Which is a pretty neat outcome
because it kind of shows that",00:01:01.050,00:01:03.590
"they're two sides of
the same coin.",00:01:03.590,00:01:05.200
"Dot product has cosine,
cross product has sin.",00:01:05.200,00:01:08.340
"I'm sure you've seen
this before.",00:01:08.340,00:01:11.320
"Well you definitely have seen
it if you've watched my",00:01:11.320,00:01:13.060
"physics playlist. And I even do
a whole video where I talk",00:01:13.060,00:01:16.360
"about the intuition behind
what this really means.",00:01:16.360,00:01:19.360
"And I encourage you to re-watch
that, and I'll",00:01:19.360,00:01:20.790
"probably do that again in the
linear algebra context.",00:01:20.790,00:01:23.180
"But the point of this video
is to prove this to you.",00:01:23.180,00:01:27.270
"Is to prove that with this and
this, I can get to this.",00:01:27.270,00:01:30.380
"Now if you're just believe me,
and you just say, oh I've seen",00:01:30.380,00:01:33.100
that before.,00:01:33.100,00:01:33.630
"And I just think it definitely
is the case, then you don't",00:01:33.630,00:01:36.270
"have to watch the rest of this
video because I'll tell you",00:01:36.270,00:01:38.380
"right now, it's going
to get dirty.",00:01:38.380,00:01:40.270
"It's going to be a hairy,
hairy proof.",00:01:40.270,00:01:42.340
"But if you're willing to watch
and bear with me, let's start",00:01:42.340,00:01:48.530
proving this result.,00:01:48.530,00:01:50.380
"So the place I'm going to start
is with the idea of",00:01:50.380,00:01:54.910
"taking the length of
a cross b squared.",00:01:54.910,00:02:01.570
That's a cross b right there.,00:02:01.570,00:02:03.080
"So I'm essentially taking the
length of this vector squared.",00:02:03.080,00:02:06.460
"And we saw in many videos and
I've used this idea multiple",00:02:06.460,00:02:09.860
"times, that if I just have some
arbitrary vector, let me",00:02:09.860,00:02:13.550
"just say some arbitrary
vector.",00:02:13.550,00:02:15.600
"And I take its length squared,
that's just equal to that",00:02:15.600,00:02:18.580
"vector dotted with itself or
the square of each of its",00:02:18.580,00:02:21.590
"terms summed up all the
way to xn squared.",00:02:21.590,00:02:26.420
So what will this be equal to?,00:02:26.420,00:02:28.410
"Well this is just equal
to that vector.",00:02:28.410,00:02:29.780
"And we only have three
components, so it's equal to",00:02:29.780,00:02:31.640
"the sum of the squares of each
of these components.",00:02:31.640,00:02:35.960
Let me write this down.,00:02:35.960,00:02:37.010
"It's equal to this
term squared.",00:02:37.010,00:02:41.410
So let me write that down.,00:02:41.410,00:02:43.020
a2 b3 minus a3 b2 squared.,00:02:43.020,00:02:50.750
Plus this term squared.,00:02:50.750,00:02:52.990
"So plus a3 b1 minus
a1 b3 squared.",00:02:52.990,00:03:02.490
"And then finally, plus
that term squared.",00:03:02.490,00:03:06.240
"So plus a1 b2 minus
a2 b1 squared.",00:03:06.240,00:03:15.560
And what is this equal to?,00:03:15.560,00:03:16.670
Well let's just expand it out.,00:03:16.670,00:03:18.590
Let's expand that out.,00:03:18.590,00:03:19.930
"So this term right here, we're
just going to have to do our",00:03:19.930,00:03:25.070
"expansion of the square
of a binomial.",00:03:25.070,00:03:27.550
"And we've done this
multiple times.",00:03:27.550,00:03:28.960
"So this is going to be equal
to a2 squared b3 squared.",00:03:28.960,00:03:35.120
"And then we're going to have
these two multiplied by each",00:03:35.120,00:03:37.180
other twice.,00:03:37.180,00:03:38.230
So minus 2.,00:03:38.230,00:03:40.030
I'm just multiplying this out.,00:03:40.030,00:03:41.150
Minus 2 times a2 a3 b2 b3.,00:03:41.150,00:03:46.740
"I'm just rearranging them
to get the order right.",00:03:46.740,00:03:49.460
Plus a3 squared b2 squared.,00:03:49.460,00:03:54.620
That term squared.,00:03:54.620,00:03:55.870
Then I have to add this term.,00:03:58.200,00:03:59.500
"So plus a3 squared b1 squared
minus 2 times both of these",00:03:59.500,00:04:08.490
terms multiplied.,00:04:08.490,00:04:09.370
Minus 2 times a1 a3 b1 b3.,00:04:09.370,00:04:16.019
Plus that term squared.,00:04:16.019,00:04:17.620
a1 squared b3 squared.,00:04:17.620,00:04:21.470
"And then finally, this
term squared.",00:04:21.470,00:04:24.190
"So plus a1 squared b2 squared
minus 2 times a1 a2 b1 b2.",00:04:24.190,00:04:37.240
Plus a2 squared b1 squared.,00:04:37.240,00:04:42.080
So there you go.,00:04:42.080,00:04:42.840
"And let's see if we can write
this in a form-- well, I'm",00:04:42.840,00:04:45.450
"going to write this in
a form that I know",00:04:45.450,00:04:47.090
will be useful later.,00:04:47.090,00:04:48.170
"So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to factor out the a2,",00:04:48.170,00:04:51.880
"a1, a3 squared terms. So I could
write this as-- let me",00:04:51.880,00:04:56.090
pick a new neutral color.,00:04:56.090,00:04:57.360
"So this is equal to, if I just
write a1 squared, where's my",00:04:57.360,00:05:01.940
a1 squared terms?,00:05:01.940,00:05:03.610
"I got that one right there and
I have that one right there.",00:05:03.610,00:05:07.070
"So a1 squared times b2 squared
plus b3 squared.",00:05:07.070,00:05:14.720
This would be 3 squared.,00:05:14.720,00:05:17.300
Good enough.,00:05:17.300,00:05:18.180
"Now where are my a2
squared terms?",00:05:18.180,00:05:20.370
"a plus a2 squared times-- I have
that one and that one.",00:05:20.370,00:05:25.800
So times b1 squared.,00:05:25.800,00:05:28.470
That's that.,00:05:28.470,00:05:29.050
Plus b3 squared.,00:05:29.050,00:05:30.300
"And then finally, let me
pick another new color.",00:05:33.480,00:05:37.220
I can go back to yellow.,00:05:37.220,00:05:38.870
"Plus a3 squared times--
well that's that",00:05:38.870,00:05:42.690
term and that term.,00:05:42.690,00:05:43.970
So b1 and b2.,00:05:43.970,00:05:45.510
So b1 squared plus b2 squared.,00:05:45.510,00:05:49.830
"And obviously, I can't forget
about all of that mess that I",00:05:49.830,00:05:52.760
"have in the middle, all of
this stuff right here.",00:05:52.760,00:05:55.450
"So plus, or maybe I should write
minus 2 times all of",00:05:58.470,00:06:03.680
this stuff.,00:06:03.680,00:06:04.250
"Let me just write it real fast.
So it's a2 a3 b2 b3 plus",00:06:04.250,00:06:11.580
a1 a3 b1 b3.,00:06:11.580,00:06:17.340
Plus a1 a2 b1 b2.,00:06:17.340,00:06:24.940
There you go.,00:06:24.940,00:06:25.440
"Now let's put this aside
for a little bit.",00:06:25.440,00:06:30.510
"Let me put this on the side
for a little bit.",00:06:30.510,00:06:34.540
"We'll let that equation rest
for a little while.",00:06:34.540,00:06:37.150
"And remember, this is just an
expansion of the length of a",00:06:37.150,00:06:40.990
cross b squared.,00:06:40.990,00:06:42.900
That's all this is.,00:06:42.900,00:06:44.040
So just remember that.,00:06:44.040,00:06:45.330
"And now, let's do another
equally hairy and cumbersome",00:06:45.330,00:06:48.660
computation.,00:06:48.660,00:06:50.350
"Let's take this result
up here.",00:06:50.350,00:06:53.990
"We know that the magnitude or
the length of a times the",00:06:53.990,00:06:58.150
"length of b times the angle
between them is",00:06:58.150,00:07:01.880
equal to a dot b.,00:07:01.880,00:07:04.680
"Which is the same thing as
if we actually do the dot",00:07:04.680,00:07:07.860
"product, a1 times b1 plus a2
times b2 plus a3 times b3.",00:07:07.860,00:07:17.670
"Now, just to kind of make sure
that I get to do the hairiest",00:07:17.670,00:07:22.830
"problem possible, let's take
the square of both sides.",00:07:22.830,00:07:27.800
"If we square this side,
you get a squared b",00:07:27.800,00:07:30.600
squared cosine squared.,00:07:30.600,00:07:32.630
"Then you got a dot b
squared or you get",00:07:32.630,00:07:35.260
this whole thing squared.,00:07:35.260,00:07:37.710
"So what's this whole
thing squared?",00:07:37.710,00:07:39.700
"For me, it's easier to just
write out the thing again.",00:07:39.700,00:07:41.980
"Instead of writing a square,
just multiply that times a1 b1",00:07:41.980,00:07:47.020
plus a2 b2 plus a3 b3.,00:07:47.020,00:07:52.050
"And let's do some polynomial
multiplication.",00:07:52.050,00:07:56.250
"So first, let's multiply this
guy times each of those guys.",00:07:56.250,00:07:59.270
"So you have a1 b1 times--
well there a1 b1.",00:07:59.270,00:08:03.380
I'm going to do it right here.,00:08:03.380,00:08:05.320
"You get a1 squared b1 squared
plus a1-- plus this",00:08:05.320,00:08:11.620
guy times this guy.,00:08:11.620,00:08:13.290
Plus a1 a2 times b1 b2.,00:08:13.290,00:08:22.650
Plus this guy times that guy.,00:08:22.650,00:08:24.530
Plus a1 a3 times b1 b3.,00:08:24.530,00:08:31.870
Fair enough.,00:08:31.870,00:08:33.120
Now let's do the second term.,00:08:33.120,00:08:35.250
"We have to multiply this guy
times each of those guys.",00:08:35.250,00:08:37.960
So a2 b2 times a1 b1.,00:08:37.960,00:08:40.960
"Well that's this
one right here.",00:08:40.960,00:08:42.870
a2 b2 times a1 b1.,00:08:42.870,00:08:50.560
"I wrote it right here because
this is really the same term",00:08:50.560,00:08:52.700
"and eventually, we want
to simplify that.",00:08:52.700,00:08:54.790
So that's that times that guy.,00:08:54.790,00:08:56.430
"Then we have this guy times
that over there.",00:08:56.430,00:08:59.990
So let me write it over here.,00:08:59.990,00:09:01.340
"So that's a2 squared
b2 squared.",00:09:01.340,00:09:07.860
Put a plus right there.,00:09:07.860,00:09:09.740
"And then finally, this middle
guy times this third guy.",00:09:09.740,00:09:13.910
So let me write it over here.,00:09:13.910,00:09:15.400
Plus-- so a2 a3 b2 b3.,00:09:15.400,00:09:27.410
"Now, we only have one left.",00:09:27.410,00:09:29.063
"Maybe I'll do it in
this blue color.",00:09:33.020,00:09:34.940
"I have to multiply this guy
times each of those guys.",00:09:34.940,00:09:37.620
So a3 b3 times a1 b1.,00:09:37.620,00:09:40.840
"That's the same thing as
this term right here.",00:09:40.840,00:09:43.030
Because you have a3.,00:09:43.030,00:09:45.240
Let me write it right here.,00:09:45.240,00:09:46.170
You have a3 b3 times a1 b1.,00:09:46.170,00:09:51.730
"Then you have this guy times
that guy, which is this",00:09:54.480,00:09:57.150
"because it's a3 b3
times a2 b2.",00:09:57.150,00:10:04.710
"Let me put a little
plus sign there.",00:10:04.710,00:10:06.390
"And then finally, you have
this guy times himself.",00:10:06.390,00:10:08.940
"So you have a3 squared
b3 squared.",00:10:08.940,00:10:14.170
"And so if you add up all
of this business",00:10:14.170,00:10:16.630
here what do you get?,00:10:16.630,00:10:17.880
I'll switch to another color.,00:10:21.420,00:10:24.050
"You have a1 squared
b1 squared.",00:10:24.050,00:10:30.870
"Plus, and I'm doing these colors
in a certain way on",00:10:30.870,00:10:33.180
"purpose, plus a2 squared
b2 squared.",00:10:33.180,00:10:37.570
Plus a3 squared b3 squared.,00:10:40.670,00:10:45.800
"Plus, and let me do it in this,
I'll do it in white.",00:10:45.800,00:10:49.950
"Plus, what do you have here?",00:10:49.950,00:10:51.250
You have this term times 2.,00:10:51.250,00:10:53.640
You have this term times 2.,00:10:53.640,00:10:56.880
"And then you have this
term times 2.",00:10:56.880,00:10:58.700
"So plus 2 times a1-- let
me write that down.",00:10:58.700,00:11:03.970
"Plus 2 times a1 a2 b1 b2--
that's that term.",00:11:03.970,00:11:11.490
Plus this one right here.,00:11:11.490,00:11:12.920
Plus a1 a3 b1 b3.,00:11:12.920,00:11:18.040
"Finally, plus this one.",00:11:18.040,00:11:19.790
a2 a3 plus b2 b3.,00:11:19.790,00:11:24.860
"And you might have noticed
something interesting already.",00:11:24.860,00:11:28.000
"If you compare this term right
here, if you compare that guy",00:11:28.000,00:11:32.640
"right there to this guy right
there, they're the same thing.",00:11:32.640,00:11:36.600
"You have an a1 a2 b1
b2, a1 a2 b1 b2.",00:11:36.600,00:11:40.260
"This term and that term
are the same.",00:11:40.260,00:11:43.340
"Let's look at the other terms.
Let me pick a nice color.",00:11:43.340,00:11:46.200
"a1 a3 b1 b3, a1 a3 b1 b3.",00:11:46.200,00:11:49.300
"That term and that
term is the same.",00:11:49.300,00:11:52.140
"And then finally, if you
compare a2 a3 b2 b3.",00:11:52.140,00:11:57.130
This shouldn't be a plus.,00:11:57.130,00:11:57.920
This is just this one.,00:11:57.920,00:11:58.760
"So a2 a3-- they're
all multiplied.",00:11:58.760,00:12:02.240
"a2 a3 b2 b3, a2 a3 b2 b3.",00:12:02.240,00:12:05.530
"This term and this
term is the same.",00:12:05.530,00:12:08.020
"And in this expression, when we
expanded it out, we have 2",00:12:08.020,00:12:10.850
"times this, positive
2 times this.",00:12:10.850,00:12:12.840
"And this term right here when
we expanded it out, we have",00:12:12.840,00:12:15.780
minus 2 times this.,00:12:15.780,00:12:19.190
"So let's see if we can simplify
things a little bit.",00:12:19.190,00:12:22.220
"So what happens if we add
this guy to this guy?",00:12:22.220,00:12:27.490
Let's do it.,00:12:27.490,00:12:29.780
So it's a little exciting.,00:12:29.780,00:12:31.740
"So we get a cross b, the
length of that squared.",00:12:31.740,00:12:37.150
"And we're going to add to that
this expression right here, so",00:12:37.150,00:12:40.310
"plus the length of a squared
times the length of b squared",00:12:40.310,00:12:47.130
"times the cosine of the angle
between them squared.",00:12:47.130,00:12:50.180
What's that going to equal?,00:12:50.180,00:12:51.490
"It's going to be equal to this
thing plus this thing.",00:12:51.490,00:12:55.610
Let's do a simplification.,00:12:55.610,00:12:56.810
"What's this thing
plus this thing?",00:12:56.810,00:12:58.680
"Well we already said this is
the minus 2 times this.",00:12:58.680,00:13:01.560
This is the plus 2 times this.,00:13:01.560,00:13:03.650
"So this guy-- let me
be very clear.",00:13:03.650,00:13:07.000
"This right here is going
to cancel out.",00:13:07.000,00:13:10.200
"When we add the two terms
it's going to cancel",00:13:10.200,00:13:12.360
out with this guy.,00:13:12.360,00:13:13.170
"These guys are going
to cancel out.",00:13:13.170,00:13:14.740
Thank God.,00:13:14.740,00:13:17.750
Cancel out.,00:13:17.750,00:13:18.550
"Makes our life a little
bit easier.",00:13:18.550,00:13:19.730
And what are we left with?,00:13:19.730,00:13:20.620
"We're left with this right here
plus that right there.",00:13:20.620,00:13:25.810
"Then we see we have an a1
squared term, so we just add",00:13:25.810,00:13:28.160
"the coefficients on
the a1 squared.",00:13:28.160,00:13:29.690
"We add the coefficients
of the a2 squared.",00:13:29.690,00:13:31.300
"We add the coefficients
of the a3 squared,",00:13:31.300,00:13:32.900
and what do we get?,00:13:32.900,00:13:34.280
"We get a1 squared times this
coefficient plus this",00:13:34.280,00:13:41.560
coefficient.,00:13:41.560,00:13:42.340
"So you get b1 squared plus b2
squared plus b3 squared.",00:13:42.340,00:13:48.040
"Things are starting to
look a little bit",00:13:48.040,00:13:49.700
orderly all of a sudden.,00:13:49.700,00:13:51.470
"And then you have plus a2
squared times all of their",00:13:51.470,00:13:57.930
coefficients added up.,00:13:57.930,00:13:58.900
"So b1 squared plus b2 squared
plus b3 squared.",00:13:58.900,00:14:05.300
"And then finally, in yellow,
you have plus a3-- sorry, I",00:14:05.300,00:14:11.470
"was trying to do
that in yellow.",00:14:11.470,00:14:14.240
"You have a3 squared
and you have that.",00:14:14.240,00:14:18.180
"You have b1 squared, b2 squared
and b3 squared.",00:14:18.180,00:14:21.410
"So b1 squared plus b2 squared
plus b3 squared.",00:14:21.410,00:14:26.540
"And as you see, we're
multiplying all of these",00:14:26.540,00:14:28.240
"things by this b1 squared plus
b2 squared plus b3 squared, so",00:14:28.240,00:14:31.543
"we can actually factor that out
and we get something very",00:14:31.543,00:14:34.520
interesting.,00:14:34.520,00:14:35.140
"So this is equal to, if we
factor this thing out of all",00:14:35.140,00:14:40.260
"the terms, we get b1 squared
plus b2 squared plus b3",00:14:40.260,00:14:45.340
"squared times my a squared
terms. Times a1 squared plus",00:14:45.340,00:14:51.010
"a2 squared plus a-- I'm getting
excited, the home",00:14:51.010,00:14:55.250
stretch is here-- a3 squared.,00:14:55.250,00:14:58.580
"So these two things are
equal to each other.",00:14:58.580,00:15:01.360
But what's this thing?,00:15:01.360,00:15:02.270
"What's another way I
could write this?",00:15:02.270,00:15:04.320
"This is the same thing as b
dot b or the length of my",00:15:04.320,00:15:09.960
vector b squared.,00:15:09.960,00:15:11.720
And what's that?,00:15:11.720,00:15:12.980
"That's the length of my
vector a squared.",00:15:12.980,00:15:15.460
"This is my length of my
vector a squared.",00:15:15.460,00:15:18.850
That's just a dot a.,00:15:18.850,00:15:21.740
Let me rewrite everything.,00:15:21.740,00:15:24.050
"So we have the length of a--
that's a darker green.",00:15:24.050,00:15:29.230
"a cross b squared
plus this thing.",00:15:29.230,00:15:34.150
"Plus the length of-- plus,
let me actually just",00:15:34.150,00:15:40.320
copy and paste it.,00:15:40.320,00:15:41.400
It gets monotonous.,00:15:41.400,00:15:42.720
Plus that thing right there.,00:15:42.720,00:15:44.370
Why isn't it?,00:15:47.620,00:15:49.535
"If I control, copy and paste.",00:15:49.535,00:15:52.010
So it's not working.,00:15:52.010,00:15:53.370
"All right, so plus that thing.",00:15:53.370,00:15:57.520
"The length of a squared times
the length of b squared times",00:15:57.520,00:16:01.200
"the cosine of the angle
squared between",00:16:01.200,00:16:03.560
them is equal to that.,00:16:03.560,00:16:04.950
"Now what if we subtract
this from both sides?",00:16:04.950,00:16:10.120
What do we get?,00:16:10.120,00:16:11.140
"We get the length of a cross
b squared is equal",00:16:11.140,00:16:17.720
to this minus this.,00:16:17.720,00:16:19.720
"And we can factor-- so
let me write that.",00:16:19.720,00:16:22.450
"Actually, let me just subtract
this on this line.",00:16:22.450,00:16:24.240
"So if I subtract it from both
sides, I could get that out",00:16:24.240,00:16:27.680
"there and I'll put the minus the
length of a squared times",00:16:27.680,00:16:32.220
"the length of b squared times
the cosine squared of the",00:16:32.220,00:16:36.430
angle between them.,00:16:36.430,00:16:37.680
"And we can factor this a squared
b squared, the lengths",00:16:37.680,00:16:41.200
"of the two vectors out, right?",00:16:41.200,00:16:42.680
I'm just switching the order.,00:16:42.680,00:16:43.630
"So this is equal to the lengths
of a squared times the",00:16:43.630,00:16:49.170
"length of b squared times-- and
this is exciting-- time,",00:16:49.170,00:16:56.150
"when you factor this out of
this, you just get a 1, minus",00:16:56.150,00:17:00.100
cosine squared of theta.,00:17:00.100,00:17:03.120
"And what is 1 minus cosine
squared of theta?",00:17:03.120,00:17:06.380
"Well, sin squared of theta plus
cosine-- this is the most",00:17:06.380,00:17:09.290
basic trig identity.,00:17:09.290,00:17:10.460
"Sin squared of theta plus cosine
squared of theta is",00:17:10.460,00:17:15.290
equal to 1.,00:17:15.290,00:17:16.440
"So if you subtract cosine
squared from both sides you",00:17:16.440,00:17:19.240
"get sin squared of theta is
equal to 1 minus cosine",00:17:19.240,00:17:23.140
squared of theta.,00:17:23.140,00:17:24.010
"So this is sin squared
of theta.",00:17:24.010,00:17:29.310
"And then what happens if
you take the square",00:17:29.310,00:17:30.650
root of both sides?,00:17:30.650,00:17:32.510
This is really exciting.,00:17:32.510,00:17:34.250
"You get the length of vector a
crossed with vector b is equal",00:17:34.250,00:17:40.530
"to the length of vector a times
the length of vector b",00:17:40.530,00:17:46.450
"times the sin of the
angle between them.",00:17:46.450,00:17:50.120
"I just took the square root
of both sides of this.",00:17:50.120,00:17:51.790
And we finally get our result.,00:17:51.790,00:17:53.460
"I never thought I
would get here.",00:17:53.460,00:17:55.340
"And so hopefully you're
satisfied.",00:17:55.340,00:17:56.820
"You never have to take
this as kind of a",00:17:56.820,00:17:58.200
leap of faith anymore.,00:17:58.200,00:17:59.690
"And hopefully you're satisfied
with this.",00:17:59.690,00:18:01.470
"And I'm going to stop recording
this video before I",00:18:01.470,00:18:04.020
"make a careless mistake or the
power goes out; that would",00:18:04.020,00:18:06.410
ruin everything.,00:18:06.410,00:18:08.000
