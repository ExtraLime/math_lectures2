"Let's keep doing some Laplace
transforms. For one, it's good",00:00:00.710,00:00:03.620
"to see where a lot of those
Laplace transform tables",00:00:03.620,00:00:06.580
"you'll see later on actually
come from, and it just makes",00:00:06.580,00:00:09.210
"you comfortable with
the mathematics.",00:00:09.210,00:00:10.780
"Which is really just kind of
your second semester calculus",00:00:10.780,00:00:14.340
"mathematics, but it makes you
comfortable with the whole",00:00:14.340,00:00:16.230
notion of what we're doing.,00:00:16.230,00:00:17.630
"So first of all, let me just
rewrite the definition of the",00:00:17.630,00:00:21.110
Laplace transform.,00:00:21.110,00:00:21.865
"So it's the L from Laverne
&amp; Shirley.",00:00:21.865,00:00:24.990
"So the Laplace transform of some
function of t is equal to",00:00:24.990,00:00:29.780
"the improper integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus",00:00:29.780,00:00:36.700
st times our function.,00:00:36.700,00:00:40.120
"Times our function of t, and
that's with respect to dt.",00:00:40.120,00:00:43.180
"So let's do another
Laplace transform.",00:00:43.180,00:00:45.030
"Let's say that we want to take
the Laplace transform-- and",00:00:45.030,00:00:52.830
"now our function f of t, let's
say it is e to the at.",00:00:52.830,00:00:58.765
"Laplace transform
of e to the at.",00:01:01.640,00:01:03.850
"Well we just substituted it into
this definition of the",00:01:03.850,00:01:06.160
Laplace transform.,00:01:06.160,00:01:07.410
"And this is all going to be
really good integration",00:01:09.825,00:01:13.040
practice for us.,00:01:13.040,00:01:13.760
"Especially integration
by parts.",00:01:13.760,00:01:15.180
"Almost every Laplace transform
problem turns into an",00:01:15.180,00:01:17.910
integration by parts problem.,00:01:17.910,00:01:20.370
"Which, as we learned long ago,
integration by parts is just",00:01:20.370,00:01:23.740
the reverse product rule.,00:01:23.740,00:01:26.070
So anyway.,00:01:26.070,00:01:26.840
"This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity.",00:01:26.840,00:01:30.380
"e to the minus st times
e to the at, right?",00:01:30.380,00:01:39.300
That's our f of t.,00:01:39.300,00:01:41.150
dt.,00:01:41.150,00:01:43.600
"Well this is equal to just
adding the exponents because",00:01:43.600,00:01:46.500
we have the same base.,00:01:46.500,00:01:47.670
"The integral from 0
to infinity of e",00:01:47.670,00:01:52.160
to the a minus stdt.,00:01:52.160,00:01:59.630
"And what's the antiderivative
of this?",00:02:04.350,00:02:07.780
Well that's equal to what?,00:02:07.780,00:02:12.400
With respect to C.,00:02:12.400,00:02:13.160
"So it's equal to-- a minus s,
that's just going to be a",00:02:13.160,00:02:20.150
"constant, right?",00:02:20.150,00:02:20.920
"So we can just leave it
out on the outside.",00:02:20.920,00:02:22.710
"1/a minus s times e to the a
minus st. And we're going to",00:02:22.710,00:02:35.720
"evaluate that from t is equal to
infinity or the limit as t",00:02:35.720,00:02:39.760
"approaches infinity to
t is equal to 0.",00:02:39.760,00:02:41.940
"And I could have put this inside
the brackets, but it's",00:02:41.940,00:02:44.270
"just a constant term, right?",00:02:44.270,00:02:46.190
"None of them have t's in them,
so I can just pull them out.",00:02:46.190,00:02:48.820
"And so this is equal to 1/a
minus s times-- now we",00:02:48.820,00:02:58.260
"essentially have to evaluate
t at infinity.",00:02:58.260,00:03:00.340
"So what is the limit
at infinity?",00:03:00.340,00:03:03.190
"Well we have two cases
here, right?",00:03:03.190,00:03:05.400
"If this exponent-- if this a
minus s is a positive number,",00:03:05.400,00:03:12.510
"if a minus s is greater than
0, what's going to happen?",00:03:12.510,00:03:17.700
"Well as we approach infinity,
e to the infinity just gets",00:03:17.700,00:03:20.910
"bigger and bigger and
bigger, right?",00:03:20.910,00:03:22.260
"Because it's e to an infinitely
positive exponent.",00:03:22.260,00:03:25.250
So we don't get an answer.,00:03:25.250,00:03:28.540
"And when you do improper
integrals, when you take the",00:03:28.540,00:03:32.050
"limit to infinity and it doesn't
come to a finite",00:03:32.050,00:03:35.590
"number, the limit doesn't
approach anything, that means",00:03:35.590,00:03:38.850
"that k the improper
integral diverges.",00:03:38.850,00:03:42.750
And so there is no limit.,00:03:42.750,00:03:44.025
"And to some degree, we can say
that the Laplace transform is",00:03:46.580,00:03:50.250
"not defined with a minus s is
greater than 0 or when a is",00:03:50.250,00:03:55.480
greater than s.,00:03:55.480,00:03:57.040
"Now what happens if a minus
s is less than 0?",00:03:57.040,00:04:00.665
"Well then this is going
to be some negative",00:04:05.220,00:04:08.270
"number here, right?",00:04:08.270,00:04:09.620
"And then if we take e to an
infinitely negative number,",00:04:09.620,00:04:12.740
"well then that does approach
something.",00:04:12.740,00:04:14.450
That approaches 0.,00:04:14.450,00:04:15.690
"And we saw that in the
previous video.",00:04:15.690,00:04:18.860
"And I hope you understand
what I'm saying, right?",00:04:18.860,00:04:20.820
"e to an infinity negative number
approaches 0, while e",00:04:20.820,00:04:25.830
"to an infinitely positive
number is just infinity.",00:04:25.830,00:04:27.670
"So that doesn't really
converge on anything.",00:04:27.670,00:04:29.980
So anyway.,00:04:29.980,00:04:31.420
"If I assumed that a minus s is
less than 0, or a is less than",00:04:31.420,00:04:36.250
"s, and this is the assumption I
will make, just so that this",00:04:36.250,00:04:43.990
"improper integral actually
converges to something.",00:04:43.990,00:04:46.140
"So if a minus s is less than
0, and this is a negative",00:04:46.140,00:04:49.410
"number, e to the a minus s
times-- well t, where t",00:04:49.410,00:04:53.470
approaches infinity will be 0.,00:04:53.470,00:04:56.700
"Minus this integral
evaluated at 0.",00:04:56.700,00:05:00.230
"So when you value this
at 0, what happens?",00:05:00.230,00:05:02.220
T equals 0.,00:05:02.220,00:05:03.140
"This whole thing becomes
e to the 0 is 1.",00:05:03.140,00:05:05.520
And we are left with what?,00:05:09.400,00:05:10.980
Minus 1/a minus s.,00:05:10.980,00:05:13.875
"And that's just the same
thing as 1/s s minus a.",00:05:13.875,00:05:19.710
"So we have our next entry in our
Laplace transform table.",00:05:19.710,00:05:26.540
"And that is the Laplace
transform.",00:05:26.540,00:05:30.670
"The Laplace transform of e to
the at is equal to 1/s s minus",00:05:30.670,00:05:41.800
"a, as long as we make the
assumption that s is",00:05:41.800,00:05:45.650
greater than a.,00:05:45.650,00:05:48.790
"This is true when s is greater
than a, or a is less than s.",00:05:48.790,00:05:53.930
You could view it either way.,00:05:53.930,00:05:54.710
"So that's our second entry in
our Laplace transform table.",00:05:54.710,00:06:00.350
Fascinating.,00:06:00.350,00:06:01.310
"And actually, let's relate this
to our previous entry in",00:06:01.310,00:06:04.460
"our Laplace transform
table, right?",00:06:04.460,00:06:05.970
"What was our first entry in our
Laplace transform table?",00:06:05.970,00:06:09.350
"It was Laplace transform of
1 is equal to 1/s, right?",00:06:09.350,00:06:15.810
"Well isn't 1 just the same
thing as e to the 0?",00:06:15.810,00:06:19.730
"So we could have said that this
is the Laplace-- I know",00:06:19.730,00:06:21.930
"I'm running out of space, but
I'll do it here in purple.",00:06:21.930,00:06:24.280
"We could have said Laplace
transform of 1 is the same",00:06:24.280,00:06:26.780
"thing as e to the 0
times t, right?",00:06:26.780,00:06:31.790
And that equals 1/s.,00:06:31.790,00:06:34.170
"And luckily it's good to see
that that is consistent.",00:06:34.170,00:06:37.075
"And actually, remember, we even
made the condition when s",00:06:37.075,00:06:39.950
"is greater than 0, right?",00:06:39.950,00:06:41.350
"We assumed that s is greater
than 0 this example.",00:06:41.350,00:06:43.565
"Here again, you say s
is greater than 0.",00:06:46.490,00:06:48.820
"This is completely consistent
with this one, right?",00:06:48.820,00:06:51.920
"Because if a is equal to 0, then
the Laplace transform of",00:06:51.920,00:06:55.600
"e to the 0 is just
1/s minus 0.",00:06:55.600,00:06:58.360
That's just 1/s.,00:06:58.360,00:06:59.690
"And we have to assume that
s is greater than zero.",00:06:59.690,00:07:01.950
"So really these are kind of the
same entry in our Laplace",00:07:01.950,00:07:05.895
transform table.,00:07:05.895,00:07:06.980
"But it's always nice in
mathematics when we see that",00:07:06.980,00:07:09.840
"two results we got in trying
to do slightly different",00:07:09.840,00:07:13.740
"problems actually are,
in some ways,",00:07:13.740,00:07:15.730
connected or the same result.,00:07:15.730,00:07:17.660
"Anyway I'll see you in the
next video and we'll keep",00:07:17.660,00:07:20.320
"trying to build our table of
Laplace transforms. And maybe",00:07:20.320,00:07:23.570
"three or four videos from now
I'll actually show you how",00:07:23.570,00:07:26.130
"these transforms are extremely
useful in solving all sorts of",00:07:26.130,00:07:31.180
differential equations.,00:07:31.180,00:07:32.080
See you soon.,00:07:32.080,00:07:33.710
