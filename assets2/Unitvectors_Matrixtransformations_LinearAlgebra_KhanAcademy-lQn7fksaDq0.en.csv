"We covered the idea of vector
length many, many videos ago.",00:00:00.560,00:00:07.100
"And I realize that I forgot to
cover an important topic.",00:00:07.100,00:00:09.780
"This topic's going to be useful
when we do some types",00:00:09.780,00:00:12.580
"of transformation -- actually,
the projections that I'll do",00:00:12.580,00:00:15.010
in the next video.,00:00:15.010,00:00:16.300
"The notion that I forgot
to do is the",00:00:16.300,00:00:17.850
notion of a unit vector.,00:00:17.850,00:00:19.650
"And all this is, is a vector
that has a length of 1.",00:00:23.220,00:00:32.176
"Has length and we've
defined length.",00:00:32.176,00:00:35.830
It has a length of 1.,00:00:35.830,00:00:38.610
"So if something is a unit
vector, let's say that u here",00:00:38.610,00:00:43.020
"is a unit vector, and
it's a member of Rn.",00:00:43.020,00:00:48.040
"Then that means that if we have
u, u looks like this, has",00:00:51.300,00:00:54.560
"n components, u2 all
the way to un.",00:00:54.560,00:00:58.920
"We know what the length
of this is, right?",00:00:58.920,00:01:03.160
"We know that the length of u,
sometimes called the norm of",00:01:03.160,00:01:07.070
"u, it's just equal to the square
root of the squared",00:01:07.070,00:01:10.200
sums of all of its components.,00:01:10.200,00:01:11.950
"And if you think about it, this
is just an extension of",00:01:11.950,00:01:14.570
"the Pythagorean theorem,
to some degree.",00:01:14.570,00:01:16.830
"So it's u1 squared plus
u2 squared all",00:01:16.830,00:01:21.560
the way to un squared.,00:01:21.560,00:01:25.250
"And it's the square
root of that.",00:01:25.250,00:01:27.780
"If this is a unit vector, if
this is a unit vector, so this",00:01:27.780,00:01:32.250
"is a unit vector, that implies
that the length of u will be",00:01:32.250,00:01:40.780
equal to 1.,00:01:40.780,00:01:42.310
"And that doesn't matter in what
dimension space we are.",00:01:42.310,00:01:45.430
"This could be R100
this could be R2.",00:01:45.430,00:01:47.670
"For it to have a unit vector in
any of those spaces, their",00:01:47.670,00:01:50.710
length is 1.,00:01:50.710,00:01:52.070
"The next obvious question
is, how do you",00:01:52.070,00:01:53.810
construct a unit vector?,00:01:53.810,00:01:56.710
"Let's say that I have
some vector, v.",00:01:56.710,00:02:00.300
"And let's say it's not
a unit vector.",00:02:00.300,00:02:02.030
It's v1 v2 all the way to vn.,00:02:02.030,00:02:06.050
"And I want to turn it into some
vector u that is a unit",00:02:06.050,00:02:10.360
"vector, that just goes in
the same direction.",00:02:10.360,00:02:13.020
"So u will go in the same
direction, as v, but the",00:02:13.020,00:02:24.520
"length of u is going
to be equal to 1.",00:02:24.520,00:02:28.130
"How do I construct this
vector u here?",00:02:28.130,00:02:31.710
"What I could do is, I could
take the length of v.",00:02:31.710,00:02:35.450
"I could find out what the length
of v is, and we know",00:02:35.450,00:02:37.680
how to do that.,00:02:37.680,00:02:38.270
"We just apply this definition
of vector length.",00:02:38.270,00:02:42.000
"And what happens if I figure out
the length of v, and then",00:02:42.000,00:02:44.130
"I multiply the vector
v times that?",00:02:44.130,00:02:47.610
"What if I make my u, what if I
say u is equal to, 1 over the",00:02:47.610,00:02:53.720
length of v times v itself?,00:02:53.720,00:03:00.210
What happens here?,00:03:00.210,00:03:02.160
"If I take the length
of this thing right",00:03:02.160,00:03:04.350
"here, what do I get?",00:03:04.350,00:03:10.970
"The length of u is equal to
the length of this scalar.",00:03:10.970,00:03:18.580
"Remember this is just
some number, right?",00:03:18.580,00:03:20.740
"It's equal to this scalar,
and I'm assuming v",00:03:20.740,00:03:24.070
is a non-zero vector.,00:03:24.070,00:03:27.210
"The length of whatever this
scalar number is times v.",00:03:27.210,00:03:33.130
"And we know that we can take
this scalar out of the",00:03:33.130,00:03:35.870
"formula, we can show that --
I think I've shown it in a",00:03:35.870,00:03:37.860
"previous video -- that the
length of c times v is equal",00:03:37.860,00:03:41.730
to c times the length of v.,00:03:41.730,00:03:43.300
Let me write that down.,00:03:43.300,00:03:44.630
"And that's essentially what
I'm assuming right here.",00:03:44.630,00:03:46.520
"That if I take the length of c
times some vector, v, that is",00:03:46.520,00:03:50.030
"equal to c times the
length of v.",00:03:50.030,00:03:52.990
"I think we showed this when we
first were introduced to the",00:03:52.990,00:03:55.970
idea of length.,00:03:55.970,00:03:56.940
"So we know that this is going
to be equal to 1 over the",00:03:56.940,00:04:01.390
"length of vector v -- that's my
c -- times, so this thing",00:04:01.390,00:04:05.360
"right here is that thing right
there, times this thing, times",00:04:05.360,00:04:11.270
the length of vector v.,00:04:11.270,00:04:13.710
"Well what's this going
to be equal to?",00:04:13.710,00:04:15.000
"1 over something times
that something.",00:04:15.000,00:04:16.800
"Well this is just going
to be equal to 1.",00:04:16.800,00:04:19.360
"So that's all a unit
vector is.",00:04:19.360,00:04:20.790
"If you want to find a unit
vector -- or sometimes it's",00:04:20.790,00:04:23.180
"called a normalized vector
-- that goes in the same",00:04:23.180,00:04:32.150
"direction as some vector v, you
just figure out the length",00:04:32.150,00:04:34.600
"of v using the definition
of vector length in Rn.",00:04:34.600,00:04:38.600
"And then multiply 1 over that
length times the vector v --",00:04:38.600,00:04:42.370
"and this is just a scalar
-- and then you",00:04:42.370,00:04:44.220
get your vector u.,00:04:44.220,00:04:45.800
"Let me to do an example, just to
make sure you get the idea.",00:04:45.800,00:04:48.860
"Let's say I have some vector
v and it's in R3.",00:04:55.860,00:05:00.970
"Let's say it's 1, 2, minus 1.",00:05:00.970,00:05:05.380
What is the length of v?,00:05:05.380,00:05:07.900
"The length of v is equal to the
square root of 1 squared",00:05:07.900,00:05:14.000
"plus 2 squared plus minus 1
squared, and that is equal to",00:05:14.000,00:05:20.490
"the square root of 1 plus 1 plus
4 -- square root of 6.",00:05:20.490,00:05:27.070
So that is the length of v.,00:05:27.070,00:05:29.540
"If I want to construct a
normalized vector u that goes",00:05:29.540,00:05:32.800
"in the same direction as v, I
can just define my vector u as",00:05:32.800,00:05:37.130
"being equal to 1 over the length
of v -- 1 over the",00:05:37.130,00:05:41.160
square root of 6 -- times v.,00:05:41.160,00:05:44.130
"So times 1, 2, minus 1.",00:05:44.130,00:05:47.460
"Which is equal to 1 over square
root of 6, 2 over",00:05:47.460,00:05:53.020
"square root of 6, and minus 1
over the square root of 6.",00:05:53.020,00:05:57.620
"And I'll leave it for you to
verify that the length of u is",00:05:57.620,00:06:00.970
going to be equal to 1.,00:06:00.970,00:06:02.570
"I'll just throw out one
other idea here that",00:06:02.570,00:06:04.420
you'll often see.,00:06:04.420,00:06:05.620
"When something is a unit vector,
instead of using this",00:06:05.620,00:06:08.270
"little arrow on top of the
vector, they'll often write a",00:06:08.270,00:06:11.280
"unit vector with a little hat
on top of it, like that.",00:06:11.280,00:06:14.210
"That signifies that we're
dealing with a unit vector.",00:06:14.210,00:06:18.010
"And for those of you've taken
your vector calculus, or have",00:06:18.010,00:06:20.990
"done a little bit of
engineering, you're probably",00:06:20.990,00:06:22.490
"familiar with the vectors
i, j, and k.",00:06:22.490,00:06:28.100
"And the reason why they have
this little hat here is",00:06:28.100,00:06:30.450
"because these are all
unit vectors in R3.",00:06:30.450,00:06:34.060
"They're members of R3 and
they're all unit vectors.",00:06:34.060,00:06:37.480
"These are actually the
basis vectors in R3.",00:06:37.480,00:06:39.720
"And for those of you who
have been watching my",00:06:39.720,00:06:41.410
"transformation videos, these are
equivalent to the vectors",00:06:41.410,00:06:44.940
"e1 -- which I could write
with a hat on it,",00:06:44.940,00:06:46.850
"really -- e2, and e3.",00:06:46.850,00:06:49.320
"Which are the standard
basis vectors in R3.",00:06:49.320,00:06:52.570
"Now that you've been exposed to
it, now I can start to use",00:06:52.570,00:06:54.930
"the idea of a unit vector
in future videos.",00:06:54.930,00:06:58.150
