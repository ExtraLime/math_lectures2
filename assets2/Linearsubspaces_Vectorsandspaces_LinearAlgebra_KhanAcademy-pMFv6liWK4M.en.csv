"We now have the tools, I think,
to understand the idea",00:00:00.480,00:00:04.820
of a linear subspace of Rn.,00:00:04.820,00:00:07.680
Let me write that down.,00:00:07.680,00:00:10.900
"I'll just always call
it a subspace of Rn.",00:00:10.900,00:00:13.130
"Everything we're doing
is linear.",00:00:13.130,00:00:14.630
Subspace of Rn.,00:00:14.630,00:00:20.090
"I'm going to make a
definition here.",00:00:20.090,00:00:21.710
"I'm going to say that
a set of vectors V.",00:00:21.710,00:00:24.450
"So V is some subset of vectors,
some subset of Rn.",00:00:24.450,00:00:32.410
"So we already said Rn, when we
think about it, it's really",00:00:35.020,00:00:37.430
"just really an infinitely large
set of vectors, where",00:00:37.430,00:00:42.010
"each of those vectors
have n components.",00:00:42.010,00:00:46.390
"I'm going to not formally define
it, but this is just a",00:00:46.390,00:00:48.620
set of vectors.,00:00:48.620,00:00:49.460
"I mean sometimes we visualize it
as multi-dimensional space",00:00:49.460,00:00:52.240
"and all that, but if we wanted
to be just as abstract about",00:00:52.240,00:00:55.290
"it as possible, it's
just all the set.",00:00:55.290,00:00:57.770
"It's the set of all of the --
you know we could call x1, x2,",00:00:57.770,00:01:02.400
"all the way to xn-- where each
of these, where each of the",00:01:02.400,00:01:07.920
"xi's are a member of the real
numbers for all of the i's.",00:01:07.920,00:01:14.250
Right?,00:01:14.250,00:01:14.470
That was our definition of Rn.,00:01:14.470,00:01:16.410
"It's just a huge
set of vectors.",00:01:16.410,00:01:18.880
"An infinitely large
set of vectors.",00:01:18.880,00:01:20.880
"V, I'm calling that, I'm going
to call that a subset of Rn,",00:01:20.880,00:01:25.040
"and which means it's just some
-- you know, it could be all",00:01:25.040,00:01:28.590
"of these vectors, and I'll talk
about that in a second.",00:01:28.590,00:01:30.550
"Or it could be some subset
of these vectors.",00:01:30.550,00:01:33.140
"Maybe it's all of them but
one particular vector.",00:01:33.140,00:01:36.040
"In order for this V to be a
subspace-- so I'm already",00:01:36.040,00:01:41.090
saying it's a subset of Rn.,00:01:41.090,00:01:44.280
Maybe this'll help you.,00:01:44.280,00:01:45.240
"If I draw all of Rn here
as this big blob.",00:01:45.240,00:01:48.300
"So these are all of the vectors
that are in Rn.",00:01:48.300,00:01:52.760
V is some subset of it.,00:01:52.760,00:01:54.390
It could be all of Rn.,00:01:54.390,00:01:55.220
I'll show that a second.,00:01:55.220,00:01:56.385
"But let's just say
that this is V.",00:01:56.385,00:01:59.950
V is a subset of vectors.,00:01:59.950,00:02:01.470
"Now in order for V to be a
subspace, and this is a",00:02:04.970,00:02:07.500
"definition, if V is a subspace,
or linear subspace",00:02:07.500,00:02:16.140
"of Rn, this means, this
is my definition,",00:02:16.140,00:02:23.210
this means three things.,00:02:23.210,00:02:25.270
"This means that V contains
the 0 vector.",00:02:25.270,00:02:28.605
"I'll do it really, that's
the 0 vector.",00:02:31.970,00:02:36.530
"This is equal to 0 all the
way and you have n 0's.",00:02:36.530,00:02:40.620
"So V contains the 0 vector,
and this is",00:02:40.620,00:02:42.960
a big V right there.,00:02:42.960,00:02:45.660
If we have some vector x in V.,00:02:45.660,00:02:48.820
"So let me write this, if my
vector x is in V, if x is one",00:02:48.820,00:02:57.470
"of these vectors that's included
in my V, then when I",00:02:57.470,00:03:00.870
"multiply x times any member
of the reals.",00:03:00.870,00:03:04.270
"So if x is in V, then if V is a
subspace of Rn, then x times",00:03:04.270,00:03:10.470
any scalar is also in V.,00:03:10.470,00:03:16.290
This has to be the case.,00:03:16.290,00:03:18.360
"For those of you who are
familiar with the term, this",00:03:18.360,00:03:20.410
term is called closure.,00:03:20.410,00:03:21.900
"If I have any element of a set,
this is closure under",00:03:21.900,00:03:25.700
multiplication.,00:03:25.700,00:03:26.520
"Let me write that down--
in a new color.",00:03:26.520,00:03:29.180
"This is closure under scalar
multiplication.",00:03:29.180,00:03:36.283
"And that's just a fancy way of
saying, look, if I take some",00:03:40.720,00:03:44.720
"member of my set and I multiply
it by some scalar,",00:03:44.720,00:03:52.860
"I'm still going to
be in my set.",00:03:52.860,00:03:55.840
"If I multiplied it by some
scalar and I end up outside of",00:03:55.840,00:03:58.500
"my set, if I ended up with some
other vector that's not",00:03:58.500,00:04:02.940
"included in my subset, then this
wouldn't be a subspace.",00:04:02.940,00:04:06.080
"In order for it to be a
subspace, if I multiply any",00:04:06.080,00:04:10.020
"vector in my subset by a real
scalar, I'm defining this",00:04:10.020,00:04:15.940
"subspace over real numbers, if
I multiply it by any real",00:04:15.940,00:04:19.570
"number, I should also get
another member of this subset.",00:04:19.570,00:04:24.130
"So this is one of the
requirements.",00:04:24.130,00:04:25.880
"And then the other requirement
is if I take two vectors,",00:04:25.880,00:04:31.170
"let's say I have vector a,
it's in here, and I have",00:04:31.170,00:04:33.410
vector b in here.,00:04:33.410,00:04:36.360
So this is my other requirement,00:04:36.360,00:04:38.320
for v being a subspace.,00:04:38.320,00:04:39.710
"If a is in a-- sorry-- if vector
a is in my set V, and",00:04:39.710,00:04:44.430
"vector b is in my set V, then if
V is a subspace of Rn, that",00:04:44.430,00:04:51.100
"tells me that a and b must
be in V as well.",00:04:51.100,00:04:58.470
"So this is closure
under addition.",00:04:58.470,00:05:02.120
Let me write that down.,00:05:02.120,00:05:03.840
Closure under addition.,00:05:03.840,00:05:08.910
"Once again, just a very fancy
way of saying, look, if you",00:05:08.910,00:05:12.430
"give me two elements that's in
my subset, and if I add them",00:05:12.430,00:05:17.040
"to each other -- these could be
any two arbitrary elements",00:05:17.040,00:05:19.740
"in my subset -- and I add them
to each other, I'm going to",00:05:19.740,00:05:21.990
"get another element
in my subset.",00:05:21.990,00:05:23.980
"That's what closure under
addition means.",00:05:23.980,00:05:26.320
"That when you add two vectors in
your set, you still end up",00:05:26.320,00:05:29.330
"with another vector
in your set.",00:05:29.330,00:05:30.660
"You don't somehow end up
with a vector that's",00:05:30.660,00:05:32.540
outside of your set.,00:05:32.540,00:05:35.380
"If I have a subset of Rn, so
some subset of vectors of Rn,",00:05:35.380,00:05:39.910
"that contains the 0 vector,
and it's closed under",00:05:39.910,00:05:45.060
"multiplication and addition,
then I have a subspace.",00:05:45.060,00:05:48.930
"So subspace implies all of these
things, and all of these",00:05:48.930,00:05:51.870
things imply a subspace.,00:05:51.870,00:05:54.540
"This is the definition
of a subspace.",00:05:54.540,00:05:57.600
"This might seem all abstract to
you right now, so let's do",00:05:57.600,00:06:00.870
a couple of examples.,00:06:00.870,00:06:01.860
"And I don't know if these
examples will make it any more",00:06:01.860,00:06:04.650
"concrete, but I think if we do
it enough, you'll kind of get",00:06:04.650,00:06:06.860
"the intuitive sense of
what a space implies.",00:06:06.860,00:06:09.810
Let me just do some examples.,00:06:12.550,00:06:13.740
"Because I want to
stay relatively",00:06:13.740,00:06:15.370
mathematically formal.,00:06:15.370,00:06:17.470
"Let's just say I have the almost
trivially basic set.",00:06:17.470,00:06:21.210
"Let's say my set of vectors, I
only have one vector in it and",00:06:21.210,00:06:25.760
I have the 0 vector.,00:06:25.760,00:06:27.470
"So I'll just do a really
bold 0 there.",00:06:27.470,00:06:29.670
"Or I could write it like this,
the only vector in my set is",00:06:29.670,00:06:33.335
the 0 vector.,00:06:33.335,00:06:35.410
Now Let's say?,00:06:35.410,00:06:35.830
We're talking about R3.,00:06:35.830,00:06:37.830
"So let's say my 0 vector
in R3 looks like that.",00:06:37.830,00:06:41.860
"What I want to know is, is my
set V a subspace of R3?",00:06:41.860,00:06:53.710
"Well, in order for it to be a
subspace, three conditions.",00:06:53.710,00:06:56.670
"It has to contain
the 0 vector.",00:06:56.670,00:06:59.030
"Well the only thing it does
contain is the 0 vector.",00:06:59.030,00:07:01.110
"So it definitely contains
the 0 vector.",00:07:01.110,00:07:03.430
"So 0 vector, check.",00:07:03.430,00:07:06.830
"Now, is it closed under
multiplication?",00:07:06.830,00:07:09.980
"So that means, if I take any
member of the set, there's",00:07:09.980,00:07:12.650
"only one of them, and I multiply
it by any scalar, I",00:07:12.650,00:07:15.810
"should get another member
of the set.",00:07:15.810,00:07:17.440
Or I should get maybe itself.,00:07:17.440,00:07:18.820
"So let's see, there's only
one member of the set.",00:07:18.820,00:07:21.640
"So the one member of the
set is the 0 vector.",00:07:21.640,00:07:24.670
"If I multiply it times
any scalar, what",00:07:24.670,00:07:26.810
am I going to get?,00:07:26.810,00:07:27.370
"I'm going to get c times 0 which
is 0, c times 0, which",00:07:27.370,00:07:31.120
"is 0, and c times 0.",00:07:31.120,00:07:33.610
"I'm going to get its
only member.",00:07:33.610,00:07:35.280
But it is closed.,00:07:35.280,00:07:36.250
"So it is closed under
multiplication.",00:07:36.250,00:07:42.140
"You can multiply this one vector
times any scalar, and",00:07:42.140,00:07:45.720
"you're just going to get
this vector again.",00:07:45.720,00:07:47.750
"So you're going to end up being
in your 0 vector set.",00:07:47.750,00:07:52.840
That's a check.,00:07:52.840,00:07:54.010
Is it closed under addition?,00:07:54.010,00:07:56.000
"Well, clearly if I add any
member of this set to itself,",00:07:56.000,00:08:00.660
"I mean, there's only one
member, to another",00:08:00.660,00:08:02.260
member of the set.,00:08:02.260,00:08:03.070
There's only one option here.,00:08:03.070,00:08:04.650
"If I just add that to
that, what do I get?",00:08:04.650,00:08:07.990
I just get that.,00:08:07.990,00:08:09.430
I just get it again.,00:08:09.430,00:08:10.750
"So it definitely is closed
under addition.",00:08:10.750,00:08:18.550
Check.,00:08:18.550,00:08:19.270
"So it does turn out that this
trivially basic subset of r3,",00:08:19.270,00:08:23.980
"that just contains the 0 vector,
it is a subspace.",00:08:23.980,00:08:29.520
"Maybe a trivially simple
subspace, but it satisfies our",00:08:29.520,00:08:33.860
constraints of a subspace.,00:08:33.860,00:08:35.140
"You can't do anything with the
vectors in it, they'll somehow",00:08:35.140,00:08:37.750
get you out of that subspace.,00:08:37.750,00:08:39.230
"Or at least if you're
dealing with scalar",00:08:39.230,00:08:40.640
multiplication or addition.,00:08:40.640,00:08:42.549
"Let me do one that maybe the
idea will be a little clearer",00:08:42.549,00:08:45.450
"if I show you an example
of something",00:08:45.450,00:08:47.340
that is not a subspace.,00:08:47.340,00:08:49.700
"Let me get my coordinate
axes is over here.",00:08:49.700,00:08:52.660
"Let's say I were to find some
subspace, some subset.",00:08:52.660,00:08:58.880
"I don't know whether
it's a subspace.",00:08:58.880,00:09:00.170
Let me call it my set S.,00:09:00.170,00:09:03.830
"And it equals all the vectors
x1, x2 that are a member of R2",00:09:03.830,00:09:19.010
"such that, I'm going to make a
little constraint here, such",00:09:19.010,00:09:22.330
"that x1 is greater than
or equal to 0.",00:09:22.330,00:09:30.670
"It contains all of the vectors
in R2 that are at least is 0",00:09:30.670,00:09:35.160
or greater for the first term.,00:09:35.160,00:09:36.960
"So if we were to graph that
here, what do you get?",00:09:36.960,00:09:39.850
We can get anything.,00:09:39.850,00:09:40.780
"We can move up or down
in any direction.",00:09:40.780,00:09:43.510
Right?,00:09:43.510,00:09:45.110
"We can go up and down in any
direction, but we're",00:09:45.110,00:09:47.530
constraining ourselves.,00:09:47.530,00:09:48.330
"These are all going to
be 0 or greater.",00:09:48.330,00:09:50.520
"So all of these first
coordinates are going to be 0",00:09:50.520,00:09:53.530
or greater.,00:09:53.530,00:09:55.530
"And this one, we can go up
and down arbitrarily.",00:09:55.530,00:09:57.950
"So we're essentially, this
subset of R2, R2 is my entire",00:09:57.950,00:10:04.390
Cartesian plane.,00:10:04.390,00:10:06.020
"But this subset of R2 will
include the vertical axis,",00:10:06.020,00:10:10.690
"often referred to
as the y-axis.",00:10:10.690,00:10:12.125
"It will include the vertical
axis, and essentially the",00:10:12.125,00:10:14.950
first and fourth quadrants.,00:10:14.950,00:10:16.175
"If you remember your
quadrant labelling.",00:10:16.175,00:10:18.210
"So that's the first
quadrant and",00:10:18.210,00:10:19.920
that's the fourth quadrant.,00:10:19.920,00:10:21.890
"So my question to you is,
is S a subspace of R2.",00:10:21.890,00:10:33.810
"So the first question, does
it contain the 0 vector?",00:10:33.810,00:10:37.080
"So in the case of R2, does
it contain 0, 0?",00:10:37.080,00:10:43.870
"Well, sure.",00:10:43.870,00:10:44.395
"It includes 0, 0 right there.",00:10:44.395,00:10:48.790
"We said x is greater than or
equal to 0, so this could be 0",00:10:48.790,00:10:52.610
"and obviously, there's no
constraint on this, so",00:10:52.610,00:10:54.190
"definitely the 0, 0 vector
is definitely",00:10:54.190,00:10:56.290
contained in our set S.,00:10:56.290,00:10:58.870
So that is a check.,00:10:58.870,00:11:02.410
Let's try another one.,00:11:02.410,00:11:03.840
"If I add any two vectors in this
set, is that also going",00:11:03.840,00:11:09.520
to show up in my set?,00:11:09.520,00:11:10.820
"Let me just do a couple
of examples.",00:11:10.820,00:11:12.270
Maybe this isn't a proof.,00:11:12.270,00:11:14.230
"If I add that vector to
that vector, what",00:11:14.230,00:11:17.860
am I going to get?,00:11:17.860,00:11:18.690
"If I put this up here, I'm
going to get that vector.",00:11:18.690,00:11:21.730
"If I add that vector to
that vector, what",00:11:21.730,00:11:26.660
am I going to get?,00:11:26.660,00:11:27.330
"I could put this one heads to
tails, I would get a vector",00:11:27.330,00:11:29.530
that looks like that.,00:11:29.530,00:11:34.140
"And if I did it formally, if I
add -- let's say that I have",00:11:34.140,00:11:39.200
"two vectors that are a
member of our set.",00:11:39.200,00:11:41.550
"Let's say the first one is
a, b and I add it to c,",00:11:41.550,00:11:45.503
"d, what do I get?",00:11:45.503,00:11:48.570
"I get a plus c over -- this
was a d -- over b plus d.",00:11:48.570,00:11:55.400
"So this thing is going
to be greater than 0.",00:11:55.400,00:11:58.100
"This thing is also going
to be greater than 0.",00:11:58.100,00:12:00.120
"That was my requirement
for being in the set.",00:12:00.120,00:12:02.550
"So if both of these are greater
than 0 and we add them",00:12:02.550,00:12:05.060
"to each other, this thing
is also going to be",00:12:05.060,00:12:07.190
greater than 0.,00:12:07.190,00:12:08.200
"And we don't care what these,
these can be anything, I",00:12:08.200,00:12:10.190
"didn't put any constraints
on the second",00:12:10.190,00:12:13.320
component of my vector.,00:12:13.320,00:12:14.830
"So it does seem like it is
closed under addition.",00:12:14.830,00:12:17.410
"Now what about scalar
multiplication?",00:12:22.880,00:12:26.790
"Let's take a particular
case here.",00:12:26.790,00:12:30.620
"Let's take my a, b again.",00:12:30.620,00:12:34.170
"I have my vector a, b.",00:12:34.170,00:12:37.070
"Now I can pick any
real scalar.",00:12:37.070,00:12:40.340
So any real scalar.,00:12:40.340,00:12:41.400
"What if I just multiply
it by minus 1?",00:12:41.400,00:12:43.830
So minus 1.,00:12:43.830,00:12:45.440
"So if I multiply it by minus
1, I get minus a, minus b.",00:12:45.440,00:12:51.140
"If I were to draw it visually,
if this is-- let's say a, b",00:12:51.140,00:12:54.880
"was the vector 2, 4.",00:12:54.880,00:12:56.235
So it's like this.,00:12:56.235,00:12:59.500
"When I multiply it by minus
1, what do I get?",00:12:59.500,00:13:01.910
"I get minus a, minus b.",00:13:01.910,00:13:04.650
I get this vector.,00:13:04.650,00:13:06.580
"Which you can be visually
clearly see falls out of, if",00:13:06.580,00:13:11.300
"we view these as kind of
position vectors, it falls out",00:13:11.300,00:13:14.540
of our subspace.,00:13:14.540,00:13:16.040
"Or if you just view it not even
visually, if you just do",00:13:16.040,00:13:18.500
"it mathematically, clearly if
this is positive then this is",00:13:18.500,00:13:23.070
"going to-- and let's say if we
assume this is positive, and",00:13:23.070,00:13:25.040
definitely not 0.,00:13:25.040,00:13:26.250
"So it's definitely a
positive number.",00:13:26.250,00:13:27.610
"So this is definitely going
to be a negative number.",00:13:27.610,00:13:30.300
"So when we multiply it by
negative 1, for really any",00:13:30.300,00:13:34.000
"element of this that doesn't
have a 0 there, you're going",00:13:34.000,00:13:36.635
"to end up with something that
falls out of it, right?",00:13:36.635,00:13:39.460
"This is not a member of this
set, because to be a member of",00:13:39.460,00:13:43.460
"the set, your first component
had to be greater than 0.",00:13:43.460,00:13:46.270
"This first component
is less than 0.",00:13:46.270,00:13:48.530
"So this subset that I drew out
here, the subset of R2, is not",00:13:48.530,00:13:54.040
"a subspace, Because?",00:13:54.040,00:13:54.920
"It's not closed under
multiplication or scalar",00:13:54.920,00:13:57.650
multiplication.,00:13:57.650,00:13:58.900
This is not a sub space of R2.,00:14:08.330,00:14:17.910
"Now I'll ask you one interesting
question.",00:14:17.910,00:14:20.560
"What if I ask you just the span
of some set of vectors?",00:14:20.560,00:14:25.570
"Let's say I want to know the
span of, I don't know, let's",00:14:25.570,00:14:34.980
"sat I have vector
v1, v2, and v3.",00:14:34.980,00:14:40.390
"I'm not even going to tell you
how many elements each of",00:14:40.390,00:14:42.660
"these vectors have. Is this
a valid subspace of Rn?",00:14:42.660,00:14:52.590
"Where n is the number of
elements that each of these",00:14:52.590,00:14:55.150
have.,00:14:55.150,00:14:58.500
"Let's pick one of
the elements.",00:14:58.500,00:15:02.320
"Let me define, let me just call
u to be the set-- the set",00:15:02.320,00:15:09.610
"of all linear combinations
of this is the span.",00:15:09.610,00:15:12.030
"So let me just define
u to be the span.",00:15:12.030,00:15:13.740
"So I want to know, is
u a valid subspace?",00:15:13.740,00:15:17.830
"So let's think about
it this way.",00:15:17.830,00:15:18.890
"Let me just pick out a
random element of u.",00:15:18.890,00:15:22.630
"Actually, does this contain
the 0 vector?",00:15:25.660,00:15:29.090
"Well, sure.",00:15:29.090,00:15:29.590
"If we just multiply all of these
times 0, if we just say",00:15:29.590,00:15:32.950
"0 times v1, plus 0 times v2,
these are all the vectors, I",00:15:32.950,00:15:37.530
"didn't write them bold, plus
0 times v3, we get",00:15:37.530,00:15:41.480
"the 0 vector, right?",00:15:41.480,00:15:43.390
"We did everything
just zeroed out.",00:15:43.390,00:15:44.790
"So it definitely contains
the 0 vector.",00:15:44.790,00:15:46.720
"This is a linear combination
of those three vectors, so",00:15:46.720,00:15:49.685
it's included in the span.,00:15:49.685,00:15:52.120
"Now let me just pick some
arbitrary member of this span.",00:15:52.120,00:15:58.740
"So in order to be a member of
this set, it just means that",00:15:58.740,00:16:02.650
"you can be represented-- let me
just call it the vector x--",00:16:02.650,00:16:05.550
"it means that you can be
represented as a linear",00:16:05.550,00:16:07.500
combination of these vectors.,00:16:07.500,00:16:09.040
"So some combination, c1 times
v1 plus c2 times v2",00:16:09.040,00:16:16.420
plus c3 times v3.,00:16:16.420,00:16:19.145
Right?,00:16:19.145,00:16:19.940
"I'm just representing this
vector x, it's a member of",00:16:19.940,00:16:21.900
"this, so it can be represented
as a linear combination of",00:16:21.900,00:16:23.880
those three vectors.,00:16:23.880,00:16:26.030
"Is this set closed under
multiplication?",00:16:26.030,00:16:29.570
"Well let's just multiply this
times some arbitrary constant.",00:16:29.570,00:16:32.850
What is c times x?,00:16:32.850,00:16:34.980
"Let me scroll down
a little bit.",00:16:34.980,00:16:37.240
What does c times x equal?,00:16:37.240,00:16:39.600
"Let me do a different
constant actually.",00:16:39.600,00:16:42.370
"Let me multiply it times some
arbitrary constant a.",00:16:42.370,00:16:45.400
What is a times x?,00:16:45.400,00:16:47.810
"What's a times c1 times v1--
I'm just multiplying both",00:16:47.810,00:16:52.200
"sides equation times a--
a times c2 times v2",00:16:52.200,00:16:56.300
"plus a times c3, v3.",00:16:56.300,00:17:00.710
Right?,00:17:00.710,00:17:03.280
"If this was an arbitrary
constant, you could just write",00:17:03.280,00:17:05.109
"this as another arbitrary
constant.",00:17:05.109,00:17:06.520
"This is another arbitrary
constant.",00:17:06.520,00:17:08.050
"This is another arbitrary
constant.",00:17:08.050,00:17:09.869
I want to be clear.,00:17:09.869,00:17:10.290
"All I did is I just multiplied
both sides of the equation",00:17:10.290,00:17:12.520
times a scalar.,00:17:12.520,00:17:13.640
"But clearly, this expression
right here, I mean I could",00:17:13.640,00:17:17.410
"write this, I could rewrite this
as c4 times v1 plus c5",00:17:17.410,00:17:23.040
"times v2, where this
is c5, this is c4.",00:17:23.040,00:17:26.150
Plus c6 times v3.,00:17:26.150,00:17:28.890
"This is clearly another
linear combination",00:17:28.890,00:17:31.410
of these three vectors.,00:17:31.410,00:17:33.320
"So, the span is the set of all
of the linear combinations of",00:17:33.320,00:17:36.300
these three vectors.,00:17:36.300,00:17:37.370
"So clearly this is one of the
linear combinations, so it's",00:17:37.370,00:17:40.100
also included in the span.,00:17:40.100,00:17:42.080
So this is also in u.,00:17:42.080,00:17:44.980
"It's also in the span of
those three vectors.",00:17:44.980,00:17:47.620
"So it is closed under
multiplication.",00:17:47.620,00:17:51.410
"Now we just have to show that
it's closed under addition,",00:17:55.130,00:17:57.160
"and then we know that the span
of -- and I did three, here",00:17:57.160,00:18:00.540
"but you can extend an arbitrary
n number of vectors",00:18:00.540,00:18:03.600
"if the span of any set of
vectors is a valid subspace.",00:18:03.600,00:18:08.620
Let me prove that.,00:18:08.620,00:18:10.930
We already defined one x here.,00:18:10.930,00:18:12.410
"Let me define another vector
that's in u, or that's in the",00:18:12.410,00:18:16.140
span of these vectors.,00:18:16.140,00:18:17.640
"And it equals, I don't know,
let's say it equals d1 times",00:18:17.640,00:18:21.780
"v1 plus d2 times v2
plus d3 times v3.",00:18:21.780,00:18:29.120
Now what is x plus y?,00:18:29.120,00:18:35.900
"If I add these two vectors,
what does it equal to?",00:18:35.900,00:18:39.090
"Well, I could just add.",00:18:39.090,00:18:41.550
"x plus y means all of this stuff
plus all of this stuff.",00:18:41.550,00:18:45.570
So what does that equal?,00:18:45.570,00:18:46.620
"It means if you just add these
together you get c1 plus d1",00:18:46.620,00:18:52.020
"times v1 plus c2 plus d2 times
v2 plus c3 plus d3 times v3.",00:18:52.020,00:19:04.020
Right?,00:19:04.020,00:19:04.930
"You had a v3 here, you had a
v3 there, you just add up",00:19:04.930,00:19:08.260
their coefficients.,00:19:08.260,00:19:09.480
"Clearly this is just another
linear combination.",00:19:09.480,00:19:11.930
"These are just constants
again.",00:19:11.930,00:19:13.600
"That's an arbitrary constant,
that's an arbitrary constant,",00:19:13.600,00:19:15.960
that's an arbitrary constant.,00:19:15.960,00:19:17.420
"So this thing is just a linear
combination of v1, v2, and v3.",00:19:17.420,00:19:22.660
"So it must be, by definition, in
the span of v1, v2, and v3.",00:19:22.660,00:19:27.880
"So we are definitely closed
under addition.",00:19:27.880,00:19:36.340
"Now, you might say, hey, Sal,
you're saying that the span of",00:19:36.340,00:19:38.400
"any vector is a valid subspace,
but let me show you",00:19:38.400,00:19:43.500
"an example that clearly, if I
just took the span of one",00:19:43.500,00:19:47.440
"vector, let me just define u
to be equal to the span of",00:19:47.440,00:19:52.900
"just the vector, let me just
do a really simple one.",00:19:52.900,00:19:56.250
"Just the vector 1, 1.",00:19:56.250,00:19:58.500
"Clearly this can't be
a valid subspace.",00:19:58.500,00:20:01.550
"Let's think about
this visually.",00:20:01.550,00:20:03.540
"What does vector
1, 1 look like?",00:20:03.540,00:20:06.190
"Vector 1, 1 looks like this.",00:20:06.190,00:20:08.622
Right?,00:20:08.622,00:20:09.680
"And the span of vector 1, 1--
this is in its standard",00:20:09.680,00:20:13.260
"position -- the span of vector
1, 1 is all of the linear",00:20:13.260,00:20:16.300
combinations of this vector.,00:20:16.300,00:20:18.040
"Well, there's nothing else to
add it to, so it's really just",00:20:18.040,00:20:19.880
"going to be all of the
scaled up and scaled",00:20:19.880,00:20:21.710
down versions of this.,00:20:21.710,00:20:23.050
"So if you scale it up
you get things that",00:20:23.050,00:20:25.020
look more like that.,00:20:25.020,00:20:26.900
"If you scale it down, you get
things that look more like",00:20:26.900,00:20:28.970
"that if you go into the
negative domain.",00:20:28.970,00:20:31.250
"So just by multiplying this
vector times different values,",00:20:31.250,00:20:35.060
"and if you're going to put
them all into a standard",00:20:35.060,00:20:37.370
"position, you'd essentially
get a line",00:20:37.370,00:20:40.240
that looks like that.,00:20:40.240,00:20:41.880
"You say, gee, that doesn't look
like a whole subspace.",00:20:41.880,00:20:45.070
But a couple of things.,00:20:45.070,00:20:46.180
"Clearly, it contains
the 0 vector.",00:20:46.180,00:20:49.800
We can just scale it by 0.,00:20:52.670,00:20:56.060
"The span is just all of the
different scales of this.",00:20:56.060,00:20:58.180
"And if there are other vectors,
you would add it to",00:20:58.180,00:20:59.820
those as well.,00:20:59.820,00:21:00.480
"But this is clearly going
to be the 0 vector.",00:21:00.480,00:21:02.750
So it contains the 0 vector.,00:21:02.750,00:21:05.580
"Is it closed under
multiplication?",00:21:05.580,00:21:07.980
"Well, the span is the set of all
the vectors, where, if you",00:21:07.980,00:21:12.120
"take all of the real numbers
for c and you multiply it",00:21:12.120,00:21:15.230
"times 1, 1, that is the span.",00:21:15.230,00:21:17.920
"Clearly, you multiply this times
anything it's going to",00:21:17.920,00:21:20.130
"equal another thing that's
definitely in your span.",00:21:20.130,00:21:24.590
"The last thing, is it closed
under addition?",00:21:24.590,00:21:26.540
"So any two vectors in the span
could, let's say that I have",00:21:29.270,00:21:33.190
"one vector a that's
in my span.",00:21:33.190,00:21:35.690
"I can represent it as c1 some
scalar times my vector there.",00:21:35.690,00:21:43.660
"And then I have another vector
b, and I could represent it",00:21:43.660,00:21:47.305
"with c2 times my one vector
in my set right there.",00:21:47.305,00:21:52.690
"And so what is this going
to be equal to?",00:21:52.690,00:21:54.020
"This is going to be equal to,
this is essentially going to",00:21:54.020,00:21:57.390
"be equal to c-- well, get a
little more space-- this is",00:21:57.390,00:22:01.550
"going to be equal to c1 plus
c2 times my vector.",00:22:01.550,00:22:07.030
"This is almost trivially
obvious.",00:22:07.030,00:22:09.150
"But clearly this
is in the span.",00:22:09.150,00:22:11.080
"It's just a scaled up
version of this.",00:22:11.080,00:22:12.820
"This is in the span, it's in a
scaled up version of this.",00:22:12.820,00:22:15.260
"And this is also going to be
in the span of this vector,",00:22:15.260,00:22:18.370
"because this is just
another scalar.",00:22:18.370,00:22:20.190
We could call that c3.,00:22:20.190,00:22:22.380
"If you just do it visually, if I
take this vector right there",00:22:22.380,00:22:28.110
"and I were to add it to this
vector, if you put them head",00:22:28.110,00:22:33.700
"to tails, you would end
up with this vector.",00:22:33.700,00:22:38.080
Right there in green.,00:22:38.080,00:22:39.200
"I don't know if you
can see it.",00:22:39.200,00:22:40.200
I'll do it in red right there.,00:22:40.200,00:22:42.410
You end up with that vector.,00:22:42.410,00:22:44.720
"And you could do that any vector
plus any other vector",00:22:44.720,00:22:47.160
"on this line is going to equal
another vector on this line.",00:22:47.160,00:22:50.020
"Any vector on this line
multiplied by some scalar is",00:22:50.020,00:22:52.585
"just going to be another
vector on this line.",00:22:52.585,00:22:55.130
"So you're closed under
multiplication.",00:22:55.130,00:22:58.280
Your closed under addition.,00:22:58.280,00:22:59.830
And you include the 0 vector.,00:22:59.830,00:23:03.880
"So even this trivially simple
span is a valid subspace.",00:23:03.880,00:23:09.640
"And that just backs up the
idea that we showed here.",00:23:09.640,00:23:12.460
"That, in general, I could
have just made",00:23:12.460,00:23:14.290
this a set of n vectors.,00:23:14.290,00:23:16.740
"I picked three vectors right
here, but it could've been n",00:23:16.740,00:23:19.060
"vectors and I could have used
the same argument that the",00:23:19.060,00:23:21.490
"span of n vectors is a
valid subspace of Rn.",00:23:21.490,00:23:26.980
And I showed it right there.,00:23:26.980,00:23:29.050
