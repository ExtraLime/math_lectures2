"Hello everyone. So far in the series on
data structures,",00:00:00.149,00:00:03.790
"we have talked about some of the linear
data structures like array,",00:00:03.790,00:00:07.830
"linked list, stack and queue. In all these
structure, data is arranged in a linear or",00:00:07.830,00:00:13.769
"sequential manner, so we can call
them linear data structures",00:00:13.769,00:00:17.400
"and we've also talked about tree which
is a non-linear data structure.",00:00:17.400,00:00:22.240
"Tree is a hierarchical structure. Now as
we understand data structures are ways to",00:00:22.240,00:00:27.779
"store and organize data,",00:00:27.779,00:00:29.650
"and for different kinds of data we use
different kinds of data structures.",00:00:29.650,00:00:33.590
"In this lesson, we're going to introduce
you to another non linear data",00:00:33.590,00:00:37.930
structure,00:00:37.930,00:00:38.440
"that has got its application in a wide
number of scenarios in computer science.",00:00:38.440,00:00:42.850
"It is used to model and represent a
variety of systems",00:00:42.850,00:00:46.780
and this data structure is graph.,00:00:46.780,00:00:49.820
"When we study data structures, we often
first study them as",00:00:49.820,00:00:53.620
"mathematical or logical models. Here
also,",00:00:53.620,00:00:57.070
"we will first study graph as a
mathematical or logical model",00:00:57.070,00:01:00.770
"and we will go into implementation
details later.",00:01:00.770,00:01:03.890
"Okay so let's get started. A graph just
like a tree",00:01:03.890,00:01:07.780
"is a collection of objects or entities that
we call ",00:01:07.780,00:01:10.979
"nodes or vertices, connected to each
other through",00:01:10.979,00:01:14.830
a set of edges. But in a tree,00:01:14.830,00:01:18.170
"connections are bound to be in a certain
way. In a tree that our rules",00:01:18.170,00:01:22.939
"dictating the connection among the nodes.
In a tree with",00:01:22.939,00:01:26.270
"N Nodes, we must have exactly",00:01:26.270,00:01:29.329
N - 1 edges. One edge for,00:01:29.329,00:01:32.880
"each parent child relationship. As
we know an edge",00:01:32.880,00:01:36.350
"in a tree is for a parent child
relationship and all nodes in a tree",00:01:36.350,00:01:40.829
"except the root node would have apparent
would have exactly 1 parent",00:01:40.829,00:01:45.630
"and that's why if they are N nodes, it
must be exactly N - 1 edges.",00:01:45.630,00:01:50.460
"In a tree, all nodes must be reachable
from the root",00:01:50.460,00:01:53.899
"and there must be exactly one possible
path from root",00:01:53.899,00:01:57.950
"to a node. Now in a graph there are no
rules",00:01:57.950,00:02:01.350
"dictating the connection among the nodes.
A graph contains",00:02:01.350,00:02:05.189
a set of nodes and a set of edges,00:02:05.189,00:02:08.300
"and edges can be connecting nodes in any
possible way.",00:02:08.300,00:02:11.870
"Tree is only a special kind of graph.
Now graph",00:02:11.870,00:02:15.739
"as a concept has been studied
extensively in mathematics.",00:02:15.739,00:02:19.239
"If you have taken a course on discrete
mathematics",00:02:19.239,00:02:22.270
"then you must be knowing about graphs
already. In computer science, we basically",00:02:22.270,00:02:27.260
"study and implement the same concept
of graph from mathematics.",00:02:27.260,00:02:30.640
"The study of graph is often referred to
as",00:02:30.640,00:02:33.959
graph theory. In pure mathematical terms,00:02:33.959,00:02:37.260
we can define graph something like this.,00:02:37.260,00:02:40.340
"A graph G is in order pair of a set
V of vertices",00:02:40.340,00:02:45.000
"and a set E of edges. Now I'm using
some mathematical jargon here.",00:02:45.000,00:02:50.310
"An ordered pair is just a pair of
mathematical objects",00:02:50.310,00:02:54.190
in which the order of objects in the pair,00:02:54.190,00:02:57.450
"matters. This is how we write and
represent an ordered",00:02:57.450,00:03:01.050
"pair, objects separated by comma put
within parenthesis.",00:03:01.050,00:03:05.330
"Now because the order here matters. We
can say that V",00:03:05.330,00:03:09.470
"is the first object in the pair and E
is the second object.",00:03:09.470,00:03:13.260
"An ordered pair A, B is not equal to B, A",00:03:13.260,00:03:17.400
unless A and B are equal.,00:03:17.400,00:03:20.569
"In our definition of graph here, first
object in the pair",00:03:20.569,00:03:24.440
"must always be a set of vertices and
the second object must be a set of edges",00:03:24.440,00:03:29.970
"that's why we are calling the pair 
an ordered pair.",00:03:29.970,00:03:33.549
"We also have concept of unordered pair.
An unordered pair",00:03:33.549,00:03:38.040
"is simply a set of two elements. Order is
not important here.",00:03:38.040,00:03:42.019
"We write an unordered pair using curly
brackets or braces.",00:03:42.019,00:03:45.560
"Because the order is not important here,
unordered pair",00:03:45.560,00:03:49.310
"A, B is equal to B, A. It doesn't matter
which object is first and",00:03:49.310,00:03:54.470
"which object is second. Okay coming back,
so",00:03:54.470,00:03:58.040
"a graph of is an ordered pair of a set of
vertices and a set of",00:03:58.040,00:04:01.959
"edges and G = (V,E) is a formal
mathematical notation",00:04:01.959,00:04:06.840
"that we use to define a graph. Now I
have a graph drawn here",00:04:06.840,00:04:10.780
"in the right. This graph is 8 vertices
and 10 edges.",00:04:10.780,00:04:15.049
"What I want to do is I want give some
names to these vertices",00:04:15.049,00:04:19.280
"because each node in a graph must
have some identification.",00:04:19.280,00:04:22.970
It can be a name or it can be an index.,00:04:22.970,00:04:26.910
"I'm naming these vertices as V1, V2",00:04:26.910,00:04:30.020
"V3, V4, V5 and so on, and this
naming is not indicative of any order.",00:04:30.020,00:04:35.930
"There is no 1st, 2nd and 3rd Node here. I could
give",00:04:35.930,00:04:39.389
"any name to any node. So my set of 
vertices here",00:04:39.389,00:04:43.570
"is this. We have 8 elements in the
set V1, V2, V3, V4,",00:04:43.570,00:04:48.560
"V5, V6, V7 and V8. So this is my set of
vertices for this graph.",00:04:48.560,00:04:54.860
"Now what's my set of edges. To answer
this",00:04:54.860,00:04:58.530
"we first need to know how to represent
an edge.",00:04:58.530,00:05:02.410
"An edge is uniquely identified by it's
2",00:05:02.410,00:05:05.789
"endpoints, so we can just write the names
of the two endpoint",00:05:05.789,00:05:10.970
"of an edge as a pair and it can be
a representation for the edge.",00:05:10.970,00:05:16.669
"But edges can be of two types. We can
have",00:05:16.669,00:05:19.960
"a directed edge in which connection is
one-way",00:05:19.960,00:05:23.979
"or we can have an undirected edge in
which connection is two way.",00:05:23.979,00:05:28.620
"In this example graph that I'm showing
here, edges are undirected",00:05:28.620,00:05:32.850
"but if you remember the tree that I had
shown earlier",00:05:32.850,00:05:36.550
"then we had directed edges in that tree.
With this directed edge that I'm showing",00:05:36.550,00:05:41.060
"you here,",00:05:41.060,00:05:41.860
we are saying that there is link or path,00:05:41.860,00:05:45.250
"from vertex U to V but we cannot
assume a path from V to U.",00:05:45.250,00:05:50.449
"This connection is one way. For
a directed edge,",00:05:50.449,00:05:53.639
"one of the endpoints would be the
origin and other end point would be",00:05:53.639,00:05:58.690
the destination and we draw the edge with,00:05:58.690,00:06:01.780
"an arrow head pointing towards the
destination.",00:06:01.780,00:06:05.380
"For our edge here, origin is U and
destination is V.",00:06:05.380,00:06:10.259
"A directed edge can be to represented as
an ordered pair,",00:06:10.259,00:06:13.940
"first element in the pair can be the
origin and second element can be the",00:06:13.940,00:06:17.840
destination.,00:06:17.840,00:06:19.610
"So with this directed edge represented
as ordered pair",00:06:19.610,00:06:22.919
"(U,V), we have a path from U to V.",00:06:22.919,00:06:26.900
"If we want a path from V to U, when need
to draw",00:06:26.900,00:06:30.289
"another directed edge here with V as 
origin",00:06:30.289,00:06:33.610
"and U as destination and this edge can be
the represented as ordered pair",00:06:33.610,00:06:38.319
"(V,U), the upper one here is (U,V) and the
below one is",00:06:38.319,00:06:43.060
"(V,U) and they are not same.",00:06:43.060,00:06:46.340
"Now if the edge is undirected, the
connection",00:06:46.340,00:06:49.350
"is 2 way and undirected edge can be
to represented as an",00:06:49.350,00:06:53.400
"unordered pair here because the edge is
bi directional",00:06:53.400,00:06:57.280
"origin and destination are not fixed. We
only need to know what two end points",00:06:57.280,00:07:01.759
have been connected by the edge.,00:07:01.759,00:07:04.009
"So now that we know how to present edges,
we can write the set of edges for this",00:07:04.009,00:07:08.310
example graph here.,00:07:08.310,00:07:10.060
"We have an undirected edge between V1
and V2",00:07:10.060,00:07:14.210
"then we have 1 between V1 and V3 and
then be have V1 V4.",00:07:14.210,00:07:19.569
"This is really simple and just go ahead
and write all of them.",00:07:19.569,00:07:22.870
"So this is my set of edges. Typically in
a graph,",00:07:22.870,00:07:26.620
"all edges would either be directed or
undirected.",00:07:26.620,00:07:30.560
"It's possible for a graph to have both
directed and undirected edges",00:07:30.560,00:07:34.360
"but we are not going to study such
graphs, we are only going to study graphs",00:07:34.360,00:07:38.819
"in which all edges would either be
directed or",00:07:38.819,00:07:42.270
"undirected. A graph with all directed
edges",00:07:42.270,00:07:45.460
is called a directed graph or digraph,00:07:45.460,00:07:49.199
"and a graph with all undirected ages is
called an undirected graph.",00:07:49.199,00:07:54.419
"There is no special name for an
undirected graph.",00:07:54.419,00:07:57.780
"Usually, if the graph directed, we
explicitly say that it's",00:07:57.780,00:08:02.069
"directed graph or digraph. So these are
two types of graphs.",00:08:02.069,00:08:06.440
Directed graph or digraph in which edges,00:08:06.440,00:08:09.560
are uni-directional or ordered pairs and,00:08:09.560,00:08:12.819
"undirected graph in which edges are
bi-directional",00:08:12.819,00:08:16.440
"or unordered pairs. Now many real-world
systems and",00:08:16.440,00:08:20.830
"problems can be modeled using a graph.
Graphs can be used to represent",00:08:20.830,00:08:25.440
"any collection of objects having some
kind of",00:08:25.440,00:08:28.490
"pairwise relationship. Let's have a look
at some of the interesting examples.",00:08:28.490,00:08:33.469
"A social network like Facebook can be
represented as an",00:08:33.469,00:08:37.370
"undirected graph. A user would be a node in
the graph",00:08:37.370,00:08:41.430
"and if 2 user are friends, there
would be an edge connecting them.",00:08:41.430,00:08:46.010
"A real social network would have millions
and billions of nodes.",00:08:46.010,00:08:50.010
"I can show only few in my diagram here
because I'm short of space.",00:08:50.010,00:08:53.640
"Now social network is an undirected
graphs because friendship",00:08:53.640,00:08:57.660
"is a mutual relationship. If I'm your
friend, you are my friend too.",00:08:57.660,00:09:01.860
"So connections have to be 2 way. Now once
a system",00:09:01.860,00:09:05.730
"is modeled as a graph a lot of problems
can easily be solved",00:09:05.730,00:09:10.050
"by applying standard algorithms
in graph theory.",00:09:10.050,00:09:13.760
"Like here in this social network, let's
say we want to do something like",00:09:13.760,00:09:17.519
"suggest friends to a user. Let's say we
want to suggest some connections to",00:09:17.519,00:09:22.450
Rama.,00:09:22.450,00:09:23.730
"One possible approach to do so can be
suggesting friends of friends",00:09:23.730,00:09:27.980
"who are not connected already. Rama has
3 friends,",00:09:27.980,00:09:31.910
"Ella, Bob and Katie and friends of",00:09:31.910,00:09:34.930
"3 that are not connected to Rama
already",00:09:34.930,00:09:38.000
"can be suggested. There is no friend of
Ella which is not connected to Rama",00:09:38.000,00:09:41.839
already.,00:09:41.839,00:09:42.860
"Bob however, has 3 friends Tom, Sam,",00:09:42.860,00:09:46.470
"and Lee that are not friends with Rama so
they can be suggested",00:09:46.470,00:09:50.910
and katie has two friends Lee and Swati,00:09:50.910,00:09:54.100
"that are not connected to Rama.We have
counted Lee already,",00:09:54.100,00:09:57.709
"so in all we can suggest these for users
to Rama.",00:09:57.709,00:10:02.430
"Now even though we described this
problem in context of a social network.",00:10:02.430,00:10:06.700
"This is a standard graph problem. The
problem here in",00:10:06.700,00:10:10.380
"pure graph terms is finding all nodes
having lenght of",00:10:10.380,00:10:14.600
"shortest path from a given
node equal to 2.",00:10:14.600,00:10:18.029
"Standard algorithms can be applied to
solve this problem.",00:10:18.029,00:10:21.570
"We'll talk about concepts like path in
a graph in some time.",00:10:21.570,00:10:24.990
"For now just know that the problem that
we just described in context of",00:10:24.990,00:10:28.640
"a social network is a standard graph
problem.",00:10:28.640,00:10:32.230
"Okay so a social network like Facebook
is an undirected graph",00:10:32.230,00:10:36.940
"Now let's have a look at another example.
Interlinked",00:10:36.940,00:10:40.160
"web pages on the internet or the World
Wide Web",00:10:40.160,00:10:43.680
"can be represented as a directed graph.
A web page",00:10:43.680,00:10:47.730
"that would have a unique address or URL
would be a node in the graph",00:10:47.730,00:10:52.329
"and we can have a directed edge if a
page contains link to another page.",00:10:52.329,00:10:58.140
"Now once again, there are billions of pages
on the web",00:10:58.140,00:11:01.600
"but I can show only few here. The edges
in this graph are directed because",00:11:01.600,00:11:06.430
"that relationship is not mutual this
time.",00:11:06.430,00:11:09.579
"If page A has a link to page B then
it's not necessary that page B will",00:11:09.579,00:11:14.600
also have a link to page A.,00:11:14.600,00:11:16.050
"Let's say one of the pages on
mycodeschool.com has",00:11:16.050,00:11:19.790
a tutorial on graph and on this page,00:11:19.790,00:11:22.810

like Google perform very regularly",00:12:25.480,00:12:30.220
"is web crawling. Search engines use a
program called web crawler",00:12:30.220,00:12:35.459
"that systematically browsers the 
World Wide Web",00:12:35.459,00:12:38.870
"to collect and store data about web
pages. Search engines can then use this",00:12:38.870,00:12:43.350
data,00:12:43.350,00:12:43.899
"to provide quick and accurate results
against search queries.",00:12:43.899,00:12:48.320
"Now even though in this context, we are
using a nice and heavy term like web",00:12:48.320,00:12:52.550
crawling.,00:12:52.550,00:12:53.200
"Web crawling is basically graph
traversal",00:12:53.200,00:12:56.420
"or in simpler words, act of visiting all
nodes in a graph",00:12:56.420,00:13:01.060
"and no prizes for guessing that there
are standard algorithms for graph",00:13:01.060,00:13:05.100
traversal.,00:13:05.100,00:13:06.300
"We will be studying graph traversal
algorithms in a later lessons.",00:13:06.300,00:13:09.950
"Okay now the next thing that I want to
talk about is concept of a",00:13:09.950,00:13:13.740
"weighted graph. Sometimes in a graph, all
connections cannot be treated as equal.",00:13:13.740,00:13:19.279
"Some connections can be preferable to
others",00:13:19.279,00:13:22.380
like for example we can represent,00:13:22.380,00:13:25.550
"intercity road network that is the
network of highways and",00:13:25.550,00:13:29.220
"free ways between cities as an
undirected graph.",00:13:29.220,00:13:33.459
"I'm assuming that all highways would be
bi-directional.",00:13:33.459,00:13:36.920
"Intra-city road network that is road
network within a city",00:13:36.920,00:13:41.060
would definitely have one-way roads and so,00:13:41.060,00:13:44.410
"Intra-city network must be
represented as a directed graph",00:13:44.410,00:13:48.420
"but intercity road network in my opinion
can be represented as an",00:13:48.420,00:13:52.079
"undirected graph. Now clearly we cannot
treat all connections as equal here.",00:13:52.079,00:13:57.000
"Roads would be of different lengths and
to perform a lot of tasks",00:13:57.000,00:14:00.930
"to solve a lot of problems, we need to
take length of roads into account.",00:14:00.930,00:14:05.360
"In such cases, we associate some weight or",00:14:05.360,00:14:08.649
"cost with every edge. We label the edges with
their weights.",00:14:08.649,00:14:12.769
"In this case weight can be lenght of the roads,
so what to do here is I'll just",00:14:12.769,00:14:17.760
"label this edges with some values for
the lenghts.",00:14:17.760,00:14:22.079
Let's say these values are in kilometers,00:14:22.079,00:14:25.449
"and now edges in this graph are weighted and
this graph can be called weighted",00:14:25.449,00:14:30.570
graph.,00:14:30.570,00:14:31.199
"Let's say in this graph, we want to
pick the best route",00:14:31.199,00:14:35.209
from city A to city D.,00:14:35.209,00:14:38.490
"Have a look at these four possible
routes, I am showing them in different",00:14:38.490,00:14:41.980
colors.,00:14:41.980,00:14:43.199
Now if I would treat all edges as equal,00:14:43.199,00:14:46.350
"then I would say that the green route
through B and C",00:14:46.350,00:14:50.329
"and a red route through E and F are equally
good.",00:14:50.329,00:14:54.500
"Both these paths have to three edges and
this yellow route through E",00:14:54.500,00:14:58.670
"is the best because we have only two
edges in this path.",00:14:58.670,00:15:03.089
"But with different weights assigned to
the connections, I need to add up",00:15:03.089,00:15:07.410
"weights of edges in a path to calculate
total cost.",00:15:07.410,00:15:11.050
"When I'm taking weight into account shortest
route",00:15:11.050,00:15:14.199
"is through B and C. Connections have
different weights and",00:15:14.199,00:15:18.290
"this is really important here in this
graph. Actually, we can look at all the",00:15:18.290,00:15:22.100
graphs as weighted graphs,00:15:22.100,00:15:24.480
"An unweighted graph can basically be seen
as",00:15:24.480,00:15:27.600
"a weighted graph in which weight of all
the edges",00:15:27.600,00:15:30.820
"is same and typically we assume to weight
as one.",00:15:30.820,00:15:35.709
"Okay so we have represented inter-city cities
road network as",00:15:35.709,00:15:39.709
"weighted undirected graph. Social network
was an unweighted undirected graph",00:15:39.709,00:15:45.910
"and World Wide Web was an unweighted
directed graph",00:15:45.910,00:15:49.940
and this one is a weighted undirected graph.,00:15:49.940,00:15:53.860
"Now this was inter-city road network. I
think intra-city road network that is",00:15:53.860,00:15:58.190
"road network within a city can be
modeled as",00:15:58.190,00:16:01.930
"a weighted directed graph because in a
city that would be some one ways.",00:16:01.930,00:16:06.920
"Intersections in interest city's road
network would be Nodes",00:16:06.920,00:16:10.250
"and road segments would be our edges,",00:16:10.250,00:16:14.630
"and by the way we can also draw an
undirected graph as directed.",00:16:14.630,00:16:19.320
"It's just that for each undirected edge
we will have 2 directed edges.",00:16:19.320,00:16:24.089
"We may not be able to redraw a directed
graph has undirected",00:16:24.089,00:16:27.850
"but we can always redraw an undirected
graph as directed.",00:16:27.850,00:16:32.050
"Okay I'll stop here now. This much is
good for an introductory lesson.",00:16:32.050,00:16:36.829
"In next lesson, we will talk about some more
properties of graph.",00:16:36.829,00:16:40.040
"This is it for this lesson. Thanks for
watching !",00:16:40.040,00:16:42.339
