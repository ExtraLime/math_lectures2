"We know that if we have some
linear transformation, that",00:00:00.760,00:00:03.430
"the transformation from x to y
-- and these are just sets,",00:00:03.430,00:00:08.240
"sets of vectors, and T is a
linear transformation from y",00:00:08.240,00:00:13.170
"to z-- that we can construct a
composition of s with T that",00:00:13.170,00:00:18.850
"is a linear transformation
from x all the way to z.",00:00:18.850,00:00:23.360
"We saw this several
videos ago.",00:00:23.360,00:00:25.440
"And the definition of our linear
transformation, or the",00:00:25.440,00:00:28.860
"composition of our linear
transformation.",00:00:28.860,00:00:30.930
"So the composition of s with t,
applied to someone vector x",00:00:30.930,00:00:36.040
"in our set x, our domain,
is equal to s of t of x.",00:00:36.040,00:00:45.980
This was our definition.,00:00:45.980,00:00:47.340
"And then we went on and we said,
look, if s of x can be",00:00:47.340,00:00:52.770
"represented as the matrix
multiplication a x, the matrix",00:00:52.770,00:00:59.770
"vector product, and if T of x
can be represented -- or the",00:00:59.770,00:01:05.280
"transformation T can be
represented-- as the product",00:01:05.280,00:01:07.850
"of the matrix b with x, we saw
that this thing right here --",00:01:07.850,00:01:12.690
"which is of course, if we just
write this way, this is equal",00:01:12.690,00:01:14.820
"to a times T times x, which is
just b x -- we saw in multiple",00:01:14.820,00:01:21.220
"videos now that this is
equivalent to, by our",00:01:21.220,00:01:24.580
"definition of matrix products,
the matrix a b -- right?",00:01:24.580,00:01:30.030
"When you take the product of
two matrices you just get",00:01:30.030,00:01:32.130
"another matrix -- the
product a b times x.",00:01:32.130,00:01:36.210
"So you take essentially the
first linear transformation in",00:01:36.210,00:01:39.760
"your composition, its matrix,
which was a, and you take the",00:01:39.760,00:01:43.200
product with the second one.,00:01:43.200,00:01:44.880
"Fair enough, all of this
is review so far.",00:01:44.880,00:01:47.230
"Let's take three linear
transformations.",00:01:47.230,00:01:50.440
"Let's say that I have the linear
transformation h, and",00:01:50.440,00:01:53.710
"when I apply that to a vector
x, it's equivalent to",00:01:53.710,00:01:56.900
"multiplying my vector
x by the matrix a.",00:01:56.900,00:02:00.220
"Let's say I have the linear
transformation g.",00:02:00.220,00:02:05.490
"When I applied that to a vector
x, it's equivalent to",00:02:05.490,00:02:08.400
"multiplying that vectrix -- that
vector, there should be a",00:02:08.400,00:02:12.250
"new concept called a vetrix --
it's equivalent to multiplying",00:02:12.250,00:02:15.320
"that vector times
the matrix b.",00:02:15.320,00:02:18.170
"And then I have a final linear
transformation f.",00:02:18.170,00:02:23.410
"When it's applied to some vector
x, it's equivalent to",00:02:23.410,00:02:26.380
"multiplying that vector
x times the matrix z.",00:02:26.380,00:02:32.280
"Now what I'm curious about is
what happens when I take the",00:02:32.280,00:02:35.810
"composition of h with g, and
then I take the composition of",00:02:35.810,00:02:43.570
"that with f -- these are all
linear transformations -- and",00:02:43.570,00:02:50.070
"then I apply that to
some vector x.",00:02:50.070,00:02:52.350
"Which is necessarily going to be
in the domain of this guy.",00:02:57.520,00:03:01.070
"I haven't actually drawn out
their domain and co-domain",00:03:01.070,00:03:03.800
"definitions, but I think
you get the idea.",00:03:03.800,00:03:06.020
"So let's explore what this
is a little bit.",00:03:06.020,00:03:09.290
"Well by the definition of
what a -- let's go back.",00:03:09.290,00:03:12.610
"By this definition right here
of what composition even",00:03:12.610,00:03:15.320
"means, we can just apply that
to this right here.",00:03:15.320,00:03:19.270
"So we could just imagine this as
being our s, and then this",00:03:19.270,00:03:25.240
is our T right there.,00:03:25.240,00:03:27.520
"Then what is this going
to be equal to?",00:03:27.520,00:03:29.280
"If we just do a straight up
pattern match right there,",00:03:29.280,00:03:31.640
"this is going to be equal to
s, the transformation s,",00:03:31.640,00:03:35.530
"applied to the transformation
f, applied to x.",00:03:35.530,00:03:38.620
So s is h of g.,00:03:38.620,00:03:40.830
"So it is h -- or I should say h
of g -- the composition of h",00:03:40.830,00:03:46.750
"with g, that is our s.",00:03:46.750,00:03:51.180
"And then I apply that
to f applied to x.",00:03:51.180,00:03:58.300
f is our t.,00:03:58.300,00:03:59.360
"I apply that to f applied
to x, just like that.",00:03:59.360,00:04:04.470
Now what is this equal to?,00:04:04.470,00:04:08.740
"Now we can imagine that
this is our x.",00:04:08.740,00:04:12.225
"If we just pattern match,
according to this definition,",00:04:12.225,00:04:14.670
"that this and this guy right
here, that this is our t, and",00:04:14.670,00:04:19.480
that this is our s.,00:04:19.480,00:04:23.160
"And so if we just pattern
match here,",00:04:23.160,00:04:24.790
this is equal to what?,00:04:24.790,00:04:26.040
"This is just straight from the
definition of a composition.",00:04:26.040,00:04:29.430
"So it's equal to s of -- s is
our h -- so h of t, which in",00:04:29.430,00:04:35.720
"this case is g, g
applied to x.",00:04:35.720,00:04:39.010
"But instead of an x, we have
this vector here, which was",00:04:39.010,00:04:42.200
"the transformation
f applied to x.",00:04:42.200,00:04:44.650
So g of f of x.,00:04:44.650,00:04:47.960
That's what this is equal to.,00:04:47.960,00:04:48.980
"The composition of h with
g, and the composition",00:04:48.980,00:04:52.550
"competition of f with h, the
composition of h and g, all of",00:04:52.550,00:04:57.710
"that applied to x is equal
to h of g of f of x.",00:04:57.710,00:05:02.370
Now what is this equal to?,00:05:02.370,00:05:06.310
"Well this is equal to -- I'll
do it right here -- this is",00:05:06.310,00:05:09.700
"equal to h, the transformation
h, applied to -- what is this",00:05:09.700,00:05:18.210
term right here?,00:05:18.210,00:05:18.530
I'll do it in pink.,00:05:18.530,00:05:20.570
What is this?,00:05:20.570,00:05:22.080
"That is the composition of
g and f applied to x.",00:05:22.080,00:05:25.100
"You can just replace s with g,
and f with T, and you'll get",00:05:25.100,00:05:28.620
that right there.,00:05:28.620,00:05:29.920
"So this is just equal to the
composition of g with f",00:05:29.920,00:05:36.160
applied to x.,00:05:36.160,00:05:39.110
That's all that is.,00:05:39.110,00:05:41.420
"Now, what is this equal
to right there?",00:05:41.420,00:05:46.190
"And it's probably confusing
to see two parentheses in",00:05:46.190,00:05:48.280
"different colors, but
you get the idea.",00:05:48.280,00:05:49.730
What is this equal to?,00:05:49.730,00:05:51.300
"Well, just go back to your
definition of the composition",00:05:51.300,00:05:53.270
"-- I just want to make it very
clear what we're doing.",00:05:53.270,00:05:56.760
"This is, if you imagine this
being your T and then this",00:05:56.760,00:06:00.500
"being your s, this is just the
composition of s with T,",00:06:00.500,00:06:03.700
applied to x.,00:06:03.700,00:06:05.270
"So this is just equal to --
I'll write it this way.",00:06:05.270,00:06:08.730
"This is equal to -- I shouldn't
write s's -- this is",00:06:08.730,00:06:11.530
"a composition of h with the
composition of g and f.",00:06:11.530,00:06:18.820
"And then all of that
applied to x.",00:06:18.820,00:06:21.210
Now why did I do all of this?,00:06:21.210,00:06:23.190
"Well one, to show you that the
composition is associative.",00:06:23.190,00:06:26.330
"I went all the way here and then
I went all the way back.",00:06:26.330,00:06:28.710
"And essentially it doesn't
matter where you put the",00:06:28.710,00:06:30.880
parentheses.,00:06:30.880,00:06:31.490
"The composition of h with g with
f, is equivalent to the",00:06:31.490,00:06:37.130
"composition of h with the
composition of g and f.",00:06:37.130,00:06:40.050
"That these two things are
equivalent, and essentially",00:06:40.050,00:06:43.020
"these two things, you can
just re-write them.",00:06:43.020,00:06:45.800
"The parentheses are essentially
unnecessary.",00:06:45.800,00:06:49.210
"You can write this as a
composition of h with g with",00:06:49.210,00:06:53.020
"f, all of that applied to x.",00:06:53.020,00:06:57.070
"Now, I took the time to say
that each of these linear",00:06:57.070,00:07:02.400
"transformations I can
represent as matrix",00:07:02.400,00:07:04.520
multiplications.,00:07:04.520,00:07:05.250
Why did I do that?,00:07:05.250,00:07:06.930
"Well we saw before, that any
composition, when you take the",00:07:06.930,00:07:09.860
"composition of s with T, the
matrix version of this",00:07:09.860,00:07:14.220
"transformation of this
composition is going to be",00:07:14.220,00:07:17.900
"equal to the product -- by our
definition of matrix matrix",00:07:17.900,00:07:21.520
"products -- the product of the
s's transformation matrix and",00:07:21.520,00:07:26.480
T's transformation matrix.,00:07:26.480,00:07:28.690
"So what are these going
to be equal to?",00:07:28.690,00:07:32.010
"So this one right here --
if you think of this",00:07:32.010,00:07:34.810
"transformation right here, this
statement right here, its",00:07:34.810,00:07:38.260
"matrix version of it--
so let me write that.",00:07:38.260,00:07:40.540
"A matrix version of the
composition of h with g, and",00:07:40.540,00:07:49.930
"then the composition of that
with f, applied to x, is going",00:07:49.930,00:07:57.300
"to be equal to -- and we've
seen this before -- the",00:07:57.300,00:08:03.930
product of these matrices.,00:08:03.930,00:08:05.510
"So this composition, its matrix
is going to be a b.",00:08:05.510,00:08:10.500
"h and g, their matrices
are a and b.",00:08:10.500,00:08:12.620
"So it's going to be a b -- and
I'll do it in parentheses.",00:08:12.620,00:08:19.220
"And then you take that matrix,
and you take the product -- so",00:08:19.220,00:08:22.380
"this guy's matrix representation
is a b, right?",00:08:22.380,00:08:26.420
"And this guy's matrix
representation is c.",00:08:26.420,00:08:28.840
"So the matrix representation
of this whole thing is this",00:08:28.840,00:08:31.690
"guy, taking the product of a b,
and then taking the product",00:08:31.690,00:08:34.480
of that with c.,00:08:34.480,00:08:36.380
So a b.,00:08:36.380,00:08:37.640
and then c.,00:08:37.640,00:08:38.929
"And then if you look at this
guy right here -- and of",00:08:38.929,00:08:42.179
"course all of that times a
vector x, all of that time",00:08:42.179,00:08:46.110
"some vector x, right there.",00:08:46.110,00:08:48.430
That's the vector x.,00:08:48.430,00:08:49.860
"Now let's look at this
one right here.",00:08:49.860,00:08:52.730
"If we take the composition of
h with the composition of g",00:08:52.730,00:08:59.220
"and f, and apply all of that to
some vector x, what is that",00:08:59.220,00:09:04.550
equivalent to?,00:09:04.550,00:09:05.750
"Well this composition right
here, the matrix version of",00:09:05.750,00:09:10.180
"it, I guess we can say, is going
to be the product b c.",00:09:10.180,00:09:13.170
"And we're going to
apply that to x.",00:09:13.170,00:09:15.012
"So we're going to have
the product b c.",00:09:15.012,00:09:18.340
"And then we're going to take the
product of that with this",00:09:18.340,00:09:20.770
"guy's matrix representation,
which is a.",00:09:20.770,00:09:24.980
And we've shown this before.,00:09:24.980,00:09:26.530
"We never showed it with
three, but it extends.",00:09:26.530,00:09:30.020
"I kind of showed it extends, so
you can just keep applying",00:09:30.020,00:09:32.430
the definition.,00:09:32.430,00:09:33.420
"You can keep applying this
property right here, and so",00:09:33.420,00:09:36.290
it'll just naturally extend.,00:09:36.290,00:09:37.900
"Because every time, we're
just taking the",00:09:37.900,00:09:39.160
composition of two things.,00:09:39.160,00:09:40.630
"Even though it looks like we're
taking the composition",00:09:40.630,00:09:42.030
"of three, we're taking the
composition of two things",00:09:42.030,00:09:44.160
first here.,00:09:44.160,00:09:45.150
"And then we get its matrix
representation.",00:09:45.150,00:09:47.640
"And then we take the composition
of that with this",00:09:47.640,00:09:49.310
other thing.,00:09:49.310,00:09:50.240
"So the matrix representation of
the entire composition is",00:09:50.240,00:09:53.850
"going to be this matrix
times this matrix.",00:09:53.850,00:09:57.640
Which I did here.,00:09:57.640,00:09:58.820
"Similarly, here we take first
the composition of these two",00:09:58.820,00:10:04.240
"linear transformations, and
their matrix representation",00:10:04.240,00:10:07.430
will be that right there.,00:10:07.430,00:10:08.900
"And then we take the composition
of that with that.",00:10:08.900,00:10:12.550
"So its entire matrix
representation is going to be",00:10:12.550,00:10:16.120
"guy's matrix times this
guy's matrix.",00:10:16.120,00:10:18.390
So a times b c.,00:10:18.390,00:10:20.220
"And of course, all of that
applied to the vector x.",00:10:20.220,00:10:23.530
"Now, in this video I've showed
you that these two things are",00:10:23.530,00:10:26.990
equivalent.,00:10:26.990,00:10:27.840
"If anything, the parentheses
are completely unnecessary.",00:10:27.840,00:10:31.800
And I showed you that there.,00:10:31.800,00:10:32.920
"They both essentially boil
down to h of g of f of x.",00:10:32.920,00:10:37.420
"So these two things
are equivalent.",00:10:37.420,00:10:39.410
"So we could say, essentially,
that these two things over",00:10:39.410,00:10:42.620
here are equivalent.,00:10:42.620,00:10:44.520
"Or that a b, the product a b,
and then taking the product of",00:10:44.520,00:10:49.390
"that matrix with the matrix c,
is equivalent to taking the",00:10:49.390,00:10:53.290
product a with the matrix b c.,00:10:53.290,00:10:58.040
"Which is just another
product matrix.",00:10:58.040,00:11:00.290
"Or another way of saying it is
that these parentheses don't",00:11:00.290,00:11:02.590
"matter, that all of these
is just equal to a b c.",00:11:02.590,00:11:07.030
"Or -- I mean, this is just a
statement that matrix products",00:11:07.030,00:11:11.430
"exhibit the associative
property.",00:11:11.430,00:11:13.315
"It doesn't matter where you
put the parentheses.",00:11:18.350,00:11:21.040
"And you know, sometimes it's
confusing me, the word",00:11:21.040,00:11:23.080
associative.,00:11:23.080,00:11:23.680
"It just means it doesn't matter
where you put the",00:11:23.680,00:11:25.840
parentheses.,00:11:25.840,00:11:26.780
"Matrix products do not exhibit
the commutative property.",00:11:26.780,00:11:30.040
We saw that in the last video.,00:11:30.040,00:11:32.140
"In general, we cannot make
the statement that a b",00:11:32.140,00:11:37.050
is equal to b a.,00:11:37.050,00:11:39.280
We cannot do that.,00:11:39.280,00:11:41.020
"And in fact in the last video
-- I think it was the last",00:11:41.020,00:11:43.550
"video -- I showed you that if a
b is defined, sometimes b a",00:11:43.550,00:11:46.720
is not even defined.,00:11:46.720,00:11:47.660
"Or if b a is defined, sometimes
a b isn't defined.",00:11:47.660,00:11:50.030
So it's not commutative.,00:11:50.030,00:11:51.820
"It is associative, though.",00:11:51.820,00:11:53.630
"In the next video, I'll see if
matrix products are actually",00:11:53.630,00:11:57.050
distributive.,00:11:57.050,00:11:58.300
