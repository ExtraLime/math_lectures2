"In the last video I introduced
you to the idea of the chain",00:00:00.710,00:00:04.470
rule with partial derivatives.,00:00:04.470,00:00:05.520
"And we said, well, if I have a
function, psi, Greek letter,",00:00:05.520,00:00:10.080
"psi, it's a function
of x and y.",00:00:10.080,00:00:14.020
"And if I wanted to take the
partial of this, with respect",00:00:14.020,00:00:16.770
"to-- no, I want to take the
derivative, not the partial--",00:00:16.770,00:00:19.360
"the derivative of this, with
respect to x, this is equal to",00:00:19.360,00:00:23.430
"the partial of psi, with respect
to x, plus the partial",00:00:23.430,00:00:29.540
"of psi, with respect
to y, times dy, dx.",00:00:29.540,00:00:35.400
"And in the last video I didn't
prove it to you, but I",00:00:35.400,00:00:37.630
"hopefully gave you a little bit
of intuition that you can",00:00:37.630,00:00:40.260
believe me.,00:00:40.260,00:00:40.740
"But maybe one day I'll prove
it a little bit more",00:00:40.740,00:00:43.030
"rigorously, but you can find
proofs on the web if you are",00:00:43.030,00:00:46.120
"interested, for the chain rule
with partial derivatives.",00:00:46.120,00:00:49.960
"So let's put that aside and
let's explore another property",00:00:49.960,00:00:52.760
"of partial derivatives, and then
we're ready to get the",00:00:52.760,00:00:55.600
"intuition behind exact
equations.",00:00:55.600,00:00:57.080
"Because you're going to find,
it's fairly straightforward to",00:00:57.080,00:00:59.070
"solve exact equations, but the
intuition is a little bit",00:00:59.070,00:01:02.210
"more-- well, I don't want to say
it's difficult, because if",00:01:02.210,00:01:05.140
"you have the intuition,
you have it.",00:01:05.140,00:01:06.890
"So what if I had, say, this
function, psi, and I were to",00:01:06.890,00:01:11.490
"take the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to x, first.",00:01:11.490,00:01:16.580
I'll just write psi.,00:01:16.580,00:01:17.510
"I don't have to write
x and y every time.",00:01:17.510,00:01:19.640
"And then I were to take the
partial derivative with",00:01:19.640,00:01:22.890
respect to y.,00:01:22.890,00:01:25.485
"So just as a notation, this you
could write as, you could",00:01:28.920,00:01:32.730
"kind of view it as you're
multiplying the operators, so",00:01:32.730,00:01:34.620
it could be written like this.,00:01:34.620,00:01:36.050
"The partial del squared times
psi, or del squared psi, over",00:01:36.050,00:01:42.400
"del y del, or curly d x.",00:01:42.400,00:01:47.540
"And that can also be written
as-- and this is my preferred",00:01:47.540,00:01:50.330
"notation, because it doesn't
have all this extra junk",00:01:50.330,00:01:53.040
everywhere.,00:01:53.040,00:01:53.800
"You could just say, well, the
partial, we took the partial,",00:01:53.800,00:01:56.350
"with respect to x, first. So
this just means the partial of",00:01:56.350,00:02:00.050
"psi, with respect to x.",00:02:00.050,00:02:01.240
"And then we took the partial,
with respect to y.",00:02:01.240,00:02:04.060
"So that's one situation
to consider.",00:02:04.060,00:02:05.870
"What happens when we take the
partial, with respect to x,",00:02:05.870,00:02:07.970
and then y?,00:02:07.970,00:02:08.650
"So with respect to x, you hold
y constant to get just the",00:02:08.650,00:02:13.100
"partial, with respect to x.",00:02:13.100,00:02:14.190
Ignore the y there.,00:02:14.190,00:02:15.000
"And then you hold the x
constant, and you take the",00:02:15.000,00:02:17.060
"partial, with respect to y.",00:02:17.060,00:02:18.670
"So what's the difference between
that and if we were to",00:02:18.670,00:02:21.480
switch the order?,00:02:21.480,00:02:22.370
"So what happens if we were to--
I'll do it in a different",00:02:22.370,00:02:24.970
"color-- if we had psi, and we
were to take the partial, with",00:02:24.970,00:02:30.400
"respect to y, first, and then
we were to take the partial,",00:02:30.400,00:02:34.480
with respect to x?,00:02:34.480,00:02:36.510
"So just the notation, just so
you're comfortable with it,",00:02:36.510,00:02:40.640
"that would be-- so partial
x, partial y.",00:02:40.640,00:02:44.660
And this is the operator.,00:02:44.660,00:02:46.360
"And it might be a little
confusing that here, between",00:02:46.360,00:02:48.750
"these two notations, even though
they're the same thing,",00:02:48.750,00:02:51.060
the order is mixed.,00:02:51.060,00:02:52.740
"That's just because it's
just a different way of",00:02:52.740,00:02:54.250
thinking about it.,00:02:54.250,00:02:54.910
"This says, OK, partial first,
with respect to x, then y.",00:02:54.910,00:02:57.990
"This views it more as the
operator, so we took the",00:02:57.990,00:03:00.160
"partial of x first, and then
we took y, like you're",00:03:00.160,00:03:03.000
multiplying the operators.,00:03:03.000,00:03:04.950
"But anyway, so this can also be
written as the partial of",00:03:04.950,00:03:08.840
"y, with respect to x-- sorry,
the partial of y, and then we",00:03:08.840,00:03:13.070
"took the partial of that
with respect to x.",00:03:13.070,00:03:14.910
"Now, I'm going to tell you right
now, that if each of the",00:03:14.910,00:03:17.980
"first partials are continuous--
and most of the",00:03:17.980,00:03:20.840
"functions we've dealt with in
a normal domain, as long as",00:03:20.840,00:03:24.510
"there aren't any
discontinuities, or holes, or",00:03:24.510,00:03:26.780
"something strange in the
function definition, they",00:03:26.780,00:03:29.070
usually are continuous.,00:03:29.070,00:03:30.290
"And especially in a first-year
calculus or differential",00:03:30.290,00:03:32.990
"course, we're probably going to
be dealing with continuous",00:03:32.990,00:03:35.810
functions in soon. our domain.,00:03:35.810,00:03:37.620
"If both of these functions are
continuous, if both of the",00:03:37.620,00:03:40.480
"first partials are continuous,
then these two are going to be",00:03:40.480,00:03:45.410
equal to each other.,00:03:45.410,00:03:47.170
"So psi of xy is going to
be equal to psi of yx.",00:03:47.170,00:03:54.950
"Now, we can use this knowledge,
which is the chain",00:03:54.950,00:04:01.220
"rule using partial derivatives,
and this",00:04:01.220,00:04:04.870
"knowledge to now solve a certain
class of differential",00:04:04.870,00:04:09.060
"equations, first order
differential equations, called",00:04:09.060,00:04:13.060
exact equations.,00:04:13.060,00:04:14.270
"And what does an exact
equation look like?",00:04:14.270,00:04:17.860
"An exact equation
looks like this.",00:04:17.860,00:04:21.990
"The color picking's
the hard part.",00:04:21.990,00:04:23.710
"So let's say this is my
differential equation.",00:04:23.710,00:04:26.290
"I have some function
of x and y.",00:04:26.290,00:04:29.550
"So I don't know, it could
be x squared times",00:04:29.550,00:04:31.830
cosine of y or something.,00:04:31.830,00:04:32.920
"I don't know, it could be
any function of x and y.",00:04:32.920,00:04:34.650
"Plus some function of x and y,
we'll call that n, times dy,",00:04:34.650,00:04:40.350
dx is equal to 0.,00:04:40.350,00:04:44.900
"This is-- well, I don't know if
it's an exact equation yet,",00:04:44.900,00:04:47.520
"but if you saw something of this
form, your first impulse",00:04:47.520,00:04:50.880
"should be, oh-- well, actually,
your very first",00:04:50.880,00:04:52.990
"impulse is, is this separable?",00:04:52.990,00:04:54.500
"And you should try to play
around with the algebra a",00:04:54.500,00:04:56.180
"little bit to see if it's
separable, because that's",00:04:56.180,00:04:57.620
"always the most straightforward
way.",00:04:57.620,00:04:59.210
"If it's not separable, but you
can still put it in this form,",00:04:59.210,00:05:01.770
"you say, hey, is it
an exact equation?",00:05:01.770,00:05:04.460
And what's an exact equation?,00:05:04.460,00:05:06.340
"Well, look immediately.",00:05:06.340,00:05:07.270
"This pattern right here
looks an awful",00:05:07.270,00:05:11.600
lot like this pattern.,00:05:11.600,00:05:14.000
"What if M was the partial of
psi, with respect to x?",00:05:14.000,00:05:18.210
"What if psi, with respect
to x, is equal to M?",00:05:18.210,00:05:24.920
"What if this was psi,
with respect to x?",00:05:24.920,00:05:26.710
"And what if this was psi,
with respect to y?",00:05:26.710,00:05:29.570
"So psi, with respect to
y, is equal to N.",00:05:29.570,00:05:32.500
What if?,00:05:32.500,00:05:32.950
"I'm just saying, we don't
know for sure, right?",00:05:32.950,00:05:34.670
"If you just see this someplace
randomly, you won't know for",00:05:34.670,00:05:37.500
"sure that this is the partial
of, with respect to x of some",00:05:37.500,00:05:40.200
"function, and this is the
partial, with respect to y of",00:05:40.200,00:05:43.060
some function.,00:05:43.060,00:05:43.830
"But we're just saying,
what if?",00:05:43.830,00:05:45.810
"If this were true, then we
could rewrite this as the",00:05:45.810,00:05:49.650
"partial of psi, with respect to
x, plus the partial of psi,",00:05:49.650,00:05:52.870
"with respect to y, times
dy, dx, equal to 0.",00:05:52.870,00:05:58.680
"And this right here, the left
side right there, that's the",00:05:58.680,00:06:02.050
"same thing as this, right?",00:06:02.050,00:06:04.790
"This is just the derivative of
psi, with respect to x, using",00:06:04.790,00:06:09.040
"the partial derivative
chain rule.",00:06:09.040,00:06:10.940
So you could rewrite it.,00:06:10.940,00:06:12.710
"You could rewrite, this is just
the derivative of psi,",00:06:12.710,00:06:17.130
"with respect to x, inside
the function of x,",00:06:17.130,00:06:20.480
"y, is equal to 0.",00:06:20.480,00:06:23.410
"So if you see a differential
equation, and it has this",00:06:23.410,00:06:27.730
"form, and you say, boy, I can't
separate it, but maybe",00:06:27.730,00:06:31.070
it's an exact equation.,00:06:31.070,00:06:32.030
"And frankly, if that was what
was recently covered before",00:06:32.030,00:06:35.940
"the current exam, it probably
is an exact equation.",00:06:35.940,00:06:38.800
"But if you see this form,
you say, boy, maybe",00:06:38.800,00:06:40.940
it's an exact equation.,00:06:40.940,00:06:42.070
"If it is an exact equation-- and
I'll show you how to test",00:06:42.070,00:06:44.580
"it in a second using this
information-- then this can be",00:06:44.580,00:06:48.350
"written as the derivative of
some function, psi, where this",00:06:48.350,00:06:52.550
"is the partial of psi,
with respect to x.",00:06:52.550,00:06:54.840
"This is the partial of psi,
with respect to y.",00:06:54.840,00:06:57.720
"And then if you could write it
like this, and you take the",00:06:57.720,00:06:59.655
"derivative of both sides--
sorry, you take the",00:06:59.655,00:07:01.370
"antiderivative of both sides--
and you would get psi of x, y",00:07:01.370,00:07:06.890
is equal to c as a solution.,00:07:06.890,00:07:10.070
"So there are two things that we
should be caring you about.",00:07:10.070,00:07:12.770
"Then you might be saying, OK,
Sal, you've walked through",00:07:12.770,00:07:16.470
"psi's, and partials,
and all this.",00:07:16.470,00:07:19.550
"One, how do I know that it's
an exact equation?",00:07:19.550,00:07:22.020
"And then, if it is an exact
equation, which tells us that",00:07:22.020,00:07:24.590
"there is some psi, then how
do I solve for the psi?",00:07:24.590,00:07:28.290
"So the way to figure out is it
an exact equation, is to use",00:07:28.290,00:07:32.380
this information right here.,00:07:32.380,00:07:34.690
"We know that if psi and its
derivatives are continuous",00:07:34.690,00:07:38.150
"over some domain, that when
you take the partial, with",00:07:38.150,00:07:42.100
"respect to x and then y, that's
the same thing as doing",00:07:42.100,00:07:45.760
it in the other order.,00:07:45.760,00:07:46.980
"So we said, this is
the partial, with",00:07:46.980,00:07:48.930
"respect to x, right?",00:07:48.930,00:07:50.180
"And this is the partial,
with respect to y.",00:07:52.610,00:07:55.920
"So if this is an exact equation,
if this is the exact",00:07:55.920,00:07:59.880
"equation, if we were take the
partial of this, with respect",00:07:59.880,00:08:03.250
"to y, right?",00:08:03.250,00:08:05.330
"If we were to take the partial
of M, with respect to y-- so",00:08:05.330,00:08:11.600
"the partial of psi, with respect
to x, is equal to M.",00:08:11.600,00:08:15.560
"If we were to take the partial
of those, with respect to y--",00:08:15.560,00:08:18.490
"so we could just rewrite that as
that-- then that should be",00:08:18.490,00:08:22.450
"equal to the partial of N,
with respect to x, right?",00:08:22.450,00:08:28.090
"The partial of psi, with respect
to y, is equal to N.",00:08:28.090,00:08:31.976
"So if we take the partial, with
respect to x, of both of",00:08:31.976,00:08:34.760
"these, we know from this that
these should be equal, if psi",00:08:34.760,00:08:40.964
"and its partials are continuous
over that domain.",00:08:40.964,00:08:44.400
"So then this will
also be equal.",00:08:44.400,00:08:49.320
"So that is actually the
test to test if",00:08:49.320,00:08:51.990
this is an exact equation.,00:08:51.990,00:08:53.930
"So let me rewrite all of that
again and summarize it a",00:08:53.930,00:08:56.300
little bit.,00:08:56.300,00:08:56.690
"So if you see something of the
form, M of x, y plus N of x,",00:08:56.690,00:09:04.870
"y, times dy, dx is equal to 0.",00:09:04.870,00:09:09.580
"And then you take the partial
derivative of M, with respect",00:09:09.580,00:09:13.110
"to y, and then you take the
partial derivative of N, with",00:09:13.110,00:09:18.280
"respect to x, and they are equal
to each other, then--",00:09:18.280,00:09:24.030
"and it's actually if and only
if, so it goes both ways--",00:09:24.030,00:09:26.410
"this is an exact equation, an
exact differential equation.",00:09:26.410,00:09:30.930
This is an exact equation.,00:09:30.930,00:09:32.410
"And if it's an exact equation,
that tells us that there",00:09:32.410,00:09:35.510
"exists a psi, such that the
derivative of psi of x, y is",00:09:35.510,00:09:47.140
"equal to 0, or psi of x, y is
equal to c, is a solution of",00:09:47.140,00:09:52.200
this equation.,00:09:52.200,00:09:53.050
"And the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to x, is",00:09:53.050,00:09:58.480
equal to M.,00:09:58.480,00:09:59.740
"And the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to y, is",00:09:59.740,00:10:03.760
equal to N.,00:10:03.760,00:10:05.340
"And I'll show you in the next
video how to actually use this",00:10:05.340,00:10:07.550
information to solve for psi.,00:10:07.550,00:10:09.810
