"We hopefully know at this point
what a differential",00:00:00.790,00:00:03.330
"equation is, so now let's
try to solve some.",00:00:03.330,00:00:06.490
"And this first class of
differential equations I'll",00:00:06.490,00:00:09.000
"introduce you to, they're called
separable equations.",00:00:09.000,00:00:11.270
"And I think what you'll find
is that we're not learning",00:00:11.270,00:00:13.570
really anything new.,00:00:13.570,00:00:14.420
"Using just your first year
calculus derivative and",00:00:14.420,00:00:19.010
"integrating skills, you can
solve a separable equation.",00:00:19.010,00:00:22.300
"And the reason why they're
called separable is because",00:00:22.300,00:00:25.240
"you can actually separate the
x and y terms, and integrate",00:00:25.240,00:00:28.090
"them separately to get
the solution of the",00:00:28.090,00:00:30.330
differential equation.,00:00:30.330,00:00:31.170
So that's separable.,00:00:31.170,00:00:33.640
Separable equations.,00:00:33.640,00:00:36.000
"So let's do a couple, and I
think you'll get the point.",00:00:36.000,00:00:38.550
"These often are really more of
exercises in algebra than",00:00:38.550,00:00:42.600
anything else.,00:00:42.600,00:00:44.120
"So the first separable
differential equation is: dy",00:00:44.120,00:00:49.110
"over dx is equal to x squared
over 1 minus y squared.",00:00:49.110,00:00:56.710
"And actually, this is a good
time to just review our",00:00:56.710,00:00:58.420
terminology.,00:00:58.420,00:00:59.050
"So first of all, what
is the order of this",00:00:59.050,00:01:00.840
differential equation?,00:01:00.840,00:01:02.060
"Well, the highest derivative
in it is just the first",00:01:02.060,00:01:05.090
"derivative, so the order
is equal to 1.",00:01:05.090,00:01:08.430
So it's first order.,00:01:08.430,00:01:11.390
"It's ordinary, because we only
have a regular derivative, no",00:01:11.390,00:01:14.020
partial derivatives here.,00:01:14.020,00:01:15.530
"And then, is this linear
or non-linear?",00:01:15.530,00:01:18.130
"Well, first you say, oh well,
you know, this looks linear.",00:01:18.130,00:01:20.580
"I'm not multiplying
the derivative",00:01:20.580,00:01:21.910
times anything else.,00:01:21.910,00:01:23.050
"But if you look carefully,
something",00:01:23.050,00:01:25.280
interesting is going on.,00:01:25.280,00:01:26.160
"First of all, you have
a y squared.",00:01:26.160,00:01:28.100
And y is a dependent variable.,00:01:28.100,00:01:29.610
y is a function of x.,00:01:29.610,00:01:31.440
"So to have the y squared, that
makes it non-linear.",00:01:31.440,00:01:33.740
"And even if this was a y, if you
were to actually multiply",00:01:33.740,00:01:36.660
"both sides of this equation
times 1 minus y, and get in",00:01:36.660,00:01:39.280
"the form that I showed you in
the previous equation, you",00:01:39.280,00:01:42.740
would have 1 minus y squared.,00:01:42.740,00:01:47.060
"This is actually the first step
of what we have to do",00:01:47.060,00:01:48.630
"anyways, so I'll
write it down.",00:01:48.630,00:01:50.150
"So if I'm just multiplying both
sides of this equation",00:01:50.150,00:01:52.020
"times 1 minus y squared, you get
1 minus y squared times dy",00:01:52.020,00:01:56.620
dx is equal to x squared.,00:01:56.620,00:02:00.820
"And then you immediately see
that even if this wasn't a",00:02:00.820,00:02:04.120
"squared here, you'd be
multiplying the y times dy dx,",00:02:04.120,00:02:07.020
"and that also makes it
non-linear because you're",00:02:07.020,00:02:09.770
"multiplying the dependent
variable times the",00:02:09.770,00:02:11.640
derivative of itself.,00:02:11.640,00:02:12.690
"So that also makes this
a non-linear equation.",00:02:12.690,00:02:14.890
"But anyway, let's get back
to solving this.",00:02:14.890,00:02:17.300
So this is the first step.,00:02:17.300,00:02:18.690
"I just multiply both sides
by 1 minus y squared.",00:02:18.690,00:02:21.480
"And the real end goal is just
to separate the y's and the",00:02:21.480,00:02:24.310
"x's, and then integrate
both sides.",00:02:24.310,00:02:26.200
So I'm almost there.,00:02:26.200,00:02:27.450
"So now what I want to do is I
want to multiply both sides of",00:02:27.450,00:02:29.720
"this equation times dx, so I
have a dx here and get rid of",00:02:29.720,00:02:32.940
this dx there.,00:02:32.940,00:02:34.375
"Let me go here, I don't want
to waste too much space.",00:02:34.375,00:02:37.790
"So you get 1 minus y squared dy
is equal to x squared dx.",00:02:37.790,00:02:47.440
"I have separated the x and
y variables and the",00:02:47.440,00:02:51.190
differentials.,00:02:51.190,00:02:52.420
"All I did is I multiplied both
sides of this equation times",00:02:52.420,00:02:54.510
dx to get here.,00:02:54.510,00:02:56.850
"Now, I can just integrate
both sides.",00:02:56.850,00:03:00.160
So let's do that.,00:03:00.160,00:03:01.680
"Whatever you do to one side
of the equation you",00:03:01.680,00:03:03.080
have to do the other.,00:03:03.080,00:03:04.930
"That's true with regular
equations or",00:03:04.930,00:03:06.790
differential equations.,00:03:06.790,00:03:07.560
"So we're going to integrate
both sides.",00:03:07.560,00:03:09.180
"So what's the integral of this
expression with respect to y?",00:03:09.180,00:03:12.640
Let's see.,00:03:12.640,00:03:13.350
"The integral of 1 is y, the
integral of y squared, well",00:03:13.350,00:03:19.730
"that's minus y to the
third over 3.",00:03:19.730,00:03:27.210
"And I'll write the plus c here
just to kind of show you",00:03:27.210,00:03:30.230
"something, but you really don't
have to write a plus c",00:03:30.230,00:03:32.730
on both sides.,00:03:32.730,00:03:34.020
"I'll call the plus the
constant due to y.",00:03:34.020,00:03:37.145
The y integration.,00:03:37.145,00:03:38.750
"You'll never see this in a
calculus class, but I just",00:03:38.750,00:03:40.420
want to make a point here.,00:03:40.420,00:03:41.670
"I just want to show you that
our plus c has never",00:03:44.290,00:03:45.840
"disappeared from when we were
taking our traditional",00:03:45.840,00:03:47.720
antiderivatives.,00:03:47.720,00:03:48.780
"And what's the derivative
of this?",00:03:48.780,00:03:50.030
"Well that's x to the
third over 3.",00:03:50.030,00:03:52.420
"And this is also going
to have a plus c",00:03:57.010,00:04:01.300
due to the x variable.,00:04:01.300,00:04:03.600
"Now, the reason why I did this
magenta one in magenta and I",00:04:03.600,00:04:07.390
"labelled it like that, is
because you really just have",00:04:07.390,00:04:09.070
"to write a plus c on one
side of the equation.",00:04:09.070,00:04:11.380
"And if that doesn't make a lot
of sense, let's subtract this",00:04:11.380,00:04:13.900
"c from both sides, and we get y
minus-- let me scroll down a",00:04:13.900,00:04:19.740
"little bit, my y
looks like a g.",00:04:19.740,00:04:22.650
"y minus y to the third over 3
is equal to x to the third",00:04:22.650,00:04:29.370
"over 3 plus the constant when we
took the antiderivative of",00:04:29.370,00:04:33.270
"the x, minus the constant of
the antiderivative when we",00:04:33.270,00:04:36.380
took the y.,00:04:36.380,00:04:37.450
"But these two constants,
they're just constants.",00:04:37.450,00:04:39.500
"I mean, we don't know
what they are.",00:04:39.500,00:04:40.480
There are arbitrary constants.,00:04:40.480,00:04:41.430
"So we could just write
a general c here.",00:04:41.430,00:04:43.170
"So you could have just-- you
have to have a constant, but",00:04:43.170,00:04:46.170
"it doesn't have to be on both
sides of the equation, because",00:04:46.170,00:04:48.310
they're arbitrary.,00:04:48.310,00:04:49.580
"cx minus cy, well, that's still
just another constant.",00:04:49.580,00:04:52.140
"And then if we want to simplify
this equation more,",00:04:52.140,00:04:53.900
"we can multiply both sides
of this by 3, just",00:04:53.900,00:04:56.230
make it look nicer.,00:04:56.230,00:04:57.430
"And you get 3y minus y to the
third is equal to x to the",00:04:57.430,00:05:04.510
"third plus-- well, I could
write 3c here.",00:05:04.510,00:05:08.580
"But once again, c is an
arbitrary constant.",00:05:08.580,00:05:11.190
"So 3 times an arbitrary
constant, that's just another",00:05:11.190,00:05:13.570
arbitrary constant.,00:05:13.570,00:05:14.555
So I'll write the c there.,00:05:14.555,00:05:18.610
And there you have it.,00:05:18.610,00:05:19.690
"We have solved this differential
equation.",00:05:19.690,00:05:22.460
"Although it is in implicit
form right now, and it's",00:05:22.460,00:05:25.520
"fairly hard to get it out
of implicit form.",00:05:25.520,00:05:28.290
"We could put the c on one side,
so the solution could be",00:05:28.290,00:05:31.550
"3y minus y to the third minus x
to the third is equal to c.",00:05:31.550,00:05:37.180
"Some people might like that
little bit better.",00:05:37.180,00:05:38.660
But that's the solution.,00:05:38.660,00:05:39.900
"And notice, the solution, just
like when you take an",00:05:39.900,00:05:41.780
"antiderivative, the solution
is a class of implicit",00:05:41.780,00:05:46.930
"functions, in this case.",00:05:46.930,00:05:48.230
And why is it a class?,00:05:48.230,00:05:49.320
"Because we have that
constant there.",00:05:49.320,00:05:51.520
"Depending on what number
you pick there, it",00:05:51.520,00:05:55.090
will be another solution.,00:05:55.090,00:05:56.360
"But any constant there will
satisfy the original",00:05:56.360,00:05:59.440
"differential equation,
which was up here.",00:05:59.440,00:06:03.780
"This was the original
differential equation.",00:06:03.780,00:06:05.540
"And if you want to solve for
that constant, someone has to",00:06:05.540,00:06:08.370
give you an initial condition.,00:06:08.370,00:06:09.630
"Someone has to say, well,
when x is 2, y is 3.",00:06:09.630,00:06:15.860
"And then you could
solve for c.",00:06:15.860,00:06:17.920
"Anyway, let's do another
one that gives",00:06:17.920,00:06:19.880
us an initial condition.,00:06:19.880,00:06:22.950
"So this one's a little bit--
I'll start over.",00:06:22.950,00:06:27.180
"Clear image, different colors,
so I have optimal space.",00:06:27.180,00:06:31.990
"So this one is the first
derivative of y with respect",00:06:31.990,00:06:36.690
"to x is equal to 3x squared
plus 4x plus 2 over 2",00:06:36.690,00:06:49.940
times y minus 1.,00:06:49.940,00:06:52.100
"This is a parentheses, not
an absolute value.",00:06:52.100,00:06:54.030
"And they give us initial
conditions.",00:06:54.030,00:06:56.280
"They say that y of 0 is
equal to negative 1.",00:06:56.280,00:07:00.640
"So once we solve this
differential equation, and",00:07:00.640,00:07:03.010
"this is a separable differential
equation, then we",00:07:03.010,00:07:05.860
"can use this initial condition,
when x is 0, y is",00:07:05.860,00:07:08.830
"1, to figure out the constant.",00:07:08.830,00:07:10.520
"So let's first separate
this equation.",00:07:10.520,00:07:12.220
"So let's multiply both sides
by 2 times y minus 1.",00:07:12.220,00:07:15.610
"And you get 2 times y minus 1
times dy dx is equal to 3x",00:07:15.610,00:07:25.340
squared plus 4x plus 2.,00:07:25.340,00:07:28.620
Multiply both sides times dx.,00:07:28.620,00:07:30.040
"This is really just an
exercise in algebra.",00:07:30.040,00:07:33.560
"And I can multiply this one out,
too, you get 2y minus 2,",00:07:33.560,00:07:39.030
"that's just this, dy.",00:07:39.030,00:07:40.940
"I multiplied both sides times
dx, so that equals 3x squared",00:07:40.940,00:07:47.390
plus 4x plus 2 dx.,00:07:47.390,00:07:52.730
"I have separated
the equations.",00:07:52.730,00:07:54.740
"I've separated the independent
from the dependent variable,",00:07:54.740,00:07:57.990
"and their relative
differentials, and so now I",00:07:57.990,00:08:00.690
can integrate.,00:08:00.690,00:08:01.570
"And I can integrate
in magenta.",00:08:01.570,00:08:02.840
"What's the antiderivative
of this expression",00:08:06.500,00:08:08.950
with respect to y?,00:08:08.950,00:08:09.650
"Well, let's just see.",00:08:09.650,00:08:10.080
It's y squared minus 2y.,00:08:10.080,00:08:14.100
"I won't write the plus
c, I'll just do it on",00:08:14.100,00:08:15.450
the right hand side.,00:08:15.450,00:08:17.200
That is equal to 3x squared.,00:08:17.200,00:08:19.995
"Well, the antiderivative is x to
the third, plus 2x squared,",00:08:19.995,00:08:25.400
plus 2x plus c.,00:08:25.400,00:08:29.580
"And that c kind of takes care of
the constant for both sides",00:08:29.580,00:08:32.010
"of the equation, and hopefully
you understand why from the",00:08:32.010,00:08:34.159
last example.,00:08:34.159,00:08:35.080
"But we can solve for c using the
initial condition y of 0",00:08:35.080,00:08:39.270
is equal to negative 1.,00:08:39.270,00:08:41.480
So let's see.,00:08:41.480,00:08:42.870
"When x is 0, y is negative 1.",00:08:42.870,00:08:44.950
"So let's put y as negative 1,
so we get negative 1 squared",00:08:44.950,00:08:50.090
"minus 2 times negative 1, that's
the value of y, is",00:08:50.090,00:08:55.870
equal to when x is equal to 0.,00:08:55.870,00:08:57.500
"So when x is equal to 0, that's
0 to the third plus 2",00:08:57.500,00:09:00.890
"times 0 squared plus
2 times 0 plus c.",00:09:00.890,00:09:04.760
"So this is fairly
straightforward.",00:09:04.760,00:09:06.260
"All of these, this is all 0.",00:09:06.260,00:09:09.280
"This is, let's see, negative
1 squared, that's 1.",00:09:09.280,00:09:14.940
"Minus 2 times minus 1, that's
plus 2, is equal to c.",00:09:14.940,00:09:20.600
And we get c is equal to 3.,00:09:20.600,00:09:25.170
"So, the implicit exact solution,
the solution of our",00:09:25.170,00:09:28.710
"differential equation-- remember
now, it's not a",00:09:28.710,00:09:30.080
"class, because they gave us an
initial condition-- is y",00:09:30.080,00:09:35.880
"squared minus 2y is equal to x
to the third plus 2x squared",00:09:35.880,00:09:43.170
plus 2x plus 3.,00:09:43.170,00:09:46.260
"We figured out that's
what c was.",00:09:46.260,00:09:48.730
"And actually, if you want, you
could write this in an",00:09:48.730,00:09:50.460
"explicit form by completing
the square.",00:09:50.460,00:09:52.800
"This is just algebra
this point.",00:09:52.800,00:09:54.180
You're done.,00:09:54.180,00:09:54.510
This is an implicit form.,00:09:54.510,00:09:55.450
"If you wanted to make it
explicit, you could add 1 to",00:09:55.450,00:09:58.450
both sides.,00:09:58.450,00:09:58.890
"I'm just completing
the square here.",00:09:58.890,00:10:00.660
So y squared minus 2y plus 1.,00:10:00.660,00:10:04.480
"If I add 1 to that side, I have
to add 1 to this side, so",00:10:04.480,00:10:07.060
"it becomes x to the third plus
2x squared plus 2x plus 4.",00:10:07.060,00:10:13.090
"I just added 1 to both sides
of the equation.",00:10:13.090,00:10:14.940
Why did I do that?,00:10:14.940,00:10:15.770
"Because I wanted this
side to be a perfect",00:10:15.770,00:10:17.680
square in terms of y.,00:10:17.680,00:10:19.240
"Then I can rewrite this side as
y minus 1 squared is equal",00:10:19.240,00:10:24.590
"to x to the third plus 2x
squared plus 2x plus 4.",00:10:24.590,00:10:30.500
"Then I could say y minus 1 is
equal to the plus or minus",00:10:30.500,00:10:35.110
"square root of x to the
third plus 2x squared",00:10:35.110,00:10:39.950
plus 2x plus 4.,00:10:39.950,00:10:43.210
"I can add 1 to both sides, and
then I can get y is equal to 1",00:10:43.210,00:10:46.520
"plus or minus the square root
of x to the third plus 2x",00:10:46.520,00:10:52.080
squared plus 2x plus 4.,00:10:52.080,00:10:55.926
"And it has plus or minus here,
and if we have to pick one of",00:10:55.926,00:10:58.470
"the two, we'd go back to
the initial condition.",00:10:58.470,00:11:00.335
"Well, our initial condition told
us that y of 0 is equal",00:11:02.860,00:11:08.800
to negative 1.,00:11:08.800,00:11:10.200
"So if we put 0 here for x, we
get y is equal to 1 plus or",00:11:10.200,00:11:16.710
minus 0 plus 4.,00:11:16.710,00:11:19.065
So 1 plus or minus 4.,00:11:19.065,00:11:22.100
"So if y is going to be equal to
negative 1, so we get y is",00:11:22.100,00:11:24.740
"equal to 1 plus or
minus-- sorry, 2.",00:11:24.740,00:11:28.580
"If this is going to be equal to
negative 1, then this has",00:11:28.580,00:11:32.090
to be 1 minus 2.,00:11:32.090,00:11:33.830
"So the explicit form that
satisfies our initial",00:11:33.830,00:11:37.160
"condition, and we're getting a
little geeky here, you could",00:11:37.160,00:11:39.490
"get rid of the plus, it's 1
minus this whole thing.",00:11:39.490,00:11:42.970
"That's what satisfies our
initial condition.",00:11:42.970,00:11:45.340
"And you could figure out where
it's satisfied, over what",00:11:45.340,00:11:49.430
domain is it satisfied.,00:11:49.430,00:11:50.910
"Well, that's satisfied when this
term is positive, this",00:11:50.910,00:11:53.300
"becomes negative, and you get
it's undefined in reals, and",00:11:53.300,00:11:56.130
all of that.,00:11:56.130,00:11:56.470
"But anyway, I've run
out of time.",00:11:56.470,00:11:57.950
