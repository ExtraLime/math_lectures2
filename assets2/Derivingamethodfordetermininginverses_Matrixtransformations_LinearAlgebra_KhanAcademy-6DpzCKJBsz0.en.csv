"I have this matrix A here that I
want to put into reduced row",00:00:00.680,00:00:04.510
echelon form.,00:00:04.510,00:00:05.450
"And we've done this
multiple times.",00:00:05.450,00:00:07.160
"You just perform a bunch
of row operations.",00:00:07.160,00:00:09.670
"But what I want to show you in
this video is that those row",00:00:09.670,00:00:12.470
"operations are equivalent to
linear transformations on the",00:00:12.470,00:00:16.520
column vectors of A.,00:00:16.520,00:00:19.450
So let me show you by example.,00:00:19.450,00:00:21.490
"So if we just want to put A into
reduced row echelon form,",00:00:21.490,00:00:24.450
"the first step that we might
want to do if we wanted to",00:00:24.450,00:00:26.860
"zero out these entries right
here, is-- let me do it right",00:00:26.860,00:00:31.580
"here-- is we'll keep our
first entry the same.",00:00:31.580,00:00:34.890
"So for each of these column
vectors, we're going to keep",00:00:34.890,00:00:36.830
the first entry the same.,00:00:36.830,00:00:38.010
"So they're going to be
1, minus 1, minus 1.",00:00:38.010,00:00:41.590
"And actually, let me
simultaneously construct my",00:00:41.590,00:00:44.360
transformation.,00:00:44.360,00:00:45.800
"So I'm saying that my row
operation I'm going to perform",00:00:45.800,00:00:48.340
"is equivalent to a linear
transformation",00:00:48.340,00:00:51.690
on the column vector.,00:00:51.690,00:00:52.630
"So it's going to be a
transformation that's going to",00:00:52.630,00:00:55.160
"take some column vector,
a1, a2, and a3.",00:00:55.160,00:01:00.880
"It's going to take each of these
and then do something to",00:01:00.880,00:01:03.130
"them, do something to them
in a linear way.",00:01:03.130,00:01:05.239
"They'll be linear
transformations.",00:01:05.239,00:01:07.330
"So we're keeping the
first entry of our",00:01:07.330,00:01:09.470
column vector the same.,00:01:09.470,00:01:11.090
"So this is just going
to be a1.",00:01:11.090,00:01:14.670
This is a line right here.,00:01:14.670,00:01:16.330
That's going to be a1.,00:01:16.330,00:01:17.250
"Now, what can we do if
we want to get to",00:01:17.250,00:01:19.050
reduced row echelon form?,00:01:19.050,00:01:20.780
"We'd want to make
this equal to 0.",00:01:20.780,00:01:22.610
"So we would want to replace our
second row with the second",00:01:22.610,00:01:26.360
"row plus the first row, because
then these guys would",00:01:26.360,00:01:29.230
turn out to be 0.,00:01:29.230,00:01:30.500
"So let me write that on
my transformation.",00:01:30.500,00:01:32.140
"I'm going to replace the second
row with the second row",00:01:32.140,00:01:35.490
plus the first row.,00:01:35.490,00:01:39.090
Let me write it out here.,00:01:39.090,00:01:40.400
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.,00:01:40.400,00:01:43.410
2 plus minus 1 is 1.,00:01:43.410,00:01:45.810
3 plus minus 1 is 2.,00:01:45.810,00:01:48.950
"Now, we also want
to get a 0 here.",00:01:48.950,00:01:51.070
"So let me replace my third
row with my third row",00:01:51.070,00:01:54.360
minus my first row.,00:01:54.360,00:01:55.900
"So I'm going to replace my third
row with my third row",00:01:55.900,00:01:59.320
minus my first row.,00:01:59.320,00:02:01.690
So 1 minus 1 is 0.,00:02:01.690,00:02:05.240
1 minus minus 1 is 2.,00:02:05.240,00:02:08.660
"4 minus minus 1 is 5,
just like that.",00:02:08.660,00:02:14.100
"So you see this was just a
linear transformation.",00:02:14.100,00:02:16.790
"And any linear transformation
you could actually represent",00:02:16.790,00:02:19.390
as a matrix vector product.,00:02:19.390,00:02:22.280
"So for example, this
transformation, I could",00:02:22.280,00:02:24.140
represent it.,00:02:24.140,00:02:26.150
"To figure out its transformation
matrix, so if",00:02:26.150,00:02:28.230
"we say that T of x is equal to,
I don't know, let's call",00:02:28.230,00:02:32.600
it some matrix S times x.,00:02:32.600,00:02:36.220
We already used the matrix A.,00:02:36.220,00:02:37.740
"So I have to pick
another letter.",00:02:37.740,00:02:40.110
So how do we find S?,00:02:40.110,00:02:41.160
"Well, we just apply the
transformation to all of the",00:02:41.160,00:02:43.570
"column vectors, or the standard
basis vectors of the",00:02:43.570,00:02:46.370
identity matrix.,00:02:46.370,00:02:47.240
So let's do that.,00:02:47.240,00:02:48.460
"So the identity matrix-- I'll
draw it really small like",00:02:48.460,00:02:50.760
"this-- the identity matrix looks
like this, 1, 0, 0, 0,",00:02:50.760,00:02:55.080
"1, 0, 0, 0, 1.",00:02:55.080,00:02:57.900
"That's what that identity
matrix looks like.",00:02:57.900,00:02:59.880
"To find the transformation
matrix, we just apply this guy",00:02:59.880,00:03:02.580
"to each of the column
vectors of this.",00:03:02.580,00:03:04.660
So what do we get?,00:03:04.660,00:03:06.286
"I'll do it a little
bit bigger.",00:03:06.286,00:03:09.270
"We apply it to each of
these column vectors.",00:03:09.270,00:03:11.140
"But we see the first row
always stays the same.",00:03:11.140,00:03:13.370
"So the first row is always going
to be the same thing.",00:03:13.370,00:03:16.250
"So 1, 0, 0.",00:03:16.250,00:03:18.850
"I'm essentially applying it
simultaneously to each of",00:03:18.850,00:03:21.180
"these column vectors, saying,
look, when you transform each",00:03:21.180,00:03:24.290
"of these column vectors, their
first entry stays the same.",00:03:24.290,00:03:27.710
"The second entry becomes
the second entry",00:03:27.710,00:03:31.890
plus the first entry.,00:03:31.890,00:03:32.910
So 0 plus 1 is 1.,00:03:32.910,00:03:35.730
1 plus 0 is 1.,00:03:35.730,00:03:38.510
0 plus 0 is 0.,00:03:38.510,00:03:41.350
"Then the third entry gets
replaced with the third entry",00:03:41.350,00:03:45.440
minus the first entry.,00:03:45.440,00:03:46.690
So 0 minus 1 is minus 1.,00:03:46.690,00:03:49.660
0 minus 0 is 0.,00:03:49.660,00:03:52.500
1 minus 0 is 1.,00:03:52.500,00:03:54.930
"Now notice, when I apply this
transformation to the column",00:03:54.930,00:03:58.510
"vectors of our identity matrix,
I essentially just",00:03:58.510,00:04:02.010
"performed those same
row operations",00:04:02.010,00:04:03.760
that I did up there.,00:04:03.760,00:04:04.730
"I performed those exact same
row operations on this",00:04:04.730,00:04:07.160
identity matrix.,00:04:07.160,00:04:08.330
"But we know that this is
actually the transformation",00:04:08.330,00:04:10.520
"matrix, that if we multiply
it by each of these column",00:04:10.520,00:04:13.110
"vectors, or by each of these
column vectors, we're going to",00:04:13.110,00:04:16.769
get these column vectors.,00:04:16.769,00:04:18.430
So you can view it this way.,00:04:18.430,00:04:20.240
"This right here, this
is equal to S.",00:04:20.240,00:04:22.990
"This is our transformation
matrix.",00:04:22.990,00:04:25.510
"So we could say that if we
create a new matrix whose",00:04:25.510,00:04:32.350
"columns are S times this column
vector, S times 1,",00:04:32.350,00:04:37.320
"minus 1, 1.",00:04:37.320,00:04:39.420
"And then the next column is S
times-- I wanted to do it in",00:04:39.420,00:04:47.540
"that other color-- S times
this guy, minus 1, 2, 1.",00:04:47.540,00:04:54.670
"And then the third column is
going to be S times this third",00:04:54.670,00:05:02.930
"column vector, minus 1, 3, 4.",00:05:02.930,00:05:09.180
"We now know we're applying this
transformation, this is",00:05:09.180,00:05:11.950
"S, times each of these
column vectors.",00:05:11.950,00:05:13.920
"That is the matrix
representation of this",00:05:13.920,00:05:15.890
transformation.,00:05:15.890,00:05:17.630
"This guy right here will
be transformed",00:05:17.630,00:05:22.300
to this right here.,00:05:22.300,00:05:25.070
Let me do it down here.,00:05:25.070,00:05:30.580
"I wanted to show that stuff that
I had above here as well.",00:05:30.580,00:05:33.670
"Well, I'll just draw an arrow.",00:05:33.670,00:05:35.310
"That's probably the
simplest thing.",00:05:35.310,00:05:36.440
"This matrix right here
will become that",00:05:36.440,00:05:39.900
matrix right there.,00:05:39.900,00:05:41.430
"So another way you could
write it, this is",00:05:41.430,00:05:43.610
equivalent to what?,00:05:43.610,00:05:44.570
What is this equivalent to?,00:05:44.570,00:05:45.520
"When you take a matrix and you
multiply it times each of the",00:05:45.520,00:05:47.900
"column vectors, when you
transform each of the column",00:05:47.900,00:05:50.400
"vectors by this matrix, this
is the definition of a",00:05:50.400,00:05:53.970
matrix-matrix product.,00:05:53.970,00:05:55.270
"This is equal to our matrix S--
I'll do it in pink-- this",00:05:55.270,00:05:59.440
"is equal to our matrix S, which
is 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,",00:05:59.440,00:06:05.920
"minus 1, 0, 1, times our matrix
A, times 1, minus 1, 1,",00:06:05.920,00:06:15.790
"minus 1, 2, 1, minus 1, 3, 4.",00:06:15.790,00:06:22.090
"So let me make this
very clear.",00:06:22.090,00:06:25.630
"This is our transformation
matrix S.",00:06:25.630,00:06:28.430
This is our matrix A.,00:06:28.430,00:06:30.440
"And when you perform this
product you're going to get",00:06:30.440,00:06:34.130
this guy right over here.,00:06:34.130,00:06:37.720
I'll just copy and paste it.,00:06:37.720,00:06:40.450
"Edit, copy, and let
me paste it.",00:06:40.450,00:06:45.230
"You're going to get that
guy just like that.",00:06:45.230,00:06:48.210
"Now the whole reason why I'm
doing that is just to remind",00:06:48.210,00:06:50.480
"you that when we perform each of
these row operations, we're",00:06:50.480,00:06:53.710
just multiplying.,00:06:53.710,00:06:54.600
"We're performing a linear
transformation on each of",00:06:54.600,00:06:57.170
these columns.,00:06:57.170,00:06:58.090
"And it is completely equivalent
to just multiplying",00:06:58.090,00:07:00.730
this guy by some matrix S.,00:07:00.730,00:07:02.790
"In this case, we took the
trouble of figuring out what",00:07:02.790,00:07:04.710
that matrix S is.,00:07:04.710,00:07:06.150
"But any of these row operations
that we've been",00:07:06.150,00:07:08.550
"doing, you can always represent
them by a matrix",00:07:08.550,00:07:12.300
multiplication.,00:07:12.300,00:07:13.550
"So this leads to a very
interesting idea.",00:07:17.060,00:07:19.045
"When you put something in
reduced row echelon form, let",00:07:22.650,00:07:25.700
me do it up here.,00:07:25.700,00:07:26.950
"Actually, let's just finish what
we started with this guy.",00:07:29.730,00:07:32.180
"Let's put this guy in reduced
row echelon form.",00:07:32.180,00:07:34.230
Let me call this first S.,00:07:37.440,00:07:39.080
Let's call that S1.,00:07:39.080,00:07:40.400
"So this guy right here
is equal to that",00:07:40.400,00:07:42.730
first S1 times A.,00:07:42.730,00:07:46.050
"We already showed that
that's true.",00:07:46.050,00:07:47.580
"Now let's perform another
transformation.",00:07:47.580,00:07:50.040
"Let's just do another set of
row operations to get us to",00:07:50.040,00:07:53.170
reduced row echelon form.,00:07:53.170,00:07:55.000
"So let's keep our middle
row the same, 0, 1, 2.",00:07:55.000,00:07:58.860
"And let's replace the first row
with the first row plus",00:07:58.860,00:08:02.190
"the second row, because I
want to make this a 0.",00:08:02.190,00:08:04.630
So 1 plus 0 is 1.,00:08:04.630,00:08:06.980
Let me do it in another color.,00:08:06.980,00:08:10.310
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.,00:08:10.310,00:08:12.810
Minus 1 plus 2 is 1.,00:08:12.810,00:08:15.620
"Now, I want to replace the third
row with, let's say the",00:08:15.620,00:08:21.640
"third row minus 2 times
the first row.",00:08:21.640,00:08:28.210
"So that's 0 minus 2,
times 0, is 0.",00:08:28.210,00:08:31.300
"2 minus 2, times 1, is 0.",00:08:31.300,00:08:33.820
"5 minus 2, times 2, is 1.",00:08:33.820,00:08:37.350
5 minus 4 is 1.,00:08:37.350,00:08:40.130
We're almost there.,00:08:40.130,00:08:41.549
"We just have to zero out
these guys right there.",00:08:41.549,00:08:44.870
"Let's see if we can get this
into reduced row echelon form.",00:08:44.870,00:08:47.220
So what is this?,00:08:47.220,00:08:47.900
"I just performed another
linear transformation.",00:08:47.900,00:08:49.880
"Actually, let me write this.",00:08:49.880,00:08:50.800
"Let's say if this was our first
linear transformation,",00:08:50.800,00:08:53.710
"what I just did is I performed
another linear",00:08:53.710,00:08:55.390
"transformation, T2.",00:08:55.390,00:08:56.660
"I'll write it in a different
notation, where you give me",00:08:56.660,00:08:59.940
"some vector, some column
vector, x1, x2, x3.",00:08:59.940,00:09:04.100
What did I just do?,00:09:04.100,00:09:05.650
"What was the transformation
that I just performed?",00:09:05.650,00:09:08.390
"My new vector, I made the top
row equal to the top row plus",00:09:08.390,00:09:12.380
the second row.,00:09:12.380,00:09:13.325
So it's x1 plus x2.,00:09:13.325,00:09:15.690
"I kept the second
row the same.",00:09:15.690,00:09:17.500
"And then the third row, I
replaced it with the third row",00:09:17.500,00:09:20.580
minus 2 times the second row.,00:09:20.580,00:09:22.920
"That was a linear transformation
we just did.",00:09:22.920,00:09:25.290
"And we could represent this
linear transformation as",00:09:25.290,00:09:27.450
"being, we could say T2 applied
to some vector x is equal to",00:09:27.450,00:09:31.300
"some transformation vector
S2, times our vector x.",00:09:31.300,00:09:36.120
"Because if we applied this
transformation matrix to each",00:09:42.140,00:09:45.340
"of these columns, it's
equivalent to multiplying this",00:09:45.340,00:09:48.590
"guy by this transformation
matrix.",00:09:48.590,00:09:50.940
"So you could say that this guy
right here-- we haven't",00:09:50.940,00:09:53.430
"figured out what this is, but
I think you get the idea--",00:09:53.430,00:09:56.270
"this matrix right here is going
to be equal to this guy.",00:09:56.270,00:09:59.200
"It's going to be equal
to S2 times this guy.",00:09:59.200,00:10:03.310
What is this guy right here?,00:10:03.310,00:10:04.670
"Well, this guy is equal
to S1 times A.",00:10:04.670,00:10:07.805
"It's going to be S2
times S1, times A.",00:10:07.805,00:10:12.510
Fair enough.,00:10:12.510,00:10:13.760
"And you could have gotten
straight here if you just",00:10:16.930,00:10:19.200
multiplied S2 times S1.,00:10:19.200,00:10:20.940
"This could be some
other matrix.",00:10:20.940,00:10:22.250
"If you just multiplied it by
A, you'd go straight from",00:10:22.250,00:10:24.610
there to there.,00:10:24.610,00:10:26.070
Fair enough.,00:10:26.070,00:10:26.670
"Now, we still haven't gotten
this guy into reduced row",00:10:26.670,00:10:28.595
echelon form.,00:10:28.595,00:10:30.010
So let's try to get there.,00:10:30.010,00:10:31.220
"I've run out of space below
him, so I'm going",00:10:31.220,00:10:33.125
to have to go up.,00:10:33.125,00:10:35.270
So let's go upwards.,00:10:35.270,00:10:36.520
"What I want to do is, I'm going
to keep the third row",00:10:40.620,00:10:43.650
"the same, 0, 0, 1.",00:10:43.650,00:10:48.790
"Let me replace the second row
with the second row minus 2",00:10:48.790,00:10:54.700
times the third row.,00:10:54.700,00:10:56.150
"So we'll get a 0, we'll get a 1
minus 2, times 0, and we'll",00:10:56.150,00:10:59.680
"get a 2 minus 2, times 1.",00:10:59.680,00:11:02.250
So that's a 0.,00:11:02.250,00:11:04.100
"Let's replaced the first
row with the first row",00:11:04.100,00:11:06.500
minus the third row.,00:11:06.500,00:11:08.280
So 1 minus 0 is 1.,00:11:08.280,00:11:10.970
0 minus 0 is 0.,00:11:10.970,00:11:13.880
"1 minus 1 is 0, just
like that.",00:11:13.880,00:11:19.310
"Let's just actually write what
our transformation was.",00:11:19.310,00:11:21.470
Let's call it T3.,00:11:21.470,00:11:22.686
I'll do it in purple.,00:11:22.686,00:11:26.490
"T3 is the transformation of some
vector x-- let me write",00:11:26.490,00:11:30.225
"it like this-- of some
vector x1, x2, x3.",00:11:30.225,00:11:34.710
What did we do?,00:11:37.570,00:11:38.290
"We replaced the first row with
the first row minus the third",00:11:38.290,00:11:41.050
"row, x1 minus x3.",00:11:41.050,00:11:44.300
"We replaced the second row with
the second row minus 2",00:11:44.300,00:11:47.580
times the third row.,00:11:47.580,00:11:48.970
So it's x2 minus 2 times x3.,00:11:48.970,00:11:51.870
"Then the third row just
stayed the same.",00:11:51.870,00:11:53.960
"So obviously, this could
also be represented.",00:11:53.960,00:11:57.510
"T3 of x could be equal to some
other transformation matrix,",00:11:57.510,00:12:01.840
S3 times x.,00:12:01.840,00:12:04.230
"So this transformation, when
you multiply it to each of",00:12:04.230,00:12:07.040
"these columns, is equivalent to
multiplying this guy times",00:12:07.040,00:12:12.090
"this transformation matrix,
which we haven't found yet.",00:12:12.090,00:12:14.910
We can write it.,00:12:14.910,00:12:15.560
"So this is going to be equal to
S3 times this matrix right",00:12:15.560,00:12:20.430
"here, which is S2, S1, A.",00:12:20.430,00:12:27.150
And what do we have here?,00:12:27.150,00:12:28.330
We got the identity matrix.,00:12:28.330,00:12:30.000
"We put it in reduced
row echelon form.",00:12:30.000,00:12:32.070
We got the identity matrix.,00:12:32.070,00:12:33.580
"We already know from previous
videos the reduced row echelon",00:12:33.580,00:12:36.530
"form of something is the
identity matrix.",00:12:36.530,00:12:38.750
"Then we are dealing with an
invertible transformation, or",00:12:38.750,00:12:41.830
an invertible matrix.,00:12:41.830,00:12:44.140
"Because this obviously could be
the transformation for some",00:12:44.140,00:12:46.350
transformation.,00:12:46.350,00:12:47.580
"Let's just call this
transformation, I don't know,",00:12:47.580,00:12:51.670
did I already use T?,00:12:51.670,00:12:52.970
"Let's just call it Tnaught for
our transformation applied to",00:12:52.970,00:12:57.420
"some vector x, that might
be equal to Ax.",00:12:57.420,00:13:00.130
"So we know that this
is invertible.",00:13:00.130,00:13:04.390
"We put it in reduced
row echelon form.",00:13:04.390,00:13:06.170
"We put its transformation
matrix in",00:13:06.170,00:13:07.850
reduced row echelon form.,00:13:07.850,00:13:09.560
"And we got the identity
matrix.",00:13:09.560,00:13:11.130
"So that tells us that
this is invertible.",00:13:11.130,00:13:12.880
"But something even more
interesting happened.",00:13:12.880,00:13:14.990
"We got here by performing
some row operations.",00:13:14.990,00:13:18.130
"And we said those row operations
were completely",00:13:18.130,00:13:21.620
"equivalent to multiplying this
guy right here by multiplying",00:13:21.620,00:13:26.080
"our original transformation
matrix by a series of",00:13:26.080,00:13:29.890
"transformation matrices that
represent our row operations.",00:13:29.890,00:13:33.080
"And when we multiplied all this,
this was equal to the",00:13:33.080,00:13:37.150
identity matrix.,00:13:37.150,00:13:38.990
"Now, in the last video we said
that the inverse matrix, so if",00:13:38.990,00:13:43.930
"this is Tnaught, Tnaught inverse
could be represented--",00:13:43.930,00:13:48.450
"it's also a linear
transformation-- It can be",00:13:48.450,00:13:50.850
"represented by some inverse
matrix that we just called A",00:13:50.850,00:13:54.450
inverse times x.,00:13:54.450,00:13:56.070
"And we saw that the inverse
transformation matrix times",00:13:56.070,00:14:02.610
"our transformation matrix is
equal to the identity matrix.",00:14:02.610,00:14:06.580
We saw this last time.,00:14:06.580,00:14:09.540
We proved this to you.,00:14:09.540,00:14:11.060
"Now, something very
interesting here.",00:14:11.060,00:14:12.710
"We have a series of matrix
products times this guy, times",00:14:12.710,00:14:16.750
"this guy, that also got me
the identity matrix.",00:14:16.750,00:14:20.010
"So this guy right here, this
series of matrix products,",00:14:20.010,00:14:23.640
"this must be the same thing as
my inverse matrix, as my",00:14:23.640,00:14:29.750
inverse transformation matrix.,00:14:29.750,00:14:32.170
"And so we could actually
calculate it if we wanted to.",00:14:32.170,00:14:35.720
"Just like we did, we actually
figured out what S1 was.",00:14:35.720,00:14:38.100
We did it down here.,00:14:38.100,00:14:39.560
"We could do a similar operation
to figure out what",00:14:39.560,00:14:41.520
"S2 was, S3 was, and then
multiply them all out.",00:14:41.520,00:14:46.370
"We would have actually
constructed A inverse.",00:14:46.370,00:14:50.810
"I guess, something more
interesting we could do",00:14:50.810,00:14:53.240
"instead of doing that, what if
we applied these same matrix",00:14:53.240,00:15:00.820
"products to the identity
matrix.",00:15:00.820,00:15:05.020
"So the whole time we did
here, when we did",00:15:05.020,00:15:06.370
our first row operation.,00:15:06.370,00:15:07.950
"So we have here, we
have the matrix A.",00:15:07.950,00:15:10.500
"Let's say we have an identity
matrix on the right.",00:15:10.500,00:15:13.120
"Let's call that I,
right there.",00:15:13.120,00:15:15.050
"Now, our first linear
transformation we did-- we saw",00:15:15.050,00:15:17.930
"that right here-- that
was equivalent to",00:15:17.930,00:15:20.240
multiplying S1 times A.,00:15:20.240,00:15:23.910
"The first set of row operations
was this.",00:15:23.910,00:15:26.330
It got us here.,00:15:26.330,00:15:27.510
"Now, if we perform that same set
of row operations on the",00:15:27.510,00:15:30.520
"identity matrix, what
are we going to get?",00:15:30.520,00:15:32.630
"We're going to get
the matrix S1.",00:15:32.630,00:15:35.050
"S1 times the identity
matrix is just S1.",00:15:35.050,00:15:37.580
"All of the columns of anything
times the identity times the",00:15:37.580,00:15:41.490
"standard basis columns, it'll
just be equal to itself.",00:15:41.490,00:15:43.760
"You'll just be left
with that S1.",00:15:43.760,00:15:45.930
This is S1 times I.,00:15:45.930,00:15:47.820
That's just S1.,00:15:47.820,00:15:49.290
Fair enough.,00:15:49.290,00:15:50.090
"Now, you performed your next row
operation and you ended up",00:15:50.090,00:15:52.310
"with S2 times S1, times A.",00:15:52.310,00:15:56.320
"Now if you performed that same
row operation on this guy",00:15:56.320,00:15:58.710
"right there, what
would you have?",00:15:58.710,00:16:00.820
"You would have S2 times S1,
times the identity matrix.",00:16:00.820,00:16:05.430
"Now, our last row operation we
represented with the matrix",00:16:05.430,00:16:08.300
product S3.,00:16:08.300,00:16:09.800
"We're multiplying it by the
transformation matrix S3.",00:16:09.800,00:16:12.690
"So if you did that, you
have S3, S2, S1 A.",00:16:12.690,00:16:16.990
"But if you perform the same
exact row operations on this",00:16:16.990,00:16:19.550
"guy right here, you have
S3, S2, S1, times",00:16:19.550,00:16:24.940
the identity matrix.,00:16:24.940,00:16:26.360
"Now when you did this, when
you performed these row",00:16:26.360,00:16:28.510
"operations here, this got you
to the identity matrix.",00:16:28.510,00:16:32.690
"Well, what are these going
to get you to?",00:16:32.690,00:16:35.310
"When you just performed the same
exact row operations you",00:16:35.310,00:16:37.800
"performed on A to get to the
identity matrix, if you",00:16:37.800,00:16:40.270
"performed those same exact row
operations on the identity",00:16:40.270,00:16:43.110
"matrix, what do you get?",00:16:43.110,00:16:44.630
You get this guy right here.,00:16:44.630,00:16:46.990
"Anything times that identity
matrix is going",00:16:46.990,00:16:48.790
to be equal to itself.,00:16:48.790,00:16:50.930
So what is that right there?,00:16:50.930,00:16:52.350
That is A inverse.,00:16:52.350,00:16:53.600
"So we have a generalized way
of figuring out the inverse",00:16:56.370,00:17:00.850
for transformation matrix.,00:17:00.850,00:17:02.630
"What I can do is, let's
say I have some",00:17:02.630,00:17:04.819
transformation matrix A.,00:17:04.819,00:17:07.160
"I can set up an augmented
matrix where I put the",00:17:07.160,00:17:09.420
"identity matrix right there,
just like that, and I perform",00:17:09.420,00:17:13.750
a bunch of row operations.,00:17:13.750,00:17:15.000
"And you could represent them
as matrix products.",00:17:17.670,00:17:20.060
"But you perform a bunch of row
operations on all of them.",00:17:20.060,00:17:23.069
"You perform the same operations
you perform on A as",00:17:23.069,00:17:25.180
"you would do on the
identity matrix.",00:17:25.180,00:17:27.119
"By the time you have A as an
identity matrix, you have A in",00:17:27.119,00:17:31.340
reduced row echelon form.,00:17:31.340,00:17:33.250
"By the time A is like that, your
identity matrix, having",00:17:33.250,00:17:38.950
"performed the same exact
operations on it, it is going",00:17:38.950,00:17:42.290
"to be transformed into
A's inverse.",00:17:42.290,00:17:46.300
"This is a very useful tool for
solving actual inverses.",00:17:46.300,00:17:50.340
"Now, I've explained
the theoretical",00:17:50.340,00:17:52.150
reason why this works.,00:17:52.150,00:17:53.180
"In the next video we'll
actually solve this.",00:17:53.180,00:17:54.740
"Maybe we'll do it for the
example that I started off",00:17:54.740,00:17:57.610
with in this video.,00:17:57.610,00:17:59.740
