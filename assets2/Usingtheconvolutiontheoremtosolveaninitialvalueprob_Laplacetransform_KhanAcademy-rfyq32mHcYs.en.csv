"Now that we know a little bit
about the convolution integral",00:00:00.580,00:00:03.170
"and how it applies to the
Laplace transform, let's",00:00:03.170,00:00:05.200
"actually try to solve an actual
differential equation",00:00:05.200,00:00:07.950
using what we know.,00:00:07.950,00:00:09.270
"So I have this equation here,
this initial value problem,",00:00:09.270,00:00:12.440
"where it says that the second
derivative of y plus 2 times",00:00:12.440,00:00:17.410
"the first derivative of y, plus
2 times y, is equal to",00:00:17.410,00:00:23.380
sine of alpha t.,00:00:23.380,00:00:26.970
"And they give us some
initial conditions.",00:00:26.970,00:00:29.340
"They tell us that y of 0 is
equal to 0, and that y prime",00:00:29.340,00:00:34.740
of 0 is equal to 0.,00:00:34.740,00:00:38.090
"And that's nice and convenient
that those initial conditions",00:00:38.090,00:00:40.350
"tend to make the problem
pretty clean.",00:00:40.350,00:00:42.280
But let's get to the problem.,00:00:42.280,00:00:44.170
"So the first thing we do is we
take the Laplace transform of",00:00:44.170,00:00:46.940
both sides of this equation.,00:00:46.940,00:00:48.960
"The Laplace transform of
the second derivative",00:00:48.960,00:00:51.470
of y is just s squared.,00:00:51.470,00:00:54.380
"This should be a bit of second
nature to you by now.",00:00:54.380,00:00:56.550
"It's s squared times the Laplace
transform of Y, which",00:00:56.550,00:01:01.530
"I'll just write as capital Y
of s, minus s-- so we start",00:01:01.530,00:01:06.580
"with the same degree as the
number of derivatives we're",00:01:06.580,00:01:08.500
"taking, and then we decrement
that every time-- minus s",00:01:08.500,00:01:12.040
"times y of 0-- you kind of think
of this as the integral,",00:01:12.040,00:01:16.130
"and you take the derivative 1,
so this isn't exactly the",00:01:16.130,00:01:18.770
"derivative of that-- minus, you
decrement that 1, you just",00:01:18.770,00:01:22.286
"have a 1 there, y prime of o.",00:01:22.286,00:01:25.680
"And that's the Laplace transform
of the second",00:01:25.680,00:01:28.210
derivative.,00:01:28.210,00:01:28.730
"Now, we have to do the Laplace
transform of 2 times the first",00:01:28.730,00:01:33.370
derivative.,00:01:33.370,00:01:33.860
"That's just going to be equal
to plus 2, times sY of s-- s",00:01:33.860,00:01:40.470
"times the Laplace transform
of Y; that's that",00:01:40.470,00:01:42.930
there-- minus y of 0.,00:01:42.930,00:01:48.920
And we just have one left.,00:01:48.920,00:01:51.010
The Laplace transform of 2Y.,00:01:51.010,00:01:54.110
"That's just equal to plus
2 times the Laplace",00:01:54.110,00:01:57.530
transform of Y.,00:01:57.530,00:01:59.320
"And then that's going to be
equal to the Laplace transform",00:01:59.320,00:02:02.060
of sine of alpha t.,00:02:02.060,00:02:05.910
"We've done that multiple
times so far.",00:02:05.910,00:02:08.300
"That's just alpha over s squared
plus alpha squared.",00:02:08.300,00:02:15.840
"Now, the next thing we want to
do is we want to separate out",00:02:15.840,00:02:17.820
"the Laplace transform of Y
terms, or the Y of s terms.",00:02:17.820,00:02:21.500
"Actually, even better, let's
get rid of these initial",00:02:21.500,00:02:23.790
conditions.,00:02:23.790,00:02:24.640
"y of 0, and y prime of 0 is
0, so this term is 0.",00:02:24.640,00:02:29.460
"That term is 0, and
that term is 0.",00:02:29.460,00:02:33.230
"So our whole expression-- I
can get rid of the colors",00:02:33.230,00:02:36.570
"now-- it just becomes-- let me
pick a nice color here--",00:02:36.570,00:02:40.380
"becomes s squared times Y of
s, plus 2s, Y of s-- that's",00:02:40.380,00:02:51.230
"that term right there-- plus
2Y of s, is equal to the",00:02:51.230,00:02:57.580
"right-hand side, is equal to
alpha over s squared plus",00:02:57.580,00:03:03.750
alpha squared.,00:03:03.750,00:03:04.960
"Now let's factor out the
Y of s, or the Laplace",00:03:04.960,00:03:07.390
transform of Y.,00:03:07.390,00:03:09.210
"And so we get s squared plus 2s,
plus 2, all of that times",00:03:09.210,00:03:17.790
"Y of s, is equal to this
right-hand side, is equal to",00:03:17.790,00:03:22.350
"alpha over s squared,
plus alpha squared.",00:03:22.350,00:03:26.480
"Now we can divide both sides of
this equation by this thing",00:03:26.480,00:03:29.350
"right here, by that
right there.",00:03:29.350,00:03:33.250
"And we get Y of s, the Laplace
transform of Y is equal to",00:03:33.250,00:03:38.870
"this thing, alpha over s
squared, plus alpha squared,",00:03:38.870,00:03:44.570
"times-- or, you know, I could
just say times-- 1 over s",00:03:44.570,00:03:49.770
"squared, plus 2s, plus 2.",00:03:49.770,00:03:52.380
"I could just say divided by
this, but it works out the",00:03:52.380,00:03:55.040
same either way.,00:03:55.040,00:03:56.700
"Now, what can we do here?",00:03:56.700,00:03:57.590
"Remember, I was doing this in
the context of convolution, so",00:03:57.590,00:04:01.290
"I want to look for a Laplace
transform that looks like the",00:04:01.290,00:04:04.110
"product of two Laplace
transforms. I know what the",00:04:04.110,00:04:06.820
"inverse Laplace transform
of this is.",00:04:06.820,00:04:08.330
"In fact, I just took it.",00:04:08.330,00:04:09.380
It's sine of alpha t.,00:04:09.380,00:04:10.890
"So if I can figure out the
inverse Laplace transform of",00:04:10.890,00:04:13.150
"this, I could at least express
our function y of t at least",00:04:13.150,00:04:16.950
"as a convolution integral, even
if I don't necessarily",00:04:16.950,00:04:19.170
solve the integral.,00:04:19.170,00:04:20.070
"From there, it's just calculus,
or if it's an",00:04:20.070,00:04:21.870
"unsolvable integral, we could
just use a computer or",00:04:21.870,00:04:24.180
"something, although you could
actually use a computer to",00:04:24.180,00:04:26.060
"solve this so, you might
skip some steps even",00:04:26.060,00:04:28.500
going through this.,00:04:28.500,00:04:29.080
"But anyway, let's just try
to get this in terms of a",00:04:29.080,00:04:31.360
convolution integral.,00:04:31.360,00:04:33.430
So what can I do with this?,00:04:33.430,00:04:34.930
"This is, let's see, this
isn't a perfect square.",00:04:34.930,00:04:37.970
"So if this isn't a perfect
square, the next best thing is",00:04:37.970,00:04:40.250
"to try to complete
the square here.",00:04:40.250,00:04:41.870
"So let's try to write this as
a, so let's see, if I write",00:04:41.870,00:04:45.990
"this as s squared plus 2s,
plus something, plus 2.",00:04:45.990,00:04:53.640
I just rewrote it like this.,00:04:53.640,00:04:55.110
"And if I wrote this as s squared
plus 2s, plus 1, that",00:04:55.110,00:04:58.250
becomes s plus 1 squared.,00:04:58.250,00:05:00.130
"But if I add a 1, I have
to also subtract a 1.",00:05:00.130,00:05:02.210
"I can't just add 1's arbitrarily
to things.",00:05:02.210,00:05:04.430
"So if I add 1 I have to subtract
a 1 to cancel out",00:05:04.430,00:05:06.990
with that 1.,00:05:06.990,00:05:07.430
"So I really haven't changed
this at all, I just",00:05:07.430,00:05:09.690
rewrote it like this.,00:05:09.690,00:05:11.720
"But this now, I can rewrite
this term right",00:05:11.720,00:05:14.890
here as s plus 1 squared.,00:05:14.890,00:05:18.900
And then this becomes plus 1.,00:05:18.900,00:05:22.460
That's this term right here.,00:05:22.460,00:05:23.810
This is the plus 1.,00:05:23.810,00:05:25.250
"So I could rewrite my whole Y
of s is now equal to alpha",00:05:25.250,00:05:31.390
"over s squared, plus alpha
squared, times 1 over this",00:05:31.390,00:05:39.690
"thing, s plus 1 squared,
plus 1.",00:05:39.690,00:05:45.630
"Now, I already said, I know
what the inverse Laplace",00:05:45.630,00:05:49.430
transform of this thing is.,00:05:49.430,00:05:50.920
"Now I just have to figure out
what the inverse Laplace",00:05:54.760,00:05:56.600
transform of this thing is.,00:05:56.600,00:05:58.260
"Of this-- let me pick a nice
color-- of this blue thing in",00:05:58.260,00:06:02.160
"the blue box, and then
I can express it as",00:06:02.160,00:06:04.240
a convolution integral.,00:06:04.240,00:06:05.350
And how do I do that?,00:06:05.350,00:06:06.200
I could just do it right now.,00:06:06.200,00:06:07.270
"I could just immediately say
that y of t-- let me write",00:06:07.270,00:06:11.250
"this down-- y of t, so the
inverse is equal to the",00:06:11.250,00:06:17.830
"inverse Laplace transform
of, obviously of Y of s.",00:06:17.830,00:06:22.740
"Let me write that
down, Y of s.",00:06:22.740,00:06:26.430
"Which is equal to the inverse
Laplace transform",00:06:26.430,00:06:29.630
of these two things.,00:06:29.630,00:06:31.420
"The inverse Laplace transform of
alpha over s squared, plus",00:06:31.420,00:06:36.370
"alpha squared, times 1 over
s plus 1 squared, plus 1.",00:06:36.370,00:06:46.060
"And now the convolution theorem
tells us that this is",00:06:46.060,00:06:50.300
"going to be equal to the inverse
Laplace transform of",00:06:50.300,00:06:55.440
"this first term in
the product.",00:06:55.440,00:06:58.182
"So the inverse Laplace transform
of that first term,",00:06:58.182,00:07:02.740
"alpha over s squared, plus
alpha squared, convoluted",00:07:02.740,00:07:08.960
"with-- I'll do a little
convolution sign there.",00:07:08.960,00:07:14.710
I was about to say convulsion.,00:07:14.710,00:07:16.510
They're not too different.,00:07:16.510,00:07:18.610
"Convoluted with the inverse
Laplace transform of this",00:07:18.610,00:07:20.930
"term, the inverse Laplace
transform of 1 over s plus 1",00:07:20.930,00:07:27.990
"squared, plus 1.",00:07:27.990,00:07:30.950
"If I have the product of two
Laplace transforms, and I can",00:07:30.950,00:07:34.730
"take each of them independently
and I can invert",00:07:34.730,00:07:37.100
"them, the inverse Laplace
transform of their product is",00:07:37.100,00:07:41.410
"going to be the convolution of
the inverse Laplace transforms",00:07:41.410,00:07:44.230
"of each of them, each
of the terms.",00:07:44.230,00:07:48.460
"And what I just said confused
me a bit, so I don't want to",00:07:48.460,00:07:50.920
confuse you.,00:07:50.920,00:07:51.470
But I think you get the idea.,00:07:51.470,00:07:52.550
I have these two things.,00:07:52.550,00:07:53.620
"I recognize these
independently.",00:07:53.620,00:07:55.590
"I can independently take the
inverse of each of these",00:07:55.590,00:07:58.210
"things, so the inverse Laplace
transform of their products is",00:07:58.210,00:08:02.840
"going to be the convolution
of each of their inverse",00:08:02.840,00:08:07.930
"transforms. Now what's
this over here?",00:08:07.930,00:08:10.610
"Well I had this in the beginning
of the problem?",00:08:10.610,00:08:12.340
"The inverse Laplace transform
of this, right here, is sine",00:08:12.340,00:08:16.210
of alpha t.,00:08:16.210,00:08:17.460
"And then we're going to
convolute that with the",00:08:21.070,00:08:24.140
"inverse Laplace transform
of this right here.",00:08:24.140,00:08:27.070
"Let's do a little bit of work on
the side, just to make sure",00:08:27.070,00:08:29.980
we get this right.,00:08:29.980,00:08:31.380
"So the Laplace transform of sine
of t is equal to 1 over s",00:08:31.380,00:08:41.490
"squared, plus 1.",00:08:41.490,00:08:42.960
"That looks like this, but I
was shifted by minus 1.",00:08:42.960,00:08:47.480
"You might remember that the
Laplace transform of e to the",00:08:47.480,00:08:52.780
"at sine of t, when you multiply
e to the at times",00:08:52.780,00:08:58.090
"anything, you're shifting
its Laplace transform.",00:08:58.090,00:09:00.350
"So that will be equal
to 1 over s minus a",00:09:00.350,00:09:04.820
"squared, plus 1.",00:09:04.820,00:09:08.900
"We essentially shifted
it by a.",00:09:08.900,00:09:10.390
"So now we have something that
looks very similar to this.",00:09:10.390,00:09:12.830
"If we just set our a to be equal
to negative 1, here our",00:09:12.830,00:09:17.110
"a is equal to negative 1, then
it fits this pattern.",00:09:17.110,00:09:20.400
This is s minus negative 1.,00:09:20.400,00:09:25.230
"So the inverse Laplace transform
of this thing right",00:09:25.230,00:09:27.640
"here is just e to the a, which
is minus 1, so minus 1t,",00:09:27.640,00:09:34.530
times sine of t.,00:09:34.530,00:09:39.800
"So this is the solution to our
differential equation, even",00:09:39.800,00:09:42.980
"though it's not in a pleasant
form to look at.",00:09:42.980,00:09:46.780
"And we can, if we want, express
it as an integral.",00:09:46.780,00:09:48.890
"I'm not going to actually solve
the integral in this",00:09:48.890,00:09:50.410
"problem, because it gets hairy,
and it's not even clear",00:09:50.410,00:09:52.570
"that-- well, I won't even
attempt to do it.",00:09:52.570,00:09:54.190
"But I just want to get into a
form, and from there it's just",00:09:54.190,00:09:56.100
integral calculus.,00:09:56.100,00:09:58.020
or maybe a computer.,00:09:58.020,00:10:01.500
"What's the convolution
of these two things?",00:10:01.500,00:10:03.110
"It's the integral from 0 to t,
of sine of the first function",00:10:03.110,00:10:10.400
of t minus tau.,00:10:10.400,00:10:11.810
"Well, I could actually switch,
and I haven't shown you this,",00:10:14.600,00:10:16.800
"but we can switch the order
either way, but actually let",00:10:16.800,00:10:20.170
me just do it this way.,00:10:20.170,00:10:21.420
"I could write this as
sine of [? out ?]",00:10:24.720,00:10:27.390
"t minus tau, times alpha-- I'm
taking the sine of all of",00:10:27.390,00:10:32.950
"those things-- times e to the
minus tau, sine of tau, dtau.",00:10:32.950,00:10:42.870
"That's one way, that if I wanted
to express the solution",00:10:42.870,00:10:45.330
"of this differential equation's
integral, I could",00:10:45.330,00:10:47.310
write it like that.,00:10:47.310,00:10:48.310
"And it actually should be kind
of obvious to you that this",00:10:48.310,00:10:50.660
could go either way.,00:10:50.660,00:10:51.890
"Because when it was a product up
here, obviously order does",00:10:51.890,00:10:57.190
not matter.,00:10:57.190,00:10:57.730
"I could write this term first,
or I could write that term",00:10:57.730,00:11:00.470
"first. So regardless of which
term is written first, the",00:11:00.470,00:11:05.450
same principle would apply.,00:11:05.450,00:11:07.690
"And I'll formally prove
it in a future video.",00:11:07.690,00:11:09.910
"So we could have also done
it the other way.",00:11:09.910,00:11:12.290
"We could have written this
expression as e to the minus",00:11:12.290,00:11:16.260
"t, sine of t, convoluted
with sine of alpha t.",00:11:16.260,00:11:22.700
"And that would be equal to the
integral from 0 to t, of e to",00:11:22.700,00:11:27.510
"the minus t minus tau, sine of
t, minus tau, times sine of",00:11:27.510,00:11:38.560
"alpha tau, dtau.",00:11:38.560,00:11:40.800
So these are equivalent.,00:11:40.800,00:11:42.770
"Either of these would be
an acceptable answer.",00:11:42.770,00:11:46.440
"And normally on a test like
this, the teacher won't expect",00:11:46.440,00:11:48.480
"you to actually evaluate
these integrals.",00:11:48.480,00:11:50.240
"The teacher will just say, get
it into an integral just to",00:11:50.240,00:11:53.370
"kind of see whether you know
how to convolute things and",00:11:53.370,00:11:56.150
"get your solution to the
differential equation at least",00:11:56.150,00:11:59.260
"into this form, because from
here it really is just, I",00:11:59.260,00:12:02.310
"won't say basic calculus,
but it's",00:12:02.310,00:12:03.860
non-differential equations.,00:12:03.860,00:12:05.135
"So hopefully, this second
example with the convolution",00:12:05.135,00:12:08.560
"to solve an inverse transform
clarified",00:12:08.560,00:12:10.790
things up a little bit.,00:12:10.790,00:12:12.940
