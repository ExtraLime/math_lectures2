"We've seen in several videos
that the column space of a",00:00:00.450,00:00:06.640
"matrix is pretty straightforward
to find.",00:00:06.640,00:00:08.410
"In this situation the column
space of A is just equal to",00:00:08.410,00:00:12.380
"all of the linear combinations
of the column vectors of A.",00:00:12.380,00:00:16.170
"Another way of saying all of
the linear combinations is",00:00:16.170,00:00:18.690
"just the span of each of
these column vectors.",00:00:18.690,00:00:22.430
"So if we call this one
right here a1.",00:00:22.430,00:00:25.930
"This is a2, a3, a4.",00:00:25.930,00:00:29.050
This is a5.,00:00:29.050,00:00:31.620
"Then the column space of A is
just equal to the span of a1,",00:00:31.620,00:00:37.200
"a2, a3, a4, and a5.",00:00:37.200,00:00:43.430
Fair enough.,00:00:43.430,00:00:44.560
"But a more interesting question
is whether these guys",00:00:44.560,00:00:47.260
"form a basis for the
column space.",00:00:47.260,00:00:50.300
"Or even more interesting, what
is the basis for the column",00:00:50.300,00:00:53.680
space of A?,00:00:53.680,00:00:54.450
"And in this video I'm going
to show you a method for",00:00:54.450,00:00:56.080
"determining the basis, and along
the way we'll get an",00:00:56.080,00:00:58.620
"intuition for maybe
why it works.",00:00:58.620,00:01:00.130
"And if I have time, actually I
probably won't have time in",00:01:00.130,00:01:02.540
this video.,00:01:02.540,00:01:02.580
"In the next video I'll prove
to you why it works.",00:01:02.580,00:01:04.980
"So we want to figure out
the basis for the",00:01:08.780,00:01:14.280
column space of A.,00:01:14.280,00:01:15.960
"Remember the basis just means
that vectors span, C, A.",00:01:15.960,00:01:24.150
"Clearly these vectors span
our column space.",00:01:24.150,00:01:26.730
"I mean the span of these vectors
is the column space.",00:01:26.730,00:01:29.150
"But in order to be a basis, the
vectors also have to be",00:01:29.150,00:01:31.420
"linearly, let me just write,
linearly independent.",00:01:31.420,00:01:35.590
"And we don't know whether these
guys or what subset of",00:01:35.590,00:01:39.120
"these guys are linearly
independent.",00:01:39.120,00:01:42.990
"So what you do-- and I'm just
really going to describe the",00:01:42.990,00:01:45.050
"process here, as opposed to the
proof-- is you put this",00:01:45.050,00:01:47.930
"guy in reduced row
echelon form.",00:01:47.930,00:01:49.790
So let's do that.,00:01:49.790,00:01:51.310
"So let me see if
we can do that.",00:01:51.310,00:01:54.600
"Let's keep our first
row the same.",00:01:54.600,00:01:58.610
"1, 0.",00:01:58.610,00:02:00.670
"Let me do it actually in the
right side right here.",00:02:00.670,00:02:02.840
"So let's keep the first
row the same.",00:02:02.840,00:02:04.250
"1, 0, minus 1, 0, 4.",00:02:04.250,00:02:07.490
"And then let's replace our
second row with the second row",00:02:07.490,00:02:12.240
minus 2 times the first row.,00:02:12.240,00:02:16.260
So then our second row.,00:02:16.260,00:02:17.825
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.,00:02:17.825,00:02:21.100
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.,00:02:21.100,00:02:24.530
"0 minus 2 times negative
1, so that's 0 plus 2.",00:02:24.530,00:02:31.350
0 minus 2 times 0 is just 0.,00:02:31.350,00:02:34.800
"And then 9 minus
2 times 4 is 1.",00:02:34.800,00:02:38.570
Fair enough.,00:02:38.570,00:02:39.620
"Now we want to zero
out this guy.",00:02:39.620,00:02:41.770
"Well it seems like a pretty
straightforward way.",00:02:41.770,00:02:43.400
"Just replace this row with this
row plus the first row.",00:02:43.400,00:02:46.590
So minus 1 plus 1 is 0.,00:02:46.590,00:02:50.920
2 plus 0 is 2.,00:02:50.920,00:02:53.420
5 minus 1 is 4.,00:02:53.420,00:02:57.000
1 plus 0 is 1.,00:02:57.000,00:03:00.730
Minus 5 plus 4 is minus 1.,00:03:00.730,00:03:05.290
"And then finally we got this guy
right here, and in order",00:03:05.290,00:03:09.330
"to zero him out, let's
replace him with him",00:03:09.330,00:03:11.910
minus the first row.,00:03:11.910,00:03:14.210
So 1 minus 1 is 0.,00:03:14.210,00:03:18.120
Minus 1 minus 0 is minus 1.,00:03:18.120,00:03:21.750
"Minus 3 minus negative 1, that's
minus 3 plus 1, so",00:03:21.750,00:03:25.690
that's minus 2.,00:03:25.690,00:03:27.540
Minus 2 minus 0 is minus 2.,00:03:27.540,00:03:31.900
And then 9 minus 4 is 5.,00:03:31.900,00:03:35.360
So we did one round.,00:03:35.360,00:03:37.360
"We got our first pivot
column going.",00:03:37.360,00:03:41.600
"Now let's do another round
of row operations.",00:03:41.600,00:03:45.420
"Well we want to zero all
of these guys out.",00:03:45.420,00:03:47.090
Luckily this is already 0.,00:03:47.090,00:03:48.930
"So we don't have to change our
first row or our second row.",00:03:48.930,00:03:51.100
"So we get 1, 0, minus 1, 0, 4.",00:03:51.100,00:03:55.490
"Our second row becomes
0, 1, 2, 0, 1.",00:03:55.490,00:04:01.980
"And now let us see if we can
eliminate this guy right here.",00:04:01.980,00:04:05.880
"And let's do it by replacing our
blue row, our third row,",00:04:05.880,00:04:09.580
"with the third row minus
2 times the second row.",00:04:09.580,00:04:12.760
So 0 minus 2 times 0 is 0.,00:04:12.760,00:04:15.600
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.,00:04:15.600,00:04:18.170
4 minus 2 times 2 is 0.,00:04:18.170,00:04:21.630
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.,00:04:21.630,00:04:26.350
"Minus 1 minus 2 times
1 is minus 3.",00:04:26.350,00:04:31.660
All right.,00:04:31.660,00:04:32.870
"Now this last guy we want to
eliminate him, and we want",00:04:32.870,00:04:35.690
turn this into a 0.,00:04:35.690,00:04:37.590
"Let's replace this fourth row
with the fourth row plus the",00:04:37.590,00:04:40.620
second row.,00:04:40.620,00:04:41.300
So 0 plus 0 is 0.,00:04:41.300,00:04:43.690
Minus 1 plus minus 1 is 0.,00:04:43.690,00:04:47.320
Minus 2 plus minus 2 is 0.,00:04:47.320,00:04:49.920
Minus 2 plus 0 is minus 2.,00:04:49.920,00:04:54.190
And then 5 plus 1 is 6.,00:04:54.190,00:04:57.070
We're getting close.,00:05:00.850,00:05:02.950
"So let's look at our
pivot entries.",00:05:02.950,00:05:07.050
We have this is a pivot entry.,00:05:07.050,00:05:08.490
That's a pivot entry.,00:05:08.490,00:05:09.900
"And this is not a pivot entry,
because it's following",00:05:09.900,00:05:14.420
obviously another.,00:05:14.420,00:05:15.500
"This guy is a pivot entry
right here, or will be.",00:05:15.500,00:05:19.370
"Zero this minus 2 out, and
I think we'll be done.",00:05:19.370,00:05:23.950
"So let me write my first row
just the way it is, because",00:05:23.950,00:05:26.830
"everything above it is
0, so we don't have",00:05:26.830,00:05:28.090
to worry about it.,00:05:28.090,00:05:28.790
"So my first row I can just write
as 1, 0, minus 1, 0, 4.",00:05:28.790,00:05:38.110
"I can write my second
row, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1.",00:05:38.110,00:05:44.170
"I can write my third row
as 0, 0, 0, 1 minus 3.",00:05:44.170,00:05:49.260
"And now let's replace
my fourth row.",00:05:49.260,00:05:51.830
"Let's replace it with it plus
2 times the second row.",00:05:51.830,00:05:55.830
"So 0 plus 2 times 0, 0 plus 2
times 0, 0 plus 2 times 0,",00:05:55.830,00:06:00.690
"minus 2 plus 2 times
1 is just 0.",00:06:00.690,00:06:04.270
"6 plus 2 times minus 3, that's
6 minus 6, that's just 0.",00:06:04.270,00:06:08.440
"And there we've actually put
our matrix in reduced row",00:06:08.440,00:06:13.570
echelon form.,00:06:13.570,00:06:14.560
"So let me put brackets
around it.",00:06:14.560,00:06:17.710
"It's not so bad if you just
kind of go and just do the",00:06:17.710,00:06:21.570
manipulations.,00:06:21.570,00:06:22.350
"And sometimes you kind of get
a headache thinking about",00:06:22.350,00:06:25.410
"doing something like this,
but this wasn't too bad.",00:06:25.410,00:06:27.110
"So this is let me just say the
reduced row echelon form of A.",00:06:27.110,00:06:31.980
"Let me just call
that matrix R.",00:06:31.980,00:06:34.010
"So this is matrix
R right there.",00:06:34.010,00:06:37.520
"Now what do we see
about matrix R?",00:06:37.520,00:06:39.410
"Well it has 3 pivot entries,
or 3 pivot columns.",00:06:39.410,00:06:42.480
"Let me square them out,
or circle them out.",00:06:42.480,00:06:45.460
"Column 1 is a pivot column,
column 2 is a pivot column,",00:06:45.460,00:06:49.700
"and column 3 is a
pivot column.",00:06:49.700,00:06:54.890
"And we've done this in
previous videos.",00:06:54.890,00:06:58.340
"There's two things
that you can see.",00:06:58.340,00:07:00.040
"These three columns are clearly
linearly independent.",00:07:00.040,00:07:03.140
How do we know that?,00:07:03.140,00:07:04.390
"And that's just with respect
to each other.",00:07:06.750,00:07:08.220
"If we just took a set of, let's
call this r1, r2, and",00:07:08.220,00:07:14.060
"this would be r3, this would
be r4 right here.",00:07:14.060,00:07:17.830
"It's clear that the set r1,
r2, and r4 is linearly",00:07:17.830,00:07:27.950
independent.,00:07:27.950,00:07:28.335
And you say why is that?,00:07:28.335,00:07:30.000
"Well look, our one's got a 1
here, while the other two have",00:07:30.000,00:07:33.110
"a 0 in that entry, right?",00:07:33.110,00:07:35.550
"And this is by definition
of pivot entries.",00:07:35.550,00:07:37.430
"Pivot entries have 0's, or
pivot columns have 0's",00:07:37.430,00:07:40.890
"everywhere except for
where they have a 1.",00:07:40.890,00:07:44.310
"For any pivot column, it will be
the only pivot column that",00:07:44.310,00:07:47.830
has 0's there.,00:07:47.830,00:07:49.210
"Or it'll be the only pivot
column that has a 1 there.",00:07:49.210,00:07:52.170
"So there's no way that you can
add up combinations of these",00:07:52.170,00:07:55.410
guys to get a 1.,00:07:55.410,00:07:56.230
"You can say 100 times
0, minus 3, times 0.",00:07:56.230,00:07:58.950
"You're just going to
get a bunch of 0's.",00:07:58.950,00:08:00.140
"So no combination of these
two guys is going to be",00:08:00.140,00:08:01.910
equal to that guy.,00:08:01.910,00:08:03.270
"By the same reasoning, no
combination of that and that",00:08:03.270,00:08:07.660
is going to equal this.,00:08:07.660,00:08:08.680
"This is by definition
of a pivot entry.",00:08:08.680,00:08:11.140
"When you put it in reduced row
echelon form, it's very clear",00:08:11.140,00:08:13.770
"that any pivot column will
be the only one to",00:08:13.770,00:08:16.870
have 1 in that place.,00:08:16.870,00:08:18.950
"So it's very clear that these
guys are linearly independent.",00:08:18.950,00:08:21.970
"Now it turns out, and I haven't
proven it to you, that",00:08:21.970,00:08:24.300
"the corresponding columns in
A-- this is r1, but it's A",00:08:24.300,00:08:28.820
"before we put it in reduced row
echelon form-- that these",00:08:28.820,00:08:31.840
"guys right here, so a1, a2,
and a4 are also linearly",00:08:31.840,00:08:41.380
independent.,00:08:41.380,00:08:42.760
"So a1-- let me circle
it-- a2, and a4.",00:08:42.760,00:08:47.440
"So if I write it like this,
a1, a2, and a4.",00:08:47.440,00:08:52.570
"Let me write it in
set notation.",00:08:52.570,00:08:55.310
"These guys are also linearly
independant,",00:08:55.310,00:08:59.170
which I haven't proven.,00:08:59.170,00:09:00.020
"But I think you can kind of
get a sense that these row",00:09:00.020,00:09:01.970
"operations really don't change
the sense of the matrix.",00:09:01.970,00:09:04.960
"And I'll do a better explanation
of this, but I",00:09:04.960,00:09:08.380
"really just wanted you to
understand how to develop a",00:09:08.380,00:09:10.770
basis for the column space.,00:09:10.770,00:09:12.500
"So they're linearly
independent.",00:09:12.500,00:09:13.700
"So the next question is do they
span our column space?",00:09:13.700,00:09:17.310
"And in order for them to span,
obviously all of these 5",00:09:17.310,00:09:19.970
"vectors, if you have all of
them, that's going to span",00:09:19.970,00:09:22.470
"your column space
by definition.",00:09:22.470,00:09:24.290
"But if we can show, and I'm not
going to show it in this",00:09:24.290,00:09:26.590
"video, but it turns out that you
can always represent the",00:09:26.590,00:09:31.850
"non-pivot columns as
linear combinations",00:09:31.850,00:09:38.660
of the pivot columns.,00:09:38.660,00:09:40.870
"And we've kind of touched on
that in previous videos where",00:09:40.870,00:09:43.260
"we find a solution for the
null space and all that.",00:09:43.260,00:09:46.220
"So these guys can definitely
be represented as linear",00:09:46.220,00:09:49.740
combinations of these guys.,00:09:49.740,00:09:50.880
"I haven't shown you that, but
if you take that on faith,",00:09:50.880,00:09:55.230
"then you don't need
that column and",00:09:55.230,00:09:57.415
that column to span.,00:09:57.415,00:09:58.460
"If you did then, or I guess a
better way to think it, you",00:09:58.460,00:10:03.970
"don't need them to span,
although they",00:10:03.970,00:10:05.535
are part of the span.,00:10:05.535,00:10:06.520
"Because if you needed this guy,
you can just construct",00:10:06.520,00:10:08.925
"him with linear combinations
of these guys.",00:10:08.925,00:10:11.520
"So if you wanted to figure out
a basis for the column space",00:10:11.520,00:10:14.100
"of A, you literally
just take A into",00:10:14.100,00:10:16.160
reduced row echelon form.,00:10:16.160,00:10:17.900
"You look at the pivot entries
in the reduced row echelon",00:10:17.900,00:10:20.600
"form of A, and that's
those three.",00:10:20.600,00:10:23.450
"And then you look at the
corresponding columns to those",00:10:23.450,00:10:26.540
"pivot columns in your
original A.",00:10:26.540,00:10:28.660
And those form the basis.,00:10:28.660,00:10:31.020
"Because any linear combination
of them, or linear",00:10:31.020,00:10:33.690
"combinations of them can be
used to construct the",00:10:33.690,00:10:36.470
"non-pivot columns, and they're
linearly independant.",00:10:36.470,00:10:40.410
So I haven't shown you that.,00:10:40.410,00:10:41.490
"But for this case, if you want
to know the basis, it's just",00:10:41.490,00:10:47.350
"a1, a2, and a4.",00:10:47.350,00:10:49.500
"And now we can answer
another question.",00:10:52.310,00:10:53.860
"So a1, a2, and a4 form a basis
for the column space of A,",00:10:56.610,00:11:10.510
"because you can construct the
other two guys with linear",00:11:10.510,00:11:13.910
"combinations of our basis
vectors, and they're also",00:11:13.910,00:11:17.500
linearly independent.,00:11:17.500,00:11:19.060
"Now the next question is what is
the dimension of the basis?",00:11:19.060,00:11:22.970
"Or what is the dimension-- not
the dimension of the basis--",00:11:22.970,00:11:24.950
"what is the dimension of
the column space of A?",00:11:24.950,00:11:29.240
"Well the dimension is just the
number of vectors in any basis",00:11:29.240,00:11:32.490
for the column space.,00:11:32.490,00:11:33.750
"And all bases have the same
number of vectors for any",00:11:33.750,00:11:36.110
given subspace.,00:11:36.110,00:11:38.120
"So we have 1, 2, 3 vectors.",00:11:38.120,00:11:40.270
"So the dimension of our column
space is equal to 3.",00:11:40.270,00:11:44.990
"And the dimension of a column
space actually has a specific",00:11:44.990,00:11:48.000
"term for it, and that's
called the rank.",00:11:48.000,00:11:50.220
"So the rank of A, which is the
exact same thing as the",00:11:50.220,00:11:54.690
"dimension of the column space,
it is equal to 3.",00:11:54.690,00:11:58.990
"And another way to think about
it is, the rank of A is the",00:11:58.990,00:12:02.460
"number of linearly independent
column vectors that you have",00:12:02.460,00:12:06.840
"that can span your entire
column space.",00:12:06.840,00:12:09.470
"Or the number of linearly
independent column vectors",00:12:09.470,00:12:12.140
"that can be used to construct
all of the",00:12:12.140,00:12:14.300
other column vectors.,00:12:14.300,00:12:15.930
"But hopefully this didn't
confuse you too much, because",00:12:15.930,00:12:17.730
the idea is very simple.,00:12:17.730,00:12:19.140
"Take A, put it into reduced row
echelon form, see which",00:12:19.140,00:12:25.940
columns are pivot columns.,00:12:25.940,00:12:27.090
"The corresponding columns are
going to be a basis for your",00:12:27.090,00:12:30.950
column space.,00:12:30.950,00:12:32.000
"If you want to know the rank for
your matrix, you can just",00:12:32.000,00:12:35.340
count them.,00:12:35.340,00:12:36.360
"Or if you don't want to count
those, you could literally",00:12:36.360,00:12:37.860
"just count the number of pivot
columns you have in your",00:12:37.860,00:12:41.210
reduced row echelon form.,00:12:41.210,00:12:42.990
So that's how you do it.,00:12:42.990,00:12:44.570
"In the next video I'll explain
why this worked.",00:12:44.570,00:12:46.480
