"In this lesson and in this series of lessons, we will",00:00:00.510,00:00:04.360
"introduce you to the concept of data
structures.",00:00:04.360,00:00:07.870
Data structure is the most fundamental,00:00:07.870,00:00:10.249
"and building block concept in computer
science",00:00:10.249,00:00:13.429
"and good knowledge of data structures is
a must",00:00:13.429,00:00:16.510
to design and develop,00:00:16.510,00:00:18.980
efficient software systems.,00:00:18.980,00:00:21.140
"Ok, so let's get started",00:00:21.140,00:00:23.449
we deal with data all the time,00:00:23.449,00:00:25.589
"and how we store,",00:00:25.589,00:00:27.340
organize and group our data together,00:00:27.340,00:00:30.460
matters.,00:00:30.460,00:00:32.160
Let's pick up some examples from our day to day life,00:00:32.160,00:00:35.310
where organizing data in a particular structure helps us.,00:00:35.310,00:00:38.960
We are able to search a word quickly and efficiently  in a language,00:00:38.960,00:00:43.030
dictionary,00:00:43.030,00:00:44.310
because the,00:00:44.310,00:00:45.690
words in the dictionary are sorted.,00:00:45.690,00:00:48.720
"What if the words in the dictionary
were not sorted?",00:00:48.720,00:00:51.100
It would be impractical and impossible,00:00:51.100,00:00:53.890
"to search for a word among millions of
words.",00:00:53.890,00:00:56.520
"So, dictionary is organized",00:00:56.520,00:00:58.730
as a sorted list of words.,00:00:58.730,00:01:01.260
Let's pick up another example.,00:01:01.260,00:01:04.089
"If we have something like a city map,",00:01:04.089,00:01:06.500
"the data, like position of the landmark
and",00:01:06.500,00:01:09.550
"road network connections, all this data is",00:01:09.550,00:01:12.140
organized in the form of geometries. We,00:01:12.140,00:01:15.190
"show the map data in the form of
these geometries on a two-dimensional plane.",00:01:15.190,00:01:20.580
"So, map data needs to be structured",00:01:20.580,00:01:22.980
"like this so that we have scales and
directions and we are effectively able",00:01:22.980,00:01:26.390
to search for a landmark and,00:01:26.390,00:01:28.159
"and get route from one place to
another",00:01:28.159,00:01:30.700
and i will pick one more example,00:01:30.700,00:01:32.640
for something like,00:01:32.640,00:01:33.559
"uh... daily cash in and cash out
statement",00:01:33.559,00:01:37.130
of a business what we also call,00:01:37.130,00:01:39.240
"a cash book in accounts, it makes
most sense to organize and store the",00:01:39.240,00:01:43.400
data in the form of a tabular schema,00:01:43.400,00:01:45.820
"it is very easy to aggregate data and extract information, if the data is",00:01:45.820,00:01:50.229
"organized in these columns,",00:01:50.229,00:01:52.100
in these tables,00:01:52.100,00:01:53.310
"so different kind of structures are
needed",00:01:53.310,00:01:55.650
to organize different kind of data,00:01:55.650,00:01:57.550
now computers work with all kind of data,00:01:57.550,00:02:00.280
computers work with,00:02:00.280,00:02:02.590
"texts, images, videos",00:02:02.590,00:02:04.360
"relational data geospatial data and
pretty much any kind of data that we",00:02:04.360,00:02:09.490
have on this planet,00:02:09.490,00:02:10.719
how we store organize and group,00:02:10.719,00:02:13.859
"data in computers matters
because",00:02:13.859,00:02:17.169
"computers deal with really really large data
even with the computational power of",00:02:17.169,00:02:20.749
machines if,00:02:20.749,00:02:22.079
we do not use the right kind of structures,00:02:22.079,00:02:24.309
the right kind of logical structures,00:02:24.309,00:02:26.369
"then our software systems will not be
efficient",00:02:26.369,00:02:31.299
Formal definition of data structure would be that -,00:02:31.299,00:02:35.279
a data structures is a way,00:02:35.279,00:02:37.609
to store and organize data,00:02:37.609,00:02:40.889
in a computer so that,00:02:40.889,00:02:43.339
the data can be used efficiently,00:02:43.339,00:02:46.849
"when we study data structures as ways
to store and organize data",00:02:46.849,00:02:51.779
we study them in two ways,00:02:51.779,00:02:53.519
"so i'll say that we talk about data
structures as",00:02:53.519,00:02:57.139
"one we talk about them as mathematical
and logical models. when we talk about",00:02:57.139,00:03:02.139
"them as mathematical and logical models we
just look at an abstract view of them",00:03:02.139,00:03:07.409
"we just look at from a high level
what all features and what all",00:03:07.409,00:03:10.430
"operations define that particular data
structure",00:03:10.430,00:03:13.799
"example of uh... abstract view from
real-world can be something like",00:03:13.799,00:03:18.270
"the abstract view of a device named
television can be that",00:03:18.270,00:03:21.809
"it is an electrical device that can be
turned on and off",00:03:21.809,00:03:25.519
it can receive signals,00:03:25.519,00:03:27.649
for satellite programs and,00:03:27.649,00:03:29.749
the audio video,00:03:29.749,00:03:31.449
of the program and as long as i have,00:03:31.449,00:03:34.119
"a device like this i do not bother
how circuits are embedded to create this",00:03:34.119,00:03:38.499
"device or which company makes this
device",00:03:38.499,00:03:41.509
so this is an abstract view,00:03:41.509,00:03:44.109
"so when we study data structures
as mathematical or logical models",00:03:44.109,00:03:48.709
"we just define their abstract view or
in other words",00:03:48.709,00:03:51.979
we have a term for this we define them as,00:03:51.979,00:03:54.500
abstract data types,00:03:54.500,00:03:57.449
an example of,00:03:57.449,00:03:58.720
abstract data type,00:03:58.720,00:03:59.859
can be,00:03:59.859,00:04:00.869
"i want to define something called a
list",00:04:00.869,00:04:04.209
that should be able to,00:04:04.209,00:04:05.959
"store a group of elements of a
particular datatype and we should be",00:04:05.959,00:04:09.799
able to read,00:04:09.799,00:04:10.819
the elements,00:04:10.819,00:04:12.169
by their position in the list,00:04:12.169,00:04:14.319
and we should be also able to,00:04:14.319,00:04:16.030
"modify element at a particular
position in the list",00:04:16.030,00:04:19.409
"i would say store a given number of
elements of any datatype",00:04:19.409,00:04:22.709
"so we are just defining a model now can
implement this",00:04:22.709,00:04:26.190
"uh... in a programming language in a
number of ways",00:04:26.190,00:04:29.120
so this is uh... definition of,00:04:29.120,00:04:31.699
an abstract data type we will also call,00:04:31.699,00:04:33.939
abstract data type as adt,00:04:33.939,00:04:37.479
if you see,00:04:37.479,00:04:38.979
"all the high level languages
already have a concrete implementation",00:04:38.979,00:04:41.999
of such an adt,00:04:41.999,00:04:43.660
in the form of arrays,00:04:43.660,00:04:45.229
so arrays give us,00:04:45.229,00:04:46.560
all these functionalities so arrays are data types which are concrete,00:04:46.560,00:04:49.610
implementation,00:04:49.610,00:04:51.249
"so the second way of talking about data
structures is",00:04:51.249,00:04:54.430
talking about that implementation,00:04:54.430,00:04:57.310
"so implementations would be some
concrete types and not an abstract data",00:04:57.310,00:05:01.389
type,00:05:01.389,00:05:02.219
we can implement the same adt,00:05:02.219,00:05:04.449
in multiple ways in the same language,00:05:04.449,00:05:06.560
"for example in c or c++ we can
implement this list adt",00:05:06.560,00:05:11.159
as a data structure named,00:05:11.159,00:05:12.600
linked list,00:05:12.600,00:05:14.419
"and if you have not heard about it we
will be talking about them a lot",00:05:14.419,00:05:17.830
"we will be talking about linked list a lot
in the coming lessons",00:05:17.830,00:05:21.419
"okay, so lets define an abstract data type formally because this is one term",00:05:21.419,00:05:25.689
that,00:05:25.689,00:05:26.419
we will encounter quite often,00:05:26.419,00:05:28.880
"abstract data types are entities that
are definitions of data and operation",00:05:28.880,00:05:33.939
but do not have,00:05:33.939,00:05:35.449
"implementations so they do not have any
implementation details",00:05:35.449,00:05:39.429
"we will be talking about a lot of data
structures in this course",00:05:39.429,00:05:42.789
we will be talking about,00:05:42.789,00:05:44.250
"them as abstract data types and we will
also be looking at how to implement them",00:05:44.250,00:05:48.479
some of the data structures that we will talk about,00:05:48.479,00:05:52.149
are arrays linked list,00:05:52.149,00:05:54.470
"stack,",00:05:54.470,00:05:56.139
"queue,",00:05:56.139,00:05:57.490
"tree, graph and the list goes on",00:05:57.490,00:06:00.069
there are many more to study,00:06:00.069,00:06:03.009
"so when we will study these data structures
we will study their logical view",00:06:03.009,00:06:08.159
"we will study what operations are available
to us with these data structures",00:06:08.159,00:06:13.039
we will study the cost of these operations,00:06:13.039,00:06:15.809
mostly in terms of time,00:06:15.809,00:06:18.719
and then definitely we will study,00:06:18.719,00:06:20.860
the implementation,00:06:20.860,00:06:22.100
in a programming language,00:06:22.100,00:06:24.330
"so we will be studying all these data
structures in the coming lessons",00:06:24.330,00:06:28.419
"and this is all for this introductory
lesson thanks for watching",00:06:28.419,00:06:31.479
