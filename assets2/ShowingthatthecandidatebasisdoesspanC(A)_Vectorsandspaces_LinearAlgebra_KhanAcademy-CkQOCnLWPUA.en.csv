"Two videos ago we asked
ourselves if we could find the",00:00:00.640,00:00:03.790
"basis for the columns
space of A.",00:00:03.790,00:00:06.150
"And I showed you a method
of how to do it.",00:00:06.150,00:00:08.440
"You literally put A in reduced
row echelon form, so this",00:00:08.440,00:00:12.580
"matrix R is just a reduced
row echelon form of A.",00:00:12.580,00:00:17.230
"And you look at its
pivot columns, so",00:00:17.230,00:00:19.040
this is a pivot column.,00:00:19.040,00:00:20.290
"It has a 1 and all 0's, this is
a pivot column, 1 and all",00:00:20.290,00:00:23.880
"0's, and the 1 is the leading
non-zero term in its row.",00:00:23.880,00:00:27.200
"And this is a pivot column, let
me circle them, these guys",00:00:27.200,00:00:29.920
"are pivot columns, and
this guy's a pivot",00:00:29.920,00:00:31.530
column right there.,00:00:31.530,00:00:32.890
"You look at those in the reduced
row echelon form of",00:00:32.890,00:00:35.200
"the matrix, and the
corresponding columns in the",00:00:35.200,00:00:37.140
"original matrix will
be your basis.",00:00:37.140,00:00:40.870
"So this guy, this guy,
so the first,",00:00:40.870,00:00:44.700
"second, and forth columns.",00:00:44.700,00:00:47.420
"So if we call this a1, this is
a2, and let's call this a4,",00:00:47.420,00:00:52.730
"this would be a3,
and this is a5.",00:00:52.730,00:00:54.980
"So we could say that a1, a2,
and a4 are a basis for the",00:00:54.980,00:01:07.410
column span of A.,00:01:07.410,00:01:10.020
"And I didn't show you
why two videos ago.",00:01:10.020,00:01:12.500
"I just said this is
how you do it.",00:01:12.500,00:01:13.960
"You have to take it as a bit
of an article of faith.",00:01:13.960,00:01:16.640
"Now in order for these
to be a basis, two",00:01:16.640,00:01:18.970
things have to be true.,00:01:18.970,00:01:21.030
"They have to be linearly
independent, and I showed you",00:01:21.030,00:01:24.770
"in the very last video, the
second in our series dealing",00:01:24.770,00:01:29.130
with this vector.,00:01:29.130,00:01:29.830
"I showed you that by the fact
that this guy is r1, this guy",00:01:29.830,00:01:34.320
"is r2, and this guy is r4, it's
clear that these guys are",00:01:34.320,00:01:39.620
linearly independent.,00:01:39.620,00:01:40.630
"They each have a 1 in a unique
entry, and the rest of their",00:01:40.630,00:01:44.290
entries are 0.,00:01:44.290,00:01:45.540
"We're looking at three pivot
columns right now, but it's",00:01:48.420,00:01:50.510
"true if we had n
pivot columns.",00:01:50.510,00:01:53.030
"That each pivot column would
have a 1 in a unique place,",00:01:53.030,00:01:55.970
"and all the other pivot
columns would",00:01:55.970,00:01:57.400
have 0 in that entry.,00:01:57.400,00:01:58.790
"So there's no way that the
other pivot columns, any",00:01:58.790,00:02:01.760
"linear combination of the other
ones, could never add up",00:02:01.760,00:02:04.150
to each of them.,00:02:04.150,00:02:05.200
"So these are definitely
linearly independent.",00:02:05.200,00:02:08.580
"And I showed you in the last
video that if we know that",00:02:08.580,00:02:11.120
"these are linearly independent,
we do know that",00:02:11.120,00:02:12.690
"they are, given that R has the
same null space as A, we know",00:02:12.690,00:02:18.250
"that these guys have to be
linearly independant, I did",00:02:18.250,00:02:20.540
that in the very last video.,00:02:20.540,00:02:22.230
"Now the next requirement for a
basis, we checked this one",00:02:22.230,00:02:25.060
"off, is to show that a1 a2 and
an, that their span equals the",00:02:25.060,00:02:41.810
column space of A.,00:02:41.810,00:02:43.750
"Now the column space of A is
a span of all five of these",00:02:43.750,00:02:46.680
"vectors, so I had to throw
a3 in there and a5.",00:02:46.680,00:02:50.960
"So to show that just these three
vectors by themselves",00:02:50.960,00:02:54.060
"span our column space, we just
have to show that I can",00:02:54.060,00:02:58.130
"represent a3 and a5 as
linear combinations",00:02:58.130,00:03:02.210
"of a1, a2, and a4.",00:03:02.210,00:03:04.950
"If I can do that, then
I can say then",00:03:04.950,00:03:08.160
these guys are redundant.,00:03:08.160,00:03:10.890
"Then the span of a1, a2, a3, a4,
and a5 doesn't need the a3",00:03:10.890,00:03:25.140
"and the a5 terms, that we can
just reduce it to this.",00:03:25.140,00:03:27.500
"Because these guys can be
represented as linear",00:03:27.500,00:03:31.790
"combinations of the
other three.",00:03:31.790,00:03:33.630
These guys are redundant.,00:03:33.630,00:03:35.340
"And if we can get rid of them
we can show that these guys",00:03:35.340,00:03:39.860
"can be represented as linear
combinations of the other,",00:03:39.860,00:03:41.850
then we can get rid of them.,00:03:41.850,00:03:42.910
"And then the span of these three
guys would be the same",00:03:42.910,00:03:45.620
"as the span of these five guys,
which is of course the",00:03:45.620,00:03:48.160
"definition of the column
space of A.",00:03:48.160,00:03:51.350
"So let's see if we
can do that.",00:03:51.350,00:03:53.430
"Let me fill in each of these
column vectors a1 through a5,",00:03:57.380,00:04:00.680
"and then each of these column
vectors let me label them r1,",00:04:00.680,00:04:03.380
"r2, r3, r4, and r5.",00:04:03.380,00:04:07.580
"Now let's explore the
null spaces again.",00:04:07.580,00:04:11.790
"Or not even the null spaces,
let's just explore the",00:04:11.790,00:04:14.600
"equations Ax is equal to -- let
me write it this way --",00:04:14.600,00:04:20.610
"instead of x let me write x1,
x2, x3, x4, x5 is equal to 0.",00:04:20.610,00:04:28.390
"This is how we define the
solution set of this.",00:04:31.050,00:04:33.650
"All the potential x1's through
x5's or all the potential",00:04:33.650,00:04:37.870
"vectors X right here, that
represents our null space.",00:04:37.870,00:04:41.480
"And then also let's explore all
of the R times x1, x2, x3,",00:04:41.480,00:04:50.490
"x4, x5's is equal to 0.",00:04:50.490,00:04:53.190
"This is the 0 vector, in which
case you would have four",00:04:53.190,00:04:56.690
"entries in this particular
case.",00:04:56.690,00:04:58.210
It would be a member of Rm.,00:04:58.210,00:05:00.260
"So these equations
can be rewritten.",00:05:00.260,00:05:02.690
"I can rewrite this as -- what
were the column vectors of A?",00:05:02.690,00:05:06.370
"They were a1, a2 through a5.",00:05:06.370,00:05:08.480
"So I can rewrite this as x1
times a1 plus x2 times a2 plus",00:05:08.480,00:05:18.090
"x3 times a3 plus x4 times
a4 plus x5 times",00:05:18.090,00:05:25.750
a5 is equal to 0.,00:05:25.750,00:05:34.070
"That was from our definition
of matrix vector",00:05:34.070,00:05:36.270
"multiplication, this is just a
bunch of column vectors a1",00:05:36.270,00:05:40.790
"through a5, I drew it up here.",00:05:40.790,00:05:44.250
"I can just rewrite this
equation like this.",00:05:44.250,00:05:46.870
"Similiarly, I can rewrite this
equation as the vector r1",00:05:46.870,00:05:51.810
"times x1 or x1 times r1 plus x2
times r2 plus x3 times r3",00:05:51.810,00:06:02.800
"plus x4 times r4 plus x5
times r5 is equal to 0.",00:06:02.800,00:06:11.820
"Now we know that when we put
this into reduced row echelon",00:06:11.820,00:06:14.690
"form the x variables that are
associated with the pivot",00:06:14.690,00:06:20.000
"columns are -- so what are the
x variables associated with",00:06:20.000,00:06:23.000
the pivot columns?,00:06:23.000,00:06:23.720
"Well, the pivot columns
are r1, r2, and r4.",00:06:23.720,00:06:26.450
"The x variables associated with
them, we can call them",00:06:31.410,00:06:35.070
"pivot variables, and the ones
that are not associated with",00:06:35.070,00:06:39.850
"our pivot columns are
free variables.",00:06:39.850,00:06:42.710
"So the free variables
in this case, x3 and",00:06:42.710,00:06:47.290
"x5, are free variables.",00:06:47.290,00:06:49.145
And that applies to A.,00:06:54.170,00:06:57.610
"All of the vectors x that
satisfy this equation also",00:06:57.610,00:07:01.410
"satisfy this equation,
and vice versa.",00:07:01.410,00:07:03.150
"They're the exact same
null space, the exact",00:07:03.150,00:07:05.910
same solution set.,00:07:05.910,00:07:07.160
"We can also call this x3 and
this x5 as free variables.",00:07:09.880,00:07:16.260
Now what does that mean?,00:07:16.260,00:07:17.130
"We've done multiple
examples of this.",00:07:17.130,00:07:19.710
"The free variables, you can set
them to anything you want.",00:07:19.710,00:07:22.740
"So x3 in this case and x5 you
can set it to any real number.",00:07:22.740,00:07:31.270
"You can set to anything
you want.",00:07:31.270,00:07:33.010
"And then from this reduced row
echelon form we express the",00:07:36.290,00:07:40.200
"other pivot variables as
functions of these guys.",00:07:40.200,00:07:43.340
"Maybe x1 is equal
to Ax3 plus Bx5.",00:07:43.340,00:07:51.340
"Maybe x2 is equal
to Cx3 plus Dx5.",00:07:51.340,00:07:57.420
"And maybe x4 is equal
to Ex3 plus Fx5.",00:07:57.420,00:08:03.750
"That comes directly out of
literally multiplying this guy",00:08:07.220,00:08:11.530
"times this equals 0, you'd get a
system of equations that you",00:08:11.530,00:08:15.010
"could solve for your pivot
variables in terms of your",00:08:15.010,00:08:18.740
free variables.,00:08:18.740,00:08:20.980
"Now given this, I want to show
you that you can always",00:08:20.980,00:08:26.390
"construct one of your -- in
your original matrix.",00:08:26.390,00:08:31.450
"So if we go to our original
matrix, you can always",00:08:31.450,00:08:34.220
"construct one of the vectors
that are associated with the",00:08:34.220,00:08:38.059
free columns.,00:08:38.059,00:08:39.260
"You can always construct one of
the free vectors using the",00:08:39.260,00:08:42.880
"linear combination of the ones
that were associated with the",00:08:42.880,00:08:45.930
pivot columns before.,00:08:45.930,00:08:47.100
And how do I do that?,00:08:47.100,00:08:48.710
"Well, let's say that I want to
find some linear combination",00:08:48.710,00:08:51.570
"that gets me to this free
column, that gets me to a3.",00:08:51.570,00:08:54.880
So how could I do that?,00:08:54.880,00:08:55.810
"Let me rearrange this
equation up here.",00:08:55.810,00:08:58.330
So what do I get?,00:08:58.330,00:08:59.580
I'm sorry.,00:09:07.970,00:09:08.210
That's x3 a3.,00:09:08.210,00:09:09.360
"If I subtract x3 a3 from both
sides of the equation, I get",00:09:09.360,00:09:13.800
"minus x3 a3 is equal to x1 a1
plus x2 a2 plus -- I don't",00:09:13.800,00:09:23.900
"have the 3 there -- plus x4 a4
plus x5 -- sorry, x isn't a",00:09:23.900,00:09:33.220
vector-- x5 a5.,00:09:33.220,00:09:34.720
"This, I guess salmon colored
statement here, is just",00:09:37.380,00:09:39.650
"another rewriting of this
equation right here.",00:09:39.650,00:09:42.800
"And all I did is I subtracted
this term right here, x3 a3,",00:09:42.800,00:09:47.620
"from both sides of
the equation.",00:09:47.620,00:09:49.900
Now x3 is a free variable.,00:09:49.900,00:09:53.410
"We can set it to anything
we want, and so is x5.",00:09:53.410,00:09:57.020
"So let's set x3 is
equal to minus 1.",00:09:57.020,00:10:00.220
"Then this term right here
becomes a 1, because that was",00:10:03.340,00:10:06.795
a minus x3.,00:10:06.795,00:10:08.170
And let's set x5 equal to 0.,00:10:08.170,00:10:10.060
"So if x5 is equal 0, this term
disappears, and I did that",00:10:13.990,00:10:16.750
because x5 is a free variable.,00:10:16.750,00:10:18.150
"I can set them to
anything I want.",00:10:18.150,00:10:20.300
"Now I've written a3 as a linear
combination of, I guess",00:10:20.300,00:10:24.960
"you could call it my potential
basis vectors right now, or",00:10:24.960,00:10:28.660
"the vectors a1, a2, and a4.",00:10:28.660,00:10:33.810
"They're the vectors in the
original matrix that were",00:10:33.810,00:10:36.130
"associated with the
pivot columns.",00:10:36.130,00:10:38.850
"Now in order to show that I can
always do this, we have to",00:10:38.850,00:10:42.070
"show that for this combination
there's always some x1, x2,",00:10:42.070,00:10:49.790
and x4 that satisfy this.,00:10:49.790,00:10:51.660
"Well, of course there's always
some x1, x2 that satisfy this,",00:10:51.660,00:10:54.260
"we just have to substitute our
free variables, x3 is equal to",00:10:54.260,00:10:57.400
"minus 3 and x5 is equal to 0,
into these equations that we",00:10:57.400,00:11:02.900
"get from our system when we did
it with the reduced row",00:11:02.900,00:11:05.210
echelon form.,00:11:05.210,00:11:06.460
"In this case you have x1 is
equal to minus A plus 0, x2 is",00:11:10.150,00:11:13.926
"equal to minus C, so
on and so forth.",00:11:13.926,00:11:16.190
So you can always do that.,00:11:16.190,00:11:19.600
"You can always express the
vectors that are associated",00:11:19.600,00:11:25.390
"with the non-pivot columns as
linear combinations of the",00:11:25.390,00:11:29.170
"vectors that are associated
with the pivot columns.",00:11:29.170,00:11:31.230
"What I just did for a3, you
could just as easily have done",00:11:31.230,00:11:35.160
"for a5 by subtracting
this term from both",00:11:35.160,00:11:38.180
sides of the equation.,00:11:38.180,00:11:39.270
"Setting x5 to negative 1 and
setting x3 to 0 so that the 3",00:11:39.270,00:11:44.260
"term disappears, and you could
run the same exact argument.",00:11:44.260,00:11:48.690
"So given that, I've hopefully
shown you, or least helped you",00:11:48.690,00:11:52.360
"see or made you comfortable
with the idea, that the",00:11:52.360,00:11:56.240
"vectors -- let me do them in a
nice vibrant color -- these",00:11:56.240,00:12:00.000
"magenta color vectors here that
are associated with the",00:12:00.000,00:12:04.480
"free columns or with the free
variables, the free variables",00:12:04.480,00:12:10.940
"were x3 and x5, those were these
columns right here, that",00:12:10.940,00:12:16.520
"they can always be expressed as
linear combinations of the",00:12:16.520,00:12:19.390
other columns.,00:12:19.390,00:12:20.150
"Because you just have to
manipulate this equation, set",00:12:20.150,00:12:23.370
"the coefficient for whatever
you're trying to find a linear",00:12:23.370,00:12:25.940
"combination for equal to minus
1, and set all the other free",00:12:25.940,00:12:29.950
"variables equal to 0 that
you're not solving for.",00:12:29.950,00:12:33.620
"And then you can get a linear
combination of the vectors",00:12:33.620,00:12:39.010
"that are associated with
the pivot columns.",00:12:39.010,00:12:41.970
"So given that, we've shown you
that these free vectors, and",00:12:41.970,00:12:45.630
"I'm using my terminology very
loosely, that these ones that",00:12:45.630,00:12:49.570
"are associated with the non
pivot columns can be expressed",00:12:49.570,00:12:52.560
"as linear combinations
of these guys.",00:12:52.560,00:12:55.300
So they're unnecessary.,00:12:55.300,00:12:56.310
"The span of this is equivalent
to the span of this, the span",00:12:56.310,00:12:59.970
"of this is the column space of
A, so the span of this is the",00:12:59.970,00:13:04.030
column space of A.,00:13:04.030,00:13:05.390
"So in the last video I showed
you that these guys are",00:13:05.390,00:13:07.250
"linearly independent, and now
I've showed you that the span",00:13:07.250,00:13:09.860
"of these guys is the
column space of A.",00:13:09.860,00:13:12.020
"So now you should be satisfied
that these vectors that are",00:13:12.020,00:13:15.270
"associated -- let me do it in
a blue color -- that that",00:13:15.270,00:13:20.860
"column vector, this column
vector, and this column",00:13:20.860,00:13:23.800
"vector, that are associated with
the pivot columns in the",00:13:23.800,00:13:27.260
"reduced row echelon form of
the matrix, do indeed",00:13:27.260,00:13:32.520
"represent a basis for the
column space of A.",00:13:32.520,00:13:36.160
"Anyway, hopefully you didn't
find that too convoluted.",00:13:36.160,00:13:39.090
