"Let's say I have an n-by-n
matrix that looks like this.",00:00:00.650,00:00:04.620
"So let me just see if I can
do it in general terms.",00:00:04.620,00:00:07.870
"In the first row and first
column, that entry has a 1,",00:00:07.870,00:00:11.010
"and then everything else, the
rest of the n minus 1 rows in",00:00:11.010,00:00:14.630
"that first column are all
going to be zeroes.",00:00:14.630,00:00:16.465
"So it's going to be zeroes all
the way down to the nth term.",00:00:16.465,00:00:20.990
"And then the second column,
we have a 0 in the first",00:00:20.990,00:00:24.630
"component, but then a 1 in
the second component.",00:00:24.630,00:00:29.060
"And then it goes zeroes
all the way down.",00:00:29.060,00:00:31.440
And you keep doing this.,00:00:31.440,00:00:34.460
"In the third row, or let me say
third column, although it",00:00:34.460,00:00:36.635
"would've applied to the third
row as well, the 1 shows up in",00:00:36.635,00:00:39.060
"the third component, and then
it's zeroes all the way down.",00:00:39.060,00:00:42.950
"Essentially, you have the ones
filling up the diagonal of",00:00:42.950,00:00:46.100
this matrix right here.,00:00:46.100,00:00:47.210
"So if you go all the way to
the nth column or the nth",00:00:47.210,00:00:50.860
"column vector, you have a bunch
of zeroes until you",00:00:50.860,00:00:53.680
"get-- you have n minus 1 zeroes,
and then the very last",00:00:53.680,00:00:56.330
"component, the nth component
there will be a 1.",00:00:56.330,00:00:58.300
"So you have essentially,
a matrix with",00:00:58.300,00:01:01.640
ones down the diagonal.,00:01:01.640,00:01:03.580
"Now, this matrix has a bunch of
neat properties and we'll",00:01:03.580,00:01:05.610
explore it more in the future.,00:01:05.610,00:01:07.070
"But I'm just exposing you to
this because it has one very",00:01:07.070,00:01:10.180
"neat property relative to
linear transformations.",00:01:10.180,00:01:13.410
"But I'm going to call this the
identity matrix and I'll call",00:01:13.410,00:01:15.950
"this I sub n, and I called that
sub n because it's an",00:01:15.950,00:01:19.550
n-by-n identity matrix.,00:01:19.550,00:01:21.690
"I sub 2 would be equal to a
2-by-2 identity matrix, so it",00:01:21.690,00:01:26.690
would look like that.,00:01:26.690,00:01:28.700
"And I sub 3 would look like
this: 1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1.",00:01:28.700,00:01:36.340
I think you get the point.,00:01:36.340,00:01:37.690
"Now, the neat thing about this
identity matrix becomes",00:01:37.690,00:01:40.390
"evident when you multiply
it times any vector.",00:01:40.390,00:01:44.650
"We can multiply this guy times
the n-component vector, a",00:01:44.650,00:01:48.660
member of Rn.,00:01:48.660,00:01:49.910
So let's do that.,00:01:49.910,00:01:51.430
"So if we multiply this
matrix times-- let's",00:01:51.430,00:01:55.720
call this vector x.,00:01:55.720,00:01:56.840
"This is x1, x2, all the way down
to xn, what is this going",00:01:56.840,00:02:02.460
to be equal to?,00:02:02.460,00:02:04.290
"So this is vector
x right here.",00:02:04.290,00:02:06.130
"So if I multiply matrix I, my
identity matrix, I sub n, and",00:02:06.130,00:02:12.430
"I multiply it times my vector x,
where x is a member of Rn,",00:02:12.430,00:02:17.410
"has n components, what
am I going to get?",00:02:17.410,00:02:20.840
"Well, I'm going to get 1 times
x1 plus 0 times x2 plus 0",00:02:20.840,00:02:25.035
"times x3 plus 0 times
x4, all of that.",00:02:25.035,00:02:26.940
"So essentially, I'm going to
have-- you can kind of view it",00:02:26.940,00:02:28.730
"as this row dotted
with the vector.",00:02:28.730,00:02:31.340
"So the only nonzero term
is going to be",00:02:31.340,00:02:32.980
the 1 times the x1.,00:02:32.980,00:02:34.200
"So it's going to be x1-- sorry,
let me do it like this.",00:02:34.200,00:02:38.330
"So you're going to get another
vector in Rn like that.",00:02:38.330,00:02:45.190
"And so the first term is that
row essentially being dotted",00:02:45.190,00:02:48.350
"with that column, and
so you just get x1.",00:02:48.350,00:02:51.440
"And then the next entry is going
to be this row, or you",00:02:51.440,00:02:57.130
"could view it as the transpose
of this row dotted with that",00:02:57.130,00:02:59.620
"column, so 0 times x1 plus
1 times x2 plus 0 times",00:02:59.620,00:03:04.090
everything else.,00:03:04.090,00:03:04.710
"So the only nonzero term
is the 1 times x2, so",00:03:04.710,00:03:07.380
you get an x2 there.,00:03:07.380,00:03:08.680
"And then you keep doing thatt,
and what are you going to get?",00:03:08.680,00:03:10.660
"You're going to get an x3
because the only nonzero term",00:03:10.660,00:03:13.470
"here is the third one and you're
going to go all the way",00:03:13.470,00:03:15.070
down until you get an xn.,00:03:15.070,00:03:17.370
"But what is this
thing equal to?",00:03:17.370,00:03:18.520
This is just equal to x.,00:03:18.520,00:03:20.690
"So the neat thing about this
identity matrix that we've",00:03:20.690,00:03:24.050
"created is that when you
multiply it times any vector,",00:03:24.050,00:03:26.780
you got the vector again.,00:03:26.780,00:03:27.850
"The identity matrix times any
vector in Rn-- it's only",00:03:27.850,00:03:31.910
"defined for vectors in Rn-- is
equal to that vector again.",00:03:31.910,00:03:37.130
"And actually, the columns of
the identity matrix have a",00:03:37.130,00:03:42.810
"special-- I guess the set of
columns has a special name.",00:03:42.810,00:03:49.240
"So if we call this first column
e1 and this second",00:03:49.240,00:03:55.610
"column e2 and the third column
e3 and we go all the way to",00:03:55.610,00:04:05.050
"en, these vectors, these column
vectors here, the set",00:04:05.050,00:04:08.670
"of these-- so let's say e1, e2,
all the way to en-- this",00:04:08.670,00:04:15.410
"is called the standard
basis for Rn.",00:04:15.410,00:04:24.390
So why is it called that?,00:04:24.390,00:04:25.410
"Well, the word basis is there,
so two things must be true.",00:04:25.410,00:04:29.000
"These things must span Rn and
they must be linearly",00:04:29.000,00:04:32.120
independent.,00:04:32.120,00:04:32.940
"It's pretty obvious from
inspection they're linearly",00:04:32.940,00:04:35.060
independent.,00:04:35.060,00:04:35.530
"If this guy has a 1 here and
no one else has a 1 there,",00:04:35.530,00:04:38.340
"there's no way you can construct
that 1 with some",00:04:38.340,00:04:40.400
"combination of the
rest of the guys.",00:04:40.400,00:04:41.600
"And you can make that same
argument for each of the ones",00:04:41.600,00:04:44.060
in each of the components.,00:04:44.060,00:04:44.805
"So it's clearly linearly
independent.",00:04:44.805,00:04:47.220
"And then to see that you can
span, that you can construct",00:04:47.220,00:04:50.620
"any vector with a linear
combination of these guys, you",00:04:50.620,00:04:55.420
"just really have to-- you know,
whatever vector you want",00:04:55.420,00:04:57.650
"to construct, if you want
to construct x1-- let",00:04:57.650,00:05:00.900
me put it this way.,00:05:00.900,00:05:01.460
"If you want to construct
this vector-- let me",00:05:01.460,00:05:04.380
write it this way.,00:05:04.380,00:05:04.980
Let me pick a different one.,00:05:04.980,00:05:06.480
"Let's say you want to construct
the vector a1, a2,",00:05:06.480,00:05:11.560
a3 all the way down to an.,00:05:11.560,00:05:13.880
"So this is some member
of Rn, you want to",00:05:13.880,00:05:15.610
construct this vector.,00:05:15.610,00:05:17.060
"Well, the linear combination
that would get you this is",00:05:17.060,00:05:20.060
"literally a1 times e1 plus a2
times e2 plus all the way to",00:05:20.060,00:05:28.370
an times en.,00:05:28.370,00:05:29.620
"This scalar times this first
column vector will essentially",00:05:32.240,00:05:37.140
"just get you-- what will
this look like?",00:05:37.140,00:05:39.200
"This will look like
a1 and then you'd",00:05:39.200,00:05:41.510
have a bunch of zeroes.,00:05:41.510,00:05:42.850
"You'd have n minus 1 zeroes plus
0 and you'd have an a2",00:05:42.850,00:05:48.060
"and then you'd have
a bunch of zeroes.",00:05:48.060,00:05:49.690
"And then you'd keep doing that,
and then you would have",00:05:49.690,00:05:53.320
"a bunch of zeroes, and then
you would have an an.",00:05:53.320,00:05:55.370
"Obviously, by our definition
of vector addition, you add",00:05:55.370,00:05:58.370
"all these things up, you get
this guy right here.",00:05:58.370,00:06:00.880
"And it's kind of obvious,
because this right here is the",00:06:00.880,00:06:04.430
"same thing as our identity
matrix times a1.",00:06:04.430,00:06:08.880
"I just wanted to expose
you to that idea.",00:06:08.880,00:06:10.930
"Now, let's apply what we already
know about linear",00:06:10.930,00:06:14.670
"transformations to what we've
just learned about this",00:06:14.670,00:06:17.450
identity matrix.,00:06:17.450,00:06:19.090
"I just told you that
I can represent",00:06:19.090,00:06:20.980
any vector like this.,00:06:20.980,00:06:23.210
"Let me rewrite it in
maybe terms of x.",00:06:23.210,00:06:25.180
"I can write any vector x as a
linear combination of the",00:06:25.180,00:06:32.940
"standard basis, which are really
just the columns of the",00:06:32.940,00:06:36.210
identity matrix.,00:06:36.210,00:06:37.310
"I can write that as x1 times e1
plus x2 times e2, all the",00:06:37.310,00:06:43.060
way to xn times en.,00:06:43.060,00:06:45.430
"And remember, each of these
column vectors right here,",00:06:45.430,00:06:49.430
"like for e1, is just 1 in the
first entry and then all the",00:06:49.430,00:06:54.820
"rest are zeroes. e2 is a 1
in the second entry and",00:06:54.820,00:06:57.020
everything else is 0.,00:06:57.020,00:06:59.410
"e5 is a 1 in the fifth entry
and everything else is 0.",00:06:59.410,00:07:03.050
"And this I just showed you, and
this is a bit obvious from",00:07:03.050,00:07:05.270
this right here.,00:07:05.270,00:07:06.290
"Now, we know that by definition,
a linear",00:07:06.290,00:07:09.520
"transformation of x-- let
me put it this way.",00:07:09.520,00:07:20.680
"A linear transformation of x,
of our vector x, is the same",00:07:20.680,00:07:25.350
"thing as taking the linear
transformation of this whole",00:07:25.350,00:07:27.440
"thing-- let me do it in another
color-- is equal to",00:07:27.440,00:07:29.550
"the linear transformation of--
actually, instead of using L,",00:07:29.550,00:07:38.050
let me use T.,00:07:38.050,00:07:38.740
"I used L by accident because
I was thinking linear.",00:07:38.740,00:07:42.290
"But if I were take the linear
transformation of x, because",00:07:42.290,00:07:45.930
"that's the notation we're used
to, that's the same thing as",00:07:45.930,00:07:48.540
"taking a linear transformation
of this thing.",00:07:48.540,00:07:50.830
They're equivalent.,00:07:50.830,00:07:51.840
"So x1 times e1 plus x2 times
e2, all the way to",00:07:51.840,00:07:58.510
plus xn times en.,00:07:58.510,00:08:01.800
It's equivalent statements.,00:08:01.800,00:08:03.340
"Now, from the definition of
linear transformations, we",00:08:03.340,00:08:06.750
"know that this is the same
thing, that the transformation",00:08:06.750,00:08:09.330
"of the sum is equal to the sum
of the transformation.",00:08:09.330,00:08:12.230
"So this is equal to the
transformation of x1 e1 plus",00:08:12.230,00:08:18.800
"the transformation of x2 e2
where this is just any linear",00:08:18.800,00:08:22.850
transformation.,00:08:22.850,00:08:23.510
Let me make that very clear.,00:08:23.510,00:08:24.670
"This is any linear
transformation.",00:08:24.670,00:08:26.660
"By definition, linear
transformations have to",00:08:30.860,00:08:33.230
satisfy these properties.,00:08:33.230,00:08:34.850
"So the transformation times
x2 e2, all the way to this",00:08:34.850,00:08:39.289
"transformation times this last
entry, the scalar xn times my",00:08:39.289,00:08:43.940
standard basis vector en.,00:08:43.940,00:08:47.320
"And we know from the other
property of linear",00:08:47.320,00:08:49.190
"transformations that the
transformation of a vector",00:08:49.190,00:08:53.220

same thing as the scalar",00:08:53.220,00:08:58.690
"multiplied by the transformation
of the vector.",00:08:58.690,00:09:04.390
"That's just from our definition
of linear",00:09:04.390,00:09:05.950
transformations.,00:09:05.950,00:09:06.630
"Plus x2 two times the
transformation of e2 plus all",00:09:06.630,00:09:12.580
"the way to xn times the
transformation of en.",00:09:12.580,00:09:19.560
"Now, what is this?",00:09:19.560,00:09:20.730
"I could rewrite this, so
everything I've done so far,",00:09:20.730,00:09:23.860
"so the transformation of x is
equal to that, which just",00:09:23.860,00:09:28.280
"using our properties of linear
transformations, all linear",00:09:28.280,00:09:31.170
"transformations, this has
to be true for them.",00:09:31.170,00:09:33.780
"I get to this and this
is equivalent.",00:09:33.780,00:09:36.410
"This is equal to-- if we view
each of these as a column",00:09:36.410,00:09:40.600
"vector, this is equal to what?",00:09:40.600,00:09:45.350
"This is equal to the matrix
where this is the first",00:09:45.350,00:09:49.140
"column, T e1.",00:09:49.140,00:09:53.300
"And then the second
column is T e2.",00:09:53.300,00:09:56.960
"And then we go all the way to
T en times-- let me put it",00:09:56.960,00:10:03.970
"this way-- x1, x2, all
the way to xn.",00:10:03.970,00:10:07.640
"We've seen this multiple,
multiple times.",00:10:07.640,00:10:10.090
"Now what's really, really,
really neat about this is I",00:10:10.090,00:10:13.290
"just started with an arbitrary
transformation.",00:10:13.290,00:10:16.270
"And I just showed that
an arbitrary linear",00:10:16.270,00:10:19.520
"transformation of x can be
rewritten as a product of a",00:10:19.520,00:10:23.350
"matrix where I'm taking that
same linear transformation of",00:10:23.350,00:10:27.460
"each of our standard basis
vectors, and I can construct",00:10:27.460,00:10:31.320
"that matrix, and multiplying
that matrix times my x vector",00:10:31.320,00:10:34.480
"is the same thing as this
transformation.",00:10:34.480,00:10:36.770
"So this is essentially showing
you that all transformations--",00:10:36.770,00:10:42.000
let me be careful.,00:10:42.000,00:10:42.940
"All linear transformations can
be a matrix vector product.",00:10:42.940,00:10:53.500
"Not only did I show you that
you can do it, but it's",00:10:53.500,00:10:55.540
"actually a fairly
straightforward thing to do.",00:10:55.540,00:10:57.430
"This is actually a pretty
simple operation to do.",00:10:57.430,00:11:01.340
Let me show you an example.,00:11:01.340,00:11:04.960
"I don't know, I think
this is super neat.",00:11:04.960,00:11:06.700
"Let's say that I just-- I'm
just going to make up some",00:11:06.700,00:11:08.810
transformation.,00:11:08.810,00:11:09.610
"Let's say I have a
transformation and it's a",00:11:09.610,00:11:11.650
"mapping between-- let's make
it extra interesting--",00:11:11.650,00:11:14.720
between R2 and R3.,00:11:14.720,00:11:18.580
"And let's say my transformation,
let's say that",00:11:18.580,00:11:22.090
"T of x1 x2 is equal to-- let's
say the first entry is x1 plus",00:11:22.090,00:11:30.030
"3x2, the second entry is 5x2
minus x1, and let's say the",00:11:30.030,00:11:37.620
third entry is 4x1 plus x2.,00:11:37.620,00:11:43.390
This is a mapping.,00:11:43.390,00:11:44.190
"I could have written
it like this.",00:11:44.190,00:11:45.150
"I could write T of any vector
in R2, x1, x2, is equal to--",00:11:45.150,00:11:52.620
"and maybe this is just
redundant, but I",00:11:52.620,00:11:54.560
think you get the idea.,00:11:54.560,00:11:55.500
"I like this notation better. x1
plus 3x2, 5x2 minus x1, and",00:11:55.500,00:12:02.520
then 4x1 plus x2.,00:12:02.520,00:12:05.080
"This statement and this
statement I just wrote are",00:12:05.080,00:12:07.650
equivalent.,00:12:07.650,00:12:07.830
"And I like to visualize this
a little bit more.",00:12:07.830,00:12:10.060
"Now, I just told you that
I can represent this",00:12:10.060,00:12:12.030
"transformation as a matrix
vector product.",00:12:12.030,00:12:15.330
How do I do it?,00:12:15.330,00:12:16.360
"Well, what I do is I take the
transformation of this guy.",00:12:16.360,00:12:20.530
"My domain right here is R2, and
I produce a vector that's",00:12:20.530,00:12:25.260
going to be in Rn.,00:12:25.260,00:12:26.610
"So what I do is, let's see.",00:12:26.610,00:12:28.330
"So I'm concerned with
multiplying things times",00:12:28.330,00:12:33.320
vectors in R2.,00:12:33.320,00:12:34.840
"So what we're going to do is
we're going to start with the",00:12:34.840,00:12:37.940
"identity matrix, identity 2
because that's my domain and",00:12:37.940,00:12:42.350
"it just looks like
this: 1, 0, 0, 1.",00:12:42.350,00:12:47.300
"I'm just going to
start with that.",00:12:47.300,00:12:48.770
"And all I do is I apply my
transformation to each of the",00:12:48.770,00:12:51.940
"columns, each of my
standard bases.",00:12:51.940,00:12:54.340
"These are the standard
bases for R2.",00:12:54.340,00:12:56.095
"I showed you that they're bases,
how do I know that",00:13:00.150,00:13:01.960
they're standard?,00:13:01.960,00:13:03.110
"Why are they called the
standard bases?",00:13:03.110,00:13:05.080
"And I haven't covered this in a
lot of detail right yet, but",00:13:05.080,00:13:07.560
"you could take the dot product
of any of these guys with any",00:13:07.560,00:13:11.210
"of the other guys, and you'll
see that they're all",00:13:11.210,00:13:12.620
orthogonal to each other.,00:13:12.620,00:13:13.660
"The dot product of any one of
these columns with the other",00:13:13.660,00:13:15.510
"is always zero, so that's
a nice clue.",00:13:15.510,00:13:18.000
"And they all have length of 1,
so that's a nice reason why",00:13:18.000,00:13:21.230
"they're called the
standard bases.",00:13:21.230,00:13:22.530
"But anyway, back to our attempt
to represent this",00:13:22.530,00:13:26.240
"transformation as a matrix
vector product.",00:13:26.240,00:13:29.190
"So we say look, our domain is in
R2, so let's start with I2,",00:13:29.190,00:13:34.000
"or we could call it our 2-by-2
identity matrix.",00:13:34.000,00:13:38.450
"And let's apply the
transformation to each of its",00:13:38.450,00:13:41.280
"column vectors where each of
its column vectors are a",00:13:41.280,00:13:43.850
"vector in the standard
basis for R2.",00:13:43.850,00:13:45.750
"So I'm going to write
it like this.",00:13:50.630,00:13:54.900
"The first column is T of this
column, and then the second",00:13:54.900,00:13:58.790
"column is going to
be T of 0, 1.",00:13:58.790,00:14:05.910
"And I know I'm getting messier
with my handwriting.",00:14:05.910,00:14:09.860
"What is T of the vector 1, 0?",00:14:09.860,00:14:15.160
"Well, we just go here.",00:14:15.160,00:14:16.670
We construct another vector.,00:14:16.670,00:14:18.690
"So we get 1 plus
3 times 0 is 1.",00:14:18.690,00:14:22.540
"Then we get 5 times 0 minus
1, so that's minus 1.",00:14:22.540,00:14:27.930
x2 is zero in this case.,00:14:27.930,00:14:29.740
"And then we get 4 times 1 plus
0, so that's just 4.",00:14:29.740,00:14:35.820
"So that's T of 1, 0.",00:14:35.820,00:14:37.850
"And then what is T of 0, 1?",00:14:37.850,00:14:46.500
"T of 0, 1 is equal to-- so we
have 0 plus 3 times 1 is 3.",00:14:46.500,00:14:53.410
"Then we have 0 minus
1 is minus 1.",00:14:53.410,00:14:59.260
"Let me make sure I did
this one right.",00:14:59.260,00:15:00.930
What was this?,00:15:00.930,00:15:01.540
This was 5 times 1 minus 1.,00:15:01.540,00:15:03.860
"Yeah, 5 times 0 minus
x1, which is 1.",00:15:06.400,00:15:10.750
"Now, this case, it's 5 times--
oh, I have to be careful.",00:15:10.750,00:15:15.280
This is 5 times x2.,00:15:15.280,00:15:16.960
x2 is 1.,00:15:16.960,00:15:17.510
"So 5 times 1 minus
0, so it's 5.",00:15:17.510,00:15:22.970
"And then I have 4 times
0 plus x2, plus 1.",00:15:22.970,00:15:28.490
"And I just showed you if I
replace each of these standard",00:15:28.490,00:15:31.820
"basis vectors with the
transformation of",00:15:31.820,00:15:33.910
"them, what do I get?",00:15:33.910,00:15:35.550
I get this vector right here.,00:15:35.550,00:15:37.860
"So I already figured
out what they are.",00:15:37.860,00:15:39.410
"If I take this guy and evaluate
it, it's the vector",00:15:42.690,00:15:45.280
"1, minus 1, 4.",00:15:45.280,00:15:48.250
"And then this guy is the
vector 3, 5, and 1.",00:15:48.250,00:15:54.620
"So what we just did and this
is-- I don't know.",00:15:54.620,00:15:57.410
"For some reason, I find this
to be pretty amazing.",00:15:57.410,00:15:59.790
"We can now rewrite this
transformation here as the",00:15:59.790,00:16:03.800
product of any vector.,00:16:03.800,00:16:05.720
"So if we define this to be equal
to a, or we could write",00:16:05.720,00:16:09.770
it this way.,00:16:09.770,00:16:10.290
"We can now write our
transformation.",00:16:10.290,00:16:12.210
"Our transformation of x1, x2
can now be rewritten as the",00:16:12.210,00:16:17.950
product of this vector.,00:16:17.950,00:16:20.430
I'll write it in green.,00:16:20.430,00:16:22.070
"The vector 1, 3, minus 1, 5, 4,
1 times our input vector,",00:16:22.070,00:16:31.720
"x1, x2, which is super cool
because now we just have to do",00:16:31.720,00:16:36.200
a matrix multiplication.,00:16:36.200,00:16:37.660
"Instead of this, and if we have
some processor that does",00:16:37.660,00:16:39.770
"this super fast, we
can then use that.",00:16:39.770,00:16:42.920
"I don't know, I think this is
especially elegant, because",00:16:42.920,00:16:46.050
"what happens here is we applied
the transformations to",00:16:46.050,00:16:49.310
"each of the columns of a 2-by-2
matrix, and we got a",00:16:49.310,00:16:52.090
3-by-2 matrix.,00:16:52.090,00:16:55.620
"And we know what happens when
you multiply a 3-by-2 matrix",00:16:55.620,00:16:58.380
times a vector that's in R2.,00:16:58.380,00:17:00.550
"Or you can almost view this
as a 2-by-1 matrix.",00:17:00.550,00:17:05.420
"You're going to get a vector
that is in R3.",00:17:05.420,00:17:09.579
"Because you're going to have
these guys times that guy's",00:17:09.579,00:17:11.790
going to be the first term.,00:17:11.790,00:17:12.609
"These guys times these
guys are going to",00:17:12.609,00:17:13.846
be the second term.,00:17:13.846,00:17:14.800
"These guys times those
guys are going to",00:17:14.800,00:17:16.230
be the third term.,00:17:16.230,00:17:17.569
"So by kind of creating this
3-by-2 matrix, we have",00:17:17.569,00:17:22.040
"actually created a mapping
from R2 to R3.",00:17:22.040,00:17:25.510
"Anyway, for some reason I find
this to be especially neat.",00:17:25.510,00:17:28.470
"Hopefully, at least you find
this somewhat instructive.",00:17:28.470,00:17:31.470
