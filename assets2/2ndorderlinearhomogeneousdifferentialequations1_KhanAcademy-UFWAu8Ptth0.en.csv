"We'll now move from the world
of first order differential",00:00:00.760,00:00:04.200
"equations to the world
of second order",00:00:04.200,00:00:06.400
differential equations.,00:00:06.400,00:00:07.280
And what does that mean?,00:00:07.280,00:00:07.800
"That means that we're now going
to start involving the",00:00:07.800,00:00:10.450
second derivative.,00:00:10.450,00:00:11.600
"And the first class that I'm
going to show you-- and this",00:00:11.600,00:00:13.510
"is probably the most useful
class when you're studying",00:00:13.510,00:00:16.360
"classical physics-- are
linear second order",00:00:16.360,00:00:19.990
differential equations.,00:00:19.990,00:00:21.080
"So what is a linear second order
differential equation?",00:00:21.080,00:00:23.150
"I think I touched on it a little
bit in our very first",00:00:23.150,00:00:27.210
intro video.,00:00:27.210,00:00:27.760
"But it's something that
looks like this.",00:00:27.760,00:00:29.820
"If I have a of x-- so some
function only of x-- times the",00:00:29.820,00:00:35.270
"second derivative of y, with
respect to x, plus b of x,",00:00:35.270,00:00:42.110
"times the first derivative of
y, with respect to x, plus c",00:00:42.110,00:00:47.420
"of x, times y is equal to some
function that's only a",00:00:47.420,00:00:56.200
function of x.,00:00:56.200,00:00:59.140
"So just to review our
terminology, y is the second",00:00:59.140,00:01:01.760
"order because the highest
derivative here is the second",00:01:01.760,00:01:04.910
"derivative, so that makes
it second order.",00:01:04.910,00:01:08.170
And what makes it linear?,00:01:08.170,00:01:10.220
"Well all of the coefficients
on-- and I want to be careful",00:01:10.220,00:01:13.770
"with the term coefficients,
because traditionally we view",00:01:13.770,00:01:15.950
"coefficients as always being
constants-- but here we have",00:01:15.950,00:01:21.760
"functions of x as
coefficients.",00:01:21.760,00:01:23.880
"So in order for this to be a
linear differential equation,",00:01:23.880,00:01:26.550
"a of x, b of x, c of x and d
of x, they all have to be",00:01:26.550,00:01:30.120
"functions only of x, as
I've drawn it here.",00:01:30.120,00:01:33.770
"And now, before we start
trying to solve this",00:01:33.770,00:01:36.580
"generally, we'll do a special
case of this, where a, b, c",00:01:36.580,00:01:41.730
are constants and d is 0.,00:01:41.730,00:01:44.190
So what will that look like?,00:01:44.190,00:01:45.890
"So I can just rewrite that as
A-- so now A is not a function",00:01:45.890,00:01:51.100
"anymore, it's just a number-- A
times the second derivative",00:01:51.100,00:01:55.790
"of y, with respect to x, plus B
times the first derivative,",00:01:55.790,00:02:02.070
plus C times y.,00:02:02.070,00:02:05.230
"And instead of having just a
fourth constant, instead of d",00:02:05.230,00:02:09.600
"of x, I'm just going to
set that equal to 0.",00:02:09.600,00:02:13.670
"And by setting this equal to 0,
I have now introduced you",00:02:13.670,00:02:18.090
"to the other form
of homogeneous",00:02:18.090,00:02:21.010
differential equation.,00:02:21.010,00:02:22.180
"And this one is called
homogeneous.",00:02:22.180,00:02:23.890
"And I haven't made the
connection yet on how these",00:02:23.890,00:02:27.490
"second order differential
equations are related to the",00:02:27.490,00:02:30.830
"first order ones that I just
introduced-- to these other",00:02:30.830,00:02:33.200
"homogeneous differential
equations I introduced you to.",00:02:33.200,00:02:35.130
"I think they just happen to
have the same name, even",00:02:35.130,00:02:37.720
"though they're not
that related.",00:02:37.720,00:02:39.700
"So the reason why this one is
called homogeneous is because",00:02:39.700,00:02:43.350
you have it equal to 0.,00:02:43.350,00:02:45.920
"So this is what makes
it homogeneous.",00:02:45.920,00:02:47.750
"And actually, I do see more of a
connection between this type",00:02:47.750,00:02:51.250
"of equation and milk where all
the fat is spread out, because",00:02:51.250,00:02:56.000
"if you think about it, the
solution for all homogeneous",00:02:56.000,00:02:59.320
"equations, when you kind of
solve the equation, they",00:02:59.320,00:03:03.295
always equal 0.,00:03:03.295,00:03:04.240
"So they're homogenized, I guess
is the best way that I",00:03:04.240,00:03:08.010
can draw any kind of parallel.,00:03:08.010,00:03:10.950
"So we could call this a second
order linear because A, B, and",00:03:10.950,00:03:17.390
"C definitely are functions just
of-- well, they're not",00:03:17.390,00:03:20.290
"even functions of x or y,
they're just constants.",00:03:20.290,00:03:22.310
"So second order linear
homogeneous-- because they",00:03:22.310,00:03:26.445
"equal 0-- differential
equations.",00:03:26.445,00:03:28.800
"And I think you'll see that
these, in some ways, are the",00:03:28.800,00:03:31.420
"most fun differential
equations to solve.",00:03:31.420,00:03:34.240
"And actually, often the most
useful because in a lot of the",00:03:34.240,00:03:36.470
"applications of classical
mechanics, this is all you",00:03:36.470,00:03:38.760
need to solve.,00:03:38.760,00:03:40.420
"But they're the most fun to
solve because they all boil",00:03:40.420,00:03:42.820
"down to Algebra II problems.
And I'll touch",00:03:42.820,00:03:45.660
on that in a second.,00:03:45.660,00:03:46.960
"But let's just think about
this a little bit.",00:03:46.960,00:03:48.660
"Think about what the
properties of these",00:03:48.660,00:03:50.180
solutions might be.,00:03:50.180,00:03:51.130
"Let me just throw
out something.",00:03:51.130,00:03:52.870
"Let's say that g of
x is a solution.",00:03:52.870,00:04:01.500
"So that means that A times g
prime prime, plus B times g",00:04:05.590,00:04:12.650
"prime, plus C times
g is equal to 0.",00:04:12.650,00:04:17.839
Right?,00:04:17.839,00:04:18.550
These mean the same thing.,00:04:18.550,00:04:20.200
"Now, my question to you is,
what if I have some",00:04:20.200,00:04:22.490
constant times g?,00:04:22.490,00:04:24.040
Is that still a solution?,00:04:24.040,00:04:27.170
"So my question is, let's say
some constant c1 gx-- c1 times",00:04:27.170,00:04:32.620
g-- is this a solution?,00:04:32.620,00:04:35.860
"Well, let's try it out.",00:04:35.860,00:04:36.560
"Let's substitute this into
our original equation.",00:04:36.560,00:04:39.610
"So A times the second derivative
of this would just",00:04:39.610,00:04:42.770
"be-- and I'll switch colors
here; let me switch to brown--",00:04:42.770,00:04:49.000
"so A times the second derivative
of this would be--",00:04:49.000,00:04:52.970
"the constant, every time you
take a derivative, the",00:04:52.970,00:04:54.770
"constant just carries over-- so
that'll just be A times c1",00:04:54.770,00:05:00.900
"g prime prime, plus-- the
same thing for the first",00:05:00.900,00:05:05.640
"derivative-- B times c1 g prime,
plus C-- and this C is",00:05:05.640,00:05:14.190
"different than the
c1 c-- times g.",00:05:14.190,00:05:18.430
"And let's see whether
this is equal to 0.",00:05:18.430,00:05:21.360
"So we could factor out that c1
constant, and we get c1 times",00:05:21.360,00:05:27.190
"Ag prime prime, plus
Bg prime, plus Cg.",00:05:27.190,00:05:37.130
"And lo and behold,
we already know.",00:05:37.130,00:05:38.460
"Because we know that g of
x is a solution, we know",00:05:38.460,00:05:40.950
that this is true.,00:05:40.950,00:05:42.130
"So this is going to
be equal to 0.",00:05:42.130,00:05:45.080
Because g is a solution.,00:05:45.080,00:05:47.440
"So if this is 0, c1 times 0
is going to be equal to 0.",00:05:47.440,00:05:53.060
"So this expression up here
is also equal to 0.",00:05:53.060,00:05:56.610
"Or another way to view it is
that if g is a solution to",00:05:56.610,00:05:59.870
"this second order linear
homogeneous differential",00:05:59.870,00:06:03.720
"equation, then some constant
times g is also a solution.",00:06:03.720,00:06:07.790
"So this is also a solution to
the differential equation.",00:06:07.790,00:06:12.770
"And then the next property I
want to show you-- and this is",00:06:12.770,00:06:14.840
"all going someplace,
don't worry.",00:06:14.840,00:06:17.110
"The next question I want to ask
you is, OK, we know that g",00:06:17.110,00:06:20.410
"of x is a solution to the
differential equation.",00:06:20.410,00:06:23.010
"What if I were to also
tell you that h",00:06:23.010,00:06:24.510
of x is also a solution?,00:06:24.510,00:06:28.090
"So my question to you is, is g
of x plus h of x a solution?",00:06:32.900,00:06:42.700
"If you add these two functions
that are both solutions, if",00:06:45.200,00:06:49.330
"you add them together, is that
still a solution of our",00:06:49.330,00:06:52.400
"original differential
equation?",00:06:52.400,00:06:53.970
"Well, let's substitute this
whole thing into our original",00:06:53.970,00:06:56.150
"differential equation, right?",00:06:56.150,00:06:58.090
"So we'll have A times
the second",00:06:58.090,00:07:00.620
derivative of this thing.,00:07:00.620,00:07:03.430
"Well, that's straightforward
enough.",00:07:03.430,00:07:05.590
"That's just g prime prime, plus
h prime prime, plus B",00:07:05.590,00:07:11.580
"times-- the first derivative of
this thing-- g prime plus h",00:07:11.580,00:07:16.500
"prime, plus C times-- this
function-- g plus h.",00:07:16.500,00:07:25.370
And now what can we do?,00:07:25.370,00:07:26.200
"Let's distribute all
of these constants.",00:07:26.200,00:07:27.880
"We get A times g prime prime,
plus A times h prime prime,",00:07:27.880,00:07:34.440
"plus B times the first
derivative of g, plus B times",00:07:34.440,00:07:38.320
"the first derivative of
h, plus C times g,",00:07:38.320,00:07:42.270
plus C times h.,00:07:42.270,00:07:44.510
And now we can rearrange them.,00:07:44.510,00:07:46.350
"And we get A-- let's take this
one; let's take all the g",00:07:46.350,00:07:49.580
"terms-- A times the second
derivative of g, plus B times",00:07:49.580,00:07:54.140
"the first derivative, plus C
times g-- that's these three",00:07:54.140,00:07:59.930
"terms-- plus A times the second
derivative of h, plus B",00:07:59.930,00:08:07.090
"times the first derivative,
plus C times h.",00:08:07.090,00:08:12.040
"And now we know that both g
and h are solutions of the",00:08:12.040,00:08:14.890
"original differential
equation.",00:08:14.890,00:08:16.130
"So by definition, if g is a
solution of the original",00:08:16.130,00:08:21.390
"differential equation, and this
was the left-hand side of",00:08:21.390,00:08:23.350
"that differential equation, this
is going to be equal to",00:08:23.350,00:08:25.850
"0, and so is this going
to be equal to 0.",00:08:25.850,00:08:32.520
"So we've shown that this whole
expression is equal to 0.",00:08:32.520,00:08:35.429
"So if g is a solution of the
differential equation-- of",00:08:35.429,00:08:38.789
"this second order linear
homogeneous differential",00:08:38.789,00:08:41.480
"equation-- and h is also a
solution, then if you were to",00:08:41.480,00:08:45.110
"add them together, the sum of
them is also a solution.",00:08:45.110,00:08:49.720
"So in general, if we show that
g is a solution and h is a",00:08:49.720,00:08:53.070
"solution, you can add them.",00:08:53.070,00:08:54.820
"And we showed before that
any constant times",00:08:54.820,00:08:57.490
them is also a solution.,00:08:57.490,00:08:59.020
"So you could also say that some
constant times g of x",00:08:59.020,00:09:04.590
"plus some constant times h
of x is also a solution.",00:09:04.590,00:09:10.270
"And maybe the constant
in one of the",00:09:10.270,00:09:12.150
cases is 0 or something.,00:09:12.150,00:09:13.560
I don't know.,00:09:13.560,00:09:14.290
"But anyway, these are useful
properties to maybe",00:09:14.290,00:09:19.350
"internalize for second order
homogeneous linear",00:09:19.350,00:09:23.290
differential equations.,00:09:23.290,00:09:24.560
"And in the next video, we're
actually going to apply these",00:09:24.560,00:09:26.600
"properties to figure out the
solutions for these.",00:09:26.600,00:09:29.660
"And you'll see that they're
actually straightforward.",00:09:29.660,00:09:32.190
"I would say a lot easier than
what we did in the previous",00:09:32.190,00:09:35.690
"first order homogeneous
difference equations, or the",00:09:35.690,00:09:38.070
exact equations.,00:09:38.070,00:09:39.020
"This is much, much easier.",00:09:39.020,00:09:40.310
"I'll see you in the
next video.",00:09:40.310,00:09:42.550
