"Let me graph our coordinates
in R2.",00:00:00.670,00:00:03.250
"So let's see, let me do
it fairly neatly.",00:00:03.250,00:00:06.512
"I want to do it neater
than that.",00:00:06.512,00:00:09.160
"So that is my vertical
coordinate, this is my",00:00:09.160,00:00:13.990
horizontal coordinate.,00:00:13.990,00:00:16.149
Good enough.,00:00:16.149,00:00:16.640
"So let's say I have four points
in R2 specified by four",00:00:16.640,00:00:20.450
position vectors.,00:00:20.450,00:00:21.445
So this is R2 right here.,00:00:21.445,00:00:23.390
"So my first position vector
is the zero vector.",00:00:23.390,00:00:26.990
"So it just specifies the point
right there, so it's 0, 0.",00:00:26.990,00:00:31.050
"My second point is specified the
by the vector say k 1, 0,",00:00:31.050,00:00:40.720
so some constant times 0.,00:00:40.720,00:00:42.720
"Let me write it a little
bit neater than that,",00:00:42.720,00:00:44.210
a little bit bigger.,00:00:44.210,00:00:46.020
"So it's k 1, 0, so that's my
second position vector, which",00:00:46.020,00:00:50.960
"would specify that point
right there.",00:00:50.960,00:00:53.220
"So let me draw my vector
right there.",00:00:53.220,00:00:56.010
"Let's say my third point
is going to be up here.",00:00:56.010,00:01:01.190
"As you can, see I'm creating
a rectangle.",00:01:01.190,00:01:03.672
"Let's say it's specified
by the position vector.",00:01:03.672,00:01:06.720
"Let me draw the position
vector like that.",00:01:06.720,00:01:09.190
"And that position vector is
going to be the vector k1.",00:01:09.190,00:01:13.700
"That's going to be its
horizontal component and then",00:01:13.700,00:01:17.020
k2 is its vertical component.,00:01:17.020,00:01:20.480
"If we wanted to graph it on the
coordinates, this would be",00:01:20.480,00:01:23.005
the k2 coordinate right there.,00:01:23.005,00:01:25.140
"And let's say that the last
point is this point right",00:01:25.140,00:01:29.870
"here, and it is specified by
the position vector 0, k2.",00:01:29.870,00:01:39.400
And let me define a set.,00:01:39.400,00:01:42.290
Let me call that set,00:01:42.290,00:01:43.770
"rectangle, say R for rectangle.",00:01:43.770,00:01:45.955
Let me just call it Rec.,00:01:45.955,00:01:48.310
"Let's say that rectangle is
equal to the set of all of the",00:01:48.310,00:01:51.680
"points when you connect the
points specified by those",00:01:51.680,00:01:55.260
position vectors.,00:01:55.260,00:01:56.710
"So the rectangle formed by
connecting points specified by",00:01:56.710,00:02:17.580
these guys here.,00:02:17.580,00:02:18.440
"So if we call this vector a,
this is vector b, this is",00:02:18.440,00:02:23.760
"vector c, and then this is
vector d right here, so",00:02:23.760,00:02:28.750
"rectangle specified
by connecting the",00:02:28.750,00:02:31.090
"points a, b, c and d.",00:02:31.090,00:02:38.590
"Now let's say-- so let me draw
what our set rectangle is",00:02:38.590,00:02:43.500
going to be.,00:02:43.500,00:02:44.000
"It's going to be all of these
points here, all of these",00:02:44.000,00:02:47.500
"points there, all of those
points there, and then all of",00:02:47.500,00:02:50.960
"those points there, including
our vertices.",00:02:50.960,00:02:55.990
So that is my rectangle.,00:02:55.990,00:02:59.670
"Now, what is the area within
this rectangle?",00:02:59.670,00:03:03.230
"So this is the area
of rectangle.",00:03:03.230,00:03:09.610
"What's the area within
this rectangle?",00:03:09.610,00:03:11.750
"Well, it's just base
times height.",00:03:11.750,00:03:13.680
The base has length k1.,00:03:13.680,00:03:16.330
"The distance from here to here
is k1, so it's just k1.",00:03:16.330,00:03:19.370
And what's the height?,00:03:19.370,00:03:20.390
"It's the distance from here
to here, which is just k2.",00:03:20.390,00:03:22.470
So it's just k1 times k2.,00:03:22.470,00:03:25.820
That's fairly straightforward.,00:03:25.820,00:03:27.310
"I haven't shown you anything
that fascinating just yet.",00:03:27.310,00:03:30.390
"But let's say we're going
to transform this set.",00:03:30.390,00:03:33.280
"We're going to transform this
rectangle and we're going to",00:03:33.280,00:03:35.540
"transform it with the
transformation T.",00:03:35.540,00:03:39.870
"Let me pick a nice
color for T.",00:03:39.870,00:03:42.290
"Let's say we have the
transformation T.",00:03:42.290,00:03:44.760
"It is a mapping from R2 to R2,
and it can be represented as--",00:03:44.760,00:03:50.540
"so when you apply the
transformation T to some",00:03:50.540,00:03:53.100
"vector x, it is equal to the
matrix a, b, c, d times your",00:03:53.100,00:04:01.960
"vector x, just like that.",00:04:01.960,00:04:04.410
"Now, let's see what happens
when we apply the",00:04:04.410,00:04:06.440
"transformation to each
of these points.",00:04:06.440,00:04:08.560
"We saw many videos ago that if
you want essentially the image",00:04:08.560,00:04:12.140
"of our rectangle under this
transformation, you can",00:04:12.140,00:04:15.880
"essentially just get the
transformation of each of the",00:04:15.880,00:04:17.860
"end points and then connect
the dots in your codomain,",00:04:17.860,00:04:21.200
which is also going to be R2.,00:04:21.200,00:04:22.610
"So we just have to figure out
the transformation of each of",00:04:22.610,00:04:24.820
these guys.,00:04:24.820,00:04:26.020
So what is my transformation?,00:04:26.020,00:04:28.430
I'll do it over here.,00:04:28.430,00:04:29.740
I'll do it in the colors.,00:04:29.740,00:04:31.670
"What is the transformation
applied to the zero vector,",00:04:31.670,00:04:35.910
"applied to point
a right there?",00:04:35.910,00:04:38.270
"Well, it's just going to be
a times 0 plus b times 0,",00:04:38.270,00:04:43.860
which is just 0.,00:04:43.860,00:04:46.050
"And then the second term is
going to be c times 0 plus d",00:04:46.050,00:04:49.010
"times 0, which is just 0.",00:04:49.010,00:04:52.010
That's vector a.,00:04:52.010,00:04:54.530
Vector b.,00:04:54.530,00:04:57.260
"If I apply the transformation
to vector b, vector b is k1,",00:04:57.260,00:05:02.100
"0, just like that.",00:05:02.100,00:05:03.740
"If I apply the transformation,
it's going to be a times k--",00:05:03.740,00:05:07.210
"so the first entry in the
transformed vector or what",00:05:07.210,00:05:11.610
"we're mapping to in our codomain
is going to be a",00:05:11.610,00:05:13.880
"times k1 plus b times
0, so it's just ak1.",00:05:13.880,00:05:19.300
"And then the second entry's
going to be c times k1",00:05:19.300,00:05:21.980
plus d times 0.,00:05:21.980,00:05:24.400
"So it's going to
be c times k1.",00:05:24.400,00:05:27.390
"All I'm doing is taking the
matrix vector product of this",00:05:27.390,00:05:29.900
guy and that guy.,00:05:29.900,00:05:31.970
"And then let's move
on to point c.",00:05:31.970,00:05:35.330
"So the transformation of point
c of k1, k2 is equal to-- or",00:05:35.330,00:05:45.330
"the transformation of
vector c, we could",00:05:45.330,00:05:46.910
"say, is equal to what?",00:05:46.910,00:05:48.760
"The first entry's going to be
a times k1 plus b times k2.",00:05:48.760,00:05:52.980
"a times k1 plus b times k2, and
the second entry's going",00:05:52.980,00:05:57.695
"to be c times k1 plus
d times k2.",00:05:57.695,00:06:00.270
We have one point left.,00:06:04.660,00:06:07.220
"The transformation, if we take
the transformation of our",00:06:07.220,00:06:10.310
"vector 0, k2, what do we get?",00:06:10.310,00:06:15.730
"We get a times 0 plus b times
k2, which is just b times k2,",00:06:15.730,00:06:22.620
"and then c times 0 plus d times
k2, which is just d",00:06:22.620,00:06:26.900
"times k2, just like that.",00:06:26.900,00:06:29.780
"So let's draw the image of
our rectangle under our",00:06:29.780,00:06:33.260
transformation.,00:06:33.260,00:06:33.735
So let me redraw my axes.,00:06:33.735,00:06:36.760
"So this is my vertical
axis right there.",00:06:36.760,00:06:40.120
"This is my horizontal
axis right there.",00:06:40.120,00:06:43.330
"And so a gets mapped to the
zero vector right there.",00:06:43.330,00:06:48.250
"So this is the transformation
of 0, 0 right like that.",00:06:48.250,00:06:54.440
"Now, what does the vector
b get transformed?",00:06:54.440,00:06:57.400
"The vector b gets transformed
to ak1, ck1, so let me",00:06:57.400,00:07:01.480
draw it like this.,00:07:01.480,00:07:03.230
"The vector b gets transformed
to something that looks like",00:07:03.230,00:07:05.930
"this, where this is the vector--
so this is the",00:07:05.930,00:07:09.130
"transformation of k1 and 0,
which is equal to ak1, ck1.",00:07:09.130,00:07:20.110
We saw that already.,00:07:20.110,00:07:21.400
"Now, what does this yellow
guy get transformed to?",00:07:21.400,00:07:24.240
"Let me do the blue one first.
So the blue one gets",00:07:24.240,00:07:26.490
transformed here.,00:07:26.490,00:07:28.390
Let me finish here.,00:07:28.390,00:07:30.090
"So if we come down here,
this is going to",00:07:30.090,00:07:33.300
be ak1 right there.,00:07:33.300,00:07:35.340
"If we go to the left like that,
that's going to ck1.",00:07:35.340,00:07:39.090
That's how we graph it.,00:07:39.090,00:07:40.450
"Now this last guy, this blue
guy, maybe he looks",00:07:40.450,00:07:43.980
something like this.,00:07:43.980,00:07:46.870
"This is the transformation of
that vector right there by",00:07:49.500,00:07:53.640
"this linear transformation, 0,
k2, which is equal to the",00:07:53.640,00:08:00.930
"vector bk2 and dk2, so this
point right here is bk2 and",00:08:00.930,00:08:10.420
"then this coordinate
right there is dk2.",00:08:10.420,00:08:14.320
"Now this last guy, this yellow
point, when I transformed it,",00:08:14.320,00:08:17.660
what do I get?,00:08:17.660,00:08:18.860
"I get ak1, plus bk2, so ak1 plus
bk2 will get you right",00:08:18.860,00:08:23.700
"about there, so that's going
to be its x-coordinate.",00:08:23.700,00:08:26.620
"And then its y-coordinate
is ck1 plus dk2.",00:08:26.620,00:08:28.630
"So ck1, and then I'm going to
add that much again to it.",00:08:31.810,00:08:37.559
"So it's going to get me
someplace over here.",00:08:37.559,00:08:40.250
"So I'm going to add this
distance to this whole",00:08:40.250,00:08:42.530
"distance over here, so
I'm going to get",00:08:42.530,00:08:44.400
up here some point.,00:08:44.400,00:08:45.670
"I'm going to get right
over here.",00:08:45.670,00:08:48.620
"So that vector's going to look
something like that.",00:08:48.620,00:08:53.180
"That is the transformation
of k1, k2.",00:08:53.180,00:08:58.460
"That's the transformation
of that guy.",00:08:58.460,00:09:00.400
"And then if we connect the
dots, remember, the",00:09:00.400,00:09:02.180
"transformation of this set of
this rectangle, or we could",00:09:02.180,00:09:05.860
"say the image of this
rectangle under the",00:09:05.860,00:09:08.000
"transformation, we just take
each of the points that define",00:09:08.000,00:09:10.890
"that rectangle and then
we connect the dots.",00:09:10.890,00:09:13.310
We saw that awhile ago.,00:09:13.310,00:09:14.950
So let me draw it this way.,00:09:14.950,00:09:19.000
"This line right here that
connects those two dots will",00:09:19.000,00:09:22.840
"be transformed to this line that
connects these two dots",00:09:22.840,00:09:26.240
right there.,00:09:26.240,00:09:27.950
"This line-- I was going to do
that in a different color.",00:09:27.950,00:09:32.170
"This line that connects those
two dots is going to be",00:09:32.170,00:09:34.640
"transformed to this line that
connects those two dots.",00:09:34.640,00:09:38.600
"And then we have this line that
connects those two dots",00:09:38.600,00:09:41.990
"is going to be transformed to
this line that connects these",00:09:41.990,00:09:45.230
two dots right there.,00:09:45.230,00:09:46.740
"And then finally, this line that
connects these two dots",00:09:46.740,00:09:49.610
"is going to be transformed to
this line that connects these",00:09:49.610,00:09:52.090
two dots right there.,00:09:52.090,00:09:53.800
"Now, just out of curiosity,
what is-- let",00:09:53.800,00:09:57.220
me just write this.,00:09:57.220,00:09:58.380
"So this rectangle right
here is the image.",00:09:58.380,00:10:01.510
"We could write this as T of our
rectangle, or if we wanted",00:10:01.510,00:10:06.580
"to write it in words, this is
equal to the image of the",00:10:06.580,00:10:11.220
"rectangle under our
transformation T.",00:10:11.220,00:10:19.670
"Now, what is the area of the
image of our rectangle under",00:10:19.670,00:10:27.880
our transformation?,00:10:27.880,00:10:29.570
"What is the area
of this thing?",00:10:29.570,00:10:31.800
What is this area right there?,00:10:31.800,00:10:35.670
"Well, we could view this
parallelogram essentially as a",00:10:35.670,00:10:39.670
"parallelogram generated by this
vector and that vector.",00:10:39.670,00:10:45.590
"Or if we wanted to write it
another way, if we had a",00:10:45.590,00:10:48.360
"matrix, if we had some matrix
whose column vectors are this",00:10:48.360,00:10:52.950
"guy and that guy, so let's say,
it's first column vector",00:10:52.950,00:10:56.915
"is this guy, so ak1, ck1, And
this one right here, this was",00:10:56.915,00:11:03.140
"the transformation of k1, 0.",00:11:03.140,00:11:07.780
"And then its second column
vector is this guy right here,",00:11:07.780,00:11:12.210
which was bk2 and dk2.,00:11:12.210,00:11:18.810
"This parallelogram is a
parallelogram generated by",00:11:18.810,00:11:24.330
these two column vectors.,00:11:24.330,00:11:25.700
"This was the transformation
right here.",00:11:25.700,00:11:27.610
"This was the transformation
of 0, k2, right?",00:11:27.610,00:11:33.300
"And in the last video, we said
that the area of this",00:11:33.300,00:11:37.670
"parallelogram is equivalent
to-- let me",00:11:37.670,00:11:41.450
write this right now.,00:11:41.450,00:11:42.650
"So the area of the
parallelogram, which is the",00:11:42.650,00:11:44.220
"same thing as the area of the
image of our original",00:11:44.220,00:11:46.970
"rectangle under our
transformation, the area this",00:11:46.970,00:11:49.820
"parallelogram is equivalent to
the absolute value-- let me",00:11:49.820,00:11:54.220
"call this determinant
right here, let me",00:11:54.220,00:11:56.230
call this I for image.,00:11:56.230,00:11:58.580
"So it's equal to the absolute
value of the determinant of",00:11:58.580,00:12:07.420
"the matrix whose column
vectors generate that",00:12:07.420,00:12:11.910
parallelogram.,00:12:11.910,00:12:13.010
"So it should be equal to the
determinant of the absolute",00:12:13.010,00:12:16.800
value of the determinant of I.,00:12:16.800,00:12:18.810
We saw that in the last video.,00:12:18.810,00:12:20.200
"That's what the area of this
thing is going to be.",00:12:20.200,00:12:22.720
"Well, what is the determinant
of this?",00:12:22.720,00:12:27.190
"Well, this is going to be equal
to-- we've got to keep",00:12:27.190,00:12:29.126
our absolute value signs.,00:12:29.126,00:12:30.990
"So the determinant of this is
ak1 times dk2, so we could",00:12:30.990,00:12:35.970
"right this as-- let
me switch colors.",00:12:35.970,00:12:38.480
"We could write it
as k1, k2, ad.",00:12:38.480,00:12:44.840
"All I did is multiply that term
times that term minus",00:12:44.840,00:12:46.910
this term times that term.,00:12:46.910,00:12:48.750
"So minus k1, k2, bc.",00:12:48.750,00:12:51.430
"That's just the definition
of the",00:12:55.280,00:12:56.930
determinant of a 2-by-2 matrix.,00:12:56.930,00:12:59.170
We saw this in the last video.,00:12:59.170,00:13:00.470
"This is nothing new here, or
maybe it might be relatively",00:13:00.470,00:13:03.050
"new if you just watched the last
video, but all I'm saying",00:13:03.050,00:13:05.590
"is, look, if we want to figure
out this parallelogram, this",00:13:05.590,00:13:07.700
"is the parallelogram
generated by that",00:13:07.700,00:13:10.030
vector and that vector.,00:13:10.030,00:13:11.560
"And if we say that those two
guys are the column vectors of",00:13:11.560,00:13:13.840
"some matrix right there, we saw
on the last video that the",00:13:13.840,00:13:17.990
"area of this parallelogram is
equal to the absolute value of",00:13:17.990,00:13:21.140
"the determinant of
this matrix.",00:13:21.140,00:13:23.000
"Now, what is the equal to?",00:13:23.000,00:13:24.710
"This is equal to-- we can
factor out a k1, k2.",00:13:24.710,00:13:26.950
"So it's the absolute value of
k1, k2 times ad minus bc.",00:13:26.950,00:13:37.220
Now what is this equal to?,00:13:37.220,00:13:39.410
"Well, ad minus bc, that is
the determinant of our",00:13:39.410,00:13:45.530
transformation vector.,00:13:45.530,00:13:47.590
"So if we say that T of x-- if we
called that vector-- or our",00:13:47.590,00:13:50.980
transformation matrix.,00:13:50.980,00:13:52.610
"If we call this matrix A, if we
call it A, this is equal to",00:13:52.610,00:13:58.900
"k1, k2 times the determinant
of A, which is a pretty",00:13:58.900,00:14:05.070
interesting takeaway.,00:14:05.070,00:14:06.480
"What this is telling us is,
look, if I have some region,",00:14:06.480,00:14:11.020
"or in this case, I just have the
rectangle, but if I have",00:14:11.020,00:14:13.230
"some region in my domain and I
apply a transformation, and",00:14:13.230,00:14:17.360
"let's say my region
has some area.",00:14:17.360,00:14:19.390
"Let's say in this case,
it has some area A.",00:14:21.960,00:14:24.460
"Let me write this
right as area.",00:14:24.460,00:14:29.480
"This was my original area in
my original region, right?",00:14:29.480,00:14:33.290
"And then I apply some
transformation to it where the",00:14:33.290,00:14:35.760
"transformation is equal to some
matrix A times any member",00:14:35.760,00:14:41.760
of your domain.,00:14:41.760,00:14:43.020
"I apply some transformation
to it.",00:14:43.020,00:14:44.710
I get some new region.,00:14:44.710,00:14:46.520
"I get the image of this set
under my transformation.",00:14:46.520,00:14:51.170
"Your new area is going to be
equal to the absolute value of",00:14:51.170,00:14:57.150
"the determinant of your
transformation matrix.",00:14:57.150,00:15:00.980
"That's the determinant of the
transformation matrix.",00:15:00.980,00:15:03.800
"That's the transformation
matrix.",00:15:03.800,00:15:05.365
"So it's equal to the
determinant of the",00:15:10.520,00:15:12.050
"transformation matrix times
the area of your original",00:15:12.050,00:15:17.730
"rectangle in this case, right?",00:15:17.730,00:15:22.460
"This was your original
rectangle.",00:15:22.460,00:15:23.990
"You take the absolute value,
just because sometimes you",00:15:23.990,00:15:26.500
"swap these vectors you might
get a negative sign, so you",00:15:26.500,00:15:31.540
take the absolute value.,00:15:31.540,00:15:32.500
But that's a really neat idea.,00:15:32.500,00:15:34.510
"The determinant of the
transformation matrix is",00:15:34.510,00:15:38.630
"essentially a scaling
factor on the area",00:15:38.630,00:15:43.020
of a certain region.,00:15:43.020,00:15:44.420
"Now, I'm not going to prove it
to you here, but you can kind",00:15:44.420,00:15:46.600
of imagine it.,00:15:46.600,00:15:49.100
"Let's say I have some-- let
me go abstract now.",00:15:49.100,00:15:52.620
"Let's say I have some region in
R2-- let me do a better--",00:15:52.620,00:15:57.960
"let me do a shape that
you might recognize.",00:15:57.960,00:16:00.600
"Let's say I have something
like that.",00:16:00.600,00:16:05.970
"Let's say it's an
ellipse, right?",00:16:05.970,00:16:07.960
And this is our domain.,00:16:07.960,00:16:09.210
It's R2.,00:16:11.580,00:16:13.530
"And let's say that the area
here, the area of this region",00:16:13.530,00:16:16.750
"right here, is equal to A.",00:16:16.750,00:16:19.570
So area is equal to A.,00:16:19.570,00:16:23.330
"And let's say I have some
transformation T that is a",00:16:23.330,00:16:27.180
"mapping from R2 to R2 And T is
defined, so T applied to some",00:16:27.180,00:16:35.800
"vector x in my domain is equal
to-- well, I already used A,",00:16:35.800,00:16:39.485
"so let's say it's equal to some
matrix B times any vector",00:16:39.485,00:16:45.130
in my domain.,00:16:45.130,00:16:46.430
"If I take the image of this area
under T, so this is my",00:16:46.430,00:16:50.210
domain right here.,00:16:50.210,00:16:51.190
Let me do it in the codomain.,00:16:51.190,00:16:52.300
"Let's say the image of this
under B, let's say it looks",00:16:52.300,00:16:54.850
"something like-- or my image
under T-- let's say it looks",00:16:54.850,00:16:57.860
something like this.,00:16:57.860,00:16:58.940
"I don't know what it's going to
look like, but let's say it",00:16:58.940,00:17:00.550
looks something like this.,00:17:00.550,00:17:01.800
"Let's say it looks something
like that right there, so this",00:17:04.339,00:17:11.060
right here.,00:17:11.060,00:17:12.490
"So if we call this set-- let
me call it E for ellipse.",00:17:12.490,00:17:16.460
"That's this whole thing
right here.",00:17:16.460,00:17:17.839
"This is the ellipse
right there.",00:17:17.839,00:17:20.280
"This is the image of my
ellipse under the",00:17:20.280,00:17:24.140
transformation T.,00:17:24.140,00:17:25.170
"If I take every point of this
ellipse, I'll construct this",00:17:25.170,00:17:27.440
right here.,00:17:27.440,00:17:28.260
"Or I guess maybe just to keep
the analogy straight for this",00:17:28.260,00:17:32.910
"example, let's say that the
ellipse is the set of just the",00:17:32.910,00:17:36.050
"boundary, but it also applies
actually if you were to fill",00:17:36.050,00:17:39.820
up the whole region.,00:17:39.820,00:17:41.090
"So this is boundary gets
mapped to this",00:17:41.090,00:17:46.450
boundary right here.,00:17:46.450,00:17:47.380
"But it would have worked
just as well if we",00:17:47.380,00:17:48.820
filled up the region.,00:17:48.820,00:17:49.640
"Since I'm not proving either to
you very rigorously, you'll",00:17:49.640,00:17:52.900
"have to accept it as
a leap of faith.",00:17:52.900,00:17:54.570
"So this is the image of this
boundary under our",00:17:54.570,00:17:58.650
transformation.,00:17:58.650,00:17:59.800
"And if the area surrounded by
this boundary, or if you could",00:17:59.800,00:18:02.650
"say the area of this region is
A, then the area here, the",00:18:02.650,00:18:07.570
"area of the image of our
ellipse under our",00:18:07.570,00:18:13.790
"transformation is going to be
equal to the absolute value of",00:18:13.790,00:18:17.750
"our area, our original area,
right there times the",00:18:17.750,00:18:22.090
"determinant of our
transformation matrix.",00:18:22.090,00:18:27.565
"If you find it a little bit of
a big leap to go from just an",00:18:31.310,00:18:34.580
"arbitrary rectangle
transformation to maybe these",00:18:34.580,00:18:37.310
"more generalized shapes, you
can imagine-- so T is going",00:18:37.310,00:18:41.090
from there to there.,00:18:41.090,00:18:42.230
"It's always nice to
draw that arrow.",00:18:42.230,00:18:44.300
"But if you view it as a bit of
a leap to make that jump from",00:18:44.300,00:18:48.830
"rectangles to curves, you can
imagine this shape to be able",00:18:48.830,00:18:52.530
"to be constructed by a bunch
of arbitrary rectangles.",00:18:52.530,00:18:58.020
"So you could essentially fill
this space with a bunch of",00:18:58.020,00:19:01.320
"arbitrary rectangles like
this, and you could keep",00:19:01.320,00:19:09.120
"making them infinitely
small so that you",00:19:09.120,00:19:11.970
completely fill the space.,00:19:11.970,00:19:15.000
"You completely fill that
space with rectangles.",00:19:15.000,00:19:16.730
"And if you were to map each of
those rectangles using T, each",00:19:16.730,00:19:20.180
"of those rectangles might look
something like this.",00:19:20.180,00:19:23.560
"Maybe they look something
like this.",00:19:23.560,00:19:25.350
"I don't know what they'll
look like.",00:19:25.350,00:19:27.760
"They'll look like a bunch of
parallelograms. Maybe they'll",00:19:27.760,00:19:32.970
look something like that.,00:19:32.970,00:19:35.620
"I'm not drawing it
that neatly.",00:19:35.620,00:19:37.820
"They'll look like a bunch of
parallelograms, and they will",00:19:37.820,00:19:41.140
"essentially fill this
space right there.",00:19:41.140,00:19:43.040
"So that's a way you can get your
head around the idea of",00:19:43.040,00:19:46.090
"jumping from just the arbitrary
rectangles to these",00:19:46.090,00:19:49.200
"arbitrary curves or
shapes or regions.",00:19:49.200,00:19:51.500
"But this is a pretty neat
outcome, and it's a very",00:19:51.500,00:19:53.310
"interesting way to view
a determinant.",00:19:53.310,00:19:55.850
"A determinant of a
transformation matrix is",00:19:55.850,00:19:58.100
"essentially a scaling factor for
area as you map from one",00:19:58.100,00:20:02.190
"region to another region, or
as we go from one region to",00:20:02.190,00:20:05.560
"the image of that region under
the transformation.",00:20:05.560,00:20:08.590
