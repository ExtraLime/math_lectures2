OK.,00:00:00.590,00:00:00.710
I've got some matrix A.,00:00:00.710,00:00:02.870
It's an n by k matrix.,00:00:02.870,00:00:05.980
"Let's say it's not just
any n by k matrix.",00:00:05.980,00:00:09.320
"This matrix A has a bunch of
columns that are all linearly",00:00:09.320,00:00:13.650
independent.,00:00:13.650,00:00:14.400
"So, a1.",00:00:14.400,00:00:16.320
"a2, all the way through ak
are linearly independent.",00:00:16.320,00:00:23.440
"They are linearly independent
columns.",00:00:23.440,00:00:25.590
Let me write that down.,00:00:25.590,00:00:27.250
"a1, a2, all the column
vectors of A.",00:00:27.250,00:00:31.620
"All the way through ak are
linearly independent.",00:00:31.620,00:00:36.430
"Now, what does that mean?",00:00:36.430,00:00:37.460
"That means that the only
solution to x1 times a1 plus",00:00:37.460,00:00:42.250
"x2 times a2, plus all the
way to xk times ak.",00:00:42.250,00:00:49.820
"The only solution to this is all
of these x's have to be 0.",00:00:49.820,00:00:54.320
"So, all xi's must
be equal to 0.",00:00:54.320,00:00:59.210
"That's what linear independence
implies.",00:00:59.210,00:01:01.740
"Or another way to write it is
all the solutions to this",00:01:01.740,00:01:05.060
"equation x1, x2, all
the way down to xk",00:01:05.060,00:01:12.350
equaling the zero vector.,00:01:12.350,00:01:14.090
"That all the solutions to this
are all of these entries have",00:01:14.090,00:01:17.410
to be equal to 0.,00:01:17.410,00:01:18.260
"This is just another way of
writing this right there.",00:01:18.260,00:01:21.730
We've seen it multiple times.,00:01:21.730,00:01:22.970
"That's the zero vector
right there.",00:01:22.970,00:01:25.260
"So if all of these have to be 0,
that's like saying that the",00:01:25.260,00:01:28.850
"only solution to ax is equal
to 0, is x is equal to the",00:01:28.850,00:01:40.310
zero vector.,00:01:40.310,00:01:41.320
"Or another way to say it-- this
is all coming out of the",00:01:41.320,00:01:44.420
"fact that this guy's columns
are linearly independent.",00:01:44.420,00:01:48.090
"So linear independence
of columns.",00:01:48.090,00:01:50.430
"Based on that, we can say, since
the only solution to ax",00:01:52.950,00:01:55.870
"is equal to 0 is x is equal to
the zero vector, we know that",00:01:55.870,00:01:58.630
"the null space of a must be
equal to the zero vector.",00:01:58.630,00:02:03.220
"Or it's a set with the just
the zero vector in it.",00:02:03.220,00:02:05.900
"And that is all a
bit of review.",00:02:05.900,00:02:08.280
"Now, n by k.",00:02:08.280,00:02:09.280
We don't know its dimensions.,00:02:09.280,00:02:10.350
"It may or may not be
a square matrix.",00:02:10.350,00:02:12.600
"So we don't know, necessarily,
whether it's invertible and",00:02:12.600,00:02:14.970
all of that.,00:02:14.970,00:02:16.010
"But maybe we can construct an
invertible matrix with it.",00:02:16.010,00:02:20.410
"So, let's study a transpose
times a.",00:02:20.410,00:02:24.530
a transpose times a.,00:02:24.530,00:02:27.716
A is an n by k matrix.,00:02:27.716,00:02:30.610
"A transpose will be
a k by n matrix.",00:02:30.610,00:02:34.030
"So, A transpose a is going
to be a k by k matrix.",00:02:34.030,00:02:38.710
So it's a square matrix.,00:02:38.710,00:02:40.090
"So that's a nice place
to start for",00:02:40.090,00:02:44.260
an invertible matrix.,00:02:44.260,00:02:45.280
"So let's see if it is
actually invertible.",00:02:45.280,00:02:47.410
"We don't know anything
about A.",00:02:47.410,00:02:48.590
"All we know is its columns
are linearly independent.",00:02:48.590,00:02:51.380
"Let's see if A transpose
a is invertible.",00:02:51.380,00:02:53.760
"Essentially, to show that it's
invertible, if we can show",00:02:59.160,00:03:01.980
"that all of its columns are
linearly independent, then",00:03:01.980,00:03:05.110
we'll know it's invertible.,00:03:05.110,00:03:06.220
"If we have any-- and I'll
get back to this at",00:03:06.220,00:03:09.020
the end of the video.,00:03:09.020,00:03:09.710
"But if you have a square
matrix with linearly",00:03:09.710,00:03:20.400
"independent columns-- remember,
the linearly",00:03:20.400,00:03:24.670
"independent columns all are
associated with pivot columns",00:03:24.670,00:03:30.030
"when you put them in reduced
row echelon form.",00:03:30.030,00:03:32.740
"So if you have a square matrix,
then you're going to",00:03:32.740,00:03:34.660
"have exactly-- so if it's a k by
k matrix, that means you're",00:03:34.660,00:03:38.070
"going to have k-- that means
that the reduced row echelon",00:03:38.070,00:03:41.960
"form of a matrix will have k
pivot columns and be k by k.",00:03:41.960,00:03:56.590
And be a square k by k matrix.,00:03:56.590,00:03:58.740
"And there's only one k by k
matrix with k pivot columns.",00:03:58.740,00:04:02.540
"And that's the identity
matrix.",00:04:02.540,00:04:03.985
The k by k identity matrix.,00:04:06.660,00:04:09.240
"And if when you do something
to reduce row echelon form,",00:04:09.240,00:04:12.460
"and it you got the identity
matrix, that means that your",00:04:12.460,00:04:15.260
matrix is invertible.,00:04:15.260,00:04:16.510
"I could have probably left that
to the end of the video,",00:04:21.019,00:04:22.810
but I just want to show you.,00:04:22.810,00:04:23.420
"If we can show that-- we already
know that this guy's",00:04:23.420,00:04:26.610
"square, that a transpose
A is a square matrix.",00:04:26.610,00:04:29.670
"If we can show that, given
that a has linearly",00:04:29.670,00:04:32.780
"independent columns, that a
transpose times A also has",00:04:32.780,00:04:37.110
"linearly independent columns,
and given the columns are",00:04:37.110,00:04:40.170
"linearly independent, and it's a
square matrix, that tells us",00:04:40.170,00:04:42.330
"that when we put it into reduced
row echelon form,",00:04:42.330,00:04:44.390
we'll get the identity matrix.,00:04:44.390,00:04:45.920
"And that tells us that this
thing would be invertible.",00:04:45.920,00:04:48.580
"Let's see if we can prove that
all of this guy's columns are",00:04:48.580,00:04:53.150
linearly independent.,00:04:53.150,00:04:54.950
"So let's say I have
some vector V.",00:04:54.950,00:04:58.910
"Let's say my vector V is a
member of the null space of a",00:04:58.910,00:05:06.050
transpose A.,00:05:06.050,00:05:07.850
"That means that if I take a
transpose A times my vector v,",00:05:07.850,00:05:15.230
"I'm going to get the
zero vector.",00:05:15.230,00:05:18.060
Fair enough?,00:05:18.060,00:05:19.040
"Now, what happens if I multiply
both sides of the",00:05:19.040,00:05:21.770
"equation times the transpose
of this guy?",00:05:21.770,00:05:25.220
"So I'll get a v transpose--
actually let me just do it",00:05:25.220,00:05:27.870
right here.,00:05:27.870,00:05:28.990
"I multiply v transpose
on this side, and v",00:05:28.990,00:05:32.560
transpose on this side.,00:05:32.560,00:05:35.250
"You could view this as a
matrix vector product.",00:05:35.250,00:05:39.290
Right?,00:05:39.290,00:05:39.810
"Or, in general, if you take a
row vector times a column",00:05:39.810,00:05:45.990
"vector, it's essentially
their dot product.",00:05:45.990,00:05:48.380
"So this right-hand side of the
equation, you dot anything",00:05:48.380,00:05:50.610
with the zero vector.,00:05:50.610,00:05:51.860
"That is just going to
be the zero vector.",00:05:54.300,00:05:57.000
"Now what is the left-hand side
of this going to be?",00:05:57.000,00:05:59.870
We've seen this before.,00:05:59.870,00:06:01.960
"If you have the transpose of--
we can view this as, even",00:06:01.960,00:06:06.330
"though it's a transpose of a
vector, you can view it as a--",00:06:06.330,00:06:09.180
"it is a row factor,
but you could also",00:06:09.180,00:06:10.520
view it as a matrix.,00:06:10.520,00:06:12.730
Right?,00:06:12.730,00:06:15.220
"Let's say v is a
k by 1 matrix.",00:06:15.220,00:06:20.650
"v transpose will be
a 1 by k matrix.",00:06:20.650,00:06:23.450
We've seen this before.,00:06:23.450,00:06:24.510
"That that is equal to the
reverse product, the transpose",00:06:24.510,00:06:30.120
of the reverse product.,00:06:30.120,00:06:31.250
"Or if we take the product of two
things and transpose it,",00:06:31.250,00:06:34.340
"that's the same thing as taking
the reverse product of",00:06:34.340,00:06:38.240
"the transposes of either
of those two matrices.",00:06:38.240,00:06:41.160
"So given that, we can replace
this right here with a times a",00:06:41.160,00:06:46.530
"vector v transpose-- and we're
multiplying this vector times",00:06:46.530,00:06:55.140
"av times this vector
right here.",00:06:55.140,00:06:58.290
"And that is going to be equal
to the zero vector.",00:06:58.290,00:07:02.070
"Now, what is this?",00:07:02.070,00:07:04.160
"If I'm taking some vector's
transpose, and let's say this",00:07:04.160,00:07:08.370
is a vector.,00:07:08.370,00:07:09.020
"Remember, even though I have a
matrix vector product right",00:07:09.020,00:07:11.760
"here, when I multiply a matrix
times this vector, it will",00:07:11.760,00:07:15.750
result in another vector.,00:07:15.750,00:07:17.260
"So this is a vector, and this
is a vector right here.",00:07:17.260,00:07:19.840
"And if I take some vector and I
multiply its transpose times",00:07:19.840,00:07:24.090
"that vector-- we've
seen this before.",00:07:24.090,00:07:26.120
"That is the same thing
as y dot y.",00:07:26.120,00:07:29.970
"These two statements
are identical.",00:07:29.970,00:07:32.070
"So this thing right here is the
same thing as av dot av.",00:07:32.070,00:07:41.770
"And so what does the right-hand
side equal?",00:07:47.940,00:07:50.050
"The right-hand side is going
to be equal to 0.",00:07:50.050,00:07:52.920
"Actually let me just make
a correction up here.",00:07:52.920,00:07:54.950
"When I take v transpose times
the zero vector, v transpose",00:07:54.950,00:07:59.550
is going to have k elements.,00:07:59.550,00:08:01.300
"And then the zero vector is also
going to have k elements.",00:08:01.300,00:08:03.730
"And when I take this product
that's like dotting it.",00:08:03.730,00:08:06.370
"You're taking the dot
product of v and 0.",00:08:06.370,00:08:08.540
"So this is a dot product of v
with the zero vector which is",00:08:08.540,00:08:11.990
"equal to zero, the
scalar zero.",00:08:11.990,00:08:14.340
"So this right here's
the scalar zero.",00:08:14.340,00:08:16.170
"I want to make sure
I clarify that.",00:08:16.170,00:08:17.690
"It wouldn't make sense
otherwise.",00:08:17.690,00:08:19.470
"So the right-hand side, when I
multiply the zero vector times",00:08:19.470,00:08:22.340
"the transpose of v, gets
just the number zero.",00:08:22.340,00:08:25.710
No vector zero there.,00:08:25.710,00:08:27.620
"So this av dot av is going
to be equal to 0.",00:08:27.620,00:08:31.230
"Or we could say that the
magnitude, or the length, of",00:08:31.230,00:08:38.490
av squared is equal to 0.,00:08:38.490,00:08:40.450
"Or that tells us that av
has to be equal to 0.",00:08:40.450,00:08:43.400
"The only vector whose length
is 0, is the zero vector.",00:08:43.400,00:08:47.740
So av-- let me switch colors.,00:08:47.740,00:08:49.660
"Using that a little
bit too much.",00:08:49.660,00:08:52.240
"So we know that av
must be equal to",00:08:52.240,00:08:57.640
"0, to the zero vector.",00:08:57.640,00:09:01.080
"This must be equal to the zero
vector since its length is 0.",00:09:01.080,00:09:05.590
"Now, we started off with saying
v is a member of the",00:09:05.590,00:09:08.310
null space of a transpose A.,00:09:08.310,00:09:12.340
"v can be any member of the null
space of a transpose A.",00:09:12.340,00:09:18.050
"But then from that assumption,
it turns out that V also has",00:09:18.050,00:09:22.650
"to be a member of the
null space of A.",00:09:22.650,00:09:25.760
That av is equal to 0.,00:09:25.760,00:09:28.140
Let's write that down.,00:09:28.140,00:09:30.270
"If v is a member of the null
space of a transpose A, then v",00:09:30.270,00:09:39.220
"is a member of the
null space of a.",00:09:39.220,00:09:42.420
"Now, our null space of A,
because A's columns are",00:09:42.420,00:09:45.230
"linearly independent, it only
contains one vector.",00:09:45.230,00:09:48.590
"It only contains the
zero vector.",00:09:48.590,00:09:51.300
"So, if this guy's a member of
the null space of A transpose",00:09:51.300,00:09:55.110
"A, and he has to be a member
of the null space of A,",00:09:55.110,00:09:57.750
"there's only one thing
he can be.",00:09:57.750,00:09:58.940
There's only one entry there.,00:09:58.940,00:10:00.730
"So then v has to be equal
to the zero vector.",00:10:00.730,00:10:06.670
"Or another way to say that is,
any v that's in our null space",00:10:06.670,00:10:10.760
"of a transpose A has to
be the zero vector.",00:10:10.760,00:10:13.820
"Or the null space of a transpose
A is equal to the",00:10:13.820,00:10:19.150
"null space of a which is equal
to just the zero factor",00:10:19.150,00:10:23.850
sitting there.,00:10:23.850,00:10:24.760
"Now, what does that do for us?",00:10:24.760,00:10:26.910
"That tells us that the only
solution to a transpose A",00:10:26.910,00:10:35.530
"times some vector x equal to
zero, this says that the only",00:10:35.530,00:10:39.640
"solution is the zero vector is
equal to the zero vector.",00:10:39.640,00:10:52.400
Right?,00:10:52.400,00:10:52.700
"Because the null space of a
transpose A is the same as the",00:10:52.700,00:10:55.650
null space of a.,00:10:55.650,00:10:56.560
"And that just has the
zero vector in it.",00:10:56.560,00:10:58.160
"The null space is just
the solution to this.",00:10:58.160,00:11:00.920
"So if the only solution to the
null space is this, that means",00:11:00.920,00:11:05.190
"that the columns of a transpose
A are linearly",00:11:05.190,00:11:14.570
independent.,00:11:14.570,00:11:15.600
"You could, essentially, write
all of the linear combinations",00:11:15.600,00:11:19.350
"of the columns by the weights
of the entries of x.",00:11:19.350,00:11:21.810
"We actually did that
at the beginning.",00:11:21.810,00:11:23.830
"It's the same argument
we used up here.",00:11:23.830,00:11:27.400
"So if all of their columns are
linearly independent, and I",00:11:27.400,00:11:30.270
"said it over here, a transpose
A has linearly independent",00:11:30.270,00:11:33.530
"columns, and it's a square
matrix, that was from the",00:11:33.530,00:11:39.700
definition of it.,00:11:39.700,00:11:41.160
"So we now know that A transpose
A if I were to put",00:11:41.160,00:11:46.400
it-- let me do this way.,00:11:46.400,00:11:48.600
"That tells me that the reduced
row echelon form of a",00:11:48.600,00:11:51.640
"transpose A is going to be equal
to the k by k identity",00:11:51.640,00:11:57.370
"matrix which tells me that a
transpose A is invertible.",00:11:57.370,00:12:01.930
Which is a pretty neat result.,00:12:04.590,00:12:05.900
"I started with the
matrix that has",00:12:05.900,00:12:08.490
linearly independent columns.,00:12:08.490,00:12:09.910
So it wasn't just any matrix.,00:12:09.910,00:12:12.240
"It wasn't just any run
of the mill matrix.",00:12:12.240,00:12:14.390
"It did have linearly independent
columns, but it",00:12:14.390,00:12:16.680
might have weird dimensions.,00:12:16.680,00:12:17.870
"It's not necessarily
a square matrix.",00:12:17.870,00:12:20.510
"But I could construct
a square matrix.",00:12:20.510,00:12:22.420
a transpose A with it.,00:12:22.420,00:12:24.320
"And we now know that
it also has",00:12:24.320,00:12:26.550
linearly independent columns.,00:12:26.550,00:12:27.890
It's a square matrix.,00:12:27.890,00:12:29.410
And therefore it is invertible.,00:12:29.410,00:12:31.700
