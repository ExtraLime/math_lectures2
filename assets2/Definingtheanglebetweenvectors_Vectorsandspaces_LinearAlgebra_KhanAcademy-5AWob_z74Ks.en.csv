"A couple of videos ago we
introduced the idea of the",00:00:00.950,00:00:05.350
length of a vector.,00:00:05.350,00:00:07.240
That equals the length.,00:00:07.240,00:00:09.210
"And this was a neat idea because
we're used to the",00:00:09.210,00:00:12.560
"length of things in two- or
three-dimensional space, but",00:00:12.560,00:00:15.720
"it becomes very abstract when
we get to n dimensions.",00:00:15.720,00:00:18.730
"If this has a hundred
components, at least for me,",00:00:18.730,00:00:21.250
"it's hard to visualize a hundred
dimension vector.",00:00:21.250,00:00:24.210
"But we've actually defined
it's notion of length.",00:00:24.210,00:00:26.410
"And we saw that this is actually
a scalar value.",00:00:26.410,00:00:30.900
It's just a number.,00:00:30.900,00:00:32.270
"In this video, I want to attempt
to define the notion",00:00:32.270,00:00:36.530
of an angle between vectors.,00:00:36.530,00:00:40.125
"As you can see, we're building
up this mathematics of vectors",00:00:45.400,00:00:48.880
"from the ground up, and we can't
just say, oh, I know",00:00:48.880,00:00:51.495
"what an angle is because
everything we know about",00:00:51.495,00:00:53.590
"angles and even lengths, it
just applies to what we",00:00:53.590,00:00:56.410
"associate with two- or
three-dimensional space.",00:00:56.410,00:00:58.650
"But the whole study of linear
algebra is abstracting these",00:00:58.650,00:01:02.230
"ideas into multi-dimensional
space.",00:01:02.230,00:01:05.010
"And I haven't even defined what
dimension is yet, but I",00:01:05.010,00:01:07.240
"think you understand that idea
to some degree already.",00:01:07.240,00:01:11.030
"When people talk about one or
two or three dimensions.",00:01:11.030,00:01:14.020
"So let's say that I have some
vector-- let's say I have two",00:01:14.020,00:01:18.020
"vectors, vectors a and b.",00:01:18.020,00:01:20.530
"They're nonzero and they're
members of Rn.",00:01:23.940,00:01:26.460
"And I don't have a notion of
the angle between them yet,",00:01:30.800,00:01:36.790
but let me just draw them out.,00:01:36.790,00:01:38.430
"Let me just draw them as if
I could draw them in two",00:01:38.430,00:01:40.390
dimensions.,00:01:40.390,00:01:40.870
"So that would be vector
a right there.",00:01:40.870,00:01:44.960
"Maybe that's vector
b right there.",00:01:44.960,00:01:48.400
"And then this vector right
there would be the",00:01:48.400,00:01:50.980
vector a minus b.,00:01:50.980,00:01:53.810
"And you can verify that just the
way we've learned to add",00:01:53.810,00:01:57.050
and subtract vectors.,00:01:57.050,00:01:58.200
"Or you know, this is
heads to tails.",00:01:58.200,00:02:00.310
"So b plus a minus b is of
course, going to be vector a.",00:02:00.310,00:02:03.840
"And that all just
works out there.",00:02:03.840,00:02:06.490
"To help us define this notion
of angle, let me construct",00:02:06.490,00:02:09.050
"another triangle that's going
to look a lot like this one.",00:02:09.050,00:02:12.345
"But remember, I'm just doing
this for our simple minds to",00:02:12.345,00:02:17.470
imagine it in two dimensions.,00:02:17.470,00:02:19.140
"But these aren't necessarily
two-dimensional beasts.",00:02:19.140,00:02:23.030
"These each could have a
hundred components.",00:02:23.030,00:02:25.000
"But let me make another
triangle.",00:02:25.000,00:02:26.555
"Well, it should look similar.",00:02:30.150,00:02:33.440
Say it looks like that.,00:02:33.440,00:02:35.000
"And I'm going to define the
sides of the triangles to be",00:02:35.000,00:02:38.040
"the lengths of each
of these vectors.",00:02:38.040,00:02:40.090
"Remember, the lengths of each of
these vectors, I don't care",00:02:40.090,00:02:42.250
"how many components there
are, they're just",00:02:42.250,00:02:43.460
going to be your numbers.,00:02:43.460,00:02:44.680
"So the length of this side right
here is just going to be",00:02:44.680,00:02:46.980
the length of a.,00:02:46.980,00:02:48.530
"The length of this side right
here is just going to be the",00:02:48.530,00:02:50.580
"length of vector a
minus vector b.",00:02:50.580,00:02:54.695
"And the length of this side
right here is going to be the",00:02:57.610,00:02:59.780
length of vector b.,00:02:59.780,00:03:02.010
"Now the first thing we want to
make sure is that we can",00:03:02.010,00:03:03.990
"always construct a triangle
like that.",00:03:03.990,00:03:07.500
"And so under what circumstances
could we not",00:03:07.500,00:03:09.940
"construct a triangle
like this?",00:03:09.940,00:03:11.280
"Well we wouldn't be able
construct a triangle like this",00:03:11.280,00:03:13.550
if this side.,00:03:13.550,00:03:15.820
"if b, if the magnitude-- so
let me write this down.",00:03:15.820,00:03:19.410
"It's kind of a subtle
point, but I want to",00:03:19.410,00:03:20.710
make this very clear.,00:03:20.710,00:03:22.520
"In order to define an angle, I
want to be comfortable that I",00:03:22.520,00:03:24.810
"can always make this
construction.",00:03:24.810,00:03:27.300
"And I need to make sure that--
let me write reasons why I",00:03:27.300,00:03:30.680
"couldn't make this
construction.",00:03:30.680,00:03:39.490
"Well what if the magnitude of
b was greater than, or the",00:03:39.490,00:03:45.310
"length of vector b was greater
than the length of vector a",00:03:45.310,00:03:49.450
"plus the length of
vector a minus b?",00:03:49.450,00:03:54.760
"In two dimensions, I could never
draw a triangle like",00:03:54.760,00:03:57.260
"that then because you would
have this length plus this",00:03:57.260,00:03:59.950
"length would be shorter than
this thing right here.",00:03:59.950,00:04:02.680
"So you could never
construct it.",00:04:02.680,00:04:04.010
"And I could do with
all the sides.",00:04:04.010,00:04:05.200
"What if this length was larger
than one of these two sides?",00:04:05.200,00:04:08.470
"Or what if that length
was larger than one",00:04:08.470,00:04:10.080
of those two sides?,00:04:10.080,00:04:10.760
"I could just never draw
a two-dimensional",00:04:10.760,00:04:14.300
triangle that way.,00:04:14.300,00:04:15.560
"So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use the triangle--",00:04:15.560,00:04:17.800
"the vector triangle inequality
to prove that each of these",00:04:17.800,00:04:21.544
"sides is less than or equal to
the sum of the other sides.",00:04:21.544,00:04:27.560
I could do the same thing.,00:04:27.560,00:04:28.540
Let me make the point clear.,00:04:28.540,00:04:29.620
"I could show that if a, for
whatever reason, was greater",00:04:29.620,00:04:33.500
"than the other sides plus b,
then I wouldn't be able to",00:04:33.500,00:04:39.190
create a triangle.,00:04:39.190,00:04:39.990
"And the last one of course is
if a minus b, for whatever",00:04:39.990,00:04:44.020
"reason, was greater than the
other two sides, I just",00:04:44.020,00:04:46.200
"wouldn't be able to draw
a triangle in a plus b.",00:04:46.200,00:04:49.310
"So I need to show that for any
vectors, any real vectors--",00:04:49.310,00:04:53.590
"nonzero, real vectors that are
members of Rn-- that none of",00:04:53.590,00:04:56.770
these can ever happen.,00:04:56.770,00:04:58.180
"I need to prove that none
of those can happen.",00:04:58.180,00:04:59.970
"So what does the triangle
inequality tell us?",00:04:59.970,00:05:02.580
"The triangle inequality tells
us that if I have the sum of",00:05:02.580,00:05:06.680
"two vectors, if I take the
length of the sum of two",00:05:06.680,00:05:12.250
"vectors, that that is always
going to be less than-- and",00:05:12.250,00:05:18.400
these are nonzero vectors.,00:05:18.400,00:05:19.360
"This is always going to be less
than or equal to the sum",00:05:19.360,00:05:22.710
"of each of their individual
lengths.",00:05:22.710,00:05:24.510
"So let's see if we can
apply that to this",00:05:28.220,00:05:31.020
triangle right here.,00:05:31.020,00:05:32.930
"So what is the magnitude,
the length of a?",00:05:32.930,00:05:41.250
Well I can rewrite vector a.,00:05:41.250,00:05:42.780
What is vector a equal to?,00:05:42.780,00:05:44.110
"Vector a is equal to vector
b plus vector a minus b.",00:05:44.110,00:05:53.380
"I mean I'm just rewriting
the vector here.",00:05:53.380,00:05:55.450
"I'm just rewriting a here as a
sum of the other two vectors.",00:05:55.450,00:05:59.970
Nothing fancy there.,00:05:59.970,00:06:00.910
"I haven't used the triangle
inequality or anything.",00:06:00.910,00:06:02.790
"I've just used my definition
of vector addition.",00:06:02.790,00:06:06.060
"But here now, if I put little
parentheses here, now I can",00:06:06.060,00:06:09.630
apply the triangle inequality.,00:06:09.630,00:06:10.820
"And I say, well,
you know what?",00:06:10.820,00:06:11.760
"This is going to be, by the
triangle inequality, which",00:06:11.760,00:06:14.440
"we've proved, it's going to be
less than or equal to the",00:06:14.440,00:06:18.180
"lengths of each of
these vectors.",00:06:18.180,00:06:20.740
"Vector b plus the length
of vector a minus b.",00:06:20.740,00:06:27.410
"So we know that the length of a
is less than the sum of that",00:06:27.410,00:06:31.400
one and that one.,00:06:31.400,00:06:32.560
"So we don't have to worry about
this being our problem.",00:06:32.560,00:06:35.980
We know that that is not true.,00:06:35.980,00:06:38.270
Now let's look at b.,00:06:38.270,00:06:42.610
"So is there any way that I can
rewrite b as a sum of two",00:06:42.610,00:06:46.040
other vectors?,00:06:46.040,00:06:46.790
Well sure.,00:06:46.790,00:06:47.650
"I can write it as a sum of a
plus, let me put it this way.",00:06:47.650,00:06:55.800
"If that vector right there is a
minus b, the same vector in",00:06:55.800,00:06:59.610
"the reverse direction is going
to be the vector b minus a.",00:06:59.610,00:07:03.720
"So a plus the vector
b minus a.",00:07:03.720,00:07:10.770
That's the same thing as b.,00:07:10.770,00:07:11.890
And you can see it right here.,00:07:11.890,00:07:13.290
"The a's would cancel
out and you're just",00:07:13.290,00:07:14.580
left with the b there.,00:07:14.580,00:07:15.990
"Now by the triangle inequality,
we know that this",00:07:15.990,00:07:19.710
"is less than or equal to the
length of vector a plus the",00:07:19.710,00:07:25.960
length of vector b minus a.,00:07:25.960,00:07:29.350
"Now you're saying hey, Sal,
you're dealing with b minus a.",00:07:29.350,00:07:31.930
"This is the length
of a minus b.",00:07:31.930,00:07:34.200
"And I can leave this for you
to prove it based on our",00:07:34.200,00:07:36.630
"definition of vector lengths,
but the length of b minus a is",00:07:36.630,00:07:45.400
"equal to minus 1 times
a minus b.",00:07:45.400,00:07:50.830
"And I'll leave it to you
to say that look,",00:07:50.830,00:07:54.050
these lengths are equal.,00:07:54.050,00:07:57.250
"Because essentially-- I could
leave that, but I think you",00:07:57.250,00:08:00.780
"can take that based on just the
visual depiction of them",00:08:00.780,00:08:05.030
"that they're the exact same
vectors, just in different",00:08:05.030,00:08:07.510
directions.,00:08:07.510,00:08:07.930
"And I have to be careful with
length because it's not just",00:08:07.930,00:08:09.850
in two dimensions.,00:08:09.850,00:08:10.780
"But I think you get the idea and
I'll leave that for you to",00:08:10.780,00:08:14.290
"prove that these lengths
are the same thing.",00:08:14.290,00:08:16.450
"So we know that b is less
than the length",00:08:16.450,00:08:18.850
of those two things.,00:08:18.850,00:08:20.270
"So we don't have to worry about
that one right there.",00:08:20.270,00:08:25.000
"Finally, a minus b.",00:08:25.000,00:08:28.595
"The magnitude or the length
of vector a minus b.",00:08:28.595,00:08:35.919
"Well I can write that as the
length of-- or I can write",00:08:35.919,00:08:41.940
"that as vector a plus
vector minus b.",00:08:41.940,00:08:46.140
"If we just put a minus b right
there and go in the other",00:08:49.920,00:08:52.610
"directions, we could say minus
b, which would be in that",00:08:52.610,00:08:55.560
"direction plus a would give
us our vector a minus b.",00:08:55.560,00:09:01.550
"Actually, I don't even
have to go there.",00:09:01.550,00:09:02.680
That's obvious from this.,00:09:02.680,00:09:03.650
"I just kind of put the negative
in the parentheses.",00:09:03.650,00:09:06.040
"Well the triangle inequality,
and this might seem a little",00:09:06.040,00:09:08.260
"mundane to you, but it really
shows us that we can always",00:09:08.260,00:09:11.050
"define a regular planar triangle
based on these",00:09:11.050,00:09:13.970
vectors in this way.,00:09:13.970,00:09:15.430
"It tells us this is less than or
equal to the length of our",00:09:15.430,00:09:19.070
"vector a plus the length
of minus b.",00:09:19.070,00:09:24.150
"And I just said and you could
prove it to yourself, that",00:09:24.150,00:09:26.680
"this is the same thing
as the length of b.",00:09:26.680,00:09:29.660
"So we just saw that
this is definitely",00:09:29.660,00:09:32.130
less than those two.,00:09:32.130,00:09:32.870
"This is definitely less
than those two.",00:09:32.870,00:09:34.480
"And that is definitely
less than those two.",00:09:34.480,00:09:37.290
"None of the reasons that would
keep us from constructing a",00:09:37.290,00:09:40.130
triangle are valid.,00:09:40.130,00:09:41.080
"So we can always construct a
triangle in this way from any",00:09:41.080,00:09:44.710
"arbitrary nonzero
vectors in Rn.",00:09:44.710,00:09:48.340
We can always construct this.,00:09:48.340,00:09:50.260
"Now, to define an angle, let
me redraw it down here.",00:09:50.260,00:09:57.390
"Let me redraw the vectors, maybe
a little bit bigger.",00:09:57.390,00:10:00.820
That's vector a.,00:10:00.820,00:10:03.920
This is vector b.,00:10:03.920,00:10:05.390
"And then let me just
draw it this way.",00:10:05.390,00:10:07.680
"This is the vector
right there.",00:10:07.680,00:10:09.300
That is the vector a minus b.,00:10:09.300,00:10:12.170
"And we said we're going to
define a corresponding",00:10:12.170,00:10:14.360
"regular, run of the mill,
vanilla triangle whose lengths",00:10:14.360,00:10:18.910
"are defined by the lengths
of the vectors,",00:10:18.910,00:10:22.600
by the vector lengths.,00:10:22.600,00:10:23.710
"So this is the length
of b, that side.",00:10:23.710,00:10:26.900
"This is the length
of a minus b.",00:10:26.900,00:10:31.340
"And then this is the
length of a.",00:10:31.340,00:10:33.890
"Now that I know that I can
always construct a triangle",00:10:33.890,00:10:37.370
"like this, I can attempt to
define-- or actually, I will",00:10:37.370,00:10:41.080

I'm trying to define.",00:10:55.430,00:10:59.120
"This is what I'm going
to define.",00:10:59.120,00:11:01.900
"These can have arbitrary number
of components, so it's",00:11:01.900,00:11:03.860
hard to visualize.,00:11:03.860,00:11:04.720

angle as the corresponding",00:11:04.720,00:11:09.500
"angle in a regular, run of the
mill triangle where the sides",00:11:09.500,00:11:13.900
"of the run of the mill triangle
are the two vectors",00:11:13.900,00:11:16.460

"of the difference between
the two vectors.",00:11:19.420,00:11:21.720

between all of",00:11:45.560,00:11:48.300
these things right here?,00:11:48.300,00:11:50.230
Well sure.,00:11:50.230,00:11:50.780
"If you remember from your
trigonometry class, and if you",00:11:50.780,00:11:53.910
"don't, I've proved it
in the playlist. You",00:11:53.910,00:11:56.810
have the law of cosines.,00:11:56.810,00:11:58.060
"And I'll do it with an arbitrary

"just because I don't want
to confuse you.",00:12:04.860,00:12:06.320
"So if this is side a, b, and c
and this is theta, the law of",00:12:06.320,00:12:12.040

of a broader Pythagorean",00:12:23.080,00:12:26.220

It accounts for all angles.,00:12:30.460,00:12:31.640

"you're just left with the
Pythagorean theorem.",00:12:34.100,00:12:36.130
But we've proven this.,00:12:36.130,00:12:37.050
"This applies to just regular,
run of the mill triangles.",00:12:37.050,00:12:41.200
"And lucky for us, we have a
regular, run of the mill",00:12:41.200,00:12:44.870
triangle here.,00:12:44.870,00:12:46.080
"So let's apply the law
of cosines to this",00:12:46.080,00:12:48.580
triangle right here.,00:12:48.580,00:12:51.650
"And the way I drew it,
they correspond.",00:12:51.650,00:12:53.950
"The length of this
side squared.",00:12:53.950,00:12:56.900

"Length of vector a minus vector
b, that's just the",00:13:03.420,00:13:06.290
length of that side.,00:13:06.290,00:13:07.160
"So I'm just squaring
that side.",00:13:07.160,00:13:10.490
"It equals the length of vector
b squared plus the length of",00:13:10.490,00:13:16.790
"vector a squared minus 2 times
the length of-- I'll just",00:13:16.790,00:13:23.150
"write two times length of vector
a times the length of",00:13:23.150,00:13:27.150

of that angle.",00:13:31.360,00:13:32.940

between these two vectors to",00:13:32.940,00:13:35.650
"be the same as this
angle right there.",00:13:35.650,00:13:37.630
"So if we know this angle, by
definition, we know that angle",00:13:37.630,00:13:40.790
right there.,00:13:40.790,00:13:41.970
"Well, we know that the square
of our lengths of a vector",00:13:41.970,00:13:45.210
"when we use our factor
definition of length, that",00:13:45.210,00:13:47.525
"this is just the same thing as
a vector dotted with itself.",00:13:47.525,00:13:50.960
"So that's a minus
b dot a minus b.",00:13:50.960,00:13:58.080
"It's all going to be equal to
this whole stuff on the",00:13:58.080,00:14:00.530
right-hand side.,00:14:00.530,00:14:01.370
"But let me simplify
the left-hand",00:14:01.370,00:14:02.780
side of this equation.,00:14:02.780,00:14:04.230
"a minus b dot a minus b, this is
the same thing as a dot a--",00:14:04.230,00:14:10.350
"those two terms--
minus a dot b.",00:14:10.350,00:14:15.180
And then I have minus b dot a.,00:14:18.065,00:14:20.650
Those two terms right there.,00:14:24.680,00:14:26.390
"And then you have the
minus b dot minus b.",00:14:26.390,00:14:29.010
"That's the same thing
as a plus b dot b.",00:14:29.010,00:14:32.530
"Remember, this is just a
simplification of the",00:14:32.530,00:14:34.260
left-hand side.,00:14:34.260,00:14:35.640
And I can rewrite this.,00:14:35.640,00:14:36.850
"a dot a, we know that's just
the length of a squared.",00:14:36.850,00:14:42.010
"a dot b and b dot a are
the same thing, so",00:14:42.010,00:14:44.210
we have two of these.,00:14:44.210,00:14:45.460
"So this right here, this term
right there will simplify to",00:14:45.460,00:14:51.400
minus 2 times a dot b.,00:14:51.400,00:14:57.370
"And then finally, b dot b.",00:14:57.370,00:15:00.090
"We know that that's just the
length of b squared.",00:15:00.090,00:15:03.120
"I just simplified or maybe I
just expanded-- that's a",00:15:03.120,00:15:05.700
better word.,00:15:05.700,00:15:06.650
"When you go from one term here
to three terms, you can't say",00:15:06.650,00:15:09.680
you simplified it.,00:15:09.680,00:15:10.680
"But I expanded just the
left-hand side and so this has",00:15:10.680,00:15:13.400
"to be equal to the right-hand
side by the law of cosines.",00:15:13.400,00:15:16.520
"So that is equal to-- I almost
feel like instead of rewriting",00:15:16.520,00:15:21.570
"it, let me just copy
and paste it.",00:15:21.570,00:15:23.130
What did I just do?,00:15:28.280,00:15:29.490
"Copy, edit.",00:15:29.490,00:15:33.240
Copy and paste.,00:15:33.240,00:15:35.620
There you go.,00:15:35.620,00:15:36.810
"I don't know it that
was worth it.",00:15:36.810,00:15:37.870
"But maybe I saved a little
bit of time.",00:15:37.870,00:15:40.350
"So that is equal to
that right there.",00:15:40.350,00:15:44.810
And then we can simplify.,00:15:44.810,00:15:46.170
"We have a length of a
squared here, length",00:15:46.170,00:15:48.610
of a squared there.,00:15:48.610,00:15:49.590
Subtract it from both sides.,00:15:49.590,00:15:51.040
"The length of b squared here,
length of b squared there.",00:15:51.040,00:15:54.270
Subtract it from both sides.,00:15:54.270,00:15:56.120
"And then, what can we do?",00:15:56.120,00:16:00.000
"We can divide both sides by
minus 2 because everything",00:16:00.000,00:16:02.770
else has disappeared.,00:16:02.770,00:16:04.100
"And so that term and that term
will both become 1's.",00:16:04.100,00:16:08.960
"And all we're left with is the
vector a dot the vector b.",00:16:08.960,00:16:16.470
"And this is interesting because
all of a sudden we're",00:16:16.470,00:16:18.490
"getting a relationship
between the dot",00:16:18.490,00:16:19.860
products of two vectors.,00:16:19.860,00:16:21.200
"We've kind of gone away from
their definition by lengths.",00:16:21.200,00:16:24.460
"But the dot product of two
vectors is equal to the",00:16:24.460,00:16:29.740
"product of their lengths,
their vector lengths.",00:16:29.740,00:16:36.550
"And they can have an arbitrary
number of components.",00:16:36.550,00:16:39.110
"Times the cosine of the
angle between them.",00:16:39.110,00:16:43.450
"Remember, this theta, I said
this is the same as when you",00:16:43.450,00:16:46.300
"draw this kind of analogous,
regular triangle.",00:16:46.300,00:16:48.490
"But I'm defining the angle
between them to",00:16:48.490,00:16:50.530
be the same as that.,00:16:50.530,00:16:52.230
"So I can say that this is
the angle between them.",00:16:52.230,00:16:56.610
"And obviously, the idea of
between two vectors, it's hard",00:16:56.610,00:17:00.290
"to visualize if you go beyond
three dimensions.",00:17:00.290,00:17:02.110
"But now we have it at least,
mathematically defined.",00:17:02.110,00:17:04.289
"So if you give me two vectors we
can now, using this formula",00:17:07.099,00:17:11.310
"that we've proved using this
definition up here, we can now",00:17:11.310,00:17:14.920
"calculate the angle between
any two vectors using this",00:17:14.920,00:17:19.410
right here.,00:17:19.410,00:17:20.510
"And just to make it clear, what
happens if a is a-- and",00:17:20.510,00:17:28.319
"maybe it's not clear from that
definition, so I'll make it",00:17:28.319,00:17:30.270
"clearer here that by definition,
if a is equal to",00:17:30.270,00:17:36.020
"some scalar multiple of b where
c is greater than 0,",00:17:36.020,00:17:40.660
"we'll define theta
to be equal to 0.",00:17:40.660,00:17:46.190
"And if c is less than 0, so a is
collinear, but goes in the",00:17:46.190,00:17:50.000
"exact opposite direction, we'll
define theta to be equal",00:17:50.000,00:17:53.330
to 180 degrees.,00:17:53.330,00:17:55.440
"And that's consistent with what
we understand about just",00:17:55.440,00:17:58.080
two-dimensional vectors.,00:17:58.080,00:18:00.620
"If they're collinear and
kind of the scalar",00:18:00.620,00:18:03.220
multiples the same.,00:18:03.220,00:18:03.790
"That means a looks something
like that and b looks",00:18:03.790,00:18:07.460
something like that.,00:18:07.460,00:18:08.940
"So we say oh, that's
a 0 angle.",00:18:08.940,00:18:10.810
"And if they go the other way,
if a looks something like--",00:18:10.810,00:18:15.010
"this is the case where a is
just going in the other",00:18:15.010,00:18:16.870
direction from b.,00:18:16.870,00:18:18.130
"a goes like that and b goes like
that, we define the angle",00:18:18.130,00:18:21.540
"between them to be
180 degrees.",00:18:21.540,00:18:24.310
"But everything else is pretty
well defined by",00:18:24.310,00:18:26.690
the triangle example.,00:18:26.690,00:18:27.750
"I had to make the special case
of these because it's not",00:18:27.750,00:18:29.880
"clear you really get a triangle
in these cases",00:18:29.880,00:18:32.620
"because the triangle
kind of disappears.",00:18:32.620,00:18:34.870
"It flattens out if a and b are
on top of each other or if",00:18:34.870,00:18:38.320
"they're going in the exact
opposite direction.",00:18:38.320,00:18:39.940
"So that's why I wanted to make
a little bit of a side note",00:18:39.940,00:18:45.150
right there.,00:18:45.150,00:18:47.080
"Now, using this definition of
the angle between the vectors,",00:18:47.080,00:18:53.130
"we can now define the idea
of perpendicular vectors.",00:18:53.130,00:18:57.440
"So we can now say perpendicular
vectors-- this",00:18:57.440,00:18:59.660
"is another definition-- and
this won't be earth",00:18:59.660,00:19:06.100
"shattering, but it kind of is
because we've generalized this",00:19:06.100,00:19:09.220
"to vectors that have an
arbitrary number of",00:19:09.220,00:19:11.570
components.,00:19:11.570,00:19:12.000
"We're defining perpendicular
to mean the theta between--",00:19:12.000,00:19:16.590
"two vectors a and b are
perpendicular if the angle",00:19:16.590,00:19:22.890
between them is 90 degrees.,00:19:22.890,00:19:29.520
And we can define that.,00:19:29.520,00:19:30.550
"We can take two vectors,
dot them.",00:19:30.550,00:19:34.880
Take their dot product.,00:19:34.880,00:19:36.110
"Figure out their two lengths and
then you could figure out",00:19:36.110,00:19:38.660
the angle between them.,00:19:38.660,00:19:39.760
And if it's 90 degrees.,00:19:39.760,00:19:41.080
"you can say that they are
perpendicular angles.",00:19:41.080,00:19:45.460
"And I want to be very clear here
that this is actually not",00:19:45.460,00:19:47.880
"defined for the 0 vector
right here.",00:19:47.880,00:19:50.640
"So this situation right here,
not defined for the 0 vector.",00:19:50.640,00:19:57.240
"Because if you have the 0
vector, then this quantity",00:19:57.240,00:19:59.660
"right here is going to be 0 and
then this quantity right",00:19:59.660,00:20:02.760
here is going to be 0.,00:20:02.760,00:20:03.810
"And there's no clear definition
for your angle.",00:20:03.810,00:20:06.600
"If this is 0 right here, you
did 0 is equal to 0 times",00:20:06.600,00:20:11.300
cosine of theta.,00:20:11.300,00:20:12.940
"And so if you wanted to solve
for theta you'd get cosine of",00:20:12.940,00:20:15.610
"theta is equal to 0/0,
which is undefined.",00:20:15.610,00:20:19.810
"But what we can do is create a
slightly more general word",00:20:24.540,00:20:29.200
than the word perpendicular.,00:20:29.200,00:20:31.300
"So you have to have a defined
angle to even talk about",00:20:31.300,00:20:35.530
perpendicular.,00:20:35.530,00:20:36.400
"If the angle between two vectors
is 90 degrees, we're",00:20:36.400,00:20:39.010
"saying by definition, those two
vectors are perpendicular.",00:20:39.010,00:20:43.170

statement and we can-- if you",00:20:43.170,00:20:46.360
"look at them, if the angle
between two vectors is 90",00:20:46.360,00:20:48.460

"So let's say that theta
is 90 degrees.",00:20:51.190,00:20:53.180

is 90 degrees.",00:20:56.370,00:20:58.060
Theta is equal to 90 degrees.,00:20:58.060,00:21:00.420

tell us?",00:21:00.420,00:21:02.260

equal to the length of a times",00:21:02.260,00:21:07.960

of 90 degrees.",00:21:07.960,00:21:12.450
What's cosine of 90 degrees?,00:21:12.450,00:21:14.180
It's 0.,00:21:14.180,00:21:15.220

whole term is going to be",00:21:18.850,00:21:21.070
equal to 0.,00:21:21.070,00:21:22.370
"So if theta is equal to
90 degrees, then a dot",00:21:22.370,00:21:27.400
b is equal to 0.,00:21:27.400,00:21:31.220
"And so this is another
interesting takeaway.",00:21:31.220,00:21:36.320
"If a and b are perpendicular,
then their dot product is",00:21:36.320,00:21:45.690
going to be equal to 0.,00:21:45.690,00:21:49.020
"Now if their dot product is
equal to 0, can we necessarily",00:21:49.020,00:21:52.330
"say that they are
perpendicular?",00:21:52.330,00:21:54.470
"Well what if a or b
is the 0 vector?",00:21:54.470,00:21:59.120
"The 0 vector-- let me call
it z for 0 vector.",00:21:59.120,00:22:02.820
Or I could just draw.,00:22:02.820,00:22:04.070
"The 0 vector dot anything is
always going to be equal to 0.",00:22:06.350,00:22:10.590
"So does that mean that the 0
vector is perpendicular to",00:22:10.590,00:22:12.970
everything?,00:22:12.970,00:22:13.670
Well no.,00:22:13.670,00:22:14.570
"Because the 0 vector I said, we
have to have the notion of",00:22:14.570,00:22:19.320
"an angle between things in
order to use the word",00:22:19.320,00:22:21.550
perpendicular.,00:22:21.550,00:22:22.170
So we can't use the 0 vector.,00:22:22.170,00:22:25.340
"We can't say just because two
vectors dot products are equal",00:22:25.340,00:22:28.280
"to 0 that they are
perpendicular.",00:22:28.280,00:22:30.200
"And that's because the 0 vector
would mess that up",00:22:30.200,00:22:32.460
"because the 0 vector
is not defined.",00:22:32.460,00:22:34.500
"But if we say, and we have been
saying, that a and b are",00:22:34.500,00:22:38.810
"nonzero, if they are nonzero
vectors, then we can say that",00:22:38.810,00:22:47.660
"if a and b are nonzero and their
dot product is equal to",00:22:47.660,00:22:50.350
"0, then a and b are
perpendicular.",00:22:50.350,00:22:52.370
So now it goes both ways.,00:22:52.370,00:22:54.190
"But what if we just have this
condition right here?",00:22:54.190,00:22:56.960
"What if we just have the
condition that a dot b is",00:22:56.960,00:23:00.440
equal to 0?,00:23:00.440,00:23:01.200
"It seems like that's kind of
just a simple, pure condition.",00:23:01.200,00:23:05.040
"And we can write a
word for that.",00:23:05.040,00:23:06.740
"And these words are often used
synonymously, but hopefully",00:23:06.740,00:23:08.790
"you understand the
distinction now.",00:23:08.790,00:23:10.480
"We can say that if two vectors
dot product is equal to 0, we",00:23:10.480,00:23:17.110
will call them orthogonal.,00:23:17.110,00:23:18.930
"As I always say, spelling
isn't my best subject.",00:23:25.580,00:23:29.250
"But this is kind
of a neat idea.",00:23:29.250,00:23:30.880
"This tells us that-- well, that
all perpendicular vectors",00:23:30.880,00:23:36.010
are orthogonal.,00:23:36.010,00:23:37.690
"And it also tells us that the
0 vector is orthogonal to",00:23:37.690,00:23:50.780
everything else.,00:23:50.780,00:23:52.460
"To everything, even to itself.",00:23:52.460,00:23:55.570
"The 0 dot 0 vector
you still get 0.",00:23:55.570,00:23:57.860
"So by definition,
it's orthogonal.",00:23:57.860,00:23:59.820
"So for the first time probably
in your mathematical career,",00:23:59.820,00:24:03.080
"you're seeing that the words--
you know, every time you first",00:24:03.080,00:24:06.110
"got exposed to the words
perpendicular and orthogonal",00:24:06.110,00:24:08.220
"in geometry or maybe in physics
or wherever else, they",00:24:08.220,00:24:10.950
"were always kind of
the same words.",00:24:10.950,00:24:13.200
"But now I'm introducing a nice,
little distinction here",00:24:13.200,00:24:16.230
and you can kind of be a little,00:24:16.230,00:24:17.880
smart aleck with teachers.,00:24:17.880,00:24:19.610
"Oh, you know, it's perpendicular
only is the",00:24:19.610,00:24:22.040
"vectors aren't-- if neither
of them are 0 vector.",00:24:22.040,00:24:24.810
"Otherwise, if their dot product
is 0, you can only say",00:24:24.810,00:24:27.290
that they're orthogonal.,00:24:27.290,00:24:28.250
"But if they're nonzero you
could say that they're",00:24:28.250,00:24:29.730
orthogonal and perpendicular.,00:24:29.730,00:24:31.105
"But anyway, I thought that I
would introduce this little",00:24:31.105,00:24:33.280
"distinction for you in case you
have someone that likes to",00:24:33.280,00:24:35.455
trip you up with words.,00:24:35.455,00:24:37.050
"But it also I think highlights
that we are building a",00:24:37.050,00:24:39.900
"mathematics from the ground up
and we have to be careful",00:24:39.900,00:24:42.310
about the words we use.,00:24:42.310,00:24:43.270
"And we have to be very precise
about our definitions.",00:24:43.270,00:24:46.040
"Because if we're not precise
about our definitions and we",00:24:46.040,00:24:47.770
"build up a bunch of mathematics
on top of this and",00:24:47.770,00:24:50.200
"do a bunch of proofs, one day we
might scratch our heads and",00:24:50.200,00:24:53.260
"read some type of
weird ambiguity.",00:24:53.260,00:24:55.040
"And it might have all came out
of the fact that we weren't",00:24:55.040,00:24:57.660
"precise enough in defining what
some of these terms mean.",00:24:57.660,00:25:01.110
"Well anyway, hopefully you
found this useful.",00:25:01.110,00:25:03.470
"We can now take the angle or we
can now determine the angle",00:25:03.470,00:25:06.650
"between vectors with an
arbitrary number of",00:25:06.650,00:25:09.340
components.,00:25:09.340,00:25:10.590
