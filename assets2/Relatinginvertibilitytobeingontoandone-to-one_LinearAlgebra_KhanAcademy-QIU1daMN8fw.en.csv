"A couple of videos ago, we
learned that a function that",00:00:00.770,00:00:03.660
"is a mapping from the set x to
the set y is invertible if and",00:00:03.660,00:00:13.550
"only if-- and I'll write that as
a if with two f's --if and",00:00:13.550,00:00:19.070
"only if for every y-- so
let me write this down.",00:00:19.070,00:00:24.160
I'll do this in yellow.,00:00:24.160,00:00:26.480
"For every y that is a member of
our co-domain, there exists",00:00:26.480,00:00:35.610
"a unique-- and I'll make that a
little bit bold --a unique x",00:00:35.610,00:00:46.260
"that is a member of our domain,
such that f of this x",00:00:46.260,00:00:56.730
is equal to this y.,00:00:56.730,00:00:58.580
"So that's just saying that if
I take my domain right here,",00:00:58.580,00:01:03.320
"that's x, and then I take a
co-domain here, that is y, we",00:01:03.320,00:01:09.410
"say that the function
f is invertible.",00:01:09.410,00:01:11.290
"And we know what invertibility
means.",00:01:15.280,00:01:16.740
"It means that there's this
other function called the",00:01:16.740,00:01:19.337
"inverse that can essentially,
if you take that in",00:01:19.337,00:01:22.410
"composition with f, it's like
taking the identity on x.",00:01:22.410,00:01:25.145
"Or if you take f in composition
with it, it's like",00:01:25.145,00:01:27.360
taking the identity on y.,00:01:27.360,00:01:28.850
"And we've done that multiple
times so I",00:01:28.850,00:01:30.130
won't repeat that there.,00:01:30.130,00:01:31.330
"We know what invertibility
means, but we learned that",00:01:31.330,00:01:34.360
"it's invertible, if and only if,
for every y here, so you",00:01:34.360,00:01:38.290
"take any y here, any y that's
a member of your co-domain,",00:01:38.290,00:01:42.320
"there exists a unique x,
such that f of x is",00:01:42.320,00:01:45.740
equal to that y.,00:01:45.740,00:01:46.990
Let me write it this way.,00:01:49.270,00:01:51.908
"If this is an x, let's say
that's an x not, f of x not",00:01:51.908,00:01:56.370
would be equal to y.,00:01:56.370,00:01:58.020
"So this y would be equal
to f of x not.",00:01:58.020,00:02:01.390
You apply the function here.,00:02:01.390,00:02:02.450
"It's going to map it
to this point here.",00:02:02.450,00:02:04.860
"It wouldn't be invertible
if you had this.",00:02:04.860,00:02:07.670
"If you had two members
of x mapping here.",00:02:07.670,00:02:11.870
"That would break invertibility
if you had this situation,",00:02:11.870,00:02:15.400
"because then you wouldn't have
the unique condition.",00:02:15.400,00:02:18.270
"You have to have a unique x
that maps to this thing.",00:02:18.270,00:02:20.980
"And what I just drew here, this
other pink mapping, we",00:02:20.980,00:02:24.050
"don't have a unique x that maps
to y, we have two x's",00:02:24.050,00:02:27.750
that map to y.,00:02:27.750,00:02:29.040
"Now, based on what I just told
you on that last video, what",00:02:29.040,00:02:31.960
does this mean?,00:02:31.960,00:02:33.342
"If we have a unique x
that maps to each y?",00:02:33.342,00:02:37.110
"That means that we have to have
a one-to-one mapping.",00:02:37.110,00:02:39.910
That f has to be one-to-one.,00:02:39.910,00:02:42.200
Let me write that.,00:02:42.200,00:02:43.820
"Another way of saying
this, is that f is",00:02:43.820,00:02:48.470
"one-to-one, or injective.",00:02:48.470,00:02:52.220
"If we have two guys mapping to
the same y, that would break",00:02:55.500,00:02:59.210
down this condition.,00:02:59.210,00:03:00.030
"We wouldn't be one-to-one and
we couldn't say that there",00:03:00.030,00:03:02.170
"exists a unique x solution to
this equation right here.",00:03:02.170,00:03:09.440
"Now, the other part of this is
that for every y -- you could",00:03:09.440,00:03:13.290
"pick any y here and there
exists a unique x",00:03:13.290,00:03:17.560
that maps to that.,00:03:17.560,00:03:19.840
There cannot be some y here.,00:03:19.840,00:03:21.540
"Let's say that there's some y
here, and no one maps to that.",00:03:21.540,00:03:24.640
"If that's the case, then we
don't have our conditions for",00:03:28.580,00:03:33.810
invertibility.,00:03:33.810,00:03:35.070
"So that would be
not invertible.",00:03:35.070,00:03:39.380
"Everything in y, every element
of y, has to be mapped to.",00:03:39.380,00:03:43.550
"All of these guys have
to be mapped to.",00:03:43.550,00:03:45.510
"And they can only be mapped to
by one of the elements of x.",00:03:45.510,00:03:49.110
"Everything here has to be mapped
to by a unique guy.",00:03:49.110,00:03:52.940
"Now, in the last video, what did
we call it went a function",00:03:52.940,00:03:56.100
"maps to every element
of your co-domain?",00:03:56.100,00:04:00.350
"So this every here, what is
another way of saying that?",00:04:00.350,00:04:03.940
"That a function maps to every
element of your co-domain?",00:04:03.940,00:04:07.220
"On the last video I explained
that notion is called a",00:04:07.220,00:04:09.940
surjective or onto function.,00:04:09.940,00:04:19.730
"So the whole reason why I'm
doing this video is because I",00:04:19.730,00:04:22.150
"really just want to restate
this condition for",00:04:22.150,00:04:25.360
"invertibility using the
vocabulary that I introduced",00:04:25.360,00:04:30.280
to you in the last video.,00:04:30.280,00:04:32.020
"So given that the statement for
every y that's a member of",00:04:32.020,00:04:36.800
"our co-domain, there exists
a x that maps to it.",00:04:36.800,00:04:40.370
"We could just say that
f is surjective.",00:04:40.370,00:04:42.220
"If we just say that f is
surjective, that means that",00:04:49.510,00:04:51.450
everything here is mapped to.,00:04:51.450,00:04:53.070
"But it could be mapped to, maybe
this person right here,",00:04:53.070,00:04:56.440
"could be mapped to
by more than one.",00:04:56.440,00:04:58.090
"Surjective doesn't, by itself,
make the condition that",00:04:58.090,00:05:02.150
"there's a unique mapping
from a member of x to",00:05:02.150,00:05:04.830
that element of y.,00:05:04.830,00:05:05.895
"So in order to get that, in
order to satisfy the unique",00:05:05.895,00:05:09.130
"condition of this condition for
invertibility, we have to",00:05:09.130,00:05:12.200
say that f is also injective.,00:05:12.200,00:05:15.665
"And obviously, maybe the less
formal terms for either of",00:05:19.500,00:05:22.130
"these, you call this onto,
and you could call this",00:05:22.130,00:05:25.950
one-to-one.,00:05:25.950,00:05:28.700
"So using the terminology that we
learned in the last video,",00:05:28.700,00:05:31.280
"we can restate this condition
for invertibility.",00:05:31.280,00:05:34.340
"We can say that a function that
is a mapping from the",00:05:34.340,00:05:38.290
"domain x to the co-domain y is
invertible, if and only if --",00:05:38.290,00:05:48.820
"I'll write it out -- f is both
surjective and injective.",00:05:48.820,00:06:03.320
"Or we could have said, that f is
invertible, if and only if,",00:06:06.230,00:06:09.530
f is onto and one-to-one.,00:06:09.530,00:06:18.200
"And these are really just fancy
ways of saying for every",00:06:18.200,00:06:21.110
"y in our co-domain, there's a
unique x that f maps to it.",00:06:21.110,00:06:26.290
"There isn't more than one and
every y does get mapped to.",00:06:26.290,00:06:30.850
