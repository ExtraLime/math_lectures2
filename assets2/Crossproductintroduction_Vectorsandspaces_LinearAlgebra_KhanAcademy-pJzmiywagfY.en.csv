"We've learned a good bit
about the dot product.",00:00:00.700,00:00:05.050
"But when I first introduced it,
I mentioned that this was",00:00:05.050,00:00:07.110
"only one type of vector
multiplication, and the other",00:00:07.110,00:00:10.730
"type is the cross product, which
you're probably familiar",00:00:10.730,00:00:14.150
"with from your vector calculus
course or from",00:00:14.150,00:00:16.840
your physics course.,00:00:16.840,00:00:18.090
"But the cross product is
actually much more limited",00:00:21.120,00:00:24.030
than the dot product.,00:00:24.030,00:00:24.940
"It's useful, but it's
much more limited.",00:00:24.940,00:00:27.280
"The dot product is defined
in any dimension.",00:00:27.280,00:00:32.970
"So this is defined for any two
vectors that are in Rn.",00:00:32.970,00:00:39.810
"You could take the dot product
of vectors that have two",00:00:39.810,00:00:42.160
components.,00:00:42.160,00:00:42.650
"You could take the dot product
of vectors that have a million",00:00:42.650,00:00:45.020
components.,00:00:45.020,00:00:45.840
"The cross product is
only defined in R3.",00:00:45.840,00:00:55.430
"And the other, I guess, major
difference is the dot produc,",00:00:55.430,00:00:58.960
"and we're going to see this in a
second when I define the dot",00:00:58.960,00:01:01.350
"product for you, I haven't
defined it yet.",00:01:01.350,00:01:03.370
"The dot product results
in a scalar.",00:01:03.370,00:01:06.140
"You take the dot product
of two vectors,",00:01:06.140,00:01:07.850
you just get a number.,00:01:07.850,00:01:09.240
"But in the cross product you're
going to see that we're",00:01:09.240,00:01:10.960
going to get another vector.,00:01:10.960,00:01:13.130
"And the vector we're going to
get is actually going to be a",00:01:13.130,00:01:15.185
"vector that's orthogonal to
the two vectors that we're",00:01:15.185,00:01:17.570
taking the cross product of.,00:01:17.570,00:01:19.230
"So now that I have you excited
with anticipation, let me",00:01:19.230,00:01:23.580
define it for you.,00:01:23.580,00:01:24.370
"And you probably already have
seen this once or twice in",00:01:24.370,00:01:27.300
your mathematical careers.,00:01:27.300,00:01:28.960
Let's say I have the vector a.,00:01:28.960,00:01:32.200
"It has to be in R3, so
it only has three",00:01:32.200,00:01:33.680
"components: a1, a2 and a3.",00:01:33.680,00:01:37.510
"And I'm going to cross that with
the vector b and it has",00:01:37.510,00:01:41.050
"three components:
b1, b2 and b3.",00:01:41.050,00:01:46.910
"a cross b is defined
as a third vector.",00:01:46.910,00:01:54.650
"And now this is going to seem a
little bit bizarre and hard",00:01:54.650,00:01:57.360
"to essentially memorize because
this is a definition.",00:01:57.360,00:02:00.500
"But I'll show you how I think
about it when I have my",00:02:00.500,00:02:03.120
"vectors written in
this column form.",00:02:03.120,00:02:05.220
"If you watch the physics
playlist, I have a bunch of",00:02:05.220,00:02:07.960
"videos on the cross product
and I show you how I think",00:02:07.960,00:02:11.400
"about the cross product when I
have it in the i, j, k form.",00:02:11.400,00:02:15.070
"But when I have it like this,
the way you think about this",00:02:15.070,00:02:17.620
"first term up here, this is
going to be another three",00:02:17.620,00:02:20.880
"vector or another vector in R3,
so it's going to have 1,",00:02:20.880,00:02:23.550
"2, 3 terms.",00:02:23.550,00:02:25.320
"For the first term, what you do
is you ignore these top two",00:02:25.320,00:02:28.570
"terms of this vector and then
you look at the bottom two and",00:02:28.570,00:02:32.330
"you say, a2 times b3
minus a3 times b2.",00:02:32.330,00:02:37.670
"And I've made a few videos on
determinants, although I",00:02:40.800,00:02:42.790
"haven't formally done them in
kind of this linear algebra",00:02:42.790,00:02:45.500
playlist yet.,00:02:45.500,00:02:46.490
"But if you remember kind of
co-factor-- finding out the",00:02:46.490,00:02:49.260
"co-factor terms for when
you're determining the",00:02:49.260,00:02:52.410
"determinant or if you're just
taking the determinant for a",00:02:52.410,00:02:54.780
"2x2 matrix, this might
seem very familiar.",00:02:54.780,00:02:57.260
"So this first term right here is
essentially the determinant",00:02:57.260,00:03:00.740
"of-- if you get rid of this
first row out of both of these",00:03:00.740,00:03:05.770
"guys right here, you take a2
times b3 minus a3 times b2.",00:03:05.770,00:03:11.370
"So it's a2 times b3
minus a3 times b2.",00:03:11.370,00:03:19.890
"That was hopefully pretty
straightforward.",00:03:19.890,00:03:22.110
"Now, not to make your life any
more complicated, when you do",00:03:22.110,00:03:25.600
"the second, when you do the
middle row, when you do this",00:03:25.600,00:03:28.100
"one right here, so you
cross that out.",00:03:28.100,00:03:30.150
"And you might want to do a1
times b3 minus a3 times b1.",00:03:30.150,00:03:36.150
"And that would be natural
because that's",00:03:36.150,00:03:37.380
what we did up there.,00:03:37.380,00:03:38.380
"But the middle row you
do the opposite.",00:03:38.380,00:03:41.800
"You do a3 times b1 minus
a1 times b3.",00:03:41.800,00:03:46.310
"Or you can kind of view it as
the negative of what you would",00:03:46.310,00:03:48.890
have done naturally.,00:03:48.890,00:03:50.180
"So you would have done
a1 b3 minus a3 b1.",00:03:50.180,00:03:54.310
"Now we're going to do
a3 b1 minus a1 b3.",00:03:54.310,00:04:02.490
"And that was only for
that middle row.",00:04:06.140,00:04:07.640
"And then, for the bottom
row, we cross that out",00:04:07.640,00:04:11.120
again or ignore it.,00:04:11.120,00:04:12.300
"And we do a1 times b2, just like
we do with the first row.",00:04:12.300,00:04:15.490
Times a2 b1.,00:04:19.000,00:04:20.980
Or minus a2 b1.,00:04:20.980,00:04:24.930
"This seems all hard to-- and
it is hard to remember.",00:04:24.930,00:04:27.920
"That's why I kind of have to get
that system in place like",00:04:27.920,00:04:30.280
I just talked to you about.,00:04:30.280,00:04:31.130
"But this might seem pretty
bizarre and hairy.",00:04:31.130,00:04:33.650
"So let me do a couple of
examples with you, just so you",00:04:33.650,00:04:35.870
"get the hang of our definition
of the dot product in R3.",00:04:35.870,00:04:40.390
"So let's say that I have the
vector-- let's say I'm",00:04:40.390,00:04:44.200
crossing the vector.,00:04:44.200,00:04:46.950
"I have the vector 1,
minus 7, and 1.",00:04:46.950,00:04:50.730
"And I'm going to cross that
with the vector 5, 2, 4.",00:04:50.730,00:04:58.180
"So this is going to be equal
to a third vector.",00:04:58.180,00:05:00.475
"Let me get some space to
do my mathematics.",00:05:03.810,00:05:06.920
"So for the first element in
this vector, the first",00:05:06.920,00:05:10.170
"component, we just ignore the
first components of these",00:05:10.170,00:05:12.950
"vectors and we say minus 7
times 4 minus 1 times 2.",00:05:12.950,00:05:20.610
"And these are just regular
multiplication.",00:05:23.180,00:05:24.680
"I'm not taking the
dot product.",00:05:24.680,00:05:25.830
"These are just regular
numbers.",00:05:25.830,00:05:27.570
"Then for the middle term, we
ignore the middle terms here",00:05:27.570,00:05:31.050
and then we do the opposite.,00:05:31.050,00:05:32.660
"We do 1 times 5 minus
1 times 4.",00:05:32.660,00:05:39.270
"Remember, you might have been
tempted to do 1 times 4 minus",00:05:42.120,00:05:45.410
"1 times 5 because that's how we
essentially did it in the",00:05:45.410,00:05:48.380
first term.,00:05:48.380,00:05:48.900
"But the middle term
is the opposite.",00:05:48.900,00:05:51.240
"And then finally, the third
term you ignore the third",00:05:51.240,00:05:54.290
"terms here and then you do it
just like the first term.",00:05:54.290,00:05:56.030
You start in the top left.,00:05:56.030,00:05:57.260
1 times 2 minus 7.,00:05:57.260,00:06:04.340
Put that in parentheses.,00:06:04.340,00:06:06.240
Minus minus 7 times 5.,00:06:06.240,00:06:09.500
"And so that is equal
to-- let me see.",00:06:09.500,00:06:15.070
What do we get?,00:06:15.070,00:06:16.500
Minus 7 times 4.,00:06:16.500,00:06:18.580
"I don't want to make a careless
mistake here.",00:06:18.580,00:06:19.890
That's minus 28.,00:06:19.890,00:06:22.960
Minus 2.,00:06:22.960,00:06:25.880
"So this is minus 30 for
that first term.",00:06:25.880,00:06:29.490
This one is 5 minus 4.,00:06:29.490,00:06:31.540
5 minus 4 is just 1.,00:06:36.500,00:06:38.530
And then 2 minus minus 35.,00:06:38.530,00:06:43.430
So 2 minus minus 35.,00:06:43.430,00:06:45.680
That's 2 plus 35.,00:06:45.680,00:06:47.690
That's 37.,00:06:47.690,00:06:49.370
So there you go.,00:06:49.370,00:06:50.220
"Hopefully you understand at
least the mechanics of the",00:06:50.220,00:06:52.280
cross product.,00:06:52.280,00:06:53.400
"So the next thing you're
saying well, OK.",00:06:53.400,00:06:54.950
"I can find the cross product
of two things.",00:06:54.950,00:06:58.000
But what is this good for?,00:06:58.000,00:06:59.790
What does this do for me?,00:06:59.790,00:07:01.400
"And the answer is, is that this
third vector right here,",00:07:01.400,00:07:04.580
"and depending on whether I stay
in the abstract case or",00:07:04.580,00:07:07.170
"whether this case with numbers,
this is orthogonal to",00:07:07.170,00:07:10.600
"the two vectors that we took
the cross product of.",00:07:10.600,00:07:13.680
"So this vector right here is
orthogonal to a and b.",00:07:13.680,00:07:21.920
Which is pretty neat.,00:07:25.810,00:07:27.330
"If you just go think about the
last video when we were",00:07:27.330,00:07:29.210
"talking about normal vectors
to a plane, we can define a",00:07:29.210,00:07:33.250
"vector by-- we can define
a plane by two vectors.",00:07:33.250,00:07:36.080
"If we define a plane-- let's say
that I have vector a right",00:07:36.080,00:07:40.130
"there, and then I
have vector b.",00:07:40.130,00:07:45.020
Let me do vector b like this.,00:07:45.020,00:07:49.680
Those define a plane in R3.,00:07:49.680,00:07:52.650
Let me define your plane.,00:07:52.650,00:07:54.510
"So all the linear combinations
of those two guys, that's a",00:07:54.510,00:07:57.530
plane in R3.,00:07:57.530,00:08:00.010
"You can kind of view it
as they might form",00:08:00.010,00:08:02.370
a subspace in R3.,00:08:02.370,00:08:03.940
That forms a plane.,00:08:03.940,00:08:05.630
"If you take a cross b, you
get a third vector that's",00:08:05.630,00:08:09.070
orthogonal to those two.,00:08:09.070,00:08:12.840
"And so a cross b will
pop out like this.",00:08:12.840,00:08:16.070
"It'll be orthogonal to both of
them and look like that.",00:08:16.070,00:08:19.310
"And so this vector right
there is a cross b.",00:08:19.310,00:08:22.940
"And you might say, Sal, how did
you know-- I mean, there's",00:08:22.940,00:08:25.500
"multiple vectors that
are orthogonal.",00:08:25.500,00:08:27.070
"Obviously, the length of the
vector, and I didn't specify",00:08:27.070,00:08:29.960
"that there, but it could pop
straight up like that or why",00:08:29.960,00:08:32.900
"didn't it-- you know, you just
as easily could have popped",00:08:32.900,00:08:34.630
straight down like that.,00:08:34.630,00:08:35.610
"That also would be orthogonal
to a and b.",00:08:35.610,00:08:38.130
"And the way that a cross b is
defined, you can essentially",00:08:38.130,00:08:42.190
"figure out the direction
visually by using what's",00:08:42.190,00:08:44.930
called the right hand rule.,00:08:44.930,00:08:46.390
"And the way I think about it
is you take your right hand",00:08:46.390,00:08:51.880
"and let me see if I can draw
a suitable right hand.",00:08:51.880,00:08:55.290
"Point your index finger
in the direction of a.",00:08:55.290,00:08:58.320
"So if your index finger is in
the direction of a and then I",00:08:58.320,00:09:01.910
"point my middle finger in
the direction of b.",00:09:01.910,00:09:04.340
"So my middle finger, in this
case, is going to go",00:09:04.340,00:09:06.150
something like that.,00:09:06.150,00:09:07.370
"My middle finger is going to
do something like that.",00:09:07.370,00:09:09.250
"And then my other fingers
do nothing.",00:09:09.250,00:09:11.560
"Then my thumb will go in the
direction of a cross b.",00:09:11.560,00:09:18.780
You could see that there.,00:09:18.780,00:09:19.710
"My thumb is in the direction
of a cross b.",00:09:19.710,00:09:24.750
"And assuming that you are
anatomically similar to me,",00:09:24.750,00:09:28.890
"then you still get
the same result.",00:09:28.890,00:09:30.860
Let me draw it all.,00:09:30.860,00:09:32.270
So this is vector a.,00:09:32.270,00:09:34.810
"Vector b goes in
that direction.",00:09:34.810,00:09:39.320
"Hopefully you don't have a
thumb hanging down here.",00:09:39.320,00:09:41.010
"You know that a cross b in this
example will point up and",00:09:41.010,00:09:44.480
it's orthogonal to both.,00:09:44.480,00:09:48.160
"To kind of satisfy you a little
bit, that the vector's",00:09:48.160,00:09:50.740
"definitely orthogonal or that
this thing is definitely",00:09:50.740,00:09:53.570
"orthogonal to both of these,
let's just play with it and",00:09:53.570,00:09:55.720
"see that that definitely
is the case.",00:09:55.720,00:09:57.960
And what is orthogonal?,00:09:57.960,00:10:00.500
"What is in our context, the
definition of orthogonal?",00:10:00.500,00:10:04.490
Orthogonal vectors.,00:10:04.490,00:10:05.740
"If a and b are orthogonal, that
means that a dot b is",00:10:09.240,00:10:15.040
equal to 0.,00:10:15.040,00:10:15.770
"Remember, the difference
between orthogonal and",00:10:15.770,00:10:17.490
"perpendicular is that
orthogonal also",00:10:17.490,00:10:20.090
applies to 0 vectors.,00:10:20.090,00:10:21.340
"So these could also
be 0 vectors.",00:10:21.340,00:10:23.550
"Notice that I didn't say that
any of these guys up here had",00:10:23.550,00:10:26.910
to be nonzero.,00:10:26.910,00:10:28.140
"Well, in a little bit, we'll
talk about the angle between",00:10:28.140,00:10:30.450
"vectors and then you have
to assume nonzero.",00:10:30.450,00:10:32.280
"But if you're just taking a
cross product, nothing to stop",00:10:32.280,00:10:34.290
"you from taking-- no reason
why any of these",00:10:34.290,00:10:36.580
numbers can't be 0.,00:10:36.580,00:10:38.180
"But let me show you that
a cross b is definitely",00:10:38.180,00:10:43.530
orthogonal to both a and b.,00:10:43.530,00:10:45.710
"I think that might be somewhat
satisfying to you.",00:10:45.710,00:10:49.220
So let me copy a cross b here.,00:10:49.220,00:10:52.780
"I don't feel like
rewriting it.",00:10:52.780,00:10:56.710
OK.,00:10:56.710,00:10:58.250
Let me paste it.,00:10:58.250,00:11:00.500
"OK, bundle up little other
stuff with it.",00:11:00.500,00:11:03.310
"Let me take the dot product of
that with just my vector a,",00:11:06.940,00:11:12.800
"which was just a1, a2, a3.",00:11:12.800,00:11:17.730
"So what does the dot
product look like?",00:11:17.730,00:11:19.530
"That term times that, so it's
a1-- let me get some space.",00:11:19.530,00:11:24.260
"It's a1 times a2 b3 minus
a1 times that.",00:11:24.260,00:11:31.710
Minus a1 times a3 b2.,00:11:31.710,00:11:37.350
"And then you have plus
this times this.",00:11:37.350,00:11:40.110
So plus a2 times a3.,00:11:40.110,00:11:42.670
So plus a2 times a3 times b1.,00:11:42.670,00:11:47.530
And then minus a2 a1 b3.,00:11:47.530,00:11:55.720
"And then finally, plus-- I'll
just continue it down here.",00:11:55.720,00:11:59.180
"Plus a3 times a1 b2 minus
a3 times a2 b1.",00:11:59.180,00:12:10.050
"All I did I just took the
cross-- the dot product of",00:12:10.050,00:12:12.680
these two things.,00:12:12.680,00:12:13.590
I just took each of this.,00:12:13.590,00:12:14.750
"This guy times that was equal
to those two terms. That guy",00:12:14.750,00:12:18.010
"times that was equal to the next
two terms, equal to those",00:12:18.010,00:12:20.370
"two terms. And then this guy
times that was equal to those",00:12:20.370,00:12:22.840
"two terms. And if these guys
are really orthogonal, then",00:12:22.840,00:12:26.740
this should be equal to 0.,00:12:26.740,00:12:28.280
"So let's see if that's
the case.",00:12:28.280,00:12:30.020
"So I have an a1 a2 b3, a
positive here, and then I'm",00:12:30.020,00:12:35.030
"subtracting the same
thing here.",00:12:35.030,00:12:36.640
"This is the same thing as a1 a2
b3, but it's just a minus.",00:12:36.640,00:12:39.940
"So that will cancel
out with that.",00:12:39.940,00:12:43.380
"Let's see, what else
do we have?",00:12:43.380,00:12:44.460
We have a minus a1 a3 b2.,00:12:44.460,00:12:47.670
"We have a plus a1 a3 b2 there,
so these two are going to",00:12:47.670,00:12:51.740
cancel out.,00:12:51.740,00:12:52.950
"And I think you see where
this is going.",00:12:52.950,00:12:54.970
"You have a positive a2 a3 b1 and
then you have a negative",00:12:54.970,00:12:59.960
a2 a3 b1 there.,00:12:59.960,00:13:02.050
So these will also cancel out.,00:13:02.050,00:13:05.790
"Now, I just showed you that
it's orthogonal to a.",00:13:05.790,00:13:08.370
"Let me show you that it's
orthogonal to b.",00:13:08.370,00:13:11.110
"Let me get another version of
my-- the cross product of the",00:13:11.110,00:13:17.680
two vectors.,00:13:17.680,00:13:18.940
"Probably scroll down
a little bit.",00:13:18.940,00:13:21.640
And let me go back.,00:13:21.640,00:13:23.730
"And let me multiply that
times the vector b.",00:13:23.730,00:13:28.570
"b1, b2 and b3.",00:13:28.570,00:13:32.440
"I'll do it here just so
I have some space.",00:13:32.440,00:13:33.700
"So b1 times this whole thing
right here is b1 a2 b3 minus",00:13:33.700,00:13:43.430
b1 times this.,00:13:43.430,00:13:44.530
Minus b1 a3 b2.,00:13:44.530,00:13:49.360
Let me switch colors.,00:13:49.360,00:13:50.350
"And then b2 times this thing
here is going to be b2-- so",00:13:50.350,00:13:54.420
it's going to be plus.,00:13:54.420,00:13:56.690
"This is all really one
expression, I'm just writing",00:13:56.690,00:13:58.630
it on multiple lines.,00:13:58.630,00:13:59.430
This isn't a vector.,00:13:59.430,00:14:00.630
"Remember, when you take the dot
product of two things, you",00:14:00.630,00:14:03.030
get a scalar quantity.,00:14:03.030,00:14:03.990
So plus b2 times this thing.,00:14:03.990,00:14:06.020
So b2 a3 b1 minus b2 a1 b3.,00:14:06.020,00:14:14.450
"And then finally,
b3 times this.",00:14:14.450,00:14:17.730
"So plus b3 a1 b2
minus b3 a2 b1.",00:14:17.730,00:14:30.620
"So if these guys are definitely
orthogonal, then",00:14:30.620,00:14:32.970
this thing needs to equal 0.,00:14:32.970,00:14:34.460
"And let's see if that's
the case.",00:14:34.460,00:14:35.620
"We have a b1, a2, b3.",00:14:35.620,00:14:39.400
So b1 and a b3.,00:14:39.400,00:14:42.750
"b1 a2 b3, that's a positive
one and this",00:14:42.750,00:14:45.430
is a negative one.,00:14:45.430,00:14:46.190
"You have a b3, an a2 and a b1
so that and that cancel out.",00:14:46.190,00:14:50.860
"Here you have a minus
b1 a3 b2.",00:14:50.860,00:14:54.310
So you have a b1 and a b2.,00:14:54.310,00:14:56.550
It's a minus b1 a3 b2.,00:14:56.550,00:14:59.110
This is a plus the same thing.,00:14:59.110,00:15:01.530
"Just switching the order
of the multiplication.",00:15:01.530,00:15:03.400
"But these two are
the same term.",00:15:03.400,00:15:04.620
"They're just opposites of each
other, so they cancel out.",00:15:04.620,00:15:07.560
"And then finally, you have
a b2, an a1 and a b3.",00:15:07.560,00:15:10.740
It's a negative.,00:15:10.740,00:15:11.410
"And then you have a positive
version of the same thing.",00:15:11.410,00:15:14.000
So these two guys cancel out.,00:15:14.000,00:15:15.990
"So you see that this
is also equal to 0.",00:15:15.990,00:15:19.860
"So hopefully you're satisfied
that this vector right here is",00:15:19.860,00:15:23.360
"definitely orthogonal
to both a and b.",00:15:23.360,00:15:25.800
"And that's because that's
how it was designed.",00:15:25.800,00:15:27.610
This is a definition.,00:15:27.610,00:15:28.980
"You could do a little bit of
algebra and you could have",00:15:28.980,00:15:31.510
"without me explaining this
definition to you, you could",00:15:31.510,00:15:34.680
"have actually come up with this
definition on your own.",00:15:34.680,00:15:37.440
"But obviously this was kind
of designed to have other",00:15:37.440,00:15:40.000
interesting properties to it.,00:15:40.000,00:15:41.920
"And I'll cover those in the next
few videos, so hopefully",00:15:41.920,00:15:45.010
you found that helpful.,00:15:45.010,00:15:46.730
