"In the last video I had this 2
by 3 matrix A right here, and",00:00:00.510,00:00:05.070
"we figured out all of the
subspaces that are associated",00:00:05.070,00:00:08.820
with this matrix.,00:00:08.820,00:00:09.455
"We figured out its null space,
its column space, we figured",00:00:09.455,00:00:13.370
"out the null space and column
space of its transpose, which",00:00:13.370,00:00:16.260
"you could also call the left
null space, and the row space,",00:00:16.260,00:00:19.930
"or what's essentially the space
spanned by A's rows.",00:00:19.930,00:00:23.580
"Let's write it all in one place,
because I realize it",00:00:23.580,00:00:25.840
"got a little disjointed, and see
if we can visualize what",00:00:25.840,00:00:29.050
"all of these look
like, especially",00:00:29.050,00:00:30.490
relative to each other.,00:00:30.490,00:00:31.620
"So let me copy and paste
my original matrix.",00:00:31.620,00:00:36.180
"Copy, and then let me scroll
down here and paste it over",00:00:36.180,00:00:40.800
"here, and hit paste.",00:00:40.800,00:00:44.270
"Let me see if I can find
our key takeaways",00:00:44.270,00:00:49.190
from the last video.,00:00:49.190,00:00:50.580
"So our column space right here,
of A, was this thing",00:00:50.580,00:00:55.410
right here.,00:00:55.410,00:00:55.900
Let me write this.,00:00:55.900,00:00:57.690
This was our column space.,00:00:57.690,00:00:59.000
"It was the span of the
R2 vector 2, 4.",00:00:59.000,00:01:02.320
Let me copy that.,00:01:02.320,00:01:04.870
Copy that and bring it down.,00:01:04.870,00:01:08.366
Hit paste.,00:01:08.366,00:01:10.170
This was our column space.,00:01:10.170,00:01:12.000
Let me write that.,00:01:12.000,00:01:13.610
This is the column space of A.,00:01:13.610,00:01:18.100
"It was equal to that
right there.",00:01:18.100,00:01:20.160
"And now what other things
do we know?",00:01:20.160,00:01:24.290
"Well, we know that the left null
space was a span of 2, 1.",00:01:24.290,00:01:29.000
Let me write that.,00:01:29.000,00:01:31.160
"So our left null space, or the
null space of our transpose,",00:01:31.160,00:01:35.880
"either way, it was equal to the
span of the R2 vector 2,",00:01:35.880,00:01:41.895
"1, just like that.",00:01:41.895,00:01:47.190
"And then what was
our null space?",00:01:47.190,00:01:49.820
"Our null space we figured
out in the last video.",00:01:49.820,00:01:54.020
Here it is.,00:01:54.020,00:01:54.510
"It's the span of these
two R3 vectors.",00:01:54.510,00:01:57.140
Let me copy and paste that.,00:01:57.140,00:01:58.440
Hit copy.,00:02:01.390,00:02:03.690
Let me go down here.,00:02:03.690,00:02:05.152
Let me paste it.,00:02:05.152,00:02:08.759
"So that was our null
space right there.",00:02:08.759,00:02:11.620
"And then finally, what
was our row space?",00:02:11.620,00:02:15.100
"What was our row space or the
column space of our transpose?",00:02:15.100,00:02:18.860
"So the column space of our
transpose was the span of this",00:02:23.520,00:02:27.850
"R3 vector right there, So it
was this one right here.",00:02:27.850,00:02:33.220
So let me copy and paste it.,00:02:33.220,00:02:35.160
"Copy and scroll down, and we can
paste it just like that.",00:02:35.160,00:02:44.710
"OK, let's see if we can
visualize this now, now that",00:02:44.710,00:02:47.980
we have them all in one place.,00:02:47.980,00:02:49.990
"So first of all, if we imagine
a transformation, x, that is",00:02:49.990,00:02:57.170
"equal to A times x, our
transformation is going to be",00:02:57.170,00:03:02.160
"a mapping from what? x would be
a member of R3, so R3 would",00:03:02.160,00:03:06.630
be our domain.,00:03:06.630,00:03:07.670
"So it would be a mapping from
R3 and then it would be a",00:03:07.670,00:03:10.340
"mapping to R2 because we have
two rows here, right?",00:03:10.340,00:03:13.390
"You multiply a 2-by-3 matrix
times a 3-by-1 vector, and",00:03:13.390,00:03:21.300
"you're going to get a 2-by-1
vector, so it's going to be a",00:03:21.300,00:03:23.330
mapping to R2.,00:03:23.330,00:03:26.090
So that's our codomain.,00:03:26.090,00:03:26.850
"So let's draw our domains
and our codomains.",00:03:26.850,00:03:29.070
"I'll just write them very
generally right here.",00:03:31.940,00:03:34.250
"So you could imagine
R3 is our domain.",00:03:34.250,00:03:39.660
"And then our codomain is going
to be R2 just like that.",00:03:39.660,00:03:45.320
"And our T is a mapping, or you
could even imagine A is a",00:03:47.955,00:03:51.020
"mapping between any vector there
and any vector there",00:03:51.020,00:03:53.750
when you multiply them.,00:03:53.750,00:03:55.340
"Now, what is our column
space of A?",00:03:55.340,00:04:00.150
"Our column space of A is the
span of the vector 2 minus 4.",00:04:00.150,00:04:04.260
It's an R2 vector.,00:04:04.260,00:04:05.470
This is a subspace of R2.,00:04:05.470,00:04:09.200
We could write this.,00:04:09.200,00:04:10.340
So let me write this.,00:04:10.340,00:04:11.430
"So our column space of A, these
are just all of the",00:04:11.430,00:04:16.420
"vectors that are spanned
by this.",00:04:16.420,00:04:18.089
"We figured out that these guys
are just multiples of this",00:04:18.089,00:04:21.490
"first guy, or we could have
done it the other way.",00:04:21.490,00:04:22.825
"We could have said this guy and
that guy are multiples of",00:04:22.825,00:04:25.820
"that guy, either way.",00:04:25.820,00:04:26.810
"But the basis is just one
of these vectors.",00:04:26.810,00:04:29.060
"We just have to have one of
these vectors, and so it was",00:04:29.060,00:04:31.590
equal to this right here.,00:04:31.590,00:04:33.660
"So the column space
is a subset of R2.",00:04:33.660,00:04:38.915
"And what else is
a subset of R2?",00:04:38.915,00:04:41.800
"Well, our left null space.",00:04:41.800,00:04:43.650
"Our left null space is
also a subset of R2.",00:04:43.650,00:04:46.300
"So let's graph them, actually.",00:04:53.530,00:04:55.570
"So I won't be too exact,
but you can imagine.",00:04:55.570,00:04:58.950
"Let's see, if we draw the
vector 2, 4-- let me",00:04:58.950,00:05:02.680
draw some axes here.,00:05:02.680,00:05:04.670
"Let me scroll down
a little bit.",00:05:04.670,00:05:07.220
"So if you have some vector--
let me draw my-- do this as",00:05:07.220,00:05:11.470
neatly as possible.,00:05:11.470,00:05:12.816
That's my vertical axis.,00:05:12.816,00:05:15.200
That is my horizontal axis.,00:05:15.200,00:05:17.910
"And then, what does the span of
our column space look like?",00:05:17.910,00:05:23.490
"So you draw the vector 2, minus
4, so you're going to go",00:05:26.820,00:05:30.070
"out one, two, and then you're
going to go down one, two,",00:05:30.070,00:05:33.740
"three, four.",00:05:33.740,00:05:35.200
"So that's what that
vector looks like.",00:05:35.200,00:05:36.800
"And the span of this vector
is essentially all of the",00:05:39.340,00:05:42.420
"multiples of this vector, where
you could say linear",00:05:42.420,00:05:44.970
"combinations of it, but you're
taking a combination of just",00:05:44.970,00:05:47.565
"one vector, so it's just going
to be all of the multiples of",00:05:47.565,00:05:49.530
this vector.,00:05:49.530,00:05:50.700
"So if I were to graph it, it
would just be a line that is",00:05:50.700,00:05:55.750
"specified by all of the linear
combinations of that vector",00:05:55.750,00:05:59.030
right there.,00:05:59.030,00:06:02.030
"This right here is a graphical
representation of the column",00:06:02.030,00:06:04.665
space of A.,00:06:04.665,00:06:07.160
"Now, let's look at the left null
space of A, or you could",00:06:07.160,00:06:10.140
"imagine, the null space
of the transpose.",00:06:10.140,00:06:12.130
They are the same thing.,00:06:12.130,00:06:13.680
You saw why in the last video.,00:06:13.680,00:06:15.780
What does this look like?,00:06:15.780,00:06:18.020
"So the left null space
is a span of 2, 1.",00:06:18.020,00:06:20.830
"So if you graph 2, and then you
go up 1, it's the graph of",00:06:20.830,00:06:24.980
"2, 1, and it looks like this.",00:06:24.980,00:06:26.780
"Let me do it in a
different color.",00:06:26.780,00:06:28.840
"So that's what the vector
looks like.",00:06:28.840,00:06:30.860
"The vector looks like that,
but of course, we want the",00:06:30.860,00:06:33.700
"span of that vector, so it's
going to be all of the",00:06:33.700,00:06:36.570
combinations.,00:06:36.570,00:06:38.670
"All you can do when you combine
one vector is just",00:06:38.670,00:06:40.800
"multiply it by a bunch of
scalars, so it's going to be",00:06:40.800,00:06:42.640
"all of the scalar multiples
of that vector.",00:06:42.640,00:06:44.735
So let me draw it like that.,00:06:44.735,00:06:46.880
It's going to be like that.,00:06:46.880,00:06:49.110
"And the first thing you might
notice, let me write this.",00:06:49.110,00:06:50.980
"This is our left null space
of A or the null",00:06:50.980,00:06:55.970
space of our transpose.,00:06:55.970,00:06:57.210
"This is equal to the left
null space of A.",00:06:57.210,00:07:04.965
"And actually, since we're
writing, we wrote this in",00:07:07.870,00:07:09.670
terms of A transpose.,00:07:09.670,00:07:10.660
"It's the null space of A
transpose, which is the left",00:07:10.660,00:07:13.060
null space of A.,00:07:13.060,00:07:14.060
"Let's write the column
space of A also",00:07:14.060,00:07:15.900
in terms of A transpose.,00:07:15.900,00:07:17.640
"This is equal to the row space
of A transpose, right?",00:07:17.640,00:07:24.600
"If you're looking at the columns
of A, everything it",00:07:24.600,00:07:26.400
"spans, the columns of A are the
same things as the rows of",00:07:26.400,00:07:29.110
A transpose.,00:07:29.110,00:07:30.450
"But the first thing that you
see, when I just at least",00:07:30.450,00:07:32.510
"visually drew it like this, is
that these two spaces look to",00:07:32.510,00:07:36.710
be orthogonal to each other.,00:07:36.710,00:07:38.400
It looks like I drew it in R2.,00:07:38.400,00:07:39.670
"It looks like there's a
90-degree angle there.",00:07:39.670,00:07:41.720
"And if we wanted to verify it,
all we have to do is take the",00:07:41.720,00:07:44.000
dot product.,00:07:44.000,00:07:45.230
"Well, any vector that is in our
column space, you could",00:07:45.230,00:07:55.400
"take an arbitrary vector that's
in our column space,",00:07:55.400,00:07:58.110
"it's going to be equal
to c times 2 minus 4.",00:07:58.110,00:08:02.650
So let me write that down.,00:08:02.650,00:08:03.900
I want this stuff up here.,00:08:08.440,00:08:09.370
I'll scroll down a little bit.,00:08:09.370,00:08:10.660
"Let's say v1 is a member
of our column space.",00:08:13.780,00:08:16.650
"And that means that v1 is going
to be equal to some",00:08:19.380,00:08:23.170
"scalar multiple times the
spanning vector of our column",00:08:23.170,00:08:27.270
"space, so some scale or
multiple of this.",00:08:27.270,00:08:29.470
"So we could say it's equal
to c1 times 2 minus 4.",00:08:29.470,00:08:36.880
"That's some member of
our column space.",00:08:36.880,00:08:39.150
"Now, if we want some member of
our left null space-- let's",00:08:39.150,00:08:44.220
write it here.,00:08:44.220,00:08:44.990
"So let's say that v2 is some
member of our left null space,",00:08:44.990,00:08:53.900
"or the null space of
the transpose, then",00:08:53.900,00:08:57.430
what does that mean?,00:08:57.430,00:08:58.050
"That means v2 is going to be
equal to some scalar multiple",00:08:58.050,00:09:01.820
"of the spanning vector of our
left null space of 2, 1.",00:09:01.820,00:09:05.130
"So any vector that's in our
column space could be",00:09:08.480,00:09:10.540
represented this way.,00:09:10.540,00:09:11.770
"Any vector in our left
null space can be",00:09:11.770,00:09:13.410
represented this way.,00:09:13.410,00:09:14.620
"Now, what happens if you take
the dot product of these two",00:09:14.620,00:09:16.720
characters?,00:09:16.720,00:09:17.695
So let me do it down here.,00:09:17.695,00:09:20.570
"I want to save some space for
what we're going to do in R3,",00:09:20.570,00:09:23.850
"but let me take the dot
product of these two",00:09:23.850,00:09:25.880
characters.,00:09:25.880,00:09:26.910
"So v1 dot v2 is equal to--
I'll arbitrarily switch",00:09:26.910,00:09:33.460
"colors-- c1 times 2 minus
4 dot c2 times 2, 1.",00:09:33.460,00:09:42.840
"And then the scalars, we've
seen this before.",00:09:42.840,00:09:45.630
"You can just say that this is
the same thing as c1, c2 times",00:09:45.630,00:09:51.420
"the dot product of 2
minus 4 dot 2, 1.",00:09:51.420,00:09:56.620
"And then what is
this equal to?",00:09:56.620,00:09:58.600
"This is going to be equal to
c1, c2 times 2 times 2 is 4",00:09:58.600,00:10:05.130
plus minus 4 times 1: minus 4.,00:10:05.130,00:10:09.090
"Well, this is going to be equal
to 0, so this whole",00:10:09.090,00:10:11.280
"expression is going
to be equal to 0.",00:10:11.280,00:10:12.805
"And this was for any two vectors
that are members of",00:10:12.805,00:10:15.350
"our column space and our
left null space.",00:10:15.350,00:10:17.090
"They're orthogonal
to each other.",00:10:17.090,00:10:18.950
"So every member of our column
space is going to be",00:10:18.950,00:10:22.160
"orthogonal to every member of
our left null space, or every",00:10:22.160,00:10:26.660
"member of the null space of our
transpose, and that was",00:10:26.660,00:10:29.980
the case in this example.,00:10:29.980,00:10:31.270
"It actually turns out this is
always going to be the case,",00:10:31.270,00:10:35.360
"that your column space of
a matrix, its orthogonal",00:10:35.360,00:10:39.530
"complement is the left null
space, or the null space of",00:10:39.530,00:10:43.280
its transpose.,00:10:43.280,00:10:44.300
"I'll prove that probably in the
next video, either in the",00:10:44.300,00:10:46.640
"next video or the video after
that, but you can see it",00:10:46.640,00:10:48.770
visually for this example.,00:10:48.770,00:10:50.680
"Now let's draw the other two
characters that we're",00:10:50.680,00:10:55.620
dealing with here.,00:10:55.620,00:10:57.310
"So we have our null space, which
is the span of these two",00:10:57.310,00:11:03.930
vectors in R3.,00:11:03.930,00:11:04.950
"It's a little bit more difficult
to draw it, these",00:11:04.950,00:11:08.330
two vectors in R3 right there.,00:11:08.330,00:11:10.430
"But what is the span of
two vectors in R3?",00:11:10.430,00:11:13.510
"All of the linear combinations
of two vectors in R3 is going",00:11:13.510,00:11:16.135
to be a plane in R3.,00:11:16.135,00:11:18.000
"So I'll draw it in just very
general terms right here.",00:11:18.000,00:11:21.045
"If we draw it in just very
general terms, let me see.",00:11:21.045,00:11:25.860
"So it's a plane in R3 that
looks like that.",00:11:25.860,00:11:30.410
"Maybe I'll fill in the plane
a little bit, give you some",00:11:30.410,00:11:33.300
sense of what it looks like.,00:11:33.300,00:11:34.370
This is the null space of A.,00:11:34.370,00:11:38.640
"It's spanned by these
two vectors.",00:11:38.640,00:11:40.960
"Now, you could imagine these
two vectors look something",00:11:40.960,00:11:42.950
"like-- I'm drawing it very
general, but if you take any",00:11:42.950,00:11:45.990
"linear combinations of these two
guys, you're going to get",00:11:45.990,00:11:49.800
"any vector that's along this
plane that goes in infinite",00:11:49.800,00:11:54.040
directions.,00:11:54.040,00:11:54.480
"And, of course, the origin
will be in these.",00:11:54.480,00:11:56.000
"All of these are valid
subspaces.",00:11:56.000,00:11:58.090
"Now, what does the row
space of A look like?",00:11:58.090,00:12:05.930
"Or you could say the column
space of A transpose?",00:12:05.930,00:12:08.820
"Well, it's the span of this
vector in R3, but let's see",00:12:08.820,00:12:15.000
"something interesting about
this vector in R3.",00:12:15.000,00:12:17.580
"How does it relate to
these two vectors?",00:12:17.580,00:12:20.090
"Well, you may not see it
immediately, although if you",00:12:20.090,00:12:22.200
"look at it closely, it might pop
out at you, that this guy",00:12:22.200,00:12:24.910
"is orthogonal to both
of these guys.",00:12:24.910,00:12:28.670
"Notice, if you take the dot
product of 2 minus 1 minus 3,",00:12:28.670,00:12:37.170
"and you dotted it with 1/2, 1,
0, what are you going to get?",00:12:37.170,00:12:43.360
"You're going to get 2 times 1/2,
which is 1, plus minus 1",00:12:43.360,00:12:46.720
"times 1, which is minus
1, plus minus 3",00:12:46.720,00:12:49.190
"times 0, which is 0.",00:12:49.190,00:12:51.390
"So that's when I dotted that guy
with that guy right there.",00:12:51.390,00:12:55.230
"And then, when I take the dot
of this guy with that guy,",00:12:55.230,00:12:57.490
what do you get?,00:12:57.490,00:12:58.150
"You get 3/2, 0 and 1, dotted
with-- let me scroll down a",00:12:58.150,00:13:04.580
little bit.,00:13:04.580,00:13:05.210
"I don't want to write too
small-- dotted with 1, dotted",00:13:05.210,00:13:11.650
with 2 minus 1 minus 3.,00:13:11.650,00:13:16.440
"In the row space of A,
I wrote the spanning",00:13:16.440,00:13:20.010
vector there this time.,00:13:20.010,00:13:21.970
"I probably shouldn't have
switched the order.",00:13:21.970,00:13:23.280
"But here, I'm dotting it with
this guy, and then here, I'm",00:13:23.280,00:13:26.230
"dotting it with this
guy right there.",00:13:26.230,00:13:28.110
"So if you take it, 3/2 times 2
is equal to 3 plus 0 times",00:13:28.110,00:13:33.860
"minus 1 is 0, plus 1 times minus
3 is minus 3, so it's",00:13:33.860,00:13:37.966
equal to 0.,00:13:37.966,00:13:39.490
"So the fact that this guy is
orthogonal to both of these",00:13:39.490,00:13:44.350
"spanning vectors, it also means
that it's orthogonal to",00:13:44.350,00:13:46.530
"any linear combination
of those guys.",00:13:46.530,00:13:48.470
"Maybe it might be useful
for you to see that.",00:13:48.470,00:13:51.410
"So let's take some member
of our null space.",00:13:51.410,00:13:58.640
"So let's say the vector v3 is
a member of our null space.",00:13:58.640,00:14:04.020
"That means it's a linear
combination of that",00:14:07.320,00:14:11.680
guy and that guy.,00:14:11.680,00:14:13.340
"Those are the two spanning
vectors.",00:14:13.340,00:14:14.850
I'd written it up here.,00:14:14.850,00:14:16.970
"These are our two spanning
vectors.",00:14:16.970,00:14:18.930
"I need the space down here,
so let me scroll",00:14:18.930,00:14:20.860
down a little bit.,00:14:20.860,00:14:21.520
"These are the two spanning
vectors.",00:14:21.520,00:14:22.840
"So that means that v3 can be
written as some linear",00:14:22.840,00:14:27.910
"combination of these two guys
that I squared off in pink.",00:14:27.910,00:14:31.780
"So let me just write it as maybe
A times 3/2, 0, 1 plus b",00:14:31.780,00:14:40.810
"times 1/2, 1, 0.",00:14:40.810,00:14:48.520
"Now, what happens if I take the
dot product of v3 and I",00:14:48.520,00:14:56.900
"dot it with any member of
my row space right here?",00:14:56.900,00:15:03.110
"So any member of my row space
is going to be a multiple of",00:15:03.110,00:15:08.650
this guy right here.,00:15:08.650,00:15:09.490
"That is the spanning vector
of my row space.",00:15:09.490,00:15:12.170
"Just let me actually
create that.",00:15:12.170,00:15:13.750
"So let me say that v4 is a
member of my row space, which",00:15:13.750,00:15:20.750
"is the column space of
the transpose of A.",00:15:20.750,00:15:23.800
"And that means that v4 is equal
to, let's say, some",00:15:23.800,00:15:28.500
scaling vector.,00:15:28.500,00:15:29.300
I always use c a lot.,00:15:29.300,00:15:30.860
Let me use d.,00:15:30.860,00:15:32.200
"Let's say it's d times
my spanning vector.",00:15:32.200,00:15:34.490
"d times 2 minus 1, 3.",00:15:34.490,00:15:38.520
"So what is v3, which is just
any member of my null space",00:15:38.520,00:15:43.520
"dotted with v4, which is any
member of my row space?",00:15:43.520,00:15:50.420
"So what is this going
to be equal to?",00:15:50.420,00:15:52.740
"This is going to be
equal to this guy.",00:15:52.740,00:15:57.890
So let me write it like this.,00:15:57.890,00:15:59.620
"A times 3/2, 0, 1 plus v times
1/2, 1, 0 dotted with this",00:15:59.620,00:16:13.850
"guy, dot d times 2 minus 1, 3.",00:16:13.850,00:16:18.830
"Now, what is this going
to be equal to?",00:16:18.830,00:16:20.500
"Well, we know all of
the properties",00:16:20.500,00:16:22.310
of vector dot products.,00:16:22.310,00:16:23.930
"We can distribute it and then
take the scalars out.",00:16:23.930,00:16:26.330
"So this is going to be equal
to-- I'll skip a few steps",00:16:26.330,00:16:28.940
"here, but it's going to be equal
to-- ad times the dot",00:16:28.940,00:16:32.970
"product of 3/2, 0, 1, dot 2
minus 1, 3-- just distribute",00:16:32.970,00:16:41.755
"it out to here-- plus bd times
the dot product of 1/2, 1, 0,",00:16:41.755,00:16:50.790
"dotted with 2 minus 1, 3.",00:16:50.790,00:16:54.410
This is the dot product.,00:16:54.410,00:16:55.660
"I just distributed this
term along these",00:16:55.660,00:16:57.400
two terms right here.,00:16:57.400,00:16:58.670
"And we already know what these
dot products are equal to.",00:16:58.670,00:17:01.040
We did it right here.,00:17:01.040,00:17:02.410
"This dot product right here
is that dot product.",00:17:02.410,00:17:04.800
"I just switched the order,
so this is equal to 0.",00:17:04.800,00:17:07.420
"And this dot product is that dot
product, so this is also",00:17:07.420,00:17:10.700
equal to 0.,00:17:10.700,00:17:12.369
"So you take any member of your
row space and you dot it with",00:17:12.369,00:17:17.190
"any member of your null space,
and you're going to get 0, or",00:17:17.190,00:17:21.819
"any member of your row space is
orthogonal to any member of",00:17:21.819,00:17:25.690
your null space.,00:17:25.690,00:17:27.170
"And I did all of that to
help our visualization.",00:17:27.170,00:17:29.720
"So we just saw that any member
of our row space, which is the",00:17:29.720,00:17:32.420
"span of this vector, is
orthogonal to any member of or",00:17:32.420,00:17:36.930
null space.,00:17:36.930,00:17:37.790
"So my row space, which is just
going to be a line in R3",00:17:37.790,00:17:40.200
"because it's just a multiple
of a vector.",00:17:40.200,00:17:41.550
It's going to look like this.,00:17:41.550,00:17:42.800
"It's going to be a line,
and then it's going to",00:17:45.780,00:17:47.500
maybe go behind it.,00:17:47.500,00:17:48.170
You can't see it there.,00:17:48.170,00:17:49.100
"It's going to look like that,
but it's going to be",00:17:49.100,00:17:50.710
orthogonal.,00:17:50.710,00:17:51.605
So let me draw it.,00:17:51.605,00:17:52.690
"So this pink line right here in
R3, that is our row space",00:17:52.690,00:17:59.440
"of A, which is equal to the
column space of A transpose",00:17:59.440,00:18:03.540
"because the rows of A are the
same thing as the columns of A",00:18:03.540,00:18:06.500
"transposed, and the row space
is just the space spanned by",00:18:06.500,00:18:09.820
your row vectors.,00:18:09.820,00:18:11.030
"And then this is the null space
of A, which is a plane.",00:18:11.030,00:18:16.850
"It's spanned by two
vectors in R3.",00:18:16.850,00:18:19.240
"Or we could also call
that the left",00:18:19.240,00:18:22.750
null space of A transpose.,00:18:22.750,00:18:29.800
"And I never used this term in
the last video, but it's",00:18:29.800,00:18:31.590
"symmetric, right?",00:18:31.590,00:18:32.620
"If the null space of A transpose
is the left null",00:18:32.620,00:18:34.880
"space of A, then the null space
of A is the left null",00:18:34.880,00:18:37.710
"space of A transpose, which is
an interesting takeaway.",00:18:37.710,00:18:42.810
"Notice that you have here the
row space of A is orthogonal",00:18:42.810,00:18:50.570
to the null space of A.,00:18:50.570,00:18:52.520
"And here, you have the row
space of A transpose is",00:18:52.520,00:18:56.640
"orthogonal to the null
space of A transpose.",00:18:56.640,00:18:59.750
"Or you could say the left null
space of A is orthogonal to",00:18:59.750,00:19:03.750
the column space of A.,00:19:03.750,00:19:05.350
"Or you could say the left null
space of A transpose is",00:19:05.350,00:19:08.220
"orthogonal to the column
space of A transpose.",00:19:08.220,00:19:11.780
"So these are just
very interesting",00:19:11.780,00:19:13.280
"takeaways, in general.",00:19:13.280,00:19:15.890
"And just like I said here, that
look, these happen to be",00:19:15.890,00:19:18.290
orthogonal.,00:19:18.290,00:19:18.830
"These also happen to
be orthogonal.",00:19:18.830,00:19:20.460
"And this isn't just some
strange coincidence.",00:19:20.460,00:19:22.590
"In the next video or two, I'll
show you that this space, this",00:19:22.590,00:19:26.490
"pink space, is the orthogonal
complement of the null space",00:19:26.490,00:19:30.780
"right here, which means it
represents all of the vectors",00:19:30.780,00:19:36.710
"that are orthogonal
to the null space.",00:19:36.710,00:19:39.100
"And these two guys
are orthogonal",00:19:39.100,00:19:41.110
complements to each other.,00:19:41.110,00:19:42.130
"They each represent all of the
vectors that are orthogonal to",00:19:42.130,00:19:45.910
"the other guy in their
respective spaces.",00:19:45.910,00:19:49.210
