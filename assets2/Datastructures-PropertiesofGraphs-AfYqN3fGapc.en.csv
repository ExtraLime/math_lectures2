"In our previous lesson, we introduced you
to graphs.",00:00:00.510,00:00:03.050
"We defined graph as a mathematical or
logical model",00:00:03.050,00:00:06.670
"and talked about some of the
properties and applications of graph.",00:00:06.670,00:00:10.559
"Now in this lesson, we will discuss some
more properties of graph",00:00:10.559,00:00:13.929
"but first I want to do a quick recap of
what we have discussed in our previous",00:00:13.929,00:00:17.640
lesson.,00:00:17.640,00:00:18.630
"A graph can be defined as an ordered
pair of",00:00:18.630,00:00:21.760
a set of vertices and a set of edges.,00:00:21.760,00:00:24.890
"We use this formal mathematical
notation G = (V,E)",00:00:24.890,00:00:29.250
"to define a graph, here V is set of
vertices and",00:00:29.250,00:00:33.219
"E is set of edges. Ordered pair is just a
pair of mathematical objects in which",00:00:33.219,00:00:38.700
"order of objects in the pair matters. It
matters which element is first and which",00:00:38.700,00:00:43.450
element is second in the pair.,00:00:43.450,00:00:45.030
"Now as we know to denote number of
elements in a set",00:00:45.030,00:00:48.430
"that we also call cardinality of a set.
We use the same notation that we used",00:00:48.430,00:00:53.600
for modulus or absolute value.,00:00:53.600,00:00:55.920
"So this is how we can denote number of
vertices and number of",00:00:55.920,00:01:00.640
edges in a graph. Number of vertices,00:01:00.640,00:01:03.640
"would be number of elements in set V
and number of edges would be number of",00:01:03.640,00:01:07.540
elements,00:01:07.540,00:01:08.049
"in set E. Moving forward, this is how I'm
going to denote number of vertices and",00:01:08.049,00:01:12.330
number of edges,00:01:12.330,00:01:13.390
"in all my explanations. Now as we had
discussed earlier,",00:01:13.390,00:01:17.030
"edges in a graph can either be
directed that is 1 way connections",00:01:17.030,00:01:21.659
"or undirected that is 2 way
connections. A graph with only directed ",00:01:21.659,00:01:26.530
edges is called,00:01:26.530,00:01:27.330
"a directed graph or digraph and a
graph with only undirected edges is called",00:01:27.330,00:01:32.320
a undirected graph.,00:01:32.320,00:01:33.780
"Now sometimes all connections in a
graph cannot be treated as",00:01:33.780,00:01:37.430
"equal, so we label edges with some weight",00:01:37.430,00:01:41.119
"or cost like what i'm showing here and
a graph in which some value is associated",00:01:41.119,00:01:46.950
to connections,00:01:46.950,00:01:47.920
as cost or weight is called a weighted graph.,00:01:47.920,00:01:51.560
A graph is unweighted if there is no cost,00:01:51.560,00:01:54.960
"distinction among edges. Okay, now we can
also have some special kind of edges in",00:01:54.960,00:01:59.840
a graph.,00:01:59.840,00:02:00.479
"These edges complicate algorithms and
make working with graphs difficult",00:02:00.479,00:02:04.939
"but I'm going to talk about them anyway.
An edge is called a self loop",00:02:04.939,00:02:09.110
"or self edge if it involves only 1
vertex.",00:02:09.110,00:02:13.170
If both endpoint of an edge are same,00:02:13.170,00:02:16.410
"then it's called a self loop. We can
have a self loop in both directed and",00:02:16.410,00:02:21.540
undirected,00:02:21.540,00:02:22.250
"graphs but the question is why would we
ever have a self loop in a graph.",00:02:22.250,00:02:26.970
"Well, sometimes if edges are depicting
some relationship or connection",00:02:26.970,00:02:31.319
"that's possible with the same node as
origin as well as destination",00:02:31.319,00:02:36.540
"then we can have a self loop. For example
as we discussed in our previous lesson,",00:02:36.540,00:02:42.050
"interlinked web pages on the internet
or the world wide web can be",00:02:42.050,00:02:46.560
"it presented as a directed graph. A page
with a unique URL can be a node in the",00:02:46.560,00:02:51.890
graph and we can have a directed,00:02:51.890,00:02:53.640
"edge if a page contains link to another
page. Now",00:02:53.640,00:02:57.220
"we can have a self loop in this graph
because its very much possible for a",00:02:57.220,00:03:02.080
"webpage to have a link to itself. Have a look
at this webpage",00:03:02.080,00:03:06.790
mycodeschool.com/videos.,00:03:06.790,00:03:08.080
"In the header, we have links for workouts
page,",00:03:08.080,00:03:11.190
"problems page and videos page.
Right now I'm already on videos page",00:03:11.190,00:03:16.680
"but I can still click on videos link and
all that will happen with the click is",00:03:16.680,00:03:21.750
refresh,00:03:21.750,00:03:22.300
"because I'm already on videos page. My
origin and destination",00:03:22.300,00:03:26.810
"are same here, so if I'm representing
world wide web as a directed graph",00:03:26.810,00:03:31.340
"the way we just discussed then we have
self loop here.",00:03:31.340,00:03:35.170
"Now the next special type of edge that
I want to talk about is multi-edge.",00:03:35.170,00:03:39.190
An edge is called a multi-edge,00:03:39.190,00:03:42.810
"if it occurs more than once in a graph.
Once again, we can have a multi-edge in",00:03:42.810,00:03:46.480
both directed and undirected graphs.,00:03:46.480,00:03:48.900
"First multi edge that I'm showing you here
is undirected and the second 1 is",00:03:48.900,00:03:53.200
directed.,00:03:53.200,00:03:53.830
"Now once again, the question why should
be ever have a multi-edge.",00:03:53.830,00:03:57.790
"Well, let's say we are representing flight
network between cities as a graph.",00:03:57.790,00:04:02.250
"A city would be a node and we can have
an edge if",00:04:02.250,00:04:05.549
"there is a direct flight connection
between any 2 cities,",00:04:05.549,00:04:08.819
"but then there can be multiple flights
between a pair of cities.",00:04:08.819,00:04:12.189
"These flights would have different names
and may have different costs.",00:04:12.189,00:04:16.900
"If I want to keep the information about
all the flights in my graph,",00:04:16.900,00:04:20.780
"I can draw multi-edges. I can draw 1
directed edge for",00:04:20.780,00:04:24.600
"each flight and then I can label an edge
with its cost or any other property.",00:04:24.600,00:04:30.310
"I just labeled edges here with some
random flight numbers.",00:04:30.310,00:04:33.750
"Now as we were saying earlier, self loops
and multi-edges",00:04:33.750,00:04:37.290
"often complicate working with graph. Their
presence means",00:04:37.290,00:04:41.210
"we need to take extra care while solving
problems.",00:04:41.210,00:04:44.250
"If a graph contains no self loops or multi-edge
then it's called a simple graph.",00:04:44.250,00:04:49.070
"In our lessons, we will mostly be dealing
with simple graphs.",00:04:49.070,00:04:52.910
"Now I want you to answer a very simple
question. Given a number of vertices",00:04:52.910,00:04:57.160
"in a simple graphs that is a a graph 
with no self loops or multi-edge,",00:04:57.160,00:05:01.270
"what would be maximum possible number of
edges.",00:05:01.270,00:05:05.060
"Well, let's see. Let's say, we want to draw
a directed graph",00:05:05.060,00:05:09.060
"with 4 vertices. I have drawn 4
vertices here.",00:05:09.060,00:05:12.259
"I'll name these vertices V1, V2, V3
and V4.",00:05:12.259,00:05:17.020
"So this is my set of vertices. Number
of elements in set V",00:05:17.020,00:05:20.860
"is 4. Now it's perfectly fine if I
choose",00:05:20.860,00:05:24.820
"not to draw any age here. This will still
be a graph.",00:05:24.820,00:05:28.570
"Set of edges can be empty, nodes can be
totally disconnected.",00:05:28.570,00:05:32.770
"So minimum possible number of edges in a
graph is zero.",00:05:32.770,00:05:36.310
"Now if this is a directed graph, what do
you think can be maximum number of edges",00:05:36.310,00:05:40.830
here.,00:05:40.830,00:05:41.620
"Well, each node can have directed edges
to all other nodes.",00:05:41.620,00:05:45.900
"In this figure here, each node can have
directed edges",00:05:45.900,00:05:49.620
"to 3 other nodes. We have 4 nodes in
total,",00:05:49.620,00:05:53.330
"so maximum possible number of edges here
is",00:05:53.330,00:05:56.610
"4 * 3 that is 12. I have shown
edges originating from a vertex in same",00:05:56.610,00:06:01.580
color here.,00:06:01.580,00:06:02.979
"This is the maximum that we can draw if
there is no self loop or",00:06:02.979,00:06:06.470
"multi-edges. In general if there are N
vertices",00:06:06.470,00:06:10.580
"then maximum number of edges in a
directed graph would be",00:06:10.580,00:06:14.699
"N * (N - 1), so in a simple",00:06:14.699,00:06:17.789
"directed graph of number of edges would be
in this range",00:06:17.789,00:06:21.699
"0 to N * (N-1). Now what do
you think would be the maximum for an",00:06:21.699,00:06:26.830
undirected graphs.,00:06:26.830,00:06:28.620
"In an undirected graph, we can have only
1 bi-directional",00:06:28.620,00:06:32.190
"edge between a pair of nodes. We can't
have 2 edges in different directions,",00:06:32.190,00:06:37.190
"so here the maximum would be half of
maximum for directed.",00:06:37.190,00:06:41.819
"So if the graph is simple and undirected
number of edges would be",00:06:41.819,00:06:46.199
in the range 0 to (N * (N - 1)) / 2.,00:06:46.199,00:06:50.310
"Remember this is true only if there is
no self loop or multi-edge.",00:06:50.310,00:06:54.819
"Now if you can see number of edges in
the graph can be really really large",00:06:54.819,00:06:58.680
compared to a number of vertices.,00:06:58.680,00:07:00.849
"For example if number of vertices in a
directed graph",00:07:00.849,00:07:04.819
"is equal to 10, maximum number of edges
would be",00:07:04.819,00:07:09.349
"90. If number of vertices is 100,",00:07:09.349,00:07:13.000
maximum number of edges would be 9900.,00:07:13.000,00:07:16.560
"Maximum number of edges would be close
to Square of number of vertices.",00:07:16.560,00:07:21.560
"A graph is called dense if number of
edges in the graph is close to maximum",00:07:21.560,00:07:26.069
possible number of edges,00:07:26.069,00:07:27.910
"that is if the number of edges is of
order of square of number of vertices,",00:07:27.910,00:07:32.840
"and a graph is called sparse if the
number of edges is really less",00:07:32.840,00:07:38.060
"typically close to a number of
vertices and not more than that.",00:07:38.060,00:07:42.110
"There is no defined boundary for what
can be called dense and what can be",00:07:42.110,00:07:45.300
called,00:07:45.300,00:07:45.740
sparse. It all depends on context,00:07:45.740,00:07:49.039
"but this is an important classification.
While working with graphs,",00:07:49.039,00:07:52.990
"a lot of decisions are made based on
whether the graph is",00:07:52.990,00:07:56.349
"dense or sparse. For example we
typically choose a different kind of",00:07:56.349,00:08:00.400
"storage structure in computer's memory
for a dense graph.",00:08:00.400,00:08:04.020
"We typically store a dense graphs and
something called adjacency matrix,",00:08:04.020,00:08:09.000
"and for a sparse graph we typically use
something called",00:08:09.000,00:08:12.580
"adjacency list. I'll be talking about
adjacency matrix and adjacency list in",00:08:12.580,00:08:18.780
"next lesson. Okay, now the next concept
that I want to talk about is concept",00:08:18.780,00:08:23.099
of,00:08:23.099,00:08:24.289
path in a graph. A path in a graph is,00:08:24.289,00:08:27.419
"a sequence of vertices where each 
adjacent",00:08:27.419,00:08:30.830
"pair in the sequence is connected by an
edge.",00:08:30.830,00:08:35.360
"I'm highlighting the path here in this
example graph. This sequence of vertices",00:08:35.360,00:08:39.419
A B F and H is a path in this graph.,00:08:39.419,00:08:43.130
"Now we have an undirected graph here,
edges are bi-directional.",00:08:43.130,00:08:47.060
"In a directed graph, all edges must also
be aligned",00:08:47.060,00:08:50.700
"in 1 direction the direction of the
path.",00:08:50.700,00:08:53.880
"A path is called simple path if no vertices
are repeated",00:08:53.880,00:08:59.080
"and if vertices are not repeated
then edges will also not be repeated.",00:08:59.080,00:09:03.769
"So in a simple path both vertices and
edges are not repeated.",00:09:03.769,00:09:07.769
"This path A B F H that I have highlighted
here",00:09:07.769,00:09:10.990
"is a simple path but we could also have
a path like",00:09:10.990,00:09:15.140
"this. Here, start vertex is A and",00:09:15.140,00:09:18.589
"end vertex is D. In this path,",00:09:18.589,00:09:21.810
1 edge and 2 vertices are repeated.,00:09:21.810,00:09:25.190
"In graph theory, there is some inconsistency
in use of this term path.",00:09:25.190,00:09:29.930
"Most of the time, when we say path
we mean a simple path",00:09:29.930,00:09:33.810
"and if repetition is possible we used
this term",00:09:33.810,00:09:37.589
walk. So a path is basically a walk,00:09:37.589,00:09:40.790
in which no vertices or edges are repeated.,00:09:40.790,00:09:44.980
"A walk is called a trail if 
vertices can be repeated",00:09:44.980,00:09:48.930
"but edges cannot be repeated. I'm highlighting
a trail here in this example graph.",00:09:48.930,00:09:54.519
"Okay, now I want to say this once again
walk and",00:09:54.519,00:09:57.810
"path are often used as synonyms but most
often when we say path",00:09:57.810,00:10:02.640
"we mean simple path, a path in which
vertices and edges",00:10:02.640,00:10:07.149
"are not repeated. Between 2 different
vertices if there is ",00:10:07.149,00:10:11.940
"a walk in which vertices or edges
are repeated",00:10:11.940,00:10:15.950
"like this walk that I'am showing you here in
this example graph",00:10:15.950,00:10:19.510
"then there must also be a path or simple
path",00:10:19.510,00:10:22.660
"that is a walk in which vertices or
edges",00:10:22.660,00:10:25.899
"would not be repeated. In this walk that
I'm showing you here, we're starting at",00:10:25.899,00:10:30.209
A and we are ending our walk at C.,00:10:30.209,00:10:33.500
"There is a simple path from A to C
with just 1 edge.",00:10:33.500,00:10:37.620
"All we need to do is, we need to avoid
going to B E H",00:10:37.620,00:10:41.670
"D and then coming back again to A. So
this is why we mostly talk about simple",00:10:41.670,00:10:46.660
path between 2 vertices,00:10:46.660,00:10:48.880
"because if any other walk is possible
simple path is also possible",00:10:48.880,00:10:52.529
"and it makes most sense to look for a
simple path",00:10:52.529,00:10:56.500
"so this is what I'm going to do
throughout our lessons. I'm going to say",00:10:56.500,00:11:00.209
"path and by path, I'll mean simple path",00:11:00.209,00:11:03.870
"and if it's not a simple path I'll say it
explicitly.",00:11:03.870,00:11:07.800
"A graph is called strongly connected if
in the graph",00:11:07.800,00:11:11.130
"there is a path from any vertex to any
other vertex.",00:11:11.130,00:11:15.550
"If it's an undirected graphs, we simply
call it connected",00:11:15.550,00:11:19.310
"and if it's a directed graph, we call it
strongly connected.",00:11:19.310,00:11:24.589
"In leftmost and rightmost graphs that I'm
showing you here,",00:11:24.589,00:11:27.980
"we have a path from any vertex to any
other vertex",00:11:27.980,00:11:31.470
"but in this graph in the middle, we do
not have a path from",00:11:31.470,00:11:34.720
"any vertex to any other vertex. We cannot
go from vertex C to",00:11:34.720,00:11:39.010
"A. We can go from A to C but we
cannot go from",00:11:39.010,00:11:42.220
"C to A, So this is not a strongly
connected graph.",00:11:42.220,00:11:47.279
"Remember if it's an undirected graph, we
simply say connected and if it's",00:11:47.279,00:11:51.470
"a directed graph we say a strongly
connected. If a directed graph is not",00:11:51.470,00:11:55.800
strongly connected,00:11:55.800,00:11:57.180
"but can be turned into connected
graph",00:11:57.180,00:12:00.490
by treating all edges as undirected,00:12:00.490,00:12:03.639
"then such a directed graph is called
weakly connected.",00:12:03.639,00:12:07.769
"If we just ignore the directions of
edges here, this is connected",00:12:07.769,00:12:12.019
"but I would recommend that you just
remember connected and strongly",00:12:12.019,00:12:15.470
connected.,00:12:15.470,00:12:16.680
This leftmost undirected graph is connected.,00:12:16.680,00:12:20.360
"I removed 1 of the edges and now this
is not connected.",00:12:20.360,00:12:23.889
"Now we have 2 disjoint connected
components here",00:12:23.889,00:12:27.570
"but the graph overall is not
connected.",00:12:27.570,00:12:30.579
"Connectedness of a graph is are really
important property.",00:12:30.579,00:12:33.899
"If you remember, intracity road
network with a city",00:12:33.899,00:12:38.089
"that would have a lot of 1 ways can
be present as a directed graph.",00:12:38.089,00:12:43.389
"Now an intra-city road network should
always be strongly connected.",00:12:43.389,00:12:47.820
"We should be able to reach any street
from any street,",00:12:47.820,00:12:52.029
"any intersection to any intersection.
Okay, now that we understand concept of",00:12:52.029,00:12:56.170
path.,00:12:56.170,00:12:57.600
"Next, I want to talk about cycle in a
graph.",00:12:57.600,00:13:01.200
A walk is called a closed walk if,00:13:01.200,00:13:04.310
it starts an ends at same vertex,00:13:04.310,00:13:07.430
"like what i'm showing here and there is 1
more condition,",00:13:07.430,00:13:11.100
"the length of the walk must be
greater than 0.",00:13:11.100,00:13:14.740
"Length of a walk or path is number of edges
in the path",00:13:14.740,00:13:19.350
"like for this closed walk that I'm showing
you here.",00:13:19.350,00:13:22.810
"length is 5 because we have 5 edges
in this walk.",00:13:22.810,00:13:26.370
"So a closed walk is a walk that starts
and ends at same vertex",00:13:26.370,00:13:31.260
"and the length of which is greater than
0. Now some may call",00:13:31.260,00:13:35.510
"closed walk a cycle but generally we used
the term cycle",00:13:35.510,00:13:40.139
for a simple cycle. A simple cycle is,00:13:40.139,00:13:44.110
"a close walk in which other than start
and",00:13:44.110,00:13:47.660
"end vertices no other vertex or
edge",00:13:47.660,00:13:50.790
"is repeated. Right now, what I'm showing
you here in this example graphs is",00:13:50.790,00:13:54.880
a simple cycle or we can just say cycle.,00:13:54.880,00:13:58.690
"A graph with no cycle is called an
acyclic graph.",00:13:58.690,00:14:02.800
"A tree if drawn with undirected edges would
be an example of",00:14:02.800,00:14:07.380
"and undirected acyclic graphs. Here
in this tree,",00:14:07.380,00:14:11.300
"we can have a closed walk but we
cannot have a simple cycle.",00:14:11.300,00:14:16.540
"In this closed walk that I'm showing you
here, our edge is repeated.",00:14:16.540,00:14:20.820
"There would be no simple cycle in a tree
and apart from tree,",00:14:20.820,00:14:24.850
"we can have other kind of undirected
acyclic graphs also.",00:14:24.850,00:14:28.860
"A tree also has to be connected. Now we
can also have",00:14:28.860,00:14:32.050
"a directed acyclic graph,",00:14:32.050,00:14:35.589
"as you can see here also we do not have
any cycle.",00:14:35.589,00:14:38.750
"You cannot have a path of lenght greater
than 0 starting and ending at the same",00:14:38.750,00:14:42.880
vertex.,00:14:42.880,00:14:44.199
"A directed cyclic graph is often
called",00:14:44.199,00:14:47.540
"a DAG. A cycles in a graph cause a lot of
issues",00:14:47.540,00:14:52.180
"in designing algorithms for
problems like finding shortest route",00:14:52.180,00:14:56.440
from 1 vertex to another,00:14:56.440,00:14:58.480
"and we will talk about cycles a lot when
we will study some of these advanced",00:14:58.480,00:15:02.500
algorithm in coming lessons.,00:15:02.500,00:15:04.449
"For this lesson, I'll stop here now.
In our next lesson, we will discuss",00:15:04.449,00:15:08.699
"ways of creating and storing graph in
computers memory.",00:15:08.699,00:15:12.860
"This is it for this lesson. Thanks for
watching.",00:15:12.860,00:15:15.180
