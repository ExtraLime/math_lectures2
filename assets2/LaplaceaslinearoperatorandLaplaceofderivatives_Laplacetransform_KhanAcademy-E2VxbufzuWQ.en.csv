"Well, now's as good a time
as any to go over some",00:00:00.680,00:00:03.540
"interesting and very
useful properties",00:00:03.540,00:00:06.670
of the Laplace transform.,00:00:06.670,00:00:07.670
"And the first is to show that
it is a linear operator.",00:00:07.670,00:00:10.620
And what does that mean?,00:00:10.620,00:00:11.230
"Well, let's say I wanted to take
the Laplace transform of",00:00:11.230,00:00:17.840
the sum of the-- we call it the,00:00:17.840,00:00:19.270
weighted sum of two functions.,00:00:19.270,00:00:20.590
"So say some constant, c1, times
my first function, f of",00:00:20.590,00:00:25.222
"t, plus some constant,
c2, times my second",00:00:25.222,00:00:30.600
"function, g of t.",00:00:30.600,00:00:31.850
"Well, by the definition of the
Laplace transform, this would",00:00:34.560,00:00:38.590
"be equal to the improper
integral from 0 to infinity of",00:00:38.590,00:00:45.280
"e to the minus st, times
whatever our function that",00:00:45.280,00:00:51.810
"we're taking the Laplace
transform of, so times c1, f",00:00:51.810,00:00:56.220
"of t, plus c2, g of t-- I think
you know where this is",00:00:56.220,00:01:01.480
going-- all of that dt.,00:01:01.480,00:01:04.410
"And then that is equal to the
integral from 0 to infinity.",00:01:04.410,00:01:09.820
"Let's just distribute
the e the minus st.",00:01:09.820,00:01:12.780
That is equal to what?,00:01:12.780,00:01:15.350
"That is equal to c1e to the
minus st, f of t, plus c2e to",00:01:15.350,00:01:29.955
"the minus st, g of t, and
all of that times dt.",00:01:29.955,00:01:38.560
"And just by the definition
of how the properties of",00:01:38.560,00:01:42.220
"integrals work, we know that we
can split this up into two",00:01:42.220,00:01:44.520
"integrals, right?",00:01:44.520,00:01:45.650
"If the integral of the sum of
two functions is equal to the",00:01:45.650,00:01:49.170
sum of their integrals.,00:01:49.170,00:01:50.580
And these are just constant.,00:01:50.580,00:01:51.860
"So this is going to be equal to
c1 times the integral from",00:01:51.860,00:01:57.190
"0 to infinity of e to the minus
st, times f of t, d of",00:01:57.190,00:02:04.860
"t, plus c2 times the integral
from 0 to infinity of e to the",00:02:04.860,00:02:12.960
"minus st, g of t, dt.",00:02:12.960,00:02:17.840
"And this was just a very
long-winded way of saying,",00:02:17.840,00:02:21.880
what is this?,00:02:21.880,00:02:22.410
"This is the Laplace transform
of f of t.",00:02:22.410,00:02:24.410
"This is the Laplace transform
of g of t.",00:02:24.410,00:02:26.060
"So this is equal to c1 times the
Laplace transform of f of",00:02:26.060,00:02:32.550
"t, plus c2 times-- this is the
Laplace transform-- the",00:02:32.550,00:02:40.430
Laplace transform of g of t.,00:02:40.430,00:02:45.110
"And so, we have just shown that
the Laplace transform is",00:02:45.110,00:02:48.730
"a linear operator, right?",00:02:48.730,00:02:50.210
"The Laplace transform of
this is equal to this.",00:02:50.210,00:02:53.030
"So essentially, you can kind of
break up the sum and take",00:02:53.030,00:02:57.310
"out the constants, and just take
the Laplace transform.",00:02:57.310,00:02:59.830
"That's something useful to
know, and you might have",00:02:59.830,00:03:01.720
"guessed that was the
case anyway.",00:03:01.720,00:03:03.260
But now you know for sure.,00:03:03.260,00:03:05.150
"Now we'll do something which
I consider even more",00:03:05.150,00:03:08.640
interesting.,00:03:08.640,00:03:09.420
"And this is actually going to
be a big clue as to why",00:03:09.420,00:03:12.730
"Laplace transforms are extremely
useful for solving",00:03:12.730,00:03:17.360
differential equations.,00:03:17.360,00:03:19.020
"So let's say I want to find
the Laplace transform of f",00:03:19.020,00:03:26.120
prime of t.,00:03:26.120,00:03:28.380
"So I have some f of t, I take
its derivative, and then I",00:03:28.380,00:03:31.050
"want the Laplace transform
of that.",00:03:31.050,00:03:33.100
"Let's see if we can find a
relationship between the",00:03:33.100,00:03:35.440
"Laplace transform of the
derivative of a function, and",00:03:35.440,00:03:37.840
"the Laplace transform
of the function.",00:03:37.840,00:03:40.950
"So we're going to use some
integration by parts here.",00:03:40.950,00:03:44.180
"Let me just say what this
is, first of all.",00:03:46.700,00:03:48.000
"This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity of e to the",00:03:48.000,00:03:55.360
"minus st, times f
prime of t, dt.",00:03:55.360,00:04:03.390
"And to solve this, we're going
to use integration by parts.",00:04:03.390,00:04:05.940
"Let me write it in the
corner, just so you",00:04:05.940,00:04:07.492
remember what it is.,00:04:07.492,00:04:08.180
"So I think I memorized it,
because I recorded that last",00:04:08.180,00:04:11.200
video not too long ago.,00:04:11.200,00:04:13.305
"I'm just going to write
this shorthand.",00:04:13.305,00:04:14.200
"The integral of u-- well, let's
say uv prime, because",00:04:14.200,00:04:20.149
"that will match what we have up
here better-- is equal to",00:04:20.149,00:04:25.390
"both functions without the
derivitives, uv minus the",00:04:25.390,00:04:29.790
integral of the opposite.,00:04:29.790,00:04:30.940
So the opposite is u prime v.,00:04:30.940,00:04:32.720
"So here, the substitution
is pretty clear, right?",00:04:35.550,00:04:38.550
"Because we want to end up
with f of x, right?",00:04:38.550,00:04:43.460
"So let's make v prime is f
prime, and let's make u e to",00:04:43.460,00:04:46.880
"the minus st. So
let's do that.",00:04:46.880,00:04:49.170
"u is going to be e to the minus
st, and v is going to",00:04:49.170,00:04:58.140
equal what?,00:04:58.140,00:04:59.910
"v is going to equal
f prime of t.",00:04:59.910,00:05:05.150
"And then u prime would be minus
se to the minus st. And",00:05:05.150,00:05:14.070
"then, v prime-- oh, sorry,
this is v prime, right?",00:05:14.070,00:05:21.700
"v prime is f prime of t, so
v is just going to be",00:05:21.700,00:05:26.620
equal to f of t.,00:05:26.620,00:05:27.720
"I hope I didn't say that
wrong the first time.",00:05:27.720,00:05:30.090
But you see what I'm saying.,00:05:30.090,00:05:31.270
"This is u, that's u, and
this is v prime.",00:05:31.270,00:05:37.650
"And if this is v prime, then
if you were to take the",00:05:37.650,00:05:39.320
"antiderivative of both sides,
then v is equal to f of t.",00:05:39.320,00:05:42.070
"So let's apply integration
by parts.",00:05:42.070,00:05:45.490
"So this Laplace transform, which
is this, is equal to uv,",00:05:45.490,00:05:51.030
"which is equal to e to the minus
st, times v, f of t,",00:05:51.030,00:06:01.470
"minus the integral-- and, of
course, we're going to have to",00:06:01.470,00:06:08.150
"evaluate this from
0 to infinity.",00:06:08.150,00:06:10.570
"I'll keep the improper
integral with",00:06:10.570,00:06:15.220
us the whole time.,00:06:15.220,00:06:15.960
"I won't switch back and forth
between the definite and",00:06:15.960,00:06:19.380
indefinite integral.,00:06:19.380,00:06:20.310
So minus this part.,00:06:20.310,00:06:22.590
"So the integral from 0 to
infinity of u prime.",00:06:22.590,00:06:28.650
"u prime is minus se to the
minus st times v--",00:06:28.650,00:06:36.640
v is f of t-- dt.,00:06:36.640,00:06:43.590
"Now, let's see.",00:06:43.590,00:06:43.790
"We have a minus and a
minus, let's make",00:06:43.790,00:06:45.275
both of these pluses.,00:06:45.275,00:06:47.390
"This s is just a constant,
so we can bring it out.",00:06:47.390,00:06:49.580
"So that is equal to e to the
minus st, f of t, evaluated",00:06:49.580,00:07:02.150
"from 0 to infinity, or as we
approach infinity, plus s",00:07:02.150,00:07:07.550
"times the integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus st,",00:07:07.550,00:07:13.890
"f of t, dt.",00:07:13.890,00:07:17.110
"And here, we see,
what is this?",00:07:17.110,00:07:19.070
"This is the Laplace transform
of f of t, right?",00:07:19.070,00:07:22.230
Let's evaluate this part.,00:07:25.430,00:07:27.010
"So when we evaluated in
infinity, as we approach",00:07:27.010,00:07:29.310
"infinity, e to the minus
infinity approaches 0.",00:07:29.310,00:07:34.350
"f of infinity-- now this is
an interesting question.",00:07:34.350,00:07:38.960
f of infinity-- I don't know.,00:07:38.960,00:07:40.180
"That could be large, that
could be small, that",00:07:40.180,00:07:43.570
"approaches some value, right?",00:07:43.570,00:07:46.400
"This approach 0, so
we're not sure.",00:07:46.400,00:07:48.000
"If this increases faster than
this approaches 0, then this",00:07:48.000,00:07:51.970
will diverge.,00:07:51.970,00:07:53.240
"I won't go into the mathematics
of whether this",00:07:53.240,00:07:55.920
"converges or diverges, but let's
just say, in very rough",00:07:55.920,00:07:59.180
"terms, that this will converge
to 0 if f of t grows slower",00:07:59.180,00:08:05.030
"than e to the minus
st shrinks.",00:08:05.030,00:08:08.000
"And maybe later on we'll do some
more rigorous definitions",00:08:08.000,00:08:11.940
"of under what conditions
will this",00:08:11.940,00:08:16.300
expression actually converge.,00:08:16.300,00:08:17.810
"But let's assume that f of t
grows slower than e to the st,",00:08:17.810,00:08:23.290
"or it diverges slower than this
converges, is another way",00:08:23.290,00:08:31.310
to view it.,00:08:31.310,00:08:31.910
"Or this grows slower
than this shrinks.",00:08:31.910,00:08:35.070
"So if this grows slower than
this shrinks, then this whole",00:08:35.070,00:08:37.730
expression will approach 0.,00:08:37.730,00:08:41.320
"And then you want to subtract
this whole expression",00:08:41.320,00:08:43.730
evaluated at 0.,00:08:43.730,00:08:45.180
"So e to the 0 is 1 times f of
0-- so that's just f of 0--",00:08:45.180,00:08:52.805
"plus s times-- we said, this is
the Laplace transform of f",00:08:52.805,00:08:57.030
"of t, that's our definition--
so the Laplace",00:08:57.030,00:08:58.810
transform of f of t.,00:08:58.810,00:09:05.580
"And now we have an interesting
property.",00:09:05.580,00:09:07.120
"What was the left-hand side of
everything we were doing?",00:09:07.120,00:09:09.030
"The Laplace transform
of f prime of t.",00:09:09.030,00:09:11.740
"So let me just write
all over again.",00:09:11.740,00:09:14.860
And I'll switch colors.,00:09:14.860,00:09:15.850
"The Laplace transform of f prime
of t is equal to s times",00:09:15.850,00:09:25.710
"the Laplace transform of
f of t minus f of 0.",00:09:25.710,00:09:36.740
"And now, let's just extend
this further.",00:09:36.740,00:09:39.480
"What is the Laplace transform--
and this is a",00:09:39.480,00:09:41.090
"really useful thing to know--
what is the Laplace transform",00:09:41.090,00:09:44.800
of f prime prime of t?,00:09:44.800,00:09:49.030
"Well, we can do a little pattern
matching here, right?",00:09:49.030,00:09:51.270
"That's going to be s times the
Laplace transform of its",00:09:51.270,00:09:54.960
"antiderivative, times the
Laplace transform of f prime",00:09:54.960,00:09:59.000
"of t, right?",00:09:59.000,00:10:02.750
"This goes to this, that's
an antiderivative.",00:10:02.750,00:10:04.020
"This goes to this, that's
one antiderivative.",00:10:04.020,00:10:07.800
"Minus f prime of 0, right?",00:10:07.800,00:10:13.520
"But then what's the Laplace
transform of this?",00:10:13.520,00:10:16.780
"This is going to be equal to s
times the Laplace transform of",00:10:16.780,00:10:21.720
"f prime of t, but what's that?",00:10:21.720,00:10:23.660
"That's this, right?",00:10:23.660,00:10:26.560
"That's s times the Laplace
transform of f of t, minus f",00:10:26.560,00:10:35.550
"of 0, right?",00:10:35.550,00:10:38.270
"I just substituted
this with this.",00:10:38.270,00:10:40.360
Minus f prime of 0.,00:10:40.360,00:10:44.750

of the second",00:10:44.750,00:10:47.380

to see a pattern here.",00:11:04.430,00:11:05.840
"This is the Laplace transform
of f prime prime of t.",00:11:05.840,00:11:10.530
"And I think you're starting
to see why the Laplace",00:11:10.530,00:11:12.240
transform is useful.,00:11:12.240,00:11:13.390
"It turns derivatives into
multiplications by f.",00:11:13.390,00:11:17.910
"And actually, as you'll see
later, it turns integration to",00:11:17.910,00:11:20.510
divisions by s.,00:11:20.510,00:11:22.330
"And you can take arbitrary

multiplying by s.,00:11:26.070,00:11:27.290
And you see this pattern.,00:11:27.290,00:11:28.000
And I'm running out of time.,00:11:28.000,00:11:29.610

figure out what the Laplace",00:11:29.610,00:11:31.310
