"OK, I filled your brain with a
bunch of partial derivatives",00:00:00.590,00:00:03.600
"and psi's, with respect
to x's and y's.",00:00:03.600,00:00:05.920
"I think now it's time to
actually do it with a real",00:00:05.920,00:00:09.820
"differential equation,
and make things a",00:00:09.820,00:00:11.400
little bit more concrete.,00:00:11.400,00:00:12.195
"So let's say I have the
differential, y, the",00:00:12.195,00:00:16.640
"differential equation, y cosine
of x, plus 2xe to the",00:00:16.640,00:00:24.570
"y, plus sine of x, plus-- I'm
already running out of space--",00:00:24.570,00:00:34.360
"x squared, e to the y,
minus 1, times y",00:00:34.360,00:00:40.140
"prime, is equal to 0.",00:00:40.140,00:00:42.970
"Well, your brain is already,
hopefully, in exact",00:00:42.970,00:00:46.090
differential equations mode.,00:00:46.090,00:00:47.310
"But if you were to see this
pattern in general, where you",00:00:47.310,00:00:49.510
"see a function of x and y,
here-- this is just some",00:00:49.510,00:00:53.690
"function of x and y-- and then
you have another function of x",00:00:53.690,00:00:56.870
"and y, times y prime, or times
dy, d of x, your brain should",00:00:56.870,00:01:00.440
"immediately say if this
is inseparable.",00:01:00.440,00:01:01.950
"And I'm not going to try to
make it separable, just",00:01:01.950,00:01:04.180
"because that'll take
a lot of time.",00:01:04.180,00:01:05.530
"But if it's not separable, your
brain said, oh, maybe",00:01:05.530,00:01:07.460
this is an exact equation.,00:01:07.460,00:01:08.850
"And, you say, let
me test whether",00:01:08.850,00:01:11.350
this is an exact equation.,00:01:11.350,00:01:13.040
"So if this is an exact equation,
this is our function",00:01:13.040,00:01:16.300
"M, which is a function
of x and y.",00:01:16.300,00:01:19.160
"And this is our function
N, which is a",00:01:19.160,00:01:21.670
function of x and y.,00:01:21.670,00:01:23.140
"Now, the test is to see if the
partial of this, with respect",00:01:23.140,00:01:25.700
"to y, is equal to the partial
of this, with respect to x.",00:01:25.700,00:01:30.290
So let's see.,00:01:30.290,00:01:31.420
"The partial of M, with respect
to y, is equal to-- let's see,",00:01:31.420,00:01:36.240
"y is-- so this cosine of x is
just a constant, so it's just",00:01:36.240,00:01:39.480
cosine of x.,00:01:39.480,00:01:42.460
"Cosine of x plus-- now,
what's the derivative?",00:01:42.460,00:01:47.610
"Well, 2x is just a constant,
what's the derivative of e to",00:01:47.610,00:01:49.725
"the y, with respect to y?",00:01:49.725,00:01:50.820
"Well, it's just e
to the y, right?",00:01:50.820,00:01:53.350
"So we have the constant on
the outside, 2x times the",00:01:53.350,00:01:56.110
"derivative, with respect to
y, so it's 2xe to the y.",00:01:56.110,00:01:58.810
Fair enough.,00:01:58.810,00:01:59.910
"Now, what is the partial
derivative of this, with",00:01:59.910,00:02:01.430
respect to x?,00:02:01.430,00:02:02.950
"So N sub x, or the partial of
N, with respect to x-- so",00:02:02.950,00:02:09.100
"what's the derivative of sine
of x, with respect to x?",00:02:09.100,00:02:11.360
"Well, that's easy, that's cosine
of x, plus 2x times e",00:02:11.360,00:02:17.630
"to the y, right? e and y is just
a constant, because y is",00:02:17.630,00:02:19.830
"constant when we're taking the
partial, with respect to x.",00:02:19.830,00:02:22.030
So plus 2xe to the y.,00:02:22.030,00:02:26.550
"And then minus 1, the derivative
of a constant, with",00:02:26.550,00:02:28.800
"respect to anything
is going to be 0.",00:02:28.800,00:02:31.450
"So the derivative of N-- the
partial of N, with respect to",00:02:31.450,00:02:34.310
"x, is cosine of x, plus 2xe to
the y, which, lo and behold,",00:02:34.310,00:02:38.460
"is the same thing as the
derivative, the partial of M,",00:02:38.460,00:02:41.000
with respect to y.,00:02:41.000,00:02:43.120
So there we have it.,00:02:43.120,00:02:44.190
"We've shown that M of y is equal
to-- or the partial of",00:02:44.190,00:02:48.860
"M, with respect to y-- is equal
to the partial of N,",00:02:48.860,00:02:52.230
"with respect to x, which
tells us that",00:02:52.230,00:02:55.510
this is an exact equation.,00:02:55.510,00:02:59.040
"Now, given that this is an exact
equation-- oh, my wife",00:02:59.040,00:03:06.380
"snuck up behind me,
I was wondering.",00:03:06.380,00:03:08.120
"I thought there was
some critter in",00:03:08.120,00:03:09.150
"my house, or something.",00:03:09.150,00:03:09.820
"Anyway, so we know that this is
an exact equation, so what",00:03:09.820,00:03:13.440
does that tell us?,00:03:13.440,00:03:14.020
"Well, that tells us that there's
some psi, where the",00:03:14.020,00:03:17.990
"partial derivative of psi, with
respect to x, is equal to",00:03:17.990,00:03:22.060
"M, and the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to y, is",00:03:22.060,00:03:26.420
equal to N.,00:03:26.420,00:03:27.600
"And if we know that psi,
then we can rewrite our",00:03:27.600,00:03:30.800
"differential equation as the
derivative of psi, with",00:03:30.800,00:03:35.090
"respect to x, is equal to 0.",00:03:35.090,00:03:38.450
So let's solve for psi.,00:03:38.450,00:03:40.790
"So we know that the partial of
psi, with respect to x, is",00:03:40.790,00:03:43.765
equal to M.,00:03:43.765,00:03:44.390
So we could write that.,00:03:44.390,00:03:45.160
"We could write the partial of
psi, with respect to x, is",00:03:45.160,00:03:50.820
"equal to M, which is y cosine
of x, plus 2xe to the y.",00:03:50.820,00:04:01.110
That's just here.,00:04:01.110,00:04:01.600
That's my M of x.,00:04:01.600,00:04:02.570
"We could have done
it the other way.",00:04:02.570,00:04:03.440
"We could have said the partial
of y-- the partial of psi,",00:04:03.440,00:04:06.160
"with respect to y, is this
thing over here.",00:04:06.160,00:04:08.220
But let's just do it with x.,00:04:08.220,00:04:10.430
"Now, to at least get kind of a
first approximation of what",00:04:10.430,00:04:14.910
"size-- not an approximation, but
to start to get a sense of",00:04:14.910,00:04:16.930
"it-- let's take the derivative
of both sides, with respect",00:04:16.930,00:04:19.829
"to-- sorry, take the
antiderivative-- take the",00:04:19.829,00:04:22.000
"integral of both sides,
with respect to x.",00:04:22.000,00:04:25.270
"So if you take the derivative of
this, with respect to x, if",00:04:25.270,00:04:28.280
"you integrate-- sorry, if
you were to take the",00:04:28.280,00:04:30.800
"antiderivative of this,
with respect to x.",00:04:30.800,00:04:34.220
"So let me just write
that down.",00:04:34.220,00:04:36.836
"The partial, with
respect to x.",00:04:36.836,00:04:38.520
We're going to [? integrate ?],00:04:38.520,00:04:39.360
"it, with respect to x.",00:04:39.360,00:04:40.820
"That is going to be equal to
the integral of this whole",00:04:40.820,00:04:45.030
"thing, with respect to x.",00:04:45.030,00:04:46.820
Cosine of x plus 2xe to the y.,00:04:46.820,00:04:51.940
"We're integrating with
respect to x.",00:04:51.940,00:04:53.870
"And normally when you integrate
with respect to x,",00:04:53.870,00:04:57.220
"you'd say, OK, plus c, right?",00:04:57.220,00:04:59.430
"But it actually could be a
plus-- since this is a",00:04:59.430,00:05:03.000
"partial, with respect to x, we
could have had some function",00:05:03.000,00:05:05.740
"of y here in general, because
y, we treat it",00:05:05.740,00:05:09.045
"as a constant, right?",00:05:09.045,00:05:10.730
"And that makes sense, because
if you were to take the",00:05:10.730,00:05:12.300
"partial of both sides of this,
with respect to x, if you were",00:05:12.300,00:05:15.110
"to take the partial of a
function that is only a",00:05:15.110,00:05:17.430
"function of y, with respect
to x, you would",00:05:17.430,00:05:19.420
have gotten a 0 here.,00:05:19.420,00:05:20.880
"So when you take the
antiderivative, you were,",00:05:20.880,00:05:22.200
"like, oh well, there might have
been some function of y",00:05:22.200,00:05:24.190
"here that we lost when
we took the partial,",00:05:24.190,00:05:26.780
with respect to x.,00:05:26.780,00:05:28.790
"So anyway, this will
simplify to psi.",00:05:28.790,00:05:34.690
"psi is going to be equal to the
integral, with respect to",00:05:34.690,00:05:37.710
"x, or the antiderivative, with
respect to x, here, plus some",00:05:37.710,00:05:40.340
"function of y that we might
have lost when we took the",00:05:40.340,00:05:44.130
"partial, with respect to x.",00:05:44.130,00:05:46.520
So let's do that.,00:05:46.520,00:05:47.260
"Let's figure out
this integral.",00:05:47.260,00:05:49.260
"I'll do it in blue So y
is just a constant.",00:05:49.260,00:05:52.890
"So the antiderivative of y
cosine of x, is just y sine of",00:05:52.890,00:05:57.310
"x, plus-- either the y
is constant, so 2x.",00:05:57.310,00:06:04.020
"The antiderivative of 2x, with
respect to x, is x squared, so",00:06:04.020,00:06:06.060
it's x squared e to the y.,00:06:06.060,00:06:10.920
"And then plus some
function of y.",00:06:10.920,00:06:18.440
"And if you want to verify this,
you should take the",00:06:18.440,00:06:20.540
"partial of this, with
respect to x.",00:06:20.540,00:06:22.080
"If you take the partial of
this, with respect to x,",00:06:22.080,00:06:24.200
"you're going to get this in
here, which is our function,",00:06:24.200,00:06:27.780
"M, up here.",00:06:27.780,00:06:30.310
"And then when you take the
partial of this, with respect",00:06:30.310,00:06:32.190
"to x, you'll get 0, and
it'll get lost. OK, so",00:06:32.190,00:06:34.720
we're almost there.,00:06:34.720,00:06:35.430
"We've almost figured out our
psi, but we still need to",00:06:35.430,00:06:38.270
figure out this function of y.,00:06:38.270,00:06:42.030
"Well, we know that if we take
the partial of this, with",00:06:42.030,00:06:43.880
"respect to y, since this
is an exact equation,",00:06:43.880,00:06:47.340
we should get this.,00:06:47.340,00:06:48.210
We should get our N function.,00:06:48.210,00:06:49.410
So let's do that.,00:06:49.410,00:06:51.150
"So the partial-- I'll switch
notation, just to expose you",00:06:51.150,00:06:55.540
"to it-- the partial psi, with
respect to y, is going to be",00:06:55.540,00:06:58.340
"equal to-- so here, y sine
of x, sine of x is just a",00:06:58.340,00:07:02.160
"constant. y is just y, so the
derivative of this, with",00:07:02.160,00:07:04.420
"respect to y, is
just sine of x.",00:07:04.420,00:07:06.030
"Plus the derivative of e to the
y is e to the y. x squared",00:07:08.920,00:07:12.300
is just a constant.,00:07:12.300,00:07:12.950
"So it's just x squared e to
the y, plus-- what's the",00:07:12.950,00:07:18.600
"partial of f of y, with
respect to y?",00:07:18.600,00:07:21.120
It's going to be f prime of y.,00:07:21.120,00:07:26.900
"Well, what did we do?",00:07:26.900,00:07:27.530
"We took M, we integrated with
respect to x, and we said,",00:07:27.530,00:07:31.230
"well, we might have lost some
function of y, so we added",00:07:31.230,00:07:33.270
that to it.,00:07:33.270,00:07:34.060
"And then we took the partial of
that side that we've almost",00:07:34.060,00:07:37.740
"constructed, and we took
the partial of that,",00:07:37.740,00:07:40.470
with respect to y.,00:07:40.470,00:07:42.040
"Now, we know, since this is
exact, that that is going to",00:07:42.040,00:07:44.940
equal our N.,00:07:44.940,00:07:46.960
So our N is up there.,00:07:46.960,00:07:48.670
"Cosine of x plus-- So that's
going to be equal to-- I want",00:07:48.670,00:07:52.585
"to make sure I can read it up
there-- to our N, right?",00:07:52.585,00:07:57.720
"Oh no, sorry.",00:07:57.720,00:07:58.390
N is up here.,00:07:58.390,00:07:59.930
Our N is up here.,00:07:59.930,00:08:00.540
"Sine of x-- let me write
that-- sine of x plus x",00:08:00.540,00:08:03.150
"squared, e to the y, minus 1.",00:08:03.150,00:08:05.450
"So sine of x plus x squared,
e to the y, minus 1.",00:08:05.450,00:08:13.760
"That was just our N,
from our original",00:08:17.820,00:08:19.350
differential equation.,00:08:19.350,00:08:21.470
"And now we can solve
for f prime of y.",00:08:21.470,00:08:23.720
"So let's see, we get sine of x
plus x squared, e to the y,",00:08:23.720,00:08:31.010
"plus f prime of y, is equal to
sine of x plus x squared, e to",00:08:31.010,00:08:39.364
"the y, minus 1.",00:08:39.364,00:08:42.150
"So let's see, we can delete
sine of x from both sides.",00:08:42.150,00:08:45.600
"We can delete x squared e to
the y from both sides.",00:08:45.600,00:08:48.640
"And then what are
we left with?",00:08:48.640,00:08:49.740
"We're left with f prime
of y is equal to 1.",00:08:49.740,00:08:55.750
"And then we're left with f of
y is equal to-- well, it",00:08:55.750,00:09:03.610
"equals y plus some constant,
c, right?",00:09:03.610,00:09:11.720
So what is our psi now?,00:09:11.720,00:09:14.350
"We wrote our psi up here, and we
had this f of y here, so we",00:09:14.350,00:09:17.040
can rewrite it now.,00:09:17.040,00:09:17.600
"So psi is a function of x and
y-- we're actually pretty much",00:09:17.600,00:09:20.640
"almost done solving it-- psi
is a function of x and y is",00:09:20.640,00:09:24.240
"equal to y sine of x, plus x
squared, e to the y, plus y--",00:09:24.240,00:09:41.010
"oh, sorry, this is f prime
of y, minus 1.",00:09:41.010,00:09:42.860
So this is a minus 1.,00:09:42.860,00:09:44.330
So this is a minus y plus c.,00:09:44.330,00:09:46.350
"So this is going to be
a minus y plus c.",00:09:46.350,00:09:49.370
So we've solved for psi.,00:09:49.370,00:09:51.560
And so what does that tell us?,00:09:51.560,00:09:52.800
"Well, we said that original
differential equation, up",00:09:52.800,00:09:55.390
"here, using the partial
derivative chain rule, that",00:09:55.390,00:09:59.390
"original differential equation,
can be rewritten now",00:09:59.390,00:10:03.270
"as the derivative dx of psi is
equal to-- psi is a function",00:10:03.270,00:10:10.740
of x and y-- is equal to 0.,00:10:10.740,00:10:14.570
"Or if you were to integrate both
sides of this, you would",00:10:14.570,00:10:17.560
"get that psi of xy is equal
to c is a solution of that",00:10:17.560,00:10:26.630
differential equation.,00:10:26.630,00:10:27.430
"So if we were to set this is
equal to c, that's the",00:10:27.430,00:10:30.020
differential equation.,00:10:30.020,00:10:30.700
"So we could say, y sine of x
plus x squared, e to the y,",00:10:30.700,00:10:37.530
"minus y-- now we could say, plus
this c-- plus this c, you",00:10:37.530,00:10:42.890
"call it c1, is equal to c2.",00:10:42.890,00:10:44.990
"Well, you could subtract the c's
from both sides, and just",00:10:44.990,00:10:47.143
be left with a c at the end.,00:10:47.143,00:10:48.520
"But anyway, we have solved
this exact equation, one,",00:10:48.520,00:10:53.380
"first, by recognizing it was
exact, by taking the partial",00:10:53.380,00:10:57.220
"of this, with respect to y, and
seeing if that was equal",00:10:57.220,00:11:01.670
"to the partial of N,
with respect to x.",00:11:01.670,00:11:04.110
"Once we saw that they were
equal, we're like, OK, this is",00:11:04.110,00:11:07.000
going to be exact.,00:11:07.000,00:11:08.090
So let's figure out psi.,00:11:08.090,00:11:09.850
"Since this is exact, M is going
to be the partial of",00:11:09.850,00:11:13.340
"psi, with respect to x.",00:11:13.340,00:11:15.000
"N is the partial of psi,
with respect to y.",00:11:15.000,00:11:17.700
"Then to figure out y, we
integrated M, with respect to",00:11:17.700,00:11:21.570
"x, and we got this.",00:11:21.570,00:11:25.130
"But since we said, oh, well,
instead of a plus c, it could",00:11:25.130,00:11:27.500
"have been a function of y there,
because we took the",00:11:27.500,00:11:29.520
"partial, with respect to x, so
this might have been lost. To",00:11:29.520,00:11:32.140
"figure out the function of y,
we then took our psi that we",00:11:32.140,00:11:36.100
"figured out, took the partial
of that, with",00:11:36.100,00:11:37.960
"respect to y, got this.",00:11:37.960,00:11:40.290
"And we said, this was an exact
equation, so this is going to",00:11:40.290,00:11:42.450
equal our N of x y.,00:11:42.450,00:11:45.710
"We set those equal to each
other, and then we",00:11:45.710,00:11:47.750
solved for f of y.,00:11:47.750,00:11:50.420
And then we had our final psi.,00:11:50.420,00:11:52.690
Our final psi was this.,00:11:52.690,00:11:54.320
"And then the differential
equation, because of the chain",00:11:54.320,00:11:58.500
"rule of partial derivatives,
we could rewrite the",00:11:58.500,00:12:01.270
differential equation as this.,00:12:01.270,00:12:02.330
"The solution is this, and so
this is the solution to our",00:12:02.330,00:12:05.000
differential equation.,00:12:05.000,00:12:06.510
