"I think you've been exposed to
the idea of a function at some",00:00:00.600,00:00:04.340
"point in your mathematical
career.",00:00:04.340,00:00:06.500
"But what I want to do in this
video is explain it a little",00:00:06.500,00:00:08.840
"bit more formerly than you might
be used to, and then",00:00:08.840,00:00:11.550
"relate it to some of the
concepts of vectors and linear",00:00:11.550,00:00:14.420
"algebra that we've
seen so far.",00:00:14.420,00:00:15.945
"A function really is just a
relation between the members",00:00:19.585,00:00:23.340
"of one set and the members
of the other set.",00:00:23.340,00:00:25.590
"So let's have some set x, and
for every member of that set x",00:00:25.590,00:00:34.070
"I'm going to relate that member,
or associate that",00:00:34.070,00:00:37.740
"member, with another
member of a set y.",00:00:37.740,00:00:41.075
"So if I imagine that is my set
x, and that this is my set y--",00:00:43.850,00:00:53.490
"and y doesn't have to be
smaller, that's just the way I",00:00:53.490,00:00:55.830
"drew it-- the function
is just a relation.",00:00:55.830,00:00:58.110
"That if I just take a member of
my set x, let's see that's",00:00:58.110,00:01:03.290
"the member that I'm
taking, we're",00:01:03.290,00:01:04.640
visualizing it as a point.,00:01:04.640,00:01:06.640
"This function will say, OK you
gave me a member of x, then I",00:01:06.640,00:01:10.420
"will give you a member
of y associated with",00:01:10.420,00:01:12.930
that member of x.,00:01:12.930,00:01:14.660
"So the function will say, you
give me that, then I will map",00:01:14.660,00:01:18.470
it to that member right there.,00:01:18.470,00:01:24.330
"And that really just means
relating it to, or associating",00:01:24.330,00:01:27.430
with another member of y.,00:01:27.430,00:01:29.200
"And if you'd give me some other
point right here, I'll",00:01:29.200,00:01:33.780
"relate it to another
member of y.",00:01:33.780,00:01:36.000
"I might even relate it to
the same member of y.",00:01:40.170,00:01:43.240
"And so this notation just says
this is a mapping from one set",00:01:43.240,00:01:46.220
"x, and I'm speaking in
very general terms,",00:01:46.220,00:01:48.940
to another set y.,00:01:48.940,00:01:50.990
"And so you're probably saying,
Hey Sal, this is very",00:01:50.990,00:01:53.840
"abstract, how does this relate
to the functions that I've",00:01:53.840,00:01:56.260
seen in the past?,00:01:56.260,00:01:58.320
"Well let me just write down a
function you've probably seen",00:01:58.320,00:02:01.180
"a lot in the past. You've
dealt with f of x",00:02:01.180,00:02:05.520
is equal to x squared.,00:02:05.520,00:02:08.330
"How would we write this
in this notation?",00:02:08.330,00:02:10.520
"Well this is a function,
assuming that it's kind of the",00:02:10.520,00:02:13.260
"traditional way that
you see it.",00:02:13.260,00:02:14.940
"Let me just write with the f,
I was going to write it with",00:02:17.700,00:02:20.520
"the g of x, just so this doesn't
always have to be an",00:02:20.520,00:02:22.880
"f, but I think you
get that idea.",00:02:22.880,00:02:25.320
"In this case f is a mapping from
real numbers-- the real",00:02:25.320,00:02:31.400
"numbers are everything that I
can put in here-- actually",00:02:31.400,00:02:33.810
"this is part of the function
definition.",00:02:33.810,00:02:35.720
"I could constrain this to just
be integers, or just be even",00:02:35.720,00:02:39.050
"numbers, or just be
even integers.",00:02:39.050,00:02:41.160
"But this is part of the function
definition, I'm",00:02:41.160,00:02:43.790
"defining the function to be a
mapping from real numbers.",00:02:43.790,00:02:48.000
"I'm saying you can put any real
number here, and it's",00:02:48.000,00:02:50.290
going to map to real numbers.,00:02:50.290,00:02:56.860
"So in this case, if x is real
numbers, it's going to map to",00:02:56.860,00:03:00.000
"itself, which is completely
legitimate.",00:03:00.000,00:03:04.230
"So if this is the real numbers--
and obviously the",00:03:04.230,00:03:06.420
"real numbers would go off in
every direction forever-- but",00:03:06.420,00:03:08.660
"if this for real numbers, this
function mapping is just",00:03:08.660,00:03:11.790
"taking every point in
R and mapping it to",00:03:11.790,00:03:16.800
another point in R.,00:03:16.800,00:03:17.690
"It's taking every point and
associating with it its",00:03:17.690,00:03:20.580
perfect square.,00:03:20.580,00:03:21.780
"And I want to make a very subtle
notation-- or at least",00:03:21.780,00:03:24.240
"in my mind the first time that
I got exposed to functions I",00:03:24.240,00:03:26.880
"was thinking, you give me an
x and I square it, and I'm",00:03:26.880,00:03:29.680
giving you the square of x.,00:03:29.680,00:03:31.060
"And that's true, you
are doing that.",00:03:31.060,00:03:32.550
"But at least the way my brain
worked, I kind of thought of",00:03:32.550,00:03:34.690
"it as I was changing my
x into another number.",00:03:34.690,00:03:37.730
"And you can maybe view it that
way, and that might actually",00:03:37.730,00:03:39.770
be the best way to view it.,00:03:39.770,00:03:41.150
"But the mathematical definition
I'm introducing",00:03:41.150,00:03:45.400
"here is more that I'm
associating x with x squared.",00:03:45.400,00:03:55.190
"This is another function
notation of writing this exact",00:03:55.190,00:03:58.990
same thing.,00:03:58.990,00:03:59.630
"These two statements right here,
this statement and this",00:03:59.630,00:04:03.010
statement are identical.,00:04:03.010,00:04:04.530
"This statement you've probably
never seen before, but I like",00:04:04.530,00:04:07.860
"it because it shows the mapping
or the association",00:04:07.860,00:04:11.160
"more, while this association I
think that you're putting an x",00:04:11.160,00:04:16.660
"into a little meat grinder or
some machine that's going to",00:04:16.660,00:04:20.660
"ground up the x or square the x,
or do whatever it needs to",00:04:20.660,00:04:23.480
do to the x.,00:04:23.480,00:04:24.410
"This notation to me implies
the actual mapping.",00:04:24.410,00:04:27.620
"You give me an x, and I'm going
to associate another",00:04:27.620,00:04:30.070
"number in real numbers
called x squared.",00:04:30.070,00:04:32.860
"So it's going to be just
another point.",00:04:32.860,00:04:34.510
"And just as a little bit of
terminology, and I think",00:04:34.510,00:04:38.260
"you've seen this terminology
before, the set that you are",00:04:38.260,00:04:42.910
"mapping from is called the
domain and it's part of the",00:04:42.910,00:04:46.610
function definition.,00:04:46.610,00:04:47.660
"I, as the function creator, have
to tell you that every",00:04:47.660,00:04:51.620
"valid input here has to be
a set of real numbers.",00:04:51.620,00:04:55.010
"Now the set that I'm mapping
to is called the codomain.",00:04:55.010,00:05:02.920
"The obvious question that you're
probably asking is, hey",00:05:08.620,00:05:10.810
"Sal, when I learned all of this
function stuff in algebra",00:05:10.810,00:05:15.660
"II or whenever you first learned
it, we never used this",00:05:15.660,00:05:18.630
codomain word.,00:05:18.630,00:05:19.880
"We have this idea of range, I
learned the word range when I",00:05:22.770,00:05:27.100
was in 9th or 10th grade.,00:05:27.100,00:05:28.840
"How does this codomain
relate to range?",00:05:28.840,00:05:33.290
"And it's a very subtle
notation.",00:05:33.290,00:05:35.610
"So the codomain is a set that
you're mapping to, and in this",00:05:35.610,00:05:38.670
example this is the codomain.,00:05:38.670,00:05:42.035
"In this example, the real
numbers are the",00:05:42.035,00:05:44.390
domain and the codomain.,00:05:44.390,00:05:46.480
"So the question is how does
the range relate to this?",00:05:46.480,00:05:49.080
"So the codomain is the
set that can be",00:05:49.080,00:05:52.060
possibly mapped to.,00:05:52.060,00:05:53.640
"You're not necessarily
mapping to every",00:05:53.640,00:05:55.530
point in the codomain.,00:05:55.530,00:05:56.700
"I'm just saying that this
function is generally mapping",00:05:56.700,00:05:59.240
"from members of this
set to that set.",00:05:59.240,00:06:02.150
"The range is the subset --
let me write it this way.",00:06:02.150,00:06:07.920
"It could be equal
to the codomain.",00:06:07.920,00:06:10.080
It's some subset.,00:06:10.080,00:06:12.210
"A set is a subset of itself,
every member of a set is also",00:06:12.210,00:06:15.440
"a member of itself, so it's
a subset of itself.",00:06:15.440,00:06:19.320
"So range is a subset of the
codomain which the function",00:06:19.320,00:06:29.830
actually maps to.,00:06:29.830,00:06:31.150
So let me give you an example.,00:06:43.585,00:06:45.350
"Let's say I define the function
g, and it is a",00:06:45.350,00:06:52.380
"mapping from the set
of real numbers.",00:06:52.380,00:06:56.890
"Let me say it's a mapping
from R2 to R.",00:06:56.890,00:07:03.450
"So I'm essentially taking
2-tuples and I'm",00:07:03.450,00:07:06.270
mapping it to R.,00:07:06.270,00:07:07.360
"And I will define g, I'll
write it a couple",00:07:07.360,00:07:11.650
of different ways.,00:07:11.650,00:07:13.670
"So now I'm going to take g of
two values, I could say xy or",00:07:13.670,00:07:19.170
"I could say x1, x2.",00:07:19.170,00:07:20.380
Let me do it that way.,00:07:20.380,00:07:21.580
"g of x1, x2 is always
equal to 2.",00:07:21.580,00:07:32.870
"It's a mapping from R2 to R,
but this always equals 2.",00:07:32.870,00:07:38.680
"And let me actually write the
other notation just because",00:07:38.680,00:07:41.050
"you probably haven't
seen this much.",00:07:41.050,00:07:42.365
"g maps any points x1 and
x2 to the point 2.",00:07:46.450,00:07:53.630
"This makes the mapping
a little bit clearer.",00:07:53.630,00:07:55.670
"But just to get the notation
right, what is our domain?",00:07:55.670,00:07:59.183
What's the real number?,00:08:02.560,00:08:03.600
"That was part of my function
definition, I said we're",00:08:03.600,00:08:05.760
"mapping from R2, so
my domain is R2.",00:08:05.760,00:08:09.980
Now what is my codomain?,00:08:13.310,00:08:14.760
"My codomain is the set that I'm
potentially mapping to,",00:08:20.110,00:08:23.230
"and is part of the function
definition.",00:08:23.230,00:08:25.480
"This by definition
is the codomain.",00:08:25.480,00:08:27.750
So my codomain is R.,00:08:27.750,00:08:30.030
"Now what is the range
of my function?",00:08:30.030,00:08:33.190
"The range is the set of values
that the function",00:08:36.390,00:08:40.159
actually maps to.,00:08:40.159,00:08:41.770
"In this case, we always map to
the value 2, so the range is",00:08:41.770,00:08:45.710
actually just the value 2.,00:08:45.710,00:08:47.480
"And if we were to visualize
this-- R2 is actually-- I",00:08:47.480,00:08:50.650
"wouldn't draw it as a blurb, I
would draw it as the entire",00:08:50.650,00:08:53.300
"Cartesian space, but I'm just
giving you an abstract notion.",00:08:53.300,00:08:57.130
That's R2.,00:08:57.130,00:08:57.950
"If I really have to draw R, I'd
draw it as some type of a",00:08:57.950,00:09:00.270
number line.,00:09:00.270,00:09:01.840
"Actually let me do it that way
just for fun, you don't",00:09:01.840,00:09:03.740
"normally see it written
that way.",00:09:03.740,00:09:05.260
"But I could just draw R like
that's R2, and I could just",00:09:05.260,00:09:09.220
draw R as some straight line.,00:09:09.220,00:09:11.620
So this is the set R.,00:09:11.620,00:09:14.350
"I could draw it like that
as well, but let's just",00:09:14.350,00:09:16.150
say this is set R.,00:09:16.150,00:09:17.270
"And my function g essentially
maps any point over here to",00:09:17.270,00:09:23.780
exactly the point 2.,00:09:23.780,00:09:27.080
"2 is just one little
point in R.",00:09:27.080,00:09:29.050
"My function g takes any point in
R2, any coordinate, this is",00:09:29.050,00:09:36.200
"the point 3, minus 5,
whatever it is.",00:09:36.200,00:09:40.630
"It always maps it to
the point 2 in R.",00:09:40.630,00:09:43.080
"So if I think that point it
maps it to the point 2.",00:09:43.080,00:09:45.830
That's what g always does.,00:09:45.830,00:09:48.720
"So g's codomain-- you could
say it's all of the real",00:09:48.720,00:09:52.980
"numbers, but it's range
is really just 2.",00:09:52.980,00:09:55.205
"Let me do another example that
might be interesting.",00:10:00.040,00:10:02.690
"If I just write h is a function
that goes from R2 to",00:10:02.690,00:10:12.920
"R3, and I'll be a little
careful here, h",00:10:12.920,00:10:18.610
goes from R2 to R3.,00:10:18.610,00:10:20.480
"And I'll write here that h of
x1, x2 is equal to -- so now",00:10:20.480,00:10:30.385
"I'm mapping a higher dimension
space, so I'm going to say",00:10:30.385,00:10:33.140
"that that is going to be equal
to, let's say my first",00:10:33.140,00:10:37.070
"coordinate or my first component
at R3 is x1 plus x2.",00:10:37.070,00:10:43.400
"Let's say my second coordinate
is x2 minus x1.",00:10:43.400,00:10:47.440
"And let's say my third
coordinate is x2 times x1.",00:10:47.440,00:10:52.550
"Now what is my domain and my
range and my codomain?",00:10:52.550,00:11:00.150
"So my domain by definition
is this right there.",00:11:00.150,00:11:05.140
"My codomain by definition
is R3.",00:11:05.140,00:11:08.230
"And notice I'm going from a
space that has two dimensions",00:11:08.230,00:11:11.870
"to a space it has three
dimensions, or three",00:11:11.870,00:11:14.080
components.,00:11:14.080,00:11:14.590
"But I can always associate some
point with x1, x2 with",00:11:14.590,00:11:18.070
some point in my R3 there.,00:11:18.070,00:11:20.840
"A slightly trickier question
here is, what is the range?",00:11:20.840,00:11:25.840
"Can I always associate every
point-- maybe this wasn't the",00:11:25.840,00:11:30.410
"best example because it's not
simple enough -- but can I",00:11:30.410,00:11:32.940
"associate every point in R3--
so this is my codomain, my",00:11:32.940,00:11:42.190
"domain was R2, and my function
goes from R2 to",00:11:42.190,00:11:47.870
"R3, so that's h.",00:11:47.870,00:11:49.690
"And so my range, as you could
see, it's not like every",00:11:49.690,00:11:53.410
"coordinate you can express
in this way in some way.",00:11:53.410,00:11:59.710
Let me give you an example.,00:11:59.710,00:12:00.960
"I could put some x1's and x2's
here and figure it out.",00:12:03.510,00:12:07.110
Let's do that.,00:12:07.110,00:12:07.660
"Let's take our h of-- let me use
my other notation-- let's",00:12:07.660,00:12:15.120
"say that I said h, and I wanted
to find the mapping",00:12:15.120,00:12:19.070
"from the point in R2, let's
say the point 2 comma 3.",00:12:19.070,00:12:25.130
"And then my function tells me
that this will map to the",00:12:25.130,00:12:28.780
point in R3.,00:12:28.780,00:12:31.880
"I add the two terms, the
2 plus 3, so it's 5.",00:12:31.880,00:12:35.450
"I'd find the difference between
x2 and x1-- so 3 minus",00:12:35.450,00:12:39.100
"2 is 1-- and then I multiply
the two, 6.",00:12:39.100,00:12:43.150
"So clearly this will be in
the range, this is a",00:12:43.150,00:12:46.370
member of the range.,00:12:46.370,00:12:48.250
"So for example the point 2, 3,
which might be right there,",00:12:54.350,00:12:59.330
"will be mapped to the three
dimensional point, it's kind",00:12:59.330,00:13:02.180
"of just drawn as a two
dimensional blurb right there,",00:13:02.180,00:13:04.520
"but I think you get the idea,
would be mapped to the three",00:13:04.520,00:13:07.050
"dimensional point 5, 1, 6.",00:13:07.050,00:13:09.670
"So this is definitely a
member of the range.",00:13:09.670,00:13:12.860
"Now my question to you, if I
have some point in R3, let's",00:13:12.860,00:13:22.260
"say that this is the
point 5, 1, 0.",00:13:22.260,00:13:33.050
"Is this point a member
of the range?",00:13:33.050,00:13:36.200
"It's definitely a member of
the codomain, it's in R3.",00:13:36.200,00:13:38.790
"It's definitely in
here, and this by",00:13:38.790,00:13:40.110
definition is the codomain.,00:13:40.110,00:13:41.900
But is this in our range?,00:13:41.900,00:13:43.910
"5 has to be the sum of two
numbers, the 1 has to be the",00:13:46.770,00:13:50.570
"difference of two numbers, and
then the 0 would have to be",00:13:50.570,00:13:53.270
the product of two numbers.,00:13:53.270,00:13:55.350
"And clearly we know 5 is the
sum, and 1 is the difference,",00:13:55.350,00:13:57.790
"we're dealing with 2 and 3, and
there's no way you can get",00:13:57.790,00:14:00.240
"the product of those numbers
to be equal to 0.",00:14:00.240,00:14:02.750
"So this guy is not
in the range.",00:14:02.750,00:14:08.520
"So the range would be the subset
of all of these points",00:14:08.520,00:14:11.210
"in R3, so there'd be a ton of
points that aren't in the",00:14:11.210,00:14:13.660
"range, and there'll be a smaller
subset of R3 that is",00:14:13.660,00:14:17.250
in the range.,00:14:17.250,00:14:18.140
"Now I want to introduce you to
one more piece of terminology",00:14:18.140,00:14:22.970
when it comes to functions.,00:14:22.970,00:14:24.870
"These functions up here, this
function that mapped from",00:14:24.870,00:14:28.760
"points in R2 to R, so
its codomain was R.",00:14:28.760,00:14:33.690
"This function up here is
probably the most common",00:14:33.690,00:14:36.390
"function you see in mathematics,
this is also",00:14:36.390,00:14:38.940
mapping to R.,00:14:38.940,00:14:40.980
"These functions that map to R
are called scalar value or",00:14:40.980,00:14:44.560
"real value, depending on how
you want to think about it.",00:14:44.560,00:14:47.300
"But if they map to a one
dimensional space, we call",00:14:47.300,00:14:51.230
"them a scalar valued function,
or a real valued function.",00:14:51.230,00:14:54.290
"Which is pretty much all of
the functions that you've",00:15:01.990,00:15:05.000
"probably dealt with up to this
point in your mathematical",00:15:05.000,00:15:08.270
"career, unless you've taken
some vector calculus.",00:15:08.270,00:15:11.750
"Now the functions that map to
spaces or subspaces that have",00:15:11.750,00:15:19.940
"more than one dimension-- so if
you map to R or any subset",00:15:19.940,00:15:23.440
"of R, you have a real valued
function, or a",00:15:23.440,00:15:25.850
scalar valued function.,00:15:25.850,00:15:27.190
"If you map to Rn, where n is
greater than 1, so if you map",00:15:27.190,00:15:32.480
"to R2, R3, R4, R100, you're
then dealing with a vector",00:15:32.480,00:15:37.670
valued function.,00:15:37.670,00:15:38.620
"So this last function that I
defined over here, h is a",00:15:38.620,00:15:43.340
vector valued function.,00:15:43.340,00:15:50.270
"Anyway I think you now have
at least the mathematical",00:15:50.270,00:15:54.260
"notational tools to understand
what I'm going to do in the",00:15:54.260,00:15:56.870
"rest of this playlist, and
hopefully you found this",00:15:56.870,00:15:59.640
reasonably useful.,00:15:59.640,00:16:01.740
