"I've got a function f and it's
a mapping from the set",00:00:00.520,00:00:04.450
x to the set y.,00:00:04.450,00:00:08.340
"And let's just say for the sake
of argument, let's say",00:00:08.340,00:00:11.180
that f is invertible.,00:00:11.180,00:00:12.430
"What I want to know is what
does this imply about this",00:00:17.760,00:00:21.960
equation right here.,00:00:21.960,00:00:23.460
"The equation f of
x is equal to y.",00:00:23.460,00:00:27.320
"I want to know that for every
y that's a member of our",00:00:27.320,00:00:31.580
co-domains.,00:00:31.580,00:00:32.500
"So for every y, let me write
this down, for every y that's",00:00:32.500,00:00:38.420
"a member of my co-domain is
there a unique, in all caps",00:00:38.420,00:00:46.830
"UNIQUE, solution x that's
a member of our domain.",00:00:46.830,00:00:54.730
"Such that, and I could write
such that well, I'll just",00:00:54.730,00:00:58.030
write it out.,00:00:58.030,00:00:58.990
"I was going to write the mathy
way, but I think it's nicer to",00:00:58.990,00:01:01.140
"write in the actual
words sometimes.",00:01:01.140,00:01:03.510
"Such that f of x
is equal to y.",00:01:03.510,00:01:08.110
"So if we just, let me
just draw everything",00:01:08.110,00:01:09.810
out a little bit.,00:01:09.810,00:01:11.410
We have our set x right here.,00:01:11.410,00:01:14.640
This is x.,00:01:14.640,00:01:15.900
We have our co-domain y here.,00:01:15.900,00:01:19.180
"We know that f, if you take some
point here, let's call",00:01:19.180,00:01:22.420
"that a, it's a member of x and
you apply the function f to",00:01:22.420,00:01:27.450
"it, it will map you to some
element in set y.",00:01:27.450,00:01:31.210
So that's f of a right there.,00:01:31.210,00:01:33.870
"This is, so far, what
this tells us.",00:01:33.870,00:01:37.550
"Now I want to look at this
equation here, and I want to",00:01:37.550,00:01:41.560
"know that if I can pick any y
in this set any lower-case y",00:01:41.560,00:01:46.280
in this set y.,00:01:46.280,00:01:47.590
"So let's say I pick
something here.",00:01:47.590,00:01:51.490
Let's say that's b.,00:01:51.490,00:01:54.150
"I want to know is there a
unique solution to the",00:01:54.150,00:01:57.370
equation f of x is equal to b.,00:01:57.370,00:02:01.690
Is there a unique solution?,00:02:01.690,00:02:06.920
"So one, I guess, you have to
think, is there a solution.",00:02:06.920,00:02:10.110
"So is there a solution to
saying, look is there some x",00:02:10.110,00:02:13.600
"here that if I apply the
transformation f to it that I",00:02:13.600,00:02:17.210
"get there, and I also want
to know is it unique.",00:02:17.210,00:02:21.140
"For example, if this is the only
one that is unique, but",00:02:21.140,00:02:23.800
"it's not unique if there's some
other guy, if there is",00:02:23.800,00:02:25.750
"more than one, solution.",00:02:25.750,00:02:26.690
"If there is some other guy
in x that if I apply the",00:02:26.690,00:02:29.680
transformation I also go to b.,00:02:29.680,00:02:32.080
"This would make it non-unique,
not unique.",00:02:32.080,00:02:35.795
"So what I want to concern
ourselves with in this video",00:02:38.590,00:02:41.000
"is somehow, is invertibility
related to the idea of a",00:02:41.000,00:02:45.780
"unique solution to this for
any y in our co-domain.",00:02:45.780,00:02:50.500
"So let's just work through our
definitions of invertibility",00:02:50.500,00:02:53.820
"and see if we can get anywhere
constructive.",00:02:53.820,00:02:57.310
"So by definition, f is
invertible implies that there",00:02:57.310,00:03:03.940
"exists this little backward
looking, three-looking thing,",00:03:03.940,00:03:08.340
this means there exists.,00:03:08.340,00:03:09.580
"I think it's nice to be exposed
sometimes to the mathy",00:03:09.580,00:03:12.670
"notations Let me just
write that.",00:03:12.670,00:03:14.380
"That means there exists some
function, let's call it f",00:03:18.140,00:03:26.070
"inverse, that's a mapping from
y to x, such that, and",00:03:26.070,00:03:39.910
"actually the colons are also the
shorthand for such that,",00:03:39.910,00:03:43.530
but I'll write it out.,00:03:43.530,00:03:44.780
"Such that the composition of f
inverse with f is equal to the",00:03:48.855,00:03:57.090
identity on x.,00:03:57.090,00:03:59.130
"So, essentially, it's saying
look, if I apply f to",00:03:59.130,00:04:01.910
"something in x then I apply f
inverse to that, I'm going to",00:04:01.910,00:04:05.060
"get back to that point which is,
essentially, equivalent.",00:04:05.060,00:04:08.160
"Or it isn't just essentially
equivalent, it is equivalent",00:04:08.160,00:04:10.560
"to just applying the identity
function, So that's i x.",00:04:10.560,00:04:14.850
"So you just get what
you put into it.",00:04:14.850,00:04:16.769
"Such that this inverse function,
the composition of",00:04:16.769,00:04:19.722
"the inverse with the function,
is equal to",00:04:19.722,00:04:21.320
the identity function.,00:04:21.320,00:04:22.730
"And that the composition of the
function with the inverse",00:04:22.730,00:04:27.650
"function is equal to the
identity function on y.",00:04:27.650,00:04:30.540
"So if you started y and you
apply the inverse, then you",00:04:30.540,00:04:35.800
"apply the function to that,
you're going to end up back at",00:04:35.800,00:04:38.260
y at that same point.,00:04:38.260,00:04:39.490
"And that's equivalent
to just applying",00:04:39.490,00:04:41.880
the identity function.,00:04:41.880,00:04:44.350
"So this is what invertibility
tells me, this is how I",00:04:44.350,00:04:46.860
"defined invertibility
in the last video.",00:04:46.860,00:04:49.990
"Now we concerned ourselves-- so
we are concerned with this",00:04:49.990,00:04:53.400
equation up here.,00:04:53.400,00:04:54.400
"We're concerned with the
equation, I will write it in",00:04:54.400,00:04:56.650
"pink, f of x is equal to y.",00:04:56.650,00:05:01.920
"And what we want to know for
any y, or any lower-case",00:05:01.920,00:05:05.930
"cursive y in our big set
y, is there a unique",00:05:05.930,00:05:09.790
x solution to this.,00:05:09.790,00:05:12.050
"So, what we can do is we know
that f is invertible.",00:05:12.050,00:05:14.760
"I told you that from
the get-go.",00:05:14.760,00:05:16.600
"So given that f is invertible,
we know that there is this f",00:05:16.600,00:05:20.930
"inverse function, and I can
apply that f inverse function.",00:05:20.930,00:05:26.240
It's a mapping from y to x.,00:05:26.240,00:05:29.880
"So, I can apply it to
any element in y.",00:05:29.880,00:05:34.240
"So for any y, let's say that
this is my y right there.",00:05:34.240,00:05:38.280
"So I can apply my f
inverse to that y.",00:05:38.280,00:05:41.670
"And I'm going to go over here
and, of course, y is",00:05:41.670,00:05:44.520
equal to f of x.,00:05:44.520,00:05:47.260
"These are the exact
same points.",00:05:47.260,00:05:49.470
"So let's apply our f inverse
function to this.",00:05:49.470,00:05:52.560
"So if I apply the f inverse
function to both sides of the",00:05:52.560,00:05:54.790
"equation, this right here's an
element in y, and this is the",00:05:54.790,00:05:59.850
same element in y.,00:05:59.850,00:06:00.850
Right?,00:06:00.850,00:06:01.100
They are the same element.,00:06:01.100,00:06:02.570
"Now, if I apply the mapping, the
inverse mapping, to both",00:06:02.570,00:06:06.630
"of that, that's going to take
me to some element in x.",00:06:06.630,00:06:10.740
So let's do that.,00:06:10.740,00:06:13.070
"So, if I take the inverse
function on both sides of this",00:06:13.070,00:06:19.990
"equation, where some element
over here in y, and I'm taking",00:06:19.990,00:06:24.150
"the inverse function to get to
some element in x, what's this",00:06:24.150,00:06:28.650
going to be equal to?,00:06:28.650,00:06:30.330
"Well, on the right-hand side,
we could just write the f",00:06:30.330,00:06:32.940
inverse of y.,00:06:32.940,00:06:34.440
"That's going to be some
element over here.",00:06:34.440,00:06:36.850
"But what does the left-hand
side of this equation",00:06:36.850,00:06:39.150
translate to?,00:06:39.150,00:06:40.470
"The definition of this inverse
function is that when you take",00:06:40.470,00:06:42.810
"the composition with f, you're
going to end up with the",00:06:42.810,00:06:45.520
identity function.,00:06:45.520,00:06:46.410
"This is going to be equivalent
to-- let me write it this way.",00:06:46.410,00:06:48.820
"This is equal to the composition
of f inverse with",00:06:48.820,00:06:51.330
"f of x, which is equivalent to
the identity function being",00:06:51.330,00:06:56.790
applied to x.,00:06:56.790,00:06:58.120
"And then the identity function
being applied to x is what?",00:06:58.120,00:07:01.090
That's just x.,00:07:01.090,00:07:01.970
"This thing right here
just reduces to x.",00:07:01.970,00:07:05.310
This reduces to x.,00:07:05.310,00:07:06.750
"So, we started with the idea
that f is invertible.",00:07:06.750,00:07:10.040
"We use the definition of
invertibility that there",00:07:10.040,00:07:12.340
"exists this inverse function
right there.",00:07:12.340,00:07:15.760
"And then we essentially apply
the inverse function to both",00:07:15.760,00:07:18.140
"sides of this equation and say,
look you give me any y,",00:07:18.140,00:07:21.590
"any lower-case cursive y in this
set y, and I will find",00:07:21.590,00:07:26.340
you a unique x.,00:07:26.340,00:07:28.100
"This is the only x that
satisfies this equation.",00:07:28.100,00:07:33.660
"Remember how do I know
it's the only x?",00:07:33.660,00:07:35.760
"Because this is the only
possible inverse function.",00:07:35.760,00:07:38.130
"Only one inverse function
which is true.",00:07:42.690,00:07:46.740
"I proved that to you
in the last video.",00:07:46.740,00:07:48.550
"That if f is invertible,
it only has one",00:07:48.550,00:07:50.880
unique inverse function.,00:07:50.880,00:07:52.050
"We tried before to have maybe
two inverse functions, but we",00:07:52.050,00:07:55.030
"saw they have to be
the same thing.",00:07:55.030,00:07:57.140
"So since we only have one
inverse function and it",00:07:57.140,00:07:59.590
"applies to anything in this big
upper-case set y, we know",00:07:59.590,00:08:03.940
we have a solution.,00:08:03.940,00:08:04.800
"And because it's only one
inverse function, and",00:08:04.800,00:08:06.630
"functions only map to one value
in this case, then we",00:08:06.630,00:08:10.980
"know this is a unique
solution.",00:08:10.980,00:08:13.470
So let's write this down.,00:08:13.470,00:08:14.680
"So we've established that if f
is invertible, I'll do this in",00:08:14.680,00:08:18.660
"orange, then the equation f of
x is equal to y for all.",00:08:18.660,00:08:35.409
"That little v that it looks
like it's filled up with",00:08:35.409,00:08:37.470
"something, for all y, the member
of our set y, has a",00:08:37.470,00:08:44.660
unique solution.,00:08:44.660,00:08:45.910
"And that unique solution, if you
really care about it, is",00:08:56.160,00:09:00.370
"going to be the inverse
function applied to y.",00:09:00.370,00:09:02.710
"It might seem like a bit of a
no brainer, but you can see",00:09:02.710,00:09:05.440
"you have to be a little bit
precise about it in order to",00:09:05.440,00:09:07.436
get to the point you want.,00:09:07.436,00:09:08.460
"Let's see if the opposite
is true.",00:09:08.460,00:09:10.740
"Let's see if we assume-- let's
see if we start from the",00:09:10.740,00:09:14.680
"assumption, that for all y that
is a member of our set Y,",00:09:14.680,00:09:23.010
"that the solution, that the
equation f of x, is equal to y",00:09:23.010,00:09:29.530
has a unique solution.,00:09:29.530,00:09:36.490
"Let's assume this and see if it
can get us the other way.",00:09:36.490,00:09:39.440
"If given this, we can
prove invertibility.",00:09:39.440,00:09:43.690
"So let's think about
the first way.",00:09:43.690,00:09:45.060
"So we're saying that for any y--
let me draw my sets again.",00:09:45.060,00:09:49.650
"So this is my set X and this
is my set Y right there.",00:09:52.350,00:09:59.210
"Now we're working for the
assumption that you can pick",00:09:59.210,00:10:01.440
"any element in Y right here,
and then the equation right",00:10:01.440,00:10:06.670
here has a unique solution.,00:10:06.670,00:10:09.550
"Let's call that unique
solution.",00:10:09.550,00:10:11.700
"Well, we could call
it whatever.",00:10:11.700,00:10:13.220
But a unique solution x.,00:10:13.220,00:10:14.610
"So you can pick any point here,
and I've given you,",00:10:14.610,00:10:17.130
"we're assuming now, that, look,
you pick a point in Y, I",00:10:17.130,00:10:21.810
"can find you some point
in X such that f of",00:10:21.810,00:10:24.880
x is equal to y.,00:10:24.880,00:10:26.360
"And not only can I find
that for you,",00:10:26.360,00:10:28.040
that is a unique solution.,00:10:28.040,00:10:30.580
"So given that, let me define
a new function.",00:10:30.580,00:10:34.390
Let me define the function s.,00:10:34.390,00:10:37.450
"The function s is a mapping
from y to x.",00:10:37.450,00:10:40.890
"It's a mapping from y to x and s
of, let's say s of y, where,",00:10:40.890,00:10:47.740
"of course, y is a member
of our set capital-Y.",00:10:47.740,00:10:52.420
"s of y is equal to the unique
solution in x to f of x is",00:10:52.420,00:11:09.540
equal to y.,00:11:09.540,00:11:11.310
"Now, you're saying, hey, Sal, it
looks a little convoluted.",00:11:11.310,00:11:13.060
But think about it.,00:11:13.060,00:11:14.010
"This is a completely valid
function definition.",00:11:14.010,00:11:16.980
Right?,00:11:16.980,00:11:17.470
"We're starting with the idea
that you give me any y here.",00:11:17.470,00:11:20.520
"You give me any member of this
set, and I can always find you",00:11:20.520,00:11:25.260
"a unique solution to
this equation.",00:11:25.260,00:11:28.010
"Well OK, so that means that any
guy here can be associated",00:11:28.010,00:11:31.450
"with a unique solution in the
set X, where the unique",00:11:31.450,00:11:34.280
"solution is the unique
solution to",00:11:34.280,00:11:35.610
this equation here.,00:11:35.610,00:11:36.920
"So, why don't I just define a
function that says, look I'm",00:11:36.920,00:11:40.160
"going to associate every member
y with its unique",00:11:40.160,00:11:43.380
"solution to f of x
is equal to y.",00:11:43.380,00:11:46.210
"That's how I'm defining this
function right here.",00:11:46.210,00:11:48.760
"And, of course, this is
a completely valid",00:11:48.760,00:11:50.430
mapping from y to x.,00:11:50.430,00:11:51.920
"And we know that this only has
one legitimate value because",00:11:51.920,00:11:55.630
"this, any value y, any
lower-case value y, in this",00:11:55.630,00:11:59.830
"set has a unique solution
to f of x is equal to y.",00:11:59.830,00:12:03.430
"So this can only equal
one value.",00:12:03.430,00:12:05.430
So it's well defined.,00:12:05.430,00:12:07.680
"So let's apply, let's take some
element here, let me do a",00:12:07.680,00:12:15.670
"good color, let's
say this is b.",00:12:15.670,00:12:18.050
And b is a member of y.,00:12:18.050,00:12:20.520
"So let's find, so let's just map
it using our new function",00:12:20.520,00:12:23.970
right here.,00:12:23.970,00:12:24.450
"So let's take it, and map it,
and this is s of b right here.",00:12:24.450,00:12:29.650
"s of b which is a member of x
Now, we know that s of b is a",00:12:29.650,00:12:35.390
unique solution by definition.,00:12:35.390,00:12:37.450
"I know it seems a little
circular, but it's not.",00:12:37.450,00:12:39.650
"We know that s of
b is a solution.",00:12:39.650,00:12:42.600
"So we know that s of b is the
unique solution to f of x is",00:12:42.600,00:12:56.720
equal to b.,00:12:56.720,00:12:58.530
"Well, if this is the case, if
this is good, we just got this",00:12:58.530,00:13:01.670
"because this is what
this function does.",00:13:01.670,00:13:03.640
"It maps every y to the unique
solution to this equation.",00:13:03.640,00:13:08.350
"Because we said that every
y has a unique solution.",00:13:08.350,00:13:10.910
"So, if this is the case,
then what happens if I",00:13:10.910,00:13:12.810
take f of s of b.,00:13:12.810,00:13:17.150
"Well, I just said this is the
unique solution to this.",00:13:17.150,00:13:19.190
"So if I put this guy in here,
what am I going to get?",00:13:19.190,00:13:23.250
I'm going to get b.,00:13:23.250,00:13:25.410
"Or other way of saying this is
that the composition of f with",00:13:25.410,00:13:31.810
s applied to b is equal to b.,00:13:31.810,00:13:37.730
"Or another way to say it, is
that we take the composition",00:13:37.730,00:13:41.440
"of f with s, this is the same
thing, because if I apply s to",00:13:41.440,00:13:46.290
"b, and then I apply f back to
that, that's the composition,",00:13:46.290,00:13:49.090
I just get back to b.,00:13:49.090,00:13:50.170
That's what's happening here.,00:13:50.170,00:13:51.100
"So this is the same thing as
the identity function on y",00:13:51.100,00:13:55.370
being applied to b.,00:13:55.370,00:13:57.730
So it's equal to b.,00:13:57.730,00:13:58.400
"So we can say that the
composition-- we can say that",00:13:58.400,00:14:02.520
"there exists, and we know that
this function exists, or that",00:14:02.520,00:14:06.670
we can always construct this.,00:14:06.670,00:14:08.700
"So we already know
that this exists.",00:14:08.700,00:14:11.450
"This existed by me constructing
it, but I've,",00:14:11.450,00:14:13.650
"hopefully, shown you that
this is well defined.",00:14:13.650,00:14:15.960
"That from our assumption that
this always has a unique",00:14:15.960,00:14:20.100
"solution in x for any y here, I
can define this in a fairly",00:14:20.100,00:14:23.710
reasonable way.,00:14:23.710,00:14:24.330
So it definitely exists.,00:14:24.330,00:14:25.700
"And not only does it exist,
but we know that the",00:14:25.700,00:14:29.230
"composition of f with this
function that I just",00:14:29.230,00:14:33.020
"constructed here is equal to
the identity function on y.",00:14:33.020,00:14:42.710
"Now let's do another
little experiment.",00:14:42.710,00:14:46.460
"Let's take a particular-- let
me just draw sets again.",00:14:46.460,00:14:50.240
This is our set X.,00:14:52.850,00:14:54.190
"Let me take some member
of set X, call it a.",00:14:54.190,00:14:58.790
"Let me take my set
Y right there.",00:14:58.790,00:15:02.880
"And so we can apply the function
to a and we'll get a",00:15:02.880,00:15:05.350
member of set Y.,00:15:05.350,00:15:07.210
Let's call that right there.,00:15:07.210,00:15:08.960
"Let's call that f of
a right there.",00:15:08.960,00:15:15.880
"Now, if I apply my magic
function here that always, I",00:15:15.880,00:15:20.120
"can give you any member of set Y
and I'll give you the unique",00:15:20.120,00:15:23.170
"solution in X to
this equation.",00:15:23.170,00:15:25.800
"So, let me apply that to this.",00:15:25.800,00:15:27.400
Let me apply s to this.,00:15:27.400,00:15:30.290
"So, if I apply s to this it'll
give me the unique solution.",00:15:30.290,00:15:33.440
"So, let me write this down.",00:15:33.440,00:15:35.580
"So if I apply s to this, I'm
going to apply s to this-- and",00:15:35.580,00:15:44.050
"maybe I shouldn't point it back
at that, I don't want to",00:15:44.050,00:15:46.050
"imply that it necessarily
points back at that.",00:15:46.050,00:15:48.400
"So, let me apply s
that, s to this.",00:15:48.400,00:15:52.490
"So what is this going
to point to?",00:15:52.490,00:15:54.200
"What is that point going
to be right there?",00:15:54.200,00:15:57.040
"So that's going to be s of this
point, which is f of a,",00:15:57.040,00:16:03.790
"which we know is the
unique solution.",00:16:03.790,00:16:06.840
"So, this is equal to the
unique solution to the",00:16:06.840,00:16:15.570
"equation f of x is equal
to this y right here.",00:16:15.570,00:16:23.670
"Or this y right here is
just called f of a.",00:16:23.670,00:16:26.360
Right?,00:16:26.360,00:16:27.240
"Remember, the mapping s just
mapped you from any member of",00:16:27.240,00:16:31.820
"a to the unique solution
to the equation f of",00:16:31.820,00:16:35.010
x is equal to that.,00:16:35.010,00:16:36.600
"So this is the mapping from f of
a to the unique, so this s",00:16:36.600,00:16:41.650
"of f of a is going to be a
mapping to the-- or this right",00:16:41.650,00:16:44.340
"here, is going to be the
unique solution to the",00:16:44.340,00:16:46.360
"equation f of x is equal
to this member of y.",00:16:46.360,00:16:49.880
"And what's the remember
y I called?",00:16:49.880,00:16:51.740
It's called f of a.,00:16:51.740,00:16:55.760
"Well, you could go say this in
a very convoluted way, but if",00:16:55.760,00:17:00.120
"I were to just, before you
learned any linear algebra, if",00:17:00.120,00:17:02.880
"I said look if I have the
equation f of x is",00:17:02.880,00:17:06.470
equal to f of a.,00:17:06.470,00:17:08.020
"What is the unique solution
to this equation?",00:17:08.020,00:17:11.160
What does x equal?,00:17:11.160,00:17:13.290
x would have to be equal to a.,00:17:13.290,00:17:14.693
"So the unique solution to the
equation f of x is equal to f",00:17:17.510,00:17:21.030
of a is equal to a.,00:17:21.030,00:17:23.810
"And we know that there's only
one solution to that because",00:17:23.810,00:17:31.590
"that was one of our starting
assumptions.",00:17:31.590,00:17:34.170
So this thing is equal to a.,00:17:34.170,00:17:35.660
"Or we could write s of
f of a is equal to a.",00:17:35.660,00:17:42.080
"Or that the composition of s
with f is equal or applied to",00:17:42.080,00:17:47.640
a is equal to a.,00:17:47.640,00:17:50.350
"Or that the composition of s
with f is just the identity",00:17:50.350,00:17:54.920
function on the set x.,00:17:54.920,00:17:57.320
Right?,00:17:57.320,00:17:57.570
"This is a mapping right
here from x to x.",00:17:57.570,00:18:00.390
"So we could write that the
composition of s with f is the",00:18:00.390,00:18:04.630
identity on x.,00:18:04.630,00:18:06.700
"So, what have we done so far?",00:18:06.700,00:18:09.480
"We started with the idea that
you pick any y in our set",00:18:09.480,00:18:13.970
"capital-Y here and we're going
to have a unique solution x",00:18:13.970,00:18:18.290
such that this is true.,00:18:18.290,00:18:19.550
"Such that f of x
is equal to y.",00:18:19.550,00:18:21.490
"That's what the assumption
we started off with.",00:18:21.490,00:18:23.560
"We constructed this function
s that immediately maps any",00:18:23.560,00:18:27.080
"member here with its unique
solution to this equation.",00:18:27.080,00:18:30.810
Fair enough.,00:18:30.810,00:18:31.540
"Now from that, we said this
definitely exists.",00:18:31.540,00:18:34.040
"Not only does it exist, but
we figured out that the",00:18:34.040,00:18:35.850
"composition of f with our
constructed function is equal",00:18:35.850,00:18:39.310
to the identity on the set y.,00:18:39.310,00:18:42.530
"And then we also learned that
s-- the composition of s with",00:18:42.530,00:18:46.290
"f is the identity
function on x.",00:18:46.290,00:18:50.110
Let me write this.,00:18:50.110,00:18:51.180
"So we learned this, and we
also learned that the",00:18:51.180,00:18:52.940
"composition f with s is equal
to the identity on y.",00:18:52.940,00:18:58.380
"And s clearly exists because I
constructed it, and we know",00:18:58.380,00:19:01.040
"it's well defined because every
y-- for every y here",00:19:01.040,00:19:05.010
there is a solution to this.,00:19:05.010,00:19:07.300
"So given that I was able to find
for my function f, I was",00:19:07.300,00:19:13.720
"able to find a function that
these two things are true.",00:19:13.720,00:19:17.760
This is by definition.,00:19:17.760,00:19:19.580
"What it means to
be invertible.",00:19:19.580,00:19:20.830
"Remember, so this means
that f is invertible.",00:19:24.320,00:19:26.840
"Remember f being invertible,
in order for f to be",00:19:26.840,00:19:29.510
"invertible, that means there
must exist some function from,",00:19:29.510,00:19:34.780
"so if f is a mapping from to x
to y, invertibility means that",00:19:34.780,00:19:39.250
"there must be some function f
inverse that is a mapping from",00:19:39.250,00:19:43.720
"y to x such that, so I can write
there exists a function,",00:19:43.720,00:19:51.500
"the inverse function composed
with our function should be",00:19:51.500,00:19:58.610
equal to the identity on x.,00:19:58.610,00:20:03.240
"And the inverse and the function
in the composition of",00:20:03.240,00:20:07.070
"the function, with the inverse
function, should be the",00:20:07.070,00:20:09.300
identity on y.,00:20:09.300,00:20:11.340
"Well, we just found
a function.",00:20:11.340,00:20:14.370
"It exists, and that
function is s.",00:20:14.370,00:20:16.530
"Where both of these
things are true.",00:20:16.530,00:20:17.950
"We can say that s is
equal to f inverse.",00:20:17.950,00:20:21.200
So f is definitely invertible.,00:20:21.200,00:20:23.910
"So, hopefully, you found
this satisfying.",00:20:23.910,00:20:25.380
"This proof is very subtle and
very nuanced because we keep",00:20:25.380,00:20:29.220
"bouncing between our
sets X and Y.",00:20:29.220,00:20:32.340
"But what we've shown is that if
f, in the beginning part of",00:20:32.340,00:20:36.760
"this video, we show that if f
is invertible then there is",00:20:36.760,00:20:40.290
"for any y a unique solution to
the equation f of x equals y.",00:20:40.290,00:20:45.450
"And the second part of the
video, we showed that the",00:20:45.450,00:20:47.560
"other way is true, That if-- let
me put it this way, that",00:20:47.560,00:20:54.650
"if for all Y, a member of
capital Y, there is a unique",00:20:54.650,00:21:04.840
"solution to f of x is equal to
x, then f is invertible.",00:21:04.840,00:21:15.870
"So the fact that both of these
assumptions imply each other,",00:21:15.870,00:21:20.260
"we can write our final
conclusion of the video.",00:21:20.260,00:21:24.120
"That f being invertible, if f,
which is a mapping from x to y",00:21:24.120,00:21:29.540
"is invertible, this is true if
and only if, and we could",00:21:29.540,00:21:35.770
"write that either as
a two-way arrow.",00:21:35.770,00:21:38.540
"Or we could write if for if and
only if so both of these",00:21:38.540,00:21:43.000
statements imply each other.,00:21:43.000,00:21:44.380
"If and only if for all y, for
every y that is a member of",00:21:44.380,00:21:49.900
"our set y there exists a
unique-- I can actually write",00:21:49.900,00:21:59.300
"that like that means there's
exists a unique x for the-- or",00:21:59.300,00:22:07.720
"let me write this way there
exists a unique solution to",00:22:07.720,00:22:17.970
"the equation f of
x is equal to y.",00:22:17.970,00:22:27.050
"So that was our big takeaway
in this video.",00:22:27.050,00:22:29.880
"That invertibility of a function
implies there's a",00:22:29.880,00:22:32.440
"unique solution to this equation
for any y that's in",00:22:32.440,00:22:36.630
the co-domain of our function.,00:22:36.630,00:22:39.790
