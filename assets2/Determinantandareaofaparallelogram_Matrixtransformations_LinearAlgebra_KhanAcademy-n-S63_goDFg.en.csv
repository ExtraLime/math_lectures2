"I've got a 2 by 2 matrix here,
and let's just say its entries",00:00:00.450,00:00:04.800
"are a, b, c, and d.",00:00:04.800,00:00:08.690
"And it's composed of
two column vectors.",00:00:08.690,00:00:11.140
"We've done this before, let's
call this first column v1 and",00:00:11.140,00:00:15.430
"let's call the second
column v2.",00:00:15.430,00:00:19.440
So we can rewrite here.,00:00:19.440,00:00:20.860
"We can say v1 one is equal to
ac, and we could write that v2",00:00:20.860,00:00:28.440
is equal to bd.,00:00:28.440,00:00:31.890
"And these are both members of
r2, and just to have a nice",00:00:31.890,00:00:35.270
"visualization in our head,
let's graph these two.",00:00:35.270,00:00:38.870
Let me draw my axes.,00:00:38.870,00:00:41.170
That's my vertical axis.,00:00:41.170,00:00:43.870
That's my horizontal axis.,00:00:43.870,00:00:45.870
"And maybe v1 looks something
like this.",00:00:45.870,00:00:48.240
"v1 might look something
like that.",00:00:48.240,00:00:50.860
So that is v1.,00:00:50.860,00:00:53.040
"It's horizontal component will
be a, its vertical coordinant",00:00:53.040,00:00:57.222
"-- give you this as maybe a
position vector, or just how",00:00:57.222,00:01:00.870
"we're drawing it, is c.",00:01:00.870,00:01:02.950
"And then v2, let's just say it
looks something like this.",00:01:02.950,00:01:06.190
"Let's say that they're
not the same vector.",00:01:06.190,00:01:08.380
So v2 looks like that.,00:01:08.380,00:01:10.380
"v2, its horizontal coordinate
is going to b, and its",00:01:10.380,00:01:15.230
"vertical coordinate
is going to be d.",00:01:15.230,00:01:18.790
"Now, what we're going to concern
ourselves with in this",00:01:18.790,00:01:21.830
"video is the parallelogram
generated by these two guys.",00:01:21.830,00:01:25.190
"What I mean by that is, imagine
that these two guys",00:01:25.190,00:01:28.770
"are position vectors that are
specifying points on a",00:01:28.770,00:01:31.480
"parallelogram, and then of
course the -- or not of course",00:01:31.480,00:01:35.160
"but, the origin is also
another point in the",00:01:35.160,00:01:37.990
"parallelogram, so what will
be the last point on the",00:01:37.990,00:01:39.760
parallelogram?,00:01:39.760,00:01:40.970
"Well, you can imagine.",00:01:40.970,00:01:42.110
"A parallelogram, we already have
two sides of it, so the",00:01:42.110,00:01:45.380
"other two sides have
to be parallel.",00:01:45.380,00:01:46.770
"So one side look like that,
parallel to v1 the way I've",00:01:46.770,00:01:51.130
"drawn it, and the other side
will look like this.",00:01:51.130,00:01:54.700
That's our parallelogram.,00:01:54.700,00:01:56.030
"The parallelogram generated
by v2 and v1.",00:01:56.030,00:02:00.410
"What we're going to concern
ourselves with specifically is",00:02:00.410,00:02:02.700
"the area of the parallelogram
generated by v1 and v2.",00:02:02.700,00:02:14.150
So how do we figure that out?,00:02:14.150,00:02:16.120
"In general, if I have just any
parallelogram-- this is kind",00:02:16.120,00:02:18.510
"of a tilted one, but if I just
have any parallelogram, let me",00:02:18.510,00:02:21.056
"just draw any parallelogram
right there-- the area is just",00:02:21.056,00:02:26.060
"equal to the base-- so
that could be the",00:02:26.060,00:02:29.060
base-- times the height.,00:02:29.060,00:02:32.060
"So it's equal to base -- I'll
write capital B since we have",00:02:32.060,00:02:34.945
"a lowercase b there--
base times height.",00:02:34.945,00:02:38.210
"That's what the area of a
parallelogram would be.",00:02:38.210,00:02:40.560
"Now what are the base and the
height in this situation?",00:02:40.560,00:02:44.040
Let me write this down.,00:02:44.040,00:02:45.640
"The area of our parallelogram
is equal to the",00:02:45.640,00:02:48.850
base times the height.,00:02:48.850,00:02:51.310
"And actually-- well, let
me just write it here.",00:02:51.310,00:02:53.250
So what is the base here?,00:02:53.250,00:02:55.010
"The base here is going to be
the length of our vector v.",00:02:55.010,00:03:00.380
So this is our base.,00:03:00.380,00:03:02.730
"So this right here is going to
be the length of vector v1,",00:03:02.730,00:03:08.020
"the length of this orange
vector right here.",00:03:08.020,00:03:10.470
"And what's the height of this
parallelogram going to be?",00:03:10.470,00:03:14.340
"We could drop a perpendicular
here, and that, the length of",00:03:14.340,00:03:19.660
"this line right here, is
going to be our height.",00:03:19.660,00:03:23.086
"So how can we figure out that,
you know, we know what v1 is,",00:03:25.710,00:03:29.240
"so we can figure out the
base pretty easily.",00:03:29.240,00:03:31.010
"But how can we figure
out the height?",00:03:31.010,00:03:35.490
"Well, one thing we can do is, if
we can figure out this guy",00:03:35.490,00:03:39.110
"right here, we could use the
Pythagorean theorem.",00:03:39.110,00:03:43.580
"Because the length of this
vector squared, plus H",00:03:43.580,00:03:49.110
"squared, is going to be equal
to the length of v2 squared.",00:03:49.110,00:03:53.130
"So let's see if we
can do that.",00:03:53.130,00:03:54.960
What is this guy?,00:03:54.960,00:03:56.080
"What is this green
guy right here?",00:03:56.080,00:03:58.510
"Well if you imagine a line--
let's imagine some line l.",00:03:58.510,00:04:03.160
"So let's say l is a line
spanned by v1.",00:04:03.160,00:04:09.410
"Which means you take all of the
multiples of v1, and all",00:04:15.390,00:04:20.279
"of the positions that they
specify will create a set of",00:04:20.279,00:04:22.580
"points, and that is my line l.",00:04:22.580,00:04:24.345
"So you take all the multiples
of v1, you're going to get",00:04:24.345,00:04:26.530
every point along this line.,00:04:26.530,00:04:29.835
Just like that.,00:04:29.835,00:04:31.950
"Now if we have l defined that
way-- that line right there is",00:04:31.950,00:04:35.714
"l, I don't know if
you can see it.",00:04:35.714,00:04:36.610
"Let me do it a little bit better
-- and it goes through",00:04:36.610,00:04:38.680
"v1 and it just keeps
going over there.",00:04:38.680,00:04:40.560
"What is this green
line right there?",00:04:40.560,00:04:43.840
"This green line that we're
concerned with, that's the",00:04:43.840,00:04:46.450
projection onto l of what?,00:04:46.450,00:04:52.080
"Well, we have a perpendicular
here, you can imagine the",00:04:52.080,00:04:54.830
"light source coming down-- I
don't know if that analogy",00:04:54.830,00:04:57.060
"helps you-- but it's kind
of the shadow of",00:04:57.060,00:04:58.540
v2 onto that line.,00:04:58.540,00:05:00.850
"So it's a projection of v2, of
your vector v2 onto l is this",00:05:00.850,00:05:06.490
green line right there.,00:05:06.490,00:05:08.360
"So, if we want to figure out
H, we can just use the",00:05:08.360,00:05:13.010
Pythagorean theorem.,00:05:13.010,00:05:14.550
"So we can say that the length
of H squared-- well I'm just",00:05:14.550,00:05:19.830
"writing H as the length,
I'm not even",00:05:19.830,00:05:21.370
specifying it as a vector.,00:05:21.370,00:05:23.040
"So we could say that H squared,
where that is the",00:05:23.040,00:05:26.560
"length of this line, plus the
length of this vector",00:05:26.560,00:05:31.550
"squared-- and the length of
that vector squared is the",00:05:31.550,00:05:34.130
"length of the projection
onto l of v2.",00:05:34.130,00:05:37.010
"I'll do that in a
different color.",00:05:37.010,00:05:40.130
"So the length of the projection
onto l of v2",00:05:40.130,00:05:48.720
squared-- all right?,00:05:48.720,00:05:49.870
"We're just doing the Pythagorean
theorem.",00:05:49.870,00:05:51.530
"This squared plus this
squared is going",00:05:51.530,00:05:52.870
to equal that squared.,00:05:52.870,00:05:54.320
"It's going to be equal to the
length of v2 squared.",00:05:54.320,00:06:01.930
"That's just the Pythagorean
theorem.",00:06:01.930,00:06:03.410
Nothing fancy there.,00:06:07.670,00:06:10.550
So how can we simplify?,00:06:10.550,00:06:11.740
We want to solve for H.,00:06:11.740,00:06:14.470
"And actually, let's just solve
for H squared for now because",00:06:14.470,00:06:17.230
"it'll keep things a little
bit simpler.",00:06:17.230,00:06:19.200
"So we can say that H squared is
equal to this guy, is equal",00:06:19.200,00:06:25.160
"to the length of my vector v2
squared minus the length of",00:06:25.160,00:06:30.400
the projection squared.,00:06:30.400,00:06:32.390
"So minus -- I'll do that in
purple -- minus the length of",00:06:32.390,00:06:36.740
"the projection onto
l of v2 squared.",00:06:36.740,00:06:42.410
"Remember, this thing is just
this thing right here, we're",00:06:42.410,00:06:44.750
"just doing the Pythagorean
theorem.",00:06:44.750,00:06:46.860
"So let's see if we can simplify
this, or write it in",00:06:46.860,00:06:49.680
terms that we understand.,00:06:49.680,00:06:51.700
"So the length of a vector
squared, this is just equal",00:06:51.700,00:06:55.620
"to-- let me write it this
way-- this is just",00:06:55.620,00:06:58.390
equal to v2 dot v2.,00:06:58.390,00:07:02.630
"You take a vector, you dot it
with itself, and you get the",00:07:02.630,00:07:04.880
"length of that vector
squared, we saw that",00:07:04.880,00:07:06.550
"many, many videos ago.",00:07:06.550,00:07:08.370
"And then what is this guy
going to be equal to?",00:07:08.370,00:07:11.710
"Well, the projection--
I'll do it over here.",00:07:11.710,00:07:13.410
"The projection onto l of v2 is
going to be equal to v2 dot",00:07:13.410,00:07:20.700
"the spanning vector,
which is v1.",00:07:20.700,00:07:23.580
"So it's v2 dot v1 over the
spanning vector dotted with",00:07:23.580,00:07:31.200
"itself, v1 dot v1.",00:07:31.200,00:07:33.810
"We saw this several videos
ago when we learned about",00:07:33.810,00:07:36.370
projections.,00:07:36.370,00:07:37.380
"And this is just a number
right there.",00:07:37.380,00:07:40.510
"And then it's going
to be times the",00:07:40.510,00:07:42.860
spanning vector itself.,00:07:42.860,00:07:44.960
So times v1.,00:07:44.960,00:07:48.400
"That is what the
projection is.",00:07:48.400,00:07:50.390
"So it's going to be this
minus the length of",00:07:50.390,00:07:55.000
the projection squared.,00:07:55.000,00:07:56.440
"What is the length of the
projection squared?",00:07:56.440,00:07:59.100
"Well that's this guy dotted
with himself.",00:07:59.100,00:08:04.080
"Let me write it this way, let
me take it step by step.",00:08:04.080,00:08:07.970
"So this is going to be minus--
I'm want to make sure I can",00:08:07.970,00:08:12.240
"still see that up there so I
don't have to rewrite it.",00:08:12.240,00:08:16.250
"The projection is going to be,
it looks a little complicated",00:08:16.250,00:08:19.110
"but hopefully things will
simplify, v2 dot v1 over v1",00:08:19.110,00:08:25.020
"dot v1 times-- switch colors--
times the vector-- this is all",00:08:25.020,00:08:31.250
"just going to end up being a
number, remember you take dot",00:08:31.250,00:08:33.370
"products, you get numbers--
times the vector v1.",00:08:33.370,00:08:37.050
"And we're going to take
the length of",00:08:37.050,00:08:38.570
that whole thing squared.,00:08:38.570,00:08:42.039
"And all of this is going to
be equal to H squared.",00:08:42.039,00:08:45.670
"Once again, just the Pythagorean
Theorem.",00:08:45.670,00:08:48.300
"This or this squared, which is
the height squared, is equal",00:08:48.300,00:08:52.820
"to your hypotenuse squared,
this is your hypotenuse",00:08:52.820,00:08:55.490
"squared, minus the other
side squared.",00:08:55.490,00:08:57.280
"This is the other
side squared.",00:08:57.280,00:08:58.640
"Looks a little complicated, but
it was just a projection",00:08:58.640,00:09:00.770
"of this guy on to that
right there.",00:09:00.770,00:09:03.800
"So let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.",00:09:03.800,00:09:06.840
"We're just going to have to
break out some algebra or let",00:09:06.840,00:09:10.410
s can do here.,00:09:10.410,00:09:11.390
"Well actually, not algebra,
some linear algebra.",00:09:11.390,00:09:13.470
So what is this guy?,00:09:13.470,00:09:15.060
"Well this guy is just the dot
product of this with itself.",00:09:15.060,00:09:18.930
"So this is just equal to-- we
know, I mean any vector, if",00:09:18.930,00:09:23.610
"you take the square of its
length, it's just that vector",00:09:23.610,00:09:25.830
dotted with itself.,00:09:25.830,00:09:26.660
"So this thing, if we are taking
the square of this",00:09:26.660,00:09:29.290
"guy's length, it's just
equal to this",00:09:29.290,00:09:30.550
guy dotted with himself.,00:09:30.550,00:09:32.570
"Let me write everything
over again.",00:09:32.570,00:09:34.950
"So we get H squared is equal to
v2 dot v2, and then minus",00:09:34.950,00:09:45.210
this guy dotted with himself.,00:09:45.210,00:09:46.900
"So minus v2 dot v1 over v1 dot
v1, times the vector v1,",00:09:46.900,00:09:58.790
dotted with itself.,00:09:58.790,00:10:03.000
"Dotted with v2 dot v1--
remember, this green part is",00:10:03.000,00:10:07.420
"just a number-- over
v1 dot v1 times v1.",00:10:07.420,00:10:15.000
And what is this equal to?,00:10:15.000,00:10:16.063
Let's just simplify this.,00:10:16.063,00:10:17.810
"These are just scalar
quantities, and we saw that",00:10:17.810,00:10:20.370
"the dot product is associative
with respect to scalar",00:10:20.370,00:10:23.110
"quantities, so we can just
change the order here.",00:10:23.110,00:10:25.190
"So this is going to be
equal to the scalar",00:10:25.190,00:10:26.640
quantity times itself.,00:10:26.640,00:10:28.750
"So we could say this is
equal to v2 dot v1.",00:10:28.750,00:10:36.110
Let me write it this way.,00:10:36.110,00:10:37.260
"V2 dot v1, that's going to
be-- and we're going to",00:10:37.260,00:10:40.000
"multiply the numerator times
itself, v2 dot v1.",00:10:40.000,00:10:44.660
"And then all of that over v1
dot v1 times v1 dot v1.",00:10:44.660,00:10:53.240
"Remember, I'm just taking
these two terms and",00:10:53.240,00:10:54.690
"multiplying them
by each other.",00:10:54.690,00:10:56.290
"I'm just switching the order,
and then we know that the",00:10:56.290,00:10:59.460
"scalars can be taken out,
times these two",00:10:59.460,00:11:02.690
guys dot each other.,00:11:02.690,00:11:03.750
Times v1 dot v1.,00:11:03.750,00:11:07.470
"That's what this
simplifies to.",00:11:07.470,00:11:10.000
Now this is now a number.,00:11:10.000,00:11:11.830
"We had vectors here, but when
you take a dot product, you",00:11:11.830,00:11:14.000
just get a number.,00:11:14.000,00:11:14.650
"And this number is the
same as this number.",00:11:14.650,00:11:17.180
"So we can simplify
a little bit.",00:11:17.180,00:11:18.780
"So we can cross those two guys
out, and then we are left with",00:11:18.780,00:11:24.270
"that our height squared
is equal to this",00:11:24.270,00:11:30.850
expression times itself.,00:11:30.850,00:11:32.960
"We have it times itself twice,
so it's equal to-- let me",00:11:32.960,00:11:35.930
start over here.,00:11:35.930,00:11:36.680
"It's equal to v2 dot v2 minus
this guy times itself.",00:11:36.680,00:11:45.630
"So v2 dot v1 squared, all of
that over just one of these",00:11:45.630,00:11:53.790
guys. v1 dot v1.,00:11:53.790,00:11:59.370
"That is what the height
squared is.",00:11:59.370,00:12:01.650
"Now we have the height squared,
we could take the",00:12:01.650,00:12:03.480
"square root if we just want
to solve for the height.",00:12:03.480,00:12:05.670
"But to keep our math simple, we
know that area is equal to",00:12:05.670,00:12:10.350
base times height.,00:12:10.350,00:12:12.080
"Let's just say what the area
squared is equal to.",00:12:12.080,00:12:14.660
"Because then both of these
terms will get squared.",00:12:14.660,00:12:18.410
"So if the area is equal to base
times height-- we saw",00:12:18.410,00:12:22.024
"that at the beginning of the
video-- then the area squared",00:12:22.024,00:12:24.970
"is going to be equal to these
two guys squared.",00:12:24.970,00:12:26.780
"It's going to be equal to base
squared times height squared.",00:12:26.780,00:12:30.640
Now what is the base squared?,00:12:30.640,00:12:33.440
Let me do it like this.,00:12:33.440,00:12:34.990
"So the base squared-- we already
saw, the base of our",00:12:34.990,00:12:38.900
"parallelogram is the length
of vector v1.",00:12:38.900,00:12:49.590
Now what is the base squared?,00:12:49.590,00:12:51.830
"The base squared is going
to be the length",00:12:51.830,00:12:54.580
of vector v1 squared.,00:12:54.580,00:12:58.030
"Or another way of writing
that is v1 dot v1.",00:12:58.030,00:13:03.730
"And we already know what the
height squared is, it's this",00:13:03.730,00:13:06.300
expression right there.,00:13:06.300,00:13:08.520
Let me write that down.,00:13:08.520,00:13:09.780
"The height squared is the height
squared right there.",00:13:09.780,00:13:12.550
"So what is our area squared
going to be?",00:13:12.550,00:13:15.890
"Our area squared-- let me go
down here where I'll have more",00:13:15.890,00:13:21.290
"space-- our area squared is
going to be equal to our base",00:13:21.290,00:13:25.610
"squared, which is v1 dot v1
times our height squared.",00:13:25.610,00:13:30.865
"Let with me write
it like this.",00:13:33.750,00:13:35.275
"No, I was using the
wrong color.",00:13:38.780,00:13:41.170
"Times this guy over here. v2 dot
v2 minus v2 dot v1 squared",00:13:41.170,00:13:52.900
over v1 dot v1.,00:13:52.900,00:13:57.830
"Now what does this
simplified to?",00:13:57.830,00:14:00.230
"Well, this is just a number,
these are all just numbers.",00:14:00.230,00:14:02.670
"So if I multiply, if I
distribute this out, this is",00:14:02.670,00:14:05.310
equal to what?,00:14:05.310,00:14:06.590
"This times this is equal to v1--
let me color code it-- v1",00:14:06.590,00:14:12.340
"dot v1 times this guy
times v2 dot v2.",00:14:12.340,00:14:22.100
"And then when I multiplied
this guy times",00:14:22.100,00:14:23.680
"that guy, what happens?",00:14:23.680,00:14:25.010
"Well I have this guy in the
numerator and that guy in the",00:14:25.010,00:14:26.660
"denominator, so they
cancel out.",00:14:26.660,00:14:28.010
"So I'm just left with minus
v2 dot v1 squared.",00:14:28.010,00:14:37.700
"Now let's remind ourselves what
these two vectors were.",00:14:37.700,00:14:40.650
"v1 was the vector ac and
v2 is the vector bd.",00:14:40.650,00:14:44.650
"Let me rewrite it down here so
we have it to work with.",00:14:44.650,00:14:48.110
"So v1 was equal to the vector
ac, and v2 is equal",00:14:48.110,00:14:54.760
to the vector bd.,00:14:54.760,00:14:57.600
So what is v1 dot v1?,00:14:57.600,00:14:59.790
"That is equal to a dot
a, a times a, a",00:15:03.320,00:15:08.750
squared plus c squared.,00:15:08.750,00:15:11.020
"That's this, right there.",00:15:11.020,00:15:12.990
And that's what? v2 dot v2.,00:15:12.990,00:15:14.800
"So we're going to have
that times v2 dot v2.",00:15:14.800,00:15:19.740
"v2 dot v2 is v squared
plus d squared.",00:15:19.740,00:15:25.030
"And then we're going to have
minus v2 dot v1 squared.",00:15:25.030,00:15:30.450
So what's v2 dot v1?,00:15:30.450,00:15:34.080
"It's b times a, plus d times c,
or a times b plus -- we're",00:15:34.080,00:15:38.590
just dotting these two guys.,00:15:38.590,00:15:39.850
"So it's ab plus cd, and then
we're squaring it.",00:15:39.850,00:15:46.600
"And let's see what this
simplifies to.",00:15:46.600,00:15:48.910
"Hopefully it simplifies
to something.",00:15:48.910,00:15:51.630
Let me switch colors.,00:15:51.630,00:15:53.050
"So if we just multiply this
out, let me write it here.",00:15:53.050,00:15:55.550
"Our area squared is equal to
a squared times b squared.",00:15:55.550,00:15:59.185
"a squared times d squared,
plus c squared times b",00:16:01.930,00:16:08.150
"squared, plus c squared
times d squared.",00:16:08.150,00:16:13.670
"And then minus this
guy squared.",00:16:17.350,00:16:21.220
"What is that going
to be equal to?",00:16:21.220,00:16:22.960
"ab squared is a squared,
b squared.",00:16:22.960,00:16:26.620
"And then I'm going to multiply
these guys times each other",00:16:26.620,00:16:29.650
"twice, so that's going
to be plus 2abcd.",00:16:29.650,00:16:35.750
"And then you're going to have
a plus c squared, d squared.",00:16:35.750,00:16:40.020
"I just foiled this out, that's
the best way you",00:16:40.020,00:16:42.260
could think about it.,00:16:42.260,00:16:44.010
"And then, if I distribute this
negative sign, what do I have?",00:16:44.010,00:16:47.920
Let me rewrite everything.,00:16:47.920,00:16:49.230
"It's equal to a squared b
squared, plus a squared d",00:16:49.230,00:16:53.380
"squared, plus c squared b
squared, plus c squared d",00:16:53.380,00:16:59.100
"squared, minus a squared b
squared, minus 2abcd, minus c",00:16:59.100,00:17:08.060
"squared, d squared.",00:17:08.060,00:17:09.200
"All I did is, I distributed
the minus sign.",00:17:09.200,00:17:11.920
"Now it looks like some things
will simplify nicely.",00:17:11.920,00:17:14.960
"And now remember, all this is
equal to our area squared.",00:17:14.960,00:17:17.550
"We have a ab squared, we have
a minus ab squared.",00:17:17.550,00:17:21.180
They cancel out.,00:17:21.180,00:17:22.589
"We have a minus cd squared
and a cd squared,",00:17:22.589,00:17:27.130
so they cancel out.,00:17:27.130,00:17:28.650
"So all we're left with is that
the area of our parallelogram",00:17:28.650,00:17:32.100
"squared is equal to a squared
d squared minus 2abcd plus c",00:17:32.100,00:17:45.490
squared b squared.,00:17:45.490,00:17:47.740
"Now this might look a little bit
bizarre to you, but if you",00:17:51.920,00:17:55.910
"made a substitution right here,
if you said that x is",00:17:55.910,00:17:59.210
"equal to ad, and if you said y
is equal to cb, then what does",00:17:59.210,00:18:04.540
this become?,00:18:04.540,00:18:06.730
"This is equal to x
squared minus 2",00:18:06.730,00:18:10.220
times xy plus y squared.,00:18:10.220,00:18:14.180
Right?,00:18:14.180,00:18:14.750
Hopefully you recognize this.,00:18:14.750,00:18:15.740
"And this is just the same thing
as x minus y squared.",00:18:15.740,00:18:20.610
"So, if this is our substitutions
we made-- I did",00:18:20.610,00:18:23.580
"this just so you can visualize
this a little bit better.",00:18:23.580,00:18:26.940
"So we have our area squared is
equal to x minus y squared or",00:18:26.940,00:18:32.980
"ad minus cb, or let me
write it, bc squared.",00:18:32.980,00:18:39.640
"That's what the area of our
parallelogram squared is.",00:18:39.640,00:18:43.960
"And if you don't quite
understand what I did here, I",00:18:43.960,00:18:46.540
"just made these substitutions
so you can",00:18:46.540,00:18:47.890
recognize it better.,00:18:47.890,00:18:49.080
"But just understand that this
is the same thing as this.",00:18:49.080,00:18:51.010
"If you want, you can just
multiply this guy out and",00:18:51.010,00:18:54.100
you'll get that right there.,00:18:54.100,00:18:55.670
But what is this?,00:18:55.670,00:18:58.650
What is this thing right here?,00:18:58.650,00:19:00.700
It's the determinant.,00:19:00.700,00:19:02.250
"This is the determinant of
our original matrix.",00:19:02.250,00:19:05.470
"Well, I called that matrix A
and then I used A again for",00:19:09.380,00:19:12.710
"area, so let me write
it this way.",00:19:12.710,00:19:15.460
"Area squared -- let me
write it like this.",00:19:15.460,00:19:19.880
"Area squared is equal to
ad minus bc squared.",00:19:19.880,00:19:27.870
"So this is area, these
A's are all area.",00:19:27.870,00:19:31.940
But what is this?,00:19:31.940,00:19:32.940
"This is the determinant
of my matrix.",00:19:32.940,00:19:34.770
"That is the determinant of my
matrix A, my original matrix",00:19:34.770,00:19:43.050
"that I started the problem with,
which is equal to the",00:19:43.050,00:19:45.680
determinant of abcd.,00:19:45.680,00:19:48.380
Right?,00:19:48.380,00:19:48.870
"The determinant of this is ad
minus bc, by definition.",00:19:48.870,00:19:54.340
"So your area-- this
is exciting!",00:19:54.340,00:19:59.190
"So the area of your
parallelogram squared is equal",00:19:59.190,00:20:02.140
"to the determinant of the matrix
whose column vectors",00:20:02.140,00:20:06.070
construct that parallelogram.,00:20:06.070,00:20:08.210
"Is equal to the determinant
of your matrix squared.",00:20:08.210,00:20:12.650
"Or if you take the square root
of both sides, you get the",00:20:12.650,00:20:14.690
"area is equal to the absolute
value of the determinant of A.",00:20:14.690,00:20:19.980
"Which is a pretty neat
outcome, especially",00:20:19.980,00:20:22.030
"considering how much hairy
algebra we had to go through.",00:20:22.030,00:20:24.732
"Let's go back all the way over
here, go back to the drawing.",00:20:24.732,00:20:28.720
"So if we want to figure out the
area of this parallelogram",00:20:28.720,00:20:34.740
"right here, that is defined, or
that is created, by the two",00:20:34.740,00:20:39.610
"column vectors of a matrix, we
literally just have to find",00:20:39.610,00:20:44.620
the determinant of the matrix.,00:20:44.620,00:20:46.460
"The area of this is equal to
the absolute value of the",00:20:46.460,00:20:51.620
determinant of A.,00:20:51.620,00:20:52.630
And you have to do that because,00:20:52.630,00:20:54.060
this might be negative.,00:20:54.060,00:20:55.930
"You can imagine if you swapped
these guys around, if you",00:20:55.930,00:20:58.830
"swapped some of the rows, this
guy would be negative, but you",00:20:58.830,00:21:01.150
can 't have a negative area.,00:21:01.150,00:21:02.230
"And it wouldn't really change
the definition, it really",00:21:02.230,00:21:04.560
wouldn't change what spanned.,00:21:04.560,00:21:05.730
"If you switched v1 and v2,
you're still spanning the same",00:21:05.730,00:21:08.960
"parallelogram, you just might
get the negative of the",00:21:08.960,00:21:11.470
determinant.,00:21:11.470,00:21:12.770
"But that is a really
neat outcome.",00:21:12.770,00:21:14.640
"And you know, when you first
learned determinants in",00:21:14.640,00:21:17.240
"school-- I mean, we learned
the first motivation for a",00:21:17.240,00:21:20.000
"determinant was this idea of
when we take the inverse of a",00:21:20.000,00:21:24.640
"2 by 2, this thing shows up in
the denominator and we call",00:21:24.640,00:21:27.110
that the determinant.,00:21:27.110,00:21:28.180
"But now there's this other
interpretation here.",00:21:28.180,00:21:30.470
"There's actually the area of the
parallelogram created by",00:21:30.470,00:21:33.590
"the column vectors
of this matrix.",00:21:33.590,00:21:36.360
