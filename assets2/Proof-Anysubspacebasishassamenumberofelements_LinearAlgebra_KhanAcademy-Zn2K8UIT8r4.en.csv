"Let's say I've got some set
A of the vectors a1, a2,",00:00:00.490,00:00:06.170
all the way to an.,00:00:06.170,00:00:08.109
"And I know for a fact that
it's a basis for",00:00:08.109,00:00:12.620
the subspace V.,00:00:12.620,00:00:14.990
"What I want to show you in this
video is that if this guy",00:00:14.990,00:00:18.400
"has n elements right here, that
any set that spans V has",00:00:18.400,00:00:25.210
"to have at least n elements,
[typing]",00:00:25.210,00:00:29.210
"or n members, or cardinality
of n.",00:00:43.070,00:00:46.160
"There's all different ways
of saying you had n",00:00:46.160,00:00:48.020
vectors in this set.,00:00:48.020,00:00:49.270
"I'm saying that every set that
spans V must have at least n",00:00:52.700,00:00:56.920
"elements, if the sum basis
set has n elements for V.",00:00:56.920,00:01:01.340
"Let's see if we can kind of run
with the set that has less",00:01:01.340,00:01:04.959
"than n elements and see if we
reach any contradictions.",00:01:04.959,00:01:07.820
"So let's say that I have sum set
B here and it's equal to",00:01:07.820,00:01:13.155
"the vectors b1, b2,
all the way to bm.",00:01:13.155,00:01:18.330
"And m is less than n, so I have
sum set of vectors here",00:01:18.330,00:01:22.420
"that have fewer elements
than my set A.",00:01:22.420,00:01:27.060
"So you come to me one day and
say, look I found you this set",00:01:27.060,00:01:30.180
of vectors right here.,00:01:30.180,00:01:31.390
"And not only does it have
fewer elements than A,",00:01:31.390,00:01:34.140
but it spans V.,00:01:34.140,00:01:37.500
"I look at you very suspiciously
because I always",00:01:37.500,00:01:39.460
"thought that this green
statement was true.",00:01:39.460,00:01:41.440
"So we start a little bit of
a thought experiment.",00:01:41.440,00:01:43.860
"And I say OK, you claim
that your set spans",00:01:43.860,00:01:46.970
"V, so let's do something.",00:01:46.970,00:01:48.900
Let me define a new set.,00:01:48.900,00:01:50.500
"Let me call this new set B1
prime, and you'll see why I'm",00:01:50.500,00:01:55.080
"doing this kind of
strange notation.",00:01:55.080,00:01:57.430
"What's essentially going to be
is a set B plus my vector a1.",00:01:57.430,00:02:03.230
"So it's a1, and then I have
all of my elements of B.",00:02:03.230,00:02:07.070
"So be b1, b2, all
the way to bm.",00:02:07.070,00:02:12.350
"Now I think you and I could both
agree that this set is",00:02:12.350,00:02:15.390
linearly dependent.,00:02:15.390,00:02:18.530
How do I know that?,00:02:18.530,00:02:19.240
"Linear dependence means that at
least one of the elements",00:02:19.240,00:02:22.240
"of the set can be represented
as a linear",00:02:22.240,00:02:24.100
combination of the others.,00:02:24.100,00:02:25.720
"Well, we know that a1 is one of
the basis vectors for V for",00:02:25.720,00:02:30.610
this definition of a basis.,00:02:30.610,00:02:31.800
"But all the basis vectors
are members of V.",00:02:31.800,00:02:36.510
"If this set is a basis for V,
then this means that this set",00:02:41.520,00:02:44.970
"spans V, or that every member
of V can be represented as a",00:02:44.970,00:02:48.360
"linear combination
of these guys.",00:02:48.360,00:02:49.990
"Or in other ways every
linear combination of",00:02:49.990,00:02:51.980
these guys is in V.,00:02:51.980,00:02:53.710
"And one of the linear
combinations of these guys is",00:02:53.710,00:02:55.600
"you just set the coefficient
on a1 to be 1, and the",00:02:55.600,00:03:01.280
"coefficients on everyone
else to be 0.",00:03:01.280,00:03:03.240
"So obviously a1 is
also in the set.",00:03:03.240,00:03:05.610
"So if a1 is in V, and all
of these guys span V, by",00:03:05.610,00:03:12.110
"definition if these guys span
V some linear combination of",00:03:12.110,00:03:15.680
"these guys can be used to
construct any member of V.",00:03:15.680,00:03:19.390
"So you can take some linear
combination of these guys to",00:03:19.390,00:03:21.910
construct a1.,00:03:21.910,00:03:23.010
"So you could say a1 is equal to
d1, where the d's are the",00:03:23.010,00:03:29.590
"constants, d1 b1 plus d2 b2, all
the way to dm bm, and at",00:03:29.590,00:03:37.950
"least one of these have
to be non-zero.",00:03:37.950,00:03:40.080
"We know that a is a
non-zero vector.",00:03:40.080,00:03:42.010
"If it was a 0 vector, this
couldn't be a basis because it",00:03:42.010,00:03:44.800
"wouldn't be linearly
independent, because you can",00:03:44.800,00:03:47.570
"always represent a 0 vector
as really just 0",00:03:47.570,00:03:51.210
times any other vector.,00:03:51.210,00:03:52.270
So this won't be a 0 vector.,00:03:52.270,00:03:53.830
"So at least one of these
are non-zero.",00:03:53.830,00:03:56.390
"So let's just say, for the sake
of argument, that dj --",00:03:56.390,00:04:01.130
"so the coefficient on
bj is non-zero.",00:04:01.130,00:04:04.550
So dj does not equal 0.,00:04:04.550,00:04:08.610
"So we could actually solve
for that term.",00:04:08.610,00:04:11.910
"So over here someplace you have
the term dj bj, plus a",00:04:11.910,00:04:16.959
bunch of other stuff.,00:04:16.959,00:04:18.010
"We can solve for this term if we
subtract it from both sides",00:04:18.010,00:04:21.110
"of the equation, and then divide
both sides by minus dj,",00:04:21.110,00:04:25.070
"and put this minus a1 on the
other side, what do we get?",00:04:25.070,00:04:29.360
"I know that was a lot of
operations, but that's just",00:04:29.360,00:04:30.960
straight up algebra.,00:04:30.960,00:04:31.750
"I think you can say that we
could rewrite this right here.",00:04:31.750,00:04:34.470
We can solve for bj.,00:04:34.470,00:04:35.720
"That should be equal to minus
1 over its coefficient.",00:04:41.360,00:04:46.470
"And, if we subtract the a1 from
both sides and then plus",00:04:46.470,00:04:51.620
"all of these guys, plus d1 b1
plus all the way -- you're",00:04:51.620,00:04:57.640
"going to have a little
bit of a gap here.",00:04:57.640,00:04:59.300
I'll just draw it like that.,00:04:59.300,00:05:00.080
"It's very unconventional
notation where this guy sat.",00:05:00.080,00:05:02.370
All the way to dm bm.,00:05:02.370,00:05:06.090
"I'm doing this all of this to
show you that, by definition,",00:05:06.090,00:05:10.160
"you can write a1 as a
linear combination",00:05:10.160,00:05:12.240
of these other guys.,00:05:12.240,00:05:13.050
"But you can just rearrange
things.",00:05:13.050,00:05:14.400
"You can rearrange it so that you
can write one of the other",00:05:14.400,00:05:18.160
"guys as a linear combination
of the rest of the",00:05:18.160,00:05:20.180
other guys and a1.,00:05:20.180,00:05:21.910
This guy's now redundant.,00:05:24.490,00:05:27.330
"I don't need this guy any longer
to continue to span V.",00:05:27.330,00:05:30.780
"Clearly this set
still spans V.",00:05:30.780,00:05:32.860
I added an extra vector here.,00:05:32.860,00:05:35.270
"But I can remove this guy right
here from my set b1",00:05:35.270,00:05:41.390
prime and still span V.,00:05:41.390,00:05:43.980
And how do I know that?,00:05:43.980,00:05:45.080
Because I can achieve him.,00:05:45.080,00:05:47.410
"By removing him, I don't
lose anything.",00:05:47.410,00:05:49.220
"Because if I needed this vector
to create some other",00:05:49.220,00:05:51.550
"vector, I can construct him with
a linear combination of",00:05:51.550,00:05:54.310
"the rest of the b's,
plus my a1.",00:05:54.310,00:05:59.180
"So let's get rid of him,
and call that set v1.",00:05:59.180,00:06:02.680
"And actually, just for the sake
of notation, let me just",00:06:02.680,00:06:05.270
change his name.,00:06:05.270,00:06:07.600
This is little unconventional.,00:06:07.600,00:06:08.840
"You won't see it done like
this in any textbook.",00:06:08.840,00:06:11.350
"But I think it's a little bit
easier, instead of having to",00:06:11.350,00:06:13.470
"keep talking about these little
guys that are embedded",00:06:13.470,00:06:16.420
"someplace in the middle
of the stream.",00:06:16.420,00:06:18.250
"I mean these names, b1, b2, bn,
they're arbitrary names.",00:06:18.250,00:06:24.380
Let me swap the labels.,00:06:24.380,00:06:25.690
"Let me just say that bj is equal
to b1, and that b1 is",00:06:25.690,00:06:29.860
equal to bj.,00:06:29.860,00:06:30.660
I'm just swapping their names.,00:06:30.660,00:06:34.230
"I took that guy, I
renamed him b1.",00:06:34.230,00:06:36.590
"I renamed b1, bj, so that
I could swap them.",00:06:36.590,00:06:40.120
"So I'm essentially just going
to remove b1 one from the",00:06:40.120,00:06:42.610
"vector just to make my
notation easier.",00:06:42.610,00:06:44.210
"You could just keep saying I'll
remove this bj from the",00:06:44.210,00:06:46.490
"middle, but it becomes
very confusing then.",00:06:46.490,00:06:48.980
"So let me call my new set after
removing the bj that",00:06:48.980,00:06:53.150
"I've renamed as b1, let me just
call that straight up B1.",00:06:53.150,00:06:58.880
"So my straight set B1 is equal
to a1, and then remember I",00:06:58.880,00:07:06.470
"removed the bj and I renamed
that as b1, and then I",00:07:06.470,00:07:09.100
renamed b1 as bj.,00:07:09.100,00:07:10.380
"So now my set looks like
this -- let me go",00:07:10.380,00:07:12.840
to the other color.,00:07:12.840,00:07:14.900
"b2 -- and for all we know
bj might have been",00:07:14.900,00:07:18.130
"b1, we don't know.",00:07:18.130,00:07:20.830
"There are probably multiple of
these that are non-zero, so we",00:07:20.830,00:07:23.930
"could pick any of those
to be our bj.",00:07:23.930,00:07:26.480
"But anyway, we took our
bj renamed it b1,",00:07:26.480,00:07:30.150
and removed the b1.,00:07:30.150,00:07:31.590
"So now out set looks like this:
b3 all the way to bm.",00:07:31.590,00:07:36.130
This set still spans V.,00:07:39.320,00:07:44.100
"And we know that because the
guy we removed can be",00:07:44.100,00:07:47.230
"constructed with any linear
combination of these guys.",00:07:47.230,00:07:50.270
"So we haven't lost our ability
to construct all of the",00:07:50.270,00:07:53.130
vectors in V.,00:07:53.130,00:07:54.480
"Now let me create
another vector.",00:07:54.480,00:07:55.730
We'll do a new color.,00:07:59.420,00:08:01.160
"Let's say I have the
vector B2 prime.",00:08:01.160,00:08:05.430
"And what I'm going to do here
is now I'm going to take",00:08:05.430,00:08:07.110
"another element from
our basis of V.",00:08:07.110,00:08:10.700
"I'll take the second element;
I'll take a2.",00:08:10.700,00:08:13.560
"I'll take a2 and throw
it on this guy.",00:08:13.560,00:08:15.820
"So now we have the set B2 prime
is equal to -- I'm going",00:08:15.820,00:08:23.970
to add a2 to this guy.,00:08:23.970,00:08:25.220
"So you have a1, a2, and then you
have all the rest of these",00:08:25.220,00:08:31.090
"guys, b2, b3 all the way bm.",00:08:31.090,00:08:36.360
"Of course this still spans V,
I just added something here.",00:08:36.360,00:08:39.169
"But this is definitely
linearly dependent.",00:08:39.169,00:08:41.460
"Remember I didn't say in the
beginning whether this was",00:08:41.460,00:08:43.240
linear dependent or not.,00:08:43.240,00:08:44.710
It may or may not be.,00:08:44.710,00:08:45.700
"But when you add this other
vector that's in V, you",00:08:45.700,00:08:47.650
"definitely know that you're
linear dependent, because",00:08:47.650,00:08:49.490
"these guys can construct
that guy.",00:08:49.490,00:08:51.730
"Similarly we know that this
vector B1 spans V.",00:08:51.730,00:08:56.380
"So when we add this new element
here, we know that it",00:08:56.380,00:09:01.550
"can be written as a linear
combination of the other one.",00:09:01.550,00:09:03.950
"So we know that this right here
is linearly dependent.",00:09:03.950,00:09:06.940
"And we could say that a2 is
equal to some constant times",00:09:06.940,00:09:12.770
"c1 times a1 plus c2 b2 plus c3
b3, all the way to cm bm.",00:09:12.770,00:09:28.260
"Now what I'm going to claim is
that at least one of these",00:09:28.260,00:09:32.240
coefficients is non-zero.,00:09:32.240,00:09:33.610
"So at least one of the ci's
does not equal to 0.",00:09:33.610,00:09:37.160
"And I'll make the further claim
that there's at least",00:09:37.160,00:09:40.800
"one that's outside
of this one.",00:09:40.800,00:09:43.170
"That at least one of the
coefficients on these B terms",00:09:46.440,00:09:50.670
has to be non-zero.,00:09:50.670,00:09:52.230
"And the way you can think about
is, what if all of these",00:09:52.230,00:09:55.350
guys were 0?,00:09:55.350,00:09:56.750
"If all of these guys were 0,
then that means that a2 is a",00:09:56.750,00:10:00.070
linear combination of a1.,00:10:00.070,00:10:01.490
"All of these guys would cancel
out, and you'd have a2 is",00:10:01.490,00:10:03.640
"equal to some non-zero
constant times a1.",00:10:03.640,00:10:06.440
"We know that's not the case
because these two guys come",00:10:06.440,00:10:09.440
"from the same linearly
independent set.",00:10:09.440,00:10:13.630
"They both come from that
spanning basis.",00:10:13.630,00:10:17.150
"The fact that they are a basis
-- the word spanning basis, I",00:10:17.150,00:10:20.180
"shouldn't say it like that,
because it's redundant.",00:10:20.180,00:10:21.600
"A basis is a spanning set that
is linearly independent.",00:10:21.600,00:10:25.710
"If they're linearly independent
we know that a2",00:10:25.710,00:10:28.140
"cannot be represented as some
linear combination of the rest",00:10:28.140,00:10:31.240
of these guys.,00:10:31.240,00:10:32.310
"So we know that one of the
coefficients on the B terms",00:10:32.310,00:10:37.710
has to be non-zero.,00:10:37.710,00:10:39.780
"And let's just say that you're
going to have a cj bj, this is",00:10:39.780,00:10:46.170
"a different one than
we had before.",00:10:46.170,00:10:47.930
"And we know that this guy, at
least one of them has to be",00:10:47.930,00:10:51.760
"non-zero, because if all of
these guys were non-zero, then",00:10:51.760,00:10:54.760
"you wouldn't be able to say
that this vector and that",00:10:54.760,00:10:56.910
"vector are linearly independent,
because they",00:10:56.910,00:10:58.780
"would be scalar multiples
of each other.",00:10:58.780,00:11:00.900
"So we're going to do
the same exercise.",00:11:00.900,00:11:03.050
"This guy right here, cj bj,
obviously this coefficient is",00:11:03.050,00:11:12.600
"non-zero so we can
solve for our bj.",00:11:12.600,00:11:14.920
"Once again we can say that bj is
equal minus 1 over cj times",00:11:14.920,00:11:20.500
"minus a2 plus c1 a1, all
the way to cm bm.",00:11:20.500,00:11:28.070
"So we have some bj here that can
be represented as a linear",00:11:28.070,00:11:31.860
"combination of the rest of the
people, including our new a2.",00:11:31.860,00:11:35.420
"And so, just like we did before,
let's remove him.",00:11:35.420,00:11:38.250
Let's take him out of the set.,00:11:38.250,00:11:39.640
"And before I take him
out of the set, I'm",00:11:39.640,00:11:41.290
going to rename him.,00:11:41.290,00:11:42.230
"Just solely for the purpose of
notational simplicity, I'm",00:11:42.230,00:11:46.750
"just going to rename our bj, b2,
and our b2 is equal to bj.",00:11:46.750,00:11:51.770
"So I'm just rearranging
the names.",00:11:51.770,00:11:53.600
"And I'm going to
remove our b2.",00:11:53.600,00:11:56.380
"Or I'm going to remove
what I now call b2.",00:11:56.380,00:11:58.700
"It was whatever was out here
that could be represented as a",00:11:58.700,00:12:02.260
"linear combination of
everything else,",00:12:02.260,00:12:04.340
including our new a2.,00:12:04.340,00:12:05.590
"When I remove one of those
terms right here, and I",00:12:08.290,00:12:14.000
renamed it B2.,00:12:14.000,00:12:15.250
"And now it's equal to a1
a2, and now I have the",00:12:18.210,00:12:25.670
leftovers of my b's.,00:12:25.670,00:12:28.030
"So I have b3, b4, all
the way to bm.",00:12:28.030,00:12:33.290
"Notice I still have exactly
m elements, and",00:12:33.290,00:12:36.780
this still spans V.,00:12:36.780,00:12:40.410
"It spans V because the element
that I took out of it can be",00:12:40.410,00:12:43.870
"represented as a linear
combination of these guys.",00:12:43.870,00:12:46.650
"So if I ever want to construct
anything that need that, I can",00:12:46.650,00:12:48.780
construct that vector with some,00:12:48.780,00:12:50.750
combination of these guys.,00:12:50.750,00:12:51.610
So it wasn't necessary.,00:12:51.610,00:12:52.780
It still spans V.,00:12:52.780,00:12:54.460
"So this process I'm doing, I
can just keep repeating it.",00:12:54.460,00:12:57.300
I can add an a3.,00:12:57.300,00:13:00.700
I can define B3 prime.,00:13:00.700,00:13:04.600
"I can just add a3 to this
set right here, a2 a3.",00:13:04.600,00:13:09.960
"And then I have my b3, b4,
all the way to bm.",00:13:09.960,00:13:17.350
"And I'll say this is linearly
dependent because",00:13:17.350,00:13:21.050
this guy spans V.,00:13:21.050,00:13:22.830
"So everything but this
guy spans V.",00:13:22.830,00:13:25.130
"So obviously you can construct
this guy with a linear",00:13:25.130,00:13:27.750
"combination of the
rest of them.",00:13:27.750,00:13:29.460
"So you could say a3 is equal to
sum a1 plus sum a2 plus c3",00:13:29.460,00:13:37.610
"b3, all the way to cm bm.",00:13:37.610,00:13:41.670
"And we know that at least one
of the coefficients on the B",00:13:41.670,00:13:44.310
terms has to be non-zero.,00:13:44.310,00:13:48.190
"Because if all of those were
0, then you would be saying",00:13:48.190,00:13:51.040
"that a3 could be a linear
combination of the A terms.",00:13:51.040,00:13:54.060
"And we know that a3 can't be
a representative linear",00:13:54.060,00:13:57.640
"combination of the A terms,
because all these a terms come",00:13:57.640,00:14:00.570
"from a linearly independent
set.",00:14:00.570,00:14:02.900
So you do the same operation.,00:14:02.900,00:14:06.430
Let's say that cj is non-zero.,00:14:06.430,00:14:12.430
"Then you could solve
for that bj.",00:14:12.430,00:14:14.550
"And then I do that little
renaming thing I do, where I",00:14:14.550,00:14:17.650
"rename the bj b3, and rename b3
bj, and then I remove b3.",00:14:17.650,00:14:21.220
"And I get the set B3 is
equal to a1, a2, a3.",00:14:24.100,00:14:31.840
"And I have b4 all
the way to bm.",00:14:31.840,00:14:35.750
And this still spans V.,00:14:35.750,00:14:39.200
And I keep doing it.,00:14:39.200,00:14:40.640
"So what's going to happen
eventually?",00:14:40.640,00:14:42.500
"What's going to happen if I keep
doing this process over",00:14:42.500,00:14:46.210
and over and over again?,00:14:46.210,00:14:48.600
"Eventually I'll essentially
replace all of the bm's.",00:14:48.600,00:14:53.460
"Or I'll replace all of the n
terms, so eventually I'll have",00:14:53.460,00:14:56.730
a set that looks like this.,00:14:56.730,00:14:58.580
"I'll have a set that looks Bm,
where I will have replaced",00:14:58.580,00:15:02.470
each of these guys with an a.,00:15:02.470,00:15:04.150
"So I have a1, a2, a3,
all the way to am.",00:15:07.060,00:15:12.480
"You can always do this by
definition if you started with",00:15:12.480,00:15:15.330
"that initial set B that
is a spanning set.",00:15:15.330,00:15:17.850
"And once you do this process
you'll get the same result",00:15:17.850,00:15:20.345
that this also spans V.,00:15:20.345,00:15:24.090
Now let me let me write this.,00:15:24.090,00:15:25.440
"This is the result we got by
starting off with a spanning",00:15:25.440,00:15:28.890
"set B that has m elements,
where we said that m",00:15:28.890,00:15:34.490
is less than n.,00:15:34.490,00:15:36.190
"So we always have enough a
elements to do this, because",00:15:36.190,00:15:38.530
"we have more a elements
than there were b",00:15:38.530,00:15:40.260
elements to begin with.,00:15:40.260,00:15:41.450
"And we get result that
this spans V.",00:15:41.450,00:15:44.370
"But we already said that the
set A which is equal to a1,",00:15:44.370,00:15:51.840
"a2, all the way to am, and then
am plus 1, I don't know",00:15:51.840,00:16:00.430
"how many more terms there are
between m and n, but then you",00:16:00.430,00:16:02.580
go all the way to an.,00:16:02.580,00:16:03.610
"Remember we said that
n is greater than m.",00:16:03.610,00:16:07.000
"Or when we defined B, we said
that m is less than n.",00:16:07.000,00:16:10.610
"Same thing, that this
was a smaller set.",00:16:10.610,00:16:12.990
"Now we're saying that this spans
V, but at the same time",00:16:12.990,00:16:16.380
we said this was a basis.,00:16:16.380,00:16:18.990
"This is just our starting
fact, that this",00:16:18.990,00:16:20.880
is a basis for V.,00:16:20.880,00:16:24.410
"Basis means two things: it means
it spans V and it means",00:16:24.410,00:16:28.900
it's linearly independent.,00:16:28.900,00:16:30.910
"Now we just got this result by
assuming that we had some set",00:16:30.910,00:16:35.430
"B that's smaller than this
set here that spans V.",00:16:35.430,00:16:38.100
"We were able to construct this
by saying that a1 through am",00:16:38.100,00:16:41.420
also spans V.,00:16:41.420,00:16:44.350
"The result we got is
that this spans V.",00:16:44.350,00:16:48.250
"But if this subset of A spans
V, then A becomes linearly",00:16:48.250,00:16:53.440
independent.,00:16:53.440,00:16:53.900
"Because if this subset spans V,
that means that an can be",00:16:53.900,00:17:00.260
"represented as some linear
combination of these guys.",00:17:00.260,00:17:05.240
"So that implies that you're
linearly dependent, which is a",00:17:05.240,00:17:08.560
"contradiction with our original
statement that set A",00:17:08.560,00:17:12.300
"is a basis for V, because
that means it's linearly",00:17:12.300,00:17:14.839
independent.,00:17:14.839,00:17:15.869
"If you're able to do this, then
this means that there was",00:17:15.869,00:17:18.810
"some smaller spanning set, you
get the result that A has to",00:17:18.810,00:17:22.390
"be linearly dependant, even
though we said it was linearly",00:17:22.390,00:17:24.589
independent.,00:17:24.589,00:17:25.700
"So we now know, we get our
contradiction, we say that",00:17:25.700,00:17:28.860
there cannot be [typing],00:17:28.860,00:17:30.580
"a spanning set B that has
fewer elements than A.",00:17:43.480,00:17:59.640
"And this is a pretty neat
outcome, because now, if I",00:17:59.640,00:18:05.010
"come up to you and say I
found some set X spans",00:18:05.010,00:18:12.160
the subspace V again.,00:18:12.160,00:18:16.960
"Then you know that X
has five elements.",00:18:16.960,00:18:22.550
"You now know that no set that
spans the subspace V can have",00:18:22.550,00:18:26.870
fewer than five elements.,00:18:26.870,00:18:28.560
"Even better, if I told you that
X is a basis for V, and I",00:18:28.560,00:18:36.230
"told you it has five elements,
and Y is a basis for V.",00:18:36.230,00:18:42.370
[typing],00:18:42.370,00:18:43.620
"You know that Y also has to have
exactly five elements.",00:18:58.130,00:19:01.320
How do I know that?,00:19:05.460,00:19:07.310
"Well, if Y is a basis, then that
means that it spans V.",00:19:07.310,00:19:13.450
"And we know it can't
have anything",00:19:13.450,00:19:15.000
less than five elements.,00:19:15.000,00:19:16.310
We just proved that.,00:19:16.310,00:19:18.450
"One way we know that Y has to
have greater than or equal to",00:19:18.450,00:19:21.380
five elements.,00:19:21.380,00:19:23.730
"But on the other hand we know if
Y is a basis for V and X is",00:19:23.730,00:19:30.430
"a basis, X also spans V.",00:19:30.430,00:19:32.590
"So we know that X has to have
fewer elements than Y.",00:19:32.590,00:19:35.360
So we know that [typing],00:19:35.360,00:19:37.395
"Y's elements have to be greater
than X's elements,",00:19:40.060,00:19:49.010
"because any spanning set has to
have more elements, or at",00:19:49.010,00:19:52.170
"least as many elements, as a
basis set, X's elements.",00:19:52.170,00:19:58.170
"And then since X is a spanning
set, X's elements have to be",00:19:58.170,00:20:03.570
"greater than or equal
to Y's elements,",00:20:03.570,00:20:05.310
because why is a basis.,00:20:05.310,00:20:06.560
"But if this guy's elements are
less than this guy's elements,",00:20:11.650,00:20:15.530
"but it's also greater than or
equal to, we know that the",00:20:15.530,00:20:19.250
"number of elements that X has--
X's elements, or the",00:20:19.250,00:20:23.190
"cardinality or the number of
elements in it --is equal to",00:20:23.190,00:20:26.180
Y's elements.,00:20:26.180,00:20:27.430
"And so now that we know that any
basis for a vector space--",00:20:30.200,00:20:39.190
"Let me just go back
to our set A.",00:20:39.190,00:20:40.610
"A is equal to a1 a2,
all the way to an.",00:20:40.610,00:20:45.080
"We can now say that any basis
for some vector, for some",00:20:45.080,00:20:51.040
"subspace V, they all have the
same number of elements.",00:20:51.040,00:20:54.700
"And so we can define a
new term called the",00:20:54.700,00:20:57.770
dimension of V.,00:20:57.770,00:21:03.510
"Sometimes it's written just as
dimension of V, is equal to",00:21:03.510,00:21:07.270
"the number of elements,
sometimes called the",00:21:07.270,00:21:10.530
"cardinality, of any
basis of V.",00:21:10.530,00:21:17.670
"And I went through great pains
in this video to show that any",00:21:17.670,00:21:19.880
"basis of V all has the same
number of elements, so this is",00:21:19.880,00:21:22.740
well-defined.,00:21:22.740,00:21:23.870
"You can't have one basis that
has five elements and",00:21:23.870,00:21:26.120
one that has six.,00:21:26.120,00:21:26.900
"By definition they would either
both have to have five,",00:21:26.900,00:21:28.920
"or they both would
have to have six.",00:21:28.920,00:21:30.520
"And so we can define
our dimensionality.",00:21:30.520,00:21:32.550
