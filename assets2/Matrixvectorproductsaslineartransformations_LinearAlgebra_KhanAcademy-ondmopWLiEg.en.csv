"I think you're pretty familiar
with the idea of matrix vector",00:00:00.720,00:00:04.350
"products and what I want to do
in this video is show you that",00:00:04.350,00:00:07.860
"taking a product of a vector
with a matrix is equivalent to",00:00:07.860,00:00:12.440
a transformation.,00:00:12.440,00:00:13.490
"It's actually a linear
transformation.",00:00:13.490,00:00:16.020
"Let's say we have some matrix A
and let's say that its terms",00:00:16.020,00:00:20.630
"are, or its columns are v1--
column vector is v2,",00:00:20.630,00:00:26.870
all the way to vn.,00:00:26.870,00:00:29.130
So this guy has n columns.,00:00:29.130,00:00:31.490
Let's say it has m rows.,00:00:31.490,00:00:32.780
So it's an m by n matrix.,00:00:32.780,00:00:36.260
"And let's say I define
some transformation.",00:00:36.260,00:00:38.126
"Let's say my transformation
goes from Rn to Rm.",00:00:42.500,00:00:51.380
This is the domain.,00:00:51.380,00:00:52.300
"I can take any vector in Rn
and it will map it to some",00:00:52.300,00:00:56.650
factor in Rm.,00:00:56.650,00:00:57.730
And I define my transformation.,00:00:57.730,00:00:59.650
"So T of x where this is some
vector in Rn, is equal to A--",00:00:59.650,00:01:06.990
this is this A.,00:01:06.990,00:01:09.050
"Let me write it in this
color right here.",00:01:09.050,00:01:11.040
And it should be bolded.,00:01:11.040,00:01:12.120
"I kind of get careless sometimes
with the bolding.",00:01:12.120,00:01:14.590
"But big bold A times
the vector x.",00:01:14.590,00:01:18.370
"So the first thing you might,
Sal, this transformation looks",00:01:18.370,00:01:22.150
"very odd relative to how we've
been defining transformations",00:01:22.150,00:01:25.510
or functions so far.,00:01:25.510,00:01:26.830
"So the first thing we have to
just feel comfortable with is",00:01:26.830,00:01:29.770
"the idea that this is
a transformation.",00:01:29.770,00:01:31.680
So what are we doing?,00:01:31.680,00:01:32.430
"We're taking something
from Rn and then",00:01:32.430,00:01:35.530
what does A x produce?,00:01:35.530,00:01:36.780
"If we write A x like this, if
this is x where it's x1, x2.",00:01:41.430,00:01:45.220
"It's going to have n terms
because it's in Rn.",00:01:45.220,00:01:49.220
"This can be rewritten as x1
times v1 plus x2 times v2, all",00:01:49.220,00:01:56.760
the way to xn times vn.,00:01:56.760,00:02:00.690
"So it's going to be a sum of a
bunch of these column vectors.",00:02:00.690,00:02:04.280
"And each of these columns
vectors, v1, v2, all the way",00:02:04.280,00:02:09.100
"to vn, what set are
they members of?",00:02:09.100,00:02:12.670
"This is an m by n matrix, so
they're going to have m-- the",00:02:12.670,00:02:16.280
"matrix has m rows, or
each of these column",00:02:16.280,00:02:18.620
vectors will have m entries.,00:02:18.620,00:02:20.720
"So all of these guys
are members of Rm.",00:02:20.720,00:02:23.430
"So if I just take a linear
combination of all of these",00:02:23.430,00:02:25.870
"guys, I'm going to get
another member of Rm.",00:02:25.870,00:02:30.310
"So this guy right here is going
to be a member of Rm,",00:02:30.310,00:02:33.440
another vector.,00:02:33.440,00:02:34.540
"So clearly, by multiplying my
vector x times a, I'm mapping,",00:02:34.540,00:02:39.590
"I'm creating a mapping from Rn--
and let me pick another",00:02:39.590,00:02:46.840
color-- to Rm.,00:02:46.840,00:02:50.780
"And I'm saying it in very
general terms. Maybe n is 3,",00:02:50.780,00:02:53.640
maybe m is 5.,00:02:53.640,00:02:54.810
Who knows?,00:02:54.810,00:02:55.300
"But I'm saying it in very
general terms. And so if this",00:02:55.300,00:02:58.225
"is a particular instance, a
particular member of set Rn,",00:02:58.225,00:03:03.340
"so it's that vector, our
transformation or our function",00:03:03.340,00:03:06.800
"is going to map it to
this guy right here.",00:03:06.800,00:03:09.910
"And this guy will be a
member of Rm and we",00:03:09.910,00:03:12.290
could call him a x.,00:03:12.290,00:03:14.570
"Or maybe if we said a x equaled
b we could call him",00:03:14.570,00:03:16.660
the vector b-- whatever.,00:03:16.660,00:03:18.150
"But this is our transformation
mapping.",00:03:18.150,00:03:20.460
"So this does fit our kind of
definition or our terminology",00:03:20.460,00:03:27.540
"for a function or a
transformation as a mapping",00:03:27.540,00:03:30.480
from one set to another.,00:03:30.480,00:03:31.760
"But it still might not be
satisfying because everything",00:03:31.760,00:03:34.490
"we saw before looked
kind of like this.",00:03:34.490,00:03:36.900
"If we had a transformation
I would write it like the",00:03:36.900,00:03:39.690
"transformation of-- I would
write, you know, x1 and x2 and",00:03:39.690,00:03:45.040
xn is equal to.,00:03:45.040,00:03:47.100
"I'd write m terms
here in commas.",00:03:50.670,00:03:54.450
How does this relate to that?,00:03:54.450,00:03:55.740
"And to do that I'll do
a specific example.",00:03:55.740,00:03:58.480
"So let's say that I had
the matrix-- let me",00:03:58.480,00:04:03.680
to a different letter.,00:04:03.680,00:04:04.690
"Let's say I have my matrix
B and it is a",00:04:04.690,00:04:08.270
fairly simple matrix.,00:04:08.270,00:04:09.290
"It's a 2, minus 1, 3 and 4.",00:04:09.290,00:04:13.780
"And I define some
transformation.",00:04:13.780,00:04:16.211
"So I define some transformation
T.",00:04:16.211,00:04:20.959
And it goes from R2 to R2.,00:04:20.959,00:04:26.540
And I define T.,00:04:26.540,00:04:28.080
"T of some vector x is equal
to this matrix, B",00:04:28.080,00:04:34.270
times that vector x.,00:04:34.270,00:04:36.260
Now what would that equal?,00:04:36.260,00:04:37.830
"Well the matrix is
right there.",00:04:37.830,00:04:40.850
Let me write it in purple.,00:04:40.850,00:04:42.310
"2, minus 1, 3, and 4 times x.",00:04:42.310,00:04:48.570
"x1, x2.",00:04:48.570,00:04:51.130
And so what does this equal?,00:04:51.130,00:04:53.390
"Well this equals
another vector.",00:04:53.390,00:04:55.310
"It equals a vector in the
co-domain R2 where the first",00:04:55.310,00:04:58.600
term is 2 times x1.,00:04:58.600,00:05:00.290
"I'm just doing the definition
of matrix vector",00:05:00.290,00:05:02.770
multiplication.,00:05:02.770,00:05:03.310
"2 times x1 plus minus 1
times x2, or minus x2.",00:05:03.310,00:05:10.840
"That's that row times
our vector.",00:05:10.840,00:05:13.660
"And then the second row
times that factor.",00:05:13.660,00:05:15.570
We get 3 times x1.,00:05:15.570,00:05:17.910
Plus 4 times x2.,00:05:20.530,00:05:22.210
"So this is what we might
be more familiar with.",00:05:24.980,00:05:27.520
"I could rewrite this
transformation.",00:05:27.520,00:05:29.530
"I could rewrite this
transformation as T of x1 x2",00:05:29.530,00:05:36.130
"is equal to 2x1 minus x2 comma--
let me scroll over a",00:05:36.130,00:05:42.780
"little bit, comma
3x1 plus 4x2.",00:05:42.780,00:05:48.490
"So hopefully you're satisfied
that a matrix multiplication,",00:05:48.490,00:05:51.100
"it isn't some new, exotic
form of transformation.",00:05:51.100,00:05:54.770
"That they really are
just another way.",00:05:54.770,00:05:58.010
"This statement right here is
just another way of writing",00:05:58.010,00:06:02.590
"this exact transformation
right here.",00:06:02.590,00:06:06.480
"Now, the next question you might
ask and I already told",00:06:06.480,00:06:08.490
"you the answer to this at the
beginning of the video is, is",00:06:08.490,00:06:11.400
"multiplication by a matrix
always going to be a linear",00:06:11.400,00:06:15.510
transformation?,00:06:15.510,00:06:16.800
"Now what are the two constraints
for being a linear",00:06:16.800,00:06:18.730
transformation?,00:06:18.730,00:06:20.390
"We know that the transformation
of two vectors,",00:06:20.390,00:06:25.000
"a plus b, the sum of two vectors
should be equal to the",00:06:25.000,00:06:29.290
sum of their transformations.,00:06:29.290,00:06:30.826
"The transformation of a plus
the transformation of b.",00:06:30.826,00:06:34.770
"And then the other requirement
is that the transformation of",00:06:34.770,00:06:38.135
"a scaled version of a vector
should be equal to a scaled",00:06:38.135,00:06:42.180
version of the transformation.,00:06:42.180,00:06:43.670
"These are our two requirements
for being a linear",00:06:43.670,00:06:47.500
transformation.,00:06:47.500,00:06:48.390
"So let's see if matrix
multiplication applies there.",00:06:48.390,00:06:51.300
"And I've touched on this in the
past and I've even told",00:06:51.300,00:06:53.210
you that you should prove it.,00:06:53.210,00:06:56.130
"I've already assumed you know
it, but I'll prove it to you",00:06:56.130,00:06:58.000
"here because I'm tired of
telling you that you",00:06:58.000,00:06:59.630
should prove it.,00:06:59.630,00:07:00.120
I should do it at least once.,00:07:00.120,00:07:01.500
"So let's see, matrix
multiplication.",00:07:01.500,00:07:03.090
"If I multiply a matrix A times
some vector x, we know that--",00:07:03.090,00:07:11.220
let me write it this way.,00:07:11.220,00:07:12.780
We know that this is equivalent,00:07:12.780,00:07:14.120
to-- I said our matrix.,00:07:14.120,00:07:16.270
"Let's say this is an
m by n matrix.",00:07:16.270,00:07:18.540
"We can write any matrix
as just a",00:07:18.540,00:07:20.000
series of column vectors.,00:07:20.000,00:07:21.240
"So this guy could have
n column vectors.",00:07:21.240,00:07:23.760
"So let's say it's v1, v2, all
the way to vn column vectors.",00:07:23.760,00:07:30.700
"And each of these guys are going
to have m components.",00:07:30.700,00:07:33.050
"Times x1, x2, all the
way down to xn.",00:07:33.050,00:07:37.880
"And we've seen this multiple,
multiple times before.",00:07:37.880,00:07:40.740
"This, by the definition of
matrix vector multiplication",00:07:40.740,00:07:43.790
is equal to x1 times v1.,00:07:43.790,00:07:47.820
That times that.,00:07:47.820,00:07:49.080
"This scalar times that vector
plus x2 times v2, all the way",00:07:49.080,00:07:54.270
to plus xn times vn.,00:07:54.270,00:07:57.270
"This was by definition of a
matrix vector multiplication.",00:07:57.270,00:08:01.650
"And of course, this is going
to-- and I did this at the top",00:08:01.650,00:08:03.630
of the video.,00:08:03.630,00:08:04.160
"This is going to have right
here, this vector is going to",00:08:04.160,00:08:07.540
be a member of Rm.,00:08:07.540,00:08:09.310
"It's going to have
m components.",00:08:09.310,00:08:11.920
"So what happens if I take some
matrix A, some m by n matrix",00:08:11.920,00:08:19.520
"A, and I multiply it times the
sum of two vectors a plus b?",00:08:19.520,00:08:30.450
"So I could rewrite this as
this thing right here.",00:08:30.450,00:08:33.100
So my matrix A times.,00:08:33.100,00:08:34.880
"The sum of a plus b, the first
term will just be a1 plus b1.",00:08:34.880,00:08:38.309
"Second term is a2 plus b2, all
the way down to a n plus bn.",00:08:38.309,00:08:45.460
"This is the same
thing as this.",00:08:45.460,00:08:46.720
I'm not saying a of a plus b.,00:08:46.720,00:08:48.290
I'm saying a times.,00:08:48.290,00:08:50.260
"Maybe I should put a
dot right there.",00:08:50.260,00:08:51.920
I'm multiplying the matrix.,00:08:51.920,00:08:54.760
"I want to be careful
with my notation.",00:08:54.760,00:08:56.000
"This is the matrix vector
multiplication.",00:08:56.000,00:08:58.110
"It's not some type of new
matrix dot product.",00:08:58.110,00:09:00.940
"But this is the same
thing as this",00:09:00.940,00:09:02.450
multiplication right here.,00:09:02.450,00:09:03.660
"And based on what I just told
you up here, which we've seen",00:09:03.660,00:09:06.060
"multiple, multiple times, this
is the same thing as a1 plus",00:09:06.060,00:09:11.780
"b1 times the first column
in a, which is that",00:09:11.780,00:09:15.960
vector right there.,00:09:15.960,00:09:16.890
This a is the same as this a.,00:09:16.890,00:09:18.560
So times v1.,00:09:18.560,00:09:20.130
"Plus a2 plus b2 times v2,
all the way to plus an",00:09:20.130,00:09:28.820
plus bn times vn.,00:09:28.820,00:09:31.180
"Each xi term here is just
being replaced by",00:09:33.770,00:09:35.840
an ai plus bi term.,00:09:35.840,00:09:37.850
"So each x1 here is replaced
by an a1 plus b1 here.",00:09:37.850,00:09:41.910
This is equivalent to this.,00:09:41.910,00:09:44.090
"And then from the fact that we
know that well vector products",00:09:44.090,00:09:51.440
"times scalars exhibit the
distributive property, we can",00:09:51.440,00:09:54.700
"say that this is equal
to a1 times v1.",00:09:54.700,00:10:00.290
"Let me actually write all of
the a1 terms. Let me write",00:10:00.290,00:10:02.710
"this. a1 times v1 plus b1 times
v1 plus a2 times v2 plus",00:10:02.710,00:10:10.230
"b2 times v2, all the way
to plus a n times vn",00:10:10.230,00:10:15.460
plus bn times vn.,00:10:15.460,00:10:19.170
"And then if we just re-associate
this, if we just",00:10:19.170,00:10:21.910
"group all of the a's together,
all of the a terms together,",00:10:21.910,00:10:25.890
we get a1 plus a-- sorry.,00:10:25.890,00:10:29.440
"a1 plus-- let me write it this
way. a1 times v1 plus a2 times",00:10:29.440,00:10:35.870
"v2 plus, all the way,
a n times vn.",00:10:35.870,00:10:40.870
"I just grabbed all
the a terms.",00:10:40.870,00:10:43.640
"We get that plus all the b
terms. All the b terms I'll do",00:10:43.640,00:10:47.550
in this color.,00:10:47.550,00:10:48.500
All the b terms are like that.,00:10:48.500,00:10:50.310
"So plus b1 times v1 plus b2
times v2, all the way to plus",00:10:50.310,00:10:57.850
bn times vn.,00:10:57.850,00:10:59.560
That's that guy right there.,00:10:59.560,00:11:01.640
"Is equivalent to this statement
up here; I just",00:11:01.640,00:11:03.340
"regrouped everything, which is
of course, equivalent to that",00:11:03.340,00:11:05.240
statement over there.,00:11:05.240,00:11:06.780
But what's this equal to?,00:11:06.780,00:11:08.770
"This is equal to my vector--
these columns are remember,",00:11:08.770,00:11:15.210
"the column for the
matrix capital A.",00:11:15.210,00:11:17.160
"So this is equal to the matrix
capital A times a1, a2, all",00:11:17.160,00:11:22.780
"the way down to a n, which
was our vector a.",00:11:22.780,00:11:26.650
And what's this equal to?,00:11:26.650,00:11:28.020
"This is equal to plus
these v1's.",00:11:28.020,00:11:30.700
"These are the columns for the a,
so it's equal to the matrix",00:11:30.700,00:11:32.720
A times my vector b.,00:11:32.720,00:11:36.440
"b1, b2, all the way
down to bn.",00:11:36.440,00:11:41.140
This is my vector b.,00:11:41.140,00:11:45.140
"We just showed you that if I add
my two vectors, a and b,",00:11:45.140,00:11:48.260
"and then multiply it by the
matrix, it's completely",00:11:48.260,00:11:50.970
"equivalent to multiplying each
of the vectors times the",00:11:50.970,00:11:54.620
"matrix first and then
adding them up.",00:11:54.620,00:11:56.850
"So we've satisfied-- and this
is for an m by n matrix.",00:11:56.850,00:12:01.620
"So we've now satisfied this
first condition right there.",00:12:01.620,00:12:08.470
"And then what about the
second condition?",00:12:08.470,00:12:09.980
"And this one's even more
straightforward to understand.",00:12:09.980,00:12:13.080
"c times a1, so let me
write it this way.",00:12:13.080,00:12:18.420
The vector a times-- sorry.,00:12:18.420,00:12:21.200
"The matrix capital A times the
vector lowercase a-- let me do",00:12:21.200,00:12:25.260
"it this way because
I want-- times the",00:12:25.260,00:12:27.495
vector c lowercase a.,00:12:27.495,00:12:29.650
"So I'm multiplying my vector
times the scalar first. Is",00:12:29.650,00:12:32.940
"equal to-- I can write
my big matrix A.",00:12:32.940,00:12:36.530
"I've already labeled
its columns.",00:12:36.530,00:12:38.210
"It's v1, v2, all
the way to vn.",00:12:38.210,00:12:42.800
That's my matrix a.,00:12:42.800,00:12:44.780
"And then, what does
ca look like?",00:12:44.780,00:12:47.510
"ca, you just multiply its
scalar times each of",00:12:47.510,00:12:49.680
the terms of a.,00:12:49.680,00:12:50.530
"So it's ca1, ca2, all the
way down to c a n.",00:12:50.530,00:12:56.940
And what does this equal?,00:12:56.940,00:12:58.270
"We know this, we've seen this
show multiple times before",00:12:58.270,00:13:01.020
right there.,00:13:01.020,00:13:02.230
"So it just equals-- I'll write
a little bit lower.",00:13:02.230,00:13:06.670
"That equals c a1 times this
column vector, times v1.",00:13:06.670,00:13:13.000
"Plus c a2 times v2 times this
guy, all the way to",00:13:13.000,00:13:22.010
plus c a n times vn.,00:13:22.010,00:13:26.570
"And if you just factor this
c out, once again, scalar",00:13:31.490,00:13:34.460
"multiplication times vectors
exhibits the",00:13:34.460,00:13:37.230
distributive property.,00:13:37.230,00:13:38.530
"I believe I've done a video
on that, but it's",00:13:38.530,00:13:40.420
very easy to prove.,00:13:40.420,00:13:41.700
"So this will be equal to c
times-- I'll just stay in one",00:13:41.700,00:13:44.960
"color right now-- a1 v1
plus a2 v2 plus all",00:13:44.960,00:13:51.210
the way to a n vn.,00:13:51.210,00:13:54.600
"And what is this
thing equal to?",00:13:54.600,00:13:56.400
"Well that's just our matrix A
times our vector-- or our",00:13:56.400,00:14:03.770
matrix uppercase A.,00:14:03.770,00:14:05.040
"Maybe I'm overloading
the letter A.",00:14:05.040,00:14:06.970
"My matrix uppercase A times
my vector lowercase a.",00:14:06.970,00:14:10.470
"Where the lowercase a is just
this thing right here, a1, a2",00:14:14.750,00:14:18.210
and so forth.,00:14:18.210,00:14:18.700
"This thing up here was the
same thing as that.",00:14:18.700,00:14:20.320
"So I just showed you that if I
take my matrix and multiply it",00:14:20.320,00:14:23.680
"times some vector that was
multiplied by a scalar first,",00:14:23.680,00:14:27.020
"that's equivalent to first
multiplying the matrix times a",00:14:27.020,00:14:30.190
"vector and then multiplying
by the scalar.",00:14:30.190,00:14:33.310
"So we've shown you that matrix
times vector products or",00:14:33.310,00:14:39.020
"matrix vector products satisfied
this condition of",00:14:39.020,00:14:41.880
"linear transformations
and this condition.",00:14:41.880,00:14:45.320
"So the big takeaway right here
is matrix multiplication.",00:14:45.320,00:14:49.680
"And this is a important
takeaway.",00:14:49.680,00:14:51.580
"Matrix multiplication or matrix
products with vectors",00:14:54.620,00:15:03.570
"is always a linear
transformation.",00:15:03.570,00:15:08.475
"And this is a bit
of a side note.",00:15:11.200,00:15:12.540
"In the next video I'm going to
show you that any linear",00:15:12.540,00:15:14.710
"transformation-- this is
incredibly powerful-- can be",00:15:14.710,00:15:17.460
"represented by a matrix
product or by-- any",00:15:17.460,00:15:22.260
"transformation on any vector can
be equivalently, I guess,",00:15:22.260,00:15:25.410
"written as a product of that
vector with a matrix.",00:15:25.410,00:15:28.600
"Has huge repercussions and you
know, just as a side note,",00:15:28.600,00:15:31.640
"kind of tying this back
to your everyday life.",00:15:31.640,00:15:34.770
"You have your Xbox, your Sony
Playstation and you know, you",00:15:34.770,00:15:38.410
"have these 3D graphic programs
where you're running around",00:15:38.410,00:15:41.950
and shooting at things.,00:15:41.950,00:15:43.000
"And the way that the software
renders those programs where",00:15:43.000,00:15:46.980
"you can see things from every
different angle, you have a",00:15:46.980,00:15:49.160
"cube then if you kind of move
this way a little bit, the",00:15:49.160,00:15:53.100
"cube will look more like this
and it gets rotated, and you",00:15:53.100,00:15:56.070
"move up and down, these are all",00:15:56.070,00:15:57.780
transformations of matrices.,00:15:57.780,00:15:59.010
"And we'll do this
in more detail.",00:15:59.010,00:16:01.540
"These are all transformations of
vectors or the positions of",00:16:01.540,00:16:05.830
"vectors and I'll do that
in a lot more detail.",00:16:05.830,00:16:07.690
"And all of that is really just
matrix multiplication.",00:16:07.690,00:16:10.390
"So all of these things that
you're doing in your fancy 3D",00:16:10.390,00:16:13.130
"games on your Xbox or your
Playstation, they're all just",00:16:13.130,00:16:15.890
matrix multiplications.,00:16:15.890,00:16:16.800
"And I'm going to prove that
to you in the next video.",00:16:16.800,00:16:18.840
"And so when you have these
graphics cards or these",00:16:18.840,00:16:20.960
"graphics engines, all they are--
you know, we're jumping",00:16:20.960,00:16:25.420
away from the theoretical.,00:16:25.420,00:16:26.630
"But all these graphics
processors are, are hard wired",00:16:26.630,00:16:32.650
matrix multipliers.,00:16:32.650,00:16:34.270

some type of CPU, I have to in",00:16:34.270,00:16:37.970
"software write how to
multiply matrices.",00:16:37.970,00:16:40.230
"But if I'm making an Xbox or
something and 99% of what I'm",00:16:40.230,00:16:44.370

abstract objects and",00:16:44.370,00:16:48.150

ways, I should have a",00:16:48.150,00:16:51.550

chip, that all it does-- it's",00:16:51.550,00:16:55.590
"hard wired into it-- is
multiplying matrices.",00:16:55.590,00:16:58.620
