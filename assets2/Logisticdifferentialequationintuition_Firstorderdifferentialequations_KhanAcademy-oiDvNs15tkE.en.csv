"In the last video, we took a stab at",00:00:00.626,00:00:02.781
modeling population as a function of time.,00:00:02.781,00:00:05.572
"And we said, okay, well
maybe the rate of change",00:00:05.572,00:00:07.153
of population with respect to time,00:00:07.153,00:00:09.114
is going to be proportional to,00:00:09.114,00:00:10.649
the population itself.,00:00:10.649,00:00:11.885
That the rate will increase,00:00:11.915,00:00:13.573
as the population increases.,00:00:13.573,00:00:15.526
And when you actually try to solve,00:00:15.743,00:00:17.471
"this differential equation,",00:00:17.471,00:00:18.704
"you try to find an N of
T that satisfies this,",00:00:18.704,00:00:20.931
we found that an exponential would work.,00:00:20.931,00:00:22.902
"An exponential satisfies
this differential equation.",00:00:22.902,00:00:25.858
And it would look like this visually.,00:00:25.913,00:00:27.577
"It would look like this,",00:00:27.912,00:00:30.503
it would look like this visually.,00:00:30.645,00:00:32.450
"Where you're starting at
a population of N not,",00:00:32.045,00:00:33.987
"this is the time axis,",00:00:34.392,00:00:35.981
this is the population axis.,00:00:35.981,00:00:37.402
"And as time increases,",00:00:37.663,00:00:38.708
population increases exponentially.,00:00:39.113,00:00:41.122
Now we said there's an issue there.,00:00:41.709,00:00:43.182
What if Thomas Malthus is right?,00:00:43.359,00:00:45.430
That the environment can't support...,00:00:45.587,00:00:47.542
"let's say that the
environment can't support...",00:00:48.041,00:00:49.305
let me do this in a new color.,00:00:49.674,00:00:50.815
"Let's say that the environment
really can't support",00:00:50.815,00:00:53.118
"more than K, more than a population of K.",00:00:53.118,00:00:58.118
Then clearly the population can't just,00:01:02.252,00:01:04.263
go and go right through the ceiling.,00:01:04.372,00:01:06.676
"They're not going to be able to have food,",00:01:06.676,00:01:07.882
"or water or resources
or whatever it might be.",00:01:07.882,00:01:10.941
They might generate too much pollution.,00:01:11.472,00:01:12.323
Who knows what it might be.,00:01:12.323,00:01:13.278
"And so this first stab
at modeling population",00:01:13.278,00:01:18.147
doesn't quite do the trick.,00:01:18.147,00:01:19.445
"Especially if you are
kind of in Malthus's camp.",00:01:19.445,00:01:23.690
"And that's where PF, and once again",00:01:23.069,00:01:24.135
"I'm sure I'm mispronouncing the name,",00:01:24.756,00:01:26.522
"Verhulst is going to
come into the picture.",00:01:26.638,00:01:29.354
"Because he read Malthus's work,",00:01:29.354,00:01:30.680
"and said, ""Well yeah, I think
I can do a pretty good job",00:01:30.068,00:01:32.313
"""of modeling the type of behavior",00:01:32.925,00:01:35.197
"""that Malthus is talking about.""",00:01:35.197,00:01:37.116
And he says what we really want,00:01:37.362,00:01:39.763
is something...,00:01:41.104,00:01:43.288
"Let me write it, so the rate...",00:01:43.361,00:01:44.755
let's try to model.,00:01:44.922,00:01:45.805
"Let's set up another
differential equation.",00:01:45.805,00:01:47.444
"And now let's say okay,",00:01:50.975,00:01:52.800
"instead of, if N is substantially smaller",00:01:52.008,00:01:57.008
"than what the environment
can support, then yeah,",00:01:58.005,00:02:00.296
"that makes sense to
have exponential growth.",00:02:00.791,00:02:02.767
"But maybe we can dampen this,",00:02:06.719,00:02:09.479
or maybe we can bring this growth to zero,00:02:09.513,00:02:11.576
as N approaches K.,00:02:11.576,00:02:15.652
And so how can we actually modify this?,00:02:16.163,00:02:18.940
Maybe we can multiply it by something,00:02:18.094,00:02:19.589
"that for when N is small,",00:02:20.635,00:02:23.636
"when N is much smaller than K,",00:02:23.665,00:02:25.693
"this term right over here
is going to be close to one",00:02:25.892,00:02:28.407
"and when N is close to K,",00:02:28.567,00:02:30.396
this term is close to zero.,00:02:30.396,00:02:32.292
So let me write that.,00:02:32.292,00:02:33.139
"So these are our goals for
this term, right over here.",00:02:34.221,00:02:38.304
"When N is much smaller than K,",00:02:38.349,00:02:43.349
"so now the population is
not constrained at all,",00:02:51.008,00:02:52.541
people can have babies,00:02:53.333,00:02:54.275
and those babies can be fed,00:02:54.275,00:02:55.441
"and then they can have
babies, et cetera, et cetera,",00:02:55.441,00:02:57.474
then this thing should be close to one.,00:02:57.078,00:03:02.078
"And so then you have
essentially our old model.",00:03:02.914,00:03:05.220
"But then as N approaches K,",00:03:05.221,00:03:06.930
"then this thing should approach,",00:03:10.713,00:03:14.180
then this term or this expression,00:03:14.426,00:03:17.744
should approach zero.,00:03:17.744,00:03:19.438
And what that does is as N approaches,00:03:19.487,00:03:21.219
"the natural limit, the
ceiling to population,",00:03:21.219,00:03:25.651
"then no matter what this is doing,",00:03:25.805,00:03:27.546
"if this thing is approaching zero,",00:03:27.546,00:03:28.911
that's going to make the actual,00:03:28.911,00:03:30.765
rate of growth approach zero.,00:03:30.765,00:03:33.200
"So food is going to be more scarce,",00:03:33.002,00:03:35.363
it's going to be harder to find things.,00:03:35.561,00:03:37.234
"And so what can I construct here,",00:03:37.665,00:03:40.670
"dealing with N and K that
will have these properties?",00:03:40.067,00:03:41.776
"And for fun, you might actually want to",00:03:42.431,00:03:44.970
"pause the video and see
if you can construct",00:03:44.097,00:03:44.986
a fairly simple algebraic statement,00:03:45.859,00:03:48.194
using N and K and maybe the number one,00:03:48.194,00:03:50.706
"if you find the need,",00:03:50.706,00:03:52.215
"for an expression that
has these properties.",00:03:52.783,00:03:55.500
"Well, let's see.",00:03:56.869,00:03:57.715
What if we start with a one,00:03:57.715,00:03:58.786
and we subtract N over K?,00:04:01.329,00:04:05.434
Does this have those properties?,00:04:13.066,00:04:14.649
"Well yeah, sure it does.",00:04:15.945,00:04:16.961
"When N is really small, or I should say",00:04:16.961,00:04:19.387
"when it's a small fraction of K,",00:04:19.387,00:04:21.897
"this is going to be a small fraction,",00:04:23.543,00:04:24.644
then this whole thing is going to be,00:04:24.644,00:04:25.941
pretty close to one.,00:04:25.941,00:04:27.400
"It's going to be a
little bit less than one.",00:04:27.004,00:04:28.933
"And when N approaches K,",00:04:29.544,00:04:30.958
"as N gets closer and
closer and closer to K,",00:04:30.958,00:04:33.247
then this thing right over here,00:04:33.682,00:04:34.774
"is going to approach one,",00:04:35.602,00:04:37.274
which means this whole expression,00:04:37.274,00:04:38.587
is going to approach zero.,00:04:38.587,00:04:39.875
Which is exactly what we wanted.,00:04:39.875,00:04:42.720
"And this thing right
over here is actually,",00:04:42.072,00:04:44.178
"and this is used in tons of applications,",00:04:44.968,00:04:47.536
not just in population modeling,00:04:47.536,00:04:50.582
but that's kind of one of its first,00:04:50.582,00:04:53.641
reasons or motivations.,00:04:53.641,00:04:55.960
This differential equation right over here,00:04:56.186,00:04:57.261
is actually quite famous.,00:04:57.936,00:04:59.135
"It's called the logistic
differential equation.",00:04:59.359,00:05:02.450
"And in the next video,",00:05:13.346,00:05:14.169
we're actually going to solve this.,00:05:14.169,00:05:15.198
"And it's actually, this is a separable",00:05:15.639,00:05:17.360
differential equation.,00:05:17.036,00:05:17.978
You can actually solve it just using,00:05:18.302,00:05:19.365
standard techniques of integration.,00:05:19.932,00:05:21.540
"it's a little bit hairier than this one,",00:05:21.054,00:05:22.358
"so we're going to work
through it together.",00:05:22.844,00:05:24.498
And we're going to look at the solution.,00:05:24.498,00:05:25.823
"The solution to the logistic
differential equation",00:05:25.823,00:05:28.768
"is the logistic function, which once again",00:05:28.768,00:05:33.752
essentially models population in this way.,00:05:33.752,00:05:37.330
"But before we actually solve for it,",00:05:37.033,00:05:39.209
let's just try to interpret this,00:05:39.506,00:05:41.320
differential equation and think about,00:05:41.032,00:05:43.239
"what the shape of this
function might look like.",00:05:43.527,00:05:46.123
"And to do that,",00:05:46.589,00:05:47.602
let me draw some axes here.,00:05:52.723,00:05:56.811
Let me draw some axes here.,00:05:58.069,00:05:59.323
"So that's my time axis,",00:05:59.944,00:06:01.508
"that's my population axis,",00:06:01.508,00:06:03.201
"let me scroll up a little
bit because sometimes",00:06:03.801,00:06:05.340
the subtitles show up around here,00:06:05.034,00:06:06.131
and then people can't see what's going on.,00:06:07.031,00:06:08.552
"So let's think about a
couple of permutations,",00:06:09.454,00:06:11.126
a couple situations.,00:06:11.126,00:06:12.750
"So if our initial, if our
N at time equals zero,",00:06:12.075,00:06:16.583
remember N is a function of T.,00:06:18.097,00:06:18.738
"If at time equals zero N is equal to zero,",00:06:19.648,00:06:22.580
then this term is going to be zero,00:06:24.178,00:06:25.231
"and then your rate of
change is going to be zero,",00:06:25.708,00:06:27.917
"and so you're not going
to add any population.",00:06:27.917,00:06:29.988
And that's good.,00:06:30.244,00:06:31.128
"Because if your population is zero,",00:06:31.554,00:06:33.318
how are you going to actually be able,00:06:33.318,00:06:34.703
to add population?,00:06:34.703,00:06:35.666
There's no one there to have children.,00:06:35.666,00:06:37.755
So there's actually one constant solution,00:06:37.884,00:06:40.326
"to this differential equation,",00:06:40.326,00:06:42.487
which is just N of T is equal to zero.,00:06:44.648,00:06:46.810
"And this satisfies the
logistic differential equation.",00:06:46.081,00:06:49.057
"Hey, if your population starts at zero",00:06:49.008,00:06:50.903
"if N sub not is zero,",00:06:51.695,00:06:53.843
"then you're just going
to be at zero forever.",00:06:53.934,00:06:55.441
"Well that's actually what
would happen in real life",00:06:55.441,00:06:57.954
if there's no one there to have kids.,00:06:57.954,00:06:59.680
Now let's think about another situation.,00:07:00.018,00:07:01.097
"What if our population,",00:07:01.097,00:07:02.081
what if N not is equal to K?,00:07:02.954,00:07:04.939
"What happens if N not is equal to,",00:07:05.904,00:07:07.953
"so that's K right over there,",00:07:11.489,00:07:12.685
"what happens if at time equals zero,",00:07:12.685,00:07:14.788
this is our population.,00:07:15.182,00:07:16.706
"Well if N is equal to K,",00:07:16.706,00:07:18.640
"then this is one minus one,",00:07:18.064,00:07:19.077
"then this thing is zero,",00:07:19.653,00:07:20.665
and so our rate of population change,00:07:20.665,00:07:21.833
is going to be zero.,00:07:21.833,00:07:22.835
So essentially if my population is zero,00:07:23.223,00:07:24.904
"then after a little bit of time,",00:07:24.904,00:07:25.926
my population is still the same K.,00:07:25.926,00:07:27.342
"If my rate of change
of population is zero,",00:07:27.623,00:07:29.867
"that means my population
is staying constant.",00:07:29.867,00:07:31.950
And so my population's just going,00:07:32.352,00:07:34.390
to stay there at K.,00:07:34.039,00:07:35.498
And that's actually believable.,00:07:36.084,00:07:36.578
Malthus would actually probably say,00:07:37.334,00:07:38.687
"that you're gonna have, maybe it grows",00:07:38.687,00:07:40.311
"a little bit beyond the
capacity of the environment",00:07:40.311,00:07:43.674
"and then you have some flood,",00:07:43.674,00:07:46.577
or some hurricane or some famine,00:07:46.577,00:07:48.406
and it goes around.,00:07:48.406,00:07:49.408
"But for our purposes, you can never model",00:07:49.534,00:07:51.716
anything perfectly.,00:07:51.716,00:07:52.758
"For our purposes, that's pretty good.",00:07:52.948,00:07:55.116
You're at the limit of what the,00:07:55.116,00:07:57.110
"environment can handle,",00:07:57.011,00:07:59.016
so you just kind of stay there.,00:07:59.115,00:08:01.650
That's actually another constant solution.,00:08:01.065,00:08:02.320
"that N of T, if it starts,",00:08:02.905,00:08:05.147
and now you can kind of appreciate,00:08:05.147,00:08:06.769
why initial conditions are important.,00:08:06.769,00:08:08.378
"If you start at zero you're
going to stay at zero,",00:08:08.378,00:08:09.530
"if you start at K you're
going to stay at K.",00:08:09.053,00:08:10.107
So that is N of T just stays K.,00:08:11.345,00:08:13.947
"But now let's think of a
more interesting scenario.",00:08:14.694,00:08:16.780
Let's assume an initial population,00:08:17.253,00:08:20.089
that's someplace between zero and K.,00:08:20.089,00:08:22.492
So this is going to be...,00:08:22.492,00:08:24.095
I'm going to assume initial population,00:08:25.484,00:08:26.575
"that is someplace, it's greater than zero,",00:08:27.052,00:08:30.958
"so there are people to
actually have children,",00:08:31.605,00:08:34.030
"and it is less than K,",00:08:34.025,00:08:35.583
"so we aren't fully maxing
out the environment.",00:08:35.808,00:08:38.823
Or the land or the food or the water,00:08:38.929,00:08:40.885
or whatever it might be.,00:08:40.885,00:08:41.874
So what's going to happen?,00:08:41.874,00:08:43.138
"So, and once again, I'm just going to",00:08:43.462,00:08:44.535
"kind of sketch it,",00:08:44.535,00:08:45.636
"and then we're going to
solve it in the next video.",00:08:45.636,00:08:47.595
"So when N is a lot less than K,",00:08:48.215,00:08:50.071
"it's a small fraction of K,",00:08:50.071,00:08:51.128
this term is going to be the main one,00:08:53.548,00:08:54.589
that's influencing it.,00:08:54.958,00:08:56.427
"Because this is a small fraction of K,",00:08:56.427,00:08:58.425
"I mean even the way I drew it,",00:08:58.425,00:08:59.363
"it looks like it's about
a sixth or a seventh",00:08:59.363,00:09:02.441
"or an eighth of K,",00:09:03.143,00:09:04.186
so it's one minus 1/8.,00:09:04.501,00:09:06.279
So it's gonna be 7/8 times this.,00:09:06.279,00:09:11.163
"So really, this is what's going to dictate",00:09:11.335,00:09:14.883
what our rate of growth is.,00:09:16.067,00:09:17.125
"And if this is kind of dictating it,",00:09:17.417,00:09:18.852
we're kind of looking more of a...,00:09:18.852,00:09:20.929
"well, let's just think of it this way.",00:09:21.145,00:09:22.532
"As the population grows,",00:09:22.582,00:09:23.691
the rate of change is going to grow.,00:09:23.691,00:09:27.172
So it's going to look something like this.,00:09:27.484,00:09:32.484
"As our population gets larger,",00:09:33.004,00:09:34.076
our slope is getting higher.,00:09:35.012,00:09:37.101
It's getting steeper and steeper.,00:09:37.209,00:09:38.724
"But then as N approaches K,",00:09:39.153,00:09:41.041
"then this thing is gonna become,",00:09:41.246,00:09:42.951
this is gonna be close to one minus...,00:09:42.989,00:09:44.698
close to one.,00:09:44.698,00:09:46.099
"And so this is going to
become a very small number,",00:09:46.099,00:09:48.118
"it's going to make this
whole thing approach zero.",00:09:48.118,00:09:50.204
"So as N approaches K,",00:09:50.646,00:09:52.162
"the whole thing, the rate of change",00:09:52.771,00:09:54.548
is going to flatten out.,00:09:54.548,00:09:57.029
And we're gonna asymptote towards K.,00:09:57.459,00:09:59.440
And so the solution to the,00:09:59.858,00:10:03.441
logistic differential equation,00:10:03.441,00:10:05.493
should look something like this.,00:10:05.961,00:10:07.874
"Depending on what your
initial conditions are.",00:10:07.874,00:10:09.679
"If your initial condition is here,",00:10:09.679,00:10:10.756
maybe it does something like this.,00:10:10.756,00:10:12.091
"If your initial condition's here,",00:10:12.091,00:10:13.415
maybe it does something like this.,00:10:13.415,00:10:16.393
"And once again, this is what's fun",00:10:16.393,00:10:17.559
about doing differential equations.,00:10:17.559,00:10:18.361
"Before even doing the fancy math,",00:10:18.361,00:10:19.964
"you can kind of get an intuition,",00:10:19.964,00:10:21.221
"just by thinking through
the differential equation",00:10:21.221,00:10:22.987
of what it is likely to be.,00:10:22.987,00:10:26.325
"Down here, or when N
is much smaller than K",00:10:26.438,00:10:30.449
its rate of increase is increasing,00:10:30.072,00:10:32.056
"as N increases,",00:10:32.704,00:10:34.106
"and over here as N gets close to K,",00:10:34.148,00:10:35.224
its rate of increase is decreasing.,00:10:35.908,00:10:38.996
"Now let's actually in the next video,",00:10:39.351,00:10:40.458
"actually solve for what
N, a solution to this",00:10:40.458,00:10:43.526
"and see if that confirms
what our intuition is.",00:10:44.138,00:10:47.129
