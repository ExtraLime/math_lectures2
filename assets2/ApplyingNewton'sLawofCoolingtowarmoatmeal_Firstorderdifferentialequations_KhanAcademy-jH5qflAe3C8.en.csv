- [Voiceover] Let's now actually apply,00:00:00.471,00:00:01.560
Newton's Law of Cooling.,00:00:01.056,00:00:02.377
"Just to remind ourselves, if
capitol T is the temperature",00:00:02.881,00:00:05.939
"of something in celsius degrees,",00:00:06.461,00:00:08.009
"and lower case t is time in minutes,",00:00:08.009,00:00:10.070
"we can say that the rate of change,",00:00:10.007,00:00:13.951
the rate of change of our temperature,00:00:14.014,00:00:16.017
"with respect to time,",00:00:16.017,00:00:17.840
is going to be proportional,00:00:17.084,00:00:18.146
and I'll write a negative K over here.,00:00:19.046,00:00:20.807
"We assumed our concept K is positive,",00:00:21.221,00:00:22.932
"then a negative K is going to
proportional to the difference",00:00:22.932,00:00:27.932
between the temperature of our thing,00:00:28.554,00:00:32.397
and the ambient temperature in the room.,00:00:32.397,00:00:35.846
"Once again, why do I
have a negative there?",00:00:35.846,00:00:37.353
"Well, because if the
temperature of our thing",00:00:37.353,00:00:38.904
"is larger than the
temperature of our room,",00:00:38.904,00:00:41.015
"we would expect that we would
be decreasing in temperature.",00:00:41.015,00:00:44.263
We would have a negative rate of chance.,00:00:44.263,00:00:46.417
"Temperature should be
decreasing over time.",00:00:46.417,00:00:48.453
"If, on the other hand,
our temperature is lower",00:00:48.453,00:00:51.509
than the ambient temperature of the room,00:00:51.509,00:00:53.511
then this thing is going to be negative,00:00:53.529,00:00:55.071
"and we would want a
positive rate of change.",00:00:55.071,00:00:57.966
Things would be warming up.,00:00:57.966,00:00:59.264
That's why a negative of a negative,00:00:59.264,00:01:01.086
would give you the positive.,00:01:01.086,00:01:02.927
"This right over here, this
differential equation,",00:01:02.927,00:01:03.992
we already saw it in a previous video,00:01:04.577,00:01:06.043
on Newton's Law of Cooling.,00:01:06.043,00:01:08.121
We even saw a general solution to that.,00:01:08.121,00:01:10.916
"The general solution that I care about,",00:01:10.916,00:01:13.022
"because we are now going
to deal with the scenario",00:01:13.022,00:01:14.756
"where we are putting
something warm in a...",00:01:14.756,00:01:17.443
"Or we are going to put
a warm bowl of oatmeal",00:01:17.443,00:01:19.929
in a room temperature room.,00:01:19.929,00:01:22.983
"Given that, we are
going to assume the case",00:01:23.662,00:01:25.234
that we saw in the last video,00:01:25.234,00:01:26.573
"where our temperature is
greater than or equal to",00:01:26.573,00:01:30.575
the ambient temperature.,00:01:30.593,00:01:31.666
"In that situation, our general
solution boiled down to...",00:01:32.323,00:01:37.323
"It boiled down to temperature
as a function of time",00:01:37.888,00:01:42.814
"is equal to some constant
times e to the negative KT,",00:01:42.814,00:01:47.814
"negative KT, plus our ambient temperature.",00:01:51.222,00:01:55.580
Plus our ambient temperature.,00:01:55.058,00:01:57.231
"Once again, we figured
this out in our last video.",00:01:57.753,00:02:00.318
"Now, let's actually apply it.",00:02:00.318,00:02:01.740
I said we were dealing with the scenario,00:02:01.074,00:02:02.880
where our temperature is greater than,00:02:03.546,00:02:04.977
or equal to the ambient temperature.,00:02:04.977,00:02:06.418
Let's assume we are in a scenario...,00:02:06.418,00:02:08.884
Let's assume a scenario where,00:02:08.884,00:02:10.600
"our ambient temperature
is 20 degrees celsius.",00:02:10.006,00:02:13.122
We assume that doesn't change.,00:02:13.716,00:02:14.730
The room is just large enough that even if,00:02:14.856,00:02:16.879
something that is warmer is put into it,00:02:16.879,00:02:19.453
the ambient temperature does not change.,00:02:19.453,00:02:22.264
"Let's say that the thing
that we have put in it,",00:02:22.782,00:02:25.057
"our warm bowl of oatmeal,",00:02:25.057,00:02:27.964
"let's say it starts off the
moment we put it in the room,",00:02:27.964,00:02:29.997
"that time equals zero,",00:02:29.997,00:02:31.865
is 80 degrees celsius.,00:02:31.865,00:02:35.989
"Let's say we also know,
just from previous tests,",00:02:35.996,00:02:37.996
"that after two minutes, after two minutes,",00:02:37.996,00:02:41.107
it gets to 60 degrees celsius.,00:02:41.107,00:02:43.529
"We also know that T of
two is 60 degrees celsius.",00:02:43.669,00:02:48.669
"Given all of this
information right over here,",00:02:50.953,00:02:53.014
"using Newton's Law of Cooling,",00:02:53.014,00:02:54.770
and using all of this information we know,00:02:54.077,00:02:55.883
"about how bowls of oatmeal
that start at this temperature",00:02:56.576,00:02:59.838
"have cooled in the past,",00:02:59.838,00:03:01.421
we want to know how long it will take.,00:03:01.421,00:03:03.918
How many minutes will have to pass,00:03:03.918,00:03:05.616
"when you put an 80 degree
bowl of oatmeal in the room?",00:03:05.616,00:03:07.929
How many minutes have to pass,00:03:07.929,00:03:09.216
in order for it to get to 40 degrees,00:03:09.216,00:03:11.327
using this model?,00:03:11.327,00:03:13.551
Let me write that down.,00:03:13.551,00:03:15.247
So how long...,00:03:15.247,00:03:16.688
How many minutes for...,00:03:16.688,00:03:21.074
"or let me just say to cool
to 40 degrees celsius?",00:03:23.978,00:03:28.978
I encourage you to pause the video now,00:03:34.269,00:03:36.132
and try to figure it out.,00:03:36.132,00:03:38.750
"I'm assuming you have paused the video,",00:03:39.191,00:03:41.228
and you have had your go at it,00:03:41.228,00:03:43.339
"and the key is to use
all of this information",00:03:43.339,00:03:45.300
"right over here to solve
for the constants C and K,",00:03:45.003,00:03:48.001
"and once you know that, you essentially",00:03:48.298,00:03:50.196
have described your model.,00:03:50.196,00:03:52.659
"Then you can apply it
to solve for the time",00:03:52.659,00:03:56.467
"that gets you to a temperature
of 40 degrees celsius.",00:03:56.467,00:03:59.468
So let's do that.,00:03:59.567,00:04:00.615
The first thing we know is,00:04:00.615,00:04:00.714
"the ambient temperature
is 20 degrees celsius.",00:04:01.605,00:04:03.732
This right over here,00:04:03.732,00:04:05.977
is 20 degrees.,00:04:06.502,00:04:09.903
"The most obvious thing
to solve for or to apply",00:04:09.903,00:04:13.011
is what happens with T of zero.,00:04:13.011,00:04:14.883
"What's neat about T of zero,",00:04:14.883,00:04:16.451
"when T equals zero, this exponent is zero,",00:04:16.451,00:04:18.923
"either the zero power is one,",00:04:18.923,00:04:20.959
"and so T of zero is
essentially going to simplify",00:04:20.959,00:04:23.023
to Ce plus 20 degrees.,00:04:23.599,00:04:25.224
Let me actually right that down.,00:04:25.224,00:04:26.729
"T of zero, which we
already know is 80 degrees,",00:04:26.729,00:04:31.729
we already know as 80 degrees celsius.,00:04:32.181,00:04:33.765
I'm just going to write 80.,00:04:33.765,00:04:35.236
We will assume it's in degrees celsius.,00:04:35.236,00:04:38.287
That is going to be equal to...,00:04:38.287,00:04:40.351
That is going to be equal to,00:04:40.927,00:04:41.930
"when T equals zero, this,",00:04:41.957,00:04:43.244
the e to the zero is just going to be one.,00:04:43.244,00:04:46.003
"It's going to be equal
to C plus, C plus 20.",00:04:46.003,00:04:51.003
"If you want to solve for
C, you just subtract 20",00:04:52.804,00:04:55.571
from both sides of this equation.,00:04:55.571,00:04:59.294
We are left with...,00:04:59.618,00:05:01.943
"We are left with 80 minus
20 is 60, is equal to C.",00:05:01.943,00:05:06.943
60 is equal to C.,00:05:07.529,00:05:10.146
We were able to figure out C.,00:05:10.178,00:05:11.307
Let's figure out what we know right now.,00:05:11.307,00:05:14.148
"We know that T, let me
do that in magenta color.",00:05:14.148,00:05:18.161
"We know that T of t, that's confusing,",00:05:18.278,00:05:21.399
"upper case T of lower case t,",00:05:21.399,00:05:25.014
"temperature as a function of time,",00:05:25.014,00:05:26.615
is going to be equal to...,00:05:26.615,00:05:29.412
"is going to be equal
to in that same color,",00:05:29.412,00:05:31.994
"60 e to the negative
KT, negative KT plus 20,",00:05:31.994,00:05:36.994
plus our ambient temperature.,00:05:42.877,00:05:44.972
Plus our ambient temperature.,00:05:44.972,00:05:46.004
"Now, we need to solve for K.",00:05:46.292,00:05:48.445
"We can use this information
right over here to solve for K.",00:05:48.445,00:05:51.087
T of two is equal to 60 degrees.,00:05:51.087,00:05:55.339
"If we make t as equal to two,",00:05:55.466,00:05:56.539
this thing is going to be 60 degrees.,00:05:56.539,00:05:58.513
Let me write that down.,00:05:58.513,00:06:00.435
"Let me write that over
here so we have some space.",00:06:00.435,00:06:03.089
We have 60 is equal to...,00:06:03.089,00:06:05.968
"60 is equal to 60, is equal to 60",00:06:05.968,00:06:10.607
"e to the negative K T,",00:06:10.607,00:06:14.136
"all this color switching takes time,",00:06:14.206,00:06:15.915
"e to the negative K T, plus",00:06:15.915,00:06:20.718
"oh, and be careful, that's a times two.",00:06:20.718,00:06:22.685
E to the negative K times two.,00:06:22.685,00:06:25.626
"That's a time equals two,",00:06:25.626,00:06:27.370
"I could write that E
to the negative two K.",00:06:27.037,00:06:29.730
"E to the negative two K,",00:06:30.063,00:06:32.285
and then of course we have our plus 20.,00:06:32.285,00:06:35.209
Then we have our plus 20.,00:06:35.429,00:06:37.805
Now we just have to solve for K.,00:06:37.805,00:06:39.543
"Once again, at any point, if
you feel inspired to do so",00:06:39.543,00:06:42.534
"I encourage you to try
to solve it on your own.",00:06:42.534,00:06:46.570
"Alright, so let's do this.",00:06:46.057,00:06:47.028
"If we subtract 20 from both sides,",00:06:47.541,00:06:50.790
"we get 40 is equal to 60
e to the negative two K.",00:06:50.079,00:06:55.079
Divide both sides by 60.,00:07:03.078,00:07:06.132
You are left with two thirds.,00:07:06.212,00:07:11.212
40 divided by 60 is two thirds.,00:07:11.281,00:07:12.904
is equal to e to the negative two K.,00:07:12.904,00:07:17.008
E to the negative two K.,00:07:17.493,00:07:21.427
All this color changing takes work.,00:07:21.427,00:07:22.465
"Let me know if y'all
want me to keep changing.",00:07:22.465,00:07:23.860
I enjoy changing colors.,00:07:23.086,00:07:24.333
"It just keeps it
interesting on the screen.",00:07:25.107,00:07:26.998
"Anyway, e to the negative two K.",00:07:26.998,00:07:29.400
"Actually, let me scroll down a little bit",00:07:29.004,00:07:30.248
"so I have some more real
estate to work with.",00:07:30.644,00:07:33.325
"Now I can take, let's see.",00:07:33.325,00:07:35.260
I can take the natural log of both sides.,00:07:35.026,00:07:37.248
"So, I'll have the natural log.",00:07:37.482,00:07:41.130
Natural log of two thirds is equal to,00:07:41.213,00:07:45.090
"the natural log of e
to the negative two K.",00:07:45.009,00:07:48.187
That's the whole reason why,00:07:48.268,00:07:48.847
I took the natural log of both sides.,00:07:48.847,00:07:50.678
"Then to solve for K, I divide
both sides by negative two.",00:07:50.678,00:07:54.052
I get K is equal to negative one half.,00:07:54.052,00:07:58.793
"Negative one half the
natural log of two thirds.",00:07:58.793,00:08:03.355
I just swapped sides.,00:08:03.355,00:08:04.918
Natural log of two thirds.,00:08:04.918,00:08:06.625
"Let me do that since I kept
the colors going so long,",00:08:06.625,00:08:08.694
let me keep it that way.,00:08:08.694,00:08:10.515
Natural log of two thirds.,00:08:10.515,00:08:12.554
"So we have solved for
all of the constants.",00:08:12.554,00:08:16.539
"Now we can rewrite this
thing right over here.",00:08:16.539,00:08:19.206
We can rewrite it as...,00:08:19.206,00:08:20.995
"We just need a mini drumroll here,",00:08:20.995,00:08:22.596
we are not completely done yet.,00:08:22.596,00:08:24.360
We get t of T is equal to 60 e...,00:08:24.036,00:08:29.036
e to the negative K.,00:08:33.405,00:08:35.945
"Well, negative K, the
negative and negative",00:08:35.945,00:08:37.004
is going to be positive.,00:08:37.534,00:08:38.481
"It will be one half
natural log of two thirds.",00:08:38.481,00:08:41.148
So one half natural log of two thirds.,00:08:41.148,00:08:45.023
"Negative K, so negative of a negative.",00:08:45.023,00:08:47.080
"One half natural log of two thirds,",00:08:47.008,00:08:49.926
which actually will be a negative value.,00:08:49.998,00:08:51.541
"Two thirds is less than e,
so you are going to have",00:08:51.541,00:08:53.545
"a natural log of it is
going to be negative",00:08:53.941,00:08:55.900
"so it makes you feel
good that the temperature",00:08:55.009,00:08:56.826
is going to be going down over time.,00:08:57.717,00:09:00.263
"So, plus or times T, plus 20.",00:09:00.263,00:09:05.263
"Now, all we have to do is
figure out what T get us",00:09:07.701,00:09:10.836
to a temperature of 40 degrees celsius.,00:09:10.836,00:09:13.381
Let's solve for that.,00:09:13.381,00:09:14.780
"If we want this to be
40, 40 is equal to...",00:09:14.078,00:09:17.815
"Actually now I'm just
going to stick to one color",00:09:18.517,00:09:20.555
as we march through this part.,00:09:20.555,00:09:23.208
"40 is going to be equal to 60
e to the one half natural log",00:09:23.208,00:09:28.208
of two thirds T power plus 20.,00:09:29.813,00:09:34.355
"Now, let's see.",00:09:34.355,00:09:35.451
We can subtract 20 from both sides.,00:09:35.451,00:09:37.556
"We get to 20 is equal to 60
e to all that crazy business,",00:09:37.556,00:09:42.540
"one half natural log
of two thirds times T.",00:09:42.054,00:09:46.473
"Now we can divide both sides
by 60 and we get one third.",00:09:46.959,00:09:50.647
"20 divided by 60 is one third,",00:09:50.647,00:09:52.359
is equal to e to the one half natural log,00:09:52.359,00:09:57.359
of two thirds times T.,00:09:58.077,00:10:02.140
"Now, let's see, we can take
the natural log of both sides.",00:10:02.014,00:10:05.218
The natural log of one third is equal to,00:10:05.344,00:10:10.344
one half natural log of two thirds times T,00:10:11.951,00:10:16.951
and then home stretch to solve for T,00:10:17.863,00:10:19.252
you just divide both sides by one half,00:10:19.252,00:10:20.786
natural log of two thirds.,00:10:20.786,00:10:22.489
"We get T is equal to this, which is",00:10:22.489,00:10:25.447
the natural log of one third divided by,00:10:25.447,00:10:30.447
one half natural log of two thirds.,00:10:30.054,00:10:31.706
"Well, if you divide by one
half that's the same thing",00:10:32.192,00:10:33.698
as multiplying by two.,00:10:33.698,00:10:35.344
"Then you are going to divide
by natural log of two thirds.",00:10:35.344,00:10:40.344
"Let's see if this actually
makes a sensical answer.",00:10:42.091,00:10:46.067
Let me get a calculator out.,00:10:46.067,00:10:47.600
"Actually, I could just use Google here.",00:10:47.006,00:10:52.006
I had ... I already forgot what it was.,00:10:52.885,00:10:56.573
Natural log one--,00:10:56.573,00:10:58.260
So I had natural log one third,00:10:58.026,00:10:59.142
over natural log of two thirds,00:10:59.376,00:11:00.390
and the whole thing times two.,00:11:00.039,00:11:01.403
"So I can type two times the
natural log of one third",00:11:01.754,00:11:06.754
divided by the natural log of two thirds.,00:11:17.904,00:11:22.904
Let's see what Google gets us.,00:11:24.473,00:11:28.086
"Alright, it didn't ...",00:11:28.663,00:11:30.801
How did I mess up?,00:11:30.801,00:11:32.606
"This is equal to two
times the natural log--",00:11:32.606,00:11:33.684
"Oh, okay, it messed up the parenthesis.",00:11:34.386,00:11:36.789
Let me make this clear.,00:11:36.789,00:11:37.798
The natural log of one third,00:11:37.879,00:11:41.697
divided by the natural log of two thirds.,00:11:41.697,00:11:45.385
"Then, there you go.",00:11:47.308,00:11:48.740
"If we were to round to
the nearest hundredth",00:11:48.074,00:11:49.733
it would be five point four two.,00:11:50.399,00:11:53.263
Five point four two minutes.,00:11:53.263,00:11:56.438
"Remember, everything we
were doing were in minutes.",00:11:56.438,00:11:58.537
"This right over here, this
is approximately equal to",00:11:58.537,00:12:02.760
five point four two.,00:12:02.076,00:12:06.107
Five point four two minutes.,00:12:07.007,00:12:09.964
And we are done!,00:12:10.027,00:12:11.220
"That's how long it will take
us to cool to 40 degrees.",00:12:11.022,00:12:16.022
