"We've already seen
that you can visually",00:00:00.474,00:00:02.140
"represent a vector as an arrow,
where the length of the arrow",00:00:02.140,00:00:06.420
"is the magnitude of the vector
and the direction of the arrow",00:00:06.420,00:00:10.700
is the direction of the vector.,00:00:10.700,00:00:12.650
"And if we want to represent
this mathematically,",00:00:12.650,00:00:15.650
"we could just think
about, well, starting",00:00:15.650,00:00:19.180
"from the tail of
the vector, how far",00:00:19.180,00:00:22.720
"away is the head of the vector
in the horizontal direction?",00:00:22.720,00:00:27.120
"And how far away is it in
the vertical direction?",00:00:27.120,00:00:29.300
"So for example, in the
horizontal direction,",00:00:29.300,00:00:32.720
"you would have to
go this distance.",00:00:32.720,00:00:37.020
"And then in the
vertical direction,",00:00:37.020,00:00:38.730
"you would have to
go this distance.",00:00:38.730,00:00:42.265
"Let me do that in
a different color.",00:00:42.265,00:00:44.260
"You would have to go this
distance right over here.",00:00:44.260,00:00:49.140
"And so let's just say
that this distance is 2",00:00:49.140,00:00:52.700
and that this distance is 3.,00:00:52.700,00:00:55.040
"We could represent
this vector-- and let's",00:00:55.040,00:00:56.870
"call this vector v. We
could represent vector",00:00:56.870,00:01:00.070
"v as an ordered list or a
2-tuple of-- so we could say we",00:01:00.070,00:01:08.250
"move 2 in the
horizontal direction",00:01:08.250,00:01:11.040
and 3 in the vertical direction.,00:01:11.040,00:01:14.980
"So you could represent
it like that.",00:01:14.980,00:01:16.880
"You could represent
vector v like this,",00:01:16.880,00:01:19.390
"where it is 2
comma 3, like that.",00:01:19.390,00:01:25.742
"And what I now want
to introduce you to--",00:01:25.742,00:01:27.450
"and we could come up with
other ways of representing",00:01:27.450,00:01:29.616
"this 2-tuple-- is
another notation.",00:01:29.616,00:01:32.360
"And this really
comes out of the idea",00:01:32.360,00:01:34.180
"of what it means to
add and scale vectors.",00:01:34.180,00:01:37.550
"And to do that,
we're going to define",00:01:37.550,00:01:39.150
what we call unit vectors.,00:01:39.150,00:01:40.825
"And if we're in
two dimensions, we",00:01:45.630,00:01:47.230
"define a unit vector for
each of the dimensions",00:01:47.230,00:01:49.950
we're operating in.,00:01:49.950,00:01:50.912
"If we're in three dimensions,
we would define a unit vector",00:01:50.912,00:01:53.370
"for each of the three dimensions
that we're operating in.",00:01:53.370,00:01:56.210
And so let's do that.,00:01:56.210,00:01:57.640
So let's define a unit vector i.,00:01:57.640,00:02:00.040
"And the way that we denote
that is the unit vector",00:02:00.040,00:02:04.826
"is, instead of putting
an arrow on top,",00:02:04.826,00:02:06.450
we put this hat on top of it.,00:02:06.450,00:02:09.320
"So the unit vector
i, if we wanted",00:02:09.320,00:02:11.620
"to write it in this
notation right over here,",00:02:11.620,00:02:14.060
"we would say it only goes 1 unit
in the horizontal direction,",00:02:14.060,00:02:18.220
"and it doesn't go at all
in the vertical direction.",00:02:18.220,00:02:21.080
"So it would look
something like this.",00:02:21.080,00:02:22.665
That is the unit vector i.,00:02:26.842,00:02:29.810
"And then we can define
another unit vector.",00:02:29.810,00:02:31.920
"And let's call
that unit vector--",00:02:31.920,00:02:33.740
"or it's typically
called j, which",00:02:33.740,00:02:37.620
"would go only in the
vertical direction and not",00:02:37.620,00:02:40.259
in the horizontal direction.,00:02:40.259,00:02:41.425
"And not in the
horizontal direction,",00:02:41.425,00:02:43.290
"and it goes 1 unit in
the vertical direction.",00:02:43.290,00:02:45.680
"So this went 1 unit
in the horizontal.",00:02:45.680,00:02:48.210
"And now j is going to go
1 unit in the vertical.",00:02:48.210,00:02:54.410
So j-- just like that.,00:02:54.410,00:02:57.260
"Now any vector, any
two dimensional vector,",00:02:57.260,00:03:00.880
"we can now represent as a sum of
scaled up versions of i and j.",00:03:00.880,00:03:07.560
"And you say, well,
how do we do that?",00:03:07.560,00:03:09.300
"Well, you could imagine
vector v right here",00:03:09.300,00:03:13.470
"is the sum of a vector
that moves purely",00:03:13.470,00:03:15.820
"in the horizontal direction
that has a length 2,",00:03:15.820,00:03:18.930
"and a vector that moves purely
in the vertical direction that",00:03:18.930,00:03:21.740
has length 3.,00:03:21.740,00:03:23.320
"So we could say
that vector v-- let",00:03:23.320,00:03:28.530
"me do it in that
same blue color--",00:03:28.530,00:03:33.230
"is equal to-- so if we want
a vector that has length 2",00:03:33.230,00:03:36.690
"and it moves purely in
the horizontal direction,",00:03:36.690,00:03:39.160
"well, we could just scale
up the unit vector i.",00:03:39.160,00:03:42.150
"We could just
multiply 2 times i.",00:03:42.150,00:03:44.245
"So let's do that-- is equal
to 2 times our unit vector i.",00:03:44.245,00:03:49.385
"So 2i is going to
be this whole thing",00:03:49.385,00:03:52.580
"right over here or
this whole vector.",00:03:52.580,00:03:55.250
"Let me do it in
this yellow color.",00:03:55.250,00:03:56.800
"This vector right over
here, you could view as 2i.",00:03:56.800,00:04:00.510
"And then to that, we're going to
add 3 times j-- so plus 3 times",00:04:00.510,00:04:08.420
j.,00:04:08.420,00:04:08.920
Let me write it like this.,00:04:11.510,00:04:12.740
Let me get that color.,00:04:12.740,00:04:15.890
"Once again, 3 times
j is going to be",00:04:15.890,00:04:18.200
this vector right over here.,00:04:18.200,00:04:20.760
"And if you add this yellow
vector right over here",00:04:20.760,00:04:25.700
"to the magenta vector,
you're going to get-- notice,",00:04:25.700,00:04:29.150
"we're putting the tail
of the magenta vector",00:04:29.150,00:04:31.110
"at the head of
the yellow vector.",00:04:31.110,00:04:32.760
"And if you start at the
tail of the yellow vector",00:04:32.760,00:04:34.410
"and you go all the way to the
head of the magenta vector,",00:04:34.410,00:04:36.830
"you have now constructed
vector v. So vector v,",00:04:36.830,00:04:42.340
"you could represent it as a
column vector like this, 2 3.",00:04:42.340,00:04:46.220
"You could represent
it as 2 comma 3,",00:04:46.220,00:04:48.060
"or you could represent it as
2 times i with this little hat",00:04:48.060,00:04:51.440
"over it, plus 3 times j,
with this little hat over it.",00:04:51.440,00:04:55.080
"i is the unit vector in
the horizontal direction,",00:04:55.080,00:04:57.980
"in the positive
horizontal direction.",00:04:57.980,00:04:59.570
"If you want to go
the other way, you",00:04:59.570,00:05:00.455
would multiply it by a negative.,00:05:00.455,00:05:02.190
"And j is the unit vector
in the vertical direction.",00:05:02.190,00:05:05.716
"As we'll see in future
videos, once you",00:05:05.716,00:05:07.340
"go to three dimensions,
you'll introduce a k.",00:05:07.340,00:05:11.320
"But it's very natural to
translate between these two",00:05:11.320,00:05:13.491
things.,00:05:13.491,00:05:13.990
"Notice, 2, 3-- 2, 3.",00:05:13.990,00:05:16.840
"And so with that, let's actually
do some vector operations",00:05:16.840,00:05:19.550
using this notation.,00:05:19.550,00:05:21.470
"So let's say that I
define another vector.",00:05:21.470,00:05:24.090
Let's say it is vector b.,00:05:24.090,00:05:27.195
"I'll just come up with
some numbers here.",00:05:31.090,00:05:33.400
"Vector b is equal to negative 1
times i-- times the unit vector",00:05:33.400,00:05:39.130
"i-- plus 4 times the unit vector
in the horizontal direction.",00:05:39.130,00:05:48.000
"So given these two
vector definitions,",00:05:48.000,00:05:50.320
"what would the would be the
vector v plus b be equal to?",00:05:50.320,00:05:57.500
"And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it.",00:05:57.500,00:06:00.410
"Well once again,
we just literally",00:06:00.410,00:06:02.000
"have to add
corresponding components.",00:06:02.000,00:06:04.404
"We could say, OK,
well let's think",00:06:04.404,00:06:05.820
"about what we're doing in
the horizontal direction.",00:06:05.820,00:06:07.760
"We're going 2 in the
horizontal direction here,",00:06:07.760,00:06:09.830
and now we're going negative 1.,00:06:09.830,00:06:11.540
"So our horizontal
component is going",00:06:11.540,00:06:13.410
"to be 2 plus negative
1-- 2 plus negative 1",00:06:13.410,00:06:20.470
in the horizontal direction.,00:06:20.470,00:06:22.200
"And we're going to multiply
that times the unit vector i.",00:06:22.200,00:06:24.690
"And this, once
again, just goes back",00:06:24.690,00:06:26.710
"to adding the corresponding
components of the vector.",00:06:26.710,00:06:30.110
"And then we're going to have
plus 4, or plus 3 plus 4-- And",00:06:30.110,00:06:36.715
"let me write it that way--
times the unit vector",00:06:36.715,00:06:47.410
j in the vertical direction.,00:06:47.410,00:06:50.430
"And so that's going
to give us-- I'll",00:06:50.430,00:06:54.140
"do this all in this one color--
2 plus negative 1 is 1i.",00:06:54.140,00:06:59.270
"And we could literally
write that just as i.",00:06:59.270,00:07:01.120
"Actually, let's do that.",00:07:01.120,00:07:02.120
Let's just write that as i.,00:07:02.120,00:07:03.810
"But we got that from 2
plus negative 1 is 1.",00:07:03.810,00:07:05.940
"1 times the vector is just
going to be that vector,",00:07:05.940,00:07:08.260
plus 3 plus 4 is 7-- 7j.,00:07:08.260,00:07:15.380
"And you see, this is exactly
how we saw vector addition",00:07:15.380,00:07:19.130
"in the past, is that we
could also represent vector",00:07:19.130,00:07:22.160
b like this.,00:07:22.160,00:07:23.430
"We could represent it
like this-- negative 1, 4.",00:07:23.430,00:07:28.805
"And so if you were
to add v to b,",00:07:31.450,00:07:33.050
you add the corresponding terms.,00:07:33.050,00:07:35.520
"So if we were to add
corresponding terms, looking",00:07:35.520,00:07:39.270
"at them as column
vectors, that is",00:07:39.270,00:07:41.440
"going to be equal to 2 plus
negative 1, which is 1.",00:07:41.440,00:07:46.340
3 plus 4 is 7.,00:07:46.340,00:07:49.070
"So this is the exact same
representation as this.",00:07:49.070,00:07:52.982
"This is using unit
vector notation,",00:07:52.982,00:07:54.440
"and this is representing
it as a column vector.",00:07:54.440,00:07:58.190
