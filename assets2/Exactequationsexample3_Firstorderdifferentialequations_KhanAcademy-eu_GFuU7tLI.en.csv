Welcome back.,00:00:00.570,00:00:01.290
"I'm just trying to show you as
many examples as possible of",00:00:01.290,00:00:04.580
"solving exact differential
equations.",00:00:04.580,00:00:07.560
"One, trying to figure
out whether the",00:00:07.560,00:00:09.210
equations are exact.,00:00:09.210,00:00:10.350
"And then if you know they're
exact, how do you figure out",00:00:10.350,00:00:12.650
"the psi and figure out
the solution of the",00:00:12.650,00:00:14.470
differential equation?,00:00:14.470,00:00:15.650
"So the next one in my book is
3x squared minus 2xy plus 2",00:00:15.650,00:00:27.820
"times dx, plus 6y squared minus
x squared plus 3 times",00:00:27.820,00:00:40.400
dy is equal to 0.,00:00:40.400,00:00:43.060
"So just the way it was
written, this isn't",00:00:43.060,00:00:45.040
"superficially in that form
that we want, right?",00:00:45.040,00:00:47.330
What's the form that we want?,00:00:47.330,00:00:48.370
"We want some function of x and
y plus another function of x",00:00:48.370,00:00:54.120
"and y, times y prime, or
dy dx, is equal to 0.",00:00:54.120,00:01:00.530
We're close.,00:01:00.530,00:01:01.570
"How could we get this equation
into this form?",00:01:01.570,00:01:04.410
"We just divide both sides of
this equation by dx, right?",00:01:04.410,00:01:07.580
"And then we get 3x squared
minus 2xy plus 2.",00:01:07.580,00:01:14.110
"We're dividing by dx, so that
dx just becomes a 1.",00:01:14.110,00:01:17.530
"Plus 6y squared minus
x squared plus 3.",00:01:17.530,00:01:23.830
"And then we're dividing by dx,
so that becomes dy dx, is",00:01:23.830,00:01:28.360
"equal to-- what's
0 divided by dx?",00:01:28.360,00:01:30.190
Well it's just 0.,00:01:30.190,00:01:31.430
And there we have it.,00:01:31.430,00:01:32.200
"We have written this
in the form that we",00:01:32.200,00:01:33.800
"need, in this form.",00:01:33.800,00:01:35.580
"And now we need to prove to
ourselves that this is an",00:01:35.580,00:01:38.260
exact equation.,00:01:38.260,00:01:39.390
So let's do that.,00:01:39.390,00:01:40.670
So what's the partial of M?,00:01:40.670,00:01:43.660
"This is the M function, right?",00:01:43.660,00:01:47.180
This was a plus here.,00:01:47.180,00:01:49.380
"What's the partial of this
with respect to y?",00:01:49.380,00:01:52.980
This would be 0.,00:01:52.980,00:01:54.450
"This would be minus 2x,
and then just a 2.",00:01:54.450,00:01:57.980
"So the partial of this with
respect to y is minus 2x.",00:01:57.980,00:02:01.070
"What's the partial of
N with respect to x?",00:02:01.070,00:02:04.490
"This would be 0, this
would be minus 2x.",00:02:04.490,00:02:08.550
So there you have it.,00:02:08.550,00:02:10.470
"The partial of M with respect
to y is equal to the partial",00:02:10.470,00:02:13.620
of N with respect to x.,00:02:13.620,00:02:16.170
My is equal to Nx.,00:02:16.170,00:02:18.870
"So we are dealing with
an exact equation.",00:02:18.870,00:02:24.650
So now we have to find psi.,00:02:24.650,00:02:26.020
"The partial of psi with respect
to x is equal to M,",00:02:29.910,00:02:33.360
"which is equal to 3x squared
minus 2xy plus 2.",00:02:33.360,00:02:39.840
"Take the anti-derivative with
respect to x on both sides,",00:02:39.840,00:02:44.890
"and you get psi is equal to x
to the third minus x squared",00:02:44.890,00:02:51.510
"y-- because y is just a
constant-- plus 2x, plus some",00:02:51.510,00:02:55.740
function of y.,00:02:55.740,00:02:57.270
Right?,00:02:57.270,00:02:57.530
"Because we know psi is a
function of x and y.",00:02:57.530,00:02:59.620
"So when you take a derivative,
when you take a partial with",00:02:59.620,00:03:02.220
"respect to just x, a pure
function of just y would get",00:03:02.220,00:03:05.920
"lost. So it's like the constant,
when we first",00:03:05.920,00:03:08.510
learned taking anti-derivatives.,00:03:08.510,00:03:10.620
"And now, to figure out psi, we
just have to solve for h of y.",00:03:10.620,00:03:13.880
And how do we do that?,00:03:13.880,00:03:15.340
"Well let's take the partial
of psi with respect to y.",00:03:15.340,00:03:20.110
"That's going to be equal
to this right here.",00:03:20.110,00:03:22.140
"So The partial of psi with
respect to y, this is 0, this",00:03:22.140,00:03:25.520
is minus x squared.,00:03:25.520,00:03:26.815
"So it's minus x squared-- this
is o-- plus h prime of y, is",00:03:26.815,00:03:33.210
going to be able to what?,00:03:33.210,00:03:34.290
"That's going to be equal
to our n of x, y.",00:03:34.290,00:03:36.520
It's going to be able to this.,00:03:36.520,00:03:38.970
"And then we can solve
for this.",00:03:38.970,00:03:40.080
"So that's going to be equal
to 6y squared minus x",00:03:40.080,00:03:43.580
squared plus 3.,00:03:43.580,00:03:45.096
"You can add x squared
to both sides to get",00:03:45.096,00:03:47.610
rid of this and this.,00:03:47.610,00:03:50.760
"And then we're left with h
prime of y is equal to 6y",00:03:50.760,00:03:57.290
squared plus 3.,00:03:57.290,00:03:59.650
"Anti-derivative-- so h of y is
equal to what is this-- 2y",00:03:59.650,00:04:06.850
cubed plus 3y.,00:04:06.850,00:04:09.260
"And you could put a plus c
there, but the plus c merges",00:04:09.260,00:04:12.920
"later on when we solve the
differential equation, so you",00:04:12.920,00:04:15.080
"don't have to worry
about it too much.",00:04:15.080,00:04:17.040
So what is our function psi?,00:04:17.040,00:04:18.459
I'll write it in a new color.,00:04:18.459,00:04:20.920
"Our function psi as a function
of x and y is equal to x to",00:04:20.920,00:04:30.240
"the third minus x squared
y plus 2x.",00:04:30.240,00:04:38.150
"Plus h of y, which we
just solved for.",00:04:38.150,00:04:40.800
"So h of y is plus 2y to
the third plus 3y.",00:04:40.800,00:04:46.030
"And then they're could be a plus
c there, but you'll see",00:04:46.030,00:04:47.870
that it doesn't matter much.,00:04:47.870,00:04:50.890
Actually I want to do something,00:04:50.890,00:04:52.390
a little bit different.,00:04:52.390,00:04:53.690
"I'm not just going to chug
through the problem.",00:04:53.690,00:04:54.780
"I want to kind of go back
to the intuition.",00:04:54.780,00:04:56.740
"Because I don't want this to
be completely mechanical.",00:04:56.740,00:04:59.120
"Let me just show you what the
derivative-- using what we",00:04:59.120,00:05:02.310
"knew before you even learned
anything about the partial",00:05:02.310,00:05:08.810
"derivative chain rule-- what is
the derivative of psi with",00:05:08.810,00:05:13.090
respect to x.,00:05:13.090,00:05:14.340
"What is the derivative of
psi with respect to x?",00:05:16.580,00:05:18.770
"Here we just use our implicit
differentiation skills.",00:05:18.770,00:05:22.760
"So the derivative of this-- I'll
do it in a new color-- 3x",00:05:22.760,00:05:27.520
"squared minus-- now we're going
to have to use the chain",00:05:27.520,00:05:30.810
"rule here-- so the derivative
of the first expression with",00:05:30.810,00:05:33.190
"respect to x is-- well, let me
just put the minus sign and I",00:05:33.190,00:05:37.570
"could put like that-- so it's
2x times y plus the first",00:05:37.570,00:05:44.510
"function, x squared times the
derivative of the second",00:05:44.510,00:05:48.080
function with respect to x.,00:05:48.080,00:05:49.260
"Well that's just
y prime, right?",00:05:49.260,00:05:51.710
"It's the derivative of y with
respect to y is 1, times the",00:05:51.710,00:05:55.430
"derivative of y with respect to
x, which is just y prime.",00:05:55.430,00:05:58.890
Fair enough.,00:05:58.890,00:06:00.740
"Plus the derivative of this with
respect to x is easy, 2.",00:06:00.740,00:06:04.940
"Plus the derivative of this
with respect to x.",00:06:04.940,00:06:07.020
"Well let's take the derivative
of this with respect to y",00:06:07.020,00:06:08.710
"first. We're just doing implicit
differentiation of",00:06:08.710,00:06:10.580
the chain rule.,00:06:10.580,00:06:11.770
So this is plus 6y squared.,00:06:11.770,00:06:18.480
"And then we're using the chain
rule, so we took the",00:06:18.480,00:06:20.320
derivative with respect to y.,00:06:20.320,00:06:21.390
"And then you have to multiply
that times the derivative of y",00:06:21.390,00:06:23.500
"with respect x, which
is just y prime.",00:06:23.500,00:06:27.450
"Plus the derivative of this
with respect to why is 3",00:06:27.450,00:06:31.280
"times-- we're just doing the
chain rule-- the derivative of",00:06:31.280,00:06:33.350
y with respect to x.,00:06:33.350,00:06:34.410
So that's y prime.,00:06:34.410,00:06:37.550
"Let's try to see if we
can simplify this.",00:06:37.550,00:06:39.700
"So we get this is equal to 3x
squared minus 2xy plus 2.",00:06:39.700,00:06:51.550
"So that's this term, this
term, and this term.",00:06:51.550,00:06:54.320
"Plus-- let's just put the y
prime outside-- y prime",00:06:56.970,00:07:04.700
"times-- let's see, you have a
negative sign out here-- minus",00:07:04.700,00:07:09.240
"x squared plus 6y
squared plus 3.",00:07:09.240,00:07:18.730
"So this is the derivative of
our psi as we solved it.",00:07:18.730,00:07:23.780
"Look at this closely and notice
that that is the same--",00:07:23.780,00:07:27.670
"hopefully it's the same--
as our original problem.",00:07:27.670,00:07:30.170
"What was our original problem
that we started working with?",00:07:30.170,00:07:32.630
"The original problem was 3x
squared minus 2xy plus 2, plus",00:07:32.630,00:07:45.440
"6y squared minus x square
plus 3, times y",00:07:45.440,00:07:52.010
"prime, is equal to 0.",00:07:52.010,00:07:54.070
"So this was our original
problem.",00:07:54.070,00:07:55.650
"And notice that the derivative
of psi with respect to x just",00:07:55.650,00:07:59.170
"using implicit differentiation
is exactly this.",00:07:59.170,00:08:03.020
"So hopefully this gives you a
little intuition of why we can",00:08:03.020,00:08:04.970
"just rewrite this equation as
the derivative with respect x",00:08:04.970,00:08:11.980
"of psi, which is a function
of x and y, is equal to 0.",00:08:11.980,00:08:16.720
"Because this is the derivative
of psi with respect to x.",00:08:16.720,00:08:19.120
I wrote out here.,00:08:19.120,00:08:19.870
"It's the same thing-- this
right here-- right?",00:08:19.870,00:08:22.830
So that equals 0.,00:08:22.830,00:08:24.710
"So if we take the
anti-derivative of both sides,",00:08:24.710,00:08:27.310
"we know that the solution of
this differential equation is",00:08:27.310,00:08:29.620
"that psi of x and y is equal
to c as the solution.",00:08:29.620,00:08:34.909
"And we know what psi is, so we
just set that equal to c, and",00:08:34.909,00:08:37.780
"we have the implicit-- we have a
solution to the differential",00:08:37.780,00:08:40.470
"equation, I'll just
define implicitly.",00:08:40.470,00:08:42.490
"So the solution-- you don't have
to do this every time.",00:08:42.490,00:08:44.890
"This step right here you
wouldn't have to do if you're",00:08:44.890,00:08:50.010
"taking a test, unless
the teacher",00:08:50.010,00:08:51.190
explicitly asked for it.,00:08:51.190,00:08:52.440
"I just wanted kind of make sure
that you know what you're",00:08:52.440,00:08:55.170
"doing, that you're not just
doing things completely",00:08:55.170,00:08:57.420
mechanically.,00:08:57.420,00:08:58.000
"That you really see that the
derivative of psi really does",00:08:58.000,00:09:01.280
give you-- we solved for psi.,00:09:01.280,00:09:03.560
"And I just wanted to show you
that the derivative of psi",00:09:03.560,00:09:05.490
"with respect to x, just using
implicit differentiation and",00:09:05.490,00:09:08.980
"our standard chain rule,
actually gives you the left",00:09:08.980,00:09:11.700
"hand side of the differential
equation, which was our",00:09:11.700,00:09:14.450
version of problem.,00:09:14.450,00:09:15.640
"And then that's how we know that
that the derivative of",00:09:15.640,00:09:17.600
"psi with respect x is equal
to 0, because our original",00:09:17.600,00:09:20.730
"differential equation
was equal to 0.",00:09:20.730,00:09:23.390
"You take the anti-derivative of
both sides of this, you get",00:09:23.390,00:09:26.950
"psi is equal to C, is
the solution of the",00:09:26.950,00:09:29.510
differential equation.,00:09:29.510,00:09:31.210
"Or if you wanted to write it
out, psi is this thing.",00:09:31.210,00:09:34.190
"Our solution to the differential
equation is x to",00:09:34.190,00:09:36.215
"the third, minus x squared y,
plus 2x, plus 2y to the third,",00:09:36.215,00:09:42.530
"plus 3y, is equal to c, is the
implicitly defined solution of",00:09:42.530,00:09:51.060
"our original differential
equation.",00:09:51.060,00:09:52.940
"Anyway I've run out
of time again.",00:09:52.940,00:09:55.050
"I will see you in
the next video.",00:09:55.050,00:09:56.440
