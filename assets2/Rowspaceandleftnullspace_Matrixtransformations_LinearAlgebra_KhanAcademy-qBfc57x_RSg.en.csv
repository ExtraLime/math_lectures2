"I've got this matrix, A, here,
it's a 2 by 3 matrix.",00:00:00.470,00:00:03.420
"And just as a bit of review,
let's figure out its nullspace",00:00:03.420,00:00:06.210
and its columnspace.,00:00:06.210,00:00:07.920
"So the nullspace of A is the set
of all vectors x that are",00:00:07.920,00:00:13.300
"member of-- let's see we have
3 columns here-- so a member",00:00:13.300,00:00:16.550
"of R3, such that A times the
vector are going to be equal",00:00:16.550,00:00:22.580
to the 0 vector.,00:00:22.580,00:00:25.210
So we can just set this up.,00:00:25.210,00:00:26.820
"Let me just-- we just need to
figure out all of the x's that",00:00:26.820,00:00:29.800
satisfy this in R3.,00:00:29.800,00:00:31.990
"So we take our matrix
A 2, minus 1, minus",00:00:31.990,00:00:35.710
"3, minus 4, 2, 6.",00:00:35.710,00:00:39.120
"Multiply them times some
arbitrary vector in R3 here.",00:00:39.120,00:00:42.965
"So you get x1, x2, x3.",00:00:42.965,00:00:47.060
"And you set them equal
to the 0 vector.",00:00:47.060,00:00:49.210
"It's going to be the
0 vector in R2.",00:00:49.210,00:00:50.930
Because we have 2 rows here.,00:00:50.930,00:00:52.120
"You multiply a 2 by 3 matrix
times a vector in R3, you're",00:00:52.120,00:00:55.770
"going to get a 2 by 1 vector
or 2 by 1 matrix.",00:00:55.770,00:00:59.250
"So you're going to get
the 0 vector in R3.",00:00:59.250,00:01:02.560
"And to solve what is essentially
a system of",00:01:02.560,00:01:04.590
"equations-- you get 2 x1 minus
x2 minus 3 x3 is equal to 0",00:01:04.590,00:01:08.570
and so on and so forth.,00:01:08.570,00:01:09.930
"We can just set up an
augmented matrix.",00:01:09.930,00:01:12.610
"So we can just set up this
augmented matrix right here.",00:01:12.610,00:01:15.890
"2 minus 1 minus 3
minus 4, 2, 6.",00:01:15.890,00:01:21.240
"And then augment it with what
we're trying to set it equal",00:01:21.240,00:01:24.140
to to solve the system.,00:01:24.140,00:01:26.420
"And you know we're going to
perform a bunch of row",00:01:26.420,00:01:29.690
"operations here to put this in
reduced row echelon form.",00:01:29.690,00:01:32.690
"And they're not going to change
the right-hand side of",00:01:32.690,00:01:35.610
this augmented matrix.,00:01:35.610,00:01:36.560
"And that's essentially the
argument as to why the",00:01:36.560,00:01:38.700
"nullspace of the reduced row
echelon form of A is the same",00:01:38.700,00:01:42.390
thing as the nullspace of A.,00:01:42.390,00:01:43.600
"But anyway, that's just
a bit of review.",00:01:43.600,00:01:45.430
"So let's perform some row
operations to solve this a",00:01:45.430,00:01:48.690
little bit better.,00:01:48.690,00:01:50.680
"So, the first thing I might
want to do is divide the",00:01:50.680,00:01:54.600
first row by 2.,00:01:54.600,00:01:57.145
"So if I divide the first row by
2 I get a 1 minus 1/2 minus",00:01:57.145,00:02:02.970
"3/2 and then of course
0 divided by 2 is 0.",00:02:02.970,00:02:07.220
"And let's just divide this row
right here by-- I don't know",00:02:07.220,00:02:14.200
"just to simplify things--
let's divide it by 4.",00:02:14.200,00:02:18.680
"So I'm doing two row operations
in one step.",00:02:18.680,00:02:20.890
And you can do that.,00:02:20.890,00:02:21.560
"I could have done it in
two separate steps.",00:02:21.560,00:02:23.510
"So if we divide it by 4, this
becomes minus 1, 1/2 and then",00:02:23.510,00:02:29.100
"you get 3/2 and then
you get 0.",00:02:29.100,00:02:33.640
"And now, let's keep my
first row the same.",00:02:33.640,00:02:36.570
"I'm going to keep my
first row the same.",00:02:36.570,00:02:38.150
"It's 1 minus 1/2 minus 3/2 and
of course the 0 is the",00:02:38.150,00:02:43.960
right-hand side.,00:02:43.960,00:02:45.070
"Now let's replace my second
row with my second row",00:02:45.070,00:02:47.420
plus my first row.,00:02:47.420,00:02:49.550
"So these are just linear
operations on these guys.",00:02:49.550,00:02:52.580
So negative 1 plus 1 is 0.,00:02:52.580,00:02:55.170
1/2 plus minus 1/2 is 0.,00:02:55.170,00:02:58.190
3/2 plus minus 3/2 is 0.,00:02:58.190,00:03:00.400
"And of course, 0 plus 0 is 0.",00:03:00.400,00:03:04.190
So what are we left with?,00:03:04.190,00:03:05.800
"we're left with this
right here.",00:03:05.800,00:03:07.430
"This is another way of saying
that x1-- let me write it this",00:03:07.430,00:03:13.310
"way-- x1-- I guess the easiest
way to think about it is--",00:03:13.310,00:03:19.940
"you're multiplying the reduced
row echelon form of A now.",00:03:19.940,00:03:23.070
1 minus 1/2 minus 3/2.,00:03:23.070,00:03:26.750
You have a bunch of 0's here.,00:03:26.750,00:03:28.950
"Times x1, x2, x3 is equal
to the R2 0 vector.",00:03:28.950,00:03:37.310
"This is another interpretation
of this augmented matrix.",00:03:37.310,00:03:40.680
"So this is just saying,
this is useless.",00:03:40.680,00:03:43.150
"This is saying 0 times that plus
0 times that plus 0 times",00:03:43.150,00:03:45.540
that is equal to 0.,00:03:45.540,00:03:46.680
"So it's giving us
no information.",00:03:46.680,00:03:47.690
"But this first row tells us
that-- let me switch colors--",00:03:47.690,00:03:54.280
"1 times x1 minus 1/2 times
x2 minus 3/2 times",00:03:54.280,00:04:04.740
x3 is equal to 0.,00:04:04.740,00:04:07.010
"All of the vectors whose
components satisfy this are in",00:04:07.010,00:04:10.240
my nullspace.,00:04:10.240,00:04:11.580
"If I want to write it a little
bit differently I could write",00:04:11.580,00:04:13.950
"as, x1 is equal to 1/2
x2 plus 3/2 x3.",00:04:13.950,00:04:22.079
"Or if I wanted to write my
solution set in vector form, I",00:04:22.079,00:04:25.450
"could write that my nullspace is
going to be the set of all",00:04:25.450,00:04:29.170
"the vectors x1, x2, x3 that
satisfy these conditions.",00:04:29.170,00:04:34.960
That are equal to what?,00:04:34.960,00:04:37.150
"Well, x2 and x3 are
free variables.",00:04:37.150,00:04:39.950
"They're associated with the
non-pivot entries, or the",00:04:39.950,00:04:42.760
"non-pivot columns in our reduced
row echelon form.",00:04:42.760,00:04:45.670
"That is a pivot column
right there.",00:04:45.670,00:04:50.500
So let me write it this way.,00:04:54.720,00:04:55.595
"It's going to be x2
times something",00:04:55.595,00:04:59.670
plus x3 times something.,00:04:59.670,00:05:03.100
"Those are my two
free variables.",00:05:03.100,00:05:05.180
"And we have here,
x1 is 1/2 x2.",00:05:05.180,00:05:08.270
"1/2 times x2 plus
3/2 times x3.",00:05:08.270,00:05:11.690
"x2 is just going to be x2
times 1 plus 0 times x3.",00:05:14.850,00:05:19.790
"x3 is going to be 0 times
x2 plus 1 times x3.",00:05:19.790,00:05:25.060
"So, our nullspace, these
can be any real",00:05:25.060,00:05:29.310
numbers right here.,00:05:29.310,00:05:30.470
They're free variables.,00:05:30.470,00:05:31.780
"So our nullspace is essentially
all of the linear",00:05:31.780,00:05:34.440
"combinations of this
guy and that guy.",00:05:34.440,00:05:37.420
"Or another way to write it, the
nullspace of A is equal to",00:05:37.420,00:05:45.430
"the span, which is the same
thing as all the linear",00:05:45.430,00:05:48.730
"combinations of the
span of 1/2, 1, 0.",00:05:48.730,00:05:55.280
"Notice these are
vectors in R3.",00:05:55.280,00:05:57.050
"And that makes sense because the
nullspace is going to be a",00:05:57.050,00:05:59.620
set of vectors in R3.,00:05:59.620,00:06:00.710
So it's the span of that.,00:06:00.710,00:06:02.310
And that right there.,00:06:02.310,00:06:03.560
"So 3/2, 0, and 1.",00:06:06.080,00:06:10.850
Just like that.,00:06:10.850,00:06:12.460
"And what is the columnspace
of our original matrix, A?",00:06:12.460,00:06:20.600
"So the columnspace of A is equal
to just, the subspace",00:06:20.600,00:06:27.850
"created by all of the linear
combinations of these guys.",00:06:27.850,00:06:30.430
"Or essentially the span
of the column vectors.",00:06:30.430,00:06:32.830
"Is equal to the span
of 2 minus 4 minus",00:06:32.830,00:06:39.310
"1, 2, minus 3, 6.",00:06:39.310,00:06:42.550
"These are all each
separate vectors.",00:06:42.550,00:06:45.180
"So it's the span of
these 3 vectors.",00:06:45.180,00:06:48.360
"Now, these guys might not
be linearly independent.",00:06:48.360,00:06:51.540
"And actually, when you put
this guy in reduced row",00:06:51.540,00:06:54.394
"echelon form, you know that the
basis vectors for this are",00:06:54.394,00:06:57.960
the vectors that are associated,00:06:57.960,00:07:00.010
with our pivot columns.,00:07:00.010,00:07:01.530
"So we have one pivot
column here.",00:07:01.530,00:07:02.760
It's our first column.,00:07:02.760,00:07:03.740
"So we could say that we could
use this as a basis vector.",00:07:03.740,00:07:07.900
And it makes sense.,00:07:07.900,00:07:08.780
"Because this guy right here
is minus 2 times this guy.",00:07:08.780,00:07:11.280
"This guy right here is minus
3/2 times that guy.",00:07:11.280,00:07:15.660
"So these two guys can definitely
be represented as",00:07:15.660,00:07:18.030
"linear combinations
of that guy.",00:07:18.030,00:07:19.870
"So it's equal to the span of
just the vector, 2, minus 4.",00:07:19.870,00:07:30.670
"So if you were to ask me, and
this is the basis for our",00:07:30.670,00:07:34.570
columnspace.,00:07:34.570,00:07:35.300
"So if you wanted to know the
rank-- and this is all a bit",00:07:35.300,00:07:37.160
"of review-- the rank of A is
equal to the number of vectors",00:07:37.160,00:07:43.050
"in our basis for our
columnspace.",00:07:43.050,00:07:45.290
"So it's going to
be equal to 1.",00:07:45.290,00:07:48.370
"Now, everything I just did
is a bit of review.",00:07:48.370,00:07:51.580
"But with the last couple of
videos, we've been dealing",00:07:51.580,00:07:53.740
with transposes.,00:07:53.740,00:07:55.520
"So let's actually figure out
the same ideas for the",00:07:55.520,00:07:58.540
transpose of A.,00:07:58.540,00:07:59.790
"So A transpose looks
like this.",00:08:03.120,00:08:08.160
"A transpose is equal to the
matrix 2, minus 1, minus 3 is",00:08:08.160,00:08:18.790
the first column right there.,00:08:18.790,00:08:20.470
"And then the second column is
going to be minus 4, 2 and 6.",00:08:20.470,00:08:25.910
That is our transpose.,00:08:25.910,00:08:28.240
"So let's figure out the
nullspace and the columnspace",00:08:28.240,00:08:31.100
of our transpose.,00:08:31.100,00:08:32.350
"Let me put this in reduced
row echelon form so",00:08:37.080,00:08:38.940
we can get the nullspace.,00:08:38.940,00:08:41.159
"Let me get the nullspace
of this guy.",00:08:41.159,00:08:42.919
"So we could do the exact
same exercise.",00:08:42.919,00:08:46.900
Let me write it this way.,00:08:46.900,00:08:47.660
"The nullspace of
A transpose-- A",00:08:47.660,00:08:51.090
transpose is a 3 by 2 matrix.,00:08:51.090,00:08:53.480
"So it's equal to all of
the vectors, x, that",00:08:53.480,00:08:57.350
are members of R2.,00:08:57.350,00:09:00.540
"Not R3 anymore-- because now we
are taking the transpose's",00:09:00.540,00:09:03.040
"nullspace-- such that A
transpose times R vectors are",00:09:03.040,00:09:08.810
equal to the 0 vector in R3.,00:09:08.810,00:09:10.880
"And we can do that the same
exact way we did before.",00:09:15.210,00:09:17.930
We set up an augmented matrix.,00:09:17.930,00:09:20.230
"We could just put it in reduced
row echelon form and",00:09:20.230,00:09:23.740
set them all equal to 0.,00:09:23.740,00:09:24.770
So let's just do that.,00:09:24.770,00:09:25.980
"So if we-- let me just put it
in reduced row echelon form.",00:09:25.980,00:09:29.480
"So let me divide my
first row by 2.",00:09:29.480,00:09:35.460
"Let's divide the
first row by 2.",00:09:35.460,00:09:39.460
"I'm just going to put it in
reduced row echelon form.",00:09:39.460,00:09:40.770
"The first row divided
by 2 is 1 minus 2.",00:09:40.770,00:09:44.760
"And then the second row, let
me divide it-- let me just,",00:09:44.760,00:09:48.090
"I'll just keep it the same--
so minus 1, 2.",00:09:48.090,00:09:51.900
"And then this last row,
let me divide it by 3.",00:09:51.900,00:09:54.460
So it becomes minus 1 and 2.,00:09:54.460,00:09:57.490
"And now, let me keep my
first row the same.",00:09:57.490,00:10:00.420
1 minus 2.,00:10:00.420,00:10:02.910
"And now let me replace my second
row with my second row",00:10:02.910,00:10:05.190
plus my first row.,00:10:05.190,00:10:06.050
So minus 1 plus 1 is 0.,00:10:06.050,00:10:07.480
2 plus minus 2 is 0.,00:10:07.480,00:10:09.440
You get some 0's.,00:10:09.440,00:10:10.830
"I'm going to do the same thing
with the third row.",00:10:10.830,00:10:12.160
"Replace it with it plus
the first row.",00:10:12.160,00:10:14.420
"Once again you're going
to get some 0's.",00:10:14.420,00:10:16.800
"So this is the reduced row
echelon form of A transpose.",00:10:16.800,00:10:19.840
"And its nullspace is the same
as A transpose's nullspace.",00:10:24.830,00:10:28.190
"We could say, to find this
nullspace we can find all of",00:10:30.990,00:10:36.770
"the solutions to this equation
times the vectors x1 and x2 is",00:10:36.770,00:10:42.740
"equal to 0, 0, and 0.",00:10:42.740,00:10:50.060
These aren't vectors.,00:10:50.060,00:10:50.830
"These are just entries
right here.",00:10:50.830,00:10:52.650
"0, 0, 0.",00:10:52.650,00:10:54.830
"So these two lines give
us no information, but",00:10:54.830,00:10:57.190
this first one does.,00:10:57.190,00:10:58.140
"So we get 1 times x1-- and
notice, this is the pivot",00:10:58.140,00:11:00.620
column right here.,00:11:00.620,00:11:02.580
It's associated.,00:11:02.580,00:11:03.640
"So x1 is going to be
a pivot variable.",00:11:03.640,00:11:06.930
x2 will be a free variable.,00:11:06.930,00:11:08.530
"And just to be clear that
the first column",00:11:08.530,00:11:10.390
is our pivot column.,00:11:10.390,00:11:11.260
"So if we go back to A transpose,
it's this first",00:11:11.260,00:11:14.420
"column here that is associated
with the pivot column.",00:11:14.420,00:11:17.470
"So when we talk about its
columnspace, this by itself",00:11:17.470,00:11:21.770
will span the columnspace.,00:11:21.770,00:11:23.660
"This is all a review of
what we did before.",00:11:23.660,00:11:25.310
"We're just applying it
to the transpose.",00:11:25.310,00:11:28.190
"Let's go back to
our nullspace.",00:11:28.190,00:11:30.600
"So this tells us that 1 times
x1, so x1, minus 2 times x2,",00:11:30.600,00:11:37.610
is equal to 0.,00:11:37.610,00:11:41.030
"Or we could say that x1 is
equal to 2 times x2.",00:11:41.030,00:11:44.830
"So all of the vectors in R2 that
satisfy these conditions",00:11:44.830,00:11:48.620
"with these entries will be in
the nullspace of A transpose.",00:11:48.620,00:11:52.190
Let me write it this way.,00:11:52.190,00:11:53.440
"So the nullspace of A is going
to be the set of all the",00:11:57.010,00:12:02.700
"vectors-- let me write it here--
the set of all the",00:12:02.700,00:12:05.930
"vectors, x1, x2, that are member
of R2, clearly, such",00:12:05.930,00:12:12.130
"that x1, x2 is going to be
equal to-- well, our free",00:12:12.130,00:12:19.670
"variable is x2-- so it's
x2 times the vector.",00:12:19.670,00:12:26.800
So x1 has to be 2 times x2.,00:12:26.800,00:12:28.860
"And obviously x2-- that's a 2--
is going to be 1 times x2.",00:12:28.860,00:12:34.140
So what is this going to be?,00:12:34.140,00:12:35.710
"Well this is all of the linear
combinations of this vector",00:12:35.710,00:12:38.100
right here.,00:12:38.100,00:12:40.080
"So we could say it's equal to
the span of our vector 2, 1.",00:12:40.080,00:12:50.460
"Now, that's the nullspace.",00:12:50.460,00:12:51.540
"Sorry, this was the nullspace
of A transpose.",00:12:51.540,00:12:54.200
"I have to be very
careful there.",00:12:54.200,00:12:56.090
Now what is the columnspace?,00:12:56.090,00:12:57.970
The columnspace of A tranpose?,00:12:57.970,00:13:01.210
"Well, the columnspace of A
transpose is the set of all",00:13:01.210,00:13:05.690
"vectors spanned by
the columns of A.",00:13:05.690,00:13:07.795
"So you could just say the span
of this column vector and this",00:13:07.795,00:13:10.590
column vector.,00:13:10.590,00:13:11.570
"But we know, when we put it into
reduced row echelon form,",00:13:11.570,00:13:14.020
"only this column vector
was associated",00:13:14.020,00:13:17.620
with a pivot column.,00:13:17.620,00:13:20.210
"So this by itself, this
guy is a linear",00:13:20.210,00:13:22.750
combination of this guy.,00:13:22.750,00:13:23.640
"If you multiply him by
minus 2, you get",00:13:23.640,00:13:26.690
that guy right there.,00:13:26.690,00:13:27.523
"So it's consistent with
everything we've learned.",00:13:27.523,00:13:29.960
"So it equals the span of just
this guy right here.",00:13:29.960,00:13:37.610
"Of just the vector 2, minus
1, and minus 3.",00:13:37.610,00:13:47.380
"That's just a nice, neat
exercise that we did.",00:13:47.380,00:13:50.620
"Notice that your span here,
it's in R3, but it's just",00:13:50.620,00:13:54.260
going to be a line in R3.,00:13:54.260,00:13:57.190
"Maybe in the next video I'll
do a more graphical",00:13:57.190,00:14:00.490
representation of it.,00:14:00.490,00:14:02.130
"But I did this whole exercise to
introduce you to the ideas",00:14:02.130,00:14:06.700
"of the nullspace of your
transpose and the columnspace",00:14:06.700,00:14:09.760
of your transpose.,00:14:09.760,00:14:10.900
"Think about what the
columnspace of",00:14:10.900,00:14:12.140
your transpose is.,00:14:12.140,00:14:13.580
"It's the subspace spanned by
that vector-- sorry-- spanned",00:14:13.580,00:14:19.390
"by this vector and
that vector.",00:14:19.390,00:14:21.810
"And it turns out that this guy
is a multiple of that guy.",00:14:21.810,00:14:24.880
"So we could say just
by that guy.",00:14:24.880,00:14:26.890
"But these were the rows of
our original matrix, A.",00:14:26.890,00:14:31.370
"So we could also view this as
the span of the row vectors of",00:14:31.370,00:14:40.080
our original guy.,00:14:40.080,00:14:41.420
"This is that column that is the
basis for the column span",00:14:41.420,00:14:46.190
of the R transpose matrix.,00:14:46.190,00:14:48.410
"And of course this guy was a
linear combination of that.",00:14:48.410,00:14:51.250
"So we could also view
the column span of",00:14:51.250,00:14:54.600
our transpose matrix.,00:14:54.600,00:14:56.750
It's equivalent to the subspace,00:14:56.750,00:14:58.570
spanned by these rows.,00:14:58.570,00:15:01.010
"Or we could call that
the row space of A.",00:15:01.010,00:15:04.320
Let me write that down.,00:15:04.320,00:15:06.750
"So the columnspace of
A transpose-- and",00:15:06.750,00:15:09.110
this is just general.,00:15:09.110,00:15:10.000
Let me write this generally.,00:15:10.000,00:15:10.840
"It doesn't just apply
to this example.",00:15:10.840,00:15:13.870
"So the columnspace of the
transpose of any matrix, this",00:15:13.870,00:15:18.310
is called the rowspace of A.,00:15:18.310,00:15:24.030
And it's a very natural name.,00:15:24.030,00:15:26.370
"Because if A's got a bunch of
rows, we could call them the",00:15:26.370,00:15:29.850
transpose of some vectors.,00:15:29.850,00:15:31.360
So that's first row.,00:15:31.360,00:15:33.150
You got the second row.,00:15:33.150,00:15:34.390
"All the way to, maybe,
the nth row.",00:15:34.390,00:15:38.430
Just like that.,00:15:38.430,00:15:39.290
These are vector transposes.,00:15:39.290,00:15:40.530
They're really just rows.,00:15:40.530,00:15:42.890
"If you imagine the space
that's spanned by these",00:15:42.890,00:15:45.680
"vectors, by the different rows,
that's essentially the",00:15:45.680,00:15:48.830
columnspace of the transpose.,00:15:48.830,00:15:50.320
"Because when you transpose
it, each of",00:15:50.320,00:15:51.660
these guys become columns.,00:15:51.660,00:15:53.550
"So that's what the
rowspace is.",00:15:53.550,00:15:56.210
"Now, the nullspace of our
transpose-- let's write it",00:15:56.210,00:16:01.100
"like this-- it was all
of the vectors x that",00:16:01.100,00:16:04.430
satisfied this equation.,00:16:04.430,00:16:06.770
"Equals the 0 vector
right there.",00:16:06.770,00:16:11.870
"Now, what happens if we take the
transpose of both sides of",00:16:11.870,00:16:18.460
this equation?,00:16:18.460,00:16:19.710
"Well, we've learned from our
transpose properties, this is",00:16:24.360,00:16:26.900
"equal to the reverse product of
each of those transposes.",00:16:26.900,00:16:30.375
"So this is going to be equal
to, this is a vector, the",00:16:30.375,00:16:33.950
vector x transpose.,00:16:33.950,00:16:38.890
"If this is a column vector
before, now it's going to",00:16:38.890,00:16:41.260
become a row vector.,00:16:41.260,00:16:42.830
"And then, times A transpose
transpose.",00:16:42.830,00:16:47.610
"And that's going to
be equal to the",00:16:47.610,00:16:49.210
transpose of the 0 vector.,00:16:49.210,00:16:52.300
"Or, we could just write
this like this.",00:16:52.300,00:16:56.130
"We could write this as some
matrix-- well let me just",00:16:56.130,00:16:59.910
write it like this.,00:16:59.910,00:17:01.070
"Some column vector x-- what's
the transpose of A transpose?",00:17:01.070,00:17:06.130
Well that's just equal to A.,00:17:06.130,00:17:09.290
"So you take the transpose
of this column vector.",00:17:09.290,00:17:11.940
You now get a row vector.,00:17:11.940,00:17:13.000
"You could view it as a
matrix if you want.",00:17:13.000,00:17:16.079
"If this was a member of Rn, this
is now going to be an 1",00:17:16.079,00:17:21.790
by n matrix.,00:17:21.790,00:17:23.349
If this was a member of Rn.,00:17:23.349,00:17:26.170
"We kind of switched
the orders.",00:17:31.550,00:17:32.930
"And we multiply it times the
transpose of the transpose.",00:17:32.930,00:17:35.990
"We just get the matrix, A.",00:17:35.990,00:17:37.580
"And we set that equal to the
transpose of the 0 vector.",00:17:37.580,00:17:41.230
Now this is interesting.,00:17:41.230,00:17:44.080
"We now have it in terms of
our original matrix, A.",00:17:44.080,00:17:47.290
"Now what did the nullspace of
our matrix, A look like?",00:17:47.290,00:17:49.540
"The nullspace where all of the
vectors x that satisfied this",00:17:49.540,00:17:52.140
equation is equal to 0.,00:17:52.140,00:17:54.180
So the x was on the right.,00:17:54.180,00:17:56.170
"So the nullspace is all the
x's that satisfy this.",00:17:56.170,00:17:59.230
"The nullspace of our transpose
is all of the x's that satisfy",00:17:59.230,00:18:03.780
this equation.,00:18:03.780,00:18:05.030
"So let me say the set of all
of the x's such that A",00:18:07.610,00:18:14.260
"transpose times x
is equal to 0.",00:18:14.260,00:18:18.560
"That is the nullspace
of A transpose.",00:18:18.560,00:18:20.730
"Or we could also write this as
the set of all of the x's such",00:18:24.380,00:18:28.700
"that the transpose of our x
times A is equal to the",00:18:28.700,00:18:33.620
transpose of the 0 vector.,00:18:33.620,00:18:35.970
"And we have another
name for this.",00:18:35.970,00:18:37.880
"This is called the left
nullspace of A.",00:18:37.880,00:18:48.390
"Why is it called the
left nullspace?",00:18:48.390,00:18:50.490
"Because now we have
x on our left.",00:18:50.490,00:18:52.270
"In just a regular nullspace
you have x on the right.",00:18:52.270,00:18:54.920
"But now, if you take the
nullspace of the transpose,",00:18:54.920,00:18:59.660
"using just our transpose
properties, that's equivalent",00:18:59.660,00:19:02.690
"to this transpose vector
right here.",00:19:02.690,00:19:04.890
Actually let me write this.,00:19:04.890,00:19:05.800
The transpose right there.,00:19:05.800,00:19:07.380
"This transpose vector
multiplying A from the",00:19:07.380,00:19:10.140
left-hand side.,00:19:10.140,00:19:11.080
"So all of the x's that satisfy
this is the left nullspace.",00:19:11.080,00:19:14.360
"And it's going to be different
than your nullspace.",00:19:14.360,00:19:17.730
"Notice, your nullspace of A
transpose was the span of this",00:19:17.730,00:19:21.400
right here.,00:19:21.400,00:19:22.750
"This is also the left
nullspace of A.",00:19:22.750,00:19:31.040
"Now what was just the regular
nullspace of A?",00:19:31.040,00:19:33.690
"The regular nullspace of A was
essentially a plane in R3.",00:19:33.690,00:19:38.500
That's the nullspace of A.,00:19:38.500,00:19:41.150
"The left nullspace of A
is just a line in R2.",00:19:41.150,00:19:48.070
Very different things.,00:19:48.070,00:19:51.320
"And if you go to the rowspace,
what is the rowspace of A?",00:19:51.320,00:19:57.330
"The rowspace of A
is a line in R3.",00:19:57.330,00:20:01.570
"The rowspace of A
is a line in R3.",00:20:01.570,00:20:03.980
"Well what is the columnspace
of A?",00:20:03.980,00:20:06.590
"The columnspace of A, right
here, where did I have it?",00:20:06.590,00:20:12.700
"Well, this is the only linearly
independent vector.",00:20:12.700,00:20:16.100
"It was essentially
a line in R2.",00:20:16.100,00:20:18.600
"So they're all very
different things.",00:20:18.600,00:20:20.290
"And we'll study a little bit
more how they're all related.",00:20:20.290,00:20:23.450
"Now there's one thing I
want to relate to you.",00:20:23.450,00:20:26.330
"We figured out that the
rank of this vector",00:20:26.330,00:20:29.980
right here is 1.,00:20:29.980,00:20:32.290
"Because when you put it in
reduced row echelon form there",00:20:32.290,00:20:36.210
was one pivot column.,00:20:36.210,00:20:40.130
"And the basis vectors are those
associated with that",00:20:40.130,00:20:43.780
pivot column.,00:20:43.780,00:20:44.610
"And if you count your basis
vectors, that's your dimension",00:20:44.610,00:20:47.400
of your space.,00:20:47.400,00:20:48.180
"So the dimension of your
columnspace is 1.",00:20:48.180,00:20:50.870
"And that's the same thing
as your rank.",00:20:50.870,00:20:52.760
"Now what is the rank
of A transpose?",00:20:52.760,00:20:55.620
"The rank of A transpose in the
example, when you put it in",00:20:55.620,00:20:58.460
"reduced row echelon form, you
got one linearly independent",00:20:58.460,00:21:02.260
column vector.,00:21:02.260,00:21:03.050
"So the basis for our
columnspace was",00:21:03.050,00:21:05.770
also equal to 1.,00:21:05.770,00:21:07.500
"And in general, that's always
going to be the case.",00:21:07.500,00:21:09.840
"That the rank of A, which
is the dimension of its",00:21:12.860,00:21:17.340
"columnspace, is equal to the
rank of A transpose.",00:21:17.340,00:21:22.590
"And if you think about it,
it makes a lot of sense.",00:21:22.590,00:21:25.360
"To figure out the rank of A, you
essentially figure out how",00:21:25.360,00:21:28.140
"many pivot columns they have.
Or another way to say it is",00:21:28.140,00:21:34.200
"how many pivot entries they
have. When you want to find",00:21:34.200,00:21:45.030
"the rank of your transpose
vector, you're essentially",00:21:45.030,00:21:51.760
"just saying-- and I know this is
maybe getting a little bit",00:21:51.760,00:21:53.810
"confusing-- but when you want
the rank of your transpose",00:21:53.810,00:21:56.150
"vector, you're saying, how
many of these columns are",00:21:56.150,00:21:59.090
linearly independent?,00:21:59.090,00:22:00.080
"Or which of these are linearly
independent?",00:22:00.080,00:22:02.880
"And that's the same question
as saying, how many of your",00:22:02.880,00:22:05.730
"rows up here are linearly
independent?",00:22:05.730,00:22:08.250
"If you want to know how many
columns in your transpose are",00:22:08.250,00:22:10.410
"linearly independent, that's
equivalent to asking how many",00:22:10.410,00:22:13.320
"rows in your original matrix
are linearly independent.",00:22:13.320,00:22:16.300
"And when you put this matrix in
reduced row echelon form,",00:22:16.300,00:22:19.770
"everything in reduced row
echelon form are just row",00:22:19.770,00:22:22.180
