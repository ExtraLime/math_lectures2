"Let's say I had the set of
vectors-- I don't want to do",00:00:00.800,00:00:06.670
it that thick.,00:00:06.670,00:00:08.039
"Let's say one of the vectors is
the vector 2, 3, and then",00:00:08.039,00:00:14.350
"the other vector is
the vector 4, 6.",00:00:14.350,00:00:20.910
"And I just want to answer the
question: what is the span of",00:00:20.910,00:00:24.050
these vectors?,00:00:24.050,00:00:24.685
"And let's assume that these
are position vectors.",00:00:24.685,00:00:26.800
"What are all of the
vectors that these",00:00:26.800,00:00:28.330
two vectors can represent?,00:00:28.330,00:00:30.150
"Well, if you just look at it,
and remember, the span is just",00:00:30.150,00:00:34.000
"all of the vectors that can
be represented by linear",00:00:34.000,00:00:36.150
combinations of these.,00:00:36.150,00:00:37.320
"So it's the set of all the
vectors that if I have some",00:00:37.320,00:00:40.470
"constant times 2 times that
vector plus some other",00:00:40.470,00:00:45.350
"constant times this vector,
it's all the possibilities",00:00:45.350,00:00:49.490
"that I can represent when I just
put a bunch of different",00:00:49.490,00:00:52.970
real numbers for c1 and c2.,00:00:52.970,00:00:55.640
"Now, the first thing you might
realize is that, look, this",00:00:55.640,00:00:58.640
"vector 2, this is just
the same thing as",00:00:58.640,00:01:02.250
2 times this vector.,00:01:02.250,00:01:03.880
"So I could just rewrite
it like this.",00:01:03.880,00:01:06.000
"I could just rewrite it as c1
times the vector 2, 3 plus c2",00:01:06.000,00:01:13.330
"times the vector-- and here,
instead of writing the vector",00:01:13.330,00:01:16.820
"4, 6, I'm going to write 2 times
the vector 2, 3, because",00:01:16.820,00:01:21.720
"this vector is just a multiple
of that vector.",00:01:21.720,00:01:24.310
"So I could write c2 times
2 times 2, 3.",00:01:24.310,00:01:28.330
"I think you see that this is
equivalent to the 4, 6.",00:01:28.330,00:01:32.470
2 times 2 is 4.,00:01:32.470,00:01:33.440
2 times 3 is 6.,00:01:33.440,00:01:35.100
"Well, then we can simplify
this a little bit.",00:01:35.100,00:01:36.850
"We can rewrite this as just c1
plus 2c2, all of that, times",00:01:36.850,00:01:45.320
"2, 3, times our vector 2, 3.",00:01:45.320,00:01:48.610
"And this is just some
arbitrary constant.",00:01:48.610,00:01:50.530
"It's some arbitrary constant
plus 2 times some other",00:01:50.530,00:01:53.290
arbitrary constant.,00:01:53.290,00:01:54.740
"So we can just call this c3
times my vector 2, 3.",00:01:54.740,00:02:00.550
"So in this situation, even
though we started with two",00:02:00.550,00:02:03.110
"vectors, and I said, well, you
know, the span of these two",00:02:03.110,00:02:06.040
"vectors is equal to all of
the vectors that can be",00:02:06.040,00:02:08.419
"constructed with some linear
combination of these, any",00:02:08.419,00:02:12.260
"linear combination of these,
if I just use this",00:02:12.260,00:02:15.180
"substitution right here, can
be reduced to just a scalar",00:02:15.180,00:02:17.890
multiple of my first vector.,00:02:17.890,00:02:19.860
"And I could have gone the
other way around.",00:02:19.860,00:02:21.420
"I could have substituted this
vector as being 1/2 times",00:02:21.420,00:02:23.840
"this, and just made any
combination of scalar multiple",00:02:23.840,00:02:26.460
of the second vector.,00:02:26.460,00:02:27.290
"But the fact is, that instead
of talking about linear",00:02:27.290,00:02:30.910
"combinations of two vectors,
I can reduce this to just a",00:02:30.910,00:02:33.150
"scalar combination
of one vector.",00:02:33.150,00:02:35.840
"And we've seen in R2 a scalar
combination of one vector,",00:02:35.840,00:02:39.130
"especially if they're
position vectors.",00:02:39.130,00:02:40.990
"For example, this vector 2, 3.",00:02:40.990,00:02:42.780
"It's 2, 3.",00:02:42.780,00:02:43.850
It looks like this.,00:02:43.850,00:02:46.440
"All the scalar combinations of
that vector are just going to",00:02:46.440,00:02:49.060
lie along this line.,00:02:49.060,00:02:50.970
"So 2, 3, it's going
to be right there.",00:02:50.970,00:02:53.740
"They're all just going to lie
along that line right there,",00:02:53.740,00:02:56.280
"so along this line going in
both directions forever.",00:02:56.280,00:03:01.480
"And if I take negative
values of 2, 3, I'm",00:03:01.480,00:03:04.000
going to go down here.,00:03:04.000,00:03:05.260
"If I take positive values,
I'm going to go here.",00:03:05.260,00:03:06.695
"If I get really large positive
values, it's",00:03:06.695,00:03:08.100
going to go up here.,00:03:08.100,00:03:09.480
"But I can just represent the
vectors, and when you put them",00:03:09.480,00:03:11.640
"in standard form, their arrows
essentially would",00:03:11.640,00:03:14.190
trace out this line.,00:03:14.190,00:03:16.180
"So you could say that the span
of my set of vectors-- let me",00:03:16.180,00:03:21.430
put it over here.,00:03:21.430,00:03:22.680
"The span of the set of vectors
2, 3 and 4, 6 is",00:03:30.200,00:03:39.510
just this line here.,00:03:39.510,00:03:40.960
"Even though we have
two vectors,",00:03:40.960,00:03:42.930
they're essentially collinear.,00:03:42.930,00:03:44.990
"They're multiples
of each other.",00:03:44.990,00:03:46.160
"I mean, if this is 2, 3, 4,
6 is just this right here.",00:03:46.160,00:03:51.970
"It's just that longer
one right there.",00:03:51.970,00:03:53.530
They're collinear.,00:03:53.530,00:03:55.090
"These two things
are collinear.",00:03:55.090,00:03:56.340
"Now, in this case, when we have
two collinear vectors in",00:03:59.330,00:04:03.500
"R2, essentially their span just
reduces to that line.",00:04:03.500,00:04:09.380
"You can't represent
some vector like--",00:04:09.380,00:04:13.220
let me do a new color.,00:04:13.220,00:04:14.720
"You can't represent this vector
right there with some",00:04:14.720,00:04:18.260
"combination of those
two vectors.",00:04:18.260,00:04:19.890
"There's no way to kind of
break out of this line.",00:04:19.890,00:04:22.540
"So there's no way that you can
represent everything in R2.",00:04:22.540,00:04:24.890
"So the span is just
that line there.",00:04:24.890,00:04:27.330
"Now, a related idea to this,
and notice, you had two",00:04:27.330,00:04:30.310
"vectors, but it kind of reduced
to one vector when you",00:04:30.310,00:04:32.650
took its linear combinations.,00:04:32.650,00:04:34.670
"The related idea here is that we
call this set-- we call it",00:04:34.670,00:04:38.460
linearly dependent.,00:04:38.460,00:04:40.650
"Let me write that down:
linearly dependent.",00:04:40.650,00:04:46.330
"This is a linearly
dependent set.",00:04:46.330,00:04:52.000
"And linearly dependent just
means that one of the vectors",00:04:52.000,00:04:55.350
"in the set can be represented
by some combination of the",00:04:55.350,00:04:59.040
other vectors in the set.,00:04:59.040,00:05:00.850
"A way to think about it is
whichever vector you pick that",00:05:00.850,00:05:02.980
"can be represented by the
others, it's not adding any",00:05:02.980,00:05:05.450
"new directionality or any
new information, right?",00:05:05.450,00:05:08.520
"In this case, we already had
a vector that went in this",00:05:08.520,00:05:10.160
"direction, and when you throw
this 4, 6 on there, you're",00:05:10.160,00:05:13.270
"going in the same direction,
just scaled up.",00:05:13.270,00:05:15.030
"So it's not giving us any new
dimension, letting us break",00:05:15.030,00:05:19.740
"out of this line, right?",00:05:19.740,00:05:21.050
"And you can imagine in three
space, if you have one vector",00:05:21.050,00:05:23.990
"that looks like this and another
vector that looks like",00:05:23.990,00:05:26.790
"this, two vectors that aren't
collinear, they're going to",00:05:26.790,00:05:29.110
"define a kind of two-dimensional
space.",00:05:29.110,00:05:32.410
"They can define a
two-dimensional space.",00:05:32.410,00:05:34.380
"Let's say that this is
the plane defined",00:05:34.380,00:05:35.840
by those two vectors.,00:05:35.840,00:05:37.450
"In order to define R3, a third
vector in that set can't be",00:05:37.450,00:05:42.270
"coplanar with those
two, right?",00:05:42.270,00:05:45.140
"If this third vector is coplanar
with these, it's not",00:05:45.140,00:05:48.070
adding any more directionality.,00:05:48.070,00:05:50.050
"So this set of three
vectors will",00:05:50.050,00:05:51.980
also be linearly dependent.,00:05:51.980,00:05:53.690
"And another way to think about
it is that these two purple",00:05:53.690,00:05:56.620
"vectors span this plane, span
the plane that they define,",00:05:56.620,00:06:02.230
"essentially, right?",00:06:02.230,00:06:03.610
"Anything in this plane going in
any direction can be-- any",00:06:03.610,00:06:07.500
"vector in this plane, when we
say span it, that means that",00:06:07.500,00:06:11.410
"any vector can be represented
by a linear combination of",00:06:11.410,00:06:13.620
"this vector and this vector,
which means that if this",00:06:13.620,00:06:16.810
"vector is on that plane, it can
be represented as a linear",00:06:16.810,00:06:19.960
"combination of that vector
and that vector.",00:06:19.960,00:06:22.390
"So this green vector I added
isn't going to add anything to",00:06:22.390,00:06:26.720
"the span of our set of vectors
and that's because this is a",00:06:26.720,00:06:32.680
linearly dependent set.,00:06:32.680,00:06:34.160
"This one can be represented by a
sum of that one and that one",00:06:34.160,00:06:37.880
"because this one and this
one span this plane.",00:06:37.880,00:06:41.620
"In order for the span of these
three vectors to kind of get",00:06:41.620,00:06:45.190
"more dimensionality or start
representing R3, the third",00:06:45.190,00:06:50.170
"vector will have to break
out of that plane.",00:06:50.170,00:06:53.090
"It would have to break
out of that plane.",00:06:53.090,00:06:56.590
"And if a vector is breaking out
of that plane, that means",00:06:56.590,00:07:00.020
"it's a vector that can't be
represented anywhere on that",00:07:00.020,00:07:02.370
"plane, so it's outside of the
span of those two vectors.",00:07:02.370,00:07:05.310
"Where it's outside, it can't
be represented by a linear",00:07:05.310,00:07:07.400
"combination of this
one and this one.",00:07:07.400,00:07:09.360
"So if you had a vector of this
one, this one, and this one,",00:07:09.360,00:07:13.190
"and just those three, none of
these other things that I",00:07:13.190,00:07:15.250
"drew, that would be linearly
independent.",00:07:15.250,00:07:18.980
"Let me draw a couple more
examples for you.",00:07:18.980,00:07:22.950
"That one might have been
a little too abstract.",00:07:22.950,00:07:25.430
"So, for example, if I have the
vectors 2, 3 and I have the",00:07:25.430,00:07:36.110
"vector 7, 2, and I have the
vector 9, 5, and I were to ask",00:07:36.110,00:07:46.330
"you, are these linearly
dependent or independent?",00:07:46.330,00:07:50.010
"So at first you say, well, you
know, it's not trivial.",00:07:50.010,00:07:52.470
"Let's see, this isn't a scalar
multiple of that.",00:07:52.470,00:07:55.020
"That doesn't look like a scalar
multiple of either of",00:07:55.020,00:07:57.060
the other two.,00:07:57.060,00:07:57.800
"Maybe they're linearly
independent.",00:07:57.800,00:08:00.320
"But then, if you kind of inspect
them, you kind of see",00:08:00.320,00:08:02.610
"that v, if we call this v1,
vector 1, plus vector 2, if we",00:08:02.610,00:08:07.600
"call this vector 2, is
equal to vector 3.",00:08:07.600,00:08:10.810
"So vector 3 is a linear
combination of",00:08:10.810,00:08:13.910
these other two vectors.,00:08:13.910,00:08:15.250
"So this is a linearly
dependent set.",00:08:15.250,00:08:25.180
"And if we were to show it, draw
it in kind of two space,",00:08:25.180,00:08:30.770
"and it's just a general idea
that-- well, let me see.",00:08:30.770,00:08:34.010
Let me draw it in R2.,00:08:34.010,00:08:35.330
"There's a general idea that if
you have three two-dimensional",00:08:35.330,00:08:38.409
"vectors, one of them is
going to be redundant.",00:08:38.409,00:08:41.350
"Well, one of them definitely
will be redundant.",00:08:41.350,00:08:44.070
"For example, if we do 2, 3, if
we do the vector 2, 3, that's",00:08:44.070,00:08:49.030
the first one right there.,00:08:49.030,00:08:50.872
"I draw it in the standard
position.",00:08:50.872,00:08:53.730
"And I draw the vector 7, 2 right
there, I could show you",00:08:53.730,00:09:06.010
"that any point in R2 can be
represented by some linear",00:09:06.010,00:09:13.090
"combination of these
two vectors.",00:09:13.090,00:09:14.450
"We can even do a kind of a
graphical representation.",00:09:14.450,00:09:17.570
"I've done that in the previous
video, so I could write that",00:09:17.570,00:09:20.750
"the span of v1 and v2
is equal to R2.",00:09:20.750,00:09:30.630
"That means that every vector,
every position here can be",00:09:30.630,00:09:35.100
"represented by some linear
combination of these two guys.",00:09:35.100,00:09:39.530
"Now, the vector 9,
5, it is in R2.",00:09:39.530,00:09:49.830
"It is in R2, right?",00:09:49.830,00:09:51.730
Clearly.,00:09:51.730,00:09:52.060
"I just graphed it
on this plane.",00:09:52.060,00:09:53.490
"It's in our two-dimensional,
real number space.",00:09:53.490,00:09:56.870
"Or I guess we could call it
a space or in our set R2.",00:09:56.870,00:10:02.100
It's there.,00:10:02.100,00:10:03.280
It's right there.,00:10:03.280,00:10:04.720
"So we just said that anything in
R2 can be represented by a",00:10:04.720,00:10:07.930
"linear combination of
those two guys.",00:10:07.930,00:10:09.760
"So clearly, this is in R2, so
it can be represented as a",00:10:09.760,00:10:12.720
linear combination.,00:10:12.720,00:10:13.850
"So hopefully, you're starting
to see the relationship",00:10:13.850,00:10:15.940
"between span and linear
independence or linear",00:10:15.940,00:10:20.810
dependence.,00:10:20.810,00:10:21.370
Let me do another example.,00:10:21.370,00:10:24.100
"Let's say I have the vectors--
let me do a new color.",00:10:24.100,00:10:30.263
"Let's say I have the vector--
and this one will be a little",00:10:30.263,00:10:32.620
"bit obvious-- 7, 0, so that's
my v1, and then I have my",00:10:32.620,00:10:38.140
"second vector, which
is 0, minus 1.",00:10:38.140,00:10:42.060
That's v2.,00:10:42.060,00:10:43.850
"Now, is this set linearly
independent?",00:10:43.850,00:10:49.170
Is it linearly independent?,00:10:49.170,00:10:50.840
"Well, can I represent
either of these as a",00:10:50.840,00:10:53.370
combination of the other?,00:10:53.370,00:10:54.400
"And really when I say as a
combination, you'd have to",00:10:54.400,00:10:56.020
"scale up one to get the other,
because there's only two",00:10:56.020,00:10:58.270
vectors here.,00:10:58.270,00:10:59.820
"If I am trying to add up to this
vector, the only thing I",00:10:59.820,00:11:02.310
"have to deal with is this
one, so all I can",00:11:02.310,00:11:03.730
do is scale it up.,00:11:03.730,00:11:05.030
"Well, there's nothing
I can do.",00:11:05.030,00:11:06.850
"No matter what I multiply this
vector by, you know, some",00:11:06.850,00:11:10.190
"constant and add it to itself
or scale it up, this term",00:11:10.190,00:11:14.520
"right here is always
going to be zero.",00:11:14.520,00:11:16.400
It's always going to be zero.,00:11:16.400,00:11:17.560
"So nothing I can multiply
this by is going to",00:11:17.560,00:11:20.300
get me to this vector.,00:11:20.300,00:11:21.970
"Likewise, no matter what I
multiply this vector by, the",00:11:21.970,00:11:25.820
"top term is always
going to be zero.",00:11:25.820,00:11:27.590
"So there's no way I could
get to this vector.",00:11:27.590,00:11:29.920
"So both of these vectors,
there's no way that you can",00:11:29.920,00:11:32.020
"represent one as a combination
of the other.",00:11:32.020,00:11:34.720
"So these two are linearly
independent.",00:11:34.720,00:11:37.970
"And you can even see
it if we graph it.",00:11:37.970,00:11:41.220
"One is 7, 0, which
is like that.",00:11:41.220,00:11:44.245
"Let me do it in a non-yellow
color.",00:11:44.245,00:11:46.195
"7, 0.",00:11:48.990,00:11:50.140
"And one is 0, minus 1.",00:11:50.140,00:11:54.250
"And I think you can clearly see
that if you take a linear",00:11:54.250,00:11:57.030
"combination of any of these
two, you can represent",00:11:57.030,00:11:59.780
anything in R2.,00:11:59.780,00:12:00.780
"So the span of these, just to
kind of get used to our notion",00:12:00.780,00:12:04.320
"of span of v1 and v2,
is equal to R2.",00:12:04.320,00:12:09.550
"Now, this is another interesting
point to make.",00:12:09.550,00:12:12.790
"I said the span of
v1 and v2 is R2.",00:12:12.790,00:12:15.640
"Now what is the span of
v1, v2, and v3 in",00:12:15.640,00:12:22.850
this example up here?,00:12:22.850,00:12:24.810
I already told you.,00:12:24.810,00:12:25.550
"I already showed you that
this third vector can be",00:12:25.550,00:12:28.170
"represented as a linear
combination of these two.",00:12:28.170,00:12:30.030
"It's actually just these
two summed up.",00:12:30.030,00:12:32.050
I can even draw it right here.,00:12:32.050,00:12:33.210
"It's just those two
vectors summed up.",00:12:33.210,00:12:34.620
"So it clearly can be represented
as a linear",00:12:34.620,00:12:37.280
combination of those two.,00:12:37.280,00:12:38.860
So what's its span?,00:12:38.860,00:12:40.670
"Well, the fact that this is
redundant means that it",00:12:40.670,00:12:43.270
doesn't change its span.,00:12:43.270,00:12:44.200
"It doesn't change all of the
possible linear combinations.",00:12:44.200,00:12:47.000
"So its span is also
going to be R2.",00:12:47.000,00:12:50.500
"It's just that this was
more vectors than you",00:12:50.500,00:12:52.540
needed to span R2.,00:12:52.540,00:12:54.210
"R2 is a two-dimensional space,
and you needed two vectors.",00:12:54.210,00:12:57.210
"So this was kind of a more
efficient way of providing a",00:12:57.210,00:13:02.180
"basis, and I haven't defined
basis formally, yet, but I",00:13:02.180,00:13:06.830
"just want to use it a little
conversationally, and then",00:13:06.830,00:13:09.720
"it'll make sense to you when
I define it formally.",00:13:09.720,00:13:11.780
"This provides a better basis, or
this provides a basis, kind",00:13:11.780,00:13:15.060
"of a non-redundant set of
vectors that can represent R2.",00:13:15.060,00:13:19.460
"While this one, right
here, is redundant.",00:13:19.460,00:13:22.910
"So it's not a good
basis for R2.",00:13:22.910,00:13:27.620
"Let me give you one more example
in three dimensions.",00:13:27.620,00:13:30.060
"And then in the next video,
I'm going to make a more",00:13:30.060,00:13:31.940
"formal definition of linear
dependence or independence.",00:13:31.940,00:13:36.400
"So let's say that I had
the vector 2, 0, 0.",00:13:36.400,00:13:42.205
"Let me make a similar argument
that I made up there: the",00:13:42.205,00:13:45.470
"vector 2, 0, 0, the vector 0, 1,
0, and the vector 0, 0, 7.",00:13:45.470,00:13:53.330
"We are now in R3, right?",00:13:56.560,00:13:58.050
"Each of these are
three-dimensional vectors.",00:13:58.050,00:14:00.550
"Now, are these linear dependent
or linearly",00:14:00.550,00:14:03.290
independent?,00:14:03.290,00:14:04.010
"Sorry, are they linearly
dependent or independent?",00:14:04.010,00:14:07.080
"Well, there's no way with some
combination of these two",00:14:07.080,00:14:10.960
"vectors that I can end up with
a non-zero term right here to",00:14:10.960,00:14:14.880
"make this third vector, right?",00:14:14.880,00:14:16.160
"Because no matter what I
multiply this one by and this",00:14:16.160,00:14:18.160
"one by, this last term
is going to be zero.",00:14:18.160,00:14:20.400
"So this is kind of adding
a new direction",00:14:20.400,00:14:22.690
to our set of vectors.,00:14:22.690,00:14:24.640
"Likewise, there's nothing
I can do-- there's no",00:14:24.640,00:14:26.810
"combination of this guy and
this guy that I can get a",00:14:26.810,00:14:30.720
non-zero term here.,00:14:30.720,00:14:32.430
"And finally, no combination of
this guy and this guy that I",00:14:32.430,00:14:34.930
can get a non-zero term here.,00:14:34.930,00:14:36.680
"So this set is linearly
independent.",00:14:36.680,00:14:39.035
"And if you were to graph these
in three dimensions, you would",00:14:43.940,00:14:46.550
"see that none of these--
these three do not",00:14:46.550,00:14:50.610
lie on the same plane.,00:14:50.610,00:14:51.690
"Obviously, any two of them lie
on the same plane, but if you",00:14:51.690,00:14:54.580
"were to actually graph
it, you get 2, 0.",00:14:54.580,00:14:56.730
Let me say that that's x-axis.,00:14:56.730,00:14:58.350
"That's 2, 0, 0.",00:14:58.350,00:15:00.690
"Then you have this, 0, 1, 0.",00:15:00.690,00:15:02.510
Maybe that's the y-axis.,00:15:02.510,00:15:03.700
"And then you have 0, 0, 7.",00:15:03.700,00:15:05.370
"It would look something
like this.",00:15:05.370,00:15:07.070
"So it almost looks like, your
three-dimensional axes, it",00:15:07.070,00:15:09.300
"almost looks like the
vectors i, j, k.",00:15:09.300,00:15:10.860
"They're just scaled
up a little bit.",00:15:10.860,00:15:12.390
"But you can always correct
that by just scaling them",00:15:12.390,00:15:15.410
"down, right?",00:15:15.410,00:15:16.160
"Because we care about any linear
combination of these.",00:15:16.160,00:15:19.240
"So the span of these three
vectors right here, because",00:15:19.240,00:15:25.090
"they're all adding new
directionality, is R3.",00:15:25.090,00:15:28.580
"Anyway, I thought I would leave
you there in this video.",00:15:31.490,00:15:33.690
"I realize I've been making
longer and longer videos, and",00:15:33.690,00:15:35.950
"I want to get back in the habit
of making shorter ones.",00:15:35.950,00:15:38.230
"In the next video, I'm going
to make a more formal",00:15:38.230,00:15:40.270
"definition of linear dependence,
and we'll do a",00:15:40.270,00:15:43.450
bunch more examples.,00:15:43.450,00:15:45.200
