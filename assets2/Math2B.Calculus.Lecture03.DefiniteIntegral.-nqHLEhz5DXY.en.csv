good afternoon,00:00:05.390,00:00:08.110
so today we'll cover section ,00:00:08.110,00:00:09.390
"5.2, definitive integral ",00:00:09.390,00:00:16.390
so we'll start from a very important definition ,00:00:21.710,00:00:24.420
we'll define the definitive integral,00:00:24.420,00:00:27.940
let's assume that we have a function F,00:00:27.940,00:00:31.689
defined on an interval ,00:00:31.689,00:00:35.420
"AB, okay, then we'll take ",00:00:35.420,00:00:40.489
this interval and form a partition ,00:00:40.489,00:00:45.300
"that is with sin points x_1, x_2",00:00:53.070,00:00:57.370
x_3 and so on ,00:00:57.370,00:01:01.059
x now coincides with A and x ,00:01:01.059,00:01:04.570
"n coincides with b, okay ",00:01:04.570,00:01:08.600
"then so make a partition x_0, x_1, ",00:01:08.600,00:01:12.190
"x_n, then we'll pick ",00:01:12.190,00:01:17.049
sample points. Pick sampling points ,00:01:17.049,00:01:20.799
"which we'll call x_1*, x_2*,  ",00:01:27.770,00:01:31.799
x_n*. Basically ,00:01:31.799,00:01:35.530
inside each sub-interval ,00:01:35.530,00:01:38.579
"the cycle x_1*, x_2*",00:01:38.579,00:01:43.200
and so on. remember these points ,00:01:43.200,00:01:46.479
"they could be either the leftmost point of this subinterval, the rightmost point of this subinterval ",00:01:46.479,00:01:50.960
"or somewhere in between. Okay, ",00:01:51.780,00:01:54.939
then we say that ,00:01:54.939,00:02:01.420
define ,00:02:01.420,00:02:01.920
an integral ,00:02:01.920,00:02:05.869
from a to b ,00:02:05.869,00:02:09.970
f(x) dx to be equal to ,00:02:09.970,00:02:14.310
the limit as n goes to infinity ,00:02:14.310,00:02:18.370
of the following sum. It goes from 1 to n ,00:02:18.370,00:02:22.450
f(x_1)* ,00:02:22.450,00:02:25.700
delta x. So here delta x ,00:02:25.700,00:02:30.230
normally if they're equal length it's b-a ,00:02:30.230,00:02:34.190
over n. That's the length of individual intervals. ,00:02:34.190,00:02:37.420
"okay, so this ",00:02:37.420,00:02:40.470
definition is valid if,00:02:40.470,00:02:43.610
the limit exists,00:02:43.610,00:02:48.549
and is,00:02:48.549,00:02:51.959
the same for all,00:02:51.959,00:02:57.420
choices ,00:02:57.420,00:03:00.530
of sampling points. So for instance it could happen ,00:03:00.530,00:03:07.530
if I choose the sampling points to be ,00:03:09.349,00:03:12.819
"the left side of each interval, the left hand rule, and I take the limit, I get a ",00:03:12.819,00:03:16.189
number,00:03:16.189,00:03:16.709
then I choose them to be the right side of each interval ,00:03:16.709,00:03:20.060
"and if the limit is different, then this definition doesn't make sense ",00:03:20.060,00:03:23.629
"so it only makes sense if the limit exists, and if it's the same for any ",00:03:23.629,00:03:27.019
choice,00:03:27.019,00:03:27.599
of all of the sampling points ,00:03:27.599,00:03:31.480
so I'm going to start by making an introduction ,00:03:31.480,00:03:34.970
so let's look at this new symbol and,00:03:34.970,00:03:38.599
"talk about its components. First of all, ",00:03:38.599,00:03:42.379
this guy here is the integral sign ,00:03:42.379,00:03:46.650
 ,00:03:46.650,00:03:49.909
and it looks like an elongated s ,00:03:49.909,00:03:54.540
why s? Because it's equal to a sum ,00:03:54.540,00:03:58.260
so it's the limit of a sum. So the symbol s comes from that word. ,00:03:58.260,00:04:02.370
and and b ,00:04:02.370,00:04:05.590
are the limits of integration ,00:04:05.590,00:04:12.189
limits of integration ,00:04:12.189,00:04:17.780
this heref,00:04:17.780,00:04:21.450
is called the integrand ,00:04:21.450,00:04:24.580
and finally ,00:04:24.580,00:04:30.710
this differential here ,00:04:30.710,00:04:37.710
tells me what is my independent variable,00:04:37.890,00:04:42.190
okay my horizontal axis ,00:04:42.190,00:04:45.820
is called X in this case and this,00:04:45.820,00:04:49.260
"variable has to match, you know, the variable ",00:04:49.260,00:04:52.880
upon which the function f depends. ,00:04:52.880,00:04:56.800
We'll call this variable the silent variable of integration ,00:04:56.800,00:05:00.090
so let me show you. So ,00:05:00.090,00:05:03.420
the limit from a to b ,00:05:03.420,00:05:06.860
f(x)dx,00:05:06.860,00:05:09.930
"actually can be written as the integral
of ",00:05:09.930,00:05:13.760
f(y)dy. Or I could insert any lette r,00:05:13.760,00:05:18.550
and the answer won't change. Why is that? ,00:05:18.550,00:05:23.320
"well if you look look at the right hand
side of this definition",00:05:23.320,00:05:28.500
okay and if you take,00:05:28.500,00:05:31.960
f to be x^2,00:05:31.960,00:05:35.710
"remember, we actually did this exercise last time ",00:05:35.710,00:05:38.990
we said let's consider ,00:05:38.990,00:05:42.200
the parabola f=x^2,00:05:42.200,00:05:45.970
and we actually calculated this sum. What was it equal to? ,00:05:45.970,00:05:50.220
"1/3, right? So we got a number. Does this number depend on x? ",00:05:50.220,00:05:55.000
"no, it's a number. It's not a function. So whatever you get as an answer here ",00:05:55.000,00:05:59.300
does not depend on x ,00:05:59.300,00:06:01.100
so x cannot appear in the final answer. So you can replace it by anything else ,00:06:01.100,00:06:04.830
the answer won't change. So we'll call it a silent ,00:06:04.830,00:06:09.240
variable,00:06:09.240,00:06:12.560
of integration ,00:06:12.560,00:06:17.340
so x or y or anything else ,00:06:17.340,00:06:21.110
questions? ,00:06:21.110,00:06:25.310
"question? student: Yeah, I'm a little bit confused ",00:06:25.310,00:06:28.390
most of the time we plug in x as the independent variable and ,00:06:28.390,00:06:31.430
"not y, so in the case of the right hand side ",00:06:31.430,00:06:35.710
are we plugging in a y value of a and a y value of b? Instructor: y is just a variable. ,00:06:35.710,00:06:40.470
I can call it alpha. I can call it... ,00:06:40.470,00:06:44.350
"t. Absolutely, yeah. So you're right, usually the convention is that usually ",00:06:44.350,00:06:49.620
"when you draw a graph, this is y, this is x ",00:06:49.620,00:06:53.160
"so not to get confused, we don't often use y there ",00:06:53.160,00:06:56.910
but we might. We can. ,00:06:56.910,00:07:00.350
Okay. So finally ,00:07:00.350,00:07:03.390
this guy here also has a name ,00:07:03.390,00:07:06.460
this is called the Reinmann sum ,00:07:06.460,00:07:13.460
and we'll practice to evaluate such sums ,00:07:14.820,00:07:18.500
today. Okay? ,00:07:18.500,00:07:21.580
so what is the meaning of this new object? ,00:07:21.580,00:07:26.170
let me do it here ,00:07:26.170,00:07:29.550
so if,00:07:29.550,00:07:33.680
the function of x is non-negative ,00:07:33.680,00:07:38.370
on the interval [ab],00:07:38.370,00:07:42.780
then the integral of ,00:07:42.780,00:07:47.080
f(x)dx what is the meaning of that? ,00:07:47.080,00:07:50.760
do you remember? Exactly ,00:07:50.760,00:07:54.310
because we already saw this right hand side. We only did it for non-negative ,00:07:54.310,00:07:58.630
functions,00:07:58.630,00:07:59.600
"and we said, ""that's the area.""  Remember, we split it ",00:07:59.600,00:08:02.610
into a number of vertical ,00:08:02.610,00:08:05.720
rectangles. We calculated the area . So this is ,00:08:05.720,00:08:10.210
the area under ,00:08:10.210,00:08:14.270
the curve f,00:08:14.270,00:08:17.650
f(x) between ,00:08:17.650,00:08:20.940
a and b. So it has a very clear meaning,00:08:20.960,00:08:25.470
for non negative f,00:08:25.470,00:08:28.480
okay now what happens if f,00:08:28.480,00:08:32.390
"changes sign so for instance we can
consider",00:08:32.390,00:08:37.630
this kind of function ,00:08:37.630,00:08:41.459
"see this takes both positive and
negative values",00:08:41.459,00:08:45.290
"so if you look at the definition you can
see we can do the Reinmann sum ",00:08:45.290,00:08:50.330
"we can do these, so first we have these rectangles ",00:08:50.330,00:08:54.009
"and we have these rectangles, okay, ",00:08:54.009,00:08:57.060
"and if you look at the formula they all
have the same base",00:08:57.060,00:09:01.550
"they all have different height, and the height of these is actually negative ",00:09:01.550,00:09:05.610
"so we can do these separately. We can group these together, and we get the area ",00:09:05.610,00:09:09.149
area under this,00:09:09.149,00:09:10.120
"part of the curve, and then this here ",00:09:10.120,00:09:13.860
"gives me also an area, but it has a negative sign because ",00:09:13.860,00:09:17.279
"each of the the components here has a
negative",00:09:17.279,00:09:20.790
height. So if we call this area ,00:09:20.790,00:09:24.660
A1 and this area A2,00:09:24.660,00:09:28.370
then the integral of ,00:09:28.370,00:09:31.569
f(x)dx is equal to A1 minus ,00:09:31.569,00:09:35.279
A2. This is called the net area ,00:09:35.279,00:09:39.459
or the signed area,00:09:39.459,00:09:43.089
net area,00:09:43.089,00:09:46.389
or signed,00:09:46.389,00:09:50.480
area,00:09:50.480,00:09:57.480
so normally we will assume that the function f,00:09:59.900,00:10:03.130
that appears under the integral is either continuous,00:10:03.130,00:10:07.020
"or it has a finite number of
discontinuities",00:10:07.020,00:10:10.470
okay ,00:10:10.470,00:10:13.470
and next I'm going to show you an example ,00:10:13.470,00:10:16.470
 of using this definition to calculate,00:10:16.470,00:10:20.100
the integral. And this example ,00:10:20.100,00:10:24.930
is such that we will know the answer ,00:10:24.930,00:10:29.190
before we did any calculations,00:10:29.190,00:10:32.330
so in this example ,00:10:32.330,00:10:35.520
we said ,00:10:35.520,00:10:38.820
that f(x) is x-3,00:10:38.820,00:10:42.770
we'll say that ,00:10:42.770,00:10:46.460
x belongs on the interval from 1 to 4,00:10:46.460,00:10:50.870
 ,00:10:50.870,00:10:54.200
evaluate ,00:10:54.200,00:10:58.750
f(x) ,00:10:58.750,00:11:01.980
dx by using ,00:11:01.980,00:11:07.800
the definition. Before I use the definition I'm going to give you an answer ,00:11:07.800,00:11:14.450
so this function,00:11:14.450,00:11:19.970
is a straight line,00:11:19.970,00:11:23.570
and ,00:11:23.570,00:11:26.570
"this is what allows me to give you an
answer",00:11:26.570,00:11:30.750
"or you are going to give me an answer, okay? ",00:11:30.750,00:11:34.800
so let's plot f(x) which is ,00:11:34.800,00:11:38.680
"x-3 as a function of x. At 0,",00:11:38.680,00:11:42.520
we'll get -3. It crosses the horizontal axis ,00:11:42.520,00:11:46.820
"at 3, okay, ",00:11:46.820,00:11:53.820
"its value at 4 is equal to 1, it's value at ",00:11:55.890,00:12:00.940
1 is given at 2 ,00:12:00.940,00:12:04.150
so,00:12:04.160,00:12:09.910
we're interested in ,00:12:09.910,00:12:14.150
the integral of this function,00:12:14.150,00:12:17.880
between 1 and 4. Okay? ,00:12:17.880,00:12:21.820
"so we talked about that, it actually does change sign, ",00:12:21.820,00:12:25.070
"so to calculate it simply, ",00:12:25.070,00:12:28.600
"we can calculate this area and you can
calculate this area ",00:12:28.600,00:12:35.579
"and remember that this area comes with a
negative sign, right? ",00:12:35.579,00:12:38.650
so let's call this A1,00:12:38.650,00:12:41.920
"the positive area, let's call this A2",00:12:41.920,00:12:45.070
and let's calculate them from geometric considerations. This is easier ,00:12:45.070,00:12:49.339
what's the area of this object? It's a triangle ,00:12:49.339,00:12:53.290
"1/2. It has a base of 1, a height of 1 ",00:12:53.290,00:12:57.370
so it's 1x1 over 2,00:12:57.370,00:13:00.430
is 1/2. This one- what's the area of this? ,00:13:00.430,00:13:04.780
so,00:13:04.780,00:13:08.160
2. so this is 2,00:13:08.160,00:13:11.700
times 2 over 2 ,00:13:11.700,00:13:15.670
is 2. So what's the answer? ,00:13:15.670,00:13:19.360
we have A1 minus,00:13:19.360,00:13:23.050
A2 is 1/2 minus 2,00:13:23.050,00:13:27.690
is -3/2. So whatever ,00:13:27.690,00:13:31.420
"magic we're doing here, we're expecting to
get this answer",00:13:31.420,00:13:35.089
so let's keep that in mind ,00:13:35.089,00:13:39.339
and perform the calculations. We're going to use this definition,00:13:39.339,00:13:46.339
 in order to use the definitions,00:13:47.060,00:13:54.060
"I have to know delta x, ",00:13:55.860,00:13:58.959
"x_i*, and f of that amount. So let's do it step by step ",00:13:58.959,00:14:02.900
the easiest one is delta x ,00:14:02.900,00:14:07.610
we have to go b,00:14:07.610,00:14:10.920
"minus A over n, so it's 4",00:14:10.920,00:14:14.300
minus 1 over n is 3,00:14:14.300,00:14:17.339
over n. Questions? ,00:14:17.339,00:14:21.949
now we have to create a partition so,00:14:21.949,00:14:27.640
"A is 1, B ",00:14:27.640,00:14:31.890
is 4. What is,00:14:31.890,00:14:36.120
"x1? so I'm going to have x1, x2",00:14:36.120,00:14:40.150
x3 and so on ,00:14:40.150,00:14:43.170
so each of these intervals have length 3/n,00:14:43.170,00:14:48.000
3/n,00:14:48.000,00:14:51.690
3/n. So what is the value,00:14:51.690,00:14:56.530
of x1? ,00:14:56.530,00:15:01.630
"it's to the right of 1, the distance is 3/n, so it's one ",00:15:01.630,00:15:06.329
"plus 3/n, right?",00:15:06.329,00:15:10.089
now what's the value of x2? ,00:15:10.089,00:15:14.050
"it's one plus twice that thing, so ",00:15:14.050,00:15:17.160
2*(3/n),00:15:17.160,00:15:20.770
this guy is 1 + ,00:15:20.770,00:15:24.430
3 times 3/n,00:15:24.430,00:15:30.380
So we can see the pattern. The pattern is that x_i,00:15:30.380,00:15:34.990
equals 1+ so for each i ,00:15:34.990,00:15:38.300
I have to step i times. So I have i,00:15:38.339,00:15:42.480
"times delta x, 3",00:15:42.480,00:15:45.850
over n. Questions? ,00:15:45.850,00:15:52.850
so these are the values of x1 x2 x3,00:15:52.959,00:15:56.510
"these are not quite what I need, I need sampling points ",00:15:56.510,00:15:59.560
and this is really my choice. I am going to use the right hand rule ,00:15:59.560,00:16:05.030
use the right,00:16:05.030,00:16:09.550
hand rule. What does it mean? ,00:16:09.550,00:16:13.480
that if I have  an interval xi-1,00:16:13.480,00:16:17.449
"xi, I'm going to take my sampling point",00:16:17.449,00:16:20.560
to coincide with the rightmost border of that interval ,00:16:20.560,00:16:24.790
so xi*,00:16:24.790,00:16:28.060
is going to be equal to xi which is 1 plus ,00:16:28.060,00:16:31.329
plus i3/n,00:16:31.329,00:16:36.180
the last step before I can write down the definition is to evaluate the ,00:16:36.180,00:16:39.930
function,00:16:39.930,00:16:40.620
at this point f(xi*),00:16:40.620,00:16:44.449
so I go here f(xi*) ,00:16:44.449,00:16:48.100
f(xi*) what's my function ,00:16:48.100,00:16:51.610
it's 3-- it's x-3. So I have to take ,00:16:51.610,00:16:55.670
the argument minus 3,00:16:55.670,00:16:59.579
and that's equal to 1+3i,00:16:59.579,00:17:02.980
"over n minus 3, and that's equal to ",00:17:02.980,00:17:06.360
3i/n-2,00:17:06.360,00:17:11.230
okay so I evaluated my function,00:17:11.230,00:17:14.579
at all the sampling points ,00:17:14.579,00:17:19.400
and now I'm ready to use a definition,00:17:19.400,00:17:26.300
please ask me questions at any time,00:17:26.300,00:17:33.300
so we write down from 1 to 4,00:17:38.100,00:17:41.960
(x-3)dx,00:17:41.960,00:17:45.169
this is the integral we're trying to evaluate. This is the limit ,00:17:45.169,00:17:49.640
as n goes to infinity of the Reimann sum,00:17:49.640,00:17:54.960
and under the sum I have ,00:17:54.960,00:17:58.300
"f(xi*), that's the expression I got. 3i/n",00:17:58.300,00:18:01.740
minus 2,00:18:01.740,00:18:06.220
times delta x. That's 3,00:18:06.220,00:18:10.330
"over n. So again, this is f",00:18:10.330,00:18:13.600
f(xi*) and this is ,00:18:13.600,00:18:16.960
delta x,00:18:16.960,00:18:20.210
so now I have concrete numbers in the formulas ,00:18:20.210,00:18:24.110
and I have to evaluate first the sum,00:18:24.110,00:18:28.190
"and then the limit, okay",00:18:28.190,00:18:32.460
so I continue to write limit,00:18:32.460,00:18:36.750
so to evaluate this sum ,00:18:36.750,00:18:40.179
this is a constant. It doesn't depend on i,00:18:40.179,00:18:44.050
so this guy can actually come out here,00:18:44.050,00:18:47.510
so I have 3/n and here I have a sum ,00:18:47.510,00:18:53.179
of 3i/n,00:18:53.179,00:18:56.490
minus 2,00:18:56.490,00:19:00.169
okay. The next step ,00:19:00.169,00:19:06.730
I'm going to split this in to two sums.,00:19:06.730,00:19:13.730
I'm going to have a sum of 3i,00:19:15.120,00:19:19.150
over n minus... like this ,00:19:19.150,00:19:26.150
next I notice that,00:19:26.640,00:19:33.640
"in this sum I have i times a constant, 3/n. So ",00:19:36.840,00:19:41.460
this constant. This constant can come out,00:19:41.460,00:19:48.460
so I have,00:19:50.870,00:19:56.200
3/n,00:19:56.200,00:19:59.530
"the sum of i, and this I can rewrite as 2",00:19:59.530,00:20:05.730
the sum of one ,00:20:05.730,00:20:09.880
questions? So I simplify that,00:20:09.880,00:20:16.880
as much as I could. And now I have ,00:20:19.300,00:20:23.090
"two sums, and both of them we're going to ",00:20:23.090,00:20:26.590
evaluate. The first sum ,00:20:26.590,00:20:29.950
so let's do it here ,00:20:29.950,00:20:33.980
what does this stand for? This stands for ,00:20:33.980,00:20:37.600
"one plus two plus three plus four, and so on",00:20:37.600,00:20:40.830
"all the way to n, that is called an arithmatic progression ",00:20:40.830,00:20:44.370
"and we have a formula for it, right? ",00:20:44.370,00:20:48.040
"you don't have to remember this formula, but you must have seen it ",00:20:48.040,00:20:52.940
before in some class or another. Okay,00:20:52.940,00:20:57.200
"and this one, I want you to tell me what this one is equal to ",00:20:57.200,00:21:04.200
So either one or n. So what do we do here? ,00:21:04.300,00:21:07.600
this is a machine. We have to take it and add it for each i ,00:21:07.600,00:21:11.160
"i goes from 1 to n, so we are going to add this thing together ",00:21:11.160,00:21:15.490
n times. So we'll go 1 +1 +1 +1 +1,00:21:15.490,00:21:19.060
n times. So this is n,00:21:19.060,00:21:23.080
questions? So I evaluated both of these objects. So this ,00:21:23.080,00:21:29.120
n(n+1),00:21:29.120,00:21:32.750
"over 2, this is n ",00:21:32.750,00:21:36.550
so I continue here,00:21:36.550,00:21:40.070
limit as n goes to infinity ,00:21:40.070,00:21:43.540
"I have to collect everything I have here
so 3/n",00:21:43.540,00:21:47.030
3 over,00:21:47.030,00:21:51.030
"n, n(n+1) ",00:21:51.030,00:21:54.290
over 2 minus 2 ,00:21:54.290,00:21:58.050
n. Okay. ,00:21:58.050,00:22:01.430
so something is going to simplify. I am going to ,00:22:01.430,00:22:05.150
divide through by n. One second,00:22:05.150,00:22:12.150
so 3,00:22:20.830,00:22:26.210
"this n cancels, and I'm dividing by n ",00:22:26.210,00:22:29.380
so I have 1+1/n over 2,00:22:29.380,00:22:33.800
minus 2,00:22:33.800,00:22:37.550
"okay, dividing through by n",00:22:37.550,00:22:41.990
all the terms. And now I can take the limit ,00:22:41.990,00:22:45.940
I do this in order to take the limit. The limit is easy ,00:22:45.940,00:22:49.480
because 1/n goes to zero as n becomes large ,00:22:49.480,00:22:52.870
so this is 0,00:22:52.870,00:22:56.200
so I have 3 times 3 halves ,00:22:56.200,00:22:59.940
-2 so this is the answer I get,00:22:59.940,00:23:06.940
and we'll go here. See? ,00:23:09.480,00:23:14.130
"It's the same thing. So you can see two methods, right? This is ",00:23:14.130,00:23:19.750
"done very quickly this is long and
painful",00:23:19.750,00:23:23.130
but we could only do this because these were triangles ,00:23:23.130,00:23:26.720
right? This new definition,00:23:26.720,00:23:30.950
eventually will give us a tool to evaluate the area under  ,00:23:30.950,00:23:34.750
curves. Not just straight lines. Question? ,00:23:34.750,00:23:39.230
student: how did you divide everything by adding it? ,00:23:39.230,00:23:42.620
"So here, let's write this ",00:23:42.620,00:23:45.680
"I have 3, this n cancels",00:23:45.680,00:23:50.150
"so I have 3, and I divide by n ",00:23:50.150,00:23:53.920
here. n+1 over n ,00:23:53.920,00:23:57.700
"2, right? And ",00:23:57.700,00:24:00.840
"n from here, ",00:24:00.840,00:24:04.890
I get this. ,00:24:04.890,00:24:08.540
more questions?,00:24:08.540,00:24:15.540
okay,00:24:17.220,00:24:19.670
very good ,00:24:19.670,00:24:21.770
so ,00:24:21.770,00:24:27.740
it is actually very rare when we can complete this calculation ,00:24:27.740,00:24:32.200
and get the exact numerical answer,00:24:32.200,00:24:36.180
"again, this was possible because it's such  a simple function ",00:24:36.180,00:24:40.640
"so sometimes it make sense to
approximate",00:24:40.640,00:24:43.900
let's not calculate this...the limit ,00:24:43.900,00:24:48.430
but we can get an approximate answer ,00:24:48.430,00:24:51.750
"Okay. So in order to do this, we introduce ",00:24:51.750,00:24:57.210
the midpoint rule,00:24:57.210,00:25:04.210
so simply put ,00:25:10.650,00:25:14.430
"this rule allows me to approximate this
integral",00:25:14.430,00:25:21.370
by a finite sum,00:25:21.370,00:25:25.450
both,00:25:30.090,00:25:33.970
of f of xi bar ,00:25:33.970,00:25:37.280
"delta x, sorry, delta x. ",00:25:37.280,00:25:42.090
What's xi bar? So let's ,00:25:42.090,00:25:45.560
draw one of the intervals ,00:25:45.560,00:25:48.910
from xi-1 to xi. Remember the right point rule ,00:25:48.910,00:25:53.560
"we take our sampling point here. Left point rule, we take it here. ",00:25:53.560,00:25:57.220
"midpoint rule, we use the middle. So ",00:25:57.220,00:26:00.900
so we say that xi*,00:26:00.900,00:26:04.190
simply equals xi bar ,00:26:04.190,00:26:07.460
where it's the middle point. xi bar ,00:26:07.460,00:26:10.750
xi,00:26:10.750,00:26:14.470
okay,00:26:14.470,00:26:17.680
 ,00:26:17.680,00:26:22.110
is it me? no okay,00:26:22.110,00:26:26.490
fine. ,00:26:26.490,00:26:30.210
"So this is the midpoint, and thus the name ",00:26:30.210,00:26:34.230
was a question? okay. ,00:26:34.230,00:26:39.440
was that music? ,00:26:39.440,00:26:42.160
so this is the midpoint and let you,00:26:50.130,00:26:54.320
let me give you an example of how we can apply this rule to approximate ,00:26:54.320,00:26:58.710
a particular integral. So approximate the integral from 0 to 1,00:26:59.600,00:27:08.550
x^2 dx,00:27:08.550,00:27:12.070
with n = 4,00:27:12.070,00:27:15.740
by using,00:27:15.740,00:27:19.140
the midpoint ,00:27:19.140,00:27:24.320
rule. So let's draw ,00:27:24.320,00:27:29.050
every time they ask you to evaluate ,00:27:29.050,00:27:32.400
the Reinmann sum. The best thing to do is to draw your interval ,00:27:32.400,00:27:37.290
 actually right down the partition,00:27:37.290,00:27:41.290
"find the sampling points. Do it systematically, and then it's very easy ",00:27:41.290,00:27:45.190
so we go from 0 to 1,00:27:45.190,00:27:48.540
they specify,00:27:48.540,00:27:51.690
n = 4. So this means that we divide it in to 4,00:27:51.690,00:27:55.370
subintervals. This is 1/2,00:27:55.370,00:27:58.820
"one-quarter, three quarters. Four ",00:27:58.820,00:28:02.020
intervals. Now we have to find the sampling point ,00:28:02.020,00:28:06.100
"Which has to be the middle point, because we are using the midpoint rule ",00:28:06.100,00:28:10.510
"so this one here, x1 bar ",00:28:10.510,00:28:14.530
what is it equal to? 1 over 8,00:28:14.530,00:28:18.850
"okay, x2 bar ",00:28:18.850,00:28:23.160
is 3 over 8,00:28:23.160,00:28:26.600
x3 bar ,00:28:26.600,00:28:30.730
5 over 8,00:28:30.730,00:28:36.250
and x4 bar is 7 over 8,00:28:36.250,00:28:39.570
questions? ,00:28:39.570,00:28:44.420
"So we know our points, just put it here. ",00:28:44.420,00:28:51.420
we have to evaluate the function at these four points. And the function is x^2,00:28:56.960,00:29:00.840
so f(x) ,00:29:00.840,00:29:03.920
is x^2. So ,00:29:03.920,00:29:07.130
f(xi) is just xi^2,00:29:07.130,00:29:10.540
"so we can say that the integral from 0
to 1",00:29:10.540,00:29:15.030
x^2dx is approximately equal to ,00:29:15.030,00:29:18.270
"okay, each term here",00:29:18.270,00:29:21.860
will contain the multiplier delta X,00:29:21.860,00:29:25.010
so I'm going to take it out of the bracket ,00:29:25.010,00:29:29.290
and I forgot to calculate delta x. So ,00:29:29.290,00:29:32.320
what's delta x here? ,00:29:32.320,00:29:35.610
what is the distance between my ,00:29:35.610,00:29:39.920
"points in the partition? One quarter, right? ",00:29:39.920,00:29:43.530
"n=4, the total interval is one, so it's one quarter. ",00:29:43.530,00:29:47.020
so I have one quarter that comes out,00:29:47.020,00:29:50.990
and here I have the sum,00:29:50.990,00:29:54.470
"f1-- oh, f",00:29:54.470,00:29:57.900
"x1, x2",00:29:57.900,00:30:02.970
"x3, ",00:30:02.970,00:30:06.830
x4. So one quarter ,00:30:06.830,00:30:11.070
of one,00:30:11.070,00:30:14.190
"over eight squared, 3 over 8",00:30:14.190,00:30:18.250
"squared, 5 over 8",00:30:18.250,00:30:21.920
"squared, seven over 8",00:30:21.920,00:30:25.390
squared. So if you ,00:30:25.390,00:30:31.270
"put it in your calculators, maybe one of you can do it here, if you have a ",00:30:31.270,00:30:34.390
calculator,00:30:34.390,00:30:35.010
we're going to evaluate this number and see how good ,00:30:35.010,00:30:40.170
this approximation is to this integral ,00:30:40.170,00:30:43.680
what is the exact value of this integral? 1/3.,00:30:43.680,00:30:48.340
"We did it last time, right? So this is going to be ",00:30:48.340,00:30:51.640
something like 0.32,00:30:51.640,00:30:55.320
I believe something like this. So it's not going to be precisely ,00:30:55.320,00:30:58.870
"the exact value, but it's going to approximate it ",00:30:58.870,00:31:03.200
"and if we take a higher n, we will get a better answer",00:31:03.200,00:31:07.330
okay. Questions? Question? ,00:31:07.330,00:31:14.330
"Student: ""the 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, where do they come from?""",00:31:15.150,00:31:19.480
Where do they come from? So these are these values  ,00:31:19.480,00:31:25.110
Okay. These are the sampling points for each interval ,00:31:25.110,00:31:29.270
I have to take the middle point and evaluate my function ,00:31:29.270,00:31:32.780
"at that point so if I use different
color",00:31:32.780,00:31:38.630
inside each interval ,00:31:38.630,00:31:42.620
I calculated the middle ,00:31:42.620,00:31:45.960
of that interval. So my first interval goes from 0 to one quarter ,00:31:45.960,00:31:49.020
"I only have four intervals, this, this, this and this. ",00:31:49.020,00:31:52.250
"for the first interval, the middle corresponds to 1/8",00:31:52.250,00:31:55.780
I have to evaluate my function at that point ,00:31:55.780,00:31:58.800
"the function is x^2, so the function evaluated at that point ",00:31:58.800,00:32:03.540
is 1/8 squared. That's the first ,00:32:03.540,00:32:06.840
term. Then I have to take the second inerval,00:32:06.840,00:32:10.010
"its middle is given by 3/8, the function ",00:32:10.010,00:32:13.110
at that point is given by 3/8 squared,00:32:13.110,00:32:16.780
and so on. I add them up. More questions? ,00:32:16.780,00:32:23.780
So next let's go over some ,00:32:25.890,00:32:29.310
properties of definite integrals ,00:32:29.310,00:32:36.310
so the first property I write down here ,00:33:24.490,00:33:28.430
the integral from ,00:33:28.430,00:33:31.510
a to b f(x),00:33:31.510,00:33:35.440
"dx. The limits of integration, a to b",00:33:35.440,00:33:38.720
can be...can be swapped ,00:33:38.720,00:33:41.880
and we actually can go from b to a ,00:33:41.880,00:33:45.080
"so if a is less than b, we can go this way ",00:33:45.080,00:33:49.320
or we can go the other way ,00:33:49.320,00:33:55.980
but the corresponding integral ,00:33:55.980,00:33:59.370
acquires a negative sign. Why is that? Because when we go,00:33:59.370,00:34:03.880
"in the positive direction, the increment, delta x, ",00:34:03.880,00:34:07.450
"is a positive quantity. When we go back, ",00:34:07.450,00:34:11.140
the value decreases .So the increment is negative. Okay? ,00:34:11.140,00:34:14.760
so if you look at the Reimann sum ,00:34:14.760,00:34:19.169
"you end up multiplying by a negative value, delta x.  ",00:34:19.169,00:34:22.640
so we have a minus sign here. Something that immediately follows from this ,00:34:22.640,00:34:28.270
is the following: the integral,00:34:28.270,00:34:32.350
of f(x)dx from a to a-- what's that equal to?,00:34:32.350,00:34:36.360
0. Two reasons for this: the first reason,00:34:36.360,00:34:40.169
"comes from this formula if I take them
both to be a",00:34:40.169,00:34:43.679
"then this is equal to minus the same thing, so this can only be zero  ",00:34:43.679,00:34:48.330
the other reason,00:34:48.330,00:34:52.320
"is that we're considering a the area
under a curve",00:34:52.320,00:34:55.750
of an infinitely thin ,00:34:55.750,00:34:59.060
"base. So it has to be zero, right? ",00:34:59.060,00:35:03.500
okay,00:35:03.500,00:35:06.540
so then let's list,00:35:06.540,00:35:12.360
a bunch of properties that will help us evaluate,00:35:12.360,00:35:17.270
"very many integrals and Riemann sums, too ",00:35:17.270,00:35:21.920
so property number 1 states,00:35:21.920,00:35:25.640
the integral,00:35:25.640,00:35:28.850
of a constant and it's equal to this ,00:35:28.850,00:35:35.850
so let's suppose that my function,00:35:35.960,00:35:40.470
"is the constant, c",00:35:40.470,00:35:44.800
which can be negative or positive ,00:35:44.800,00:35:48.340
so then this object on the left,00:35:48.340,00:35:52.350
its either the area under this curve,00:35:52.350,00:35:55.890
if this is a positive constant or it's the area above that curve ,00:35:55.890,00:36:00.180
"with a minus sign, so it's the same thing, and this is a rectangle  ",00:36:00.180,00:36:05.440
so the area is equal to b-a,00:36:05.440,00:36:08.950
times C. and that's what we have here ,00:36:08.950,00:36:12.310
on the right hand side. Okay? So it's very easy ,00:36:12.310,00:36:15.960
"to evaluate the definite integral of a
constant because it comes from this",00:36:15.960,00:36:20.210
geometric ,00:36:20.210,00:36:21.020
consideration. Questions? ,00:36:21.020,00:36:26.320
Okay. The next one talks about ,00:36:26.320,00:36:30.910
the integral of a sum ,00:36:30.910,00:36:34.510
"of two functions. So here, both f and g",00:36:34.510,00:36:38.390
"are functions of x. Question? Student: just to make sure, I can't see. Is that an equal sign? ",00:36:38.390,00:36:44.250
here yes. Student: So that only works,00:36:44.250,00:36:47.870
"it works if-- oh, I see. nevermind. It works for both positive ",00:36:47.870,00:36:53.520
and negative values of C and also for C=0,00:36:53.520,00:37:00.520
"So if I have a sum of two functions, then I can evaluate ",00:37:01.700,00:37:06.860
the integral separately. It's fdx,00:37:06.860,00:37:10.220
plus gdx,00:37:10.220,00:37:13.480
gdx. How do I know this? ,00:37:13.480,00:37:20.480
this is very easy to prove ,00:37:20.740,00:37:25.130
all I need to do is recall the definition,00:37:25.130,00:37:32.130
okay,00:37:38.120,00:37:42.840
so this is the definition of the integral f(x) ,00:37:42.840,00:37:46.320
so I can replace f with f+g,00:37:46.320,00:37:51.100
then I'll have f+g here ,00:37:51.100,00:37:55.270
so I can split this sum in to two sums ,00:37:55.270,00:37:58.580
"one was f, the other one was g. Then I can evaluate  ",00:37:58.580,00:38:02.970
the limits separately. The limit for the f sum plus the limit for the g sum,00:38:02.970,00:38:07.410
and that's equal to these two things ,00:38:07.410,00:38:10.750
"Okay? So I'm sorry, I shouldn't forget",00:38:10.750,00:38:13.870
to put the limits of integration. Because what I just wrote actually as a very,00:38:13.870,00:38:20.530
"different meaning. That's the antiderivative, that's not what I'm talking about here ",00:38:20.530,00:38:24.560
Okay. Property number 3: the integral of a constant,00:38:24.560,00:38:29.160
times a function,00:38:29.160,00:38:32.250
is given by the same constant,00:38:32.250,00:38:38.660
times the integral over the function,00:38:38.660,00:38:43.670
Proof? You go here again. If we have c times f here ,00:38:43.670,00:38:48.900
then we have c times f here. c comes out of the sum,00:38:48.900,00:38:52.760
"c comes out of the limit, in order to have a c",00:38:52.760,00:38:56.370
times this which is given,00:38:56.370,00:39:00.690
by the integral times c,00:39:00.690,00:39:06.160
"okay, and finally property number ",00:39:06.160,00:39:09.760
"4 I'm not sure why it's listed as a
separate property in the book",00:39:09.760,00:39:15.970
but i's the integral,00:39:15.970,00:39:19.750
of the difference between two functions ,00:39:19.750,00:39:24.120
it actually follows from properties 2&amp;3,00:39:24.120,00:39:28.400
but I'll write it down nonetheless,00:39:28.400,00:39:33.720
so the integral of a difference is the difference between the two integrals ,00:39:33.720,00:39:40.170
and next we apply all these rules ,00:39:40.170,00:39:43.420
to calculate an example,00:39:43.420,00:39:50.420
so let's look at the integral from 0 to 1,00:40:10.570,00:40:12.970
5+2,00:40:12.970,00:40:16.020
x^2dx,00:40:16.020,00:40:19.310
so one way to approach it will be to,00:40:19.310,00:40:23.200
do it by definition. Write down the limit of a sum,00:40:23.200,00:40:27.280
"of this thing, create a partition ",00:40:27.280,00:40:31.120
calculate sampling points and then do the sums and then the limit ,00:40:31.120,00:40:34.530
"it's very, very tedious. We're going to do the same thing ",00:40:34.530,00:40:38.190
by using the rules so we notice,00:40:38.190,00:40:41.710
that the integrand is a sum of two functions ,00:40:41.710,00:40:45.650
"so by rule number two I'm going to
present it as the sum",00:40:45.650,00:40:51.530
of two integrals. ,00:40:51.530,00:40:58.530
So this is rule number 2. I can,00:41:00.610,00:41:06.080
"evaluated separately. Okay, now ",00:41:06.080,00:41:10.570
"the first one, we have to look at rule number 1",00:41:10.570,00:41:14.320
"which is a constant, right? ",00:41:14.320,00:41:19.520
we have five here so,00:41:19.520,00:41:22.800
we have five,00:41:22.800,00:41:27.800
times 1 minus 0. And that's by rule number one ,00:41:27.800,00:41:31.770
so I dealt with this one nicely. ,00:41:31.770,00:41:35.050
Now this one we have to look at rule number 3.,00:41:35.050,00:41:39.410
"we have a constant inside, 2",00:41:39.410,00:41:43.660
comes out. So we have 2 ,00:41:43.660,00:41:49.800
so this,00:41:49.800,00:41:54.150
is rule number 3. So what's this equal to? ,00:41:54.150,00:41:58.900
I already asked you like five times today. ,00:41:58.900,00:42:02.070
"1/3, right? ",00:42:02.070,00:42:05.550
so we're going to use this fact to write down the answer,00:42:05.550,00:42:08.760
Okay? Very easy. ,00:42:21.160,00:42:25.030
So if we can decompose it somehow,00:42:25.030,00:42:29.000
"and follow different rules, we can ",00:42:29.000,00:42:32.100
evaluate integrals easily. Questions? ,00:42:32.100,00:42:36.640
now rule ,00:42:36.640,00:42:41.670
property number five ,00:42:41.670,00:42:46.080
let's suppose that I have are,00:42:46.080,00:42:49.850
an interval from a to b ,00:42:49.850,00:42:54.290
and I look,00:42:54.290,00:42:57.590
at an integral of fdx--,00:42:57.590,00:43:01.190
"of x dx, and I ",00:43:01.190,00:43:04.780
"define another point, C",00:43:04.780,00:43:08.050
which may or may not be between a and b ,00:43:08.050,00:43:11.550
"actually, it could be anywhere else. Then I can rewrite this integral",00:43:11.550,00:43:17.130
as the sum of the integral from a to c,00:43:18.040,00:43:21.120
plus an integral from c,00:43:21.120,00:43:25.020
to b. ,00:43:25.020,00:43:32.020
I will illustrate this with a picture ,00:43:33.470,00:43:40.470
let's suppose for simplicity that f is positive ,00:43:44.890,00:43:48.840
and the quantity on the left is ,00:43:48.840,00:43:52.190
"has the meaning of the integral under the curve. Question? Student:  ""just want to make sure we're on the same page. C is",00:43:52.190,00:43:56.410
"between a and b?"" It doesn't have to be. So in this example it is  ",00:43:56.410,00:43:59.620
but in general it doesn't have to be. It's just another constant. ,00:43:59.620,00:44:04.580
"So... and you can prove it, of course. Here we illustrated it with an example that ",00:44:04.580,00:44:09.230
is more obvious,00:44:09.230,00:44:09.970
on the left we have the area under this curve. ,00:44:09.970,00:44:14.750
"the whole thing. Now on the right, we have two integrals ",00:44:14.750,00:44:19.890
which is this area and this area,00:44:19.890,00:44:24.800
"you add up the two, and ",00:44:24.800,00:44:28.950
you get the full thing. Okay? So this is the,00:44:28.950,00:44:34.560
"the meaning of this property as an
example for instance we can say that",00:44:34.560,00:44:41.560
we can write this down ,00:44:50.860,00:44:52.890
as the integral from 0 to 1,00:44:52.890,00:44:59.330
1 to five. So this is an example ,00:44:59.330,00:45:05.850
Okay. Question? ,00:45:05.850,00:45:12.850
Student: can you draw an example where c is not between a and b? ,00:45:13.690,00:45:17.240
Yes. So let's consider the following geometry ,00:45:17.240,00:45:21.680
"a, b, c",00:45:21.680,00:45:25.270
so,00:45:25.270,00:45:28.420
we have to assume,00:45:28.420,00:45:31.870
in this case that f is actually defined ,00:45:31.870,00:45:35.640
"for the whole interval. Okay, so if f only exists here, ",00:45:35.640,00:45:39.630
we cannot do this. but if c is in the domain,00:45:39.630,00:45:43.560
"of f, then we can potentially ",00:45:43.560,00:45:46.860
define c to not belong to this interval. ,00:45:46.860,00:45:52.050
"so, so this is my function f",00:45:52.050,00:45:55.630
okay,00:45:55.630,00:46:00.120
so I have an integral from a to b ,00:46:00.120,00:46:03.980
fdx is equal to ,00:46:03.980,00:46:07.660
from a to c fdx,00:46:07.660,00:46:11.450
from c to b dx.,00:46:11.450,00:46:18.450
"Now let's simplify this. So first of all, ",00:46:19.220,00:46:23.840
this first interval ,00:46:23.840,00:46:27.050
I'm going to use this rule and flip the limits ,00:46:27.050,00:46:30.970
so I get,00:46:30.970,00:46:34.090
abfdx,00:46:34.090,00:46:37.340
is minus from c,00:46:37.340,00:46:40.710
to a fdx,00:46:40.710,00:46:45.570
now the second integral spans ,00:46:45.570,00:46:48.770
the interval from c to b. okay? ,00:46:48.770,00:46:52.440
so I'm going to split this one in to this plus this ,00:46:52.440,00:46:55.710
so instead of this integral I'm going to write ,00:46:55.710,00:46:59.230
from c to a fdx,00:46:59.230,00:47:02.740
plus from a to b,00:47:02.740,00:47:06.010
fdx. Right? ,00:47:06.010,00:47:09.360
now you can see that this,00:47:09.360,00:47:12.460
"the first and the second terms cancel
out and I get that identity",00:47:12.460,00:47:18.340
the left hand side is equal to the right hand side ,00:47:18.340,00:47:21.550
"so it's a little bit more... less obvious
but it also works",00:47:21.550,00:47:25.530
more questions? Okay.,00:47:25.530,00:47:30.280
"Finally, the last ",00:47:30.280,00:47:34.010
group of properties is called comparative properties ,00:47:34.010,00:47:38.450
they are,00:47:50.190,00:47:56.580
"numbered from 6 to 8, So let's suppose that f ",00:47:56.580,00:48:01.610
is non-negative,00:48:01.610,00:48:05.640
then the integral from a to b f(x) ,00:48:05.640,00:48:11.630
dx is non-negative. This is obvious,00:48:11.630,00:48:16.060
because for non-negative fs,00:48:16.060,00:48:19.680
"the integral is nothing but the area under the curve, and that's a non-",00:48:19.680,00:48:23.320
quantity. Okay? So we already know this. ,00:48:23.320,00:48:27.290
fine,00:48:27.290,00:48:30.720
"number seven let's suppose that we have
two functions",00:48:30.720,00:48:35.160
and one of them is bigger than the other ,00:48:35.160,00:48:39.590
"on the same, you know ",00:48:39.590,00:48:43.610
interval. Then we can compare ,00:48:43.610,00:48:46.650
the integral of f was the integral ,00:48:46.650,00:48:51.930
of g. The function is bigger ,00:48:51.930,00:48:57.120
and then the integral is bigger too. Let me illustrate this ,00:48:57.120,00:49:01.100
with an example,00:49:01.100,00:49:08.100
Let's suppose that both functions are ,00:49:17.950,00:49:19.970
"non-negative, okay? For simplicity. So this is the larger of the functions, f",00:49:19.970,00:49:26.970
and this is g,00:49:27.739,00:49:32.799
okay? Between a and b,00:49:32.799,00:49:35.849
so the integral of f is this whole area ,00:49:35.849,00:49:40.190
and the integral of g is part of it ,00:49:45.069,00:49:49.190
"right so you can see that the area under
the function g is smaller than the area",00:49:49.190,00:49:53.970
"under the function f, ",00:49:53.970,00:49:54.739
and that's exactly what this says. Okay? ,00:49:54.739,00:49:59.799
"this only works if f is greater than g. If they intersect somewhere, ",00:49:59.799,00:50:05.130
"then we cannot make this conclusion
finally",00:50:05.130,00:50:09.880
the last property,00:50:09.880,00:50:13.980
property 8,00:50:13.980,00:50:17.339
Is like this. Let's suppose that we have two numbers ,00:50:17.339,00:50:20.970
m little and M capital ,00:50:20.970,00:50:27.970
Which work like this. so this is my function from a to b,00:50:28.900,00:50:36.400
"and there's some value, m",00:50:36.400,00:50:40.150
"and another one, M capital ",00:50:40.150,00:50:43.700
such that they enclose this function. One is always smaller ,00:50:43.700,00:50:46.829
"than my function, and the other one is always larger ",00:50:46.829,00:50:49.829
for all values of x on the interval. Okay? Let's suppose I know ,00:50:49.829,00:50:53.759
that these two numbers exist.,00:50:53.759,00:50:57.349
make an estimate of the integral of f,00:50:57.349,00:51:01.450
okay? I know what it's bigger than and I know what it's smaller than ,00:51:01.450,00:51:05.059
what are these things? So the,00:51:05.059,00:51:09.410
integral of f is this area ,00:51:09.410,00:51:12.410
now look at this  box here,00:51:12.410,00:51:16.009
this is completely contained inside,00:51:16.009,00:51:20.819
"this bigger area, and the area of this box ",00:51:20.819,00:51:25.989
is m times b-a. ,00:51:25.989,00:51:32.989
well I can see that the it,00:51:36.049,00:51:40.259
into love F youth gonna the smaller,00:51:40.259,00:51:43.259
done that this box on the other hand,00:51:43.259,00:51:47.190
"but those are the books this on the
aerial the box",00:51:47.190,00:51:54.190
"you buy em capital you minus a in a
completely contains",00:51:55.900,00:51:59.940
then the growth,00:51:59.940,00:52:03.759
"so I can have there's bound the upper
bound on the bill",00:52:03.759,00:52:08.380
"so a I will say this was a an example
and then I let you go",00:52:08.380,00:52:14.140
game,00:52:14.140,00:52:21.140
example like this,00:52:28.180,00:52:32.600
fifth find the %uh,00:52:32.600,00:52:35.910
so the integral,00:52:35.910,00:52:40.450
from 0 to 1/4,00:52:40.450,00:52:43.730
0 he to the Linus affects squared yes,00:52:43.730,00:52:47.860
so at this stage we have no idea,00:52:47.860,00:52:51.170
"what this alias but got but I can read
it down a double in the quality",00:52:51.170,00:52:55.210
that defines what it is so,00:52:55.210,00:52:58.260
"let's blow this function it some taking
functional X",00:52:58.260,00:53:01.340
day because you're a and one a,00:53:01.340,00:53:05.620
when ethical 0 itself is equal to 1,00:53:05.620,00:53:09.810
in 1x chemical 21 it's now the is,00:53:09.810,00:53:15.080
E to the -1 Pratt so for sure,00:53:15.080,00:53:18.870
"I can write down the bowling double
inequality",00:53:18.870,00:53:22.950
he to the -1 is almost,00:53:22.950,00:53:25.970
"less or equal to you to the minus
excluded and thus always less or equal",00:53:25.970,00:53:30.370
to what,00:53:30.370,00:53:30.920
so this function that lot,00:53:30.920,00:53:34.490
"is bounded between if -1 which is
something like one quarter",00:53:34.490,00:53:38.580
and one someone to use proper 28,00:53:38.580,00:53:41.990
to a evaluate,00:53:41.990,00:53:45.520
I the bounds for this and I'll,00:53:45.520,00:53:49.140
on the left I'm gonna have you to the -1,00:53:49.140,00:53:52.450
times 110,00:53:52.450,00:53:55.960
and on the right they have one so,00:53:55.960,00:53:59.830
to conclude well I know,00:53:59.830,00:54:04.360
"that this integral is between one
already",00:54:04.360,00:54:07.440
"and one and this is much more
information",00:54:07.440,00:54:11.460
than I get by just looking at this rate,00:54:11.460,00:54:14.900
thank you much,00:54:14.900,00:54:17.150
