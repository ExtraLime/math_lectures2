"We've already made a few
definitions of operations that",00:00:00.530,00:00:03.900
we can do with vectors.,00:00:03.900,00:00:05.080
"We've defined addition in
the context of vectors",00:00:05.080,00:00:10.620
and you've seen that.,00:00:10.620,00:00:11.460
"If you just have two vectors,
say a1, a2, all the",00:00:11.460,00:00:15.440
way down to a n.,00:00:15.440,00:00:17.330
"We defined the addition of this
vector and let's say some",00:00:17.330,00:00:19.600
"other vector, b1, b2,
all the way down to",00:00:19.600,00:00:23.180
bn as a third vector.,00:00:23.180,00:00:25.300
"If you add these two, we defined
the addition operation",00:00:25.300,00:00:28.390
"to be a third-- you will result
in a third vector where",00:00:28.390,00:00:31.360
"each of its components are
just the sum of the",00:00:31.360,00:00:33.230
"corresponding components of the
two vectors you're adding.",00:00:33.230,00:00:36.020
"So it's going to be a1 plus b1,
a2 plus b2, all the way",00:00:36.020,00:00:41.780
down to a n plus bn.,00:00:41.780,00:00:43.900
"We knew this and we've done
multiple videos where we use",00:00:43.900,00:00:47.170
"this definition of
vector addition.",00:00:47.170,00:00:49.900
"We also know about scalar
multiplication.",00:00:49.900,00:00:52.710
 ,00:00:52.710,00:00:57.455
"Maybe we should just call it
scaling multiplication.",00:00:57.455,00:01:00.107
 ,00:01:00.107,00:01:04.129
"And that's the case of look, if
I have some real number c",00:01:04.129,00:01:07.070
"and I multiply it times some
vector, a1, a2, all the way",00:01:07.070,00:01:11.170
"down to a n, we defined scalar
multiplication of a vector to",00:01:11.170,00:01:15.600
"be-- some scalar times its
vector will result in",00:01:15.600,00:01:18.820
"essentially, this vector were
each of its components are",00:01:18.820,00:01:21.020
multiplied by the scalar.,00:01:21.020,00:01:23.260
"ca1, ca2, all the way
down to c a n.",00:01:23.260,00:01:28.990
"And so after seeing these two
operations, you might be",00:01:28.990,00:01:31.540
"tempted to say, gee, wouldn't
it be nice if there was some",00:01:31.540,00:01:33.950
way to multiply two vectors.,00:01:33.950,00:01:36.440
"This is just a scalar times a
vector, just scaling it up.",00:01:36.440,00:01:39.280
"And that's actually the actual
effect of what it's doing if",00:01:39.280,00:01:41.990
"you visualize it in three
dimensions or less.",00:01:41.990,00:01:45.100
"It's actually scaling the
size of the vector.",00:01:45.100,00:01:47.260
"And we haven't defined size,
very precisely just yet.",00:01:47.260,00:01:50.820
"But you understand at least
this operation.",00:01:50.820,00:01:53.810
"For multiplying vectors or
taking the product, there's",00:01:53.810,00:01:56.440
actually two ways.,00:01:56.440,00:01:57.450
"And I'm going to define one
of them in this video.",00:01:57.450,00:02:00.620
And that's the dot product.,00:02:00.620,00:02:02.000
 ,00:02:02.000,00:02:07.570
"And you signify the dot product
by saying a dot b.",00:02:07.570,00:02:13.750
"So they borrowed one of the
types of multiplication",00:02:13.750,00:02:16.150
"notations that you saw, but you
can't write across here.",00:02:16.150,00:02:18.680
"That'll be actually a different
type of vector",00:02:18.680,00:02:21.390
multiplication.,00:02:21.390,00:02:22.650
"So the dot product is-- it's
almost fun to take because",00:02:22.650,00:02:25.810
"it's mathematically pretty
straightforward, unlike the",00:02:25.810,00:02:28.475
cross product.,00:02:28.475,00:02:29.540
"But it's fun to take and it's
interesting because it",00:02:29.540,00:02:34.040
"results-- so this is a1, a2,
all the way down to a n.",00:02:34.040,00:02:39.860
"That vector dot my b vector: b1,
b2, all the way down to bn",00:02:39.860,00:02:47.550
"is going to be equal to the
product of each of their",00:02:47.550,00:02:51.330
corresponding components.,00:02:51.330,00:02:53.020
"So a1 b1 added together plus a2
b2 plus a3 b3 plus all the",00:02:53.020,00:03:03.780
"way to a n, bn.",00:03:03.780,00:03:06.750
So what is this?,00:03:06.750,00:03:07.370
Is this a vector?,00:03:07.370,00:03:08.640
"Well no, this is
just a number.",00:03:08.640,00:03:09.740
"This is just going to
be a real number.",00:03:09.740,00:03:10.950
"You're just taking the product
and adding together a bunch of",00:03:10.950,00:03:13.580
real numbers.,00:03:13.580,00:03:14.160
"So this is just going to be
a scalar, a real scalar.",00:03:14.160,00:03:17.720
"So this is just going to be
a scalar right there.",00:03:17.720,00:03:20.440
"So in the dot product you
multiply two vectors and you",00:03:20.440,00:03:23.300
end up with a scalar value.,00:03:23.300,00:03:25.890
"Let me show you a couple of
examples just in case this was",00:03:25.890,00:03:28.090
a little bit too abstract.,00:03:28.090,00:03:30.040
"So let's say that we take the
dot product of the vector 2, 5",00:03:30.040,00:03:36.590
"and we're going to dot that
with the vector 7, 1.",00:03:36.590,00:03:40.740
"Well, this is just going to be
equal to 2 times 7 plus 5",00:03:40.740,00:03:45.490
times 1 or 14 plus 6.,00:03:45.490,00:03:48.640
"No, sorry.",00:03:48.640,00:03:49.820
"14 plus 5, which
is equal to 19.",00:03:49.820,00:03:53.980
"So the dot product of this
vector and this vector is 19.",00:03:53.980,00:03:56.980
"Let me do one more example,
although I think this is a",00:03:56.980,00:03:58.790
pretty straightforward idea.,00:03:58.790,00:04:01.200
Let me do it in mauve.,00:04:01.200,00:04:02.920
OK.,00:04:02.920,00:04:03.540
"Say I had the vector 1, 2, 3 and
I'm going to dot that with",00:04:03.540,00:04:08.500
"the vector minus 2, 0, 5.",00:04:08.500,00:04:13.000
"So it's 1 times minus 2 plus
2 times 0 plus 3 times 5.",00:04:13.000,00:04:23.120
"So it's minus 2 plus
0 plus 15.",00:04:23.120,00:04:27.620
"Minus 2 plus 15 is
equal to 13.",00:04:27.620,00:04:30.020
"That's the dot product
by this definition.",00:04:30.020,00:04:33.620
"Now, I'm going to make
another definition.",00:04:33.620,00:04:36.795
"I'm going to define the
length of a vector.",00:04:36.795,00:04:39.100
 ,00:04:39.100,00:04:46.710
"And you might say, Sal,
I know what the length",00:04:46.710,00:04:49.050
of something is.,00:04:49.050,00:04:49.730
"I've been measuring things
since I was a kid.",00:04:49.730,00:04:51.520
"Why do I have to wait until a
college level or hopefully",00:04:51.520,00:04:54.860
"you're taking this before
college maybe.",00:04:54.860,00:04:56.300
"But what is now considered a
college level course to have",00:04:56.300,00:04:59.830
length defined for me.,00:04:59.830,00:05:01.280
"And the answer is because we're
abstracting things to",00:05:01.280,00:05:05.110
"well beyond just R3 or just
three-dimensional space is",00:05:05.110,00:05:09.270
what you're used to.,00:05:09.270,00:05:09.990
"We're abstracting that these
vectors could have 50",00:05:09.990,00:05:12.540
components.,00:05:12.540,00:05:13.110
"And our definition of length
will satisfy, will work, even",00:05:13.110,00:05:17.740
"for these 50 component
vectors.",00:05:17.740,00:05:19.720
"And so my definition of length--
but it's also going",00:05:19.720,00:05:22.240
"to be consistent with what
we know length to be.",00:05:22.240,00:05:25.990
"So if I take the length of a
and the notation we use is",00:05:25.990,00:05:31.240
"just these double lines
around the vector.",00:05:31.240,00:05:35.610
"The length of my vector a is
equal to-- and this is a",00:05:35.610,00:05:38.770
definition.,00:05:38.770,00:05:40.290
"It equals the square root of
each of the terms, each of my",00:05:40.290,00:05:46.150
"components, squared.",00:05:46.150,00:05:47.820
Add it up.,00:05:47.820,00:05:49.020
"Plus a2 squared plus all the
way to plus a n squared.",00:05:49.020,00:05:54.740
"And this is pretty
straightforward.",00:05:54.740,00:05:56.140
"If I wanted to take let's
call this was vector b.",00:05:56.140,00:06:03.240
"If I want to take the magnitude
of vector b right",00:06:03.240,00:06:07.310
"here, this would be what?",00:06:07.310,00:06:08.680
"This would be the square root
of 2 squared plus 5 squared,",00:06:08.680,00:06:14.350
"which is equal to the square
root of-- what is this?",00:06:14.350,00:06:17.200
This is 4 plus 25.,00:06:17.200,00:06:19.460
The square root of 29.,00:06:19.460,00:06:21.820
"So that's the length
of this vector.",00:06:21.820,00:06:24.180
"And you might say look,
I already knew that.",00:06:24.180,00:06:26.210
"That's from the Pythagorean
theroem.",00:06:26.210,00:06:28.010
"If I were to draw my vector
b-- let me draw it.",00:06:28.010,00:06:31.050
Those are my axes.,00:06:31.050,00:06:32.800
"My vector b if I draw
it in standard",00:06:32.800,00:06:34.510
"form, looks like this.",00:06:34.510,00:06:35.510
I go to the right 2.,00:06:35.510,00:06:36.570
"1, 2.",00:06:36.570,00:06:37.580
And I go up 5.,00:06:37.580,00:06:38.600
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5.",00:06:38.600,00:06:41.650
So it looks like this.,00:06:41.650,00:06:43.660
My vector b looks like that.,00:06:43.660,00:06:48.030
"And from the Pythagorean theorem
you know look, if I",00:06:48.030,00:06:50.090
"wanted to figure out the length
of this vector in R2,",00:06:50.090,00:06:53.650
"or if I'm drawing it in kind
of two-dimensional space, I",00:06:53.650,00:06:56.390
"take this side which is length
2, I take that side which is",00:06:56.390,00:06:59.330
"length 5; this is going to be
the square root from the",00:06:59.330,00:07:02.380
"Pythagorean theorem of 2
squared plus 5 squared.",00:07:02.380,00:07:05.650
"Which is exactly what
we did here.",00:07:05.650,00:07:07.340
"So this definition of length is
completely consistent with",00:07:07.340,00:07:11.690
"your idea of measuring things
in one-, two- or",00:07:11.690,00:07:15.310
three-dimensional space.,00:07:15.310,00:07:16.900
"But what's neat about it is that
now we can start thinking",00:07:16.900,00:07:20.580
"about the length of a vector
that maybe has 50 components.",00:07:20.580,00:07:23.950
"Which you know, really to
visualize it in our",00:07:23.950,00:07:26.630
"traditional way,
makes no sense.",00:07:26.630,00:07:28.580
"But we can still apply this
notion of length and start to",00:07:28.580,00:07:31.920
"maybe abstract beyond what
we traditionally",00:07:31.920,00:07:35.010
associate length with.,00:07:35.010,00:07:37.500
"Now, can we somehow relate
length with the dot product?",00:07:37.500,00:07:42.230
"Well what happens if I
dot a with itself?",00:07:42.230,00:07:45.350
What is a dot a?,00:07:45.350,00:07:48.550
"So that's equal to-- I'll
just write it out again.",00:07:48.550,00:07:50.990
"a1, all the way down to a n
dotted with a1 all the way",00:07:50.990,00:07:57.250
down to a n.,00:07:57.250,00:07:59.590
"Well that's equal to a1 times
a1, which is a1 squared.",00:07:59.590,00:08:03.290
Plus a2 times a2.,00:08:03.290,00:08:06.960
a2 squared.,00:08:06.960,00:08:07.970
"Plus all the way down, keep
doing that all the way down to",00:08:07.970,00:08:10.760
"a n times a n, which
is a n squared.",00:08:10.760,00:08:13.990
But what's this?,00:08:13.990,00:08:14.810
"This is the same thing
as the thing you",00:08:14.810,00:08:16.090
see under the radical.,00:08:16.090,00:08:18.220
"These two things
are equivalent.",00:08:18.220,00:08:20.080
"So we could write our definition
of length, of",00:08:20.080,00:08:22.540
"vector length, we can write it
in terms of the dot product,",00:08:22.540,00:08:26.010
of our dot product definition.,00:08:26.010,00:08:27.650
"It equals the square root of the
vector dotted with itself.",00:08:27.650,00:08:32.929
"Or, if we square both sides,
we could say that our new",00:08:32.929,00:08:36.820
"length definition squared is
equal to the dot product of a",00:08:36.820,00:08:45.240
vector with itself.,00:08:45.240,00:08:47.310
"And this is a pretty neat--
it's almost trivial to",00:08:47.310,00:08:50.280
"actually prove it, but this is
a pretty neat outcome and",00:08:50.280,00:08:52.300
"we're going to use this
in future videos.",00:08:52.300,00:08:56.850
"So this is an introduction
to what the dot product",00:08:56.850,00:08:59.720
"is, what length is.",00:08:59.720,00:09:01.360
"In the next video I'm going
to show a bunch of",00:09:01.360,00:09:02.670
properties of it.,00:09:02.670,00:09:03.500
"It will almost be mundane, but
I want to get all those",00:09:03.500,00:09:05.230
"properties out of the
way, so we can use",00:09:05.230,00:09:06.680
them in future proofs.,00:09:06.680,00:09:09.040
 ,00:09:09.040,00:09:09.726
