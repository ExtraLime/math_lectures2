"I'll now introduce you
to the concept",00:00:00.960,00:00:02.980
of the Laplace Transform.,00:00:02.980,00:00:05.460
"And this is truly one of the
most useful concepts that",00:00:05.460,00:00:09.930
"you'll learn, not just in
differential equations, but",00:00:09.930,00:00:13.840
really in mathematics.,00:00:13.840,00:00:15.100
"And especially if you're going
to go into engineering, you'll",00:00:15.100,00:00:18.050
"find that the Laplace Transform,
besides helping you",00:00:18.050,00:00:20.610
"solve differential equations,
also helps you transform",00:00:20.610,00:00:25.480
"functions or waveforms from
the time domain to this",00:00:25.480,00:00:30.210
"frequency domain, and study
and understand a",00:00:30.210,00:00:33.170
whole set of phenomena.,00:00:33.170,00:00:34.740
"But I won't get into
all of that yet.",00:00:34.740,00:00:36.480
"Now I'll just teach
you what it is.",00:00:36.480,00:00:38.920
Laplace Transform.,00:00:38.920,00:00:40.170
"I'll teach you what it is, make
you comfortable with the",00:00:42.960,00:00:45.100
"mathematics of it and then in
a couple of videos from now,",00:00:45.100,00:00:48.330
"I'll actually show you how it
is useful to use it to solve",00:00:48.330,00:00:52.220
differential equations.,00:00:52.220,00:00:53.180
"We'll actually solve some of the
differential equations we",00:00:53.180,00:00:55.200
"did before, using the
previous methods.",00:00:55.200,00:00:56.800
"But we'll keep doing it, and
we'll solve more and more",00:00:56.800,00:00:59.470
difficult problems.,00:00:59.470,00:01:01.000
"So what is the Laplace
Transform?",00:01:01.000,00:01:02.890
"Well, the Laplace Transform,
the notation is the L like",00:01:02.890,00:01:08.575
"Laverne from Laverne
and Shirley.",00:01:08.575,00:01:12.056
"That might be before many
of your times, but",00:01:12.056,00:01:15.040
I grew up on that.,00:01:15.040,00:01:16.860
"Actually, I think it was even
reruns when I was a kid.",00:01:16.860,00:01:20.690
"So Laplace Transform
of some function.",00:01:20.690,00:01:22.770
"And here, the convention,
instead of saying f of x,",00:01:22.770,00:01:25.170
people say f of t.,00:01:25.170,00:01:26.590
"And the reason is because in
a lot of the differential",00:01:26.590,00:01:30.120
"equations or a lot of
engineering you actually are",00:01:30.120,00:01:32.190
"converting from a function
of time to",00:01:32.190,00:01:34.360
a function of frequency.,00:01:34.360,00:01:35.630
"And don't worry about
that right now.",00:01:35.630,00:01:37.300
If it confuses you.,00:01:37.300,00:01:40.180
"But the Laplace Transform
of a function of t.",00:01:40.180,00:01:43.020
"It transforms that function into
some other function of s.",00:01:43.020,00:01:47.820
and And does it do that?,00:01:47.820,00:01:49.410
"Well actually, let me just do
some mathematical notation",00:01:49.410,00:01:53.150
"that probably won't
mean much to you.",00:01:53.150,00:01:56.460
So what does it transform?,00:01:56.460,00:01:57.800
"Well, the way I think of
it is it's kind of",00:01:57.800,00:01:59.630
a function of functions.,00:01:59.630,00:02:00.870
"A function will take you from
one set of-- well, in what",00:02:00.870,00:02:05.220
"we've been dealing with-- one
set of numbers to another set",00:02:05.220,00:02:08.009
of numbers.,00:02:08.009,00:02:09.060
"A transform will take you from
one set of functions to",00:02:09.060,00:02:11.990
another set of functions.,00:02:11.990,00:02:13.100
So let me just define this.,00:02:13.100,00:02:14.140
"The Laplace Transform for our
purposes is defined as the",00:02:14.140,00:02:23.310
improper integral.,00:02:23.310,00:02:24.510
"I know I haven't actually done
improper integrals just yet,",00:02:24.510,00:02:27.790
"but I'll explain them
in a few seconds.",00:02:27.790,00:02:29.890
"The improper integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus",00:02:29.890,00:02:36.430
"st times f of t-- so whatever's
between the Laplace",00:02:36.430,00:02:43.605
Transform brackets-- dt.,00:02:43.605,00:02:49.170
"Now that might seem very
daunting to you and very",00:02:49.170,00:02:51.190
"confusing, but I'll now do
a couple of examples.",00:02:51.190,00:02:54.120
"So what is the Laplace
Transform?",00:02:54.120,00:02:55.660
"Well let's say that f
of t is equal to 1.",00:02:55.660,00:02:57.950
"So what is the Laplace
Transform of 1?",00:02:57.950,00:03:00.300
"So if f of t is equal to 1--
it's just a constant function",00:03:04.180,00:03:07.660
"of time-- well actually, let me
just substitute exactly the",00:03:07.660,00:03:14.280
way I wrote it here.,00:03:14.280,00:03:15.130
"So that's the improper integral
from 0 to infinity of",00:03:15.130,00:03:18.910
"e to the minus st
times 1 here.",00:03:18.910,00:03:24.640
"I don't have to rewrite it here,
but there's a times 1dt.",00:03:24.640,00:03:29.000
"And I know that infinity is
probably bugging you right",00:03:29.000,00:03:32.270
"now, but we'll deal
with that shortly.",00:03:32.270,00:03:34.480
"Actually, let's deal with
that right now.",00:03:34.480,00:03:35.620
"This is the same thing
as the limit.",00:03:35.620,00:03:40.660
"And let's say as A approaches
infinity of the integral from",00:03:40.660,00:03:48.870
0 to Ae to the minus st. dt.,00:03:48.870,00:03:57.400
"Just so you feel a little bit
more comfortable with it, you",00:03:57.400,00:03:59.410
"might have guessed that this
is the same thing.",00:03:59.410,00:04:01.640
"Because obviously you can't
evaluate infinity, but you",00:04:01.640,00:04:04.560
"could take the limit as
something approaches infinity.",00:04:04.560,00:04:07.410
"So anyway, let's take the
anti-derivative and evaluate",00:04:07.410,00:04:09.880
"this improper definite
integral, or",00:04:09.880,00:04:12.730
this improper integral.,00:04:12.730,00:04:13.810
"So what's anti-derivative
of e to the minus st",00:04:13.810,00:04:17.300
with respect to dt?,00:04:17.300,00:04:19.339
"Well it's equal to minus 1/s
e to the minus st, right?",00:04:19.339,00:04:28.625
"If you don't believe me, take
the derivative of this.",00:04:28.625,00:04:30.640
You'd take minus s times that.,00:04:30.640,00:04:32.070
"That would all cancel out, and
you'd just be left with e to",00:04:32.070,00:04:34.500
the minus st. Fair enough.,00:04:34.500,00:04:36.455
"Let me delete this here,
this equal sign.",00:04:39.720,00:04:42.410
"Because I could actually use
some of that real estate.",00:04:42.410,00:04:45.890
"We are going to take the limit
as A approaches infinity.",00:04:45.890,00:04:51.430
"You don't always have to do
this, but this is the first",00:04:51.430,00:04:53.330
"time we're dealing with
improper intergrals.",00:04:53.330,00:04:54.650
"So I figured I might as
well remind you that",00:04:54.650,00:04:57.270
we're taking a limit.,00:04:57.270,00:04:59.340
Now we took the anti-derivative.,00:04:59.340,00:05:01.030
"Now we have to value it at A
minus the anti-derivative",00:05:01.030,00:05:04.960
valued at 0.,00:05:04.960,00:05:06.050
"And then take the limit of
whatever that ends up being as",00:05:06.050,00:05:08.740
A approaches infinity.,00:05:08.740,00:05:09.710
"So this is equal to the limit
as A approaches infinity.",00:05:09.710,00:05:17.490
OK.,00:05:17.490,00:05:17.750
"If we substitute A in here
first, we get minus 1/s.",00:05:17.750,00:05:24.550
"Remember we're, dealing
with t.",00:05:24.550,00:05:26.960
"We took the integral
with respect to t.",00:05:26.960,00:05:30.220
"e to the minus sA, right?",00:05:30.220,00:05:36.630
"That's what happens when
I put A in here.",00:05:36.630,00:05:38.650
"Now what happens when I put
t equals 0 in here?",00:05:41.350,00:05:44.970
"So when t equals 0, it becomes
e to the minus s times 0.",00:05:44.970,00:05:47.830
This whole thing becomes 1.,00:05:47.830,00:05:49.320
"And I'm just left
with minus 1/s.",00:05:49.320,00:05:51.190
Fair enough.,00:05:57.800,00:05:58.450
"And then let me scroll
down a little bit.",00:05:58.450,00:06:01.000
"I wrote a little bit bigger
than I wanted",00:06:01.000,00:06:02.490
"to, but that's OK.",00:06:02.490,00:06:03.770
"So this is going to be the limit
as A approaches infinity",00:06:03.770,00:06:10.160
"of minus 1/s e to the
minus sA minus 1/s.",00:06:10.160,00:06:20.640
So plus 1/s.,00:06:20.640,00:06:24.780
"So what's the limit as A
approaches infinity?",00:06:24.780,00:06:26.170
"Well what's this term
going to do?",00:06:26.170,00:06:28.150
"As A approaches infinity, if
we assume that s is greater",00:06:28.150,00:06:34.350
"than 0-- and we'll make that
assumption for now.",00:06:34.350,00:06:37.810
"Actually, let me write
that down explicitly.",00:06:37.810,00:06:39.000
"Let's assume that s
is greater than 0.",00:06:39.000,00:06:41.950
"So if we assume that s is
greater than 0, then as A",00:06:41.950,00:06:45.320
"approaches infinity, what's
going to happen?",00:06:45.320,00:06:47.870
"Well this term is going to go to
0, right? e to the minus--",00:06:47.870,00:06:53.210
"a googol is a very,
very small number.",00:06:53.210,00:06:55.640
"And an e to the minus googol
is an even smaller number.",00:06:55.640,00:07:00.520
"So then this e to the minus
infinity approaches 0, so this",00:07:00.520,00:07:04.530
term approaches 0.,00:07:04.530,00:07:05.920
"This term isn't affected because
it has no A in it, so",00:07:05.920,00:07:08.850
we're just left with 1/s.,00:07:08.850,00:07:12.420
So there you go.,00:07:12.420,00:07:13.400
"This is a significant to
moment in your life.",00:07:13.400,00:07:16.120
"You have just been exposed to
your first Laplace Transform.",00:07:16.120,00:07:21.190
"I'll show you in a few videos,
there are whole tables of",00:07:21.190,00:07:23.350
"Laplace Transforms, and
eventually we'll",00:07:23.350,00:07:25.300
prove all of them.,00:07:25.300,00:07:27.570
"But for now, we'll just
work through some of",00:07:27.570,00:07:29.440
the more basic ones.,00:07:29.440,00:07:30.230
"But this can be our
first entry in our",00:07:30.230,00:07:32.180
Laplace Transform table.,00:07:32.180,00:07:34.680
"The Laplace Transform of
f of t is equal to",00:07:34.680,00:07:39.870
1 is equal to 1/s.,00:07:39.870,00:07:44.030
"Notice we went from a function
of t-- although obviously this",00:07:44.030,00:07:46.430
"one wasn't really dependent
on t-- to a function of s.",00:07:46.430,00:07:50.460
"I have about 3 minutes left,
but I don't think that's",00:07:50.460,00:07:53.520
"enough time to do another
Laplace Transform.",00:07:53.520,00:07:56.010
"So I will save that for
the next video.",00:07:56.010,00:07:59.040
See you soon.,00:07:59.040,00:08:00.660
