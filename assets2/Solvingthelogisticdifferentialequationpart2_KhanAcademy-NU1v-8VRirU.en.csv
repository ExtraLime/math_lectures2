-(Voice over) So we left off in part one,00:00:00.163,00:00:02.195
getting pretty close to finding our N of T,00:00:02.195,00:00:04.728
"that satisfies the logistic
differential equation",00:00:04.728,00:00:07.825
"where it's initial condition
is between zero and K,",00:00:07.825,00:00:12.276
and now we just have to really just,00:00:12.276,00:00:13.844
do some algebra to finish things up.,00:00:13.844,00:00:16.361
So we left with this.,00:00:16.812,00:00:18.146
For our N of T this must be true.,00:00:18.146,00:00:19.209
"Now, we could use a
little bit of logarithm",00:00:19.776,00:00:22.511
properties to rewrite this left hand side,00:00:22.511,00:00:24.764
as the logarithm of.,00:00:24.764,00:00:27.772
The logarithm of something minus,00:00:28.395,00:00:29.397
"the logarithm of something else,",00:00:29.595,00:00:30.762
"that's going to be the first something,",00:00:30.762,00:00:32.633
The logarithm of the first something,00:00:33.016,00:00:34.034
divided by the second something.,00:00:34.178,00:00:36.977
"One minus N over K,",00:00:37.461,00:00:40.139
and this is of course going to be equal to,00:00:40.188,00:00:42.214
"all this business that we have,",00:00:42.074,00:00:43.587
"is going to be equal to,",00:00:44.253,00:00:45.768
actually let me just write it.,00:00:45.768,00:00:47.115
"It's going to be equal to, equal to,",00:00:47.115,00:00:50.943
"R times T plus C, plus C,",00:00:50.943,00:00:55.943
"and now what we could do,",00:00:57.395,00:00:58.679
this is the same thing as saying that,00:00:58.679,00:01:00.062
E to the R T plus C is going to be,00:01:00.062,00:01:03.619
equal to this thing right over here.,00:01:03.619,00:01:06.263
"This, the natural log of this,",00:01:06.263,00:01:08.479
"is equal to the exponent
that I have to raise",00:01:08.479,00:01:10.527
"E to to get to this right over here,",00:01:10.527,00:01:12.592
so I could just write that.,00:01:13.177,00:01:14.676
"We could just write,",00:01:14.777,00:01:15.844
"or another way of thinking about it,",00:01:15.844,00:01:16.861
"we could take E, if this is equal to that,",00:01:16.861,00:01:19.293
"we could take E to this
power on this left hand side,",00:01:19.293,00:01:21.340
"and E to this power on
this right hand side,",00:01:21.763,00:01:23.781
and they should be equal.,00:01:23.943,00:01:25.294
So E to this power is just going,00:01:25.821,00:01:27.724
to be what's inside the parenthesis.,00:01:27.724,00:01:29.292
It's just going to be N.,00:01:29.292,00:01:31.598
"It's just going to be N over one minus,",00:01:31.598,00:01:35.261
"one minus, N over K.",00:01:35.876,00:01:38.497
"I'll do that in a green color,",00:01:38.088,00:01:39.485
"so you can keep track of
where things came from.",00:01:40.277,00:01:41.372
Is equal to E to this business.,00:01:43.211,00:01:45.222
Is equal to E to the R T.,00:01:45.546,00:01:50.546
"R, I'll do the T in white.",00:01:52.095,00:01:53.978
"R T plus C, plus C.",00:01:54.461,00:01:58.594
Now this I could rewrite if I want to.,00:01:59.249,00:02:02.827
"If I have E to something
plus something else,",00:02:03.062,00:02:05.194
I could rewrite this as to the R T times,00:02:05.194,00:02:08.221
"E times E to the C, and
just to simplify things,",00:02:08.464,00:02:13.464
"this is just going to be
another constant here,",00:02:14.068,00:02:15.899
"and I could, if this is C,",00:02:16.511,00:02:17.526
"I could call it C one,",00:02:17.661,00:02:18.677
"but I'm just going to
call that a constant.",00:02:18.677,00:02:20.561
"So I could just say
that that's going to be",00:02:20.066,00:02:21.834
"equal to some constant times E to the R T,",00:02:22.428,00:02:26.433
and now we just need to solve for N.,00:02:26.928,00:02:29.727
"And once again, at any point while we're",00:02:29.727,00:02:31.103
"working on this you get inspired,",00:02:31.103,00:02:32.927
feel free to solve for N.,00:02:32.927,00:02:34.930
So let's see.,00:02:35.761,00:02:36.562
One way to solve for N.,00:02:36.562,00:02:38.027
Let's see.,00:02:38.027,00:02:38.675
If we could take the reciprocal of both,00:02:38.675,00:02:40.177
"sides of this, we're going to get.",00:02:40.177,00:02:41.644
"Let me draw a line here
just so you know we're.",00:02:42.705,00:02:44.777
Let me draw a line.,00:02:45.577,00:02:47.376
"So, if we take the reciprocal
of both sides of this,",00:02:47.376,00:02:49.927
"we're going to get one over N,",00:02:49.927,00:02:52.223
"one minus N over K over
light green N is equal to,",00:02:52.007,00:02:57.007
"is equal to, and so let's,",00:02:58.454,00:03:00.126
"we could say it's equal to,",00:03:00.126,00:03:02.674
"it's equal to one over C
time E to the negative R T.",00:03:03.262,00:03:06.227
"But one over C, that's just
going to be another constant.",00:03:06.227,00:03:08.728
"So I could write one over C here,",00:03:09.044,00:03:10.129
and I take the reciprocal.,00:03:10.894,00:03:11.827
"And once again, this is just",00:03:11.827,00:03:12.595
"going to be another constant,",00:03:12.595,00:03:13.296
"so I'm going to be a
little bit of hand waving,",00:03:13.296,00:03:15.144
and say well O.K we're going to,00:03:15.144,00:03:16.262
get another constant here.,00:03:16.262,00:03:17.278
"I could have called
this C one, this C two.",00:03:17.278,00:03:20.161
I could call this C three if I want,00:03:20.161,00:03:22.594
to make it clear that these are not,00:03:22.594,00:03:24.012
going to be the same number.,00:03:24.012,00:03:25.561
This is E to the this power.,00:03:25.561,00:03:27.944
This is the reciprocal of that.,00:03:28.328,00:03:30.720
"Actually, maybe I'll do that just to",00:03:30.072,00:03:31.237
make it a little bit clearer.,00:03:31.885,00:03:33.700
"That would have been C
one right over there,",00:03:33.007,00:03:36.284
"and so this is going to be, sorry,",00:03:36.977,00:03:39.178
the reciprocal of this C three,00:03:39.178,00:03:41.126
"and E to the negative,",00:03:41.126,00:03:42.343
"the reciprocal of E to the R
T is E to the negative R T.",00:03:42.343,00:03:44.407
"E to the negative, E to the negative R,",00:03:44.983,00:03:49.983
E to the negative R T.,00:03:51.943,00:03:54.461
"And let's see, if we divide the numerator",00:03:54.677,00:03:56.511
"and the denominator by N,",00:03:56.511,00:03:59.977
or if we divide E.,00:03:59.977,00:04:00.960
"I want to think, if we divide this",00:04:00.096,00:04:01.329
term by in we're going to get.,00:04:02.193,00:04:04.094
"So this term by N is
going to be one over N,",00:04:04.094,00:04:08.172
and then this term by N is just going,00:04:08.311,00:04:09.318
to be minus one over K.,00:04:10.011,00:04:12.062
So this is just going to be minus,00:04:12.086,00:04:13.654
one over K is equal to this.,00:04:14.428,00:04:16.517
This is equal to this business.,00:04:18.952,00:04:21.130
So copy and paste.,00:04:21.130,00:04:23.357
It's going to be equal to that.,00:04:23.711,00:04:25.168
This is good algebra practice here.,00:04:25.521,00:04:27.448
Now let's see.,00:04:27.448,00:04:28.175
"We could take this one over K,",00:04:28.175,00:04:29.477
"add it to both sides, so let's do that.",00:04:29.477,00:04:31.568
"So let me just cut, so
let me cut and paste it.",00:04:32.127,00:04:36.960
"I'm going to add it to both sides,",00:04:36.096,00:04:37.748
so that should be a plus one over K.,00:04:38.612,00:04:40.794
"So, plus one over K.",00:04:41.594,00:04:44.277
"And now to solve for N,",00:04:44.277,00:04:46.144
I just take the reciprocal of both sides.,00:04:46.144,00:04:48.222
"So I'm going to get, I'm going to get N.",00:04:48.561,00:04:51.808
"And I'll write it in kind
of the function notation.",00:04:52.178,00:04:54.344
"N of T, actually let me make my T in white",00:04:54.344,00:04:57.379
since I've been taking the trouble all,00:04:57.694,00:04:58.978
"this time of rewriting this in white,",00:04:58.978,00:05:00.776
is equal to one over.,00:05:00.776,00:05:02.527
"Is going to be equal to one
over all of this business.",00:05:02.527,00:05:07.527
"Is going to be equal to one
over all of this business.",00:05:08.511,00:05:12.926
So copy and paste.,00:05:13.793,00:05:16.577
Is going to be equal to that.,00:05:16.093,00:05:18.691
And that by itself.,00:05:20.011,00:05:21.235
That's by itself is already interesting.,00:05:22.111,00:05:24.530
That by itself is already interesting.,00:05:25.244,00:05:27.710
So I could write it like this.,00:05:28.861,00:05:29.943
"And if I want, if I don't like, let's see,",00:05:30.928,00:05:33.543
"well yeah I could just,",00:05:33.543,00:05:34.910
if I don't like having this K kind,00:05:34.091,00:05:36.143
"of a fraction in a fraction,",00:05:36.962,00:05:37.895
I could rewrite it as.,00:05:37.895,00:05:39.957
"Actually, maybe I'll do it over here.",00:05:41.039,00:05:42.563
"N of, N of T is equal to.",00:05:43.048,00:05:48.048
"I'll just multiply the numerator
and the denominator by.",00:05:49.289,00:05:51.613
"I'll just multiply it,",00:05:51.096,00:05:53.097
"actually let me just leave
it like that for now.",00:05:53.961,00:05:56.694
"And what I'm going do, what
I'm now going to do, is say,",00:05:57.127,00:06:00.478
"""Well look.",00:06:00.478,00:06:01.345
"""We're assuming that N
of zero is N sub knot.""",00:06:01.345,00:06:04.611
"So we're assuming that N of zero,",00:06:04.728,00:06:09.012
"N of zero, is equal to N sub knot.",00:06:09.228,00:06:12.776
So let's write this thing.,00:06:12.776,00:06:14.228
Let's solve for the constant.,00:06:14.228,00:06:15.253
Let's figure out what this could be,00:06:15.478,00:06:17.144
if we know what our initial condition is.,00:06:17.144,00:06:19.362
"So N of zero, N of zero,",00:06:19.677,00:06:23.644
"is going to be equal to,",00:06:23.644,00:06:26.593
"is going to be equal to one, one over.",00:06:27.228,00:06:31.111
"When T is zero,",00:06:31.243,00:06:32.194
"this is just going to be equal to one,",00:06:32.194,00:06:33.978
so it's just going to be our constant C,00:06:33.978,00:06:36.427
three plus one over K plus one over the,00:06:36.427,00:06:41.427
"maximum population that our population,",00:06:41.844,00:06:44.249
"that our environment, can handle,",00:06:44.249,00:06:46.512
"and that's going to be equal to N knot,",00:06:46.512,00:06:49.876
and now we can solve for our constant.,00:06:49.876,00:06:51.710
"So we get, let's see I'm probably going to",00:06:52.056,00:06:53.912
"need a lot of real estate for this,",00:06:53.912,00:06:55.326
"so I can take the reciprocal
of both sides again,",00:06:55.326,00:06:57.561
"so this is something that
we're doing a lot of.",00:06:57.561,00:06:59.889
"C three plus one over K is
equal to one over N knot.",00:07:00.162,00:07:05.162
Is equal to one over N knot.,00:07:06.562,00:07:08.083
"Just took the reciprocal of both sides,",00:07:08.083,00:07:09.894
"and so we get our
constant C three is equal",00:07:09.894,00:07:12.813
to one over N knot minus one over K.,00:07:12.813,00:07:17.813
Minus one over K.,00:07:18.262,00:07:20.661
"So we can rewrite our solution,",00:07:21.062,00:07:23.293
"which we'll call the logistic
function, we get, we get,",00:07:23.293,00:07:27.106
"this is fun now, N of T.",00:07:27.106,00:07:29.877
"N of T is equal to one
over, our constant is this,",00:07:30.793,00:07:35.793
"so it's going to be, let
me copy and paste this.",00:07:38.126,00:07:41.161
So copy and paste.,00:07:42.076,00:07:44.861
"It's going to be that,
that's our constant.",00:07:45.002,00:07:47.379
So it's going to be that times,00:07:48.496,00:07:51.499
"E to the negative R T,",00:07:51.526,00:07:55.127
"to the negative R times T,",00:07:55.711,00:07:59.228
"plus one over K, plus one over K.",00:07:59.228,00:08:04.228
"And if we don't like having
all of these denominators in,",00:08:07.744,00:08:10.428
"all of these fractions in the denominator,",00:08:10.428,00:08:13.144
why don't we multiply everything times the,00:08:13.144,00:08:15.477
numerator and the denominator by N knot K.,00:08:15.477,00:08:18.145
So I'm going to multiply the,00:08:18.145,00:08:19.470
"numerator times N knot K,",00:08:19.047,00:08:22.221
"and I'm going to multiply
the denominator by N knot K.",00:08:22.644,00:08:26.378
N knot K.,00:08:27.669,00:08:28.745
And so what do we get?,00:08:28.745,00:08:29.811
This is all going to be equal to.,00:08:29.811,00:08:31.972
"In the numerator I have N
knot times K, N knot times K.",00:08:32.205,00:08:37.205
"And in the denominator I am going to have,",00:08:38.677,00:08:42.089
let's see if I multiply this term right,00:08:42.089,00:08:43.360
"over here times N knot
K I'm going to have K.",00:08:43.035,00:08:46.738
"If I multiply this term times N knot K,",00:08:48.769,00:08:51.011
"I'm going to have N knot,",00:08:51.811,00:08:53.833
"so it's going to be minus N knot,",00:08:54.293,00:08:56.277
"minus N not, times E to the negative R T,",00:08:57.512,00:09:02.512
"Times E to the negative R T, negative R T,",00:09:03.595,00:09:08.595
"and then if I multiply this times N not K,",00:09:10.635,00:09:13.346
I'm going to get N knot.,00:09:13.346,00:09:15.362
So plus N knot.,00:09:15.431,00:09:18.026
And there you have it.,00:09:18.146,00:09:19.395
We have found a solution for the,00:09:19.395,00:09:21.277
logistic differential equation.,00:09:21.277,00:09:22.894
"We will call this logistic function,",00:09:22.894,00:09:24.789
"and in future videos we
will explore it more,",00:09:24.789,00:09:26.808
and we will see what it actually does.,00:09:26.979,00:09:28.844
"If you were to plot this,",00:09:28.844,00:09:29.820
"and I encourage you to do so,",00:09:29.082,00:09:29.911
"either on the internet,",00:09:30.649,00:09:31.457
"you could try Wolfram Alpha,",00:09:31.457,00:09:31.530
"or if you're on your graphing calculator,",00:09:32.187,00:09:33.468
you will see that it has the exact,00:09:33.468,00:09:36.044
properties that we want it to have.,00:09:36.044,00:09:38.110
It starts at N knot.,00:09:38.011,00:09:39.195
"It starts to increase
at an increasing rate,",00:09:39.294,00:09:40.369
but then it starts to slow down as,00:09:41.044,00:09:42.395
we reach our maximum population.,00:09:42.395,00:09:44.512
"And so that is actually
a very neat function.",00:09:44.512,00:09:46.761
"If you model a population with this,",00:09:46.761,00:09:48.777
you can kind of start to make predictions,00:09:48.777,00:09:50.679
"about what might the
population be at time whatever.",00:09:50.679,00:09:54.261
"And so, hopefully, you
found that satisfying.",00:09:54.261,00:09:57.542
