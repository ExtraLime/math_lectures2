that it was equal to 7.",00:00:03.920,00:00:07.400
"And the way we did it is we
went down this first row.",00:00:07.400,00:00:10.230
"We used the definition I gave
you in the last few where use",00:00:10.230,00:00:12.870
this first row.,00:00:12.870,00:00:13.980
I could even write it here.,00:00:13.980,00:00:15.000

to 1 times the",00:00:15.000,00:00:17.890

"3, 0, 0.",00:00:22.520,00:00:24.440
Minus 2 times the determinant.,00:00:24.440,00:00:26.950
You cross these guys.,00:00:26.950,00:00:28.440
Cross that row and column out.,00:00:28.440,00:00:29.980
"1, 0, 2.",00:00:29.980,00:00:31.310
"1, 0, 2.",00:00:31.310,00:00:32.970
"2, 2, 0.",00:00:32.970,00:00:34.750
"0, 3, 0.",00:00:34.750,00:00:36.770
"And then we went to the plus
the 3 times its sub matrix.",00:00:36.770,00:00:40.180
"I don't have to figure
that out.",00:00:40.180,00:00:41.240
"Just cross out that row
and that column.",00:00:41.240,00:00:43.150
"And then minus 4-- just keep
switching the sign-- times the",00:00:43.150,00:00:47.950
determinant of its sub matrix.,00:00:47.950,00:00:49.570
"So this one had a bunch of
terms. And this one's going to",00:00:49.570,00:00:51.410
"have a bunch of terms. Cross
that row and that column out.",00:00:51.410,00:00:53.710

"2, 3, 0.",00:00:55.930,00:00:57.000
I'll just write it here.,00:00:57.000,00:00:57.710
"1, 0, 2.",00:00:57.710,00:00:59.600

"2, 3, 0.",00:01:01.130,00:01:02.770
"And that is a completely
legitimate way to figure out a",00:01:02.770,00:01:05.610
determinant.,00:01:05.610,00:01:06.110
"And that was our definition for
how to find a determinant.",00:01:06.110,00:01:08.600
"But I want to show you in this
video that there's more than",00:01:08.600,00:01:10.890
"one way to solve for
determinant.",00:01:10.890,00:01:12.970
"What I'm going to show you this
way is the same thing",00:01:12.970,00:01:14.550
"that we did down
this first row.",00:01:14.550,00:01:16.560
"We can actually do down any
row or any column of this",00:01:16.560,00:01:20.000
"determinant, or of
this matrix.",00:01:20.000,00:01:22.610
"And the reason why that's useful
is because we can pick",00:01:22.610,00:01:25.010
"rows or columns that
have a unusually",00:01:25.010,00:01:28.040
large number of zeros.,00:01:28.040,00:01:29.490
"Because that tends to simplify
our computations.",00:01:29.490,00:01:32.350
"So the first thing that you have
to do before you embark",00:01:32.350,00:01:35.100
"on picking an arbitrary row or
a column, let's say, for",00:01:35.100,00:01:38.070
"example, we want to pick this.",00:01:38.070,00:01:40.320
"Let's do one row and one
column in this example.",00:01:40.320,00:01:42.390
"So let's say we want to go down
that row instead because",00:01:42.390,00:01:44.580
"we like the fact that has
a lot of zeros there.",00:01:44.580,00:01:47.150
"The first thing you have to do
is remember the pattern.",00:01:47.150,00:01:49.620
"Remember, you switch signs
on the coefficients.",00:01:49.620,00:01:52.210
"You don't just switch signs
as you go down a row.",00:01:52.210,00:01:54.350
"You also switch signs as
you go down a column.",00:01:54.350,00:01:56.930
"So the general pattern for 4
by 4 will look like this.",00:01:56.930,00:02:00.710
"It'll be plus, minus,
plus, minus, minus,",00:02:00.710,00:02:05.450
"plus, minus, plus.",00:02:05.450,00:02:08.380
"And then you get a plus, minus,
minus, plus, plus,",00:02:08.380,00:02:12.090
"minus, minus, plus.",00:02:12.090,00:02:13.950
"It's really this checker
board pattern.",00:02:13.950,00:02:15.870
"If you wanted to figure out
the sign for any ij.",00:02:15.870,00:02:20.200
"So let's say you wanted
to figure out the sign",00:02:20.200,00:02:22.020
"for, this is 2, 2.",00:02:22.020,00:02:24.170
"So if you want to find
the sign-- let me",00:02:24.170,00:02:27.360
write it this way.,00:02:27.360,00:02:28.370
"Say we have a function, let
me define a function.",00:02:28.370,00:02:31.670
"I think the checker board
pattern's pretty clear to you,",00:02:31.670,00:02:33.570
but I'll just write it down.,00:02:33.570,00:02:34.470
"Let's say I wanted to figure
out the sign-- the sign not",00:02:34.470,00:02:38.760
the trig ratio.,00:02:38.760,00:02:42.280
"I want to figure out the sign of
any entry where you give me",00:02:42.280,00:02:46.820
an i and a j.,00:02:46.820,00:02:48.440
"What you could do is you
just take negative 1 to",00:02:48.440,00:02:50.620
the i plus j power.,00:02:50.620,00:02:53.070
"So if you wanted to figure out
the sign for the, let's say,",00:02:53.070,00:02:57.190
"you are in row 4, column 2.",00:02:57.190,00:03:01.720
"Row 4, column 2.",00:03:01.720,00:03:04.040
So what will it be?,00:03:04.040,00:03:04.890
Do 4 plus 2.,00:03:04.890,00:03:07.550
"Negative 1 to the sixth
power is equal to 1.",00:03:07.550,00:03:09.990
"That's going to be
a positive 1.",00:03:09.990,00:03:12.850
"Let's say you want
to take this guy.",00:03:16.650,00:03:17.840
So this is i is equal to 2.,00:03:17.840,00:03:22.860
j is equal to 3.,00:03:22.860,00:03:24.350
"We're in the second
row, third column.",00:03:24.350,00:03:26.580
2 plus 3 is 5.,00:03:26.580,00:03:28.150
"Minus 1 to the fifth
power is minus 1.",00:03:28.150,00:03:31.160
And you have a minus there.,00:03:31.160,00:03:32.280
"So that's another way
to think about it.",00:03:32.280,00:03:34.290
"But the checker board
pattern's pretty",00:03:34.290,00:03:35.640
straightforward.,00:03:35.640,00:03:36.650
"So now that you have the checker
board pattern in your",00:03:36.650,00:03:38.530
"mind, let's go down this row.",00:03:38.530,00:03:40.860
Let's go down this row.,00:03:40.860,00:03:42.770
So we start with the 2.,00:03:42.770,00:03:44.260
"But notice that we have
to multiply by minus.",00:03:44.260,00:03:46.630
"Because we go plus, minus,
plus, minus.",00:03:46.630,00:03:50.090
So you have a minus 2 times the,00:03:50.090,00:03:52.610
determinant of its sub matrix.,00:03:52.610,00:03:54.480
"So you cross out this
row and that column.",00:03:54.480,00:03:56.350
"And you're left with this
matrix up here.",00:03:56.350,00:03:58.530
"So it's 2, 3, 4.",00:03:58.530,00:04:01.490
"0, 2, 0.",00:04:01.490,00:04:04.050
"1, 2, 3.",00:04:04.050,00:04:07.650
"This is a minus and then
you have a plus.",00:04:07.650,00:04:09.960
"So you have a plus 3 times--
get rid of this",00:04:09.960,00:04:13.880
guy's column and row.,00:04:13.880,00:04:15.370
"And you have 1, 1, 0.",00:04:15.370,00:04:16.750
"1, 1, 0.",00:04:16.750,00:04:18.190
That's that right there.,00:04:18.190,00:04:19.360
"3, 2, 2.",00:04:19.360,00:04:20.970
"3, 2, 2.",00:04:20.970,00:04:22.850
"And you have 4, 0, 3.",00:04:22.850,00:04:24.940
"4, 0, 3.",00:04:24.940,00:04:27.020
"And then you would have a
minus a 0 times its sub",00:04:27.020,00:04:29.630
matrix plus a 0.,00:04:29.630,00:04:30.900
"But we can ignore those
because 0 times",00:04:30.900,00:04:32.560
anything is a 0.,00:04:32.560,00:04:33.910
"So already we've simplified our
determinant a good bit.",00:04:33.910,00:04:38.230
"So let's see if we can
evaluate this and",00:04:38.230,00:04:39.950
get the same number.,00:04:39.950,00:04:41.170
"Because only then will it be
reasonably satisfying.",00:04:41.170,00:04:43.810
"So what's the determinant
of this guy?",00:04:43.810,00:04:45.410
"Well we can do the exact
same principle.",00:04:45.410,00:04:47.360
"We can go down any row or
column that seems to be",00:04:47.360,00:04:49.810
especially simple.,00:04:49.810,00:04:51.240
So let's go down that row.,00:04:51.240,00:04:54.370
"Because that row seems
especially simple.",00:04:54.370,00:04:56.230
"So this is going
to be minus 2.",00:04:56.230,00:04:58.470
"That's this minus 2 right
here times the",00:04:58.470,00:05:01.010
determinant of this guy.,00:05:01.010,00:05:02.330
"So the determinant of this guy,
we just have to go and",00:05:02.330,00:05:05.220
"say OK we have a plus,
we have a minus, and",00:05:05.220,00:05:08.120
then we have a plus.,00:05:08.120,00:05:08.720
"It's going to be minus 0 times
its sub determinant, I guess",00:05:08.720,00:05:13.192
we would call it.,00:05:13.192,00:05:13.740
"Get rid of that row or that
column and that row.",00:05:13.740,00:05:17.240
"So it'd be minus 0 times
anything, that's just going to",00:05:17.240,00:05:18.910
be 0 plus 2.,00:05:18.910,00:05:20.850
"So plus 2 times the
determinant.",00:05:20.850,00:05:24.560
"Get rid of its row
and its columns.",00:05:24.560,00:05:26.610
"2, 4, 1, 2.",00:05:26.610,00:05:28.140
"2, 4, 1, 3.",00:05:28.140,00:05:32.280
"And then you have a minus
0 times this thing.",00:05:32.280,00:05:34.830
"But who cares what that is
because you have a 0 times.",00:05:34.830,00:05:37.500
"So that just simplified
to that which is nice.",00:05:37.500,00:05:40.630
Let me write it like that.,00:05:40.630,00:05:43.000
"And then you have plus 3 times
this thing right here.",00:05:43.000,00:05:49.940
"We don't want to do
the first row.",00:05:49.940,00:05:50.950
We have no non 0 terms here.,00:05:50.950,00:05:52.520
"Let's at least do this
row right here for a",00:05:52.520,00:05:55.910
little bit of variety.,00:05:55.910,00:05:58.130
"None of the columns actually
seem that interesting.",00:05:58.130,00:06:00.300
"They all have, at most, one 0.",00:06:00.300,00:06:03.010
"So if we do that one right here,
this is a plus, minus,",00:06:03.010,00:06:06.730
"plus, minus, plus.",00:06:06.730,00:06:09.270
"So we'll have a plus
0 times 3, 4, 2, 0.",00:06:09.270,00:06:12.300
We can ignore that.,00:06:12.300,00:06:13.420
Minus 2 times the determinant.,00:06:13.420,00:06:15.900
"Get rid of this column,
that row.",00:06:15.900,00:06:19.410
I have to be very careful.,00:06:19.410,00:06:20.420
"I put this minus there, but
there wasn't a minus 1 there.",00:06:20.420,00:06:23.880
"Let me write it like-- I want to
make sure I don't make any",00:06:23.880,00:06:29.240
careless errors right here.,00:06:29.240,00:06:30.490
This is a plus 1.,00:06:30.490,00:06:31.970
"I just drew a minus 1 there
to show you how",00:06:31.970,00:06:34.070
things switch signs.,00:06:34.070,00:06:35.530
"So this is going to
be a 3 times.",00:06:35.530,00:06:40.070
"So we're going to go down--
This is this 3 right here.",00:06:40.070,00:06:43.060
"I lost my bearings with
that minus there.",00:06:43.060,00:06:45.090
"We're trying to find the
determinant of this.",00:06:45.090,00:06:46.950
So it's 0 times this matrix.,00:06:46.950,00:06:49.340
We can ignore that.,00:06:49.340,00:06:50.650
Minus 2 times its sub matrix.,00:06:50.650,00:06:53.320
Which is that and that.,00:06:53.320,00:06:55.330
"So it's 1, 1, 4, 0.",00:06:55.330,00:06:59.320
"And then you have a plus
3 times its sub matrix.",00:06:59.320,00:07:02.240
"1, 3, 1, 2.",00:07:02.240,00:07:03.630
"1, 3, 1, 2.",00:07:03.630,00:07:06.070
Just like that.,00:07:06.070,00:07:08.020
"Let's see if we can
simplify this.",00:07:08.020,00:07:10.130
"2 times 3 is 6 minus
1 times 4.",00:07:10.130,00:07:14.040
"So, this becomes 6 minus 4.",00:07:14.040,00:07:16.220
So that's 2.,00:07:16.220,00:07:17.350
"So this whole thing simplifies
to 2 times 2 which is 4.",00:07:17.350,00:07:20.780
4 times minus 2.,00:07:20.780,00:07:22.100
"The whole thing simplifies
to minus 8.",00:07:22.100,00:07:26.470
"Now, this guy right here, we
have 1 times 0, which is 0,",00:07:26.470,00:07:31.230
minus 1 times 4.,00:07:31.230,00:07:32.730
This is minus 4 times minus 2.,00:07:32.730,00:07:35.610
"This whole thing becomes
a positive 8.",00:07:35.610,00:07:37.870
"You have 1 times 2, which
is 2, minus 1 times 3.",00:07:37.870,00:07:41.840
Which is minus 3.,00:07:41.840,00:07:44.260
So you get a minus 1.,00:07:44.260,00:07:45.140
"So this becomes a minus--
I mean you get 2 minus 3",00:07:45.140,00:07:49.220
minus 1 times 3.,00:07:49.220,00:07:50.450
So this becomes a minus 3.,00:07:50.450,00:07:52.960
So you have an 8 minus a 3.,00:07:52.960,00:07:55.220
So this becomes a minus five.,00:07:55.220,00:07:57.333
"You have a 3 times a minus
5 right there.",00:08:01.930,00:08:05.050
"So 3 times minus 5 is going
to be equal to minus 15.",00:08:05.050,00:08:12.700
"Let me make sure I got-- oh
I made a silly mistake.",00:08:12.700,00:08:16.530
"If you have an 8 minus a 3, this
is 8, this is minus, this",00:08:16.530,00:08:19.730
is going to be 5.,00:08:19.730,00:08:21.340
Very easy.,00:08:21.340,00:08:21.900
"Your brain starts to get fried
if you do this long enough.",00:08:21.900,00:08:24.760
"And the you have a 3 times
a 5 and you get a 15.",00:08:24.760,00:08:27.510
You get a 15.,00:08:27.510,00:08:28.650
And then you have a 15.,00:08:28.650,00:08:30.030
"This term plus this term is 15
minus 8 which is equal to 7.",00:08:30.030,00:08:35.169
"Which, lucky for us, I barely
evaded making a careless",00:08:35.169,00:08:39.500
"mistake there, we got
the right answer.",00:08:39.500,00:08:41.250
"But this is a much simpler
computation than we did in the",00:08:41.250,00:08:44.190
last video.,00:08:44.190,00:08:45.140
"And it was much simpler because
we picked the row that",00:08:45.140,00:08:48.450
"happened to have a lot
of zeros on it.",00:08:48.450,00:08:50.880
"So we only had two of these
terms instead of four terms",00:08:50.880,00:08:53.590
like we had in the last video.,00:08:53.590,00:08:55.170
"And you could do the same, you
could pick columns that have a",00:08:55.170,00:08:57.770
lot of zeros.,00:08:57.770,00:08:58.590

that you always use this",00:08:58.590,00:09:01.020
