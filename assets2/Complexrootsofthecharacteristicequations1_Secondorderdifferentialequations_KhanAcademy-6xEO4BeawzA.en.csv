"We learned in the last several
videos, that if I had a linear",00:00:00.820,00:00:04.570
"differential equation with
constant coefficients in a",00:00:04.570,00:00:07.400
"homogeneous one, that had the
form A times the second",00:00:07.400,00:00:12.570
"derivative plus B times the
first derivative plus C",00:00:12.570,00:00:18.520
"times-- you could say the
function, or the 0",00:00:18.520,00:00:20.750
derivative-- equal to 0.,00:00:20.750,00:00:22.910
"If that's our differential
equation that the",00:00:22.910,00:00:24.240
"characteristic equation of that
is Ar squared plus Br",00:00:24.240,00:00:33.380
plus C is equal to 0.,00:00:33.380,00:00:36.910
"And if the roots of this
characteristic equation are",00:00:36.910,00:00:38.930
"real-- let's say we have
two real roots.",00:00:38.930,00:00:40.550
Let me write that down.,00:00:40.550,00:00:41.540
"So the real scenario where the
two solutions are going to be",00:00:41.540,00:00:46.710
"r1 and r2, where these
are real numbers.",00:00:46.710,00:00:50.450
"Then the general solution of
this differential equation--",00:00:50.450,00:00:53.710
"and watch the previous videos if
you don't remember this or",00:00:53.710,00:00:56.730
"if you don't feel like it's
suitably proven to you-- the",00:00:56.730,00:01:01.100
"general solution is y is equal
to some constant times e to",00:01:01.100,00:01:05.650
"the first root x plus some other
constant times e to the",00:01:05.650,00:01:12.570
second root times x.,00:01:12.570,00:01:14.620
"And we did that in the
last several videos.",00:01:14.620,00:01:16.570
We even did some examples.,00:01:16.570,00:01:19.200
"Now my question to you is, what
if the characteristic",00:01:19.200,00:01:21.840
"equation does not
have real roots,",00:01:21.840,00:01:24.110
what if they are complex?,00:01:24.110,00:01:25.980
"And just a little bit
of review, what",00:01:25.980,00:01:27.090
do I mean by that?,00:01:27.090,00:01:27.980
"Well, if I wanted to figure out
the roots of this and if I",00:01:27.980,00:01:31.380
"was lazy, and I just want to do
it without having to think,",00:01:31.380,00:01:34.130
"can I factor it, I would just
immediately use the quadratic",00:01:34.130,00:01:36.640
"equation, because that
always works.",00:01:36.640,00:01:38.050
"I would say, well the roots of
my characteristic equation are",00:01:38.050,00:01:45.140
"negative B plus or minus
the square root of B",00:01:45.140,00:01:53.770
squared minus 4AC.,00:01:53.770,00:01:56.195
All of that over 2A.,00:02:00.850,00:02:05.820
"So what do I mean by
non-real roots?",00:02:05.820,00:02:08.090
"Well, if this expression right
here-- if this B squared minus",00:02:08.090,00:02:11.460
"4AC-- if that's a negative
number, then I'm going to have",00:02:11.460,00:02:14.300
"to take the square root
of a negative number.",00:02:14.300,00:02:16.340
"So it will actually be an
imaginary number, and so this",00:02:16.340,00:02:20.140
"whole term will actually
become complex.",00:02:20.140,00:02:22.450
"We'll have a real part and
an imaginary part.",00:02:22.450,00:02:24.930
"And actually, the two roots are
going to be conjugates of",00:02:24.930,00:02:28.270
"each other, right?",00:02:28.270,00:02:29.070
"We could rewrite this in the
real and imaginary parts.",00:02:29.070,00:02:31.260
"We could rewrite this as the
roots are going to be equal to",00:02:31.260,00:02:34.350
"minus B over 2A, plus or minus
the square root of B squared",00:02:34.350,00:02:44.490
minus 4AC over 2A.,00:02:44.490,00:02:50.360
"And if B squared minus 4AC is
less than 0, this is going to",00:02:50.360,00:02:53.410
be an imaginary number.,00:02:53.410,00:02:55.670
"So in that case, let's just
think about what the roots",00:02:55.670,00:02:59.190
"look like generally and then
we'll actually do some",00:02:59.190,00:03:00.980
"problems. So let me
go back up here.",00:03:00.980,00:03:03.770
"So then the roots aren't
going to be two real",00:03:03.770,00:03:05.810
numbers like that.,00:03:05.810,00:03:06.610
"The roots, we can write them
as two complex numbers that",00:03:06.610,00:03:09.670
are conjugates of each other.,00:03:09.670,00:03:10.790
"And I think light blue is a
suitable color for that.",00:03:10.790,00:03:13.610
"So in that situation, let me
write this, the complex",00:03:13.610,00:03:17.870
"roots-- this is a complex roots
scenario-- then the",00:03:17.870,00:03:23.710
"roots of the characteristic
equation are going to be, I",00:03:23.710,00:03:27.385
"don't know, some number--
Let's call it lambda.",00:03:27.385,00:03:31.710
"Let's call it mu, I think that's
the convention that",00:03:31.710,00:03:34.250
"people use-- actually let me see
what they tend to use, it",00:03:34.250,00:03:37.300
"really doesn't matter--
let's say it's lambda.",00:03:37.300,00:03:42.460
"So this number, some constant
called lambda, and then plus",00:03:42.460,00:03:46.830
"or minus some imaginary
number.",00:03:46.830,00:03:51.830
"And so it's going to be
some constant mu.",00:03:51.830,00:03:55.640
"That's just some constant, I'm
not trying to be fancy, but",00:03:55.640,00:03:57.900
"this is I think the convention
used in most differential",00:03:57.900,00:04:01.150
equations books.,00:04:01.150,00:04:02.100
So it's mu times i.,00:04:02.100,00:04:05.390
"So these are the two
roots, and these",00:04:05.390,00:04:07.860
"are true roots, right?",00:04:07.860,00:04:08.720
"Because we have lambda plus mu
i, and lambda minus mu i.",00:04:08.720,00:04:12.440
"So these would be the two roots,
if B squared minus 4AC",00:04:12.440,00:04:17.130
is less than 0.,00:04:17.130,00:04:18.970
"So let's see what happens when
we take these two roots and we",00:04:18.970,00:04:23.100
"put them into our general
solution.",00:04:23.100,00:04:25.630
"So just like we've learned
before, the general solution",00:04:25.630,00:04:29.760
"is going to be-- I'll stay in
the light blue-- the general",00:04:29.760,00:04:33.460
"solution is going to be y is
equal to c1 times e to the",00:04:33.460,00:04:39.380
"first root-- let's make that
the plus version-- so",00:04:39.380,00:04:42.220
lambda plus mu i.,00:04:42.220,00:04:49.770
"All of that times x, plus c2
times e to the second root.",00:04:49.770,00:04:58.920
"So that's going to be lambda
minus mu i times x.",00:04:58.920,00:05:06.890
"Let's see if we can do some
simplification here, because",00:05:06.890,00:05:09.220
"that i there really kind of
makes things kind of crazy.",00:05:09.220,00:05:12.900
"So let's see if we can do
anything to either get rid of",00:05:12.900,00:05:14.600
"it or simplify it, et cetera.",00:05:14.600,00:05:16.460
So let's multiply the x out.,00:05:16.460,00:05:20.080
"Just doing some algebraic
manipulation.",00:05:20.080,00:05:21.940
"I'm trying to use as much
space as possible.",00:05:21.940,00:05:23.780
"So we get y is equal to
c1 e to the what?",00:05:23.780,00:05:30.730
"Lambda x-- just distributing
that x-- plus mu xi, plus c2",00:05:30.730,00:05:41.450
"times e to the lambda
x minus mu xi.",00:05:41.450,00:05:50.230
"Just distributed the x's
in both of the terms.",00:05:50.230,00:05:53.960
And let's see what we can do.,00:05:53.960,00:05:55.770
"Well, when you add exponents,
this is the exact same thing",00:05:55.770,00:06:00.550
"as y is equal to c1 e to
the lambda x, times e",00:06:00.550,00:06:12.020
"to the mu xi, right?",00:06:12.020,00:06:16.490
"If you have the same base and
you're multiplying, you could",00:06:16.490,00:06:18.300
"just add exponents, so this
is the same thing as that.",00:06:18.300,00:06:20.750
"Plus c2 times e to the lambda x,
times e to the minus mu xi.",00:06:20.750,00:06:33.173
"Now let's see, we have an e to
the lambda x in both of these",00:06:33.173,00:06:36.390
"terms, so we can
factor it out.",00:06:36.390,00:06:38.150
"So we get y is equal to-- let
me draw a line here, I don't",00:06:38.150,00:06:43.380
"want you to get confused with
all this quadratic equation",00:06:43.380,00:06:45.280
"stuff-- y is equal to e to the
lambda x times c1 e to the mu",00:06:45.280,00:07:00.610
"xi-- that's an i-- plus c2 times
e to the minus mu xi.",00:07:00.610,00:07:11.430
Now what we can we do?,00:07:11.430,00:07:13.540
And this is where it gets fun.,00:07:13.540,00:07:15.240
"If you watched the calculus
playlist, especially when I",00:07:15.240,00:07:18.090
"talk about approximating
functions with series, we came",00:07:18.090,00:07:22.160
"up with what I thought was the
most amazing result in",00:07:22.160,00:07:25.260
"calculus, just from a-- or in
mathematics-- just from a",00:07:25.260,00:07:28.070
metaphysical point of view.,00:07:28.070,00:07:30.040
"And now we will actually use it
for something that you'll",00:07:30.040,00:07:33.180
"hopefully see is
vaguely useful.",00:07:33.180,00:07:35.680
"So here we have two terms that
have something times e to the",00:07:35.680,00:07:41.490
something times i.,00:07:41.490,00:07:42.960
"And we learned before,
Euler's formula.",00:07:42.960,00:07:46.410
And what was Euler's formula?,00:07:46.410,00:07:47.340
I'll write that in purple.,00:07:47.340,00:07:50.160
"That e to the i theta, or we
could write e to the ix, is",00:07:50.160,00:07:58.110
"equal to cosine of x
plus i sine of x.",00:07:58.110,00:08:06.070
"And what's amazing about that
is, if you put negative 1 in",00:08:06.070,00:08:08.610
"here, then you get e to the-- oh
no, actually if you put pi",00:08:08.610,00:08:15.120
"in here-- so e to the i pi is
equal to negative 1, right?",00:08:15.120,00:08:20.210
"If you substituted this because
sine of pi is 0.",00:08:20.210,00:08:22.070
"So I thought that was amazing,
where you could write e to the",00:08:22.070,00:08:25.700
i 2 pi is equal to 1.,00:08:25.700,00:08:29.000
That's pretty amazing as well.,00:08:29.000,00:08:30.660
"And in one equation you have all
of the fundamental numbers",00:08:30.660,00:08:34.750
of mathematics.,00:08:34.750,00:08:35.700
"That's amazing, but let's
get back down to",00:08:35.700,00:08:38.059
earth and get practical.,00:08:38.059,00:08:39.080
"So let's see if we can use this
to simplify Euler's--",00:08:39.080,00:08:43.010
"This is actually a definition,
and the definition makes a lot",00:08:43.010,00:08:46.570
"of sense, because when you
do the power series",00:08:46.570,00:08:49.680
"approximation, or the
Maclaurin series",00:08:49.680,00:08:51.410
"approximation, of e to the x, it
really looks like cosine of",00:08:51.410,00:09:01.150
"x plus i times the power series
approximation of x.",00:09:01.150,00:09:05.970
"But anyway, we won't
go into that now.",00:09:05.970,00:09:07.470
"I have like six or seven
videos on it.",00:09:07.470,00:09:09.360
"But let's use this to simplify
this up here.",00:09:09.360,00:09:12.110
"So we can rewrite that as y is
equal to e to the lambda x",00:09:12.110,00:09:22.640
"times-- let's do the
first one-- c1.",00:09:22.640,00:09:25.990
"It's e to the mu xi,
so instead of an x",00:09:25.990,00:09:31.285
we have a mu x.,00:09:31.285,00:09:32.130
"That will be equal to cosine of
whatever is in front of the",00:09:32.130,00:09:37.890
"i, so cosine of mu x plus
i sine of mu x.",00:09:37.890,00:09:48.760
And then plus c2 times what?,00:09:48.760,00:09:55.710
"Times cosine of minus mu x plus
i sine of minus mu x.",00:09:55.710,00:10:12.355
"And let's see if we can
simplify this further.",00:10:12.355,00:10:15.380
"So one thing that you might--
So let's distribute the c's.",00:10:15.380,00:10:19.140
"So now we get-- I'll do it in
a different color-- actually",00:10:19.140,00:10:22.860
"I'm running out of time,
so I'll continue",00:10:22.860,00:10:24.430
this in the next video.,00:10:24.430,00:10:25.200
See you soon.,00:10:25.200,00:10:26.760
