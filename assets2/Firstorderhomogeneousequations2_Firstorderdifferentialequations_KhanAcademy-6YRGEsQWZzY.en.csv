"Let's do one more homogeneous
differential equation, or",00:00:01.010,00:00:04.120
"first order homogeneous
differential equation, to",00:00:04.120,00:00:06.190
"differentiate it from the
homogeneous linear",00:00:06.190,00:00:08.530
"differential equations
we'll do later.",00:00:08.530,00:00:09.810
"But anyway, the problem
we have here.",00:00:09.810,00:00:12.040
"It's the derivative of y with
respect to x is equal to--",00:00:12.040,00:00:18.110
"that x looks like a
y-- is equal to x",00:00:18.110,00:00:23.550
squared plus 3y squared.,00:00:23.550,00:00:28.090
"I'm writing it a little
bit small, so that I",00:00:28.090,00:00:30.312
don't run out of space.,00:00:30.312,00:00:31.970
Divided by 2xy.,00:00:31.970,00:00:35.670
"So in all of these homogeneous
equations-- and obviously, we",00:00:35.670,00:00:39.270
"don't know it's homogeneous
yet.",00:00:39.270,00:00:40.370
"So we have to try to write
it as a function of",00:00:40.370,00:00:43.440
y divided by x.,00:00:43.440,00:00:44.910
"So it looks like we could do
that, if we divide the top and",00:00:44.910,00:00:46.930
the bottom by x squared.,00:00:46.930,00:00:48.110
"So if we just multiply-- let
me do it in a different",00:00:48.110,00:00:50.450
"color-- 1 over x squared,
or x to the negative 2,",00:00:50.450,00:00:54.370
over 1 over x squared.,00:00:54.370,00:00:56.240
"We're essentially just
multiplying by 1.",00:00:56.240,00:00:58.370
"And then, that is
equal to what?",00:00:58.370,00:01:00.860
"1 plus 3y squared over x squared
divided by 2-- if you",00:01:00.860,00:01:11.370
"divide x, divide by x squared,
you just get a 1 over x-- so 2",00:01:11.370,00:01:14.110
times y over x.,00:01:14.110,00:01:16.610
"Or we could just rewrite the
whole thing, and this is just",00:01:16.610,00:01:19.730
"equal to 1 plus 3y over
x squared divided by 2",00:01:19.730,00:01:27.930
times y over x.,00:01:27.930,00:01:29.260
"So yes, this is a homogeneous
equation.",00:01:29.260,00:01:31.840
"Because we were able to write
it as a function of",00:01:31.840,00:01:34.260
y divided by x.,00:01:34.260,00:01:35.490
"So now, we can do the
substitution with v.",00:01:35.490,00:01:37.570
"And hopefully, this is starting
to become a little",00:01:37.570,00:01:39.200
bit of second nature to you.,00:01:39.200,00:01:40.750
"So we can make the substitution
that v is equal",00:01:40.750,00:01:43.610
"to y over x, or another way of
writing that is that y is",00:01:43.610,00:01:47.720
equal to xv.,00:01:47.720,00:01:50.660
"And then, of course, the
derivative of y with respect",00:01:50.660,00:01:53.150
"to x, or if we take the
derivative with respect to x",00:01:53.150,00:01:56.130
"of both sides of this, that's
equal to the derivative of x",00:01:56.130,00:01:59.100
"is 1 times v, this is just the
product rule, plus x times the",00:01:59.100,00:02:05.060
"derivative of v with
respect to x.",00:02:05.060,00:02:09.050
"And now, we can substitute the
derivative of y with respect",00:02:09.050,00:02:11.545
to x is just this.,00:02:11.545,00:02:13.490
"And then the right hand side
of the equation is this.",00:02:13.490,00:02:15.270
"But we can substitute
v for y over x.",00:02:15.270,00:02:17.360
So let's do that.,00:02:17.360,00:02:19.230
And so we get v plus x.,00:02:19.230,00:02:24.180
Instead of dv [? dv ?],00:02:24.180,00:02:25.020
"x, I'll write v prime for now,
just so that I don't take up",00:02:25.020,00:02:27.570
too much space.,00:02:27.570,00:02:29.150
"v prime is equal to 1 plus 3v
squared, we're making the",00:02:29.150,00:02:36.420
"substitution v is equal
to y over x.",00:02:36.420,00:02:38.475
All of that over 2v.,00:02:41.800,00:02:43.140
"Now, let's see what we can do.",00:02:46.320,00:02:47.290
"This is where we just get our
algebra hat on, and try to",00:02:47.290,00:02:49.970
"simplify until it's a separable
equation in v.",00:02:49.970,00:02:53.990
So let's do that.,00:02:53.990,00:02:54.860
"So let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 2v.",00:02:54.860,00:02:57.950
"So we'll get 2v squared plus 2xv
v prime-- 2v times x, yep,",00:02:57.950,00:03:08.250
"that's 2xv v prime-- is equal
to 1 plus 3v squared.",00:03:08.250,00:03:14.570
"Now let's see, let's subtract
2v squared from",00:03:14.570,00:03:16.760
both sides of this.,00:03:16.760,00:03:18.350
"And we will be left with 2xv v
prime is equal to 1 plus--",00:03:18.350,00:03:29.580
"let's see, we're subtracting
2v squared from both sides.",00:03:29.580,00:03:31.700
"So we're just left with a 1 plus
v squared here, right?",00:03:31.700,00:03:34.520
"3v squared minus 2v squared
is just v squared.",00:03:34.520,00:03:37.800
"And let's see, we want it to be
separable, so let's put all",00:03:37.800,00:03:40.080
the v's on the left hand side.,00:03:40.080,00:03:42.420
"So we get 2xv v prime
divided by 1 plus v",00:03:42.420,00:03:51.900
squared is equal to 1.,00:03:51.900,00:03:55.640
"And let's divide both
sides by x.",00:03:55.640,00:03:58.350
"So we get the x's on
the other side.",00:03:58.350,00:04:00.100
"So then we get 2v-- and
I'll now switch back",00:04:00.100,00:04:05.210
to the other notation.,00:04:05.210,00:04:06.100
"Instead of v prime,
I'll write dv dx.",00:04:06.100,00:04:11.520
"2v times the derivative of v
with respect to x divided by 1",00:04:11.520,00:04:15.760
"plus v squared is equal to-- I'm
dividing both sides by x,",00:04:15.760,00:04:20.140
"notice I didn't write the x on
this side-- so that is equal",00:04:20.140,00:04:22.200
to 1 over x.,00:04:22.200,00:04:24.560
"And then, if we just multiply
both sides of this times dx,",00:04:24.560,00:04:27.970
"we've separated the two
variables and we can integrate",00:04:27.970,00:04:30.310
both sides.,00:04:30.310,00:04:30.940
So let's do that.,00:04:30.940,00:04:32.710
Let's go up here.,00:04:32.710,00:04:33.530
"I'll switch to a different
color, so you know I'm working",00:04:33.530,00:04:35.290
on a different column now.,00:04:35.290,00:04:37.540
So multiply both sides by dx.,00:04:37.540,00:04:39.400
"I get 2v over 1 plus v squared
dv is equal to 1 over x dx.",00:04:39.400,00:04:51.050
"And now we can just integrate
both sides of this equation.",00:04:51.050,00:04:54.640
"This is a separable equation
in terms of v and x.",00:04:54.640,00:04:57.960
"And what's the integral
of this?",00:04:57.960,00:04:58.980
"At first, you might think, oh
boy, this is complicated.",00:04:58.980,00:05:00.860
"This is difficult, maybe some
type of trig function.",00:05:00.860,00:05:03.750
"But you'll see that it's
kind of just the",00:05:03.750,00:05:05.110
reverse chain rule.,00:05:05.110,00:05:06.740
"We have a function here,
1 plus v squared,",00:05:06.740,00:05:09.860
an expression here.,00:05:09.860,00:05:10.500
"And we have its derivative
sitting right there.",00:05:10.500,00:05:12.890
"So the antiderivative of this,
and you can make a",00:05:12.890,00:05:17.040
substitution if you like.,00:05:17.040,00:05:18.070
"You could say u is equal to 1
plus v squared, then du is",00:05:18.070,00:05:21.790
equal to 2v dv.,00:05:21.790,00:05:23.240
"And then, well, you would
end up saying that the",00:05:23.240,00:05:25.360
"antiderivative is just
the natural log of u.",00:05:25.360,00:05:27.320
"Or, in this case, the
antiderivative of this is just",00:05:27.320,00:05:30.760
"the natural log of
1 plus v squared.",00:05:30.760,00:05:35.640
"We don't even have to write
an absolute value there.",00:05:35.640,00:05:37.440
"Because that's always going
to be a positive value.",00:05:37.440,00:05:40.940
"So the natural log of
1 plus v squared.",00:05:40.940,00:05:44.820
"And I hope I didn't
confuse you.",00:05:44.820,00:05:48.260
That's how I think about it.,00:05:48.260,00:05:49.120
"I say, if I have an expression,
and I have its",00:05:49.120,00:05:51.670
"derivative multiplied there,
then I can just take the",00:05:51.670,00:05:54.630
"antiderivative of the
whole expression.",00:05:54.630,00:05:56.860
"And I don't have to worry about
what's inside of it.",00:05:56.860,00:05:59.060
"So if this was a 1 over an x,
or 1 over u, it's just the",00:05:59.060,00:06:01.980
natural log of it.,00:06:01.980,00:06:03.270
"So that's how I knew that this
was the antiderivative.",00:06:03.270,00:06:05.460
"And if you don't believe me,
use the chain rule and take",00:06:05.460,00:06:08.170
"the derivative of this,
and you'll get this.",00:06:08.170,00:06:09.770
"And hopefully, it will make
a little bit more sense.",00:06:09.770,00:06:11.570
"But anyway, that's the left
hand side, and then that",00:06:11.570,00:06:13.880
"equals-- Well, this
one's easy.",00:06:13.880,00:06:17.000
"That's the natural log, the
absolute value of x.",00:06:17.000,00:06:21.630
"We could say, plus c, but just
so that we can simplify it a",00:06:21.630,00:06:24.180
"little bit, an arbitrary
constant c, we can really just",00:06:24.180,00:06:27.640
"write that as the natural log of
the absolute value of some",00:06:27.640,00:06:31.100
constant c.,00:06:31.100,00:06:32.400
"I mean, this is still some
arbitrary constant c.",00:06:32.400,00:06:35.400
"So we can rewrite this whole
equation as the natural log of",00:06:35.400,00:06:40.880
"1 plus v squared is equal to--
when you add natural logs, you",00:06:40.880,00:06:45.900
"can essentially just multiply
the two numbers that you're",00:06:45.900,00:06:48.240
"taking the natural log of-- the
natural log of, we could",00:06:48.240,00:06:51.640
"say, the absolute value of cx.",00:06:51.640,00:06:54.710
"And so the natural log of
this is equal to the",00:06:54.710,00:06:56.760
natural log of this.,00:06:56.760,00:07:00.150
"So we could say that 1 plus
v squared is equal to cx.",00:07:00.150,00:07:07.010
"And now we can unsubstitute
it.",00:07:07.010,00:07:08.850
"So we know v is equal to y
over x, so let's do that.",00:07:08.850,00:07:12.700
"So we get 1 plus y over x
squared is equal to cx.",00:07:12.700,00:07:22.541
"Let me scroll this down
a little bit.",00:07:22.541,00:07:25.240
"Let's multiply both sides of the
equation times x squared.",00:07:25.240,00:07:29.100
"We could rewrite this as y
squared over x squared.",00:07:29.100,00:07:31.730
"So we multiply both sides times
x squared, you get x",00:07:31.730,00:07:34.900
"squared plus y squared is equal
to cx to the third.",00:07:34.900,00:07:41.500
And we're essentially done.,00:07:41.500,00:07:42.370
"If we want to put all of the
variable terms on left hand",00:07:42.370,00:07:45.040
"side, we could say that this is
equal to x squared plus y",00:07:45.040,00:07:49.010
"squared minus cx to the
third is equal to 0.",00:07:49.010,00:07:53.210
"And this implicitly defined
function, or curve, or however",00:07:53.210,00:07:57.200
"you want to call it, is the
solution to our original",00:07:57.200,00:08:00.980
"homogeneous first order
differential equation.",00:08:00.980,00:08:04.480
So there you go.,00:08:04.480,00:08:06.340
"I will see you in
the next video.",00:08:06.340,00:08:07.780
"And now, we're actually
going to do something.",00:08:07.780,00:08:09.340
"We're going to start embarking
on higher order",00:08:09.340,00:08:12.260
differential equations.,00:08:12.260,00:08:12.980
"And actually, these are more
useful, and in some ways,",00:08:12.980,00:08:15.190
"easier to do than the
homogeneous and the exact",00:08:15.190,00:08:17.630
"equations that we've
been doing so far.",00:08:17.630,00:08:19.740
See you in the next video.,00:08:19.740,00:08:21.720
