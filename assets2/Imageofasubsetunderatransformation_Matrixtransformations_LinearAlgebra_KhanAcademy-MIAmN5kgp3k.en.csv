"Let's say I have three position
vectors here in R2.",00:00:00.630,00:00:03.815
"Let me scroll this over
a little bit.",00:00:03.815,00:00:06.180
"Let's say my first position
vector is x0 and it is equal",00:00:06.180,00:00:11.900
"to minus 2, minus 2.",00:00:11.900,00:00:17.140
"So if I were to graph x0 I would
go minus 2, minus 2.",00:00:17.140,00:00:20.400
x0 looks like that.,00:00:20.400,00:00:24.430
"My next position vector I have
is x1 and I'll say that's",00:00:24.430,00:00:29.420
"equal to minus 2, 2.",00:00:29.420,00:00:33.002
"If I were to graph
here, minus 2, 2.",00:00:33.002,00:00:36.130
"That's my next position
vector right there.",00:00:36.130,00:00:39.740
And this is x1.,00:00:39.740,00:00:41.180
"And when I say it's a position
vector, they specify a",00:00:41.180,00:00:43.860
specific coordinate in R2.,00:00:43.860,00:00:46.510
"Let me draw a third one
just for fun, x2.",00:00:46.510,00:00:50.370
"Let's say that that is
equal to 2, minus 2.",00:00:50.370,00:00:58.400
"So if I were to draw this, 2
minus 2, it goes right here.",00:00:58.400,00:01:02.600
"So that vector right
there is x2.",00:01:02.600,00:01:06.860
"Now, what I'm curious
about or, I",00:01:06.860,00:01:09.070
"guess, not curious about.",00:01:09.070,00:01:10.560
"What I want to do here is define
the line segments that",00:01:10.560,00:01:13.570
connect these points.,00:01:13.570,00:01:14.900
"So let's say I have my
first line segment.",00:01:14.900,00:01:17.820
"Let me call it L1, or
let me call it L0.",00:01:17.820,00:01:22.350
"And I want it to be the
line segment that",00:01:22.350,00:01:23.860
connects x0 to x1.,00:01:23.860,00:01:25.350
How can I construct that?,00:01:25.350,00:01:27.560
"So I want to construct this line
segment right here, this",00:01:27.560,00:01:30.650
"little-- let me do it in a
different color actually.",00:01:30.650,00:01:33.240
"Let me do it in orange, L0.",00:01:33.240,00:01:35.390
"So what I want to do is I want
to find the set of all of",00:01:35.390,00:01:38.540
"these values right here, all of
the position vectors that",00:01:38.540,00:01:41.370
"define points on this
line right there.",00:01:41.370,00:01:44.490
"Well we could define it as,
we could start off at x0.",00:01:44.490,00:01:48.890
"We could say that orange line is
x0 plus scaled versions of",00:01:48.890,00:01:55.310
the difference of x1 and x0.,00:01:55.310,00:01:57.580
"If you take x1 minus x0, you get
this vector right there.",00:01:57.580,00:02:00.740
That's x1 minus x0.,00:02:00.740,00:02:04.530
That orange vector.,00:02:04.530,00:02:05.470
"I know I wrote it right there
so it's hard to read.",00:02:05.470,00:02:07.080
"But if you just take x1 minus x0
you get that and that make",00:02:07.080,00:02:09.940
"sense. x0 plus this orange
vector is equal",00:02:09.940,00:02:11.990
to that blue factor.,00:02:11.990,00:02:13.270
"So if you just take different
scaled up versions of this",00:02:13.270,00:02:16.130
"guy, you're going to
end up at different",00:02:16.130,00:02:17.640
points in this direction.,00:02:17.640,00:02:19.810
"We're starting at x0, maybe
I should do that in green.",00:02:19.810,00:02:23.020
"We're starting at x0 and then
we're going to add up scaled",00:02:23.020,00:02:26.340
"up versions of this orange
vector, which is just the",00:02:26.340,00:02:29.540
difference of x1 and x0.,00:02:29.540,00:02:31.550
Let me write that.,00:02:31.550,00:02:32.255
"So scaled up versions
of x1 minus x0.",00:02:32.255,00:02:39.230
"Now, we have to constrict.",00:02:39.230,00:02:40.850
"If we just want to be in this
line segment, we have to",00:02:40.850,00:02:43.220
constrict Rt.,00:02:43.220,00:02:44.200
"If we said t was a member of
real numbers, if it was any",00:02:44.200,00:02:47.300
"real number, then we would
essentially be defining the",00:02:47.300,00:02:49.530
"set of this entire vertical
line going up and down to",00:02:49.530,00:02:53.700
"infinity in the upwards
direction and",00:02:53.700,00:02:56.990
the downwards direction.,00:02:56.990,00:02:57.810
"But we just want to restrict
it to start here",00:02:57.810,00:03:00.210
and then go up here.,00:03:00.210,00:03:01.110
"And it doesn't necessarily have
to have any direction.",00:03:01.110,00:03:04.740
"We could say this is true, our
little line segment here is",00:03:04.740,00:03:07.900
"true, for t-- let me
write it this way.",00:03:07.900,00:03:12.010
"t is greater than
or equal to 0.",00:03:12.010,00:03:15.160
"So when t equals 0, this term
cancels out and we just have",00:03:15.160,00:03:18.410
"this point or this position
right here.",00:03:18.410,00:03:21.140
Let me draw it in green.,00:03:21.140,00:03:23.410
"We just have that
position there.",00:03:23.410,00:03:25.070
"And then t is going to be
less than or equal to 1.",00:03:25.070,00:03:28.140
"What happens when
t is equal to 1?",00:03:28.140,00:03:30.060
"When t is equal to 1, this
becomes x1 minus x0.",00:03:30.060,00:03:33.960
You have an x0 there.,00:03:33.960,00:03:35.030
"This x0 and that x0 cancel out
and you're just at this point",00:03:35.030,00:03:37.980
right there.,00:03:37.980,00:03:38.710
"When t is equal to 1/2, just
to make sure this all make",00:03:38.710,00:03:41.890
"sense to you, what happens?",00:03:41.890,00:03:43.030
"You have x1 minus x0, which is
this orange vector right here.",00:03:43.030,00:03:47.080
"When t is equal to 1/2 you're
essentially scaling that",00:03:47.080,00:03:49.320
"orange vector by half and you
end up right at that point,",00:03:49.320,00:03:52.480
"which is exactly where
you want to be.",00:03:52.480,00:03:53.710
"You want halfway along
that line segment.",00:03:53.710,00:03:55.290
"At t is equal to 0.25, you're
going to be here.",00:03:55.290,00:03:57.810
"t is equal to 0.75, you're
going to be there.",00:03:57.810,00:03:59.670
"So at any value for t being any
real number between 0 and",00:03:59.670,00:04:03.890
"1, you're going to end up at all
of the points along that",00:04:03.890,00:04:06.800
line segment.,00:04:06.800,00:04:07.520
So that's our L0.,00:04:07.520,00:04:10.500
It's just a set of vectors.,00:04:10.500,00:04:13.510
"Now we can do the same exercise
if we wanted to find",00:04:13.510,00:04:16.260
"out the line, the equation
of the line, that goes",00:04:16.260,00:04:19.700
between x1 and x2.,00:04:19.700,00:04:23.860
"If we wanted to find the
equation of that line, we",00:04:23.860,00:04:25.970
could call this L1.,00:04:25.970,00:04:27.220
"And L1 would be equal to x1 plus
t times x2 minus x1 for 0",00:04:30.330,00:04:41.140
"is less than or equal to t is
less than or equal to 1.",00:04:41.140,00:04:43.640
That's L1.,00:04:43.640,00:04:44.740
"And then finally, if we want
to make a triangle out of",00:04:44.740,00:04:47.140
"this, let's define this
line right here.",00:04:47.140,00:04:50.100
Let's define that as L2.,00:04:50.100,00:04:52.320
"L2 would be equal to the set
of all of vectors where you",00:04:52.320,00:04:56.270
start off at x2.,00:04:56.270,00:04:59.530
"Set of all of vectors that are
x2 plus some scaled up sum of",00:04:59.530,00:05:03.860
x0 minus x2.,00:05:03.860,00:05:05.230
"x0 minus x2 is this
vector right here.",00:05:05.230,00:05:07.650
"So x0 minus x2 such that 0 is
less than or equal to t is",00:05:07.650,00:05:16.020
less than or equal to 1.,00:05:16.020,00:05:18.430
"And so if you take the
combination, if you were to",00:05:18.430,00:05:20.900
"define kind of a super set-- I
could have defined my shape",00:05:20.900,00:05:27.620
"as-- let's say it's the union
of all of those guys.",00:05:27.620,00:05:33.070
"Well, let me just write it.",00:05:33.070,00:05:34.310
"L0, L1, and L2.",00:05:34.310,00:05:37.410
"Then you'd have a nice
triangle here.",00:05:37.410,00:05:40.550
"If you take the union of all of
these three sets, you get",00:05:40.550,00:05:44.670
that nice triangle there.,00:05:44.670,00:05:46.080
"Now, what I want to do in this
video, I think this is all a",00:05:46.080,00:05:48.790
bit of review for you.,00:05:48.790,00:05:49.640
"But it's maybe a different way
of looking at things than",00:05:49.640,00:05:51.510
"we've done in the past. Is
I want to understand what",00:05:51.510,00:05:53.550
"happens to this set right here
when I take a transformation,",00:05:53.550,00:05:59.240
"a linear transformation,
of it?",00:05:59.240,00:06:01.580
"So let me define a
transformation.",00:06:01.580,00:06:04.630
"I'll make it a fairly
straightforward",00:06:04.630,00:06:07.100
transformation.,00:06:07.100,00:06:08.690
"Let me define my transformation
of x, of any x,",00:06:08.690,00:06:12.730
"to be equal to the matrix
1 minus 1, 2, 0 times",00:06:12.730,00:06:21.630
whatever vector x.,00:06:21.630,00:06:22.970
"So times x1, x2.",00:06:22.970,00:06:24.960
"And we know that any linear
transformation can actually be",00:06:24.960,00:06:27.680
"written as a matrix
and vice versa.",00:06:27.680,00:06:30.010
"So you might have said, hey,
you know, you're giving an",00:06:30.010,00:06:31.730
"example with the matrix, what
about all those other ways to",00:06:31.730,00:06:33.580
write in your transformation?,00:06:33.580,00:06:34.320
"You can write all of
those as a matrix.",00:06:34.320,00:06:36.580
"So let's translate-- let's try
to figure out what this is",00:06:36.580,00:06:39.580
going to look like.,00:06:39.580,00:06:41.410
"What our triangle is going to
look like when we transform",00:06:41.410,00:06:45.060
every point in it.,00:06:45.060,00:06:48.700
"Let me take the transformation
first. The transformation of",00:06:48.700,00:06:52.650
"L0 is equal to the
transformation of this thing.",00:06:52.650,00:06:59.710
"This is just one of the
particular members.",00:06:59.710,00:07:02.050
"For a particular t,
this is one of the",00:07:02.050,00:07:03.730
particular members of L0.,00:07:03.730,00:07:04.830
"So it's going to be equal to the
transformation of x0 minus",00:07:04.830,00:07:12.900
"the transformation of x1 minus
x0 such that-- sorry.",00:07:12.900,00:07:19.950
Minus t times x1 minus x0.,00:07:19.950,00:07:22.130
"That's a lowercase t, not
the transformation.",00:07:22.130,00:07:24.250
"Such that 0 is less than or
equal to t is less than or",00:07:24.250,00:07:27.590
equal to 1.,00:07:27.590,00:07:28.770
Let me switch colors.,00:07:28.770,00:07:30.280
"This, just by the properties
of linear transformations,",00:07:30.280,00:07:33.720
"this is equal to the
transformation-- let me put",00:07:33.720,00:07:35.920
"the brackets out-- of x0 minus
the transformation of our",00:07:35.920,00:07:41.730
"scalar t times x1 minus x0 for
all t's between 0 and 1.",00:07:41.730,00:07:51.000
"That part is getting a little
redundant to keep saying it.",00:07:51.000,00:07:53.750
"And then, what does
this equal to?",00:07:53.750,00:07:55.540
"If you I take the transformation
of a scaled up",00:07:55.540,00:07:57.420
"vector, that's just
the scaled up",00:07:57.420,00:07:58.710
transformation of that vector.,00:07:58.710,00:07:59.970
"So this is going to be equal
to this part, the",00:07:59.970,00:08:03.290
"transformation of x0 minus t,
our scalar multiple t, times",00:08:03.290,00:08:10.250
"the transformation of the
vector x1 minus x0.",00:08:10.250,00:08:15.200
"And then let me make sure I
get my parentheses right.",00:08:15.200,00:08:17.250
"Such that 0 is less than or
equal to t is less than or",00:08:17.250,00:08:19.730
equal to 1.,00:08:19.730,00:08:20.590
"And then the transformation of
the sum of two vectors is",00:08:20.590,00:08:23.510
"equal to the sum of their
transformations.",00:08:23.510,00:08:25.370
We've all seen this before.,00:08:25.370,00:08:27.070
"So our transformation of our
first line-- this one right",00:08:27.070,00:08:31.370
"here-- L0, is equal to the set
where it's the transformation",00:08:31.370,00:08:37.669
"of x0 minus t times the
transformation of x1 minus the",00:08:37.669,00:08:46.830
transformation of x0.,00:08:46.830,00:08:49.580
"And we've just done our
first line so far.",00:08:49.580,00:08:52.420
I have a parentheses there.,00:08:52.420,00:08:54.070
"For 0 is less than t is less
than or equal to 1.",00:08:54.070,00:08:57.820
"Now this is a pretty neat
result and it's going to",00:08:57.820,00:09:00.010
simplify our lives a lot.,00:09:00.010,00:09:01.950
"The transformation of the line
segment that goes from x0 to",00:09:01.950,00:09:11.220
"x1 ends up just being the line
segment that goes from the",00:09:11.220,00:09:16.420
"transformation of x0 to the
transformation of x1.",00:09:16.420,00:09:20.450
Let me make this clear.,00:09:20.450,00:09:21.170
"What is the transformation
of x0?",00:09:21.170,00:09:22.750
Let's calculate these things.,00:09:22.750,00:09:24.680
"So x0 was minus 2, minus 2.",00:09:24.680,00:09:29.630
"Let me write out the
transformation of x0.",00:09:29.630,00:09:33.030
"So the transformation of x0 is
equal to-- let me write it",00:09:33.030,00:09:38.500
"out, so I don't make any
careless mistakes.",00:09:38.500,00:09:40.130
"1, 2, minus 1, 0 times minus
2 minus, minus 2.",00:09:40.130,00:09:45.920
"And so what would this
be equal to?",00:09:45.920,00:09:47.990
"1 minus 2 minus-- so it's
1 minus 2 plus minus",00:09:47.990,00:09:52.860
1 times minus 2.,00:09:52.860,00:09:53.760
That's going to be plus 2.,00:09:53.760,00:09:54.670
"So it's minus 2 plus a plus
2, so it's equal to 0.",00:09:54.670,00:09:57.910
"And then we have 2 times minus
2, which is minus 4.",00:09:57.910,00:10:02.200
2 times minus 4.,00:10:02.200,00:10:03.280
"And then plus 0 times,
so it's minus 4.",00:10:03.280,00:10:06.000
"So that's the transformation
of x0.",00:10:06.000,00:10:08.345
Let me graph it.,00:10:08.345,00:10:09.940
So it's 0 minus 4.,00:10:09.940,00:10:12.690
So our x0 vector.,00:10:12.690,00:10:15.400
"So this is the transformation
of x0.",00:10:15.400,00:10:18.260
"So the transformation associated
this vector with",00:10:18.260,00:10:23.480
"this vector down here, the one
that goes straight down.",00:10:23.480,00:10:26.300
"Now let me take the
transformation",00:10:26.300,00:10:27.420
of the other guys.,00:10:27.420,00:10:28.930
The transformation of x1.,00:10:28.930,00:10:30.480
I'll just do it right here.,00:10:30.480,00:10:32.110
I'm running out of space.,00:10:32.110,00:10:33.660
"The transformation of x1 is
equal to 1, 2, minus 1, 0",00:10:33.660,00:10:39.420
"times minus 2, 2.",00:10:39.420,00:10:42.685
So what is this equal to?,00:10:46.830,00:10:48.520
"This is equal to 1 times minus
2, plus minus 1 times 2.",00:10:48.520,00:10:53.580
So that's minus 4.,00:10:53.580,00:10:55.460
"And then 2 times minus
2 is minus 4.",00:10:55.460,00:10:59.520
Plus 0.,00:10:59.520,00:11:00.190
"So minus 4, minus 4.",00:11:00.190,00:11:04.180
"So x1 is minus 4, minus 4.",00:11:04.180,00:11:07.390
So our x1 looks like this.,00:11:07.390,00:11:10.020
"Our transformation of x1 is this
vector right here in R2.",00:11:10.020,00:11:15.290
"Our transformation is
going from R2 to R2.",00:11:15.290,00:11:18.250
"So that's why I'm able to draw
them both on this nice",00:11:18.250,00:11:21.560
Cartesian coordinate plane.,00:11:21.560,00:11:23.010
And we have one left.,00:11:23.010,00:11:24.380
"Let's take our transformation
of x2.",00:11:24.380,00:11:27.490
"So the transformation of x2 is
equal to our transformation",00:11:27.490,00:11:33.820
"matrix 1, 2, minus 1,
0 times 2, minus 2.",00:11:33.820,00:11:41.760
"And so this will be equal
to 1 times 2 is 2.",00:11:41.760,00:11:46.610
Plus minus 1 times minus 2.,00:11:46.610,00:11:48.630
So it's 2 plus 2 is 4.,00:11:48.630,00:11:50.940
And then have 2 times 2 is 4.,00:11:50.940,00:11:53.440
Plus 0 times minus 2.,00:11:53.440,00:11:55.770
"So it's 4, 4.",00:11:55.770,00:11:58.560
"So x2 is 4, 4.",00:11:58.560,00:12:00.420
So it's this point right here.,00:12:00.420,00:12:02.020
"4, 4 right there.",00:12:02.020,00:12:04.130
"So the transformation of x2 is
that vector right there.",00:12:07.030,00:12:11.030
"And so, we are able to take the
transformation of each of",00:12:11.030,00:12:14.340
these points of this triangle.,00:12:14.340,00:12:16.470
"But who knows what the
transformation does to",00:12:16.470,00:12:19.110
"everything in between, to all
of these other-- the actual",00:12:19.110,00:12:21.590
sides of the triangle.,00:12:21.590,00:12:23.220
"We're able to do a little
math and we just",00:12:23.220,00:12:24.940
did the first side.,00:12:24.940,00:12:25.910
"We just did L0 right there
we found, just using the",00:12:25.910,00:12:29.230
"properties of a linear
transformation, the definition",00:12:29.230,00:12:31.510
"of a linear transformation
actually, we were able to find",00:12:31.510,00:12:34.070
"that the transformation of L0 of
this vertical line here, it",00:12:34.070,00:12:39.480
"just ends up becoming the line
where we can start off at the",00:12:39.480,00:12:43.170
transformation of x0.,00:12:43.170,00:12:44.550
"The point specified by this
vector right here.",00:12:47.140,00:12:49.780
"And to that I add up scaled
multiples of the",00:12:49.780,00:12:52.540
"transformation of x1 minus
the transformation of x0.",00:12:52.540,00:12:56.040
"What is this, the transformation
of x1 minus the",00:12:56.040,00:13:00.560
transformation of x0?,00:13:00.560,00:13:02.110
"The transformation of x1 is just
this vector right here.",00:13:02.110,00:13:05.450
"The transformation of x0
is just that vector.",00:13:05.450,00:13:07.880
"So this whole term right here is
just this vector minus that",00:13:07.880,00:13:10.800
"vectors or it's this
vector right there.",00:13:10.800,00:13:14.170
"It's just that vector
right there.",00:13:14.170,00:13:15.920
"And so, what we essentially
have, we've defined the same",00:13:15.920,00:13:18.960
"way that we did in the first
part of this video.",00:13:18.960,00:13:21.430
"This is just the same thing as
the line segment that connects",00:13:21.430,00:13:24.900
"the point defined here and
the point defined there.",00:13:24.900,00:13:27.870
"We took the difference of the
two and we have scaled up",00:13:27.870,00:13:30.390
"versions of that between
t is equal to 0 and 1.",00:13:30.390,00:13:33.930
"So the transformation of L0
really just became the",00:13:33.930,00:13:36.480
"transformation-- is just
the line between the",00:13:36.480,00:13:39.040
"transformations of both of the
endpoints, which is a pretty",00:13:39.040,00:13:42.260
neat result.,00:13:42.260,00:13:43.210
It makes our lives simple.,00:13:43.210,00:13:45.530
"We can do the exact same logic
to say, you know what?",00:13:45.530,00:13:47.910
"What's going to be the
transformation of L1?",00:13:47.910,00:13:52.880
"Well L1 was between the
points x1 and x2.",00:13:52.880,00:13:57.130
"It was between that point
and that point.",00:13:57.130,00:13:59.940
That was L1.,00:13:59.940,00:14:02.060
"So using the same logic,
we can do the",00:14:02.060,00:14:04.020
math all over again.,00:14:04.020,00:14:05.160
But it applies to any line.,00:14:05.160,00:14:06.540
I did it all abstractly here.,00:14:06.540,00:14:08.500
"The transformation of L1 is
going to be the line that",00:14:08.500,00:14:13.030
"connects the transformation
of the two endpoints.",00:14:13.030,00:14:15.420
"So it's going to be the
line that connects the",00:14:15.420,00:14:16.830
"transformation of x1 and the
transformation of x2.",00:14:16.830,00:14:19.930
"Let me make this right here, is
the transformation of L1.",00:14:22.880,00:14:27.630
"This right here is the
transformation of L0.",00:14:27.630,00:14:32.850
"And then finally, what's the
transformation of L2?",00:14:32.850,00:14:36.190
"L2 connects the points
x2 and x0.",00:14:38.750,00:14:43.330
So that is L2 right there.,00:14:43.330,00:14:45.760
"So the transformation of it
using the same math that we've",00:14:45.760,00:14:48.590
"done before is really just
the line connecting the",00:14:48.590,00:14:51.140
"transformations of
those two points.",00:14:51.140,00:14:53.540
"So the transformation of L2 is
going to be equal to the line",00:14:53.540,00:14:56.950
"that connects the transformation
of x2 to the",00:14:56.950,00:14:59.410
transformation of x0.,00:14:59.410,00:15:00.920
"So it's going to be that
line right there.",00:15:00.920,00:15:02.570
"So this is the transformation
of L2, or if we defined our",00:15:05.390,00:15:11.120
"whole shape or our whole
triangle as the set of all of",00:15:11.120,00:15:14.060
"these, the transformation
of that.",00:15:14.060,00:15:16.160
"So the transformation of
our whole shape is",00:15:16.160,00:15:20.750
now this skewed triangle.,00:15:20.750,00:15:22.880
"I think you're now getting a
sense of why this might be",00:15:22.880,00:15:24.900
"useful in things like computer
graphics or game development.",00:15:24.900,00:15:28.020
"Because when you look at things
from different angles,",00:15:28.020,00:15:29.920
"you start to skew them
and whatever else.",00:15:29.920,00:15:32.160
"But taking this transformation,
we were able",00:15:32.160,00:15:34.920
"to turn this set of vectors or
the positions-- or I guess",00:15:34.920,00:15:41.280
"this shape, which is specified
by this set of",00:15:41.280,00:15:44.860
vectors right here.,00:15:44.860,00:15:45.660
"We were able to change it into
this shape in R2 specified by",00:15:45.660,00:15:48.945
a different set of vectors.,00:15:48.945,00:15:50.970
"But the whole takeaway from this
video is, you don't have",00:15:50.970,00:15:55.610
"to individually figure out,
gee, what does this point",00:15:55.610,00:16:00.280
"right here translate
into over here?",00:16:00.280,00:16:02.540
"All you have to say is what
were my endpoints?",00:16:02.540,00:16:04.450
"Figure out their transformations
and then",00:16:04.450,00:16:06.450
"connect the dots in
the same order.",00:16:06.450,00:16:08.140
"That's what is essentially the
big takeaway from here.",00:16:08.140,00:16:11.470
"And this idea of when you
transform one set into another",00:16:11.470,00:16:15.350
"set, they have some terminology",00:16:15.350,00:16:17.690
associated with it.,00:16:17.690,00:16:19.100
"So let's say the transformation
of L0.",00:16:19.100,00:16:21.760
"L0 was the set of vectors
that specified",00:16:21.760,00:16:25.010
this line right here.,00:16:25.010,00:16:27.240
"The transformation of L0, which
is this set, is a set of",00:16:27.240,00:16:37.000
vectors-- sorry.,00:16:37.000,00:16:38.190
L0 was this set.,00:16:38.190,00:16:42.000
"It was the set of vectors in our
co-domain that specified",00:16:42.000,00:16:46.720
these points.,00:16:46.720,00:16:48.000
"This is called the image
of L0 under T.",00:16:48.000,00:16:58.780
And it kind of makes sense.,00:16:58.780,00:17:01.490
Why do they call it the image?,00:17:01.490,00:17:02.750
"Because t is taking this thing
right here, this L0, and kind",00:17:02.750,00:17:08.859
"of distorting it or creating
a new image",00:17:08.859,00:17:11.780
of it in the co-domain.,00:17:11.780,00:17:13.810
"It's taking a set in the domain
and creating a new",00:17:13.810,00:17:16.540
"image of it in the co-domain
right there.",00:17:16.540,00:17:19.939
"We could say that t of the
transformation of our entire",00:17:22.589,00:17:27.250
"shape, I defined our entire
shape up here as this whole",00:17:27.250,00:17:31.400
triangle right there.,00:17:31.400,00:17:32.920
"That's the image and that
turned into this purple",00:17:32.920,00:17:36.440
triangle here.,00:17:36.440,00:17:37.630
That's the image of s under T.,00:17:37.630,00:17:43.710
"So hopefully you found that
pretty interesting.",00:17:43.710,00:17:45.060
"This is actually a super useful
takeaway if you ever",00:17:45.060,00:17:47.080
"want to become a 3D programmer
of some type.",00:17:47.080,00:17:50.740
"In then next video, we'll
explore what happens when s is",00:17:50.740,00:17:54.580
"no longer just a subset
of our domain.",00:17:54.580,00:17:57.590
"Everything we've been dealing
so far-- L0, L1, and L2, or",00:17:57.590,00:18:01.120
"our entire triangle, these
were all subsets or Rn.",00:18:01.120,00:18:04.380
"In the next video we'll talk
about what happens when you",00:18:04.380,00:18:06.040
"take the transformation
of all of Rn.",00:18:06.040,00:18:08.660
