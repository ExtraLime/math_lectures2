"Let's take a little bit of a
hiatus from our more rigorous",00:00:00.730,00:00:03.810
"math where we're building the
mathematics of vector algebra",00:00:03.810,00:00:06.570
"and just think a little bit
about something that you'll",00:00:06.570,00:00:09.310
"probably encounter if you ever
have to have to write a",00:00:09.310,00:00:11.080
"three-dimensional computer
program or have to do any",00:00:11.080,00:00:13.230
"mathematics dealing with
three dimensions.",00:00:13.230,00:00:15.300
"And that's the idea of just the
equation of a plane in R3.",00:00:15.300,00:00:26.880
And you know what a plane is.,00:00:26.880,00:00:28.120
"I mean we live in a
three-dimensional world and we",00:00:28.120,00:00:29.880
see planes all around us.,00:00:29.880,00:00:31.200
"The surface of your monitor, of
your computer monitor is a",00:00:31.200,00:00:34.580
"plane, regardless of what
angle you hold it at.",00:00:34.580,00:00:36.910
"And I can draw here in
three dimensions.",00:00:36.910,00:00:38.750
"Let me do a little bit
better job than that.",00:00:42.400,00:00:44.840
"So let's say that that
is the x-axis.",00:00:44.840,00:00:49.220
This is my y-axis.,00:00:49.220,00:00:51.850
And then that's my z-axis.,00:00:51.850,00:00:55.110
"And we know what a
plane looks like.",00:00:55.110,00:00:57.820
it looks something like that.,00:00:57.820,00:00:59.840
"I'm just drawing it at an
arbitrary angle and it goes",00:00:59.840,00:01:01.950
off in every direction.,00:01:01.950,00:01:04.980
"Now, the equation of a
plane-- and you've",00:01:04.980,00:01:06.870
probably seen this before.,00:01:06.870,00:01:09.430
"It's a linear function
of x, y and z.",00:01:09.430,00:01:11.390
"So it's ax plus by plus
cz is equal to d.",00:01:11.390,00:01:18.450
"If this is the graph on that
plane, then that means that",00:01:18.450,00:01:20.720
"every point on this plane, every
x, y and z on this plane",00:01:20.720,00:01:28.090
satisfies this equation.,00:01:28.090,00:01:30.085
"Now another way, just as valid
a way to specify a point or",00:01:30.085,00:01:34.150
"specify a plane is to give you
an actual point on the plane.",00:01:34.150,00:01:38.480
"So we'll say, look, that's
the point on the plane.",00:01:38.480,00:01:42.670
"Let's say that this is the
point x0, y0, and z0.",00:01:42.670,00:01:48.800
"It could be one of the instances
of this point right",00:01:48.800,00:01:51.420
"here, but I'm just saying
this is another point",00:01:51.420,00:01:52.800
that's on the plane.,00:01:52.800,00:01:54.260
"That obviously by itself isn't
going to specify the plane.",00:01:54.260,00:01:57.940
"You could pivot the plane
around that point in an",00:01:57.940,00:02:00.030
infinite number of ways.,00:02:00.030,00:02:01.470
"But if you specify that point
and you specify a vector",00:02:01.470,00:02:05.090
"that's perpendicular to the
plane-- and I can draw that",00:02:05.090,00:02:09.240
"starting from here, but I can
shift a vector wherever.",00:02:09.240,00:02:11.460
"But let me just draw
it right there.",00:02:11.460,00:02:12.950
"So if I also specify a normal
vector to the plane.",00:02:12.950,00:02:18.210
"And I just used a word that I
haven't defined for you yet.",00:02:18.210,00:02:20.400
"But when I say a normal
vector, so",00:02:20.400,00:02:22.280
n is a normal vector.,00:02:22.280,00:02:25.280
"Or which just means that it's
perpendicular to the plane.",00:02:28.100,00:02:30.990
"It's perpendicular to everything
on the plane.",00:02:30.990,00:02:33.450
"It's perpendicular to every
vector on the plane.",00:02:33.450,00:02:36.680
"Perpendicular to, I guess the
best way to say it, I'll just",00:02:36.680,00:02:39.270
"say it in very imprecise
terms--",00:02:39.270,00:02:40.850
everything on the plane.,00:02:40.850,00:02:45.570
"So if you have some vectors
lying on the plane, if I have",00:02:45.570,00:02:49.730
"some vector here, let's say
that's lying on the plane.",00:02:49.730,00:02:52.050
"If you imagine the plane as
a piece of cardboard, that",00:02:52.050,00:02:54.960
"yellow arrow I just drew-- I
would've actually drawn that",00:02:54.960,00:02:58.450
on the cardboard.,00:02:58.450,00:02:59.240
It's sitting on the plane.,00:02:59.240,00:03:00.670
"If this yellow vector, let me
call it vector a, then if this",00:03:00.670,00:03:05.280
"is just some arbitrary vector
sitting on the plane and this",00:03:05.280,00:03:07.970
"is the normal vector through
the plane, we know from our",00:03:07.970,00:03:11.810
"definition of vector angles that
this is perpendicular to",00:03:11.810,00:03:15.810
"this if and only if, n dot a--
only if the dot product of",00:03:15.810,00:03:23.090
"these two things
are equal to 0.",00:03:23.090,00:03:25.350
"And that's true for any vector
that we pick that actually",00:03:25.350,00:03:28.050
lies on the plane.,00:03:28.050,00:03:29.680
"So let's see if we can use this
definition of a plane, if",00:03:29.680,00:03:35.470
"we can use the-- I'll call it
the normal or let me call it",00:03:35.470,00:03:40.870
"the n plus-- let me
do it this way.",00:03:40.870,00:03:44.700
"The n plus some x0,
y0, z0 definition.",00:03:44.700,00:03:54.390
"And if I can go from that to
just the standard linear",00:03:54.390,00:03:59.950
"equation definition, ax plus
by plus cz is equal to 0.",00:03:59.950,00:04:07.010
"Let's see if there's some way
based on what we already know",00:04:07.010,00:04:09.420
"and using this information
that we can do that.",00:04:09.420,00:04:11.730
"So the way to think about it,
this point, this little blue",00:04:11.730,00:04:14.350
"point that lies on the plane,
I can specify it",00:04:14.350,00:04:16.570
by a position vector.,00:04:16.570,00:04:18.390
"So let me set some position
vector x0 to be equal to-- so",00:04:18.390,00:04:22.950
"I'm going to define x0
to be equal to the",00:04:22.950,00:04:27.470
"scalar x0, y0, z0.",00:04:27.470,00:04:30.855
And I want to be very clear.,00:04:30.855,00:04:32.630
"This specifies the coordinate
that lies on the plane.",00:04:32.630,00:04:36.240
"This vector does not lie
entirely on the plane.",00:04:36.240,00:04:39.750
"The way I drew it right here,
it's starting at the origin.",00:04:39.750,00:04:41.620
It's a position vector.,00:04:41.620,00:04:42.870
"And the way I drew it it's
behind the plane.",00:04:42.870,00:04:45.840
"The tip of its arrow
sits on the plane.",00:04:45.840,00:04:48.180
"But this vector itself,
it's not necessarily",00:04:48.180,00:04:50.330
drawn on the plane.,00:04:50.330,00:04:51.640
"This plane might not even go
through the origin, while this",00:04:51.640,00:04:54.210
"vector does touch
on the origin.",00:04:54.210,00:04:56.270
"It just specifies some
point on the plane.",00:04:56.270,00:04:59.300
"Similarly, let me define
another vector.",00:04:59.300,00:05:01.440
"I said this was some other
arbitrary point on the plane",00:05:01.440,00:05:04.210
"xyz, and so you know,
this is true for any",00:05:04.210,00:05:07.800
point on the plane.,00:05:07.800,00:05:08.380
"Let me define another vector
x, and I'm going to define",00:05:08.380,00:05:11.490
"that as x, y, and z.",00:05:11.490,00:05:14.710
"So once again, like x0, the
vector x-- let me draw it",00:05:14.710,00:05:17.980
right there.,00:05:17.980,00:05:19.790
"This vector x does not
lie on the plane.",00:05:19.790,00:05:23.690
It goes from the origin.,00:05:23.690,00:05:24.890
"It's a position vector
that specifies a",00:05:24.890,00:05:27.260
point on the plane.,00:05:27.260,00:05:29.320
"So it goes from the origin
and it goes out.",00:05:29.320,00:05:31.240
"And you can almost view them
as if the plane was like a",00:05:31.240,00:05:34.200
"coffee table that this would
kind of be these vectors.",00:05:34.200,00:05:37.060
Let me see if I can draw it.,00:05:37.060,00:05:39.020
"If this was the flat surface of
the plane that the vector",00:05:39.020,00:05:43.470
"x0 is going from the origin
to specify some",00:05:43.470,00:05:46.380
point on the plane.,00:05:46.380,00:05:48.180
"And then the vector x is also
going from the origin to",00:05:48.180,00:05:51.570
"specify-- let me do it
in a different color.",00:05:51.570,00:05:54.550
"The vector x is also going from
the origin to specify",00:05:54.550,00:05:59.410
"some other point on the
plane right there.",00:05:59.410,00:06:01.970
"I just took the plane and made
it flat, so you see it right",00:06:01.970,00:06:04.870
along its side.,00:06:04.870,00:06:06.790
"If you could imagine sitting
right at the surface of the",00:06:06.790,00:06:09.240
"plane and then you could see
that these guys clearly do not",00:06:09.240,00:06:12.170
lie in the plane.,00:06:12.170,00:06:13.680
"But using these guys, I can
construct a vector that does",00:06:13.680,00:06:16.460
lie on the plane.,00:06:16.460,00:06:19.080
"What does the vector x
minus x0 look like?",00:06:19.080,00:06:23.253
"Well, I just drew a little
triangle here. x minus x0--",00:06:26.080,00:06:31.420
"I'll do it in this
green color.",00:06:31.420,00:06:33.300
"It'll look exactly like this. x
minus x0 will be this green",00:06:33.300,00:06:37.130
line right here.,00:06:37.130,00:06:39.270
This is x minus x0.,00:06:39.270,00:06:42.670
"We could view x0 plus this
vector plus x minus x0 is",00:06:42.670,00:06:46.460
going to be equal to x.,00:06:46.460,00:06:47.590
"If I were to do it on this
graph, it's going",00:06:47.590,00:06:49.345
to look like this.,00:06:49.345,00:06:50.130
It's going to be like this.,00:06:50.130,00:06:53.540
"So let me draw it better
than that.",00:06:53.540,00:06:55.550
"It's going to go from that
point from x0, the point",00:06:55.550,00:06:58.250
"specified by x0 to the
point specified by x.",00:06:58.250,00:07:01.500
"And it's going to lie
along the plane.",00:07:01.500,00:07:03.660
"So this right here
is x minus x0.",00:07:03.660,00:07:07.220
"I know this drawing is getting
very dirty, but you can see",00:07:07.220,00:07:10.110
"that this is definitely
lying on the plane.",00:07:10.110,00:07:13.060
"So this vector right here must
be perpendicular to n.",00:07:13.060,00:07:20.555
"Perpendicular to our
normal vector.",00:07:23.592,00:07:29.980
"Now, if my normal vector-- let's
say my normal vector n.",00:07:29.980,00:07:36.150
"So this vector is perpendicular
to this guy",00:07:36.150,00:07:38.940
right here.,00:07:38.940,00:07:39.440
"It's perpendicular to the
vector n1, n2, n3.",00:07:39.440,00:07:43.770
"Now using this information, how
can we get to this type of",00:07:43.770,00:07:48.260
"an expression, just this linear
equation of x, y and z?",00:07:48.260,00:07:52.730
"Well, we know that n-- let me
switch to a neutral color.",00:07:52.730,00:07:58.680
"We know that n-- actually, I
didn't want to do this caret",00:07:58.680,00:08:01.885
here. n is not a unit vector.,00:08:01.885,00:08:03.950
"But let's say n, so it's
perpendicular to this.",00:08:03.950,00:08:08.170
"So the dot product of it,
we saw that right there.",00:08:08.170,00:08:10.620
"We saw it in the
previous video.",00:08:10.620,00:08:11.600
"The dot product of n with this
vector right here-- actually,",00:08:11.600,00:08:15.640
let me draw it.,00:08:15.640,00:08:16.650
"You know, I already drew the
plane sideways, so I can",00:08:16.650,00:08:18.740
actually draw my n vector.,00:08:18.740,00:08:20.300
"My n vector's going to look
something like this.",00:08:20.300,00:08:22.010
"It's going to be popping
straight out of the plane.",00:08:22.010,00:08:24.130
"And I could shift it over, but
it's always going to be in",00:08:24.130,00:08:26.320
that same direction.,00:08:26.320,00:08:27.030
"It's going to be perpendicular
to this vector right here.",00:08:27.030,00:08:30.300
"So n is perpendicular
to x minus x0.",00:08:30.300,00:08:33.659
"Which means that their dot
product is equal to 0.",00:08:38.450,00:08:42.260
"Well what does x minus
x0 look like?",00:08:42.260,00:08:45.280
"So this is going to look
like this expression.",00:08:45.280,00:08:48.240
"If I write out the vectors
themselves it's the vector n1,",00:08:48.240,00:08:53.090
"n2, n3 being dotted with-- well,
if I take x minus x0,",00:08:53.090,00:09:00.570
"that's just the scalar x
minus the scalar x0.",00:09:00.570,00:09:04.980
The first term subtracted.,00:09:04.980,00:09:06.740
"And then the scalar y
minus the scalar y0.",00:09:06.740,00:09:10.950
"And then the scalar z
minus the scalar z0.",00:09:10.950,00:09:14.920
"We know that this whole thing
has to be equal to 0 because",00:09:14.920,00:09:17.540
they're perpendicular.,00:09:17.540,00:09:18.880
"And then if we take the dot
product here, we get n1 times",00:09:18.880,00:09:25.756
"x minus x0 plus n2 times y minus
y0 plus n3 times z minus",00:09:25.756,00:09:34.130
z0 is equal to 0.,00:09:34.130,00:09:37.510
"And you might not completely
recognize it, but this is--",00:09:37.510,00:09:40.420
"you'll have to do a little
algebra to clean it up-- but",00:09:40.420,00:09:42.960
"this is the form ax plus by
plus cz is equal to d.",00:09:42.960,00:09:52.160
"And actually, I think I
made a mistake here.",00:09:52.160,00:09:53.570
"This should be not 0,
this is equal to d.",00:09:53.570,00:09:58.110
"This is the general form
for a plane in R3.",00:09:58.110,00:10:03.160
"A plane is just a linear
surface in R3.",00:10:03.160,00:10:05.070
"I shouldn't have written
a 0 there.",00:10:05.070,00:10:06.770
So this does take this form.,00:10:06.770,00:10:09.570
"And if you don't believe
me, we can do it",00:10:09.570,00:10:11.360
with an actual example.,00:10:11.360,00:10:13.020
"So let's say we have--
I gave you my",00:10:13.020,00:10:16.080
normal-- I specify a plane.,00:10:16.080,00:10:17.590
"If I give you a normal vector
and I tell you that normal",00:10:17.590,00:10:20.420
"vector is the point 1, 3, minus
2 and I say that it",00:10:20.420,00:10:25.110
"intersects the point, or a point
that lies on the plane--",00:10:25.110,00:10:30.840
"The normal vector and the point
don't necessarily have",00:10:30.840,00:10:33.060
to intersect.,00:10:33.060,00:10:34.140
"But let's say for a point that
lies on the plane, I have the",00:10:34.140,00:10:36.920
"point 1, 2 and 3.",00:10:36.920,00:10:39.380
"And I say give me the equation
for this plane.",00:10:39.380,00:10:42.920
"Well, I would say well, if I
take any other point on that",00:10:42.920,00:10:46.430
"plane-- so if I take any other
point on that plane, xyz and",00:10:46.430,00:10:52.115
"it's specified by this vector,
the vector that's defined by",00:10:52.115,00:10:56.110
"the difference between
these two is going",00:10:56.110,00:10:58.190
to lie on the plane.,00:10:58.190,00:10:59.840
"This point and this point
lie on the plane, so the",00:10:59.840,00:11:03.270
"difference between these two
vectors, the whole vector will",00:11:03.270,00:11:05.870
lie on the plane.,00:11:05.870,00:11:08.190
Let me take the difference.,00:11:08.190,00:11:09.180
"So x minus x0 is equal to x
minus 1, y minus 2, and",00:11:09.180,00:11:22.530
then z minus 3.,00:11:22.530,00:11:25.310
"I'm saying this will
lie on the plane.",00:11:25.310,00:11:29.320
This is on the plane.,00:11:29.320,00:11:32.800
"And it's going to
be perpendicular",00:11:32.800,00:11:34.230
to our normal vector.,00:11:34.230,00:11:35.480
"So if I dot my normal vector, 1,
3, minus 2, with this thing",00:11:37.760,00:11:44.590
"right here, with x minus 1,
y minus 2, z minus 3,",00:11:44.590,00:11:51.000
I should get 0.,00:11:51.000,00:11:52.660
"Because this has to be
perpendicular to anything that",00:11:52.660,00:11:54.910
lies on the plane.,00:11:54.910,00:11:56.710
So what do we get?,00:11:56.710,00:11:57.320
"We get 1 times x minus
1 is x minus 1.",00:11:57.320,00:12:00.990
Plus 3 times y minus 2.,00:12:00.990,00:12:04.710
Just taking the dot product.,00:12:04.710,00:12:06.010
"Minus 2 times z minus
3 is equal to 0.",00:12:06.010,00:12:11.050
"Let's if we can do a little bit
of algebra here to clean",00:12:11.050,00:12:14.380
this up a little bit.,00:12:14.380,00:12:15.720
"I get x minus 1 plus 3y
minus 6 minus 2z plus",00:12:15.720,00:12:24.920
6 is equal to 0.,00:12:24.920,00:12:28.870
And let's see.,00:12:28.870,00:12:29.400
"Minus 6 and a plus
6 cancel out.",00:12:29.400,00:12:32.200
"And then I can take
this minus 1.",00:12:32.200,00:12:34.380
"I could add 1 to both sides and
I get x plus 3y minus 2z--",00:12:34.380,00:12:41.540
"add that 1 to both sidess--
is equal to 1.",00:12:41.540,00:12:44.300
And there you have it.,00:12:44.300,00:12:45.750
"Just by using the simple fact
that this is a point on the",00:12:45.750,00:12:49.330
"plane and this is a normal
vector, I was able to use the",00:12:49.330,00:12:51.720
"idea that this has to be normal
or its dot product with",00:12:51.720,00:12:54.930
"any point, with any vector that
lies on the plane, I was",00:12:54.930,00:12:58.130
able to get this right here.,00:12:58.130,00:13:00.570
"I didn't have to go
through this whole",00:13:00.570,00:13:02.000
business right here.,00:13:02.000,00:13:02.700
"You could have just used this
formula right here.",00:13:02.700,00:13:05.450
"You could have just said n1
is 1 times x minus x1.",00:13:05.450,00:13:11.370
Or x0 I could call it.,00:13:11.370,00:13:13.180
"So x minus this 1 plus n2, 3
times y minus 2 plus minus 2",00:13:13.180,00:13:23.260
times z minus 3 is equal to 0.,00:13:23.260,00:13:28.070
"And then if you just did
a little bit of math.",00:13:28.070,00:13:29.700
"a little bit of algebra, you
would've gotten there.",00:13:29.700,00:13:32.130
"So hopefully find this
reasonable useful.",00:13:32.130,00:13:34.150
"This is actually quite useful
if you ever have to do",00:13:34.150,00:13:37.230
"anything that involves any
type of three-dimensional",00:13:37.230,00:13:40.660
mathematics.,00:13:40.660,00:13:41.520
"And if you ever become a game
programmer this would be--",00:13:41.520,00:13:44.970
"there's thousands of
other applications.",00:13:44.970,00:13:46.540
"But this is kind of a useful
byproduct of some of the",00:13:46.540,00:13:49.680
"formal mathematics that
we've been doing.",00:13:49.680,00:13:52.740
