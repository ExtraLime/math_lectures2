"Let's see if we can prove to
ourselves some more reasonably",00:00:00.470,00:00:03.890
"interesting transpose
properties.",00:00:03.890,00:00:06.415
"So let's define some matrix C,
that's equal to the sum of two",00:00:06.415,00:00:10.660
"other matrices, A and B.",00:00:10.660,00:00:14.280
"And so any entry in C, I can
denote with a lowercase cij.",00:00:14.280,00:00:19.040
"So if I want the ith row in jth
column it would be cij,",00:00:19.040,00:00:22.830
"and so each of its entries are
going to be the sum of the",00:00:22.830,00:00:25.880
"corresponding columns that
are matrices A and B.",00:00:25.880,00:00:28.300
"So our ij entry in C is going to
be equal to the ij entry in",00:00:28.300,00:00:33.140
"A, plus the ij entry in B.",00:00:33.140,00:00:36.450
"That's our definition
of matrix addition.",00:00:36.450,00:00:38.470
"You just get the corresponding
entry in the same row and",00:00:38.470,00:00:40.710
"column, add them up, and you get
your entry in the same row",00:00:40.710,00:00:44.130
"and column, and your new
matrix is the sum",00:00:44.130,00:00:46.400
of the other two.,00:00:46.400,00:00:48.140
"Now, let's think a little bit
about the transposes of these",00:00:48.140,00:00:52.610
guys right here.,00:00:52.610,00:00:53.790
"So, if A looks like this.",00:00:53.790,00:00:59.130
"I won't draw all
of the entries.",00:00:59.130,00:01:00.310
It takes forever.,00:01:00.310,00:01:01.540
"But each of its entries are
ij, just like that.",00:01:01.540,00:01:06.100
"Let's say that A transpose
looks like this.",00:01:06.100,00:01:08.210
"Each of its entries, we would
call it, that's if you've got",00:01:08.210,00:01:12.230
"that same entry, we're going
to call it a-prime ij.",00:01:12.230,00:01:15.790
"And these things aren't probably
going to be the same.",00:01:15.790,00:01:18.220
"There's some chance they are,
but they're probably not going",00:01:18.220,00:01:20.350
to be the same.,00:01:20.350,00:01:21.650
But that its ijth entry.,00:01:21.650,00:01:23.810
"In the ith row, jth column.",00:01:23.810,00:01:25.930
In A transpose.,00:01:25.930,00:01:27.490
"Now, the fact that this is the
transpose of that means that",00:01:27.490,00:01:29.900
"everything that's in some row
and column here is going to be",00:01:29.900,00:01:32.800
"in that column and row over
here, that the rows and",00:01:32.800,00:01:35.160
columns get switched.,00:01:35.160,00:01:36.580
"So we know that we could write
that a-prime ij, we're going",00:01:36.580,00:01:43.330
"to have the same entry
that was in aji.",00:01:43.330,00:01:49.560
"Maybe aji is over here.
aji is over here.",00:01:49.560,00:01:53.220
"So, this thing over here, which
is in the same position",00:01:53.220,00:01:56.230
"as this one, is going to be
equal to this guy over here if",00:01:56.230,00:01:58.940
"you switched the rows
and columns.",00:01:58.940,00:02:00.820
I think you can accept that.,00:02:00.820,00:02:02.060
"And you can make the same
argument for B.",00:02:02.060,00:02:04.630
Let me actually draw it out.,00:02:04.630,00:02:05.820
So if I make B transpose.,00:02:05.820,00:02:07.070
"The entry in the ith row and
jth column, I'll call it",00:02:09.949,00:02:12.960
b-prime ij.,00:02:12.960,00:02:15.380
Just like that.,00:02:15.380,00:02:16.090
Just like I did for A.,00:02:16.090,00:02:18.450
"So we could say that b-prime ij
is equal to, you take the",00:02:18.450,00:02:24.750
"matrix B, what's going to be
the entry that's in the jth",00:02:24.750,00:02:28.300
row and ith column.,00:02:28.300,00:02:29.920
"These are, you could
almost say, the",00:02:29.920,00:02:31.290
definition of the transpose.,00:02:31.290,00:02:33.060
"If I'm in the third row and
second column now, it's going",00:02:33.060,00:02:35.910
"to be what was in the second
row and third column.",00:02:35.910,00:02:39.970
Fair enough.,00:02:39.970,00:02:40.790
"So we already have what
cij is equal to.",00:02:40.790,00:02:44.980
"What's the transpose of cij
going to be equal to?",00:02:44.980,00:02:48.610
Let me write that down.,00:02:48.610,00:02:50.850
"So C transpose, let me
write it over here.",00:02:50.850,00:02:55.370
Write C transpose is equal to.,00:02:55.370,00:02:58.620
I'll use the same notation.,00:02:58.620,00:02:59.780
"The prime means that
we're taking",00:02:59.780,00:03:01.100
entries in the transpose.,00:03:01.100,00:03:03.380
"So C transpose is just going to
be a bunch of entries, ij.",00:03:03.380,00:03:06.970
"And I'll put a little prime
there showing that that's",00:03:06.970,00:03:10.105
"entries in the matrix
of the transpose,",00:03:10.105,00:03:13.440
and not in C itself.,00:03:13.440,00:03:15.620
"And we know that c-prime
ij is equal to cji.",00:03:15.620,00:03:23.440
Nothing new at all.,00:03:23.440,00:03:24.430
"We've just expressed kind
of the definition of the",00:03:24.430,00:03:26.480
"transpose for these
three matrices.",00:03:26.480,00:03:28.970
Now what is cji equal to?,00:03:28.970,00:03:32.230
"So let's focus on this
a little bit.",00:03:32.230,00:03:34.220
What is cji equal to?,00:03:34.220,00:03:36.100
"We know that cij is equal to a
sub ij plus b sub ij, so if",00:03:36.100,00:03:40.480
"you swap them around, this is
going to be equal to, you just",00:03:40.480,00:03:43.320
swap the j's and the i's.,00:03:43.320,00:03:45.050
a sub ji plus b sub ji.,00:03:45.050,00:03:48.990
"I just used this information
here-- you could almost view",00:03:48.990,00:03:51.280
"it as this assumption or
this definition-- to go",00:03:51.280,00:03:53.420
from this to this.,00:03:53.420,00:03:54.370
"If I had an x and a y here, I'd
have an x and a y here,",00:03:54.370,00:03:57.480
and a x and a y here.,00:03:57.480,00:03:58.860
"I have a j and an i here, so I
have a j and an i there, and a",00:03:58.860,00:04:02.640
j and an i right there.,00:04:02.640,00:04:04.880
Now what are these?,00:04:04.880,00:04:06.740
What are these equal to?,00:04:06.740,00:04:08.620
This is equal to.,00:04:08.620,00:04:09.870
"This guy right here is equal
to-- we do it in the green--",00:04:13.310,00:04:18.829
"the same entry for the
transpose of a at ij.",00:04:18.829,00:04:26.560
"And this is equal to the
same entry for the",00:04:26.560,00:04:28.800
transpose of b at ij.,00:04:28.800,00:04:31.330
"Now, what is this telling us?",00:04:36.090,00:04:39.020
"It's telling us that the
transpose of C, which is the",00:04:39.020,00:04:42.030
"same thing is A plus B, so it's
saying that A plus B, A",00:04:42.030,00:04:46.660
"plus B transpose is the same
thing as C transpose.",00:04:46.660,00:04:51.050
Let me write that.,00:04:51.050,00:04:52.320
"C transpose is the same thing
as A plus B transpose.",00:04:52.320,00:04:55.350
"So these are the entries in A
plus B transpose right here.",00:04:55.350,00:04:59.030
And what is this over here?,00:04:59.030,00:05:00.410
What are these?,00:05:00.410,00:05:01.670
"These are the entries
right there.",00:05:01.670,00:05:03.740
"We do the equal sign
over here.",00:05:03.740,00:05:06.260
What are these?,00:05:06.260,00:05:07.320
"These are the entries in A
transpose plus B transpose.",00:05:07.320,00:05:13.370
Right?,00:05:13.370,00:05:14.490
"These are the entries
in A transpose.",00:05:14.490,00:05:15.600
"These are the entries
in B transpose.",00:05:15.600,00:05:17.620
"If you take the sum of the two,
you're just adding up the",00:05:17.620,00:05:20.150
corresponding entries.,00:05:20.150,00:05:21.000
"So that's straightforward to
show that if you take the sum",00:05:21.000,00:05:23.870
"of two matrices and then
transpose it, it's equivalent",00:05:23.870,00:05:26.610
"to transposing them first, and
then taking their sum.",00:05:26.610,00:05:30.540
"Which is a reasonably
neat outcome.",00:05:30.540,00:05:33.920
"Let's do one more and I think
we'll finish up all of our",00:05:33.920,00:05:36.510
major transpose properties.,00:05:36.510,00:05:39.190
"Let's say that A inverse-- this
is going to be a slightly",00:05:39.190,00:05:42.360
different take on things.,00:05:42.360,00:05:43.380
"We're still going to
take the transpose.",00:05:43.380,00:05:45.130
"So if we know that A inverse
is the inverse of A, that",00:05:45.130,00:05:51.760
"means that A times A inverse
is equal to the identity",00:05:51.760,00:05:58.410
"matrix, assuming that these
are n-by-n matrices.",00:05:58.410,00:06:01.360
"So it's the n-dimensional
identity matrix.",00:06:01.360,00:06:04.430
"And that A inverse times A is
also going to be equal to the",00:06:04.430,00:06:10.730
identity matrix.,00:06:10.730,00:06:12.250
"Now, let's take the
transpose of both",00:06:12.250,00:06:14.790
sides of this equation.,00:06:14.790,00:06:16.990
"I'll do them both
simultaneously.",00:06:16.990,00:06:18.910
"So if you take the transpose of
both sides of the equation,",00:06:18.910,00:06:21.540
"you get A times A inverse
transpose is equal to the",00:06:21.540,00:06:26.880
identity matrix transpose.,00:06:26.880,00:06:28.950
"And what's the transpose
of the identity matrix?",00:06:28.950,00:06:31.560
Let's draw it out.,00:06:31.560,00:06:33.180
"The identity matrix
looks like this.",00:06:33.180,00:06:34.490
"You have just ones all the
way down the diagonal and",00:06:34.490,00:06:37.800
everything else is 0.,00:06:37.800,00:06:39.050
"Right, and you could view this
as i 1, 1 i 2, 2 all the way",00:06:41.870,00:06:45.480
"down to i n, n.",00:06:45.480,00:06:46.710
Everything else is 0.,00:06:46.710,00:06:48.285
"So when you take the transpose,
you're just",00:06:48.285,00:06:50.040
"swapping out the
zeroes, right?",00:06:50.040,00:06:52.430
These guys don't change.,00:06:52.430,00:06:53.800
"The diagonal does not change
when you take the transpose.",00:06:53.800,00:06:57.090
"So the transpose of the identity
matrix is equal to",00:06:57.090,00:06:59.570
the identity matrix.,00:06:59.570,00:07:00.820
"And so we can apply that
same thing here.",00:07:02.890,00:07:04.490
"Let's take the transpose
for this statement.",00:07:04.490,00:07:07.750
"So we know that A inverse times
A transpose is equal to",00:07:07.750,00:07:12.870
"the identity matrix transpose,
which is equal to",00:07:12.870,00:07:15.090
the identity matrix.,00:07:15.090,00:07:16.960
"And then we know what happens
when you take the",00:07:16.960,00:07:18.610
transpose of a product.,00:07:18.610,00:07:19.960
"It's equal to the
product of the",00:07:19.960,00:07:21.190
transposes in reverse order.,00:07:21.190,00:07:23.720
"So this thing right here we
can rewrite as A inverse",00:07:23.720,00:07:28.050
"transpose times A transpose,
which is going to be equal to",00:07:28.050,00:07:32.450
the identity matrix.,00:07:32.450,00:07:33.540
"You could do the same
thing over here.",00:07:33.540,00:07:35.550
"This thing is going to be equal
to A transpose times A",00:07:35.550,00:07:39.930
"inverse transpose, which is also
going to be equal to the",00:07:39.930,00:07:44.310
identity matrix.,00:07:44.310,00:07:45.880
"Now, this is an interesting
statement.",00:07:45.880,00:07:48.830
"The fact that, if I have this
guy right here, times the",00:07:48.830,00:07:55.340
"transpose of A is equal to the
identity matrix, and the",00:07:55.340,00:07:57.510
"transpose of A times that same
guy is equal to identity",00:07:57.510,00:08:00.885
"matrix, implies that A inverse
transpose is the",00:08:00.885,00:08:11.650
inverse of A transpose.,00:08:11.650,00:08:16.150
"Or another way of writing that
is if I take A transpose, and",00:08:16.150,00:08:19.800
"if I take its inverse, that is
going to be equal to this guy.",00:08:19.800,00:08:24.510
"It's going to be equal to
A inverse transpose.",00:08:24.510,00:08:27.925
"So, another neat outcome dealing
with transposes.",00:08:27.925,00:08:31.840
"If you take the inverse of the
transpose, it's the same thing",00:08:31.840,00:08:35.760
"as the transpose
of the inverse.",00:08:35.760,00:08:39.159
