"Let's say that I have
two nonzero vectors.",00:00:00.840,00:00:03.270
"Let's say the first vector is
x, the second vector is y.",00:00:03.270,00:00:07.005
"They're both in the set Rn
and they're nonzero.",00:00:09.920,00:00:13.270
"It turns out that the absolute
value of their-- let me do it",00:00:17.450,00:00:22.133
in a different color.,00:00:22.133,00:00:25.320
This color's nice.,00:00:25.320,00:00:26.800
"The absolute value of their
dot product of the two",00:00:26.800,00:00:31.080
"vectors-- and remember, this is
just a scalar quantity-- is",00:00:31.080,00:00:35.280
"less than or equal to the
product of their lengths.",00:00:35.280,00:00:40.840
"And we've defined the dot
product and we've defined",00:00:40.840,00:00:43.140
lengths already.,00:00:43.140,00:00:44.230
"It's less than or equal to the
product of their lengths and",00:00:44.230,00:00:47.390
"just to push it even further,
the only time that this is",00:00:47.390,00:00:50.730
"equal, so the dot product of the
two vectors is only going",00:00:50.730,00:00:57.930
"to be equal to the lengths of
this-- the equal and the less",00:00:57.930,00:01:01.575
"than or equal apply only in the
situation-- let me write",00:01:01.575,00:01:05.470
"that down-- where one of these
vectors is a scalar multiple",00:01:05.470,00:01:11.460
of the other.,00:01:11.460,00:01:11.920
Or they're collinear.,00:01:11.920,00:01:13.580
"You know, one's just kind of the
longer or shorter version",00:01:13.580,00:01:16.430
of the other one.,00:01:16.430,00:01:17.530
"So only in the situation where
let's just say x is equal to",00:01:17.530,00:01:22.250
some scalar multiple of y.,00:01:22.250,00:01:24.875
"These inequalities or I guess
the equality of this",00:01:27.970,00:01:30.760
"inequality, this is called the
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality.",00:01:30.760,00:01:33.215
"So let's prove it because you
can't take something like this",00:01:43.200,00:01:45.580
just at face value.,00:01:45.580,00:01:46.680
"You shouldn't just
accept that.",00:01:46.680,00:01:49.040
"So let me just construct a
somewhat artificial function.",00:01:49.040,00:01:53.280
"Let me construct some function
of-- that's a function of some",00:01:53.280,00:01:58.180
"variables, some scalar t.",00:01:58.180,00:02:00.410
"Let me define p of t to be equal
to the length of the",00:02:00.410,00:02:04.710
"vector t times the vector-- some
scalar t times the vector",00:02:04.710,00:02:12.420
y minus the vector x.,00:02:12.420,00:02:15.880
"It's the length of
this vector.",00:02:15.880,00:02:17.300
"This is going to be
a vector now.",00:02:17.300,00:02:19.320
That squared.,00:02:19.320,00:02:20.920
"Now before I move forward
I want to make one",00:02:20.920,00:02:23.130
little point here.,00:02:23.130,00:02:23.790
"If I take the length of any
vector, I'll do it here.",00:02:23.790,00:02:29.740
"Let's say I take the length
of some vector v.",00:02:29.740,00:02:32.890
"I want you to accept that this
is going to be a positive",00:02:32.890,00:02:36.820
"number, or it's at least greater
than or equal to 0.",00:02:36.820,00:02:39.150
"Because this is just going to be
each of its terms squared.",00:02:39.150,00:02:42.940
"v2 squared all the way
to vn squared.",00:02:42.940,00:02:45.340
All of these are real numbers.,00:02:45.340,00:02:46.640
"When you square a real number,
you get something greater than",00:02:46.640,00:02:49.550
or equal to 0.,00:02:49.550,00:02:50.770
"When you sum them up, you're
going to have something",00:02:50.770,00:02:52.290
greater than or equal to 0.,00:02:52.290,00:02:53.670
"And you take the square root
of it, the principal square",00:02:53.670,00:02:55.840
"root, the positive square root,
you're going to have",00:02:55.840,00:02:57.370
"something greater than
or equal to 0.",00:02:57.370,00:02:59.270
"So the length of any real vector
is going to be greater",00:02:59.270,00:03:02.930
than or equal to 0.,00:03:02.930,00:03:04.180
"So this is the length
of a real vector.",00:03:04.180,00:03:06.690
"So this is going to be greater
than or equal to 0.",00:03:06.690,00:03:11.230
"Now, in the previous video, I
think it was two videos ago, I",00:03:11.230,00:03:14.400
"also showed that the magnitude
or the length of a vector",00:03:14.400,00:03:18.860
"squared can also be rewritten
as the dot product of that",00:03:18.860,00:03:22.950
vector with itself.,00:03:22.950,00:03:24.570
"So let's rewrite this
vector that way.",00:03:24.570,00:03:26.830
"The length of this vector
squared is equal to the dot",00:03:29.920,00:03:32.750
"product of that vector
with itself.",00:03:32.750,00:03:34.230
"So it's ty minus x
dot ty minus x.",00:03:34.230,00:03:44.880
"In the last video, I showed
you that you can treat a",00:03:44.880,00:03:49.120
"multiplication or you can treat
the dot product very",00:03:49.120,00:03:52.050
"similar to regular
multiplication when it comes",00:03:52.050,00:03:54.330
"to the associative, distributive
and commutative",00:03:54.330,00:03:57.420
properties.,00:03:57.420,00:03:58.330
"So when you multiplied these,
you know, you could kind of",00:03:58.330,00:04:00.200
"view this as multiplying
these two binomials.",00:04:00.200,00:04:02.340
"You can do it the same way as
you would just multiply two",00:04:02.340,00:04:05.440
regular algebraic binomials.,00:04:05.440,00:04:07.360
"You're essentially just using
the distributive property.",00:04:07.360,00:04:11.030
"But remember, this isn't just
regular multiplication.",00:04:11.030,00:04:13.760
"This is the dot product
we're doing.",00:04:13.760,00:04:15.480
"This is vector multiplication
or one version of vector",00:04:15.480,00:04:18.149
multiplication.,00:04:18.149,00:04:19.220
"So if we distribute it out, this
will become ty dot ty.",00:04:19.220,00:04:24.730
So let me write that out.,00:04:24.730,00:04:25.850
That'll be ty dot ty.,00:04:25.850,00:04:30.850
"And then we'll get a minus--
let me do it this way.",00:04:30.850,00:04:36.430
"Then we get the minus
x times this ty.",00:04:36.430,00:04:42.580
"Instead of saying times,
I should be very",00:04:42.580,00:04:44.640
careful to say dot.,00:04:44.640,00:04:45.720
So minus x dot ty.,00:04:45.720,00:04:52.400
"And then you have this ty
times this minus x.",00:04:52.400,00:04:58.810
"So then you have
minus ty dot x.",00:04:58.810,00:05:04.860
"And then finally, you have the
x's dot with each other.",00:05:04.860,00:05:08.900
"And you can view them as
minus 1x dot minus 1x.",00:05:08.900,00:05:12.680
You could say plus minus 1x.,00:05:12.680,00:05:16.080
"I could just view this as plus
minus 1 or plus minus 1.",00:05:16.080,00:05:21.500
"So this is minus 1x
dot minus 1x.",00:05:21.500,00:05:26.260
So let's see.,00:05:26.260,00:05:26.860
"So this is what my whole
expression simplified to or",00:05:26.860,00:05:29.940
expanded to.,00:05:29.940,00:05:30.710
"I can't really call this
a simplification.",00:05:30.710,00:05:32.890
"But we can use the fact that
this is commutative and",00:05:32.890,00:05:35.410
"associative to rewrite this
expression right here.",00:05:35.410,00:05:38.230
"This is equal to y dot
y times t squared.",00:05:38.230,00:05:45.430
t is just a scalar.,00:05:45.430,00:05:46.680
"Minus-- and actually,
this is 2.",00:05:49.270,00:05:50.750
"These two things
are equivalent.",00:05:50.750,00:05:52.810
"They're just rearrangements of
the same thing and we saw that",00:05:52.810,00:05:55.370
"the dot product is
associative.",00:05:55.370,00:05:57.290
"So this is just equal to 2
times x dot y times t.",00:05:57.290,00:06:06.260
"And I should do that in maybe
a different color.",00:06:06.260,00:06:09.230
"So these two terms result in
that term right there.",00:06:09.230,00:06:13.080
"And then if you just rearrange
these you have a minus 1",00:06:13.080,00:06:16.570
times a minus 1.,00:06:16.570,00:06:17.400
"They cancel out, so those will
become plus and you're just",00:06:17.400,00:06:20.070
left with plus x dot x.,00:06:20.070,00:06:25.140
"And I should do that in a
different color as well.",00:06:25.140,00:06:27.740
"I'll do that in an
orange color.",00:06:27.740,00:06:29.690
"So those terms end up
with that term.",00:06:29.690,00:06:32.820
"Then of course, that term
results in that term.",00:06:32.820,00:06:35.620
"And remember, all I did
is I rewrote this",00:06:35.620,00:06:37.880
"thing and said, look.",00:06:37.880,00:06:38.490
"This has got to be greater
than or equal to 0.",00:06:38.490,00:06:41.990
So I could rewrite that here.,00:06:41.990,00:06:44.620
"This thing is still just
the same thing.",00:06:44.620,00:06:46.070
I've just rewritten it.,00:06:46.070,00:06:47.450
"So this is all going to be
greater than or equal to 0.",00:06:47.450,00:06:52.620
"Now let's make a little bit of
a substitution just to clean",00:06:52.620,00:06:54.990
"up our expression
a little bit.",00:06:54.990,00:06:56.590
"And we'll later back substitute
into this.",00:06:56.590,00:06:59.280
Let's define this as a.,00:06:59.280,00:07:02.480
"Let's define this piece
right here as b.",00:07:02.480,00:07:07.860
"So the whole thing
minus 2x dot y.",00:07:07.860,00:07:10.380
I'll leave the t there.,00:07:10.380,00:07:11.780
"And let's define this or
let me just define this",00:07:11.780,00:07:17.020
right here as c.,00:07:17.020,00:07:17.825
X dot x as c.,00:07:17.825,00:07:20.130
"So then, what does our
expression become?",00:07:20.130,00:07:22.060
"It becomes a times t squared
minus-- I want to be careful",00:07:22.060,00:07:29.910
"with the colors-- b
times t plus c.",00:07:29.910,00:07:35.480
"And of course, we know that it's
going to be greater than",00:07:39.180,00:07:41.050
or equal to 0.,00:07:41.050,00:07:41.780
"It's the same thing as
this up here, greater",00:07:41.780,00:07:43.660
than or equal to 0.,00:07:43.660,00:07:44.270
I could write p of t here.,00:07:44.270,00:07:47.125
"Now this is greater than or
equal to 0 for any t that I",00:07:47.125,00:07:50.890
put in here.,00:07:50.890,00:07:51.530
"For any real t that
I put in there.",00:07:51.530,00:07:53.995
"Let me evaluate our function
at b over 2a.",00:08:00.640,00:08:05.190
"And I can definitely do this
because what was a?",00:08:05.190,00:08:07.570
"I just have to make sure I'm not
dividing by 0 any place.",00:08:07.570,00:08:10.700
"So a was this vector
dotted with itself.",00:08:10.700,00:08:13.850
"And we said this was
a nonzero vector.",00:08:13.850,00:08:16.290
"So this is the square
of its length.",00:08:16.290,00:08:18.680
"It's a nonzero vector, so some
of these terms up here would",00:08:18.680,00:08:21.610
"end up becoming positively
when you take its length.",00:08:21.610,00:08:23.790
"So this thing right
here is nonzero.",00:08:23.790,00:08:25.710
This is a nonzero vector.,00:08:25.710,00:08:27.310
"Then 2 times the dot product
with itself is also going to",00:08:27.310,00:08:30.880
be nonzero.,00:08:30.880,00:08:31.450
So we can do this.,00:08:31.450,00:08:32.309
"We don't worry about dividing
by 0, whatever else.",00:08:32.309,00:08:34.990
"But what will this
be equal to?",00:08:34.990,00:08:37.049
"This'll be equal to-- and I'll
just stick to the green.",00:08:37.049,00:08:39.200
"It takes too long to keep
switching between colors.",00:08:39.200,00:08:42.110
"This is equal to a times this
expression squared.",00:08:42.110,00:08:45.230
"So it's b squared
over 4a squared.",00:08:45.230,00:08:49.340
"I just squared 2a to
get the 4a squared.",00:08:49.340,00:08:52.090
Minus b times this.,00:08:52.090,00:08:55.270
"So b times-- this is just
regular multiplication.",00:08:55.270,00:08:58.760
b times b over 2a.,00:08:58.760,00:09:01.650
"Just write regular
multiplication there.",00:09:01.650,00:09:03.780
Plus c.,00:09:03.780,00:09:05.130
"And we know all of that is
greater than or equal to 0.",00:09:05.130,00:09:07.870
"Now if we simplify this a little
bit, what do we get?",00:09:07.870,00:09:12.080
"Well this a cancels out with
this exponent there and you",00:09:12.080,00:09:15.290
"end up with a b squared
right there.",00:09:15.290,00:09:18.480
"So we get b squared over 4a
minus b squared over 2a.",00:09:18.480,00:09:26.150
That's that term over there.,00:09:26.150,00:09:27.650
"Plus c is greater than
or equal to 0.",00:09:27.650,00:09:31.730
Let me rewrite this.,00:09:31.730,00:09:33.440
"If I multiply the numerator and
denominator of this by 2,",00:09:33.440,00:09:36.810
what do I get?,00:09:36.810,00:09:38.010
I get 2b squared over 4a.,00:09:38.010,00:09:41.110
"And the whole reason I did
that is to get a common",00:09:41.110,00:09:43.050
denominator here.,00:09:43.050,00:09:44.660
So what do you get?,00:09:44.660,00:09:45.670
"You get b squared over 4a minus
2b squared over 4a.",00:09:45.670,00:09:50.050
"So what do these two
terms simplify to?",00:09:50.050,00:09:52.600
"Well the numerator is b squared
minus 2b squared.",00:09:52.600,00:09:54.930
"So that just becomes minus b
squared over 4a plus c is",00:09:54.930,00:10:01.200
greater than or equal to 0.,00:10:01.200,00:10:02.710
"These two terms add up to
this one right here.",00:10:02.710,00:10:06.570
"Now if we add this to both sides
of the equation, we get",00:10:06.570,00:10:11.490
"c is greater than or equal
to b squared over 4a.",00:10:11.490,00:10:16.260
"It was a negative on
the left-hand side.",00:10:16.260,00:10:17.720
"If I add it to both sides it's
going to be a positive on the",00:10:17.720,00:10:19.570
right-hand side.,00:10:19.570,00:10:21.760
"We're approaching something that
looks like an inequality,",00:10:21.760,00:10:24.470
"so let's back substitute our
original substitutions to see",00:10:24.470,00:10:28.380
what we have now.,00:10:28.380,00:10:30.060
"So where was my original
substitutions that I made?",00:10:30.060,00:10:32.660
It was right here.,00:10:32.660,00:10:35.790
"And actually, just to simplify
more, let me multiply both",00:10:35.790,00:10:37.970
sides by 4a.,00:10:37.970,00:10:39.220
"I said a, not only
is it nonzero,",00:10:41.440,00:10:43.020
it's going to be positive.,00:10:43.020,00:10:44.130
"This is the square
of its length.",00:10:44.130,00:10:46.070
"And I already showed you that
the length of any real",00:10:46.070,00:10:49.670
vector's going to be positive.,00:10:49.670,00:10:51.170
"And the reason why I'm taking
great pains to show that a is",00:10:51.170,00:10:53.460
"positive is because if I
multiply both sides of it I",00:10:53.460,00:10:55.510
"don't want to change the
inequality sign.",00:10:55.510,00:10:57.690
"So let me multiply both sides
of this by a before I",00:10:57.690,00:10:59.910
substitute.,00:10:59.910,00:11:00.380
"So we get 4ac is greater than
or equal to b squared.",00:11:00.380,00:11:07.750
There you go.,00:11:07.750,00:11:08.160
"And remember, I took
great pains.",00:11:08.160,00:11:09.890
"I just said a is definitely a
positive number because it is",00:11:09.890,00:11:13.400
"essentially the square of the
length. y dot y is the square",00:11:13.400,00:11:16.830
"of the length of y, and that's
a positive value.",00:11:16.830,00:11:19.450
It has to be positive.,00:11:19.450,00:11:20.320
"We're dealing with
real vectors.",00:11:20.320,00:11:21.970
"Now let's back substitute
this.",00:11:21.970,00:11:24.470
"So 4 times a, 4 times y dot y.",00:11:24.470,00:11:30.030
"y dot y is also-- I might as
well just write it there.",00:11:30.030,00:11:33.420
"y dot y is the same thing as
the magnitude of y squared.",00:11:33.420,00:11:39.470
That's y dot y.,00:11:39.470,00:11:40.490
This is a.,00:11:40.490,00:11:42.760
"y dot y, I showed you that
in the previous video.",00:11:42.760,00:11:45.690
Times c.,00:11:45.690,00:11:46.800
c is x dot x.,00:11:46.800,00:11:49.760
"Well x dot x is the
same thing as the",00:11:49.760,00:11:53.640
length of vector x squared.,00:11:53.640,00:11:56.200
So this was c.,00:11:56.200,00:11:57.420
"So 4 times a times c is going
to be greater than",00:11:57.420,00:12:01.030
or equal to b squared.,00:12:01.030,00:12:03.920
"Now what was b? b was
this thing here.",00:12:03.920,00:12:06.760
"So b squared would be 2
times x dot y squared.",00:12:06.760,00:12:14.610
"So we've gotten to this
result so far.",00:12:14.610,00:12:17.880
"And so what can we
do with this?",00:12:17.880,00:12:19.620
"Oh sorry, and this whole
thing is squared.",00:12:19.620,00:12:21.200
"This whole thing right
here is b.",00:12:21.200,00:12:23.240
"So let's see if we can
simplify this.",00:12:23.240,00:12:25.220
"So we get-- let me switch
to a different color.",00:12:25.220,00:12:27.620
"4 times the length of y squared
times the length of x",00:12:27.620,00:12:34.870
"squared is greater than or equal
to-- if we squared this",00:12:34.870,00:12:37.660
"quantity right here, we
get 4 times x dot y.",00:12:37.660,00:12:46.270
4 times x dot y times x dot y.,00:12:46.270,00:12:54.620
"Actually, even better, let me
just write it like this.",00:12:54.620,00:12:56.510
"Let me just write 4 times
x dot y squared.",00:12:56.510,00:13:01.090
"Now we can divide
both sides by 4.",00:13:01.090,00:13:02.950
"That won't change
our inequality.",00:13:02.950,00:13:04.600
"So that just cancels
out there.",00:13:04.600,00:13:06.250
"And now let's take the
square root of both",00:13:06.250,00:13:08.050
sides of this equation.,00:13:08.050,00:13:09.840
"So the square roots of both
sides of this equation-- these",00:13:09.840,00:13:13.040
"are positive values, so the
square root of this side is",00:13:13.040,00:13:15.380
"the square root of each
of its terms. That's",00:13:15.380,00:13:16.840
just an exponent property.,00:13:16.840,00:13:18.325
"So if you take the square root
of both sides you get the",00:13:18.325,00:13:21.150
"length of y times the length of
x is greater than or equal",00:13:21.150,00:13:28.010
to the square root of this.,00:13:28.010,00:13:29.570
"And we're going to take the
positive square root.",00:13:29.570,00:13:31.650
"We're going to take the positive
square root on both",00:13:31.650,00:13:33.480
sides of this equation.,00:13:33.480,00:13:34.400
"That keeps us from having to
mess with anything on the",00:13:34.400,00:13:36.600
"inequality or anything
like that.",00:13:36.600,00:13:38.260
"So the positive square root is
going to be the absolute value",00:13:38.260,00:13:42.640
of x dot y.,00:13:42.640,00:13:44.370
"And I want to be very careful
to say this is the absolute",00:13:44.370,00:13:46.060
"value because it's possible that
this thing right here is",00:13:46.060,00:13:51.060
a negative value.,00:13:51.060,00:13:51.755
"But when you square it, you want
to be careful that when",00:13:51.755,00:13:55.520
"you take the square root
of it that you",00:13:55.520,00:13:56.710
stay a positive value.,00:13:56.710,00:13:57.960
"Because otherwise when we take
the principal square root, we",00:13:57.960,00:14:02.050
might mess with the inquality.,00:14:02.050,00:14:04.070
"We're taking the positive square
root, which will be--",00:14:04.070,00:14:07.130
"so if you take the absolute
value, you're ensuring that",00:14:07.130,00:14:08.965
it's going to be positive.,00:14:08.965,00:14:10.590
But this is our result.,00:14:10.590,00:14:12.000
"The absolute value of the dot
product of our vectors is less",00:14:12.000,00:14:15.800
"than the product of the
two vectors lengths.",00:14:15.800,00:14:19.510
"So we got our Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality.",00:14:19.510,00:14:21.586
"Now the last thing I said is
look, what happens if x is",00:14:27.600,00:14:36.630
"equal to some scalar
multiple of y?",00:14:36.630,00:14:39.640
"Well in that case, what's
the absolute value?",00:14:39.640,00:14:41.385
The absolute value of x dot y?,00:14:41.385,00:14:45.930
"Well that equals--
that equals what?",00:14:45.930,00:14:48.520
"If we make the substitution that
equals the absolute value",00:14:48.520,00:14:51.080
of c times y.,00:14:51.080,00:14:52.850
"That's just x dot y, which
is equal to just from the",00:14:52.850,00:14:59.160
associative property.,00:14:59.160,00:15:00.730
"It's equal to the absolute value
of c times-- we want to",00:15:00.730,00:15:04.800
"make sure our absolute value,
keep everything positive.",00:15:04.800,00:15:07.910
y dot y.,00:15:07.910,00:15:10.970
"Well this is just equal to c
times the magnitude of y-- the",00:15:10.970,00:15:22.320
length of y squared.,00:15:22.320,00:15:24.210
"Well that just is equal to the
magnitude of c times-- or the",00:15:24.210,00:15:31.260
"absolute value of our scalar
c times our length of y.",00:15:31.260,00:15:34.986
"Well this right here,
I can rewrite this.",00:15:40.000,00:15:44.290
"I mean you can prove this to
yourself if you don't believe",00:15:44.290,00:15:46.610
"it, but this-- we could put the
c inside of the magnitude",00:15:46.610,00:15:49.790
"and that could be a good
exercise for you to prove.",00:15:49.790,00:15:51.630
But it's pretty straightforward.,00:15:51.630,00:15:52.300
"You just do the definition
of length.",00:15:52.300,00:15:54.180
And you multiply it by c.,00:15:54.180,00:15:56.050
"This is equal to the magnitude
of cy times-- let me say the",00:15:56.050,00:16:01.530
"length of cy times
the length of y.",00:16:01.530,00:16:06.600
"I've lost my vector notation
someplace over here.",00:16:06.600,00:16:10.620
There you go.,00:16:10.620,00:16:11.580
"Now, this is x.",00:16:11.580,00:16:13.920
"So this is equal to the length
of x times the length of y.",00:16:13.920,00:16:19.370
"So I showed you kind of
the second part of the",00:16:19.370,00:16:21.360
"Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality that
this is only equal to each",00:16:21.360,00:16:24.650
"other if one of them is a scalar
multiple of the other.",00:16:24.650,00:16:28.510
"If you're a little uncomfortable
with some of",00:16:28.510,00:16:29.540
"these steps I took, it might
be a good exercise to",00:16:29.540,00:16:31.600
actually prove it.,00:16:31.600,00:16:32.370
"For example, to prove that the
absolute value of c times the",00:16:32.370,00:16:35.720
"length of the vector y is
the same thing as the",00:16:35.720,00:16:39.270
length of c times y.,00:16:39.270,00:16:41.890
"Anyway, hopefully you found
this pretty useful.",00:16:41.890,00:16:43.790
"The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
we'll use a lot when we prove",00:16:43.790,00:16:47.180

linear algebra.",00:16:47.180,00:16:49.580

give you a little more",00:16:49.580,00:16:51.250

lot of sense relative to the",00:16:51.250,00:16:53.960
