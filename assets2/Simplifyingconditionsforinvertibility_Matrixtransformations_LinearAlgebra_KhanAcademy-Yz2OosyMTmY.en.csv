"Well the whole premise of the
last series of videos was",00:00:00.000,00:00:03.560
"really just trying to get at
trying to figure out whether",00:00:03.560,00:00:06.610
"some transformation T-- let's
have some transformation that",00:00:06.610,00:00:10.080
"is a mapping from, let's say
it's a mapping from Rn to Rm,",00:00:10.080,00:00:17.040
"--the whole question is,
is T invertible.",00:00:17.040,00:00:19.100
"And we showed several videos
ago that a function, and a",00:00:26.790,00:00:29.110
"transformation is really just a
function, that a function is",00:00:29.110,00:00:31.900
"invertible if it meets
two conditions.",00:00:31.900,00:00:34.400
So invertible.,00:00:34.400,00:00:36.740
"So I don't have to keep writing
the word over again.",00:00:36.740,00:00:38.840
"You have to have
two conditions.",00:00:38.840,00:00:40.010
"It has to be onto or essentially
it has to map to",00:00:40.010,00:00:43.980
"every member of your codomain
and it also has to be",00:00:43.980,00:00:48.210
one-to-one.,00:00:48.210,00:00:50.540
"Another way of saying one-to-one
is that every",00:00:50.540,00:00:53.060
"member of your codomain is
mapped to by at most one",00:00:53.060,00:00:56.960
member of your domain.,00:00:56.960,00:00:58.700
"And we did several videos where
we thought well if we",00:00:58.700,00:01:01.060
"had a transformation, a linear
transformation, that's defined",00:01:01.060,00:01:04.599
"by a matrix, A, where this would
be an m-by-n matrix, we",00:01:04.599,00:01:11.140
"said that this is going to be
met if the rank-- This is only",00:01:11.140,00:01:19.150
"met if the rank of A is equal to
the number of rows in your",00:01:19.150,00:01:24.740
"transformation matrix
is equal to m.",00:01:24.740,00:01:27.710
"And in the last video I just
showed that this is only true",00:01:27.710,00:01:31.100
"if every one of your column
vectors are linearly",00:01:31.100,00:01:34.360
"independent or that they all
are basis vectors for your",00:01:34.360,00:01:37.200
"column space or that the rank
of your matrix it has to be",00:01:37.200,00:01:43.720
equal to n.,00:01:43.720,00:01:45.320
"Now in order for something to
be invertible, in order for",00:01:45.320,00:01:48.600
"the transformation to be
invertible, both of these",00:01:48.600,00:01:51.290
things have to be true.,00:01:51.290,00:01:52.350
"Your rank of A has to be equal
to m and your rank of A has to",00:01:52.350,00:01:55.440
be equal to n.,00:01:55.440,00:01:56.490
"So in order to be invertible,
a couple of",00:01:56.490,00:01:58.050
things have to happen.,00:01:58.050,00:01:59.890
"In order to be invertible your
rank of your transformation",00:01:59.890,00:02:04.340
"matrix has to be equal to m,
which has to be equal to n.",00:02:04.340,00:02:07.660
So m has to be equal to n.,00:02:07.660,00:02:10.340
"So we have an interesting
condition.",00:02:10.340,00:02:11.610
"You have to have a
square matrix.",00:02:11.610,00:02:13.145
Your matrix has to be n-by-n.,00:02:17.180,00:02:20.790
That's what this implies.,00:02:20.790,00:02:22.030
"If both of these are true, then
m has to be equal n and",00:02:22.030,00:02:24.930
"you're dealing with
a square matrix.",00:02:24.930,00:02:26.480
"Even more, you're dealing with
the square matrix where every",00:02:26.480,00:02:29.650
"one of the columns are
linearly independent,",00:02:29.650,00:02:31.760
so this is our A.,00:02:31.760,00:02:34.660
A looks like this.,00:02:34.660,00:02:35.750
"A1, A2, all the way to An.",00:02:35.750,00:02:41.200
"Since the rank of A is equal to
n, and this is of course an",00:02:41.200,00:02:44.140
n-by-n matrix.,00:02:44.140,00:02:45.280
"We just said that this has to
be the case because its rank",00:02:45.280,00:02:50.240
"has to be equal to m, which is
the number of rows, and its",00:02:50.240,00:02:52.470
"rank has to be equal to n,
which is the number of",00:02:52.470,00:02:53.870
"columns, so the rows and columns
have to be the same.",00:02:53.870,00:02:56.780
"But the fact that your rank
is equal to the number of",00:02:56.780,00:02:59.010
"columns, that means that all
of your column vectors are",00:02:59.010,00:03:03.250
"bases for your column space, or
that if you put them into",00:03:03.250,00:03:06.300
"reduced row echelon form, what
are you going to get?",00:03:06.300,00:03:14.500
"Well all of these guys are basis
vectors so they're all",00:03:14.500,00:03:17.130
"going to be associated with
pivot vectors or they're all",00:03:17.130,00:03:20.780
"going to be associated
with pivot columns.",00:03:20.780,00:03:22.500
"So this is going to be 1, 0,
bunch of 0's, and then you're",00:03:22.500,00:03:26.570
"going to have a 0, 1, a bunch
of 0's like this.",00:03:26.570,00:03:29.180
"They're all going to be
associated with pivot columns",00:03:29.180,00:03:40.690
"when you go into reduced
row echelon form.",00:03:40.690,00:03:43.610
"So all of them are
pivot columns.",00:03:43.610,00:03:45.090
It's an n-by-n matrix.,00:03:45.090,00:03:46.890
"So what is an n-by-n
matrix where every",00:03:46.890,00:03:49.470
column is a pivot column?,00:03:49.470,00:03:51.570
What is an n-by-n matrix?,00:03:51.570,00:03:53.120
Let me write this.,00:03:53.120,00:03:54.870
So you have an n.,00:03:54.870,00:03:55.970
"So the reduced row echelon form
of A has to be equal to",00:03:55.970,00:04:02.710
"an n-by-n matrix, cause A is
n-by-n, where every column is",00:04:02.710,00:04:15.350
"a linearly independent
pivot column.",00:04:15.350,00:04:17.510
"And I mean by definition of
reduced row echelon form you",00:04:17.510,00:04:20.870
"can't have the same pivot
column twice where every",00:04:20.870,00:04:23.570
"column is a linearly independent
pivot column.",00:04:23.570,00:04:28.460
"It's a little bit redundant, but
I think you get the idea.",00:04:28.460,00:04:30.450
"So what is an n-by-n matrix
where every column is a",00:04:30.450,00:04:33.550
"linearly independent
pivot column?",00:04:33.550,00:04:35.560
"Well that is just a matrix that
has 1's down the diagonal",00:04:35.560,00:04:42.960
and everything else is a 0.,00:04:42.960,00:04:44.215
"Or, you've seen this matrix
before, this is just an n-by-n",00:04:46.890,00:04:50.940
"identity matrix or the identity
matrix on n or on Rn.",00:04:50.940,00:04:56.410
"So if you multiply this matrix
times any member of Rn, you're",00:04:56.410,00:04:58.965
"just going to get that
matrix again.",00:04:58.965,00:05:01.350
But this is interesting.,00:05:01.350,00:05:02.740
"We now have a pretty usable
condition for invertibility.",00:05:02.740,00:05:06.440
"We can say that the
transformation T that is a",00:05:06.440,00:05:12.360
"mapping from Rn to-- well it
has to map to the same",00:05:12.360,00:05:17.800
"dimension space so
from Rn to Rn.",00:05:17.800,00:05:21.300
"It's equal to some square matrix
n-by-n, it has to be an",00:05:21.300,00:05:27.720
"n-by-n matrix, times our
vectors in our domain.",00:05:27.720,00:05:31.030
"And it's only going to be
invertible if the reduced row",00:05:31.030,00:05:41.690
"echelon form of our
transformation matrix is equal",00:05:41.690,00:05:47.550
to the identity matrix on n.,00:05:47.550,00:05:50.620
"I mean I could have written an
m here and I could've said",00:05:50.620,00:05:54.590
"this is an m-by-n matrix, but
the only way that this is",00:05:54.590,00:05:58.160
"going to be true is if
this is also an n and",00:05:58.160,00:06:01.700
this is also an m.,00:06:01.700,00:06:02.670
"But maybe I could leave
them there.",00:06:02.670,00:06:03.900
"Let me leave those
m's there because",00:06:03.900,00:06:06.080
that's the big takeaway.,00:06:06.080,00:06:07.700
"The big takeaway is that in
order for the transformation",00:06:07.700,00:06:11.990
"matrix to be invertible, the
only way it's invertible is if",00:06:11.990,00:06:16.330
"the reduced row echelon form of
our transformation matrix",00:06:16.330,00:06:20.640
"is equal to an n-by-n
identity matrix.",00:06:20.640,00:06:23.870
"The identity matrix is always
going to be n-by-n.",00:06:23.870,00:06:27.410
So that's a big takeaway.,00:06:27.410,00:06:28.510
"Now we'll use that in the future
to actually solve for",00:06:28.510,00:06:31.880
"transformations or solve for
inverses of transformations.",00:06:31.880,00:06:34.620
