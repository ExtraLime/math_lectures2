"- [Voiceover] Let's think
about another scenario",00:00:00.213,00:00:01.782
"that we can model with the
differential equations.",00:00:01.782,00:00:03.849
This is a scenario where we take an object,00:00:04.452,00:00:07.271
"that is hotter or cooler than
the ambient room temperature,",00:00:07.271,00:00:10.996
"and we want to model how
fast it cools or heats up.",00:00:10.996,00:00:15.871
And the way that we'll think about it is,00:00:15.871,00:00:18.507
the way that Newton thought about it.,00:00:18.507,00:00:20.206
"And it is described as
Newton's Law of Cooling.",00:00:20.206,00:00:25.206
"And in a lot of ways, it's common sense.",00:00:28.023,00:00:30.778
"It states that the rate
of change of temperature",00:00:30.778,00:00:34.902
"should be proportional
to the difference between",00:00:34.902,00:00:38.126
"the temperature of the object
and the ambient temperature.",00:00:38.126,00:00:42.139
"So let me write that
in mathematical terms.",00:00:42.139,00:00:44.272
"So Newton's Law of Cooling tells us,",00:00:44.272,00:00:46.064
"that the rate of change of temperature,",00:00:46.064,00:00:48.119
"I'll use that with a capital T,",00:00:48.614,00:00:50.157
"with respect to time, lower case t,",00:00:50.157,00:00:53.851
should be proportional to the difference,00:00:53.851,00:00:56.809
between the temperature of the object,00:00:56.809,00:00:59.795
and the ambient temperature.,00:00:59.795,00:01:02.053
"So that is a mathematical
description of it.",00:01:02.053,00:01:04.197
"And once again, it's common sense.",00:01:04.197,00:01:05.318
"If something is much, much hotter",00:01:05.318,00:01:08.209
"than the ambient temperature,
the rate of change",00:01:08.209,00:01:10.216
"should be pretty steep, it should be",00:01:10.279,00:01:11.753
declining in temperature quickly.,00:01:11.753,00:01:13.499
"If something is much, much cooler,",00:01:13.499,00:01:15.786
"it should be increasing
in temperature quickly.",00:01:15.786,00:01:19.427
"And if something is
close, if these two things",00:01:19.427,00:01:22.743
"are pretty close, well
maybe this rate of change",00:01:22.743,00:01:24.747
shouldn't be so big.,00:01:24.783,00:01:26.329
Now I know one thing that you're thinking.,00:01:26.329,00:01:27.683
"You're like, okay, if
the temperature is hotter",00:01:27.683,00:01:32.683
"than the ambient temperature,
then I should be cooling.",00:01:32.805,00:01:36.184
My temperature should be decreasing.,00:01:36.184,00:01:38.969
And a decreasing temperature would imply,00:01:38.969,00:01:41.117
a negative instantaneous change.,00:01:41.117,00:01:43.764
So how will this be a negative value,00:01:43.764,00:01:46.920
"in the case where our
temperature of our object is",00:01:46.092,00:01:48.693
greater than our ambient temperature?,00:01:49.521,00:01:51.716
"And the way that that would happen is,",00:01:51.716,00:01:53.167
you would have to have a negative k.,00:01:53.167,00:01:55.225
"If you don't like thinking
in terms of a negative k,",00:01:55.225,00:01:57.830
"you can just put a
negative right over here",00:01:57.083,00:01:59.089
and now you would have a positive k.,00:01:59.089,00:02:01.861
Now it makes sense.,00:02:02.662,00:02:04.258
"If our thing is hotter, if
it has a higher temperature",00:02:04.258,00:02:07.075
"than the ambient temperature,
so this is a positive,",00:02:07.075,00:02:10.139
"then our rate of change will be negative,",00:02:10.139,00:02:11.792
will be getting cooler.,00:02:11.792,00:02:12.740
"If it was the other way around, if our",00:02:12.074,00:02:14.307
"temperature of our
object is cooler than our",00:02:14.973,00:02:16.881
"ambient temperature, then this thing",00:02:16.881,00:02:18.557
"is going to be a negative,
and then the negative of that",00:02:18.557,00:02:21.132
"is going to be a positive,
we're assuming a positive k,",00:02:21.132,00:02:23.915
and our temperature will be increasing.,00:02:23.915,00:02:26.847
"So hopefully, this makes
some intuitive sense.",00:02:26.847,00:02:30.204
And our constant k could depend on,00:02:30.204,00:02:32.470
"the specific heat of the
object, how much surface area",00:02:32.047,00:02:34.103
"is exposed to it, or whatever else.",00:02:35.003,00:02:37.276
"But now I'm given this,
let's see if we can solve",00:02:37.303,00:02:40.080
"this differential equation
for a general solution.",00:02:40.008,00:02:42.344
"And I encourage you to pause
this video and do that,",00:02:42.416,00:02:44.487
and I will give you a clue.,00:02:44.487,00:02:46.196
This is a separable differential equation.,00:02:46.196,00:02:49.879
"So I assume you've had a go at it,",00:02:50.903,00:02:53.295
so let's now work through it together.,00:02:53.295,00:02:55.327
"So, we just have to
algebraically manipulate this",00:02:55.327,00:02:59.602
so all my Ts and dTs are on one side.,00:02:59.602,00:03:03.387
"I should say, so all my capital
Ts and dTs are on one side,",00:03:03.387,00:03:07.566
"this is going to be a
little bit more confusing",00:03:07.566,00:03:09.222
"because I have a capital
T and a lower case t.",00:03:09.222,00:03:10.293
"Capital T for temperature,
lower case t for time.",00:03:10.932,00:03:13.316
"But hopefully we'll be
able to work through it.",00:03:13.316,00:03:14.743
"And then I'm going to have
all my time differentials",00:03:14.743,00:03:17.251
and time variables on the other side.,00:03:17.251,00:03:19.423
"So one thing I could is
I could divide both sides",00:03:19.423,00:03:21.357
"by T minus ambient
temperature, minus T sub a.",00:03:21.357,00:03:25.513
"Remember this is just
going to be a constant",00:03:25.513,00:03:26.538
based on what our ambient temperature is.,00:03:26.763,00:03:28.098
"We're going to assume
our ambient temperature",00:03:28.098,00:03:29.165
"doesn't change as a function of time,",00:03:29.165,00:03:30.838
"it's just such a big
room that our cup of tea",00:03:31.056,00:03:33.623
is not going to actually warm up the room.,00:03:34.127,00:03:36.635
So that's just one of these assumptions,00:03:36.635,00:03:38.030
that we're going to make.,00:03:38.003,00:03:39.327
"So if we do that, if we
divide both sides by this,",00:03:39.354,00:03:42.083
we are going to have...,00:03:42.083,00:03:43.744
"So I'm going to divide both sides,",00:03:43.744,00:03:45.159
I'm going to do this in a new color.,00:03:45.159,00:03:46.491
"If I divide both sides
by that, I get one over T",00:03:46.491,00:03:51.491
"minus T sub a, and let
me multiply both sides",00:03:51.934,00:03:55.739
times the time differential.,00:03:55.739,00:03:57.750
"So I'm going to have, that dT,
our temperature differential.",00:03:57.849,00:04:02.849
"Times our temperature differential,
is going to be equal to",00:04:05.886,00:04:10.299
negative k times our time differential.,00:04:10.073,00:04:15.073
"So once again, to separate the variables,",00:04:18.058,00:04:19.147
"all I did was divide both sides by this,",00:04:20.047,00:04:22.011
and multiply both sides by that.,00:04:22.434,00:04:25.330
"Now I can integrate both sides,",00:04:25.929,00:04:27.980
we've seen this show before.,00:04:27.098,00:04:29.406
So I can integrate both sides.,00:04:30.288,00:04:33.785
And the integral of this is going to be,00:04:33.785,00:04:37.300
the natural log of the absolute value,00:04:37.003,00:04:39.824
of what we have in the denominator.,00:04:40.121,00:04:41.606
And you can do u substitution if you want.,00:04:41.606,00:04:43.515
"If we said u is equal to T minus T sub a,",00:04:43.515,00:04:46.531
"then du is just going to be one dT,",00:04:46.531,00:04:49.687
"and so this is essentially,
you could say the integral",00:04:49.687,00:04:52.434
"of one over u du, and so
it would be the natural log",00:04:52.434,00:04:54.899
"of the absolute value of u,",00:04:54.899,00:04:56.135
and this right over here is u.,00:04:56.135,00:04:58.378
"So this is the natural
log of the absolute value",00:04:58.378,00:05:02.279
"of T minus T sub a, is equal to,",00:05:02.279,00:05:07.155
"and once again I could
put a constant here,",00:05:07.155,00:05:08.814
but I'm going to end up with a constant,00:05:08.814,00:05:09.678
"on the right hand side too so
I'm just going to merge them",00:05:09.678,00:05:12.175
into the constant on the right hand side.,00:05:12.175,00:05:14.618
"So that is going to be equal to, now here,",00:05:14.618,00:05:18.782
"this is going to be negative kt,",00:05:18.782,00:05:23.136
and once again we have plus C.,00:05:23.136,00:05:26.797
"And now we can raise e
to both of these powers,",00:05:26.797,00:05:31.370
or another way of interpreting this,00:05:31.037,00:05:32.413
"is if e to this thing is
going to be the same as that.",00:05:32.746,00:05:36.119
"So we can write this
as, the absolute value,",00:05:36.119,00:05:40.841
let me do that in that same blue color.,00:05:40.841,00:05:43.035
"We can write this as the
absolute value of T minus T sub a",00:05:43.496,00:05:47.345
"is equal to e, something about e I always",00:05:47.345,00:05:51.256
think of the color green.,00:05:51.256,00:05:53.104
e to the negative kt plus C.,00:05:53.104,00:05:58.104
"This of course is the same thing as,",00:06:00.361,00:06:04.260
"this is equal to e to the negative kt,",00:06:04.026,00:06:07.311
we've done this multiple times before.,00:06:07.545,00:06:09.213
Negative kt times e to the C power.,00:06:09.213,00:06:14.213
"And we could just call this
another arbitrary constant.",00:06:21.648,00:06:24.709
"If we called this C1,
then we could just call",00:06:25.258,00:06:28.993
this whole thing C.,00:06:28.993,00:06:30.405
"So this we could say is
Ce to the negative kt.",00:06:30.405,00:06:35.405
"So at least it's starting
to resemble what we did",00:06:38.882,00:06:40.698
when we were modelling population.,00:06:40.698,00:06:41.726
We'll see it's a little bit different.,00:06:41.978,00:06:43.074
"Instead of just temperature
on this left hand side,",00:06:43.074,00:06:44.937
"we have temperature minus
our ambient temperature.",00:06:44.937,00:06:48.190
"And so, we can do a couple of things.",00:06:48.019,00:06:51.164
"If, in a world, say we were
dealing with a hot cup of tea,",00:06:51.335,00:06:55.048
"something that's hotter than
the ambient temperature.",00:06:55.048,00:06:57.974
So we could imagine a world where T is,00:06:57.974,00:07:02.768
"greater than or equal to
our ambient temperature.",00:07:02.768,00:07:05.623
"So that means this is hot, or it's hotter,",00:07:05.623,00:07:09.570
I guess we could say.,00:07:09.057,00:07:10.080
So if we're dealing with something,00:07:10.008,00:07:10.095
"hotter than the ambient temperature,",00:07:11.067,00:07:12.306
"then this absolute value
is going to be positive",00:07:12.909,00:07:15.072
or the thing inside the absolute value,00:07:15.072,00:07:17.081
is going to be positive.,00:07:17.162,00:07:17.956
So we don't need the absolute value.,00:07:17.956,00:07:19.861
Or the absolute value of it is going to be,00:07:19.861,00:07:20.943
the same thing as it.,00:07:20.943,00:07:22.482
"And then we can just add
T sub a to both sides,",00:07:22.482,00:07:26.163
"and then we would have our temperature,",00:07:26.163,00:07:28.740
"and I can even write this
as a function of time,",00:07:28.074,00:07:30.840
"is going to be equal to this business,",00:07:31.506,00:07:33.549
"is going to be equal to Ce, let me do that",00:07:33.936,00:07:38.936
in that same color.,00:07:39.014,00:07:40.562
Ce to the negative kt plus T sub a.,00:07:40.562,00:07:45.562
All I did is I'm assuming that this,00:07:50.733,00:07:52.431
"inside the absolute value
is going to be positive,",00:07:52.431,00:07:54.670
"so the absolute value is not
going to change the value.",00:07:54.067,00:07:56.124
"And I added T sub a to
both sides to get this.",00:07:57.024,00:08:00.591
"So this right over here is going
to be our general solution,",00:08:00.807,00:08:04.508
"in the case where we start
with something that is hotter",00:08:04.508,00:08:09.508
than the ambient room temperature.,00:08:09.744,00:08:11.450
"And if we want to look at the
case where something is cooler",00:08:11.045,00:08:13.259
"than the ambient room temperature,",00:08:13.664,00:08:15.122
"so that's the situation,
let's say T is less than",00:08:15.122,00:08:17.399
our ambient room temperature.,00:08:17.399,00:08:19.050
"Then the absolute value of
T, then this thing over here",00:08:19.005,00:08:21.602
"is going to be negative, and
so the absolute value of it's",00:08:21.647,00:08:24.221
going to be the negative of that.,00:08:24.221,00:08:25.843
"So then this up here
results in T sub a minus T,",00:08:25.843,00:08:30.843
"that's going to be the same
thing as the absolute value,",00:08:31.046,00:08:33.198
"it's going to be the
negative of the negative.",00:08:33.198,00:08:35.481
"So then that is going to be
equal to e to the negative k",00:08:35.481,00:08:40.481
"plus, actually let me just do it...",00:08:50.116,00:08:52.671
T sub a minus T is going to be equal to Ce,00:08:54.013,00:08:59.013
"to the negative kt, so
this is equal to that.",00:09:00.573,00:09:04.991
"I'm just assuming that
T is less than T sub a.",00:09:04.991,00:09:07.623
"And so then, to solve for T,
you could add T to both sides",00:09:07.623,00:09:12.623
and subtract this from both sides.,00:09:12.857,00:09:15.195
"You would have T as a function
of t is going to be equal to,",00:09:15.195,00:09:19.951
"let's see, if this went onto that side",00:09:19.951,00:09:21.598
"and this goes over here,
you would have T sub a",00:09:21.598,00:09:25.894
minus Ce to the negative kt.,00:09:26.479,00:09:31.479
Did I do that right?,00:09:31.907,00:09:33.265
"So yep, that looks right.",00:09:33.265,00:09:34.886
"So this is the situation where
you have something that is",00:09:34.886,00:09:38.912
cooler than the ambient temperature.,00:09:38.912,00:09:43.355
"So this right over
here, based on the logic",00:09:43.355,00:09:45.831
"of Newton's Law of Cooling,
these are the general solutions",00:09:45.831,00:09:50.831
to that differential equation.,00:09:51.061,00:09:52.935
In the next video we can actually apply it,00:09:53.484,00:09:54.492
"to model how quickly something
might cool or heat up.",00:09:55.284,00:09:59.962
