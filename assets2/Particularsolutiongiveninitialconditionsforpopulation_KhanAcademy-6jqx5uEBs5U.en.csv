"- [Voiceover] In the last
video, we established that",00:00:00.354,00:00:02.180
"if we say the rate of
change of a population",00:00:02.017,00:00:04.519
"with respect to time is
going to be proportional",00:00:04.681,00:00:07.319
"to the population, we were able to",00:00:07.319,00:00:09.152
"solve that differential equation,
find a general solution,",00:00:09.152,00:00:12.373
which involves an exponential.,00:00:12.373,00:00:13.910
"That the population is going
to be equal to some constant",00:00:13.091,00:00:16.827
"times e to some other
constant, times time.",00:00:17.646,00:00:21.132
"And in the last video we
assumed time was days.",00:00:21.132,00:00:24.111
"So let's just apply
this, just to feel good",00:00:24.111,00:00:27.300
"that we can truly model
population this way.",00:00:27.003,00:00:29.675
"So let's use it with
some concrete numbers.",00:00:29.972,00:00:31.500
"Once again, you've
probably done that before.",00:00:31.005,00:00:33.254
"You've probably started
with the assumption",00:00:33.749,00:00:36.097
"that you can model with
an exponential function,",00:00:36.097,00:00:38.421
"and then you used some
information, some conditions,",00:00:38.421,00:00:41.532
to figure out what the constants are.,00:00:41.532,00:00:43.206
You probably did this earlier,00:00:43.206,00:00:44.562
in pre-calculus or algebra class.,00:00:44.562,00:00:46.813
"Let's just do it again,
just so that we can feel",00:00:46.813,00:00:49.181
that this thing right over here is useful.,00:00:49.181,00:00:51.907
So let's give you some information.,00:00:51.907,00:00:53.755
"Let's say, that at time equals zero,",00:00:53.755,00:00:57.893
the population is equal to 100 insects,00:00:57.893,00:01:02.893
"or whatever we're measuring
the population of.",00:01:03.807,00:01:06.433
"And let's say that at time
equals 50, the population,",00:01:06.433,00:01:11.433
"so after 50 days, the
population is at 200.",00:01:15.553,00:01:20.553
So notice it doubled after 50 days.,00:01:20.826,00:01:22.861
"So given this information,
can we solve for C and k?",00:01:23.176,00:01:27.278
I encourage you to pause the video,00:01:27.278,00:01:28.691
and try to work through it on your own.,00:01:28.691,00:01:31.759
"So this first initial
condition's pretty straighforward",00:01:31.759,00:01:33.764
"to you, because when t is
equal to zero, P is 100.",00:01:33.809,00:01:36.905
"So we could say, based on this
first piece of information,",00:01:36.905,00:01:41.905
we could say that 100 must be equal to,00:01:42.531,00:01:46.134
C times e to the k times zero.,00:01:46.671,00:01:51.671
"Well that's just going
to be e to the zero.",00:01:56.531,00:01:59.617
Well e to the zero is just one.,00:01:59.617,00:02:02.073
"So this is just the same
thing as C times one,",00:02:02.073,00:02:05.165
"and just like that we have
figured out what C is.",00:02:05.165,00:02:07.242
We can now write that the population,00:02:09.717,00:02:11.743
is going to be equal to 100e to the kt.,00:02:11.968,00:02:16.968
"So you can see, expressed this way,",00:02:19.569,00:02:21.105
"our C is always going to
be our initial population.",00:02:21.105,00:02:24.306
"So, e to the kt.",00:02:24.306,00:02:29.306
"And now, we can use this
second piece of information.",00:02:30.962,00:02:33.343
"So our population is 200,
let's write that down.",00:02:33.343,00:02:36.370
"So our population is 200,
when time is equal to 50.",00:02:36.037,00:02:40.780
After 50 days.,00:02:41.113,00:02:42.602
"So 200 is equal to 100e
to the k times 50, right?",00:02:42.602,00:02:47.602
t is now 50.,00:02:54.696,00:02:56.347
Let me just write that.,00:02:56.347,00:02:57.265
k times 50.,00:02:58.603,00:03:00.952
"Now we can divide both sides by 100,",00:03:00.952,00:03:04.434
"and we will get, two is
equal to e to the 50k.",00:03:04.434,00:03:09.434
"Then we can take the
natural log of both sides.",00:03:15.033,00:03:17.546
"Natural log on the left hand side,",00:03:17.843,00:03:19.742
we get the natural log of two.,00:03:19.742,00:03:21.789
"And on the right hand side, the
natural log of e to the 50k,",00:03:21.789,00:03:25.185
"well that's just going
to be, that's the power",00:03:25.185,00:03:28.077
"that you need to raise e
to, to get e to the 50k.",00:03:28.077,00:03:31.211
Well that's just going to be 50k.,00:03:31.211,00:03:35.270
"All you did was took the
natural log of both sides.",00:03:35.801,00:03:38.713
"Notice, that this equation
that I've just written",00:03:38.713,00:03:40.687
expresses the same thing.,00:03:40.687,00:03:41.620
"Natural log of two is equal to 50k,",00:03:41.062,00:03:42.329
"that means e to the 50k is equal to two,",00:03:42.887,00:03:45.540
"which is exactly what
we had written there.",00:03:45.054,00:03:47.262
And now we can solve for k.,00:03:47.748,00:03:49.491
"Divide both sides by 50,
and we are left with,",00:03:49.491,00:03:53.422
"k is equal to the natural
log of 2, over 50.",00:03:53.761,00:03:58.761
And we're done.,00:04:03.443,00:04:04.151
We can now write the particular solution,00:04:04.151,00:04:05.914
that meets these conditions.,00:04:05.914,00:04:09.066
"So we can now write that our population,",00:04:09.066,00:04:11.562
"and I can even write our
population as a function of time,",00:04:11.562,00:04:15.007
"is going to be equal
to 100 times e to the,",00:04:15.007,00:04:20.007
"now k is natural log of two
over 50, so I'll write that.",00:04:25.642,00:04:29.041
"So, natural log of two over
50, and then that times t.",00:04:29.041,00:04:34.041
If you assume rate of change of population,00:04:37.181,00:04:40.237
"is going to be proportional to population,",00:04:40.741,00:04:42.874
"you assume this information
right over here,",00:04:42.874,00:04:45.140
this function is what is going to describe,00:04:45.014,00:04:47.099
your growth of population.,00:04:47.099,00:04:49.530
