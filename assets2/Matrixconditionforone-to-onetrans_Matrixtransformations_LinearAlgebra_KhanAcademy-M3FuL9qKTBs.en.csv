"Let's say I have
some matrix A.",00:00:00.530,00:00:02.720
"If I'm trying to determine
the null space of A, I'm",00:00:02.720,00:00:06.090
"essentially asking -- I'm
essentially just asking, look",00:00:06.090,00:00:09.200
"if we set up the equation Ax is
equal to the 0 vector, the",00:00:09.200,00:00:14.740
"null space of A is all the x's
that satisfy this equation.",00:00:14.740,00:00:21.090
"All the x's that satisfy
that equation.",00:00:21.090,00:00:29.800
"Ax is equal to the
0 vector, or you",00:00:29.800,00:00:32.370
could call it the system.,00:00:32.370,00:00:33.680
"And the way you would solve it
-- and we've done this many",00:00:33.680,00:00:35.930
"times, this was many videos
ago -- you would make an",00:00:35.930,00:00:38.900
augmented matrix with this.,00:00:38.900,00:00:40.680
"So the augmented matrix
would look like that.",00:00:40.680,00:00:42.510
"And you would have the 0 vector
on the right hand side.",00:00:42.510,00:00:45.320
"And then you'd perform a bunch
of row operations to put the",00:00:45.320,00:00:48.530
"left hand side into reduced
row echelon form.",00:00:48.530,00:00:51.770
"So, you would do a bunch
of operations.",00:00:51.770,00:00:54.070
"The left hand side would go into
reduced row echelon form.",00:00:54.070,00:00:57.040
"Let's call that reduced
row echelon form of A.",00:00:57.040,00:01:00.950
"And then the right hand side
is just going to stay 0,",00:01:00.950,00:01:04.239
"because you performed the
same row operations.",00:01:04.239,00:01:06.100
"But when you perform those row
operations on 0, you just get",00:01:06.100,00:01:09.040
the 0 vector right here.,00:01:09.040,00:01:10.850
"And then when you un-augment--
when you create the system",00:01:10.850,00:01:14.080
"back from this right here,
because these two systems are",00:01:14.080,00:01:16.840
"equivalent, you are essentially
going to have your",00:01:16.840,00:01:19.500
"solution set look something
like this.",00:01:19.500,00:01:21.320
"You're going to have your--
let me write it like this,",00:01:21.320,00:01:23.960
"your solution set is
going to be equal",00:01:23.960,00:01:25.840
to some scalar multiple.,00:01:25.840,00:01:29.230
"Let's say that, of your free
variables, your free variables",00:01:29.230,00:01:31.870
"are going to be the
scalar multiples.",00:01:31.870,00:01:33.060
"And you've seen this
multiple times, so",00:01:33.060,00:01:34.820
I'll stay fairly general.,00:01:34.820,00:01:35.860
"But it's going to be some
multiple times, let's say,",00:01:35.860,00:01:39.520
"vector 1 plus some other scalar
times vector 2, these",00:01:39.520,00:01:45.880
"scalars tend to be your free
variables-- times vector 2 all",00:01:45.880,00:01:49.200
"the way to, I don't
know, whatever, c",00:01:49.200,00:01:52.930
times your nth vector.,00:01:52.930,00:01:55.600
"I'm just trying to
stay general.",00:01:55.600,00:01:56.830
"We haven't seen any examples
that had more than two or",00:01:56.830,00:01:58.910
three vectors here.,00:01:58.910,00:01:59.800
"But this is what, essentially,
your null space is spanned by",00:01:59.800,00:02:03.100
these vectors right there.,00:02:03.100,00:02:05.220
"You get an equation-- you get
a solution set that looks",00:02:05.220,00:02:08.110
"something like that, and you
call that your null space.",00:02:08.110,00:02:11.560
"We've done that multiple
times.",00:02:11.560,00:02:13.220
"Your null space is that,
so it's all the linear",00:02:13.220,00:02:15.340
"combinations, or it's the span,
of these little vectors",00:02:15.340,00:02:20.060
that you get here.,00:02:20.060,00:02:20.690
"And 1 and 2, all the
way to n, n.",00:02:20.690,00:02:25.660
This is nothing new.,00:02:25.660,00:02:26.670
"I'm just restating something
that we've seen multiple,",00:02:26.670,00:02:29.010
multiple times.,00:02:29.010,00:02:29.790
"We actually did this in
the previous video.",00:02:29.790,00:02:32.330
"I just maybe never wrote
it exactly like this.",00:02:32.330,00:02:34.850
"But what about the case when
you're solving the",00:02:34.850,00:02:37.110
inhomogeneous equation.,00:02:37.110,00:02:38.760
"So the inhomogeneous equation
looks like this.",00:02:38.760,00:02:42.090
"So if I want to solve Ax is
equal to b, I would do",00:02:42.090,00:02:47.920
"something very similar
to this.",00:02:47.920,00:02:49.230
"I will create an augmented
matrix.",00:02:49.230,00:02:50.640
"We'll have A on the left hand
side, and I'd put b on the",00:02:50.640,00:02:54.200
"right hand side, and I'll
perform a bunch of row",00:02:54.200,00:02:57.010
"operations to put A into reduced
row echelon form.",00:02:57.010,00:03:01.006
"So, let me do that.",00:03:01.006,00:03:02.750
"So this left hand side will
be the reduced row",00:03:02.750,00:03:05.250
echelon form of A.,00:03:05.250,00:03:07.300
"And then the right hand side,
whatever operations I did on",00:03:07.300,00:03:09.650
"A, I have to do on
the entire row.",00:03:09.650,00:03:11.990
"So I'll also be doing
them to b.",00:03:11.990,00:03:14.040
"So I'll have some
new vector here.",00:03:14.040,00:03:16.010
"Maybe I'll call it the vector--
maybe I'll call that",00:03:16.010,00:03:20.060
the vector b prime.,00:03:20.060,00:03:21.200
"It's going to be different
than b, but let's",00:03:21.200,00:03:22.640
just call it b prime.,00:03:22.640,00:03:24.430
"And so when you when you go back
to your-- I guess when",00:03:24.430,00:03:28.100
"you go out of the augmented
matrix world and rewrite it as",00:03:28.100,00:03:30.520
"a system, and you solve for
it, and we did this in the",00:03:30.520,00:03:32.380
"last video-- you'll get
your solution set.",00:03:32.380,00:03:35.870
"Your solution set that satisfies
this is going to be,",00:03:35.870,00:03:39.345
"x is going to be equal to this
b prime, whatever this new",00:03:39.345,00:03:42.500
"vector is, this b prime plus
something that looks",00:03:42.500,00:03:47.890
exactly like this.,00:03:47.890,00:03:49.770
"It looks exactly like that, in
fact I'll copy and paste it,",00:03:49.770,00:03:52.380
it'll look exactly like this.,00:03:52.380,00:03:56.130
Let me see if it did copy.,00:03:56.130,00:04:01.640
Copy and paste it.,00:04:01.640,00:04:03.600
"Edit, copy, and let
me paste it.",00:04:03.600,00:04:07.680
"So it will look something that
looks exactly like that.",00:04:07.680,00:04:11.090
"And we said in the last video
that you can kind of-- given",00:04:11.090,00:04:17.700
"this you can kind of think of
the solution set to the",00:04:17.700,00:04:19.959
"inhomogeneous equation is
equivalent to some particular",00:04:19.959,00:04:24.430
"solution, let's call that x
particular, some particular",00:04:24.430,00:04:31.070
"solution, plus some member
of your null space.",00:04:31.070,00:04:35.490
"So you could say it's plus some
homogeneous solution.",00:04:35.490,00:04:39.410
"So if you just pick particular
values for a, b and c, all of",00:04:39.410,00:04:42.820
"the different multiples of the
vector that span your null",00:04:42.820,00:04:45.520
"space, you'll get some",00:04:45.520,00:04:46.940
particular homogeneous solution.,00:04:46.940,00:04:49.910
"So what I implied in the last
video, and I didn't show it to",00:04:49.910,00:04:53.380
"you rigorously, is that any
solution to the inhomogeneous",00:04:53.380,00:04:57.725
"system-- let me write it this
way, any solution-- and do it",00:04:57.725,00:05:01.990
"in white-- that's not white--
any solution to the",00:05:01.990,00:05:09.740
"inhomogeneous system Ax is equal
to b, this is a claim I",00:05:09.740,00:05:23.370
"made, will take the form-- some
particular solution--",00:05:23.370,00:05:34.010
"that was this right here,
maybe I should do it in",00:05:34.010,00:05:35.830
"green-- this is this right
here-- When you do the reduced",00:05:35.830,00:05:39.570
"row echelon form, it becomes
that b prime vector.",00:05:39.570,00:05:42.300
"Plus some homogeneous solution,
so some member of",00:05:42.300,00:05:49.270
the null space.,00:05:49.270,00:05:51.580
"Now I didn't prove it to
you, but I implied",00:05:51.580,00:05:53.860
that this is the case.,00:05:53.860,00:05:54.665
"And what I want to in this video
is actually do a little",00:05:54.665,00:05:57.040
"bit of a more rigorous proof,
but it's actually fairly",00:05:57.040,00:05:59.790
straightforward.,00:05:59.790,00:06:01.390
"So let's first of all verify
that this is a solution.",00:06:01.390,00:06:06.040
"So let's verify that
this is a solution.",00:06:06.040,00:06:08.050
"So let's just put this into
out original equation.",00:06:08.050,00:06:10.690
"Let's remember our original
equation was Ax is equal to b.",00:06:10.690,00:06:14.000
So let's verify.,00:06:14.000,00:06:15.250
 ,00:06:15.250,00:06:17.760
Let me write it as a question.,00:06:17.760,00:06:19.950
"Is that particular solution,
plus some homogeneous",00:06:19.950,00:06:24.460
"solution, a solution to
Ax is equal to b?",00:06:24.460,00:06:32.290
"Well to do that you just put
that in the place of x.",00:06:32.290,00:06:35.240
So let's try it out.,00:06:35.240,00:06:37.100
"So A times this guy right here,
times some particular",00:06:37.100,00:06:41.230
"solution, plus some homogeneous
solution is going",00:06:41.230,00:06:46.540
"to be equal to A times the
particular solution, plus A",00:06:46.540,00:06:50.050
"times some member of
my null space.",00:06:50.050,00:06:53.440
And what is this equal to?,00:06:53.440,00:06:54.980
"That is going to
be equal to b.",00:06:54.980,00:06:58.280
Right?,00:06:58.280,00:06:58.510
"We're saying that this
is a particular",00:06:58.510,00:07:00.290
solution to this equation.,00:07:00.290,00:07:02.370
"That is going to be equal to b
and that this is going to be",00:07:02.370,00:07:05.240
"equal to the 0 vector because
this is a solution to our",00:07:05.240,00:07:08.540
homogeneous equation.,00:07:08.540,00:07:10.300
"So this is going to be
equal to b plus 0, or",00:07:10.300,00:07:13.820
it's equal to b.,00:07:13.820,00:07:15.050
"So A times this vector right
here is indeed equal to b.",00:07:15.050,00:07:19.130
So this is a solution.,00:07:19.130,00:07:21.430
"This is a solution, yes.",00:07:21.430,00:07:23.750
"Now the next question is, does
every solution to the",00:07:23.750,00:07:26.850
"inhomogeneous system, or does
any solution to the",00:07:26.850,00:07:29.400
"inhomogeneous system,
take this form?",00:07:29.400,00:07:32.860
"So does any solution x, to Ax
equal to b, take the form x is",00:07:32.860,00:07:48.810
"equal to some particular
solution, plus a member of our",00:07:48.810,00:07:53.200
"null space, or plus a
homogeneous solution.",00:07:53.200,00:07:56.940
"So to do that let's take-- let's
test out what happens",00:07:56.940,00:08:00.700
"when we multiply the vector
A times x-- let me",00:08:00.700,00:08:08.270
write it this way.,00:08:08.270,00:08:09.860
"let's say that x is any solution
to Ax is equal to b.",00:08:09.860,00:08:20.460
Let's start off with that.,00:08:20.460,00:08:21.790
"And let's see what happens when
we take A times x minus",00:08:21.790,00:08:26.800
"some particular solution
to this.",00:08:26.800,00:08:31.130
"So when we distribute the matrix
vector product, you get",00:08:31.130,00:08:34.820
"A times our any solution
minus A times",00:08:34.820,00:08:39.940
our particular solution.,00:08:39.940,00:08:42.460
"Now what is this going
to be equal to?",00:08:42.460,00:08:43.700
"We're saying that this is a
solution to Ax equals b.",00:08:43.700,00:08:46.180
"So this is going to
be equal to b.",00:08:46.180,00:08:47.960
"And of course, any particular
solution to this when you",00:08:47.960,00:08:51.100
"multiply it by A is also
going to be equal to b.",00:08:51.100,00:08:53.870
"So it's going to be b minus b,
so that's going to be equal to",00:08:53.870,00:08:56.310
the 0 vector.,00:08:56.310,00:08:57.780
"Or another way to think about
it is, x, the vector x minus",00:08:57.780,00:09:03.700
"our particular solution is
a solution to A times",00:09:03.700,00:09:12.190
x is equal to 0.,00:09:12.190,00:09:14.180
"Think about this if you take
this, in parentheses right",00:09:14.180,00:09:18.350
"here, and you put it right
there, and you multiply it",00:09:18.350,00:09:20.890
times A you get the 0 vector.,00:09:20.890,00:09:22.880
"We just did that, you get the
0 vector, because when you",00:09:22.880,00:09:25.010
"multiply each of these guys
by A you get b and",00:09:25.010,00:09:27.320
you get b minus b.,00:09:27.320,00:09:28.810
And so that you get 0.,00:09:28.810,00:09:30.740
"So you can say that x minus--
so our any solution x minus",00:09:30.740,00:09:35.990
"the particular solution of x is
a member of our null space.",00:09:35.990,00:09:51.520
Right?,00:09:51.520,00:09:51.760
"By definition our null space is
all of the x's that satisfy",00:09:51.760,00:09:55.420
this equation.,00:09:55.420,00:09:56.910
"So, since its a member of our
null space, we can say that it",00:09:56.910,00:09:59.450
"is equal to-- so our any
solution minus our particular",00:09:59.450,00:10:03.010
"solution is equal to some member
of our null space.",00:10:03.010,00:10:06.920
"We could say that it is equal
to a homogeneous solution.",00:10:06.920,00:10:10.690
There might be more than one.,00:10:10.690,00:10:11.870
A homogeneous solution.,00:10:11.870,00:10:17.245
 ,00:10:17.245,00:10:20.730
"Now, if we just add our
particular solution to both",00:10:20.730,00:10:24.830
"sides of this, we get that any
solution-- remember, we assume",00:10:24.830,00:10:28.300
"that x is any solution to this--
that any solution is",00:10:28.300,00:10:31.780
"equal to our homogeneous
solution, is equal to a",00:10:31.780,00:10:34.420
"homogeneous solution, plus a
particular solution-- or plus",00:10:34.420,00:10:40.120
our particular solution.,00:10:40.120,00:10:41.820
So we've proven it both ways.,00:10:41.820,00:10:43.360
"That this is a solution to our
inhomogeneous equation, and",00:10:43.360,00:10:47.980
"that any solution to our
inhomogeneous equation takes",00:10:47.980,00:10:51.130
this form right here.,00:10:51.130,00:10:53.450
"Now why am I so concerned with
this, and I've been kind of",00:10:53.450,00:10:57.940
"fixated on this inhomogeneous
equation for some time.",00:10:57.940,00:11:00.910
"But we've been talking about the
notion of a transformation",00:11:00.910,00:11:04.060
being one-to-one.,00:11:04.060,00:11:05.310
 ,00:11:05.310,00:11:09.370
"That was one of the two
conditions for a",00:11:09.370,00:11:11.850
"transformation to
be invertible.",00:11:11.850,00:11:14.200
"Now to be one-to-one-- so let me
draw a transformation here.",00:11:14.200,00:11:19.180
"So let's say this is my domain,
X, and this is my",00:11:19.180,00:11:23.930
"co-domain right here, Y, and I
have a transformation that",00:11:23.930,00:11:28.910
maps from X to Y.,00:11:28.910,00:11:30.360
 ,00:11:30.360,00:11:33.630
"In order for T to be
one-to-one-- so I'll write it",00:11:33.630,00:11:37.520
"like this, one-to-one.",00:11:37.520,00:11:40.230
"In order for T to be one-to-one
that means for any",00:11:40.230,00:11:42.830
"b that you pick here, for any
b that is a member of our",00:11:42.830,00:11:50.600
"co-domain, there is at most
one solution to A times x.",00:11:50.600,00:12:02.450
"And I'm assuming that A is our
transformation matrix, so we",00:12:02.450,00:12:05.380
"can write our transformation T
as being equal to some matrix",00:12:05.380,00:12:09.300
"times our vector
in our domain.",00:12:09.300,00:12:11.930
"So this would be Ax if this is
x right here, so T would map",00:12:11.930,00:12:16.790
from that to that right there.,00:12:16.790,00:12:18.830
"So in order for our
transformation to be",00:12:18.830,00:12:21.040
"one-to-one, that means if you
pick any b here, there has to",00:12:21.040,00:12:24.450
"be, at most, one solution
to Ax is equal to b.",00:12:24.450,00:12:28.300
"Or another way to say that is
that there is at most one guy",00:12:28.300,00:12:31.090
"that maps into that element
of our co-domain.",00:12:31.090,00:12:33.750
There might be none.,00:12:33.750,00:12:34.790
"So there could be no solution
to this, but there has to be",00:12:34.790,00:12:36.870
at most one solution.,00:12:36.870,00:12:39.480
"Now, we just said that any
solution to an inhomogeneous--",00:12:39.480,00:12:46.715
"let me write it in blue-- any
solution takes the form-- if",00:12:46.715,00:12:53.610
there is a solution.,00:12:53.610,00:12:54.310
"So if there isn't a solution,
that's fine.",00:12:54.310,00:12:56.350
"That will still satisfy
one-to-one.",00:12:56.350,00:12:58.270
"But if there is a solution, any
solution is going to take",00:12:58.270,00:13:01.050
"the form x particular plus a
member of your null space.",00:13:01.050,00:13:09.500
"Where this guy right here is
a member of the null space.",00:13:09.500,00:13:12.420
"This thing right here just
applies to that guy.",00:13:12.420,00:13:14.980
Right here.,00:13:14.980,00:13:15.340
"Any solution if they exist,
if there are no",00:13:15.340,00:13:17.100
"solutions, that's fine.",00:13:17.100,00:13:18.890
You can still be one-to-one.,00:13:18.890,00:13:20.740
"But if you do have a solution
you can have at most one",00:13:20.740,00:13:23.850
"person that maps to it,
and any solution",00:13:23.850,00:13:25.530
will take this form.,00:13:25.530,00:13:27.580
I just showed you that.,00:13:27.580,00:13:28.840
"Now in order to be one-to-one,
this can only be one solution.",00:13:28.840,00:13:31.780
"The solution set can only
be one solution.",00:13:31.780,00:13:33.610
 ,00:13:33.610,00:13:41.240
"We can only have one solution
here, right?",00:13:41.240,00:13:45.010
What does that mean?,00:13:45.010,00:13:46.120
"That means that this guy
right here cannot be",00:13:46.120,00:13:49.580
more than one vector.,00:13:49.580,00:13:50.940
It just has to be one vector.,00:13:50.940,00:13:53.590
"There's only one particular
solution right there.",00:13:53.590,00:13:57.000
"But this guy right here has to
be-- for any solution set,",00:13:57.000,00:14:01.500
"depending on how you define
it, there's only one",00:14:01.500,00:14:03.200
particular vector there.,00:14:03.200,00:14:04.540
"But this guy, the only way that
you're only going to have",00:14:04.540,00:14:06.620
"one solution is if your null
space is trivial, if it only",00:14:06.620,00:14:14.510
contains the 0 vector.,00:14:14.510,00:14:16.240
"Your null space will
always, at minimum,",00:14:16.240,00:14:18.200
contain the 0 vector.,00:14:18.200,00:14:19.120
"In the last video I think I,
just off the cuff, said that",00:14:19.120,00:14:21.590
"all your null space
has to be empty.",00:14:21.590,00:14:22.750
"But no, your null space will
always, by definition, by the",00:14:22.750,00:14:26.270
"fact that it is a subspace,
it will",00:14:26.270,00:14:29.480
always contain a 0 vector.,00:14:29.480,00:14:30.920
"You can always multiply
A times 0 to get 0.",00:14:30.920,00:14:34.960
"So your null space will
always contain that.",00:14:34.960,00:14:36.930
"But in order to have only one
solution, your null space can",00:14:36.930,00:14:39.450
"only have the 0 vector so
that this can only be 0.",00:14:39.450,00:14:43.340
"And so that your only solution
is going to be the particular",00:14:43.340,00:14:46.040
"solution that you found,
depending on how you got",00:14:46.040,00:14:48.560
"there, but it's only going to
be your particular solution.",00:14:48.560,00:14:51.220
So let me put this this way.,00:14:51.220,00:14:54.760
"So in order to be one-to-one
your null space of your",00:14:54.760,00:15:04.110
"transformation matrix
has to be trivial.",00:15:04.110,00:15:06.830
"It has to contain only
the 0 vector.",00:15:06.830,00:15:11.280
"Now we've covered this many,
many videos ago.",00:15:11.280,00:15:13.590
"What does it mean if your
null space only",00:15:13.590,00:15:16.910
contains a trivial vector?,00:15:16.910,00:15:18.290
Let me make this clear.,00:15:18.290,00:15:19.270
"So if your transformation vector
looks like this, A1,",00:15:19.270,00:15:23.340
"A2, all the way to An, and
you're multiplying it times",00:15:23.340,00:15:28.800
"x1, x2, all the way to xn, and
the null space is all of the",00:15:28.800,00:15:33.650
"x's that satisfy this equation,
0, and you are going",00:15:33.650,00:15:36.385
to have m 0's right there.,00:15:36.385,00:15:39.210
"So if your null space is
trivial, and we're saying that",00:15:39.210,00:15:41.810
"that is a condition for you
to be one-to-one, for your",00:15:41.810,00:15:45.170
"transformation to be one-to-one,
the transformation",00:15:45.170,00:15:47.510
"that's specified
by this matrix.",00:15:47.510,00:15:50.510
"If your null space is trivial,
what does that mean?",00:15:50.510,00:15:53.140
"That means that the only
solution to-- another way of",00:15:53.140,00:15:56.600
"writing this is x1 times a1,
plus x2 times a2, all the way",00:15:56.600,00:16:05.250
"to xn times an, is equal
to the 0 vector.",00:16:05.250,00:16:11.240
"These are equivalent statements
right here.",00:16:11.240,00:16:13.290
"I just multiplied each of
these terms times these",00:16:13.290,00:16:15.250
respective column vectors.,00:16:15.250,00:16:16.360
These are the same thing.,00:16:16.360,00:16:17.760
"Now if you say that your null
space has to be equal to 0,",00:16:17.760,00:16:20.720
"you're saying that the only
solution to this equation",00:16:20.720,00:16:23.270
"right here, the only scalars
that satisfy this equation--",00:16:23.270,00:16:28.270
"oh sorry, these aren't-- let me
actually-- because I wrote",00:16:28.270,00:16:32.950
"the scalars as vectors-- so
this guy right here, this",00:16:32.950,00:16:37.010
"statement right here, is
equivalent to x1 times a1,",00:16:37.010,00:16:39.030
"plus x2 times a2, plus all the
way to xn times an, is equal",00:16:39.030,00:16:45.680
to the 0 vector.,00:16:45.680,00:16:47.710
"Where the x1's through
xn's are scalars.",00:16:47.710,00:16:50.075
"Now, if we say the null space
is 0, we're saying the only",00:16:50.075,00:16:52.680
"way that this is satisfied is
if your x1 all the way to xn",00:16:52.680,00:16:56.890
is equal to 0.,00:16:56.890,00:16:58.740
"And this means, this is our
definition actually, of linear",00:16:58.740,00:17:02.700
independence.,00:17:02.700,00:17:03.350
"That means that a1-- so the null
space being 0 also means",00:17:03.350,00:17:09.200
"that your column vectors of a--
let me write it this way--",00:17:09.200,00:17:15.920
"it also means that a1, a2, all
the way through an, are",00:17:15.920,00:17:23.310
linearly independent.,00:17:23.310,00:17:26.060
 ,00:17:26.060,00:17:29.670
Now what does that mean?,00:17:29.670,00:17:30.930
"If all of these guys are
linearly independent, what is",00:17:30.930,00:17:35.950
"going to be the basis for
your column space?",00:17:35.950,00:17:38.230
"Remember, the column
space is the span.",00:17:38.230,00:17:40.660
"The column space of a is equal
to the span of a1, a2,",00:17:40.660,00:17:47.510
all the way to an.,00:17:47.510,00:17:48.920
"What we just said, if we're
dealing with the one-to-one,",00:17:48.920,00:17:52.840
"or one of the conditions, or the
condition to be one-to-one",00:17:52.840,00:17:55.780
"is that your null space
has to be 0, or only",00:17:55.780,00:17:58.550
contain the 0 vector.,00:17:58.550,00:17:59.900
"If your null space contains the
0 vector, then all of your",00:17:59.900,00:18:01.970
"columns are linearly
independent.",00:18:01.970,00:18:03.790
"If all of these columns span
your column space, and they",00:18:03.790,00:18:08.925
"are linearly independent,
then they form a basis.",00:18:08.925,00:18:13.810
"So that means that a1, a2, all
the way to an, are a basis for",00:18:13.810,00:18:27.430
our column space.,00:18:27.430,00:18:29.520
"And then that means if all of
our column vectors here are",00:18:29.520,00:18:32.880
"linearly independent, they
obviously span our column",00:18:32.880,00:18:34.900
"space by definition, and they
all our linearly independent,",00:18:34.900,00:18:37.880
they form the basis.,00:18:37.880,00:18:39.060
"So the dimension of our basis,
so the dimension of our column",00:18:39.060,00:18:44.610
"space, that's essentially the
number of vectors you need to",00:18:44.610,00:18:48.910
"form the basis, is going
to be equal to n.",00:18:48.910,00:18:50.710
We have n columns.,00:18:50.710,00:18:52.032
"So it's going to
be equal to n.",00:18:52.032,00:18:53.930
"Or another way to say it is that
the rank of your matrix",00:18:53.930,00:18:58.790
is going to be equal to n.,00:18:58.790,00:19:00.990
"So now we have a condition for
something to be one-to-one.",00:19:00.990,00:19:04.520
"Something is going to be
one-to-one if and only if, the",00:19:04.520,00:19:08.630
"rank of your matrix
is equal to n.",00:19:08.630,00:19:10.780
And you can go both ways.,00:19:10.780,00:19:11.680
"If you assume something is
one-to-one, then that means",00:19:11.680,00:19:16.120
"that it's null space here has to
only have the 0 vector, so",00:19:16.120,00:19:19.100
it only has one solution.,00:19:19.100,00:19:20.690
"If it's null space only has the
0 vector, then that means",00:19:20.690,00:19:24.070
"it's columns are linearly
independent.",00:19:24.070,00:19:26.000
"Which means that they all
are part of the basis.",00:19:26.000,00:19:28.790
"Which means that you have
n basis vectors, or you",00:19:28.790,00:19:30.960
have a rank of n.,00:19:30.960,00:19:32.060
Let's go the other way.,00:19:32.060,00:19:32.910
"If you have a rank of n, that
means that all of these guys",00:19:32.910,00:19:35.480
are linearly independent.,00:19:35.480,00:19:37.390
"If all of these guys are
linearly independent, then the",00:19:37.390,00:19:39.470
"null space is just
the 0 vector.",00:19:39.470,00:19:43.240
"The null space is just the 0
vector, this part of your",00:19:43.240,00:19:45.920
solution disappears.,00:19:45.920,00:19:47.460
"And then you are only left
with one solution.",00:19:47.460,00:19:49.410
So you're one-to-one.,00:19:49.410,00:19:50.360
"So you're one-to-one if and
only if the rank of your",00:19:50.360,00:19:55.200
"transformation matrix
is equal to n.",00:19:55.200,00:19:58.620
 ,00:19:58.620,00:19:59.120
