"In the last video, we showed
that the Laplace transform of",00:00:00.680,00:00:05.420
"f prime of t is equal to s times
the Laplace transform of",00:00:05.420,00:00:15.150
our function f minus f of 0.,00:00:15.150,00:00:21.160
"Now, what we're going to do
here is actually use this",00:00:21.160,00:00:23.640
"property that we
showed is true.",00:00:23.640,00:00:25.430
"And use it to fill in some more
of the entries in our",00:00:25.430,00:00:29.630
"Laplace transform table, that
you'll probably have to",00:00:29.630,00:00:33.080
"memorize, sooner or later,
if you use Laplace",00:00:33.080,00:00:35.455
transforms a lot.,00:00:35.455,00:00:37.240
"But we already learned that the
Laplace transform of sine",00:00:37.240,00:00:44.620
"of a t is equal-- and we did
a very hairy integration by",00:00:44.620,00:00:49.520
"parts problems to show that
that is equal to a over s",00:00:49.520,00:00:53.765
squared plus a squared.,00:00:53.765,00:00:58.840
"So let's use these two things we
know to figure out what the",00:00:58.840,00:01:02.500
"Laplace transform of
cosine of a t is.",00:01:02.500,00:01:07.470
"So the Laplace transform
of cosine of a",00:01:07.470,00:01:14.642
t is equal to what?,00:01:14.642,00:01:18.140
"Well, if we assume that the
Laplace transform of cosine of",00:01:18.140,00:01:21.960
"a t is the derivative of some
function, what is it the",00:01:21.960,00:01:26.060
derivative of?,00:01:26.060,00:01:27.170
Right?,00:01:27.170,00:01:27.670
Let me do it on the side.,00:01:27.670,00:01:30.180
"If f prime of t is equal to
cosine of a t, what is a",00:01:30.180,00:01:37.950
potential f of t?,00:01:37.950,00:01:39.200
"Well, it's the antiderivative.",00:01:42.670,00:01:44.020
"And we can just forget about the
constant, because we just",00:01:44.020,00:01:46.240
"have to know nf of t for
which this is true.",00:01:46.240,00:01:49.880
"So what's the antiderivative
cosine of it?",00:01:49.880,00:01:51.720
It's 1/a sine of a t.,00:01:51.720,00:01:59.660
Right?,00:01:59.660,00:02:00.220
"So if this is f prime of t, then
that is equal to s times",00:02:00.220,00:02:09.630
"the Laplace transform of its
antiderivative, or 1/a sine of",00:02:09.630,00:02:20.620
"a t minus the antiderivative
evaluated at 0.",00:02:20.620,00:02:25.830
"Minus 1/a sine of-- well,
a times 0 is 0.",00:02:25.830,00:02:31.140
"Well, sine of 0 is 0.",00:02:31.140,00:02:32.310
So this whole term goes away.,00:02:32.310,00:02:33.725
"This is a constant, right?",00:02:36.540,00:02:37.510
This 1/a.,00:02:37.510,00:02:38.060
And we showed that the Laplace,00:02:38.060,00:02:39.385
transform is a linear operator.,00:02:39.385,00:02:41.300
So we can take it out.,00:02:41.300,00:02:42.320
"So this is equal to s/a times
the Laplace transform",00:02:42.320,00:02:48.490
of sine of a t.,00:02:48.490,00:02:52.290
"And that is equal to
s/a times a over f",00:02:52.290,00:02:56.975
squared plus a squared.,00:02:56.975,00:02:59.910
And the a's cancel out.,00:02:59.910,00:03:01.280
"And that was much simpler than
the integration by parts we",00:03:01.280,00:03:05.520
had to do to figure this out.,00:03:05.520,00:03:07.050
"So then we get that the Laplace
transform of cosine of",00:03:07.050,00:03:13.500
"a t is equal to s over s
squared plus a squared.",00:03:13.500,00:03:21.180
"And in three minutes, we filled
in another table in our",00:03:21.180,00:03:24.630
Laplace transform table.,00:03:24.630,00:03:26.570
"And now we have the two most
important trig functions.",00:03:26.570,00:03:30.190
Let's keep going.,00:03:30.190,00:03:31.260
"We haven't really done much
with polynomials.",00:03:31.260,00:03:34.710
We know a couple of things.,00:03:34.710,00:03:35.960
We did this already.,00:03:41.180,00:03:42.060
"We know that the Laplace
transform of",00:03:42.060,00:03:43.500
1 is equal to 1/s.,00:03:43.500,00:03:46.420
"So let's see if we could use
this and the fact that the",00:03:46.420,00:03:49.600
"Laplace transform of f prime
is equal to s times the",00:03:49.600,00:03:55.750
"Laplace transform of
f minus f of 0.",00:03:55.750,00:04:04.680
Or another way.,00:04:04.680,00:04:05.470
Let's rearrange this.,00:04:05.470,00:04:07.550
"If we know f, how can we
figure out some Laplace",00:04:07.550,00:04:09.860
"transforms in terms of
f prime and f of 0?",00:04:09.860,00:04:12.240
"So let's just rearrange
this equation.",00:04:12.240,00:04:14.460
"So we get the Laplace transform
of f prime.",00:04:14.460,00:04:18.779
"I could write of t, but
that gets monotonous.",00:04:18.779,00:04:22.050
"Plus f of 0 is equal to
s times the Laplace",00:04:22.050,00:04:26.850
transform of f.,00:04:26.850,00:04:30.230
Divide both sides by s.,00:04:30.230,00:04:31.820
"Let me put the Laplace transform
of-- and I'm also",00:04:31.820,00:04:34.800
going to the sides.,00:04:34.800,00:04:35.660
"So I guess the Laplace
transform-- my",00:04:35.660,00:04:39.020
l's are getting funky.,00:04:39.020,00:04:40.270
"The Laplace transform of
f is equal to 1/s.",00:04:40.270,00:04:47.310
"I'm just dividing both sides
by s, so 1/s times this.",00:04:47.310,00:04:50.690
"Times the Laplace transform of
my derivative plus my function",00:04:50.690,00:04:59.270
evaluated at 0.,00:04:59.270,00:05:02.830
"And let's see if we can use this
and this to figure out",00:05:02.830,00:05:06.310
"some more useful Laplace
transforms.",00:05:06.310,00:05:09.180
"Well what is the Laplace
transform of f of",00:05:09.180,00:05:17.106
t is equal to t?,00:05:17.106,00:05:18.370
"Well, just use this property.",00:05:23.390,00:05:25.330
"This is going to be equal
to 1/s times the Laplace",00:05:25.330,00:05:29.980
transform of the derivative.,00:05:29.980,00:05:31.250
"Well, what's the derivative
of t?",00:05:31.250,00:05:33.660
The derivative of t is 1.,00:05:33.660,00:05:35.270
"So it's the Laplace transform
of 1 minus f of 0.",00:05:35.270,00:05:41.840
"When t equals 0,
this becomes 0.",00:05:41.840,00:05:43.540
Minus 0.,00:05:43.540,00:05:45.450
"So the Laplace transform of t
is equal to 1/s times the",00:05:45.450,00:05:51.600
Laplace transform of 1.,00:05:51.600,00:05:53.040
Well that's just 1/s.,00:05:53.040,00:05:53.840
"So it's 1 over s squared
minus 0.",00:05:53.840,00:05:58.530
Interesting.,00:05:58.530,00:05:59.350
"The Laplace transform of 1 is
1/s, Laplace transform of t is",00:05:59.350,00:06:04.530
1/s squared.,00:06:04.530,00:06:05.840
"Let's figure out what the
Laplace transform",00:06:05.840,00:06:08.260
of t squared is.,00:06:08.260,00:06:09.200
And I'll do this one in green.,00:06:09.200,00:06:11.340
"And maybe we'll see
a pattern emerge.",00:06:11.340,00:06:13.830
"The Laplace transform
of t squared.",00:06:13.830,00:06:17.440
"Well, it equals 1/s times the
Laplace transform of it's",00:06:17.440,00:06:25.140
derivative.,00:06:25.140,00:06:25.820
So what's it's derivative?,00:06:25.820,00:06:28.340
"Times the Laplace transform of
2t plus this evaluated at 0.",00:06:28.340,00:06:36.550
"Well, that's just 0.",00:06:36.550,00:06:38.350
"So this is equal to-- well
we can just take",00:06:38.350,00:06:40.660
this constant out.,00:06:40.660,00:06:41.550
"This is equal to 2/s times the
Laplace transform of t.",00:06:41.550,00:06:50.440
"Well, what does that equal?",00:06:50.440,00:06:53.380
We just solved it.,00:06:53.380,00:06:54.300
1/s squared.,00:06:54.300,00:06:54.800
So it's 2/s times 1/s squared.,00:06:54.800,00:06:56.950
"So it's equal to 2/s
to the third.",00:06:56.950,00:07:00.340
Fascinating.,00:07:05.790,00:07:07.040
"Well, let me just
do t the third.",00:07:09.860,00:07:11.940
"And I think then you'll
see the pattern.",00:07:11.940,00:07:15.300
The pattern will emerge.,00:07:15.300,00:07:17.000
The Laplace transform.,00:07:17.000,00:07:20.000
"And this is actually
kind of fun.",00:07:20.000,00:07:22.120
I recommend you do it.,00:07:22.120,00:07:23.340
It's somehow satisfying.,00:07:23.340,00:07:25.430
"It's much more satisfying than
integration by parts.",00:07:25.430,00:07:28.190
"So the Laplace transform of t to
the third is 1/s times the",00:07:28.190,00:07:32.090
Laplace transform of it's,00:07:32.090,00:07:33.560
"derivative, which is 3t squared.",00:07:33.560,00:07:37.450
"Which is-- take the constant
out because",00:07:37.450,00:07:39.900
it's a linear operator.,00:07:39.900,00:07:40.830
"3/s times the Laplace transform
of t squared.",00:07:40.830,00:07:48.270
So it equals what?,00:07:48.270,00:07:49.200
"What's the Laplace transform
of t squared?",00:07:49.200,00:07:50.680
It's 2/s to the third.,00:07:50.680,00:07:52.380
"So this equals 3 times 2 over
what? s to the fourth.",00:07:52.380,00:07:58.470
"And you can put a t/n here and
use an inductive argument to",00:07:58.470,00:08:02.510
figure out a general formula.,00:08:02.510,00:08:04.060
"And that general formula
is-- I think you",00:08:04.060,00:08:06.130
see the pattern here.,00:08:06.130,00:08:07.490
"Whatever my exponent is, the
Laplace transform has an s in",00:08:07.490,00:08:11.750
"the denominator with one
larger exponent.",00:08:11.750,00:08:14.420
"And then the numerator is the
factorial of my exponent.",00:08:14.420,00:08:18.280
"So in general, and this is one
more entry in our Laplace",00:08:18.280,00:08:21.760
transform table.,00:08:21.760,00:08:24.380
"The Laplace transform of t to
the nth power is equal to n",00:08:24.380,00:08:35.059
"factorial over s to
the n plus 1.",00:08:35.059,00:08:42.674
That's a parenthesis.,00:08:47.450,00:08:48.360
"I guess I didn't have to write
those parenthesis.",00:08:48.360,00:08:49.520
That just confuses it.,00:08:49.520,00:08:50.800
"But anyway, when you see this in
a Laplace transform table,",00:08:50.800,00:08:55.270
it seems intimidating.,00:08:55.270,00:08:56.250
"Oh boy, I have n's and I have n
factorials and all of that.",00:08:56.250,00:08:59.150
"But it's just saying with this
pattern we showed, t to the",00:08:59.150,00:09:02.440
"third increase it by 1, so
s the fourth, put another",00:09:02.440,00:09:06.300
"denominator and take three
factorial on the numerator,",00:09:06.300,00:09:08.640
"which is 6, right?",00:09:08.640,00:09:10.200
And that's all it is.,00:09:10.200,00:09:11.440
"So using the derivative property
of Laplace transform,",00:09:11.440,00:09:16.130
"we figured out the Laplace
transform of cosine of a t and",00:09:16.130,00:09:22.240
"the Laplace transform of really
any polynomial, right?",00:09:22.240,00:09:26.610
"Because it's a linear
operator.",00:09:26.610,00:09:27.410
"So now we know t to the
nth power, t to",00:09:27.410,00:09:29.960
the whatever power.,00:09:29.960,00:09:30.860
"And we can multiply
it by a constant.",00:09:30.860,00:09:32.690
"So we know the basic
trig functions.",00:09:32.690,00:09:34.170
"We know the exponential
function.",00:09:34.170,00:09:35.610
"And we know how to take the
Laplace transform of",00:09:35.610,00:09:41.740
polynomials.,00:09:41.740,00:09:42.680
