"Let's do some more
nonhomogeneous equations.",00:00:01.000,00:00:04.300
"So let's take the same problem,
but we'll change the",00:00:04.300,00:00:06.660
right-hand side.,00:00:06.660,00:00:07.360
"Because I think you know how
to solve the-- essentially,",00:00:07.360,00:00:09.200
the homogeneous version.,00:00:09.200,00:00:10.300
"So the same problem as we
did in the last video.",00:00:10.300,00:00:12.810
"The second derivative of y
minus 3 times the first",00:00:12.810,00:00:17.380
"derivative y minus 4
times the function.",00:00:17.380,00:00:20.750
"And now in the last example,
the nonhomogeneous part",00:00:20.750,00:00:23.940
was 3e to the 2x.,00:00:23.940,00:00:25.200
"But we're tired of dealing with
exponent functions, so",00:00:25.200,00:00:28.390
"let's make it a trigonometric
function.",00:00:28.390,00:00:29.880
"So let's say it equals
2 sin of x.",00:00:29.880,00:00:33.350
"So the first step you do is
what we've been doing.",00:00:33.350,00:00:37.740
"You essentially solve the
homogeneous equation.",00:00:37.740,00:00:40.510
"So this left-hand side
is equal to 0.",00:00:40.510,00:00:42.890
"You do that by getting the
characteristic equation r",00:00:42.890,00:00:45.150
"squared minus 3r minus
4 is equal to 0.",00:00:45.150,00:00:49.160
"You get the solutions, r is
equal equal to 4, r is equal",00:00:49.160,00:00:52.360
"to minus 1, and then you get
that general solution.",00:00:52.360,00:00:54.840
We did this in the last video.,00:00:54.840,00:00:57.080
"You get the general solution
of the homogeneous.",00:00:57.080,00:01:01.600
"Maybe we'll call this the
homogeneous solution.",00:01:01.600,00:01:04.129
y homogeneous.,00:01:04.129,00:01:05.580
"We've got the C1 e to the 4x
plus C2e to the minus x.",00:01:05.580,00:01:14.840
"And that's all and good, but
in order to get the general",00:01:14.840,00:01:17.480
"solution of this nonhomogeneous
equation, I",00:01:17.480,00:01:21.410
"have to take the solution of the
nonhomogeneous equation,",00:01:21.410,00:01:23.590
"if this were equal to 0, and
then add that to a particular",00:01:23.590,00:01:26.280
"solution that satisfies
this equation.",00:01:26.280,00:01:29.050
"That satisfies-- when you take
the second derivative minus 3",00:01:29.050,00:01:33.300
"times the first minus 4 times
the function, I actually",00:01:33.300,00:01:35.400
get 2 sin of x.,00:01:35.400,00:01:37.470
"And here once again we'll use
undetermined coefficients.",00:01:37.470,00:01:40.130
"And undetermined coefficients,
just think to yourself.",00:01:40.130,00:01:43.170
"What function, when I take its
second and first derivatives",00:01:43.170,00:01:46.650
"and add and subtract multiples
of them to each other, will I",00:01:46.650,00:01:49.530
get sine of x?,00:01:49.530,00:01:50.980
"Well, two functions end up with
sine of x when you take",00:01:50.980,00:01:53.835
"the first and second
derivatives.",00:01:53.835,00:01:55.230
And the sine and cosine of x.,00:01:55.230,00:01:58.050
So it's a good guess.,00:01:58.050,00:01:58.960
"And that's really what you're
doing it the method of",00:01:58.960,00:02:00.630
undetermined coefficients.,00:02:00.630,00:02:01.970
"You take a guess of a particular
solution and then",00:02:01.970,00:02:04.360
"you solve for the undetermined
coefficients.",00:02:04.360,00:02:07.400
"So let's say that our guess is
y is equal to-- I don't know,",00:02:07.400,00:02:15.710
"some coefficient times
sine of x.",00:02:15.710,00:02:18.930
"And if this was sine
of 2x, I'd put A",00:02:18.930,00:02:21.020
times sine of 2x here.,00:02:21.020,00:02:22.920
"Just because I still want-- no
matter what happens here-- the",00:02:22.920,00:02:27.170
"sine of 2x's or maybe cosine
of 2x's to still exist. If",00:02:27.170,00:02:30.690
"this was a sine of 2x, there's
nothing I could do to a sine",00:02:30.690,00:02:33.730
"of x, or nothing at least
trivial that I could do",00:02:33.730,00:02:35.920
to the sine of x.,00:02:35.920,00:02:36.640
"It would end up with
a sine of 2x.",00:02:36.640,00:02:38.340
"So whatever's here,
I want here.",00:02:38.340,00:02:40.900
"Plus B, some undetermined
coefficient times cosine of x.",00:02:40.900,00:02:48.780
"And once again, this
was sine of 2x.",00:02:48.780,00:02:50.290
I'd want a cosine of 2x here.,00:02:50.290,00:02:52.740
"So let's figure out its first
and second derivatives.",00:02:52.740,00:02:56.030
"So the first derivative of this
y prime is equal to A",00:02:56.030,00:03:05.756
cosine of x.,00:03:05.756,00:03:08.680
"Cosine derivative is minus sine,
so minus B sine of x.",00:03:08.680,00:03:15.170
"And then the second
derivitive--",00:03:15.170,00:03:16.510
I'll write down here.,00:03:16.510,00:03:18.930
"The second derivative
is equal to what?",00:03:18.930,00:03:21.960
"Derivative of cosine is minus
sine, so minus A sine of x",00:03:21.960,00:03:28.640
minus B cosine of x.,00:03:28.640,00:03:30.510
 ,00:03:30.510,00:03:33.330
"I think you're starting to see
that the hardest thing in most",00:03:33.330,00:03:35.420
"differential equations problems
is not making",00:03:35.420,00:03:38.270
careless mistakes.,00:03:38.270,00:03:39.040
"It's a lot of algebra and a lot
of fairly basic calculus.",00:03:39.040,00:03:43.480
"And the real trick is to not
make careless mistakes.",00:03:43.480,00:03:47.250
"Every time I say that,
I tend to make one.",00:03:47.250,00:03:48.930
"So I'm going to focus
extra right now.",00:03:48.930,00:03:51.240
"So anyway, let's take these and
substitute them back into",00:03:51.240,00:03:54.930
this nonhomogeneous equation.,00:03:54.930,00:03:57.110
"Let's see if I can solve
for A and B.",00:03:57.110,00:03:59.820
"So the second derivative
is that.",00:03:59.820,00:04:02.033
 ,00:04:02.033,00:04:04.560
"Let me just rewrite it,
just so that you",00:04:04.560,00:04:06.310
see what I'm doing.,00:04:06.310,00:04:07.450
"So I'm going to take the second
derivative, y prime",00:04:07.450,00:04:08.866
"prime, so that's minus A sine
of x minus B cosine of x.",00:04:08.866,00:04:17.690
"I'm going to add minus 3 times
the first derivative to that.",00:04:17.690,00:04:21.360
"And I'm going to write the sines
under the sines and the",00:04:21.360,00:04:22.960
cosines under the consines.,00:04:22.960,00:04:24.090
So minus 3 times this.,00:04:24.090,00:04:27.390
"So the sine is, let's see.",00:04:27.390,00:04:28.640
"It's plus 3B sine of x
minus 3 times this.",00:04:28.640,00:04:39.370
So minus 3A cosine of x.,00:04:39.370,00:04:49.190
"And then minus 4 times our
original function.",00:04:49.190,00:04:54.160
So minus 4A sine of x.,00:04:54.160,00:05:00.650
Right?,00:05:00.650,00:05:01.050
Minus 4 times that.,00:05:01.050,00:05:02.250
Minus 4 times this.,00:05:02.250,00:05:04.270
Minus 4B cosine of x.,00:05:04.270,00:05:09.332
"And when I take the sum of all
of those-- that's essentially",00:05:09.332,00:05:15.585
"the left-hand side to this
equation-- when I take the sum",00:05:15.585,00:05:17.920
"of all of that, that is
equal to 2 sine of x.",00:05:17.920,00:05:22.870
"I could have written them out
in a line, but it would have",00:05:22.870,00:05:24.740
just been more confusing.,00:05:24.740,00:05:25.215
"And now this makes it easy to
add up the sine of x's and the",00:05:25.215,00:05:28.840
cosine of x's.,00:05:28.840,00:05:30.540
"So if I add up all the
coefficients on the sine of x,",00:05:30.540,00:05:32.960
"I get minus A plus
3B minus 4A.",00:05:32.960,00:05:35.980
"So that looks like minus 5A plus
3B sine of x plus-- and",00:05:35.980,00:05:46.290
"now what are the coefficients
here?",00:05:46.290,00:05:47.620
 ,00:05:47.620,00:05:50.150
"I have minus B and then I have
another minus 4B, so minus 5B",00:05:50.150,00:05:55.380
and then minus 3A.,00:05:55.380,00:05:56.760
"So minus 3A minus
5B cosine of x.",00:05:56.760,00:06:05.890
"The cosine of x should
go right here.",00:06:05.890,00:06:08.520
"So anyway, how do I
solve for A and B?",00:06:08.520,00:06:11.970
"Well, I have the minus 5A
3B is equal to whatever",00:06:11.970,00:06:17.710
"coefficients in front
of sine of x here.",00:06:17.710,00:06:19.430
"So minus 5A plus 3B must
be equal to 2.",00:06:19.430,00:06:25.090
"And then minus 3A minus 5B is
the coefficient on cosine of",00:06:25.090,00:06:28.610
"x, although I kind of
squeezed in the",00:06:28.610,00:06:30.320
"cosine of x here, right?",00:06:30.320,00:06:32.320
"So this must be equal to
whatever the coefficient on",00:06:32.320,00:06:35.040
"cosine of x is on the
right-hand side.",00:06:35.040,00:06:37.320
"Well the coefficient of
cosine of x on the",00:06:37.320,00:06:40.160
right-hand side is 0.,00:06:40.160,00:06:41.940
So that sets up a system of two,00:06:41.940,00:06:44.480
unknowns with two equations.,00:06:44.480,00:06:45.840
A linear system.,00:06:45.840,00:06:47.500
"So we get minus 5A plus
3B is equal to 2.",00:06:47.500,00:06:57.720
"And we get minus 3A minus
5B is equal to 0.",00:06:57.720,00:07:07.326
 ,00:07:07.326,00:07:10.680
"And let's see if I can simplify
this a little bit.",00:07:10.680,00:07:14.170
Let's see.,00:07:14.170,00:07:14.790
"This is a system of two
unknowns, two equations.",00:07:14.790,00:07:16.920
"If I multiply the top equation
by 5 1/3s, right?",00:07:16.920,00:07:23.530
"Actually, let me multiply the
top equation by 5 1/3s.",00:07:23.530,00:07:27.410
"I get minus 25/3 A plus 5B is
equal to 5 1/3s times this.",00:07:27.410,00:07:41.630
5 1/3s times 2 is 10 1/3s.,00:07:41.630,00:07:46.670
"And the bottom equation
is minus 3A minus",00:07:46.670,00:07:50.990
5B is equal to 0.,00:07:50.990,00:07:54.320
Let's add the two equations.,00:07:54.320,00:07:56.310
"I get 10 1/3s is equal to--
these cancel out.",00:07:56.310,00:08:01.250
"That's minus 25/3 minus 9/3
A is equal to 10 1/3s.",00:08:01.250,00:08:17.570
"This is getting a little bit
messier than I like, but we'll",00:08:17.570,00:08:21.260
soldier on.,00:08:21.260,00:08:23.000
So minus 25 minus 9.,00:08:23.000,00:08:28.230
What's minus 25 minus 9?,00:08:28.230,00:08:29.960
So that is 34.,00:08:29.960,00:08:32.120
"So we get 34 over 3A
is equal to 10/3.",00:08:32.120,00:08:41.600
"We can multiply both
sides by 3.",00:08:41.600,00:08:44.059
Divide both sides by 34.,00:08:44.059,00:08:45.770
"A is equal to 10/34, which
is equal to 5/17.",00:08:45.770,00:08:52.360
Nice ugly number.,00:08:52.360,00:08:53.830
"5/17 and now we can
solve for B.",00:08:53.830,00:08:58.000
So let's see.,00:08:58.000,00:08:59.340
"Minus 3 times A minus
3 times A.",00:08:59.340,00:09:05.800
5/17 minus 5B is equal to 0.,00:09:05.800,00:09:12.530
So that's what?,00:09:12.530,00:09:13.430
"Minus 15/17 is equal
to plus 5B.",00:09:13.430,00:09:21.130
"I just took this and put it
on the right-hand side.",00:09:21.130,00:09:23.270
"And then divide both
sides by 5.",00:09:23.270,00:09:28.430
 ,00:09:28.430,00:09:31.180
"Oh, you know what?",00:09:31.180,00:09:31.990
"I realized I made a careless
mistake here.",00:09:31.990,00:09:33.330
Minus 25 minus 9.,00:09:33.330,00:09:34.990
That's the minus 34 over 3.,00:09:34.990,00:09:38.160
so minus 34A is equal to 10.,00:09:38.160,00:09:40.530
"A is equal to minus 10/34
or minus 5/17.",00:09:40.530,00:09:45.510
So minus 3 times minus 5/17.,00:09:45.510,00:09:49.310
"So 5/17 is equal to
plus 5B, right?",00:09:49.310,00:09:55.980
"And then we get B is
equal to 3/17.",00:09:55.980,00:10:01.050
That was hairy.,00:10:01.050,00:10:03.050
"And notice, the hard
part was not losing",00:10:03.050,00:10:05.870
your negative sines.,00:10:05.870,00:10:07.100
"But anyway, we now have our
particular solution to this.",00:10:07.100,00:10:10.710
 ,00:10:10.710,00:10:15.030
"let me try to write in a
non-nauseating color, although",00:10:15.030,00:10:17.140
"I think I picked a
nauseating one.",00:10:17.140,00:10:19.150
"The particular solution is A
minus 5/17 sine of x-- right?",00:10:19.150,00:10:27.480
"That was a coefficient on sine
of x-- plus B plus 3/17 times",00:10:27.480,00:10:33.160
cosine of x.,00:10:33.160,00:10:35.240
"And if we look at our original
problem, the general solution",00:10:35.240,00:10:38.300
"out of this nonhomogeneous
equation would be this-- which",00:10:38.300,00:10:41.310
"is the general solution to the
homogeneous equation, which",00:10:41.310,00:10:44.010
"we've done many videos on--
plus now our particular",00:10:44.010,00:10:47.950
"solution that we solved using
the method of undetermined",00:10:47.950,00:10:52.690
coefficient.,00:10:52.690,00:10:53.330
"So if you just take that and add
it to that, you're done.",00:10:53.330,00:10:56.420
And I am out of time.,00:10:56.420,00:10:57.850
See you in the next video.,00:10:57.850,00:11:00.070
