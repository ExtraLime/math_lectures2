"Let's say that I have some set
V that is a subspace in Rn.",00:00:00.490,00:00:11.120
"And just as a reminder,
what does it mean?",00:00:11.120,00:00:12.750
"That's just some set, or some
subset of Rn where if I take",00:00:12.750,00:00:16.960
"any two members of that subset--
so let say I take the",00:00:16.960,00:00:20.680
"members a and b-- they're both
members my subspace.",00:00:20.680,00:00:24.980
"By the fact that this is a
subspace, we then know that",00:00:24.980,00:00:28.910
"the addition of these two
vectors, or a plus b, is also",00:00:28.910,00:00:33.400
in my subspace.,00:00:33.400,00:00:34.770
"And this is our closure
under addition.",00:00:34.770,00:00:40.655
"And by the fact that it's a
subspace, we also know that if",00:00:43.630,00:00:46.180
"we multiply any member of our
subspace by a scalar -- so the",00:00:46.180,00:00:50.010
"fact that those guys are members
of our subspace -- we",00:00:50.010,00:00:52.530
"also know that if I pick one
of them, let's say a, and I",00:00:52.530,00:00:55.340
"multiply a by some scalar, that
this is also going to be",00:00:55.340,00:00:59.500
a member of our subspace.,00:00:59.500,00:01:01.400
"And we sometimes call this
closure under scalar",00:01:01.400,00:01:07.190
multiplication.,00:01:07.190,00:01:08.440
"And then a somewhat redundant
statement is that V, well it",00:01:11.550,00:01:15.360
must contain the zero vector.,00:01:15.360,00:01:17.030
"And that's true of
all subspaces.",00:01:17.030,00:01:19.050
"V -- let me write it this
way -- the zero vector",00:01:19.050,00:01:22.830
is a member of V.,00:01:22.830,00:01:24.355
"And it would be the zero vector
with n components here,",00:01:24.355,00:01:27.590
because V is a subspace of Rn.,00:01:27.590,00:01:29.820
"And why I say that's redundant,
because if I say",00:01:29.820,00:01:32.350
"that any multiple of these
vectors is also in V, I could",00:01:32.350,00:01:34.970
"just set the scalar
to be equal to 0.",00:01:34.970,00:01:37.300
"So this statement kind
of takes the",00:01:37.300,00:01:39.450
statement into account.,00:01:39.450,00:01:40.630
"But in a lot of textbooks, they
will always write, oh and",00:01:40.630,00:01:43.030
"the zero vector has to
be a member of V.",00:01:43.030,00:01:45.080
"Although, that's kind of
redundant with the closure",00:01:45.080,00:01:47.430
under scalar multiplication.,00:01:47.430,00:01:49.020
Fair enough.,00:01:49.020,00:01:50.570
"Now, let's say that I also have
some transformation T.",00:01:50.570,00:01:55.063
"It is a mapping, a function,
from Rn to Rm.",00:01:58.120,00:02:07.340
"What I want to understand, in
this video is, I have a",00:02:07.340,00:02:11.340
"subspace right here, V.",00:02:11.340,00:02:14.140
"I want to understand whether
the transformation of the",00:02:14.140,00:02:17.600
"subspace -- and what
did we call that?",00:02:17.600,00:02:22.030
"We called that the image of our
subspace, or our subset,",00:02:22.030,00:02:29.020
either way.,00:02:29.020,00:02:29.840
The image of V under T.,00:02:29.840,00:02:35.240
"In the last video, just to kind
of help you visualize it.",00:02:35.240,00:02:37.890
"How did that work or -- we
had some subset of Rn",00:02:37.890,00:02:41.970
that looked like this.,00:02:41.970,00:02:42.830
"It was a triangle that looked
something like that.",00:02:42.830,00:02:46.280
"And that was in Rn, this was
actually in R2, it was a",00:02:46.280,00:02:49.120
"triangle that looked something
like that.",00:02:49.120,00:02:50.850
"And we figured out it's
image under T.",00:02:50.850,00:02:54.020
So we went from R2 to R2.,00:02:54.020,00:02:57.280
and we had our transformation.,00:02:57.280,00:02:58.920
"And it ended up looking
something like this.",00:02:58.920,00:03:01.660
If I remember it properly.,00:03:01.660,00:03:03.352
"It ended up looking like a --
gee, I don't remember it",00:03:03.352,00:03:06.475
"fully, but it was like a
triangle that was skewed like",00:03:06.475,00:03:08.810
"this, rotated.",00:03:08.810,00:03:09.660
"So it was a -- actually I think
it was more like -- I",00:03:09.660,00:03:13.670
think that's right.,00:03:13.670,00:03:14.370
"It was rotated a bit clockwise
like that and it was skewed.",00:03:14.370,00:03:17.880
"But the exact particulars
of that last",00:03:17.880,00:03:20.530
video aren't what matter.,00:03:20.530,00:03:22.060
"What matters is that you are
able to visualize what an",00:03:22.060,00:03:24.790
"image under transformation
means.",00:03:24.790,00:03:26.630
"It means you take some subset of
R2, all of the vectors that",00:03:26.630,00:03:30.700
"define this triangle
right here.",00:03:30.700,00:03:32.760
That's some subset of R2.,00:03:32.760,00:03:34.650
"You transform all of them, and
then you get some subset in",00:03:34.650,00:03:38.010
your codomain.,00:03:38.010,00:03:39.260
"You could call this the image,
because the transformation of",00:03:42.300,00:03:45.560
"that triangle, or if we call
this s, it's equal to the",00:03:45.560,00:03:50.150
transformation of s.,00:03:50.150,00:03:51.810
"Or you could say it's the image
of-- you can just call",00:03:51.810,00:03:58.780
"it the set s, but maybe it helps
you to visualize-- call",00:03:58.780,00:04:00.560
"it the image of this
triangle under T.",00:04:00.560,00:04:06.690
"Or maybe even a neater way of
thinking about it is, this",00:04:06.690,00:04:09.310
"triangle-- that skewed, rotated
triangle-- this one is",00:04:09.310,00:04:16.310
"the image of this right
triangle under T.",00:04:16.310,00:04:21.920
"I think that might make
a little bit of",00:04:21.920,00:04:23.210
visual sense to you.,00:04:23.210,00:04:23.850
"And just as a bit of reminder,
in that last video these",00:04:23.850,00:04:26.090
"triangles, these weren't
subspaces.",00:04:26.090,00:04:28.790
"And just as you could take
scalar multiples of some of",00:04:28.790,00:04:31.900
"the vectors that are members of
this triangle, and you'll",00:04:31.900,00:04:37.220
"find that they're not going
to be in that triangle.",00:04:37.220,00:04:38.690
"So this wasn't a subspace, this
was just a subset of R2.",00:04:38.690,00:04:43.500
"All subsets are not subspaces,
but all subspaces are",00:04:43.500,00:04:47.310
definitely subsets.,00:04:47.310,00:04:48.480
"Although something can be
a subset of itself.",00:04:48.480,00:04:50.770
"I don't want to wander
off too much.",00:04:50.770,00:04:52.600
"But this just helps
you visualize what",00:04:52.600,00:04:54.150
we mean by an image.,00:04:54.150,00:04:55.180
"It means all of the vectors that
are mapped to, from the",00:04:55.180,00:05:03.500
members of your subset.,00:05:03.500,00:05:06.590
"So I want to know whether
the image of V",00:05:06.590,00:05:09.670
under T is a subspace.,00:05:09.670,00:05:11.090
"So in order for it to be a
subspace, if I take the",00:05:18.170,00:05:20.050
"transformation -- let me
find two members of T.",00:05:20.050,00:05:23.740
"Well clearly if I take the
transformation of any members",00:05:23.740,00:05:26.670
"of V, I'm getting members
of the image.",00:05:26.670,00:05:30.230
Right?,00:05:30.230,00:05:30.610
So I can write this.,00:05:30.610,00:05:32.510
"Clearly the transformation of
a and the transformations of",00:05:32.510,00:05:36.520
"b, these are both of members
of our images of V under T.",00:05:36.520,00:05:41.230
"These are both members
of that right there.",00:05:41.230,00:05:44.950
"So my question to you is what
is the transformation of a",00:05:44.950,00:05:53.180
plus the transformation of b?,00:05:53.180,00:05:55.410
"And the way I have written this,
these are two arbitrary",00:05:55.410,00:05:57.800
"members of our image
of V under T.",00:05:57.800,00:06:00.660
"Or maybe I should call
it T of capital V.",00:06:00.660,00:06:02.710
"These are two arbitrary
members.",00:06:02.710,00:06:04.710
So what is this equal to?,00:06:04.710,00:06:06.090
"Well, we know from our
properties, our definition of",00:06:06.090,00:06:08.630
"linear transformations, the sum
of the transformations of",00:06:08.630,00:06:13.770
"two vectors is equal to the
transformation of the sum of",00:06:13.770,00:06:16.110
their of vectors.,00:06:16.110,00:06:18.690
"Now, is the transformation
of a plus b, is",00:06:18.690,00:06:24.060
this a member of TV?,00:06:24.060,00:06:28.130
Is it a member of our image?,00:06:28.130,00:06:30.310
"Well, a plus b is a member of V,
and the image contains the",00:06:30.310,00:06:34.510
"transformation of all
of the members of V.",00:06:34.510,00:06:37.810
"So the image contains the
transformation of this guy.",00:06:37.810,00:06:40.840
"This guy, a plus b
is a member of V.",00:06:40.840,00:06:43.600
"So you're taking a
transformation of a member of",00:06:43.600,00:06:45.490
"V which, by definition, is in
your image of V under T.",00:06:45.490,00:06:50.060
So this is definitely true.,00:06:50.060,00:06:52.410
"Now, let's ask the
next question.",00:06:52.410,00:06:55.070
"If I take a scalar multiple of
some member of my image of V",00:06:55.070,00:07:03.160
"under T, or my T of capital
V, right there.",00:07:03.160,00:07:06.540
"If I take the sum scalar,
what is this equal to?",00:07:06.540,00:07:09.400
"By definition for linear
transformation, this is the",00:07:09.400,00:07:12.510
"same thing as a transformation
of the",00:07:12.510,00:07:14.680
scalar times the vector.,00:07:14.680,00:07:17.910
"Now is this going to
be a member of our",00:07:17.910,00:07:22.030
image of V under T?,00:07:22.030,00:07:24.520
"Well we know that ca is
definitely in V, right?",00:07:24.520,00:07:28.790
"That's from the definition
of a subspace.",00:07:28.790,00:07:30.530
This is definitely in V.,00:07:30.530,00:07:32.055
"And so, if this is in V, the
transformation of this has to",00:07:32.055,00:07:35.960
be in V's image under T.,00:07:35.960,00:07:38.620
"So this is in -- this is
also a member of V.",00:07:38.620,00:07:41.910
"And obviously, you can
set this equal to 0.",00:07:41.910,00:07:46.400
"The zero vector is a member of
V, so any transformation of --",00:07:46.400,00:07:50.830
"if you just put a 0 here, you'll
get the zero vector.",00:07:50.830,00:07:54.530
"So the zero vector is definitely
-- I don't care",00:07:54.530,00:07:56.920
"what this is, if you multiply
it times 0, you are going to",00:07:56.920,00:07:59.970
get the zero vector.,00:07:59.970,00:08:01.190
"So the zero vector
is definitely",00:08:01.190,00:08:02.640
also a member of TV.,00:08:02.640,00:08:05.690
"So we come on the result that
T -- the image of V under T,",00:08:05.690,00:08:12.250
is a subspace.,00:08:12.250,00:08:16.700
"Which is a useful result
which we will be able",00:08:16.700,00:08:18.500
to use later on.,00:08:18.500,00:08:20.370
"But this, I guess, might
naturally lead to the",00:08:20.370,00:08:22.670
"question, what if we go --
everything we have been",00:08:22.670,00:08:26.800
"dealing with so far have been
subsets, with the case of this",00:08:26.800,00:08:30.400
"triangle, or subspaces,
in the case of V.",00:08:30.400,00:08:33.659
"But what if I were to take the
image Rn under T, right?",00:08:33.659,00:08:42.309
"This is the image
of Rn under T.",00:08:42.309,00:08:48.550
"Let's think about
what this means.",00:08:48.550,00:08:50.350
"This means, what do we get when
we take any member of Rn,",00:08:50.350,00:08:55.200
"what is the set of all
of the vectors?",00:08:55.200,00:08:57.270
"Then when we take the
transformation of all of the",00:08:57.270,00:08:59.610
"members of Rn, let
me write this.",00:08:59.610,00:09:01.340
"This is equal to the set of the
transformation of all of",00:09:01.340,00:09:06.400
"the x's, where each x
is a member of Rn.",00:09:06.400,00:09:10.750
"So you take each of the members
of Rn and transform",00:09:10.750,00:09:13.240
"them, and you create
this new set.",00:09:13.240,00:09:15.020
"This is the image
of Rn under T.",00:09:15.020,00:09:17.910
"Well, there's a couple of ways
you can think of this.",00:09:21.385,00:09:24.490
"Remember when we defined
-- let's see, T is a",00:09:24.490,00:09:29.260
mapping from Rn to Rm.,00:09:29.260,00:09:33.680
We defined this as the domain.,00:09:33.680,00:09:36.330
"All of the possible inputs
for our transformation.",00:09:36.330,00:09:39.715
"And we define this
as the codomain.",00:09:39.715,00:09:43.450
"And remember I told you that
the codomain is essentially",00:09:43.450,00:09:46.900
"part of the definition of
the function or of the",00:09:46.900,00:09:49.190
"transformation, and it's the
space that we map to.",00:09:49.190,00:09:52.110
"It's not necessarily all
of the things that",00:09:52.110,00:09:53.610
we're mapping to.,00:09:53.610,00:09:54.670
"For example, the image of Rn
under transformation, maybe",00:09:54.670,00:09:58.350
"it's all of Rm or maybe it's
some subset of Rn.",00:09:58.350,00:10:01.320
"The way you can think about it,
and I touched on this in",00:10:01.320,00:10:03.190
"that first video, is-- and
they'll never, or at least the",00:10:03.190,00:10:05.910
"linear algebra books I looked
at, they didn't specify this--",00:10:05.910,00:10:09.000
"but you can kind of view
this as the range of T.",00:10:09.000,00:10:15.070
"These are the actual members
of Rm that T maps to.",00:10:15.070,00:10:24.190
"That if you take the image of
Rn under T, you are actually",00:10:24.190,00:10:28.210
"finding-- let's say that
Rm looks like that.",00:10:28.210,00:10:35.190
"Obviously it will go
in every direction.",00:10:35.190,00:10:37.310
"And let's say that when
you take-- let me",00:10:37.310,00:10:39.780
draw Rn right here.,00:10:39.780,00:10:41.050
"And we know that T is a
mapping from Rn to Rm.",00:10:44.670,00:10:47.140
"But let's say when you take
every element of Rn and you",00:10:47.140,00:10:51.450
"map them into Rm, let's say
you get some subset of Rm,",00:10:51.450,00:10:56.140
"let's say you get something
that looks like this.",00:10:56.140,00:10:59.300
"So let me see if I can
draw this nicely.",00:10:59.300,00:11:01.682
"So you literally map every point
here, and it goes to one",00:11:01.682,00:11:08.270
of these guys.,00:11:08.270,00:11:08.860
"Or one of these guys can be
represented as a mapping from",00:11:08.860,00:11:12.200
"one of these members
right here.",00:11:12.200,00:11:14.760
"So if you map all of them you
get this subset right here.",00:11:14.760,00:11:18.080
"This subset is, this is
T the image of Rn, the",00:11:18.080,00:11:26.040
image of Rn under T.,00:11:26.040,00:11:28.580
"And in the terminology that
you don't normally see in",00:11:28.580,00:11:30.460
"linear algebra a lot,
you can also kind of",00:11:30.460,00:11:31.790
consider it its range.,00:11:31.790,00:11:33.830
The range of T.,00:11:33.830,00:11:37.760
"Now, this has a special name.",00:11:37.760,00:11:40.320
"This is called -- and I don't
want you to get confused --",00:11:40.320,00:11:42.590
this is called the image of T.,00:11:42.590,00:11:45.480
Image of T.,00:11:45.480,00:11:46.880
"This might be a little
confusing, image of T.",00:11:46.880,00:11:50.480
"So this is sometimes written
as just im of T.",00:11:50.480,00:11:57.480
"Now you are a little confused
here, you are like, before",00:11:57.480,00:11:59.580
"when we were talking about
subsets, we would call this",00:11:59.580,00:12:02.010
the image of R subset under T.,00:12:02.010,00:12:05.770
"And that is the correct
terminology when you're",00:12:05.770,00:12:07.430
dealing with a subset.,00:12:07.430,00:12:08.400
"But when you take, all of
a sudden, the entire n",00:12:08.400,00:12:10.920
"dimensional space, and you're
finding that image, we call",00:12:10.920,00:12:14.160
"that the image of the actual
transformation.",00:12:14.160,00:12:17.170
"So we can also call this set
right here the image of T.",00:12:17.170,00:12:27.160
"And now what is the
image of T?",00:12:27.160,00:12:29.980
"Well, we know that we can
write any-- and this is",00:12:29.980,00:12:33.020
"literally any-- so T is
going from Rn to Rm.",00:12:33.020,00:12:35.990
"We can write T of x-- we
can write any linear",00:12:35.990,00:12:39.900
"transformation like this-- as
being equal to some matrix,",00:12:39.900,00:12:44.530
"some m by n matrix
times a vector.",00:12:44.530,00:12:51.690
"And these vectors obviously
are going to be members of",00:12:51.690,00:12:53.790
Rn-- times sum Rn.,00:12:53.790,00:12:56.810
And what is this?,00:12:56.810,00:12:58.450
"So what is the image -- let
me write it in a bunch of",00:12:58.450,00:13:03.310
"different ways -- what is
the image of Rn under T?",00:13:03.310,00:13:12.290
"So we could write that as T --
let me write it this way.",00:13:12.290,00:13:17.180
"We could write that as T of Rn,
which is the same thing as",00:13:17.180,00:13:23.780
the image of T.,00:13:23.780,00:13:28.130
"Notice we're not saying under
anything else, because now",00:13:28.130,00:13:29.820
"were saying the image of the
actual transformation.",00:13:29.820,00:13:32.200
"Which we could also write
as the image of T.",00:13:32.200,00:13:39.540
Well what are these equal to?,00:13:39.540,00:13:42.850
"This is equal to the set of all
the transformations of x.",00:13:42.850,00:13:47.610
"Well all the transformations of
x are going to be Ax where",00:13:47.610,00:13:53.422
x is a member of Rn.,00:13:53.422,00:13:59.350
"So x is going to be an n-tuple,
where each element",00:13:59.350,00:14:04.420
has to be a real number.,00:14:04.420,00:14:05.770
So what is this?,00:14:05.770,00:14:07.060
"So if we write A-- let
me write my matrix A.",00:14:07.060,00:14:12.880
"It's just a bunch of column
vectors, a1, a2.",00:14:12.880,00:14:17.680
"It's going to have n
of these, right?",00:14:17.680,00:14:19.430
Because it has n columns.,00:14:19.430,00:14:22.000
"And so a times any x is going to
be-- so if I multiply that",00:14:22.000,00:14:26.060
"times any x that's
a member of Rn.",00:14:26.060,00:14:28.550
"I multiply x1, x2, all
the way to xn.",00:14:28.550,00:14:32.340
"We've seen this multiple,
multiple times.",00:14:32.340,00:14:34.220
"This is equal to x1-- the scalar
x1, times a1, plus x2",00:14:34.220,00:14:41.390
"times a2, all the way
to plus xn times an.",00:14:41.390,00:14:47.900
"And we're saying we want the
set of all of these sums of",00:14:47.900,00:14:51.200
"these column vectors, where x
can take on any vector in Rn.",00:14:51.200,00:14:55.400
"Which means that the elements
of x can take on any real",00:14:55.400,00:14:59.280
scalar values.,00:14:59.280,00:15:00.730
"So the set of all of these is
essentially all of the linear",00:15:00.730,00:15:04.010
"combinations of the columns
of a, right?",00:15:04.010,00:15:06.480
"Because I can set these guys
to be equal to any value.",00:15:06.480,00:15:10.380
So what is that equal to?,00:15:10.380,00:15:12.040
"That is equal to, and we
touched on this, or we",00:15:12.040,00:15:14.400
"actually talked about this when
we introduced the idea.",00:15:14.400,00:15:17.340
"This is equal to the
column space of A.",00:15:17.340,00:15:30.670
"Or we just denoted it
sometimes as C of A.",00:15:30.670,00:15:36.570
"So that's a pretty
neat result.",00:15:36.570,00:15:38.520
"If you take -- it's almost
obvious, I mean it's just I'm",00:15:38.520,00:15:42.080
"playing with words a little
bit-- but any linear",00:15:42.080,00:15:43.950
"transformation can be
represented as a",00:15:43.950,00:15:46.530
matrix vector product.,00:15:46.530,00:15:48.520
"And so the image of any linear
transformation, which means",00:15:48.520,00:15:52.040
"the subset of its codomain,
when you map all of the",00:15:52.040,00:15:55.460
"elements of its domain into
its codomain, this is the",00:15:55.460,00:15:58.280
image of your transformation.,00:15:58.280,00:16:00.530
"This is equivalent to the column
space of the matrix",00:16:00.530,00:16:09.900
"that you're transformation
could be represented as.",00:16:09.900,00:16:13.110
"And the column space, of course,
is the span of all the",00:16:13.110,00:16:18.620
column vectors of your matrix.,00:16:18.620,00:16:24.790
"This is just all of the linear
combinations, or the span, of",00:16:24.790,00:16:27.880
"all of your column vectors,
which we do right here.",00:16:27.880,00:16:30.860
"Anyway hope you found that a
little interesting, and you",00:16:30.860,00:16:33.132
"will be able to use these
results in the future.",00:16:33.132,00:16:35.710
