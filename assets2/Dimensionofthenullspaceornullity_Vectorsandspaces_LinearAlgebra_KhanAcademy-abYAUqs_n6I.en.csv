"Let's say I have this matrix
B, here, and I want to know",00:00:00.410,00:00:03.820
what the null space of B is.,00:00:03.820,00:00:08.330
"And we've done this multiple
times but just as a review,",00:00:08.330,00:00:10.720
"the null space of B
is just all of the",00:00:10.720,00:00:14.000
x's that are a member.,00:00:14.000,00:00:18.570
"It's all the vector x's that
are member of what?",00:00:18.570,00:00:20.640
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5 that are members
of r to the fifth, where B, my",00:00:20.640,00:00:28.410
"matrix B, times any of these
vector x's, is equal to 0.",00:00:28.410,00:00:32.540
"That's the definition
of the null space.",00:00:32.540,00:00:34.000
"I'm just trying to find the
solution set to this equation",00:00:34.000,00:00:37.500
right here.,00:00:37.500,00:00:38.100
"And we've seen before, that the
null set of the reduced",00:00:38.100,00:00:43.030
"row echelon form of B is equal
to the null set of B.",00:00:43.030,00:00:49.830
"So what's the reduced row
echelon form of B?",00:00:49.830,00:00:53.180
"And this is actually almost
trivially easy.",00:00:53.180,00:00:56.340
"Let me just take a couple of
steps right here-- to get a 0",00:00:56.340,00:01:00.460
"here, let's just replace row
2 with row 2 minus row 1",00:01:00.460,00:01:06.940
So what do we get?,00:01:06.940,00:01:07.760
Row 2 minus row 1.,00:01:07.760,00:01:09.280
"Row 1 doesn't change, it's
just 1, 1, 2, 3, 2.",00:01:09.280,00:01:14.500
And then row 2 minus row 1.,00:01:14.500,00:01:16.800
1 minus 1 is 0.,00:01:16.800,00:01:19.110
1 minus 1 is 0.,00:01:19.110,00:01:21.050
3 minus 2 is 1.,00:01:21.050,00:01:23.670
1 minus 3 is minus 2.,00:01:23.670,00:01:28.080
4 minus is 2 is 2.,00:01:28.080,00:01:30.580
We're almost there.,00:01:30.580,00:01:32.230
"Let's see, so this is a free
variable right here.",00:01:32.230,00:01:34.250
"This is a pivot variable
right here.",00:01:34.250,00:01:35.780
We have a 1.,00:01:35.780,00:01:37.130
"So let me get rid of that
guy right there.",00:01:37.130,00:01:39.740
"And I can get rid of that guy
right there, by replacing row",00:01:39.740,00:01:43.060
"1 with row 1 minus
2 times row 2.",00:01:43.060,00:01:46.170
"So now row 2 is going
to be the same.",00:01:46.170,00:01:49.390
"0, 0, 1 minus 2, 2.",00:01:49.390,00:01:53.010
"And let me replace row 1 with
row 1 minus 2 times row 2.",00:01:53.010,00:01:57.550
So 1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.,00:01:57.550,00:01:59.450
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.,00:01:59.450,00:02:01.510
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.,00:02:01.510,00:02:04.800
3 minus 2 times minus 2.,00:02:04.800,00:02:08.870
"So that's 3 plus
4 is 7, right?",00:02:08.870,00:02:13.850
"2 times this is minus 4 and
we're subtracting it.",00:02:13.850,00:02:16.380
"And then 2 minus 2 times
2-- that's 2 minus",00:02:16.380,00:02:19.230
4-- it's minus 2.,00:02:19.230,00:02:21.150
"So this is the reduced row
echelon form of B is equal to",00:02:21.150,00:02:27.270
that right there.,00:02:27.270,00:02:28.370
"And then if I wanted to figure
out its null space, I have x1,",00:02:28.370,00:02:34.240
"x2, x3, x4, and x5 equaling--
I'm going to have two 0's",00:02:34.240,00:02:41.180
right here.,00:02:41.180,00:02:42.050
"Now I can just write this
as just a set of",00:02:42.050,00:02:44.770
or a system of equations.,00:02:44.770,00:02:46.290
So let me do that.,00:02:46.290,00:02:47.750
I get x1.,00:02:47.750,00:02:50.725
"I'm going to write my pivot
variables in a green color.",00:02:50.725,00:02:54.020
"x1 plus 1 times x2, so plus
x2, plus 0 times x3.",00:02:54.020,00:03:02.670
Plus 7 times x4.,00:03:02.670,00:03:08.460
"Minus 2 times x5 is equal
to that 0 right there.",00:03:08.460,00:03:14.610
"And then I get my--
this is x3, right?",00:03:14.610,00:03:19.350
"0 times x1 plus 0 times
x2 plus 1 times x3.",00:03:19.350,00:03:23.250
"So I get x3 minus 2 times x4
plus 2 times x5 is equal to",00:03:23.250,00:03:35.080
that 0 right there.,00:03:35.080,00:03:37.220
"And then if we solve for our
pivot variables, right?",00:03:37.220,00:03:39.860
These are our free variables.,00:03:39.860,00:03:40.790
"We can set them equal
to anything.",00:03:40.790,00:03:42.570
"If we solve for our pivot
variables what do we get?",00:03:42.570,00:03:45.440
"We get x1 is equal to-- I
should do that in green.",00:03:45.440,00:03:51.960
The color coding helps.,00:03:51.960,00:03:53.760
"I get x1 is equal to minus x2
minus 7x4 plus 2x5, just",00:03:53.760,00:04:03.790
"subtracted these from both
sides of the equation.",00:04:03.790,00:04:06.390
"And I get x3 is equal to--
we've done this multiple",00:04:06.390,00:04:10.690
times-- 2x4 minus 2x5.,00:04:10.690,00:04:14.770
"And so if I wanted to write
the solution set in vector",00:04:14.770,00:04:17.410
"form, I could write my solution
set or my null space,",00:04:17.410,00:04:23.320
"really, is-- or all
the possible x's.",00:04:23.320,00:04:26.570
"x1, x2, x3, x4, x5.",00:04:26.570,00:04:31.220
"This is my vector
x, that's in r5.",00:04:31.220,00:04:33.970
"It is equal to a linear
combination of these.",00:04:33.970,00:04:37.460
So let me write it out.,00:04:37.460,00:04:40.770
"The free variables are x2 times
some vector right there.",00:04:40.770,00:04:47.900
"Plus x-- is x3, no x3 is
not a free variable.",00:04:47.900,00:04:51.750
"Plus x4, that's my next free
variable, times some factor.",00:04:51.750,00:04:57.130
Plus x5 times some vector.,00:04:57.130,00:05:00.290
I've run out of space.,00:05:00.290,00:05:02.350
Plus x5 times some vector.,00:05:02.350,00:05:04.180
And what are those vectors?,00:05:04.180,00:05:06.570
Let's see.,00:05:06.570,00:05:09.630
"I don't want to make this too
dirty, so let me see if I can",00:05:09.630,00:05:14.960
"maybe move-- nope that's not
what I wanted to do.",00:05:14.960,00:05:18.680
Let me just rewrite this.,00:05:18.680,00:05:21.430
"I haven't mastered this pen
tool yet, so let me",00:05:21.430,00:05:23.980
rewrite this here.,00:05:23.980,00:05:24.690
"So x3 is equal to
2x4 minus 2x5.",00:05:24.690,00:05:30.390
"Let me delete this right
over here so I",00:05:30.390,00:05:33.650
get some extra space.,00:05:33.650,00:05:34.900
Cross that out.,00:05:37.420,00:05:39.065
I think that's good enough.,00:05:39.065,00:05:40.910
"So I can go back to what
I was doing before.",00:05:40.910,00:05:43.050
"x5 times some vector
right here.",00:05:43.050,00:05:45.590
"And now what are
those vectors?",00:05:45.590,00:05:47.440
"We just have to look
at these formulas.",00:05:47.440,00:05:49.650
"x1 is equal to minus
1 times x2.",00:05:49.650,00:05:52.470
So minus 1 times x2.,00:05:52.470,00:05:54.020
Minus 7 times x4.,00:05:54.020,00:05:57.980
Plus 2 times x5.,00:05:57.980,00:06:00.370
Fair enough.,00:06:00.370,00:06:01.300
And what is x3 equal to?,00:06:01.300,00:06:03.292
x3 is equal to 2x4.,00:06:03.292,00:06:05.510
"2x4, right?",00:06:09.700,00:06:12.910
"It had nothing to do with x2
right here, so it's equal to",00:06:12.910,00:06:16.200
2x4 minus 2x5.,00:06:16.200,00:06:18.540
"And then 0 times x2, right?",00:06:21.950,00:06:25.830
"Because it had no x2
term right here.",00:06:25.830,00:06:28.960
And then what is x2 equal to?,00:06:28.960,00:06:31.950
"Well x2 is just equal
to 1 times x2.",00:06:31.950,00:06:34.390
"And so all of these terms
are 0 right there.",00:06:34.390,00:06:36.540
"And I want you to pay
attention to that.",00:06:36.540,00:06:38.300
I'll write it right here.,00:06:38.300,00:06:40.280
"x2 is a free variable, so it's
just equal to itself, right?",00:06:40.280,00:06:43.850
1 and you write a 0 and a 0.,00:06:43.850,00:06:46.300
x4 is a free variable.,00:06:46.300,00:06:48.510
"And this is the important
point of this exercise.",00:06:48.510,00:06:50.360
"So it's just equal to
1 times itself.",00:06:50.360,00:06:52.920
"You don't have to throw in any
of the other free variables.",00:06:52.920,00:06:55.400
And x5 is a free variable.,00:06:55.400,00:06:56.940
"So it just equals 1 times itself
and none of the other",00:06:56.940,00:06:59.870
free variables.,00:06:59.870,00:07:01.050
"So right here we now say that
all of the solutions of our",00:07:01.050,00:07:05.420
"equation Bx equals 0, or the
reduced row echelon form of B",00:07:05.420,00:07:09.120
"times x is equal to 0,
will take this form.",00:07:09.120,00:07:12.080
"Or they are linear combinations
of these vectors.",00:07:12.080,00:07:15.090
"Let's call this v1,
v2, and v3.",00:07:15.090,00:07:19.890
"These are just random
real numbers.",00:07:19.890,00:07:23.530
"I can pick any combination here
to create this solution",00:07:23.530,00:07:26.665
"set, or to create
our null space.",00:07:26.665,00:07:29.120
"So the null space of A, which is
of course equal to the null",00:07:29.120,00:07:35.230
"space of the reduced row echelon
form of A, is equal to",00:07:35.230,00:07:39.810
"all the possible linear
combinations of these 3",00:07:39.810,00:07:42.900
"vectors, is equal to the span
of my vector v1, v2, and v3.",00:07:42.900,00:07:53.340
Just like that.,00:07:53.340,00:07:54.490
"Now, the whole reason I went
through this exercise--",00:07:54.490,00:07:56.730
"because we've done this multiple
times already-- is to",00:07:56.730,00:07:59.690
"think about whether these guys
form a linear independent set.",00:07:59.690,00:08:04.560
"So my question is are these
guys linearly independent?",00:08:04.560,00:08:11.090
"And the reason why I care is
because if they are linearly",00:08:11.090,00:08:13.670
"independent then they
form a basis for",00:08:13.670,00:08:16.290
"the null space, right?",00:08:16.290,00:08:17.490
"That we know that they span the
null space, but if they're",00:08:17.490,00:08:19.860
"linearly independent,
then that's the 2",00:08:19.860,00:08:22.020
constraints for a basis.,00:08:22.020,00:08:23.010
"You have to span the subspace,
and you have to be linearly",00:08:23.010,00:08:26.970
independent.,00:08:26.970,00:08:27.900
"So let's just inspect these
guys right here.",00:08:27.900,00:08:31.210
"This v1, he has a
1 right here.",00:08:31.210,00:08:34.480
"He has a 1 in the second term
because he corresponds to the",00:08:34.480,00:08:39.460
"free variable x2, which is
the second entry, so we",00:08:39.460,00:08:42.620
just throw a 1 here.,00:08:42.620,00:08:43.780
"And we have a 0 everywhere
else in all of the other",00:08:43.780,00:08:46.960
vectors in our spanning set.,00:08:46.960,00:08:50.210
"And that's because for the other
free variables we always",00:08:50.210,00:08:52.180
"wanted to multiply them
times a 0, right?",00:08:52.180,00:08:54.815
"And this is going to
be true of any null",00:08:54.815,00:08:57.060
space problem we do.,00:08:57.060,00:08:57.960
"For any free variable, if this
free variable represents a",00:08:57.960,00:09:00.670
"second entry, we're going
to have a 1 in the",00:09:00.670,00:09:02.100
second entry here.,00:09:02.100,00:09:03.150
"And then a 0 for the second
entry for all of the other",00:09:03.150,00:09:07.060
"vectors associated with the
other free variables.",00:09:07.060,00:09:09.900
"So can this guy ever be
represented as a linear",00:09:09.900,00:09:12.330
"combination of this
guy and that guy?",00:09:12.330,00:09:14.890
"Well there's nothing that I can
multiply this 0 by and add",00:09:14.890,00:09:17.730
"to something that I multiply
this 0 by to get a 1 here.",00:09:17.730,00:09:20.240
It's just going to get 0's.,00:09:20.240,00:09:21.670
"So this guy can't be
representated as a linear",00:09:21.670,00:09:23.330
combination of these guys.,00:09:23.330,00:09:24.880
"Likewise, this vector
right here has a 1",00:09:24.880,00:09:28.880
in the fourth position.,00:09:28.880,00:09:29.880
Why is it a fourth position?,00:09:29.880,00:09:30.940
"Because the fourth position
corresponds to its",00:09:30.940,00:09:32.570
"corresponding free
variable, x4.",00:09:32.570,00:09:35.410
So this guy's a 1 here.,00:09:35.410,00:09:36.750
"These other guys
will definitely",00:09:36.750,00:09:39.190
always have a 0 here.,00:09:39.190,00:09:40.410
"So you can't take any linear
combination of",00:09:40.410,00:09:42.020
them to get this guy.,00:09:42.020,00:09:43.710
"So this guy can't be represented
as a linear",00:09:43.710,00:09:45.590
combination of those guys.,00:09:45.590,00:09:46.860
"And last, this x5 guy, right
here, has a 1 here.",00:09:46.860,00:09:51.640
And these guys have 0's here.,00:09:51.640,00:09:53.610
"So no linear combination of
these 0's can equal this 1.",00:09:53.610,00:09:57.000
"So all of these guys are
linearly independent.",00:09:57.000,00:09:59.500
"You can't construct any of
these vectors with some",00:09:59.500,00:10:01.790
combination of the other.,00:10:01.790,00:10:03.180
"So they are linearly
independent.",00:10:03.180,00:10:06.950
"So v1, the set v1, v2, and v3
is actually a basis for the",00:10:06.950,00:10:19.390
"null space, for the null space
of-- Oh, you know what, I have",00:10:19.390,00:10:23.770
to be very careful.,00:10:23.770,00:10:24.480
For the null space of B.,00:10:24.480,00:10:26.330
"Just for variety, I defined my
initial matrix as matrix B, so",00:10:26.330,00:10:31.940
let me be very careful here.,00:10:31.940,00:10:32.970
"So the null space of B was equal
to the null space of the",00:10:32.970,00:10:36.930
reduced row echelon form of B.,00:10:36.930,00:10:39.700
"It's good to switch things up
every once in a while, you",00:10:39.700,00:10:41.910
"start thinking that
every matrix is",00:10:41.910,00:10:43.280
named A if you don't.,00:10:43.280,00:10:44.420
"And that's equal to the
span of these vectors.",00:10:44.420,00:10:46.540
"So these vectors, and we just
said that they're linearly",00:10:46.540,00:10:48.550
independent.,00:10:48.550,00:10:48.980
"We just showed that because
there's no way to get that one",00:10:48.980,00:10:51.470
"from these guys, that one from
these guys, or that one from",00:10:51.470,00:10:53.780
these guys.,00:10:53.780,00:10:54.820
"These guys form a basis for
the null space of B.",00:10:54.820,00:10:58.420
"Now this raises an interesting
question.",00:10:58.420,00:11:00.300
"In the last video, I defined
what dimensionality is.",00:11:00.300,00:11:04.090
"And maybe you missed
it because that",00:11:04.090,00:11:05.550
video was kind of proofy.,00:11:05.550,00:11:08.080
"But the dimensionality, the
dimension, of a subspace--",00:11:08.080,00:11:14.730
"I'll redefine it here-- is the
number of elements in a basis",00:11:14.730,00:11:25.760
for the subspace.,00:11:25.760,00:11:31.220
"And in the last video I took
great pains to show that all",00:11:31.220,00:11:33.830
"bases for any given subspace
will have the",00:11:33.830,00:11:36.030
same number of elements.,00:11:36.030,00:11:37.190
So this is well defined.,00:11:37.190,00:11:38.740
"So my question to you now is:
what is the dimension of my",00:11:38.740,00:11:44.760
null space of B?,00:11:44.760,00:11:47.560
"What is that the dimension
of my null space of B?",00:11:47.560,00:11:50.630
"Well, the dimension is just
the number of vectors in a",00:11:50.630,00:11:54.200
basis set for B.,00:11:54.200,00:11:55.420
"Well this is a basis set
for B right there.",00:11:55.420,00:11:57.280
"And how many vectors
do I have in it?",00:11:57.280,00:11:58.880
"I have 1, 2 3 vectors.",00:11:58.880,00:12:01.000
"So the dimension of the
null space of B is 3.",00:12:01.000,00:12:04.670
"Or another way to think about
it-- or another name for the",00:12:04.670,00:12:07.760
"dimension of the null space
of B-- is the nullity, the",00:12:07.760,00:12:12.510
nullity of B.,00:12:12.510,00:12:14.970
And that is also equal to 3.,00:12:14.970,00:12:17.410
"And let's think about
it, you know I went",00:12:17.410,00:12:18.870
through all this exercise.,00:12:18.870,00:12:20.010
"But what is the nullity of any
matrix going to be equal to?",00:12:20.010,00:12:23.480
"It's the dimension of
the null space.",00:12:23.480,00:12:25.520
"Well the dimension of the null
space-- you're always going to",00:12:25.520,00:12:27.520
"have as many factors here as
you have free variables.",00:12:27.520,00:12:30.360
"So in general, the nullity of
any matrix of any matrix--",00:12:33.720,00:12:41.680
"let's say matrix A-- is equal
to the number of I guess you",00:12:41.680,00:12:49.160
"could call it free variable
columns or the number free",00:12:49.160,00:12:52.110
"variables in, well, I guess we
call it in the reduced row",00:12:52.110,00:12:59.950
"echelon form, or I guess we
could say the number of",00:12:59.950,00:13:03.790
non-pivot columns.,00:13:03.790,00:13:05.290
"The number of non-pivot columns
in the reduced row",00:13:05.290,00:13:14.700
echelon form of A.,00:13:14.700,00:13:15.730
"Because that's essentially the
number of free variables-- all",00:13:15.730,00:13:18.665
"of those free variables have
an associated, linearly",00:13:18.665,00:13:21.780
"independent vector with
each of them, right?",00:13:21.780,00:13:24.880
"So the number of variables is
the number of vectors you're",00:13:24.880,00:13:27.970
"going to have in your basis
for your null space.",00:13:27.970,00:13:30.450
"And the number of free variables
is essentially the",00:13:30.450,00:13:32.650
"number of non-pivot columns
in your reduced row",00:13:32.650,00:13:35.970
"echelon form, right?",00:13:35.970,00:13:37.870
"This was a non-pivot column,
that's a non-pivot column,",00:13:37.870,00:13:40.520
that's a non-pivot column.,00:13:40.520,00:13:41.870
"And they're associated
with the free",00:13:41.870,00:13:43.370
"variables x2, x4, and x5.",00:13:43.370,00:13:47.510
"So the nullity of a matrix is
essentially the number of",00:13:47.510,00:13:50.710
"non-pivot columns in the reduced
row echelon form of",00:13:50.710,00:13:54.910
that matrix.,00:13:54.910,00:13:55.940
"Anyway, hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.",00:13:55.940,00:13:59.110
