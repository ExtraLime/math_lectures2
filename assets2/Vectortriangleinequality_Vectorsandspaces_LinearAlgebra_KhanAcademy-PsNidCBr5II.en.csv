"In the last video, we showed
you the Cauchy-Schwarz",00:00:00.570,00:00:04.490
Inequality.,00:00:04.490,00:00:05.740
"I think it's worth rewriting
because this is something",00:00:12.690,00:00:15.395
that's going to show up a lot.,00:00:15.395,00:00:16.530
It's a very useful tool.,00:00:16.530,00:00:18.570
"And that just told us if I have
two vectors, x and y,",00:00:18.570,00:00:24.220
they're both members of Rn.,00:00:24.220,00:00:27.120
"And they're both nonzero
vectors.",00:00:27.120,00:00:31.390
"And that was an assumption we
had to make when we did the",00:00:31.390,00:00:33.650
"proof, otherwise there was a
potential of dividing by one",00:00:33.650,00:00:36.970
of their magnitudes.,00:00:36.970,00:00:37.530
"So that would've been
a big no-no.",00:00:37.530,00:00:39.500
"But if we assume that they're
both nonzero, then we can say",00:00:39.500,00:00:42.830
"that the absolute value of their
dot products is going to",00:00:42.830,00:00:48.990
"be less than or equal
to the products of",00:00:48.990,00:00:51.970
their individual lengths.,00:00:51.970,00:00:53.740
"So that's the length of vector x
and we defined that a couple",00:00:53.740,00:00:56.760
of videos ago.,00:00:56.760,00:00:57.730
"And then this is the
length of vector y.",00:00:57.730,00:01:00.890
"And of course, this is just a
regular number and then each",00:01:00.890,00:01:02.870
"of these are just
regular numbers.",00:01:02.870,00:01:04.209
"They're not vectors once
you take a length.",00:01:04.209,00:01:06.190
"The length of a 50 dimensional
vector could just",00:01:06.190,00:01:08.780
be the number 3.,00:01:08.780,00:01:09.940
It's just a scalar value.,00:01:09.940,00:01:11.340
"So this is just scalar
multiplication here.",00:01:11.340,00:01:14.190
"And we also learned that the
only time that this inequality",00:01:14.190,00:01:17.710
"turns into an equality is the
situation where x is equal to",00:01:17.710,00:01:25.310
some scalar multiple of y.,00:01:25.310,00:01:28.040
"And so in some textbooks you'll
say-- and this has to",00:01:28.040,00:01:30.040
be a nonzero scalar multiple.,00:01:30.040,00:01:32.240
But that's a bit obvious.,00:01:32.240,00:01:33.190
"I told you that x and
y are nonzero.",00:01:33.190,00:01:35.800
"So if this was 0 then
x would be 0.",00:01:35.800,00:01:39.910
"And we already said
that x is not 0.",00:01:39.910,00:01:41.800
"But if you want to say there you
could say that you know c",00:01:41.800,00:01:44.180
also is going to be nonzero.,00:01:44.180,00:01:45.440
"But that essentially
just falls out of",00:01:48.170,00:01:50.040
this information there.,00:01:50.040,00:01:51.050
"But if this is the case and if
and only if this is the case,",00:01:51.050,00:01:55.770
"then we can say that the
absolute value of the dot",00:01:55.770,00:01:59.550
"product of the two vectors
is equal to the",00:01:59.550,00:02:03.490
product of their lengths.,00:02:03.490,00:02:07.110
"Now, this is all just
a review of what I",00:02:07.110,00:02:09.220
did in the last video.,00:02:09.220,00:02:10.729
"Now what else can we do
that's useful with it?",00:02:10.729,00:02:12.850
"So let's just play around
a little bit.",00:02:12.850,00:02:16.030
"I can't claim to be
experimenting, I know where",00:02:16.030,00:02:17.890
this is going to go.,00:02:17.890,00:02:19.560
"Let's see what happens
if I were to take the",00:02:19.560,00:02:22.710
length of x plus y.,00:02:22.710,00:02:29.690
"So I'm going to add the two
vectors and then take the",00:02:29.690,00:02:32.240
length of that vector squared.,00:02:32.240,00:02:34.910
"Well we know from a couple of
videos ago that the length",00:02:34.910,00:02:37.420
"squared can also be rewritten as
the dot product of a vector",00:02:37.420,00:02:41.650
with itself.,00:02:41.650,00:02:43.140
"This right here, x
plus y, I know it",00:02:43.140,00:02:44.880
looks like two vectors.,00:02:44.880,00:02:45.860
"But it's two vectors added
to each other.",00:02:45.860,00:02:47.820
"So it's really a vector. x
plus y is a real vector.",00:02:47.820,00:02:50.700
I could graph x plus y.,00:02:50.700,00:02:52.560
"So the length of x plus y
squared, I can rewrite it as",00:02:52.560,00:02:55.980
"the dot product of that
vector with itself.",00:02:55.980,00:02:59.010
So x plus y dot x plus y.,00:02:59.010,00:03:04.870
And all of these are vectors.,00:03:04.870,00:03:05.940
These aren't just numbers.,00:03:05.940,00:03:07.240
And this is the dot product.,00:03:07.240,00:03:08.320
"It's just not normal
multiplication.",00:03:08.320,00:03:10.220
"But we saw two videos ago that
the dot product has the",00:03:10.220,00:03:14.320
"distributive and the
associative and the",00:03:14.320,00:03:15.920
"commutative properties just
like regular scalar",00:03:15.920,00:03:18.210
multiplication.,00:03:18.210,00:03:19.280
"So you can kind of FOIL this out
if that's how you remember",00:03:19.280,00:03:23.930
multiplying your binomials.,00:03:23.930,00:03:24.940
"Or I will think of it more as
just doing the distributive",00:03:24.940,00:03:27.150
property twice.,00:03:27.150,00:03:28.370
"So this can be rewritten
as x dot x.",00:03:28.370,00:03:34.230
"Actually, let me write it as
the distributive property",00:03:34.230,00:03:36.160
"because that's sometimes not
obvious to a lot of people.",00:03:36.160,00:03:38.690
"So let me write this x as a
yellow x and let me write this",00:03:38.690,00:03:43.640
whole term as x plus y.,00:03:43.640,00:03:45.790
"So this right here can be
rewritten as x dot-- so this x",00:03:45.790,00:03:53.550
dot this x plus y.,00:03:53.550,00:03:57.620
"And then it would be plus
this y dot-- I want",00:03:57.620,00:04:02.270
to just switch colors.,00:04:02.270,00:04:04.470
Plus this y dot x plus y.,00:04:04.470,00:04:11.440
"It's good to see that when
you're multiplying these,",00:04:11.440,00:04:13.100
"you're just applying the
distributive property.",00:04:13.100,00:04:15.650
"All I did is I distributed this
term along each of these",00:04:15.650,00:04:19.630
terms into sum right here.,00:04:19.630,00:04:21.430
So then I got this.,00:04:21.430,00:04:22.780
"And then I can distribute each
of these into the sum.",00:04:22.780,00:04:25.240
"So then this becomes-- I'll be
careful with the colors-- x",00:04:25.240,00:04:29.990
dot x plus x dot y.,00:04:29.990,00:04:38.580
"Maybe this was a little bit
overkill, but I think it's",00:04:38.580,00:04:41.070
"good to see that this isn't
just some magic here.",00:04:41.070,00:04:43.030
"And we're just using the exact
properties that we proved with",00:04:43.030,00:04:45.560
the dot product.,00:04:45.560,00:04:46.680
So that's that right there.,00:04:46.680,00:04:48.190
And then it's plus y dot x.,00:04:48.190,00:04:52.655
"Plus this yellow y
dot the yellow x.",00:04:57.850,00:05:06.350
"Sorry, dot the blue y.",00:05:06.350,00:05:10.100
"So the magnitude or the length
of our vector x plus y squared",00:05:10.100,00:05:14.200
can be rewritten like this.,00:05:14.200,00:05:16.780
"And I'll just switch
back to one color.",00:05:16.780,00:05:19.390
"So this equals that and all of
that-- what does this equal?",00:05:19.390,00:05:24.300
This is equal to x dot x.,00:05:24.300,00:05:28.850
What's x dot x?,00:05:28.850,00:05:30.300
x dot x is just the magnitude.,00:05:30.300,00:05:32.216
"So let me write this is just
equal to the magnitude",00:05:32.216,00:05:35.490
of our vector x.,00:05:35.490,00:05:38.740
"I should stop using the
word magnitude.",00:05:38.740,00:05:40.200
"The length of our vector
x squared.",00:05:40.200,00:05:44.100
"And then I have two
terms here.",00:05:44.100,00:05:46.930
"I have an x dot y
and a y dot x.",00:05:46.930,00:05:50.100
"We know that x dot y and y dot
x are really the same thing.",00:05:50.100,00:05:54.830
"We showed that order doesn't
matter when you take the dot",00:05:54.830,00:05:58.150
"product, just like it doesn't
matter with regular",00:05:58.150,00:05:59.750
multiplication.,00:05:59.750,00:06:00.830
"So these are really the same
terms. So we could write plus",00:06:00.830,00:06:04.400
2 times x dot y.,00:06:04.400,00:06:10.430
"And then finally, we have that
last term sitting here.",00:06:10.430,00:06:12.830
We have this y dot y.,00:06:12.830,00:06:14.640
"y dot y is the same thing
as the length of",00:06:14.640,00:06:17.800
our vector y squared.,00:06:17.800,00:06:23.080
"Now, let's see if we can break
out our Cauchy-Schwarz",00:06:23.080,00:06:27.530
Inequality.,00:06:27.530,00:06:29.010
"Or maybe Schwarz, I don't know
if I'm pronouncing it right.",00:06:29.010,00:06:32.360
But x dot y.,00:06:32.360,00:06:33.972
"t We have the absolute value
of x dot y here.",00:06:33.972,00:06:39.250
"But we know that just x dot y is
going to be-- it has to be",00:06:39.250,00:06:46.100
"less than or equal to the
absolute value of x dot y.",00:06:46.100,00:06:48.760
Why is that?,00:06:53.620,00:06:54.780
Well this could be negative.,00:06:54.780,00:06:56.370
"I could show you
examples of dot",00:06:56.370,00:06:57.910
products that are negative.,00:06:57.910,00:06:59.050
"In fact, if x has all positive
terms and y has all negative",00:06:59.050,00:07:03.620
"terms, you're going to have
a negative dot product.",00:07:03.620,00:07:06.740
"So this could be negative
or it could be positive.",00:07:06.740,00:07:09.170
"If it's positive the absolute
value-- their",00:07:09.170,00:07:10.650
equal to each other.,00:07:10.650,00:07:11.750
"If this is negative, than this
absolute value is definitely",00:07:11.750,00:07:14.130
going to be greater than it.,00:07:14.130,00:07:16.690
"We can add to the Cauchy-Schwarz
Inequality and",00:07:16.690,00:07:19.040
this is a bit obvious.,00:07:19.040,00:07:20.300
"We could say look, we could add
a little x dot y is less",00:07:20.300,00:07:27.310
"than or equal to the absolute
value of x dot y.",00:07:27.310,00:07:29.890
"Which is less than or equal to
the length of x times the",00:07:29.890,00:07:33.890
length of y.,00:07:33.890,00:07:35.160
"So x dot y is definite-- this,
the dot product of x with y is",00:07:35.160,00:07:42.580
"definitely less than it's
absolute value of that.",00:07:42.580,00:07:44.940
"Which is definitely less than
the lengths of those two",00:07:44.940,00:07:47.740
multiplied.,00:07:47.740,00:07:49.900
"So if I rewrite this, this
statement right here is",00:07:49.900,00:07:54.870
"definitely less than or equal
to this exact statement.",00:07:54.870,00:08:02.830
"But if I replace these with the
lengths of the vectors.",00:08:02.830,00:08:06.430
"So that is definitely less than
or equal to-- I'm just",00:08:06.430,00:08:10.720
"rewriting this x squared and
I'll write the plus 2 there.",00:08:10.720,00:08:16.470
Plus 2.,00:08:16.470,00:08:17.200
"But I want to make it very clear
what I'm replacing here.",00:08:17.200,00:08:20.110
"And then I have the
plus length of my",00:08:20.110,00:08:22.790
vector y there squared.,00:08:22.790,00:08:25.280
"Now this I'm saying, this is
definitely less than the",00:08:25.280,00:08:27.610
absolute value of x dot y.,00:08:27.610,00:08:30.100
"Which is definitely less, by the
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,",00:08:30.100,00:08:35.400
"definitely less than the product
of the two lengths.",00:08:35.400,00:08:40.770
"So I'm just replacing this
with the product",00:08:40.770,00:08:43.880
of their two lengths.,00:08:43.880,00:08:46.740
"So I'm going to put the length
of x times the length of y.",00:08:46.740,00:08:55.730
"And since this is the
same as that, this",00:08:55.730,00:08:57.420
is the same as that.,00:08:57.420,00:08:58.310
"But this is definitely
less than this.",00:08:58.310,00:09:00.740
"This whole term has to be less
than this whole term.",00:09:00.740,00:09:05.140
"Now let me just remind you
what we were doing.",00:09:05.140,00:09:07.510
"I said that this thing that I
wrote over here, this is the",00:09:07.510,00:09:10.860
same as that.,00:09:10.860,00:09:12.100
"So this thing up here, which is
the same as that, which is",00:09:12.100,00:09:14.690
less than that also.,00:09:14.690,00:09:16.050
"So we can write that the
magnitude of x plus y squared",00:09:16.050,00:09:23.030
"and not the magnitude, the
length of the vector x plus y",00:09:23.030,00:09:25.500
"squared is less than
this whole thing",00:09:25.500,00:09:28.030
that I wrote out here.,00:09:28.030,00:09:30.240
Or less than or equal to.,00:09:30.240,00:09:31.850
"Now, what is this thing?",00:09:31.850,00:09:33.220
"Remember, I mean this might look
all fancy with my little",00:09:33.220,00:09:35.900
"double lines around
everything.",00:09:35.900,00:09:37.840
But these are just numbers.,00:09:37.840,00:09:39.210
"This length of x squared,
this is just a number.",00:09:39.210,00:09:43.070
"Each of these are numbers and I
can just say hey, look, this",00:09:43.070,00:09:45.440
"looks like a perfect
square to me.",00:09:45.440,00:09:46.770
"This term on the right-hand side
is the exact same thing",00:09:49.680,00:09:52.510
"as the length of x plus
the length of y.",00:09:52.510,00:09:57.913
Everything squared.,00:10:03.850,00:10:05.690
"If you just squared this out
you'll get x squared plus 2",00:10:05.690,00:10:09.000
times the length of x times the,00:10:09.000,00:10:10.325
length of y plus y squared.,00:10:10.325,00:10:12.580
"So our length of the vector x
plus y squared is less than or",00:10:12.580,00:10:23.450
"equal to this quantity
over here.",00:10:23.450,00:10:25.500
"And if we just take the square
root of both sides of this,",00:10:25.500,00:10:28.020
"you get the length of our vector
x plus y is less than",00:10:28.020,00:10:33.820
"or equal to the length of the
vector x by itself plus the",00:10:33.820,00:10:42.560
length of the vector y.,00:10:42.560,00:10:45.800
"And we call this the triangle
inequality, which you might",00:10:45.800,00:10:49.470
have remembered from geometry.,00:10:49.470,00:10:50.865
"Now why is it called the
triangle inequality?",00:10:56.030,00:10:58.270
"Well you could imagine
each of these to be",00:10:58.270,00:11:00.430
separate side of a triangle.,00:11:00.430,00:11:01.520
"In fact, let's draw it.",00:11:01.520,00:11:02.600
We can draw this in R2.,00:11:02.600,00:11:04.190
Let me turn my graph paper on.,00:11:04.190,00:11:08.225
"Let me see where the
graphs show up.",00:11:08.225,00:11:10.710
"If I turn my graph paper
on right there, maybe",00:11:10.710,00:11:14.170
I'll draw it here.,00:11:14.170,00:11:15.420
So let's draw my vector x.,00:11:15.420,00:11:18.540
"So let's say that my vector x
look something like this.",00:11:18.540,00:11:23.260
Let's say that's my vector x.,00:11:23.260,00:11:24.730
"It's a vector 2, 4.",00:11:24.730,00:11:26.610
So that's my vector x.,00:11:26.610,00:11:28.860
"And let's say my vector y-- well
I'm just going to do it",00:11:28.860,00:11:32.810
"head to tail because I'm
going to add the two.",00:11:32.810,00:11:35.130
"So my vector y-- I'm going to do
it in nonstandard position.",00:11:35.130,00:11:38.420
"Let's say it's look something
like-- let's say my vector y",00:11:38.420,00:11:42.690
looks something like this.,00:11:42.690,00:11:45.330
Draw it properly.,00:11:45.330,00:11:48.430
That's my vector y.,00:11:48.430,00:11:49.680
What does x plus y look like?,00:11:52.500,00:11:56.060
"And remember, I can't
necessarily draw any two",00:11:56.060,00:11:59.330
"vectors on a two-dimensional
space like this.",00:11:59.330,00:12:01.020
"I'm just assuming that
these are in R2.",00:12:01.020,00:12:03.470
"But this is just to
give you the idea.",00:12:03.470,00:12:04.986
"So then this is their
sum, right?",00:12:07.650,00:12:09.500
"You took from the tail of
x to the head of y.",00:12:09.500,00:12:12.490
"So this vector right here
is the vector x plus y.",00:12:12.490,00:12:17.260
"And that's why it's called
the triangle inequality.",00:12:17.260,00:12:19.000
"It's just saying that look, this
thing is always going to",00:12:19.000,00:12:22.340
"be less than or equal to-- or
the length of this thing is",00:12:22.340,00:12:27.370
"always going to be less than or
equal to the length of this",00:12:27.370,00:12:29.680
"thing plus the length
of this thing.",00:12:29.680,00:12:32.160
"And that's kind of obvious
when you just learn",00:12:32.160,00:12:33.980
two-dimensional geometry.,00:12:33.980,00:12:35.250
"That look, this is a much more
efficient way of getting from",00:12:35.250,00:12:38.880
"this point to this point
than going out here and",00:12:38.880,00:12:40.860
then going out here.,00:12:40.860,00:12:42.200
"And then, what's the case in
which this length is equal to",00:12:42.200,00:12:46.850
these lengths?,00:12:46.850,00:12:47.880
"Well if you keep flattening this
triangle out and you go",00:12:47.880,00:12:50.280
"to the extreme case where
maybe the vector",00:12:50.280,00:12:54.510
x looks like this.,00:12:54.510,00:12:55.760
"And if the vector y is just
kind of going in the exact",00:12:58.950,00:13:03.870
"same-- vector y is going in
the exact same direction,",00:13:03.870,00:13:08.630
"maybe it's going a little
bit further.",00:13:08.630,00:13:09.880
"This is vector x, this
is vector y.",00:13:14.470,00:13:17.790
"Now x plus y will just
be this whole vector.",00:13:17.790,00:13:21.120
"Now that whole thing
is x plus y.",00:13:21.120,00:13:22.770
"And this is the case now where
you actually-- where the",00:13:22.770,00:13:27.070
"triangle inequality turns
into an equality.",00:13:27.070,00:13:29.330
"That's why that little
equal sign is there.",00:13:29.330,00:13:30.480
The extreme case where,00:13:30.480,00:13:32.460
"essentially, x and y are collinear.",00:13:32.460,00:13:35.560
And why does that work out?,00:13:35.560,00:13:36.780
"We can even go back to our
math and understand that.",00:13:36.780,00:13:40.225
So let me turn my graph off.,00:13:40.225,00:13:41.950
"We can go back to
our math here.",00:13:41.950,00:13:44.220
"If I go back to this point,
remember, right here I made",00:13:44.220,00:13:48.050
"the statement, look, this thing
is definitely less than",00:13:48.050,00:13:50.760
this thing over here.,00:13:50.760,00:13:52.180
"But what if I made
an assumption?",00:13:52.180,00:13:56.050
"What if I said that x is equal
to some scalar times y?",00:13:56.050,00:14:04.480
"And actually, I have to be
careful because just some",00:14:04.480,00:14:06.930
"scalar times y-- remember, our
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality said",00:14:06.930,00:14:12.420
"that look, the inequality turns
into an equality if x is",00:14:12.420,00:14:18.290
some nonzero scalar of y.,00:14:18.290,00:14:19.810
And then we can apply this.,00:14:19.810,00:14:21.070
"We can say that the absolute
value of x dot y is the same",00:14:21.070,00:14:24.300
as this over here.,00:14:24.300,00:14:25.440
"But I don't have the absolute
value of x dot y here.",00:14:25.440,00:14:28.600
"I don't know that this
is positive.",00:14:28.600,00:14:29.960
"I can say definitively that this
is a positive quantity",00:14:29.960,00:14:32.340
"because I took the absolute
value of it.",00:14:32.340,00:14:34.280
No absolute value here.,00:14:34.280,00:14:36.090
"So the only way that I can
assure that this is a positive",00:14:36.090,00:14:39.450
"quantity, that this is the same
thing as the absolute",00:14:39.450,00:14:41.430
"value of x dot y is to enforce--
if I'm kind of going",00:14:41.430,00:14:45.500
"to go down this road, is to
enforce that this term right",00:14:45.500,00:14:48.370
"here, that c be positive.",00:14:48.370,00:14:51.740
"Because if c is positive, then
x dot y, if x dot y then that",00:14:51.740,00:14:58.890
"would be the same thing
as cy dot y.",00:14:58.890,00:15:04.840
"Which we know is just the same
thing as c times the magnitude",00:15:04.840,00:15:08.720
of y squared.,00:15:08.720,00:15:10.440
"And the only way that I can
ensure that this expression",00:15:10.440,00:15:12.770
"right here is equal to the
absolute value of x dot y, the",00:15:12.770,00:15:18.340
"only way I can assure this
is that c is positive.",00:15:18.340,00:15:20.830
"If c is negative, then this is
going to be a negative number",00:15:20.830,00:15:24.280
while this is a positive.,00:15:24.280,00:15:25.270
"So if I assume that this is
positive, then I can say that",00:15:25.270,00:15:30.690
"x dot y is equal to the absolute
value of x dot y.",00:15:30.690,00:15:36.590
"And since it's a scalar
multiple, then I could say",00:15:36.590,00:15:39.170
"that that term is equal to, not
just less than or equal",00:15:39.170,00:15:42.820
"to, the magnitude
of x's and y's.",00:15:42.820,00:15:45.490
"So hopefully I'm not
confusing you.",00:15:45.490,00:15:46.660
"So all I'm saying is, if I can
assume that x is some positive",00:15:46.660,00:15:50.650
"scalar multiple of y,
that this wouldn't",00:15:50.650,00:15:53.430
be a less than sign.,00:15:53.430,00:15:54.730
"Then I could say that x dot
y is the same thing as the",00:15:54.730,00:15:57.300
"absolute value of x dot y
since this is positive.",00:15:57.300,00:16:00.500
"And if it's the same thing as
the absolute value of x dot y",00:16:00.500,00:16:03.470
"and it's some scalar multiple
of each other, than we could",00:16:03.470,00:16:05.480
go down this other route.,00:16:05.480,00:16:06.430
"We could say that this
thing here-- I don't",00:16:06.430,00:16:09.850
want to get too messy.,00:16:09.850,00:16:10.700
"We could say that this
is equal to that.",00:16:10.700,00:16:13.980
"If this is equal to that, then
this would have become an",00:16:13.980,00:16:17.350
"equal sign, not a less than
or equal to sign.",00:16:17.350,00:16:20.460
"And then we would have had the
limiting case-- I don't want",00:16:20.460,00:16:24.770
to call it the limiting case.,00:16:24.770,00:16:25.560
"But we could say that x plus y--
we would've done the same",00:16:25.560,00:16:28.920
"work, but we would've had an
equal sign the whole way.",00:16:28.920,00:16:31.080
Would equal the length of x.,00:16:31.080,00:16:34.620
"The length of x plus y would
equal the length of x plus the",00:16:34.620,00:16:37.070
"length of y in the situation
where x is equal to some",00:16:37.070,00:16:42.030
positive scalar times y.,00:16:42.030,00:16:43.930
So c is greater than 0.,00:16:43.930,00:16:48.480
These two imply each other.,00:16:48.480,00:16:50.200
And we saw that geometrically.,00:16:50.200,00:16:53.060
"I lost my axes here, but we see
that the only time that",00:16:53.060,00:16:56.820
"the length of x plus y is equal
to the length of x plus",00:16:56.820,00:16:59.795
"the length of y is when
they're collinear.",00:16:59.795,00:17:02.550
"Over here this plus this is
clearly-- you can just",00:17:02.550,00:17:04.720
"visually look at it-- longer
than this right there.",00:17:04.720,00:17:09.079
"So you might be saying Sal,
once again, this linear",00:17:09.079,00:17:11.930
algebra's a little bit silly.,00:17:11.930,00:17:13.440
"We learned the triangle
inequality in",00:17:13.440,00:17:15.250
eighth or ninth grade.,00:17:15.250,00:17:16.700
"Why did you go through all of
this pain to redefine it?",00:17:16.700,00:17:19.300
"And this is the interesting
thing.",00:17:19.300,00:17:20.800
"What I just drew here and this
is what you learned in ninth",00:17:20.800,00:17:24.750
grade geometry.,00:17:24.750,00:17:26.290
This is just in R2.,00:17:26.290,00:17:27.890
"This is just your Cartesian
coordinates, or I don't want",00:17:27.890,00:17:31.085
"to use the word dimension too
much because we're going to",00:17:31.085,00:17:33.120
define that formally.,00:17:33.120,00:17:33.870
"But this is kind of your
two-dimensional space",00:17:33.870,00:17:36.290
that's going on.,00:17:36.290,00:17:37.900
"What's interesting or what's
useful about linear algebra",00:17:37.900,00:17:41.440
"is, we've just defined the
triangle inequality for",00:17:41.440,00:17:44.890
"arbitrarily large vectors,
or vectors that have an",00:17:44.890,00:17:49.930
"arbitrarily high number
of components.",00:17:49.930,00:17:51.810
"Each of these, these don't
have to be in R2.",00:17:51.810,00:17:56.170
"This is true if we're in R100
where every vector has a",00:17:56.170,00:18:00.830
hundred components to it.,00:18:00.830,00:18:02.500
"We've just defined some notion
of the triangle inequality.",00:18:02.500,00:18:06.270
"We've abstracted well beyond
just our two-dimensional",00:18:06.270,00:18:09.790
Cartesian coordinates.,00:18:09.790,00:18:10.800
"Well beyond even our three
dimensions to essentially, n",00:18:10.800,00:18:14.380
dimensional space.,00:18:14.380,00:18:15.210
"And I haven't defined dimensions
yet, but I think",00:18:15.210,00:18:16.770
"you're starting to appreciate
what they are.",00:18:16.770,00:18:19.400
"But anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.",00:18:19.400,00:18:22.400
We can now take this result.,00:18:22.400,00:18:24.165
"And actually, that result with
this result and define what",00:18:26.795,00:18:31.190
"the notion of an angle between
two vectors are.",00:18:31.190,00:18:33.910
"Once again, you know, on some
levels you're like well, why",00:18:33.910,00:18:37.010
do we have to define an angle?,00:18:37.010,00:18:37.640
"Isn't an angle just-- isn't
that just an angle?",00:18:37.640,00:18:41.480
"Well yeah, we know what an angle
is in two dimensions,",00:18:41.480,00:18:43.510
"but what does an angle mean when
you abstract things to n",00:18:43.510,00:18:46.510
dimensions?,00:18:46.510,00:18:47.270
Or when you're in Rn.,00:18:47.270,00:18:49.580
"So that's what we'll talk
about in the next video.",00:18:49.580,00:18:52.550
