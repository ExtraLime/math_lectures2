"Let's keep building our table of
Laplace transforms. And now",00:00:00.750,00:00:04.320
"we'll do a fairly hairy problem,
so I'm going to have",00:00:04.320,00:00:07.910
"to focus so that I don't make
a careless mistake.",00:00:07.910,00:00:12.500
"But let's say we want to take
the Laplace transform-- and",00:00:12.500,00:00:16.090
this is a useful one.,00:00:16.090,00:00:18.630
"Actually, all of them we've
done so far are useful.",00:00:18.630,00:00:20.620
"I'll tell you when we start
doing not-so-useful ones.",00:00:20.620,00:00:23.740
"Let's say we want to take the
Laplace transform of the sine",00:00:23.740,00:00:27.650
of some constant times t.,00:00:27.650,00:00:31.700
"Well, our definition of the
Laplace transform, that says",00:00:31.700,00:00:35.200
"that it's the improper
integral.",00:00:35.200,00:00:37.210
"And remember, the Laplace
transform is just a",00:00:37.210,00:00:38.890
definition.,00:00:38.890,00:00:39.350
"It's just a tool that
has turned out to",00:00:39.350,00:00:41.440
be extremely useful.,00:00:41.440,00:00:43.410
"And we'll do more on that
intuition later on.",00:00:43.410,00:00:46.000
"But anyway, it's the integral
from 0 to infinity of e to the",00:00:46.000,00:00:50.660
"minus st, times-- whatever
we're taking the Laplace",00:00:50.660,00:00:53.750
"transform of-- times
sine of at, dt.",00:00:53.750,00:01:01.560
"And now, we have to go back and
find our integration by",00:01:01.560,00:01:07.380
parts neuron.,00:01:07.380,00:01:08.010
"And mine always disappears,
so we have to reprove",00:01:08.010,00:01:12.590
integration by parts.,00:01:12.590,00:01:13.530
"I don't recommend you do
this all the time.",00:01:13.530,00:01:14.940
"If you have to do this on an
exam, you might want to",00:01:14.940,00:01:16.720
memorize it before the exam.,00:01:16.720,00:01:17.970
"But always remember, integration
by parts is just",00:01:17.970,00:01:20.280
the product rule in reverse.,00:01:20.280,00:01:21.950
"So I'll just do that
in this corner.",00:01:21.950,00:01:23.290
"So the product rule tells
us if we have two",00:01:23.290,00:01:24.760
"functions, u times v.",00:01:24.760,00:01:28.220
"And if I were take the
derivative of u times v.",00:01:28.220,00:01:32.440
"Let's say that they're
functions of t.",00:01:32.440,00:01:34.200
These are both functions of t.,00:01:34.200,00:01:35.290
"I could have written u
of x times v of x.",00:01:35.290,00:01:37.560
"Then that equals the derivative
of the first times",00:01:37.560,00:01:41.140
"the second function, plus the
first function times the",00:01:41.140,00:01:45.140
derivative of the second.,00:01:45.140,00:01:46.600
"Now, if I were to integrate both
sides, I get uv-- this",00:01:46.600,00:01:50.540
"should be review-- is equal to
the integral of u prime v,",00:01:50.540,00:01:54.780
"with respect to dt-- but I'm
just doing a little bit of",00:01:54.780,00:01:56.580
"shorthand now-- plus the
integral of uv prime.",00:01:56.580,00:02:01.570
"I'm just trying to help myself
remember this thing.",00:02:01.570,00:02:04.790
"And let's take this and subtract
it from both sides.",00:02:04.790,00:02:07.460
"So we have this integral of u
prime v is going to be equal",00:02:07.460,00:02:17.240
"to this, uv minus the integral
of uv prime.",00:02:17.240,00:02:24.620
"And, of course, this
is a function of t.",00:02:24.620,00:02:25.920
"There's a dt here
and all of that.",00:02:25.920,00:02:27.370
"But I just have to do this in
the corner of my page a lot,",00:02:27.370,00:02:29.770
"because I always forget this,
and with the primes and the",00:02:29.770,00:02:32.780
"integrals and all that,
I always forget it.",00:02:32.780,00:02:34.460
"One way, if you did want to
memorize it, you said, OK, the",00:02:34.460,00:02:38.070
"integration by parts says if
I take the integral of the",00:02:38.070,00:02:40.580
"derivative of one thing and then
just a regular function",00:02:40.580,00:02:44.530
"of another, it equals the two
functions times each other,",00:02:44.530,00:02:47.560
"minus the integral
of the reverse.",00:02:47.560,00:02:50.170
Right?,00:02:50.170,00:02:50.520
"Here, when you take the
subtraction, you're taking the",00:02:50.520,00:02:54.080
"one that had a derivative,
now it doesn't.",00:02:54.080,00:02:55.530
"And the one that didn't have
a derivative, now it does.",00:02:55.530,00:02:58.370
"But anyway, let's apply
that to our problem at",00:02:58.370,00:03:01.610
"hand, to this one.",00:03:01.610,00:03:03.730
"Well, we could go either
way about it.",00:03:03.730,00:03:07.060
"Let's make u prime is equal to--
we'll do our definition--",00:03:07.060,00:03:12.930
"u prime is equal to e to the
minus st, in which case you",00:03:12.930,00:03:19.580
"would be the antiderivative of
that, which is equal to minus",00:03:19.580,00:03:22.890
"1 over s e to the
minus st, right?",00:03:22.890,00:03:30.415
"And actually, this is going to
be an integration by parts",00:03:30.415,00:03:33.950
"twice problem, so I'm just
actually going to define the",00:03:33.950,00:03:36.170
Laplace transform as y.,00:03:36.170,00:03:38.950
"That'll come in useful
later on.",00:03:38.950,00:03:40.240
"And I think I actually did a
very similar example to this",00:03:40.240,00:03:43.810
"when we did integration
by parts.",00:03:43.810,00:03:45.620
"But anyway, back to the
integration by parts.",00:03:45.620,00:03:47.660
So that's u.,00:03:47.660,00:03:48.760
"And let me do v in a
different color.",00:03:48.760,00:03:50.980
"So when v-- if this
is u prime, right?",00:03:50.980,00:03:54.960
"This is u prime,
then this is v.",00:03:54.960,00:03:56.510
So v is equal to sine of at.,00:03:56.510,00:04:01.395
And then what is v prime?,00:04:01.395,00:04:04.320
"Well, that's just a cosine
of at, right?",00:04:04.320,00:04:07.930
The chain rule.,00:04:07.930,00:04:09.110
"And now, we're ready to
do our integration.",00:04:09.110,00:04:12.120
"So the Laplace transform, and
I'll just say that's y, y is",00:04:12.120,00:04:17.519
"equal to-- y is what we're
trying to solve for, the",00:04:17.519,00:04:21.529
"Laplace transform of sine
of at-- that is",00:04:21.529,00:04:24.070
equal to u prime v.,00:04:24.070,00:04:27.210
"I defined u prime in v, right?",00:04:27.210,00:04:28.880
That's equal to that.,00:04:28.880,00:04:29.650
"The integral of u
prime times v.",00:04:29.650,00:04:31.940
That equals uv.,00:04:31.940,00:04:34.260
"So that's minus 1 over s e to
the minus st, times v, sine of",00:04:34.260,00:04:46.700
"at, minus the integral.",00:04:46.700,00:04:52.580
"And when you do the integration
by parts, this",00:04:52.580,00:04:57.970
"could be an indefinite
integral, an improper",00:04:57.970,00:05:00.540
"integral, a definite
integral, whatever.",00:05:00.540,00:05:01.950
But the boundary stays.,00:05:01.950,00:05:03.080
"And we can still say, from 0
to infinity of uv prime.",00:05:03.080,00:05:10.210
"So u is minus 1 over s e to the
minus st, times v prime,",00:05:10.210,00:05:20.800
"times a cosine of at--
fair enough-- dt.",00:05:20.800,00:05:32.350
"Well, now we have another hairy",00:05:32.350,00:05:33.720
integral we need to solve.,00:05:33.720,00:05:35.210
"So this might involve another
integration by",00:05:35.210,00:05:37.940
"parts, and it does.",00:05:37.940,00:05:42.360
"Let's see if we can simplify
it at [? all. ?]",00:05:42.360,00:05:43.890
"Let's take the constants
out first. Let me",00:05:43.890,00:05:45.340
just rewrite this.,00:05:45.340,00:05:46.890
"So we get y is equal to minus
e to the minus st",00:05:46.890,00:05:54.440
"over s, sine of at.",00:05:54.440,00:06:00.090
"So you have a minus minus plus a
over s-- a divided by s, and",00:06:00.090,00:06:09.700
"then these two negative signs
cancel out-- times the",00:06:09.700,00:06:12.250
"integral from 0 to infinity,
e to the minus st,",00:06:12.250,00:06:19.420
"cosine of at, dt.",00:06:19.420,00:06:23.080
"Let's do another integration
by parts.",00:06:23.080,00:06:25.110
"And I'll do this in a purple
color, just so you know this",00:06:25.110,00:06:27.250
"is our second integration
by parts.",00:06:27.250,00:06:29.520
Over here.,00:06:29.520,00:06:31.720
"Let's define once again, u prime
is equal to e the minus",00:06:31.720,00:06:40.670
st. So this is u prime.,00:06:40.670,00:06:43.550
"Then u is equal to minus 1
over s e to the minus st.",00:06:43.550,00:06:50.150
"We'll make v equal
to cosine of at.",00:06:50.150,00:06:53.010
 ,00:06:53.010,00:06:55.720
"The hardest part about this is
not making careless mistakes.",00:06:55.720,00:06:58.730
"And then v prime-- I just want
it to be on the same row-- is",00:06:58.730,00:07:02.590
"equal to minus a sine
of at, right?",00:07:02.590,00:07:09.560
"The chain rule, derivative
of cosine is minus sine.",00:07:09.560,00:07:12.160
"So let's substitute that back
in, and we get-- this is going",00:07:12.160,00:07:17.070
"to get hairy; actually, it
already is hairy-- y is equal",00:07:17.070,00:07:21.960
"to minus e to the minus st over
s, sine of at, plus a",00:07:21.960,00:07:35.620
"over s, times-- OK.",00:07:35.620,00:07:41.220
Integration by parts.,00:07:41.220,00:07:42.810
uv.,00:07:42.810,00:07:43.680
"So that's minus 1 over s e to
the minus st, times v, times",00:07:43.680,00:07:53.540
"cosine at, minus the integral
from 0 to infinity.",00:07:53.540,00:08:06.910
"This problem is making
me hungry.",00:08:06.910,00:08:08.310
"It's taking so much glucose
from my bloodstream.",00:08:08.310,00:08:10.800
"I'm focusing so much not to
make careless mistakes.",00:08:10.800,00:08:14.000
"Anyway, integral from
0 to infinity.",00:08:14.000,00:08:16.380
"And now, we have uv prime, so
u is minus 1 over s e to the",00:08:16.380,00:08:26.250
minus st. That's u.,00:08:26.250,00:08:30.460
"And then v prime
times minus a.",00:08:30.460,00:08:34.480
"So let's make that minus cancel
out with this one.",00:08:34.480,00:08:37.159
So that becomes a plus.,00:08:37.159,00:08:38.400
"a sine of at, dt.",00:08:38.400,00:08:46.860
"I'm starting to see the light
at the end of the tunnel.",00:08:46.860,00:08:49.170
"So then, let's simplify
this thing.",00:08:49.170,00:08:51.700
"And, of course, we're going to
have to evaluate this whole",00:08:51.700,00:08:53.610
"thing, right?",00:08:53.610,00:08:56.730
"Actually, we're going to have
to evaluate everything.",00:08:56.730,00:08:58.350
"Let's just focus on the
indefinite integral for now.",00:08:58.350,00:09:00.440
"We're going to have to take
this whole thing and",00:09:00.440,00:09:02.020
"evaluate-- let's just say that
y is the antiderivative and",00:09:02.020,00:09:05.180
"then evaluate it from
infinity to 0.",00:09:05.180,00:09:07.340
From 0 to infinity.,00:09:07.340,00:09:08.850
"So y is equal to minus
e to the minus st",00:09:08.850,00:09:15.125
"over s, sine of at.",00:09:15.125,00:09:19.072
Now let's distribute this.,00:09:19.072,00:09:21.690
"Minus a over s squared, e to
the minus st, cosine of at.",00:09:21.690,00:09:32.950
Right?,00:09:32.950,00:09:33.430
"OK, now I want to make sure I
don't make a careless mistake.",00:09:33.430,00:09:35.990
OK.,00:09:35.990,00:09:36.380
"Now, let's multiply this times
this and take all of the",00:09:36.380,00:09:39.390
constants out.,00:09:39.390,00:09:40.520
So we have an a and an s.,00:09:40.520,00:09:42.450
a over s.,00:09:42.450,00:09:43.790
There's a minus sign.,00:09:43.790,00:09:44.740
We have a plus a to the s.,00:09:44.740,00:09:46.470
"So we'll have a minus a squared
over s squared, times",00:09:46.470,00:09:56.740
"the integral from 0-- well, I
said I'm just worrying about",00:09:56.740,00:10:00.990
"the indefinite integral right
now, and we'll evaluate the",00:10:00.990,00:10:06.060
boundaries later.,00:10:06.060,00:10:07.680
"e to the minus st,
sine of at, dt.",00:10:07.680,00:10:13.760
"Now, this is the part, and we've
done this before, it's a",00:10:13.760,00:10:15.800
"little bit of a trick with
integration by parts.",00:10:15.800,00:10:18.580
"But this expression, notice,
is the same thing as our",00:10:18.580,00:10:22.500
original y.,00:10:22.500,00:10:23.940
Right?,00:10:23.940,00:10:24.400
This is our original y.,00:10:24.400,00:10:25.410
"And we're assuming we're doing
the indefinite integral, and",00:10:25.410,00:10:27.110
"we'll evaluate the
boundaries later.",00:10:27.110,00:10:28.340
"Although we could have kept the
boundaries the whole time,",00:10:28.340,00:10:30.440
"but it would have made
it even hairier.",00:10:30.440,00:10:32.120
"So we can rewrite this
integral as y.",00:10:32.120,00:10:34.440
That was our definition.,00:10:34.440,00:10:37.580
"And actually, I just realized
I'm running out of time, so",00:10:37.580,00:10:39.440
"I'll continue this hairy problem
in the next video.",00:10:39.440,00:10:42.010
See you soon.,00:10:42.010,00:10:43.260
