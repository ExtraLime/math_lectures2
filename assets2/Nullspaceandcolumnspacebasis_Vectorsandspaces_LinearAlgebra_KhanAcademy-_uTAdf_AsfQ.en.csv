"What I want to do in this video
-- and it'll probably",00:00:00.450,00:00:02.890
"occur over several videos -- is
really integrate everything",00:00:02.890,00:00:05.980
"we know about matrices, and
null spaces, and column",00:00:05.980,00:00:08.990
"spaces, and linear
independence.",00:00:08.990,00:00:11.960
"So I have this matrix
here, this matrix A.",00:00:11.960,00:00:15.100
"And I guess a good place to
start is, let's figure out its",00:00:15.100,00:00:17.510
"column space and
its null space.",00:00:17.510,00:00:19.380
"The column space is actually
super easy to figure out.",00:00:19.380,00:00:22.510
"It's just the span of the
column vectors of A.",00:00:22.510,00:00:25.070
"So we can right from the get-go
write that the column",00:00:25.070,00:00:27.940
"space of our matrix A-- Let
me do it over here.",00:00:27.940,00:00:34.240
"I can write the column space of
my matrix A is equal to the",00:00:34.240,00:00:38.700
"span of the vectors 1, 2, 3.",00:00:38.700,00:00:46.050
"1, 1, 4.",00:00:46.050,00:00:48.490
"1, 4, 1.",00:00:52.550,00:00:54.410
"And 1, 3, 2.",00:00:54.410,00:00:56.130
I'm done.,00:00:56.130,00:00:56.730
"That was pretty straightforward,
a lot easier",00:00:56.730,00:00:58.410
than finding null spaces.,00:00:58.410,00:01:00.290
"Now this may or may not
be satisfying to you.",00:01:00.290,00:01:03.220
"And there's a lot of
open questions.",00:01:03.220,00:01:04.660
"Is this a basis for the
space, for example?",00:01:04.660,00:01:07.940
"Is this a linear independent
set of vectors?",00:01:07.940,00:01:10.640
"How can we visualize
this space?",00:01:10.640,00:01:12.580
"And I haven't answered
any of those yet.",00:01:12.580,00:01:14.260
"But if someone just says, hey
what's the column space of A?",00:01:14.260,00:01:16.750
This is the column space of A.,00:01:16.750,00:01:18.460
"And then we can answer some
of those other questions.",00:01:18.460,00:01:20.090
"If this is a linearly
independent set of vectors,",00:01:23.390,00:01:27.330
"then these vectors would
be a basis for the",00:01:27.330,00:01:31.340
column space of A.,00:01:31.340,00:01:32.170
We don't know that yet.,00:01:32.170,00:01:33.040
"We don't know whether these
are linearly independent.",00:01:33.040,00:01:35.220
"But we can figure out if they're
linearly independent",00:01:35.220,00:01:37.700
"by looking at the
null space of A.",00:01:37.700,00:01:40.070
"Remember these are linearly
independent if the null space",00:01:40.070,00:01:42.530
"of A only contains
the 0 vector.",00:01:42.530,00:01:44.780
"So let's figure out what
the null space of A is.",00:01:44.780,00:01:47.110
"And remember, we can do a
little shortcut here.",00:01:47.110,00:01:49.190
"The null space of A is equal to
the null space of the row,",00:01:49.190,00:01:54.580
"the reduced row echelon
form of A.",00:01:54.580,00:01:58.140
"And I showed you that when we
first calculated the null",00:01:58.140,00:02:01.050
"space of a vector, because when
you performed these --",00:02:01.050,00:02:04.200
"essentially if you want to solve
for the null space of A,",00:02:04.200,00:02:06.580
"you create an augmented
matrix.",00:02:06.580,00:02:07.980
"And you put the augmented matrix
in reduced row echelon",00:02:07.980,00:02:11.490
"form, but the 0's
never change.",00:02:11.490,00:02:13.520
"So essentially you're just
taking A and putting it in",00:02:13.520,00:02:15.300
reduced row echelon form.,00:02:15.300,00:02:16.630
Let's do that.,00:02:16.630,00:02:18.340
"So I'll keep row one the
same, 1, 1, 1, 1.",00:02:18.340,00:02:25.250
"And then let me replace
row two with, row",00:02:25.250,00:02:28.570
two minus row one.,00:02:28.570,00:02:31.580
So what do I get?,00:02:34.390,00:02:36.510
"No, actually I want to
zero this out here.",00:02:36.510,00:02:39.120
"So row two minus,
2 times row one.",00:02:39.120,00:02:42.720
"Actually even better because
I eventually",00:02:42.720,00:02:44.130
want to get a 1 here.,00:02:44.130,00:02:44.950
"So let me do 2 times row
one, minus row two.",00:02:44.950,00:02:48.700
"So let me say 2 times row
one, and I'm going",00:02:48.700,00:02:52.150
to minus row two.,00:02:52.150,00:02:53.170
"So 2 times 1 minus 2 is
0, which is exactly",00:02:53.170,00:02:57.670
what I wanted there.,00:02:57.670,00:02:58.800
2 times 1 minus 1 is 1.,00:02:58.800,00:03:02.950
"That's nice to have
right there.",00:03:02.950,00:03:04.680
2 times 1 minus 4 is minus 2.,00:03:04.680,00:03:10.300
2 times 1 minus 3 is minus 1.,00:03:10.300,00:03:15.530
"All right, now let me see if I
can zero out this guy here.",00:03:15.530,00:03:20.240
So what can I do?,00:03:20.240,00:03:21.490
"I could do any combination,
anything that essentially",00:03:26.960,00:03:29.510
zeroes this guy out.,00:03:29.510,00:03:30.710
"But I want to minimize my number
of negative numbers.",00:03:30.710,00:03:33.640
"So let me take this third row,
minus 3 times this first row.",00:03:33.640,00:03:38.590
"So I'm going take minus 3 times
that first row and add",00:03:38.590,00:03:43.060
it to this third row.,00:03:43.060,00:03:45.250
So 3 minus 3 times 1 is 0.,00:03:45.250,00:03:49.336
"These are just going to
be a bunch of 3's.",00:03:52.250,00:03:53.370
4 minus 3 times 1 is 1.,00:03:53.370,00:03:55.920
1 minus 3 times 1 is minus 2.,00:03:55.920,00:03:58.990
"And 2 minus 3 times
1 is minus 1.",00:03:58.990,00:04:02.510
"Now if we want to get this into
reduced row echelon form",00:04:02.510,00:04:05.290
"we need to target that one
there and that one there.",00:04:05.290,00:04:08.970
And what can we do?,00:04:08.970,00:04:09.870
"So let's keep my middle
row the same.",00:04:09.870,00:04:13.270
"My middle row is not
going to change.",00:04:13.270,00:04:16.000
"1, 1, minus 2, minus 1.",00:04:16.000,00:04:21.610
"And to get rid of this one up
here I can just replace my",00:04:21.610,00:04:24.550
"first row with my first row
minus my second row.",00:04:24.550,00:04:27.950
"Because then this
won't change.",00:04:27.950,00:04:29.460
I'll have 1 minus 0 is 1.,00:04:29.460,00:04:31.370
1 minus 1 is 0.,00:04:31.370,00:04:33.280
That's what we wanted.,00:04:33.280,00:04:34.140
1 minus minus 2 is 3.,00:04:34.140,00:04:39.210
That's 1 plus 2.,00:04:39.210,00:04:40.120
1 minus minus 1.,00:04:40.120,00:04:42.060
That's 1 plus 1.,00:04:42.060,00:04:43.000
That is 2.,00:04:43.000,00:04:44.700
Fair enough?,00:04:44.700,00:04:45.690
Now let me do my third row.,00:04:45.690,00:04:47.805
"Let me replace my third row with
my third row subtracted",00:04:51.950,00:04:55.000
from my first row.,00:04:55.000,00:04:56.190
"They are obviously
the same thing.",00:04:56.190,00:04:57.240
"So if I subtract the third row
from the second row I'm just",00:04:57.240,00:05:01.220
going to get a bunch of 0's.,00:05:01.220,00:05:02.260
0 minus 0 is 0.,00:05:02.260,00:05:04.610
1 minus 1 is 0.,00:05:04.610,00:05:07.060
Minus 2 minus minus 2 is 0.,00:05:07.060,00:05:11.500
And minus 1 minus minus 1.,00:05:11.500,00:05:13.070
That's minus 1 plus 1.,00:05:13.070,00:05:14.430
That's equal to 0.,00:05:14.430,00:05:16.020
"And just like that
we have it now in",00:05:16.020,00:05:17.900
reduced row echelon form.,00:05:17.900,00:05:19.480
"So this right here is the
reduced row echelon form of A.",00:05:19.480,00:05:24.690
That straightforward.,00:05:24.690,00:05:26.030
"Now the whole the reason why
we even went through this",00:05:26.030,00:05:29.450
"exercise is we wanted
to figure out the",00:05:29.450,00:05:31.460
null space of A.,00:05:31.460,00:05:32.460
"And we already know that the
null space of A is equal to",00:05:32.460,00:05:34.740
"the null space of the reduced
row echelon form of A.",00:05:34.740,00:05:38.400
"So if this is the reduce row
echelon form of A, let's",00:05:38.400,00:05:41.360
figure out its null space.,00:05:41.360,00:05:42.930
"So the null space is the set
of all of vectors in R4,",00:05:42.930,00:05:48.030
"because we have 4
columns here.",00:05:48.030,00:05:50.170
"1, 2, 3, 4.",00:05:50.170,00:05:54.170
"The null space is the set of
all of vectors that satisfy",00:05:54.170,00:05:57.380
"this equation, where
we're going to have",00:05:57.380,00:05:59.780
three 0's right here.,00:05:59.780,00:06:01.770
"That's the 0 vector in R3,
because we have three rows",00:06:01.770,00:06:04.570
"right there, and you
can figure it out.",00:06:04.570,00:06:06.250
"This times this has
to equal that 0.",00:06:06.250,00:06:08.760
"That dotted with that
essentially is going",00:06:08.760,00:06:10.745
to equal that 0.,00:06:10.745,00:06:11.780
"That dotted with that
is equal to that 0.",00:06:11.780,00:06:13.600
"I say essentially because I
didn't define a row vector dot",00:06:13.600,00:06:17.970
a column vector.,00:06:17.970,00:06:19.340
"I've only defined column vectors
dotted with other",00:06:19.340,00:06:21.410
column vectors.,00:06:21.410,00:06:21.850
"But we've been over that in a
previous video, where you can",00:06:21.850,00:06:24.320
"say this is a transpose
of a column vector.",00:06:24.320,00:06:27.720
"So let's just take this,
and write a system of",00:06:27.720,00:06:29.800
equations with this.,00:06:29.800,00:06:31.290
So we get 1 times x1.,00:06:31.290,00:06:34.480
"So this times this is going
to be equal to that 0.",00:06:34.480,00:06:37.840
"So one times x1, that is x1.",00:06:37.840,00:06:41.740
Plus 0 times x2.,00:06:41.740,00:06:44.330
Let me just write that out.,00:06:44.330,00:06:46.500
Plus 3 times x3.,00:06:46.500,00:06:49.740
"Plus 2 times x4 is
equal to that 0.",00:06:49.740,00:06:55.870
"And then -- I'll do it in
yellow right here -- I",00:06:55.870,00:06:59.730
have 0 times x1.,00:06:59.730,00:07:03.200
Plus 1 times x2.,00:07:03.200,00:07:07.410
Minus 2 times x3.,00:07:07.410,00:07:10.450
Minus x4 is equal to 0.,00:07:10.450,00:07:14.040
"And then this gives
me no information.",00:07:14.040,00:07:15.440
"0 times all this
is equal to 0.",00:07:15.440,00:07:17.400
"So it just turns into
0 equals 0.",00:07:17.400,00:07:19.540
"So let's see if we can solve for
our pivot entries, or our",00:07:19.540,00:07:22.640
pivot variables.,00:07:22.640,00:07:23.570
What are our pivot entries?,00:07:23.570,00:07:24.930
This is a pivot entry.,00:07:24.930,00:07:26.160
That's a pivot entry.,00:07:26.160,00:07:27.470
"That's what reduced row echelon
form is all about,",00:07:27.470,00:07:29.730
"getting these entries that are
1 and they're the only",00:07:29.730,00:07:31.740
"non-zero term in their
respective columns.",00:07:31.740,00:07:34.860
"And that every pivot entry
is to the right of a",00:07:34.860,00:07:37.060
pivot entry above it.,00:07:37.060,00:07:38.370
"And then the columns that don't
have pivot entries?",00:07:38.370,00:07:42.140
"These columns represent
the free variables.",00:07:42.140,00:07:45.210
"So this column has
no pivot entry.",00:07:45.210,00:07:48.260
"And so when you take the dot
product, this column turned",00:07:48.260,00:07:51.610
"into this column in our
system of equations.",00:07:51.610,00:07:54.290
"So we know that x3 is
a free variable.",00:07:54.290,00:07:57.190
x3 is free.,00:07:57.190,00:07:58.890
"We can set it equal
to anything.",00:07:58.890,00:08:00.730
"Likewise x4 is a
free variable.",00:08:00.730,00:08:07.690
"X1 and x2 are pivot variables,
because their corresponding",00:08:07.690,00:08:11.140
"columns in our reduced row
echelon form have pivot",00:08:11.140,00:08:14.360
entries in them.,00:08:14.360,00:08:15.500
Fair enough.,00:08:15.500,00:08:16.140
"So let's see if we
can simplify this",00:08:16.140,00:08:17.580
into a form we know.,00:08:17.580,00:08:18.920
And we've seen this before.,00:08:18.920,00:08:21.440
"So if I solve for x1 --
this 0 I can ignore.",00:08:21.440,00:08:25.080
"That 0 I can ignore -- I could
say that x1 is equal to minus",00:08:25.080,00:08:32.000
3x3 minus 2x4.,00:08:32.000,00:08:36.650
"I just subtracted these two
from both sides of the",00:08:36.650,00:08:38.856
"equation and I can say that x2
is equal to 2x3 plus x4.",00:08:38.856,00:08:49.720
"And if we want to write our
solution set now, so if I",00:08:49.720,00:08:52.750
"wanted to find the null space of
A, which is the same thing",00:08:52.750,00:09:00.540
"as the null space of the reduced
row echelon form of A,",00:09:00.540,00:09:05.400
"is equal to all of the vectors
-- let me do a new color.",00:09:05.400,00:09:09.730
"Maybe I'll do blue -- is equal
to all of the vectors x1, x2,",00:09:09.730,00:09:15.050
"x3, x4 that are equal to --",00:09:15.050,00:09:19.070
"So what are they going
to be equal to?",00:09:19.070,00:09:20.620
"X1 has to be equal to
minus 3x3 minus 2x4.",00:09:20.620,00:09:24.390
"Just to be clear, these are free
variables because I can",00:09:24.390,00:09:26.440
set these to be anything.,00:09:26.440,00:09:28.490
"And these are pivot variables
because I can't just set them",00:09:28.490,00:09:30.560
to anything.,00:09:30.560,00:09:31.450
"When I determine what my x3's
and my x4's are, they",00:09:31.450,00:09:34.390
"determine what my x1's and
my x2's have to be.",00:09:34.390,00:09:37.060
"So these are pivoted
variables.",00:09:37.060,00:09:38.350
These are free variables.,00:09:38.350,00:09:39.470
I can make this guy pi.,00:09:39.470,00:09:40.750
"And I can make this
guy minus 2.",00:09:40.750,00:09:42.830
We can set them to anything.,00:09:42.830,00:09:44.680
"So x1 is equal to -- let's see,
let me write it this way",00:09:44.680,00:09:47.805
"-- they're equal to x3 -- let me
do it in a different color",00:09:47.805,00:09:51.655
-- do x3 like this.,00:09:51.655,00:09:53.850
"So it's equal to x3 times some
vector plus x4 times some",00:09:53.850,00:10:04.420
other vector.,00:10:04.420,00:10:06.080
"So any solution set in my null
space is going to be a linear",00:10:06.080,00:10:08.910
"combination of these
two vectors.",00:10:08.910,00:10:10.240
"We can figure out what these
two vectors are just from",00:10:10.240,00:10:13.230
"these two constraints
right here.",00:10:13.230,00:10:16.830
"So -- let me do it in a neutral
color -- x1 is equal",00:10:16.830,00:10:22.910
"to minus 3 times x3
minus 2 times x4.",00:10:22.910,00:10:29.460
Straightforward enough.,00:10:29.460,00:10:30.980
"x2 is equal to 2 times
x3 plus x4.",00:10:30.980,00:10:37.500
What's x3 equal to?,00:10:37.500,00:10:39.410
Well x3 is equal to itself.,00:10:39.410,00:10:40.690
"Whatever we set x3 equal to,
that's going to be x3.",00:10:40.690,00:10:42.870
"So x3 is going to be 1 times
x3 plus 0 times x4.",00:10:42.870,00:10:47.200
"It is not going to have
any x4 in it.",00:10:47.200,00:10:48.580
"X3 is going to be kind of
an independent variable.",00:10:48.580,00:10:51.460
It's going to be free.,00:10:51.460,00:10:52.200
We can set whatever it is.,00:10:52.200,00:10:53.390
"We set it and then that's
going to be x3 in",00:10:53.390,00:10:55.240
our solution set.,00:10:55.240,00:10:56.900
"x4 is not going to have
any x3 in it.",00:10:56.900,00:10:58.990
"It's just going to
be 1 times x4.",00:10:58.990,00:11:01.140
"And so our null space is
essentially all of the linear",00:11:01.140,00:11:03.980
"combinations of these
two vectors.",00:11:03.980,00:11:06.410
This can be any real number.,00:11:06.410,00:11:07.740
"This is just any real number and
x4 is just a member of the",00:11:07.740,00:11:12.420
real space.,00:11:12.420,00:11:13.140
"So all of these, the set of all
of the valid solutions to",00:11:13.140,00:11:18.700
"Ax is equal to 0 -- where
did I write that.",00:11:18.700,00:11:21.220
Did I even write that down?,00:11:21.220,00:11:22.300
"No I haven't even written
that anywhere.",00:11:22.300,00:11:23.930
"The set of all Ax is equal to
0, where this is my x, it",00:11:23.930,00:11:29.130
"equals all the linear
combinations of this vector",00:11:29.130,00:11:33.250
and that vector right there.,00:11:33.250,00:11:34.590
"And we know what all of the
linear combinations mean.",00:11:34.590,00:11:37.540
"It means my null space is equal
to the span of these two",00:11:37.540,00:11:45.460
"guys, the span of minus
3, 2, 1, 0.",00:11:45.460,00:11:51.230
"And minus 2, 1, 0, 1.",00:11:51.230,00:12:00.500
Now let me ask you a question.,00:12:00.500,00:12:02.675
"Are the columns in A, are they
a linearly independent set?",00:12:08.030,00:12:13.070
"Are they a linearly
independent set?",00:12:13.070,00:12:16.980
"So if we write these vectors
right there, these are the",00:12:16.980,00:12:22.100
column vectors of A.,00:12:22.100,00:12:24.170
So let me write that down.,00:12:24.170,00:12:25.220
"So are the column vectors of
A -- so what were they?",00:12:25.220,00:12:29.400
Let's see.,00:12:29.400,00:12:29.790
"1, 3, 2.",00:12:29.790,00:12:34.750
"No it's 1, 2, 3.",00:12:34.750,00:12:36.380
"1, 1, 4.",00:12:40.480,00:12:44.740
"1, 4, 1.",00:12:44.740,00:12:47.350
"And 1, 3, 2.",00:12:47.350,00:12:50.260
"So this is just the column
vectors of A.",00:12:50.260,00:12:51.770
"I could just write A is just
this much of columns, but my",00:12:51.770,00:12:54.600
"question is, is this a linearly
independent set?",00:12:54.600,00:12:57.940
"And here you might immediately
start thinking, well when we",00:13:04.620,00:13:08.690
"said that something is linearly
independent -- so",00:13:08.690,00:13:11.010
"linearly independence implies
that there's only one solution",00:13:11.010,00:13:19.485
"-- we saw this I think two
videos ago, that there's only",00:13:19.485,00:13:22.010
"one solution -- one solution
to Ax is equal to 0.",00:13:22.010,00:13:31.100
"And that is the 0 solution,
that x is",00:13:31.100,00:13:33.710
equal to the 0 vector.,00:13:33.710,00:13:35.550
"Or another way to say that is
that the null space of my",00:13:35.550,00:13:40.020
"matrix A is equal to
just the 0 vector.",00:13:40.020,00:13:44.840
"That's what linear independence
implies.",00:13:44.840,00:13:46.220
And it goes both ways.,00:13:46.220,00:13:47.430
"If my null space is just a 0
vector, then I know it's",00:13:47.430,00:13:50.160
linearly independent.,00:13:50.160,00:13:51.430
"If my null space includes other
vectors, then I am not",00:13:51.430,00:13:54.800
linearly independent.,00:13:54.800,00:13:56.180
"Now my null space of A,
what does it include?",00:13:56.180,00:13:58.400
Is it just the 0 vector?,00:13:58.400,00:14:00.080
"Well, no it includes
every linear",00:14:00.080,00:14:01.810
combination of these guys.,00:14:01.810,00:14:03.200
"It includes actually an infinite
number of vectors,",00:14:03.200,00:14:05.590
not just one solution.,00:14:05.590,00:14:07.110
"Obviously 0 vector is contained
here, if you just",00:14:07.110,00:14:09.180
"multiply both of these -- if you
pick 0 for that and that.",00:14:09.180,00:14:11.950
"It's contained, but you can get
a whole set of vectors.",00:14:11.950,00:14:14.820
"So because the null span of A,
the null space, sorry, the",00:14:14.820,00:14:25.850
"null space of A does not just
contain the 0 vector.",00:14:25.850,00:14:29.720
So it has more than just 0.,00:14:29.720,00:14:33.730
So what does that mean?,00:14:37.510,00:14:38.950
"Well that means that
there's more than",00:14:38.950,00:14:40.170
one solution to this.,00:14:40.170,00:14:41.300
"And that means that this is
a linearly dependent set.",00:14:41.300,00:14:44.220
And what does that mean?,00:14:51.620,00:14:52.950
"At the very beginning of the
video I said, what's the",00:14:52.950,00:14:54.940
column space of A.,00:14:54.940,00:14:56.250
"And we said, the column space
of A is just the span of the",00:14:56.250,00:14:59.400
column vectors.,00:14:59.400,00:15:00.490
I just wrote it out like that.,00:15:00.490,00:15:01.950
"And I said, well it's not clear
whether this is a valid",00:15:01.950,00:15:04.410
"basis for the column
space of A.",00:15:04.410,00:15:06.680
And what's a basis?,00:15:06.680,00:15:07.630
"A basis is a set of vectors that
span a subspace, and they",00:15:07.630,00:15:13.590
are also linearly independent.,00:15:13.590,00:15:14.970
"And we just showed that these
guys are not linearly",00:15:14.970,00:15:19.230
independent.,00:15:19.230,00:15:21.910
"So that means that they are
not a basis for the column",00:15:21.910,00:15:28.070
space of A.,00:15:28.070,00:15:30.360
"They do span the column space
of A, by definition really.",00:15:30.360,00:15:33.720
But they're not a basis.,00:15:33.720,00:15:34.780
"They need to be linearly
independent for",00:15:34.780,00:15:36.620
them to be a basis.,00:15:36.620,00:15:38.020
"So let's see if we can figure
out what a basis for this",00:15:38.020,00:15:41.120
column space would be.,00:15:41.120,00:15:42.040
"And to do that we just
have to get rid of",00:15:42.040,00:15:44.000
some redundant vectors.,00:15:44.000,00:15:45.380
"If I can show you that this guy
can be represented by some",00:15:45.380,00:15:49.340
"combination of these two
guys, then I can",00:15:49.340,00:15:50.810
get rid of that guy.,00:15:50.810,00:15:51.650
"He's not adding any
new information.",00:15:51.650,00:15:53.480
Same with that guy.,00:15:53.480,00:15:54.370
Who knows?,00:15:54.370,00:15:55.400
"So let's see if we can figure
this piece of the puzzle out.",00:15:55.400,00:15:59.890
"So we know already that x1, let
me write it this way, that",00:15:59.890,00:16:06.770
"x1 times -- Maybe I'll just kind
of leave you hanging and",00:16:06.770,00:16:11.010
"continue this in
the next video.",00:16:11.010,00:16:12.270
"But we know that x1
times 1, 2, 3.",00:16:12.270,00:16:18.780
"Plus x2 times 1, 1, 4.",00:16:18.780,00:16:23.470
"Plus x3 times 1, 4, 1.",00:16:23.470,00:16:28.040
"Plus x4 times 1, 3, 2.",00:16:28.040,00:16:32.250
"We know that this
is equal to 0.",00:16:32.250,00:16:35.600
"Now if we are able to solve for
x4 in terms of -- let me",00:16:35.600,00:16:41.260
"just think that I can solve
for the vectors that are",00:16:41.260,00:16:47.540
"associated with my
free variables",00:16:47.540,00:16:49.300
using the other vectors.,00:16:49.300,00:16:50.600
Let me see if I can do that.,00:16:50.600,00:16:52.080
"And you'll see it's actually
pretty straightforward.",00:16:52.080,00:16:55.060
"So let's say I want
to solve for x4.",00:16:55.060,00:16:58.820
"So if I subtract this from
both sides of this",00:16:58.820,00:17:01.450
"equation, I get what?",00:17:01.450,00:17:04.819
"Let me put it this way, let
me set x3 equal to 0.",00:17:04.819,00:17:07.690
It was a free variable.,00:17:07.690,00:17:08.640
I can do that.,00:17:08.640,00:17:09.290
"So if I set x3 is equal to 0,
then what do I get here?",00:17:09.290,00:17:16.290
"If I said x3 equals 0,
this guy disappears.",00:17:16.290,00:17:18.710
"And if I subtract this from both
sides of this equation, I",00:17:18.710,00:17:21.780
"get x1 times 1, 2, 3.",00:17:21.780,00:17:27.230
"Plus x2 times 1, 1, 4.",00:17:27.230,00:17:31.940
"Is equal to -- I'm just
setting x3 equal to 0.",00:17:31.940,00:17:34.430
That was a free variable.,00:17:34.430,00:17:35.880
So I'm setting x3 equal to 0.,00:17:35.880,00:17:36.930
"So this whole thing
disappears.",00:17:36.930,00:17:38.940
"So that is equal to minus
x4 times 1, 3, 2.",00:17:38.940,00:17:47.490
Now I set x3 equal to 0.,00:17:47.490,00:17:48.900
"Let me set x4 to be
equal to minus 1.",00:17:48.900,00:17:55.050
"If x4 is equal to minus
1, what is minus x4?",00:17:55.050,00:17:58.440
"Well then this thing will
just be equal to 1.",00:17:58.440,00:18:01.300
"And I'll have x1
times 1, 2, 3.",00:18:01.300,00:18:03.500
"Plus x2 times 1, 1, 4 will
equal this fourth",00:18:03.500,00:18:07.560
vector right here.,00:18:07.560,00:18:08.980
"And can I always find
things like this?",00:18:08.980,00:18:11.350
"Well sure I can actually find
the particular ones.",00:18:11.350,00:18:13.250
"If x3 is equal to 0, and x4 is
minus 1 -- Let me copy and",00:18:13.250,00:18:17.340
"paste this that I have up
here -- Let me scroll",00:18:17.340,00:18:35.790
down a little bit.,00:18:35.790,00:18:37.000
"This is what we got when we
figured out our null space,",00:18:37.000,00:18:39.890
right there.,00:18:39.890,00:18:41.440
"So if I'm setting -- remember
these are the free variables",00:18:41.440,00:18:44.582
"-- if I set x3 equal to
0 and x4 is equal to",00:18:44.582,00:18:47.590
"minus 1, what is x1?",00:18:47.590,00:18:50.070
"Then this will imply that x1 is
equal to minus 3 times x3,",00:18:50.070,00:18:54.700
"that's just 0, minus
2 times x4.",00:18:54.700,00:18:58.350
"If x4 is minus 1, minus
2 times minus 1,",00:18:58.350,00:19:01.450
x1 will equal 2.,00:19:01.450,00:19:02.820
"And then what will
x2 be equal to?",00:19:02.820,00:19:05.350
"x2 is equal to 2 times x3,
which is 0, plus x4.",00:19:05.350,00:19:10.370
So it's equal to minus 1.,00:19:10.370,00:19:12.010
"So I just showed you that if I
set this equal to 2 and this",00:19:12.010,00:19:15.450
"equal to minus 1, I have a
linear combination of this",00:19:15.450,00:19:19.000
"vector and this vector
that can add up",00:19:19.000,00:19:21.340
to this fourth vector.,00:19:21.340,00:19:22.190
And you can even verify it.,00:19:22.190,00:19:23.140
"2 times 1 minus 1
is equal to 1.",00:19:23.140,00:19:25.430
"2 times 2 minus 1
is equal to 3.",00:19:25.430,00:19:29.290
"2 times 3 is 6, minus
4 is equal to 2.",00:19:29.290,00:19:32.340
So it checks out.,00:19:32.340,00:19:33.520
"So I just showed you using,
really, our definitions",00:19:33.520,00:19:37.820
"looking at what were
our free variables",00:19:37.820,00:19:40.730
versus our pivot variables.,00:19:40.730,00:19:42.110
"We were able to show you, kind
of just very simply solve for",00:19:42.110,00:19:46.210
"this third, this fourth
vector, in terms",00:19:46.210,00:19:48.310
of these first two.,00:19:48.310,00:19:49.540
"So we know, if we go back to
the set that this fourth",00:19:49.540,00:19:52.860
"vector is really unnecessary,
really not adding anything to",00:19:52.860,00:19:58.430
"the span of the set
of vectors.",00:19:58.430,00:20:00.330
"Because this guy can be written
as a combination of",00:20:00.330,00:20:02.910
this guy and this guy.,00:20:02.910,00:20:04.730
"Now let's see if this guy, this
third guy, we can do the",00:20:04.730,00:20:07.320
same exercise.,00:20:07.320,00:20:08.340
"This is also dictated
by a free variable.",00:20:08.340,00:20:10.350
"So let's see if I can write
him as a combination",00:20:10.350,00:20:11.990
of these first two.,00:20:11.990,00:20:13.430
"Well we'll do the exact
same thing.",00:20:13.430,00:20:15.450
"Instead of setting x3 equal to 0
and x4 equal to minus 1, let",00:20:15.450,00:20:22.030
"us set x4 is equal to
0 because I want",00:20:22.030,00:20:27.445
to cross that out.,00:20:27.445,00:20:28.760
"And let me set x3 is
equal to minus 1.",00:20:28.760,00:20:33.000
"If x3 is equal to minus
1, what does this",00:20:33.000,00:20:38.360
equation reduce to?,00:20:38.360,00:20:39.900
"We get x1 times 1, 2, 3.",00:20:39.900,00:20:44.480
"Plus x2 times 1, 1, 4.",00:20:44.480,00:20:48.760
"Is equal to -- if this is
minus 1 times 1, 4, 1.",00:20:48.760,00:20:51.640
"And then we add it to both sides
of this equation, we get",00:20:51.640,00:20:54.620
"plus 1 times 1, 4, 1.",00:20:54.620,00:20:58.960
"And once again we can just
solve for our x1 and x2.",00:20:58.960,00:21:01.710
"If x4 is 0 and x3 is minus
1, then x1 x4 is 0.",00:21:01.710,00:21:06.940
"So x3 is just minus 3,
times x3, so x1 would",00:21:06.940,00:21:10.220
"be equal to 3, right?",00:21:10.220,00:21:11.430
Minus 3 times minus 1.,00:21:11.430,00:21:13.950
And what would x2 be equal to?,00:21:13.950,00:21:16.120
"x4 is 0, we can ignore that.",00:21:16.120,00:21:17.730
x2 would be equal to minus 2.,00:21:17.730,00:21:19.700
"So this would be 3, and then
this would be minus 2.",00:21:19.700,00:21:23.250
Let's see if it works out.,00:21:23.250,00:21:23.830
3 times 1 minus 2 is 1.,00:21:23.830,00:21:26.500
3 times 2 minus 2 is 4.,00:21:26.500,00:21:28.620
3 times 3 minus 8 is 1.,00:21:28.620,00:21:30.620
It checks out.,00:21:30.620,00:21:31.800
"So I'm able to write this
vector, that was associated",00:21:31.800,00:21:35.120
"with the free variable,
as a linear",00:21:35.120,00:21:36.980
combination of these two.,00:21:36.980,00:21:39.180
"So we can get rid of
him from our set.",00:21:39.180,00:21:41.990
"So now I've shown that this guy
can be written as a linear",00:21:41.990,00:21:44.290
combination of these two.,00:21:44.290,00:21:45.240
"This guy can be written
as a linear",00:21:45.240,00:21:46.880
combination of these two.,00:21:46.880,00:21:47.690
"So the span of all of those guys
should be equal to the",00:21:47.690,00:21:51.710
"span -- So let me write
it this way.",00:21:51.710,00:21:54.120
"The column space of A,
I can now re-write.",00:21:56.690,00:22:00.630
"Before it was the span of
all of those vectors.",00:22:00.630,00:22:02.520
"It was the span of all of
the column vectors,",00:22:02.520,00:22:05.150
"v1, v2, v3, and v4.",00:22:05.150,00:22:10.850
"Now I just showed you that v3
and v4 can be rewritten in",00:22:10.850,00:22:13.470
terms of v1 and v2.,00:22:13.470,00:22:15.240
So they're redundant.,00:22:15.240,00:22:16.160
"So that is equal to the span
of v1 and v2 which are just",00:22:16.160,00:22:20.270
those two vectors.,00:22:20.270,00:22:23.140
"Vector 1, 2, 3, and
vector 1, 1, 4.",00:22:23.140,00:22:29.450
"Now are any of these
guys redundant?",00:22:29.450,00:22:32.800
"Can I express one of
them as a linear",00:22:32.800,00:22:35.150
combination of the other?,00:22:35.150,00:22:36.690
"Essentially when I'm talking
about the linear combination",00:22:36.690,00:22:38.250
"of only one other
vector it's just",00:22:38.250,00:22:39.550
multiplying it by a scalar.,00:22:39.550,00:22:40.930
Well let's think about that.,00:22:40.930,00:22:43.330
"There are multiple ways you can
show this, but the easiest",00:22:43.330,00:22:45.510
"way is well look, to go from
this entry to that entry I'm",00:22:45.510,00:22:48.730
just multiplying by 1.,00:22:48.730,00:22:50.320
"But if I multiply this whole
vector times 1, then I'm going",00:22:50.320,00:22:53.525
"to get a 2 here and I'm
going to get a 3 here.",00:22:53.525,00:22:55.980
So it won't work.,00:22:55.980,00:22:57.230
"If I want to represent this guy
as a scalar multiple of",00:22:59.840,00:23:01.940
"that guy, so any scalar multiple
of 1, 2, 3 is going",00:23:01.940,00:23:05.960
"to be equal to 1c, 2c, 3c.",00:23:05.960,00:23:14.810
Right?,00:23:14.810,00:23:15.460
"And so we're saying this guy has
to be represented somehow",00:23:15.460,00:23:18.030
"like that, if we say that this
guy is somehow a scalar,",00:23:18.030,00:23:21.110
"somehow can be represented
by that guy.",00:23:21.110,00:23:22.580
"So that would have to
be equal to 1, 1, 4.",00:23:22.580,00:23:26.600
"When you look at this top entry
it implies that c would",00:23:26.600,00:23:29.250
have to be equal to 1.,00:23:29.250,00:23:31.940
"But when you look at this second
entry you think that c",00:23:31.940,00:23:34.150
would have to be equal to 1/2.,00:23:34.150,00:23:37.020
So you get a contradiction.,00:23:37.020,00:23:38.030
"Over here c would have
to be equal to 4/3.",00:23:38.030,00:23:40.390
"So there's no c where
this will work.",00:23:40.390,00:23:42.530
There's no multiple of c.,00:23:42.530,00:23:43.740
"And you can work
that both ways.",00:23:43.740,00:23:45.650
"So there's no way that you can
represent one of these guys as",00:23:45.650,00:23:48.240
"a linear combination
of the other.",00:23:48.240,00:23:49.560
"And you can actually prove
other ways, maybe more",00:23:49.560,00:23:52.040
"formally, that this is
linearly independent.",00:23:52.040,00:23:54.120
"But given that this is linearly
independent -- I",00:23:54.120,00:23:55.810
"think you're satisfied with that
-- we can then say that",00:23:55.810,00:24:01.710
"the set of vectors 1, 2, 3, and
1, 1, 4, this is a basis",00:24:01.710,00:24:19.820
for the column span of A.,00:24:19.820,00:24:23.720
"Now I'm going to let you go in
this video because I think",00:24:23.720,00:24:26.000
I've gone well over time.,00:24:26.000,00:24:27.200
"But what I'm going to do in
the next few videos is now",00:24:27.200,00:24:28.870
"that I've established that this
is a basis for the column",00:24:28.870,00:24:32.180
"span of A, we can attempt
to visualize it.",00:24:32.180,00:24:34.780
"Because we can say that the
column span of A is equal to",00:24:34.780,00:24:39.140
the span of these two vectors.,00:24:39.140,00:24:42.100
"And we can think about
what the span of",00:24:42.100,00:24:43.840
those two vectors are.,00:24:43.840,00:24:44.850
"We're going to see that
it's a plane in R3.",00:24:44.850,00:24:47.280
"Span of 1, 1, 4.",00:24:47.280,00:24:49.180
"And this is a quick reminder,
I've said a couple times.",00:24:49.180,00:24:50.910
"When I say it's a basis all I'm
saying is that these guys,",00:24:50.910,00:24:53.760
"they both span the column
space of A.",00:24:53.760,00:24:56.510
"When I had four vectors,
they also spanned the",00:24:56.510,00:24:58.275
column space of A.,00:24:58.275,00:24:59.190
"But what makes them a basis is
that these guys are linearly",00:24:59.190,00:25:02.460
independent.,00:25:02.460,00:25:02.980
"There's no extra information, or
redundant vectors that can",00:25:02.980,00:25:05.910
"be represented by other vectors
within the basis.",00:25:05.910,00:25:09.260
They are linearly independent.,00:25:09.260,00:25:10.360
"Anyway, I'll let
you go for now.",00:25:10.360,00:25:12.510
