"In the last video, we started
with a linear transformation",00:00:00.530,00:00:04.180
"S, that was a mapping between
the set x, that was a subset",00:00:04.180,00:00:08.520
of Rn to the set y.,00:00:08.520,00:00:10.510
"And then we had another
transformation that was a",00:00:10.510,00:00:12.390
"mapping from the set
y to the set z.",00:00:12.390,00:00:15.540
"And we asked ourselves,
given these two linear",00:00:15.540,00:00:18.060
"transformations, could
we construct a linear",00:00:18.060,00:00:20.900
"transformation that goes all
the way from x to z?",00:00:20.900,00:00:26.320
"What we did was we made
a definition.",00:00:26.320,00:00:27.780
"We said let's create something
called the",00:00:27.780,00:00:30.820
composition of T with S.,00:00:30.820,00:00:33.290
"What that is, is first you apply
S to some vector in X to",00:00:33.290,00:00:37.180
get some vector in Y.,00:00:37.180,00:00:38.535
"And that's your vector
right there.",00:00:38.535,00:00:40.990
"And then you apply T to
that, to get to z.",00:00:40.990,00:00:44.090
And so we defined it that way.,00:00:44.090,00:00:45.720
"And our next question was, was
that a linear transformation?",00:00:45.720,00:00:48.420
We show that it was.,00:00:48.420,00:00:49.890
"It met the two requirements
for them.",00:00:49.890,00:00:52.010
"And because it is a linear
transformation, I left off in",00:00:52.010,00:00:54.620
"the last video saying that
it should be able to be",00:00:54.620,00:00:57.440
"represented by some matrix
vector product.",00:00:57.440,00:01:00.870
"Where this will have to
be an l by n matrix.",00:01:00.870,00:01:03.440
"Because it's a mapping from an n
dimensional space, which was",00:01:03.440,00:01:06.690
"x-- it was a subset of Rn--
to an l dimensional space.",00:01:06.690,00:01:12.300
"Because z is a subset of Rl Now
in this video, let's try",00:01:12.300,00:01:16.860
"to actually construct
this matrix.",00:01:16.860,00:01:20.340
"So at the beginning of the last
video, I told you that T",00:01:20.340,00:01:24.130
"of x could be written as some
matrix product, B times x.",00:01:24.130,00:01:28.050
"Let me write that and rewrite
it down here.",00:01:28.050,00:01:32.170
"So I told you that the linear
transformation T applied to",00:01:32.170,00:01:36.090
"some vector x, could be written
as the matrix vector",00:01:36.090,00:01:39.900
"product, B times a vector x.",00:01:39.900,00:01:43.410
"And since it was a mapping from
an m dimensional space to",00:01:43.410,00:01:49.540
"an l dimensional space, we know
this is going to be in l",00:01:49.540,00:01:53.170
by m matrix.,00:01:53.170,00:01:58.800
"Now similarly, I told you that
the transformation S can also",00:01:58.800,00:02:04.000
"be written as a matrix
vector product.",00:02:04.000,00:02:06.780
"Where we can say A is its
matrix representation",00:02:06.780,00:02:09.729
times a vector x.,00:02:09.729,00:02:11.160
"And since S was a mapping from
an n dimensional space to an m",00:02:11.160,00:02:18.060
"dimensional space, this will
be an m by n matrix.",00:02:18.060,00:02:21.950
"Now by definition, what was the
composition of T with S?",00:02:25.780,00:02:32.600
What is this?,00:02:32.600,00:02:33.460
"By definition, we said that this
is equal to-- you first",00:02:33.460,00:02:36.680
"apply the linear transformation
S to x.",00:02:36.680,00:02:40.590
"And I'll arbitrarily
switch colors.",00:02:40.590,00:02:42.890
"So you first apply the
transformation S to x.",00:02:42.890,00:02:46.000
"And that essentially gets you
a vector right there.",00:02:46.000,00:02:50.400
This is just a vector in Rm.,00:02:50.400,00:02:52.560
"Or it's really a vector in y,
which is a subset of Rm.",00:02:52.560,00:02:56.360
"And then you apply the
transformation T to that",00:02:56.360,00:02:58.600
vector to get you into z.,00:02:58.600,00:03:00.460
"Given this we can use our matrix
representations to",00:03:07.170,00:03:10.340
"replace this kind of
transformation representation.",00:03:10.340,00:03:13.620
"Although they're really
the same thing.",00:03:13.620,00:03:14.830
"What is a transformation
of S applied to x?",00:03:14.830,00:03:18.110
"Well this right here is just
A times x, where this",00:03:18.110,00:03:25.830
is an m by n matrix.,00:03:25.830,00:03:29.530
"So we can say that this is equal
to the transformation",00:03:29.530,00:03:31.800
applied to A times x.,00:03:31.800,00:03:35.480
"Now, what is the T
transformation applied",00:03:35.480,00:03:40.080
to any vector x?,00:03:40.080,00:03:41.410
"Well that's the matrix B
times your vector x.",00:03:41.410,00:03:44.740
"So this thing right here is
going to be equal to B times",00:03:44.740,00:03:49.960
whatever I put in there.,00:03:49.960,00:03:51.040
"So the matrix B times the matrix
A times the vector x",00:03:51.040,00:03:58.790
right there.,00:03:58.790,00:03:59.710
"This is what our composition
transformation is.",00:03:59.710,00:04:04.010
"The composition of T with S
applied to the vector x.",00:04:04.010,00:04:08.440
"Which takes us from the set x
all the way to the set z is",00:04:08.440,00:04:12.730
"this, if we use the matrix
forms of the two",00:04:12.730,00:04:16.140
transformations.,00:04:16.140,00:04:17.700
"Now at the end of last video I
said I wanted to find just",00:04:17.700,00:04:23.850
"some matrix that if I were to
multiply times this vector,",00:04:23.850,00:04:28.500
"that is equivalent to
this transformation.",00:04:28.500,00:04:30.260
"And I know that I can
find this matrix.",00:04:30.260,00:04:32.800
"I know that this exists because
this is a linear",00:04:32.800,00:04:36.100
transformation.,00:04:36.100,00:04:37.440
So how can we do that?,00:04:37.440,00:04:38.910
"Well, we just do what we've
always done in the past. We",00:04:38.910,00:04:42.180
"start with the identity matrix,
and we apply the",00:04:42.180,00:04:45.040
"transformation to every column
of the identity matrix.",00:04:45.040,00:04:48.370
"And then you end up with your
matrix representation of the",00:04:48.370,00:04:51.980
transformation itself.,00:04:51.980,00:04:53.530
"So first of all, how
big is the identity",00:04:53.530,00:04:55.200
matrix going to be?,00:04:55.200,00:04:56.750
"Well, these guys that we're
inputting into our",00:04:56.750,00:04:59.600
"transformation, they are subsets
of x, or they're",00:04:59.600,00:05:03.500
"members of x, which is
an n dimensional",00:05:03.500,00:05:05.960
"space, a subset of Rn.",00:05:05.960,00:05:07.410
"So all we do to figure out C
is we start off with the",00:05:13.920,00:05:18.460
identity matrix.,00:05:18.460,00:05:19.710
"The n dimensional identity
matrix, because",00:05:21.880,00:05:24.610
our domain is Rn.,00:05:24.610,00:05:27.110
"And of course we know what
that looks like.",00:05:27.110,00:05:28.705
"We have 1, 0 all the way down.",00:05:31.340,00:05:34.600
"It's going to be an n by n
matrix, and then 0, 1 all the",00:05:34.600,00:05:37.880
way down 0's.,00:05:37.880,00:05:39.540
"These 0's right here, and then
you have 1's go all the way",00:05:39.540,00:05:42.410
"down the columns and everything
else is 0.",00:05:42.410,00:05:46.430
"We've seen this multiple times
that's what your identity",00:05:46.430,00:05:48.680
"matrix looks like, just 1's down
the column from the top",00:05:48.680,00:05:51.970
left to the bottom right.,00:05:51.970,00:05:53.700
"Now to figure out C, the matrix
representation of our",00:05:53.700,00:05:59.340
"transformation, all we do is we
apply the transformation to",00:05:59.340,00:06:03.060
each of these columns.,00:06:03.060,00:06:04.950
"So we can write that our matrix
C is equal to the",00:06:04.950,00:06:12.580
"transformation applied
to this first column.",00:06:12.580,00:06:14.900
What is the transformation?,00:06:14.900,00:06:15.615
"It is the matrix B times the
matrix A times whatever you're",00:06:15.615,00:06:23.150
taking the transformation of.,00:06:23.150,00:06:24.450
"In this case we're taking the
transformation of that.",00:06:24.450,00:06:26.190
"We're taking the transformation
of 1, 0, 0 all",00:06:26.190,00:06:30.850
the way down.,00:06:30.850,00:06:31.380
"There's 1 followed by
a bunch of 0's.",00:06:31.380,00:06:34.100
"That's going to be our
first column of C.",00:06:34.100,00:06:36.350
"Our second column of C is going
to be B times A times",00:06:36.350,00:06:42.370
"the second column of our
identity matrix.",00:06:42.370,00:06:45.300
"And, of course, you remember
these are each the standard",00:06:45.300,00:06:47.650
basis vectors for Rn.,00:06:47.650,00:06:49.980
"So this is going to be times
E2, which is a 0, 1,",00:06:57.220,00:07:00.740
0 all the way down.,00:07:00.740,00:07:04.290
"And then we're going to keep
doing that until we do get to",00:07:04.290,00:07:06.560
"the last column, which is B
times A times a bunch of 0's",00:07:06.560,00:07:13.700
"all the way down
until get a 1.",00:07:13.700,00:07:15.680
"The nth term is just
a 1 right there.",00:07:15.680,00:07:18.970
"Now what is this going
to be equal to?",00:07:18.970,00:07:22.110
"It looks fairly complicated
right now.",00:07:22.110,00:07:24.540
"But all you have to do is make
the realization-- and we've",00:07:24.540,00:07:27.970
seen this multiple times.,00:07:27.970,00:07:29.500
"If we write our vector A or we
write our matrix A as just a",00:07:29.500,00:07:33.490
bunch of column vectors.,00:07:33.490,00:07:34.690
"So this is a column vector A1,
A2, all the way to An.",00:07:34.690,00:07:40.610
"We already learned that this
was and n buy m matrix.",00:07:43.150,00:07:45.413
"Then what is the vector A times,
for example, x1, x2 to",00:07:48.690,00:07:56.670
all the way down to xn.,00:07:56.670,00:07:59.140
"We've seen this multiple
times.",00:07:59.140,00:08:00.800
"This is the equivalent to x1
times A1 plus x2 times A2, all",00:08:00.800,00:08:12.390
the way to plus xn times An.,00:08:12.390,00:08:16.210
"We've seen this multiple
times.",00:08:16.210,00:08:17.460
"It's a linear combination of
these column vectors where the",00:08:17.460,00:08:20.290
"waiting factors are the terms
in our vector that we're",00:08:20.290,00:08:23.000
taking the product of.,00:08:23.000,00:08:24.470
"So given that, what is this
guy going to reduce to?",00:08:24.470,00:08:27.620
"This is going to be A1 times
this first entry right here,",00:08:27.620,00:08:31.410
"times x1, plus A2 times a second
entry, plus A3 times a",00:08:31.410,00:08:36.100
third entry.,00:08:36.100,00:08:36.559
"But all these other
entries are 0.",00:08:36.559,00:08:37.900
"The x2's all the way
to the xn are 0's.",00:08:37.900,00:08:40.189
"So you're only going to end
up with 1 times the first",00:08:40.189,00:08:43.789
column here in A.,00:08:43.789,00:08:45.590
"So this will reduce to--
let me write this.",00:08:45.590,00:08:48.680
"So the first column is going
to be B times-- now A times",00:08:48.680,00:08:56.820
"this E1 vector, I guess we could
call it, right there is",00:08:56.820,00:09:01.780
"just going to be 1 times the
first column in A plus 0 times",00:09:01.780,00:09:05.720
"the second column in A plus
0 times the third column.",00:09:05.720,00:09:08.430
"So it's just 1 times the
first column in A.",00:09:08.430,00:09:11.420
So it's just A1.,00:09:11.420,00:09:15.240
That simple.,00:09:15.240,00:09:16.300
"Now what is this one going
to be equal to?",00:09:16.300,00:09:18.610
"It's going to be 0 times the
first column in A, plus 1",00:09:18.610,00:09:23.740
"times a second column in A, plus
0 times a third column in",00:09:23.740,00:09:27.660
"A, and the rest are
going to be 0's.",00:09:27.660,00:09:28.180
"So it's just going to be 1 times
the second column in A.",00:09:28.180,00:09:31.250
"So the second column in our
transformation matrix is just",00:09:31.250,00:09:34.410
going to be B times A2.,00:09:34.410,00:09:37.850
"And I think you get
the idea here.",00:09:37.850,00:09:40.230
"The next one is going to be B
times A3 and all the way until",00:09:40.230,00:09:42.830
you get B times An.,00:09:42.830,00:09:46.660
"So that's how you would
solve for your",00:09:50.870,00:09:52.670
transformation matrix.,00:09:52.670,00:09:53.800
"Remember what we were
trying to do.",00:09:53.800,00:09:55.050
"We were trying to find some--
let me write down and",00:09:55.050,00:09:59.100
"summarize everything that
we've done so far.",00:09:59.100,00:10:02.140
"We had a mapping S, that was
a mapping from x to y.",00:10:02.140,00:10:09.170
But x was a subset of Rn.,00:10:09.170,00:10:13.490
Y was a subset of Rm.,00:10:13.490,00:10:17.370
"And so we said that this linear
transformation could be",00:10:17.370,00:10:21.110
"represented as some matrix A
where A is an m by n matrix",00:10:21.110,00:10:27.760
times a vector x.,00:10:27.760,00:10:29.750
"Then I showed you another
transformation, we already",00:10:29.750,00:10:33.700
"called it T, which was a
mapping from y to z.",00:10:33.700,00:10:39.320
z is a subset of Rl.,00:10:39.320,00:10:40.570
"And of course, the
transformation T applied to",00:10:44.030,00:10:47.490
"some vector in y, can be
represented as some matrix B",00:10:47.490,00:10:53.430
times that vector.,00:10:53.430,00:10:57.450
"I shouldn't have drawn
parentheses there,",00:10:57.450,00:10:58.740
but you get the idea.,00:10:58.740,00:10:59.430
"And this, since it's a mapping
from a subset of our Rm to Rl,",00:10:59.430,00:11:03.870
this will be an l by m matrix.,00:11:03.870,00:11:07.850
"And then we said, look, if
we actually just take the",00:11:07.850,00:11:12.220
"composition of T with S,
of some vector in x,",00:11:12.220,00:11:20.750
this reduced to B.,00:11:20.750,00:11:23.180
"So first we applied the
S transformation.",00:11:23.180,00:11:25.790
"We multiplied the matrix
A times x.",00:11:25.790,00:11:29.060
"And then we applied the T
transformation to this.",00:11:33.810,00:11:36.800
"So we just multiplied
B times that.",00:11:36.800,00:11:38.910
"Now we know this is a linear
transformation, which means it",00:11:42.200,00:11:45.100
"can be represented as a
matrix vector product.",00:11:45.100,00:11:47.450
"And we just figured out what the
matrix vector product is.",00:11:47.450,00:11:50.840
"So this thing is going to be
equal to C times x, which is",00:11:50.840,00:12:00.210
"equal to this thing right there,
which is equal to that",00:12:00.210,00:12:03.400
thing right there.,00:12:03.400,00:12:04.040
"Which is equal to-- let me write
it this way-- B, A1,",00:12:04.040,00:12:16.280
"where A1 is the first column
vector in our matrix A.",00:12:16.280,00:12:20.020
"And then the second column
here is going to be B.",00:12:20.020,00:12:23.030
"And then we have A2, where
this is the second column",00:12:23.030,00:12:26.990
vector in A.,00:12:26.990,00:12:27.970
"And you can keep going all the
way until you have B times An",00:12:27.970,00:12:42.140
"times x, of course.",00:12:42.140,00:12:43.770
Now this is fair enough.,00:12:51.670,00:12:52.980
"We can always do this if you
give me some matrix.",00:12:52.980,00:12:56.470
"Remember this is an
l by m matrix.",00:12:56.470,00:13:00.350
"And you give me another matrix
right here that is an m by n",00:13:00.350,00:13:05.370
"matrix, I can always do this.",00:13:05.370,00:13:08.650
"And how do I know I can
I always do that?",00:13:08.650,00:13:11.250
"Because each of these
A's are going to",00:13:11.250,00:13:16.000
"have m entries, right?",00:13:16.000,00:13:17.900
They're going to be Ai.,00:13:17.900,00:13:22.580
"All of them are going to
be members of our Rm.",00:13:22.580,00:13:25.150
So this is well-defined.,00:13:25.150,00:13:26.490
This has m columns.,00:13:26.490,00:13:28.080
This has m entries.,00:13:28.080,00:13:29.360
"So each of these matrix vector
products are well-defined.",00:13:29.360,00:13:32.820
"Now, this is an interesting
thing, because we were able to",00:13:32.820,00:13:36.480
"figure out the actual matrix
representation of this",00:13:36.480,00:13:39.620
composition transformation.,00:13:39.620,00:13:42.350
"Let's extend it a little
bit further.",00:13:42.350,00:13:43.970
"Wouldn't it be nice if this
were the same thing as the",00:13:43.970,00:13:47.630
matrices B times A.,00:13:47.630,00:13:49.820
All of that times x.,00:13:58.860,00:14:00.740
"Wouldn't it be nice if these
were the same thing?",00:14:04.050,00:14:06.500
"Because then we could say that
the composition of T with S of",00:14:06.500,00:14:10.010
"x is equal to the matrix
representation of B times a",00:14:10.010,00:14:14.490
matrix representation of S.,00:14:14.490,00:14:18.580
"And you take the product
of those two.",00:14:18.580,00:14:20.270
"And that will create a new
matrix representation which",00:14:20.270,00:14:22.690
you can call C.,00:14:22.690,00:14:24.135
"That you can then multiply
times x.",00:14:24.135,00:14:26.600
"So you won't have to do it
individually every time, or do",00:14:26.600,00:14:29.480
it this way.,00:14:29.480,00:14:30.360
"And I guess the truth of the
matter is there is nothing to",00:14:30.360,00:14:33.870
"stop us from defining this
to be equal to B times A.",00:14:33.870,00:14:38.330
"We have not defined what a
matrix times a matrix is yet.",00:14:38.330,00:14:42.080
So we might as well.,00:14:42.080,00:14:43.290
"This is a good enough motivation
for us to define it",00:14:43.290,00:14:45.500
in this way.,00:14:45.500,00:14:46.530
"So let's throw in
this definition.",00:14:46.530,00:14:48.010
So if we have some matrix B.,00:14:52.360,00:14:54.510
B is an l by m matrix.,00:14:59.010,00:15:04.980
"And then we have some other
matrix A-- and I'll actually",00:15:04.980,00:15:08.630
"show what A looks like, where
these are its column vectors.",00:15:08.630,00:15:11.090
"A1, A2, all the way to An.",00:15:11.090,00:15:16.600
"We're going to define
the product.",00:15:16.600,00:15:18.500
So this is a definition.,00:15:18.500,00:15:19.750
"We're going to define the
product BA as being equal to",00:15:22.730,00:15:28.880
"the matrix B times each of
the column vectors of A.",00:15:28.880,00:15:33.360
So it's B times A1.,00:15:33.360,00:15:36.080
"That's going to be
its first column.",00:15:36.080,00:15:37.410
"This is going to
be B times A2.",00:15:37.410,00:15:40.220
All the way to B times An.,00:15:40.220,00:15:44.320
"And you've seen this before in
algebra two, but the reason",00:15:44.320,00:15:46.750
"why I went through almost two
videos to get to here, is to",00:15:46.750,00:15:50.740
"show you the motivation for
why matrix products are",00:15:50.740,00:15:56.480
defined this way.,00:15:56.480,00:15:57.670
"Because it makes the notion
of compositions of",00:15:57.670,00:16:00.270
"transformations kind
of natural.",00:16:00.270,00:16:01.900
"If you take the composition of
one linear transformation with",00:16:01.900,00:16:05.740
"another, the resulting
transformation matrix is just",00:16:05.740,00:16:10.050
"the product, as we've just
defined it, of their two",00:16:10.050,00:16:14.000
transformation matrices.,00:16:14.000,00:16:16.250
"For those of you who might not
have a lot of experience",00:16:16.250,00:16:19.850
"taking products of matrices, and
who think this is fairly",00:16:19.850,00:16:22.590
"abstract to look at, in the next
video I'll actually do a",00:16:22.590,00:16:25.240
"bunch of examples and show you
that this definition is",00:16:25.240,00:16:27.270
actually fairly straightforward.,00:16:27.270,00:16:29.560
