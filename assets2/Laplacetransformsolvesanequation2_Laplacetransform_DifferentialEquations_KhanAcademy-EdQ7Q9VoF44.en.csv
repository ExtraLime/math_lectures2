Welcome back.,00:00:00.790,00:00:01.530
"We're finally using the Laplace
Transform to do",00:00:01.530,00:00:04.140
something useful.,00:00:04.140,00:00:05.460
"In the first part of this
problem, we just had this",00:00:05.460,00:00:07.880
"fairly straightforward
differential equation.",00:00:07.880,00:00:09.850
"And I know it's a little bit
frustrating right now, because",00:00:09.850,00:00:11.730
"you're like, this is such an
easy one to solve using the",00:00:11.730,00:00:13.650
characteristic equation.,00:00:13.650,00:00:15.260
"Why are we doing Laplace
Transforms?",00:00:15.260,00:00:16.640
"Well I just want to show you
that they can solve even these",00:00:16.640,00:00:18.410
"problems. But later on there
are going to be classes of",00:00:18.410,00:00:20.660
"problems that, frankly, our
traditional methods aren't as",00:00:20.660,00:00:24.650
good as the Laplace Transform.,00:00:24.650,00:00:26.500
"But anyway, how did
we solve this?",00:00:26.500,00:00:27.790
"We just took the Laplace
Transform of both sides of",00:00:27.790,00:00:29.850
this equation.,00:00:29.850,00:00:30.870
We got all of this hairy mess.,00:00:30.870,00:00:33.540
"We used the property of the
derivative of functions, where",00:00:33.540,00:00:36.145
"you take the Laplace Transform,
and we ended up,",00:00:36.145,00:00:38.030
"after doing a lot of algebra
essentially, we got this.",00:00:38.030,00:00:40.100
"We got the Laplace Transform of
y is equal to this thing.",00:00:40.100,00:00:43.110
"We just took the Laplace
Transform of both sides and",00:00:43.110,00:00:45.330
manipulated algebraically.,00:00:45.330,00:00:47.170
"So now our task in this video
is to figure out what y's",00:00:47.170,00:00:50.540
"Laplace Transform
is this thing?",00:00:50.540,00:00:52.786
"And essentially what we're
trying to do, is we're trying",00:00:52.786,00:00:55.070
"to take the inverse Laplace
Transform of both sides of",00:00:55.070,00:00:58.250
this equation.,00:00:58.250,00:00:58.810
"So another way to say it, we
could say that y-- if we take",00:00:58.810,00:01:03.010
"the inverse Laplace Transform
of both sides-- we could say",00:01:03.010,00:01:05.247
"that y is equal to the
inverse Laplace",00:01:05.247,00:01:09.190
Transform of this thing.,00:01:09.190,00:01:12.260
"2s plus 13, over s squared
plus 5s plus 6.",00:01:12.260,00:01:19.372
"Now we'll eventually actually
learn the formal definition of",00:01:19.372,00:01:21.780
the inverse Laplace Transform.,00:01:21.780,00:01:23.600
"How do you go from the s
domain to the t domain?",00:01:23.600,00:01:27.040
"Or how do you go from
the frequency",00:01:27.040,00:01:28.210
domain to the time domain?,00:01:28.210,00:01:29.880
"We're not going to worry
about that right now.",00:01:29.880,00:01:32.010
"What we're going to do is we're
going to get this into a",00:01:32.010,00:01:34.330
"form that we recognize,
and say, oh,",00:01:34.330,00:01:36.750
I know those functions.,00:01:36.750,00:01:38.180
"That's the Laplace Transform
of whatever and whatever.",00:01:38.180,00:01:40.200
And then we'll know what y is.,00:01:40.200,00:01:42.270
So let's try to do that.,00:01:42.270,00:01:44.230
"So what we're going to use is
something that you probably",00:01:44.230,00:01:47.750
"haven't used since Algebra two,
which is I think when",00:01:47.750,00:01:50.970
"it's taught in, you know,
eighth, ninth,",00:01:50.970,00:01:52.720
"or 10th grade, depending.",00:01:52.720,00:01:53.680
"And you finally see it now in
differential equations that it",00:01:53.680,00:01:55.740
actually has some use.,00:01:55.740,00:01:57.640
Let me write it.,00:01:57.640,00:01:58.450
"We're going to use partial
fraction expansion.",00:01:58.450,00:02:01.780
"And I'll do a little primer
on that, in case you don't",00:02:01.780,00:02:04.080
remember it.,00:02:04.080,00:02:04.740
"So anyway, let's just factor
the bottom part right here.",00:02:04.740,00:02:08.539
"And you'll see where I'm
going with this.",00:02:08.539,00:02:11.510
"So if I factor the bottom, I get
s plus 2 times s plus 3.",00:02:11.510,00:02:19.130
"And what we want to do, is we
want to rewrite this fraction",00:02:19.130,00:02:25.420
"as the sum of 2-- I
guess you could",00:02:25.420,00:02:28.980
call it partial fractions.,00:02:28.980,00:02:30.570
"I think that's why it's called
partial fraction expansion.",00:02:30.570,00:02:33.230
"So we want to write this as a
sum of A over s plus 2, plus B",00:02:33.230,00:02:41.110
over s plus 3.,00:02:41.110,00:02:43.250
"And if we can do this, then--
and bells might already be",00:02:43.250,00:02:48.280
"ringing in your head-- we know
that these things that look",00:02:48.280,00:02:54.710
"like this are the Laplace
Transform of functions that",00:02:54.710,00:02:56.650
we've already solved for.,00:02:56.650,00:02:57.960
"And I'll do a little review
on that in a second.",00:02:57.960,00:03:01.110
"But anyway, how do we
figure out A and B?",00:03:01.110,00:03:03.680
"Well if we were to actually add
A and B, if we were to--",00:03:03.680,00:03:06.800
"let's do a little aside right
here-- so if we said that A--",00:03:06.800,00:03:12.850
"so if we were to give them a
common denominator, which is",00:03:12.850,00:03:16.480
"this, s plus 2 times s plus 3.",00:03:16.480,00:03:21.295
Then what would A become?,00:03:21.295,00:03:22.750
"We'd have to multiply A
times s plus 3, right?",00:03:22.750,00:03:25.350
So we'd get As plus 3A.,00:03:25.350,00:03:29.030
"This, as I've written it right
now, is the same thing as A",00:03:31.640,00:03:34.220
over s plus 2.,00:03:34.220,00:03:34.980
"You could cancel out an s plus
3 in the top and the bottom.",00:03:34.980,00:03:39.080
"And now we're going to
add the B to it.",00:03:39.080,00:03:41.080
"So plus-- I'll do that in a
different color-- plus-- well,",00:03:41.080,00:03:45.500
"if we have this as the
denominator, we could multiply",00:03:45.500,00:03:48.110
"the numerator and
the denominator",00:03:48.110,00:03:49.140
"by s plus 2, right?",00:03:49.140,00:03:51.100
"To get B times s, plus
2B, and that's going",00:03:51.100,00:03:58.890
to equal this thing.,00:03:58.890,00:04:01.470
"And all I did is I added
these two fractions.",00:04:01.470,00:04:03.360
Nothing fancier than there.,00:04:03.360,00:04:04.350
That was Algebra two.,00:04:04.350,00:04:05.920
"Actually, I think I should
do an actual",00:04:05.920,00:04:07.230
video on that as well.,00:04:07.230,00:04:08.335
"But that's going to
equal this thing.",00:04:08.335,00:04:11.410
"2s plus 13, all of that over
s plus 2 times s plus 3.",00:04:11.410,00:04:20.899
"Notice in all differential
equations, the hairiest part's",00:04:20.899,00:04:23.250
always the algebra.,00:04:23.250,00:04:24.690
"So now what we do
is we match up.",00:04:24.690,00:04:26.780
"We say, well, let's add
the s terms here.",00:04:26.780,00:04:29.110
"And we could say that the
numerators have to equal each",00:04:29.110,00:04:31.440
"other, because the denominators
are equal.",00:04:31.440,00:04:33.350
"So we have A plus Bs plus 3A
plus 2B is equal to 2s plus B.",00:04:33.350,00:04:51.960
"So the coefficient on s, on
the right-hand side, is 2.",00:04:51.960,00:04:55.110
"The coefficient on the left-hand
side is A plus B, so",00:04:55.110,00:04:57.910
"we know that A plus
B is equal to 2.",00:04:57.910,00:04:59.980
"And then on the right-hand side,
we see 3A plus 2B must",00:05:02.950,00:05:08.270
"be equal to-- oh,
this is a 13.",00:05:08.270,00:05:11.150
Did I say B?,00:05:11.150,00:05:11.930
This is a 13.,00:05:11.930,00:05:14.190
That's a 13.,00:05:14.190,00:05:15.530
"It looks just like a B, right?",00:05:15.530,00:05:16.890
That was 2s plus 13.,00:05:16.890,00:05:19.100
"Anyway, so on the right-hand
side I get, it was 3A plus 2B",00:05:19.100,00:05:28.640
is equal to 13.,00:05:28.640,00:05:32.150
"Now we have two equations
with two unknowns,",00:05:32.150,00:05:34.790
and what do we get?,00:05:34.790,00:05:35.610
"I know this is very tiresome,
but it'll be",00:05:35.610,00:05:37.250
satisfying in the end.,00:05:37.250,00:05:38.260
"Because you'll actually
solve something",00:05:38.260,00:05:39.460
with the Laplace Transform.,00:05:39.460,00:05:40.515
"So let's multiply the top
equation by 2, or let's just",00:05:40.515,00:05:43.660
say minus 2.,00:05:43.660,00:05:44.350
"So we get minus 2A minus
2B equals minus 4.",00:05:44.350,00:05:50.320
"And then we get-- add the two
equations-- you get A is equal",00:05:50.320,00:05:54.240
"to-- these cancel out--
A is equal to 9.",00:05:54.240,00:05:57.170
Great.,00:05:57.170,00:05:58.000
"If A is equal to 9, what
is B equal to?",00:05:58.000,00:06:00.530
"B is equal to 9 plus
what is equal to 2?",00:06:00.530,00:06:05.520
Or 2 minus 9 is minus 7.,00:06:05.520,00:06:09.130
"And we have done some serious
simplification.",00:06:09.130,00:06:12.160
"Because now we can rewrite this
whole expression as the",00:06:12.160,00:06:15.770
"Laplace Transform of y is equal
to A over s plus 2, is",00:06:15.770,00:06:23.390
"equal to 9 over s plus 2,
minus 7 over s plus 3.",00:06:23.390,00:06:34.060
"Or another way of writing it, we
could write it as equal to",00:06:34.060,00:06:38.810
"9 times 1 over s plus 2, minus
7 times 1 over s plus 3.",00:06:38.810,00:06:47.620
"Why did I take the trouble
to do this?",00:06:47.620,00:06:49.630
"Well hopefully, you'll recognize
this was actually",00:06:49.630,00:06:51.920
"the second Laplace Transform
we figured out.",00:06:51.920,00:06:55.010
What was that?,00:06:58.200,00:06:59.290
"I'll write it down here just
so you remember it.",00:06:59.290,00:07:01.950
"It was the Laplace Transform of
e to the at, was equal to 1",00:07:01.950,00:07:11.970
over s minus a.,00:07:11.970,00:07:15.000
"That was the second Laplace
Transform we figured out.",00:07:15.000,00:07:18.070
So this is interesting.,00:07:18.070,00:07:21.200
"This is the Laplace
Transform of what?",00:07:21.200,00:07:22.880
"So if we were to take the
inverse Laplace Transform--",00:07:22.880,00:07:24.730
"actually let me just
stay consistent.",00:07:24.730,00:07:26.900
"So that means that this is the
Laplace Transform of y, is",00:07:26.900,00:07:32.820
"equal to 9 times the Laplace
Transform of what?",00:07:32.820,00:07:36.360
"If we just do pattern matching,
if this is s minus",00:07:36.360,00:07:38.850
"a, then a is minus 2.",00:07:38.850,00:07:41.080
"So 9 times the Laplace
Transform of e",00:07:41.080,00:07:45.220
to the minus 2t.,00:07:45.220,00:07:48.970
Does that make sense?,00:07:48.970,00:07:50.380
"Take this, put it in this one,
which we figured out, and you",00:07:50.380,00:07:52.900
get 1 over s plus 2.,00:07:52.900,00:07:54.190
"And let me clean this up a
little bit, because I'm going",00:07:54.190,00:07:56.205
to need that real estate.,00:07:56.205,00:07:57.455
I'll write this.,00:08:02.450,00:08:03.120
"I'll leave that there, because
we'll still use that.",00:08:03.120,00:08:06.270
"And then we have minus 7 times--
this is the Laplace",00:08:06.270,00:08:10.800
Transform of what?,00:08:10.800,00:08:11.500
"This is the Laplace Transform
of e to the minus 3t.",00:08:11.500,00:08:16.190
"This pattern matching, you're
like, wow, if you saw this,",00:08:20.450,00:08:25.190
"you would go to your Laplace
Transform table, if you didn't",00:08:25.190,00:08:27.270
"remember it, you'd see this.",00:08:27.270,00:08:28.640
"You're like, wow, that looks
a lot like that.",00:08:28.640,00:08:31.430
"I just have to figure
out what a is.",00:08:31.430,00:08:33.000
I have s plus 3.,00:08:33.000,00:08:33.960
I have s minus a.,00:08:33.960,00:08:35.320
"So in this case, a is
equal to minus 3.",00:08:35.320,00:08:37.520
"So if a is equal to minus 3,
this is the Laplace Transform",00:08:37.520,00:08:39.894
of e to the minus 3t.,00:08:39.894,00:08:42.760
"So now we can take the inverse
Laplace-- actually,",00:08:42.760,00:08:46.390
before we do that.,00:08:46.390,00:08:47.070
"We know that because the Laplace
Transform is a linear",00:08:47.070,00:08:49.750
"operator-- and actually now I
can delete this down here-- we",00:08:49.750,00:08:54.760
"know that the Laplace Transform
is a linear",00:08:54.760,00:08:57.140
"operator, so we can
write this.",00:08:57.140,00:09:00.110
"And you normally wouldn't go
through all of these steps.",00:09:00.110,00:09:01.710
"I just really want to make you
understand what we're doing.",00:09:01.710,00:09:05.530
"So we could say that this is the
same thing as the Laplace",00:09:05.530,00:09:08.140
"Transform of 9e to the minus 2t,
minus 7e to the minus 3t.",00:09:08.140,00:09:16.700
"Now we have something
interesting.",00:09:19.570,00:09:20.860
"The Laplace Transform of y
is equal to the Laplace",00:09:20.860,00:09:23.400
Transform of this.,00:09:23.400,00:09:24.830
"Well if that's the case, then
y must be equal to 9e to the",00:09:24.830,00:09:30.570
"minus 2t, minus 7e
to the minus 3t.",00:09:30.570,00:09:35.320
"And I never proved to you, but
the Laplace Transform is",00:09:35.320,00:09:38.080
actually a 1:1 Transformation.,00:09:38.080,00:09:40.300
"That if a function's Laplace
Transform, if I take a",00:09:40.300,00:09:43.330
"function against the Laplace
Transform, and then if I were",00:09:43.330,00:09:45.420
"take the inverse Laplace
Transform, the only function",00:09:45.420,00:09:48.810
"whose Laplace Transform
that that is, is",00:09:48.810,00:09:50.820
that original function.,00:09:50.820,00:09:51.710
"It's not like two different
functions can have the same",00:09:51.710,00:09:54.550
Laplace Transform.,00:09:54.550,00:09:56.050
"Anyway, a couple of things
to think about here.",00:09:56.050,00:09:58.680
"Notice, we had that thing that
kind of looked like a",00:09:58.680,00:10:02.070
"characteristic equation
pop up here and there.",00:10:02.070,00:10:04.980
"And we still have to solve a
system of two equations with",00:10:04.980,00:10:08.340
two unknowns.,00:10:08.340,00:10:08.850
"Those are both things that we
had to do when we solve an",00:10:08.850,00:10:13.750
"initial value problem, when we
use just traditional, the",00:10:13.750,00:10:17.030
characteristic equation.,00:10:17.030,00:10:18.340
"But here it happened
all at once.",00:10:18.340,00:10:20.150
"And frankly it was a little bit
hairier because we had to",00:10:20.150,00:10:21.900
"do all this partial fraction
expansion.",00:10:21.900,00:10:24.040
But it's pretty neat.,00:10:24.040,00:10:25.050
"The Laplace Transform got
us something useful.",00:10:25.050,00:10:28.210
"In the next video I'll actually
do a non-homogeneous",00:10:28.210,00:10:30.970
"equation, and show you that the
Laplace Transform applies",00:10:30.970,00:10:33.850
equally well there.,00:10:33.850,00:10:34.830
"So it's kind of a more
consistent theory of solving",00:10:34.830,00:10:37.680
"differential equations, instead
of kind of guessing",00:10:37.680,00:10:39.730
"solutions, and solving for
coefficients and all of that.",00:10:39.730,00:10:43.140
See you in the next video.,00:10:43.140,00:10:45.100
