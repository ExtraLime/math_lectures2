"So I have two
2-dimensional vectors",00:00:00.750,00:00:02.970
"right over here,
vector a and vector b.",00:00:02.970,00:00:05.970
"And what I want to think
about is how can we define",00:00:05.970,00:00:08.575
"or what would be
a reasonable way",00:00:08.575,00:00:09.950
"to define the sum of
vector a plus vector b?",00:00:09.950,00:00:15.137
"Well, one thing that
might jump at your mind",00:00:15.137,00:00:16.970
"is, look, well, each of
these are two dimensional.",00:00:16.970,00:00:19.160
They both have two components.,00:00:19.160,00:00:20.410
"Why don't we just add the
corresponding components?",00:00:20.410,00:00:23.220
"So for the sum, why don't
we make the first component",00:00:23.220,00:00:27.610
"of the sum just a sum of
the first two components",00:00:27.610,00:00:30.130
of these two vectors.,00:00:30.130,00:00:31.110
"So why don't we just make
it 6 plus negative 4?",00:00:31.110,00:00:35.090
"Well, 6 plus negative
4 is equal to 2.",00:00:35.090,00:00:38.660
"And why don't we just
make the second component",00:00:38.660,00:00:41.010
"the sum of the two
second components?",00:00:41.010,00:00:43.350
"So negative 2 plus 4
is also equal to 2.",00:00:43.350,00:00:48.360
"So we start with two
2-dimensional vectors.",00:00:48.360,00:00:50.540
"You add them together,
you get another two",00:00:50.540,00:00:52.560
2-dimensional vectors.,00:00:52.560,00:00:53.600
"If you think about it in terms
of real coordinates bases,",00:00:53.600,00:00:56.630
"both of these are
members of R2--",00:00:56.630,00:00:59.040
"I'll write this down here just
so we get used to the notation.",00:00:59.040,00:01:02.040
"So vector a and vector b
are both members of R2,",00:01:02.040,00:01:14.032
"which is just
another way of saying",00:01:14.032,00:01:15.490
that these are both two tuples.,00:01:15.490,00:01:16.980
"They are both two-dimensional
vectors right over here.",00:01:16.980,00:01:21.100
"Now, this might make sense just
looking at how we represented",00:01:21.100,00:01:23.720
"it, but how does
this actually make",00:01:23.720,00:01:25.340
visual or conceptual sense?,00:01:25.340,00:01:27.150
"And to do that, let's
actually plot these vectors.",00:01:27.150,00:01:29.310
"Let's try to represent
these vectors in some way.",00:01:29.310,00:01:32.100
Let's try to visualize them.,00:01:32.100,00:01:33.880
"So vector a, we could
visualize, this tells us",00:01:33.880,00:01:37.550
"how far this vector
moves in each",00:01:37.550,00:01:39.640
"of these directions--
horizontal direction",00:01:39.640,00:01:42.070
and vertical direction.,00:01:42.070,00:01:44.020
"So if we put the,
I guess you could",00:01:44.020,00:01:45.860
"say the tail of the vector
at the origin-- remember,",00:01:45.860,00:01:48.050
"we don't have to put
the tail at the origin,",00:01:48.050,00:01:49.720
"but that might make it a little
bit easier for us to draw it.",00:01:49.720,00:01:52.261
"We'll go 6 in the
horizontal direction.",00:01:52.261,00:01:53.940
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.",00:01:53.940,00:01:56.620
"And then negative
2 in the vertical.",00:01:56.620,00:01:58.420
So negative 2.,00:01:58.420,00:01:59.980
"So vector a could
look like this.",00:01:59.980,00:02:05.050
Vector a looks like that.,00:02:05.050,00:02:09.139
"And once again,
the important thing",00:02:09.139,00:02:11.050
"is the magnitude
and the direction.",00:02:11.050,00:02:12.750
"The magnitude is represented
by the length of this vector.",00:02:12.750,00:02:15.970
"And the direction
is the direction",00:02:15.970,00:02:17.740
that it is pointed in.,00:02:17.740,00:02:19.030
"And also just to emphasize,
I could have drawn vector a",00:02:19.030,00:02:21.810
"like that or I could
have put it over here.",00:02:21.810,00:02:26.280
"These are all
equivalent vectors.",00:02:26.280,00:02:30.210
These are all equal to vector a.,00:02:30.210,00:02:32.850
"All I really care about is the
magnitude and the direction.",00:02:32.850,00:02:37.450
"So with that in mind,
let's also draw vector b.",00:02:37.450,00:02:40.100
"Vector b in the horizontal
direction goes negative 4-- 1,",00:02:40.100,00:02:44.750
"2, 3, 4, and in the vertical
direction goes 4-- 1, 2, 3, 4.",00:02:44.750,00:02:50.170
"So its tail if we
start at the origin,",00:02:50.170,00:02:52.560
"if its tail is at
the origin, its head",00:02:52.560,00:02:55.050
"would be at negative 4, 4.",00:02:55.050,00:02:59.105
"So let me draw that
just like that.",00:02:59.105,00:03:03.110
"So that right over
here is vector b.",00:03:03.110,00:03:07.260
"And once again, vector b
we could draw it like that",00:03:07.260,00:03:10.150
"or we could draw it-- let me
copy and let me paste it--",00:03:10.150,00:03:15.240
"so this would also be
another way to draw vector b.",00:03:15.240,00:03:17.710
"Once again, what I
really care about",00:03:21.620,00:03:23.350
"is its magnitude
and its direction.",00:03:23.350,00:03:25.540
"All of these green vectors
have the same magnitude.",00:03:25.540,00:03:27.900
"They all have the same
length and they all",00:03:27.900,00:03:29.650
have the same direction.,00:03:29.650,00:03:31.520
"So how does the way that
I drew vector a and b",00:03:31.520,00:03:33.660
gel with what its sum is?,00:03:33.660,00:03:36.440
"So let me draw
its sum like this.",00:03:36.440,00:03:38.730
"Let me draw its sum
in this blue color.",00:03:38.730,00:03:41.920
"So the sum based on this
definition we just used,",00:03:41.920,00:03:44.610
"the vector addition
would be 2, 2.",00:03:44.610,00:03:47.060
"So 2, 2.",00:03:47.060,00:03:48.100
"So it would look
something like this.",00:03:48.100,00:03:53.600
"So how does this make
sense that the sum,",00:03:53.600,00:03:55.650
"that this purple vector
plus this green vector",00:03:55.650,00:04:00.250
"is somehow going to be
equal to this blue vector?",00:04:00.250,00:04:02.464
"I encourage you
to pause the video",00:04:02.464,00:04:03.880
"and think about if
that even makes sense.",00:04:03.880,00:04:07.300
"Well, one way to think about
it is this first purple vector,",00:04:07.300,00:04:10.600
it shifts us this much.,00:04:10.600,00:04:12.290
"It takes us from this
point to that point.",00:04:12.290,00:04:14.621
"And so if we were to add it,
let's start at this point",00:04:14.621,00:04:16.870
"and put the green
vector's tail right there",00:04:16.870,00:04:18.990
"and see where it
ends up putting us.",00:04:18.990,00:04:22.270
"So the green vector, we
already have a version.",00:04:22.270,00:04:25.320
"So once again, we
start the origin.",00:04:25.320,00:04:28.450
Vector a takes us there.,00:04:28.450,00:04:30.240
"Now, let's start over
there with the green vector",00:04:30.240,00:04:32.480
"and see where green
vector takes us.",00:04:32.480,00:04:34.460
And this makes sense.,00:04:34.460,00:04:35.720
Vector a plus vector b.,00:04:35.720,00:04:38.440
"Put the tail of vector b
at the head of vector a.",00:04:38.440,00:04:41.210
"So if you were to
start at the origin,",00:04:41.210,00:04:43.260
"vector a takes you
there then if you",00:04:43.260,00:04:45.190
"add on what vector b takes you,
it takes you right over there.",00:04:45.190,00:04:48.520
"So relative to the
origin, how much did you--",00:04:48.520,00:04:52.210
I guess you could say-- shift?,00:04:52.210,00:04:53.830
"And once again,
vectors don't only",00:04:53.830,00:04:55.420
"apply to things
like displacement.",00:04:55.420,00:04:56.435
It can apply to velocity.,00:04:56.435,00:04:57.345
"It can apply to
actual acceleration.",00:04:57.345,00:04:58.920
"It can apply to a
whole series of things,",00:04:58.920,00:05:01.350
"but when you
visualize it this way,",00:05:01.350,00:05:03.500
"you see that it does
make complete sense.",00:05:03.500,00:05:05.890
"This blue vector,
the sum of the two,",00:05:05.890,00:05:08.360
"is what results where
you start with vector a.",00:05:08.360,00:05:11.745
"At that point right over there,
vector a takes you there,",00:05:11.745,00:05:15.130
"then you take vector b's
tail, start over there",00:05:15.130,00:05:17.960
"and it takes you to
the tip of the sum.",00:05:17.960,00:05:21.140
"Now, one question you
might be having is well,",00:05:21.140,00:05:23.570
"vector a plus vector
b is this, but what",00:05:23.570,00:05:25.900
is vector b plus vector a?,00:05:25.900,00:05:31.510
Does this still work?,00:05:31.510,00:05:33.540
"Well, based on the
definition we had",00:05:33.540,00:05:35.200
"where you add the
corresponding components,",00:05:35.200,00:05:37.010
"you're still going to
get the same sum vector.",00:05:37.010,00:05:39.509
So it should come out the same.,00:05:39.509,00:05:40.800
"So this will just be
negative 4 plus 6 is 2.",00:05:40.800,00:05:43.720
4 plus negative 2 is 2.,00:05:43.720,00:05:46.430
But does that make visual sense?,00:05:46.430,00:05:48.420
So if we start with vector b.,00:05:48.420,00:05:49.836
"So let's say you
start right over here.",00:05:49.836,00:05:51.460
"Vector b takes you
right over there.",00:05:51.460,00:05:54.480
"And then if you were
to go there and you",00:05:54.480,00:05:56.943
"were to start with vector
a-- so let's do that.",00:05:56.943,00:05:59.960
"So actually, let me make this
a little bit-- actually, let me",00:05:59.960,00:06:02.760
start with a new vector b.,00:06:02.760,00:06:06.240
"So let's say that that's our
vector b right over there.",00:06:06.240,00:06:11.230
"And then-- actually,
let me give this",00:06:11.230,00:06:13.066
"a place where I'll have
some space to work with.",00:06:13.066,00:06:15.230
"So let's say that's my
vector b right over there.",00:06:15.230,00:06:18.450
"And then let me get a
copy of the vector a.",00:06:18.450,00:06:22.320
That's a good one.,00:06:22.320,00:06:23.832
So copy and let me paste it.,00:06:23.832,00:06:26.630
"So I could put vector a's
tail at the tip of vector b,",00:06:26.630,00:06:31.170
"and then it'll take
me right over there.",00:06:31.170,00:06:35.590
"So if I start right over
here, vector b takes me there.",00:06:35.590,00:06:42.680
"And now I'm adding to that
vector a, which starting here",00:06:42.680,00:06:45.750
will take me there.,00:06:45.750,00:06:47.080
"And so from my original starting
position, I have gone this far.",00:06:47.080,00:06:52.520
"Now, what is this vector?",00:06:52.520,00:06:53.860
"Well, this is exactly
the vector 2, 2.",00:06:53.860,00:06:57.360
"Or another way of
thinking about it,",00:06:57.360,00:06:58.860
"this vector shifts you 2 in
the horizontal direction and 2",00:06:58.860,00:07:02.630
in the vertical direction.,00:07:02.630,00:07:04.410
"So either way, you're going
to get the same result,",00:07:04.410,00:07:06.920
"and that should, hopefully,
make visual or conceptual sense",00:07:06.920,00:07:09.770
as well.,00:07:09.770,00:07:11.460
