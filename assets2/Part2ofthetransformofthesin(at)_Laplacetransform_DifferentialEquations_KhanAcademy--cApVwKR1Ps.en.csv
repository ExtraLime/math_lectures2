Welcome back.,00:00:00.660,00:00:01.510
"We were in the midst of figuring
out the Laplace",00:00:01.510,00:00:04.280
"transform of sine of at when
I was running out of time.",00:00:04.280,00:00:09.210
"This was the definition
of the Laplace",00:00:09.210,00:00:11.980
transform of sine of at.,00:00:11.980,00:00:13.470
I said that also equals y.,00:00:13.470,00:00:15.380
"This is going to be useful for
us, since we're going to be",00:00:15.380,00:00:17.750
"doing integration
by parts twice.",00:00:17.750,00:00:20.120
"So I did integration by parts
once, then I did integration",00:00:20.120,00:00:23.130
by parts twice.,00:00:23.130,00:00:24.160
"I said, you know, don't worry
about the boundaries of the",00:00:24.160,00:00:25.900
integral right now.,00:00:25.900,00:00:26.700
"Let's just worry about the
indefinite integral.",00:00:26.700,00:00:28.390
"And then after we solve for y--
let's just say y is the",00:00:28.390,00:00:31.820
"indefinite version of this--
then we can evaluate the",00:00:31.820,00:00:34.270
boundaries.,00:00:34.270,00:00:35.830
"And we got to this point, and we
made the realization, after",00:00:35.830,00:00:38.540
"doing two integration by parts
and being very careful not to",00:00:38.540,00:00:41.480
"hopefully make any careless
mistakes, we realized, wow,",00:00:41.480,00:00:44.560
this is our original y.,00:00:44.560,00:00:47.240
"If I put the boundaries here,
that's the same thing as the",00:00:47.240,00:00:49.410
"Laplace transform of
sine of at, right?",00:00:49.410,00:00:51.100
That's our original y.,00:00:51.100,00:00:52.760
"So now-- and I'll switch colors
just avoid monotony--",00:00:52.760,00:00:56.700
"this is equal to, actually,
let me just-- this is y.",00:00:56.700,00:01:00.295
Right?,00:01:05.209,00:01:05.560
"That was our original
definition.",00:01:05.560,00:01:07.600
"So let's add a squared over
sine squared y to",00:01:07.600,00:01:12.420
both sides of this.,00:01:12.420,00:01:13.900
"So this is equal to y plus--
I'm just adding this whole",00:01:13.900,00:01:19.400
"term to both sides of this
equation-- plus a squared over",00:01:19.400,00:01:24.130
"s squared y is equal to-- so
this term is now gone, so it's",00:01:24.130,00:01:31.470
equal to this stuff.,00:01:31.470,00:01:32.475
"And let's see if we
can simplify this.",00:01:32.475,00:01:34.260
"So let's factor out an e to the
minus st. Actually, let's",00:01:34.260,00:01:38.845
"factor out a negative e to the
minus st. So it's minus e to",00:01:38.845,00:01:45.360
"the minus st, times sine of--
well, let me just write 1 over",00:01:45.360,00:01:58.320
"s, sine of at, minus 1 over
s squared, cosine of at.",00:01:58.320,00:02:10.900
"I really hope I haven't made
any careless mistakes.",00:02:10.900,00:02:13.650
"And so this, we can add
the coefficient.",00:02:13.650,00:02:16.010
"So we get 1 plus a squared,
over s squared, times y.",00:02:16.010,00:02:22.030
"But that's the same thing as s
squared over s squared, plus a",00:02:22.030,00:02:25.440
squared over s squared.,00:02:25.440,00:02:27.100
"So it's s squared plus a
squared, over s squared, y is",00:02:27.100,00:02:31.920
"equal to minus e to the minus
st, times this whole thing,",00:02:31.920,00:02:40.320
"sine of at, minus 1 over s
squared, cosine of at.",00:02:40.320,00:02:47.510
"And now, this right here, since
we're doing everything",00:02:47.510,00:02:50.410
"with respect to dt, this is
just a constant, right?",00:02:50.410,00:02:53.050
"So we can say a constant
times the",00:02:53.050,00:02:54.740
antiderivative is equal to this.,00:02:54.740,00:02:56.290
"This is as good a time as any
to evaluate the boundaries.",00:02:56.290,00:03:00.360
Right?,00:03:00.360,00:03:00.580
"If this had a t here, I would
have to somehow get them back",00:03:00.580,00:03:03.440
on the other side.,00:03:03.440,00:03:04.820
"Because the t's are involved in
evaluating the boundaries,",00:03:04.820,00:03:07.230
"since we're doing our definite
integral or improper integral.",00:03:07.230,00:03:10.040
"So let's evaluate the
boundaries now.",00:03:10.040,00:03:13.230
"And we could've kept
them along with us",00:03:13.230,00:03:14.620
"the whole time, right?",00:03:14.620,00:03:15.810
"And just factored out this
term right here.",00:03:15.810,00:03:19.510
But anyway.,00:03:19.510,00:03:19.920
"So let's evaluate this
from 0 to infinity.",00:03:19.920,00:03:23.090
"And this should simplify
things.",00:03:23.090,00:03:25.050
"So the right-hand side of this
equation, when I evaluate it",00:03:25.050,00:03:28.820
"at infinity, what is e to
the minus infinity?",00:03:28.820,00:03:33.290
"Well, that is 0.",00:03:33.290,00:03:36.250
"We've established that
multiple times.",00:03:36.250,00:03:37.850
"And now it approaches 0 from
the negative side, but it's",00:03:37.850,00:03:40.350
"still going to be 0,
or it approaches 0.",00:03:40.350,00:03:44.020
What's sine of infinity?,00:03:44.020,00:03:45.010
"Well, sine just keeps
oscillating, between negative",00:03:45.010,00:03:48.130
"1 and plus 1, and
so does cosine.",00:03:48.130,00:03:49.840
Right?,00:03:49.840,00:03:50.470
So this is bounded.,00:03:50.470,00:03:51.970
"So this thing is going
to overpower these.",00:03:51.970,00:03:55.180
"And if you're curious,
you can graph it.",00:03:55.180,00:03:57.030
"This kind of forms an envelope
around these oscillations.",00:03:57.030,00:04:00.220
"So the limit, as this approaches
infinity, is going",00:04:00.220,00:04:03.110
to be equal to 0.,00:04:03.110,00:04:04.360
"And that makes sense, right?",00:04:07.780,00:04:08.450
"These are bounded between
0 and negative 1.",00:04:08.450,00:04:10.270
"And this approaches
0 very quickly.",00:04:10.270,00:04:13.750
"So it's 0 times something
bounded between 1",00:04:13.750,00:04:16.420
and negative 1.,00:04:16.420,00:04:17.540
"Another way to view it is the
largest value this could equal",00:04:17.540,00:04:21.360
"is 1 times whatever
coefficient's on it, and then",00:04:21.360,00:04:24.390
this is going to 0.,00:04:24.390,00:04:25.080
So it's like 0 times 1.,00:04:25.080,00:04:26.310
"Anyway, I don't want to focus
too much on that.",00:04:26.310,00:04:28.610
"You can play around with
that if you like.",00:04:28.610,00:04:30.830
"Minus this whole thing
evaluated at 0.",00:04:30.830,00:04:34.880
So what's e to the minus 0?,00:04:34.880,00:04:36.840
"Well, e to the minus 0 is 1.",00:04:36.840,00:04:40.840
Right?,00:04:40.840,00:04:41.310
That's e to the 0.,00:04:41.310,00:04:42.780
"We have a minus 1, so it becomes
plus 1 times-- now,",00:04:42.780,00:04:48.160
sine of 0 is 0.,00:04:48.160,00:04:51.370
"Minus 1 over s squared,
cosine of 0.",00:04:51.370,00:04:56.190
Let's see.,00:05:00.390,00:05:01.580
"Cosine of 0 is 1, so we have
minus 1 over s squared, minus",00:05:01.580,00:05:11.190
"1 over s squared, times 1.",00:05:11.190,00:05:14.230
"So that is equal to minus
1 over s squared.",00:05:14.230,00:05:23.720
"And I think I made a mistake,
because I shouldn't be having",00:05:23.720,00:05:27.100
a negative number here.,00:05:27.100,00:05:28.270
So let's backtrack.,00:05:28.270,00:05:32.260
"Maybe this isn't a
negative number?",00:05:32.260,00:05:33.910
"Let's see, infinity, right?",00:05:33.910,00:05:36.310
This whole thing is 0.,00:05:36.310,00:05:39.660
"When when you put 0 here,
this becomes a minus 1.",00:05:39.660,00:05:44.800
Yeah.,00:05:44.800,00:05:47.460
"So either this is a plus
or this is a plus.",00:05:47.460,00:05:49.750
"Let's see where I
made my mistake.",00:05:49.750,00:05:52.480
"e to the minus st-- oh, I
see where my mistake is.",00:05:52.480,00:05:58.130
Right up here.,00:05:58.130,00:05:59.650
"Where I factored out a minus
e to the minus st, right?",00:05:59.650,00:06:04.650
Fair enough.,00:06:04.650,00:06:05.270
"So that makes this 1
over s, sine of at.",00:06:05.270,00:06:07.920
"But if I factor out a minus e to
the minus st, this becomes",00:06:07.920,00:06:10.840
"a plus, right?",00:06:10.840,00:06:13.680
"It was a minus here, but I'm
factoring out of a minus e to",00:06:13.680,00:06:16.005
the minus st.,00:06:16.005,00:06:16.980
So that's a plus.,00:06:16.980,00:06:18.420
This is a plus.,00:06:18.420,00:06:20.160
"Boy, I'm glad that was not
too difficult to find.",00:06:20.160,00:06:22.470
So then this becomes a plus.,00:06:22.470,00:06:24.170
And then this becomes a plus.,00:06:24.170,00:06:25.550
Thank God.,00:06:25.550,00:06:26.165
"It would have been sad if I
wasted two videos and ended up",00:06:26.165,00:06:29.420
"with a careless, negative
number.",00:06:29.420,00:06:31.030
Anyway.,00:06:31.030,00:06:31.470
"So now we have s squared plus
a squared, over s squared,",00:06:31.470,00:06:39.660
times y is equal to this.,00:06:39.660,00:06:41.880
"Multiply both sides times
s squared over-- s",00:06:41.880,00:06:44.480
squared plus a squared.,00:06:44.480,00:06:45.010
"Divide both sides by this, and
we get y is equal to 1 over s",00:06:45.010,00:06:49.420
"squared-- And actually, let me
make sure that that is right.",00:06:49.420,00:06:56.570
It's 1 over s squared.,00:06:56.570,00:06:59.870
"y is equal to 1 over s squared,
times s squared, over",00:06:59.870,00:07:07.980
s squared plus a squared.,00:07:07.980,00:07:10.760
And then these cancel out.,00:07:10.760,00:07:12.570
"And let me make sure
that I haven't made",00:07:12.570,00:07:14.090
another careless mistake.,00:07:14.090,00:07:16.202
Because I have a,00:07:16.202,00:07:16.750
feeling I have. Yep.,00:07:16.750,00:07:22.970
There.,00:07:22.970,00:07:23.360
I see the careless mistake.,00:07:23.360,00:07:25.150
And it was all in this term.,00:07:25.150,00:07:28.090
"And I hope you don't mind my
careless mistakes, but I want",00:07:28.090,00:07:30.010
"you to see that I'm doing these
things in real time and",00:07:30.010,00:07:33.720
"I am human, in case you haven't
realized already.",00:07:33.720,00:07:37.470
"Anyway, so I made the same
careless mistake.",00:07:37.470,00:07:40.600
"So I factor out an e to the
minus st here, so it's plus.",00:07:40.600,00:07:45.410
But it was a over s squared.,00:07:45.410,00:07:47.310
So this is an a.,00:07:47.310,00:07:49.290
That's an a.,00:07:49.290,00:07:50.720
And so this is an a.,00:07:50.720,00:07:53.640
And so this is an a.,00:07:53.640,00:07:56.370
And so this is an a.,00:07:56.370,00:07:58.470
Right?,00:07:58.470,00:07:58.740
This was an a.,00:07:58.740,00:08:01.640
"And this is the correct
answer.",00:08:01.640,00:08:03.730
"a over s squared
plus a squared.",00:08:03.730,00:08:07.120
"So I hope those careless
mistakes didn't",00:08:07.120,00:08:09.360
throw you off too much.,00:08:09.360,00:08:11.910
"These things happen when you do
integration by parts twice",00:08:11.910,00:08:14.490
with a bunch of variables.,00:08:14.490,00:08:15.840
"But anyway, now we are ready
to add a significant entry",00:08:15.840,00:08:19.430
"into our table of Laplace
transforms. And that is that",00:08:19.430,00:08:23.600
"the Laplace transform-- I had
an extra curl, there.",00:08:23.600,00:08:26.860
That was unecessary.,00:08:26.860,00:08:27.520
Let me do it again.,00:08:27.520,00:08:28.740
"The Laplace transform of sine
of at is equal to a over s",00:08:28.740,00:08:40.230
"squared, plus a squared.",00:08:40.230,00:08:43.159
"And that's a significant
entry.",00:08:43.159,00:08:45.210
"And maybe a good exercise for
you, just to see how fun it is",00:08:45.210,00:08:48.100
"to do these integration by parts
problems twice, is to",00:08:48.100,00:08:51.070
"figure out the Laplace transform
of cosine of at.",00:08:51.070,00:08:55.390
And I'll give you a hint.,00:08:55.390,00:08:56.240
"It's s over s squared over
s squared plus a squared.",00:08:56.240,00:09:00.410
"And it's nice that there's
that symmetry there.",00:09:00.410,00:09:02.620
"Anyway, I'm almost
at my time limit.",00:09:02.620,00:09:05.330
"And I'm very tired working
on this video.",00:09:05.330,00:09:08.850
"So I'll leave it there and I'll
see you in the next one.",00:09:08.850,00:09:12.360
