- [Voiceover] Let's say that we have,00:00:00.428,00:00:01.795
"the differential equation
dy dx or the derivative",00:00:01.795,00:00:05.536
"of y with respect to x is
equal to negative x over y.",00:00:05.536,00:00:10.536
"Let's say we don't know how
to find the solutions to this,",00:00:11.519,00:00:14.844
but we at least want to get a sense,00:00:14.844,00:00:16.845
of what the solutions might look like.,00:00:16.944,00:00:19.012
"And to do that what we
could do is we could look",00:00:19.441,00:00:22.337
"at a coordinate plane, so
let me draw some axes here.",00:00:22.337,00:00:26.811
"So let me draw relatively
straight line alright.",00:00:27.305,00:00:31.171
So that's my y-axis and this is my x-axis.,00:00:31.459,00:00:36.288
"Let me mark this as one, that's
two, that's negative one,",00:00:38.826,00:00:43.820
"negative two, one, two,
negative one, and negative two.",00:00:43.082,00:00:48.082
"And what I could do is since
this differential equation",00:00:51.304,00:00:54.210
"is just in terms of xs and
ys and first derivatives",00:00:54.021,00:00:57.962
"of y with respect to x, I
could sample points on the",00:00:58.151,00:01:02.476
"coordinate plane, I could look
at the x and y coordinates",00:01:02.476,00:01:05.382
"substitute them in here, figure out",00:01:05.382,00:01:07.079
what the slope is going to be.,00:01:07.079,00:01:08.686
"And then I could visualize
the slope if a solution",00:01:08.686,00:01:11.323
"goes through that point what
the slope needs to be there",00:01:11.323,00:01:14.161
"and I can visualize that
with a line segment,",00:01:14.161,00:01:16.176
a little small line segment that has,00:01:16.176,00:01:17.642
the same slope as the slope in question.,00:01:17.642,00:01:20.364
So let's actually do that.,00:01:20.784,00:01:22.745
So let me setup a little table here.,00:01:23.175,00:01:24.926
I'm going to do a little table here,00:01:25.978,00:01:27.083
to do a bunch of x and y values.,00:01:27.083,00:01:29.110
Once again I'm just sampling some points,00:01:29.011,00:01:30.455
"on the coordinate plane
to be able to visualize.",00:01:30.554,00:01:32.647
"So x, y and this is dy dx.",00:01:33.133,00:01:38.133
"So let's say when x is zero and y is one,",00:01:38.983,00:01:43.983
"what is the derivative
of y with respect to x?",00:01:44.979,00:01:47.137
It's going to be negative zero over one,00:01:47.453,00:01:49.017
so it's just going to be zero.,00:01:49.017,00:01:50.814
"And so at the point zero one
if a solution goes through",00:01:51.387,00:01:54.543
this point its slope is going to be zero.,00:01:54.543,00:01:57.740
"And so we can visualize
that by doing a little",00:01:57.977,00:02:00.480
horizontal line segment right there.,00:02:00.048,00:02:02.317
So let's keep going.,00:02:03.159,00:02:04.412
What about when x is one and y is one?,00:02:04.697,00:02:08.860
"Well then dy dx, the derivative
of y with respect to x",00:02:09.634,00:02:12.138
"is negative one over one, so
it's going to be negative one.",00:02:12.138,00:02:15.390
"So at the point one comma
one if a solution goes",00:02:15.781,00:02:19.377
"through that point, it would
have a slope of negative one.",00:02:19.377,00:02:24.377
And so I draw a little line segment,00:02:26.236,00:02:27.558
that has a slope of negative one.,00:02:27.558,00:02:29.436
Let me do this in a new color.,00:02:31.358,00:02:33.071
What about when x is one and y is zero?,00:02:33.071,00:02:36.693
"Well then it's negative one over zero,",00:02:37.041,00:02:40.656
"so this is actually
undefined, but it's a clue",00:02:41.025,00:02:44.726
"that maybe the slope there
if you had a tangent line",00:02:44.726,00:02:49.501
"at that point, maybe it's vertical.",00:02:49.501,00:02:51.472
"So I'll put that as a
question mark, vertical there.",00:02:51.472,00:02:56.472
"So maybe it's something
like that if you actually",00:02:56.887,00:02:59.936
"did have, I guess it
wouldn't be a function,",00:03:00.377,00:03:02.378
"if you had some kind of
relation that went through it,",00:03:02.477,00:03:05.208
but let's not draw that just yet.,00:03:05.208,00:03:08.419
But let's try some other points.,00:03:08.419,00:03:09.815
"Let's try the point
negative one negative one.",00:03:12.728,00:03:16.434
"So now we have negative negative one,",00:03:17.303,00:03:20.325
"which is one, over negative one.",00:03:20.325,00:03:21.927
"Well you'd have a slope
of negative one here.",00:03:21.927,00:03:24.245
So negative one negative one,00:03:24.245,00:03:25.970
you'd have a slope of negative one.,00:03:25.097,00:03:30.097
What about if you had one negative one?,00:03:31.896,00:03:35.620
Well now it's negative one over,00:03:36.279,00:03:37.670
"negative one, your slope is now one.",00:03:37.067,00:03:39.278
"So one negative one, if a
solution goes through this",00:03:39.881,00:03:43.418
its slope would look like that.,00:03:43.418,00:03:46.097
"And we could keep going, we
could even do two negative two.",00:03:46.049,00:03:49.024
"That's going to have a
slope of one as well.",00:03:49.465,00:03:52.586
"If you did positive two positive two,",00:03:52.978,00:03:56.937
that would be negative two over two.,00:03:56.937,00:03:58.262
"You'd have a slope of
negative one right over here.",00:03:58.262,00:04:00.790
"And so we could do a bunch
of points, just keep going.",00:04:01.181,00:04:05.230
"Now I'm just doing them in my head,",00:04:05.023,00:04:06.855
I'm not going on the table.,00:04:07.062,00:04:08.284
"But you get a sense of
what's going on here.",00:04:08.284,00:04:10.272
"Here you're slope, what if
it was negative one one?",00:04:10.272,00:04:13.177
It's going to have a slope of one.,00:04:13.177,00:04:16.161
"So at this point your
slope negative one one",00:04:16.022,00:04:19.079
"so negative negative one is one over one,",00:04:19.079,00:04:21.236
so you're going to have a slope like that.,00:04:21.947,00:04:23.464
"At negative two two same exact idea,",00:04:23.464,00:04:26.332
it would look like that.,00:04:26.332,00:04:27.505
"And so when you keep
drawing these line segments",00:04:27.505,00:04:30.268
"over these kind of sample
points in the cartesian",00:04:30.268,00:04:33.351
"or in the x-y plane, you
start to get a sense of",00:04:33.351,00:04:37.023
well what would a solution have to do.,00:04:37.023,00:04:39.770
"And you can start to visualize
that hey maybe a solution",00:04:40.127,00:04:43.443
would have to do something like this.,00:04:44.464,00:04:49.464
"This would be a solution,
so maybe it would",00:04:49.501,00:04:52.820
have to do something like this.,00:04:52.082,00:04:53.731
"Or if we're looking only at
functions and not relations",00:04:54.469,00:04:58.861
I'll make it so it's very clear.,00:04:58.861,00:05:02.276
"So maybe it would have to
do something like this.",00:05:02.691,00:05:04.562
"Or if the function started
here based on what we've",00:05:04.562,00:05:09.006
"seen so far maybe it would
have to do something like this.",00:05:09.006,00:05:14.006
"Or if this were a point
on the function over here,",00:05:15.424,00:05:20.212
it would have to do something like this.,00:05:20.212,00:05:23.524
And once again I'm doing this based on,00:05:23.524,00:05:25.020
what the slope field is telling me.,00:05:25.002,00:05:27.336
"So this field that I'm
creating where I'm sampling",00:05:28.246,00:05:31.430
a bunch of points and I'm visualizing,00:05:31.043,00:05:32.531
the slope with a line segement.,00:05:32.918,00:05:34.635
Once again this is called a slope field.,00:05:34.635,00:05:39.635
So hopefully that gives you kind of,00:05:42.805,00:05:43.996
the basic idea of what a slope field is.,00:05:43.996,00:05:45.894
"And the next two videos we'll
explore this idea even deeper.",00:05:45.894,00:05:50.127
