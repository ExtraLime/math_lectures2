"In the last video we defined a
transformation that rotated",00:00:00.390,00:00:04.810
"any vector in R2 and just gave
us another rotated version of",00:00:04.810,00:00:09.160
that vector in R2.,00:00:09.160,00:00:11.200
"In this video, I'm essentially
going to extend this, so I'm",00:00:11.200,00:00:13.420
going to do it in R3.,00:00:13.420,00:00:14.750
"So I'm going to define a
rotation transformation.",00:00:14.750,00:00:17.895
I'll still call it theta.,00:00:21.550,00:00:23.220
"There's going to be a mapping
this time from R3 to R3.",00:00:23.220,00:00:28.360
"As you can imagine, the idea
of a rotation in an angle",00:00:28.360,00:00:30.820
"becomes a little bit more
complicated when we're dealing",00:00:30.820,00:00:32.940
in three dimensions.,00:00:32.940,00:00:33.970
"So in this case we're going to
rotate around the x-axis, let",00:00:33.970,00:00:38.205
"me call it-- so this is going
to rotate around the x-axis.",00:00:38.205,00:00:48.160
"And what we do in this video,
you can then just generalize",00:00:48.160,00:00:51.290
that to other axes.,00:00:51.290,00:00:52.530
"And if you want to rotate around
the x-axis, and then",00:00:52.530,00:00:54.950
"the y-axis, and then the z-axis
by different angles,",00:00:54.950,00:00:59.360
you can just apply the,00:00:59.360,00:01:00.160
transformations one after another.,00:01:00.160,00:01:01.580
"And we're going to cover that
in a lot more detail in a",00:01:01.580,00:01:04.040
future video.,00:01:04.040,00:01:04.989
"But this should kind of give you
the tools to show you that",00:01:04.989,00:01:07.210
"this idea that we learned in the
previous video is actually",00:01:07.210,00:01:10.820
"generalizeable to multiple
dimensions, and especially",00:01:10.820,00:01:13.170
three dimensions.,00:01:13.170,00:01:14.340
"So let me just be clear, what
we're going to be doing here.",00:01:14.340,00:01:18.060
Let me draw some axes.,00:01:18.060,00:01:19.910
That's my x-axis.,00:01:19.910,00:01:22.150
That is my y-axis.,00:01:22.150,00:01:24.550
And this is my z-axis.,00:01:24.550,00:01:28.730
"Of course, this is R3.",00:01:28.730,00:01:30.660
"But any vector here in R3
I will be rotating it",00:01:30.660,00:01:32.970
"counterclockwise around
the x-axis.",00:01:32.970,00:01:35.380
We'll be rotating like that.,00:01:35.380,00:01:37.850
"So if I had a vector-- I'm
just drawing it in the zy",00:01:37.850,00:01:41.520
"plane because it's a little bit
easier to visualize-- but",00:01:41.520,00:01:44.220
"if I have a vector sitting here
in the zy plane, it will",00:01:44.220,00:01:47.430
still stay in the zy plane.,00:01:47.430,00:01:48.760
"But it'll be rotated
counterclockwise by an angle",00:01:48.760,00:01:53.260
"of theta, just like that.",00:01:53.260,00:01:54.980
"Now, a little harder to
visualize is a vector that",00:01:54.980,00:01:57.490
"doesn't just sit in
the zy plane.",00:01:57.490,00:01:58.970
"If we have some vector that
has some x-component that",00:01:58.970,00:02:01.510
"comes out like that, then some
y-component and some",00:02:01.510,00:02:04.720
"z-component, it looks
like that.",00:02:04.720,00:02:07.020
"Then when you rotate it, its
z and its y-components will",00:02:07.020,00:02:10.650
"change, but its x-component
will stay the same.",00:02:10.650,00:02:13.330
"So then it might look
something like this.",00:02:13.330,00:02:17.020
"Let me see if I can
give it justice.",00:02:17.020,00:02:19.070
"So then the vector when I rotate
it around might look",00:02:19.070,00:02:22.030
something like that.,00:02:22.030,00:02:23.050
"Anyway, I don't know if I'm
giving it proper justice but",00:02:23.050,00:02:25.850
"this was rotated around
the x-axis.",00:02:25.850,00:02:28.100
"I think you understand
what that means.",00:02:28.100,00:02:29.920
"But just based on the last
video, we want to build a",00:02:29.920,00:02:32.340
transformation.,00:02:32.340,00:02:35.190
"Let me call this rotation
3 theta.",00:02:35.190,00:02:38.300
"Or let me call it 3 rotation
theta now that",00:02:38.300,00:02:41.260
we're dealing in R3.,00:02:41.260,00:02:42.970
"And what we want to do is we
want to find some matrix, so I",00:02:42.970,00:02:45.600
"can write my 3 rotation sub
theta transformation of x as",00:02:45.600,00:02:52.280
"being some matrix A times
the vector x.",00:02:52.280,00:02:55.650
"Since this is a transformation
from R3 to R3 this is of",00:02:55.650,00:03:00.060
"course going to be
a 3 by 3 matrix.",00:03:00.060,00:03:04.010
"Now in the last video we learned
that to figure this",00:03:04.010,00:03:06.970
"out, you just have to apply the
transformation essentially",00:03:06.970,00:03:09.580
to the identity matrix.,00:03:09.580,00:03:11.180
"So what we do is we start off
with the identity matrix in",00:03:11.180,00:03:14.950
"R3, which is just going
to be a 3 by 3.",00:03:14.950,00:03:17.330
"It's going to have 1, 1,
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.",00:03:21.040,00:03:28.330
"Each of these columns are the
basis vectors for R3.",00:03:28.330,00:03:32.090
"That's e1, e2, e3-- I'm writing
it probably too small",00:03:32.090,00:03:36.610
"for you to see-- but each
of these are the",00:03:36.610,00:03:38.290
basis vectors for R3.,00:03:38.290,00:03:40.260
"And what we need to do is just
apply the transformation to",00:03:40.260,00:03:42.730
"each of these basis
vectors in R3.",00:03:42.730,00:03:46.220
"So our matrix A will
look like this.",00:03:46.220,00:03:49.500
"Our matrix A is going to
be a 3 by 3 matrix.",00:03:49.500,00:03:53.220
"Where the first column
is going to be our",00:03:53.220,00:03:55.290
"transformation, 3 rotation sub
theta, applied to that column",00:03:55.290,00:04:01.910
"vector right there, 1, 0, 0.",00:04:01.910,00:04:05.770
"And then I'm going to apply it
to this middle column vector",00:04:05.770,00:04:09.050
right here.,00:04:09.050,00:04:11.790
"You get the idea, I don't
want to write",00:04:11.790,00:04:12.860
that whole thing again.,00:04:12.860,00:04:14.030
"I'm going to apply 3 rotation
sub theta to 0, 1, 0.",00:04:14.030,00:04:20.000
"And then I'm going to apply
it-- I'll do it here-- 3",00:04:20.000,00:04:23.135
rotation sub theta.,00:04:23.135,00:04:26.400
"I'm going to apply it
to this last column",00:04:26.400,00:04:28.130
"vector, so 0, 0, 1.",00:04:28.130,00:04:30.020
"We've seen this multiple
times.",00:04:30.020,00:04:31.790
So let's apply it.,00:04:31.790,00:04:32.930
"Let's rotate each of these
basis vectors for R3.",00:04:32.930,00:04:37.300
"Let's rotate them around
the x-axis.",00:04:37.300,00:04:40.650
"So the first guy, if I were
to draw an R3, what",00:04:40.650,00:04:44.730
would he look like?,00:04:44.730,00:04:45.690
"He only has directionality
in the x direction right?",00:04:45.690,00:04:49.150
"If we call this the x-dimension,
if the first",00:04:49.150,00:04:53.670
"entry corresponds to our
x-dimension, the second entry",00:04:53.670,00:04:57.210
"corresponds to our
y-dimension.",00:04:57.210,00:04:58.880
"And the third entry
corresponds to our",00:04:58.880,00:05:00.720
z-dimension.,00:05:00.720,00:05:03.360
"This vector would just be a unit
vector that just comes",00:05:03.360,00:05:05.930
"out like that, right?",00:05:05.930,00:05:07.710
"So if I'm going to rotate this
vector around the x-axis,",00:05:07.710,00:05:12.650
what's going to happen to it?,00:05:12.650,00:05:14.040
"Well, nothing.",00:05:14.040,00:05:16.320
It is the x-axis.,00:05:16.320,00:05:17.610
"So when you rotate it, it's not
changing its direction or",00:05:17.610,00:05:19.480
its magnitude or anything.,00:05:19.480,00:05:21.000
"So this vector right here
is just going to be the",00:05:21.000,00:05:25.650
"vector 1, 0, 0.",00:05:25.650,00:05:27.320
"Nothing happens when
you rotate it.",00:05:27.320,00:05:29.420
"Now these are a little
bit more interesting.",00:05:29.420,00:05:32.040
"To do these, let me just
draw my zy-axis.",00:05:32.040,00:05:35.940
Let me just draw my Z.,00:05:35.940,00:05:37.840
"So that's my z-axis and this
is my y-axis right here.",00:05:37.840,00:05:43.800
"Now this basis vector just goes
in the y direction by 1.",00:05:43.800,00:05:48.240
"So this basis vector just
looks like that.",00:05:48.240,00:05:52.690
And it has a length of 1.,00:05:52.690,00:05:55.520
"And then when you rotate it
around the x-axis, when I draw",00:05:55.520,00:05:58.255
"it like this, you could imagine
the x-axis is just",00:05:58.255,00:06:00.260
"popping out of your
computer screens.",00:06:00.260,00:06:02.490
"So I could draw it like this is
like the tip of the arrow",00:06:02.490,00:06:05.455
just popping out.,00:06:05.455,00:06:06.320
"Instead of drawing it at an
angle like this, I'm drawing",00:06:06.320,00:06:07.980
"it straight out of the
computer screen.",00:06:07.980,00:06:09.660
"So if you were to rotate this
vector right here, this blue",00:06:09.660,00:06:13.180
"vector right here, by
an angle of theta,",00:06:13.180,00:06:17.800
it'll look like this.,00:06:17.800,00:06:21.130
"And we've done this in
the previous video.",00:06:21.130,00:06:22.760
What are its new coordinates?,00:06:22.760,00:06:24.350
"First of all, will
its x-coordinate",00:06:24.350,00:06:25.890
have changed it all?,00:06:25.890,00:06:27.160
"It's x-coordinate was 0 before,
because it doesn't",00:06:27.160,00:06:30.270
"break out into the
x-dimension.",00:06:30.270,00:06:32.730
"It just stays along
the zy plane.",00:06:32.730,00:06:34.920
It was 0 before.,00:06:34.920,00:06:36.240
"When you rotate it, it's
still on a zy plane.",00:06:36.240,00:06:38.590
"So its x direction, or
its x-component,",00:06:38.590,00:06:41.870
won't change at all.,00:06:41.870,00:06:43.270
"So the x direction is
still going to be 0.",00:06:43.270,00:06:46.960
"And then what's its
new y direction?",00:06:46.960,00:06:49.530
"Well, here we do exactly what
we did in the last video.",00:06:49.530,00:06:52.590
"We figure out this is going to
be its new-- I guess I don't",00:06:52.590,00:06:56.830
"want to draw a vector there
necessarily-- but this length",00:06:56.830,00:06:59.330
"right here is going to be
its new y-component.",00:06:59.330,00:07:03.600
"And this length right here
is going to be its new",00:07:03.600,00:07:06.430
z-component.,00:07:06.430,00:07:08.200
So what's its new y-component?,00:07:08.200,00:07:11.440
"We did this in the last video
so I won't go into as much",00:07:11.440,00:07:14.270
"detail, but what is
cosine of theta?",00:07:14.270,00:07:18.320
"The length of this vector
is 1, right?",00:07:18.320,00:07:20.750
"These are the standard
basis vectors.",00:07:20.750,00:07:23.060
"And one of the things that makes
them a nice standard",00:07:23.060,00:07:25.490
"basis vector is that their
lengths are 1.",00:07:25.490,00:07:27.500
"So we know that the cosine of
this angle is equal to the",00:07:27.500,00:07:33.480
"adjacent side over
the hypotenuse.",00:07:33.480,00:07:35.870
"The adjacent side is
this right here.",00:07:35.870,00:07:38.140
And what is the hypotenuse?,00:07:38.140,00:07:39.310
It's equal to 1.,00:07:39.310,00:07:41.000
"So this adjacent side, which we
said is going to be our new",00:07:41.000,00:07:44.350
"second component, our second
entry, is going to be equal to",00:07:44.350,00:07:47.820
"cosine of theta, right?",00:07:47.820,00:07:49.500
That's A.,00:07:49.500,00:07:50.630
You can just ignore the 1's.,00:07:50.630,00:07:51.780
"This going to be equal
to cosine of theta.",00:07:51.780,00:07:55.180
"And what's going to be
its new z-component?",00:07:55.180,00:07:59.020
"Well, sine of theta is equal
to the opposite side, this",00:07:59.020,00:08:06.760
side over 1.,00:08:06.760,00:08:08.200
"So it just equals its
opposite side.",00:08:08.200,00:08:09.790
"And the length of that
opposite side is this",00:08:09.790,00:08:11.950
"vector's, once it's rotated,
is its new z-component.",00:08:11.950,00:08:16.190
"So you've got a sine
theta right there.",00:08:16.190,00:08:19.560
"Now we just have to do
everything in the z direction.",00:08:19.560,00:08:21.680
"So this z basis vector right
there, what does it look like",00:08:21.680,00:08:25.340
on this graph?,00:08:25.340,00:08:26.760
"Let me just actually redraw it
just to make things a little",00:08:26.760,00:08:28.850
bit cleaner.,00:08:28.850,00:08:30.400
"So that's my z-axis and
this is my y-axis.",00:08:30.400,00:08:35.650
"And my z-basis vector e3,
it starts off looking",00:08:35.650,00:08:40.600
something like that.,00:08:40.600,00:08:41.850
"It just goes only in
the z direction.",00:08:44.530,00:08:46.960
"So first of all, let's
just rotate it",00:08:46.960,00:08:48.530
by an angle of theta.,00:08:48.530,00:08:49.510
"So I'm going to rotate
it like that.",00:08:49.510,00:08:52.310
That's an angle of theta.,00:08:52.310,00:08:54.900
Its former x entry was 0.,00:08:54.900,00:08:57.430
"It did not break out in the
x direction at all.",00:08:57.430,00:09:00.410
"And of course we're still just
in the zy plane so it won't be",00:09:00.410,00:09:03.800
moving out in the x direction.,00:09:03.800,00:09:05.960
"So it's still going
to be a 0 up here.",00:09:05.960,00:09:08.650
"Now what about its
new y-component?",00:09:08.650,00:09:11.480
"Its new y-coordinate, I guess we
can call it, is going to be",00:09:11.480,00:09:15.960
"this length, or it's going to be
this coordinate right here.",00:09:15.960,00:09:18.290
"And how can we figure
that out?",00:09:18.290,00:09:19.710
"Well, that length is the same
thing as that length.",00:09:19.710,00:09:22.490
"And if we call this the opposite
side of the angle, we",00:09:22.490,00:09:25.740
"know that the sine of theta is
equal to this opposite side",00:09:25.740,00:09:31.400
"over the length of this vector,
which is just 1.",00:09:31.400,00:09:33.830
"So it's just equal to
the opposite side.",00:09:33.830,00:09:35.790
"So the opposite side is equal
to sine of theta.",00:09:35.790,00:09:37.970
"But our new coordinate is to
the left of the z-axis, so",00:09:37.970,00:09:41.246
"this is going to be a
negative version.",00:09:41.246,00:09:42.500
We did this in the last video.,00:09:42.500,00:09:43.695
"So it's just going to be a
negative sine of theta.",00:09:43.695,00:09:45.780
"This point right here,
that coordinate.",00:09:48.340,00:09:50.630
So it's minus sine of theta.,00:09:50.630,00:09:54.690
"And then finally, what's its new
z-coordinate going to be?",00:09:54.690,00:09:58.140
"That's going to be this
length right here.",00:09:58.140,00:10:00.310
"And we know that this length,
if we call that adjacent, we",00:10:00.310,00:10:02.850
"know that the cosine of
our theta is equal to",00:10:02.850,00:10:07.040
this divided by 1.,00:10:07.040,00:10:09.610
"So it's equal to that adjacent
side, so just put a cosine of",00:10:09.610,00:10:13.290
theta right there.,00:10:13.290,00:10:14.990
"And we get our transformation
matrix.",00:10:14.990,00:10:16.970
We're done.,00:10:16.970,00:10:18.410
"Our transformation
matrix A is this.",00:10:18.410,00:10:20.680
"So we can now say our new
transformation that",00:10:20.680,00:10:24.070
this video is about.,00:10:24.070,00:10:26.810
"I call it a 3 because it's
a rotation in R3.",00:10:26.810,00:10:30.810
"Maybe I should call it 3 sub X
because it's a rotation around",00:10:30.810,00:10:33.560
"the x-axis, but I think
you get the idea.",00:10:33.560,00:10:36.870
"It is equal to this matrix right
up here-- maybe I could",00:10:36.870,00:10:40.850
rewrite it.,00:10:40.850,00:10:42.230
Let me do it this way.,00:10:42.230,00:10:44.420
"Let me delete all of this so
I don't have to rewrite.",00:10:44.420,00:10:48.090
"So my transformation that this
videos is about, 3 rotation",00:10:48.090,00:10:54.250
"theta of x, that transformation
is equal to",00:10:54.250,00:10:57.500
"this matrix times whatever
vector x I have in R3.",00:10:57.500,00:11:02.870
"And you might say, hey, Sal,
that looks exactly like what",00:11:02.870,00:11:05.030
you did in the second.,00:11:05.030,00:11:06.220
"If you remember the last video
when we defined our rotation",00:11:06.220,00:11:09.580
"in R2, we had a transformation
matrix that looked very",00:11:09.580,00:11:13.260
similar to this.,00:11:13.260,00:11:14.400
"And that makes sense because
we're essentially just",00:11:14.400,00:11:16.610
rotating things,00:11:16.610,00:11:18.010
counterclockwise in the zy plane.,00:11:18.010,00:11:20.500
"Now you might say, hey, Sal,
why is this even useful?",00:11:20.500,00:11:22.530
"You extended it to three
dimensions or to R3, I saw",00:11:22.530,00:11:26.100
what you did in R2.,00:11:26.100,00:11:26.820
Why is this useful?,00:11:26.820,00:11:27.620
"It's kind of a limited case
where you're just rotating",00:11:27.620,00:11:29.610
around the x-axis.,00:11:29.610,00:11:30.460
And I did it for two reasons.,00:11:30.460,00:11:31.420
"One to show you that you
can generalize to R3.",00:11:31.420,00:11:34.860
"But the other thing is, if you
think about it, a lot of the",00:11:34.860,00:11:37.860
"rotations that you might want
to do in R3 can be described",00:11:37.860,00:11:41.260
"by a rotation around the x-axis
first-- which we did in",00:11:41.260,00:11:44.340
"this video-- then by rotation
around the y-axis and then",00:11:44.340,00:11:48.080
"maybe some rotation
around the z-axis.",00:11:48.080,00:11:51.860
"This is just a special case
where we're dealing with",00:11:51.860,00:11:57.340
rotation around the x-axis.,00:11:57.340,00:11:58.820
"But you could do the exact
same process to define",00:11:58.820,00:12:01.620
"transformation matrices for
rotations around the y-axis or",00:12:01.620,00:12:04.560
"the z-axis, and then you can
apply them one after another.",00:12:04.560,00:12:07.410
"And we'll talk a lot about that
in the future when we",00:12:07.410,00:12:09.460
start applying one,00:12:09.460,00:12:10.780
transformation after the other.,00:12:10.780,00:12:12.010
"But anyway, hopefully you found
this slightly useful.",00:12:12.010,00:12:14.170
"It's a slight extension
of what we did in R2.",00:12:14.170,00:12:16.660
