"PROFESSOR: Just a reminder,
drop day is tomorrow.",00:00:23.160,00:00:25.370
"So if you were thinking
about dropping the course",00:00:25.370,00:00:27.415
"or in danger of a bad
grade or something,",00:00:27.415,00:00:29.960
"tomorrow's the last
chance to bail out.",00:00:29.960,00:00:34.420
"Last time we began our
discussion on probability",00:00:34.420,00:00:36.660
"with the Monty Hall game--
the Monty Hall problem.",00:00:36.660,00:00:40.440
"And as part of the analysis,
we made assumptions",00:00:40.440,00:00:43.280
"of the form that given that
Carol placed the prize in box",00:00:43.280,00:00:48.580
"1, the probability that
the contestant chooses",00:00:48.580,00:00:52.440
box 1 is 1/3.,00:00:52.440,00:00:55.280
"Now, this is an
example of something",00:00:55.280,00:00:57.620
"that's called a
conditional probability.",00:00:57.620,00:01:00.589
"And that's what we're
going to study today.",00:01:00.589,00:01:02.380
"Now, in general,
you have something",00:01:13.930,00:01:16.170
"like the conditional
probability that an event, A,",00:01:16.170,00:01:19.950
"happens given that some
other event, B, has already",00:01:19.950,00:01:24.210
taken place.,00:01:24.210,00:01:25.770
"And you write that down as
a probability of A given B.",00:01:25.770,00:01:38.650
And both A and B are events.,00:01:38.650,00:01:39.945
"Now, the example
from Monty Hall--",00:01:44.190,00:01:46.665
"and actually, we had
several-- but you",00:01:46.665,00:01:48.870
"might have B being
the event that Carol",00:01:48.870,00:01:56.230
places the prize in box 1.,00:01:56.230,00:01:59.670
"And A might be the event that
the contestant chooses box 1.",00:02:03.820,00:02:17.300
"And we assumed for
the Monty Hall game",00:02:17.300,00:02:20.200
"that the probability of
A given B in this case",00:02:20.200,00:02:29.200
"was 1/3 third because
the contestant didn't",00:02:29.200,00:02:33.110
know where the prize was.,00:02:33.110,00:02:35.220
"Now in general, there's
a very simple formula",00:02:37.960,00:02:40.320
"to compute the probability
of A given B. In fact, we'll",00:02:40.320,00:02:44.974
treat it as a definition.,00:02:44.974,00:02:46.015
"Assuming the probability of B
is non-zero than the probability",00:02:48.920,00:02:55.700
"of A given B is just the
probability of A and B",00:02:55.700,00:03:03.440
"happening, both happening,
divided by the probability",00:03:03.440,00:03:07.860
of B happening.,00:03:07.860,00:03:10.700
"And you can see why this makes
sense when the picture-- say",00:03:10.700,00:03:15.620
this is our sample space.,00:03:15.620,00:03:18.560
"And let this be the
event, A, and this",00:03:18.560,00:03:22.370
"be the event, B. Now we're
conditioning on the fact",00:03:22.370,00:03:28.440
that B happened.,00:03:28.440,00:03:31.110
"Now once we've
conditioned on that,",00:03:31.110,00:03:33.360
"all this stuff outside of
B is no longer possible.",00:03:33.360,00:03:37.320
"All those outcomes are no longer
in the space of consideration.",00:03:37.320,00:03:42.930
"The only outcomes left
are in B. So in some sense",00:03:42.930,00:03:45.850
"we've shrunk the
sample space to be B.",00:03:45.850,00:03:49.050
"And all we care about is the
probability that A happens",00:03:49.050,00:03:52.660
inside this new sample space.,00:03:52.660,00:03:55.410
"And that is, we're asking the
probability 1 of these outcomes",00:03:55.410,00:03:58.950
"happens given that this
is the sample space.",00:03:58.950,00:04:03.040
"Well, this is just A
intersect B because you still",00:04:03.040,00:04:07.160
"have to have A happen, but
now you're inside of B.",00:04:07.160,00:04:09.650
"And then we divide
by probability of B.",00:04:09.650,00:04:13.530
"So we normalize this
to be probability one.",00:04:13.530,00:04:17.150
OK.,00:04:17.150,00:04:17.649
"Because we're
saying B happened--",00:04:17.649,00:04:19.490
we're conditioning on that.,00:04:19.490,00:04:20.970
"Therefore, the probability
of these outcomes must be 1.",00:04:20.970,00:04:24.680
"So we divide by the probability
of B. So we normalize.",00:04:24.680,00:04:28.660
"This now becomes-- the
probability of A given B",00:04:28.660,00:04:31.290
"is this share of B
weighted by the outcomes.",00:04:31.290,00:04:36.310
OK.,00:04:36.310,00:04:36.810
All right.,00:04:39.020,00:04:39.520
"For example then, what's the
probability of B given B?",00:04:39.520,00:04:45.410
what's that equal?,00:04:47.970,00:04:49.740
1.,00:04:49.740,00:04:50.700
OK.,00:04:50.700,00:04:51.470
"Because we said it happened-- so
it happens with probability 1.",00:04:51.470,00:04:54.406
"Or, using the formula, that's
just probability of B and B",00:04:54.406,00:04:58.890
"divided by probability
of B. Well, that",00:04:58.890,00:05:01.890
"equals the probability
of B divided",00:05:01.890,00:05:05.470
"by the probability
of B, which is 1.",00:05:05.470,00:05:09.511
All right.,00:05:09.511,00:05:10.010
"Any questions about
the definition",00:05:10.010,00:05:13.010
of the conditional probability?,00:05:13.010,00:05:15.970
Very simple.,00:05:15.970,00:05:16.500
"And it's easy to work
with using the formulas.",00:05:16.500,00:05:20.130
"Now, there's a nice
rule called the product",00:05:20.130,00:05:22.850
"rule, which follows from
the definition very simply.",00:05:22.850,00:05:25.635
"The product rule says that
the probability of A and B",00:05:31.600,00:05:35.450
"for two events is equal
to the probability of B",00:05:35.450,00:05:40.290
"times the probability
of A given B.",00:05:40.290,00:05:44.880
"And that's just follow
straightforwardly",00:05:44.880,00:05:47.060
from this definition.,00:05:47.060,00:05:49.700
"Just multiply by probability
of B on both sides.",00:05:49.700,00:05:53.750
All right.,00:05:53.750,00:05:54.250
"So now you have a
rule of computing",00:05:54.250,00:05:55.708
"a probability of two events
simultaneously happening.",00:05:55.708,00:05:59.750
"So for example, in the
Monty Hall problem,",00:05:59.750,00:06:03.460
"what's the probability
that Carol places",00:06:03.460,00:06:06.190
"the prize in box one and that's
the box the contestant chooses?",00:06:06.190,00:06:11.840
All right?,00:06:11.840,00:06:12.340
"So if we took A and B
as defined up there,",00:06:12.340,00:06:15.650
"that's the probability that
Carol places it in box one",00:06:15.650,00:06:18.880
and the contestant chose it.,00:06:18.880,00:06:22.090
"Well, that's the probability
that the contestant chooses",00:06:22.090,00:06:24.500
"it is 1/3 times the probability
that Carol put it there,",00:06:24.500,00:06:28.740
"given the contestant chose
it, or actually, vice versa,",00:06:28.740,00:06:33.130
Is 1/9.,00:06:33.130,00:06:36.282
OK?,00:06:36.282,00:06:38.430
And this extends to more events.,00:06:38.430,00:06:40.275
"It is called the
general product rule.",00:06:42.870,00:06:44.830
"So if you want to compute
the probability of A1 and A2",00:06:55.500,00:07:02.170
"and all the way up to An, that's
simply the probability of a 1",00:07:02.170,00:07:08.840
"happening all by itself times
the probability of A2 given A1",00:07:08.840,00:07:17.760
"times-- well, I'll do the next
one-- times the probability",00:07:17.760,00:07:20.350
"of A3 given A1 and A2, dot,
dot dot, times, finally,",00:07:20.350,00:07:29.750
"the probability of An
given all the others.",00:07:29.750,00:07:32.940
"So that starts to look a
little more complicated.",00:07:40.730,00:07:43.360
"But it gives you a handy way
of computing the probability",00:07:43.360,00:07:46.720
"that an intersection
of events takes place.",00:07:46.720,00:07:48.565
"I do This is proved by induction
on n, just taking that rule",00:07:51.080,00:07:54.639
and using induction on n.,00:07:54.639,00:07:55.680
It's not hard.,00:07:55.680,00:07:56.690
But we won't go through it.,00:07:56.690,00:07:59.810
All right.,00:07:59.810,00:08:00.310
Let's do some examples.,00:08:00.310,00:08:02.770
We'll start with an easy one.,00:08:02.770,00:08:04.070
"Say you're playing
a playoff series",00:08:07.750,00:08:11.670
"and you're going to
play best 2 out of 3.",00:08:11.670,00:08:13.430
All right.,00:08:13.430,00:08:15.358
"So you have a best
2 out of 3 series.",00:08:15.358,00:08:22.210
"So whoever wins the first two
games, best two out of three",00:08:22.210,00:08:25.350
wins.,00:08:25.350,00:08:27.590
"And say you're told that
the probability of winning",00:08:27.590,00:08:32.210
the first game is 1/2.,00:08:32.210,00:08:33.570
"So the teams are matched
50-50 for the first game.",00:08:44.450,00:08:48.560
"But then you're told that the
probability of winning a game",00:08:48.560,00:08:53.020
after a victory is higher.,00:08:53.020,00:08:55.590
It's 2/3.,00:08:55.590,00:08:56.165
"So the probability of
winning immediately",00:09:02.000,00:09:09.700
"after a game following
a win is two thirds.",00:09:09.700,00:09:22.190
"And similarly, the probability
of winning after a loss is 1/3.",00:09:22.190,00:09:26.540
All right.,00:09:43.370,00:09:43.870
"And the idea here is
that you win a game,",00:09:43.870,00:09:46.000
"you're sort of psyched,
you've got momentum,",00:09:46.000,00:09:47.860
"and going into the next day
you're more likely to win.",00:09:47.860,00:09:50.870
"Similarly, if you lost
you're sort of down",00:09:50.870,00:09:52.730
"and the other guy has a
better chance of beating you.",00:09:52.730,00:09:55.250
"Now, what we're going
to try to figure out",00:09:55.250,00:09:57.630
"is the probability
of winning the series",00:09:57.630,00:10:01.940
given you won the first game.,00:10:01.940,00:10:05.450
All right?,00:10:05.450,00:10:05.950
"Now, conditional
probability comes up",00:10:05.950,00:10:08.100
in two places in this problem.,00:10:08.100,00:10:11.540
"Anybody tell me places
where it's come up?",00:10:11.540,00:10:13.720
"So I got the problem statement
and the that's the goal",00:10:13.720,00:10:15.970
"is to figure out the probability
you win the series given",00:10:15.970,00:10:17.870
you won the first game.,00:10:17.870,00:10:18.828
"So what's one place
conditional probability",00:10:18.828,00:10:21.030
is entering into this problem?,00:10:21.030,00:10:24.880
Yeah?,00:10:24.880,00:10:26.140
"AUDIENCE: The
probability changes",00:10:26.140,00:10:27.550
"depending on the result
of the previous game.",00:10:27.550,00:10:31.252
PROFESSOR: That's true.,00:10:31.252,00:10:32.210
"The probability of winning
any particular game",00:10:32.210,00:10:34.270
"is influenced by
the previous game.",00:10:34.270,00:10:35.910
"So you're using conditional
probability there.",00:10:35.910,00:10:38.780
All right.,00:10:38.780,00:10:40.140
And where else?,00:10:40.140,00:10:41.860
Yeah.,00:10:41.860,00:10:42.546
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you have to take",00:10:42.546,00:10:46.434
into account [INAUDIBLE].,00:10:46.434,00:10:48.100
PROFESSOR: That's interesting.,00:10:48.100,00:10:49.350
"That will be another question
we're going to look at.",00:10:49.350,00:10:51.558
"What's the probability
of playing three games?",00:10:51.558,00:10:54.050
Yep.,00:10:54.050,00:10:55.340
That's one.,00:10:55.340,00:10:57.521
OK.,00:10:57.521,00:10:58.020
"Well, the question
we're after, what's",00:10:58.020,00:11:00.410
"the probability of
winning the series given",00:11:00.410,00:11:02.310
that you won the first game.,00:11:02.310,00:11:04.040
"We're going to compute a
conditional probability there.",00:11:04.040,00:11:07.040
"So it's coming up in a
couple of places here.",00:11:07.040,00:11:09.954
All right.,00:11:09.954,00:11:10.870
Let's figure this out.,00:11:10.870,00:11:12.650
"It's easy to do given
the tree method.",00:11:12.650,00:11:16.710
So let's make the tree for this.,00:11:16.710,00:11:19.610
"So we have possibly three games
there's game one, game two,",00:11:19.610,00:11:27.300
and game three.,00:11:27.300,00:11:28.190
"Game one, you can win or lose.",00:11:31.060,00:11:32.910
There's two branches.,00:11:32.910,00:11:36.560
Game two you can win or lose.,00:11:36.560,00:11:38.135
"And now, game three-- well, it
doesn't even take place here.",00:11:41.350,00:11:46.650
But it does here.,00:11:46.650,00:11:47.450
You can win or lose here.,00:11:47.450,00:11:50.800
And you could win or lose here.,00:11:50.800,00:11:54.520
And here the series is over.,00:11:54.520,00:11:56.120
"So there is no game
three in that case.",00:11:56.120,00:12:00.040
"The probabilities are
next we put a probability",00:12:00.040,00:12:03.030
of every branch here.,00:12:03.030,00:12:04.900
Game one is 50-50.,00:12:04.900,00:12:05.820
"What's the probability
you take this branch?",00:12:08.207,00:12:10.040
"2/3, because you're on the path
where you won the first game.",00:12:13.530,00:12:17.170
"You win the second
game with 2/3.",00:12:17.170,00:12:18.760
You lose with 1/3.,00:12:18.760,00:12:21.540
"Now here you're on the path
where you lost the first game.",00:12:21.540,00:12:25.020
"So this has 1/3
and this has 2/3.",00:12:25.020,00:12:29.931
All right?,00:12:29.931,00:12:30.430
"And then lastly, what's
the probability I have",00:12:30.430,00:12:32.510
the win on the third game here?,00:12:32.510,00:12:39.060
"1/3, because I just
lost the last game.",00:12:39.060,00:12:42.150
That's all I'm conditioning on.,00:12:42.150,00:12:44.220
So that becomes 1/3.,00:12:44.220,00:12:46.250
And this is 2/3 now.,00:12:46.250,00:12:49.150
And then here I just won a game.,00:12:49.150,00:12:50.770
So I've got 2/3 and 1/3.,00:12:50.770,00:12:54.386
All right.,00:12:54.386,00:12:55.290
So I got all the probabilities.,00:12:55.290,00:12:57.890
"And now I need to figure out
for the sample points what's",00:12:57.890,00:13:02.870
their probability.,00:13:02.870,00:13:03.730
"So this sample point
we'll call win-win.",00:13:03.730,00:13:07.760
"This sample point
is win-lose-win.",00:13:07.760,00:13:11.176
This one's win-lose-lose.,00:13:15.089,00:13:16.130
"Then we have lose-win-win,
lose-win-lose,",00:13:20.130,00:13:27.780
and then lose-lose.,00:13:27.780,00:13:30.040
So I got six sample points.,00:13:30.040,00:13:32.010
"And let's figure out the
probability for each one.",00:13:32.010,00:13:35.430
"Now remember the rule we
had for the tree method.",00:13:35.430,00:13:39.280
I just multiply these things.,00:13:39.280,00:13:42.570
"Well, in fact, the
reason we have that rule",00:13:42.570,00:13:44.820
"is because that is the
same as the product rule.",00:13:44.820,00:13:49.120
"Because what I'm
asking here to compute",00:13:49.120,00:13:50.830
"the probability of this guy
is-- so the product rule gives",00:13:50.830,00:14:03.210
"the probability of a win-win
scenario-- win the first game,",00:14:03.210,00:14:07.700
win the second game.,00:14:07.700,00:14:09.420
"By the product rule
is the probability",00:14:09.420,00:14:11.210
"that I win the first game
times the probability",00:14:11.210,00:14:16.580
"that I win the second game
given that I won the first game.",00:14:16.580,00:14:23.570
"That's what the
product rule says.",00:14:23.570,00:14:27.280
"Probability I win the
first game is 1/2 times",00:14:27.280,00:14:31.590
"the probability I
win the second given",00:14:31.590,00:14:33.480
that I won the first is 2/3.,00:14:33.480,00:14:37.590
So that equals 1/3.,00:14:37.590,00:14:40.270
"So what we're doing
here now is giving you",00:14:45.641,00:14:47.390
"the formal justification for
that rule that we had last time",00:14:47.390,00:14:51.270
"and that you'll always use--
is the probability of a sample",00:14:51.270,00:14:53.770
"point is the product
of the probabilities",00:14:53.770,00:14:56.320
on the edges leading to it.,00:14:56.320,00:14:59.100
It's just the product rule.,00:14:59.100,00:15:00.310
"Now the next
example is this one.",00:15:00.310,00:15:03.260
"And here we're going to use the
general product rule to get it.",00:15:03.260,00:15:06.155
"The probability of win-lose-win
by the general product rule",00:15:09.190,00:15:16.160
"is the probability that
you win the first game",00:15:16.160,00:15:20.440
"times the probability you
lose the second game given",00:15:20.440,00:15:24.820
"the that you win the first
times the probability you",00:15:24.820,00:15:30.640
win the third given what?,00:15:30.640,00:15:34.786
"What am I given on
the product rule?",00:15:34.786,00:15:38.740
"Won the first, lost the second.",00:15:38.740,00:15:43.582
All right.,00:15:43.582,00:15:44.419
"Well, now we can
fill in the numbers.",00:15:44.419,00:15:45.960
"The probability I win
the first is a 1/2.",00:15:45.960,00:15:49.768
"The probability that
I lose the second",00:15:49.768,00:15:52.740
"given that I won the
first, that's 1/3.",00:15:52.740,00:15:57.720
"And then this one
here, the probability",00:15:57.720,00:15:59.440
"that I win the third
given that I won the first",00:15:59.440,00:16:01.680
"and lost the second,
that simplifies",00:16:01.680,00:16:04.600
"the probability I win the third
given that I lost the second.",00:16:04.600,00:16:09.160
"Doesn't matter what
happened on the first.",00:16:09.160,00:16:11.795
And that's 1/3.,00:16:11.795,00:16:12.420
"So this is 1/2 times
1/3 times 1/3 is 118.",00:16:16.010,00:16:24.650
And that's 1/18.,00:16:24.650,00:16:28.090
"And it's just the product
because the product rule",00:16:28.090,00:16:31.480
"saying product of
the first probability",00:16:31.480,00:16:35.290
"times this one, which is
the conditional probability",00:16:35.290,00:16:37.910
"of being here times
this one, which",00:16:37.910,00:16:40.080
"is a conditional probability if
these events happened before.",00:16:40.080,00:16:45.600
Any questions about that?,00:16:45.600,00:16:49.180
"Very simple to
do, which is good.",00:16:49.180,00:16:51.240
Yeah.,00:16:51.240,00:16:51.740
Is there a question?,00:16:51.740,00:16:53.590
OK.,00:16:53.590,00:16:54.090
All right.,00:16:54.090,00:16:54.714
"So let's fill in the
other probabilities here.",00:16:54.714,00:16:56.630
"I got 1/2, 1/3, and 2/3.",00:16:56.630,00:16:59.500
That's 1/9.,00:16:59.500,00:17:01.820
Same thing here is 1/9.,00:17:01.820,00:17:04.650
This is 1/18 and 1/3.,00:17:04.650,00:17:08.670
OK.,00:17:12.069,00:17:12.569
"So those are the probabilities
in the sample points.",00:17:12.569,00:17:15.319
"Now, to compute the probability
of winning the series given",00:17:15.319,00:17:20.119
"that we won the first game,
let's define the events here.",00:17:20.119,00:17:23.124
"So A be the event that
we win the series.",00:17:26.890,00:17:32.355
"B will be the event that
we win the first game.",00:17:36.220,00:17:42.420
"And I want to compute the
probability of A given B.",00:17:45.580,00:17:50.560
And we use our formula.,00:17:50.560,00:17:53.020
Where's the formula for that?,00:17:53.020,00:17:54.825
It's way back over there.,00:17:54.825,00:17:56.170
"The probability of A
given B is the probability",00:17:56.170,00:17:59.210
"of both happening, the
probability of A and B",00:17:59.210,00:18:04.710
divided by the probability of B.,00:18:04.710,00:18:09.450
"So now I just have to
compute these probabilities.",00:18:09.450,00:18:13.620
"So to do that I got to figure
out which sample points are",00:18:13.620,00:18:16.700
in A and B here.,00:18:16.700,00:18:20.820
So let's write that down.,00:18:20.820,00:18:22.030
"There's A, B, A
and B. All right.",00:18:22.030,00:18:27.750
"So A is the event that
we win the series.",00:18:27.750,00:18:32.780
"Now this sample point qualifies,
that one does, and this one.",00:18:35.670,00:18:42.910
"B is the event we
won the first game.",00:18:42.910,00:18:44.530
"And that's these
three sample points.",00:18:44.530,00:18:48.360
"And then A and B
intersect B is these two.",00:18:48.360,00:18:54.521
All right.,00:18:54.521,00:18:55.020
"So for each event
that I care about",00:18:55.020,00:18:56.560
"I figure out which sample
points are in that event.",00:18:56.560,00:18:58.684
"And now I just add
the probabilities up.",00:19:01.370,00:19:05.570
"So what's the
probability of A and B?",00:19:05.570,00:19:08.740
7/18.,00:19:17.400,00:19:19.070
1/3 plus 1/18.,00:19:19.070,00:19:19.750
What's the probability of B?,00:19:24.810,00:19:26.165
Yeah.,00:19:30.661,00:19:31.160
"1/2, 9/18.",00:19:31.160,00:19:32.330
I got these three points.,00:19:32.330,00:19:33.430
"So this'll be 1/3 third plus
1/18 plus the extra one, 1/9.",00:19:37.070,00:19:43.770
So I've got 7/18 over 9/18.,00:19:43.770,00:19:49.340
7/9 is the answer.,00:19:49.340,00:19:52.640
"So the probability
we win the Series",00:19:52.640,00:19:54.470
"given we won the
first game is 7/9.",00:19:54.470,00:19:56.370
Any questions?,00:19:59.032,00:19:59.615
"We're going to do this same
thing about 10 different times.",00:20:03.050,00:20:06.090
OK?,00:20:06.090,00:20:06.850
"And it will look a little
different each time maybe.",00:20:06.850,00:20:09.170
But it's the same idea.,00:20:09.170,00:20:10.250
"And the beauty here is
it's really easy to do.",00:20:10.250,00:20:13.780
"I'm going to give you a
lot of confusing examples.",00:20:13.780,00:20:16.400
"But really, if you just do this
is it's going to be very easy.",00:20:16.400,00:20:20.696
All right.,00:20:20.696,00:20:21.220
"Somebody talked about the
series lasting three games.",00:20:21.220,00:20:24.670
"What's the probability the
series lasts three games?",00:20:24.670,00:20:27.722
"Can anybody look at
that and tell me?",00:20:27.722,00:20:29.712
"1/3 because what you would do
is add up these three sample",00:20:33.410,00:20:37.310
points.,00:20:37.310,00:20:39.100
"And it's the opposite
of these two.",00:20:39.100,00:20:41.910
"So it's 2/3 chance of two games,
a 1/3 chance of three games.",00:20:41.910,00:20:45.690
"So it's not likely
to go three games.",00:20:45.690,00:20:49.910
All right.,00:20:49.910,00:20:51.640
"So to this point,
we've seen examples",00:20:51.640,00:20:54.860
"of a conditional
probability where",00:20:54.860,00:20:56.830
"it's A given B where A follows
B, like, we're told B happened.",00:20:56.830,00:21:03.570
"Now what's the chance of
A. And A is coming later.",00:21:03.570,00:21:07.370
"The probability of
winning today's game",00:21:07.370,00:21:09.990
"given that you won yesterday's
game, the probability",00:21:09.990,00:21:12.950
"of winning the series given
you already won the first game.",00:21:12.950,00:21:17.770
"Next, we're going to look
at the opposite scenario",00:21:17.770,00:21:21.140
"where the events are
reversed in order.",00:21:21.140,00:21:24.320
"The probability that
you won the first game",00:21:24.320,00:21:28.240
given that you won the series.,00:21:28.240,00:21:32.294
All right.,00:21:32.294,00:21:33.120
"Now, this is
inherently confusing",00:21:33.120,00:21:37.140
"because if you're
trying to figure--",00:21:37.140,00:21:40.170
"if you know you
the series, well,",00:21:40.170,00:21:43.360
"you already know what
happened in the first game",00:21:43.360,00:21:45.370
because it's been played.,00:21:45.370,00:21:47.270
"So how could there be
any probability there?",00:21:47.270,00:21:49.270
It happened.,00:21:49.270,00:21:51.240
"Well, so what the meaning
is is over all the times",00:21:51.240,00:21:54.460
"where the series
was played, sort",00:21:54.460,00:21:56.862
"of what fraction of
the time did the team",00:21:56.862,00:21:58.570
"that won the series win
the first game is one",00:21:58.570,00:22:00.760
way you could think about it.,00:22:00.760,00:22:03.330
"Or, maybe you just don't know.",00:22:03.330,00:22:05.120
The game was played.,00:22:05.120,00:22:06.024
You know you won the series.,00:22:06.024,00:22:07.190
"But you don't know who
won the first game.",00:22:07.190,00:22:09.300
"And so you could think of a
probability still being there.",00:22:09.300,00:22:12.540
"Now when you think about it,
it gets me confused still.",00:22:12.540,00:22:17.220
"But just think about
it like the math.",00:22:17.220,00:22:19.840
It's the same formula.,00:22:19.840,00:22:21.981
OK.,00:22:21.981,00:22:22.480
"It doesn't matter which
happened first in time.",00:22:22.480,00:22:25.800
You use the same mathematics.,00:22:25.800,00:22:27.750
"In fact, they give a special
name these kinds of things.",00:22:27.750,00:22:31.310
"They're called a postieri
conditional probabilities.",00:22:31.310,00:22:34.480
"It's a fancy name for just
saying that things are out",00:22:50.410,00:22:55.060
of order in time.,00:22:55.060,00:22:57.711
All right?,00:22:57.711,00:22:58.210
"So it's a probability of B given
A where B precedes A in time.",00:22:58.210,00:23:07.920
All right?,00:23:14.100,00:23:16.150
So it's the same math.,00:23:16.150,00:23:17.760
It's just they're out of order.,00:23:17.760,00:23:21.500
"So let's figure
out the probability",00:23:21.500,00:23:24.910
"that you won the first game
given that you want the series.",00:23:24.910,00:23:30.090
Let's figure it out.,00:23:30.090,00:23:32.570
"So I want probability of B
given A now for this example.",00:23:32.570,00:23:38.330
"Well, it's just the
probability of B and A",00:23:38.330,00:23:42.620
over the probability of A.,00:23:42.620,00:23:47.590
"We already computed the
probability of A and B.",00:23:47.590,00:23:49.930
That's 1/3 plus 1/18.,00:23:49.930,00:23:50.950
"what's the probability
of A, the probability",00:23:56.380,00:23:58.760
of winning the first game?,00:23:58.760,00:24:00.290
1/2.,00:24:04.705,00:24:05.205
"It's those three sample points
and they better add up to 1/2",00:24:05.205,00:24:08.090
"because we sort of said, the
probability of the first game's",00:24:08.090,00:24:10.590
1/2.,00:24:10.590,00:24:12.350
"So that's over
1/2, which is 9/18.",00:24:12.350,00:24:14.900
Well this was 7/18 over 9/18.,00:24:17.780,00:24:20.200
It's 7/9.,00:24:20.200,00:24:22.980
"So the probability of
winning the first game given",00:24:22.980,00:24:25.560
that you won series is 7/9.,00:24:25.560,00:24:27.076
"Anybody notice anything
unusual about that answer here?",00:24:29.950,00:24:34.218
"It's the same as the
answer over there.",00:24:34.218,00:24:37.630
Is that a theorem?,00:24:37.630,00:24:38.380
No.,00:24:40.970,00:24:41.470
"The probability of A
given B is not always",00:24:41.470,00:24:43.920
"the probability of B given
A. It was in this case.",00:24:43.920,00:24:47.230
It is not always true.,00:24:47.230,00:24:49.070
"In fact, we could
make a simple example",00:24:49.070,00:24:52.310
"to see why that's
not always the case.",00:24:52.310,00:24:53.935
All right.,00:25:07.191,00:25:07.690
So say here's your sample space.,00:25:07.690,00:25:11.150

is B and this is",00:25:11.150,00:25:15.850
"A. What's the probability
of A given B in this case?",00:25:15.850,00:25:20.990
1.,00:25:23.670,00:25:24.330
If you're in B-- wait.,00:25:24.330,00:25:25.980
No.,00:25:25.980,00:25:26.480
It's not 1.,00:25:26.480,00:25:28.850
"What's the probability of
A given B If I got some--",00:25:28.850,00:25:32.820
probably less than 1.,00:25:32.820,00:25:33.970
"Might be I've drawn it as
1/3 third if it was uniform.",00:25:33.970,00:25:37.210
"But in this case, the
probability of A given B",00:25:37.210,00:25:40.730
is less than 1.,00:25:40.730,00:25:41.580
"What's the probability
of B given A?",00:25:41.580,00:25:43.450
"1, because if I'm in A I'm
definitely in B. All right.",00:25:47.240,00:25:53.815
"So that's an example where
they would be different.",00:25:53.815,00:25:55.940
"And that's the generic
case is they're different.",00:25:55.940,00:25:59.450
All right?,00:25:59.450,00:26:01.840
"When are they equal because
they were equal in this case?",00:26:01.840,00:26:04.360
What makes them equal?,00:26:04.360,00:26:06.640
Let's see.,00:26:06.640,00:26:07.330
"When does the
probability of A given B",00:26:07.330,00:26:11.900
"equal a probability
of B given A?",00:26:11.900,00:26:14.170
Let's see.,00:26:14.170,00:26:16.135
"Well, If I plug-in
the formula, this",00:26:16.135,00:26:19.150
"equals the probability of A and
B over the probability of B.",00:26:19.150,00:26:26.410
"That equals the probability of
B and A over a probability of A.",00:26:26.410,00:26:35.000
So when are those equal?,00:26:35.000,00:26:36.030
Yeah.,00:26:39.430,00:26:39.930
"When probability A equals
probability B. All right.",00:26:39.930,00:26:43.380
So that's one case.,00:26:43.380,00:26:45.070
What's the other case?,00:26:48.152,00:26:49.310
Yeah-- when it's 0.,00:26:54.230,00:26:55.520
"Probability-- there's
no intersection.",00:26:55.520,00:26:57.460
"Probability of A
intersect B is 0.",00:26:57.460,00:26:59.724
That's the other case.,00:26:59.724,00:27:00.640
All right.,00:27:07.071,00:27:07.570
"But usually these
conditions won't",00:27:07.570,00:27:10.030
"apply-- just happened to in
this example by coincidence.",00:27:10.030,00:27:13.690
Any questions about that?,00:27:16.320,00:27:21.750
All right.,00:27:21.750,00:27:23.650
Yeah.,00:27:23.650,00:27:24.150
"So the math is the same with
a postieri probabilities.",00:27:24.150,00:27:26.399
"It's really, really easy.",00:27:26.399,00:27:29.210
All right.,00:27:29.210,00:27:29.830
"So let's do another simple
example that'll start to maybe",00:27:29.830,00:27:33.515
be a little more confusing.,00:27:33.515,00:27:34.640
Say we've got two coins.,00:27:38.470,00:27:40.590
One of them is a fair coin.,00:27:53.510,00:27:55.080
"And by that, I mean the
probability comes up",00:27:59.200,00:28:01.530
"heads is the same as
the probability comes up",00:28:01.530,00:28:04.560
tails is 1/2.,00:28:04.560,00:28:06.980
The other one is an unfair coin.,00:28:06.980,00:28:08.770
"And in this case, that
means it's always heads.",00:28:12.440,00:28:16.056
The probability of heads is 1.,00:28:16.056,00:28:17.930
The probability of tails is 0.,00:28:17.930,00:28:21.392
All right?,00:28:21.392,00:28:22.540
I've got two such coins here.,00:28:22.540,00:28:25.370
All right.,00:28:25.370,00:28:26.330
"Here is the unfair
coin-- heads and heads.",00:28:26.330,00:28:30.870
"Actually, they make these things
look like quarters sometimes.",00:28:30.870,00:28:33.480
"Here's the fair coin--
heads and tails.",00:28:33.480,00:28:38.200
All right.,00:28:38.200,00:28:38.900
"Now suppose I pick one of
these at random, 50-50,",00:28:38.900,00:28:45.410
"I pick one of
these things, and I",00:28:45.410,00:28:50.590
"flip it, which I'm doing behind
my back, and lo and behold,",00:28:50.590,00:28:57.459
"it comes out and,
you see a heads.",00:28:57.459,00:28:58.875
"What's the probability
I'm holding the fair coin?",00:29:02.240,00:29:06.790
"I picked the coin,
50-50, behind my back.",00:29:11.010,00:29:15.700
"So one answer is, I picked the
fair coin with 50% probability.",00:29:15.700,00:29:21.420
"But then I flipped
it behind my back",00:29:21.420,00:29:24.210
"and I showed you the
result. And you see heads.",00:29:24.210,00:29:28.120
"Of course, if I'd
have shown you tails,",00:29:28.120,00:29:31.250
"You would have known for
sure it was the fair coin",00:29:31.250,00:29:33.850
"because that's the only
one with the tails.",00:29:33.850,00:29:34.960
But you don't know for sure now.,00:29:34.960,00:29:36.400
You see a heads.,00:29:36.400,00:29:38.400
"What's the probability this is
the fair coin given that you",00:29:38.400,00:29:41.280
saw a heads after the flip?,00:29:41.280,00:29:45.470
How many people think 1/2?,00:29:45.470,00:29:48.370
"After all, I picked it
with probability 1/2.",00:29:48.370,00:29:50.940
"How many people think
it's less than 1/2?",00:29:50.940,00:29:54.890
Good.,00:29:54.890,00:29:55.680
OK.,00:29:55.680,00:29:57.530
Somebody even said 1/3.,00:29:57.530,00:30:00.110
Does that sound right?,00:30:00.110,00:30:02.530
A couple people like 1/3.,00:30:02.530,00:30:04.870
OK.,00:30:04.870,00:30:07.160
All right.,00:30:07.160,00:30:07.660
"Now, part of what
makes this tricky",00:30:07.660,00:30:09.990
"is I told you I picked the
coin with 50% probability.",00:30:09.990,00:30:13.950
But then I gave you information.,00:30:13.950,00:30:15.730
So I've conditioned the problem.,00:30:15.730,00:30:19.594
"And so this is one
of those things",00:30:19.594,00:30:21.010
"you could have an
ask Marilyn about.",00:30:21.010,00:30:23.130
Is it 1/2 or is it 1/3?,00:30:23.130,00:30:24.350
"Because I picked
it with 50% chance,",00:30:24.350,00:30:26.530
"what does the
information do for you?",00:30:26.530,00:30:30.900
"Now, I'll give you a clue.",00:30:30.900,00:30:34.190
"Bobo might have written
in and said it's 1/2.",00:30:34.190,00:30:37.660
"And his proof is that
three other mathematicians",00:30:37.660,00:30:39.784
agreed with him.,00:30:39.784,00:30:40.450
[LAUGHTER],00:30:40.450,00:30:41.640
All right?,00:30:41.640,00:30:43.690
OK.,00:30:43.690,00:30:44.550
So let's figure it out.,00:30:44.550,00:30:48.030
And really it's very simple.,00:30:48.030,00:30:50.320
"It's just drawing out
the tree and computing",00:30:50.320,00:30:54.550
the conditional probability.,00:30:54.550,00:30:56.480
"So we're going to do the same
thing over and over again",00:30:56.480,00:31:00.070
"because it just works
for every problem.",00:31:00.070,00:31:03.464
"Of course, you could imagine
debating this for awhile,",00:31:03.464,00:31:07.950
arguing with somebody.,00:31:07.950,00:31:08.890
Is it 1/2 or 1/3?,00:31:08.890,00:31:10.200
Much simpler just to do it.,00:31:10.200,00:31:14.439
"So the first thing is we
have, which coin is picked?",00:31:14.439,00:31:16.605
"So it could be
fair-- and I told you",00:31:19.300,00:31:22.040
"that happens with
probability 1/2-- or unfair,",00:31:22.040,00:31:26.650
which is also 1/2.,00:31:26.650,00:31:29.300
Then we have the flip.,00:31:29.300,00:31:33.290
"The fair coin is
equally likely to be",00:31:33.290,00:31:35.570
"heads or tails, each with 1/2.",00:31:35.570,00:31:39.170
"The unfair coin, guaranteed
to be heads, probability 1.",00:31:39.170,00:31:46.190
All right.,00:31:46.190,00:31:46.730
"Now we get the sample
point outcomes.",00:31:46.730,00:31:50.510
"It's fair in heads with
the probability 1/4,",00:31:50.510,00:31:54.310
"fair in tails,
probability 1/4, unfair",00:31:54.310,00:31:57.990
"in heads, probability 1/2.",00:31:57.990,00:32:01.580
"Now we define the
events of interest.",00:32:01.580,00:32:05.070
"A is going to be that
we chose the fair coin.",00:32:05.070,00:32:07.510
"And B is at the
result, is heads.",00:32:13.670,00:32:16.450
"And of course what
I want to know",00:32:19.980,00:32:22.150
"is the probability that I
chose the fair coin given",00:32:22.150,00:32:25.640
that I saw a heads.,00:32:25.640,00:32:26.660
"So to do that we
plug in our formula.",00:32:29.610,00:32:32.020
"That's just the
probability of A and B",00:32:32.020,00:32:37.750
"over the probability
of B. And to compute",00:32:37.750,00:32:42.190
"that I got to figure out
the probability of A and B",00:32:42.190,00:32:45.890
and the probability of B.,00:32:45.890,00:32:47.240
So I'll make my diagram.,00:32:47.240,00:32:49.110
"A here, B here, A
and B. A is the event",00:32:49.110,00:32:54.970
I chose the fair coin.,00:32:54.970,00:32:57.570
That's these guys.,00:32:57.570,00:33:00.050
"B is the event the
result is heads.",00:33:00.050,00:33:02.850
That's this one and this one.,00:33:02.850,00:33:05.490
"And A intersect B,
That's the only point.",00:33:08.070,00:33:12.730
"So this is really
easy to compute now.",00:33:12.730,00:33:16.450
"What's the probability
of A and B?",00:33:16.450,00:33:18.050
1/4.,00:33:20.770,00:33:21.490
It's just that sample point.,00:33:21.490,00:33:24.270
What's the probability of B?,00:33:24.270,00:33:25.865
"3/4, 1/4 plus 1/2.",00:33:28.400,00:33:30.480
"So the probability
of A given B is 1/3.",00:33:33.100,00:33:35.630
"Really simple to
answer this question.",00:33:38.650,00:33:41.400
Just don't even think about it.,00:33:41.400,00:33:43.300
"Just write down the tree
when you get these things.",00:33:43.300,00:33:46.460
"So much easier just to
write the tree down.",00:33:46.460,00:33:50.752
All right.,00:33:50.752,00:33:51.720
"Now the key here is we
knew the probability",00:33:51.720,00:33:57.690
"of picking the fair
coin in the first place.",00:33:57.690,00:34:01.445
"Maybe it's worth
writing down what",00:34:01.445,00:34:03.090
"happens if that's a variable--
sum variable P. Let's do that.",00:34:03.090,00:34:07.268
"For example, what if I hadn't
told you the probability",00:34:15.239,00:34:20.130
that I picked the fair coin?,00:34:20.130,00:34:22.690
"I just picked one
and flipped it.",00:34:22.690,00:34:26.420
Think that'll change the answer?,00:34:26.420,00:34:30.130
"It should because you got
to plug something in there",00:34:30.130,00:34:32.940
for the 1/2 for this to work.,00:34:32.940,00:34:34.927
So let's see what happens.,00:34:34.927,00:34:36.010
"Say I picked the fair
coin with probability",00:34:36.010,00:34:40.889
"P and the unfair
coin with 1 minus P.",00:34:40.889,00:34:46.880
"And this is the same
heads and tails, 1/2, 1/2.",00:34:46.880,00:34:52.429
"Heads, the probability 1.",00:34:52.429,00:34:56.239
"Well now, instead of 1/4
I get P over 2 up here.",00:34:56.239,00:35:01.520
"And this is now 1
minus P instead of 1/2.",00:35:01.520,00:35:03.960
"So the probability of A given
B is the probability of A and B",00:35:06.580,00:35:12.736
is p over 2.,00:35:12.736,00:35:16.220
"And the probability
of B is P over 2",00:35:16.220,00:35:19.890
"plus 1 minus P. That's P over
2 up top, one minus P over 2,",00:35:19.890,00:35:31.100
"and that is all
multiplied by-- what am I",00:35:31.100,00:35:33.950
going to multiply-- 2 here.,00:35:33.950,00:35:35.720
I'll get P over 2 minus P.,00:35:35.720,00:35:41.210
"So the probability with which
I picked the coin to start with",00:35:41.210,00:35:44.810
impacts the answer here.,00:35:44.810,00:35:48.060
"For example, what if I picked
the unfair coin for sure?",00:35:48.060,00:35:55.680
That would be P being 0.,00:35:55.680,00:35:57.330
"Well, the probability that
I picked the fair coin",00:36:00.820,00:36:03.130
"is 0 over 2, which is 0.",00:36:03.130,00:36:06.704
"All right though-- even
know I showed you the heads,",00:36:06.704,00:36:08.870
"there's no chance it was the
fair coin because I picked",00:36:08.870,00:36:12.260
the unfair coin for sure.,00:36:12.260,00:36:13.610
"Same thing if I picked
the fair coin for sure,",00:36:19.840,00:36:23.020
better be the case this is 1.,00:36:23.020,00:36:25.110
So I get 1 over 2 minus 1.,00:36:25.110,00:36:26.720
It's 1.,00:36:26.720,00:36:27.400
Any questions?,00:36:30.380,00:36:32.610
"So it's important you know
the probability I picked",00:36:32.610,00:36:36.044
the fair coin to start with.,00:36:36.044,00:36:37.210
"Otherwise, you
can't go anywhere.",00:36:37.210,00:36:39.630
All right.,00:36:42.700,00:36:43.930
What if I do the same game?,00:36:43.930,00:36:46.640
Pick a coin with probability p.,00:36:46.640,00:36:50.910
But now I flip it K times.,00:36:50.910,00:36:54.291
Say I flip it 100 times.,00:36:54.291,00:36:56.400
"And every time it
comes up heads.",00:36:56.400,00:36:58.340
"I mean you're pretty sure you
got the unfair coin because you",00:37:01.420,00:37:04.720
never saw a tails.,00:37:04.720,00:37:05.850
Right?,00:37:05.850,00:37:07.480
So let's do that.,00:37:07.480,00:37:08.220
Let's compute that scenario.,00:37:08.220,00:37:11.060
"So instead of a single
heads I get K straight heads",00:37:11.060,00:37:16.430
and no tails.,00:37:16.430,00:37:19.310
"This would happen with
1 over 2 to the K.",00:37:19.310,00:37:22.290
"This would happen with 1
minus 1 over 2 to the K.",00:37:22.290,00:37:27.270
"So this is now p over 2 to
the K. This is now P1 minus 2",00:37:27.270,00:37:31.980
to the minus K.,00:37:31.980,00:37:34.870
"Let's recompute
the probabilities.",00:37:34.870,00:37:36.380
I'm going somewhere where this.,00:37:36.380,00:37:38.657
Wait a minute.,00:37:38.657,00:37:39.240
"So now we're
looking at the event",00:37:50.340,00:37:51.800
that B is K straight heads.,00:37:51.800,00:37:56.255
Come up.,00:37:59.080,00:38:02.150
"And I want to know
the probability",00:38:02.150,00:38:04.240
"that I picked the fair coin
given that it just never comes",00:38:04.240,00:38:07.420
up tails.,00:38:07.420,00:38:09.700
The math is the same.,00:38:09.700,00:38:10.575
"The probability now that
I picked the fair coin",00:38:17.390,00:38:19.895
"and got k straight
heads is just p times 2",00:38:19.895,00:38:23.310
"to the minus K. The probability
that I got K straight heads is",00:38:23.310,00:38:31.490
"P times 2 to the minus
K plus the chance",00:38:31.490,00:38:34.210
"I picked the unfair
coin, which is 1 minus P.",00:38:34.210,00:38:38.230
"And if I multiply top
and bottom by 2 to the K,",00:38:38.230,00:38:40.340
"I get P over P plus
to the K 1 minus B.",00:38:40.340,00:38:47.571
All right.,00:38:47.571,00:38:48.070
"So it gets very unlikely that
I've got the fair coin here",00:38:48.070,00:38:53.290
as K gets big.,00:38:53.290,00:38:55.280
"Like if K is 100 I got
a big number down here.",00:38:55.280,00:38:58.660
"And basically it's
0 chance-- close",00:38:58.660,00:39:00.680
to 0 chance of the fair coin.,00:39:00.680,00:39:03.900
"But now say I do the
following experiment.",00:39:06.910,00:39:10.760
"I don't tell you P.
But I pull a coin out",00:39:10.760,00:39:16.820
"and 100 flips in
a row it's heads.",00:39:16.820,00:39:21.380
Which coin do you think I have?,00:39:21.380,00:39:22.710
"I flipped it 100 straight times
and it's heads every time.",00:39:26.340,00:39:29.300
Yeah.,00:39:32.550,00:39:33.050
There's not enough information.,00:39:33.050,00:39:34.341
You don't know.,00:39:34.341,00:39:34.990
What do you want to say?,00:39:34.990,00:39:37.840
"You want to say
it's the unfair coin",00:39:37.840,00:39:40.890
"but you have no idea because I
might have picked the fair coin",00:39:40.890,00:39:46.250
"with probability 1, in which
case it is the fair coin",00:39:46.250,00:39:48.790
"and it just was unlucky
that it came up heads",00:39:48.790,00:39:51.000
100 times in a row.,00:39:51.000,00:39:53.270
But it could be.,00:39:53.270,00:39:54.530
"So you could say nothing if you
don't know the probability P.",00:39:54.530,00:39:58.730
"Because sure enough, if
I plug in P being 1 here,",00:39:58.730,00:40:05.370
"that wipes out the 2 to the K
and I just get probability 1.",00:40:05.370,00:40:07.850
OK?,00:40:10.600,00:40:12.940
All right.,00:40:12.940,00:40:13.440
"Now when this comes
up in practice",00:40:13.440,00:40:18.510
is with things like polling.,00:40:18.510,00:40:20.560
"Like, we just had an election.",00:40:20.560,00:40:22.680
"And people do poles
ahead of time.",00:40:22.680,00:40:25.430
"And they sample
thousands of voters",00:40:25.430,00:40:28.850
from 1% of the population.,00:40:28.850,00:40:31.160
"And they say, OK,
that 60% of the people",00:40:31.160,00:40:33.590
are going to vote Republican.,00:40:33.590,00:40:37.240
"And they might have a margin of
error, three points, whatever",00:40:37.240,00:40:39.880
that means.,00:40:39.880,00:40:40.380
"And we'll figure
that out next week.",00:40:40.380,00:40:42.580
"What does that tell you about
the electorate as a whole--",00:40:42.580,00:40:45.920
"the population if they sample 1%
at random, 60% are Republican.",00:40:45.920,00:40:52.180
Yeah?,00:40:52.180,00:40:54.572
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
The options you have,",00:40:54.572,00:40:58.476
"is it all heads or
is it all tails?",00:40:58.476,00:41:00.428
"It should be one
option all heads",00:41:00.428,00:41:01.892
"and another option
at least one tails.",00:41:01.892,00:41:03.860
PROFESSOR: You're right.,00:41:03.860,00:41:04.910
Oops.,00:41:04.910,00:41:06.320
All right.,00:41:06.320,00:41:06.940
At least one tail for this one.,00:41:06.940,00:41:07.903
Yeah.,00:41:07.903,00:41:08.402
Good.,00:41:08.402,00:41:10.168
That is true.,00:41:10.168,00:41:11.530
OK.,00:41:11.530,00:41:13.870
"Any questions
about that example?",00:41:13.870,00:41:18.550
OK.,00:41:18.550,00:41:19.550
"Now we're back to the
election and there's",00:41:19.550,00:41:21.300
"a pole that says they sampled
1% of the population at random",00:41:21.300,00:41:26.520
"and 60% said they're
going to vote Republican.",00:41:26.520,00:41:29.540
"And the margin of error
is 3% or something.",00:41:29.540,00:41:32.570
"What does that tell you about
the population of the country?",00:41:32.570,00:41:36.510
Nothing.,00:41:36.510,00:41:37.900
That's right.,00:41:37.900,00:41:39.560
It is what it is.,00:41:39.560,00:41:42.490
"All you can conclude is
that either the population",00:41:42.490,00:41:47.200
"is close to 60% Republican
or you were unlucky",00:41:47.200,00:41:51.920
in the 1% you sample.,00:41:51.920,00:41:54.740
"That's what you can conclude
because the population really",00:41:54.740,00:41:59.120
is fixed in this case.,00:41:59.120,00:42:00.110
It is what it is.,00:42:00.110,00:42:01.060
"There's no randomness
in the population.",00:42:01.060,00:42:04.090
All right?,00:42:04.090,00:42:04.590
"So you have next
week for recitation.",00:42:04.590,00:42:07.630
"You're going to design a
pole and work through how",00:42:07.630,00:42:09.890
"to calculate the margin
of error and work",00:42:09.890,00:42:11.640
"through what that
really means in terms",00:42:11.640,00:42:14.640
of what the population is like.,00:42:14.640,00:42:17.410
"Now of course, if it comes
out 100 straight times heads,",00:42:17.410,00:42:20.530
"you've got to be really
unlucky to have the fair coin.",00:42:20.530,00:42:23.590
"And the same thing
with designing the poll",00:42:23.590,00:42:25.460
if you're way off.,00:42:25.460,00:42:28.270
Any questions about that?,00:42:28.270,00:42:32.761
OK.,00:42:32.761,00:42:33.260
"The next example comes up
all the time in practice.",00:42:33.260,00:42:37.970
And that's with medical testing.,00:42:37.970,00:42:40.946
Maybe I'll leave-- no.,00:42:40.946,00:42:43.547
I'll take that down.,00:42:43.547,00:42:44.380
We know that now.,00:42:44.380,00:42:45.634
"Now in this case--
in fact, this is",00:43:05.030,00:43:08.520
"a question we had on the
final exam a few years ago.",00:43:08.520,00:43:11.530
"And there's a good chance
this kind of question's",00:43:11.530,00:43:14.230
"going to be on the
final this year.",00:43:14.230,00:43:16.340
There's a disease out there.,00:43:16.340,00:43:18.760
And you can have a test for it.,00:43:18.760,00:43:21.390
"But like most medical
tests, they're not perfect.",00:43:21.390,00:43:24.507
"Sometimes when it says you've
got the disease you really",00:43:24.507,00:43:26.840
don't.,00:43:26.840,00:43:27.900
"And if it ways you don't
have it, you really do.",00:43:27.900,00:43:31.657
"So in this case,
we're going to assume",00:43:31.657,00:43:33.240
"that 10% of the population has
the disease, whatever it is.",00:43:33.240,00:43:45.914
"You don't get
symptoms right away.",00:43:45.914,00:43:47.330
So you have this test.,00:43:47.330,00:43:49.190
"But if you have the disease
there is a 10% chance",00:43:49.190,00:44:04.142
that the test is negative.,00:44:04.142,00:44:05.225
"And this is called
a false negative,",00:44:08.940,00:44:15.040
"because the test comes back
negative but it's wrong,",00:44:15.040,00:44:17.410
because you have the disease.,00:44:17.410,00:44:19.750
"And similarly, if you
have the disease--",00:44:19.750,00:44:22.620
"or sorry-- if you
don't have the disease,",00:44:22.620,00:44:29.240
"there's a 30% chance that
the test comes back positive.",00:44:29.240,00:44:35.170
"And it's called a false positive
because it came back positive,",00:44:35.170,00:44:41.560
but you don't have it.,00:44:41.560,00:44:43.870
So the test is pretty good.,00:44:43.870,00:44:45.800
Right?,00:44:45.800,00:44:46.500
"It's 10% false negative right,
30% false positive right.",00:44:46.500,00:44:52.390
"Now say you select a random
person and they test positive.",00:44:52.390,00:44:59.210
"What you want to know
is the probability",00:44:59.210,00:45:01.120
"they have the disease given
that it's a random person.",00:45:01.120,00:45:04.014
"So actually, this came
up in my personal life.",00:45:07.730,00:45:12.630
"Many years ago when my wife
was pregnant with Alex,",00:45:12.630,00:45:18.080
"she was exposed to somebody
with TB here at MIT.",00:45:18.080,00:45:22.840
And she took the test.,00:45:22.840,00:45:25.400
And it came back positive.,00:45:25.400,00:45:28.040
"Now the bad thing--
TB's a bad thing.",00:45:28.040,00:45:30.639
You don't want to get it.,00:45:30.639,00:45:31.680
"But the medicine for it
you take for six months.",00:45:31.680,00:45:35.990
"And she was worried
about taking medicine",00:45:35.990,00:45:37.760
"for six months when she's
pregnant because who",00:45:37.760,00:45:40.530
"knows what the TB medicine
does kind of thing",00:45:40.530,00:45:43.830
if you have a baby.,00:45:43.830,00:45:45.940
"So she asked the doc, what's
the probability I really",00:45:45.940,00:45:48.440
have the disease?,00:45:48.440,00:45:51.320
The doc doesn't know.,00:45:51.320,00:45:53.570
"The doc maybe could give
you some of these steps,",00:45:53.570,00:45:55.620
"10% false negative,
30% false positive.",00:45:55.620,00:45:58.350
But it tested positive.,00:45:58.350,00:45:59.760
"So they just normally
give you the medicine.",00:45:59.760,00:46:03.530
So say this was the story.,00:46:03.530,00:46:05.140
What would you say?,00:46:05.140,00:46:06.490
What do you think?,00:46:06.490,00:46:07.670
"How many people think that
it's a least a 70% chance",00:46:07.670,00:46:10.090
you got the disease?,00:46:10.090,00:46:12.900
"She tested positive
and it's only",00:46:12.900,00:46:14.930
got a 30% false positive rate.,00:46:14.930,00:46:16.820
Anybody?,00:46:16.820,00:46:18.701
"So you don't think
she's likely to have it.",00:46:18.701,00:46:21.260
"How many people think
it's better than 50-50",00:46:21.260,00:46:23.720
you have the disease?,00:46:23.720,00:46:26.820
A few.,00:46:26.820,00:46:27.870
"How many people
think less than 50%.",00:46:27.870,00:46:31.420
A bunch.,00:46:31.420,00:46:32.290
Yeah.,00:46:32.290,00:46:33.070
"You're right, in fact.",00:46:33.070,00:46:36.250
Let's figure out the answer.,00:46:36.250,00:46:37.440
It's easy to do.,00:46:37.440,00:46:39.550
"So A is the event the
person has the disease.",00:46:39.550,00:46:43.935
"And B is the event that
the person tests positive.",00:46:51.800,00:46:56.835
"And of course what
we want to know",00:47:01.120,00:47:03.400
"is the probability you
have the disease given",00:47:03.400,00:47:05.670
that you tested positive.,00:47:05.670,00:47:07.550
"And that's just the probability
of both events divided",00:47:07.550,00:47:11.420
"by the probability
of testing positive.",00:47:11.420,00:47:16.340
"So let's figure that
out by drawing the tree.",00:47:16.340,00:47:20.060
"So first, do you
have the disease?",00:47:38.750,00:47:40.970
And it's yes or no.,00:47:43.980,00:47:45.360
And let's see.,00:47:49.320,00:47:50.380
"The probability of
having the disease, what",00:47:50.380,00:47:53.250
is that for a random person?,00:47:53.250,00:47:56.010
10%.,00:47:56.010,00:47:56.810
that the stat.,00:47:56.810,00:47:58.380
"So it's-- actually,
we'll call it 0.1.",00:47:58.380,00:48:01.274
And 9.9 you don't have it.,00:48:01.274,00:48:03.997
And then there's the test.,00:48:03.997,00:48:05.080
"Well, you can be
positive or negative.",00:48:07.940,00:48:09.995
"Now if you have
the disease, there",00:48:14.360,00:48:19.520
"is a-- the chance you
test negative is 10%, 0.1.",00:48:19.520,00:48:26.880
"Therefore there's a 90%
chance you test positive.",00:48:26.880,00:48:31.352
"Now if, you don't
have the disease,",00:48:31.352,00:48:32.810
you could test either way.,00:48:32.810,00:48:33.893
"If you don't have the
disease there's a 30% chance",00:48:36.740,00:48:40.390
you test positive.,00:48:40.390,00:48:42.590
"30 here and 70% percent
chance you're negative.",00:48:42.590,00:48:47.760
"Now we can compute each
sample point probability.",00:48:47.760,00:48:51.620
"This one is 0.1
times 0.9 is 0.09.",00:48:51.620,00:48:56.560
0.1 times 1 is 0.01.,00:48:56.560,00:49:00.050
0.9 and 0.3 is 0.27.,00:49:00.050,00:49:03.720
0.9 and 0.7 is 0.63.,00:49:03.720,00:49:09.580
"So all sample points
are figured out.",00:49:09.580,00:49:12.350
"Now we figure out which sample
points are in which sets.",00:49:12.350,00:49:16.240
"So we have event A, event B,
and A intersect B. Let's see.",00:49:16.240,00:49:21.650
"A is the event you
have the disease.",00:49:21.650,00:49:25.300
That's these guys.,00:49:25.300,00:49:27.590
"B is the event
you test positive.",00:49:27.590,00:49:31.790
That's this one and this one.,00:49:31.790,00:49:36.840
A intersect B is just this one.,00:49:36.840,00:49:40.521
All right.,00:49:40.521,00:49:41.020
We're almost done.,00:49:41.020,00:49:43.149
"Let's just figure
out the probability",00:49:43.149,00:49:44.690
you have the disease.,00:49:44.690,00:49:47.190
"What's the probability
of A intersect B?",00:49:47.190,00:49:49.000
0.09.,00:49:52.340,00:49:53.120
It's just that one sample point.,00:49:53.120,00:49:56.740
"What's the probability
that you tested positive?",00:49:56.740,00:49:59.645
0.36.,00:50:02.170,00:50:03.230
Yeah.,00:50:03.230,00:50:03.730
"0.09 plus 0.27, which is 0.36.",00:50:03.730,00:50:13.610
So I got 0.09 over 0.36 is 1/4.,00:50:13.610,00:50:21.430
Wow.,00:50:21.430,00:50:22.790
That seems bizarre.,00:50:22.790,00:50:24.071
Right?,00:50:24.071,00:50:24.570
"You've got a test, 10%
percent false negative,",00:50:24.570,00:50:28.740
30% false positive.,00:50:28.740,00:50:30.250
"Yet, when you test positive
there's only a 25% chance",00:50:30.250,00:50:34.060
you have the disease.,00:50:34.060,00:50:36.490
"So maybe you don't
take the medicine.",00:50:36.490,00:50:38.610
"So if there's risk
both ways, probably",00:50:38.610,00:50:40.830
don't have the disease.,00:50:40.830,00:50:42.930
Yeah?,00:50:42.930,00:50:44.970
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
disease change",00:50:44.970,00:50:46.470
"because you've
already been exposed",00:50:46.470,00:50:47.970
to somebody that has it?,00:50:47.970,00:50:48.970
"PROFESSOR: That's a
great point, great point,",00:50:48.970,00:50:52.530
"because there's
additional information",00:50:52.530,00:50:54.440
"conditioning this in the
personal example I cited.",00:50:54.440,00:50:57.190
You were exposed to somebody.,00:50:57.190,00:50:59.250
"So we need to condition
on that as well, which",00:50:59.250,00:51:02.030
"raises the chance
you have the disease.",00:51:02.030,00:51:04.250
That's a great point.,00:51:04.250,00:51:06.040
Yeah.,00:51:06.040,00:51:07.950
"Just like in the-- well, we
haven't got to that example.",00:51:07.950,00:51:10.420
"Do another example with
that exact kind of thing",00:51:10.420,00:51:12.420
is very important.,00:51:12.420,00:51:14.431
All right.,00:51:14.431,00:51:14.930
"So this is sort of
paradoxical that it",00:51:14.930,00:51:17.920
"looks like a pretty good
test-- low false positive,",00:51:17.920,00:51:21.120
"full false negatives, but
likely be wrong, at least if it",00:51:21.120,00:51:25.460
tells you have the disease.,00:51:25.460,00:51:28.637
"In fact, let's figure out.",00:51:28.637,00:51:29.720
"What's the probability
that the test is correct?",00:51:29.720,00:51:31.720
"What's the probability the
test is right in general?",00:51:35.620,00:51:39.130
72%.,00:51:43.030,00:51:44.350
Let's see.,00:51:44.350,00:51:45.570
So it would be 0.09 plus 0.63.,00:51:45.570,00:51:48.731
72%.,00:51:48.731,00:51:49.231
So it's likely to be right.,00:51:56.780,00:51:59.704
"But if it tells you
you have the disease",00:51:59.704,00:52:01.370
it's likely to be wrong.,00:52:01.370,00:52:02.460
It's hard.,00:52:05.500,00:52:06.850
Why is this happening?,00:52:06.850,00:52:08.530
Why does it come out that way?,00:52:08.530,00:52:09.780
Yeah?,00:52:09.780,00:52:10.280
"AUDIENCE: Then there is
only a 1 in 64 chance",00:52:12.980,00:52:16.190
that you have the disease.,00:52:16.190,00:52:18.630
"So if it comes back
negative, then it's",00:52:18.630,00:52:20.790
"a pretty good indication
that you're OK.",00:52:20.790,00:52:22.584
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:52:22.584,00:52:23.250
"If it comes back negative than
it really is doing very well.",00:52:23.250,00:52:26.980
That's right.,00:52:26.980,00:52:27.907
"But why is it when it
comes back positive",00:52:27.907,00:52:29.615
"that you're unlikely to have
the disease if it's a good test.",00:52:29.615,00:52:32.156
Yeah.,00:52:32.156,00:52:32.886
"AUDIENCE: The
disease is so rare.",00:52:32.886,00:52:34.260
"PROFESSOR: The
disease is so rare.",00:52:34.260,00:52:35.760
Absolutely.,00:52:35.760,00:52:37.500
This number here is so small.,00:52:37.500,00:52:39.770
And that's what's doing it.,00:52:39.770,00:52:41.960
"Because if you look at how
many people have the disease",00:52:41.960,00:52:45.020
"and test positive, it's 0.09.",00:52:45.020,00:52:47.120
"So many people don't
have the disease",00:52:47.120,00:52:50.270
"that even with a small false
positive rate, this number",00:52:50.270,00:52:53.120
swamps out that number.,00:52:53.120,00:52:55.380
"In fact, imagine
nobody had the disease.",00:52:55.380,00:52:57.930
You'd have a 0 here.,00:52:57.930,00:53:00.420
All right?,00:53:00.420,00:53:01.140
"And then you would always be
wrong if you said you had it.",00:53:01.140,00:53:04.750
OK?,00:53:04.750,00:53:05.480
That's good.,00:53:05.480,00:53:08.780
OK.,00:53:08.780,00:53:09.280
"This comes up in weather
prediction, the same paradox.",00:53:09.280,00:53:11.980
"For example, say you're
trying to predict",00:53:11.980,00:53:14.050
the weather for Seattle.,00:53:14.050,00:53:15.750

like this in Boston.",00:53:15.750,00:53:18.160

it's going to rain.",00:53:18.160,00:53:22.490
"Forget all the fancy weather
forecasting stuff, the radar,",00:53:22.490,00:53:25.272
and all the rest.,00:53:25.272,00:53:25.980

almost all the time.",00:53:28.440,00:53:30.942

"And in fact, if you
try to do fancy stuff,",00:53:31.620,00:53:34.350
"you're probably going to
be wrong more of the time.",00:53:34.350,00:53:37.220

"For example, in this
case, if you just",00:53:37.800,00:53:40.130
"say the person does not have the
disease, forget the lab test.",00:53:40.130,00:53:44.510
Just come back with negative.,00:53:44.510,00:53:47.551
How often are you right?,00:53:47.551,00:53:48.550
90% of the time you're right.,00:53:51.870,00:53:54.190
"Much better than the test
you paid a lot of money for.",00:53:54.190,00:53:56.460

of a test or a prediction.",00:54:02.630,00:54:06.500

"for is better, even though

Any questions about that?,00:54:14.240,00:54:16.004
OK.,00:54:20.350,00:54:22.030
"So For the rest of
today we're going",00:54:22.030,00:54:23.530
to do three more paradoxes.,00:54:23.530,00:54:27.160
"And in each case
they're going to expose",00:54:27.160,00:54:29.990
"a flaw in our intuition
about probability.",00:54:29.990,00:54:33.220
"But the good news
is in each case it's",00:54:33.220,00:54:34.832
easy to get the right answer.,00:54:34.832,00:54:36.040
"Just stick with the math and
try not to think about it.",00:54:36.040,00:54:39.640
"Now the first example
is a game involving",00:54:39.640,00:54:44.090
"dice that's called carnival dice
that you can find in carnivals",00:54:44.090,00:54:48.240
"and you can also
find in casinos.",00:54:48.240,00:54:50.175
"It's a pretty popular
game, actually.",00:54:53.150,00:54:57.050
"So the way it works
is as follows.",00:54:57.050,00:54:59.775
"The player picks a number from
1 to 6-- we'll call it N--",00:55:07.310,00:55:21.360
and then rolls three dice.,00:55:21.360,00:55:23.650
"And let's say they're fair
and mutually independent.",00:55:23.650,00:55:26.006
"We haven't talked
about independent.",00:55:34.970,00:55:36.470
So they're fair dice.,00:55:36.470,00:55:38.460
"For now, normal
dice-- nothing fishy.",00:55:38.460,00:55:41.250
"And the player wins if and
only if the number he picked",00:55:41.250,00:55:50.780
"comes up on at least
one of the dice.",00:55:50.780,00:55:52.455
"So you either win
or you lose the game",00:55:58.100,00:55:59.830
"depending on if your lucky
number came up at least once.",00:55:59.830,00:56:03.375
"Now you've got three dice,
each of which has a 1",00:56:05.960,00:56:08.590
"in 6 chance of coming
up a winner for you.",00:56:08.590,00:56:10.740
"So how many people think
this is a fair game-- you",00:56:13.420,00:56:17.730
"got a 50-50 chance of
winning-- three dice, each 1/6",00:56:17.730,00:56:22.730
chance of winning?,00:56:22.730,00:56:24.290
"Anybody think it's
not a fair game?",00:56:24.290,00:56:27.540
A bunch of you.,00:56:27.540,00:56:28.420
"How many people think it
is a fair game-- 50-50?",00:56:28.420,00:56:31.840
A few.,00:56:31.840,00:56:32.601
All right.,00:56:32.601,00:56:33.100
"Well, let's figure it out.",00:56:33.100,00:56:36.479
"And instead of doing
the tree method, which",00:56:36.479,00:56:38.270
"we know we're
supposed to do, we're",00:56:38.270,00:56:39.728
"just going to wing it, which
is always seems easier to do.",00:56:39.728,00:56:46.284
"If you're in the Casino
you want to just wing it",00:56:51.650,00:56:54.180
"instead of taking your napkin
out and drawing a tree.",00:56:54.180,00:56:57.970
"So the claim, question mark, is
the probability you win in 1/2.",00:56:57.970,00:57:07.740
"And the proof, question
mark, is you let Ai",00:57:07.740,00:57:15.250
"be the event that the i-th die
comes up N. And i is 1 to 3",00:57:15.250,00:57:25.220
here.,00:57:25.220,00:57:26.867
"So then you say, OK.",00:57:26.867,00:57:27.700
"The probability I win is
the probability of A1--",00:57:27.700,00:57:33.300
"I could win that
way-- or A2, or A3.",00:57:33.300,00:57:38.010
"All I need is one of the
die to come up my way.",00:57:38.010,00:57:41.810
"And that is the
probability of A1",00:57:41.810,00:57:45.430
"plus the probability of A2
plus the probability of A3.",00:57:45.430,00:57:52.210
"And each die wins for
me with probability 1/6.",00:57:52.210,00:57:54.555
And that is then 1/2.,00:57:59.345,00:58:00.220
"So that's a proof that we
win with probability of 1/2.",00:58:03.460,00:58:09.706
What do you think?,00:58:09.706,00:58:13.160
Any problems with that proof?,00:58:13.160,00:58:14.387
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:58:14.387,00:58:15.262
"PROFESSOR: Well
that's a great point.",00:58:20.489,00:58:22.030
Yeah.,00:58:22.030,00:58:22.850
"So if I extended this
nice proof technique",00:58:22.850,00:58:25.950
"I couldn't have probability of
7/6 of winning with seven die.",00:58:25.950,00:58:29.110
Yeah?,00:58:29.110,00:58:30.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:58:30.250,00:58:31.125
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:58:34.874,00:58:35.540
You're very close.,00:58:35.540,00:58:36.990
"I didn't technically
assume that.",00:58:36.990,00:58:41.062
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:58:41.062,00:58:43.970
PROFESSOR: They could double up.,00:58:43.970,00:58:45.450
Yeah.,00:58:45.450,00:58:46.580
"There's no intersection
in the events.",00:58:46.580,00:58:50.040
"In fact, there is
intersection because there's",00:58:50.040,00:58:53.220
"a chance I rolled
all six-- all Ns.",00:58:53.220,00:58:56.740
Say N is 6.,00:58:56.740,00:58:57.680
"I could roll all sixes
and then each of these",00:58:57.680,00:58:59.810
would be a winner.,00:58:59.810,00:59:00.990
"But I don't get to
count them separately.",00:59:00.990,00:59:03.604
"Then I only win
once in that case.",00:59:03.604,00:59:05.020
"In other words, all of
these could turned on",00:59:05.020,00:59:07.290
at the same time.,00:59:07.290,00:59:08.060
There's an intersection here.,00:59:08.060,00:59:09.268
So this rule does not hold.,00:59:09.268,00:59:13.570
"I need the Ai to be
disjoined for this",00:59:13.570,00:59:16.290
"to be true-- the
events to be disjoined.",00:59:16.290,00:59:20.380
"And they're not
disjoined because there's",00:59:20.380,00:59:22.110
"a sample point were
two or more of the die",00:59:22.110,00:59:25.040
"could come up the same
being a winner, which",00:59:25.040,00:59:28.470
"means the same sample
point, namely all die are N,",00:59:28.470,00:59:33.560
comes up in each of these three.,00:59:33.560,00:59:34.960
So they're not disjoined.,00:59:34.960,00:59:36.530
"Now what's the principal
you used two weeks ago when",00:59:36.530,00:59:40.690
"you did cardinality of a set--
cardinality of a union of sets?",00:59:40.690,00:59:46.560
"Inclusion, exclusion.",00:59:46.560,00:59:48.480
"And the same thing
needs to be done here.",00:59:48.480,00:59:50.700
So let's do that.,00:59:55.870,00:59:57.364
"And then we'll figure out
the actual probability.",00:59:57.364,00:59:59.405
"So this is a fact based on the
inclusion, exclusion principle.",01:00:03.450,01:00:08.130
"The probability of A1,
union A2, union A3,",01:00:08.130,01:00:13.510
"is just what you think it would
be from inclusion, exclusion.",01:00:13.510,01:00:17.680
"It's a probability of
A1 plus a probability",01:00:17.680,01:00:19.610
"of A2 plus the
probability of A3 minus",01:00:19.610,01:00:26.550
the pairwise intersections.,01:00:26.550,01:00:27.720
"A1 intersect A3 minus
probability of A2 intersect A3.",01:00:33.700,01:00:39.770
And is there anything else?,01:00:42.310,01:00:45.860
"Plus, the probably of
all of them matching.",01:00:45.860,01:00:48.300
OK.,01:00:54.860,01:00:55.360
"So the proof is
really the same proof",01:00:55.360,01:00:59.070
"you use for inclusion,
exclusion with sets.",01:00:59.070,01:01:01.676
"The only difference is that
in a probability space,",01:01:01.676,01:01:03.800
we have weights on the elements.,01:01:03.800,01:01:05.710
"And the weight corresponds
to the probability.",01:01:05.710,01:01:09.190
"So in fact, if you were drawing
the sample space, say here's A1",01:01:09.190,01:01:14.510
"and here's A2, and here's A3.",01:01:14.510,01:01:19.790
"Well, you need to add the
probabilities here, here,",01:01:19.790,01:01:24.860
and here.,01:01:24.860,01:01:25.770
"Then you subtract off the double
counting from here, from here,",01:01:25.770,01:01:30.180
and from here.,01:01:30.180,01:01:30.790
"And then you add back again
what you subtracted off",01:01:30.790,01:01:33.560
too much there.,01:01:33.560,01:01:36.460
"Same proof, it's just your
have weights on the elements",01:01:36.460,01:01:39.430
of probabilities.,01:01:39.430,01:01:41.940
All right.,01:01:41.940,01:01:42.440
"So let's figure out
the right probability.",01:01:42.440,01:01:45.280
"That's 1/6, 1/6, 1/6.",01:01:45.280,01:01:50.550
"What's the probability
of the first two die",01:01:50.550,01:01:53.700
matching-- both of them?,01:01:53.700,01:01:54.980
1/36.,01:02:00.360,01:02:02.640
"We'll talk more about
why that is next time.",01:02:02.640,01:02:05.110
"But there's a 6 for A1 then
given that 1/6 for the second",01:02:05.110,01:02:09.600
die matching.,01:02:09.600,01:02:10.260
"So it's 1/6 times
1/6 minus the 1/36.",01:02:10.260,01:02:15.800
"1/36, the chance that all three
match is 1/216 or 6 cubed.",01:02:15.800,01:02:22.010
"So when you add all that up you
get the 0.421 and some more.",01:02:22.010,01:02:29.520
"So the chance of
winning this game",01:02:29.520,01:02:31.060
"is 41% which makes it a
worst game in the casino.",01:02:31.060,01:02:36.280
"It is hard to find a
worse game than this.",01:02:36.280,01:02:38.560

"We'll study Roulette in the
last lecture-- much better game.",01:02:39.580,01:02:42.960
"And even that's a
terrible game to play.",01:02:42.960,01:02:45.990

"There's a quick proof
that it's 50-50.",01:02:47.700,01:02:49.600
"But it's horrible odds
against the house.",01:02:49.600,01:02:54.250

example because it",01:02:54.250,01:02:57.660
"shows how a rule you had for
computing the cardinality",01:02:57.660,01:03:01.490

the probability.",01:03:01.490,01:03:05.100

That's a good example.,01:05:44.540,01:05:45.740
Let's draw that.,01:05:45.740,01:05:46.406
Let's look at that case.,01:05:52.726,01:05:53.726

sample space here.",01:05:57.640,01:06:00.540

A is everything here.",01:06:26.330,01:06:30.300

"What's the probability
of A given D?",01:06:32.970,01:06:36.255
1.,01:06:36.255,01:06:39.220
All right.,01:06:39.220,01:06:39.720
"Well, this is a
problem because I",01:06:39.720,01:06:41.277
"can't have the probability ot--
what's the probably of A given",01:06:41.277,01:06:43.860

"Well, it can't be 2.",01:06:46.890,01:06:47.790
Right?,01:06:47.790,01:06:48.950
It's 1.,01:06:48.950,01:06:50.550
They are not equal.,01:06:50.550,01:06:51.550
"So you cannot do those set
rules on the right side",01:06:54.120,01:06:58.660

All right.,01:07:04.080,01:07:04.580
So this is not true.,01:07:04.580,01:07:05.413
Now nobody would do this.,01:07:13.320,01:07:14.391
Right?,01:07:14.391,01:07:14.890
"I mean, the probability of-- not
that it's-- see this example?",01:07:14.890,01:07:18.140
"This you just would never
make this mistake again seeing",01:07:18.140,01:07:21.520

"Everybody understand
the example,",01:07:23.450,01:07:25.420

not always the case",01:07:25.420,01:07:27.170
"that probability
of A given C union",01:07:27.170,01:07:28.770

you an example where you're",01:07:33.015,01:07:35.390
going to swear it's true.,01:07:35.390,01:07:38.250
All right?,01:07:38.250,01:07:39.372
And this is a real life example.,01:07:39.372,01:07:40.705
"Many years ago now there was
a sex discrimination suit",01:07:43.660,01:07:47.270
at Berkeley.,01:07:47.270,01:07:49.320
"There was a female professor
in the math department.",01:07:49.320,01:07:52.170
And she was denied tenure.,01:07:52.170,01:07:54.500
"And she filed a lawsuit
against Berkeley",01:07:54.500,01:07:57.180
alleging sex discrimination.,01:07:57.180,01:07:59.680
"Said she wasn't tenured
because she's a woman.",01:07:59.680,01:08:02.390
"Now, unfortunately
sex discrimination",01:08:02.390,01:08:04.661
"is a problem in
math departments.",01:08:04.661,01:08:06.035
"It's historically
been a difficult area.",01:08:06.035,01:08:09.900
But it's always hard to prove.,01:08:09.900,01:08:11.340
It's a nebulous kind of thing.,01:08:11.340,01:08:12.840
"They don't say, hey,
you can't have tenure",01:08:12.840,01:08:14.590
because you're a woman.,01:08:14.590,01:08:15.810
"They'd get sued and
get killed for that.",01:08:15.810,01:08:19.550
"So she had to get some
mat to back her up.",01:08:19.550,01:08:24.020
"So what she did is she looked
into Berkeley's practices",01:08:24.020,01:08:27.569
"and she found that in
all 22 departments,",01:08:27.569,01:08:31.000
"every single department,
the percentage",01:08:31.000,01:08:34.040
"of male PhD applicants
that were accepted",01:08:34.040,01:08:38.430
"was higher than the percentage
of female PhD applicants",01:08:38.430,01:08:43.950
that were accepted.,01:08:43.950,01:08:46.069
"Now you could understand some of
the departments accepting more",01:08:46.069,01:08:49.069
male PhDs than female PhDs.,01:08:49.069,01:08:50.809
But all 22?,01:08:50.809,01:08:53.430
What are the odds of that?,01:08:53.430,01:08:54.740
"I mean, so the
immediate conclusion",01:08:54.740,01:08:56.450
"is, well, that's clearly there's
sex discrimination going on",01:08:56.450,01:09:00.220
at Berkeley.,01:09:00.220,01:09:01.500
OK?,01:09:01.500,01:09:03.399
"Well Berkeley took a look at
that and said, nothing good.",01:09:03.399,01:09:06.260
That doesn't look good for them.,01:09:06.260,01:09:08.130
"But they did their own
study of PhD applicants.",01:09:08.130,01:09:13.140
"And they said that if the
university as a whole--",01:09:13.140,01:09:16.930
"look at the University as a
whole, actually, the women,",01:09:16.930,01:09:21.040
"the females have a higher
acceptance rate for the PhD",01:09:21.040,01:09:25.029
Program than the men.,01:09:25.029,01:09:27.609
So look.,01:09:27.609,01:09:28.109
"Berkeley said, we're
accepting more women",01:09:28.109,01:09:29.840
than men percentage-wise.,01:09:29.840,01:09:32.540
"So how could we be
discriminating against women?",01:09:32.540,01:09:35.620
"And this is where the same
argument the female faculty",01:09:35.620,01:09:38.670
"member's making, But they're
saying as a university",01:09:38.670,01:09:41.010
"as a whole, when you add
up all 22 departments.",01:09:41.010,01:09:44.160
"Well, that sounds pretty good.",01:09:44.160,01:09:45.410
"How could they be
discriminating?",01:09:45.410,01:09:47.790
OK.,01:09:47.790,01:09:48.290
"So the question for you
guys, is it possible that",01:09:48.290,01:09:51.790
"both sides we're
telling the truth,",01:09:51.790,01:09:54.790
"that in every single department
the women have a lower",01:09:54.790,01:09:57.580
"acceptance rate than men, but
on the university as a whole",01:09:57.580,01:10:02.010
the women are higher percentage?,01:10:02.010,01:10:04.850
"It sounds like it's-- and just
to avoid any confusion here,",01:10:04.850,01:10:12.450
"people only apply to one
department and they're only one",01:10:12.450,01:10:17.330
sex.,01:10:17.330,01:10:18.490
"So you can't--
Carroll didn't apply.",01:10:18.490,01:10:21.916
[LAUGHTER],01:10:21.916,01:10:25.620
"How many people think that one
of the sides, actually, when",01:10:25.620,01:10:28.210
"they look at the
studies was wrong,",01:10:28.210,01:10:30.040
that they're contradictory?,01:10:30.040,01:10:33.070
Nobody?,01:10:33.070,01:10:34.270
"You've been in 6
over 2 too long.",01:10:34.270,01:10:35.852
"How many people
think it's possible",01:10:35.852,01:10:37.310
that both sides were right?,01:10:37.310,01:10:40.310
Yeah.,01:10:40.310,01:10:40.941
All right.,01:10:40.941,01:10:41.440
So let's see how this works.,01:10:41.440,01:10:44.410
"And to make it simple
I'm going to get down",01:10:50.709,01:10:52.500
"to just two departments rather
than try to do data for all 22.",01:10:52.500,01:10:56.500
"And I'm going to do not the
actual data but something",01:10:56.500,01:10:59.706
"that's represents
what's going on.",01:10:59.706,01:11:01.122
OK.,01:11:05.931,01:11:06.430
"So we're going to look
at the following events.",01:11:06.430,01:11:08.388
"A is the event that the
applicant is admitted.",01:11:12.210,01:11:19.340
"FCS is the event
that the applicant",01:11:25.930,01:11:30.960
is female and applying to CS.,01:11:30.960,01:11:37.645
"FEE is the event
that the applicant",01:11:40.420,01:11:43.770
is female and applying to EE.,01:11:43.770,01:11:46.815
"MCS is the event the
applicant is a male and CS.",01:11:49.540,01:11:59.140
"And then finally we have MEE
is the event the applicant is",01:11:59.140,01:12:06.150
male and in EE.,01:12:06.150,01:12:08.194
"So we're just going to
look at two departments",01:12:08.194,01:12:10.110
"here and try to figure
out if it can happen",01:12:10.110,01:12:13.950
"that in both departments
the women are worse off",01:12:13.950,01:12:16.760
"but if you take the
union they're better off.",01:12:16.760,01:12:19.148
"So the female professor's
argument effectively",01:12:25.840,01:12:30.070
"is, the probability of being
admitted given that you're",01:12:30.070,01:12:34.030
"a female in CS is less than the
probability of being admitted",01:12:34.030,01:12:39.730
given that you're a male at CS.,01:12:39.730,01:12:43.080
And same thing in EE.,01:12:43.080,01:12:46.820
"Probability of being admitted
in EE if you're a female",01:12:46.820,01:12:50.210
is less than if you're a male.,01:12:50.210,01:12:51.465
OK?,01:12:56.290,01:12:57.680
"Now Berkeley is saying
it's sort of the reverse.",01:12:57.680,01:13:04.220
"The probability
that you're admitted",01:13:04.220,01:13:07.740
"given that you're a female
in either department",01:13:07.740,01:13:13.260
"is bigger than the probability
of being admitted if you're",01:13:13.260,01:13:17.530
a male in either department.,01:13:17.530,01:13:19.625
OK.,01:13:24.720,01:13:25.220
"So we've now expressed
their arguments",01:13:25.220,01:13:28.180
"as conditional
probabilities Any questions?",01:13:28.180,01:13:33.310
"Can you sort of see why
this seems contradictory?",01:13:33.310,01:13:37.045
"Not plus, union.",01:13:39.610,01:13:41.800
"Because this is sort of
like-- these are just joined.",01:13:41.800,01:13:45.990
This is the sum of those.,01:13:45.990,01:13:50.220
"And this is sort of
the sum of those.",01:13:50.220,01:13:54.680
And yet the inequality changed.,01:13:54.680,01:13:58.900
All right.,01:13:58.900,01:13:59.400
"In fact, this is the logic
that we've just debunked over",01:13:59.400,01:14:03.150
there-- exactly that claim.,01:14:03.150,01:14:06.306
"In fact, these are
not equal as the sum.",01:14:06.306,01:14:09.610
So let's do an example.,01:14:13.230,01:14:14.270
"Say that-- let's
do it over here.",01:14:18.370,01:14:23.107
"I'll put the real
values in over here.",01:14:23.107,01:14:24.690
"Say that for women in
computer science, 0 out of 1",01:14:24.690,01:14:28.170
"were admitted compared to
the men, were 50 out of 100",01:14:28.170,01:14:32.040
were admitted.,01:14:32.040,01:14:34.800
"And then in EE, 70
out of 100 women",01:14:34.800,01:14:37.680
"were admitted compared to the
men, which had 1 out of 1.",01:14:37.680,01:14:43.850
All right?,01:14:43.850,01:14:44.350
"So as ratios, 70%
is less than 100%.",01:14:44.350,01:14:47.450
0% is less than 50.,01:14:47.450,01:14:49.620
"Now if I look at the two
departments is a whole,",01:14:49.620,01:14:51.620
"I get 70 over 101 is in fact
bigger than 51 over 101.",01:14:51.620,01:15:00.830
All right?,01:15:00.830,01:15:01.330
"And so as a whole
women are a lot more",01:15:01.330,01:15:02.790
"likely to be admitted even
though in each department",01:15:02.790,01:15:04.590
"they're less likely
to be admitted.",01:15:04.590,01:15:06.048
OK?,01:15:08.020,01:15:10.800
"So what went wrong with
the intuition, which",01:15:10.800,01:15:13.700
"you didn't fall victim
to, but people often",01:15:13.700,01:15:16.170
"do, that it shouldn't have
been possible given that?",01:15:16.170,01:15:21.280
"What's going on
here that make it",01:15:21.280,01:15:22.710
"so that it's not
a less than when",01:15:22.710,01:15:25.659
"you look at the union
of the departments?",01:15:25.659,01:15:27.367
Yeah?,01:15:33.440,01:15:34.066
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
they're weighted differently?",01:15:34.066,01:15:36.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,01:15:36.190,01:15:36.856
"They're weighted
very differently.",01:15:36.856,01:15:39.497
You got huge waves here.,01:15:39.497,01:15:41.530
Right?,01:15:41.530,01:15:42.030
"So if I look at the average
of the percentages here,",01:15:42.030,01:15:45.740
"well it's 35% for the women
versus 75% for the men.",01:15:45.740,01:15:50.960
"So the average of the percentage
is just what you'd think.",01:15:50.960,01:15:53.860
35 is less than 75.,01:15:53.860,01:15:56.280
"But I've got huge weightings
on these guys, which changes",01:15:56.280,01:15:59.910
the numbers quite dramatically.,01:15:59.910,01:16:03.180
"So it all depends
how you count it.",01:16:03.180,01:16:04.776
"Actually, who do you
think had a better-- Yeah.",01:16:08.432,01:16:10.390
Go ahead.,01:16:10.390,01:16:11.226
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],01:16:11.226,01:16:12.120
PROFESSOR: Who won the lawsuit?,01:16:12.120,01:16:13.411
"Actually, the woman
won the lawsuit.",01:16:13.411,01:16:15.910
"And which argument
would you buy now?",01:16:15.910,01:16:18.179
You've got two arguments.,01:16:18.179,01:16:19.220
"Which one would you
believe if either?",01:16:19.220,01:16:23.120
Which one?,01:16:23.120,01:16:24.250
"I mean, now if I look
at exactly this data",01:16:24.250,01:16:28.820
"I might side-- I might
side with Berkeley",01:16:28.820,01:16:32.160
looking at these numbers.,01:16:32.160,01:16:34.400
"Then again, when you think about
all 22 departments and the fact",01:16:34.400,01:16:38.190
"they weren't this
lopsided, not so good.",01:16:38.190,01:16:40.940
So in the end Berkeley lost.,01:16:40.940,01:16:43.407
"I'm going to see another
example in a minute",01:16:43.407,01:16:45.240
"where it's even more clear
which side to believe in.",01:16:45.240,01:16:47.406
"But it really depends
on the numbers",01:16:47.406,01:16:49.330
"as to which one you
might, if you had to vote,",01:16:49.330,01:16:51.460
which way you'd vote.,01:16:51.460,01:16:54.070
Here's another example.,01:16:54.070,01:16:56.390
"This is from a newspaper article
on which airlines are best",01:16:56.390,01:17:00.820
"to fly because they have
the best on-time rates.",01:17:00.820,01:17:05.764
"And in this case they were
comparing American Airlines",01:17:05.764,01:17:10.300
"and America West,
looking at on-time rates.",01:17:10.300,01:17:14.850
"And here's the data they
showed for the two airlines.",01:17:14.850,01:17:18.550
Here's American Airlines.,01:17:18.550,01:17:20.520
Here's America West.,01:17:20.520,01:17:23.510
"And they took five cities,
LA, Phoenix, San Diego,",01:17:23.510,01:17:31.070
"San Francisco, and Seattle.",01:17:31.070,01:17:33.105
"And then you looked
at the number on time,",01:17:36.510,01:17:41.350
"the number of flights, and then
the rate, percentage on time.",01:17:41.350,01:17:47.349
And then same thing here.,01:17:47.349,01:17:48.390
"Number on time, number
of flights, and the rate.",01:17:48.390,01:17:57.300
"So I'm just going to give
you the numbers here.",01:17:57.300,01:17:59.800
"So they had 500 out of 560 for
a rate of 89%, 220 over 230",01:17:59.800,01:18:14.100
"for 95, 210 over 230 for
92%, 500 over 600 for 83%,",01:18:14.100,01:18:31.570
and then Seattle.,01:18:31.570,01:18:32.430
They had a lot of flights.,01:18:32.430,01:18:33.580
"That's where they're-- we
have a hub of 2,200 for 86%.",01:18:33.580,01:18:40.970
"And if you added them all up,
they got 3,300 out of 3,820",01:18:40.970,01:18:48.520
for 87% on time.,01:18:48.520,01:18:54.260
"Now the data for
American West looks",01:18:54.260,01:18:56.260
something like the following.,01:18:56.260,01:18:58.150
"In LA it's 700 out
of 800 for 87%.",01:18:58.150,01:19:02.716
they're based in Phoenix.,01:19:06.170,01:19:07.470
"They got a zillion
flights there.",01:19:07.470,01:19:08.860
"4,900 out of 5,300 for 92%.",01:19:08.860,01:19:16.540
"And 400 over 450 for 89%, 320,
over 450, 71%, 200 over 260",01:19:16.540,01:19:31.860
for 77%.,01:19:31.860,01:19:34.290
And then you add all them up.,01:19:34.290,01:19:35.730
"And you've got 6,520
over 7,260 for 90%.",01:19:35.730,01:19:45.110
"So the newspaper concluded
and literally said",01:19:45.110,01:19:48.530
"that American West
is the better airline",01:19:48.530,01:19:50.510
"to fly because they're
on-time rate is much better.",01:19:50.510,01:19:53.410
It's 90% versus 87%.,01:19:53.410,01:19:55.825
What do you think?,01:19:58.880,01:20:00.420
"Which airline would you
fly looking at that data?",01:20:00.420,01:20:03.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],01:20:03.960,01:20:04.835
"PROFESSOR: I know
which one I'd fly.",01:20:10.550,01:20:13.890
"It looks like America
West is better.",01:20:13.890,01:20:16.790
"Every single city, American
Airlines is better.",01:20:16.790,01:20:20.680
92 versus 89.,01:20:23.410,01:20:25.380
"Everywhere it's
better by a bunch.",01:20:25.380,01:20:26.890
83 versus 71.,01:20:26.890,01:20:29.010
86 versus 77.,01:20:29.010,01:20:31.330
"Every single city, American
Airlines is better.",01:20:31.330,01:20:36.510
"Yet, America West
is better overall.",01:20:36.510,01:20:40.422
"And that's what
the newspaper said.",01:20:40.422,01:20:41.880
They went on this.,01:20:41.880,01:20:43.196
"But of course, no matter
where you're going",01:20:43.196,01:20:44.987
"you're better off with
American Airlines.",01:20:44.987,01:20:46.695
All right?,01:20:48.961,01:20:49.460
Now what happened here?,01:20:49.460,01:20:53.880
The waiting.,01:20:53.880,01:20:55.270
"In fact, America West
flies out of Phoenix",01:20:55.270,01:20:59.460
where the weather's great.,01:20:59.460,01:21:02.520
"So you get a higher on-time rate
when in a good-weather city.",01:21:02.520,01:21:05.740
"And they got most of
their flights there.",01:21:05.740,01:21:07.690
"American Airlines got a
lot of flights in Seattle",01:21:07.690,01:21:09.940
"where the weather sucks
and you're always delayed.",01:21:09.940,01:21:14.390
All right?,01:21:14.390,01:21:14.890
"And so they look
worse on average",01:21:14.890,01:21:16.530
"because so many of their
flights are in a bad city",01:21:16.530,01:21:19.065
"and so many of America
West are in a good city.",01:21:19.065,01:21:22.750
All right?,01:21:22.750,01:21:23.250
"So it makes America
West look better",01:21:23.250,01:21:24.950
"when in fact, in this case, it's
absolutely clear whose better.",01:21:24.950,01:21:28.420
"American Airlines is
better, every single city.",01:21:28.420,01:21:31.422
All right.,01:21:31.422,01:21:32.030
"That's why Mark
Twain said, ""There's",01:21:32.030,01:21:34.860

damned lies, and statistics.""",01:21:34.860,01:21:39.700
