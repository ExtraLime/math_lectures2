Hi.,00:00:00.080,00:00:00.880
"In this problem, we'll be going
over practice with the",00:00:00.880,00:00:03.340
"calculation of conditional
probabilities.",00:00:03.340,00:00:06.140
"We'll start with a game where
our friend Alice will be",00:00:06.140,00:00:09.580
"tossing a coin with certain
bias of having a head, and",00:00:09.580,00:00:13.500
tosses this coin twice.,00:00:13.500,00:00:15.170
"And we're interested in
knowing, what's the",00:00:15.170,00:00:16.520
"probability that both
coin tosses will",00:00:16.520,00:00:19.110
end up being a head?,00:00:19.110,00:00:20.980
"The first step we're going to
do is to convert the problem",00:00:20.980,00:00:23.500
"into a mathematical form
by defining two",00:00:23.500,00:00:25.940
events as the following.,00:00:25.940,00:00:27.490
"Event A is where the first
coin toss is a head.",00:00:27.490,00:00:31.430
"And similarly, event B will be
having the second coin toss",00:00:31.430,00:00:35.200
also being a head.,00:00:35.200,00:00:37.050
"Having these two events will
allow us to say, well, the",00:00:37.050,00:00:40.910
"event that A intersection B will
be the event that both",00:00:40.910,00:00:44.280
coin tosses are a head.,00:00:44.280,00:00:45.640
"And we'd like to know the
probability of such an event.",00:00:45.640,00:00:50.640
"In particular, the probability
of A and B will be calculated",00:00:50.640,00:00:54.310
"under two types of
information.",00:00:54.310,00:00:57.040
"In the first case, we'll be
conditioning on that we know",00:00:57.040,00:01:01.480
the first coin toss is a head.,00:01:01.480,00:01:04.879
"I'd like to know what the
probability of A and B is.",00:01:04.879,00:01:07.670
"In the second case, we know that
at least one of the two",00:01:07.670,00:01:12.160
"coin tosses is a head expressed
in the form A union",00:01:12.160,00:01:16.260
B.,00:01:16.260,00:01:17.310
"And under this conditioning,
what is the probability of A",00:01:17.310,00:01:22.560
"and B, A intersection B?",00:01:22.560,00:01:25.180
"So Alice, in this problem,
says-- well, her guess will be",00:01:25.180,00:01:28.790
"that the first quantity
is no smaller",00:01:28.790,00:01:31.980
than the second quantity.,00:01:31.980,00:01:33.630
"Namely, knowing that the first
coin toss is a head somehow",00:01:33.630,00:01:38.900
"more strongly implies that both
coin tosses will be a",00:01:38.900,00:01:41.800
"head, compared to the case that
we only know at least one",00:01:41.800,00:01:44.650
"of the two coin tosses
is a head.",00:01:44.650,00:01:46.610
And we'd like to verify if this,00:01:46.610,00:01:49.190
inequality is indeed true.,00:01:49.190,00:01:51.440
"To do so, let's just use the
basic calculation of",00:01:51.440,00:01:54.970
conditional probability.,00:01:54.970,00:01:56.780
"Now, from the lectures, you've
already learned that to",00:01:56.780,00:01:59.110
"calculate this quantity, we'll
write out a fraction where the",00:01:59.110,00:02:02.880
"numerator is the probability of
the intersection of these",00:02:02.880,00:02:07.240
two events.,00:02:07.240,00:02:08.550
"So we have A intersect B
intersection A divided by the",00:02:08.550,00:02:16.820
"probability of the event that
we're conditioning on, which",00:02:16.820,00:02:19.410
is A.,00:02:19.410,00:02:23.000
"Now, the top quantity, since
we know that A and B is a",00:02:23.000,00:02:28.140
"subset of event A, then taking
the intersection of these two",00:02:28.140,00:02:32.110
"quantities will just give
us the first event.",00:02:32.110,00:02:35.190
"So we have A and B. And the
bottom is still probability of",00:02:35.190,00:02:41.060
A.,00:02:41.060,00:02:42.560
"Let's do the same thing for
the second quantity here.",00:02:42.560,00:02:45.780
"We have the top probability of A
and B intersection the event",00:02:45.780,00:02:54.480
"A union B, and on the bottom,
probability of the event A and",00:02:54.480,00:03:02.430
"B. Again, we see the event A and
B is a subset of the event",00:03:02.430,00:03:08.930
"A union B. So the top will be
A and B. And the bottom--",00:03:08.930,00:03:16.050
A union B.,00:03:16.050,00:03:19.990
"OK, now let's stop
for a little bit.",00:03:19.990,00:03:23.070
"We've computed the probability
for each expression in the",00:03:23.070,00:03:28.230
following fractional form.,00:03:28.230,00:03:30.280
"And we observed that for
both fractions, the",00:03:30.280,00:03:32.610
numerator is the same.,00:03:32.610,00:03:33.920
"So the numerator is a
probability of A and B. And",00:03:33.920,00:03:37.530
"the denominator in the first
case is probably of A, and the",00:03:37.530,00:03:41.590
"second case, probably
of A union B.",00:03:41.590,00:03:44.490
"Since we know that A is a subset
of the event A union B,",00:03:44.490,00:03:49.370
"and by the monotonicity of
probabilities, we know that",00:03:49.370,00:03:53.120
"the probability of A is hence no
greater than a probability",00:03:53.120,00:03:57.230
"of A union B. Substituting
this back into these",00:03:57.230,00:04:02.080
"expressions, we know that
because they lie in the",00:04:02.080,00:04:07.330
"denominators, the first
expression is indeed no",00:04:07.330,00:04:11.500
"smaller than the second
expression.",00:04:11.500,00:04:13.430
"So our friend Alice
was correct.",00:04:13.430,00:04:16.690
"So throughout this problem, we
never used the fact that the",00:04:16.690,00:04:20.269
"probability of a particular coin
toss results, let's say,",00:04:20.269,00:04:25.160
in a head is a certain number.,00:04:25.160,00:04:27.270
"Actually, this bias for the
coin is irrelevant.",00:04:27.270,00:04:30.430
"Whether the coin is fair
or unfair, this",00:04:30.430,00:04:33.260
fact is always true.,00:04:33.260,00:04:35.170
"So indeed, it does
not depend on the",00:04:35.170,00:04:36.750
probability of the coin.,00:04:36.750,00:04:38.660
"But if you're really curious
what happens when the coin is",00:04:38.660,00:04:43.440
"fair, we can plug
in the numbers.",00:04:43.440,00:04:45.820
"And here, we're assuming the
coin is fair, which means",00:04:45.820,00:04:52.320
"probability of having
a head is 1/2.",00:04:52.320,00:04:57.790
"Then, we'll see after going
through the calculations that",00:04:57.790,00:05:01.130
"the first probability is 1/2,
whereas the second probability",00:05:01.130,00:05:05.610
"is 1/3, which means, in this
case, the [? dominance ?]",00:05:05.610,00:05:11.660
actually is strict.,00:05:11.660,00:05:12.640
"So the first one is strictly
greater than",00:05:12.640,00:05:14.550
"the second one, OK?",00:05:14.550,00:05:16.110
"So this completes the first
part of the problem.",00:05:16.110,00:05:18.480
"How do we generalize this into
more general settings?",00:05:18.480,00:05:22.590
"There are multiple ways,
but we'll go over",00:05:22.590,00:05:24.300
one particular form.,00:05:24.300,00:05:27.630
"And to do so, we'll be defining
three events somewhat",00:05:27.630,00:05:35.880
more abstractly.,00:05:35.880,00:05:37.030
"Let's say we have
three events--",00:05:37.030,00:05:38.420
"C, D, and E. Imagine any event,
but all three events",00:05:38.420,00:05:44.530
"have to satisfy the following
condition.",00:05:44.530,00:05:47.000
"First, event D will be a subset
of E. And second, the",00:05:47.000,00:05:54.620
"intersection of C and
D is equal to the",00:05:54.620,00:05:57.950
"intersection of C and E, OK?",00:05:57.950,00:06:01.340
"So this will be our
choice events.",00:06:01.340,00:06:03.570
"And let's see a particular
example.",00:06:03.570,00:06:07.700
"Let's say you have a sample
space here and some event E.",00:06:07.700,00:06:12.990
"Now, by the first condition, D
will have to lie somewhere in",00:06:12.990,00:06:17.570
"E. For the second condition,
we'll pick some event C such",00:06:17.570,00:06:21.990
that this is true.,00:06:21.990,00:06:23.500
"And one way to do so is simply
picking C that lies within",00:06:23.500,00:06:27.780
"both D and E. And you can see
C intersection D will be C.",00:06:27.780,00:06:32.630
"And C intersection E will still
be C. Hence, the second",00:06:32.630,00:06:37.910
equality is true.,00:06:37.910,00:06:39.760
"So if both equalities are true,
we have the following",00:06:39.760,00:06:42.720
"relationship, that the
probability of C conditional",00:06:42.720,00:06:46.170
"on D will be no smaller than
the probability of C",00:06:46.170,00:06:51.940
"conditional on event E. And this
will be the more general",00:06:51.940,00:06:57.150
"form of the inequality
that we saw before.",00:06:57.150,00:06:59.265
 ,00:06:59.265,00:07:01.940
"So first of all, the
way to prove this",00:07:01.940,00:07:03.430
is in fact the same.,00:07:03.430,00:07:04.590
"We simply write out the
value of this using",00:07:04.590,00:07:07.920
the fractional form.,00:07:07.920,00:07:09.410
"And based on these two facts,
we can arrive at this",00:07:09.410,00:07:12.180
"equation, which I shall
now go over.",00:07:12.180,00:07:15.000
"But just to see why this form
is more general, in fact, if",00:07:15.000,00:07:18.380
"we-- say we let C be the event
A intersection B, D be the",00:07:18.380,00:07:25.950
"event A, and E be the event A
and B where A and B are the",00:07:25.950,00:07:36.070
"events that we defined
earlier.",00:07:36.070,00:07:37.990
"We can verify that, indeed,
these conditions are true,",00:07:37.990,00:07:41.260
"namely D is a subset of E.
Because A is a subset of A",00:07:41.260,00:07:45.170
"union B, and C is a subset of
both D and E. And hence,",00:07:45.170,00:07:50.870
condition two is also true.,00:07:50.870,00:07:53.030
"And if that's the case, we
will actually recover the",00:07:53.030,00:07:56.330
"result we got earlier for events
A and B. And hence,",00:07:56.330,00:08:00.440
"this equation here is
a more general form.",00:08:00.440,00:08:03.710
"So that's the end
of the problem.",00:08:03.710,00:08:04.870
See you next time.,00:08:04.870,00:08:06.120
 ,00:08:06.120,00:08:09.834
