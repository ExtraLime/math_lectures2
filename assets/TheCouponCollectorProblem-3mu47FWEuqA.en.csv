"In this exercise, we'll be
looking at a problem, also",00:00:00.530,00:00:03.340
"know as the coupons collector's
problem.",00:00:03.340,00:00:05.710
"We have a set of K coupons,
or grades in our case.",00:00:05.710,00:00:09.500
"And each time slot
we're revealed",00:00:09.500,00:00:11.230
with one random grade.,00:00:11.230,00:00:13.210
"And we'd like to know how long
it would take for us to",00:00:13.210,00:00:15.230
collect all K grades.,00:00:15.230,00:00:16.900
"In our case, K is equal to 6.",00:00:16.900,00:00:20.690
"Now the key to solving
the problem",00:00:20.690,00:00:22.390
is essentially twofolds.,00:00:22.390,00:00:23.930
"First, we'll have to find a way
to intelligently define",00:00:23.930,00:00:26.980
"sequence random variables that
captured, essentially,",00:00:26.980,00:00:30.050
stopping time of this process.,00:00:30.050,00:00:32.280
"And then we'll employ the idea
of linearity of expectations",00:00:32.280,00:00:35.930
"in breaking down this value
in simpler terms.",00:00:35.930,00:00:39.740
So let's get started.,00:00:39.740,00:00:41.260
"We'll define Yi as the number
of papers till we see",00:00:41.260,00:00:49.440
the i-th new grade.,00:00:49.440,00:00:50.910
 ,00:00:50.910,00:00:56.420
What does that mean?,00:00:56.420,00:00:57.280
"Well, let's take a look
at an example.",00:00:57.280,00:01:00.040
"Suppose, here we have a timeline
from no paper yet,",00:01:00.040,00:01:04.069
"first paper, second paper,
third paper,",00:01:04.069,00:01:06.740
"so on, and so forth.",00:01:06.740,00:01:08.430
"Now, if we got grade A on the
first slot, grade A minus on",00:01:08.430,00:01:12.230
"second slot, A again on the
third slot, let's say there's",00:01:12.230,00:01:16.020
"a fourth's slot, we got B.",00:01:16.020,00:01:17.960
"According to this process, we
see that Y1 is always 1,",00:01:17.960,00:01:22.380
"because whatever we got
on the first slot",00:01:22.380,00:01:24.100
will be a new grade.,00:01:24.100,00:01:25.810
"Now, Y2 is 2, because
the second paper is,",00:01:25.810,00:01:29.000
"again, a new grade.",00:01:29.000,00:01:31.190
"On the third paper we got a
grade, which is the same as",00:01:31.190,00:01:33.690
the first grade.,00:01:33.690,00:01:34.950
"So that would not
count as any Yi.",00:01:34.950,00:01:38.150
"And the third time we saw new
grade would now be paper four.",00:01:38.150,00:01:43.940
"According to this notation,
we're interested in knowing",00:01:43.940,00:01:47.490
"what is the expected value of E
of Y6, which is the time it",00:01:47.490,00:01:53.600
"takes to receive
all six grades.",00:01:53.600,00:01:56.270
"So so far this notation isn't
really helping us in solving",00:01:56.270,00:01:59.180
"the problem, but kind of just
staying a different way.",00:01:59.180,00:02:02.290
"It turns out, it's much easier
to look at the following",00:02:02.290,00:02:05.290
variable derived from the Yis.,00:02:05.290,00:02:07.690
"We'll define Xi as the
difference between Yi",00:02:07.690,00:02:11.090
plus 1 minus Yi.,00:02:11.090,00:02:13.700
"And in [? words, ?] it says, Xi
is a number of papers you",00:02:13.700,00:02:17.690
"need until you see the i plus
1-th new grade, after you have",00:02:17.690,00:02:21.950
received i new grade so far.,00:02:21.950,00:02:23.840
"So in this case, X1 will be if
we call 0, Y0, will be the",00:02:23.840,00:02:30.450
"difference between Y1 and
Y0, which is always 1--",00:02:30.450,00:02:34.030
that's X1.,00:02:34.030,00:02:35.270
"And the difference between
these two will be X2.",00:02:35.270,00:02:38.100
"And the difference between
Y3 and Y2--",00:02:38.100,00:02:42.100
Sorry.,00:02:42.100,00:02:44.685
"It should be Y X0,
1, 2, and so on.",00:02:44.685,00:02:51.590
OK?,00:02:51.590,00:02:53.610
"Through this notation we see
that Y6 now can be written as",00:02:53.610,00:02:59.040
"the summation of i equal
to 0, 2, 5, X, i.",00:02:59.040,00:03:04.700
"So all I did was to break down
i6 into a sequence of",00:03:04.700,00:03:08.580
"summation of the differences,
like Y. 6 Minus Y5, Y5 minus",00:03:08.580,00:03:13.220
"Y4, and so on.",00:03:13.220,00:03:14.960
"It turns out, this expression
will be very useful.",00:03:14.960,00:03:19.060
OK.,00:03:19.060,00:03:20.420
"So now that we have the two
variables Y and X, let's see",00:03:20.420,00:03:25.280
"if it will be easier to look
at the distribution of X in",00:03:25.280,00:03:28.200
studying this process.,00:03:28.200,00:03:30.170
"Let's say, we have seen
a new grade so far--",00:03:30.170,00:03:34.370
one.,00:03:34.370,00:03:35.400
"How many trials would it
take for us to see",00:03:35.400,00:03:37.660
the second new grade?,00:03:37.660,00:03:38.710
"It turns out it's
not that hard.",00:03:38.710,00:03:40.720
"In this case, we know there is
a total of six grades, and we",00:03:40.720,00:03:44.790
have seen one of them.,00:03:44.790,00:03:45.890
"So that leaves us five
more grades that",00:03:45.890,00:03:48.920
we'll potentially see.,00:03:48.920,00:03:50.290
"And therefore, on any random
trial after that, there is a",00:03:50.290,00:03:53.740
"probability of 5 over 6 that
we'll see a new grade.",00:03:53.740,00:03:57.560
"And hence, we know that X1 has
a distribution geometric with",00:03:57.560,00:04:03.970
"a success probability,
or a parameter, 5/6.",00:04:03.970,00:04:08.350
"Now, more generally, if we
extend this idea further, we",00:04:08.350,00:04:12.580
"see that Xi will have a
geometric distribution of",00:04:12.580,00:04:19.019
parameter 6 minus i over 6.,00:04:19.019,00:04:24.840
"And this is due to the fact that
so far we have already",00:04:24.840,00:04:27.120
seen i new grades.,00:04:27.120,00:04:29.630
"And that will be the success
probability of seeing a",00:04:29.630,00:04:33.350
further new grade.,00:04:33.350,00:04:35.480
"So from this expression, we know
that the expected value",00:04:35.480,00:04:39.670
"of Xi will simply be the inverse
of the parameter of",00:04:39.670,00:04:45.780
"the geometric distribution,
which is 6 over 6 minus i or 6",00:04:45.780,00:04:51.730
times 1 over 6 minus i.,00:04:51.730,00:04:54.350
 ,00:04:54.350,00:04:56.930
"And now we're ready to compute
a final answer.",00:04:56.930,00:05:00.600
"So from this expression we know
expected value of Y6 is",00:05:00.600,00:05:05.550
"equal to the expected value of
sum of i equal to 0 to 5 Xi.",00:05:05.550,00:05:13.280
 ,00:05:13.280,00:05:16.360
"And by the linearity of
expectation, we can pull out",00:05:16.360,00:05:19.600
"the sum and write it as 2,
5 expected value of Xi.",00:05:19.600,00:05:28.140
"Now, since we know that
expective of Xi is the",00:05:28.140,00:05:31.220
following expression.,00:05:31.220,00:05:32.670
"We see that this term is equal
to 6 times expected value of i",00:05:32.670,00:05:36.990
"equals 0, 5, 1 over 6 minus i.",00:05:36.990,00:05:43.260
"Or written in the other way
this is equal to 6 times i",00:05:43.260,00:05:48.260
"equal to 0, 2, 5.",00:05:48.260,00:05:51.356
"In fact, 1, 2, 5, 1 over i.",00:05:51.356,00:06:03.510
"And all I did here was to,
essentially, change the",00:06:03.510,00:06:05.970
"variable, so that these two
summations contained exactly",00:06:05.970,00:06:10.190
the same terms.,00:06:10.190,00:06:12.030
"And this will give us the
answer, which is 14.7.",00:06:12.030,00:06:20.840
"Now, more generally, we can
see that there's nothing",00:06:20.840,00:06:24.420
special about number 6 here.,00:06:24.420,00:06:26.400
"We could have substituted 6 with
a number, let's say, K.",00:06:26.400,00:06:30.640
"And then we'll get E of YK,
let's say, there's more than",00:06:30.640,00:06:37.840
six labels.,00:06:37.840,00:06:39.580
"And this will give us K times
summation i equal to 1, so K",00:06:39.580,00:06:45.030
"minus 1, 1 over i.",00:06:45.030,00:06:47.740
"Interestingly, it turns out
this quantity has an",00:06:47.740,00:06:51.000
[? asymptotic ?],00:06:51.000,00:06:51.480
"expression that, essentially,
is roughly equal to K times",00:06:51.480,00:06:56.170
"the natural logarithm of K.
And this is known as the",00:06:56.170,00:07:01.100
scaling [? la ?],00:07:01.100,00:07:02.190
"for the coupon collector's
problem that says,",00:07:02.190,00:07:04.680
"essentially, takes about
K times [? la ?]",00:07:04.680,00:07:06.810
"K many trials until we collect
all K coupons.",00:07:06.810,00:07:11.650
"And that'll be the end
of the problem.",00:07:11.650,00:07:13.800
See you next time.,00:07:13.800,00:07:15.050
 ,00:07:15.050,00:07:15.850
