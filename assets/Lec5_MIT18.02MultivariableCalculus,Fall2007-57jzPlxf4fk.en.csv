"So -- So, yesterday we learned
about the questions of planes",00:00:23.250,00:00:28.947
"and how to think of 3x3 linear
systems in terms of",00:00:28.947,00:00:33.679
"intersections of planes and how
to think about them",00:00:33.679,00:00:38.508
"geometrically.
And, that in particular led us",00:00:38.508,00:00:42.619
"to see which cases actually we
don't have a unique solution to",00:00:42.619,00:00:47.050
"the system,
but maybe we have no solutions",00:00:47.050,00:00:49.964
"or infinitely many solutions
because maybe the line at",00:00:49.964,00:00:53.186
"intersection of two of the
planes happens to be parallel to",00:00:53.186,00:00:56.713
"the other plane.
So, today, we'll start by",00:00:56.713,00:01:02.544
"looking at the equations of
lines.",00:01:02.544,00:01:08.920
"And, so in a way it seems like
something which we've already",00:01:08.920,00:01:18.471
"seen last time because we have
seen that we can think of a line",00:01:18.471,00:01:28.508
"as the intersection of two
planes.",00:01:28.508,00:01:34.660
"And, we know what equations of
planes look like.",00:01:34.660,00:01:37.989
"So, we could describe a line by
two equations telling us about",00:01:37.989,00:01:42.724
"the two planes that intersect on
the line.",00:01:42.724,00:01:46.140
"But that's not the most
convenient way to think about",00:01:46.140,00:01:48.976
"the line usually,
though, because when you have",00:01:48.976,00:01:51.485
"these two questions,
have you solve them?",00:01:51.485,00:01:53.940
"Well, OK, you can,
but it takes a bit of effort.",00:01:53.940,00:01:57.590
"So, instead,
there is another representation",00:01:57.590,00:02:03.789
"of a line.
So, if you have a line in",00:02:03.789,00:02:07.500
"space, well, you can imagine may
be that you have a point on it.",00:02:07.500,00:02:12.650
"And, that point is moving in
time.",00:02:12.650,00:02:14.810
"And, the line is the trajectory
of a point as time varies.",00:02:14.810,00:02:19.889
"So, think of a line as the
trajectory of a moving point.",00:02:19.889,00:02:33.910
"And, so when we think of the
trajectory of the moving point,",00:02:33.910,00:02:44.797
"that's called a parametric
equation.",00:02:44.797,00:02:51.810
"OK, so we are going to learn
about parametric equations of",00:02:51.810,00:03:01.087
"lines.
So, let's say for example that",00:03:01.087,00:03:07.138
"we are looking at the line.
So, to specify a line in space,",00:03:07.138,00:03:13.964
"I can do that by giving you two
points on the line or by giving",00:03:13.964,00:03:18.754
"you a point and a vector
parallel to the line.",00:03:18.754,00:03:22.539
"For example,
so let's say I give you two",00:03:22.539,00:03:28.227
"points on the line:
(-1,2,2), and the other point",00:03:28.227,00:03:35.227
"will be (1,3,-1).
So, OK, it's pretty good",00:03:35.227,00:03:40.368
"because we have two points in
that line.",00:03:40.368,00:03:43.919
"Now, how do we find all the
other points?",00:03:43.919,00:03:46.620
"Well, the other points in
between these guys and also on",00:03:46.620,00:03:50.270
"either side.
Let's imagine that we have a",00:03:50.270,00:03:54.434
"point that's moving on the line,
and at time zero,",00:03:54.434,00:04:00.095
"it's here at Q0.
And, in a unit time,",00:04:00.095,00:04:03.321
"I'm not telling you what the
unit is.",00:04:03.321,00:04:05.280
"It could be a second.
It could be an hour.",00:04:05.280,00:04:08.116
"It could be a year.
At t=1, it's going to be at Q1.",00:04:08.116,00:04:12.650
"And, it moves at a constant
speed.",00:04:12.650,00:04:14.539
"So, maybe at time one half,
it's going to be here.",00:04:14.539,00:04:17.329
"Times two, it would be over
there.",00:04:17.329,00:04:19.329
"And, in fact,
that point didn't start here.",00:04:19.329,00:04:21.480
"Maybe it's always been moving
on that line.",00:04:21.480,00:04:24.120
"At time minus two,
it was down there.",00:04:24.120,00:04:29.060
"So, let's say Q(t) is a moving
point, and at t=0 it's at Q0.",00:04:29.060,00:04:51.550
"And, let's say that it moves.
Well, we couldn't make it move",00:04:51.550,00:04:55.483
"in any way we want.
But, probably the easiest to",00:04:55.483,00:04:58.183
"find, so our role is going to
find formulas for a position of",00:04:58.183,00:05:02.135
"this moving point in terms of t.
And, we'll use that to say,",00:05:02.135,00:05:06.036
"well,
any point on the line is of",00:05:06.036,00:05:08.422
"this form where you have to plug
in the current value of t",00:05:08.422,00:05:12.587
"depending on when it's hit by
the moving point.",00:05:12.587,00:05:16.240
"So, perhaps it's easiest to do
it if we make it move at a",00:05:16.240,00:05:24.115
"constant speed on the line,
and that speed is chosen so",00:05:24.115,00:05:31.709
"that at time one,
it's at Q1.",00:05:31.709,00:05:36.350
"So, the question we want to
answer is, what is the position",00:05:45.319,00:05:56.894
"at time t, so,
the point Q(t)?",00:05:56.894,00:06:03.279
"Well, to answer that we have an
easy observation,",00:06:03.279,00:06:08.871
"which is that the vector from
Q0 to Q of t is proportional to",00:06:08.871,00:06:15.861
"the vector from Q0 to Q1.
And, what's the proportionality",00:06:15.861,00:06:23.953
"factor here?
Yeah, it's exactly t.",00:06:23.953,00:06:27.970
"At time one,
Q0 Q is exactly the same.",00:06:27.970,00:06:34.310
"Maybe I should draw another
picture again.",00:06:34.310,00:06:36.650
"I have Q0.
I have Q1, and after time t,",00:06:36.650,00:06:43.863
"I'm here at Q of t where this
vector from Q0 Q(t) is actually",00:06:43.863,00:06:56.299
"going to be t times the vector
Q0 Q1.",00:06:56.299,00:07:04.589
"So, when t increases,
it gets longer and longer.",00:07:04.589,00:07:09.930
"So, does everybody see this now?
Is that OK?",00:07:09.930,00:07:15.769
"Any questions about that?
Yes?",00:07:15.769,00:07:24.149
"OK, so I will try to avoid
using blue.",00:07:24.149,00:07:26.200
"Thanks for, that's fine.
So, OK, I will not use blue",00:07:26.200,00:07:37.295
"anymore.
OK, well, first let me just",00:07:37.295,00:07:42.655
"make everything white just for
now.",00:07:42.655,00:07:46.250
"This is the vector from Q0 to
Q(t).",00:07:46.250,00:07:49.490
"This is the point Q(t).
OK, is it kind of visible now?",00:07:49.490,00:07:56.430
"OK, thanks for pointing it out.
I will switch to brighter",00:07:56.430,00:08:03.261
"colors.
So, OK, so apart from that, ",00:08:03.261,00:08:09.389
"I claim now we can find the
position of its moving point",00:08:09.389,00:08:13.389
"because,
well, this vector,",00:08:13.389,00:08:15.663
"Q0Q1 we can find from the
coordinates of Q0 and Q1.",00:08:15.663,00:08:19.920
"So, we just subtract the
coordinates of Q0 from those of",00:08:19.920,00:08:26.535
"Q1 will get that vector Q0 Q1 is
&amp;lt;2,1, -3&amp;gt;",00:08:26.535,00:08:32.187
"OK,
so, if I look at it,",00:08:32.187,00:08:36.132
"well, so let's call x(t),
y(t), and z(t) the coordinates",00:08:36.132,00:08:44.335
"of the point that's moving on
the line.",00:08:44.335,00:08:50.600
"Then we get x of t minus,
well, actually plus one equals",00:08:50.600,00:09:00.308
"t times two.
I'm writing the components of",00:09:00.308,00:09:07.388
"Q0Q(t).
And here, I'm writing t times",00:09:07.388,00:09:13.217
"Q0Q1.
y(t) minus two equals t,",00:09:13.217,00:09:19.597
"and z(t) minus two equals -3t.
So, in other terms,",00:09:19.597,00:09:28.573
"the more familiar way that we
used to write these equations,",00:09:28.573,00:09:34.950
"let me do it that way instead, 
minus one plus 2t,",00:09:34.950,00:09:42.686
"y(t) = 2 t, z(t) = 2 - 3t.
And, if you prefer,",00:09:42.686,00:09:53.732
"I can just say Q(t) is Q0 plus
t times vector Q0Q1.",00:09:53.732,00:10:02.470
"OK, so that's our first
parametric equation of a line in",00:10:02.470,00:10:07.428
"this class.
And, I hope you see it's not",00:10:07.428,00:10:10.152
"extremely hard.
In fact, parametric equations",00:10:10.152,00:10:13.103
"of lines always look like that.
x, y, and z are functions of t",00:10:13.103,00:10:17.766
"but are of the form a constant
plus a constant times t.",00:10:17.766,00:10:22.220
"The coefficients of t tell us
about a vector along the line.",00:10:22.220,00:10:26.809
"Here, we have a vector,
Q0Q1, which is &amp;lt;2,1,-3&amp;gt;.",00:10:26.809,00:10:33.590
"And, the constant terms tell us
about where we are at t=0.",00:10:33.590,00:10:37.230
"If I plug t=0 these guys go
away, I get minus 1,2,",00:10:37.230,00:10:41.011
"2.
That's my starting point.",00:10:41.011,00:10:46.610
"OK, so, any questions about
that?",00:10:46.610,00:10:59.730
"No?
OK, so let's see,",00:10:59.730,00:11:05.125
"now, what we can do with these
parametric equations.",00:11:05.125,00:11:12.000
"So, one application is to think
about the relative position of a",00:11:12.000,00:11:26.409
"line and a plane with respect to
each other.",00:11:26.409,00:11:36.929
"So, let's say that we take
still the same line up there,",00:11:36.929,00:11:44.734
"and let's consider the plane
with the equation x 2y 4z = 7.",00:11:44.734,00:11:53.389
"OK, so I'm giving you this
plane.",00:11:53.389,00:11:55.279
"And, the questions that we are
going to ask ourselves are,",00:11:55.279,00:11:58.394
"well, does the line intersect
the plane?",00:11:58.394,00:12:00.690
"And, where does it intersect
the plane?",00:12:00.690,00:12:02.480
"So, let's start with the first
primary question that maybe we",00:12:22.340,00:12:28.202
"should try to understand.
We have these points.",00:12:28.202,00:12:32.779
"We have this plane,
and we have these points,",00:12:32.779,00:12:35.883
"Q0 and Q1.
I'm going to draw them in",00:12:35.883,00:12:38.367
"completely random places.
Well, are Q0 and Q1 on the same",00:12:38.367,00:12:42.396
"side of a plane or on different
sides, on opposite sides of the",00:12:42.396,00:12:47.049
"planes?
Could it be that maybe one of",00:12:47.049,00:12:50.028
"the points is in the plane?
So, I think I'm going to let",00:12:50.028,00:12:59.015
"you vote on that.
So, is that readable?",00:12:59.015,00:13:05.366
"Is it too small?
OK, so anyway,",00:13:05.366,00:13:08.274
"the question says,
relative to the plane,",00:13:08.274,00:13:12.060
"x 2y 4z = 7.
This point, Q0 and Q1,",00:13:12.060,00:13:16.497
"are they on the same side,
on opposite sides,",00:13:16.497,00:13:22.533
"is one of them on the plane,
or we can't decide?",00:13:22.533,00:13:29.530
"OK, that should be better.
So, I see relatively few",00:13:29.530,00:13:41.681
"answers.
OK, it looks like also a lot of",00:13:41.681,00:13:46.619
"you have forgotten the cards
and, so I see people raising two",00:13:46.619,00:13:51.515
"fingers, I see people raising
three fingers.",00:13:51.515,00:13:55.350
"And, I see people raising four
fingers.",00:13:55.350,00:13:57.539
"I don't see anyone answering
number one.",00:13:57.539,00:14:01.730
"So, the general idea seems to
be that either they are on",00:14:01.730,00:14:03.899
"opposite sides.
Maybe one of them is on the",00:14:03.899,00:14:07.071
"plane.
Well, let's try to see.",00:14:07.071,00:14:10.010
"Is one of them on the plane?
Well, let's check.",00:14:10.010,00:14:14.649
"OK, so let's look at the point,
sorry.",00:14:14.649,00:14:20.108
"I have one blackboard to use
here.",00:14:20.108,00:14:25.419
"So, I take the point Q0,
which is at (-1,2,2).",00:14:25.419,00:14:31.409
"Well, if I plug that into the
plane equation,",00:14:31.409,00:14:37.141
"so, x 2y 4z will equal minus
one plus two times two plus four",00:14:37.141,00:14:44.956
"times two.
That's, well,",00:14:44.956,00:14:48.551
"four plus eight,
12 minus one,",00:14:48.551,00:14:52.502
"11.
That, I think,",00:14:52.502,00:14:54.307
"is bigger than seven.
OK, so Q0 is not in the plane.",00:14:54.307,00:15:01.750
"Let's try again with Q1.
(1,3, - 1) well,",00:15:01.750,00:15:07.711
"if we plug that into x 2y 4z,
we'll have one plus two times",00:15:07.711,00:15:15.037
"three makes seven.
But, we add four times negative",00:15:15.037,00:15:20.781
"one.
We add up with three less than",00:15:20.781,00:15:23.461
"seven.
Well, that one is not in the",00:15:23.461,00:15:25.272
"plane, either.
So, I don't think,",00:15:25.272,00:15:27.793
"actually, that the answer
should be number three.",00:15:27.793,00:15:32.860
"So, let's get rid of answer
number three.",00:15:32.860,00:15:37.399
"OK, let's see,
in light of this,",00:15:37.399,00:15:42.657
"are you willing to reconsider
your answer?",00:15:42.657,00:15:50.120
"OK, so I think now everyone
seems to be interested in",00:15:50.120,00:15:53.649
"answering number two.
And, I would agree with that",00:15:53.649,00:15:57.652
"answer.
So, let's think about it.",00:15:57.652,00:16:00.399
"These points are not in the
plane, but they are not in the",00:16:00.399,00:16:02.728
"plane in different ways.
One of them somehow overshoots;",00:16:02.728,00:16:05.480
"we get 11.
The other one we only get 3.",00:16:05.480,00:16:08.093
"That's less than seven.
If you think about how a plan",00:16:08.093,00:16:12.045
"splits space into two half
spaces on either side,",00:16:12.045,00:16:15.960
"well, one of them is going to
be the point where x 2y 4z is",00:16:15.960,00:16:22.240
"less than seven.
And, the other one will be,",00:16:22.240,00:16:27.259
"so, that's somehow this side.
And, that's where Q1 is.",00:16:27.259,00:16:32.919
"And, the other side is where x
2y 4z is actually bigger than",00:16:32.919,00:16:43.733
"seven.
And, to go from one to the",00:16:43.733,00:16:47.735
"other, well, x 2y 4z needs to go
through the value seven.",00:16:47.735,00:16:53.389
"If you're moving along any path
from Q0 to Q1,",00:16:53.389,00:16:57.491
"this thing will change
continuously from 11 to 3.",00:16:57.491,00:17:02.139
"At some time,
it has to go through 7.",00:17:02.139,00:17:05.180
"Does that make sense?
So, to go from Q0 to Q1 we need",00:17:05.180,00:17:09.505
"to cross P at some place.
So, they're on opposite sides.",00:17:09.505,00:17:12.890
"OK, now that doesn't quite
finish answering the question",00:17:31.890,00:17:37.826
"that we had, which was,
where does the line intersect",00:17:37.826,00:17:43.438
"the plane?
But, why can't we do the same",00:17:43.438,00:17:46.464
"thing?
Now, we know not only the",00:17:46.464,00:17:48.568
"points Q0 and Q1,
we know actually any point on",00:17:48.568,00:17:51.706
"the line because we have a
parametric equation up there",00:17:51.706,00:17:55.090
"telling us,
where is the point that's",00:17:55.090,00:17:57.930
"moving on the line at time t?
So, what about the moving",00:17:57.930,00:18:04.808
"point, Q(t)?
Well, let's plug its",00:18:04.808,00:18:08.442
"coordinates into the plane
equation.",00:18:08.442,00:18:10.740
"So, we'll take x(t) 2y(t) 4z(t).
OK, that's equal to,",00:18:10.740,00:18:24.191
"well, (-1 2t) 2( 2 t) 4( 2 -
3t).",00:18:24.191,00:18:34.240
"So, if you simplify this a bit,
you get 2t 2t -12t.",00:18:34.240,00:18:41.140
"That should be -8t.
And, the constant term is minus",00:18:41.140,00:18:46.756
"one plus four plus eight is 11.
OK, and we have to compare that",00:18:46.756,00:18:54.123
"with seven.
OK, the question is,",00:18:54.123,00:18:57.414
"is this ever equal to seven?
Well, so, Q(t) is in the plane",00:18:57.414,00:19:07.478
"exactly when -8t 11 equals
seven.",00:19:07.478,00:19:16.180
"And, that' the same.
If you manipulate this,",00:19:16.180,00:19:20.880
"you will get t equals one half.
In fact, that's not very",00:19:20.880,00:19:27.453
"surprising.
If you look at these values,",00:19:27.453,00:19:30.030
"11 and three,
you see that seven is actually",00:19:30.030,00:19:32.842
"right in between.
It's the average of these two",00:19:32.842,00:19:35.973
"numbers.
So, it would make sense that",00:19:35.973,00:19:39.073
"it's halfway in between Q0 and
Q1, but we will get seven.",00:19:39.073,00:19:44.319
"OK, and that at that time,
Q at time one half,",00:19:44.319,00:19:50.332
"well, let's plug the values.
So, minus one plus 2t will be",00:19:50.332,00:19:59.957
"zero.
Two plus t will be two and a",00:19:59.957,00:20:04.765
"half of five halves,
and two minus three halves will",00:20:04.765,00:20:11.406
"be one half, OK?
So, this is where the line",00:20:11.406,00:20:15.450
intersects the plane.,00:20:15.450,00:20:16.780
"So, you see that's actually a
pretty easy way of finding where",00:20:43.970,00:20:47.066
"a line on the plane intersects
each other.",00:20:47.066,00:20:49.299
"If we can find a parametric
equation of a line and an",00:20:49.299,00:20:52.787
"equation of a plane,
but we basically just plug one",00:20:52.787,00:20:55.727
"into the other,
and see at what time the moving",00:20:55.727,00:20:59.674
"point hits the plane so that we
know where this.",00:20:59.674,00:21:04.660
"OK, other questions about this?
Yes?",00:21:04.660,00:21:23.410
"Sorry, can you say that?
Yes, so what if we don't get a",00:21:23.410,00:21:30.599
"solution?
What happens?",00:21:30.599,00:21:32.440
"So, indeed our line could have
been parallel to the plane or",00:21:32.440,00:21:36.377
"maybe even contained in the
plane.",00:21:36.377,00:21:38.779
"Well, if the line is parallel
to the plane then maybe what",00:21:38.779,00:21:42.408
"happens is that what we plug in
the positions of the moving",00:21:42.408,00:21:46.099
"point,
we actually get something that",00:21:46.099,00:21:48.164
"never equals seven because maybe
we get actually a constant.",00:21:48.164,00:21:50.940
"Say that we had gotten,
I don't know,",00:21:50.940,00:21:53.533
"13 all the time.
Well, when is 13 equal to seven?",00:21:53.533,00:21:56.720
"The answer is never.
OK, so that's what would tell",00:21:56.720,00:21:59.983
"you that the line is actually
parallel to the plane.",00:21:59.983,00:22:02.109
"You would not find a solution
to the equation that you get at",00:22:02.109,00:22:06.258
"the end.
Yes?",00:22:06.258,00:22:13.450
"So, if there's no solution at
all to the equation that you",00:22:13.450,00:22:16.295
"get, it means that at no time is
the traveling point going to be",00:22:16.295,00:22:19.441
"in the plane.
That means the line really does",00:22:19.441,00:22:22.055
"not have the plane ever.
So, it has to be parallel",00:22:22.055,00:22:25.136
"outside of it.
On the other hand,",00:22:25.136,00:22:27.186
"if a line is inside the plane,
then that means that no matter",00:22:27.186,00:22:30.709
"what time you choose,
you always get seven.",00:22:30.709,00:22:33.410
"OK, that's what would happen if
a line is in the plane.",00:22:33.410,00:22:37.225
"You always get seven.
So, maybe I should write this",00:22:37.225,00:22:44.094
"down.
So, if a line is in the plane",00:22:44.094,00:22:54.460
"then plugging x(t),
y(t), z(t) into the equation,",00:22:54.460,00:23:10.780
"we always get, 
well, here in this case seven",00:23:10.780,00:23:18.852
"or whatever the value should be
for the plane,",00:23:18.852,00:23:22.400
"If the line is parallel to the
plane -- -- in fact,",00:23:22.400,00:23:34.521
"we, well, get,
let's see, another constant.",00:23:34.521,00:23:45.430
"So, in fact,
you know, when you plug in",00:23:45.430,00:23:49.152
"these things,
normally you get a quantity",00:23:49.152,00:23:51.952
"that's of a form,
something times t plus a",00:23:51.952,00:23:54.262
"constant because that's what you
plug into the equation of a",00:23:54.262,00:23:57.809
"plane.
And so, in general,",00:23:57.809,00:23:59.261
"you have an equation of the
form, something times t plus",00:23:59.261,00:24:01.900
"something equals something.
And, that usually has a single",00:24:01.900,00:24:05.694
"solution.
And, the special case is if",00:24:05.694,00:24:08.249
"this coefficient of t turns out
to be zero in the end,",00:24:08.249,00:24:11.920
"and that's actually going to
happen,",00:24:11.920,00:24:14.119
"exactly when the line is either
parallel or in the plane.",00:24:14.119,00:24:20.450
"In fact, if you think this
through carefully,",00:24:20.450,00:24:24.039
"the coefficient of t that you
get here,",00:24:24.039,00:24:26.289
"see, it's one times two plus
two times one plus four times",00:24:26.289,00:24:30.536
"minus three.
It's the dot product between",00:24:30.536,00:24:33.578
"the normal vector of a plane and
the vector along the line.",00:24:33.578,00:24:37.859
"So, see, this coefficient
becomes zero exactly when the",00:24:37.859,00:24:41.558
"line is perpendicular to the
normal vector.",00:24:41.558,00:24:44.640
"That means it's parallel to the
plane.",00:24:44.640,00:24:46.440
"So, everything makes sense.
OK, if you're confused about",00:24:46.440,00:24:51.461
"what I just said,
you can ignore it.",00:24:51.461,00:24:55.070
"OK, more questions? No?
OK, so if not,",00:24:55.070,00:25:03.125
"let's move on to linear
parametric equations.",00:25:03.125,00:25:09.089
"So, I hope you've seen here
that parametric equations are a",00:25:09.089,00:25:13.921
"great way to think about lines.
There are also a great way to",00:25:13.921,00:25:18.646
"think about actually any curve,
any trajectory that can be",00:25:18.646,00:25:22.531
"traced by a moving point.
So -- -- more generally,",00:25:22.531,00:25:34.650
"we can use parametric equations
-- -- for arbitrary motions --",00:25:34.650,00:26:00.601
"-- in the plane or in space.
So, let's look at an example.",00:26:00.601,00:26:15.930
"Let's take, so,
it's a famous curve called a",00:26:15.930,00:26:20.221
"cycloid.
A cycloid is something that you",00:26:20.221,00:26:23.485
"can actually see sometimes at
night when people are biking If",00:26:23.485,00:26:27.870
"you have something that reflects
light on the wheel.",00:26:27.870,00:26:31.890
"So, let me explain what's the
definition of a cycloid.",00:26:31.890,00:26:33.930
"So, I should say,
I've seen a lecture where,",00:27:05.950,00:27:07.950
"actually, the professor had a
volunteer on a unicycle to",00:27:07.950,00:27:10.508
"demonstrate how that works.
But, I didn't arrange for that,",00:27:10.508,00:27:13.904
"so instead I will explain it to
you using more conventional",00:27:13.904,00:27:17.562
"means.
So, let's say that we have a",00:27:17.562,00:27:23.354
"wheel that's rolling on a
horizontal ground.",00:27:23.354,00:27:31.750
"And, as it's rolling of course
it's going to turn.",00:27:31.750,00:27:34.740
"So, it's going to move forward
to a new position.",00:27:34.740,00:27:40.990
"And, now, let's mention that we
have a point that's been painted",00:27:40.990,00:27:45.210
"red on the circumference of the
wheel.",00:27:45.210,00:27:47.890
"And, initially,
that point is here.",00:27:47.890,00:27:51.130
"So, as the wheel stops
rotating, well,",00:27:51.130,00:27:53.586
"of course, it moves forward,
and so it turns on itself.",00:27:53.586,00:27:57.369
"So, that point starts falling
back behind the point of contact",00:27:57.369,00:28:02.584
"because the wheel is rotating at
the same time as it's moving",00:28:02.584,00:28:07.714
"forward.
And so, the cycloid is the",00:28:07.714,00:28:12.124
"trajectory of this moving point.
OK, so the cycloid is obtained",00:28:12.124,00:28:21.509
"by considering,
so we have a wheel,",00:28:21.509,00:28:27.278
"let's say, of radius a.
So, this height here is (a)",00:28:27.278,00:28:38.025
"rolling on the floor which is
the x axis.",00:28:38.025,00:28:47.880
"And, let's -- And,
we have a point,",00:28:47.880,00:28:53.822
"P, that's painted on the wheel.
Initially, it's at the origin.",00:28:53.822,00:29:01.640
"But, of course,
as time goes by,",00:29:01.640,00:29:04.621
"it moves on the wheel.
P is a point on the rim of the",00:29:04.621,00:29:13.730
"wheel, and it starts at the
origin.",00:29:13.730,00:29:21.890
"So, the question is,
what happens?",00:29:21.890,00:29:27.829
"In particular,
can we find the position of",00:29:27.829,00:29:32.206
"this point, x(t),
y(t), as a function of time?",00:29:32.206,00:29:37.329
"So, that's the reason why I
have this computer.",00:29:37.329,00:29:42.619
"So, I'm not sure it will be
very easy to visualize,",00:29:42.619,00:29:48.733
"but so we have a wheel,
well, I hope you can vaguely",00:29:48.733,00:29:54.969
"see that there's a circle that's
moving.",00:29:54.969,00:30:00.350
"The wheel is green here.
And, there's a radius that's",00:30:00.350,00:30:05.419
"been painted blue in it.
And, that radius rotates around",00:30:05.419,00:30:09.678
"the wheel as the wheel is moving
forward.",00:30:09.678,00:30:12.859
"So, now, let's try to paint,
actually, the trajectory of a",00:30:12.859,00:30:23.839
"point.
[LAUGHTER]",00:30:23.839,00:30:26.425
"OK, so that's what the cycloid
looks like.",00:30:26.425,00:30:30.920
"[APPLAUSE]
OK, so -- So the cycloid,",00:30:30.920,00:30:37.056
"well, I guess it doesn't quite
look like what I've drawn.",00:30:37.056,00:30:47.400
"It looks like it goes a bit
higher up, which will be the",00:30:47.400,00:30:52.311
"trajectory of this red point.
And, see, it hits the bottom",00:30:52.311,00:30:57.718
"once in a while.
It forms these arches because",00:30:57.718,00:31:01.500
"when the wheel has rotated by a
full turn,",00:31:01.500,00:31:04.809
"then you're basically back at
the same situation,",00:31:04.809,00:31:07.099
"except a bit further along the
route.",00:31:07.099,00:31:09.890
"So, if we do it once more,
you see the point now is at the",00:31:09.890,00:31:13.491
"top, and now it's at the bottom.
And then we start again.",00:31:13.491,00:31:18.303
"It's at the top,
and then again at the bottom.",00:31:18.303,00:31:23.520
"OK.
No.",00:31:23.520,00:31:40.390
"[LAUGHTER]
OK, so the question that we",00:31:40.390,00:31:48.818
"want to answer is what is the
position x(t),",00:31:48.818,00:31:58.614
"y(t), of the point P?
OK, so actually,",00:31:58.614,00:32:05.645
"I'm writing x(t),
y(t).",00:32:05.645,00:32:07.650
"That means that I have,
maybe I'm expressing the",00:32:07.650,00:32:10.094
"position in terms of time.
Let's see, is time going to be",00:32:10.094,00:32:13.374
"a good thing to do?
Well, suddenly,",00:32:13.374,00:32:15.576
"the position changes over time.
But doesn't actually matter how",00:32:15.576,00:32:20.053
"fast the wheel is rolling?
No, because I can just play the",00:32:20.053,00:32:24.528
"motion fast-forward.
The wheel will be going faster,",00:32:24.528,00:32:27.772
"but the trajectory is still the
same.",00:32:27.772,00:32:29.750
"So, in fact,
time is not the most relevant",00:32:29.750,00:32:32.559
"thing here.
What matters to us now is how",00:32:32.559,00:32:36.010
"far the wheel has gone.
So, we could use as a",00:32:36.010,00:32:39.905
"parameter, for example,
the distance by which the wheel",00:32:39.905,00:32:44.470
"has moved.
We can do even better because",00:32:44.470,00:32:46.878
"we see that, really,
the most complicated thing that",00:32:46.878,00:32:49.180
"happens here is really the
rotation.",00:32:49.180,00:32:50.940
"So, maybe we can actually use
the angle by which the wheel has",00:32:50.940,00:32:55.210
"turned to parameterize the
motion.",00:32:55.210,00:32:57.730
"So, there's various choices.
You can choose whichever one",00:32:57.730,00:33:02.194
"you prefer.
But, I think here,",00:33:02.194,00:33:04.135
"we will get the simplest answer
if we parameterize things by the",00:33:04.135,00:33:07.517
"angle.
So, in fact,",00:33:07.517,00:33:10.978
"instead of t I will be using
what's called theta as a",00:33:10.978,00:33:23.884
"function of the angle,
theta, by which the wheel has",00:33:23.884,00:33:36.543
"rotated.
So, how are we going to do that?",00:33:36.543,00:33:50.990
"Well, because we are going to
try to use our new knowledge,",00:33:50.990,00:33:57.541
"let's try to do it using
vectors in a smart way.",00:33:57.541,00:34:03.190
"So, let me draw a picture of
the wheel after things have",00:34:03.190,00:34:07.712
"rotated by a certain amount.
So, maybe my point,",00:34:07.712,00:34:12.665
"P, now, is here.
And, so the wheel has rotated",00:34:12.665,00:34:18.180
"by this angle here.
And, I want to find the",00:34:18.180,00:34:21.887
"position of my point,
P, OK?",00:34:21.887,00:34:23.699
"So, the position of this point,
P, is going to be the same as",00:34:23.699,00:34:29.546
"knowing the vector OP from the
origin to this moving point.",00:34:29.546,00:34:35.489
"So, I haven't really simplify
the problem yet because we don't",00:34:35.489,00:34:39.398
"really know about vector OP.
But, maybe we know about",00:34:39.398,00:34:43.754
"simpler vectors where some will
be OP.",00:34:43.754,00:34:47.710
"So, let's see,
let's give names to a few of",00:34:47.710,00:34:50.375
"our points.
For example,",00:34:50.375,00:34:52.093
"let's say that this will be
point A.",00:34:52.093,00:34:54.849
"A is the point where the wheel
is touching the road.",00:34:54.849,00:34:58.179
"And, B will be the center of
the wheel.",00:34:58.179,00:35:02.820
"Then, it looks like maybe I
have actually a chance of",00:35:02.820,00:35:07.083
"understanding vectors like maybe
OA doesn't look quite so scary,",00:35:07.083,00:35:12.248
"or AB doesn't look too bad.
BP doesn't look too bad.",00:35:12.248,00:35:16.690
"And, if I sum them together,
I will obtain OP.",00:35:16.690,00:35:27.010
"So, let's do that.
So, now we've greatly",00:35:27.010,00:35:35.530
"simplified the problem.
We had to find one vector that",00:35:35.530,00:35:39.218
"we didn't know.
Now we have to find three",00:35:39.218,00:35:42.667
"vectors which we don't know.
But, you will see each of them",00:35:42.667,00:35:47.233
"as fairly easy to think about.
So, let's see.",00:35:47.233,00:35:50.710
"Should we start with vector OA,
maybe?",00:35:50.710,00:35:56.750
"So, OA has two components.
One of them should be very easy.",00:35:56.750,00:36:04.079
"Well, the y component is just
going to be zero,",00:36:04.079,00:36:06.596
"OK?
It's directed along the x axis.",00:36:06.596,00:36:10.510
"What about the x component?
So, OA is the distance by which",00:36:10.510,00:36:15.506
"the wheel has traveled to get to
its current position.",00:36:15.506,00:36:21.090
"Yeah.
I hear a lot of people saying R",00:36:21.090,00:36:23.536
"theta.
Let me actually say a(theta)",00:36:23.536,00:36:25.812
"because I've called a the radius
of the wheel.",00:36:25.812,00:36:28.720
"So, this distance is a(theta).
Why is it a(theta)?",00:36:28.720,00:36:33.769
"Well, that's because the wheel,
well, there's an assumption",00:36:33.769,00:36:36.366
"which is that the wheel is
rolling on something normal like",00:36:36.366,00:36:38.962
"a road,
and not on, maybe,",00:36:38.962,00:36:40.932
"ice, or something like that.
S So, it's rolling without",00:36:40.932,00:36:45.218
"slipping.
So, that means that this",00:36:45.218,00:36:48.079
"distance on the road is actually
equal to the distance here on",00:36:48.079,00:36:53.415
"the circumference of the wheel.
This point, P,",00:36:53.415,00:36:57.290
"was there, and the amount by
which the things have moved can",00:36:57.290,00:37:01.087
"be measured either here or here.
These are the same distances.",00:37:01.087,00:37:06.390
"OK, so, that makes it a(theta), 
and maybe I should justify by",00:37:06.390,00:37:15.422
"saying amount by which the wheel
has rolled,",00:37:15.422,00:37:22.010
"has moved, is equal to the, 
so, the distance from O to A is",00:37:22.010,00:37:30.674
"equal to the arc length on the
circumference of the circle from",00:37:30.674,00:37:37.464
"A to P.
And, you know that if you have",00:37:37.464,00:37:40.116
"a sector corresponding to an
angle, theta,",00:37:40.116,00:37:42.400
"then its length is a times
theta, provided that,",00:37:42.400,00:37:45.654
"of course, you express the
angel in radians.",00:37:45.654,00:37:48.840
"That's the reason why we always
used radians in math.",00:37:48.840,00:37:58.369
"Now, let's think about vector
AB and vector BP.",00:37:58.369,00:38:01.820
"OK, so AB is pretty easy,
right, because it's pointing",00:38:30.889,00:38:39.677
"straight up, and its length is
a.",00:38:39.677,00:38:45.480
"So, it's just zero, a.
Now, the most serious one we've",00:38:45.480,00:38:55.630
"kept for the end.
What about vector BP?",00:38:55.630,00:39:00.090
"So, vector BP,
we know two things about it.",00:39:00.090,00:39:04.429
"We know actually its length,
so, the magnitude of BP -- --",00:39:04.429,00:39:17.138
"a.
And, we know it makes an angle,",00:39:17.138,00:39:23.077
"theta, with the vertical.
So, that should let us find its",00:39:23.077,00:39:29.285
"components.
Let's draw a closer picture.",00:39:29.285,00:39:34.750
"Now, in the picture I'm going
to center things at B.",00:39:34.750,00:39:40.780
"So, I have my point P.
Here I have theta.",00:39:40.780,00:39:44.909
"This length is A.
Well, what are the components",00:39:44.909,00:39:49.805
"of BP?
Well, the X component is going",00:39:49.805,00:39:57.343
"to be?
Almost.",00:39:57.343,00:39:59.358
"I hear people saying things
about a, but I agree with a.",00:39:59.358,00:40:03.010
"I hear some cosines.
I hear some sines.",00:40:03.010,00:40:04.760
"I think it's actually the sine.
Yes.",00:40:04.760,00:40:07.576
"It's a(sin(theta)),
except it's going to the left.",00:40:07.576,00:40:10.590
"So, actually it will have a
negative a(sin(theta)).",00:40:10.590,00:40:18.690
"And, the vertical component,
well, it will be a(cos(theta)),",00:40:18.690,00:40:23.420
"but also negative because we
are going downwards.",00:40:23.420,00:40:27.510
"So, it's negative a(cos(theta)).
So, now we can answer the",00:40:27.510,00:40:46.355
"initial question because vector
OP, well, we just add up OA,",00:40:46.355,00:40:52.881
"AB, and BP.
So, the X component will be",00:40:52.881,00:40:57.175
"a(theta) - a(sin(theta)).
And, a-a(cos(theta)).",00:40:57.175,00:41:09.150
"OK.
So, any questions about that?",00:41:09.150,00:41:25.220
"OK, so, what's the answer?
Because this thing here is the",00:41:25.220,00:41:29.737
"x coordinate as a function of
theta, and that one is the y",00:41:29.737,00:41:35.584
"coordinate as a function of
theta.",00:41:35.584,00:41:39.380
"So, now, just to show you that
we can do a lot of things when",00:41:39.380,00:41:44.026
"we have a parametric equation,
here is a small mystery.",00:41:44.026,00:41:48.440
"So, what happens exactly near
the bottom point?",00:41:48.440,00:41:54.630
"What does the curve look like?
The computer tells us,",00:41:54.630,00:41:57.265
"well, it looks like it has some
sort of pointy thing,",00:41:57.265,00:41:59.974
"but isn't that something of a
display?",00:41:59.974,00:42:02.110
"Is it actually what happens?
So, what do you think happens",00:42:02.110,00:42:12.056
"near the bottom point?
Remember, we had that picture.",00:42:12.056,00:42:19.630
"Let me show you once more,
where you have these",00:42:19.630,00:42:24.616
"corner-like things at the
bottom.",00:42:24.616,00:42:28.409
"Well, actually,
is it indeed a corner with some",00:42:28.409,00:42:31.584
"angle between the two
directions?",00:42:31.584,00:42:34.000
"Does it make an angle?
Or, is it actually a smooth",00:42:34.000,00:42:38.045
"curve without any corner,
but we don't see it because",00:42:38.045,00:42:42.003
"it's too small to be visible on
the computer screen?",00:42:42.003,00:42:46.190
"Does it actually make a loop?
Does it actually come down and",00:42:46.190,00:42:50.884
"then back up without going to
the left or to the right and",00:42:50.884,00:42:55.434
"without making an angle?
So, yeah, I see the majority",00:42:55.434,00:43:01.039
"votes for answers number two or
four.",00:43:01.039,00:43:05.719
"And, well, at this point,
we can't quite tell.",00:43:05.719,00:43:08.510
"So, let's try to figure it out
from these formulas.",00:43:08.510,00:43:10.760
"The way to answer that for sure
is to actually look at the",00:43:10.760,00:43:17.105
"formulas.
OK, so question that we are",00:43:17.105,00:43:23.252
"trying to answer now is what
happens near the bottom point?",00:43:23.252,00:43:34.190
"OK, so how do we answer that?
Well, we should probably try to",00:43:52.850,00:43:58.724
"find simpler formulas for these
things.",00:43:58.724,00:44:03.219
"Well, to simplify,
let's divide everything by a.",00:44:03.219,00:44:06.620
"Let's rescale everything by a.
If you want,",00:44:06.620,00:44:08.746
"let's say that we take the unit
of length to be the radius of",00:44:08.746,00:44:12.127
"our wheel.
So, instead of measuring things",00:44:12.127,00:44:15.205
"in feet or meters,
we'll just measure them in",00:44:15.205,00:44:18.533
"radius.
So, take the length unit to be",00:44:18.533,00:44:25.242
"equal to the radius.
So, that means we'll have a=1.",00:44:25.242,00:44:32.210
"Then, our formulas are slightly
simpler.",00:44:32.210,00:44:35.150
"We get x(theta) is theta -
sin(theta), and y equals 1 - cos",00:44:35.150,00:44:45.845
"(theta).
OK, so, if we want to",00:44:45.845,00:44:49.069
"understand what these things
look like, maybe we should try",00:44:49.069,00:44:52.879
"to take some approximation.
OK, so what about",00:44:52.879,00:44:56.184
"approximations?
Well, probably you know that if",00:44:56.184,00:45:00.866
"I take the sine of a very small
angle, it's close to the actual",00:45:00.866,00:45:07.719
"angle itself if theta is very
small.",00:45:07.719,00:45:12.030
"And, you know that the cosine
of an angle that's very small is",00:45:12.030,00:45:18.515
"close to one.
Well, that's pretty good.",00:45:18.515,00:45:21.199
"If we use that,
we will get theta minus theta,",00:45:21.199,00:45:23.985
"one minus one,
it looks like it's not precise",00:45:23.985,00:45:26.709
"enough.
We just get zero and zero.",00:45:26.709,00:45:29.039
"That's not telling us much
about what happens.",00:45:29.039,00:45:31.679
"OK, so we need actually better
approximations than that.",00:45:31.679,00:45:39.170
"So -- So, hopefully you have
seen in one variable calculus",00:45:39.170,00:45:50.306
"something called Taylor
expansion.",00:45:50.306,00:45:57.340
"That's [GROANS].
I see that -- OK, ",00:45:57.340,00:46:14.639
"so if you have not seen Taylor
expansion,",00:46:14.639,00:46:17.039
"or somehow it was so traumatic
that you've blocked it out of",00:46:17.039,00:46:21.767
"your memory,
let me just remind you that",00:46:21.767,00:46:24.460
"Taylor expansion is a way to get
a better approximation than just",00:46:24.460,00:46:27.994
"looking at the function,
its derivative.",00:46:27.994,00:46:32.039
"So -- And, here's an example of
where it actually comes in handy",00:46:32.039,00:46:42.741
"in real life.
So, Taylor approximation says",00:46:42.741,00:46:52.812
"that if t is small,
then the value of the function,",00:46:52.812,00:47:01.445
"f(t), is approximately equal
to,",00:47:01.445,00:47:04.940
"well, our first guess,
of course, would be f(0).",00:47:04.940,00:47:07.930
"That's our first approximation.
If we want to be a bit more",00:47:07.930,00:47:12.615
"precise, we know that when we
change by t,",00:47:12.615,00:47:15.019
"well, t times the derivative
comes in,",00:47:15.019,00:47:17.969
"that's for linear approximation
to how the function changes.",00:47:17.969,00:47:23.849
"Now, if we want to be even more
precise, there's another term,",00:47:23.849,00:47:28.406
"which is t^2 over two times the
second derivative.",00:47:28.406,00:47:32.289
"And, if we want to be even more
precise, you will have t^3 over",00:47:32.289,00:47:37.587
"six times the third derivative
at zero.",00:47:37.587,00:47:41.090
"OK, and you can continue,
and so on.",00:47:41.090,00:47:43.880
"But, we won't need more.
So, if you use this here,",00:47:43.880,00:47:49.042
"it tells you that the sine of a
smaller angle,",00:47:49.042,00:47:53.313
"theta, well,
yeah, it looks like theta.",00:47:53.313,00:47:57.300
"But, if we want to be more
precise, then we should add",00:47:57.300,00:48:01.520
"minus theta cubed over six.
And, cosine of theta,",00:48:01.520,00:48:06.417
"well, it's not quite one.
It's close to one minus theta",00:48:06.417,00:48:12.544
"squared over two.
OK, so these are slightly",00:48:12.544,00:48:16.470
"better approximations of sine
and cosine for small angles.",00:48:16.470,00:48:21.449
"So, now, if we try to figure
out, again, what happens to our",00:48:21.449,00:48:28.395
"x of theta, well,
it would be,",00:48:28.395,00:48:31.809
"sorry, theta minus theta cubed
over six.",00:48:31.809,00:48:36.990
"That's theta cubed over six.
And y, on the other hand,",00:48:36.990,00:48:44.695
"is going to be one minus that.
That's about theta squared over",00:48:44.695,00:48:53.338
"two.
So, now, which one of them is",00:48:53.338,00:48:57.049
"bigger when theta is small?
Yeah, y is much larger.",00:48:57.049,00:49:01.340
"OK, if you take the cube of a
very small number,",00:49:01.340,00:49:03.990
"it becomes very,
very, very small.",00:49:03.990,00:49:06.019
"So, in fact,
we can look at that.",00:49:06.019,00:49:09.920
"So, x, an absolute value,
is much smaller than y.",00:49:09.920,00:49:15.659
"And, in fact,
what we can do is we can look",00:49:15.659,00:49:17.834
"at the ratio between y and x.
That tells us the slope with",00:49:17.834,00:49:21.800
"which we approach the origin.
So, y over x is,",00:49:21.800,00:49:27.451
"well, let's take the ratio of
this, too.",00:49:27.451,00:49:35.449
"That gives us three divided by
theta.",00:49:35.449,00:49:38.900
"That tends to infinity when
theta approaches zero.",00:49:38.900,00:49:45.530
"So, that means that the slope
of our curve,",00:49:45.530,00:49:53.731
"the origin is actually
infinite.",00:49:53.731,00:50:00.369
"And so, the curve picture is
really something like this.",00:50:00.369,00:50:05.090
"So, the instantaneous motion,
if you had to describe what",00:50:05.090,00:50:07.773
"happens very,
very close to the origin is",00:50:07.773,00:50:09.922
"that your point is actually not
moving to the left or to the",00:50:09.922,00:50:12.943
"right along with the wheel.
It's moving down and up.",00:50:12.943,00:50:17.670
"I mean, at the same time it is
actually moving a little bit",00:50:17.670,00:50:20.665
"forward at the same time.
But, the dominant motion,",00:50:20.665,00:50:24.242
"near the origin is really where
it goes down and back up,",00:50:24.242,00:50:29.130
"so answer number four,
you have vertical tangent.",00:50:29.130,00:50:33.670
"OK, I think I'm at the end of
time.",00:50:33.670,00:50:37.970
"So, have a nice weekend.
And, I'll see you on Tuesday.",00:50:37.970,00:50:44.000
"So, on Tuesday I will have
practice exams for next week's",00:50:44.000,00:50:47.902
"test.
 ",00:50:47.902,00:50:50.000
