PROFESSOR: So let's get ready.,00:00:23.120,00:00:26.280
"If good, you should
receive some handouts.",00:00:26.280,00:00:29.000
"So the TAs are walking around,
so you should slowly get those.",00:00:29.000,00:00:36.767
"This is the second
lecture on number theory,",00:00:36.767,00:00:38.600
"and we're going to cover
for a lot of stuff.",00:00:38.600,00:00:40.990
"And actually, we're
going to start",00:00:40.990,00:00:42.510
"with encryption, which is an
application of number theory.",00:00:42.510,00:00:48.540
"And we'll take that as a theme
throughout the whole lecture.",00:00:48.540,00:00:51.914
"And so, in this way, you can
see how useful number theory is.",00:00:51.914,00:00:54.455
"Now, encryption--
yeah, what is it?",00:00:58.410,00:01:02.040
"So let's first talk
about it a little bit.",00:01:02.040,00:01:04.680
"Maybe some of you
have heard about it.",00:01:04.680,00:01:06.820
"Cryptology in general is the
art of hiding information.",00:01:06.820,00:01:11.100
"And encryption is
a very useful tool.",00:01:11.100,00:01:13.660
"I'll only give a very
high level overview.",00:01:13.660,00:01:15.420
"I mean, if you really want
to know more about this,",00:01:15.420,00:01:17.544
"you should do a class in
crypto, or practical security.",00:01:17.544,00:01:22.401
So what's encryption?,00:01:22.401,00:01:23.275
"The idea is usually
that, beforehand, we're",00:01:29.520,00:01:32.970
"going to share a
whole bunch of keys.",00:01:32.970,00:01:39.490
"So keys are exchanged between
a receiver and a sender.",00:01:39.490,00:01:47.370
"And the whole idea is that
if I want to transmit, like,",00:01:47.370,00:01:51.140
"a message to one
of you, well, there",00:01:51.140,00:01:54.380
"could be someone
in the middle who",00:01:54.380,00:01:56.820
"wants to intercept
my message, and wants",00:01:56.820,00:01:59.560
to find out what I'm saying.,00:01:59.560,00:02:01.060
So I do not like this.,00:02:01.060,00:02:02.690
"And in order to avoid it,
I will use encryption,",00:02:02.690,00:02:07.560
"which is some kind of algorithm
that actually transforms",00:02:07.560,00:02:13.600
"my message m-- my plain
message-- by using",00:02:13.600,00:02:17.790
"some kind of algorithm, E.
Some encryption algorithm--",00:02:17.790,00:02:21.800
"it can be a function as
well-- that uses the keys",00:02:21.800,00:02:26.760
"in order to transform this
into an encryption, which",00:02:26.760,00:02:32.040
we call m prime here.,00:02:32.040,00:02:33.850
"So the plain text is, in the
clear, all the information",00:02:33.850,00:02:38.370
"that I want to convey to
one of you, for example.",00:02:38.370,00:02:41.260
"And m prime is somehow
a complete-- well,",00:02:41.260,00:02:48.480
"a mixture of bits,
out of which I'm not",00:02:48.480,00:02:52.190
"able to distill any information
about the plain text.",00:02:52.190,00:02:55.240
"So encryption to a very
special kind of thing.",00:02:55.240,00:02:58.080
"We're not going to talk about
the precise definitions here,",00:02:58.080,00:03:01.420
"but we just take the
ID into this lecture.",00:03:01.420,00:03:05.650
"Now, decryption is transforming
the cypher text back",00:03:05.650,00:03:10.810
into the plain text.,00:03:10.810,00:03:11.830
"So we will start with
the encryption, m prime,",00:03:11.830,00:03:17.190
"and we have some kind
of decryption algorithm.",00:03:17.190,00:03:19.820
"And again, we can make use
of the keys we exchanged.",00:03:19.820,00:03:24.050
"And we transform it back
into the plain message.",00:03:24.050,00:03:27.910
"So only if I know the
keys, I can actually",00:03:27.910,00:03:30.340
"transform back the encrypted
version into the plain version.",00:03:30.340,00:03:35.060
"So in encryption schemes we
like both these algorithms",00:03:35.060,00:03:38.980
to be is really efficient.,00:03:38.980,00:03:41.430
"And the security of such a
scheme-- well, the first kind",00:03:41.430,00:03:45.680
"of intuition that
we can get is well,",00:03:45.680,00:03:48.780
"if I'm a man in the
middle somewhere,",00:03:48.780,00:03:51.800
"intercepting an encrypted
message-- m prime--",00:03:51.800,00:03:55.740
"I should not be able to
get any information about m",00:03:55.740,00:03:58.840
"if I have no knowledge
about those keys.",00:03:58.840,00:04:02.400
"So this is the
example that we're",00:04:02.400,00:04:05.552
"going to take throughout
this whole lecture.",00:04:05.552,00:04:10.160
"So let's start with a
first possible scheme.",00:04:10.160,00:04:17.440
"Turing, who lived around
1936-- he was 24 years old--",00:04:17.440,00:04:25.380
"and he lived to
about-- actually,",00:04:25.380,00:04:29.760
"I think he was about
54 when he died.",00:04:29.760,00:04:32.780
"In any case, Turing was the one
who first originally proposed",00:04:32.780,00:04:37.600
"to use number theory
in cryptography.",00:04:37.600,00:04:40.350
"And before he joined the British
army, before the Second World",00:04:40.350,00:04:44.280
"War, he actually
proposed a scheme,",00:04:44.280,00:04:49.270
but it got never published.,00:04:49.270,00:04:50.700
"So here in this
class, we are going",00:04:50.700,00:04:52.480
"to try to think about what
he could have thought about.",00:04:52.480,00:04:56.000
"So we will have a
first scheme, which",00:04:56.000,00:04:59.540
"we will call Turing's
code, version number one.",00:04:59.540,00:05:04.510
"And the whole idea
is that we're going",00:05:04.510,00:05:07.490
"to translate a message first
of all into a prime number,",00:05:07.490,00:05:11.520
because we want to use numbers.,00:05:11.520,00:05:13.430
"We're here in
number theory class,",00:05:13.430,00:05:14.930
"so we want to use some
tricks with numbers in order",00:05:14.930,00:05:17.230
to encrypt it.,00:05:17.230,00:05:18.810
So let's do this.,00:05:18.810,00:05:19.800
"So for example, let's
take the word victory.",00:05:24.620,00:05:27.780
We can map this into an integer.,00:05:30.460,00:05:33.270
"For example, we could
say, well, m is 22,",00:05:33.270,00:05:38.850
"where I map V to--
because I know",00:05:38.850,00:05:42.250
"V is the 22nd letter in the
alphabet, I just start with 22.",00:05:42.250,00:05:46.600
"I is the ninth letter in the
alphabet, so I append 09.",00:05:46.600,00:05:52.890
"C is the third letter in the
alphabet, I append 3-- 03.",00:05:52.890,00:05:57.470
"I continue like this
and in end, over here",00:05:57.470,00:06:02.820
"I've mapped Y to
the 25th letter.",00:06:02.820,00:06:06.240
"Because it's the 25th letter
of alphabet, I write 25.",00:06:06.240,00:06:09.820
"It turns out, I can just
add a couple of digits",00:06:09.820,00:06:12.520
"more, if I specially
compute those.",00:06:12.520,00:06:15.030
"In this case, I could
add 13, and then it",00:06:15.030,00:06:18.630
changes into a prime number.,00:06:18.630,00:06:20.250
"Now we are not going to
talk about why this is,",00:06:23.990,00:06:26.000
"and how this can
be done, and so on.",00:06:26.000,00:06:27.810
"But it turns out that the
prime numbers are densely",00:06:27.810,00:06:31.350
"distributed over the integers,
and it's really possible to,",00:06:31.350,00:06:35.090
"just with a few extra
digits-- by selecting them",00:06:35.090,00:06:39.110
"in a smart way-- to actually
create a prime number.",00:06:39.110,00:06:41.820
"And also verify that it is a
prime number very efficiently.",00:06:41.820,00:06:45.100
"So it's very easy to compute--
to translate such a word",00:06:45.100,00:06:49.880
into a prime number.,00:06:49.880,00:06:51.490
So this is how it all starts.,00:06:51.490,00:06:53.600
"And just like in an
encryption scheme,",00:06:53.600,00:06:56.950
"beforehand we are going
to exchange a key.",00:06:56.950,00:07:04.490
"So we exchange the secret
prime in this example,",00:07:04.490,00:07:13.730
which we call k.,00:07:13.730,00:07:15.790
"And the encryption
is very simple.",00:07:15.790,00:07:20.030
"We are just going to
multiply m with k.",00:07:20.030,00:07:24.210
"Now, you may wonder why this
is such a fantastic idea.",00:07:24.210,00:07:27.050
But let's just bear with me.,00:07:27.050,00:07:29.750
"So m is this first prime
number, and we multiply it",00:07:29.750,00:07:33.970
"by a second prime
number, and that's",00:07:33.970,00:07:35.480
going to be our encryption.,00:07:35.480,00:07:38.810
Now how do we decrypt?,00:07:38.810,00:07:40.132
"That seems to be pretty
straightforward, right?",00:07:40.132,00:07:42.090
How do we do it?,00:07:42.090,00:07:44.560
We start off with m prime.,00:07:44.560,00:07:47.350
"I know we have exchanged
this secret prime k,",00:07:47.350,00:07:50.490
"so if I receive from
you this message--",00:07:50.490,00:07:54.110
"this encrypted message--
well, I know the key, k.",00:07:54.110,00:07:57.050
So I just divide it by k.,00:07:57.050,00:07:59.820
"Well, which is m k
divided k, and I get m.",00:07:59.820,00:08:05.030
"So that's pretty
straightforward.",00:08:05.030,00:08:07.730
"Now, as it turns out actually--
and I'll write it up here,",00:08:07.730,00:08:10.880
"because we need it later-- that
it's not so trivial to actually",00:08:10.880,00:08:16.900
"just give an m prime to
figure out what m is, or k.",00:08:16.900,00:08:23.020
"m prime is a product of two
very large prime numbers,",00:08:23.020,00:08:26.450
"and that turns out to be
a really hard problem.",00:08:26.450,00:08:28.996
"Up to now, nobody
has really been",00:08:28.996,00:08:30.370
"able to get a really efficient
algorithm to solve that.",00:08:30.370,00:08:34.159
So we may think this is secure.,00:08:34.159,00:08:36.610
"So let me write it down
It's hard to factor",00:08:36.610,00:08:45.630
a product of two large primes.,00:08:45.630,00:08:48.460
"You will actually
need this also,",00:08:57.850,00:08:59.830
"when we come to the final
encryption scheme-- RSA",00:08:59.830,00:09:02.970
"that we will discuss,
which is widely used.",00:09:02.970,00:09:05.580
"But something is
wrong here, though.",00:09:13.241,00:09:14.740
"This seems to be
too simple, right?",00:09:14.740,00:09:16.510
"So what can we do if
we have like, say,",00:09:16.510,00:09:19.040
"suppose I intercept
two encrypted messages.",00:09:19.040,00:09:22.970
What can I do?,00:09:22.970,00:09:23.680
"So suppose I have
a first message, m",00:09:31.800,00:09:35.900
"prime 1, which is the product
of a first plain message",00:09:35.900,00:09:39.920
"times the key, k.",00:09:39.920,00:09:41.800
"And I have a second
message that is",00:09:41.800,00:09:44.490
"encrypted by using the same
key, which is m 2 times k.",00:09:44.490,00:09:49.480
"Does anybody have an idea
what I could do here?",00:09:49.480,00:09:51.730
"AUDIENCE: Find the GCD and
that would give you the key.",00:09:51.730,00:09:55.400
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, you
could find the GCD",00:09:55.400,00:09:58.680
of m 1 prime and m 2 prime.,00:09:58.680,00:10:04.000
I've intercepted those two.,00:10:04.000,00:10:05.720
"Now, m 1 is a prime number.",00:10:05.720,00:10:08.220
"k is prime number, and
2 is a prime number.",00:10:08.220,00:10:10.160
"k is a prime number
here, also, right?",00:10:10.160,00:10:11.970
"So they're all relatively
prime towards one another.",00:10:11.970,00:10:16.690
"The GCD of these two-- well, the
greatest common divisor is k.",00:10:16.690,00:10:23.080
"So just by calculating the GCD
of the two encrypted messages,",00:10:23.080,00:10:27.390
"I'll be able to figure
out what k is-- the key.",00:10:27.390,00:10:33.070
"Well, if I know
the key, then I can",00:10:33.070,00:10:35.800
"do the decryption
of any cypher text,",00:10:35.800,00:10:38.440
"any encryption of a message
that I can intercept.",00:10:38.440,00:10:42.360
So this is not secure.,00:10:42.360,00:10:44.730
So how can we change this?,00:10:44.730,00:10:47.030
"Can we create a different
kind of encryption scheme?",00:10:47.030,00:10:53.870
"Let's do something
much more difficult,",00:10:53.870,00:10:56.710
"and then we will get into
modular arithmetic and things",00:10:56.710,00:11:01.550
like that.,00:11:01.550,00:11:02.387
So let's do this.,00:11:02.387,00:11:03.095
"So Turing's code,
version number two--",00:11:08.290,00:11:11.950
"we try to do something much
more complicated than just",00:11:11.950,00:11:15.420
multiplying by prime.,00:11:15.420,00:11:17.050
So let's do the following.,00:11:17.050,00:11:19.230
"So beforehand, we're
going to exchange not only",00:11:19.230,00:11:27.270
"a secret prime k, but we will
also exchange a public prime.",00:11:27.270,00:11:33.890
"So we exchange-- by public
we mean that anybody",00:11:33.890,00:11:39.430
can see this prime.,00:11:39.430,00:11:40.630
It's common knowledge.,00:11:40.630,00:11:42.790
"A public prime p, and
also a secret prime k.",00:11:42.790,00:11:54.240
"Let's see whether
this would work.",00:11:54.240,00:11:57.780
We have encryption.,00:11:57.780,00:11:58.595
"Well, we're going to start
out exactly the same way.",00:12:01.490,00:12:04.680
"First of all, I should tell you
how a message is represented.",00:12:07.870,00:12:11.450
"The message is going to be
represented as a number, m,",00:12:11.450,00:12:19.360
"in the range from 0, 1,
all the way to p minus 1.",00:12:19.360,00:12:25.270
"And we will compute the
encryption as follows.",00:12:25.270,00:12:31.988
"m is going to be the
remainder of m times k,",00:12:31.988,00:12:38.970
"after dividing out as many
multiples of p as possible.",00:12:38.970,00:12:42.930
"So notice we do kind
of the same thing.",00:12:42.930,00:12:45.560
"We just multiply
by k, but now we",00:12:45.560,00:12:47.830
"just take the remainder
after taking out",00:12:47.830,00:12:51.730
as many multiples of p.,00:12:51.730,00:12:55.080
"Well, let's see whether
we can do the decryption.",00:12:55.080,00:12:58.650
"It seems to be, like, a
next level of complexity.",00:12:58.650,00:13:01.950
"So maybe that'll
help us here, right?",00:13:01.950,00:13:04.900
So how will we do decryption?,00:13:04.900,00:13:06.750
"Well, somehow we would
like to divide by k.",00:13:06.750,00:13:09.630
"But we cannot really
do that, right?",00:13:09.630,00:13:11.940
This does not make any sense.,00:13:11.940,00:13:15.570
"So the decryption-- we
have no idea at this point",00:13:15.570,00:13:17.990
how to do this.,00:13:17.990,00:13:19.410
"And now we can get into
modular arithmetic,",00:13:19.410,00:13:23.070
"because it turns out that
we can sort of divide by k.",00:13:23.070,00:13:26.220
"There exists what we call
multiplicative inverse",00:13:26.220,00:13:29.790
of k modulo p.,00:13:29.790,00:13:31.720
"And I will explain all
those terminologies to you.",00:13:31.720,00:13:34.580
"And then we will be
able to take m prime,",00:13:34.580,00:13:39.260
and transform it back to m.,00:13:39.260,00:13:42.320
"So we will be able to get a
lot of this machinery going.",00:13:42.320,00:13:48.160
"So let's find out
how this works.",00:13:48.160,00:13:52.250
"So first of all, last time we
saw that we defined a and b",00:13:52.250,00:13:58.510
to be relatively prime.,00:13:58.510,00:13:59.870
So let me repeat that.,00:13:59.870,00:14:03.030
"So a and b are relatively
prime if and only",00:14:03.030,00:14:07.400
"if-- that's how we define
it-- if the GCD of a and b",00:14:07.400,00:14:13.190
is equal to 1.,00:14:13.190,00:14:13.810
"And in last lecture
and in the recitation,",00:14:13.810,00:14:17.610
"you got a different
proof, I think.",00:14:17.610,00:14:19.860
"And we proved that,
actually, the GCD of a and b",00:14:19.860,00:14:25.300
"is equal to the smallest
positive linear combination",00:14:25.300,00:14:28.560
of a and b.,00:14:28.560,00:14:30.780
"So that means that
one, in particular,",00:14:30.780,00:14:32.880
"is a linear
combination of a and b.",00:14:32.880,00:14:34.500
"So there exists
integers-- s and t--",00:14:34.500,00:14:39.010
"such that s times a,
plus t times b equals 1.",00:14:39.010,00:14:44.041
"It turns out that it can
also go the other way around,",00:14:44.041,00:14:46.290
"because if I can write one as
a linear combination of a b,",00:14:46.290,00:14:51.930
"well I cannot get much
lower than that, right?",00:14:51.930,00:14:54.060
"So that's really the smallest
possible that I can achieve.",00:14:54.060,00:14:56.730
So the GCD must be equal to 1.,00:14:56.730,00:15:00.080
"So this is a property
that we will be using.",00:15:00.080,00:15:01.940
"And from this property,
we can already figure out",00:15:06.130,00:15:09.910
an interesting property.,00:15:09.910,00:15:10.940
"So suppose we have a
linear combination that",00:15:10.940,00:15:13.500
looks like this.,00:15:13.500,00:15:15.100
"Then you can imagine
that, sort of,",00:15:15.100,00:15:17.720
"that s times a is equal
to 1, plus or minus",00:15:17.720,00:15:22.260
some linear multiple of b.,00:15:22.260,00:15:26.300
"So it's sort of-- s times
a is sort of equal to 1,",00:15:26.300,00:15:30.200
"you can say, up to
a multiple of b.",00:15:30.200,00:15:33.480
"So you can see a sort
of as an inverse of s.",00:15:33.480,00:15:39.000
"Because s times a is
equal to one, sort of.",00:15:39.000,00:15:42.380
"So this is what we're going
to use-- this kind of feeling.",00:15:42.380,00:15:45.660
"And in order to do that, we
are going to define congruency.",00:15:45.660,00:15:50.745
"So that's the first
definition for this lecture.",00:15:55.230,00:15:58.300
"We say x is congruent
to y modulo n,",00:15:58.300,00:16:10.940
"if-- which we denote as
follows-- x with three bars,",00:16:10.940,00:16:18.160
"y in between brackets, mod n.",00:16:18.160,00:16:22.460
"And we say that this is
the case if n divides",00:16:22.460,00:16:31.330
the difference between x and y.,00:16:31.330,00:16:34.150
"So let's have a look
at some examples.",00:16:34.150,00:16:36.845
"So let's take 31,
and I would like",00:16:44.580,00:16:49.130
"to show to you that
this is congruent to 16",00:16:49.130,00:16:53.250
"modulo, between brackets, 5.",00:16:53.250,00:16:57.570
Why is this?,00:16:57.570,00:16:58.550
"Well, I take the difference
between 31 and 16, which is 15,",00:16:58.550,00:17:02.910
"and I know that 15 is 3 times
5, so 5 divides this difference.",00:17:02.910,00:17:08.700
"And then by definition,
we can write it like this.",00:17:08.700,00:17:12.210
"And we say-- that's
the definition--",00:17:12.210,00:17:14.390
31 is congruent to 16 modulo 5.,00:17:14.390,00:17:17.730
"Another example is-- no, we
will stick with this example.",00:17:17.730,00:17:24.290
It's pretty clear.,00:17:24.290,00:17:26.569
"So once we have defined this,
we can continue and talk",00:17:26.569,00:17:31.920
"about this inverse that
I was talking about.",00:17:31.920,00:17:34.310
"So we like to, sort of, explain
in this encryption scheme",00:17:34.310,00:17:39.020
how we can divide by k.,00:17:39.020,00:17:42.540
"Actually, we would like to
multiply by an inverse of k.",00:17:42.540,00:17:46.310
"And we're going to
use this framework.",00:17:46.310,00:17:50.420
"So we'll have a
new definition that",00:17:50.420,00:17:54.140
"talks about the
multiplicative inverse.",00:17:54.140,00:17:56.950
So it's a new concept.,00:17:56.950,00:17:59.180
"And you'll give a
couple of examples.",00:17:59.180,00:18:01.780
"So the multiplicative
inverse of x modulo n",00:18:01.780,00:18:15.350
"is a number, which we
denote by x and then minus 1",00:18:15.350,00:18:24.240
on top of here.,00:18:24.240,00:18:27.290
"It's a number in the interval 0,
1, all the way up to n minus 1.",00:18:27.290,00:18:34.960
"Such that x times
x inverse-- so x",00:18:34.960,00:18:41.800
"times its
multiplicative inverse--",00:18:41.800,00:18:44.190
is congruent to 1 modulo n.,00:18:44.190,00:18:49.440
"So this is the definition
for a multiplicative inverse.",00:18:49.440,00:18:52.810
So let's have some examples.,00:18:52.810,00:18:55.180
So let's do that over here.,00:19:00.440,00:19:02.890
"For example, we have that 2
times 3-- which equals 6--",00:19:02.890,00:19:10.690
is equal to 1 modulo 5.,00:19:10.690,00:19:15.900
Why is this?,00:19:15.900,00:19:16.680
"Well, 6 minus 1
is divisible by 5,",00:19:16.680,00:19:20.310
"so I know is congruent
to 1 modulo 5.",00:19:20.310,00:19:24.720
So what does this mean?,00:19:24.720,00:19:27.130
"Well, we can say
that two is actually",00:19:27.130,00:19:29.160
"equal to the multiplicative
inverse of 3 modulo 5.",00:19:29.160,00:19:36.460
"We can also say that write 3
is the multiplicative inverse",00:19:36.460,00:19:42.060
of 2 modulo 5.,00:19:42.060,00:19:45.450
"Let's have another example, just
to make it a little bit more",00:19:45.450,00:19:48.800
clear.,00:19:48.800,00:19:51.150
"We know that 5
times 5 equals 25,",00:19:51.150,00:19:54.370
"and this is
congruent to 1 modulo",00:19:54.370,00:19:57.370
"6, because 25 is
1 plus 4 times 6.",00:19:57.370,00:20:03.150
"So now we see something
funny happening,",00:20:03.150,00:20:05.040
"because 5 is actually equal to
its own multiplicative inverse",00:20:05.040,00:20:11.030
modulo 6.,00:20:11.030,00:20:11.720
"So are there any questions
about these concepts?",00:20:18.470,00:20:21.310
"Because these are really
basic for the whole lecture,",00:20:21.310,00:20:24.630
"and this is what you really
need to understand if you do",00:20:24.630,00:20:27.073
all the problem sets as well.,00:20:27.073,00:20:29.990
Are there any questions?,00:20:29.990,00:20:32.160
"So now we can
actually start talking",00:20:32.160,00:20:36.910
"about this second version of the
Turing code that we invented.",00:20:36.910,00:20:44.670
"Let's have a look
at this remainder.",00:20:44.670,00:20:46.450
So let's write it out again.,00:20:46.450,00:20:48.430
"The remainder of m times
k, after dividing out",00:20:48.430,00:20:53.750
as many multiples of p.,00:20:53.750,00:20:56.230
"Well, we know that this is
congruent to m times k modulo",00:20:56.230,00:21:02.030
p.,00:21:02.030,00:21:03.990
So why is this?,00:21:03.990,00:21:06.020
"Well, we just apply the
definition over here.",00:21:06.020,00:21:08.562
"We take the difference
between those two.",00:21:08.562,00:21:10.270
"So here we have the
remainder of m times k,",00:21:10.270,00:21:14.810
"after dividing out as
many multiples of p.",00:21:14.810,00:21:18.930
"And if you subtract
that from m times k,",00:21:18.930,00:21:22.470
"well then we have something
that is a multiple of p,",00:21:22.470,00:21:26.350
"because that's what
we divided out.",00:21:26.350,00:21:28.560
"So the difference
is a multiple of p,",00:21:28.560,00:21:32.570
"so that means that p
divides the difference.",00:21:32.570,00:21:34.810
"And that's the definition of
saying that this remainder is",00:21:34.810,00:21:37.950
congruent m k modulo p.,00:21:37.950,00:21:40.540
"So this is kind of
interesting, because now we",00:21:40.540,00:21:44.750
"can rewrite over there--
well, not really rewrite,",00:21:44.750,00:21:48.570
"but we can use this to analyze
the encryption over here.",00:21:48.570,00:21:53.240
"So m prime is equal
to this remainder.",00:21:53.240,00:21:58.640
"And we get a
beautifully equation.",00:21:58.640,00:22:00.070
"We see that the encryption is
congruent to the plain message,",00:22:00.070,00:22:04.260
times the key modulo p.,00:22:04.260,00:22:06.930
So how do I do decryption?,00:22:06.930,00:22:09.140
"I can use the multiplicative
inverse of k, right?",00:22:09.140,00:22:12.330
So then I can divide k out.,00:22:12.330,00:22:15.510
So let's write this out as well.,00:22:18.770,00:22:20.640
"So suppose I have a
multiplicative inverse--",00:22:20.640,00:22:25.410
"k to the power minus 1-- that
is congruent to 1 modulo p.",00:22:25.410,00:22:33.230
Why do I do this?,00:22:33.230,00:22:34.710
Why am I writing this out?,00:22:34.710,00:22:36.870
"Because you will see
that it is not always",00:22:36.870,00:22:39.950
"possible to have a
multiplicative inverse.",00:22:39.950,00:22:42.840
"That's going to be
really a big problem.",00:22:42.840,00:22:45.170
"And that's where all
these other functions",00:22:45.170,00:22:50.380
"come in-- the Euler totient
function and Euler's theorem,",00:22:50.380,00:22:53.330
and so on.,00:22:53.330,00:22:55.020
"So it's not really
always the case.",00:22:55.020,00:22:56.910
"We'll give an
example in a moment.",00:22:56.910,00:22:58.410
"But suppose that we have a
multiplicative inverse-- modulo",00:22:58.410,00:23:02.610
"p-- well, then I'm
able to easily compute.",00:23:02.610,00:23:08.130
"I take m prime, I multiply
it with k inverse.",00:23:08.130,00:23:13.810
"Well, I'm substituting for
m prime, m times k-- times",00:23:13.810,00:23:21.630
k inverse.,00:23:21.630,00:23:22.600
I still have this left.,00:23:22.600,00:23:24.500
"Now I can say that this
is equal to 1 modulo p.",00:23:24.500,00:23:29.690
"So this is equal, or is
congruent, to m modulo p.",00:23:32.220,00:23:39.030
"So now we see how we
can do decryption.",00:23:39.030,00:23:41.440
"We simply use the
multiplicative inverse of k.",00:23:41.440,00:23:45.090
"And as in the first
Turing code, we",00:23:45.090,00:23:48.700
"are able to somehow
divide out-- so where",00:23:48.700,00:23:51.710
did I have it-- to divide out k.,00:23:51.710,00:23:54.346
"I did it very differently--
I have a very different",00:23:54.346,00:23:56.470
"mathematical structure-- but the
idea is, essentially, the same.",00:23:56.470,00:24:01.090
"I have a multiplicative
inverse of k,",00:24:01.090,00:24:04.720
"and if I multiply this
with the encryption,",00:24:04.720,00:24:07.710
"I will get the plain
message, modulo p.",00:24:07.710,00:24:10.920
"So, am I finished
now is the question.",00:24:10.920,00:24:13.660
"Well, I know that m is in the
range of 0, 1, all the way up",00:24:13.660,00:24:21.150
to p minus 1.,00:24:21.150,00:24:23.480
"So this means that I
can also rewrite m as--",00:24:23.480,00:24:29.150
"and I use a similar trick
as what I did over here--",00:24:29.150,00:24:32.300
"I can rewrite m as they
remainder of m prime times k",00:24:32.300,00:24:39.090
"inverse, after dividing out as
many copies of p as possible.",00:24:39.090,00:24:45.210
"So what we did here
is to first prove",00:24:45.210,00:24:48.590
"that the difference between
those two is a multiple of p.",00:24:48.590,00:24:53.290
"That's essentially
what congruent modulo p",00:24:53.290,00:24:56.730
means-- that's the definition.,00:24:56.730,00:24:59.350
"So now that I know that the
difference is a multiple of p,",00:24:59.350,00:25:02.890
"and if I know that m is actually
in this range up to p minus 1,",00:25:02.890,00:25:09.350
"I can use what we
learned last lecture--",00:25:09.350,00:25:12.460
"and what the book was talking
about-- that the definition",00:25:12.460,00:25:16.230
"of the remainder of m prime
times k inverse-- this thing--",00:25:16.230,00:25:20.400
"after finding out
as many copies of p,",00:25:20.400,00:25:22.350
is exactly this plain message m.,00:25:22.350,00:25:25.440
"OK, so now we the decryption.",00:25:25.440,00:25:27.234
So this is decryption.,00:25:27.234,00:25:28.150
And that sounds great.,00:25:30.870,00:25:35.040
"So now, of course, we
are wondering, well,",00:25:35.040,00:25:38.520
"if we can do this, can we also
attack this scheme, right?",00:25:38.520,00:25:43.170
Can we do something bad with it?,00:25:43.170,00:25:46.920
"Well, it can be used
to break this code,",00:25:46.920,00:25:49.380
"but in a slightly
more complicated way.",00:25:49.380,00:25:52.730
So let's see where I put that.,00:25:55.700,00:25:59.750
"Right, so what we are
going to use, now-- so when",00:25:59.750,00:26:04.290
"we talk about
security, and so on,",00:26:04.290,00:26:06.700
"you can think of
all kinds of ways",00:26:06.700,00:26:08.560
to break an encryption scheme.,00:26:08.560,00:26:10.940
"So we started out with,
in the first version,",00:26:10.940,00:26:14.620
"well, what if I just
know the encryption?",00:26:14.620,00:26:17.140
"And then, well, I cannot know
anything about the plain text,",00:26:17.140,00:26:21.940
"simply because I know that it's
very hard to factor a product",00:26:21.940,00:26:25.720
of two large primes.,00:26:25.720,00:26:27.080
"Then I said, but suppose
I know a little bit more",00:26:27.080,00:26:29.920
as an adversary.,00:26:29.920,00:26:30.660
"Suppose I have a
plain message together",00:26:30.660,00:26:33.580
with an encrypted message.,00:26:33.580,00:26:37.430
"Well, then I could
do this GCD trick",00:26:37.430,00:26:39.600
"and figure out and
break the scheme.",00:26:39.600,00:26:43.000
"And now we're going to
do something similar.",00:26:43.000,00:26:45.310
"And we say, well, suppose that
I do not know two encryptions,",00:26:45.310,00:26:52.290
but I know a plain message.,00:26:52.290,00:26:55.470
"And in corresponding,
encrypted message.",00:26:55.470,00:26:59.000
"So if I know such a pair,
which is-- I mean, in practice,",00:26:59.000,00:27:03.170
"such type of information
will be leaked.",00:27:03.170,00:27:06.220
"Then in this case,
I can break it.",00:27:06.220,00:27:07.740
"So we call this the known
the plain text attack.",00:27:07.740,00:27:12.700
"And it assumes that we
know-- as an adversary,",00:27:12.700,00:27:21.760
"I know a message-- a plain
message, m-- and also",00:27:21.760,00:27:31.010
"an encryption of this
message, m prime.",00:27:31.010,00:27:40.330
"And m prime, according
to this scheme,",00:27:40.330,00:27:42.300
"is the remainder of m times
k, after the dividing out",00:27:42.300,00:27:47.590
"as many multiples
of p as possible.",00:27:47.590,00:27:51.480
"Now, we saw-- now,
suppose I know these two.",00:27:51.480,00:27:54.330
"I'm going to show
you how to break it.",00:27:54.330,00:27:56.550
So let's have a look.,00:27:56.550,00:27:59.750
"The encryption, m prime, is
congruent to m times k modulo",00:27:59.750,00:28:04.860
p.,00:28:04.860,00:28:06.160
We just proved it over here.,00:28:06.160,00:28:09.100
And what do we know?,00:28:09.100,00:28:11.740
"We know that p is
a public prime.",00:28:11.740,00:28:14.400
I know p.,00:28:14.400,00:28:16.590
"Since it's a prime, I know that
the GCD of m and p equals 1.",00:28:16.590,00:28:24.290
"So these two are
relatively prime.",00:28:24.290,00:28:26.630
"So now if they are
relatively prime--",00:28:26.630,00:28:29.500
"and that's what
we wrote up here--",00:28:29.500,00:28:31.620
"we know that there exists
this linear combination",00:28:31.620,00:28:35.080
"of, in this case, m and
p that is equal to 1.",00:28:35.080,00:28:43.310
"And this way we
can figure out how",00:28:43.310,00:28:45.740
"to compute the inverse-- the
multiplicative inverse of m.",00:28:45.740,00:28:51.590
"So that's what
we're going to do.",00:28:51.590,00:28:54.020
"So we can compute and the
multiplicative inverse, such",00:28:54.020,00:29:01.870
"that m times m inverse is
congruent to 1 modulo p.",00:29:01.870,00:29:09.250
So now we can do the next step.,00:29:12.040,00:29:15.190
So what could I do next?,00:29:15.190,00:29:17.780
"So let's see, if I
have such an inverse,",00:29:17.780,00:29:21.890
"then I can take my
encrypted message",00:29:21.890,00:29:25.530
"that I have as an
attacker, which is m prime.",00:29:25.530,00:29:30.330
"I know m, and
since p was public,",00:29:30.330,00:29:33.310
"I can compute this
multiplicative inverse.",00:29:33.310,00:29:36.150
"So I could just
compute this product,",00:29:36.150,00:29:40.370
"and I know that this is actually
equal to, well, k times m times",00:29:40.370,00:29:46.350
m inverse.,00:29:46.350,00:29:47.580
"This is again equal to--
congruent to 1 modulo p.",00:29:47.580,00:29:51.370
So this is equal to k modulo p.,00:29:51.370,00:29:55.700
"So now, all of a sudden,
I know k modulo p,",00:29:55.700,00:29:59.080
because I know those two.,00:29:59.080,00:30:01.060
"So if I know k, I can compute
its multiplicative inverse.",00:30:01.060,00:30:06.990
"So I can compute k
inverse modulo p.",00:30:06.990,00:30:13.230
"And if I know k
inverse, again, I",00:30:13.230,00:30:15.930
"can use it to decrypt any
other encrypted message",00:30:15.930,00:30:20.690
that I receive.,00:30:20.690,00:30:22.290
"So for all future
encrypted messages,",00:30:22.290,00:30:25.220
"I do not need anymore
the plain messages.",00:30:25.220,00:30:28.460
"I've already used-- just
by using one plain message",00:30:28.460,00:30:32.990
"encryption pair, I have been
able to compute the secret key,",00:30:32.990,00:30:37.280
and the whole scheme is broken.,00:30:37.280,00:30:39.990
"So security is kind of
an interesting science.",00:30:39.990,00:30:46.890
"We can always think
of more tricks",00:30:46.890,00:30:49.040
"to break schemes, or
other assumptions,",00:30:49.040,00:30:53.480
"that we haven't
thought about before.",00:30:53.480,00:30:56.070
"And so now, let's talk about--
so what did we do here?",00:30:56.070,00:31:02.120
"We have been talking about
encryption-- these two schemes.",00:31:04.750,00:31:10.900
"We talked about
modular arithmetic.",00:31:10.900,00:31:14.050
"We talked about
congruence, and also",00:31:14.050,00:31:16.060
the multiplicative inverse.,00:31:16.060,00:31:18.060
"And we showed how to use that
to break Turing's code, version",00:31:18.060,00:31:22.490
number two.,00:31:22.490,00:31:24.080
"So we need something
much more fundamental",00:31:24.080,00:31:26.910
"in order to create a scheme
that is really secure.",00:31:26.910,00:31:30.300
"And that's what we're
going to do now.",00:31:30.300,00:31:32.070
"We're going to start off with
Euler's totient function,",00:31:32.070,00:31:35.820
and improve a related theorem.,00:31:35.820,00:31:38.780
"And with that we will be
able to actually explain",00:31:38.780,00:31:43.070
"RSA algorithm, which is a
famous algorithm invented here",00:31:43.070,00:31:46.490
"at MIT in 1977, by Rivest,
Shamir, and Adleman.",00:31:46.490,00:31:52.760
"And they actually also
got the Turing Award",00:31:52.760,00:31:55.820
for this a few years ago.,00:31:55.820,00:31:58.600
"And it's widely
used in practice.",00:31:58.600,00:32:03.200
"But we will be able
to actually explain",00:32:03.200,00:32:05.070
"this algorithm with just this
fundamental piece of number",00:32:05.070,00:32:08.770
theory.,00:32:08.770,00:32:09.490
So that's really exciting.,00:32:09.490,00:32:10.962
So let's do this.,00:32:10.962,00:32:11.670
"So we're going to first define
Euler's totient function.",00:32:16.390,00:32:20.425
"And it's related to this
multiplicative inverse.",00:32:31.290,00:32:33.580
"This function is
denoted phi of n,",00:32:48.510,00:32:52.890
"and it denote the
number of the integers",00:32:52.890,00:33:10.350
"in 1, 2, 3-- all the way
up to n minus 1, that",00:33:10.350,00:33:16.460
are relatively prime to n.,00:33:16.460,00:33:29.400
"So this just drops out of
the air, you may think.",00:33:29.400,00:33:35.280
"But this is a
fundamental quantity,",00:33:35.280,00:33:40.830
"and Euler's theorem is what
we will try to prove next.",00:33:40.830,00:33:43.830
"But let's give a
couple of examples",00:33:43.830,00:33:45.750
"about this, just to
see how it works.",00:33:45.750,00:33:50.350
"So for example, let's
take n to be equal to 12.",00:33:53.430,00:33:58.070
"What would be the value of
Euler's totient function,",00:33:58.070,00:34:02.270
evaluated for 12?,00:34:02.270,00:34:05.150
"So if you take 12, we have the
following numbers to consider.",00:34:05.150,00:34:15.010
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10,11, and 12.",00:34:15.010,00:34:23.480
"So now, let's have a look.",00:34:23.480,00:34:24.900
"You want to count
the integers that",00:34:27.996,00:34:29.729
are relatively prime to 12.,00:34:29.729,00:34:31.850
"Well, 1 is relatively
prime to 12.",00:34:34.429,00:34:37.230
Why is that?,00:34:37.230,00:34:38.179
"Because to GCD of 12
and 1 is equal to 1,",00:34:38.179,00:34:42.570
"and that's the definition
of being relatively prime.",00:34:42.570,00:34:44.770
So this is a good number.,00:34:44.770,00:34:47.510
"The GCD of 12 and 2, well
both are divisible by 2.",00:34:47.510,00:34:52.730
"So they're not relatively
prime, because the GCD",00:34:52.730,00:34:55.685
is at least two.,00:34:55.685,00:34:56.909
"In this case, equal to 2.",00:34:56.909,00:34:59.120
3 also divides 12.,00:34:59.120,00:35:01.388
4 divides 12.,00:35:01.388,00:35:03.410
"5 is relatively prime
with respect to 12.",00:35:03.410,00:35:07.020
"6 actually is
dividing 12 as well.",00:35:07.020,00:35:11.500
"7 is relatively prime,
and 11 over here as well.",00:35:11.500,00:35:16.680
"And all the others have
a greatest common divisor",00:35:16.680,00:35:19.510
that's larger than 1.,00:35:19.510,00:35:21.390
"So here we see that the Euler's
totient function evaluated",00:35:21.390,00:35:26.010
in 12 is equal to 4.,00:35:26.010,00:35:28.100
"There are one, two,
three, four integers",00:35:28.100,00:35:31.720
that are relatively prime.,00:35:31.720,00:35:34.250
"OK, so let's have
a different one.",00:35:34.250,00:35:36.800
"Say, n equals 15.",00:35:36.800,00:35:39.200
"It's little bit different,
because here you",00:35:39.200,00:35:42.040
"may think this is kind
of coincidental that 1,",00:35:42.040,00:35:45.013
"5, 7, and 11 are
actually, also, primes.",00:35:45.013,00:35:48.870
"But for 15 it looks a
little bit different.",00:35:48.870,00:35:50.780
"So let's write out
all the numbers.",00:35:55.300,00:36:01.150
"Again, let's have a look.",00:36:01.150,00:36:02.590
"Well, one is the
greatest common divisor",00:36:02.590,00:36:04.750
"equal to 1, with respect to 15.",00:36:04.750,00:36:08.290
"2 is also relatively
prime, with respect to 15.",00:36:08.290,00:36:13.240
3 is dividing 15.,00:36:13.240,00:36:14.416
"4-- yeah, 4 and 15 have greatest
common divisor equal to 1.",00:36:14.416,00:36:20.200
So that's relatively prime.,00:36:20.200,00:36:23.400
5 is not.,00:36:23.400,00:36:25.200
6 is not.,00:36:25.200,00:36:25.930
7 is relatively prime.,00:36:25.930,00:36:27.540
"8-- again, this is only
divisible by power of 2,",00:36:27.540,00:36:31.260
"and this has no
power of 2 in it.",00:36:31.260,00:36:35.780
"9, 10 are-- this one is
divisible by 5, divisible by 3.",00:36:35.780,00:36:41.750
"11 is, again, relatively prime.",00:36:41.750,00:36:44.520
"And then we have 13 is
relatively prime as well.",00:36:44.520,00:36:48.100
"And 14 as well, because
this is 2 times 7,",00:36:48.100,00:36:50.460
and this is 3 times 5.,00:36:50.460,00:36:52.240
So how many do we see now?,00:36:52.240,00:36:53.880
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.",00:36:53.880,00:36:57.722
"So the Euler's totient
function evaluated in 15",00:37:01.660,00:37:04.570
is actually equal to 8.,00:37:04.570,00:37:05.540
"Now, it turns out
that this function has",00:37:05.540,00:37:10.240
"really nice properties,
and you can easily",00:37:10.240,00:37:13.560
"calculate-- if you know
the decomposition of n",00:37:13.560,00:37:18.610
"into its primes, and
powers of primes--",00:37:18.610,00:37:21.340
"you can easily compute
this number, phi of n.",00:37:21.340,00:37:28.190
"Now, you will be able to
find this in the book.",00:37:28.190,00:37:30.300
You should read it.,00:37:30.300,00:37:31.160
"And also, problem
set talks about this.",00:37:31.160,00:37:35.340
"But for now, let's
just talk about this",00:37:35.340,00:37:38.820
"is an abstract notion,
because that's all",00:37:38.820,00:37:40.950
"that we will use
in this lecture.",00:37:40.950,00:37:43.370
"But you will have
a few exercises",00:37:43.370,00:37:44.940
"to talk about computing
this kind of stuff.",00:37:44.940,00:37:48.170
"OK, so let's talk about Euler's
totient function and Euler's",00:37:48.170,00:37:58.410
theorem.,00:37:58.410,00:37:59.140
So let me use this blackboard.,00:37:59.140,00:38:04.325
"Now, this is really
an exciting theorem.",00:38:14.260,00:38:17.800
"And it's a little
bit hard to prove.",00:38:17.800,00:38:20.110
"So why we'll need a little
bit more time to do this.",00:38:20.110,00:38:24.810
"Euler's theorem
says the following.",00:38:24.810,00:38:27.430
"If the GCD of n and
k is equal to 1,",00:38:27.430,00:38:34.750
"then k to the power [INAUDIBLE]
the Euler's totient function",00:38:34.750,00:38:42.520
"evaluated in n is actually
congruent to 1 modulo n.",00:38:42.520,00:38:50.280
"So this is what we're
going to prove here.",00:38:50.280,00:38:52.340
So why is this so interesting?,00:38:52.340,00:38:54.920
"Well, we'll talk about
an application which",00:38:54.920,00:38:57.760
"is a direct consequence of
this theorem, which we'll",00:38:57.760,00:39:00.160
call Fermat's little theorem.,00:39:00.160,00:39:02.550
"And that, in turn, we will use
to explain the RSA algorithm,",00:39:02.550,00:39:07.430
"and show how the decryption
works, and so on.",00:39:07.430,00:39:11.480
So how can we prove this?,00:39:11.480,00:39:13.000
"It will start with
a first lemma,",00:39:21.450,00:39:37.570
"and then we're going to do a few
tricks-- mathematical tricks,",00:39:37.570,00:39:41.310
you will see it.,00:39:41.310,00:39:42.510
"So the first lemma
is that if I know",00:39:42.510,00:39:48.960
"that the GCD-- which is
what we are assuming,",00:39:48.960,00:39:52.120
"the statement of the theorum--
if I know that the GCD of n",00:39:52.120,00:39:55.646
"and k equals 1, then I
know that and a times k--",00:39:55.646,00:40:04.480
"if a times k is congruent
to b times k modulo n,",00:40:04.480,00:40:12.720
"then this applies that a
is congruent to b modulo n.",00:40:12.720,00:40:17.890
"All this seems to be kind
of a straightforward lemma.",00:40:17.890,00:40:21.435
"I will only talk
about its proof.",00:40:21.435,00:40:24.180
So how do we do it?,00:40:24.180,00:40:25.550
"Well, first of all, I know that
the GCD of n and k equals 1.",00:40:25.550,00:40:29.790
"So that means that I can create
a multiplicative inverse,",00:40:29.790,00:40:36.440
"because I know that there's
such a linear combination that",00:40:36.440,00:40:41.970
will ends up to 1.,00:40:41.970,00:40:46.240
"So I have the
multiplicative inverse.",00:40:46.240,00:40:50.140
"I multiply both sides with
this, and then I will end up to,",00:40:50.140,00:40:55.330
a is congruent to b modulo n.,00:40:55.330,00:40:57.230
"And actually, you can
use some of the facts",00:40:57.230,00:40:59.300
on your sheet to prove this.,00:40:59.300,00:41:02.670
"And in the problem
set, you probably",00:41:02.670,00:41:05.280
"have seen that there
are a number of problems",00:41:05.280,00:41:09.020
related to this.,00:41:09.020,00:41:09.875
"So you will recognize this,
and prove a few of these things",00:41:13.080,00:41:15.610
yourself.,00:41:15.610,00:41:17.410
"OK, so this is-- so let me see.",00:41:17.410,00:41:24.570
"So let me see what
we have done here.",00:41:29.380,00:41:31.960
"Actually, I noticed that
I've missed one statement",00:41:34.610,00:41:37.680
"that I would like to
explicitly mention.",00:41:37.680,00:41:40.600
"I mean, I've used
it a few times.",00:41:40.600,00:41:43.510
Let me do that first.,00:41:43.510,00:41:45.740
"Which is that, we know that if
the GCD of n and k equals 1,",00:41:45.740,00:41:56.740
"then-- this is if, and
only if, the case-- if k",00:41:56.740,00:42:02.460
"has a multiplicative inverse--
I've not yet explicitly stated",00:42:02.460,00:42:09.780
"it-- and we can
easily see this--",00:42:09.780,00:42:16.400
"let me just give a quick
proof to show how this works.",00:42:16.400,00:42:21.000
"Well, if the GCD is
equal to 1, then we",00:42:23.960,00:42:31.050
use the statement up there.,00:42:31.050,00:42:34.090
"So this is if,
and only if, there",00:42:34.090,00:42:37.530
exists a linear combination.,00:42:37.530,00:42:40.470
"So an s and a t, such that
n times s plus k times t",00:42:40.470,00:42:46.250
equals 1.,00:42:46.250,00:42:48.170
"Well, then I also know that
there exists a t such that,",00:42:48.170,00:42:56.450
"actually, the difference
between 1 and k times t",00:42:56.450,00:43:01.280
is divisible by n.,00:43:01.280,00:43:03.740
"So n divides the difference
of k times t minus 1.",00:43:03.740,00:43:10.716
So why is that?,00:43:10.716,00:43:12.080
"Well, if I look at the
difference between k times",00:43:12.080,00:43:14.570
"t and 1, the difference
is n times s.",00:43:14.570,00:43:17.580
And n times s is divisible by n.,00:43:17.580,00:43:20.640
"So now, by the
definition of congruence,",00:43:20.640,00:43:24.480
"I just apply the
definition over here.",00:43:24.480,00:43:26.710
We have written it out here.,00:43:26.710,00:43:28.390
"We can say that k times t
is congruent to 1 modulo n.",00:43:28.390,00:43:37.470
"And this is the definition of
the multiplication inverse.",00:43:37.470,00:43:41.970
"So we have essentially
shown that if the greatest",00:43:41.970,00:43:46.000
"common divisors in
any case equal to 1,",00:43:46.000,00:43:48.650
"then it has a
multiplicative inverse.",00:43:48.650,00:43:52.380
"OK, we have been using
this property over",00:43:52.380,00:43:58.300
"here because we assume that
the greatest common divisor is",00:43:58.300,00:44:02.990
equal to 1.,00:44:02.990,00:44:03.860
"So we now know that there exists
a multiplicative inverse of k.",00:44:03.860,00:44:08.720
"We use that one to
multiply away, essentially,",00:44:08.720,00:44:13.440
"the k out of this
equation, and get",00:44:13.440,00:44:15.870
a is congruent to b modulo n.,00:44:15.870,00:44:19.320
"Also note that we use
the property over here.",00:44:19.320,00:44:24.160
"We said that we wanted to
compute, what was it again?",00:44:24.160,00:44:32.520
"Over here-- we started off
with the GCD of m and p",00:44:32.520,00:44:37.480
"to be equal to 1, and I know p.",00:44:37.480,00:44:40.280
"And now I can compute the
multiplicative inverse of m.",00:44:40.280,00:44:43.920
"And I should have
said why it exists.",00:44:43.920,00:44:46.930
"And it exists
because of that lemma",00:44:46.930,00:44:49.950
that I just mentioned up here.,00:44:49.950,00:44:53.140
"OK, so now let's go
back to Euler's theorem.",00:44:53.140,00:44:55.395
"This first lemma we are going
to use to prove a second lemma,",00:44:58.030,00:45:01.070
"and that second
lemma we can finally",00:45:01.070,00:45:03.030
use to prove the theorem.,00:45:03.030,00:45:04.850
"All right, so this lemma I
will put on a separate board,",00:45:07.610,00:45:15.570
"because it contains quite
a number of steps to prove.",00:45:15.570,00:45:18.205
"So the lemma states that, if we
suppose that the GCD of n and k",00:45:26.400,00:45:38.430
"equals 1-- so it's the same
assumptions as before-- if it",00:45:38.430,00:45:44.090
"lets k1 all the way up to k r to
be those integers in the range",00:45:44.090,00:45:53.580
"1, 2, 3, and so
on, to n minus 1,",00:45:53.580,00:45:59.970
"that are relatively
prime-- so these denote",00:45:59.970,00:46:05.000
"the integers relatively
prime to n-- then",00:46:05.000,00:46:15.640
"we can prove a very
interesting property.",00:46:15.640,00:46:18.555
"Now, notice by the
way, that r in here",00:46:21.270,00:46:24.690
"is equal to this value of
the Euler's totient function",00:46:24.690,00:46:28.780
evaluated in n.,00:46:28.780,00:46:30.380
"Because this counts
the total number",00:46:30.380,00:46:33.080
"of numbers that are relatively
prime with respect to n.",00:46:33.080,00:46:40.390
"So now we can prove
something really spectacular.",00:46:40.390,00:46:44.200
"We can show that the
set that contains",00:46:44.200,00:46:48.830
"all of these remainders--
the remainder of k 1 times k,",00:46:48.830,00:46:54.350
"after dividing out this
many multiples of n",00:46:54.350,00:46:57.170
"as possible, all the way to
the remainder off k r times k,",00:46:57.170,00:47:06.840
"after dividing out as many
multiples of n as possible,",00:47:06.840,00:47:12.590
"this set is actually equal
to the set k 1 up to k r.",00:47:12.590,00:47:18.810
"So this is what
we're going to prove.",00:47:18.810,00:47:20.910
And we'll do it in two steps.,00:47:20.910,00:47:23.280
"We first show that this
set has exactly r numbers.",00:47:23.280,00:47:29.630
"So the cardinality of
that set is equal to r.",00:47:29.630,00:47:32.570
"So that will be our
first step in the proof.",00:47:32.570,00:47:36.150
"And over here we will show that
every remainder is actually",00:47:36.150,00:47:42.400
"relatively prime to n, so
it must be part of this set.",00:47:42.400,00:47:46.420
"So we will show that this
is a subset of this set",00:47:46.420,00:47:49.580
in a second part of the proof.,00:47:49.580,00:47:51.770
"And combining those two, we
are able to prove equality.",00:47:51.770,00:47:55.450
Why's that?,00:47:55.450,00:47:56.435
"Well I have r distinct
elements in this set,",00:47:56.435,00:48:00.680
"I have r distinct elements
in this set, this one",00:48:00.680,00:48:04.290
is a subset of this.,00:48:04.290,00:48:05.450
"So that can only happen
if they are equal.",00:48:05.450,00:48:08.890
"So this is the
method for the proof.",00:48:08.890,00:48:12.910
"I should-- so we'll start
with the first part.",00:48:16.030,00:48:31.290
"And the way to do that is to
see whether it is possible",00:48:34.180,00:48:40.470
"that any two remainders
in that set, can they",00:48:40.470,00:48:47.840
be equal to one another?,00:48:47.840,00:48:48.860
"We will show that
that's not possible.",00:48:48.860,00:48:50.870
"So if it's not possible,
then all these remainders",00:48:50.870,00:48:54.490
must be different.,00:48:54.490,00:48:55.470
And we have exactly r of those.,00:48:55.470,00:48:57.790
So let's do this.,00:48:57.790,00:48:59.650
"So the proof for
1 is as follows.",00:48:59.650,00:49:04.690
"Let's assume that we
he have to remainders.",00:49:04.690,00:49:07.550
"Say, k i times k, and a
remainder k j times k,",00:49:07.550,00:49:17.330
"after dividing out as
many multiples of n.",00:49:17.330,00:49:19.210
"And supposed that they
are equal to one another.",00:49:19.210,00:49:22.000
"We're going to show
that this can only",00:49:22.000,00:49:25.120
happen if k i is equal to k j.,00:49:25.120,00:49:29.120
"And if you can see
that, well then",00:49:29.120,00:49:31.867
"we know that all these different
remainders are actually",00:49:31.867,00:49:34.200
different from one another.,00:49:34.200,00:49:35.500
"And if they're all
different from one another,",00:49:35.500,00:49:37.880
then we must have exactly r.,00:49:37.880,00:49:39.870
"Because we have k 1
up to k r in here.",00:49:39.870,00:49:44.140
"OK let's see where
we can do this.",00:49:44.140,00:49:48.610
"Well, if you know that
these two remainders are",00:49:48.610,00:49:52.210
"equal to one another, we can
look at them with respect",00:49:52.210,00:49:56.280
to these definitions over here.,00:49:56.280,00:49:58.940
"And we can show that k
i times k is actually",00:49:58.940,00:50:05.110
"congruent to k j
times k modulo n.",00:50:05.110,00:50:10.640
So why is this?,00:50:10.640,00:50:12.170
"Well, these two
remainders are the same.",00:50:12.170,00:50:15.620
"And k i times k is
equal to this remainder,",00:50:15.620,00:50:19.370
plus a multiple of n.,00:50:19.370,00:50:21.270
"This k j times k is equal
to this remainder plus,",00:50:21.270,00:50:25.650
a multiple of n.,00:50:25.650,00:50:27.350
"So the difference between those
two is also a multiple of n.",00:50:27.350,00:50:32.179
"And that's the
definition of congruence.",00:50:32.179,00:50:33.845
"So now we can use
our first lemma,",00:50:36.880,00:50:42.510
which is stated over here.,00:50:42.510,00:50:46.040
"We know that we assumed
in Euler's theorem",00:50:46.040,00:50:48.800
"that the GCD of n
and k is equal to 1.",00:50:48.800,00:50:52.570
"If a times k is congruent
to b times k modulo n,",00:50:52.570,00:50:57.170
"then we know that's a is
congruent to b modulo n.",00:50:57.170,00:50:59.910
"So let's apply it over
here, and take for a k",00:50:59.910,00:51:03.420
"i, and for b we can take k j.",00:51:03.420,00:51:07.270
"So now we see that key k i
is congruent to k j modulo n.",00:51:07.270,00:51:16.010
"And from this we will
conclude-- and that",00:51:16.010,00:51:19.300
"takes an extra step-- that k
i is actually equal to k j.",00:51:19.300,00:51:23.900
So how can we do this?,00:51:23.900,00:51:25.950
"Well, we know that k i and k
j are both in the range from 1",00:51:25.950,00:51:30.870
all the way up to n minus 1.,00:51:30.870,00:51:33.810
"So if I look at the
difference between those",00:51:33.810,00:51:38.000
"two-- so by definition
of congruence",00:51:38.000,00:51:39.950
"I know that n divides
k i minus k j.",00:51:39.950,00:51:46.780
"I know that this one is in the
range from 0 up to n minus 1.",00:51:46.780,00:51:52.790
"This one is in the range
of 0 up to n minus 1.",00:51:52.790,00:51:55.850
"The only way how a difference
of two numbers in this range",00:51:55.850,00:52:00.510
"can be divisible by n, is if
this thing is equal to zero.",00:52:00.510,00:52:05.250
"And that means that
k i equals k j.",00:52:05.250,00:52:09.170
"So now we are done
with the first part,",00:52:09.170,00:52:11.200
"because we have shown
that if I take any two",00:52:11.200,00:52:14.040
"remainders over here it
must be that they can only",00:52:14.040,00:52:18.990
"be equal to one another
if, actually, the k i is",00:52:18.990,00:52:21.425
equal to the k j.,00:52:21.425,00:52:22.300
"So actually we're looking
at the same remainder.",00:52:22.300,00:52:24.570
"So they remainders in this
set are all different,",00:52:24.570,00:52:27.950
"and there are
exactly r of those.",00:52:27.950,00:52:30.680
"So now we go to the
second part of the proof.",00:52:30.680,00:52:32.690
"And notice that we
are-- so far we've only",00:52:49.520,00:52:52.370
"been proving the second
lemma, and we still",00:52:52.370,00:52:54.470
"need to go to Euler's
theorem as well.",00:52:54.470,00:52:56.990
So it still takes a few steps.,00:52:56.990,00:52:58.375
So how do we do the second part?,00:53:02.560,00:53:05.430
"Well, we saw in last
lecture that we were",00:53:05.430,00:53:09.200
explaining Euclid's algorithm.,00:53:09.200,00:53:14.640
"And we used, essentially,
this property.",00:53:14.640,00:53:18.650
"We said that the greatest
common divisor between n",00:53:18.650,00:53:22.080
"and the remainder of
say, k i times k and n,",00:53:22.080,00:53:28.460
"is actually equal to the
greatest common divisor of n",00:53:28.460,00:53:33.750
and k i times k.,00:53:33.750,00:53:36.265
"So why is this, again?",00:53:39.090,00:53:40.340
"Well, the remaining is
actually equal to k i times k,",00:53:40.340,00:53:46.320
"minus a multiple of n, right?",00:53:46.320,00:53:48.680
"So the greatest common
divisor is therefore--",00:53:48.680,00:53:53.080
"between n and this-- is the same
as the greatest common divisor",00:53:53.080,00:53:55.720
between n and k i times k.,00:53:55.720,00:53:57.840
"So you should have to
look at last lecture.",00:53:57.840,00:54:00.210
And now we are pretty much done.,00:54:00.210,00:54:04.250
Why is this?,00:54:04.250,00:54:04.790
"Because we have assumed that
the greatest common divisor",00:54:04.790,00:54:07.800
between n and k is equal to 1.,00:54:07.800,00:54:11.631
"And k i, in the
statement of the lemma,",00:54:11.631,00:54:15.150
is relatively prime to n.,00:54:15.150,00:54:17.180
"And that means, according to
the definition over there,",00:54:17.180,00:54:20.770
"that the greatest common
divisor between k i and n",00:54:20.770,00:54:23.830
is also equal to 1.,00:54:23.830,00:54:25.330
"So we know that both
these greatest common",00:54:25.330,00:54:35.450
divisors are equal to 1.,00:54:35.450,00:54:39.220
"So that means that there is
no common divisor between n",00:54:39.220,00:54:43.592
"and these, except 1 of course.",00:54:43.592,00:54:47.600
So what does this say?,00:54:47.600,00:54:49.320
"Well, this means that
this remainder, according",00:54:49.320,00:54:52.470
"to our definition, is
relatively prime to n,",00:54:52.470,00:54:55.830
"because this greatest common
divisor is equal to 1.",00:54:55.830,00:54:59.171
"So if it is an integer
relatively prime to n,",00:54:59.171,00:55:05.420
"then it must be one
of those k i's, k j's",00:55:05.420,00:55:08.460
"in this set that is
stated in the lemma.",00:55:08.460,00:55:11.820
"So this shows that it must be
part of this set over here.",00:55:11.820,00:55:16.290
"So if proven, the fact
[? is ?] that the set of all",00:55:16.290,00:55:20.160
"the remainders is a subset
of the set k 1 of the k r.",00:55:20.160,00:55:25.350
So now we're done.,00:55:25.350,00:55:28.260
"So now that we have shown
this particular lemma,",00:55:28.260,00:55:34.730
"we can continue and
prove Euler's theorem.",00:55:34.730,00:55:40.420
"And I'll probably need
to wipe out some of this.",00:55:40.420,00:55:43.460
"So let's use this lemma
to prove this theorem.",00:55:52.750,00:55:56.360
So this is really a neat trick.,00:55:56.360,00:55:57.920
"So the proof of Euler's
theorem is as follows.",00:56:02.350,00:56:09.510
"We're going to take the product
of all those k i's over there,",00:56:09.510,00:56:14.130
"and see where we can
find a nice relationship.",00:56:14.130,00:56:17.670
"So we take k 1 times k
2, all the way times k r.",00:56:17.670,00:56:23.540
"And we know, because those two
sets are actually the same,",00:56:23.540,00:56:27.290
"that this is equal
to the remainder--",00:56:27.290,00:56:30.310
"the first remainder--
k 1 times k,",00:56:30.310,00:56:37.230
"after dividing out as
many multiples of n.",00:56:37.230,00:56:39.520
"And we go all the way
up to the final one,",00:56:39.520,00:56:42.340
"the remainder of k r
times k, dividing out",00:56:42.340,00:56:47.980
as many multiples of n.,00:56:47.980,00:56:50.280
"So now we can see that--
well, we've already",00:56:50.280,00:56:55.800
"shown that each of
those remainders",00:56:55.800,00:56:59.480
"is congruent to, in
this case, this one",00:56:59.480,00:57:01.650
"is congruent to k
1 times k modulo n.",00:57:01.650,00:57:05.210
"And this one is congruent
to k r times k modulo n.",00:57:05.210,00:57:08.190
So let's write it out.,00:57:08.190,00:57:09.650
So it's k 1 times k.,00:57:09.650,00:57:12.430
And then we have k 2 times k.,00:57:12.430,00:57:16.140
"And finally we have
k r times k modulo n.",00:57:16.140,00:57:23.890
So let's regroup those.,00:57:23.890,00:57:26.910
"We see k 1, k 2, all the
way up to k r reappearing.",00:57:26.910,00:57:30.580
"And we have a k here,
a k here, and we",00:57:35.660,00:57:39.770
"have that r times--
so we have times",00:57:39.770,00:57:42.630
k to the power r modulo n.,00:57:42.630,00:57:47.990
"So now we are able to, again,
use this particular lemma",00:57:47.990,00:57:52.250
over here.,00:57:52.250,00:57:53.990
So what do we do?,00:57:53.990,00:57:55.560
"Well, we know that k 1
is relatively prime to n.",00:57:55.560,00:58:01.115
"And k 2 is as well,
all the way up to k r.",00:58:01.115,00:58:04.590
"So this whole product is also
relatively prime, with respect",00:58:04.590,00:58:08.450
to n.,00:58:08.450,00:58:09.979
"That means that the
greatest common divisor",00:58:09.979,00:58:11.770
"of this whole product
with n is equal to 1.",00:58:11.770,00:58:17.060
"So that means that I can
divide out this whole product.",00:58:17.060,00:58:21.920
We have-- so let's do this.,00:58:21.920,00:58:25.190
We have 1 times this product.,00:58:25.190,00:58:28.300
"We take this for a,
and we take this for b.",00:58:28.300,00:58:33.960
"And then we can divide
this whole thing out",00:58:33.960,00:58:38.770
"according to this
particular lemma,",00:58:38.770,00:58:40.600
"by using the multiplicative
inverse of that product.",00:58:40.600,00:58:44.760
"So now we see that the 1 is
equal to k to the power r",00:58:44.760,00:58:49.690
modulo n.,00:58:49.690,00:58:51.720
"And remember, in our
theorem, r over here",00:58:51.720,00:58:56.010
"in this lemma-- r is
actually equal to the Euler's",00:58:56.010,00:59:02.500
totient function in n.,00:59:02.500,00:59:04.740
"So now this equation
proves the whole theorem.",00:59:04.740,00:59:09.780
"OK, so now I'm going
to talk about RSA,",00:59:09.780,00:59:15.890
which is the last part here.,00:59:15.890,00:59:17.890
"So maybe you all
would like to have",00:59:17.890,00:59:20.080
"a little break of a couple of
minutes, just to relax a bit.",00:59:20.080,00:59:24.430
"And then-- and shake
hands with your neighbors,",00:59:24.430,00:59:26.540
"and jump up in the
air if you'd like to.",00:59:26.540,00:59:30.150
"All right let's start
with the RSA algorithm.",00:59:30.150,00:59:33.590
"So we have done everything
up to this point.",00:59:33.590,00:59:37.480
"And we are actually-- we have
done these two over here.",00:59:37.480,00:59:42.150
"We still have to talk about
Fermat's little theorem.",00:59:42.150,00:59:45.300
"But then we can go for RSA,
and it uses this consequence",00:59:45.300,00:59:48.990
of Euler's theorem.,00:59:48.990,00:59:52.470
"So Fermat's little
theorem is actually",00:59:52.470,01:00:04.130
"talking about what happens
if n is a prime number.",01:00:04.130,01:00:08.154
"It says, well,
suppose p is a prime.",01:00:11.640,01:00:14.340
"And if you have k in the
range 1, 2, all the way up",01:00:19.830,01:00:25.100
"to p minus 1, then we
can conclude that k",01:00:25.100,01:00:32.010
"to the power of p minus 1
is congruent to 1 modulo n.",01:00:32.010,01:00:37.770
"And we can directly prove
this by using Euler's theorem.",01:00:37.770,01:00:44.150
So how do we do this?,01:00:44.150,01:00:46.340
"Well, we know that p is prime.",01:00:46.340,01:00:49.300
"So the numbers 1, 2, all
the way up to p minus 1,",01:00:49.300,01:00:57.380
"are actually
relatively prime to p.",01:00:57.380,01:01:01.880
So why is that?,01:01:05.000,01:01:05.710
"Well, p is prime.",01:01:05.710,01:01:06.920
"So the greatest common divisor
between any of those with p",01:01:06.920,01:01:10.257
is equal to 1.,01:01:10.257,01:01:10.840
"That's the definition
of relatively prime.",01:01:10.840,01:01:14.640
"And we know that
we can now apply",01:01:14.640,01:01:21.070
"Euler's theorem
over here, and see",01:01:21.070,01:01:23.370
"that k to the power phi of
p is, of course, congruent",01:01:23.370,01:01:31.640
to 1 modulo p.,01:01:31.640,01:01:34.390
That's Euler's theorem.,01:01:34.390,01:01:36.430
"But now, since we know that
these are the exact ones that",01:01:36.430,01:01:39.510
"are relatively prime,
we can explicitly",01:01:39.510,01:01:42.930
"compute the Euler's
totient function of p.",01:01:42.930,01:01:46.290
"Because there are p
minus 1 numbers that",01:01:46.290,01:01:48.250
are relatively prime to p.,01:01:48.250,01:01:50.480
"So that's the
definition over here.",01:01:50.480,01:01:53.530
"So the number of integers in
the range 1 up to p minus 1--",01:01:53.530,01:01:57.870
they're all relatively prime.,01:01:57.870,01:02:00.040
"So we know that 5 p
is equal to p minus 1.",01:02:00.040,01:02:09.060
"So now we have shown that
k to the power of p minus 1",01:02:09.060,01:02:14.140
is congruent to 1 modulo k.,01:02:14.140,01:02:18.320
"This is kind of interesting
because we can use this theorem",01:02:18.320,01:02:22.260
"also to compute the
multiplicative inverse of k,",01:02:22.260,01:02:26.170
in this particular case.,01:02:26.170,01:02:27.830
So how do we do this?,01:02:27.830,01:02:31.430
"We just take k,
and we look at what",01:02:31.430,01:02:35.250
"happens if you multiply k with
k to the power of p minus 2.",01:02:35.250,01:02:41.690
"Well, this is equal to k to
the power p minus 1, which",01:02:41.690,01:02:46.340
"is congruent to 1 modulo p
according to Fermat's theorem.",01:02:46.340,01:02:56.047
"So now, when we look
at the definition",01:02:56.047,01:02:57.630
"of multiplicative
inverse over here,",01:02:57.630,01:03:01.220
"we see that k to
the power p minus 2",01:03:01.220,01:03:05.240
"is actually the
multiplicative inverse of k.",01:03:05.240,01:03:07.755
"So k inverse is actually
equal to k to the power",01:03:10.350,01:03:15.240
p minus 2 modulo k.,01:03:15.240,01:03:22.340
"All right, so this theorem
we're going to use now",01:03:22.340,01:03:25.180
in the description of RSA.,01:03:25.180,01:03:26.290
"As I said, it was only
decades later, after Turing,",01:03:29.850,01:03:36.440
"Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman
were the first to really show",01:03:36.440,01:03:40.480
"how number theory
could be applied so",01:03:40.480,01:03:42.430
successfully in cryptography.,01:03:42.430,01:03:44.900
"And they essentially showed
the first public key encryption",01:03:44.900,01:03:48.850
"scheme in which a sender and
receiver do not necessarily",01:03:48.850,01:03:52.130
have to exchange a secret key.,01:03:52.130,01:03:54.250
That's not necessary.,01:03:54.250,01:03:55.460
So they had a public key method.,01:03:55.460,01:03:59.140
"And that's still used today,
and it's a great inventions.",01:03:59.140,01:04:04.880
So how does the RSA work?,01:04:04.880,01:04:07.820
"Again, we have to talk
with an encryption scheme",01:04:07.820,01:04:10.300
about what happens beforehand.,01:04:10.300,01:04:12.830
"So beforehand, we need to
generate this public key",01:04:12.830,01:04:17.320
and a secret key.,01:04:17.320,01:04:19.660
"So the idea is that the receiver
creates a public key, and also",01:04:19.660,01:04:32.320
a secret key.,01:04:32.320,01:04:33.250
"He will publish the public
key, and he will keep",01:04:36.910,01:04:39.020
the secret key for himself.,01:04:39.020,01:04:40.760
"And now anybody can
use the public key",01:04:40.760,01:04:43.750
to encrypt a message.,01:04:43.750,01:04:46.680
"The encrypted message
is sent to the receiver,",01:04:46.680,01:04:49.690
"and he's going to use his
secret key to get back",01:04:49.690,01:04:52.930
to the plain message.,01:04:52.930,01:04:55.890
So how is he going to do this?,01:04:55.890,01:04:57.880
"Well in the first
step, the idea is",01:04:57.880,01:05:00.860
to generate two distinct primes.,01:05:00.860,01:05:05.730
"Turns out that this can be
done in a very efficient way.",01:05:05.730,01:05:10.190
"There are lots of primes
among the integers.",01:05:10.190,01:05:14.020
So you just sample.,01:05:14.020,01:05:15.710
"And it turns out that
you can test primality",01:05:15.710,01:05:21.150
"with a pretty high
probability, very efficiently.",01:05:21.150,01:05:23.756
"And recently,
actually, there has",01:05:23.756,01:05:25.130
"been a deterministic
algorithm that is polynomial.",01:05:25.130,01:05:29.094
"And a number of
bits of the primes",01:05:29.094,01:05:30.510
"that can actually tell you
whether you have a prime",01:05:30.510,01:05:33.710
or not.,01:05:33.710,01:05:34.220
So you can do this.,01:05:34.220,01:05:35.050
"Two, we're going to create
the product of these two",01:05:37.700,01:05:41.760
distinct primes.,01:05:41.760,01:05:42.790
"And that's where our
assumption is going to help us.",01:05:42.790,01:05:47.000
"That it is hard to factor a
product of two large primes.",01:05:47.000,01:05:51.470
"That's going to be the
underlying hardness assumption",01:05:51.470,01:05:54.740
of the RSA encryption scheme.,01:05:54.740,01:05:57.110
So let n be this.,01:05:59.660,01:06:02.840
"Three, we are going to
select an integer e,",01:06:02.840,01:06:11.790
"such that the greatest
common divisor of e",01:06:11.790,01:06:16.960
"with the product p
minus 1 times q minus 1",01:06:16.960,01:06:22.060
is actually equal to 1.,01:06:22.060,01:06:25.850
"And the public-- and once
we have created this,",01:06:25.850,01:06:30.470
"the public key is going
to be a pair that consists",01:06:30.470,01:06:40.270
of e itself together with n.,01:06:40.270,01:06:44.650
So that's the public key.,01:06:44.650,01:06:46.670
"And the secret key is going
to be computed as follows,",01:06:46.670,01:06:51.800
in step four.,01:06:51.800,01:06:54.315
We are going to compute.,01:06:54.315,01:06:55.315
"d, such that d times e
is congruent to 1 modulo",01:06:58.750,01:07:09.290
"that product of p minus
1 times q minus 1.",01:07:09.290,01:07:16.010
Can we do this?,01:07:16.010,01:07:17.260
"Yeah, because the greatest
common divisor between e",01:07:17.260,01:07:21.180
and that product is equal to 1.,01:07:21.180,01:07:23.860
"And we have shown over
here that, therefore, it",01:07:23.860,01:07:26.770
has a multiplicative inverse.,01:07:26.770,01:07:28.790
"And first of all, we know
that the solution d exists,",01:07:28.790,01:07:32.820
"and we can also
efficiently compute it.",01:07:32.820,01:07:36.070
"So the secret key is
going to be the pair that",01:07:36.070,01:07:48.030
consists of d and also n.,01:07:48.030,01:07:51.730
So how does it work?,01:07:51.730,01:07:53.530
"The sender knows the
public key, e and n,",01:07:53.530,01:07:58.720
"and uses those to
encrypt a message.",01:07:58.720,01:08:00.690
I will explain it in a moment.,01:08:00.690,01:08:02.340
"And then the receiver knows
the secret key, d and n,",01:08:02.340,01:08:07.510
and then is able to decrypt.,01:08:07.510,01:08:10.130
"OK, so let's see how
encryption works.",01:08:10.130,01:08:15.050
"And then we will have to
do a lot of mathematics",01:08:15.050,01:08:18.170
to get the decryption going.,01:08:18.170,01:08:21.060
"So m prime, which is computed--
so the encrypted plain text is",01:08:21.060,01:08:27.330
"computed as the remainder
of m to the power e--",01:08:27.330,01:08:31.410
"which is part of
the public key--",01:08:31.410,01:08:33.870
"and then dividing out as many
multiples of n as possible.",01:08:33.870,01:08:38.850
"It turns out-- and we are going
to prove this-- that decryption",01:08:38.850,01:08:43.859
works as follows.,01:08:43.859,01:08:46.720
"We can compute m
by using m prime.",01:08:46.720,01:08:50.760
So we receive m prime.,01:08:50.760,01:08:52.880
What do we do?,01:08:52.880,01:08:54.100
"We're going to take m prime,
raise it to the power d-- which",01:08:54.100,01:08:58.000
"is part of the secret
key-- and then dividing out",01:08:58.000,01:09:01.710
as many multiples of n.,01:09:01.710,01:09:04.890
"Now, why would that work?",01:09:04.890,01:09:08.200
Why would this work?,01:09:08.200,01:09:09.240
"So let's prove this
step over here.",01:09:09.240,01:09:12.979
"Well, it turns out that they
can apply Fermat's theorem,",01:09:15.590,01:09:20.439
and the idea is as follows.,01:09:20.439,01:09:23.430
So let's have a look.,01:09:23.430,01:09:24.790
"We know that m prime is equal
to the remainder of m raised",01:09:24.790,01:09:31.100
"to the power e, which
is congruent to m",01:09:31.100,01:09:35.450
"to the power e, modulo n.",01:09:35.450,01:09:39.029
"We've seen this now a
number of times, right?",01:09:39.029,01:09:42.200
So what does this imply?,01:09:42.200,01:09:45.310
"This implies that m prime to
the power d is actually equal--",01:09:45.310,01:09:52.939
"is congruent to m to the
power e, to the power d.",01:09:52.939,01:09:57.900
"So I just raised this
side to the power d,",01:09:57.900,01:10:00.390
"and I raised this
side to the power d.",01:10:00.390,01:10:03.030
"And I still-- and
I know, now, that m",01:10:03.030,01:10:08.390
"prime to the power d is
equal to m to the power e d--",01:10:08.390,01:10:11.540
"congruent to m to the
power e d modulo n.",01:10:11.540,01:10:15.420
"So now we know that there
exists an integer r.",01:10:15.420,01:10:19.970
"We are going to use the
fact that we have that e",01:10:19.970,01:10:23.450
"and p minus 1 times q
minus 1 as a greatest",01:10:23.450,01:10:26.280
common divisor over 1.,01:10:26.280,01:10:28.020
"So we know that e times
d is actually equal to 1,",01:10:28.020,01:10:35.290
"plus r times p minus
1, times q minus 1.",01:10:35.290,01:10:40.320
"Actually, what I use here is
the fact-- is this over here.",01:10:40.320,01:10:46.310
"By definition of
congruency, I know",01:10:46.310,01:10:48.710
"that the difference
between those two-- d times",01:10:48.710,01:10:51.390
"e and 1-- is divisible
by this product.",01:10:51.390,01:10:55.430
"So I know that there
exists an integer such",01:10:55.430,01:10:57.590
"that e times d equals 1, plus
a multiple of that product.",01:10:57.590,01:11:02.070
That's how it works.,01:11:02.070,01:11:04.860
"So we know that m
prime to the power",01:11:04.860,01:11:08.800
"d-- we already saw that it is
equal to m to the power e d,",01:11:08.800,01:11:14.670
"which is congruent
to-- well, we just",01:11:14.670,01:11:17.410
"replace e d by 1 plus
r times this multiple.",01:11:17.410,01:11:20.960
"So we have m to the
power 1, times m",01:11:20.960,01:11:25.220
"to the power-- this part--
r p minus 1, q minus 1.",01:11:25.220,01:11:31.026
"So now we're finally going
get to Fermat's theorem.",01:11:35.220,01:11:45.450
"We know that n is the
products of p and q,",01:11:45.450,01:11:48.820
"and I'm not actually
sure I do this here.",01:11:48.820,01:11:52.260
"So let's apply Fermat's theorem
and see how we can use this.",01:11:55.130,01:12:00.870
"So if m is not
congruent to 0 modulo p,",01:12:00.870,01:12:08.320
"well then we can apply
Fermat's theorem.",01:12:08.320,01:12:11.580
Where is it?,01:12:11.580,01:12:12.080
It's over here.,01:12:12.080,01:12:14.480
"We can only apply this if
k is in the range from 1",01:12:14.480,01:12:18.830
"to p minus 1 is
not equal to zero.",01:12:18.830,01:12:21.640
"So if m is not equal to 0--
not congruent to 0 modulo p--",01:12:21.640,01:12:27.020
"then we can apply
the theorem and state",01:12:27.020,01:12:30.700
"that m to the power p minus
1 is congruent to 1 modulo p.",01:12:30.700,01:12:37.960
"And in the same way,
we can do this for q.",01:12:37.960,01:12:42.440
"So if this is not
true-- modulo q-- then m",01:12:42.440,01:12:48.880
"to the power q minus 1 is
congruent to 1 modulo q.",01:12:48.880,01:12:54.120
"So here we have used
Fermat's theorem twice.",01:12:54.120,01:12:56.840
"Now we can apply what
we have learned before,",01:12:59.890,01:13:04.330
"which is what we
wrote down over here.",01:13:04.330,01:13:07.990
"And prime to the power d is
congruent to this modulo n.",01:13:07.990,01:13:13.110
"Now n is p times q, so let's
have a look at what that means.",01:13:13.110,01:13:17.890
"It means that since n
is a product of p and q,",01:13:17.890,01:13:23.140
"we can also look at
this congruent modulo p.",01:13:23.140,01:13:27.730
"So in particular, we know
that m prime to the power",01:13:27.730,01:13:32.170
"d is congruent to m times
m r p minus 1 times q minus",01:13:32.170,01:13:39.190
1 modulo p.,01:13:39.190,01:13:42.280
Why is that?,01:13:42.280,01:13:43.540
"Well, we know that n
divides this difference",01:13:43.540,01:13:46.670
by the definition of congruency.,01:13:46.670,01:13:49.270
n is equal to p times q.,01:13:49.270,01:13:52.450
"So if n is dividing
this difference,",01:13:52.450,01:13:56.270
"also p is dividing
this difference.",01:13:56.270,01:13:58.770
"So that's why we can write
it m prime to the power d",01:13:58.770,01:14:01.140
"is congruent to this
thing, modulo p.",01:14:01.140,01:14:05.380
"And of course, we can
repeat this for q.",01:14:05.380,01:14:08.560
"So let me write
this out as well.",01:14:11.100,01:14:12.940
So there it is.,01:14:17.930,01:14:18.890
"So now we can there use what
we have figured out over here.",01:14:21.600,01:14:28.400
"So we know that if
m is not equal to 0,",01:14:28.400,01:14:33.560
"then this thing over
here cancels out.",01:14:33.560,01:14:38.180
"Because m to the power p
minus 1 is congruent to 1.",01:14:38.180,01:14:43.000
"So we have that m
prime to the power",01:14:43.000,01:14:47.690
"d is congruent to m
modulo p, if m is not",01:14:47.690,01:14:55.490
"congruent to 0 modulo p, right?",01:14:55.490,01:14:57.460
"Because if m is not
congruent to zero,",01:14:57.460,01:14:59.550
"we have this
particular equation.",01:14:59.550,01:15:01.150
"We plug it in over
here, this all cancels,",01:15:01.150,01:15:04.100
and we just are left with m.,01:15:04.100,01:15:06.840
"Now, if m is equal-- is
congruent-- to 0 modulo p,",01:15:06.840,01:15:12.080
"then we can see that
it is equal to 0.",01:15:12.080,01:15:16.050
So it's equal to 0.,01:15:16.050,01:15:18.210
"So this actually
holds for any case.",01:15:18.210,01:15:21.600
"Now we can do the same for
q-- the same argument--",01:15:21.600,01:15:27.680
and show that this must hold.,01:15:27.680,01:15:30.680
"So now we know that p
divides the difference",01:15:30.680,01:15:35.110
of m prime d minus m.,01:15:35.110,01:15:38.225
"q is another prime that
divides this difference.",01:15:38.225,01:15:43.190
"And the only way that's possible
is if the product of p and q",01:15:43.190,01:15:49.280
"is dividing this particular
number-- this difference.",01:15:49.280,01:15:55.130
"And we have two different
primes dividing the same number,",01:15:55.130,01:15:58.230
"so the product
must [? divided. ?]",01:15:58.230,01:16:00.290
"So p times q divides
m prime d minus m.",01:16:00.290,01:16:08.770
"Oh, but p times q is equal to n.",01:16:08.770,01:16:12.040
"So now we're almost
done, because now we",01:16:12.040,01:16:14.230
"can state-- by the
definition of congruency--",01:16:14.230,01:16:18.010
"that m prime to the power d
is congruent to m modulo n.",01:16:18.010,01:16:26.350
"Now, since m is a message that's
in the range of-- so I did not",01:16:26.350,01:16:32.200
"write it down here--
so m is a message",01:16:32.200,01:16:35.030
"which is in the range of 0
all the way up to n minus 1.",01:16:35.030,01:16:40.440
"We know, and we have seen it
before with Turing's code,",01:16:40.440,01:16:43.440
"that we can rewrite this
and say that m equals",01:16:43.440,01:16:47.200
"the remainder of m
prime to the power",01:16:47.200,01:16:50.960
"d, after multiplying out as
many multiples of n as possible.",01:16:50.960,01:16:57.100
So here you go.,01:16:57.100,01:16:58.060
"So this is the decryption
rule, and it works.",01:16:58.060,01:17:02.180
"We have shown that this
equation truly holds.",01:17:02.180,01:17:06.640
"So RSA has really
withstood the test of time.",01:17:06.640,01:17:10.250
"It's already out there
for many decades,",01:17:10.250,01:17:13.250
and it's still widely used.,01:17:13.250,01:17:15.322
"I wanted to talk a
little bit about this,",01:17:15.322,01:17:17.030
"but there seemed not
to be enough time.",01:17:17.030,01:17:19.580
"But I'd just like to mention
that only 2009 Craig Gentry",01:17:19.580,01:17:26.570
"proved a beautiful theorem,
and was able to evaluate",01:17:26.570,01:17:32.250
Boolean circuits.,01:17:32.250,01:17:33.250
"Or, say, certain types of
programs under encryption.",01:17:33.250,01:17:37.650
"So you can sort of add
and multiply cypher text",01:17:37.650,01:17:41.040
"encryptions together, and it
is as if you multiply them",01:17:41.040,01:17:45.310
at the plain text level.,01:17:45.310,01:17:46.700
"That was a fantastic-- that
was an enormous open problem.",01:17:46.700,01:17:50.720
And he solved it.,01:17:50.720,01:17:52.030
"And only a few months
earlier, in 2010,",01:17:52.030,01:17:55.850
"in joint work with Craig and
some other colleagues at IBM,",01:17:55.850,01:17:59.810
"we showed it with
very simple arithmetic",01:17:59.810,01:18:02.570
"that just uses modulo p and
modulo 2 kind of things.",01:18:02.570,01:18:07.120
"We could show a
construction this",01:18:07.120,01:18:11.450
"has such a property--
such an encryption",01:18:11.450,01:18:13.490
scheme of the integers.,01:18:13.490,01:18:15.100
"So there's still a lot of
stuff going on in this area.",01:18:15.100,01:18:18.130
"And really, we use this
type of very basic stuff.",01:18:18.130,01:18:21.780
"The problem in cryptography
is to show that it is secure.",01:18:21.780,01:18:25.450
"So you have to show
that breaking the scheme",01:18:25.450,01:18:28.330
"needs to be reduced to
some really hard problem.",01:18:28.330,01:18:32.190
"And that is always the
really difficult part",01:18:32.190,01:18:34.920
of such type of research.,01:18:34.920,01:18:37.200
"OK, well, have lots of
fun with recitation.",01:18:37.200,01:18:40.950
