"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: We're
talking about tests.",00:00:19.535,00:00:21.410
"And to be fair, we
spend most of our time",00:00:21.410,00:00:24.720
"talking about new
jargon that we're using.",00:00:24.720,00:00:28.470
"The main goal is to take a
binary decision, yes and no.",00:00:28.470,00:00:31.710
"So just so that we're clear
and we make sure that we all",00:00:31.710,00:00:36.360
"speak the same
language, let me just",00:00:36.360,00:00:37.980
"remind you what the key
words are for tests.",00:00:37.980,00:00:42.570
"So the first thing is
that we split theta",00:00:42.570,00:00:48.310
in theta 0 and theta 1.,00:00:48.310,00:00:53.690
"Both are included in theta,
and they are disjoint.",00:00:53.690,00:00:57.610
"So I have my set of
possible parameters.",00:01:00.970,00:01:04.090
"And then I have theta 0
is here, theta 1 is here.",00:01:04.090,00:01:10.770
"And there might be
something that I leave out.",00:01:10.770,00:01:14.170
"And so what we're doing
is, we have two hypotheses.",00:01:14.170,00:01:18.070
"So here's our hypothesis
testing problem.",00:01:18.070,00:01:20.800
"And it's h0 theta belongs
to theta 0 versus h1 theta",00:01:20.800,00:01:27.910
belongs to theta 1.,00:01:27.910,00:01:29.860
"This guy was called
the null, and this guy",00:01:29.860,00:01:32.620
was called the alternative.,00:01:32.620,00:01:36.410
"And why we give
them special names",00:01:36.410,00:01:37.910
"is because we saw that they
have an asymmetric role.",00:01:37.910,00:01:41.230
"The null represents
the status quo,",00:01:41.230,00:01:43.070
"and data is here to bring
evidence against this guy.",00:01:43.070,00:01:46.290
"And we can really never
conclude that h0 is true",00:01:46.290,00:01:49.730
"because all we could conclude is
that h1 is not true, or may not",00:01:49.730,00:01:56.420
be true.,00:01:56.420,00:01:59.030
So that was the first thing.,00:01:59.030,00:02:00.840
"The second thing
was the hypothesis.",00:02:00.840,00:02:03.020
"The third thing
is, what is a test?",00:02:03.020,00:02:05.730
"Well, psi, it's a statistic,
and it takes the data,",00:02:05.730,00:02:17.100
and it maps it into 0 or 1.,00:02:17.100,00:02:21.500
"And I didn't really mention it,
but there's some things such",00:02:21.500,00:02:24.000
"as called randomized
tests, which is, well,",00:02:24.000,00:02:27.390
"if I cannot really
make a decision,",00:02:27.390,00:02:28.920
I might as well flip a coin.,00:02:28.920,00:02:30.870
"That tends to be biased,
but that's really--",00:02:30.870,00:02:32.952
"I mean, think about
it in practice.",00:02:32.952,00:02:34.410
"You probably don't
want to make decisions",00:02:34.410,00:02:36.118
based on flipping a coin.,00:02:36.118,00:02:37.380
"And so what people
typically do--",00:02:37.380,00:02:39.270
"this is happening, typically,
at one specific value.",00:02:39.270,00:02:41.830
"So rather than flipping a coin
for this very specific value,",00:02:41.830,00:02:44.339
"what people typically
do is they say,",00:02:44.339,00:02:45.880
"OK, I'm going to side with
h0 because that's the most",00:02:45.880,00:02:48.088
conservative choice I can make.,00:02:48.088,00:02:50.134
"So in a way, they think
of flipping this coin,",00:02:50.134,00:02:52.050
"but always falling
on heads, say.",00:02:52.050,00:02:55.380
"So associated to this test
was something called, well,",00:02:55.380,00:02:58.410
"the rejection
region r psi, which",00:02:58.410,00:03:05.590
"is just the set of data x1
xn such that psi of x1 xn",00:03:05.590,00:03:15.360
is equal to 1.,00:03:15.360,00:03:16.720
"So that means we rejected
h0 when the test is 1.",00:03:16.720,00:03:19.170
"And those are the
set of data points",00:03:19.170,00:03:21.270
"that actually are going to
lead me to reject the test.",00:03:21.270,00:03:25.140
"And then the things that
we're actually, slightly,",00:03:28.777,00:03:30.860
"a little more important and
really peculiar to test,",00:03:30.860,00:03:35.660
"specific to tests, were the
type I and type II error.",00:03:35.660,00:03:40.460
"So the type I
error arises when--",00:03:40.460,00:03:44.820
"so type I error is when you
reject, whereas h0 is correct.",00:03:44.820,00:04:01.390
"And the type II error
is the opposite,",00:04:01.390,00:04:06.920
"so it's failed to reject,
whereas h1 is correct--",00:04:06.920,00:04:17.354
"h is correct, yeah.",00:04:17.354,00:04:20.450
"So those are the two types
of errors you can make.",00:04:20.450,00:04:23.770
"And we quantified their
probability of type I error.",00:04:23.770,00:04:26.820
"So alpha psi is
the probability--",00:04:26.820,00:04:31.720
"so that's the probability
of type I error.",00:04:31.720,00:04:38.320
"So psi is just the probability
for theta that psi rejects",00:04:41.470,00:04:49.190
"and that's defined
for theta and theta 0,",00:04:49.190,00:04:54.360
"so for different
values of theta 0.",00:04:54.360,00:04:56.390
"So h0 being correct means
there exists a theta in theta 0",00:04:56.390,00:05:00.380
"for which that actually
is the right distribution.",00:05:00.380,00:05:03.380
"So for different
values of theta,",00:05:03.380,00:05:05.060
I might make different errors.,00:05:05.060,00:05:07.340
"So if you think, for example,
about the coin example,",00:05:07.340,00:05:12.440
"I'm testing if the coin
is biased towards heads",00:05:12.440,00:05:16.550
or biased towards tails.,00:05:16.550,00:05:18.770
"So if I'm testing
whether p is larger",00:05:18.770,00:05:21.830
"than 1/2 or less than 1/2,
then when the true p-- let's",00:05:21.830,00:05:25.145
say our h0 is larger than 1/2.,00:05:25.145,00:05:27.290
"When p is equal to 1, it's
actually very difficult for me",00:05:27.290,00:05:29.900
"to make a mistake,
because I only see heads.",00:05:29.900,00:05:33.570
"So when p is getting
closer to 1/2,",00:05:33.570,00:05:35.780
"I'm going to start making more
and more probability of error.",00:05:35.780,00:05:38.850
"And so the type II error-- so
that's the probability of type",00:05:38.850,00:05:42.170
II--,00:05:42.170,00:05:43.670
is denoted by beta psi.,00:05:43.670,00:05:46.550
"And it's the function,
well, that does the opposite",00:05:46.550,00:05:50.750
"and, this time, is defined
for theta in theta 1.",00:05:50.750,00:05:58.070
"And finally, we define something
called the power, pi of psi.",00:05:58.070,00:06:13.410
"And this time, this
is actually a number.",00:06:13.410,00:06:16.180
"And so this number is equal to
the maximum over theta n theta",00:06:16.180,00:06:23.220
0.,00:06:23.220,00:06:23.879
"I mean, that could be a
supremum, but think of it",00:06:23.879,00:06:25.920
"as being a maximum of p
theta of psi is equal--",00:06:25.920,00:06:32.940
"sorry, that's n0, right?",00:06:32.940,00:06:37.580
Give me one sec.,00:06:37.580,00:06:39.640
"No, sorry, that's the min.",00:06:39.640,00:06:42.270
So this is not making a mistake.,00:06:46.190,00:06:48.740
"Theta 0 is in theta 2 So
if theta is in theta 1",00:06:48.740,00:06:52.940
"and I conclude 1, so
this is a good thing.",00:06:52.940,00:06:55.279
I want this number to be large.,00:06:55.279,00:06:56.570
"And I'm looking at
the worst house--",00:06:56.570,00:06:58.860
"what is the smallest
value this number can be?",00:06:58.860,00:07:02.770
"So what I want to show you
a little bit is a picture.",00:07:02.770,00:07:06.040
"So now I'm going to take theta,
and think of it as being a p.",00:07:09.410,00:07:12.770
"So I'm going to take p for some
variable in the experiment.",00:07:12.770,00:07:18.340
"So p can range between 0
and 1, that's for sure.",00:07:18.340,00:07:20.690
"And what I'm going
to try to test",00:07:23.516,00:07:24.890
"is whether p is less than
1/2 or larger than 1/2.",00:07:24.890,00:07:30.200
"So this is going to
be, let's say, theta 0.",00:07:30.200,00:07:34.340
And this guy here is theta 1.,00:07:34.340,00:07:37.020
"Just trying to give you a
picture of what those guys are.",00:07:37.020,00:07:40.900
"So I have my y-axis, and now I'm
going to start drawing number.",00:07:40.900,00:07:46.240
"All these things--
this function,",00:07:46.240,00:07:48.760
"this function, and
this number-- are",00:07:48.760,00:07:51.250
all numbers between 0 and 1.,00:07:51.250,00:07:52.600
So now I'm claiming that--,00:07:56.990,00:07:59.750
"so when I move
from left to right,",00:07:59.750,00:08:03.350
"what is my probability
of rejecting going to do?",00:08:03.350,00:08:08.430
"So what I'm going to plot is
the probability under theta.",00:08:08.430,00:08:11.930
"The first thing I want to plot
is the probability under theta",00:08:11.930,00:08:14.740
that psi is equal to 1.,00:08:14.740,00:08:19.400
And let's say psi--,00:08:19.400,00:08:20.880
"think of psi as being
just this indicator",00:08:20.880,00:08:25.140
"that square root on n xn bar
minus p over square root xn",00:08:25.140,00:08:35.270
"bar 1 minus xn bar is
larger than some constant c",00:08:35.270,00:08:40.419
for a probability chosen c.,00:08:40.419,00:08:43.840
"So what we choose is that c
is in such a way that, at 1/2,",00:08:43.840,00:08:48.280
"when we're testing
for 1/2, what we",00:08:48.280,00:08:50.380
"wanted was this number to be
equal to alpha, basically.",00:08:50.380,00:08:56.500
"So we fix this alpha
number so that this guy--",00:08:56.500,00:09:00.115
"so if I want alpha of psi
of theta less than alpha",00:09:00.115,00:09:09.430
given in advanced--,00:09:09.430,00:09:12.360
"so think of it as being
equal to, say, 5%.",00:09:12.360,00:09:15.199
"So I'm fixing this
number, and I want",00:09:15.199,00:09:16.740
"this to be controlled for
all theta and theta 0.",00:09:16.740,00:09:19.050
"So if you're going to
give me this budget,",00:09:23.400,00:09:26.440
"well, I'm actually going to
make it equal where I can.",00:09:26.440,00:09:29.644
"If you're telling me you
can make it equal to alpha,",00:09:29.644,00:09:31.810
"we know that if I
increase my type I error,",00:09:31.810,00:09:34.650
"I'm going to decrease
my type II error.",00:09:34.650,00:09:36.590
"If I start putting
everyone in jail",00:09:36.590,00:09:39.280
"or if I start letting
everyone go free,",00:09:39.280,00:09:41.862
"that's what we were
discussing last time.",00:09:41.862,00:09:43.570
"So since we have this
trade-off and you're",00:09:43.570,00:09:45.460
"giving me a budget for one guy,
I'm just going to max it out.",00:09:45.460,00:09:49.372
"And where am I
going to max it out?",00:09:49.372,00:09:50.830
Exactly at 1/2 at the boundary.,00:09:50.830,00:09:53.170
So this is going to be 5%.,00:09:53.170,00:09:54.400
"So what I know is that
since alpha of theta",00:10:00.970,00:10:03.460
"is less than alpha
for all theta in theta",00:10:03.460,00:10:06.550
"0-- sorry, that's for theta 0,
that's where alpha is defined.",00:10:06.550,00:10:12.580
"So for theta and theta 0,
I knew that my function",00:10:12.580,00:10:14.676
is going to look like this.,00:10:14.676,00:10:15.800
"It's going to be somewhere
in this rectangle.",00:10:15.800,00:10:18.380
Everybody agrees?,00:10:18.380,00:10:20.426
"So this function for this guy
is going to look like this.",00:10:20.426,00:10:22.800
"When I'm at 0, when
p is equal to 0,",00:10:22.800,00:10:25.590
"which means I only
observe 0's, then I",00:10:25.590,00:10:29.620
"know that p is going to be
0, and I will certainly not",00:10:29.620,00:10:32.350
conclude that p is equal to 1.,00:10:32.350,00:10:34.510
"This test will never conclude
that p is equal to 1--",00:10:34.510,00:10:39.100
"that p is larger than
1/2, just because xn bar",00:10:42.630,00:10:44.770
is going to be equal to 0.,00:10:44.770,00:10:46.120
"Well, this is actually
not well-defined,",00:10:46.120,00:10:48.190
"so maybe I need to do
something-- put it equal to 0",00:10:48.190,00:10:51.040
if xn bar is equal to 0.,00:10:51.040,00:10:52.900
"So I guess, basically, I get
something which is negative,",00:10:52.900,00:10:55.871
"and so it's never going to
be larger than what I want.",00:10:55.871,00:10:58.120
"And so here, I'm
actually starting at 0.",00:10:58.120,00:11:00.370
"So now, this is this function
here that increases--",00:11:00.370,00:11:04.300
"I mean, it should
increase smoothly.",00:11:04.300,00:11:06.610
"This function here is
alpha psi of theta--",00:11:06.610,00:11:11.620
"or alpha psi of p, let's say,
because we're talking about p.",00:11:11.620,00:11:15.280
Then it reaches alpha here.,00:11:15.280,00:11:17.916
"Now, when I go on
the other side,",00:11:17.916,00:11:19.290
I'm actually looking at beta.,00:11:19.290,00:11:21.510
"When I'm on theta 1, the
function that matters",00:11:21.510,00:11:23.730
"is the probability of type II
error, which is beta of psi.",00:11:23.730,00:11:28.540
"And this beta of psi is
actually going to increase.",00:11:28.540,00:11:30.775
So beta of psi is what?,00:11:34.130,00:11:35.500
"Well, beta of psi should also--",00:11:35.500,00:11:37.660
"sorry, that's the probability
of being equal to alpha.",00:11:37.660,00:11:39.940
"So what I'm going
to do is I'm going",00:11:39.940,00:11:41.440
"to look at the
probability of rejecting.",00:11:41.440,00:11:43.960
"So let me draw this
functional all the way.",00:11:43.960,00:11:46.502
It's going to look like this.,00:11:46.502,00:11:48.900
"Now here, if I look at
this function here or here,",00:11:48.900,00:11:52.750
"this is the probability under
theta that psi is equal to 1.",00:11:52.750,00:11:57.320
"And we just said
that, in this region,",00:11:57.320,00:11:59.620
"this function is
called alpha of psi.",00:11:59.620,00:12:02.600
"In that region, it's
not called alpha of psi.",00:12:02.600,00:12:06.990
It's not called anything.,00:12:06.990,00:12:08.340
"It's just the
probability of rejection.",00:12:08.340,00:12:11.030
"So it's not any
error, it's actually",00:12:11.030,00:12:12.770
what you should be doing.,00:12:12.770,00:12:14.310
"What we're looking at in this
region is 1 minus this guy.",00:12:14.310,00:12:19.680
"We're looking at the
probability of not rejecting.",00:12:19.680,00:12:21.780
"So I need to actually,
basically, look at the 1",00:12:21.780,00:12:23.820
"minus this thing, which
here is going to be 95%.",00:12:23.820,00:12:27.340
So I'm going to do 95%.,00:12:27.340,00:12:31.800
And this is my probability.,00:12:34.510,00:12:36.640
"Ability And I'm just
basically drawing",00:12:36.640,00:12:38.380
the symmetric of this guy.,00:12:38.380,00:12:40.330
"So this here is the
probability under theta",00:12:40.330,00:12:44.890
"that psi is equal to 0,
which is 1 minus p theta",00:12:44.890,00:12:50.390
that psi is equal to 1.,00:12:50.390,00:12:52.360
"So it's just 1 minus
the wide curve.",00:12:52.360,00:12:56.460
"And it's actually,
by definition, equal",00:12:56.460,00:12:59.010
to beta of psi of theta.,00:12:59.010,00:13:00.360
"Now, where do I read pi psi?",00:13:06.670,00:13:09.360
What is pi psi on this picture?,00:13:20.330,00:13:22.250
"Is pi psi a number
or a function?",00:13:26.130,00:13:28.020
AUDIENCE: Number.,00:13:32.242,00:13:32.950
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
It's a number, right?",00:13:32.950,00:13:33.670
It's the minimum of a function.,00:13:33.670,00:13:35.444
What is this function?,00:13:35.444,00:13:36.360
"It's the probability under
theta that theta is equal to 1.",00:13:36.360,00:13:39.450
"I drew this entire function for
between theta 0 and theta 1.",00:13:39.450,00:13:44.070
"I drew-- this is this
entire white curve.",00:13:44.070,00:13:46.680
This is this probability.,00:13:46.680,00:13:48.152
"Now I'm saying, look at the
smallest value this probability",00:13:48.152,00:13:50.610
can take on the set theta 1.,00:13:50.610,00:13:54.300
What is this?,00:13:54.300,00:13:55.060
This guy.,00:14:00.332,00:14:02.060
This is where my pi--,00:14:02.060,00:14:03.800
"this thing here is pi psi,
and so it's equal to 5%.",00:14:03.800,00:14:08.750
"So that's for this
particular test,",00:14:11.462,00:14:13.510
"because this test has a
continuous curve for this psi.",00:14:13.510,00:14:19.035
"And so if I want to
make sure that I'm",00:14:19.035,00:14:20.800
"at 5% when I come to the
right of the theta 0,",00:14:20.800,00:14:24.310
"if it touches theta
1, then I'd better",00:14:24.310,00:14:26.380
"have 5% on the other side if
the function is continuous.",00:14:26.380,00:14:30.220
"So basically, if
this function is",00:14:30.220,00:14:33.130
"increasing, which will be
the case for most tests,",00:14:33.130,00:14:38.189
"and continuous, then
what's going to happen",00:14:38.189,00:14:39.980
"is that the level of the
test, which is alpha,",00:14:39.980,00:14:42.499
"is actually going to be equal
to the power of the test.",00:14:42.499,00:14:44.790
"Now, there's something
I didn't mention,",00:14:48.260,00:14:50.110
"and I'm just mentioning
it passing by.",00:14:50.110,00:14:52.810
"Here, I define the power itself.",00:14:52.810,00:14:55.760
"This function, this
entire white curve here,",00:14:55.760,00:14:59.420
"is actually called
the power function--",00:14:59.420,00:15:01.510
this thing.,00:15:06.690,00:15:07.200
That's the entire white curve.,00:15:07.200,00:15:09.340
"And what you could
have is tests that",00:15:09.340,00:15:12.200
"have the entire curve which
is dominated by another test.",00:15:12.200,00:15:16.670
"So here, if I look
at this test--",00:15:16.670,00:15:18.760
"and let's assume I can
build another test that",00:15:18.760,00:15:21.680
has this curve.,00:15:21.680,00:15:23.070
"Let's say it's the same
here, but then here, it",00:15:23.070,00:15:29.024
looks like this.,00:15:29.024,00:15:29.690
What is the power of this test?,00:15:34.600,00:15:38.130
AUDIENCE: It's the same.,00:15:38.130,00:15:39.130
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
It's the same.",00:15:39.130,00:15:40.505
"It's 5%, because this
point touches here exactly",00:15:40.505,00:15:43.330
at the same point.,00:15:43.330,00:15:44.530
"However, for any other value
than the worst possible,",00:15:44.530,00:15:48.970
"this guy is doing
better than this guy.",00:15:48.970,00:15:51.670
Can you see that?,00:15:51.670,00:15:52.750
"Having a curve higher
on the right-hand side",00:15:52.750,00:15:55.420
"is a good thing because
it means that you",00:15:55.420,00:15:57.310
"tend to reject more when
you're actually in h1.",00:15:57.310,00:16:03.240
"So this guy is definitely
better than this guy.",00:16:03.240,00:16:06.516
"And so what we
say, in this case,",00:16:06.516,00:16:07.890
"is that the test
with the dashed line",00:16:07.890,00:16:09.660
"is uniformly more powerful
than the other tests.",00:16:09.660,00:16:13.550
"But we're not going to
go into those details",00:16:13.550,00:16:15.390
"because, basically, all the
tests that we will describe",00:16:15.390,00:16:18.780
"are already the
most powerful ones.",00:16:18.780,00:16:22.010
"In particular, this guy is--",00:16:22.010,00:16:24.090
there's no such thing.,00:16:24.090,00:16:25.020
"All the other guys
you can come up with",00:16:25.020,00:16:26.340
are going to actually be below.,00:16:26.340,00:16:27.631
"So we saw a couple
tests, then we",00:16:33.910,00:16:36.610
"saw how to pick this threshold,
and we defined those two",00:16:36.610,00:16:40.450
things.,00:16:40.450,00:16:41.327
AUDIENCE: Question.,00:16:41.327,00:16:42.118
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yes?,00:16:42.118,00:16:43.076
"AUDIENCE: But in that
case, the dashed line,",00:16:43.076,00:16:45.541
"if it were also higher
in the region of theta 0,",00:16:45.541,00:16:48.964
do you still consider it better?,00:16:48.964,00:16:50.898
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.,00:16:50.898,00:16:51.898
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:16:51.898,00:16:52.890
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Because
you're given this budget of 5%.",00:16:52.890,00:16:55.400
"So in this paradigm
where you're given the--",00:16:55.400,00:16:58.170
"actually, if the dashed
line was this dashed line,",00:16:58.170,00:17:01.450
I would still be happy.,00:17:01.450,00:17:03.030
"I mean, I don't care what
this thing does here,",00:17:03.030,00:17:05.040
as long as it's below 5%.,00:17:05.040,00:17:06.780
"But here, I'm going
to try to discover.",00:17:06.780,00:17:08.730
"Think about, again, the
drug discovery example.",00:17:08.730,00:17:11.460
"You're trying to find--
let's say you're a scientist",00:17:11.460,00:17:14.069
"and you're trying to prove
that your drug works.",00:17:14.069,00:17:17.140
What do you want to see?,00:17:17.140,00:17:18.140
"Well, FDA puts on
you this constraint",00:17:18.140,00:17:22.450
"that your probability of type
I error should never exceed 5%.",00:17:22.450,00:17:26.919
"You're going to work
under this assumption.",00:17:26.919,00:17:28.710
"But what you're going
to do is, you're",00:17:28.710,00:17:30.293
"going to try to find a test that
will make you find something",00:17:30.293,00:17:33.720
as often as possible.,00:17:33.720,00:17:35.450
"And so you're going to
max this constraint of 5%.",00:17:35.450,00:17:38.400
"And then you're going to try to
make this curve, that means--",00:17:38.400,00:17:41.820
"this is, basically, this
number here, for any point",00:17:41.820,00:17:45.780
"here, is the probability
that you publish your paper.",00:17:45.780,00:17:47.990
"That's the probability
that you can",00:17:47.990,00:17:50.460
release to market your drug.,00:17:50.460,00:17:51.690
"That's the probability
that it works.",00:17:51.690,00:17:53.710
"And so you want this curve
to be as high as possible.",00:17:53.710,00:17:56.920
"You want to make sure that if
there's evidence in the data",00:17:56.920,00:18:02.550
"that h1 is the truth, you
want to squeeze as much",00:18:02.550,00:18:05.670
of this evidence as possible.,00:18:05.670,00:18:07.110
"And the test that has the
highest possible curve",00:18:07.110,00:18:09.780
is the most powerful one.,00:18:09.780,00:18:11.490
"Now, you have to also understand
that having two curves that",00:18:11.490,00:18:15.810
"are on top of each other
completely, everywhere,",00:18:15.810,00:18:19.190
is a rare phenomenon.,00:18:19.190,00:18:22.560
"It's not always
the case that there",00:18:22.560,00:18:24.450
"is a test that's uniformly more
powerful than any other test.",00:18:24.450,00:18:27.842
"It might be that you
have some trade-off,",00:18:27.842,00:18:29.550
"that it might be better
here, but then you're",00:18:29.550,00:18:31.110
losing power here.,00:18:31.110,00:18:32.027
"Maybe it's-- I mean,
things like this.",00:18:32.027,00:18:33.610
"Well, actually, maybe
it should not go down.",00:18:33.610,00:18:35.110
"But let's say it goes like
this, and then, maybe, this guy",00:18:35.110,00:18:37.590
goes like this.,00:18:37.590,00:18:39.660
"Then you have to, basically,
make an educated guess",00:18:39.660,00:18:43.560
"whether you think that the theta
you're going to find is here",00:18:43.560,00:18:46.170
"or is here, and then
you pick your test.",00:18:46.170,00:18:47.880
Any other question?,00:18:51.089,00:18:51.880
Yes?,00:18:51.880,00:18:52.584
"AUDIENCE: Can you explain
the green curve again?",00:18:52.584,00:18:53.976
That's just the type II error?,00:18:53.976,00:18:55.255
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So the
green curve is-- exactly.",00:18:55.255,00:18:57.380
So that's beta psi of theta.,00:18:57.380,00:18:58.830
"So it's really
the type II error.",00:18:58.830,00:19:00.620
And it's defined only here.,00:19:00.620,00:19:02.730
"So here, it's not
a definition, it's",00:19:02.730,00:19:05.420
"really I'm just mapping
it to this point.",00:19:05.420,00:19:08.215
"So it's defined only here,
and it's the probability",00:19:08.215,00:19:10.340
of type II error.,00:19:10.340,00:19:11.048
"So here, it's pretty large.",00:19:15.510,00:19:17.555
"I'm making it,
basically, as large",00:19:17.555,00:19:19.530
"as I could because
I'm at the boundary,",00:19:19.530,00:19:22.330
"and that means, at the boundary,
since the status quo is h0,",00:19:22.330,00:19:26.410
"I'm always going
to go for h0 if I",00:19:26.410,00:19:29.394
"don't have any evidence, which
means that what's going to pay",00:19:29.394,00:19:31.935
"is the type II error that's
going to basically pay this.",00:19:31.935,00:19:34.268
Any other question?,00:19:38.059,00:19:38.850
So let's move on.,00:19:41.680,00:19:43.000
So did we do this?,00:19:43.000,00:19:47.190
"No, I think we
stopped here, right?",00:19:47.190,00:19:50.220
I didn't cover that part.,00:19:50.220,00:19:53.120
"So as I said, in
this paradigm, we're",00:19:53.120,00:19:55.310
"going to actually fix
this guy to be something.",00:19:55.310,00:19:58.040
"And this thing is actually
called the level of the test.",00:19:58.040,00:20:01.620
"I'm sorry, this is,
again, more words.",00:20:01.620,00:20:03.410
"Actually, the good news is that
we split it into two lectures.",00:20:03.410,00:20:06.920
"So we have, what is a test?",00:20:06.920,00:20:09.335
What is a hypothesis?,00:20:09.335,00:20:11.252
What is the null?,00:20:11.252,00:20:11.960
What is the alternative?,00:20:11.960,00:20:14.429
What is the type I error?,00:20:14.429,00:20:15.470
What is the type II error?,00:20:15.470,00:20:16.553
"And now, I'm telling you
there's another thing.",00:20:16.553,00:20:18.650
"So we define the power, which
was some sort of a lower bound",00:20:18.650,00:20:22.670
on the--,00:20:22.670,00:20:24.140
"or it's 1 minus the upper
bound on the type II",00:20:24.140,00:20:26.390
"error, basically.",00:20:26.390,00:20:28.540
"And so it's alternative--
so the power",00:20:28.540,00:20:32.480
"is the smallest
probability of rejecting",00:20:32.480,00:20:34.970
when you're in the null.,00:20:34.970,00:20:36.290
"And it's alternative when you're
in theta 1, so that's my power.",00:20:36.290,00:20:41.200
"I looked here, and I looked
at the smallest value.",00:20:41.200,00:20:43.760
"And I can look at this
side and say, well,",00:20:43.760,00:20:45.770
"what is the largest probability
that I make a type I error?",00:20:45.770,00:20:48.886
"Again, this largest probability
is the level of the test.",00:20:48.886,00:20:51.260
"So this is alpha
equal, by definition,",00:20:58.460,00:21:03.140
"to the maximum for theta in
theta 0 of alpha psi of theta.",00:21:03.140,00:21:15.490
"So here, I just put
the level itself.",00:21:15.490,00:21:18.340
"As you can see, here,
it essentially says",00:21:18.340,00:21:20.950
"that if I'm of level of
5%, I'm also of level 10%,",00:21:20.950,00:21:23.890
I'm also of level 15%.,00:21:23.890,00:21:25.600
"So here, it's really
an upper bound.",00:21:25.600,00:21:27.160
"Whatever you guys want to
take, this is what it is.",00:21:27.160,00:21:29.980
"But as we said, if
this number is 4.5%,",00:21:29.980,00:21:34.861
"you're losing in
your type II error.",00:21:34.861,00:21:36.360
So if you're allowed to have--,00:21:36.360,00:21:38.200
"if this maximum here is 4.5% and
FDA told you you can go to 5%,",00:21:38.200,00:21:43.420
"you're losing in
your type II error.",00:21:43.420,00:21:44.920
"So you actually
want to make sure",00:21:44.920,00:21:46.295
"that this is the 5%
that's given to you.",00:21:46.295,00:21:48.400
"So the way it works is
that you give me the alpha,",00:21:48.400,00:21:51.700
"then I'm going to go back, pick
c that depends on alpha here,",00:21:51.700,00:21:56.410
"so that this thing is
actually equal to 5%.",00:21:56.410,00:21:58.300
"And so of course,
in many instances,",00:22:01.590,00:22:04.800
we do not know the probability.,00:22:04.800,00:22:06.840
"We do not know how to compute
the probability of type I",00:22:06.840,00:22:09.290
error.,00:22:09.290,00:22:10.300
"This is a maximum value for the
probability of type I error.",00:22:10.300,00:22:12.930
We don't know how to compute it.,00:22:12.930,00:22:13.920
"I mean, it might be a very
complicated random variable.",00:22:13.920,00:22:15.900
Maybe it's a weird binomial.,00:22:15.900,00:22:17.300
"We could compute it,
but it would be painful.",00:22:17.300,00:22:19.500
"But we know how to compute
is its asymptotic value.",00:22:19.500,00:22:21.960
"Just because of the central
limit theorem, convergence",00:22:21.960,00:22:24.330
"and distribution tells me that
the probability of type I error",00:22:24.330,00:22:28.020
"is basically going
towards the probability",00:22:28.020,00:22:30.650
"that some Gaussian
is in some region.",00:22:30.650,00:22:33.110
"And so we're going to
compute, not the level itself,",00:22:33.110,00:22:36.240
but the asymptotic level.,00:22:36.240,00:22:37.500
"And that's basically
the limit as n",00:22:43.700,00:22:48.320
"goes to infinity of
alpha psi of theta.",00:22:48.320,00:22:56.830
"And then I'm going
to make the max here.",00:22:56.830,00:22:58.540
"So how am I going
to compute this?",00:23:06.300,00:23:08.240
"Well, if I take a test that has
rejection region of the form",00:23:08.240,00:23:13.440
tn--,00:23:13.440,00:23:14.910
"because it depends on the
data, that's tn of x1 xn--",00:23:14.910,00:23:17.970
"my observation's larger
than some number c.",00:23:17.970,00:23:23.440
"Of course, I can
almost always write",00:23:23.440,00:23:26.430
"tests like that,
except that sometimes,",00:23:26.430,00:23:28.402
"it's going to be an absolute
value, which essentially means",00:23:28.402,00:23:30.860
I'm going away from some value.,00:23:30.860,00:23:32.552
"Maybe, actually, I'm
less than something,",00:23:32.552,00:23:34.260
"but I can always put a negative
sign in front of everything.",00:23:34.260,00:23:37.090
"So this is not without
much of generality.",00:23:37.090,00:23:39.780
"So this includes something
that looks like--",00:23:39.780,00:23:47.890
"something is larger than the
constants, so that means--",00:23:51.520,00:23:56.290
"which is equivalent to--
well, let me write that as tq,",00:23:56.290,00:24:02.330
because then that means that--,00:24:02.330,00:24:05.510
so that's tn.,00:24:05.510,00:24:07.940
"But this actually
encompasses the fact",00:24:07.940,00:24:10.040
"that qn is larger than c or qn
is less than c and n minus c.",00:24:10.040,00:24:21.370
So that includes this guy.,00:24:21.370,00:24:22.480
"That also includes
qn less than c,",00:24:22.480,00:24:26.320
"because this is equivalent
to qn is larger than minus c.",00:24:26.320,00:24:32.840
And minus qn is--,00:24:32.840,00:24:33.830
and so that's going to be my tn.,00:24:33.830,00:24:35.240
"So I can actually encode
several type of things--",00:24:37.810,00:24:42.430
rejection regions.,00:24:42.430,00:24:44.230
"So here, in this case, I
have a rejection region",00:24:44.230,00:24:47.020
"that looks like this,
or a rejection region",00:24:47.020,00:24:50.110
"that looks like
this, or a rejection",00:24:50.110,00:24:53.380
region that looks like this.,00:24:53.380,00:24:54.550
"And here, I don't
really represent it",00:24:57.209,00:24:58.750
"for the whole data, but maybe
for the average, for example,",00:24:58.750,00:25:02.420
or the normalized average.,00:25:02.420,00:25:04.018
"So if I write this, then--",00:25:17.950,00:25:23.950
yeah.,00:25:23.950,00:25:25.470
"And in this case,
this tn that shows up",00:25:25.470,00:25:32.970
is called test statistic.,00:25:32.970,00:25:35.168
"I mean, this is
not set in stone.",00:25:41.460,00:25:43.730
"Here, for example, q could
be the test statistic.",00:25:43.730,00:25:46.930
"It doesn't have to
be minus q itself",00:25:46.930,00:25:48.640
that's the test statistic.,00:25:48.640,00:25:50.750
So what is the test statistic?,00:25:50.750,00:25:52.000
"Well, it's what you're going
to build from your data",00:25:52.000,00:25:55.170
"and then compare to
some fixed value.",00:25:55.170,00:25:57.790
"So in the example we had here,
what is our test statistic?",00:25:57.790,00:26:01.167
"Well, it's this guy.",00:26:01.167,00:26:02.000
This was our test statistic.,00:26:05.620,00:26:09.200
And is this thing a statistic?,00:26:09.200,00:26:12.830
"What are the criteria
for a statistic?",00:26:12.830,00:26:14.510
What is the statistic?,00:26:14.510,00:26:15.810
I know you know the answer.,00:26:21.046,00:26:23.633
AUDIENCE: Measurable function.,00:26:23.633,00:26:25.050
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah,
it's a measurable function",00:26:25.050,00:26:26.080
"of the data that does not
depend on the parameter.",00:26:26.080,00:26:29.064
Is this guy a statistic?,00:26:29.064,00:26:32.995
AUDIENCE: It's not.,00:26:32.995,00:26:33.981
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Let's think again.",00:26:35.949,00:26:37.490
"When I implemented the
test, what did I do?",00:26:40.490,00:26:45.360
I was able to compute my test.,00:26:45.360,00:26:47.490
"My test did not depend on
some unknown parameter.",00:26:47.490,00:26:49.800
How did we do it?,00:26:49.800,00:26:52.640
"We just plugged in
0.5 here, remember?",00:26:52.640,00:26:57.187
"That was the value for
which we computed it,",00:26:57.187,00:26:59.020
"because under h0, that was
the value we're seeing.",00:26:59.020,00:27:02.150
"And if theta 0 is
actually an entire set,",00:27:02.150,00:27:05.910
"I'm just going to take the
value that's the closest to h1.",00:27:05.910,00:27:09.935
We'll see that in a second.,00:27:09.935,00:27:11.060
"I mean, I did not
guarantee that to you.",00:27:11.060,00:27:13.400
"But just taking the worst type
I error and bounded by alpha",00:27:13.400,00:27:18.950
"is equivalent to taking p and
taking the value of p that's",00:27:18.950,00:27:22.310
"the closest to theta 1, which
is completely intuitive.",00:27:22.310,00:27:26.836
"The worst type I error is going
to be attained for the p that's",00:27:26.836,00:27:29.460
the closest to the alternative.,00:27:29.460,00:27:32.260
"So even if the null is
actually just an entire set,",00:27:32.260,00:27:36.510
"it's as if it was
just the point that's",00:27:36.510,00:27:38.940
the closest to the alternative.,00:27:38.940,00:27:41.840
"So now we can compute
this, because there's",00:27:41.840,00:27:44.520
"no unknown parameters
that shows up.",00:27:44.520,00:27:46.440
We replace p by 0.5.,00:27:46.440,00:27:48.210
"And so that was
our test statistic.",00:27:48.210,00:27:50.406
"So when you're
building a test, you",00:27:53.952,00:27:55.410
"want to first build
a test statistic,",00:27:55.410,00:27:58.000
"and then see what threshold
you should be getting.",00:27:58.000,00:28:01.230
"So now, let's go back to our
example where we want to have--",00:28:01.230,00:28:08.640
"we have x1 xn, their
IID [INAUDIBLE] p.",00:28:08.640,00:28:16.340
"And I want to test if p is
1/2 versus p not equal to 1/2,",00:28:16.340,00:28:25.050
"which, as I said, is what
you want to do if you",00:28:25.050,00:28:27.630
want to test if a coin is fair.,00:28:27.630,00:28:33.560
"And so here, I'm going to
build a test statistic.",00:28:33.560,00:28:36.560
"And we concluded
last time that--",00:28:36.560,00:28:39.180
"what do we want
for this statistic?",00:28:39.180,00:28:41.790
"We want it to have a
distribution which,",00:28:41.790,00:28:44.700
"under the null, does not
depend on the parameters,",00:28:44.700,00:28:49.820
"a distribution that I can
actually compute quintiles of.",00:28:49.820,00:28:54.650
"So what we did
is, we said, well,",00:28:54.650,00:28:56.150
"if I look at-- the central limit
theorem tells me that square",00:28:56.150,00:28:59.210
"root of n xn bar
minus p divided by--",00:28:59.210,00:29:03.500
"so if I do central limit theorem
plus Slutsky, for example,",00:29:03.500,00:29:06.871
I'm going to have square root.,00:29:06.871,00:29:08.120
"And we've had this
discussion whether we want",00:29:12.006,00:29:13.880
to use Slutsky or not here.,00:29:13.880,00:29:15.004
"But let's assume we're taking
Slutsky wherever we can.",00:29:15.004,00:29:17.900
"So this thing tells me
that, by the central limit",00:29:17.900,00:29:20.060
"theorem, as n goes to
infinity, this thing converges",00:29:20.060,00:29:23.510
in distribution to some n01.,00:29:23.510,00:29:25.190
"Now, as we said, this guy
is not something we know.",00:29:28.260,00:29:31.550
"But under the null,
we actually know it.",00:29:31.550,00:29:34.020
"And we can actually
replace it by 1/2.",00:29:34.020,00:29:37.100
So this thing holds under h0.,00:29:37.100,00:29:41.300
"When I write under h0, it
means when this is the truth.",00:29:41.300,00:29:44.300
"So now I have something
that converges",00:29:47.120,00:29:49.270
"to something that has no
dependence on anything I",00:29:49.270,00:29:52.570
don't know.,00:29:52.570,00:29:53.170
"And in particular, if you have
any statistics textbook, which",00:29:53.170,00:29:56.890
"you don't because I
didn't require one--",00:29:56.890,00:29:59.260
"and you should be thankful,
because these things cost $350.",00:29:59.260,00:30:04.444
"Actually, if you
look at the back,",00:30:04.444,00:30:05.860
"you actually have a table
for a standard Gaussian.",00:30:05.860,00:30:12.250
I could have anything else here.,00:30:12.250,00:30:13.780
"I could have an
exponential distribution.",00:30:13.780,00:30:15.760
I could have a--,00:30:15.760,00:30:17.560
"I don't know-- well,
we'll see the chi squared",00:30:17.560,00:30:20.320
distribution in a minute.,00:30:20.320,00:30:22.030
"Any distribution from
which you can actually",00:30:22.030,00:30:24.040
"see a table that
somebody actually",00:30:24.040,00:30:25.600
"computed this thing for
which you can actually",00:30:25.600,00:30:27.516
"draw the pdf and start computing
whatever probability you want",00:30:27.516,00:30:30.430
"on them, then this
is what you want",00:30:30.430,00:30:32.410
to see at the right-hand side.,00:30:32.410,00:30:35.110
This is any distribution.,00:30:35.110,00:30:36.500
It's called pivotal.,00:30:36.500,00:30:38.380
"I think we've
mentioned that before.",00:30:38.380,00:30:39.880
"Pivotal means it does
not depend on anything",00:30:39.880,00:30:41.713
that you don't know.,00:30:41.713,00:30:43.610
"And maybe it's easy to
compute those things.",00:30:43.610,00:30:45.616
"Probably, typically, you need
a computer to simulate them",00:30:45.616,00:30:47.990
"for you because computing
probabilities for Gaussians",00:30:47.990,00:30:50.985
is not an easy thing.,00:30:50.985,00:30:51.860
"We don't know how to solve
those integrals exactly,",00:30:51.860,00:30:53.985
we have to do it numerically.,00:30:53.985,00:30:56.520
So now I want to do this test.,00:30:56.520,00:31:08.420
"My test statistic will
be declared to be what?",00:31:08.420,00:31:12.950
"Well, I'm going
to reject if what",00:31:12.950,00:31:17.740
is larger than some number?,00:31:17.740,00:31:18.970
The absolute value of this guy.,00:31:24.140,00:31:27.500
"So my test statistic
is going to be",00:31:27.500,00:31:29.550
"square root of n minus 0.5
divided by square root of xn",00:31:29.550,00:31:35.790
bar 1 minus xn bar.,00:31:35.790,00:31:38.240
"That's my test statistic,
absolute value of this guy,",00:31:41.160,00:31:43.470
"because I want to reject either
when this guy is too large",00:31:43.470,00:31:45.900
or when this guy is too small.,00:31:45.900,00:31:47.150
"I don't know ahead
whether I'm going",00:31:50.260,00:31:51.760
"to see p larger than
1/2 or less than 1/2.",00:31:51.760,00:31:55.470
"So now I need to compute c
such that the probability",00:31:55.470,00:31:59.190
that tn is larger than c.,00:31:59.190,00:32:05.210
"So that's the probability
under p, which is unknown.",00:32:05.210,00:32:11.290
"I want this probability to be
less than some level alpha,",00:32:11.290,00:32:17.230
asymptotically.,00:32:17.230,00:32:18.410
"So I want the limit of this
guy to be less than alpha,",00:32:18.410,00:32:24.740
and that's the level of my test.,00:32:24.740,00:32:26.810
So that's the given level.,00:32:26.810,00:32:32.010
So I want this thing to happen.,00:32:32.010,00:32:33.720
"Now, what I know is
that this limit--",00:32:33.720,00:32:35.280
"actually, I should say
given asymptotic level.",00:32:38.090,00:32:40.397
So what is this thing?,00:32:48.520,00:32:50.130
"Well, OK, that's the
probability that something",00:32:54.300,00:33:00.600
that looks like under p.,00:33:00.600,00:33:03.000
"So under p, this guy--",00:33:03.000,00:33:05.520
"so what I know is that
tn is square root of n",00:33:05.520,00:33:08.730
"minus xn bar minus 0.5 divided
by square root of xn bar",00:33:08.730,00:33:15.490
1 minus xn bar exceeds.,00:33:15.490,00:33:18.700
"Is this true that
as n to infinity,",00:33:23.770,00:33:26.882
"this probability is the
same as the probability",00:33:26.882,00:33:28.840
"that the absolute
value of a Gaussian",00:33:28.840,00:33:30.460
"exceeds c of a
standard Gaussian?",00:33:30.460,00:33:33.610
Is this true?,00:33:33.610,00:33:34.351
"AUDIENCE: The absolute value
of the standard Gaussian.",00:33:37.281,00:33:39.530
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Yeah, the absolute.",00:33:39.530,00:33:41.113
"So you're saying that this, as
n becomes large enough, this",00:33:41.113,00:33:43.830
"should be the probability that
some absolute value of n01",00:33:43.830,00:33:48.500
"exceeds c, right?",00:33:48.500,00:33:49.898
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:33:49.898,00:33:51.990
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So I claim
that this is not correct.",00:33:51.990,00:33:54.780
Somebody tell me why.,00:33:54.780,00:33:56.077
"AUDIENCE: Even in the
limit it's not correct?",00:33:56.077,00:33:57.360
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Even in
the limit, it's not correct.",00:33:57.360,00:33:59.651
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:34:03.164,00:34:04.334
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
So what do you see?",00:34:04.334,00:34:05.917
"AUDIENCE: It's because,
at the beginning,",00:34:05.917,00:34:07.625
"we picked the worst possible
true parameter, 0.5.",00:34:07.625,00:34:11.368
"So we don't actually know
that this 0.5 is the mean.",00:34:11.368,00:34:13.915
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Exactly.,00:34:13.915,00:34:15.040
"So we pick this 0.5 here,
but this is for any p.",00:34:15.040,00:34:19.500
"But what is the
only p I can get?",00:34:19.500,00:34:21.360
"So what I want is that this
is true for all p in theta 0.",00:34:21.360,00:34:26.949
"But the only p that's in theta
0 is actually p is equal to 0.5.",00:34:26.949,00:34:31.750
"So yes, what you
said was true, but it",00:34:31.750,00:34:33.780
"required to specify
p to be equal to 0.5.",00:34:33.780,00:34:38.130
"So this, in general,
is not true.",00:34:38.130,00:34:40.409
"But it happens to be true if
p belongs to theta 0, which",00:34:40.409,00:34:47.909
"is strictly equivalent
to p is equal to 0.5,",00:34:47.909,00:34:53.489
"because theta 0 is really
just this one point, 0.5.",00:34:53.489,00:34:59.320
"So now, this becomes true.",00:34:59.320,00:35:01.820
"And so what I need to
do is to find c such",00:35:01.820,00:35:03.760
that this guy is equal to what?,00:35:03.760,00:35:05.140
"I mean, let's just follow.",00:35:11.650,00:35:14.020
"So I want this to
be less than alpha.",00:35:14.020,00:35:16.950
"But then we said that
this was equal to this,",00:35:16.950,00:35:19.850
which is equal to this.,00:35:19.850,00:35:21.970
"So all I want is that this
guy is less than alpha.",00:35:21.970,00:35:24.960
"But we said we might as well
just make it equal to alpha",00:35:24.960,00:35:28.230
"if you allow me to make
it as big as I want,",00:35:28.230,00:35:30.540
as long as it's less than alpha.,00:35:30.540,00:35:32.050
"AUDIENCE: So this
is a true statement.",00:35:32.050,00:35:33.790
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So
this is a true statement.",00:35:33.790,00:35:35.748
But it's under this condition.,00:35:35.748,00:35:38.354
AUDIENCE: Exactly.,00:35:38.354,00:35:39.104
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So I'm
going to set it equal to alpha,",00:35:43.010,00:35:48.680
"and then I'm going to
try to solve for c.",00:35:48.680,00:35:52.310
"So what I'm looking
for is a c such that",00:36:10.390,00:36:13.540
if I draw a standard Gaussian--,00:36:13.540,00:36:17.390
so that's pdf of some n01--,00:36:17.390,00:36:20.530
"I want the probability that the
absolute value of my Gaussian",00:36:20.530,00:36:23.200
exceeding this guy--,00:36:23.200,00:36:25.630
"so that means being
either here or here.",00:36:25.630,00:36:29.350
So that's minus c and c.,00:36:29.350,00:36:31.220
"I want the sum of those two
things to be equal to alpha.",00:36:31.220,00:36:36.200
"So I want the sum of these
areas to equal alpha.",00:36:36.200,00:36:53.570
"So by symmetry,
each of them should",00:36:53.570,00:36:56.240
be equal to alpha over 2.,00:36:56.240,00:36:58.190
"And so what I'm looking for
is c such that the probability",00:37:02.710,00:37:08.310
"that my n01 exceeds c, which
is just this area to the right,",00:37:08.310,00:37:15.410
"now, equals alpha, which is
equivalent to taking c, which",00:37:15.410,00:37:20.830
"is q equals alpha over 2,
and that's q alpha over 2",00:37:20.830,00:37:26.020
by definition of q alpha over 2.,00:37:26.020,00:37:28.240
"That's just what
q alpha over 2 is.",00:37:28.240,00:37:30.370
"And that's what the tables at
the back of the book give you.",00:37:30.370,00:37:34.420
"Who has already seen a table
for Gaussian probabilities?",00:37:34.420,00:37:42.400
"What it does, it's just a table.",00:37:42.400,00:37:44.200
"I mean, it's pretty ancient.",00:37:44.200,00:37:45.696
"I mean, of course,
you can actually ask",00:37:45.696,00:37:47.320
Google to do it for you now.,00:37:47.320,00:37:49.240
"I mean, it's basically
standard issue.",00:37:49.240,00:37:52.180
"But back in the day, they
actually had to look at tables.",00:37:52.180,00:37:56.110
"And since the values alphas
were pretty standard,",00:37:56.110,00:37:59.140
"the values alpha that
people were requesting",00:37:59.140,00:38:01.510
"were typically 1%,
5%, 10%, all you",00:38:01.510,00:38:04.810
"could do is to compute
these different values",00:38:04.810,00:38:07.000
for different values of alpha.,00:38:07.000,00:38:08.560
That was it.,00:38:08.560,00:38:10.390
"So there's really
not much to give you.",00:38:10.390,00:38:13.450
"So for the Gaussian,
I can tell you",00:38:13.450,00:38:15.750
"that alpha is equal to--
if alpha is equal to 5%,",00:38:15.750,00:38:20.210
"then q alpha over 2, q 2.5%
is equal to 1.96, for example.",00:38:20.210,00:38:27.100
"So those are just
fixed numbers that",00:38:27.100,00:38:28.840
are functions of the Gaussian.,00:38:28.840,00:38:31.030
So everybody agrees?,00:38:31.030,00:38:32.410
"We've done that before for
our confidence intervals.",00:38:32.410,00:38:37.443
"And so now we know
that if I actually",00:38:40.350,00:38:42.040
"plug in this guy to be
q alpha over 2, then",00:38:42.040,00:38:48.460
"this limit is actually
equal to alpha.",00:38:48.460,00:38:51.430
"And so now I've actually
constrained this.",00:38:51.430,00:38:53.247
"So q alpha over 2 here for alpha
equals 5%, as I said, is 1.96.",00:39:01.040,00:39:07.800
"So in the example 1, the
number that we found was 3.54,",00:39:07.800,00:39:13.790
"I think, or something
like that, 3.55 for t.",00:39:13.790,00:39:18.800
"So if we scroll back
very quickly, 3.45--",00:39:18.800,00:39:29.290
that was example 1.,00:39:29.290,00:39:30.980
Example two-- negative 0.77.,00:39:30.980,00:39:33.770
"So if I look at tn
in example 1, tn",00:39:33.770,00:39:40.970
"was just the absolute
value of 3.45, which--",00:39:40.970,00:39:46.040
"don't pull out your
calculators-- is equal to 3.45.",00:39:46.040,00:39:50.390
"Example 2, absolute
value of negative 0.77",00:39:50.390,00:39:54.500
was equal to 0.77.,00:39:54.500,00:39:57.050
"And so all I need to
check is, is this number",00:39:57.050,00:39:59.450
larger or smaller than 1.96?,00:39:59.450,00:40:01.610
"That's what my
test ends up being.",00:40:01.610,00:40:06.530
"So in example 1,
3.45 being larger",00:40:06.530,00:40:12.860
"than 1.96, that
means that I reject.",00:40:12.860,00:40:18.885
"Fairness of my
coins, in example 2,",00:40:18.885,00:40:22.790
0.77 being smaller than 1.96--,00:40:22.790,00:40:27.230
what do I do?,00:40:27.230,00:40:29.370
I fail to reject.,00:40:29.370,00:40:30.270
So here is a question.,00:40:44.084,00:40:45.000
"In example 1, for what level
alpha would psi alpha--",00:40:47.730,00:40:54.270
"OK, so here, what's
going to happen",00:40:57.530,00:41:00.090
if I start decreasing my level?,00:41:00.090,00:41:04.350
"When I decrease my
level, I'm actually",00:41:04.350,00:41:07.020
"making this area
smaller and smaller,",00:41:07.020,00:41:09.100
"which means that I push
this c to the right.",00:41:09.100,00:41:13.360
"So now I'm asking,
what is the smallest c",00:41:13.360,00:41:17.080
"I should pick so that now,
I actually do not reject h0?",00:41:17.080,00:41:22.360
"What is the smallest c
I should be taking here?",00:41:22.360,00:41:29.642
What is the smallest c?,00:41:29.642,00:41:30.600
"So c here, in the example I
gave you for 5%, was 1.96.",00:41:37.520,00:41:43.300
"What is the smallest c I
should be taking so that now,",00:41:43.300,00:41:49.330
this inequality is reversed?,00:41:49.330,00:41:50.730
3.45.,00:41:54.980,00:41:55.990
"I ask only trivial
questions, don't be worried.",00:41:55.990,00:41:58.900
"So 3.45 is the smallest
c that I'm actually",00:41:58.900,00:42:02.890
willing to tolerate.,00:42:02.890,00:42:04.870
So let's say this was my 5%.,00:42:04.870,00:42:07.870
If this was 2.5--,00:42:07.870,00:42:09.730
"if here, let's say,
in this picture,",00:42:09.730,00:42:11.230
"alpha is 5%, that means
maybe I need to push here.",00:42:11.230,00:42:16.490
And this number should be what?,00:42:16.490,00:42:18.150
So this is going to be 1.96.,00:42:18.150,00:42:20.580
"And this number here is going
to be 3.45, clearly to scale.",00:42:20.580,00:42:26.460
"And so now, what I
want to ask you is,",00:42:26.460,00:42:30.330
"well, there's two ways I can
understand this number 3.45.",00:42:30.330,00:42:33.570
"It is the number
3.45, but I can also",00:42:33.570,00:42:36.120
"try to understand what is the
area to the right of this guy.",00:42:36.120,00:42:40.340
"And if I understand what the
area to the right of this guy",00:42:40.340,00:42:42.780
"is, this is actually
some alpha prime over 2.",00:42:42.780,00:42:47.700
"And that means
that if I actually",00:42:47.700,00:42:49.560
"fix this level alpha
prime, that would",00:42:49.560,00:42:53.840
"be exactly the tipping
point at which I would",00:42:53.840,00:42:57.260
go from accepting to rejecting.,00:42:57.260,00:43:01.420
"So I knew, in terms of
absolute thresholds,",00:43:01.420,00:43:04.390
"3.45 is the trivial
answer to the question.",00:43:04.390,00:43:07.300
"That's the tipping
point, because I'm",00:43:07.300,00:43:09.040
comparing a number to 3.45.,00:43:09.040,00:43:11.350
"But now, if I try
to map this back",00:43:11.350,00:43:13.330
"and understand what level
would have been giving me",00:43:13.330,00:43:16.570
"this particular
tipping point, that's",00:43:16.570,00:43:18.910
a number between 0 and 1.,00:43:18.910,00:43:21.430
"The smaller the number, the
larger this number here,",00:43:21.430,00:43:25.830
"which means that the more
evidence I have in my data",00:43:25.830,00:43:28.280
against h0.,00:43:28.280,00:43:30.990
"And so this number is actually
something called the p-value.",00:43:30.990,00:43:36.140
"And so saying, for
example 2, there's",00:43:36.140,00:43:38.640
"the tipping point
alpha at which I",00:43:38.640,00:43:40.880
"go from failing to
reject to rejecting.",00:43:40.880,00:43:44.150
"And that's exactly the number,
the area under the curve,",00:43:44.150,00:43:47.990
"such that here, I see 0.77.",00:43:47.990,00:43:53.990
"And this is this alpha
prime prime over 2.",00:43:53.990,00:43:56.710
"Alpha prime prime is
clearly larger than 5%.",00:43:59.660,00:44:04.090
"So what's the advantage of
thinking and mapping back",00:44:04.090,00:44:06.630
these numbers?,00:44:06.630,00:44:08.170
"Well, now, I'm actually going
to spit out some number which",00:44:08.170,00:44:11.790
is between 0 and 1.,00:44:11.790,00:44:12.900
"And that should be the only
scale you should have in mind.",00:44:12.900,00:44:18.827
"Remember, we discussed
that last time.",00:44:18.827,00:44:20.410
"I was like, well, if
I actually spit out",00:44:20.410,00:44:22.750
"a number which is 3.45,
maybe you can try to think,",00:44:22.750,00:44:26.200
"is 3.45 a large
number for a Gaussian?",00:44:26.200,00:44:29.230
That's a number.,00:44:29.230,00:44:29.897
"But if I had another random
variable that was not Gaussian,",00:44:29.897,00:44:32.355
"maybe it was a
double exponential,",00:44:32.355,00:44:33.910
"you would have to have
another scale in your mind.",00:44:33.910,00:44:36.220
"Is 3.45 so large that
it's unlikely for it",00:44:36.220,00:44:42.880
"to come from a
double exponential.",00:44:42.880,00:44:44.680
If I had a gamma distribution--,00:44:44.680,00:44:46.300
"I can think of any distribution,
and then that means,",00:44:46.300,00:44:48.508
"for each distribution, you would
have to have scale in mind.",00:44:48.508,00:44:51.040
"So of course, you can have
the Gaussian scale in mind.",00:44:51.040,00:44:53.290
"I mean, I have the
Gaussian scale in mind.",00:44:53.290,00:44:55.270
"But then, if I map it back into
this number between 0 and 1,",00:44:55.270,00:44:59.740
"all the distributions
play the same role.",00:44:59.740,00:45:02.260
"So whether I'm talking about
if my limiting distribution is",00:45:02.260,00:45:05.920
"normal or exponential or
gamma, or whatever you want,",00:45:05.920,00:45:09.874
"for all these guys,
I'm just going",00:45:09.874,00:45:11.290
"to map it into one
number between 0 and 1.",00:45:11.290,00:45:13.450
"Small number means lots
of evidence against h1.",00:45:13.450,00:45:16.210
"Large number means lots
of evidence against h0.",00:45:16.210,00:45:21.040
"Small number means very
few evidence against h9.",00:45:21.040,00:45:25.210
"And this is the only number
you need to keep in mind.",00:45:25.210,00:45:27.800
"And the question
is, am I willing",00:45:27.800,00:45:29.710
"to tolerate this number between
5%, 6%, or maybe 10%, 12%?",00:45:29.710,00:45:34.570
"And this is the only scale
you have to have in mind.",00:45:34.570,00:45:37.720
"And this scale is the
scale of p-values.",00:45:37.720,00:45:41.030
"So the p-value is the tipping
point in terms of alpha.",00:45:41.030,00:45:48.120
"In words, I can make it
formal, because tipping point,",00:45:48.120,00:45:52.050
"as far as I know, is
not a mathematical term.",00:45:52.050,00:45:54.510
"So a p-value of a
test is the smallest,",00:45:54.510,00:45:58.950
"potentially asymptotic level
if I talk about an asymptotic",00:45:58.950,00:46:01.740
p-value--,00:46:01.740,00:46:02.910
"and that's what we do when we
talk about central theorem--",00:46:02.910,00:46:05.520
at which the test rejects h0.,00:46:05.520,00:46:09.410
If I were to go any smaller--,00:46:09.410,00:46:10.820
"sorry, it's the smallest level--",00:46:14.640,00:46:17.750
"yeah, if I were
to go any smaller,",00:46:17.750,00:46:19.360
I would fail to reject.,00:46:19.360,00:46:21.250
"The smaller the level, the less
likely it is for me to reject.",00:46:21.250,00:46:25.200
"And if I were to
go any smaller, I",00:46:25.200,00:46:26.710
would start failing to reject.,00:46:26.710,00:46:31.010
And so it is a random number.,00:46:31.010,00:46:33.210
"It depends on what
I actually observe.",00:46:33.210,00:46:35.790
"So here, of course, I
instantiated those two numbers,",00:46:35.790,00:46:39.240
"3.45 and 0.77, as realizations
of random variables.",00:46:39.240,00:46:44.202
"But if you think of those
as being the random numbers",00:46:44.202,00:46:46.410
"before I see my data,
this was a random number,",00:46:46.410,00:46:50.190
"and therefore, the area under
the curve to the right of it",00:46:50.190,00:46:53.550
is also a random area.,00:46:53.550,00:46:55.830
"If this thing fluctuates,
then the area under the curve",00:46:55.830,00:46:58.920
fluctuates.,00:46:58.920,00:47:00.090
And that's what the p-value is.,00:47:00.090,00:47:02.150
That's what-- what is his name?,00:47:02.150,00:47:05.950
I forget.,00:47:05.950,00:47:06.780
"John Oliver talks about when
he talks about p-hacking.",00:47:06.780,00:47:10.470
"And so we talked about
this in the first lecture.",00:47:10.470,00:47:14.150
"So p-hacking is, how do I
do-- oh, if I'm a scientist,",00:47:14.150,00:47:18.194
"do I want to see a small
p-value or a large p-value?",00:47:18.194,00:47:20.360
AUDIENCE: Small.,00:47:20.360,00:47:21.027
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Small, right?",00:47:21.027,00:47:22.359
"Scientists want to see small
p-values because small p-values",00:47:22.359,00:47:24.960
"equals rejecting,
which equals discovery,",00:47:24.960,00:47:28.020
"which equals publications,
which equals promotion.",00:47:28.020,00:47:31.230
"So that's what
people want to see.",00:47:31.230,00:47:34.550
"So people are tempted
to see small p-values.",00:47:34.550,00:47:37.970
"And what's called p-hacking
is, well, find a way to cheat.",00:47:37.970,00:47:41.660
"Maybe look at your data,
formulate your hypothesis",00:47:41.660,00:47:44.450
"in such a way that you will
actually have a smaller",00:47:44.450,00:47:49.840
p-value than you should have.,00:47:49.840,00:47:51.375
"So here, for example,
there's one thing",00:47:51.375,00:47:53.000
"I did not insist on
because, again, this is not",00:47:53.000,00:47:54.958
"a particular course on
statistical thinking,",00:47:54.958,00:47:57.200
"but one thing that
we implicitly did",00:47:57.200,00:47:59.420
"was set those theta 0 and
theta 1 ahead of time.",00:47:59.420,00:48:04.750
"I fixed them, and I'm
trying to test this.",00:48:04.750,00:48:08.378
"This is to be contrasted
with the following approach.",00:48:08.378,00:48:11.280
I draw my data.,00:48:11.280,00:48:13.350
So I draw--,00:48:13.350,00:48:15.224
"I run this experiment,
which is probably",00:48:15.224,00:48:16.890
"going to get me a
publication in nature.",00:48:16.890,00:48:18.840
"I'm trying to test
if a coin is fair.",00:48:18.840,00:48:23.010
"And I draw my data,
and I see that there's",00:48:23.010,00:48:24.760
"13 out of 30 of my
observations that are heads.",00:48:24.760,00:48:31.020
"That means that,
from this data, it",00:48:31.020,00:48:32.610
looks like p is less than 1/2.,00:48:32.610,00:48:36.850
"So if I look at
this data and then",00:48:36.850,00:48:38.560
"decide that my alternative
is not p not equal to 1/2,",00:48:38.560,00:48:42.870
"but rather p less than
1/2, that's p-hacking.",00:48:42.870,00:48:47.300
"I'm actually making my
p-value strictly smaller",00:48:47.300,00:48:50.550
"by first looking at the
data, and then deciding what",00:48:50.550,00:48:53.130
my alternative is going to be.,00:48:53.130,00:48:54.660
"And that's cheating, because
all the things we did,",00:48:54.660,00:48:58.770
"we're assuming that this
0.5, or the alternative,",00:48:58.770,00:49:02.970
"was actually a fixed--
everything was deterministic.",00:49:02.970,00:49:05.240
"The only randomness
came from the data.",00:49:05.240,00:49:07.164
"But if I start
looking at the data",00:49:07.164,00:49:08.580
"and designing my experiment
or my alternatives",00:49:08.580,00:49:11.130
"and null hypothesis
based on the data,",00:49:11.130,00:49:13.232
"it's as if I started putting
randomness all over the place.",00:49:13.232,00:49:15.690
"And then I cannot control it
because I don't know how it",00:49:15.690,00:49:18.300
"just intermingles
with each other.",00:49:18.300,00:49:22.960
"So that was for the
John Oliver moment.",00:49:22.960,00:49:26.170
So the p-value is nice.,00:49:29.940,00:49:32.340
"So maybe I mentioned
that, before, my wife",00:49:32.340,00:49:35.500
works in market research.,00:49:35.500,00:49:36.610
"And maybe every two
years, she seems",00:49:36.610,00:49:40.240
"to run into a statistician
in the hallway,",00:49:40.240,00:49:42.370
"and she comes home and says,
what is a p-value again?",00:49:42.370,00:49:45.070
"And for her, a p-value
is just the number",00:49:45.070,00:49:48.190
in an Excel spreadsheet.,00:49:48.190,00:49:50.080
"And actually, small equals
good and large equals bad.",00:49:50.080,00:49:55.360
"And that's all she needs
to know at this point.",00:49:55.360,00:49:57.820
"Actually, they do the job
for her-- small is green,",00:49:57.820,00:50:01.310
large is red.,00:50:01.310,00:50:02.290
"And so for her, a p-value
is just green or red.",00:50:02.290,00:50:06.590
"But so what she's
really implicitly doing",00:50:06.590,00:50:08.740
"with this color code is just
applying the golden rule.",00:50:08.740,00:50:12.980
"What the statisticians do for
her in the Excel spreadsheet",00:50:12.980,00:50:16.210
"is that they take the
numbers for the p-values that",00:50:16.210,00:50:18.760
are less than some fixed level.,00:50:18.760,00:50:20.440
"So depending on the field
in which she works--",00:50:20.440,00:50:22.390
"so she works for
pharmaceutical companies--",00:50:22.390,00:50:24.410
"so the p-values are
typically compared--",00:50:24.410,00:50:26.560
"the tests are usually performed
at level 1%, rather than 5%.",00:50:26.560,00:50:31.030
"So 5% is maybe
your gold standard",00:50:31.030,00:50:33.040
"if you're doing
sociology or trying to--",00:50:33.040,00:50:36.550
"I don't know-- release
a new blueberry flavor",00:50:36.550,00:50:39.970
for your toothpaste.,00:50:39.970,00:50:40.990
"Something that's not going
to change the life of people,",00:50:40.990,00:50:43.630
maybe you're going to run at 5%.,00:50:43.630,00:50:45.040
It's OK to make a mistake.,00:50:45.040,00:50:46.150
"See, people are just
going to feel gross,",00:50:46.150,00:50:47.858
"but that's about
it, whereas here,",00:50:47.858,00:50:50.770
"if you have this p-value
which is less than 1%,",00:50:50.770,00:50:53.296
"it might be more important
for some drug discovery,",00:50:53.296,00:50:55.420
for example.,00:50:55.420,00:50:56.550
And so let's say you run at 1%.,00:50:56.550,00:50:59.810
"And so what they do in
this Excel spreadsheet is",00:50:59.810,00:51:02.470
"that all the numbers that
are below 1% show up in green",00:51:02.470,00:51:05.800
"and all the numbers that
are above 1% show up in red.",00:51:05.800,00:51:09.010
And that's it.,00:51:09.010,00:51:09.790
"That's just applying
the golden rule.",00:51:09.790,00:51:11.710
"If the number is green, reject.",00:51:11.710,00:51:13.640
"If the number is
red, fail to reject.",00:51:13.640,00:51:18.024
Yeah?,00:51:18.024,00:51:18.524
"AUDIENCE: So going
back to example 2",00:51:18.524,00:51:20.512
"where the prior
example where you",00:51:20.512,00:51:23.991
"want to cheat by
looking after beta",00:51:23.991,00:51:26.476
"and then formulating, say,
theta 1 to be p less than 1/2.",00:51:26.476,00:51:32.450
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.,00:51:32.450,00:51:33.914
"AUDIENCE: So how would
you achieve your goal",00:51:33.914,00:51:38.306

you want to be published.",00:51:46.700,00:51:47.930

"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: [LAUGHS]
So let me teach you how, then.",00:51:48.555,00:51:54.410
"So well, here, what do you do?",00:51:54.410,00:51:58.160
"You want to-- at
the end of the day,",00:51:58.160,00:52:03.380
"a test is only telling you
whether you found evidence",00:52:03.380,00:52:06.200
"in your data that h1 was more
likely than h0, basically.",00:52:06.200,00:52:11.150
How do you make h1 more likely?,00:52:11.150,00:52:12.830
"Well, you just basically
target h1 to be what it is--",00:52:12.830,00:52:18.500
"what the data is going to
make it more likely to be.",00:52:18.500,00:52:21.740
"So if, for example, I say
h1 can be on both sides,",00:52:21.740,00:52:26.210
"then my data is going to have to
take into account fluctuations",00:52:26.210,00:52:29.177
"on both sides, and I'm going to
lose a factor or two somewhere",00:52:29.177,00:52:31.760
"because things
are not symmetric.",00:52:31.760,00:52:33.690
"Here is the ultimate
way of making this work.",00:52:33.690,00:52:38.240
"I'm going back to my
example of flipping coins.",00:52:38.240,00:52:42.920
"And now, so here,
what I did is, I said,",00:52:42.920,00:52:45.790
"oh, this number 0.43 is
actually smaller than 0.5,",00:52:45.790,00:52:54.690
"so I'm just going to
test whether I'm 0.5",00:52:54.690,00:52:56.640
or I'm less than 0.5.,00:52:56.640,00:52:58.780
"But here is something
that I can promise you",00:52:58.780,00:53:01.050
"I did not make the
computation will reject.",00:53:01.050,00:53:04.380
"So here, this one actually--",00:53:04.380,00:53:06.180
"yeah, this one fails to reject.",00:53:06.180,00:53:08.280
"So here is one that
will certainly reject.",00:53:08.280,00:53:11.080
"h0 is 0.5, p is
0.5, h1p is 0.43.",00:53:11.080,00:53:24.950
"Now, you can try,
but I can promise you",00:53:24.950,00:53:27.830
"that your data will tell you
that h1 is the right one.",00:53:27.830,00:53:32.030
"I mean, you can check very
quickly that this is really",00:53:32.030,00:53:36.110
extremely likely to happen.,00:53:36.110,00:53:37.780
"Actually, what am I--",00:53:40.795,00:53:41.670
"no, actually, that's
not true, because here,",00:53:45.050,00:53:52.220
"the test that I derive that's
based on this kind of stuff,",00:53:52.220,00:53:56.330
"here at some point,
somewhere under some layers,",00:53:56.330,00:53:59.960
"I assume that all our tests
are going to have this form.",00:53:59.960,00:54:04.450
"But here, this is
only when you're",00:54:04.450,00:54:06.030
"trying to test one region versus
another region next to it,",00:54:06.030,00:54:09.030
"or one point versus
a region around it,",00:54:09.030,00:54:11.030
"or something like this,
whereas for this guy,",00:54:11.030,00:54:13.140
"there's another test
that could come up with,",00:54:13.140,00:54:15.640
"which is, what is the
probability that I get 0.43,",00:54:15.640,00:54:18.720
"and what is the
probability that I get 0.5?",00:54:18.720,00:54:21.786
"Now, what I'm
going to do is, I'm",00:54:21.786,00:54:23.160
"going to just conclude
it's whichever",00:54:23.160,00:54:25.680
has the largest probability.,00:54:25.680,00:54:27.607
"Then maybe I'm going to have
to make some adjustments so",00:54:27.607,00:54:29.940
that the level is actually 5%.,00:54:29.940,00:54:32.310
But I can make this happen.,00:54:32.310,00:54:33.690
"I can make the level be 5%
and always conclude this guy,",00:54:33.690,00:54:36.890
"but I would have to
use a different test.",00:54:36.890,00:54:38.610
"Now, the test that
I described, again,",00:54:38.610,00:54:40.290
"those tn larger
than c are built in",00:54:40.290,00:54:42.870
"to be tests that are resilient
to these kind of manipulations",00:54:42.870,00:54:46.170
"because they're
oblivious towards what",00:54:46.170,00:54:48.840
the alternative looks like.,00:54:48.840,00:54:50.490
"I mean, they're just saying
it's either to the left",00:54:50.490,00:54:51.960
"or to the right,
but whether it's",00:54:51.960,00:54:53.334
"a point or an entire
half-line doesn't matter.",00:54:53.334,00:54:55.440
"So if you try to
look at your data",00:54:59.170,00:55:01.200
"and just put the data itself
into your hypothesis testing",00:55:01.200,00:55:05.520
"problem, then you're failing
the statistical principle.",00:55:05.520,00:55:10.745
"And that's what
people are doing.",00:55:10.745,00:55:12.120
"I mean, how can I check?",00:55:12.120,00:55:13.572
"I mean, of course,
here, it's going",00:55:13.572,00:55:15.030
"to be pretty blatant
if you publish",00:55:15.030,00:55:16.488
a paper that looks like this.,00:55:16.488,00:55:17.820
"But there's ways to
do it differently.",00:55:17.820,00:55:19.650
"For example, one way to
do it is to just do mult--",00:55:19.650,00:55:21.734
"so typically, what
people do is they",00:55:21.734,00:55:23.233
do multiple hypothesis testing.,00:55:23.233,00:55:24.780
"They're doing 100
tests at a time.",00:55:24.780,00:55:27.570
"Then you have random
fluctuations every time.",00:55:27.570,00:55:30.714
"And so they just
pick the one that",00:55:30.714,00:55:32.130
"has the random fluctuations
that go their way.",00:55:32.130,00:55:34.422
"I mean, sometimes it's
going in your way,",00:55:34.422,00:55:36.130
"and sometimes it's
going the opposite way,",00:55:36.130,00:55:37.879
"so you just pick the
one that works for you.",00:55:37.879,00:55:39.780
"We'll talk about multiple
hypothesis testing soon",00:55:39.780,00:55:41.990
"if you want to increase
your publication count.",00:55:41.990,00:55:44.860
There's actually papers--,00:55:49.779,00:55:50.820
"I think it was a big
news that some papers,",00:55:50.820,00:55:53.040
"I think, in psychology
or psychometrics",00:55:53.040,00:55:54.720
"papers that actually refused
to publish p-values now.",00:55:54.720,00:55:57.900
Where were we?,00:56:03.630,00:56:05.880
Here's the golden rule.,00:56:05.880,00:56:07.230
"So one thing that I like
to show is this thing,",00:56:07.230,00:56:11.970
"just so you know how you
apply the golden rule",00:56:11.970,00:56:14.340
"and how you apply
the standard tests.",00:56:14.340,00:56:16.050
"So the standard paradigm
is the following.",00:56:16.050,00:56:25.450
"You have a black box,
which is your test.",00:56:25.450,00:56:29.430
"For my wife, this is the
4th floor of the building.",00:56:29.430,00:56:32.230
"That's where the
statisticians sit.",00:56:32.230,00:56:33.840
What she sends there is data--,00:56:33.840,00:56:35.980

one is about toothpaste,",00:56:41.140,00:56:43.870

let's say 5%.,00:56:45.190,00:56:47.220
"What the 4th floor brings
back is that answer-- yes,",00:56:47.220,00:56:50.890
"no, green, red, just an answer.",00:56:50.890,00:56:53.290
So that's the standard testing.,00:56:58.050,00:56:59.670
"You just feed it the data
and the level at which you",00:56:59.670,00:57:02.040
"want to perform the
test, maybe asymptotic,",00:57:02.040,00:57:04.330
"and it spits out
a yes, no answer.",00:57:04.330,00:57:06.580
"What p-value does, you just
feed it the data itself.",00:57:06.580,00:57:15.340
"And what it spits
out is the p-value.",00:57:18.380,00:57:22.210
And now it's just up to you.,00:57:22.210,00:57:23.870
"I mean, hopefully your brain
has the computational power",00:57:23.870,00:57:27.910
"of deciding whether a number
is larger or smaller than 5%",00:57:27.910,00:57:31.090
"without having to call
a statistician for this.",00:57:31.090,00:57:33.790
And that's what it does.,00:57:33.790,00:57:35.360
So now we're on 1 scale.,00:57:35.360,00:57:37.600
"Now, I see some of you nodding
when I talk about p-hacking,",00:57:37.600,00:57:41.500
"so that means you've
seen p-values.",00:57:41.500,00:57:43.095
"If you've seen more than
100 p-values in your life,",00:57:43.095,00:57:45.220
you have an entire scale.,00:57:45.220,00:57:47.330
"A good p-value is less
than 10 to the minus 4.",00:57:47.330,00:57:50.770
That's the ultimate sweet spot.,00:57:50.770,00:57:53.440
"Actually, statistical
software spits out",00:57:53.440,00:57:56.830
"an output which says less
than 10 to the minus 4.",00:57:56.830,00:58:01.370
"But then maybe
you want a p-val--",00:58:01.370,00:58:02.830
"if you tell me my p-value
was 4.65, then I will say,",00:58:05.870,00:58:08.960
"you've been doing some
p-hacking until you found",00:58:08.960,00:58:10.970
a number that was below 5%.,00:58:10.970,00:58:12.680
"That's typically
what people will do.",00:58:12.680,00:58:14.660
But if you tell me--,00:58:14.660,00:58:16.590
"if you're doing the
test, if you're saying,",00:58:16.590,00:58:18.800
"I published my
result, my test at 5%",00:58:18.800,00:58:21.590
"said yes, that means that
maybe you're p-value was 4.99,",00:58:21.590,00:58:27.020
"or you're p-value was 10 to
the minus 4, I will never know.",00:58:27.020,00:58:29.762
"I will never know
how much evidence",00:58:29.762,00:58:31.220
you had against the null.,00:58:31.220,00:58:34.310
"But if you tell me
what the p-value is,",00:58:34.310,00:58:36.260
I can make my own decision.,00:58:36.260,00:58:37.492
"I don't have to tell me
whether it's a yes, no.",00:58:37.492,00:58:39.450
"You tell me it's 4.99, I'm
going to say, well, maybe yes,",00:58:39.450,00:58:42.620
"but I'm going to take
it with a grain of salt.",00:58:42.620,00:58:45.120
"And so that's why p-values are
good numbers to have in mind.",00:58:45.120,00:58:48.100
"Now, I should, as if it
was like an old trick",00:58:48.100,00:58:51.940
"that you start mastering
when you're 45 years old.",00:58:51.940,00:58:54.310
"No, it's just, how small is
the number between 0 and 1?",00:58:54.310,00:58:57.490
"That's really what
you need to know.",00:58:57.490,00:59:00.670
"Maybe on the log scale--
if it's 10 to the minus 1,",00:59:00.670,00:59:03.385
"10 to the minus 2, 10 to
the minus 3, et cetera--",00:59:03.385,00:59:07.240
"that's probably the extent
of the mastery here.",00:59:07.240,00:59:09.790
"So this traditional standard
paradigm that I showed",00:59:12.820,00:59:16.420
"is actually commonly referred to
as the Neyman-Pearson paradigm.",00:59:16.420,00:59:21.160
"So here, it says name
Neyman-Pearson's theory,",00:59:21.160,00:59:23.320
"so there's an entire
theory that comes with it.",00:59:23.320,00:59:25.970
But it's really a paradigm.,00:59:25.970,00:59:27.130
"It's a way of thinking about
hypothesis testing that",00:59:27.130,00:59:29.296
"says, well, if I'm not going
to be able to optimize both",00:59:29.296,00:59:32.530
"my type I and type II
error, I'm actually",00:59:32.530,00:59:34.750
"going to lock in my type
I error below some level",00:59:34.750,00:59:37.780
"and just minimize the type II
error under this constraint.",00:59:37.780,00:59:42.550
"That's what the
Neyman-Pearson paradigm is.",00:59:42.550,00:59:45.100
"And it sort of makes sense for
hypothesis testing problems.",00:59:45.100,00:59:48.490
"Now, if you were doing
some other applications",00:59:48.490,00:59:50.560
"with multi-objective
optimization,",00:59:50.560,00:59:52.210
"you would maybe come up
with something different.",00:59:52.210,00:59:54.310
"For example, machine learning
is not performing typically",00:59:54.310,00:59:58.600
under Neyman-Pearson paradigm.,00:59:58.600,01:00:01.120
"So if you do spam filtering,
you could say, well,",01:00:01.120,01:00:05.360
"I want to constrain the
probability as much as I can",01:00:05.360,01:00:08.650
"of taking somebody's
important emails",01:00:08.650,01:00:10.810
"and throwing them out as spam,
and under this constraint,",01:00:10.810,01:00:14.590
"not send too much
spam to that person.",01:00:14.590,01:00:17.350
"That sort of makes
sense for spams.",01:00:17.350,01:00:19.290
"Now, if you're labeling cats
versus dogs, that's probably",01:00:19.290,01:00:23.620
"not like you want to make
sure that no more than 5%",01:00:23.620,01:00:27.100
"of the dogs are labeled
cat because, I mean,",01:00:27.100,01:00:30.670
it doesn't matter.,01:00:30.670,01:00:31.469
"So what you typically
do is, you just",01:00:31.469,01:00:33.010
"sum up the two types
of errors you can make,",01:00:33.010,01:00:34.810
"and you minimize the sum
without putting any more",01:00:34.810,01:00:36.851
weight on one or the other.,01:00:36.851,01:00:38.260
"So here's an example where doing
a binary decision, one or two",01:00:38.260,01:00:42.880
"of the errors you
can make, you don't",01:00:42.880,01:00:45.070
have to actually be like that.,01:00:45.070,01:00:47.840
"So this example here, I did not.",01:00:47.840,01:00:50.300
"The trivial test psi is
equal to 0, what was it",01:00:50.300,01:00:55.200

What is psi equals 0?,01:01:00.350,01:01:03.530
"That was concluding

That's the status quo.,01:01:10.388,01:01:11.340
"So that means that this
guy never rejects h0.",01:01:11.340,01:01:14.790
Everybody's going away free.,01:01:14.790,01:01:16.910
"So you're sure
you're not actually",01:01:16.910,01:01:18.800
"going against the constitution
because alpha is 0%, which",01:01:18.800,01:01:25.250
is certainly less than 5%.,01:01:25.250,01:01:26.940
"But the power, the fact
that a lot of criminals",01:01:26.940,01:01:30.260
"go back outside

"is actually formulated in
terms of low power, which,",01:01:34.130,01:01:37.580
"in this case, is actually 0.",01:01:37.580,01:01:39.100
"Again, the power is the
number between 0 and 1.",01:01:39.100,01:01:41.690
"Close to 0, good.",01:01:41.690,01:01:43.100
"Close to 1, bad.",01:01:43.100,01:01:45.227
"Now, what is the
definition of the p-value?",01:01:45.227,01:01:51.510
"That's going to be
something-- it's a mouthful.",01:01:51.510,01:01:54.300
"The definition of the
p-value is a mouthful.",01:01:54.300,01:01:58.520
It's the tipping point.,01:01:58.520,01:02:00.240

which blah, blah, blah, blah,",01:02:00.240,01:02:02.620
blah.,01:02:02.620,01:02:03.120
It's complicated to remember it.,01:02:03.120,01:02:05.410
"Now, I think that my 6th
explanation, my wife,",01:02:05.410,01:02:09.910
"after saying, oh, so it's the
probability of making an error,",01:02:09.910,01:02:12.994
"I said, yeah, that's the
probability of making",01:02:12.994,01:02:14.910
"an error because,
of course, she can",01:02:14.910,01:02:16.870
"think probability of making an
error small, good, large, bad.",01:02:16.870,01:02:22.270
"So that's actually a
good way to remember.",01:02:22.270,01:02:24.940
"I'm pretty sure
that at least 50%",01:02:24.940,01:02:26.521
"of people who are using
p-values out there",01:02:26.521,01:02:28.270
"think that the p-value is the
probability of making an error.",01:02:28.270,01:02:31.220
"Now, for all
matters of purposes,",01:02:31.220,01:02:33.040
"if your goal is to just
threshold the p-value,",01:02:33.040,01:02:35.620
this is OK to have this in y.,01:02:35.620,01:02:37.900
"But when comes, at
least until December 22,",01:02:37.900,01:02:42.220
"I would recommend trying
to actually memorize",01:02:42.220,01:02:44.830
"the right definition
for the p-value.",01:02:44.830,01:02:46.780
"So the idea, again,
is fix the level",01:02:53.020,01:02:55.240
and try to optimize the power.,01:02:55.240,01:02:57.112
"So we're going to try to compute
some p-values from now on.",01:03:01.360,01:03:05.370
How do you compute the p-value?,01:03:05.370,01:03:06.900
"Well, you can actually see it
from this picture over there.",01:03:06.900,01:03:10.670
"One thing I didn't show
on this picture-- so here,",01:03:14.047,01:03:16.130
"it was my q alpha over
2 that had alpha here,",01:03:16.130,01:03:19.010
alpha over 2 here.,01:03:19.010,01:03:21.230
That was my q alpha over 2.,01:03:21.230,01:03:22.580
"And I said, if tn is to
the right of this guy,",01:03:22.580,01:03:26.870
I'm going to reject.,01:03:26.870,01:03:27.746
"If tn is to the
left of this guy,",01:03:27.746,01:03:29.120
I'm going to fail to reject.,01:03:29.120,01:03:31.550
"Pictorially, you can actually
represent the p-value.",01:03:31.550,01:03:34.720
"It's when I replace
this guy by tn itself.",01:03:34.720,01:03:36.770
"Sorry, that's p-value over 2.",01:03:41.170,01:03:44.770
"No, actually, that's p-value.",01:03:44.770,01:03:47.360
"So let me just keep it like
that and put the absolute value",01:03:47.360,01:03:51.290
here.,01:03:51.290,01:03:51.790
"So if you replace the role of
q alpha over 2, by your test",01:03:54.530,01:03:58.560
"statistic, the area
under the curve",01:03:58.560,01:04:01.630
"is actually the
p-value itself up",01:04:01.630,01:04:03.160
"to a scale because of
the symmetric thing.",01:04:03.160,01:04:06.730
"So there's a good way
to see, pictorially,",01:04:06.730,01:04:09.280
what the p-value is.,01:04:09.280,01:04:10.930
"It's just the probability
that some Gaussians--",01:04:10.930,01:04:13.750
"it's just the probability that
some absolute value of n01",01:04:13.750,01:04:17.680
exceeds tn.,01:04:17.680,01:04:18.370
That's what the p-value is.,01:04:22.480,01:04:24.384
"Now, this guy has nothing
to do with this guy,",01:04:24.384,01:04:26.300
"so this is really just 1
minus the Gaussian cdf of tn,",01:04:26.300,01:04:32.680
and that's it.,01:04:32.680,01:04:34.650
"So that's how I would
compute p-values.",01:04:34.650,01:04:36.460
"Now, as I said, the
p-value is a beauty",01:04:36.460,01:04:40.210
"because you don't
have to understand",01:04:40.210,01:04:43.330
"the fact that your limiting
distribution is a Gaussian.",01:04:43.330,01:04:47.050
"It's already factored
in this construction.",01:04:47.050,01:04:49.264
"The fact that I'm
actually looking",01:04:49.264,01:04:50.680
"at this cumulative distribution
function of a standard Gaussian",01:04:50.680,01:04:54.880
"makes my p-value
automatically adjust to what",01:04:54.880,01:04:57.302
the limiting distribution is.,01:04:57.302,01:04:58.510
"And if this was the
cumulative distribution",01:04:58.510,01:05:00.460
"function of a
exponential, I would just",01:05:00.460,01:05:03.520
"have a different function here
denoted by f, for example,",01:05:03.520,01:05:06.055
"and I would just compute
a different value.",01:05:06.055,01:05:07.866
"But in the end, regardless of
what the limiting value is,",01:05:07.866,01:05:10.240
"my p-value would still be
a number between 0 and 1.",01:05:10.240,01:05:13.540
"And so to illustrate
that, let's look",01:05:13.540,01:05:16.650
"at other weird distributions
that we could get in place",01:05:16.650,01:05:20.340
of the standard Gaussian.,01:05:20.340,01:05:22.620
"And we're not going to see
many, but we'll see one.",01:05:22.620,01:05:24.980
"And it's not called the
chi squared distribution.",01:05:24.980,01:05:27.311
"It's actually called the
Student's distribution,",01:05:27.311,01:05:29.310
"but it involves the chi
squared distribution",01:05:29.310,01:05:31.920
as a building block.,01:05:31.920,01:05:34.320
"So I don't know if my phonetics
are not really right there,",01:05:34.320,01:05:38.820
"so I try to say, well,
it's chi squared.",01:05:38.820,01:05:43.050
"Maybe it's ""kee"" squared
above, in Canada, who knows.",01:05:43.050,01:05:47.190
"So for a positive integer,
so there's only 1 parameter.",01:05:47.190,01:05:50.589
"So for the Gaussian,
you have 2 parameters,",01:05:50.589,01:05:52.380
which are mu and sigma squared.,01:05:52.380,01:05:54.180

"Here, I have 1
integer parameter.",01:05:57.090,01:05:59.280

squared distribution",01:06:03.030,01:06:05.160
with d degrees of freedom--,01:06:05.160,01:06:07.642
"so the parameter is called
a degree of freedom,",01:06:07.642,01:06:09.600
"just like mu is called the
expected value and sigma",01:06:09.600,01:06:11.700
squared is called the variance.,01:06:11.700,01:06:12.600

degrees of freedom.",01:06:12.600,01:06:14.370

really understand why.",01:06:14.370,01:06:17.290

that you would get--",01:06:17.290,01:06:19.800
"that's the random
variable you would",01:06:19.800,01:06:21.300

squares of independent standard",01:06:21.300,01:06:26.260

probability density function.",01:06:40.740,01:06:46.960
"I mean, after all,
this is the sum",01:06:46.960,01:06:49.150
"of positive random
variables, so it",01:06:49.150,01:06:51.730
is a positive random variable.,01:06:51.730,01:06:53.800
"It has a density on
the positive real line.",01:06:53.800,01:06:56.680
"And the pdf of chi squared with
d degrees of freedom is what?",01:06:56.680,01:07:03.420
"Well, it's fd of x is--",01:07:03.420,01:07:07.900
"what is it?-- x to the d/2
minus 1 e to the minus x/2.",01:07:07.900,01:07:13.930
"And then here, I
have a gamma of d/2.",01:07:13.930,01:07:16.510
"And the other one is, I
think, 2 to the d/2 minus 1.",01:07:16.510,01:07:20.470
"No, 2 to the d/2.",01:07:23.158,01:07:26.530
That's what it is.,01:07:26.530,01:07:28.690
That's the density.,01:07:28.690,01:07:30.580
"If you are very
good at probability,",01:07:30.580,01:07:32.110
"you can make the
change of variable",01:07:32.110,01:07:33.640
"and write your Jacobian
and do all this stuff",01:07:33.640,01:07:35.789
"and actually check
that this is true.",01:07:35.789,01:07:37.330
I do not recommend doing that.,01:07:37.330,01:07:40.540
"So this is the density, but it's
better understood like that.",01:07:40.540,01:07:44.070
"I think it was just
something that you",01:07:44.070,01:07:46.270
built from standard Gaussian.,01:07:46.270,01:07:48.160
"So for example, an
example of a chi",01:07:48.160,01:07:50.800
"squared with 2
degrees of freedom",01:07:50.800,01:07:52.870
is actually the following thing.,01:07:52.870,01:07:54.790
"Let's assume I have
a target like this.",01:07:54.790,01:07:56.860
And I don't aim very well.,01:08:00.170,01:08:02.960
"And I'm trying to
hit the center.",01:08:02.960,01:08:05.996
"And I'm not going
to have, maybe,",01:08:05.996,01:08:07.370
"a deviation, which is
standard Gaussian left, right",01:08:07.370,01:08:10.380
"and standard Gaussian
north, south.",01:08:10.380,01:08:16.520
"So I'm throwing,
and then I'm here,",01:08:16.520,01:08:18.710
"and I'm claiming that this
number here, by Pythagoras",01:08:18.710,01:08:22.279
"theorem, the square
distance here",01:08:22.279,01:08:24.290
"is the sum of this
square distance",01:08:24.290,01:08:25.790
"here, which is the square
of a Gaussian by assumption.",01:08:25.790,01:08:30.060
"This is plus the square
of this distance,",01:08:30.060,01:08:31.854
"which is the square of
another independent Gaussian.",01:08:31.854,01:08:34.020
I assume those are independent.,01:08:34.020,01:08:35.486
"And so the square distance
from this point to this point",01:08:35.486,01:08:37.819
"is the chi squared with
2 degrees of freedom.",01:08:37.819,01:08:40.580
So this guy here is n01 squared.,01:08:40.580,01:08:45.029
This is n01 squared.,01:08:45.029,01:08:48.140
"And so this guy here,
this distance here,",01:08:48.140,01:08:50.120
"is chi squared with
2 degrees of freedom.",01:08:50.120,01:08:53.285
I mean the square distance.,01:08:53.285,01:08:54.410
"I'm talking about
square distances here.",01:08:54.410,01:08:58.569
"So now you can see that,
actually, Pythagoras",01:08:58.569,01:09:02.380
"is basically why chi
squared [? arrives. ?]",01:09:02.380,01:09:05.899
That's why it has its own name.,01:09:05.899,01:09:07.810
"I mean, I could define
this random variable.",01:09:07.810,01:09:10.479
"I mean, it's actually
a gamma distribution.",01:09:10.479,01:09:13.075
"It's a special case of something
called the gamma distribution.",01:09:13.075,01:09:15.700
"The fact that the special
case has its own name",01:09:15.700,01:09:17.658
"is because there's
many times what",01:09:17.658,01:09:19.075
"we're going to
take sum of squares",01:09:19.075,01:09:20.491
"of independent Gaussians because
Gaussians, the sum of squares",01:09:20.491,01:09:23.140
"is really the norm, the
Euclidean norm squared,",01:09:23.140,01:09:25.330
just by Pythagoras theorem.,01:09:25.330,01:09:26.830
"If I'm in higher
dimension, I can",01:09:26.830,01:09:28.319
"start to sum more
squared coordinates,",01:09:28.319,01:09:30.370
"and I'm going to measure
the norm squared.",01:09:30.370,01:09:32.119
"So if you want to draw this
picture, it looks like this.",01:09:34.240,01:09:37.880
"Again, it's the sum
of positive numbers,",01:09:37.880,01:09:39.620
"so it's going to be
on 0 plus infinity.",01:09:39.620,01:09:43.000
That's fd.,01:09:43.000,01:09:44.680
"And so f1 looks like
this, f2 looks like this.",01:09:44.680,01:09:52.850
"So the tails become heavier
and heavier as d increases.",01:09:52.850,01:09:57.370
"And then at [INAUDIBLE]
to 3, it starts",01:09:57.370,01:10:00.560
to have a different shape.,01:10:00.560,01:10:01.960
"It starts from 0 and
it looks like this.",01:10:01.960,01:10:04.210
"And then, as d
increases, it's basically",01:10:04.210,01:10:06.850
"as if you were to push
this thing to the right.",01:10:06.850,01:10:09.210
"It's just like, psh, so it's
just falling like a big blob.",01:10:09.210,01:10:14.979
Everybody sees what's going on?,01:10:14.979,01:10:16.270
"So there's just this fat
thing that's just going there.",01:10:16.270,01:10:19.637
"What is the expected
value of a chi squared?",01:10:19.637,01:10:21.470
"So it's the expected
value of the sum",01:10:28.670,01:10:30.900
"of Gaussian random
variables, squared.",01:10:30.900,01:10:37.938
I know I said that.,01:10:37.938,01:10:40.358
"AUDIENCE: So it's the sum of
their second moments, right?",01:10:40.358,01:10:42.790
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Which is?,01:10:42.790,01:10:43.956
Those are n01.,01:10:46.240,01:10:47.570
"AUDIENCE: It's
like-- oh, I see, 1.",01:10:47.570,01:10:50.386
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.,01:10:50.386,01:10:51.386
"AUDIENCE: So n times
1 or d times 1.",01:10:51.386,01:10:53.294
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Yeah, which is d.",01:10:53.294,01:10:55.070
"So one thing you
can check quickly",01:10:55.070,01:10:56.990
"is that the expected value
of a chi squared is d.",01:10:56.990,01:11:00.280
"And so you see, that's why the
mass is shifting to the right",01:11:00.280,01:11:04.280
as d increases.,01:11:04.280,01:11:05.240
It's just going there.,01:11:05.240,01:11:06.350
"Actually, the variance
is also increasing.",01:11:06.350,01:11:08.320
The variance is 2d.,01:11:08.320,01:11:10.180
So this is one thing.,01:11:14.070,01:11:16.130
"And so why do we
care about this?",01:11:16.130,01:11:19.230
"In basic statistics,
it's not like we actually",01:11:19.230,01:11:22.640
"have statistics much
about throwing darts",01:11:22.640,01:11:25.140
at high-dimensional boards.,01:11:25.140,01:11:28.590
"So what's happening is that if
I look at the sample variance,",01:11:28.590,01:11:31.380
"the average of the sum of
squared centered by their mean,",01:11:31.380,01:11:36.590
"then I can actually
expend this as the sum",01:11:36.590,01:11:38.480
"of the squares minus
the average squared",01:11:38.480,01:11:42.320
"It's just the same
trick that we have",01:11:42.320,01:11:44.680
"for the variance-- second moment
minus first moment square.",01:11:44.680,01:11:49.360
"And then I claim that
Cochran's theorem--",01:11:49.360,01:11:53.785
"and I will tell you in a second
what Cochran's theorem tells me",01:11:53.785,01:11:56.640
"is that this sample
variance is actually--",01:11:56.640,01:11:58.390
so if I had only this--,01:11:58.390,01:12:01.330
look at those guys.,01:12:01.330,01:12:04.560
"Those guys are Gaussian
with mean mu and variance",01:12:04.560,01:12:07.170
sigma squared.,01:12:07.170,01:12:08.370
"Think for 1 second mu being
0 and sigma squared being 1.",01:12:08.370,01:12:13.290
"Now, this part would be a
chi squared with n degrees",01:12:13.290,01:12:16.920
of freedom divided by n.,01:12:16.920,01:12:19.162
"Now I get another
thing here, which",01:12:19.162,01:12:21.300
"is the square of something that
looks like a Gaussian as well.",01:12:21.300,01:12:24.850
"So it looks like I have
something else here, which",01:12:24.850,01:12:27.750
looks also like a chi squared.,01:12:27.750,01:12:29.580
"Now, Cochran's theorem is
essentially telling you",01:12:29.580,01:12:31.890
"that those things
are independent,",01:12:31.890,01:12:35.130
"and so that in a way, you can
think of those guys as being,",01:12:35.130,01:12:39.720
"here, n degrees of freedom
minus 1 degree of freedom.",01:12:39.720,01:12:43.780
"Now, here, as I said, this
does not mean 0 and variance 1.",01:12:43.780,01:12:47.820
"The fact that it's not
mean 0 is not a problem",01:12:47.820,01:12:50.730
"because I can remove the mean
here and remove the mean here.",01:12:50.730,01:12:54.790
"And so this thing has
the same distribution,",01:12:54.790,01:12:57.130
"regardless of what
the actual mean is.",01:12:57.130,01:12:59.100
"So without loss of
generality, I can",01:12:59.100,01:13:00.600
assume that mu is equal to 0.,01:13:00.600,01:13:02.097
"Now, the variance, I'm
going to have to pay,",01:13:02.097,01:13:03.930
"because if I multiply
all these numbers by 10,",01:13:03.930,01:13:06.660
"then this sn is going
to multiplied by 100.",01:13:06.660,01:13:09.647
"So this thing is going to
scale with the variance.",01:13:09.647,01:13:11.730
"And not surprisingly, it's
scaling like the square",01:13:11.730,01:13:13.813
of the variance.,01:13:13.813,01:13:15.550
"So if I look at sn,
it's distributed",01:13:15.550,01:13:18.120
"as sigma squared
times the chi squared",01:13:18.120,01:13:21.960
"with n minus 1 degrees
of freedom divided by n.",01:13:21.960,01:13:25.060
"And we don't really write
that, because a chi squared",01:13:25.060,01:13:28.230
"times sigma squared divided
by n is not a distribution,",01:13:28.230,01:13:30.650
"so we put everything
to the left,",01:13:30.650,01:13:32.292
"and we say that this is
actually a chi squared with n",01:13:32.292,01:13:34.500
minus 1 degrees of freedom.,01:13:34.500,01:13:36.880
"So here, I'm actually
dropping a fact on you,",01:13:36.880,01:13:40.570
"but you can see
the building block.",01:13:40.570,01:13:43.810
"What is the thing that's
fuzzy at this point,",01:13:43.810,01:13:46.750
"but the rest should be
crystal clear to you?",01:13:46.750,01:13:48.820
"The thing that's fuzzy is
that removing this squared guy",01:13:48.820,01:13:52.060
"here is actually removing
1 degree of freedom.",01:13:52.060,01:13:55.770
"That should be weird, but that's
what Cochran's theorem tells.",01:13:55.770,01:13:59.122
"It's essentially
stating something",01:13:59.122,01:14:00.800
"about orthogonality of
subspaces with the span",01:14:00.800,01:14:04.760
"of the constant vector,
something like that.",01:14:04.760,01:14:07.580
"So you don't have to
think about it too much,",01:14:07.580,01:14:09.770
but that's what it's telling me.,01:14:09.770,01:14:11.630
"But the rest, if you plug in--
so the scaling in sigma squared",01:14:11.630,01:14:15.170
"and in n, so that should
be completely clear to you.",01:14:15.170,01:14:18.450
"So in particular, if
I remove that part,",01:14:18.450,01:14:20.810
"it should be clear to you
that this thing, if mean is 0,",01:14:20.810,01:14:24.950
"this thing is
actually distributed.",01:14:24.950,01:14:27.240
"Well, if mu is 0, what is
the distribution of this guy?",01:14:27.240,01:14:30.153
"So I remove that
part, just this part.",01:14:35.810,01:14:37.739
"So I have xi, which
are n0 sigma squared.",01:14:46.840,01:14:50.700
"And I'm asking, what is the
distribution of 1/n sum from i",01:14:50.700,01:14:53.505
equal 1 to n of xi squared?,01:14:53.505,01:14:57.382
So it is the sum of their IID.,01:14:57.382,01:15:00.350
"So it's the sum of independent
Gaussians, but not standard.",01:15:00.350,01:15:03.620
"So the first thing
to make them standard",01:15:03.620,01:15:05.300
"is that I divide all of
them by sigma squared.",01:15:05.300,01:15:07.450
"Now, this guy is of the form
zi squared where zi is n01.",01:15:10.690,01:15:17.050
"So now, this thing here
has what distribution?",01:15:20.710,01:15:25.740
AUDIENCE: Chi squared n.,01:15:25.740,01:15:27.420
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Chi squared n.",01:15:27.420,01:15:30.198
"And now, sigma squared over
n times chi squared n--",01:15:30.198,01:15:33.450
"so if I have sigma squared
divided by n times chi",01:15:33.450,01:15:35.940
squared--,01:15:35.940,01:15:37.830
"sorry, so n times n
divided by sigma squared.",01:15:37.830,01:15:41.970
"So if I take this
thing and I multiply it",01:15:41.970,01:15:45.570
"by n divided by sigma squared,
it means I remove this term,",01:15:45.570,01:15:48.360
"and now I am left
with a chi squared",01:15:48.360,01:15:49.860
with n degrees of freedom.,01:15:49.860,01:15:51.130
"Now, the effect of centering
with the sample mean here",01:15:51.130,01:15:55.320
"is only to lose 1
degree of freedom.",01:15:55.320,01:15:57.450
That's it.,01:15:57.450,01:15:58.108
"So if I want to do a test
about variance, since this",01:16:01.460,01:16:05.210
"is supposedly a good
estimator of variance,",01:16:05.210,01:16:08.000
"this could be my
pivotal distribution.",01:16:08.000,01:16:10.880
"This could play the
role of a Gaussian.",01:16:10.880,01:16:12.710
"If I want to know if my variance
is equal to 1 or larger than 1,",01:16:12.710,01:16:16.100

based on this only statement",01:16:16.100,01:16:21.720
"and test if the variance
is larger than 1 or not.",01:16:21.720,01:16:23.910
"Now, this is not
asymptotic because I",01:16:23.910,01:16:25.451

assumption that my data was",01:16:25.451,01:16:28.470
Gaussian itself.,01:16:28.470,01:16:29.160

remark-- you can",01:16:32.390,01:16:33.830

2 is an exponential with 1/2",01:16:33.830,01:16:37.220

2 degrees of freedom.",01:16:42.350,01:16:44.690

sum of the square",01:16:44.690,01:16:46.440

is actually an exponential.",01:16:46.440,01:16:50.540
"That's not super clear, right?",01:16:50.540,01:16:53.140

at what was here--",01:16:53.140,01:17:00.260

but let me rewrite it for you.",01:17:00.260,01:17:03.430
"So it was x to the d/2 minus
1 e to the minus x/2 divided",01:17:03.430,01:17:08.760
by 2 to the d/2 gamma of d/2.,01:17:08.760,01:17:14.470
"So if I plug in d is
equal to 2, gamma of 2/2",01:17:14.470,01:17:18.200
"is gamma of 1, which is 1.",01:17:18.200,01:17:21.920
It's factorial of 0.,01:17:21.920,01:17:23.750
"So it's 1, so this
guy goes away.",01:17:23.750,01:17:26.290
"2 to the d/2 is 2 to
1, so that's just 1.",01:17:26.290,01:17:33.310
"No, that's just 2.",01:17:33.310,01:17:36.490
"Then x the d/2 minus 1
is x the 0, goes away.",01:17:36.490,01:17:40.990
"And so I have x minus x/2
1/2, which is really, indeed,",01:17:40.990,01:17:47.080
"of the form lambda e
to the minus lambda",01:17:47.080,01:17:50.050
"x for lambda is equal
to 1/2, which was",01:17:50.050,01:17:53.290
our exponential distribution.,01:17:53.290,01:17:54.851
"Well, next week is,
well, Columbus Day?",01:17:59.200,01:18:05.290
So not next Monday--,01:18:05.290,01:18:08.510
"so next week, we'll talk
about Student's distribution.",01:18:08.510,01:18:12.310
"And so that was
discovered by a guy",01:18:12.310,01:18:15.430
"who pretended his name was
Student, but was not Student.",01:18:15.430,01:18:19.400
"And I challenge you to
find why in the meantime.",01:18:19.400,01:18:23.260
So I'll see you next week.,01:18:23.260,01:18:24.940
"Your homework is
going to be outside",01:18:24.940,01:18:28.090
so we can release the room.,01:18:28.090,01:18:31.733
