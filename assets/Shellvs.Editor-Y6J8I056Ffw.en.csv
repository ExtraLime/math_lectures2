"ANA BELL: So the question was,
if you have these two lines",00:00:22.640,00:00:27.877
"right here-- which I'll
just put them up here just",00:00:27.877,00:00:29.960
"so it's bigger--
type(5), print(3.0-1),",00:00:29.960,00:00:34.570
"what is going to be the output,
so if I run this in the editor?",00:00:34.570,00:00:38.060
"So for these types of problems,
you can always check yourself.",00:00:38.060,00:00:40.842
"And this comes back to, if
you're new to programming,",00:00:40.842,00:00:43.050
don't be afraid to try it out.,00:00:43.050,00:00:44.300
Don't ask me.,00:00:44.300,00:00:44.850
Don't ask your neighbor.,00:00:44.850,00:00:46.580
"Just type it into the
shell and hit Run.",00:00:46.580,00:00:49.160
"And then you get to
see what the answer is.",00:00:49.160,00:00:51.570
"So the answer to this
question is going to be 2.0.",00:00:51.570,00:00:55.250
"And let's see, are we right?",00:00:55.250,00:00:57.260
"Yeah, great.",00:00:57.260,00:00:58.280
75% of the people got it right.,00:00:58.280,00:01:01.449
Perfect.,00:01:01.449,00:01:01.948
"So if you didn't get it
right, just to explain again,",00:01:04.819,00:01:07.860
"the reason why this
doesn't get printed out",00:01:07.860,00:01:10.040
"is because we never actually
had a print statement.",00:01:10.040,00:01:14.670
"So if you want to show
something to the console,",00:01:14.670,00:01:16.910

print statement.",00:01:16.910,00:01:19.050
