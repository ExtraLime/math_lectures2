"If you take the average
of a bunch of numbers,",00:01:03.840,00:01:08.300
that looks like this.,00:01:08.300,00:01:10.420
"And we can view this as
sampling a function.",00:01:10.420,00:01:15.500

the continuous average.",00:01:25.070,00:01:32.960
"So this guy is the continuous
average.",00:01:32.960,00:01:43.550
Or just the average of f.,00:01:43.550,00:01:49.270
"And I want to explain that, just
to make sure that we're",00:01:49.270,00:01:53.490
all on the same page.,00:01:53.490,00:01:56.380
"In general, if you have a
function and you want to",00:01:56.380,00:01:59.530
"interpret the integral, our
first interpretation was that",00:01:59.530,00:02:03.770
"it's something like the
area under the curve.",00:02:03.770,00:02:09.860
"But average value is another
reasonable interpretation.",00:02:09.860,00:02:15.440
"Namely, if you take equally
spaced points here, starting",00:02:15.440,00:02:20.450

y1, which = f ( x1),",00:02:28.520,00:02:34.320
"y2, which = f ( x2), all the way
up to yn, which = f ( xn).",00:02:34.320,00:02:43.040

that we're talking",00:02:43.040,00:02:46.190
about is b - a / n.,00:02:46.190,00:02:50.690

"So I will divide
by b - a here.",00:03:38.850,00:03:42.000
And divide by b - a over here.,00:03:42.000,00:03:48.230
"And then I'll just check what
this thing actually is.",00:03:48.230,00:03:53.510
"Delta x / b - a, what
is that factor?",00:03:53.510,00:03:57.560
"Well, if we look over here to
what delta x is, if you divide",00:03:57.560,00:04:01.930
"by b - a, it's 1 / n.",00:04:01.930,00:04:07.040
"So the factor delta
x / b - a = 1 / n.",00:04:07.040,00:04:10.210
"That's what I put over here, the
sum of y1 through yn / n.",00:04:10.210,00:04:15.210
"And as this tends to
0, it's the same",00:04:15.210,00:04:18.860
as n going to infinity.,00:04:18.860,00:04:22.760
Those are the same things.,00:04:22.760,00:04:25.610
"The average value and
the integral are",00:04:25.610,00:04:27.450
very closely related.,00:04:27.450,00:04:28.460
"There's only this difference
that we're dividing by the",00:04:28.460,00:04:32.130
length of the interval.,00:04:32.130,00:04:36.440
"I want to give an example
which is an incredibly",00:04:36.440,00:04:38.810
"simpleminded one, but it'll
come into play later on.",00:04:38.810,00:04:41.800
"So let's take the example
of a constant.",00:04:41.800,00:04:47.040
"And this is, I hope, will make
you slightly less confused",00:04:47.040,00:04:50.730
about what I just wrote.,00:04:50.730,00:04:52.540
"As well as making you think that
this is as simpleminded",00:04:52.540,00:04:55.170
"and reasonable as
it should be.",00:04:55.170,00:04:57.370
"If I check what the average
value of this constant is,",00:04:57.370,00:05:00.310
"it's given by this relatively
complicated formula here.",00:05:00.310,00:05:04.680
"That is, I have to integrate
the function c.",00:05:04.680,00:05:07.170
"Well, it's just the
constant c.",00:05:07.170,00:05:09.570
"And however you do this, as an
antiderivative I was thinking",00:05:09.570,00:05:12.320
"of it as a rectangle, the answer
that you're going to",00:05:12.320,00:05:14.560
get is c here.,00:05:14.560,00:05:18.310
So work that out.,00:05:18.310,00:05:19.490
The answer is c.,00:05:19.490,00:05:20.730
"And so the fact that the average
of c = c, which had",00:05:20.730,00:05:26.320
"better be the case for averages,
explains the",00:05:26.320,00:05:30.280
denominator.,00:05:30.280,00:05:31.760
Explains the 1 / b - a there.,00:05:31.760,00:05:36.690
"That's cooked up exactly so that
the average of a constant",00:05:36.690,00:05:39.190
is what it's supposed to be.,00:05:39.190,00:05:40.230
"Otherwise we have the wrong
normalizing factor.",00:05:40.230,00:05:42.250
"We've clearly got a piece of
nonsense on our hands.",00:05:42.250,00:05:45.450
"And incidentally, it also
explains the 1 / n in the very",00:05:45.450,00:05:51.580
"first formula that
I wrote down.",00:05:51.580,00:05:53.460
"The reason why this is called
the average, or one reason why",00:05:53.460,00:05:56.380
"it's the right thing, is that if
you took the same constant",00:05:56.380,00:05:59.400
"c, for y all the way across
there n times, if you divide",00:05:59.400,00:06:02.020
"it by n, you get back c.",00:06:02.020,00:06:03.930
"That's what we mean by average
value and that's",00:06:03.930,00:06:05.770
why the n is there.,00:06:05.770,00:06:11.370
So that was an easy example.,00:06:11.370,00:06:14.960
"Now none of the examples that we
are going to give are going",00:06:14.960,00:06:17.830
to be all that complicated.,00:06:17.830,00:06:20.000
"But they will get sort of
steadily more sophisticated.",00:06:20.000,00:06:23.460
"The second example is going to
be the average height of a",00:06:23.460,00:06:35.930
point on a semicircle.,00:06:35.930,00:06:47.860
"And maybe I'll draw a picture of
the semicircle first here.",00:06:47.860,00:06:52.800
"And we'll just make
it the standard",00:06:52.800,00:06:54.930
"circle, the unit circle.",00:06:54.930,00:06:58.840
"So maybe I should have called
it a unit semicircle.",00:06:58.840,00:07:04.890
"This is the point negative
1, this is the point 1.",00:07:04.890,00:07:07.680
"And we're picking a point over
here and we're going to take",00:07:07.680,00:07:12.690
"the typical, or the average,
height here.",00:07:12.690,00:07:17.210
"Integrating with
respect to dx.",00:07:17.210,00:07:18.550
"So sort of continuously
with respect to dx.",00:07:18.550,00:07:21.770
"Well, what is that?",00:07:21.770,00:07:25.030
"Well, according to the rule,
it's 1 / b - a times - sorry,",00:07:25.030,00:07:29.380
it's up here in the box.,00:07:29.380,00:07:30.470
"1 / b - a, the interval from
a to b, f ( x) dx.",00:07:30.470,00:07:34.080
That's 1 / + 1 - (- 1).,00:07:34.080,00:07:39.460
"The integral from - 1 to 1,
square root of 1 - x ^2 dx.",00:07:39.460,00:07:45.240
"Right, because the height is y
= , this is y = the square",00:07:45.240,00:07:52.727
root of 1 - x^2.,00:07:52.727,00:07:57.260
"And to evaluate this is not as
difficult as it seems. This is",00:07:57.260,00:08:02.990
"1/2 times this quantity
here, which we can",00:08:02.990,00:08:06.950
interpret as an area.,00:08:06.950,00:08:08.940
"It's the area of
the semicircle.",00:08:08.940,00:08:12.520
"So this is the area of the
semicircle, which we know to",00:08:12.520,00:08:20.310
"be half the area
of the circle.",00:08:20.310,00:08:22.730
So it's pi / 2.,00:08:22.730,00:08:26.700
"And so the answer, here the
average height, is pi/ 4.",00:08:26.700,00:08:35.500
"Now, later in the class and
actually not in this unit,",00:08:35.500,00:08:38.670
"we'll actually be able
to calculate the",00:08:38.670,00:08:40.660
antiderivative of this.,00:08:40.660,00:08:42.910
"So in other words, we'll be
able to calculate this",00:08:42.910,00:08:44.440
analytically.,00:08:44.440,00:08:45.090
"For right now we just have the
geometric reason why the value",00:08:45.090,00:08:48.980
of this is pi / 2.,00:08:48.980,00:08:51.190
"And we'll do that in the fourth
unit when we do a lot",00:08:51.190,00:08:53.620
of techniques of integration.,00:08:53.620,00:08:57.140
So here's an example.,00:08:57.140,00:08:58.290
"Turns out, the average height
of this is pi / 4.",00:08:58.290,00:09:03.770
"Now, the next example that I
want to give introduces a",00:09:03.770,00:09:07.660
little bit of confusion.,00:09:07.660,00:09:09.440
"And I'm not going to resolve
this confusion completely, but",00:09:09.440,00:09:13.750
"I'm going to try to get
you used to it.",00:09:13.750,00:09:15.870
"I'm going to take the average
height again.",00:09:15.870,00:09:22.770
"But now, with respect
to arc length.",00:09:22.770,00:09:33.690
"Which is usually
denoted theta.",00:09:33.690,00:09:37.250
"Now, this brings
up an extremely",00:09:37.250,00:09:39.590
important feature of averages.,00:09:39.590,00:09:43.080
"Which is that you have to
specify the variable with",00:09:43.080,00:09:47.120
"respect to which the average
is taking place.",00:09:47.120,00:09:51.290
"And the answer will
be different",00:09:51.290,00:09:52.870
depending on the variable.,00:09:52.870,00:09:54.620
"So it's not going
to be the same.",00:09:54.620,00:09:56.060
"Wow, can't spell the
word length here.",00:09:56.060,00:09:58.130
"Just like the plural of
witches the last time.",00:09:58.130,00:10:02.230
We'll work on that.,00:10:02.230,00:10:03.150
"We'll fix all of our,
that's an ancient",00:10:03.150,00:10:10.190
"Gaelic word, I think.",00:10:10.190,00:10:11.410
Lengh.,00:10:11.410,00:10:16.560
"So now, let me show you that
it's not quite the same here.",00:10:16.560,00:10:22.190
"It's especially exaggerated if
maybe I shift this little",00:10:22.190,00:10:25.830
"interval dx over to the
right-hand end.",00:10:25.830,00:10:30.440
"And you can see that the
little portion that",00:10:30.440,00:10:32.450
"corresponds to it, which is
the d theta piece, has a",00:10:32.450,00:10:35.930
"different length from
the dx piece.",00:10:35.930,00:10:39.130
"And indeed, as you come down
here, these very short",00:10:39.130,00:10:41.620
"portions of dx length
have much longer",00:10:41.620,00:10:44.920
portions of theta length.,00:10:44.920,00:10:47.770
"So that the average that we're
taking when we do it with",00:10:47.770,00:10:51.760
"respect to theta, is going to
emphasize the low values more.",00:10:51.760,00:10:56.060
"They're going to be
more exaggerated.",00:10:56.060,00:10:58.090
"And the average should
be lower than the",00:10:58.090,00:11:02.080
average that we got here.,00:11:02.080,00:11:03.030
"So we should expect a
different number.",00:11:03.030,00:11:04.880
"And it's not going to be
pi / 4, it's going to",00:11:04.880,00:11:06.950
be something else.,00:11:06.950,00:11:07.850
"Whatever it is, it should
be smaller than pi / 4.",00:11:07.850,00:11:12.170
"Now, let's set up
the integral.",00:11:12.170,00:11:14.200
"The integral follows
the same rule.",00:11:14.200,00:11:17.100
"It's just 1 over the length
of the interval times the",00:11:17.100,00:11:19.870
"integral over the interval
of the function.",00:11:19.870,00:11:24.390
"That's the integral, but now
where does theta range?",00:11:24.390,00:11:27.480
"This time, theta goes
from 0 to pi.",00:11:27.480,00:11:32.430
"So the integral is
from 0 to pi.",00:11:32.430,00:11:34.990
"And the thing we divide
by is pi.",00:11:34.990,00:11:40.140
"And the integration requires
us to know the",00:11:40.140,00:11:42.710
formula for the height.,00:11:42.710,00:11:44.160
Which is sin theta.,00:11:44.160,00:11:47.410
"In terms of theta, of course.",00:11:47.410,00:11:48.680
"It's the same as square root of
- x^2, but it's expressed",00:11:48.680,00:11:51.710
in terms of theta.,00:11:51.710,00:11:53.360
So it's this.,00:11:53.360,00:11:55.200
And here's our average.,00:11:55.200,00:11:58.340
I'll put this up here.,00:11:58.340,00:12:01.210
"So that's the formula
for the height.",00:12:01.210,00:12:09.010
So let's work it out.,00:12:09.010,00:12:10.810
"This one, we have the advantage
of being able to",00:12:10.810,00:12:13.050
"work out because we know the
antiderivative of sin theta.",00:12:13.050,00:12:16.920
"It happens with this factor
of pi, it's - cos theta.",00:12:16.920,00:12:25.530
"And so, that's - 1 / pi ( cos
pi), sorry. (cos pi - cos) 0.",00:12:25.530,00:12:35.730
"Which is - 1 / pi ( -
2), which is 2 / pi.",00:12:35.730,00:12:47.340
"And sure enough, if you check
it, you'll see that 2 / pi &lt;",00:12:47.340,00:12:54.840
"pi / 4, because pi^2 &gt; 8.",00:12:54.840,00:13:02.250
"Yeah, question.",00:13:02.250,00:13:02.980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:13:02.980,00:13:06.610
"PROFESSOR: The question is
how do I get sin theta.",00:13:06.610,00:13:09.700
"And the answer is, on this
diagram, if theta is over here",00:13:09.700,00:13:16.080
"then this height is this, and
this is the angle theta, then",00:13:16.080,00:13:20.090
the height is the sine.,00:13:20.090,00:13:22.790
OK.,00:13:22.790,00:13:26.600
Another question.,00:13:26.600,00:13:27.320
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:13:27.320,00:13:32.160
"PROFESSOR: The question is,
what is the first one, the",00:13:32.160,00:13:41.350
"first one is an average of
height, of a point on a",00:13:41.350,00:13:44.490
"semicircle and this one
is with respect to x.",00:13:44.490,00:13:51.310
"So what this reveals is that
it's ambiguous to say what the",00:13:51.310,00:13:54.290
"average value of something is,
unless you've explained what",00:13:54.290,00:13:57.280
"the underlying averaging
variable is.",00:13:57.280,00:14:00.200
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:14:00.200,00:14:08.140
"PROFESSOR: The next question
is how should you interpret",00:14:08.140,00:14:11.950
this value.,00:14:11.950,00:14:13.860
"That is, what came out
of this calculation?",00:14:13.860,00:14:17.250
"And the answer is only
sort of embedded in",00:14:17.250,00:14:22.560
this calculation itself.,00:14:22.560,00:14:26.050
"So here's a way of thinking of
it which is anticipating our",00:14:26.050,00:14:28.980
next subject.,00:14:28.980,00:14:29.730
Which is probability.,00:14:29.730,00:14:31.520
"Which is, suppose you
picked a number at",00:14:31.520,00:14:34.950
random in this interval.,00:14:34.950,00:14:36.660
"With equal likelihood, one
place and another.",00:14:36.660,00:14:39.440
"And then you saw what height
was above that.",00:14:39.440,00:14:42.080
"That would be the interpretation
of this first",00:14:42.080,00:14:43.970
average value.,00:14:43.970,00:14:45.290
"And the second one is, I picked
something at random on",00:14:45.290,00:14:47.950
this circle.,00:14:47.950,00:14:50.110
"And equally likely, any possible
point on this circle",00:14:50.110,00:14:53.240
according to its length.,00:14:53.240,00:14:54.970
"And then I ask what the height
of that point is.",00:14:54.970,00:14:58.180
"And those are just
different things.",00:14:58.180,00:15:04.670
Another question.,00:15:04.670,00:15:05.460
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:15:05.460,00:15:09.510
"PROFESSOR: Cos pi, shouldn't
it be 0?",00:15:09.510,00:15:12.340
"No. cos of, it's - 1.",00:15:12.340,00:15:16.830
Cos pi = - 1.,00:15:16.830,00:15:19.440
"Cosine, sorry.",00:15:19.440,00:15:25.110
"No, cos 0 = 1. cos pi = - 1.",00:15:25.110,00:15:29.240
And so they cancel.,00:15:29.240,00:15:30.540
"That is, they don't cancel.",00:15:30.540,00:15:31.600
"It's - 1 - 1, which = - 2.",00:15:31.600,00:15:35.880
Key point.,00:15:35.880,00:15:38.120
Yeah.,00:15:38.120,00:15:38.330
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:15:38.330,00:15:49.680
"PROFESSOR: All right,
let me repeat.",00:15:49.680,00:15:51.260
"So the question was to repeat
the reasoning by which I",00:15:51.260,00:15:57.620
"guessed in advance that probably
this was going to be",00:15:57.620,00:16:01.170
"the relationship between the
average value with respect to",00:16:01.170,00:16:04.910
"arc length versus the average
value with respect to this",00:16:04.910,00:16:07.130
horizontal distance.,00:16:07.130,00:16:10.790
"And it had to do with
the previous way",00:16:10.790,00:16:13.110
this diagram was drawn.,00:16:13.110,00:16:16.980
"Which is comparing an
interval in dx with",00:16:16.980,00:16:21.920
an interval in theta.,00:16:21.920,00:16:25.800
A little section in theta.,00:16:25.800,00:16:27.780
"And when you're near the top,
they're nearly this same.",00:16:27.780,00:16:32.530
"That is, it's more
or less balanced.",00:16:32.530,00:16:34.430
"It's a little curved here,
a little different.",00:16:34.430,00:16:36.340
"But here it becomes
very exaggerated.",00:16:36.340,00:16:39.010
"The d theta lengths are much
longer than the dx lengths.",00:16:39.010,00:16:42.390
"Which means that importance
given by the theta of variable",00:16:42.390,00:16:47.450
"to these parts of the
circle is larger,",00:16:47.450,00:16:51.130
relative to these parts.,00:16:51.130,00:16:52.930
"Whereas if you look at this
section versus this section",00:16:52.930,00:16:55.830
"for the dx, they give
equal weights to",00:16:55.830,00:16:57.720
these two equal lengths.,00:16:57.720,00:16:59.090
"But here, with respect to theta,
this is relatively",00:16:59.090,00:17:01.320
short and this is much larger.,00:17:01.320,00:17:03.090
"So, as I say, the theta
variable's emphasizing the",00:17:03.090,00:17:05.960
"lower parts of the
semicircle more.",00:17:05.960,00:17:09.140
"That's because this length
is shorter and",00:17:09.140,00:17:11.070
this length is longer.,00:17:11.070,00:17:12.340
"Whereas these two
are the same.",00:17:12.340,00:17:16.130
"It's a balancing act of
the relative weights.",00:17:16.130,00:17:20.110
"I'm going to say that again
in a different way,",00:17:20.110,00:17:22.290
and maybe this will.,00:17:22.290,00:17:25.320
"The lower part is more
important for theta.",00:17:25.320,00:17:31.810
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:17:31.810,00:17:32.190
"PROFESSOR: So the question is,
but shouldn't it have a bigger",00:17:32.190,00:17:33.930
"value because it's
a longer length.",00:17:33.930,00:17:35.920
Never with averages.,00:17:35.920,00:17:37.620
"Whatever the length is,
we're always dividing.",00:17:37.620,00:17:39.540
"We're always compensating
by the total.",00:17:39.540,00:17:42.760
"We have the integral from 0 to
pi, but we're dividing by pi.",00:17:42.760,00:17:45.410
"Here we had the integral
from - 1 to 1, but",00:17:45.410,00:17:48.060
we're dividing by 2.,00:17:48.060,00:17:49.760
"So we divide by something
different each time.",00:17:49.760,00:17:52.220
"And this is very,
very important.",00:17:52.220,00:17:53.850
"It's that the average of a
constant is that same constant",00:17:53.850,00:17:56.550
"regardless of which
one we did.",00:17:56.550,00:17:58.070
"So if it were a constant, we
would always compensate for",00:17:58.070,00:18:00.930
the length.,00:18:00.930,00:18:01.270
So the length never matters.,00:18:01.270,00:18:03.780
"If it's the integral from 0 to
1,000,000, or 100, let's say,",00:18:03.780,00:18:09.160
"1/100 cdx, it's just the same.",00:18:09.160,00:18:12.330
"It's always that, it doesn't
matter how long it is.",00:18:12.330,00:18:14.160
Because we compensate.,00:18:14.160,00:18:18.050
"That's really the difference
between an integral and an",00:18:18.050,00:18:19.730
"average, is that we're dividing
by the total.",00:18:19.730,00:18:24.750
"Now I want to introduce another
notion, which is",00:18:24.750,00:18:27.560
"actually what's underlying these
two examples that I just",00:18:27.560,00:18:31.500
wrote down.,00:18:31.500,00:18:32.060
"And this is by far the one which
you should emphasize the",00:18:32.060,00:18:36.050
most in your thoughts.,00:18:36.050,00:18:39.470
"Because it is much more
flexible, and is much more",00:18:39.470,00:18:45.590
"typical of real life problems.
So the idea of a weighted",00:18:45.590,00:18:50.770
average is the following.,00:18:50.770,00:18:53.920
"You take the integral, say from
a to b, of some function.",00:18:53.920,00:18:57.580
"But now you multiply
by a weight.",00:18:57.580,00:19:02.550
"And you have to divide
by the total.",00:19:02.550,00:19:05.560
"And what's the total
going to be?",00:19:05.560,00:19:07.410
"It's the integral from a to b
of this total weighting that",00:19:07.410,00:19:11.820
"we have. Now, why is this
the correct notion?",00:19:11.820,00:19:17.190
"I'm going to explain it
to you in two ways.",00:19:17.190,00:19:20.420
"The first is this very
simpleminded thing that I",00:19:20.420,00:19:24.990
"wrote on the board there,
with the constants.",00:19:24.990,00:19:30.480
"What we want is the average
value of c to be c.",00:19:30.480,00:19:38.480
"Otherwise this makes no
sense as an average.",00:19:38.480,00:19:40.820
"Now, let's just look at
this definition here.",00:19:40.820,00:19:43.070
And see that that's correct.,00:19:43.070,00:19:44.660
"If you integrate c, from a to
b, w ( x) dx, and you divide",00:19:44.660,00:19:50.900
"by the integral from a to b, w (
x) dx, not surprisingly, the",00:19:50.900,00:19:56.030
c factors out.,00:19:56.030,00:19:57.020
It's a constant.,00:19:57.020,00:19:59.010
"So this is c times the integral
a to b, w (x), dx,",00:19:59.010,00:20:03.430
divided by the same thing.,00:20:03.430,00:20:05.380
And that's why we picked it.,00:20:05.380,00:20:08.390
"We picked it so that these
things would cancel.",00:20:08.390,00:20:10.170
And this would give c.,00:20:10.170,00:20:14.660
"So in the previous case, this
property explains the",00:20:14.660,00:20:17.910
denominator.,00:20:17.910,00:20:20.140
"And again over here, it explains
the denominator.",00:20:20.140,00:20:29.760
"And let me just give you
one more explanation.",00:20:29.760,00:20:32.510
"Which is maybe a real life
pretend real life example.",00:20:32.510,00:20:38.340
"You have a stock which you
bought for $10 one year.",00:20:38.340,00:20:43.060
"And then six months later you
brought some more for $20.",00:20:43.060,00:20:46.740
"And then you bought
some more for $30.",00:20:46.740,00:20:50.360
"Now, what's the average
price of your stock?",00:20:50.360,00:20:53.810
"Well, it depends on how many
shares you bought.",00:20:53.810,00:20:58.370
"If you bought this many shares
the first time, and this many",00:20:58.370,00:21:01.290
"shares the second time, and
this many shares the third",00:21:01.290,00:21:03.760
"time, this is the total
amount that you spent.",00:21:03.760,00:21:07.230
"And the average price is the
total price divided by the",00:21:07.230,00:21:14.090
total number of shares.,00:21:14.090,00:21:17.120
"And this is the discrete analog
of this continuous",00:21:17.120,00:21:22.560
averaging process here.,00:21:22.560,00:21:24.070
"The function f now, so I use w
for weight, the function f now",00:21:24.070,00:21:28.260
"is the function whose values
are 10, 20 and 30.",00:21:28.260,00:21:31.150
"And the weightings are the
relative importance of the",00:21:31.150,00:21:35.800
different purchases.,00:21:35.800,00:21:42.030
"So again, these wi's
are weights.",00:21:42.030,00:21:51.600
There was another question.,00:21:51.600,00:21:52.710
"Out in the audience,
at some point.",00:21:52.710,00:21:54.400
"Over here, yes.",00:21:54.400,00:21:55.300
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:21:55.300,00:22:04.520
"PROFESSOR: Very, very
good point.",00:22:04.520,00:22:06.920
"So in this numerator here, the
statement is, in this example,",00:22:06.920,00:22:15.710
we factored out c.,00:22:15.710,00:22:17.020
"But here we cannot factor
out f ( x).",00:22:17.020,00:22:20.710
"That's extremely important and
that is the whole point.",00:22:20.710,00:22:23.450
"So, in other words, the weighted
average is very",00:22:23.450,00:22:25.950
"interesting you have to do two
different integrals to figure",00:22:25.950,00:22:29.820
it out in general.,00:22:29.820,00:22:32.380
"When it happens that
this is c, it's an",00:22:32.380,00:22:34.120
extremely boring integral.,00:22:34.120,00:22:35.430
"Which in fact because, it's an
average, you don't even have",00:22:35.430,00:22:37.620
to calculate at all.,00:22:37.620,00:22:38.930
"Factor it out and cancel these
things and never bother to",00:22:38.930,00:22:41.490
calculate these two numbers.,00:22:41.490,00:22:43.530
"So these massive numbers
just cancel.",00:22:43.530,00:22:46.580
"So it's a very special property
of a constant, that",00:22:46.580,00:22:48.975
it factors out.,00:22:48.975,00:22:55.650
"That was our first discussion,
and now with this example I'm",00:22:55.650,00:23:00.100
"going to go back to the heating
up of the witches'",00:23:00.100,00:23:02.900
"cauldron and we'll use average
value to illustrate the",00:23:02.900,00:23:07.600
"integral that we get in
that context as well.",00:23:07.600,00:23:19.700
"I remind you, let's see.",00:23:19.700,00:23:20.910
"The situation with the witches'
cauldron was this.",00:23:20.910,00:23:25.480
"The first important thing is
that there were, so this is",00:23:25.480,00:23:40.260
the big cauldron here.,00:23:40.260,00:23:42.770
"This is the one whose height
is 1 meter and",00:23:42.770,00:23:47.210
whose width is 2 meters.,00:23:47.210,00:23:53.190
"And it's a parabola of
revolution here.",00:23:53.190,00:23:56.540
"And it had about approximately
1600 liters in it.",00:23:56.540,00:24:06.500
And this curve was y = x^2.,00:24:06.500,00:24:14.640
"And the situation that I
described at the end of last",00:24:14.640,00:24:18.560
"time was that the initial
temperature was",00:24:18.560,00:24:25.210
T = 0 degrees Celsius.,00:24:25.210,00:24:28.560
"And the final temperature,
instead of being a constant",00:24:28.560,00:24:35.320
"temperature, we were heating
this guy up from the bottom.",00:24:35.320,00:24:41.290
"And it was hotter on the
bottom than on the top.",00:24:41.290,00:24:48.340
"And the final temperature was
given by the formula T = 100 -",00:24:48.340,00:24:54.870
30 times the height y.,00:24:54.870,00:24:57.880
"So at y = 0, at the
bottom, it's 100.",00:24:57.880,00:25:04.090
"And at the top, T
= 70 degrees.",00:25:04.090,00:25:10.730
"OK, so this is the final
configuration for the",00:25:10.730,00:25:15.420
temperature.,00:25:15.420,00:25:16.020
"And the question was how
much energy do we need.",00:25:16.020,00:25:33.100
"So, the first observation here,
and this is the reason",00:25:33.100,00:25:36.670
"for giving this example, is that
it's important to realize",00:25:36.670,00:25:42.630
"that you want to use the method
of disks in this case.",00:25:42.630,00:25:54.700
"The reason, so it doesn't have
to do with, you shouldn't",00:25:54.700,00:25:58.040
"think of the disks first. But
what you should think of is",00:25:58.040,00:26:02.060
the horizontal.,00:26:02.060,00:26:05.010
"We must use horizontals because
T is constant on",00:26:05.010,00:26:09.780
horizontals.,00:26:09.780,00:26:10.840
"It's not constant
on verticals.",00:26:10.840,00:26:12.740
"If we set things up with shells,
as we did last time,",00:26:12.740,00:26:16.130
"to compute the volume
of this, then T will",00:26:16.130,00:26:18.980
vary along the shell.,00:26:18.980,00:26:21.760
"And we will still have an
averaging problem, an integral",00:26:21.760,00:26:24.620
"problem along the vertical
portion.",00:26:24.620,00:26:26.730
"But if we do it this way,
T is constant on",00:26:26.730,00:26:29.460
this whole level here.,00:26:29.460,00:26:31.770
"And so there's no more
calculus involved in",00:26:31.770,00:26:34.400
"calculating what the
contribution is",00:26:34.400,00:26:36.140
of any given level.,00:26:36.140,00:26:39.840
"So t is constant
on horizontals.",00:26:39.840,00:26:49.620
"Actually, in disguise, this
is that same trick",00:26:49.620,00:26:52.750
that we have here.,00:26:52.750,00:26:53.370
"We can factor constants
out of integrals.",00:26:53.370,00:26:55.680
"You could view it as an
integral, but the point is",00:26:55.680,00:26:57.580
"that it's more elementary
than that.",00:26:57.580,00:27:03.480
"Now I have to set
it up for you.",00:27:03.480,00:27:06.430
"And in order to do that, I
need to remember what the",00:27:06.430,00:27:09.230
equation is.,00:27:09.230,00:27:10.470
Which is y = x ^2.,00:27:10.470,00:27:12.960
"And the formula for the total
amount of energy is going to",00:27:12.960,00:27:19.030
"be volume times the
number of degrees.",00:27:19.030,00:27:25.000
"That's going to be equal to the
energy that we need here.",00:27:25.000,00:27:31.480
And so let's add it up.,00:27:31.480,00:27:33.250
"It's the integral from 0 to 1,
and this is with respect to y.",00:27:33.250,00:27:38.540
"So the y level goes
from 0 to 1.",00:27:38.540,00:27:41.300
"This top level's y = 1, this
bottom level's y = 0.",00:27:41.300,00:27:47.310
"And the disk that we get, this
is the point (x, y) here, is",00:27:47.310,00:27:55.260
rotated around.,00:27:55.260,00:27:56.220
And its radius is x.,00:27:56.220,00:28:01.230
"So the thickness is dy,
and the area of",00:28:01.230,00:28:05.500
the disk is pi x^2.,00:28:05.500,00:28:09.480
"And the thing that we're
averaging is T. Well, we're",00:28:09.480,00:28:13.830
"not yet averaging, we're
just integrating it.",00:28:13.830,00:28:16.010
"We're just adding
up the total.",00:28:16.010,00:28:24.170
"Now I'm just going to plug in
the various values for this.",00:28:24.170,00:28:29.080
"And what I'm going to get is
T, again, = 100 - 30y.",00:28:29.080,00:28:36.580
"And this radius is measured
up to this very end.",00:28:36.580,00:28:40.960
So x^2 = y.,00:28:40.960,00:28:42.440
So this is pi y dy.,00:28:42.440,00:28:45.410
"And this is the integral that
we'll be able to evaluate.",00:28:45.410,00:28:47.800
"Yeah, question.",00:28:47.800,00:28:48.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:28:48.660,00:28:50.250
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:28:50.250,00:29:00.070
"Well, let's carry this out.",00:29:00.070,00:29:05.710
"Let's finish off the
calculation here.",00:29:05.710,00:29:09.160
Let's see.,00:29:09.160,00:29:10.230
"This is equal to, what
does it equal to.",00:29:10.230,00:29:16.380
"Well, I'll put it over here.",00:29:16.380,00:29:19.580
"It's equal to 50 pi y ^2 -
right, because this is 100 pi",00:29:19.580,00:29:27.780
"y, and then there's a 30, this
is 100 pi y - 30 pi y ^2, and",00:29:27.780,00:29:36.950
"I have to take the
antiderivative of that.",00:29:36.950,00:29:38.780
"So I get 50 pi y ^2, and
I get 10 pi y ^3.",00:29:38.780,00:29:45.450
Evaluate it at 0 and 1.,00:29:45.450,00:29:48.120
And that is 40 pi.,00:29:48.120,00:29:57.930
"Now, I spent a tremendous
amount of time last time",00:29:57.930,00:30:05.140
focusing on units.,00:30:05.140,00:30:07.900
"Because I want to tell you
how to get a realistic",00:30:07.900,00:30:10.710
number out of this.,00:30:10.710,00:30:12.080
"And there's a subtle point here
that I pointed out last",00:30:12.080,00:30:16.515
"time that had to do with
changing meters to",00:30:16.515,00:30:18.650
centimeters.,00:30:18.650,00:30:19.160
"I claim that I've treated
those correctly.",00:30:19.160,00:30:22.570
"So, what we have here is that
the answer is in degrees, that",00:30:22.570,00:30:28.100
"is Celsius, times
cubic meters.",00:30:28.100,00:30:34.800
These are the correct units.,00:30:34.800,00:30:36.570
"And now, I can translate this
into Celsius is spelled with a",00:30:36.570,00:30:43.760
C. That's interesting.,00:30:43.760,00:30:44.896
Celsius.,00:30:44.896,00:30:46.630
"I can translate this into
units that you're more",00:30:46.630,00:30:49.840
familiar with.,00:30:49.840,00:30:50.850
"So let's try 40 pi deg
* m ^3, and then do",00:30:50.850,00:30:58.240
the conversion factors.,00:30:58.240,00:30:59.710
"First of all there's one calorie
per degree times a",00:30:59.710,00:31:07.310
milliliter.,00:31:07.310,00:31:08.840
That's one conversion.,00:31:08.840,00:31:11.150
And then let's see.,00:31:11.150,00:31:14.600
"I'm going to have to translate
from centimeters so I have",00:31:14.600,00:31:17.150
here (100 cm / m)^ 3.,00:31:17.150,00:31:25.110
So these are the two conversion,00:31:25.110,00:31:26.290
factors that I need.,00:31:26.290,00:31:30.550
"And so, I get 40 pi ( 10
^ 6), that's 100^3.",00:31:30.550,00:31:38.690
And this is in calories.,00:31:38.690,00:31:46.550
So how much is this?,00:31:46.550,00:31:48.470
"Well, it's a little better,
maybe, to do it in 40 pi *",00:31:48.470,00:31:53.910
"1,000 kilocalories, because
these are the ones that you",00:31:53.910,00:31:59.210
"actually see on your nutrition
labels of foods.",00:31:59.210,00:32:05.710
"And so this number is
around 125 or so.",00:32:05.710,00:32:12.600
"Let's see, is that
about right?",00:32:12.600,00:32:15.960
"Let's make sure I've got
these numbers right.",00:32:15.960,00:32:17.930
"Yeah, this is about 125.",00:32:17.930,00:32:20.550
40 pi.,00:32:20.550,00:32:22.780
"And so one candy bar, this is
a Halloween example, so.",00:32:22.780,00:32:32.220
"One candy bar is about
250 kilocalories.",00:32:32.220,00:32:38.460
So this is half a candy bar.,00:32:38.460,00:32:44.620
"So the answer to our question
is that it takes 500 candy",00:32:44.620,00:32:53.130
bars to heat up this thing.,00:32:53.130,00:33:02.900
"OK, so that's our example.",00:33:02.900,00:33:07.570
"Now, yeah.",00:33:07.570,00:33:08.630
Question.,00:33:08.630,00:33:09.160
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:33:09.160,00:33:13.710
"PROFESSOR: What does the
integral give us?",00:33:13.710,00:33:16.980
"This integral is, the
integral represents",00:33:16.980,00:33:22.500
the following things.,00:33:22.500,00:33:23.470
"So the question is, what does
this integral give us.",00:33:23.470,00:33:26.330
So here's the integral.,00:33:26.330,00:33:27.640
"Here it is, rewritten so that
it can be calculated.",00:33:27.640,00:33:30.640
"And what this integral
is giving us is",00:33:30.640,00:33:33.370
the following thing.,00:33:33.370,00:33:34.170
"You have to imagine the
following idea.",00:33:34.170,00:33:36.160
"You've got a little chunk
of water in here.",00:33:36.160,00:33:39.220
"And you're going to raise is
from 0 degrees all the way up",00:33:39.220,00:33:42.320
"to whatever the target
temperature is.",00:33:42.320,00:33:46.840
"And so that little milliliter of
water, if you like, has to",00:33:46.840,00:33:51.190
"be raised from 0 to some number
which is a function of",00:33:51.190,00:33:54.900
the height.,00:33:54.900,00:33:56.730
"It's something between
70 and 100 degrees.",00:33:56.730,00:33:59.950
"And the one right above it also
has to be raised to a",00:33:59.950,00:34:04.190
"temperature, although
a slightly different",00:34:04.190,00:34:05.530
temperature.,00:34:05.530,00:34:06.280
"And what we're doing with the
integral is we're adding up",00:34:06.280,00:34:08.840
"all of those degrees and the
calorie represents how much it",00:34:08.840,00:34:15.700
"takes, one calorie represents
how much it takes to raise by",00:34:15.700,00:34:18.220
"1 degree 1 milliliter
of water.",00:34:18.220,00:34:21.980
One cubic centimeter of water.,00:34:21.980,00:34:26.620
"That's the definition
of a calorie.",00:34:26.620,00:34:31.610
And we're adding it up.,00:34:31.610,00:34:32.990
"So in other words, each of
these cubes is one thing.",00:34:32.990,00:34:35.430
"And now we have to add it up
over this massive thing, which",00:34:35.430,00:34:38.010
is 1600 liters.,00:34:38.010,00:34:40.150
"And we have a lot of different
little cubes.",00:34:40.150,00:34:42.140
And that's what we did.,00:34:42.140,00:34:43.420
"When we glommed them
all together.",00:34:43.420,00:34:45.320
"That's what the integral
is doing for us.",00:34:45.320,00:34:48.800
Other questions.,00:34:48.800,00:34:54.200
"Now I want to connect this
with weighted averages",00:34:54.200,00:34:57.400
before we go on.,00:34:57.400,00:34:58.800
"Because that was the reason why
I did weighted averages",00:34:58.800,00:35:01.810
"first. I'm going to compute
also the average final",00:35:01.810,00:35:06.330
temperature.,00:35:06.330,00:35:14.810
"So, final because this is the
interesting one, the average",00:35:14.810,00:35:18.120
"starting temperature's
very boring, it's 0.",00:35:18.120,00:35:21.030
"The average final temperature
is, individually the",00:35:21.030,00:35:26.180
temperatures are different.,00:35:26.180,00:35:27.840
"And the answer here is it's the
integral from 0 to 1 of T",00:35:27.840,00:35:33.110
"pi y dy divided by the
integral from 0",00:35:33.110,00:35:38.390
to 1 of pi y dy.,00:35:38.390,00:35:42.040
"So this is the total
temperature, weighted",00:35:42.040,00:35:44.540
"appropriately to the volume of
water that's involved at that",00:35:44.540,00:35:48.070
"temperature, divided by the
total volume of water.",00:35:48.070,00:35:52.880
"And we computed these
two numbers.",00:35:52.880,00:35:55.130
"The number in the numerator
is what we call 40 pi.",00:35:55.130,00:35:58.350
"And the number in the
denominator, actually this is",00:35:58.350,00:36:00.570
"easier than what we did last
time with shells you can just",00:36:00.570,00:36:03.340
"look at this and see that it's
the area under a triangle.",00:36:03.340,00:36:06.160
It's pi / 2.,00:36:06.160,00:36:08.500
"And so the answer here
is 80 degrees.",00:36:08.500,00:36:11.760
"This is the average
temperature.",00:36:11.760,00:36:14.910
"Note that this is a
weighted average.",00:36:14.910,00:36:17.670
The weighting here is different,00:36:17.670,00:36:21.640
according to the height.,00:36:21.640,00:36:22.810
The weighting factor is pi y.,00:36:22.810,00:36:28.190
That's the weighting factor.,00:36:28.190,00:36:30.010
And that's not surprising.,00:36:30.010,00:36:32.270
"When y is small, there's
less volume down here.",00:36:32.270,00:36:35.630
"Up above, those are more
important volumes, because",00:36:35.630,00:36:38.940
"there's more water up at the top
of the cauldron than there",00:36:38.940,00:36:42.040
"is down at the bottom
of the cauldron.",00:36:42.040,00:36:43.960
"If you compare this to the
ordinary average, if you take",00:36:43.960,00:36:46.895
"the maximum temperature plus
the minimum temperature,",00:36:46.895,00:36:51.230
"divided by 2, that would
be 100 + 70 / 2.",00:36:51.230,00:36:56.470
You would get 85 degrees.,00:36:56.470,00:36:59.830
And that's bigger.,00:36:59.830,00:37:01.610
Why?,00:37:01.610,00:37:02.440
"Because the cooler
water is on top.",00:37:02.440,00:37:05.030
"And the actual average, the
correct weighted average, is",00:37:05.030,00:37:08.770
lower than this fake average.,00:37:08.770,00:37:11.800
"Which is not the true average
in this context.",00:37:11.800,00:37:15.520
"All right so the weighting is
that the thing is getting",00:37:15.520,00:37:18.090
fatter near the top.,00:37:18.090,00:37:33.160
"So now I'm going to do another
example of weighted average.",00:37:33.160,00:37:38.980
"And this example is also very
much worth your while.",00:37:38.980,00:37:46.020
"It's the other incredibly
important one in",00:37:46.020,00:37:49.210
interpreting integrals.,00:37:49.210,00:37:51.960
"And it's a very, very simple
example of a function, f.",00:37:51.960,00:37:56.790
"The weightings will be
different, but the functions,",00:37:56.790,00:38:00.150
"f, will be of a very
particular kind.",00:38:00.150,00:38:03.320
"Namely, the function f will
be practically a constant.",00:38:03.320,00:38:07.450
But not quite.,00:38:07.450,00:38:08.480
"It's going to be a constant on
one interval, and then 0 on",00:38:08.480,00:38:11.340
"the rest. So we'll do those
weighted averages now.",00:38:11.340,00:38:16.950
"And this subject is called
probability.",00:38:16.950,00:38:34.900
"In probability, what we do, so
I'm just going to give some",00:38:34.900,00:38:40.420
examples here.,00:38:40.420,00:38:43.910
"I'm going to pick a point to in
quotation marks at random.",00:38:43.910,00:38:54.620
"In the region y &lt;
x &lt; 1 - x ^2.",00:38:54.620,00:39:00.900
That's this shape here.,00:39:00.900,00:39:05.060
"Well, let's draw it
right down here.",00:39:05.060,00:39:08.770
For now.,00:39:08.770,00:39:09.310
"So, somewhere in here.",00:39:09.310,00:39:10.380
"Some point, (x, y).",00:39:10.380,00:39:13.310
"And then I need to tell you,
according to what this random",00:39:13.310,00:39:19.440
really means.,00:39:19.440,00:39:20.330
"This is proportional to
area, if you like.",00:39:20.330,00:39:31.780
"So area inside of
this section.",00:39:31.780,00:39:33.990
"And then the question that we're
going to answer right",00:39:33.990,00:39:36.260
"now is, what is the chance
that, it's usually called",00:39:36.260,00:39:46.620
"probability, that x &gt; 1/2.",00:39:46.620,00:39:56.980
"Let me show you what's
going on here.",00:39:56.980,00:40:03.620
"And this is always the case with
things in probability.",00:40:03.620,00:40:08.780
"So, first of all, we have
a name for this.",00:40:08.780,00:40:10.290
This is called P ( x &gt; 1/2).,00:40:10.290,00:40:16.220
"And so that's what it's called
in our notation here.",00:40:16.220,00:40:21.060
"And what it is, is the
probability is always equal to",00:40:21.060,00:40:27.900
the part / the whole.,00:40:27.900,00:40:32.760
"It's a ratio just like
the one over there.",00:40:32.760,00:40:36.930
"And which is the part and
which is the whole.",00:40:36.930,00:40:38.720
"Well, in this picture, the whole
is the whole parabola.",00:40:38.720,00:40:43.470
"And the part is the
section x &gt; 1/2.",00:40:43.470,00:40:48.910
"And it's just the ratio
of those two areas.",00:40:48.910,00:41:00.460
Let's write that down.,00:41:00.460,00:41:01.970
"That's the integral from 1/2 to
1 of (1 - x ^2) dx, divided",00:41:01.970,00:41:09.210
"by the integral from - 1
to 1, (1 - x ^2 ) dx.",00:41:09.210,00:41:16.000
"And again, the weighting
factor here is 1 - x^2.",00:41:16.000,00:41:23.350
"And to be a little bit more
specific here, the starting",00:41:23.350,00:41:27.570
"point a = - 1 and the
endpoint b = + 1.",00:41:27.570,00:41:33.390
So this is P(x &lt; 1/2).,00:41:33.390,00:41:37.540
"And if you work it out,
it turns out to be",00:41:37.540,00:41:42.070
"5/18, we won't do it.",00:41:42.070,00:41:47.210
Yeah.,00:41:47.210,00:41:47.470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:41:47.470,00:42:21.130
"PROFESSOR: What we're trying
to do with probability.",00:42:21.130,00:42:23.170
"So I can't repeat
your question.",00:42:23.170,00:42:26.760
"But I can try say, because
it was a little bit too",00:42:26.760,00:42:30.720
complicated.,00:42:30.720,00:42:31.580
"But it was not correct, OK.",00:42:31.580,00:42:35.020
"What we're taking is,
we have two possible",00:42:35.020,00:42:38.490
things that could happen.,00:42:38.490,00:42:39.940
"Either, let's put it this way.",00:42:39.940,00:42:42.640
Let's make it a gamble.,00:42:42.640,00:42:43.910
"Somebody picks a point
in here at random.",00:42:43.910,00:42:47.150
"And we're trying to figure
out what your",00:42:47.150,00:42:53.160
chances are of winning.,00:42:53.160,00:42:54.750
"In other words, the chances the
person picks something in",00:42:54.750,00:42:56.830
"here versus something
in there.",00:42:56.830,00:42:59.670
"And the interesting thing
is, so what percent of",00:42:59.670,00:43:01.570
the time do you win.,00:43:01.570,00:43:04.220
"The answer is it's some
fraction of 1.",00:43:04.220,00:43:06.600
"And in order to figure that out,
I have to figure out the",00:43:06.600,00:43:08.880
total area here.,00:43:08.880,00:43:11.900
"Versus the total of the entire,
all the way from - 1",00:43:11.900,00:43:15.210
"to 1, the beginning
to the end.",00:43:15.210,00:43:18.190
"So in the numerator, I put
success, and in the",00:43:18.190,00:43:22.580
"denominator I put all
possibilities.",00:43:22.580,00:43:25.250
"So that, right?",00:43:25.250,00:43:26.720
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:43:26.720,00:43:29.260
"PROFESSOR: And that's the
interpretation of this.",00:43:29.260,00:43:31.080
"So maybe I didn't understand
your question.",00:43:31.080,00:43:33.060
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:43:33.060,00:43:37.900
"PROFESSOR: Ah, why is 1 - x
^2 the weighting factor.",00:43:37.900,00:43:40.130
"That has to do with how you
compute areas under curves.",00:43:40.130,00:43:44.550
"The curve here is
y = 1 - x ^2.",00:43:44.550,00:43:49.040
"And so, in order to calculate
how much area is between 1/2",00:43:49.040,00:43:51.810
"and 1, I have to integrate.",00:43:51.810,00:43:52.940
"That's the interpretation
of this.",00:43:52.940,00:43:54.440
"This is the area under
that curve.",00:43:54.440,00:43:56.450
This integral.,00:43:56.450,00:43:57.220
"And the denominator's the area
under the whole thing.",00:43:57.220,00:44:01.200
"OK, yeah.",00:44:01.200,00:44:02.180
Another question.,00:44:02.180,00:44:02.760

PROFESSOR: Ah.,00:44:06.060,00:44:08.100
Yikes.,00:44:08.100,00:44:09.460
"It was supposed to be the same
question as over here.",00:44:09.460,00:44:12.690
Thank you.,00:44:12.690,00:44:13.030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:44:13.030,00:44:18.710
"PROFESSOR: This has something to
do with weighting factors.",00:44:18.710,00:44:21.420
Here's the weight factor.,00:44:21.420,00:44:25.410
"Well, it's the relative
importance from the point of",00:44:25.410,00:44:28.260
"view of this probability of
these places versus those.",00:44:28.260,00:44:33.160
"That is, so this is a weighting
factor because it's",00:44:33.160,00:44:36.080
"telling me that in some sense
this number 5/18, actually",00:44:36.080,00:44:45.070
"that makes me think that this
number is probably wrong.",00:44:45.070,00:44:48.420
"Well, I'll let you
calculate it out.",00:44:48.420,00:44:53.170
"It looks like it should be less
than 1/4 here, because",00:44:53.170,00:44:56.290
"this is 1/4 of the total
distance and there's a little",00:44:56.290,00:44:58.290
"less in here than there
is in the middle.",00:44:58.290,00:45:00.860
"So in fact it probably should be
less than 1/4, the answer.",00:45:00.860,00:45:03.270
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:45:03.270,00:45:09.190
"PROFESSOR: The equation of
the curve is 1 - x^2.",00:45:09.190,00:45:11.070
"The reason why it's the
weighting factor is that we're",00:45:13.670,00:45:15.740
"interpreting, the question
has to do with the",00:45:15.740,00:45:18.140
area under that curve.,00:45:18.140,00:45:20.120
"And so, this is showing us how
much is relatively important",00:45:20.120,00:45:24.020
versus how much is not.,00:45:24.020,00:45:25.200
"This is, these parts are
relatively important, these",00:45:25.200,00:45:27.790
parts are less important.,00:45:27.790,00:45:28.660
According to area.,00:45:28.660,00:45:29.960
"Because we've said that
area is the way",00:45:29.960,00:45:31.730
we're making the choice.,00:45:31.730,00:45:35.920
"So I don't have quite enough
time to tell you",00:45:35.920,00:45:40.400
about my next example.,00:45:40.400,00:45:43.530
"Instead, I'm just going to
tell you what the general",00:45:43.530,00:45:45.870
formula is.,00:45:45.870,00:45:46.820
"And we'll do our example
next time.",00:45:46.820,00:45:48.920
"I'll tell you what
it's going to be.",00:45:48.920,00:45:51.790
"So here's the general formula
for probability here.",00:45:51.790,00:46:04.190
"We're going to imagine that we
have a total range which is",00:46:04.190,00:46:12.120
"maybe going from a to b, and
we have some intermediate",00:46:12.120,00:46:15.470
"values x1 and x2, and then we're
going to try to compute",00:46:15.470,00:46:20.160
"the probability that some
variable that we picked at",00:46:20.160,00:46:27.390
"random occurs between
x1 and x2.",00:46:27.390,00:46:31.560
"And by definition, we're saying
that it's an integral.",00:46:31.560,00:46:36.490
"It's the integral from x1 to x2
of the weight dx, divided",00:46:36.490,00:46:41.720
"by the integral all the
way from a to b.",00:46:41.720,00:46:46.710
Of the weight.,00:46:46.710,00:46:47.390
"So, again, this is the part
divided by the whole.",00:46:47.390,00:46:55.900
"And the relationship between
this and the weighted average",00:46:55.900,00:46:59.890
"that we had earlier was that the
function f ( x) is kind of",00:46:59.890,00:47:03.460
a strange function.,00:47:03.460,00:47:04.450
It's 0 and 1.,00:47:04.450,00:47:06.410
"It's just the picture, if you
like, is that you have this",00:47:06.410,00:47:10.360
weighting factor.,00:47:10.360,00:47:11.860
And it's going from a to b.,00:47:11.860,00:47:14.180
"But then in between there, we
have the part that we're",00:47:14.180,00:47:16.990
interested in.,00:47:16.990,00:47:17.690
Which is between x1 and x2.,00:47:17.690,00:47:20.130
"And it's the ratio of this inner
part to the whole thing",00:47:20.130,00:47:23.910
that we're interested in.,00:47:23.910,00:47:34.650
"Tomorrow I'm going to try to
do a realistic example.",00:47:34.650,00:47:39.660
"And I'm going to tell
you what it is, but",00:47:39.660,00:47:41.230
we'll take it up tomorrow.,00:47:41.230,00:47:43.620
"I told you it was going to be
tomorrow, but we still have a",00:47:43.620,00:47:46.470
"whole minute, so I'm going to
tell you what the problem is.",00:47:46.470,00:47:49.270
"So this is going to be a target
practice problem.",00:47:49.270,00:47:53.660
"You have a target here
and you're throwing",00:47:53.660,00:47:55.610
darts at this target.,00:47:55.610,00:48:00.810
"And so you're throwing
darts at this target.",00:48:00.810,00:48:05.960
"And somebody is standing
next to the dartboard.",00:48:05.960,00:48:13.020
"Your little brother is
standing next to",00:48:13.020,00:48:15.400
the dartboard here.,00:48:15.400,00:48:18.160
"And the question is, how likely
you are to hit your",00:48:18.160,00:48:23.440
little brother.,00:48:23.440,00:48:24.320
"So this will, let's see.",00:48:24.320,00:48:27.190
"You'll see whether you
like that or not.",00:48:27.190,00:48:28.500
"Actually, I was the
little brother.",00:48:28.500,00:48:30.000
"So, I don't know which
way you want to go.",00:48:30.000,00:48:31.710
