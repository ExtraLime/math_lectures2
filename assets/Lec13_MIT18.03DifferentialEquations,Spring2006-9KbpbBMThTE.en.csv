"The task for today is to find
particular solutions.",00:00:05.000,00:00:09.242
"So, let me remind you where
we've gotten to.",00:00:09.242,00:00:12.890
"We're talking about the
second-order equation with",00:00:12.890,00:00:17.048
"constant coefficients,
which you can think of as",00:00:17.048,00:00:21.036
"modeling springs,
or simple electrical circuits.",00:00:21.036,00:00:25.024
"But, what's different now is
that the right-hand side is an",00:00:25.024,00:00:29.945
"input which is not zero.
So, we are considering,",00:00:29.945,00:00:35.367
"I'm going to use x as your book
does, keeping to a neutral",00:00:35.367,00:00:41.235
"letter.
But, again, in the",00:00:41.235,00:00:43.808
"applications,
and in many of the applications",00:00:43.808,00:00:48.338
"at any rate, it wants to be t.
But, I make it x.",00:00:48.338,00:00:54.000
"So, the independent variable is
x, and the problem is,",00:00:54.000,00:00:59.799
"remember, that to find a
particular solution,",00:00:59.799,00:01:04.613
"and the reason why we want to
do that is then the general",00:01:04.613,00:01:10.741
"solution will be of the form y
equals that particular solution",00:01:10.741,00:01:17.416
"plus the complementary solution,
the general solution to the",00:01:17.416,00:01:23.872
"reduced equation,
which we can write this way.",00:01:23.872,00:01:30.000
"So, all the work depends upon
finding out what that yp is,",00:01:30.000,00:01:34.141
"and that's what we're going to
talk about today,",00:01:34.141,00:01:37.556
"or rather, talk about for two
weeks.",00:01:37.556,00:01:40.099
"But, the point is,
not all functions that you",00:01:40.099,00:01:43.296
"could write on the right-hand
side are equally interesting.",00:01:43.296,00:01:47.510
"There's one kind,
which is far more interesting,",00:01:47.510,00:01:50.925
"but more important in the
applications than all the",00:01:50.925,00:01:54.558
"others.
And, that's the one out of",00:01:54.558,00:01:56.956
"which, in fact,
as you will see later on this",00:01:56.956,00:02:00.152
"week and into next week,
an arbitrary function can be",00:02:00.152,00:02:03.931
"built out of these simple
functions.",00:02:03.931,00:02:08.000
"So, the important function is
on the right-hand side to be",00:02:08.000,00:02:13.199
"able to solve it when it's a
simple exponential.",00:02:13.199,00:02:17.486
"But, if you allow me to make it
a complex exponential,",00:02:17.486,00:02:22.320
"so, here are the important
right-hand sides where we want,",00:02:22.320,00:02:27.520
"we want to be able to do it
when it's of the form,",00:02:27.520,00:02:31.989
"e to the ax.
In general, that will be,",00:02:31.989,00:02:36.744
"in most applications,
a is not a growing exponential,",00:02:36.744,00:02:40.372
"but a decaying exponential.
So, typically,",00:02:40.372,00:02:43.232
"a is negative.
But, it doesn't have to be.",00:02:43.232,00:02:46.093
"I'll put it in parentheses,
though, often.",00:02:46.093,00:02:48.953
"That's not any assumption that
I'm going to make today.",00:02:48.953,00:02:52.720
"It's just culture.
But, we want to be able to do",00:02:52.720,00:02:56.000
"it for sine omega x and cosine
omega x.",00:02:56.000,00:02:59.906
"In other words,",00:02:59.906,00:03:03.150
"when the right-hand side is a
pure oscillation,",00:03:03.150,00:03:06.680
"that's another important type
of input both for electrical",00:03:06.680,00:03:11.053
"circuits, think alternating
current, or the spring systems.",00:03:11.053,00:03:15.503
"That's a pure vibration is
you're imposing pure vibration",00:03:15.503,00:03:19.800
"on the spring-mass-dashpot
system, and you want to see how",00:03:19.800,00:03:24.173
"it responds to that.
Or, you could put them",00:03:24.173,00:03:27.396
"together, and make these
decaying oscillations.",00:03:27.396,00:03:32.000
"So, we could also have
something like e to the ax times",00:03:32.000,00:03:36.724
"sine omega x,
or times cosine omega x.",00:03:36.724,00:03:41.974
"Now, the point is,",00:03:41.974,00:03:45.037
"all of these together are
really just special cases of one",00:03:45.037,00:03:50.025
"general thing,
exponential,",00:03:50.025,00:03:52.300
"if you allow the exponent not
to be a real number,",00:03:52.300,00:03:56.587
"but to be a complex number.
So, they're all special cases",00:03:56.587,00:04:02.918
"of e to the, I'll write it alpha
x,",00:04:02.918,00:04:07.949
"well, why don't we write it (a
plus i omega) x, right?",00:04:07.949,00:04:14.088
"If omega is zero,",00:04:14.088,00:04:16.905
"then I've got this case.
If a is zero,",00:04:16.905,00:04:20.628
"I got this case separating into
its real and imaginary parts.",00:04:20.628,00:04:26.666
"And, if neither is zero,
I have this case.",00:04:26.666,00:04:32.000
"But, I don't want to keep
writing (a plus i omega) all the",00:04:32.000,00:04:36.247
"time.
So, I'm going to write that",00:04:36.247,00:04:38.631
simply as e to the alpha x.,00:04:38.631,00:04:41.760
"And, you understand that alpha
is a complex number now.",00:04:41.760,00:04:45.784
"It doesn't look like a real
number.",00:04:45.784,00:04:48.317
"Okay, so the complex number.
So, the equation we are solving",00:04:48.317,00:04:52.713
"is which one?
This pretty purple equation.",00:04:52.713,00:04:55.768
"And, we are trying to find a
particular solution of it.",00:04:55.768,00:04:59.792
"And, the special functions we
are going to use are these,",00:04:59.792,00:05:03.964
"well, this one in particular,
e to the alpha x.",00:05:03.964,00:05:08.137
That's going to be our input.,00:05:08.137,00:05:13.426
"Now, it turns out this is
amazingly easy to do because",00:05:13.426,00:05:19.687
"it's an exponential because I
write it in exponential form.",00:05:19.687,00:05:26.540
"The idea is simply to use a
rule which, in fact,",00:05:26.540,00:05:32.092
"you know already,
the rule of substitution.",00:05:32.092,00:05:38.000
"So, I'm going to write the
equation in the form,",00:05:38.000,00:05:43.600
"so, there it is.
It's y double prime plus A y",00:05:43.600,00:05:48.842
prime plus B y equals f of x.,00:05:48.842,00:05:55.276
"But, I'm going to think of the
left-hand side as the polynomial",00:05:55.276,00:06:02.663
"operator, AD plus B.
A and B are constants,",00:06:02.663,00:06:07.696
applied to y equals f of x.,00:06:07.696,00:06:10.705
"That's the way I write the
thing.",00:06:10.705,00:06:13.173
"And, this part,
I'm going to think of in the",00:06:13.173,00:06:16.490
"form.
This is p of D,",00:06:16.490,00:06:18.033
"a polynomial in D.
In fact, it's a simple",00:06:18.033,00:06:21.118
"quadratic polynomial.
But, most of what I'm going to",00:06:21.118,00:06:25.052
"say today would apply equally
well if we were a higher order",00:06:25.052,00:06:29.603
"polynomial, a polynomial of
higher degree.",00:06:29.603,00:06:34.000
"And, just to reinforce the
idea, I've given you one problem",00:06:34.000,00:06:38.043
"in your problem set when p is a
polynomial of higher degree.",00:06:38.043,00:06:42.156
"I should say,
the notes are written for",00:06:42.156,00:06:44.805
"general polynomials,
not just for quadratic ones.",00:06:44.805,00:06:48.151
"I'm simplifying it by leaving
it, today, I'll do what's in the",00:06:48.151,00:06:52.403
"notes, but I'll do it in the
quadratic case to save a little",00:06:52.403,00:06:56.516
"time, and because that's the one
you will be most concerned with",00:06:56.516,00:07:00.908
"in the problems.
All right, so p of D y equals f",00:07:00.908,00:07:05.657
"of x.
And now, there are just a",00:07:05.657,00:07:09.771
"couple of basic formulas that
we're going to use all the time.",00:07:09.771,00:07:15.000
"The first is that if you apply
p of D to a complex",00:07:15.000,00:07:19.971
"exponential, or a real one,
it doesn't matter,",00:07:19.971,00:07:23.828
"the answer is you get just what
you started with,",00:07:23.828,00:07:27.942
"with D substituted by alpha.
So, it's p of alpha.",00:07:27.942,00:07:32.057
"In other words,
put an alpha wherever you saw a",00:07:32.057,00:07:36.000
"D in the polynomial.
And, what is this?",00:07:36.000,00:07:40.268
"Well, this is now just an
ordinary complex number,",00:07:40.268,00:07:43.721
"and multiply that by what you
started with,",00:07:43.721,00:07:46.681
e to the alpha x.,00:07:46.681,00:07:48.936
"So, that's a basic formula.
It's called in the notes the",00:07:48.936,00:07:52.812
"substitution rule because the
heart of it is,",00:07:52.812,00:07:55.912
"you substitute for the D,
you substitute alpha.",00:07:55.912,00:08:00.000
"Now, this hardly requires
proof.",00:08:00.000,00:08:02.540
"But, let's prove it just so you
see, to reinforce things and",00:08:02.540,00:08:07.377
"make things go a little more
slowly to make sure you are on",00:08:07.377,00:08:12.131
"board all the time.
How would I prove that?",00:08:12.131,00:08:15.573
"Well, just calculate it out,
what in fact is (D squared plus",00:08:15.573,00:08:20.409
"AD plus B) times e to the alpha
x.",00:08:20.409,00:08:25.491
"Well, it's D squared e to the
alpha x by linearity plus AD",00:08:25.491,00:08:30.163
"times e to the alpha x plus B
times e to the alpha x.",00:08:30.163,00:08:34.426
"Well, what are these?
What's the derivative of e to",00:08:40.000,00:08:43.139
"the alpha x?
It's just alpha times e to the",00:08:43.139,00:08:46.780
"alpha x.
What's a second derivative?",00:08:46.780,00:08:50.358
"Well, if you remember from the
exam, you can do tenth",00:08:50.358,00:08:53.623
"derivatives now.
So, the second derivative is",00:08:53.623,00:08:56.385
"easy.
It's alpha squared times e to",00:08:56.385,00:08:58.520
the alpha x.,00:08:58.520,00:09:00.717
"In other words,
this law, what I'm saying",00:09:00.717,00:09:03.228
"really is that this law is
obviously, quote unquote,",00:09:03.228,00:09:06.430
"""true.""
Okay, I'm not even going to put",00:09:06.430,00:09:10.170
"it in quotes.
It's obviously true for the",00:09:10.170,00:09:12.971
"operator, D, and the operator D
squared.",00:09:12.971,00:09:16.263
"In other words,
D of e to the alpha x equals",00:09:16.263,00:09:19.274
alpha times e to the alpha x.,00:09:19.274,00:09:22.495
D squared times e to the alpha,00:09:22.495,00:09:25.997
"x equals alpha squared times e
to the alpha x.",00:09:25.997,00:09:30.128
"And, therefore,",00:09:30.128,00:09:34.118
"it's true for linear
combinations of these as well by",00:09:34.118,00:09:37.997
"linearity.
So, therefore,",00:09:37.997,00:09:39.787
"also true for p of D.
And, in fact,",00:09:39.787,00:09:42.994
"so if you calculate it out,
what is it?",00:09:42.994,00:09:45.828
"This is alpha squared e to the
alpha x plus alpha e to the",00:09:45.828,00:09:50.080
alpha x times the,00:09:50.080,00:09:54.555
"coefficient plus b times e to
the alpha x.",00:09:54.555,00:10:00.000
"So, it's in fact exactly this.
It's e to the alpha x times",00:10:00.000,00:10:04.950
"(alpha squared plus A alpha plus
B).",00:10:04.950,00:10:10.247
"Now, how are we going to use",00:10:10.247,00:10:13.807
"this?
Well, the idea is very simple.",00:10:13.807,00:10:16.847
"Remember, we're trying to solve
this, I should have some",00:10:16.847,00:10:21.623
"consistent notation for these
equations.",00:10:21.623,00:10:25.010
"Purple, I think,
will be the right thing here.",00:10:25.010,00:10:28.918
"You are solving purple
equations.",00:10:28.918,00:10:33.000
"The formulas which will solve
them will be orange formulas,",00:10:33.000,00:10:38.289
"and we will see what we need as
we go along.",00:10:38.289,00:10:42.210
"So, I would like to just
formulate it,",00:10:42.210,00:10:45.584
"this solution,
the particular solution now.",00:10:45.584,00:10:49.415
"I'm going to call it a theorem.
It's really too simple to be a",00:10:49.415,00:10:54.977
"theorem.
On the other hand,",00:10:54.977,00:10:57.349
"it's too important not to be a
theorem.",00:10:57.349,00:11:02.000
"So, let's call it,
as I called it in the notes,",00:11:02.000,00:11:06.683
"the exponential input theorem,
which says it all.",00:11:06.683,00:11:11.570
"Theorem says it's important.
Exponential input means it's",00:11:11.570,00:11:17.272
"taking f of x to be an
exponential.",00:11:17.272,00:11:21.650
"It's an exponential input,
and the theorem tells you what",00:11:21.650,00:11:27.352
"the response is.
So, for that equation,",00:11:27.352,00:11:33.330
"I'm not going to recopy the
equation for the purple",00:11:33.330,00:11:40.899
"equation, adequately indicated
this way.",00:11:40.899,00:11:46.802
"There.
Now try to take notes.",00:11:46.802,00:11:51.041
"For the purple equation,
a solution is e to the alpha x.",00:11:51.041,00:11:59.215
Somewhere I neglected to say,00:11:59.215,00:12:05.391
"that f of x, all right,
so for the purple equals e to",00:12:05.391,00:12:09.831
"the alpha x, how about that?",00:12:09.831,00:12:14.101
"That equation,
y double prime plus a y prime",00:12:14.101,00:12:17.774
"plus b y equals e to
the alpha x.",00:12:17.774,00:12:22.812
"So, here's the exponential",00:12:22.812,00:12:25.460
"input.
The solution is e to the alpha",00:12:25.460,00:12:28.534
x divided by p of alpha.,00:12:28.534,00:12:34.000
"Now, that's a very useful
formula.",00:12:34.000,00:12:36.649
"In fact, Haynes Miller,
who also teaches this course,",00:12:36.649,00:12:40.823
"in his notes calls of the most
important theorem in the course.",00:12:40.823,00:12:45.800
"Well, I don't have to totally
agree with him,",00:12:45.800,00:12:49.332
"but it's certainly important.
It's probably the most",00:12:49.332,00:12:53.426
"important theorem for these two
weeks, anyway.",00:12:53.426,00:12:57.038
"But, you will have others as
well.",00:12:57.038,00:12:59.688
"Okay, so that's a theorem.
The theorem is going green.",00:12:59.688,00:13:03.942
"You can tell what they are by
their color code.",00:13:03.942,00:13:09.000
"Well, in other words,
what I've done is simply write",00:13:09.000,00:13:12.923
"down the solution for you,
write down the particular",00:13:12.923,00:13:16.846
"solution.
But let's verify it in general.",00:13:16.846,00:13:19.923
"So, the proof would be what?
Well, I have to substitute it",00:13:19.923,00:13:24.307
"into the equation.
So, the equation is p of D",00:13:24.307,00:13:27.692
"applied to y is equal to alpha
x.",00:13:27.692,00:13:31.000
"And, I want to know,
when I substitute that",00:13:31.000,00:13:34.239
"expression in,
is it the case that when I plug",00:13:34.239,00:13:37.710
"it in, that the right-hand side,
I calculate it out,",00:13:37.710,00:13:41.643
"apply p of D to it.
Is it the case that I get e to",00:13:41.643,00:13:46.117
the alpha x on the right?,00:13:46.117,00:13:49.202
"Well, all you have to do is do
it.",00:13:49.202,00:13:51.747
"What is p of D applied to e to
the alpha x divided by p of",00:13:51.747,00:13:56.143
alpha?,00:13:56.143,00:14:00.000
"Well, p of D applied to e to
the alpha x is p of alpha times",00:14:00.000,00:14:03.735
e to the alpha x.,00:14:03.735,00:14:07.534
"That's the substitution rule.
What about this guy?",00:14:07.534,00:14:10.636
"This guy is a constant,
so it just gets dragged along",00:14:10.636,00:14:13.929
"because this operator is linear.
If this applied to that is",00:14:13.929,00:14:17.601
"this, then if I apply it to one
half that, I get one half the",00:14:17.601,00:14:21.400
"answer, and so on.
So, the p of alpha",00:14:21.400,00:14:24.502
"is a constant and just gets
dragged along.",00:14:24.502,00:14:27.098
"And now, they cancel each
other, and the answer is,",00:14:27.098,00:14:30.264
"indeed, e to the alpha x.",00:14:30.264,00:14:34.000
"That's not much of a proof.
I hope that to at least half",00:14:34.000,00:14:39.500
"this class, you're wondering,
yes, but what if Peter had not",00:14:39.500,00:14:45.399
"caught the wolf?
I mean, what if?",00:14:45.399,00:14:48.600
What if?,00:14:48.600,00:14:50.000
"I'm looking stern.
Okay, we will take care of it",00:15:01.000,00:15:04.992
"in the simplest possible way.
We will assume that p of alpha",00:15:04.992,00:15:10.004
"is not zero.
The case p of alpha is zero",00:15:10.004,00:15:13.317
"is, in fact,
an extremely important",00:15:13.317,00:15:17.650
"case, one that makes the world
go 'round, one that contributes",00:15:17.650,00:15:22.832
"to all sorts of catastrophes,
and they occur first here in",00:15:22.832,00:15:27.674
"the solution of differential
equations, and that's what",00:15:27.674,00:15:32.262
"controls all the catastrophes.
But, there's a good side to it,",00:15:32.262,00:15:37.792
"too.
It also makes a lot of good",00:15:37.792,00:15:39.585
"things happen.
So, there are no moral",00:15:39.585,00:15:41.667
"judgments in mathematics.
For the time being,",00:15:41.667,00:15:44.212
"let's assume p of alpha is not
zero.",00:15:44.212,00:15:46.236
"And, that proof is okay because
the p of alpha,",00:15:46.236,00:15:48.896
"being in the denominator,
it's okay to be in the",00:15:48.896,00:15:51.614
"denominator if you're not zero.
Okay, let's work in a simple",00:15:51.614,00:15:55.026
"example.
Well, I'm picking the most",00:15:55.026,00:15:56.992
"complicated example I can think
of.",00:15:56.992,00:16:00.000
"Simple examples,
I'll leave for your practice",00:16:00.000,00:16:04.249
"and for the recitations,
can start off with simple",00:16:04.249,00:16:08.981
"examples if you are confused by
this.",00:16:08.981,00:16:12.457
"But, let's solve an equation,
find a particular solution.",00:16:12.457,00:16:17.866
"So, y double prime plus minus y
prime plus 2y is equal to 10 e",00:16:17.866,00:16:23.757
to the minus x sine x.,00:16:23.757,00:16:29.358
"Gulp.
Okay, so, the input is this",00:16:29.358,00:16:33.055
"function, 10 e to the minus x,",00:16:33.055,00:16:36.328
"it's a decaying oscillation.
You're seeing those already on",00:16:36.328,00:16:40.742
"the computer screen if you
started your homework,",00:16:40.742,00:16:44.396
"if you've done problem one on
your homework.",00:16:44.396,00:16:47.669
"It's a decaying exponential,
and I want to find a particular",00:16:47.669,00:16:52.160
"solution.
Well, let's find a particular",00:16:52.160,00:16:55.052
"and the general solution.
Find the general solution.",00:16:55.052,00:17:00.000
"Well, the main part of the work
is finding the particular",00:17:00.000,00:17:05.442
"solution, but let's quickly,
the general solution,",00:17:05.442,00:17:10.203
"let's find first the
complementary part of it,",00:17:10.203,00:17:14.576
"in other words,
the solution to the homogeneous",00:17:14.576,00:17:19.047
"equation.
That's D squared minus D plus",00:17:19.047,00:17:22.739
"two. No, let's not.",00:17:22.739,00:17:26.043
"I don't want to solve messy
quadratics.",00:17:26.043,00:17:31.000
"Okay, we're going to find a
particular solution.",00:17:31.000,00:17:34.877
"I thought it was going to come
out easy, and then I realized it",00:17:34.877,00:17:39.992
"wasn't because I picked the
wrong signs.",00:17:39.992,00:17:43.210
"Okay, so if you don't like,
just change the problem.",00:17:43.210,00:17:47.417
"I can do that,
but you cannot.",00:17:47.417,00:17:49.809
"Don't forget that.
So, we want a particular",00:17:49.809,00:17:53.275
"solution in our equation.
It is this equals that.",00:17:53.275,00:17:57.234
"Now, let's complexify it to
make this part of a complex",00:17:57.234,00:18:01.690
"exponential.
So, the complex exponential",00:18:01.690,00:18:06.603
"that's relevant is ten times e
to the (minus one plus i),",00:18:06.603,00:18:12.002
you see that? x.,00:18:12.002,00:18:15.473
"What is this?
This is the imaginary part of",00:18:15.473,00:18:19.523
"this complex exponential.
So, this is imaginary part of",00:18:19.523,00:18:24.730
"that guy, e to the negative x
times e to the i x,",00:18:24.730,00:18:29.261
and the imaginary part of e to,00:18:29.261,00:18:33.889
the i x.,00:18:33.889,00:18:39.000
"The ten, of course,
just comes along for the ride.",00:18:39.000,00:18:42.238
"Okay, well, now,
since this is a complex",00:18:42.238,00:18:44.816
"equation, I shouldn't call this
y anymore by my notation.",00:18:44.816,00:18:48.517
"I like to call it y tilde to
indicate that the solution we",00:18:48.517,00:18:52.284
"get to this is not going to be
the original solution to the",00:18:52.284,00:18:56.117
"original problem,
but you will have to take the",00:18:56.117,00:18:59.158
"imaginary part of it to get it.
So, we are looking,",00:18:59.158,00:19:03.511
"now, for the complex solution
to this complexified equation.",00:19:03.511,00:19:08.204
"Okay, what is it?
Well, the complex particular",00:19:08.204,00:19:11.784
"solution I can write down
immediately.",00:19:11.784,00:19:14.727
"It is ten, that,
of course, just gets dragged",00:19:14.727,00:19:18.227
"along by linearity,
times e to the (minus one plus",00:19:18.227,00:19:22.125
"i) times x.
And, it's over this polynomial",00:19:22.125,00:19:27.056
"evaluated at this alpha.
So, just write it down with,",00:19:27.056,00:19:31.952
"have faith.
So, what do I get?",00:19:31.952,00:19:33.974
The alpha is minus one plus i.,00:19:33.974,00:19:36.762
"I.
square that,",00:19:36.762,00:19:37.739
"because I'm substituting this
alpha into that polynomial.",00:19:37.739,00:19:41.643
"The reason I'm doing that is
because the formula tells me to",00:19:41.643,00:19:45.756
"do it.
That's going to be that",00:19:45.756,00:19:47.778
"solution.
Okay, so it's minus one plus i,",00:19:47.778,00:19:50.567
"the quantity squared, minus
minus one plus i plus two.",00:19:50.567,00:19:54.193
All I've done is substitute,00:19:54.193,00:19:58.167
"minus one plus i for
D in that polynomial,",00:19:58.167,00:20:01.792
"the quadratic polynomial.
And now, all I want is the",00:20:01.792,00:20:07.534
"imaginary part of this.
The imaginary part of this will",00:20:07.534,00:20:12.797
"be the solution to the original
problem because this was the",00:20:12.797,00:20:18.548
"right hand side with the
imaginary part of the",00:20:18.548,00:20:22.935
"complexified right hand side.
Okay, now, let's make it look a",00:20:22.935,00:20:28.783
"little better,
yp tilde.",00:20:28.783,00:20:32.000
"Clearly, what we have to do
something nice to the",00:20:32.000,00:20:34.902
"denominator.
So, I'll copy the numerator.",00:20:34.902,00:20:37.321
"That's e to the minus (one plus
i) x",00:20:37.321,00:20:40.466
"and how about the denominator?
Well, again,",00:20:40.466,00:20:43.006
"don't expand things out because
it's already this long.",00:20:43.006,00:20:46.272
"And, what's the point of making
it this long?",00:20:46.272,00:20:48.933
"You want to make it as long,
right?",00:20:48.933,00:20:50.989
"Okay, then there is room here
for one real number,",00:20:50.989,00:20:53.952
"and another real number times
i, there's no more room.",00:20:53.952,00:20:57.157
"Okay, what's the real number?
Okay, we're looking for the",00:20:57.157,00:21:02.295
"real part of this expression.
So, just put it in and keep it",00:21:02.295,00:21:07.309
"mentally.
So, minus one squared:",00:21:07.309,00:21:09.944
"that's one, plus i squared,
that's minus one.",00:21:09.944,00:21:13.684
"One minus one is zero.
I can forget about that term.",00:21:13.684,00:21:18.019
"The term gives me plus one for
the real part,",00:21:18.019,00:21:21.759
"plus two.
The answer is that the real",00:21:21.759,00:21:24.819
"part is three.
How about the imaginary part?",00:21:24.819,00:21:28.474
"Well, from here,
there's negative 2i,",00:21:28.474,00:21:31.535
"negative 2i.
I'm expanding that out by the",00:21:31.535,00:21:38.008
"binomial theorem,
or whatever you like to call",00:21:38.008,00:21:44.227
"that, minus 2i minus i makes
minus 3i.",00:21:44.227,00:21:51.829
"Is that right?
Minus 2i, minus i,",00:21:51.829,00:21:56.252
"minus 3i.
So, it is ten thirds,",00:21:56.252,00:22:00.398
"and now in the denominator I
have one minus i.",00:22:00.398,00:22:08.000
"I'll put that in the numerator,
make it one plus i,",00:22:08.000,00:22:12.456
"but I have to divide by the
product of one minus i and its",00:22:12.456,00:22:17.537
"complex conjugate.
In other words,",00:22:17.537,00:22:20.479
"I'm multiplying both top and
bottom by one plus i.",00:22:20.479,00:22:24.846
"And so, that makes here one
squared plus one squared is two.",00:22:24.846,00:22:30.105
"And now, what's left is e to
the negative x times cosine x",00:22:30.105,00:22:35.186
plus i sine x.,00:22:35.186,00:22:40.000
"Now, of that,
what we want is just the",00:22:40.000,00:22:43.775
"imaginary part.
Well, let's see.",00:22:43.775,00:22:46.938
"Two goes into ten makes five,
so that's five thirds.",00:22:46.938,00:22:52.142
"So, we're practically at our
solution.",00:22:52.142,00:22:55.918
"The solution,
then, finally,",00:22:55.918,00:22:58.673
"is going to be yp is the
imaginary part of yp tilde.",00:22:58.673,00:23:05.000
"And, what's that?
Well, what's the coefficient",00:23:05.000,00:23:08.796
"out front, first of all?
It's five thirds,",00:23:08.796,00:23:12.255
"so let's pull out to five
thirds before we forget it.",00:23:12.255,00:23:16.641
"And, we'll pull out the e to
the negative x before we forget",00:23:16.641,00:23:21.619
"that.
And then, the rest is simply a",00:23:21.619,00:23:24.572
"question of seeing what's left.
Well, it's one.",00:23:24.572,00:23:28.452
"I want the imaginary part.
So, the imaginary part is going",00:23:28.452,00:23:33.261
"to be one times cosine x,
and then the other",00:23:33.261,00:23:37.816
"imaginary part comes from these
two pieces, which is one times",00:23:37.816,00:23:42.962
"sine x.
And, that should be the",00:23:42.962,00:23:47.957
"particular solution.
Notice that most of the work is",00:23:47.957,00:23:52.297
"not getting this thing.
It's turning it into something",00:23:52.297,00:23:56.808
"human that you can take the real
and imaginary parts of.",00:23:56.808,00:24:02.000
"If we don't like this form,
you can put it in the other",00:24:02.000,00:24:07.142
"form, which many engineers would
do almost automatically,",00:24:07.142,00:24:12.476
"make it five thirds,
e to the negative x,",00:24:12.476,00:24:16.285
"and what will that be?
Well, you can use the general",00:24:16.285,00:24:21.142
"formula if you want.
Remember, cosine,",00:24:21.142,00:24:24.666
"the two coefficients are one
and one, so it's one and one.",00:24:24.666,00:24:30.095
"So, this is the square root of
two.",00:24:30.095,00:24:33.333
"So, it is times,
this part makes the square root",00:24:33.333,00:24:37.809
"of two times cosine of x minus
pi over the angle.",00:24:37.809,00:24:44.000
"This is a phi.
So, that's pi over four,",00:24:44.000,00:24:47.220
minus pi over four.,00:24:47.220,00:24:49.000
"Okay, all right,
now let's address the case",00:24:58.000,00:25:02.283
"which is going to occupy a lot
of the rest of today,",00:25:02.283,00:25:07.484
"and in a certain sense,
all of next time.",00:25:07.484,00:25:11.563
"What happens when p of alpha is
zero?",00:25:11.563,00:25:16.968
"Well, in order to be able to
handle this decently,",00:25:16.968,00:25:21.966
"it's necessary to have one more
formula, which is very slightly",00:25:21.966,00:25:28.288
"more complicated than the
substitution rule.",00:25:28.288,00:25:34.000
"But, it's the same kind of
rule.",00:25:34.000,00:25:36.014
"I'm going to call this,
or it is called the",00:25:36.014,00:25:38.744
"exponential.
So, I'm going to first prove a",00:25:38.744,00:25:41.473
"formula, which is the analog of
that, and then I will prove a",00:25:41.473,00:25:45.373
"green formula,
which is what to do here if p",00:25:45.373,00:25:48.167
of alpha turns out to be zero.,00:25:48.167,00:25:51.157
"But, in order to be able to
prove that, we're going to be",00:25:51.157,00:25:54.796
"the analog of the orange
formula.",00:25:54.796,00:25:56.876
"And, the analogue of the orange
formula, that tells you how to",00:25:56.876,00:26:00.840
"apply p of D to a
simple exponential.",00:26:00.840,00:26:05.000
"I need a formula which applies
p of D to that simple",00:26:05.000,00:26:11.302
"exponential times another
function.",00:26:11.302,00:26:14.873
"Now, I found I got into trouble
by continuing to call that",00:26:14.873,00:26:20.861
"alpha.
So, I'm now going to change the",00:26:20.861,00:26:24.747
"name of alpha to change alpha's
name to a.",00:26:24.747,00:26:30.000
"But, it's still complex.
I don't mean it's guaranteed to",00:26:30.000,00:26:34.703
"be complex.
I mean it's allowed to be",00:26:34.703,00:26:37.782
"complex.
So, a is now allowed to be a",00:26:37.782,00:26:40.861
"complex number.
I'm thinking of it,",00:26:40.861,00:26:43.769
"in general, as a complex
number, okay?",00:26:43.769,00:26:46.934
"I hope this doesn't upset you
too much, but you know,",00:26:46.934,00:26:51.381
"you change x to t's,
and y's to x's.",00:26:51.381,00:26:54.375
"This is no worse.
All right, what we going to do?",00:26:54.375,00:26:58.480
"Well, I'm going to use this
exponential shift rule,",00:26:58.480,00:27:02.756
"I'll call it,
exponential shift rule or",00:27:02.756,00:27:06.006
"formula or law.
That's the substitution rule",00:27:06.006,00:27:11.402
"for me.
So, this is going to be",00:27:11.402,00:27:13.977
"exponential shift law.
And, to apply,",00:27:13.977,00:27:17.067
"it tells you how to apply the
polynomial to not D,",00:27:17.067,00:27:21.272
"not just the exponential,
but the exponential times some",00:27:21.272,00:27:25.992
"function of x.
What's that?",00:27:25.992,00:27:28.223
"And now, the rule is very
simple.",00:27:28.223,00:27:32.000
"See, you can understand the
difficulty.",00:27:32.000,00:27:34.616
"If you try to start
differentiating,",00:27:34.616,00:27:37.025
"you're going to have to
calculate second derivatives of",00:27:37.025,00:27:40.743
"the stuff, and God forbid,
higher order equations.",00:27:40.743,00:27:44.117
"You would have to calculate
fourth derivatives,",00:27:44.117,00:27:47.283
"fifth derivatives.
You barely even want to",00:27:47.283,00:27:50.106
"calculate the first derivative.
That's okay.",00:27:50.106,00:27:53.067
"But, second derivative,
do I have to?",00:27:53.067,00:27:55.545
"No, not if you know the
exponential shift rule,",00:27:55.545,00:27:58.712
"which says you can get rid of
the e to the ax,",00:27:58.712,00:28:01.810
"make it pass to the left of the
operator where it's not in any",00:28:01.810,00:28:06.010
"position to do any harm any
longer, or upset the",00:28:06.010,00:28:09.246
"differentiation.
And, all you have to do is,",00:28:09.246,00:28:14.090
"when it passes over that
operator, it changes D to D plus",00:28:14.090,00:28:18.427
"a. So, the answer is,",00:28:18.427,00:28:21.215
"e to the ax.
There, it's passed over.",00:28:21.215,00:28:24.855
"But, when it did so,
it changed D to D plus a.",00:28:24.855,00:28:28.340
"And, what about the u?
Well, the u just stayed there.",00:28:28.340,00:28:32.367
"Nothing happened to it.
Okay, there's our orange",00:28:32.367,00:28:36.945
"formula.
I guess we better put the thing",00:28:36.945,00:28:40.108
"around the whole business.
Should I prove that,",00:28:40.108,00:28:43.837
"or the proof is quite easy.
So, let's do it just again to",00:28:43.837,00:28:48.378
"give you a chance to try to see,
now, if somebody gives you a",00:28:48.378,00:28:53.243
"formula like that,
you first stare at it.",00:28:53.243,00:28:56.486
"You might try a couple of
special cases,",00:28:56.486,00:28:59.648
"try it on a function and see if
it works, but already,",00:28:59.648,00:29:03.945
"you probably don't want to do
that.",00:29:03.945,00:29:08.000
"I mean, even if you took a
function like x here,",00:29:08.000,00:29:10.909
"you'd have to do a certain
amount of differentiating,",00:29:10.909,00:29:14.128
"and some quadratic thing here.
You'd calculate and calculate",00:29:14.128,00:29:17.780
"away for a little while,
and then if you did it",00:29:17.780,00:29:20.628
"correctly, the two would in fact
turn out to be equal.",00:29:20.628,00:29:23.909
"But, you would not necessarily
feel any the wiser.",00:29:23.909,00:29:26.942
"A better procedure in trying to
understand something like this",00:29:26.942,00:29:30.719
"is say, well,
let's keep the u general.",00:29:30.719,00:29:34.000
"Suppose we make D simple.
For example,",00:29:34.000,00:29:36.328
"well, if D is a constant,
of course there's nothing to",00:29:36.328,00:29:39.664
"happen because if this is just a
constant, both sides of these",00:29:39.664,00:29:43.503
"are the same.
This doesn't make any sense if",00:29:43.503,00:29:46.209
"p doesn't really have a D in it.
Well, what's the simplest",00:29:46.209,00:29:49.797
"polynomial which would have a D
in it?",00:29:49.797,00:29:52.125
"Well, D itself.
So, let's take a special case.",00:29:52.125,00:29:54.958
"p of D equals D,
and check the formula in that",00:29:54.958,00:29:58.608
"case; see if it works.
So, the formula is asking us,",00:29:58.608,00:30:03.669
"what is D, that's the p of D,
of e to the ax times u?",00:30:03.669,00:30:08.732
I'm not going to put in the,00:30:08.732,00:30:12.230
"variable here because it's just
a waste of chalk.",00:30:12.230,00:30:16.648
"Well, what is that?
I know how to calculate that.",00:30:16.648,00:30:21.066
"I'll use the product rule.
So, it's the derivative.",00:30:21.066,00:30:25.669
"I'll tell you what;
let's do the other order first.",00:30:25.669,00:30:30.271
"So, it's e to the ax times the
derivative of u plus the",00:30:30.271,00:30:35.242
"derivative of e to the ax,
which is a times e to the ax",00:30:35.242,00:30:40.213
times u.,00:30:40.213,00:30:45.000
"Do you follow that?
This is the product rule.",00:30:45.000,00:30:48.027
"It's e to the ax times the
derivative of u plus the",00:30:48.027,00:30:51.467
"derivative of e to the ax,
which is this thing times u,",00:30:51.467,00:30:55.183
the other factor.,00:30:55.183,00:30:58.142
"Now, is that right?
I want to make it look like",00:30:58.142,00:31:01.933
"that.
Well, to make it look like that",00:31:01.933,00:31:04.510
"I should first factor e to the
ax out.",00:31:04.510,00:31:07.947
"And now, what's left?
Well, if I factor e to the ax",00:31:07.947,00:31:11.527
"out, what's left is Du plus au,
which is exactly (D plus a)",00:31:11.527,00:31:15.680
"operating on u,
D u plus a u.",00:31:15.680,00:31:19.474
"Well, hey, that's just what the
formula said it should be.",00:31:19.474,00:31:23.556
"If you make e to the x pass
over D, it changes D to ",00:31:23.556,00:31:27.780
"D plus a.
Okay, now here's the main thing",00:31:27.780,00:31:32.379
"I want to show you.
All right, now,",00:31:32.379,00:31:34.989
"well let's try,
if this is true,",00:31:34.989,00:31:37.368
"also works out for D squared,
then the formula is",00:31:37.368,00:31:41.667
"clearly true by linearity
because an arbitrary p of D",00:31:41.667,00:31:45.658
"is just a linear
combination with constant",00:31:45.658,00:31:49.496
"coefficients of D,
D squared, and that constant",00:31:49.496,00:31:53.027
"thing, which we agreed there was
nothing to prove about.",00:31:53.027,00:31:57.249
"Now, hack, you're a hack if you
take D squared and start",00:31:57.249,00:32:01.471
"calculating the second
derivative of this.",00:32:01.471,00:32:06.000
"Okay, it's question about
hacks.",00:32:06.000,00:32:08.476
"I mean, it's just,
you haven't learned the right",00:32:08.476,00:32:12.230
"thing to do.
Okay, that will work,",00:32:12.230,00:32:14.865
"but it's not what you want to
do.",00:32:14.865,00:32:17.421
"Instead, you bootstrap your way
up.",00:32:17.421,00:32:20.137
"I have already a formula
telling me how to handle this.",00:32:20.137,00:32:24.450
"And, you can be anything.
Look at this not as D squared",00:32:24.450,00:32:28.763
"all by itself.
Calculate, instead,",00:32:28.763,00:32:32.429
D squared e to the ax times u.,00:32:32.429,00:32:36.041
"Think of that as D,
the derivative of the",00:32:36.041,00:32:39.050
derivative of e to the a x u.,00:32:39.050,00:32:42.587
"In other words,
we will do it one step at a",00:32:42.587,00:32:45.747
"time.
But you see now immediately the",00:32:45.747,00:32:48.456
"advantage of this.
What's D of e to the a x u?",00:32:48.456,00:32:51.766
"Well, I just calculated that.",00:32:51.766,00:32:55.152
"Now, don't go back to the
beginning.",00:32:55.152,00:32:57.786
"Don't go back to here.
Use the formula.",00:32:57.786,00:33:02.000
"After all, you worked to
calculate it,",00:33:02.000,00:33:04.926
"or I did.
So, it's D of,",00:33:04.926,00:33:06.745
"and what's this inside?
It's e to the ax times (D plus",00:33:06.745,00:33:10.937
"a) times u.
Well, that looks like a mess,",00:33:10.937,00:33:15.762
"but it isn't because I'm taking
D of e to the ax times",00:33:15.762,00:33:19.954
"something.
And I already know how to take",00:33:19.954,00:33:23.118
"D of e to the ax times
something.",00:33:23.118,00:33:25.649
"It doesn't matter what that
something is.",00:33:25.649,00:33:30.000
"Here, the something was u.
Here, the something is D plus",00:33:30.000,00:33:35.322
"(a times u) operating on u.
But, the principle is the same,",00:33:35.322,00:33:40.935
"and the answer is what?
Well, to take D of e to the ax",00:33:40.935,00:33:46.064
"times something,
you pass the e to the ax over",00:33:46.064,00:33:50.419
"the D.
That changes D to D plus a.",00:33:50.419,00:33:53.903
"And, you apply that to the",00:33:53.903,00:33:57.580
"other guy, which is (D plus a)
applied to u.",00:33:57.580,00:34:03.000
"What's the answer?
e to the a x times (D plus a)",00:34:03.000,00:34:06.743
squared u.,00:34:06.743,00:34:09.292
"It's just what you would have
gotten if you had taken e to the",00:34:09.292,00:34:14.150
"e to the x, pass it over,
and then changed D to D plus a.",00:34:14.150,00:34:18.451
"Now, another advantage to doing",00:34:18.451,00:34:22.194
"it this way is you can see that
this argument is going to",00:34:22.194,00:34:26.654
"generalize to D cubed.
In other words,",00:34:26.654,00:34:31.323
"you would continue on in the
same way by the process of",00:34:31.323,00:34:36.088
"mathematical,
one word, mathematical,",00:34:36.088,00:34:39.264
"begins with an I,
induction.",00:34:39.264,00:34:41.647
"By induction,
you would prove the same",00:34:41.647,00:34:44.911
"formula for the nth derivative.
If you don't know what",00:34:44.911,00:34:49.588
"mathematical induction is,
shame on you.",00:34:49.588,00:34:53.029
"But it's okay.
A lot of you will be able to go",00:34:53.029,00:34:57.000
"through life without ever having
to learn what it is.",00:34:57.000,00:35:03.000
"And, the rest of you will be
computer scientists.",00:35:03.000,00:35:08.897
"Okay, so that's the idea of
this rule.",00:35:08.897,00:35:13.443
"Now, we can use it to calculate
something.",00:35:13.443,00:35:18.481
"Let's see, I'm going to need
green for this,",00:35:18.481,00:35:23.764
"I guess, for our better
formula.",00:35:23.764,00:35:27.573
"The formula,
now, that tells you what to do",00:35:27.573,00:35:32.733
if p of alpha is zero.,00:35:32.733,00:35:39.000
"So, we're trying to solve the
equation, D squared plus A D,",00:35:39.000,00:35:45.616
we are trying to find a,00:35:45.616,00:35:49.794
"particular solution,
e to the ax,",00:35:49.794,00:35:54.785
"let's say.
Remember, a is complex.",00:35:54.785,00:35:58.616
"a could be complex.
It doesn't have to be real.",00:35:58.616,00:36:05.000
"But, the problem is that p of
alpha is zero.",00:36:05.000,00:36:09.519
"How do I get a particular
solution?",00:36:09.519,00:36:12.080
"Well, I will write it down for
you.",00:36:12.080,00:36:14.641
"So, this is part of that
exponential input theorem.",00:36:14.641,00:36:18.407
"I think that's the way it is in
the notes.",00:36:18.407,00:36:21.496
"I gave all the cases together,
but I thought pedagogically",00:36:21.496,00:36:25.789
"it's probably a little better to
do the simplest case first,",00:36:25.789,00:36:30.233
"and then build up on the
complexity.",00:36:30.233,00:36:34.000
"So, what's yp?
The answer is yp is e to the a,",00:36:34.000,00:36:38.467
except now you have to multiply,00:36:38.467,00:36:43.443
"it by x out front.
Where have you done something",00:36:43.443,00:36:48.215
"like that before?
Yes, don't tell me.",00:36:48.215,00:36:51.870
"I know you know.
But, what should go in the",00:36:51.870,00:36:56.135
"denominator?
Clearly not p of alpha.",00:36:56.135,00:36:59.587
What goes in the denominator is,00:36:59.587,00:37:04.055
"the derivative.
Okay, but what if p prime of",00:37:04.055,00:37:09.567
"alpha is zero?
Couldn't that happen?",00:37:09.567,00:37:14.426
"Yes, it could happen.
So, we better make cases.",00:37:14.426,00:37:18.644
"This case is,
the case where this is okay",00:37:18.644,00:37:22.312
"corresponds to the case where
we're going to assume that alpha",00:37:22.312,00:37:27.905
"is a simple root,
is a simple root of the",00:37:27.905,00:37:31.573
"polynomial, p.
I don't know what to call the",00:37:31.573,00:37:35.515
"variable, p of D is okay.
A simple zero,",00:37:35.515,00:37:40.321
"in other words,
it's not double.",00:37:40.321,00:37:43.247
"Well, suppose is double.
One of the consequences you",00:37:43.247,00:37:48.061
"will see just in a second,
if it's a simple zero,",00:37:48.061,00:37:52.592
"that means this derivative is
not going to be zero.",00:37:52.592,00:37:57.312
"That's automatic.
Yeah, well, suppose it's not as",00:37:57.312,00:38:01.843
"simple.
Well, suppose is a double root.",00:38:01.843,00:38:05.430
"How did a-- How did that get
changed to, argh!",00:38:05.430,00:38:11.000
"[LAUGHTER] That's not an alpha.
Oh, well, yes it is,",00:38:11.000,00:38:16.434
"obviously.
Change!",00:38:16.434,00:38:18.245
"All of you, I want you to
change.",00:38:18.245,00:38:21.655
"They should have something like
in a search key where 147",00:38:21.655,00:38:27.622
"occurrences of alpha have been
changed to a with a stroke of a,",00:38:27.622,00:38:34.229
"just your thumb.
They don't have that for the",00:38:34.229,00:38:39.385
"blackboard, unfortunately.
Well, too bad,",00:38:39.385,00:38:42.792
"for the future.
Correctable blackboards.",00:38:42.792,00:38:46.114
"Well, what if a is double root?
It can't be more than a double",00:38:46.114,00:38:51.311
"root because you've only got a
quadratic polynomial.",00:38:51.311,00:38:55.655
"Quadratic polynomials only have
two roots.",00:38:55.655,00:39:00.000
"So, the worst that can happen
is that both of them are a.",00:39:00.000,00:39:04.630
"All right, in that case the
formula should be yp is equal",00:39:04.630,00:39:09.261
"to, you are now going to need x
squared up there times e ",00:39:09.261,00:39:14.388
"to the ax,
and in the denominator what you",00:39:14.388,00:39:18.440
"are going to need is the second
derivative of,",00:39:18.440,00:39:22.161
"evaluated at a.
Now, you can guess the way this",00:39:22.161,00:39:25.965
"going to go on.
For higher degree things,",00:39:25.965,00:39:29.273
"if you've got a triple root,
you will need here x cubed,",00:39:29.273,00:39:33.738
"except you're going to need a
factorial there,",00:39:37.294,00:39:41.015
"too.
So, don't worry about it.",00:39:41.015,00:39:45.142
"It's in the notes,
but I'm not going to give you",00:39:45.142,00:39:49.171
"that for higher roots.
I don't even know if I will",00:39:49.171,00:39:53.371
"give it to you for double root.
Yes, I already did,",00:39:53.371,00:39:57.657
"so it's too late.
It's too late.",00:39:57.657,00:40:01.000
"Okay, so we will make this two
formulas according to whether a",00:40:01.000,00:40:06.440
"is a single or a double root.
Okay, let's prove one of these,",00:40:06.440,00:40:11.791
"and all of that will be good
enough for my conscience.",00:40:11.791,00:40:16.518
"Let's prove the first one.
Mostly, it's an exercise in",00:40:16.518,00:40:21.245
"using the first exponential
shift rule.",00:40:21.245,00:40:24.635
"Okay, this will be a first
example actually seeing a work",00:40:24.635,00:40:29.629
"in practice as opposed to
proving it.",00:40:29.629,00:40:34.000
"Okay, so what does that thing
look like?",00:40:34.000,00:40:37.484
"So, what does the polynomial
look like, which has a as a",00:40:37.484,00:40:42.398
"simple root?
So, we're going to try to prove",00:40:42.398,00:40:46.240
"the simple root case.
So, I'm just going to calculate",00:40:46.240,00:40:50.886
"what those guys actually look
like.",00:40:50.886,00:40:53.924
"What does p of D look
like if a is a simple root?",00:40:53.924,00:41:00.000
"Well, if it's a simple root,
that means it has a factor.",00:41:00.000,00:41:04.700
"When it factors,
it factors into the product of",00:41:04.700,00:41:08.632
"(D minus a) times something
which isn't, D minus some other",00:41:08.632,00:41:13.589
"root.
And, the point is that b is not",00:41:13.589,00:41:16.666
"equal to A.
The roots are really distinct.",00:41:16.666,00:41:20.170
"Okay, what's,
then, p prime,",00:41:20.170,00:41:23.162
"I'm going to have to calculate
p prime of a.",00:41:23.162,00:41:27.692
"What is that?
Well, let's calculate p prime",00:41:27.692,00:41:32.086
"of D first.
It is, well,",00:41:32.086,00:41:34.461
"by the ordinary product rule,
it's the derivative of this",00:41:34.461,00:41:38.491
"times, which is one times (D
minus a) plus,",00:41:38.491,00:41:41.513
"that's one thing plus the same
thing on the other side,",00:41:41.513,00:41:45.399
"the derivative of this,
which is one times (D minus b).",00:41:45.399,00:41:49.285
"So, that's p prime.
And therefore,",00:41:49.285,00:41:51.660
"what's p prime of a?
It's nothing but,",00:41:51.660,00:41:55.042
"this part is zero,
and that's a minus b.",00:41:55.042,00:41:59.000
"Of course, this is not zero
because it's a simple root.",00:41:59.000,00:42:02.721
"And, that's the proof for you
if you want, that if the root is",00:42:02.721,00:42:06.924
"simple, that p prime of a
is guaranteed not to",00:42:06.924,00:42:10.715
"be zero.
And, you can see,",00:42:10.715,00:42:12.437
"it's going to be zero exactly
when b equals a,",00:42:12.437,00:42:15.539
"and that root occurs twice.
But, I'm assuming that didn't",00:42:15.539,00:42:19.398
"happen.
Okay, then all the rest we have",00:42:19.398,00:42:22.016
"to do is calculate,
do the calculation.",00:42:22.016,00:42:24.635
"So, what I want to prove now is
that with this p of D,",00:42:24.635,00:42:28.908
"what I'm trying to calculate
that p of D times that guy,",00:42:28.908,00:42:32.698
"x e to the a x,
except I'm going to",00:42:32.698,00:42:36.281
"write it as e to the a x times
x, guess why,",00:42:36.281,00:42:39.245
divided by p prime of a.,00:42:39.245,00:42:44.000
"This is my proposed particular
solution.",00:42:44.000,00:42:47.119
"So, what I have to do is
calculate it,",00:42:47.119,00:42:50.079
"and see that it turns out to
be, what do I hope it turns out",00:42:50.079,00:42:54.800
"to be?
What the right hand side of the",00:42:54.800,00:42:57.760
"equation, the input?
The input is e to the ax.",00:42:57.760,00:43:01.766
"If this is true,",00:43:01.766,00:43:03.753
"then yp, a particular solution,
indeed, nothing will be a",00:43:03.753,00:43:07.874
"particular solution.
Of course, there could be",00:43:07.874,00:43:11.186
"others, but in this game,
I only have to find one",00:43:11.186,00:43:14.718
"particular solution,
and that certainly by far is",00:43:14.718,00:43:18.251
"the simple as one you could
possibly find.",00:43:18.251,00:43:21.268
"So, I have to calculate this.
And now, you see why I did the",00:43:21.268,00:43:25.610
"exponential shift rule because
this is begging to be",00:43:25.610,00:43:29.363
"differentiated by something
simpler than hack.",00:43:29.363,00:43:34.000
"Okay, you can also see why I
violated the natural order of",00:43:34.000,00:43:38.660
"things and put the e to the ax
on the left in order",00:43:38.660,00:43:43.647
"that it pass over more easily.
So, the answer on the left-hand",00:43:43.647,00:43:48.635
"side is e to the ax times p of
(D plus a).",00:43:48.635,00:43:51.987
"Now, what is (p of D) plus a?
Write it in this form.",00:43:51.987,00:43:56.157
It's going to be a minus b.,00:43:56.157,00:44:00.000
"So, p of (D plus a)
is, change D to D plus a.",00:44:00.000,00:44:04.327
"So, the first factor is going",00:44:04.327,00:44:07.805
to be D plus a minus b.,00:44:07.805,00:44:10.587
"And, what's the second factor?
Change D to D plus a.",00:44:10.587,00:44:15.224
It turns into D.,00:44:15.224,00:44:16.925
"All this is the result of
taking that p of D,",00:44:16.925,00:44:21.021
"and changing D to D plus a.
And now, this is to be applied",00:44:21.021,00:44:25.426
"to what?
Well, e to the a x",00:44:25.426,00:44:28.285
"is already passed over.
So, what's left is x.",00:44:28.285,00:44:33.000
"And, that's to be divided by
the constant,",00:44:33.000,00:44:36.925
"p prime of a.
Now, what does this all come",00:44:36.925,00:44:41.808
"out to be?
e to the ax,",00:44:41.808,00:44:44.968
"what's D applied to x?
One, right?",00:44:44.968,00:44:48.127
"And now, what's this thing
applied to the constant one?",00:44:48.127,00:44:53.297
"Well, the D kills it,
so it has no effect.",00:44:53.297,00:44:57.223
"It makes it zero.
The rest just multiplies it by",00:44:57.223,00:45:02.947
"a minus b.
So, the answer to the top is (a",00:45:02.947,00:45:07.957
"minus b) times one.
And, the answer to the bottom",00:45:07.957,00:45:12.673
"is p prime of a,
which I showed you by just",00:45:12.673,00:45:17.782
"explicit calculation is a minus
b.",00:45:17.782,00:45:21.024
"And so the answer is,
e to the a x comes",00:45:21.024,00:45:25.936
"out right.
Now, the other one,",00:45:25.936,00:45:29.165
"the other formula comes out the
same way.",00:45:29.165,00:45:31.618
"I'll leave that as an exercise.
Also, I don't dare do it",00:45:31.618,00:45:34.992
"because it's much too close to
the problem I asked you to do",00:45:34.992,00:45:38.611
"for homework.
So, let's by way of conclusion,",00:45:38.611,00:45:41.310
"I'll do one more simple
example, okay?",00:45:41.310,00:45:43.579
"And then, you can feel you
understand something.",00:45:43.579,00:45:46.462
"I'm sort of bothered that I
haven't done any examples of",00:45:46.462,00:45:49.836
"this more complicated case.
So, I'll pick an easy version",00:45:49.836,00:45:53.271
"instead of the one that you have
in your notes,",00:45:53.271,00:45:56.092
"which is the one you have for
homework, which is even easier.",00:45:56.092,00:46:01.000
"So, this one's epsilon less
easy.",00:46:01.000,00:46:04.099
"Y double prime minus 3 y prime
plus 2 y equals e to the x.",00:46:04.099,00:46:10.106
"Okay, notice that one is a",00:46:10.106,00:46:14.465
"simple root.
The one I'm talking about is",00:46:14.465,00:46:18.340
"the a here, which is one.
One is a simple root of the",00:46:18.340,00:46:23.378
"polynomial D squared minus 3D
plus two,",00:46:23.378,00:46:28.706
"isn't it?
It's a zero.",00:46:28.706,00:46:32.000
"Put D equal one and you get 
one minus three plus ",00:46:32.000,00:46:35.596
"two equals zero.
It's a simple root because",00:46:35.596,00:46:38.108
"anybody can see that one is not
a double root because you know",00:46:38.108,00:46:41.590
"from critical damping,
if one were a double root,",00:46:41.590,00:46:44.330
"you know just what the
polynomial would look like,",00:46:44.330,00:46:47.127
"and it wouldn't look like that
at all.",00:46:47.127,00:46:49.240
"It would not look like D
squared minus 3D plus two.",00:46:49.240,00:46:52.379
It would look differently.,00:46:52.379,00:46:54.492
"Therefore, that proves that one
is a simple root.",00:46:54.492,00:46:57.232
"Okay, what's the particular
solution, therefore?",00:46:57.232,00:47:01.000
"The particular solution is x
times e to the x divided by the",00:47:01.000,00:47:06.684
"derivative, the derivative
evaluated at the point,",00:47:06.684,00:47:11.405
"so, what's p prime of D?
It is 2D minus three.",00:47:11.405,00:47:15.740
"If I evaluate it at the point,
one, it is negative one.",00:47:15.740,00:47:20.943
"So, if this is to be divided by
negative one,",00:47:20.943,00:47:25.182
"in other words,
it's minus x e to the X.",00:47:25.182,00:47:30.000
"And, if you don't believe it,
you could plug it in and check",00:47:30.000,00:47:35.708
"it out.
Okay, I'm letting you out one",00:47:35.708,00:47:39.191
"minute early.
Remember that.",00:47:39.191,00:47:41.803
"I'm trying to pay off the
accumulated debt.",00:47:41.803,00:47:44.603
