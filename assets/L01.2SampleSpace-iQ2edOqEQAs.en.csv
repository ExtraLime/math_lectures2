"Putting together a probabilistic
model--",00:00:03.300,00:00:05.900
"that is, a model of a random
phenomenon or a random",00:00:05.900,00:00:09.060
experiment--,00:00:09.060,00:00:10.300
involves two steps.,00:00:10.300,00:00:12.360
"First step, we describe the
possible outcomes of the",00:00:12.360,00:00:16.020
"phenomenon or experiment
of interest.",00:00:16.020,00:00:18.930
"Second step, we describe our
beliefs about the likelihood",00:00:18.930,00:00:22.940
"of the different possible
outcomes by specifying a",00:00:22.940,00:00:25.660
probability law.,00:00:25.660,00:00:27.570
"Here, we start by just talking
about the first step, namely,",00:00:27.570,00:00:31.650
"the description of the possible
outcomes of the",00:00:31.650,00:00:33.830
experiment.,00:00:33.830,00:00:34.950
So we carry out an experiment.,00:00:34.950,00:00:36.760
"For example, we flip a coin.",00:00:36.760,00:00:38.540
"Or maybe we flip five coins
simultaneously.",00:00:38.540,00:00:41.400
Or maybe we roll a die.,00:00:41.400,00:00:43.740
"Whatever that experiment is,
it has a number of possible",00:00:43.740,00:00:48.390
"outcomes, and we start
by making a list of",00:00:48.390,00:00:51.970
the possible outcomes--,00:00:51.970,00:00:53.830
"or, a better word, instead of
the word ""list"", is to use the",00:00:53.830,00:00:57.490
"word ""set"", which has a more
formal mathematical meaning.",00:00:57.490,00:01:01.520
"So we create a set
that we usually",00:01:01.520,00:01:05.400
denote by capital omega.,00:01:05.400,00:01:09.850
"That set is called the sample
space and is the set of all",00:01:09.850,00:01:14.570
"possible outcomes of
our experiment.",00:01:14.570,00:01:17.565
"The elements of that set
should have certain",00:01:21.289,00:01:24.750
properties.,00:01:24.750,00:01:25.980
"Namely, the elements should
be mutually exclusive and",00:01:25.980,00:01:29.590
collectively exhaustive.,00:01:29.590,00:01:31.620
What does that mean?,00:01:31.620,00:01:32.860
"Mutually exclusive means that,
if at the end of the",00:01:32.860,00:01:36.289
"experiment, I tell you that this
outcome happened, then it",00:01:36.289,00:01:41.160
"should not be possible that this
outcome also happened.",00:01:41.160,00:01:44.970
"At the end of the experiment,
there can only be one of the",00:01:44.970,00:01:47.759
outcomes that has happened.,00:01:47.759,00:01:50.200
"Being collectively exhaustive
means something else-- that,",00:01:50.200,00:01:53.420
"together, all of these elements
of the set exhaust",00:01:53.420,00:01:57.330
all the possibilities.,00:01:57.330,00:01:59.400
"So no matter what, at the end,
you will be able to point to",00:01:59.400,00:02:03.400
"one of the outcomes and say,
that's the one that occurred.",00:02:03.400,00:02:07.860
To summarize--,00:02:07.860,00:02:09.009
"this set should be such that, at
the end of the experiment,",00:02:09.009,00:02:12.340
"you should be always able to
point to one, and exactly one,",00:02:12.340,00:02:17.270
"of the possible outcomes and say
that this is the outcome",00:02:17.270,00:02:20.660
that occurred.,00:02:20.660,00:02:21.910
"Physically different outcomes
should be distinguished in the",00:02:23.700,00:02:28.870
"sample space and correspond
to distinct points.",00:02:28.870,00:02:33.530
"But when we say physically
different",00:02:33.530,00:02:35.760
"outcomes, what do we mean?",00:02:35.760,00:02:37.840
"We really mean different in
all relevant aspects but",00:02:37.840,00:02:41.910
"perhaps not different in
irrelevant aspects.",00:02:41.910,00:02:45.880
"Let's make more precise what I
mean by that by looking at a",00:02:45.880,00:02:50.180
"very simple, and maybe
silly, example,",00:02:50.180,00:02:53.600
which is the following.,00:02:53.600,00:02:54.625
"Suppose that you flip a coin
and you see whether it",00:02:54.625,00:02:58.360
resulted in heads or tails.,00:02:58.360,00:03:01.980
"So you have a perfectly
legitimate sample space for",00:03:01.980,00:03:05.890
"this experiment which consists
of just two points--",00:03:05.890,00:03:09.470
heads and tails.,00:03:09.470,00:03:11.200
"Together these two outcomes
exhaust all possibilities.",00:03:11.200,00:03:16.750
"And the two outcomes are
mutually exclusive.",00:03:16.750,00:03:19.380
"So this is a very legitimate
sample space for this",00:03:19.380,00:03:22.200
experiment.,00:03:22.200,00:03:23.760
"Now suppose that while you were
flipping the coin, you",00:03:23.760,00:03:26.620
"also looked outside the window
to check the weather.",00:03:26.620,00:03:30.110
"And then you could say that my
sample space is really, heads,",00:03:30.110,00:03:37.140
and it's raining.,00:03:37.140,00:03:38.410
"Another possible outcome
is heads and no rain.",00:03:40.970,00:03:44.965
"Another possible outcome is
tails, and it's raining, and,",00:03:48.780,00:03:55.640
"finally, another possible
outcome is tails and no rain.",00:03:55.640,00:03:59.975
"This set, consisting of four
elements, is also a perfectly",00:04:05.490,00:04:11.560
"legitimate sample space
for the experiment",00:04:11.560,00:04:14.315
of flipping a coin.,00:04:14.315,00:04:16.140
"The elements of this sample
space are mutually exclusive",00:04:16.140,00:04:19.060
and collectively exhaustive.,00:04:19.060,00:04:20.390
"Exactly one of these outcomes
is going to be true, or will",00:04:20.390,00:04:24.830
"have materialized, at the
end of the experiment.",00:04:24.830,00:04:27.640
"So which sample space
is the correct one?",00:04:27.640,00:04:30.440
"This sample space, the
second one, involves",00:04:30.440,00:04:32.950
some irrelevant details.,00:04:32.950,00:04:34.970
"So the preferred sample space
for describing the flipping of",00:04:34.970,00:04:40.090
"a coin, the preferred sample
space is the simpler one, the",00:04:40.090,00:04:44.260
"first one, which is sort of at
the right granularity, given",00:04:44.260,00:04:48.340
what we're interested in.,00:04:48.340,00:04:50.640
"But ultimately, the question
of which one is the right",00:04:50.640,00:04:54.010
"sample space depends
on what kind of",00:04:54.010,00:04:56.760
questions you want to answer.,00:04:56.760,00:04:58.840
"For example, if you have a
theory that the weather",00:04:58.840,00:05:02.280
"affects the behavior of coins,
then, in order to play with",00:05:02.280,00:05:07.020
"that theory, or maybe check it
out, and so on, then, in such",00:05:07.020,00:05:11.960
"a case, you might want to work
with the second sample space.",00:05:11.960,00:05:15.810
"This is a common feature
in all of science.",00:05:15.810,00:05:19.070
"Whenever you put together a
model, you need to decide how",00:05:19.070,00:05:22.670
"detailed you want your
model to be.",00:05:22.670,00:05:25.080
"And the right level of detail is
the one that captures those",00:05:25.080,00:05:28.870
"aspects that are relevant
and of interest to you.",00:05:28.870,00:05:32.500
