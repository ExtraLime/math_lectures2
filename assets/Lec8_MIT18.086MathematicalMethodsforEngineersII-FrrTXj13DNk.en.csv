"PROFESSOR: So, you see that --
I thought maybe we've got enough",00:00:15.460,00:00:21.760
"good examples in theory
where we need some practice.",00:00:21.760,00:00:27.740
"We need some experiments with
some of the finite difference",00:00:27.740,00:00:34.680
methods that we've spoken about.,00:00:34.680,00:00:37.320
"So I created this homework in
which you would like choose",00:00:37.320,00:00:42.160
one of these that we've done.,00:00:42.160,00:00:45.610
"Well, actually, number two,
the Schrodinger equation,",00:00:45.610,00:00:50.690
"which has that
imaginary i in there,",00:00:50.690,00:00:54.860
"we haven't spoken
about yet, but you",00:00:54.860,00:00:57.800
"could do the kind
of Fourier analysis",00:00:57.800,00:01:02.160
"that we've done for
the heat equation.",00:01:02.160,00:01:04.240
"But, of course, it's going to
be different because of that i.",00:01:04.240,00:01:09.790
"You'll get an e to the minus
i k squared t, I guess.",00:01:09.790,00:01:14.390
"And that means that's a
number of absolute value",00:01:14.390,00:01:18.610
"1 instead of a rapidly
decaying coefficient.",00:01:18.610,00:01:23.550
"OK, so my idea is to
choose one of those groups,",00:01:23.550,00:01:26.990
"or a number five, if you want.",00:01:26.990,00:01:30.300
"And say, by next
Friday, just give me",00:01:30.300,00:01:36.320
some experiment with a code.,00:01:36.320,00:01:41.300
"In this case, you
could use -- well,",00:01:43.850,00:01:47.150
"we have four methods and three
of them are already in code,",00:01:47.150,00:01:52.150
"and you're welcome to
use those or your own.",00:01:52.150,00:01:54.590
"And I raised
questions last time --",00:01:54.590,00:01:57.050
"and I'll put this on the website
with a little more detail.",00:01:57.050,00:02:01.740
"So just to give you an
idea of what's coming.",00:02:01.740,00:02:04.880
"So this is the
problem that we're",00:02:04.880,00:02:07.550
"in the middle of speaking
about, near the end,",00:02:07.550,00:02:10.890
"the mixture of
convection and diffusion.",00:02:10.890,00:02:15.560
"And this is Schrodinger,
which is new.",00:02:15.560,00:02:19.140
"This is the advection equation,
or the one-way wave equation,",00:02:19.140,00:02:23.430
"which we've started with,
and this is what's --",00:02:23.430,00:02:27.750
"this'll be the subject of
today's lecture and next time.",00:02:27.750,00:02:32.320
"And the best reference I can
give, as well as the textbook,",00:02:32.320,00:02:39.100
"the applied math book has
significant discussion",00:02:39.100,00:02:45.440
of this conservation law.,00:02:45.440,00:02:48.660
"But also it's very well
presented in the 16.920 lecture",00:02:48.660,00:02:54.320
"notes that are on
OpenCourseWare,",00:02:54.320,00:02:57.630
lectures 11 and 12.,00:02:57.630,00:02:59.070
"So I'm going to use those
as a guide in this lecture.",00:02:59.070,00:03:04.770
"Anyway, I thought I'd
just put that up as, you",00:03:04.770,00:03:14.730
"know, time to see what various
difference methods will do,",00:03:14.730,00:03:21.290
"And again, it'll
be on the website.",00:03:21.290,00:03:24.410
OK.,00:03:24.410,00:03:25.760
"Now to say another
word about this one,",00:03:25.760,00:03:30.640
"this convection-diffusion
equation.",00:03:30.640,00:03:36.120
"So, last time I wrote down a
difference equation very much",00:03:36.120,00:03:42.970
"like that except what
I wrote down last time",00:03:42.970,00:03:47.260
was upwinded so that was just j.,00:03:47.260,00:03:51.170
Now it's j minus 1.,00:03:51.170,00:03:53.970
"And the choice
there is not clear.",00:03:53.970,00:03:59.920
"This gives us higher
accuracy, of course,",00:03:59.920,00:04:04.140
"for that x difference,
because it's centered at j.",00:04:04.140,00:04:09.270
"And we still have this
centered, of course.",00:04:11.880,00:04:15.090
"The second difference
is centered.",00:04:15.090,00:04:17.740
"So I wrote down here
what the coefficients",00:04:17.740,00:04:20.890
"are of the three old values at j
plus 1, at j, and at j minus 1.",00:04:20.890,00:04:28.170
"But there is one
important point here.",00:04:28.170,00:04:32.230
"The price for that
extra accuracy",00:04:32.230,00:04:36.530
"may possibly be a
negative coefficient.",00:04:36.530,00:04:41.650
"This could be negative,
or it could be positive.",00:04:41.650,00:04:45.310
"It depends which
is more important:",00:04:45.310,00:04:47.840
"the small r, the convection
part, or the big R.",00:04:47.840,00:04:54.280
And let me follow up.,00:04:54.280,00:04:58.100
So you remember the price.,00:04:58.100,00:05:00.730
"If we see a negative
coefficient,",00:05:00.730,00:05:04.410
"then we expect some
oscillations to appear.",00:05:04.410,00:05:10.610
"And actually, they were supposed
to appear in Figure 5.12,",00:05:10.610,00:05:13.870
but it hasn't been done yet.,00:05:13.870,00:05:15.710
"And if you would choose
this one and do Figure 5.12,",00:05:15.710,00:05:19.470
I'll be incredibly grateful.,00:05:19.470,00:05:22.320
"So Figure 5.12 was to show
the evolution from a u naught",00:05:22.320,00:05:29.060
for the convection-diffusion.,00:05:29.060,00:05:32.220
"OK, so can I just -- do you see
that in comparing R with r over",00:05:32.220,00:05:38.670
"2, those are dimensionless
quantities, right?",00:05:38.670,00:05:43.970
"Can I take another
minute to try?",00:05:43.970,00:05:46.760
"I'm a total amateur at
dimensional analysis.",00:05:46.760,00:05:53.140
"I did always think, however,
that Einstein could have proved",00:05:53.140,00:05:59.043
"-- well, not maybe proved, but
could have conjectured that E",00:05:59.043,00:06:04.320
"was m c squared, the
most important equation",00:06:04.320,00:06:08.210
"in relativity, just by
checking the dimensions.",00:06:08.210,00:06:13.030
"I don't know if that
would -- I mean, right?",00:06:13.030,00:06:15.360
"That would like -- might have
occurred to him to realize that",00:06:15.360,00:06:19.410
"m c squared has the dimensions,
if we wrote those out,",00:06:19.410,00:06:22.940
of energy.,00:06:22.940,00:06:24.810
"I don't know if that put an idea
into the system which produced,",00:06:24.810,00:06:34.410
"of course, the fact
that -- and, of course,",00:06:34.410,00:06:37.910
"there would be a
dimensionless constant,",00:06:37.910,00:06:39.690
which amazingly happens to be 1.,00:06:39.690,00:06:43.000
"OK, so dimensional analysis
could, like, change the world.",00:06:43.000,00:06:47.080
"This won't quite
change the world,",00:06:47.080,00:06:48.820
but a little touch of something.,00:06:48.820,00:06:54.040
"OK, so can I just -- you
remember that this Peclet",00:06:54.040,00:06:59.750
"number, and I'll write
his name down again.",00:06:59.750,00:07:03.370
P-E-C-L-E-T. The Peclet number.,00:07:03.370,00:07:07.240
"In the differential
equation, the Peclet number",00:07:07.240,00:07:11.890
"was a ratio, essentially
a ratio, of c to d.",00:07:11.890,00:07:20.000
"But to get the -- I
think we needed --",00:07:20.000,00:07:24.650
was that what we needed?,00:07:24.650,00:07:27.440
"We needed a length to
make it dimensionless.",00:07:27.440,00:07:32.810
"c is the coefficient for -- c
over d sort of tells us roughly",00:07:32.810,00:07:37.670
"the importance of
convection and diffusion,",00:07:37.670,00:07:40.070
"but there's a length
scale to be included.",00:07:40.070,00:07:43.470
"Now the cell Peclet number,
which I'll just call P,",00:07:43.470,00:07:52.080
"I'm just going to
take to be r over R",00:07:52.080,00:07:55.427
because those are dimensionless.,00:07:55.427,00:07:56.760
"And you see that it's
going to play a part here.",00:07:59.370,00:08:04.410
"Let me see, I forgot.",00:08:04.410,00:08:06.460
"I think I want r over R. Maybe
I want a 2 just because I would",00:08:06.460,00:08:13.420
"like that to -- I'd like it
to come out simply there.",00:08:13.420,00:08:19.270
"OK, so I may put in a 2.",00:08:19.270,00:08:23.380
So that r would be 2R*p.,00:08:23.380,00:08:26.100
"Where did that 2 come
from, by the way?",00:08:26.100,00:08:28.760
"Oh, I guess it came
from there, right?",00:08:28.760,00:08:32.350
It came from that minus 1/2.,00:08:32.350,00:08:35.940
"So probably I want
a 2 there just so",00:08:35.940,00:08:38.440
"that I have a very
simple decision",00:08:38.440,00:08:41.760
"of whether this coefficient
is positive or negative, yeah.",00:08:41.760,00:08:49.170
So let me put in a 2.,00:08:49.170,00:08:52.580
"OK, so r over 2 is R*P then.",00:08:52.580,00:08:55.920
"This quantity is R times P,
so this is R minus R times P,",00:08:55.920,00:09:02.100
"or it's R, which we know
is OK, times 1 minus P.",00:09:02.100,00:09:09.220
"In other words, P smaller
than 1, that coefficient --",00:09:09.220,00:09:15.330
"all the three
coefficients are positive.",00:09:15.330,00:09:17.370
It's certainly stable.,00:09:17.370,00:09:18.770
"Not only stable,
it can't oscillate.",00:09:18.770,00:09:22.010
"We can't have -- we're taking
a combination of the three old",00:09:22.010,00:09:26.950
"values and oscillations
can't show up.",00:09:26.950,00:09:31.550
"OK, so just to
see, what is this?",00:09:31.550,00:09:34.420
"And you remember that r
is c delta t over delta x,",00:09:34.420,00:09:40.720
"and capital R is d delta
t over delta x squared.",00:09:40.720,00:09:50.730
"So just to complete this,
the delta t's cancel.",00:09:50.730,00:09:56.650
One of the delta x cancels.,00:09:56.650,00:09:58.310
The other one comes up.,00:09:58.310,00:09:59.360
"So it's c over d, and then
we have a delta x and a 2.",00:09:59.360,00:10:04.850
"So that's why it's called
the cell Peclet number,",00:10:08.780,00:10:11.300
"because it's the cell
size, or in my convention,",00:10:11.300,00:10:16.680
"half the cell size that gives
the length scale and decides",00:10:16.680,00:10:24.040
"whether P is -- so I'm
just going to write down",00:10:24.040,00:10:27.860
"the conclusion that
the figure should show.",00:10:27.860,00:10:31.680
P smaller than 1.,00:10:31.680,00:10:35.400
"That means that this
coefficient is also positive.",00:10:35.400,00:10:39.780
"So that's positive
coefficients, no oscillation.",00:10:39.780,00:10:45.380
"And I think you'll see from
the output that P bigger than 1",00:10:50.820,00:10:58.740
"produces oscillation
we don't like.",00:10:58.740,00:11:04.520
"In other words, we really
don't want P larger than 1.",00:11:04.520,00:11:07.990
"And of course you
could say, well,",00:11:11.630,00:11:15.520
"look at P. It's got
a delta x in it.",00:11:15.520,00:11:18.660
"That's not going
to be a big number.",00:11:18.660,00:11:20.740
"And the method will work fine as
delta x and delta t go to zero,",00:11:23.580,00:11:31.600
"but we're going to do
a finite calculation.",00:11:31.600,00:11:36.460
"And so we're seeing
for the first time,",00:11:36.460,00:11:39.290
"like, because we have two terms
that are not dimensionally",00:11:39.290,00:11:42.730
"identical, c and d, that in that
competition between convection",00:11:42.730,00:11:52.780
"and diffusion, the
length scale is crucial,",00:11:52.780,00:11:55.890
and the mesh size is crucial.,00:11:55.890,00:12:00.590
"So I guess the answer
is we can resolve it",00:12:00.590,00:12:04.510
"by taking delta x small
enough, and hopefully,",00:12:04.510,00:12:09.060
that's not a problem.,00:12:09.060,00:12:10.090
"But, of course, you know that
there are many physical cases",00:12:10.090,00:12:18.380
"in which the diffusion
coefficient or the viscosity",00:12:18.380,00:12:24.050
"coefficient is small,
is quite small.",00:12:24.050,00:12:28.230
"And so getting that
below 1 might be hard,",00:12:28.230,00:12:31.700
"because this d could
be a very small number.",00:12:31.700,00:12:34.200
"OK, so maybe -- can I
also mention on the --",00:12:37.090,00:12:43.740
"as something that we
haven't done here,",00:12:43.740,00:12:46.580
"was to move the second
derivative, this guy,",00:12:46.580,00:12:57.210
"to time n plus 1,
make it implicit.",00:12:57.210,00:13:03.390
"In the diffusion part,
one often does that.",00:13:03.390,00:13:07.540
"The diffusion is
the term, is the one",00:13:07.540,00:13:11.320
"that's forcing us to
take this coefficient R",00:13:11.320,00:13:19.210
"below a half, delta
t of order delta",00:13:19.210,00:13:23.160
"x squared, and the
way to avoid that is",00:13:23.160,00:13:26.630
"to move the viscosity
term, at least half of it,",00:13:26.630,00:13:31.670
up to the new time.,00:13:31.670,00:13:35.320
"OK, so that's a third method.",00:13:35.320,00:13:37.690
"So we've done upwind last
time, centered, explicit",00:13:37.690,00:13:44.820
"this time, but then
that's a third one that",00:13:44.820,00:13:48.360
has to be looked at.,00:13:48.360,00:13:50.690
"OK, so that's where we
stand on linear problems.",00:13:50.690,00:13:58.920
"I'm sort of ready to
jump into nonlinear ones,",00:14:03.410,00:14:10.310
"recognizing that -- well,
there's always more to say",00:14:10.310,00:14:13.830
about linear ones.,00:14:13.830,00:14:14.920
"What are some of the things that
we have not properly discussed?",00:14:14.920,00:14:20.900
"Boundary conditions, above all.",00:14:20.900,00:14:24.170
"Boundary conditions, and we
could do something with those,",00:14:24.170,00:14:31.920
"and the notes will say more
about boundary conditions.",00:14:31.920,00:14:37.330
"So there are several types
of boundary conditions.",00:14:37.330,00:14:39.580
"I guess I'm going to say
something about them now,",00:14:39.580,00:14:42.400
"but this'll be a board that
kind of gets covered up.",00:14:42.400,00:14:45.650
"So boundary conditions: So
what are the different types?",00:14:45.650,00:14:51.050
"Well, at a real
physical boundary,",00:14:51.050,00:14:55.220
we might have u equals 0.,00:14:55.220,00:14:58.600
"Say, in heat flow, we
might hold the boundary --",00:14:58.600,00:15:05.520
"it might be the edge of
a freezer or something --",00:15:05.520,00:15:09.340
"we might hold the temperature
at zero, or at some given value.",00:15:09.340,00:15:14.030
"We might prescribe
u at a boundary.",00:15:14.030,00:15:17.300
"Or we might prescribe
the derivative.",00:15:17.300,00:15:21.450
"And just in case we're
in several dimensions,",00:15:21.450,00:15:24.460
"I'd better write it as
the outgoing derivative.",00:15:24.460,00:15:27.380
"It could be prescribed, say, 0.",00:15:27.380,00:15:29.090
"So what are those two types
of boundary conditions called?",00:15:32.680,00:15:35.440
"One's called absorbing,
an absorbing boundary,",00:15:35.440,00:15:38.920
"and the other is an
insulated boundary",00:15:38.920,00:15:41.810
where no heat goes through.,00:15:41.810,00:15:46.450
"To maintain this, heat
probably does go through.",00:15:46.450,00:15:50.390
"If our body is warm
and we're holding it",00:15:50.390,00:15:54.450
"at zero on its boundary, then
heat is going to travel out.",00:15:54.450,00:15:59.590
"And in fact, as time
goes to infinity,",00:15:59.590,00:16:01.660
"we're going to approach
cold -- a uniformly cold.",00:16:01.660,00:16:07.910
"Here, heat's not
allowed to travel out,",00:16:07.910,00:16:10.420
"so what will happen
as time goes on",00:16:10.420,00:16:12.880
is it will approach a constant.,00:16:12.880,00:16:19.590
"The temperature will approach a
constant because it can't leave",00:16:19.590,00:16:23.800
and it diffuses.,00:16:23.800,00:16:25.570
"And now I wanted to
mention a third type",00:16:25.570,00:16:33.160
"of boundary, which is a
purely computational boundary.",00:16:33.160,00:16:38.420
"We talked last time
about Maxwell's equations",00:16:38.420,00:16:42.730
"in free space, and
the big application",00:16:42.730,00:16:45.570
"of Maxwell's equations, or one
of the big ones historically,",00:16:45.570,00:16:49.120
"has been to, like, the
exterior of an airplane,",00:16:49.120,00:16:53.860
"to radar, or other
electromagnetic signals.",00:16:53.860,00:16:58.290
"So what do we do if we
have an exterior problem?",00:16:58.290,00:17:01.690
"See, here, I was always thinking
about an interior problem.",00:17:01.690,00:17:04.940
"You know, we're inside
0 to L or something.",00:17:04.940,00:17:09.300
"But now, what do we do if
a region is the outside,",00:17:09.300,00:17:15.320
it's free space all the way?,00:17:15.320,00:17:17.330
"Well, we have to create a
computational box of some sort.",00:17:17.330,00:17:22.980
"So we create a box
in which we compute,",00:17:22.980,00:17:28.510
"but the boundaries of this
box, the x-boundaries of it,",00:17:28.510,00:17:32.960
are purely artificial.,00:17:32.960,00:17:35.910
"They're just because we
can't compute to infinity.",00:17:35.910,00:17:39.960
"So waves travel in this box,
and they travel to the --",00:17:39.960,00:17:46.630
so you see what I mean?,00:17:46.630,00:17:49.250
"We're solving it in all this
space, except that's too much,",00:17:49.250,00:17:52.450
"so that's meant to be a very
large box, not a small one,",00:17:52.450,00:17:57.800
as large as we can afford.,00:17:57.800,00:18:00.690
"But waves are still going to
hit the boundary of that box.",00:18:00.690,00:18:06.780
"OK, what do we choose as
boundary condition there?",00:18:06.780,00:18:09.480
"We don't want it to reflect
back because it's not",00:18:12.260,00:18:16.650
a real boundary.,00:18:16.650,00:18:18.160
"So we have to create -- I'll
put ABC for absorbing boundary",00:18:18.160,00:18:24.650
condition.,00:18:24.650,00:18:25.710
Absorbing.,00:18:25.710,00:18:28.090
"That A is for an absorbing
boundary condition.",00:18:28.090,00:18:31.240
"And the creation of
these boundary conditions",00:18:36.700,00:18:39.670
"is an important topic
within finite differences.",00:18:39.670,00:18:44.310
"For Maxwell's
equations, a good idea",00:18:44.310,00:18:50.350
"was produced and
keeps being developed,",00:18:50.350,00:18:54.370
called perfectly matched layer.,00:18:54.370,00:18:57.050
"The idea in that
perfectly matched layer --",00:18:57.050,00:18:59.720
"let me just write PML -- and
I haven't seen this so much",00:18:59.720,00:19:06.100
in other application areas.,00:19:06.100,00:19:10.150
"The idea of this
perfectly matched layer",00:19:10.150,00:19:12.630
"is to create an artificial
dielectric, I guess,",00:19:12.630,00:19:19.020
"a dielectric medium it would
be, in the electromagnetic case.",00:19:19.020,00:19:23.520
"An artificial thin layer, which
has just the right properties",00:19:23.520,00:19:31.840
to stop the wave and swallow it.,00:19:31.840,00:19:36.240
"OK, I'll put on the
website references to that.",00:19:36.240,00:19:44.140
"It's a bright idea,
but not totally simple,",00:19:44.140,00:19:52.530
"and when we change difference
methods, then that perfectly",00:19:52.530,00:19:56.710
matched layer has to go with it.,00:19:56.710,00:19:58.250
"OK, that's the
end of my thoughts",00:19:58.250,00:20:02.640
about linear problems for now.,00:20:02.640,00:20:07.060
"We're coming back, of course,
in a few weeks to solving",00:20:07.060,00:20:14.020
"large systems, large linear
systems, the kind that we would",00:20:14.020,00:20:19.270
"meet if we use an
implicit method,",00:20:19.270,00:20:22.820
"or the kind that
we meet if we're",00:20:22.820,00:20:24.310
solving a steady-state problem.,00:20:24.310,00:20:26.050
"But for now, let me go
to that model equation.",00:20:26.050,00:20:33.660
"And you see, right
away, the difference",00:20:36.640,00:20:38.780
"between that equation and
the advection equation that",00:20:38.780,00:20:45.060
had a constant velocity.,00:20:45.060,00:20:47.700
"Here we have of a velocity that
-- so c is minus u, I guess.",00:20:47.700,00:20:56.360
"c is minus -- think of c -- this
u as being comparable to minus",00:20:56.360,00:21:01.330
c.,00:21:01.330,00:21:03.340
"So, in other words,
if u is positive,",00:21:03.340,00:21:06.340
"I'm now going to have
waves going to the right.",00:21:06.340,00:21:10.060
"So let me just put this
down. u greater than 0",00:21:12.680,00:21:16.600
"will mean waves going to
increasing x, to the right.",00:21:16.600,00:21:24.830
"And the idea will be -- so we
have to discuss that problem.",00:21:24.830,00:21:32.280
"And as always, we would like
to solve it analytically.",00:21:32.280,00:21:37.320
"Find whatever formulas we can,
understand what's happening",00:21:37.320,00:21:42.500
"in terms of these
characteristic lines, because --",00:21:42.500,00:21:47.080
"when we have one equation
and one space variable,",00:21:47.080,00:21:52.520
"we really can catch the
essence of the solution",00:21:52.520,00:21:59.000
"by understanding the
characteristic lines.",00:21:59.000,00:22:03.400
"And then how do we
do it numerically?",00:22:03.400,00:22:07.760
"OK, before class, I wrote just
a few equivalent forms of it.",00:22:07.760,00:22:14.850
"This is an equivalent form,
and this is, so to speak,",00:22:14.850,00:22:17.470
the right form.,00:22:17.470,00:22:18.280
"This is the form where we
see a time derivative of u,",00:22:22.420,00:22:27.780
"as always, and we see a space
derivative of u squared over 2,",00:22:27.780,00:22:33.590
"which, of course, produces that.",00:22:33.590,00:22:35.800
"But somehow this is the quantity
-- it's called the flux --",00:22:35.800,00:22:41.780
"that's physically
meaningful, f of u.",00:22:41.780,00:22:47.180
"So I've chosen a simple flux
function, u squared over 2.",00:22:47.180,00:22:51.400
"So that's the
differential equation.",00:22:57.490,00:23:00.270
"But you'll see that the
differential equation can",00:23:00.270,00:23:08.580
"produce two solutions
at the same point,",00:23:08.580,00:23:13.170
and we have to choose.,00:23:13.170,00:23:16.670
"In other words,
the differential --",00:23:16.670,00:23:18.810
"the solution can
become discontinuous.",00:23:18.810,00:23:21.220
"A perfectly smooth starting
function, after a while --",00:23:21.220,00:23:29.350
"this is the essence
of the problem now.",00:23:29.350,00:23:33.760
"I might have a smooth starting
function, at least continuous.",00:23:33.760,00:23:37.670
"The solution is constant
along characteristic lines.",00:23:40.460,00:23:46.050
"But what happens if two
characteristic lines",00:23:46.050,00:23:49.310
run into each other?,00:23:49.310,00:23:50.830
"I've drawn that
possibility here.",00:23:50.830,00:23:52.750
"And it'll take a little time to
see exactly what's happening,",00:23:55.510,00:24:02.020
"but the characteristics
we can see here.",00:24:02.020,00:24:04.570
"So the starting values
were 1 up to that point.",00:24:04.570,00:24:07.660
"So when the starting
value is 1 and u",00:24:10.770,00:24:16.810
"is constant along characteristic
lines, then u is 1,",00:24:16.810,00:24:22.380
"and those lines, it's just
like having c equal to minus 1,",00:24:22.380,00:24:27.540
"I guess, in the
one-way wave equation.",00:24:27.540,00:24:30.720
"We have a one-way wave
going to the right",00:24:30.720,00:24:32.920
now along characteristic lines.,00:24:32.920,00:24:36.160
"So u is 1 in this part
of the xt-plane, right?",00:24:36.160,00:24:47.990
"We have to come
back to the formulas",00:24:47.990,00:24:49.960
to confirm what I just said.,00:24:49.960,00:24:53.990
"And then, over here on the far
right, the starting value is 0,",00:24:53.990,00:25:02.670
"and the characteristics
in that case,",00:25:02.670,00:25:09.680
"the c associated with that
is 0, so it's a standing --",00:25:09.680,00:25:15.240
it's not moving.,00:25:15.240,00:25:16.300
"The characteristics
are just straight lines",00:25:16.300,00:25:20.084
in the time direction.,00:25:20.084,00:25:21.000
"Nothing's happening, right?",00:25:21.000,00:25:22.180
"When you think of a
characteristic that's",00:25:22.180,00:25:25.650
"going straight up, it's
just carrying the value of u",00:25:25.650,00:25:30.410
"without moving left or
right, so u stays 0.",00:25:30.410,00:25:34.490
"So u will be 1 here,
u will be 0 here,",00:25:34.490,00:25:38.280
"and now something's
happening in here,",00:25:38.280,00:25:41.240
"and we have to figure
out what it is.",00:25:41.240,00:25:45.740
"But maybe I can anticipate the
main point before any algebra.",00:25:45.740,00:25:50.740
"The characteristic
lines in this region",00:25:50.740,00:25:55.350
"have a slope somewhere between
the slope 1 and the slope 0.",00:25:55.350,00:26:01.450
"You see, we're starting
-- let me graph u_0 of x.",00:26:01.450,00:26:05.740
"So let me graph. u_0 of x is
-- the key points are 0 and 1,",00:26:05.740,00:26:19.500
0 and 1.,00:26:19.500,00:26:20.930
"So u_0 of x, I start with a
constant initial function,",00:26:20.930,00:26:33.500
"a constant profile to the left
of 0, and a constant profile",00:26:33.500,00:26:37.750
"to the right of 1,
and linear between.",00:26:37.750,00:26:43.100
"OK, so it's that starting
values that I wrote here:",00:26:43.100,00:26:46.990
"1, 1 minus x, and 0
are these three pieces.",00:26:46.990,00:26:52.040
"And then here I'm
in the xt-plane",00:26:52.040,00:26:54.790
where here I'm in the xu-plane.,00:26:54.790,00:26:59.390
"So I drew characteristics,
and we still have to track --",00:26:59.390,00:27:04.910
"we have to say more
what characteristics are",00:27:04.910,00:27:07.560
"and understand that these
have slopes in between,",00:27:07.560,00:27:11.210
"but you're not surprised because
the values of u are in between",00:27:11.210,00:27:15.270
1 and 0.,00:27:15.270,00:27:16.630
"So they go that way
and they meet here.",00:27:16.630,00:27:22.160
"So up to time t equal
1, characteristics",00:27:22.160,00:27:24.670
tell everything.,00:27:24.670,00:27:26.250
"Up to t equal 1,
I know that u will",00:27:26.250,00:27:29.370
"be 1 along these
characteristics,",00:27:29.370,00:27:30.946
"and when I find these
characteristics,",00:27:30.946,00:27:33.730
u is whatever it starts at.,00:27:33.730,00:27:37.030
"And u is 0 up all of
these characteristics,",00:27:37.030,00:27:39.870
"so up to that time,
the algebra --",00:27:39.870,00:27:44.850
"the differential equation
is going to be totally OK.",00:27:44.850,00:27:48.880
"But after that time, the
differential equation",00:27:51.580,00:27:54.830
is in difficulty.,00:27:54.830,00:27:58.380
"Because at that moment t -- so
what's happening as t increases",00:27:58.380,00:28:05.130
from 0 to 1?,00:28:05.130,00:28:07.280
"This is the picture
at t equals 0.",00:28:07.280,00:28:10.430
"The picture at t equal to 1
-- t equal to half, let's say.",00:28:10.430,00:28:14.900
"What would be the picture
at t equal to half?",00:28:14.900,00:28:17.030
"Well, at t equal to
half, this state 1,",00:28:17.030,00:28:21.380
"has penetrated
this far, halfway.",00:28:21.380,00:28:28.940
"Then, in here is this
converging characteristic that",00:28:28.940,00:28:34.190
come from a linear profile.,00:28:34.190,00:28:38.150
"And over here, it's all zeros.",00:28:38.150,00:28:40.870
"So that zero is still there,
but -- you see what's happening?",00:28:40.870,00:28:44.180
"This guy is -- the
profile is steepening.",00:28:44.180,00:28:50.210
This is at t equal to half.,00:28:50.210,00:28:51.620
Steeper.,00:28:55.341,00:28:55.840
"We still have the
algebra to do, but I",00:29:01.050,00:29:02.950
"think the first thing is to
see roughly what's happening.",00:29:02.950,00:29:08.360
"Then at t equal to 1,
this is totally steep.",00:29:08.360,00:29:14.030
"So this is the situation
at t equal to 1.",00:29:14.030,00:29:19.470
"And I could've given you that
as the initial condition,",00:29:19.470,00:29:24.650
"but I and the 16.920
notes, thought, OK,",00:29:24.650,00:29:30.360
"let's have a little
peace for awhile,",00:29:30.360,00:29:33.090
"see what those
characteristics are doing when",00:29:33.090,00:29:37.360
"they're converging, but
they're not crossing.",00:29:37.360,00:29:43.010
"The trouble is, after t equal
to 1, they are crossing.",00:29:43.010,00:29:48.460
"And now, what's the solution
in this crosshatched region?",00:29:48.460,00:29:57.950
"Do I take the value
of 0 that's coming up",00:29:57.950,00:30:01.820
along these characteristics?,00:30:01.820,00:30:03.700
"Do I take the value
1 that's coming",00:30:03.700,00:30:05.730
along these characteristics?,00:30:05.730,00:30:07.520
What's happening in here?,00:30:07.520,00:30:10.270
"So there's a crosshatched
region there,",00:30:10.270,00:30:13.360
"which is a big question
mark because my rule",00:30:13.360,00:30:21.850
"of following characteristics
has led me to two answers.",00:30:21.850,00:30:24.640
"And we want a physically
relevant answer.",00:30:28.720,00:30:39.030
"We're sort of
expecting, and we'll",00:30:39.030,00:30:41.660
"see, that this step
function is a step function.",00:30:41.660,00:30:51.840
"I mean, the answer will
be a step function.",00:30:51.840,00:30:55.190
"It will be 1 and then
drop to 0 along some path",00:30:55.190,00:31:03.220
"in the xt-plane, which
is not a characteristic.",00:31:03.220,00:31:07.150
"The characteristics are going
at 45 degrees and at 90 degrees.",00:31:07.150,00:31:13.600
"And actually, so this is the
region I'm interested in.",00:31:13.600,00:31:18.520
So can I blow up that region?,00:31:18.520,00:31:20.750
"So if I blow up that region,
that's where the shocks --",00:31:20.750,00:31:26.010
"the shocks are meeting
everywhere in this region.",00:31:26.010,00:31:30.620
"This was the point --
what was that point?",00:31:30.620,00:31:33.010
"I guess that was the point
x equals 0 and t equal to 1,",00:31:33.010,00:31:38.650
there.,00:31:38.650,00:31:39.690
"OK, and the question is -- and
I know that I have u equals 0",00:31:39.690,00:31:44.450
"over here, and I know --
oops, u equal 1 over here,",00:31:44.450,00:31:48.210
"and I know that I
have u equal 0 here,",00:31:48.210,00:31:50.070
"but the question is
where, and -- well,",00:31:50.070,00:31:54.600
what happens in between?,00:31:54.600,00:31:55.650
"You can think of at least
two possible scenarios,",00:31:59.630,00:32:07.920
"and one of those is that
there's a shock line that goes,",00:32:07.920,00:32:15.450
"let's say, somewhere
in the middle.",00:32:15.450,00:32:18.610
"And so u stays 1 all
the way to that line",00:32:18.610,00:32:23.390
and drops to 0 after it.,00:32:23.390,00:32:25.290
"In other words, this wall of
water travels to the right.",00:32:25.290,00:32:35.240
"The shock, the
discontinuity, moves along,",00:32:35.240,00:32:41.120
"not necessarily at the
speed that this one --",00:32:41.120,00:32:44.920
"this would be moving along the
speed of 1, with this pushing.",00:32:44.920,00:32:50.180
"Not stationary either, which
is what this right side would",00:32:50.180,00:32:53.410
"like, but somewhere between.",00:32:53.410,00:32:55.440
So that's a shock line.,00:32:55.440,00:32:57.650
"I'll just, for short,
call it a shock.",00:32:57.650,00:32:59.880
"Then there's
another possibility.",00:33:05.140,00:33:06.870
"And that will happen
in this case, actually.",00:33:06.870,00:33:09.680
That will happen in this case.,00:33:09.680,00:33:12.540
"But there is another
possibility that",00:33:12.540,00:33:14.980
"will happen in other
cases, and that would",00:33:14.980,00:33:18.860
be a fan of characteristics.,00:33:18.860,00:33:26.170
"Let me see that when it comes,
but I'm just mentioning it",00:33:26.170,00:33:30.310
"to say that this business
of the shock line,",00:33:30.310,00:33:33.540
"which is what we'll
pursue now, which --",00:33:33.540,00:33:35.990
"because it's what happens
with this problem --",00:33:35.990,00:33:39.540
"is not the only -- is not
always the way to match,",00:33:39.540,00:33:47.240
"the way to deal with a problem
of lack of information coming",00:33:47.240,00:33:55.350
from the characteristics.,00:33:55.350,00:33:56.610
"OK, so I guess our question
is, what is that shock line?",00:33:56.610,00:34:05.870
What's the path?,00:34:05.870,00:34:06.730
"What's the slope,
and what controls it?",00:34:06.730,00:34:13.500
"And the answer will be
that what controls --",00:34:13.500,00:34:16.720
"we run into problems with
the differential equations.",00:34:16.720,00:34:21.140
"And the way to see what
continues to happen",00:34:21.140,00:34:28.430
"is to go to the integrated
form, the integral form",00:34:28.430,00:34:31.900
"of the equation, where, of
course, by taking an integral,",00:34:31.900,00:34:37.470
"I make everything
smoother, and also I",00:34:37.470,00:34:41.220
"preserve the physical
law, the conservation law.",00:34:41.220,00:34:45.770
"So this is really
the conservation law.",00:34:45.770,00:34:48.360
What is this?,00:34:52.250,00:34:53.330
"Well, let's first of all
see where it comes from.",00:34:53.330,00:34:55.620
"It just comes from integrating
this equation with respect",00:34:55.620,00:35:02.970
to x.,00:35:02.970,00:35:04.210
"So I have a time derivative
that I keep out here,",00:35:04.210,00:35:07.980
"but my space derivative is
going to disappear because I'm",00:35:07.980,00:35:10.780
integrating with respect to x.,00:35:10.780,00:35:12.240
"So I can call d by dt or partial
d by dt the integral of u with",00:35:12.240,00:35:18.075
"respect to x, and I'm
integrating from somewhere --",00:35:18.075,00:35:21.310
"from some point to
some other point.",00:35:21.310,00:35:24.040
"Instead of a and b, I'll call
them -- I really should --",00:35:24.040,00:35:28.440
"I'm sorry, I should say x on
the left and x on the right.",00:35:28.440,00:35:33.740
"Some point x at the left and
some point x at the right.",00:35:33.740,00:35:40.800
"And now I've
integrated this one.",00:35:40.800,00:35:43.370
"I've called -- this is f of u
so I'm now thinking of any flux",00:35:43.370,00:35:50.870
function.,00:35:50.870,00:35:52.520
"And the integral,
of course, gives me",00:35:52.520,00:35:54.870
"f of u at the upper end minus
f of u at the lower end.",00:35:54.870,00:35:59.130
"OK, so that's the
conservation law.",00:35:59.130,00:36:01.880
Let me write that word down.,00:36:01.880,00:36:03.900
This is the conservation law.,00:36:03.900,00:36:06.310
What is it saying?,00:36:06.310,00:36:07.300
"It's saying that the change in
the quantity in the integral is",00:36:12.970,00:36:20.630
"given by -- if there's any
change, any time derivative,",00:36:20.630,00:36:24.820
"the rate of change
in the interval --",00:36:24.820,00:36:28.710
"it's the conservation
of this integral,",00:36:28.710,00:36:33.950
"meaning that any change in that
integral happens because there",00:36:33.950,00:36:42.480
"is flow going out the
right-hand side of the interval",00:36:42.480,00:36:46.990
"or there's flow coming in the
left side of the interval.",00:36:46.990,00:36:50.220
"So that's why we have a
minus sign between them.",00:36:50.220,00:36:53.990
"So that's a statement of
conservation, and -- oh,",00:36:53.990,00:37:02.550
"there's one more example
that I'll mention now.",00:37:02.550,00:37:07.350
"Let me give this
particular equation a name,",00:37:07.350,00:37:10.840
just because you see it.,00:37:10.840,00:37:12.040
"You often see it written --
called Burger's equation.",00:37:12.040,00:37:16.130
"But actually, the full name
is the inviscid, no viscosity,",00:37:22.550,00:37:32.650
"Burgers' equation
because it's a 0.",00:37:32.650,00:37:34.550
"So just one word about
Burger's equation.",00:37:37.370,00:37:41.280
"So Burger allowed
a u_xx term here.",00:37:41.280,00:37:47.090
"So he had one of our
-- nonlinear convection",00:37:47.090,00:37:52.150
"and a diffusion term, and his
convection was this simple",00:37:52.150,00:37:59.710
expression u*u_x.,00:37:59.710,00:38:02.590
"It's the kind of thing you see
in the Navier-Stokes equations,",00:38:02.590,00:38:05.450
right?,00:38:05.450,00:38:06.000
"The nonlinearity
in Navier-Stokes",00:38:06.000,00:38:08.430
"is sort of in this term,
of this general sort,",00:38:08.430,00:38:11.760
"but this is a major
simplification.",00:38:11.760,00:38:15.330
"Such a simplification
that Burger could solve,",00:38:15.330,00:38:19.545
"even though the
equation was nonlinear.",00:38:19.545,00:38:21.170
"Well, two people,
at the same time,",00:38:24.480,00:38:26.140
"discovered the
change of variable,",00:38:26.140,00:38:30.240
a simple little trick.,00:38:30.240,00:38:32.730
Hopf and Cole.,00:38:32.730,00:38:34.420
"I'll put their names
down because they",00:38:34.420,00:38:38.430
"had nice, short last names.",00:38:38.430,00:38:41.520
"They both discovered -- in
the case of a diffusion term,",00:38:41.520,00:38:46.370
"they both discovered a little --
a change of variables that made",00:38:46.370,00:38:49.660
the equation linear.,00:38:49.660,00:38:51.130
"Then they could
solve the equation.",00:38:51.130,00:38:52.870
"That's in the textbook in the
section on conservation laws.",00:38:52.870,00:38:58.440
"And then the important
thing that Burger could do",00:38:58.440,00:39:02.660
"was let the diffusion
coefficient go to zero.",00:39:02.660,00:39:07.380
"So then in the limit, he got
the inviscid Burger's equation,",00:39:07.380,00:39:11.050
the one we're looking at.,00:39:11.050,00:39:12.950
"And he could look
at the solution",00:39:12.950,00:39:14.950
and let the limit go to zero.,00:39:14.950,00:39:16.480
"And that's another way to figure
out what's the right solution.",00:39:16.480,00:39:24.580
"That's the viscosity method,
a fundamental method,",00:39:24.580,00:39:28.900
"for finding out when we
run into a problem, shocks",00:39:28.900,00:39:34.340
run into each other.,00:39:34.340,00:39:35.350
We don't know what to choose.,00:39:35.350,00:39:39.940
"One way to find out,
in this 1D problem",00:39:39.940,00:39:44.830
"and also in much tougher
nonlinear multidimensional",00:39:44.830,00:39:50.300
"problems, is put a
little viscosity in,",00:39:50.300,00:39:54.990
and let it be small.,00:39:54.990,00:39:57.230
Let it even get smaller.,00:39:57.230,00:39:59.650
"Then -- with a little viscosity,
officially this term --",00:39:59.650,00:40:07.030
"in some sense, this term,
because it's a second",00:40:07.030,00:40:13.150
"derivative, is officially,
mathematically speaking,",00:40:13.150,00:40:17.440
"sort of dominates this
one as far as -- I mean,",00:40:17.440,00:40:25.150
"this will produce
a smooth solution.",00:40:25.150,00:40:27.320
"This term, as we know
doesn't smooth the solution.",00:40:30.420,00:40:33.610
"It just advects it,
just carries it along.",00:40:33.610,00:40:37.270
But this term will smooth it.,00:40:37.270,00:40:39.780
"So this is the dominant
term, the second derivative.",00:40:39.780,00:40:44.880
No surprise.,00:40:44.880,00:40:45.790
"So when we introduce that,
that smooths everything.",00:40:50.060,00:40:53.880
"We have no problem to say
there is a solution, at least",00:40:53.880,00:40:59.380
"for simpler models,
and then we can",00:40:59.380,00:41:05.890
"see what happens when
that term approaches zero.",00:41:05.890,00:41:09.740
"OK, so that's another method.",00:41:09.740,00:41:11.340
"And, of course, that's
kind of what we're",00:41:11.340,00:41:13.540
doing with finite differences.,00:41:13.540,00:41:15.710
"Finite differences, if we
put in a little viscosity,",00:41:15.710,00:41:20.120
"a little second-space
difference,",00:41:20.120,00:41:23.500
"and take delta t small
enough for stability,",00:41:23.500,00:41:26.730
then we can solve it.,00:41:26.730,00:41:29.140
"And if we take it very small,
we should get something close",00:41:29.140,00:41:35.970
to the inviscid limit.,00:41:35.970,00:41:37.660
"OK, I was just
giving Burger's name",00:41:37.660,00:41:42.070
to that particular example.,00:41:42.070,00:41:44.970
"So this isn't the only example,
but it's the simplest example.",00:41:44.970,00:41:49.210
"OK, another example
of conservation laws",00:41:49.210,00:41:55.010
"that everybody likes, I
think, is the traffic flow,",00:41:55.010,00:42:00.640
"traffic flow in one
direction, say, on the Mass.",00:42:00.640,00:42:03.000
Pike.,00:42:03.000,00:42:04.250
"So what's the equation
of traffic flow?",00:42:04.250,00:42:07.470
"Let me put that on a
board here, and then I",00:42:07.470,00:42:11.250
have to come back to this.,00:42:11.250,00:42:14.300
"Well, I'll put it here.",00:42:14.300,00:42:17.370
"So Example 2 -- well, I don't
know if you can call that",00:42:17.370,00:42:21.060
Example 1.,00:42:21.060,00:42:21.810
"We didn't give it
a physical meaning.",00:42:21.810,00:42:24.150
"Example 2 will be traffic flow
in 1D, and what's the unknown?",00:42:24.150,00:42:35.080
"Well, it's the thing
I've been calling u,",00:42:38.960,00:42:43.790
"but for traffic flow,
the natural unknown",00:42:43.790,00:42:48.200
"is the density of the traffic,
the density of the cars.",00:42:48.200,00:42:51.430
"And everybody uses
rho for density.",00:42:58.300,00:43:02.100
So can I use rho rather than u?,00:43:02.100,00:43:04.510
"And then, in the
equation will be a car --",00:43:07.850,00:43:16.580
"a velocity that I'll call
v. That's not a new unknown.",00:43:16.580,00:43:23.470
"In fact, the velocity
experimentally depends -- oh,",00:43:26.600,00:43:31.860
there's a relation.,00:43:31.860,00:43:34.230
"The density and velocity
are, by experiments,",00:43:34.230,00:43:39.610
"if you run an
experiment on the Mass.",00:43:39.610,00:43:41.430
"Pike in heavy traffic -- that
could be a homework problem,",00:43:41.430,00:43:45.500
"too -- to find the
relation between v and rho.",00:43:45.500,00:43:52.390
"So I'm going to keep
this rho as the unknown",00:43:52.390,00:43:55.660
"and imagine that we have some
experimental velocity v of rho.",00:43:55.660,00:44:02.970
And what would we expect?,00:44:02.970,00:44:05.390
"I guess we expect that
as rho increases --",00:44:05.390,00:44:12.890
"as the density increases,
what will happen?",00:44:12.890,00:44:16.600
"As the density increases, the
traffic is going to slow down,",00:44:16.600,00:44:20.680
"ultimately come to a stop, where
if the density is very small,",00:44:20.680,00:44:26.830
"so the density 0 -- I mean,
we just have a single driver,",00:44:26.830,00:44:33.370
"the police are not out, so
he's going v_max or 2*v_max.",00:44:33.370,00:44:40.020
"But as the road gets
crowded, the velocity",00:44:43.180,00:44:51.950
drops and maybe drops linearly.,00:44:51.950,00:44:53.830
"That would be a possible
and not that terrible",00:44:57.650,00:45:06.990
relation between v and rho.,00:45:06.990,00:45:09.440
"So what would be the flux
function in this traffic flow",00:45:09.440,00:45:12.421
problem?,00:45:12.421,00:45:12.920
"The conservation law is like
conservation of cars, right?",00:45:15.500,00:45:20.200
"If we look at a unit, a
piece of the turnpike, then",00:45:20.200,00:45:30.730
"the conservation law says
that the total number",00:45:30.730,00:45:33.590
"of cars inside, which is
this, changes by cars leaving",00:45:33.590,00:45:43.060
and by cars entering.,00:45:43.060,00:45:47.280
"And so the flux function
I think will be --",00:45:47.280,00:45:50.480
"so we have to know like sort
of how many cars are leaving,",00:45:50.480,00:45:56.450
"and I think the flux function
would be probably v times rho.",00:45:56.450,00:46:01.970
"I think the flux function of
-- rho, now, is my unknown --",00:46:01.970,00:46:09.200
"I think would be v
of rho times rho,",00:46:09.200,00:46:13.620
the velocity times the density.,00:46:13.620,00:46:15.370
"That tells me how many
cars are going out.",00:46:15.370,00:46:18.400
"OK, so I guess what I want to
say is that we will meet --",00:46:18.400,00:46:25.080
"that we meet, in this
traffic flow example,",00:46:25.080,00:46:28.200
"exactly these
possibilities that --",00:46:28.200,00:46:35.040
"we meet them mathematically just
the way we meet them in actual",00:46:35.040,00:46:38.020
driving -- of a shock.,00:46:38.020,00:46:45.190
"So this shock corresponds
to -- so what that's?",00:46:45.190,00:46:50.020
"Like stop-go -- this
corresponds to, I suppose,",00:46:50.020,00:46:56.940
like meeting a red light?,00:46:56.940,00:46:58.200
"Coming up to a red light, the
traffic you're behind normally",00:47:01.350,00:47:06.470
stops.,00:47:06.470,00:47:07.420
"It has to slow
way down and stop.",00:47:07.420,00:47:12.290
Then the light turns green.,00:47:12.290,00:47:16.000
The first car takes off.,00:47:16.000,00:47:18.690
The cars begin to spread out.,00:47:18.690,00:47:21.600
"That's the solution
that I don't see",00:47:21.600,00:47:30.410
"with this starting function,
a sort of fan of cars.",00:47:30.410,00:47:35.330
"So maybe I could write those
words down: shock or a fan.",00:47:35.330,00:47:40.240
"The shock is what happens when
characteristics come together,",00:47:44.620,00:47:49.090
cars come together.,00:47:49.090,00:47:51.110
"The fan is when the
characteristics fan out.",00:47:51.110,00:47:56.840
"Actually, I could illustrate
a fan here right away.",00:47:56.840,00:48:02.140
"Suppose I reverse 0 and
1 just to see what -- OK,",00:48:02.140,00:48:11.650
"so here's my --
this is my x again.",00:48:11.650,00:48:17.460
"So here I'm going to have u_0
to be 0 now, u_0 to be -- well,",00:48:17.460,00:48:26.730
"I can even -- it's called a
Riemann problem when there are",00:48:26.730,00:48:30.520
just two values here.,00:48:30.520,00:48:32.620
u_0 is 1.,00:48:32.620,00:48:34.230
"So the so-called Riemann
problem is the cleanest example",00:48:34.230,00:48:41.660
"of the whole
conservation law theory",00:48:41.660,00:48:45.760
"when there are just two starting
values, 0 and 1, or 1 and 0.",00:48:45.760,00:48:50.340
And it makes a big difference.,00:48:50.340,00:48:52.170
"1 and 0, we saw when we reached
time 1, we had a 1 and a 0,",00:48:52.170,00:48:57.740
"and after that, a shock formed.",00:48:57.740,00:49:00.100
"Here 0 and 1, the
characteristics",00:49:00.100,00:49:02.870
here are going as always.,00:49:02.870,00:49:05.840
So u is 1 here.,00:49:05.840,00:49:07.230
"The characteristics here,
this is staying at 0.",00:49:07.230,00:49:12.670
There's no reason to change.,00:49:12.670,00:49:14.920
"But here we have now a region,
just like the other one,",00:49:14.920,00:49:22.920
but with a major difference.,00:49:22.920,00:49:24.870
"That now, it's 0
on the left and 1",00:49:24.870,00:49:27.580
"on the right, where before,
it was 1 on the left",00:49:27.580,00:49:30.500
and 0 on the right.,00:49:30.500,00:49:32.220
"And the question is,
what happens in here?",00:49:32.220,00:49:35.300
"Well, you might think
a shock, a step up",00:49:35.300,00:49:41.180
from 0 to 1 at some point.,00:49:41.180,00:49:43.780
"And I would have to agree that
you could do that in such a way",00:49:43.780,00:49:51.540
"that you maintained
the conservation law.",00:49:51.540,00:49:55.160
But that's not what happens.,00:49:58.540,00:50:01.860
"This is going to
be a fan in here.",00:50:01.860,00:50:04.470
"We're going to have -- what
we'll have is characteristics",00:50:08.100,00:50:10.940
in here.,00:50:10.940,00:50:11.790
"This will -- let me
draw the profile.",00:50:11.790,00:50:14.300
"So the profile is 0
there to 0 at some time.",00:50:14.300,00:50:21.000
"Then over here, where this
characteristic is met, it's 1,",00:50:21.000,00:50:26.580
"and this is what
happens: Instead",00:50:26.580,00:50:34.310
"of getting worse, less
smooth, the solution",00:50:34.310,00:50:37.680
"gets better, more smooth, when
the direction is reversed.",00:50:37.680,00:50:41.930
"So we see that our problem
had to be nonlinear.",00:50:41.930,00:50:45.220
"A linear problem couldn't
do these two opposite things",00:50:45.220,00:50:50.010
in the same thing.,00:50:50.010,00:50:53.110
"So here we would have a fan and
the characteristics go there,",00:50:53.110,00:50:57.630
and it's reflected there.,00:50:57.630,00:50:59.730
"OK, so there's a picture of the
phenomena that we're looking at",00:50:59.730,00:51:04.660
"and we would like to
see numerically, too.",00:51:04.660,00:51:09.590
"So next time I want to find --
so I can say now what I have",00:51:09.590,00:51:16.720
to do next time.,00:51:16.720,00:51:18.250
"One is to locate the shock, the
shock line, when there is one,",00:51:18.250,00:51:27.800
"and two, to decide -- how do
we decide between shock or fan",00:51:27.800,00:51:36.240
"when from the point of
view of pure conservation,",00:51:36.240,00:51:44.150
we could choose.,00:51:44.150,00:51:46.400
But nature makes a choice.,00:51:46.400,00:51:49.290
"And one way to decide,
make that decision,",00:51:49.290,00:51:52.000
"is Burger's way of putting
in a little diffusion",00:51:52.000,00:51:55.170
"and letting it disappear,
but we need a direct rule.",00:51:55.170,00:52:01.280
"So we need a direct
entropy condition.",00:52:01.280,00:52:04.190
"So this is going to
be a shock speed --",00:52:04.190,00:52:09.700
"a formula for shock speed s
-- s equals shock speed --",00:52:09.700,00:52:14.280
"we'll find, if there is a shock.",00:52:14.280,00:52:18.260
"And number two is going to be
-- this decision is going to be",00:52:18.260,00:52:21.360
"based on a quantity
called entropy,",00:52:21.360,00:52:26.610
"which appears only in
nonlinear problems, really.",00:52:26.610,00:52:30.020
"OK, so that's a
beginning picture,",00:52:30.020,00:52:36.620
"which these 16.920 notes
are an excellent reference",00:52:36.620,00:52:46.180
"for, the book also.",00:52:46.180,00:52:48.800
"And Monday's lecture
will pick up there.",00:52:48.800,00:52:52.090
"So we can see the
two situations here,",00:52:52.090,00:52:56.570
"and the question is what
do we do at this point.",00:52:56.570,00:53:01.420
"OK, see you Monday.",00:53:01.420,00:53:02.820
Have a good weekend.,00:53:02.820,00:53:04.710
"And any email questions
about the homework,",00:53:04.710,00:53:08.800
"just you could send to me or --
and/or to -- maybe and to Mr.",00:53:08.800,00:53:13.460
"Cho, who will be looking at
the homeworks that come in.",00:53:13.460,00:53:17.590
"Good, thanks.",00:53:17.590,00:53:19.310
