Good morning.",00:00:17.600,00:00:24.030
"We should start with the
confession, for those of you",00:00:24.030,00:00:26.860
"looking at this on
OpenCourseWare, that I'm",00:00:26.860,00:00:29.990
"currently lecturing to
an empty auditorium.",00:00:29.990,00:00:34.760
"The fifth lecture for 600 this
term, we ran into some",00:00:34.760,00:00:38.750
"technical difficulties, which
left us with a recording we",00:00:38.750,00:00:43.810
weren't very satisfied with.,00:00:43.810,00:00:45.950
"So, I'm-- this is a redo, and if
you will hear no questions",00:00:45.950,00:00:51.220
"from the audience and that's
because there is no audience.",00:00:51.220,00:00:54.450
"Nevertheless I will do
my best to pretend.",00:00:54.450,00:00:57.860
"I've been told this is a little
bit like giving a",00:00:57.860,00:01:00.840
"speech before the US Congress
when C-SPAN is",00:01:00.840,00:01:04.570
the only thing watching.,00:01:04.570,00:01:07.280
OK.,00:01:07.280,00:01:09.840
"Computers are supposed to be
good for crunching numbers.",00:01:09.840,00:01:14.400
"And we've looked a little bit
at numbers this term, but I",00:01:14.400,00:01:18.600
"now want to get into looking
at them in more depth than",00:01:18.600,00:01:21.660
we've been doing.,00:01:21.660,00:01:23.050
"Python has two different
kinds of numbers.",00:01:23.050,00:01:32.090
"So far, the only kind we've
really paid any attention to",00:01:32.090,00:01:36.300
is type int.,00:01:36.300,00:01:40.450
"And those were intended to
mirror the integers, as we all",00:01:40.450,00:01:45.430
"learned about starting
in elementary school.",00:01:45.430,00:01:48.930
"And they're good for things
that you can count.",00:01:48.930,00:01:52.500
"Any place you'd use
whole numbers.",00:01:52.500,00:01:55.620
"Interestingly, Python, unlike
some languages, has what are",00:01:55.620,00:02:00.540
"called arbitrary precision
integers.",00:02:00.540,00:02:09.520
"By that, we mean, you can
make numbers as big as",00:02:09.520,00:02:12.730
you want them to.,00:02:12.730,00:02:14.380
Let's look at an example.,00:02:14.380,00:02:17.620
"We'll just take a for a variable
name, and we'll set a",00:02:17.620,00:02:21.260
"to be two raised to the
one-thousandth power.",00:02:21.260,00:02:27.050
"That, by the way, is a
really big number.",00:02:27.050,00:02:31.400
"And now what happens if
we try and display it?",00:02:31.400,00:02:34.820
We get a lot of digits.,00:02:34.820,00:02:37.340
"You can see why I'm doing this
on the screen instead of",00:02:37.340,00:02:39.770
writing it on the blackboard.,00:02:39.770,00:02:43.700
"I'm not going to ask you whether
you believe this is",00:02:43.700,00:02:45.640
"the right answer, trust
me, trust Python.",00:02:45.640,00:02:48.900
"I would like you to notice, at
the very end of this is the",00:02:48.900,00:02:52.080
letter L.,00:02:52.080,00:02:55.840
What does that mean?,00:02:55.840,00:02:58.280
It means long.,00:02:58.280,00:03:05.480
"That's telling us that it's
representing these-- this",00:03:05.480,00:03:10.030
"particular integer in
what it calls it's",00:03:10.030,00:03:13.900
internal long format.,00:03:13.900,00:03:18.290
You needn't worry about that.,00:03:18.290,00:03:20.440
"The only thing to say about it
is, when you're dealing with",00:03:20.440,00:03:22.760
"long integers, it's a lot less
efficient than when you're",00:03:22.760,00:03:26.190
dealing with smaller numbers.,00:03:26.190,00:03:28.870
"And that's all it's kind of
warning you, by printing this",00:03:28.870,00:03:31.370
L.,00:03:31.370,00:03:35.640
"About two billion is
the magic number.",00:03:35.640,00:03:38.260
"When you get over two billion,
it's now going to deal with",00:03:38.260,00:03:41.120
"long integers, so if, for
example, you're trying to deal",00:03:41.120,00:03:44.480
"with the US budget deficit, you
will need integers of type",00:03:44.480,00:03:48.030
L.,00:03:48.030,00:03:50.390
OK.,00:03:50.390,00:03:52.200
"Let's look at another
interesting example.",00:03:52.200,00:03:54.680
"Suppose I said, b equal to two
raised to the nine hundred",00:03:54.680,00:04:00.340
ninety-ninth power.,00:04:00.340,00:04:04.010
"I can display b, and it's a
different number, considerably",00:04:04.010,00:04:10.600
"smaller, but again,
ending in an L.",00:04:10.600,00:04:14.420
"And now, what you think I'll get
if we try a divided by b?",00:04:14.420,00:04:21.590
"And remember, we're now doing
integer division.",00:04:21.590,00:04:25.470
"Well, let's see.",00:04:25.470,00:04:27.800
We get 2L.,00:04:27.800,00:04:31.070
"Well, you'd expect it to be
two, because if you think",00:04:31.070,00:04:34.080
"about the meaning of
exponentiation, indeed, the",00:04:34.080,00:04:37.580
"difference between raising
something to the nine hundred",00:04:37.580,00:04:40.940
"ninety-ninth power and to the
one-thousandth power should",00:04:40.940,00:04:43.930
"be, in this case, two, since
that's what we're",00:04:43.930,00:04:46.990
raising to a power.,00:04:46.990,00:04:49.230
"Why does it say 2L, right?",00:04:49.230,00:04:52.370
"Two is considerably less than
two billion, and that's",00:04:52.370,00:04:56.070
"because once you get L, you
stay L. Not particularly",00:04:56.070,00:05:00.870
"important, but kind
of worth knowing.",00:05:00.870,00:05:04.900
"Well, why am I bothering you
with this whole issue of how",00:05:04.900,00:05:08.480
"numbers are represented
in the computer?",00:05:08.480,00:05:12.370
"In an ideal world, you would
ignore this completely, and",00:05:12.370,00:05:15.940
"just say, numbers do what
numbers are supposed to do.",00:05:15.940,00:05:20.090
"But as we're about to see,
sometimes in Python, and in",00:05:20.090,00:05:23.880
"fact in every programming
language, things behave",00:05:23.880,00:05:28.880
"contrary to what your
intuition suggests.",00:05:28.880,00:05:32.420
"And I want to spend a little
time helping you understand",00:05:32.420,00:05:35.770
why this happens.,00:05:35.770,00:05:38.530
"So let's look at a different
kind of number.",00:05:38.530,00:05:41.590
"And now we're going to look at
what Python, and almost every",00:05:41.590,00:05:48.620
"other programming language,
calls type float.",00:05:48.620,00:05:53.560
"Which is short for
floating point.",00:05:53.560,00:06:03.170
"And that's the way that
programming languages",00:06:03.170,00:06:06.160
"typically represent what we
think of as real numbers.",00:06:06.160,00:06:12.390
"So, let's look at an example.",00:06:12.390,00:06:15.050
"I'm going to set the variable
x to be 0.1, 1/10, and now",00:06:15.050,00:06:24.160
we're going to display x.,00:06:24.160,00:06:28.510
Huh?,00:06:28.510,00:06:29.750
Take a look at this.,00:06:29.750,00:06:31.640
Why isn't it .1?,00:06:31.640,00:06:34.740
"Why is it 0.1, a whole bunch
of zeros, and then this",00:06:34.740,00:06:38.770
"mysterious one appearing
at the end?",00:06:38.770,00:06:43.100
"Is it because Python just wants
to be obnoxious and is",00:06:43.100,00:06:45.900
making life hard?,00:06:45.900,00:06:47.960
"No, it has to do with the way
the numbers are represented",00:06:47.960,00:06:52.660
inside the computer.,00:06:52.660,00:06:54.280
"Python, like almost every modern
programming language,",00:06:54.280,00:06:59.800
"represents numbers using the
i triple e floating point",00:06:59.800,00:07:05.560
"standard, and it's
i triple e 754.",00:07:05.560,00:07:20.820
"Never again will you have to
remember that it's 754.",00:07:20.820,00:07:23.760
"I promise not to ask you that
question on a quiz.",00:07:23.760,00:07:27.480
But that's what they do.,00:07:27.480,00:07:29.320
"This is a variant of scientific
notation.",00:07:29.320,00:07:41.860
"Something you probably learned
about in high school, as a way",00:07:41.860,00:07:46.000
"to represent very
large numbers.",00:07:46.000,00:07:49.220
"Typically, the way we do that,
is we represent the numbers in",00:07:49.220,00:07:54.320
"the form of a mantissa
and an exponent.",00:07:54.320,00:08:07.730
"So we represent a floating point
number as a pair, of a",00:08:07.730,00:08:12.460
mantissa and an exponent.,00:08:12.460,00:08:20.260
"And because computers work in
the binary system, it's unlike",00:08:20.260,00:08:26.110
"what you probably learned in
high school, where we raise",00:08:26.110,00:08:29.410
ten to some power.,00:08:29.410,00:08:31.530
"Here we'll always be raising
two to some power.",00:08:31.530,00:08:35.710
"Maybe a little later in the
term, if we talk about",00:08:35.710,00:08:37.900
"computer architecture, we'll get
around to explaining why",00:08:37.900,00:08:40.500
"computers working binary, but
for now, just assume that they",00:08:40.500,00:08:45.720
do and in fact they,00:08:45.720,00:08:46.970
always have. All right.,00:08:46.970,00:08:50.810
"Purists manage to refer to the
mantissa as a significant, but",00:08:50.810,00:09:01.460
"I won't do that, because I'm
an old guy and it was a",00:09:01.460,00:09:05.400
"mantissa when I first learned
about it and I just can't",00:09:05.400,00:09:08.140
break myself of the habit.,00:09:08.140,00:09:11.460
All right.,00:09:11.460,00:09:11.870
So how does this work?,00:09:11.870,00:09:18.520
"Well, when we recognize so--
when we represent something,",00:09:18.520,00:09:22.450
"the mantissa is between
one and two.",00:09:22.450,00:09:35.360
Whoops.,00:09:35.360,00:09:37.270
"Strictly less than two, greater
than or equal to one.",00:09:37.270,00:09:42.090
"The exponent, is in the
range, -1022 to +1023.",00:09:42.090,00:10:07.420
"So this lets us represent
numbers up to about 10 to the",00:10:07.420,00:10:13.330
"308th, plus or minus 10 to
the 308th, plus or minus.",00:10:13.330,00:10:19.800
"So, quite a large range
of numbers.",00:10:19.800,00:10:24.050
"Where did these magic
things come from?",00:10:24.050,00:10:26.240
"You know, what-- kind of a
strange numbers to see here.",00:10:26.240,00:10:29.710
"Well, it has to do with the fact
that computers typically",00:10:29.710,00:10:37.040
"have words in them, and the
words today in a modern",00:10:37.040,00:10:41.830
computer are 64 bits.,00:10:41.830,00:10:46.370
"For many years they were 32
bits, before that they were 16",00:10:46.370,00:10:50.780
"bits, before that they were 8
bits, they've continually",00:10:50.780,00:10:54.520
"grown, but we've been at 64 for
a while and I think we'll",00:10:54.520,00:10:58.350
be stuck at 64 for a while.,00:10:58.350,00:11:02.300
"So as we do this, what we do
is, we get one bit for the",00:11:02.300,00:11:07.880
"sign-- is it a positive
or negative number?--",00:11:07.880,00:11:13.220
"11 for the exponent, and that
leaves 52 for the mantissa.",00:11:13.220,00:11:28.220
"And that basically tells us
how we're storing numbers.",00:11:28.220,00:11:32.340
"Hi, are you here for
the 600 lecture?",00:11:32.340,00:11:34.890
"There is none today, because we
have a quiz this evening.",00:11:34.890,00:11:40.840
"It's now the time that the
lecture would normally have",00:11:40.840,00:11:43.170
"started, and a couple of
students who forgot that we",00:11:43.170,00:11:46.450
"have a quiz this evening,
instead of a lecture, just",00:11:46.450,00:11:49.270
"strolled in, and now
strolled out.",00:11:49.270,00:11:53.780
OK.,00:11:53.780,00:11:55.620
"You may never need to know these
constants again, but",00:11:55.620,00:12:00.260
"it's worth knowing that they
exist, and that basically,",00:12:00.260,00:12:04.290
"this gives us about the
equivalent of seventeen",00:12:04.290,00:12:08.360
decimal digits of precision.,00:12:08.360,00:12:13.190
"So we can represent numbers
up to seventeen",00:12:13.190,00:12:16.810
decimal digits long.,00:12:16.810,00:12:21.520
"This is an important concept to
understand, that unlike the",00:12:21.520,00:12:26.410
"long ints where they can grow
arbitrarily big, when we're",00:12:26.410,00:12:30.220
"dealing with floating points, if
we need something more than",00:12:30.220,00:12:33.930
"seventeen decimal digits, in
Python at least, we won't be",00:12:33.930,00:12:37.980
able to get it.,00:12:37.980,00:12:39.570
"And that's true in
many languages.",00:12:39.570,00:12:41.740
"Now the good news is, this is
an enormous number, and it's",00:12:41.740,00:12:45.350
"highly unlikely that ever in
your life, you will need more",00:12:45.350,00:12:49.100
precision than that.,00:12:49.100,00:12:51.850
All right.,00:12:51.850,00:12:53.550
"Now, let's go back to the 0.1
mystery that we started at,",00:12:53.550,00:13:00.610
"and ask ourselves, why we have
a problem representing that",00:13:00.610,00:13:06.990
"number in the computer, hence,
we get something funny out",00:13:06.990,00:13:10.860
from we try and print it back.,00:13:10.860,00:13:14.700
"Well, let's look at an easier
problem first. Let's look at",00:13:14.700,00:13:19.090
representing the fraction 1/8.,00:13:19.090,00:13:26.420
That has a nice representation.,00:13:26.420,00:13:29.210
"That's equal in decimal to
0.125, and we can represent it",00:13:29.210,00:13:37.060
"conveniently in both
base 10 and base 2.",00:13:37.060,00:13:42.980
"So if you want to represent
it in base 10, what is it?",00:13:42.980,00:13:53.200
What is that equal to?,00:13:53.200,00:13:56.190
"Well, we'll take a mantissa,
1.25, and now we need to",00:13:56.190,00:14:02.010
"multiply it by something that
we can represent nicely, and",00:14:02.010,00:14:09.850
"in fact that will be
times 10 to the -1.",00:14:09.850,00:14:14.330
"So the exponent would simply
be -1, and we have a nice",00:14:14.330,00:14:17.880
representation.,00:14:17.880,00:14:20.760
"Suppose we want to represent
it in base 2?",00:14:20.760,00:14:24.760
What would it be?,00:14:24.760,00:14:29.260
1.0 times-- anybody?--,00:14:29.260,00:14:37.210
"Well, 2 to the -3.",00:14:37.210,00:14:44.040
"So, in binary notation, that
would be written as 0.001.",00:14:44.040,00:14:53.380
"So you see, 1/8 is kind
of a nice number.",00:14:53.380,00:14:56.190
"We can represent it nicely in
either base 10 or base 2.",00:14:56.190,00:15:01.850
"But how about that pesky
fraction 1/10?",00:15:01.850,00:15:14.970
"Well, in base 10, we know
how to represent, it's",00:15:14.970,00:15:20.010
1 times 10 to the--,00:15:20.010,00:15:27.390
10 to the what?--,00:15:27.390,00:15:28.420
10 to the 1?,00:15:28.420,00:15:30.110
No.,00:15:30.110,00:15:32.930
"But in base 2, it's a problem.",00:15:32.930,00:15:41.110
"There is no finite binary number
that exactly represents",00:15:41.110,00:15:47.320
this decimal fraction.,00:15:47.320,00:15:51.390
"In fact, if we try and find
the binary number, what we",00:15:51.390,00:15:55.360
"find is, we get an infinitely
repeating series.",00:15:55.360,00:15:59.710
"Zero zero zero one one zero
zero one one zero",00:15:59.710,00:16:06.570
"zero, and et cetera.",00:16:06.570,00:16:09.970
"Stop at any finite number of
bits, and you get only an",00:16:09.970,00:16:14.500
"approximation to the decimal
fraction 1/10.",00:16:14.500,00:16:20.770
"So on most computers, if you
were to print the decimal",00:16:20.770,00:16:27.250
"value of the binary
approximation-- and that's",00:16:27.250,00:16:31.160
"what we're printing here,
on this screen, right?",00:16:31.160,00:16:33.660
"We think in decimal, so Python
quite nicely for us is",00:16:33.660,00:16:37.960
"printing things in decimal--
it would have to display--",00:16:37.960,00:16:43.160
"well I'm not going to write it,
it's a very long number,",00:16:43.160,00:16:47.190
"lots of digits-- however, in
Python, whenever we display",00:16:47.190,00:16:55.190
"something, it uses the built-in
function repr, short",00:16:55.190,00:17:01.130
"for representation, that it
converts the internal",00:17:01.130,00:17:05.950
"representation in this case of
a number, to a string, and",00:17:05.950,00:17:10.690
"then displays that string in
this case on the screen.",00:17:10.690,00:17:15.510
"For floats, it rounds it
to seventeen digits.",00:17:15.510,00:17:24.040
"There's that magic number
seventeen again.",00:17:24.040,00:17:31.060
"Hence, when it rounds it to
seventeen digits, we get",00:17:31.060,00:17:36.470
"exactly what you see in the
bottom of the screen up there.",00:17:36.470,00:17:44.160
"Answer to the mystery, why
does it display this?",00:17:44.160,00:17:49.240
Now why should we care?,00:17:49.240,00:17:52.470
"Well, it's not so much that
we care about what gets",00:17:52.470,00:17:54.900
"displayed, but we have to think
about the implications,",00:17:54.900,00:17:59.010
"at least sometimes we have to
think about the implications,",00:17:59.010,00:18:02.250
"of what this inexact
representation of numbers",00:18:02.250,00:18:05.510
"means when we start doing
more-or-less complex",00:18:05.510,00:18:09.970
computations on those numbers.,00:18:09.970,00:18:13.250
"So let's look at a little
example here.",00:18:13.250,00:18:17.140
"I'll start by starting the
variable s to 0.0 .",00:18:17.140,00:18:21.300
"Notice I'm being careful
to make it a float.",00:18:21.300,00:18:24.320
"And then for i in range, let's
see, let's take 10, we'll",00:18:24.320,00:18:33.960
increase s by 0.1 .,00:18:33.960,00:18:44.710
"All right, we've done that,
and now, what happens",00:18:44.710,00:18:47.850
when I print s?,00:18:47.850,00:18:52.330
"Well, again you don't get
what your intuition",00:18:52.330,00:18:56.140
says you should get.,00:18:56.140,00:18:58.230
"Notice the last two digits,
which are eight and nine.",00:18:58.230,00:19:05.470
"Well, what's happening here?",00:19:05.470,00:19:09.760
"What's happened, is the
error has accumulated.",00:19:09.760,00:19:13.670
"I had a small error when I
started, but every time I",00:19:13.670,00:19:17.180
"added it, the error got bigger
and it accumulates.",00:19:17.180,00:19:22.550
"Sometimes you can get in trouble
in a computation",00:19:22.550,00:19:27.170
because of that.,00:19:27.170,00:19:30.410
"Now what happens, by the
way, if I print s?",00:19:30.410,00:19:32.940
"That's kind of an interesting
question.",00:19:32.940,00:19:36.130
Notice that it prints one.,00:19:36.130,00:19:40.810
And why is that?,00:19:40.810,00:19:42.550
"It's because the print command
has done a rounding here.",00:19:42.550,00:19:46.130
It automatically rounds.,00:19:46.130,00:19:50.360
"And that's kind of good, but
it's also kind of bad, because",00:19:50.360,00:19:54.810
"that means when you're debugging
your program, you",00:19:54.810,00:19:56.980
can get very confused.,00:19:56.980,00:19:59.010
"You say, it says it's one, why
am I getting a different",00:19:59.010,00:20:02.470
"answer when I do the
computation?",00:20:02.470,00:20:04.880
"And that's because it's
not really one inside.",00:20:04.880,00:20:08.100
So you have to be careful.,00:20:08.100,00:20:10.740
"Now mostly, these round-off
errors balance each other out.",00:20:10.740,00:20:16.040
"Some floats are slightly higher
than they're supposed",00:20:16.040,00:20:18.690
"to be, some are slightly
lower, and in most",00:20:18.690,00:20:21.480
"computations it all comes out
in the wash and you get the",00:20:21.480,00:20:24.250
right answer.,00:20:24.250,00:20:25.810
"Truth be told, most of the time,
you can avoid worrying",00:20:25.810,00:20:30.390
about these things.,00:20:30.390,00:20:32.110
"But, as we say in Latin,
caveat computor.",00:20:32.110,00:20:37.400
"Sometimes you have to
worry a little bit.",00:20:37.400,00:20:40.490
"Now there is one thing about
floating points about which",00:20:40.490,00:20:44.860
you should always worry.,00:20:44.860,00:20:49.720
"And that's really the point I
want to drive home, and that's",00:20:49.720,00:20:54.140
"about the meaning
of double equal.",00:20:54.140,00:21:08.260
"Let's look at an example
of this.",00:21:08.260,00:21:12.950
"So we've before seen the use
of import, so I'm going to",00:21:12.950,00:21:16.700
"import math, it gives me some
useful mathematical functions,",00:21:16.700,00:21:21.670
"then I'm going to set the
variable a to the",00:21:21.670,00:21:24.440
square root of two.,00:21:24.440,00:21:29.190
Whoops.,00:21:29.190,00:21:31.590
Why didn't this work?,00:21:31.590,00:21:33.090
"Because what I should have
said is math dot",00:21:33.090,00:21:36.590
square root of two.,00:21:36.590,00:21:42.100
"Explaining to the interpreter
that I want to get the",00:21:42.100,00:21:45.380
"function sqrt from
the module math.",00:21:45.380,00:21:52.600
"So now I've got a here, and I
can look at what a is, yeah,",00:21:52.600,00:21:59.520
"some approximation to the square
root about of two.",00:21:59.520,00:22:02.970
"Now here's the interesting
question.",00:22:02.970,00:22:04.560
"Suppose I ask about the Boolean
a times a equals",00:22:04.560,00:22:10.880
equals two.,00:22:10.880,00:22:13.010
"Now in my heart, I think, if
I've taken the square root of",00:22:13.010,00:22:16.440
"number and then I've multiplied
it by itself, I",00:22:16.440,00:22:19.780
"could get the original
number back.",00:22:19.780,00:22:22.060
"After all, that's the meaning
of square root.",00:22:22.060,00:22:25.430
"But by now, you won't be
surprised if the answer of",00:22:25.430,00:22:28.460
"this is false, because we know
what we've stored is only an",00:22:28.460,00:22:33.020
"approximation to the
square root.",00:22:33.020,00:22:37.650
"And that's kind of
interesting.",00:22:37.650,00:22:39.040
"So we can see that, by, if I
look at a times a, I'll get",00:22:39.040,00:22:44.460
"two point a whole bunch
of zeros and then",00:22:44.460,00:22:46.265
a four at the end.,00:22:46.265,00:22:48.730
"So this means, if I've got a
test in my program, in some",00:22:48.730,00:22:53.150
"sense it will give me the
unexpected answer false.",00:22:53.150,00:22:58.870
"What this tells us, is that it's
very risky to ever use",00:22:58.870,00:23:04.440
"the built-in double--equals to
compare floating points, and",00:23:04.440,00:23:08.870
"in fact, you should never be
testing for equality, you",00:23:08.870,00:23:13.100
"should always be testing
for close enough.",00:23:13.100,00:23:18.790
"So typically, what you want to
do in your program, is ask the",00:23:18.790,00:23:22.840
"following question: is the
absolute value of a times a",00:23:22.840,00:23:30.530
minus 2.0 less than epsilon?,00:23:30.530,00:23:40.610
"If we could easily type Greek,
we'd have written it that way,",00:23:40.610,00:23:43.280
but we can't.,00:23:43.280,00:23:46.380
"So that's some small value
chosen to be appropriate for",00:23:46.380,00:23:50.840
the application.,00:23:50.840,00:23:52.520
"Saying, if these two things
are within epsilon of each",00:23:52.520,00:23:55.680
"other, then I'm going to
treat them as equal.",00:23:55.680,00:24:00.870
"And so what I typically do when
I'm writing a Python code",00:24:00.870,00:24:04.020
"that's going to deal with
floating point numbers, and I",00:24:04.020,00:24:06.990
"do this from time to time, is I
introduce a function called",00:24:06.990,00:24:12.040
"almost equal, or near, or pick
your favorite word, that does",00:24:12.040,00:24:18.940
this for me.,00:24:18.940,00:24:20.070
"And wherever I would normally
written double x equals y,",00:24:20.070,00:24:24.310
"instead I write, near x,y, and
it computes it for me.",00:24:24.310,00:24:31.960
"Not a big deal, but keep this
in mind, or as soon as you",00:24:31.960,00:24:36.340
"start dealing with numbers, you
will get very frustrated",00:24:36.340,00:24:39.390
"in trying to understand what
your program does.",00:24:39.390,00:24:43.350
OK.,00:24:43.350,00:24:45.940
"Enough of numbers for a while,
I'm sure some of you will find",00:24:45.940,00:24:48.600
this a relief.,00:24:48.600,00:24:52.100
"I now want to get away from
details of floating point, and",00:24:52.100,00:24:57.380
"talk about general methods
again, returning to the real",00:24:57.380,00:25:01.690
"theme of the course of solving
problems using computers.",00:25:01.690,00:25:06.770
"Last week, we looked at the
rather silly problem of",00:25:06.770,00:25:11.070
"finding the square root
of a perfect square.",00:25:11.070,00:25:15.760
"Well, that's not usually
what you need.",00:25:15.760,00:25:21.640
"Let's think about the more
useful problem of finding the",00:25:21.640,00:25:25.170
square root of a real number.,00:25:25.170,00:25:27.640
"Well, you've just seen
how you do that.",00:25:27.640,00:25:29.580
"You import math and
you call sqrt.",00:25:29.580,00:25:32.680
"Let's pretend that we didn't
know that trick, or let's",00:25:32.680,00:25:36.640
"pretend it's your job to
introduce-- implement,",00:25:36.640,00:25:39.750
rather-- math.,00:25:39.750,00:25:41.200
"And so, you need to figure out
how to implement square root.",00:25:41.200,00:25:46.250
Why might this be a challenge?,00:25:46.250,00:25:49.190
What are some of the issues?,00:25:49.190,00:25:52.230
And there are several.,00:25:52.230,00:25:53.900
"One is, what we've just seen
might not be an exact answer.",00:25:53.900,00:26:09.960
"For example, the square
root of two.",00:26:09.960,00:26:16.460
"So we need to worry about that,
and clearly the way",00:26:16.460,00:26:20.400
"we're going to solve that, as
we'll see, is using a concept",00:26:20.400,00:26:24.980
similar to epsilon.,00:26:24.980,00:26:26.940
"In fact, we'll even
call it epsilon.",00:26:26.940,00:26:33.100
"Another problem with the method
we looked at last time",00:26:33.100,00:26:36.620
"is, there we were doing
exhaustive enumeration.",00:26:36.620,00:26:40.100
"We were enumerating all the
possible answers, checking",00:26:40.100,00:26:44.040
"each one, and if it was
good, stopping.",00:26:44.040,00:26:47.680
"Well, the problem with reals, as
opposed to integers, is we",00:26:47.680,00:26:55.380
can't enumerate all guesses.,00:26:55.380,00:27:06.310
"And that's because the reals
are uncountable.",00:27:06.310,00:27:14.540
"If I ask you to enumerate the
positive integers, you'll say",00:27:14.540,00:27:19.280
"one, two, three, four, five.",00:27:19.280,00:27:22.350
"If I ask you to enumerate the
reals, the positive reals,",00:27:22.350,00:27:28.880
where do you start?,00:27:28.880,00:27:29.950
"One over a billion,
plus who knows?",00:27:29.950,00:27:32.960
"Now as we've just seen in fact,
since there's a limit to",00:27:32.960,00:27:37.610
"the precision floating point,
technically you can enumerate",00:27:37.610,00:27:42.000
"all the floating
point numbers.",00:27:42.000,00:27:44.970
"And I say technically, because
if you tried to do that, your",00:27:44.970,00:27:48.510
"computation would not terminate
any time soon.",00:27:48.510,00:27:53.630
"So even though in some, in
principle you could enumerate",00:27:53.630,00:27:57.050
"them, in fact you
really can't.",00:27:57.050,00:27:59.780
"And so we think of the floating
points, like the",00:27:59.780,00:28:02.280
"reals, as being innumerable.",00:28:02.280,00:28:04.900
"Or not innumerable, as to say
as being uncountable.",00:28:04.900,00:28:10.020
So we can't do that.,00:28:10.020,00:28:14.160
"So we have to find something
clever, because we're now",00:28:14.160,00:28:19.450
"searching a very large space
of possible answers.",00:28:19.450,00:28:24.220
"What would, technically
you might call",00:28:24.220,00:28:26.502
a large state space.,00:28:26.502,00:28:29.400
"So we're going to take our
previous method of guess and",00:28:29.400,00:28:33.240
"check, and replace it by
something called guess, check,",00:28:33.240,00:28:41.850
and improve.,00:28:41.850,00:28:45.430
"Previously, we just generated
guesses in some systematic",00:28:45.430,00:28:50.290
"way, but without knowing
that we were getting",00:28:50.290,00:28:53.010
closer to the answer.,00:28:53.010,00:28:55.130
"Think of the original barnyard
problem with the chickens and",00:28:55.130,00:28:58.270
"the heads and the legs, we just
enumerated possibilities,",00:28:58.270,00:29:01.900
"but we didn't know that one
guess was better than the",00:29:01.900,00:29:04.440
previous guess.,00:29:04.440,00:29:07.690
"Now, we're going to find a way
to do the enumeration where we",00:29:07.690,00:29:12.600
"have good reason to believe,
at least with high",00:29:12.600,00:29:18.190
"probability, that each
guess is better than",00:29:18.190,00:29:22.940
the previous guess.,00:29:22.940,00:29:25.330
"This is what's called successive
approximation.",00:29:25.330,00:29:41.610
"And that's a very important

discover what that is.,00:35:57.500,00:36:00.480
"So, it takes two arguments; x,
the number whose square root",00:36:00.480,00:36:04.900
"we're looking for,
and epsilon, how",00:36:04.900,00:36:07.620
close we need to get.,00:36:07.620,00:36:09.910
"It assumes that x is
non-negative, and that epsilon",00:36:09.910,00:36:15.750
is greater than zero.,00:36:15.750,00:36:18.440
"Why do we need to assume
that's epsilon is",00:36:18.440,00:36:20.210
greater than zero?,00:36:20.210,00:36:21.950
"Well, if you made epsilon zero,
and then say, we're",00:36:21.950,00:36:24.380
"looking for the square root
of two, we know we'll",00:36:24.380,00:36:26.680
never get an answer.,00:36:26.680,00:36:29.850

and then it returns y such",00:36:29.850,00:36:35.470
"that y times y is within
epsilon of x.",00:36:35.470,00:36:39.410
"It's near, to use the
terminology we used before.",00:36:39.410,00:36:44.400
"The next thing we see in the
program, is two assert",00:36:44.400,00:36:47.830
statements.,00:36:47.830,00:36:49.860
"This is because I never trust

"functions to do the
right thing.",00:36:54.520,00:36:57.360

assume certain things about",00:36:57.360,00:37:00.670
"x and epsilon, I'm actually
going to test it.",00:37:00.670,00:37:04.240
"And so, I'm going to assert
that x is greater than or",00:37:04.240,00:37:07.630
"equal to zero, and that epsilon
is greater than zero.",00:37:07.630,00:37:11.710

the predicate, say x greater",00:37:11.710,00:37:16.603
"than or equal to zero, if it's
true, it does nothing, just",00:37:16.603,00:37:21.450
goes on to the next statement.,00:37:21.450,00:37:23.160
"But if it's false, it prints a
message, the string, which is",00:37:23.160,00:37:28.390
"my second argument here, and
then the program just stops.",00:37:28.390,00:37:33.180

off and doing something",00:37:33.180,00:37:35.610

forever, it just stops with a",00:37:35.610,00:37:39.490

with arguments you shouldn't",00:37:39.490,00:37:42.460
have called me with.,00:37:42.460,00:37:45.900

specification and then my",00:37:45.900,00:37:49.570
check of the assumptions.,00:37:49.570,00:37:52.950
"The next thing it does, is it
looks for a range such that I",00:37:52.950,00:37:59.800
"believe I am assured that my
answer lies between the ran--",00:37:59.800,00:38:04.070
"these values, and I'm going to
say, well, my answer will be",00:38:04.070,00:38:08.260
"no smaller than zero, and
no bigger than x.",00:38:08.260,00:38:13.970
"Now, is this the tightest
possible range?",00:38:13.970,00:38:16.040
"Maybe not, but I'm not
too fussy about that.",00:38:16.040,00:38:19.280
"I'm just trying to make sure
that I cover the space.",00:38:19.280,00:38:25.010
"Then I'll start with a guess,
and again I'm not going to",00:38:25.010,00:38:28.470
"worry too much about the guess,
I'm going to take low",00:38:28.470,00:38:31.630
"plus high and divide by two,
that is to say, choose",00:38:31.630,00:38:36.220
"something in the middle of
this space, and then",00:38:36.220,00:38:40.240
"essentially do what
we've got here.",00:38:40.240,00:38:44.180
"So it's a little bit more
involved here, I'm going to",00:38:44.180,00:38:46.620
"set my counter to one, just to
keep checking, then say, while",00:38:46.620,00:38:52.130
"the absolute value of the
guess squared minus x is",00:38:52.130,00:38:55.950
"greater than epsilon, that is
to say, why my guess is not",00:38:55.950,00:38:59.340
"yet good enough, and the counter
is not greater than a",00:38:59.340,00:39:03.390
"hundred, I'll get
the next guess.",00:39:03.390,00:39:09.220
"Notice by the way, I have a
print statement here which",00:39:09.220,00:39:11.480
"I've commented out, but I sort
of figured that my program",00:39:11.480,00:39:15.120
"would not work correctly the
first time, and so, I, when I",00:39:15.120,00:39:20.500
"first typed and put in a print
statement, it would let me see",00:39:20.500,00:39:24.000
"what was happening each
iteration through this loop,",00:39:24.000,00:39:27.100
"so that if it didn't work, I
could get a sense of why not.",00:39:27.100,00:39:30.980
"In the next lecture, when we
look for the bug in this",00:39:30.980,00:39:33.760
"program, you will see me
uncomment out that print",00:39:33.760,00:39:36.880
"statement, but for now, we
go to the next thing.",00:39:36.880,00:39:42.720
"And we're here, we know the
guess wasn't good enough, so I",00:39:42.720,00:39:46.200
"now say, if the guess squared
was less than x, then I will",00:39:46.200,00:39:52.690
"change the low bound
to be the guess.",00:39:52.690,00:39:58.330
"Otherwise, I'll change the high
bound to be the guess.",00:39:58.330,00:40:03.100
"So I move either the low bound
or I move the high bound,",00:40:03.100,00:40:05.960
"either way I'm cutting
the search space",00:40:05.960,00:40:07.960
in half each step.,00:40:07.960,00:40:10.530
I'll get my new guess.,00:40:10.530,00:40:13.110
"I'll increment my counter,
and off I go.",00:40:13.110,00:40:17.970
"In the happy event that
eventually I get a good enough",00:40:17.970,00:40:20.440
"guess, you'll see a--",00:40:20.440,00:40:23.230
I'll exit the loop.,00:40:23.230,00:40:26.160
"When I exit the loop, I checked,
did I exit it because",00:40:26.160,00:40:30.030
"I exceeded the counter,
I didn't have",00:40:30.030,00:40:32.530
a good-enough guess.,00:40:32.530,00:40:34.150
"If so, I'll print the message
iteration count exceeded.",00:40:34.150,00:40:39.140
"Otherwise, I'll print the
result and return it.",00:40:39.140,00:40:46.300
"Now again, if I were writing a
square root function to be",00:40:46.300,00:40:48.740
"used in another program, I
probably wouldn't bother",00:40:48.740,00:40:51.570
"printing the result and the
number of iterations and all",00:40:51.570,00:40:54.140
"of that, but again, I'm doing
that here for, because we want",00:40:54.140,00:40:57.950
to see what it's doing.,00:40:57.950,00:40:58.780
All right.,00:40:58.780,00:41:00.240
"We'll run it a couple times
and then I'll let",00:41:00.240,00:41:02.580
you out for the day.,00:41:02.580,00:41:06.420
Let's go do this.,00:41:06.420,00:41:20.600
All right.,00:41:20.600,00:41:21.850
We're here.,00:41:21.850,00:41:23.200
"Well, notice when I run
it, nothing happens.",00:41:23.200,00:41:25.280
Why did nothing happen?,00:41:25.280,00:41:26.960
"Well, nothing happens, it
was just a function.",00:41:26.960,00:41:29.690
"Functions don't do anything
until I call them.",00:41:29.690,00:41:33.030
So let's call it.,00:41:33.030,00:41:37.360
"Let's call square root bi with
40.001 Took only one at--",00:41:37.360,00:41:49.860
"iteration, that was pretty
fast, estimated two as an",00:41:49.860,00:41:52.970
"answer, we're pretty happy
with that answer.",00:41:52.970,00:41:55.720
Let's try another example.,00:41:55.720,00:41:59.990
Let's look at nine.,00:41:59.990,00:42:03.320
"I always like to, by the way,
start with questions whose",00:42:03.320,00:42:05.530
answer I know.,00:42:05.530,00:42:08.690
"We'll try and get a little
bit more precise.",00:42:08.690,00:42:11.160
"Well, all right.",00:42:11.160,00:42:12.360
"Here it took eighteen
iterations.",00:42:12.360,00:42:16.620
"Didn't actually give me the
answer three, which we know",00:42:16.620,00:42:19.910
"happens to be the answer, but it
gave me something that was",00:42:19.910,00:42:24.100
"within epsilon of three, so it
meets the specification, so I",00:42:24.100,00:42:28.900
should be perfectly happy.,00:42:28.900,00:42:32.430
Let's look at another example.,00:42:32.430,00:42:38.690
Try a bigger number here.,00:42:38.690,00:42:46.960
All right?,00:42:46.960,00:42:47.310
"So I've looked for the square
root of a thousand, here it",00:42:47.310,00:42:50.310
"took twenty-nine iterations,
we're kind of creeping up",00:42:50.310,00:42:53.000
"there, gave me an estimate.",00:42:53.000,00:42:55.960
"Ah, let's look at our infamous
example of two, see",00:42:55.960,00:42:59.280
what it does here.,00:42:59.280,00:43:12.200
Worked around.,00:43:12.200,00:43:14.030
"Now, we can see it's actually
working, and I'm getting",00:43:14.030,00:43:20.790
"answers that we believe are
good-enough answers, but we",00:43:20.790,00:43:25.670
"also see that the speed of
what we talk about as",00:43:25.670,00:43:28.250
"convergence-- how many
iterations it takes, the",00:43:28.250,00:43:31.270

variable, and it seems to be",00:43:31.270,00:43:35.480
