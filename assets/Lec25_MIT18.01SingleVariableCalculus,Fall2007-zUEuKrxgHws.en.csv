"PROFESSOR: Now, today I need
to get started by finishing up",00:00:21.270,00:00:26.900
what I did last time.,00:00:26.900,00:00:28.480
"Namely, talking about
numerical methods.",00:00:28.480,00:00:31.560
"And I want to just
carry out one example.",00:00:31.560,00:00:34.680
"And then I want to
fill in one loose end.",00:00:34.680,00:00:40.660
"And then we'll talk
about the unit overall.",00:00:40.660,00:00:48.870
"We were talking, last time,
about numerical integration.",00:00:48.870,00:01:01.720
"I'm going to illustrate this
just with the simplest example",00:01:01.720,00:01:05.580
that I can.,00:01:05.580,00:01:07.960
"We're going to look at the
integral from 1 to 2 of dx / x.",00:01:07.960,00:01:14.070
"Which we know
perfectly well already",00:01:14.070,00:01:16.720
"is the log of x evaluated
between 1 and 2, which is ln 2",00:01:16.720,00:01:21.310
- ln 1.,00:01:21.310,00:01:23.250
Which is just ln 2.,00:01:23.250,00:01:26.080
"Now, if you punch that
into your calculator,",00:01:26.080,00:01:29.750
"you're going to get
something like this.",00:01:29.750,00:01:32.610
I hope I saved it here.,00:01:32.610,00:01:41.030
Yeah.,00:01:41.030,00:01:41.530
It's about 0.693147.,00:01:41.530,00:01:53.250
"That's more digits than we're
going to get in our discussion",00:01:53.250,00:01:56.150
here.,00:01:56.150,00:01:56.650
"Anyway, that's about
how big this number is.",00:01:56.650,00:02:02.490
"And the numerical
integration methods",00:02:02.490,00:02:06.390
"will give you about as
much accuracy as you",00:02:06.390,00:02:10.760
can get on the function itself.,00:02:10.760,00:02:13.270
"And, of course,
some functions we",00:02:13.270,00:02:15.100
"may have more trouble
approximating.",00:02:15.100,00:02:17.040
"But the function 1 / x, we
know pretty well how to do,",00:02:17.040,00:02:19.400
because we know how to divide.,00:02:19.400,00:02:21.440
"So since the function that
we're integrating here is 1 / x,",00:02:21.440,00:02:26.410
"it's going to be not
too difficult to get",00:02:26.410,00:02:28.874
some arithmetic.,00:02:28.874,00:02:29.540
"Nevertheless, I'm
going to do this",00:02:29.540,00:02:31.740
in the simplest possible case.,00:02:31.740,00:02:34.210
"Namely, just with two intervals.",00:02:34.210,00:02:44.040
"Now, you really can't expect
things to work so well",00:02:44.040,00:02:47.020
with two intervals.,00:02:47.020,00:02:48.040
"That's a pretty ridiculous
approximation to your function.",00:02:48.040,00:02:52.560
"When you have two
intervals, that",00:02:52.560,00:02:54.830
"means you're looking at the
graph of this hyperbola.",00:02:54.830,00:02:58.490
"And you have 1 here, and you
have 2 here and you have 3/2.",00:02:58.490,00:03:04.510
"And you're really only
keeping track of the values",00:03:04.510,00:03:07.910
at these three spots.,00:03:07.910,00:03:10.880
"So the idea that you can
approximate the area just",00:03:10.880,00:03:14.630
"by knowing the values
of three places",00:03:14.630,00:03:16.940
"is a little bit of a
stretch of the imagination.",00:03:16.940,00:03:21.120
"But we're going
to try it anyway.",00:03:21.120,00:03:24.850
"Now, the trapezoidal rule
is the following formula.",00:03:24.850,00:03:33.320
"It's delta x (1/2 the first
value + the second value",00:03:33.320,00:03:38.980
+ 1/2 the third value).,00:03:38.980,00:03:42.290
"In this case, the pattern
is 1/2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1/2.",00:03:42.290,00:03:47.930
"And in this case, delta x =
1/2 because this interval's",00:03:47.930,00:03:53.540
of length 1.,00:03:53.540,00:03:55.120
"The b - a, right.",00:03:55.120,00:03:57.680
Let's just point that out here.,00:03:57.680,00:03:59.990
"Here, b = 2. a = 1. b - a = 1.",00:03:59.990,00:04:05.410
And the number n is 2.,00:04:05.410,00:04:08.500
"And so, delta x, which
is (b - a) / n, is 1/2.",00:04:08.500,00:04:16.160
So here's what we get.,00:04:16.160,00:04:17.580
"And let's just see
what this number is.",00:04:17.580,00:04:19.850
It's 1/2 of the value at here.,00:04:19.850,00:04:23.540
"Well, so let's just check
what these values are.",00:04:23.540,00:04:25.540
"This value is 1, this
value over here is 2/3,",00:04:25.540,00:04:29.560
and the last value is 1/2.,00:04:29.560,00:04:33.320
"Because the function, of
course, was y = 1 / x.",00:04:33.320,00:04:36.766
"And those were the three
values that we have.",00:04:36.766,00:04:38.640
"So y_0, this one is
y_0, this one is y_1,",00:04:38.640,00:04:42.030
and this one is y_2.,00:04:42.030,00:04:47.480
"Now, here we have 1/2*
1 + 2/3 + 1/2 * 1/2.",00:04:47.480,00:05:00.780
"Now, on an exam,
I don't expect you",00:05:00.780,00:05:03.900
"to add up long messes
of numbers like this.",00:05:03.900,00:05:07.930
"When you have two
numbers, I expect",00:05:07.930,00:05:09.700
"you to add them up if they're
reasonable, or subtract them.",00:05:09.700,00:05:12.670
"Just as we do when we
take antiderivatives.",00:05:12.670,00:05:14.530
"Like, for example,
I don't want you",00:05:14.530,00:05:16.660
"to leave the answer to
an integration like this",00:05:16.660,00:05:18.860
in this form.,00:05:18.860,00:05:19.490
"I want you to simplify
it at least down to here.",00:05:19.490,00:05:21.514
"And I of course don't
expect you to know",00:05:21.514,00:05:23.180
the numerical approximation.,00:05:23.180,00:05:24.880
"But I certainly expect
you to be able to do that.",00:05:24.880,00:05:27.417
"On the other hand,
when the arithmetic",00:05:27.417,00:05:29.000
"gets a little bit long,
you can relax a little bit.",00:05:29.000,00:05:32.360
"But I did carry this
out on my calculator.",00:05:32.360,00:05:35.210
"Unless I'm mistaken,
it's about 0.96.",00:05:35.210,00:05:41.240
It's pretty far off.,00:05:41.240,00:05:44.820
So remember what it was.,00:05:44.820,00:05:47.484
"It's what you get when you
get these straight lines.",00:05:47.484,00:05:49.650
"And there are these little
extra pieces of junk there.",00:05:49.650,00:05:52.170
"Now, don't trust that
too much, but the point",00:05:52.170,00:05:55.870
is that it's far off.,00:05:55.870,00:06:00.540
"So now, let's take a
look at Simpson's Rule.",00:06:00.540,00:06:09.760
"And I claim that Simpson's
Rule is surprisingly accurate.",00:06:09.760,00:06:13.500
"In this case, really,
even a little more than it",00:06:13.500,00:06:15.500
deserves to be.,00:06:15.500,00:06:17.410
"The formula is (delta x
/ 3) (y_0 + 4 y_1 + y_2).",00:06:17.410,00:06:29.400
"So the pattern is
1, 4, 1, or 1, 4",00:06:29.400,00:06:32.460
"and then it alternates 2's and
4's until 4, 1 at the very end.",00:06:32.460,00:06:39.200
"And if I just plug in the
numbers now, what I get",00:06:39.200,00:06:43.060
"is 1/6, because
delta x = 1/2 again.",00:06:43.060,00:06:47.340
And the value for y_0 was 1.,00:06:47.340,00:06:50.600
And the value for y_1 was 2/3.,00:06:50.600,00:06:55.120
And the value for y_2 was 1/2.,00:06:55.120,00:06:59.350
"So here's the
estimate in this case.",00:06:59.350,00:07:03.740
"And this one I did
carry out carefully.",00:07:03.740,00:07:08.540
And it came out to 0.69444.,00:07:08.540,00:07:16.880
"Which is actually
pretty impressive,",00:07:16.880,00:07:18.810
if you think about it.,00:07:18.810,00:07:20.490
Given what the logarithm is.,00:07:20.490,00:07:26.050
"Now, what's going on with
Simpson's Rule in general",00:07:26.050,00:07:31.740
is this.,00:07:31.740,00:07:33.240
"If you-- Simpson's
minus the exact answer,",00:07:33.240,00:07:43.360
"in absolute value, is
approximately of the size",00:07:43.360,00:07:46.970
of (delta x)^4.,00:07:46.970,00:07:50.850
"That's really the
way it behaves.",00:07:50.850,00:07:52.730
"Which means that if
delta x is about 1/10,",00:07:52.730,00:08:03.300
"so if we had divided this
up into 10 intervals,",00:08:03.300,00:08:05.670
"which we didn't, but if
we'd divided it up into 10",00:08:05.670,00:08:08.270
"intervals, then you could
expect that delta x--",00:08:08.270,00:08:11.585
"the error would
be about 10^(-4).",00:08:11.585,00:08:15.320
"In other words, four digits of
accuracy here for this thing.",00:08:15.320,00:08:21.090
"But the exact analysis of
this, a more careful analysis",00:08:21.090,00:08:25.940
"of this, is in your textbook.",00:08:25.940,00:08:27.640
And I'm not going to do it.,00:08:27.640,00:08:30.820
"But I just want to point out
that it is an effective method.",00:08:30.820,00:08:33.750
"It really does give
you nice four-digit",00:08:33.750,00:08:35.830
"with manageable-- you could
even really do it by hand.",00:08:35.830,00:08:38.510
"It's so convenient,
the Simpson's Rule.",00:08:38.510,00:08:42.040
"Whereas the other rules
aren't really that impressive",00:08:42.040,00:08:46.140
"as far as giving fairly
accurate answers.",00:08:46.140,00:08:51.790
"The last little
remark to make is",00:08:51.790,00:08:54.330
"that the reason is
that Simpson's Rule is",00:08:54.330,00:08:57.520
matching a parabola.,00:08:57.520,00:08:59.300
"And somehow the parabola
follows this curve better.",00:08:59.300,00:09:03.650
It's giving the exact answer.,00:09:03.650,00:09:05.890
So I'll mention this.,00:09:05.890,00:09:07.570
"Simpson's Rule is derived
using the exact answer",00:09:07.570,00:09:23.590
for all degree 2 polynomials.,00:09:23.590,00:09:32.770
"In other words, parabolas.",00:09:32.770,00:09:36.680
All parabolas.,00:09:36.680,00:09:38.410
"But even all the
ones of lower degree.",00:09:38.410,00:09:40.450
"So straight lines would
work, and constants",00:09:40.450,00:09:43.360
would work as well.,00:09:43.360,00:09:44.390
"Whereas the other ones only
work for, say, straight lines.",00:09:44.390,00:09:47.770
"The trapezoidal rule only
works for straight lines.",00:09:47.770,00:09:51.200
But there is a weird accident.,00:09:51.200,00:09:53.110
"It turns out that it
also works for cubics.",00:09:53.110,00:09:55.650
"Once you get the formulas,
it works for cubics.",00:09:55.650,00:09:59.460
So it's also exact for cubics.,00:09:59.460,00:10:06.630
"And that's what explains
the fourth order validity.",00:10:06.630,00:10:12.400
"The last thing that
I want to point out",00:10:12.400,00:10:14.900
"is that this is extremely
vague, what I said there.",00:10:14.900,00:10:17.820
"And you should be a little
bit cautious about it.",00:10:17.820,00:10:20.340
"You need to watch out
for 1/x for x near 0.",00:10:20.340,00:10:30.890
"All bets are off if the
function is singular.",00:10:30.890,00:10:34.120
"And there's a lot
of area under there.",00:10:34.120,00:10:36.250
"And it's also true that if
the derivative messes up,",00:10:36.250,00:10:40.740
you're in trouble too.,00:10:40.740,00:10:41.770
"You really need for the function
to be nice and smooth in order",00:10:41.770,00:10:44.480
for Simpson's Rule to work.,00:10:44.480,00:10:46.700
This is wath out.,00:10:46.700,00:10:48.740
"That's a real wath out, but
we'll try to-- Watch out.",00:10:48.740,00:10:55.920
Watch out for whenever x near 0.,00:10:55.920,00:10:58.290
Then this thing doesn't work.,00:10:58.290,00:11:00.770
"This thing really depends
on bounds on derivatives.",00:11:00.770,00:11:03.710
"But I'm going to be
relatively vague about that.",00:11:03.710,00:11:05.780
"I'm not attempting to give
you an error analysis here.",00:11:05.780,00:11:12.780
"OK, so if you were
doing this on an exam,",00:11:12.780,00:11:16.520
"how do you remember this
strange pattern of numbers?",00:11:16.520,00:11:21.600
"The one thing that I want to
recommend to you is, as a way",00:11:21.600,00:11:27.250
"of remembering it, so
the one mnemonic device,",00:11:27.250,00:11:35.620
"we'll call it a
mnemonic device here,",00:11:35.620,00:11:39.340
"for remembering what it
is that you're doing,",00:11:39.340,00:11:42.850
"is to remind yourself of
what happens for the simplest",00:11:42.850,00:11:48.990
possible case.,00:11:48.990,00:11:50.060
Which is f(x) = 1.,00:11:50.060,00:11:53.730
"It seems very modest, but
if it doesn't give you",00:11:53.730,00:11:57.260
"the exact answer
for f(x) = 1, you've",00:11:57.260,00:11:59.410
got the wrong weightings.,00:11:59.410,00:12:02.220
"And here, if you check out what
happens in the first formula",00:12:02.220,00:12:06.120
"here, y_0 / 2 + y_1 +..., well,
we'll go all the way to y_(n-1)",00:12:06.120,00:12:14.110
+ y_n / 2.,00:12:14.110,00:12:14.720
"If you check that
formula out here,",00:12:17.770,00:12:19.450
this is the trapezoidal rule.,00:12:19.450,00:12:21.440
"If you check it out for
this case, then what you get",00:12:21.440,00:12:25.220
"is that this is equal
to delta x times what?",00:12:25.220,00:12:29.050
"Well, all of these are 1's.",00:12:29.050,00:12:30.629
"And how many are
there in the middle?",00:12:30.629,00:12:32.170
"There are n - 1 of
them in the middle.",00:12:32.170,00:12:34.440
So it's 1/2 + n - 1 + 1/2.,00:12:34.440,00:12:38.740
At the tail end.,00:12:38.740,00:12:40.030
So all told it's delta x n.,00:12:40.030,00:12:43.680
"And I remind you that
delta x = b - a / n.",00:12:43.680,00:12:50.980
"So, delta x, this thing,
is equal to b - a.",00:12:50.980,00:12:57.030
And that's just as it should be.,00:12:57.030,00:12:58.930
"What we just calculated is an
approximation to this integral",00:12:58.930,00:13:03.130
here.,00:13:03.130,00:13:04.080
"Which is just the area of
the rectangle of base b -",00:13:04.080,00:13:07.660
a and height 1.,00:13:07.660,00:13:09.210
Which of course is b - a.,00:13:09.210,00:13:12.080
"So this is the check that
you got your weighted average",00:13:12.080,00:13:15.540
correct here.,00:13:15.540,00:13:18.610
"You've put the correct
weightings on everything.",00:13:18.610,00:13:20.880
"And you can do this same
thing with Simpson's Rule.",00:13:20.880,00:13:23.400
And match up those quantities.,00:13:23.400,00:13:31.030
"There was a question in
the room at some point.",00:13:31.030,00:13:36.390
"No, OK.",00:13:36.390,00:13:38.440
"So now, the next thing
I want to do for you",00:13:38.440,00:13:42.680
"is the loose end
which I left hanging.",00:13:42.680,00:13:49.730
"Namely, I want to compute that
mysterious constant square root",00:13:49.730,00:13:55.280
of pi / 2.,00:13:55.280,00:13:56.680
"This is really one of the
most famous computations",00:13:56.680,00:14:00.260
in calculus.,00:14:00.260,00:14:02.420
"And it's a very,
very clever trick.",00:14:02.420,00:14:04.740
"I certainly don't expect you
to come up with this trick.",00:14:04.740,00:14:09.160
"I certainly wouldn't
have myself.",00:14:09.160,00:14:11.360
"But it's an important
thing to calculate.",00:14:11.360,00:14:15.750
And it's just very useful.,00:14:15.750,00:14:17.560
"So I'm going to
tell you about it.",00:14:17.560,00:14:19.310
"And it's just on the subject
that we're dealing with",00:14:19.310,00:14:22.400
"in this unit; namely, slicing.",00:14:22.400,00:14:28.260
Or adding up.,00:14:28.260,00:14:30.400
"So the first step, which is just
something that we already did,",00:14:30.400,00:14:38.850
"was that we found the
volume under this curve.",00:14:38.850,00:14:50.800
"This bell-shaped
curve, e^(-r^2).",00:14:50.800,00:14:54.180
But rotated around an axis.,00:14:54.180,00:15:00.300
Rotated around this axis.,00:15:00.300,00:15:09.020
Around this way.,00:15:09.020,00:15:10.680
So we figured that out.,00:15:10.680,00:15:12.360
"And that was a relatively
short computation.",00:15:12.360,00:15:15.280
"I'm just going to remind
you, it goes by shells.",00:15:15.280,00:15:18.870
"We integrate the whole
range from 0 to infinity.",00:15:18.870,00:15:23.500
"And we have 2 pi r
2 pi r e^(-r^2) dr.",00:15:23.500,00:15:28.530
"So this again is the
circumference of the shell.",00:15:28.530,00:15:30.532
"This is the height of
the shell, and this",00:15:30.532,00:15:32.240
is the thickness of the shell.,00:15:32.240,00:15:34.650
"Circumference,
height, thickness.",00:15:34.650,00:15:45.280
"So we're just taking a little
piece here and sweeping it",00:15:45.280,00:15:47.790
around.,00:15:47.790,00:15:48.520
And then adding up.,00:15:48.520,00:15:52.000
"And then this antiderivative
is pi-- -pi e^(-r^2),",00:15:52.000,00:15:58.250
evaluated at 0 and infinity.,00:15:58.250,00:16:00.420
"And we worked this
out last time.",00:16:00.420,00:16:03.140
This is pi.,00:16:03.140,00:16:06.520
It's pi (1 - 0).,00:16:06.520,00:16:12.700
Which is pi.,00:16:12.700,00:16:13.200
"So the conclusion
is that V = pi.",00:16:13.200,00:16:15.700
We already know that.,00:16:15.700,00:16:20.220
"Now, the problem that
we want to deal with now",00:16:20.220,00:16:22.770
"is the problem not of
a volume, but an area.",00:16:22.770,00:16:31.460
And this looks quite different.,00:16:31.460,00:16:32.990
"And of course the answer
is going to be different.",00:16:32.990,00:16:37.340
But let's do it.,00:16:37.340,00:16:38.250
"So this is this
question mark here.",00:16:38.250,00:16:40.610
"And I'm going to do the one
from minus infinity to infinity.",00:16:40.610,00:16:47.970
"And I'll relate it
to what we talked",00:16:47.970,00:16:50.000
"about earlier in this unit,
in just a couple of minutes",00:16:50.000,00:16:54.210
"when I show you the procedure
that we're going to follow.",00:16:54.210,00:17:00.520
"So here's the
quantity and now, what",00:17:00.520,00:17:02.710
"this is interpreted as is the
area under this bell curve.",00:17:02.710,00:17:07.210
"This time, Q is really an area.",00:17:07.210,00:17:22.950
"Now, what's going to turn
out to happen, is this.",00:17:22.950,00:17:26.370
This is the trick.,00:17:26.370,00:17:27.920
"We're going to compute
V in a different way.",00:17:27.920,00:17:31.480
"And you'll see it laid
out in just a second.",00:17:31.480,00:17:35.920
We will compute V by slices.,00:17:35.920,00:17:42.870
"We're going to slice it
like a piece of bread here.",00:17:42.870,00:17:45.370
"We're going to solve for
that same thing here.",00:17:45.370,00:17:48.640
"And then, amazingly, what's
going to happen is that we will",00:17:48.640,00:17:52.120
discover that V = Q^2.,00:17:52.120,00:17:57.720
"That's going to be
what's going to come out.",00:17:57.720,00:18:03.170
"And that's the end of the
computation that we want.",00:18:03.170,00:18:07.009
"Because actually we
already know what V is.",00:18:07.009,00:18:08.800
"We don't want to read
this equation forward.",00:18:08.800,00:18:11.290
"We want to read
it the other way.",00:18:11.290,00:18:12.890
"We want to say Q^2 = V,
which we already know is pi.",00:18:12.890,00:18:18.310
"And so Q is equal to
the square root of pi.",00:18:18.310,00:18:29.770
"I haven't shown this yet,
this is the weird part.",00:18:29.770,00:18:33.680
"And I'm going to put
it in a little box",00:18:33.680,00:18:35.560
"so that we know that this
is what we need to check.",00:18:35.560,00:18:38.220
We need to check this fact here.,00:18:38.220,00:18:43.070
We haven't done that yet.,00:18:43.070,00:18:45.000
"Now, let me connect this with
what we did a few days ago.",00:18:45.000,00:18:51.500
"With what I called one of
the important functions",00:18:51.500,00:18:54.690
"of mathematics besides
the ones you already know.",00:18:54.690,00:19:02.540
"And so the function
that we were faced with,",00:19:02.540,00:19:04.810
"and that we discussed,
was this one.",00:19:04.810,00:19:15.080
"And then, we were interested
in the value at infinity.",00:19:15.080,00:19:19.380
We were interested in this.,00:19:19.380,00:19:23.780
"Which, if you draw
a picture of it,",00:19:23.780,00:19:26.930
"and you draw the
same bell curve,",00:19:26.930,00:19:29.650
"that's the area
under half. of it.",00:19:29.650,00:19:32.610
"That's the area starting
from 0 and going to infinity.",00:19:32.610,00:19:35.850
That's the area under half.,00:19:35.850,00:19:37.470
So this chunk is F of infinity.,00:19:37.470,00:19:46.270
"And now I hope that this
part of the connection",00:19:46.270,00:19:50.000
is not meant to be fancy.,00:19:50.000,00:19:52.140
"The idea here is that
Q = 2 F(infinity).",00:19:52.140,00:19:58.760
This number here.,00:19:58.760,00:20:00.190
"And so F F(infinity) is equal
to the square root of pi",00:20:00.190,00:20:04.380
"over 2, if we believe what
we said on the last panel.",00:20:04.380,00:20:10.900
"And that was the thing that I
drew a picture of on the board.",00:20:10.900,00:20:14.490
"Namely, the graph of
F looked like this.",00:20:14.490,00:20:18.390
"And there was this
asymptote, which",00:20:18.390,00:20:20.670
"was the limit F(x) tends
to square root of pi",00:20:20.670,00:20:25.020
"over 2, as x goes to infinity.",00:20:25.020,00:20:27.650
That was that limiting value.,00:20:27.650,00:20:30.560
Which is F of infinity.,00:20:30.560,00:20:33.910
So this is the asymptote.,00:20:33.910,00:20:40.460
"And now I've explained
the connection",00:20:40.460,00:20:43.350
"between what we claimed before,
which was quite mysterious,",00:20:43.350,00:20:47.260
"and what we're actually going
to be able to check now.",00:20:47.260,00:20:50.840
"Concretely, by making
this computation.",00:20:50.840,00:21:07.170
"So how in the world can you
get something like this.",00:21:07.170,00:21:09.980
"What's in that orange
box there, that V = Q^2.",00:21:09.980,00:21:14.490
"Again, the technique
is to use slices here.",00:21:14.490,00:21:19.300
"And I'm going to have to
draw you a 3-D picture",00:21:19.300,00:21:21.860
to visualize the slice.,00:21:21.860,00:21:24.970
Let's do that.,00:21:24.970,00:21:27.360
"I'm going to draw
three axes now,",00:21:27.360,00:21:30.520
"because we're now going to be
in three-dimensional space,",00:21:30.520,00:21:33.640
"and I want you to imagine
the x-axis as coming out",00:21:33.640,00:21:37.250
"of the blackboard, the
y-axis is horizontal,",00:21:37.250,00:21:40.320
"and there's a new
axis, which I'll call",00:21:40.320,00:21:41.980
"the z-axis, which is going up.",00:21:41.980,00:21:45.090
"So what's happening
here is that I'm",00:21:45.090,00:21:46.860
"thinking of this-- This is,
if you like, some kind of side",00:21:46.860,00:21:50.810
view.,00:21:50.810,00:21:51.320
"And this is a view where I've
tilted things a little bit",00:21:51.320,00:21:53.653
up to the top.,00:21:53.653,00:21:57.080
"Now, the distribution,
or you could",00:21:57.080,00:21:59.974
"think of this target
in the plane, where",00:21:59.974,00:22:01.640
"the most likely places
to hit were in the middle",00:22:01.640,00:22:04.110
and it died off.,00:22:04.110,00:22:05.510
As we went down.,00:22:05.510,00:22:07.390
"Now, I want to draw a
picture of this graph.",00:22:07.390,00:22:11.400
"I'm going to draw a
picture of e^(-r^2).",00:22:11.400,00:22:15.240
And it's basically a hump.,00:22:15.240,00:22:18.090
"So I'm going to take the
first-- the slice along y = 0.",00:22:18.090,00:22:22.420
The y = 0 slice.,00:22:22.420,00:22:23.880
"And I claim that that
goes up like this.",00:22:23.880,00:22:26.300
And then comes back down.,00:22:26.300,00:22:28.310
"Let me shade this in,
so that you can see",00:22:28.310,00:22:32.100
what kind of a slice this is.,00:22:32.100,00:22:34.140
"This is supposed to be along
this vertical plane here.",00:22:34.140,00:22:38.679
"Which is coming out
of the blackboard",00:22:38.679,00:22:40.220
and coming towards you.,00:22:40.220,00:22:42.409
And that's a slice.,00:22:42.409,00:22:43.200
"Now, I'm going to draw
one more slice so that you",00:22:43.200,00:22:46.630
can see what's happening.,00:22:46.630,00:22:49.000
"I'm going to draw a
slice at another place.",00:22:49.000,00:22:52.310
Along here.,00:22:52.310,00:22:52.860
This will be y = b.,00:22:52.860,00:22:55.030
Some other level.,00:22:55.030,00:22:56.709
"And now I'm going to
show you what happens.",00:22:56.709,00:22:58.500
"What happens is that the
hump dies down a little bit.",00:22:58.500,00:23:02.960
"So the bump is just
a little bit lower.",00:23:02.960,00:23:06.750
"And it's going to look a
little bit the same way.",00:23:06.750,00:23:10.284
"But it's just going
to be a bit smaller.",00:23:10.284,00:23:11.950
So there's another slice here.,00:23:11.950,00:23:15.380
Like that.,00:23:15.380,00:23:16.940
"And I want to give a
name to these slices.",00:23:16.940,00:23:20.890
I'm going to call this A(b).,00:23:20.890,00:23:25.090
"That is, the area
of the b slice.",00:23:25.090,00:23:36.130
Under the surface.,00:23:36.130,00:23:39.790
OK?,00:23:39.790,00:23:41.010
"Yes, question.",00:23:41.010,00:23:41.870
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:23:41.870,00:23:47.256
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, the solid.",00:23:47.256,00:23:48.380
Yeah.,00:23:48.380,00:23:48.890
"We're trying to figure
out this volume here,",00:23:48.890,00:23:52.830
"which is the one we started
out with, by slices.",00:23:52.830,00:23:56.780
"So first I have to think
of-- I'm going to visualize--",00:23:56.780,00:23:59.500
So here I didn't even visualize.,00:23:59.500,00:24:01.970
"I took a cross
section and I thought",00:24:01.970,00:24:03.490
"about how to spin it around
without actually doing that",00:24:03.490,00:24:06.580
in three-dimensional space.,00:24:06.580,00:24:07.954
"But now I'm going to take
a different kind of slice.",00:24:07.954,00:24:10.120
"I'm going to take
that same bump, which",00:24:10.120,00:24:12.260
is a three-dimensional object.,00:24:12.260,00:24:13.680
"I'm going to lay
it down on a plane.",00:24:13.680,00:24:16.050
Which looks like this.,00:24:16.050,00:24:17.540
And then it's a bump here.,00:24:17.540,00:24:20.850
It's a hump.,00:24:20.850,00:24:22.260
"And now I'm going to try to
slice it by various planes.",00:24:22.260,00:24:27.350
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:24:27.350,00:24:29.370
"PROFESSOR: So one
way of defining",00:24:29.370,00:24:34.270
"the bump, as you just suggested,
is you take this curve",00:24:34.270,00:24:37.609
"and you rotate it
around this z-axis.",00:24:37.609,00:24:39.150
"So in other words, you make
this the axis of rotation,",00:24:39.150,00:24:41.400
you spin it around.,00:24:41.400,00:24:43.505
That's correct.,00:24:43.505,00:24:44.130
"So that shows you that the
peaks as you go down here",00:24:44.130,00:24:48.020
"are going to descend
the same way.",00:24:48.020,00:24:50.740
"But I don't want to
draw those lines.",00:24:50.740,00:24:54.140
"I want to imagine what
the parallel slices are.",00:24:54.140,00:24:57.780
"Because I don't want
to get cross slices.",00:24:57.780,00:24:59.610
"I want all slices parallel
to the same thing.",00:24:59.610,00:25:01.950
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:25:01.950,00:25:04.997
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:25:04.997,00:25:05.580
"This is not particularly
easy to visualize.",00:25:05.580,00:25:13.070
"Now, here's the formula
for volume by slices.",00:25:13.070,00:25:17.960
"The formula for volume by
slices is that you add up",00:25:17.960,00:25:23.900
the areas of the slices.,00:25:23.900,00:25:28.770
That's how you do it.,00:25:28.770,00:25:31.050
You take each slice.,00:25:31.050,00:25:32.465
"You add the
cross-sectional area,",00:25:32.465,00:25:33.840
"and then you take a
little thickness, dy,",00:25:33.840,00:25:36.170
and then you add all of them up.,00:25:36.170,00:25:38.330
"Because this is extending
over the whole plane,",00:25:38.330,00:25:40.950
"we're going to have to go all
the way from minus infinity",00:25:40.950,00:25:43.630
to plus infinity.,00:25:43.630,00:25:45.100
"And this is the formula
for volumes by slicing.",00:25:45.100,00:25:56.940
"And now our goal, in order
to do this calculation,",00:25:56.940,00:26:00.300
"we're going to just fix
y is equal to some b.",00:26:00.300,00:26:04.620
"We're just going to fix
one of these slices.",00:26:04.620,00:26:06.840
"And we're going
to calculate A(b).",00:26:06.840,00:26:13.454
"That's what we
need to do in order",00:26:13.454,00:26:14.870
to make this procedure succeed.,00:26:14.870,00:26:23.030
"This is the only place
where this method works.",00:26:23.030,00:26:27.740
But it's an important one.,00:26:27.740,00:26:32.120
"In order to make
it work, I'm going",00:26:32.120,00:26:34.195
"to have to again draw the plot
from a different point of view.",00:26:34.195,00:26:37.760
I'm going to do the top view.,00:26:37.760,00:26:43.550
"So I want to look down
on this x-y plane here.",00:26:43.550,00:26:48.750
"This is the x-direction,
and here's the y-direction.",00:26:48.750,00:26:52.020
"And then again I want
to draw my slice.",00:26:52.020,00:26:56.930
My slice is here.,00:26:56.930,00:27:00.760
At y = b.,00:27:00.760,00:27:04.860
"So we're just
right on top of it.",00:27:04.860,00:27:07.430
"And it's coming up
at some kind of bump.",00:27:07.430,00:27:09.404
"Here, with a little
higher in the middle",00:27:09.404,00:27:11.070
and going down on the sides.,00:27:11.070,00:27:15.970
"Now, the formula for
the height is this.",00:27:15.970,00:27:20.210
"If I take a distance r here,
the formula for the height",00:27:20.210,00:27:25.290
of the bump is e^(-r^2).,00:27:25.290,00:27:27.290
I'll store that over here.,00:27:31.200,00:27:33.390
"e^(-r^2) is the
height at this place.",00:27:33.390,00:27:37.910
"If this distance
to the origin is r.",00:27:37.910,00:27:41.020
That's true all the way around.,00:27:41.020,00:27:43.360
"And in terms of b and x,
we can figure out that",00:27:43.360,00:27:48.622
by this right triangle.,00:27:48.622,00:27:49.580
"This height is b, and
this distance is x.",00:27:49.580,00:27:52.400
So r^2 = b^2 + x^2.,00:27:52.400,00:27:55.940
Question.,00:28:02.060,00:28:02.560
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:28:02.560,00:28:15.350
"PROFESSOR: The question
is, is that the x-y plane.",00:28:15.350,00:28:19.105
"So the answer is that over here
I cleverly used the letter r.",00:28:19.105,00:28:23.280
"I avoided using y's
and z's or anything.",00:28:23.280,00:28:27.010
"And over here, this
is the distance r.",00:28:27.010,00:28:28.970
"And you like, this
is z, going up.",00:28:28.970,00:28:31.650
That's the way to think of it.,00:28:31.650,00:28:33.430
"So that all of the
letters are consistent.",00:28:33.430,00:28:36.180
"So I just avoided
giving it a name.",00:28:36.180,00:28:39.170
"That's good, that's
exactly the point.",00:28:39.170,00:28:41.960
Alright.,00:28:41.960,00:28:43.160
"So now, I claim I have
a formula for r^2.",00:28:43.160,00:28:46.870
And so I can write this down.,00:28:46.870,00:28:48.397
This e^(-b^2 + x^2).,00:28:48.397,00:28:49.230
"But now I'm going to use
the rule of exponents.",00:28:58.620,00:29:01.934
"Which is that this is the same
as e^(-b^2) times e^(-x^2).",00:29:01.934,00:29:04.350
"And that's going to be
the main way in which we",00:29:07.120,00:29:11.330
"use the particular function
that we're dealing with here.",00:29:11.330,00:29:15.590
"That's really the
main step, amazingly.",00:29:15.590,00:29:20.940
"So now I get to
compute what A(b) is.",00:29:20.940,00:29:33.470
A(b) is the area under a curve.,00:29:33.470,00:29:37.960
"So it's going to be, let
me write it over here,",00:29:37.960,00:29:40.300
"A(b) is the area
under this curve here.",00:29:40.300,00:29:47.160
"Which is some constant
times-- so if you imagine,",00:29:47.160,00:29:51.580
call this thing the name c.,00:29:51.580,00:29:53.270
"Under some curve, ce^(-x^2).",00:29:53.270,00:29:57.070
"Where the c is
equal to e^(-b^2).",00:29:57.070,00:29:59.040
That's what our slice is.,00:30:06.380,00:30:07.560
"In fact, it looks
like one of those.",00:30:07.560,00:30:09.060
"It looks like one
of those bumps.",00:30:09.060,00:30:12.970
Here's its formula again.,00:30:12.970,00:30:14.630
"It's the integral from
minus infinity to infinity",00:30:14.630,00:30:17.850
of e^(-b^2) e^(-x^2) dx.,00:30:17.850,00:30:19.500
"We just recopied
what I had up there.",00:30:28.960,00:30:31.560
"And this is the height at
each value of x, with b fixed.",00:30:31.560,00:30:37.430
"And now, so we have
a lot of steps here.",00:30:37.430,00:30:42.630
"But each of them
is very elementary.",00:30:42.630,00:30:44.680
"The first one was just
that law of exponents.",00:30:44.680,00:30:47.380
"That we could split
the two into products.",00:30:47.380,00:30:49.520
"Now I'm going to make that
splitting even further.",00:30:49.520,00:30:51.970
This is a constant.,00:30:51.970,00:30:53.420
It's not varying with x.,00:30:53.420,00:30:55.150
"So I'm going to factor
it out of the integral.",00:30:55.150,00:30:59.060
"This is e^(-b^2) times the
integral from minus infinity",00:30:59.060,00:31:02.230
to infinity of e^(-x^2) dx.,00:31:02.230,00:31:03.850
"So this might look frightening,
but actually it's just",00:31:06.390,00:31:09.890
the property of an integral.,00:31:09.890,00:31:11.110
"All integrals have
this kind of property.",00:31:11.110,00:31:13.180
"You can always factor
out a constant.",00:31:13.180,00:31:17.090
"And now here comes
the remarkable thing.",00:31:17.090,00:31:20.900
"This is e^(-b^2) times a number
which is now familiar to us.",00:31:20.900,00:31:26.920
What is this number?,00:31:26.920,00:31:27.980
This is what we're looking for.,00:31:27.980,00:31:29.280
"This is our unknown, Q.
So I've computed A(b),",00:31:29.280,00:31:40.550
"and now I'm ready to
finish the problem off.",00:31:40.550,00:31:44.260
"A(b) = e^(-b^2) Q. Q is
that strange number which we",00:31:44.260,00:31:48.720
don't know yet.,00:31:48.720,00:31:49.380
What it is.,00:31:49.380,00:31:51.850
"So now I'm going to
compute the whole volume.",00:31:51.850,00:31:55.570
"The whole volume,
remember, it's over there,",00:31:55.570,00:31:57.850
"it's minus infinity
to infinity, A(y) dy.",00:31:57.850,00:32:02.540
"And now I'm just going to plug
in the formula that we've found",00:32:02.540,00:32:05.300
"for A. Now I'm doing
this for each b,",00:32:05.300,00:32:07.860
"so I'm doing it
varying over all b's.",00:32:07.860,00:32:09.740
"So I have the integral from
minus infinity to infinity.",00:32:09.740,00:32:12.710
And here I have e^(-y^2).,00:32:12.710,00:32:15.490
I've replaced b by y.,00:32:15.490,00:32:17.620
And now I have Q. And I have dy.,00:32:17.620,00:32:21.640
"I just recopied what
I had over there",00:32:21.640,00:32:23.970
into the formula for slicing.,00:32:23.970,00:32:27.100
"And now, I'm going to do
this trick of factoring out",00:32:27.100,00:32:29.920
the constant a second time.,00:32:29.920,00:32:32.260
This is a constant.,00:32:32.260,00:32:33.860
It doesn't depend on y.,00:32:33.860,00:32:35.180
"It's the same for all y,
it just will factor out.",00:32:35.180,00:32:38.030
"So this is the same as Q
times the integral from minus",00:32:38.030,00:32:40.880
"infinity to infinity,
e^(-y^2) dy.",00:32:40.880,00:32:47.350
"And now, lo and behold,
this expression here.",00:32:47.350,00:32:52.200
"Of course, notice how
I defined Q. Let's",00:32:52.200,00:32:54.510
"go back carefully to
where Q is defined.",00:32:54.510,00:32:56.950
"Here's Q. This t is
a dummy variable.",00:32:56.950,00:33:02.900
"It doesn't matter
what I call it.",00:33:02.900,00:33:04.370
"I can call it x,
I can call it u,",00:33:04.370,00:33:05.790
"I can call it v.
In this case, I've",00:33:05.790,00:33:07.620
given it two different names.,00:33:07.620,00:33:10.020
"At this stage, I called it x.",00:33:10.020,00:33:13.030
"And at this stage
I'm calling it y.",00:33:13.030,00:33:14.860
But it's the same variable.,00:33:14.860,00:33:17.970
"And so this little chunk is
Q and altogether I have two",00:33:17.970,00:33:20.650
"of them, for Q^2
being the total.",00:33:20.650,00:33:23.320
"And that's the end
of the argument.",00:33:23.320,00:33:32.050
It's a real miracle.,00:33:32.050,00:33:33.010
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:33:33.010,00:33:45.920
PROFESSOR: Great question.,00:33:45.920,00:33:47.580
"The question is, wait a minute.",00:33:47.580,00:33:49.490
"As y changes, doesn't x change.",00:33:49.490,00:33:53.620
"And so then this
wouldn't be a constant.",00:33:53.620,00:33:58.120
"So that's the way in which
we've used the letters x and y",00:33:58.120,00:34:01.740
in this whole course.,00:34:01.740,00:34:04.110
"When you get to 18.02,
you'll almost never do that.",00:34:04.110,00:34:07.710
"Always y and x will be
different variables.",00:34:07.710,00:34:10.807
"And they won't have to
depend on each other.",00:34:10.807,00:34:12.640
"Now, let me show you where on
this picture the x and the y",00:34:12.640,00:34:15.700
are.,00:34:15.700,00:34:17.610
"We've got a whole x-y plane,
and here I'm fixing y = b,",00:34:17.610,00:34:21.000
y isn't varying.,00:34:21.000,00:34:23.220
Whereas x is changing.,00:34:23.220,00:34:25.340
"So, in other words, I don't have
a relationship between x and y,",00:34:25.340,00:34:29.000
unless I fix it.,00:34:29.000,00:34:29.900
"In this case I've decided that
y is going to be constant.",00:34:29.900,00:34:32.690
For all x.,00:34:32.690,00:34:35.400
"Over here, I made a computation.",00:34:35.400,00:34:39.110
"And I have a Q, which
is just a single number.",00:34:39.110,00:34:41.380
"No matter which b I took,
it didn't matter which.",00:34:41.380,00:34:44.830
No matter which y equals b.,00:34:44.830,00:34:46.130
"Of course, I changed
the name to b so it",00:34:46.130,00:34:47.930
wouldn't be so jarring to you.,00:34:47.930,00:34:50.630
"But in fact this
b was y all along.",00:34:50.630,00:34:53.920
"It's just that the x varied
completely independently",00:34:53.920,00:34:57.460
of the y.,00:34:57.460,00:34:57.960
"I could fix the y and vary
the x, I could fix the x",00:34:57.960,00:35:00.300
and vary the y.,00:35:00.300,00:35:03.390
"So it's a different
use of the letters.",00:35:03.390,00:35:06.590
From what you're used to.,00:35:06.590,00:35:07.720
"It happens that y is
not a function of x.",00:35:07.720,00:35:10.360
In this case.,00:35:10.360,00:35:11.171
Yes.,00:35:11.171,00:35:11.670
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:35:11.670,00:35:16.455
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:35:16.455,00:35:17.080
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:35:17.080,00:35:23.030
"PROFESSOR: The question
is, because I'm",00:35:23.030,00:35:25.610
"rotating around the z-axis,
doesn't x change exactly",00:35:25.610,00:35:29.000
as much as y does.,00:35:29.000,00:35:30.210
"What happens is that x and
y are symmetric variables.",00:35:30.210,00:35:33.790
They can be treated equally.,00:35:33.790,00:35:36.870
"But if I decide to take slices
with respect to y being fixed",00:35:36.870,00:35:41.660
"and x varying, then of
course they're now separated,",00:35:41.660,00:35:45.070
"and I have a separate role
for the x and a separate role",00:35:45.070,00:35:47.410
for the y.,00:35:47.410,00:35:48.870
"Or if I'd sliced
it the other way,",00:35:48.870,00:35:50.420
"I would have gotten
the same answer.",00:35:50.420,00:35:51.920
"I just would have reversed
the roles of x and y.",00:35:51.920,00:35:54.560
"So what's happening
is that x and y",00:35:54.560,00:35:56.100
"are on equal footing with
each other in this picture,",00:35:56.100,00:36:01.150
"and I could've
sliced the other way.",00:36:01.150,00:36:02.650
"I would have gotten
the same answer.",00:36:02.650,00:36:04.610
"That's more or less the
answer to your question.",00:36:04.610,00:36:07.660
OK.,00:36:07.660,00:36:13.180
"Now I have given
you a review sheet,",00:36:13.180,00:36:16.300
"and I want to run
through, briefly,",00:36:16.300,00:36:19.150
what's going to be on the exam.,00:36:19.150,00:36:23.390

exam questions is",00:36:23.390,00:36:28.140
what's going to be on the exam.,00:36:28.140,00:36:30.120
"There are, sorry this is
not displayed correctly.",00:36:30.120,00:36:33.390
"So, exam questions,
but now I'm just",00:36:33.390,00:36:35.110
going to show you what they are.,00:36:35.110,00:36:36.490
"There are five
questions on the exam.",00:36:36.490,00:36:38.090
"They are completely parallel
to what you got last year.",00:36:38.090,00:36:46.580
So you should look at that test.,00:36:46.580,00:36:48.100
It's worth looking at.,00:36:48.100,00:36:50.570
"And you'll see in the
descriptions on this sheet",00:36:50.570,00:36:54.750
"that what I'm describing
is what's on that test.",00:36:54.750,00:37:00.410

is - and this is also",00:37:00.410,00:37:04.160
"posted on the Web
- is that you'll",00:37:04.160,00:37:06.790

probability or perhaps work.",00:37:25.510,00:37:29.990
"And sketch a function
which is given",00:37:29.990,00:37:32.410
in this form as an integral.,00:37:32.410,00:37:37.380
"So those are the
questions, and you'll",00:37:37.380,00:37:42.020
"see by the example of last
year's exam exactly the style.",00:37:42.020,00:37:46.080
"They're really going
to be very similar.",00:37:46.080,00:37:48.540
"Yes, question.",00:37:48.540,00:37:49.450
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:37:49.450,00:38:01.582
"PROFESSOR: OK, good question.",00:38:01.582,00:38:02.790
"So the question is,
for Riemann sums,",00:38:02.790,00:38:05.560
"what's the difference
between upper and lower,",00:38:05.560,00:38:08.850
and right and left?,00:38:08.850,00:38:19.750
So here we have a Riemann sum.,00:38:19.750,00:38:25.300
"And I'm going to give
you a picture which is,",00:38:25.300,00:38:29.720
"maybe this function y = 1 /
x, which was the one that we",00:38:29.720,00:38:33.045
were discussing earlier.,00:38:33.045,00:38:37.900
"If you take the
function y = 1 / x",00:38:37.900,00:38:40.420
"and you break it up
into pieces here,",00:38:40.420,00:38:43.540
"however it doesn't
matter how many pieces,",00:38:43.540,00:38:45.370
"let's just say there
are four of them.",00:38:45.370,00:38:48.390
"Then the lower Riemann
sum is the staircase",00:38:48.390,00:38:53.020
which fits underneath.,00:38:53.020,00:38:55.490
"So this one is a picture
of the lower sum.",00:38:55.490,00:39:01.270
It's always less.,00:39:01.270,00:39:03.220
"And in the case of a decreasing
function, it's going to be,",00:39:03.220,00:39:08.960
"so since if you like,
since 1 / x decreases,",00:39:08.960,00:39:19.530
"the lower sum equals
the right sum.",00:39:19.530,00:39:27.710
"You can see that
visually on this picture.",00:39:27.710,00:39:29.980
"The values you're
going to select",00:39:29.980,00:39:32.730
"are going to be the right
ends of the rectangles.",00:39:32.730,00:39:38.360
The upper sum is the left one.,00:39:38.360,00:39:40.980
"Now, if the function
wiggles up and down,",00:39:40.980,00:39:43.340
"then you have to pick
whichever side is appropriate.",00:39:43.340,00:39:45.700
"Or maybe it'll be a
point in the middle,",00:39:45.700,00:39:47.366
"if the maximum is
achieved in the middle.",00:39:47.366,00:39:54.360
"Yeah, another question.",00:39:54.360,00:39:55.370
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:55.370,00:40:02.549
PROFESSOR: Correct.,00:40:02.549,00:40:03.340
"If the function is
increasing, then the lower sum",00:40:03.340,00:40:09.630
is the left sum.,00:40:09.630,00:40:11.170
"So it just exactly
reverses what's here.",00:40:11.170,00:40:13.630
"So this is decreasing,
lower sum is right-hand sum.",00:40:13.630,00:40:17.920
"Increasing, lower
sum is left-hand sum.",00:40:17.920,00:40:24.400
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:40:24.400,00:40:26.135
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:40:26.135,00:40:26.760
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:40:26.760,00:40:44.549
PROFESSOR: Good question.,00:40:44.549,00:40:45.590
"Suppose you're faced
with a function like this",00:40:45.590,00:40:47.570
in this last problem.,00:40:47.570,00:40:48.660
"Which, generally, these
are the trickiest problems.",00:40:48.660,00:40:52.270
"And the question is,
how are you ever going",00:40:52.270,00:40:54.150
"to be able to decide
on an asymptote,",00:40:54.150,00:40:55.790
"even whether there
is an asymptote.",00:40:55.790,00:40:58.110
"And the answer is, you're not.",00:40:58.110,00:41:01.930
"It's going to be
pretty tricky to get",00:41:01.930,00:41:05.211
"keep track of what's happening
as it goes to infinity.",00:41:05.211,00:41:07.460
"We had an example
on the homework",00:41:07.460,00:41:08.960
"where is was
oscillating and it's",00:41:08.960,00:41:10.470
very unclear what's going on.,00:41:10.470,00:41:12.100
"You have to do a very
long analysis for that.",00:41:12.100,00:41:15.100
"So in fact, just don't
worry about that now.",00:41:15.100,00:41:20.892
"At the very end of
the class, we'll",00:41:20.892,00:41:22.350
"talk a little bit
about these asymptotes.",00:41:22.350,00:41:24.180
"And really, the first issue
is whether they exist or not.",00:41:24.180,00:41:27.620
And that's even something.,00:41:27.620,00:41:30.275
"That's a serious question
which we'll address",00:41:30.275,00:41:32.150
at the very end of this course.,00:41:32.150,00:41:33.800
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:41:33.800,00:41:35.680
PROFESSOR: That's right.,00:41:35.680,00:41:36.680
"It's not going to be
anything that complicated.",00:41:36.680,00:41:40.840
Other questions?,00:41:40.840,00:41:42.350
"We we still have a
five whole minutes,",00:41:42.350,00:41:44.100
"and I have an example to give,
if nobody has a question.",00:41:44.100,00:41:50.440
Yeah.,00:41:50.440,00:41:50.940
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:41:50.940,00:41:51.773
"PROFESSOR: The question,
uh, will I tell you",00:41:51.773,00:41:55.710
which one of what to use?,00:41:55.710,00:41:59.410
"STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
PROFESSOR: When",00:41:59.410,00:42:00.910
"I tell you the numeric
approximation is,",00:42:00.910,00:42:02.576
you'll see on the exam.,00:42:02.576,00:42:04.450
The practice exam that you have.,00:42:04.450,00:42:06.450
I will ask you for all three.,00:42:06.450,00:42:09.220
"I will ask you for the Riemann
sum, the trapezoidal rule,",00:42:09.220,00:42:11.620
and the Simpson's rule.,00:42:11.620,00:42:12.660
"I'm guaranteeing you they'll
all three be on the exam.",00:42:12.660,00:42:16.104
"I'm guaranteeing that
every single thing which",00:42:16.104,00:42:18.020
"is on that piece of
paper is on the exam.",00:42:18.020,00:42:20.930
"And you'll see it on the
exam that you've got.",00:42:20.930,00:42:23.865
"It's exactly parallel
to what's there.",00:42:23.865,00:42:27.420
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:42:27.420,00:42:31.341
"PROFESSOR: So with
areas and volume,",00:42:31.341,00:42:32.840
"the question is will I tell
you which method to use.",00:42:32.840,00:42:36.720
So let's discuss that.,00:42:36.720,00:42:48.340
"So with areas and volumes,
there's basically--",00:42:48.340,00:42:58.180
"So this is always
true with areas.",00:42:58.180,00:43:00.170
"And it's true with
volumes of revolution.",00:43:00.170,00:43:07.040
"By the way you should
read this sheet.",00:43:07.040,00:43:08.970
"Not everything that's
on here have I said.",00:43:08.970,00:43:12.740
But you should read it.,00:43:12.740,00:43:15.020
Because it's all relevant.,00:43:15.020,00:43:16.470
"So with volumes of revolution,
you always work your way",00:43:16.470,00:43:19.820
back to some 2-D diagram.,00:43:19.820,00:43:25.600
"So there's some 2-D
diagram which is always--",00:43:25.600,00:43:30.910
"two-dimensional
diagram, which is always",00:43:30.910,00:43:33.090
connected with these problems.,00:43:33.090,00:43:34.960
"I mean, something this hard
is really just too hard",00:43:34.960,00:43:37.960
"to do on an exam, right?",00:43:37.960,00:43:39.080
"I mean, I'm not going to ask
you something this complicated",00:43:39.080,00:43:41.538
on the exam.,00:43:41.538,00:43:42.472
"Because this involves
a three-dimensional",00:43:42.472,00:43:44.180
visualization.,00:43:44.180,00:43:47.200
"But once you're
down to 2-D, you're",00:43:47.200,00:43:50.270
"supposed to be
able to handle it.",00:43:50.270,00:43:52.180
"Now, what's the main issue after
you've got your 2-D diagram?",00:43:52.180,00:43:56.710
"The main issue is, do you
want to integrate with respect",00:43:56.710,00:43:59.990
to dx or dy?,00:43:59.990,00:44:06.950
"And the answer is
that it will depend.",00:44:06.950,00:44:13.850
"And if there's one
that's going to cause",00:44:13.850,00:44:16.810
"you incredible difficulty,
and I feel that you're not",00:44:16.810,00:44:21.310
"able to dodge it, then
I might give you a hint",00:44:21.310,00:44:24.940
"and say you'd better use
shells, or you'd better",00:44:24.940,00:44:27.750
"use disks or washers
or something like that.",00:44:27.750,00:44:31.370
"But if I feel that you're
grown up enough to figure out",00:44:31.370,00:44:34.760
"which one it is, because
one of them is so ridiculous",00:44:34.760,00:44:37.470
"you say forget it, immediately,
after thinking about it.",00:44:37.470,00:44:40.840
Then I won't tell you which one.,00:44:40.840,00:44:43.460
"Because I figure,
in other words,",00:44:43.460,00:44:44.870
"I don't want you
to waste your time.",00:44:44.870,00:44:47.160
"But I'm willing to waste a
minute or two of your time",00:44:47.160,00:44:50.580
on a wild goose chase.,00:44:50.580,00:44:57.420
"So let me give you
an example of this.",00:44:57.420,00:45:01.380
"Suppose you're looking at the
curve y between 0 and x - x^3.",00:45:01.380,00:45:14.670
So this is some kind of lump.,00:45:14.670,00:45:17.380
Like this.,00:45:17.380,00:45:18.460
"It goes from 0 to 1, because the
right-hand side is 0 at 0 and 1",00:45:18.460,00:45:25.080
here.,00:45:25.080,00:45:25.921
It's some kind of thing.,00:45:25.921,00:45:26.920
"And there are these
two possibilities.",00:45:26.920,00:45:29.850
One of them is to do shells.,00:45:29.850,00:45:33.220
"And then, so this is supposed
to be rotated around the y-axis.",00:45:33.220,00:45:41.040
In this case.,00:45:41.040,00:45:45.940
"And the same would apply,
actually, to the area problem.",00:45:45.940,00:45:48.519
"So I'm doing a slightly
more complicated problem.",00:45:48.519,00:45:50.560
"But you could ask for the area
underneath this, and so forth.",00:45:50.560,00:45:53.660
OK.,00:45:53.660,00:45:54.480
"So we can integrate this dx,
or we can integrate this dy.",00:45:54.480,00:45:57.400
"This indicates that
I'm deciding that this",00:45:57.400,00:46:00.130
"is going to be of thickness
dx, and I'm integrating dx.",00:46:00.130,00:46:02.600
"So that's a choice
that I'm making.",00:46:02.600,00:46:04.940
"Now, the minute I
made that choice",00:46:04.940,00:46:07.160
I know that these are shells.,00:46:07.160,00:46:10.000
"Because they sweep around this
way and that makes them shells.",00:46:10.000,00:46:12.980
Cylindrical shells.,00:46:12.980,00:46:15.460
"And if I do that,
the setup is this.",00:46:15.460,00:46:19.210
It's 2 2 pi x (x - x^3) dx.,00:46:19.210,00:46:25.540
"Now, I claim that when
you get to this point,",00:46:25.540,00:46:28.340
you already know you've won.,00:46:28.340,00:46:30.580
"Because this is an easy
integral to calculate.",00:46:30.580,00:46:32.920
So you're done here.,00:46:32.920,00:46:34.640
You're happy.,00:46:34.640,00:46:37.840
"Now, if you happened to say,
oh gee, I hate to do this.",00:46:37.840,00:46:42.930
"I want to do
something clever, you",00:46:42.930,00:46:47.040
"could try to do it
with cutting this way.",00:46:47.040,00:46:54.220
Let's do this.,00:46:54.220,00:46:56.500
"And this would be
the dy thickness.",00:46:56.500,00:47:01.610
"And then when you
sweep this around,",00:47:01.610,00:47:04.760
you get what we call a washer.,00:47:04.760,00:47:10.560
"Which is really just the
difference of two disks.",00:47:10.560,00:47:14.710
"So the shape here is this
thing swung around this axis.",00:47:14.710,00:47:24.560
And it looks like this.,00:47:24.560,00:47:26.110
"So it's going to be the
difference of radii.",00:47:26.110,00:47:29.270
So what's the formula for this?,00:47:29.270,00:47:32.580
"It's some integral of
pi times the right end,",00:47:32.580,00:47:37.070
"which I'll call x_2,
and here the left end,",00:47:37.070,00:47:39.550
which I'll call x_1.,00:47:39.550,00:47:40.720
"So this is pi pi
(x_2^2 - x_1^2) dy.",00:47:40.720,00:47:43.860
"Now, already at this stage,
you think to yourself",00:47:47.800,00:47:50.510
"this is more complicated
than the other method.",00:47:50.510,00:47:54.740
So you've already abandoned it.,00:47:54.740,00:47:56.500
"But I'm just going to go one
step further into this one",00:47:56.500,00:47:59.790
"to see what it is
that's happening.",00:47:59.790,00:48:01.860
"If you try to figure out what
these values x_1 and x_2 are,",00:48:01.860,00:48:08.950
"that corresponds to solving
for x_1 and x_2 in terms of y.",00:48:08.950,00:48:14.740
"So that's the
following equation.",00:48:14.740,00:48:17.200
"x_1 and x_2 solve the
equation that-- the curve, x -",00:48:17.200,00:48:25.590
x^3 is equal y.,00:48:25.590,00:48:32.080
"Now, look at this equation.",00:48:32.080,00:48:33.790
"That's the equation x^3--
sorry, x^3 - x + y, I guess.",00:48:33.790,00:48:42.290
Let's see.,00:48:42.290,00:48:43.320
"Yeah, that's right,
is equal to 0.",00:48:43.320,00:48:46.880
This is a cubic equation.,00:48:46.880,00:48:53.370
"Although there is
a formula for this.",00:48:53.370,00:48:55.060
"You've never been taught the
formula for this equation.",00:48:55.060,00:48:57.351
"So therefore, you
will never, ever",00:48:57.351,00:48:58.920
"be able to get a formula for
x_2 and x_1 as a function of y.",00:48:58.920,00:49:02.560
"And you'll never be able
to compute this one.",00:49:02.560,00:49:05.030
"This is more than just a dead
end, it's like crash, burn,",00:49:05.030,00:49:08.030
"and, you know, self-destruct.",00:49:08.030,00:49:11.300
"So there may be such a
thing, so do the other way.",00:49:11.300,00:49:14.670
"Good luck, folks.",00:49:14.670,00:49:17.490
