omega recitations are going",00:00:30.250,00:00:34.370

"that Patrick has given
us the big picture",00:00:58.110,00:01:00.930

can work the algorithms.",00:01:10.130,00:01:13.810

"The way we use it on
the quiz is we-- well",00:01:34.880,00:01:37.690
this is an old quiz problem.,00:01:37.690,00:01:39.110
It's from last year.,00:01:39.110,00:01:40.040
It tripped up a lot of people.,00:01:40.040,00:01:41.480

go over it today.",00:01:41.480,00:01:43.490

to emphasizing tricks",00:01:47.120,00:01:49.820
"that I've picked up over of
the three years of TA-ing",00:01:49.820,00:01:53.720

that you will not fall prey",00:01:53.720,00:01:56.650

Hopefully.,00:01:58.600,00:01:59.520
"I say hopefully, because
some of these tricks",00:01:59.520,00:02:01.900
"I talked about omega
recitation last year",00:02:01.900,00:02:05.029
"and people still
got tricked by them.",00:02:05.029,00:02:06.570
"I guess maybe some people
didn't come to omega recitation",00:02:06.570,00:02:09.100
"or they were just
very tricky tricks.",00:02:09.100,00:02:11.820
"So be sure to come
to omega recitation.",00:02:11.820,00:02:14.040

these things are solved.",00:02:18.110,00:02:20.130

you're not sure.",00:02:20.130,00:02:23.220

that everyone's",00:02:25.010,00:02:27.350
"going to do really well on the
rules part of the first quiz.",00:02:27.350,00:02:31.820
"So without further
ado, if there are",00:02:31.820,00:02:35.510
"no questions on that, which
I don't think there probably",00:02:35.510,00:02:38.730
"will be, let's move on
to the problem at hand.",00:02:38.730,00:02:42.260
"As some of you may
have noticed, it",00:02:42.260,00:02:43.980
is a Harry Potter based problem.,00:02:43.980,00:02:45.520
"One of our TAs last year
was a big Harry Potter fan.",00:02:45.520,00:02:49.430
"So what we have here
a series of rules",00:02:49.430,00:02:53.290
and a series of assertions.,00:02:53.290,00:02:55.740
"Now if you happen to be real go
getter and have already looked",00:02:55.740,00:02:59.850
"at all the past
quizzes online, you",00:02:59.850,00:03:01.610
"may have already
seen this problem.",00:03:01.610,00:03:03.640
"And if you really, really
have attention to detail",00:03:03.640,00:03:06.310
"you may notice something a
little bit different in the way",00:03:06.310,00:03:08.740
"I wrote it as compared to the
way it was written online.",00:03:08.740,00:03:11.700
"In fact, you may, if you
have a lot of times a detail,",00:03:11.700,00:03:15.140
"but you're not really
in on Scheme or LISP,",00:03:15.140,00:03:17.710
"you may think the way I wrote
it is much easier to understand.",00:03:17.710,00:03:21.680
"And in case you can't
understand the other way,",00:03:21.680,00:03:24.260
"and in case one
of the TAs decides",00:03:24.260,00:03:26.440
"to write it in a LISP-like
way again, let me explain.",00:03:26.440,00:03:29.900
"If you look at one of my
rules, say if x is ambitious,",00:03:29.900,00:03:34.270
"and x is a squib,
then x has a bad term.",00:03:34.270,00:03:36.880
That's rule 0 up at the top.,00:03:36.880,00:03:40.530
"That's written in sort of what
we call in fixed notation.",00:03:40.530,00:03:44.270
"It's easy, it's simple.",00:03:44.270,00:03:45.610
"All operators are in the
order you would expect.",00:03:45.610,00:03:48.160
2 plus 3 equals 5.,00:03:48.160,00:03:50.950
"There's another kind of
notation that is sometimes",00:03:50.950,00:03:53.220
used on previous quizzes.,00:03:53.220,00:03:54.630
"And by sometimes, good
number of times, actually.",00:03:54.630,00:03:57.720
"I'm not sure why we still use
it that way, because of the fact",00:03:57.720,00:04:00.420
"that the class has move on to
Python, but we do, sometimes.",00:04:00.420,00:04:03.810
"And that's called
prefix notation.",00:04:03.810,00:04:05.480
"In prefix notation, the
operator comes first.",00:04:05.480,00:04:08.510
"So for instance,
plus 2 3 equals 5.",00:04:08.510,00:04:13.580
The plus comes first.,00:04:13.580,00:04:14.547
"The function, then, comes first.",00:04:14.547,00:04:15.880
"In this case, the
function is plus.",00:04:15.880,00:04:18.050
"So if we were writing this
in prefix notation, in fact,",00:04:18.050,00:04:20.680
"the way I received it, when it
said, ""if and x is ambitious,",00:04:20.680,00:04:26.150
"x is a squib, then
x has a bad term.",00:04:26.150,00:04:28.760
"The and went first and
there's a parentheses",00:04:28.760,00:04:31.620
"which included everything
that was scoped under the and.",00:04:31.620,00:04:35.144
"Does anyone have any questions
about prefix notation",00:04:35.144,00:04:37.310
in case it comes up?,00:04:37.310,00:04:39.640
"Just remember, if things
start being written",00:04:39.640,00:04:43.160
"in a really weird way
with lots and lots",00:04:43.160,00:04:45.270
"and lots of
parentheses, whatever's",00:04:45.270,00:04:47.740
"outside the parentheses,
whether it be ""plus"" or ""and""",00:04:47.740,00:04:50.705
"or ""or"" is an operator that acts
on the things that are inside.",00:04:50.705,00:04:55.192
"However, we're not going
to deal with that now,",00:04:55.192,00:04:57.150
"because I think the
most important thing is",00:04:57.150,00:05:00.050
"to understand is the rules,
and the less important thing",00:05:00.050,00:05:02.930
"is to understand
prefix notation.",00:05:02.930,00:05:05.030
"And you can do a
problem at home that's",00:05:05.030,00:05:07.100
"written in prefix notation
to test yourself on that.",00:05:07.100,00:05:10.570
So what rules do we have here.,00:05:10.570,00:05:13.270
We've got equals 0 through 5.,00:05:13.270,00:05:15.510
"For some reason they
are labeled with P's.",00:05:15.510,00:05:18.720
"They are often labeled
with either P's or R's.",00:05:18.720,00:05:21.420
"The secret on why they are
labelled with P's is that one",00:05:21.420,00:05:24.930
"year somebody labeled them
with P's for like ""proposition""",00:05:24.930,00:05:28.062
or something like that.,00:05:28.062,00:05:29.020
"And then other TAs looked at
that test and sometimes also",00:05:29.020,00:05:32.410
"labeled it with P's and it
sort of down the line continued",00:05:32.410,00:05:36.320
"to be labeled with P's,
and sometimes with R's.",00:05:36.320,00:05:40.050
"So these P's are
these six rules.",00:05:40.050,00:05:42.500
"The first rule is if x is
ambitious, and x is a squib,",00:05:42.500,00:05:46.820
then x has a bad term.,00:05:46.820,00:05:49.090
"So what's the deal with
these question mark x's?",00:05:49.090,00:05:51.860
"The question mark before an
x, or perhaps a y down here,",00:05:51.860,00:05:55.800
"indicate that there's a
variable waiting to be bound.",00:05:55.800,00:05:59.340
"We're not assuming there's a
Harry Potter character named",00:05:59.340,00:06:01.920
"x, and only if that question
mark x, the mystery character,",00:06:01.920,00:06:05.130
"only if mystery x character
is ambitious can that person",00:06:05.130,00:06:09.220
possibly have a bad term.,00:06:09.220,00:06:10.710
"What we're seeing is any
character in the Harry Potter",00:06:10.710,00:06:13.470
"universe, or not
the Harry Potter",00:06:13.470,00:06:15.240
"universe, maybe a rhinoceros,
can fit into that x.",00:06:15.240,00:06:20.520
"So for instance, if a
rhinoceros is ambitious,",00:06:20.520,00:06:22.850
"and a rhinoceros is a squib,
then a rhinoceros has bad term.",00:06:22.850,00:06:26.920
"That rule saying, for
any x this is true.",00:06:26.920,00:06:31.250
"And it's very important how
we treat the question mark",00:06:31.250,00:06:33.950
"x, and how we bind
question mark x,",00:06:33.950,00:06:37.620
"when we do both back chaining
and forward chaining.",00:06:37.620,00:06:40.540
"I'll get back to that, because
some people made some very,",00:06:40.540,00:06:44.820
"very small mistakes
that really messed up",00:06:44.820,00:06:48.720
"a lot of their forward and
backward chaining last year.",00:06:48.720,00:06:51.130
It was actually very tricky.,00:06:51.130,00:06:52.296
"Jeremy, the TA who wrote
this was very clever,",00:06:52.296,00:06:56.240
"and it makes it really great
case study for you guys.",00:06:56.240,00:06:59.500
"All right, so Rule 1, if x
lives in Gryffindor tower",00:06:59.500,00:07:03.125
then x is a protagonist.,00:07:03.125,00:07:05.140
"By the way, for
conciseness I'm going",00:07:05.140,00:07:06.750
"to be using GT for
Gryffindor tower",00:07:06.750,00:07:09.390
"when I write these
in later on, and I'll",00:07:09.390,00:07:11.530
use SD for Slytherin dungeon.,00:07:11.530,00:07:13.920
"Speaking of which, Rule 2, if
x lives in Slytherin dungeon,",00:07:13.920,00:07:17.460
"then x is a villain,
x is ambitious.",00:07:17.460,00:07:21.960
Why there are two things here?,00:07:21.960,00:07:24.040
"Well, after the ""if"" we have
what we call antecedent,",00:07:24.040,00:07:27.570
"that's something that needs to
be true in order for this rule",00:07:27.570,00:07:30.580
to match.,00:07:30.580,00:07:32.030
"After the ""then"" we have what
is called the consequent,",00:07:32.030,00:07:35.600
"and in this case there
are two consequents.",00:07:35.600,00:07:37.509
"Anyone who lives in
Slytherin dungeon",00:07:37.509,00:07:39.050
"is automatically a villain
and also ambitious.",00:07:39.050,00:07:42.440
"So you can think of there
being sort of an ""and",00:07:42.440,00:07:45.330
"therefore"" for the purposes
of both of those assertions",00:07:45.330,00:07:49.730
"would be added to
the knowledge base.",00:07:49.730,00:07:52.520
"Rule 3, if x is the
protagonist or x is a villain,",00:07:52.520,00:07:56.320
"and x is ambitious,
then x studies a lot.",00:07:56.320,00:08:02.730
"By the way, the scope
for this, just to be sure",00:08:02.730,00:08:09.440
"that we're clear, is this.",00:08:09.440,00:08:14.610
"So we need them to
be a protagonist",00:08:14.610,00:08:18.470
"or villain and no matter what
they have to be ambitious.",00:08:18.470,00:08:22.930
"Rule 4, if x studies a lot,
and x is a protagonist,",00:08:22.930,00:08:26.460
x becomes Hermione's friend.,00:08:26.460,00:08:28.540
"And Rule 5, if x snogs y, and x
lives in Gryffindor tower and y",00:08:28.540,00:08:33.950
"lives in Slytherin dungeon,
then x has a bad term.",00:08:33.950,00:08:38.130
"So those are our
six rules that we",00:08:38.130,00:08:39.760
"can use to understand Jeremy's
world of the Harry Potter",00:08:39.760,00:08:42.330
universe.,00:08:42.330,00:08:43.730
"And we also start off
with four assertions.",00:08:43.730,00:08:47.060
"Let me not underestimate
the value of always looking",00:08:47.060,00:08:50.210
to the assertions.,00:08:50.210,00:08:50.960
"It's one of my white star ideas
that are up here on the board.",00:08:50.960,00:08:55.180
Let me see.,00:08:55.180,00:08:56.740
This.,00:08:56.740,00:08:57.240
Perfect.,00:08:57.240,00:08:59.270
"Always check the assertions
before using a rule.",00:08:59.270,00:09:02.640
"This really tripped people up
last year, and you'll see why,",00:09:02.640,00:09:05.260
"because we're doing
last year's problem.",00:09:05.260,00:09:08.734
"Our four assertions
that we start.",00:09:08.734,00:09:10.150
"With assertion 0, Millicent
lives in Slytherin dungeon.",00:09:10.150,00:09:14.200
"Assertion 1, Millicent
is ambitious.",00:09:14.200,00:09:16.980
"Assertion 1 is what
tripped people up,",00:09:16.980,00:09:18.580
"so remember that
Millicent is ambitious.",00:09:18.580,00:09:20.820
"Assertion 2 Seamus lives
in Gryffindor tower.",00:09:20.820,00:09:23.690
"And assertion 3,
Seamus snogs Millicent.",00:09:23.690,00:09:27.380
"So those those are
our four assertions",00:09:27.380,00:09:30.010
that we've already started with.,00:09:30.010,00:09:32.820
"Now the two things we're
going to have to do",00:09:32.820,00:09:35.020
"are backward chaining
and forward chaining.",00:09:35.020,00:09:38.400
"Now when you guys learned
these two backward chaining",00:09:38.400,00:09:41.657
"and forward chaining,
raise your hand",00:09:41.657,00:09:43.840
"if thought forward chaining was
harder than backward chaining.",00:09:43.840,00:09:46.500
I knew it!,00:09:50.470,00:09:51.032
"I can prove whatever
point I want because noone",00:09:51.032,00:09:52.990
wants the raise their hand.,00:09:52.990,00:09:54.320
"I also think backward chaining
is higher than forward",00:09:54.320,00:09:56.710
chaining.,00:09:56.710,00:09:57.210
"Raise your hand if you
think backward chaining is",00:09:57.210,00:09:59.251
higher than forward chaining?,00:09:59.251,00:10:00.680
"First of all, we have a
good number of people.",00:10:00.680,00:10:02.190
"Second of all, since no one
wants to raise their hand,",00:10:02.190,00:10:04.580
"I could just ask
it the other way.",00:10:04.580,00:10:06.050
"That's a pro tip if you're ever
with a large group of people.",00:10:06.050,00:10:09.510
"You can prove any point you want
by asking the other direction.",00:10:09.510,00:10:12.680
No one will raise their hand.,00:10:12.680,00:10:14.100
"So I agree that backward
chaining is higher than forward",00:10:14.100,00:10:18.370
chaining.,00:10:18.370,00:10:18.970
"And I disagree with Patrick that
we're going to get out early,",00:10:18.970,00:10:22.680
"so let's start with
backward chaining first.",00:10:22.680,00:10:25.169
"So that we make sure that we
spend the bulk of our time",00:10:25.169,00:10:27.460
with it.,00:10:27.460,00:10:27.959
"The forward chaining,
well, you just",00:10:27.959,00:10:31.580
"go through pretty methodically
and add new rules.",00:10:31.580,00:10:33.710
"Backward chaining, you have
to draw this crazy tree.",00:10:33.710,00:10:36.660
"There's a lot of places to get
lost in the middle of the road.",00:10:36.660,00:10:39.880
"So let's do some
backward chaining.",00:10:39.880,00:10:42.220
"And to do that, I'll do it
over here on the left side.",00:10:42.220,00:10:45.540
"So when we're doing
backward chaining,",00:10:45.540,00:10:47.880
"we have to remember a few
things that are written directly",00:10:47.880,00:10:50.470
on the quiz.,00:10:50.470,00:10:51.140
"So you're not going to
have to worry about that.",00:10:51.140,00:10:53.140
"But they're still
pretty important.",00:10:53.140,00:10:55.290
"So-- actually, I'll
write it on here first.",00:10:55.290,00:10:59.460
I'm going to read them off.,00:10:59.460,00:11:01.470
"So when working on a
hypothesis, the backward chainer",00:11:01.470,00:11:03.850
"tries to find a
matching assertion",00:11:03.850,00:11:05.510
in the list of assertions first.,00:11:05.510,00:11:08.050
"If no matching
assertion is found,",00:11:08.050,00:11:10.850
"the backward chainer
will try to find a rule",00:11:10.850,00:11:13.880
with a matching consequence.,00:11:13.880,00:11:15.250
"A rule that has something
in the then that",00:11:15.250,00:11:17.460
"can prove the assertion
is trying to figure out.",00:11:17.460,00:11:20.220
"So for instance, if
I was doing backward",00:11:20.220,00:11:21.920
"chaining on Seamus [? Snaus ?]
Millicent, what happens?",00:11:21.920,00:11:27.140
"I'm immediately
done because there's",00:11:27.140,00:11:28.960
"an assertion that's
assertion three that says",00:11:28.960,00:11:31.680
Seamus [? Snaus ?] Millicent.,00:11:31.680,00:11:33.280
I proved it.,00:11:33.280,00:11:34.180
I'm done.,00:11:34.180,00:11:34.920
I'm happy.,00:11:34.920,00:11:35.530
"We can leave, we can go home.",00:11:35.530,00:11:37.240
"Unfortunately, that's not
what the quiz asks us to do.",00:11:37.240,00:11:40.380
"Now, let's say that instead,
we were supposed to say,",00:11:40.380,00:11:44.080
"I don't know, Seamus
is a protagonist.",00:11:44.080,00:11:46.850
"Well then, we'd wind
up looking through here",00:11:46.850,00:11:49.890
"and we would look at the
fact that rule one can prove",00:11:49.890,00:11:54.170
that someone is a protagonist.,00:11:54.170,00:11:56.150
"And we'd curse and
try to prove whatever",00:11:56.150,00:11:58.490
"is in the antecedent of rule
one, which is, OK, well,",00:11:58.490,00:12:01.650
"does he live in
Gryffinder Tower?",00:12:01.650,00:12:04.360
"Assertion two, he does.",00:12:04.360,00:12:06.420
So that's some really quick.,00:12:06.420,00:12:07.621
"And if that was too,
fast don't worry.",00:12:07.967,00:12:09.550
"We're going to go step by
step with the actual problem.",00:12:09.550,00:12:12.360
"But I just wanted to give two
really easy problems, really",00:12:12.360,00:12:15.826
"quickly, how it's
going to do it.",00:12:15.826,00:12:17.200
"Let's go step by step
with the real problem.",00:12:17.200,00:12:19.730
"Let's keep in mind,
backward chainer",00:12:19.730,00:12:21.230
"never adds new assertions
to the list of assertions.",00:12:21.230,00:12:24.360
"And if you have a
tiebreak, you always",00:12:24.360,00:12:29.470
"order based on rule order
first, P0 through P5.",00:12:29.470,00:12:34.080
"And if the same rule matches
with more than one thing",00:12:34.080,00:12:39.130
"in your list
assertions, then you",00:12:39.130,00:12:41.030
"tiebreak based on the
order of the assertions.",00:12:41.030,00:12:44.860
Very important.,00:12:44.860,00:12:46.200
"Disambiguation and
tie-breaking are a big place",00:12:46.200,00:12:49.560
to get messed up.,00:12:49.560,00:12:51.970
"So we're going to try
to prove that Millicent",00:12:51.970,00:12:56.330
becomes Hermione's friend.,00:12:56.330,00:12:59.490
"And so I'm going to
abbreviate some of the things,",00:12:59.490,00:13:04.110
but not for the very first line.,00:13:04.110,00:13:06.750
"So Millicent becomes
Hermione's friend.",00:13:06.750,00:13:13.360
We start drawing a goal tree.,00:13:13.360,00:13:15.990
"Now you guys are going to learn
exactly what these mean very",00:13:15.990,00:13:21.580
"soon, in fact, next lecture.",00:13:21.580,00:13:25.370
"But for now, trust me when I
say these goal trees are depth",00:13:25.370,00:13:29.620
first.,00:13:29.620,00:13:31.120
"And I'll explain what that
means because some people have",00:13:31.120,00:13:34.150
"messed themselves up and spent
more time than they needed to",00:13:34.150,00:13:37.070
"by treating the goal
tree in a different way.",00:13:37.070,00:13:41.190
"Now, Millicent becomes
Hermione's friend.",00:13:41.190,00:13:43.950
"Let's pretend that we
are the backward chainer.",00:13:43.950,00:13:46.110
"We're trying to prove that
this is true or disprove",00:13:46.110,00:13:48.640
"and say, well, it's definitely
not true with what we have.",00:13:48.640,00:13:51.470
So let's see.,00:13:51.470,00:13:54.290
"I'm now going to
make you guys help.",00:13:54.290,00:13:56.260
"And people in the back think
they won't be called on.",00:13:56.260,00:13:58.560
"So I often like to call
on people in the back.",00:13:58.560,00:14:00.160
"What do you think is the
first thing we should do?",00:14:00.160,00:14:02.380
Very first thing?,00:14:02.380,00:14:04.070
"Yes, look for a
matching assertion.",00:14:04.070,00:14:05.820
Excellent.,00:14:05.820,00:14:07.020
"Do we have a matching
assertion, everyone?",00:14:07.020,00:14:10.030
"No, we don't.",00:14:10.030,00:14:10.860
"That would be the world's
easiest quiz problem.",00:14:10.860,00:14:13.220
"We do not have a
matching assertion.",00:14:13.220,00:14:14.790
Great.,00:14:14.790,00:14:15.600
"So, since we don't have a
matching assertion, what now?",00:14:15.600,00:14:20.470
"AUDIENCE: We start
to look at the rules.",00:14:20.470,00:14:23.565
MARK SEIFTER: That's right.,00:14:23.565,00:14:24.690
"And do you see any rule that
could prove that Millicent",00:14:24.690,00:14:29.060
becomes Hermione's friend?,00:14:29.060,00:14:30.220
AUDIENCE: P4.,00:14:30.220,00:14:31.245
MARK SEIFTER: That's right.,00:14:31.245,00:14:32.370
"You can see in P4, x,
which can be anybody.",00:14:32.370,00:14:35.520
"Anyone is capable of
being Hermione's friend.",00:14:35.520,00:14:38.620
Great.,00:14:38.620,00:14:39.310
So P4 is our rule of the hour.,00:14:39.310,00:14:44.210
So we're going to use P4.,00:14:44.210,00:14:47.300
"And when we use P4 to prove that
Millicent becomes Hermione's",00:14:47.300,00:14:52.760
"friend, we're going to
have to add something",00:14:52.760,00:14:55.330
or another to the goal tree.,00:14:55.330,00:14:56.720
So let's see.,00:14:56.720,00:14:57.824
"What do we have to
add to the goal tree?",00:14:57.824,00:14:59.490
"AUDIENCE: We have
to see if Millicent",00:15:01.760,00:15:03.301
studies a lot [INAUDIBLE].,00:15:03.301,00:15:04.385
MARK SEIFTER: That's right.,00:15:04.385,00:15:05.509
Does everyone see that?,00:15:05.509,00:15:06.470
"In order for her to
become Hermione's friend,",00:15:06.470,00:15:08.350
"by rule four, we have to
see if she studies a lot",00:15:08.350,00:15:10.676
and is a protagonist.,00:15:10.676,00:15:11.550
Question?,00:15:11.550,00:15:12.373
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:15:12.373,00:15:13.248
"MARK SEIFTER: OK, that's
a very good question.",00:15:18.400,00:15:20.830
"You're going to get screwed up
if you look at the antecedent",00:15:20.830,00:15:23.330
in backward chaining first.,00:15:23.330,00:15:25.190
"It's backwards
partially for a reason.",00:15:25.190,00:15:27.170
"You need to look
at the consequent.",00:15:27.170,00:15:28.950
Now why is that?,00:15:28.950,00:15:30.040
"Well, let's say there
is a rule six that",00:15:30.040,00:15:32.550
"said if x becomes
Hermione's friend,",00:15:32.550,00:15:37.310
"then Hermione feeds x Polyjuice
Potion, or something like that.",00:15:37.310,00:15:43.090
"Will that rule help
us in back chaining",00:15:43.090,00:15:45.150
"to figure out if Millicent
becomes Hermione's friend?",00:15:45.150,00:15:49.072
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:15:49.072,00:15:51.229
"MARK SEIFTER: Some people
are shaking their head.",00:15:51.229,00:15:53.270
"But think about it, will that
rule be able to prove it?",00:15:53.270,00:15:55.760
No.,00:15:55.760,00:15:56.280
"Now, if they do become
Hermione's friend",00:15:56.280,00:15:58.120
"and we want to do
some forward chaining,",00:15:58.120,00:15:59.300
"we'll figure out
that they're going",00:15:59.300,00:16:00.758
"to transmute into some
kind of other thing because",00:16:00.758,00:16:03.240
of the Polyjuice Potion.,00:16:03.240,00:16:04.240
"But it's not going
to help us do the one",00:16:04.240,00:16:06.040
"thing we want to
back chain, which is",00:16:06.040,00:16:07.581
to prove that thing on the top.,00:16:07.581,00:16:08.912
"So we actually need
to look for something",00:16:08.912,00:16:10.620
"that has our current
goal in its consequent.",00:16:10.620,00:16:13.110
Then we add on the antecedents.,00:16:13.110,00:16:14.640
"As people I've asked
so far-- sorry, I",00:16:14.640,00:16:17.430
"don't know your
names-- like Patrick,",00:16:17.430,00:16:19.110
"have correctly given me every
time, which is excellent.",00:16:19.110,00:16:22.700
"So notice also
that she didn't say",00:16:22.700,00:16:26.400
"x studies a lot needs to
be added to the goal tree.",00:16:26.400,00:16:28.955
"She said Millicent
studies a lot.",00:16:28.955,00:16:31.195
"Oh, another question.",00:16:31.195,00:16:32.290
Great.,00:16:32.290,00:16:34.410
"AUDIENCE: So obviously
after putting rule 4 there,",00:16:34.410,00:16:38.200
"shouldn't we first check
the assertions-- check",00:16:38.200,00:16:41.837
"on the assertions instead of
our conditions [INAUDIBLE]",00:16:41.837,00:16:44.405
"MARK SEIFTER: So
the question is,",00:16:47.000,00:16:48.540
"once we put rule
four in there, should",00:16:48.540,00:16:50.700
"we check to see if those
antecedents of rule four",00:16:50.700,00:16:52.885
"are already in the assertions
before checking other rules?",00:16:52.885,00:16:57.110
The answer?,00:16:57.110,00:16:58.100
"You're not only correct, sir,
you're exactly one step ahead.",00:16:58.100,00:17:01.110
"So I'm going to assume I called
on you for the very next thing.",00:17:01.110,00:17:04.010
"That's exactly what we do
once we draw it onto the tree.",00:17:04.010,00:17:07.770
You're exactly on the way.,00:17:07.770,00:17:10.000
Further question?,00:17:10.000,00:17:12.099
Perfect.,00:17:12.099,00:17:14.130
"All right, great.",00:17:14.130,00:17:16.760
"So again, we're putting up
Millicent studies a lot.",00:17:16.760,00:17:19.994
Millicent is a protagonist.,00:17:19.994,00:17:21.119
We're not putting up x.,00:17:21.119,00:17:23.530
Some people did that.,00:17:23.530,00:17:25.190
"And of course it's an
n node as we heard.",00:17:25.190,00:17:28.200
"We need them both to be
true or we're not going",00:17:28.200,00:17:30.970
to be able to continue onward.,00:17:30.970,00:17:32.300
"So we have-- I'm going
to use m for Millicent.",00:17:32.300,00:17:35.860
Millicent studies a lot.,00:17:35.860,00:17:39.580
"Also over here, Millicent
is a protagonist.",00:17:39.580,00:17:44.680
"And we've already
heard that we need",00:17:49.361,00:17:51.860
"to search in the
assertions before we",00:17:51.860,00:17:54.430
"go into any rules for what
we're looking for next.",00:17:54.430,00:17:58.315
"The question is, what are we
looking for next and in what",00:17:58.315,00:18:00.690
order?,00:18:00.690,00:18:01.290
"This is where that thing I
told you about depth search",00:18:01.290,00:18:03.540
is crucial.,00:18:03.540,00:18:04.860
"We are going to look
here on the left node.",00:18:04.860,00:18:06.944
"And if it has any children,
if we have to keep going down,",00:18:06.944,00:18:09.360
"we are not going
to look here yet.",00:18:09.360,00:18:13.470
There's a few reasons for that.,00:18:13.470,00:18:14.810
One of which is that we're lazy.,00:18:14.810,00:18:16.200
"The evaluation, if
you learned about it,",00:18:16.200,00:18:18.290
"is also-- if you learn about
lazy evaluation, is also lazy.",00:18:18.290,00:18:21.350
"And if we can disprove
this study's a lot branch,",00:18:21.350,00:18:23.845
"we don't have to do any work
with the protagonist branch.",00:18:23.845,00:18:26.220
We're done.,00:18:26.220,00:18:26.720
We're out of here.,00:18:26.720,00:18:28.110
And it's a loss.,00:18:28.110,00:18:31.270
"So we're going to move down
the study's a lot branch.",00:18:31.270,00:18:34.460
"And we already heard
from the audience,",00:18:34.460,00:18:36.360
"we need to look to see if
it's in the assertions.",00:18:36.360,00:18:39.250
"Everyone, is Millicent studies
a lot in the assertions?",00:18:39.250,00:18:43.020
"No, it's not.",00:18:43.020,00:18:45.430
"Well then, now we're going
to get to that question",00:18:45.430,00:18:48.560
"that I had before about the
antecedent or the consequent.",00:18:48.560,00:18:52.000
"Because study lies here in
the antecedent of rule four,",00:18:52.000,00:18:55.192
"but we're not going to be
able to use rule four here.",00:18:55.192,00:18:57.400
"In fact, that's how we got
here in the first place.",00:18:57.400,00:18:59.920
"So the question is--
let's see, the question",00:18:59.920,00:19:05.950
"is, do we have a rule in
the consequent that matches",00:19:05.950,00:19:12.360
Millicent studies a lot.,00:19:12.360,00:19:14.952
"Yeah, that's right, P3.",00:19:14.952,00:19:15.910
That's right.,00:19:19.030,00:19:19.730
"So P3 would give us
Millicent studies a lot.",00:19:19.730,00:19:23.280
"And so therefore what will
we add to the goal tree?",00:19:23.280,00:19:28.180
"AUDIENCE: We add both that is
Millicent either a protagonist",00:19:28.180,00:19:31.655
or a villain and [INAUDIBLE].,00:19:31.655,00:19:33.150
"MARK SEIFTER: Yeah, she.",00:19:33.150,00:19:34.920
Turns out to be a girl.,00:19:34.920,00:19:37.950
So that's exactly right.,00:19:37.950,00:19:39.900
"We heard that we
need to add-- we",00:19:39.900,00:19:42.920
"need to add an AND node,
which also has an OR",00:19:42.920,00:19:46.845
"node at the bottom
of it, because this",00:19:46.845,00:19:48.480
"is a little bit of
a complicated rule.",00:19:48.480,00:19:50.650
So we have an AND node.,00:19:50.650,00:19:54.380
So we have an AND node.,00:19:54.380,00:19:55.980
"And the first thing
on the AND node",00:19:55.980,00:19:57.630
"is Millicent is a protagonist
or Millicent is a villain.",00:19:57.630,00:20:08.230
"And the second thing on the AND
node is Millicent is ambitious.",00:20:12.240,00:20:16.105
"Actually, that is the second
thing on the AND node.",00:20:19.525,00:20:21.650
I hope that's what I said.,00:20:21.650,00:20:23.390
"All right, the second
thing on the AND node",00:20:23.390,00:20:24.525
is Millicent is ambitious.,00:20:24.525,00:20:25.608
So here's our handy little tree.,00:20:29.160,00:20:37.657
"Now this is where it's
important, as I said,",00:20:37.657,00:20:39.490
"we're doing a
depth first search.",00:20:39.490,00:20:41.850
"We're going down
along the left branch.",00:20:41.850,00:20:44.490
"So where do you think we're
going to go next on this tree?",00:20:44.490,00:20:50.885
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:20:50.885,00:20:53.350
MARK SEIFTER: Not quite.,00:20:53.350,00:20:55.467
That's a good guess.,00:20:55.467,00:20:56.300
"You didn't say we're
trying to prove",00:20:56.300,00:20:57.760
"m is a protagonist on
the right branch, which",00:20:57.760,00:20:59.220
is a very common mistake.,00:20:59.220,00:21:00.261
What do you do?,00:21:00.261,00:21:01.376
"AUDIENCE: You should
go down to see",00:21:01.376,00:21:02.834
"if there's a
consequence for m is--",00:21:02.834,00:21:05.410
Millicent is a protagonist.,00:21:05.410,00:21:06.870
"MARK SEIFTER: Which one
of the two Millicent",00:21:06.870,00:21:08.210
"is a protagonist do
we want to look at?",00:21:08.210,00:21:09.835
"Yeah, the farthest down left.",00:21:12.232,00:21:13.440
That's right.,00:21:13.440,00:21:14.800
"So you guys will
learn depth for search",00:21:14.800,00:21:16.624
"on Monday, at which
point it will become",00:21:16.624,00:21:18.290
much clearer what I'm saying.,00:21:18.290,00:21:19.498
"But yeah, you always follow
the left branch as far down",00:21:19.498,00:21:22.530
as you can.,00:21:22.530,00:21:23.947
"Then you take the right
branch of that same branch",00:21:23.947,00:21:26.030
that you followed.,00:21:26.030,00:21:27.585
"Great, so we're going to
try to find that Millicent",00:21:27.585,00:21:29.710
is a protagonist.,00:21:29.710,00:21:30.980
What do we do first?,00:21:30.980,00:21:32.800
Everyone?,00:21:32.800,00:21:34.332
"Check assertion, yes.",00:21:34.332,00:21:36.016
Is it in there?,00:21:36.016,00:21:36.640
"No, it's not.",00:21:36.640,00:21:37.970
OK.,00:21:37.970,00:21:38.990
"So, therefore we're
going to try to find",00:21:38.990,00:21:42.150
"a rule as we heard about whether
Millicent is a protagonist.",00:21:42.150,00:21:47.270
"So, all the way in the back?",00:21:47.270,00:21:51.740
"All the way in the back, is
there a rule that matches?",00:21:51.740,00:21:54.938
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:21:54.938,00:21:56.157
"MARK SEIFTER: That
matches in its consequent",00:21:56.157,00:21:57.990
that Millicent is a protagonist.,00:21:57.990,00:22:00.810
"AUDIENCE: Um, there is a rule.",00:22:00.810,00:22:05.712
MARK SEIFTER: OK.,00:22:05.712,00:22:06.420
"Well, let's give it a try.",00:22:06.420,00:22:07.590
Which one?,00:22:07.590,00:22:08.637
AUDIENCE: One.,00:22:08.637,00:22:09.220
"MARK SEIFTER: Rule
one, that's right.",00:22:09.220,00:22:10.761
"So therefore, we would have
to add what to our goal tree?",00:22:10.761,00:22:15.380
AUDIENCE: Another [INAUDIBLE].,00:22:15.380,00:22:18.419
MARK SEIFTER: Right.,00:22:18.419,00:22:19.252
And what's on that please?,00:22:19.252,00:22:21.188
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:22:24.092,00:22:25.060
"MARK SEIFTER: Yeah, Millicent
lives in Gryffindor Tower,",00:22:25.060,00:22:27.238
perfect.,00:22:27.238,00:22:27.738
"So, our new thing that
we're searching for",00:22:27.738,00:22:31.550
is-- pretend this connects.,00:22:31.550,00:22:35.350
"Actually, I guess
it does connect.",00:22:35.350,00:22:37.170
"We're looking for m lives
in Gryffindor Tower.",00:22:37.170,00:22:41.860
Great.,00:22:41.860,00:22:43.484
"And since it's depth first,
that's where we go next.",00:22:43.484,00:22:45.650
"Great, we're on a roll.",00:22:45.650,00:22:47.270
So what do we do first?,00:22:47.270,00:22:50.792
Do we have that in assertions?,00:22:50.792,00:22:53.440
"Some people say yes,
but the answer is no.",00:22:53.440,00:22:55.750
"We have, in fact, Seamus
living in Gryffindor Tower.",00:22:55.750,00:22:58.910
"Most of you said ""no.""",00:22:58.910,00:23:00.390
You're right.,00:23:00.390,00:23:01.000
The majority rules.,00:23:01.000,00:23:02.650
We don't have any assertions.,00:23:02.650,00:23:04.310
"However, do we have a rule
with that in the consequent?",00:23:04.310,00:23:08.180
No.,00:23:08.180,00:23:08.920
So what do we do?,00:23:08.920,00:23:09.690
"People are saying different
things that are all correct.",00:23:13.647,00:23:15.980
"Backtrack, you say.",00:23:15.980,00:23:16.790
Go to the next.,00:23:16.790,00:23:17.420
We can't prove it.,00:23:17.420,00:23:18.170
All correct.,00:23:18.170,00:23:20.520
Put a big x.,00:23:20.520,00:23:22.960
This isn't true.,00:23:22.960,00:23:24.282
Now we'd look up.,00:23:24.282,00:23:24.990
We're on an OR node.,00:23:24.990,00:23:26.100
"So we're not done yet because
either of those can be true.",00:23:26.100,00:23:32.490
"So now we go back up, backtrack,
Millicent is a villain.",00:23:32.490,00:23:36.120
What do we do first?,00:23:38.850,00:23:40.778
Check assertions.,00:23:40.778,00:23:42.152
Is it in there?,00:23:42.152,00:23:43.070
"No, it's not.",00:23:43.070,00:23:44.330
"Don't worry, we're getting
to one where it will be,",00:23:44.330,00:23:46.880
"where about 40%-- or 30%
to 40% of the class lost",00:23:46.880,00:23:50.460
"points, very, very soon.",00:23:50.460,00:23:54.160
"So, we see that
Millicent is a villain.",00:23:54.160,00:23:58.770
And it's not in the assertions.,00:23:58.770,00:24:00.430
"So therefore, is
there any rule that",00:24:00.430,00:24:03.930
has that in its consequent?,00:24:03.930,00:24:06.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:24:09.684,00:24:10.559
"MARK SEIFTER: We're looking
for Millicent is a villain.",00:24:12.749,00:24:15.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:24:17.658,00:24:18.533
"MARK SEIFTER: Oh,
you can't see it.",00:24:22.902,00:24:24.360
"All right, I will
move it down slightly.",00:24:24.360,00:24:26.200
"It got a little bit off kilter
when I put in the parentheses",00:24:26.200,00:24:29.422
"around the ""and.""",00:24:29.422,00:24:30.130
Hold on.,00:24:30.130,00:24:32.350
There you go.,00:24:32.350,00:24:32.900
"AUDIENCE: If [INAUDIBLE] is a
protagonist or is a villain.",00:24:36.830,00:24:41.150

"MARK SEIFTER: We're
trying to prove",00:24:43.422,00:24:44.880
"that she's a villain, though.",00:24:44.880,00:24:46.088
"So do we have any with
that in the consequent?",00:24:46.088,00:24:49.255
"[INAUDIBLE] anything
that will prove",00:24:49.255,00:24:50.755
"that she's a villain if
we fire off that rule.",00:24:50.755,00:24:53.070
"Want to give here a
little bit of help?",00:24:56.150,00:24:58.162
AUDIENCE: P2.,00:24:58.162,00:24:58.703
"If she lives in Slytherin, then
she's a villain [INAUDIBLE].",00:24:58.703,00:25:01.569
"MARK SEIFTER: Ah, see that now?",00:25:01.569,00:25:02.860
"It had two, so it was
a little bit harder.",00:25:02.860,00:25:05.200
"Now some people ask, what
about that ambitious thing?",00:25:05.200,00:25:07.510
"Can we like add that to
the tree or something?",00:25:07.510,00:25:09.426
No.,00:25:09.426,00:25:10.190
"The backward chainer is
single-minded, focused,",00:25:10.190,00:25:12.800
and stupid.,00:25:12.800,00:25:14.097
"Even though it's later going
to need to prove that she's",00:25:14.097,00:25:16.430
"ambitious, it doesn't care.",00:25:16.430,00:25:18.239
It just sees the villain there.,00:25:18.239,00:25:19.530
"Villain, oh, that's great.",00:25:19.530,00:25:21.200
"As long as we've
got the antecedent",00:25:21.200,00:25:23.370
we are going to be happy.,00:25:23.370,00:25:27.690
"This is actually
an important point,",00:25:27.690,00:25:29.290
"not in this particular problem,
but in some other problems.",00:25:29.290,00:25:32.200
"So by using P2,
we're obviously going",00:25:32.200,00:25:36.280
"to have the antecedent x
lives in Slytherin dungeon.",00:25:36.280,00:25:40.151
And x here is Millicent.,00:25:40.151,00:25:41.150
"So Millicent lives
in Slytherin dungeon.",00:25:41.150,00:25:42.816
"All right, so what's
the first thing",00:25:47.720,00:25:49.600
"we do when we see
this new assertion?",00:25:49.600,00:25:51.380
We check the assertions.,00:25:54.430,00:25:55.430
Is it in there?,00:25:55.430,00:25:56.910
Yes.,00:25:56.910,00:25:57.600
"That's not where
everyone lost points,",00:25:57.600,00:25:59.183
"but yes, it is in there.",00:25:59.183,00:26:01.314
Check.,00:26:01.314,00:26:02.290
This OR node is happy.,00:26:02.290,00:26:05.260
"Now we move up to the AND node
with Millicent is ambitious.",00:26:05.260,00:26:08.680
So Millicent is ambitious.,00:26:08.680,00:26:11.080
What do we do now?,00:26:11.080,00:26:11.830
"AUDIENCE: So isn't
the consequent of P2",00:26:14.830,00:26:18.770
"that x is a villain
and x is ambitious.",00:26:18.770,00:26:21.210
"I don't know if it's
[INAUDIBLE] or whatever,",00:26:21.210,00:26:25.114
"but in our assertions we have
that Millicent is ambitious.",00:26:25.114,00:26:28.042
Is that necessary to let us--,00:26:28.042,00:26:29.994
"MARK SEIFTER: To
let us use rule two.",00:26:29.994,00:26:31.954
"Actually, no.",00:26:31.954,00:26:33.940
"The question is,
do we need the x is",00:26:33.940,00:26:40.660
"ambitious to be in our list of
assertions in order to use P2.",00:26:40.660,00:26:45.520
"For instance, if we didn't have
the assertion that Millicent",00:26:45.520,00:26:48.280
"is ambitious, would P2
have a problem firing?",00:26:48.280,00:26:51.167
"So, it's a very
interesting question.",00:26:54.030,00:26:56.315
"It's sort of what
actually I was trying",00:26:56.315,00:26:57.940
"to mention earlier when I
said it's single-minded,",00:26:57.940,00:27:02.140
"it's focused, it doesn't
care about the other one.",00:27:02.140,00:27:04.550
"Because you might say,
well, wait a minute,",00:27:04.550,00:27:06.341
"P2 could never
have actually fired",00:27:06.341,00:27:08.300
"if it didn't have both
of its consequents.",00:27:08.300,00:27:10.520
"But in fact, the backward
chainer doesn't care.",00:27:10.520,00:27:14.130
"All that the backward
chainer is looking to do",00:27:14.130,00:27:16.560
"is to prove whether
or not there's",00:27:16.560,00:27:19.760
"a possibility that Millicent
might be a villain.",00:27:19.760,00:27:23.880
"It's not trying to say,
oh, all the results",00:27:23.880,00:27:26.530
"of some certain rules are
making Millicent a villain",00:27:26.530,00:27:30.455
"and all the other things that
are there, like ambitious, are",00:27:30.455,00:27:33.390
in the database.,00:27:33.390,00:27:34.522
It's not the forward chainer.,00:27:34.522,00:27:35.730
It actually doesn't care.,00:27:35.730,00:27:37.130
"This sometimes leads to
unnecessary computation.",00:27:37.130,00:27:39.560
"But it's very simple, and
it's very simple to code.",00:27:39.560,00:27:42.110
"So it often will probably
speed you up in the long run.",00:27:42.110,00:27:45.160
"Like if there's, for instance,
100 thing in the then",00:27:45.160,00:27:48.150
"and you only care
about one of them,",00:27:48.150,00:27:50.226
"it would be a waste,
almost, to add those 99.",00:27:50.226,00:27:52.100
"There's a follow up

point, every time",00:28:11.740,00:28:13.600

have used those rules.",00:28:17.250,00:28:19.270

you make a hash table",00:28:19.270,00:28:22.660
"with all of the 100 things
that were in the consequent?",00:28:22.660,00:28:26.190
"And then, after having
made that hash table",00:28:26.190,00:28:28.840
"since you were already
walking through those anyway",00:28:28.840,00:28:31.320
"when you were checking
it, you could add those",00:28:31.320,00:28:33.300
to the assertions.,00:28:33.300,00:28:34.049
"The problem is that you
might not necessarily",00:28:34.049,00:28:36.830
"want-- with the backward
chainer-- you might not",00:28:36.830,00:28:40.200
"necessarily want
to think that all",00:28:40.200,00:28:42.340

are necessarily true.",00:28:42.340,00:28:46.860
"However, you might
not care about them.",00:28:46.860,00:28:49.620
"And then you have
to make an order",00:28:49.620,00:28:51.590
"and computation every time you
check that list of assertions",00:28:51.590,00:28:54.090
in the upper left.,00:28:54.090,00:28:55.271

what assertions there are.",00:28:59.819,00:29:02.110
"You have to check the
entire list of assertions",00:29:02.110,00:29:04.200
"in the upper left

to a new node in the goal tree.,00:29:06.240,00:29:07.760

specific assertion is order n.",00:29:09.550,00:29:13.060
"I'm saying every time you get
a new node in the goal tree,",00:29:13.060,00:29:15.530

anyway. [INAUDIBLE] assertions.",00:29:17.999,00:29:20.540

have to check for the four.",00:29:20.540,00:29:22.748
"But let's say that there were
10,000 consequents of P2.",00:29:22.748,00:29:26.710

10,000 instead of four",00:29:26.710,00:29:28.930

all after proving",00:29:28.930,00:29:31.750
P2 was true on the goal tree.,00:29:31.750,00:29:33.990

note is that you might not",00:29:33.990,00:29:37.820
"use every branch
of the goal tree,",00:29:37.820,00:29:39.420

OR that's up higher",00:29:39.420,00:29:41.160
"and you wind up using a
different branch, in which case",00:29:41.160,00:29:43.110
"you'd probably have to
make a separate hash",00:29:43.110,00:29:44.901

using this ""then"" statement",00:31:14.630,00:31:17.618

you get x is ambitious.",00:31:19.610,00:31:23.096

the question is,",00:31:31.845,00:31:33.220

two somewhere in the tree",00:31:33.220,00:31:36.370

a villain, which",00:31:36.370,00:31:38.480

Millicent is ambitious.",00:33:49.300,00:33:51.190

is out of the bag",00:33:51.190,00:33:53.259
"because there is a question
mentioning that there",00:33:53.259,00:33:55.300

our favorite rule, rule two.",00:33:57.130,00:34:01.290

that Millicent is ambitious?,00:34:03.000,00:34:05.480
"The answer is if you want to
lose four points or however",00:34:05.480,00:34:08.010
"many points, then yes.",00:34:08.010,00:34:09.420

also, that this over here,",00:34:22.280,00:34:26.250

studies a lot is rule three.",00:34:36.210,00:34:40.980

we have what rules here?",00:34:40.980,00:34:48.989

rule, which is one,",00:34:48.989,00:34:52.870

rule which is two.",00:34:52.870,00:34:55.610

studies a lot.",00:35:08.670,00:35:10.700

to go a little bit more",00:35:10.700,00:35:12.824
"quickly based on time, and so
I will do the remaining things.",00:35:12.824,00:35:16.080
"Anyone who has not been
called on is off the hook.",00:35:16.080,00:35:18.270

not to pay attention",00:35:18.270,00:35:19.760

interesting stuff still to come.",00:35:19.760,00:35:22.100
"So, Millicent is a protagonist.",00:35:22.100,00:35:24.350
"Well, good news, everyone.",00:35:24.350,00:35:27.460

that I can do this",00:35:27.460,00:35:29.770

told me what I need to do.",00:35:29.770,00:35:32.500

use rule one, rule one.",00:35:32.500,00:35:37.810
"And check if she lives
in Gryffindor tower.",00:35:37.810,00:35:40.580
"Now, will it do it again?",00:35:40.580,00:35:43.031
Yes it will.,00:35:43.031,00:35:44.340
"It hasn't cached that
it's already tried that.",00:35:44.340,00:35:47.715
"Now, hash table not
withstanding, caching something",00:35:47.715,00:35:49.840

a good idea with backward",00:35:49.840,00:35:52.810
"chaining, but we do not
do that in this class.",00:35:52.810,00:35:55.070

something you can do.",00:35:56.610,00:35:58.672

that we've already tried.",00:35:58.672,00:36:00.630
"We try them again, dammit.",00:36:00.630,00:36:03.250

maybe it'll work this time.",00:36:03.250,00:36:06.170
"No, it never works.",00:36:06.170,00:36:07.390

"Millicent does not
become Hermione's friend.",00:36:19.310,00:36:22.120

us a few questions",00:36:22.120,00:36:24.510
"which are pretty easy to answer
based on the ordeal we've just",00:36:24.510,00:36:28.020
been through.,00:36:28.020,00:36:28.950

number of additional assertions",00:36:28.950,00:36:32.580

to add for Millicent",00:36:32.580,00:36:34.450
to become Hermione's friend.,00:36:34.450,00:36:38.180

assertion-- in other words,",00:36:43.820,00:36:47.060

will prove some other rules.",00:36:47.060,00:36:51.030
"You have to add an assertion
that directly-- yeah,",00:36:51.030,00:36:55.090
that's basically the rule here.,00:36:55.090,00:36:56.880
"Because there's
a lot of choices.",00:36:56.880,00:36:58.820
"But he wanted one
particular answer.",00:36:58.820,00:37:01.440
"And so can anyone
think of an assertion",00:37:01.440,00:37:03.105
"that doesn't match any
consequent of any rule that",00:37:03.105,00:37:06.650
"will make her be
Hermione's friend.",00:37:06.650,00:37:11.560
"A lot of people say Millicent
lives in Gryffindor.",00:37:11.560,00:37:13.680
That's correct.,00:37:13.680,00:37:14.304
"So, part three, your
solution to part two",00:37:14.304,00:37:16.640
causes an uncommon situation.,00:37:16.640,00:37:18.650
What is the uncommon situation?,00:37:18.650,00:37:21.140
"And what should you do
to the list of assertions",00:37:21.140,00:37:23.780
to solve this problem?,00:37:23.780,00:37:24.770
"Does anyone know what
the uncommon situation",00:37:27.207,00:37:29.040
"would be if we added that
she lives in Gryffindor?",00:37:29.040,00:37:31.300
Hand is raised up here.,00:37:31.300,00:37:32.330
What is your answer?,00:37:32.330,00:37:33.935
[INAUDIBLE] That's true.,00:37:33.935,00:37:36.687
"She lives in Gryffindor
and Slytherin.",00:37:36.687,00:37:38.270
So how would you fix that?,00:37:38.270,00:37:41.742
"[INAUDIBLE] Yes,
you could take out",00:37:41.742,00:37:46.090
"Slytherin from the assertions
and say that she only",00:37:46.090,00:37:49.270
lived in Gryffindor.,00:37:49.270,00:37:50.540
"A lot of people gave the
answer to this question,",00:37:50.540,00:37:54.159
"which is a perfectly
reasonable thing",00:37:54.159,00:37:55.700
to do in a rules-basis system.,00:37:55.700,00:37:57.270
"They said, well, we
can add a rule that",00:37:57.270,00:37:59.440
"says that if you live in x and
y is different than x, then",00:37:59.440,00:38:06.060
you can't live in y.,00:38:06.060,00:38:08.040
"The problem with that,
among other things,",00:38:08.040,00:38:10.520
"is that we asked for a way to
change the assertions and not",00:38:10.520,00:38:13.290
the rules.,00:38:13.290,00:38:13.850
"And you gave us a way to
change the assertions.",00:38:13.850,00:38:15.340
That's the right answer.,00:38:15.340,00:38:16.340
"There was another
backward chaining problem,",00:38:22.310,00:38:25.210
"this is 2009 quiz one,
and I will leave it off",00:38:25.210,00:38:32.030
for the moment.,00:38:32.030,00:38:32.800
"You guys should
take a look at it,",00:38:32.800,00:38:35.110
"in particular with
variable binding.",00:38:35.110,00:38:37.550
"Because remember, you
always have to bind",00:38:37.550,00:38:40.150
"the variable that's
relevant to you.",00:38:40.150,00:38:42.171
"But that doesn't mean
that you always have",00:38:42.171,00:38:43.920
to bind all of the variables.,00:38:43.920,00:38:45.460
"For instance, let's
say that we wanted",00:38:45.460,00:38:47.270
"to prove that Millicent
has a bad term, which",00:38:47.270,00:38:49.290
"as it turns out, is
what we wanted to prove",00:38:49.290,00:38:51.081
in the other backward chaining.,00:38:51.081,00:38:52.490
"Very quickly and without doing
the problem, can anyone who",00:38:52.490,00:38:57.549
"thinks they're very clever
at backward chaining tell me",00:38:57.549,00:38:59.840
"exactly what things would
be added to the goal tree",00:38:59.840,00:39:03.860
"to prove that Millicent
has a bad term?",00:39:03.860,00:39:05.590
Raise your hand.,00:39:05.590,00:39:06.256
"I won't pick out a
victim because I'm asking",00:39:06.256,00:39:08.350
this to happen pretty quickly.,00:39:08.350,00:39:09.955
No one?,00:39:12.750,00:39:13.330
All right.,00:39:18.190,00:39:20.732
"AUDIENCE: You would add the
three antecedents to rule--",00:39:20.732,00:39:25.405
MARK SEIFTER: To rule five.,00:39:25.405,00:39:26.530
"So what would you
add specifically?",00:39:26.530,00:39:28.580
"AUDIENCE: For anyone,
variable-wise,",00:39:28.580,00:39:30.282
"you would just have to
show that there is at least",00:39:30.282,00:39:32.365
one person who matches.,00:39:32.365,00:39:34.160
"MARK SEIFTER: So can you
just sort of read out,",00:39:34.160,00:39:36.860
"what would the first
thing say with the snogs?",00:39:36.860,00:39:39.580
"AUDIENCE: X snogs-- or
Millicent snogs anyone.",00:39:39.580,00:39:44.200
"MARK SEIFTER: Yeah,
Millicent snogs y.",00:39:44.200,00:39:47.200
That's crucial.,00:39:47.200,00:39:48.120
"Some people did a lot
of different things.",00:39:48.120,00:39:49.910
"Some people put
Seamus in already.",00:39:49.910,00:39:51.660
You can't do that.,00:39:51.660,00:39:53.140
"The system is stupid, it doesn't
know that the person is Seamus.",00:39:53.140,00:39:55.970
"Also, some people
said it worked,",00:39:55.970,00:39:57.860
"because look, they're
snogging each other,",00:39:57.860,00:39:59.610
"but it's the wrong snoggle
direction up there.",00:39:59.610,00:40:03.130
"Because we have Seamus
snogging Millicent,",00:40:05.650,00:40:07.460
not Millicent snogging Seamus.,00:40:07.460,00:40:08.710
"But yes, exactly.",00:40:08.710,00:40:09.418
It would be Millicent snogs y.,00:40:09.418,00:40:11.440
"Millicent lives in
Gryffindor tower.",00:40:11.440,00:40:12.980
y lives in Slytherin dungeon.,00:40:12.980,00:40:15.160
"So, let's give forward chaining
all the attention it deserves,",00:40:15.160,00:40:19.930
"about eight minutes, which
will be more than enough.",00:40:19.930,00:40:22.895
"OK, we still got
all these rules.",00:40:26.410,00:40:28.570
"We've still got all
these assertions.",00:40:28.570,00:40:30.410
"Instead of doing that horrible
backward chaining-- well,",00:40:30.410,00:40:33.345
"it's not that horrible-- but
we'll do forward chaining.",00:40:33.345,00:40:35.640
It'll be really easy.,00:40:35.640,00:40:36.880
"We'll just add new
assertions as they go.",00:40:36.880,00:40:38.900
Remember the tiebreak order.,00:40:38.900,00:40:41.260
Rules in order from 0 to 5.,00:40:41.260,00:40:43.400
"And if the same
rule could fire off",00:40:43.400,00:40:46.490
"with multiple
different assertions,",00:40:46.490,00:40:48.530
"we'll use the assertions
in order from 0 to 3.",00:40:48.530,00:40:51.160
So let's see.,00:40:51.160,00:40:55.160
"We don't have much time, but
with our four assertions,",00:40:55.160,00:40:59.530
"let's see, what
rules possibly could",00:40:59.530,00:41:01.310
match with our four assertions?,00:41:01.310,00:41:04.110
"Well, I'll figure out for you.",00:41:04.110,00:41:06.390
"Do we have an assertion
about an ambitious person?",00:41:06.390,00:41:09.100
Yes.,00:41:09.100,00:41:09.600
But they're not a squib.,00:41:09.600,00:41:10.720
So not rule zero.,00:41:10.720,00:41:11.917
"Do we have someone that
lives in Gryffindor?",00:41:11.917,00:41:13.750
We absolutely do.,00:41:13.750,00:41:14.580
Rule one is matches.,00:41:14.580,00:41:16.019
"Do we have someone that
lives in Slytherin?",00:41:16.019,00:41:17.810
We do.,00:41:17.810,00:41:18.560
Rule two matches.,00:41:18.560,00:41:19.550
"Do we have a protagonist
or a villain?",00:41:19.550,00:41:21.850
"We don't have any
protagonist or villain.",00:41:21.850,00:41:23.680
"Rule three is not going to
match because it's in an ""and.""",00:41:23.680,00:41:26.500
"do we have someone
who studies a lot?",00:41:26.500,00:41:28.440
"We do not have someone
who studies a lot.",00:41:28.440,00:41:30.149
Rule four is not going to match.,00:41:30.149,00:41:31.481
Do we have some snogging?,00:41:31.481,00:41:32.730
We do have some snogging.,00:41:32.730,00:41:34.220
"So rule one, two,
and five match.",00:41:34.220,00:41:36.500
"So m for matching, we
have one, two and five.",00:41:36.500,00:41:40.810
"Everyone, which one wins the
tiebreak between one, two,",00:41:40.810,00:41:43.180
and five?,00:41:43.180,00:41:44.350
"One, because it comes
first numerically.",00:41:44.350,00:41:47.070
"Which one is rule one if x
lives in Gryffindor tower?",00:41:47.070,00:41:50.740
"The only binding
for x is Seamus.",00:41:50.740,00:41:52.980
"Seamus lives in
Gryffindor tower.",00:41:52.980,00:41:54.810
We're firing off rule one.,00:41:54.810,00:41:57.520
"So new assertions, the first
assertion that we'll add",00:41:57.520,00:42:01.260
is Seamus is it a protagonist.,00:42:01.260,00:42:06.075
Great.,00:42:06.075,00:42:06.575
"Now, there's one
other thing, and it's",00:42:09.380,00:42:12.060
"the main thing I wanted to tell
you about in forward chaining.",00:42:12.060,00:42:16.590
"About our old friend, rule
one, now that we've done this,",00:42:16.590,00:42:19.420
"does rule one still match an
assertion in the database?",00:42:19.420,00:42:22.940
Yes.,00:42:26.430,00:42:27.450
It does.,00:42:27.450,00:42:28.590
"But what's going to stop us
from constantly doing rule one",00:42:28.590,00:42:32.186
"every time because
it comes numerically",00:42:32.186,00:42:33.810
before the other rules?,00:42:33.810,00:42:35.650
"What stops us there is a
part of our implementation.",00:42:35.650,00:42:38.260
"And it's a very important part
that people sometimes forget.",00:42:38.260,00:42:40.840
"It's what I like to call
the no-impotent rules",00:42:40.840,00:42:44.240
implementation detail.,00:42:44.240,00:42:45.240
"That is, if a rule
is completely,",00:42:45.240,00:42:47.220
"100% impotent, it would
do absolutely nothing.",00:42:47.220,00:42:51.190
Then you do not fire it.,00:42:51.190,00:42:52.505
You go to the next one.,00:42:52.505,00:42:53.990
That's pretty important.,00:42:53.990,00:42:55.200
"Let's say that you possibly
had a delete, which",00:42:55.200,00:42:57.350
you won't have on the quiz.,00:42:57.350,00:42:59.660
"That means that if the
thing to delete is missing,",00:42:59.660,00:43:02.630
it's impotent.,00:43:02.630,00:43:03.520
"If the thing to delete is
there, it's not impotent",00:43:03.520,00:43:05.720
because you can delete.,00:43:05.720,00:43:07.200
"Let's say you have 500,000
things that you're going",00:43:07.200,00:43:09.990
to add to your assertions.,00:43:09.990,00:43:11.700
"499,999 are already
in your database.",00:43:11.700,00:43:15.670
One of them is missing.,00:43:15.670,00:43:16.740
Is it an impotent rule?,00:43:16.740,00:43:18.390
"No, it's not.",00:43:18.390,00:43:19.090
You have to fire it anyway.,00:43:19.090,00:43:20.360
"You can't be like, oh,
it's mostly impotent rule.",00:43:20.360,00:43:23.060
No.,00:43:23.060,00:43:23.560
"You have fire off the rule
if it will do anything.",00:43:23.560,00:43:27.147
"But right now rule one won't do
anything because we've already",00:43:27.147,00:43:29.730
added Seamus is a protagonist.,00:43:29.730,00:43:31.590
So what rules match down?,00:43:31.590,00:43:34.260
"Well, Seamus becoming a
protagonist is nice and all,",00:43:34.260,00:43:37.510
"but he's not ambitious, so we
still don't match rule three.",00:43:37.510,00:43:40.620
"We still match rules
one, two, and five.",00:43:40.620,00:43:43.230
"As I basically just got
finished telling you,",00:43:43.230,00:43:45.460
"the one that we're going
to fire off now is two.",00:43:45.460,00:43:48.930
That's right.,00:43:48.930,00:43:50.000
"So, rule two is if x
lives in Slytherin dungeon",00:43:50.000,00:43:54.240
"our only [? binding ?]
for that is Millicent.",00:43:54.240,00:43:57.130
"And that will show that she's
a villain and she's ambitious.",00:43:57.130,00:43:59.950
So what assertions will we add?,00:43:59.950,00:44:04.372
Millicent is a villain.,00:44:04.372,00:44:05.330
And people stopped.,00:44:05.330,00:44:06.570
That's right.,00:44:06.570,00:44:07.380
"Good job, everyone.",00:44:07.380,00:44:08.410
"You remembered that
Millicent is already",00:44:08.410,00:44:10.350
"ambitious from assertion one, so
we don't have to add them both.",00:44:10.350,00:44:15.080
A lot of people did.,00:44:15.080,00:44:16.340
They were wrong.,00:44:16.340,00:44:17.580
So Millicent is a villain.,00:44:17.580,00:44:21.550
"The other part of that
rule doesn't do anything.",00:44:21.550,00:44:24.020
"But it's not an impotent rule
because one of the things",00:44:24.020,00:44:26.420
is not on there.,00:44:26.420,00:44:27.410
Great.,00:44:27.410,00:44:29.740
"So, what rules match now?",00:44:29.740,00:44:31.890
"Well, as it turns out,
now that Millicent",00:44:31.890,00:44:34.150
"is a villain and ambitious,
we match rule three as well.",00:44:34.150,00:44:37.700
"So we match one,
two, three, and five.",00:44:37.700,00:44:41.370
"What rule are we going
to fire, everyone?",00:44:41.370,00:44:43.710
Three.,00:44:43.710,00:44:44.210
"Because one and two
are impotent rules.",00:44:44.210,00:44:47.470
We'll fire rule three.,00:44:47.470,00:44:48.890
"Well, Millicent is a villain.",00:44:48.890,00:44:50.800
She's also ambitious.,00:44:50.800,00:44:51.770
She's our only match for three.,00:44:51.770,00:44:53.890
"Therefore, what
assertion do we add?",00:44:53.890,00:44:57.250
Millicent studies a lot.,00:44:57.250,00:44:58.250
That's right.,00:44:58.250,00:44:58.791
"So, Millicent studies a lot.",00:45:05.030,00:45:07.220
"However, she's
not a protagonist.",00:45:07.220,00:45:08.820
We still don't match rule four.,00:45:08.820,00:45:12.180
"Oh well, we figured that
out already ourselves",00:45:12.180,00:45:14.520
"from backward chaining that we
were never going to match that.",00:45:14.520,00:45:17.400
So what matches?,00:45:17.400,00:45:19.210
"It's still one, two,
three, and five.",00:45:19.210,00:45:21.200
"Seeing as one, two and
three are impotent,",00:45:21.200,00:45:22.950
the only match is five.,00:45:22.950,00:45:26.695
"So the only match we
care about, the only one",00:45:26.695,00:45:28.570
we're going to fire is five.,00:45:28.570,00:45:30.970
And the result?,00:45:30.970,00:45:32.220

a new assertion which matches",00:46:06.000,00:46:09.640
"a rule but it's
really high number,",00:46:09.640,00:46:11.520
"it's all the way down at
the bottom of the rules,",00:46:11.520,00:46:14.150
"but it's new and
it has new stuff,",00:46:14.150,00:46:16.350
"should we do that first,
maybe, because it's new?",00:46:16.350,00:46:20.220
"Oh, you mean that it has a
lower number, a lower number?",00:46:20.220,00:46:23.075

be a squib.,00:46:29.270,00:46:30.920
"Then yes, you'd
immediately not only match",00:46:30.920,00:46:33.090
"zero-- zero would immediately
fire because numerically",00:46:33.090,00:46:36.715
