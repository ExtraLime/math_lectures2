"Yes, OK, four, three,
two, one, OK, I",00:00:03.890,00:00:09.130
"see you guys are
in a happy mood.",00:00:09.130,00:00:10.880
"I don't know if that
means 18.06 is ending,",00:00:10.880,00:00:13.980
"or, the quiz was good.",00:00:13.980,00:00:16.680
"Uh, my birthday
conference was going",00:00:16.680,00:00:21.030
"on at the time of the quiz, and
in the conference, of course,",00:00:21.030,00:00:24.880
"everybody had to
say nice things,",00:00:24.880,00:00:27.190
"but I was wondering,
what would my 18.06",00:00:27.190,00:00:30.390
"class be saying, because it was
at the exactly the same time.",00:00:30.390,00:00:36.200
"But, what I know from
the grades so far,",00:00:36.200,00:00:39.300
"they're basically close to, and
maybe slightly above the grades",00:00:39.300,00:00:45.440
that you got on quiz two.,00:00:45.440,00:00:48.590
"So, very satisfactory.",00:00:48.590,00:00:52.790
"And, then we have a
final exam coming up,",00:00:52.790,00:00:56.550
"and today's lecture,
as I told you by email,",00:00:56.550,00:01:00.780
"will be a first
step in the review,",00:01:00.780,00:01:05.019
"and then on Wednesday
I'll do all I can",00:01:05.019,00:01:07.890
in reviewing the whole course.,00:01:07.890,00:01:13.560
"So my topic today
is -- actually,",00:01:13.560,00:01:16.300
"this is a lecture I have never
given before in this way,",00:01:16.300,00:01:24.740
"and it will -- well,
four subspaces,",00:01:24.740,00:01:28.310
"that's certainly fundamental,
and you know that,",00:01:28.310,00:01:32.190
"so I want to speak
about left-inverses",00:01:32.190,00:01:34.810
"and right-inverses and
then something called",00:01:34.810,00:01:37.150
pseudo-inverses.,00:01:37.150,00:01:39.190
"And pseudo-inverses,
let me say right away,",00:01:39.190,00:01:43.110
"that comes in near the
end of chapter seven,",00:01:43.110,00:01:47.240
"and that would not be
expected on the final.",00:01:47.240,00:01:52.170
"But you'll see that
what I'm talking about",00:01:52.170,00:01:54.840
"is really the basic stuff that,
for an m-by-n matrix of rank r,",00:01:54.840,00:02:01.600
"we're going back to the most
fundamental picture in linear",00:02:01.600,00:02:06.080
algebra.,00:02:06.080,00:02:07.130
"Nobody could forget
that picture, right?",00:02:07.130,00:02:12.020
"When you're my age, even,
you'll remember the row space,",00:02:12.020,00:02:15.890
and the null space.,00:02:15.890,00:02:17.560
"Orthogonal complements over
there, the column space",00:02:17.560,00:02:21.130
"and the null space of
A transpose column,",00:02:21.130,00:02:23.530
"orthogonal
complements over here.",00:02:23.530,00:02:26.190
"And I want to speak
about inverses.",00:02:26.190,00:02:29.220
OK.,00:02:29.220,00:02:30.320
"And I want to identify the
different possibilities.",00:02:30.320,00:02:33.960
"So first of all,
when does a matrix",00:02:33.960,00:02:37.980
"have a just a perfect
inverse, two-sided, you know,",00:02:37.980,00:02:42.440
"so the two-sided inverse is what
we just call inverse, right?",00:02:42.440,00:02:51.600
"And, so that means that
there's a matrix that",00:02:51.600,00:02:57.720
"produces the identity, whether
we write it on the left",00:02:57.720,00:03:02.010
or on the right.,00:03:02.010,00:03:03.670
"And just tell me, how
are the numbers r,",00:03:03.670,00:03:10.170
"the rank, n the number of
columns, m the number of rows,",00:03:10.170,00:03:16.580
"how are those
numbers related when",00:03:16.580,00:03:19.070
we have an invertible matrix?,00:03:19.070,00:03:21.320
"So this is the
matrix which was --",00:03:21.320,00:03:23.690
"chapter two was all
about matrices like this,",00:03:23.690,00:03:26.540
"the beginning of the course,
what was the relation of th-",00:03:26.540,00:03:30.420
"of r, m, and n,
for the nice case?",00:03:30.420,00:03:36.110
"They're all the same, all equal.",00:03:36.110,00:03:39.360
So this is the case when r=m=n.,00:03:39.360,00:03:43.260
"Square matrix, full
rank, period, just --",00:03:43.260,00:03:46.910
so I'll use the words full rank.,00:03:46.910,00:03:50.480
"OK, good.",00:03:50.480,00:03:51.840
Everybody knows that.,00:03:51.840,00:03:53.800
OK.,00:03:53.800,00:03:55.860
Then chapter three.,00:03:55.860,00:03:56.875
"We began to deal with matrices
that were not of full rank,",00:03:59.660,00:04:03.240
"and they could have any rank,
and we learned what the rank",00:04:03.240,00:04:07.050
was.,00:04:07.050,00:04:08.480
"And then we focused,
if you remember",00:04:08.480,00:04:12.140
"on some cases like
full column rank.",00:04:12.140,00:04:17.110
"Now, can you remember what was
the deal with full column rank?",00:04:17.110,00:04:20.810
"So, now, I think this
is the case in which we",00:04:20.810,00:04:25.020
"have a left-inverse,
and I'll try to find it.",00:04:25.020,00:04:28.650
So we have a --,00:04:32.930,00:04:35.130
what was the situation there?,00:04:35.130,00:04:37.800
"It's the case of full column
rank, and that means --",00:04:37.800,00:04:43.780
what does that mean about r?,00:04:43.780,00:04:47.160
"It equals, what's
the deal with r, now,",00:04:47.160,00:04:51.770
"if we have full
column rank, I mean",00:04:51.770,00:04:54.460
"the columns are independent,
but maybe not the rows.",00:04:54.460,00:04:59.730
"So what is r equal
to in this case?",00:04:59.730,00:05:03.780
n.,00:05:03.780,00:05:04.450
Thanks.,00:05:04.450,00:05:05.780
n.,00:05:05.780,00:05:06.480
r=n.,00:05:06.480,00:05:06.979
"The n columns are
independent, but probably, we",00:05:06.979,00:05:10.270
have more rows.,00:05:10.270,00:05:12.920
"What's the picture, and then
what's the null space for this?",00:05:12.920,00:05:17.060
"So the n columns
are independent,",00:05:17.060,00:05:19.990
"what's the null
space in this case?",00:05:19.990,00:05:22.155
"So of course, you
know what I'm asking.",00:05:25.420,00:05:27.450
"You're saying, why is this guy
asking something, I know that--",00:05:27.450,00:05:30.690
"I think about it in my sleep,",00:05:30.690,00:05:32.680
right?,00:05:32.680,00:05:33.260
"So the null space of this
matrix if the rank is",00:05:33.260,00:05:36.900
"n, the null space is what
vectors are in the null space?",00:05:36.900,00:05:47.280
Just the zero vector.,00:05:47.280,00:05:48.410
Right?,00:05:51.320,00:05:51.820
The columns are independent.,00:05:51.820,00:05:53.360
Independent columns.,00:05:53.360,00:05:54.300
"No combination of the columns
gives zero except that one.",00:05:59.020,00:06:03.320
"And what's my picture over, --",00:06:03.320,00:06:06.270
let me redraw my picture --,00:06:06.270,00:06:10.050
the row space is everything.,00:06:10.050,00:06:14.330
No.,00:06:18.450,00:06:20.860
Is that right?,00:06:20.860,00:06:23.030
"Let's see, I often get
these turned around, right?",00:06:23.030,00:06:26.580
So what's the deal?,00:06:26.580,00:06:31.640
"The columns are
independent, right?",00:06:31.640,00:06:34.810
"So the rank should be the full
number of columns, so what",00:06:34.810,00:06:39.330
does that tell us?,00:06:39.330,00:06:41.250
"There's no null space, right.",00:06:41.250,00:06:43.051
OK.,00:06:43.051,00:06:43.550
"The row space is
the whole thing.",00:06:43.550,00:06:45.400
"Yes, I won't even
draw the picture.",00:06:45.400,00:06:48.510
And what was the deal with --,00:06:48.510,00:06:51.640
"and these were very important
in least squares problems",00:06:51.640,00:06:56.960
because --,00:06:56.960,00:06:58.750
"So, what more is true here?",00:06:58.750,00:07:06.230
"If we have full column rank,
the null space is zero,",00:07:06.230,00:07:09.460
"we have independent
columns, the unique --",00:07:09.460,00:07:14.640
"so we have zero or
one solutions to Ax=b.",00:07:14.640,00:07:22.990
"There may not be any solutions,
but if there's a solution,",00:07:25.790,00:07:28.660
"there's only one solution
because other solutions are",00:07:28.660,00:07:32.910
"found by adding on stuff
from the null space,",00:07:32.910,00:07:35.470
"and there's nobody
there to add on.",00:07:35.470,00:07:39.490
"So the particular
solution is the solution,",00:07:39.490,00:07:43.250
"if there is a
particular solution.",00:07:43.250,00:07:45.860
"But of course, the
rows might not be -",00:07:45.860,00:07:49.030
"are probably not independent
-- and therefore,",00:07:49.030,00:07:51.990
"so right-hand sides won't end
up with a zero equal zero after",00:07:51.990,00:07:56.880
"elimination, so sometimes
we may have no solution,",00:07:56.880,00:08:00.990
or one solution.,00:08:00.990,00:08:02.710
OK.,00:08:02.710,00:08:03.380
"And what I want to say is
that for this matrix A --",00:08:03.380,00:08:10.350
"oh, yes, tell me something about
A transpose A in this case.",00:08:10.350,00:08:13.910
"So this whole part of the board,
now, is devoted to this case.",00:08:13.910,00:08:20.240
"What's the deal
with A transpose A?",00:08:20.240,00:08:23.690
"I've emphasized over and over
how important that combination",00:08:23.690,00:08:27.280
"is, for a rectangular
matrix, A transpose A",00:08:27.280,00:08:32.120
"is the good thing to look
at, and if the rank is n,",00:08:32.120,00:08:37.120
"if the null space
has only zero in it,",00:08:37.120,00:08:39.750
"then the same is true
of A transpose A.",00:08:39.750,00:08:43.340
"That's the beautiful fact, that
if the rank of A is n, well,",00:08:43.340,00:08:49.250
"we know this will be an
n by n symmetric matrix,",00:08:49.250,00:08:52.300
and it will be full rank.,00:08:52.300,00:08:53.820
So this is invertible.,00:08:53.820,00:08:55.230
This matrix is invertible.,00:08:55.230,00:08:58.450
That matrix is invertible.,00:08:58.450,00:08:59.960
"And now I want to show
you that A itself has",00:08:59.960,00:09:04.070
a one-sided inverse.,00:09:04.070,00:09:06.880
Here it is.,00:09:06.880,00:09:08.450
"The inverse of that, which
exists, times A transpose,",00:09:08.450,00:09:17.190
"there is a one-sided --
shall I call it A inverse?",00:09:17.190,00:09:20.390
-- left of the matrix A.,00:09:20.390,00:09:24.160
Why do I say that?,00:09:24.160,00:09:28.680
"Because if I multiply this
guy by A, what do I get?",00:09:28.680,00:09:35.740
"What does that
multiplication give?",00:09:35.740,00:09:37.630
"Of course, you
know it instantly,",00:09:37.630,00:09:40.360
"because I just put
the parentheses there,",00:09:40.360,00:09:44.110
"I have A transpose A
inverse times A transpose A",00:09:44.110,00:09:47.000
"so, of course,
it's the identity.",00:09:47.000,00:09:49.090
So it's a left inverse.,00:09:49.090,00:09:52.120
"And this was the totally
crucial case for least squares,",00:09:52.120,00:09:58.830
"because you remember that least
squares, the central equation",00:09:58.830,00:10:02.920
"of least squares had this
matrix, A transpose A,",00:10:02.920,00:10:06.230
as its coefficient matrix.,00:10:06.230,00:10:08.920
"And in the case of
full column rank,",00:10:08.920,00:10:11.770
"that matrix is
invertible, and we're go.",00:10:11.770,00:10:15.910
"So that's the case where
there is a left-inverse.",00:10:15.910,00:10:19.830
"So A does whatever it does,
we can find a matrix that",00:10:19.830,00:10:26.140
brings it back to the identity.,00:10:26.140,00:10:30.530
"Now, is it true that,
in the other order --",00:10:30.530,00:10:33.710
"so A inverse left times
A is the identity.",00:10:33.710,00:10:36.830
Right?,00:10:42.131,00:10:42.630
This matrix is m by n.,00:10:42.630,00:10:46.100
This matrix is n by m.,00:10:46.100,00:10:49.580
The identity matrix is n by n.,00:10:49.580,00:10:52.060
All good.,00:10:52.060,00:10:53.560
All good if you're n.,00:10:53.560,00:10:56.300
"But if you try to put that
matrix on the other side,",00:10:56.300,00:11:02.850
it would fail.,00:11:02.850,00:11:05.280
"If the full column rank --
if this is smaller than m,",00:11:05.280,00:11:12.240
"the case where they're
equals is the beautiful case,",00:11:12.240,00:11:14.480
but that's all set.,00:11:14.480,00:11:16.270
"Now, we're looking
at the case where",00:11:16.270,00:11:18.100
"the columns are independent
but the rows are not.",00:11:18.100,00:11:21.440
"So this is invertible,
but what matrix is not",00:11:21.440,00:11:25.370
invertible?,00:11:25.370,00:11:26.670
"A A transpose is
bad for this case.",00:11:26.670,00:11:30.890
A transpose A is good.,00:11:30.890,00:11:32.570
"So we can multiply on the
left, everything good,",00:11:32.570,00:11:35.710
we get the left inverse.,00:11:35.710,00:11:39.130
"But it would not be
a two-sided inverse.",00:11:39.130,00:11:42.140
"A rectangular matrix can't
have a two-sided inverse,",00:11:42.140,00:11:46.680
"because there's got to be
some null space, right?",00:11:46.680,00:11:50.900
"If I have a matrix
that's rectangular,",00:11:50.900,00:11:53.840
"then either that
matrix or its transpose",00:11:53.840,00:11:58.920
"has some null space, because
if n and m are different,",00:11:58.920,00:12:02.340
"then there's going to be
some free variables around,",00:12:02.340,00:12:06.440
"and we'll have some null
space in that direction.",00:12:06.440,00:12:09.380
"OK, tell me the corresponding
picture for the opposite case.",00:12:09.380,00:12:17.070
"So now I'm going to ask
you about right-inverses.",00:12:17.070,00:12:20.840
A right-inverse.,00:12:20.840,00:12:22.325
"And you can fill
this all out, this",00:12:26.010,00:12:28.970
"is going to be the
case of full row rank.",00:12:28.970,00:12:31.410
"And then r is equal to m, now,
the m rows are independent,",00:12:34.420,00:12:41.870
but the columns are not.,00:12:41.870,00:12:45.270
So what's the deal on that?,00:12:45.270,00:12:47.000
"Well, just exactly
the flip of this one.",00:12:47.000,00:12:50.640
"The null space of A
transpose contains only zero,",00:12:50.640,00:12:57.400
"because there are no
combinations of the rows that",00:12:57.400,00:13:00.480
give the zero row.,00:13:00.480,00:13:02.390
We have independent rows.,00:13:02.390,00:13:03.750
"And in a minute, I'll give
an example of all these.",00:13:08.860,00:13:13.660
"So, how many solutions
to Ax=b in this case?",00:13:13.660,00:13:17.545
The rows are independent.,00:13:23.159,00:13:24.200
So we can always solve Ax=b.,00:13:27.050,00:13:30.980
"Whenever elimination
never produces a zero row,",00:13:30.980,00:13:34.540
"so we never get into that
zero equal one problem,",00:13:34.540,00:13:38.290
"so Ax=b always has a
solution, but too many.",00:13:38.290,00:13:43.470
"So there will be some null
space, the null space of A --",00:13:43.470,00:13:50.140
"what will be the dimension
of A's null space?",00:13:50.140,00:13:54.460
"How many free
variables have we got?",00:13:54.460,00:13:58.910
"How many special solutions in
that null space have we got?",00:13:58.910,00:14:03.410
"So how many free
variables in this setup?",00:14:03.410,00:14:06.090
"We've got n columns,
so n variables,",00:14:06.090,00:14:12.680
"and this tells us
how many are pivot",00:14:12.680,00:14:16.530
"variables, that tells us
how many pivots there are,",00:14:16.530,00:14:19.170
so there are n-m free variables.,00:14:19.170,00:14:21.930
"So there are infinitely
many solutions to Ax=b.",00:14:21.930,00:14:27.940
"We have n-m free
variables in this case.",00:14:27.940,00:14:37.220
OK.,00:14:37.220,00:14:38.240
"Now I wanted to ask about
this idea of a right-inverse.",00:14:38.240,00:14:45.600
OK.,00:14:45.600,00:14:46.720
"So I'm going to have a matrix
A, my matrix A, and now",00:14:46.720,00:14:52.710
"there's going to be some
inverse on the right that",00:14:52.710,00:14:54.960
will give the identity matrix.,00:14:54.960,00:14:57.710
"So it will be A times A inverse
on the right, will be I.",00:14:57.710,00:15:05.500
"And can you tell me
what, just by comparing",00:15:05.500,00:15:12.290
"with what we had up there,
what will be the right-inverse,",00:15:12.290,00:15:18.560
we even have a formula for it.,00:15:18.560,00:15:21.150
There will be other --,00:15:21.150,00:15:22.760
"actually, there are
other left-inverses,",00:15:22.760,00:15:24.820
that's our favorite.,00:15:24.820,00:15:26.610
"There will be other
right-inverses,",00:15:26.610,00:15:28.350
"but tell me our favorite here,
what's the nice right-inverse?",00:15:28.350,00:15:31.620
"The nice right-inverse
will be, well, there we",00:15:35.240,00:15:39.470
"had A transpose A
was good, now it",00:15:39.470,00:15:43.820
"will be A A transpose
that's good.",00:15:43.820,00:15:46.860
"The good matrix,
the good right --",00:15:46.860,00:15:49.680
"the thing we can invert
is A A transpose,",00:15:49.680,00:15:53.200
"so now if I just do it that way,
there sits the right-inverse.",00:15:53.200,00:16:00.540
"You see how completely parallel
it is to the one above?",00:16:00.540,00:16:03.930
Right.,00:16:11.220,00:16:11.964
So that's the right-inverse.,00:16:11.964,00:16:13.130
"So that's the case
when there is --",00:16:13.130,00:16:20.960
"In terms of this
picture, tell me",00:16:20.960,00:16:25.390
"what the null spaces are like
so far for these three cases.",00:16:25.390,00:16:29.770
"What about case
one, where we had",00:16:29.770,00:16:32.530
"a two-sided inverse, full
rank, everything great.",00:16:32.530,00:16:36.930
"The null spaces were,
like, gone, right?",00:16:36.930,00:16:41.290
"The null spaces were
just the zero vectors.",00:16:41.290,00:16:44.480
"Then I took case two,
this null space was gone.",00:16:44.480,00:16:49.590
"Case three, this null space was
gone, and then case four is,",00:16:52.990,00:16:58.890
"like, the most general case when
this picture is all there --",00:16:58.890,00:17:04.250
"when all the null spaces --
this has dimension r, of course,",00:17:04.250,00:17:10.680
"this has dimension n-r,
this has dimension r,",00:17:10.680,00:17:14.700
"this has dimension m-r, and the
final case will be when r is",00:17:14.700,00:17:26.800
smaller than m and n.,00:17:26.800,00:17:29.210
"But can I just,
before I leave here",00:17:29.210,00:17:38.940
look a little more at this one?,00:17:38.940,00:17:43.750
"At this case of
full column rank?",00:17:43.750,00:17:46.510
"So A inverse on the left,
it has this left-inverse",00:17:46.510,00:17:52.070
to give the identity.,00:17:52.070,00:17:53.930
"I said if we multiply
it in the other order,",00:17:53.930,00:17:56.540
we wouldn't get the identity.,00:17:56.540,00:17:57.970
"But then I just realized that I
should ask you, what do we get?",00:17:57.970,00:18:02.650
"So if I put them in
the other order --",00:18:02.650,00:18:05.260
"if I continue this down below,
but I write A times A inverse",00:18:05.260,00:18:19.010
"left -- so there's A
times the left-inverse,",00:18:19.010,00:18:21.040
"but it's not on
the left any more.",00:18:21.040,00:18:23.370
"So it's not going to
come out perfectly.",00:18:23.370,00:18:26.970
"But everybody in this room
ought to recognize that matrix,",00:18:26.970,00:18:35.990
right?,00:18:35.990,00:18:38.150
"Let's see, is that
the guy we know?",00:18:38.150,00:18:42.080
"Am I OK, here?",00:18:42.080,00:18:43.195
What is that matrix?,00:18:51.280,00:18:53.000
P. Thanks.,00:18:53.000,00:18:56.130
P. That matrix --,00:18:56.130,00:18:59.230
it's a projection.,00:18:59.230,00:19:02.070
"It's the projection
onto the column space.",00:19:02.070,00:19:07.750
"It's trying to be the
identity matrix, right?",00:19:07.750,00:19:12.340
"A projection matrix tries
to be the identity matrix,",00:19:12.340,00:19:17.620
"but you've given it,
an impossible job.",00:19:17.620,00:19:22.140
"So it's the identity
matrix where it can be,",00:19:22.140,00:19:25.240
"and elsewhere, it's
the zero matrix.",00:19:25.240,00:19:27.750
"So this is P, right.",00:19:27.750,00:19:29.820
"A projection onto
the column space.",00:19:29.820,00:19:34.190
"And if I asked you this one,
and put these in the opposite",00:19:34.190,00:19:38.190
"OK. order -- so this
came from up here.",00:19:38.190,00:19:41.340
"And similarly, if I try to put
the right inverse on the left",00:19:41.340,00:19:45.610
--,00:19:45.610,00:19:48.380
"so that, like, came from above.",00:19:48.380,00:19:51.840
"This, coming from
this side, what",00:19:51.840,00:19:53.810
"happens if I try to put the
right inverse on the left?",00:19:53.810,00:19:56.620
"Then I would have A transpose
A, A transpose inverse A,",00:19:56.620,00:20:05.090
"if this matrix is
now on the left, what",00:20:05.090,00:20:08.350
do you figure that matrix is?,00:20:08.350,00:20:09.880
"It's going to be a
projection, too, right?",00:20:09.880,00:20:17.390
"It looks very much
like this guy,",00:20:17.390,00:20:19.090
"except the only difference
is, A and A transpose",00:20:19.090,00:20:22.400
have been reversed.,00:20:22.400,00:20:24.100
"So this is a projection,
this is another projection,",00:20:24.100,00:20:27.960
onto the row space.,00:20:27.960,00:20:29.710
"Again, it's trying
to be the identity,",00:20:33.520,00:20:35.850
"but there's only so
much the matrix can do.",00:20:35.850,00:20:39.980
"And this is the projection
onto the column space.",00:20:39.980,00:20:44.580
"So let me now go back
to the main picture",00:20:44.580,00:20:50.600
"and tell you about the general
case, the pseudo-inverse.",00:20:50.600,00:20:55.600
These are cases we know.,00:20:55.600,00:20:58.060
So this was important review.,00:20:58.060,00:21:01.500
"You've got to know the
business about these ranks,",00:21:01.500,00:21:08.480
and the free variables --,00:21:08.480,00:21:11.350
"really, this is linear
algebra coming together.",00:21:11.350,00:21:14.960
"And, you know, one nice
thing about teaching 18.06,",00:21:14.960,00:21:19.130
It's not trivial.,00:21:19.130,00:21:23.260
But it's --,00:21:23.260,00:21:25.610
"I don't know, somehow, it's
nice when it comes out right.",00:21:25.610,00:21:28.590
"I mean -- well, I shouldn't say
anything bad about calculus,",00:21:28.590,00:21:31.360
but I will.,00:21:31.360,00:21:33.050
"I mean, like, you
know, you have formulas",00:21:33.050,00:21:35.150
"for surface area, and other
awful things and, you know,",00:21:35.150,00:21:40.190
"they do their best in
calculus, but it's not elegant.",00:21:40.190,00:21:46.580
"And, linear algebra just
is -- well, you know,",00:21:46.580,00:21:52.300
"linear algebra is about
the nice part of calculus,",00:21:52.300,00:21:54.770
"where everything's, like, flat,
and, the formulas come out",00:21:54.770,00:22:00.880
right.,00:22:00.880,00:22:01.830
"And you can go into
high dimensions",00:22:01.830,00:22:04.040
"where, in calculus,
you're trying",00:22:04.040,00:22:06.820
"to visualize these things,
well, two or three dimensions",00:22:06.820,00:22:09.780
is kind of the limit.,00:22:09.780,00:22:10.810
"But here, we don't --",00:22:10.810,00:22:12.430
"you know, I've stopped
doing two-by-twos,",00:22:12.430,00:22:16.280
"I'm just talking about
the general case.",00:22:16.280,00:22:18.160
"OK, now I really will speak
about the general case here.",00:22:18.160,00:22:22.430
What could be the inverse --,00:22:22.430,00:22:27.810
"what's a kind of
reasonable inverse",00:22:27.810,00:22:29.910
"for a matrix for the
completely general matrix where",00:22:29.910,00:22:34.070
"there's a rank r, but
it's smaller than n,",00:22:34.070,00:22:38.410
"so there's some null space
left, and it's smaller",00:22:38.410,00:22:41.680
"than m, so a transpose
has some null space,",00:22:41.680,00:22:44.930
"and it's those null spaces
that are screwing up inverses,",00:22:44.930,00:22:48.430
right?,00:22:48.430,00:22:49.650
"Because if a matrix
takes a vector to zero,",00:22:49.650,00:22:53.090
"well, there's no way an inverse
can, like, bring it back",00:22:53.090,00:23:01.390
to life.,00:23:01.390,00:23:03.240
"My topic is now
the pseudo-inverse,",00:23:03.240,00:23:05.810
"and let's just by a
picture, see what's",00:23:05.810,00:23:09.190
the best inverse we could have?,00:23:09.190,00:23:11.170
"So, here's a vector
x in the row space.",00:23:11.170,00:23:15.820
I multiply by A.,00:23:15.820,00:23:18.170
"Now, the one thing everybody
knows is you take a vector,",00:23:18.170,00:23:22.050
"you multiply by A,
and you get an output,",00:23:22.050,00:23:25.360
and where is that output?,00:23:25.360,00:23:28.220
Where is Ax?,00:23:28.220,00:23:31.090
"Always in the
column space, right?",00:23:31.090,00:23:35.050
"Ax is a combination
of the columns.",00:23:35.050,00:23:37.750
So Ax is somewhere here.,00:23:37.750,00:23:39.310
"So I could take all the
vectors in the row space.",00:23:42.800,00:23:46.750
I could multiply them all by A.,00:23:46.750,00:23:49.400
"I would get a bunch of
vectors in the column space",00:23:49.400,00:23:53.870
"and what I think is, I'd get all
the vectors in the column space",00:23:53.870,00:23:59.280
just right.,00:23:59.280,00:24:00.670
"I think that this
connection between an x",00:24:00.670,00:24:03.440
"in the row space and an Ax
in the column space, this",00:24:03.440,00:24:07.257
is one-to-one.,00:24:07.257,00:24:07.840
"We got a chance, because
they have the same",00:24:12.160,00:24:14.170
dimension.,00:24:14.170,00:24:15.150
"That's an r-dimensional
space, and that's",00:24:15.150,00:24:17.480
an r-dimensional space.,00:24:17.480,00:24:20.060
"And somehow, the matrix A --",00:24:20.060,00:24:22.970
"it's got these null
spaces hanging around,",00:24:22.970,00:24:27.260
where it's knocking vectors to,00:24:27.260,00:24:30.820
"And then it's got all the
vectors in between, zero.",00:24:30.820,00:24:33.510
which is almost all vectors.,00:24:33.510,00:24:35.190
"Almost all vectors have
a row space component",00:24:35.190,00:24:38.460
and a null space,00:24:38.460,00:24:39.250
component.,00:24:39.250,00:24:39.950
"And it's killing the
null space component.",00:24:39.950,00:24:42.880
"But if I look at the vectors
that are in the row space,",00:24:42.880,00:24:45.690
"with no null space component,
just in the row space,",00:24:45.690,00:24:48.740
"then they all go into
the column space,",00:24:48.740,00:24:51.110
"so if I put another vector,
let's say, y, in the row space,",00:24:51.110,00:24:55.340
"I positive that wherever
Ay is, it won't hit Ax.",00:24:55.340,00:25:02.730
Do you see what I'm saying?,00:25:02.730,00:25:04.680
Let's see why.,00:25:04.680,00:25:05.830
All right.,00:25:09.340,00:25:09.840
So here's what I said.,00:25:09.840,00:25:12.600
"If x and y are in the
row space, then A x",00:25:12.600,00:25:23.430
is not the same as A y.,00:25:23.430,00:25:27.650
"They're both in the
column space, of course,",00:25:27.650,00:25:30.110
but they're different.,00:25:30.110,00:25:31.210
"That would be a perfect
question on a final exam,",00:25:36.690,00:25:39.780
"because that's what
I'm teaching you",00:25:39.780,00:25:45.360
"in that material
of chapter three",00:25:45.360,00:25:48.690
"and chapter four,
especially chapter three.",00:25:48.690,00:25:53.920
"If x and y are in the row space,
then Ax is different from Ay.",00:25:53.920,00:25:58.430
So what this means --,00:25:58.430,00:26:01.280
and we'll see why --,00:26:01.280,00:26:03.630
"is that, in words, from the
row space to the column space,",00:26:03.630,00:26:09.000
"A is perfect, it's
an invertible matrix.",00:26:09.000,00:26:12.980
"If we, like, limited
it to those spaces.",00:26:12.980,00:26:16.700
"And then, its
inverse will be what",00:26:16.700,00:26:19.930
I'll call the pseudo-inverse.,00:26:19.930,00:26:21.290
"So that's that the
pseudo-inverse is.",00:26:21.290,00:26:23.770
"It's the inverse -- so A goes
this way, from x to y -- sorry,",00:26:23.770,00:26:28.940
"x to A x, from y to A y,
that's A, going that way.",00:26:28.940,00:26:35.340
"Then in the other direction,
anything in the column space",00:26:35.340,00:26:38.910
"comes from somebody
in the row space,",00:26:38.910,00:26:41.400
"and the reverse there is what
I'll call the pseudo-inverse,",00:26:41.400,00:26:45.010
"and the accepted
notation is A plus.",00:26:45.010,00:26:51.010
So y will be A plus x.,00:26:51.010,00:26:55.390
I'm sorry.,00:26:55.390,00:26:55.890
"No, y will be A plus times
whatever it started with, A y.",00:26:55.890,00:27:05.900
Do you see my picture there?,00:27:05.900,00:27:09.030
"Same, of course, for x and A x.",00:27:09.030,00:27:11.340
"This way, A does it, the other
way is the pseudo-inverse,",00:27:11.340,00:27:15.280
"and the pseudo-inverse
just kills this stuff,",00:27:15.280,00:27:18.430
and the matrix just kills this,00:27:18.430,00:27:20.360
stuff.,00:27:20.360,00:27:20.860
"So everything that's really
serious here is going",00:27:20.860,00:27:25.260
"on in the row space and
the column space, and now,",00:27:25.260,00:27:27.840
tell me --,00:27:27.840,00:27:31.550
"this is the fundamental
fact, that between those two",00:27:31.550,00:27:34.910
"r-dimensional spaces,
our matrix is perfect.",00:27:34.910,00:27:37.560
Why?,00:27:40.900,00:27:41.400
Suppose they weren't.,00:27:44.960,00:27:47.180
Why do I get into trouble?,00:27:47.180,00:27:49.230
"Suppose -- so, proof.",00:27:49.230,00:27:51.780
"I haven't written
down proof very much,",00:27:51.780,00:27:54.090
"but I'm going to
use that word once.",00:27:54.090,00:27:57.640
Suppose they were the same.,00:27:57.640,00:28:00.710
"Suppose these are supposed
to be two different vectors.",00:28:00.710,00:28:07.990
"Maybe I'd better make
the statement correctly.",00:28:07.990,00:28:10.540
"If x and y are different
vectors in the row space --",00:28:10.540,00:28:13.930
"maybe I'll better put if
x is different from y,",00:28:13.930,00:28:20.790
both in the row space --,00:28:20.790,00:28:23.370
"so I'm starting with two
different vectors in the row",00:28:23.370,00:28:25.620
"space, I'm multiplying by A --
so these guys are in the column",00:28:25.620,00:28:29.900
"space, everybody knows
that, and the point is,",00:28:29.900,00:28:33.520
they're different over there.,00:28:33.520,00:28:36.980
"So, suppose they weren't.",00:28:36.980,00:28:38.950
Suppose A x=A y.,00:28:38.950,00:28:40.570
"Suppose, well, that's the
same as saying A(x-y) is zero.",00:28:44.940,00:28:48.800
So what?,00:28:54.960,00:28:57.140
"So, what do I know
now about (x-y),",00:28:57.140,00:29:00.090
"what do I know
about this vector?",00:29:00.090,00:29:03.500
"Well, I can see right
away, what space is it in?",00:29:03.500,00:29:07.810
"It's sitting in the
null space, right?",00:29:07.810,00:29:10.390
So it's in the null space.,00:29:10.390,00:29:11.580
"But what else do
I know about it?",00:29:14.520,00:29:17.030
"Here it was x in the row
space, y in the row space,",00:29:17.030,00:29:20.950
what about x-y?,00:29:20.950,00:29:23.170
"It's also in the
row space, right?",00:29:23.170,00:29:29.870
"Heck, that thing
is a vector space,",00:29:29.870,00:29:32.030
"and if the vector space
is anything at all,",00:29:32.030,00:29:35.550
"if x is in the row space,
and y is in the row space,",00:29:35.550,00:29:38.610
"then the difference is also,
so it's also in the row space.",00:29:38.610,00:29:43.040
So what?,00:29:47.990,00:29:48.850
"Now I've got a vector x-y
that's in the null space,",00:29:48.850,00:29:52.420
"and that's also in the row
space, so what vector is it?",00:29:52.420,00:29:56.270
It's the zero vector.,00:29:56.270,00:29:58.380
"So I would conclude
from that that x-y",00:29:58.380,00:30:00.840
"had to be the zero vector,
x-y, so, in other words,",00:30:00.840,00:30:07.200
"if I start from two
different vectors,",00:30:07.200,00:30:09.120
I get two different vectors.,00:30:09.120,00:30:11.480
"If these vectors are the
same, then those vectors",00:30:11.480,00:30:14.020
had to be the same.,00:30:14.020,00:30:16.050
"That's like the algebra proof,
which we understand completely",00:30:16.050,00:30:21.600
"because we really understand
these subspaces of what",00:30:21.600,00:30:28.230
"I said in words, that
a matrix A is really",00:30:28.230,00:30:32.480
"a nice, invertible mapping
from row space to columns pace.",00:30:32.480,00:30:37.560
"If the null spaces
keep out of the way,",00:30:37.560,00:30:40.160
then we have an inverse.,00:30:40.160,00:30:43.200
"And that inverse is
called the pseudo inverse,",00:30:43.200,00:30:46.840
"and it's a very, very,
useful in application.",00:30:46.840,00:30:51.410
"Statisticians
discovered, oh boy, this",00:30:51.410,00:30:54.360

needed all our lives,",00:30:54.360,00:30:56.580
"and here it finally showed
up, the pseudo-inverse",00:30:56.580,00:30:59.100
is the right thing.,00:30:59.100,00:31:02.070
Why do statisticians need it?,00:31:02.070,00:31:04.300
"And because statisticians
are like least-squares-happy.",00:31:04.300,00:31:11.360
"I mean they're always
doing least squares.",00:31:11.360,00:31:14.440

central linear regression.",00:31:14.440,00:31:20.700

watch this on video,",00:31:20.700,00:31:22.920

provided we have full column",00:31:35.170,00:31:41.150
rank.,00:31:41.150,00:31:42.080

all the time about, oh, God,",00:31:42.080,00:31:46.810
"maybe we just repeated
an experiment.",00:31:46.810,00:31:49.900
"You know, you're taking
all these measurements,",00:31:49.900,00:31:52.220

not independent.",00:31:54.750,00:31:56.730
"Well, in that case, that
A transpose A matrix",00:31:56.730,00:32:00.910
"that they depend on
becomes singular.",00:32:00.910,00:32:04.230
"So then that's when they
needed the pseudo-inverse,",00:32:04.230,00:32:06.890
"it just arrived at
the right moment,",00:32:06.890,00:32:09.180
and it's the right quantity.,00:32:09.180,00:32:13.840
OK.,00:32:13.840,00:32:14.440

pseudo-inverse should do, let",00:32:14.440,00:32:21.590
me see what it is.,00:32:21.590,00:32:25.080

OK.,00:32:42.740,00:32:45.310
OK.,00:32:45.310,00:32:46.340
"Well, here's one way.",00:32:46.340,00:32:48.170
"Everything I do today is
to try to review stuff.",00:32:50.710,00:32:53.860
"One way would be to
start from the SVD.",00:32:53.860,00:33:00.770
"The Singular Value
Decomposition.",00:33:00.770,00:33:02.630

that that factored A",00:33:02.630,00:33:05.380
"into an orthogonal matrix
times this diagonal matrix",00:33:05.380,00:33:10.480
times this orthogonal matrix.,00:33:10.480,00:33:12.500

diagonal guy look like?",00:33:12.500,00:33:16.330
"This diagonal guy, sigma,
has some non-zeroes,",00:33:16.330,00:33:25.510
"and you remember, they
came from A transpose A,",00:33:25.510,00:33:28.280

are the good guys, and then",00:33:28.280,00:33:31.400
"some more zeroes, and all zeroes
there, and all zeroes there.",00:33:31.400,00:33:34.680

the pseudo-inverse is,",00:33:38.110,00:33:41.700

nice to invert -- well,",00:33:41.700,00:33:45.030

this beautiful diagonal matrix?",00:33:50.610,00:33:55.310

null space, right?",00:33:55.310,00:33:58.380

m rows, and it's got rank r.",00:34:10.780,00:34:21.000

have of our general setup.,00:34:23.989,00:34:28.089
OK?,00:34:31.179,00:34:31.699
So what's the pseudo-inverse?,00:34:31.699,00:34:36.800
What's the matrix --,00:34:36.800,00:34:39.020

the pseudo-inverse.",00:34:41.296,00:34:42.754

have to stop at sigma r.",00:35:08.760,00:35:13.340

pseudo-inverse is the best --",00:35:39.820,00:35:45.350
"is the closest I can
come to an inverse.",00:35:45.350,00:35:48.200

its pseudo-inverse?",00:35:48.200,00:35:53.220
"Can you multiply sigma
by its pseudo-inverse?",00:35:53.220,00:35:56.020

"Rectangular, of course.",00:36:07.280,00:36:10.200

going to get ones, R ones,",00:36:10.200,00:36:18.780
"and all the rest, zeroes.",00:36:18.780,00:36:20.590

whole matrix will be m by",00:36:20.590,00:36:24.420
m.,00:36:24.420,00:36:25.780

in the other order.",00:36:25.780,00:36:30.200

right underneath?",00:36:32.067,00:36:33.525

"It's not the same as that,
it's a different size --",00:37:14.670,00:37:19.020
it's a projection.,00:37:19.020,00:37:22.090
"One is a projection matrix
onto the column space,",00:37:22.090,00:37:25.560

"That's the best that
pseudo-inverse can do.",00:37:30.590,00:37:35.470

pseudo-inverse does is,",00:37:35.470,00:37:38.030
"if you multiply on the left,
you don't get the identity,",00:37:38.030,00:37:41.050

on the right, you",00:37:41.050,00:37:42.510
"don't get the identity, what
you get is the projection.",00:37:42.510,00:37:46.080
"It brings you into the two
good spaces, the row space",00:37:46.080,00:37:51.300
and column space.,00:37:51.300,00:37:52.760

out the null space.",00:37:52.760,00:37:55.240

pseudo-inverse of this diagonal",00:37:55.240,00:37:57.800
"one is, and then the
pseudo-inverse of A itself --",00:37:57.800,00:38:04.710
this is perfectly invertible.,00:38:04.710,00:38:06.290

of V transpose?",00:38:06.290,00:38:09.180
Just another tiny bit of review.,00:38:09.180,00:38:11.800

the trouble in it,",00:38:18.590,00:38:21.360

is responsible for,",00:38:21.360,00:38:25.940

a true inverse,",00:38:25.940,00:38:28.610

could write U inverse.",00:38:37.320,00:38:40.200

do you find the pseudo-inverse",00:38:40.200,00:38:43.640
--,00:38:43.640,00:38:45.110
"so what statisticians do
when they're in this --",00:38:45.110,00:38:49.350
"so this is like the case of
where least squares breaks down",00:38:49.350,00:38:54.980
"because the rank is --
you don't have full rank,",00:38:54.980,00:38:58.420
"and the beauty of the singular
value decomposition is,",00:38:58.420,00:39:05.020
"it puts all the problems into
this diagonal matrix where",00:39:05.020,00:39:09.620
it's clear what to do.,00:39:09.620,00:39:10.980
"It's the best inverse you
could think of is clear.",00:39:10.980,00:39:13.960
You see there could be other --,00:39:13.960,00:39:16.430
"I mean, we could put
some stuff down here,",00:39:16.430,00:39:18.720
it would multiply these zeroes.,00:39:18.720,00:39:20.980
"It wouldn't have any effect,
but then the good pseudo-inverse",00:39:20.980,00:39:27.270
"is the one with no extra
stuff, it's sort of, like,",00:39:27.270,00:39:33.290
as small as possible.,00:39:33.290,00:39:36.430
"It has to have those
to produce the ones.",00:39:36.430,00:39:41.040
"If it had other stuff, it
would just be a larger matrix,",00:39:41.040,00:39:46.260

of the minimal matrix that",00:39:46.260,00:39:51.050
gives the best result.,00:39:51.050,00:39:53.960
Sigma sigma plus being r ones.,00:39:53.960,00:39:57.250
SK.,00:39:57.250,00:39:59.710
so I guess I'm hoping --,00:39:59.710,00:40:03.122
"pseudo-inverse, again,
let me repeat what",00:40:03.122,00:40:04.830
I said at the very beginning.,00:40:04.830,00:40:06.038
"This pseudo-inverse,
which appears",00:40:09.080,00:40:11.990
"at the end, which is in
section seven point four,",00:40:11.990,00:40:17.700
"and probably I did more with
it here than I did in the book.",00:40:17.700,00:40:24.090
"The word pseudo-inverse will
not appear on an exam in this",00:40:24.090,00:40:28.460
"course, but I think if you
see this all will appear,",00:40:28.460,00:40:34.900
"because this is all what the
course was about, chapters one,",00:40:34.900,00:40:40.010
"two, three, four --",00:40:40.010,00:40:41.527
"but if you see all that,
then you probably see,",00:40:44.150,00:40:47.900
"well, OK, the general case
had both null spaces around,",00:40:47.900,00:40:51.810
"and this is the
natural thing to do.",00:40:51.810,00:40:56.470
"So, this is one way to
find the pseudo-inverse.",00:40:56.470,00:41:01.190
Yes.,00:41:01.190,00:41:03.500
"The point of a pseudo-inverse,
of computing a pseudo-inverse",00:41:03.500,00:41:07.260
"is to get some factors
where you can find",00:41:07.260,00:41:10.220
the pseudo-inverse quickly.,00:41:10.220,00:41:12.000
"And this is, like, the
champion, because this",00:41:12.000,00:41:15.720
"is where we can invert
those, and those two, easily,",00:41:15.720,00:41:20.850
"just by transposing, and we
know what to do with a diagonal.",00:41:20.850,00:41:26.560
"OK, that's as much
review, maybe --",00:41:26.560,00:41:33.210
"let's have a five-minute holiday
in 18.06 and, I'll see you",00:41:33.210,00:41:37.920
"Wednesday, then,
for the rest of this",00:41:37.920,00:41:40.060
course.,00:41:40.060,00:41:40.560
Thanks.,00:41:40.560,00:41:42.110
