"PATRICK WINSTON: I have
extremely bad news.",00:00:15.584,00:00:18.820
"Halloween falls this
year on a Sunday.",00:00:18.820,00:00:21.690
"But we in 6.034 refuse to
suffer the slings and arrows",00:00:21.690,00:00:25.880
of outrageous fortune.,00:00:25.880,00:00:27.890
"So we've decided that
Halloween is today,",00:00:27.890,00:00:30.291
as far 6.034 is concerned.,00:00:30.291,00:00:33.029
"Kenny, could you give
me a hand, please?",00:00:33.029,00:00:34.695
"If you could take that
and put it over there.",00:00:43.910,00:00:47.305
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?,00:00:47.305,00:00:49.002
PATRICK WINSTON: Mm hm.,00:00:49.002,00:00:49.960
Just give it to them.,00:00:49.960,00:00:51.210
"You can take as much
of this as you like.",00:00:54.120,00:00:56.990
"The rest will be given to that
herd of stampeding freshman",00:00:56.990,00:00:59.655
that comes in after.,00:00:59.655,00:01:00.905
"It's a cornucopia
of legal drugs.",00:01:16.039,00:01:21.000
"Chocolate does produce
a kind of mild high,",00:01:21.000,00:01:24.144
"and I recommend it before
quizzes and giving lectures.",00:01:24.144,00:01:30.890
"I have a friend of mine, one of
the Nobel laureates in biology,",00:01:30.890,00:01:33.754
"always eats chocolate
before he lectures.",00:01:33.754,00:01:36.060
Gives him a little edge.,00:01:36.060,00:01:38.750
"Otherwise, he'll be flat.",00:01:38.750,00:01:41.930
So I recommend it.,00:01:41.930,00:01:47.265
"It will take, I
suppose, a little while",00:01:54.200,00:01:55.848
to digest that neural net stuff.,00:01:55.848,00:01:59.020
"A little richer than
usual in mathematics.",00:01:59.020,00:02:02.891
"So today, we're going to
talk about another effort",00:02:02.891,00:02:04.974
at mimicking biology.,00:02:04.974,00:02:06.440
This is easy stuff.,00:02:09.217,00:02:11.550
It's just conceptual.,00:02:11.550,00:02:14.224
"And you won't see
this on the next quiz.",00:02:14.224,00:02:15.890
"But you will see
it on the final.",00:02:15.890,00:02:17.265
"It's one of those quiz
five type problems,",00:02:17.265,00:02:19.440
"where I ask you questions to
see if you were here and awake.",00:02:19.440,00:02:23.690
"So a typical question
might be, Professor Winston",00:02:23.690,00:02:27.250
"is a creationist, or
something like that.",00:02:27.250,00:02:31.540
Not too hard to answer.,00:02:31.540,00:02:34.290
"In any event, if it's been hard
to develop a real understanding",00:02:34.290,00:02:41.067
"of intelligence,
occasionally the hope",00:02:41.067,00:02:42.650
"is that by mimicking biology
or mimicking evolution,",00:02:42.650,00:02:47.152
"you can circumnavigate
all the problems.",00:02:47.152,00:02:53.640
"And one of those
kinds of efforts",00:02:53.640,00:02:55.306
is ever to imitate evolution.,00:02:55.306,00:02:59.740
"So we're going to talk
today about so called",00:02:59.740,00:03:02.035
"genetic algorithms,
which are naive attempts",00:03:02.035,00:03:06.840
to mimic naive evolution.,00:03:06.840,00:03:09.890
"Now, I realize that most MIT
students have a basic grasp",00:03:09.890,00:03:15.357
of sexual reproduction.,00:03:15.357,00:03:17.910
"But I've found in
talking with students",00:03:17.910,00:03:20.192
"that many times, they're
a little fuzzy on some",00:03:20.192,00:03:23.234
of the details.,00:03:23.234,00:03:24.270
"So let's start off by reflecting
a little bit about how",00:03:24.270,00:03:27.466
that works.,00:03:27.466,00:03:29.320
"So let's see, we
need pink and blue.",00:03:29.320,00:03:34.630
"And here's our cell,
and here is its nucleus,",00:03:34.630,00:03:39.400
"and here are mommy and
daddy's chromosomes.",00:03:39.400,00:03:42.590
"We'll just pretend
there's one pair.",00:03:42.590,00:03:45.770
"Now ordinarily, in ordinary cell
division, you get two cells.",00:03:45.770,00:03:53.440
"Both have a nucleus, and the
process of producing them",00:03:53.440,00:03:57.660
"involves the duplication
of those chromosomes.",00:03:57.660,00:04:01.310
"And then one pair ends up
in each of the child cells,",00:04:01.310,00:04:06.890
and that's all there is to that.,00:04:06.890,00:04:08.780
That's mitosis.,00:04:08.780,00:04:10.030
"But then, when we talk
about reproduction,",00:04:16.360,00:04:19.846
"it's more complicated
because those chromosomes",00:04:19.846,00:04:23.530
"get all twisted up, and they
break, and they recombine.",00:04:23.530,00:04:28.520
"So when we talk about
the cells that split off",00:04:28.520,00:04:31.690
"from one of these
germ cells, it's",00:04:31.690,00:04:35.885
"no longer appropriate to
talk about the pink one",00:04:35.885,00:04:40.576
"and the blue one, because
the pink one and the blue one",00:04:40.576,00:04:44.062
are all mixed up.,00:04:44.062,00:04:45.280
"So you get two chromosomes
here and two here.",00:04:45.280,00:04:49.640
"But through some miracle
of nature, which has always",00:04:49.640,00:04:52.920
"amazed me, these two
cells split, in turn,",00:04:52.920,00:04:57.664
into four cells altogether.,00:04:57.664,00:05:00.100
"And each of those four
cells at the bottom",00:05:05.340,00:05:08.688
"gets one of the
chromosomes that was",00:05:08.688,00:05:11.056
"produced by the twisting up
of the rope and recombination.",00:05:11.056,00:05:16.250
"Then, along comes
a special occasion.",00:05:16.250,00:05:23.090
"And now we can think of this
as being a blue one and this",00:05:23.090,00:05:29.390
as being a pink one.,00:05:29.390,00:05:31.480
"And they come together, and
you get a new person, like so.",00:05:31.480,00:05:38.440
"Note that your mother
and father's chromosomes",00:05:38.440,00:05:41.604
"are never, never recombined.",00:05:41.604,00:05:43.335
"It's your grandparents
chromosomes that recombine.",00:05:43.335,00:05:47.700
So that's what it's like.,00:05:47.700,00:05:48.995
"And the main thing
to note about this",00:05:48.995,00:05:50.536
"is-- well, a couple things.",00:05:50.536,00:05:51.660
"If you happen to be female,
this part of the process--",00:05:51.660,00:05:57.260
"this part over here-- took
place before you were born.",00:05:57.260,00:06:01.700
"If you happen to be male, it's
going on right now as we speak,",00:06:01.700,00:06:05.584
"which probably
explains something.",00:06:05.584,00:06:07.400
"But in any event, it's
going on right now.",00:06:07.400,00:06:10.930
"But whenever it
goes on, there are",00:06:10.930,00:06:14.360
"lots of opportunities
for throwing dice.",00:06:14.360,00:06:18.200
"So God threw all
the dice before you",00:06:18.200,00:06:20.656
"were born, if you
happen to be a female,",00:06:20.656,00:06:23.540
"in this part of the
process over here.",00:06:23.540,00:06:26.190
"Then, of course, more
dice got thrown here",00:06:26.190,00:06:28.302
"when the decision
was made about which",00:06:28.302,00:06:30.872
"particular cells got to fuse
to form a new individual.",00:06:30.872,00:06:35.280
"So I want to beat on this
idea of lots of choice.",00:06:35.280,00:06:38.890
"When we talk about
genetic algorithms,",00:06:38.890,00:06:40.996
"and we talk about nature, there
are lots of choices in there.",00:06:40.996,00:06:44.409
"And that means there
are lots of choices",00:06:44.409,00:06:46.689
"to intervene, to screw around,
to make things work out",00:06:46.689,00:06:50.483
the way you want.,00:06:50.483,00:06:52.159
"But in any event, there we are.",00:06:52.159,00:06:54.120
"That's the basic idea, and it
all starts with chromosomes.",00:06:54.120,00:06:58.040
"So we could think of
implementing something",00:06:58.040,00:07:00.084
"that imitates that
with the ACTG stuff",00:07:00.084,00:07:03.590
"that you learned all
about in Seminar 1.",00:07:03.590,00:07:07.030
But we're computer scientists.,00:07:07.030,00:07:08.480
We don't like Base 4.,00:07:08.480,00:07:10.616
We like Base 2.,00:07:10.616,00:07:11.240
"So I'm going to just suggest
that our chromosomes are binary",00:07:11.240,00:07:14.714
"in this system that
we're going to build.",00:07:14.714,00:07:17.870
So that might be a chromosome.,00:07:21.230,00:07:23.590
"And it doesn't
have to be binary.",00:07:23.590,00:07:26.280
"It can be symbolic
for fall I care.",00:07:26.280,00:07:27.890
"But it's just some
string of things",00:07:27.890,00:07:30.613
"that determine how the
ultimate system behaves.",00:07:30.613,00:07:35.390
"So it all starts out, then,
with some of these chromosomes,",00:07:35.390,00:07:39.665
"some of these
simulated chromosomes,",00:07:39.665,00:07:46.840
"simulated,
simplified, and naive.",00:07:46.840,00:07:51.070
"And there's a population
of chromosomes.",00:07:51.070,00:07:55.570
"The population of
chromosomes-- it",00:07:55.570,00:07:57.145
"might be subject to a
little bit of mutation.",00:07:57.145,00:08:00.010
"That is to say, a zero becomes
a one, or a one becomes a zero.",00:08:00.010,00:08:05.379
That happens a lot.,00:08:05.379,00:08:06.170
"That mutation stuff
happens over here",00:08:06.170,00:08:07.711
"when things get twisted
up and recombined.",00:08:07.711,00:08:09.940
"There are copying
errors and stuff.",00:08:09.940,00:08:12.020
Cosmic rays hit it all the time.,00:08:12.020,00:08:13.600
"All sorts of reasons
why there might",00:08:13.600,00:08:15.511
be a single point of change.,00:08:15.511,00:08:18.090
"That produces the
mutation effect.",00:08:18.090,00:08:21.970
"So here, we have a population
that starts off over here.",00:08:21.970,00:08:32.360
"And some of those things
are subject to mutation.",00:08:32.360,00:08:34.929
"And you'll note, here's a
whole bunch of choice already.",00:08:37.976,00:08:41.429
"How many of these mutations
do you allow per chromosome,",00:08:41.429,00:08:45.610
for example?,00:08:45.610,00:08:48.330
"How many of the chromosomes
just slip through",00:08:48.330,00:08:50.402
without any mutation?,00:08:50.402,00:08:51.280
Those are choices you can make.,00:08:51.280,00:08:53.640
"Once you've made
those choices, then we",00:08:53.640,00:08:55.334
have the crossover phenomenon.,00:08:55.334,00:08:57.070
"Let's identify one of these
guys as the pink one and one",00:09:01.990,00:09:05.600
of these guys as the blue one.,00:09:05.600,00:09:08.820
"And so now we have the
pink one cruised along",00:09:08.820,00:09:12.380
as well as the blue one.,00:09:12.380,00:09:14.730
"The pink one and the blue
one cross and produce",00:09:14.730,00:09:17.130
"a new chromosome,
just like in nature.",00:09:17.130,00:09:20.820
"So we take the front part of
one, back part of the other,",00:09:20.820,00:09:23.720
and we fuse them together.,00:09:23.720,00:09:26.760
"And some may slip by without
any of that, like so.",00:09:26.760,00:09:32.470
"Well, these things are meant to
be combined in pairs, like so,",00:09:32.470,00:09:36.247
"but they may not have
any crossover in them.",00:09:36.247,00:09:38.942
"So you have another
set of choices.",00:09:38.942,00:09:40.400
"How many crossovers do you
allow per recombination?",00:09:40.400,00:09:44.790
You get another set of choices.,00:09:44.790,00:09:47.190
"So now we've got a population
of modified chromosomes",00:09:47.190,00:09:53.280
through mutation and crossover.,00:09:53.280,00:09:54.630
"So the next thing to do
is we have the genotype",00:09:54.630,00:09:58.359
to phenotype transition.,00:09:58.359,00:10:00.520
"That is to say the chromosome
determines the individual.",00:10:00.520,00:10:03.660
It may be a person.,00:10:03.660,00:10:05.250
It may be a cow.,00:10:05.250,00:10:06.030
It may be a computer program.,00:10:06.030,00:10:07.290
I don't care what.,00:10:07.290,00:10:08.830
"But that code down
there has to be",00:10:08.830,00:10:12.150
interpreted to be a something.,00:10:12.150,00:10:15.670
"So it is the
genotype, and it has",00:10:15.670,00:10:17.734
"to be interpreted to
be something which",00:10:17.734,00:10:20.104
"is the phenotype, the thing
that the stuff down there is",00:10:20.104,00:10:25.830
encoding for.,00:10:25.830,00:10:26.810
"So here, we have a
bunch of individuals.",00:10:26.810,00:10:29.955
"Now, each of those
individuals, because they",00:10:32.840,00:10:34.751
"have varying
chromosomal composition,",00:10:34.751,00:10:36.629
will have a different fitness.,00:10:36.629,00:10:39.480
"So these fitnesses
might be-- well,",00:10:42.380,00:10:45.152
"who knows how they
might be scored.",00:10:45.152,00:10:46.990
But we're computer scientists.,00:10:46.990,00:10:48.362
We might as well use numbers.,00:10:48.362,00:10:49.570
"So maybe this guy's
fitness is 88,",00:10:49.570,00:10:51.551
"and this guy's fitness
is 77, and so on.",00:10:51.551,00:10:57.359
So now that we've got fitness--,00:10:57.359,00:10:58.650
"by the way, notice
all the choices",00:11:01.290,00:11:02.837
"involved there-- choice
of how you interpret",00:11:02.837,00:11:04.845
"the genotype, choice about
how the phenotype produces",00:11:04.845,00:11:08.330
the fitness.,00:11:08.330,00:11:09.610
"And now we have a choice
about how the fitness produces",00:11:09.610,00:11:13.152
"a probability, like 0.8
and 0.1, or something",00:11:13.152,00:11:19.976
"like that--
probability of survival",00:11:19.976,00:11:23.406
into the next generation.,00:11:23.406,00:11:25.333
"So now, once we've got
those probabilities,",00:11:25.333,00:11:27.124
we actually have selection.,00:11:27.124,00:11:28.840
"And those phenotypes out
there produce genotypes,",00:11:32.250,00:11:35.309
"a new set of
chromosomes, and that",00:11:35.309,00:11:39.404
"completes our loop that
goes back in there.",00:11:39.404,00:11:43.830
"And so that's the
new generation.",00:11:43.830,00:11:45.630
Sounds simple.,00:11:51.650,00:11:54.440
"So if you're going to
make this work, of course,",00:11:54.440,00:11:56.540
"you have a million
choices, as I'm",00:11:56.540,00:11:58.205
"going to emphasize
over and over again.",00:11:58.205,00:11:59.950
"And one of your choices
is, for example, how",00:11:59.950,00:12:04.261
"do you compute the
probability of survival",00:12:04.261,00:12:06.570
"to the next generation
given the fitness?",00:12:06.570,00:12:10.440
"So we have to go, somehow,
from numbers like these",00:12:10.440,00:12:13.440
to probabilities like those.,00:12:13.440,00:12:16.830
"So I'm going to talk about
several ways of doing it.",00:12:16.830,00:12:20.270
None of them are magic.,00:12:20.270,00:12:21.920
"None of them was specified
and stipulated by God",00:12:21.920,00:12:24.420
as the right way.,00:12:24.420,00:12:26.110
"But they have increasingly
good properties with respect",00:12:26.110,00:12:28.630
to this kind of processing.,00:12:28.630,00:12:31.950
"So the simplest thing
you can do-- idea number",00:12:31.950,00:12:35.806
"one for computing
the-- see, what you do",00:12:35.806,00:12:39.624
"is you get this whole
bag of individuals,",00:12:39.624,00:12:41.946
"and you have to decide
who's going to survive",00:12:41.946,00:12:43.820
to the next generation.,00:12:43.820,00:12:45.800
"So at each step,
everything in the bank",00:12:45.800,00:12:48.208
"has a probability of being
the one you pick out and put",00:12:48.208,00:12:51.380
in the next generation.,00:12:51.380,00:12:52.370
"So at any step, the sum
of the probabilities",00:12:52.370,00:12:54.701
"for each of those guys
is 1, because that's",00:12:54.701,00:12:57.922
how high probability works.,00:12:57.922,00:12:59.330
"The probability of a
complete set, added all up,",00:12:59.330,00:13:02.759
is probability of 1.,00:13:02.759,00:13:05.700
"So one thing you
can do is you can",00:13:05.700,00:13:08.238
"say that the
probability that you're",00:13:08.238,00:13:10.318
"going to draw individual
i is equal to,",00:13:10.318,00:13:14.110
"or maybe is proportional to,
the fitness of that individual.",00:13:14.110,00:13:18.710
"I haven't completed
the expression,",00:13:24.467,00:13:25.925
"so it's not a probability
yet, because some piece of it",00:13:25.925,00:13:29.169
won't add up to 1.,00:13:29.169,00:13:31.010
"How can I ensure that
it will add up to 1?",00:13:31.010,00:13:34.370
That's easy.,00:13:34.370,00:13:34.940
Right.,00:13:34.940,00:13:36.280
"All I have to do is
divide by the sum",00:13:36.280,00:13:39.490
of the fitnesses over i.,00:13:39.490,00:13:43.180
"So there's a probability
measure that's",00:13:43.180,00:13:45.490
produced from the fitnesses.,00:13:45.490,00:13:46.690
Yeah.,00:13:46.690,00:13:47.549
"STUDENT: You need to make
sure that the fitnesses aren't",00:13:47.549,00:13:49.882
negative.,00:13:49.882,00:13:50.338
"PATRICK WINSTON: Have to make
sure the fitnesses are what?",00:13:50.338,00:13:51.780
STUDENT: Aren't negative.,00:13:51.780,00:13:52.712
"PATRICK WINSTON: He
says I have to make",00:13:52.712,00:13:54.216
"sure the fitnesses
aren't negative.",00:13:54.216,00:13:55.674
"Yeah, it would be
embarrassing if they were.",00:13:55.674,00:13:59.020
"So we'll just truncate
anything like that as 0.",00:13:59.020,00:14:01.465
"You've got a lot of choice how
you can calculate the fitness.",00:14:01.465,00:14:04.153
"And maybe you will produce
negative numbers, in which case",00:14:04.153,00:14:06.569
"you have to think a
little bit more about it.",00:14:06.569,00:14:08.964
"So now, what about an example?",00:14:11.570,00:14:13.410
"Well, I'm going to
show you an example.",00:14:13.410,00:14:16.880
"Why don't I show
you the example.",00:14:16.880,00:14:19.450
"What we're going to
do is we're going",00:14:19.450,00:14:21.042
"to have a genetic
algorithm that looks",00:14:21.042,00:14:22.671
for an optimal value in a space.,00:14:22.671,00:14:24.615
And there's the space.,00:14:27.870,00:14:29.836
"Now, you'll notice it's
a bunch of contour lines,",00:14:29.836,00:14:32.554
a bunch of hills in that space.,00:14:32.554,00:14:34.840
"Let me show you how
that space was produced.",00:14:34.840,00:14:38.170
"The fitness is a
function of x and y,",00:14:38.170,00:14:42.076
"and it's equal to the sine of
some constant times x, quantity",00:14:42.076,00:14:48.898
"squared, times the sine of some
constant y, quantity squared,",00:14:48.898,00:14:55.545
"e to the plus x plus y
divided by some constant.",00:14:55.545,00:15:01.910
"So sigma and omega
there are just in there",00:15:01.910,00:15:04.619
"so that it kind of makes a
nice picture for demonstration.",00:15:04.619,00:15:09.890
So there's a space.,00:15:09.890,00:15:10.790
"And clearly, where you
want to be in this space",00:15:10.790,00:15:12.748
"is in the upper
right-hand corner.",00:15:12.748,00:15:16.670
That's the optimal value.,00:15:16.670,00:15:18.160
"But we have a genetic algorithm
that doesn't know anything.",00:15:18.160,00:15:21.300
"All it knows how to do
is mutate and cross over.",00:15:21.300,00:15:26.950
"So it's going to start off
with a population of 1.",00:15:26.950,00:15:30.130
"It's a little red dot
down in the lower left.",00:15:30.130,00:15:33.130
"So here's how it's
going to evolve.",00:15:33.130,00:15:36.080
"There's going to be s
chromosome consisting",00:15:36.080,00:15:38.796
"of two numbers, an x
number and a y number,",00:15:38.796,00:15:43.844
"like, say, 0.3 and 0.7.",00:15:43.844,00:15:47.450
"Here's another one, which
might be 0.6 and 0.2.",00:15:47.450,00:15:53.839
"So the mutation
operator is going",00:15:53.839,00:15:55.214
"to take one of those values
and change it a little bit.",00:15:55.214,00:15:58.720
"So it might say, well, we'll
take 3, and we'll make it 0.2.",00:15:58.720,00:16:03.980
"And the crossover
operation is going",00:16:03.980,00:16:05.534
"to exchange the x and
y values of pairs.",00:16:05.534,00:16:08.850
"So if we have a
crossover here, then what",00:16:08.850,00:16:11.343
"we're going to get out
from this one-- well,",00:16:11.343,00:16:16.271
"we're going to get out a
combination of these two.",00:16:16.271,00:16:18.390
"And it's going to
look like this.",00:16:22.970,00:16:31.171
"Because what we're
going to do is we're",00:16:31.171,00:16:32.796
"going to take the x value of
1 and combine it with the y",00:16:32.796,00:16:35.909
value of the other one.,00:16:35.909,00:16:37.120
"So this is going to be 0.2--
my mutated value and 0.2--",00:16:37.120,00:16:42.050
"and this is going
to be 0.6 and 0.7.",00:16:42.050,00:16:46.420
"So that's how my little
genetic algorithm",00:16:46.420,00:16:48.660
heck is going to work.,00:16:48.660,00:16:51.860
"So having coded this up, we
can now see how it flows.",00:16:51.860,00:16:56.090
Let's run it 10 generations.,00:17:01.000,00:17:04.460
"So the population is rapidly
expanded to some fixed limit.",00:17:04.460,00:17:07.565
I forgot what it is--,00:17:07.565,00:17:08.440
30 or so.,00:17:08.440,00:17:10.440
"And we can run that
100 generations.",00:17:10.440,00:17:15.260
"And so this seems to be
getting stuck, kind of, right?",00:17:15.260,00:17:18.540
So what's the problem?,00:17:18.540,00:17:20.319
The problem is local maxima.,00:17:20.319,00:17:21.858
"This is fundamentally a
hill climbing mechanism.",00:17:21.858,00:17:30.950
"Note that I have not included
any crossover so far.",00:17:30.950,00:17:33.350
"So if I do have
crossover, then if I've",00:17:36.210,00:17:38.379
"got a good x value
and a good y value,",00:17:38.379,00:17:41.511
"I can cross them
over and get them",00:17:41.511,00:17:44.855
both in the same situation.,00:17:44.855,00:17:48.370
"But nevertheless,
this thing doesn't",00:17:48.370,00:17:49.870
seem to be working very well.,00:17:49.870,00:17:51.783
"STUDENT: Professor,
I have a question.",00:17:51.783,00:17:53.635
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah.,00:17:53.635,00:17:54.561
"STUDENT: That picture is
just the contour lines",00:17:54.561,00:17:56.303
of that function.,00:17:56.303,00:17:56.660
"PATRICK WINSTON: The contour
lines of that function.",00:17:56.660,00:17:58.570
"So the reason you see
a lot of contour lines",00:17:58.570,00:18:00.210
"in the upper right
is because it gets",00:18:00.210,00:18:01.695
"much higher because there's that
exponential term that increases",00:18:01.695,00:18:04.361
as you go up to the right.,00:18:04.361,00:18:06.430
"So I don't know, it looks--
let's put some crossover in",00:18:06.430,00:18:11.060
and repeat the experience.,00:18:11.060,00:18:12.500
We'll run 100 generations.,00:18:15.960,00:18:24.019
I don't know.,00:18:24.019,00:18:24.560
"It just doesn't seem
to be going anywhere.",00:18:24.560,00:18:27.440
"Sometimes, it'll go right
to the global maximum.",00:18:27.440,00:18:31.760
Sometimes it takes a long time.,00:18:31.760,00:18:33.120
"It's got a random number
generator in there,",00:18:33.120,00:18:34.953
so I have no control over it.,00:18:34.953,00:18:37.610
So it's going to get there.,00:18:37.610,00:18:39.520
"I couldn't tell
whether the crossover",00:18:39.520,00:18:41.068
was doing any good or not.,00:18:41.068,00:18:43.236
"Oh, well, here's one.",00:18:43.236,00:18:47.030
"Let's make this a little
bit more complicated.",00:18:47.030,00:18:49.970
Suppose that's the space.,00:18:49.970,00:18:51.220
"Now it's going to
be in real trouble,",00:19:02.767,00:19:04.308
"because it'll never
get across that moat.",00:19:04.308,00:19:06.140
"You know, you would think
that it would climb up",00:19:09.280,00:19:13.320
"to the x maximum or
to the y maximum,",00:19:13.320,00:19:16.100
"but it's not going
to do very well.",00:19:16.100,00:19:19.720
"Even with crossover,
it's just not",00:19:19.720,00:19:21.136
"going to do very
well, because it's",00:19:21.136,00:19:22.680
climbing up those local hills.,00:19:22.680,00:19:24.130
"Anybody got an idea
about one simple thing",00:19:24.130,00:19:26.186
"we could do to make
it work better?",00:19:26.186,00:19:30.100
"Yeah, you could increase
step size, right?",00:19:30.100,00:19:34.735
"Let me you see if
that will help.",00:19:34.735,00:19:36.110
"You know, even that
doesn't seem to help.",00:19:49.360,00:19:51.750
"So we have to conclude--
do we conclude",00:19:51.750,00:19:54.366
that this is a bad idea?,00:19:54.366,00:19:55.520
"Well, we don't have to
conclude it's a bad idea yet,",00:19:55.520,00:19:58.170
"because we may just look at
it and ask why five times.",00:19:58.170,00:20:04.420
"And we might ask,
well, maybe we can",00:20:04.420,00:20:07.500
"get a better mechanism in
there to translate fitness",00:20:07.500,00:20:10.392
into probability of survival.,00:20:10.392,00:20:11.600
"Using this formula is
kind of strange, anyway,",00:20:14.540,00:20:17.148
"because suppose temperature
is one of your fitness",00:20:17.148,00:20:20.244
characteristics.,00:20:20.244,00:20:20.910
"The hotter, the better.",00:20:20.910,00:20:22.520
"Then the ratio of
the probability",00:20:22.520,00:20:24.608
"that you'll survive
versus the person",00:20:24.608,00:20:27.278
"next to you, that
ratio will depend on",00:20:27.278,00:20:30.142
"whether you're measuring
the temperature in Celsius",00:20:30.142,00:20:32.266
"or Fahrenheit, right?",00:20:32.266,00:20:35.680
"Because you've
shifted the origin",00:20:35.680,00:20:37.420
"that shifts the
ratio that shifts",00:20:37.420,00:20:39.850
the probability of success.,00:20:39.850,00:20:41.772
"So it seems kind of strange to
just take these things right",00:20:41.772,00:20:44.230
straight into probabilities.,00:20:44.230,00:20:46.550
"So a better idea--
idea number two--",00:20:46.550,00:20:49.430
"is to say, well,
shoot, maybe we don't",00:20:49.430,00:20:51.910
"care about what the
actual fitnesses are.",00:20:51.910,00:20:55.730
"All we really care
about is the rank order",00:20:55.730,00:20:58.295
of all the candidates.,00:20:58.295,00:21:00.428
"So the candidate
with the most fitness",00:21:00.428,00:21:02.011
"will have the most
probability of getting",00:21:02.011,00:21:04.112
into the next generation.,00:21:04.112,00:21:05.770
"The candidate with the
second most fitness",00:21:05.770,00:21:07.856
"will have the second highest
probability, and so on.",00:21:07.856,00:21:11.794
"But we're not going to use the
actual fitnesses themselves",00:21:11.794,00:21:14.210
to make the determination.,00:21:14.210,00:21:16.154
"Instead, what we're going to
do with this mechanism number",00:21:16.154,00:21:18.570
"two-- this is the
rank space method--",00:21:18.570,00:21:20.390
is this.,00:21:28.670,00:21:29.370
"We're going to say that the
probability of the highest",00:21:29.370,00:21:32.166
"ranking individual of getting
into the next generation",00:21:32.166,00:21:35.860
"is some constant P sub c, which,
of course, you can select.",00:21:35.860,00:21:39.720
You have another choice.,00:21:39.720,00:21:42.350
"Then, if that guy
doesn't get selected,",00:21:42.350,00:21:45.479
"the probability of the second
highest ranking individual",00:21:45.479,00:21:48.300
"getting in the
next generation is",00:21:48.300,00:21:49.938
"going to be the probability that
that guy didn't get in there.",00:21:49.938,00:21:53.620
"That's 1 minus P sub c times
the same probability constant.",00:21:53.620,00:21:59.870
"And so you can see
how this is going.",00:21:59.870,00:22:02.360
"P3 will be equal to 1 minus P
sub c squared terms P sub c.",00:22:02.360,00:22:10.220
"P sub n minus 1
will be equal to 1",00:22:10.220,00:22:16.300
"minus that probability constant
to the n minus-- n minus 2",00:22:16.300,00:22:24.494
times P sub c.,00:22:24.494,00:22:27.370
"And then there's only
one individual left.",00:22:27.370,00:22:30.771
"And then if you got
through all these guys",00:22:30.771,00:22:32.521
"and haven't got
anybody selected,",00:22:32.521,00:22:33.896
"then you've got to
select the last guy.",00:22:33.896,00:22:37.260
"And so the probability you're
going to select the last guy",00:22:37.260,00:22:40.640
"is going to be 1 minus P
sub c to the n minus 1.",00:22:40.640,00:22:47.160

you've missed all those guys",00:22:47.160,00:22:50.409

thinking it ought to be 1?",00:23:10.592,00:23:13.080
"STUDENT: No, I was thinking that
I was wondering why you were re",00:23:13.080,00:23:17.858
"rolling the dice, so to speak.",00:23:17.858,00:23:19.460
"PATRICK WINSTON: You
are re rolling the dice.",00:23:19.460,00:23:20.700
"You've got a
probability each time,",00:23:20.700,00:23:22.038
"except for the last time, when,
of course, you have to take it.",00:23:22.038,00:23:24.630
There's nothing left.,00:23:24.630,00:23:25.200
There's no other choice.,00:23:25.200,00:23:26.050
STUDENT: I have a question.,00:23:26.050,00:23:27.130
"PATRICK WINSTON:
Yeah, [? Lunnare ?]..",00:23:27.130,00:23:28.713
"STUDENT: So when you jump
from P sub 1 to P sub 2,",00:23:28.713,00:23:32.337
that makes sense.,00:23:32.337,00:23:33.244
"P sub 2 to P sub 3 you're
saying that the probability",00:23:33.244,00:23:35.453
"PATRICK WINSTON:
It's the probability",00:23:35.453,00:23:36.994
"depends on the
first two choices.",00:23:36.994,00:23:38.421
"STUDENT: Yeah, but
the second choice",00:23:38.421,00:23:39.363
"had probability one minus P
sub c times P sub c, not--",00:23:39.363,00:23:41.613
"PATRICK WINSTON: Think
about it this way.",00:23:41.613,00:23:43.410
"It's the probability you
didn't choose the first two.",00:23:43.410,00:23:46.030
"So the probability you
didn't choose the first one",00:23:46.030,00:23:48.113
is one minus P sub c.,00:23:48.113,00:23:49.127
"The probability you didn't
choose the next one, as well,",00:23:49.127,00:23:51.460
"because you're choosing that
next one with probability P sub",00:23:51.460,00:23:53.994
"c, it's the square of it.",00:23:53.994,00:23:56.385
So that might work better.,00:23:59.180,00:24:00.760
Let's give it a shot.,00:24:00.760,00:24:03.220
"Let's go back to our
original space choice,",00:24:03.220,00:24:08.516
"and we set and switch to
the rank fitness method.",00:24:08.516,00:24:14.800
"And we'll run out
100 generations.",00:24:14.800,00:24:19.200
Whoa!,00:24:19.200,00:24:21.437
What happened there?,00:24:21.437,00:24:22.270
That was pretty fast.,00:24:22.270,00:24:23.360
Maybe I used a big step size.,00:24:23.360,00:24:24.850
"Yeah, that's a little
bit more reasonable.",00:24:28.400,00:24:30.150
Oops-- what happened?,00:24:30.150,00:24:33.036
"It's really getting
stuck on a local maximum.",00:24:33.036,00:24:34.910
"So evidently, I've choosed
a constant P sub c such",00:24:39.560,00:24:43.560
"that it just drove it
right up the nearest hill.",00:24:43.560,00:24:48.340
"On the other hand, if I change
the step size a little bit,",00:24:48.340,00:24:50.960
"maybe I can get
it to spread out.",00:24:50.960,00:24:53.690
I sure did.,00:24:53.690,00:24:55.170
"And now that it's
managed to evolve over",00:24:55.170,00:24:57.586
"there to find the
maximum value, now I",00:24:57.586,00:25:00.872
"can clamp down on
the step size again.",00:25:00.872,00:25:05.020
"And now it shows
no more diversity.",00:25:05.020,00:25:06.730
"It's just locked on to
that global maximum.",00:25:06.730,00:25:10.190
"So this is not unlike what
evolution sometimes does.",00:25:10.190,00:25:13.450
"Sometimes, species
collapse into a state",00:25:16.190,00:25:19.442
"where they don't change for 500
million or 600 million years,",00:25:19.442,00:25:22.950
"like sharks, for example.",00:25:22.950,00:25:24.670
"Sometimes, they only
survive if they've",00:25:28.092,00:25:29.716
"got a lot of diversity
built into their way of life",00:25:29.716,00:25:33.321
"so that they can adjust
to habitat changes.",00:25:33.321,00:25:37.750
"Now, when you increase
the step size,",00:25:37.750,00:25:39.689
"because you're stuck
on a local maximum,",00:25:39.689,00:25:42.065
it's like heating up a metal.,00:25:42.065,00:25:44.245
"You make everything
kind of vibrate",00:25:44.245,00:25:46.610
"more, make bigger steps.",00:25:46.610,00:25:49.230
"So this kind of process, where
you may start with a big step",00:25:49.230,00:25:53.100
"size and then gradually
reduce the step size,",00:25:53.100,00:25:56.340
"is called simulated
annealing, because it's",00:25:56.340,00:25:59.370
like letting a metal cool down.,00:25:59.370,00:26:02.000
"So you start off with a
big temperature-- big step",00:26:02.000,00:26:04.550
size-- that covers the space.,00:26:04.550,00:26:06.940
"And then you slowly
reduce the step size,",00:26:06.940,00:26:09.452
"so you actually crawl
up to the local maxima",00:26:09.452,00:26:14.024
that are available.,00:26:14.024,00:26:15.502
"So that seemed to
work pretty well.",00:26:15.502,00:26:16.960
"Let's see if we can get
it to work on the harder",00:26:16.960,00:26:19.880
problem of the moat.,00:26:19.880,00:26:21.130
So it's not doing very well.,00:26:32.890,00:26:34.820
Better increase the step size.,00:26:34.820,00:26:36.270
"No, it's still kind of stuck.",00:26:41.260,00:26:42.510
"Even though it's got the
capacity to cross over,",00:26:45.030,00:26:47.361
"it's so stuck on that
lower right hand corner,",00:26:47.361,00:26:49.532
"it can't get up that vertical
branch to get to a point",00:26:49.532,00:26:52.570
"where a crossover will
produce a value up there",00:26:52.570,00:26:55.435
in the upper right-hand corner.,00:26:55.435,00:26:57.040
So we're still not home yet.,00:26:57.040,00:26:58.445
So what's the trouble?,00:27:03.570,00:27:05.350
"The trouble is that the fitness
mechanism is just driving",00:27:05.350,00:27:10.918
things up to the local maximum.,00:27:10.918,00:27:14.090
It's just terribly unfortunate.,00:27:14.090,00:27:16.025
What to do?,00:27:20.840,00:27:21.510
"Well, here's something
you could do.",00:27:21.510,00:27:23.010
"You can say, well,
if the problem is",00:27:23.010,00:27:25.330
"we've lost the diversity
in our population,",00:27:25.330,00:27:27.942
"then we can measure
the diversity-- not",00:27:27.942,00:27:31.309
"only the fitness of
the set of individuals",00:27:31.309,00:27:33.301
"we're selecting from, but we
can measure how different they",00:27:33.301,00:27:37.028
"are on the individuals
we've already selected",00:27:37.028,00:27:38.902
for the next population.,00:27:38.902,00:27:41.750
"In other words, we can get a
diverse population as well as",00:27:41.750,00:27:44.890
"a fit population if, when
we make our selection,",00:27:44.890,00:27:47.266
"we consider not
only their fitness",00:27:47.266,00:27:49.170
"but how different they are
from the individuals that",00:27:49.170,00:27:52.600
have already been selected.,00:27:52.600,00:27:54.290
"So that's going to be
mechanism number three.",00:27:54.290,00:27:56.250
"So now we have a space,
and we can measure fitness",00:28:07.410,00:28:13.450
"along one axis-- ordinary
fitness-- and this is",00:28:13.450,00:28:18.280
"rank space fitness, so
that's going to be P sub c.",00:28:18.280,00:28:21.026
"There will always
be some individual",00:28:21.026,00:28:24.150
with the highest fitness.,00:28:24.150,00:28:25.520
"And over here-- that might
not be P sub c, actually.",00:28:31.680,00:28:35.935
"But there'll be some individual
with a maximal fitness,",00:28:35.935,00:28:38.226
"and at any given
step in the selection",00:28:38.226,00:28:40.834
"of the next population, there'll
be some individual that's",00:28:40.834,00:28:44.328
"maximally diverse from all
of the individuals that",00:28:44.328,00:28:49.286
"have been selected for the
next generation so far.",00:28:49.286,00:28:55.300
"So what kind of
individual would you",00:28:55.300,00:28:56.945
"like to pick for
the next generation?",00:28:56.945,00:29:00.470
"Well, the one with
the highest fitness",00:29:00.470,00:29:02.885
"rank and the one with the
highest diversity rank.",00:29:02.885,00:29:07.250
"So what you'd really
like is you'd like",00:29:07.250,00:29:10.218
to have somebody right there.,00:29:10.218,00:29:14.397
"And if you can't have
somebody right there,",00:29:14.397,00:29:16.188
"if there's nobody right
there with a maximum fitness,",00:29:16.188,00:29:19.740
"a maximum diversity
at the same time, then",00:29:19.740,00:29:23.235
"maybe you can draw in
iso goodness lines,",00:29:23.235,00:29:26.437
"like so, which are just how
far you are from that ideal.",00:29:26.437,00:29:32.510
So let's summarize.,00:29:32.510,00:29:34.174
"You've got to pick
some individuals",00:29:34.174,00:29:35.632
for the next population.,00:29:35.632,00:29:37.165
"When we pick the
first individual,",00:29:37.165,00:29:39.187
"all we've got to
go on is how fit",00:29:39.187,00:29:42.050
"the individual is,
because there's nobody",00:29:42.050,00:29:43.933
else in that next generation.,00:29:43.933,00:29:45.800
"After the first
individual is selected,",00:29:45.800,00:29:48.428
"then we can look at
our set of candidates,",00:29:48.428,00:29:51.636
"and we can say which
candidate would",00:29:51.636,00:29:53.420
"be more different from the
set of things we've already",00:29:53.420,00:29:55.670
selected than all the others.,00:29:55.670,00:29:56.878
"That would get the highest
diversity rank and so on down",00:29:56.878,00:30:00.180
the candidate list.,00:30:00.180,00:30:02.150
"So let's see how
that might work.",00:30:02.150,00:30:03.630
"So we're going to use a
combination of fitness",00:30:11.330,00:30:14.075
rank and diversity rank.,00:30:14.075,00:30:18.990
"And we'll just use
the simple one so far.",00:30:18.990,00:30:21.880
"We'll use a small
step size, and we'll",00:30:21.880,00:30:24.000
"let this run 100 generations
to see what happens.",00:30:24.000,00:30:26.530
Bingo.,00:30:31.570,00:30:32.830
"It crawls right up there,
because it's trying",00:30:32.830,00:30:34.704
to keep itself spread out.,00:30:34.704,00:30:36.520
"It uses that diversity
measurement to do that.",00:30:36.520,00:30:39.372
"And at the same time,
it's seeking high fitness,",00:30:39.372,00:30:43.206
"so that's why it's crawling up
to the upper right hand corner.",00:30:43.206,00:30:46.250
"But in the end, that
diversity piece of it",00:30:46.250,00:30:49.184
"is keeping the
things spread out.",00:30:49.184,00:30:52.026
"So suppose you're a
shark or something.",00:30:52.026,00:30:53.650
"You don't care about
diversity anymore,",00:30:53.650,00:30:55.275
And we could just turn that off.,00:30:55.275,00:30:57.440
Is that thing still running?,00:30:57.440,00:30:58.700
Go back to fitness rank-- bingo.,00:31:03.460,00:31:06.500
"So there you are-- you're
stuck for 600 million years.",00:31:06.500,00:31:11.917
"So let's see if this will
handle the moat problem.",00:31:11.917,00:31:14.000
"See, our step size
is still small.",00:31:24.420,00:31:27.870
We'll just let this run.,00:31:27.870,00:31:31.110
"So the diversity of P sub
is keeping it spread out,",00:31:31.110,00:31:34.520
"pretty soon, bingo,
it's right in there.",00:31:34.520,00:31:36.976
"It's across that big moat,
because it's got the crossover",00:31:36.976,00:31:39.350
"mechanism that combines the
best of the x's and the best",00:31:39.350,00:31:41.740
of the y's.,00:31:41.740,00:31:43.570
"So that seems to
work pretty well.",00:31:43.570,00:31:47.830
"OK, so see, these are
some of the things",00:31:47.830,00:31:50.296
"that you can think about
when you're thinking-- oh,",00:31:50.296,00:31:52.985
"and of course,
we're a shark, we're",00:31:52.985,00:31:55.214
going to forget about diversity.,00:31:55.214,00:31:56.830
"We'll change the
selection method",00:31:56.830,00:31:58.780
"from fitness and diversity
rank to just diversity.",00:31:58.780,00:32:01.245
"It collapses down on
to the highest hill.",00:32:01.245,00:32:04.060
"Yeah, [? Feedball ?], what?",00:32:07.650,00:32:09.225
"STUDENT: How does step size
translate into mutations?",00:32:09.225,00:32:12.865
"PATRICK WINSTON: Oh,
just the-- question",00:32:12.865,00:32:15.552
"is, how does step size
translate into mutation?",00:32:15.552,00:32:19.250
"Instead of allowing myself
to take steps as big as 1/10,",00:32:19.250,00:32:22.517
"I might allow myself to
take steps as big as 3/10,",00:32:22.517,00:32:27.680
according to some distribution.,00:32:27.680,00:32:29.190
So what to say about all this?,00:32:32.430,00:32:33.680
"It's very seductive,
because it's nature, right?",00:32:36.630,00:32:40.000
"The trouble is,
it's naive nature.",00:32:40.000,00:32:42.610
"And as evolutionary theories
go, this is horrible.",00:32:42.610,00:32:49.280
This is naive.,00:32:49.280,00:32:51.082
"So we'd like to use real
evolutionary theory,",00:32:51.082,00:32:52.956
"except we don't have
real evolutionary theory.",00:32:52.956,00:32:55.360
Evolution is still a mystery.,00:32:55.360,00:32:57.780
Some things are pretty obvious.,00:32:57.780,00:33:00.170
You can breed fast race horses.,00:33:00.170,00:33:02.490
That works just like so.,00:33:02.490,00:33:04.450
"The trouble is, we don't have
any real good idea about how",00:33:04.450,00:33:07.200
"speciation takes place
and how a lot of evolution",00:33:07.200,00:33:11.655
"works, because all these
chromosomes are connected",00:33:11.655,00:33:14.646
"to their phenotype consequences
in very complicated ways",00:33:14.646,00:33:18.330
that nobody fully understands.,00:33:18.330,00:33:21.110
"So there's a great deal
of magic in that genotype",00:33:21.110,00:33:23.380
"to phenotype transition
that nobody really",00:33:23.380,00:33:26.580
understands very well.,00:33:26.580,00:33:28.950
"So when people write
these programs that",00:33:28.950,00:33:32.590
"are in the style of so
called genetic algorithm,",00:33:32.590,00:33:38.170
"they're taking a photograph
of high school biology,",00:33:38.170,00:33:43.050
"and they're spending a
long time building programs",00:33:43.050,00:33:46.820
based on that naive idea.,00:33:46.820,00:33:48.920
"But that naive idea has lots
of places for intervention,",00:33:48.920,00:33:54.430
"because look at all the
things you can screw around",00:33:54.430,00:33:57.920
"with in that process of
going from one generation",00:33:57.920,00:34:01.056
to the next.,00:34:01.056,00:34:02.100
"By the way, what
does mutation do?",00:34:04.671,00:34:07.110
"It's basically hill
climbing, right?",00:34:07.110,00:34:09.020
"It's producing a
little spread out,",00:34:09.020,00:34:10.478
"and you're using the fitness
thing to climb the hill.",00:34:10.478,00:34:14.131
"So you get a lot of choices
about how you handle that.",00:34:14.131,00:34:16.380
"Then you get a lot of
choices about much crossover",00:34:16.380,00:34:17.893
you're doing.,00:34:17.893,00:34:18.434
What does crossover do?,00:34:18.434,00:34:20.275
"It kind of combines
strong features",00:34:20.275,00:34:24.331
"of multiple individuals
into one individual, maybe.",00:34:24.331,00:34:27.469
"So you've got all
kinds of choices there.",00:34:30.310,00:34:32.079
"And then your genotype to
phenotype translation--",00:34:32.079,00:34:34.120
"how do you interpret
something like those zeroes",00:34:34.120,00:34:36.968
"and ones as an if then rule,
for example, as something that's",00:34:36.968,00:34:40.029
in the hands of the designer?,00:34:40.029,00:34:42.969
"Then you've got all the rest
of those things, all which",00:34:42.969,00:34:46.401
are left up to the designer.,00:34:46.401,00:34:48.940
"So in the end, you
really have to ask--",00:34:48.940,00:34:50.763
"when you see an impressive
demonstration, you have to say,",00:34:50.763,00:34:53.179
where does the credit lie?,00:34:53.179,00:34:55.179
"And I mean that
pun intentionally,",00:34:55.179,00:34:57.807
"because usually the people
who are claiming the credit",00:34:57.807,00:35:00.174
"are lying about where
it's coming from.",00:35:00.174,00:35:03.050
"But nevertheless,
let me give you",00:35:03.050,00:35:04.424
"a couple of examples
of where this",00:35:04.424,00:35:06.906
"has found actual, bona
fide practical application.",00:35:06.906,00:35:13.632
"So when you look for
practical application,",00:35:13.632,00:35:15.423
"you might say, well,
in what kind of problem",00:35:15.423,00:35:18.558
"does a good front piece
combine with a good back piece",00:35:18.558,00:35:22.088
to produce a good thing overall?,00:35:22.088,00:35:25.640
"And the answer is, when
you're making a plan.",00:35:25.640,00:35:28.860
"So you might have a
problem in planning",00:35:28.860,00:35:31.620
"that requires you to
take a series of steps.",00:35:31.620,00:35:35.045
"And you might have two
plans, each of which",00:35:39.860,00:35:43.380
is a series of steps.,00:35:43.380,00:35:45.500
"And you might combine these to
produce something new that's",00:35:45.500,00:35:51.470
"the front half of one and
the back half of another.",00:35:51.470,00:35:56.710
"So that's practical
application number one.",00:35:56.710,00:35:58.680
"And that requires you to
interpret your chromosome",00:36:01.750,00:36:04.910
"as an indicator of
the steps in the plan.",00:36:04.910,00:36:09.250
"Another example is drawn
from a UROP project",00:36:09.250,00:36:16.609
"a student did for
me some years ago.",00:36:16.609,00:36:18.445
He was a freshman.,00:36:20.920,00:36:21.670
"He came to me and said, I
want to do a UROP project.",00:36:21.670,00:36:24.235
"And I said, have
you taken 6.034?",00:36:24.235,00:36:26.320
And he said no.,00:36:26.320,00:36:27.290
"And I said, go away.",00:36:27.290,00:36:28.359
"And he said, I don't
want to go away.",00:36:28.359,00:36:29.900
I want to do a UROP project.,00:36:29.900,00:36:31.720
"So I said, have
you read my book?",00:36:31.720,00:36:34.000
He said no.,00:36:34.000,00:36:34.634
"I said, well, go away, then.",00:36:34.634,00:36:35.800
"And he said, I don't
want to go away.",00:36:35.800,00:36:37.341
I want to do a UROP project.,00:36:37.341,00:36:39.030
"So I said, I don't
have any UROP projects.",00:36:39.030,00:36:40.860
"He said, that's OK.",00:36:40.860,00:36:41.651
I've got my own.,00:36:41.651,00:36:42.810
"He's a finance
type guy, so he was",00:36:46.610,00:36:49.074
"interested in whether he
could build a rule based",00:36:49.074,00:36:52.460
"expert system that could predict
the winners at horse races.",00:36:52.460,00:36:57.680
"So his rule based expert system
consisted of rules like this.",00:36:57.680,00:37:04.750
"If x and y, then
some conclusion.",00:37:04.750,00:37:11.650
"If l and m, then some
kind of conclusion.",00:37:11.650,00:37:19.560
"And from these, he
would produce rules",00:37:19.560,00:37:23.207
"like if x prime-- that's
a slightly mutated version",00:37:23.207,00:37:27.692
"of the x antecedent-- and
m, then some conclusion.",00:37:27.692,00:37:38.080
So it's mutation and crossover.,00:37:38.080,00:37:39.630
"And he was able to
produce a system that",00:37:39.630,00:37:42.276
"seemed to work about as
well as the handicappers",00:37:42.276,00:37:45.439
in the newspaper.,00:37:45.439,00:37:46.580
"So he started losing
money at a less fast rate.",00:37:46.580,00:37:51.090
"He is now doing something in
the stock market, they say.",00:37:51.090,00:37:55.660
"Doesn't talk so much
about it, though.",00:37:55.660,00:37:59.164
But an interesting application.,00:37:59.164,00:38:01.380
"He came up with rules
like, if the sum",00:38:01.380,00:38:03.918
"of the jockey's weight on
the post position is low,",00:38:03.918,00:38:08.626
that's good.,00:38:08.626,00:38:09.820
"Well, that makes
sense in the end,",00:38:09.820,00:38:11.395
"because the jockey's
weight is always",00:38:11.395,00:38:12.958
"between 100 and 110 pounds,
and the post position is always",00:38:12.958,00:38:16.038
"between 1 and 10 or
something, so they",00:38:16.038,00:38:17.930
were commensurate values.,00:38:17.930,00:38:20.000
"And a low one is good, in fact.",00:38:20.000,00:38:21.996
Not bad.,00:38:21.996,00:38:24.430
But neither of those--,00:38:24.430,00:38:26.100
"I mean, this is real stuff.",00:38:26.100,00:38:28.590
"My company uses this sort of
stuff to do some planning work.",00:38:28.590,00:38:33.760
"But neither of those is as
impressive as the demonstration",00:38:33.760,00:38:38.044
"I'm about to show
you that involves",00:38:38.044,00:38:41.222
the evolution of creatures.,00:38:41.222,00:38:44.710
"And these creatures consist of
block like objects, like so.",00:38:44.710,00:38:50.580
"And they combine
like this, and so on.",00:38:50.580,00:38:54.390
"And so how can
you make a feature",00:38:54.390,00:38:56.758
like that from a 0 1 chromosome?,00:38:56.758,00:38:59.050
"Well, some of the
bits in the chromosome",00:38:59.050,00:39:02.354
"are interpreted as
the number of objects.",00:39:02.354,00:39:05.660
"Others are interpreted as
the sizes of the objects.",00:39:05.660,00:39:08.920
"Others are interpreted
as the structure of how",00:39:08.920,00:39:11.040
the objects are articulated.,00:39:11.040,00:39:14.080
"And still others are interpreted
as fixing the control algorithm",00:39:14.080,00:39:19.830
by which the creature operates.,00:39:19.830,00:39:23.380
"So you see how
that roughly goes?",00:39:23.380,00:39:26.010
"Would you like to see a
film of that in action?",00:39:26.010,00:39:29.060
Yes.,00:39:29.060,00:39:29.931
OK.,00:39:29.931,00:39:30.430
"[? Solo ?] always
likes to see the films.",00:39:30.430,00:39:32.138
"STUDENT: How would you measure
diversity in that graph?",00:39:42.890,00:39:46.421
"PATRICK WINSTON:
The question is,",00:39:46.421,00:39:47.796
"how do I measure the
diversity of the graph?",00:39:47.796,00:39:50.050
"I did it the same way
I measured the fitness.",00:39:50.050,00:39:52.610
"That is to say, I
calculated the distance--",00:39:52.610,00:39:56.560
"the actual metric distance--
of all the candidates",00:39:56.560,00:39:59.582
"for the next generation from
all of the candidates that",00:39:59.582,00:40:02.403
had already been selected.,00:40:02.403,00:40:03.610
I summed that up.,00:40:03.610,00:40:05.602
"And from that sum,
I could rank them",00:40:05.602,00:40:07.296
"according to how
different they were",00:40:07.296,00:40:08.796
"from the individuals that were
already in the next generation.",00:40:08.796,00:40:11.760
"It's like giving a rank,
and then from the rank,",00:40:11.760,00:40:13.840
"I use that kind of calculation
to determine a fitness, ie,",00:40:13.840,00:40:18.072
"a probability of
survival, and then",00:40:18.072,00:40:19.530
"I just combine the two
kinds of probabilities.",00:40:19.530,00:40:21.466
"STUDENT: So you always
kept-- every time",00:40:21.466,00:40:23.139
"that you selected
something, you cached those.",00:40:23.139,00:40:25.290
"And you kept everything
that you've ever",00:40:25.290,00:40:27.145
selected [INAUDIBLE].,00:40:27.145,00:40:28.019
"PATRICK WINSTON: I'm always
using the individuals that",00:40:28.019,00:40:30.314
"have already been
selected at every step,",00:40:30.314,00:40:32.022
"so every step is
a little different",00:40:32.022,00:40:33.479
"because it's working with
a new set of individuals",00:40:33.479,00:40:35.072
"that have already been selected
for the next generation.",00:40:35.072,00:40:37.405
OK?,00:40:37.405,00:40:38.990
So let's see how this works.,00:40:38.990,00:40:40.240
"So this is showing the evolution
of some swimming creatures.",00:40:49.080,00:40:53.367
"And they're evolved according
to how well they can swim,",00:40:53.367,00:40:55.700
how fast they can go.,00:40:55.700,00:40:57.932
"Some of them have quite exotic
mechanisms, and some of them",00:40:57.932,00:41:00.390
quite natural.,00:41:00.390,00:41:01.220
"That looked like a sperm
cell floating away there.",00:41:01.220,00:41:04.770
"Once you have these things
evolving, then of course,",00:41:09.119,00:41:11.285
"you can get groups of
them to evolve together.",00:41:11.285,00:41:13.820
"So you saw already some
that were evolving to swim.",00:41:19.640,00:41:24.160
"These are evolving to
move around on the land.",00:41:24.160,00:41:28.270
"It's interesting-- this was done
by Karl Sims, who at the time",00:41:28.270,00:41:32.872
"was at a then thriving
company, Thinking Machines,",00:41:32.872,00:41:35.208
a fresh spinoff from MIT.,00:41:35.208,00:41:37.320
"So he was using a vastly
parallel computer,",00:41:37.320,00:41:40.768
"super powerful for its day,
thousands of processors,",00:41:40.768,00:41:43.247
to do this.,00:41:43.247,00:41:44.191
"And it was a demonstration
of what you could",00:41:44.191,00:41:46.024
do with lots of computing.,00:41:46.024,00:41:48.330
"In the early stages of
the experimentation,",00:41:48.330,00:41:51.445
"though, its notion of physics
wasn't quite complete,",00:41:51.445,00:41:54.092
"so some of the creatures evolved
to move by hitting themselves",00:41:54.092,00:41:57.430
"in the chest and not knowing
about the conservation",00:41:57.430,00:42:01.900
of momentum.,00:42:01.900,00:42:03.000
I thought that was just great.,00:42:03.000,00:42:04.645
"So here they are, out
doing some further--",00:42:09.130,00:42:10.880
"So you look at these,
and you say, wow,",00:42:27.190,00:42:29.071
there must be something to this.,00:42:29.071,00:42:30.630
This is interesting.,00:42:30.630,00:42:32.120
These are complicated.,00:42:32.120,00:42:33.370
"I think this is one of the ones
that was trained, initially,",00:42:40.650,00:42:43.208
"to swim and then to
do land locomotion.",00:42:43.208,00:42:45.440
"So eventually, Karl
got around to thinking",00:42:50.760,00:42:54.519
"about how to make these
things evolve so that they",00:42:54.519,00:42:58.602
would compete for food.,00:42:58.602,00:42:59.890
"That's the fastest,
I think, by the way,",00:43:02.960,00:43:05.152
of the land locomotors.,00:43:05.152,00:43:08.630
"So that was training them
to-- evolving them to jump.",00:43:08.630,00:43:11.990
"This is evolving them to
follow a little red dot.",00:43:11.990,00:43:17.680
"Some of them have stumbled
upon quite exotic methods,",00:43:17.680,00:43:21.487
as you can see.,00:43:21.487,00:43:23.160
"Seem to be flailing
around, but somehow",00:43:26.380,00:43:29.096
"manage to-- sort of like
watching people take a quiz.",00:43:29.096,00:43:32.590
Making progress on it.,00:43:36.680,00:43:37.930
"But now we're on to
the food competition.",00:43:42.427,00:43:44.135
"So some of them go for
the food, and some of them",00:44:05.590,00:44:07.870
"go to excluding their
opponent from the food,",00:44:07.870,00:44:10.912
"not actually caring too much
about whether they get it.",00:44:10.912,00:44:13.670
That's sort of what children do.,00:44:13.670,00:44:15.850
"There's a kind of
hockey player-- now,",00:44:32.110,00:44:35.187
here's two hockey players.,00:44:35.187,00:44:36.270
Watch this.,00:44:36.270,00:44:37.944
"They're kind of-- one
succeeds-- it reminds me",00:44:37.944,00:44:46.749
"a little bit of hockey,
rugby, something like that.",00:44:46.749,00:44:49.970
"Sometimes, they just
get kind of confused,",00:44:49.970,00:44:53.071
"go right after their opponent,
forgetting about the food.",00:44:53.071,00:44:55.901
Gives up.,00:45:11.800,00:45:15.260
"I think these are the overall
winners in this elimination",00:45:15.260,00:45:20.771
contest.,00:45:20.771,00:45:21.740
I can't quite get there.,00:45:21.740,00:45:24.170
"OK, so you look at that, and
you say, wow, that's cool.",00:45:24.170,00:45:26.840
"Genetic algorithms
must be the way to go.",00:45:26.840,00:45:30.322
"I remember the first
time I saw this film.",00:45:30.322,00:45:32.790
It was over in Kresge.,00:45:32.790,00:45:33.790
"I was walking out of the
auditorium with Toma Poggio",00:45:33.790,00:45:37.930
"And we looked at each other,
and we said the same thing",00:45:37.930,00:45:41.500
simultaneously.,00:45:41.500,00:45:44.180
"We didn't say that genetic
algorithms were the way to go.",00:45:44.180,00:45:47.500
"What we said was, wow, that
space is rich in solutions.",00:45:47.500,00:45:52.520
"What we were amazed
by was not that simple",00:45:52.520,00:45:54.822
"minded genetic algorithms
produced solutions",00:45:54.822,00:45:56.655
"but that the space was
so rich with solutions",00:45:56.655,00:45:59.676
"that almost any mechanism
that was looking around",00:45:59.676,00:46:02.128
in that space would find them.,00:46:02.128,00:46:03.625
"But there's yet another
way of thinking about it,",00:46:03.625,00:46:05.666
"and that is you could say, wow,
look at how smart Karl Sims is,",00:46:05.666,00:46:10.270
"because Karl Sims is the
one who had his hands on all",00:46:10.270,00:46:12.682
"the levers, all those choices.",00:46:12.682,00:46:15.050
"And I kept emphasizing,
all those choices",00:46:15.050,00:46:17.780
"that enabled him to trick
this thing, in some sense,",00:46:17.780,00:46:21.953
"into stumbling across the
solutions in a space that",00:46:21.953,00:46:24.752
"was guaranteed to be

of all, diversity is good.",00:46:27.750,00:46:31.270

ingenuity of the programmer",00:46:43.500,00:46:46.065
