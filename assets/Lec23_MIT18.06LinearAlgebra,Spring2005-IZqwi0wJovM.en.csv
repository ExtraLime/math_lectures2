"-- and lift-off on
differential equations.",00:00:00.000,00:00:11.590
"So, this section is
about how to solve",00:00:11.590,00:00:16.660
"a system of first order,
first derivative, constant",00:00:16.660,00:00:22.760
coefficient linear equations.,00:00:22.760,00:00:26.500
"And if we do it right, it turns
directly into linear algebra.",00:00:26.500,00:00:32.740
"The key idea is the solutions
to constant coefficient",00:00:32.740,00:00:37.690
"linear equations
are exponentials.",00:00:37.690,00:00:41.730
"So if you look for
an exponential,",00:00:41.730,00:00:44.520
"then all you have to find is
what's up there in the exponent",00:00:44.520,00:00:48.230
"and what multiplies
the exponential",00:00:48.230,00:00:51.060
and that's the linear algebra.,00:00:51.060,00:00:53.130
"So -- and the result --
one thing we will fine --",00:00:53.130,00:00:56.950
"it's completely parallel
to powers of a matrix.",00:00:56.950,00:01:01.380
"So the last lecture was
about how would you compute",00:01:01.380,00:01:06.090
A to the K or A to the 100?,00:01:06.090,00:01:08.680
"How do you compute high
powers of a matrix?",00:01:08.680,00:01:12.120
"Now it's not powers anymore,
but it's exponentials.",00:01:12.120,00:01:18.590
"That's the natural thing
for differential equation.",00:01:18.590,00:01:22.310
Okay.,00:01:22.310,00:01:22.810
But can I begin with an example?,00:01:22.810,00:01:26.730
"And I'll just go
through the mechanics.",00:01:26.730,00:01:28.630
"How would I solve
the differential --",00:01:28.630,00:01:31.700
two differential equations?,00:01:31.700,00:01:33.707
So I'm going to make it --,00:01:33.707,00:01:34.790
"I'll have a two by two
matrix and the coefficients",00:01:34.790,00:01:38.160
"are minus one two, one minus
two and I'd better give you",00:01:38.160,00:01:42.530
some initial condition.,00:01:42.530,00:01:44.200
"So suppose it starts u at
times zero -- this is u1, u2 --",00:01:44.200,00:01:50.570
let it -- let it --,00:01:50.570,00:01:52.810
"suppose everything is
in u1 at times zero.",00:01:52.810,00:01:57.150
"So -- at -- at the
start, it's all in u1.",00:01:57.150,00:02:00.890
"But what happens as time
goes on, du2/dt will --",00:02:00.890,00:02:07.640
"will be positive,
because of that u1 term,",00:02:07.640,00:02:10.690
"so flow will move into the u2
component and it will go out",00:02:10.690,00:02:16.210
of the u1 component.,00:02:16.210,00:02:19.050
"So we'll just follow
that movement as time",00:02:19.050,00:02:22.330
"goes forward by looking at the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors",00:02:22.330,00:02:28.260
of that matrix.,00:02:28.260,00:02:30.220
That's a first job.,00:02:30.220,00:02:31.430
"Before you do anything
else, find the --",00:02:31.430,00:02:34.210
"find the matrix and its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.",00:02:34.210,00:02:39.510
So let me do that.,00:02:39.510,00:02:42.400
Okay.,00:02:42.400,00:02:43.060
So here's our matrix.,00:02:43.060,00:02:45.440
"Maybe you can tell
me right away what --",00:02:45.440,00:02:47.500
"what are the eigenvalues
and -- eigenvalues anyway.",00:02:47.500,00:02:53.190
And then we can check.,00:02:53.190,00:02:54.640
"But can you spot any of the
eigenvalues of that matrix?",00:02:54.640,00:02:58.070
"We're looking for
two eigenvalues.",00:02:58.070,00:03:00.900
Do you see --,00:03:00.900,00:03:02.090
"I mean, if I just wrote
that matrix down, what --",00:03:02.090,00:03:04.530
what do you notice about it?,00:03:04.530,00:03:07.670
"It's singular, right.",00:03:07.670,00:03:09.490
"That -- that's a
singular matrix.",00:03:09.490,00:03:11.380
"That tells me right away
that one of the eigenvalues",00:03:11.380,00:03:14.190
is lambda equals zero.,00:03:14.190,00:03:18.860
"I can -- that's a
singular matrix,",00:03:18.860,00:03:20.900
"the second column is minus
two times the first column,",00:03:20.900,00:03:25.440
"the determinant is zero,
it's -- it's singular,",00:03:25.440,00:03:28.600
"so zero is an eigenvalue and
the other eigenvalue will be --",00:03:28.600,00:03:33.670
from the trace.,00:03:33.670,00:03:35.640
"I look at the
trace, the sum down",00:03:35.640,00:03:37.510
the diagonal is minus three.,00:03:37.510,00:03:39.620
"That has to agree with
the sum of the eigenvalue,",00:03:39.620,00:03:42.770
"so that second eigenvalue
better be minus three.",00:03:42.770,00:03:46.970
"I could, of course --",00:03:46.970,00:03:48.610
"I could compute -- why
don't I over here --",00:03:48.610,00:03:51.100
"compute the determinant
of A minus lambda I,",00:03:51.100,00:03:54.530
"the determinant of this minus
one minus lambda two one minus",00:03:54.530,00:04:01.220
two minus lambda matrix.,00:04:01.220,00:04:03.680
But we know what's coming.,00:04:03.680,00:04:05.930
"When I do that multiplication,
I get a lambda squared.",00:04:05.930,00:04:09.700
"I get a two lambda and a one
lambda, that's a three lambda.",00:04:09.700,00:04:14.200
"And then -- now I'm going
to get the determinant,",00:04:14.200,00:04:16.750
"which is two minus
two which is zero.",00:04:16.750,00:04:19.910
"So there's my characteristic
polynomial, this determinant.",00:04:19.910,00:04:26.490
"And of course I factor that into
lambda times lambda plus three",00:04:26.490,00:04:31.960
"and I get the two eigenvalues
that we saw coming.",00:04:31.960,00:04:37.590
What else do I need?,00:04:37.590,00:04:38.830
The eigenvectors.,00:04:38.830,00:04:40.320
"So before I even think about the
differential equation or what",00:04:40.320,00:04:44.020
"-- how to solve it, let me
find the eigenvectors for this",00:04:44.020,00:04:47.780
matrix.,00:04:47.780,00:04:48.910
Okay.,00:04:48.910,00:04:49.430
So take lambda equals zero --,00:04:49.430,00:04:52.970
"so that -- that's
the first eigenvalue.",00:04:52.970,00:04:55.370
"Lambda one equals zero
and the second eigenvalue",00:04:55.370,00:04:58.690
"will be lambda two
equals minus three.",00:04:58.690,00:05:03.130
"By the way, I --",00:05:03.130,00:05:05.210
"I already know something
important about this.",00:05:05.210,00:05:09.010
"The eigenvalues are
telling me something.",00:05:09.010,00:05:11.920
"You'll see how it comes
out, but let me point to --",00:05:11.920,00:05:15.820
"these numbers are
-- this eigenvalue,",00:05:15.820,00:05:19.640
"a negative eigenvalue,
is going to disappear.",00:05:19.640,00:05:23.700
"There's going to be an e to the
minus three t in the answer.",00:05:23.700,00:05:28.620
"That e to the minus
three t as times goes on",00:05:28.620,00:05:31.690
"is going to be very, very small.",00:05:31.690,00:05:34.070
"The other part of the
answer will involve an e",00:05:34.070,00:05:38.360
to the zero t.,00:05:38.360,00:05:40.390
"But e to the zero t is
one and that's a constant.",00:05:40.390,00:05:44.330
"So I'm expecting that this
solution'll have two parts,",00:05:44.330,00:05:49.190
"an e to the zero t part and an
e to the minus three t part,",00:05:49.190,00:05:53.570
"and that -- and as time goes
on, the second part'll disappear",00:05:53.570,00:05:57.900
"and the first part
will be a steady",00:05:57.900,00:06:00.360
It won't move. state.,00:06:00.360,00:06:02.030
"It will be -- at the end of
-- as t approaches infinity,",00:06:02.030,00:06:06.740
"this part disappears
and this is the --",00:06:06.740,00:06:09.800
"the e to the zero t
part is what I get.",00:06:09.800,00:06:13.330
"And I'm very interested in these
steady states, so that's --",00:06:13.330,00:06:17.120
"I get a steady state
when I have a zero",00:06:17.120,00:06:19.330
eigenvalue.,00:06:19.330,00:06:20.150
Okay.,00:06:20.150,00:06:20.650
What about those eigenvectors?,00:06:20.650,00:06:22.950
"So what's the eigenvector that
goes with eigenvalue zero?",00:06:22.950,00:06:26.170
Okay.,00:06:26.170,00:06:26.670
"The matrix is singular as
it is, the eigenvector is --",00:06:26.670,00:06:31.280
"is the guy in the null space,
so what vector is in the null",00:06:31.280,00:06:34.940
space of that matrix?,00:06:34.940,00:06:37.890
Let's see.,00:06:37.890,00:06:38.860
"I guess I probably give the
free variable the value one",00:06:38.860,00:06:42.900
"and I realize that if I want to
get zero I need a two up here.",00:06:42.900,00:06:48.630
Okay?,00:06:48.630,00:06:49.260
So Ax1 is zero x1.,00:06:49.260,00:06:52.560
A x1 is zero x1.,00:06:52.560,00:06:55.550
Fine.,00:06:55.550,00:06:56.370
Okay.,00:06:56.370,00:06:57.520
What about the other eigenvalue?,00:06:57.520,00:06:59.520
Lambda two is minus three.,00:06:59.520,00:07:01.801
Okay.,00:07:01.801,00:07:02.300
"How do I get the other
eigenvalue, then?",00:07:02.300,00:07:05.010
"For the moment --
can I mentally do it?",00:07:05.010,00:07:08.080
"I subtract minus three
along the diagonal,",00:07:08.080,00:07:12.850
which means I add three --,00:07:12.850,00:07:15.070
"can I -- I'll just do it with an
erase -- erase for the moment.",00:07:15.070,00:07:18.370
"So I'm going to add
three to the diagonal.",00:07:18.370,00:07:20.950
"So this minus one will
become a two and --",00:07:20.950,00:07:26.040
"I'll make it in big
loopy letters --",00:07:26.040,00:07:28.450
"and when I add three to this
guy, the minus two becomes --",00:07:28.450,00:07:32.350
"well, I can't make one
very loopy, but how's that?",00:07:32.350,00:07:36.200
Okay.,00:07:36.200,00:07:37.410
Now that's A minus three I --,00:07:37.410,00:07:40.200
"A plus three I, sorry.",00:07:40.200,00:07:41.540
That's A plus three I.,00:07:41.540,00:07:43.400
"It's supposed to
be singular, right?",00:07:43.400,00:07:45.510
"I-- if things --
if I did it right,",00:07:45.510,00:07:48.260
"this matrix should be
singular and the x2,",00:07:48.260,00:07:51.930
"the eigenvector should
be in its null space.",00:07:51.930,00:07:55.521
Okay.,00:07:55.521,00:07:56.020
"What do I get for the
null space of this?",00:07:56.020,00:07:58.510
"Maybe minus one one,
or one minus one.",00:07:58.510,00:08:02.140
Doesn't matter.,00:08:02.140,00:08:03.240
Those are both perfectly good.,00:08:03.240,00:08:05.300
Right?,00:08:05.300,00:08:05.800
"Because that's in the
null space of this.",00:08:05.800,00:08:07.550
"Now I'll -- because A times
that vector is three times that",00:08:07.550,00:08:14.370
vector.,00:08:14.370,00:08:15.600
Ax2 is minus three x2.,00:08:15.600,00:08:20.370
Good.,00:08:20.370,00:08:22.540
Okay.,00:08:22.540,00:08:23.040
"Can I get A again so
we see that correctly?",00:08:23.040,00:08:26.380
"That was a minus one and
that was a minus two.",00:08:26.380,00:08:29.680
Good.,00:08:29.680,00:08:31.730
Okay.,00:08:31.730,00:08:32.809
That -- that's the first job.,00:08:32.809,00:08:35.470
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.,00:08:35.470,00:08:37.970
"And already the
eigenvalues are telling me",00:08:37.970,00:08:41.179
"the most important
information about the answer.",00:08:41.179,00:08:44.240
"But now, what is the answer?",00:08:44.240,00:08:46.540
"The answer is -- the
solution will be U of T --",00:08:46.540,00:08:54.420
okay.,00:08:54.420,00:08:54.920
"Now, wh- now I use those
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.",00:08:54.920,00:08:59.750
"The solution is some --
there are two eigenvalues.",00:08:59.750,00:09:04.210
"So I -- it -- so there're going
to be two special solutions",00:09:04.210,00:09:08.100
here.,00:09:08.100,00:09:08.910
Two pure exponential solutions.,00:09:08.910,00:09:12.040
"The first one is going to
be either the lambda one tx1",00:09:12.040,00:09:17.300
"and the -- so that solves the
equation, and so does this one.",00:09:17.300,00:09:23.440
"They both are solutions to
the differential equation.",00:09:23.440,00:09:29.290
That's the general solution.,00:09:29.290,00:09:31.640
"The general solution
is a combination",00:09:31.640,00:09:33.900
"of that pure
exponential solution",00:09:33.900,00:09:37.010
"and that pure
exponential solution.",00:09:37.010,00:09:39.630
"Can I just see that those
guys do solve the equation?",00:09:39.630,00:09:43.150
"So let me just check -- check
on this one, for example.",00:09:43.150,00:09:47.540
"I -- I want to check that
the -- my equation --",00:09:47.540,00:09:53.360
let's,00:09:53.360,00:09:53.860
"Check. remember, the
equation -- du/dt is Au.",00:09:53.860,00:09:57.190
"I plug in e to the
lambda one t x1",00:09:57.190,00:10:04.340
"and let's just see that
the equation's okay.",00:10:04.340,00:10:08.470
"I believe this is a
solution to that equation.",00:10:08.470,00:10:12.370
So just plug it in.,00:10:12.370,00:10:13.980
"On the left-hand side, I
take the time derivative --",00:10:13.980,00:10:17.870
"so the left-hand side will be
lambda one, e to the lambda one",00:10:17.870,00:10:22.700
"t x1, right?",00:10:22.700,00:10:25.540
"The time derivative -- this is
the term that depends on time,",00:10:25.540,00:10:28.990
"it's just ordinary exponential,
its derivative brings down",00:10:28.990,00:10:33.250
a lambda one.,00:10:33.250,00:10:34.470
"On the other side of the
equation it's A times this",00:10:34.470,00:10:37.460
thing.,00:10:37.460,00:10:38.380
"A times either the lambda one t
x one, and does that check out?",00:10:38.380,00:10:44.790
Do we have equality there?,00:10:44.790,00:10:47.550
"Yes, because either the lambda
one t appears on both sides",00:10:47.550,00:10:52.190
"and the other one is Ax1
equal lambda one x1 -- check.",00:10:52.190,00:10:58.030
"Do you -- so, the -- we've come
to the first point to remember.",00:10:58.030,00:11:02.590
These pure solutions.,00:11:02.590,00:11:05.030
"Those pure solutions are the
-- those pure exponentials are",00:11:05.030,00:11:10.760
"the differential
equations analogue of --",00:11:10.760,00:11:14.280
last time we had pure powers.,00:11:14.280,00:11:17.040
Last time -- so --,00:11:17.040,00:11:19.540
"so last time, the
analog was lambda --",00:11:19.540,00:11:24.200
"lambda one to the K-th power
x1, some amount of that,",00:11:24.200,00:11:29.020
"plus some amount of lambda
two to the K-th power x2.",00:11:29.020,00:11:35.130
"That was our formula

"I put it up just to -- so
your eye compares those two",00:11:37.590,00:11:41.690
formulas.,00:11:41.690,00:11:42.880
Powers of lambda in the --,00:11:42.880,00:11:45.550
"in the difference equation
-- that -- this was in the --",00:11:45.550,00:11:48.610
"this was for the equation
uk plus one equals A uk.",00:11:48.610,00:11:55.480
"That was for the finite
step -- stepping by one.",00:11:55.480,00:11:59.890
"And we got powers,
now this is the one",00:11:59.890,00:12:02.330
"we're interested in,
the exponentials.",00:12:02.330,00:12:04.920
"So -- so that's --
that's the solution --",00:12:04.920,00:12:08.750
what are c1 and c2?,00:12:08.750,00:12:10.660
Then we're through.,00:12:10.660,00:12:12.300
What are c1 and c2?,00:12:12.300,00:12:14.060
"Well, of course we know
these actual things.",00:12:14.060,00:12:17.340
"Let me just -- let
me come back to this.",00:12:17.340,00:12:22.260
"c1 is -- we haven't figured out
yet, but e to the lambda one t,",00:12:22.260,00:12:26.790
"the lambda one is zero so that's
just a one times x1 which is",00:12:26.790,00:12:32.890
two one.,00:12:32.890,00:12:34.260
"So it's c1 times this one that's
not moving times the vector,",00:12:34.260,00:12:39.590
"the eigenvector two
one and c2 times --",00:12:39.590,00:12:44.660
what's e to the lambda two t?,00:12:44.660,00:12:47.730
Lambda two is minus three.,00:12:47.730,00:12:51.830
"So this is the term
that has the minus",00:12:51.830,00:12:54.010
"three t and its eigenvector
is this one minus one.",00:12:54.010,00:12:58.360
"So this vector
solves the equation",00:13:01.520,00:13:06.640
and any multiple of it.,00:13:06.640,00:13:08.580
"This vector solves the equation
if it's got that factor",00:13:08.580,00:13:12.190
e to the minus three t.,00:13:12.190,00:13:14.620
"We've got the answer
except for c1 and c2.",00:13:14.620,00:13:17.980
"So -- so everything I've done
is immediate as soon as you know",00:13:17.980,00:13:22.970
"the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.",00:13:22.970,00:13:25.570
So how do we get c1 and c2?,00:13:25.570,00:13:27.640
"That has to come from
the initial condition.",00:13:27.640,00:13:30.930
"So now I -- now I use -- u
of zero is given as one zero.",00:13:30.930,00:13:38.740
"So this is the initial condition
that will find c1 and c2.",00:13:41.780,00:13:46.346
"So let me do that on
the board underneath.",00:13:46.346,00:13:48.095
"At t equals zero, then --",00:13:51.080,00:13:52.935
"I get c1 times this guy plus
c2 and now I'm at times zero.",00:13:56.500,00:14:05.280
"So that's a one and
this is a one minus one",00:14:05.280,00:14:08.320
"and that's supposed to agree
with u of zero one zero.",00:14:08.320,00:14:12.920
Okay.,00:14:19.550,00:14:20.850
That should be two equations.,00:14:20.850,00:14:23.090
"That should give me c1 and
c2 and then I'm through.",00:14:23.090,00:14:26.500
So what are c1 and c2?,00:14:26.500,00:14:28.540
Let's see.,00:14:28.540,00:14:30.430
"I guess we could
actually spot them by eye",00:14:30.430,00:14:33.000
"or we could solve two
equations in two unknowns.",00:14:33.000,00:14:36.800
Let's see.,00:14:36.800,00:14:38.090
"If these were both ones
-- so I'm just adding --",00:14:38.090,00:14:40.940
then I would get three zero.,00:14:40.940,00:14:43.630
"So what's the -- what's
the solution, then?",00:14:43.630,00:14:46.740
"If -- if c1 and c2 are both
ones, I get three zero,",00:14:49.970,00:14:53.910
"so I want, like,
one third of that,",00:14:53.910,00:14:55.990
because I want to get one zero.,00:14:55.990,00:14:57.750
"So I think it's c1 equals
a third, c2 equals a third.",00:14:57.750,00:15:02.220
So finally I have the answer.,00:15:05.460,00:15:08.030
"Let me keep it in the
-- in this board here.",00:15:08.030,00:15:11.000
"Finally the answer is one third
of this plus one third of this.",00:15:11.000,00:15:20.530
"Do you see what -- what's
actually happening with this",00:15:24.450,00:15:27.990
flow?,00:15:27.990,00:15:28.880
"This flow started out at --
the solution started out at one",00:15:28.880,00:15:32.630
zero.,00:15:32.630,00:15:34.140
Started at one zero.,00:15:34.140,00:15:36.790
"Then as time went on,
people moved, essentially.",00:15:36.790,00:15:41.290
"Some fraction of
this one moved here.",00:15:41.290,00:15:46.190
"And -- and in the limit, there's
-- there's the limit, as --",00:15:46.190,00:15:52.030
right?,00:15:52.030,00:15:52.530
"As t goes to infinity,
as t gets very large,",00:15:52.530,00:15:55.540
"this disappears and this
is the steady state.",00:15:55.540,00:15:59.110
So the steady state is --,00:15:59.110,00:16:02.550
so the steady state --,00:16:02.550,00:16:04.272
"u -- we could call it u at
infinity is one third of two",00:16:08.700,00:16:14.190
and one.,00:16:14.190,00:16:15.040
"It's -- it's two
thirds of one third.",00:16:15.040,00:16:17.110
So that's the -- we really --,00:16:19.970,00:16:22.790
"I mean, you're
getting, like, total,",00:16:22.790,00:16:25.280
"insight into the
behavior of the solution,",00:16:25.280,00:16:29.790
"what the differential
equation does.",00:16:29.790,00:16:32.050
"Of course, we don't -- wouldn't
always have a steady state.",00:16:32.050,00:16:37.480
"Sometimes we would
approach zero.",00:16:37.480,00:16:40.580
Sometimes we would blow up.,00:16:40.580,00:16:42.320
"Can we straighten
out those cases?",00:16:42.320,00:16:45.250
The eigenvalue should tell us.,00:16:45.250,00:16:47.510
So when do we get --,00:16:47.510,00:16:50.170
"so -- so let me ask first,
when do we get stability?",00:16:50.170,00:16:54.440
That's u of t going to zero.,00:16:57.220,00:17:00.250
"When would the solution
go to zero no matter",00:17:03.070,00:17:05.660
what the initial condition is?,00:17:05.660,00:17:09.230
"Negative eigenvalues, right.",00:17:09.230,00:17:11.140
Negative eigenvalues.,00:17:11.140,00:17:12.609
But now I have to --,00:17:12.609,00:17:13.630
"I have to ask you
for one more step.",00:17:13.630,00:17:16.950
"Suppose the eigenvalues
are complex numbers?",00:17:16.950,00:17:20.420
Because we know they could be.,00:17:20.420,00:17:22.680
"Then we want stability --
this -- this -- we want --",00:17:22.680,00:17:27.760
"we need all these e to the
lambda t-s all going to zero",00:17:27.760,00:17:35.260
"and somehow that asks us
to have lambda negative.",00:17:35.260,00:17:40.920
"But suppose lambda
is a complex number?",00:17:40.920,00:17:43.470
Then what's the test?,00:17:43.470,00:17:45.690
"What -- if lambda's a
complex number like, oh,",00:17:45.690,00:17:50.340
"suppose lambda is negative
plus an imaginary part?",00:17:50.340,00:17:54.730
"Say lambda is minus
three plus six i?",00:17:54.730,00:17:59.810
What -- what happens then?,00:17:59.810,00:18:01.120
"Can we just, like,
do a -- a case here?",00:18:01.120,00:18:03.530
"If -- if this lambda is
minus three plus six it,",00:18:03.530,00:18:11.550

"Does this -- does this imaginary
part play a -- play a --",00:18:14.170,00:18:18.450
play a role here or not?,00:18:18.450,00:18:20.840
Or how big is --,00:18:20.840,00:18:22.850
"what's the absolute value
of that -- of that quantity?",00:18:22.850,00:18:25.700
"It's just e to the
minus three t, right?",00:18:28.530,00:18:32.670
"Because this other part, this --
the -- the magnitude -- the --",00:18:32.670,00:18:36.880
"this -- e to the six it -- what
-- that has absolute value one.",00:18:36.880,00:18:41.795
Right?,00:18:44.680,00:18:45.180
"That's just this cosine of
six t plus i, sine of six t.",00:18:45.180,00:18:50.540
"And the absolute
value squared will",00:18:50.540,00:18:53.060
"be cos squared plus sine
squared will be one.",00:18:53.060,00:18:56.230
"This is -- this complex number
is running around the unit",00:18:56.230,00:18:59.680
circle.,00:18:59.680,00:19:00.660
"This com- this -- the -- it's
the real part that matters.",00:19:00.660,00:19:04.770
This is what I'm trying to do.,00:19:04.770,00:19:07.020
"Real part of lambda
has to be negative.",00:19:07.020,00:19:10.980
"If lambda's a complex
number, it's the real part,",00:19:10.980,00:19:14.880
"the minus three, that
either makes us go to zero",00:19:14.880,00:19:19.200

"oscillate between
the two components.",00:19:27.380,00:19:30.690
Okay.,00:19:30.690,00:19:31.360
So that's stability.,00:19:31.360,00:19:33.230
And what about --,00:19:33.230,00:19:36.040
what about a steady state?,00:19:36.040,00:19:37.305
"When would we have,
a steady state,",00:19:42.130,00:19:45.490
always in the same direction?,00:19:45.490,00:19:47.390
So let me --,00:19:47.390,00:19:48.160
I'll take this part away --,00:19:48.160,00:19:51.280
"when -- so that was, like,
checking that it's --",00:19:51.280,00:19:54.280
"that it's the real part
that we care about.",00:19:54.280,00:19:57.830
"Now, we have a
steady state when --",00:19:57.830,00:20:01.530
"when lambda one is zero and the
other eigenvalues have what?",00:20:01.530,00:20:12.500
"So I'm looking -- like,
that example was, like,",00:20:12.500,00:20:14.990
perfect for a steady state.,00:20:14.990,00:20:18.910
"We have a zero eigenvalue
and the other eigenvalues,",00:20:18.910,00:20:22.760
we want those to disappear.,00:20:22.760,00:20:25.070
"So the other eigenvalues
have real part negative.",00:20:25.070,00:20:28.975
"And we blow up, for sure --",00:20:31.880,00:20:35.700
"we blow up if any real
part of lambda is positive.",00:20:35.700,00:20:45.380
"So if I -- if I reverse the
sign of A -- of the matrix A --",00:20:49.090,00:20:54.240
"suppose instead of the matrix
I had, the A that I had,",00:20:54.240,00:20:57.420
I changed it --,00:20:57.420,00:20:58.390
I changed all its sines.,00:20:58.390,00:21:00.770

eigenvalues and eigenvectors?",00:21:00.770,00:21:04.950

"of A, tell me about minus A.",00:21:08.090,00:21:11.520
What happens to the eigenvalues?,00:21:11.520,00:21:14.780
"For minus A, they'll
all change sine.",00:21:14.780,00:21:18.410
So I'll have blow up.,00:21:18.410,00:21:20.660
"This -- instead of the
e to the minus three t,",00:21:20.660,00:21:23.020

"I would have an e to the plus
three t and I would have blow",00:21:30.810,00:21:34.020
up.,00:21:34.020,00:21:36.150
"Of course the zero eigenvalue
would stay at zero,",00:21:36.150,00:21:39.430
"but the other guy
is taking off in --",00:21:39.430,00:21:42.490
if I reversed all the sines.,00:21:42.490,00:21:45.091
Okay.,00:21:45.091,00:21:45.590
"So this is -- this is
the stability picture.",00:21:45.590,00:21:51.090
"And for a two by two
matrix, we can actually",00:21:51.090,00:21:56.680
"pin down even more
closely what that means.",00:21:56.680,00:22:01.220
Can I -- let -- can I do that?,00:22:01.220,00:22:02.710
Let me do that --,00:22:02.710,00:22:04.410
I want to --,00:22:04.410,00:22:05.810
"for a two by two matrix, I
can tell whether the real part",00:22:05.810,00:22:11.230

negative, I -- well, let me --",00:22:11.230,00:22:14.740
"let me tell you what I
have in mind for that.",00:22:14.740,00:22:18.480
So two by two stability --,00:22:18.480,00:22:21.040
"let me -- this is
just a little comment.",00:22:21.040,00:22:25.750
Two by two stability.,00:22:25.750,00:22:27.506
"So my matrix, now,
is just a b c d",00:22:31.240,00:22:35.930
"and I'm looking for the real
parts of both eigenvalues",00:22:35.930,00:22:41.770
to be negative.,00:22:41.770,00:22:42.910
Okay.,00:22:47.480,00:22:47.980
"What -- how can I tell

"What would that tell
me about the trace?",00:23:04.930,00:23:07.260

have -- are negative,",00:23:21.760,00:23:25.320

"-- then, when I take the -- when
I look at the matrix and find",00:23:28.660,00:23:33.140

do I know about that?",00:23:33.140,00:23:36.930
"It's negative, right.",00:23:36.930,00:23:38.360

the -- this equals --",00:23:38.360,00:23:40.940
"this equals lambda one plus
lambda two, so it's negative.",00:23:40.940,00:23:47.010
"The two eigenvalues, by
the way, will have --",00:23:47.010,00:23:49.590
"if they're complex -- will have
plus six i and minus six i.",00:23:49.590,00:23:54.990
"The complex parts will -- will
be conjugates of each other",00:23:54.990,00:23:59.860
"and disappear when we add and
the trace will be negative.",00:23:59.860,00:24:04.720
"Okay, the trace
has to be negative.",00:24:04.720,00:24:06.710
Is that enough --,00:24:06.710,00:24:09.030
"is a negative trace enough
to make the matrix stable?",00:24:09.030,00:24:14.670

trace but still it's not stable?,00:24:19.270,00:24:24.040
"So it -- it has a blow -- it
still has a blow-up factor",00:24:24.040,00:24:27.500
"and a -- and a --

"So what would be a -- so
just -- just to see --",00:24:30.900,00:24:33.820
maybe I just put that here.,00:24:33.820,00:24:35.920
"This -- now I'm looking for an
example where the trace could",00:24:35.920,00:24:40.790
be negative but still blow up.,00:24:40.790,00:24:48.080
"Of course -- yeah,
let's just take one.",00:24:48.080,00:24:52.830
"Oh, look, let me -- let me make
it minus two zero zero one.",00:24:52.830,00:24:57.990
Okay.,00:24:57.990,00:25:00.140
"There's a case where that
matrix has negative trace --",00:25:00.140,00:25:04.810
"I know its
eigenvalues of course.",00:25:04.810,00:25:06.390
"They're minus two and
one and it blows up.",00:25:06.390,00:25:09.750
"It's got -- it's got a
plus one eigenvalue here,",00:25:09.750,00:25:12.780
"so there would be an e to
the plus t in the solution",00:25:12.780,00:25:17.280
"and it'll blow up if it has
any second component at all.",00:25:17.280,00:25:21.170
I need another condition.,00:25:21.170,00:25:23.900
"And it's a condition
on the determinant.",00:25:23.900,00:25:25.615
And what's that condition?,00:25:28.240,00:25:29.560
"If I know that the
two eigenvalues --",00:25:29.560,00:25:32.730
"suppose I know they're
negative, both negative.",00:25:32.730,00:25:36.090
"What does that tell me
about the determinant?",00:25:36.090,00:25:39.790
Let me ask again.,00:25:39.790,00:25:41.260
"If I know both the
eigenvalues are negative,",00:25:41.260,00:25:44.990
"then I know the
trace is negative",00:25:44.990,00:25:47.760
"but the determinant is
positive, because it's",00:25:47.760,00:25:53.170
"the product of the
two eigenvalues.",00:25:53.170,00:25:56.450
"So this determinant is
lambda one times lambda two.",00:25:56.450,00:26:00.580
"This is -- this is lambda
one times lambda two",00:26:00.580,00:26:04.540
"and if they're both negative,
the product is positive.",00:26:04.540,00:26:08.060
"So positive determinant,
negative trace.",00:26:08.060,00:26:11.860
"I can easily track down the --
this condition also for the --",00:26:11.860,00:26:17.200
"if -- if there's an imaginary
part hanging around.",00:26:17.200,00:26:20.380
Okay.,00:26:20.380,00:26:20.880
"So that's a -- like a
small but quite useful,",00:26:20.880,00:26:25.550
"because two by two is
always important --",00:26:25.550,00:26:29.820
comment on stability.,00:26:29.820,00:26:33.100
Okay.,00:26:33.100,00:26:33.750
"So let's just look
at the picture again.",00:26:33.750,00:26:40.170
Okay.,00:26:40.170,00:26:41.290
"The main part of my
lecture, the one thing",00:26:41.290,00:26:43.980
"you want to be able to,
like, just do automatically",00:26:43.980,00:26:46.700
"is this step of
solving the system.",00:26:46.700,00:26:51.750
"Find the eigenvalues,
find the eigenvectors,",00:26:51.750,00:26:54.190
find the coefficients.,00:26:54.190,00:26:56.000
"And notice -- what's the matrix
-- in this linear system here,",00:26:56.000,00:27:01.090
"I can't help -- if I -- if I
have equations like that --",00:27:01.090,00:27:05.590
"that's my equations
column at a time --",00:27:05.590,00:27:08.900
"what's the matrix
form of that equation?",00:27:08.900,00:27:11.710
"So -- so this -- this
system of equations is --",00:27:11.710,00:27:18.580
"is some matrix multiplying
c1, c2 to give u of zero.",00:27:18.580,00:27:26.710
One zero.,00:27:26.710,00:27:29.370
What's the matrix?,00:27:29.370,00:27:30.510
"Well, it's obviously
two one, one minus one,",00:27:30.510,00:27:35.400
"but we have a name, or
at least a letter --",00:27:35.400,00:27:37.760
actually a name for that matrix.,00:27:37.760,00:27:40.090
"Wh- what matrix
are we s- are we --",00:27:40.090,00:27:42.670
"are we dealing with here in
this step of finding the c-s?",00:27:42.670,00:27:47.390
Its letter is S --,00:27:47.390,00:27:50.690
it's the eigenvector matrix.,00:27:50.690,00:27:52.340
Of course.,00:27:52.340,00:27:52.970
"These are the
eigenvectors, there",00:27:52.970,00:27:55.230
in the columns of our matrix.,00:27:55.230,00:27:57.150
"So this is S c
equals u of zero --",00:27:57.150,00:28:02.520
"is the -- that step where you
find the actual coefficients,",00:28:02.520,00:28:09.640
"you find out how much of
each pure exponential is",00:28:09.640,00:28:14.690
in the solution.,00:28:14.690,00:28:16.910
"By getting it right at the
start, then it stays right",00:28:16.910,00:28:20.660
forever.,00:28:20.660,00:28:21.320
"I -- you're seeing this

"each pure exponential goes on
its own way once you start it",00:28:24.820,00:28:29.090
from u of,00:28:29.090,00:28:29.620
zero.,00:28:29.620,00:28:30.490
"So you start it by
figuring out how much",00:28:30.490,00:28:33.810
"each one is present in u of
zero and then off they go.",00:28:33.810,00:28:37.880
Okay.,00:28:37.880,00:28:38.740
"So -- so that's a system of
two equations in two unknowns",00:28:38.740,00:28:45.110
coupled --,00:28:45.110,00:28:48.070
"the matrix sort of couples
u1 and u2 and the eigenvalues",00:28:48.070,00:28:53.630
"and eigenvectors uncouple
it, diagonalize it.",00:28:53.630,00:28:57.770
"Actually -- okay, now can I --",00:28:57.770,00:29:00.830
"can I think in terms
of S and lambda?",00:29:00.830,00:29:04.600
"So I want to write
the solution down,",00:29:04.600,00:29:07.330
again in terms of S and lambda.,00:29:07.330,00:29:10.840
Okay.,00:29:10.840,00:29:11.340
I'll do that on this far board.,00:29:11.340,00:29:14.890
Okay.,00:29:14.890,00:29:15.890
So I'm coming back to --,00:29:15.890,00:29:20.540
"I'm coming back to our
equation du/dt equals Au.",00:29:20.540,00:29:26.470
Now this matrix A couples them.,00:29:26.470,00:29:35.890
"The whole point of
eigenvectors is to uncouple.",00:29:35.890,00:29:39.010
"So one way to see that is
introduce set u equal A --",00:29:39.010,00:29:46.510
not,00:29:46.510,00:29:47.010
"A. It's S, the eigenvector
matrix that uncouples it.",00:29:47.010,00:29:54.580
"So I'm -- I'm taking this
equation as I'm given,",00:29:54.580,00:29:58.890
"coupled with -- with A has --
is probably full of non-zeroes,",00:29:58.890,00:30:04.150
"but I'm -- by uncoupling it,
I mean I'm diagonalizing it.",00:30:04.150,00:30:08.130
"If I can get a
diagonal matrix, I'm --",00:30:08.130,00:30:11.630
I'm in.,00:30:11.630,00:30:12.470
Okay.,00:30:12.470,00:30:13.120
So I plug that in.,00:30:13.120,00:30:14.950
This is A S v.,00:30:14.950,00:30:18.720
And this is S dv/dt.,00:30:18.720,00:30:20.813
S is a constant.,00:30:25.810,00:30:26.890
"It's -- this it the
eigenvector matrix.",00:30:26.890,00:30:30.050
This is the eigenvector matrix.,00:30:30.050,00:30:31.635
Okay.,00:30:34.820,00:30:35.330
"Now I'm going to bring
S inverse over here.",00:30:35.330,00:30:37.550
And what have I got?,00:30:40.390,00:30:41.285
"That combination S inverse A S
is lambda, the diagonal matrix.",00:30:45.160,00:30:53.470
"That's -- that's the
point, that in --",00:30:53.470,00:30:56.940
"if I'm using the
eigenvectors as my basis,",00:30:56.940,00:31:01.400
"then my system of
equations is just diagonal.",00:31:01.400,00:31:06.700
"I -- each -- there's
no coupling anymore --",00:31:06.700,00:31:10.420
dv1/dt is lambda one v1.,00:31:10.420,00:31:13.130
"So let's just write that
down. dv1/ dt is lambda one v1",00:31:13.130,00:31:20.890
"and so on for all
n of the equations.",00:31:20.890,00:31:26.470
"It's a system of equations
but they're not connected,",00:31:26.470,00:31:29.610
"so they're easy to solve
and why don't I just",00:31:29.610,00:31:32.865
write down the solution?,00:31:32.865,00:31:33.865
"v -- well, v is now some
e to the lambda one t --",00:31:36.880,00:31:47.160
"well, okay --",00:31:47.160,00:31:49.600
"I guess my idea here now is to
use, the natural notation --",00:31:49.600,00:31:56.330
"v of T is e to the
lambda tv of zero.",00:31:56.330,00:32:04.740
"And u of t will be Se to the
lambda t S inverse, u of zero.",00:32:04.740,00:32:16.150
"This is the -- this is the,
formula I'm headed for.",00:32:16.150,00:32:20.990
"This -- this matrix, S e
to the lambda t S inverse,",00:32:25.220,00:32:29.530
that's my exponential.,00:32:29.530,00:32:32.040
"That's my e to the A t, is this
S e to the lambda t S inverse.",00:32:32.040,00:32:40.483
"So my -- my job really now is
to explain what's going on with",00:32:43.600,00:32:47.310
"this matrix up in
the exponential.",00:32:47.310,00:32:49.620
What does that mean?,00:32:49.620,00:32:51.610
"What does it mean to
say e to a matrix?",00:32:51.610,00:32:54.110
"This ought to be easier because
this is e to a diagonal matrix,",00:32:58.100,00:33:01.680
but still it's a matrix.,00:33:01.680,00:33:03.970
What do we mean by e to the A t?,00:33:03.970,00:33:07.350
"Because really e to the
A t is my answer here.",00:33:07.350,00:33:13.120
"My -- my answer to
this equation is --",00:33:13.120,00:33:18.620
"this u of t, this is my -- this
is my e to the A t u of zero.",00:33:18.620,00:33:26.170
"So it's -- my job is
really now to say what's --",00:33:26.170,00:33:30.907
what does that mean?,00:33:30.907,00:33:31.740
"What's the exponential
of a matrix",00:33:31.740,00:33:33.780
and why is that formula correct?,00:33:33.780,00:33:38.390
Okay.,00:33:38.390,00:33:38.950
"So I'll put that on
the board underneath.",00:33:38.950,00:33:42.190
"What's the exponential
of a matrix?",00:33:42.190,00:33:45.210
Let me come back here.,00:33:45.210,00:33:47.430
"So I'm talking about
matrix exponentials.",00:33:47.430,00:33:49.460
e to the At.,00:33:55.040,00:33:57.540
Okay.,00:33:57.540,00:33:58.350
"How are we going to define
the exponential of a --",00:33:58.350,00:34:01.090
of something?,00:34:01.090,00:34:01.735
"The trick -- the idea is --
the thing to go back to is",00:34:04.490,00:34:09.940
"exponential -- there's a
power series for exponentials.",00:34:09.940,00:34:15.860
"That's how you -- you -- the
good way to define e to the x",00:34:15.860,00:34:19.690
"is the power series one plus
x plus one half x squared,",00:34:19.690,00:34:25.469
"one six x cubed and we'll
do it now when the --",00:34:25.469,00:34:29.489
when we have a matrix.,00:34:29.489,00:34:30.770
"So the one becomes the
identity, the x is At,",00:34:30.770,00:34:34.739
"the x squared is At squared
and I divide by two.",00:34:34.739,00:34:42.620
"The cube, the x cube
is At cubed over six,",00:34:42.620,00:34:47.600
"and what's the
general term in here?",00:34:47.600,00:34:50.880
"At to the n-th
power divided by --",00:34:50.880,00:34:55.929
and it goes on.,00:34:55.929,00:34:57.710
But what do I divide by?,00:34:57.710,00:35:01.430
"So, you see the pattern
-- here I divided by one,",00:35:01.430,00:35:05.350
"here I divided by one by two by
six, those are the factorials.",00:35:05.350,00:35:10.080
It's n factorial.,00:35:10.080,00:35:10.965
"That was, like, the one
beautiful Taylor series.",00:35:14.110,00:35:17.445
"The one beautiful Taylor series
-- well, there are two --",00:35:20.300,00:35:23.180
"there are two beautiful
Taylor series in this world.",00:35:23.180,00:35:25.960
"The Taylor series
for e to the x is",00:35:25.960,00:35:29.550
"the s with x to the

what function that one is?",00:35:47.920,00:35:51.300

this is the series,",00:35:51.300,00:35:53.990
"all these sums are going
from zero to infinity.",00:35:53.990,00:35:58.070
"What's -- what
function have I got --",00:35:58.070,00:35:59.960
this is like a side comment --,00:35:59.960,00:36:02.770

squared plus x cubed plus x",00:36:02.770,00:36:06.750
"to the fourth not divided

what's that function?,00:36:09.430,00:36:11.800
"One plus x plus x squared plus

"It's the geometric series, the
nicest power series of all.",00:36:18.700,00:36:24.120
"So, actually, of course, there
would be a similar thing here.",00:36:24.120,00:36:28.850
"If -- if I wanted, I minus
A t inverse would be --",00:36:28.850,00:36:36.810
now I've got matrixes.,00:36:36.810,00:36:39.060
"I've got matrixes everywhere,
but it's just like that series",00:36:39.060,00:36:43.150
"with -- and just like this
one without the divisions.",00:36:43.150,00:36:46.690
"It's I plus At plus At squared
plus At cubed and forever.",00:36:46.690,00:36:56.310
"So that's actually a --
a reasonable way to find",00:36:59.200,00:37:02.460
the inverse of a matrix.,00:37:02.460,00:37:04.660

if t is small.",00:37:07.500,00:37:10.120

"then t squared is
extremely small,",00:37:13.330,00:37:15.940
"t cubed is even smaller,
so approximately",00:37:15.940,00:37:19.350
that inverse is I plus At.,00:37:19.350,00:37:22.480
I can keep more terms if I like.,00:37:22.480,00:37:24.660
Do you see what I'm doing?,00:37:24.660,00:37:25.830
"I'm just saying we can do the
same thing for matrixes that we",00:37:25.830,00:37:31.440

better than this one.",00:37:38.470,00:37:41.990
Why?,00:37:41.990,00:37:43.290

sum, e to the At is a -- is --",00:37:57.430,00:38:01.960
is completely defined.,00:38:01.960,00:38:04.390
"Whereas this second
guy could fail, right?",00:38:04.390,00:38:08.710
If At is big --,00:38:08.710,00:38:11.730
"somehow if At has an
eigenvalue larger than one,",00:38:11.730,00:38:15.190
"then when I square it it'll
have that eigenvalue squared,",00:38:15.190,00:38:18.690
"when I cube it the
eigenvalue will be cubed --",00:38:18.690,00:38:21.820
"that series will blow up
unless the eigenvalues of At",00:38:21.820,00:38:26.560
are smaller than one.,00:38:26.560,00:38:28.500
"So when the eigenvalues of
At are smaller than one --",00:38:28.500,00:38:32.150
so I'd better put that in.,00:38:32.150,00:38:33.610
"The -- all eigenvalues
of At below one --",00:38:33.610,00:38:38.260
"then that series converges
and gives me the inverse.",00:38:38.260,00:38:42.230
Okay.,00:38:42.230,00:38:42.970
"So this is the guy I'm chiefly
interested in, and I wanted",00:38:42.970,00:38:47.590
to connect it to --,00:38:47.590,00:38:51.820
"oh, okay.",00:38:51.820,00:38:52.400
"What's -- how do I -- how do
I get -- this is my, like,",00:38:52.400,00:38:55.810
main thing now to do --,00:38:55.810,00:38:58.160
how do I get e to the At --,00:38:58.160,00:39:02.270
"how do I see that e to the
At is the same as this?",00:39:02.270,00:39:05.760
"In other words, I can find e to
the At by finding S and lambda,",00:39:10.450,00:39:16.410
because now e to the lambda t,00:39:16.410,00:39:18.710
is easy.,00:39:18.710,00:39:21.350
"Lambda's a diagonal matrix
and we can write down either",00:39:21.350,00:39:24.820
"the lambda t -- and will
right -- in a minute.",00:39:24.820,00:39:27.250
But how -- do you see what --,00:39:27.250,00:39:29.810
"do you see that
we're hoping for a --",00:39:29.810,00:39:33.290
"we're hoping that we can
compute either the A T from S",00:39:33.290,00:39:38.540
and lambda --,00:39:38.540,00:39:41.450
"and I have to look at that
definition and say, okay,",00:39:41.450,00:39:44.980
"how do -- how do I get an S and
the lambda to come out of that?",00:39:44.980,00:39:48.660
"Okay, can -- do you see how I --",00:39:48.660,00:39:50.670
"I want to connect that to
that, from that definition.",00:39:50.670,00:39:54.830
"So let me erase this --
the geometric series,",00:39:54.830,00:39:59.090
"which isn't part of the
differential equations case",00:39:59.090,00:40:08.250
"and get the S and the
lambda into this picture.",00:40:08.250,00:40:14.200
"Oh, okay.",00:40:14.200,00:40:15.900
Here we go.,00:40:15.900,00:40:16.420
So identity is fine.,00:40:19.210,00:40:22.930
"Now -- all right, you --
you -- you'll see how I'm --",00:40:22.930,00:40:26.880
"how I'm -- how I going to
get A replaced by S and S is",00:40:26.880,00:40:31.900
in lambda's?,00:40:31.900,00:40:32.550
"Well I use the fundamental
formula of this whole chapter.",00:40:32.550,00:40:36.520
"A is S lambda S inverse
and then times t.",00:40:36.520,00:40:43.540
That's At.,00:40:43.540,00:40:45.451
Okay.,00:40:45.451,00:40:45.950
What's A squared t?,00:40:45.950,00:40:48.910
"I can -- I've got
the divide by two,",00:40:48.910,00:40:51.450
"I've got the t squared
and I've got an A squared.",00:40:51.450,00:40:56.580
"All right, I -- so I've got
a -- there's A -- there's A.",00:40:56.580,00:41:02.580
Now square it.,00:41:02.580,00:41:04.390
"So what happens
when I square it?",00:41:04.390,00:41:05.880
We've seen that before.,00:41:05.880,00:41:08.050
"When I square it, I get S
lambda squared S inverse, right?",00:41:08.050,00:41:16.120
"When I square that thing,
the -- there's an S and a --",00:41:16.120,00:41:20.070
an S cancels out an S inverse.,00:41:20.070,00:41:23.840
"I'm left with the S
on the left, the S",00:41:23.840,00:41:25.900
"inverse on the right and
lambda squared in the middle.",00:41:25.900,00:41:29.140
And so on.,00:41:29.140,00:41:31.660
"The next one'll be S
lambda cubed, S inverse --",00:41:31.660,00:41:36.680
"times t cubed over
three factorial.",00:41:36.680,00:41:39.590
And now -- what do I do now?,00:41:39.590,00:41:45.190
"I want to pull an S
out from everything.",00:41:45.190,00:41:48.440
"I want an S out of
the whole thing.",00:41:48.440,00:41:53.010
"Well, look, I'd better
write the identity how?",00:41:53.010,00:41:57.020
"I -- I want to be able to pull
an S out and an S inverse out",00:41:57.020,00:42:01.250
"from the other side, so I just
write the identity as S times S",00:42:01.250,00:42:04.840
inverse.,00:42:04.840,00:42:05.820
"So I have an S there and
an S inverse from this side",00:42:05.820,00:42:11.120
"and what have I
got in the middle?",00:42:11.120,00:42:13.240
"If I pull out an S
and an S inverse,",00:42:16.170,00:42:18.241
what have I got in the middle?,00:42:18.241,00:42:19.490
"I've got the
identity, a lambda t,",00:42:19.490,00:42:23.260
"a lambda squared t
squared over two --",00:42:23.260,00:42:26.650
I've got e to the lambda t.,00:42:26.650,00:42:30.780
That's what's in the middle.,00:42:30.780,00:42:32.600
"That's my formula
for e to the At.",00:42:32.600,00:42:36.630
"Oh, now I have to ask you.",00:42:36.630,00:42:39.120
Does this formula always work?,00:42:39.120,00:42:42.290
This formula always works --,00:42:42.290,00:42:45.420
"well, except it's
an infinite series.",00:42:45.420,00:42:48.540
"But what do I mean
by always work?",00:42:48.540,00:42:51.800
"And this one doesn't
always work and I just",00:42:51.800,00:42:55.300
"have to remind you
of what assumption",00:42:55.300,00:42:58.460
"is built into this
formula that's",00:42:58.460,00:43:00.660
not built into the original.,00:43:00.660,00:43:03.580
"The assumption that A
can be diagonalized.",00:43:03.580,00:43:07.900
"You'll remember that
there are some small --",00:43:07.900,00:43:11.660
"sm- some subset of
matrixes that don't",00:43:11.660,00:43:14.770
"have n independent
eigenvectors, so we",00:43:14.770,00:43:18.000
"don't have an S inverse
for those matrixes",00:43:18.000,00:43:20.590
"and the whole
diagonalization breaks down.",00:43:20.590,00:43:24.780
"We could still
make it triangular.",00:43:24.780,00:43:26.860
I'll tell you about that.,00:43:26.860,00:43:28.010
"But diagonal we can't do for
those particular degenerate",00:43:28.010,00:43:32.930
"matrixes that don't have enough
independent eigenvectors.",00:43:32.930,00:43:37.310
"But otherwise, this is golden.",00:43:37.310,00:43:40.240
Okay.,00:43:40.240,00:43:40.970
"So that's the formula --
that's the matrix exponential.",00:43:40.970,00:43:44.780
"Now it just remains for me to
say what is e to the lambda t?",00:43:44.780,00:43:48.680
Can I just do that?,00:43:48.680,00:43:50.460
"Let me just put that
in the corner here.",00:43:50.460,00:43:55.280
"What is the exponential
of a diagonal matrix?",00:43:55.280,00:44:02.180
"Remember lambda is diagonal,
lambda one down to lambda n.",00:44:02.180,00:44:10.140
"What's the exponential
of that diagonal matrix?",00:44:10.140,00:44:14.520
"Because our whole point is
that this ought to be simple.",00:44:14.520,00:44:19.550
"Our whole point is that to take
the exponential of a diagonal",00:44:19.550,00:44:23.240
"matrix ought to be
completely decoupled --",00:44:23.240,00:44:27.560
"it ought to be diagonal,
in other words, and it is.",00:44:27.560,00:44:30.300
"It's just e to the lambda
one t, e to the lambda two t,",00:44:30.300,00:44:37.010
"e to the lambda n t, all zeroes.",00:44:37.010,00:44:41.070
"So -- so if we have a diagonal
matrix and I plug it into this",00:44:41.070,00:44:47.620
"exponential formula,
everything's diagonal",00:44:47.620,00:44:52.140
"and the diagonal terms are
just the ordinary scaler",00:44:52.140,00:44:55.710
"exponentials e to
the lambda one t.",00:44:55.710,00:44:58.930
"Okay, so that's -- that's --",00:44:58.930,00:45:01.840
"in a sense, I'm doing here, on
this board, with -- with, like,",00:45:01.840,00:45:06.050
formulas what I did on the --,00:45:06.050,00:45:11.100
"in the first half of the
lecture with specific matrix A",00:45:11.100,00:45:15.940
"and specific eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.",00:45:15.940,00:45:19.270
"The -- so let me show
you the formulas again.",00:45:19.270,00:45:21.990
But the -- so you --,00:45:21.990,00:45:24.770
"I guess -- what should
you know from this",00:45:24.770,00:45:27.300
lecture?,00:45:27.300,00:45:28.300
"You should know what this
matrix exponential is and, like,",00:45:28.300,00:45:34.180
when does it go to zero?,00:45:34.180,00:45:36.670
"Tell me again, now,
the answer to that.",00:45:36.670,00:45:38.390
"When does e to
the At approach --",00:45:38.390,00:45:41.350
"get smaller and
smaller as t increases?",00:45:41.350,00:45:45.510
"Well, the S and the S
inverse aren't moving.",00:45:45.510,00:45:49.070
"It's this one that has to
get smaller and smaller",00:45:49.070,00:45:51.780
"and that one has this
simple diagonal form.",00:45:51.780,00:45:57.160
"And it goes to zero provided
every one of these lambdas --",00:45:57.160,00:46:01.740
"I -- I need to have each one
of these guys go to zero,",00:46:01.740,00:46:04.840
"so I need every real part of
every eigenvalue negative.",00:46:04.840,00:46:09.930
Right?,00:46:12.650,00:46:13.230
"If the real part is
negative, that's --",00:46:13.230,00:46:15.690
"that takes the exponential
-- that forces --",00:46:15.690,00:46:19.160
the exponential goes to zero.,00:46:19.160,00:46:21.420
"Okay, so that -- that's
really the difference.",00:46:21.420,00:46:24.480
"If I can just draw the -- here's
a picture of the -- of the --",00:46:24.480,00:46:33.250
this is the complex plain.,00:46:33.250,00:46:36.780
"Here's the real axis and
here's the imaginary axis.",00:46:36.780,00:46:42.080
"And where do the
eigenvalues have",00:46:42.080,00:46:43.960
"to be for stability in
differential equations?",00:46:43.960,00:46:47.570
"They have to be over here,
in the left half plain.",00:46:47.570,00:46:52.470
"So the left half plain is this
plain, real part of lambda,",00:46:52.470,00:46:55.910
less than zero.,00:46:55.910,00:46:58.820
"Where do the ma- where
do the eigenvalues have",00:46:58.820,00:47:01.190
"to be for powers of the
matrix to go to zero?",00:47:01.190,00:47:06.500
"Powers of the matrix go to zero
if the eigenvalues are in here.",00:47:06.500,00:47:11.960
"So this is the stability
region for powers --",00:47:11.960,00:47:17.800
"this is the region -- absolute
value of lambda, less than one.",00:47:17.800,00:47:22.490
"That's the stability for -- that
tells us that the powers of A",00:47:22.490,00:47:26.740
"go to zero, this tells us
that the exponential of A goes",00:47:26.740,00:47:30.260
to zero.,00:47:30.260,00:47:31.220
Okay.,00:47:31.220,00:47:31.790
One final example.,00:47:31.790,00:47:33.700
"Let me just write down how
to deal with a final example.",00:47:33.700,00:47:38.580
Let's see.,00:47:38.580,00:47:39.980
"So my final example will be a
single equation, u''+bu'+Ku=0.",00:47:44.480,00:47:48.930
"One equation, second order.",00:47:57.040,00:48:01.000
How do I --,00:48:01.000,00:48:03.490
and maybe I should have used --,00:48:03.490,00:48:05.290
"I'll use -- I prefer
to use y here,",00:48:05.290,00:48:08.170
"because that's what you see
in differential equations.",00:48:08.170,00:48:12.170
And I want u to be a vector.,00:48:12.170,00:48:14.790
"So how do I change one second
order equation into a two",00:48:14.790,00:48:23.730
by two first order system?,00:48:23.730,00:48:28.250
"Just the way I
did for Fibonacci.",00:48:28.250,00:48:30.540
I'll let u be y prime and y.,00:48:30.540,00:48:38.180
"What I'm going to do is I'm
going to add an extra equation,",00:48:38.180,00:48:43.210
y prime equals y prime.,00:48:43.210,00:48:46.620
So I take this -- so by --,00:48:46.620,00:48:50.800
"so using this as
the vector unknown,",00:48:50.800,00:48:55.110
now my equation is u prime.,00:48:55.110,00:48:58.830
"My first order
system is u prime,",00:48:58.830,00:49:00.800
"that'll be y double prime y
prime, the derivative of u,",00:49:00.800,00:49:06.160
"okay, now the differential
equation is telling me that y",00:49:06.160,00:49:10.940
"double prime is m- so
I'm just looking for --",00:49:10.940,00:49:14.430
what's this matrix?,00:49:14.430,00:49:17.160
y prime y.,00:49:17.160,00:49:19.410

"to be the trivial equation
