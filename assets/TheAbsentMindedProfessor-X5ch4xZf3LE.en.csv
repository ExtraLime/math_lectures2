Hi.,00:00:00.430,00:00:00.860
"In this problem, we have an
absent-minded professor who",00:00:00.860,00:00:03.820
"will inadvertently give us some
practice with exponential",00:00:03.820,00:00:06.860
random variables.,00:00:06.860,00:00:08.460
"So the professor has made two
appointments with two students",00:00:08.460,00:00:13.630
"and inadvertently made them
at the same time.",00:00:13.630,00:00:17.480
"And what we do is we model the
duration of these appointments",00:00:17.480,00:00:21.390
"with an exponential
random variable.",00:00:21.390,00:00:23.340
"So remember, an exponential
random variable is a",00:00:23.340,00:00:26.760
"continuous random variable that
takes on non-negative",00:00:26.760,00:00:29.850
"values, and it's parametrized
by a rate parameter, lambda.",00:00:29.850,00:00:35.980
"And the exponential random
variable is often used to",00:00:35.980,00:00:39.030
"model durations of time-- so
time until something happens,",00:00:39.030,00:00:42.670
"so for example, in this case,
time until the student leaves",00:00:42.670,00:00:46.310
or the appointment is over.,00:00:46.310,00:00:47.420
"Or sometimes you will also use
it to be as a model of time",00:00:47.420,00:00:51.180
until something fails.,00:00:51.180,00:00:52.430
 ,00:00:52.430,00:00:54.600
"And one thing that will be
useful is the CDF of this",00:00:54.600,00:00:59.010
exponential random variable.,00:00:59.010,00:01:00.240
"So the probability that it's
less than or equal to some",00:01:00.240,00:01:02.280
"value, little t, is equal to 1
minus e to the minus lambda t.",00:01:02.280,00:01:07.290
"So this is, of course, valid
only when t is non-negative.",00:01:07.290,00:01:10.970
"The other useful property is
that the expected value of an",00:01:10.970,00:01:15.750
"exponential random variable
is just 1 over",00:01:15.750,00:01:17.790
the parameter lambda.,00:01:17.790,00:01:20.280
"And the last thing that we'll
use specifically in this",00:01:20.280,00:01:22.390
"problem is the memory
list property of",00:01:22.390,00:01:24.450
exponential random variables.,00:01:24.450,00:01:25.410
"And so recall that that just
means that if you pop in the",00:01:25.410,00:01:30.490
"middle of an exponential
random variable, the",00:01:30.490,00:01:36.700
"distribution for that random
variable going forward from",00:01:36.700,00:01:40.350
"the point where you popped in
is exactly the same as if it",00:01:40.350,00:01:43.345
had just started over.,00:01:43.345,00:01:44.400
"So that's why we call it the
memory list property.",00:01:44.400,00:01:46.430
"Basically, the past doesn't
really matter, and going",00:01:46.430,00:01:49.250
"forward from whatever point
that you observe it at, it",00:01:49.250,00:01:52.670
"looks as if it had just
started over afresh.",00:01:52.670,00:01:58.310
"And last thing we'll use, which
is a review of a concept",00:01:58.310,00:02:02.350
"from earlier, is total
expectation.",00:02:02.350,00:02:06.780
"So let's actually model
this problem",00:02:06.780,00:02:08.889
with two random variables.,00:02:08.889,00:02:10.979
"Let's let T1 be the time that
the first student takes in the",00:02:10.979,00:02:17.080
"appointment and T2 be the time
that the second student takes.",00:02:17.080,00:02:20.760
"And what we're told in the
problem is that they're both",00:02:20.760,00:02:23.160
"exponential with mean
30 minutes.",00:02:23.160,00:02:26.000
"So remember the mean being 30
minutes means that the lambda",00:02:26.000,00:02:29.240
is 1 over the mean.,00:02:29.240,00:02:30.640
"And so the lambda in this
case would be 1/30.",00:02:30.640,00:02:34.260
"And importantly, we're also
told that they are",00:02:34.260,00:02:35.770
independent.,00:02:35.770,00:02:36.710
"So how long the first person
takes is independent of how",00:02:36.710,00:02:40.160
long the second person takes.,00:02:40.160,00:02:41.960
"So the first student arrives on
time and take some random",00:02:41.960,00:02:46.560
"amount of time, T1.",00:02:46.560,00:02:48.110
"The second student arrives
exactly five minutes late.",00:02:48.110,00:02:51.330
"And whatever the second person
meets with the professor, that",00:02:51.330,00:02:55.170
"student will then take some
random amount of time, T2.",00:02:55.170,00:02:58.310
"What we're asked to do is find
the expected time between when",00:02:58.310,00:03:01.810
the first student arrives--,00:03:01.810,00:03:03.270
"so we can just call
that time 0--",00:03:03.270,00:03:05.370
"and when the second
student leaves.",00:03:05.370,00:03:08.920
"Now you may say, well we're
dealing with expectations, so",00:03:08.920,00:03:12.580
it's easier.,00:03:12.580,00:03:13.890
"And in this case, it probably is
just the expectation of how",00:03:13.890,00:03:19.640
"long the first student takes
plus the expectation of how",00:03:19.640,00:03:21.540
long the second student takes.,00:03:21.540,00:03:22.540
"So it should be about 60 minutes
or exactly 60 minutes.",00:03:22.540,00:03:26.450
"Now, why is that not
exactly right?",00:03:26.450,00:03:28.940
"It's because there is a small
wrinkle, that the students may",00:03:28.940,00:03:36.450
not go exactly back to back.,00:03:36.450,00:03:38.660
"So let's actually draw out a
time frame of what might",00:03:38.660,00:03:41.970
actually happen.,00:03:41.970,00:03:44.640
"So here's time 0, when the
first student arrives.",00:03:44.640,00:03:47.240
"And the first will go for some
amount of time and leave.",00:03:47.240,00:03:52.270
"And now let's consider
two scenarios.",00:03:52.270,00:03:54.390
"One scenario is that the first
student takes more than five",00:03:54.390,00:04:00.570
minutes to complete.,00:04:00.570,00:04:01.560
"Well then the second student
will have arrived at 5 minutes",00:04:01.560,00:04:10.120
"and then will be already waiting
whenever this first",00:04:10.120,00:04:14.210
student leaves.,00:04:14.210,00:04:14.810
So then the second student will,00:04:14.810,00:04:16.180
immediately pick up and continue.,00:04:16.180,00:04:18.310
"And in that case, we do have two
exponentials back to back.",00:04:18.310,00:04:22.740
"But there could be another
situation.",00:04:22.740,00:04:25.370
"Suppose that the first student
didn't take very long at all",00:04:25.370,00:04:32.110
"and finished within five
minutes, in which case the",00:04:32.110,00:04:37.260
"second student hasn't
arrived yet.",00:04:37.260,00:04:38.490
"So this professor is idle
in between here.",00:04:38.490,00:04:42.530
"And so we actually don't
necessarily have two of them",00:04:42.530,00:04:45.970
going back to back.,00:04:45.970,00:04:47.190
"So there's an empty period in
between that we have to",00:04:47.190,00:04:50.260
account for.,00:04:50.260,00:04:52.270
"So with that in mind, we see
that we have two scenarios.",00:04:52.270,00:04:57.730
"And so what does that
beg to use?",00:04:57.730,00:04:59.640
"Well, we can split them up into
the two scenarios and",00:04:59.640,00:05:02.520
"then calculate expectations
with each one and then use",00:05:02.520,00:05:05.140
"total expectation to
find the overall",00:05:05.140,00:05:09.280
expected length of time.,00:05:09.280,00:05:12.090
"OK, so let's begin with
the first scenario.",00:05:12.090,00:05:15.350
 ,00:05:15.350,00:05:19.690
"The first scenario is that,
let's say, the first student",00:05:19.690,00:05:24.450
finished within five minutes.,00:05:24.450,00:05:27.710
"So what does that mean in terms
of the definitions that",00:05:27.710,00:05:30.840
we've used?,00:05:30.840,00:05:31.870
"That means T1 is less
than or equal to 5.",00:05:31.870,00:05:37.050
"So if the first student took
less than five minutes, then",00:05:37.050,00:05:40.460
what happens?,00:05:40.460,00:05:41.840
"Then we know that the
amount of time that",00:05:41.840,00:05:46.070
you'd need to take--,00:05:46.070,00:05:47.320
 ,00:05:47.320,00:05:51.510
"let's call that something
else.",00:05:51.510,00:05:52.600
"Let's call that X. So X is the
random variable that we're",00:05:52.600,00:05:58.190
"interested in, the time between
when the first student",00:05:58.190,00:06:01.580
"comes and the second
student leaves.",00:06:01.580,00:06:04.140
"This is the value that
we want to find.",00:06:04.140,00:06:05.950
"Well we know that we're
guaranteed that there will be",00:06:05.950,00:06:10.440
a five-minute interval.,00:06:10.440,00:06:12.720
"So first student will come,
and then the second person",00:06:12.720,00:06:17.260
will take over.,00:06:17.260,00:06:19.070
"So we're guaranteed that the
first five minutes will be the",00:06:19.070,00:06:31.340
"difference between when time
starts and when the second",00:06:31.340,00:06:34.380
student arrives.,00:06:34.380,00:06:35.240
"And then, after that, it's just
however long the second",00:06:35.240,00:06:39.670
"student takes, which is just
the expected value of T2.",00:06:39.670,00:06:44.320
"And T2 is a exponential random
variable with mean 30.",00:06:44.320,00:06:47.770
"So in this case, it's just 35.",00:06:47.770,00:06:51.325
 ,00:06:51.325,00:06:55.800
"So the first student doesn't
take very long.",00:06:55.800,00:06:58.410
"Then we just get the five
minutes, that little buffer,",00:06:58.410,00:07:02.320
"plus however long the second
student takes, which, on",00:07:02.320,00:07:04.170
"average, is 30 minutes.",00:07:04.170,00:07:06.640
"Now what is the probability
of this happening?",00:07:06.640,00:07:09.260
"The probability of this
happening is the probability",00:07:09.260,00:07:12.820
"that the first student takes
less than five minutes.",00:07:12.820,00:07:16.080
"And here is where we use the CDF
that we wrote out earlier.",00:07:16.080,00:07:21.980
"It's going to be 1 minus e
to the minus lambda t.",00:07:21.980,00:07:30.650
"So in this case, t is five
and lambda is 1/30.",00:07:30.650,00:07:35.550
"So it's minus 5/30 is
the probability.",00:07:35.550,00:07:40.440
"All right, now let's consider
the second case.",00:07:40.440,00:07:43.580
"The second case is that the
first student actually takes",00:07:43.580,00:07:47.690
longer than five minutes.,00:07:47.690,00:07:50.360
"OK, so what happens
in that case?",00:07:50.360,00:07:54.350
Here's five minutes.,00:07:54.350,00:07:54.880
"The first student came
to five minutes.",00:07:54.880,00:07:58.300
"The second student arrived,
and the first",00:07:58.300,00:08:00.665
student is still going.,00:08:00.665,00:08:02.640
"So he goes for some
amount of time.",00:08:02.640,00:08:06.320
"And then whenever he finishes,
the second student continues.",00:08:06.320,00:08:10.310
"So now the question is, what
is the total amount of",00:08:10.310,00:08:13.120
time in this case?,00:08:13.120,00:08:14.960
"Well, you can think
of it as using",00:08:14.960,00:08:21.220
the memory list property.,00:08:21.220,00:08:22.150
This is where it comes in.,00:08:22.150,00:08:24.020
"So the first five minutes, we
know that it was already taken",00:08:24.020,00:08:27.550
"because we're considering the
second scenario, which we're",00:08:27.550,00:08:31.390
"given that T1 is
greater than 5.",00:08:31.390,00:08:34.860
"And so the question now is, if
we know that, how much longer",00:08:34.860,00:08:38.190
does it take?,00:08:38.190,00:08:39.650
"How much longer past the
five-minute mark does the",00:08:39.650,00:08:41.799
first student take?,00:08:41.799,00:08:43.049
"And by the member list property,
we know that it's as",00:08:43.049,00:08:46.570
"if the first student
started over.",00:08:46.570,00:08:49.210
"So there was no memory of the
first five minutes, and it's",00:08:49.210,00:08:51.800
"as if the first student just
arrived also at the",00:08:51.800,00:08:55.310
"five-minute mark and met
with the professor.",00:08:55.310,00:08:57.000
"So past the five-minute mark,
it's as if you have a new",00:08:57.000,00:09:02.950
"exponential random variable,
still with mean 30.",00:09:02.950,00:09:06.300
"And so what we get is that,
in this case, you get the",00:09:06.300,00:09:12.490
"guaranteed five minutes, and
then you get the memory list",00:09:12.490,00:09:18.760
"continuation of the first
student's appointment.",00:09:18.760,00:09:25.860
"So you get another 30 minutes
on average because of the",00:09:25.860,00:09:28.460
memory list property.,00:09:28.460,00:09:29.640
"And then whenever the first
student finally does finish",00:09:29.640,00:09:32.470
"up, the second student will
immediately take over because",00:09:32.470,00:09:35.950
he has already arrived.,00:09:35.950,00:09:37.080
"It's past the five-minute
mark.",00:09:37.080,00:09:38.580
"And then that second student
will take, again, on average,",00:09:38.580,00:09:41.520
30 more minutes.,00:09:41.520,00:09:42.530
"So what you get is, in this
case, the appointment lasts 65",00:09:42.530,00:09:47.130
minutes on average.,00:09:47.130,00:09:49.540
"Now what is the probability
of this case?",00:09:49.540,00:09:51.100
"The probability of this case is
the probability that T1 is",00:09:51.100,00:09:55.410
greater than 5.,00:09:55.410,00:09:57.150
"And now we know that that is
just the complement of this, 1",00:09:57.150,00:10:00.720
minus that.,00:10:00.720,00:10:01.520
"So it's just e to
the minus 5/30.",00:10:01.520,00:10:04.050
 ,00:10:04.050,00:10:06.840
So now we have both scenarios.,00:10:06.840,00:10:10.490
"We have the probabilities of
each scenario, and we have the",00:10:10.490,00:10:12.850
"expectation under
each scenario.",00:10:12.850,00:10:15.980
"Now all that remains now is to
combine them using total",00:10:15.980,00:10:18.810
expectation.,00:10:18.810,00:10:20.060
 ,00:10:20.060,00:10:26.990
"So I really should have written
expectation of X given",00:10:26.990,00:10:36.880
"T1 is less than or
equal to 5 here.",00:10:36.880,00:10:38.920
"And this is expectation
of X given that T1 is",00:10:38.920,00:10:42.630
greater than 5.,00:10:42.630,00:10:44.840
"So expectation of X overall is
the probability that T1 is",00:10:44.840,00:10:49.840
"less than or equal to 5 times
the expectation of X given",00:10:49.840,00:10:54.250
"that T1 is less than or equal to
5 plus the probability that",00:10:54.250,00:10:59.190
"T1 is greater than 5 times the
expectation of X given that T1",00:10:59.190,00:11:04.790
is greater than 5.,00:11:04.790,00:11:07.640
"And we have all four of
these pieces here.",00:11:07.640,00:11:10.440
"so it's 35 times 1 minus e to
the minus 5/30 plus 65 times e",00:11:10.440,00:11:23.220
to the minus 5 5/30.,00:11:23.220,00:11:26.650
"And it turns out that this
is approximately",00:11:26.650,00:11:31.600
equal to 60.394 minutes.,00:11:31.600,00:11:39.790
"All right, so what
have we found?",00:11:39.790,00:11:42.610
"We found that the original guess
that we had, if we just",00:11:42.610,00:11:47.430
"had two meetings back to back,
was on average it would take",00:11:47.430,00:11:50.360
60 minutes.,00:11:50.360,00:11:51.310
"It turns out that, because of
the way that things are set",00:11:51.310,00:11:55.150
"up, because of the five minute
thing, it actually takes a",00:11:55.150,00:11:58.890
"little longer than 60
minutes on average.",00:11:58.890,00:12:00.780
And why is that?,00:12:00.780,00:12:01.700
"It's because the five sometimes
adds an extra",00:12:01.700,00:12:08.630
"buffer, adds a little bit of
extra amount, because it would",00:12:08.630,00:12:13.930
"have been shorter in this
scenario because, if the both",00:12:13.930,00:12:18.820
"students had arrived on time,
then the second student would",00:12:18.820,00:12:21.030
"have been able to pick up
right here immediately.",00:12:21.030,00:12:23.570
"And so both appointments would
have ended sooner.",00:12:23.570,00:12:26.180
"But because the second student
didn't arrive until five",00:12:26.180,00:12:29.880
"minutes, there was some empty
space that was wasted.",00:12:29.880,00:12:32.490
"And that's where you get you the
little bit of extra time.",00:12:32.490,00:12:36.140
"So this is a nice problem just
to get some more exercise with",00:12:36.140,00:12:39.760
"exponential random variables
and also nicely illustrates",00:12:39.760,00:12:42.590
"the memory list property, which
was a key points in",00:12:42.590,00:12:46.560
order to solve this.,00:12:46.560,00:12:47.680
"And it also is nice because we
get to review a useful tool",00:12:47.680,00:12:52.170
"that we've been using all course
long, which is to split",00:12:52.170,00:12:56.350
"things into different scenarios
and then solve the",00:12:56.350,00:13:00.010
"simpler problems and then
combine them up, for example",00:13:00.010,00:13:02.770
using total expectation.,00:13:02.770,00:13:05.490
"So I hope that was helpful,
and see you next time.",00:13:05.490,00:13:08.120
