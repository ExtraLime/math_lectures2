"PROFESSOR: Today we're going
to keep on going",00:00:21.780,00:00:25.020
with related rates.,00:00:25.020,00:00:30.660
"And you may recall that last
time we were in the middle of",00:00:30.660,00:00:35.600
a problem with this geometry.,00:00:35.600,00:00:39.000
There was a right triangle.,00:00:39.000,00:00:41.260
There was a road.,00:00:41.260,00:00:43.190
"Which was going this way,
from right to left.",00:00:43.190,00:00:47.000
"And the police were up here,
monitoring the situation.",00:00:47.000,00:00:53.830
30 feet from the road.,00:00:53.830,00:00:55.990
And you're here.,00:00:55.990,00:00:59.990
And you're heading this way.,00:00:59.990,00:01:04.370
"Maybe it's a two lane highway,
but anyway it's only going",00:01:04.370,00:01:06.525
this direction.,00:01:06.525,00:01:07.680
And this distance was 50 feet.,00:01:07.680,00:01:11.670
"So, because you're moving, this
distance is varying and",00:01:11.670,00:01:17.320
so we gave it a letter.,00:01:17.320,00:01:19.120
"And, similarly, your distance
to the foot of the",00:01:19.120,00:01:21.900
"perpendicular with the
road is also varying.",00:01:21.900,00:01:25.050
"At this instant it's 40, because
this is a 3, 4, 5",00:01:25.050,00:01:29.890
right triangle.,00:01:29.890,00:01:31.570
"So this was the situation that
we were in last time.",00:01:31.570,00:01:35.830
"And we're going to pick
up where we left off.",00:01:35.830,00:01:38.090
"The question is, are you
speeding if the rate of change",00:01:38.090,00:01:50.860
"of D with respect to t is
80 feet per second.",00:01:50.860,00:01:56.510
"Now, technically that would be
- 80, because you're going",00:01:56.510,00:02:00.680
towards the policemen.,00:02:00.680,00:02:03.030
"Alright, so D is shrinking
at a rate of",00:02:03.030,00:02:05.530
- 80 feet per second.,00:02:05.530,00:02:10.550
"And I remind you that 95 feet
per second is approximately",00:02:10.550,00:02:16.910
the speed limit.,00:02:16.910,00:02:17.660
Which is 65 miles per hour.,00:02:17.660,00:02:21.370
"So, again, this is where
we were last time.",00:02:21.370,00:02:24.850
"And, got a little question
mark there.",00:02:24.850,00:02:30.150
"And so let's solve
this problem.",00:02:30.150,00:02:34.140
"So, this is the setup.",00:02:34.140,00:02:37.480
There's a right triangle.,00:02:37.480,00:02:38.880
"So there's a relationship
between these lengths.",00:02:38.880,00:02:42.290
"And the relationship is that
x ^2 + 30 ^2 = D ^2.",00:02:42.290,00:02:49.800
"So that's the first relationship
that we have. And",00:02:49.800,00:02:54.020
"the second relationship
that we have, we've",00:02:54.020,00:02:55.700
already written down.,00:02:55.700,00:02:57.380
"Which is dx / dt - oops, sorry.
dD / dt = minus 80.",00:02:57.380,00:03:08.620
"Now, the idea here is relatively
straightforward.",00:03:08.620,00:03:14.920
"We just want to use
differentiation.",00:03:14.920,00:03:17.790
"Now, you could solve for x.",00:03:17.790,00:03:25.810
"Alright, x is the square root
of D^2 - 30 squared.",00:03:25.810,00:03:31.580
That's one possibility.,00:03:31.580,00:03:32.820
"But this is basically
a waste of time.",00:03:32.820,00:03:36.060
It's a waste of your time.,00:03:36.060,00:03:37.810
"So it's easier, or easiest, to
follow this method of implicit",00:03:37.810,00:03:45.550
"differentiation, which
I want to encourage",00:03:45.550,00:03:47.380
you to get used to.,00:03:47.380,00:03:49.080
"Namely, we just differentiate
this equation",00:03:49.080,00:03:51.490
with respect to time.,00:03:51.490,00:03:53.460
"Now, when you do that, you have
to remember that you are",00:03:53.460,00:03:56.050
"not allowed to plug
in a constant.",00:03:56.050,00:03:59.120
"Namely 40, for t.",00:03:59.120,00:04:01.110
"You have to keep in mind what's
really going on in this",00:04:01.110,00:04:03.070
"problem which is that x is
moving, it's changing.",00:04:03.070,00:04:05.670
And D is also changing.,00:04:05.670,00:04:07.250
"So you have to differentiate
first before",00:04:07.250,00:04:10.380
you plug in the values.,00:04:10.380,00:04:12.030
"So the easiest thing is to use,
in this case, implicit",00:04:12.030,00:04:15.610
differentiation.,00:04:15.610,00:04:20.130
"And if I do that, I get 2x dx /
dt is equal to 2D (dD / dt).",00:04:20.130,00:04:33.000
No more DDT left.,00:04:33.000,00:04:34.910
We hope.,00:04:34.910,00:04:36.640
Except in this blackboard.,00:04:36.640,00:04:39.160
So there's our situation.,00:04:39.160,00:04:40.690
"Now, if I just plug in,
now I can plug in.",00:04:40.690,00:04:48.070
"In values. so this is after
taking the derivative.",00:04:48.070,00:04:52.820
"And, indeed, we have here 2
times the value for x which is",00:04:52.820,00:04:55.750
40 at this instant.,00:04:55.750,00:04:57.500
And then we have dx / dt.,00:04:57.500,00:05:01.070
"And that's equal to 2
(D), which is 50.",00:05:01.070,00:05:07.510
And then dD / dt is - 80.,00:05:07.510,00:05:12.900
"So the 80's cancel and we
see that dv / dt = -",00:05:12.900,00:05:19.180
100 feet per second.,00:05:19.180,00:05:21.660
"And so the answer to the
question is yes.",00:05:21.660,00:05:27.340
"Although you probably wouldn't
be pulled over for this much",00:05:27.340,00:05:30.770
of a violation.,00:05:30.770,00:05:32.540
"So that's, right, it's more than
65 miles an hour, by a",00:05:32.540,00:05:36.470
little bit.,00:05:36.470,00:05:41.190
"So that's the end of
this question.",00:05:41.190,00:05:43.380
"And usually in these rate of
change or related rates",00:05:43.380,00:05:46.460
"questions, this is considered
to be the answer to the",00:05:46.460,00:05:48.530
"question, if you like.",00:05:48.530,00:05:53.530
So that's one example.,00:05:53.530,00:05:55.600
"I'm going to give one more
example before we go on to",00:05:55.600,00:05:58.960
"some other applications implicit
differentiation.",00:05:58.960,00:06:04.560
"So my second example is going
to be, you have a it is a",00:06:04.560,00:06:11.520
conical tank.,00:06:11.520,00:06:17.250
"With top of radius 4
feet, let's say.",00:06:17.250,00:06:26.640
And depth 10 feet.,00:06:26.640,00:06:31.770
So that's our situation.,00:06:31.770,00:06:34.710
"And then it's being
filled with water.",00:06:34.710,00:06:37.730
"So, is being filled
with water.",00:06:37.730,00:06:42.830
At 2 cubic feet per minute.,00:06:42.830,00:06:49.900
So there is our situation.,00:06:49.900,00:06:52.980
"And then the question is, how
fast is the water rising when",00:06:52.980,00:07:07.580
it is at depth 5 feet?,00:07:07.580,00:07:15.040
"So if this thing is half-full
in the sense, well not",00:07:15.040,00:07:19.670
"half-full in terms
of total volume.",00:07:19.670,00:07:21.770
"But half-full in terms of
height, what's the speed at",00:07:21.770,00:07:29.160
which the water is rising.,00:07:29.160,00:07:36.540
"So, how do we set up
problems like this?",00:07:36.540,00:07:39.970
"Well, we talked about
this last time.",00:07:39.970,00:07:42.240
"The first step is to set up
a diagram and variables.",00:07:42.240,00:07:51.780
"And I'm just going to
draw the picture.",00:07:51.780,00:07:54.450
"And I'm actually going to
draw the picture twice.",00:07:54.450,00:07:58.320
So here's the conical tank.,00:07:58.320,00:08:01.590
"And we have this radius,
which is 4.",00:08:01.590,00:08:05.040
"And we have this height,
which is 10.",00:08:05.040,00:08:07.970
"So that's just to allow me to
think about this problem.",00:08:07.970,00:08:10.950
"Now, it turns out because we
have a varying depth and so",00:08:10.950,00:08:18.730
"on, and this is just the top.",00:08:18.730,00:08:21.730
"That I'd better depict also the
level at which the water",00:08:21.730,00:08:24.530
actually is at present.,00:08:24.530,00:08:26.700
"And furthermore, it's better to
do this schematically, as",00:08:26.700,00:08:30.890
you'll see.,00:08:30.890,00:08:31.830
"So the key point here is to
draw this triangle here.",00:08:31.830,00:08:38.200
"Which shows me the 10 and shows
me the 4, over here.",00:08:38.200,00:08:45.230
"And then imagine that I'm
filling it partway.",00:08:45.230,00:08:48.290
"So maybe we'll put that
water level in in",00:08:48.290,00:08:50.550
another color here.,00:08:50.550,00:08:52.400
So here's the water level.,00:08:52.400,00:08:54.370
"And the water level, I'm going
to depict that horizontal",00:08:54.370,00:08:57.840
"distance here, as r.",00:08:57.840,00:08:59.770
"That's going to be
my variable.",00:08:59.770,00:09:00.950
"That's the radius of the
top of the water.",00:09:00.950,00:09:04.150
"So I'm taking a cross-section
of this, because that",00:09:04.150,00:09:06.980
"geometrically the only thing
I have to keep track of.",00:09:06.980,00:09:10.230
At least initially.,00:09:10.230,00:09:11.820
So this is our water level.,00:09:11.820,00:09:14.630
"And it's really rotated
around.",00:09:14.630,00:09:18.540
"But I'm depicting just this one
half-slice of the picture.",00:09:18.540,00:09:23.130
"And then similarly,
I have the height.",00:09:23.130,00:09:26.300
Which is this dimension there.,00:09:26.300,00:09:30.390
"Or, if you like, the
depth of the water.",00:09:30.390,00:09:32.570
"So the water has filled us up,
up to this point here.",00:09:32.570,00:09:42.140
"So I set it up this way so that
it's clear that we have",00:09:42.140,00:09:46.850
two triangles here.,00:09:46.850,00:09:47.450
"And that one piece of
information we can get from",00:09:47.450,00:09:50.210
"the geometry is the similar
triangles information.",00:09:50.210,00:09:53.880
"Namely, that r / h = 4 / 10.",00:09:53.880,00:09:59.870
"So this is by far the most
typical geometric fact that",00:09:59.870,00:10:09.950
"you'll have to glean
from a picture.",00:10:09.950,00:10:13.450
"So that's one piece of
information that we get from",00:10:13.450,00:10:17.280
this picture.,00:10:17.280,00:10:18.920
"Now, the second thing we have
to do is set up formulas for",00:10:18.920,00:10:23.250
"the volume of water,
and then figure out",00:10:23.250,00:10:26.470
what's going on here.,00:10:26.470,00:10:27.330
"So the volume of water
is, of a cone.",00:10:27.330,00:10:33.460
"So again, you have to know
something about geometry to do",00:10:33.460,00:10:37.360
"many of these problems. So you
have to know that the volume",00:10:37.360,00:10:40.290
"of a cone is 1/3 base
times height.",00:10:40.290,00:10:44.500
"Now, this one is upside down.",00:10:44.500,00:10:45.900
"The base is on the top and it's
going down but it works",00:10:45.900,00:10:50.020
the same way.,00:10:50.020,00:10:50.720
That doesn't affect volume.,00:10:50.720,00:10:52.270
"So it's 1/3 and the base is
pi r^2, that's the base.",00:10:52.270,00:10:57.450
"And times h, which
is the height.",00:10:57.450,00:11:01.890
"So this is the setup
for this problem.",00:11:01.890,00:11:06.290
"And now, having our
relationship, we have one",00:11:06.290,00:11:12.270
"relationship left that
we have to remember.",00:11:12.270,00:11:14.580
"Because we have one
more piece of",00:11:14.580,00:11:15.920
information in this problem.,00:11:15.920,00:11:17.630
"Namely, how fast the
volume is changing.",00:11:17.630,00:11:20.990
"It's going at 2 cubic
feet per minute.",00:11:20.990,00:11:22.960
"It's increasing, so that
means that dv / dt = 2.",00:11:22.960,00:11:29.740
"So I've now gotten rid of all
the words and I have only",00:11:29.740,00:11:35.340
formulas left.,00:11:35.340,00:11:38.010
"I started here with the words,
I drew some pictures, and I",00:11:38.010,00:11:43.960
derived some formulas.,00:11:43.960,00:11:44.740
"Actually, there's one
thing missing.",00:11:44.740,00:11:46.200
What's missing?,00:11:46.200,00:11:49.930
Yeah.,00:11:49.930,00:11:52.570
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:11:52.570,00:11:57.230
PROFESSOR: Exactly.,00:11:57.230,00:11:57.740
What you want to find.,00:11:57.740,00:11:58.420
"What I left out is
the question.",00:11:58.420,00:12:00.690
"So the question is, what
is dh / dt when h = 5?",00:12:00.690,00:12:15.110
So that's the question here.,00:12:15.110,00:12:20.600
"Now, we've got the whole problem
and we never have to",00:12:20.600,00:12:22.630
look at it again if you like.,00:12:22.630,00:12:25.510
"We just have to pay attention
to this piece here.",00:12:25.510,00:12:32.610
So let's carry it out.,00:12:32.610,00:12:34.780
So what happens here.,00:12:34.780,00:12:36.870
"So look, you could do this by
implicit differentiation.",00:12:36.870,00:12:39.190
"But it's so easy to express r
as a function of h that that",00:12:39.190,00:12:43.180
seems kind of foolish.,00:12:43.180,00:12:44.560
So let's write r as 2/5 h.,00:12:44.560,00:12:48.900
"That's coming from this
first equation here.",00:12:48.900,00:12:51.280
"And then let's substitute
that in.",00:12:51.280,00:12:53.800
"That means that v = 1/3
pi ( 2/5 h^2) h.",00:12:53.800,00:13:04.810
"And now I have to differentiate
that.",00:13:04.810,00:13:06.630
"So now I will use implicit
differentiation.",00:13:06.630,00:13:08.850
"It's very foolish at this point
to take cube roots to",00:13:08.850,00:13:12.200
solve for h.,00:13:12.200,00:13:13.320
"You just get yourself into
a bunch of junk.",00:13:13.320,00:13:16.080
"So there is a stage at which
we're still using implicit",00:13:16.080,00:13:18.580
differentiation here.,00:13:18.580,00:13:19.490
"I'm not going to try to solve
for h as a function of v.",00:13:19.490,00:13:24.780
"Instead I'm just differentiating
straight out",00:13:24.780,00:13:26.700
"from this formula, which
is relatively easy to",00:13:26.700,00:13:28.620
differentiate.,00:13:28.620,00:13:29.530
"So this is dv / dt, which
of course = 2 and if I",00:13:29.530,00:13:36.210
"differentiate it I just get this
constant, pi / 3, this",00:13:36.210,00:13:39.640
"other constant, (2/5)^2.",00:13:39.640,00:13:42.390
"And then I have to differentiate
h^3.",00:13:42.390,00:13:45.200
(h^2)h.,00:13:45.200,00:13:47.290
So that's 3h^2 ( dh / dt).,00:13:47.290,00:13:53.140
That's the chain rule.,00:13:53.140,00:13:59.760
"So now let's plug in
all of our numbers.",00:13:59.760,00:14:02.080
"Again, the other theme is, you
don't plug in numbers, fixed",00:14:02.080,00:14:07.110
"numbers, until everything
has stopped moving.",00:14:07.110,00:14:09.600
"At this point, we've
already calculated",00:14:09.600,00:14:11.640
our rates of change.,00:14:11.640,00:14:12.790
"So now I can put
in the numbers.",00:14:12.790,00:14:14.140
"So, 2 = pi 3 ( 2/5)^2( 3), and
then h was 5, so this is 5^2.",00:14:14.140,00:14:26.010
And then I have dh / dt.,00:14:26.010,00:14:27.870
"There's only one unknown thing
left in this problem,",00:14:27.870,00:14:31.600
which is dh / dt.,00:14:31.600,00:14:32.560
Everything else is a number.,00:14:32.560,00:14:33.990
"And if you do all the
cancellations, you see that",00:14:33.990,00:14:36.800
this cancels this.,00:14:36.800,00:14:38.210
"One of the 2's cancels - well,
this cancels this.",00:14:38.210,00:14:41.280
"And then one of the
2's cancels that.",00:14:41.280,00:14:42.690
"So all-told what we have here
is that dh / dt = 1 / 2 pi.",00:14:42.690,00:14:54.080
"And so that happens to
be feet per second.",00:14:54.080,00:14:58.700
This is the whole story.,00:14:58.700,00:15:04.610
"Questions, way back there.",00:15:04.610,00:15:05.680
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:15:05.680,00:15:10.040
"PROFESSOR: Where did I get --
the question is where did I",00:15:10.040,00:15:11.630
get r = 2/5 h from.,00:15:11.630,00:15:14.590
"The answer was, it came from
similar triangles,",00:15:14.590,00:15:17.680
which is over here.,00:15:17.680,00:15:19.020
"I did this similar
triangle thing.",00:15:19.020,00:15:20.380
"And I got this relationship
here. r / h = 4/10, but then I",00:15:20.380,00:15:26.280
"canceled it, got 2/5 and
brought the h over.",00:15:26.280,00:15:31.790
"Another question, over here.",00:15:31.790,00:15:32.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:15:32.890,00:15:45.470
"PROFESSOR: The question
was the following.",00:15:45.470,00:15:53.100
"Suppose you're at this
stage, can you write",00:15:53.100,00:15:56.020
from here dv / dh.,00:15:56.020,00:15:58.310
"So, suppose you're here.",00:15:58.310,00:15:59.560
And work out what this is.,00:15:59.560,00:16:01.390
"It's going to end up being
some constant times h^2.",00:16:01.390,00:16:05.030
"And then also use dv / dt
= dv / dh ( dh / dt).",00:16:05.030,00:16:14.990
Which the chain rule.,00:16:14.990,00:16:17.520
And the answer is yes.,00:16:17.520,00:16:20.830
"We can do that, and indeed
that is what my",00:16:20.830,00:16:24.500
next sentence is.,00:16:24.500,00:16:26.310
"That's exactly what
I'm saying.",00:16:26.310,00:16:27.750
"So when I said this
- sorry, when you",00:16:27.750,00:16:30.240
"said this, I did that.",00:16:30.240,00:16:32.780
That's exactly what I did.,00:16:32.780,00:16:34.080
This chunk is exactly dv / dh.,00:16:34.080,00:16:41.110
That's just what I'm doing.,00:16:41.110,00:16:43.390
OK.,00:16:43.390,00:16:44.730
"So, definitely, that's
what I had in mind.",00:16:44.730,00:16:48.750
"Yeah, another question.",00:16:48.750,00:16:49.760
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:16:49.760,00:16:55.280
"PROFESSOR: You're asking
me whether my",00:16:55.280,00:16:56.730
arithmetic is right or not?,00:16:56.730,00:16:58.040
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:16:58.040,00:17:03.890
PROFESSOR: Pi - per second.,00:17:03.890,00:17:06.850
Oh.,00:17:06.850,00:17:07.350
"This should - no, OK, right.",00:17:07.350,00:17:09.480
I guess it's per minute.,00:17:09.480,00:17:11.560
"Since the other one
is per minute.",00:17:11.560,00:17:12.890
Thank you.,00:17:12.890,00:17:14.400
Yes.,00:17:14.400,00:17:16.810
Was there another question?,00:17:16.810,00:17:17.880
"Probably also fixing my
seconds to minutes.",00:17:17.880,00:17:21.810
Way back there.,00:17:21.810,00:17:23.150
"STUDENT: I don't understand,
why did you",00:17:23.150,00:17:26.601
have to do all that.,00:17:26.601,00:17:27.490
"Isn't the speed 2 cubic
feet per minute?",00:17:27.490,00:17:30.930
"PROFESSOR: The speed at which
you're filling it is 2 cubic",00:17:30.930,00:17:34.020
"feet, but the water level is
rising at a different rate,",00:17:34.020,00:17:37.540
"depending on whether you're
low down or high up.",00:17:37.540,00:17:40.350
"It depends on how wide the
pond, the surface, is.",00:17:40.350,00:17:44.220
So in fact it's not.,00:17:44.220,00:17:45.310
"In fact, the answer wasn't
2 cubic - it wasn't.",00:17:45.310,00:17:48.950
There's a rate there.,00:17:48.950,00:17:49.900
"That is, that's how much
volume is being added.",00:17:49.900,00:17:52.090
"But then there's another number
that we're keeping",00:17:52.090,00:17:54.250
"track of, which is the height.",00:17:54.250,00:17:55.780
"Or, if you like, the
depth of the water.",00:17:55.780,00:17:58.790
OK.,00:17:58.790,00:18:00.030
"So this is the whole point
about related rates.",00:18:00.030,00:18:01.750
"Is you have one variable,
which is v, which",00:18:01.750,00:18:03.850
is volume of something.,00:18:03.850,00:18:05.360
"You have another variable,
which is h, which is the",00:18:05.360,00:18:07.010
"height of the cone
of water there.",00:18:07.010,00:18:10.750
"And you're keeping track
of one variable in",00:18:10.750,00:18:12.260
terms of the other.,00:18:12.260,00:18:13.300
"And the relationship will always
be a chain rule type of",00:18:13.300,00:18:16.360
relationship.,00:18:16.360,00:18:17.140
"So, therefore, you'll be able to
- if you know one you'll be",00:18:17.140,00:18:19.110
able to figure out the other.,00:18:19.110,00:18:20.810
"Provided you get all of
the related rates.",00:18:20.810,00:18:22.890
"These are what are called
related rates.",00:18:22.890,00:18:24.530
"This is a rate of something
with respect to",00:18:24.530,00:18:26.010
"something, etc. etc.",00:18:26.010,00:18:28.050
"So it's really all about
the chain rule.",00:18:28.050,00:18:30.540
"And just fitting it to word
problems. So there's a couple",00:18:30.540,00:18:40.980
of examples.,00:18:40.980,00:18:41.900
"And I'll let you work
out some more.",00:18:41.900,00:18:44.430
"So now, the next thing that I
want to do is to give you one",00:18:44.430,00:18:50.870
more max-min problem.,00:18:50.870,00:18:54.080
"Which has to do with this
device, which I",00:18:54.080,00:18:58.740
brought with me.,00:18:58.740,00:19:00.400
So this is a ring.,00:19:00.400,00:19:02.480
"Happens to be a napkin ring,
and this is some parachute",00:19:02.480,00:19:05.900
"string, which I use when
I go backpacking.",00:19:05.900,00:19:09.450
"And the question is if you have
a - you think of this is",00:19:09.450,00:19:15.890
"a weight, it's flexible.",00:19:15.890,00:19:17.090
"It's allowed to move
along here.",00:19:17.090,00:19:19.040
"And the question is, if I fix
these two ends where my two",00:19:19.040,00:19:23.480
"hands are, where my right hand
is here and where my left hand",00:19:23.480,00:19:26.400
is over there.,00:19:26.400,00:19:28.410
"And the question is, where does
this ring settle down.",00:19:28.410,00:19:32.500
"Now, it's obvious, or should be
maybe obvious, is that if",00:19:32.500,00:19:35.530
"my two hands are at equal
heights, it should settle in",00:19:35.530,00:19:39.060
the middle.,00:19:39.060,00:19:41.420
"The question that we're trying
to resolve is what if one hand",00:19:41.420,00:19:44.020
"is a little higher
than the other.",00:19:44.020,00:19:47.290
"What happens, or if
the other way.",00:19:47.290,00:19:49.040
Where does it settle down?,00:19:49.040,00:19:52.370
"So in order to depict this
problem properly, I need two",00:19:52.370,00:19:55.720
volunteers to help me out.,00:19:55.720,00:19:57.480
Can I have some help?,00:19:57.480,00:20:00.400
OK.,00:20:00.400,00:20:03.370
"So I need one of you to hold the
right side, and one of you",00:20:03.370,00:20:06.320
to hold the left side.,00:20:06.320,00:20:08.460
OK.,00:20:08.460,00:20:09.260
"And just hold it against
the blackboard.",00:20:09.260,00:20:11.180
We're going to trace.,00:20:11.180,00:20:12.240
"So stick it about here, in
the middle somewhere.",00:20:12.240,00:20:15.680
"And now we want to make sure
that this one is a little",00:20:15.680,00:20:17.440
"higher, alright?",00:20:17.440,00:20:18.960
"So we'll have to - yeah, let's
get a little higher up.",00:20:18.960,00:20:22.430
That's probably good enough.,00:20:22.430,00:20:25.730
"So the experiment
has been done.",00:20:25.730,00:20:29.770
"We now see where
this thing is.",00:20:29.770,00:20:31.100
"But, so now hold on tight.",00:20:31.100,00:20:33.810
This thing stretches.,00:20:33.810,00:20:35.960
"So we want to get it stretched
so that we can",00:20:35.960,00:20:38.200
see what it is properly.,00:20:38.200,00:20:40.960
"So this thing isn't heavy enough
for this demonstration.",00:20:40.960,00:20:43.000
"I should've had a ten-ton
brick attached there.",00:20:43.000,00:20:46.480
"But if I did that, than I would
tax my, right, I would",00:20:46.480,00:20:50.230
tax your abilities to.,00:20:50.230,00:20:52.090
"Right, so we're going to try
to trace out what the",00:20:52.090,00:20:54.400
possibilities are here.,00:20:54.400,00:21:03.810
"So this is, roughly speaking,
where this thing - and so now",00:21:03.810,00:21:06.990
where does it settle.,00:21:06.990,00:21:07.960
"Well, it settles about here.",00:21:07.960,00:21:10.550
"So we're going to put that
as x marks the spot.",00:21:10.550,00:21:12.630
"OK, thank you very much.",00:21:12.630,00:21:15.900
"Got to remember where
those dots --",00:21:15.900,00:21:18.230
"OK, all right.",00:21:18.230,00:21:20.960
"Sorry, I forgot to
mark the spots.",00:21:20.960,00:21:24.040
"OK, so here's the situation.",00:21:24.040,00:21:27.410
We have a problem.,00:21:27.410,00:21:29.860
And we've hung a string.,00:21:29.860,00:21:33.170
"And it went down like this and
then it went like that.",00:21:33.170,00:21:39.630
"And we discovered where
it settled.",00:21:39.630,00:21:43.710
Physically.,00:21:43.710,00:21:44.750
"So we want to explain this
mathematically, and see what's",00:21:44.750,00:21:47.820
going on with this problem.,00:21:47.820,00:21:49.280
"So this is a real-life
problem.",00:21:49.280,00:21:50.940
"It honestly is the problem you
have to solve if you want to",00:21:50.940,00:21:53.240
build a bridge.,00:21:53.240,00:21:54.000
"Like, a suspension bridge.",00:21:54.000,00:21:55.570
"This, among many problems.
It's a very serious and",00:21:55.570,00:21:58.130
important problem.,00:21:58.130,00:21:59.350
"And this is the simplest
one of this type.",00:21:59.350,00:22:02.940
So we've got our shape here.,00:22:02.940,00:22:04.990
"This should be a straight
line, maybe not quite as",00:22:04.990,00:22:07.770
angled as that.,00:22:07.770,00:22:10.920
"The first, we've already drawn
the diagram and we've more or",00:22:10.920,00:22:13.520
"less visualized what's
going on here.",00:22:13.520,00:22:16.010
"But the first step after the
diagram is to give letters.",00:22:16.010,00:22:21.460
"Is to label things
appropriately.",00:22:21.460,00:22:24.630
"And I do not expect you
to be able to do",00:22:24.630,00:22:27.270
"this, at this stage.",00:22:27.270,00:22:29.170
"Because it requires a
lot of experience.",00:22:29.170,00:22:31.390
"But I'm going to
do it for you.",00:22:31.390,00:22:33.040
We're going to just do that.,00:22:33.040,00:22:34.630
"So the simplest thing
to do is to use the",00:22:34.630,00:22:37.390
coordinates of the plane.,00:22:37.390,00:22:39.800
"And if you do that, it's also
easiest to use the origin.",00:22:39.800,00:22:43.750
"My favorite number is 0 and
it should be yours, too.",00:22:43.750,00:22:46.590
"So we're going to make
this point be (0, 0).",00:22:46.590,00:22:51.420
"Now, there's another fixed
point in this problem.",00:22:51.420,00:22:54.550
And it's this point over here.,00:22:54.550,00:22:57.200
"And we don't know what
its coordinates are.",00:22:57.200,00:22:58.880
"So we're just going to give
them letters, a and b.",00:22:58.880,00:23:00.850
"But those letters are
going to be fixed",00:23:00.850,00:23:02.790
numbers in this problem.,00:23:02.790,00:23:06.110
"And we want to solve it for
all possible a's and b's.",00:23:06.110,00:23:08.840
"Now, the interesting thing,
remember, is what happens when",00:23:08.840,00:23:11.400
b Is not 0.,00:23:11.400,00:23:12.630
"If b = 0, we already have a clue
that the point should be",00:23:12.630,00:23:16.250
the center point.,00:23:16.250,00:23:16.950
"It should be exactly that x,
the middle point, which I'm",00:23:16.950,00:23:19.440
"going to label in a second,
is halfway in between.",00:23:19.440,00:23:22.730
"So now the variable point that
I'm going to use is down here.",00:23:22.730,00:23:25.930
"I'm going to call this
point (x, y).",00:23:25.930,00:23:30.220
So here's my setup.,00:23:30.220,00:23:31.600
"I've now given labels
to all the things on",00:23:31.600,00:23:34.760
the diagram so far.,00:23:34.760,00:23:37.800
"Most of the things
on the diagram.",00:23:37.800,00:23:42.260
"So now, what else
do I have to do?",00:23:42.260,00:23:47.700
"Well, I have to explain
to you that this is a",00:23:47.700,00:23:54.930
minimization problem.,00:23:54.930,00:23:56.850
"What happens, actually,
physically is that the weight",00:23:56.850,00:24:01.270
settles to the lowest point.,00:24:01.270,00:24:03.050
"That's the thing that has the
lowest potential energy.",00:24:03.050,00:24:05.820
"So we're minimizing
a function.",00:24:05.820,00:24:09.370
And it's this curve here.,00:24:09.370,00:24:13.260
"The constraint is that we're
restricted to this curve.",00:24:13.260,00:24:17.000
So this is a constraint curve.,00:24:17.000,00:24:18.660
"And we want the lowest
point of this curve.",00:24:18.660,00:24:24.590
"So now, we need a little bit
more language in order to",00:24:24.590,00:24:29.160
"describe what it is
that we've got.",00:24:29.160,00:24:31.180
"And the constraint curve, we
got it in a particular way.",00:24:31.180,00:24:36.500
"Namely, we strung some string
from here to there.",00:24:36.500,00:24:39.320
"And what happens at all these
points is that the total",00:24:39.320,00:24:41.980
"length of the string
is the same.",00:24:41.980,00:24:45.920
"So one way of expressing the
constraint is that the length",00:24:45.920,00:24:49.300
of the string is constant.,00:24:49.300,00:24:52.270
"And so in order to figure out
what the constraint is, what",00:24:52.270,00:24:54.690
"this curve is, I have to
describe that analytically.",00:24:54.690,00:24:58.120
"And I'm going to do that by
drawing in some helping lines.",00:24:58.120,00:25:01.830
"Namely, some right triangles
to figure out",00:25:01.830,00:25:03.720
what this length is.,00:25:03.720,00:25:05.400
And what the other length is.,00:25:05.400,00:25:07.290
"So this length is pretty
easy if I draw a",00:25:07.290,00:25:09.550
right triangle here.,00:25:09.550,00:25:11.410
"Because we go over x
and we go down y.",00:25:11.410,00:25:14.410
"So this length is the square
root of x^2 + y^2.",00:25:14.410,00:25:19.150
"That's the Pythagorean
theorem.",00:25:19.150,00:25:22.420
"Similarly, over here, I'm going
to get another length.",00:25:22.420,00:25:26.200
"Which is a little
bit of a mess.",00:25:26.200,00:25:28.360
It's the vertical.,00:25:28.360,00:25:30.670
"So I'm just going to label one
half of it, so that you see.",00:25:30.670,00:25:35.290
"So this horizontal
distance is x.",00:25:35.290,00:25:38.600
"And this horizontal distance
from this top point with this",00:25:38.600,00:25:41.810
"right angle, over there.",00:25:41.810,00:25:44.000
It starts at x and ends at a.,00:25:44.000,00:25:47.660
"The right-most point is
a in the x coordinate.",00:25:47.660,00:25:50.820
"So the whole distance
is a - x.",00:25:50.820,00:25:56.150
"So that's this leg of
this right triangle.",00:25:56.150,00:26:00.700
"And, similarly, the vertical
distance will be b - y.",00:26:00.700,00:26:05.770
"And so, the formula here, which
is a little complicated",00:26:05.770,00:26:08.300
"for this length, is the square
root of (a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2.",00:26:08.300,00:26:17.160
"So here are the two formulas
that are going to allow me to",00:26:17.160,00:26:21.430
set up my problem now.,00:26:21.430,00:26:22.460
"So, my goal is to set
it up the way I did",00:26:22.460,00:26:24.450
"here, just with formulas.",00:26:24.450,00:26:26.940
"And not with diagrams
and not with names.",00:26:26.940,00:26:40.590
So here's what I'd like to do.,00:26:40.590,00:26:42.910
"I claim that what's constrained,
if I'm along that",00:26:42.910,00:26:46.190
"curve, is that the total
length is constant.",00:26:46.190,00:26:48.910
So that's this statement here.,00:26:48.910,00:26:50.730
"The square root of x^2 + y^2
+ this other square root.",00:26:50.730,00:26:55.830
"These are the two lengths
of string.",00:26:55.830,00:27:02.360
"Is equal to some number,
L, which is constant.",00:27:02.360,00:27:08.210
"And this, as I said, is what
I'm calling my constraint.",00:27:08.210,00:27:16.040
Yeah.,00:27:16.040,00:27:16.290
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:27:16.290,00:27:20.480
"PROFESSOR: So the question is,
shouldn't it be b plus y.",00:27:20.480,00:27:24.750
"No, and the reason is that
y is a negative number.",00:27:24.750,00:27:28.210
It's below 0.,00:27:28.210,00:27:30.300
"So it's actually the sum, -
y is a positive number.",00:27:30.300,00:27:39.210
"Alright, so here's
the formula.",00:27:39.210,00:27:43.840
"And then, we want to find the
minimum of something.",00:27:43.840,00:27:53.000
"So what is it that we're
finding the minimum of?",00:27:53.000,00:27:56.250
"This is actually the hardest
part of the problem,",00:27:56.250,00:27:58.370
conceptually.,00:27:58.370,00:27:59.030
"I tried to prepare it,
but it's very hard",00:27:59.030,00:28:01.610
to figure this out.,00:28:01.610,00:28:02.650
We're finding the least what?,00:28:02.650,00:28:07.540
It's y.,00:28:07.540,00:28:10.740
We got a name for that.,00:28:10.740,00:28:11.830
"So we want to find
the lowest y.",00:28:11.830,00:28:17.220
"Now, the reason why it seems
a little weird is you might",00:28:17.220,00:28:20.050
"think of y as just
being a variable.",00:28:20.050,00:28:21.770
"But really, y is a function.",00:28:21.770,00:28:25.180
"It's really y = y ( x ) is
defined implicitly by the",00:28:25.180,00:28:32.800
constraint equation.,00:28:32.800,00:28:34.930
That's what that curve is.,00:28:34.930,00:28:36.420
"And notice the bottom point is
exactly the place where the",00:28:36.420,00:28:42.120
"tangent line will
be horizontal.",00:28:42.120,00:28:46.160
Which is just what we want.,00:28:46.160,00:28:48.180
"So from the diagram, the bottom
point is where y' = 0.",00:28:48.180,00:29:03.600
So this is the critical point.,00:29:03.600,00:29:15.195
Yeah?,00:29:15.195,00:29:25.720
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:29:25.720,00:29:27.540
PROFESSOR: Exactly.,00:29:27.540,00:29:28.440
"So I'm deriving for you, so the
question is, could I have",00:29:28.440,00:29:32.440
"just tried to find y'
= 0 to begin with.",00:29:32.440,00:29:35.590
"The answer is yes, absolutely.",00:29:35.590,00:29:37.390
"And in fact I'm leading
in that direction.",00:29:37.390,00:29:39.070
"I'm just showing you, so I'm
trying to make the following,",00:29:39.070,00:29:42.400
"very subtle, point.",00:29:42.400,00:29:43.930
"Which is in maximum-minimum
problems, we always have to",00:29:43.930,00:29:49.500
keep track of two things.,00:29:49.500,00:29:51.130
"Often the interesting point
is the critical point.",00:29:51.130,00:29:55.110
"And that indeed turns out
to be the case here.",00:29:55.110,00:29:56.840
"But we always have to
check the ends.",00:29:56.840,00:29:59.840
"And so there are several ways
of checking the ends.",00:29:59.840,00:30:02.125
"One is, we did this
physical problem.",00:30:02.125,00:30:03.490
"We can see that it's
coming up here.",00:30:03.490,00:30:05.410
"We can see that it's
coming up here.",00:30:05.410,00:30:06.610
"Therefore the bottom must be
at this critical point.",00:30:06.610,00:30:10.480
"So that's OK, so that's one
way of checking it.",00:30:10.480,00:30:14.140
"Another way of checking it is
the reasoning that I just",00:30:14.140,00:30:17.570
"gave. But it's really
the same reasoning.",00:30:17.570,00:30:19.330
"I'm pointing to this thing and
I'm showing you that the",00:30:19.330,00:30:21.890
"bottom is somewhere
in the middle.",00:30:21.890,00:30:23.010
"So, therefore, it is a place
of horizontal tangency.",00:30:23.010,00:30:26.470
"That's the reasoning
that I'm using.",00:30:26.470,00:30:28.970
"So, again, this is to avoid
having to evaluate a limit of",00:30:28.970,00:30:32.570
"an end or to use the second
derivative test, which is a",00:30:32.570,00:30:35.300
total catastrophe in this case.,00:30:35.300,00:30:42.310
"OK, now.",00:30:42.310,00:30:45.470
"There's one other thing that you
might know about this if",00:30:45.470,00:30:48.780
"you've seen this geometric
construction before.",00:30:48.780,00:30:51.580
With a string and chalk.,00:30:51.580,00:30:54.300
"Which is that this curve
is an eclipse.",00:30:54.300,00:30:58.070
"It turns out, this is a
piece of an eclipse.",00:30:58.070,00:30:59.750
It's a huge ellipse.,00:30:59.750,00:31:00.870
"These two points turn
out to be the",00:31:00.870,00:31:02.280
so-called foci of the ellipse.,00:31:02.280,00:31:05.500
"However, that geometric fact is
totally useless for solving",00:31:05.500,00:31:09.530
this problem.,00:31:09.530,00:31:10.860
Completely useless.,00:31:10.860,00:31:12.390
"If you actually write out the
formulas for the ellipse,",00:31:12.390,00:31:14.850
"you'll discover that you
have a much harder",00:31:14.850,00:31:16.740
problem on your hands.,00:31:16.740,00:31:18.090
"And it will take you twice or
ten times as long, so, it's",00:31:18.090,00:31:22.460
"true that it's an ellipse,
but it doesn't help.",00:31:22.460,00:31:25.670
"OK, so what we're going to do
instead is much simpler.",00:31:25.670,00:31:29.510
"We're going to leave this
expression along and we're",00:31:29.510,00:31:32.660
"just going to differentiate
implicitly.",00:31:32.660,00:31:35.480
"So again, we use implicit
differentiation on the",00:31:35.480,00:31:42.770
constraint equation.,00:31:42.770,00:31:49.430
"So that's the equation which
is directly above me",00:31:49.430,00:31:51.350
"there, at the top.",00:31:51.350,00:31:54.310
"And I have to differentiate
it with respect to x.",00:31:54.310,00:31:57.470
"So that's a little ugly,
but we've done",00:31:57.470,00:31:59.450
this a few times before.,00:31:59.450,00:32:01.080
"When you differentiate a square
root, the square root",00:32:01.080,00:32:03.630
goes into the denominator.,00:32:03.630,00:32:08.230
"And there's a factor of 1/2, so
there's a 2x which cancels.",00:32:08.230,00:32:11.500
So I claim it's this.,00:32:11.500,00:32:12.750
"Now, because y depends on x,
there's also a y y' here.",00:32:12.750,00:32:17.180
"So technically speaking, it's
twice this with a half.",00:32:17.180,00:32:21.930
2 / 2 times that.,00:32:21.930,00:32:24.310
"So that's the differentiation
of the first",00:32:24.310,00:32:26.240
piece of this guy.,00:32:26.240,00:32:30.790
"Now I'm going to do this second
one, and it's also the",00:32:30.790,00:32:33.330
chain rule.,00:32:33.330,00:32:34.060
"But you're just going to have
to let me do it for you.",00:32:34.060,00:32:39.150
"Because it's just a little bit
too long for you to pay",00:32:39.150,00:32:43.230
attention to.,00:32:43.230,00:32:43.880
"It turns out there's a minus
sign that comes out, because",00:32:43.880,00:32:46.580
there's a - x and a - y there.,00:32:46.580,00:32:49.710
"And then the numerator, the
denominator is the same",00:32:49.710,00:32:52.880
massive square root.,00:32:52.880,00:32:55.100
So it's (a - x)^2 ( b - y)^2.,00:32:55.100,00:32:59.920
"And the numerator is a
- x, which is what",00:32:59.920,00:33:05.830
replaces the x over here.,00:33:05.830,00:33:07.750
"And then another term,
which is (b - y)y'.",00:33:07.750,00:33:13.660
"I claim that that's analogous
to what I did",00:33:13.660,00:33:15.960
in the first term.,00:33:15.960,00:33:17.140
"And you'll just have to check
this on your own.",00:33:17.140,00:33:20.110
"Because I did it too
fast for you to be",00:33:20.110,00:33:21.630
able to check yourself.,00:33:21.630,00:33:23.730
"Now, that's going to
be equal to what on",00:33:23.730,00:33:25.300
the right-hand side.,00:33:25.300,00:33:26.190
"What's the derivative of
L with respect to x?",00:33:26.190,00:33:29.510
It's 0.,00:33:29.510,00:33:30.540
"It's not changing
in the problem.",00:33:30.540,00:33:32.300
"Although my parachute
stuff stretches.",00:33:32.300,00:33:37.630
"We tried to stretch it to
its fullest extent.",00:33:37.630,00:33:40.700
"So that we kept it fixed,
that was the goal here.",00:33:40.700,00:33:45.100
"So now, this looks like
a total mess.",00:33:45.100,00:33:50.380
"But, it's not.",00:33:50.380,00:33:52.940
And let me show you why.,00:33:52.940,00:33:54.440
It simplifies a great deal.,00:33:54.440,00:33:57.110
"And let me show you
exactly how.",00:33:57.110,00:34:01.140
"So, first of all, the whole
point is we're looking for the",00:34:01.140,00:34:04.220
place where y' = 0.,00:34:04.220,00:34:06.860
"So that means that these
terms go away. y' = 0.",00:34:06.860,00:34:14.080
So they're gone.,00:34:14.080,00:34:16.690
"And now what we have is the
following equation.",00:34:16.690,00:34:21.070
"It's x / square root of x^2 +
y^2 squared is equal to, if I",00:34:21.070,00:34:27.590
"put it on the other side the
minus sign is changed to a",00:34:27.590,00:34:30.630
"plus sign. a - x divided by this
other massive object, (a",00:34:30.630,00:34:37.130
- x)^2 + (b - y)^2.,00:34:37.130,00:34:43.300
"So this is what it's
simplifies to.",00:34:43.300,00:34:45.510
"Now again, that also might
look complicated to you.",00:34:45.510,00:34:51.020
"But I claim that this is
something, this is a kind of",00:34:51.020,00:34:57.320
"equilibrium equation that can be
interpreted geometrically,",00:34:57.320,00:35:01.980
"in a way that is very meaningful
and important.",00:35:01.980,00:35:05.360
"So first of all, let me observe
for you that this x is",00:35:05.360,00:35:09.330
something on our picture.,00:35:09.330,00:35:10.730
"And the square root
of x^2 + y^2 is",00:35:10.730,00:35:12.760
something on our picture.,00:35:12.760,00:35:14.160
"Namely, if I go over to the
picture, here was x and this",00:35:14.160,00:35:19.230
was a right triangle.,00:35:19.230,00:35:20.760
"And this hypotenuse was square
root of x^2 + y^2.",00:35:20.760,00:35:25.700
"So, if I call this angle
alpha, then this",00:35:25.700,00:35:31.680
is the sine of alpha.,00:35:31.680,00:35:34.330
Right?,00:35:34.330,00:35:34.700
"It's a right triangle, that's
the opposite leg.",00:35:34.700,00:35:36.950
"So this guy is the
sine of alpha.",00:35:36.950,00:35:44.940
"Similarly, the other side has
an interpretation for the",00:35:44.940,00:35:48.850
other right triangle.,00:35:48.850,00:35:50.800
"If this angle is beta, then the
opposite side is a - x,",00:35:50.800,00:35:56.245
"and the hypotenuse is what was
in the denominator over there.",00:35:56.245,00:36:00.850
So this side is sine of beta.,00:36:00.850,00:36:10.130
"And so what this condition
is telling us is",00:36:10.130,00:36:14.850
that alpha = beta.,00:36:14.850,00:36:19.230
"Which is the hidden symmetry
in the problem.",00:36:19.230,00:36:22.620
"I don't know if you can actually
see it when I show",00:36:22.620,00:36:25.600
you this thing.,00:36:25.600,00:36:28.490
"But, no matter how I tilt it,
actually the two angles from",00:36:28.490,00:36:33.120
the horizontal are the same.,00:36:33.120,00:36:39.330
"In the middle it's kind
of obvious that that",00:36:39.330,00:36:41.230
should be the case.,00:36:41.230,00:36:42.540
"But on the sides it's
not obvious that",00:36:42.540,00:36:44.510
that's what's happening.,00:36:44.510,00:36:46.820
"Now, this has even, so that's
a symmetry, if you like, of",00:36:46.820,00:36:49.955
the situation.,00:36:49.955,00:36:50.590
These two angles are equal.,00:36:50.590,00:36:52.590
"But there's something
more to be said.",00:36:52.590,00:36:55.440
"If you do a forced diagram for
this, what you'll discover is",00:36:55.440,00:36:58.870
"that the tension on the
two lines is the same.",00:36:58.870,00:37:03.680
"Which means that when you
build something which is",00:37:03.680,00:37:05.980
"hanging like this, it will
involve the least stress.",00:37:05.980,00:37:11.350
"If you hang something very
heavy, and one side carries",00:37:11.350,00:37:14.340
"twice as much load as the other,
then you have twice as",00:37:14.340,00:37:16.700
"much chance of its falling
and breaking.",00:37:16.700,00:37:19.260
"If they each hold the same
strength, then you've",00:37:19.260,00:37:23.090
"distributed the load in a
much more balanced way.",00:37:23.090,00:37:26.320
"So this is a kind of a balance
condition, and it's very",00:37:26.320,00:37:29.170
"typical of minimization
problems. And fortunately,",00:37:29.170,00:37:32.950
"there are nice solutions which
distribute the weight",00:37:32.950,00:37:35.810
reasonably well.,00:37:35.810,00:37:37.020
"That's certainly the principal
of suspension bridges.",00:37:37.020,00:37:41.290
"So yeah, one more question.",00:37:41.290,00:37:42.820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:37:42.820,00:37:44.760
"PROFESSOR: OK, so the question
where it hangs, that is, what",00:37:44.760,00:37:49.480
"the formula for x is and what
the formula for y is.",00:37:49.480,00:37:53.030
"And other things, like the
equation for the ellipse and",00:37:53.030,00:37:56.240
lots of other stuff like that.,00:37:56.240,00:37:58.310
"Those are things that I will
answer for you in a set of",00:37:58.310,00:38:02.030
notes which I will hand out.,00:38:02.030,00:38:03.700
And they're just a mess.,00:38:03.700,00:38:06.310
"You see they're, just as in that
other problem that we did",00:38:06.310,00:38:08.930
"last time, there's some
illuminating things you can",00:38:08.930,00:38:11.940
"say about the problem and then
there's some messy formulas.",00:38:11.940,00:38:15.890
"You know, you want to try to
pick out the simple things",00:38:15.890,00:38:19.270
that you can say.,00:38:19.270,00:38:19.930
"In fact, that's a property of
math, you want to focus on the",00:38:19.930,00:38:23.420
more comprehensible things.,00:38:23.420,00:38:24.500
"On the other hand,
it can be done.",00:38:24.500,00:38:26.770
"It just takes a little
bit of computation.",00:38:26.770,00:38:30.290
"So I didn't answer the
question of what",00:38:30.290,00:38:32.080
the lowest y was.,00:38:32.080,00:38:33.630
But I'll do that for you.,00:38:33.630,00:38:39.020
"Maybe I'll just mention one more
thing about this problem.",00:38:39.020,00:38:42.760
"I'm using problems
from a completely",00:38:42.760,00:38:44.410
different point of view.,00:38:44.410,00:38:45.890
"If you sort of roll the ellipse
around, you get the",00:38:45.890,00:38:50.690
"same phenomenon from
each place here.",00:38:50.690,00:38:55.580
"So it doesn't matter
where a and 0 are.",00:38:55.580,00:38:58.170
"You'll get the same
phenomenon.",00:38:58.170,00:38:59.490
"That is, the tangent line.",00:38:59.490,00:39:02.040
"So, this angle and that
angle will be equal.",00:39:02.040,00:39:06.030
"So you can also read that as
being the angle over here and",00:39:06.030,00:39:10.110
the angle over here are equal.,00:39:10.110,00:39:11.350
"That is, beta, that is
the complementary",00:39:11.350,00:39:14.300
angles are also equal.,00:39:14.300,00:39:17.290
"And if you interpret this as a
ray of light, and this as a",00:39:17.290,00:39:21.730
"mirror, then this would be
saying that if you start at",00:39:21.730,00:39:24.670
"one focus, every ray of light
will bounce and go to the",00:39:24.670,00:39:28.290
other focus.,00:39:28.290,00:39:29.310
"So that's a property that
an ellipse has.",00:39:29.310,00:39:32.690
"More precisely, a property that
this kind of curve has.",00:39:32.690,00:39:36.460
"And in fact, a few years ago
there was this great piece of",00:39:36.460,00:39:41.900
"art at something called the
DeCordova Museum, which I",00:39:41.900,00:39:45.210
"recommended very highly to you
go sometime to visit in your",00:39:45.210,00:39:50.570
four years here.,00:39:50.570,00:39:52.460
"There was a collection of
miniature golf holes.",00:39:52.460,00:39:59.000
"So they had a bunch of mini
golf pieces of art.",00:39:59.000,00:40:02.650
"And every one was completely
different from the other.",00:40:02.650,00:40:04.320
"And one of them was called
hole in one.",00:40:04.320,00:40:07.910
"And the tee was at one
focus of the ellipse.",00:40:07.910,00:40:11.110
"And the hole was at the other
focus of the ellipse.",00:40:11.110,00:40:15.390
"So, no matter how you hit
the golf ball, it always",00:40:15.390,00:40:19.070
goes into the hole.,00:40:19.070,00:40:21.790
"No matter where it bounces,
it just, one bounce",00:40:21.790,00:40:24.595
and it's in the hole.,00:40:24.595,00:40:26.820
"So that's actually a consequence
of the computation",00:40:26.820,00:40:30.550
that we just did.,00:40:30.550,00:40:40.260
Time to go on.,00:40:40.260,00:40:42.170
"We're going to now talk
about something else.",00:40:42.170,00:41:06.150
"So our next topic is
Newton's method.",00:41:06.150,00:41:10.990
"Which is one of the greatest
applications of calculus.",00:41:10.990,00:41:24.020
"And I'm going to describe
it here for you.",00:41:24.020,00:41:27.610
"And we'll illustrate it on an
example, which is solving the",00:41:27.610,00:41:36.940
equation x^2 = 5.,00:41:36.940,00:41:39.970
"We're going to find the
square root of 5.",00:41:39.970,00:41:42.000
"Now, you can actually solve
any equation this way.",00:41:42.000,00:41:45.520
"Any equation that you
understand, you can solve this",00:41:45.520,00:41:47.710
"way, essentially.",00:41:47.710,00:41:49.930
"So even though I'm doing it
for the square root of 5,",00:41:49.930,00:41:52.120
"which is something that you
can figure out on your",00:41:52.120,00:41:54.240
"calculator, in fact this is
really at the heart of many of",00:41:54.240,00:41:59.690
"the ways in which calculators
work.",00:41:59.690,00:42:02.210
"So, the first thing is to
make this problem a",00:42:02.210,00:42:04.310
little bit more abstract.,00:42:04.310,00:42:06.420
"We're going to set f
( x ) = x^2 - 5.",00:42:06.420,00:42:13.830
"And then we're going
to solve f (x) = 0.",00:42:13.830,00:42:19.840
"So this is the sort of
standard form for",00:42:19.840,00:42:22.980
solving such a.,00:42:22.980,00:42:24.120
"So you take some either
complicated or simple function",00:42:24.120,00:42:27.360
"of x, linear functions are
boring, quadratic functions",00:42:27.360,00:42:30.310
are already interesting.,00:42:30.310,00:42:32.550
"And cubic functions, as I've
said a few times, you don't",00:42:32.550,00:42:36.720
"even have formulas
for solving.",00:42:36.720,00:42:37.980
"So this would be the only method
you have for solving",00:42:37.980,00:42:40.295
them numerically.,00:42:40.295,00:42:43.750
So here's how it works.,00:42:43.750,00:42:45.810
"So the idea, I'll plot
this function.",00:42:45.810,00:42:50.010
"Here's the function, it's
a parabola, y = x^2 - 5.",00:42:50.010,00:42:55.810
"It dips below 0, sorry,
it should be",00:42:55.810,00:42:57.600
"centered, but anyway.",00:42:57.600,00:43:01.090
"And now the idea here is
to start with a guess.",00:43:01.090,00:43:06.530
"And square root of 5 is pretty
close to the square root of 4,",00:43:06.530,00:43:11.380
which is 2.,00:43:11.380,00:43:12.360
"So my first guess is going
to be 2, here.",00:43:12.360,00:43:17.030
So start with initial guess.,00:43:17.030,00:43:30.510
So that's our first guess.,00:43:30.510,00:43:32.320
"And now, what we're going to do
is we're going to pretend",00:43:32.320,00:43:37.070
that the function is linear.,00:43:37.070,00:43:40.080
That's all we're going to do.,00:43:40.080,00:43:41.300
"And then if the function were
linear, we're going to try to",00:43:41.300,00:43:45.710
find where the 0 is.,00:43:45.710,00:43:47.550
"So if the function is linear,
what we'll use is we'll plot",00:43:47.550,00:43:50.470
"the point where 2 is on, that
is, the point (2, f ( 2 )),",00:43:50.470,00:43:58.340
"and then we're going to draw
the tangent line here.",00:43:58.340,00:44:06.660
"And this is going to be
our new guess. x = x,",00:44:06.660,00:44:15.810
which I'll call x1.,00:44:15.810,00:44:22.420
"So the idea here is that this
point may be somewhat far from",00:44:22.420,00:44:26.830
"where it crosses, but this point
will be a little closer.",00:44:26.830,00:44:31.250
"And now we're going to do this
over and over again.",00:44:31.250,00:44:33.830
"And see how fast it gets to the
place we're aiming for.",00:44:33.830,00:44:38.340
"So we have to work out what
the formulas are.",00:44:38.340,00:44:42.020
And that's the strategy.,00:44:42.020,00:44:53.700
"So now, the first step here is,
we have our guess, we have",00:44:53.700,00:45:01.730
our tangent line.,00:45:01.730,00:45:06.020
"Which has the formula
y - y0 = m(x - x0).",00:45:06.020,00:45:13.540
"So that's the general form
for a tangent line.",00:45:13.540,00:45:16.220
"And now, I have to tell
you what x1 is.",00:45:16.220,00:45:20.140
"In terms of this tangent line.
x1 is the x intercept.",00:45:20.140,00:45:29.970
"The tangent line, if you look
over here at the diagram, the",00:45:29.970,00:45:33.420
"tangent line is the
orange line.",00:45:33.420,00:45:36.220
"Where that crosses the axis,
that's where I want to put x1.",00:45:36.220,00:45:41.340
So that's the x intercept.,00:45:41.340,00:45:43.530
"Now, how do you find
the x intercept?",00:45:43.530,00:45:46.670
You find it by setting y = 0.,00:45:46.670,00:45:49.760
That horizontal line is y = 0.,00:45:49.760,00:45:52.270
"So I set y = 0, and I get
0 - y0 = m (x1 - x0).",00:45:52.270,00:45:59.790
"So I changed two things
in this equation.",00:45:59.790,00:46:02.300
"I plugged in 0 here, for y.",00:46:02.300,00:46:04.970
"And I said that the place where
that happens is going to",00:46:04.970,00:46:07.340
be where x is x1.,00:46:07.340,00:46:13.050
So now let's solve.,00:46:13.050,00:46:15.530
"And what we get here is -
y divided by - sorry,",00:46:15.530,00:46:19.700
-y0 / m = x1 - x0.,00:46:19.700,00:46:26.390
"And now I can get a
formula for x1.",00:46:26.390,00:46:30.800
So x1 = x0 - (y0 / m).,00:46:30.800,00:46:46.600
"I now need to tell you what this
formula means, in terms",00:46:46.600,00:46:53.580
of the function f.,00:46:53.580,00:46:56.070
"So first of all, x0 is
x0, whatever x0 is.",00:46:56.070,00:46:59.230
"And y0, I claim, is f (x0).",00:46:59.230,00:47:06.230
"And m is the slope at
that same place.",00:47:06.230,00:47:11.080
So it's f' (x0).,00:47:11.080,00:47:17.230
And this is the whole story.,00:47:17.230,00:47:19.650
"This is the formula which will
enable us to calculate",00:47:19.650,00:47:25.440
basically any root.,00:47:25.440,00:47:34.520
"I'm going to repeat this
formula, so I'm going to tell",00:47:34.520,00:47:36.850
"you again what Newton's method
is, and put a little more",00:47:36.850,00:47:40.620
colorful box around it.,00:47:40.620,00:47:43.080
"So Newton's method involves
the following formula.",00:47:43.080,00:47:53.210
"In order to get the n + 1st
point, that's our better and",00:47:53.210,00:47:58.830
"better guess, I'm going to take
the nth one and then I'm",00:47:58.830,00:48:03.070
going to plug in this formula.,00:48:03.070,00:48:04.330
So f ( xn ) / f' ( xn ).,00:48:04.330,00:48:09.870
"So this is the basic formula,
and if you like, this is the",00:48:09.870,00:48:14.010
"idea of just repeating
what I had before.",00:48:14.010,00:48:18.820
"Now, we've gone from geometry,
from just pictures, to an",00:48:18.820,00:48:22.230
"honest to goodness formula
which is completely",00:48:22.230,00:48:24.170
"implementable and very easy
to implement in any case.",00:48:24.170,00:48:29.450
"So let's see how it works in
the case that we've got.",00:48:29.450,00:48:33.540
"Which is x0 = 2.
f(x) = x^2 - 5.",00:48:33.540,00:48:41.160
"Let's see how to implement
this formula.",00:48:41.160,00:48:44.850
"So first of all, I have to
calculate for you, f' (x).",00:48:44.850,00:48:49.920
That's 2x.,00:48:49.920,00:48:55.200
"And so, x1 = x0 -, so
f' , sorry, f ( x )",00:48:55.200,00:49:05.730
would be x0^2 - 5.,00:49:05.730,00:49:08.690
"That's what's in
the numerator.",00:49:08.690,00:49:10.550
"And in the denominator
I have the",00:49:10.550,00:49:11.760
"derivative, so that's 2 x0.",00:49:11.760,00:49:18.820
"And so all told, well, let's
work it out in two steps here.",00:49:18.820,00:49:23.920
"This is - 1/2 x0 for the first
term, and then + (5/2 / x0)",00:49:23.920,00:49:30.800
for the second term.,00:49:30.800,00:49:31.750
"And these two terms combine, so
we have here 1/2 x0 + 5/2",00:49:31.750,00:49:40.450
with an x0 in the denominator.,00:49:40.450,00:49:43.010
"So here's the formula for
x1. in this case.",00:49:43.010,00:49:53.310
"Now I'd like to show you
how well this works.",00:49:53.310,00:50:03.620
"So first of all, we have x1 =
1/2 ( 2), if I plug in x1, +",00:50:03.620,00:50:11.150
"5/4, which is 9/4.",00:50:11.150,00:50:16.630
"And x2, I have 1/2 (
9/4) + 5/2 ( 4/9).",00:50:16.630,00:50:28.550
That's the next one.,00:50:28.550,00:50:30.360
"And if you work this
out, it's 161/72.",00:50:30.360,00:50:37.610
And then x3 is kind of long.,00:50:37.610,00:50:41.340
"But I will just write down what
it is, so that you can",00:50:41.340,00:50:43.510
"see it's 1/2 ( 161/72) +
5/2 and then I do the",00:50:43.510,00:50:49.580
reciprocal of that.,00:50:49.580,00:50:50.600
So 72/161.,00:50:50.600,00:50:56.620
"So let's see how
good these are.",00:50:56.620,00:51:00.770
"I carefully calculated
how far off they are.",00:51:00.770,00:51:05.850
Somewhere on my notes.,00:51:05.850,00:51:07.510
"So I'll just take a look
and see what I said.",00:51:07.510,00:51:11.660
"Oh yeah, I did do it.",00:51:11.660,00:51:13.930
"So, what's the square root of 5
minus - so here's n, here's",00:51:13.930,00:51:20.870
"the square root of 5
- xn, if you like.",00:51:20.870,00:51:24.420
Or the other way around.,00:51:24.420,00:51:26.800
The size of this.,00:51:26.800,00:51:28.900
"You'll have to decide on your
homework whether it comes out",00:51:28.900,00:51:32.300
"positive or negative,
to the right or to",00:51:32.300,00:51:34.200
the left of the answer.,00:51:34.200,00:51:35.660
But let's do this.,00:51:35.660,00:51:37.460
"So when n = 0, the
guess was 2.",00:51:37.460,00:51:41.070
"And we're off by about
2 ( 10 ^ - 1).",00:51:41.070,00:51:45.330
"And if n = 1, so that's this
9/4, that's off by",00:51:45.330,00:51:50.090
about 10 ^ - 2.,00:51:50.090,00:51:53.120
"And then n = 2, that's this
number here, right?",00:51:53.120,00:51:58.240
"And that's off by about
4 ( 10 ^ - 5).",00:51:58.240,00:52:03.540
"That's already as good an
approximation to the square",00:52:03.540,00:52:06.270
"root of 5 as you'll ever
need in your life.",00:52:06.270,00:52:10.450
"If you do 3, this number here
turns out to be accurate to 10",00:52:10.450,00:52:18.190
^ - 10 or so.,00:52:18.190,00:52:20.140
"This goes right off
to the edge of my",00:52:20.140,00:52:22.190
"calculator, this one here.",00:52:22.190,00:52:23.890
"So already, with the third
iterate. you're of way past",00:52:23.890,00:52:29.270
"the accuracy that you need
for most things.",00:52:29.270,00:52:31.340
"Yep, question.",00:52:31.340,00:52:32.070
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:52:32.070,00:52:32.200
"PROFESSOR: How come
the x0 disappears?",00:52:32.200,00:52:38.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:52:38.660,00:52:39.820
"PROFESSOR: So, from here
to here [INAUDIBLE]",00:52:39.820,00:52:56.010
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:52:56.010,00:52:56.380
"PROFESSOR: Hang on, folks,
we have a question.",00:52:56.380,00:52:58.280
Let's just answer it.,00:52:58.280,00:52:59.390
"So here we have an x0, and here
we have - 1/2, there's an",00:52:59.390,00:53:03.220
x0^2 and an x which cancel.,00:53:03.220,00:53:08.050
"And here we have a minus,
and a - 5/2 x0.",00:53:08.050,00:53:11.480
"So I combine the 1 - 1/2,
I got + 1/2, that's all.",00:53:11.480,00:53:16.150
OK?,00:53:16.150,00:53:17.680
"Alright, thanks.",00:53:17.680,00:53:18.890
"We'll have to ask other
questions after class.",00:53:18.890,00:53:21.910
