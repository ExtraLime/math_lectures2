"As an introduction to the main
topic of this lecture",00:00:00.400,00:00:02.890
"sequence, let us go through a
simple example and on the way,",00:00:02.890,00:00:06.520
"review what we have
learned so far.",00:00:06.520,00:00:08.830
"The example that we're going
to consider involves three",00:00:08.830,00:00:11.670
tosses of a biased coin.,00:00:11.670,00:00:14.660
"It's a coin that results in
heads with probability p.",00:00:14.660,00:00:19.150
"We're going to make this
a little more precise.",00:00:19.150,00:00:21.350
"And the coin is biased in the
sense that this number p is",00:00:21.350,00:00:24.560
"not necessarily the
same as one half.",00:00:24.560,00:00:27.250
"We represent this particular
probabilistic experiment in",00:00:27.250,00:00:31.130
"terms a tree that shows us the
different stages of the",00:00:31.130,00:00:35.290
experiment.,00:00:35.290,00:00:36.570
"Each particular branch
corresponds to a sequence of",00:00:36.570,00:00:39.710
"possible results in the
different stages, and the",00:00:39.710,00:00:42.710
"leaves of this tree correspond
to the possible outcomes.",00:00:42.710,00:00:46.500
"The branches of this tree are
annotated by certain numbers,",00:00:46.500,00:00:50.030
"and these numbers are to be
interpreted appropriately as",00:00:50.030,00:00:52.810
"probabilities or conditional
probabilities.",00:00:52.810,00:00:55.360
"So for example, this number
here is interpreted as the",00:00:55.360,00:00:59.190
"probability of heads in the
first toss, an event that we",00:00:59.190,00:01:02.930
denote as H1.,00:01:02.930,00:01:05.140
"This number here is to be
interpreted as a conditional",00:01:05.140,00:01:08.800
probability.,00:01:08.800,00:01:10.150
"It's the conditional probability
of obtaining heads",00:01:10.150,00:01:12.760
"in the second toss given
that the first",00:01:12.760,00:01:15.900
toss resulted in heads.,00:01:15.900,00:01:18.230
"And finally, this number here
is to be interpreted as the",00:01:18.230,00:01:21.900
"conditional probability of heads
in the third toss, given",00:01:21.900,00:01:27.650
"that the first toss resulted in
heads and the second toss",00:01:27.650,00:01:31.510
also resulted in heads.,00:01:31.510,00:01:33.390
"Let us now continue with
some calculations.",00:01:36.210,00:01:39.086
"First, we're going to practice
the multiplication rule, which",00:01:42.160,00:01:47.070
"allows us to calculate
the probability",00:01:47.070,00:01:49.539
of a certain outcome.,00:01:49.539,00:01:52.400
"In this case, the outcome of
interest is tails followed by",00:01:52.400,00:01:56.690
heads followed by tails.,00:01:56.690,00:01:58.990
"So we're talking about this
particular outcome here.",00:01:58.990,00:02:02.070
"According to the multiplication
rule, to find",00:02:02.070,00:02:04.580
"the probability of a particular
final outcome, we",00:02:04.580,00:02:08.320
"multiply probabilities and
conditional probabilities",00:02:08.320,00:02:11.590
"along the path that leads to
this particular outcome.",00:02:11.590,00:02:14.980
"So in this case, it's (1 minus
p) times p times (1 minus p).",00:02:14.980,00:02:21.790
"Let us now calculate
the probability",00:02:21.790,00:02:24.280
of a certain event.,00:02:24.280,00:02:26.210
"The event of interest is the
event that we obtain exactly",00:02:26.210,00:02:29.760
one head in the three tosses.,00:02:29.760,00:02:32.579
"This is an event that can
happen in multiple ways.",00:02:32.579,00:02:35.200
"Here is one possibility where
we have a single head.",00:02:35.200,00:02:39.280
Here's another possibility.,00:02:39.280,00:02:41.360
And here's a third one.,00:02:41.360,00:02:42.860
"These are the three possible
ways that we can have exactly",00:02:42.860,00:02:46.740
"one head, depending
on where exactly",00:02:46.740,00:02:50.160
that single head appears.,00:02:50.160,00:02:52.210
"Is it in the first toss, in the
second, or in the third.",00:02:52.210,00:02:55.550
"To find the total probability of
this event, we need to add",00:02:55.550,00:02:59.520
"the probability of the different
outcomes that",00:02:59.520,00:03:01.950
correspond to this event.,00:03:01.950,00:03:04.450
"The probability of this outcome
is p times (1 minus p)",00:03:04.450,00:03:07.490
"squared, the probability of
this outcome is what we",00:03:07.490,00:03:10.420
calculated.,00:03:10.420,00:03:11.180
"It's, again, p times (1
minus p) squared.",00:03:11.180,00:03:13.490
"And the probability of the third
one is also p times 1",00:03:13.490,00:03:16.460
minus p squared.,00:03:16.460,00:03:17.829
"So the answer is 3p times
(1 minus p) squared.",00:03:17.829,00:03:22.290
"Notice that each one of the 3
different ways that this event",00:03:22.290,00:03:27.390
"can happen have the
same probability.",00:03:27.390,00:03:30.620
"So these 3 outcomes are
equally likely.",00:03:30.620,00:03:34.270
"Finally, let us calculate a
conditional probability.",00:03:34.270,00:03:39.390
"And this is essentially
the Bayes rule.",00:03:39.390,00:03:42.420
"Suppose that we were told that
there was exactly one head.",00:03:42.420,00:03:46.250
"So in particular, the blue
event has occurred.",00:03:46.250,00:03:50.590
"And we're interested in the
probability that the first",00:03:50.590,00:03:53.820
"toss is heads, which
corresponds",00:03:53.820,00:03:57.940
to this event here.,00:03:57.940,00:04:00.080
"These are all the outcomes
in which the first",00:04:00.080,00:04:02.710
toss is equal to heads.,00:04:02.710,00:04:06.140
"So given that the blue event
happened, what is the",00:04:06.140,00:04:09.350
"probability that the green
event happens?",00:04:09.350,00:04:13.710
"You can guess the answer,
that it should be 1/3.",00:04:13.710,00:04:16.579
Why is that?,00:04:16.579,00:04:17.870
"Each one of these blue
outcomes has the same",00:04:17.870,00:04:22.420
probability.,00:04:22.420,00:04:23.440
"So when you condition on the
blue outcome having happened,",00:04:23.440,00:04:27.250
"the conditional probability
of each one of",00:04:27.250,00:04:29.710
these should be 1/3.,00:04:29.710,00:04:31.810
"So given that the blue outcome
happened, there's probability",00:04:31.810,00:04:35.100
"1/3 that this particular
one has happened.",00:04:35.100,00:04:40.010
"And this is the only one that
makes the green event happen.",00:04:40.010,00:04:43.450
"But let us see if we
can derive this",00:04:43.450,00:04:45.550
answer in a formal manner.,00:04:45.550,00:04:47.330
"Let's see if we're
going to get 1/3.",00:04:47.330,00:04:49.740
"We use the definition of
conditional probabilities.",00:04:49.740,00:04:52.520
"The conditional probability is
the ratio, first, of the",00:04:52.520,00:04:56.360
"probability that both events
happen, divided by the",00:04:56.360,00:05:03.920
"probability of the conditioning
event, which is",00:05:03.920,00:05:07.610
the probability of 1 head.,00:05:07.610,00:05:09.486
"Now, the probability of
both events happening.",00:05:14.620,00:05:18.620
"That we have exactly one head
and the first toss is heads.",00:05:18.620,00:05:22.910
"This is the intersection of the
blue event and the green",00:05:22.910,00:05:25.950
"event which can happen only in
this particular outcome,",00:05:25.950,00:05:29.150
"namely the sequence heads,
tails, tails.",00:05:29.150,00:05:32.360
"And has probability p times
(1 minus p) squared.",00:05:32.360,00:05:37.230
"The denominator is something
that we have already",00:05:37.230,00:05:39.840
calculated.,00:05:39.840,00:05:40.680
"It's 3p times (1 minus
p) squared.",00:05:40.680,00:05:43.930
"And so the final answer is
1/3 as we had guessed.",00:05:43.930,00:05:47.855
"Let me now make a few comments
about this particular example.",00:05:51.030,00:05:56.100
"This particular example is
pretty special in the",00:05:56.100,00:05:59.310
following respect.,00:05:59.310,00:06:01.400
"We have that of the probability
of H2, heads in",00:06:01.400,00:06:06.375
"the second toss, given that the
first one was heads, is",00:06:06.375,00:06:09.610
equal to p.,00:06:09.610,00:06:11.190
"And the same is true for the
conditional probability of",00:06:11.190,00:06:15.100
"heads in the second toss given
that the first one was tails.",00:06:15.100,00:06:22.390
"In other words, our beliefs
about what may happen in the",00:06:22.390,00:06:26.540
second toss remain the same.,00:06:26.540,00:06:29.130
"There's a probability, p, of
obtaining heads no matter what",00:06:29.130,00:06:33.690
happened in the first toss.,00:06:33.690,00:06:35.900
"Telling you the result of the
first toss doesn't change your",00:06:35.900,00:06:38.880
"beliefs about what may happen,
and with what probability, in",00:06:38.880,00:06:43.450
the second toss.,00:06:43.450,00:06:44.930
"And if you were to calculate the
unconditional probability",00:06:44.930,00:06:48.470
"of heads in the second toss,
what you would get using the",00:06:48.470,00:06:54.310
"total probability theorem
would be the following.",00:06:54.310,00:06:57.370
"It's probability of heads in
the first toss times the",00:06:57.370,00:07:00.450
"probability of heads in the
second, given heads in the",00:07:00.450,00:07:04.330
"first, plus the probability of
tails in the first toss times",00:07:04.330,00:07:10.710
"the probability of heads in the
second toss, given tails",00:07:10.710,00:07:14.900
in the first.,00:07:14.900,00:07:16.320
"And if you do the algebra,
this turns out to",00:07:16.320,00:07:19.910
be equal to p again.,00:07:19.910,00:07:23.560
"So the unconditional probability
of heads in the",00:07:23.560,00:07:26.660
"second toss turns out to be the
same as the conditional",00:07:26.660,00:07:30.180
probabilities.,00:07:30.180,00:07:31.500
"Again, knowing what happened
in the first toss doesn't",00:07:31.500,00:07:35.000
"change your beliefs about the
second toss, which were",00:07:35.000,00:07:38.780
"associated with this particular
probability, p.",00:07:38.780,00:07:41.890
"So what we're going to do next
is to generalize this special",00:07:41.890,00:07:46.490
"situation by giving a definition
of independence of",00:07:46.490,00:07:50.190
"events, and then discuss
various properties and",00:07:50.190,00:07:54.920
"concepts associated
with independence.",00:07:54.920,00:07:56.610
