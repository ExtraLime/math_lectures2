"So this is CS50 and this
is the end of week 10.",00:00:11.661,00:00:15.400
"So some of you might have seen this
already, but being circulated of late",00:00:15.400,00:00:20.420
"is an article that I thought I'd read
an excerpt from and then show you a",00:00:20.420,00:00:25.800
"three minute video that paints
the same picture.",00:00:25.800,00:00:27.800
"It was really a touching story, I
thought, of this intersection of the",00:00:27.800,00:00:30.950
"real world with genuinely compelling
uses of technology.",00:00:30.950,00:00:35.210
"&gt;&gt; So the article was entitled, ""A boy
oversleeps on train, uses Google Maps",00:00:35.210,00:00:39.785
"to find family 25 years later."" And the
first couple of paragraphs were,",00:00:39.785,00:00:44.930
"""When Saroo was five years old he went
with his older brother to scrounge for",00:00:44.930,00:00:48.820

"Saroo became tired and hopped on a
nearby train where he thought his",00:00:53.510,00:00:56.790

nearly 900 miles away.",00:00:58.880,00:01:03.360
"Saroo tried to find his way
back, but he didn't know",00:01:03.360,00:01:05.770
the name of his hometown.,00:01:05.770,00:01:07.260
"And as a tiny illiterate boy in a vast
city full of forgotten children he had",00:01:07.260,00:01:11.430
virtually no chance of getting home.,00:01:11.430,00:01:13.520
"&gt;&gt; He was a street child for a while until
a local adoption agency hooked",00:01:13.520,00:01:16.760
"him up with an Australian couple
who brought him to",00:01:16.760,00:01:18.840
"live in Hobart, Tasmania.",00:01:18.840,00:01:20.600
"Saroo moved there, learned
English, and grew up.",00:01:20.600,00:01:23.130
"But he never stopped looking for
his family and his hometown.",00:01:23.130,00:01:27.450
"&gt;&gt; Decades later, he discovered Google
Earth and followed rail tracks.",00:01:27.450,00:01:32.380
"And giving himself a prescribed radius
based on how long he thought he was",00:01:32.380,00:01:36.140
"asleep and how fast he thought the train
was going, he knew he'd grown up",00:01:36.140,00:01:40.020
"in a warm climate, he knew he spoke
Hindi as a child, and he'd been told",00:01:40.020,00:01:43.930
"that he looked like he
was from East India.",00:01:43.930,00:01:46.160
"&gt;&gt; Finally, after years of scouring
the satellite photos, he",00:01:46.160,00:01:49.650
recognized a few landmarks.,00:01:49.650,00:01:51.340

of a nearby town's",00:01:51.340,00:01:54.180

he'd found home.""",00:01:54.180,00:01:57.740

just about to turn five.",00:02:04.025,00:02:07.480
"We got to the train station and
we boarded a train together.",00:02:07.480,00:02:10.539
"My brother just said I'll stay
here and I'll come back.",00:02:10.539,00:02:13.390
"And I just thought, well, you know, I
might as well just go to sleep and",00:02:13.390,00:02:16.363
then he'll just wake me up.,00:02:16.363,00:02:17.950
"And when I wake up the next day, the
whole carriage was empty on a runaway",00:02:17.950,00:02:21.740
"train, a ghost train taking
me I don't know where.",00:02:21.740,00:02:24.305
"&gt;&gt; I was adopted out to Australia
to a Australian family.",00:02:27.120,00:02:31.660
"And Mom had decorated my room with
the map of India, which she",00:02:31.660,00:02:35.360
put next to my bedside.,00:02:35.360,00:02:37.090
"I woke up every morning seeing that map,
and hence, it sort of kept the",00:02:37.090,00:02:42.170
memories alive.,00:02:42.170,00:02:43.740
"&gt;&gt; People would say, you're trying to
find a needle in a haystack.",00:02:43.740,00:02:46.475
"Saroo, you'll never find it.",00:02:46.475,00:02:49.060
"I'd have flashes of the places that
I used to go, the flashes",00:02:49.060,00:02:52.510
of my family's faces.,00:02:52.510,00:02:55.050
"There was the image of my mother sitting
down with her legs crossed",00:02:55.050,00:02:59.200
just watching her cry.,00:02:59.200,00:03:00.610
Life is just so hard.,00:03:00.610,00:03:03.340
That was my treasure.,00:03:03.340,00:03:06.002
"&gt;&gt; And I was looking in Google Map and
realized there's Google Earth as well.",00:03:06.002,00:03:09.390
"In a world where you could zoom into I
started to have all these thoughts and",00:03:09.390,00:03:13.560
"what possibilities that
this could do for me.",00:03:13.560,00:03:16.650
"I said to myself, well, you know,
you've got all the photographic",00:03:16.650,00:03:19.520
"memories and landmarks where you're
from and you know what",00:03:19.520,00:03:22.340
the town looks like.,00:03:22.340,00:03:23.460
"This could be an application that you
can use to find your way back.",00:03:23.460,00:03:27.910
"&gt;&gt; I thought, well, I'll put a dot on
Calcutta Train Station in a radius",00:03:27.910,00:03:32.750
"line that you should be searching
around this area.",00:03:32.750,00:03:36.350
I came across these train tracks.,00:03:36.350,00:03:38.850
"And I started following it and I came to
a train station which reflected the",00:03:38.850,00:03:44.490
same image that was in my memories.,00:03:44.490,00:03:48.260
&gt;&gt; Everything matched.,00:03:48.260,00:03:49.730
"I just thought, yep.",00:03:49.730,00:03:50.800
I know where I'm going.,00:03:50.800,00:03:51.545
"I'm just going to let the map that I
have in my head to lead me and take me",00:03:51.545,00:03:55.387
back to my hometown.,00:03:55.387,00:03:58.230
"&gt;&gt; I came to the doorstep of the house
that I was born and walked around",00:03:58.230,00:04:02.290
"about fifteen meters
around the corner.",00:04:02.290,00:04:04.270
"There was three ladies standing outside
adjacent to each other.",00:04:04.270,00:04:08.140
And the middle one stepped forward.,00:04:08.140,00:04:10.230
"And I just thought, this
is your mother.",00:04:10.230,00:04:12.910
"She came forward, she hugged me, and we
were there for about five minutes.",00:04:12.910,00:04:18.590
"&gt;&gt; She grabbed my hand and she took me to
the house and got on the phone and she",00:04:21.670,00:04:25.787
"rang my sister and my brother to say
that your brother has just all of the",00:04:25.787,00:04:31.110
sudden appeared like a ghost.,00:04:31.110,00:04:34.480
"&gt;&gt; And then the family was
reunited again.",00:04:34.480,00:04:37.590
Everything's all good.,00:04:37.590,00:04:38.570
I help my mother out.,00:04:38.570,00:04:40.250
She doesn't have to be slaving away.,00:04:40.250,00:04:42.240
"She can lead the rest of
her life in peace.",00:04:42.240,00:04:45.040
"&gt;&gt; It was a needle in a haystack,
but the needle was there.",00:04:45.040,00:04:48.590
Everything's there.,00:04:48.590,00:04:49.530
"Everything we have in the world
is the tap of a button.",00:04:49.530,00:04:53.410
"But you've got to have the will and
the determination to wanting it.",00:04:53.410,00:04:57.375
&gt;&gt; [END VIDEO PLAYBACK],00:05:02.310,00:05:02.780
&gt;&gt; So a really sweet story.,00:05:02.780,00:05:04.220
"And it actually reminds me of quite a
topic that's been getting quite a bit",00:05:04.220,00:05:08.430
"of attention of late in The Crimson,
more nationally in general.",00:05:08.430,00:05:11.200
"Especially as MOOCs are taking
the stage of late.",00:05:11.200,00:05:13.620
"MOOCs being these massive and open
online courses of which CS50 is one.",00:05:13.620,00:05:17.370
"&gt;&gt; And people talking about how, for
instance, the humanities aren't really",00:05:17.370,00:05:20.680
"catching up or aren't nearly as
in vogue as they once were.",00:05:20.680,00:05:23.900
"And I would encourage you guys, much
like Jonathan did on Monday, to think",00:05:23.900,00:05:26.680
"about as you exit 50, and we know
already about 50% of you will not",00:05:26.680,00:05:29.900
"continue on to take another computer
science course, and that's totally",00:05:29.900,00:05:32.480
fine and expected.,00:05:32.480,00:05:33.770
"Because one of the overarching goals
of a class like this is really to",00:05:33.770,00:05:36.620
"empower you guys with just an
understanding of how all of this stuff",00:05:36.620,00:05:39.790
"works and how this world
of technology works.",00:05:39.790,00:05:41.760
"&gt;&gt; So that when you are back in your own
worlds, whether it's pre-med or",00:05:41.760,00:05:45.400
"whether it's the humanities or the
social sciences or some other field",00:05:45.400,00:05:48.270
"altogether, that you guys are bringing
some technical savvy to the table and",00:05:48.270,00:05:51.830
"helping to make smart decisions when
it comes to the use of and",00:05:51.830,00:05:54.770
"introduction of technology
into your world.",00:05:54.770,00:05:57.530
"&gt;&gt; For instance I was reminded of late
too of two of the undergraduate",00:05:57.530,00:06:00.410
"classes I took two years ago, which were
such simple uses of technology",00:06:00.410,00:06:04.410
but ever so compelling.,00:06:04.410,00:06:06.180
"First Nights with Professor Tom Kelly
if you've taken the class.",00:06:06.180,00:06:08.845
"It's a class on classical music on
this stage here where you learn a",00:06:08.845,00:06:11.640
little something about music.,00:06:11.640,00:06:13.190
"It's actually First Nights that CS50
borrowed the idea of tracks for those",00:06:13.190,00:06:17.770
"less comfortable in between
and more comfortable.",00:06:17.770,00:06:20.630
"&gt;&gt; In my time they had different tracks
for kids with absolutely no music",00:06:20.630,00:06:24.410
"experience like me, and then kids who
had been performing since they were",00:06:24.410,00:06:27.300
five years old.,00:06:27.300,00:06:28.240
"And that class, for instance, just had
a website like most any other, but it",00:06:28.240,00:06:31.200
"was a website that allowed you to
explore music on it and play back",00:06:31.200,00:06:34.210
"musical clips from class, from the web,
and just use technology in a very",00:06:34.210,00:06:39.120
seamless way.,00:06:39.120,00:06:40.210
"&gt;&gt; Another class years later that I
audited, essentially, in grad school,",00:06:40.210,00:06:44.460
"Anthro 1010, Introduction
to Archaeology here.",00:06:44.460,00:06:47.430
It was amazing.,00:06:47.430,00:06:48.190
"And one of the most compelling yet super
obvious, in retrospect, uses of",00:06:48.190,00:06:52.715
"software was that the professors in
that class used Google Earth.",00:06:52.715,00:06:56.000
"We were sitting across the street
in some lecture hall.",00:06:56.000,00:06:58.250
"And you couldn't travel, for instance,
to the Middle East to the dig that one",00:06:58.250,00:07:01.240
"of the professors had just come back on,
but we could do that virtually by",00:07:01.240,00:07:04.530
"flying around in Google Earth and
looking at a bird's eye view at the",00:07:04.530,00:07:07.870
"dig site he had just returned
from a week ago.",00:07:07.870,00:07:10.360
"&gt;&gt; So I would encourage you guys,
especially in the humanities, to go",00:07:10.360,00:07:12.630
"back to those departments after this
class bringing your final projects",00:07:12.630,00:07:16.260
"with you or ideas of your own, and see
just what you can do to infuse your",00:07:16.260,00:07:19.960
"own fields in humanities or beyond
with a little bit of this sort of",00:07:19.960,00:07:23.570
"thing that we've explored
here in CS50.",00:07:23.570,00:07:26.770
"&gt;&gt; So with that picture painted, thought
we'd try to tackle two things today.",00:07:26.770,00:07:31.790
"One, try to give you a sense of
where you can go after 50.",00:07:31.790,00:07:35.040
"And in particular, if you choose to
tackle a web based project as is",00:07:35.040,00:07:37.950
"incredibly common, how you can go
about taking off all of CS50's",00:07:37.950,00:07:42.580
"training wheels and going out there on
your own and not having to rely on a",00:07:42.580,00:07:45.810
PDF or a specification of a pset?,00:07:45.810,00:07:48.000
"Not having to rely on a CS50
appliance anymore.",00:07:48.000,00:07:50.510
"But can really pull yourself
up by your bootstraps.",00:07:50.510,00:07:52.780
"&gt;&gt; With that said, C-based final
projects are welcome.",00:07:52.780,00:07:55.790
"Things that use the stand for
a portable library in",00:07:55.790,00:07:58.020
graphics are welcome.,00:07:58.020,00:07:59.510
"We just know that statistically a lot of
people bite off projects in PHP and",00:07:59.510,00:08:03.240
"Python and Ruby and MySQL and other
environments, so we'll bias some of",00:08:03.240,00:08:07.860
our remarks toward that.,00:08:07.860,00:08:09.570
&gt;&gt; But a quick look back.,00:08:09.570,00:08:10.650
"So we took for granted in pset7 the
fact that $_SESSION existed.",00:08:10.650,00:08:15.940
"This was a super global, a global,
associative array.",00:08:15.940,00:08:19.400
And what does this let you do?,00:08:19.400,00:08:23.040
"Functionally, what's the
feature this gives us?",00:08:23.040,00:08:27.130
Yeah?,00:08:27.130,00:08:28.590
To track the user's ID.,00:08:28.590,00:08:30.270
And why is this useful?,00:08:30.270,00:08:31.660
"To be able to store inside of this super
global JHarvard or [? Scroobs ?]",00:08:31.660,00:08:36.059
"or Malan's user ID when he
or she visits a site.",00:08:36.059,00:08:41.880
&gt;&gt; Exactly.,00:08:41.880,00:08:42.380
"So you don't have to log
in again and again.",00:08:42.380,00:08:44.049
"It would be a really lame world wide web
if every time you clicked a link",00:08:44.049,00:08:47.170
"on a site like Facebook or every time
you clicked on an email in Gmail you",00:08:47.170,00:08:50.780
"had to re-authenticate to prove that
it's still you and not your roommate",00:08:50.780,00:08:54.060
"who might have walked up to your
computer in your absence.",00:08:54.060,00:08:56.700
"&gt;&gt; So we use SESSION to just
remember who you are.",00:08:56.700,00:08:59.640
"And how is this implemented
underneath the hood?",00:08:59.640,00:09:01.830
"How does a website that uses , the
protocol that web browsers and servers",00:09:01.830,00:09:07.720
"speak, how does HTTP, which is a
stateless protocol, let's say.",00:09:07.720,00:09:12.060
"&gt;&gt; And by stateless I mean, once you
connect to a website, download some",00:09:12.060,00:09:15.510
"HTMLs, some JavaScript, some CSS, your
browser's icon stops spinning.",00:09:15.510,00:09:19.650
"You don't have a constant connection
to the server typically.",00:09:19.650,00:09:23.420
That's it.,00:09:23.420,00:09:24.170
"There's no state maintained
constantly.",00:09:24.170,00:09:26.290
"So how is SESSION implemented in such
a way that every time you do visit a",00:09:26.290,00:09:30.510
"new page, the website remembers
who you are?",00:09:30.510,00:09:32.860
"What's the underlying implementation
detail?",00:09:36.150,00:09:38.195
Shout it out.,00:09:40.810,00:09:41.490
It's one word.,00:09:41.490,00:09:43.270
&gt;&gt; Cookies.,00:09:43.270,00:09:43.640
All right.,00:09:43.640,00:09:44.190
So cookies.,00:09:44.190,00:09:44.800
"Well, how are cookies used?",00:09:44.800,00:09:45.900
"We'll recall that a cookie is generally
just a piece of information.",00:09:45.900,00:09:48.870
"And it's often a big random
number, but not always.",00:09:48.870,00:09:51.590
"And a cookie is planted on your hard
drive or in your computer's RAM so",00:09:51.590,00:09:55.420
"that every time you revisit that same

that user 1234567 is",00:10:03.570,00:10:07.590
"JHarvard, the website will just assume
that you are who you say you are.",00:10:07.590,00:10:11.300

sort of in the form of a",00:10:11.300,00:10:14.230
virtual hand stand.,00:10:14.230,00:10:15.510
"It's sent in the HTTP headers just to
remind the server that you are who it",00:10:15.510,00:10:20.530
thinks you are.,00:10:20.530,00:10:21.620
"&gt;&gt; Of course, there's a threat.",00:10:21.620,00:10:23.320
"What threat does this open us up to if
we're essentially using sort of a club",00:10:23.320,00:10:27.530
"or an amusement park mechanism
for remembering who we are?",00:10:27.530,00:10:30.110
"&gt;&gt; If you copy someone's cookie and hijack
their session, so to speak, you",00:10:32.630,00:10:36.170
"can pretend to be someone else and the
website most likely is just going to",00:10:36.170,00:10:39.670
believe you.,00:10:39.670,00:10:40.150
So we'll come back to that.,00:10:40.150,00:10:41.030
"Because the other theme for today beyond
empowerment is also talking",00:10:41.030,00:10:44.240
"about the very scary world we live in
and just how much of what you do on",00:10:44.240,00:10:48.170

on your cell phones today can be",00:10:48.170,00:10:51.480
"tracked really by anyone between
you and point B.",00:10:51.480,00:10:55.170
"&gt;&gt; And Ajax, recall.",00:10:55.170,00:10:56.240
"We looked only briefly at this,
although you've been using it",00:10:56.240,00:10:58.740
"indirectly in pset8 because you're using
Google Maps and because you're",00:10:58.740,00:11:02.660
using Google Earth.,00:11:02.660,00:11:03.830
"Google Maps and Google Earth don't
download the entire world to your",00:11:03.830,00:11:07.780
"desktop, obviously, the
moment you load pset8.",00:11:07.780,00:11:10.490
"It only downloads a square of the world
or a bigger square of the earth.",00:11:10.490,00:11:15.020
"And then every time you sort of steer
out of range you might notice--",00:11:15.020,00:11:18.910
"especially if on a slow connection-- you
might see some gray for a moment",00:11:18.910,00:11:21.790
"or a bit of fuzzy imagery as the
computer downloads more such tiles,",00:11:21.790,00:11:26.440
"more such imagery from the
world or the earth.",00:11:26.440,00:11:29.190
"&gt;&gt; And Ajax is generally the technique
by which websites are doing that.",00:11:29.190,00:11:34.620
"Once you need more of the map, your
browser is going to use Ajax, which is",00:11:34.620,00:11:39.250
"not itself a language or technology,
it's just a technique.",00:11:39.250,00:11:42.240
"It's the use of JavaScript to go get
more information from a server that",00:11:42.240,00:11:47.390
"allows your browser to go get what's to
the east or what's to the west of",00:11:47.390,00:11:52.320
"what's otherwise currently
being shown in that map.",00:11:52.320,00:11:55.110
"So this is a topic that many of you
will encounter either directly or",00:11:55.110,00:11:58.520
"indirectly via final projects if you
choose to make something that's",00:11:58.520,00:12:01.180

to save folks some stress.",00:12:25.230,00:12:29.210
"For the most part a lot of the chatter
we see at office hours and a lot of",00:12:29.210,00:12:32.530
"the bugs we see reported on Discuss are
indeed bugs in a student's code.",00:12:32.530,00:12:36.950
"But when you've encountered something
like the Google Earth plug-in crashing",00:12:36.950,00:12:41.360
"or not even working and you are
confident it's not you, it's not a",00:12:41.360,00:12:44.310
"[? chamad ?] issue, it is not a
bug you introduced into the",00:12:44.310,00:12:48.530
distribution code.,00:12:48.530,00:12:49.820
&gt;&gt; Realize just FYI--,00:12:49.820,00:12:51.250
this is sort of plan Z--,00:12:51.250,00:12:53.130
"that the last time we used this problem
set and we ran into similar",00:12:53.130,00:12:57.100
"issues, there's a line of code in
service.js that essentially is this,",00:12:57.100,00:13:01.520
"that says, turn buildings on.",00:13:01.520,00:13:03.580
"And they work around the last time we
did this in, again, corner cases where",00:13:03.580,00:13:07.100
"students just couldn't get the darn
thing to work is change true to false",00:13:07.100,00:13:11.660
in that one line of code.,00:13:11.660,00:13:12.940
"And you'll find it if you search
through service.js.",00:13:12.940,00:13:15.520
"&gt;&gt; I don't recommend this because you will
create the most barren landscape",00:13:15.520,00:13:19.990
"of Cambridge, Massachusetts.",00:13:19.990,00:13:21.720
"This will literally flatten your world
so that all you see are the teaching",00:13:21.720,00:13:24.930
"fellows and course assistants on
the horizon and no buildings.",00:13:24.930,00:13:28.610
"But realize for whatever reason the
Google Earth plug-in seems still to be",00:13:28.610,00:13:31.980
"buggy a year later, so this
might be your fail save.",00:13:31.980,00:13:35.290
"So rather than resort to tears, resort
to turning buildings off if you know",00:13:35.290,00:13:38.915
"it's the plug-in that's not cooperating
on your Mac or PC.",00:13:38.915,00:13:41.980
"But, this is again last resort if
you're sure it's not a bug.",00:13:41.980,00:13:46.060
&gt;&gt; So the Hackathon.,00:13:46.060,00:13:46.890
"A couple of teasers just
to get you excited.",00:13:46.890,00:13:48.950
We had quite a few RSVPs.,00:13:48.950,00:13:50.640
"And just to paint a picture of what
awaits, I thought I'd give you a few",00:13:50.640,00:13:54.230
"seconds recall of this imagery
from last year.",00:13:54.230,00:13:56.858
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC],00:13:56.858,00:14:00.850
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Wait, oh.",00:14:00.850,00:14:02.240
We even have our literal CS50 shuttles.,00:14:02.240,00:14:05.410
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC],00:14:05.410,00:14:17.920
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: So that's what awaits
you in terms of the Hackathon.",00:14:17.920,00:14:20.620
"And this will be an opportunity, to
be clear, not to start your final",00:14:20.620,00:14:24.180
"projects but to continue working on
your final projects alongside",00:14:24.180,00:14:27.730
classmates and staff and lots of food.,00:14:27.730,00:14:30.210
"And again, if you're awake at 5:00 AM
we'll take you down the road to IHOP.",00:14:30.210,00:14:34.340
"&gt;&gt; The CS50 fair, meanwhile, is the climax
for the entire class where",00:14:34.340,00:14:37.075
"you'll bring your laptops and friends,
maybe even family to a room on campus",00:14:37.075,00:14:41.160
"down the street to exhibit your projects
on laptops, on tall tables",00:14:41.160,00:14:44.530
"like this with lots of food and friends
and music in the background,",00:14:44.530,00:14:47.570
as well as our friends from industry.,00:14:47.570,00:14:49.250
"Companies like Facebook and Microsoft
and Google and Amazon and bunches of",00:14:49.250,00:14:52.760
"others so that if interested in just
hearing about the real world or",00:14:52.760,00:14:55.750
"chatting with folks about real world
internship or full time opportunities,",00:14:55.750,00:14:59.570
"know that some of our friends
from industry will be there.",00:14:59.570,00:15:01.950
"And a couple of pictures we can
paint here are as follows.",00:15:01.950,00:15:04.970
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC],00:15:04.970,00:15:24.400
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: All right.,00:15:24.400,00:15:24.920
So that then is the CS50 fair.,00:15:24.920,00:15:27.060
"So let's now proceed to tell a story
that really will empower you hopefully",00:15:27.060,00:15:31.780
for things like final projects.,00:15:31.780,00:15:33.230
"So one of few little things to seed your
mind, either for final projects",00:15:33.230,00:15:36.940
"or just more generally for projects that
you might decide to tackle after",00:15:36.940,00:15:40.470
"the course, these are all documented
on manual.cs50.net where the CS50",00:15:40.470,00:15:45.720
"manual where we have lots of
techniques documented.",00:15:45.720,00:15:48.010
"&gt;&gt; And this is just shorthand notation for
saying that there exists in the",00:15:48.010,00:15:51.080
"world things called SMS to email
gateways, which is a fancy way of",00:15:51.080,00:15:55.190
"saying, there's servers in the world
that know how to convert emails to",00:15:55.190,00:15:58.180
text messages.,00:15:58.180,00:15:59.230
"So if for your final project you want
to create some sort of mobile themed",00:15:59.230,00:16:02.450
"service that allows you to alert friends
or users to events on campus",00:16:02.450,00:16:06.650
"or what's being served in the D Hall
that night or any such alert feature,",00:16:06.650,00:16:10.290
"know that it's simple as sending an
email as with PHPMailer which you",00:16:10.290,00:16:15.150
"might have used for pset7 or we saw
briefly a week or so ago, to",00:16:15.150,00:16:18.735
addresses like this.,00:16:18.735,00:16:20.440
"&gt;&gt; And in fact you can text this assuming
your friend has an unlimited texting",00:16:20.440,00:16:26.040
"plan and you don't want
to charge them $0.10.",00:16:26.040,00:16:28.310
"But if you send an email to your friend
who you know to have Verizon or",00:16:28.310,00:16:31.920
"AT&amp;T using Gmail and just sending it to
their phone number at whatever the",00:16:31.920,00:16:35.870
"sub domain there is, realize you
will send a text message.",00:16:35.870,00:16:38.980
"&gt;&gt; But this is one of those things
to be careful of.",00:16:38.980,00:16:41.570
"If you troll through last year's CS50
videos I think it was, a horrific,",00:16:41.570,00:16:47.430
"horrific, horrific bug I wrote in code
ended up sending about 20,000 text",00:16:47.430,00:16:51.660
"messages live to our
students in class.",00:16:51.660,00:16:55.410
"And only because someone noticed that
they were getting multiple text",00:16:55.410,00:16:57.970
"messages from me did I have the
wherewithal to hit Control C quickly",00:16:57.970,00:17:01.860
and stop that process.,00:17:01.860,00:17:03.210
"Control C, you recall, is your friend
in instances of infinite loop.",00:17:03.210,00:17:06.200
"So beware the power we have just given
to you rather irresponsibly, most",00:17:06.200,00:17:10.900
"likely, based on my own experience.",00:17:10.900,00:17:12.950
"But that's on the web and has
been there for some time.",00:17:12.950,00:17:15.400
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:17:15.400,00:17:15.810
So textmarks.com.,00:17:15.810,00:17:17.064
So this is a website.,00:17:17.064,00:17:18.040
"And there's bunches of others out there
as well that we've actually used",00:17:18.040,00:17:20.829
"as a class for years to be able
to receive text messages.",00:17:20.829,00:17:24.050
"Unfortunately, sending text messages is
easy as sending emails like that.",00:17:24.050,00:17:27.869
"Receiving's a little harder, especially
if you want to have one of",00:17:27.869,00:17:30.730
"those sexy short codes that's only
five or six digits long.",00:17:30.730,00:17:34.610
"&gt;&gt; So for instance, for years you've been
able to send a text message-- and you",00:17:34.610,00:17:37.720
can try this as well--,00:17:37.720,00:17:39.200
to 41411.,00:17:39.200,00:17:41.900
"And that's the phone number for
this particular startup.",00:17:41.900,00:17:44.300
And if you send a message to 41411--,00:17:44.300,00:17:48.130
"I'll just write it up here, so 41411--",00:17:48.130,00:17:51.190
"and then send them a message
like SBOY for Shuttle Boy.",00:17:51.190,00:17:54.290
"And then type in something
like mather quad.",00:17:54.290,00:17:56.370
"So you send that text message
to that phone number.",00:17:56.370,00:17:59.360
"Within a few seconds you should get back
a response from the CS50 Shuttle",00:17:59.360,00:18:02.630
"Boy service, which is the shuttle
scheduling software that we've had out",00:18:02.630,00:18:06.210
there on the web for some time.,00:18:06.210,00:18:07.290
"And it will respond to
you via text message.",00:18:07.290,00:18:09.450
"&gt;&gt; Because what we have done as a class, as
a programmer, is to write software,",00:18:09.450,00:18:13.410
"configured our free account with text
marks to listen for text messages sent",00:18:13.410,00:18:18.760
to SBOY at that number.,00:18:18.760,00:18:20.770
"And what they do is forward those text
messages to our PHP-based website as",00:18:20.770,00:18:25.210
"HTTP parameters saying, here.",00:18:25.210,00:18:27.420
"This user with this phone number
sent you this text message.",00:18:27.420,00:18:30.380
Do with it what you want.,00:18:30.380,00:18:31.850
"&gt;&gt; So we wrote some software that upon
receiving a string like SBOY mather",00:18:31.850,00:18:35.180
"quad, we parse it.",00:18:35.180,00:18:38.420
"We figure out where the spaces
are between words.",00:18:38.420,00:18:41.210
"And we as a class decide
how to respond to that.",00:18:41.210,00:18:44.220
"And if you try that now, for instance,
you should see, via response within a",00:18:44.220,00:18:47.335
"few seconds, the next few shuttles going
from mather to the quad if any.",00:18:47.335,00:18:51.470
And there's other stops.,00:18:51.470,00:18:52.260
"You can type in Boylston or other such
stops on campus, and it should",00:18:52.260,00:18:56.060
recognize those words.,00:18:56.060,00:18:57.760
&gt;&gt; So parse.com.,00:18:57.760,00:18:58.590
"This is another service that we've been
pointing some students at for",00:18:58.590,00:19:01.630
"final projects that's wonderful
in that it's free for a",00:19:01.630,00:19:04.390
reasonable amount of usage.,00:19:04.390,00:19:05.660
"And if I go to parse.com you'll see
that this is an alternative to",00:19:05.660,00:19:08.820
"actually having something like
your own MySQL database.",00:19:08.820,00:19:13.230
"And frankly, it's just
kind of mesmerizing.",00:19:13.230,00:19:14.490
"This is what's inside of the
cloud even on a cloudy day.",00:19:14.490,00:19:17.450
"&gt;&gt; So parse.com allows you to do a
bunch of interesting things.",00:19:17.450,00:19:21.580
"And there's other alternatives
to this out there.",00:19:21.580,00:19:23.610
"For instance, you can use them
as your back end database.",00:19:23.610,00:19:26.870
"So you don't need to have
a web hosting company.",00:19:26.870,00:19:28.980
"You don't need to have
a MySQL database.",00:19:28.980,00:19:31.180
You can instead use their back end.,00:19:31.180,00:19:32.850
"&gt;&gt; If you're doing a mobile project for
Android or iOS or the like, know that",00:19:32.850,00:19:36.350
"there exists things like push services
so you can push alerts to your friends",00:19:36.350,00:19:39.776
or your users' home screens.,00:19:39.776,00:19:41.390
"And then a bunch of other
features as well.",00:19:41.390,00:19:43.600
"&gt;&gt; So if you have interest, check out these
websites and websites like them",00:19:43.600,00:19:47.200
"to just see how many other peoples'
shoulders you can stand on to make",00:19:47.200,00:19:50.720
really cool software of your own.,00:19:50.720,00:19:53.350
"&gt;&gt; Now in terms of authentication, an FAQ,
is how do you actually guarantee",00:19:53.350,00:19:56.690
"that your users are people on campus,
Harvard students or faculty or staff?",00:19:56.690,00:20:01.220
"So CS50 has its own authentication
service called CS50 ID.",00:20:01.220,00:20:05.350
"Go to that URL and you can restrict your
website to anyone with a Harvard",00:20:05.350,00:20:09.940
"ID, for instance.",00:20:09.940,00:20:11.340
So know that we can handle that.,00:20:11.340,00:20:12.550
"You guys should not be in the business
of saying, what's your Harvard ID?",00:20:12.550,00:20:15.280
What's your Harvard PIN?,00:20:15.280,00:20:16.160
Let me now do something with it.,00:20:16.160,00:20:17.550
We'll do all of that.,00:20:17.550,00:20:18.740
"And what we'll give you back is
someone's name and email address, but",00:20:18.740,00:20:21.710
not anything sensitive.,00:20:21.710,00:20:23.010
"&gt;&gt; An app on a mobile device, it can be
made to work on a mobile device, but",00:20:26.240,00:20:30.380
it's not quite designed for that.,00:20:30.380,00:20:32.630
"So you'll end up spending a non trivial
amount of time doing so.",00:20:32.630,00:20:35.640
"So I would discourage
that route for now.",00:20:35.640,00:20:38.040
"This is really intended for
web based applications.",00:20:38.040,00:20:41.570
&gt;&gt; So web hosting.,00:20:41.570,00:20:42.650
"So if you haven't seen on
the course's homepage--",00:20:42.650,00:20:44.450
and here's where we'll begin a story--,00:20:44.450,00:20:46.610
"web hosting is all about paying for
usually a service, host a server owned",00:20:46.610,00:20:50.900
"by someone else on the web that has an
IP address, and you then put your",00:20:50.900,00:20:54.800
website on it.,00:20:54.800,00:20:55.880
"And they usually give you email
accounts and databases",00:20:55.880,00:20:58.620
and other such features.,00:20:58.620,00:21:00.160
"&gt;&gt; Know that if you don't want to actually
pay for such, go to that URL",00:21:00.160,00:21:02.930
"there and CS50 actually has a non-profit
account that you can use to",00:21:02.930,00:21:06.280
"actually have not http://project
inside of the appliance",00:21:06.280,00:21:11.490
for your final project.,00:21:11.490,00:21:12.470
"If you actually want it to be something
like, isawyouharvard.com,",00:21:12.470,00:21:16.465
"you can buy that domain name-- although
not that particular one-- and",00:21:16.465,00:21:19.730
"then you can go about hosting it on a
public web server like we can offer",00:21:19.730,00:21:24.070
you guys through here.,00:21:24.070,00:21:25.170
"&gt;&gt; And in fact if unfamiliar,
if you've never been to",00:21:25.170,00:21:27.240
"isawyouharvard.com, one, go there.",00:21:27.240,00:21:30.590
"But two, know that that was a young
woman's name by Tej To Toor Too two",00:21:30.590,00:21:37.310
"years ago, three years ago, who was a
CS50 alumni who happened a day or two",00:21:37.310,00:21:41.550
"before the CS50 fair sent out an email
to her house mailing list and voila.",00:21:41.550,00:21:46.280
"Two days later by the CS50 fair, she had
hundreds of users all creeping on",00:21:46.280,00:21:49.770
"each other on her website and
saying how they had seen",00:21:49.770,00:21:53.240
her or him on campus.,00:21:53.240,00:21:55.250
"So that's one of CS50's favorite
success stories from",00:21:55.250,00:21:57.600
a CS50 final project.,00:21:57.600,00:21:59.650
"&gt;&gt; So how do you go about putting a website
like that on the internet?",00:21:59.650,00:22:04.090
"Well, there's a few such
ingredients here.",00:22:04.090,00:22:07.140
"So one, you have to buy a domain name.",00:22:07.140,00:22:09.310
"There are bunches of places in
the world from which you can",00:22:09.310,00:22:12.440
buy a domain name.,00:22:12.440,00:22:13.940
"And for instance, one that we recommend
only because it's popular",00:22:13.940,00:22:16.660
"and it's cheap is called
namecheap.com.",00:22:16.660,00:22:18.855
"But you can go godaddy.com and
dozens of others out there.",00:22:18.855,00:22:22.860
You can read up on reviews.,00:22:22.860,00:22:24.420
"&gt;&gt; But for the most part it doesn't
matter from whom you",00:22:24.420,00:22:26.250
buy a domain name.,00:22:26.250,00:22:27.720
"And they vary in price and
they vary in suffix.",00:22:27.720,00:22:30.780
"The suffixes like .com, .net,
.org, .io, .tv, those",00:22:30.780,00:22:37.140
actually vary in price.,00:22:37.140,00:22:38.650
"But if we wanted to do something like
cats.com we can go to this website,",00:22:38.650,00:22:43.630
click Search.,00:22:43.630,00:22:44.280
Presumably this one is taken.,00:22:44.280,00:22:46.370
"But apparently, catsagainst.com
is available.",00:22:46.370,00:22:50.170
pluscats.com is available.,00:22:50.170,00:22:52.100
"Lovecats, catscorner, dampcats.net.",00:22:52.100,00:22:53.780
"All of this hopefully pseudo
randomly generated.",00:22:56.320,00:22:59.135
"If you want cats.pw, $1,500 only,
which is a bit insane.",00:22:59.135,00:23:04.670
"So someone has really snatched up all
the cat related domain names here for",00:23:04.670,00:23:08.100
varying prices.,00:23:08.100,00:23:09.840
"&gt;&gt; As an aside, let's see.",00:23:09.840,00:23:12.360
Who has cats.com?,00:23:12.360,00:23:13.710
"Know that you guys have at
your disposal fairly",00:23:13.710,00:23:16.290
sophisticated commands now.,00:23:16.290,00:23:17.540
"Like I can type literally
who is cats.com?",00:23:17.540,00:23:20.592
"And because of the way the internet is
structured you can actually see who",00:23:20.592,00:23:23.730
has registered this.,00:23:23.730,00:23:25.440
"Apparently this person is [INAUDIBLE]
using a proxy service.",00:23:25.440,00:23:30.240
"So whoever owns cats.com doesn't want
the world to know who they are.",00:23:30.240,00:23:33.900
"So they've registered if through
some random privacy service.",00:23:33.900,00:23:36.610
"But sometimes you actually
get actual owners.",00:23:36.610,00:23:39.100
"&gt;&gt; And this is to say, especially if you're
pursuing some startup and you",00:23:39.100,00:23:41.420
"really want some domain name and you're
willing to pay someone else for",00:23:41.420,00:23:44.640
"it, you can figure out contact
information in that way.",00:23:44.640,00:23:48.050
&gt;&gt; But also interesting is this.,00:23:48.050,00:23:49.940
Let me scroll up to this portion.,00:23:49.940,00:23:53.380
So this is that same output.,00:23:53.380,00:23:55.330
And this is just tacky.,00:23:55.330,00:23:56.990
"So apparently cats.com can be
yours for the right price.",00:23:56.990,00:24:00.740
"But what's interesting here
is that the name servers--",00:24:00.740,00:24:03.170
"this is total abuse of what a name
server's supposed to be-- your name",00:24:03.170,00:24:06.040
"server is not supposed to be
thisdomainforsale.com.",00:24:06.040,00:24:08.876
If we actually choose something like--,00:24:08.876,00:24:11.050
"let's choose something a little more
legitimate like, who is google.com,",00:24:11.050,00:24:15.181
and scroll up here.,00:24:15.181,00:24:17.030
So here--,00:24:17.030,00:24:18.280
what happened there?,00:24:20.600,00:24:21.740
Interesting.,00:24:21.740,00:24:22.480
Beyond who is--,00:24:22.480,00:24:25.290
let's keep it more low key.,00:24:25.290,00:24:26.610
&gt;&gt; Who is mit.edu?,00:24:26.610,00:24:28.370
OK.,00:24:28.370,00:24:28.810
This is helpful.,00:24:28.810,00:24:29.900
So this is what I was hoping for.,00:24:29.900,00:24:31.400
Legitimate use of the DNS service.,00:24:31.400,00:24:33.930
"Name servers here indicate
the following.",00:24:33.930,00:24:36.750
"This is MIT's way of saying, whenever
someone in the world, wherever they",00:24:36.750,00:24:40.880
"are, types in mit.edu and hits Enter,
your laptop, whether Mac or PC, will",00:24:40.880,00:24:46.950
"somehow eventually figure out that the
people in the world that know what the",00:24:46.950,00:24:51.830
"IP address is for mit.edu or any of the
sub domains at mit.edu or any of",00:24:51.830,00:24:58.130
"these servers here-- and it actually
looks like MITs infrastructure is",00:24:58.130,00:25:01.660
pretty robust as you would expect.,00:25:01.660,00:25:03.370
"They have multiple names servers
which is good for redundancy.",00:25:03.370,00:25:07.050
"And in fact, they seem to be globally
distributed across the world.",00:25:07.050,00:25:09.840
"A bunch of those seem to be in the US,
a couple in Asia, one in Europe, two",00:25:09.840,00:25:13.250
in somewhere else.,00:25:13.250,00:25:14.540
"&gt;&gt; But the point here is that DNS that
we've been taking for granted and",00:25:14.540,00:25:18.000
"generally described as a big Excel table
that has IP addresses and domain",00:25:18.000,00:25:21.990
"names is actually fairly sophisticated
hierarchical service so that in the",00:25:21.990,00:25:25.890
"world there's actually a finite number
of servers that essentially know where",00:25:25.890,00:25:29.170
"all of the .coms are or all of
the .nets are, all of the",00:25:29.170,00:25:32.880
".orgs are, and so forth.",00:25:32.880,00:25:34.650
"&gt;&gt; So when you go ahead and buy a domain
name from a place like Name Cheap or",00:25:34.650,00:25:37.820
"Go Daddy or any other website, one of
the key steps that you'll have to do",00:25:37.820,00:25:41.450
"you, if you do this even for your final
project, is tell the registrar",00:25:41.450,00:25:45.180
"from whom you're buying the domain
name, who in the world knows your",00:25:45.180,00:25:49.020
"website's IP addresses, who
your name servers are.",00:25:49.020,00:25:52.310
"&gt;&gt; So if you use, for instance CS50's
hosting account-- we happen to have",00:25:52.310,00:25:55.750
"this account through dreamhost.com
which is a",00:25:55.750,00:25:57.760
popular web hosting company--,00:25:57.760,00:25:59.560
"they will tell you that you should buy
your domain and tell the world that",00:25:59.560,00:26:03.530
"your domain's name server is
ns1.dreamhost.com, ns2.dreamhost.com,",00:26:03.530,00:26:09.410
and ns3.dreamhost.com.,00:26:09.410,00:26:11.470
&gt;&gt; But that's it.,00:26:11.470,00:26:12.600
"Buying a domain name means giving them
the money and getting ownership of the",00:26:12.600,00:26:15.480
"domain, but it's more like
a rental though.",00:26:15.480,00:26:17.190
"You get it for a year and then they bill
you recurringly for the rest of",00:26:17.190,00:26:20.060
"your life until you cancel
the domain name.",00:26:20.060,00:26:22.130
"And then you tell them who
the name servers are.",00:26:22.130,00:26:24.510
"But then you're done with
your registrar.",00:26:24.510,00:26:26.190
"And from there you'll interact only with
your web hosting company, which",00:26:26.190,00:26:30.130
in CS50's case will be DreamHost.,00:26:30.130,00:26:32.030
"But again, more documentation will be
provided to you if you decide to go",00:26:32.030,00:26:36.080
that route.,00:26:36.080,00:26:37.170
"&gt;&gt; So if you do this after the course's
end, simply googling web hosting",00:26:37.170,00:26:40.750
"company will turn up thousands
of options.",00:26:40.750,00:26:42.830
"And I would generally encourage you to
ask friends who might have used a",00:26:42.830,00:26:45.720
"company before if they recommend
them and had a good experience.",00:26:45.720,00:26:49.350
"&gt;&gt; Because there's a lot of fly by night
web hosting companies, like a guy in",00:26:49.350,00:26:52.680
"his basement with a server
that has an IP address.",00:26:52.680,00:26:55.220
"He has some extra RAM and hard disk
space and just sells web hosting",00:26:55.220,00:26:58.980
"accounts even though there's no way that
server could handle hundreds of",00:26:58.980,00:27:02.380
users or thousands of users.,00:27:02.380,00:27:04.050
"So realize you will get
what you pay for.",00:27:04.050,00:27:06.260
"&gt;&gt; For quite a while for my personal home
page-- and this was totally acceptable",00:27:06.260,00:27:09.510
"because I had, like, two
visitors a month--",00:27:09.510,00:27:11.830
"I was paying, like, $2.95 a month.",00:27:11.830,00:27:14.990
"And I'm pretty sure it was
in someone's basement.",00:27:14.990,00:27:17.230
"But again, you don't get necessarily
any guarantees of uptime or",00:27:17.230,00:27:20.800
scalability.,00:27:20.800,00:27:21.840
"So again, you're typically looking
at something more than that.",00:27:21.840,00:27:24.560
"&gt;&gt; Well, what about SSL?",00:27:24.560,00:27:26.220
So what's SSL used for?,00:27:26.220,00:27:27.690
"Let's now start to steer in the
directions of security and things that",00:27:27.690,00:27:30.320
can harm us.,00:27:30.320,00:27:32.330
"Especially as you venture
out on your own.",00:27:32.330,00:27:36.890
"&gt;&gt; What's SSL, or what's SSL used for?",00:27:36.890,00:27:41.650
"Security, OK.",00:27:41.650,00:27:42.660
So it's used for security.,00:27:42.660,00:27:44.000
What does that mean?,00:27:44.000,00:27:44.640
So it stands for Secure Sockets Layer.,00:27:44.640,00:27:47.170
"And it is indicated by a URL
that starts with https://.",00:27:47.170,00:27:52.330
"Many of us have probably never typed
https://, but you'll often find that",00:27:52.330,00:27:58.410
"your browser is redirected from HTTP to
HTTPS so that everything is there",00:27:58.410,00:28:03.000
after encrypted.,00:28:03.000,00:28:04.260
"&gt;&gt; FYI, using SSL requires typically that
you have a unique IP address.",00:28:04.260,00:28:10.810
"And typically to get a unique IP address
you need to pay a web hosting",00:28:10.810,00:28:13.940
company a few dollars more per month.,00:28:13.940,00:28:15.850
"So realize this is very easily
implemented these days by buying an IP",00:28:15.850,00:28:19.850
"address and by buying what's
called an SSL certificate.",00:28:19.850,00:28:22.930
"But realize that it does come
at some additional cost.",00:28:22.930,00:28:26.520
"And, as we'll try to scare in just a
bit, it's not even necessarily 100%",00:28:26.520,00:28:30.880
"protective of whatever it is
you're trying to protect.",00:28:30.880,00:28:34.040
"&gt;&gt; So for security, I'd thought I'd
do sort of a random segue here.",00:28:34.040,00:28:38.620
"As you might know from CS50's lecture
videos, our production team has been a",00:28:38.620,00:28:42.820
"fan as I have of taking really nice
photography of campus, and aerial",00:28:42.820,00:28:46.770
photography most recently.,00:28:46.770,00:28:48.370
"If you ever look up and you see
something flying with a little camera,",00:28:48.370,00:28:51.450
it may actually be CS50.,00:28:51.450,00:28:53.410
"And I just thought I'd share minute of
some of the footage the team has",00:28:53.410,00:28:55.830
"gathered, particularly as we look to
the spring semester and next fall.",00:28:55.830,00:28:59.450
"If any of you have a knack for
photography, videography, we would",00:28:59.450,00:29:03.320
"love to get you involved
behind the scenes.",00:29:03.320,00:29:05.570
But more on those details in a week.,00:29:05.570,00:29:07.595

related to security.",00:30:56.920,00:30:58.900
"But I thought that would be a more
fun way of just saying, security.",00:30:58.900,00:31:01.710
"So let's see if we can't scare you guys
now with not only a bit of a few",00:31:01.710,00:31:07.780
"threats, but also an underlying
understanding of what these threats",00:31:07.780,00:31:10.590
"are so that moving forward you can
decide how and whether to defend",00:31:10.590,00:31:13.830
"yourself against these things and at
least to be mindful of them as you",00:31:13.830,00:31:17.290
"make decisions as to whether or not to
send that email, whether or not to log",00:31:17.290,00:31:20.530
"into that website, whether or not to
use that cyber cafe's Wi-Fi access",00:31:20.530,00:31:24.920
"point so that you know what the
threats are indeed around you.",00:31:24.920,00:31:28.210
"&gt;&gt; So Jonathan referred to something
like this on Monday.",00:31:28.210,00:31:30.990
He had a window screen shot.,00:31:30.990,00:31:32.220
This one is of a Mac.,00:31:32.220,00:31:33.630
"How many of you have ever installed
software on your Mac or PC?",00:31:33.630,00:31:36.850
Obviously everyone.,00:31:36.850,00:31:38.420
"How many of you have given much thought
to typing in your password",00:31:38.420,00:31:41.590
when prompted?,00:31:41.590,00:31:43.030
"I mean, even I don't, frankly.",00:31:43.030,00:31:44.740
"So a couple of us are good
at being paranoid.",00:31:44.740,00:31:48.730
"But consider what you're
actually doing here.",00:31:48.730,00:31:50.490
"&gt;&gt; On a typical Mac or PC you have
an administrator account.",00:31:50.490,00:31:53.280
"And typically you're the only one using
a laptop at least these days.",00:31:53.280,00:31:56.450
"So your account, Malan or JHarvard
or whatever it is, is the",00:31:56.450,00:31:59.780
administrator account.,00:31:59.780,00:32:00.830
"And what that means is you have
root access to your computer.",00:32:00.830,00:32:03.530
"You can install anything you want,
delete anything you want.",00:32:03.530,00:32:06.180
"&gt;&gt; And typically these days, because of
dated design decisions from years ago,",00:32:06.180,00:32:10.800
"the way most software gets installed
is as an administrator.",00:32:10.800,00:32:14.560
"And even if your Mac or PC has at least
gotten smart enough over the",00:32:14.560,00:32:18.180
"years with the latest incarnations of
Mac OS and Windows to not run your",00:32:18.180,00:32:22.010
"username by default as the
administrator, when you download some",00:32:22.010,00:32:26.130
"new program off the internet and try to
install it, you're probably going",00:32:26.130,00:32:29.160
to be prompted for your password.,00:32:29.160,00:32:30.880
"But the catch is at that point, you're
literally handing the keys of your",00:32:30.880,00:32:34.790
"computer over to whatever random
program you just downloaded and",00:32:34.790,00:32:38.620
"allowing it to install
whatever it wants.",00:32:38.620,00:32:41.590
"&gt;&gt; And as Jonathan alluded to, realize
that it might say that it wants to",00:32:41.590,00:32:45.050
"install your software that you care
about, Spotify or iTunes or whatever",00:32:45.050,00:32:49.350
it is you're trying to install.,00:32:49.350,00:32:50.900
"But you're literally trusting the author
or authors of the software to",00:32:50.900,00:32:54.710
"only do what the program
is supposed to do.",00:32:54.710,00:32:57.570
"&gt;&gt; But there is absolutely nothing
stopping most programs on most",00:32:57.570,00:33:02.320
"operating systems from deleting files,
from uploading them to some company's",00:33:02.320,00:33:06.910
"website, from trolling around,
for encrypting things.",00:33:06.910,00:33:10.040
"And again, we've sort of built
an entire infrastructure over",00:33:10.040,00:33:12.970
the years on trust.,00:33:12.970,00:33:14.930
"And so realize that you've just been
trusting random people and random",00:33:14.930,00:33:18.690
companies for the most part.,00:33:18.690,00:33:20.050
"&gt;&gt; And Jonathan alluded to too, sometimes
those companies themselves are sort of",00:33:20.050,00:33:24.860
"knowingly malicious, all right?",00:33:24.860,00:33:26.410
"Sony caught a lot of flack a few years
ago for installing what was called a",00:33:26.410,00:33:30.200
"rootkit kit on people's computers
without their knowledge.",00:33:30.200,00:33:33.220
"And the gist of this was that when you
bought a CD for instance that they",00:33:33.220,00:33:36.570
"didn't want you to be able to copy or
rip the music off of, the CD would",00:33:36.570,00:33:40.050
"install, without your knowing,
a rootkit on your computer.",00:33:40.050,00:33:42.600
"Rootkit just meaning software that runs
as administrator that potentially",00:33:42.600,00:33:46.020
does bad things.,00:33:46.020,00:33:47.260
"&gt;&gt; But among the things this thing
did was it hid itself.",00:33:47.260,00:33:50.780
"So some of you might be pretty savvy
with your computer and know, well, I",00:33:50.780,00:33:53.660
"can just open the Task Manager or the
Activity Monitor and I can look at all",00:33:53.660,00:33:57.310
"of the arcanely named programs
that are running.",00:33:57.310,00:33:59.150
"And if anything looks suspicious
I'll just kill it or delete it.",00:33:59.150,00:34:01.760
But that's what the rootkit did.,00:34:01.760,00:34:02.980
"It essentially said, if running Task
Manager, don't show yourself.",00:34:02.980,00:34:07.070
&gt;&gt; So the software was there.,00:34:07.070,00:34:08.500
"And only if you really, really looked
hard could you even find it.",00:34:08.500,00:34:12.710
"And this was done in the name
of copy protection.",00:34:12.710,00:34:15.670
"But just imagine what could
have been done otherwise.",00:34:15.670,00:34:18.230
&gt;&gt; Now in terms of protecting yourself.,00:34:18.230,00:34:19.699
"A lot of websites are wonderfully
gracious in that they put these",00:34:19.699,00:34:22.190
"padlock icons on their homepage which
means that the website is secure.",00:34:22.190,00:34:26.480
"This is from bankofamerica.com
this morning.",00:34:26.480,00:34:28.870
"So what does that little padlock icon
there mean next to the Sign In button?",00:34:28.870,00:34:32.239
&gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing.,00:34:35.699,00:34:36.790
"It means someone knows how to use
Photoshop to make a picture of a",00:34:36.790,00:34:39.560
padlock icon.,00:34:39.560,00:34:40.590
"Like quite literally, the fact that it's
there is meant to be a positive",00:34:40.590,00:34:44.449
"signal to the user like,
ooh, secure website.",00:34:44.449,00:34:46.880
"I should trust this website and now
type in my username and password.",00:34:46.880,00:34:50.449
"And this has been conventional for
years, as recently as this morning.",00:34:50.449,00:34:53.870
"&gt;&gt; But consider the habits that
this is getting us into.",00:34:53.870,00:34:56.949
"Consider the implicit message that all
of these banks in this case have been",00:34:56.949,00:35:00.600
sending us for years.,00:35:00.600,00:35:01.830
"If you see padlock, then secure.",00:35:01.830,00:35:05.160
All right?,00:35:05.160,00:35:05.340
"&gt;&gt; So how can you abuse that system
of trust if you're the bad guy?",00:35:05.340,00:35:10.520
"Put a padlock on your website, and
logically, the users have been",00:35:10.520,00:35:14.100
"conditioned for years to assume
padlock means secure.",00:35:14.100,00:35:17.260
And it might actually be secure.,00:35:17.260,00:35:19.310
"You might have a wonderfully secure
SSL HTTPS connection to a",00:35:19.310,00:35:24.810
fake website .com.,00:35:24.810,00:35:26.452
"And no one else in the world can see
that you're about to hand him or her",00:35:26.452,00:35:30.150
"your username and password
to your account.",00:35:30.150,00:35:32.790
"&gt;&gt; This though, perhaps, is a
little more reassuring.",00:35:32.790,00:35:35.110
"So this is a screen shot of the top
of my browser this morning at",00:35:35.110,00:35:38.600
bankofamerica.com.,00:35:38.600,00:35:39.910
"And notice here too we
have a padlock icon.",00:35:39.910,00:35:43.270
"What does it mean in this context
in Chrome at least?",00:35:43.270,00:35:48.040
&gt;&gt; So this is now using SSL.,00:35:48.040,00:35:49.520
So this is actually a better thing.,00:35:49.520,00:35:51.220
"And the fact that Chrome is making it
green is meant to draw our attention",00:35:51.220,00:35:54.250
"to the fact that this is
not only over SSL.",00:35:54.250,00:35:56.750
"This is a company that someone out
there has verified is actually",00:35:56.750,00:36:01.400
bankofamerica.com.,00:36:01.400,00:36:02.520
"And that means that Bank of America,
when buying their so-called SSL",00:36:02.520,00:36:05.970
"certificate, essentially big random,
somewhat random numbers that implement",00:36:05.970,00:36:09.680
"security for them, they have been
verified by some independent third",00:36:09.680,00:36:14.710
"party that says, yep.",00:36:14.710,00:36:15.570
"This is actually the CEO of Bank of
America trying to buy the certificate.",00:36:15.570,00:36:19.240
"Chrome will therefore trust that
certification authority and say in",00:36:19.240,00:36:23.290
"green, this is bankofamerica.com.",00:36:23.290,00:36:25.265
"And Bank of America just pays a few
hundred dollars for that or a few",00:36:25.265,00:36:27.997
"thousand as opposed to a
few tens of dollars.",00:36:27.997,00:36:30.800
"&gt;&gt; But here too, how many of you have ever
behaved any differently because",00:36:30.800,00:36:34.940
"the URL in your browser is
green instead of black?",00:36:34.940,00:36:38.576
Right?,00:36:38.576,00:36:39.900
So a couple of us.,00:36:39.900,00:36:40.600
And that's good to be paranoid.,00:36:40.600,00:36:42.115
"But even then, those of you who even
notice these things, do you actually",00:36:42.115,00:36:45.910
"stop logging into an otherwise secure
website if the URL is not green?",00:36:45.910,00:36:50.720
"All right, so probably not, right?",00:36:50.720,00:36:53.380
"At least most of us, if it's not green,
most likely you're just going",00:36:53.380,00:36:56.740
"to be like, whatever.",00:36:56.740,00:36:57.440
"Like, I want to log into this website.",00:36:57.440,00:36:58.950
That's why I'm here.,00:36:58.950,00:37:00.200
I'm going to log in nonetheless.,00:37:00.200,00:37:02.390
"&gt;&gt; As an aside, Chrome is a little
better about this.",00:37:02.390,00:37:04.500
"But there's a lot of browsers like
Firefox for instance, at least for",00:37:04.500,00:37:07.990
"some time, where that padlock icon
is, you can actually put any",00:37:07.990,00:37:12.190
icon of your own.,00:37:12.190,00:37:13.250
"Let me see what the latest version
of Firefox looks like.",00:37:13.250,00:37:17.480
So if we go to CS50.net.,00:37:17.480,00:37:20.040
"&gt;&gt; OK, so they've gotten better as well.",00:37:20.040,00:37:21.580
"What the browsers used to do is like,
here's for instance [? SAAS's ?]",00:37:21.580,00:37:24.970
crest up here.,00:37:24.970,00:37:25.790
"That's the so-called favorite
icon for a website.",00:37:25.790,00:37:29.240
Years ago--,00:37:29.240,00:37:30.190
"actually not that long ago-- that little
shield would have been right",00:37:30.190,00:37:34.720
here next to the URL.,00:37:34.720,00:37:36.560
"Because some genius decided that it
would just look pretty classy to have",00:37:36.560,00:37:40.300
"your graphical logo right
next to your URL.",00:37:40.300,00:37:43.150
"And design wise, that actually
is pretty compelling.",00:37:43.150,00:37:45.310
&gt;&gt; So what did bad guy start doing?,00:37:45.310,00:37:47.240
"They started changing their favorite
icons, or their default icon for a",00:37:47.240,00:37:50.500
"homepage to be not a crest
but a padlock, which had",00:37:50.500,00:37:55.250
absolutely no meaning.,00:37:55.250,00:37:56.600
"Other than their favorite icon
was a padlock it had no",00:37:56.600,00:37:59.760
indications of security.,00:37:59.760,00:38:01.250
"&gt;&gt; So the lessons here are
a couple I think.",00:38:01.250,00:38:04.040
"One is that there are actually some
well intentioned mechanisms for",00:38:04.040,00:38:07.820
"teaching us users about security even
if you weren't even aware what green",00:38:07.820,00:38:12.850
meant or what even HTTPS meant.,00:38:12.850,00:38:15.110
"But if those mechanisms get us into
the bad habit of trusting websites",00:38:15.110,00:38:19.130
"when we see those positive signals,
they're very easily abused as we saw",00:38:19.130,00:38:23.390
"just a moment ago with something
silly like this.",00:38:23.390,00:38:26.480
"&gt;&gt; So session hijacking comes into
play, as we said before,",00:38:26.480,00:38:29.100
with cookies for instance.,00:38:29.100,00:38:30.510
And what does this actually mean?,00:38:30.510,00:38:32.130
"Well with session hijacking this is all
about stealing someone's cookies.",00:38:32.130,00:38:35.930
"So if I open up Chrome here, for
instance, and I open up the Inspector",00:38:35.930,00:38:39.860
"down here and I go to
the Network Tab--",00:38:39.860,00:38:41.550
and we've done this before--,00:38:41.550,00:38:42.830
"and I go to something like
http://facebook.com Enter, a whole",00:38:42.830,00:38:48.900
"bunch of stuff goes across the screen
because of all the images and CSS and",00:38:48.900,00:38:52.280
JavaScript files.,00:38:52.280,00:38:53.490
"&gt;&gt; But if I look at this one here notice
that Facebook is indeed planting one",00:38:53.490,00:38:59.420
"or more cookies on my
browser right here.",00:38:59.420,00:39:02.310
"So these are essentially the hand
stamps that represent me.",00:39:02.310,00:39:05.610
"And now hopefully my browser will
present this again and again when",00:39:05.610,00:39:08.580
revisiting that website.,00:39:08.580,00:39:10.560
"But that only is secure, we said a
couple weeks ago, if you're using SSL.",00:39:10.560,00:39:15.810
"&gt;&gt; But even SSL itself can
be compromised.",00:39:15.810,00:39:18.860
Consider after all the way SSL works.,00:39:18.860,00:39:21.800
"When your browser connects to a remote
server via https://, long story short,",00:39:21.800,00:39:28.860
cryptography is involved.,00:39:28.860,00:39:30.110
"It's not as simple as Caesar or
Visionaire or even DES, DES from a",00:39:30.110,00:39:34.750
while back in pset2.,00:39:34.750,00:39:36.110
It's more sophisticated than that.,00:39:36.110,00:39:37.410
It's called public key cryptography.,00:39:37.410,00:39:39.110
"But really big and really random
numbers are used to scramble",00:39:39.110,00:39:42.845
"information between point A, you,
and point B, like facebook.com.",00:39:42.845,00:39:47.125
"&gt;&gt; But the problem is, how many of us again
ever type in https:// to start",00:39:47.125,00:39:52.570
"our website connection
in that secure mode?",00:39:52.570,00:39:55.790
"I mean, how many of you even
type http://facebook.com?",00:39:55.790,00:40:00.900
"All right, if you do, like, hello.",00:40:00.900,00:40:02.290
"You don't need to do that
anymore, right?",00:40:02.290,00:40:03.510
The browser will figure it out.,00:40:03.510,00:40:05.190
"&gt;&gt; But most of us do indeed
just type facebook.com.",00:40:05.190,00:40:08.070
"Because if we're using a browser, the
browsers have gotten smart enough by",00:40:08.070,00:40:10.960
"2013 to assume if you're using a
browser, you type in an address, you",00:40:10.960,00:40:14.920
"probably want to access it not
via email or instant message.",00:40:14.920,00:40:18.550
You mean HTTP and Port 80.,00:40:18.550,00:40:21.250
Those conventions have been adopted.,00:40:21.250,00:40:22.970
&gt;&gt; But how does redirection work?,00:40:22.970,00:40:24.830
"Well, notice what happens here.",00:40:24.830,00:40:26.170
If I go back to Chrome--,00:40:26.170,00:40:27.590
"and let's do this in incognito
mode so that all of my",00:40:27.590,00:40:31.920
cookies are thrown away.,00:40:31.920,00:40:33.620
"And let me go here to,
again, facebook.com.",00:40:33.620,00:40:38.130
And let's see what happens.,00:40:38.130,00:40:39.490
"&gt;&gt; Recall that the first request was
indeed just for facebook.com.",00:40:39.490,00:40:43.372
But what was the response that I got?,00:40:43.372,00:40:46.580
It wasn't a 200 OK.,00:40:46.580,00:40:48.520
"It was 300, or 301, which is a
redirect telling me to go to",00:40:48.520,00:40:53.550
"http://www.facebook.com, which is
where Facebook wants me to go.",00:40:53.550,00:40:59.050
"But then if we look at the next request,
and we've seen this before,",00:40:59.050,00:41:01.900
notice what their second response is.,00:41:01.900,00:41:04.370
"Specifically that they want me now to
go to the SSL version of Facebook.",00:41:04.370,00:41:10.280
&gt;&gt; So here is an opportunity.,00:41:10.280,00:41:11.800
"This is a wonderfully useful feature
of just the web and HTTP.",00:41:11.800,00:41:15.440
"If the end user like Facebook wants me
to stay on the secure version of their",00:41:15.440,00:41:19.570
"website, great.",00:41:19.570,00:41:20.850
They will redirect me for myself.,00:41:20.850,00:41:23.130
"And so I don't have to even
think about that.",00:41:23.130,00:41:25.250
"&gt;&gt; But what if between point A and B,
between you and Facebook, there's some",00:41:25.250,00:41:29.200
"bad guy, there's some system
administrator at Harvard who's curious",00:41:29.200,00:41:32.220
to see who your friends are.,00:41:32.220,00:41:34.240
Or there's some--,00:41:34.240,00:41:36.760
"years ago, this used to sound crazy--",00:41:36.760,00:41:38.340
"but there's some government entity like
the NSA who's actually interested",00:41:38.340,00:41:41.950
in who you're poking on Facebook.,00:41:41.950,00:41:44.390
Where's the opportunity there?,00:41:44.390,00:41:45.910
"Well, so long as someone has enough
technical savvy and they have access",00:41:45.910,00:41:49.305
"to your actual network over Wi-Fi
or some physical wire,",00:41:49.305,00:41:53.350
what could they do?,00:41:53.350,00:41:54.570
"&gt;&gt; Well, if they're on the same network as
you and they know something about",00:41:54.570,00:41:57.520
"TCP/IP and IP addresses and DNS and how
all of that works, what if that",00:41:57.520,00:42:02.050
"man in the middle, what if that National
Security Agency, whatever it",00:42:02.050,00:42:05.970
"may be, but what if that entity simply
responds more quickly than Facebook to",00:42:05.970,00:42:11.480
"your HTTP request and says,
oh, I am Facebook.",00:42:11.480,00:42:15.820
"Go ahead, and here's the
HTML for facebook.com.",00:42:15.820,00:42:19.300
&gt;&gt; Computers are pretty darn fast.,00:42:19.300,00:42:20.720
"So you could write a program running on
a server like nsa.gov that when it",00:42:20.720,00:42:25.990
"hears a request from you for
facebook.com, very quickly behind the",00:42:25.990,00:42:29.790
"scenes gets the real facebook.com making
a perfectly [? esque ?] secure",00:42:29.790,00:42:34.000
"SSL connection between NSA and between
Facebook, getting that HTML very",00:42:34.000,00:42:38.290
"securely for the login page, and then
the NSA server just responds to you",00:42:38.290,00:42:42.670
with a login page for facebook.com.,00:42:42.670,00:42:44.942
"&gt;&gt; Now how many of you would even notice
that you're using Facebook over HTTP",00:42:44.942,00:42:49.120
"still at that point because you've
accidentally connected to nsa.gov and",00:42:49.120,00:42:53.375
not Facebook?,00:42:53.375,00:42:53.870
The URLs not changing.,00:42:53.870,00:42:54.980
"All of this is being done
behind the scenes.",00:42:54.980,00:42:57.040
"But most of us, myself included,
probably wouldn't notice",00:42:57.040,00:42:59.470
such a minor detail.,00:42:59.470,00:43:00.800
"&gt;&gt; So you might have a perfectly workable
connection between you and what you",00:43:00.800,00:43:05.510
"think is Facebook, but there's a
so-called man in the middle.",00:43:05.510,00:43:08.660
"And this is a general term for man in
the middle attack where you have some",00:43:08.660,00:43:12.480
"entity between you and point B that's
somehow manipulating, stealing, or",00:43:12.480,00:43:17.670
watching your data.,00:43:17.670,00:43:18.960
"So even SSL is not surefire, especially
if you've been tricked into",00:43:18.960,00:43:22.750
"not turning it on because of how these
underlying mechanisms actually work.",00:43:22.750,00:43:26.790
"&gt;&gt; So a lesson today then too is if you
really want to be paranoid--",00:43:26.790,00:43:30.670
and even here there are threats--,00:43:30.670,00:43:32.110
"you should really start getting into
the habit of typing in https://www",00:43:32.110,00:43:37.112
"whatever domain name you
actually care about.",00:43:37.112,00:43:39.850
"&gt;&gt; And as an aside too there's
yet another threat with",00:43:39.850,00:43:41.820
regard to session hijacking.,00:43:41.820,00:43:43.410
"Very often when you first visit a
website like facebook.com, unless the",00:43:43.410,00:43:47.440
"server has been configured to say that
that hand stamp it put on you",00:43:47.440,00:43:51.050
"yesterday should be secure itself, your
browser might very well, upon",00:43:51.050,00:43:56.140
"visiting things like facebook.com
google.com, twitter.com, your browser",00:43:56.140,00:44:00.620
"might be presenting that hand stamp only
to be slapped down and said, no.",00:44:00.620,00:44:04.280
Use SSL.,00:44:04.280,00:44:05.660
&gt;&gt; But it's too late at that point.,00:44:05.660,00:44:07.030
"If you have already sent your hand
stamp, your cookie, in the clear with",00:44:07.030,00:44:10.940
"no SSL, you have a split second
vulnerability where someone sniffing",00:44:10.940,00:44:15.180
"your traffic, whether roommate or NSA,
can then use that same cookie, and",00:44:15.180,00:44:19.530
"with a bit of technical savvy,
present it as his or her own.",00:44:19.530,00:44:23.860
"&gt;&gt; Another attack you might
not have thought about.",00:44:23.860,00:44:25.930
"This one is really on you if you screw
this up in writing some website that",00:44:25.930,00:44:30.120
somehow uses SQL.,00:44:30.120,00:44:31.580
"So here, for instance, is a screen
shot of Harvard's login.",00:44:31.580,00:44:34.610
"And this is a general example
of something with a",00:44:34.610,00:44:36.380
username and password.,00:44:36.380,00:44:37.480
Super common.,00:44:37.480,00:44:38.440
"So let's assume that SSL exists and
there's no man in the middle or",00:44:38.440,00:44:41.310
anything like that.,00:44:41.310,00:44:41.920
"Now we're focusing on the server's
code that you might write.",00:44:41.920,00:44:45.660
"&gt;&gt; Well, when I type in a username and
password, suppose that the PIN service",00:44:45.660,00:44:49.830
is implemented in PHP.,00:44:49.830,00:44:51.740
"And you might have some code
on that server like this.",00:44:51.740,00:44:53.990
"Get the user name from the post super
global and get the password, and then",00:44:53.990,00:44:57.740
"if they're using some pset7 like
code there's a query function",00:44:57.740,00:45:01.130
that might do this.,00:45:01.130,00:45:01.820
"Select Star from users where username
equals that and password equals that.",00:45:01.820,00:45:06.320
"&gt;&gt; That looks, at first glance,
totally reasonable.",00:45:06.320,00:45:08.120
This is syntactically valid PHP code.,00:45:08.120,00:45:11.090
"Logically there's nothing
wrong with this.",00:45:11.090,00:45:13.160
"Presumably there's some more lines that
actually do something with the",00:45:13.160,00:45:15.710
"result that comes back
from the database.",00:45:15.710,00:45:18.150
"But this is vulnerable for
the following reason.",00:45:18.150,00:45:20.580
"&gt;&gt; Notice that, like a good citizen,
I have put in quotes, single",00:45:20.580,00:45:23.760
"quotes, the user name.",00:45:23.760,00:45:25.380
"And I put in single quotes
the password.",00:45:25.380,00:45:26.980
"And that's a good thing because they're
not supposed to be numbers.",00:45:26.980,00:45:28.830
Typically they're going to be text.,00:45:28.830,00:45:30.660
So I'm quoting them like strings.,00:45:30.660,00:45:32.290
"&gt;&gt; And if I now advance further what if--
and I've removed the bullets from the",00:45:32.290,00:45:37.470
PIN service temporarily--,00:45:37.470,00:45:38.870
"what if I try to log in as
President [? Scroob ?]",00:45:38.870,00:45:41.650
"but I claim that my password is
12345' OR '1'='1, and notice",00:45:41.650,00:45:52.540
what I haven't done.,00:45:52.540,00:45:53.830
"I did not close the other
single quote.",00:45:53.830,00:45:56.140
"Because I'm pretty sharp
here as the bad guy.",00:45:56.140,00:45:58.500
"And I'm assuming they're you're
not very good with your",00:45:58.500,00:46:01.870
PHP and MySQL code.,00:46:01.870,00:46:03.450
"I'm guessing that you're not checking
for the presence of quotes.",00:46:03.450,00:46:06.740
"&gt;&gt; So what just happened is that when your
user has typed in that string,",00:46:06.740,00:46:11.190
"the query you're about to
create looks like this.",00:46:11.190,00:46:15.060
"And long story short, if you and
something together or you or something",00:46:15.060,00:46:18.180
"together this is going to return
a row from the database.",00:46:18.180,00:46:21.740
"Because it is always the
case that 1 equals 1.",00:46:21.740,00:46:26.570
"&gt;&gt; And just because you didn't anticipate
that your users, good or bad, might",00:46:26.570,00:46:30.400
"have an apostrophe in their name you
have created a SQL query that's still",00:46:30.400,00:46:35.340
"valid, and will return now more results
than you might have intended.",00:46:35.340,00:46:39.040
"And so this bad guy now has potentially
logged in to your server",00:46:39.040,00:46:42.340
"because your database is returning a row
even if he or she has no idea what",00:46:42.340,00:46:47.060
[? Scroob's ?] actual password is.,00:46:47.060,00:46:49.410
"&gt;&gt; Oh, I realized a typo here.",00:46:49.410,00:46:50.640
"I should've said password equals
12345 like the previous",00:46:50.640,00:46:53.260
example or 1 equals 1.,00:46:53.260,00:46:54.990
I'll fix that online.,00:46:54.990,00:46:56.400
"&gt;&gt; So why did we have you using the query
function with question marks?",00:46:56.400,00:46:59.960
"One of the things the query function
does for you is it makes sure that",00:46:59.960,00:47:04.000
"when you pass in arguments after the
commas here like this that the query",00:47:04.000,00:47:07.660
"that's actually sent to the
database looks like this.",00:47:07.660,00:47:10.330
"A lot uglier to look at, but back
slashes have been automatically",00:47:10.330,00:47:13.830
"inserted to avoid precisely that
injection attack that I showed a",00:47:13.830,00:47:19.030
moment ago.,00:47:19.030,00:47:20.270
"&gt;&gt; Now a fun XKCD that I thought I'd pull
up here that hopefully should now be a",00:47:20.270,00:47:24.930
"little more understandable
is this one here.",00:47:24.930,00:47:28.546
&gt;&gt; A little bit?,00:47:39.460,00:47:40.265
"Maybe we need a little more
discussion on that.",00:47:40.265,00:47:42.370
"So this is alluding to a little kid
named Bobby who has somehow taken",00:47:42.370,00:47:47.810
"advantage of a website that is just
trusting that what the user has typed",00:47:47.810,00:47:52.250
"in is not, in fact, SQL code,
but is in fact a string.",00:47:52.250,00:47:55.100
&gt;&gt; Now you may recall that drop--,00:47:55.100,00:47:56.830
"you might have seen this-- drop means
delete a table, delete a database.",00:47:56.830,00:48:00.190
"So if you essentially claim that
your name is Robert"";droptabl",00:48:00.190,00:48:02.235
"estudentsomething, ]",00:48:02.235,00:48:03.485

"indeed Robert, but semicolon also
proceed to drop the table.",00:48:09.370,00:48:13.530
"&gt;&gt; And so SQL injection attacks can
actually be as threatening as this",00:48:13.530,00:48:17.560
"whereby you can delete someone's data,
you can select more datas than",00:48:17.560,00:48:20.740
"intended, you can insert

"Or literally just type apostrophe,
hit Enter, and see what happens.",00:48:39.740,00:48:42.990
