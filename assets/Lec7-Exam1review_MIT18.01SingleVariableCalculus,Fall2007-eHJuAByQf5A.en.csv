"PROFESSOR: Right now,
we're finishing up",00:00:21.700,00:00:25.000
"with the first
unit, and I'd like",00:00:25.000,00:00:27.740
"to continue in this
lecture, lecture seven,",00:00:27.740,00:00:31.890
"with some final remarks
about exponents.",00:00:31.890,00:00:45.510
"So what I'd like to do
is just review something",00:00:45.510,00:00:49.560
"that I did quickly
last time, and make",00:00:49.560,00:00:51.910
"a few philosophical
remarks about it.",00:00:51.910,00:00:53.920
"I think that the steps involved
were maybe a little tricky,",00:00:53.920,00:00:57.660
"and so I'd like to go
through it one more time.",00:00:57.660,00:01:00.680
"Remember, that we were
talking about this number a_k,",00:01:00.680,00:01:03.900
which is (1 + 1/k)^k.,00:01:03.900,00:01:05.510
"And what we showed was
that the limit as k",00:01:08.270,00:01:11.400
goes to infinity of a_k was e.,00:01:11.400,00:01:16.920
"So the first thing
that I'd like to do",00:01:16.920,00:01:19.590
"is just explain the proof
a little bit more clearly",00:01:19.590,00:01:22.890
"than I did last time
with fewer symbols,",00:01:22.890,00:01:28.440
"or at least with this
abbreviation of the symbol",00:01:28.440,00:01:31.830
"here, to show you
what we actually did.",00:01:31.830,00:01:35.050
"So I'll just remind you
of what we did last time,",00:01:35.050,00:01:41.580
"and the first
observation was to check,",00:01:41.580,00:01:45.726
"rather than the limit
of this function,",00:01:45.726,00:01:47.350
but to take the log first.,00:01:47.350,00:01:49.550
"And this is
typically what's done",00:01:49.550,00:01:51.640
"when you have an exponential,
when you have an exponent.",00:01:51.640,00:01:54.810
"And what we found was
that the limit here",00:01:54.810,00:01:57.750
was 1 as k goes to infinity.,00:01:57.750,00:02:03.500
"So last time, this
is what we did.",00:02:03.500,00:02:05.160
"And I just wanted to
be careful and show you",00:02:05.160,00:02:07.970
exactly what the next step is.,00:02:07.970,00:02:09.830
"If you exponentiate this fact;
you take e to this power,",00:02:09.830,00:02:14.360
"that's going to tend to
e^1, which is just e.",00:02:14.360,00:02:21.230
"And then, we just observe
that this is the same as a_k.",00:02:21.230,00:02:26.570
"So the basic ingredient
here is that e^ln a = a.",00:02:26.570,00:02:32.180
"That's because the log
function is the inverse",00:02:32.180,00:02:36.750
of the exponential function.,00:02:36.750,00:02:38.030
"Yes, question?",00:02:38.030,00:02:38.860
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:02:38.860,00:02:54.190
"PROFESSOR: So the question
was, wouldn't the log of this",00:02:54.190,00:02:58.180
"be 0 because a_k
is tending to 1.",00:02:58.180,00:03:01.530
But a_k isn't tending to 1.,00:03:01.530,00:03:03.830
Who said it was?,00:03:03.830,00:03:06.640
"If you take the logarithm,
which is what we did last time,",00:03:06.640,00:03:10.040
"logarithm of a_k is
indeed k * ln(1 + 1/k).",00:03:10.040,00:03:12.880
That does not tend to 0.,00:03:17.030,00:03:18.520
"This part of it tends to 0, and
this part tends to infinity.",00:03:18.520,00:03:22.610
"And they balance each
other, 0 times infinity.",00:03:22.610,00:03:26.460
"We don't really know yet
from this expression,",00:03:26.460,00:03:28.460
"in fact we did some cleverness
with limits and derivatives,",00:03:28.460,00:03:32.189
to figure out this limit.,00:03:32.189,00:03:33.230
It was a very subtle thing.,00:03:33.230,00:03:34.354
It turned out to be 1.,00:03:34.354,00:03:37.560
All right?,00:03:37.560,00:03:38.850
"Now, the thing that
I'd like to say",00:03:38.850,00:03:40.645
"- I'm sorry I'm going
to erase this aside here",00:03:40.645,00:03:43.550
"- but you need to go
back to your notes",00:03:43.550,00:03:46.100
"and remember that this
is what we did last time.",00:03:46.100,00:03:48.824
"Because I want to
have room for the next",00:03:48.824,00:03:50.490
"comment that I want to make on
this little blackboard here.",00:03:50.490,00:03:54.420
"What we just derived
was this property here,",00:03:54.420,00:03:57.090
"but I made a claim
yesterday, and I just",00:03:57.090,00:04:01.810
"want to emphasize it
again so that we realized",00:04:01.810,00:04:04.120
what it is that we're doing.,00:04:04.120,00:04:07.786
I looked at this backwards.,00:04:07.786,00:04:08.910
"One way you can think of this
is we're evaluating this limit",00:04:08.910,00:04:11.430
and getting an answer.,00:04:11.430,00:04:13.000
"But all equalities can
be read both directions.",00:04:13.000,00:04:16.524
"And we can write
it the other way:",00:04:16.524,00:04:17.940
"e equals the limit, as k goes
to infinity, of this expression",00:04:17.940,00:04:25.881
here.,00:04:25.881,00:04:26.380
So that's just the same thing.,00:04:26.380,00:04:28.640
"And if we read it
backwards, what we're saying",00:04:28.640,00:04:30.840
"is that this limit
is a formula for e.",00:04:30.840,00:04:35.700
"So this is very
typical of mathematics.",00:04:35.700,00:04:38.325
"You want to always reverse
your perspective all the time.",00:04:38.325,00:04:40.700
"Equations work both
ways, and in this case,",00:04:40.700,00:04:43.710
"we have two different
things here.",00:04:43.710,00:04:46.300
"This e was what we
defined as the base,",00:04:46.300,00:04:49.430
"which when you graph e^x,
you get slope 1 at 0.",00:04:49.430,00:04:54.461
"And then it turns out to be
equal to this limit, which",00:04:54.461,00:04:56.710
we can calculate numerically.,00:04:56.710,00:04:59.060
"If you do this on your
calculators, you, of course,",00:04:59.060,00:05:02.100
"will have a way of
programming in this number",00:05:02.100,00:05:05.420
and evaluating it for each k.,00:05:05.420,00:05:07.290
"And you'll have another button
available to evaluate this one.",00:05:07.290,00:05:10.880
"So another way of
saying it is it",00:05:10.880,00:05:12.432
"that there's a relationship
between these two things.",00:05:12.432,00:05:14.640
"And all of calculus is a matter
of getting these relationships.",00:05:14.640,00:05:19.210
"So we can look at these things
in several different ways.",00:05:19.210,00:05:21.860
"And indeed, that's
what we're going",00:05:21.860,00:05:23.350
"to be doing at least
at the end of today",00:05:23.350,00:05:25.832
in talking about derivatives.,00:05:25.832,00:05:27.040
"A lot of times when we
talk about derivatives,",00:05:27.040,00:05:29.480
"we're trying to look at them
from several perspectives",00:05:29.480,00:05:32.230
at once.,00:05:32.230,00:05:34.780
"Okay, so I have to keep
on going with exponents,",00:05:34.780,00:05:37.280
because I have one loose end.,00:05:37.280,00:05:40.130
"One loose end that
I did not cover yet.",00:05:40.130,00:05:44.490
"There's one very important
formula that's left,",00:05:44.490,00:05:48.330
"and it's the derivative
of the powers.",00:05:48.330,00:05:51.920
"We actually didn't
do this - well we",00:05:51.920,00:05:54.070
did it for rational numbers r.,00:05:54.070,00:05:57.120
So this is the formula here.,00:05:57.120,00:06:00.070
"But now we're going to check
this for all real numbers, r.",00:06:00.070,00:06:06.200
"So including all the
irrational ones as well.",00:06:06.200,00:06:09.200
"This is also good
practice for using base e",00:06:09.200,00:06:13.690
"and using logarithmic
differentiation.",00:06:13.690,00:06:16.480
"So let me do this
by our two methods",00:06:16.480,00:06:20.810
"that we can use to handle
exponential type problems.",00:06:20.810,00:06:26.160
So method one was base e.,00:06:26.160,00:06:32.070
"So if I just rewrite
this base e again,",00:06:32.070,00:06:34.040
"that's just this
formula over here.",00:06:34.040,00:06:36.910
"x^r = (e^ln x)^r,
which is e^r ln x.",00:06:36.910,00:06:50.350
"Okay, so now I can
differentiate this.",00:06:50.350,00:06:55.320
"So I get that d/dx (x^r),
now I'm going to use prime",00:06:55.320,00:07:04.650
"notation, because I don't want
to keep on writing that d/dx",00:07:04.650,00:07:07.460
here; (e^(r ln x))'.,00:07:07.460,00:07:10.580
"And now, what I can do is
I can use the chain rule.",00:07:13.890,00:07:18.457
"The chain rule says
that it's the derivative",00:07:18.457,00:07:20.290
"of this times the
derivative of the function.",00:07:20.290,00:07:24.380
"So the derivative of the
exponential is just itself.",00:07:24.380,00:07:29.500
"And the derivative
of this guy here,",00:07:29.500,00:07:31.470
"well I'll write it out
once, is (r ln x)'.",00:07:31.470,00:07:35.400
So what's that equal to?,00:07:39.700,00:07:42.250
"Well, e^(r ln x) is is just x^r.",00:07:42.250,00:07:45.890
"And this derivative here is--
Well the derivative of r is 0.",00:07:45.890,00:07:53.870
This is a constant.,00:07:53.870,00:07:54.860
It just factors out.,00:07:54.860,00:07:56.680
"And ln x now has derivative--
What's the derivative of ln x?",00:07:56.680,00:08:02.070
"1/x, so this is going
to be times r/x.",00:08:02.070,00:08:06.570
"And now, we rewrite it in the
customary form, which is r,",00:08:06.570,00:08:10.180
"we put the r in front, x^(r-1).",00:08:10.180,00:08:13.040
Okay?,00:08:13.040,00:08:13.820
"So I just derived
the formula for you.",00:08:13.820,00:08:19.060
"And it didn't matter whether
r was rational or irrational,",00:08:19.060,00:08:23.310
it's the same proof.,00:08:23.310,00:08:25.320
"Okay so now I have to show you
how method two works as well.",00:08:25.320,00:08:29.440
"So let's do method
two, which we call",00:08:29.440,00:08:34.550
logarithmic differentiation.,00:08:34.550,00:08:39.280
"And so here I'll use a
symbol, say u, for x^r,",00:08:39.280,00:08:43.764
and I'll take its logarithm.,00:08:43.764,00:08:44.930
That's r ln x.,00:08:44.930,00:08:50.480
And now I differentiate it.,00:08:50.480,00:08:51.830
"I'll leave that in
the middle, because I",00:08:51.830,00:08:54.160
"want to remember
the key property",00:08:54.160,00:08:55.979
of logarithmic differentiation.,00:08:55.979,00:08:57.270
But first I'll differentiate it.,00:08:57.270,00:08:58.747
"Later on, what I'm going to
use is that this is the same",00:08:58.747,00:09:01.080
as u'/u.,00:09:01.080,00:09:02.620
"This is one way of evaluating
a logarithmic derivative.",00:09:02.620,00:09:06.470
"And then the other
is to differentiate",00:09:06.470,00:09:08.660
"the explicit function
that we have over here.",00:09:08.660,00:09:10.980
"And that is just,
as we said, r/x.",00:09:10.980,00:09:16.790
"So now, I multiply through, and
I get u' = ur/x which is just",00:09:16.790,00:09:25.470
"x^r r/x, which is just
what we did before.",00:09:25.470,00:09:29.750
It's r x^(r-1).,00:09:29.750,00:09:30.520
"Again, you can now
see by comparing",00:09:33.410,00:09:36.790
"these two pieces of arithmetic
that they're basically",00:09:36.790,00:09:40.110
the same.,00:09:40.110,00:09:41.470
"Pretty much every time
you convert to base e",00:09:41.470,00:09:43.510
"or you do logarithmic
differentiation,",00:09:43.510,00:09:45.170
"it'll amount to the
same thing, provided",00:09:45.170,00:09:46.836
you don't get mixed up.,00:09:46.836,00:09:48.270
"You generally have to
introduce a new symbol here.",00:09:48.270,00:09:51.720
"On the other hand, you're
dealing with exponents there.",00:09:51.720,00:09:55.840
"It's worth it to know
both points of view.",00:09:55.840,00:10:00.990
"All right, so now I want to
make one last remark before we",00:10:00.990,00:10:07.470
finish with exponents.,00:10:07.470,00:10:09.910
"And, I'll try to sell this
to you in a lot of ways",00:10:09.910,00:10:16.120
"as the course goes on,
but one thing that I",00:10:16.120,00:10:19.490
"want to try to emphasize is that
the natural logarithm really",00:10:19.490,00:10:23.370
is natural.,00:10:23.370,00:10:27.210
"So, I claim that the
natural log is natural.",00:10:27.210,00:10:39.920
"And the example that we're going
to use for this illustration",00:10:39.920,00:10:45.900
is economics.,00:10:45.900,00:10:53.340
Okay?,00:10:53.340,00:10:54.090
"So let me explain to why the
natural log is the one that's",00:10:54.090,00:10:58.520
natural for economics.,00:10:58.520,00:11:00.820
"If you are imagining the
price of a stock that you own",00:11:00.820,00:11:06.040
"goes down by a dollar, that's a
totally meaningless statement.",00:11:06.040,00:11:11.160
It depends on a lot of things.,00:11:11.160,00:11:13.439
"In particular, it depends on
whether the original price",00:11:13.439,00:11:15.730
was a dollar or 100 dollars.,00:11:15.730,00:11:18.300
"So there's not much meaning
to these absolute numbers.",00:11:18.300,00:11:22.130
"It's always the
ratios that matter.",00:11:22.130,00:11:25.080
"So, for example, I just
looked up an hour ago,",00:11:25.080,00:11:29.280
"the London Exchange closed,
and it was down 27.9,",00:11:29.280,00:11:42.050
"which as I said, is
pretty meaningless",00:11:42.050,00:11:44.480
"unless you know what the
actual total of this index is.",00:11:44.480,00:11:50.050
"It turns out it was 6,432.",00:11:50.050,00:11:54.200
"So the change in
the price, divided",00:11:54.200,00:11:57.070
"by the price, which in
this case is 27.9 / 6,432,",00:11:57.070,00:12:03.980
is what matters.,00:12:03.980,00:12:07.550
"And, in this case, it
happens to be .43%.",00:12:07.550,00:12:11.791
All right?,00:12:11.791,00:12:12.290
That's what happened today.,00:12:12.290,00:12:14.270
"And similarly, if you take
the infinitesimal of this,",00:12:14.270,00:12:18.410
"people think of days as being
relatively small increments",00:12:18.410,00:12:21.260
"when you're
investing in a stock,",00:12:21.260,00:12:23.900
"you would be interested in
the infinitesimal sense,",00:12:23.900,00:12:27.240
you would be interested in p'/p.,00:12:27.240,00:12:28.690
"The derivative of
p divided by p.",00:12:28.690,00:12:33.080
That's just (ln p)'.,00:12:33.080,00:12:35.530
"So this is the - let me
put a little box around it",00:12:38.160,00:12:42.275
"- the formula of
logarithmic differentiation.",00:12:42.275,00:12:45.460
"But let me just emphasize that
it has an actual significance,",00:12:45.460,00:12:49.700
"and it's the one that's used
by economists and people who",00:12:49.700,00:12:52.430
"are modeling prices of
things all the time.",00:12:52.430,00:12:54.450
"They never use absolute prices
when there are large swings.",00:12:54.450,00:12:58.620
"They always use the
log of the price.",00:12:58.620,00:13:01.010
"And there's no point in using
log base 10, or log base 2.",00:13:01.010,00:13:07.010
Those give you junk.,00:13:07.010,00:13:08.180
"They give you an
extra factor of log 2.",00:13:08.180,00:13:11.190
"It's the natural log that's
the obvious one to use.",00:13:11.190,00:13:14.870
"It's completely
straightforward that this",00:13:14.870,00:13:18.000
"is a simpler expression
than using log base 10",00:13:18.000,00:13:21.010
"and having a factor of
natural log of 10 there,",00:13:21.010,00:13:24.030
"which would just
mess everything up.",00:13:24.030,00:13:26.800
"All right, so this is
just one illustration.",00:13:26.800,00:13:29.360
"Anything that has
to do with ratios",00:13:29.360,00:13:31.680
"is going to
encounter logarithms.",00:13:31.680,00:13:36.160
"All right, so that's
pretty much it.",00:13:36.160,00:13:41.270
"That's all I want to
say for now anyway.",00:13:41.270,00:13:45.822
"There's lots more
to say, but we'll",00:13:45.822,00:13:47.280
"be saying it when we do
applications of derivatives",00:13:47.280,00:13:50.459
in the second unit.,00:13:50.459,00:13:51.250
"So now, what I'd like to
do is to start a review.",00:13:51.250,00:13:54.450
"I'm just going to run through
what we did in this unit.",00:13:54.450,00:13:57.790
"I'll tell you
approximately what I",00:13:57.790,00:13:59.700
"expect from you on the test
that's coming up tomorrow.",00:13:59.700,00:14:06.150
"And, well, so let's
get started with that.",00:14:06.150,00:14:14.640
So this is a review of Unit One.,00:14:14.640,00:14:27.050
"And I'm just going to put on
the board all of the things",00:14:27.050,00:14:32.610
"that you need to think about,
anyway, keep in your head.",00:14:32.610,00:14:35.750
"And there are what are
called general formulas",00:14:35.750,00:14:41.750
for derivatives.,00:14:41.750,00:14:45.070
"And then there are
the specific ones.",00:14:45.070,00:14:51.970
"And let me just remind you
what the general formulas are.",00:14:51.970,00:14:55.920
"There's what you
do to differentiate",00:14:55.920,00:14:58.750
"a sum, a multiple of a
function, the product",00:14:58.750,00:15:04.190
"rule, the quotient rule.",00:15:04.190,00:15:08.190
"Those are several
general formulas.",00:15:08.190,00:15:11.550
"And then there's
one more, which is",00:15:11.550,00:15:13.080
"the chain rule, which
I'm going to say just",00:15:13.080,00:15:15.780
a little bit more about.,00:15:15.780,00:15:17.450
"So the derivative of a
function of a function",00:15:17.450,00:15:21.200
"is the derivative of the
function times the derivative",00:15:21.200,00:15:26.380
of the other function.,00:15:26.380,00:15:27.430
"So here, I've
abbreviated u is u(x).",00:15:27.430,00:15:33.780
"Right, so this is one of
two ways of writing it.",00:15:33.780,00:15:36.630
"The other way is also one
that you can keep in mind",00:15:36.630,00:15:39.850
"and you might find
easier to remember.",00:15:39.850,00:15:42.470
"It's probably a good idea
to remember both formulas.",00:15:42.470,00:15:46.690
"And then the last type
of general formula",00:15:46.690,00:15:49.660
"that we did was implicit
differentiation.",00:15:49.660,00:15:56.950
Okay?,00:15:56.950,00:15:59.200
"So when you do implicit
differentiation,",00:15:59.200,00:16:03.190
"you have an equation
and you don't",00:16:03.190,00:16:06.530
"try to solve for the
unknown function.",00:16:06.530,00:16:09.270
"You just put it in its simplest
form and you differentiate.",00:16:09.270,00:16:13.110
"So, we actually did this,
in particular, for inverses.",00:16:13.110,00:16:20.440
"That was a very, very key
method for calculating",00:16:20.440,00:16:23.520
the inverses of functions.,00:16:23.520,00:16:25.180
"And it's also true that
logarithmic differentiation",00:16:25.180,00:16:28.600
is of this type.,00:16:28.600,00:16:31.420
This is a transformation.,00:16:31.420,00:16:33.299
"We're differentiating
something else.",00:16:33.299,00:16:34.840
"We're transforming the equation
by taking its logarithm",00:16:34.840,00:16:37.920
and then differentiating.,00:16:37.920,00:16:40.980
"Okay, so there are a number of
different ways this is applied.",00:16:40.980,00:16:45.200
"It can also be applied,
anyway, these are two of them.",00:16:45.200,00:16:48.450
So maybe in parenthesis.,00:16:48.450,00:16:50.320
These are just examples.,00:16:50.320,00:16:53.120
All right.,00:16:53.120,00:16:54.350
"I'll try to give examples of
at least a few of these rules",00:16:54.350,00:16:59.461
later.,00:16:59.461,00:16:59.960
"So now, the specific
functions that you know how",00:16:59.960,00:17:05.670
"to differentiate: well you know
how to differentiate now x^r",00:17:05.670,00:17:08.360
thanks to what I just did.,00:17:08.360,00:17:11.410
"We have the sine and
the cosine functions,",00:17:11.410,00:17:15.030
"which you're
responsible for knowing",00:17:15.030,00:17:17.910
what their derivatives are.,00:17:17.910,00:17:19.500
"And then other trig functions
like tan and secant.",00:17:19.500,00:17:26.490
"We generally don't bother
with cosecants and cotangents,",00:17:26.490,00:17:29.810
"because everything can be
expressed in terms of these",00:17:29.810,00:17:32.710
anyway.,00:17:32.710,00:17:33.759
"Actually, you can really
express everything",00:17:33.759,00:17:35.550
in terms of sines and cosines.,00:17:35.550,00:17:36.906
"But what you'll
find is that it's",00:17:36.906,00:17:38.280
"much more convenient to remember
the derivatives of these",00:17:38.280,00:17:41.660
as well.,00:17:41.660,00:17:42.730
So memorize all of these.,00:17:42.730,00:17:45.870
"All right, and then
we had e^x and ln x.",00:17:45.870,00:17:49.810
"And we had the inverses
of the trig functions.",00:17:49.810,00:17:53.920
"These were the two that we did:
the arctangent and the arcsine.",00:17:53.920,00:18:00.010
"So those are the ones
you're responsible for.",00:18:00.010,00:18:02.220
"You should have enough time,
anyway, to work out anything",00:18:02.220,00:18:06.970
"else, if you know these.",00:18:06.970,00:18:09.390
"All right, so
basically the idea is",00:18:09.390,00:18:11.210
"you have a bunch of
special formulas.",00:18:11.210,00:18:13.070
"You have a bunch of
general formulas.",00:18:13.070,00:18:14.820
"You put them
together, and you can",00:18:14.820,00:18:16.620
generate pretty much anything.,00:18:16.620,00:18:20.970
"Okay, so let's do a few
examples before going on",00:18:20.970,00:18:24.810
with the review.,00:18:24.810,00:18:41.290
"Okay, so I do want to do a few
examples in sort of increasing",00:18:41.290,00:18:48.230
"level of difficulty
in how you would",00:18:48.230,00:18:50.170
combine these things together.,00:18:50.170,00:18:51.420
"So first of all,
you should remember",00:18:51.420,00:18:55.980
"that if you differentiate the
secant function, that's just",00:18:55.980,00:19:00.885
"- oh I just realized that
I wanted to say something",00:19:00.885,00:19:03.780
else before - so forget that.,00:19:03.780,00:19:06.630
We'll do that in a second.,00:19:06.630,00:19:08.060
"I wanted to make
some general remarks.",00:19:08.060,00:19:10.980
"So there's one rule that you
discussed in my absence, which",00:19:10.980,00:19:17.600
is the chain rule.,00:19:17.600,00:19:19.070
"And I do want to make
just a couple of remarks",00:19:19.070,00:19:21.780
"about the chain rule now to
remind you of what it is,",00:19:21.780,00:19:26.160
"and also to present
some consequences.",00:19:26.160,00:19:30.160
"So, a little bit of
extra on the chain rule.",00:19:30.160,00:19:39.190
"The first thing that I want
say is that we didn't really",00:19:39.190,00:19:43.720
fully explain why it's true.,00:19:43.720,00:19:46.660
"And I do want to just
explain it by example, okay?",00:19:46.660,00:19:54.140
"So imagine that you have
a function which is, say,",00:19:54.140,00:19:59.720
10x + b.,00:19:59.720,00:20:02.000
All right?,00:20:02.000,00:20:02.500
So y = 10x + b.,00:20:02.500,00:20:04.980
"Then obviously, y is changing
10 times as fast as b, right?",00:20:04.980,00:20:09.970
"The issue is this number
here, dy/dx, is 10.",00:20:09.970,00:20:18.060
"And now if x is a
function of something,",00:20:18.060,00:20:20.460
"say t, shifted by some other
constant here, then dx/dt = 5.",00:20:20.460,00:20:34.290
"Now all the chain rule is saying
is that if y is going 10 times",00:20:34.290,00:20:38.800
"as fast as t, I'm sorry as
x, and x is going 5 times",00:20:38.800,00:20:44.610
"as fast as t, then y is
going 50 times as fast as t.",00:20:44.610,00:20:50.620
"And algebraically, all
this means is if I plug",00:20:50.620,00:20:53.530
"in and substitute, which is
what the composition of the two",00:20:53.530,00:20:57.100
"functions amounts to, 10(5t +
a) + b and I multiply it out,",00:20:57.100,00:21:04.760
I get 50t + 10a + b.,00:21:04.760,00:21:09.200
Now these terms don't matter.,00:21:09.200,00:21:11.697
The constant terms don't matter.,00:21:11.697,00:21:13.030
The rate is 50.,00:21:13.030,00:21:14.800
"And so the consequence,
if we put them together,",00:21:14.800,00:21:17.130
"is that dy/dt =
10*5, which is 50.",00:21:17.130,00:21:30.170
"All right, so this
is in a nutshell",00:21:30.170,00:21:31.990
why the chain rule works.,00:21:31.990,00:21:33.630
And why these rates multiply.,00:21:33.630,00:21:39.450
"The second thing that I wanted
to say about the chain rule",00:21:39.450,00:21:42.460
"is that it has a few
consequences that",00:21:42.460,00:21:45.050
"make some of the other
rules a little easier",00:21:45.050,00:21:47.380
"to remember or
possibly to avoid.",00:21:47.380,00:21:50.220
"The messiest rule
in my humble opinion",00:21:50.220,00:21:54.510
"is the quotient rule, which is
kind of a nuisance to remember.",00:21:54.510,00:21:59.430
"So let me just
remind you, if you",00:21:59.430,00:22:01.150
"take just the reciprocal
of a function,",00:22:01.150,00:22:03.840
"and you differentiate
it, there's",00:22:03.840,00:22:05.990
another way of looking at this.,00:22:05.990,00:22:08.170
"And it's actually
the way that I use,",00:22:08.170,00:22:09.720
"so I want to encourage you to
think about it this way too.",00:22:09.720,00:22:12.800
This is the same as (v^(-1))'.,00:22:12.800,00:22:15.670
.,00:22:15.670,00:22:16.700
"And now instead of using
the quotient rule, which",00:22:16.700,00:22:18.840
"we could've used, we can
use the chain rule here",00:22:18.840,00:22:23.840
"with the power -1, which
works by the power law.",00:22:23.840,00:22:29.720
So what is this equal to?,00:22:29.720,00:22:30.960
This is equal to -v^(-2) v'.,00:22:30.960,00:22:33.640
"So here, I've applied the
chain rule rather than",00:22:38.930,00:22:42.730
the quotient rule.,00:22:42.730,00:22:47.370
"And similarly, suppose I wanted
to derive the full quotient",00:22:47.370,00:22:54.060
rule.,00:22:54.060,00:22:54.560
"Well, now this may
or may not be easier.",00:22:54.560,00:22:57.240
"But this is one way of
remembering what's going on.",00:22:57.240,00:22:59.770
"If you convert it to uv^(-1)
and you differentiate that,",00:22:59.770,00:23:05.300
"now I can use the
product rule on this.",00:23:05.300,00:23:09.180
"Of course, I have to use
the chain rule and this rule",00:23:09.180,00:23:11.970
as well.,00:23:11.970,00:23:13.030
So what do I get?,00:23:13.030,00:23:15.620
"I get u', the inverse,
plus u, and then I have",00:23:15.620,00:23:21.519
to differentiate the v inverse.,00:23:21.519,00:23:22.810
"That's the formula
right up here.",00:23:22.810,00:23:24.490
That's -v^(-2) v'.,00:23:24.490,00:23:25.290
So that's one way of doing it.,00:23:30.300,00:23:33.230
"This actually explains
the funny minus sign",00:23:33.230,00:23:35.760
"when you differentiate
v in the formula.",00:23:35.760,00:23:38.560
"The other formula, the
other way that we did it,",00:23:38.560,00:23:41.280
"was by putting this over
a common denominator.",00:23:41.280,00:23:44.370
The common denominator was v^2.,00:23:44.370,00:23:49.330
This comes from this v v^(-2).,00:23:49.330,00:23:51.580
"And then the second
term is -uv'.",00:23:51.580,00:23:54.730
"And the first term, we have
to multiply by an extra factor",00:23:57.250,00:24:00.020
"of v, because we have a
v^2 in the denominator.",00:24:00.020,00:24:02.190
"So it's u'v. All right, so
this is the quotient rule as we",00:24:02.190,00:24:07.720
"wrote it down in lecture,
and this is just another way",00:24:07.720,00:24:11.247
"of remembering it or deriving
it without remembering it,",00:24:11.247,00:24:13.580
"if you just remember the chain
rule and the product rule.",00:24:13.580,00:24:16.700
"Okay, so you'll find
that in many contexts,",00:24:16.700,00:24:19.710
"it's easier to do
one or the other.",00:24:19.710,00:24:25.910
"Okay, so now I'm ready to
differentiate the secant",00:24:25.910,00:24:29.210
and a few such functions.,00:24:29.210,00:24:30.990
"So we'll do some
examples here here.",00:24:30.990,00:24:36.200
"So here's the secant
function, and I",00:24:36.200,00:24:39.030
"want to use that formula up
there for the reciprocal.",00:24:39.030,00:24:44.820
This is the way I think of it.,00:24:44.820,00:24:48.090
"This is the cosine
function to the power -1.",00:24:48.090,00:24:53.150
"And so, the formula
here is just what?",00:24:53.150,00:24:58.750
"It's just -(cos
x)^(-2) times -sin x.",00:24:58.750,00:25:04.030
"So now this is usually written
in a different fashion,",00:25:20.280,00:25:22.550
"so that's why I'm doing
this for a reason actually.",00:25:22.550,00:25:25.170
"Which is although there are
several formulas for things,",00:25:25.170,00:25:27.810
"with trig functions,
there are usually",00:25:27.810,00:25:29.810
five ways of writing something.,00:25:29.810,00:25:31.854
"So I'm writing this
one down so that you",00:25:31.854,00:25:33.520
"know what the standard
way of presenting it is.",00:25:33.520,00:25:36.780
"So what happens here is
that we have two minus signs",00:25:36.780,00:25:39.760
cancelling.,00:25:39.760,00:25:40.300
And we get sin x / cos^2 x.,00:25:40.300,00:25:44.360
"That's a perfectly
acceptable answer,",00:25:44.360,00:25:46.430
"but there's a customary
way in which is written.",00:25:46.430,00:25:49.470
"It's written (1 / cos
x) (sin x / cos x).",00:25:49.470,00:25:55.890
"And then we get rid
of the denominators",00:25:55.890,00:25:57.530
"by rewriting it in terms
of secant and tangent,",00:25:57.530,00:26:00.710
so sec x tan x.,00:26:00.710,00:26:04.100
"So this is the form
that's generally",00:26:04.100,00:26:07.680
"used when you see these
formulas written in textbooks.",00:26:07.680,00:26:11.790
"And so you know, you
need to watch out,",00:26:11.790,00:26:14.440
"because if you ever want to
use this kind of calculus,",00:26:14.440,00:26:16.810
"you'll have not be put off by
all the secants and tangents.",00:26:16.810,00:26:22.840
"All right, so getting
slightly more complicated,",00:26:22.840,00:26:26.830
"how about if we
differentiate ln(sec x)?",00:26:26.830,00:26:28.750
"If you differentiate
the natural log,",00:26:37.400,00:26:39.560
"that's just going to
be (sec x)' / sec x.",00:26:39.560,00:26:49.450
"And plugging in
the formula that we",00:26:49.450,00:26:51.250
"had before, that's sec x tan
x / sec x, which is tan x.",00:26:51.250,00:27:00.330
"So this one also has
a very nice form.",00:27:00.330,00:27:03.850
"And you might say that this
is kind of an ugly function,",00:27:03.850,00:27:07.940
"but the strange thing is that
the natural log was invented",00:27:07.940,00:27:14.120
"before the exponential by
a guy named Napier, exactly",00:27:14.120,00:27:19.030
"in order to evaluate
functions like this.",00:27:19.030,00:27:21.720
"These are the functions that
people cared about a lot,",00:27:21.720,00:27:25.930
"because they were
used in navigation.",00:27:25.930,00:27:28.890
"You wanted to multiply
sines and cosines together",00:27:28.890,00:27:32.640
to do navigation.,00:27:32.640,00:27:34.030
"And the multiplication he
encoded using a logarithm.",00:27:34.030,00:27:38.794
"So these were invented
long before people even",00:27:38.794,00:27:40.710
knew about exponents.,00:27:40.710,00:27:42.794
"And it was a surprise,
actually, that it",00:27:42.794,00:27:44.460
was connected to exponents.,00:27:44.460,00:27:46.100
"So the natural log was
invented before the log base 10",00:27:46.100,00:27:48.650
"and everything else, exactly
for this kind of purpose.",00:27:48.650,00:27:52.650
"Anyway, so this is
a nice function,",00:27:52.650,00:27:54.550
"which was very important,
so that your ships wouldn't",00:27:54.550,00:27:58.010
crash into the reef.,00:27:58.010,00:28:03.770
"Okay, let's continue here.",00:28:03.770,00:28:05.570
"So there's another
kind of function",00:28:05.570,00:28:08.870
that I want to discuss with you.,00:28:08.870,00:28:10.490
"And these are the
kinds in which there's",00:28:10.490,00:28:12.460
"a choice as to which of
these rules to apply.",00:28:12.460,00:28:19.380
"And I'll just give a
couple of examples of that.",00:28:19.380,00:28:25.130
"There usually is a
better and a worse way,",00:28:25.130,00:28:27.620
so let me illustrate that.,00:28:27.620,00:28:38.430
"Okay, yet another example.",00:28:38.430,00:28:41.120
"I hope you've seen
some of these before.",00:28:41.120,00:28:43.830
Say (x^10 + 8x)^6.,00:28:43.830,00:28:46.660
"So it's a little bit more
complicated than what",00:28:51.010,00:28:52.990
"we had before, because there
were several more symbols here.",00:28:52.990,00:29:00.330
"So what should we
do at this point?",00:29:00.330,00:29:03.210
"There's one choice which
I claim is a bad idea,",00:29:03.210,00:29:06.210
"and that is to expand
this out to the 6th power.",00:29:06.210,00:29:10.810
"That's a bad idea,
because it's very long.",00:29:10.810,00:29:13.530
"And then your answer
will also be very long.",00:29:13.530,00:29:15.990
"It will fill the entire
exam paper, for instance.",00:29:15.990,00:29:19.521
Yeah?,00:29:19.521,00:29:20.020
"STUDENT: Can you
use the chain rule?",00:29:20.020,00:29:21.380
PROFESSOR: Chain rule.,00:29:21.380,00:29:21.970
That's it.,00:29:21.970,00:29:22.580
We use the chain rule.,00:29:22.580,00:29:23.500
"So fortunately, this
is relatively easy",00:29:23.500,00:29:26.620
using the chain rule.,00:29:26.620,00:29:27.620
"We just think of this box
as being the function.",00:29:27.620,00:29:30.790
"And we take 6 times
this guy to the 5th,",00:29:30.790,00:29:34.560
"times the derivative of this
guy, which is 10x^9 + 8.",00:29:34.560,00:29:37.570
"And this is, filling
this in, it's x^10 + 8x.",00:29:41.500,00:29:43.910
And that's it.,00:29:43.910,00:29:46.140
"That's all you need to do
differentiate things like this.",00:29:46.140,00:29:50.270
"The chain rule is
very effective.",00:29:50.270,00:29:55.140
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:29:55.140,00:29:59.864
"PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.",00:29:59.864,00:30:01.280
"So I'm not really willing
to answer too many questions",00:30:01.280,00:30:04.330
"about what's going
to be on the exam.",00:30:04.330,00:30:07.500
"But the question
that was just asked",00:30:07.500,00:30:09.070
"is exactly the kind of question
I'm very happy to answer.",00:30:09.070,00:30:13.200
"Okay, the question was,
in what form is-- what",00:30:13.200,00:30:18.350
form is an acceptable answer?,00:30:18.350,00:30:20.090
"Now in real life, that is
a really serious question.",00:30:20.090,00:30:23.560
"When you ask a
computer a question",00:30:23.560,00:30:25.200
"and it gives you 500
million sheets of printout,",00:30:25.200,00:30:28.930
it's useless.,00:30:28.930,00:30:31.380
"And you really care what
form answers are in,",00:30:31.380,00:30:33.960
"and indeed, somebody
might really",00:30:33.960,00:30:35.730
"care what this thing
to the 6th power is,",00:30:35.730,00:30:39.000
"and then you would be forced
to discuss things in terms",00:30:39.000,00:30:42.090
of that other functional form.,00:30:42.090,00:30:46.110
"For the purposes of this
exam, this is okay form.",00:30:46.110,00:30:50.410
"And, in fact, any correct
form is an okay form.",00:30:50.410,00:30:54.490
"I recommend strongly that you
not try to simplify things",00:30:54.490,00:30:57.770

"Sometimes it will be to your
advantage to simplify things.",00:30:59.700,00:31:04.860
Sometimes we'll say simplify.,00:31:04.860,00:31:08.010

deal of experience",00:31:08.010,00:31:10.390
"to know when it's really worth
it to simplify expressions.",00:31:10.390,00:31:13.121
Yes?,00:31:13.121,00:31:13.620
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:31:13.620,00:31:19.530
"PROFESSOR: Right, so
turning to this example.",00:31:19.530,00:31:23.590
"The question is what
is this derivative?",00:31:23.590,00:31:25.520
And here's an answer.,00:31:25.520,00:31:27.240
That's the end of the problem.,00:31:27.240,00:31:29.500
This is a more customary form.,00:31:29.500,00:31:31.810
But this is answer is okay.,00:31:31.810,00:31:37.160
Same issue.,00:31:37.160,00:31:38.610
That's exactly the point.,00:31:38.610,00:31:40.970
Yes?,00:31:40.970,00:31:41.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:31:41.660,00:31:51.460
"PROFESSOR: The question is,
do you have to show the work?",00:31:51.460,00:31:59.032
Do you have to show the work?,00:31:59.032,00:32:00.240
"Well if I ask you
what is d/dx of sec x,",00:32:00.240,00:32:04.870
"then if you wrote
down this answer",00:32:04.870,00:32:06.650
"or you wrote down this
answer showing no work,",00:32:06.650,00:32:09.510
that would be acceptable.,00:32:09.510,00:32:11.200
"If the question was derive
the formula for this",00:32:11.200,00:32:15.950
"from the formula for the
derivative of the cosine",00:32:15.950,00:32:18.650
"or something like that, then
it would not be acceptable.",00:32:18.650,00:32:21.160
"You'd have to carry
out this arithmetic.",00:32:21.160,00:32:24.340
"So, in other words,
typically this",00:32:24.340,00:32:28.470
"will come up, for instance,
in various contexts.",00:32:28.470,00:32:32.290
"You just basically have
to follow directions.",00:32:32.290,00:32:34.830
Yes?,00:32:34.830,00:32:35.330
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:32:35.330,00:32:41.424
"PROFESSOR: The next
question is, are you",00:32:41.424,00:32:43.090
"expected to be
able to prove what",00:32:43.090,00:32:44.465
"the derivative of
the sine function is?",00:32:44.465,00:32:46.180
The short answer to that is yes.,00:32:46.180,00:32:49.580
"But I will be getting
to that when I discuss",00:32:49.580,00:32:51.630
the rest of the material here.,00:32:51.630,00:32:54.240
We're almost there.,00:32:54.240,00:32:58.430
"Okay, so let me just
finish these examples",00:32:58.430,00:33:02.640
with one last one.,00:33:02.640,00:33:04.880
"And then we'll talk
about this question",00:33:04.880,00:33:06.880
"of things like the derivative
of the sine function,",00:33:06.880,00:33:10.630
and deriving it.,00:33:10.630,00:33:12.060
"So the last example that I'd
like to write down is the one",00:33:12.060,00:33:15.620
"that I promised you
in the first lecture,",00:33:15.620,00:33:18.940
"namely to differentiate
e^(x tan^(-1) x).",00:33:18.940,00:33:26.172
"Basically you're supposed
to be able to differentiate",00:33:26.172,00:33:28.380
any function.,00:33:28.380,00:33:29.350
"So this is the one that we
mentioned at the beginning.",00:33:29.350,00:33:32.390
So here it is.,00:33:32.390,00:33:34.130
Let's do it.,00:33:34.130,00:33:37.280
So what is it?,00:33:37.280,00:33:38.170
"Well, it's just equal to
- I have to differentiate.",00:33:38.170,00:33:45.742
"I have to use the
chain rule - it's",00:33:45.742,00:33:47.200
"equal to the exponential
times the derivative",00:33:47.200,00:33:52.930
of this expression here.,00:33:52.930,00:33:58.200
That's the chain rule.,00:33:58.200,00:33:59.260
That's the first step.,00:33:59.260,00:34:01.700
"And now I have to apply
the product rule here.",00:34:01.700,00:34:06.440
So I have e^(x tan^(-1) x).,00:34:06.440,00:34:10.820
"And I differentiate the first
factor, so I get tan^(-1) x.",00:34:10.820,00:34:15.809
"Add to it what happens
when I differentiate",00:34:15.809,00:34:17.600
"the second factor,
leaving alone the x.",00:34:17.600,00:34:19.670
So that's x / (1+x^2).,00:34:19.670,00:34:21.450
And that's it.,00:34:24.310,00:34:26.300
That's the end of the problem.,00:34:26.300,00:34:28.780
It wasn't that hard.,00:34:28.780,00:34:30.590
"Of course, it requires you
to remember all of the rules,",00:34:30.590,00:34:35.330
"and a lot of formulas
underlying them.",00:34:35.330,00:34:37.300
"So that's consistent with
what I just told you.",00:34:37.300,00:34:39.560
"I told you that you
wanted to know this.",00:34:39.560,00:34:42.060
"I told you that you needed
to know this product rule,",00:34:42.060,00:34:44.740
"and that you needed to
know the chain rule.",00:34:44.740,00:34:50.419
"And I guess there
was one more thing,",00:34:50.419,00:34:51.960
"the derivative of e^x
came into play there.",00:34:51.960,00:34:55.260
"So of these formulas,
we used four of them",00:34:55.260,00:34:59.040
in this one calculation.,00:34:59.040,00:35:03.810
"Okay, so now what other things
did we talk about in Unit One?",00:35:03.810,00:35:15.880
"So the main other thing
that we talked about",00:35:15.880,00:35:23.590
"was the definition
of a derivative.",00:35:23.590,00:35:33.120
"And also there
was sort of a goal",00:35:33.120,00:35:40.020
"which was to get to the
meaning of the derivative.",00:35:40.020,00:35:51.050
"So these are things - so we
had a couple of ways of looking",00:35:51.050,00:35:56.520
"at it, or at least
a couple that I'm",00:35:56.520,00:35:59.170
going to emphasize right now.,00:35:59.170,00:36:01.780
"But first, let me remind
you what the formula is.",00:36:01.780,00:36:06.270
"The derivative is the limit
as delta x goes to 0 of (f(x +",00:36:06.270,00:36:13.900
delta x) - f(x)) / delta x.,00:36:13.900,00:36:19.040
"So that's it, and
this is certainly",00:36:19.040,00:36:22.430
"going to be a
central focus here.",00:36:22.430,00:36:25.640
"And you want to be able
to recognize this formula",00:36:25.640,00:36:29.600
in a number of ways.,00:36:29.600,00:36:42.760
"So, how do we use this?",00:36:42.760,00:36:44.520
"Well one thing we did
was we calculated a bunch",00:36:44.520,00:36:48.950
of these rates of change.,00:36:48.950,00:36:51.450
"In fact, more or less,
they're the ones which",00:36:51.450,00:36:53.580
are written right over here.,00:36:53.580,00:36:55.760
This list of functions here.,00:36:55.760,00:36:57.210
"Now, which ones did we
start out with just straight",00:36:57.210,00:37:01.470
from the definition here?,00:37:01.470,00:37:03.800
Which of these things?,00:37:03.800,00:37:04.840
"There were a whole
bunch of them.",00:37:04.840,00:37:06.215
"So we started out
with a function 1/x.",00:37:06.215,00:37:09.180
We did x^n.,00:37:09.180,00:37:11.530
We did sine x.,00:37:11.530,00:37:14.530
We did cosine x.,00:37:14.530,00:37:16.880
"Now there was a little
bit of subtlety with sine",00:37:16.880,00:37:19.205
x and cosine x.,00:37:19.205,00:37:21.110
"We got them using
something else.",00:37:21.110,00:37:25.210
"We didn't quite get
them all the way.",00:37:25.210,00:37:26.880
"We got them using
the case x = 0.",00:37:26.880,00:37:31.790
"We got them from the
derivative at x = 0,",00:37:31.790,00:37:34.530
"we got the formulas for the
derivatives of sine and cosine.",00:37:34.530,00:37:37.680
"But that was an argument
which involved plugging in sin",00:37:37.680,00:37:40.890
"(x + delta x), and
running through.",00:37:40.890,00:37:44.460
So that's one example.,00:37:44.460,00:37:45.840
We also did a^x.,00:37:45.840,00:37:50.630
And that may be it.,00:37:50.630,00:37:53.270
"Oh yeah, I think
that's about it.",00:37:53.270,00:37:58.350
That may be about it.,00:37:58.350,00:38:00.450
No.,00:38:00.450,00:38:00.950
It isn't.,00:38:00.950,00:38:01.620
"Okay, so let me make a
connection here which you",00:38:01.620,00:38:03.910
"probably haven't yet made, which
is that we did it for (u v)'.",00:38:03.910,00:38:07.770
And we also did it for (u / v)'.,00:38:10.520,00:38:15.690
"So sorry, I shouldn't
write primes,",00:38:15.690,00:38:17.460
"because that's not consistent
with the claim there.",00:38:17.460,00:38:20.500
"I differentiated the product;
I differentiated the quotient",00:38:20.500,00:38:24.900
using the same delta x notation.,00:38:24.900,00:38:28.110
"I guess I forgot that because I
wasn't there when it happened.",00:38:28.110,00:38:32.760
"So look, these are the
ones that you do by this.",00:38:32.760,00:38:36.550
"And, of course, you might have
to reduce them to other things.",00:38:36.550,00:38:39.310
"These involve using
something else.",00:38:39.310,00:38:42.190
"This one involves using the
slope of this function at 0,",00:38:42.190,00:38:46.610
"just the way the sine
and the cosine did.",00:38:46.610,00:38:48.600
"This one involves the slopes
of the individual functions, u",00:38:48.600,00:38:52.410
"and v. And this one also
involves the individual--",00:38:52.410,00:38:54.827
"So, in other words,
it doesn't get you",00:38:54.827,00:38:56.410
"all the way through
to the end, but it's",00:38:56.410,00:38:58.390
"expressed in terms of something
simpler in each of these cases.",00:38:58.390,00:39:03.010
And I could go on.,00:39:03.010,00:39:05.840
"We didn't do these in class,
but you're certainly--",00:39:05.840,00:39:09.280
"e^x is a perfectly okay
one on one of the exams.",00:39:09.280,00:39:12.170
We ask you for 1/x^2.,00:39:12.170,00:39:14.561
"In other words, I'm
not claiming that it's",00:39:14.561,00:39:16.310
"going to be one on this
list, but it certainly",00:39:16.310,00:39:18.380
can be any one of these.,00:39:18.380,00:39:19.671
"But we're not going
to ask you to go",00:39:19.671,00:39:21.170
"all the way through to the
beginning in these formulas.",00:39:21.170,00:39:26.380
"There are also some fundamental
limits that I certainly",00:39:26.380,00:39:28.940
want you to know about.,00:39:28.940,00:39:31.210
"And these you can
derive in reverse.",00:39:31.210,00:39:34.680
So I will describe that now.,00:39:34.680,00:39:58.880
"So let me also emphasize
the following thing: I want",00:39:58.880,00:40:06.800
to read this backwards now.,00:40:06.800,00:40:18.590
"This is the theme from the
very beginning of this lecture.",00:40:18.590,00:40:21.370
"Namely, if you're
given the function f,",00:40:21.370,00:40:25.210
"you can figure out its
derivative by this formula",00:40:25.210,00:40:27.811
here.,00:40:27.811,00:40:28.310
"That is the formula for
this in terms of what's",00:40:28.310,00:40:29.860
on the right hand side.,00:40:29.860,00:40:30.920
"On the other hand,
you can also use",00:40:30.920,00:40:34.400
"the formula in that
direction, and if you",00:40:34.400,00:40:45.280
"know the slope of something,
you can figure out",00:40:45.280,00:40:48.310
what the limit is.,00:40:48.310,00:40:49.170
"For example, I'll use
the letter x here,",00:40:49.170,00:40:54.570
even though it's cheating.,00:40:54.570,00:40:56.040
"Maybe I'll call it delta
x so it's clearer to you.",00:40:56.040,00:40:59.530
Maybe I'll call it u.,00:40:59.530,00:41:06.900
"Suppose you look
at this limit here.",00:41:06.900,00:41:10.370
"Well, I claim that you
should recognize that is",00:41:10.370,00:41:14.800
"the derivative with respect to
u of the function e^u at u = 0,",00:41:14.800,00:41:19.870
which of course we know to be 1.,00:41:19.870,00:41:22.660
"So this is reading this
formula in reverse.",00:41:22.660,00:41:25.420
"It's recognizing that
one of these limits -",00:41:25.420,00:41:27.940
"let me rewrite this again
here - one of these so-called",00:41:27.940,00:41:35.160
"difference quotient
limits is a derivative.",00:41:35.160,00:41:39.390
"And since we know a formula
for that derivative,",00:41:39.390,00:41:42.190
we can evaluate it.,00:41:42.190,00:41:49.940
"And lastly, there's
one other type of thing",00:41:49.940,00:41:54.150
which I think you should know.,00:41:54.150,00:41:57.550
"These are the ones you do
with difference quotients.",00:41:57.550,00:41:59.767
"There are also other
formulas that you",00:41:59.767,00:42:01.350
want to be able to derive.,00:42:01.350,00:42:03.000
"You want to be able
to derive formulas",00:42:03.000,00:42:19.740
by implicit differentiation.,00:42:19.740,00:42:27.670
"In other words,
the basic idea is",00:42:27.670,00:42:30.220
"to take whatever
equation you've got",00:42:30.220,00:42:32.150
"and simplify it as
much as possible,",00:42:32.150,00:42:36.560
"without insisting
that you solve for y.",00:42:36.560,00:42:41.260
"That's not necessarily
the most appropriate way",00:42:41.260,00:42:44.080
to get the rate of change.,00:42:44.080,00:42:45.630
"The much simpler
formula is sin y = x.",00:42:45.630,00:42:51.910
"And that one is easier to
differentiate implicitly.",00:42:51.910,00:42:59.780
"So I should say, do
this kind of thing.",00:42:59.780,00:43:02.900
"So that's, if you like,
a typical derivation",00:43:02.900,00:43:05.550
that you might see.,00:43:05.550,00:43:08.390
"And then there's one last type
of problem that you'll face,",00:43:08.390,00:43:13.070
"and it's the other thing
that I claim we discussed.",00:43:13.070,00:43:21.590
"And it goes all the way
back to the first lecture.",00:43:21.590,00:43:26.580
"So the last thing that we'll be
talking about is tangent lines.",00:43:26.580,00:43:33.700
All right?,00:43:33.700,00:43:34.200
"The geometric point of
view of a derivative.",00:43:34.200,00:43:38.760
"And we'll be doing more
of this in next the unit.",00:43:38.760,00:43:41.900
"So first of all,
you'll be expected",00:43:41.900,00:43:44.850
"to be able to compute
the tangent line.",00:43:44.850,00:43:52.380
"That's often fairly
straightforward.",00:43:52.380,00:43:56.400
"And the second thing
is to graph y' ,",00:43:56.400,00:44:03.100
the derivative of a function.,00:44:03.100,00:44:07.370
"And the third thing,
which I'm going",00:44:07.370,00:44:09.350
"to throw in here,
because I regard it",00:44:09.350,00:44:11.550
"in a sort of geometric
vein, although it's got",00:44:11.550,00:44:14.900
an analytical aspect to it.,00:44:14.900,00:44:16.690
So this is a picture.,00:44:16.690,00:44:18.870
This is a computation.,00:44:18.870,00:44:20.710
"And if you combine
the two together,",00:44:20.710,00:44:23.080
you get something else.,00:44:23.080,00:44:24.270
"And so this is to recognize
differentiable functions.",00:44:24.270,00:44:37.870
"Alright, so how do you do this?",00:44:37.870,00:44:40.190
"Well, we really only
have one way of doing it.",00:44:40.190,00:44:43.600
"We're going to check the
left and right tangents.",00:44:43.600,00:44:54.580
They must be equal.,00:44:54.580,00:44:59.450
"So again, this is
a property that you",00:44:59.450,00:45:04.280
"should be familiar with
from some of your exercises.",00:45:04.280,00:45:06.830
"And the idea is simply, that
if the tangent line exists,",00:45:06.830,00:45:09.660
"it's the same from the
right and from the left.",00:45:09.660,00:45:14.770
"Okay, now I'm going to
just do one example here",00:45:14.770,00:45:20.200
"from this sort of
qualitative sketching skill",00:45:20.200,00:45:25.450
to give you an example here.,00:45:25.450,00:45:27.289
"And what I'm going
to do is I'm going",00:45:27.289,00:45:28.830
"to draw a graph of a
function like this.",00:45:28.830,00:45:34.750
"And what I want to
do underneath is draw",00:45:34.750,00:45:38.490
the graph of the derivative.,00:45:38.490,00:45:41.600
"So this is the
function y = f(x),",00:45:41.600,00:45:45.900
"and here I'm going to draw
the graph of the function y =",00:45:45.900,00:45:48.350
f'(x) right underneath it.,00:45:48.350,00:45:56.490
"So now, let's think about what
it's supposed to look like.",00:45:56.490,00:46:00.330
"And the one step that you need
to make in order to do this,",00:46:00.330,00:46:05.840
is to draw a few tangent lines.,00:46:05.840,00:46:08.660
"I'm just going to
draw one down here.",00:46:08.660,00:46:13.210
"And I'm going to
draw one up here.",00:46:13.210,00:46:18.730
"Now, the tangent
lines here - notice",00:46:18.730,00:46:22.740
"that the slope of these
tangent lines are all positive.",00:46:22.740,00:46:27.266
"So everything I
draw down here is",00:46:27.266,00:46:28.640
going to be above the x-axis.,00:46:28.640,00:46:33.880
"Furthermore, as I go
further to the left,",00:46:33.880,00:46:36.190
they get steeper and steeper.,00:46:36.190,00:46:37.830
"So they're getting
higher and higher.",00:46:37.830,00:46:39.500
"So the function is
coming down like this.",00:46:39.500,00:46:44.020
It starts up there.,00:46:44.020,00:46:45.350
"Maybe I'll draw it in green
to illustrate the graph here.",00:46:45.350,00:46:50.570
So that's this function here.,00:46:50.570,00:46:56.910
"As we get farther out, it's
getting flatter and flatter.",00:46:56.910,00:46:59.750
"So it's leveling off, but
above the axis like that.",00:46:59.750,00:47:06.270
"So one of the
things to emphasize",00:47:06.270,00:47:08.280
"is, you should not
expect the derivative",00:47:08.280,00:47:10.830
to look like the function.,00:47:10.830,00:47:12.090
It's totally different.,00:47:12.090,00:47:13.320
"It's keeping track at each
point of its tangent line.",00:47:13.320,00:47:17.280
"On the other hand, you should
get some kind of physical feel",00:47:17.280,00:47:19.780
"for it, and we'll be practicing
this more in the next unit.",00:47:19.780,00:47:23.619
"So let me give you an
example of a function which",00:47:23.619,00:47:25.660
does exactly this.,00:47:25.660,00:47:27.800
And it's the function y = ln x.,00:47:27.800,00:47:33.240
"If you differentiate
it, you get y' = 1/x.",00:47:33.240,00:47:38.560
"And this plot above is, roughly
speaking, the logarithm.",00:47:38.560,00:47:44.630
"And this plot underneath
is the function 1/x.",00:47:44.630,00:47:50.230
"We still have time
for one question.",00:47:50.230,00:47:53.230
"And so, fire away.",00:47:53.230,00:47:58.580
Yes?,00:47:58.580,00:48:03.207
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:48:03.207,00:48:04.040
"PROFESSOR: The
question is, can you",00:48:04.040,00:48:05.580
"show how you derive the
inverse tangent of x.",00:48:05.580,00:48:09.770
So that's in a lecture.,00:48:09.770,00:48:13.350
"I'm happy to do it right
now, but it's going",00:48:13.350,00:48:17.060
to take me a whole two minutes.,00:48:17.060,00:48:20.420
"So, here's how you do
it. y = tan^(-1) x.",00:48:20.420,00:48:27.560
"And now this is hopeless
to differentiate,",00:48:27.560,00:48:30.230
so I rewrite it as tan y = x.,00:48:30.230,00:48:34.720
"And now I have to
differentiate that.",00:48:34.720,00:48:38.440
"So when I
differentiate it, I get",00:48:38.440,00:48:42.360
"the derivative of
tan y with respect",00:48:42.360,00:48:44.260
to x-- with respect to y.,00:48:44.260,00:48:46.560
That's 1 / (1 + y^2) times y'.,00:48:46.560,00:48:48.210
So this is a hard step.,00:48:51.120,00:48:52.850
That's the chain rule.,00:48:52.850,00:48:53.930
And on the left side I get 1.,00:48:53.930,00:48:55.860
"So I'm doing this
super fast because we",00:48:55.860,00:48:57.650
have thirty seconds left.,00:48:57.650,00:49:00.720
"But this is the hard
step right here.",00:49:00.720,00:49:02.840
"And it needs for you
to know that d/dy tan",00:49:02.840,00:49:04.900
"y is equal to one over-- Oh,
bad bad bad, secant squared.",00:49:04.900,00:49:14.432
I was ahead of myself so fast.,00:49:14.432,00:49:22.810
So here's the identity.,00:49:22.810,00:49:24.920
"So you need have
known this in advance.",00:49:24.920,00:49:28.500
"And that's the input
into this equation.",00:49:28.500,00:49:30.740
"So now, what we have is
that y' = 1 / sec^2 y y,",00:49:30.740,00:49:44.000
"which is the same
thing as cos^2 y.",00:49:44.000,00:49:51.380
"Now, the last bit
of the problem is",00:49:51.380,00:49:54.170
to rewrite this in terms of x.,00:49:54.170,00:49:57.930
"And that you have to do
with a right triangle.",00:49:57.930,00:50:02.664
"If this is x and this
is 1, then the angle",00:50:02.664,00:50:05.618
"is y, because the
tangent of y is x.",00:50:05.618,00:50:09.416
"So this expresses the fact
that the tangent of y is x.",00:50:09.416,00:50:14.902
"And then the hypotenuse is
the square root of 1 + x^2.",00:50:14.902,00:50:18.700
"And so the cosine is
1 divided by that.",00:50:21.654,00:50:27.140
"So this thing is 1 divided by
the square root of 1 + x^2,",00:50:27.140,00:50:30.938
the quantity squared.,00:50:30.938,00:50:36.424
"So, and then the last little bit
here, since I'm racing along,",00:50:36.424,00:50:40.644
"is that it's 1 / (1 + x^2),
which I incorrectly wrote over",00:50:40.644,00:50:45.286
here.,00:50:45.286,00:50:46.130
"Okay, so good luck on the test.",00:50:46.130,00:50:48.662
See you tomorrow.,00:50:48.662,00:50:50.756
