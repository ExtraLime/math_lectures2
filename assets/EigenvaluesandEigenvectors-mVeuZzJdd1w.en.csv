PROFESSOR: Hi guys.,00:00:07.110,00:00:08.540
"Today, we are going
to play around",00:00:08.540,00:00:10.700
"with the basics of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.",00:00:10.700,00:00:14.040
"We're going to do the
following problem,",00:00:14.040,00:00:16.940
"we're given this
invertible matrix A,",00:00:16.940,00:00:20.450
"and we'll find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors",00:00:20.450,00:00:24.350
"not of A, but of A squared and
A inverse minus the identity.",00:00:24.350,00:00:33.630
"So, this problem might seem
daunting at first, squaring a 3",00:00:33.630,00:00:40.250
"by 3 matrix, or taking an
inverse of a 3 by 3 matrix",00:00:40.250,00:00:44.690
"is a fairly computationally
intensive task,",00:00:44.690,00:00:49.880
"but if you've seen
Professor Strang's lecture",00:00:49.880,00:00:52.530
"on eigenvalues and
eigenvectors you",00:00:52.530,00:00:54.540
shouldn't be all too worried.,00:00:54.540,00:00:55.910
"So I'll give you a
few moments to think",00:00:55.910,00:00:59.440
"of your own line of attack
and then you'll see mine.",00:00:59.440,00:01:02.650
"Hi again, OK, so the observation
that makes our life really easy",00:01:11.120,00:01:19.160
is the following one.,00:01:19.160,00:01:20.480
"So say v is an eigenvector with
associated eigenvalue lambda",00:01:20.480,00:01:28.170
"to the matrix A. Then, if we
hit v with A squared, well,",00:01:28.170,00:01:39.070
"this we can write it as A
times A*v, but A*v is lambda*v,",00:01:39.070,00:01:45.621
right?,00:01:45.621,00:01:46.120
So we have A*lambda*v.,00:01:46.120,00:01:50.150
"Lambda is a scalar, so we
can move it in front and get",00:01:50.150,00:01:55.965
"lambda*A*v, and lambda*A*v is,
when we plug in A*v, lambda*v,",00:01:55.965,00:02:03.670
"is just lambda squared v. So,
what we've find out is that",00:02:03.670,00:02:10.235
"if v is an eigenvector for A
then it's also an eigenvector",00:02:10.235,00:02:14.370
for A squared.,00:02:14.370,00:02:15.450
"Just that the eigenvalue
is the eigenvalue squared.",00:02:15.450,00:02:19.840
"Similarly, if we hit A inverse--
if you hit v with A inverse.",00:02:19.840,00:02:28.070
"So in this case we can
write v as A*v over lambda,",00:02:28.070,00:02:36.760
"given that of course,
lambda is non-zero.",00:02:36.760,00:02:41.150
"But the eigenvalues of
an invertible matrix",00:02:41.150,00:02:45.870
"are always non-zero,
which is an exercise",00:02:45.870,00:02:50.065
you should do yourselves.,00:02:50.065,00:02:52.560
"So if we just,
then, take out the A",00:02:52.560,00:03:00.210
"and combine it with A
inverse, this is the identity,",00:03:00.210,00:03:06.830
"and so we get 1
over lambda v. So v",00:03:06.830,00:03:11.210
"is also an eigenvector
for a inverse,",00:03:11.210,00:03:14.020
"with eigenvalue the
reciprocal of lambda.",00:03:14.020,00:03:19.060
"OK, and from here, of course,
A inverse minus the identity",00:03:19.060,00:03:25.350
"is lambda inverse minus
1 v, so the eigenvalue",00:03:25.350,00:03:38.640
"of A inverse minus the identity
is 1 over lambda minus 1.",00:03:38.640,00:03:44.920
"OK, so, what we've
figured out is:",00:03:44.920,00:03:50.120
"we just need to find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors",00:03:50.120,00:03:53.340
"of A and then we have a way of
finding what the eigenvalues",00:03:53.340,00:03:58.350
"and eigenvectors of A
squared and A inverse",00:03:58.350,00:04:03.740
minus the identity will be.,00:04:03.740,00:04:05.290
"OK so, how do we
find the eigenvalues?",00:04:05.290,00:04:11.570
"Well, what does
it mean for lambda",00:04:11.570,00:04:17.089
to be an eigenvalue of A?,00:04:17.089,00:04:19.180
"It means that the matrix A
minus lambda the identity",00:04:19.180,00:04:22.355
"is singular, which is
precisely the case when",00:04:22.355,00:04:28.500
"its determinant is 0, OK?",00:04:28.500,00:04:35.220
"So we need to solve
the following equation:",00:04:35.220,00:04:49.760
"1 minus lambda, 2, 3; 0, 1
minus lambda, -2; and 0, 1,",00:04:49.760,00:05:06.230
4 minus lambda.,00:05:06.230,00:05:08.420
"OK, it's fairly obvious
which column we should",00:05:08.420,00:05:17.050
use to expand this determinant.,00:05:17.050,00:05:20.190
"We should use the first
column, because we",00:05:20.190,00:05:22.490
"have only one non-zero
entry, and so this",00:05:22.490,00:05:26.800
"is equal to 1 minus lambda
times the determinant of the two",00:05:26.800,00:05:36.000
"by two matrix 1 minus
lambda, -2; 1, 4",00:05:36.000,00:05:45.050
"minus lambda, which is, I'm
going to do the computation up",00:05:45.050,00:05:51.090
here.,00:05:51.090,00:05:51.590
"1 minus lambda, lambda
squared minus 5 lambda plus 6.",00:05:57.740,00:06:08.260
"Which is a fairly
familiar quadratic,",00:06:08.260,00:06:11.580
"and we can write it as the
product of linear factors,",00:06:11.580,00:06:18.140
"as lambda minus 2,
lambda minus three.",00:06:18.140,00:06:23.230
"So the three eigenvalues
of A are 1, 2, and 3.",00:06:23.230,00:06:33.000
"OK so, first half of
our problem is done,",00:06:33.000,00:06:37.990
"now we just need to find what
the eigenvectors associated",00:06:37.990,00:06:41.830
"with each of these
eigenvalues are.",00:06:41.830,00:06:44.740
How we do that?,00:06:44.740,00:06:46.690
"Well, let's see.",00:06:46.690,00:06:51.562
"Let's figure out what the
eigenvector associated",00:06:51.562,00:06:54.960
with lambda equals 1 is.,00:06:54.960,00:06:56.380
"So, we know that the
eigenvector needs",00:06:59.260,00:07:01.610
"to be in the null
space of A minus lambda",00:07:01.610,00:07:05.990
"the identity, so A
minus the identity, v,",00:07:05.990,00:07:13.270
"so-- write this out-- it's,
0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0, -2, 0, 1.",00:07:13.270,00:07:37.740
"And we see that the
first column is 0,",00:07:37.740,00:07:40.130
"so the first variable
will be our free variable",00:07:40.130,00:07:52.630
"if we want to solve this
linear system of equations.",00:07:52.630,00:07:54.840
"And you can just set
it to 1 and it's not",00:07:57.360,00:08:01.970
"hard to see that the other
two entries should be 0.",00:08:01.970,00:08:09.950
"So we can do the same procedure
with the other two eigenvalues",00:08:09.950,00:08:14.930
"and we'll get an eigenvector
for each eigenvalue.",00:08:14.930,00:08:24.540
"And in the end--
let me go back here.",00:08:24.540,00:08:27.280
"So I'm going to put our
results in a little table.",00:08:30.100,00:08:36.010
"So A squared, inverse minus
the identity, so the first row",00:08:36.010,00:08:46.830
will be eigenvalues.,00:08:46.830,00:08:48.560
"So it's going to be: if
lambda is an eigenvalue for A,",00:08:54.920,00:08:59.800
"then we saw that
lambda squared will",00:08:59.800,00:09:02.150
"be the eigenvalue for A squared
and lambda inverse minus 1",00:09:02.150,00:09:08.250
"will be the eigenvalue for A
inverse minus the identity.",00:09:08.250,00:09:11.940
"And the eigenvectors
will be the same.",00:09:11.940,00:09:19.630
"OK, we're done.",00:09:19.630,00:09:21.483
