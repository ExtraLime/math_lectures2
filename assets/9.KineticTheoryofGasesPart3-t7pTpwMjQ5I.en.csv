at ocw.mit.edu.,00:00:17.217,00:00:17.842
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:00:20.540,00:00:21.840
Let's start.,00:00:21.840,00:00:22.463
"So last time, we started
with kinetic theory.",00:00:26.420,00:00:30.000
"And we will focus for
gas systems mostly.",00:00:36.120,00:00:39.205
"And the question
that we would like",00:00:43.890,00:00:45.730
"to think about and answer
somehow is the following.",00:00:45.730,00:00:50.140
"You start with a gas
that is initially",00:00:50.140,00:00:56.260
confined to one chamber.,00:00:56.260,00:00:57.765
"And you can calculate all of
its thermodynamic properties.",00:01:01.400,00:01:06.180
"You open at time 0 a
hole, allowing the gas",00:01:06.180,00:01:11.560
"to escape into a second
initially empty chamber.",00:01:11.560,00:01:17.290
"And after some time,
the whole system",00:01:17.290,00:01:19.400
"will come to a new
equilibrium position.",00:01:19.400,00:01:22.320
It's a pretty reversible thing.,00:01:22.320,00:01:25.040
"You can do this experiment
many, many times.",00:01:25.040,00:01:27.620
"And you will always get
roughly the same amount of time",00:01:27.620,00:01:31.690
"for the situation to
start from one equilibrium",00:01:31.690,00:01:34.280
and reach another equilibrium.,00:01:34.280,00:01:36.820
So how do we describe that?,00:01:36.820,00:01:38.250
"It's slightly beyond what
we did in thermodynamics,",00:01:38.250,00:01:41.010
"because we want to go
from one equilibrium state",00:01:41.010,00:01:43.990
to another equilibrium state.,00:01:43.990,00:01:46.910
"Now, we said, OK, we know
the equations of motion",00:01:46.910,00:01:50.260
"that governs the particles
that are described by this.",00:01:50.260,00:01:55.200
"So here we can say that we
have, let's say, N particles.",00:01:55.200,00:02:00.970
"They have their own
momenta and coordinates.",00:02:00.970,00:02:05.930
"And we know that these
momenta and coordinates evolve",00:02:05.930,00:02:09.160
"in time, governed
by some Hamiltonian,",00:02:09.160,00:02:12.230
"which is a function of all of
these momenta and coordinates.",00:02:12.230,00:02:17.290
OK?,00:02:17.290,00:02:17.880
Fine.,00:02:17.880,00:02:19.270
"How do we go from
a situation which",00:02:19.270,00:02:21.400
"describes a whole
bunch of things",00:02:21.400,00:02:23.100
"and coordinates that
are changing with time",00:02:23.100,00:02:25.580
"to some microscopic description
of macroscopic variables going",00:02:25.580,00:02:33.400
"from one equilibrium
state to another?",00:02:33.400,00:02:36.850
"So our first attempt
in that direction",00:02:36.850,00:02:39.740
"was to say, well, I could start
with many, many, many examples",00:02:39.740,00:02:46.390
of the same situation.,00:02:46.390,00:02:49.260
"Each one of them would
correspond to a different",00:02:49.260,00:02:52.190
trajectory of p's and q's.,00:02:52.190,00:02:55.500
"And so what we can
do is to construct",00:02:55.500,00:02:59.300
"some kind of an ensemble
average, or ensemble density,",00:02:59.300,00:03:05.720
"first, which is what we did.",00:03:05.720,00:03:08.800
"We can say that the very, very
many examples of this situation",00:03:08.800,00:03:15.255
"that I can have will
correspond to different points",00:03:15.255,00:03:20.300
"at some particular
instant of time,",00:03:20.300,00:03:23.890
"occupying this
6N-dimensional phase space,",00:03:23.890,00:03:28.085
"out of which I can construct
some kind of a density in phase",00:03:28.085,00:03:32.330
space.,00:03:32.330,00:03:34.950
"But then I realize that since
each one of these trajectories",00:03:34.950,00:03:39.320
"is evolving according
to this Hamiltonian,",00:03:39.320,00:03:42.490
"this density could potentially
be a function of time.",00:03:42.490,00:03:45.320
"And we described the
equation for the evolution",00:03:48.030,00:03:52.710
of that density with time.,00:03:52.710,00:03:54.850
"And we could write it in
this form-- V rho by dt",00:03:54.850,00:03:59.980
"is the Poisson bracket of
the Hamiltonian with rho.",00:03:59.980,00:04:05.350
"And this Poisson
bracket was defined",00:04:05.350,00:04:10.120
"as a sum over all
of your coordinates.",00:04:10.120,00:04:13.650
Oops.,00:04:16.339,00:04:16.839
"We had d rho by d vector qi,
dot product with dH by dpi minus",00:04:22.490,00:04:34.660
the other [? way. ?],00:04:34.660,00:04:36.116
"So there are essentially
three N terms-- well,",00:04:42.470,00:04:47.740
"actually, six N terms, but three
N pairs of terms in this sum.",00:04:47.740,00:04:52.920
"I can either use
some index alpha",00:04:52.920,00:04:55.890
"running from one to
three N, or indicate them",00:04:55.890,00:04:59.460
"as contributions of things that
come from individual particles",00:04:59.460,00:05:05.100
"and then use this notation
with three vectors.",00:05:05.100,00:05:08.210
"So this is essentially
a combination",00:05:08.210,00:05:11.280
of sum of three terms.,00:05:11.280,00:05:14.440
OK?,00:05:14.440,00:05:16.900
"So I hope that
somehow this equation",00:05:16.900,00:05:22.910
"can describe the evolution
that goes on over here.",00:05:22.910,00:05:28.420
"And ultimately, when I wait
sufficiently long time,",00:05:28.420,00:05:32.660
"I will reach a situation
where d rho by dt",00:05:32.660,00:05:36.910
does not change anymore.,00:05:36.910,00:05:39.455
"And I will find some density
that is invariant on time.",00:05:39.455,00:05:43.830
I'll call that rho equilibrium.,00:05:43.830,00:05:46.650
"And so we saw that we could have
our rho equilibrium, which then",00:05:46.650,00:05:51.810
"should have zero Poisson bracket
with H to be a function of H",00:05:51.810,00:05:58.620
"and any other
conserved quantity.",00:05:58.620,00:06:00.140
OK?,00:06:05.900,00:06:08.780
"So in principle,
we sort of thought",00:06:08.780,00:06:14.582
"of a way of describing
how the system will evolve",00:06:14.582,00:06:21.030
"in equilibrium--
towards an equilibrium.",00:06:21.030,00:06:24.660
"And indeed, we will find that in
statistical mechanics later on,",00:06:24.660,00:06:30.290
"we are going to rely heavily
on these descriptions",00:06:30.290,00:06:35.340
"of equilibrium
densities, which are",00:06:35.340,00:06:38.370
"governed by only
the Hamiltonian.",00:06:38.370,00:06:41.090
"And if there are any other
conserved quantities,",00:06:41.090,00:06:43.850
typically there are not.,00:06:43.850,00:06:45.150
"So this is the general
form that we'll ultimately",00:06:45.150,00:06:49.650
be using a lot.,00:06:49.650,00:06:52.630
"But we started
with a description",00:06:52.630,00:06:56.730
"of evolution of
these coordinates",00:06:56.730,00:06:58.820
"in time, which is
time-reversible.",00:06:58.820,00:07:01.420
"And we hope to end up
with a situation that",00:07:05.870,00:07:08.835
"is analogous to what we
describe thermodynamically,",00:07:08.835,00:07:12.180
"we describe something that
goes to some particular state,",00:07:12.180,00:07:18.410
"and basically
stays there, as far",00:07:18.410,00:07:20.230
"as the macroscopic
description is concerned.",00:07:20.230,00:07:23.620
"So did we somehow manage to just
look at something else, which",00:07:23.620,00:07:29.550
"is this density, and
achieve this transition",00:07:29.550,00:07:32.470
"from reversibility
to irreversibility?",00:07:32.470,00:07:35.520
And the answer is no.,00:07:35.520,00:07:36.760
"This equation-- also,
if you find, indeed,",00:07:36.760,00:07:40.610
"a rho that goes from here to
here, you can set t to minus t",00:07:40.610,00:07:47.230
"and get a rho that goes
from back here to here.",00:07:47.230,00:07:49.705
"It has the same
time-reversibility.",00:07:49.705,00:07:52.500
"So somehow, we have to
find another solution.",00:07:52.500,00:07:56.400
"And the solution that we
will gradually build upon",00:07:56.400,00:08:00.180
"relies more on
physics rather than",00:08:00.180,00:08:03.150
"the rigorous mathematical
nature of this thing.",00:08:03.150,00:08:06.850
"Physically, we know
that this happens.",00:08:06.850,00:08:09.310
All of us have seen this.,00:08:09.310,00:08:11.560
"So somehow, we should be able
to use physical approximation",00:08:11.560,00:08:16.026
"and assumptions that
are compatible with what",00:08:16.026,00:08:18.860
is observed.,00:08:18.860,00:08:20.260
"And if, during that,
we have to sort of make",00:08:20.260,00:08:24.280
"mathematical
approximations, so be it.",00:08:24.280,00:08:27.450
"In fact, we have to make
mathematical approximations,",00:08:27.450,00:08:30.330
"because otherwise, there is
this very strong reversibility",00:08:30.330,00:08:35.620
condition.,00:08:35.620,00:08:37.000
"So let's see how we are about
to proceed, thinking more",00:08:37.000,00:08:41.030
in terms of physics.,00:08:41.030,00:08:43.820
"Now, the information
that I have over here,",00:08:43.820,00:08:47.840
"either in this
description of ensemble",00:08:47.840,00:08:50.335
"or in this description
in terms of trajectories,",00:08:50.335,00:08:53.220
is just enormous.,00:08:53.220,00:08:55.960
"I can't think of any
physical process which",00:08:55.960,00:09:01.090
"would need to keep track of the
joined positions of coordinates",00:09:01.090,00:09:05.990
"and momenta of 10
to the 23 particles,",00:09:05.990,00:09:08.900
"and know them with infinite
precision, et cetera.",00:09:08.900,00:09:13.190
"Things that I make
observations with",00:09:13.190,00:09:15.280
"and I say, we see this,
well, what do we see?",00:09:15.280,00:09:18.790
"We see that something has some
kind of a density over here.",00:09:18.790,00:09:24.090
It has some kind of pressure.,00:09:24.090,00:09:26.010
"Maybe there is, in the
middle of this process,",00:09:26.010,00:09:28.720
some flow of gas particles.,00:09:28.720,00:09:30.530
"We can talk about the
velocity of those things.",00:09:30.530,00:09:33.420
"And let's say even
when we are sort",00:09:33.420,00:09:35.130
"of being very non-equilibrium
and thinking about velocity",00:09:35.130,00:09:39.460
"of those particles going from
one side to the other side,",00:09:39.460,00:09:43.550
"we really don't care which
particle among the 10 to the 23",00:09:43.550,00:09:48.060
"is at some instant
of time contributing",00:09:48.060,00:09:50.520
"to the velocity of the
gas that is swishing past.",00:09:50.520,00:09:55.130
"So clearly, any physical
observable that we make",00:09:55.130,00:09:59.720
"is something that
does not require",00:09:59.720,00:10:03.780
all of those degrees of freedom.,00:10:03.780,00:10:05.890
"So let's just construct
some of those things",00:10:05.890,00:10:08.060
"that we may find
useful and see how",00:10:08.060,00:10:10.480
"we would describe
evolutions of them.",00:10:10.480,00:10:13.170
"I mean, the most useful
thing, indeed, is the density.",00:10:13.170,00:10:16.020
"So what I could do
is I can actually",00:10:16.020,00:10:19.850
"construct a
one-particle density.",00:10:19.850,00:10:23.210
"So I want to look at
some position in space",00:10:23.210,00:10:26.455
"at some time t and
ask whether or not",00:10:26.455,00:10:30.530
there are particles there.,00:10:30.530,00:10:34.960
"I don't care which
one of the particles.",00:10:34.960,00:10:37.220
"Actually, let's put in a
little bit more information;",00:10:37.220,00:10:40.300
"also, keep track of whether,
at some instant of time,",00:10:40.300,00:10:44.090
"I see at this
location particles.",00:10:44.090,00:10:47.350
"And these particles,
I will also ask",00:10:47.350,00:10:49.370
which direction they are moving.,00:10:49.370,00:10:51.020
"Maybe I'm also going
to think about the case",00:10:51.020,00:10:53.650
"where, in the intermediate,
I am flowing from one side",00:10:53.650,00:10:57.640
to another.,00:10:57.640,00:10:58.270
"And keeping track of both
of these is important.",00:10:58.270,00:11:01.840
"I said I don't care which
one of these particles",00:11:01.840,00:11:06.510
is contributing.,00:11:06.510,00:11:09.340
"So that means that I have
to sum over all particles",00:11:09.340,00:11:18.180
"and ask whether
or not, at time t,",00:11:18.180,00:11:23.345
"there is a particle at
location q with momentum p.",00:11:23.345,00:11:29.818
"So these delta functions are
supposed to enforce that.",00:11:32.890,00:11:37.490
"And again, I'm not thinking
about an individual trajectory,",00:11:37.490,00:11:41.860
"because I think, more or
less, all of the trajectories",00:11:41.860,00:11:44.750
"are going to behave
the same way.",00:11:44.750,00:11:46.970
"And so what I will do
is I take an ensemble",00:11:46.970,00:11:50.940
average of this quantity.,00:11:50.940,00:11:53.161
OK?,00:11:53.161,00:11:53.660
So what does that mean?,00:11:53.660,00:11:55.300
"To do an ensemble
average, we said",00:11:55.300,00:11:57.650
"I have to integrate the
density function, rho,",00:11:57.650,00:12:04.200
"which depends on all
of the coordinates.",00:12:04.200,00:12:06.970
"So I have coordinate
for particle one,",00:12:06.970,00:12:09.910
"coordinate-- particle and
momentum, particle and momentum",00:12:09.910,00:12:14.780
"for particle two,
for particle three,",00:12:14.780,00:12:17.690
"all the way to
particle number N.",00:12:17.690,00:12:22.750
"And this is something
that depends on time.",00:12:22.750,00:12:24.970
"That's where the time
dependence comes from.",00:12:24.970,00:12:26.920
"And again, let's think
about the time dependence",00:12:26.920,00:12:29.030
"where 0 is you
lift the partition",00:12:29.030,00:12:31.620
"and you allow things to
go from one to the other.",00:12:31.620,00:12:34.750
"So there is a non-equilibrium
process that you are following.",00:12:34.750,00:12:38.950
"What I need to do is I have
to multiply this density",00:12:38.950,00:12:44.120
"with the function that I
have to consider the average.",00:12:44.120,00:12:50.130
"Well, the function being a
delta function, it's very nice.",00:12:50.130,00:12:53.790
"The first term in the sum,
we'll set simply q1 equals to q.",00:12:53.790,00:12:59.980
"And it will set p1
equals to p when",00:12:59.980,00:13:04.440
"I do the integration
over p1 and q1.",00:13:04.440,00:13:08.490
"But then I'm left to have to do
the integration over particle",00:13:08.490,00:13:12.940
"two, particle three,
particle four, and so forth.",00:13:12.940,00:13:20.155
OK?,00:13:20.155,00:13:21.580
"But this is only the
first term in the sum.",00:13:21.580,00:13:24.930
"Then I have to write the
sum for particle number two,",00:13:24.930,00:13:27.480
"particle number
three, et cetera.",00:13:27.480,00:13:30.220
"But all of the particles,
as far as I'm concerned,",00:13:30.220,00:13:33.070
are behaving the same way.,00:13:33.070,00:13:34.720
"So I just need to multiply
this by a factor of N.",00:13:34.720,00:13:44.510
"Now, this is something that
actually we encountered before.",00:13:44.510,00:13:49.700
"Recall that this rho is a
joint probability distribution.",00:13:49.700,00:13:54.500
"It's a joint
probability distribution",00:13:54.500,00:13:56.600
"of all N particles, their
locations, and momentum.",00:13:56.600,00:14:01.010
"And we gave a name to taking
a joint probability density",00:14:01.010,00:14:10.510
"function, which this
is, and integrating",00:14:10.510,00:14:13.180
over some subset of variables.,00:14:13.180,00:14:16.266
"The answer is an unconditional
probability distribution.",00:14:16.266,00:14:21.150
"So essentially, the
end of this story",00:14:21.150,00:14:24.380
"is if I integrate
over coordinates",00:14:24.380,00:14:27.630
"of two all the way to N, I will
get an unconditional result",00:14:27.630,00:14:32.060
"pertaining to the first
set of coordinate.",00:14:32.060,00:14:34.840
"So this is the same thing
up to a factor of N--",00:14:34.840,00:14:38.470
"the unconditional probability
that I will call rho one.",00:14:38.470,00:14:43.110
"Actually, I should
have called this f1.",00:14:43.110,00:14:44.885
"So this is something
that is defined",00:14:47.830,00:14:50.570
to be the one particle density.,00:14:50.570,00:14:52.470
"I don't know why this name stuck
to it, because this one, that",00:14:58.540,00:15:04.430
"is up to a factor of
N different from it,",00:15:04.430,00:15:07.220
"is our usual unconditional
probability for one particle.",00:15:07.220,00:15:13.340
"So this is rho of p1 being
p, q1 being q at time.",00:15:13.340,00:15:28.944
OK?,00:15:28.944,00:15:30.850
"So essentially, what I've said
is I have a joint probability.",00:15:30.850,00:15:35.930
"I'm really interested
in one of the particles,",00:15:35.930,00:15:37.990
"so I just integrate
over all the others.",00:15:37.990,00:15:41.890
"And this is kind of
not very elegant,",00:15:41.890,00:15:47.190
"but that's somehow
the way that it",00:15:47.190,00:15:49.100
has appeared in the literature.,00:15:49.100,00:15:51.090
"The entity that I
have on the right",00:15:51.090,00:15:53.790
"is the properly
normalized probability.",00:15:53.790,00:15:59.730
"Once I multiply by N, it's a
quantity this is called f1.",00:15:59.730,00:16:05.960
"And it's called a density
and used very much",00:16:05.960,00:16:10.130
in the literature.,00:16:10.130,00:16:12.170
OK?,00:16:12.170,00:16:13.236
"And that's the thing that
I think will be useful.",00:16:13.236,00:16:16.240
"Essentially, all of
the things that I",00:16:16.240,00:16:20.420
"know about observations
of a system,",00:16:20.420,00:16:23.020
"such as its density,
its velocity, et cetera,",00:16:23.020,00:16:26.870
"I should be able
to get from this.",00:16:26.870,00:16:30.080
"Sometimes we need a little
bit more information,",00:16:30.080,00:16:33.800
"so I allow for the
possibility that I may also",00:16:33.800,00:16:36.610
"need to focus on a
two-particle density, where",00:16:36.610,00:16:41.570
"I keep information pertaining
to two particles at time t",00:16:41.570,00:16:48.710
"and I integrate over everybody
else that I'm not interested.",00:16:48.710,00:16:52.570
"So I introduce an integration
over coordinates number",00:16:52.570,00:16:58.180
"two-- sorry, number
three all the way to N",00:16:58.180,00:17:03.720
"to not have to repeat this
combination all the time.",00:17:03.720,00:17:09.280
"The 6N-dimensional
phase space for particle",00:17:09.280,00:17:12.520
i I will indicate by dVi.,00:17:12.520,00:17:15.839
"So I take the full N particle
density, if you like,",00:17:15.839,00:17:24.329
"integrate over
everybody except 2.",00:17:24.329,00:17:28.160
"And up to a normalization
of NN minus 1,",00:17:28.160,00:17:32.950
"this is called a
two-particle density.",00:17:32.950,00:17:35.940
"And again, absent
this normalization,",00:17:35.940,00:17:41.160
"this is simply the
unconditional probability",00:17:41.160,00:17:44.750
"that I would construct out
of this joint probability",00:17:44.750,00:17:47.592
[INAUDIBLE].,00:17:47.592,00:17:48.092
"And just for some mathematical
purposes, the generalization",00:17:55.970,00:18:00.340
"of this to S particles,
we will call fs.",00:18:00.340,00:18:05.370
"So this depends on p1
through qs at time t.",00:18:05.370,00:18:11.510
"And this is going to
be N factorial divided",00:18:11.510,00:18:14.740
"by N minus S
factorial in general.",00:18:14.740,00:18:18.910
"And they join the unconditional
probability that depends on S",00:18:18.910,00:18:24.110
"coordinates p1
through qs at time t.",00:18:24.110,00:18:29.466
OK?,00:18:34.312,00:18:34.812
"You'll see why I need
these higher ones",00:18:37.740,00:18:40.860
"although, in reality, all my
interest is on this first one,",00:18:40.860,00:18:47.620
"because practically
everything that I need",00:18:47.620,00:18:50.120
"to know about this initial
experiment that I set up",00:18:50.120,00:18:54.190
"and how a gas expands I
should be able to extract",00:18:54.190,00:18:57.550
from this one-particle density.,00:18:57.550,00:19:00.004
OK?,00:19:00.004,00:19:02.220
So how do I calculate this?,00:19:02.220,00:19:05.350
"Well, what I would
need to do is to look",00:19:05.350,00:19:08.770
"at the time variation
of fs with t",00:19:08.770,00:19:15.150
"to calculate the time dependence
of any one of these quantities.",00:19:15.150,00:19:20.290
"Ultimately, I want to have
an equation for df1 by dt.",00:19:20.290,00:19:24.040
But let's write the general one.,00:19:24.040,00:19:26.330
"So the general one is up
to, again, this N factorial,",00:19:26.330,00:19:33.850
"N minus s factorial
and integral over",00:19:33.850,00:19:44.510
"coordinates that I'm not
interested, of d rho by dt.",00:19:44.510,00:19:50.740
OK?,00:19:55.830,00:19:56.380
"So I just take the time
derivative inside the integral,",00:19:56.380,00:20:01.080
"because I know how
d rho by dt evolves.",00:20:01.080,00:20:04.580
"And so this is going to be
simply the Poisson bracket of H",00:20:04.580,00:20:11.900
and rho.,00:20:11.900,00:20:13.190
And I would proceed from there.,00:20:13.190,00:20:14.540
"Actually, to proceed
further and in order",00:20:17.980,00:20:20.150
"to be able to say things
that are related to physics,",00:20:20.150,00:20:25.870
"I need to say something
about the Hamiltonian.",00:20:25.870,00:20:28.410
"I can't do so in the
most general case.",00:20:28.410,00:20:32.940
"So let's write the
kind of Hamiltonian",00:20:32.940,00:20:35.030
"that we are interested
and describes the gas-- so",00:20:35.030,00:20:39.930
"the Hamiltonian for
the gas in this room.",00:20:39.930,00:20:44.530
"One term is simply
the kinetic energy.",00:20:44.530,00:20:46.640
"Another term is
that gas particles",00:20:52.360,00:20:55.420
are confined by some potential.,00:20:55.420,00:20:57.520
"The potential could be as easy
as the walls of this room.",00:20:57.520,00:21:01.740
"Or it could be some
more general potential",00:21:01.740,00:21:05.370
"that could include gravity,
whatever else you want.",00:21:05.370,00:21:09.660
"So let's include
that possibility.",00:21:09.660,00:21:14.850
"So these are so-called
one-body terms,",00:21:14.850,00:21:17.680
"because they pertain to the
coordinates of one particle.",00:21:17.680,00:21:21.670
"And then there are
two-body terms.",00:21:21.670,00:21:24.225
"So for example, I could look
at all pairs of particles.",00:21:24.225,00:21:27.840
"Let's say i not equal to j
to avoid self-interaction.",00:21:27.840,00:21:33.480
V of qi minus qj.,00:21:33.480,00:21:36.730
"So certainly, two particles
in this gas in this room,",00:21:36.730,00:21:40.910
"when they get close
enough, they certainly",00:21:40.910,00:21:44.760
can pass through each other.,00:21:44.760,00:21:46.290
They each have a size.,00:21:46.290,00:21:47.840
"But even when they are
a few times their sizes,",00:21:47.840,00:21:51.970
"they start to feel
some interaction, which",00:21:51.970,00:21:54.120
causes them to collide.,00:21:54.120,00:21:55.270
Yes.,00:21:55.270,00:21:56.269
"AUDIENCE: The whole
series of arguments",00:21:56.269,00:21:58.145
"that we're developing,
do these only hold",00:21:58.145,00:22:00.021
for time-independent potentials?,00:22:00.021,00:22:01.897
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:22:01.897,00:22:04.620
"Although, it is not that
difficult to sort of",00:22:04.620,00:22:07.820
"go through all of
these arguments",00:22:07.820,00:22:10.200
"and see where the corresponding
modifications are going to be.",00:22:10.200,00:22:13.940
"But certainly, the
very first thing",00:22:13.940,00:22:15.860
"that we are using, which is
this one, we kind of implicitly",00:22:15.860,00:22:21.030
"assume the time-independent
Hamiltonian.",00:22:21.030,00:22:23.810
"So you have to start changing
things from that point.",00:22:23.810,00:22:27.370
OK?,00:22:30.615,00:22:31.115
"So in principle, you could
have three-body and higher body",00:22:34.090,00:22:37.071
terms.,00:22:37.071,00:22:37.570
"But essentially, most
of the relevant physics",00:22:37.570,00:22:40.990
is captured by this.,00:22:40.990,00:22:42.330
"Even for things
like plasmas, this",00:22:42.330,00:22:44.970
"would be a reasonably
good approximation,",00:22:44.970,00:22:48.400
"with the Coulomb
interaction appearing here.",00:22:48.400,00:22:51.630
OK?,00:22:51.630,00:22:53.860
"Now, what I note is that what
I have to calculate over here",00:22:53.860,00:23:00.500
is a Poisson bracket.,00:23:00.500,00:23:04.710
"And then I have to integrate
that Poisson bracket.",00:23:04.710,00:23:08.760
"Poisson bracket
involves a whole bunch",00:23:08.760,00:23:10.860
"of derivatives over
all set of quantities.",00:23:10.860,00:23:14.620
"And I realize that when I'm
integrating over derivatives,",00:23:14.620,00:23:20.200
"there are
simplifications that can",00:23:20.200,00:23:22.280
"take place, such as
integration by parts.",00:23:22.280,00:23:25.410
"But that only will take
place when the derivative",00:23:25.410,00:23:30.260
"is one of the variables
that is being integrated.",00:23:30.260,00:23:34.590
"Now, this whole process has
separated out arguments of rho,",00:23:34.590,00:23:41.370
"as far as this
expression is concerned,",00:23:41.370,00:23:44.100
"into two sets-- one set, or the
set that is appearing out here,",00:23:44.100,00:23:48.980
"the first s ones that don't
undergo the integration,",00:23:48.980,00:23:53.820
"and then the remainder that
do undergo the integration.",00:23:53.820,00:23:58.250
"So this is going to be relevant
when we do our manipulations.",00:23:58.250,00:24:02.020
"And therefore, it is useful
to rewrite this Hamiltonian",00:24:02.020,00:24:06.400
in terms of three entities.,00:24:06.400,00:24:07.725
"The first one that I call
H sub s-- so if you like,",00:24:12.560,00:24:15.660
"this is an end
particle Hamiltonian.",00:24:15.660,00:24:18.550
"I can write an H sub s, which
is just exactly the same thing,",00:24:18.550,00:24:22.720
"except that it
applies to coordinates",00:24:22.720,00:24:25.560
that I'm not integrating over.,00:24:25.560,00:24:27.920
"And to sort of
make a distinction,",00:24:27.920,00:24:30.390
"I will label them by N. And
it includes the interaction",00:24:30.390,00:24:35.870
among those particles.,00:24:35.870,00:24:37.770
"And I can similarly
write something",00:24:45.900,00:24:48.930
"that pertains to coordinates
that I am integrating over.",00:24:48.930,00:24:55.780
I will label them by j and k.,00:24:55.780,00:24:58.930
"So this is s plus 1 to N, pj
squared over 2m plus u of qj",00:24:58.930,00:25:10.010
"plus 1/2 sum over j and
k, V of qj minus qk.",00:25:10.010,00:25:17.820
OK?,00:25:20.858,00:25:23.790
"So everything that involves one
set of coordinates, everything",00:25:23.790,00:25:27.420
"that involves the other
set of coordinates.",00:25:27.420,00:25:29.310
"So what is left are terms
that [? copy ?] one set of",00:25:29.310,00:25:35.090
coordinates to another.,00:25:35.090,00:25:37.090
"So N running from 1 to s,
j running from s plus 1",00:25:37.090,00:25:41.680
"to N, V between qm and qj.",00:25:41.680,00:25:48.340
OK?,00:25:48.340,00:25:48.840
"So let me rewrite this
equation rather than in terms",00:25:57.970,00:26:01.980
"of-- f in terms of the
probabilities' rhos.",00:26:01.980,00:26:09.450
"So the difference
only is that I don't",00:26:09.450,00:26:13.890
"have to include this
factor out front.",00:26:13.890,00:26:17.210
So I have dVi.,00:26:17.210,00:26:19.610
"I have the d rho by dt, which
is the commutator of H with rho,",00:26:19.610,00:26:27.150
"which I have been writing
as Hs plus HN minus s.",00:26:27.150,00:26:33.636
I'm changing the way I write s.,00:26:33.636,00:26:35.920
Sorry.,00:26:35.920,00:26:37.080
Plus H prime and rho.,00:26:37.080,00:26:41.376
OK?,00:26:41.376,00:26:44.250
"So there is a bit
of mathematics to be",00:26:44.250,00:26:46.650
performed to analyze this.,00:26:46.650,00:26:50.160
"There are three terms
that I will label a, b,",00:26:50.160,00:26:53.400
"and c, which are
the three Poisson",00:26:53.400,00:26:59.160
"brackets that I
have to evaluate.",00:26:59.160,00:27:02.450
"So the contribution
that I call a",00:27:02.450,00:27:06.310
"is the integral
over coordinates s",00:27:06.310,00:27:15.430
"plus 1 to N, of the Poisson
bracket of Hs with rho.",00:27:15.430,00:27:24.020
"Now, the Poisson bracket
is given up here.",00:27:24.020,00:27:29.130
"It is a sum that involves N
terms over all N particles.",00:27:29.130,00:27:35.650
"But since, if I'm
evaluating it for Hs and Hs",00:27:35.650,00:27:42.540
"will only give nonzero
derivatives with respect",00:27:42.540,00:27:46.270
"to the coordinates
that are present in it,",00:27:46.270,00:27:49.400
"this sum of N terms
actually becomes simply",00:27:49.400,00:27:51.755
a sum of small N terms.,00:27:51.755,00:27:54.850
"So I will get a sum over
N running from 1 to s.",00:27:54.850,00:28:01.860
These are the only terms.,00:28:01.860,00:28:03.570
"And I will get the things that
I have for d rho by dpN-- sorry,",00:28:03.570,00:28:11.715

"AUDIENCE: Isn't it the Poisson
bracket of rho H, not H rho?",00:28:40.634,00:28:46.418

"Oh, yes.",00:28:51.250,00:28:51.970
"So I have to put
a minus sign here.",00:28:51.970,00:28:54.720
Right.,00:28:54.720,00:28:55.220
Good.,00:28:55.220,00:28:56.200
Thank you.,00:28:56.200,00:28:57.180
OK.,00:29:01.590,00:29:02.580
"Now, note that these
derivatives and operations that",00:29:02.580,00:29:08.740
"involve Hs involve
coordinates that are not",00:29:08.740,00:29:13.800
"appearing in the
integration process.",00:29:13.800,00:29:18.460
"So I can take
these entities that",00:29:18.460,00:29:20.770
"do not depend on
variables that are part",00:29:20.770,00:29:23.190
"of the integration outside the
integration, which means that I",00:29:23.190,00:29:30.080
"can then write the
result as being",00:29:30.080,00:29:35.590
"an exchange of the order
of the Poisson bracket",00:29:35.590,00:29:44.480
and the integration.,00:29:44.480,00:29:47.850
"So I would essentially have the
integration only appear here,",00:29:47.850,00:30:04.750
"which is the same
thing as Hs and rho s.",00:30:04.750,00:30:17.940
This should be rho s.,00:30:17.940,00:30:19.350
"This is the definition of rho s,
which is the same thing as rho.",00:30:24.800,00:30:28.200
OK.,00:30:31.492,00:30:31.992
What does it mean physically?,00:30:34.807,00:30:36.015
"So it's actually much
easier to tell you",00:30:36.015,00:30:40.430
"what it means physically
than to do the math.",00:30:40.430,00:30:43.810
"So what we saw was
happening was that if I",00:30:43.810,00:30:48.500
"have a Hamiltonian that
describes N particles, then",00:30:48.500,00:30:52.960
"for that Hamiltonian,
the corresponding density",00:30:52.960,00:30:58.370
"satisfies this
Liouville equation.",00:30:58.370,00:30:59.980
D rho by dt is HN rho.,00:30:59.980,00:31:02.810
"And this was a consequence of
this divergence-less character",00:31:02.810,00:31:07.620
"of the flow that we
have in this space,",00:31:07.620,00:31:09.810
"that the equations that
we write down over here",00:31:09.810,00:31:13.620
"for p dot and q
dot in terms of H",00:31:13.620,00:31:17.220
"had this character that
the divergence was 0.",00:31:17.220,00:31:21.820
OK?,00:31:21.820,00:31:23.410
"Now, this is true if I have
any number of particles.",00:31:23.410,00:31:28.230
"So if I focus simply
on s of the particles,",00:31:28.230,00:31:34.410
"and they are governed
by this Hamiltonian,",00:31:34.410,00:31:38.416
"and I don't have anything
else in the universe,",00:31:38.416,00:31:41.640
"as far as this
Hamiltonian is concerned,",00:31:41.640,00:31:44.400
"I should have the analog
of a Liouville equation.",00:31:44.400,00:31:48.740
"So the term that I have obtained
over there from this first term",00:31:48.740,00:31:52.720
"is simply stating
that d rho s by dt,",00:31:52.720,00:31:56.430
"if there was no other
interaction with anybody else,",00:31:56.430,00:31:59.620
"would simply satisfy the
corresponding Liouville",00:31:59.620,00:32:02.960
equation for s particles.,00:32:02.960,00:32:06.170
"And because of that, we
also expect and anticipate--",00:32:06.170,00:32:09.620
"and I'll show that
mathematically--",00:32:09.620,00:32:11.990
"that the next term
in the series,",00:32:11.990,00:32:13.890
"that is the Poisson bracket
of N minus s and rho,",00:32:13.890,00:32:18.800
"should be 0, because as
far as this s particles",00:32:18.800,00:32:23.760
"that I'm focusing on
and how they evolve,",00:32:23.760,00:32:28.780
"they really don't care about
what all the other particles",00:32:28.780,00:32:33.290
"are doing if they
are not [INAUDIBLE].",00:32:33.290,00:32:35.970
"So anything interesting
should ultimately",00:32:35.970,00:32:37.685
come from this third term.,00:32:37.685,00:32:39.940
"But let's actually go and do the
calculation for the second term",00:32:39.940,00:32:44.530
"to show that this anticipation
that the answer should be 0",00:32:44.530,00:32:49.510
does hold up and why.,00:32:49.510,00:32:51.190
"So for the second term, I need
to calculate a similar Poisson",00:32:55.100,00:33:02.410
"bracket, except that
this second Poisson",00:33:02.410,00:33:05.690
bracket involves H of N minus s.,00:33:05.690,00:33:09.290
"And H of N minus s, when
I put in the full sum,",00:33:09.290,00:33:14.790
"will only get contribution from
terms that start from s plus 1.",00:33:14.790,00:33:19.530
"So the same way that
that started from N,",00:33:19.530,00:33:22.100
"this contribution starts
from s plus 1 to N.",00:33:22.100,00:33:27.840
"And actually, I can just write
the whole thing as above, d",00:33:27.840,00:33:31.360
"rho by d qj dotted by d HN minus
s by dpj, plus d rho by-- no,",00:33:31.360,00:33:50.570
"this is the rho. d rho by d pj
dotted by dHN minus s by dqj.",00:33:50.570,00:34:01.990
"So now I have a totally
different situation",00:34:11.340,00:34:16.010
"from the previous case,
because the previous case,",00:34:16.010,00:34:19.010
"the derivatives were over
things I was not integrating.",00:34:19.010,00:34:22.630
"I could take outside
the integral.",00:34:22.630,00:34:26.500
"Now all of the
derivatives involve things",00:34:26.500,00:34:29.010
that I'm integrating over.,00:34:29.010,00:34:31.252
"Now, when that happens, then
you do integration by parts.",00:34:31.252,00:34:36.090
"So what you do is
you take rho outside",00:34:36.090,00:34:42.620
"and let the derivative
act on everything else.",00:34:42.620,00:34:47.400
OK?,00:34:47.400,00:34:49.080
"So what do we end up with if
we do integration by parts?",00:34:49.080,00:34:54.219
I will get surface terms.,00:35:02.640,00:35:06.140
"Surface terms are essentially
rho-evaluated when",00:35:06.140,00:35:09.130
"the coordinates are at
infinity or at the edge",00:35:09.130,00:35:11.660
"of your space, where rho is 0.",00:35:11.660,00:35:14.360
So there is no surface term.,00:35:14.360,00:35:17.080
"There is an overall
change in sign,",00:35:17.080,00:35:19.140
"so I will get a product
i running from s plus 1",00:35:19.140,00:35:23.540
"to N, dVi.",00:35:23.540,00:35:27.420
Now the rho comes outside.,00:35:27.420,00:35:30.640
"And the derivative acts on
everything that is left.",00:35:30.640,00:35:34.840
"So the first term will
give me a second derivative",00:35:34.840,00:35:37.470
"of HN minus s, with respect
to p, with respect to q.",00:35:37.470,00:35:45.930
"And the second term will be
essentially the opposite way",00:35:45.930,00:35:49.560
of doing the derivative.,00:35:49.560,00:35:50.560
"And these two are,
of course, the same.",00:35:57.130,00:35:58.787
And the answer is 0.,00:35:58.787,00:35:59.620
OK?,00:36:03.106,00:36:04.600
"So we do expect that
the evolution of all",00:36:04.600,00:36:10.845
"the other particles
should not affect",00:36:10.845,00:36:13.650
"the subset that
we are looking at.",00:36:13.650,00:36:15.920
And that's worn out also.,00:36:15.920,00:36:18.550
"So the only thing
that potentially",00:36:18.550,00:36:20.710
"will be relevant and exciting
is the last term, number c.",00:36:20.710,00:36:26.470
So let's take a look at that.,00:36:26.470,00:36:29.030
"So here, I have to do an
integration over variables",00:36:29.030,00:36:34.170
that I am not interested.,00:36:34.170,00:36:38.580
"And then I need now,
however, to do a full Poisson",00:36:38.580,00:36:49.470
"bracket of a whole
bunch of terms,",00:36:49.470,00:36:53.080
"because now the terms
that I'm looking at",00:36:53.080,00:36:55.900
have coordinates from both sets.,00:36:55.900,00:36:58.510
"So I have to be a
little bit careful.",00:36:58.510,00:37:01.200
"So let me just make sure that
I follow the notes that I",00:37:01.200,00:37:10.160
"have here and don't
make mistakes.",00:37:10.160,00:37:11.720
OK.,00:37:15.620,00:37:17.140
"So this H prime
involves two sums.",00:37:17.140,00:37:19.935
"So I will write the first
sum, N running from 1 to s.",00:37:23.260,00:37:31.730
"And then I have the second
sum, j running from s",00:37:31.730,00:37:37.480
plus 1 to N. What do I need?,00:37:37.480,00:37:42.890
I need the-- OK.,00:37:42.890,00:38:01.774
Let's do it the following way.,00:38:04.740,00:38:07.490
"So what I have to do
for the Poisson bracket",00:38:07.490,00:38:12.910
"is a sum that involves
all coordinates.",00:38:12.910,00:38:16.690
"So let's just write
this whole expression.",00:38:16.690,00:38:20.070
"But first, for
coordinates 1 through s.",00:38:20.070,00:38:23.700
"So I have a sum N
running from 1 to s.",00:38:23.700,00:38:27.500
"And then I will
write the term that",00:38:27.500,00:38:29.360
"corresponds to
coordinates s plus 1 to m.",00:38:29.360,00:38:32.456
"For the first set of
coordinates, what do I have?",00:38:32.456,00:38:37.400
I have d rho by dqn.,00:38:37.400,00:38:43.520
"And then I have
d H prime by dpn.",00:38:43.520,00:38:47.510
"So I didn't write
H prime explicitly.",00:38:47.510,00:38:50.410
"I'm just breaking
the sum over here.",00:38:50.410,00:38:54.150
"And then I have sum j
running from s plus 1 to N,",00:38:54.150,00:39:04.590
"d rho by dqj times
d H prime by dpj.",00:39:04.590,00:39:14.381
"And again, my H prime
is this entity over here",00:39:14.381,00:39:20.690
"that [? copies ?]
coordinates from both sets.",00:39:20.690,00:39:25.100
OK.,00:39:25.100,00:39:26.780
"First thing is I claim that one
of these two sets of sums is 0.",00:39:26.780,00:39:32.970
You tell me which.,00:39:32.970,00:39:34.926
AUDIENCE: The first.,00:39:34.926,00:39:36.300
PROFESSOR: Why first?,00:39:36.300,00:39:37.830
"AUDIENCE: Because H prime is
independent of p [? dot. ?]",00:39:37.830,00:39:42.764
PROFESSOR: That's true.,00:39:48.416,00:39:50.200
OK.,00:39:50.200,00:39:50.700
That's very good.,00:39:50.700,00:39:52.170
"And then it sort of brings
up a very important question,",00:39:52.170,00:39:55.580
"which is, I forgot to
write two more terms.",00:39:55.580,00:39:57.710
[LAUGHTER],00:39:57.710,00:40:01.787

"s plus 1 to N of d rho by

"So indeed, both answers
now were correct.",00:40:32.320,00:40:35.760
"Somebody said that
the first term",00:40:35.760,00:40:37.620
"is a 0, because H prime
does not depend on pn.",00:40:37.620,00:40:41.770
"And somebody over here
said that this term is 0.",00:40:41.770,00:40:45.310
And maybe they can explain why.,00:40:45.310,00:40:48.844
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:40:48.844,00:40:51.149

reason as up here.",00:40:51.149,00:40:53.250

term plus this term together.",00:40:57.196,00:41:03.890
"So it's actually
by itself is not 0.",00:41:03.890,00:41:08.310
"But if I do
integration by parts,",00:41:08.310,00:41:11.710
"I will have-- actually,
even by itself, it is 0,",00:41:11.710,00:41:14.550
"because I would have d
by dqj, d by pj, H prime.",00:41:14.550,00:41:19.183
"And H prime, you cannot
have a double derivative pj.",00:41:19.183,00:41:22.900
"So each one of them,
actually, by itself is 0.",00:41:22.900,00:41:25.740
"But in general, they would
also cancel each other",00:41:25.740,00:41:28.480

Yes.,00:41:30.621,00:41:31.120

of [? dH ?] of [? H prime? ?]",00:41:31.120,00:41:34.100

the sign incorrect?",00:41:34.100,00:41:35.820
Yes.,00:41:35.820,00:41:36.570

reason or other,",00:41:36.570,00:41:39.120

is rho and H. So let's do this.",00:41:39.120,00:41:46.048

PROFESSOR: OK.,00:41:54.886,00:41:55.920
"Yes, it is different.",00:41:55.920,00:41:57.170
Yes.,00:41:57.170,00:41:57.670
"So what I said, if I had
a more general Hamiltonian",00:41:57.670,00:42:03.430
"that also depended
on momentum, then",00:42:03.430,00:42:07.200
"this term would, by itself
not 0, but would cancel,",00:42:07.200,00:42:11.020
"be the corresponding
term from here.",00:42:11.020,00:42:13.370
"But the way that I
have for H prime,",00:42:13.370,00:42:15.290
"indeed, each term by
itself would be 0.",00:42:15.290,00:42:19.010
OK.,00:42:19.010,00:42:19.510
"So hopefully-- then
what do we have?",00:42:19.510,00:42:24.330
"So actually, let's keep the
sign correct and do this,",00:42:27.150,00:42:34.240

PROFESSOR: d by dqj.,00:44:07.884,00:44:10.200
All right?,00:44:13.400,00:44:14.442
AUDIENCE: Where is the qn?,00:44:14.442,00:44:17.025
PROFESSOR: d by dqn.,00:44:17.025,00:44:19.161
Thank you.,00:44:19.161,00:44:20.604
Right.,00:44:20.604,00:44:22.050
"Because always, pn of
qn would go together.",00:44:22.050,00:44:25.390
Thank you.,00:44:25.390,00:44:26.764
OK.,00:44:26.764,00:44:27.264
All right.,00:44:31.121,00:44:31.620
"So we have to slog
through these derivations.",00:44:31.620,00:44:34.870
"And then I'll give you
the physical meaning.",00:44:34.870,00:44:38.980
So I can rearrange this.,00:44:38.980,00:44:43.075
Let's see what's happening here.,00:44:46.750,00:44:49.910
"I have here a sum
over particles that",00:44:49.910,00:44:55.180
"are not listed on
the left-hand side.",00:44:55.180,00:44:58.980
"So when I wrote
this d rho by dt,",00:44:58.980,00:45:02.660
"I had listed coordinates
going from p1 through qs that",00:45:02.660,00:45:07.090
"were s coordinates
that were listed.",00:45:07.090,00:45:09.940
"If you like, you can think
of them as s particles.",00:45:09.940,00:45:12.520
"Now, this sum involves
the remaining particles.",00:45:17.030,00:45:21.460
What is this?,00:45:21.460,00:45:22.540
Up to a sign.,00:45:22.540,00:45:23.690
"This is the force that
is exerted by particle j",00:45:23.690,00:45:28.000
"from the list of
particles that I'm not",00:45:28.000,00:45:30.150
"interested on one of the
particles on the list",00:45:30.150,00:45:33.410
that I am interested.,00:45:33.410,00:45:35.262
OK?,00:45:35.262,00:45:38.090
"Now, I expect that at the end
of the day, all of the particles",00:45:38.090,00:45:42.140
"that I am not interested
I can treat equivalently,",00:45:42.140,00:45:46.950
"like everything
that we had before,",00:45:46.950,00:45:49.460
"like how I got this factor
of N or N minus 1 over there.",00:45:49.460,00:45:55.140
"I expect that all of these will
give me the same result, which",00:45:55.140,00:46:01.700
"is proportional to the number
of these particles, which",00:46:01.700,00:46:06.410
is N minus s.,00:46:06.410,00:46:08.462
OK?,00:46:08.462,00:46:11.110
"And then I can focus on just
one of the terms in this sum.",00:46:11.110,00:46:14.950
"Let's say the term
that corresponds to j,",00:46:14.950,00:46:17.495
being s plus 1.,00:46:17.495,00:46:18.450
"Now, having done that,
I have to be careful.",00:46:23.480,00:46:28.870
"I can do separately
the integration",00:46:28.870,00:46:32.210
"over the volume of this one
coordinate that I'm keeping,",00:46:32.210,00:46:37.660
V of s plus 1.,00:46:37.660,00:46:39.930
And what do I have here?,00:46:39.930,00:46:42.270
"I have the force that
exerted on particle number N",00:46:42.270,00:46:49.180
"by the particle that
is labelled s plus 1.",00:46:49.180,00:46:52.520
"And this force is dot
producted with a gradient",00:46:57.880,00:47:03.540
"along the momentum in direction
of particle N of its density.",00:47:03.540,00:47:12.390
"Actually, this is the
density of all particles.",00:47:12.390,00:47:15.820
"This is the rho that
corresponds to the joint.",00:47:15.820,00:47:20.510
"But I had here s
plus 1 integrations.",00:47:20.510,00:47:24.950
"One of them I wrote
down explicitly.",00:47:24.950,00:47:27.860
All the others I do over here.,00:47:27.860,00:47:30.028
Of the density.,00:47:36.860,00:47:38.540
"So basically, I change the
order of the derivative",00:47:38.540,00:47:43.770
"and the integrations over
the variables not involved",00:47:43.770,00:47:46.890
in the remainder.,00:47:46.890,00:47:48.670
"And the reason I
did that, of course,",00:47:48.670,00:47:51.450
"is that then this
is my rho s plus 1.",00:47:51.450,00:47:54.875
OK?,00:47:58.590,00:48:00.930
"So what we have at
the end of the day",00:48:00.930,00:48:05.160
"is that if I take the time
variation of an s particle",00:48:05.160,00:48:13.130
"density, I will get one
term that I expected,",00:48:13.130,00:48:21.380
"which is if those s particles
were interacting only",00:48:21.380,00:48:26.060
"with themselves, I would
write the Liouville equation",00:48:26.060,00:48:30.620
"that would be
appropriate to them.",00:48:30.620,00:48:34.460
"But because of the
collisions that I",00:48:34.460,00:48:36.510
"can have with particles
that are not over here,",00:48:36.510,00:48:41.930
"suddenly, the momenta that
I'm looking at could change.",00:48:41.930,00:48:46.010
"And because of that, I
have a correction term here",00:48:46.010,00:48:50.400
"that really describes
the collisions.",00:48:50.400,00:48:53.170
"It says here that
these s particles",00:48:53.170,00:48:57.980
"were following the
trajectory that",00:48:57.980,00:49:00.870
"was governed by the
Hamiltonian that",00:49:00.870,00:49:03.400
was peculiar to the s particles.,00:49:03.400,00:49:06.330
"But suddenly, one of them had
a collision with somebody else.",00:49:06.330,00:49:11.210
So which one of them?,00:49:11.210,00:49:12.800
"Well, any one of them.",00:49:12.800,00:49:14.200
"So I could get a contribution
from any one of the s particles",00:49:14.200,00:49:20.160
"that is listed over here, having
a collision with somebody else.",00:49:20.160,00:49:24.970
"How do I describe
the effect of that?",00:49:24.970,00:49:27.970
"I have to do an integration over
where this new particle that I",00:49:27.970,00:49:37.020
am colliding with could be.,00:49:37.020,00:49:39.160
"I have to specify both where the
particle is that I am colliding",00:49:39.160,00:49:43.090
"with, as well as its momentum.",00:49:43.090,00:49:47.750
So that's this.,00:49:47.750,00:49:50.100
"Then I need to know the
force that this particle is",00:49:50.100,00:49:55.190
exerting on me.,00:49:55.190,00:49:56.420
"So that's the V of qs plus
1 minus qN divided by dqN.",00:49:56.420,00:50:05.680
"This is the force that is
exerted by this particle",00:50:05.680,00:50:10.240
that I don't see on myself.,00:50:10.240,00:50:13.980
"Then I have to multiply this,
or a dot product of this,",00:50:13.980,00:50:18.990
"with d by dpN, because what
happens in the process,",00:50:18.990,00:50:23.840
"because of this force, the
momentum of the N particle",00:50:23.840,00:50:28.150
is changing.,00:50:28.150,00:50:29.880
"The variation of
that is captured",00:50:29.880,00:50:34.300
"through looking at
the density that",00:50:34.300,00:50:38.080
"has all of these particles in
addition to this new particle",00:50:38.080,00:50:44.370
that I am colliding with.,00:50:44.370,00:50:46.250
"But, of course, I am not really
interested in the coordinate",00:50:46.250,00:50:50.270
"of this new particle,
so I integrate over it.",00:50:50.270,00:50:54.970
"There are N minus
s such particles.",00:50:54.970,00:50:57.670
"So I really have to put
a factor of N minus s",00:50:57.670,00:51:00.280
"here for all of
potential collisions.",00:51:00.280,00:51:04.640
And so that's the equation.,00:51:04.640,00:51:05.775
"Again, it is more common,
rather than to write",00:51:09.010,00:51:13.900
"the equation for rho, to
write the equation for f.",00:51:13.900,00:51:20.150
"And the f's and the
rhos where simply",00:51:20.150,00:51:22.730
"related by these factors of
N factorial over N minus 1",00:51:22.730,00:51:27.270
s factorial.,00:51:27.270,00:51:28.880
"And the outcome of that
is that the equation for f",00:51:28.880,00:51:36.550
"simply does not have this
additional factor of N minus s,",00:51:36.550,00:51:41.160
"because that disappears
in the ratio of rho",00:51:41.160,00:51:44.190
of s plus 1 and rho s.,00:51:44.190,00:51:46.230
"And it becomes a sum over
N running from 1 to s.",00:51:46.230,00:51:53.690
"Integral over coordinates and
momenta of a particle s plus 1.",00:51:53.690,00:52:01.790
"The force exerted
by particle s plus 1",00:52:04.620,00:52:08.660
"on particle N used to vary the
momentum of the N particle.",00:52:08.660,00:52:19.540
"And the whole thing would depend
on the density that includes,",00:52:19.540,00:52:25.040
"in addition to the s
particles that I had before,",00:52:25.040,00:52:30.850
"the new particle that
I am colliding with.",00:52:30.850,00:52:33.810
OK?,00:52:36.642,00:52:39.010
"So there is a set
of equations that",00:52:39.010,00:52:42.190
"relates the different densities
and how they evolve in time.",00:52:42.190,00:52:48.730
"The evolution of f1, which is
the thing that I am interested,",00:52:48.730,00:52:53.660
"will have, on the
right-hand side,",00:52:53.660,00:52:55.420
something that involves f2.,00:52:55.420,00:52:57.850
"The evolution of
f2 will involve f3.",00:52:57.850,00:53:01.100
"And this whole thing is
called a BBGKY hierarchy,",00:53:01.100,00:53:05.910
"after people whose names
I have in the notes.",00:53:05.910,00:53:09.760
[SOFT LAUGHTER],00:53:09.760,00:53:11.500
"But again, what have
we learned beyond what",00:53:13.620,00:53:19.450
we had in the original case?,00:53:19.450,00:53:21.315
"And originally,
we had an equation",00:53:21.315,00:53:23.720
"that was governing a function
in 6N-dimensional space, which",00:53:23.720,00:53:29.370
we really don't need.,00:53:29.370,00:53:30.770
"So we tried our
best to avoid that.",00:53:30.770,00:53:33.500
"We said that all of the physics
is in one particle, maybe",00:53:33.500,00:53:36.700
two particle densities.,00:53:36.700,00:53:38.560
"Let's calculate the evolution
of one-particle and two-particle",00:53:38.560,00:53:41.770
densities.,00:53:41.770,00:53:42.800
"Maybe they will tell us about
this non-equilibrium situation",00:53:42.800,00:53:45.980
that we set up.,00:53:45.980,00:53:47.340
"But we see that the time
evolution of the first particle",00:53:47.340,00:53:50.860
"density requires
two-particle density.",00:53:50.860,00:53:53.410
"Two-particle density requires
three-particle densities.",00:53:53.410,00:53:56.700
"So we sort of made this
ladder, which ultimately will",00:53:56.700,00:54:01.250
"[? terminate ?] at the
Nth particle densities.",00:54:01.250,00:54:03.740
"And so we have not
really gained much.",00:54:03.740,00:54:08.040
"So we have to now look at these
equations a little bit more",00:54:08.040,00:54:13.050
and try to inject more physics.,00:54:13.050,00:54:17.150
"So let's write down the
first two terms explicitly.",00:54:17.150,00:54:20.755
"So what I will do is I will
take this Poisson bracket of H",00:54:23.340,00:54:28.580
"and f, to the left-hand
side, and use the Hamiltonian",00:54:28.580,00:54:32.850
"that we have over here
to write the terms.",00:54:32.850,00:54:37.760
"So the equation that we
have for f1-- and I'm",00:54:37.760,00:54:41.680
"going to write it as a
whole bunch of derivatives",00:54:41.680,00:54:44.360
acting on f1.,00:54:44.360,00:54:46.980
f1 is a function of p1 q1 t.,00:54:46.980,00:54:52.930
"And essentially, what
Liouville's theorem",00:54:52.930,00:54:57.100
"says is that as you move
along the trajectory,",00:54:57.100,00:55:01.100
"the total derivative is
0, because the expansion",00:55:01.100,00:55:06.290
of the flows is incompressible.,00:55:06.290,00:55:08.720
So what does that mean?,00:55:08.720,00:55:10.670
"It means that d by dt, which
is this argument, plus q1 dot",00:55:10.670,00:55:17.870
"times d by dq1 plus
p1 dot by d by dp1.",00:55:17.870,00:55:25.126
"So here, I should write
p1 dot and q1 dot.",00:55:27.960,00:55:31.775
"In the absence of
everything else is 0.",00:55:34.670,00:55:37.340
"Then, of course, for q1
dot, we use the momentum",00:55:37.340,00:55:44.790
that we would get out of this.,00:55:44.790,00:55:46.820
"q1 dot is momentum
divided by mass.",00:55:46.820,00:55:53.060
So that's the velocity.,00:55:53.060,00:55:55.790
"And p1 dot, changing
momentum, is",00:55:55.790,00:55:59.740
"the force, is minus dH by dq1.",00:55:59.740,00:56:02.905
"So this is minus d of this
one particle potential divided",00:56:02.905,00:56:09.360
by dq1 dotted by [? h ?] p1.,00:56:09.360,00:56:14.630
"So if you were asked to think
about one particle in a box,",00:56:14.630,00:56:21.240
"then you know its
equation of motion.",00:56:21.240,00:56:24.400
"If you have many,
many realizations",00:56:24.400,00:56:27.470
"of that particle in a box,
you can construct a density.",00:56:27.470,00:56:32.080
"Each one of the elements
of the trajectory,",00:56:32.080,00:56:34.186
"you know how they
evolve according",00:56:34.186,00:56:36.250
to [? Newton's ?] equation.,00:56:36.250,00:56:38.010
"And you can see how the
density would evolve.",00:56:38.010,00:56:43.120
"It would evolve
according to this.",00:56:43.120,00:56:45.540
"I would have said, equal to 0.",00:56:45.540,00:56:48.280
"But I can't set it to 0 if I'm
really thinking about a gas,",00:56:48.280,00:56:53.420
"because my particle
can come and collide",00:56:53.420,00:56:56.360
"with a second
particle in the gas.",00:56:56.360,00:57:00.050
"The second particle
can be anywhere.",00:57:00.050,00:57:02.980
"And what it will do is that
it will exert a force, which",00:57:02.980,00:57:11.570
"would be like this,
on particle one.",00:57:11.570,00:57:15.000
"And this force will
change the momentum.",00:57:15.000,00:57:17.300
"So my variation of
the momentum will not",00:57:17.300,00:57:20.040
"come only from the
external force,",00:57:20.040,00:57:22.410
"but also from the
force that is coming",00:57:22.410,00:57:27.100
"from some other
particle in the medium.",00:57:27.100,00:57:30.380
"So that's where
this d by dp really",00:57:30.380,00:57:33.640
"gets not only the
external force but also",00:57:33.640,00:57:37.080
the force from somebody else.,00:57:37.080,00:57:39.890
"But then I need to know
where this other particle is,",00:57:39.890,00:57:42.830
"given that I know where
my first particle is.",00:57:42.830,00:57:45.830
"So I have to include here a
two-particle density which",00:57:45.830,00:57:50.340
"depends on p1 as
well as q2 at time t.",00:57:50.340,00:57:56.740
OK.,00:57:56.740,00:57:58.230
Fine.,00:57:58.230,00:58:00.546
"Now you say, OK, let's write
down-- I need to know f2.",00:58:00.546,00:58:05.420
"Let's write down
the equation for f2.",00:58:05.420,00:58:07.220
So I will write it more rapidly.,00:58:07.220,00:58:12.110
"I have p1 over m, d by dq1.",00:58:12.110,00:58:15.500
"I have p2 over m, d by dq2.",00:58:15.500,00:58:22.232
"I will have dU by dq1, d by dp1.",00:58:22.232,00:58:27.450
"I will have dU by dq2, d by dp2.",00:58:27.450,00:58:35.580
"I will have also a term from
the collision between q1 and q2.",00:58:35.580,00:58:40.470
"And once it will change the
momentum of the first particle,",00:58:44.500,00:58:49.680
"but it will change the
momentum of the second particle",00:58:49.680,00:58:52.490
in the opposite direction.,00:58:52.490,00:58:53.735
"So I will put the
two of them together.",00:58:53.735,00:58:57.110
"So this is all of the terms that
I would get from H2, Poisson",00:58:57.110,00:59:03.050
"bracket with density acting
on the two-particle density.",00:59:03.050,00:59:06.600
"And the answer would be
0 if the two particles",00:59:09.530,00:59:13.220
were the only thing in the box.,00:59:13.220,00:59:15.490
"But there's also
other particles.",00:59:15.490,00:59:17.910
"So there can be
interactions and collisions",00:59:17.910,00:59:20.770
with a third particle.,00:59:20.770,00:59:22.700
"And for that, I
would need to know,",00:59:22.700,00:59:25.920
"let's actually try
to simplify notation.",00:59:25.920,00:59:29.680
"This is the force that is
exerted from two to one.",00:59:29.680,00:59:35.470
"So I will have here the
force from three to one",00:59:35.470,00:59:41.822
dotted by d by dp1.,00:59:41.822,00:59:44.075
Right.,00:59:48.380,00:59:49.240
"And the force that is
exerted from three to two",00:59:49.240,00:59:52.600
"dotted by d by dp2 acting on
a three-particle density that",00:59:52.600,00:59:57.910
involves everything up to three.,00:59:57.910,01:00:02.870
"And now let's write
the third one.",01:00:02.870,01:00:04.880
[LAUGHTER],01:00:04.880,01:00:07.380
"So that, I will leave
to next lecture.",01:00:08.380,01:00:10.390
"But anyway, so this
is the structure.",01:00:10.390,01:00:14.250
"Now, this is the
point at which we",01:00:14.250,01:00:15.840
"would like to inject some
physics into the problem.",01:00:15.840,01:00:23.340
"So what we are going to do is to
estimate the various terms that",01:00:23.340,01:00:30.080
"are appearing in this
equation to see whether there",01:00:30.080,01:00:33.880
"is some approximation
that we can make",01:00:33.880,01:00:37.582
"to make the equations more
treatable and handle-able.",01:00:37.582,01:00:42.680
All right?,01:00:42.680,01:00:45.090
"So let's try to look
at the case of a gas--",01:00:45.090,01:00:54.900
let's say the gas in this room.,01:00:54.900,01:00:58.160
"A typical thing
that is happening",01:00:58.160,01:01:01.790
"in the particles of
the gas in this room",01:01:01.790,01:01:03.690
is that they are zipping around.,01:01:03.690,01:01:06.240
"Their velocity is of
the order-- again,",01:01:06.240,01:01:09.760
"just order of magnitude,
hundreds of meters per second.",01:01:09.760,01:01:14.991
OK?,01:01:14.991,01:01:15.490
"So we are going to, again,
be very sort of limited",01:01:15.490,01:01:20.899
"in what we are
trying to describe.",01:01:20.899,01:01:22.315
There is this experiment.,01:01:22.315,01:01:24.110
Gas expands into a chamber.,01:01:24.110,01:01:26.585
"In room temperature, typical
velocities are of this order.",01:01:26.585,01:01:30.802
"Now we are going to
use that to estimate",01:01:30.802,01:01:34.620
"the magnitude of the
various terms that",01:01:34.620,01:01:36.710
are appearing in this equation.,01:01:36.710,01:01:39.830
"Now, the whole thing
about this equation",01:01:39.830,01:01:42.200
is variation with time.,01:01:42.200,01:01:44.870
"So the entity that
we are looking",01:01:44.870,01:01:46.920
"at in all of these
brackets is this d by dt,",01:01:46.920,01:01:51.450
"which means that the various
terms in this differential",01:01:51.450,01:01:55.830
"equation, apart
from d by dt, have",01:01:55.830,01:01:58.980
"to have dimensions
of inverse time.",01:01:58.980,01:02:03.320
"So we are going to
try to characterize",01:02:03.320,01:02:06.620
what those inverse times are.,01:02:06.620,01:02:08.220
"So what are the typical
magnitudes of various terms?",01:02:12.430,01:02:21.355
"If I look at the
first equation, I",01:02:25.640,01:02:28.740
"said what that first
equation describes.",01:02:28.740,01:02:31.640
"That first equation describes
for you a particle in a box.",01:02:31.640,01:02:35.180
"We've forgotten about
everything else.",01:02:35.180,01:02:38.390
"So if I have a
particle in a box,",01:02:38.390,01:02:41.710
what is the characteristic time?,01:02:41.710,01:02:43.590
"It has to be set by the
size of the box, given",01:02:43.590,01:02:46.730
"that I am moving
with that velocity.",01:02:46.730,01:02:49.740
"So there is a
timescale that I would",01:02:49.740,01:02:52.550
"call extrinsic in the
sense that it is not really",01:02:52.550,01:02:57.215
a property of the gas.,01:02:57.215,01:02:58.640
"It will be different if
I make the box bigger.",01:02:58.640,01:03:02.020
"There's a timescale
over which I would",01:03:02.020,01:03:04.010
"go from one side of the box
to another side of the box.",01:03:04.010,01:03:07.430
"So this is kind of
a timescale that",01:03:07.430,01:03:09.920
"is related to the term
that knows something",01:03:09.920,01:03:13.100
"about the box, which
is dU by dq, d by dp.",01:03:13.100,01:03:17.140
"I would say that if I were to
assign some typical magnitude",01:03:17.140,01:03:21.480
"to this type of
term, I would say",01:03:21.480,01:03:24.170
"that it is related to having
to traverse a distance that",01:03:24.170,01:03:31.980
"is of the order of
the size of the box,",01:03:31.980,01:03:39.630
"given the velocity
that I have specified.",01:03:39.630,01:03:42.640
This is an inverse timescale.,01:03:42.640,01:03:44.465
Right?,01:03:44.465,01:03:45.950
"And let's sort of
imagine that I have an--",01:03:45.950,01:03:50.190
"and I will call this
timescale 1 over tau U,",01:03:50.190,01:03:55.620
"because it is sort of
determined by my external U.",01:03:55.620,01:04:00.610
"Let's say we have
a typical size that",01:04:00.610,01:04:03.070
is of the order of millimeter.,01:04:03.070,01:04:04.760
"If I make it larger,
it will be larger.",01:04:04.760,01:04:06.890
"So actually, let's say we
have 10 to the minus 3 meters.",01:04:06.890,01:04:12.520
"Actually, let's make it bigger.",01:04:12.520,01:04:14.340
"Let's make it of the order
of 10 to the minus 1 meter.",01:04:14.340,01:04:18.740
Kind of reasonable-sized box.,01:04:18.740,01:04:20.900
"Then you would say
that this 1 over tau c",01:04:20.900,01:04:24.270
"is of the order of 10 to the 2
divided by 10 to the minus 1,",01:04:24.270,01:04:29.010
"which is of the order of 1,000.",01:04:29.010,01:04:31.110
"Basically, it
takes a millisecond",01:04:31.110,01:04:35.390
"to traverse a box
that is a fraction",01:04:35.390,01:04:38.530
"of a meter with
these velocities.",01:04:38.530,01:04:42.220
OK?,01:04:42.220,01:04:42.720
You say fine.,01:04:42.720,01:04:44.450
"That is the kind
of timescale that I",01:04:44.450,01:04:46.360
"have in the first equation
that I have in my hierarchy.",01:04:46.360,01:04:50.100
"And that kind of
term is certainly",01:04:50.100,01:04:52.070
"also present in the second
equation for the hierarchy.",01:04:52.070,01:04:56.950
"If I have two particles,
maybe these two particles",01:04:56.950,01:04:59.860
"are orbiting each
other, et cetera.",01:04:59.860,01:05:01.990
"Still, their center of
mass would move, typically,",01:05:01.990,01:05:04.880
with this velocity.,01:05:04.880,01:05:06.569
"And it would take
this amount of time",01:05:06.569,01:05:08.110
"to go across the
size of the box.",01:05:08.110,01:05:11.010
"But there is another
timescale inside there",01:05:11.010,01:05:15.210
"that I would call intrinsic,
which involves dV/dq, d by dp.",01:05:15.210,01:05:25.815
"Now, if I was to see what
the characteristic magnitude",01:05:31.380,01:05:36.770
"of this term is, it would
have to be V divided",01:05:36.770,01:05:42.470
"by a lens scale that
characterizes the potential.",01:05:42.470,01:05:47.730
"And the potential, let's
say, is of the order",01:05:47.730,01:05:50.040
"of atomic size or
molecular size.",01:05:50.040,01:05:52.780
Let's call it d.,01:05:52.780,01:05:54.230
"So this is an atomic
size-- or molecular size.",01:05:54.230,01:05:58.910
"More correctly, really, it's
the range of the interaction",01:06:03.740,01:06:07.240
that you have between particles.,01:06:07.240,01:06:09.730
"And typical values of
these [? numbers ?]",01:06:09.730,01:06:13.280
"are of the order of 10
angstroms, or angstroms,",01:06:13.280,01:06:17.320
or whatever.,01:06:17.320,01:06:18.080
"Let's say 10 to the
minus 10 meters.",01:06:18.080,01:06:19.905
Sorry.,01:06:22.920,01:06:23.480
"The first one I would
like to call tau U.",01:06:23.480,01:06:27.250
"This second time,
that I will call",01:06:27.250,01:06:30.070
"1 over tau c for collisions,
is going to be the ratio of 10",01:06:30.070,01:06:36.414
to the 2 to 10 to the minus 10.,01:06:36.414,01:06:39.950
"It's of the order of 10
to the 12 in both seconds.",01:06:39.950,01:06:45.010
OK?,01:06:45.010,01:06:47.340
"So you can see that this term is
much, much larger in magnitude",01:06:47.340,01:06:54.700
"than the term that was
governing the first equation.",01:06:54.700,01:06:58.584
OK?,01:06:58.584,01:06:59.400
"And roughly, what you
expect in a situation",01:06:59.400,01:07:03.730
"such as this-- let's imagine,
rather than shooting particles",01:07:03.730,01:07:11.840
"from here, you are
shooting bullets.",01:07:11.840,01:07:17.990
"And then the bullets
would come and basically",01:07:17.990,01:07:20.370
"have some kind of
trajectory, et cetera.",01:07:20.370,01:07:23.440
"The characteristic time
for a single one of them",01:07:23.440,01:07:27.360
"would be basically
something that",01:07:27.360,01:07:31.150
"is related to the
size of the box.",01:07:31.150,01:07:33.230
"How long does it take a bullet
to go over the size of the box?",01:07:33.230,01:07:38.170
"But if two of these
bullets happen",01:07:38.170,01:07:40.620
"to come together and
collide, then there's",01:07:40.620,01:07:45.130
"a very short period
of time over which",01:07:45.130,01:07:48.650
"they would go in
different directions.",01:07:48.650,01:07:51.100
"And the momenta
would get displaced",01:07:51.100,01:07:53.690
from what they were before.,01:07:53.690,01:07:55.600
"And that timescale is
of the order of this.",01:07:55.600,01:07:59.600
"But in the situation
that I set up,",01:08:02.910,01:08:05.880
"this particular
time is too rapid.",01:08:05.880,01:08:09.510
"There is another
more important time,",01:08:09.510,01:08:12.480
"which is, how long
do I have to wait",01:08:12.480,01:08:16.880
"for two of these particles,
or two of these bullets,",01:08:16.880,01:08:20.330
to come and hit each other?,01:08:20.330,01:08:23.550
"So it's not the duration of the
collision that is irrelevant,",01:08:23.550,01:08:28.080
"but how long it would be for
me to find another particle",01:08:28.080,01:08:32.450
to collide with.,01:08:32.450,01:08:34.500
"And actually, that is what
is governed by the terms",01:08:34.500,01:08:38.779
that I have on the other side.,01:08:38.779,01:08:41.399
"Because the terms on the
other side, what they say is I",01:08:41.399,01:08:44.600
have to find another particle.,01:08:44.600,01:08:47.270
"So if I look at the terms that
I have on the right-hand side",01:08:47.270,01:08:55.470
"and try to construct
a characteristic time",01:08:55.470,01:08:58.290
"out of them, I have to compare
the probability that I will",01:08:58.290,01:09:02.279
"have, or the density that
I will have for s plus 1,",01:09:02.279,01:09:06.840
"integrated over some
volume, over which",01:09:06.840,01:09:16.080
"the force between these
particles is non-zero.",01:09:16.080,01:09:20.184
"And then in order to
construct a timescale for it,",01:09:23.770,01:09:27.580
"I know that the d by dt on
the left-hand side acts on fs.",01:09:27.580,01:09:32.279
"On the right-hand
side, I have fs plus 1.",01:09:32.279,01:09:35.250
"So again, just if I want
to construct dimensionally,",01:09:35.250,01:09:37.824
"it's a ratio that
involves s plus 1 to s.",01:09:37.824,01:09:44.529
OK?,01:09:44.529,01:09:46.640
"So I have to do an
additional integration",01:09:46.640,01:09:52.569
"over a volume in phase space
over which two particles can",01:09:52.569,01:09:59.410
have substantial interactions.,01:09:59.410,01:10:01.820
"Because that's where
this [? dv ?] by dq",01:10:01.820,01:10:03.710
"would be non-zero, provided
that there is a density for s",01:10:03.710,01:10:09.820
"plus 1 particle
compared to s particles.",01:10:09.820,01:10:13.300
"If you think about
it, that means",01:10:13.300,01:10:15.000
"that I have to look
at the typical density",01:10:15.000,01:10:18.390
"or particles times d cubed for
these additional operations",01:10:18.390,01:10:26.770
"multiplied by this collision
time that I had before.",01:10:26.770,01:10:32.480
OK?,01:10:32.480,01:10:34.300
"And this whole thing I will
call 1 over tau collision.",01:10:34.300,01:10:39.945
"And another way of getting
the same result is as follows.",01:10:42.620,01:10:50.080
"This is typically how you get
collision times by pictorially.",01:10:50.080,01:10:56.190
"You say that I have something
that can interact over",01:10:56.190,01:11:01.320
some characteristic size d.,01:11:01.320,01:11:05.530
"It moves in space
with velocity v",01:11:05.530,01:11:11.640

that I will call tau,",01:11:11.640,01:11:17.050

I'm essentially",01:11:17.050,01:11:19.840
"sweeping a volume of space that
has volume d squared v tau.",01:11:19.840,01:11:28.690

dimension is d, is d squared.",01:11:28.690,01:11:33.000
"I sweep in the other
direction by [? aman ?] d tau.",01:11:33.000,01:11:36.680
"And how many particles
will I encounter?",01:11:36.680,01:11:40.290
"Well, if I know
the density, which",01:11:40.290,01:11:42.130
"is the number of
particles per unit volume,",01:11:42.130,01:11:45.020

to go until I hit 1?",01:11:48.450,01:11:51.930
I'll call that tau x.,01:11:51.930,01:11:54.340
"Then my formula
for tau x would be",01:11:54.340,01:11:57.910
"1 over nvd squared, which
is exactly what I have here.",01:11:57.910,01:12:05.080
"1 over tau x is
nd squared v. OK?",01:12:05.080,01:12:12.280
"So in order to compare
the terms that I",01:12:12.280,01:12:19.020
"have on the right-hand
side with the terms",01:12:19.020,01:12:22.710
"on the left-hand
side, I notice that I",01:12:22.710,01:12:25.850
"need to know something
about nd cubed.",01:12:25.850,01:12:31.210
"So nd cubed tells you
if I have a particle",01:12:31.210,01:12:36.110
"here and this particle has
a range of interactions",01:12:36.110,01:12:40.000
"that I call d, how many
other particles fall",01:12:40.000,01:12:44.950
"within that range
of interaction?",01:12:44.950,01:12:46.370
"Now, for the gas in this room,
the range of the interaction",01:12:49.490,01:12:53.750
"is of the order of the
size of the molecule.",01:12:53.750,01:12:55.680
It is very small.,01:12:55.680,01:12:58.350
"And the distance between
molecules in this room",01:12:58.350,01:13:01.180
is far apart.,01:13:01.180,01:13:03.340
"And indeed, you can estimate
that for gas, nd cubed",01:13:03.340,01:13:10.770
"has to be of the order
of 10 to the minus 4.",01:13:10.770,01:13:14.480
And how do I know that?,01:13:14.480,01:13:16.260
"Because if I were to take all of
the gas particles in this room",01:13:16.260,01:13:20.610
"and put them together so
that they are touching,",01:13:20.610,01:13:24.560
then I would have a liquid.,01:13:24.560,01:13:26.690
"And the density of,
say, typical liquid",01:13:26.690,01:13:29.600
"is of the order of 10,000 times
larger than the density of air.",01:13:29.600,01:13:33.740
"So basically, it has to
be a number of this order.",01:13:33.740,01:13:37.516
OK?,01:13:37.516,01:13:39.960
So fine.,01:13:39.960,01:13:41.355
Let's look at our equations.,01:13:44.180,01:13:47.310
"So what I find is that
in this equation for f2,",01:13:47.310,01:13:53.170
"on the left-hand
side, I have a term",01:13:53.170,01:13:56.570
"that has magnitude that is
very large-- 1 over tau c.",01:13:56.570,01:14:00.850
"Whereas the term on
the right-hand side,",01:14:04.020,01:14:07.280
"in terms of magnitude,
is something like this.",01:14:07.280,01:14:12.210
"And in fact, this will be
true for every equation",01:14:15.420,01:14:17.920
in the hierarchy.,01:14:17.920,01:14:20.420
"So maybe if I am in the
limit where nd cubed is much,",01:14:20.420,01:14:25.570
"much less than 1-- such as
the gas in this room, which",01:14:25.570,01:14:29.950
"is called the dilute limit-- I
can ignore the right-hand side.",01:14:29.950,01:14:34.490
"I can set the
right-hand side to 0.",01:14:34.490,01:14:38.511
OK?,01:14:38.511,01:14:39.010
"Now, I can't do that
for the first equation,",01:14:41.720,01:14:45.380
"because the first
equation is really",01:14:45.380,01:14:47.320
"the only equation in the
hierarchy that does not",01:14:47.320,01:14:50.020
"have the collision term
on the left-hand side.",01:14:50.020,01:14:53.484
Right?,01:14:53.484,01:14:54.950
"And so for the first equation,
I really need to keep that.",01:14:54.950,01:14:59.611
"And actually, it goes
back to all of the story",01:14:59.611,01:15:03.650
that we've had over here.,01:15:03.650,01:15:07.340
"Remember that we said
this rho equilibrium has",01:15:07.340,01:15:11.540
"to be a function of H
and conserved quantities.",01:15:11.540,01:15:16.600
"Suppose I go to my
Hamiltonian and I",01:15:16.600,01:15:20.170
"ignore all of these
interactions, which",01:15:20.170,01:15:24.290
"is what I would
have done if I just",01:15:24.290,01:15:26.710
"look at the first term over
here and set the collision",01:15:26.710,01:15:31.370
"term on the
right-hand side to 0.",01:15:31.370,01:15:34.040
What would happen then?,01:15:34.040,01:15:36.380
"Then clearly, for each
one of the particles,",01:15:36.380,01:15:40.180
"I have-- let's say it's energy
is going to be conserved.",01:15:40.180,01:15:44.480
"Maybe the magnitude
of its momentum",01:15:44.480,01:15:46.330
"is going to be conserved in
the appropriate geometry.",01:15:46.330,01:15:49.450
"And so there will
be a huge number",01:15:49.450,01:15:52.390
"of individual
conserved quantities",01:15:52.390,01:15:55.870
"that I would have
to put over there.",01:15:55.870,01:15:58.300
"Indeed, if I sort of
go back to the picture",01:15:58.300,01:16:00.560
"that I was drawing over
here, if I ignore collisions",01:16:00.560,01:16:04.860
"between the particles, then
the bullets that I send",01:16:04.860,01:16:08.810
"will always be following
a trajectory such as this",01:16:08.810,01:16:13.740
"forever, because momentum
will be conserved.",01:16:13.740,01:16:17.200
"You will always-- I mean,
except up to reflection.",01:16:17.200,01:16:19.990
"And say the
magnitude of velocity",01:16:19.990,01:16:21.760
"would be always
following the same thing.",01:16:21.760,01:16:25.030
OK?,01:16:25.030,01:16:26.380
"So however, if there is
a collision between two",01:16:26.380,01:16:30.050
"of the particles-- so the
particles that come in here,",01:16:30.050,01:16:34.090
"they have different velocities,
they will hit each other.",01:16:34.090,01:16:37.290
"The moment they hit
each other, they",01:16:37.290,01:16:38.810
go off different directions.,01:16:38.810,01:16:41.080
"And after a certain
number of hits,",01:16:41.080,01:16:43.400
"then I will lose all
of the regularity",01:16:43.400,01:16:45.460
of what I had in the beginning.,01:16:45.460,01:16:48.490
"And so essentially,
this second term",01:16:48.490,01:16:54.390
"on the right-hand
with the collisions",01:16:54.390,01:16:57.680
"is the thing that
is necessary for me",01:16:57.680,01:17:00.550
"to ensure that my gas does come
to equilibrium in the sense",01:17:00.550,01:17:06.200
"that their momenta get
distributed and reversed.",01:17:06.200,01:17:09.870
"I really need to
keep track of that.",01:17:09.870,01:17:12.890
"And also, you can see that
the timescales for which",01:17:12.890,01:17:16.350
"this kind of
equilibration takes place",01:17:16.350,01:17:18.800
"has to do with this
collision time.",01:17:18.800,01:17:22.770
"But as far as this term
is concerned, for the gas",01:17:22.770,01:17:28.030
"or for that system of bullets,
it doesn't really matter.",01:17:28.030,01:17:31.570
"Because for this term
to have been important,",01:17:31.570,01:17:35.030
"it would have been
necessary for something",01:17:35.030,01:17:37.510
"interesting to physically occur
should three particles come",01:17:37.510,01:17:41.470
together simultaneously.,01:17:41.470,01:17:44.520
"And if I complete
the-- say that never",01:17:44.520,01:17:47.450
"in the history of this
system three particles will",01:17:47.450,01:17:51.350
"come together, they do
come together in reality.",01:17:51.350,01:17:55.900
It's not that big a difference.,01:17:55.900,01:17:58.800
"It's only a factor of
10 to the 4 difference",01:17:58.800,01:18:00.780
"between the right-hand side
and the left-hand side.",01:18:00.780,01:18:03.290
"But still, even if
they didn't, there",01:18:03.290,01:18:05.290
"was nothing about
equilibration of the gas that",01:18:05.290,01:18:07.990
would be missed by this.,01:18:07.990,01:18:10.910
"So it's a perfectly reasonable
approximation and assumption,",01:18:10.910,01:18:15.710
"therefore, for us
to drop this term.",01:18:15.710,01:18:20.040
"And we'll see that although
that is physically motivated,",01:18:20.040,01:18:23.020
"it actually doesn't resolve
this question of irreversibility",01:18:23.020,01:18:26.980
"yet, because that's also
potentially a system",01:18:26.980,01:18:31.650
that you could set up.,01:18:31.650,01:18:33.130
"You just eliminate all of
the three-body interactions",01:18:33.130,01:18:35.880
from the problem.,01:18:35.880,01:18:37.030
"Still, you could have
a very reversible set",01:18:37.030,01:18:39.330
"of conditions and
deterministic process",01:18:39.330,01:18:42.570
that you could reverse in time.,01:18:42.570,01:18:45.850
"But still, it's
sort of allows us",01:18:45.850,01:18:48.180
"to have something that
is more manageable,",01:18:48.180,01:18:51.250
"which is what we will
be looking at next.",01:18:51.250,01:18:54.340
"Before I go to what
is next, I also",01:18:54.340,01:18:57.270
"mentioned that there is
one other limit where",01:18:57.270,01:19:01.450
"one can do things,
which is when,",01:19:01.450,01:19:04.420
"within the range of
interaction of one particle,",01:19:04.420,01:19:07.580
there are many other particles.,01:19:07.580,01:19:09.930
"So you are in the dense limit,
nd cubed greater than 1.",01:19:09.930,01:19:15.180
"This does not happen for a
liquid, because for a liquid,",01:19:15.180,01:19:18.000
"the range does not allow many
particles to come within it.",01:19:18.000,01:19:22.230
"But it happens
for a plasma where",01:19:22.230,01:19:24.100
"you have long-range
Coulomb interaction.",01:19:24.100,01:19:26.800
"And within the range
of Coulomb interaction,",01:19:26.800,01:19:29.780
"you could have many
other interactions.",01:19:29.780,01:19:32.140
"And so that limit you will
explore in the problem set",01:19:32.140,01:19:36.620
"leads to a different description
of approach to equilibrium.",01:19:36.620,01:19:41.290
It's called the Vlasov equation.,01:19:41.290,01:19:44.210
"What we are going to proceed
with now will lead to something",01:19:44.210,01:19:48.140
"else, which is called--
in the dilute limit,",01:19:48.140,01:19:52.310
"it will get the
Boltzmann equation.",01:19:52.310,01:19:54.306
OK?,01:19:58.766,01:19:59.266
So let's see what we have.,01:20:03.250,01:20:06.925
"So currently, we
achieved something.",01:20:19.200,01:20:26.210
"We want to describe
properties of a few particles",01:20:26.210,01:20:34.140
"in the system-- densities
that describe only,",01:20:34.140,01:20:37.450
"say, one particle by itself
if one was not enough.",01:20:37.450,01:20:41.990
"But I can terminate
the equations.",01:20:41.990,01:20:44.040
"And with one-particle density
and two-particle density,",01:20:44.040,01:20:48.740
"I should have an
appropriate description",01:20:48.740,01:20:51.240
of how the system evolves.,01:20:51.240,01:20:54.730
"Let's think about
it one more time.",01:20:54.730,01:20:57.310
So what is happening here?,01:20:57.310,01:20:59.115
"There is the
one-particle description",01:20:59.115,01:21:02.450
"that tells you how the
density for one particle,",01:21:02.450,01:21:06.580
"or an ensemble, the probability
for one particle, its position",01:21:06.580,01:21:10.430
and momentum evolves.,01:21:10.430,01:21:12.740
"But it requires
knowledge of what",01:21:12.740,01:21:15.300
"would happen with a
second particle present.",01:21:15.300,01:21:19.150
"But the equations that we
have for the density that",01:21:19.150,01:21:23.220
"involves two particles is
simply a description of things",01:21:23.220,01:21:28.020
"that you would do if you had
deterministic trajectories.",01:21:28.020,01:21:32.390
"There is nothing else
on the right-hand side.",01:21:32.390,01:21:35.130
"So basically, all you
need to do is in order",01:21:35.130,01:21:38.930
"to determine this, is to have
full knowledge of what happens",01:21:38.930,01:21:43.240
"if two particles come
together, collide together, go",01:21:43.240,01:21:46.810
"away, all kinds of things.",01:21:46.810,01:21:48.880
"So if you have those
trajectories for two particles,",01:21:48.880,01:21:52.410
"you can, in principle,
build this density.",01:21:52.410,01:21:55.540
It's still not an easy task.,01:21:55.540,01:21:57.480
"But in principle,
one could do that.",01:21:57.480,01:22:00.050
"And so this is the
description of f2.",01:22:00.050,01:22:03.840
"And we expect f2 to
describe processes",01:22:03.840,01:22:09.050
"in which, over a very
rapid timescale, say,",01:22:09.050,01:22:12.960
"momenta gets shifted from one
direction to another direction.",01:22:12.960,01:22:18.200
"But then there is something
about the overall behavior that",01:22:18.200,01:22:23.270
"should follow, more or less, f1.",01:22:23.270,01:22:26.030
"Again, what do I mean?",01:22:26.030,01:22:27.920
"What I mean is the following,
that if I open this box,",01:22:27.920,01:22:33.400
there is what you would observe.,01:22:33.400,01:22:35.720
"The density would kind
of gush through here.",01:22:35.720,01:22:39.060
"And so you can
have a description",01:22:39.060,01:22:40.860
"for how the density, let's
say in coordinate space,",01:22:40.860,01:22:44.480
"would be evolving as
a function of time.",01:22:44.480,01:22:47.590
"If I ask how does the
two-particle prescription",01:22:47.590,01:22:51.630
"evolve, well, the two-particle
prescription, part of it",01:22:51.630,01:22:55.780
"is what's the
probability that I have",01:22:55.780,01:22:57.450
"a particle here and
a particle there?",01:22:57.450,01:22:59.890
"And if the two particles, if
the separations are far apart,",01:22:59.890,01:23:04.120
"you would be justified to
say that that is roughly",01:23:04.120,01:23:06.880
"the product of the probabilities
that I have something here",01:23:06.880,01:23:09.920
and something there.,01:23:09.920,01:23:11.710
"When you become very close
to each other, however,",01:23:11.710,01:23:14.960
"over the range of
interactions and collisions,",01:23:14.960,01:23:17.900
"that will have to be modified,
because at those descriptions",01:23:17.900,01:23:21.510
"from here, you
would have to worry",01:23:21.510,01:23:24.760
"about the collisions, and the
exchange of momenta, et cetera.",01:23:24.760,01:23:28.830
"So in that sense, part of f2
is simply following f1 slowly.",01:23:28.830,01:23:35.610
"And part of f1 captures all of
the collisions that you have.",01:23:35.610,01:23:42.340
"In fact, that part of f2 that
captures in the collisions,",01:23:42.340,01:23:45.600
"we would like to simplify
as much as possible.",01:23:45.600,01:23:49.930
"And that's the next
task that we do.",01:23:49.930,01:23:52.960
"So what I need to do
is to somehow express",01:23:52.960,01:24:02.340
"the f2 that appears
in the first equation",01:24:02.340,01:24:06.630
"while solving this equation
that is the second one.",01:24:06.630,01:24:09.690
"I will write the answer
that we will eventually",01:24:12.870,01:24:15.790
"deal with and
explain it next time.",01:24:15.790,01:24:18.740
"So the ultimate result would
be that the left-hand side,",01:24:18.740,01:24:21.760
"we will have the terms
that we have currently.",01:24:21.760,01:24:23.910
f1.,01:24:33.800,01:24:36.280
"On the right-hand
side, what we find",01:24:36.280,01:24:39.660
"is that I need to
integrate over all momenta",01:24:39.660,01:24:44.240
"of a second particle
and something that",01:24:44.240,01:24:47.320
"is like a distance to the
target-- one term that",01:24:47.320,01:24:53.940
"is the flux of
incoming particles.",01:24:53.940,01:24:56.700
"And then we would have f2
after collision minus f2",01:24:59.580,01:25:11.930
before collision.,01:25:11.930,01:25:12.880
"And this is really
the Boltzmann equation",01:25:18.580,01:25:21.390
"after one more approximation,
where we replace f2 with f1.",01:25:21.390,01:25:26.890
f1.,01:25:26.890,01:25:28.420
"But what all of that
means symbolically",01:25:28.420,01:25:30.730
"and what it is we'll have
to explain next time.",01:25:30.730,01:25:34.780
