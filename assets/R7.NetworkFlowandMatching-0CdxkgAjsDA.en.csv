PROFESSOR: Morning everyone.,00:00:22.570,00:00:23.760
"I hope you all had a
great spring break.",00:00:23.760,00:00:28.130
"And during which I hope
you can have more of 6.046.",00:00:28.130,00:00:33.540
"Today we're going to look at
network flow and two things",00:00:33.540,00:00:37.484
in network flow.,00:00:37.484,00:00:38.150
"The first one is
Edmonds-Karp algorithm,",00:00:44.360,00:00:49.370
"and after that, we're going
to look at two applications.",00:00:49.370,00:00:55.380
"In particular, they are called
bipartite matching and cover.",00:00:55.380,00:01:04.660
OK.,00:01:09.160,00:01:10.010
"So we'll start with
a simpler algorithm,",00:01:10.010,00:01:16.101
which is Ford-Fulkerson.,00:01:16.101,00:01:17.100
"Can someone remind us
what Ford-Fulkerson does?",00:01:24.810,00:01:28.520
Go ahead.,00:01:40.970,00:01:41.966
"AUDIENCE: Every time you
have a augmenting path,",00:01:41.966,00:01:44.456
it gets rid of it.,00:01:44.456,00:01:46.470
PROFESSOR: It gets rid of it?,00:01:46.470,00:01:47.860
Yep.,00:01:47.860,00:01:49.102
"What's your name, by the way?",00:01:49.102,00:01:50.310
AUDIENCE: Michelle.,00:01:50.310,00:01:51.298
PROFESSOR: Michelle.,00:01:51.298,00:01:52.780
OK.,00:01:52.780,00:01:53.610
"So, Michelle gave a
very brief description.",00:01:53.610,00:01:56.600
"But let's be a little
bit more detailed.",00:01:56.600,00:01:58.880
"So we have a graph
network flow G,",00:01:58.880,00:02:02.780
"and the first thing it's going
to do is that given the flow,",00:02:02.780,00:02:06.440
"it will transform G
from a residual graph.",00:02:06.440,00:02:10.660
Everyone remembers that?,00:02:10.660,00:02:12.510
"Then F-F algorithm will find
a path going from source",00:02:12.510,00:02:22.720
"to sink in this residual graph,
and then augment this path.",00:02:22.720,00:02:38.060
"Augmenting just means increasing
the flow on that path.",00:02:42.430,00:02:46.360
By how much?,00:02:46.360,00:02:49.485
"AUDIENCE: The minimum edge
on the path [INAUDIBLE].",00:02:49.485,00:02:53.850
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
minimum edge on the path.",00:02:53.850,00:02:56.480
"Let me just define that to be
the capacity of the path, which",00:02:56.480,00:02:59.980
"is the capacity of
the weakest link.",00:02:59.980,00:03:03.570
OK.,00:03:03.570,00:03:04.200
"Then what's the last
step we're missing here?",00:03:04.200,00:03:08.060
"So after augmenting, our flow
changed from f to f prime.",00:03:16.230,00:03:24.610
"And then we're
going to look back.",00:03:24.610,00:03:28.260
"We have f prime, then Gf
prime, find a path in Gf prime,",00:03:28.260,00:03:31.970
then continue from there.,00:03:31.970,00:03:34.445
"So this algorithm,
in some sense,",00:03:37.200,00:03:39.900
"is not even a very
detailed algorithm,",00:03:39.900,00:03:42.190
"because it doesn't say how to
find a path in the second step.",00:03:42.190,00:03:47.120
"And that's indeed a
problem, because we",00:03:49.815,00:03:51.440
"have seen a pathologically bad
case where each capacity is",00:03:51.440,00:04:06.300
"a billion, and the correct way
to do it is simply augmenting",00:04:06.300,00:04:11.760
"this path and then
that path-- oh sorry,",00:04:11.760,00:04:13.540
"there's edge one--
then we'll be done.",00:04:13.540,00:04:16.790
"But the pathologically
bad case is we keep",00:04:16.790,00:04:20.980
going through this middle edge.,00:04:20.980,00:04:24.322
OK.,00:04:24.322,00:04:24.822
"So Edmonds-Karp is an
improvement to this algorithm.",00:04:24.822,00:04:29.560
Let me just write it here.,00:04:32.520,00:04:33.716
"Its first step, third,
and fourth steps",00:04:42.700,00:04:44.850
are actually exactly the same.,00:04:44.850,00:04:46.230
No change from Ford-Fulkerson.,00:04:46.230,00:04:48.980
"The only thing it does is
that it finds a special path.",00:04:48.980,00:04:54.610
"Did Srini cover
this in the lecture?",00:04:54.610,00:04:58.150
What path Edmonds-Karp finds?,00:04:58.150,00:05:02.717
I see some people nodding.,00:05:02.717,00:05:03.800
OK.,00:05:03.800,00:05:04.060
Go ahead.,00:05:04.060,00:05:04.560
"AUDIENCE: He ran the first
search from the source",00:05:04.560,00:05:08.300
"to the sink in Gf,
take the shortest path.",00:05:08.300,00:05:13.150
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:05:13.150,00:05:13.880
Does everyone agree with that?,00:05:13.880,00:05:16.690
"So Edmonds-Karp finds
the shortest path.",00:05:16.690,00:05:19.190
"From-- I guess, can
you see that part?",00:05:23.180,00:05:29.670
No?,00:05:29.670,00:05:30.170
"Oh, I'm sorry about that.",00:05:30.170,00:05:31.211
Find the shortest path.,00:05:50.170,00:05:53.000
"Here, shortest just means
least number of hops.",00:05:53.000,00:05:56.440
"Here, in this
pathologically bad example,",00:05:56.440,00:05:59.274
"Edmonds-Karp would
do much better,",00:05:59.274,00:06:00.690
"because it would find this path,
instead of this weird path.",00:06:00.690,00:06:05.560
"Because that path,
its distance is 2,",00:06:05.560,00:06:08.560
"and the one going
across the middle is 3.",00:06:08.560,00:06:11.090
OK.,00:06:13.960,00:06:14.460
"Now we're going to prove that
this algorithm runs in order",00:06:14.460,00:06:20.120
VE squared.,00:06:20.120,00:06:20.885
So OK.,00:06:24.580,00:06:25.420
So one step back.,00:06:25.420,00:06:26.670
"Do we have to prove
that is correct?",00:06:26.670,00:06:30.150
"That it indeed finds
the maximum flow?",00:06:30.150,00:06:34.610
"AUDIENCE: No, you don't.",00:06:40.759,00:06:42.604
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:06:42.604,00:06:43.270
"I claim I don't have to
do that, because it's",00:06:43.270,00:06:45.145
"the same thing as
Ford-Fulkerson.",00:06:45.145,00:06:46.900
You can find any path.,00:06:46.900,00:06:49.380
"Now, we want to show-- we
want to bound this run time.",00:06:49.380,00:06:55.280
"So any idea, high-level idea,
how we're going to do that?",00:06:55.280,00:06:59.170
In which several steps?,00:06:59.170,00:07:02.430
OK.,00:07:34.800,00:07:35.300
"So, OK, a simpler question.",00:07:35.300,00:07:39.396
"What's the complexity of this
second step, find the shortest",00:07:39.396,00:07:43.220
path from source to sink?,00:07:43.220,00:07:45.190
Go ahead.,00:07:48.850,00:07:49.810
AUDIENCE: OV plus E.,00:07:49.810,00:07:51.240
"PROFESSOR: OV plus
E. And in this case,",00:07:51.240,00:07:54.280
"actually, V is always less than
E, so I can simply say O of E.",00:07:54.280,00:08:02.310
"Now, how long does it
take to augment that path,",00:08:02.310,00:08:07.210
if we have found it?,00:08:07.210,00:08:09.332
AUDIENCE: O of E.,00:08:09.332,00:08:11.160
"PROFESSOR: O of
E. That's correct.",00:08:11.160,00:08:13.080
"But our claim, we can
also say it's O of V,",00:08:17.110,00:08:23.650
"because the shortest path
at most has three hops.",00:08:23.650,00:08:33.159
"And then, from f
to f prime-- OK.",00:08:33.159,00:08:37.319
"So I think in some sense,
these two are the same steps.",00:08:37.319,00:08:40.140
"Also O of V, and then
updating the rescue graph",00:08:40.140,00:08:43.210
"is also O of V. So one
of these iterations--",00:08:43.210,00:08:47.580
each iteration takes how long?,00:08:47.580,00:08:52.280
AUDIENCE: O of E.,00:08:52.280,00:08:53.279
PROFESSOR: O of E. Right.,00:08:53.279,00:08:54.320
"This is the most expensive
step in one iteration.",00:08:54.320,00:08:59.110
OK.,00:08:59.110,00:08:59.610
"So what else do we have
to do to prove this bound?",00:08:59.610,00:09:02.452
AUDIENCE: Number of iterations.,00:09:02.452,00:09:05.310
"PROFESSOR: We need to show
that the number of iterations",00:09:05.310,00:09:08.470
"is O of V times E.
If we can show that,",00:09:08.470,00:09:21.420
then we are pretty much done.,00:09:21.420,00:09:24.480
OK?,00:09:24.480,00:09:24.980
OK.,00:09:34.900,00:09:35.410
"Now, to prove that
bound, we first",00:09:35.410,00:09:38.000
"need a lemma, which
we call monotonic.",00:09:38.000,00:09:44.275
"So let me define delta f v. This
is the length of the shortest",00:09:48.380,00:10:02.640
"path from s, from
the source, to v,",00:10:02.640,00:10:07.030
"which is a node in a
graph, the length of that",00:10:07.030,00:10:12.580
in rescue graph of f.,00:10:12.580,00:10:15.530
Is that definition clear?,00:10:20.479,00:10:21.520
"And this lemma says delta
f v, for any vertex v,",00:10:27.600,00:10:38.530
does not decrease.,00:10:38.530,00:10:39.500
"So it can only
monotonically increase.",00:10:43.780,00:10:48.245
OK.,00:10:51.396,00:10:51.896
We are going to prove that.,00:10:51.896,00:10:53.020
So we'll prove by contradiction.,00:11:01.630,00:11:04.180
Assume this is not a case.,00:11:04.180,00:11:05.760
"That means there is some
v that in f prime, which",00:11:09.310,00:11:17.040
"is the new residual
graph, its shortest",00:11:17.040,00:11:23.520
"path from the source in
the new residual graph",00:11:23.520,00:11:26.450
is less than the old one.,00:11:26.450,00:11:30.570
Right?,00:11:30.570,00:11:31.070
"We are going to derive
a contradiction to that.",00:11:36.910,00:11:39.236
"So there may be many
such vertices that drop.",00:11:48.590,00:11:53.220
"But if there's any,
I'm going to define v",00:11:53.220,00:12:00.830
"to be the one with
smallest delta in f prime.",00:12:00.830,00:12:15.390
OK.,00:12:22.030,00:12:22.560
Any questions about this step?,00:12:22.560,00:12:23.815
"So there could be like v1, v2,
v3-- that all make this happen.",00:12:30.750,00:12:35.630
"I'm going to choose
the one among those",00:12:35.630,00:12:38.740
"that has the smallest
distance from the source.",00:12:38.740,00:12:42.260
OK?,00:12:48.040,00:12:48.540
Now here is my source.,00:12:51.865,00:12:54.950
"We have a path to v
in graph Gf prime.",00:12:54.950,00:13:03.475
OK.,00:13:07.600,00:13:08.100
So this is a path.,00:13:08.100,00:13:09.070
"Then I can always
find a predecessor,",00:13:09.070,00:13:13.150
which I'll call u here.,00:13:13.150,00:13:14.155
"If this is the
shortest path to v,",00:13:21.460,00:13:23.960
"what can I say about
delta of v and delta of u?",00:13:23.960,00:13:34.630
"What can I say about
these two quantities?",00:13:38.071,00:13:39.820
AUDIENCE: Can v decrease?,00:13:47.925,00:13:50.895
"Can v decrease one
of them, at least?",00:13:50.895,00:13:54.152
"PROFESSOR: This one
is greater than that?",00:13:54.152,00:13:55.860
AUDIENCE: One of them must be--,00:13:55.860,00:13:58.859
"PROFESSOR: One of them is
greater than the other,",00:13:58.859,00:14:00.900
"and that's always true, right?",00:14:00.900,00:14:01.890
For any two?,00:14:01.890,00:14:02.390
AUDIENCE: v is u plus 1.,00:14:06.260,00:14:08.967
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:14:08.967,00:14:09.550
Michelle said v is u plus 1.,00:14:09.550,00:14:11.910
"Does that make
sense to everyone?",00:14:11.910,00:14:13.285
"That's the shortest path
to v. It goes through u.",00:14:21.800,00:14:25.265
OK.,00:14:30.110,00:14:30.610
That's correct.,00:14:30.610,00:14:31.235
"So OK, maybe I wasn't
clear about that.",00:14:36.220,00:14:39.270
"I defined u to be v's
predecessor on the shortest",00:14:39.270,00:14:44.120
path.,00:14:44.120,00:14:46.338
OK?,00:14:46.338,00:14:47.790
"Then definitely delta f prime
of v is delta f prime u plus 1.",00:14:47.790,00:14:56.180
"Now, I'll use u to
be my step stone",00:14:56.180,00:14:59.500
"back to the original graph, f.",00:14:59.500,00:15:02.890
"I want to say something
about this quantity and delta",00:15:02.890,00:15:08.080
u in graph f.,00:15:08.080,00:15:10.357
What can I say about that?,00:15:10.357,00:15:11.440
This is a tricky part.,00:15:34.340,00:15:35.565
AUDIENCE: It's greater than v?,00:15:35.565,00:15:39.160
"PROFESSOR: This one
is greater than that?",00:15:39.160,00:15:41.740
"Or the entire thing
is greater than that?",00:15:41.740,00:15:43.564
OK.,00:15:47.500,00:15:48.000
"I'm going to claim this one is
greater than delta f u plus 1.",00:15:48.000,00:15:55.270
"By which I'm claiming this
quantity is larger than that.",00:15:55.270,00:16:01.030
"Can anyone give a reason
why I can claim that?",00:16:01.030,00:16:05.350
So recall how I defined v.,00:16:10.650,00:16:21.824
"AUDIENCE: Can you repeat
how you defined v?",00:16:21.824,00:16:24.449
PROFESSOR: Good question.,00:16:24.449,00:16:25.490
"So v-- so there are several,
probably several v's that",00:16:25.490,00:16:30.580
"have delta f prime
less than delta f.",00:16:30.580,00:16:34.360
"I'm going to define v to be
the one with smallest delta f.",00:16:34.360,00:16:43.160
"Among all those nodes that have
a job in delta f, in delta.",00:16:43.160,00:16:47.110
This is probably a tricky part.,00:16:51.990,00:16:54.110
"Then by definition, since delta
f u is less than delta f v,",00:16:54.110,00:17:00.560
"right, and I defined v to
be the one with the smallest",00:17:00.560,00:17:07.210
delta that satisfies that.,00:17:07.210,00:17:09.490
"So all the u's-- so u
is a predecessor of v,",00:17:09.490,00:17:12.869
"so u shouldn't be one of
those nodes that have a drop",00:17:12.869,00:17:19.114
in delta.,00:17:19.114,00:17:21.175
"So I know this is
probably a tricky part.",00:17:21.175,00:17:24.722
"Yeah, I'll stop for

"sure we resolve this
part before we move on.",00:17:27.720,00:17:30.430
How many people get it?,00:17:35.480,00:17:38.770
OK.,00:17:38.770,00:17:39.270
Only two.,00:17:39.270,00:17:39.794
That's not good.,00:17:39.794,00:17:40.460
OK.,00:17:40.460,00:17:40.960
"AUDIENCE: I'm
confused about how v",00:17:40.960,00:17:42.815
"can be the one with
the smallest delta f",00:17:42.815,00:17:46.115
"if you have a predecessor
with a smaller delta f.",00:17:46.115,00:17:50.075
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:17:53.527,00:17:54.110
"So v to be the smallest--
the one with smallest",00:17:54.110,00:18:00.520
"f such that delta f prime
is less than delta f.",00:18:00.520,00:18:08.595
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:18:08.595,00:18:09.470
"PROFESSOR: OK, maybe, yeah,
that's why I confused you guys.",00:18:09.470,00:18:13.180
Yeah.,00:18:13.180,00:18:13.680
Sorry about that.,00:18:13.680,00:18:15.550
"So we have a bunch of nodes
who have a drop in delta,",00:18:15.550,00:18:19.080
"and I defined v to be
the one among them that",00:18:19.080,00:18:22.900
has the smallest delta f prime.,00:18:22.900,00:18:24.500
Question?,00:18:27.000,00:18:27.500
"AUDIENCE: Sorry, I'm
lost at what delta",00:18:27.500,00:18:29.125
f prime is versus delta.,00:18:29.125,00:18:31.877
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:18:31.877,00:18:32.460
"Delta f of a node
is the shortest path",00:18:32.460,00:18:37.230
"from source to that
node in G of f,",00:18:37.230,00:18:41.440
"which is the residual
graph given a flow.",00:18:41.440,00:18:44.650
"So f is, well, some
flow, and f prime",00:18:44.650,00:18:49.140
"is the flow after we
augmenting a certain path.",00:18:49.140,00:18:53.870
So f prime is one step after f.,00:18:53.870,00:18:57.901
OK.,00:18:57.901,00:18:58.400
How many people get that now?,00:18:58.400,00:19:01.780
Still not everyone.,00:19:01.780,00:19:02.910
OK.,00:19:08.110,00:19:08.610
Any questions about that?,00:19:08.610,00:19:09.660
"How many people still
haven't got that?",00:19:13.300,00:19:16.200
"OK, so some people-- it's
like Schrodinger's cat.",00:19:19.200,00:19:23.270
It's in the middle state.,00:19:23.270,00:19:24.680
"Well, then I'll have
to move on, and I'll",00:19:34.920,00:19:37.540
assume you all get that one.,00:19:37.540,00:19:40.170
"As the last step, so
of course we will ask,",00:19:44.570,00:19:48.610
"what's the relation between
this guy and delta f of v?",00:19:48.610,00:19:53.530
"Because in the end, we want
to show a contradiction",00:19:56.100,00:19:59.280
"that delta f v is
probably greater or equal",00:19:59.280,00:20:02.180
to delta f of v. OK.,00:20:02.180,00:20:07.524
This is another tricky part.,00:20:07.524,00:20:08.690
"So let me ask maybe a
simpler question now.",00:20:13.195,00:20:16.580
So that is our G of f prime.,00:20:16.580,00:20:19.840
So we also have G of f.,00:20:19.840,00:20:21.500
"It has the source, some u
here, v there, sink there.",00:20:21.500,00:20:28.265
"Does this edge
exist in this graph?",00:20:31.630,00:20:35.940
"So I know if that edge
exists, because I defined u",00:20:38.470,00:20:41.530
"to be the predecessor
of v. But u,",00:20:41.530,00:20:45.555
"v is in that graph doesn't
necessarily mean u,",00:20:45.555,00:20:48.315
v is in the old graph.,00:20:48.315,00:20:49.810
"It could certainly
exist, but is it possible",00:20:53.410,00:20:55.940
that this edge didn't exist?,00:20:55.940,00:20:59.550
"How many people would say
that edge definitely exists?",00:21:02.080,00:21:07.410
"How many people would say
maybe it doesn't exist?",00:21:10.050,00:21:13.045
OK.,00:21:23.320,00:21:23.830
"It doesn't matter, because
we can prove both cases.",00:21:23.830,00:21:26.910
"So let's say case
one, u, v is indeed",00:21:26.910,00:21:35.480
"in the original graph, G of f.",00:21:35.480,00:21:38.402
OK.,00:21:38.402,00:21:38.901
"In that case, can I say
something about that last step?",00:21:38.901,00:21:41.620
"AUDIENCE: It's greater
or equal to delta f v.",00:21:58.945,00:22:03.430
"PROFESSOR: Greater or
equal to delta v. OK.",00:22:03.430,00:22:09.590
Why is that?,00:22:09.590,00:22:10.940
"AUDIENCE: Because v was
on the shortest path.",00:22:10.940,00:22:17.417
Well-- yeah.,00:22:17.417,00:22:19.349
"So the shortest path, either
passed through-- yeah.",00:22:19.349,00:22:25.708
"The shortest path to v either
passed through u or didn't.",00:22:25.708,00:22:28.850
PROFESSOR: Correct.,00:22:28.850,00:22:30.310
Does everyone get that?,00:22:30.310,00:22:31.370
"So the shortest path
in this graph to v",00:22:31.370,00:22:34.490
"is not necessarily
this one, right?",00:22:34.490,00:22:37.890
"But if it's some other
one-- OK, so, in case one",00:22:37.890,00:22:41.430
"I'm assuming this
edge exists, right?",00:22:41.430,00:22:45.449
"Then no matter what
the shortest path",00:22:45.449,00:22:46.990
"is, it's definitely shorter
than I first go to-- from s to u",00:22:46.990,00:22:51.430
and then u to v. Right?,00:22:51.430,00:22:54.650
"The shortest path between s
to v is definitely shorter",00:22:54.650,00:22:58.580
"than I first go from s to u
and then u to v. Make sense?",00:22:58.580,00:23:06.180
OK.,00:23:06.180,00:23:06.680
"So case one, then,
is a contradiction,",00:23:06.680,00:23:12.310
"because we showed that
delta f prime of v",00:23:12.310,00:23:14.680
"is greater or equal to delta f
of v. Any questions about that?",00:23:14.680,00:23:22.410
OK.,00:23:27.180,00:23:27.680
"Case two, u, v is not in Gf.",00:23:27.680,00:23:37.230
"OK, so, how can
that even happen?",00:23:37.230,00:23:41.070
"Is it possible that
this edge didn't exist?",00:23:41.070,00:23:48.760
"AUDIENCE: It could be
a backwards-facing edge",00:23:55.662,00:23:59.113
that you add [INAUDIBLE].,00:23:59.113,00:24:04.102
PROFESSOR: Great point.,00:24:04.102,00:24:05.060
That's exactly right.,00:24:05.060,00:24:06.620
"So it is possible that this edge
didn't exist, but only appeared",00:24:06.620,00:24:12.470
after we go from f to f prime.,00:24:12.470,00:24:15.360
How can that happen?,00:24:15.360,00:24:16.870
"That must mean we are
augmenting a path that",00:24:16.870,00:24:21.240
goes right through it.,00:24:21.240,00:24:22.621
Right?,00:24:22.621,00:24:23.120
"But this edge doesn't exist, so
we cannot be augmenting a path",00:24:23.120,00:24:26.080
that crosses this way.,00:24:26.080,00:24:28.210
"We must be augmenting a
path that goes like that.",00:24:28.210,00:24:35.990
"First from s to v, and then
v to u, and then u to t.",00:24:35.990,00:24:43.910
"If we are augmenting
such a path,",00:24:43.910,00:24:47.270
"then we're going to remove
this edge from v to u,",00:24:47.270,00:24:52.460
"but we will add u to
v to the next graph.",00:24:52.460,00:24:57.420
OK?,00:25:01.810,00:25:02.310
Did everyone get that?,00:25:08.563,00:25:09.880
"So now, here--
well, formally I'm",00:25:22.510,00:25:25.570
"going to claim if we assume
u, v is not in G of f,",00:25:25.570,00:25:29.540
"and we also know u,
v is in Gf prime.",00:25:29.540,00:25:35.640
What does that mean?,00:25:35.640,00:25:37.260
"These two can only
be caused by the fact",00:25:37.260,00:25:43.280
"that u, v is in G of f.",00:25:43.280,00:25:49.500
"Not only in that graph--
it must be on the path",00:25:49.500,00:25:56.060
we are augmenting.,00:25:56.060,00:25:56.870
Make sense?,00:26:05.520,00:26:06.020
OK.,00:26:16.700,00:26:17.200
"So given that, can we say
something about delta f",00:26:17.200,00:26:22.130
of u and delta f of v?,00:26:22.130,00:26:24.040
So here is our p.,00:26:33.520,00:26:36.375
Right?,00:26:36.375,00:26:38.690
This entire thing here.,00:26:38.690,00:26:39.660
And p is the augmenting path.,00:26:48.180,00:26:53.112
"AUDIENCE: And f u
is just f v plus 1.",00:26:53.112,00:26:56.521
PROFESSOR: Correct.,00:26:56.521,00:26:57.312
Right.,00:26:57.312,00:26:57.812
"So if that is the augmenting
path in Edmonds-Karp,",00:26:57.812,00:27:02.300
"we are looking for
the shortest path.",00:27:02.300,00:27:04.030
Right?,00:27:04.030,00:27:05.640
"So v is the predecessor
of u, then delta of u",00:27:05.640,00:27:12.240
is delta of v plus 1.,00:27:12.240,00:27:14.370
"That means that quantity,
here, is delta f of v plus 2.",00:27:14.370,00:27:26.680
OK?,00:27:31.110,00:27:31.610
"So it's also a contradiction
to what we assumed.",00:27:44.440,00:27:49.320
OK.,00:28:02.360,00:28:02.860
"So that proves our
lemma of every node's",00:28:02.860,00:28:07.100
delta monotonically increases.,00:28:07.100,00:28:10.156
"Now here, I'm going to show
that-- our final theorem,",00:28:10.156,00:28:15.740
"that we have at most VE
number of iterations.",00:28:15.740,00:28:20.365
"So the way we're going
to show that is we",00:28:27.290,00:28:35.595
"are going to define a
capacity of the path.",00:28:35.595,00:28:40.530
"It must be the capacity
of its weakest link.",00:28:40.530,00:28:42.790
"We're going to define its
weakest link is u, v. OK?",00:28:42.790,00:28:48.780
"And we're going to
show that u, v--",00:28:48.780,00:28:52.810
"we'll call that critical
edge-- we're going to show u,",00:28:52.810,00:28:58.265
"v can be critical
only O of V times.",00:28:58.265,00:29:08.840
"If that holds for
every edge, then I",00:29:08.840,00:29:11.710
"claim all the edges
combined can only",00:29:11.710,00:29:15.320
be augmented O of VE times.,00:29:15.320,00:29:17.790
"Now, how do we show that?",00:29:28.580,00:29:33.270
"So again, let's assume
we are augmenting",00:29:33.270,00:29:39.975
"a path that goes
through u to v. If we",00:29:39.975,00:29:46.890
"do that, by our algorithm,
we will get rid of this path,",00:29:46.890,00:29:52.490
and have an edge backwards.,00:29:52.490,00:29:57.570
"We go from f to
some other f prime.",00:29:57.570,00:30:01.140
"Now, when can I
augment u, v again?",00:30:03.730,00:30:07.140
"It can only happen
if at some point,",00:30:10.490,00:30:13.910
"I come back to augment the path
going from v to u, because that",00:30:13.910,00:30:19.690
"will eliminate this back
edge, and and adds back",00:30:19.690,00:30:29.930
"our edge u, v. OK.",00:30:29.930,00:30:34.710
Let's see what happens there.,00:30:34.710,00:30:36.815
"Now I'll call this graph
f, this graph f prime.",00:30:40.840,00:30:44.915
"So in f prime, we know we are
augmenting the path from v",00:30:50.100,00:30:54.130
to u.,00:30:54.130,00:30:54.821
Right.,00:30:54.821,00:30:55.320
"The same argument, delta u,
is delta v plus 1 in f prime.",00:30:55.320,00:31:02.800
Correct?,00:31:02.800,00:31:03.300
"And we know this one
doesn't drop, right?",00:31:05.910,00:31:08.980
"So it's greater or equal
than delta f of v plus 1.",00:31:08.980,00:31:16.050
OK?,00:31:16.050,00:31:18.110
"And we also know in f, v
is the predecessor of u.",00:31:18.110,00:31:22.210
"So this one is equal
to delta f of u plus 2.",00:31:24.820,00:31:34.080
What does that mean?,00:31:34.080,00:31:35.100
"It means in between two times
u, v is augmented, delta of u",00:31:35.100,00:31:45.550
must increase by at least 2.,00:31:45.550,00:31:47.200
"Then how large can delta of
a certain node possibly be?",00:31:53.210,00:31:58.210
"It's definitely
bounded by v. So then I",00:31:58.210,00:32:02.240
"claim this particular edge,
u, v, can only be involved,",00:32:02.240,00:32:06.080
"can only be critical
edge, O of V times.",00:32:06.080,00:32:10.030
"Actually, half of V times.",00:32:10.030,00:32:12.320
Strictly.,00:32:12.320,00:32:13.860
"So then, every edge
combined, there",00:32:13.860,00:32:16.610
"can only be half of V times
E number of augmentations.",00:32:16.610,00:32:22.445
OK.,00:32:30.660,00:32:31.160
Any questions about that part?,00:32:31.160,00:32:32.420
About the entire proof?,00:32:32.420,00:32:33.500
"If not, we'll move on.",00:33:11.044,00:33:11.960
OK.,00:33:19.490,00:33:19.990
"This is not part of the
required in the recitation,",00:33:19.990,00:33:22.780
"but I'll quickly say a few words
about an even better algorithm,",00:33:22.780,00:33:27.040
"Dinic, which was in O
of V squared times E.",00:33:27.040,00:33:34.290
"So this is an improvement
to Edmonds-Karp,",00:33:34.290,00:33:37.190
"and its idea is that I'm
going to find all the shortest",00:33:37.190,00:33:46.260
paths in one go from s to t.,00:33:46.260,00:33:50.050
"I'm going to augment all
of them at the same time.",00:33:53.310,00:33:57.320
"Then, because they are all
shortest paths, when I augment",00:34:00.150,00:34:03.900
"that, each path will be broken.",00:34:03.900,00:34:06.580
"Maybe I'll get rid of this
edge, this edge, and that edge.",00:34:06.580,00:34:10.050
"And the thesis is that the
shortest path will increase.",00:34:10.050,00:34:15.540
"So here, the shortest
path is 3, but I",00:34:15.540,00:34:17.650
"have destroyed all the
shortest path of length 3,",00:34:17.650,00:34:20.230
"so I'm going to
shortest path of 4.",00:34:20.230,00:34:23.650
"If they do that, you can
bound the number of iterations",00:34:23.650,00:34:26.469
"to O of V, because your
shortest path can be,",00:34:26.469,00:34:30.409
"at most, V. But each iteration
is slightly more complicated,",00:34:30.409,00:34:35.179
"because you need to find
all the shortest paths,",00:34:35.179,00:34:37.515
"and it happens that
they can show-- you",00:34:37.515,00:34:39.344
"can find it in V times E.
That gives the V square of E.",00:34:39.344,00:34:42.830
That's not the important part.,00:34:42.830,00:34:44.757
"The more interesting
part is that, actually,",00:34:44.757,00:34:46.590
"the author of this algorithm,
his name is Dinitz.",00:34:46.590,00:34:53.658
"But his algorithm is
very hard to understand.",00:34:53.658,00:34:58.006
"Yeah, nobody got that.",00:34:58.006,00:34:59.610
"And there's some other guy
whose name I think is Even.",00:34:59.610,00:35:05.000
"He understood the problem and
started advertising to people",00:35:05.000,00:35:08.290
"and giving lectures
on Dinitz's algorithm.",00:35:08.290,00:35:12.290
"So he popularized the
algorithm, but unfortunately he",00:35:12.290,00:35:15.600
"got the name of
the author wrong.",00:35:15.600,00:35:17.900
"So that's why this
algorithm is henceforth",00:35:17.900,00:35:19.900
called Dinic's algorithm.,00:35:19.900,00:35:22.660
This is useful to know.,00:35:22.660,00:35:24.330
Why?,00:35:24.330,00:35:25.370
"Because you can tell this story
to other people so they will",00:35:25.370,00:35:28.180
"assume that you know a lot
about Dinic's algorithm,",00:35:28.180,00:35:30.520
"while in fact, you
probably don't.",00:35:30.520,00:35:32.396
"And that's exactly
what I'm doing here.",00:35:32.396,00:35:34.020
OK.,00:35:37.611,00:35:38.110
"Now let's look at
one application.",00:35:42.374,00:35:43.790
Bipartite matching.,00:35:50.690,00:35:53.574
OK.,00:35:58.141,00:35:58.640
"So the problem is that
we have several person",00:35:58.640,00:36:04.740
and several tasks.,00:36:04.740,00:36:07.300
"And let me get
rid of one person,",00:36:07.300,00:36:08.675
"because I don't want to
draw that many stuff.",00:36:08.675,00:36:11.440
So we have a graph like that.,00:36:11.440,00:36:15.350
"And each edge-- if
there is an edge, that",00:36:15.350,00:36:19.210
"means this person is capable
of performing that task.",00:36:19.210,00:36:22.680
"And the problem is that--
find the matching, which",00:36:26.030,00:36:29.310
"means the assignment
from people to tasks,",00:36:29.310,00:36:33.660
"such that we get as many
tasks done as possible.",00:36:33.660,00:36:37.830
OK?,00:36:37.830,00:36:38.330
"So one person can
only do one task,",00:36:38.330,00:36:40.130
"and one task only
needs one person.",00:36:40.130,00:36:42.720
"So here you can see
a bad matching, which",00:36:42.720,00:36:45.310
"is I assign this
first guy to task one,",00:36:45.310,00:36:50.100
then no one can do task two.,00:36:50.100,00:36:54.260
"So if I'm smarter, I'll assign
one of these guys to that task",00:36:54.260,00:36:58.210
"and have this person
handle the other task.",00:36:58.210,00:37:01.790
Is the problem clear?,00:37:01.790,00:37:02.715
"So this is called bipartite
graph, because-- well,",00:37:06.040,00:37:10.610
"which means you can partition
a graph into two parts,",00:37:10.610,00:37:13.540
"and within each part,
there's no edge connecting",00:37:13.540,00:37:16.340
any pair of vertices.,00:37:16.340,00:37:18.470
"And you can also define this
problem for a general graph.",00:37:18.470,00:37:22.690
The goal is the same.,00:37:27.650,00:37:29.300
"Find a subset of edges
such that no two edges are",00:37:29.300,00:37:38.870
connected to the same vertex.,00:37:38.870,00:37:44.180
"But we are going to
look at bipartite graph.",00:37:44.180,00:37:49.340
"And we claim in
bipartite graph, this",00:37:49.340,00:37:52.160
can be solved using max flow.,00:37:52.160,00:37:53.975

exactly the same thing as that.",00:42:29.030,00:42:34.920

bipartite graph, is",00:42:38.790,00:42:41.990

several vertices in this graph",00:42:41.990,00:42:50.500

node, at least-- OK,",00:42:50.500,00:42:56.060
"let me color several
nodes in this graph-- such",00:42:56.060,00:43:00.140
"that each edge is connected
to at least one dark node.",00:43:00.140,00:43:04.990

colored, is called a cover.",00:43:08.390,00:43:11.210
I want to find a minimum cover.,00:43:11.210,00:43:14.750
"You can of course cover all the
nodes, that trivially holds,",00:43:14.750,00:43:19.070
"but we are looking
for the minimum cover.",00:43:19.070,00:43:20.850

cover is k if and only",00:43:20.850,00:43:28.890

max matching-- is k.",00:43:28.890,00:43:43.270
Why is that?,00:43:43.270,00:43:44.610
"Because in that matching--
if we have a matching,",00:43:44.610,00:43:50.680

cover them like that.",00:44:20.280,00:44:22.920

Make sense?,00:48:55.450,00:48:57.660
OK.,00:48:57.660,00:48:58.160
So this doesn't exist.,00:48:58.160,00:49:01.100

an unmatched edge.",00:49:01.100,00:49:03.490

about this node?",00:49:03.490,00:49:06.330

one matched edge, because if it",00:49:06.330,00:49:12.230

add this guy into my matching.",00:49:12.230,00:49:17.890

any constraint.",00:49:17.890,00:49:20.040

so, then this guy",00:49:27.080,00:49:30.030
"has to be dark, because
this one is not.",00:49:30.030,00:49:33.410

one become dark?",00:49:33.410,00:49:35.510

other guy on the left, right?",00:49:35.510,00:49:38.020

path going back and forth.",00:49:38.020,00:49:40.460

path, starting from left,",00:49:50.620,00:49:54.010

then unmatch these two edges.,00:50:06.350,00:50:09.230
And that's a larger matching.,00:50:09.230,00:50:13.380
"Because I removed the
two, I added three.",00:50:13.380,00:50:15.331
"That means a max matching of k
leads to a minimum cover of k",00:50:26.400,00:50:35.720
"as well, which also means max
flow of k in our network flow.",00:50:35.720,00:50:41.284
"So this part-- this
equivalence is not required.",00:50:44.450,00:50:46.585
"You should know this proof,
the proof of Edmonds-Karp,",00:50:50.050,00:50:54.730
"and know that a
matching and cover can",00:50:54.730,00:50:57.400
"be solved by network flow,
and that Dinitz's name is",00:50:57.400,00:51:01.380
spelled not as Dinic.,00:51:01.380,00:51:02.925
OK.,00:51:07.601,00:51:08.100
And that's everything for today.,00:51:08.100,00:51:11.104
