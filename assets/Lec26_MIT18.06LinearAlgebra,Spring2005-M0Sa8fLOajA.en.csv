Okay.,00:00:08.750,00:00:09.310
"This is a lecture where
complex numbers come in.",00:00:09.310,00:00:13.070
"It's a -- complex numbers
have slipped into this course",00:00:13.070,00:00:17.160
"because even a real matrix
can have complex eigenvalues.",00:00:17.160,00:00:23.480
"So we met complex numbers
there as the eigenvalues",00:00:23.480,00:00:27.420
and complex eigenvectors.,00:00:27.420,00:00:30.030
And we -- or --,00:00:30.030,00:00:33.560
this is probably the last --,00:00:33.560,00:00:36.410
"we have a lot of other things
to do about eigenvalues",00:00:36.410,00:00:38.870
and eigenvectors.,00:00:38.870,00:00:40.580
And that will be mostly real.,00:00:40.580,00:00:43.610
"But at one point
somewhere, we have",00:00:43.610,00:00:46.090
"to see what you do when the
numbers become complex numbers.",00:00:46.090,00:00:51.140
"What happens when the
vectors are complex,",00:00:51.140,00:00:54.500
"when the matrixes are
complex, when the --",00:00:54.500,00:00:57.360
"what's the inner product of two,
the dot product of two complex",00:00:57.360,00:01:01.640
vectors --,00:01:01.640,00:01:03.730
"we just have to make
the change, just see --",00:01:03.730,00:01:06.050
"what is the change when
numbers become complex?",00:01:06.050,00:01:09.340
"Then, can I tell you about
the most important example",00:01:09.340,00:01:14.360
of complex matrixes?,00:01:14.360,00:01:17.270
It comes in the Fourier matrix.,00:01:17.270,00:01:20.460
"So the Fourier matrix,
which I'll describe,",00:01:20.460,00:01:23.480
is a complex matrix.,00:01:23.480,00:01:25.400
"It's certainly the most
important complex matrix.",00:01:25.400,00:01:28.850
"It's the matrix that we
need in Fourier transform.",00:01:28.850,00:01:34.770
"And the -- really, the special
thing that I want to tell you",00:01:34.770,00:01:37.930
"about is what's called the
fast Fourier transform,",00:01:37.930,00:01:42.340
"and everybody refers to it
as the FFT and it's in all",00:01:42.340,00:01:48.000
computer and it's used --,00:01:48.000,00:01:50.500
"it's being used as we
speak in a thousand places,",00:01:50.500,00:01:54.010
"because it has, like,
transformed whole industries",00:01:54.010,00:01:59.510
"to be able to do the
Fourier transform fast,",00:01:59.510,00:02:03.090
"which means multiplying --
how do I multiply fast by that",00:02:03.090,00:02:09.270
matrix -- by that n by n matrix?,00:02:09.270,00:02:11.730
"Normally, multiplications
by an n by n matrix --",00:02:11.730,00:02:16.380
"would normally be n
squared multiplications,",00:02:16.380,00:02:21.440
"because I've got n squared
entries and none of them is",00:02:21.440,00:02:24.460
zero.,00:02:24.460,00:02:24.960
This is a full matrix.,00:02:24.960,00:02:27.780
"And it's a matrix with
orthogonal columns.",00:02:27.780,00:02:30.700
"I mean, it's just,
like, the best matrix.",00:02:30.700,00:02:34.140
"And this fast Fourier
transform idea",00:02:34.140,00:02:37.700
"reduces this n squared,
which was slowing up",00:02:37.700,00:02:43.680
"the calculation of Fourier
transforms down to n log(n).",00:02:43.680,00:02:47.815
"n log(n), log to the
base two, actually.",00:02:51.000,00:02:54.480
"And it's this --
when that hit --",00:02:54.480,00:02:57.940
"when that possibility hit,
it made a big difference.",00:02:57.940,00:03:01.930
"Everybody realized
gradually what, --",00:03:01.930,00:03:08.430
"that this simple idea -- you'll
see it's just a simple matrix",00:03:08.430,00:03:11.800
"factorization -- but
it changed everything.",00:03:11.800,00:03:15.060
Okay.,00:03:15.060,00:03:15.630
"So I want to talk about
complex vectors and matrixes",00:03:15.630,00:03:19.250
"in general, recap a
little bit from last time,",00:03:19.250,00:03:22.610
"and the Fourier
matrix in particular.",00:03:22.610,00:03:27.450
Okay.,00:03:27.450,00:03:28.940
So what's the deal?,00:03:28.940,00:03:31.360
All right.,00:03:31.360,00:03:32.210
"The main point is,
what about length?",00:03:32.210,00:03:36.500
"I'm given a vector,
I have a vector x.",00:03:36.500,00:03:40.560
"Or let me call it z as a
reminder that it's complex,",00:03:40.560,00:03:44.310
for the moment.,00:03:44.310,00:03:45.260
"But I can -- later I'll
call the components x.",00:03:45.260,00:03:48.950
They'll be complex numbers.,00:03:48.950,00:03:50.740
But it's a vector --,00:03:50.740,00:03:53.090
"z1, z2 down to zn.",00:03:53.090,00:03:56.500
"So the only novelty is
it's not in R^n anymore.",00:03:56.500,00:04:01.590
"It's in complex n
dimensional space.",00:04:01.590,00:04:04.370
"Each of those numbers
is a complex number.",00:04:04.370,00:04:07.510
"So this z,z1 is in C^n, n
dimensional complex space",00:04:07.510,00:04:14.750
instead of R^n.,00:04:14.750,00:04:17.700
"So just a different letter
there, but now the point",00:04:17.700,00:04:20.750
about its length is what?,00:04:20.750,00:04:23.200
"The point about its length is
that z transpose z is no good.",00:04:23.200,00:04:29.190
"z transpose z -- if I just
put down z transpose here,",00:04:34.800,00:04:38.530
"it would be z1, z2, to zn.",00:04:38.530,00:04:42.090
"Doing that multiplication
doesn't give me",00:04:45.580,00:04:47.990
the right thing.,00:04:47.990,00:04:50.090
W-Why not?,00:04:50.090,00:04:51.300
"Because the length squared
should be positive.",00:04:51.300,00:04:57.390
"And if I multiply -- suppose
this is, like, 1 and i.",00:04:57.390,00:05:01.930
"What's the length of the
vector with components 1 and i?",00:05:01.930,00:05:06.560
"What if I do this,
so n is just two.",00:05:06.560,00:05:08.550
"I'm in C^2, two
dimensional space,",00:05:08.550,00:05:11.380
"complex space with the vector
whose components are 1 and i.",00:05:11.380,00:05:16.510
All right.,00:05:16.510,00:05:17.310
"So if I took one times one
and i times i and added,",00:05:17.310,00:05:23.320
z transpose z would be zero.,00:05:23.320,00:05:27.150
"But I don't -- that
vector is not --",00:05:27.150,00:05:29.310
"doesn't have length zero -- the
vector with the components 1",00:05:29.310,00:05:32.030
and i --,00:05:32.030,00:05:33.590
"this multiplication -- what I
really want is z1 conjugate z1.",00:05:33.590,00:05:41.710
"You remember that z1
conjugate z1 is --",00:05:41.710,00:05:46.510
"so you see that first step
will be z1 conjugate z1,",00:05:46.510,00:05:50.370
"which is the magnitude of z1
squared, which is what I want.",00:05:50.370,00:05:56.820
"That's, like, three
squared or five squared.",00:05:56.820,00:06:00.550
"Now, if it's -- if z1 is i, then
I multiplied by minus i gives",00:06:00.550,00:06:11.170
"one plus one, so the component
of length -- the component i,",00:06:11.170,00:06:19.290
its modulus squared is plus,00:06:19.290,00:06:21.731
one.,00:06:21.731,00:06:22.230
That's great.,00:06:22.230,00:06:22.990
"So what I want to do
then is do that --",00:06:22.990,00:06:25.560
"I want z1 bar z1, z2
bar z2, zn bar zn.",00:06:25.560,00:06:30.680
"And remember that -- you
remember this complex",00:06:30.680,00:06:33.210
conjugate.,00:06:33.210,00:06:33.900
So -- so there's the point.,00:06:33.900,00:06:38.270
"Now I can erase
the no good and put",00:06:38.270,00:06:41.030
"is good, because that now gives
the answer zero for the zero",00:06:41.030,00:06:48.800
"vector, of course, but it
gives a positive length",00:06:48.800,00:06:52.590
squared for any other vector.,00:06:52.590,00:06:55.780
"So it's a -- it's the
right definition of length,",00:06:55.780,00:06:58.890
"and essentially the message is
that we're always going to be",00:06:58.890,00:07:04.370
taking --,00:07:04.370,00:07:06.750
"when we transpose, we also
take complex conjugate.",00:07:06.750,00:07:09.400
"So let's -- let's find
the length of one --",00:07:09.400,00:07:13.670
"so the vector one i, that's
z, that's that vector z.",00:07:13.670,00:07:19.890
"Now I take the conjugate of one
is one, the conjugate of i is",00:07:19.890,00:07:23.490
minus i.,00:07:23.490,00:07:24.650
"I take this vector,
I get one plus one --",00:07:24.650,00:07:29.340
I get,00:07:29.340,00:07:29.840
two.,00:07:29.840,00:07:30.339
"So that's a vector and that's a
vector of length -- square root",00:07:33.050,00:07:36.810
of two.,00:07:36.810,00:07:37.740
"Square root of two is the
length and not the zero",00:07:37.740,00:07:40.560
"that we would have got
from one minus i squared.",00:07:40.560,00:07:43.830
Okay.,00:07:43.830,00:07:46.210
"So the message really is
whenever we transpose,",00:07:46.210,00:07:49.250
we also take conjugates.,00:07:49.250,00:07:51.660
"So here's a symbol --
one symbol to do both.",00:07:51.660,00:07:57.300
"So that symbol H, it stands
for a guy named Hermite,",00:07:57.300,00:08:03.890
"who didn't actually
pronounce the H,",00:08:03.890,00:08:06.710
but let's pronounce it --,00:08:06.710,00:08:09.630
"so I would call
that z Hermitian z.",00:08:09.630,00:08:14.040
"I'll -- let me write that word,
Herm- so his name was Hermite,",00:08:14.040,00:08:20.940
"and then we make it into
an adjective, Hermitian.",00:08:20.940,00:08:27.240
So z Hermitian z. z H z.,00:08:27.240,00:08:32.000
Okay.,00:08:32.000,00:08:34.360
"So, that's the --",00:08:34.360,00:08:37.510
"that's the, length squared.",00:08:37.510,00:08:40.730
Now what's the inner product?,00:08:40.730,00:08:43.409
"Well, it should match.",00:08:43.409,00:08:45.000
"The inner product
of two vectors --",00:08:45.000,00:08:49.850
so inner product is no longer --,00:08:49.850,00:08:56.060
used to be y transpose x.,00:08:56.060,00:08:59.230
That's for real vectors.,00:08:59.230,00:09:01.680
"For complex vectors,
whenever we transpose,",00:09:01.680,00:09:04.970
we also take the conjugate.,00:09:04.970,00:09:07.220
So it's y Hermitian x.,00:09:07.220,00:09:12.110
"Of course it's not
real anymore, usually.",00:09:12.110,00:09:14.160
"That -- the inner product will
usually be complex number.",00:09:14.160,00:09:19.610
"But if y and x are the
same, if they're the same z,",00:09:19.610,00:09:24.100
"then we have z -- z H z,
we have the length squared,",00:09:24.100,00:09:29.240
"and that's what we want, the
inner product of a vector with",00:09:29.240,00:09:31.950
"itself should be
its length squared.",00:09:31.950,00:09:35.490
"So this is, like, forced on us
because this is forced on us.",00:09:35.490,00:09:40.230
So -- so this z -- this --,00:09:40.230,00:09:43.750
"everybody's picking
up what this equals.",00:09:43.750,00:09:45.660
"This is z1 squared
plus zn squared.",00:09:45.660,00:09:52.170
That's the length squared.,00:09:52.170,00:09:53.820
"And that's the inner product
that we have to go with.",00:09:53.820,00:09:57.080
"So it could be a
complex number now.",00:09:57.080,00:10:00.560
One more change.,00:10:00.560,00:10:02.790
"Well, two more changes.",00:10:02.790,00:10:04.750
"We've got to change the
idea of a symmetric matrix.",00:10:04.750,00:10:08.780
"So I'll just recap on
symmetric matrixes.",00:10:08.780,00:10:11.870
"Symmetric means A transpose
equals A, but not --",00:10:11.870,00:10:21.610
no good if A is complex.,00:10:21.610,00:10:30.430
So what do we instead --,00:10:30.430,00:10:33.890
"that applies perfectly
to real matrixes.",00:10:37.490,00:10:40.360
"But now if my
matrixes were complex,",00:10:40.360,00:10:42.760
"I want to take the transpose
and the conjugate to equal A.",00:10:42.760,00:10:51.910
"So there's -- that's the --
the right complex version",00:10:51.910,00:10:55.430
of symmetry.,00:10:55.430,00:10:56.780
"The com- the symmetry
now means when",00:10:56.780,00:10:59.470
"I transpose it, flip across the
diagonal and take conjugates.",00:10:59.470,00:11:03.180
"So, for example -- here
would be an example.",00:11:03.180,00:11:07.250
"On the diagonal, it
had better be real,",00:11:07.250,00:11:09.480
"because when I flip it, the
diagonal is still there and it",00:11:09.480,00:11:15.760
"has to -- and then when I take
the complex conjugate it has",00:11:15.760,00:11:18.410
"to be still there, so it
better be a real number,",00:11:18.410,00:11:21.240
let me say two and five.,00:11:21.240,00:11:24.580
"What about entries
off the diagonal?",00:11:24.580,00:11:27.790
"If this entry is,
say, three plus i,",00:11:27.790,00:11:32.200
then this entry had better be --,00:11:32.200,00:11:36.630
"because I want whatever
this -- when I transpose,",00:11:36.630,00:11:40.070
"it'll show up here
and i conjugate.",00:11:40.070,00:11:42.790
So I need three minus I there.,00:11:42.790,00:11:47.000
So there's a matrix with --,00:11:47.000,00:11:51.400
"that corresponds to
symmetry, but it's complex.",00:11:51.400,00:11:55.640
"And those matrixes are
called Hermitian matrixes.",00:11:55.640,00:12:01.550
Hermitian matrixes.,00:12:01.550,00:12:03.170
A H equals A.,00:12:03.170,00:12:06.210
Fine.,00:12:06.210,00:12:08.790
"Okay, that's -- and those
matrixes have real eigenvalues",00:12:08.790,00:12:13.140
"and they have
perpendicular eigenvectors.",00:12:13.140,00:12:15.950
What does perpendicular mean?,00:12:15.950,00:12:18.760
"Perpendicular means
the inner product --",00:12:18.760,00:12:21.760
so let's go on to perpendicular.,00:12:21.760,00:12:23.585
"Well, when I had perpendicular
vectors, for example,",00:12:28.180,00:12:31.410
"they were like q1, q2 up to qn.",00:12:31.410,00:12:37.820
"That's my -- q is my letter
that I use for perpendicular.",00:12:37.820,00:12:41.630
"Actually, I usually --",00:12:41.630,00:12:43.190
I also mean unit length.,00:12:43.190,00:12:45.840
"So those are perpendicular
unit vectors.",00:12:45.840,00:12:49.010
"But now what does
-- so it's a --",00:12:49.010,00:12:51.030
"orthonormal basis, I'll
still use those words,",00:12:51.030,00:12:54.730
"but how do I compute
perpendicular?",00:12:54.730,00:12:58.560
How do I check perpendicular?,00:12:58.560,00:13:00.770
"This means that the inner
product of qi with qj --",00:13:00.770,00:13:07.370
"but now I not only transpose,
I must conjugate, right,",00:13:07.370,00:13:11.510
"to get zero if i is not
j and one if i is j.",00:13:11.510,00:13:20.210
"So it's a unit vector, meaning
unit length, orthogonal --",00:13:20.210,00:13:25.950
"all the angles are right
angles, but these are angles",00:13:25.950,00:13:28.930
in complex n dimensional space.,00:13:28.930,00:13:33.020
"So it's q1, q on-
qi bar transpose.",00:13:33.020,00:13:37.155
"Or, for short, qi H qj.",00:13:39.790,00:13:44.310
"So it will still be
true -- so let me --",00:13:44.310,00:13:46.650
"again I'll create a
matrix out of those guys.",00:13:46.650,00:13:51.230
"The matrix will have these
q-s in its columns, q2 to qn.",00:13:51.230,00:13:56.090
"And I want to turn that
into matrix language,",00:14:00.320,00:14:03.400
just like before.,00:14:03.400,00:14:05.130
What does that mean?,00:14:05.130,00:14:06.690
"That means I want all
these inner products,",00:14:06.690,00:14:08.800
"so I take these columns of
Q, multiply by their rows --",00:14:08.800,00:14:13.920
"so it was -- it used to be Q
-- it used to be Q transpose Q",00:14:13.920,00:14:17.250
"equals I, right?",00:14:17.250,00:14:18.160
This was an orthogonal matrix.,00:14:20.840,00:14:22.535
But what's changed?,00:14:27.100,00:14:30.490
These are now complex vectors.,00:14:30.490,00:14:33.290
"Their inner products are --
involve conjugating the first",00:14:33.290,00:14:37.730
factor.,00:14:37.730,00:14:39.920
"So it's not -- it's the
conjugate of Q transpose.",00:14:39.920,00:14:44.240
It's Q bar transpose Q.,00:14:44.240,00:14:47.050
Q H.,00:14:47.050,00:14:48.590
"So can I call this -- let me
call it Q H Q, which is I.",00:14:48.590,00:14:55.240
So that's our new --,00:14:55.240,00:14:57.260
"you -- you see I'm just
translating, and the --",00:14:57.260,00:14:59.550
"the book h- on one page gives a
little dictionary of the right",00:14:59.550,00:15:07.300

"Of course, C^n is
a vector space,",00:15:17.120,00:15:19.600
"the numbers we multiply
are now complex numbers --",00:15:19.600,00:15:22.650
"we're just moving into
complex n dimensional space.",00:15:22.650,00:15:27.770
Okay.,00:15:27.770,00:15:29.700
"Now -- actually, I have to say
we changed the word symmet-",00:15:29.700,00:15:34.450
"symmetric to Hermitian
for those matrixes.",00:15:34.450,00:15:38.500
"People also change this word
orthogonal into another word",00:15:38.500,00:15:43.300
"that happens to be unitary,
as a word that applies --",00:15:43.300,00:15:52.730
"that signals that we might be
dealing with a complex matrix",00:15:52.730,00:15:56.540
here.,00:15:56.540,00:15:57.320
So what's a unitary matrix?,00:15:57.320,00:15:59.940
"It's a -- it's just like
an orthogonal matrix.",00:15:59.940,00:16:02.960
"It's a square, n by n matrix
with orthonormal columns,",00:16:02.960,00:16:10.800
"perpendicular columns,
unit vectors --",00:16:10.800,00:16:13.970
"unit vectors computed by --

"by remembering that
there's a conjugate as well",00:16:20.010,00:16:23.820
as a transpose.,00:16:23.820,00:16:25.250
Okay.,00:16:25.250,00:16:26.270
So those are the words.,00:16:26.270,00:16:28.520
"Now I'm ready to get into the
substance of the lecture which",00:16:28.520,00:16:32.880
"is the most famous complex
matrix, which happens",00:16:32.880,00:16:38.290
to be one of these guys.,00:16:38.290,00:16:41.500
"It has orthogonal columns,
and it's named after Fourier",00:16:41.500,00:16:50.240
"because it comes into
the Fourier transform,",00:16:50.240,00:16:52.800
"so it's the matrix
that's all around us.",00:16:52.800,00:16:55.380
Okay.,00:16:55.380,00:16:55.880
"Let me tell you what it is
first of all in the n by n case.",00:16:58.450,00:17:05.660
"Then often I'll let n be four
because four is a good size",00:17:05.660,00:17:09.750
to work with.,00:17:09.750,00:17:11.150
"But here's the n by
n Fourier matrix.",00:17:11.150,00:17:13.369
"Its first column is
the vector of ones.",00:17:17.790,00:17:20.319
"It's n by n, of course.",00:17:24.310,00:17:26.319
"Its second column is
the powers, the --",00:17:26.319,00:17:30.420
"actually, better if I move
from the math department",00:17:30.420,00:17:35.370
"to EE for this one half
hour and then, please,",00:17:35.370,00:17:39.910
let me move back again.,00:17:39.910,00:17:42.100
Okay.,00:17:42.100,00:17:43.870
"What's the difference between
those two departments?",00:17:43.870,00:17:46.170
"It's just math starts
counting with one",00:17:46.170,00:17:50.640
"and electrical engineers
start counting at zero.",00:17:50.640,00:17:56.180
"Actually, they're
probably right.",00:17:56.180,00:17:57.840
"So anyway, we'll give
them -- humor them.",00:17:57.840,00:18:00.720
"So this is really
the zeroes column.",00:18:00.720,00:18:05.090
"And the first column
up to the n-1, that's",00:18:05.090,00:18:08.030
"the one inconvenient spot
in electrical engineering.",00:18:08.030,00:18:11.780
"All these expressions
start at zero, no problem,",00:18:11.780,00:18:14.760
but they end at n-1.,00:18:14.760,00:18:16.720
"Well, that's -- that's the
difficulty of Course 6.",00:18:16.720,00:18:24.000
"So what's -- they're the powers
of a number that I'm going",00:18:24.000,00:18:27.750
to call W --,00:18:27.750,00:18:28.660
"W squared, W cubed, W to the
-- now what is the W here?",00:18:28.660,00:18:34.840
What's the power?,00:18:34.840,00:18:36.060
"This was the zeroes power,
first power, second power,",00:18:36.060,00:18:39.000
"this will be n
minus first power.",00:18:39.000,00:18:43.290
That's the column.,00:18:43.290,00:18:45.130
What's the next column?,00:18:45.130,00:18:46.500
"It's the powers of W squared, W
to the fourth, W to the sixth,",00:18:46.500,00:18:51.920
W to the two n-1.,00:18:51.920,00:18:55.870
"And then more columns
and more columns",00:18:55.870,00:18:58.010
"and more columns and
what's the last column?",00:18:58.010,00:19:00.060
It's the powers of --,00:19:02.790,00:19:07.361
let's see.,00:19:07.361,00:19:07.860
"We -- actually, if we
look around rows, w-",00:19:07.860,00:19:10.860
this matrix is symmetric.,00:19:10.860,00:19:12.520
"It's symmetric in the old
not quite perfect way,",00:19:12.520,00:19:17.220
"not perfect because these
numbers are complex.",00:19:17.220,00:19:21.100
"And so it's -- that
first row is all ones.",00:19:21.100,00:19:25.370
"One W W squared up
to W to the n-1.",00:19:25.370,00:19:28.740
"That's the last column is
the powers of W to the n-1,",00:19:28.740,00:19:34.500
"so this guy matches that, and
finally we get W to something",00:19:34.500,00:19:38.841
here.,00:19:38.841,00:19:39.340
"I guess we could actually figure
out what that something is.",00:19:43.060,00:19:46.670
"What are the entries
of this matrix?",00:19:46.670,00:19:48.610
"The i j entry of
this matrix are --",00:19:48.610,00:19:57.490
"I going to -- are you going to
allow me to let i go from zero",00:19:57.490,00:20:00.420
to n minus one?,00:20:00.420,00:20:01.890
So i and g go from zero to n-1.,00:20:01.890,00:20:07.180
"So the one -- the zero
zero entry is a one --",00:20:07.180,00:20:10.870
"it's just this same W guy
to the power i times j.",00:20:10.870,00:20:15.670
Let's see.,00:20:21.960,00:20:22.460
"I'm jumping into formulas
here and I have to tell you",00:20:22.460,00:20:24.690
"what W is and then you know
everything about this matrix.",00:20:24.690,00:20:27.903
"So W is the -- well,
shall we finish here?",00:20:30.960,00:20:34.520
"What was this -- this is
the (n-1) (n-1) entry.",00:20:34.520,00:20:37.890
This is W to the n-1 squared.,00:20:37.890,00:20:41.380
"Everything's looking like a
mess here, because we have --",00:20:41.380,00:20:46.140
"not too bad, because all
the entries are powers of W.",00:20:46.140,00:20:51.890
There -- none of them are zero.,00:20:51.890,00:20:53.830
This is a full matrix.,00:20:53.830,00:20:56.600
But W is a very special number.,00:20:56.600,00:20:59.840
"W is the special number
whose n-th power is one.",00:20:59.840,00:21:08.720
"In fact -- well, actually,
there are n numbers like that.",00:21:08.720,00:21:12.780
"One of them is one, of course.",00:21:12.780,00:21:14.620
"But the one we --
the W we want is --",00:21:14.620,00:21:19.850
the angle is two pi over n.,00:21:19.850,00:21:23.470
Is that what I mean?,00:21:28.060,00:21:29.130
n over two pi.,00:21:29.130,00:21:32.740
"No, two pi over n.",00:21:32.740,00:21:34.310
"W is E to the I and the
angle is two pi over n.",00:21:34.310,00:21:42.540
Right.,00:21:42.540,00:21:43.550
"Where is this W in
the complex plane?",00:21:43.550,00:21:47.590
"It's -- it's on the
unit circle, right?",00:21:47.590,00:21:49.870
"This is -- it's the cosine
of two pi over n plus I times",00:21:49.870,00:21:56.160
the sine of two pi over n.,00:21:56.160,00:21:59.620
"But actually, forget this.",00:21:59.620,00:22:02.840
"It's never good to work with
the real and imaginary parts,",00:22:02.840,00:22:09.050
"the rectangular coordinates,
when we're taking powers.",00:22:09.050,00:22:14.130
"To take that to the tenth power,
we can't see what we're doing.",00:22:14.130,00:22:17.770
"To take this form
to the tenth power,",00:22:17.770,00:22:19.890
"we see immediately
what we're doing.",00:22:19.890,00:22:22.350
"It would be e to
the i 20 pi over n.",00:22:22.350,00:22:26.480
"So when our matrix is full of
powers -- so it's this formula,",00:22:26.480,00:22:30.570
"and where is this on
the complex plain?",00:22:30.570,00:22:32.690
"Here are the real numbers,
here's the imaginary axis,",00:22:32.690,00:22:36.830
"here's the unit
circle of radius one,",00:22:36.830,00:22:40.410
"and this number is
on the unit circle",00:22:40.410,00:22:44.240
"at this angle, which is one
n-th of the full way round.",00:22:44.240,00:22:48.860
"So if I drew, for
example, n equals six,",00:22:48.860,00:22:52.700
"this would be e to the
two pi, two pi over six,",00:22:52.700,00:22:56.490
"it would be one sixth of the way
around, it would be 60 degrees.",00:22:56.490,00:22:59.160
And where is W squared?,00:23:03.250,00:23:06.090
"So I -- my W is e to the two
pi I over six in this case,",00:23:06.090,00:23:13.120
"in this six by -- for the
six by six Fourier transform,",00:23:13.120,00:23:16.760
"it's totally constructed out
of this number and its powers.",00:23:16.760,00:23:22.800
So what are its powers?,00:23:22.800,00:23:24.480
"Well, its powers are on
the unit circle, right?",00:23:24.480,00:23:27.470
"Because when I square a
number, a complex number,",00:23:27.470,00:23:32.680
"I square its absolute value,
which gives me one again.",00:23:32.680,00:23:37.740
"All the powers have --
are on the unit circle.",00:23:37.740,00:23:40.500
"And the -- the angle
gets doubled to a hundred",00:23:40.500,00:23:43.250
"and twenty, so there's W
squared, there's W cubed,",00:23:43.250,00:23:46.180
"there's W to the fourth, there's
W to the fifth and there is W",00:23:46.180,00:23:50.660
"to the sixth, as we hoped, W to
the sixth coming back to one.",00:23:50.660,00:23:57.070
So those are the six --,00:23:57.070,00:24:01.080
can I say this on TV?,00:24:01.080,00:24:02.620
"The six sixth roots
of one, and it's",00:24:02.620,00:24:07.130
"this one, the primitive one we
say, the first one, which is W.",00:24:07.130,00:24:14.560
"Okay, so what -- let
me change -- let me --",00:24:14.560,00:24:17.840
"I said I would probably
switch to n equal four.",00:24:17.840,00:24:21.440
What's W for that?,00:24:21.440,00:24:24.130
It's the fourth root of one.,00:24:24.130,00:24:25.970
W to the fourth will be one.,00:24:25.970,00:24:28.590
"W will be e to the two
pi i over four now.",00:24:28.590,00:24:33.410
What's that?,00:24:38.820,00:24:41.040
This is e to the i pi over two.,00:24:41.040,00:24:43.270
"This is a quarter of the
way around the unit circle,",00:24:43.270,00:24:46.180
"and that's exactly i, a
quarter of the way around.",00:24:46.180,00:24:53.930
"And sure enough, the
powers are i, i squared,",00:24:53.930,00:24:58.660
"which is minus
one, i cubed, which",00:24:58.660,00:25:01.670
"is minus i and finally i to
the fourth which is one, right.",00:25:01.670,00:25:08.780
"So there's W, W squared, W
cubed, W to the fourth --",00:25:08.780,00:25:12.760
"I'm really ready to
write down this Fourier",00:25:12.760,00:25:15.050

just so we see that clearly.,00:25:18.780,00:25:21.790
Let me do it here.,00:25:21.790,00:25:22.890
"F4 is -- all right, one one one
one one one one W -- it's I.",00:25:22.890,00:25:34.760
I squared.,00:25:34.760,00:25:35.590
That's minus one.,00:25:35.590,00:25:36.770
i cubed is minus i.,00:25:36.770,00:25:38.520
"I'll -- I could write
i squared and i cubed.",00:25:41.350,00:25:43.490

"And now I can put in those

from the fact that the columns",00:27:36.970,00:27:39.890
are orthogonal --,00:27:39.890,00:27:41.640

are orthogonal.",00:28:22.850,00:28:26.340

are orthogonal?,00:28:29.130,00:28:30.265
"So the inner product of
that column with that column",00:28:33.480,00:28:38.360
is zero.,00:28:38.360,00:28:41.260

does that --,00:29:04.860,00:29:06.820
let me do two and,00:29:06.820,00:29:07.751
four.,00:29:07.751,00:29:08.250
Okay.,00:29:15.330,00:29:17.260
"What -- oh, I see, yes, hmm.",00:29:17.260,00:29:19.110
Hmm.,00:29:19.110,00:29:19.610
"Let's see, I believe that those
two columns are orthogonal.",00:29:19.610,00:29:30.060
"So let me take their inner
product and hope to get zero.",00:29:30.060,00:29:33.520
"Okay, now if you hadn't
listened to the first half",00:29:33.520,00:29:36.310
"of this lecture, when you
took the inner product of that",00:29:36.310,00:29:39.890
"with that, you would have
multiplied one by one,",00:29:39.890,00:29:42.760
"i by minus i, and that
would have given you one,",00:29:42.760,00:29:48.090
"minus one by minus one
would have given you",00:29:48.090,00:29:51.370
"another one minus I by I would
have been minus I squared,",00:29:51.370,00:29:55.940
that's another one.,00:29:55.940,00:29:56.810
"So do I conclude that the
inner product of columns --",00:30:00.870,00:30:04.240
"I said columns two
and four, that's",00:30:04.240,00:30:05.920
"because I forgot those
are columns one and three.",00:30:05.920,00:30:08.550
"I'm interested in
their inner product",00:30:12.110,00:30:13.670
"and I'm hoping it's zero, but
it doesn't look like zero.",00:30:13.670,00:30:17.570
"Nevertheless, it is zero.",00:30:17.570,00:30:19.090
Those columns are perpendicular.,00:30:19.090,00:30:20.580
Why?,00:30:20.580,00:30:21.500
Because the inner product --,00:30:21.500,00:30:25.390
we conjugate.,00:30:25.390,00:30:26.520
"Do you remember that the --
one of the vectors in the inner",00:30:26.520,00:30:29.150
product has to get conjugated.,00:30:29.150,00:30:31.510
"So when I conjugated, it
changes that i to a minus i,",00:30:31.510,00:30:34.750
"changes this to a plus
i, changes those --",00:30:34.750,00:30:37.900
"that second sine and that
fourth sine and I do get zero.",00:30:37.900,00:30:44.060
So those columns are orthogonal.,00:30:44.060,00:30:46.490
So columns are orthogonal.,00:30:46.490,00:30:49.130
They're not quite orthonormal.,00:30:51.780,00:30:55.630
But I could fix that easily.,00:30:55.630,00:30:58.020
"They -- all those
columns have length two.",00:30:58.020,00:31:02.710
"Length squared is four, like
this -- the four I had there --",00:31:02.710,00:31:07.450
"this length squared, one plus
-- one squared one squared one",00:31:07.450,00:31:10.260
"squared one squared is
four, square root is two --",00:31:10.260,00:31:13.910
"so if I really wanted them --
suppose I really wanted to fix",00:31:13.910,00:31:17.420
"life perfectly, I
could divide by two,",00:31:17.420,00:31:21.300
"and now I have columns that
are actually orthonormal.",00:31:21.300,00:31:26.653
So what?,00:31:33.420,00:31:35.560
"So I can invert
right away, right?",00:31:35.560,00:31:38.040
"O- orthonormal columns means --
now I'm keeping this one half",00:31:38.040,00:31:41.970
in here for the moment --,00:31:41.970,00:31:43.820
"c- means F4 Hermitian,
can I use that,",00:31:43.820,00:31:48.060
conjugate transpose times F4 is,00:31:48.060,00:31:51.620
i.,00:31:51.620,00:31:52.120
So I see what the inverse is.,00:31:56.230,00:31:59.150
"The inverse of F4 is
-- it's just like an --",00:31:59.150,00:32:01.840
an orthogonal matrix.,00:32:01.840,00:32:03.180
"The inverse is the transpose
-- here the inverse is",00:32:03.180,00:32:06.230
the conjugate transpose.,00:32:06.230,00:32:08.990
"So, fine.",00:32:08.990,00:32:10.250
"That -- that tells me that
anything good that I learn",00:32:10.250,00:32:15.000
about F4 I'll know the same --,00:32:15.000,00:32:19.610
"I'll know a similar
fact about its inverse,",00:32:19.610,00:32:21.710
"because its inverse is just
its conjugate transpose.",00:32:21.710,00:32:25.620
"Okay, now -- so what's good?",00:32:25.620,00:32:28.080
"Well, first, the
columns are orthogonal.",00:32:28.080,00:32:30.430
"That's a key fact, then.",00:32:30.430,00:32:33.870
"That's the thing that
makes the inverse easy.",00:32:33.870,00:32:36.670
"But what property is it that
leads to the fast Fourier",00:32:36.670,00:32:40.740
transform?,00:32:40.740,00:32:41.460
"So now I'm going to talk,
in these last minutes,",00:32:41.460,00:32:44.000
"about the fast
Fourier transform.",00:32:44.000,00:32:48.010
What -- here's the idea.,00:32:48.010,00:32:49.290
"F6, our six by six
matrix, will c-",00:32:51.980,00:32:56.030
"there's a neat connection
to F3, half as big.",00:32:56.030,00:33:02.250
"There's a connection
of F8 to F4.",00:33:02.250,00:33:05.200
"There's a connection
of F(64) to F(32).",00:33:05.200,00:33:09.690
"Shall I write down what
that connection is?",00:33:09.690,00:33:12.070
"What's the connection
of F(64) to F(32)?",00:33:12.070,00:33:15.190
"So F(64) is a 64 by
64 matrix whose W",00:33:15.190,00:33:22.950
is the 64th root of one.,00:33:22.950,00:33:26.500
"So it's one 64th of
the way round in F(64).",00:33:26.500,00:33:31.870
"And it -- do- and F(32)
is a 32 by 32 matrix.",00:33:31.870,00:33:35.959
"Remember, they're
different sizes.",00:33:35.959,00:33:37.375
"And the W in that 32 by 32
matrix is the 32nd root of one,",00:33:40.450,00:33:45.680
"which is twice as far -- that
-- you sh- see that key point --",00:33:45.680,00:33:50.220
"that's the -- that's how 32
and 64 are connected in the Ws.",00:33:50.220,00:33:55.850
"The W for 64 is one
64th of the way --",00:33:55.850,00:33:59.380
"so all I'm saying is
that if I square the W --",00:33:59.380,00:34:05.610
"W(64), that's what I'm using
for the one over -- the --",00:34:05.610,00:34:09.219
"W sixty f- this Wn is either
the i two pi over n --",00:34:09.219,00:34:15.070
"so W(64) is one 64th
of the way around it.",00:34:15.070,00:34:18.690
"When I square that,
what do I get but W(32)?",00:34:18.690,00:34:24.139
Right?,00:34:24.139,00:34:25.969
"If I square this matrix,
I double the angle --",00:34:25.969,00:34:31.060
"if I square this number, I
double the angle, I get, the --",00:34:31.060,00:34:36.300
the W(32).,00:34:36.300,00:34:40.120
"So somehow there's
a little hope here",00:34:40.120,00:34:43.239
to connect F(64) with F(32).,00:34:43.239,00:34:46.440
And here's the connection.,00:34:46.440,00:34:49.400
Okay.,00:34:49.400,00:34:49.980
"Let me -- let me go back, --",00:34:49.980,00:34:53.530
"yes, let me --",00:34:53.530,00:34:54.170
I'll do it here.,00:34:54.170,00:34:58.780
Here's the connection.,00:34:58.780,00:35:00.520
F(64).,00:35:00.520,00:35:01.780
"The 64 by 64 Fourier
matrix is connected",00:35:01.780,00:35:06.530
to two copies of F(32).,00:35:06.530,00:35:10.070
"Let me leave a little
space for the connection.",00:35:10.070,00:35:13.120
So this is 64 by 64.,00:35:13.120,00:35:15.990
"Here's a matrix
of that same size,",00:35:15.990,00:35:18.980
"because it's got two copies of
F(32) and two zero matrixes.",00:35:18.980,00:35:25.640
"Those zero matrixes are the key,
because when I multiply by this",00:35:25.640,00:35:31.500
"matrix, just as it is, regular
multiplication, I would take --",00:35:31.500,00:35:35.570
need 64 --,00:35:35.570,00:35:37.160
"I would -- I would have 64
squared little multiplications",00:35:37.160,00:35:40.320
to do.,00:35:40.320,00:35:41.470
But this matrix is half zero.,00:35:41.470,00:35:45.000
"Well, of course, the
two aren't equal.",00:35:45.000,00:35:46.600
"I'm going to put an equals sign,
but there has to be some fix up",00:35:46.600,00:35:52.010
factors --,00:35:52.010,00:35:53.570
one there and one there --,00:35:53.570,00:35:57.640
to make it true.,00:35:57.640,00:36:00.620
"The beauty is that these fix
up factors will be really --",00:36:00.620,00:36:05.260
almost all zeroes.,00:36:05.260,00:36:07.550
"So that as soon as we
get this formula right,",00:36:07.550,00:36:11.470
"we've got a great idea for
how to get from the sixty-",00:36:11.470,00:36:15.670
"from the 64 squared calculations
-- so this original --",00:36:15.670,00:36:21.180
"originally we have 64 squared
calculations from there,",00:36:21.180,00:36:25.110
"but this one will give us
-- this is -- this will --",00:36:25.110,00:36:29.570
"we don't need that many -- we
only need two times 32 squared,",00:36:29.570,00:36:34.660
because we've got that twice.,00:36:34.660,00:36:38.120
And -- plus the fix-up.,00:36:38.120,00:36:42.440
"So I have to tell you what's
in this fix-up matrix.",00:36:42.440,00:36:47.570
"The one on the right is
actually a permutation matrix,",00:36:47.570,00:36:50.370
"a very simple odds and evens
permutation matrix, the --",00:36:50.370,00:36:55.820
ones show up --,00:36:55.820,00:36:58.260
"I haven't put enough
ones, I really need a --",00:36:58.260,00:37:00.820
"32 of these guys at --
double space and then --",00:37:00.820,00:37:05.106
"you see it's -- it's
a permutation matrix.",00:37:09.210,00:37:12.400
What it does --,00:37:12.400,00:37:14.070
"shall I call it P for
permutation matrix?",00:37:14.070,00:37:18.430
"So what that P does when
it multiplies a vector,",00:37:18.430,00:37:23.920
"it takes the odd -- the even
numbered components first",00:37:23.920,00:37:28.770
and then the odds.,00:37:28.770,00:37:30.580
"You see this -- this one
skipping every time is going",00:37:30.580,00:37:33.640
"to pick out x0, x2, x4, x6 and
then below that will come --",00:37:33.640,00:37:40.260
"will pick out x1, x3, x5.",00:37:40.260,00:37:42.335
"And of course, that can be
hard wired in the computer",00:37:45.850,00:37:49.650
to be instantaneous.,00:37:49.650,00:37:52.350
"So that says -- so
far, what have we said?",00:37:52.350,00:37:56.570
"We're saying that the 64 by
64 Fourier matrix is really",00:37:56.570,00:38:00.960
"separated into -- separate
your vector into the odd --",00:38:00.960,00:38:04.540
"into the even components
and the odd components,",00:38:04.540,00:38:07.430
"then do a 32 size Fourier
transform onto those",00:38:07.430,00:38:12.820
"separately, and then put
the pieces together again.",00:38:12.820,00:38:17.420
"So the pieces -- putting them
together turns them out to be I",00:38:17.420,00:38:21.890
"and a diagonal matrix
and I and a minus,",00:38:21.890,00:38:25.350
that same diagonal matrix.,00:38:25.350,00:38:26.615
"So the fix-up cost is really
the cost of multiplying by D,",00:38:29.330,00:38:33.540
"this diagonal matrix, because
there's essentially no cost",00:38:33.540,00:38:38.120
in --,00:38:38.120,00:38:39.020
"in the I part or in
the permutation part,",00:38:39.020,00:38:42.630
"so really it's -- the fix-up
cost is essentially because D",00:38:42.630,00:38:50.720
is diagonal --,00:38:50.720,00:38:52.950
is 32 multiplications.,00:38:52.950,00:38:54.160
"That's the -- there
you're seeing --",00:38:58.930,00:39:00.430
"of course we didn't check the
formula or we didn't even say",00:39:00.430,00:39:02.888
"what D is yet, but I will --",00:39:02.888,00:39:05.030
"this diagonal matrix
D is powers of W --",00:39:05.030,00:39:08.900
"one W W squared down
to W to the 31st.",00:39:08.900,00:39:13.345
"So you see that when I --
to do a multiplication by D,",00:39:19.720,00:39:22.630
I need to do 32 multiplications.,00:39:22.630,00:39:25.920
There they are.,00:39:25.920,00:39:27.780
"Then -- but the other, the more
serious work is to do the F(32)",00:39:27.780,00:39:33.030
twice on the --,00:39:33.030,00:39:34.910
"separately on the
even numbered and odd",00:39:34.910,00:39:37.300
"numbered components,
so twice 32 squared.",00:39:37.300,00:39:41.600
So 64 squared is gone now.,00:39:41.600,00:39:45.970
And that's the new count.,00:39:45.970,00:39:47.990
"Okay, great, but what next?",00:39:50.580,00:39:54.500
"So that's -- I -- we
now have the key idea --",00:39:54.500,00:39:58.730
"we would have to
check the algebra,",00:39:58.730,00:40:01.110
"but it's just checking a lot of
sums that come out correctly.",00:40:01.110,00:40:06.770
"This is right -- the right
way to see the fast Fourier",00:40:06.770,00:40:10.290
"transform, or one
right way to see it.",00:40:10.290,00:40:15.010
"Then you've got to see
what's the next idea.",00:40:15.010,00:40:17.240
"The next idea is to
break the 32s down.",00:40:17.240,00:40:21.390
Break those 32s down.,00:40:21.390,00:40:23.450
"So we have this factor,
and now we have the F(32),",00:40:23.450,00:40:27.430
"but that breaks into
some guy here --",00:40:27.430,00:40:32.630
F thirty- F six- F(16) --,00:40:32.630,00:40:36.510
F(16).,00:40:36.510,00:40:37.610
"Each -- each F(32) is breaking
into two copies of F(16),",00:40:37.610,00:40:43.320
"and then we have a
permutation and then the --",00:40:43.320,00:40:47.950
"so this is a -- like, this
was a 64 size permutation,",00:40:47.950,00:40:52.210
this is a 32 size permutation --,00:40:52.210,00:40:55.410
I guess I've got it twice.,00:40:55.410,00:40:57.252
So it's -- I'm --,00:40:57.252,00:40:57.960
"I'm just using the same
idea recursively --",00:40:57.960,00:41:01.120
"recursion is the key word --
that on each of those F(32)s --",00:41:01.120,00:41:05.270
"so here's zero zero -- it's
just -- to get F(32) --",00:41:05.270,00:41:09.465
"this is the odd
even permutations --",00:41:13.810,00:41:16.980
"so you see, we're --
the combination of those",00:41:16.980,00:41:20.580
"permutations, what's it doing?",00:41:20.580,00:41:24.210
"This guy separates into odds
-- in -- into evens and odds,",00:41:24.210,00:41:28.070
"and then this guy separates
the evens into the ones --",00:41:28.070,00:41:34.160
"the numbers that are
mult- the even evens,",00:41:34.160,00:41:37.430
"which means zero
four eight sixteen --",00:41:37.430,00:41:41.080
"and even odds, which means
two, six, ten, fourteen --",00:41:41.080,00:41:48.580
and then odd evens and odd odds.,00:41:48.580,00:41:52.240
"You see, together these
permutations then break it --",00:41:52.240,00:41:55.930
"break our vector down into
x, even even and three other",00:41:55.930,00:42:00.630
pieces.,00:42:00.630,00:42:02.090
"Those are the four pieces
that separately get multiplied",00:42:02.090,00:42:05.070
by F(16) --,00:42:05.070,00:42:06.650
"separately fixed up by these Is
and Ds and Is and minus Ds --",00:42:06.650,00:42:12.808
so this count is now reduced.,00:42:15.680,00:42:19.340
"This count is now --
what's it reduced to?",00:42:19.340,00:42:23.220
"So that's going to be gone,
because 32 squared -- that's --",00:42:23.220,00:42:28.490
"that's the change
I'm making, right?",00:42:28.490,00:42:30.680
"The 32 squared -- w- so -- so
it's this that's now reduced.",00:42:30.680,00:42:35.130
"So I still have two times it,
but now what's 32 squared?",00:42:35.130,00:42:40.150
"It's gone in favor of two
sixteen squareds plus sixteen.",00:42:40.150,00:42:47.710
"That's -- and then the
original 32 to fix.",00:42:47.710,00:42:54.055
Maybe you see what's happening.,00:43:00.170,00:43:01.910
"Even easier than this
formula is w- what's --",00:43:01.910,00:43:04.580
"when I do the recursion
more and more times,",00:43:04.580,00:43:09.410
"I get simpler and simpler
factors in the middle.",00:43:09.410,00:43:12.670
"Eventually I'll be down
to two point or one point",00:43:12.670,00:43:15.330
Fourier transforms.,00:43:15.330,00:43:18.320
"But I get more and more
factors piling up on the right",00:43:18.320,00:43:21.170
and left.,00:43:21.170,00:43:21.720
"On the right, I'm just
getting permutation",00:43:21.720,00:43:23.650
matrixes.,00:43:23.650,00:43:24.450
"On the left, I'm getting
these guys, these Is and Ds,",00:43:24.450,00:43:29.300
"so that there was
a 32 there and --",00:43:29.300,00:43:32.490
each one of these is costing 32.,00:43:32.490,00:43:35.320
"Each one of those is costing
And how many will there be?",00:43:35.320,00:43:39.330
"So you see the 32
for this original fix",00:43:42.450,00:43:45.080
"up, because D had 32
numbers, 32 for this next fix",00:43:45.080,00:43:49.850
"up, because D has
16 and 16 more.",00:43:49.850,00:43:54.750
I keep going.,00:43:54.750,00:43:56.920
"So the count in the
middle goes down to zip,",00:43:56.920,00:44:00.320
"but these fix up counts
are all that I'm left with,",00:44:00.320,00:44:04.080
"and how many factors -- how many
fix-ups have I got -- log in --",00:44:04.080,00:44:10.820
"from 64, one step to 32, one
step to 16, one step to eight,",00:44:10.820,00:44:15.740
"four, two and one.",00:44:15.740,00:44:17.660
Six steps.,00:44:17.660,00:44:19.030
So I have six fix-up --,00:44:19.030,00:44:20.550
six fix up factors.,00:44:20.550,00:44:23.540
"Finally I get to six times
the That's my final count.",00:44:23.540,00:44:33.380
"Instead of 64 squared, this is
log to the base two of 64 times",00:44:33.380,00:44:41.430
64 --,00:44:41.430,00:44:42.960
"actually, half of 64.",00:44:42.960,00:44:45.190
"So actually, the final count is
n log to the base two of n --",00:44:45.190,00:44:51.600
that's the 32 --,00:44:51.600,00:44:52.815
a half.,00:44:55.380,00:44:57.430
"So can I put a box
around that wonderful,",00:44:57.430,00:45:02.160
"extremely important and
satisfying conclusion --",00:45:02.160,00:45:07.210
"that the fast Fourier transform
multiplies by an n by n matrix,",00:45:07.210,00:45:12.400
"but it does it not in n
squared steps, but in one",00:45:12.400,00:45:16.110
half n log n steps.,00:45:16.110,00:45:19.100
And if we just --,00:45:19.100,00:45:21.130
"complete by doing a
count, let's suppose --",00:45:21.130,00:45:25.070
"suppose -- a typical
case would be two to the",00:45:25.070,00:45:31.680
tenth.,00:45:31.680,00:45:32.180
"Now n squared is
bigger than a million.",00:45:35.540,00:45:39.760
"So it's a thousand twenty four
times a thousand twenty four.",00:45:44.560,00:45:47.910
"But what is n --
what is one half --",00:45:47.910,00:45:51.390
"what is the new count,
done the right way?",00:45:51.390,00:45:55.690
"It's n -- the thousand
twenty four times one half,",00:45:55.690,00:46:02.550
and what's the logarithm?,00:46:02.550,00:46:04.640
It's ten.,00:46:04.640,00:46:06.180
So times ten over two.,00:46:06.180,00:46:08.540
"So it's five times -- it's five
times a thousand twenty four,",00:46:08.540,00:46:12.880
"where this one was a thousand
twenty four times a thousand",00:46:12.880,00:46:16.690
twenty four.,00:46:16.690,00:46:17.460
"We've reduced the calculation
by a factor of 200 just",00:46:21.450,00:46:25.470
"by factoring the
matrix properly.",00:46:25.470,00:46:28.830
"This was a thousand times n,
we're now down to five times n.",00:46:28.830,00:46:34.580
"So we can do 200
Fourier transforms,",00:46:34.580,00:46:38.570
"where before we
could do one, and",00:46:38.570,00:46:42.160
"in real scientific calculations
where Fourier transforms are",00:46:42.160,00:46:45.720
"happening all the
time, we're saving",00:46:45.720,00:46:48.200
"a factor of in one
of the major steps",00:46:48.200,00:46:52.120
of modern scientific computing.,00:46:52.120,00:46:55.960
"So that's the idea of the
fast Fourier transform,",00:46:55.960,00:46:58.280
"and you see the
whole thing hinged",00:46:58.280,00:47:00.020
"on being a special matrix
with orthonormal columns.",00:47:00.020,00:47:07.360
"Okay, that's actually
it for complex numbers.",00:47:07.360,00:47:13.020
I'm back next time really to --,00:47:13.020,00:47:16.960
"to real numbers,
eigenvalues and eigenvectors",00:47:16.960,00:47:22.560
"and the key idea of
positive definite matrixes",00:47:22.560,00:47:27.190
is going to show up.,00:47:27.190,00:47:28.790
"What's a positive
definite matrix?",00:47:28.790,00:47:30.660
"And it's terrific
that this course",00:47:30.660,00:47:32.550
"is going to reach
positive definiteness,",00:47:32.550,00:47:35.520
"because those are
the matrixes that you",00:47:35.520,00:47:37.840
see the most in applications.,00:47:37.840,00:47:40.320
