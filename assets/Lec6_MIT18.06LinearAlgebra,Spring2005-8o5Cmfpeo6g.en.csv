Okay.,00:00:09.070,00:00:09.660
"This is lecture six
in linear algebra,",00:00:09.660,00:00:13.950
"and we're at the start of this
new chapter, chapter three",00:00:13.950,00:00:19.790
"in the text, which
is really getting",00:00:19.790,00:00:22.500
to the center of linear algebra.,00:00:22.500,00:00:24.930
"And I had time to make
a first start on it",00:00:24.930,00:00:31.460
at the end of lecture five.,00:00:31.460,00:00:33.690
"But now is lecture
six is officially",00:00:33.690,00:00:38.430
"the lecture on vector
spaces and subspaces.",00:00:38.430,00:00:42.610
"And then especially --
there are two subspaces that",00:00:42.610,00:00:47.070
we're specially interested in.,00:00:47.070,00:00:49.840
"One is the column
space of a matrix,",00:00:49.840,00:00:52.680
"the other is the null
space of the matrix.",00:00:52.680,00:00:55.630
"So, I got to tell
you what those are.",00:00:55.630,00:00:59.050
Okay.,00:00:59.050,00:01:00.140
"So, first to remember
from lecture five,",00:01:00.140,00:01:05.140
what is a vector space?,00:01:05.140,00:01:08.350
"It's a bunch of vectors
that -- where I'm allowed --",00:01:08.350,00:01:14.410
where I can add --,00:01:14.410,00:01:15.970
"I can add any two
vectors in the space",00:01:15.970,00:01:19.690
"and the answer
stays in the space.",00:01:19.690,00:01:23.300
"Or I can multiply any vector
in the space by any constant",00:01:23.300,00:01:27.610
"and the result
stays in the space.",00:01:27.610,00:01:30.870
"So that's -- in fact if I
combine those two into one,",00:01:30.870,00:01:34.950
"you can see that -- if I can add
and I can multiply by numbers,",00:01:34.950,00:01:40.710
"that really means that I can
take linear combinations.",00:01:40.710,00:01:44.750
"So the quick way to say it is
that all linear combinations,",00:01:44.750,00:01:50.220
"C -- any multiple of V
plus any multiple of W stay",00:01:50.220,00:01:54.250
in the space.,00:01:54.250,00:01:56.220
"So, can I give you examples
that are vector spaces and also",00:01:56.220,00:02:01.070
"some examples that are not,
to make that point clear?",00:02:01.070,00:02:04.850
"So, suppose I'm in
three dimensions.",00:02:04.850,00:02:10.220
"Then one way to get us one space
is the whole three dimensional",00:02:10.220,00:02:16.950
space.,00:02:16.950,00:02:18.200
"So the whole space R^3,
three dimensional space,",00:02:18.200,00:02:22.770
"would be a vector space, because
if I have a couple of vectors I",00:02:22.770,00:02:27.100
"can add them and I'm certainly
okay and they follow all",00:02:27.100,00:02:30.040
the rules.,00:02:30.040,00:02:32.240
So R^3 is easy.,00:02:32.240,00:02:34.600
"Now I'm interested
also in subspaces.",00:02:34.600,00:02:39.320
"So there's this key
word, subspaces.",00:02:39.320,00:02:42.370
"That's a space -- that's some
vectors inside the given space,",00:02:42.370,00:02:48.530
"inside R three that still make
up a vector space of their own.",00:02:48.530,00:02:53.940
"It's a vector space
inside a vector space.",00:02:53.940,00:02:56.990
"And the simplest
example was a plane.",00:02:56.990,00:03:00.030
"So, like, can I just sketch
it -- there is a plane.",00:03:00.030,00:03:05.070
"It's got to go
through the origin,",00:03:05.070,00:03:07.280
"and of course it
goes infinitely far.",00:03:07.280,00:03:10.390
That's of that's a subspace now.,00:03:10.390,00:03:12.620
"Do you see that if I have
two vectors on the plane",00:03:12.620,00:03:18.190
"and I add them, the
result stays in the plane.",00:03:18.190,00:03:22.920
"If I take a vector in the plane
and I multiply by minus two,",00:03:22.920,00:03:26.770
I'm still in the plane.,00:03:26.770,00:03:28.520
So that plane is a subspace.,00:03:28.520,00:03:31.240
So let me just make that point.,00:03:31.240,00:03:33.120
"Plane through zero, through that
zero zero zero is a subspace.",00:03:33.120,00:03:44.120
Okay.,00:03:44.120,00:03:45.060
"And also, another
subspace would be a line.",00:03:45.060,00:03:51.710
"A line through zero
zero zero -- yeah,",00:03:51.710,00:03:54.230
"the line has to go
through the origin.",00:03:54.230,00:03:56.240
"All subspaces have got
to contain the origin,",00:03:56.240,00:03:59.390
contain zero -- the zero vector.,00:03:59.390,00:04:01.910
So this line is a subspace.,00:04:01.910,00:04:07.015
"Really, if I want to
say it really correctly,",00:04:09.900,00:04:13.910
I should say a subspace of R^3.,00:04:13.910,00:04:18.899
"That of R^3 was, like,
understood there.",00:04:18.899,00:04:23.710
"Now -- so let me call this plane
P. And let me call this line L.",00:04:23.710,00:04:30.730
"And let me ask you about
other sets of vectors.",00:04:30.730,00:04:40.540
Suppose I took --,00:04:40.540,00:04:43.210
"yeah -- so here's
a first question.",00:04:43.210,00:04:45.310
"Suppose I take two
subspaces, like P and L.",00:04:45.310,00:04:50.030
"And I just put them
together, take their union,",00:04:50.030,00:04:54.610
take all the vectors --,00:04:54.610,00:04:56.890
"so now you've got P
and L in mind, here.",00:04:56.890,00:05:00.880
So I have two subspaces.,00:05:00.880,00:05:03.870
"I have two subspaces
and, for example, P --",00:05:03.870,00:05:09.960
a plane and L a line.,00:05:09.960,00:05:12.070
Okay.,00:05:12.070,00:05:13.410
"Now I want to ask you
about the union of those.",00:05:13.410,00:05:17.970
So P union L.,00:05:17.970,00:05:20.190
"This is all vectors
in P or L or both.",00:05:20.190,00:05:29.990
Is that a subspace?,00:05:33.120,00:05:36.240
Is this a subspace?,00:05:36.240,00:05:38.040
This is or is not a subspace?,00:05:38.040,00:05:48.380
"Because we're -- I just want
to be sure that I've got",00:05:48.380,00:05:51.690
the central idea.,00:05:51.690,00:05:54.340
"Suppose I take the
vectors in the plane",00:05:54.340,00:05:57.200
"and also the vectors
on that line,",00:05:57.200,00:06:03.230
"put them together, so I've
got a bunch of vectors,",00:06:03.230,00:06:05.930
is it a subspace?,00:06:05.930,00:06:07.030
"Can you give me,
like, so the camera",00:06:07.030,00:06:09.210
can hear it or maybe the tape.,00:06:09.210,00:06:11.700
Can you say yes or no?,00:06:11.700,00:06:14.650
"Do I have a subspace if I put
-- if I take all the vectors",00:06:14.650,00:06:20.770
"on the plane plus all -- and all
the ones on the line and just",00:06:20.770,00:06:25.660
"join them together -- but I'm
not taking this guy that's --",00:06:25.660,00:06:30.520
"actually, I'm not
taking most of them,",00:06:30.520,00:06:32.240
"because most vectors are not
on the line or the plane,",00:06:32.240,00:06:35.680
they're off somewhere else.,00:06:35.680,00:06:37.590
Do I have a subspace?,00:06:37.590,00:06:39.970
STUDENTS: No.,00:06:39.970,00:06:40.697
STRANG: Right.,00:06:40.697,00:06:41.280
Thank you.,00:06:41.280,00:06:41.790
No.,00:06:41.790,00:06:42.510
Because -- why not?,00:06:42.510,00:06:44.980
Because I can't add.,00:06:44.980,00:06:47.130
"Because if I that
requirement isn't satisfied.",00:06:47.130,00:06:52.090
"If I take one vector like
this guy and another vector",00:06:52.090,00:06:56.050
"that happens to come from L and
add, I'm off somewhere else.",00:06:56.050,00:07:00.100
"You see that I've gone outside
the union if I just add",00:07:00.100,00:07:06.870
"something from P and
something from L,",00:07:06.870,00:07:09.070
"then normally what'll happen
is I'm outside the union --",00:07:09.070,00:07:15.550
and I don't have a subspace.,00:07:15.550,00:07:16.770
So the correct answer is --,00:07:16.770,00:07:19.120
is not.,00:07:19.120,00:07:21.270
Okay.,00:07:21.270,00:07:21.850
"Now let me ask you about --
the other thing we do is take",00:07:21.850,00:07:25.630
the intersection.,00:07:25.630,00:07:28.240
So what does intersection mean?,00:07:28.240,00:07:30.410
"Intersection means all vectors
that are in both P and L.",00:07:30.410,00:07:43.830
Is this a subspace.,00:07:43.830,00:07:45.970
"Yeah, so I guess I want to go
back up to the same question.",00:07:45.970,00:07:49.730
This is or is not a subspace?,00:07:49.730,00:07:52.360
"And you can answer me -- answer
the question first for this",00:07:52.360,00:07:56.910
"particular example,
this picture I drew.",00:07:56.910,00:08:00.640
"What is P intersect
L for this case?",00:08:00.640,00:08:03.780
STUDENT: It's only zero.,00:08:03.780,00:08:05.280
STRANG: It's only zero.,00:08:05.280,00:08:07.810
"At least, sort of this was the
artist's idea as he drew it",00:08:07.810,00:08:11.240
"that, that that line L was
not in the plane and, went off",00:08:11.240,00:08:17.250
"somewhere else -- and then the
only point that was in common",00:08:17.250,00:08:21.120
was the zero vector.,00:08:21.120,00:08:22.770
"Is the zero vector
by itself a subspace?",00:08:22.770,00:08:25.430
STUDENT: Yes.,00:08:25.430,00:08:26.000
"STRANG: Yes, absolutely.",00:08:26.000,00:08:27.740
"And what about, if I don't
have this plane and this line",00:08:27.740,00:08:34.049
"but any subspace and
any other subspace?",00:08:34.049,00:08:38.789
"So now -- can I ask that
question for any two subspaces?",00:08:38.789,00:08:43.740
So maybe I'll write it up here.,00:08:43.740,00:08:46.800
If I'm strong enough.,00:08:46.800,00:08:50.240
Okay.,00:08:50.240,00:08:51.000
So this is the general question.,00:08:51.000,00:08:52.510
"I have subspaces, say S and T.",00:08:52.510,00:09:00.350
"And I want to ask you about
their intersection S intersect",00:09:00.350,00:09:08.640
T and I want --,00:09:08.640,00:09:11.300
it is a subspace.,00:09:11.300,00:09:13.220
Do you see why?,00:09:17.700,00:09:19.430
"Do you see why if I take the
vectors that are in both one-",00:09:19.430,00:09:24.610
"th- that are in both
of the subspaces --",00:09:24.610,00:09:27.930
"so that's like a smaller
set of vectors, probably,",00:09:27.930,00:09:30.490
"because it's -- we've
added requirements.",00:09:30.490,00:09:32.540
It has to be in S and in T.,00:09:32.540,00:09:36.370
How do I know that's a subspace?,00:09:36.370,00:09:38.100
"Can we just think through
that abstract stuff",00:09:38.100,00:09:40.560
and then I get to the examples.,00:09:40.560,00:09:43.640
Okay.,00:09:43.640,00:09:44.870
So why?,00:09:44.870,00:09:45.940
"Suppose I take a
couple of vectors",00:09:45.940,00:09:49.490
that are in the intersection.,00:09:49.490,00:09:51.040
"Why is the sum also
in the intersection?",00:09:51.040,00:09:56.500
"Okay, so let me give a name
to these vectors, say V and W.",00:09:56.500,00:10:00.900
They're in the intersection.,00:10:00.900,00:10:02.280
So that means they're both in S.,00:10:02.280,00:10:05.310
Also means they're both in T.,00:10:05.310,00:10:08.370
"So what can I say
about V plus W?",00:10:08.370,00:10:11.960
Is it in S?,00:10:11.960,00:10:14.350
Yes.,00:10:14.350,00:10:15.040
Right?,00:10:15.040,00:10:16.480
"If I take two vectors, V
and W that are both in S,",00:10:16.480,00:10:21.300
"then the sum is in S,
because S was a subspace.",00:10:21.300,00:10:24.900
"And if they're both
in T and I add them,",00:10:24.900,00:10:27.830
"then the result is also in
T, because T was a subspace.",00:10:27.830,00:10:31.990
"So the result V plus W
is in the intersection.",00:10:31.990,00:10:37.100
"It's in both and requirement
one is satisfied.",00:10:37.100,00:10:42.690
Requirement two's the same.,00:10:42.690,00:10:44.480
"If I take a vector that's in
both, I multiply by seven.",00:10:44.480,00:10:49.080
"Seven times that vector is in
S, because the vector was in S.",00:10:49.080,00:10:53.470
"Seven times that vector's in T
because the original one was in",00:10:53.470,00:10:57.290
"T. So seven times that vector
is in the intersection.",00:10:57.290,00:11:01.080
"In other words, when you
take the intersection of two",00:11:01.080,00:11:05.740
"subspaces, you get probably
a smaller subspace,",00:11:05.740,00:11:08.830
but it is a subspace.,00:11:08.830,00:11:10.440
Okay.,00:11:10.440,00:11:11.780
"So that's like sort of
just emphasizing what",00:11:11.780,00:11:17.270
these two requirements mean.,00:11:17.270,00:11:20.080
"Again -- Let me circle those,
because those are so important.",00:11:20.080,00:11:24.700
"The sum and the scale of
multiplication which combines",00:11:24.700,00:11:30.490
into linear combinations.,00:11:30.490,00:11:33.850
"That's what you have to
do inside the subspace.",00:11:33.850,00:11:37.130
Okay.,00:11:37.130,00:11:37.980
On to the column space.,00:11:37.980,00:11:41.530
Okay.,00:11:41.530,00:11:42.030
"So my lecture last time started
that and I want to continue it.",00:11:42.030,00:11:46.690
Okay.,00:11:46.690,00:11:47.190
Column space of a matrix.,00:11:47.190,00:11:48.680
Of A.,00:11:53.690,00:11:54.190
Okay.,00:11:54.190,00:11:56.060
Can I take an example?,00:11:56.060,00:11:59.240
Say one two three four.,00:11:59.240,00:12:03.030
One one one one.,00:12:03.030,00:12:06.410
Two three four five.,00:12:06.410,00:12:07.570
Okay.,00:12:11.760,00:12:14.370
That's my matrix A.,00:12:14.370,00:12:19.610
"So, it's got columns,
three columns.",00:12:19.610,00:12:25.900
"Those columns are vectors, so
the column space of this A,",00:12:25.900,00:12:29.700
of this A --,00:12:29.700,00:12:31.700
"let's stay with this
example for a while.",00:12:31.700,00:12:33.970
"The column space of this
matrix is a subspace of R --",00:12:33.970,00:12:40.520
R what?,00:12:40.520,00:12:41.600
"So what space are
we in if I'm looking",00:12:41.600,00:12:43.990
at the columns of this matrix?,00:12:43.990,00:12:46.730
"R^4 , right?",00:12:46.730,00:12:48.770
"These are vectors in R^4,
they're four dimensional",00:12:48.770,00:12:52.680
vectors.,00:12:52.680,00:12:53.800
"So it's this column space of
A is a subspace of R^4 here,",00:12:53.800,00:13:04.010
because A was four by --,00:13:04.010,00:13:07.030
A is a four by three matrix.,00:13:07.030,00:13:09.190
"This tells me how
many rows there are,",00:13:09.190,00:13:12.080
"how many components in a
column, and so we're in R^4.",00:13:12.080,00:13:16.020
"Okay, now what's
in that subspace?",00:13:16.020,00:13:20.030
"So the column space of A,
it's a subspace of R^4.",00:13:20.030,00:13:24.300
"I call it the column
space of A, like that.",00:13:24.300,00:13:28.790
"So that's my little symbol
for some subspace of R^4.",00:13:28.790,00:13:34.670
What's in that subspace?,00:13:34.670,00:13:37.480
"Well, that column certainly is.",00:13:37.480,00:13:40.010
One two three four.,00:13:40.010,00:13:41.350
This column is in.,00:13:41.350,00:13:42.460
"This column is
in, and what else?",00:13:42.460,00:13:45.750
"So it's got the
columns of A in it,",00:13:45.750,00:13:48.480
"but that's not
enough, certainly.",00:13:48.480,00:13:51.671
Right?,00:13:51.671,00:13:52.170
"I don't have a subspace if
I just put in three vectors.",00:13:52.170,00:13:55.700
"So how do I fill that
out to be a subspace?",00:13:55.700,00:13:59.210
"I take their linear
combinations.",00:13:59.210,00:14:06.000
"So the column space of A is
all linear combinations --",00:14:06.000,00:14:15.110
combinations of the columns.,00:14:15.110,00:14:16.710
"And that does give
me a subspace.",00:14:19.480,00:14:22.890
"It does give me a vector
space, because if I",00:14:22.890,00:14:24.890
"have one linear combination
and I multiply by eleven,",00:14:24.890,00:14:28.040
"I've got another
linear combination.",00:14:28.040,00:14:30.680
"If I have a linear
combination, I",00:14:30.680,00:14:32.190
"add to another
linear combination",00:14:32.190,00:14:33.730
I get a third combination.,00:14:33.730,00:14:35.970
"So that -- this is like
the smallest space --",00:14:35.970,00:14:40.260
"like, it's got to have
those three columns in it,",00:14:40.260,00:14:43.040
"and it has to have
their combinations",00:14:43.040,00:14:45.270
and that's where we stop.,00:14:45.270,00:14:47.110
Okay.,00:14:47.110,00:14:47.680
"Now I'm going to be
interested in that space.",00:14:47.680,00:14:54.120
"So I, like -- get some idea
of what's in that space.",00:14:54.120,00:14:56.930
How big is that space?,00:14:56.930,00:14:58.450
"Is that space the whole
four dimensional space?",00:14:58.450,00:15:02.880
Or is it a subspace inside?,00:15:02.880,00:15:05.290
"Can you -- let me just see if
we can get a yes or no answer",00:15:05.290,00:15:13.870
"sometimes without being
ready for the complete proof.",00:15:13.870,00:15:19.930
What do you think?,00:15:22.660,00:15:23.540
"Is the subspace that
I'm talking about here,",00:15:23.540,00:15:26.590
"the combinations of
those three guys,",00:15:26.590,00:15:28.700
"does that fill the full
four dimensional space?",00:15:28.700,00:15:32.250
Maybe yes or no on that one.,00:15:32.250,00:15:34.900
No.,00:15:34.900,00:15:35.560
No.,00:15:35.560,00:15:36.060
"Somehow our feeling
is, and it happens",00:15:36.060,00:15:39.640
"to be right, that if we
start with three vectors",00:15:39.640,00:15:42.730
"and take their combinations,
we can't get the whole four",00:15:42.730,00:15:45.660
dimensional space.,00:15:45.660,00:15:48.680
"Now -- so somehow we
get a smaller space.",00:15:48.680,00:15:52.590
But how much smaller?,00:15:52.590,00:15:55.010
That's going to come up here.,00:15:55.010,00:15:57.280
That's not so immediate.,00:15:57.280,00:16:00.970
"Let me first make this
critical connection with --",00:16:00.970,00:16:07.950
"with, linear equations, because
behind our abstract definition,",00:16:07.950,00:16:15.980
we have a purpose.,00:16:15.980,00:16:17.360
And that is to understand Ax=b.,00:16:17.360,00:16:19.750
"So suppose I make
the connection --",00:16:19.750,00:16:22.950
"w- w- does A x=b always
have a solution for every b?",00:16:22.950,00:16:33.330
"Have a solution for
every right-hand side?",00:16:33.330,00:16:47.850
"I guess that's going to
be a yes or no question.",00:16:47.850,00:16:49.880
"And then I'm going to ask which
right-hand sides are okay?",00:16:53.220,00:16:59.580
"That's really the
question I'm after,",00:16:59.580,00:17:02.050
"is which right-hand
sides (b) do make up --",00:17:02.050,00:17:08.900
"you can see from the way I'm
speaking what the question --",00:17:08.900,00:17:12.210
As it is.,00:17:12.210,00:17:13.839
The answer is no.,00:17:13.839,00:17:16.020
"A x=b does not have a
solution for every b.",00:17:16.020,00:17:21.710
Why do I say no?,00:17:21.710,00:17:26.069
"Because A x=b is -- like,
this is four equations,",00:17:26.069,00:17:34.660
and only three unknowns.,00:17:34.660,00:17:35.940
Right?,00:17:39.590,00:17:40.860
"X is -- let me right
out that whole --",00:17:40.860,00:17:46.057
what the whole thing looks like.,00:17:46.057,00:17:47.390
Yeah.,00:17:49.940,00:17:50.600
Let me write out A x=b.,00:17:50.600,00:17:54.680
A x is --,00:17:54.680,00:17:59.310
"these columns are
one two three four.",00:17:59.310,00:18:02.260
"One one one one and
two three four five.",00:18:02.260,00:18:07.050
"Then x, of course, has three
components, x1, x2, x3.",00:18:07.050,00:18:12.410
And I'm trying to get the --,00:18:12.410,00:18:15.610
"hit the right-hand
side, b1,b2,b3 and b4.",00:18:15.610,00:18:19.257
"So my first point is,
I can't always do it.",00:18:25.430,00:18:27.850
"In a way, that just says again
what you told me five minutes",00:18:30.560,00:18:34.140
ago --,00:18:34.140,00:18:36.220
"that the combinations
of these columns",00:18:36.220,00:18:39.540
"don't fill the whole
four dimensional space.",00:18:39.540,00:18:42.630
"There's going to be some
vectors b, a lot of vectors b,",00:18:42.630,00:18:46.190
"that are not combinations
of these three columns,",00:18:46.190,00:18:50.530
"because the combinations
of those columns are, like,",00:18:50.530,00:18:53.200
"going to be just a little
plane or something inside --",00:18:53.200,00:18:56.130
inside R^4.,00:18:56.130,00:18:58.050
"Now, so and you see that I do
have four equations and only",00:18:58.050,00:19:03.990
three unknowns.,00:19:03.990,00:19:05.210
"So, like anybody is going
to say, no you dope,",00:19:05.210,00:19:09.110
"you can't usually
solve four equations",00:19:09.110,00:19:11.650
with only three unknowns.,00:19:11.650,00:19:13.330
"But now I want to say
sometimes you can.",00:19:13.330,00:19:17.710
"For some right-hand
sides, I can solve this.",00:19:17.710,00:19:22.330
"So that's the bunch
of right-hand sides",00:19:22.330,00:19:25.900
"that I'm interested
in right now.",00:19:25.900,00:19:28.710
"Which right-hand sides
allow me to solve this?",00:19:28.710,00:19:34.860
This is the question for today.,00:19:34.860,00:19:36.740
"It's going to have, like,
a nice clear answer.",00:19:36.740,00:19:40.240
"So my question is -- is
which bs, which vectors b,",00:19:40.240,00:19:50.800
allow this system to be solved?,00:19:50.800,00:19:55.200
And I want to ask you --,00:19:59.640,00:20:03.150
"so that's, like, gets two
question marks to indicate",00:20:03.150,00:20:08.090
"that's -- this is the
important question.",00:20:08.090,00:20:10.350
"Okay, first, before we
give a total answer,",00:20:10.350,00:20:15.030
give me just a partial answer.,00:20:15.030,00:20:18.000
"Tell me one right-hand
side that I know",00:20:18.000,00:20:20.910
I can solve this thing for.,00:20:20.910,00:20:23.160
So -- all zeroes.,00:20:23.160,00:20:24.910
Okay.,00:20:24.910,00:20:25.410
"That's the, like, guaranteed.",00:20:25.410,00:20:28.000
"If these were all zero,
then I know I can solve it,",00:20:28.000,00:20:31.990
"let the x-s all be
zero, no problem.",00:20:31.990,00:20:35.550
So that's always a -- okay.,00:20:35.550,00:20:38.890
Okay.,00:20:38.890,00:20:39.660
A x=0 I can always solve.,00:20:39.660,00:20:42.460
"Now tell me another
right-hand side,",00:20:42.460,00:20:45.040
"just a specific set of numbers
for which I can solve these",00:20:45.040,00:20:52.740
"three -- these four equations
with only three unknowns,",00:20:52.740,00:20:55.700
"but if you give me a good
right-hand side, I can do it.",00:20:55.700,00:21:00.130
So tell me one?,00:21:00.130,00:21:00.842
STUDENT: 1 2 3 4.,00:21:00.842,00:21:01.550
STRANG: 1 2 3 4?,00:21:01.550,00:21:04.740
"If I -- can I solve -- is
that a good right-hand side?",00:21:04.740,00:21:09.575
"Can you solve -- can you
find a solution that --",00:21:12.340,00:21:15.340
"X one plus X two plus
two X three is one,",00:21:15.340,00:21:18.630
"two X one plus X two plus three
X three is two and two more",00:21:18.630,00:21:22.630
equations --,00:21:22.630,00:21:23.858
"so I'm asking you to
solve in your head in --",00:21:27.210,00:21:30.220
"within five seconds, four
equations and three unknowns,",00:21:30.220,00:21:35.750
"but you can do it, because
the right-hand side is, like,",00:21:35.750,00:21:41.310
"showing up here is --
it's one of the columns.",00:21:41.310,00:21:44.610
"So tell me what's the
X that does solve it?",00:21:44.610,00:21:48.330
One zero zero.,00:21:48.330,00:21:50.140
"One zero zero solves
it, because --",00:21:50.140,00:21:55.960
"well, so you can multiply
this out by rows, but oh God,",00:21:55.960,00:22:01.450
"it's much nicer to say -- okay,
this is one of this column,",00:22:01.450,00:22:06.360
"zero of this, zero of this,
so it's one of that column,",00:22:06.360,00:22:09.190
which is exactly what we wanted.,00:22:09.190,00:22:11.730
Okay.,00:22:11.730,00:22:13.290
So there is a b that's okay.,00:22:13.290,00:22:17.280
"Now tell me another
B that's okay,",00:22:17.280,00:22:19.250
"another right-hand side
that would be all right?",00:22:19.250,00:22:23.030
Well -- all ones?,00:22:23.030,00:22:25.055
"Actually -- and then what's
the solution in that case?",00:22:29.480,00:22:33.450
"0 1 0, thanks.",00:22:33.450,00:22:36.080
"And, in fact, it's
much e- like, one way",00:22:36.080,00:22:40.190
"to do it is think of a
solution first, right,",00:22:40.190,00:22:44.230
"and then just see what
b turns out to be.",00:22:44.230,00:22:50.380
"What b turns out to be, right.",00:22:50.380,00:22:53.030
Okay.,00:22:53.030,00:22:54.790
"So I think of a solution
-- so I think of an x,",00:22:54.790,00:22:58.220
I think of any --,00:22:58.220,00:23:00.380
"x1, x2, x3, I do
this multiplication",00:23:00.380,00:23:03.810
and what have I got?,00:23:03.810,00:23:04.980
"Now I'm ready to answer
the big question.",00:23:09.640,00:23:13.920
"I can solve A x=b exactly
when the right-hand side B is",00:23:13.920,00:23:20.830
a vector in the column space.,00:23:20.830,00:23:24.920
Good.,00:23:24.920,00:23:25.900
"I can solve A x=b when b is
a combination of the columns,",00:23:25.900,00:23:33.140
when it's in the column space --,00:23:33.140,00:23:36.130
"so let me write
that answer down.",00:23:36.130,00:23:39.730
"I can solve Ax=b exactly when
B is in the column space.",00:23:39.730,00:23:57.910
"Let me just say
again why that is.",00:23:57.910,00:24:02.210
"Because it -- the column space
by its definition contains all",00:24:02.210,00:24:07.030
the combinations.,00:24:07.030,00:24:07.870
It contains all the Ax-s.,00:24:07.870,00:24:10.710
"The column space really consists
of all vectors A times any X.",00:24:10.710,00:24:17.360
"So those are the bs
that I can deal with.",00:24:17.360,00:24:22.900
"If b is a combination
of the columns,",00:24:22.900,00:24:26.130
"then that combination
tells me what X should be.",00:24:26.130,00:24:32.080
"If b is not a combination of
the columns, then there is no x.",00:24:32.080,00:24:35.630
"There's no way to
solve A x equal b.",00:24:35.630,00:24:38.650
Okay.,00:24:38.650,00:24:40.420
So the column space --,00:24:40.420,00:24:42.700
"that's really why we're
interested in this column",00:24:42.700,00:24:45.510
"space, because it's
the central guy.",00:24:45.510,00:24:48.170
"It says when we can
solve, and that --",00:24:48.170,00:24:56.390
"we got to understand
this column space better.",00:24:56.390,00:24:58.880
Let's see.,00:25:02.420,00:25:03.000
Do I want to think --,00:25:03.000,00:25:07.260
"yeah, somehow -- oh,
well, let's just --",00:25:07.260,00:25:10.600
"as long as we've got it
here, what do I get for this",00:25:10.600,00:25:13.360
particular example?,00:25:13.360,00:25:14.550
"If I take combinations of
this and this and this,",00:25:14.550,00:25:24.670
"I'll tell you the question
that's in my mind.",00:25:24.670,00:25:28.230
"It's not even proper
to use this word yet,",00:25:28.230,00:25:30.930
but you'll know what it means.,00:25:30.930,00:25:33.280
"Are those three
columns independent?",00:25:33.280,00:25:38.060
"If I take the combinations
of the three columns --",00:25:38.060,00:25:44.370
"does each column contribute
something new or now?",00:25:44.370,00:25:50.550
"So that if I take the
combinations of those three",00:25:50.550,00:25:53.360
"columns, do I, like, get some
three dimensional subspace --",00:25:53.360,00:25:57.160
"do I have three vectors
that are, like, you know,",00:25:57.160,00:26:00.630
"independent,
whatever that means?",00:26:00.630,00:26:07.440
"Or do I -- is one of
those columns, like,",00:26:07.440,00:26:10.080
contributing nothing new --,00:26:10.080,00:26:12.370
"So that actually only
two of the columns",00:26:12.370,00:26:15.630
"would have given the
same column space?",00:26:15.630,00:26:19.040
"Yeah -- that's a good
way to ask the question.",00:26:19.040,00:26:21.080
Finally I think of it.,00:26:21.080,00:26:22.550
Can I throw away any columns --,00:26:22.550,00:26:25.340
and have the same column space?,00:26:25.340,00:26:27.339
STUDENT: Yes.,00:26:27.339,00:26:27.880
STRANG: Yes.,00:26:27.880,00:26:29.100
"And which one do you
suggest I throw away?",00:26:29.100,00:26:31.290
STUDENT: Column three -- three.,00:26:31.290,00:26:32.670
"STRANG: Well, three is the
natural, like, guy to target.",00:26:32.670,00:26:37.350
So if I -- and why?,00:26:37.350,00:26:39.490
"Because -- what's so
bad about three here?",00:26:39.490,00:26:44.750
Column three?,00:26:44.750,00:26:46.240
"It's the sum of these, right?",00:26:46.240,00:26:48.310
"So it's not -- if I'm taking --
if I have combinations of these",00:26:48.310,00:26:52.370
"two and I put in
this one, actually,",00:26:52.370,00:26:54.510
I don't get anything more.,00:26:54.510,00:26:56.780
"So later on I will call
these pivot columns.",00:26:56.780,00:27:02.460
"And the third guy will not
be a pivot column in this --",00:27:02.460,00:27:06.780
with those numbers.,00:27:06.780,00:27:08.760
"Now actually -- honesty makes
me ask you this question.",00:27:08.760,00:27:12.940
"Could I have thrown
away column one?",00:27:12.940,00:27:16.350
"Yes, I could.",00:27:16.350,00:27:17.940
I could.,00:27:17.940,00:27:19.920
"So when I say pivot
columns, my convention",00:27:19.920,00:27:22.910
"is, okay, I'll keep the first
ones as long as they're not",00:27:22.910,00:27:26.710
dependent.,00:27:26.710,00:27:27.590
"So I keep this guy,
he's fine, he's a line.",00:27:27.590,00:27:30.930
I keep the second guy.,00:27:30.930,00:27:32.100
It's in a second direction.,00:27:32.100,00:27:33.810
"But the third one, which is in
the same plane as the first two",00:27:33.810,00:27:39.220
gives me nothing new.,00:27:39.220,00:27:40.790
"It's dependent in the
language that we will use",00:27:40.790,00:27:44.560
and I don't need it.,00:27:44.560,00:27:46.990
Okay.,00:27:46.990,00:27:48.160
"So I would describe the column
space of this matrix as a two",00:27:48.160,00:27:53.570
dimensional subspace of R^4.,00:27:53.570,00:27:56.040
"A two dimensional
subspace of R^4.",00:27:58.680,00:28:01.070
Okay.,00:28:01.070,00:28:01.990
"So you're seeing how these
vector spaces work and you --",00:28:01.990,00:28:05.430
"you're seeing that we --
some idea of dependence",00:28:05.430,00:28:08.760
"or independence
is in our future.",00:28:08.760,00:28:11.780
Okay.,00:28:11.780,00:28:12.400
"Now I want to speak
about another vector",00:28:12.400,00:28:16.590
"space, the null space.",00:28:16.590,00:28:20.460
"So again I'm getting
a little ahead",00:28:20.460,00:28:23.890
"because it's in section three
point two, but that's okay.",00:28:23.890,00:28:28.191
All right.,00:28:28.191,00:28:28.690
"Now I'm ready for
the null space.",00:28:28.690,00:28:31.870
Let me keep the same matrix.,00:28:31.870,00:28:33.340
"And this is going
to be a different --",00:28:36.830,00:28:39.370
totally different subspace.,00:28:39.370,00:28:41.500
Totally different.,00:28:41.500,00:28:43.270
Okay.,00:28:43.270,00:28:44.930
"Now -- so let me
make space for it.",00:28:44.930,00:28:47.370
"Now -- here comes a
completely different subspace,",00:28:47.370,00:28:50.190
the null space of A.,00:28:50.190,00:29:00.120
What's in it?,00:29:00.120,00:29:00.935
"It contains not
right-hand sides b.",00:29:04.240,00:29:10.070
It contains x-s.,00:29:10.070,00:29:12.750
"It contains all
x-s that solve --",00:29:12.750,00:29:16.570
this word null is going to --,00:29:16.570,00:29:18.040
"I mean, that's the key
word here, meaning zero.",00:29:18.040,00:29:22.580
"So this contains --
this is all solutions x,",00:29:22.580,00:29:30.670
"and of course x is our
vectors, x1, x2 and x3,",00:29:30.670,00:29:36.450
to the equation A x=0.,00:29:36.450,00:29:41.220
"Well, four equations,
because we've got --",00:29:43.800,00:29:47.800
"so, do you see what I'm doing?",00:29:47.800,00:29:50.230
"I'm now saying, okay,
columns were great,",00:29:50.230,00:29:53.890
the column space we understood.,00:29:53.890,00:29:56.010
Now I'm interested in x-s.,00:29:56.010,00:29:59.260
"I'm not -- the only b I'm
interested in now is the b",00:29:59.260,00:30:02.860
of all zeroes.,00:30:02.860,00:30:03.670
"The right-hand
side is now zeroes.",00:30:03.670,00:30:06.300
And I'm interested in solutions.,00:30:06.300,00:30:08.550
x-s.,00:30:12.140,00:30:12.810
"So t- where is this null
space for this example?",00:30:12.810,00:30:18.740
"These x-s are -- have
three components.",00:30:18.740,00:30:23.600
"So the null space
is a subspace --",00:30:23.600,00:30:26.310
"we still have to show it
is a subspace -- of R^3.",00:30:26.310,00:30:31.390
"So this is -- and
we will show --",00:30:31.390,00:30:35.590
"these vectors x, this is in
R^3, where the column space was",00:30:35.590,00:30:46.220
in R^4 in our example.,00:30:46.220,00:30:50.910
"For an m by n matrix,
this is m and this is n,",00:30:50.910,00:30:58.340
"because the number
of columns, n,",00:30:58.340,00:31:00.570
"tells me how many
unknowns, how many x-s",00:31:00.570,00:31:03.000
"multiply those
columns, so it tells me",00:31:03.000,00:31:05.950
"the big space, in this
case R three that I'm in.",00:31:05.950,00:31:10.480
"Now tell me -- why don't we
figure out what the null space",00:31:10.480,00:31:14.300
"is for this example,
just by looking at it.",00:31:14.300,00:31:20.310
"I mean, that's the
beauty of small examples,",00:31:20.310,00:31:24.740
"that my official way to find
null spaces and column spaces",00:31:24.740,00:31:30.500
"and get all the facts
straight would be elimination,",00:31:30.500,00:31:36.200
and we'll do that.,00:31:36.200,00:31:37.340
"But with a small example,
we can see that --",00:31:37.340,00:31:40.120
"see what's going on without
going through the mechanics",00:31:40.120,00:31:43.150
of elimination.,00:31:43.150,00:31:43.950
So this null space --,00:31:43.950,00:31:48.670
"so I'm talking about --
again, the null space,",00:31:48.670,00:31:51.540
"and let me copy
again the matrix.",00:31:51.540,00:31:53.520
"One two three four, one one one
one and two three four five.",00:31:56.530,00:32:04.190
What's in the null space?,00:32:04.190,00:32:05.330
"So I'm taking A times x,
so let me right it again,",00:32:05.330,00:32:11.410
"and I want you to solve
those four equations.",00:32:11.410,00:32:16.015
"In fact, I want you
to find all solutions",00:32:19.500,00:32:21.490
to those four equations.,00:32:21.490,00:32:24.350
"Well, actually, just
first of all find one.",00:32:24.350,00:32:26.870
"Why should I ask
you for all of them?",00:32:26.870,00:32:28.420
"Tell me one -- well, tell
me one solution that y-",00:32:28.420,00:32:31.020
"you don't even have to look at
the matrix to know one solution",00:32:31.020,00:32:35.660
to this set of equations.,00:32:35.660,00:32:38.030
It is zero vector.,00:32:38.030,00:32:41.430
"Whatever that matrix is, its
null space contains zero --",00:32:41.430,00:32:46.810
"because A times the zero vector
sure gives the zero right-hand",00:32:46.810,00:32:51.020
side.,00:32:51.020,00:32:51.660
"So the null space
certainly contains zero.",00:32:51.660,00:32:55.700
"A- so it's got a chance
to be a vector space now,",00:32:55.700,00:32:58.220
and it will turn out it is.,00:32:58.220,00:33:00.200
Okay.,00:33:00.200,00:33:00.880
Tell me another solution.,00:33:00.880,00:33:04.180
"So this particular null space --
and of course I'm going to call",00:33:04.180,00:33:07.800
it N(A) for null space --,00:33:07.800,00:33:11.110
"this contains-- well we've
already located the zero",00:33:11.110,00:33:17.160
"vector, and now you're going
to tell me another vector",00:33:17.160,00:33:20.970
"that's in the null space,
another solution, another x,",00:33:20.970,00:33:24.550
another --,00:33:24.550,00:33:26.340
"you see what I'm
asking you for is",00:33:26.340,00:33:28.140
a combination of those columns.,00:33:28.140,00:33:29.950
"That's what I'm always looking
at combinations of columns,",00:33:29.950,00:33:33.150
"but now I'm looking at the
weights, the coefficients",00:33:33.150,00:33:40.800
in the combination.,00:33:40.800,00:33:41.710
"So tell me a good set of
numbers to put in there.",00:33:41.710,00:33:46.620
One one -- STUDENTS: Minus one.,00:33:46.620,00:33:50.420
STRANG: One one minus one.,00:33:50.420,00:33:51.530
Thanks.,00:33:51.530,00:33:53.340
One one minus one.,00:33:53.340,00:33:55.280
"So there's a vector
that's in it.",00:33:55.280,00:33:56.730
Okay.,00:33:59.260,00:34:00.250
"But have I got a
subspace at this point?",00:34:00.250,00:34:02.600
"Certainly not, right?",00:34:02.600,00:34:04.690
"I've got just a
couple of vectors.",00:34:04.690,00:34:06.850
No way they make a subspace.,00:34:06.850,00:34:08.860
"Tell me -- actually, why don't
I jump the whole way now?",00:34:08.860,00:34:12.940
"Tell me -- well, tell
me one more solution,",00:34:12.940,00:34:16.840
one more X that would work.,00:34:16.840,00:34:19.460
Student: 2 2 -2.,00:34:19.460,00:34:21.199
STRANG: 2 2 -2?,00:34:21.199,00:34:22.520
"Oh, well, tell me all of them,
that would have been easier.",00:34:22.520,00:34:27.750
"Tell me the whole lot, now.",00:34:27.750,00:34:30.370
"What is the null
space for this matrix?",00:34:30.370,00:34:34.389
"It's all vectors of the
form -- what could this be?",00:34:34.389,00:34:38.670
"It could be one one minus one,
it could be it could be any",00:34:38.670,00:34:44.900
"number C, any number -- the
same number again and --",00:34:44.900,00:34:50.880
STUDENTS: Minus.,00:34:50.880,00:34:52.010
STRANG: Minus C.,00:34:52.010,00:34:53.420
In other words --,00:34:53.420,00:34:55.010
"actually, any
multiple of this guy.",00:34:55.010,00:34:59.910
"Oh, that's the
perfect description,",00:34:59.910,00:35:02.270
"because now the zero vector's
automatically included",00:35:02.270,00:35:08.050
because C could be zero.,00:35:08.050,00:35:10.040
"The vector I had is included,
because C could be one.",00:35:10.040,00:35:12.810
But now any vector.,00:35:12.810,00:35:14.750
And that's actually it.,00:35:14.750,00:35:16.860
And do I have a subspace?,00:35:20.830,00:35:24.450
And what does it look like?,00:35:24.450,00:35:26.060
"It's in -- how would you
describe this, the null space,",00:35:26.060,00:35:30.620
"this -- all these vectors of
this form C C minus C, like,",00:35:30.620,00:35:35.810
seven seven minus seven.,00:35:35.810,00:35:38.730
"Minus eleven minus
eleven plus eleven.",00:35:38.730,00:35:41.080
What have I got here?,00:35:41.080,00:35:43.810
"If -- describe that whole
null space of -- what --",00:35:43.810,00:35:46.120
"if I drew it, what do I draw?",00:35:46.120,00:35:50.550
"A line, right?",00:35:50.550,00:35:51.840
The null space is a line.,00:35:51.840,00:35:53.350
"It's the line through -- in R^3
and the vector one one negative",00:35:53.350,00:36:02.724
"one maybe goes down here, I
don't know where it goes, say,",00:36:02.724,00:36:05.140
down here.,00:36:05.140,00:36:06.530
"There's the vector one one
negative one that you gave me.",00:36:06.530,00:36:12.660
"And where is the
vector C C negative C?",00:36:12.660,00:36:15.610
It's on this line.,00:36:15.610,00:36:17.050
"Of course, there's zero
zero zero that we had.",00:36:17.050,00:36:19.800
"And what we've got is that whole
-- oops -- that whole line,",00:36:19.800,00:36:23.720
"going both ways,
through the origin.",00:36:23.720,00:36:28.640
The null space is a line in R^3.,00:36:28.640,00:36:31.030
Okay.,00:36:35.970,00:36:37.930
"For that example, we could
find all the combinations",00:36:37.930,00:36:43.040
"of the columns that
gave zero at sight.",00:36:43.040,00:36:46.590
"Now, can I just
take one more time,",00:36:46.590,00:36:51.600
"to go back to the definition
of subspace, vector space,",00:36:51.600,00:36:57.860
and ask you --,00:36:57.860,00:37:01.060
"how do I know that the null
space is a vector space?",00:37:01.060,00:37:05.400
"How I entitled to
use this word space?",00:37:05.400,00:37:08.610
"I'll never use that word space
without meaning that the two",00:37:08.610,00:37:13.070
requirements are satisfied.,00:37:13.070,00:37:15.800
Can we just check that they are?,00:37:15.800,00:37:18.250
So I'm going to check that --,00:37:18.250,00:37:20.810
can I just continue here?,00:37:20.810,00:37:22.660
"Check that -- that the
solutions to A x=0 always give",00:37:22.660,00:37:39.240
a subspace.,00:37:39.240,00:37:42.740
"And, of course, the key
word is that= ""Space.""",00:37:42.740,00:37:47.700
So what do I have to check?,00:37:47.700,00:37:49.840
"I have to show that if I
have one solution, call it x,",00:37:53.410,00:37:57.340
"and another
solution, call it x*,",00:37:57.340,00:38:01.240
"that their sum is also
a solution, right?",00:38:01.240,00:38:05.970
That's a requirement.,00:38:05.970,00:38:07.290
"To use that word
space, I have to say --",00:38:07.290,00:38:10.010
"I have to convince myself that
if A x is zero and also --",00:38:10.010,00:38:18.650
"and A x* is zero, or maybe I
should have said if A v is zero",00:38:18.650,00:38:25.140
"and A w is zero, then
what about v plus w?",00:38:25.140,00:38:30.130
"Shall I -- let me
use those letters.",00:38:30.130,00:38:32.630
"If A v is zero and A w is zero,
then what -- if that and that,",00:38:32.630,00:38:47.300
then what's my point here?,00:38:47.300,00:38:49.240
That A times (v+w) must be zero.,00:38:49.240,00:38:55.170
"That says that if v is in the
null space and w's in the null",00:38:55.170,00:38:59.590
"space, then their sum
v+w is in the null space.",00:38:59.590,00:39:03.680
"And of course, now that
I've written it down,",00:39:03.680,00:39:06.250
"it's totally absurd,
ridiculously simple --",00:39:06.250,00:39:11.460
"because matrix multiplication
allows me to separate that out",00:39:11.460,00:39:17.290
into A v plus A w.,00:39:17.290,00:39:19.460
I shouldn't say absurdly simple.,00:39:22.050,00:39:23.560
That was a dumb thing to say.,00:39:23.560,00:39:24.840
"Could -- we've used, here,
a basic law of matrix",00:39:24.840,00:39:28.960
multiplication.,00:39:28.960,00:39:30.580
"Actually, we've used it without
proving it, but that's okay.",00:39:30.580,00:39:34.070
"We only live so long,
we just skip that proof.",00:39:34.070,00:39:39.340
"I think it's called the
distributive law that I can",00:39:39.340,00:39:42.820
"split these -- split
this into two pieces.",00:39:42.820,00:39:45.770
"But now you see the point, that
A v is zero and A w is zero",00:39:45.770,00:39:52.150
"so I have zero plus
zero and I do get zero.",00:39:52.150,00:39:54.520
It checks.,00:39:54.520,00:39:56.430
"And, similarly, I have to
show that if A v is zero,",00:39:56.430,00:40:02.070
"then A times any multiple,
say 12v is also zero.",00:40:02.070,00:40:10.130
And how do I know that?,00:40:10.130,00:40:11.590
"Because I'm allowed to s-
bring that twelve outside.",00:40:11.590,00:40:14.900
"A number, a scaler can move
outside, so I have twelve A vs,",00:40:14.900,00:40:20.640
twelve zeroes --,00:40:20.640,00:40:21.740
I have zero.,00:40:21.740,00:40:23.960
Okay.,00:40:23.960,00:40:25.550
"Just to -- it's really
critical to understand the --",00:40:25.550,00:40:33.070
oh yeah.,00:40:33.070,00:40:34.390
"Here -- I was going to say,
understand what's the point",00:40:34.390,00:40:38.220
of a vector space?,00:40:38.220,00:40:39.470
"Let me make that point by
changing the right-hand side.",00:40:39.470,00:40:44.790
Oops.,00:40:44.790,00:40:45.920
Okay.,00:40:45.920,00:40:46.420
"Let me change the right-hand
side to one two three four.",00:40:46.420,00:40:49.740
"Oh, okay.",00:40:49.740,00:40:51.632
"Why don't we do all of linear
algebra in one lecture,",00:40:51.632,00:40:53.840
then we --,00:40:53.840,00:40:54.890
okay.,00:40:54.890,00:40:55.900
"I would like to know the
solutions to this equation.",00:40:55.900,00:41:00.500
For those four equations.,00:41:00.500,00:41:01.670
So I have four equations.,00:41:05.060,00:41:06.660
"I have only three
unknowns, so if I",00:41:06.660,00:41:09.039
"don't have a pretty
special right-hand side",00:41:09.039,00:41:10.830
"there won't be any
solution at all.",00:41:10.830,00:41:12.640
"But that is a very
special right-hand side.",00:41:12.640,00:41:16.070
"And we know that there is
a solution, one zero zero.",00:41:16.070,00:41:21.450
Were there any more solutions?,00:41:21.450,00:41:23.730
"And did they form
a vector space?",00:41:23.730,00:41:27.320
Okay.,00:41:27.320,00:41:28.600
"So I'm asking two
questions there.",00:41:28.600,00:41:31.550
"One is, do -- so my right-hand
side now is not zero anymore.",00:41:31.550,00:41:35.530
"I'm not looking
at the null space",00:41:35.530,00:41:37.100
because I changed from zeroes.,00:41:37.100,00:41:40.070
"So my first question is, do
the solutions, if there are any",00:41:40.070,00:41:45.930
"and there are, do
they form a subspace?",00:41:45.930,00:41:50.610
"Let's answer that
question first.",00:41:50.610,00:41:53.270
Yes or no.,00:41:53.270,00:41:54.210
"Do I get a subspace if I
look at the solutions to --",00:41:54.210,00:41:59.640
let me go back to x1 x2 x3.,00:41:59.640,00:42:03.300
"I'm looking at all the x-s, at
all those vectors in R^3 that",00:42:03.300,00:42:08.910
solve A x -b.,00:42:08.910,00:42:10.380
"The only thing I've changed
is b isn't zero anymore.",00:42:10.380,00:42:13.400
"Do the x-s, the solutions,
form a vector space?",00:42:17.360,00:42:21.045
"The solutions to this
do not form a subspace.",00:42:25.860,00:42:32.670
"The solutions don't, because --",00:42:32.670,00:42:36.150
how shall I see that?,00:42:36.150,00:42:38.460
"The zero vector is not a
solution, so I never even got",00:42:38.460,00:42:42.950
started.,00:42:42.950,00:42:43.700
"The zero vector doesn't
solve this system.",00:42:43.700,00:42:46.090
"I can't -- solutions
can't be a vector space.",00:42:46.090,00:42:51.940
Now what are they like?,00:42:51.940,00:42:55.480
"Well, we'll see this, but
let's do it for this example.",00:42:55.480,00:42:58.810
So one zero zero was a solution.,00:42:58.810,00:43:02.200
You saw that right away.,00:43:02.200,00:43:03.690
Are there any other solutions?,00:43:03.690,00:43:05.310
"Can you tell me
a second solution",00:43:05.310,00:43:08.730
to this system of equations?,00:43:08.730,00:43:10.430
STUDENTS: 0 -1 1 STRANG: 0 -1 1.,00:43:10.430,00:43:14.970
"Boy, that's -- 0 -1 1.",00:43:14.970,00:43:19.560
Yes.,00:43:19.560,00:43:20.680
"Because that says I take minus
this column plus this one",00:43:20.680,00:43:24.090
and sure enough.,00:43:24.090,00:43:24.790
That's right.,00:43:24.790,00:43:27.730
"So there are -- there's a
bunch of solutions here.",00:43:27.730,00:43:30.750
But they're not a subspace.,00:43:35.160,00:43:37.300
I'll tell you what it's like.,00:43:37.300,00:43:38.540
"It's like a plane that
doesn't go through the origin,",00:43:38.540,00:43:41.460
"or a line that doesn't
go through the origin.",00:43:41.460,00:43:43.930
"Maybe in this case
it's a line that",00:43:43.930,00:43:45.870
"doesn't go through
the origin, if I graft",00:43:45.870,00:43:47.870
the solutions to A x equal B.,00:43:47.870,00:43:50.570
"So you -- I think
you've got the idea.",00:43:50.570,00:43:53.550
"Subspaces have to go
through the origin.",00:43:53.550,00:43:56.780
"If I'm looking at x-s, then
they'd better solve Ax=0.",00:43:56.780,00:44:01.590
In a way I've got --,00:44:01.590,00:44:04.690
"my two subspaces that I --
talking about today are kind",00:44:04.690,00:44:10.800
"of the two ways I can tell
you what a -- about subspace.",00:44:10.800,00:44:17.340
"If I want to tell you
about the column space,",00:44:17.340,00:44:20.100
"I tell you a few columns and
I say take their combinations.",00:44:20.100,00:44:24.780
Like I build up this subspace.,00:44:24.780,00:44:27.330
"I put in a few vectors, their
combinations make a subspace.",00:44:27.330,00:44:31.440
"Now, when I went to -- let me
come back to the one that is",00:44:31.440,00:44:35.010
a subspace here.,00:44:35.010,00:44:36.180
"Here, when I talked
about the null space,",00:44:40.980,00:44:44.430
I didn't tell you what's in it.,00:44:44.430,00:44:46.960
"We had to figure
out what was in it.",00:44:46.960,00:44:49.350
"What I told you was the
equations that I'm --",00:44:49.350,00:44:53.290
that has to be satisfied.,00:44:53.290,00:44:55.180
You see those --,00:44:55.180,00:44:56.680
"like, those are the two
natural ways to tell you",00:44:56.680,00:44:59.890
what's in a subspace.,00:44:59.890,00:45:02.460
"I can either give you a few
vectors and say fill it out,",00:45:02.460,00:45:06.730
take combinations --,00:45:06.730,00:45:08.660
"or I can give you a system of
equations, the requirements",00:45:08.660,00:45:12.800
that the x-s have to satisfy.,00:45:12.800,00:45:17.390
"And both of those
ways produce subspaces",00:45:17.390,00:45:20.400
"and they're the important
ways to construct subspaces.",00:45:20.400,00:45:25.080
"Okay, so today's
lecture actually got,",00:45:25.080,00:45:29.730
"the essentials of
three point two,",00:45:29.730,00:45:33.260
the idea of the null space.,00:45:33.260,00:45:35.250
"Now we have to
tackle, Wednesday,",00:45:35.250,00:45:37.740
"the job of how do
we actually get hold",00:45:37.740,00:45:40.490
"of that subspace in an
example that's bigger",00:45:40.490,00:45:43.530
and we can't see it just by eye.,00:45:43.530,00:45:45.960
Okay.,00:45:45.960,00:45:48.770
See you Wednesday.,00:45:48.770,00:45:57.190
Thanks.,00:45:57.190,00:45:58.740
