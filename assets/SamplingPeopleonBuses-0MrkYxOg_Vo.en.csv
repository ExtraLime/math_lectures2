Hi.,00:00:00.630,00:00:01.500
"In this problem, we're dealing
with buses of students going",00:00:01.500,00:00:04.750
to a job convention.,00:00:04.750,00:00:06.450
"And in the problem, we'll
be exercising our",00:00:06.450,00:00:10.190
knowledge of PMFs--,00:00:10.190,00:00:11.400
probability mass functions.,00:00:11.400,00:00:13.050
"So we'll get a couple of
opportunities to write out",00:00:13.050,00:00:15.060
"some PMFs, and also calculating
expectations or",00:00:15.060,00:00:18.210
expected values.,00:00:18.210,00:00:19.700
"And also, importantly, we'll
actually be exercising our",00:00:19.700,00:00:22.340
"intuition to help us not just
rely on numbers, but also to",00:00:22.340,00:00:27.510
"just have a sense of what the
answers to some probability",00:00:27.510,00:00:30.850
questions should be.,00:00:30.850,00:00:32.930
"So the problem specifically
deals with",00:00:32.930,00:00:35.850
four buses of students.,00:00:35.850,00:00:37.710
"So we have buses, and in each
one carries a different number",00:00:37.710,00:00:41.070
of students.,00:00:41.070,00:00:41.630
"So the first one carries 40
students, the second one 33,",00:00:41.630,00:00:44.960
"the third one has 25, and the
last one has 50 students for a",00:00:44.960,00:00:48.790
total of 148 students.,00:00:48.790,00:00:54.480
"And because these students
are smart, and they like",00:00:54.480,00:00:56.670
"probability, they are",00:00:56.670,00:00:58.210
interested in a couple questions.,00:00:58.210,00:01:00.170
"So suppose that one of these
148 students is chosen",00:01:00.170,00:01:06.370
"randomly, and so we'll assume
that what that means is that",00:01:06.370,00:01:09.880
"each one has the same
probability of being chosen.",00:01:09.880,00:01:12.360
"So they're chosen uniformly
at random.",00:01:12.360,00:01:15.120
"And let's assign a couple
of random variables.",00:01:15.120,00:01:18.580
"So we'll say x corresponds to
the number of students in the",00:01:18.580,00:01:28.100
bus of the selected student.,00:01:28.100,00:01:40.010
"OK, so one of these 148 students
is selected uniformly",00:01:40.010,00:01:44.830
"at random, and we'll let x
correspond to the number of",00:01:44.830,00:01:47.670
"students in that
student's bus.",00:01:47.670,00:01:51.310
"So if a student from this bus
was chosen, then x would be",00:01:51.310,00:01:55.310
"25, for example.",00:01:55.310,00:01:57.750
"OK, and then let's come up with
another random variable,",00:01:57.750,00:02:00.340
"y, which is almost
the same thing.",00:02:00.340,00:02:04.430
"Except instead of now selecting
a random student,",00:02:04.430,00:02:08.789
we'll select a random bus.,00:02:08.789,00:02:11.920
"Or equivalently, we'll select
a random bus driver.",00:02:11.920,00:02:17.110
"So each bus has one driver, and
instead of selecting one",00:02:17.110,00:02:20.390
"of the 148 students at random,
we'll select one of the four",00:02:20.390,00:02:23.320
"bus drivers also uniformly
at random.",00:02:23.320,00:02:26.620
"And we'll say the number
of students in that",00:02:26.620,00:02:30.110
driver's bus will be y.,00:02:30.110,00:02:32.930
"So for example, if this bus
driver was selected, then y",00:02:32.930,00:02:36.940
would be 33.,00:02:36.940,00:02:38.820
"OK, so the main problem that
we're trying to answer is what",00:02:38.820,00:02:44.640
"do you expect the
expectation--",00:02:44.640,00:02:47.270
"which one of these random
variables do you expect to",00:02:47.270,00:02:48.910
"have the higher expectation or
the higher expected value?",00:02:48.910,00:02:53.050
"So, would you expect
x to be higher on",00:02:53.050,00:02:56.280
"average, or y to be higher?",00:02:56.280,00:02:58.050
"And what would be the
intuition for this?",00:02:58.050,00:03:00.620
"So obviously, we can actually
write out the",00:03:00.620,00:03:02.910
PMFs for x and y.,00:03:02.910,00:03:03.990
"These are just discrete
random variables.",00:03:03.990,00:03:05.780
"And we can actually calculate
out what the expectation is.",00:03:05.780,00:03:08.170
"But it's also useful to exercise
your intuition, and",00:03:08.170,00:03:11.190
"your sense of what the
answer should be.",00:03:11.190,00:03:14.260
"So it might not be immediately
clear which one would be",00:03:14.260,00:03:18.420
"higher, or you might even say
that maybe it doesn't make a",00:03:18.420,00:03:20.640
difference.,00:03:20.640,00:03:21.280
They're actually the same.,00:03:21.280,00:03:23.350
"But a useful way to approach
some of these questions is to",00:03:23.350,00:03:27.800
"try to take things to
the extreme and see",00:03:27.800,00:03:30.360
how that plays out.,00:03:30.360,00:03:31.440
"So let's take the simpler
example and take it to the",00:03:31.440,00:03:33.580
"extreme and say, suppose a set
of four buses carrying these",00:03:33.580,00:03:37.260
number of students.,00:03:37.260,00:03:38.370
We have only two buses--,00:03:38.370,00:03:39.620
"one bus that has only 1 student,
and we have another",00:03:39.620,00:03:49.280
"bus that has 1,000 students.",00:03:49.280,00:03:57.280
OK.,00:03:57.280,00:03:58.370
"And suppose we ask the
same question.",00:03:58.370,00:04:00.840
"Well, now if you look at it,
there's a total of 1,001",00:04:00.840,00:04:05.880
students now.,00:04:05.880,00:04:06.850
"If you select one of the
students at random, it's",00:04:06.850,00:04:10.770
"overwhelmingly more likely that
that student will be one",00:04:10.770,00:04:14.040
"of the 1,000 students
on this huge bus.",00:04:14.040,00:04:17.140
"It's very unlikely that you'll
get lucky and select the one",00:04:17.140,00:04:20.630
student who is by himself.,00:04:20.630,00:04:23.140
"And so because of that, you
have a very high chance of",00:04:23.140,00:04:27.210
"selecting the bus with the
high number of students.",00:04:27.210,00:04:30.930
"And so you would expect
x, the number of",00:04:30.930,00:04:33.710
"students, to be high--",00:04:33.710,00:04:37.490
"to be almost 1,000 in
the expectation.",00:04:37.490,00:04:40.590
"But on the other hand, if you
selected the driver at random,",00:04:40.590,00:04:44.840
"then you have a 50/50
chance of selecting",00:04:44.840,00:04:46.880
this one or that one.,00:04:46.880,00:04:48.430
"And so you would expect the
expectation there to be",00:04:48.430,00:04:54.210
roughly 500 or so.,00:04:54.210,00:04:56.160
"And so you can see that if you
take this to the extreme, then",00:04:56.160,00:04:59.740
"it becomes more clear what
the answer would be.",00:04:59.740,00:05:03.240
"And the argument is that the
expectation of x should be",00:05:03.240,00:05:06.650
"higher than the expectation of
y, and the reason here is that",00:05:06.650,00:05:10.930
"because you select the student
at random, you're more likely",00:05:10.930,00:05:14.250
"to select a student who is in a
large bus, because that bus",00:05:14.250,00:05:18.410
"just has more students
to select from.",00:05:18.410,00:05:20.920
"And because of that, you're
more biased in favor of",00:05:20.920,00:05:23.910
"selecting large buses, and
therefore, that makes x higher",00:05:23.910,00:05:27.980
in expectation.,00:05:27.980,00:05:29.910
"OK, so that's the intuition
behind this problem.",00:05:29.910,00:05:32.580
"And now, as I actually go
through some of the more",00:05:32.580,00:05:34.240
"mechanics and write out what the
PMFs and the calculation",00:05:34.240,00:05:38.100
"for the expectation would be to
verify that our intuition",00:05:38.100,00:05:40.640
is actually correct.,00:05:40.640,00:05:42.400
"OK, so we have two random
variables that are defined.",00:05:42.400,00:05:46.020
"Now let's just write out
what their PMFs are.",00:05:46.020,00:05:48.940
So the PMF--,00:05:48.940,00:05:51.270
"we write it as little P of
capital X and little x.",00:05:51.270,00:05:58.240
"So the random variable-- what
we do is we say the",00:05:58.240,00:06:00.740
"probability that it will take
on a certain value, right?",00:06:00.740,00:06:03.970
"So what is the probability
that x will be 40?",00:06:03.970,00:06:09.210
"Well, x will be 40
if a student from",00:06:09.210,00:06:13.030
this bus was selected.,00:06:13.030,00:06:14.810
"And what's the probability that
a student from this bus",00:06:14.810,00:06:16.870
is selected?,00:06:16.870,00:06:17.570
"That probability is 40/148,
because there's 148 students,",00:06:17.570,00:06:23.230
"40 of whom are sitting
in this bus.",00:06:23.230,00:06:27.160
"And similarly, x will be 33 with
probability 33/148, and x",00:06:27.160,00:06:35.470
"will be 25 with probability
25/148.",00:06:35.470,00:06:40.750
"And x will be 50 with
probability 50/148.",00:06:40.750,00:06:45.120
And it will be 0 otherwise.,00:06:45.120,00:06:47.030
 ,00:06:47.030,00:06:51.750
"OK, so there is our PMF for
x, and we can do the",00:06:51.750,00:06:57.440
same thing for y.,00:06:57.440,00:06:59.920
The PMF of y--,00:06:59.920,00:07:02.060
"again, we say what is the
probability that y will take",00:07:02.060,00:07:05.160
on certain values?,00:07:05.160,00:07:06.150
"Well, y can take on the same
values as x can, because we're",00:07:06.150,00:07:09.900
"still dealing with the number
of students in each bus.",00:07:09.900,00:07:12.580
So y can be 40.,00:07:12.580,00:07:14.910
"But the probability that y is
40, because we're selecting",00:07:14.910,00:07:17.390
"the driver at random
now, is 1/4, right?",00:07:17.390,00:07:20.290
"Because there's a 1/4 chance
that we'll pick this driver.",00:07:20.290,00:07:23.260
"And the probability that y will
be 33 will also be 1/4,",00:07:23.260,00:07:27.960
"and the same thing
for 25 and 50.",00:07:27.960,00:07:35.840
And it's 0 otherwise.,00:07:35.840,00:07:42.260
"OK, so those are the PMFs
for our two random",00:07:42.260,00:07:49.690
"variables, x and y.",00:07:49.690,00:07:51.950
"And we can also draw out what
the PMFs look like.",00:07:51.950,00:07:55.630
"So if this is 25, 30, 35,
40, 45, and 50, then the",00:07:55.630,00:08:14.730
"probability that it's
25 is 25/148.",00:08:14.730,00:08:17.650
"So we can draw a mass
right there.",00:08:17.650,00:08:21.290
"For 33, it's a little
higher, because it's",00:08:21.290,00:08:24.130
33/148 instead of 25.,00:08:24.130,00:08:27.440
"For 40, it's even
higher still.",00:08:27.440,00:08:29.260
It's 40/148.,00:08:29.260,00:08:30.220
"And for 50, it is still higher,
because it is 50/148.",00:08:30.220,00:08:39.380
"And so you can see that the PMF
is more heavily favored",00:08:39.380,00:08:44.620
towards the larger values.,00:08:44.620,00:08:47.410
"We can do the same thing for
y, and we'll notice that",00:08:47.410,00:08:51.610
"there's a difference in how
these distributions look.",00:08:51.610,00:08:54.690
 ,00:08:54.690,00:09:00.460
"So if we do the same thing, the
difference now is that all",00:09:00.460,00:09:05.280
"four of these masses will
have the same height.",00:09:05.280,00:09:11.500
"Each one will have height 1/4,
whereas this one for x, it's",00:09:11.500,00:09:16.240
"more heavily biased in favor
of the larger ones.",00:09:16.240,00:09:18.710
"And so because of that, we can
actually now calculate what",00:09:18.710,00:09:21.410
"the expectations are and figure
out whether or not our",00:09:21.410,00:09:24.740
intuition was correct.,00:09:24.740,00:09:27.600
"OK, so now let's actually
calculate out what these",00:09:27.600,00:09:30.760
expectations are.,00:09:30.760,00:09:33.610
"So as you recall, the
expectation is calculated out",00:09:33.610,00:09:37.880
as a weighted sum.,00:09:37.880,00:09:39.830
"So for each possible value of x,
you take that value and you",00:09:39.830,00:09:45.490
"weight it by the probability of
the random variable taking",00:09:45.490,00:09:50.070
on that value.,00:09:50.070,00:09:52.080
"So in this case, it would be
40 times 40/148, 33 times",00:09:52.080,00:09:59.920
"33/148, and so on.",00:09:59.920,00:10:10.650
"48 plus 25 times 25/148
plus 50 times 50/148.",00:10:10.650,00:10:20.760
"And if you do out this
calculation, what you'll get",00:10:20.760,00:10:25.810
is that it is around 39.,00:10:25.810,00:10:30.820
Roughly 39.,00:10:30.820,00:10:33.070
"And now we can do the
same thing for y.",00:10:33.070,00:10:36.910
"But for y, it's different,
because now instead of",00:10:36.910,00:10:41.650
"weighting it by these
probabilities, we'll weight it",00:10:41.650,00:10:44.650
by these probabilities.,00:10:44.650,00:10:45.920
"So each one has the same
weight of 1/4.",00:10:45.920,00:10:48.600
"So now we get 40 times 1/4
plus 33 times 1/4.",00:10:48.600,00:10:55.390
"That's 25 times 1/4
plus 50 times 1/4.",00:10:55.390,00:11:01.130
"And if you do out this
arithmetic, what you get is",00:11:01.130,00:11:06.030
that this expectation is 37.,00:11:06.030,00:11:10.310
"And so what we get is that, in
fact, after we do out the",00:11:10.310,00:11:13.930
"calculations, the expected value
of x is indeed greater",00:11:13.930,00:11:17.090
"than the expected value of y,
which confirms our intuition.",00:11:17.090,00:11:20.110
"OK, so this problem, to
summarize-- we've reviewed how",00:11:20.110,00:11:24.310
"to write out a PMF and also how
to calculate expectations.",00:11:24.310,00:11:27.650
"But also, we've got a chance to
figure out some intuition",00:11:27.650,00:11:33.540
behind some of these problems.,00:11:33.540,00:11:35.840
"And so sometimes it's helpful
to take simpler things and",00:11:35.840,00:11:39.480
"take things to the extreme and
figure out intuitively whether",00:11:39.480,00:11:42.250
or not the answer makes sense.,00:11:42.250,00:11:43.520
"It's useful just to verify
whether the numerical answer",00:11:43.520,00:11:47.530
"that you get in the
end is correct.",00:11:47.530,00:11:48.950
Does this actually make sense?,00:11:48.950,00:11:50.440
"It's a useful guide for when
you're solving these problems.",00:11:50.440,00:11:53.850
"OK, so we'll see you next time.",00:11:53.850,00:11:55.310
 ,00:11:55.310,00:11:56.560
