"PROFESSOR: Hi, guys.",00:00:05.688,00:00:08.300
"My name is Nikola,
and in this video,",00:00:08.300,00:00:10.830
"we're going to
work out an example",00:00:10.830,00:00:12.300
"of an orthogonal
projection matrix.",00:00:12.300,00:00:14.680
"Specifically, we are gonna
compute the projection matrix",00:00:14.680,00:00:18.540
"onto the plane given by the
equation x plus y minus z",00:00:18.540,00:00:22.100
equals 0.,00:00:22.100,00:00:23.480
"So before we start,
let me just recall",00:00:23.480,00:00:27.060
what a projection matrix is.,00:00:27.060,00:00:29.350
"So you've seen this sketch
here a million times already.",00:00:29.350,00:00:35.170
"A projection matrix takes any
vector in three-space-- well,",00:00:35.170,00:00:42.000
"just in this case, we are
dealing with a three-space--",00:00:42.000,00:00:44.750
"and projects it
down onto the plane,",00:00:44.750,00:00:49.640
"a two-dimensional
subspace of R^3.",00:00:49.640,00:00:52.840
"So I'll give you a few
moments to consider",00:00:52.840,00:00:56.850
the problem for yourselves.,00:00:56.850,00:00:58.120
"And then you'll
see my take on it.",00:00:58.120,00:01:00.640
Hi again.,00:01:10.657,00:01:12.900
"So in lecture, Professor Strang
derived, in meticulous detail,",00:01:12.900,00:01:19.120
"the formula for the
projection matrix.",00:01:19.120,00:01:21.990
"So it was given by the
following slightly complicated",00:01:21.990,00:01:27.850
expression.,00:01:27.850,00:01:28.900
"It's A times A
transpose A inverse A",00:01:28.900,00:01:36.240
"transpose where A
is a matrix that",00:01:36.240,00:01:40.050
"somehow encodes the subspace
we're projecting on.",00:01:40.050,00:01:45.320
"In particular, A has, as
its columns, a_1, a_2,",00:01:45.320,00:01:53.820
"I'm going to denote them--
a basis for the plane we're",00:01:53.820,00:01:57.510
projecting on.,00:01:57.510,00:02:00.080
"So essentially,
what we need to do",00:02:00.080,00:02:03.340
"is find two such vectors
that span the plane and start",00:02:03.340,00:02:08.979
computing with a matrix.,00:02:08.979,00:02:12.490
This is fairly straightforward.,00:02:12.490,00:02:13.960
"One choice that works,
for example, is [1, -1, 0]",00:02:18.320,00:02:24.220
"for the first column, and [1, 0,
 1] for the second column.",00:02:24.220,00:02:31.970
"And let me write out the
matrix A. So in the formula,",00:02:35.430,00:02:51.500
"the slightly more
complicated combination",00:02:51.500,00:02:54.640
"is A transpose A inverse, so let
me compute that first for you.",00:02:54.640,00:03:00.270
"So A transpose A
is a 2 by 2 matrix.",00:03:00.270,00:03:08.900
"And it's not so hard to figure
out that it's 2 and 1; 1, 2.",00:03:08.900,00:03:18.780
"Now we shall invert it
using the familiar formula.",00:03:18.780,00:03:29.100
1 over the determinant.,00:03:29.100,00:03:31.190
2 times 2 minus 1 is 3.,00:03:31.190,00:03:34.260
"And so we switch the
diagonal entries,",00:03:34.260,00:03:40.450
"and we flip the signs of
the off-diagonal ones.",00:03:40.450,00:03:42.533
Right.,00:03:45.410,00:03:46.620
"And therefore, projection
matrix is given by the following",00:03:46.620,00:03:53.240
"product of matrices:
...1/3, [2, -1; -1,",00:03:53.240,00:04:12.140
"2] and then transpose of A,
which is [1, -1, 0; 1, 0, 1].",00:04:12.140,00:04:22.239
"I'm gonna carry out
this multiplication",00:04:25.650,00:04:28.340
in inhumanly fast fashion.,00:04:28.340,00:04:31.650
"So I'm just gonna write down
the answer, which is 1/3",00:04:31.650,00:04:38.140
"[2, -1, 1; -1, 2, 2; 1, 1, 1].",00:04:38.140,00:04:45.070
"So what you can
do now is-- well,",00:04:48.680,00:04:51.740
"you can check whether this
answer actually makes sense.",00:04:51.740,00:04:56.680
"One thing you can
do is just-- well,",00:04:56.680,00:04:59.540
"a projection matrix is
supposed to take the normal",00:04:59.540,00:05:03.770
to the plane down to 0.,00:05:03.770,00:05:06.090
"So you can just multiply P and
the normal vector [1, 1, -1].",00:05:06.090,00:05:14.090
"And if you get 0, maybe
you've done a good job.",00:05:14.090,00:05:18.700
"Another curious thing that I
would like to point out here",00:05:18.700,00:05:21.940
"is: so you see we had
lots of freedom choosing",00:05:21.940,00:05:26.310
"the matrix A. We could have
chosen any two columns that",00:05:26.310,00:05:31.450
"span the subspace,
that spans the plane.",00:05:31.450,00:05:36.060
"The beautiful thing about
it is that in the end,",00:05:36.060,00:05:38.660
we'll get the same answer.,00:05:38.660,00:05:40.130
"So I hope there
will be many of you",00:05:44.510,00:05:46.880
"who would say, hey, there is an
easier way to do the problem.",00:05:46.880,00:05:51.870
"And I'll agree
with these people.",00:05:51.870,00:05:53.600
"So let's see what would
be an easier approach.",00:05:53.600,00:06:01.590
"Well, let's go back
to the sketch here.",00:06:01.590,00:06:08.450
"And let's make the
following observation,",00:06:08.450,00:06:11.290
"that any vector is a
sum of two components.",00:06:11.290,00:06:16.970
"The first component is its
projection onto the plane.",00:06:16.970,00:06:22.540
"And the other component
is its projection",00:06:22.540,00:06:25.820
"onto the orthogonal complement
of the plane, in this case,",00:06:25.820,00:06:29.040
"onto the normal vector
through the plane.",00:06:29.040,00:06:31.620
"So in the language
of linear algebra,",00:06:31.620,00:06:35.050
"this is just b equals
to its projection",00:06:35.050,00:06:41.660
"onto the plane plus
its projection-- I'm",00:06:41.660,00:06:45.850
"gonna call it P_N-- onto
the orthogonal complement",00:06:45.850,00:06:48.760
of the plane.,00:06:48.760,00:06:49.700
"I'm gonna suggestively
write here the identity",00:06:52.650,00:06:56.580
"matrix so that you
can immediately",00:06:56.580,00:06:59.520
read off a matrix equality.,00:06:59.520,00:07:01.510
"Associated with this
equality here, it's",00:07:01.510,00:07:05.100
the identity equals P plus P_N.,00:07:05.100,00:07:10.770
"And therefore, the
projection matrix",00:07:10.770,00:07:14.410
"is just the identity minus
the projection matrix",00:07:14.410,00:07:17.930
onto the normal vector.,00:07:17.930,00:07:20.510
"Now, this object here, P_N, is
much easier to compute, well,",00:07:20.510,00:07:27.450
for two reasons.,00:07:27.450,00:07:28.910
"First one is that projecting
onto a one-dimensional subspace",00:07:28.910,00:07:33.150
"is infinitely easier
than projecting",00:07:33.150,00:07:36.210
"onto a higher-dimensional
subspace.",00:07:36.210,00:07:38.350
"And second, we already
have-- well, immediately we",00:07:38.350,00:07:43.830
"can read off from the
equation of the plane what",00:07:43.830,00:07:46.080
the normal vector is.,00:07:46.080,00:07:47.750
"So we don't have
derive these guys.",00:07:47.750,00:07:52.570
"We don't have to do
what we did here.",00:07:52.570,00:07:56.250
"So essentially, P_N will be
N N transpose N inverse N",00:07:56.250,00:08:12.401
transpose.,00:08:12.401,00:08:12.900
"And that's equal to [1, 1, -1]--
N transpose N inverse,",00:08:16.050,00:08:30.730
this is just a number.,00:08:30.730,00:08:33.669
"It's 1 over the magnitude
of the normal vector,",00:08:33.669,00:08:37.890
"so that's-- then, the
magnitude squared, so that's 3.",00:08:37.890,00:08:41.766
"And 1, 1, -1.",00:08:41.766,00:08:45.105
I'm gonna write the answer here.,00:08:48.510,00:08:55.030
"It's 1/3, 1, 1, -1; 1,
1, -1; and -1, 1, 1.",00:08:55.030,00:09:13.953
"And in order to get the
projection matrix-- yes?",00:09:25.070,00:09:28.773
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:09:28.773,00:09:30.505
PROFESSOR: Oh.,00:09:30.505,00:09:32.430
Thank you.,00:09:32.430,00:09:33.270
Thank you.,00:09:33.270,00:09:34.320
"And in order to get
the projection matrix,",00:09:34.320,00:09:37.520
"we just subtract from the
identity this expression.",00:09:37.520,00:09:41.750
"And you can confirm that it's--
we get the same answer as here.",00:09:41.750,00:09:48.170
I think we're done here.,00:09:48.170,00:09:49.878
