"ANA BELL: So we have a class
Car here, object as usual.",00:00:23.520,00:00:29.520
"The init method here takes in
self as usual, a w, and a d.",00:00:29.520,00:00:35.260
"So Car gets initialized
with two parameters.",00:00:35.260,00:00:39.470
"And we assign the wheels data
attribute to the first one",00:00:39.470,00:00:42.260
"and the doors data
attribute to the second one.",00:00:42.260,00:00:44.990
"And then we're
going to also assign",00:00:44.990,00:00:46.700
"the color data attribute
to be the empty string.",00:00:46.700,00:00:50.460
"So I'm giving you
four choices here.",00:00:50.460,00:00:52.042
"And the question says,
which of the above",00:00:52.042,00:00:53.750
"is a getter method for
the number of wheels?",00:00:53.750,00:00:57.140
"So getter method
is something that's",00:00:57.140,00:00:59.840
going to get a data attribute.,00:00:59.840,00:01:02.250
"A method is really
just a function.",00:01:02.250,00:01:03.900
"So of course, we're
going to have def.",00:01:03.900,00:01:07.110
"get_wheels is a
good name for it.",00:01:07.110,00:01:10.040
"Since it's a method
for this class,",00:01:10.040,00:01:11.610
"we have to have self
in the parameters.",00:01:11.610,00:01:14.520
"So we know it's going
to be between C and D.",00:01:14.520,00:01:17.790
"And so then what are
we going to return?",00:01:17.790,00:01:19.950
"The first one's going
to return wheels, which,",00:01:19.950,00:01:23.547
"in this particular
case, is just going",00:01:23.547,00:01:25.130
"to be a variable that we haven't
defined, but it's a variable.",00:01:25.130,00:01:29.080
"A getter returns
a data attribute",00:01:29.080,00:01:31.310
of a particular instance.,00:01:31.310,00:01:33.270
"So we actually have
to say self dot",00:01:33.270,00:01:35.990
"if we want to return a data
attribute of an instance,",00:01:35.990,00:01:38.400
"as opposed to just
a regular variable.",00:01:38.400,00:01:40.370
"So the correct answer
is D. Great job.",00:01:40.370,00:01:45.110
