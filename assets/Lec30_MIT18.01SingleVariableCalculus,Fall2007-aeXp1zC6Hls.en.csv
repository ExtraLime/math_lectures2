"PROFESSOR: Now, to start out
today we're going to finish up",00:00:23.080,00:00:26.390
what we did last time.,00:00:26.390,00:00:27.850
"Which has to do with
partial fractions.",00:00:27.850,00:00:30.950
"I told you how to do partial
fractions in several special",00:00:30.950,00:00:34.160
"cases and everybody was trying
to figure out what the general",00:00:34.160,00:00:36.690
picture was.,00:00:36.690,00:00:37.920
But I'd like to lay that out.,00:00:37.920,00:00:39.180
"I'll still only do it
for an example.",00:00:39.180,00:00:41.730
"But it will be somehow a bigger
example so that you can",00:00:41.730,00:00:44.300
"see what the general
pattern is.",00:00:44.300,00:00:53.310
"Partial fractions, remember,
is a method for breaking up",00:00:53.310,00:01:04.280
so-called rational functions.,00:01:04.280,00:01:06.730
"Which are ratios
of polynomials.",00:01:06.730,00:01:09.510
"And it shows you that you can
always integrate them.",00:01:09.510,00:01:13.110
That's really the theme here.,00:01:13.110,00:01:14.920
"And this is what's reassuring
is that it always works.",00:01:14.920,00:01:21.190
That's really the bottom line.,00:01:21.190,00:01:23.670
"And that's good because there
are a lot of integrals that",00:01:23.670,00:01:28.150
"don't have formulas
and these do.",00:01:28.150,00:01:34.100
It always works.,00:01:34.100,00:01:35.560
"But, maybe with lots of help.",00:01:35.560,00:01:43.340
So maybe slowly.,00:01:43.340,00:01:46.570
"Now, there's a little bit of
bad news, and I have to be",00:01:46.570,00:01:48.830
"totally honest and tell you
what all the bad news is.",00:01:48.830,00:01:52.230
Along with the good news.,00:01:52.230,00:01:54.930
"The first step, which maybe I
should be calling Step 0, I",00:01:54.930,00:02:00.180
"had a Step 1, 2 and 3 last
time, is long division.",00:02:00.180,00:02:08.710
"That's the step where you take
your polynomial divided by",00:02:08.710,00:02:11.920
"your other polynomial,
and you find the",00:02:11.920,00:02:14.760
quotient plus some remainder.,00:02:14.760,00:02:22.470
"And you do that by
long division.",00:02:22.470,00:02:24.370
"And the quotient is easy to take
the antiderivative of up",00:02:24.370,00:02:28.120
"because it's just
a polynomial.",00:02:28.120,00:02:30.010
"And the key extra property here
is that the degree of the",00:02:30.010,00:02:33.950
"numerator now over here, this
remainder, is strictly less",00:02:33.950,00:02:37.350
"than the degree of
the denominator.",00:02:37.350,00:02:40.510
"So that you can do
the next step.",00:02:40.510,00:02:44.140
"Now, the next step which I
called Step 1 last time,",00:02:44.140,00:02:48.580
"that's great imagination, it's
right after Step 0, Step 1 was",00:02:48.580,00:02:52.500
to factor the denominator.,00:02:52.500,00:02:54.930
"And I'm going to illustrate
by example what",00:02:54.930,00:02:58.740
the setup is here.,00:02:58.740,00:03:00.630
"I don't know maybe,
we'll do this.",00:03:00.630,00:03:09.120
"Some polynomial here,
maybe cube this one.",00:03:09.120,00:03:12.920
"So here I've factored
the denominator.",00:03:12.920,00:03:21.440
"That's what I called
Step 1 last time.",00:03:21.440,00:03:24.840
"Now, here's the first
piece of bad news.",00:03:24.840,00:03:27.650
"In reality, if somebody gave you
a multiplied out degree,",00:03:27.650,00:03:33.130
"whatever polynomial here,
you would be very hard",00:03:33.130,00:03:36.900
pressed to factor it.,00:03:36.900,00:03:40.710
"A lot of them are extremely
difficult to factor.",00:03:40.710,00:03:44.300
"And so that's something you
would have to give to a",00:03:44.300,00:03:46.090
machine to do.,00:03:46.090,00:03:47.940
"And it's just basically
a hard problem.",00:03:47.940,00:03:50.880
"So obviously, we're only going
to give you ones that you can",00:03:50.880,00:03:54.790
do by hand.,00:03:54.790,00:03:55.480
So very low degree examples.,00:03:55.480,00:03:58.060
And that's just the way it is.,00:03:58.060,00:03:59.320
"So this is really a hard step
in disguise, in real life.",00:03:59.320,00:04:03.600
"Anyway, we're just going
to take it as given.",00:04:03.600,00:04:06.000
"And we have this numerator,
which is of degree less than",00:04:06.000,00:04:09.130
the denominator.,00:04:09.130,00:04:10.720
"So let's count up what
its degree has to be.",00:04:10.720,00:04:14.830
This is 4 + 2 + 6.,00:04:14.830,00:04:18.640
So this is degree 4 + 2 + 6.,00:04:18.640,00:04:22.440
"I added that up because this is
degree 4, this is degree 2",00:04:22.440,00:04:25.720
"and (x ^2) ^3 is
the 6th power.",00:04:25.720,00:04:28.600
"So all together it's
this, which is 12.",00:04:28.600,00:04:32.330
"And so this thing is
of degree &lt;= 11.",00:04:32.330,00:04:39.860
"All the way up to degree 11,
that's the possibilities for",00:04:39.860,00:04:42.250
the numerator here.,00:04:42.250,00:04:44.240
"Now, the extra information that
I want to impart right",00:04:44.240,00:04:48.780
"now, is just this setup.",00:04:48.780,00:04:56.450
"Which I called Step
2 last time.",00:04:56.450,00:04:58.990
And the setup is this.,00:04:58.990,00:05:05.260
"Now, it's going to take
us a while to do this.",00:05:05.260,00:05:07.590
We have this factor here.,00:05:07.590,00:05:10.810
We have another factor.,00:05:10.810,00:05:12.450
"We have another term,
with the square.",00:05:12.450,00:05:14.620
"We have another term
with the cube.",00:05:14.620,00:05:18.220
"We have another term with
the fourth power.",00:05:18.220,00:05:22.810
"So this is what's going to
happen whenever you have",00:05:22.810,00:05:24.640
linear factors.,00:05:24.640,00:05:25.530
"You'll have a collection
of terms like this.",00:05:25.530,00:05:28.560
"So you have four constants
to take care of.",00:05:28.560,00:05:31.030
"Now, with a quadratic in the
denominator, you need a linear",00:05:31.030,00:05:35.610
function in the numerator.,00:05:35.610,00:05:36.840
"So that's, if you like, B0
x + C0 divided by this",00:05:36.840,00:05:42.250
quadratic term here.,00:05:42.250,00:05:49.370
"And what I didn't show you last
time was how you deal",00:05:49.370,00:05:53.910
"with higher powers of
quadratic terms.",00:05:53.910,00:05:59.720
"So when you have a quadratic
term, what's going to happen",00:05:59.720,00:06:04.090
"is you're going to take that
first factor here.",00:06:04.090,00:06:07.370
"Just the way you did
in this case.",00:06:07.370,00:06:11.870
"But then you're going to have to
do the same thing with the",00:06:11.870,00:06:15.780
next power.,00:06:15.780,00:06:24.120
"Now notice, just as in the case
of this top row, I have",00:06:24.120,00:06:28.640
just a constant here.,00:06:28.640,00:06:29.830
"And even though I increased the
degree of the denominator",00:06:29.830,00:06:33.030
"I'm not increasing
the numerator.",00:06:33.030,00:06:34.540
It's staying just a constant.,00:06:34.540,00:06:35.970
It's not linear up here.,00:06:35.970,00:06:38.230
It's better than that.,00:06:38.230,00:06:39.850
It's just a constant.,00:06:39.850,00:06:41.990
And here it stayed a constant.,00:06:41.990,00:06:44.130
And here I stayed a constant.,00:06:44.130,00:06:45.630
"Similarly here, even though I'm
increasing the degree of",00:06:45.630,00:06:48.640
"the denominator, I'm leaving the
numerator, the form of the",00:06:48.640,00:06:51.550
"numerator, alone.",00:06:51.550,00:06:52.810
"It's just a linear factor
and a linear factor.",00:06:52.810,00:06:55.150
"So that's the key
to this pattern.",00:06:55.150,00:07:05.350
"I don't have quite as jazzy
a song on mine.",00:07:05.350,00:07:09.850
"So this is so long that it runs
off the blackboard here.",00:07:09.850,00:07:13.410
"So let's continue
it on the next.",00:07:13.410,00:07:15.820
"We've got this B2 x + C2
- sorry, B3 x + C3",00:07:15.820,00:07:21.535
/ (x ^2 + 4) ^3.,00:07:21.535,00:07:26.590
"I guess I have room
for it over here.",00:07:26.590,00:07:38.590
"I'm going to talk about
this in just a second.",00:07:38.590,00:07:41.120
"Alright, so here's
the pattern.",00:07:41.120,00:07:43.590
"Now, let me just do a count
of the number of",00:07:43.590,00:07:50.610
unknowns we have here.,00:07:50.610,00:07:52.410
"The number of unknowns that we
have here is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,",00:07:52.410,00:07:56.480
"7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.",00:07:56.480,00:07:58.750
That 12 is no coincidence.,00:07:58.750,00:08:00.930
"That's the degree of
the polynomial.",00:08:00.930,00:08:03.960
"And it's the number of unknowns
that we have. And",00:08:03.960,00:08:05.950
"it's the number of degrees
of freedom in a",00:08:05.950,00:08:09.140
polynomial of degree 11.,00:08:09.140,00:08:11.370
"If you have all these free
coefficients here, you have",00:08:11.370,00:08:13.310
"the coefficient x^ 0, x ^ 1,
all the way up to x^ 11.",00:08:13.310,00:08:17.560
"And 0 through 11 is 12 different
coefficients.",00:08:17.560,00:08:23.100
"And so this is a very
complicated system of",00:08:23.100,00:08:26.490
equations for unknowns.,00:08:26.490,00:08:28.150
"This is twelve equations
for twelve unknowns.",00:08:28.150,00:08:33.410
"So I'll get rid of this
for a second.",00:08:33.410,00:08:34.800
"So we have twelve equations,
twelve unknowns.",00:08:34.800,00:08:41.090
So that's the other bad news.,00:08:41.090,00:08:43.830
"Machines handle this very well,
but human beings have a",00:08:43.830,00:08:46.210
little trouble with 12.,00:08:46.210,00:08:47.630
"Now, the cover-up method works
very neatly and picks",00:08:47.630,00:08:52.030
out this term here.,00:08:52.030,00:08:53.730
But that's it.,00:08:53.730,00:08:54.470
"So it reduces it
to an 11 by 11.",00:08:54.470,00:08:56.550
"You'll be able to evaluate
this in no time.",00:08:56.550,00:09:00.170
But that's it.,00:09:00.170,00:09:00.890
"That's the only simplification
of your previous method.",00:09:00.890,00:09:04.240
"We don't have a method
for this.",00:09:04.240,00:09:06.250
"So I'm just showing what the
whole method looks like but",00:09:06.250,00:09:08.870
"really you'd have to have a
machine to implement this once",00:09:08.870,00:09:11.320
it gets to be any size at all.,00:09:11.320,00:09:14.760
"Yeah, question.",00:09:14.760,00:09:15.490
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:09:15.490,00:09:18.060
"PROFESSOR: It's one big
equation, but it's a",00:09:18.060,00:09:23.280
polynomial equation.,00:09:23.280,00:09:24.920
"So there's an equation, there's
this function r ( x) =",00:09:24.920,00:09:30.710
"a11 x^2 11 + a10 x^ 10... and
these things are known.",00:09:30.710,00:09:41.350
"This is a known expression
here.",00:09:41.350,00:09:43.495
"And then when you cross-multiply
on the other",00:09:43.495,00:09:45.730
"side, what you have is, well,
it's a1 times, if you cancel",00:09:45.730,00:09:52.430
"this denominator with that,
you're going to get (x + 2) ^3",00:09:52.430,00:09:58.410
"( x ^2 + 2x + 3)( x^2 + 4)^3
+ the term for a2, etc.",00:09:58.410,00:10:08.260
It's a monster equation.,00:10:08.260,00:10:10.350
"And then to separate it out into
separate equations, you",00:10:10.350,00:10:12.760
"take the coefficient on x^ 11th,
x ^ 10, ... all the way",00:10:12.760,00:10:19.550
down to x^ 0.,00:10:19.550,00:10:21.670
"And all told, that means there
are a total of 12 equations.",00:10:21.670,00:10:27.280
11 through 0 is 12 equations.,00:10:27.280,00:10:31.030
"Yeah, another question.",00:10:31.030,00:10:35.030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:10:35.030,00:10:35.560
"PROFESSOR: Should I write
down rest of this?",00:10:35.560,00:10:38.370
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:10:38.370,00:10:38.610
"PROFESSOR: Should you write
down all this stuff?",00:10:38.610,00:10:40.820
"Well, that's a good question.",00:10:40.820,00:10:43.950
"So you notice I didn't
write it down.",00:10:43.950,00:10:46.070
Why didn't I write it down?,00:10:46.070,00:10:47.300
Because it's incredibly long.,00:10:47.300,00:10:50.200
"In fact, you probably,
so how many pages of",00:10:50.200,00:10:53.790
writing would this take?,00:10:53.790,00:10:54.770
"This is about a page
of writing.",00:10:54.770,00:10:56.210
"So just think of your machine,
how much time you want to",00:10:56.210,00:10:59.270
spend on this.,00:10:59.270,00:11:01.660
"So the answer is that you
have to be realistic.",00:11:01.660,00:11:05.430
"You're a human being,
not a machine.",00:11:05.430,00:11:07.420
"And so there's certain things
that you can write down and",00:11:07.420,00:11:10.170
"other things you should
attempt to write down.",00:11:10.170,00:11:12.510
So do not do this at home.,00:11:12.510,00:11:17.770
"So that's the first down-side
to this method.",00:11:17.770,00:11:21.180
"It gets more and more
complicated as time goes on.",00:11:21.180,00:11:24.350
"The second down-side, I want to
point out to you, is what's",00:11:24.350,00:11:28.770
happening with the pieces.,00:11:28.770,00:11:35.100
"So the pieces still need
to be integrated.",00:11:35.100,00:11:42.830
"We simplified this problem, but
we didn't get rid of it.",00:11:42.830,00:11:48.130
"We still have the problem of
integrating the pieces.",00:11:48.130,00:11:50.890
"Now, some of the pieces
are very easy.",00:11:50.890,00:11:52.740
"This top row here, the
antiderivatives of these, you",00:11:52.740,00:11:55.640
can just write down.,00:11:55.640,00:11:59.150
By advanced guessing.,00:11:59.150,00:12:01.390
"I'm going to skip
over to the most",00:12:01.390,00:12:02.970
complicated one over here.,00:12:02.970,00:12:04.300
For one second here.,00:12:04.300,00:12:06.220
"And what is it that you'd have
to deal with for that one.",00:12:06.220,00:12:09.240
"You'd have to deal with, for
example, so e.g., for example,",00:12:09.240,00:12:14.710
"I need to deal with
the this guy.",00:12:14.710,00:12:21.660
"I've got to get this
antiderivative here.",00:12:21.660,00:12:26.590
"Now, this one you're supposed
to be able to know.",00:12:26.590,00:12:29.130
"So this is why I'm
mentioning this.",00:12:29.130,00:12:30.430
"Because this kind of ingredient
is something you",00:12:30.430,00:12:33.380
already covered.,00:12:33.380,00:12:34.860
And what is it?,00:12:34.860,00:12:35.740
"Well, you do this one by
advanced guessing, although",00:12:35.740,00:12:39.290
"you it as the method
of substitution.",00:12:39.290,00:12:42.000
"You realize that it's going to
be of the form (x^2 + 4) ^ -",00:12:42.000,00:12:47.260
"2, roughly speaking.",00:12:47.260,00:12:49.400
"And now we're going
to fix that.",00:12:49.400,00:12:51.170
"Because if you differentiate it
you get 2x (-2), that's - 4",00:12:51.170,00:12:55.780
(x)(x) times this.,00:12:55.780,00:12:56.410
"There's an x in the
numerator here.",00:12:56.410,00:12:58.370
"So it's - 1/4 of that
will fix the factor.",00:12:58.370,00:13:02.600
"And here's the answer
for that one.",00:13:02.600,00:13:06.550
So that's one you can do.,00:13:06.550,00:13:10.560
The second piece is this guy.,00:13:10.560,00:13:19.020
This is the other piece.,00:13:19.020,00:13:20.480
"Now, this was the piece
that came from B3.",00:13:20.480,00:13:25.680
"This is the one that
came from B3.",00:13:25.680,00:13:27.170
"And this is the one that's
coming from C3.",00:13:27.170,00:13:30.430
This is coming from C3.,00:13:30.430,00:13:32.360
"We still need to get
this one out there.",00:13:32.360,00:13:35.000
"So C3 times that will be the
correct answer, once we've",00:13:35.000,00:13:37.970
found these numbers.,00:13:37.970,00:13:40.960
So how do we do this?,00:13:40.960,00:13:44.160
How's this one integrated?,00:13:44.160,00:13:45.490
STUDENT: Trig substitution?,00:13:45.490,00:13:49.690
PROFESSOR: Trig substitution.,00:13:49.690,00:13:51.640
"So the trig substitution
here is x = 2 tan u.",00:13:51.640,00:13:57.630
Or 2 tan theta.,00:13:57.630,00:14:00.800
"And when you do that, there
are a couple of",00:14:00.800,00:14:02.430
simplifications.,00:14:02.430,00:14:03.860
"Well, I wouldn't call this
a simplification.",00:14:03.860,00:14:06.450
"This is just the differentiation
formula. dx =",00:14:06.450,00:14:11.330
2 sec^2 u du.,00:14:11.330,00:14:14.830
"And then you have to plug in,
and you're using the fact that",00:14:14.830,00:14:19.030
"when you plug in the tan^2,
4 tan ^2 + 4,",00:14:19.030,00:14:22.960
you'll get a sec ^2.,00:14:22.960,00:14:24.370
"So altogether, this thing
is, 2 sec^2 u du.",00:14:24.370,00:14:32.240
"And then there's a (4 sec^2
u) ^3, in the denominator.",00:14:32.240,00:14:40.300
"So that's what happens when
you change variables here.",00:14:40.300,00:14:44.340
"And now look, this
keeps on going.",00:14:44.340,00:14:46.790
"This is not the end
of the problem.",00:14:46.790,00:14:49.120
"Because what does that
simplify to?",00:14:49.120,00:14:50.790
"That is, let's see, it's
2/64, the integral",00:14:50.790,00:14:55.610
of sec^6 and sec^2.,00:14:55.610,00:14:58.620
That's the same as cos^4.,00:14:58.620,00:15:00.090
"And now, you did a trig
substitution but you still",00:15:04.300,00:15:06.780
have a trig integral.,00:15:06.780,00:15:11.140
"The trig integral now, there's
a method for this.",00:15:11.140,00:15:15.540
"The method for this is when it's
an even power, you have",00:15:15.540,00:15:19.060
"to use the double
angle formula.",00:15:19.060,00:15:22.280
So that's this guy here.,00:15:22.280,00:15:31.890
And you're still not done.,00:15:31.890,00:15:33.470
"You have to square
this thing out.",00:15:33.470,00:15:35.040
"And then you'll still
get a cos^2 2u.",00:15:35.040,00:15:37.120
And it keeps on going.,00:15:37.120,00:15:38.160
"So this thing goes on
for a long time.",00:15:38.160,00:15:41.850
"But I'm not even going to finish
this, but I just want",00:15:41.850,00:15:43.870
to show you.,00:15:43.870,00:15:44.780
"The point is, we're not showing
you how to do any",00:15:44.780,00:15:47.420
complicated problem.,00:15:47.420,00:15:48.270
"We're just showing you all
the little ingredients.",00:15:48.270,00:15:50.550
"And you have to string them
together a long, long, long",00:15:50.550,00:15:53.210
"process to get to the
final answer of",00:15:53.210,00:15:56.010
one of these questions.,00:15:56.010,00:15:57.680
"So it always works,
but maybe slowly.",00:15:57.680,00:16:07.300
"By the way, there's
even another",00:16:07.300,00:16:10.270
horrible thing that happens.,00:16:10.270,00:16:13.440
"Which is, if you
handle this guy",00:16:13.440,00:16:15.970
"here, what's the technique.",00:16:15.970,00:16:22.710
"This is another technique that
you learned, supposedly within",00:16:22.710,00:16:26.040
the last few days.,00:16:26.040,00:16:28.770
Completing the square.,00:16:28.770,00:16:30.810
"So this, it turns out, you have
to rewrite it this way.",00:16:30.810,00:16:39.020
"And then the evaluation is going
to be expressed in terms",00:16:39.020,00:16:42.280
"of, I'm going to jump
to the end.",00:16:42.280,00:16:44.440
"It's going to turn out to be
expressed in terms of this.",00:16:44.440,00:16:49.310
"That's what will eventually
show up in the formula.",00:16:49.310,00:16:53.940
"And not only that, but if you
deal with ones involving x as",00:16:53.940,00:16:58.180
"well, you'll also need to deal
with something like ln of this",00:16:58.180,00:17:06.580
denominator here.,00:17:06.580,00:17:09.560
"So all of these things
will be involved.",00:17:09.560,00:17:13.120
"So now, the last message that
I have for you is just this.",00:17:13.120,00:17:16.700
"This thing is very
complicated.",00:17:16.700,00:17:18.260
"We're certainly never going
to ask you to do it.",00:17:18.260,00:17:20.150
"But you should just be aware
that this level of complexity,",00:17:20.150,00:17:23.160
"we are absolutely stuck
with in this problem.",00:17:23.160,00:17:26.690
"And the reason why we're stuck
with it is that this is what",00:17:26.690,00:17:32.150
"the formulas look
like in the end.",00:17:32.150,00:17:36.160
"If the answers look like this,
the formulas have to be this",00:17:36.160,00:17:39.740
complicated.,00:17:39.740,00:17:41.460
"If you differentiate this, you
get your polynomial, your",00:17:41.460,00:17:43.580
ratio of polynomials.,00:17:43.580,00:17:44.710
"If you differentiate this, you
get some ratio of polynomials.",00:17:44.710,00:17:46.730
"These are the things that
come up when you take",00:17:46.730,00:17:48.930
"antiderivatives of those
rational functions.",00:17:48.930,00:17:51.710
"So we're just stuck
with these guys.",00:17:51.710,00:17:56.080
"And so don't let it get
to you too much.",00:17:56.080,00:17:58.800
"I mean, it's not so bad.",00:17:58.800,00:17:59.770
"In fact, there are computer
programs that will do this for",00:17:59.770,00:18:02.260
you anytime you want.,00:18:02.260,00:18:03.510
"And you just have to be not
intimidated by them.",00:18:03.510,00:18:05.800
They're like other functions.,00:18:05.800,00:18:10.260
"OK, that's it for the general
comments on partial fractions.",00:18:10.260,00:18:20.600
Now we're going to change,00:18:20.600,00:18:21.880
subjects to our last technique.,00:18:21.880,00:18:24.410
"This is one more technical
thing to get you",00:18:24.410,00:18:25.910
familiar with functions.,00:18:25.910,00:18:27.540
"And this technique is called
integration by parts.",00:18:27.540,00:18:32.260
"Please, just because its name
sort of sounds like partial",00:18:32.260,00:18:35.550
"fractions, don't think
it's the same thing.",00:18:35.550,00:18:37.290
It's totally different.,00:18:37.290,00:18:38.450
It's not the same.,00:18:38.450,00:18:44.340
"So this one is called
integration by parts.",00:18:44.340,00:19:06.640
"Now, unlike the previous case,
where I couldn't actually",00:19:06.640,00:19:09.570
"justify to you that the linear
algebra always works.",00:19:09.570,00:19:13.010
"I claimed it worked, but I
wasn't able to prove it.",00:19:13.010,00:19:14.860
"That's a complicated theorem
which I'm not able to do in",00:19:14.860,00:19:18.440
this class.,00:19:18.440,00:19:19.560
"Here I can explain to you
what's going on with",00:19:19.560,00:19:22.520
integration by parts.,00:19:22.520,00:19:24.200
"It's just the fundamental
theorem of calculus, if you",00:19:24.200,00:19:26.840
"like, coupled with the
product formula.",00:19:26.840,00:19:30.430
"Sort of unwound and
read in reverse.",00:19:30.430,00:19:33.740
And here's how that works.,00:19:33.740,00:19:35.610
"If you take the product of
two functions and you",00:19:35.610,00:19:37.540
"differentiate them, then we
know that the product rule",00:19:37.540,00:19:40.570
says that this is u' v + uv'.,00:19:40.570,00:19:45.790
"And now I'm just going
to rearrange in",00:19:45.790,00:19:48.920
the following way.,00:19:48.920,00:19:50.400
I'm going to solve for uv'.,00:19:50.400,00:19:53.370
"That is, this term here.",00:19:53.370,00:19:54.710
So what is this term?,00:19:54.710,00:19:56.370
"It's this other term, (uv)'.",00:19:56.370,00:19:59.990
Minus the other piece.,00:19:59.990,00:20:04.520
"So I just rewrote
this equation.",00:20:04.520,00:20:08.360
"And now I'm going
to integrate it.",00:20:08.360,00:20:10.900
So here's the formula.,00:20:10.900,00:20:11.860
"The integral of the left-hand
side is equal to the integral",00:20:11.860,00:20:16.380
of the right-hand side.,00:20:16.380,00:20:17.200
"Well when I integrate a
derivative, of I get back the",00:20:17.200,00:20:19.530
function itself.,00:20:19.530,00:20:21.070
"That's the fundamental
theorem.",00:20:21.070,00:20:27.010
So this it.,00:20:27.010,00:20:27.600
"Sorry, I missed the dx,
which is important.",00:20:27.600,00:20:30.500
I apologize.,00:20:30.500,00:20:32.460
Let's put that in there.,00:20:32.460,00:20:35.410
"So this is the integration
by parts formula.",00:20:35.410,00:20:41.540
"I'm going to write it one more
time with the limits stuck in.",00:20:41.540,00:20:46.760
"It's also written this
way, when you",00:20:46.760,00:20:49.070
have a definite integral.,00:20:49.070,00:21:02.170
"Just the same formula,
written twice.",00:21:02.170,00:21:13.260
"Alright, now I'm going
to show you how it",00:21:13.260,00:21:15.260
works on a few examples.,00:21:15.260,00:21:24.360
"And I have to give you a flavor
for how it works.",00:21:24.360,00:21:29.470
"But it'll grow as we get more
and more experience.",00:21:29.470,00:21:34.230
"The first example that I'm
going to take is one that",00:21:34.230,00:21:39.640
"looks intractable on
the face of it.",00:21:39.640,00:21:43.040
"Which is the integral
of ln x dx.",00:21:43.040,00:21:49.740
"Now, it looks like there's
sort of nothing",00:21:49.740,00:21:50.950
we can do with this.,00:21:50.950,00:21:52.560
"And we don't know what
the solution is.",00:21:52.560,00:21:55.310
"However, I claim that if we fit
it into this form, we can",00:21:55.310,00:21:59.810
"figure out what the integral
is relatively easily.",00:21:59.810,00:22:03.100
"By some little magic of
cancellation it happens.",00:22:03.100,00:22:07.160
The idea is the following.,00:22:07.160,00:22:08.960
"If I consider this function to
be u, then what's going to",00:22:08.960,00:22:13.910
"appear on the other side in
the integrated form is the",00:22:13.910,00:22:17.390
"function u', which is -- so,
if you like, u = ln x.",00:22:17.390,00:22:22.680
So u' = 1 / x.,00:22:22.680,00:22:25.620
"Now, 1 / x is a more manageable
function than ln x.",00:22:25.620,00:22:28.680
"What we're using is that when we
differentiate the function,",00:22:28.680,00:22:31.370
it's getting nicer.,00:22:31.370,00:22:33.100
"It's getting more tractable
for us.",00:22:33.100,00:22:36.830
"In order for this to fit into
this pattern, however, I need",00:22:36.830,00:22:40.130
"a function v. So what in
the world am I going to",00:22:40.130,00:22:45.820
put here for v?,00:22:45.820,00:22:48.220
"The answer is, well, dx is
almost the right answer.",00:22:48.220,00:22:51.920
The answer turns out to be x.,00:22:51.920,00:22:53.860
"And the reason is that
that makes v' = 1.",00:22:53.860,00:23:01.260
It makes v' = 1.,00:23:01.260,00:23:02.630
"So that means that this is
u, but it's also uv'.",00:23:02.630,00:23:05.560
"Which was what I had on
the left-hand side.",00:23:05.560,00:23:11.240
So it's both u and uv'.,00:23:11.240,00:23:13.470
So this is the setup.,00:23:13.470,00:23:14.710
"And now all I'm going
to do is read off",00:23:14.710,00:23:16.770
what the formula says.,00:23:16.770,00:23:19.300
"What it says is, this is
equal to u v. So u is",00:23:19.300,00:23:24.380
this and v is that.,00:23:24.380,00:23:25.270
"So it's x ln x, minus, so that
again, this is uv. Except in",00:23:25.270,00:23:32.800
"the other order, vu.",00:23:32.800,00:23:37.170
"And then I'm integrating, and
what do I have to integrate? u",00:23:37.170,00:23:39.510
"' v. So look up there. u' v with
a minus sign here. u' = 1",00:23:39.510,00:23:45.550
"/ x, and v = x.",00:23:45.550,00:23:47.760
"So it's 1 / x, that's u'.",00:23:47.760,00:23:50.890
"And here is x, that's v, dx.",00:23:50.890,00:23:56.070
"Now, that one is easy
to integrate.",00:23:56.070,00:23:58.270
Because (1/x) x = 1.,00:23:58.270,00:24:00.870
"And the integral of 1 dx
is x + c, if you like.",00:24:00.870,00:24:07.630
"So the antiderivative
of 1 is x.",00:24:07.630,00:24:10.510
And so here's our answer.,00:24:10.510,00:24:11.610
"Our answer is that this
is x ln x - x + c.",00:24:11.610,00:24:34.480
"I'm going to do two
more slightly",00:24:34.480,00:24:37.400
more complicated examples.,00:24:37.400,00:24:39.380
"And then really, the main thing
is to get yourself used",00:24:39.380,00:24:43.570
to this method.,00:24:43.570,00:24:44.580
"And there's no one way
of doing that.",00:24:44.580,00:24:47.930
Just practice makes perfect.,00:24:47.930,00:24:49.970
"And so we'll just do a
few more examples.",00:24:49.970,00:24:53.070
And illustrate them.,00:24:53.070,00:24:55.870
"The second example that I'm
going to use is the integral",00:24:55.870,00:24:59.960
of (ln x) ^2 dx.,00:24:59.960,00:25:03.590
"And this is just slightly
more recalcitrant.",00:25:03.590,00:25:08.510
"Namely, I'm going to
let u be (ln x)^2.",00:25:08.510,00:25:13.270
"And again, v = to x.",00:25:17.740,00:25:20.440
So that matches up here.,00:25:20.440,00:25:21.890
"That is, v' = 1.",00:25:21.890,00:25:23.730
So this is u v'.,00:25:23.730,00:25:28.390
So this thing is u v'.,00:25:28.390,00:25:31.440
"And then we'll just
see what happens.",00:25:31.440,00:25:33.510
"Now, the game that we get is
that when I differentiate the",00:25:33.510,00:25:38.230
"logarithm squared, I'm going to
to get something simpler.",00:25:38.230,00:25:42.870
"It's not going to win us the
whole battle, but it will get",00:25:42.870,00:25:48.670
us started.,00:25:48.670,00:25:49.860
So here we get u'.,00:25:49.860,00:25:51.770
And that's 2 ln x ( 1 / x).,00:25:51.770,00:25:56.650
Applying the chain rule.,00:25:56.650,00:26:00.470
"And so the formula is that this
is x (ln x)^2, minus the",00:26:00.470,00:26:06.790
"integral of, well it's u' v,
right, that's what I have to",00:26:06.790,00:26:12.400
put over here.,00:26:12.400,00:26:13.210
"So u' = 2 ln x ( 1
/ x), and v = x.",00:26:13.210,00:26:22.190
"And so now, you notice
something interesting",00:26:22.190,00:26:25.260
happening here.,00:26:25.260,00:26:25.880
"So let me just demarcate
this a little bit.",00:26:25.880,00:26:28.960
"And let you see what it is
that I'm doing here.",00:26:28.960,00:26:34.680
"So notice, this is the
same integral.",00:26:34.680,00:26:36.820
So here we have x (ln x) ^2.,00:26:36.820,00:26:38.650
We've already solve that part.,00:26:38.650,00:26:41.050
"But now know notice that the
1 / x and the x cancel.",00:26:41.050,00:26:43.870
"So we're back to the
previous case.",00:26:43.870,00:26:46.890
"We didn't win all the way, but
actually we reduced ourselves",00:26:46.890,00:26:49.570
to this integral.,00:26:49.570,00:26:51.350
"To the integral of ln x,
which we already know.",00:26:51.350,00:26:56.630
"So here, I can copy that down.",00:26:56.630,00:26:58.700
"That's - 2 (x ln x - x), and
then I have to throw in a",00:26:58.700,00:27:04.690
"constant, c.",00:27:04.690,00:27:05.460
"And that's the end of
the problem here.",00:27:05.460,00:27:07.270
That's it.,00:27:07.270,00:27:10.260
"So this piece, I got
from Example 1.",00:27:10.260,00:27:26.400
"Now, this illustrates a
principle which is a little",00:27:26.400,00:27:35.230
"bit more complicated than
just the one of",00:27:35.230,00:27:38.490
integration by parts.,00:27:38.490,00:27:40.390
"Which is a sort of a general
principle which I'll call my",00:27:40.390,00:27:44.930
"Example 3, which is
something which is",00:27:44.930,00:27:48.270
called a reduction formula.,00:27:48.270,00:27:56.520
"A reduction formula is a case
where we apply some rule and",00:27:56.520,00:28:00.680
"we figure out one of these
integrals in terms of",00:28:00.680,00:28:03.770
something else.,00:28:03.770,00:28:05.440
Which is a little bit simpler.,00:28:05.440,00:28:07.320
"And eventually we'll get down to
the end, but it may take us",00:28:07.320,00:28:10.020
n steps from the beginning.,00:28:10.020,00:28:12.810
"So the example is
l(n x^ n) dx. .",00:28:12.810,00:28:18.040
"And the claim is that if I do
what I did in Example 2, to",00:28:18.040,00:28:21.880
"this case, I'll get a simpler
one which will",00:28:21.880,00:28:26.300
involve the n - 1st power.,00:28:26.300,00:28:28.430
"And that way I can get
all the way back down",00:28:28.430,00:28:30.790
to the final answer.,00:28:30.790,00:28:32.440
So here's what happens.,00:28:32.440,00:28:34.160
We take u as ln x^ n.,00:28:34.160,00:28:37.090
"This is the same discussion
as before, v = x.",00:28:37.090,00:28:40.980
"And then u' is n l(n
x) ^ n - 1( 1 / x).",00:28:40.980,00:28:47.440
And v' is 1.,00:28:47.440,00:28:50.020
And so the setup is similar.,00:28:50.020,00:28:52.800
"We have here x ( ln x)^
n minus the integral.",00:28:52.800,00:28:59.320
"And there's n times, it turns
out to be (ln x)^ n - 1.",00:28:59.320,00:29:05.020
"And then there's a 1 / x
and an x, which cancel.",00:29:05.020,00:29:26.410
"So I'm going to explain this
also abstractly a little bit",00:29:26.410,00:29:32.400
"just to show you what's
happening here.",00:29:32.400,00:29:35.450
"If you use the notation Fn (x)
is the integral of (ln x)^n",00:29:35.450,00:29:43.450
"dx, and we're going to forget
the constant here.",00:29:43.450,00:29:46.780
"Then the relationship that we
have here is that Fn (x) = n",00:29:46.780,00:29:52.860
"ln, I'm sorry, x (ln x)^ n.",00:29:52.860,00:29:56.590
"That's the first
term over here.",00:29:56.590,00:29:59.490
"Minus n times the
preceding one.",00:29:59.490,00:30:03.650
This one here.,00:30:03.650,00:30:07.670
"And the idea is that eventually
we can get down.",00:30:07.670,00:30:11.060
"If we start with the nth one,
we have a formula that",00:30:11.060,00:30:14.490
"includes, so the reduction is
to the n - 1st. Then we can",00:30:14.490,00:30:17.760
"reduce to the n -
2nd, and so on.",00:30:17.760,00:30:21.280
"Until we reduce to the
1, the first 1.",00:30:21.280,00:30:23.610
"And then in fact we can even
go down to the 0th one.",00:30:23.610,00:30:29.390
"So this is the idea of
a reduction formula.",00:30:29.390,00:30:32.510
"And let me illustrate it exactly
in the context of",00:30:32.510,00:30:36.480
Examples 1 and 2.,00:30:36.480,00:30:38.870
"So the first step would be to
evaluate the first one.",00:30:38.870,00:30:44.670
"Which is, if you like,
(ln x)^ 0 dx.",00:30:44.670,00:30:48.190
"That's very easy, that's x.",00:30:48.190,00:30:52.370
"And then F1 ( x) =
x ln x - F0 (x).",00:30:52.370,00:31:01.000
"Now, that's applying
this rule.",00:31:01.000,00:31:03.240
"So let me just put
it in a box here.",00:31:03.240,00:31:06.830
"This is the method
of induction.",00:31:06.830,00:31:09.380
Here's the rule.,00:31:09.380,00:31:13.510
And I'm applying it for n = 1.,00:31:13.510,00:31:21.930
I plugged in n = 1 here.,00:31:21.930,00:31:23.810
"So here, I have x ln x
^ 1 - 1 ( F0 ( x).",00:31:23.810,00:31:32.430
"And that's what I put right
here, on the right-hand side.",00:31:32.430,00:31:39.240
"And that's going to generate
for me the formula that I",00:31:39.240,00:31:41.970
"want, which is x ln x - x.",00:31:41.970,00:31:44.920
"That's the answer to this
problem over here.",00:31:44.920,00:31:49.160
This was Example 1.,00:31:49.160,00:31:51.230
"Notice I dropped the constants
because I can add",00:31:51.230,00:31:53.410
them in at the end.,00:31:53.410,00:31:54.880
"So I'll put in parentheses
here, (+ c).",00:31:54.880,00:31:57.590
"That's what would happen at
the end of the problem.",00:31:57.590,00:32:01.850
"The next step, so that was
Example 1, and now Example 2",00:32:01.850,00:32:10.320
"works more or less
the same way.",00:32:10.320,00:32:12.190
"I'm just summarizing
what I did on that",00:32:12.190,00:32:14.030
blackboard right up here.,00:32:14.030,00:32:16.640
"The same thing, but in much
more compact notation.",00:32:16.640,00:32:21.030
"If I take F2 ( x), that's going
to be equal to x (ln",00:32:21.030,00:32:26.330
x)^2 - 2 F1 ( x).,00:32:26.330,00:32:31.820
"Again, this is box for n = 2.",00:32:31.820,00:32:41.550
"And if I plug it in, what I'm
getting here is x (ln x) ^2 -",00:32:41.550,00:32:47.250
twice this stuff here.,00:32:47.250,00:32:49.570
"Which is right here.
x ln x - x.",00:32:49.570,00:32:55.780
"If you like, + c.",00:32:55.780,00:32:58.580
So I'll leave the c off.,00:32:58.580,00:33:07.360
"So this is how reduction
formulas work in general.",00:33:07.360,00:33:12.170
"I'm going to give you
one more example",00:33:12.170,00:33:14.880
of a reduction formula.,00:33:14.880,00:33:22.620
"So I guess we have to
call this Example 4.",00:33:22.620,00:33:30.560
"Let's be fancy, let's
make it the sine.",00:33:30.560,00:33:34.050
"No no, no, let's be
fancier still.",00:33:34.050,00:33:35.950
Let's make it e^ x.,00:33:35.950,00:33:38.110
"So this would also work for
cosine x and sine x.",00:33:38.110,00:33:48.790
The same sort of thing.,00:33:48.790,00:33:50.110
"And I should mention that on
your homework, you have to do",00:33:50.110,00:33:53.300
it for cosine of x.,00:33:53.300,00:33:54.400
"I decided to change my mind
on the spur of the moment.",00:33:54.400,00:33:56.550
"I'm not going to do it for
cosine because you have to",00:33:56.550,00:33:58.700
"work it out on your homework
for cosine.",00:33:58.700,00:34:00.530
"In a later homework you'll
even do this case.",00:34:00.530,00:34:03.100
So it's fine.,00:34:03.100,00:34:05.190
You need the practice.,00:34:05.190,00:34:07.400
"OK, so how am I going
to do it this time.",00:34:07.400,00:34:10.240
"This is again, a reduction
formula.",00:34:10.240,00:34:13.970
"And the trick here is to pick
u to be this function here.",00:34:13.970,00:34:19.420
"And the reason is
the following.",00:34:19.420,00:34:20.780
"So it's very important to pick
which function is the u and",00:34:20.780,00:34:23.060
"which function is the v. That's
the only decision you",00:34:23.060,00:34:26.450
"have to make if you're going to
apply integration by parts.",00:34:26.450,00:34:30.020
"When I pick this function as
the u, the advantage that I",00:34:30.020,00:34:33.160
have is that u' is simpler.,00:34:33.160,00:34:38.150
How is it simpler?,00:34:38.150,00:34:39.630
"It's simpler because it's
one degree down.",00:34:39.630,00:34:42.820
"So that's making progress
for us.",00:34:42.820,00:34:45.420
"On the other hand, this function
here is going to be",00:34:45.420,00:34:49.290
"what I'll use for v. And if I
differentiated that, if I did",00:34:49.290,00:34:54.900
"it the other way around and I
differentiated that, I would",00:34:54.900,00:34:56.780
"just get the same level
of complexity.",00:34:56.780,00:34:58.900
"Differentiating e^x just
gives you back e ^ x.",00:34:58.900,00:35:01.120
So that's boring.,00:35:01.120,00:35:02.000
"It doesn't make any progress
in this process.",00:35:02.000,00:35:05.750
"And so I'm going to instead
let v = e ^ x and,",00:35:05.750,00:35:11.090
sorry this is v '.,00:35:11.090,00:35:12.830
Make it v ' = e ^ x.,00:35:12.830,00:35:14.380
And then v = e ^x.,00:35:14.380,00:35:15.995
"At least it isn't any
worse when I went",00:35:15.995,00:35:17.800
backwards like that.,00:35:17.800,00:35:20.640
"So now, I have u and v ', and
now I get (x ^ n)( e ^ x).",00:35:20.640,00:35:28.150
"This again is u, and this is v.
So it happens that v = t v",00:35:28.150,00:35:31.730
"' so it's a little
confusing here.",00:35:31.730,00:35:34.200
"But this is the one
we're calling v '.",00:35:34.200,00:35:37.640
"And here's v. And now minus the
integral and I have here",00:35:37.640,00:35:41.510
nx ^ n - 1.,00:35:41.510,00:35:43.760
And I have here e ^ x.,00:35:43.760,00:35:45.120
"So this is u ' and
this is v dx.",00:35:45.120,00:35:52.060
"So this recurrence is
a new recurrence.",00:35:52.060,00:35:55.180
And let me summarize it here.,00:35:55.180,00:35:57.050
"It's saying that Gn ( x) should
be the integral of (x ^",00:35:57.050,00:36:01.160
n)( e ^ x) dx.,00:36:01.160,00:36:05.210
"Again, I'm dropping the c.",00:36:05.210,00:36:06.810
"And then the reduction formula
is that Gn (x) = this",00:36:06.810,00:36:17.060
"expression here, (x ^ n)(
e ^ x) - n Gn - 1 (x).",00:36:17.060,00:36:25.300
"So here's our reduction
formula.",00:36:25.300,00:36:32.830
"And to illustrate this, if I
take G0 (x), if you think",00:36:32.830,00:36:38.350
"about it for a second that's
just, there's nothing here.",00:36:38.350,00:36:40.520
"The antiderivative of e ^ x,
that's going to be e ^ x, that",00:36:40.520,00:36:44.870
"getting started at the
real basement here.",00:36:44.870,00:36:48.220
"Again, as always, 0 is
my favorite number.",00:36:48.220,00:36:52.000
Not 1.,00:36:52.000,00:36:52.820
"I always start with the easiest
one, if possible.",00:36:52.820,00:36:55.850
"And now G1, applying this
formula, is going to be equal",00:36:55.850,00:37:01.140
to x e ^ x - G0 ( x).,00:37:01.140,00:37:06.830
"Which is just right, because
n is 1 and n - 1 is 0.",00:37:06.830,00:37:11.180
"And so that's just
x e ^ x - e^ x.",00:37:11.180,00:37:17.220
"So this is a very, very
fancy way of saying",00:37:17.220,00:37:20.470
the following fact.,00:37:20.470,00:37:22.620
"I'll put it over on
this other board.",00:37:22.620,00:37:32.210
"Which is that the integral of
x e^ x dx = x e^ x - x + c.",00:37:32.210,00:37:44.600
"Yeah, question.",00:37:44.600,00:37:45.270
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:37:45.270,00:37:50.950
"PROFESSOR: The question
is, why is this true.",00:37:50.950,00:37:53.020
Why is this statement true.,00:37:53.020,00:37:54.830
Why is G 0 = e^ x.,00:37:54.830,00:37:56.420
I did that in my head.,00:37:56.420,00:37:58.410
"What I did was, I first wrote
down the formula for G0.",00:37:58.410,00:38:02.910
"Which was G0 is equal to the
integral of e^ x dx.",00:38:02.910,00:38:11.110
"Because there's an x to
the 0 power in there,",00:38:11.110,00:38:12.950
which is just 1.,00:38:12.950,00:38:15.010
"And then I know the
antiderivative of e ^ x.",00:38:15.010,00:38:17.780
It's e ^x.,00:38:17.780,00:38:23.230

"PROFESSOR: How do you know when
this method will work?",00:38:31.400,00:38:33.030
"The answer is only
by experience.",00:38:33.030,00:38:37.370
"You must get practice
doing this.",00:38:37.370,00:38:40.280
"If you look in your textbook,
you'll see hints",00:38:40.280,00:38:42.950
as to what to do.,00:38:42.950,00:38:44.430
"The other hint that I want to
say is that if you find that",00:38:44.430,00:38:47.920
"you have one factor in your
expression which when you",00:38:47.920,00:38:50.370
"differentiate it,
it gets easier.",00:38:50.370,00:38:52.590
"And when you antidifferentiate
the other half, it doesn't get",00:38:52.590,00:38:56.170
"any worse, then that's
when this method",00:38:56.170,00:38:58.470
has a chance of helping.,00:38:58.470,00:39:01.790
"And there is there's
no general thing.",00:39:01.790,00:39:04.430
"The thing is, though, if you
it with x^ n (e^ x), x ^ n",00:39:04.430,00:39:08.300
"cosine x, especially on
sine x, those are",00:39:08.300,00:39:10.700
examples where it works.,00:39:10.700,00:39:11.970
This power of the ln.,00:39:11.970,00:39:15.600
"I'll give you er one
more example here.",00:39:15.600,00:39:19.150
"So this was G1 ( x), right.",00:39:19.150,00:39:26.540
"I'll give you one more
example in a second.",00:39:26.540,00:39:28.310
Yeah.,00:39:28.310,00:39:29.330
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:29.330,00:39:33.220
PROFESSOR: Thank you.,00:39:33.220,00:39:35.680
There's a mistake here.,00:39:35.680,00:39:38.490
That's bad.,00:39:38.490,00:39:39.240
"I was thinking in the
back of my head of",00:39:39.240,00:39:39.982
the following formula.,00:39:39.982,00:39:45.910
"Which is another one which
we've just done.",00:39:45.910,00:39:51.420
"So these are the types of
formulas that you can get out",00:39:51.420,00:39:53.450
of integration by parts.,00:39:53.450,00:39:57.620
"There's also another way of
getting these, which I'm not",00:39:57.620,00:40:00.650
going to say anything about.,00:40:00.650,00:40:02.240
"Which is called advance
guessing.",00:40:02.240,00:40:04.440
"You guess in advance what the
form is, you differentiate it",00:40:04.440,00:40:06.740
and you check.,00:40:06.740,00:40:08.160
"That does work too, with
many of these cases.",00:40:08.160,00:40:14.250
"I want to give you
an illustration.",00:40:14.250,00:40:21.580
"Just because you these formulas
are somewhat dry.",00:40:21.580,00:40:30.760
"So I want to give you just
at least one application.",00:40:30.760,00:40:34.570
"We're almost done with the
idea of these formulas.",00:40:34.570,00:40:42.230
"And we're going to get back now
to being able to handle",00:40:42.230,00:40:45.600
"lots more integrals than
we could before.",00:40:45.600,00:40:47.990
"And what's satisfying is that
now we can get numbers out",00:40:47.990,00:40:50.830
"instead of being stuck and
hamstrung with only a few",00:40:50.830,00:40:54.670
techniques.,00:40:54.670,00:40:55.120
"Now we have all of the
techniques of integration that",00:40:55.120,00:40:57.820
anybody has.,00:40:57.820,00:40:59.250
"And so we can do pretty much
anything we want that's",00:40:59.250,00:41:02.880
possible to do.,00:41:02.880,00:41:04.430
"So here's, if you like, an
application that illustrates",00:41:04.430,00:41:14.990
"how integration by parts
can be helpful.",00:41:14.990,00:41:18.890
"And we're going to find the
volume of an exponential wine",00:41:18.890,00:41:27.030
glass here.,00:41:27.030,00:41:34.290
"Again, don't try this
at home, but.",00:41:34.290,00:41:38.350
So let's see.,00:41:38.350,00:41:40.500
"It's going to be this
beautiful guy here.",00:41:40.500,00:41:44.660
I think.,00:41:44.660,00:41:46.930
"OK, so what's it going to be.",00:41:46.930,00:41:49.060
"This graph is going
to be y = e^ x.",00:41:49.060,00:41:52.780
"Then we're going to rotate
it around the y axis.",00:41:52.780,00:42:04.030
"And this level here is
the height y = 1.",00:42:04.030,00:42:10.290
"And the top, let's
say, is y = e.",00:42:10.290,00:42:12.990
"So that the horizontal here,
coming down, is x = 1.",00:42:12.990,00:42:22.160
"Now, there are two ways to
set up this problem.",00:42:22.160,00:42:35.050
And so there are two methods.,00:42:35.050,00:42:40.050
"And this is also a good review
because, of course, we did",00:42:40.050,00:42:44.870
this in the last unit.,00:42:44.870,00:42:46.330
"The two methods are horizontal
and vertical slices.",00:42:46.330,00:42:58.480
"Those are the two ways
we can do this.",00:42:58.480,00:43:00.660
"Now, if we do it with, so
let's start out with the",00:43:00.660,00:43:03.840
horizontal ones.,00:43:03.840,00:43:09.370
That's this shape here.,00:43:09.370,00:43:12.370
And we're going like that.,00:43:12.370,00:43:15.370
"And the horizontal slices mean
that this little bit here is a",00:43:15.370,00:43:21.020
thickness dy.,00:43:21.020,00:43:22.890
"And then we're going to
wrap that around.",00:43:22.890,00:43:24.550
"So this is going to
become a disk.",00:43:24.550,00:43:30.810
This is the method of disks.,00:43:30.810,00:43:34.070
And what's this distance here?,00:43:34.070,00:43:35.830
"Well, this place is x.",00:43:35.830,00:43:37.770
"And so the disk has
area pi x ^2.",00:43:37.770,00:43:40.680
"And we're going to add up the
thickness of the disks and",00:43:40.680,00:43:43.400
"we're going to integrate
from 1 to e.",00:43:43.400,00:43:45.730
So here's our volume.,00:43:45.730,00:43:51.930
"And now we have one last little
item of business before",00:43:51.930,00:43:54.820
we can evaluate this integral.,00:43:54.820,00:43:56.490
"And that is that we need to know
the relationship here on",00:43:56.490,00:43:58.620
"the curve, that y = e ^ x.",00:43:58.620,00:44:01.360
So that means x = ln y.,00:44:01.360,00:44:07.490
"And in order to evaluate this
integral, we have to evaluate",00:44:07.490,00:44:10.525
"x correctly as a
function of y.",00:44:10.525,00:44:13.050
"So that's the integral
from 1 to e of (ln",00:44:13.050,00:44:16.780
"y)^2, times pi, dy.",00:44:16.780,00:44:26.200
"So now you see that this
is an integral that we",00:44:26.200,00:44:28.080
did calculate already.,00:44:28.080,00:44:30.140
"And in fact, it's sitting
right here.",00:44:30.140,00:44:34.280
"Except with the variable x
instead of the variable y.",00:44:34.280,00:44:37.030
"So the answer, which
we already had, is",00:44:37.030,00:44:41.090
this F2 ( y) here.,00:44:41.090,00:44:44.830
"So maybe I'll write
it that way.",00:44:44.830,00:44:47.820
"So this is F2 (y)
between 1 and e.",00:44:47.820,00:44:52.010
"And now let's figure
out what it is.",00:44:52.010,00:45:00.040
It's written over there.,00:45:00.040,00:45:02.060
"It's y (ln y) ^2 -
2(y ln y - y).",00:45:02.060,00:45:15.100
"The whole thing evaluated
at 1e.",00:45:15.100,00:45:24.460
"And that is, if I plug
in e here, I get e.",00:45:24.460,00:45:29.130
"Except there's a factor
of pi there, sorry.",00:45:29.130,00:45:32.150
Missed the pi factor.,00:45:32.150,00:45:36.360
So there's an e here.,00:45:36.360,00:45:38.780
"And then I subtract off, well,
at 1 this is e - e.",00:45:38.780,00:45:43.050
So it cancels.,00:45:43.050,00:45:44.330
There's nothing left.,00:45:44.330,00:45:45.440
"And then at 1, I get ln 1 is 0,
ln 1 is 0, there's only one",00:45:45.440,00:45:50.950
"term left, which is 2.",00:45:50.950,00:45:53.500
So it's - 2.,00:45:53.500,00:45:55.720
That's the answer.,00:45:55.720,00:46:03.790
"Now we get to compare that with
what happens if we do it",00:46:03.790,00:46:11.260
the other way.,00:46:11.260,00:46:15.950
So what's the vertical?,00:46:15.950,00:46:19.870
"So by vertical slicing,
we get shells.",00:46:19.870,00:46:31.830
"And that starts, that's
in the x variable.",00:46:31.830,00:46:38.530
"It starts at 0 and ends
at 1 and it's dx.",00:46:38.530,00:46:43.480
And what are the shells?,00:46:43.480,00:46:46.300
"Well, the shells are, if I can
draw the picture again, they",00:46:46.300,00:46:51.960
"start, the top value is e.",00:46:51.960,00:46:55.120
"And the bottom value
is, I need a little",00:46:55.120,00:47:01.650
bit of room for this.,00:47:01.650,00:47:02.530
The bottom value is y.,00:47:02.530,00:47:06.810
"And then we have 2 pi x is
the circumference, as we",00:47:06.810,00:47:12.950
sweep it around dx.,00:47:12.950,00:47:15.970
So here's our new volume.,00:47:15.970,00:47:18.260
"Expressed in this
different way.",00:47:18.260,00:47:23.600
"So now I'm going to plug
in what this is.",00:47:23.600,00:47:26.220
"It's the integral from
0 to 1 of e - e ^ x.",00:47:26.220,00:47:30.380
That's the formula for y.,00:47:30.380,00:47:32.570
2 pi x dx.,00:47:32.570,00:47:36.530
"And what you see is that you get
the integral from 0 to 1",00:47:36.530,00:47:41.000
of 2 pi e x dx.,00:47:41.000,00:47:45.150
"That's easy, right?",00:47:45.150,00:47:46.540
That's just 2 pi e ( 1/2).,00:47:46.540,00:47:51.940
"This one is just the
area of a triangle.",00:47:51.940,00:47:54.820
If I factor out the 2 pi e.,00:47:54.820,00:47:56.890
"And then the other piece
is the integral",00:47:56.890,00:47:58.920
of 2 pi x e^ x dx.,00:47:58.920,00:48:03.230
From 0 to 1.,00:48:03.230,00:48:08.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:48:08.610,00:48:11.550
"PROFESSOR: Are you asking me
whether I need an x ^2 here?",00:48:11.550,00:48:14.370
I just evaluated the integral.,00:48:14.370,00:48:15.960
I just did it geometrically.,00:48:15.960,00:48:17.290
"I said, this is the area
of a triangle.",00:48:17.290,00:48:19.570
"I didn't antidifferentiate and
evaluate it, I just told you",00:48:19.570,00:48:22.860
the number.,00:48:22.860,00:48:23.880
"Because it's a definite
integral.",00:48:23.880,00:48:27.580
"So now, this one here, I can
read off from right up here.",00:48:27.580,00:48:33.470
"Above it, this is G1.",00:48:33.470,00:48:37.050
"So this is equal to, let's
check it out here.",00:48:37.050,00:48:42.060
"So this is pi e, right, - 2 pi
G1 ( x), evaluated at 0 and 1.",00:48:42.060,00:48:52.280
"So let's make sure that
it's the same",00:48:52.280,00:48:53.840
as what we had before.,00:48:53.840,00:48:54.990
"It's pi e - 2 pi times
here's g1.",00:48:54.990,00:48:59.860
So it's x e ^ x - e^ x.,00:48:59.860,00:49:03.340
"So at x = 1, that cancels.",00:49:03.340,00:49:05.720
"But at the bottom
end, it's e^ 0.",00:49:05.720,00:49:08.260
So it's - 1 here.,00:49:08.260,00:49:12.040
Is that right?,00:49:12.040,00:49:13.130
Yep.,00:49:13.130,00:49:13.710
So it's pi e - 2.,00:49:13.710,00:49:17.060
It's the same.,00:49:17.060,00:49:21.710

just the distributive law.",00:49:39.710,00:49:43.730
"This is e 2 pi x, that's
this term.",00:49:43.730,00:49:46.810
"And the other terms, the
minus sign is outside.",00:49:46.810,00:49:49.550

"And the x and the e ^x stayed
inside the integral sign.",00:49:51.320,00:49:56.980
Thank you.,00:49:56.980,00:49:59.140
"The correction is that
there was a missing",00:49:59.140,00:50:01.260
"minus sign, last time.",00:50:01.260,00:50:03.780
"When I integrated from
0 to 1 x e^ x dx, I",00:50:03.780,00:50:09.710
had a x e^ x - e^x.,00:50:09.710,00:50:13.100
Evaluated at 0 and 1.,00:50:13.100,00:50:15.090
And that's equal to + 1.,00:50:15.090,00:50:18.350
I was missing this minus sign.,00:50:18.350,00:50:21.580
"The place where it came in was
in this wineglass example.",00:50:21.580,00:50:30.840
"We had the integral of
2 pi x e - e ^x dx.",00:50:30.840,00:50:39.340
"And that was 2 pi e integral of
x dx, from 0 to 1, - 2 pi,",00:50:39.340,00:50:48.900
"integral from 0 to
1 of x e^x dx.",00:50:48.900,00:50:52.810
"And then I worked this
out and it was pi e.",00:50:52.810,00:50:58.400
"And then this one was - 2 pi,
and what I wrote down was - 1.",00:50:58.400,00:51:03.030
"But there should have been an
extra minus sign there.",00:51:03.030,00:51:05.410

"The final answer was
correct, but this",00:51:08.430,00:51:11.240
