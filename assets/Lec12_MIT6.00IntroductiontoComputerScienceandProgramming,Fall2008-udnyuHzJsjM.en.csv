to the main event.",00:00:27.460,00:00:33.470
Just a few small points.,00:00:33.470,00:00:34.750
"First of all, keep in mind that
the bug is probably not",00:00:34.750,00:00:39.030
where you think it is.,00:00:39.030,00:00:40.970
"Because if a bug were there,
you'd have already found it.",00:00:40.970,00:00:45.860
"There are some simple things
that you should always look at",00:00:45.860,00:00:49.020
when you're looking for bugs.,00:00:49.020,00:00:54.940
Reversed order of arguments.,00:00:54.940,00:00:59.590
"You might have a function that
takes to floats and you just",00:00:59.590,00:01:03.850
"passed them in the
wrong order.",00:01:03.850,00:01:06.080
"You may have noticed that when
Professor Grimson and I used",00:01:06.080,00:01:09.190
"examples in class, we were
pretty careful how we name our",00:01:09.190,00:01:12.650
parameters.,00:01:12.650,00:01:14.500
"And I often end up using the
same names for the actuals and",00:01:14.500,00:01:17.720
the formals.,00:01:17.720,00:01:19.380

confused about what order to",00:01:19.380,00:01:22.740

things to look for.",00:01:30.310,00:01:32.220
"Did you spell all the
identifiers the way",00:01:32.220,00:01:34.200
you think you did.,00:01:34.200,00:01:35.970
"The problem is, when you
read code you see what",00:01:35.970,00:01:38.980
you expect to see.,00:01:38.980,00:01:41.190
"And if you've typed in l when
you should've typed a 1, or a",00:01:41.190,00:01:43.870
"1 when you should've typed an
l, you're likely to miss it.",00:01:43.870,00:01:48.320

upper and lower case.",00:01:48.320,00:01:50.990

"So just be very careful
looking at that.",00:01:52.540,00:01:57.060
Initialization.,00:01:57.060,00:02:04.500
"A very common bug is to
initialize a variable.",00:02:04.500,00:02:09.060
"Go through a loop, and then
forget to reinitialize it when",00:02:09.060,00:02:12.530
"it needs to be reinitialized
again.",00:02:12.530,00:02:15.280
"So it's initialized outside
the loop when it should be",00:02:15.280,00:02:17.890
initialized inside the loop.,00:02:17.890,00:02:20.390

variables are being",00:02:24.820,00:02:28.020
initialized.,00:02:28.020,00:02:35.330
Object versus value equality.,00:02:35.330,00:02:43.180
"Particularly when you use double
equals, are you asking",00:02:43.180,00:02:47.180
"whether you've got the same
object or the same value?",00:02:47.180,00:02:51.130
"They mean very different things,
as we have seen.",00:02:51.130,00:02:54.750
Keep track of that.,00:02:54.750,00:02:58.060
Related to that is aliasing.,00:02:58.060,00:03:05.390
"And you'll see that, by the way,
on the problem set that",00:03:05.390,00:03:08.470
we're posting tomorrow.,00:03:08.470,00:03:10.380
"Where we're going to ask you
to just look at some code,",00:03:10.380,00:03:13.410
"that there's some issues there
with the fact that you alias",00:03:13.410,00:03:17.360
"things, maybe on purpose,
maybe on accident.",00:03:17.360,00:03:20.910
"And by that I mean two different
ways to get to the",00:03:20.910,00:03:24.290
"same value, the same object.",00:03:24.290,00:03:27.240
"Frequently that introduces
bugs into the program.",00:03:27.240,00:03:33.010
"A particular instance of that
is deep versus shallow copy.",00:03:33.010,00:03:42.860
"When you decide to make a copy
of something like a list, you",00:03:42.860,00:03:46.750
"have to think hard about are you
only copying the top level",00:03:46.750,00:03:50.360
"of the list, but if it's, say,
a list that contains a list,",00:03:50.360,00:03:55.070
"are you also getting
a new copy of",00:03:55.070,00:03:56.990
everything it contains?,00:03:56.990,00:04:00.030
"It doesn't matter if it's a list
of integers or a list of",00:04:00.030,00:04:02.750
"strings or a list of tuples, but
it matters a lot if it's a",00:04:02.750,00:04:06.630
list of lists.,00:04:06.630,00:04:08.750
"Or a list of anything that
could be mutable.",00:04:08.750,00:04:11.910
"So when you copy, what
are you getting?",00:04:11.910,00:04:14.680
"When you copy a dictionary,
for example.",00:04:14.680,00:04:17.620
Think through all of that.,00:04:17.620,00:04:20.810
"And again, a related problem
that people run into is",00:04:20.810,00:04:23.780
side-effects.,00:04:23.780,00:04:29.190
"You call a function and it
returns a value, but maybe it,",00:04:29.190,00:04:33.510
"on purpose or on accident,
modifies one of the actual",00:04:33.510,00:04:37.590
parameters.,00:04:37.590,00:04:40.300
"So you could each make
a list of things.",00:04:40.300,00:04:45.680
"Every experienced programmer
over time develops a personal",00:04:45.680,00:04:51.290
"model of the mistakes
they make.",00:04:51.290,00:04:54.470
"I know the kinds of things
I get wrong.",00:04:54.470,00:04:57.650
"And so when I'm looking for a
bug, I always say, oh, have",00:04:57.650,00:05:00.075
"you done this dumb thing
you always do.",00:05:00.075,00:05:04.030
"So be a little bit
introspective.",00:05:04.030,00:05:06.790
"Keep track of the mistakes
you make.",00:05:06.790,00:05:09.970
"And if your program doesn't
work, that should be your",00:05:09.970,00:05:12.690
first guess.,00:05:12.690,00:05:15.570
Couple of other hints.,00:05:15.570,00:05:18.360
"Keep a record of what
you've tried.",00:05:18.360,00:05:30.330
"People will look at things and
they'll come in and that'll",00:05:30.330,00:05:33.800
"talk to a TA, and the TA will
say, did you try this?",00:05:33.800,00:05:37.030
"And the person will
say, I don't know.",00:05:37.030,00:05:40.500
"That leads you to end up
doing the same thing",00:05:40.500,00:05:42.620
over and over again.,00:05:42.620,00:05:44.150
"This gets back to my main theme
of Tuesday, which is be",00:05:44.150,00:05:47.440
systematic.,00:05:47.440,00:05:49.220
"Know what you've already tried,
don't waste your time",00:05:49.220,00:05:51.720
trying it again.,00:05:51.720,00:05:57.600
"Think about reconsidering
your assumptions.",00:05:57.600,00:06:08.700
"A huge one is, are you actually
running the code",00:06:08.700,00:06:13.320
"you're looking at
in your editor.",00:06:13.320,00:06:16.670
"This is a mistake I make
all the time in Python.",00:06:16.670,00:06:21.020
"I sit there in idle, and
I edit some code.",00:06:21.020,00:06:25.350
"I then click on the shell,
rather than hitting F5, try",00:06:25.350,00:06:31.140
"and run it and say, it's
not doing what I",00:06:31.140,00:06:33.710
thought I should do.,00:06:33.710,00:06:35.080
"And I'll sit there staring at
the output, staring at the",00:06:35.080,00:06:37.640
"code, not realizing that
that output was not",00:06:37.640,00:06:40.880
produced by that code.,00:06:40.880,00:06:45.160
"It's a mistake I've learned
that I make.",00:06:45.160,00:06:48.320
"It's an easy one to
make in Python.",00:06:48.320,00:06:52.550
Lots of assumptions like that.,00:06:52.550,00:06:54.760
"You thought you knew what the
built-in function sort did,",00:06:54.760,00:06:59.190
method sort did.,00:06:59.190,00:07:00.220
"Well, does it do what
you think it does?",00:07:00.220,00:07:02.610
"Does append do what
you think it does?",00:07:02.610,00:07:05.130
"Go back and say, alright,
I've obviously, some",00:07:05.130,00:07:07.340
assumption is not right.,00:07:07.340,00:07:13.220
"When you're debugging somebody
else's code, debug the code,",00:07:13.220,00:07:21.630
not the comments.,00:07:21.630,00:07:27.460
"I've often made the mistake
of believing the comments",00:07:27.460,00:07:30.200
"somebody wrote in your code
about what some function does.",00:07:30.200,00:07:34.900
"Sometimes it's good
to believe it.",00:07:34.900,00:07:36.860
"But sometimes you
have to read it.",00:07:36.860,00:07:41.850
Important thing.,00:07:41.850,00:07:43.840
"When it gets really
tough, get help.",00:07:43.840,00:07:49.540
Swallow your pride.,00:07:49.540,00:07:52.590
"Any one of my graduate students
will tell you that",00:07:52.590,00:07:55.810
"from time to time I walk into
their office and say, do you",00:07:55.810,00:07:58.470
have a minute?,00:07:58.470,00:08:00.080
"And if they foolishly say yes,
I drag them back to my office",00:08:00.080,00:08:04.960
"and say I'm stuck on this bug,
what am I doing wrong?",00:08:04.960,00:08:10.010
"And it's amazing what -- well,
a, they're smarter than I am",00:08:10.010,00:08:14.030
which helps.,00:08:14.030,00:08:15.030
"But even if they weren't smarter
than I am, just a",00:08:15.030,00:08:18.040
fresh set of eyes.,00:08:18.040,00:08:20.260
"I've read through the same thing
twenty times and I've",00:08:20.260,00:08:22.710
missed something obvious.,00:08:22.710,00:08:24.260
"Someone who's never seen it
before looks at and says, did",00:08:24.260,00:08:27.365
you really mean to do this?,00:08:27.365,00:08:31.230
"Are you sure you didn't want to
do for i in range of list,",00:08:31.230,00:08:35.890
rather than for i in list?,00:08:35.890,00:08:38.800
That sort of thing.,00:08:38.800,00:08:41.540
"Makes a big difference to just
get that set of eyes.",00:08:41.540,00:08:45.560
"And in particular, try and
explain to somebody else what",00:08:45.560,00:08:52.180
"you think the program
is doing.",00:08:52.180,00:08:54.780
"So I'll sit there with the
student and I'll say, I'm",00:08:54.780,00:08:57.850
"going to try and explain to
you why what I think this",00:08:57.850,00:09:00.630
program is doing.,00:09:00.630,00:09:02.120
"And probably 80% of the time,
halfway through my",00:09:02.120,00:09:06.760
"explanation, I say,
oh, never mind.",00:09:06.760,00:09:10.400
I'm embarrassed.,00:09:10.400,00:09:11.240
And I send them away.,00:09:11.240,00:09:12.180
"Because just the act of
explaining it to him or her",00:09:12.180,00:09:15.520
has helped me understand it.,00:09:15.520,00:09:17.920
"So when you're really stuck,
just get somebody.",00:09:17.920,00:09:21.060
"And try and explain to them why
you think your program is",00:09:21.060,00:09:24.530
doing what it's doing.,00:09:24.530,00:09:28.060
"Another good thing to do
when you're really",00:09:28.060,00:09:29.930
stuck is walk away.,00:09:29.930,00:09:36.460
Take a break.,00:09:36.460,00:09:37.230
"Come back and look at it with
fresh eyes of your own.",00:09:37.230,00:09:41.810
"Effectively, what you're doing
here is perhaps trading",00:09:41.810,00:09:45.480
latency for efficiency.,00:09:45.480,00:09:49.510
"It may, if you go back, come
back and two hours later,",00:09:49.510,00:09:54.400
"maybe you'll, it'll take you
at least two hours to have",00:09:54.400,00:09:57.380
"found the bugs, because you've
been away for two hours.",00:09:57.380,00:10:00.000
"And maybe if you'd stayed there
and worked really hard",00:10:00.000,00:10:02.390
"you'd have found it an hour
and fifty eight minutes.",00:10:02.390,00:10:05.280
"But is it really worth
the two minutes?",00:10:05.280,00:10:07.970
"This is another reason, by
the way, to start it",00:10:07.970,00:10:09.990
long before it's due.,00:10:09.990,00:10:11.710
"That you actually have the
leisure to walk away.",00:10:11.710,00:10:15.580
All right.,00:10:15.580,00:10:16.640
"What do you do when you've
found the bug and",00:10:16.640,00:10:18.570
you need to fix it?,00:10:18.570,00:10:22.480
"Remember the old saw,
haste makes waste.",00:10:22.480,00:10:30.610
"I don't know this but I'll bet
Benjamin Franklin said this.",00:10:30.610,00:10:36.200
Don't rush into anything.,00:10:36.200,00:10:38.920
"Think about the fix, don't make
the first change that",00:10:38.920,00:10:42.110
"comes to mind and
see if it works.",00:10:42.110,00:10:45.540
"Ask yourself, will it fix all
of the symptoms you've seen?",00:10:45.540,00:10:49.640
"Or if not, are the symptoms
independent, will at least fix",00:10:49.640,00:10:52.620
some of them?,00:10:52.620,00:10:54.980
"What are the ramifications
of the proposed change.",00:10:54.980,00:10:59.010
Will it break other things?,00:10:59.010,00:11:03.020
That's a big issue.,00:11:03.020,00:11:03.930
"You can fix one thing, you
break something else.",00:11:03.930,00:11:06.390
"So think through what this
change might break.",00:11:06.390,00:11:10.710
"Does it allow you to tidy
up other things?",00:11:10.710,00:11:15.060
"This is important, I
think, that code",00:11:15.060,00:11:22.890
should not always grow.,00:11:22.890,00:11:31.070
"We all have a tendency to
fix code by adding code.",00:11:31.070,00:11:36.840

harder it is to get it right.",00:11:40.810,00:11:45.070

I say, alright let me",00:11:55.900,00:11:58.680

code a little bit.",00:11:59.840,00:12:01.870

up and making it prettier,",00:12:04.220,00:12:07.480
"I'll often by accident
find the bug.",00:12:07.480,00:12:10.940

to remember.",00:12:10.940,00:12:14.160

to spend the next few lectures",00:14:13.280,00:14:17.630

known as optimization",00:14:17.630,00:14:20.620

every optimization",00:14:20.620,00:14:36.300
problem is the same.,00:14:36.300,00:14:38.300
It has two parts.,00:14:38.300,00:14:41.830
"Some function that you're either
attempting to maximize",00:14:41.830,00:14:50.840
or minimize the value of.,00:14:50.840,00:14:57.550

that must be honored.",00:15:00.630,00:15:14.370
"Possibly an empty set
of constraints.",00:15:14.370,00:15:17.600
"So what are some of the classic
optimization problems?",00:15:17.600,00:15:22.730
"Well one of the most well-known
is the so-called",00:15:22.730,00:15:26.990
shortest path problem.,00:15:26.990,00:15:33.240
"Probably almost every one
of you has used a",00:15:33.240,00:15:35.660
shortest path algorithm.,00:15:35.660,00:15:37.930
"For example, if you go to
Mapquest, or Google Maps and",00:15:37.930,00:15:41.910
"ask how do I get from
here to there.",00:15:41.910,00:15:45.520
"You give it the function,
probably in this case to",00:15:45.520,00:15:48.780
"minimize, and it gives you
a choice of functions.",00:15:48.780,00:15:51.860
"Minimize time, minimize
distance.",00:15:51.860,00:15:56.320

set of constraints.",00:15:56.320,00:15:58.450
"I don't want to drive
on highways.",00:15:58.450,00:16:01.400

shortest way, subject to those",00:16:01.400,00:16:04.630
"constraints, to get from Point
A to Point B. And there are",00:16:04.630,00:16:10.260
"many, many other instances
of this kind of thing.",00:16:10.260,00:16:13.160
"And tomorrow it's recitation,
we'll spend quite a bit of",00:16:13.160,00:16:16.690
"time on shortest
path problems.",00:16:16.690,00:16:20.650
"Another classic optimization
problem is",00:16:20.650,00:16:25.730
the traveling salesman.,00:16:25.730,00:16:27.410
"Actually, I should probably,

"traveling salesperson, the
traveling salesperson problem.",00:16:34.520,00:16:44.250
"So the problem here, roughly, is
given, a number of cities,",00:16:44.250,00:16:49.390
"and say the cost of traveling
from city to city by airplane,",00:16:49.390,00:16:53.810
"what's the least cost round
trip that you can find?",00:16:53.810,00:16:59.110

spending the least money.,00:17:11.030,00:17:12.880
"Or the least time, or
something else.",00:17:12.880,00:17:19.390
"What are some of the other
classic optimization problems?",00:17:19.390,00:17:27.490
There's bin packing.,00:17:27.490,00:17:36.270

objects of varying size and,",00:17:36.270,00:17:41.190
"perhaps, shape.",00:17:41.190,00:17:43.650

bunch of luggage.,00:17:45.820,00:17:47.230
"More luggage than can

up container ships.",00:18:01.980,00:18:04.870

is of finite size.,00:19:15.950,00:19:20.310

seen before.",00:19:51.290,00:19:54.580

ask is it an instance of some",00:19:54.580,00:20:00.160

sat down to do their program,",00:20:06.020,00:20:10.880

an algorithms book and",00:20:10.880,00:20:14.870

clever people rather than",00:20:20.200,00:20:23.130
trying to invent my own.,00:20:23.130,00:20:26.210

and do is, we take a new",00:20:26.210,00:20:29.580

problem so that we can use an",00:20:29.580,00:20:34.960
old solution.,00:20:34.960,00:20:37.690

it's nice to have in our",00:20:37.690,00:20:41.420

solved problems. To",00:20:41.420,00:20:47.005
"which we can reduce the
current problem.",00:20:47.005,00:20:50.920

semester, we'll look at,",00:20:50.920,00:20:54.000
"briefly or not so briefly,
different previously solved",00:20:54.000,00:20:57.350

some time in your future, when",00:20:57.350,00:21:01.960
"you have a problem to deal
with, you'll say, I know",00:21:01.960,00:21:05.140
"that's really like
shortest path, or",00:21:05.140,00:21:07.830
really like graph coloring.,00:21:07.830,00:21:09.970
"Let me just take my problem and
turn it into that problem,",00:21:09.970,00:21:14.000
and use an existing solution.,00:21:14.000,00:21:18.970
"So we'll start looking in detail
at one problem, and",00:21:18.970,00:21:22.970
that's the knapsack problem.,00:21:22.970,00:21:30.120
Let's see.,00:21:30.120,00:21:30.630
Where do I want to start?,00:21:30.630,00:21:31.320
"Oh yes, OK.",00:21:31.320,00:21:33.140
"So far, we've been looking
at problems that",00:21:33.140,00:21:36.590
have pretty fast solutions.,00:21:36.590,00:21:41.270
"Most optimization problems do
not have fast solutions.",00:21:41.270,00:21:46.810
"That is to say, when you're
dealing with a large set of",00:21:46.810,00:21:49.610
"things, it takes a while to
get the right answer.",00:21:49.610,00:21:54.210
"Consequently, you have to
be clever about it.",00:21:54.210,00:21:58.220
"Typically up till now, we've
looked at things that can be",00:21:58.220,00:22:00.700
done in sublinear time.,00:22:00.700,00:22:03.240
"Or, at worst, polynomial time.",00:22:03.240,00:22:09.450
"We'll now look at a problem that
does not fall into that.",00:22:09.450,00:22:12.810
"And we'll start with
what's called the",00:22:12.810,00:22:14.720
continuous knapsack problem.,00:22:14.720,00:22:22.210
"So here's the classic
formulation.",00:22:22.210,00:22:26.100
Assume that you are a burglar.,00:22:26.100,00:22:30.560
"And you have a backpack that
holds, say, eight pounds'",00:22:30.560,00:22:34.190
worth of stuff.,00:22:34.190,00:22:35.980
"And you've now broken into a
house and you're trying to",00:22:35.980,00:22:38.190
decide what to take.,00:22:38.190,00:22:41.530
"Well, let's assume in the
continuous world, what you is",00:22:41.530,00:22:44.990
"you walk into the house and you
see something like four",00:22:44.990,00:22:48.480
"pounds of gold dust. And you
see three pounds of silver",00:22:48.480,00:22:59.580
"dust, and maybe ten
pounds of raisins.",00:22:59.580,00:23:06.750
"And I don't actually
know the periodic",00:23:06.750,00:23:08.550
table entry for raisins.,00:23:08.550,00:23:11.110
So I'll have to write it out.,00:23:11.110,00:23:16.680
"Well, how would you solve
this problem?",00:23:16.680,00:23:21.730
"First, let's say, what
is the problem?",00:23:21.730,00:23:24.950
How can we formulate it?,00:23:24.950,00:23:27.930
"Well, let's assume that what
we want to do is, we have",00:23:27.930,00:23:33.070
something we want to optimize.,00:23:33.070,00:23:35.440
"So we're looking for
a function to",00:23:35.440,00:23:38.430
"maximize, in this case.",00:23:38.430,00:23:41.630
What might that function be?,00:23:41.630,00:23:44.180
"Well, let's say it's some number
of, some amount of, the",00:23:44.180,00:23:51.750
cost of the value of gold.,00:23:51.750,00:23:56.440
"Times however many
pounds of gold.",00:23:56.440,00:24:00.620
"Plus the cost of silver times
however many - no, gold, is a",00:24:00.620,00:24:08.870
"g, isn't it.",00:24:08.870,00:24:10.350
"Pounds of silver, plus the
cost of raisins times the",00:24:10.350,00:24:18.040
number of pounds of raisins.,00:24:18.040,00:24:21.270
"So that's the function
I want to optimize.",00:24:21.270,00:24:24.740
"I want to maximize
that function.",00:24:24.740,00:24:30.710
And the constraint is what?,00:24:30.710,00:24:40.120
"It's that the pounds of gold
plus the pounds of silver plus",00:24:40.120,00:24:45.320
"the pounds of raisins is
no greater than eight.",00:24:45.320,00:24:52.110
"So I've got a function to
maximize and a constraint that",00:24:52.110,00:24:54.970
must be obeyed.,00:24:54.970,00:24:58.620
"Now, the strategy here
is pretty clear.",00:24:58.620,00:25:01.700
"As often is for the continuous
problem.",00:25:01.700,00:25:04.760
What's the strategy?,00:25:04.760,00:25:06.310
"I pour in the gold till
I run out of gold.",00:25:06.310,00:25:09.710
"I pour in the silver until
I run out of silver.",00:25:09.710,00:25:12.740
"And then I take as many raisins
as will fit in and I",00:25:12.740,00:25:14.860
leave. Right?,00:25:14.860,00:25:18.600
"I hope almost every one of you
could figure out that was the",00:25:18.600,00:25:21.170
right strategy.,00:25:21.170,00:25:22.910
"If not, you're not well suited
to a life of crime.",00:25:22.910,00:25:29.400
What I just described is an,00:25:29.400,00:25:32.400
instance of a greedy algorithm.,00:25:32.400,00:25:43.930
"In a greedy algorithm, at
every step you do what",00:25:43.930,00:25:48.220
"maximizes your value
at that step.",00:25:48.220,00:25:52.570
So there's no planning ahead.,00:25:52.570,00:25:55.240
"You just do what's ever best.
It's like when someone gets",00:25:55.240,00:25:58.960
"their food and they start
by eating dessert.",00:25:58.960,00:26:01.670
"Just to make sure they
get to the best part",00:26:01.670,00:26:03.550
before they're full.,00:26:03.550,00:26:07.640
"In this case, a greedy algorithm
actually gives us",00:26:07.640,00:26:12.130
the best possible solution.,00:26:12.130,00:26:18.430
That's not always so.,00:26:18.430,00:26:21.370
"Now, you've actually all",00:26:21.370,00:26:22.580
implemented a greedy algorithm.,00:26:22.580,00:26:25.430
Or are in the process thereof.,00:26:25.430,00:26:28.630

greedy algorithm, or have been",00:26:28.630,00:26:31.800
"asked to do a greedy
algorithm?",00:26:31.800,00:26:36.010
"Well, there are not that many
things you guys have been",00:26:36.010,00:26:37.960
working on this semester.,00:26:37.960,00:26:41.260
Yeah?,00:26:41.260,00:26:41.640
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:26:41.640,00:26:48.760
PROFESSOR: Exactly right.,00:26:48.760,00:26:50.470
"So what you were doing there,
it was a really good throw.",00:26:50.470,00:27:01.540
"But it was a really good answer
you gave. So I'll",00:27:01.540,00:27:03.670
forgive you the bad hands.,00:27:03.670,00:27:09.700
"You were asked to choose
the word that gave",00:27:09.700,00:27:11.600
you the maximum value.,00:27:11.600,00:27:14.340
"And then do it again with
whatever letters you had left.",00:27:14.340,00:27:20.820
Was that guaranteed to win?,00:27:20.820,00:27:23.950
"To give you the best
possible scores?",00:27:23.950,00:27:27.120
No.,00:27:27.120,00:27:28.160
"Suppose, for example, you had
the letters this, doglets.",00:27:28.160,00:27:37.940
"Well, the highest scoring word
might have been something like",00:27:37.940,00:27:41.360
"Doges, these guys used to rule
Venice, but if you did that",00:27:41.360,00:27:50.200
"you'd been left with the letters
l and t, which are",00:27:50.200,00:27:55.440
kind of hard to use.,00:27:55.440,00:27:58.780
"So you've optimized
the first step.",00:27:58.780,00:28:00.770
"But now you're stuck
with something",00:28:00.770,00:28:02.100
that's not very useful.,00:28:02.100,00:28:04.530
"Whereas in fact, maybe you would
have been better to go",00:28:04.530,00:28:10.960
"with dog, dogs, and let.",00:28:10.960,00:28:19.820
"So what we see here is an
example of something very",00:28:19.820,00:28:24.810
important and quite general.,00:28:24.810,00:28:27.890
"Which was that locally optimal
decisions do not always lead",00:28:27.890,00:28:51.600
"to a global optimums. So you
can't just repeatedly do the",00:28:51.600,00:29:05.340
"apparently local thing
and expect to",00:29:05.340,00:29:07.970
necessarily get to it.,00:29:07.970,00:29:11.220
"Now, as it happens with the
continuous knapsack problem as",00:29:11.220,00:29:14.500
"we've formulated it,
greedy is good.",00:29:14.500,00:29:21.020
"But let's look for a slight
variant of it, where greedy is",00:29:21.020,00:29:27.710
not so good.,00:29:27.710,00:29:30.240
"And that's what's called the
zero-one knapsack problem.",00:29:30.240,00:29:56.140
"This is basically a discrete
version of",00:29:56.140,00:29:59.310
the knapsack problem.,00:29:59.310,00:30:02.420
"The formulation is that we have
n items and at every step",00:30:02.420,00:30:12.590
"we have to either take
the whole item",00:30:12.590,00:30:15.520
or none of the item.,00:30:15.520,00:30:18.060
"In the continuous problem, the
gold dust was assumed to be",00:30:18.060,00:30:21.980
infinitely small.,00:30:21.980,00:30:23.920
"And so you could take as much
of it as you wanted.",00:30:23.920,00:30:27.810
"Here it's as if you
had gold bricks.",00:30:27.810,00:30:30.750
"You get to take the whole brick
or no brick at all.",00:30:30.750,00:30:36.210
"Each item has a weight and a
value, and we're trying to",00:30:36.210,00:30:41.610
optimize it as before.,00:30:41.610,00:30:43.240
"So let's look at an example of
a zero-one knapsack problem.",00:30:43.240,00:30:47.880
"Again we'll go back
to our burglar.",00:30:47.880,00:30:51.630
"So the burglar breaks into the
house and finds the following",00:30:51.630,00:31:01.100
items available.,00:31:01.100,00:31:02.300
"And you'll see in your handout
a list of items and their",00:31:02.300,00:31:05.380
"value and how much,
what they weight.",00:31:05.380,00:31:08.250
"Finds a watch, a nice Bose
radio, a beautiful Tiffany",00:31:08.250,00:31:13.830
"vase, and a large
velvet Elvis.",00:31:13.830,00:31:19.890
"And now this burglar finds, in
fact, two of each of those.",00:31:19.890,00:31:23.510
"Person is a real velvet Elvis
fan and needed two",00:31:23.510,00:31:26.430
copies of this one.,00:31:26.430,00:31:28.940
"Alright, and now he's trying
to decide what to take.",00:31:28.940,00:31:35.130
"Well if the knapsack were large
enough the thief would",00:31:35.130,00:31:37.280
"take it all and run, but let's
assume that it can only hold",00:31:37.280,00:31:40.890
"eight pounds, as before.",00:31:40.890,00:31:43.340
"And therefore the thief
has choices to make.",00:31:43.340,00:31:46.630
"Well, there are three types of
thieves I want to consider:",00:31:46.630,00:31:49.990
"the greedy thief, the
slow thief, and you.",00:31:49.990,00:31:57.570
"We'll start with the
greedy thief.",00:31:57.570,00:32:00.420
"Well, the greedy thief follows
the greedy algorithm.",00:32:00.420,00:32:03.300
"What do you get if you follow
the greedy algorithm?",00:32:03.300,00:32:05.150
"What's the first thing
the thief does?",00:32:05.150,00:32:07.400
"Takes the most valuable item,
which is a watch.",00:32:07.400,00:32:14.720
"And then what does
he do after that?",00:32:14.720,00:32:18.110
Takes another watch.,00:32:18.110,00:32:19.570
And then?,00:32:19.570,00:32:22.540
Pardon?,00:32:22.540,00:32:22.900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:32:22.900,00:32:24.330
PROFESSOR: And then?,00:32:24.330,00:32:24.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:32:24.890,00:32:28.390
PROFESSOR: No.,00:32:28.390,00:32:29.740
"Not unless he wants to break
the vase into little pieces",00:32:29.740,00:32:32.240
and stuff it in the corners.,00:32:32.240,00:32:34.430
"The backpack is now
full, right?",00:32:34.430,00:32:38.340
There's no more room.,00:32:38.340,00:32:41.660
"So the greedy thief take
that and leaves.",00:32:41.660,00:32:45.590
"But it's not an optimal
solution.",00:32:45.590,00:32:52.420
"What should the thief
have done?",00:32:52.420,00:32:55.730
"What's the best thing
you can do?",00:32:55.730,00:32:57.860
"Instead of taking that
one vase, the thief",00:32:57.860,00:33:00.420
could take two radios.,00:33:00.420,00:33:03.890
And get more value.,00:33:03.890,00:33:06.710
"So the greedy thief, in some
sense, gets the wrong answer.",00:33:06.710,00:33:12.300
But maybe isn't so dumb.,00:33:12.300,00:33:16.020
"While greedy algorithms are not
guaranteed to get you the",00:33:16.020,00:33:19.070
"right answer all the
time, they're often",00:33:19.070,00:33:22.080
very good to use.,00:33:22.080,00:33:25.350
"And what they're good about is,
they're easy to implement.",00:33:25.350,00:33:31.190
And they're fast to run.,00:33:31.190,00:33:34.380
"You can imagine coding
the solution up",00:33:34.380,00:33:36.980
and it's pretty easy.,00:33:36.980,00:33:39.860
"And when it runs, it's pretty
fast. Just takes the most",00:33:39.860,00:33:44.890
"valuable, the next most
valuable, the next most",00:33:44.890,00:33:46.570
"valuable, I'm done.",00:33:46.570,00:33:47.390
"And the thief leaves,
and is gone.",00:33:47.390,00:33:51.000
So that's a good thing.,00:33:51.000,00:33:53.400
"On the other hand, it's often
the case in the world that",00:33:53.400,00:33:56.460
that's not good enough.,00:33:56.460,00:33:59.300
"And we're not looking for an OK
solution, but we're looking",00:33:59.300,00:34:01.990
for the best solution.,00:34:01.990,00:34:04.280
"Optimal means best. And that's
what the slow thief does.",00:34:04.280,00:34:11.440
"So the slow thief thinks
the following.",00:34:11.440,00:34:14.450
"Well, what I'll do is I'll
put stuff in the",00:34:14.450,00:34:18.070
backpack until it's full.,00:34:18.070,00:34:21.480
I'll compute its value.,00:34:21.480,00:34:24.710
"Then I'll empty the backpack
out, put another combination",00:34:24.710,00:34:28.250
"of stuff compute its value,
try all possible ways of",00:34:28.250,00:34:32.170
"filling up the backpack, and
then when I'm done, I'll know",00:34:32.170,00:34:36.370
"which was the best. And that's
the one I'll do.",00:34:36.370,00:34:40.200
"So he's packing and unpacking,
packing and unpacking, trying",00:34:40.200,00:34:43.690
"all possible combinations of
objects that will obey the",00:34:43.690,00:34:46.900
constraint.,00:34:46.900,00:34:48.950
And then choosing the winner.,00:34:48.950,00:34:51.140
"Well, this is like an algorithm
we've seen before.",00:34:51.140,00:34:53.530
It's not greedy.,00:34:53.530,00:34:54.780
What is this?,00:34:54.780,00:34:56.820
"What category of algorithm
is that?",00:34:56.820,00:34:59.820
Somebody?,00:34:59.820,00:35:01.970
Louder?,00:35:01.970,00:35:02.420
STUDENT: Brute force.,00:35:02.420,00:35:04.150
"PROFESSOR: Brute force,
exhaustive",00:35:04.150,00:35:05.530
"enumeration, exactly.",00:35:05.530,00:35:07.410
"We're exhausting all
possibilities.",00:35:07.410,00:35:09.780
And then choosing the winner.,00:35:09.780,00:35:12.490
"Well, that's what the
slow thief tried.",00:35:12.490,00:35:15.240
"Unfortunately it took so long
that before he finished the",00:35:15.240,00:35:19.240
"owner returned home, called the
police and the thief ended",00:35:19.240,00:35:21.770
up in jail.,00:35:21.770,00:35:23.860
It happens.,00:35:23.860,00:35:25.880
"Fortunately, while sitting in
jail awaiting trial, the slow",00:35:25.880,00:35:30.890
"thief decided to figure
what was wrong.",00:35:30.890,00:35:34.350
"And, amazingly enough, he
had studied mathematics.",00:35:34.350,00:35:37.650
"And had a blackboard
in the cell.",00:35:37.650,00:35:40.520
So he was able to work it out.,00:35:40.520,00:35:43.810
"So he first said, well, let me
try and figure out what I was",00:35:43.810,00:35:47.130
"really doing and why
it took so long.",00:35:47.130,00:35:50.700
"So first, let's think about what
was the function the slow",00:35:50.700,00:35:56.860
"thief was attempting
to maximize.",00:35:56.860,00:36:02.930
"The summation, from i equals 1
to n, where n is the number of",00:36:02.930,00:36:10.160
"items, so I might label watch
1-0, watch 2-2, I don't care",00:36:10.160,00:36:20.610
that they're both watches.,00:36:20.610,00:36:21.650
"They're two separate items.
And then what I want to",00:36:21.650,00:36:25.600
"maximize is the sum of the price
of item i times whether",00:36:25.600,00:36:34.360
or not I took x i.,00:36:34.360,00:36:40.400
"So think of x as a vector
of 0's and 1's.",00:36:40.400,00:36:51.090
Hence the name of the problem.,00:36:51.090,00:36:54.130
"If I'm going to keep that item,
item i, if I'm going to",00:36:54.130,00:36:57.500
"take it, I give it a 1.",00:36:57.500,00:36:59.740
"If I'm not going to take
it I give it a 0.",00:36:59.740,00:37:03.800
"And so I just take the value of
that item times whether or",00:37:03.800,00:37:07.140
not it's 0 or 1.,00:37:07.140,00:37:11.000
"So my goal here is to choose x
such that this is maximized.",00:37:11.000,00:37:19.840
"Choose x such that that function
is maximized, subject",00:37:19.840,00:37:25.240
to a constraint.,00:37:25.240,00:37:28.660
"And the constraint, is it the
sum from 1 to n of the weight",00:37:28.660,00:37:48.020
"of the item, times x i, is less
than or equal to c, the",00:37:48.020,00:37:57.950
"maximum weight I'm allowed
to put in my backpack.",00:37:57.950,00:38:00.760
In this case it was eight.,00:38:00.760,00:38:04.810
"So now I have a nice, tidy
mathematical formulation of",00:38:04.810,00:38:08.600
the problem.,00:38:08.600,00:38:10.380
"And that's often the first step
in problem reduction.",00:38:10.380,00:38:14.490
"Is to go from a problem that has
a bunch of words, and try",00:38:14.490,00:38:18.560
"and write it down as a nice,
tight mathematical",00:38:18.560,00:38:21.450
formulation.,00:38:21.450,00:38:23.100
"So now I know the formulation
is to find x, the vector x,",00:38:23.100,00:38:28.190
"such that this constraint
is obeyed and",00:38:28.190,00:38:31.410
this function is maximized.,00:38:31.410,00:38:37.610
That make sense to everybody?,00:38:37.610,00:38:38.680
Any questions about that?,00:38:38.680,00:38:42.730
Great.,00:38:42.730,00:38:45.720
"So as the thief had thought,
we can clearly solve this",00:38:45.720,00:38:50.220
"problem by generating all
possible values of x and",00:38:50.220,00:38:57.270
"seeing which one solves
this problem.",00:38:57.270,00:39:03.990
"But now the thief started
scratching his head and said,",00:39:03.990,00:39:06.720
"well, how many possible
values of x are there?",00:39:06.720,00:39:13.450
"Well, how can we think
about that?",00:39:13.450,00:39:19.670
"Well, a nice way to think
about that is to",00:39:19.670,00:39:23.450
"say, I've got a vector.",00:39:23.450,00:39:25.990
"So there's the vector with
eight 0's in it.",00:39:25.990,00:39:32.460
"Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.",00:39:32.460,00:39:36.140
"Indicating I didn't take
any of the items.",00:39:36.140,00:39:44.120
"There's the vector, and again
you'll see this in your",00:39:44.120,00:39:48.610
"handout, says I only took
the first item.",00:39:48.610,00:39:55.610
"There's the one that says I
only took the second item.",00:39:55.610,00:40:00.330
"There's the one that says
I took the first",00:40:00.330,00:40:02.590
and the second item.,00:40:02.590,00:40:05.330
"And at the last,
I have all 1's.",00:40:05.330,00:40:09.140

PROFESSOR: Right.,00:40:55.020,00:40:58.390
Yes.,00:40:58.390,00:40:58.760
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:40:58.760,00:41:01.140
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:41:01.140,00:41:01.930
Exactly right.,00:41:01.930,00:41:03.400
"So, in this case it's
2 to the 8th.",00:41:03.400,00:41:07.060
Because I have eight digits.,00:41:07.060,00:41:08.890
But exactly right.,00:41:08.890,00:41:11.270
"More generally, it's
2 to the n.",00:41:11.270,00:41:18.670
"Where n is the number of
possible items I have to",00:41:18.670,00:41:21.910
choose from.,00:41:21.910,00:41:26.460
"Well, now that we've figured
that out, what we're seeing is",00:41:26.460,00:41:33.550
"that the brute force algorithm
is exponential.",00:41:33.550,00:41:42.600
"In the number of items we
have to choose from.",00:41:42.600,00:41:46.640
"Not in the number that we take,
but the number we have",00:41:46.640,00:41:49.380
to think about taking.,00:41:49.380,00:41:52.330
"Exponential growth
is a scary thing.",00:41:52.330,00:41:57.120
"So now we can look at
these two graphs,",00:41:57.120,00:42:01.390
look at the top one.,00:42:01.390,00:42:03.490
"So there, we've compared n
squared, quadratic growth,",00:42:03.490,00:42:10.630
"which by the way Professor
Grimson told you was bad, to,",00:42:10.630,00:42:15.650
"really bad, which is
exponential growth.",00:42:15.650,00:42:19.180
"And in fact, if you look at
the top figure it looks as",00:42:19.180,00:42:22.870
"exponential or, quadratic isn't
even growing at all.",00:42:22.870,00:42:27.570
"You see how really fast
exponential growth is?",00:42:27.570,00:42:31.090
"You get to fifteen items and
we're up at seventy thousand",00:42:31.090,00:42:34.660
already and counting.,00:42:34.660,00:42:39.150
"The bottom graph has exactly
the same data.",00:42:39.150,00:42:42.840
"But what I've done is, I've use
the logarithmic y-axis.",00:42:42.840,00:42:47.040
"Later in the term, we'll spend
quite a lot of time talking",00:42:47.040,00:42:49.930
"about how do we visualize
data.",00:42:49.930,00:42:52.130
How do we make sense of data.,00:42:52.130,00:42:54.220
"I've done that because you can
see here that the quadratic",00:42:54.220,00:42:57.270
one is actually growing.,00:42:57.270,00:42:59.890
"It's just growing a
lot more slowly.",00:42:59.890,00:43:05.400
"So the moral here
is simple one.",00:43:05.400,00:43:08.700
"Exponential algorithms are
typically not useful. n does",00:43:08.700,00:43:15.910
"not have to get very big for
exponential to fail.",00:43:15.910,00:43:21.470
"Now, imagine that you're trying
to pack a ship and",00:43:21.470,00:43:24.150
"you've got ten thousand
items to choose from.",00:43:24.150,00:43:27.780
"2 to the 10,000 is a
really big number.",00:43:27.780,00:43:34.790
"So what we see immediately,
and the slow thief decided",00:43:34.790,00:43:39.190
"just before being incarcerated
for years and years, was that",00:43:39.190,00:43:44.500
"it wasn't possible to
do it that way.",00:43:44.500,00:43:47.090
"He threw up his hands and
said, it's an unsolvable",00:43:47.090,00:43:51.210
"problem, I should have been
greedy, there's no",00:43:51.210,00:43:52.860
good way to do this.,00:43:52.860,00:43:55.320
"That gets us to the
smart thief.",00:43:55.320,00:43:58.320
Why is this thief smart?,00:43:58.320,00:43:59.780
Because she took 600.,00:43:59.780,00:44:02.100
"And she learned that in fact
there is a good way to solve",00:44:02.100,00:44:04.640
this problem.,00:44:04.640,00:44:06.200
"And that's what we're going
to talk about next.",00:44:06.200,00:44:10.660
"And that's something called
dynamic programming.",00:44:10.660,00:44:23.060
"A lot of people think this is
a really hard and fancy",00:44:23.060,00:44:26.150
"concept, and they teach in
advanced algorithms classes.",00:44:26.150,00:44:29.770
"And they do, but in fact
as you'll see it's",00:44:29.770,00:44:31.810
really pretty simple.,00:44:31.810,00:44:33.730
A word of warning.,00:44:33.730,00:44:35.810
"Don't try and figure out
why it's called dynamic",00:44:35.810,00:44:38.290
programming.,00:44:38.290,00:44:39.380
It makes no sense at all.,00:44:39.380,00:44:41.800
"It was invented by a
mathematician called Bellman.",00:44:41.800,00:44:45.880
"And he was at the time being
paid by the Defense Department",00:44:45.880,00:44:49.370
to work on something else.,00:44:49.370,00:44:51.830
"And he didn't want them to
know what he was doing.",00:44:51.830,00:44:54.090
"So he made up a name that he
was sure they would have no",00:44:54.090,00:44:56.250
clue what it meant.,00:44:56.250,00:44:58.820
"Unfortunately, we now have
lived with it forever, so",00:44:58.820,00:45:02.240
"don't think of it as actually
being anything dynamic",00:45:02.240,00:45:04.660
particularly.,00:45:04.660,00:45:05.850
It's just a name.,00:45:05.850,00:45:09.870
"It's very useful, and why we
spend time on it for solving a",00:45:09.870,00:45:13.330
"broad range of problems that
on their surface are",00:45:13.330,00:45:18.260
exponentially difficult.,00:45:18.260,00:45:20.870
"And, in fact, getting very
fast solutions to them.",00:45:20.870,00:45:25.530
"The key thing in dynamic
programming, and we'll return",00:45:25.530,00:45:28.300
"to both of these, is you're
looking for a situation where",00:45:28.300,00:45:32.100
"there are overlapping
sub-problems and what's called",00:45:32.100,00:45:45.280
optimal substructure.,00:45:45.280,00:45:47.590
"Don't expect to know what
these mean yet.",00:45:47.590,00:45:49.620
"Hopefully by the end of the day,
Tuesday, they will both",00:45:49.620,00:45:52.750
make great sense to you.,00:45:52.750,00:45:55.220
"Let's first look at
the overlapping",00:45:55.220,00:45:56.920
sub-problems example.,00:45:56.920,00:45:59.760
"You have on your handout,
a recursive",00:45:59.760,00:46:05.120
implementation of Fibonacci.,00:46:05.120,00:46:07.640
Which we've seen before.,00:46:07.640,00:46:25.830
"What I've done is I've augmented
it with this global",00:46:25.830,00:46:28.840
"called num calls just so I can
keep track of how many times",00:46:28.840,00:46:32.560
it gets called.,00:46:32.560,00:46:34.920
"And let's see what happens
if we call fib of 5.",00:46:34.920,00:46:48.930
"Well, quite a few steps.",00:46:48.930,00:46:53.650
"What's the thing that you notice
about this output?",00:46:53.650,00:47:00.710
"There's something here that
should tip us off that maybe",00:47:00.710,00:47:03.770
"we're not doing this the most
efficient way possible.",00:47:03.770,00:47:09.080
"I called fib with 5 and then
it calls it with 4.",00:47:09.080,00:47:15.040
"And then that call
calls fib with 3.",00:47:15.040,00:47:17.870
"So I'm doing 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0.",00:47:17.870,00:47:21.420
"And I'm doing 1, 2.",00:47:21.420,00:47:22.800
"Well, what we see is I'm calling
fib a lot of times",00:47:22.800,00:47:26.180
with the same argument.,00:47:26.180,00:47:30.760
And it makes sense.,00:47:30.760,00:47:31.800
"Because I start with fib of 5,
and then I have to do fib of 4",00:47:31.800,00:47:36.200
and fib of 3.,00:47:36.200,00:47:39.510
"Well, fib of 4 is going to also
have to do a fib of 3 and",00:47:39.510,00:47:42.940
"a fib of 2 and a fib of
1, and a fib of 0.",00:47:42.940,00:47:46.210
"And then the fib of 3 is going
to do a fib of 2 and a fib of",00:47:46.210,00:47:49.220
1 and a fib of 0.,00:47:49.220,00:47:51.150
"And so I'm doing the same thing
over and over again.",00:47:51.150,00:47:56.120
"That's because I have what
are called overlapping",00:47:56.120,00:47:59.420
"sub-problems. I have used divide
and conquer, as we seen",00:47:59.420,00:48:04.630
"before, to recursively break it
into smaller problems. But",00:48:04.630,00:48:08.670
"the smaller problem of fib of
4 and the smaller problem of",00:48:08.670,00:48:12.850
"fib of 3 overlap with
each other.",00:48:12.850,00:48:16.740
"And that leads to a lot of
redundant computation.",00:48:16.740,00:48:21.210
"And I've done fib of 5, which
is a small number.",00:48:21.210,00:48:24.680
"If we look at some other things,
for example, let's get",00:48:24.680,00:48:29.120
rid of this.,00:48:29.120,00:48:39.860
Let's try see fib of 10.,00:48:39.860,00:48:56.590
"Well, there's a reason I chose
10 rather than, say, 20.",00:48:56.590,00:49:02.590
Here fib got called 177 times.,00:49:02.590,00:49:09.420
"Roughly speaking, the analysis
of fib is actually quite",00:49:09.420,00:49:13.280
"complex, of a recursive fib.",00:49:13.280,00:49:15.020
"And I won't go through it, but
what you can see is it's more",00:49:15.020,00:49:18.290
"or less, it is in fact,
exponential.",00:49:18.290,00:49:21.680
"But it's not 2 to
the something.",00:49:21.680,00:49:23.840
It's a more complicated thing.,00:49:23.840,00:49:26.950
But it grows quite quickly.,00:49:26.950,00:49:29.370
"And the reason it does is
because of this overlapping.",00:49:29.370,00:49:34.240
"On Tuesday we'll talk about a
different way to implement",00:49:34.240,00:49:38.750
"Fibonacci, where the growth will
be much less dramatic.",00:49:38.750,00:49:44.510
Thank you.,00:49:44.510,00:49:46.030
