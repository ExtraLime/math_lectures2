thought this was a SHASS",00:00:31.610,00:00:33.780

philosophy class, and it was",00:00:33.780,00:00:35.860
"important to set the stage for
what we're going to talk",00:00:35.860,00:00:38.620
"about, but we talked about
very high level things.",00:00:38.620,00:00:41.180

notion of computation, why you",00:00:41.180,00:00:43.960

"bolts of the basics of
computation, and in",00:00:48.000,00:00:51.040
"particular, what I'm going to do
today is, I'm going to talk",00:00:51.040,00:00:53.320
"about operators and operands,
which we did a little bit real",00:00:53.320,00:00:56.160
"last time, in particular how
to create expressions, I'm",00:00:56.160,00:00:58.960
"going to talk about statements
as the key building blocks for",00:00:58.960,00:01:02.360

introduce simple sets of",00:01:02.360,00:01:06.060

going to talk about branching,",00:01:06.060,00:01:09.180
"conditionals, and iteration.",00:01:09.180,00:01:11.290
"So, a lot to do.",00:01:11.290,00:01:12.530
OK?,00:01:12.530,00:01:13.530
"So, let me jump straight
to it.",00:01:13.530,00:01:16.070
"At the end of last lecture, we
started introducing some of",00:01:16.070,00:01:18.350
the pieces you want to do.,00:01:18.350,00:01:19.120
"And I want to remind
you of our goal.",00:01:19.120,00:01:20.450
"We're trying to describe
processes.",00:01:20.450,00:01:22.980
"We want to have things that
deduce new kinds of",00:01:22.980,00:01:24.700
information.,00:01:24.700,00:01:25.770
"So we want to write programs
to do that.",00:01:25.770,00:01:28.120
"If we're going to write
programs, we need at least two",00:01:28.120,00:01:30.020
"things: we need some
representation",00:01:30.020,00:01:32.570
for fundamental data.,00:01:32.570,00:01:34.420
"And we saw last time two
examples of that.",00:01:34.420,00:01:37.080
"And the second thing we're going
to need, is we're going",00:01:37.080,00:01:39.000
"to need a way to give
instructions to the computer",00:01:39.000,00:01:43.230
to manipulate that data.,00:01:43.230,00:01:44.390
"We need to give it a description
of the recipe.",00:01:44.390,00:01:47.570
"In terms of primitive
data, what we saw",00:01:47.570,00:01:52.940
were two kinds: Right?,00:01:52.940,00:01:56.910
Numbers and strings.,00:01:56.910,00:02:00.570
"A little later on in the
lecture we're going to",00:02:00.570,00:02:04.940
"introduce a third kind of value,
but what we're going to",00:02:04.940,00:02:08.060
"see throughout the term is, no
matter how complex a data",00:02:08.060,00:02:11.260
"structure we create, and we're
going to create a variety of",00:02:11.260,00:02:13.270
"data structures, fundamentally
all of them have their basis,",00:02:13.270,00:02:16.790
"their atomic level if you like,
are going to be some",00:02:16.790,00:02:19.130
"combinations of numbers, of
strings, and the third type,",00:02:19.130,00:02:22.290
"which are booleans, which I'm
going to introduce a little",00:02:22.290,00:02:23.700
later on in this lecture.,00:02:23.700,00:02:25.670
"And that kind of makes
sense right?",00:02:25.670,00:02:27.030
"Numbers are there to do numeric
things, strings are",00:02:27.030,00:02:29.210
"our fundamental way of
representing textual",00:02:29.210,00:02:31.070
information.,00:02:31.070,00:02:31.810
"And so we're going to see
how to combine those",00:02:31.810,00:02:33.105
things as we go along.,00:02:33.105,00:02:35.810
"Second thing we saw was, we saw
that associated with every",00:02:35.810,00:02:38.800
primitive value was a type.,00:02:38.800,00:02:41.480
"And these are kind of
obvious, right?",00:02:41.480,00:02:42.880
Strings are strings.,00:02:42.880,00:02:44.880
"For numbers, we had some
variations; we had integers,",00:02:44.880,00:02:47.510
we had floats.,00:02:47.510,00:02:48.300
"We'll introduce a few
more as we go along.",00:02:48.300,00:02:49.910
"But those types are important,
because they tell us something",00:02:49.910,00:02:52.140
"about what we want to do when we
want to put them together.",00:02:52.140,00:02:55.560
"OK, but nonetheless, I want to
stress we have both a value,",00:02:55.560,00:03:00.730
"yeah, and a type.",00:03:00.730,00:03:05.630
All right.,00:03:05.630,00:03:05.820
"Once we have them, we
want to start making",00:03:05.820,00:03:07.210
combinations out of them.,00:03:07.210,00:03:08.120
"We want to put pieces
together.",00:03:08.120,00:03:10.330
"And for that, we combine
things in expressions.",00:03:10.330,00:03:19.630
"And what we saw as expressions
are formed of",00:03:19.630,00:03:21.920
operands and operators.,00:03:21.920,00:03:30.720
"And the simple things we did
were the sort of things you'd",00:03:30.720,00:03:34.320
expect from numerical things.,00:03:34.320,00:03:36.640
"Now I want to stress one
other nuance here.",00:03:36.640,00:03:39.300
"Which is, and we're going to
do some examples of this,",00:03:39.300,00:03:41.020
"initially we just typed in
expressions into the",00:03:41.020,00:03:43.590
"interpreter; that is, directly
into Python.",00:03:43.590,00:03:46.560
"And as I suggested last time,
the interpreter is actually a",00:03:46.560,00:03:48.740
"program inside of the machine
that is basically following",00:03:48.740,00:03:52.000
"the rules we're describing here
to deduce the value and",00:03:52.000,00:03:54.346
print it up.,00:03:54.346,00:03:55.350
"And if we type directly into
the interpreter, it",00:03:55.350,00:03:58.040
"essentially does an
eval and a print.",00:03:58.040,00:03:59.670
"It evaluates, and it prints.",00:03:59.670,00:04:07.960
"Most of the time, we're going to
be doing expressions inside",00:04:07.960,00:04:10.730
"of some piece of code, inside
of a script, which is the",00:04:10.730,00:04:13.030
Python word for program.,00:04:13.030,00:04:15.150
"In there, I want to make this
distinction, this nuance: the",00:04:15.150,00:04:17.700
"evaluator is still going to be
taking those expressions and",00:04:17.700,00:04:20.310
"using its rules to get a value,
but it's not going to",00:04:20.310,00:04:23.040
print them back out.,00:04:23.040,00:04:24.960
Why?,00:04:24.960,00:04:25.420
"Because typically, you're doing
that to use it somewhere",00:04:25.420,00:04:27.880
else in the program.,00:04:27.880,00:04:28.780
"It's going to be stored
away in a variable.",00:04:28.780,00:04:30.500
"It's going to be stuck
in a data structure.",00:04:30.500,00:04:31.870
"It's going to be used
for a side effect.",00:04:31.870,00:04:34.360
"So, inside of code, or inside of
a script, there's no print,",00:04:34.360,00:04:40.990
unless we make it explicit.,00:04:40.990,00:04:45.310
"And that's a little bit down in
the weeds, it's a detail,",00:04:45.310,00:04:47.800
but one I want to stress.,00:04:47.800,00:04:48.780
"You need to, if you want
something to be printed out",00:04:48.780,00:04:50.550
"inside your code, you need to
tell the machine to do that.",00:04:50.550,00:04:54.450
OK.,00:04:54.450,00:04:56.010
"So let's do some simple
examples.",00:04:56.010,00:04:57.460
We've already seen somebody's.,00:04:57.460,00:04:58.470
"I just want to remind you, if I
wanted to, for example, type",00:04:58.470,00:05:02.380
"in an expression like that,
notice the syntactical form,",00:05:02.380,00:05:04.940
"it's an expression, a number,
followed by an operand,",00:05:04.940,00:05:07.940
"followed by another
expression.",00:05:07.940,00:05:09.830
"And of course I get out the
value I'd like there.",00:05:09.830,00:05:12.840
Yes sir.,00:05:12.840,00:05:15.810
"Oh, you don't like leaning
that far to the left?",00:05:15.810,00:05:17.650
"OK, if you're a Republican I'll
be happy to shift this",00:05:17.650,00:05:20.230
over a little bit.,00:05:20.230,00:05:22.030
"Wow, John, I got a laugh
for a political",00:05:22.030,00:05:23.700
"joke, I'm in big trouble.",00:05:23.700,00:05:24.500
That better?,00:05:24.500,00:05:26.580
"Oh damn, all right, I'll have
to do it even more.",00:05:26.580,00:05:32.740
"OK, here we go, here we go,
you see, I'm doing it down",00:05:32.740,00:05:35.040
"here, I can't see it, does
that-- ah, I hear his sighs of",00:05:35.040,00:05:37.420
"relief, OK, good.",00:05:37.420,00:05:38.570
There we go.,00:05:38.570,00:05:39.730
Better.,00:05:39.730,00:05:40.140
All right.,00:05:40.140,00:05:41.290
"One of the other things we
showed last time is that",00:05:41.290,00:05:42.900
operators are overloaded.,00:05:42.900,00:05:44.410
"And this is where you heard
John and I disagree.",00:05:44.410,00:05:46.050
"I don't happen to like
this, but he",00:05:46.050,00:05:47.720
thinks it's an ok thing.,00:05:47.720,00:05:49.100
"In a particular-- if we, whoa,
we don't do that, we do this--",00:05:49.100,00:05:54.180
"that is, give a combination of
a number multiplication in a",00:05:54.180,00:05:57.330
"string, this will in fact give
us back a new string with that",00:05:57.330,00:06:01.460
"many replicas, if you
like, of the string",00:06:01.460,00:06:03.280
concatenated together.,00:06:03.280,00:06:05.520
All right?,00:06:05.520,00:06:05.790
"And if you want to do other
things, for example, we can",00:06:05.790,00:06:08.110
"take two strings and add--
whoops, sorry-- and add them",00:06:08.110,00:06:10.960
"together, we will get
out, again, a",00:06:10.960,00:06:15.470
concatenation of that string.,00:06:15.470,00:06:17.270
"And these will, we'll let you
work through the variations,",00:06:17.270,00:06:19.040
"but these are the simple
expressions we can use.",00:06:19.040,00:06:21.690
"Now, sometimes things get
a little interesting.",00:06:21.690,00:06:25.440
All right?,00:06:25.440,00:06:27.860
"What's the value of
that expression?",00:06:27.860,00:06:33.250
"What do you think should happen
if I evaluate that",00:06:33.250,00:06:35.360
expression?,00:06:35.360,00:06:38.350
"Somebody with a hand up,
so I can see it.",00:06:38.350,00:06:38.470
What's going to happen?,00:06:38.470,00:06:39.120
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE],00:06:39.120,00:06:41.390
"PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON:
An error?",00:06:41.390,00:06:43.350
Why?,00:06:43.350,00:06:43.830
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE],00:06:43.830,00:06:48.210
PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON: Great.,00:06:48.210,00:06:50.538
OK.,00:06:50.538,00:06:50.686
"That means, let's check it.",00:06:50.686,00:06:51.021
It certainly is.,00:06:51.021,00:06:52.550
We bribe people.,00:06:52.550,00:06:53.670
"So I, ah, by the way, John's a
Yankees fan, he throws like",00:06:53.670,00:06:57.540
"Johnny Damon, I'm a Red Sox fan,
so we'll see if I, how",00:06:57.540,00:07:00.430
about that?,00:07:00.430,00:07:00.770
"And I almost hit John along
the way, great.",00:07:00.770,00:07:03.530
"My third right, exactly,
what can I say?",00:07:03.530,00:07:05.350
"All right, so we're into bribing
you as we go along",00:07:05.350,00:07:07.620
"here, and all right?",00:07:07.620,00:07:08.730
"You'll be badly overweight
by the end of the term.",00:07:08.730,00:07:11.340
"Right, it's a syntactic error,
because it doesn't know how to",00:07:11.340,00:07:13.670
deal with this.,00:07:13.670,00:07:14.390
"But there's an important thing
going on here, if I in fact",00:07:14.390,00:07:16.500
"wanted to combine those into a
string, I should have told the",00:07:16.500,00:07:19.610
"machine to do that, and I can do
that, by explicitly saying,",00:07:19.610,00:07:23.690
"take that, which is a number,
and convert it into a string,",00:07:23.690,00:07:27.700
"and then-- bleah, I keep
doing that-- then",00:07:27.700,00:07:29.680
add it to that string.,00:07:29.680,00:07:33.650
"OK, so there's an important
point here.",00:07:33.650,00:07:35.960
"We've got what's called
type conversion.",00:07:35.960,00:07:44.810
"That is, if I want to combine
two things together in a",00:07:44.810,00:07:48.800
"particular way, I need to make
sure that I give it the kind",00:07:48.800,00:07:52.200
of operand it expects.,00:07:52.200,00:07:53.740
"So STR, which I just typed up
there, takes in parens, some",00:07:53.740,00:07:57.800
"input, and it converts it into
a string, so that now I can",00:07:57.800,00:08:01.040
"use that where I was
expecting a string.",00:08:01.040,00:08:02.970

"PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: You've
got a static semantic error in",00:08:03.350,00:08:07.656
your syntax.,00:08:07.656,00:08:07.710
"PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON:
Thank you.",00:08:07.710,00:08:08.694

in a second, but thank",00:08:08.694,00:08:10.220
"you, John, for pointing it out.",00:08:10.220,00:08:11.260
All right.,00:08:11.260,00:08:12.550
"Why is it a static
semantic error?",00:08:12.550,00:08:15.120
"The syntax is OK in the sense
of, it is an operand, an",00:08:15.120,00:08:18.670
"operator, an operand, so
syntactically it's OK.",00:08:18.670,00:08:23.380
"The semantics was what caused
the problem, because the",00:08:23.380,00:08:26.000

a particular kind",00:08:26.000,00:08:28.670

on here that I want to",00:08:30.380,00:08:32.020

really important.",00:08:32.020,00:08:36.480

highlight is, that what's",00:08:38.970,00:08:41.450
"going on, is that Python is
doing some type checking.",00:08:41.450,00:08:48.130
"It caught the error, because
it checked the types of the",00:08:48.130,00:08:51.580
"operands before it applied
things, and it says,",00:08:51.580,00:08:54.050
I'm going to stop.,00:08:54.050,00:08:55.640
"Now, you might have said, gee,
why didn't it just assume that",00:08:55.640,00:08:57.860
"I wanted to in fact treat these
as strings, and combine",00:08:57.860,00:09:00.030
them together?,00:09:00.030,00:09:01.130
"Sounds like a reasonable
thing to do.",00:09:01.130,00:09:03.540
But it's a dangerous thing.,00:09:03.540,00:09:05.300
"Because in doing that, Python
would then have a value that",00:09:05.300,00:09:08.230
"it could pass on into some other
part of a computation,",00:09:08.230,00:09:10.280
"and if it wasn't what I wanted,
I might be a long ways",00:09:10.280,00:09:13.820
"downstream in the computation
before I actually hit some",00:09:13.820,00:09:16.910
result that makes no sense.,00:09:16.910,00:09:18.960
"And tracing back where it came
from can be really hard.",00:09:18.960,00:09:21.330
"So I actually want to have
type checking as much",00:09:21.330,00:09:23.810
as I can early on.,00:09:23.810,00:09:26.340
"And in fact, under type
checking, different languages",00:09:26.340,00:09:28.380
"sometimes fall on a spectrum
from weak to strong typing.",00:09:28.380,00:09:36.740
"Which basically says, how much
type checking do they do?",00:09:36.740,00:09:39.830
"Now, you're going to hear John
and I go back and forth a lot,",00:09:39.830,00:09:42.370
"as I said I'm an old time-- well
I'm certainly old time,",00:09:42.370,00:09:44.470
"but I'm also an old time
Lisp programmer.",00:09:44.470,00:09:46.770
"I love Lisp, but Lisp is
certainly in the category of a",00:09:46.770,00:09:49.320
very weakly typed language.,00:09:49.320,00:09:50.680
"It does not check the types
of its arguments at all.",00:09:50.680,00:09:53.830
"Python is, I wouldn't say
completely strong, but it's",00:09:53.830,00:09:55.960
"much closer to the strong
end of the spectrum.",00:09:55.960,00:09:58.060
"It's going to do a lot of type
checking for you before it",00:09:58.060,00:10:00.900
actually passes things back.,00:10:00.900,00:10:03.400
"Nonetheless, I'm also going to
argue that it's probably not",00:10:03.400,00:10:06.080
"as strongly typed as
we might like.",00:10:06.080,00:10:08.570
"So, for example, there's
an expression.",00:10:08.570,00:10:13.440
"Now, less than is just, if you
haven't used it before, it's",00:10:13.440,00:10:15.455
"just the operator you'd expect,
it's comparing two",00:10:15.455,00:10:17.380
"things and it's going to return
either true or false",00:10:17.380,00:10:19.200
"depending on whether the first
argument is less than the",00:10:19.200,00:10:21.210
second argument.,00:10:21.210,00:10:23.270
What's going to happen here?,00:10:23.270,00:10:24.690

"PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON:
Good question.",00:10:39.260,00:10:40.020
"Sounds like a reasonable
guess, right?",00:10:40.020,00:10:41.000
"How in the world am I going to
compare a string to a number?",00:10:41.000,00:10:44.030
"So, see how good my aim
is, ah, not bad.",00:10:44.030,00:10:46.990
All right.,00:10:46.990,00:10:47.880

Yeah.,00:10:58.240,00:10:58.890
All right?,00:10:58.890,00:10:59.210
"So, what in the world's
going on here?",00:10:59.210,00:11:01.290
This is a place--,00:11:01.290,00:11:02.220
"I don't know about you, John,
I think this is actually",00:11:02.220,00:11:04.150
"really not good, because right,
what this is doing is,",00:11:04.150,00:11:07.900
"it's allowing-- sorry, let me
back up and say it-- it's got",00:11:07.900,00:11:12.280
"an overload on the less-than
that allows you to compare",00:11:12.280,00:11:14.800
"basically the lexicographic
ordering, or this sequence of",00:11:14.800,00:11:18.360
"ordering of symbols, including
numbers inside of the machine.",00:11:18.360,00:11:22.680
"And this, in my mind, should
have been an error.",00:11:22.680,00:11:24.550
"Why in the world would you
want to compare that?",00:11:24.550,00:11:26.750
"Just to give you an example of
that, for instance, I can do",00:11:26.750,00:11:29.510
"the following: all right, the
number four is less than the",00:11:29.510,00:11:35.360
"string three, whereas the string
four, oops, is not less",00:11:35.360,00:11:42.370
than the string three.,00:11:42.370,00:11:43.740
"And this is a place where it's
comparing strings and numbers",00:11:43.740,00:11:46.210
in a strange way.,00:11:46.210,00:11:47.750
So why am I showing you this?,00:11:47.750,00:11:48.920
"Partly to show you that it's
kind of weird, but also to",00:11:48.920,00:11:51.620
"tell you that one of the things
you want to do is",00:11:51.620,00:11:56.210
"exercise what I'm going to call
some type discipline.",00:11:56.210,00:12:00.510
"Meaning, when you write code,
you want to get into the habit",00:12:00.510,00:12:05.100
"of A, checking out operators or
procedures to see what they",00:12:05.100,00:12:08.250
"do under different
circumstances, either check",00:12:08.250,00:12:10.320
"them out or read the
specifications of it, and two,",00:12:10.320,00:12:13.100
"when you write your own code,
you want to be disciplined",00:12:13.100,00:12:15.740
"about what types of arguments
or operands",00:12:15.740,00:12:18.280
you apply to operators.,00:12:18.280,00:12:20.620
"Because this is something that
could certainly have screwed",00:12:20.620,00:12:22.540
"you up if you didn't realize
it did it, and you need to",00:12:22.540,00:12:25.370
"have that discipline
to make sure it's",00:12:25.370,00:12:26.550
doing the right thing.,00:12:26.550,00:12:29.160
OK.,00:12:29.160,00:12:30.570
"One of the other things you're
going to see is that some of",00:12:30.570,00:12:33.420
"the operators have
odd meanings.",00:12:33.420,00:12:36.080
"And again, I think we looked--",00:12:36.080,00:12:37.290
Yup?,00:12:37.290,00:12:37.770
"STUDENT: So, the string A is
less than three, is false",00:12:37.770,00:12:40.130
"because they're comparing
like ASCII values?",00:12:40.130,00:12:40.340
PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON: Yes.,00:12:40.340,00:12:45.360
"I mean, I'm sorry.",00:12:45.360,00:12:46.340
"The answer is, I don't
know if it's ASCII.",00:12:46.340,00:12:47.550
"John, do you know, are
they doing ASCII",00:12:47.550,00:12:48.870
encoding inside of here?,00:12:48.870,00:12:49.830
I'm assuming so.,00:12:49.830,00:12:51.540
Right.,00:12:51.540,00:12:51.780
"So, in case you didn't
understand what the the",00:12:51.780,00:12:53.320
"question was, basically every
symbol gets translated into a",00:12:53.320,00:12:57.910
"particular encoding, a string
of bit, if you like, inside",00:12:57.910,00:13:00.710
"the machine, there's a
particular one called ASCII,",00:13:00.710,00:13:02.450
"which is, if you like, an
ordering of that, and that's",00:13:02.450,00:13:05.400
"what the machine's actually
comparing inside of here,",00:13:05.400,00:13:07.200
"which is why in under ASCII
encoding the numbers are going",00:13:07.200,00:13:09.830
"to appear after the characters,
and you get the",00:13:09.830,00:13:12.530
strange kind of thing going on.,00:13:12.530,00:13:14.930
All right.,00:13:14.930,00:13:15.160
"I want a couple of other things,
just to quickly remind",00:13:15.160,00:13:16.960
"you, and one of them is,
remember, the operators do",00:13:16.960,00:13:19.020
"look at the types, so division,
for example nine",00:13:19.020,00:13:21.490
"divided by five is one, because
this is integer",00:13:21.490,00:13:25.290
"division, that is, it's the
largest number of integer",00:13:25.290,00:13:27.930
"multiples of five to go into
nine, and there would be a",00:13:27.930,00:13:30.680
"remainder associated with it,
which is in fact four.",00:13:30.680,00:13:36.580
"And again, you've got
to be careful about",00:13:36.580,00:13:37.810
how you use the operators.,00:13:37.810,00:13:40.010
"Right, having done that, we
can certainly get to more",00:13:40.010,00:13:41.890
"complicated things, so for
example, suppose I look at",00:13:41.890,00:13:46.060
that expression.,00:13:46.060,00:13:47.660
Three plus four times five.,00:13:47.660,00:13:50.570
All right.,00:13:50.570,00:13:51.680
Now.,00:13:51.680,00:13:52.180
"There are two possible
values here, I think.",00:13:52.180,00:13:55.420
"One is 23, the other's 35.",00:13:55.420,00:13:57.770
"Because this could be three plus
four, times five, or it",00:13:57.770,00:14:03.370
"could be three, plus
four times five.",00:14:03.370,00:14:07.150
"And of course, you know, when
you look at code it doesn't",00:14:07.150,00:14:08.990
pause in between them.,00:14:08.990,00:14:09.780
But what I do?,00:14:09.780,00:14:10.360
"I just separated, do I do the
addition first or do the",00:14:10.360,00:14:12.620
multiplication first?,00:14:12.620,00:14:14.520
"Anybody know what happens
In this case?",00:14:14.520,00:14:15.800
"Yeah, way up, oh God I'm going
to have a hell of time",00:14:15.800,00:14:17.210
"throwing up there, way
up at the back.",00:14:17.210,00:14:18.320
"STUDENT: Standard order of
operations, I guess take the",00:14:18.320,00:14:25.604
"multiplication first,
and add the three.",00:14:25.604,00:14:26.040
PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON: Right.,00:14:26.040,00:14:26.361
"I'm going to try, if I don't
make it, you know, just get",00:14:26.361,00:14:27.800
"somebody to pass back, whoa!",00:14:27.800,00:14:29.220
"I just hit somebody
in the head.",00:14:29.220,00:14:30.214
Thank you.,00:14:30.214,00:14:30.340
"Please pass it back
to that guy.",00:14:30.340,00:14:32.220
"If you want candy, sit much
closer down, and that way we",00:14:32.220,00:14:34.410
"can film you as well
as we go along.",00:14:34.410,00:14:36.310
Right.,00:14:36.310,00:14:36.590
"So the point is, there is
something here called operator",00:14:36.590,00:14:39.000
"precedence, which is what
the gentleman said.",00:14:39.000,00:14:45.530
"I'm not going to say much more
about it, but basically what",00:14:45.530,00:14:48.150
"it says is, with all other
things being equal, things",00:14:48.150,00:14:52.110
"like exponentiation are done
before you do multiplication",00:14:52.110,00:14:56.750
"or division, which are done
before you do things like",00:14:56.750,00:15:00.100
addition and subtraction.,00:15:00.100,00:15:02.320
"And so, in fact, if I wanted
the other version of it, in",00:15:02.320,00:15:04.485
"fact, if I do this right, it's
going to give me 23 because it",00:15:04.485,00:15:06.730
"does the multiplication first,
if I wanted the other version",00:15:06.730,00:15:09.370
"of it, I need to tell it that,
by using, excuse me,",00:15:09.370,00:15:13.160
parentheses.,00:15:13.160,00:15:14.970
"And in general, what I
would say is, when",00:15:14.970,00:15:16.720
"in doubt, use parens.",00:15:16.720,00:15:26.410
OK.,00:15:26.410,00:15:29.010
"Now, that just gives
us expressions.",00:15:29.010,00:15:32.830
"We can start having complex
expressions, you can imagine",00:15:32.830,00:15:35.110
"we can have things are lots of
parens, and all sorts of",00:15:35.110,00:15:36.920
things in it.,00:15:36.920,00:15:37.340
"Yes, question.",00:15:37.340,00:15:38.010
"STUDENT: What does it mean, the
operator used, when you",00:15:38.010,00:15:46.102
"were calculating the remainder
between nine and five?",00:15:46.102,00:15:46.260
"PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON: It's
the percent sign.",00:15:46.260,00:15:46.540
"If you can't read it, I guess
I'm going to have to blow that",00:15:46.540,00:15:47.230
"font up, aren't I,
next time around.",00:15:47.230,00:15:47.820
"Yeah, it's a percent, so
this percent sign will",00:15:47.820,00:15:49.354
give you the remainder.,00:15:49.354,00:15:52.480
OK.,00:15:52.480,00:15:53.540
"Second thing I need to do,
though, is I need to, when I",00:15:53.540,00:15:55.670
"get those values, I want
to hang on to them.",00:15:55.670,00:15:57.560
"I'd like to give them a name,
so I can refer to them in",00:15:57.560,00:15:59.710
other places.,00:15:59.710,00:16:00.900
"And so we saw that as well, the
last piece we had here is",00:16:00.900,00:16:05.012
"the ability to create variables,
which have their",00:16:05.012,00:16:12.880
"own values, and that's done
using an assignment statement.",00:16:12.880,00:16:20.100
"So in particular, that is
an assignment statement.",00:16:20.100,00:16:24.380
"It says, take the name x and
create a binding for that name",00:16:24.380,00:16:29.060
"to the value of the
sub-expression and in fact to",00:16:29.060,00:16:31.180
"do this, to stress a point,
let's do that.",00:16:31.180,00:16:35.300
"It's not just a number,
it's any expression.",00:16:35.300,00:16:39.130
"What Python will do, is it will
evaluate that expression",00:16:39.130,00:16:41.790
"using the kinds of rules we
talked about, and then it",00:16:41.790,00:16:43.570
"creates a binding for
x to that value.",00:16:43.570,00:16:45.690
"And I want to stress this, we're
going to come back to it",00:16:45.690,00:16:47.340
"later on in the term, so the
way I'd like you to think",00:16:47.340,00:16:50.060
"about it for now, is that
somewhere in the machine,",00:16:50.060,00:16:53.330
"there's a big space that
contains all possible values.",00:16:53.330,00:16:57.080
Right.,00:16:57.080,00:16:57.250
"It's a slight lie, it doesn't
have all possible values, but",00:16:57.250,00:16:59.420
you get the idea.,00:16:59.420,00:17:00.050
"It has, if you like,
intellectually,",00:17:00.050,00:17:01.640
all possible values.,00:17:01.640,00:17:03.100
"And when I create a binding, I'm
taking a variable name, in",00:17:03.100,00:17:07.310
"this case x, stored somewhere in
a table, and I'm creating a",00:17:07.310,00:17:11.140
"link or a pointer from that
name to that value.",00:17:11.140,00:17:20.410
This is a nuance.,00:17:20.410,00:17:21.740
"It's going to make a lot more
sense later on when we",00:17:21.740,00:17:23.480
"introduce mutation into our
language, but I want you to",00:17:23.480,00:17:26.040
start thinking of it that way.,00:17:26.040,00:17:26.870
"Don't think of it as a specific
box into which we're",00:17:26.870,00:17:29.660
"putting things; think of it
as a link to a value.",00:17:29.660,00:17:32.920
"I could have, for example,
another assignment statement,",00:17:32.920,00:17:37.540
"and that creates a binding from
y into that same value,",00:17:37.540,00:17:45.630
"and one of the things as a
conservist I can do is, I",00:17:45.630,00:17:47.710
"could have a statement like,
let z be bound to",00:17:47.710,00:17:53.180
the value of x.,00:17:53.180,00:17:54.340
"And I said it deliberately
that way.",00:17:54.340,00:17:55.700
"That statement says, get the
value of x, which is this",00:17:55.700,00:17:58.715
"link, and give z a pointer
to the same place.",00:17:58.715,00:18:05.250
"To the value, not to x.",00:18:05.250,00:18:08.770
"OK, and we'll just plant that
idea, we're going to come back",00:18:08.770,00:18:10.470
"to later on, as we carry on.",00:18:10.470,00:18:13.980
OK.,00:18:13.980,00:18:14.390
"So if we have variables, one
of the questions we can ask",00:18:14.390,00:18:17.770
"is, what's the type
of the variable.",00:18:17.770,00:18:25.500
"And the answer is, it inherits
it from its value.",00:18:25.500,00:18:28.830
OK.,00:18:28.830,00:18:30.550
Yes.,00:18:30.550,00:18:35.810
"So if somewhere in my code, I
have that statement, that",00:18:35.810,00:18:39.380
"assignment statement,
x now is a variable",00:18:39.380,00:18:41.520
whose value is an integer.,00:18:41.520,00:18:44.670
"Unfortunately, at least in
my mind, in Python, these",00:18:44.670,00:18:47.980
"variable bindings are
dynamic, or the",00:18:47.980,00:18:51.550
"type, rather, is dynamic.",00:18:51.550,00:18:55.590
"Meaning, it changes depending on
what the current value is.",00:18:55.590,00:19:00.990
"Or said a different way, if
somewhere later on in the",00:19:00.990,00:19:03.330
"program I do this, x
now has changed its",00:19:03.330,00:19:10.110
type from INT to string.,00:19:10.110,00:19:14.270
Now why should you care?,00:19:14.270,00:19:16.130
"OK, my view is, I
don't like it.",00:19:16.130,00:19:21.110
"Especially in the presence
of operator overload.",00:19:21.110,00:19:24.330
"Because I might have written
some code in which I'm",00:19:24.330,00:19:26.450
"expecting that particular
variable to",00:19:26.450,00:19:28.180
have an integer value.,00:19:28.180,00:19:29.040
"If somewhere later on in the
code it shifts to string, I",00:19:29.040,00:19:32.640
"might not be manipulating that
and getting actual values out,",00:19:32.640,00:19:35.650
"but not what I wanted, and it's
going to be really hard",00:19:35.650,00:19:37.850
for me to chase it back.,00:19:37.850,00:19:39.450
"So one of the things I would
like to suggest is that you",00:19:39.450,00:19:41.540
"develop some good style here,
and in particular, don't",00:19:41.540,00:19:46.330
change types arbitrarily.,00:19:46.330,00:19:52.360
I can't spell today.,00:19:52.360,00:19:59.380
"Meaning, sometimes you need
to do this, but in general",00:19:59.380,00:20:01.570
"there's-- at least in my view
and I don't, John, would you",00:20:01.570,00:20:03.300
"agree?-- you just don't
want to do this.",00:20:03.300,00:20:04.350
"You don't want to make
those changes.",00:20:04.350,00:20:05.640
"It just leads to trouble
down the road.",00:20:05.640,00:20:08.920
OK.,00:20:08.920,00:20:10.530
"Now, last thing about variables,
and then we're",00:20:10.530,00:20:12.173
"going to start pushing
on this, is",00:20:12.173,00:20:13.230
where can you use them?,00:20:13.230,00:20:14.820
"And the answer is, you can use
a variable anywhere you can",00:20:14.820,00:20:19.610
use the value.,00:20:19.610,00:20:20.300
"So, any place it's legal
to use the value.",00:20:20.300,00:20:32.630
OK.,00:20:32.630,00:20:35.750
Now.,00:20:35.750,00:20:36.900
"This is just sort of bringing us
back up to speed and adding",00:20:36.900,00:20:39.420
a few more details in.,00:20:39.420,00:20:40.240
"What we really want to
do now though is",00:20:40.240,00:20:42.290
start using this stuff.,00:20:42.290,00:20:44.900
"So, operands.",00:20:44.900,00:20:46.880
"Let us take expressions, get
values out, we can store them",00:20:46.880,00:20:49.890
"away in places, but ultimately
we want to do something with",00:20:49.890,00:20:52.450
"them, so we need to now start
talking about what are the",00:20:52.450,00:20:54.390
"things we can do inside of
Python, or any programming",00:20:54.390,00:20:56.740
"language, to manipulate them.",00:20:56.740,00:20:58.640
"And for that, we're going
to have statements.",00:20:58.640,00:21:08.960
"Statements are basically, if
you want to think about it,",00:21:08.960,00:21:13.610
"legal, and I was about to use
the word expression except",00:21:13.610,00:21:15.980
"I've misused that elsewhere, so
legal commands that Python",00:21:15.980,00:21:24.530
can interpret.,00:21:24.530,00:21:30.040
"You've already seen
a couple of them.",00:21:30.040,00:21:32.520
"Print, assignment, certainly
two obvious statements,",00:21:32.520,00:21:39.650
"they're commands to
do something.",00:21:39.650,00:21:41.000
"Assignment is binding a name
to a value, print is saying",00:21:41.000,00:21:43.660
put it back out in the screen.,00:21:43.660,00:21:45.160
"Obviously if you have print as
a way of putting things out,",00:21:45.160,00:21:47.240
"we expect to have ways of
getting input in, we're going",00:21:47.240,00:21:48.940
"to see an example that
in the second.",00:21:48.940,00:21:50.630
"And as we go through the next
few lectures, we're going to",00:21:50.630,00:21:52.340
"add in more and more of
these statements.",00:21:52.340,00:21:54.190
"But let's look at what we
could do with this, OK?",00:21:54.190,00:21:56.830
"And to do this, I'm going to
use some code that I've",00:21:56.830,00:21:59.240
already typed in.,00:21:59.240,00:22:00.450
"So I'm hoping you can
read that, and it's",00:22:00.450,00:22:01.850
also in your handout.,00:22:01.850,00:22:03.210
"This is a little file I created,
all right, and I'm",00:22:03.210,00:22:06.780
"going to start with a sequence
of these things and walk them",00:22:06.780,00:22:09.850
"along, again I invite you to put
comments on that handout",00:22:09.850,00:22:12.440
"so that you can follow what
we're going to do.",00:22:12.440,00:22:14.830
All right?,00:22:14.830,00:22:15.450
"So let's look at the
first part of this.",00:22:15.450,00:22:16.730
"Right now, this is
just a text file.",00:22:16.730,00:22:19.520
OK.,00:22:19.520,00:22:19.700
"And I've highlighted in blue up
there one of the pieces I'm",00:22:19.700,00:22:21.790
going to start with.,00:22:21.790,00:22:22.870
And what do I have?,00:22:22.870,00:22:23.380
"I have a sequence of commands;
I've got an assignment",00:22:23.380,00:22:25.320
"statement, I've got another
assignment statement, I've got",00:22:25.320,00:22:27.710
"a print statement, I've got an
input statement, which we'll",00:22:27.710,00:22:29.900
come back to in a second.,00:22:29.900,00:22:31.940
"And I want to basically try
and use these things to do",00:22:31.940,00:22:34.350
something with them.,00:22:34.350,00:22:35.660
"Second thing I want to note is,
the little hash mark or",00:22:35.660,00:22:38.270
"the pound sign, that's
identifying a comment.",00:22:38.270,00:22:41.600
So what's a comment?,00:22:41.600,00:22:42.390
"It's words to you, or to the
reader of the code, that are",00:22:42.390,00:22:46.060
"telling you what's going
on inside of this code.",00:22:46.060,00:22:47.980
OK?,00:22:47.980,00:22:49.690
"Now, these comments, frankly,
are brain-damaged, or",00:22:49.690,00:22:54.770
"computationally challenged
if you prefer.",00:22:54.770,00:22:57.330
"Meaning, why in the world do I
have to tell the reader that",00:22:57.330,00:23:00.590
"I'm binding x to the
value three?",00:23:00.590,00:23:02.480
All right?,00:23:02.480,00:23:02.770
"I'm putting them in there
to make a point.",00:23:02.770,00:23:04.870
"In general, good programming
style says you put in comments",00:23:04.870,00:23:08.510
"that are going to be valuable
in helping you as a reader",00:23:08.510,00:23:11.880
"understand what's going
on inside of the code.",00:23:11.880,00:23:14.780
"It could be, what's the
intuition behind",00:23:14.780,00:23:16.430
this piece of code.,00:23:16.430,00:23:17.080
"It could be, preconditions
I want to have on input.",00:23:17.080,00:23:19.580
"It could be, explanations of
specific things you're doing.",00:23:19.580,00:23:22.420
"But you need to have those
comments there.",00:23:22.420,00:23:25.320
"Now, this becomes a little bit
of one of those motherhood and",00:23:25.320,00:23:27.540
apple pie kinds of lectures.,00:23:27.540,00:23:28.800
"You know, your mother always
told you to eat brussels",00:23:28.800,00:23:30.370
"sprouts because it
was good for you.",00:23:30.370,00:23:32.270
"Well this is a brussels sprouts
comment. everybody",00:23:32.270,00:23:34.050
"goes yeah, yeah, yeah,
comments, of course.",00:23:34.050,00:23:35.480
"Of course we're going
to do comments.",00:23:35.480,00:23:36.580
And they never do.,00:23:36.580,00:23:38.250
"So my challenge to you, and I
know Professor Guttag can do",00:23:38.250,00:23:40.730
"this, my challenge to you is, a
year from now, come back and",00:23:40.730,00:23:44.800
look at code you wrote here.,00:23:44.800,00:23:46.650
"Can you still understand what it
was you were trying to do?",00:23:46.650,00:23:50.860
"I don't know, John, if
you'd agree, right?",00:23:50.860,00:23:52.170
"If you can read the code a
year later, even code you",00:23:52.170,00:23:54.210
"wrote yourself, it's a good
sign that you put good",00:23:54.210,00:23:56.630
"comments in, right?",00:23:56.630,00:23:59.340
"Second good piece
of style here is",00:23:59.340,00:24:01.360
choice of variable names.,00:24:01.360,00:24:03.530
These are lousy.,00:24:03.530,00:24:05.200
Deliberately.,00:24:05.200,00:24:06.040
OK?,00:24:06.040,00:24:06.840
"I'm just using simple things
like x and y and z because I",00:24:06.840,00:24:09.260
"want to make it, just
get through the",00:24:09.260,00:24:10.600
lecture if you like.,00:24:10.600,00:24:11.340
"But in general, the choice of
variable name is a great way",00:24:11.340,00:24:14.310
of commenting your code.,00:24:14.310,00:24:15.860
"Use variable names
that make sense.",00:24:15.860,00:24:19.000
"That little problem set
zero that you did.",00:24:19.000,00:24:21.250
"You read in a couple
of values, you",00:24:21.250,00:24:22.340
probably stored them away.,00:24:22.340,00:24:23.960
"My bet is, you used simple
names like x and y.",00:24:23.960,00:24:27.340
"A much better name would have
been firstname, lastname, as",00:24:27.340,00:24:29.790
"the name of the variable to tell
you what you were trying",00:24:29.790,00:24:31.650
to capture there.,00:24:31.650,00:24:33.540
OK.,00:24:33.540,00:24:34.390
"The other piece I want to say
about variable names is, once",00:24:34.390,00:24:38.300
"I have that choice of variable
name, I can use it, but in",00:24:38.300,00:24:41.980
"fact there are a few things that
I can't use in terms of",00:24:41.980,00:24:44.260
variable names.,00:24:44.260,00:24:45.030
"So, these are an important way
of documenting, but there're",00:24:45.030,00:24:58.100
some things excluded.,00:24:58.100,00:24:59.040
"And in particular, there are
some key words that Python is",00:24:59.040,00:25:04.210
"going to use that have
to be excluded.",00:25:04.210,00:25:07.270
Let me highlight that.,00:25:07.270,00:25:09.180
"As I said, right now that's
just text file.",00:25:09.180,00:25:10.860
"I'm going to save this away--
yeah, not that way, I'm going",00:25:10.860,00:25:15.560
"to save this away-- with the
subscript, or the suffix",00:25:15.560,00:25:22.700
"rather, py to make
it a Python file.",00:25:22.700,00:25:25.480
"Yeah, and I know it's already
there but I'm going to do it,",00:25:25.480,00:25:28.600
"and I get some wonderful
colors.",00:25:28.600,00:25:30.920
"But these are important, OK?",00:25:30.920,00:25:33.130
"So notice what I have
up there now.",00:25:33.130,00:25:34.640
Comments appear in red.,00:25:34.640,00:25:35.830
I can see those.,00:25:35.830,00:25:37.310
"There's a keyword, which I'm
going to highlight right up",00:25:37.310,00:25:39.580
"here, print, which is in,
I don't know what",00:25:39.580,00:25:41.850
"that color is, orange?",00:25:41.850,00:25:44.550
"There's a function in purple,
there's a string in green, and",00:25:44.550,00:25:48.330
"in black I have the assignment
statements.",00:25:48.330,00:25:51.160
That print is a keyword.,00:25:51.160,00:25:53.260
"It's a command to Python
to do something.",00:25:53.260,00:25:56.980
"As a consequence, I can't use
it as a variable name.",00:25:56.980,00:26:00.690
"All right, think about
it for a second.",00:26:00.690,00:26:01.780
"If I wanted to use print as a
variable name, how do I get",00:26:01.780,00:26:04.680
"the system to decide gee, do
I want print as a value for",00:26:04.680,00:26:08.980
"something, or do I want
print as a command?",00:26:08.980,00:26:11.560
"So there's a sequence of these
that are blocked out, and I--",00:26:11.560,00:26:13.670
"John, I think there are
what, twenty-eight?",00:26:13.670,00:26:16.340
"Something like that,
TAs, is that right?",00:26:16.340,00:26:18.020
"Twenty-eight keywords
that are blocked?",00:26:18.020,00:26:20.930
"We'll find them as
we go along--",00:26:20.930,00:26:23.240
OK.,00:26:23.240,00:26:24.530
"Having done this now, I can
simply go ahead and run this,",00:26:24.530,00:26:26.710
"and in fact if I go up here to
run, you'll see I've got both",00:26:26.710,00:26:29.120
"an option to check the module,
though in this case I'm just",00:26:29.120,00:26:31.800
going to run it.,00:26:31.800,00:26:33.790
"Oh, notice what happened.",00:26:33.790,00:26:35.340
"It ran through that sequence of
instructions, in particular",00:26:35.340,00:26:37.620
"it bound x to the value three,
and then it took x times x,",00:26:37.620,00:26:41.450
"got the value of x multipied by
x, which of course is nine,",00:26:41.450,00:26:43.800
"bound that to the value of x,
and then it printed out the",00:26:43.800,00:26:46.670
"value, and now it's sitting
here waiting for an input.",00:26:46.670,00:26:49.610
"You notice what it did, it
printed out that little, right",00:26:49.610,00:26:52.180
"up here I'd said enter a number
and that's what it's",00:26:52.180,00:26:53.980
"printed out, so I can enter a
number and it prints it out.",00:26:53.980,00:26:58.790
Great.,00:26:58.790,00:27:00.450
Let's run it again.,00:27:00.450,00:27:01.950
"Actually for that, I can just
use, if I'm lucky, function",00:27:01.950,00:27:04.370
"F5, which didn't work, so let me
try it again., here we go.",00:27:04.370,00:27:09.220
We're going to run that module.,00:27:09.220,00:27:11.550
OK.,00:27:11.550,00:27:14.690
Whoa.,00:27:14.690,00:27:17.050
What happened?,00:27:17.050,00:27:20.030
I said enter a number.,00:27:20.030,00:27:20.810
I didn't.,00:27:20.810,00:27:21.130
I gave it a string.,00:27:21.130,00:27:21.970
And it still took it.,00:27:21.970,00:27:23.240
And printed it up.,00:27:23.240,00:27:25.080
"Well, this is one of the places
where I want to come",00:27:25.080,00:27:26.790
"back to that highlighting
of what do things do?",00:27:26.790,00:27:29.840
"Even though my statement said
enter a number, in particular,",00:27:29.840,00:27:33.370
"raw input here simply takes in a
set of characters and treats",00:27:33.370,00:27:37.040
it as a string.,00:27:37.040,00:27:38.390
And then prints it back out.,00:27:38.390,00:27:39.930
"So if in fact I wanted to make
sure this was a number, I",00:27:39.930,00:27:42.220
"should have done something like
either try and convert it",00:27:42.220,00:27:44.460
"to a number, which of course
failed here, or put in a check",00:27:44.460,00:27:47.330
to say where it is.,00:27:47.330,00:27:48.610
"So it's a way of reminding you,
I've got to be careful",00:27:48.610,00:27:50.620
"about the types of things
that I put in.",00:27:50.620,00:27:53.530
OK.,00:27:53.530,00:27:56.380
"This is still boring, so let's
step on the accelerator.",00:27:56.380,00:28:01.100
"What I have now is the
following: I can write",00:28:01.100,00:28:04.710
"expressions, do combinations of
things to get out values, I",00:28:04.710,00:28:07.660
"can store them away, I
can print them up.",00:28:07.660,00:28:11.260
"But literally all I can do at
this stage is write what we",00:28:11.260,00:28:13.760
"would call a straight-line
program, that is, a program in",00:28:13.760,00:28:18.060
"which we execute in which we
execute the sequence of",00:28:18.060,00:28:28.540
instructions one by one.,00:28:28.540,00:28:31.300
"Simply walk down that
list. That's what we",00:28:31.300,00:28:34.240
"just did there, right?",00:28:34.240,00:28:34.790
"We just walked through that
list. This is boring.",00:28:34.790,00:28:36.780
"In fact, you can do some nice
things to prove what is the",00:28:36.780,00:28:39.290
"class of functions you can
compute with straight-line",00:28:39.290,00:28:42.220
"programs, and what you'd see if
you did that is, it's not",00:28:42.220,00:28:44.330
particularly interesting.,00:28:44.330,00:28:46.730
OK.,00:28:46.730,00:28:48.050
"Let's go back and think
about our recipes.",00:28:48.050,00:28:49.890
"What we use as our
motivation here.",00:28:49.890,00:28:52.010
"Even in real recipes, you
have things like,",00:28:52.010,00:28:54.880
"if needed, add sugar.",00:28:54.880,00:28:59.210
That's a decision.,00:28:59.210,00:29:00.320
That's a conditional.,00:29:00.320,00:29:01.520
That's a branch.,00:29:01.520,00:29:02.340
"That says, if something
is true, do something.",00:29:02.340,00:29:04.910
"Otherwise, do something
different.",00:29:04.910,00:29:06.970
"So to really add to this, we
need to have branching",00:29:06.970,00:29:09.510
"programs. What I mean by that
is, a branching program is",00:29:09.510,00:29:19.370
"something that can change the
order of instructions based on",00:29:19.370,00:29:32.750
"some test. And that test is
usually a value of a variable.",00:29:32.750,00:29:46.620
OK.,00:29:46.620,00:29:47.730
"And these get a whole lot
more interesting.",00:29:47.730,00:29:49.910
"So let's look at a little
example, and this is going to,",00:29:49.910,00:29:52.260
"excuse me, both allow us
introduce the syntax as well",00:29:52.260,00:29:54.590
"as what we want to have
as the flow of",00:29:54.590,00:29:56.520
control inside of here.,00:29:56.520,00:29:57.530
"So let me go back up here, and
I'm going to comment out that",00:29:57.530,00:30:02.960
"region, and let's uncomment
this region.",00:30:02.960,00:30:10.250
"I want to write a little
piece of code.",00:30:10.250,00:30:12.480
"It's going to print out even or
odd, depending on whether",00:30:12.480,00:30:14.890
"the value I put in, which is x
in this case, is even or odd.",00:30:14.890,00:30:19.100
Think about that.,00:30:19.100,00:30:20.860
"That says, if this thing has
some particular value, I want",00:30:20.860,00:30:24.490
"to do one thing; otherwise,
I want to",00:30:24.490,00:30:26.420
do something different.,00:30:26.420,00:30:28.010
"And let's look at the
syntax of this.",00:30:28.010,00:30:29.970
"This is the first of the
conditionals that",00:30:29.970,00:30:31.936
we're going to see.,00:30:31.936,00:30:36.530
Notice the format.,00:30:36.530,00:30:38.740
I'm going to go up there.,00:30:38.740,00:30:39.290
"The first statement right
here, that's just an",00:30:39.290,00:30:41.360
"assignment statement, I'm
giving some value to x.",00:30:41.360,00:30:43.100
"We could make it something
different.",00:30:43.100,00:30:45.100
"And then, notice the
structure here.",00:30:45.100,00:30:47.360
The next three statements.,00:30:47.360,00:30:48.310
"First of all, IF is a keyword.
which makes sense.",00:30:48.310,00:30:50.900
"It is followed, as you can see
there, by some expression,",00:30:50.900,00:30:55.430
followed by a colon.,00:30:55.430,00:30:56.360
"And in fact, that colon is
important, so let me stress",00:30:56.360,00:30:59.950
this over here.,00:30:59.950,00:31:00.680
"The colon is important It's
defining the beginning of a",00:31:00.680,00:31:11.930
block of instructions.,00:31:11.930,00:31:12.970
Yes sir.,00:31:12.970,00:31:13.380
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE],00:31:13.380,00:31:17.200
"PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON: Based on
a test. Usually the value",00:31:17.200,00:31:19.150
of a variable.,00:31:19.150,00:31:21.490
"OK, so let me go back
to where I am.",00:31:21.490,00:31:22.620
"I'm looking at that
piece of code.",00:31:22.620,00:31:23.580
"What that colon is saying is,
I'm about to begin a sequence",00:31:23.580,00:31:27.260
"of instructions that I want
to treat as a block.",00:31:27.260,00:31:29.840
"So it identifies a block
of instructions.",00:31:29.840,00:31:38.940
"It's, and in particular, the
colon is the start, and the",00:31:38.940,00:31:43.000
carriage return is the end.,00:31:43.000,00:31:48.340
"Now what in the world
does that mean?",00:31:48.340,00:31:49.210
"I'm doing a lot of words here,
let me try and say this a",00:31:49.210,00:31:50.930
little bit better.,00:31:50.930,00:31:51.540
"That code says the following:
the IF says, I've got an",00:31:51.540,00:31:54.290
"expression, I'm going
to evaluate it.",00:31:54.290,00:31:56.540
"If that value is true, I want
to do a set of things.",00:31:56.540,00:32:01.350
"And that set of things is
identified by the sequence of",00:32:01.350,00:32:04.230
"commands that are indented in,
this one right here, following",00:32:04.230,00:32:09.020
"the colon but before I get
back to the same place in",00:32:09.020,00:32:12.600
terms of the indentation.,00:32:12.600,00:32:14.940
"If that test is not true, I want
to skip this instruction,",00:32:14.940,00:32:19.780
"and there's a second keyword
else, followed by a colon, and",00:32:19.780,00:32:23.340
"that tells me the thing
I want to do in the",00:32:23.340,00:32:24.880
case that it's false.,00:32:24.880,00:32:26.880
"So in fact if I run this,
ah, and save it, and",00:32:26.880,00:32:36.020
it prints out odd.,00:32:36.020,00:32:37.680
"So, what happened here?",00:32:37.680,00:32:39.250
"Well, let's look at the code.",00:32:39.250,00:32:41.250
"Right? x is initially
bound to fifteen.",00:32:41.250,00:32:43.410
I get to the IF.,00:32:43.410,00:32:44.250
"The IF says, evaluate that
next expression.",00:32:44.250,00:32:46.550
"In that next expression, I'm
actually taking advantage of",00:32:46.550,00:32:49.270
"the fact that I'm doing integer
multiplication and",00:32:49.270,00:32:51.380
division here.,00:32:51.380,00:32:52.720
"Right, that divide is, if x is
an integer and two is an",00:32:52.720,00:32:55.100
"integer, what's it
going to do?",00:32:55.100,00:32:56.000
"If x was even, x divided by two
is going to be actually",00:32:56.000,00:32:59.670
"the half of x, right?",00:32:59.670,00:33:02.200
"If x is odd, that integer
division is going to give me",00:33:02.200,00:33:04.740
"the number of multiples of two,
that go into x, plus a",00:33:04.740,00:33:08.340
"remainder, which I'm going
to throw away.",00:33:08.340,00:33:11.580
"In either case, I take that
value and multiply back by",00:33:11.580,00:33:13.970
"two, if it was even I get back
the original number, if it was",00:33:13.970,00:33:17.930
"odd, I'm not going to get back
the original number, so I can",00:33:17.930,00:33:20.530
"just check to see if
they're the same.",00:33:20.530,00:33:22.940
"OK, so a little nuance
that I'm using there.",00:33:22.940,00:33:24.510
"So, the first thing that IF
does, bleah that IF says is,",00:33:24.510,00:33:26.560
"evaluate that expression and
if it's true, do the next",00:33:26.560,00:33:30.220
"thing, the thing after
the colon.",00:33:30.220,00:33:31.820
"In this case it's not true, so
it's going to skip down and",00:33:31.820,00:33:34.290
"evaluate the thing printed
up the odd.",00:33:34.290,00:33:38.110

to the point.",00:34:08.160,00:34:09.420
What does an equal sign do?,00:34:09.420,00:34:10.520
It is an assignment.,00:34:10.520,00:34:11.560
"It says, take this thing on the
left and use it as a name",00:34:11.560,00:34:14.790
"to bind to the value
on the right.",00:34:14.790,00:34:17.050
It's not what I want here.,00:34:17.050,00:34:17.950
"Having already chosen to use
equal as an assignment, I need",00:34:17.950,00:34:20.720
"something else to
do comparison.",00:34:20.720,00:34:23.130
"And that's why I use
double equals.",00:34:23.130,00:34:24.570

saying, is this thing equal",00:34:24.570,00:34:27.320
"to, in value, the thing
on the other side?",00:34:27.320,00:34:31.450
OK.,00:34:31.450,00:34:32.780

want to stress this idea and",00:34:32.780,00:34:36.050
"I'm going to write it out one
more time, that there's a",00:34:36.050,00:34:38.520
particular format here.,00:34:38.520,00:34:42.780

of instructions.",00:34:54.080,00:35:02.470

at the same level, and when we",00:35:23.860,00:35:26.740

OK.,00:35:31.070,00:35:32.900
"Now, that's a nice simple little
test, let's look at a",00:35:32.900,00:35:35.750
"couple of other examples
to get a sense of",00:35:35.750,00:35:37.460

value, and then I'm",00:35:51.470,00:35:53.670

"OK, so why?",00:36:03.590,00:36:04.240
"Well, let's look at it.",00:36:04.240,00:36:05.010

if the string x is less than",00:36:05.010,00:36:08.950

appear before b as strings,",00:36:08.950,00:36:12.680

couple of things, because",00:36:12.680,00:36:16.550
"they're at the same
block level.",00:36:16.550,00:36:18.930
"Given that that wasn't
true, it did nothing.",00:36:18.930,00:36:22.330
"Now, wait a minute, you say,
where's the ELSE clause?",00:36:22.330,00:36:25.010
"And the answer is,
I don't need one.",00:36:25.010,00:36:26.390
"All right, if this is purely a
test of, if this is true do",00:36:26.390,00:36:29.820
"this otherwise I don't care, I
don't need the ELSE clause in",00:36:29.820,00:36:32.590
there to identify it.,00:36:32.590,00:36:33.120
All right?,00:36:33.120,00:36:35.820
"Second thing I want to look at
is, suppose I compare that the",00:36:35.820,00:36:39.100
one below it.,00:36:39.100,00:36:39.760
"Oops, that I don't want to do.",00:36:39.760,00:36:45.720
"Comment that out, and let's
uncomment this.",00:36:45.720,00:36:53.840
"Yeah, I've still got a binding
for z and I'm giving it the",00:36:53.840,00:36:56.310
"same test, but notice now I've
got the two same commands but",00:36:56.310,00:36:59.710
"they have different
indentation.",00:36:59.710,00:37:01.830
"In this case, in fact I do
get a different behavior.",00:37:01.830,00:37:08.790
Why?,00:37:08.790,00:37:10.330
"Because that block identifies a
set of things that I'm going",00:37:10.330,00:37:14.100
to do if the test is true.,00:37:14.100,00:37:16.090
"If the test was not true, notice
that that last command",00:37:16.090,00:37:18.630
"for print Mon is now back at the
same level as the IF, so",00:37:18.630,00:37:21.520
"what this says is the IF does
the test, having done the",00:37:21.520,00:37:25.190
"test, it decides I'm not going
to do anything in the block",00:37:25.190,00:37:27.300
"below it, I'm going to skip
down therefore to the next",00:37:27.300,00:37:29.830
"instruction at the same level
as the IF, which gets me to",00:37:29.830,00:37:32.850
the second print statement.,00:37:32.850,00:37:35.690
OK.,00:37:35.690,00:37:36.140
"So now we're seeing some of
these variations, let's see",00:37:36.140,00:37:38.830
what else can we do here.,00:37:38.830,00:37:39.800
"So let me just to try something
a little more",00:37:39.800,00:37:41.550
"interesting, and then we'll
get to writing some simple",00:37:41.550,00:37:43.520
"programs. So I'm going to
comment those out, and let's",00:37:43.520,00:37:47.000
"go down to this piece of
code, and uncomment it.",00:37:47.000,00:37:53.820
"Ooh yes, that was brilliant.",00:37:53.820,00:37:55.710
Let's try this again.,00:37:55.710,00:37:59.010
"And uncomment that, and
uncomment it again.",00:37:59.010,00:38:04.980
"Right, so here's a little piece
of code that's going to",00:38:04.980,00:38:06.870
"print out the smallest
value of three.",00:38:06.870,00:38:09.670
"And notice what this
is showing is that",00:38:09.670,00:38:12.140
the IFs can be nested.,00:38:12.140,00:38:13.760
"All right, it's so if I looked
at it, it's going to say that",00:38:13.760,00:38:15.390
"IF x is y-- sorry, IF x is less
than y, THEN check to see",00:38:15.390,00:38:18.860
"IF x is less than z, and if
that's true, print out x is",00:38:18.860,00:38:22.930
"the smallest. And notice the
structure of it, if it's not",00:38:22.930,00:38:26.260
"true I'm going to go to that
next ELSE, and print out that",00:38:26.260,00:38:28.380
"z is smallest. If the first test
wasn't true, I'm going to",00:38:28.380,00:38:31.330
"skip that whole block and just
go down and print out that y",00:38:31.330,00:38:33.680
"was smallest. So notice the
nesting, I can flow my way",00:38:33.680,00:38:37.190
"through how those tests are
actually going to take place.",00:38:37.190,00:38:40.240
"All right, so let's run this
and see what happens.",00:38:40.240,00:38:46.570
Great. y is smallest. OK.,00:38:46.570,00:38:50.970
Is that code correct?,00:38:50.970,00:38:55.070
"Is that a tentative
hand back there?",00:38:55.070,00:38:56.680
Yeah.,00:38:56.680,00:38:57.650
"STUDENT: Let me compare
y to [INAUDIBLE]",00:38:57.650,00:39:00.900
"PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON: Yeah,
it's not doing all of the",00:39:00.900,00:39:02.320
comparisons.,00:39:02.320,00:39:03.440
"All right, and let's just check
this out, because I want",00:39:03.440,00:39:05.055
"to make a point of this, let's
go back and do the following.",00:39:05.055,00:39:08.220
"Let's take y, change it to
thirteen, let's run it, hmm.",00:39:08.220,00:39:18.150
So what did I miss here?,00:39:18.150,00:39:20.380
Two important points.,00:39:20.380,00:39:22.120
"First one, when I write a piece
of code, especially code",00:39:22.120,00:39:24.770
"that has branches in it, when
I design test cases for that",00:39:24.770,00:39:28.600
"piece of code, I should try and
have a specific test case",00:39:28.600,00:39:32.310
"for each possible path
through the code.",00:39:32.310,00:39:35.940
"And by just doing that, I just
spotted, there's a bug here.",00:39:35.940,00:39:38.640
"And the bug was in my thinking,
I did not look for",00:39:38.640,00:39:40.440
all of the tests.,00:39:40.440,00:39:41.110
"So the way I can fix that, is,
let me comment that out, and",00:39:41.110,00:39:49.680
"keep doing that, comment that
out, let's uncomment this,",00:39:49.680,00:40:03.610
notice the structure here.,00:40:03.610,00:40:04.880
I now have multiple tests.,00:40:04.880,00:40:06.610
"So actually, let's just run
it and then we'll talk",00:40:06.610,00:40:08.340
about what it does.,00:40:08.340,00:40:09.140
"I run this, yeah, I have a
syntax error, yes indeed,",00:40:09.140,00:40:16.320
"because I forgot to comment that
one out, all right, and",00:40:16.320,00:40:20.060
"cue, we'll try it again.",00:40:20.060,00:40:27.640
Ah-ha!,00:40:27.640,00:40:29.200
"And let's quickly look at
the structure of this.",00:40:29.200,00:40:31.940
"This now has, gee, a funny
thing, it says IF x is less",00:40:31.940,00:40:34.740
"than y AND x is less than
z, then do something.",00:40:34.740,00:40:39.530
"And then it has a strange thing
called ELIF, which is",00:40:39.530,00:40:42.300
"simply short for else/if in a
second test. So the way to",00:40:42.300,00:40:46.210
"think about this in terms of
flow is, it starts with that",00:40:46.210,00:40:48.370
"if and it says, check both
of those things.",00:40:48.370,00:40:51.470
"And that fact that both of those
things is the fact that",00:40:51.470,00:40:54.000
"we're using Boolean
combination here.",00:40:54.000,00:41:06.520
"It is to say, we can take any
logical expressions, combine",00:41:06.520,00:41:11.510
"them together with AND, OR,
or NOT to make a complex",00:41:11.510,00:41:14.440
"expression, and use the value of
that expression as my test.",00:41:14.440,00:41:17.830
"And that's literally what I've
done there, right, I've got x",00:41:17.830,00:41:19.755
"less than y, that's a test, it
returns a Boolean, which by",00:41:19.755,00:41:22.000
"the way is the other type, at
least I would include here, it",00:41:22.000,00:41:25.125
"has only two values, which are
true and false, and what that",00:41:25.125,00:41:32.880
"code says, if x is less than y,
AND, logically, whatever I",00:41:32.880,00:41:37.870
"put up there, x is less than
z, then the combination is",00:41:37.870,00:41:42.620
"true, and therefore I'm
going to do something.",00:41:42.620,00:41:44.610
"So AND is if both arguments are
true it's true, OR is if",00:41:44.610,00:41:47.850
"either argument it's true it's
true, NOT is if the argument",00:41:47.850,00:41:50.330
"is not true it's true, and then
the last piece, as I said",00:41:50.330,00:41:53.565
"is, I can now have a sequence
of things I want to do.",00:41:53.565,00:41:56.540
"So if this is true do something
else, otherwise test",00:41:56.540,00:41:58.690
"and see if this is true, do
something else, as many as I",00:41:58.690,00:42:00.960
like followed by the end.,00:42:00.960,00:42:02.200
"And ELSE, it says, here's
what I want to do.",00:42:02.200,00:42:05.560
OK.,00:42:05.560,00:42:07.050
Now.,00:42:07.050,00:42:09.080
"Having added this in, I have
branching instructions.",00:42:09.080,00:42:12.330
"I have simple branching
programs. These are still",00:42:12.330,00:42:15.260
awfully simple.,00:42:15.260,00:42:16.450
OK?,00:42:16.450,00:42:16.645
"And they're awfully simple
because, all I can do now, is",00:42:16.645,00:42:20.530
"decide whether to execute some
piece of code or another.",00:42:20.530,00:42:24.440
"Said a different way, in the
case of the straight-line",00:42:24.440,00:42:26.430
"programs, how long would it
take to run a program?",00:42:26.430,00:42:29.360
"Well, basically, however many
instructions I have, because",00:42:29.360,00:42:31.760
"I've got to do each
one in order.",00:42:31.760,00:42:33.690
"With simple branching, how long
is it going to take to",00:42:33.690,00:42:36.720
run a piece of code?,00:42:36.720,00:42:38.430
"Well at most, I'm going to
execute each instruction once.",00:42:38.430,00:42:42.240
All right?,00:42:42.240,00:42:42.350
"Because the IFs are saying, if
it's true do this, otherwise",00:42:42.350,00:42:44.320
skip on it.,00:42:44.320,00:42:46.070
"Therefore, for simple branching
programs, the length",00:42:46.070,00:42:48.820
"of time, the complexity
the code, is what",00:42:48.820,00:42:52.250
we would call constant.,00:42:52.250,00:42:53.630
"That is, it's at most the length
of the actual number of",00:42:53.630,00:42:56.560
instructions.,00:42:56.560,00:42:57.080
"It doesn't depend
on the input.",00:42:57.080,00:42:59.840
Real simple programs.,00:42:59.840,00:43:00.880
"Let's take another
simple example.",00:43:00.880,00:43:02.130
"Suppose I want to compute
the average age",00:43:02.130,00:43:03.980

"There's about a thousand
of us.",00:43:05.750,00:43:07.470
"However I do that, I know that
should inherently take more",00:43:07.470,00:43:10.570
"time than it takes to compute
the average age of all the",00:43:10.570,00:43:12.880
EECS faculty.,00:43:12.880,00:43:14.180
There's only 125 of us.,00:43:14.180,00:43:16.080

than what it takes to compute",00:43:16.080,00:43:19.200
"the average of John's and my
ages, instructors in 600,",00:43:19.200,00:43:21.960
"because there's only
two of us.",00:43:21.960,00:43:23.020
"All right, those pieces of
code inherently involved",00:43:23.020,00:43:27.730
"something that does depend on
the size of the input, or on",00:43:27.730,00:43:30.920
the particular input.,00:43:30.920,00:43:32.470
"And that is a preface to an
idea of computational",00:43:32.470,00:43:35.060
"complexity we're going
to come back to.",00:43:35.060,00:43:36.270

help you do is identify the",00:43:36.270,00:43:38.500

"efficient class to do
the computation.",00:43:43.930,00:43:47.200
OK.,00:43:47.200,00:43:47.670

see what I want to do.",00:43:53.790,00:43:55.400
"I, somehow if, I want to walk
through some sequence of data",00:43:55.400,00:43:57.960

of code for that?",00:44:04.960,00:44:07.580
"Well, let's go back
up to our original",00:44:07.580,00:44:09.230
starting point of recipes.,00:44:09.230,00:44:10.370
"And I'm sure you don't remember,
but one of the",00:44:10.370,00:44:13.120
"things I had in my recipe, is
beat egg whites until stiff.",00:44:13.120,00:44:18.820
OK.,00:44:18.820,00:44:19.200
"That until is an
important word.",00:44:19.200,00:44:21.410
"It's actually defining a test.
Let me rephrase it into",00:44:21.410,00:44:24.560
"garbled English that'll lead
more naturally into what I",00:44:24.560,00:44:26.760

"While the egg whites are

"true, do something, but I
want to keep doing it.",00:44:36.860,00:44:40.970
"And so for that, we need
to add one last thing.",00:44:40.970,00:44:45.020

"What does this piece
of code say?",00:45:15.480,00:45:17.890
"Not, what does it do, but
what does it say.",00:45:17.890,00:45:19.090
"Well, the first three statements
are just assignment",00:45:19.090,00:45:21.140

"I'm binding x, y, and iters
left to some values.",00:45:21.370,00:45:25.130

left, I've got a comment that",00:45:52.050,00:45:53.890
"I had borrowed in order to do
some debugging, and then what",00:45:53.890,00:45:57.070
do I want it to do?,00:45:57.070,00:45:57.840
"I want it to go back around to
the test. Once again, say, is",00:45:57.840,00:46:02.190
that test true?,00:46:02.190,00:46:03.940
"If it is true, execute the
sequence of instructions.",00:46:03.940,00:46:07.490
"So in fact we can block this
out and see what it does.",00:46:07.490,00:46:10.040
"If I make a little chart here,
I've got x, y, and iters left.",00:46:10.040,00:46:16.400
"x starts off as I think I set
it up as, here I can't even",00:46:16.400,00:46:19.600
"read it, is x is three, y is
zero, iters left is three.",00:46:19.600,00:46:24.800
I can hand-simulate it.,00:46:24.800,00:46:25.940
"It says, is the value of iters
left greater than zero?",00:46:25.940,00:46:28.070
Yes it is.,00:46:28.070,00:46:28.510
"So, execute those two
instructions.",00:46:28.510,00:46:30.710
"It says, take value of y and
value of x, add them together,",00:46:30.710,00:46:34.560
"and create that as the
new value of y.",00:46:34.560,00:46:36.600
All right.,00:46:36.600,00:46:36.760
That's the assigned statement.,00:46:36.760,00:46:38.310
"It says, take iters left,
subtract one from it, and bind",00:46:38.310,00:46:41.310
"that as the new value
of iters left.",00:46:41.310,00:46:44.830
"Having reached the end of the
block, go back up and check",00:46:44.830,00:46:47.000
"the test. Is iters left
greater than zero?",00:46:47.000,00:46:49.570
Yes it is.,00:46:49.570,00:46:50.550
"So, evaluate the same sequence
of instructions again. y plus",00:46:50.550,00:46:54.270
"x is six, that's my new value
of y, two minus one is one,",00:46:54.270,00:46:57.320
"that's my new value of iters
left, go back up.",00:46:57.320,00:47:00.300
"Is iters left greater
than zero?",00:47:00.300,00:47:01.990
Yes it is.,00:47:01.990,00:47:02.720
"So once more, thank God I didn't
take 47 as an example,",00:47:02.720,00:47:07.150
"x plus y, subtract one from
iters left, go back up to the",00:47:07.150,00:47:12.050
"test. Is iters left's value
greater than zero?",00:47:12.050,00:47:14.560
"No, it is not.",00:47:14.560,00:47:16.380
"Therefore, skip the rest of that
block of code and go to",00:47:16.380,00:47:20.190
"the next instruction, which
is, ah, print out y.",00:47:20.190,00:47:24.620
"In fact, if we test this,
son of a gun.",00:47:24.620,00:47:29.270
"Got a simple square
procedure,.",00:47:29.270,00:47:32.060
"Right, It's just squaring an
integer, is what it's doing.",00:47:32.060,00:47:34.860
But notice the structure.,00:47:34.860,00:47:36.150
"Now I have the ability to create
a loop, that is, to",00:47:36.150,00:47:39.080
"reuse the same pieces of
code over and over",00:47:39.080,00:47:41.880
again as I go around.,00:47:41.880,00:47:43.870
"And this adds, now, a lot
of power to the kinds",00:47:43.870,00:47:47.030
of code I can write.,00:47:47.030,00:47:49.040
"Notice some other things I want
to highlight on this.",00:47:49.040,00:47:51.610
All right?,00:47:51.610,00:47:52.610
"The first one is, that test
has to involve-- shouldn't",00:47:52.610,00:47:57.240
"have to, but almost always is
going to involve-- the value",00:47:57.240,00:47:59.300
of some variable.,00:47:59.300,00:48:01.470
"What if I don't change the value
of that variable inside",00:48:01.470,00:48:05.340
of the code?,00:48:05.340,00:48:05.960
"Or, another way of saying it
is, what if I did this?",00:48:05.960,00:48:11.730
Comment it up.,00:48:11.730,00:48:13.950
"What happens if I
run this sucker?",00:48:13.950,00:48:15.170
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:48:15.170,00:48:17.650
PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON: Yeah.,00:48:17.650,00:48:19.210
It'll go forever.,00:48:19.210,00:48:20.230
"Absolutely, right?",00:48:20.230,00:48:21.590
"It's going to loop into
an infinite loop--",00:48:21.590,00:48:23.390
"I think I can hit this close,
ah, no I can't, boy what a",00:48:23.390,00:48:26.690
terrible aim--,00:48:26.690,00:48:27.940
"All right, what has
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] try",00:48:27.940,00:48:30.120
"again, the point I'm trying to
make here-- thank God we're at",00:48:30.120,00:48:32.200
"the end of this lecture, my
tongue is falling apart-- the",00:48:32.200,00:48:34.330
"point I'm trying to make is,
that test needs to involve",00:48:34.330,00:48:37.940
"some loop variable
that is changing.",00:48:37.940,00:48:40.870
"Otherwise the test is always
going to be true, we're going",00:48:40.870,00:48:42.575
"to go off here, but this would
loop forever if I did that.",00:48:42.575,00:48:45.320
All right.,00:48:45.320,00:48:45.710
"Second question: or maybe a
better way of saying this, and",00:48:45.710,00:48:49.100
"the general format you're likely
to see here is, a test",00:48:49.100,00:48:51.980
"involving a variable name,
which must be initialized",00:48:51.980,00:48:54.770
"outside of the loop, and which
interior to the loop gets",00:48:54.770,00:48:57.910
"changed, so that the test
is going to change.",00:48:57.910,00:49:00.870
Here's the second question.,00:49:00.870,00:49:02.750
"What value of inputs, what
values of x will this run",00:49:02.750,00:49:05.280
correctly for?,00:49:05.280,00:49:08.530
"Probably should be
integers, right?",00:49:08.530,00:49:10.770
"Otherwise, this is going to be
doing something strange, but",00:49:10.770,00:49:13.130
all integers?,00:49:13.130,00:49:16.340
"All right, suppose I do this.",00:49:16.340,00:49:18.350
It's my last example.,00:49:18.350,00:49:24.320
"Yeah, how about that, right?",00:49:24.320,00:49:26.730
"We knew this was trying to do
squaring, so intellectually we",00:49:26.730,00:49:29.450
"know we can square -4, it
ought to be 16, but what",00:49:29.450,00:49:31.840
happens here?,00:49:31.840,00:49:33.630
Double fudge knuckle.,00:49:33.630,00:49:34.940
All right?,00:49:34.940,00:49:35.960
"It's going to run through the
loop, accumulating the",00:49:35.960,00:49:39.000
"answers, but because I'm
subtracting, it's just going",00:49:39.000,00:49:41.385
"to keep making x more and more
negative as it goes along,",00:49:41.385,00:49:44.690
"again it's off into
an infinite loop.",00:49:44.690,00:49:46.680
"Which is a way of reminding you
that I need to think as I",00:49:46.680,00:49:49.360
"write the code about what are
my expectations from the",00:49:49.360,00:49:52.232
"input, and how might
I enforce them.",00:49:52.232,00:49:54.160
"In this case, I probably want
to make sure I use absolute",00:49:54.160,00:49:56.050
"value of x before
I carry it on.",00:49:56.050,00:49:57.350
Yes ma'am.,00:49:57.350,00:50:03.450
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE],00:50:03.450,00:50:11.130
"PROFESSOR JIM ERICSON: You're
absolutely right, because I",00:50:11.130,00:50:13.840
"bind iters left to, um, yeah.",00:50:13.840,00:50:16.440
Yes.,00:50:16.440,00:50:16.650
Thank you.,00:50:16.650,00:50:16.980
"Boy, two candy for you.",00:50:16.980,00:50:19.260
You caught me making an error.,00:50:19.260,00:50:20.390
Yes.,00:50:20.390,00:50:21.040
"The point is, it's not going to
work, and she caught both",00:50:21.040,00:50:24.230
"of them, impressive, it's not
going to work because iters",00:50:24.230,00:50:26.090
"left is already negative, it's
just going to skip the whole",00:50:26.090,00:50:27.980
"loop, and I'm in trouble, so
thank you for catching that.",00:50:27.980,00:50:31.120
All right.,00:50:31.120,00:50:31.370
"I was going to do one more
example, but I've run you up",00:50:31.370,00:50:33.380
to the end of the time.,00:50:33.380,00:50:34.160

handout, it shows you another",00:50:34.160,00:50:36.290

now have the ability to create",00:50:38.150,00:50:41.880
