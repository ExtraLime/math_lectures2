"PROFESSOR: So we're going
to do a problem that",00:00:27.000,00:00:28.980
looks like the guitar problem.,00:00:28.980,00:00:30.330
But it's a bit cooler.,00:00:30.330,00:00:31.912
"At the same time,
there are fewer states,",00:00:31.912,00:00:33.620
"so I think it's
easier to manage.",00:00:33.620,00:00:35.370
"How many people know
how to play DDR?",00:00:35.370,00:00:38.286
AUDIENCE: Well.,00:00:38.286,00:00:39.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:00:39.190,00:00:40.480
OK.,00:00:40.480,00:00:40.980
"How many people know the
rules of playing DDR?",00:00:40.980,00:00:43.832
"Because otherwise I won't
be able to lift my hand up.",00:00:43.832,00:00:46.040
OK.,00:00:46.040,00:00:47.970
"OK, so let's go through
an algorithmic model.",00:00:47.970,00:00:51.640
"So, you have a board that
basically looks like this.",00:00:51.640,00:00:58.510
"And you have four
touch sensitive pads.",00:00:58.510,00:01:03.090
"Up, down, left, right.",00:01:03.090,00:01:05.140
"And then you have
a center position.",00:01:05.140,00:01:08.230
"You also have a sheet of notes
that looks something like this.",00:01:08.230,00:01:13.340
"Say, up, up down, down, up
down, up, up down, left right,",00:01:13.340,00:01:23.700
"left, left right, right.",00:01:23.700,00:01:27.039
So on and so forth.,00:01:27.039,00:01:27.830
"So when you see an
arrow of up, that's",00:01:31.120,00:01:34.760
"a constraint that
says one of your feet",00:01:34.760,00:01:37.130
has to be on the up arrow.,00:01:37.130,00:01:40.310
"Has to tap the up
arrow, actually.",00:01:40.310,00:01:43.410
"There's no constraint
for the other foot.",00:01:43.410,00:01:45.470
"So your other foot can be
anywhere else on the board.",00:01:45.470,00:01:47.770
It doesn't matter.,00:01:47.770,00:01:49.340
"You are also allowed to tap
the board some extra times.",00:01:49.340,00:01:52.980
"So if you don't have
a note showing up,",00:01:52.980,00:01:57.130
you can still hit the board.,00:01:57.130,00:01:58.780
And there's no penalty.,00:01:58.780,00:02:00.340
"So you can hop around as
many times as you want,",00:02:00.340,00:02:02.340
"or as many times as you can,
until you run out of breath.",00:02:02.340,00:02:06.260
"So up basically means, it's
actually one foot has to be up.",00:02:06.260,00:02:09.550
The other one center.,00:02:09.550,00:02:11.100
"Also, of course, because
of the design of the board,",00:02:11.100,00:02:13.589
"it doesn't matter
what foot is where.",00:02:13.589,00:02:15.130
"So what are possible
goals for this game?",00:02:18.180,00:02:22.251
AUDIENCE: Not to get an F.,00:02:22.251,00:02:25.000
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:02:25.000,00:02:27.240
"AUDIENCE: Hit all
the arrows when",00:02:27.240,00:02:29.711
they line up with the top row.,00:02:29.711,00:02:32.637
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:02:32.637,00:02:33.220
"So there are two different
ways of doing it.",00:02:33.220,00:02:36.680
"One, you said,
""not to get an F.""",00:02:36.680,00:02:38.660
"So I would say, given some
limited set of skills.",00:02:38.660,00:02:44.020
"So given a set of skills,
or your skill level",00:02:44.020,00:02:49.220
maximizes your score. right?,00:02:49.220,00:02:50.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:02:50.980,00:02:51.606
"PROFESSOR: This is
dynamic programming,",00:02:51.606,00:02:53.230
"so we always want to
maximize something.",00:02:53.230,00:02:55.115
"Now, if you're really good,
then another possible goal",00:02:58.550,00:03:02.160
"is hit all the notes with
a minimum amount of effort.",00:03:02.160,00:03:10.740
"If you're going to
be in a competition,",00:03:13.495,00:03:15.120
"and you're going to
be doing 10 songs,",00:03:15.120,00:03:16.703
"you don't want to die after
the first song, right?",00:03:16.703,00:03:19.890
"So, assuming you can do
everything reasonably well,",00:03:19.890,00:03:22.370
this is another possible goal.,00:03:22.370,00:03:25.830
Any other goals?,00:03:25.830,00:03:28.804
So we're brainstorming here.,00:03:28.804,00:03:29.970
This isn't set in stone.,00:03:29.970,00:03:32.210
"We've already seen the formal
solution for this problem.",00:03:32.210,00:03:36.150
"So I want to play with it
for a little bit, right?",00:03:36.150,00:03:38.430
"We brought a DDR pad, so
I want to play with it.",00:03:38.430,00:03:42.910
"What else could you hope
to maximize or minimize",00:03:42.910,00:03:45.990
for with dynamic programming?,00:03:45.990,00:03:47.205
AUDIENCE: Not look ridiculous.,00:03:51.262,00:03:54.590
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:03:54.590,00:03:56.470
"AUDIENCE: I guess we're looking
at the cost of each move,",00:03:56.470,00:03:59.961
right?,00:03:59.961,00:04:00.460
"PROFESSOR: So,
hit all the notes.",00:04:00.460,00:04:02.180
"Minimum effort, or otherwise
say best appearance.",00:04:02.180,00:04:09.685
"So every move looks somewhat
good or somewhat bad.",00:04:13.530,00:04:18.230
"And you want to do the moves
that look as good as possible.",00:04:18.230,00:04:21.269
"So this maximizes
entertainment, right?",00:04:21.269,00:04:23.410
"if you're on TV, you
probably want this.",00:04:28.640,00:04:32.830
"Now suppose you are
in a competition",00:04:32.830,00:04:34.590
"and you only have
one track to play.",00:04:34.590,00:04:36.640
"AUDIENCE: Well, you know
where all the notes are.",00:04:41.920,00:04:45.254
PROFESSOR: Sure.,00:04:45.254,00:04:45.920
"Like, we assume that we
know this ahead of time.",00:04:45.920,00:04:47.919
So you've memorized this.,00:04:47.919,00:04:49.032
"And you're trying to
compute the best strategy,",00:04:49.032,00:04:50.990
so you can memorize that.,00:04:50.990,00:04:52.031
"Then when you go and
play, you dominate.",00:04:52.031,00:04:53.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:04:53.980,00:04:55.220
"PROFESSOR: So, if
you have one track,",00:04:55.220,00:04:56.769
"then I would say that
what you'd want to do",00:04:56.769,00:04:58.560
"is minimize your
probability of failure.",00:04:58.560,00:05:00.950
Right?,00:05:00.950,00:05:01.450
"So given the probability of
failure for each possible move.",00:05:01.450,00:05:05.459
"You want to minimize the
overall probability of failure",00:05:05.459,00:05:07.750
"so your teammates
won't hate you.",00:05:07.750,00:05:10.170
"So, hit all the
notes and minimize.",00:05:10.170,00:05:14.386
"So this one's a little bit
different from the other ones",00:05:24.037,00:05:26.370
"because all the other
ones are already",00:05:26.370,00:05:27.953
"set up as a nice problem
where you add up things.",00:05:27.953,00:05:30.390
"So you can solve
them with graphs",00:05:30.390,00:05:31.880
or with dynamic programming.,00:05:31.880,00:05:33.770
"If you want to minimize
the probability of failure,",00:05:33.770,00:05:36.580
"then you want to maximize
the probability of success.",00:05:36.580,00:05:39.320
"The probability of
succeeding on all your moves",00:05:39.320,00:05:41.840
"is the product of
the probability",00:05:41.840,00:05:44.550
of succeeding on each move.,00:05:44.550,00:05:46.321
All right?,00:05:46.321,00:05:46.820
"So if you have five
moves, then you",00:05:46.820,00:05:48.110
"have five individual
probabilities.",00:05:48.110,00:05:49.590
You multiply them up.,00:05:49.590,00:05:50.540
"And that's the probability that
you execute the whole sequence",00:05:50.540,00:05:53.820
"correctly, and not stumble.",00:05:53.820,00:05:55.930
"So we have products
instead of sums.",00:05:55.930,00:05:57.430
Yes?,00:05:57.430,00:05:57.760
"AUDIENCE: Isn't it related
to the maximizing score goal?",00:05:57.760,00:06:00.093
PROFESSOR: You can.,00:06:04.580,00:06:07.240
"Well, not necessarily
because this one",00:06:07.240,00:06:09.210
"says that you only have
some possible moves.",00:06:09.210,00:06:12.520
"I think in the end, all of
them, except for this last one,",00:06:12.520,00:06:15.450
"can be solved using the
recursion depth we have for it.",00:06:15.450,00:06:17.840
"The last one, you have
to do a bit of massaging.",00:06:17.840,00:06:19.840
"And we're going
over that right now.",00:06:19.840,00:06:21.339
"So, you have products
instead of sums.",00:06:24.430,00:06:29.610
"How do you turn
products into sums?",00:06:29.610,00:06:31.695
AUDIENCE: Logs?,00:06:31.695,00:06:32.910
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:06:32.910,00:06:33.850
"So, for this one, I
would want to use logs,",00:06:33.850,00:06:38.220
"so that I can say that
I want to maximize",00:06:38.220,00:06:40.450
the log probability of success.,00:06:40.450,00:06:42.200
"Which is just the sum of the
log probabilities for each move.",00:06:42.200,00:06:45.660
"And then it looks like
dynamic programming, as usual.",00:06:45.660,00:06:49.580
"Now, if I wouldn't
want to use logs,",00:06:49.580,00:06:51.550
"if I'm using the DP formulation,
where I'm doing recursion,",00:06:51.550,00:06:56.920
"I can incorporate
products there.",00:06:56.920,00:06:58.790
"But it turns out,
I didn't practice.",00:06:58.790,00:07:00.290
"If you have a lot of
numbers that are close to 1,",00:07:00.290,00:07:02.331
"or that are close to 0,
so all the easy moves",00:07:02.331,00:07:05.070
"are going to be really
close to 1, for example.",00:07:05.070,00:07:07.920
"If you have a lot of numbers
that are close to 1 or close",00:07:07.920,00:07:10.310
"to 0, if you
multiply them up, you",00:07:10.310,00:07:12.460
get numerical instabilities.,00:07:12.460,00:07:13.830
"So we get the number
that's really close to 1.",00:07:13.830,00:07:18.000
"So for example, if I'm choosing
whether to do, say I'm here,",00:07:18.000,00:07:23.100
"and I'm thinking, do I
want to move like this?",00:07:23.100,00:07:26.230
"Or do I want to move like
this, and then like this?",00:07:26.230,00:07:31.260
"These are both
pretty easy moves.",00:07:31.260,00:07:32.970
"So, in both cases, we're
looking at probabilities",00:07:32.970,00:07:35.785
of success of 99.991%.,00:07:35.785,00:07:38.560
And maybe 99.992%.,00:07:38.560,00:07:42.010
"So if you have numbers
with probabilities",00:07:42.010,00:07:44.445
"that are really close to 1,
and if you have a lot of them",00:07:44.445,00:07:46.820
"and you try to
multiply them, you're",00:07:46.820,00:07:48.960
going to get a bad result.,00:07:48.960,00:07:50.990
"So all the products are going
to start looking the same.",00:07:50.990,00:07:54.440
"So we're going to get
a random solution,",00:07:54.440,00:07:56.140
instead of what you want.,00:07:56.140,00:07:57.530
This is a practical thing.,00:07:57.530,00:07:58.640
"It's called numerical
instability.",00:07:58.640,00:08:00.100
"And it's a practical
reason why you'd",00:08:00.100,00:08:02.310
"want to use logs, instead
of multiplying things up.",00:08:02.310,00:08:06.789
"So it's not just a
theoretical thing.",00:08:06.789,00:08:08.330
"It also makes life
nice in practice.",00:08:08.330,00:08:12.200
OK.,00:08:12.200,00:08:12.700
"So we have a goal
that looks like this.",00:08:12.700,00:08:15.270
"Say, let's go for this one.",00:08:15.270,00:08:16.630
"Hit all the notes,
minimize the effort.",00:08:16.630,00:08:18.820
"And all the other ones can
be reduced to this one.",00:08:18.820,00:08:23.480
"We need to define effort, right?",00:08:23.480,00:08:25.490
"Let's say that we have a
function called delta, that",00:08:25.490,00:08:29.300
"takes two foot locations--
so, where both of my feet",00:08:29.300,00:08:33.280
are-- from and to.,00:08:33.280,00:08:38.500
"And it gives me a number from
0 to 1, where 0 is really easy.",00:08:38.500,00:08:48.470
And 1 is really hard.,00:08:48.470,00:08:49.980
"So from would look something
like, my left foot is up.",00:08:54.190,00:08:58.480
My right foot is centered.,00:08:58.480,00:09:00.230
"To would look something like,
my left foot is centered",00:09:00.230,00:09:04.230
and my right foot is up.,00:09:04.230,00:09:05.550
"So basically going
from here to here.",00:09:05.550,00:09:10.730
So from left foot up.,00:09:10.730,00:09:12.427
Right foot center.,00:09:12.427,00:09:13.330
To here.,00:09:13.330,00:09:13.960
"So there is some
difficulty there, right?",00:09:16.432,00:09:18.140
"We have to jump, so it's not 0.",00:09:18.140,00:09:19.830
I'm burning some calories here.,00:09:19.830,00:09:23.230
"So any move that I make
has some difficulty.",00:09:23.230,00:09:25.530
"And I want to solve the
game so that overall I",00:09:25.530,00:09:28.300
"have a reasonably
small total difficulty.",00:09:28.300,00:09:32.450
"OK, are we understanding
the problem?",00:09:37.290,00:09:41.130
"So we have three
possible avenues here.",00:09:41.130,00:09:43.610
"We can start solving it
using dynamic programming.",00:09:43.610,00:09:47.040
"We can start solving
it using graphs.",00:09:47.040,00:09:49.550
"Or we can have someone else
play the DDR again so that we",00:09:49.550,00:09:52.670
"can get more hands
on experience,",00:09:52.670,00:09:54.120
"and look at what a good strategy
or a bad strategy looks like.",00:09:54.120,00:09:57.860
So you guys get to vote.,00:09:57.860,00:09:58.860
"Who wants to solve this using
the dynamic programming?",00:09:58.860,00:10:01.790
"Who wants to solve
this using graphs?",00:10:04.490,00:10:08.550
"Who wants to get more
hands on experience?",00:10:08.550,00:10:10.380
Damn.,00:10:13.020,00:10:15.160
I was hoping that DDR would win.,00:10:15.160,00:10:17.280
You guys are boring.,00:10:17.280,00:10:19.620
"So, graphs, right?",00:10:19.620,00:10:20.832
We're going to have notes.,00:10:20.832,00:10:21.915
"Notes represent states, right?",00:10:26.360,00:10:27.820
"So a state is where you are
at some point in the game.",00:10:27.820,00:10:31.300
"And we'll have to define
what where you are means.",00:10:31.300,00:10:34.510
"And then, when you
jump, you make a move.",00:10:34.510,00:10:37.550
So moves go between states.,00:10:37.550,00:10:40.150
"So in any game, you
have states and moves.",00:10:40.150,00:10:42.370
"A state is very
hard to put in time.",00:10:42.370,00:10:43.980
And then you make a move.,00:10:43.980,00:10:45.021
Like in chess.,00:10:45.021,00:10:45.620
"Your state is your
board position.",00:10:45.620,00:10:47.270
"And whether you're
moving, or your opponent",00:10:47.270,00:10:49.200
is the next to move.,00:10:49.200,00:10:50.865
"And the move is when you take a
piece and put it from one place",00:10:50.865,00:10:53.490
to another.,00:10:53.490,00:10:53.989
So your vertices are states.,00:10:58.160,00:10:59.710
And your edges are moves.,00:10:59.710,00:11:03.270
So what's in a state?,00:11:05.900,00:11:10.110
This is our problem.,00:11:10.110,00:11:12.050
"Whether we're solving
it with graphs",00:11:12.050,00:11:13.740
"or with dynamic
programming, this",00:11:13.740,00:11:16.140
"is what everything
comes down to.",00:11:16.140,00:11:17.937
What's in the state?,00:11:17.937,00:11:18.770
"AUDIENCE: So your current
state is how much difficulty",00:11:29.190,00:11:31.440
have you-- what is the problem?,00:11:31.440,00:11:33.920
"Are those representing
the probabilities,",00:11:33.920,00:11:36.672
the difficulties?,00:11:36.672,00:11:37.380
Or.,00:11:37.380,00:11:38.400
"PROFESSOR: So this is the
difficulty for one move.",00:11:38.400,00:11:41.460
"Does it depend on
previous moves?",00:11:41.460,00:11:44.000
"AUDIENCE: No, but.",00:11:44.000,00:11:44.797
PROFESSOR: No.,00:11:44.797,00:11:45.380
"So it's a nice thing to
note that the difficulties",00:11:45.380,00:11:47.530
for each move are independent.,00:11:47.530,00:11:48.779
"AUDIENCE: Would it be
dependent in real life?",00:11:58.746,00:12:01.216
You'll get tired at the end.,00:12:01.216,00:12:02.698
"And he's able to
have less energy.",00:12:02.698,00:12:05.168
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:12:07.545,00:12:08.170
"So, in real life, we might
want to say that this actually",00:12:08.170,00:12:12.060
"depends on how much energy
you've expended so far.",00:12:12.060,00:12:15.870
"And if we have time,
let's solve that problem.",00:12:15.870,00:12:18.740
"So the nice thing
about this problem",00:12:25.180,00:12:26.680
"is there are many directions
in which we can take it.",00:12:26.680,00:12:29.950
This is one of them.,00:12:29.950,00:12:30.920
I'm fine.,00:12:30.920,00:12:32.000
"And I think we'll learn
a lot by doing that.",00:12:32.000,00:12:34.780
So back to the original problem.,00:12:34.780,00:12:37.340
"Suppose that it doesn't
matter how tired you are.",00:12:37.340,00:12:40.100
"You're pretty
good, so you're not",00:12:40.100,00:12:41.720
"going to be tired
enough to go [GASP].",00:12:41.720,00:12:43.413
"So, mostly independent
difficulties for each move.",00:12:46.520,00:12:50.020
What's in a state?,00:12:50.020,00:12:53.240
"AUDIENCE: The sum of the
difficulties up to that point.",00:12:53.240,00:12:56.417
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:12:56.417,00:12:57.000
So.,00:12:57.000,00:12:57.500
"AUDIENCE: Your
appearance factor,",00:13:09.666,00:13:11.765
if we're including that.,00:13:11.765,00:13:12.885
Or are we only doing--,00:13:12.885,00:13:13.610
PROFESSOR: So we're doing this.,00:13:13.610,00:13:14.901
"AUDIENCE: Oh, I was just.",00:13:16.760,00:13:17.801
"Oh, effort.",00:13:17.801,00:13:18.763
"OK, we're minimizing effort.",00:13:18.763,00:13:19.930
"PROFESSOR: So the way
I like to think of this",00:13:19.930,00:13:21.804
"is, what is does a
solution look like?",00:13:21.804,00:13:23.590
"It's made up of
decisions, right?",00:13:23.590,00:13:25.458
What are the decisions?,00:13:25.458,00:13:26.416
"AUDIENCE: To make that move
or don't make that move?",00:13:29.090,00:13:33.500
PROFESSOR: We'll see.,00:13:33.500,00:13:34.470
"But once you know what
the decisions are,",00:13:34.470,00:13:36.040
"then you have to think, what
do I need to make a decision?",00:13:36.040,00:13:38.456
AUDIENCE: The note.,00:13:41.680,00:13:43.650
"PROFESSOR: So, a
note is one of these.",00:13:43.650,00:13:51.840
"For some reason,
they're called notes.",00:13:51.840,00:13:54.000
"AUDIENCE: So you
know that somehow you",00:13:58.717,00:14:00.300
have to hit all of them?,00:14:00.300,00:14:01.950
"Like, you can have
steps in between.",00:14:01.950,00:14:05.116
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:14:05.116,00:14:05.740
AUDIENCE: Moves in between.,00:14:05.740,00:14:06.864
You have to hit all of them.,00:14:06.864,00:14:08.480
"PROFESSOR: OK, so I like this.",00:14:08.480,00:14:10.420
"So, every one of these is going
to have to generate a move.",00:14:10.420,00:14:15.640
"And there might be
some moves in between.",00:14:15.640,00:14:17.430
"Well, each move is going
to map to some edge.",00:14:24.650,00:14:26.950
And I'm going to need vertices.,00:14:26.950,00:14:29.160
"So, as an algorithms program
where when I hear that, oh.",00:14:29.160,00:14:33.510
"I can have some moves in
between, I get really uneasy.",00:14:33.510,00:14:36.040
"Like, what is this?",00:14:36.040,00:14:37.424
"How many moves am
I going to have?",00:14:37.424,00:14:38.840
"Is this going to
become really huge?",00:14:38.840,00:14:40.340
"And am I not going to be able
to run any algorithm on it?",00:14:40.340,00:14:43.950
So let's think about that.,00:14:43.950,00:14:45.200
"How many moves would
I have in between?",00:14:45.200,00:14:46.910
"And, what would I
achieve with them?",00:14:46.910,00:14:48.409
"AUDIENCE: I guess you'd have
a max of, like, four, right?",00:14:52.520,00:14:55.760
"I mean, you can put your
right leg someplace,",00:14:55.760,00:14:58.584
"and you can put your
left leg someplace.",00:14:58.584,00:15:00.250
That's like a max of two.,00:15:00.250,00:15:02.870
Right?,00:15:02.870,00:15:03.370
Or no?,00:15:03.370,00:15:04.350
"PROFESSOR: So, let's
think of an example.",00:15:04.350,00:15:07.350
"You want to go, say,
I want to go, what?",00:15:07.350,00:15:10.670
"From here to here, right?",00:15:10.670,00:15:12.930
AUDIENCE: Um-hmm.,00:15:12.930,00:15:13.980
"PROFESSOR: And
you're thinking what?",00:15:13.980,00:15:17.110
"They can do this, oh sorry.",00:15:17.110,00:15:19.750
So I can do this as one move.,00:15:19.750,00:15:21.430
And this is one move.,00:15:21.430,00:15:22.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:15:22.420,00:15:22.548
"Or you can just do
one jump, right?",00:15:22.548,00:15:24.236
"So it's-- oh, yeah.",00:15:24.236,00:15:25.645
I guess that's more than one.,00:15:25.645,00:15:27.570
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:15:27.570,00:15:29.090
"So looking at this,
if I'm considering",00:15:29.090,00:15:31.660
whether to go from here to here.,00:15:31.660,00:15:35.240
"If I want to go either this way,
or if I want to go this way.",00:15:35.240,00:15:41.387
"So let's write this
down on the board.",00:15:41.387,00:15:42.970
"So I'm going from up
down to left right.",00:15:46.150,00:15:54.050
"And I'm considering, do
I want to go directly",00:15:54.050,00:15:56.120
"or do I want to
go up right first.",00:15:56.120,00:16:01.690
And then left right.,00:16:01.690,00:16:04.980
"Let's not do these arrows
because they're confusing.",00:16:04.980,00:16:07.980
"So, do I want to
transition like this?",00:16:07.980,00:16:10.060
"Or do I want to
transition like this?",00:16:10.060,00:16:12.990
"Well, I claim that, since
my moves are independent,",00:16:12.990,00:16:19.700
"going from here to here,
if it's beneficial to go",00:16:19.700,00:16:23.990
"this way instead of
this way, I would",00:16:23.990,00:16:25.990
"want to go this
way all the time.",00:16:25.990,00:16:28.070
"So I would just say that, look.",00:16:28.070,00:16:30.330
"Inside my delta here, I
would say that, actually,",00:16:30.330,00:16:32.372
"if you know what you're
doing, whenever you have",00:16:32.372,00:16:34.371
"to go from here to here,
you're going to go like this.",00:16:34.371,00:16:36.780
"And the delta is going to report
to the total delta for this.",00:16:36.780,00:16:39.650
"So, if the problem is
that they have one note,",00:16:43.700,00:16:49.150
"and then I have my next note
like this, between these two",00:16:49.150,00:16:52.550
"notes, I can always
go in one move.",00:16:52.550,00:16:55.610
"AUDIENCE: So you're
saying 1 would",00:16:58.544,00:16:59.960
"like, including in our
difficulty function,",00:16:59.960,00:17:03.550
"it'll also tell
us, like, what move",00:17:03.550,00:17:06.150
we should make to get there?,00:17:06.150,00:17:07.900
PROFESSOR: How to get there.,00:17:07.900,00:17:09.300
"The best way to get from
one state to another.",00:17:09.300,00:17:11.270
"Well, like when
you're learning DDR,",00:17:11.270,00:17:12.770
"these are the
basic steps, right?",00:17:12.770,00:17:14.990
"Like, you practice until you
know how to get from one place",00:17:14.990,00:17:17.680
to another.,00:17:17.680,00:17:19.410
"There is something else where
you need intermediate steps.",00:17:19.410,00:17:21.960
"AUDIENCE: Or if
you're holding one",00:17:26.218,00:17:27.634
"and then you've got
to move to another.",00:17:27.634,00:17:30.685
Right?,00:17:30.685,00:17:31.185
"PROFESSOR: So, let's
not worry about holds.",00:17:35.019,00:17:36.810
"Let's say that we
would just represent",00:17:36.810,00:17:38.393
"holds as-- so if you have
a hold in a game, then",00:17:38.393,00:17:43.390
"we're just going to
represent it like this.",00:17:43.390,00:17:45.370
We're going to cheat.,00:17:45.370,00:17:46.244
"So we don't have
to deal with it.",00:17:49.290,00:17:50.946
"In real life, you would
have to deal with it.",00:17:50.946,00:17:52.820
"Like if you're actually writing
a program that trains people.",00:17:52.820,00:17:55.361
"AUDIENCE: What happens if you
have, like, right, left, up",00:17:55.361,00:17:59.970
or something.,00:17:59.970,00:18:00.780
"So let's say you start off
hitting your right foot",00:18:00.780,00:18:04.200
"on the top, and then you have
to hit the right one again.",00:18:04.200,00:18:10.836
"And then you have
to hit up again",00:18:10.836,00:18:12.420
and then you have to transfer.,00:18:12.420,00:18:13.670
"So I guess anytime you
have to through the middle.",00:18:13.670,00:18:17.700
You have move your foot.,00:18:17.700,00:18:19.700
"PROFESSOR: So I like the idea
of going through the middle.",00:18:19.700,00:18:23.540
"Why or how do you, why would
you go through the middle?",00:18:23.540,00:18:27.954
"AUDIENCE: To avoid crossing
your leg over or something.",00:18:27.954,00:18:32.099
"PROFESSOR: Well, what if I
have something like this?",00:18:32.099,00:18:34.265
"If there are DDR experts, I
know this isn't the right way",00:18:37.791,00:18:40.540
to do it.,00:18:40.540,00:18:41.040
"But one way of doing it is
left, right, left, right, left,",00:18:41.040,00:18:49.595
right.,00:18:49.595,00:18:51.640
"So then, I have some states
that account for the fact",00:18:51.640,00:18:53.950
that I'm centering.,00:18:53.950,00:18:54.741
"So, some people like
to do this, right?",00:18:57.420,00:18:59.080
"Some people like to go to the
center as much as possible,",00:18:59.080,00:19:02.070
"if they have time
between the moves.",00:19:02.070,00:19:04.500
"So then, I would need
at least one state",00:19:04.500,00:19:07.060
"in between where I'm
allowed to center, right?",00:19:07.060,00:19:11.167
"In order to represent
what I just did there,",00:19:11.167,00:19:13.000
I need one move.,00:19:13.000,00:19:14.570
"So, one way I could meet
this is I have left center.",00:19:21.490,00:19:24.610
And then left right.,00:19:24.610,00:19:26.980
"And then left right,
left right, left right.",00:19:26.980,00:19:30.729
So on and so forth.,00:19:30.729,00:19:31.520
"But this would mean that
instead of doing this, which",00:19:31.520,00:19:35.160
"is reasonably easy, I
would have to do this.",00:19:35.160,00:19:38.091
This.,00:19:38.091,00:19:38.590
"And then jump, jump,
jump, jump every time.",00:19:38.590,00:19:40.940
Harder.,00:19:40.940,00:19:41.900
Not good.,00:19:41.900,00:19:42.930
Not good for my knees.,00:19:42.930,00:19:43.870
Not good for my score.,00:19:43.870,00:19:45.196
So I don't want to do this.,00:19:45.196,00:19:46.320
"I want to have an intermediate
state so I can say,",00:19:46.320,00:19:50.200
"I start here and
then I get back here.",00:19:50.200,00:19:53.340
Then I do this.,00:19:53.340,00:19:55.540
Then I get back here.,00:19:55.540,00:19:56.610
Then I go here.,00:19:56.610,00:19:59.690
And then I go back here.,00:19:59.690,00:20:02.630
And then go back.,00:20:02.630,00:20:03.510
Do guys see how this works?,00:20:03.510,00:20:06.131
"AUDIENCE: You could
also rock back and forth",00:20:06.131,00:20:07.964
"to because they don't require
both feet to be on the ground",00:20:07.964,00:20:10.882
the entire time.,00:20:10.882,00:20:12.269
PROFESSOR: Rock back and forth.,00:20:12.269,00:20:13.560
Hold that thought.,00:20:13.560,00:20:14.309
That might come in handy.,00:20:17.169,00:20:18.210
Assuming we have enough time.,00:20:18.210,00:20:20.270
"So, if we only do one move
every time we see a note,",00:20:20.270,00:20:23.550
we're stuck with this.,00:20:23.550,00:20:25.720
"In our to allow
re-centering, we have",00:20:25.720,00:20:28.180
to add states between the notes.,00:20:28.180,00:20:32.550
"We need to add an
intermediary state.",00:20:32.550,00:20:35.210
"And you can either think about
it, or take my word for it,",00:20:35.210,00:20:39.530
"but if you represent the notes
using the trick that I said",00:20:39.530,00:20:43.570
"above, and you want to represent
centering, then all you need",00:20:43.570,00:20:47.460
is one extra state.,00:20:47.460,00:20:49.070
"So one extra move
between every two states.",00:20:49.070,00:20:50.960
Between two notes.,00:20:56.340,00:20:57.210
And that's enough.,00:21:00.320,00:21:01.070
"Because that one extra
state allows you to center.",00:21:01.070,00:21:03.270
"And it allows you to do pretty
much everything a beginner",00:21:03.270,00:21:06.610
like me would know how to do.,00:21:06.610,00:21:10.170
"AUDIENCE: So you only need one
extra state between each note?",00:21:10.170,00:21:13.876
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:21:13.876,00:21:14.500
That is the inside.,00:21:14.500,00:21:16.690
"That is where I'm
thinking, right?",00:21:16.690,00:21:18.840
"So I have to do both
this trick, to see",00:21:18.840,00:21:22.490
"that I don't need an
infinite number of steps.",00:21:22.490,00:21:25.300
"And come up with the
need for centering",00:21:25.300,00:21:28.320
"to see why I need one
intermediate step.",00:21:28.320,00:21:30.291
"By the way, does
anyone know what's",00:21:33.492,00:21:34.950
the right way of doing that?,00:21:34.950,00:21:36.594
"What's the right way
of doing this move?",00:21:36.594,00:21:38.260
"You said, rock back and forth.",00:21:41.510,00:21:42.780
"So I wouldn't rock back and
forth in this case, right?",00:21:42.780,00:21:44.860
"Because that
wouldn't be helpful.",00:21:44.860,00:21:45.940
How would I rock?,00:21:45.940,00:21:46.648
"AUDIENCE: Well,
you hold down one",00:21:46.648,00:21:48.156
"and then you go
to the other one.",00:21:48.156,00:21:49.530
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
rock left and right.",00:21:49.530,00:21:51.730
OK.,00:21:51.730,00:21:52.338
"AUDIENCE: I said back and
forth, I meant rocking--",00:21:52.338,00:21:54.530
PROFESSOR: Sorry.,00:21:54.530,00:21:55.238
"I thought back, forth.",00:21:55.238,00:21:57.170
"So, the optimal
way of doing this",00:21:57.170,00:21:59.090
"is left, right, left,
right, left, right.",00:21:59.090,00:22:04.690
So what am I doing?,00:22:04.690,00:22:06.497
AUDIENCE: You have another move.,00:22:06.497,00:22:07.830
"You have, like, one
state for your foot where",00:22:11.281,00:22:15.460
it's not touching the ground.,00:22:15.460,00:22:17.400
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:22:17.400,00:22:18.110
"It's an interesting, and
important, distinction.",00:22:18.110,00:22:20.160
"So if I wanted to hit
both of them, if I'm here,",00:22:20.160,00:22:22.160
"and I need to hit both of
them, I need to hit them.",00:22:22.160,00:22:25.200
"If I only need to hit
one of them, if I'm here,",00:22:25.200,00:22:27.770
I can hit it like this.,00:22:27.770,00:22:29.430
"If I'm here, though,
and I want to hit it,",00:22:29.430,00:22:31.180
I have to lift myself up.,00:22:31.180,00:22:34.659
"So the difference is
whether I'm like this.",00:22:34.659,00:22:36.450
Or like this.,00:22:36.450,00:22:37.409
Where is my weight?,00:22:37.409,00:22:38.200
"So if I want to allow
for these moves,",00:22:42.690,00:22:44.860
"if I want to go past the
stage of very beginner,",00:22:44.860,00:22:47.800
"aside from keeping track
of where my feet are,",00:22:47.800,00:22:50.190
"I have to keep track of whether
my weight is on my left foot",00:22:50.190,00:22:52.750
or on my right foot.,00:22:52.750,00:22:54.920
"So, I would actually
have l, r, and W,",00:22:54.920,00:22:58.570
where W is either l or r.,00:22:58.570,00:23:01.210
"AUDIENCE: So your state now
has what you're currently",00:23:07.138,00:23:11.265
putting more weight on.,00:23:11.265,00:23:13.810
"PROFESSOR: And where
each of the feet are.",00:23:13.810,00:23:15.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:23:15.770,00:23:16.660
Where your two feet are.,00:23:16.660,00:23:18.890
"And then also, the
song difficulty.",00:23:18.890,00:23:22.146
"So it's everything
in your state, right?",00:23:22.146,00:23:24.070
"PROFESSOR: Ah, yes.",00:23:24.070,00:23:25.470
I didn't think about it.,00:23:25.470,00:23:26.470
"I was just talking
about foot position.",00:23:26.470,00:23:28.159
"But we need to get back
to the state thing.",00:23:28.159,00:23:29.950
So that's a good point.,00:23:29.950,00:23:31.270
"So before we get to that, how
many feet positions do we have?",00:23:31.270,00:23:35.360
"If we don't include where
do I have my weight,",00:23:35.360,00:23:39.610
"how many possible positions
for both of my feet do I have?",00:23:39.610,00:23:42.230
So I have two feet.,00:23:47.350,00:23:48.370
"Each of them can be in any
of these five squares, right?",00:23:48.370,00:23:51.910
So how many total positions?,00:23:51.910,00:23:54.043
AUDIENCE: 5 choose 2.,00:23:54.043,00:23:57.256
Using 2.,00:23:57.256,00:23:58.620
PROFESSOR: So I can do this.,00:23:58.620,00:24:00.358
AUDIENCE: Sure.,00:24:00.358,00:24:00.983
Why not?,00:24:00.983,00:24:02.340
"PROFESSOR: Well, if I have
5 choose 2, then you--",00:24:02.340,00:24:04.616
"AUDIENCE: Oh, then that
doesn't quite work.",00:24:04.616,00:24:05.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:24:05.430,00:24:06.096
"AUDIENCE: Yeah, no.",00:24:06.096,00:24:07.820
PROFESSOR: So flip.,00:24:07.820,00:24:12.978
AUDIENCE: Times 2.,00:24:12.978,00:24:13.734
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:24:13.734,00:24:14.400
So you have two feet.,00:24:14.400,00:24:15.980
"Each foot, five possibilities.",00:24:15.980,00:24:17.260
"Now, what if we have weight?",00:24:21.520,00:24:23.110
"If we are tracking on
where I keep my weight.",00:24:23.110,00:24:25.670
How many possible positions?,00:24:25.670,00:24:27.275
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?,00:24:31.006,00:24:31.970
"Oh no, because there's only two.",00:24:31.970,00:24:34.480
"PROFESSOR: So,
for each of these,",00:24:34.480,00:24:36.700
there's two possibilities now.,00:24:36.700,00:24:38.470
So 50.,00:24:38.470,00:24:39.370
"AUDIENCE: You also have to be
so your weight is like this.",00:24:39.370,00:24:41.170
PROFESSOR: In the middle?,00:24:41.170,00:24:41.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:24:41.880,00:24:42.820
PROFESSOR: You can.,00:24:42.820,00:24:44.287
"Based on that what I've been
reading, you never want to.",00:24:44.287,00:24:46.620
"Because if you're
weight is in the middle,",00:24:46.620,00:24:48.370
"then you're extending a lot
of effort to move either foot.",00:24:48.370,00:24:53.229
"So you always want to have
your weight somewhere.",00:24:53.229,00:24:55.270
"So that, at least
for one of your feet,",00:24:55.270,00:24:56.895
it's easy to move it.,00:24:56.895,00:24:58.849
AUDIENCE: Could it be the back?,00:24:58.849,00:25:00.582
"PROFESSOR: If that's
not true, then yeah.",00:25:00.582,00:25:02.290
We'd need to have a center.,00:25:02.290,00:25:04.569
"Oh, so, like, whether I'm
like this or like this?",00:25:04.569,00:25:06.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:25:06.610,00:25:06.852
"If you were, like,
doing the same thing.",00:25:06.852,00:25:08.554
Rocking back and forth.,00:25:08.554,00:25:09.530
"PROFESSOR: So, if
I have two feet,",00:25:09.530,00:25:10.946
"then this says my weight
is on my left foot.",00:25:10.946,00:25:13.100
My weight is on my right foot.,00:25:13.100,00:25:15.070
"So l and r is which foot,
not where on the board.",00:25:15.070,00:25:20.070
"AUDIENCE: So, did you not do
center because it was optimal?",00:25:20.070,00:25:22.900
"PROFESSOR: Because I claim
that, in an optimal strategy,",00:25:22.900,00:25:25.250
you wouldn't have it.,00:25:25.250,00:25:26.240
"But you don't have to
take my word for it.",00:25:26.240,00:25:28.060
"If you don't believe
me, then you add center.",00:25:28.060,00:25:30.060
"And you just have
more possibilities.",00:25:30.060,00:25:32.110
"And if it happens to
not be an optimal thing,",00:25:32.110,00:25:34.220
"then the dynamic
programming will ignore it.",00:25:34.220,00:25:37.260
"So how many positions do
I have if I add center?",00:25:37.260,00:25:40.860
"So if I have left, center,
right for each position.",00:25:40.860,00:25:44.099
AUDIENCE: 75.,00:25:44.099,00:25:44.640
PROFESSOR: Cool.,00:25:47.140,00:25:47.806
Yes.,00:25:50.640,00:25:51.395
AUDIENCE: So why is it 25?,00:25:51.395,00:25:53.453
"You wouldn't actually have
both of your feet on the right.",00:25:53.453,00:25:56.945
PROFESSOR: Why?,00:25:56.945,00:25:57.570
"Maybe, well especially, for
maximizing this one actually.",00:26:00.430,00:26:03.720
"Especially for
maximizing entertainment.",00:26:03.720,00:26:06.800
"Then it's way cooler
to do this, right?",00:26:06.800,00:26:10.515
[LAUGHTER],00:26:10.515,00:26:12.830
You get the point.,00:26:12.830,00:26:13.580
AUDIENCE: --possible weight.,00:26:13.580,00:26:14.746
"Like combinations
for like, where is",00:26:14.746,00:26:16.757
"you should have your
feet at one time.",00:26:16.757,00:26:18.340
"Like, not necessarily what
the game is asking you to do.",00:26:18.340,00:26:20.764
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:26:20.764,00:26:21.430
So this is where my feet are.,00:26:21.430,00:26:25.040
"The game will always
ask something like this.",00:26:25.040,00:26:26.964
"So the game won't always
care about both of my feet.",00:26:26.964,00:26:29.130
"Sometimes it'll only
care about one foot.",00:26:29.130,00:26:30.930
"So, yeah.",00:26:33.241,00:26:33.740
"There are two different
concepts, right?",00:26:33.740,00:26:35.406
There's the position of my feet.,00:26:35.406,00:26:37.900
"And then there's the
note on the screen.",00:26:37.900,00:26:40.479
"And my feet have to match
the note on the screen.",00:26:40.479,00:26:42.520
"And we'll have to
capture that somehow.",00:26:42.520,00:26:45.500
So what's in a state?,00:26:45.500,00:26:48.370
What are my decisions?,00:26:48.370,00:26:50.169
"Come on, now.",00:26:50.169,00:26:50.710
"We should be in a good shape
to know what my decisions are.",00:26:50.710,00:26:53.780
What do I decide every time?,00:26:53.780,00:26:54.990
AUDIENCE: What move to make?,00:26:57.906,00:27:00.034
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:27:00.034,00:27:00.700
"How am I going to jump, right?",00:27:00.700,00:27:01.950
"Where my feet are going
to be in the new position.",00:27:01.950,00:27:05.510
"So every time, I'm deciding
what's the new foot position.",00:27:05.510,00:27:12.570
"AUDIENCE: Aren't you also
deciding weight position,",00:27:12.570,00:27:14.810
"where you're going
to hold to, right?",00:27:14.810,00:27:17.157
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:27:17.157,00:27:17.740
"So when I say foot position,
it's a cheat for everything.",00:27:17.740,00:27:21.240
So yeah.,00:27:24.380,00:27:24.880
Good observation.,00:27:24.880,00:27:27.650
OK.,00:27:27.650,00:27:29.560
"What do I need to know, in
order to make this decision?",00:27:29.560,00:27:33.680
OK.,00:27:38.030,00:27:39.450
"I would need to know
where I was before",00:27:39.450,00:27:41.450
"if I want to compute
the difficulties.",00:27:41.450,00:27:43.620
But aside from that-- what?,00:27:43.620,00:27:45.750
"AUDIENCE: Sir, it came
up with this polynomial.",00:27:45.750,00:27:48.540
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:27:48.540,00:27:50.450
"AUDIENCE: Is that a hint to what
the run time of this will be?",00:27:50.450,00:27:53.899
PROFESSOR: It's not on purpose.,00:27:53.899,00:27:55.190
But yes.,00:27:55.190,00:27:57.600
"So, yeah.",00:27:57.600,00:27:58.950
That makes sense.,00:27:58.950,00:27:59.730
Probably not good.,00:27:59.730,00:28:00.220
"I should probably not have
my screen up without me",00:28:00.220,00:28:02.303
looking at it.,00:28:02.303,00:28:04.570
"OK, so.",00:28:04.570,00:28:05.510
Back to decisions.,00:28:05.510,00:28:07.720
"I think I want to know what's
going to be on the screen",00:28:07.720,00:28:10.530
"when I land, right?",00:28:10.530,00:28:11.350
"Because if the screen says,
yo, you need to go up and down.",00:28:11.350,00:28:15.120
"Then maybe I shouldn't
do this, right?",00:28:15.120,00:28:17.872
That would not be good.,00:28:17.872,00:28:18.830
"So I need to know what the note
is going to be when I land.",00:28:21.620,00:28:24.460
Note.,00:28:27.131,00:28:27.630
"AUDIENCE: Is that
the same as the next?",00:28:31.318,00:28:33.725
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:28:33.725,00:28:34.350
Next note.,00:28:34.350,00:28:35.360
Yes.,00:28:35.360,00:28:36.480
"So the next note
here on the screen.",00:28:36.480,00:28:39.050
"So, my position in
this list, basically.",00:28:39.050,00:28:42.880
"AUDIENCE: So it's kind of like
the knapsack problem, where",00:28:42.880,00:28:45.296
"it's like which thing we're
considering picking up.",00:28:45.296,00:28:48.005
"But in this case, it's
coming [INAUDIBLE].",00:28:48.005,00:28:51.470
"PROFESSOR: So it's
close to knapsack.",00:28:51.470,00:28:53.720
"But the difference
is, in knapsack, I",00:28:53.720,00:28:56.970
"have to decide, do I choose
this or do I ignore it.",00:28:56.970,00:29:02.680
"So, if I'd be like, if I
can only do a few things",00:29:02.680,00:29:11.779
"and I want to maximize
my score, then",00:29:11.779,00:29:13.320
"maybe I would choose, all right.",00:29:13.320,00:29:14.870
This is easy.,00:29:14.870,00:29:15.450
I'm going to do it.,00:29:15.450,00:29:16.241
This is hard.,00:29:16.241,00:29:16.870
Screw it.,00:29:16.870,00:29:17.370
This is easy.,00:29:17.370,00:29:17.860
I'm going to do it.,00:29:17.860,00:29:18.651
"So then my decisions are 0, 1.",00:29:18.651,00:29:20.780
Pick or not pick.,00:29:20.780,00:29:22.610
"In this case, every
time my decision",00:29:22.610,00:29:24.520
is a new state of my feet.,00:29:24.520,00:29:25.870
"So it's not 0, 1.",00:29:25.870,00:29:27.046
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:29:27.046,00:29:27.860
"PROFESSOR: That's
the difference.",00:29:27.860,00:29:29.260
"And then, because
of that, the state",00:29:29.260,00:29:31.310
is going to look different.,00:29:31.310,00:29:32.570
"And the recursion's will
look a bit different.",00:29:32.570,00:29:34.520
OK.,00:29:40.740,00:29:41.240
"So I want to know the
note that I'm landing at.",00:29:41.240,00:29:43.710
"I want to know
the sum of-- well,",00:29:43.710,00:29:46.845
"we'll see if I want to know
the sum of difficulties",00:29:46.845,00:29:48.970
up to this point.,00:29:48.970,00:29:50.230
"And I want to know
one more thing, so.",00:29:50.230,00:29:53.730
"If this is going
to be my new state,",00:29:53.730,00:29:56.310
"and I know what note I'm landing
at, I'm making a decision.",00:29:56.310,00:30:00.900
"The decision tells me where
my feet are going to be.",00:30:00.900,00:30:04.240
Right?,00:30:07.320,00:30:07.820
"The move decides where
my feet are going to be.",00:30:07.820,00:30:10.390
What do I need to do?,00:30:10.390,00:30:12.640
"What else do I need to
know for my total solution?",00:30:12.640,00:30:16.672
"So what do I need to know to
consider between decisions?",00:30:16.672,00:30:19.005
"So say I'm considering the
state of-- I'm at note two.",00:30:24.500,00:30:31.290
"Note two says, left right.",00:30:31.290,00:30:35.750
"And I'm considering
of coming here",00:30:35.750,00:30:38.790
"from note one, where my
foot position was up down.",00:30:38.790,00:30:44.700
"Or come here from
note one, where",00:30:44.700,00:30:48.510
my foot position was left right.,00:30:48.510,00:30:52.270
"I need to know where
my foot position was,",00:30:57.671,00:30:59.420
"to choose between these, right?",00:30:59.420,00:31:01.650
"If I don't know that,
then I can't choose.",00:31:01.650,00:31:03.795
"AUDIENCE: That's not
from your state, though?",00:31:03.795,00:31:06.170
PROFESSOR: Not yet.,00:31:06.170,00:31:07.115
"It's not here, so it's
not part of my state.",00:31:07.115,00:31:09.010
"We've been talking about it a
lot, but we didn't put it here.",00:31:09.010,00:31:11.570
"So let's say that
the state is going",00:31:11.570,00:31:13.070
"to have the note
that I'm landing at.",00:31:13.070,00:31:14.640
"And my foot position
after landing.",00:31:14.640,00:31:18.550
"So, if I know that I'm
going to land like this,",00:31:28.130,00:31:33.100
"then I know where
I was here. l r.",00:31:33.100,00:31:35.530
"Say, l r.",00:31:35.530,00:31:37.920
"I can compute the
costs here, right?",00:31:37.920,00:31:39.650
"This is delta of going
from this to this.",00:31:39.650,00:31:47.010
"And this is the delta for
going from this to this.",00:31:47.010,00:31:53.641
Can you see?,00:31:53.641,00:31:54.540
Is that too small?,00:31:54.540,00:31:55.290
"Delta wants to know where
my feet were before.",00:31:59.600,00:32:02.210
"And where they're
going to be now.",00:32:02.210,00:32:03.910
"So when I call it, I need
to know where I was before.",00:32:03.910,00:32:06.290
"And I need to know where
I'm going to be now.",00:32:06.290,00:32:08.165
"So this should be
part of my state.",00:32:08.165,00:32:11.360
"So our decision says, what's
my new position going to be?",00:32:11.360,00:32:15.140
"So when I make a move, I
influence my new foot position.",00:32:15.140,00:32:18.610
"They're going to
be in someplace.",00:32:18.610,00:32:20.450
"And independently of that,
the note-- the position here--",00:32:20.450,00:32:25.242
"the position of the note,
increases all the time, right?",00:32:25.242,00:32:27.575
"Because time can
only go forwards.",00:32:27.575,00:32:28.991
"How are we going to account
for these extra moves?",00:32:32.910,00:32:35.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:32:38.689,00:32:40.824
"PROFESSOR: So, we said that
between every two notes,",00:32:40.824,00:32:42.990
"we might want to
make one extra move.",00:32:42.990,00:32:45.200
"AUDIENCE: Like, a
potential new note",00:32:50.840,00:32:53.092
"in between your
destination note?",00:32:53.092,00:32:56.610
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:32:56.610,00:32:57.442
"AUDIENCE: And then just fill
in the difficulties for that",00:32:57.442,00:33:00.385
and see which ones--,00:33:00.385,00:33:01.350
"PROFESSOR: So, if I want to use
the algorithm that I already",00:33:01.350,00:33:03.850
"have, that compares my
landing position to my note,",00:33:03.850,00:33:07.090
"to see whether I can go
there or not, what note would",00:33:07.090,00:33:10.470
"I want to put in that
intermediate note?",00:33:10.470,00:33:14.670
"So, you're basically saying
that between every two notes,",00:33:14.670,00:33:18.750
I'm going to have one more note.,00:33:18.750,00:33:20.560
"And my feet can
be wherever here.",00:33:20.560,00:33:24.903
AUDIENCE: Oh.,00:33:24.903,00:33:25.444
"I mean, you'll also
have the edge originally",00:33:25.444,00:33:28.228
connecting them.,00:33:28.228,00:33:30.550
"So, you'd have it going
to the intermediate note,",00:33:30.550,00:33:32.820
but also from the destination.,00:33:32.820,00:33:34.070
"Yeah, like that.",00:33:34.070,00:33:35.763
You'd have to--,00:33:35.763,00:33:38.070
"PROFESSOR: So, what
note would I have here?",00:33:38.070,00:33:42.630
"AUDIENCE: It makes
you go to the center.",00:33:42.630,00:33:44.556
"PROFESSOR: Do I have
to be at the center?",00:33:44.556,00:33:46.000
"AUDIENCE: Well, you
can be anywhere.",00:33:46.000,00:33:47.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:33:47.370,00:33:48.036
"So I'm going to
invent the blank note.",00:33:48.036,00:33:50.900
"That's a big O. That means
you can do whatever you want.",00:33:50.900,00:33:53.360
There are no constraints.,00:33:53.360,00:33:54.820
"So that is just an
intermediary state.",00:33:54.820,00:33:56.800
"So then I'm going
to take this input,",00:33:56.800,00:34:00.790
"and I'm going to add
these blank notes here.",00:34:00.790,00:34:03.710
"And these map to adding
notes in the graph.",00:34:03.710,00:34:05.690
"AUDIENCE: Well,
then, when you just",00:34:11.026,00:34:12.484
"run through your difficulty
function between each two notes",00:34:12.484,00:34:16.320
"and see if, for all the
potential moves, which",00:34:16.320,00:34:20.854
one minimizes that path.,00:34:20.854,00:34:23.656
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:34:23.656,00:34:25.060
"So basically, I'm assuming
I don't need this.",00:34:25.060,00:34:27.190
I'm assuming that.,00:34:27.190,00:34:30.065
"This is going to
be where there's",00:34:30.065,00:34:31.440
"at least one choice
where this is going",00:34:31.440,00:34:33.989
"to have the same cost
as a direct note.",00:34:33.989,00:34:37.377
"And then I'm going
to say that instead",00:34:37.377,00:34:38.960
"of having more complex
shapes in the graph,",00:34:38.960,00:34:42.260
"I'm going to insert
extra moves here.",00:34:42.260,00:34:46.138
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:34:46.138,00:34:46.679
"I would think that, if you
have an intermediate move that",00:34:46.679,00:34:49.053
"might be less expensive,
you should, like, just",00:34:49.053,00:34:52.570
"hop to that new
position than to have",00:34:52.570,00:34:54.411
"an intermediate move, right?",00:34:54.411,00:34:56.374
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:34:56.374,00:34:57.040
"And I'm going to assume that
either that's not the case,",00:34:57.040,00:35:00.375
"or that I can always find
an intermediate move that",00:35:00.375,00:35:02.500
makes my life better.,00:35:02.500,00:35:05.290
AUDIENCE: Every case?,00:35:05.290,00:35:06.564
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:35:06.564,00:35:07.230
"PROFESSOR: These
results do work.",00:35:12.786,00:35:14.255
"You'll have to take my word
for it that this works.",00:35:14.255,00:35:16.380
"And this makes your
dynamic programming easy.",00:35:16.380,00:35:18.860
"And it makes your
graph building easy.",00:35:18.860,00:35:21.500
"So the advantage of this is
you're changing the input.",00:35:21.500,00:35:24.370
"And then, when you're
building your graph",00:35:24.370,00:35:26.160
"or when you're doing
the DP, you only",00:35:26.160,00:35:28.000
"worry about an input
that looks like this.",00:35:28.000,00:35:30.430
"You don't care about
any intermediate stuff.",00:35:30.430,00:35:32.720
"You have notes, and you have to
transition between the notes.",00:35:32.720,00:35:35.270
Period.,00:35:35.270,00:35:36.240
"So we reduce the
complexity of the problem.",00:35:36.240,00:35:39.365
"So whenever you can get away
with that, it's really nice.",00:35:39.365,00:35:41.740
We can do that for centering.,00:35:41.740,00:35:43.970
"We might not be able to do
it for other more complicated",00:35:43.970,00:35:46.530
stuff.,00:35:46.530,00:35:47.029
OK.,00:35:50.360,00:35:52.990
"So, we sort of know
what we want in a state.",00:35:52.990,00:35:57.730
"Now we want to build a
graph, so that the path",00:35:57.730,00:36:00.950
"from some source
to some destination",00:36:00.950,00:36:05.140
"has a cost that's equivalent to
the sum of these difficulties.",00:36:05.140,00:36:10.970
Right?,00:36:10.970,00:36:11.470
"Because then I can
run the shortest path.",00:36:11.470,00:36:13.220
"And my solution
will be right there.",00:36:13.220,00:36:17.330
I know.,00:36:17.330,00:36:17.830
You guys seem awfully sad.,00:36:17.830,00:36:18.950
"Do you want to take a break
and play for a little bit more?",00:36:18.950,00:36:21.970
Yes?,00:36:21.970,00:36:24.790
"How many people want
to play, instead of.",00:36:24.790,00:36:28.797
You don't have to play yourself.,00:36:28.797,00:36:30.130
"You can just rest for
these two or three minutes.",00:36:30.130,00:36:32.720
"And you can watch
someone else play.",00:36:32.720,00:36:34.220
"And get more intuition about
how you're supposed to play.",00:36:34.220,00:36:37.311
OK.,00:36:39.741,00:36:40.240
"So one person wants
to take a break.",00:36:40.240,00:36:41.820
"Everyone else wants
to keep going?",00:36:41.820,00:36:43.110
"Or are you guys
passed out already?",00:36:43.110,00:36:44.440
AUDIENCE: Can we get out early?,00:36:44.440,00:36:45.731
PROFESSOR: Sort of.,00:36:48.370,00:36:49.920
Yeah.,00:36:49.920,00:36:50.420
"You'll get out
three minutes early,",00:36:50.420,00:36:51.878
if we don't do another round.,00:36:51.878,00:36:55.410
So who wants to keep going?,00:36:55.410,00:36:57.933
AUDIENCE: No.,00:36:57.933,00:36:58.474
Let's play.,00:36:58.474,00:37:01.057
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:37:01.057,00:37:01.640
So who wants to keep going?,00:37:01.640,00:37:02.765
You can only vote on one thing.,00:37:02.765,00:37:04.241
Who wants to play?,00:37:04.241,00:37:04.990
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:37:08.297,00:37:08.838
AUDIENCE: Five.,00:37:08.838,00:37:09.463
AUDIENCE: Four.,00:37:09.463,00:37:10.960
"AUDIENCE: Victor, go.",00:37:10.960,00:37:12.100
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:37:12.100,00:37:13.050
Who wants to go?,00:37:13.050,00:37:15.680
"So we decided what we're
going to have in notes.",00:37:15.680,00:37:18.330
"And we're going to
build a graph, where",00:37:18.330,00:37:20.730
the notes are the states.,00:37:20.730,00:37:22.200
And the edges are the moves.,00:37:22.200,00:37:23.830
Right?,00:37:23.830,00:37:25.630
"So a note tells me, just
like there, what note I'm at.",00:37:25.630,00:37:29.300
Say I'm at note two.,00:37:29.300,00:37:31.440
And where my feet are on.,00:37:31.440,00:37:34.440
"So, left foot left.",00:37:34.440,00:37:35.320
Right foot right.,00:37:35.320,00:37:36.290
"So, given a state, what
outgoing edges do I build?",00:37:38.820,00:37:42.270
Where can I go to?,00:37:42.270,00:37:43.950
"So let's say I have a state
that says I'm at note n",00:37:43.950,00:37:47.480
"and my left foot is
in some position.",00:37:47.480,00:37:49.320
"My right foot is
in some position.",00:37:49.320,00:37:53.000
"What are my outgoing
edges from here?",00:37:53.000,00:37:55.656
"AUDIENCE: Is there an
outgoing edge to every move?",00:37:55.656,00:37:58.340
Because there's a point.,00:37:58.340,00:37:59.497
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:37:59.497,00:38:00.080
"Well, actually, the
blank is a note, right?",00:38:03.869,00:38:05.660
"So if the next note, if
note three's a blank,",00:38:05.660,00:38:09.750
then the note is a blank.,00:38:09.750,00:38:11.610
And then I can have.,00:38:11.610,00:38:13.464
"AUDIENCE: I guess,
isn't the difficulty",00:38:13.464,00:38:16.470
"of the move dependent on what
note that blank actually is?",00:38:16.470,00:38:21.585
"PROFESSOR: So, it doesn't
depend on what the screen says.",00:38:21.585,00:38:23.960
It depends on where my feet are.,00:38:23.960,00:38:27.232
"AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.",00:38:27.232,00:38:27.940
I see.,00:38:27.940,00:38:28.464
"PROFESSOR: So I
have a number that",00:38:28.464,00:38:29.880
tells me what's on my screen.,00:38:29.880,00:38:31.690
"This number is
enough for me to know",00:38:31.690,00:38:33.980
"what's going to be on my screen
from now on until forever.",00:38:33.980,00:38:36.610
"Because I have the
list ahead of time.",00:38:36.610,00:38:39.080
"And then I have the
position of my feet.",00:38:39.080,00:38:41.010
"So these are both
part of the state.",00:38:41.010,00:38:43.300
"So I have notes
for all the notes.",00:38:43.300,00:38:45.310
"And all the positions
of the feet.",00:38:45.310,00:38:47.470
AUDIENCE: Right.,00:38:47.470,00:38:49.270
"But the blank note is
just one position of feet?",00:38:49.270,00:38:55.240
PROFESSOR: No.,00:38:55.240,00:38:56.010
"AUDIENCE: Or, it's
all positions.",00:38:56.010,00:38:57.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:38:57.120,00:38:57.320
"AUDIENCE: Isn't the
difficulty dependent",00:38:57.320,00:38:59.124
"on what position
your feet end up?",00:38:59.124,00:39:01.014
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:39:01.014,00:39:01.680
"So it's from where I
start to where I land.",00:39:01.680,00:39:03.690
"So, if I decide to start
from here, and go here,",00:39:03.690,00:39:14.030
"the difficulty of this move
is-- so it doesn't depend on",00:39:14.030,00:39:18.080
whether I have a blank there.,00:39:18.080,00:39:20.520
And this was OK.,00:39:20.520,00:39:21.450
"Or, if I had an up down,
then I just missed the note.",00:39:21.450,00:39:24.320
"But the difficulty, the effort
I'm expending, is the same.",00:39:24.320,00:39:27.120
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:39:27.120,00:39:28.120
"But if you start from that
other move and go to a different",00:39:28.120,00:39:31.120
"position, that's--",00:39:31.120,00:39:32.150
"PROFESSOR: If I go
from this to this,",00:39:32.150,00:39:34.060
"then that's a
different difficulty.",00:39:34.060,00:39:35.747
"AUDIENCE: But it still
could be a blank note?",00:39:35.747,00:39:38.609
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:39:38.609,00:39:39.570
"So, a blank note will let
me go wherever I want.",00:39:39.570,00:39:42.025
AUDIENCE: I see.,00:39:42.025,00:39:43.630
"But there are different kinds
of blank notes, with different--",00:39:43.630,00:39:49.098
"I guess I'm confused
as to what--",00:39:49.098,00:39:50.717
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:39:50.717,00:39:51.300
So let's go through them again.,00:39:51.300,00:39:52.591
"AUDIENCE: Is it kind of
like it's, like, spreading,",00:39:52.591,00:39:55.200
"so really when you
have your source note,",00:39:55.200,00:39:58.860
"it's actually connecting
to every possible move.",00:39:58.860,00:40:02.660
"And every possible move is
connecting to your next--",00:40:02.660,00:40:05.080
"so it's kind of like a
diamond shaped thing?",00:40:05.080,00:40:06.913
PROFESSOR: Not quite.,00:40:08.685,00:40:09.560
Not quite.,00:40:09.560,00:40:10.430
"So, let's go through
the notes again.",00:40:10.430,00:40:12.220
And then let's go through that.,00:40:12.220,00:40:13.730
"So the source move will be
connected to some notes.",00:40:13.730,00:40:16.030
"And then those notes will
be connected to other notes.",00:40:16.030,00:40:18.280
"And it looks more like you
have a big, outgoing degree.",00:40:18.280,00:40:21.490
Then you have a big network.,00:40:21.490,00:40:22.836
"Then the big, incoming degree.",00:40:22.836,00:40:24.085
"It looks like a messed
up sorting network.",00:40:24.085,00:40:27.082
"So, notes are constraints.",00:40:27.082,00:40:28.165
"This accepts any possible
feet combination, right?",00:40:31.050,00:40:34.230
So this accepts this.,00:40:34.230,00:40:38.830
"AUDIENCE: Is the
first combination",00:40:38.830,00:40:40.312
contained in that note?,00:40:40.312,00:40:42.782
In that blank note?,00:40:42.782,00:40:43.607
PROFESSOR: No.,00:40:43.607,00:40:44.190
The blank is a constraint.,00:40:44.190,00:40:45.273
"So, if I have a note that
looks like this, then",00:40:47.600,00:40:51.170
"if one of my feet is here and
the other one is in the center,",00:40:51.170,00:40:54.590
then that's fine.,00:40:54.590,00:40:55.750
The constraint is met.,00:40:55.750,00:40:57.517
"If one of my feet is up
and the other one is down,",00:40:57.517,00:40:59.600
then the constraint is met.,00:40:59.600,00:41:02.110
"AUDIENCE: But the edge
running into that blank note,",00:41:02.110,00:41:04.652
"depending on how your feet
land, is different difficulty.",00:41:04.652,00:41:09.976
Is that right?,00:41:09.976,00:41:10.944
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:41:10.944,00:41:12.410
"But when I compute
the edge width,",00:41:12.410,00:41:13.980
"I need to know where
I'm landing exactly.",00:41:13.980,00:41:16.590
"Not just where the note
is because the note might",00:41:16.590,00:41:18.770
admit multiple positions.,00:41:18.770,00:41:20.250
AUDIENCE: I see.,00:41:20.250,00:41:21.077
"PROFESSOR: So this guy
admits all positions.",00:41:21.077,00:41:22.910
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:41:22.910,00:41:23.940
"PROFESSOR: This guy admits
some positions, right?",00:41:23.940,00:41:26.050
"These are l r, l r.",00:41:26.050,00:41:28.140
"If I have up down, how many
feet positions does it admit?",00:41:28.140,00:41:33.150
AUDIENCE: Just one.,00:41:33.150,00:41:34.115
PROFESSOR: Not great.,00:41:34.115,00:41:34.990
AUDIENCE: No.,00:41:34.990,00:41:36.830
PROFESSOR: How many?,00:41:36.830,00:41:38.910
AUDIENCE: As an intermediate?,00:41:38.910,00:41:41.444
"PROFESSOR: If it's up down,
then it's on the screen.",00:41:41.444,00:41:43.610
My intermediates are all blank.,00:41:43.610,00:41:44.901
"AUDIENCE: Oh, oh.",00:41:44.901,00:41:45.654
"I thought you were
saying start with that.",00:41:45.654,00:41:47.844
PROFESSOR: So up down.,00:41:47.844,00:41:48.760
"If you see up down
on the screen,",00:41:48.760,00:41:50.135
how many feet positions?,00:41:50.135,00:41:51.360
"AUDIENCE: Left to right
what it could have.",00:41:51.360,00:41:52.640
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:41:52.640,00:41:53.420
"So, if the screen says up
down, the only two ways",00:41:53.420,00:41:56.210
I can do that is this.,00:41:56.210,00:41:58.740
Or this.,00:41:58.740,00:41:59.440
Right?,00:41:59.440,00:41:59.940
"So, two positions.",00:41:59.940,00:42:00.555
AUDIENCE: I see.,00:42:00.555,00:42:01.346
"AUDIENCE: Well, I mean, but
you could have intermediate",00:42:01.346,00:42:03.637
"where you step in the
first one, then back.",00:42:03.637,00:42:05.850
"PROFESSOR: But I don't
care because I've",00:42:05.850,00:42:07.890
added these blank notes.,00:42:07.890,00:42:09.120
"And they take care of
my intermediates for me.",00:42:09.120,00:42:11.200
"AUDIENCE: But so,
we're saying where",00:42:11.200,00:42:12.700
"the feet land aren't
part of the note.",00:42:12.700,00:42:17.804
PROFESSOR: Nope.,00:42:17.804,00:42:18.470
They're just states.,00:42:18.470,00:42:19.640
"So they're a
decision I'm making.",00:42:19.640,00:42:22.290
"AUDIENCE: So, do we
have the multiple-- no,",00:42:22.290,00:42:24.816
"we don't because they're
not part of the--",00:42:24.816,00:42:28.500
"PROFESSOR: For each
note position here,",00:42:34.760,00:42:37.620
"for every position
in the screen thing,",00:42:37.620,00:42:40.960
"I have multiple feet
positions that I could be in.",00:42:40.960,00:42:45.540
AUDIENCE: Right.,00:42:45.540,00:42:46.363
Right.,00:42:46.363,00:42:46.863
"But then, are there multiple
moves to get to those?",00:42:46.863,00:42:50.895
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:42:50.895,00:42:51.520
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:42:51.520,00:42:52.061
"So there's multiple
moves connecting each.",00:42:52.061,00:42:54.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:42:54.640,00:42:55.950
"So for example, if I want
to get to l r, up down here,",00:42:55.950,00:43:04.230
"I can go from l r,
up down in the blank.",00:43:04.230,00:43:09.360
"Or, I could have
l r be like this.",00:43:09.360,00:43:12.760
And then transition.,00:43:12.760,00:43:16.040
"So I can have a lot of
possible foot positions",00:43:16.040,00:43:20.450
"that I'm transitioning
from in order to get here.",00:43:20.450,00:43:24.970
"AUDIENCE: But those
aren't actually",00:43:24.970,00:43:27.640
separate notes on the graph.,00:43:27.640,00:43:29.837
PROFESSOR: They are.,00:43:29.837,00:43:30.670
They have to be.,00:43:30.670,00:43:33.620
"So these all have to
be separate notes.",00:43:33.620,00:43:36.260
"Because the edges are going
to have separate weights.",00:43:36.260,00:43:38.600
Right?,00:43:38.600,00:43:39.100
"This edge is going
to have one weight.",00:43:39.100,00:43:40.680
"This edge is going to
have another weight.",00:43:40.680,00:43:42.160
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:43:42.160,00:43:42.820
That's what I thought.,00:43:42.820,00:43:43.736
"But then you said there
was only one blank.",00:43:43.736,00:43:45.680
"Don't there have to be multiple
blank notes for every foot",00:43:51.999,00:43:54.912
thing.,00:43:54.912,00:43:55.610
"If you're approaching
a note from different--",00:43:55.610,00:43:57.485
"PROFESSOR: So, I'm not
sure what you're asking.",00:44:00.110,00:44:04.840
"So, if you want to
care about centering,",00:44:04.840,00:44:06.796
"if you want to have
intermediate moves,",00:44:06.796,00:44:08.420
"you need one blank note
between every real note.",00:44:08.420,00:44:12.060
"So that you're allowed to make
one intermediate move between.",00:44:12.060,00:44:16.122
AUDIENCE: Right.,00:44:16.122,00:44:16.788
"I get that that's talking
about the on the screen.",00:44:16.788,00:44:21.184
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:44:21.184,00:44:21.850
That's the screen.,00:44:21.850,00:44:22.520
AUDIENCE: That's the screen.,00:44:22.520,00:44:23.180
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:44:23.180,00:44:23.805
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:44:23.805,00:44:24.430
"So, that's not
the graph, though.",00:44:24.430,00:44:26.350
"Here, we're talking about
the screen on the graph.",00:44:26.350,00:44:28.760
"PROFESSOR: Here, we're
talking about the graph.",00:44:28.760,00:44:30.780
"So two tells me that the
screen is at note two.",00:44:30.780,00:44:34.540
Whatever that happens to be.,00:44:34.540,00:44:36.370
"And my feet are
in this position.",00:44:36.370,00:44:37.760
OK.,00:44:40.200,00:44:40.700
So that's very important.,00:44:40.700,00:44:42.450
"Thanks for asking because
that's very important.",00:44:42.450,00:44:44.560
"So, a state has the note
that I'm landing at.",00:44:44.560,00:44:47.350
"So, where the screen is.",00:44:47.350,00:44:48.650
And where my feet are.,00:44:48.650,00:44:50.185
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:44:50.185,00:44:51.497
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:44:51.497,00:44:52.080
"AUDIENCE: The state corresponds
to the nodes that you're on.",00:44:52.080,00:44:54.270
PROFESSOR: A note.,00:44:54.270,00:44:55.020
A note is a state.,00:44:55.020,00:44:56.940
"So, a note is a state.",00:44:56.940,00:44:58.230
"And a move goes
between two states.",00:44:58.230,00:45:01.071
"This is how we represent
all the graph problems.",00:45:01.071,00:45:03.070
OK.,00:45:05.880,00:45:08.050
"AUDIENCE: So, you
need multiple blank.",00:45:08.050,00:45:10.834
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:45:10.834,00:45:11.500
"So here, I'm just
drawing one example.",00:45:11.500,00:45:13.390
Yeah.,00:45:13.390,00:45:14.010
Yeah.,00:45:14.010,00:45:14.240
"So for example, here
I would need-- sorry.",00:45:14.240,00:45:16.000
"Oh, OK.",00:45:16.000,00:45:16.589
I get your confusion now.,00:45:16.589,00:45:17.630
"So, yeah.",00:45:17.630,00:45:18.129
This would be one move.,00:45:18.129,00:45:20.930
This would be another move.,00:45:20.930,00:45:24.210
"AUDIENCE: That's all for a
single thing on the screen.",00:45:24.210,00:45:26.796
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:45:26.796,00:45:27.420
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:45:27.420,00:45:28.286
OK.,00:45:28.286,00:45:28.785
That makes sense.,00:45:28.785,00:45:29.695
"AUDIENCE: So the next note
would have a really large end",00:45:29.695,00:45:32.028
"degree, right?",00:45:32.028,00:45:32.840
I guess they always have--,00:45:32.840,00:45:33.540
"AUDIENCE: Well, no.",00:45:33.540,00:45:34.100
It'd have lots of--,00:45:34.100,00:45:34.800
"PROFESSOR: So, this note
has a huge out degree.",00:45:34.800,00:45:36.385
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:45:36.385,00:45:37.010
"But I'm saying the ones that all
those intermediates connect to.",00:45:37.010,00:45:40.237
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:45:40.237,00:45:40.903
"AUDIENCE: So, then,
they would connect",00:45:40.903,00:45:42.030
"with some note that have,
like, really large degree.",00:45:42.030,00:45:43.801
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:45:43.801,00:45:44.284
"AUDIENCE: But there's two
of them after that, right?",00:45:44.284,00:45:46.450
"Because there would
be two different--",00:45:46.450,00:45:48.295
"PROFESSOR: So, what's next?",00:45:48.295,00:45:49.420
"Next, is position, hmm.",00:45:49.420,00:45:52.830
How did U number them?,00:45:52.830,00:45:54.210
"I guess, crap.",00:45:54.210,00:45:57.452
No.,00:46:03.111,00:46:03.610
"It's not going to
match that, so.",00:46:03.610,00:46:05.080
"Whatever we do, it's
not going to match that.",00:46:05.080,00:46:08.450
"Say the next note,
4, is just an up.",00:46:08.450,00:46:13.370
4 is up down.,00:46:18.930,00:46:19.890
"And then I have two
notes for it, right?",00:46:19.890,00:46:21.880
"Wild One note, l r.",00:46:21.880,00:46:22.800
So this is note 4.,00:46:26.130,00:46:27.830
That happens to be up down.,00:46:27.830,00:46:29.060
And then I have this.,00:46:29.060,00:46:32.270
"And every one of these
connects to every one of these.",00:46:32.270,00:46:40.767
"AUDIENCE: If the
next move is up down,",00:46:40.767,00:46:42.350
how can notes have down up?,00:46:42.350,00:46:43.561
"Oh, because you can
switch the feet.",00:46:43.561,00:46:45.060
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:46:45.060,00:46:45.556
AUDIENCE: Oh.,00:46:45.556,00:46:46.097
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:46:48.524,00:46:49.190
"So, I aimed to ask you guys, how
am I going to draw the edges?",00:46:49.190,00:46:51.773
"But you guys made me
do it with questions.",00:46:51.773,00:46:54.490
"So, suppose I met note n, l, r.",00:46:54.490,00:46:57.040
"What edges do I draw
going out of it?",00:46:57.040,00:46:59.760
"So, note n, left foot
at some position.",00:46:59.760,00:47:01.914
Right foot at some position.,00:47:01.914,00:47:03.080
What are my outgoing edges?,00:47:03.080,00:47:04.420
"AUDIENCE: This is a
note on the screen.",00:47:07.476,00:47:09.100
Or--,00:47:09.100,00:47:09.620
PROFESSOR: In the graph.,00:47:09.620,00:47:09.860
"AUDIENCE: --the new one
or intermediate one?",00:47:09.860,00:47:11.693
PROFESSOR: Doesn't matter.,00:47:11.693,00:47:12.850
"So, intermediate notes
have a note blank.",00:47:12.850,00:47:15.106
"AUDIENCE: That's
just everything.",00:47:15.106,00:47:16.480
PROFESSOR: It doesn't matter.,00:47:16.480,00:47:17.688
"Yeah, we're looking at all
of them at the same time.",00:47:17.688,00:47:20.720
"AUDIENCE: Wait, so
you're asking what are--",00:47:20.720,00:47:23.170
"PROFESSOR: So, given this note,
who am I connecting it to?",00:47:23.170,00:47:26.320
Let's draw the outgoing edges.,00:47:26.320,00:47:28.510
"So, if you're solving
this as a graph problem,",00:47:28.510,00:47:30.960
you build the notes.,00:47:30.960,00:47:31.860
You draw the edges.,00:47:31.860,00:47:32.990
You're on some algorithm.,00:47:32.990,00:47:34.471
So let's draw the edges.,00:47:34.471,00:47:35.470
"AUDIENCE: I think it depends
if you're an intermediate note",00:47:38.023,00:47:40.481
or not.,00:47:40.481,00:47:41.780
PROFESSOR: Nope.,00:47:41.780,00:47:42.600
"So the note tells you
what your constraints are.",00:47:42.600,00:47:45.190
"And that covers
intermediate notes.",00:47:45.190,00:47:48.830
"If you're note is a blank, then,
well, there's no constraints.",00:47:48.830,00:47:52.099
"If the note is not a blank,
then there are constraints.",00:47:52.099,00:47:54.390
"AUDIENCE: Oh, note.",00:47:54.390,00:47:54.639
"I thought that was referring
to the note, not the--",00:47:54.639,00:47:56.830
PROFESSOR: No.,00:47:56.830,00:47:57.413
So this is a note.,00:47:57.413,00:47:58.860
Maybe n is not good.,00:47:58.860,00:48:00.400
"Let's use i, instead, then.",00:48:00.400,00:48:03.702
If n is hard.,00:48:03.702,00:48:04.890
"So, i is the position
here, in this guy.",00:48:04.890,00:48:08.647
Right?,00:48:08.647,00:48:09.146
"Say for example,
i equals 1 here.",00:48:12.340,00:48:14.015
I equals 2 here.,00:48:14.015,00:48:15.090
I equals 3 here.,00:48:15.090,00:48:15.760
So and so forth.,00:48:15.760,00:48:17.270
"And that doesn't match this, so.",00:48:17.270,00:48:19.673
"AUDIENCE: We're
talking about note--",00:48:19.673,00:48:21.172
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:48:21.172,00:48:21.797
AUDIENCE: --not--,00:48:21.797,00:48:23.570
"PROFESSOR: If one
note is represented",00:48:23.570,00:48:25.260
"by these three numbers, right?",00:48:25.260,00:48:26.510
Each note has this tuple in it.,00:48:26.510,00:48:27.825
AUDIENCE: Then i is the note.,00:48:27.825,00:48:29.495
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:48:29.495,00:48:30.120
"AUDIENCE: So i
connects to i plus 1.",00:48:30.120,00:48:32.028
"And then all
possibilities known.",00:48:32.028,00:48:34.097
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:48:34.097,00:48:34.680
So this connects to i plus 1.,00:48:34.680,00:48:36.610
"And then all possible
destinations, right?",00:48:36.610,00:48:40.880
So I'm going to say left.,00:48:40.880,00:48:44.380
This is after the jump.,00:48:44.380,00:48:45.360
"So, left after the jump,
and right after the jump.",00:48:45.360,00:48:48.630
"And this is for all
possible left after a jump,",00:48:48.630,00:48:54.340
right after the jump.,00:48:54.340,00:48:55.710
And lost a weight on this edge.,00:48:55.710,00:49:02.780
"AUDIENCE: The way
that it's from--",00:49:02.780,00:49:05.940
AUDIENCE: l r to,00:49:05.940,00:49:06.728
AUDIENCE: --l r to l r.,00:49:06.728,00:49:08.997
AUDIENCE: l j-- l sub j r.,00:49:08.997,00:49:10.080
AUDIENCE: l r.,00:49:10.080,00:49:11.770
"PROFESSOR: So you want to
say from l r to l j, r j.",00:49:11.770,00:49:16.850
But what?,00:49:16.850,00:49:18.855
AUDIENCE: Difficulty level?,00:49:18.855,00:49:19.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:49:19.980,00:49:20.646
Where is that?,00:49:20.646,00:49:21.922
"AUDIENCE: Your
difficulty function.",00:49:21.922,00:49:23.380
PROFESSOR: Which is?,00:49:23.380,00:49:24.424
AUDIENCE: Delta.,00:49:24.424,00:49:25.090
PROFESSOR: Delta.,00:49:25.090,00:49:27.350
"So, yeah.",00:49:27.350,00:49:27.850
The weight is delta.,00:49:27.850,00:49:29.710
I drew d.,00:49:29.710,00:49:31.220
"Delta of these two
foot positions.",00:49:31.220,00:49:36.880
Almost.,00:49:36.880,00:49:37.660
"If I want to minimize the
difficulty, then this is right.",00:49:37.660,00:49:42.260
"If I want to maximize
a score, then I",00:49:42.260,00:49:44.040
would have to add a minus sign.,00:49:44.040,00:49:47.404
"But if you're minimizing
the difficulty,",00:49:47.404,00:49:49.070
"this is exactly the way because
it maps the shortest path.",00:49:49.070,00:49:51.520
"Usually, in dynamic programming,
things are maximized.",00:49:51.520,00:49:55.302
"AUDIENCE: Wait, why would
you add a minus if it's--",00:49:55.302,00:49:57.586
"PROFESSOR: So, if we're
maximizing something,",00:49:57.586,00:49:59.460
"we have to flip-- we have to
add a minus to the edge costs",00:49:59.460,00:50:02.165
because--,00:50:02.165,00:50:02.665
AUDIENCE: Right.,00:50:02.665,00:50:03.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:50:03.520,00:50:03.700
"But this time we're
minimizing something.",00:50:03.700,00:50:05.590
AUDIENCE: Oh.,00:50:05.590,00:50:05.802
"Right, right, right.",00:50:05.802,00:50:06.580
"PROFESSOR: I promised you
that we'll maximize something",00:50:06.580,00:50:08.260
all the time.,00:50:08.260,00:50:08.730
"Well, I guess I lied.",00:50:08.730,00:50:09.630
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:50:09.630,00:50:10.084
"Right, right, right.",00:50:10.084,00:50:10.538
"AUDIENCE: You don't
want to maximize d.",00:50:10.538,00:50:12.162
Then you're dead.,00:50:12.162,00:50:13.720
PROFESSOR: No.,00:50:13.720,00:50:14.439
You want to maximize show offs.,00:50:14.439,00:50:15.730
"So if we have the
entertainment thing,",00:50:15.730,00:50:17.090
then that would be maximized.,00:50:17.090,00:50:18.210
And then you'd have minus.,00:50:18.210,00:50:19.290
"AUDIENCE: Then you'd
have everything you need.",00:50:19.290,00:50:20.136
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:50:20.136,00:50:20.761
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:50:20.761,00:50:21.611
"PROFESSOR: OK, so
we're almost good.",00:50:21.611,00:50:23.110
"Source notes and
destination notes.",00:50:23.110,00:50:26.630
"AUDIENCE: Well, I
guess source, we",00:50:26.630,00:50:28.046
"know that means
start in the middle.",00:50:28.046,00:50:30.142
Right?,00:50:30.142,00:50:30.642
"Like, you would start off with--",00:50:30.642,00:50:33.720
PROFESSOR: What's the source?,00:50:33.720,00:50:35.329
"You want to start at
the first note, right?",00:50:35.329,00:50:37.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:50:37.120,00:50:38.510
"PROFESSOR: But in
which position?",00:50:38.510,00:50:40.581
"AUDIENCE: Well, in
the center, right?",00:50:40.581,00:50:42.265
"I mean, the [INAUDIBLE] start.",00:50:42.265,00:50:43.988
"Or, I guess you could start--",00:50:43.988,00:50:45.196
AUDIENCE: Wherever you want.,00:50:45.196,00:50:47.699
"AUDIENCE: Could you
add a source note",00:50:47.699,00:50:49.240
"going to a bunch of
intermediate notes?",00:50:49.240,00:50:51.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:50:51.060,00:50:52.180
Yeah.,00:50:52.180,00:50:52.680
"So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say there is a note 0.",00:50:52.680,00:50:56.510
"That let's me choose
how I'm going to start.",00:50:56.510,00:50:59.475
"AUDIENCE: Oh, it
could be any position.",00:50:59.475,00:51:01.100
"It's like an
intermediate note itself.",00:51:01.100,00:51:02.890
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:51:02.890,00:51:03.515
"So I'm going to have a note
0, with all possible foot",00:51:06.180,00:51:09.690
positions.,00:51:09.690,00:51:11.760
"And then this is going to
be connected to a source,",00:51:11.760,00:51:15.540
by edges of weight 0.,00:51:15.540,00:51:18.087
"So the intuition is that I get
to choose my starting position,",00:51:18.087,00:51:20.670
right?,00:51:20.670,00:51:21.710
Starting position.,00:51:21.710,00:51:23.360
I see the first note.,00:51:23.360,00:51:24.440
I make a move.,00:51:24.440,00:51:26.020
"So I want to be able to
choose the starting position.",00:51:26.020,00:51:28.280
"That's why I have
all those notes.",00:51:28.280,00:51:29.820
"And then make a move to
touch the first note.",00:51:29.820,00:51:32.370
"AUDIENCE: The starting
position is also a note.",00:51:35.842,00:51:38.322
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:51:38.322,00:51:39.820
"Because, if the
first note is here,",00:51:39.820,00:51:43.490
"I don't necessarily
want to start like this",00:51:43.490,00:51:45.500
"because maybe this
is harder than this.",00:51:45.500,00:51:47.820
All right.,00:51:52.295,00:51:52.795
What's the destination?,00:51:52.795,00:51:53.753
AUDIENCE: The last note.,00:51:56.898,00:51:58.400
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:51:58.400,00:51:59.930
"So, all the notes that are at
note n, and have any position,",00:51:59.930,00:52:04.790
"would be connected to
a destination note,",00:52:04.790,00:52:06.720
using an edge of weight 0.,00:52:06.720,00:52:09.660
"Or I can consider
them as destinations.",00:52:09.660,00:52:11.510
"And then choose the destination
that has the shortest path.",00:52:11.510,00:52:16.340
"AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.",00:52:16.340,00:52:18.580
"The final destination is
going to be, like, two notes.",00:52:18.580,00:52:23.320
Right?,00:52:23.320,00:52:23.820
"It's going to be that
last position, and then--",00:52:23.820,00:52:25.242
"PROFESSOR: Or it
might be more than two",00:52:25.242,00:52:26.866
"if the note is
just a simple note.",00:52:26.866,00:52:29.900
"Because that wouldn't
constrain my feet too much.",00:52:29.900,00:52:32.030
OK.,00:52:32.030,00:52:32.530
"And last, last question.",00:52:32.530,00:52:34.770
Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford?,00:52:34.770,00:52:36.382
"AUDIENCE: Bellman-Ford,
because you",00:52:36.382,00:52:37.840
"have negative edges,
negative weight,",00:52:37.840,00:52:41.235
"as if you were going
to maximize to death.",00:52:41.235,00:52:45.130
"PROFESSOR: So, this is always
going to be from 0 to 1.",00:52:45.130,00:52:48.060
"So I could possibly
use Dijkstra.",00:52:48.060,00:52:50.490
The answer is neither.,00:52:50.490,00:52:51.550
"The answer is, we're
building a DAG, so.",00:52:51.550,00:52:54.175
AUDIENCE: Dijkstra.,00:52:54.175,00:52:54.966
AUDIENCE: We don't use that.,00:52:54.966,00:52:56.730
"PROFESSOR: DAG, shortest path.",00:52:56.730,00:52:57.980
"Every time we have
dynamic programming, DAG,",00:52:57.980,00:53:00.350
shortest path.,00:53:00.350,00:53:02.820
OK?,00:53:02.820,00:53:03.320
AUDIENCE: Question.,00:53:03.320,00:53:04.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:53:04.240,00:53:05.160
"Come on, last question.",00:53:05.160,00:53:06.360
You can't get away that easily.,00:53:06.360,00:53:08.000
"OK, so.",00:53:08.000,00:53:08.550
Who wants to play?,00:53:08.550,00:53:10.400
