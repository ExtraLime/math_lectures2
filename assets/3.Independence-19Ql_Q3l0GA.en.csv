PROFESSOR: Let us start.,00:00:23.750,00:00:26.970
"So as always, we're to have
a quick review of what we",00:00:26.970,00:00:30.080
discussed last time.,00:00:30.080,00:00:31.240
"And then today we're going
to introduce just one new",00:00:31.240,00:00:34.240
"concept, the notion of
independence of two events.",00:00:34.240,00:00:38.120
"And we will play with
that concept.",00:00:38.120,00:00:41.030
"So what did we talk
about last time?",00:00:41.030,00:00:43.110
"The idea is that we have an
experiment, and the experiment",00:00:43.110,00:00:46.410
has a sample space omega.,00:00:46.410,00:00:48.800
"And then somebody comes and
tells us you know the outcome",00:00:48.800,00:00:52.300
"of the experiments happens to
lie inside this particular",00:00:52.300,00:00:56.840
"event B. Given this information,
it kind of",00:00:56.840,00:01:00.470
"changes what we know about
the situation.",00:01:00.470,00:01:03.070
"It tells us that the outcome
is going to be somewhere",00:01:03.070,00:01:05.510
inside here.,00:01:05.510,00:01:06.630
"So this is essentially
our new sample space.",00:01:06.630,00:01:09.800
"And now we need to we reassign
probabilities to the various",00:01:09.800,00:01:13.130
"possible outcomes, because, for
example, these outcomes,",00:01:13.130,00:01:16.550
"even if they had positive
probability beforehand, now",00:01:16.550,00:01:20.340
"that we're told that B occurred,
those outcomes out",00:01:20.340,00:01:22.890
"there are going to have
zero probability.",00:01:22.890,00:01:25.220
"So we need to revise
our probabilities.",00:01:25.220,00:01:27.670
"The new probabilities are
called conditional",00:01:27.670,00:01:29.740
"probabilities, and they're
defined this way.",00:01:29.740,00:01:33.390
"The conditional probability that
A occurs given that we're",00:01:33.390,00:01:37.000
"told that B occurred is
calculated by this formula,",00:01:37.000,00:01:40.670
which tells us the following--,00:01:40.670,00:01:42.880
"out of the total probability
that was initially assigned to",00:01:42.880,00:01:45.750
"the event B, what fraction of
that probability is assigned",00:01:45.750,00:01:49.760
"to outcomes that also
make A to happen?",00:01:49.760,00:01:54.310
"So out of the total probability
assigned to B, we",00:01:54.310,00:01:58.650
"see what fraction of that total
probability is assigned",00:01:58.650,00:02:03.080
"to those elements here that
will also make A happen.",00:02:03.080,00:02:06.650
"Conditional probabilities are
left undefined if the",00:02:06.650,00:02:09.360
denominator here is zero.,00:02:09.360,00:02:12.860
"An easy consequence of the
definition is if we bring that",00:02:12.860,00:02:16.030
"term to the other side, then we
can find the probability of",00:02:16.030,00:02:18.670
"two things happening by taking
the probability that the first",00:02:18.670,00:02:22.040
"thing happens, and then, given
that the first thing happened,",00:02:22.040,00:02:25.170
"the conditional probability that
the second one happens.",00:02:25.170,00:02:28.230
"Then we saw last time that we
can divide and conquer in",00:02:28.230,00:02:31.680
"calculating probabilities of
mildly complicated events by",00:02:31.680,00:02:36.010
"breaking it down into
different scenarios.",00:02:36.010,00:02:39.070
"So event B can happen
in two ways.",00:02:39.070,00:02:41.350
"It can happen either together
with A, which is this",00:02:41.350,00:02:44.810
"probability, or it can happen
together with A complement,",00:02:44.810,00:02:48.700
which is this probability.,00:02:48.700,00:02:49.880
"So basically what we're saying
that the total probability of",00:02:49.880,00:02:53.100
"B is the probability of this,
which is A intersection B,",00:02:53.100,00:02:57.960
"plus the probability of that,
which is A complement",00:02:57.960,00:03:02.620
intersection B.,00:03:02.620,00:03:07.530
"So these two facts here,
multiplication rule and the",00:03:07.530,00:03:11.355
"total probability theorem, are
basic tools that one uses to",00:03:11.355,00:03:14.760
"break down probability
calculations",00:03:14.760,00:03:16.990
into a simpler parts.,00:03:16.990,00:03:18.930
"So we find probabilities of
two things happening by",00:03:18.930,00:03:21.600
looking at each one at a time.,00:03:21.600,00:03:24.300
"And this is what we do to break
up a situation with two",00:03:24.300,00:03:27.830
different possible scenarios.,00:03:27.830,00:03:29.760
"Then we also have
the Bayes rule,",00:03:29.760,00:03:32.110
which does the following.,00:03:32.110,00:03:33.600
"Given a model that has
conditional probabilities of",00:03:33.600,00:03:36.640
"this kind, the Bayes rule
allows us to calculate",00:03:36.640,00:03:38.970
"conditional probabilities in
which the events appear in",00:03:38.970,00:03:41.570
different order.,00:03:41.570,00:03:43.020
"You can think of these
probabilities as describing a",00:03:43.020,00:03:45.740
"causal model of a certain
situation, whereas these are",00:03:45.740,00:03:49.270
"the probabilities that you get
after you do some inference",00:03:49.270,00:03:52.670
"based on the information that
you have available.",00:03:52.670,00:03:55.480
"Now the Bayes rule, we derived
it, and it's a trivial",00:03:55.480,00:03:59.200
half-line calculation.,00:03:59.200,00:04:01.040
"But it underlies lots
and lots of useful",00:04:01.040,00:04:03.670
things in the real world.,00:04:03.670,00:04:05.290
"We had the radar example
last time.",00:04:05.290,00:04:07.650
"You can think of more
complicated situations in",00:04:07.650,00:04:10.410
"which there's a bunch or lots of
different hypotheses about",00:04:10.410,00:04:14.570
the environment.,00:04:14.570,00:04:15.920
"Given any particular setting in
the environment, you have a",00:04:15.920,00:04:18.899
"measuring device that
can produce",00:04:18.899,00:04:21.140
many different outcomes.,00:04:21.140,00:04:23.670
"And you observe the final
outcome out of your measuring",00:04:23.670,00:04:29.210
"device, and you're trying
to guess which",00:04:29.210,00:04:31.820
particular branch occurred.,00:04:31.820,00:04:34.210
"That is, you're trying to guess
the state of the world",00:04:34.210,00:04:36.640
"based on a particular
measurement.",00:04:36.640,00:04:38.500
"That's what inference
is all about.",00:04:38.500,00:04:40.770
"So real world problems only
differ from the simple example",00:04:40.770,00:04:44.450
"that we saw last time in that
this kind of tree is a little",00:04:44.450,00:04:48.610
more complicated.,00:04:48.610,00:04:50.040
"You might have infinitely
many possible",00:04:50.040,00:04:52.150
outcomes here and so on.,00:04:52.150,00:04:54.450
"So setting up the model may be
more elaborate, but the basic",00:04:54.450,00:04:57.960
"calculation that's done based
on the Bayes rule is",00:04:57.960,00:05:01.170
"essentially the same as
the one that we saw.",00:05:01.170,00:05:04.430
"Now something that we discuss
is that sometimes we use",00:05:04.430,00:05:07.190
"conditional probabilities to
describe models, and let's do",00:05:07.190,00:05:11.050
"this by looking at a
model where we toss",00:05:11.050,00:05:14.030
a coin three times.,00:05:14.030,00:05:16.150
"And how do we use conditional
probabilities to",00:05:16.150,00:05:19.090
describe the situation?,00:05:19.090,00:05:20.630
So we have one experiment.,00:05:20.630,00:05:22.950
"But that one experiment consists
of three consecutive",00:05:22.950,00:05:26.590
coin tosses.,00:05:26.590,00:05:27.880
"So the possible outcomes, our
sample space, consists of",00:05:27.880,00:05:32.380
"strings of length 3 that tell
us whether we had heads,",00:05:32.380,00:05:37.070
"tails, and in what sequence.",00:05:37.070,00:05:39.200
"So three heads in a row is
one particular outcome.",00:05:39.200,00:05:43.110
"So what is the meaning
of those labels in",00:05:43.110,00:05:46.460
front of the branches?,00:05:46.460,00:05:48.030
"So this P here, of course,
stands for the probability",00:05:48.030,00:05:51.850
"that the first toss
resulted in heads.",00:05:51.850,00:05:55.640
"And let me use this notation
to denote that",00:05:55.640,00:05:59.270
the first was heads.,00:05:59.270,00:06:01.170
I put an H in toss one.,00:06:01.170,00:06:04.570
"How about the meaning of
this probability here?",00:06:04.570,00:06:08.350
"Well the meaning of this
probability is",00:06:08.350,00:06:10.570
a conditional one.,00:06:10.570,00:06:11.670
"It's the conditional probability
that the second",00:06:11.670,00:06:14.170
"toss resulted in heads,
given that the first",00:06:14.170,00:06:18.340
one resulted in heads.,00:06:18.340,00:06:21.440
"And similarly this label here
corresponds to the probability",00:06:21.440,00:06:26.830
"that the third toss resulted in
heads, given that the first",00:06:26.830,00:06:31.550
"one and the second one
resulted in heads.",00:06:31.550,00:06:35.010
"So in this particular model that
I wrote down here, those",00:06:35.010,00:06:39.610
"probabilities, P, of obtaining
heads remain the same no",00:06:39.610,00:06:44.740
"matter what happened in
the previous toss.",00:06:44.740,00:06:47.570
"For example, even if the first
toss was tails, we still have",00:06:47.570,00:06:52.020
"the same probability, P, that
the second one is heads, given",00:06:52.020,00:06:56.920
that the first one was tails.,00:06:56.920,00:06:59.100
"So we're assuming that no matter
what happened in the",00:06:59.100,00:07:01.820
"first toss, the second toss will
still have a conditional",00:07:01.820,00:07:05.550
"probability equal to P. So that
conditional probability",00:07:05.550,00:07:08.960
"does not depend on what happened
in the first toss.",00:07:08.960,00:07:12.800
"And we will see that this is a
very special situation, and",00:07:12.800,00:07:16.040
"that's really the concept of
independence that we are going",00:07:16.040,00:07:19.240
to introduce shortly.,00:07:19.240,00:07:20.850
"But before we get to
independence, let's practice",00:07:20.850,00:07:25.540
"once more the three skills that
we covered last time in",00:07:25.540,00:07:29.060
this example.,00:07:29.060,00:07:30.490
"So first skill was
multiplication rule.",00:07:30.490,00:07:33.470
"How do you find the
probability of",00:07:33.470,00:07:35.660
several things happening?,00:07:35.660,00:07:38.000
"That is the probability that
we have tails followed by",00:07:38.000,00:07:41.390
heads followed by tails.,00:07:41.390,00:07:44.140
"So here we're talking about this
particular outcome here,",00:07:44.140,00:07:50.350
"tails followed by heads
followed by tails.",00:07:50.350,00:07:53.130
"And the way we calculate such
a probability is by",00:07:53.130,00:07:57.070
"multiplying conditional
probabilities along the path",00:07:57.070,00:08:01.480
that takes us to this outcome.,00:08:01.480,00:08:03.560
"And so these conditional
probabilities",00:08:03.560,00:08:05.160
are recorded here.,00:08:05.160,00:08:06.220
"So it's going to be (1 minus P)
times P times (1 minus P).",00:08:06.220,00:08:11.840
"So this is the multiplication
rule.",00:08:11.840,00:08:14.480
"Second question is how do we
find the probability of a",00:08:14.480,00:08:17.990
mildly complicated event?,00:08:17.990,00:08:20.510
"So the event of interest here
that I wrote down is the",00:08:20.510,00:08:23.520
"probability that in the
three tosses, we had a",00:08:23.520,00:08:25.850
total of one head.,00:08:25.850,00:08:28.650
Exactly one head.,00:08:28.650,00:08:30.470
"This is an event that can
happen in multiple ways.",00:08:30.470,00:08:33.450
It happens here.,00:08:33.450,00:08:35.940
It happens here.,00:08:35.940,00:08:38.200
And it also happens here.,00:08:38.200,00:08:41.380
"So we want to find the total
probability of the event",00:08:41.380,00:08:44.480
"consisting of these
three outcomes.",00:08:44.480,00:08:46.290
What do we do?,00:08:46.290,00:08:47.370
"We just add the probabilities
of each individual outcome.",00:08:47.370,00:08:51.100
"How do we find the probability
of an individual outcome?",00:08:51.100,00:08:53.850
"Well, that's what we just did.",00:08:53.850,00:08:56.250
"Now notice that this outcome
has probability P times (1",00:08:56.250,00:09:00.300
minus P) squared.,00:09:00.300,00:09:01.550
That one should not be there.,00:09:04.260,00:09:07.000
So where is it?,00:09:07.000,00:09:08.984
Ah.,00:09:08.984,00:09:09.750
It's this one.,00:09:09.750,00:09:11.000
"OK, so the probability of this
outcome is (1 minus P times P)",00:09:13.830,00:09:18.610
"times (1 minus P), the
same probability.",00:09:18.610,00:09:20.970
"And finally, this one is again
(1 minus P) squared times P.",00:09:20.970,00:09:25.470
"So this event of one head can
happen in three ways.",00:09:25.470,00:09:29.240
"And each one of those three ways
has the same probability",00:09:29.240,00:09:32.270
of occurring.,00:09:32.270,00:09:33.380
And this is the answer.,00:09:33.380,00:09:36.440
"And finally, the last thing that
we learned how to do is",00:09:36.440,00:09:40.110
to use the Bayes rule to,00:09:40.110,00:09:41.980
calculate and make an inference.,00:09:41.980,00:09:44.230
"So somebody tells you that there
was exactly one head in",00:09:44.230,00:09:47.045
your three tosses.,00:09:47.045,00:09:49.350
"What is the probability
that the first",00:09:49.350,00:09:52.610
toss resulted in heads?,00:09:52.610,00:09:55.110
"OK, I guess you can guess the
answer here if I tell you that",00:09:55.110,00:09:59.980
there were three tosses.,00:09:59.980,00:10:01.710
One of them was heads.,00:10:01.710,00:10:03.590
"Where was that head
in the first, the",00:10:03.590,00:10:05.670
"second, or the third?",00:10:05.670,00:10:07.300
"Well, by symmetry, they should
all be equally likely.",00:10:07.300,00:10:10.410
"So there should be probably
just 1/3 that that head",00:10:10.410,00:10:13.770
occurred in the first toss.,00:10:13.770,00:10:16.070
"Let's check our intuition
using the definitions.",00:10:16.070,00:10:19.230
"So the definition of conditional
probability tells",00:10:19.230,00:10:21.280
"us the conditional probability
is the probability of both",00:10:21.280,00:10:26.030
things happening.,00:10:26.030,00:10:27.310
"First toss is heads, and we have
exactly one head divided",00:10:27.310,00:10:33.890
"by the probability
of one head.",00:10:33.890,00:10:36.430
"What is the probability that the
first toss is heads, and",00:10:40.720,00:10:44.860
we have exactly one head?,00:10:44.860,00:10:47.340
"This is the same as the event
heads, tails, tails.",00:10:47.340,00:10:51.810
"If I tell you that the first is
heads, and there's only one",00:10:51.810,00:10:54.280
"head, it means that the
others are tails.",00:10:54.280,00:10:57.030
"So this is the probability of
heads, tails, tails divided by",00:10:57.030,00:11:03.080
the probability of one head.,00:11:03.080,00:11:06.080
"And we know all of these
quantities probability of",00:11:06.080,00:11:08.660
"heads, tails, tails is P times
(1 minus P) squared.",00:11:08.660,00:11:12.080
"Probability of one
head is 3 times P",00:11:12.080,00:11:14.806
times (1 minus P) squared.,00:11:14.806,00:11:17.680
"So the final answer is 1/3,
which is what you should have",00:11:17.680,00:11:22.820
"a guessed on intuitive
grounds.",00:11:22.820,00:11:27.280
Very good.,00:11:27.280,00:11:27.740
"So we got our practice on
the material that we",00:11:27.740,00:11:31.110
did cover last time.,00:11:31.110,00:11:33.040
"Again, think.",00:11:33.040,00:11:33.700
"There's basically three basic
skills that we are practicing",00:11:33.700,00:11:38.050
and exercising here.,00:11:38.050,00:11:40.210
"In the problems, quizzes, and in
the real life, you may have",00:11:40.210,00:11:43.870
"to apply those three skills in
somewhat more complicated",00:11:43.870,00:11:47.560
"settings, but in the
end that's what it",00:11:47.560,00:11:49.590
boils down to usually.,00:11:49.590,00:11:51.860
"Now let's focus on this special
feature of this",00:11:51.860,00:11:55.240
"particular model that I
discussed a little earlier.",00:11:55.240,00:11:59.610
"Think of the event heads
in the second toss.",00:11:59.610,00:12:03.010
"Initially, the probability of
heads in the second toss, you",00:12:05.690,00:12:09.750
"know, that it's P, the
probability of",00:12:09.750,00:12:12.460
success of your coin.,00:12:12.460,00:12:14.290
"If I tell you that the first
toss resulted in heads, what's",00:12:14.290,00:12:19.100
"the probability that the
second toss is heads?",00:12:19.100,00:12:21.240
"It's again P. If I tell you that
the first toss was tails,",00:12:21.240,00:12:24.870
"what's the probability that
the second toss is heads?",00:12:24.870,00:12:27.510
"It's again P. So whether I tell
you the result of the",00:12:27.510,00:12:33.290
"first toss, or I don't tell
you, it doesn't make any",00:12:33.290,00:12:37.280
difference to you.,00:12:37.280,00:12:38.490
"You would always say the
probability of heads in the",00:12:38.490,00:12:40.690
"second toss is going to P, no
matter what happened in the",00:12:40.690,00:12:44.970
first toss.,00:12:44.970,00:12:46.400
"This is a special situation to
which we're going to give a",00:12:46.400,00:12:49.550
"name, and we're going to call
that property independence.",00:12:49.550,00:12:53.540
"Basically independence between
two things stands for the fact",00:12:53.540,00:12:58.520
"that the first thing, whether
it occurred or not, doesn't",00:12:58.520,00:13:02.690
"give you any information, does
not cause you to change your",00:13:02.690,00:13:05.630
"beliefs about the
second event.",00:13:05.630,00:13:08.980
This is the intuition.,00:13:08.980,00:13:11.600
"Let's try to translate this
into mathematics.",00:13:11.600,00:13:16.130
"We have two events, and we're
going to say that they're",00:13:16.130,00:13:19.510
"independent if your initial
beliefs about B are not going",00:13:19.510,00:13:26.010
"to change if I tell you
that A occurred.",00:13:26.010,00:13:30.140
"So you believe something
how likely B is.",00:13:30.140,00:13:34.700
"Then somebody comes and tells
you, you know, A has happened.",00:13:34.700,00:13:37.640
"Are you going to change
your beliefs?",00:13:37.640,00:13:39.790
"No, I'm not going
to change them.",00:13:39.790,00:13:42.200
"Whenever you are in such a
situation, then you say that",00:13:42.200,00:13:45.020
"the two events are
independent.",00:13:45.020,00:13:47.040
"Intuitively, the fact that A
occurred does not convey any",00:13:47.040,00:13:51.470
"information to you about the
likelihood of event B. The",00:13:51.470,00:13:55.720
"information that A provides
is not so",00:13:55.720,00:13:58.480
"useful, is not relevant.",00:13:58.480,00:14:00.780
"A has to do with
something else.",00:14:00.780,00:14:03.010
"It's not useful for your
guessing whether B is going to",00:14:03.010,00:14:06.250
occur or not.,00:14:06.250,00:14:07.780
"So we can take this as a first
attempt into a definition of",00:14:07.780,00:14:13.650
independence.,00:14:13.650,00:14:15.870
"Now remember that we have this
property, the probability of",00:14:15.870,00:14:23.130
"two things happening is the
probability of the first times",00:14:23.130,00:14:25.690
"the conditional probability
of the second.",00:14:25.690,00:14:27.920
"If we have independence, this
conditional probability is the",00:14:27.920,00:14:31.390
"same as the unconditional
probability.",00:14:31.390,00:14:33.840
"So if we have independence
according to that definition,",00:14:33.840,00:14:38.040
"we get this property that you
can find the probability of",00:14:38.040,00:14:41.190
"two things happening by just
multiplying their individual",00:14:41.190,00:14:44.440
probabilities.,00:14:44.440,00:14:45.640
"Probability of heads in
the first toss is 1/2.",00:14:45.640,00:14:48.070
"Probability of heads in the
second toss is 1/2.",00:14:48.070,00:14:50.900
"Probability of heads
heads is 1/4.",00:14:50.900,00:14:54.200
"That's what happens if your two
tosses are independent of",00:14:54.200,00:14:57.590
each other.,00:14:57.590,00:14:58.730
"So this property here is
a consequence of this",00:14:58.730,00:15:03.110
"definition, but it's actually
nicer, better, simpler,",00:15:03.110,00:15:08.470
"cleaner, more beautiful to take
this as our definition",00:15:08.470,00:15:12.880
instead of that one.,00:15:12.880,00:15:14.380
"Are the two definitions
equivalent?",00:15:14.380,00:15:17.180
"Well, they're are almost the
same, except for one thing.",00:15:17.180,00:15:21.040
"Conditional probabilities are
only defined if you condition",00:15:21.040,00:15:24.250
"on an event that has positive
probability.",00:15:24.250,00:15:26.900
"So this definition would be
limited to cases where event A",00:15:26.900,00:15:31.090
"has positive probability,
whereas this definition is",00:15:31.090,00:15:34.080
"something that you can
write down always.",00:15:34.080,00:15:38.140
"We will say that two events are
independent if and only if",00:15:38.140,00:15:43.280
"their probability of happening
simultaneously is equal to the",00:15:43.280,00:15:46.940
"product of their two individual
probabilities.",00:15:46.940,00:15:50.470
"And in particular, we can have
events of zero probability.",00:15:50.470,00:15:54.690
"There's nothing wrong
with that.",00:15:54.690,00:15:56.220
"If A has 0 probability, then A
intersection B will also have",00:15:56.220,00:16:01.450
"zero probability, because it's
an even smaller event.",00:16:01.450,00:16:04.990
"And so we're going to get
zero is equal to zero.",00:16:04.990,00:16:09.200
"A corollary of what I just said,
if an event A has zero",00:16:09.200,00:16:13.920
"probability, it's actually
independent of any other event",00:16:13.920,00:16:17.700
"in our model, because
we're going to get",00:16:17.700,00:16:20.220
zero is equal to zero.,00:16:20.220,00:16:21.810
"And the definition is going
to be satisfied.",00:16:21.810,00:16:24.140
"This is a little bit harder to
reconcile with the intuition",00:16:24.140,00:16:27.560
"we have about independence, but
then again, it's part of",00:16:27.560,00:16:32.800
the mathematical definition.,00:16:32.800,00:16:35.610
"So what I want you to retain
is this notion that the",00:16:35.610,00:16:40.450
"independence is something that
you can check formally using",00:16:40.450,00:16:46.300
"this definition, but also you
can check intuitively by if,",00:16:46.300,00:16:50.420
"in some cases, you can reason
that whatever happens and",00:16:50.420,00:16:54.280
"determines whether A is going
to occur or not, has nothing",00:16:54.280,00:16:58.310
"absolutely to do with whatever
happens and determines whether",00:16:58.310,00:17:01.850
B is going to occur or not.,00:17:01.850,00:17:04.369
"So if I'm doing a science
experiment in this room, and",00:17:04.369,00:17:08.440
"it gets hit by some noise that's
causes randomness.",00:17:08.440,00:17:12.569
"And then five years later,
somebody somewhere else does",00:17:12.569,00:17:16.040
"the same science experiment
somewhere else, it gets hit by",00:17:16.040,00:17:19.069
"other noise, you would usually
say that these experiments are",00:17:19.069,00:17:23.230
independent.,00:17:23.230,00:17:23.940
"So what events happen in one
experiment are not going to",00:17:23.940,00:17:30.230
"change your beliefs about what
might be happening in the",00:17:30.230,00:17:33.290
"other, because the sources of
noise in these two experiments",00:17:33.290,00:17:36.610
are completely unrelated.,00:17:36.610,00:17:38.350
"They have nothing to
do with each other.",00:17:38.350,00:17:40.110
"So if I flip a coin here today,
and I flip a coin in my",00:17:40.110,00:17:43.470
"office tomorrow, one shouldn't
affect the other.",00:17:43.470,00:17:47.890
"So the events that I get from
these should be independent.",00:17:47.890,00:17:52.690
"So that's usually how
independence arises.",00:17:52.690,00:17:55.700
By having distinct physical,00:17:55.700,00:17:57.580
phenomena that do not interact.,00:17:57.580,00:17:59.940
"Sometimes you also get
independence even though there",00:17:59.940,00:18:03.690
"is a physical interaction, but
you just happen to have a",00:18:03.690,00:18:06.590
numerical accident.,00:18:06.590,00:18:08.930
"A and B might be physically
related very tightly, but a",00:18:08.930,00:18:13.340
"numerical accident happens and
you get equality here, that's",00:18:13.340,00:18:16.820
"another case where we
do get independence.",00:18:16.820,00:18:20.070
"Now suppose that we have
two events that are",00:18:20.070,00:18:24.350
laid out like this.,00:18:24.350,00:18:27.380
"Are these two events
independent or not?",00:18:27.380,00:18:30.240
"The picture kind of tells
you that one is",00:18:34.570,00:18:36.620
separate from the other.,00:18:36.620,00:18:38.140
"But separate has nothing
to do with independent.",00:18:38.140,00:18:41.170
"In fact, these two events are as
dependent as Siamese twins.",00:18:41.170,00:18:45.340
Why is that?,00:18:45.340,00:18:46.480
"If I tell you that A occurred,
then you are certain that B",00:18:46.480,00:18:51.560
did not occur.,00:18:51.560,00:18:53.060
"So information about the
occurrence of A definitely",00:18:53.060,00:18:57.780
"affects your beliefs about the
possible occurrence or",00:18:57.780,00:19:01.090
"non-occurrence of B. When the
picture is like that, knowing",00:19:01.090,00:19:05.490
"that A occurred will change
drastically my beliefs about",00:19:05.490,00:19:09.480
"B, because now I suddenly
become certain",00:19:09.480,00:19:13.030
that B did not occur.,00:19:13.030,00:19:14.870
"So a picture like this is a
case actually of extreme",00:19:14.870,00:19:18.260
dependence.,00:19:18.260,00:19:19.360
"So don't confuse independence
with disjointness.",00:19:19.360,00:19:23.440
"They're very different
types of properties.",00:19:23.440,00:19:26.406
AUDIENCE: Question.,00:19:26.406,00:19:27.080
PROFESSOR: Yes?,00:19:27.080,00:19:27.520
"AUDIENCE: So I understand
the explanation, but the",00:19:27.520,00:19:29.400
"probability of A intersect B
[INAUDIBLE] to zero, because",00:19:29.400,00:19:31.954
they're disjoint.,00:19:31.954,00:19:32.910
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:19:32.910,00:19:33.388
"AUDIENCE: But then the product
of probability A and",00:19:33.388,00:19:35.539

is going to be 1.",00:19:35.539,00:19:37.690

the probabilities are 1/3,",00:19:39.602,00:19:42.690
"1/4, and the rest
is out there.",00:19:42.690,00:19:46.610
"You check the definition
of independence.",00:19:46.610,00:19:48.560
"Probability of A intersection
B is zero.",00:19:48.560,00:19:52.440
"Probability of A times the
probability of B is 1/12.",00:19:52.440,00:19:58.520
The two are not equal.,00:19:58.520,00:20:00.630
"Therefore we do not
have independence.",00:20:00.630,00:20:02.710
AUDIENCE: Right.,00:20:02.710,00:20:03.199
"So what's wrong with the
intuition of the probability",00:20:03.199,00:20:05.644
"of A being 1, and the
other one being 0?",00:20:05.644,00:20:09.556
[INAUDIBLE].,00:20:09.556,00:20:12.490
PROFESSOR: No.,00:20:12.490,00:20:12.610

B is equal to 0.",00:20:12.610,00:20:19.340
"Probability of A is
equal to 1/3.",00:20:19.340,00:20:23.870
"So again, these two
are different.",00:20:23.870,00:20:26.650
"So we had some initial beliefs
about A, but as soon as we are",00:20:26.650,00:20:30.210
"told that B occurred, our
beliefs about A changed.",00:20:30.210,00:20:34.440
"And so since our beliefs
changed, that means that B",00:20:34.440,00:20:37.770
conveys information about A.,00:20:37.770,00:20:40.666
"AUDIENCE: So can you not draw
independent [INAUDIBLE] on a",00:20:40.666,00:20:42.931
Venn diagram?,00:20:42.931,00:20:43.390
PROFESSOR: I can't hear you.,00:20:43.390,00:20:44.430

independence on a Venn diagram?,00:20:45.352,00:20:46.735
"PROFESSOR: No, the Venn diagram
is never enough to",00:20:46.735,00:20:51.320
decide independence.,00:20:51.320,00:20:53.400
"So the typical picture in which
you're going to have",00:20:53.400,00:20:56.350
"independence would be one event
this way, and another",00:20:56.350,00:21:00.120
event this way.,00:21:00.120,00:21:01.760
"You need to take the probability
of this times the",00:21:01.760,00:21:03.800
"probability of that, and check
that, numerically, it's equal",00:21:03.800,00:21:07.795
"to the probability of
this intersection.",00:21:07.795,00:21:11.350
"So it's more than
a Venn diagram.",00:21:11.350,00:21:14.330
"Numbers need to come
out right.",00:21:14.330,00:21:16.138
"Now we did say some time ago
that conditional probabilities",00:21:19.730,00:21:23.570
"are just like ordinary
probabilities, and whatever we",00:21:23.570,00:21:27.680
"do in probability theory
can also be done",00:21:27.680,00:21:31.870

"Talking about conditional
probabilities.",00:21:34.350,00:21:37.680

independence, then there",00:21:37.680,00:21:42.870
"should be also a notion of
conditional independence.",00:21:42.870,00:21:47.470

by the probability that A",00:21:47.470,00:21:55.070

definition of conditional",00:22:01.920,00:22:05.670
independence?,00:22:05.670,00:22:06.840
"Conditional independence would
mean that this same property",00:22:06.840,00:22:09.355
"could be true, but in a
conditional universe where we",00:22:09.355,00:22:13.210
"are told that the certain
event happens.",00:22:13.210,00:22:15.660
"So if we're told that the event
C has happened, then",00:22:15.660,00:22:19.060
"were transported in a
conditional universe where the",00:22:19.060,00:22:22.240
"only thing that matters are
conditional probabilities.",00:22:22.240,00:22:26.460
"And this is just the same plain,
previous definition of",00:22:26.460,00:22:31.320
"independence, but applied in
a conditional universe.",00:22:31.320,00:22:35.190
"So this is the definition of
conditional independence.",00:22:35.190,00:22:40.020
"So it's independence, but with
reference to the conditional",00:22:43.390,00:22:46.940
probabilities.,00:22:46.940,00:22:48.830
"And intuitively it has, again,
the same meaning, that in the",00:22:48.830,00:22:51.830
"conditional world, if I tell you
that A occurred, then that",00:22:51.830,00:22:56.410
"doesn't change your
beliefs about B.",00:22:56.410,00:22:58.940
"So suppose you had a
picture like this.",00:22:58.940,00:23:01.100
"And somebody told you that
events A and B are independent",00:23:01.100,00:23:06.880
unconditionally.,00:23:06.880,00:23:09.630
"Then somebody comes and tells
you that event C actually has",00:23:09.630,00:23:14.320
"occurred, so we now live
in this new universe.",00:23:14.320,00:23:18.150
"In this new universe, is the
independence of A and B going",00:23:18.150,00:23:22.450
to be preserved or not?,00:23:22.450,00:23:25.180
"Are A and B independent
in this new universe?",00:23:25.180,00:23:29.300
"The answer is no, because in the
new universe, whatever is",00:23:29.300,00:23:34.780
left of event A is this piece.,00:23:34.780,00:23:36.790
"Whatever is left of event
B is this piece.",00:23:36.790,00:23:39.630
"And these two pieces
are disjoint.",00:23:39.630,00:23:42.310
"So we are back in a situation
of this kind.",00:23:42.310,00:23:45.490
So in the conditional,00:23:45.490,00:23:46.450
"universe, A and B are disjoint.",00:23:46.450,00:23:49.620
"And therefore, generically,
they're not going to be",00:23:49.620,00:23:53.380
independent.,00:23:53.380,00:23:54.730
"What's the moral of
this example?",00:23:54.730,00:23:58.030
"Having independence in the
original model does not imply",00:23:58.030,00:24:01.870
"independence in a conditional
model.",00:24:01.870,00:24:05.930
The opposite is also possible.,00:24:05.930,00:24:08.490
"And let's illustrate
by another example.",00:24:08.490,00:24:12.160
"So I have two coins, and both
of them are badly biased.",00:24:12.160,00:24:17.960
"One coin is much biased
in favor of heads.",00:24:17.960,00:24:21.680
"The other coin is much biased
in favor of tails.",00:24:21.680,00:24:25.320
"So the probabilities
being 90%.",00:24:25.320,00:24:28.050
"Let's consider independent flips
of coin A. This is the",00:24:28.050,00:24:33.050
relevant model.,00:24:33.050,00:24:34.980
"This is a model of two
independent flips",00:24:34.980,00:24:39.600
of the first coin.,00:24:39.600,00:24:41.240
"There's going to be two flips,
and each one has probability",00:24:41.240,00:24:43.850
0.9 of being heads.,00:24:43.850,00:24:46.080
"So that's a model that describes
coin A. You can",00:24:46.080,00:24:49.330
"think of this as a conditional
model which is a model of the",00:24:49.330,00:24:52.540
"coin flips conditioned on the
fact that they have chosen",00:24:52.540,00:24:55.940
coin A.,00:24:55.940,00:24:57.460
"Alternatively we could be
dealing with coin B In a",00:24:57.460,00:25:01.460
"conditional world where we
chose coin B and flip it",00:25:01.460,00:25:05.260
"twice, this is the
relevant model.",00:25:05.260,00:25:08.130
"The probability of two heads,
for example, is the",00:25:08.130,00:25:10.660
"probability of heads the first
time, heads the second time,",00:25:10.660,00:25:13.280
and each one is 0.1.,00:25:13.280,00:25:16.070
"Now I'm building this into a
bigger experiment in which I",00:25:16.070,00:25:19.960
"first start by choosing one of
the two coins at random.",00:25:19.960,00:25:25.160
So I have these two coins.,00:25:25.160,00:25:26.620
I blindly pick one of them.,00:25:26.620,00:25:28.610
"And then I start
flipping them.",00:25:28.610,00:25:32.610
"So the question now is, are the
coin flips, or the coin",00:25:32.610,00:25:36.620
"tosses, are they independent
of each other?",00:25:36.620,00:25:39.730
"If we just stay inside this
sub-model here, are the coin",00:25:39.730,00:25:46.370
flips independent?,00:25:46.370,00:25:47.620
"They are independent, because
the probability of heads in",00:25:52.240,00:25:56.540
"the second toss is the same,
0.9, no matter what happened",00:25:56.540,00:26:01.780
in the first toss.,00:26:01.780,00:26:03.550
"So the conditional probabilities
of what happens",00:26:03.550,00:26:06.550
"in the second toss are not
affected by the outcome of the",00:26:06.550,00:26:10.050
first toss.,00:26:10.050,00:26:11.180
"So the second toss and the first
toss are independent.",00:26:11.180,00:26:14.620
"So here we're just dealing
with plain,",00:26:14.620,00:26:17.800
independent coin flips.,00:26:17.800,00:26:19.990
"Similarity the coin flips within
this sub-model are also",00:26:19.990,00:26:24.940
independent.,00:26:24.940,00:26:26.190
"Now the question is, if we look
at the big model as just",00:26:28.840,00:26:33.410
"one probability model, instead
of looking at the conditional",00:26:33.410,00:26:38.955
"sub-models, are the coin flips
independent of each other?",00:26:38.955,00:26:44.530
"Does the outcome of a few coin
flips give you information",00:26:44.530,00:26:49.590
about subsequent coin flips?,00:26:49.590,00:26:53.610
"Well if I observe ten
heads in a row--",00:26:53.610,00:27:02.570
"So instead of two coin flips,
now let's think of doing more",00:27:02.570,00:27:05.960
"of them so that the tree
gets expanded.",00:27:05.960,00:27:10.070
So let's start with this.,00:27:10.070,00:27:13.800
I don't know which coin it is.,00:27:13.800,00:27:16.020
"What's the probability that
the 11th coin toss",00:27:16.020,00:27:18.970
is going to be heads?,00:27:18.970,00:27:20.220
"There's complete symmetry here,
so the answer could not",00:27:25.570,00:27:29.370
be anything other than 1/2.,00:27:29.370,00:27:32.330
"So let's justify it,
why is it 1/2?",00:27:32.330,00:27:36.950
"Well, the probability that the
11th toss is heads, how can",00:27:36.950,00:27:40.560
that outcome happen?,00:27:40.560,00:27:42.380
It can happen in two ways.,00:27:42.380,00:27:43.840
"You can choose coin A, which
happens with probability 1/2.",00:27:43.840,00:27:50.480
"And having chosen coin A,
there's probability 0.9 that",00:27:50.480,00:27:54.370
"it results in that you get
heads in the 11th toss.",00:27:54.370,00:27:58.500
"Or you can choose coin B. And
if it's coin B when you flip",00:27:58.500,00:28:03.540
"it, there's probably 0.1
that you have heads.",00:28:03.540,00:28:06.710
So the final answer is 1/2.,00:28:06.710,00:28:08.860
"So each one of the coins is
biased, but they're biased in",00:28:11.370,00:28:14.820
different ways.,00:28:14.820,00:28:16.190
"If I don't know which coin it
is, their two biases kind of",00:28:16.190,00:28:20.340
"cancel out, and the probability
of obtaining heads",00:28:20.340,00:28:23.740
"is just in the middle,
then it's 1/2.",00:28:23.740,00:28:27.880
"Now if someone tells you that
the first ten tosses were",00:28:27.880,00:28:31.720
"heads, is that going to
change your beliefs",00:28:31.720,00:28:34.940
about the 11th toss?,00:28:34.940,00:28:37.300
"Here's how a reasonable person
would think about it.",00:28:37.300,00:28:41.820
"If it's coin B the probability
of obtaining 10 heads in a row",00:28:41.820,00:28:49.480
is negligible.,00:28:49.480,00:28:51.510
"It's going to be 0.1
to the 10th.",00:28:51.510,00:28:55.270
"If it's coin A. The probability
of 10 heads in a",00:28:55.270,00:28:59.110
"row is a more reasonable
number.",00:28:59.110,00:29:01.380
It's 0.9 to the 10th.,00:29:01.380,00:29:03.850
"So this event is a lot more
likely to occur with coin A,",00:29:03.850,00:29:10.320
rather than coin B.,00:29:10.320,00:29:13.910
"The plausible explanation of
having seen ten heads in a row",00:29:13.910,00:29:18.820
"is that I actually chose coin A.
When you see ten heads in a",00:29:18.820,00:29:25.730
"row, you are pretty certain that
it's coin A that we're",00:29:25.730,00:29:29.690
dealing with.,00:29:29.690,00:29:30.940
"And once you're pretty certain
that it's coin A that we're",00:29:30.940,00:29:33.800
"dealing with, what's the
probability that the",00:29:33.800,00:29:36.350
next toss is heads?,00:29:36.350,00:29:38.246
It's going to be 0.9.,00:29:38.246,00:29:40.960
"So essentially here I'm doing
an inference calculation.",00:29:40.960,00:29:45.270
"Given this information, I'm
making an inference about",00:29:45.270,00:29:48.990
which coin I'm dealing with.,00:29:48.990,00:29:50.700
"I become pretty certain that
it's coin A, and given that",00:29:53.540,00:29:57.240
"it's coin A, this probability
is going to be 0.9.",00:29:57.240,00:30:00.640
"And I'm putting an approximate
sign here, because the",00:30:00.640,00:30:04.070
"inference that I did
is approximate.",00:30:04.070,00:30:06.220
"I'm pretty certain it's coin A.
I'm not 100% certain that",00:30:06.220,00:30:09.850
it's coin A.,00:30:09.850,00:30:11.200
"But in any case what happens
here is that the unconditional",00:30:11.200,00:30:15.430
"probability is different from
the conditional probability.",00:30:15.430,00:30:19.440
"This information here makes
me change my beliefs",00:30:19.440,00:30:23.710
about the 11th toss.,00:30:23.710,00:30:25.590
"And this means that the 11th
toss is dependent on the",00:30:25.590,00:30:30.560
previous tosses.,00:30:30.560,00:30:31.530
"So the coin tosses have
now become dependent.",00:30:31.530,00:30:35.590
"What is the physical link that
causes this dependence?",00:30:35.590,00:30:38.790
"Well, the physical link is
the choice of the coin.",00:30:38.790,00:30:42.710
"By choosing a particular coin,
I'm introducing a pattern in",00:30:42.710,00:30:46.580
the future coin tosses.,00:30:46.580,00:30:48.200
"And that pattern is what
causes dependence.",00:30:48.200,00:30:52.740
"OK, so I've been playing a
little bit too loose with the",00:30:52.740,00:30:55.670
"language here, because we
defined the concept of",00:30:55.670,00:30:59.810
independence of two events.,00:30:59.810,00:31:01.810
"But here I have been referring
to independent coin tosses,",00:31:01.810,00:31:06.180
"where I'm thinking about
many coin tosses,",00:31:06.180,00:31:08.380
like 10 or 11 of them.,00:31:08.380,00:31:11.200
"So to be proper, I should have
defined for you also the",00:31:11.200,00:31:15.160
"notion of independence of
multiple events, not just two.",00:31:15.160,00:31:18.710
"We don't want to just say coin
toss one is independent from",00:31:18.710,00:31:21.970
coin toss two.,00:31:21.970,00:31:23.170
"We want to be able to say
something like, these 10 then",00:31:23.170,00:31:26.250
"coin tosses are all independent
of each other.",00:31:26.250,00:31:29.690
"Intuitively what that means
should be the same thing--",00:31:29.690,00:31:33.800
"that information about some of
the coin tosses doesn't change",00:31:33.800,00:31:37.450
"your beliefs about the remaining
coin tosses.",00:31:37.450,00:31:40.220
"How do we translate that into
a mathematical definition?",00:31:40.220,00:31:43.580
"Well, an ugly attempt
would be to impose",00:31:43.580,00:31:48.600
requirements such as this.,00:31:48.600,00:31:51.800
"Think of A1 being the event that
the first flip was heads.",00:31:51.800,00:31:56.780
"A2 is the event of that the
second flip was heads.",00:31:56.780,00:32:00.980
"A3, the third flip, was
heads, and so on.",00:32:00.980,00:32:04.320
"Here is an event whose
occurrence is not determined",00:32:04.320,00:32:08.310
by the first three coin flips.,00:32:08.310,00:32:10.860
"And here's an event whose
occurrence or not is",00:32:10.860,00:32:13.400
"determined by the fifth
and sixth coin flip.",00:32:13.400,00:32:16.680
"If we think physically that
all those coin flips have",00:32:16.680,00:32:19.080
"nothing to do with each other,
information about the fifth",00:32:19.080,00:32:22.220
"and sixth coin flip are not
going to change what we expect",00:32:22.220,00:32:26.420
from the first three.,00:32:26.420,00:32:27.960
"So the probability of this
event, the conditional",00:32:27.960,00:32:30.780
"probability, should be the
same as the unconditional",00:32:30.780,00:32:33.050
probability.,00:32:33.050,00:32:34.430
"And we would like a relation
of this kind to be true, no",00:32:34.430,00:32:38.850
"matter what kind of formula you
write down, as long as the",00:32:38.850,00:32:43.480
"events that show up here are
different from the events that",00:32:43.480,00:32:47.230
show up there.,00:32:47.230,00:32:49.250
OK.,00:32:49.250,00:32:49.770
"That's sort of an
ugly definition.",00:32:49.770,00:32:52.150
"The mathematical definition that
actually does the job,",00:32:52.150,00:32:55.350
"and leads to all the
formulas of this",00:32:55.350,00:32:59.530
"kind, is the following.",00:32:59.530,00:33:01.130
"We're going to say that the
collection of events are",00:33:01.130,00:33:03.610
"independent if we can find the
probability of their joint",00:33:03.610,00:33:07.090
"occurrence by just multiplying
probabilities.",00:33:07.090,00:33:11.780
"And that will be true even if
you look at sub-collections of",00:33:11.780,00:33:17.380
these events.,00:33:17.380,00:33:18.640
Let's make that more precise.,00:33:18.640,00:33:20.670
"If we have three events, the
definition tells us that the",00:33:20.670,00:33:24.310
"three events are independent
if the following are true.",00:33:24.310,00:33:27.560
"Probability A1 and A2 and A3,
you can calculate this",00:33:27.560,00:33:31.830
"probability by multiplying
individual probabilities.",00:33:31.830,00:33:34.840
"But the same is true even if
you take fewer events.",00:33:38.370,00:33:44.320
"Just a few indices out
of the indices",00:33:44.320,00:33:46.740
that we have available.,00:33:46.740,00:33:48.340
"So we also require P(A1
intersection A2) is P(A1)",00:33:48.340,00:33:54.970
times P(A2).,00:33:54.970,00:33:57.600
"And similarly for the other
possibilities of",00:33:57.600,00:34:01.250
choosing the indices.,00:34:01.250,00:34:02.500
"OK, so independence,
mathematical definition,",00:34:10.900,00:34:14.659
"requires that calculating
probabilities of any",00:34:14.659,00:34:18.860
"intersection of the events we
have in our hands, that",00:34:18.860,00:34:22.370
"calculation can be done by just
multiplying individual",00:34:22.370,00:34:25.590
probabilities.,00:34:25.590,00:34:27.000
"And this has to apply to the
case where we consider all of",00:34:27.000,00:34:30.230
the events in our hands or just,00:34:30.230,00:34:33.300
sub-collections of those events.,00:34:33.300,00:34:36.900
"Now these relations just by
themselves are called pairwise",00:34:36.900,00:34:42.130
independence.,00:34:42.130,00:34:44.389
"So this relation, for example,
tells us that A1 is",00:34:44.389,00:34:47.179
independent from A2.,00:34:47.179,00:34:48.710
"This tells us that A2 is
independent from A3.",00:34:48.710,00:34:51.130
"This will tell us that A1
is independent from A3.",00:34:51.130,00:34:54.670
"But independence of all the
events together actually",00:34:54.670,00:34:58.990
requires a little more.,00:34:58.990,00:35:01.020
"One more equality that has to do
with all three events being",00:35:01.020,00:35:05.080
considered at the same time.,00:35:05.080,00:35:07.000
"And this extra equality
is not redundant.",00:35:07.000,00:35:10.562
"It actually does make
a difference.",00:35:10.562,00:35:13.020
"Independence and pairwise
independence",00:35:13.020,00:35:15.390
are different things.,00:35:15.390,00:35:17.310
"So let's illustrate the
situation with an example.",00:35:17.310,00:35:20.320
"Suppose we have two
coin flips.",00:35:20.320,00:35:22.790
"The coin tosses are independent,
so the bias is",00:35:22.790,00:35:28.390
"1/2, so all possible outcomes
have a probability of 1/2",00:35:28.390,00:35:32.910
"times 1/2, which is 1/4.",00:35:32.910,00:35:36.100
"And let's consider now a bunch
of different events.",00:35:36.100,00:35:40.520
"One event is that the
first toss is heads.",00:35:40.520,00:35:46.290
This is this blue set here.,00:35:46.290,00:35:48.950
"Another event is the second
toss is heads.",00:35:48.950,00:35:54.990
"And this is this black
event here.",00:35:54.990,00:35:57.970
OK.,00:36:00.770,00:36:01.850
"Are these two events
independent?",00:36:01.850,00:36:04.500
"If you check it mathematically,
yes.",00:36:04.500,00:36:06.660
"Probability of A is probability
of B is 1/2.",00:36:06.660,00:36:09.270
"Probability of A times
probability of B is 1/4, which",00:36:09.270,00:36:13.170
"is the same as the probability
of A intersection B,",00:36:13.170,00:36:16.700
which is this set.,00:36:16.700,00:36:18.070
"So we have just checked
mathematically that A and B",00:36:18.070,00:36:20.680
are independent.,00:36:20.680,00:36:22.180
"Now lets consider a third event
which is that the first",00:36:22.180,00:36:26.210
"and second toss give
the same result.",00:36:26.210,00:36:30.080
I'll use a different color.,00:36:30.080,00:36:32.270
"First and second toss to
give the same result.",00:36:32.270,00:36:35.400
"This is the event that
we obtain heads,",00:36:35.400,00:36:38.350
"heads or tails, tails.",00:36:38.350,00:36:40.700
"So this is the probability
of C. What's the",00:36:40.700,00:36:43.030
probability of C?,00:36:43.030,00:36:44.280
"Well, C is made up of two
outcomes, each one of which",00:36:47.790,00:36:51.520
"has probability 1/4, so the
probability of C is 1/2.",00:36:51.520,00:36:55.500
"What is the probability
of C intersection A?",00:36:55.500,00:36:58.600
"C intersection A is just this
one outcome, and has",00:36:58.600,00:37:02.760
probability 1/4.,00:37:02.760,00:37:06.030
"What's the probability of A
intersection B intersection C?",00:37:06.030,00:37:10.040
"The three events intersect just
this outcome, so this",00:37:10.040,00:37:13.650
probability is also 1/4.,00:37:13.650,00:37:15.620
OK.,00:37:18.610,00:37:19.860
"What's the probability
of C given A and B?",00:37:24.130,00:37:27.060
"If A has occurred, and B has
occurred, you are certain that",00:37:29.800,00:37:34.840
this outcome here happened.,00:37:34.840,00:37:36.980
"If the first toss is H and the
second toss is H, then you're",00:37:36.980,00:37:40.160
"certain of the first
and second toss",00:37:40.160,00:37:41.970
gave the same result.,00:37:41.970,00:37:43.760
"So the conditional probability
of C given A and",00:37:43.760,00:37:46.500
B is equal to 1.,00:37:46.500,00:37:49.050
"So do we have independence
in this example?",00:37:49.050,00:37:51.640
We don't.,00:37:54.310,00:37:55.970
"C, that we obtain the same
result in the first and the",00:37:55.970,00:38:00.210
"second toss, has probability
1/2.",00:38:00.210,00:38:04.020
"Half of the possible outcomes
give us two coin flips with",00:38:04.020,00:38:08.480
"the same result-- heads,
heads or tails, tails.",00:38:08.480,00:38:10.700
"So the probability
of C is 1/2.",00:38:10.700,00:38:12.970
"But if I tell you that the
events A and B both occurred,",00:38:12.970,00:38:17.590
"then you're certain
that C occurred.",00:38:17.590,00:38:20.900
"If I tell you that we had heads
and heads, then you're",00:38:20.900,00:38:23.190
"certain the outcomes
were the same.",00:38:23.190,00:38:25.460
"So the conditional probability
is different from the",00:38:25.460,00:38:28.830
unconditional probability.,00:38:28.830,00:38:31.400
"So by combining these two
relations together, we get",00:38:31.400,00:38:37.050
"that the three events
are not independent.",00:38:37.050,00:38:39.235
"But are they pairwise
independent?",00:38:42.260,00:38:45.520
Is A independent from B?,00:38:45.520,00:38:49.020
"Yes, because probability of A
times probability of B is 1/4,",00:38:49.020,00:38:53.400
"which is probability of
A intersection B. Is C",00:38:53.400,00:38:58.670
independent from A?,00:38:58.670,00:39:02.350
"Well, the probability
of C and A is 1/4.",00:39:02.350,00:39:05.780
The probability of C is 1/2.,00:39:05.780,00:39:07.620
The probability of A is 1/2.,00:39:07.620,00:39:09.830
So it checks.,00:39:09.830,00:39:11.150
"1/4 is equal to 1/2 and 1/2,
so event C and event A are",00:39:11.150,00:39:17.960
independent.,00:39:17.960,00:39:19.410
"Knowing that the first toss was
heads does not change your",00:39:19.410,00:39:24.490
"beliefs about whether the two
tosses are going to have the",00:39:24.490,00:39:28.600
same outcome or not.,00:39:28.600,00:39:31.380
"Knowing that the first was
heads, well, the second is",00:39:31.380,00:39:34.200
"equally likely to be
heads or tails.",00:39:34.200,00:39:36.520
"So event C has just the
same probability,",00:39:36.520,00:39:39.710
"again, 1/2, to occur.",00:39:39.710,00:39:42.140
"To put it the opposite way,
if I tell you that the two",00:39:42.140,00:39:46.110
results were the same--,00:39:46.110,00:39:47.860
"so it's either heads, heads
or tails, tails--",00:39:47.860,00:39:51.130
"what does that tell you
about the first toss?",00:39:51.130,00:39:53.070
"Is it heads, or is it tails?",00:39:53.070,00:39:54.800
"Well, it doesn't tell
you anything.",00:39:54.800,00:39:56.570
"It could be either over the
two, so the probability of",00:39:56.570,00:39:59.700
"heads in the first toss is equal
to 1/2, and telling you",00:39:59.700,00:40:04.490
"C occurred does not
change anything.",00:40:04.490,00:40:07.460
"So this is an example that
illustrates the case where we",00:40:07.460,00:40:10.830
"have three events in which
we check that pairwise",00:40:10.830,00:40:14.650
"independence holds for
any combination of",00:40:14.650,00:40:18.140
two of these events.,00:40:18.140,00:40:19.250
"We have the probability of their
intersection is equal to",00:40:19.250,00:40:21.900
"the product of their
probabilities.",00:40:21.900,00:40:23.760
"On the other hand, the three
events taken all together are",00:40:23.760,00:40:27.930
not independent.,00:40:27.930,00:40:29.500
"A doesn't tell me anything
useful, whether C is going to",00:40:29.500,00:40:32.780
occur or not.,00:40:32.780,00:40:34.710
"B doesn't tell me
anything useful.",00:40:34.710,00:40:36.730
"But if I tell you that both A
and B occurred, the two of",00:40:36.730,00:40:40.840
"them together tell me something
useful about C.",00:40:40.840,00:40:44.150
"Namely, they tell me that C
certainly has occurred.",00:40:44.150,00:40:47.165
Very good.,00:40:49.750,00:40:51.000
"So independence is this somewhat
subtle concept.",00:40:53.900,00:40:56.890
"Once you grasp the intuition of
what it really means, then",00:40:56.890,00:40:59.710
things perhaps fall in place.,00:40:59.710,00:41:02.910
"But it's a concept where
it's easy to get some",00:41:02.910,00:41:06.630
misunderstanding.,00:41:06.630,00:41:07.430
"So just take some
time to digest.",00:41:07.430,00:41:11.370
"So to lighten things up, I'm
going to spend the remaining",00:41:11.370,00:41:14.810
"four minutes talking about the
very nice, simple problem that",00:41:14.810,00:41:18.810
"involves conditional
probabilities and the like.",00:41:18.810,00:41:23.240
"So here's the problem,
formulated exactly as it shows",00:41:23.240,00:41:28.140
up in various textbooks.,00:41:28.140,00:41:30.250
"And the formulation says
the following.",00:41:30.250,00:41:31.780
"Well, consider one of those
anachronistic places where",00:41:31.780,00:41:35.310
"they still have kings or queens,
and where actually",00:41:35.310,00:41:40.050
"boys take precedence
over girls.",00:41:40.050,00:41:43.090
So if there is a boy--,00:41:43.090,00:41:44.600
"if the royal family has a boy,
then he will become the king",00:41:47.280,00:41:52.400
"even if he has an older sister
who might be the queen.",00:41:52.400,00:41:58.080
"So we have one of those
royal families.",00:41:58.080,00:42:02.930
"That royal family had two
children, and we know that",00:42:02.930,00:42:06.810
there is a king.,00:42:06.810,00:42:08.060
"There is a king, which means
that at least one of the two",00:42:11.370,00:42:14.250
children was a boy.,00:42:14.250,00:42:16.030
"Otherwise we wouldn't
have a king.",00:42:16.030,00:42:18.970
"What is the probability that the
king's sibling is female?",00:42:18.970,00:42:21.885
OK.,00:42:24.920,00:42:26.170
"I guess we need to make some
assumptions about genetics.",00:42:28.260,00:42:30.830
"Let's assume that every child
is a boy or a girl with",00:42:30.830,00:42:33.910
"probability 1/2, and that
different children, what they",00:42:33.910,00:42:39.440
"are is independent from what
the other children were.",00:42:39.440,00:42:42.900
"So every childbirth is basically
a coin flip.",00:42:42.900,00:42:47.660
"OK, so if you take that,
you say, well,",00:42:47.660,00:42:50.740
the king is a child.,00:42:50.740,00:42:52.980
His sibling is another child.,00:42:52.980,00:42:55.890
"Children are independent
of each other.",00:42:55.890,00:42:58.450
"So the probability that the
sibling is a girl is 1/2.",00:42:58.450,00:43:05.860
That's the naive answer.,00:43:05.860,00:43:07.620
"Now let's try to
do it formally.",00:43:07.620,00:43:09.270
"Let's set up a model
of the experiment.",00:43:09.270,00:43:12.410
"The royal family had two
children, as we we're told, so",00:43:12.410,00:43:15.650
there's four outcomes--,00:43:15.650,00:43:17.020
"boy boy, boy girl, girl
boy, and girl girl.",00:43:17.020,00:43:22.040
"Now, we are told that there is
a king, which means what?",00:43:22.040,00:43:26.520
"This outcome here
did not happen.",00:43:26.520,00:43:29.530
It is not possible.,00:43:29.530,00:43:30.760
"There are three outcomes
that remain possible.",00:43:30.760,00:43:33.810
"So this is our conditional
sample space given",00:43:33.810,00:43:37.940
that there is king.,00:43:37.940,00:43:40.500
"What are the probabilities
for the original model?",00:43:40.500,00:43:43.170
"Well with the model that we
assume that every child is a",00:43:43.170,00:43:46.420
"boy or a girl independently with
probability 1/2, then the",00:43:46.420,00:43:50.885
"four outcomes would be equally
likely, and they're like this.",00:43:50.885,00:43:54.950
"These are the original
probabilities.",00:43:54.950,00:43:57.110
"But once we are told that this
outcome did not happen,",00:43:57.110,00:44:00.810
"because we have a king, then
we are transported to the",00:44:00.810,00:44:03.900
smaller sample space.,00:44:03.900,00:44:05.830
"In this sample space, what's
the probability that the",00:44:05.830,00:44:08.380
sibling is a girl?,00:44:08.380,00:44:10.360
"Well the sibling is a girl in
two out of the three outcomes.",00:44:10.360,00:44:15.160
"So the probability that
the sibling is a",00:44:15.160,00:44:17.290
girl is actually 2/3.,00:44:17.290,00:44:21.880
"So that's supposed to
be the right answer.",00:44:21.880,00:44:25.780
"Maybe a little
counter-intuitive.",00:44:25.780,00:44:29.620
"So you can play smart and say,
oh I understand such problems",00:44:29.620,00:44:32.960
"better than you, here is a trick
problem and here's why",00:44:32.960,00:44:35.990
the answer is 2/3.,00:44:35.990,00:44:37.800
"But actually I'm not fully
justified in saying that the",00:44:37.800,00:44:41.300
answer is 2/3.,00:44:41.300,00:44:42.930
"I made lots of hidden
assumptions when I put this",00:44:42.930,00:44:46.520
"model down, which I
didn't yet state.",00:44:46.520,00:44:50.040
"So to reverse engineer this
answer, let's actually think",00:44:50.040,00:44:54.960
"what's the probability model for
which this would have been",00:44:54.960,00:44:57.960
the right answer.,00:44:57.960,00:44:59.320
"And here's the probability
model.",00:44:59.320,00:45:01.300
The royal family--,00:45:01.300,00:45:02.800
"the royal parents decided to
have exactly two children.",00:45:02.800,00:45:07.050
They went and had them.,00:45:07.050,00:45:08.960
"It turned out that at
least one was a boy",00:45:08.960,00:45:11.670
and became a king.,00:45:11.670,00:45:13.390
Under this scenario--,00:45:13.390,00:45:15.580
"that they decide to have
exactly two children--",00:45:15.580,00:45:18.070
"then this is the big
sample space.",00:45:18.070,00:45:20.840
"It turned out that
one was a boy.",00:45:20.840,00:45:23.350
That eliminates this outcome.,00:45:23.350,00:45:25.560
"And then this picture
is correct and this",00:45:25.560,00:45:27.410
is the right answer.,00:45:27.410,00:45:28.750
"But there's hidden assumptions
being there.",00:45:28.750,00:45:31.680
"How about if the royal
family had followed",00:45:31.680,00:45:35.170
the following strategy?,00:45:35.170,00:45:37.230
