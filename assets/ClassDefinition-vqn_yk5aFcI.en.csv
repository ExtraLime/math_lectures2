"PROFESSOR: So, which
of the following",00:00:22.499,00:00:24.040
"is a good and valid definition
for a class representing a car?",00:00:24.040,00:00:28.820
"OK, most of the people
I think have gotten it,",00:00:28.820,00:00:31.790
"which is the red, which
says class car object,",00:00:31.790,00:00:35.570
and that's perfect.,00:00:35.570,00:00:37.180
OK.,00:00:37.180,00:00:38.020
"So this defines a function,
this defines a class correctly,",00:00:38.020,00:00:41.750
"but A is just not
descriptive name at all,",00:00:41.750,00:00:45.190
"and this is kind of weird, and
this is the right one here.",00:00:45.190,00:00:48.957
