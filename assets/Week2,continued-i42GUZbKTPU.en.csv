&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: All right.,00:00:11.280,00:00:13.650
Welcome back.,00:00:13.650,00:00:14.390
"This is Week Two of CS50, and we have
thus far been using functions but",00:00:14.390,00:00:19.260
largely taken them for granted.,00:00:19.260,00:00:20.830
"We've used printf which has the
side effect of printing",00:00:20.830,00:00:23.430
things on the screen.,00:00:23.430,00:00:24.110
"We've used get-int, get float.",00:00:24.110,00:00:25.790
"&gt;&gt; But what if you actually want to create
your own functions, as some of",00:00:25.790,00:00:29.230
"you might have already begun to
do for Problem Set One, though",00:00:29.230,00:00:31.740
not strictly required?,00:00:31.740,00:00:33.140
"Well, let's go ahead and revisit that
problem of just asking the user for",00:00:33.140,00:00:37.150
"their name and printing something on the
screen, but try to factor out some",00:00:37.150,00:00:40.660
"of the commonality that we've
seen in our code thus far.",00:00:40.660,00:00:44.000
So by that I mean the following.,00:00:44.000,00:00:45.120
"&gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and create
a new program, just call",00:00:45.120,00:00:47.315
it hello.c as usual.,00:00:47.315,00:00:49.320
"I'm going to go ahead and give myself
include standard io.h at the top.",00:00:49.320,00:00:53.730
"I'm going to also give myself
preemptively the CS50 library so that",00:00:53.730,00:00:57.040
I don't get yelled at by the compiler.,00:00:57.040,00:00:59.080
"And now I'm going to go ahead
and declare int, main, void.",00:00:59.080,00:01:02.400
"&gt;&gt; And then in here, this is where I want
to begin to outsource functionality to",00:01:02.400,00:01:09.020
"some other function that I myself am
going to write but that doesn't",00:01:09.020,00:01:12.090
currently exist.,00:01:12.090,00:01:13.820
"For instance, suppose that I wanted to
write a function that allows me to",00:01:13.820,00:01:19.210
"print out hello, comma, and
then some user's name.",00:01:19.210,00:01:23.830
"Rather than continuing to do printf
hello, %s, wouldn't it be nice if",00:01:23.830,00:01:29.010
"there were just a function called
not printf but print name?",00:01:29.010,00:01:33.380
"&gt;&gt; So in other words, I want to be able to
write a program that does a little",00:01:33.380,00:01:36.600
something like this.,00:01:36.600,00:01:37.710
"First, I'm going to say printf your
name, thereby prompting the user to",00:01:37.710,00:01:42.070
"give me his or her name, and then I'm
going to use the familiar string s to",00:01:42.070,00:01:46.150
declare a string.,00:01:46.150,00:01:47.290
"Give me a variable of type string,
call it s, and store in that the",00:01:47.290,00:01:50.420
result of calling get string.,00:01:50.420,00:01:52.120
"But now in weeks past, I would have
somewhat tediously done hello, %s/n.",00:01:52.120,00:01:56.060
"&gt;&gt; And in other words, we've seen this
example a bunch of times, and it's a",00:01:58.630,00:02:02.570
"trivial example because there's just one
line of code so it's really not a",00:02:02.570,00:02:05.280
big deal to keep typing in again.,00:02:05.280,00:02:06.860
"But suppose that this line of code
actually were becoming a burden, and",00:02:06.860,00:02:09.990
"it's not one line of code but it's 10
lines of code a couple weeks from now,",00:02:09.990,00:02:12.900
"and you're just getting tired
of copying and pasting or",00:02:12.900,00:02:15.190
retyping that same code.,00:02:15.190,00:02:17.180
"Wouldn't it be nice instead of doing
printf hello, %s and so forth,",00:02:17.180,00:02:22.100
"wouldn't it be nice if there were just
a function called print name that",00:02:22.100,00:02:26.500
takes an argument--,00:02:26.500,00:02:27.560
"in other words, it takes input--",00:02:27.560,00:02:29.120
and then semicolon.,00:02:29.120,00:02:30.620
"So that function, wouldn't it
be nice if that existed?",00:02:30.620,00:02:33.240
"Then I wouldn't have to worry about
what printf is, what %s and all of",00:02:33.240,00:02:36.690
"these complexities that are
not all that interesting.",00:02:36.690,00:02:39.400
They are useful.,00:02:39.400,00:02:40.570
"&gt;&gt; So print name, unfortunately, was not
invented some 40 plus years ago.",00:02:40.570,00:02:44.700
No one thought to write it.,00:02:44.700,00:02:45.980
"But that's the beauty of having a
programming language, just like in",00:02:45.980,00:02:48.300
"Scratch you can define custom blocks, so
in C and most any language, can you",00:02:48.300,00:02:52.930
"define your own functionality, can
you define your own functions.",00:02:52.930,00:02:57.260
"So even though we get main by
automatically for free, we can declare",00:02:57.260,00:03:01.710
our own functions.,00:03:01.710,00:03:02.730
"&gt;&gt; So I'm going to make some room up here
up top, and I'm going to declare my",00:03:02.730,00:03:05.670
"own function that's going to look a
little strange at first but we'll come",00:03:05.670,00:03:08.210
back to this before long.,00:03:08.210,00:03:09.400
"I'm going to say void, thereby
indicating this function does",00:03:09.400,00:03:12.310
"something, has a side effect, but it
doesn't return something to me in the",00:03:12.310,00:03:16.040
"same way that get int or
get string itself does.",00:03:16.040,00:03:18.810
"And I'm going to give this function a
name of print name, and I'm going to",00:03:18.810,00:03:22.450
"specify that this guy is going to take
a string, and I'm going to call that",00:03:22.450,00:03:26.470
string name.,00:03:26.470,00:03:27.600
"I could call it anything I want, but I
want my code to be self-documenting.",00:03:27.600,00:03:32.100
"In other words, if one of you were to
open this file and read it, you could",00:03:32.100,00:03:34.770
"sort of infer from the name of that
input what role it's supposed to play.",00:03:34.770,00:03:39.020
"&gt;&gt; And now below that, I'm going to open
curly brace and closed curly brace,",00:03:39.020,00:03:42.270
"and so notice I've followed the same
pattern on lines four through seven as",00:03:42.270,00:03:47.140
"I've been following for a good week plus
now between, say, lines nine and",00:03:47.140,00:03:51.622
14 which compose main.,00:03:51.622,00:03:53.400
"In other words, print name
is another function.",00:03:53.400,00:03:56.160
"Now, the compiler is not going to know
to call this thing automatically",00:03:56.160,00:03:58.990
"because I literally just invented it,
but it will know still to call main",00:03:58.990,00:04:02.670
"automatically, and then of course in
line 13, I am calling my own function.",00:04:02.670,00:04:08.710
"And because I've declared that function
up on line four before main,",00:04:08.710,00:04:12.805
"this is going to teach the compiler
what quote, unquote, ""print name""",00:04:12.805,00:04:16.579
means and what it should do.,00:04:16.579,00:04:18.140
"So I'm sort of giving it a new custom
block in the context of, say, Scratch.",00:04:18.140,00:04:22.700
"&gt;&gt; So in here, I can put that very common
or recurring pattern of code I keep",00:04:22.700,00:04:27.240
"writing in class, printf
%s hello, %s/n"",--",00:04:27.240,00:04:32.300
what do I want to put here?,00:04:36.720,00:04:37.590
S?,00:04:37.590,00:04:39.200
So I want to put name in this context.,00:04:39.200,00:04:41.420
So notice a bit of a dichotomy here.,00:04:41.420,00:04:43.440
"Because I am declaring my own function
and I have somewhat arbitrarily called",00:04:43.440,00:04:47.680
"it print name, and because I've
specified in parentheses that this",00:04:47.680,00:04:50.880
"function takes one argument, the type of
which is a string-- so it's a word",00:04:50.880,00:04:55.035
"or phrase or something like that-- and
I'm calling that argument name, that",00:04:55.035,00:05:00.010
"means the only variable that's in
scope, so to speak, is name.",00:05:00.010,00:05:04.770
"&gt;&gt; S only exists between what two
curly braces, of course?",00:05:04.770,00:05:07.780
"Well really, just like line 10 through
14, so just like on Monday cannot use",00:05:07.780,00:05:12.990
"S, but what I can do is pass
S into print name.",00:05:12.990,00:05:17.650
"Print name just so happens to give it
an alias, a synonym, a nickname,",00:05:17.650,00:05:21.030
"calling it name, and now
using it in this line.",00:05:21.030,00:05:24.400
"So now let me save this, zoom out.",00:05:24.400,00:05:26.840
&gt;&gt; Let me go ahead and make hello.,00:05:26.840,00:05:31.250
Looks good.,00:05:31.250,00:05:32.400
"Didn't spit out any errors.
./hello Enter.",00:05:32.400,00:05:36.110
What's my name?,00:05:36.110,00:05:37.020
David.,00:05:37.020,00:05:38.060
And hello David.,00:05:38.060,00:05:39.270
"So not all that exciting,
but just think now.",00:05:39.270,00:05:41.820
"You now have that same ingredient
as we did in Scratch to",00:05:41.820,00:05:44.310
make our own functions.,00:05:44.310,00:05:45.420
&gt;&gt; But there is a bit of a gotcha.,00:05:45.420,00:05:46.770
"Suppose that I hadn't really thought
this through and I actually without",00:05:46.770,00:05:50.620
"really thinking about it wrote
that function down here.",00:05:50.620,00:05:54.250
Feels perfectly reasonable.,00:05:54.250,00:05:55.420
"In Scratch there is no notion
of location in your scripts.",00:05:55.420,00:05:58.440
"You could put one up here, one up here,
one up here, and it might start",00:05:58.440,00:06:00.670
"to look a little messy if you don't
lay it out neatly, but it doesn't",00:06:00.670,00:06:03.310
"matter where physically the scripts
were on the screen.",00:06:03.310,00:06:05.910
"Unfortunately in C-- and this is unlike
languages like Java and Python",00:06:05.910,00:06:09.660
"and others that you might be familiar
with-- unfortunately in C, order does",00:06:09.660,00:06:13.600
"matter because watch what's
going to happen now.",00:06:13.600,00:06:15.830
"&gt;&gt; The default function that's going
to execute is, of course, main.",00:06:15.830,00:06:19.010
"Main is going to call print name on
line eight, but unfortunately, the",00:06:19.010,00:06:22.290
"compiler won't even know that print name
exists until it gets to line 11,",00:06:22.290,00:06:26.660
"which unfortunately is
going to be too late.",00:06:26.660,00:06:28.520
So let's do make hello.,00:06:28.520,00:06:30.660
"And now damn, two errors generated.",00:06:30.660,00:06:32.950
"So now let me scroll up to the very
first, as we should always do, and",00:06:32.950,00:06:36.050
"notice that it's yelling at me,
""implicit declaration of function",00:06:36.050,00:06:39.560
"print name.""",00:06:39.560,00:06:40.540
"&gt;&gt; So we've seen this message before,
implicit declaration of function.",00:06:40.540,00:06:43.860
When have we seen that kind of error?,00:06:43.860,00:06:48.080
When I didn't include a library.,00:06:48.080,00:06:49.180
"If I forgot cs50.h and I would get
yelled at for get string or get int.",00:06:49.180,00:06:53.470
"But in this case, this function print
name isn't in a library, right?",00:06:53.470,00:06:56.880
"It's literally in this file, so
what's really the problem?",00:06:56.880,00:07:00.230
"&gt;&gt; Well unfortunately in C, it takes you
so incredibly literally that if you",00:07:00.230,00:07:04.660
"want a function called print name to
exist, you either have to implement",00:07:04.660,00:07:08.640
"that function at the very top of your
code so that it's accessible to lower",00:07:08.640,00:07:11.940
"functions, but frankly, that becomes
sloppy very quickly.",00:07:11.940,00:07:15.070
"Personally, I like putting main first
because then it's very clear what this",00:07:15.070,00:07:18.160
program does at first glance.,00:07:18.160,00:07:19.890
"And plus, you can get into weird corner
cases where if x wants to call",00:07:19.890,00:07:23.290
"y but y might call x, you just
physically can't actually put one",00:07:23.290,00:07:27.530
above the other.,00:07:27.530,00:07:28.540
"&gt;&gt; But it turns out in C, we can
solve this very simply.",00:07:28.540,00:07:31.230
"I'm going to put a little bit of space
up here, and I'm just going to",00:07:31.230,00:07:34.010
"preemptively, albeit somewhat
redundantly, going to teach the",00:07:34.010,00:07:38.170
"compiler that there exists a function
called print name, it takes a string,",00:07:38.170,00:07:42.320
"and I'm going to call
it name semicolon.",00:07:42.320,00:07:46.330
"&gt;&gt; So this now in line four, which we
haven't seen before, is a declaration",00:07:46.330,00:07:50.220
"of a function print name, but it's only
a promise that this function will",00:07:50.220,00:07:53.940
"eventually be defined, eventually
be implemented.",00:07:53.940,00:07:56.620
"This now I can leave alone because
now this is the definition, the",00:07:56.620,00:08:00.180
"implementation, sort of the last mile
of the implementation of this",00:08:00.180,00:08:04.090
particular function.,00:08:04.090,00:08:05.130
"So frankly it's stupid, it's annoying,
but this is the way C is, and it's",00:08:05.130,00:08:08.450
"because it takes you very literally
and, as a computer frankly should,",00:08:08.450,00:08:12.050
"only does exactly what you tell it to
do, and so that ordering is important.",00:08:12.050,00:08:16.020
"&gt;&gt; So keep that in mind and again, start to
notice the recurrence of patterns.",00:08:16.020,00:08:18.940
"Odds are you will, if you haven't
already, start to encounter messages",00:08:18.940,00:08:21.850
"like this that at first glance seem
completely cryptic, but if you start",00:08:21.850,00:08:24.700
"to look for these key words like
""implicit declaration,"" mention of a",00:08:24.700,00:08:29.000
"function in this case-- and frankly, you
sometimes even get a little green",00:08:29.000,00:08:32.380
"carrot symbol that tells you where
the issue probably is--",00:08:32.380,00:08:35.010
"you can begin to work your way through
yet unseen error messages.",00:08:35.010,00:08:40.980
"Any questions on writing your
own function in this way?",00:08:40.980,00:08:45.860
"&gt;&gt; Let's do something that's a
little more compelling.",00:08:45.860,00:08:47.540
"Rather than just do something that has
a side effect of printing, let me go",00:08:47.540,00:08:51.760
"ahead and save a new file, and we'll
call this positive.c, even though it's",00:08:51.760,00:08:55.340
"going to be a little different
versus last time.",00:08:55.340,00:08:57.600
"And this time, I want to re-implement
last time's positive.C example, which",00:08:57.600,00:09:01.910
"is force the user to give
me a positive integer.",00:09:01.910,00:09:04.430
But I had to use get int last time.,00:09:04.430,00:09:07.280
"Wouldn't it have been nice if there was
a function called get positive int",00:09:07.280,00:09:10.780
"that I could just outsource this
piece of functionality to?",00:09:10.780,00:09:13.610
"So the difference here is we'll
implement get positive int, but unlike",00:09:13.610,00:09:16.480
"print name which had a side effect-- it
didn't return something to me like",00:09:16.480,00:09:20.330
a number or a string--,00:09:20.330,00:09:21.710
"get positive int is, of course, going to
return, hopefully, a positive int.",00:09:21.710,00:09:25.510
&gt;&gt; So let's do this.,00:09:25.510,00:09:26.170
"Include cs50.h, Include standard io.h.",00:09:26.170,00:09:30.840
Int main void.,00:09:30.840,00:09:33.520
"And now in here, I'm going to go ahead
and let's say int, call it n, equals",00:09:33.520,00:09:42.160
get positive int.,00:09:42.160,00:09:44.270
"And just like get int already exists
because the staff wrote it, I'm going",00:09:44.270,00:09:49.080
"to assume for the moment that get
positive int exists, and now I'm going",00:09:49.080,00:09:53.950
"to go ahead and say printf,
thanks for the %i/n"",n.",00:09:53.950,00:09:57.730
"&gt;&gt; So now if I compile this program, what
is going to happen in my terminal",00:10:02.940,00:10:07.770
window at the bottom of the screen?,00:10:07.770,00:10:09.075
"I'm going to probably get that
same error as before.",00:10:11.580,00:10:13.900
So let's try this.,00:10:13.900,00:10:14.570
Make positive.,00:10:14.570,00:10:16.450
"And again, implicit declaration
of function, get positive int.",00:10:16.450,00:10:19.900
"So we can solve this in
a couple of ways.",00:10:19.900,00:10:21.970
"I'm going to keep it simple and just
put my declaration up here and get",00:10:21.970,00:10:27.310
positive int.,00:10:27.310,00:10:28.120
I need the so-called signature.,00:10:28.120,00:10:29.720
"The signature just refers
to the aesthetics of the",00:10:29.720,00:10:32.410
first line of the program.,00:10:32.410,00:10:34.090
"So what should get positive
int return?",00:10:34.090,00:10:37.420
&gt;&gt; So an int.,00:10:37.420,00:10:37.970
"I mean ideally, it would return
something like positive int, but that",00:10:37.970,00:10:41.540
doesn't exist.,00:10:41.540,00:10:42.160
"We've not seen that among our data
types, so we have to deal with the",00:10:42.160,00:10:45.280
"fact that we have very few
data types to work with.",00:10:45.280,00:10:47.170
"But we can return an int and just
trust that it will be positive.",00:10:47.170,00:10:50.360
"It's going to be called
get positive int.",00:10:50.360,00:10:52.690
&gt;&gt; And now how about its arguments?,00:10:52.690,00:10:55.122
Does it take any input?,00:10:55.122,00:10:56.440
Does it need any input?,00:10:56.440,00:10:58.280
"So it doesn't need to know
in advance anything.",00:10:58.280,00:11:00.900
"Get string doesn't, get int doesn't.",00:11:00.900,00:11:03.220
"Printf does-- it needs to have some
input passed into it-- and print name",00:11:03.220,00:11:06.430
"needed some input, but get
positive int does not.",00:11:06.430,00:11:09.020
"So I'm going to explicitly
tell the compiler void.",00:11:09.020,00:11:11.530
Void is the absence of anything else.,00:11:11.530,00:11:13.470
"So void means nothing is going inside
of those parentheses, semicolon.",00:11:13.470,00:11:17.990
"&gt;&gt; And now at the bottom of my file-- and
again, I'm just being kind of anal",00:11:17.990,00:11:20.840
"here putting main at the top, which
is good practice because this way,",00:11:20.840,00:11:23.640
"anytime you or someone else
opens your file, the",00:11:23.640,00:11:26.220
functionality is right there.,00:11:26.220,00:11:27.400
You can dive in from square one.,00:11:27.400,00:11:29.660
"So now I'm going to duplicate this,
get positive int void, but I'm not",00:11:29.660,00:11:34.190
going to hit a semicolon now.,00:11:34.190,00:11:35.430
"I'm going to open curly braces,
and now I need to borrow",00:11:35.430,00:11:38.280
some ideas from Monday.,00:11:38.280,00:11:39.700
"&gt;&gt; So as you recall, we did something
like do the following while",00:11:39.700,00:11:44.450
something was true.,00:11:44.450,00:11:45.830
And what did I do?,00:11:45.830,00:11:46.630
"I did something like give
me a positive integer,",00:11:46.630,00:11:51.540
little bit of a prompt.,00:11:51.540,00:11:52.430
I could use any words I want.,00:11:52.430,00:11:53.540
And then I used what?,00:11:53.540,00:11:54.960
"Int n equals get int,
no arguments to it.",00:11:54.960,00:11:59.530
&gt;&gt; And notice the difference.,00:11:59.530,00:12:00.550
"When you call a function, when you use
a function, you don't put in void.",00:12:00.550,00:12:04.680
"You only do that when declaring a
function, teaching the compiler what",00:12:04.680,00:12:08.570
it should expect.,00:12:08.570,00:12:09.780
"So you don't need to put
void there yourself.",00:12:09.780,00:12:11.650
&gt;&gt; And now what was my condition?,00:12:11.650,00:12:12.940
"Well, n is not equal to positive,
but that's just pseudo-code.",00:12:12.940,00:12:19.670
So how do I express this more cleanly?,00:12:19.670,00:12:22.530
So less than or equal to zero.,00:12:22.530,00:12:24.090
"So again, notice you can do
less than or equal to.",00:12:24.090,00:12:26.250
"Even though it's two separate
symbols, you can do it on",00:12:26.250,00:12:28.100
your keyboard as such.,00:12:28.100,00:12:29.350
"&gt;&gt; But there's still a bug that
I screwed up last time too.",00:12:29.350,00:12:33.950
I have to declare--,00:12:33.950,00:12:36.950
exactly.,00:12:36.950,00:12:37.460
"I have to declare n outside
of the loop.",00:12:37.460,00:12:39.640
"So I need to put n up here, and I don't
want to re-declare it in here",00:12:39.640,00:12:44.180
lest I get a new variable.,00:12:44.180,00:12:46.480
I just want to assign a value in here.,00:12:46.480,00:12:48.860
&gt;&gt; And now I'm not quite done here.,00:12:48.860,00:12:54.320
"Let me get ahead of myself
and pretend I'm done.",00:12:54.320,00:12:57.290
"Make positive, and now
there's a new error.",00:12:57.290,00:13:01.220
"Control reaches end of
non-void function.",00:13:01.220,00:13:04.550
"So new error message, but if you kind
of tease apart each of the words, it",00:13:04.550,00:13:07.760
probably hints at what's wrong.,00:13:07.760,00:13:09.620
&gt;&gt; Control.,00:13:09.620,00:13:11.240
"Control just means to the order
of operations in a program.",00:13:11.240,00:13:14.250
"The computer's in control and
something went wrong.",00:13:14.250,00:13:16.510
"So it reaches the end of
a non-void function.",00:13:16.510,00:13:18.510
"What function is it apparently
referring to?",00:13:18.510,00:13:21.760
What function is non-void?,00:13:21.760,00:13:24.790
"So get positive int, and a little
confusing in that well,",00:13:24.790,00:13:27.400
it's kind of void.,00:13:27.400,00:13:29.010
"It has a specification of void for its
arguments, but its output is going to",00:13:29.010,00:13:33.070
be of type n.,00:13:33.070,00:13:34.540
"So the word on the left is the
so-called return type.",00:13:34.540,00:13:37.260
"The word on the inside here is
the zero or more arguments",00:13:37.260,00:13:40.320
that a function takes.,00:13:40.320,00:13:41.970
&gt;&gt; So what do I need to do?,00:13:41.970,00:13:44.060
"At this point in my code, line 21 where
the blinking prompt now is, I",00:13:44.060,00:13:47.650
"have a positive int inside
of the variable called n.",00:13:47.650,00:13:51.430
How do I give it back to main?,00:13:51.430,00:13:55.200
Literally.,00:13:55.200,00:13:55.960
Return n semicolon.,00:13:55.960,00:13:59.320
"&gt;&gt; So just as Colton returned a piece of
paper with an answer to me by dropping",00:13:59.320,00:14:04.090
"that piece of paper in the little black
box on the table, to do that in",00:14:04.090,00:14:07.020
"code, you literally just write, return
n, and it's as though Colton were",00:14:07.020,00:14:10.100
handing me something physical back.,00:14:10.100,00:14:12.140
"In this case, what's happening is get
positive int is going to hand back",00:14:12.140,00:14:15.870
"what's presumably a positive
integer to whom?",00:14:15.870,00:14:19.220
Where does that value end up?,00:14:19.220,00:14:21.380
"That ends up in this variable, n, and
then we proceed with line nine.",00:14:21.380,00:14:29.080
"&gt;&gt; So in other words, in order of
operations, this program starts",00:14:29.080,00:14:31.920
"executing, and the compiler realizes,
oh, you want the library?",00:14:31.920,00:14:34.430
Let me go grab whatever's inside that.,00:14:34.430,00:14:36.310
"Oh, you want the standard IO library?",00:14:36.310,00:14:37.750
Let me go grab whatever's inside that.,00:14:37.750,00:14:39.660
"What does the compiler say to itself
when it hits line four?",00:14:39.660,00:14:44.510
"Oh, you promised to implement the
function called get positive, but",00:14:44.510,00:14:47.980
"we'll get back to that later,
something along those lines.",00:14:47.980,00:14:50.820
"&gt;&gt; Int main void just means here's
the guts of my program.",00:14:50.820,00:14:53.450
Line seven is just a curly brace.,00:14:53.450,00:14:54.990

me 32 bits for an integer, call it n.",00:14:54.990,00:14:59.540

I don't keep moving my cursor down.",00:15:02.160,00:15:07.120

"&gt;&gt; Get an int from the user, store it in n,
and maybe do this again and again.",00:15:16.090,00:15:19.740

cooperates and gives me a positive",00:15:23.010,00:15:25.810
"int, I hit line 21, at which point the

Nine.,00:15:34.280,00:15:35.070
"Control, so to speak, returns

this time underneath the hood, but",00:15:40.650,00:15:43.250

has now returned.",00:16:13.370,00:16:18.100

"Oh, good question.",00:16:26.130,00:16:27.860
"So you might notice a parallel here that
I'm kind of cutting a corner on.",00:16:27.860,00:16:31.100
"In line 12, I'm saying, get positive int
returns an int, but by that same",00:16:31.100,00:16:35.420

happening for you automatically.",00:16:49.970,00:16:55.750

zero signifies h, bracket one",00:19:18.980,00:19:22.840
"signifies e, and so forth.",00:19:22.840,00:19:25.170
"And so all the time when we've been
using strings and typing in ""hello""",00:19:25.170,00:19:28.490

in boxes like this.,00:19:31.250,00:19:32.820
And take a guess.,00:19:32.820,00:19:33.370

&gt;&gt; Sorry?,00:19:38.250,00:19:39.150
&gt;&gt; Characters.,00:19:39.150,00:19:39.580
"&gt;&gt; So a character, certainly in the case
of strings, and a character is just",00:19:39.580,00:19:44.760
eight bits or one byte.,00:19:44.760,00:19:46.800
"So you probably are at least vaguely
familiar with the fact that your",00:19:46.800,00:19:49.550
computer has memory.,00:19:49.550,00:19:50.500
It has two types of memory at least.,00:19:50.500,00:19:52.110
"One is the hard disk where you save
stuff permanently, and that's",00:19:52.110,00:19:54.810
"typically big so you can have movies
and music and so forth.",00:19:54.810,00:19:57.400
"&gt;&gt; Then you have another type of memory
called RAM, R-A-M, Random Access",00:19:57.400,00:20:04.010
"Memory, and this is the type of memory
that is used when your computer is",00:20:04.010,00:20:07.510
"running but if you lose power or your
battery dies, anything that's stored",00:20:07.510,00:20:11.520
"in RAM disappears if you lose power
altogether because it's not",00:20:11.520,00:20:15.300
persistent.,00:20:15.300,00:20:16.060
"You typically have, these days, a
gig of it, two gigs, maybe more.",00:20:16.060,00:20:19.120
"And the upside of RAM is that it's much
much, much faster than hard disks",00:20:19.120,00:20:23.490
"or even solid state drives these days,
but it's typically more expensive so",00:20:23.490,00:20:27.390
you have less of it.,00:20:27.390,00:20:28.480
"&gt;&gt; So today's conversation really refers
to RAM, that type of memory that",00:20:28.480,00:20:32.400
"exists only while there's power
being fed into your computer.",00:20:32.400,00:20:35.270
"So when you type in H-E-L-L-O, Enter on
the keyboard, the H is going in one",00:20:35.270,00:20:40.530
"byte of RAM, the E is going in
another byte of RAM, as is",00:20:40.530,00:20:44.550
the rest of the word.,00:20:44.550,00:20:45.800
"So recall what we were able
to do last time was this.",00:20:45.800,00:20:49.010
"Let me go ahead and open up the file
that we called string.c, and recall",00:20:49.010,00:20:53.940
"that it looked a little
something like this.",00:20:53.940,00:20:56.860
"Let me actually roll back and change
it to exactly what it looked like,",00:20:56.860,00:20:59.860
string length of s.,00:20:59.860,00:21:02.654
&gt;&gt; So look at the program here.,00:21:02.654,00:21:04.560
"We include the CS50 library so
that we can use get string.",00:21:04.560,00:21:08.530
"We include standard io.h
so we can use printf.",00:21:08.530,00:21:11.400
Why did we include string.h?,00:21:11.400,00:21:13.580
This was new on Monday.,00:21:13.580,00:21:16.980
So we wanted string length.,00:21:16.980,00:21:18.230
Str leng.,00:21:18.230,00:21:19.090
"People decided years ago,
let's just be succinct.",00:21:19.090,00:21:21.470
"Instead of calling it ""string length,""
let's call it ""str leng"" and let the",00:21:21.470,00:21:24.290
"world figure that out, and so that's
what we get access to with string.h.",00:21:24.290,00:21:28.540
&gt;&gt; This is familiar.,00:21:28.540,00:21:29.390
This is familiar.,00:21:29.390,00:21:30.320
This is familiar.,00:21:30.320,00:21:31.450
This is a little new.,00:21:31.450,00:21:32.370
"In line 22-- and we'll come back
to this, but for now know--",00:21:32.370,00:21:35.420
"and you would only know this from having
read the documentation or if",00:21:35.420,00:21:37.880
you knew C already--,00:21:37.880,00:21:39.010
get string sometimes can screw up.,00:21:39.010,00:21:41.510
"If the user is really adversarial or
uncooperative and he or she just",00:21:41.510,00:21:45.130
"doesn't type anything at the keyboard or
types so much at the keyboard that",00:21:45.130,00:21:49.450
"it overwhelms the computer's memory,
in theory, get string could return",00:21:49.450,00:21:53.760
"something other than a
string of characters.",00:21:53.760,00:21:56.270
"It could return a special value called
NULL in all caps, N-U-L-L, and this is",00:21:56.270,00:22:01.930
just a so-called sentinel value.,00:22:01.930,00:22:03.390
"It's a special value that signifies
something bad happened in this case.",00:22:03.390,00:22:08.010
It is the absence of a string.,00:22:08.010,00:22:10.520
"&gt;&gt; So null I'm checking for simply so that,
long story short, str leng and",00:22:10.520,00:22:16.190
"other functions that come with C, if
they expect a string but you pass them",00:22:16.190,00:22:20.230
"the absence of a string, if you pass
them NULL, the computer or the program",00:22:20.230,00:22:23.630
will just crash outright.,00:22:23.630,00:22:25.000
It will hang.,00:22:25.000,00:22:25.610
It will throw up some error message.,00:22:25.610,00:22:27.250
Bad things will happen.,00:22:27.250,00:22:28.690
"So even though this is still
not well-defined--",00:22:28.690,00:22:31.130
"this will make more sense in a week or
two-- in line 22, this is just an",00:22:31.130,00:22:33.730
"example of self defensive error checking

"a million something goes wrong, at
least my program won't crash.",00:22:38.790,00:22:42.040
"&gt;&gt; So if s does not equals something bad,
I have this for loop, and this was",00:22:42.040,00:22:45.960
"where we had that other
new piece of syntax.",00:22:45.960,00:22:47.710
"I have a for loop iterating from
zero on up to the length of s.",00:22:47.710,00:22:51.580
"And then here, I was a printing out s
bracket i, but why did I use %c all of",00:22:51.580,00:22:56.140
"a sudden instead of %s even
though s is a string?",00:22:56.140,00:23:00.770
"It's a character, right?",00:23:00.770,00:23:02.110
"S is a string, but s bracket something,
s bracket i where i is zero",00:23:02.110,00:23:06.560
"or one or two, that's an individual
character in the string, and so for",00:23:06.560,00:23:10.380
"that, printf needs to be informed that
it's indeed a character to expect.",00:23:10.380,00:23:14.970
"&gt;&gt; And then recall, what did this
program actually do?",00:23:14.970,00:23:18.096
&gt;&gt; Printed it out in columns.,00:23:18.096,00:23:19.848
"&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.",00:23:19.848,00:23:21.120
"It just printed the word that I type in
a column, one character per line.",00:23:21.120,00:23:24.990
So let's see this again.,00:23:24.990,00:23:26.190
So make string.,00:23:26.190,00:23:27.810
Compiled OK. ./string.,00:23:27.810,00:23:30.200
"Let me type in H-E-L-L-O, Enter, and
indeed I get it, one per line.",00:23:30.200,00:23:35.560
&gt;&gt; So let me do one optimization here.,00:23:35.560,00:23:37.280
"If you think about it, especially if
you've programmed before, there's",00:23:37.280,00:23:40.240
arguably an inefficiency in line 24.,00:23:40.240,00:23:43.340
"In other words, it's not necessarily
the best design.",00:23:43.340,00:23:46.160
"Straightforward, at least once you
remember what str leng is, but it's",00:23:46.160,00:23:50.200
doing something dumb potentially.,00:23:50.200,00:23:52.640
What might that be?,00:23:52.640,00:23:54.863
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].,00:23:54.863,00:23:56.280
&gt;&gt; Exactly.,00:23:56.280,00:23:56.800
"It's checking for the length of s
every single time even though",00:23:56.800,00:24:00.340
"H-E-L-L-O is always going
to be five characters.",00:24:00.340,00:24:02.980
"Every time through this loop,
the five is not changing.",00:24:02.980,00:24:05.490
"I might be incrementing i, but what
is the length of s on every",00:24:05.490,00:24:08.750
iteration of this loop?,00:24:08.750,00:24:09.690
"It's five, it's five, it's five, and
yet I am nonetheless asking this",00:24:09.690,00:24:15.810
question again and again and again.,00:24:15.810,00:24:18.320
"Now frankly, the computer is so damn
fast, no one's going to notice a",00:24:18.320,00:24:20.750
"difference in this case, but these kinds
of poor design decisions can",00:24:20.750,00:24:23.780
"start to add up if the compiler itself
doesn't try to fix this for you which",00:24:23.780,00:24:28.330
"it typically wouldn't, at
least in the appliance.",00:24:28.330,00:24:30.630
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to do this.,00:24:30.630,00:24:31.540
"I'm going to add a comma after
my first variable, i.",00:24:31.540,00:24:34.580
"I'm going to give myself another
variable, calling it n, just by",00:24:34.580,00:24:37.310
"convention for numbers, and then I'm
going to assign n the value of string",00:24:37.310,00:24:41.330
length of s.,00:24:41.330,00:24:42.530
"And then I'm going to change
my condition to be what?",00:24:42.530,00:24:46.060
"I'm going to change my condition
to while i is less than n.",00:24:46.060,00:24:51.960
"&gt;&gt; So now, how many times am I
checking the length of s?",00:24:51.960,00:24:55.700
"Once, but it's OK to check i against
n again and again because now those",00:24:55.700,00:25:00.110
values are not actually changing.,00:25:00.110,00:25:03.170
"Now for now, just know that anytime you
call a function, there's a bit of",00:25:03.170,00:25:06.020
"overhead, not enough to discourage you
really from ever using functions, but",00:25:06.020,00:25:09.930
"certainly when there's a line of code
like that-- and the lines will get",00:25:09.930,00:25:12.750
"more interesting before long-- where
there's an opportunity to think, if I",00:25:12.750,00:25:15.490
"type this code, how many
times will it execute?",00:25:15.490,00:25:18.320
"You'll start to see over time the
performance of your programs can",00:25:18.320,00:25:20.950
indeed change.,00:25:20.950,00:25:21.660
"&gt;&gt; In fact, one of the problem sets we've
done in years past involves",00:25:21.660,00:25:24.110
"implementing, as you may recall from
week zero, a spell checker, but a",00:25:24.110,00:25:27.600
"spell checker that's designed to support
a dictionary of 150,000 plus",00:25:27.600,00:25:31.380
words that we give you guys.,00:25:31.380,00:25:32.860
"You would have to write code that loads
those words into RAM, so into",00:25:32.860,00:25:37.100
"boxes like we saw on the screen a moment
ago, and then as fast as you",00:25:37.100,00:25:40.700
"can, you need to be able to answer a
question of the form, is this word",00:25:40.700,00:25:43.740
misspelled?,00:25:43.740,00:25:44.280
Is this word misspelled?,00:25:44.280,00:25:45.420
Is this word misspelled?,00:25:45.420,00:25:46.770
"&gt;&gt; And in something like that what we've
done in years past is turned it into,",00:25:46.770,00:25:49.525
"albeit on an opt-in optional basis, a
competition of sorts, whereby the",00:25:49.525,00:25:53.500
"students who use the less RAM and less
time, fewer CPU cycles, end up",00:25:53.500,00:25:59.470

"the course's homepage as we've
done in years past.",00:26:02.640,00:26:04.770
"So again, totally optional, but this
speaks to the design opportunities",00:26:04.770,00:26:08.100
"that are ahead once we start
building atop some of these",00:26:08.100,00:26:11.250

"&gt;&gt; So let me go back to this diagram for
just a moment and reveal a little",00:26:14.010,00:26:16.780
something more.,00:26:16.780,00:26:17.610

advantage of a few libraries,",00:26:17.610,00:26:21.400

files that declare functions",00:26:34.800,00:26:38.540

let the computer remember it",00:28:34.520,00:28:36.980
rather than me the human.,00:28:36.980,00:28:38.240
"&gt;&gt; So lowercase a minus capital A is
going to give me a difference.",00:28:38.240,00:28:41.710
"It happens to be 32, and that would be
the case for lowercase b and capital B",00:28:41.710,00:28:45.370
and so forth.,00:28:45.370,00:28:45.930
"It stays consistent, thankfully.",00:28:45.930,00:28:47.710
"So I'm essentially saying, take the
lowercase letter, subtract off that",00:28:47.710,00:28:51.930
"standard difference, and that
effectively changes s bracket i from",00:28:51.930,00:28:55.340
"lowercase to, of course, uppercase,
without my really having to think",00:28:55.340,00:28:59.400
"about or remember, what were those
numbers we talked about when the eight",00:28:59.400,00:29:03.040
volunteers came up on stage?,00:29:03.040,00:29:04.800
"Now meanwhile, in the else, if it's not
a lowercase letter as determined",00:29:04.800,00:29:08.800
"by line 24, just print it out.",00:29:08.800,00:29:10.400
"I only want to touch the
characters that were",00:29:10.400,00:29:12.590
actually originally lowercase.,00:29:12.590,00:29:14.410
&gt;&gt; So let's see this.,00:29:14.410,00:29:15.150
Make capitalize.,00:29:15.150,00:29:17.400
"Compiled, OK.",00:29:17.400,00:29:18.470
./capitalize.,00:29:18.470,00:29:19.730
"And let me type in H-E-L-L-O
in lowercase, Enter.",00:29:19.730,00:29:23.530
"And notice that it is converted
into uppercase.",00:29:23.530,00:29:26.370
"Let me do this again with
a different word.",00:29:26.370,00:29:27.940
"How about D-A-V-I-D with the first D
capitalized as a name typically is?",00:29:27.940,00:29:32.720
Enter.,00:29:32.720,00:29:33.560
Notice it's still correct.,00:29:33.560,00:29:34.870
"It just outputted that first D unchanged
via that else construct.",00:29:34.870,00:29:40.250
"&gt;&gt; So keep in mind, then, a
couple of things here.",00:29:40.250,00:29:42.170
"One, if you ever want to check two
conditions at once, you can and them",00:29:42.170,00:29:45.060
together as we predicted.,00:29:45.060,00:29:46.500
"You can compare characters in this way
and effectively treat characters as",00:29:46.500,00:29:49.900
"numbers, but frankly, this is so damn
cryptic I'm never going to remember",00:29:49.900,00:29:53.050
"how to come up with this from scratch
without reasoning through it for quite",00:29:53.050,00:29:56.510
a bit of time.,00:29:56.510,00:29:57.140
"&gt;&gt; Wouldn't it have been nice if someone
out there wrote a function called is",00:29:57.140,00:30:00.590
"lower that could answer for me true or
false, this character is lowercase?",00:30:00.590,00:30:05.390
"Well thankfully, whoever wrote
ctype.h did exactly that.",00:30:05.390,00:30:09.350
"Let me go up here and add ctype for c
types, and now let me go down here and",00:30:09.350,00:30:15.540
rewrite this line as follows.,00:30:15.540,00:30:18.820
"&gt;&gt; So if it's called is lower, I claim, s
bracket i, then I'm going to delete",00:30:18.820,00:30:27.510
these two lines altogether.,00:30:27.510,00:30:29.400
"So now someone else, I'm hoping, wrote
a function called is lower, and it",00:30:29.400,00:30:32.570
"turns out they did and they declared
it inside of ctype.h.",00:30:32.570,00:30:36.250
"And now I'm going to leave line 27
alone, I'm going to leave line 31",00:30:36.250,00:30:39.480
"alone, but notice how much I've
tightened up my code.",00:30:39.480,00:30:41.890
It's now cleaner.,00:30:41.890,00:30:42.690
"It's less difficult to look through
because now the function, moreover, is",00:30:42.690,00:30:47.250
"so wonderfully named it just
does what it says.",00:30:47.250,00:30:50.080
&gt;&gt; So now I'm going to save this.,00:30:50.080,00:30:51.520
I'm going to zoom out.,00:30:51.520,00:30:52.930
"And just as in Scratch you could have
Booleans, Boolean values true or",00:30:52.930,00:30:56.650
"false, that's exactly what is
lower effectively returns.",00:30:56.650,00:31:01.530
Let me recompile.,00:31:01.530,00:31:02.960
Let me re-run.,00:31:02.960,00:31:04.500
"And now let's try it again,
H-E-L-L-O, Enter.",00:31:04.500,00:31:07.350
That's pretty good.,00:31:07.350,00:31:07.970
"And try it again, make sure I
didn't screw something up.",00:31:07.970,00:31:10.150
That is capitalized as well.,00:31:10.150,00:31:11.670
"&gt;&gt; But this isn't good enough because the
other thing that I'm never going to",00:31:11.670,00:31:14.190
"remember unless I work through it really
carefully on, say, paper is",00:31:14.190,00:31:19.090
this damn line.,00:31:19.090,00:31:19.920
"Wouldn't it be nice if there were
a function called to upper?",00:31:19.920,00:31:23.450
"Well it turns out there
is in ctype.h as well.",00:31:23.450,00:31:26.930
I'm going to go ahead and type--,00:31:26.930,00:31:30.150
let me bring that line back.,00:31:30.150,00:31:31.340
"Instead of this here, let me go ahead
and say, substitute for the %c the",00:31:31.340,00:31:36.430
"result of calling this function to
upper on the i-th character of s.",00:31:36.430,00:31:42.110
"And now notice it's getting
a little balanced.",00:31:42.110,00:31:45.430
"I have to keep track of how many
parentheses I've opened and closed.",00:31:45.430,00:31:48.870
&gt;&gt; So now it's even cleaner.,00:31:48.870,00:31:50.050
"Now this program is getting better and
better designed arguably because it's",00:31:50.050,00:31:53.460
"much, much more readable but
it's no let's correct.",00:31:53.460,00:31:56.450
Make capitalize.,00:31:56.450,00:31:57.600
./capitalize.,00:31:57.600,00:31:58.930
"H-E-L-L-O. Let's run it again,
D-A-V-I-D. OK, so we're still in",00:31:58.930,00:32:03.220
pretty good shape.,00:32:03.220,00:32:04.250
&gt;&gt; But now to upper.,00:32:04.250,00:32:06.030
"I propose that there's one more
refinement we could make that would be",00:32:06.030,00:32:09.720
"really nice, that could really tighten
up this code and really give us five",00:32:09.720,00:32:12.820
"out of five for design, for instance.",00:32:12.820,00:32:15.150
What would be nice to get rid of?,00:32:15.150,00:32:16.510
"Well, look how damn long this block of
code is just to do something simple.",00:32:16.510,00:32:20.770
"&gt;&gt; Now as an aside, as you might have
seen in super section this past",00:32:20.770,00:32:23.850
"weekend, you don't strictly need the
curly braces when you just have one",00:32:23.850,00:32:27.570
"line of code, even though we proposed
keeping them so that it makes much",00:32:27.570,00:32:32.180
"more clear, like in Scratch's U-shaped
blocks, what's inside of the branch.",00:32:32.180,00:32:36.190
"But wouldn't it be nice if to upper,
when given its input, turned it into",00:32:36.190,00:32:40.170
"uppercase if it's not, and what would
be wonderful in the opposite case if",00:32:40.170,00:32:44.730
it's already uppercase?,00:32:44.730,00:32:47.210
"Just pass it through
and leave it alone.",00:32:47.210,00:32:49.620
&gt;&gt; So maybe it does that.,00:32:49.620,00:32:50.660
"I could try and just hope
that it does, but let me",00:32:50.660,00:32:52.990
introduce one other thing.,00:32:52.990,00:32:54.450
"Instead of using this built-in terminal
window down here, recall that",00:32:54.450,00:32:57.440
"this square black icon gives you a
bigger terminal window that I can full",00:32:57.440,00:33:01.130
screen if I want?,00:33:01.130,00:33:02.260
"So it turns out they're sort of oddly
named, but there's these things called",00:33:02.260,00:33:05.820
"man pages, manual pages, man for short,
and I can access these by",00:33:05.820,00:33:10.970
typing man--,00:33:10.970,00:33:14.515
what do I want to type?,00:33:14.515,00:33:15.570
Man to upper.,00:33:15.570,00:33:17.830
"&gt;&gt; And now notice if there exists a
function inside of the computer, in",00:33:17.830,00:33:21.090
"this case the appliance, which is just
the operating system Linux, it's going",00:33:21.090,00:33:23.970
"to give me a somewhat cryptic set of
output, but you'll find over time that",00:33:23.970,00:33:27.920
"it always is formatted pretty much the
same so you start to get used to it.",00:33:27.920,00:33:31.720
"Notice at the top to upper, and
apparently is the same documentation",00:33:31.720,00:33:35.130
for to lower.,00:33:35.130,00:33:35.680
"Whoever wrote it was cutting some
corners and put it all on one page.",00:33:35.680,00:33:38.740
"These things' purpose in
life is to convert a",00:33:38.740,00:33:40.720
letter to upper or lowercase.,00:33:40.720,00:33:42.780
"&gt;&gt; Notice that under Synopsis, the man page
is teaching me what file I have",00:33:42.780,00:33:46.290
to include to use this thing.,00:33:46.290,00:33:48.130
"It's giving me the signatures for these
functions, both of them, even",00:33:48.130,00:33:51.320
"though we right now only
care about one.",00:33:51.320,00:33:53.510
Here is now a description.,00:33:53.510,00:33:54.730
"To upper converts the letter
c to uppercase if possible.",00:33:54.730,00:33:58.800
"&gt;&gt; Still not that instructive, but let me
now look under return value, the thing",00:33:58.800,00:34:02.280
that's handed back.,00:34:02.280,00:34:03.520
"So the value returned is that of the
converted letter or c if the",00:34:03.520,00:34:08.600
conversion was not possible.,00:34:08.600,00:34:09.870
What is c?,00:34:09.870,00:34:11.202
&gt;&gt; The original character.,00:34:11.202,00:34:12.560
"&gt;&gt; The original character and we know
that by, again, going up to the",00:34:12.560,00:34:15.370
"synopsis, and whoever wrote this
function just decided that the input",00:34:15.370,00:34:19.179
"to to upper and to lower is just
arbitrarily going to be called c.",00:34:19.179,00:34:22.909
"They could have called it most anything
they want, but they kept it",00:34:22.909,00:34:24.909
simple as c.,00:34:24.909,00:34:26.270
So I've consulted the man page.,00:34:26.270,00:34:27.880
"This sentence reassures me that if
it's not a lowercase letter, it's",00:34:27.880,00:34:31.870
"going to just give me back c, which is
perfect, which means I can get rid of",00:34:31.870,00:34:34.969
my else condition.,00:34:34.969,00:34:36.199
"&gt;&gt; So let me go back to GEdit, and
now let me just do this.",00:34:36.199,00:34:39.679
I'm going to copy my printf statement.,00:34:39.679,00:34:41.960
"I'm going to go ahead and right inside
the for loop print that out, and get",00:34:41.960,00:34:45.969
rid of now this whole if construct.,00:34:45.969,00:34:48.760
"Wasn't a bad idea, and it was very
much correct and consistent with",00:34:48.760,00:34:51.860
"everything we've preached,
but just not necessary.",00:34:51.860,00:34:54.100
"As soon as you realize some library
function exists that someone else",00:34:54.100,00:34:57.070
"wrote, or maybe you wrote elsewhere in
the file, you can use it and really",00:34:57.070,00:35:01.340
start to tighten up the code.,00:35:01.340,00:35:02.690
"&gt;&gt; And when I say things like good style,
the fact that this person called the",00:35:02.690,00:35:06.080
"function to upper, or previously is
lower is wonderfully useful because",00:35:06.080,00:35:11.490
they're very descriptive.,00:35:11.490,00:35:12.900
"You wouldn't want to call your functions
x and y and z, which have",00:35:12.900,00:35:16.120
"much, much less meaning.",00:35:16.120,00:35:19.620
"Any questions on that series
of improvements?",00:35:19.620,00:35:25.160
"&gt;&gt; So suffice it to say one of the
takeaways is even as your own problem",00:35:25.160,00:35:28.010
"set-- maybe problem set one, but
certainly P set two and onward, even",00:35:28.010,00:35:30.960
"when they're correct doesn't necessarily
mean they are perfect just",00:35:30.960,00:35:34.380
yet or particularly well-designed.,00:35:34.380,00:35:36.155
"That's the other axis to
start thinking about.",00:35:36.155,00:35:38.420
"So this was a string inside of your
computer's memory, but if you have a",00:35:38.420,00:35:41.730
"whole bunch of characters like H-E-L-L-O
inside of RAM, and suppose",00:35:41.730,00:35:46.180
"that you in your program call get string
multiple times such that you",00:35:46.180,00:35:51.330
"call get string once, then you
call get string again.",00:35:51.330,00:35:54.200
"Well, what's going to
happen over time?",00:35:54.200,00:35:55.880
"&gt;&gt; In other words, if you have a line of
code, albeit out of context, like",00:35:55.880,00:35:59.170
string s gets--,00:35:59.170,00:36:02.120
let's do this.,00:36:02.120,00:36:02.960
String name equals get string.,00:36:02.960,00:36:05.270
"So suppose that line of code is meant
to ask the user for his or her name.",00:36:05.270,00:36:08.590
"This next line of code is meant to ask
the user for his or her school, and",00:36:08.590,00:36:14.580
"this next line, and so forth.",00:36:14.580,00:36:15.920
"Suppose that we keep asking
the user for another and",00:36:15.920,00:36:18.150
another and another string.,00:36:18.150,00:36:19.750
"They're going to stay in memory
at the same time.",00:36:19.750,00:36:22.390
One is not going to clobber the other.,00:36:22.390,00:36:24.280
School is not overwrite the other.,00:36:24.280,00:36:26.420
"But where do they all
end up in memory?",00:36:26.420,00:36:28.520
"&gt;&gt; Well, if we start to draw on the screen,
which we can use this thing",00:36:28.520,00:36:32.030
"here like a chalkboard, if this black
rectangle represents my computer's",00:36:32.030,00:36:35.800
"memory, I'm going to arbitrarily start
dividing it up into little squares,",00:36:35.800,00:36:39.800
"each of which represents
one byte of memory.",00:36:39.800,00:36:42.120
"Frankly, if you have a gigabyte of RAM
these days, you have a billion bytes",00:36:42.120,00:36:46.560
"of memory in your computer, so
a billion of these squares.",00:36:46.560,00:36:49.540
"So suffice it to say, this
isn't really to scale.",00:36:49.540,00:36:52.110
"&gt;&gt; But we could keep drawing all of these
clearly not to scale squares, and this",00:36:52.110,00:36:58.250
"collectively represents
my computer's memory.",00:36:58.250,00:37:01.260
"Now we'll just do dot, dot, dot.",00:37:01.260,00:37:03.136
"So in other words, when I now prompt the
user with get string to give me a",00:37:03.136,00:37:06.260
"string, what happens?",00:37:06.260,00:37:07.350
"If the user types in ""hello,"" that ends
up in H-E-L-L-O. But suppose the",00:37:07.350,00:37:14.270
user then types in--,00:37:14.270,00:37:15.720
"actually, I shouldn't have done
hello because we're asking",00:37:15.720,00:37:17.250
them for their names.,00:37:17.250,00:37:18.330
So let's go back if I can do this.,00:37:18.330,00:37:20.580
"&gt;&gt; So if I type in D-A-V-I-D for my name,
but recall that the second line of",00:37:20.580,00:37:26.130
"code was get string again
to get their school.",00:37:26.130,00:37:29.220
"Where is that word that the user
types in going to go next?",00:37:29.220,00:37:32.090
"Well, maybe it's going to go into
H-A-R-V-A-R-D. So even though I've",00:37:32.090,00:37:38.290
"drawn it as two rows, this is just
a whole bunch of bytes in your",00:37:38.290,00:37:41.560
computer's RAM.,00:37:41.560,00:37:42.710
"There's a problem now because now if I'm
using RAM in this very reasonable",00:37:42.710,00:37:46.560
"but sort of naive way, what can you
not apparently distinguish?",00:37:46.560,00:37:49.910
"Where one begins and where

one character from another.",00:38:41.690,00:38:45.220

&gt;&gt; Let me do one other thing now.,00:38:56.400,00:38:57.810
"It turns out that all of these squares
we've been drawing, they are, yes,",00:38:57.810,00:39:01.800
"strings, but more generally,
these things are arrays.",00:39:01.800,00:39:06.140
"An array is just a chunk of memory
that's back to back to back to back,",00:39:06.140,00:39:10.590

of this square bracket notation.",00:39:10.590,00:39:15.130

over time, but let me go ahead and",00:39:15.130,00:39:18.210
"open up, let's call it ages.",00:39:18.210,00:39:21.160
"And notice what we can do with
these same tricks, a little",00:39:21.160,00:39:23.920
bit more syntax here.,00:39:23.920,00:39:25.750
"&gt;&gt; So in line 17 of this program--
actually, let me run the program first",00:39:25.750,00:39:29.270
so we can see what this thing does.,00:39:29.270,00:39:30.770

compile this program.",00:39:30.770,00:39:33.530

How many people are in the room?,00:39:34.950,00:39:36.480
Call it three.,00:39:36.480,00:39:38.020
Age of the first person?,00:39:38.020,00:39:39.575
"18, 19, and 20.",00:39:39.575,00:39:42.710
"And now somewhat ridiculously, I just
have made a program that ages those",00:39:42.710,00:39:46.770
three people.,00:39:46.770,00:39:47.740
"&gt;&gt; So there's clearly an opportunity
for some fun arithmetic here.",00:39:47.740,00:39:50.390
"Thankfully, the math is correct.",00:39:50.390,00:39:51.560
"18 went to 19, 19 went
to 20 and so forth.",00:39:51.560,00:39:54.720
"But what's really meant to be
illustrative here is how we're storing",00:39:54.720,00:39:58.510
those three people's ages.,00:39:58.510,00:40:00.190
"Let me zoom in at what's
going on here.",00:40:00.190,00:40:02.370
"&gt;&gt; So first, these first few lines should
be getting pretty familiar.",00:40:02.370,00:40:06.240
"I'm just prompting the user for the
number of people in the room.",00:40:06.240,00:40:08.770
"Then I'm using get int and do while to
do this again and again and again.",00:40:08.770,00:40:11.490
"We've seen that pattern before, but
line 27 is new and actually quite",00:40:11.490,00:40:15.780
"useful, and will become
increasingly useful.",00:40:15.780,00:40:18.160
"Notice that what's different in line 27
is that I appear to be declaring an",00:40:18.160,00:40:21.620
"int called ages, but wait.",00:40:21.620,00:40:23.960
It's not just int ages.,00:40:23.960,00:40:27.140
"There's these square brackets,
inside of which is n.",00:40:27.140,00:40:30.130
"&gt;&gt; So the bracket n in this context, not
inside of a printf statement here but",00:40:30.130,00:40:35.150
"in this sole line 27, this line is
saying, give me n ints, each of which",00:40:35.150,00:40:44.370
is of type int.,00:40:44.370,00:40:46.080
"So this is a bucket, so to speak, of,
in this case, three integers back to",00:40:46.080,00:40:49.870
"back to back so that I effectively
have three variables.",00:40:49.870,00:40:52.770
"The alternative, to be
clear, would be this.",00:40:52.770,00:40:54.890
"&gt;&gt; If I wanted the first student's
age, I might do this.",00:40:54.890,00:40:57.400
"If I wanted the second student's
age I might do this.",00:40:57.400,00:40:59.520
"If I wanted the third student's
age, I might do this.",00:40:59.520,00:41:01.860
"And god forbid we need everyone's
age in this room--",00:41:01.860,00:41:04.320
"I mean, this is a heck of a lot of copy,
paste again and again and again.",00:41:04.320,00:41:07.670
"And plus once I compile this program,
if another student walks in over out",00:41:07.670,00:41:10.870
"of that door, now my number
of variables is incorrect.",00:41:10.870,00:41:14.200
"&gt;&gt; So what's nice about an array is as
soon as you start feeling yourself",00:41:14.200,00:41:17.450
"copying and pasting, odds are that's
not the best approach.",00:41:17.450,00:41:20.190
An array is dynamic potentially.,00:41:20.190,00:41:22.240
"I don't know in advance how many people
are going to be in the room,",00:41:22.240,00:41:24.610
"but I do know I need n of them, and I'll
figure out n when the time comes.",00:41:24.610,00:41:28.670
"This line of code now means, give me a
chunk of memory that looks like this",00:41:28.670,00:41:35.500
"where the number of boxes on the screen
is entirely dependent on n that",00:41:35.500,00:41:40.380
the user typed in.,00:41:40.380,00:41:42.010
"&gt;&gt; So now the rest of this program is
actually pretty similar to what we",00:41:42.010,00:41:44.850
just did with characters.,00:41:44.850,00:41:46.860
"Notice I have a for loop
starting in line 30.",00:41:46.860,00:41:49.970
"So right after I get the array, I
iterate from y equals zero on up to n.",00:41:49.970,00:41:54.920
"I just have this instructive printf
message just saying, give me the age",00:41:54.920,00:41:58.890
"of person #%i, so number one,
number two, number three.",00:41:58.890,00:42:03.690
And why did I do this?,00:42:03.690,00:42:04.730
"Frankly, humans prefer to count from one
on up whereas computer scientists,",00:42:04.730,00:42:08.870
zero on up.,00:42:08.870,00:42:09.620
"computer scientists are not going to
use this kind of program, so we're",00:42:09.620,00:42:11.700
"going to just start counting
at one like normal people.",00:42:11.700,00:42:13.990
"&gt;&gt; And now in line 33, notice the slightly
different piece of syntax.",00:42:13.990,00:42:17.630
"The i-th age in that variable of type
array is going to get an int.",00:42:17.630,00:42:23.710
"And now lastly, this is just
arithmetic down here.",00:42:23.710,00:42:25.770
"I decided in a separate loop to claim
some time passes, and now in this",00:42:25.770,00:42:29.200
"separate loop, these lines execute.",00:42:29.200,00:42:31.400
"&gt;&gt; A year from now, person i will be i
years old, but notice this isn't the",00:42:31.400,00:42:35.810
variable i.,00:42:35.810,00:42:36.500
This is now %i for int.,00:42:36.500,00:42:38.390
"And notice as the first placeholder, I
plug in i plus 1, so we count like a",00:42:38.390,00:42:43.210
normal person.,00:42:43.210,00:42:44.250
"And then for the value of their age, for
i years old, I take ages bracket",00:42:44.250,00:42:49.190
i-- and why am I doing plus one here?,00:42:49.190,00:42:52.980
They just aged.,00:42:52.980,00:42:53.760
It's my stupid choice of programs.,00:42:53.760,00:42:55.030

"I could type in any number that
I actually want there.",00:42:56.810,00:42:59.770
"&gt;&gt; So what's actually all of
the relevance here?",00:42:59.770,00:43:02.430
"Well, let me actually scroll back
over here and paint a picture",00:43:02.430,00:43:07.610
of what lies ahead.,00:43:07.610,00:43:10.830

sequence of multiple chars, and what",00:43:17.070,00:43:22.500
does this say?,00:43:22.500,00:43:23.750
"It's not in the online version
of the slides.",00:43:28.530,00:43:30.600
