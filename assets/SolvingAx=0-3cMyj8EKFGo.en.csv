MARTINA BALAGOVIC: Hi.,00:00:07.644,00:00:08.560
Welcome back.,00:00:08.560,00:00:09.740
"Today's problem is about solving
homogeneous linear systems,",00:00:09.740,00:00:12.810
"A*x equals 0, but it's also
an introduction to the next",00:00:12.810,00:00:17.210
"lecture and next
recitation section,",00:00:17.210,00:00:18.774
"which are going to be about
solving non-homogeneous linear",00:00:18.774,00:00:21.190
"systems, A*x equals b.",00:00:21.190,00:00:24.000
"The problem is fill
the blanks type.",00:00:24.000,00:00:26.350
"And it says the set S of all
points with coordinates x, y,",00:00:26.350,00:00:30.880
"and z, such that x minus 5y plus
2z equals 9 is a blank in R^3.",00:00:30.880,00:00:39.420
"It is in a certain relation
to the other blank S_0",00:00:39.420,00:00:44.730
"of all the points
with coordinates x, y,",00:00:44.730,00:00:46.730
"and z that satisfy the
following linear equation,",00:00:46.730,00:00:50.210
x minus 5y plus 2z equals 0.,00:00:50.210,00:00:54.730
"After we solve this,
we have the second part",00:00:54.730,00:00:56.880
"of the problem, which
says all points of x have",00:00:56.880,00:01:00.170
"a specific form, x,
y, z equals blank, 0,",00:01:00.170,00:01:04.569
"0, plus some parameter
times blank, 1,",00:01:04.569,00:01:08.740
"0 plus some other parameter
times blank, 0, 1.",00:01:08.740,00:01:12.880
"And we need to fill
out all six blanks.",00:01:12.880,00:01:15.810
"Now you should pause the
video, fill in the blanks,",00:01:15.810,00:01:17.992
"and then come back and
see some pretty pictures",00:01:17.992,00:01:19.950
that I prepared for you.,00:01:19.950,00:01:20.950
And we're back.,00:01:28.870,00:01:30.130
"So you probably picked this
up in lectures already.",00:01:30.130,00:01:35.040
"If you have a three-dimensional
space with three degrees",00:01:35.040,00:01:38.130
"of freedom, and put in
one constraint, so put",00:01:38.130,00:01:41.910
"in one equation,
you get something",00:01:41.910,00:01:44.790
"that has two degrees
of freedom, something",00:01:44.790,00:01:46.820
that's two-dimensional.,00:01:46.820,00:01:48.450
"If this equation is linear,
rather than quadratic",00:01:48.450,00:01:50.990
"or cubic or exponential,
this something",00:01:50.990,00:01:54.050
"is something
two-dimensional and flat.",00:01:54.050,00:01:57.420
"Something two-dimensional and
flat in R^3 is also called",00:01:57.420,00:02:01.210
"a plane, or a two-plane.",00:02:01.210,00:02:05.740
"Similarly, S_0 is also a plane.",00:02:05.740,00:02:12.050
"Now, what's the relation
between S and S_0",00:02:12.050,00:02:14.990
"if they're given by
these two equations?",00:02:14.990,00:02:17.850
"Well first let's look at the
general positions in which two",00:02:17.850,00:02:21.130
planes in R^3 can be.,00:02:21.130,00:02:23.450
"First one is that they're
intersecting along a line.",00:02:23.450,00:02:27.270
"What's going to happen here is
that all points on this plane",00:02:27.270,00:02:30.820
"are points whose
coordinates satisfy",00:02:30.820,00:02:33.160
the equation of this plane.,00:02:33.160,00:02:35.070
"The points in this
plane are points",00:02:35.070,00:02:37.240
"whose coordinates satisfy
the equation of this plane.",00:02:37.240,00:02:40.020
"And the points on the line
are points whose coordinates",00:02:40.020,00:02:43.650
"satisfy the system of this
equation and this equation.",00:02:43.650,00:02:48.090
"The other position in
which two planes can be",00:02:48.090,00:02:50.420
"is that they're not intersecting
at all, that they're parallel.",00:02:50.420,00:02:54.210
"So let's start by trying
to find this line here.",00:02:54.210,00:02:58.810
"The equation of one plane is
x minus 5y plus 2z equal 9.",00:02:58.810,00:03:14.920
"The equation of the other one
is x minus 5y plus 2z equals 0.",00:03:14.920,00:03:23.690
"Now you can just
look at it and see",00:03:23.690,00:03:25.730
"how many solutions
it's supposed to have,",00:03:25.730,00:03:27.700
"or you can try
doing elimination,",00:03:27.700,00:03:29.160
"and after one step
of elimination",00:03:29.160,00:03:30.760
"get 0 equals 9,
which never happens.",00:03:30.760,00:03:33.970
"There cannot exist numbers
x, y, and z such that this",00:03:33.970,00:03:38.050
"combination of them produces
0, and the same combination",00:03:38.050,00:03:41.060
"of them produces 9
at the same time.",00:03:41.060,00:03:43.440
"So this red line
here doesn't exist,",00:03:43.440,00:03:46.910
"and the situation of these two
planes S and S_0 is this one,",00:03:46.910,00:03:50.830
they're parallel.,00:03:50.830,00:03:51.900
"So let's add the word
parallel in here.",00:03:51.900,00:03:59.810
"And let's move on to the
other half of the problem.",00:03:59.810,00:04:03.640
"The other half said all points
of S have this specific form.",00:04:03.640,00:04:08.640
"Now let me call
this point here P_0.",00:04:08.640,00:04:14.680
"If all points of
S have this form,",00:04:14.680,00:04:17.120
"we can plug in any
parameter c_1 and c_2 here",00:04:17.120,00:04:19.980
"and we're going to get
a point of the plane.",00:04:19.980,00:04:22.040
"So in particular, we can plug
in c_1 and c_2 equal to 0.",00:04:22.040,00:04:30.270
"What we get then is
that the point (x, y, z)",00:04:30.270,00:04:33.440
"equals P_0 is a point of
the plane S. So P_0 is in S.",00:04:33.440,00:04:43.890
"What do we know
about the point P_0?",00:04:43.890,00:04:46.290
"Well the fact that
it's in S means",00:04:46.290,00:04:48.500
"that its coordinates, x
minus 5y plus 2z equal 9.",00:04:48.500,00:04:58.920
"That's the equation
of S. But we also",00:04:58.920,00:05:01.400
"know that y and z
are equal to 0 and 0.",00:05:01.400,00:05:04.675
"Solving this system we get that
the x-coordinate of this point",00:05:11.310,00:05:18.360
"P_0 is 9, and we
can just add 9 here.",00:05:18.360,00:05:23.235
"So we just have two
blanks left to fill.",00:05:25.930,00:05:28.556
"Before we'll fill
them, let me show you",00:05:28.556,00:05:30.180
a picture that I drew here.,00:05:30.180,00:05:32.760
"So we have these two planes,
S_0 and S, which are parallel.",00:05:32.760,00:05:38.790
"They're given by
these equations.",00:05:38.790,00:05:42.070
"And the plane S_0
has a point 0 in it,",00:05:42.070,00:05:45.780
"because the equation is x
minus 5y plus 2z equals 0,",00:05:45.780,00:05:50.090
"so it satisfied by 0, 0, 0.",00:05:50.090,00:05:52.310
"The plane S has this point P_0
in it, which is (9, 0, 0)--",00:05:52.310,00:05:59.240
we just figured this out.,00:05:59.240,00:06:00.970
"And there's this vector
connecting one plane",00:06:00.970,00:06:03.720
to the other.,00:06:03.720,00:06:05.260
"Now, since those two
planes are parallel",00:06:05.260,00:06:07.640
"and there's this vector going
between them, what we can see",00:06:07.640,00:06:11.280
"is that a good way
to get any point in S",00:06:11.280,00:06:15.340
"is to go to any point in S_0
and go up by this vector.",00:06:15.340,00:06:21.880
Now let me write this down.,00:06:21.880,00:06:25.340
"What I just said is that any
point in S is of the form--",00:06:25.340,00:06:36.350
"use this vector to go up--
plus any point in S_0.",00:06:36.350,00:06:48.700
"And if we compare this
to this expression here,",00:06:48.700,00:06:51.360
"we also get P_0 plus
this linear combination.",00:06:51.360,00:06:55.930
"So this here has to
be a point in S_0.",00:06:55.930,00:07:03.130
"Now we're left with a question
of how to parameterize",00:07:03.130,00:07:05.390
all points in S_0.,00:07:05.390,00:07:06.650
"What are all the points in
S_0, and what does this problem",00:07:06.650,00:07:09.620
"have to do with solving
homogeneous linear equations?",00:07:09.620,00:07:12.430
"Well, let me write
this equation of S_0",00:07:12.430,00:07:15.680
in a slightly different way.,00:07:15.680,00:07:18.090
"Let me write it as 1, minus
5, 2, x, y, z, equals 0.",00:07:18.090,00:07:35.270
"And let me think of this
as a matrix of the system.",00:07:35.270,00:07:38.690
"It's a very tiny matrix,
but it's a matrix.",00:07:38.690,00:07:41.270
"And think of it as a
matrix dot a vector equals",00:07:41.270,00:07:44.900
"0, and trying to find all
solutions of the system.",00:07:44.900,00:07:47.840
"Well let's do row
reductions here.",00:07:47.840,00:07:50.790
"It's already as upper triangular
as these tiny matrices get.",00:07:50.790,00:07:54.280
This is a pivot.,00:07:54.280,00:07:55.180
So we have a pivot variable x.,00:07:58.330,00:08:02.255
"These are free
variables, y and z.",00:08:05.150,00:08:13.960
"And if you remember how
to solve these systems,",00:08:13.960,00:08:17.080
"for each free variable we
get one particular solution.",00:08:17.080,00:08:20.000
"So we get one particular
solution when we plug in y is 1",00:08:24.690,00:08:29.820
"and all the other
free variables are 0.",00:08:29.820,00:08:33.860
"Plugging it in here, we
just get that in that case,",00:08:33.860,00:08:37.500
"x-- so we get x minus 5 times
1 plus 2 times 0 equals 0.",00:08:37.500,00:08:46.990
So x is equal to 5.,00:08:46.990,00:08:50.270
"And the other solution
is for setting",00:08:50.270,00:08:52.450
"all free variables
equal to 0, except z",00:08:52.450,00:08:55.630
which we set equal to 1.,00:08:55.630,00:08:57.290
"And then we get x minus 5 times
0 plus 2 times 1 equals 0.",00:08:57.290,00:09:03.260
"So we get that in this
case, x equals minus 2.",00:09:03.260,00:09:10.520
"And any solution of this system
is going to be of the form",00:09:10.520,00:09:15.130
"some constant times this plus
some other constant times this.",00:09:15.130,00:09:20.800
"And if we walk back to
our original problem here,",00:09:20.800,00:09:24.340
"we see that these parameters,
these numbers here,",00:09:24.340,00:09:26.660
"have been set up exactly so that
we can just take these numbers",00:09:26.660,00:09:30.890
"and just copy them
over, 5 and minus 2.",00:09:30.890,00:09:36.220
"And this is the general form
of any point of the plane S.",00:09:36.220,00:09:39.650
"It's go up this vector, and
then add a point in S_0,",00:09:39.650,00:09:44.210
"in the parallel plane that
passes through the origin.",00:09:44.210,00:09:46.820
This finishes our problem.,00:09:46.820,00:09:47.910
"But what I would
encourage you to do now",00:09:47.910,00:09:49.760
"is to go on to the next lecture,
watch the next recitation",00:09:49.760,00:09:53.920
"video, and then come
back here and think",00:09:53.920,00:09:56.230
"about what is it that
we really did here",00:09:56.230,00:09:59.480
on this half of the board.,00:09:59.480,00:10:00.870
Thank you.,00:10:00.870,00:10:02.630
