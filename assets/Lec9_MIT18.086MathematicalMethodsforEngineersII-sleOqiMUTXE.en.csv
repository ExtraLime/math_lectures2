"PROFESSOR: All
right, so I'll start",00:00:15.122,00:00:16.580
"with this review board, which
shows the conservation law.",00:00:16.580,00:00:23.270
"Scalar, one unknown,
one dimension,",00:00:23.270,00:00:27.140
"x, one space variable, and
the flux function is f of u.",00:00:27.140,00:00:34.310
That's the differential form.,00:00:34.310,00:00:37.100
"We have seen that at some
points that differential form",00:00:37.100,00:00:42.900
"produces a discontinuous
solution, a discontinuity.",00:00:42.900,00:00:48.400
"In that case we
are better off with",00:00:48.400,00:00:51.650
the integrated integral form.,00:00:51.650,00:00:54.720
"So I just integrate that one
from a point x_left to a point",00:00:54.720,00:01:00.610
"x_right, from an a to
b, and that gives me-- I",00:01:00.610,00:01:04.900
have then the integral.,00:01:04.900,00:01:07.620
"So if u was density,
for example,",00:01:07.620,00:01:11.070
"the integral of density
will be the mass.",00:01:11.070,00:01:13.630
"That's the quantity
that I'm seeing here,",00:01:13.630,00:01:17.530
"so this is the rate
of change of mass",00:01:17.530,00:01:20.210
"in the interval comes from flux
going out minus flux coming in.",00:01:20.210,00:01:29.310
"So that's the conservation
law in its pure statement.",00:01:29.310,00:01:34.530
"And we learned that
solution for this--",00:01:34.530,00:01:40.880
"while we're looking at
the differential problem,",00:01:40.880,00:01:43.570
"we can follow these
characteristics",00:01:43.570,00:01:46.170
from the initial time zero.,00:01:46.170,00:01:49.490
"So at time zero we look
at a point x and the value",00:01:49.490,00:01:55.960
"at that point just
travels-- is sort of safely",00:01:55.960,00:02:01.090
"carried up the characteristic
line, which is that equals x_0.",00:02:01.090,00:02:07.510
"And the problem arose when
characteristics either collided",00:02:07.510,00:02:14.970
into each other or separated.,00:02:14.970,00:02:17.690
"Those are the two
difficulties and they",00:02:21.340,00:02:23.480
have different resolutions.,00:02:23.480,00:02:28.480
"So this is what we met
in the traffic example",00:02:28.480,00:02:32.370
when a light goes red.,00:02:32.370,00:02:35.580
"When a light goes red cars
are coming up to the light,",00:02:35.580,00:02:41.160
"in front of the light
the density is low.",00:02:41.160,00:02:46.950
The cars have to brake quickly.,00:02:46.950,00:02:49.410
"So something happens--
that's a question mark there.",00:02:49.410,00:02:52.600
"What do you do when
characteristics collide?",00:02:52.600,00:02:55.060
"When the value here cannot
be both the initial value",00:02:55.060,00:02:59.430
"that's coming up that
characteristic and the initial",00:02:59.430,00:03:02.380
"value that's coming up there
because they're different?",00:03:02.380,00:03:05.720
"So we need a rule
for what to do there.",00:03:05.720,00:03:08.180
"And we also need a
rule for what to do",00:03:08.180,00:03:10.780
in case of an empty space.,00:03:10.780,00:03:13.600
"When no characteristics--
here, two characteristics",00:03:13.600,00:03:16.920
"are hitting, here none
are touching there.",00:03:16.920,00:03:20.160
"Characteristics are separating
in this case and the question",00:03:20.160,00:03:23.280
"is, what solution do
you fill in the middle",00:03:23.280,00:03:25.540
"when you haven't got
a characteristic?",00:03:25.540,00:03:27.580
It's not coming from the start.,00:03:27.580,00:03:32.030
"OK, what solution to choose?",00:03:32.030,00:03:35.590
The answers will be different.,00:03:35.590,00:03:38.210
"And let me take the first one,
the collision question, first.",00:03:38.210,00:03:44.490
"So what will happen
is a shock will form.",00:03:44.490,00:03:52.850
"There'll be a shock line so
that these characteristics carry",00:03:52.850,00:03:59.330
"information into the shock, by
the way, that's a big deal--",00:03:59.330,00:04:04.500
"up until they hit the shock,
and these characteristics",00:04:04.500,00:04:07.710
carry their information.,00:04:07.710,00:04:08.970
"And across the shock we
have different values,",00:04:08.970,00:04:14.110
"u on the left and
u on the right.",00:04:14.110,00:04:16.960
"So that's one possible
form of the solution",00:04:16.960,00:04:23.490
"because that will solve
the equation in this region",00:04:23.490,00:04:26.660
"where the characteristics
from the right",00:04:26.660,00:04:28.760
are following the formula.,00:04:28.760,00:04:30.920
"It'll solve it from the left,
so everything comes down",00:04:30.920,00:04:35.060
"to the jump condition
at the shock.",00:04:35.060,00:04:39.650
What's the shock speed?,00:04:39.650,00:04:41.260
Where does this shock go?,00:04:41.260,00:04:44.230
"It's to find that
shock in the xt-plane",00:04:44.230,00:04:47.500
"that I have to use
this integral form.",00:04:47.500,00:04:52.970
"I must use the integral
form because I've",00:04:52.970,00:04:54.730
"got a discontinuity and
the differential form just",00:04:54.730,00:04:57.880
doesn't make sense.,00:04:57.880,00:04:59.280
"OK, I wrote down the key idea
here or the conclusion, but not",00:04:59.280,00:05:04.790
the reasoning.,00:05:04.790,00:05:06.360
"I'm looking for
this jump condition",00:05:06.360,00:05:08.460
"at the shock, which is
going to locate the shock.",00:05:08.460,00:05:13.370
"And the key quantity
that I have to find",00:05:13.370,00:05:16.230
"is the shock speed,
which will tell me",00:05:16.230,00:05:19.040
"where that shock is going,
how it's moving up in time.",00:05:19.040,00:05:24.520
"So time is going that way, x is
going this way in this picture.",00:05:24.520,00:05:30.010
"So this has a speed, s of t.",00:05:30.010,00:05:33.400
And here's the conclusion.,00:05:36.790,00:05:38.330
There's the jump condition.,00:05:38.330,00:05:41.270
So what does it mean?,00:05:41.270,00:05:43.730
"This notation, this bracket
notation is the jump.",00:05:43.730,00:05:48.190
The shock equation is beautiful.,00:05:51.640,00:05:53.350
"It says that s, the shock
speed, times the jump",00:05:53.350,00:05:57.230
in u is the jump in f of u.,00:05:57.230,00:06:00.510
"And let me take
this example that",00:06:00.510,00:06:03.640
"is sort of the Burgers'
equation example.",00:06:03.640,00:06:07.950
"So this is the example that
comes from Burgers' equation.",00:06:07.950,00:06:11.360
"That's the example
where the flux",00:06:18.260,00:06:20.730
"is this nice parabolic
function u squared over 2.",00:06:20.730,00:06:27.420
"Then the change in flux, the
jump in the flux function",00:06:27.420,00:06:32.520
"is u right squared minus
u left squared over 2",00:06:32.520,00:06:36.630
"and I divide by the jump in u,
which is u_right minus u_left",00:06:36.630,00:06:41.330
"and that cancels
beautifully and leaves me",00:06:41.330,00:06:44.600
"with the 1/2 of
u_right plus u_left.",00:06:44.600,00:06:48.680
"It tells me that the shock speed
is exactly halfway between.",00:06:48.680,00:06:54.270
"It's exactly the average,
in this Burger's example,",00:06:54.270,00:06:58.820
"of the characteristic
speed from the right",00:06:58.820,00:07:02.420
"and the characteristics
speed from the left.",00:07:02.420,00:07:04.720
"And notice, it's in between.",00:07:04.720,00:07:07.770
That's crucial.,00:07:07.770,00:07:09.320
"That tells us that
this figure is good.",00:07:09.320,00:07:12.130
"It tells us that characteristics
are entering the shock",00:07:12.130,00:07:17.010
from both sides.,00:07:17.010,00:07:18.440
"Characteristic lines
are entering the shock.",00:07:18.440,00:07:20.550
"The shock is somehow, in
this sort of nonlinear case,",00:07:20.550,00:07:25.460
"it's somehow kind of cutting
out bits of the solution,",00:07:25.460,00:07:31.070
"reducing the energy,
reducing the entropy,",00:07:31.070,00:07:33.590
"reducing the total variation
as we'll see it in a minute.",00:07:33.590,00:07:37.830
"So that's the answer here and
I guess I have to justify,",00:07:37.830,00:07:41.740
where did this come from?,00:07:41.740,00:07:44.880
"Well, it came from
this integral form.",00:07:44.880,00:07:49.600
"Suppose I integrate
from a little bit",00:07:52.210,00:07:55.750
"to the left of the
shock to a little bit",00:07:55.750,00:07:58.117
to the right of the shock.,00:07:58.117,00:07:59.200
"Of course, that's where I
want to integrate in order",00:07:59.200,00:08:02.630
to capture the shock.,00:08:02.630,00:08:04.540
"OK, so if I just
take that equation",00:08:04.540,00:08:07.700
"and write it over here, and
I'll imagine-- because I'm not",00:08:07.700,00:08:12.510
"going to be-- x_left and x_right
are going to be pretty near",00:08:12.510,00:08:15.410
"the shock-- u up to the
shock will pretty much",00:08:15.410,00:08:19.590
have a constant value u_left.,00:08:19.590,00:08:21.630
"So approximately, that
is the shock position.",00:08:21.630,00:08:26.960
"Let me say the shock
is at-- capital",00:08:26.960,00:08:30.600
X is the position of the shock.,00:08:30.600,00:08:32.100
"So I have x minus x_left times
u on the left of the shock.",00:08:32.100,00:08:42.460
I'm doing that integral.,00:08:45.790,00:08:47.570
"Oh, I need d by dt of all this.",00:08:47.570,00:08:51.450
So d by dt.,00:08:51.450,00:08:52.200
"It's d by dt of the
integral of u dx.",00:08:55.000,00:08:57.540
"Let me just put here
what I'm computing.",00:08:57.540,00:09:01.520
"I'm computing that
from x_left to x_right.",00:09:01.520,00:09:05.840
"Well, I'm going up
to x, up to capital",00:09:05.840,00:09:08.560
"X where the shock
is, and then onward.",00:09:08.560,00:09:10.880
"So here I went up to x
using the value u left.",00:09:10.880,00:09:15.260
"And now will be the
onward part, which",00:09:15.260,00:09:18.750
"will be x_right minus x, the
half of the interval that's",00:09:18.750,00:09:25.050
"on the right of the
shock, times u right.",00:09:25.050,00:09:27.250
"And then copying this term is
exactly our jump in f of u.",00:09:30.160,00:09:38.430
Plus the jump in f of u is zero.,00:09:38.430,00:09:46.530
"Those words, total variation
are a reminder to myself",00:09:49.610,00:09:53.020
for what comes next.,00:09:53.020,00:09:54.270
"OK, so is that OK?",00:09:54.270,00:09:58.330
"That will be approximately
zero because u wasn't exactly",00:09:58.330,00:10:03.440
constant on the left and right.,00:10:03.440,00:10:06.700
"It didn't stay at the
value u_L but we're",00:10:06.700,00:10:09.340
"squeezing the
interval down where",00:10:09.340,00:10:11.680
it's essentially constant.,00:10:11.680,00:10:13.560
"OK, so now, just look
and see what we've got.",00:10:13.560,00:10:20.850
"dx/dt is the shock speed, so
that's s, multiplying u_L,",00:10:20.850,00:10:30.990
"and here I have-- the
derivative of that is zero,",00:10:30.990,00:10:34.680
the derivative of x_R is zero.,00:10:34.680,00:10:37.230
"Here I have a minus,
so it's minus u_R.",00:10:37.230,00:10:39.750
"dx/dt times that number plus the
jump in f of u, left to right,",00:10:42.540,00:10:50.320
is 0.,00:10:50.320,00:10:52.250
And that's our equation.,00:10:52.250,00:10:54.560
"If I put this on
the opposite side",00:10:57.570,00:11:00.790
it becomes u_right minus u_left.,00:11:00.790,00:11:02.710
Shall I do that?,00:11:02.710,00:11:04.330
"So I'll keep this on this
side, got a good sign,",00:11:04.330,00:11:09.360
"but I'll move this
onto the other side",00:11:09.360,00:11:11.820
"so it will be the shock
speed, d capital X dt times",00:11:11.820,00:11:16.030
"u_R minus u_L, which
is the jump in u.",00:11:16.030,00:11:22.110
So that's great.,00:11:22.110,00:11:23.790
"We now have a way to deal
with shocks that collide.",00:11:23.790,00:11:28.420
"So that was a derivation of
this jump condition, which first",00:11:31.740,00:11:40.690
"had a name, two authors Rankine,
Hugoniot in gas dynamics,",00:11:40.690,00:11:45.490
"but then it was seen
as the right condition",00:11:45.490,00:11:48.860
in all conservation laws.,00:11:48.860,00:11:52.420
OK.,00:11:52.420,00:11:53.170
"And now I'm ready to
comment on the second issue.",00:11:53.170,00:11:56.630
"What do you do when
characteristics separate?",00:11:56.630,00:12:00.350
"Well, let me say
what you don't do.",00:12:00.350,00:12:03.220
"You could, without
wrecking the equation,",00:12:03.220,00:12:08.560
"you could try to
put a shock in there",00:12:08.560,00:12:12.440
"and give this the
value u on the left,",00:12:12.440,00:12:15.680
"even though a
characteristic isn't",00:12:15.680,00:12:18.250
"telling us what's going on
in this space or this one.",00:12:18.250,00:12:22.450
"You could try to put
a shock in there.",00:12:22.450,00:12:24.810
"You could maybe satisfy
the jump condition",00:12:24.810,00:12:26.900
"if you put the right shock in,
but the characteristics would",00:12:26.900,00:12:31.740
be coming out and that's wrong.,00:12:31.740,00:12:36.150
"And it's called the
entropy condition, which",00:12:36.150,00:12:40.400
says that this can't happen.,00:12:40.400,00:12:42.740
"That the derivative of
entropy has a certain sign",00:12:42.740,00:12:46.390
and it rules this out.,00:12:46.390,00:12:48.860
"It rules out this possibility
of characteristics",00:12:48.860,00:12:52.230
"emerging from the shock and
we need a totally different",00:12:52.230,00:12:55.330
solution.,00:12:55.330,00:12:56.170
"And it turns out to
be a fan in there.",00:12:56.170,00:12:59.050
"So we put in a fan
of characteristics",00:12:59.050,00:13:04.710
"coming from here and that
gives a solution that actually",00:13:04.710,00:13:09.500
will depend on x over t.,00:13:09.500,00:13:14.490
"This solution will be a
simple-- a simple ratio x over t",00:13:14.490,00:13:23.870
enters that.,00:13:23.870,00:13:24.820
"In other words, that gives
us a smooth solution,",00:13:28.500,00:13:30.910
"and I guess, thinking about
the traffic example, that's",00:13:30.910,00:13:34.410
exactly what happens.,00:13:34.410,00:13:35.640
So this is the shock part.,00:13:35.640,00:13:37.650
"Now for the fan
part, what happens",00:13:37.650,00:13:42.850
"when we have a bunch of cars
sitting there, ready to go?",00:13:42.850,00:13:48.740
"The light goes green, the
first cars start moving,",00:13:48.740,00:13:56.430
"cars behind them see the car in
front moving, they start moving",00:13:56.430,00:14:02.150
"and so the initial profile
would be, in this case,",00:14:02.150,00:14:11.140
"for cars, would be high
density and then zero density.",00:14:11.140,00:14:20.180
"So this would be maximum density
sitting at the light and zero",00:14:20.180,00:14:28.800
"density in front of the light
and then the light goes green",00:14:28.800,00:14:33.180
now and what happens?,00:14:33.180,00:14:35.180
"Well, as we all know those
first cars pull ahead",00:14:35.180,00:14:38.920
"and the profile is these cars
haven't yet started to move.",00:14:38.920,00:14:47.670
"These have started to
move and there's a profile",00:14:47.670,00:14:50.340
there and then zero density.,00:14:50.340,00:14:56.160
"So this represents the
first car, the lead car.",00:14:56.160,00:15:00.290
"In front of that car is zero
density and that's the fan.",00:15:00.290,00:15:08.900
That's the x over t expression.,00:15:08.900,00:15:14.600
"So a simple linear expression,
which will flatten out;",00:15:14.600,00:15:19.880
"as time goes on, these cars
will be going faster and faster",00:15:19.880,00:15:24.190
"and then eventually
up to full speed.",00:15:24.190,00:15:28.440
"OK, so that's the fan.",00:15:28.440,00:15:30.860
"Maybe now is my chance to
speak about this concept",00:15:34.950,00:15:41.060
of the variation in a function.,00:15:41.060,00:15:44.350
"The idea will be now, how do
we get the finite difference",00:15:44.350,00:15:49.790
method to do this automatically?,00:15:49.790,00:15:54.370
"Well, OK, one way to do it
is put in a little viscosity.",00:15:54.370,00:16:00.180
"This rule, the rule that picks
out this shock in one case,",00:16:03.540,00:16:10.180
"of colliding
characteristics, and this fan",00:16:10.180,00:16:17.810
"in the case of separating
characteristics, one way",00:16:17.810,00:16:22.250
"to get to those
two solution would",00:16:22.250,00:16:25.520
"be to put in a little
bit of viscosity",00:16:25.520,00:16:32.560
and then let epsilon go to zero.,00:16:32.560,00:16:35.930
"And the result would
be these two solutions.",00:16:35.930,00:16:42.070
"And in a way, that's what finite
differences is going to do.",00:16:42.070,00:16:45.950
"Finite difference
or finite volume",00:16:45.950,00:16:47.760
"is going to be a
numerical viscosity",00:16:47.760,00:16:52.530
"and the epsilon in
the Burgers' equation",00:16:52.530,00:16:58.400
"would become delta t or a delta
x in the numerical method,",00:16:58.400,00:17:05.844
"in the finite
difference equation.",00:17:05.844,00:17:07.260
And then what's the concept?,00:17:10.810,00:17:12.600
"So we have to find
finite differences.",00:17:12.600,00:17:15.740
"And we want those-- the
point is finite differences",00:17:15.740,00:17:25.100
sort of takes more care.,00:17:25.100,00:17:27.300
"We can't just create
something that's",00:17:27.300,00:17:31.310
consistent in the smooth case.,00:17:31.310,00:17:35.620
"Up till now we've just
had no hesitation.",00:17:35.620,00:17:40.210
"We replaced derivatives
by differences",00:17:40.210,00:17:43.680
"without too many
worries, really.",00:17:43.680,00:17:46.270
"And that was fine as long
as the solution is smooth.",00:17:49.040,00:17:51.500
"But now if we're going
to replace derivatives",00:17:51.500,00:17:55.630
"by differences, we have
to do it in such a way",00:17:55.630,00:17:59.370
"that this entropy
condition, these solutions",00:17:59.370,00:18:05.400
emerge automatically.,00:18:05.400,00:18:07.800
"And really, in a way that--
our finite difference",00:18:07.800,00:18:15.420
"or our finite volume
methods should somehow",00:18:15.420,00:18:18.780
"conserve mass the same way
the true equation does.",00:18:18.780,00:18:24.100
"So those are two
different points.",00:18:24.100,00:18:27.020
"First point is this
question of total variation.",00:18:27.020,00:18:31.720
"What's the total
variation in a function?",00:18:31.720,00:18:33.610
"Well, let me draw a function.",00:18:36.240,00:18:41.220
"The total variation
is-- well, let me see.",00:18:41.220,00:18:44.190
"Total variation in a
function u is going to be,",00:18:44.190,00:18:50.480
"by definition, the integral of
the absolute value of du/dx.",00:18:50.480,00:18:57.130
"OK now we have to
understand this concept.",00:19:03.180,00:19:09.060
"It's beautiful that the analysis
has led to a quantity as simple",00:19:09.060,00:19:21.350
"as that, as a guide.",00:19:21.350,00:19:25.750
"So when we create finite
difference methods we will ask,",00:19:25.750,00:19:31.250
"are they total
variation diminishing?",00:19:31.250,00:19:36.260
"So TVD will be total
variation diminishing methods.",00:19:36.260,00:19:42.060
"Methods where this quantity
does not increase in time.",00:19:42.060,00:19:46.600
"Let me just understand
this quantity first.",00:19:49.180,00:19:52.050
The absolute value is crucial.,00:19:52.050,00:19:53.600
"If the absolute
value was not there,",00:19:53.600,00:19:57.550
"then I would just have the
integral of the derivative,",00:19:57.550,00:20:01.770
"so it would be u at that
point minus u at that.",00:20:01.770,00:20:06.250
"But here I'm taking absolute
values, so for a while",00:20:06.250,00:20:11.110
"the derivative is
positive, up to there.",00:20:11.110,00:20:14.220
"So the integral gives me
this value minus this.",00:20:14.220,00:20:16.770
"Then, in this region, the
derivative is negative,",00:20:19.840,00:20:24.160
but I'm taking absolute value.,00:20:24.160,00:20:26.560
"Do you see that that
integral will split",00:20:26.560,00:20:30.450
into four separate integrals?,00:20:30.450,00:20:32.180
"The total variation will be this
difference plus this difference",00:20:32.180,00:20:37.170
plus this plus this.,00:20:37.170,00:20:39.350
"I'll have four--
in this example--",00:20:39.350,00:20:42.470
"have four positive
contributions to the variation.",00:20:42.470,00:20:46.960
"And that's the key
quantity there.",00:20:51.350,00:20:54.100
"And what a shock
will do-- can I maybe",00:20:54.100,00:20:56.470
"mention in this figure what
a shock does, can do, would",00:20:56.470,00:21:03.630
"be to somehow cut out
part of the variation.",00:21:03.630,00:21:10.970
"When a shock occurs it might
happen that these things are",00:21:10.970,00:21:14.940
"going into the shock,
these are going",00:21:14.940,00:21:17.410
"in from that side, and
the shock kind of jumps",00:21:17.410,00:21:23.310
"from this value, u_left,
to this value, u_right,",00:21:23.310,00:21:28.710
"following the shock
condition when it emerges.",00:21:28.710,00:21:32.670
"And this additional
variation is wiped out.",00:21:32.670,00:21:37.030
"You see that the variation
for the solution that",00:21:37.030,00:21:43.020
"contains a shock is still--
this part is still there,",00:21:43.020,00:21:46.810
"but this part is all
downhill, so it's just this.",00:21:46.810,00:21:50.150
It's that minus that.,00:21:52.710,00:21:54.460
"And the middle two
parts have been cut out.",00:21:54.460,00:21:58.350
"OK, so that's the total
variation in a function.",00:21:58.350,00:22:01.840
"Let me just take the
most important example",00:22:01.840,00:22:06.560
"that's not total variation
diminishing, which",00:22:06.560,00:22:09.274
is Lax-Wendroff.,00:22:09.274,00:22:09.940
"The one-- even in
the linear case.",00:22:12.720,00:22:16.250
"The one experiment we've done
with that profile, where,",00:22:21.330,00:22:27.400
"you remember, we had a wall of
water and the exact solution",00:22:27.400,00:22:34.220
"brought the wall to the left
with velocity c, with speed c,",00:22:34.220,00:22:39.820
"but Lax-Wendroff,
which did quite well",00:22:39.820,00:22:44.000
"staying near the
discontinuity, near the jump,",00:22:44.000,00:22:53.410
had a little oscillation behind.,00:22:53.410,00:23:00.970
"That was essentially our one
objection to Lax-Wendroff,",00:23:00.970,00:23:05.590
was that oscillation showing up.,00:23:05.590,00:23:09.900
"And so that's telling us
that the variation-- see,",00:23:09.900,00:23:14.970
"the variation in the true
solution is just that step.",00:23:14.970,00:23:20.550
"The variation in the
Lax-Wendroff answer",00:23:20.550,00:23:24.520
"is this bigger
step plus this one",00:23:24.520,00:23:28.540
"plus this one plus
this, larger than 1.",00:23:28.540,00:23:31.750
"Roughly the match is that
monotone methods-- so here's",00:23:36.010,00:23:45.000
the general picture.,00:23:45.000,00:23:46.750
"We can get monotone, or I'll
say, all positive coefficients,",00:23:46.750,00:23:57.730
"and those will be total
variation diminishing.",00:23:57.730,00:24:02.330
Great.,00:24:02.330,00:24:04.460
"Why don't I draw--
recall a monotone example",00:24:04.460,00:24:07.990
was Lax-Friedrichs or upwind.,00:24:07.990,00:24:12.650
"Upwind will be our model, so
let me draw the upwind one.",00:24:12.650,00:24:17.320
"The upwind one didn't increase
the variation, it stayed at 1.",00:24:17.320,00:24:24.830
"We had no oscillations,
but it was low accuracy.",00:24:24.830,00:24:31.630
So first order.,00:24:31.630,00:24:32.860
"We can't do better than
first-order accuracy, the order",00:24:38.440,00:24:45.355
"of accuracy I'm measuring in
the smooth part of the solution",00:24:45.355,00:24:50.860
"because that's where I can take
Taylor series and match terms",00:24:50.860,00:24:54.950
"and see which is the first
one that doesn't match.",00:24:54.950,00:24:58.730
"And Lax-Friedrichs and
upwind was first order.",00:24:58.730,00:25:05.950
"Then our problem is that if I
allow a negative coefficient",00:25:05.950,00:25:22.540
"then variation increases,
oscillations will come in,",00:25:22.540,00:25:32.080
"but I can get the accuracy
up to second order or higher.",00:25:32.080,00:25:37.730
"And Lax-Wendroff is the
example, the key example",00:25:41.480,00:25:46.130
there that I'll continue with.,00:25:46.130,00:25:47.960
"OK, that's the idea
of total variation.",00:25:47.960,00:25:53.780
"It just gives us
a quantity to work",00:25:53.780,00:25:59.650
with when we see oscillation.,00:25:59.650,00:26:07.040
"And of course, I'm
interested in oscillations,",00:26:07.040,00:26:10.770
"so this is a linear case
with a discontinuity.",00:26:10.770,00:26:14.920
"I don't think it's quite
fair to call it a shock.",00:26:14.920,00:26:18.540
"At least, the
shocks that we meet",00:26:18.540,00:26:21.500
"in conservation laws in
the nonlinear problems,",00:26:21.500,00:26:25.230
"they're created--
the ones we saw here",00:26:25.230,00:26:28.130
"are created for nonlinear
reasons, colliding",00:26:28.130,00:26:34.970
"characteristics, whereas the
linear case has characteristics",00:26:34.970,00:26:38.960
all parallel.,00:26:38.960,00:26:39.830
"So here, we're in
the lecture, we're",00:26:42.930,00:26:46.240
"really into the second lecture
into the scientific computing",00:26:46.240,00:26:52.460
part of our problem.,00:26:52.460,00:26:54.010
"So that's the analysis
part, the PDE part.",00:26:54.010,00:26:58.930
"Now comes the experience of
quite a lot of people working",00:26:58.930,00:27:08.380
"hard to identify a way to get
second-order accuracy where",00:27:08.380,00:27:17.640
"it's smooth and monotonicity
or something like it",00:27:17.640,00:27:25.220
where the shocks are.,00:27:25.220,00:27:28.090
So that's essentially the goal.,00:27:28.090,00:27:32.640
"Our method is going to
turn out to be nonlinear.",00:27:32.640,00:27:35.850
"It's going to have some--
it'll be called a flux limiter.",00:27:35.850,00:27:42.510
"The key quantity
will be the flux.",00:27:42.510,00:27:47.680
"And for a smooth function
when u_right and u_left are",00:27:47.680,00:27:56.940
"very close, the flux is small,
we don't have a problem.",00:27:56.940,00:28:02.000
"But at a shock where there's
a significant jump in u",00:28:02.000,00:28:06.250
"and especially in f
of u, the flux limiter",00:28:06.250,00:28:14.250
"is going to come in,
into the discrete method.",00:28:14.250,00:28:20.160
"Let me begin discrete
methods with a new word,",00:28:20.160,00:28:23.400
finite volumes.,00:28:23.400,00:28:24.520
"And with a new
interpretation of capital U.",00:28:27.650,00:28:34.320
"So the discrete value,
capital U_(j, n), which,",00:28:34.320,00:28:40.950
"up to now we've been thinking
of as that's an approximation",00:28:40.950,00:28:44.300
"to the true solution,
at j delta x, n delta t.",00:28:44.300,00:28:48.860
"Now, because we're dealing
with discontinuities,",00:28:48.860,00:28:52.290
we better integrate.,00:28:52.290,00:28:54.060
"We integrate over
a delta x interval.",00:28:54.060,00:28:58.230
"We take the average over
a little delta x interval",00:28:58.230,00:29:01.130
"instead of hitting
just the point.",00:29:01.130,00:29:04.120
"So the delta x interval from
j minus 1/2 to j plus 1/2,",00:29:04.120,00:29:08.270
"we take the average of
u at the time n delta t",00:29:08.270,00:29:13.340
"and that's what finite volume--
and let's think of as capital",00:29:13.340,00:29:23.670
"U, the discrete approximation.",00:29:23.670,00:29:27.360
"The appropriateness of that
is in the integral form",00:29:27.360,00:29:31.940
of the conservation law.,00:29:31.940,00:29:34.260
"So the integral form
of a conservation law",00:29:34.260,00:29:36.330
"leads us to that natural
discretization, d by dt of U,",00:29:36.330,00:29:49.670
of the average.,00:29:49.670,00:29:52.060
"You're keeping your eye
on the integral form",00:29:52.060,00:29:55.750
of the conservation law.,00:29:55.750,00:29:56.960
I'll just come back to it again.,00:29:56.960,00:29:59.720
"The derivative of the
mass, the integral",00:29:59.720,00:30:04.280
"of u-- so in the discrete case,
the difference of capital U--",00:30:04.280,00:30:10.430
"plus the integrated
term of flux at one end",00:30:10.430,00:30:15.560
"of the interval minus a
flux at the other end.",00:30:15.560,00:30:17.530
"And notice that we are
getting for the flux, half--",00:30:17.530,00:30:22.410
"so a staggered grid is
presenting itself naturally.",00:30:22.410,00:30:32.320
"And so that
f_(j+1/2), the fluxes,",00:30:32.320,00:30:35.780
"which is the critical thing,
is on the j plus 1/2 grid.",00:30:35.780,00:30:41.130
"All right, now this
could be exactly defined",00:30:41.130,00:30:45.650
as the flux at that grid point.,00:30:45.650,00:30:52.200
"Capital U squared over 2
in the Burger equation,",00:30:52.200,00:30:55.990
at that grid point.,00:30:55.990,00:30:58.550
"That would give us a totally
straightforward, first-order",00:30:58.550,00:31:04.560
numerical method.,00:31:04.560,00:31:05.800
"First order, I see
first order here in time",00:31:05.800,00:31:08.710
"and it might be better
than that in space",00:31:08.710,00:31:11.550
"because in some way
that's centered.",00:31:11.550,00:31:13.250
"But if we want higher
accuracy, if we",00:31:15.970,00:31:19.450
"want to include
Lax-Wendroff, for example,",00:31:19.450,00:31:21.700
"that includes
several values of u,",00:31:21.700,00:31:26.530
"we go to a more
general flux function.",00:31:26.530,00:31:31.510
"The whole job here is create
a smart flux function.",00:31:34.670,00:31:39.610
"So a flux function depends not
only on u in the center, u_j,",00:31:39.610,00:31:48.790
"at time n-- this
is all at time n--",00:31:48.790,00:31:52.100
"it can also depend on
values to the left of it",00:31:52.100,00:31:56.350
and values to the right.,00:31:56.350,00:31:57.400
"It may use those
values, it may not,",00:32:00.350,00:32:02.970
"but we allow that
possibility then,",00:32:02.970,00:32:05.870
"that the flux-- so this
is the numerical method",00:32:05.870,00:32:08.900
that you aim for.,00:32:08.900,00:32:10.440
"Is to choose a flux
function and of course,",00:32:10.440,00:32:16.210
"this should be consistent
with the original problem",00:32:16.210,00:32:19.620
"and that simply says that if
all the u's were the same,",00:32:19.620,00:32:26.180
"that the numerical flux
function would give you the flux",00:32:26.180,00:32:32.159
function in the given equation.,00:32:32.159,00:32:33.450
"OK, so this is our
general pattern.",00:32:36.860,00:32:39.750
"And now, the question is
really, maybe the first step",00:32:39.750,00:32:43.780
"is write a-- I would like to
write upwind and Lax-Wendroff--",00:32:43.780,00:33:00.900
"I'd like to find
their flux functions.",00:33:00.900,00:33:02.960
"I guess I'm saying
that when we look",00:33:02.960,00:33:06.710
"at an equation in
this format, we",00:33:06.710,00:33:14.630
"can take methods that
we have already used",00:33:14.630,00:33:17.150
"and see, OK, even in the
linear case, the one-way wave",00:33:17.150,00:33:22.000
"equation, what are we picking
for the flux function?",00:33:22.000,00:33:26.850
"OK, now the one distinction
is: the one-way wave equation,",00:33:26.850,00:33:32.170
"we had a constant, and
upwind, for example,",00:33:32.170,00:33:38.150
"went in the direction
decided by that speed, c.",00:33:38.150,00:33:44.070
"If the speed reversed sign
so that the waves were going",00:33:44.070,00:33:49.350
"the other way, the wind
is coming the other way,",00:33:49.350,00:33:52.390
"the upwind direction
is the other way,",00:33:52.390,00:33:55.360
so our method would change.,00:33:55.360,00:33:57.870
"Let me just write
down the flux function",00:34:02.770,00:34:05.450
"that turns out to
come for upwind",00:34:05.450,00:34:12.210
and then for Lax-Wendroff.,00:34:12.210,00:34:14.290
"OK, so for upwind the
flux turns out to be--",00:34:14.290,00:34:18.120
"F turns out to be 1/2
of-- because it's at this,",00:34:18.120,00:34:24.730
"this is f_(j+1/2), really.",00:34:24.730,00:34:26.720
It's at the center point.,00:34:33.460,00:34:34.510
"The flux function will be--
I'll put in the a-- a delta t--",00:34:34.510,00:34:44.000
"sorry, a over 2 U_(j+1)
plus U_j, now, plus--",00:34:44.000,00:34:52.620
"or rather minus actually--
comes absolute value of a over 2",00:34:52.620,00:35:05.290
times u_(j+1) minus u_j.,00:35:05.290,00:35:08.710
"If we're patient we can track
down the two cases, a positive",00:35:12.510,00:35:19.660
"and a negative, and recognize
that this form switches",00:35:19.660,00:35:28.770
"direction correctly on
the difference method.",00:35:28.770,00:35:35.160
"So it keeps us upwind,
in other words.",00:35:35.160,00:35:37.230
"If the wind changes
direction our flux",00:35:37.230,00:35:39.750
"changes appropriately to
follow that direction.",00:35:39.750,00:35:44.390
So that's an OK flux function.,00:35:44.390,00:35:48.720
"It's a monotone one
and it's first order.",00:35:48.720,00:35:57.480
Now let me put in Lax-Wendroff.,00:35:57.480,00:36:00.190
What would Lax-Wendroff be?,00:36:00.190,00:36:02.420
"Would be the same, the same
upwind flux, if I call that UP",00:36:02.420,00:36:08.790
"for upwind and
then a correction,",00:36:08.790,00:36:12.310
"a Lax-Wendroff term that gets
the second-order accuracy.",00:36:12.310,00:36:19.670
"OK, and that turns out to be--
it turns out that I multiply",00:36:19.670,00:36:26.730
this term by that ratio r.,00:36:26.730,00:36:32.780
By the absolute value of r.,00:36:32.780,00:36:34.340
"So it turns out that it's--
the Lax-Wendroff thing,",00:36:34.340,00:36:39.700
"to get that extra accuracy,
you might remember,",00:36:39.700,00:36:42.240
"had an extra delta
t over delta x.",00:36:42.240,00:36:45.200
"And so it's this same
thing times a over 2.",00:36:45.200,00:36:51.150
"In the nonlinear case
it'll be f of u_(j+1).",00:36:51.150,00:36:55.730
f at u_(j+1) minus f at u_j.,00:36:59.050,00:37:03.200
"Next time, I'll come
back to this point",00:37:10.090,00:37:16.640
"and pin down this
more carefully.",00:37:16.640,00:37:24.040
"All I want to do
in completing today",00:37:24.040,00:37:26.450
"is introduce this idea
of a flux limiter.",00:37:26.450,00:37:35.210
"So what people say when
they look at Lax-Wendroff",00:37:35.210,00:37:42.920
"is that this term
that's been added on",00:37:42.920,00:37:49.010
"is fine in the case
of a smooth solution,",00:37:49.010,00:37:52.280
"but in that case of a
jump, like our picture",00:37:52.280,00:37:59.320
"here, that term is
increasing variation.",00:37:59.320,00:38:07.030
It's an anti-diffusion term.,00:38:07.030,00:38:09.650
"Instead of smoothing things
out the way F upwind does,",00:38:09.650,00:38:14.390
"that extra term has the
effect of increasing the jump.",00:38:14.390,00:38:21.830
It's anti-diffusive.,00:38:21.830,00:38:23.740
"And therefore, when
it's a significant term,",00:38:23.740,00:38:31.500
"the flux limiter
cuts back on it.",00:38:31.500,00:38:39.120
"The result will be
a numerical method,",00:38:39.120,00:38:41.070
"which is not linear
anymore even if we apply it",00:38:41.070,00:38:43.580
to a linear problem.,00:38:43.580,00:38:45.300
"The result won't
be strictly linear",00:38:45.300,00:38:49.190
"and it will produce
a profile that",00:38:49.190,00:38:54.400
doesn't have that oscillation.,00:38:54.400,00:38:56.960
So it has what we want.,00:38:56.960,00:39:00.630
"It gives us good answers
when the solution is smooth,",00:39:00.630,00:39:05.410
"it stays near the shock
the way Lax-Wendroff does,",00:39:05.410,00:39:08.820
but it doesn't oscillate.,00:39:08.820,00:39:11.490
"OK, so what's the flux limiter?",00:39:11.490,00:39:15.550
"The flux limiter is, I multiply
in here by some function,",00:39:15.550,00:39:20.000
"the limiter function, phi_(j+1)
and I multiply in here",00:39:20.000,00:39:26.590
by phi_j.,00:39:26.590,00:39:28.230
"In other words, there's
an extra factor,",00:39:28.230,00:39:33.050
this flux limiting factor.,00:39:33.050,00:39:36.500
"So the question is,
how to construct that?",00:39:36.500,00:39:40.090
"What formula do we use
for the flux limiter?",00:39:40.090,00:39:43.700
"So the flux limiter,
after lot of experiments",00:39:43.700,00:39:49.160
"is chosen to depend on--
so we want it to be 1.",00:39:49.160,00:40:00.540
So what do we want?,00:40:00.540,00:40:02.980
"We want it to be 1 or
close to 1 at smooth part",00:40:02.980,00:40:10.380
"and we want it to be greater
than 1 at a discontinuity.",00:40:10.380,00:40:17.480
"OK, so our question
is, how do you",00:40:20.080,00:40:23.030
identify that discontinuity?,00:40:23.030,00:40:25.420
"Well, the convenient
way has turned out",00:40:25.420,00:40:29.850
"to be look at the ratio--
look at differences.",00:40:29.850,00:40:35.980
"Look at the ratio of--
so what comes in here",00:40:35.980,00:40:40.000
"will be the ratio
r, say, j plus 1/2.",00:40:40.000,00:40:46.160
"That'll be the ratio of U,
say j plus 2 minus U_(j+1) 1",00:40:46.160,00:40:53.610
to U_(j+1) minus U_j.,00:40:53.610,00:40:58.090
All at time n.,00:40:58.090,00:41:00.910
"That ratio tells us--
that ratio is close to 1,",00:41:00.910,00:41:04.250
"if-- so the ratio r is close to
1 for smooth and our function,",00:41:04.250,00:41:16.870
"phi of r then, we want our
function phi, when the ratio is",00:41:16.870,00:41:23.620
"1, to give the value 1.",00:41:23.620,00:41:26.630
"So if I try to draw
a graph of-- let",00:41:26.630,00:41:29.270
"me draw a graph of people's flux
functions-- of the phi of r.",00:41:29.270,00:41:43.960
So here's a graph of phi of r.,00:41:43.960,00:41:47.180
"First on the graph I'll
put upwind and Lax-Wendroff",00:41:47.180,00:41:50.230
without anything.,00:41:50.230,00:41:51.890
"So Lax-Wendroff would take-- phi
Lax-Wendroff is identically 1.",00:41:51.890,00:41:59.640
"This is the ratio
r and this is phi.",00:41:59.640,00:42:02.660
"So Lax-Wendroff, before fixing,
had no flux limiter function",00:42:06.490,00:42:15.250
and it just had 1.,00:42:15.250,00:42:17.100
"And actually, if I can
keep the same formula,",00:42:17.100,00:42:22.680
phi_upwind would just be zero.,00:42:22.680,00:42:27.400
"Then it'll turn out that--
let me draw these ratios.",00:42:27.400,00:42:34.280
"There is a region here and
here where the flux limiter",00:42:34.280,00:42:45.750
is doing the right thing.,00:42:45.750,00:42:47.390
"So in that region it's
acting the right way.",00:42:47.390,00:42:53.710
"It's limiting the
anti-diffusive flux.",00:42:53.710,00:42:57.350
It's controlling the variation.,00:42:57.350,00:42:59.670
"It's controlling
the oscillation.",00:42:59.670,00:43:01.710
"So various people have
proposed-- let's see.",00:43:01.710,00:43:11.020
"No, I haven't got this right.",00:43:11.020,00:43:12.760
"I think it's-- because I
know that part is wrong",00:43:16.180,00:43:20.330
for Lax-Wendroff.,00:43:20.330,00:43:21.290
So maybe it's there.,00:43:21.290,00:43:22.270
"No, I've forgotten--
sorry that I'm",00:43:25.200,00:43:28.790
"not-- I've lost this because
I know that one possibility is",00:43:28.790,00:43:41.210
this as the flux limiter.,00:43:41.210,00:43:44.850
"One possibility
would be this one",00:43:44.850,00:43:48.850
"and then there's
another possibility that",00:43:48.850,00:43:51.600
is OK that goes through here.,00:43:51.600,00:43:54.440
"Let me stop for today with
this idea of a flux limiter",00:43:59.950,00:44:06.770
"and you see that it's a
task to fix the method",00:44:06.770,00:44:12.380
"to do the right
thing at smooth parts",00:44:12.380,00:44:15.650
"and also the right thing
at discontinuities.",00:44:15.650,00:44:18.090
"OK, I'll pick up
on that next time.",00:44:18.090,00:44:20.130
Thanks.,00:44:20.130,00:44:21.380
