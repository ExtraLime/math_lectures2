LINAN CHEN: Hello.,00:00:07.030,00:00:07.780
Welcome back to recitation.,00:00:07.780,00:00:09.870
"I'm sure you are
becoming more and more",00:00:09.870,00:00:12.050
"familiar with the
determinants of matrices.",00:00:12.050,00:00:15.220
"In the lecture, we also learned
the geometric interpretation",00:00:15.220,00:00:18.880
of the determinant.,00:00:18.880,00:00:20.780
"The absolute value of the
determinant of a matrix",00:00:20.780,00:00:24.660
"is simply equal to the volume
of the parallelepiped spanned",00:00:24.660,00:00:28.730
"by the row vectors
of that matrix.",00:00:28.730,00:00:32.040
"So today, we're going
to apply this fact",00:00:32.040,00:00:35.600
to solve the following problem.,00:00:35.600,00:00:38.420
"I have a tetrahedron,
T, in this 3D space.",00:00:38.420,00:00:43.990
"And the vertices of T are given
by O, which is the origin, A_1,",00:00:43.990,00:00:50.840
"A_2, and A_3.",00:00:50.840,00:00:54.040
"So I have highlighted
this tetrahedron",00:00:54.040,00:00:56.940
using the blue chalk.,00:00:56.940,00:00:59.190
So this is T.,00:00:59.190,00:01:03.270
"And our first goal is to
compute the volume of T",00:01:03.270,00:01:07.120
using the determinant.,00:01:07.120,00:01:10.330
"And the second part is:
if I fix A_1 and A_2,",00:01:10.330,00:01:15.260
"but move A_3 to another
point, A_3 prime, which",00:01:15.260,00:01:20.130
"is given by this
coordinate, I ask you",00:01:20.130,00:01:23.380
to compute the volume again.,00:01:23.380,00:01:26.370
OK.,00:01:26.370,00:01:27.130
"So since we want to use the fact
that the determinant is related",00:01:27.130,00:01:32.120
"to the volume, we have to
figure out which volume",00:01:32.120,00:01:36.280
we should be looking at.,00:01:36.280,00:01:37.680
"We know that the
determinant is related",00:01:37.680,00:01:40.660
"to the volume of
a parallelepiped.",00:01:40.660,00:01:43.060
"But here, we only
have a tetrahedron.",00:01:43.060,00:01:46.220
"So the first goal should be to
find out which parallelepiped",00:01:46.220,00:01:50.010
you should be working with.,00:01:50.010,00:01:52.230
"OK, why don't you hit pause and
try to work it out yourself.",00:01:52.230,00:01:56.810
"You can sketch the
parallelepiped on this picture.",00:01:56.810,00:02:00.510
"And I will return in a while
and continue working with you.",00:02:00.510,00:02:03.780
All right.,00:02:12.960,00:02:13.640
How did your computation go?,00:02:13.640,00:02:15.990
"Now let's complete
this picture together.",00:02:15.990,00:02:19.520
"As we were saying, we
need a parallelepiped",00:02:19.520,00:02:22.930
"so that we can use the fact
that the determinant is",00:02:22.930,00:02:25.800
related to the volume.,00:02:25.800,00:02:27.790
"Here, I have a tetrahedron.",00:02:27.790,00:02:30.700
"And let's look at these three
edges, OA_1, OA_2, and OA_3.",00:02:30.700,00:02:39.230
All of them meet at the origin.,00:02:39.230,00:02:42.640
"So why don't we just consider
the parallelepiped spanned",00:02:42.640,00:02:46.720
by those same three edges?,00:02:46.720,00:02:49.430
"It's a natural choice,
because at least it",00:02:49.430,00:02:51.870
shares three edges with T.,00:02:51.870,00:02:54.116
"OK, now let's move on
to this picture here.",00:02:54.116,00:02:58.500
"As you can see, I have
drawn this parallelepiped",00:02:58.500,00:03:01.930
in red chalk.,00:03:01.930,00:03:05.180
"So the blue part
is my original T.",00:03:05.180,00:03:11.080
"And the red part,
let me call it P.",00:03:11.080,00:03:14.710
"It's the parallelepiped spanned
by edges OA_1, OA_2, and OA_3.",00:03:14.710,00:03:21.830
"So that's the parallelepiped
that I'm going to work with.",00:03:21.830,00:03:25.870
"Now the next step is to
relate the volume of T",00:03:25.870,00:03:30.230
"to the volume of P. OK,
let's recall together",00:03:30.230,00:03:34.510
"what is the volume
of a tetrahedron.",00:03:34.510,00:03:37.820
"We note that the
volume of a tetrahedron",00:03:37.820,00:03:45.100
"is going to be equal to
1/3 of the area of the base",00:03:45.100,00:03:51.470
"times the height, right?",00:03:51.470,00:03:54.260
"Of course, you can choose any
side, any face to be the base.",00:03:54.260,00:03:59.800
"But for convenience, we're going
to choose the triangle OA_1A_2",00:03:59.800,00:04:05.770
"to be the base of T.
So the volume of T",00:04:05.770,00:04:09.540
"is going to be equal to 1/3
times the area of triangle",00:04:09.540,00:04:15.810
OA_1A_2.,00:04:15.810,00:04:16.310
"So I use this A to
indicate the area.",00:04:18.950,00:04:22.540
Then times the height.,00:04:22.540,00:04:24.430
"Well, if I choose
this to be my base,",00:04:24.430,00:04:27.760
then this A_3 becomes the apex.,00:04:27.760,00:04:31.560
"Then the height is simply
equal to the distance from A_3",00:04:31.560,00:04:35.820
to the triangle OA_1A_2.,00:04:35.820,00:04:39.000
"Let me use letter h to
denote this quantity.",00:04:39.000,00:04:43.220
So that's the height.,00:04:43.220,00:04:44.910
"And the volume of
T is equal to 1/3",00:04:44.910,00:04:47.950
"of the product of the area
of the base times the height.",00:04:47.950,00:04:52.390
"OK, this is the volume of T. Now
let's see what the volume of P",00:04:52.390,00:04:59.960
is.,00:04:59.960,00:05:01.250
So P is a parallelepiped.,00:05:01.250,00:05:03.790
"The volume of a
parallelepiped is simply",00:05:03.790,00:05:06.760
"equal to the area of the
base times its height.",00:05:06.760,00:05:12.800
"This time, which face would
you choose to be the base?",00:05:12.800,00:05:17.020
"Well, of course, you would like
to choose this parallelogram",00:05:17.020,00:05:21.320
"to be the base because it
contains the base of T.",00:05:21.320,00:05:26.200
"If we do so, so we want to
choose this parallelogram",00:05:26.200,00:05:31.570
"to be the base, then
what is the area of this?",00:05:31.570,00:05:35.920
"Well, it clearly contains two
copies of the triangle OA_1A_2.",00:05:35.920,00:05:40.590
"So the area of the
parallelogram is simply",00:05:43.460,00:05:46.550
"equal to twice the area
of the triangle OA_1A_2.",00:05:46.550,00:05:51.115
Then what is the height of P?,00:05:56.410,00:05:59.600
"Again, if you choose
this face to be the base,",00:05:59.600,00:06:03.570
then A_3 becomes the apex again.,00:06:03.570,00:06:07.360
"Then the height of
the parallelepiped",00:06:07.360,00:06:10.210
"is equal to the
distance from A_3",00:06:10.210,00:06:13.240
"to the base, which is the
same as the distance from A_3",00:06:13.240,00:06:17.760
to triangle OA_1A_2.,00:06:17.760,00:06:20.930
"So here, the height
is also equal to h.",00:06:20.930,00:06:25.050
"Now you can compare
these two formulae.",00:06:28.390,00:06:31.860
"You see that volume
of T is simply",00:06:31.860,00:06:36.800
"equal to 1/6 of
volume of P. That's",00:06:36.800,00:06:44.640
"the connection
between the volume",00:06:44.640,00:06:47.080
"of the tetrahedron with the
volume of the parallelepiped.",00:06:47.080,00:06:51.170
"In order to compute
the volume of T,",00:06:51.170,00:06:53.690
"we only need to compute
the volume of P.",00:06:53.690,00:06:57.530
"Now let's compute the volume
of this parallelepiped.",00:06:57.530,00:07:00.380
"We know that it's related to
the determinant of a matrix.",00:07:03.370,00:07:10.280
"And the row vectors
of that matrix",00:07:10.280,00:07:13.150
are given by these three edges.,00:07:13.150,00:07:17.850
"So because all of
them start from 0,",00:07:17.850,00:07:20.910
"we only need the coordinate
of A_1, A_2, and A_3.",00:07:20.910,00:07:25.090
"So here, volume of P is
equal to the absolute value.",00:07:25.090,00:07:30.730
"So don't forget the
absolute value sign.",00:07:30.730,00:07:33.320
"Absolute value of the
determinant of a three",00:07:33.320,00:07:37.590
by three matrix.,00:07:37.590,00:07:39.180
"So we just need to copy the
coordinates of the vertices",00:07:39.180,00:07:43.020
down here.,00:07:43.020,00:07:44.340
"The first one is [2, 2, -1].",00:07:44.340,00:07:49.280
These two are too close.,00:07:49.280,00:07:50.400
-1.,00:07:54.100,00:07:55.240
"And A_2 is [1, 3, 0].",00:07:55.240,00:08:01.084
"A3 is [-1, 1, 4].",00:08:01.084,00:08:07.070
"The absolute value
of this determinant.",00:08:07.070,00:08:11.440
"And if you compute this, this
is a three by three matrix.",00:08:11.440,00:08:17.290
"The determinant should
be easy to compute.",00:08:17.290,00:08:20.010
And the result should be 12.,00:08:20.010,00:08:25.900
"So that's the volume
of P, which means",00:08:25.900,00:08:29.780
"the volume of the tetrahedron
T is equal to 12 over 6,",00:08:29.780,00:08:35.370
which is 2.,00:08:35.370,00:08:38.659
Did you get the correct answer?,00:08:38.659,00:08:41.240
"OK, so in order to
compute the volume of T,",00:08:41.240,00:08:45.120
"we have related to
a parallelepiped, P,",00:08:45.120,00:08:48.990
which contains T. All right.,00:08:48.990,00:08:52.010
"Now let's look at
the second part.",00:08:52.010,00:08:54.300
"The second part says that if
I keep A_1 and A_2 unchanged,",00:08:54.300,00:08:59.400
"but I move A_3 to
a new point-- so A3",00:08:59.400,00:09:04.750
"is going to be moved to a
point given by A_3 prime,",00:09:04.750,00:09:09.630
"and the coordinate is
-201, -199, and 104.",00:09:09.630,00:09:23.310
"And I'm asking you
to compute the volume",00:09:23.310,00:09:26.490
of the new tetrahedron.,00:09:26.490,00:09:29.180
"Well as you can see,
this point seems",00:09:29.180,00:09:32.280
to be far away from the origin.,00:09:32.280,00:09:35.590
"I'm not even able to
draw this point here.",00:09:35.590,00:09:39.610
"But you can imagine, as
this point goes far away",00:09:39.610,00:09:42.770
"from the origin,
this spike is going",00:09:42.770,00:09:45.440
to become more and more pointy.,00:09:45.440,00:09:47.480
"In other words, the entire
tetrahedron looks more and more",00:09:47.480,00:09:50.770
like a needle.,00:09:50.770,00:09:52.010
"But nonetheless, we
can use the same method",00:09:52.010,00:09:54.610
to compute the volume.,00:09:54.610,00:09:56.670
"So we follow the same
idea, the volume of T",00:09:56.670,00:10:03.180
"is going to be equal to
1/6 of the volume of P.",00:10:03.180,00:10:08.420
"And in this case,
that's going to become",00:10:08.420,00:10:11.350
"the absolute value of the
determinant of a three",00:10:11.350,00:10:15.950
"by three matrix
whose row vectors are",00:10:15.950,00:10:20.010
given by these three edges.,00:10:20.010,00:10:23.250
"So in this case, we again
copy down the coordinates",00:10:23.250,00:10:27.030
of three vertices.,00:10:27.030,00:10:29.070
"The first one is [2, 2, -1].",00:10:29.070,00:10:33.250
"The second one is [1, 3, 0].",00:10:33.250,00:10:36.300
"The third one should become
this, so [-201, 199, 104].",00:10:36.300,00:10:48.850
OK.,00:10:48.850,00:10:49.870
"That should give me the
volume of the new tetrahedron.",00:10:49.870,00:10:53.840
"Let me call it T prime
just to differentiate it",00:10:53.840,00:10:57.480
from the previous tetrahedron.,00:10:57.480,00:10:59.980
"And of course, you can compute
this determinant explicitly.",00:10:59.980,00:11:04.950
"If you do so, you will see
the answer should be 2 again.",00:11:04.950,00:11:12.330
"But in fact, there is
a way that you can just",00:11:12.330,00:11:16.400
"read out the answer directly
without any real computation.",00:11:16.400,00:11:22.390
"Let's pay attention
to the last row.",00:11:22.390,00:11:24.620
"In other words, let's pay
attention to this new A_3,",00:11:24.620,00:11:28.660
"well, A_3 prime.",00:11:28.660,00:11:31.700
What do you observe here?,00:11:31.700,00:11:34.430
"A_3 prime, if you consider the
difference between A_3 and A_3",00:11:34.430,00:11:39.940
"prime, in other words, if you
consider how much you have",00:11:39.940,00:11:42.990
"moved your apex, you will
see that's equal to -100*A_1.",00:11:42.990,00:11:48.150
Right?,00:11:52.230,00:11:52.870
"So A_3 is [-1, 1, 4].",00:11:52.870,00:11:57.690
A_3 prime is this.,00:11:57.690,00:11:59.690
"That's exactly equal
to -100 times A_1.",00:11:59.690,00:12:04.720
What does that mean?,00:12:04.720,00:12:06.650
"Well from the point
of view of the matrix,",00:12:06.650,00:12:10.080
"you are subtracting from the
original third row 100 times",00:12:10.080,00:12:16.620
the first row.,00:12:16.620,00:12:18.190
"But this row operation does
not change the determinant.",00:12:18.190,00:12:22.470
"In other words, you know that
this determinant should be",00:12:22.470,00:12:26.090
the same as the previous one.,00:12:26.090,00:12:27.790
So you can write out 2 directly.,00:12:27.790,00:12:31.980
"From this picture, we
can also see that fact.",00:12:31.980,00:12:36.080
"So from this picture, we
know that this section",00:12:36.080,00:12:39.610
"is saying that I need to move
A_3 in the inverse direction",00:12:39.610,00:12:46.520
of A_1 by 100 times A_1.,00:12:46.520,00:12:50.730
"So you're moving
A_3 parallel to A_1.",00:12:50.730,00:12:54.500
"But it doesn't matter how
far you've moved your apex.",00:12:54.500,00:12:58.410
"You're moving in a way
that remains parallel",00:12:58.410,00:13:00.800
"to the base, which is saying
that this movement does not",00:13:00.800,00:13:05.160
change the height.,00:13:05.160,00:13:07.210
"Since A_1 and A_2 are
fixed, your base is fixed,",00:13:07.210,00:13:12.780
"and you're not
changing the height.",00:13:12.780,00:13:14.730
"So of course, the
volume is not changing.",00:13:14.730,00:13:17.660
"That's also a
reason, another way",00:13:17.660,00:13:20.450
"to see that the
volume of T prime",00:13:20.450,00:13:22.700
"is simply equal to
the volume of T.",00:13:22.700,00:13:26.208
"OK, this completes this problem.",00:13:26.208,00:13:29.580
"I hope this example
was helpful to you.",00:13:29.580,00:13:32.450
"And we should keep in mind that
