OK.,00:00:07.840,00:00:08.460
Good.,00:00:08.460,00:00:09.050
"The final class in linear
algebra at MIT this Fall",00:00:09.050,00:00:15.540
is to review the whole course.,00:00:15.540,00:00:18.430
"And, you know the best
way I know how to review",00:00:18.430,00:00:23.890
"is to take old exams and just
think through the problems.",00:00:23.890,00:00:30.410
"So it will be a three-hour
exam next Thursday.",00:00:30.410,00:00:33.680
"Nobody will be able to take an
exam before Thursday, anybody",00:00:37.380,00:00:41.240
"who needs to take it
in some different way",00:00:41.240,00:00:44.120
"after Thursday should
see me next Monday.",00:00:44.120,00:00:47.380
I'll be in my office Monday.,00:00:47.380,00:00:49.310
OK.,00:00:49.310,00:00:52.190
"May I just read
out some problems",00:00:52.190,00:00:54.330
"and, let me bring the board
down, and let's start.",00:00:54.330,00:01:06.400
OK.,00:01:06.400,00:01:08.270
Here's a question.,00:01:08.270,00:01:12.140
This is about a 3-by-n matrix.,00:01:12.140,00:01:18.100
"And we're given --
so we're given --",00:01:18.100,00:01:21.900
"given -- A x equals 1
0 0 has no solution.",00:01:21.900,00:01:30.160
"And we're also given A x equals
0 1 0 has exactly one solution.",00:01:33.380,00:01:45.010
OK.,00:01:45.010,00:01:45.510
"So you can probably
anticipate my first question,",00:01:48.090,00:01:51.970
what can you tell me about m?,00:01:51.970,00:01:55.170
"It's an m-by-n matrix
of rank r, as always,",00:01:55.170,00:01:59.190
"what can you tell me
about those three numbers?",00:01:59.190,00:02:02.910
"So what can you tell me about
m, the number of rows, n,",00:02:02.910,00:02:12.160
"the number of columns,
and r, the rank?",00:02:12.160,00:02:16.931
OK.,00:02:16.931,00:02:17.430
"See, do you want to
tell me first what m is?",00:02:20.100,00:02:23.430
How many rows in this matrix?,00:02:23.430,00:02:25.275
"Must be three, right?",00:02:28.610,00:02:32.940
"We can't tell what n
is, but we can certainly",00:02:32.940,00:02:40.610
tell that m is three.,00:02:40.610,00:02:43.030
OK.,00:02:43.030,00:02:43.530
"And, what do these
things tell us?",00:02:43.530,00:02:46.830
Let's take them one at a time.,00:02:46.830,00:02:49.750
"When I discover that some
equation has no solution,",00:02:49.750,00:02:53.740
"that there's some right-hand
side with no answer,",00:02:53.740,00:02:56.880
"what does that tell me about
the rank of the matrix?",00:02:56.880,00:03:01.950
It's smaller m.,00:03:06.430,00:03:11.850
Is that right?,00:03:11.850,00:03:13.820
"If there is no
solution, that tells me",00:03:13.820,00:03:19.840
"that some rows of the matrix
are combinations of other rows.",00:03:19.840,00:03:26.060
"Because if I had a
pivot in every row,",00:03:26.060,00:03:30.850
"then I would certainly be
able to solve the system.",00:03:30.850,00:03:34.440
"I would have particular
solutions and all the good",00:03:34.440,00:03:38.410
"So any time that there's a
system with no solutions,",00:03:38.410,00:03:43.170
"stuff. that tells me
that r must be below m.",00:03:43.170,00:03:46.260
"What about the fact that if,
when there is a solution,",00:03:46.260,00:03:50.450
there's only one?,00:03:50.450,00:03:52.330
What does that tell me?,00:03:52.330,00:03:53.320
"Well, normally there
would be one solution,",00:03:55.830,00:03:58.570
"and then we could add in
anything in the null space.",00:03:58.570,00:04:03.070
"So this is telling me the null
space only has the 0 vector in",00:04:03.070,00:04:07.110
it.,00:04:07.110,00:04:07.790
"There's just one
solution, period,",00:04:07.790,00:04:10.550
so what does that tell me?,00:04:10.550,00:04:11.820
"The null space has only
the zero vector in it?",00:04:11.820,00:04:15.000
"What does that tell me about
the relation of r to n?",00:04:15.000,00:04:18.959
"So this one solution
only, that means",00:04:18.959,00:04:22.640
"the null space of the matrix
must be just the zero vector,",00:04:22.640,00:04:29.120
"and what does that
tell me about r and n?",00:04:29.120,00:04:33.720
They're equal.,00:04:33.720,00:04:34.410
The columns are independent.,00:04:34.410,00:04:36.020
"So I've got, now, r equals
n, and r less than m,",00:04:36.020,00:04:39.730
and now I also know m is three.,00:04:39.730,00:04:42.760
"So those are really
the facts I know.",00:04:42.760,00:04:45.580
"n=r and those numbers
are smaller than three.",00:04:45.580,00:04:51.030
"Sorry, yes, yes.",00:04:51.030,00:04:52.820
"r is smaller than m, and
n, of course, is also.",00:04:52.820,00:04:58.030
"So I guess this summarizes
what we can tell.",00:04:58.030,00:05:01.830
"In fact, why not
give me a matrix --",00:05:01.830,00:05:05.870
"because I would often ask for
an example of such a matrix --",00:05:05.870,00:05:09.380
"can you give me a matrix
A that's an example?",00:05:09.380,00:05:13.150
That shows this possibility?,00:05:13.150,00:05:16.670
"Exactly, that
there's no solution",00:05:16.670,00:05:20.780
"with that right-hand side, but
there's exactly one solution",00:05:20.780,00:05:26.310
with this right-hand side.,00:05:26.310,00:05:28.420
"Anybody want to suggest
a matrix that does that?",00:05:28.420,00:05:33.400
Let's see.,00:05:33.400,00:05:34.560
"What do I -- what vector do
I want in the column space?",00:05:34.560,00:05:39.610
"I want zero, one, zero,
to be in the column space,",00:05:39.610,00:05:42.120
"because I'm able
to solve for that.",00:05:42.120,00:05:45.180
"So let's put zero, one,
zero in the column space.",00:05:45.180,00:05:47.930
"Actually, I could
stop right there.",00:05:47.930,00:05:51.290
"That would be a matrix with
m equal three, three rows,",00:05:51.290,00:05:56.480
"and n and r are both one,
rank one, one column,",00:05:56.480,00:06:04.160
"and, of course, there's
no solution to that one.",00:06:04.160,00:06:08.170
"So that's perfectly
good as it is.",00:06:08.170,00:06:10.290
"Or if you, kind of,
have a prejudice",00:06:10.290,00:06:12.990
"against matrices that
only have one column,",00:06:12.990,00:06:15.580
I'll accept a second,00:06:15.580,00:06:17.620
column.,00:06:17.620,00:06:18.310
"So what could I include
as a second column",00:06:18.310,00:06:20.970
"that would just be a different
answer but equally good?",00:06:20.970,00:06:26.020
"I could put this vector in the
column space, too, if I wanted.",00:06:26.020,00:06:31.420
"That would now be a case
with r=n=2, but, of course,",00:06:31.420,00:06:39.180
"three m eq- m is still
three, and this vector is not",00:06:39.180,00:06:43.850
in the column space.,00:06:43.850,00:06:45.540
"So you're -- this is just like
prompting us to remember all",00:06:45.540,00:06:49.470
"those things, column space,
null space, all that stuff.",00:06:49.470,00:06:53.660
"Now, I probably asked
a second question",00:06:53.660,00:06:56.250
about this type of thing.,00:06:56.250,00:06:58.200
OK.,00:07:01.370,00:07:01.940
"Oh, I even asked, write
down an example of a",00:07:01.940,00:07:04.260
"Ah. matrix that fits
the description.",00:07:04.260,00:07:07.080
Hm.,00:07:07.080,00:07:07.580
"I guess I haven't learned
anything in twenty-six years.",00:07:07.580,00:07:13.520
CK.,00:07:13.520,00:07:15.340
"Cross out all statements that
are false about any matrix with",00:07:15.340,00:07:19.910
"these -- so again, these are
-- this is the preliminary sta-",00:07:19.910,00:07:23.480
"these are the facts about my
matrix, this is one example.",00:07:23.480,00:07:27.600
"But, of course, by
having an example,",00:07:27.600,00:07:29.430
"it will be easy to check some
of these facts, or non-facts.",00:07:29.430,00:07:33.290
"Let me, let me write
down some, facts.",00:07:33.290,00:07:40.400
Some possible facts.,00:07:40.400,00:07:42.980
So this is really true or false.,00:07:42.980,00:07:45.580
"The determinant --
this is part one,",00:07:45.580,00:07:49.510
"the determinant of A transpose
A is the same as the determinant",00:07:49.510,00:07:55.300
of A A transpose.,00:07:55.300,00:07:57.670
Is that true or not?,00:07:57.670,00:07:59.820
"Second one, A transpose
A, is invertible.",00:07:59.820,00:08:05.230
Is invertible.,00:08:05.230,00:08:06.150
"Third possible fact, A A
transpose is positive definite.",00:08:09.810,00:08:17.270
"So you see how, on
an exam question,",00:08:22.070,00:08:24.090
"I try to connect the
different parts of the course.",00:08:24.090,00:08:28.490
"So, well, I mean,
the simplest way",00:08:28.490,00:08:33.360
"would be to try it with that
matrix as a good example,",00:08:33.360,00:08:38.260
"but maybe we can
answer, even directly.",00:08:38.260,00:08:43.730
Let me take number two first.,00:08:43.730,00:08:47.100
"Because I'm -- you know, I'm
very, very fond of that matrix,",00:08:47.100,00:08:51.910
A transpose A.,00:08:51.910,00:08:55.460
And when is it invertible?,00:08:55.460,00:09:01.170
"When is the matrix A
transpose A, invertible?",00:09:01.170,00:09:03.335
"The great thing is that I
can tell from the rank of A",00:09:08.130,00:09:12.500
"that I don't have to
multiply out A transpose A.",00:09:12.500,00:09:15.790
"A transpose A, is invertible --",00:09:15.790,00:09:18.990
"well, if A has a null space
other than the zero vector,",00:09:18.990,00:09:24.550
"then it -- it's -- no way
it's going to be invertible.",00:09:24.550,00:09:27.410
"But the beauty is, if the null
space of A is just the zero",00:09:27.410,00:09:31.440
"vector, so the fact
-- the key fact is,",00:09:31.440,00:09:34.480
"this is invertible if
r=n, by which I mean,",00:09:34.480,00:09:40.030
independent columns of A.,00:09:40.030,00:09:46.290
In A.,00:09:46.290,00:09:47.230
In the matrix A.,00:09:47.230,00:09:49.340
"If r=n -- if the matrix A
has independent columns,",00:09:49.340,00:09:53.320
"then this combination,
A transpose A,",00:09:53.320,00:09:56.200
"is square and still
that same null space,",00:09:56.200,00:10:00.000
"only the zero vector,
independent columns all good,",00:10:00.000,00:10:03.200
"and so, what's the true/false?",00:10:03.200,00:10:07.320
"Is it -- is this middle one T
or F for this, in this setup?",00:10:07.320,00:10:14.310
"Well, we discovered that --",00:10:14.310,00:10:17.650
"we discovered that -- that r
was n, from that second fact.",00:10:17.650,00:10:22.560
So this is a true.,00:10:22.560,00:10:24.610
That's a true.,00:10:24.610,00:10:26.190
"And, of course, A transpose
A, in this example,",00:10:26.190,00:10:29.330
"would probably be -- what
would A transpose A, be,",00:10:29.330,00:10:32.190
for that matrix?,00:10:32.190,00:10:32.870
"Can you multiply A
transpose A, and see what",00:10:35.610,00:10:38.000
it looks like for that matrix?,00:10:38.000,00:10:39.380
What shape would it be?,00:10:39.380,00:10:40.600
It will be two by two.,00:10:43.200,00:10:44.990
And what matrix will it be?,00:10:44.990,00:10:47.810
The identity.,00:10:47.810,00:10:48.660
"So, it checks out.",00:10:48.660,00:10:51.080
"OK, what about A A transpose?",00:10:51.080,00:10:52.925
"Well, depending
on the shape of A,",00:10:55.510,00:10:58.870
it could be good or not so good.,00:10:58.870,00:11:02.770
"It's always symmetric,
it's always square,",00:11:02.770,00:11:04.980
"but what's the size, now?",00:11:04.980,00:11:06.400
"This is three by n,
and this is n by three,",00:11:06.400,00:11:11.220
so the result is three by three.,00:11:11.220,00:11:13.270
Is it positive definite?,00:11:17.550,00:11:18.665
I don't think so.,00:11:21.760,00:11:23.160
False.,00:11:23.160,00:11:24.940
"If I multiply that by A
transpose, A A transpose,",00:11:24.940,00:11:29.870
what would the rank be?,00:11:29.870,00:11:31.480
"It would be the same as
the rank of A, that's --",00:11:31.480,00:11:36.620
it would be just rank two.,00:11:36.620,00:11:39.430
"And if it's three-by-three,
and it's only rank two,",00:11:39.430,00:11:42.200
"it's certainly not
positive definite.",00:11:42.200,00:11:44.270
"So what could I say
about A A transpose,",00:11:44.270,00:11:47.410
"if I wanted to, like, say
something true about it?",00:11:47.410,00:11:52.220
"It's true that it is
positive semi-definite.",00:11:52.220,00:11:56.360
"If I made this semi-definite,
it would always be true, always.",00:11:56.360,00:12:01.550
"But if I'm looking
for positive definite,",00:12:01.550,00:12:03.950
"then I'm looking at the null
space of whatever's here,",00:12:03.950,00:12:08.990
"and, in this case,
it's got a null space.",00:12:08.990,00:12:14.720
"So A, A -- eh, shall
we just figure it out,",00:12:14.720,00:12:17.200
here?,00:12:17.200,00:12:17.720
"A A transpose, for that
matrix, will be three-by-three.",00:12:17.720,00:12:22.090
"If I multiplied
A by A transpose,",00:12:22.090,00:12:25.340
what would the first row be?,00:12:25.340,00:12:26.600
"All zeroes, right?",00:12:29.990,00:12:31.960
"First row of A A
transpose, could only",00:12:31.960,00:12:34.970
"be all zeroes, so it's probably
a one there and a one there,",00:12:34.970,00:12:40.000
or something like that.,00:12:40.000,00:12:41.950
"But, I don't even
know if that's right.",00:12:41.950,00:12:45.860
"But it's all zeroes
there, so it's certainly",00:12:45.860,00:12:48.570
not positive definite.,00:12:48.570,00:12:49.700
"Let me not put anything up
I'm not sh- don't check.",00:12:49.700,00:12:53.550

"Oh, well, I guess --",00:12:54.930,00:12:58.290
"that's a sort of
tricky question.",00:12:58.290,00:13:01.470
"Is it true or
false in this case?",00:13:01.470,00:13:04.620
"It's false, apparently, because
A transpose A, is invertible,",00:13:04.620,00:13:08.810

one, and we got a false,",00:13:08.810,00:13:13.500
"we got a z- we got
a non-invertible one",00:13:13.500,00:13:15.960
for this one.,00:13:15.960,00:13:16.530
"So actually, this one
is false, number one.",00:13:16.530,00:13:22.060
"That surprises us,
actually, because it's,",00:13:22.060,00:13:24.590
"I mean, why was it tricky?",00:13:24.590,00:13:25.930
"Because what is true
about determinants?",00:13:25.930,00:13:30.120
"This would be true if
those matrices were square.",00:13:30.120,00:13:34.110
"If I have two square matrices,
A and any other matrix B,",00:13:34.110,00:13:39.530
"could be A transpose, could
be somebody else's matrix.",00:13:39.530,00:13:43.670
"Then it would be true that
the determinant of B A",00:13:43.670,00:13:47.090
"would equal the
determinant of A B.",00:13:47.090,00:13:49.610
"But if the matrices are not
square and it would actually be",00:13:49.610,00:13:54.420
"true that it would be equal
-- that this would equal",00:13:54.420,00:13:59.010
"the determinant of A times the
determinant of A transpose.",00:13:59.010,00:14:03.940
"We could even split up those
two separate determinants.",00:14:03.940,00:14:06.610
"And, of course,
those would be equal.",00:14:06.610,00:14:09.080
But only when A is square.,00:14:09.080,00:14:11.920
"So that's just, that's a
question that rests on the,",00:14:11.920,00:14:15.860
"the falseness rests on the
fact that the matrix isn't",00:14:15.860,00:14:18.970
square in the first place.,00:14:18.970,00:14:20.530
"OK, good.",00:14:20.530,00:14:22.700
Let's see.,00:14:22.700,00:14:25.470
"Oh, now, even asks more.",00:14:25.470,00:14:28.860
"Prove that A transpose
y equals c --",00:14:28.860,00:14:34.370
"hah-God, it's -- this
question goes on and on.",00:14:34.370,00:14:37.760
"now I ask you about
A transpose y=c.",00:14:40.830,00:14:44.130
"So I'm asking you
about the equation --",00:14:46.780,00:14:48.650
about the matrix A transpose.,00:14:48.650,00:14:51.100
"And I want you to prove that
it has at least one solution --",00:14:51.100,00:14:57.890
"one solution for every c,
every right-hand side c,",00:14:57.890,00:15:04.160
"and, in fact -- in fact,
infinitely many solutions",00:15:04.160,00:15:13.640
for every c.,00:15:13.640,00:15:16.630
OK.,00:15:16.630,00:15:17.910
"Well, none -- none
of this is difficult,",00:15:17.910,00:15:20.170
"but, it's been a little while.",00:15:20.170,00:15:25.470
So we just have to think again.,00:15:25.470,00:15:27.900
"When I have a system of
equations -- this is --",00:15:27.900,00:15:30.980
"this matrix A transpose is now,
instead of being three by n,",00:15:30.980,00:15:37.690
"it's n by three, it's n by m.",00:15:37.690,00:15:40.970
Of course.,00:15:40.970,00:15:43.470
"To show that a system has
at least one solution,",00:15:43.470,00:15:53.900
"when does this, when
does this system --",00:15:53.900,00:15:56.020
"when is the system
always solvable?",00:15:56.020,00:15:57.760
"When it has full row rank,
when the rows are independent.",00:16:01.040,00:16:06.810
"Here, we have n rows,
and that's the rank.",00:16:06.810,00:16:12.100
"So at least one solution,
because the number",00:16:12.100,00:16:19.450
"of rows, which is n,
for the transpose,",00:16:19.450,00:16:22.500
"is equal to r, the rank.",00:16:22.500,00:16:24.300
"This A transpose
had independent rows",00:16:27.490,00:16:30.860
"because A had independent
columns, right?",00:16:30.860,00:16:34.530
"The original A had independent
columns, when we transpose it,",00:16:34.530,00:16:41.480
"it has independent rows, so
there's at least one solution.",00:16:41.480,00:16:44.430
"But now, how do I even know
that there are infinitely",00:16:44.430,00:16:46.660
many solutions?,00:16:46.660,00:16:48.050
"Oh, what do I --",00:16:48.050,00:16:49.260
"I want to know something
about the null space.",00:16:49.260,00:16:52.280
"What's the dimension of the
null space of A transpose?",00:16:52.280,00:16:57.390
"So the answer has got
to be the dimension",00:16:57.390,00:17:00.100
"of the null space of
A transpose, what's",00:17:00.100,00:17:03.850
the general fact?,00:17:03.850,00:17:06.119
"If A is an m by n
matrix of rank r,",00:17:06.119,00:17:10.790
"what's the dimension
of A transpose?",00:17:10.790,00:17:14.260
The null space of A transpose?,00:17:14.260,00:17:15.970
"Do you remember that
little fourth subspace",00:17:15.970,00:17:20.470
"that's tagging along
down in our big picture?",00:17:20.470,00:17:24.050
It's dimension was m-r.,00:17:24.050,00:17:26.497
"And, that's bigger than zero.",00:17:30.780,00:17:32.630
m is bigger than r.,00:17:32.630,00:17:35.610
"So there's a lot
in that null space.",00:17:35.610,00:17:37.520
"So there's always one
solution because n i- this",00:17:44.520,00:17:47.790
is speaking about A transpose.,00:17:47.790,00:17:49.230
"So for A transpose, the roles
of m and n are reversed,",00:17:52.880,00:17:55.730
"of course, so I'm --",00:17:55.730,00:17:57.540
"keep in mind that this
board was about A transpose,",00:17:57.540,00:18:01.430
"so the roles -- so it's the
null space of a transpose,",00:18:01.430,00:18:04.880
"and there are m-r
free variables.",00:18:04.880,00:18:08.590
"OK, that's, like,
just some, review.",00:18:08.590,00:18:13.630
"Can I take another problem
that's also sort of --",00:18:13.630,00:18:17.030
"suppose the matrix A has
three columns, v1, v2, v3.",00:18:17.030,00:18:24.710

of the matrix.",00:18:24.710,00:18:28.880
All right.,00:18:28.880,00:18:31.140
Question A.,00:18:31.140,00:18:33.500
Solve Ax=v1-v2+v3.,00:18:33.500,00:18:36.827

seeing the most --",00:18:53.960,00:18:57.520
"the one absolutely
essential fact about matrix",00:18:57.520,00:19:04.380
"multiplication,
how does it work,",00:19:04.380,00:19:06.530
"when we do it a column at a
time, the very, very first day,",00:19:06.530,00:19:10.760
"way back in September, we
did multiplication a column",00:19:10.760,00:19:13.800
at a time.,00:19:13.800,00:19:14.590
So what's x?,00:19:14.590,00:19:16.190
Just tell me?,00:19:16.190,00:19:18.070
"One minus one, one.",00:19:18.070,00:19:19.250
Thanks.,00:19:19.250,00:19:19.820
OK.,00:19:19.820,00:19:20.740
Everybody's got that.,00:19:20.740,00:19:22.950
OK?,00:19:22.950,00:19:23.550
"Then the next question is,
suppose that combination is",00:19:23.550,00:19:26.750
zero --,00:19:26.750,00:19:28.130
"oh, yes, OK, so
question (b) says --",00:19:28.130,00:19:31.560
"part (b) says, suppose
this thing is zero.",00:19:31.560,00:19:42.730
Suppose that's zero.,00:19:42.730,00:19:45.380
Then the solution is not unique.,00:19:45.380,00:19:48.520
Suppose I want true or false.,00:19:48.520,00:19:51.730
-- and a reason.,00:19:51.730,00:19:54.440
"Suppose this
combination is zero.",00:19:54.440,00:20:00.330
v1-v2+v3.,00:20:00.330,00:20:02.170
"Show that -- what
does that tell me?",00:20:02.170,00:20:06.640
"So it's a separate
question, maybe",00:20:06.640,00:20:08.210
"I sort of saved time
by writing it that way,",00:20:08.210,00:20:11.880
"but it's a totally
separate question.",00:20:11.880,00:20:14.620
"If I have a matrix, and I know
that column one minus column",00:20:14.620,00:20:19.280
"two plus column
three is zero, what",00:20:19.280,00:20:23.160
"does that tell me about whether
the solution is unique or not?",00:20:23.160,00:20:33.810
Is there more than one solution?,00:20:33.810,00:20:36.420
What's uniqueness about?,00:20:36.420,00:20:40.330
"Uniqueness is about,
is there anything",00:20:40.330,00:20:42.420
"in the null space, right?",00:20:42.420,00:20:44.720
"The solution is
unique when there's",00:20:44.720,00:20:46.490
"nobody in the null space
except the zero vector.",00:20:46.490,00:20:49.550
"And, if that's zero, then this
guy would be in the null space.",00:20:49.550,00:20:57.670
"So if this were zero, then this
x is in the null space of A.",00:20:57.670,00:21:08.020
"So solutions are never
unique, because I could always",00:21:08.020,00:21:18.750
"add that to any solution,
and Ax wouldn't change.",00:21:18.750,00:21:26.890
So it's always that question.,00:21:26.890,00:21:29.610
"Is there somebody
in the null space?",00:21:29.610,00:21:31.760
OK.,00:21:31.760,00:21:33.620
"Oh, now, here's a totally
different question.",00:21:33.620,00:21:37.370
"Suppose those three vectors,
v1, v2, v3, are orthonormal.",00:21:37.370,00:21:43.770

for orthonormal vectors.",00:21:43.770,00:21:48.340
"OK, so part (c),
forget part (b).",00:21:48.340,00:21:51.680
c.,00:21:51.680,00:21:52.410
"If v1, v2, v3,
are orthonormal --",00:21:52.410,00:22:05.040
"so that I would usually
have called them q1, q2, q3.",00:22:05.040,00:22:08.725
"Now, what combination --
oh, here's a nice question,",00:22:11.540,00:22:16.420
if I say so myself --,00:22:16.420,00:22:19.020
"what combination of v1
and v2 is closest to v3?",00:22:19.020,00:22:24.280
"What point on the
plane of v1 and v2",00:22:24.280,00:22:28.120
"is the closest point to v3 if
these vectors are orthonormal?",00:22:28.120,00:22:33.100
So let me --,00:22:33.100,00:22:33.750
"I'll start the sentence -- then
the combination something times",00:22:33.750,00:22:41.610
"v1 plus something times v2 is
the closest combination to v3?",00:22:41.610,00:22:51.570
And what's the answer?,00:22:51.570,00:22:53.860
"What's the closest vector
on that plane to v3?",00:22:53.860,00:22:57.150
Zeroes.,00:22:57.150,00:23:00.030
Right.,00:23:00.030,00:23:01.480
"We just imagine the x, y,
z axes, the v1, v2, th- v3",00:23:01.480,00:23:07.240
"could be the standard
basis, the x, y, z vectors,",00:23:07.240,00:23:13.380
"and, of course, the point on
the xy plane that's closest",00:23:13.380,00:23:19.090
to v3 on the z axis is zero.,00:23:19.090,00:23:24.090
"So if we're orthonormal,
then the projection",00:23:24.090,00:23:28.880
"of v3 onto that plane
is perpendicular,",00:23:28.880,00:23:34.690
it hits right at zero.,00:23:34.690,00:23:36.440
"OK, so that's like a quick --",00:23:36.440,00:23:39.850
"you know, an easy question,
but still brings it out.",00:23:39.850,00:23:43.890
OK.,00:23:43.890,00:23:45.110
"Let me see what, shall I
write down a Markov matrix,",00:23:45.110,00:23:56.720

this board, and leave that for",00:32:05.810,00:32:09.770

two-by-two matrices.",00:32:11.260,00:32:16.020

there isn't such a matrix.",00:32:19.610,00:32:23.670
All right.,00:32:23.670,00:32:24.640
Here we go.,00:32:24.640,00:32:25.180
First -- so two-by-twos.,00:32:25.180,00:32:28.240

projection onto the line",00:32:28.240,00:32:36.550
"through A equals
four minus three.",00:32:36.550,00:32:41.820

projection matrix",00:32:46.190,00:32:49.600
I'm looking for.,00:32:49.600,00:32:50.430
And what's the formula for it?,00:32:53.520,00:32:56.280
"What's the formula for the
projection matrix P onto a line",00:32:56.280,00:33:00.950
"through A. And then we'd just
plug in this particular A.",00:33:00.950,00:33:03.960
Do you remember that formula?,00:33:03.960,00:33:08.050
"There's an A and an A
transpose, and normally we",00:33:08.050,00:33:14.150
"would have an A transpose
A inverse in the middle,",00:33:14.150,00:33:17.030
"but here we've just got numbers,
so we just divide by it.",00:33:17.030,00:33:20.730
"And then plug in A
and we've got it.",00:33:20.730,00:33:25.780
"So, equals.",00:33:25.780,00:33:26.850
OK.,00:33:26.850,00:33:28.290
You can put in the numbers.,00:33:28.290,00:33:30.390
"Trivial, right.",00:33:30.390,00:33:31.790
OK.,00:33:31.790,00:33:32.370
Number two.,00:33:32.370,00:33:33.190
So this is a new problem.,00:33:38.440,00:33:39.900

"What's the matrix, then?",00:34:10.080,00:34:11.590
What's A?,00:34:11.590,00:34:12.210
"Here was a formula,
then we just put",00:34:17.310,00:34:19.090

the formula here,",00:34:19.090,00:34:21.610
"into which we'll just
put the given numbers?",00:34:21.610,00:34:26.270
"It's the S lambda
S inverse, right?",00:34:26.270,00:34:30.840
"So it's S, which is
this eigenvector matrix,",00:34:30.840,00:34:35.290
"it's the lambda, which
is the eigenvalue matrix,",00:34:35.290,00:34:41.090
"it's the S inverse, whatever
that turns out to be,",00:34:41.090,00:34:44.790
let me just leave it as inverse.,00:34:44.790,00:34:46.369
"That has to be it, right?",00:34:49.489,00:34:52.000
"Because if we went in
the other direction,",00:34:52.000,00:34:54.409
"that matrix S would diagonalize
A to produce lambda.",00:34:54.409,00:35:00.150
So it's S lambda S inverse.,00:35:00.150,00:35:02.340
Good.,00:35:02.340,00:35:03.200

something different.",00:35:33.470,00:35:37.060

"It could be skew-symmetric
like one minus one, like that.",00:37:01.140,00:37:11.050

and it has slope minus one,",00:41:19.340,00:41:25.860
so it's something like that.,00:41:25.860,00:41:28.590
Great.,00:41:28.590,00:41:29.370
OK.,00:41:29.370,00:41:29.930
"Now, finally -- and this
completes the course --",00:41:29.930,00:41:36.680
"find a different vector
b, not all zeroes,",00:41:36.680,00:41:41.140
"for which the least square
solution would be zero.",00:41:41.140,00:41:45.310
"So I want you to
find a different B",00:41:45.310,00:41:50.140
"so that the least square
solution changes to all zeroes.",00:41:50.140,00:41:54.915
"So tell me what I'm
really looking for here.",00:42:00.530,00:42:04.360
"I'm looking for a b where the
best combination of these two",00:42:04.360,00:42:08.640
columns is the zero combination.,00:42:08.640,00:42:11.780
"So what kind of a
vector b I looking for?",00:42:11.780,00:42:15.200
"I'm looking for
a vector b that's",00:42:15.200,00:42:16.780
orthogonal to those columns.,00:42:16.780,00:42:19.230
"It's orthogonal
to those columns,",00:42:19.230,00:42:20.810
"it's orthogonal to
the column space,",00:42:20.810,00:42:22.810
the best possible answer is,00:42:22.810,00:42:24.880
zero.,00:42:24.880,00:42:25.550
"So a vector b that's orthogonal
to those columns -- let's see,",00:42:25.550,00:42:29.870
"maybe one of those minus two
of those, and one of those?",00:42:29.870,00:42:35.830
"That would be orthogonal
to those columns,",00:42:35.830,00:42:38.460
"and the best vector
would be zero, zero.",00:42:38.460,00:42:42.720
OK.,00:42:42.720,00:42:43.470
"So that's as many questions
as I can do in an hour,",00:42:43.470,00:42:46.590
"but you get three hours,
and, let me just say,",00:42:46.590,00:42:50.490
"as I've said by e-mail, thanks
very much for your patience",00:42:50.490,00:42:56.100
"as this series of
lectures was videotaped,",00:42:56.100,00:43:00.060
"and, thanks for filling
out these forms,",00:43:00.060,00:43:04.490
"maybe just leave them on the
table up there as you go out --",00:43:04.490,00:43:08.250
"and above all, thanks
for taking the course.",00:43:08.250,00:43:10.901
Thank you.,00:43:10.901,00:43:11.400
Thanks.,00:43:11.400,00:43:12.950
