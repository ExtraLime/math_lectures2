"JOHN TSISIKLIS: So here's
the agenda for today.",00:00:22.004,00:00:24.966
"We're going to do a
very quick review.",00:00:24.966,00:00:26.848
"And then we're going
to introduce some",00:00:26.848,00:00:28.936
very important concepts.,00:00:28.936,00:00:30.560
"The idea is that all
information is--",00:00:30.560,00:00:34.060
Information is always partial.,00:00:34.060,00:00:36.450
"And the question is what do we
do to probabilities if we have",00:00:36.450,00:00:40.260
"some partial information about
the random experiments.",00:00:40.260,00:00:43.340
"We're going to introduce the
important concept of",00:00:43.340,00:00:45.770
conditional probability.,00:00:45.770,00:00:47.530
"And then we will see three
very useful ways",00:00:47.530,00:00:50.860
in which it is used.,00:00:50.860,00:00:52.670
"And these ways basically
correspond to divide and",00:00:52.670,00:00:55.410
"conquer methods for breaking
up problems",00:00:55.410,00:00:58.070
into simpler pieces.,00:00:58.070,00:01:00.120
"And also one more fundamental
tool which allows us to use",00:01:00.120,00:01:04.010
"conditional probabilities to do
inference, that is, if we",00:01:04.010,00:01:07.420
"get a little bit of information
about some",00:01:07.420,00:01:09.440
"phenomenon, what can we
infer about the things",00:01:09.440,00:01:12.620
that we have not seen?,00:01:12.620,00:01:14.640
So our quick review.,00:01:14.640,00:01:17.050
"In setting up a model of a
random experiment, the first",00:01:17.050,00:01:22.100
"thing to do is to come up with
a list of all the possible",00:01:22.100,00:01:25.930
outcomes of the experiment.,00:01:25.930,00:01:27.870
"So that list is what we
call the sample space.",00:01:27.870,00:01:31.120
It's a set.,00:01:31.120,00:01:32.480
"And the elements of the
sample space are all",00:01:32.480,00:01:34.580
the possible outcomes.,00:01:34.580,00:01:35.720
Those possible outcomes must be,00:01:35.720,00:01:37.560
distinguishable from each other.,00:01:37.560,00:01:39.690
They're mutually exclusive.,00:01:39.690,00:01:41.020
"Either one happens or the other
happens, but not both.",00:01:41.020,00:01:44.900
"And they are collectively
exhaustive, that is no matter",00:01:44.900,00:01:47.440
"what the outcome of the
experiment is going to be an",00:01:47.440,00:01:50.480
element of the sample space.,00:01:50.480,00:01:52.130
"And then we discussed last
time that there's also an",00:01:52.130,00:01:54.200
"element of art in how to choose
your sample space,",00:01:54.200,00:01:57.510
"depending on how much detail
you want to capture.",00:01:57.510,00:02:01.440
This is usually the easy part.,00:02:01.440,00:02:03.130
"Then the more interesting part
is to assign probabilities to",00:02:03.130,00:02:06.980
"our model, that is to make some
statements about what we",00:02:06.980,00:02:10.660
"believe to be likely and what
we believe to be unlikely.",00:02:10.660,00:02:14.610
"The way we do that is by
assigning probabilities to",00:02:14.610,00:02:17.720
subsets of the sample space.,00:02:17.720,00:02:20.510
"So as we have our sample space
here, we may have a subset A.",00:02:20.510,00:02:26.120
"And we assign a number to that
subset P(A), which is the",00:02:26.120,00:02:31.090
"probability that this
event happens.",00:02:31.090,00:02:33.910
"Or this is the probability that
when we do the experiment",00:02:33.910,00:02:37.080
"and we get an outcome it's the
probability that the outcome",00:02:37.080,00:02:39.860
"happens to fall inside
that event.",00:02:39.860,00:02:41.850
"We have certain rules that
probabilities should satisfy.",00:02:41.850,00:02:44.500
They're non-negative.,00:02:44.500,00:02:46.210
"The probability of the overall
sample space is equal to one,",00:02:46.210,00:02:49.780
"which expresses the fact that
we're are certain, no matter",00:02:49.780,00:02:52.900
"what, the outcome is going
to be an element",00:02:52.900,00:02:55.480
of the sample space.,00:02:55.480,00:02:56.830
"Well, if we set the top right
so that it exhausts all",00:02:56.830,00:02:59.760
"possibilities, this should
be the case.",00:02:59.760,00:03:03.190
"And then there's another
interesting property of",00:03:03.190,00:03:05.480
"probabilities that says that,
if we have two events or two",00:03:05.480,00:03:09.240
"subsets that are disjoint, and
we're interested in the",00:03:09.240,00:03:11.910
"probability, that one or the
other happens, that is the",00:03:11.910,00:03:17.670
"outcome belongs to A or belongs
to B. For disjoint",00:03:17.670,00:03:21.870
"events the total probability of
these two, taken together,",00:03:21.870,00:03:25.320
"is just the sum of their
individual probabilities.",00:03:25.320,00:03:28.030
"So probabilities behave
like masses.",00:03:28.030,00:03:30.270
"The mass of the object
consisting of A and B is the",00:03:30.270,00:03:34.760
"sum of the masses of
these two objects.",00:03:34.760,00:03:37.230
"Or you can think of
probabilities as areas.",00:03:37.230,00:03:39.720
"They have, again, the
same property.",00:03:39.720,00:03:41.240
"The area of A together with B is
the area of A plus the area",00:03:41.240,00:03:45.490
B.,00:03:45.490,00:03:46.410
"But as we discussed at the end
of last lecture, it's useful",00:03:46.410,00:03:50.290
"to have in our hands a more
general version of this",00:03:50.290,00:03:53.970
"additivity property, which says
the following, if we take",00:03:53.970,00:03:58.990
a sequence of sets--,00:03:58.990,00:04:00.982
"A1, A2, A3, A4, and so on.",00:04:00.982,00:04:07.480
"And we put all of those
sets together.",00:04:07.480,00:04:09.630
It's an infinite sequence.,00:04:09.630,00:04:11.410
"And we ask for the probability
that the outcome falls",00:04:11.410,00:04:14.950
"somewhere in this infinite
union, that is we are asking",00:04:14.950,00:04:19.170
"for the probability that the
outcome belongs to one of",00:04:19.170,00:04:22.640
"these sets, and assuming that
the sets are disjoint, we can",00:04:22.640,00:04:27.950
"again find the probability for
the overall set by adding up",00:04:27.950,00:04:32.820
"the probabilities of the
individual sets.",00:04:32.820,00:04:36.000
"So this is a nice and
simple property.",00:04:36.000,00:04:38.910
"But it's a little more subtle
than you might think.",00:04:38.910,00:04:43.130
"And let's see what's going
on by considering",00:04:43.130,00:04:45.820
the following example.,00:04:45.820,00:04:47.770
"We had an example last time
where we take our sample space",00:04:47.770,00:04:51.850
to be the unit square.,00:04:51.850,00:04:53.800
"And we said let's consider a
probability law that says that",00:04:53.800,00:04:58.110
"the probability of a subset is
just the area of that subset.",00:04:58.110,00:05:04.190
"So let's consider this
probability law.",00:05:04.190,00:05:07.630
OK.,00:05:07.630,00:05:08.530
"Now the unit square is
the set --let me just",00:05:08.530,00:05:13.990
draw it this way--,00:05:13.990,00:05:15.210
"the unit square is the union of
one element set consisting",00:05:15.210,00:05:20.520
all of the points.,00:05:20.520,00:05:21.680
"So the unit square is made up
by the union of the various",00:05:21.680,00:05:28.280
points inside the square.,00:05:28.280,00:05:30.740
So union over all x's and y's.,00:05:30.740,00:05:33.830
OK?,00:05:33.830,00:05:34.770
"So the square is made
up out of all the",00:05:34.770,00:05:36.690
points that this contains.,00:05:36.690,00:05:38.400
"And now let's do
a calculation.",00:05:38.400,00:05:41.140
"One is the probability of our
overall sample space, which is",00:05:41.140,00:05:45.060
the unit square.,00:05:45.060,00:05:47.260
"Now the unit square is the union
of these things, which,",00:05:47.260,00:06:02.000
"according to our additivity
axiom, is the sum of the",00:06:02.000,00:06:06.810
"probabilities of all of these
one element sets.",00:06:06.810,00:06:10.595
"Now what is the probability
of a one element set?",00:06:16.830,00:06:20.580
"What is the probability of
this one element set?",00:06:20.580,00:06:23.520
"What's the probability that our
outcome is exactly that",00:06:23.520,00:06:26.100
particular point?,00:06:26.100,00:06:27.490
"Well, it's the area of that
set, which is zero.",00:06:27.490,00:06:31.460
So it's just the sum of zeros.,00:06:31.460,00:06:33.990
"And by any reasonable
definition the",00:06:33.990,00:06:35.950
sum of zeros is zero.,00:06:35.950,00:06:38.370
"So we just proved that
one is equal to zero.",00:06:38.370,00:06:42.220
OK.,00:06:42.220,00:06:42.680
"Either probability theory is
dead or there is some mistake",00:06:42.680,00:06:48.340
in the derivation that I did.,00:06:48.340,00:06:51.030
"OK, the mistake is quite
subtle and it",00:06:51.030,00:06:54.580
comes at this step.,00:06:54.580,00:06:57.300
"We're sort of applied the
additivity axiom by saying",00:06:57.300,00:07:00.640
"that the unit square is the
union of all those sets.",00:07:00.640,00:07:04.040
"Can we really apply our
additivity axiom.",00:07:04.040,00:07:06.500
Here's the catch.,00:07:06.500,00:07:07.260
"The additivity axiom applies
to the case where we have a",00:07:07.260,00:07:11.470
"sequence of disjoint events
and we take their union.",00:07:11.470,00:07:17.180
Is this a sequence of sets?,00:07:17.180,00:07:21.740
"Can you make up the whole unit
square by taking a sequence of",00:07:21.740,00:07:27.780
"elements inside it and cover
the whole unit square?",00:07:27.780,00:07:31.310
"Well if you try, if you start
looking at the sequence of one",00:07:31.310,00:07:34.900
"element points, that sequence
will never be able to exhaust",00:07:34.900,00:07:40.910
the whole unit square.,00:07:40.910,00:07:43.100
"So there's a deeper reason
behind that.",00:07:43.100,00:07:45.680
"And the reason is that infinite
sets are not all of",00:07:45.680,00:07:48.790
the same size.,00:07:48.790,00:07:50.130
"The integers are an
infinite set.",00:07:50.130,00:07:52.620
"And you can arrange the integers
in a sequence.",00:07:52.620,00:07:55.510
"But the continuous set
like the units",00:07:55.510,00:07:57.630
square is a bigger set.,00:07:57.630,00:08:00.205
It's so-called uncountable.,00:08:00.205,00:08:02.050
"It has more elements than
any sequence could have.",00:08:02.050,00:08:06.160
"So this union here is not of
this kind, where we would have",00:08:06.160,00:08:13.610
a sequence of events.,00:08:13.610,00:08:16.930
"It's a different
kind of union.",00:08:16.930,00:08:18.370
"It's a Union that involves a
union of many, many more sets.",00:08:18.370,00:08:23.070
"So the countable additivity
axiom does not",00:08:23.070,00:08:25.420
apply in this case.,00:08:25.420,00:08:27.360
"Because, we're not dealing
with a sequence of sets.",00:08:27.360,00:08:30.230
"And so this is the
incorrect step.",00:08:30.230,00:08:33.780
"So at some level you might think
that this is puzzling",00:08:33.780,00:08:37.240
and awfully confusing.,00:08:37.240,00:08:38.580
"On the other hand, if you think
about areas of the way",00:08:38.580,00:08:41.070
"you're used to them from
calculus, there's nothing",00:08:41.070,00:08:43.520
mysterious about it.,00:08:43.520,00:08:44.940
"Every point on the unit
square has zero area.",00:08:44.940,00:08:47.460
"When you put all the points
together, they make up",00:08:47.460,00:08:50.140
"something that has
finite area.",00:08:50.140,00:08:52.330
"So there shouldn't be any
mystery behind it.",00:08:52.330,00:08:55.470
"Now, one interesting thing that
this discussion tells us,",00:08:55.470,00:09:00.230
"especially the fact that the
single elements set has zero",00:09:00.230,00:09:03.670
"area, is the following--",00:09:03.670,00:09:05.790
"Individual points have
zero probability.",00:09:05.790,00:09:08.960
"After you do the experiment and
you observe the outcome,",00:09:08.960,00:09:12.390
"it's going to be an
individual point.",00:09:12.390,00:09:14.660
"So what happened in that
experiment is something that",00:09:14.660,00:09:18.160
"initially you thought had zero
probability of occurring.",00:09:18.160,00:09:21.820
"So if you happen to get some
particular numbers and you",00:09:21.820,00:09:25.420
"say, ""Well, in the beginning,
what did I think about those",00:09:25.420,00:09:28.290
specific numbers?,00:09:28.290,00:09:29.280
"I thought they had
zero probability.",00:09:29.280,00:09:31.290
"But yet those particular
numbers did occur.""",00:09:31.290,00:09:36.250
"So one moral from this is that
zero probability does not mean",00:09:36.250,00:09:41.640
impossible.,00:09:41.640,00:09:42.890
"It just means extremely,
extremely unlikely by itself.",00:09:42.890,00:09:46.920
"So zero probability
things do happen.",00:09:46.920,00:09:49.420
"In such continuous models,
actually zero probability",00:09:49.420,00:09:53.340
"outcomes are everything
that happens.",00:09:53.340,00:09:56.930
"And the bumper sticker version
of this is to always expect",00:09:56.930,00:10:00.790
the unexpected.,00:10:00.790,00:10:02.220
Yes?,00:10:02.220,00:10:05.095
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:10:05.095,00:10:06.345
"JOHN TSISIKLIS: Well,
probability is supposed to be",00:10:08.532,00:10:11.800
a real number.,00:10:11.800,00:10:12.530
"So it's either zero or it's
a positive number.",00:10:12.530,00:10:16.220
"So you can think of the
probability of things just",00:10:16.220,00:10:21.350
"close to that point and those
probabilities are tiny and",00:10:21.350,00:10:25.040
close to zero.,00:10:25.040,00:10:26.390
"So that's how we're going to
interpret probabilities in",00:10:26.390,00:10:28.780
continuous models.,00:10:28.780,00:10:29.810
"But this is two chapters
ahead.",00:10:29.810,00:10:31.340
Yeah?,00:10:33.950,00:10:34.230
"AUDIENCE: How do we interpret
probability of zero?",00:10:34.230,00:10:36.198
"If we can use models that
way, then how about",00:10:36.198,00:10:37.674
probability of one?,00:10:37.674,00:10:38.658
"That it it's extremely
likely but not",00:10:38.658,00:10:40.462
necessarily for certain?,00:10:40.462,00:10:42.110
"JOHN TSISIKLIS: That's
also the case.",00:10:42.110,00:10:43.320

continuous model, if you",00:10:43.320,00:10:47.450

except for one point.,00:10:55.840,00:10:57.220
"So the area of this is
going to be one.",00:10:57.220,00:11:01.150
"But this event is not entirely
certain because the zero, zero",00:11:01.150,00:11:06.330
outcome is also possible.,00:11:06.330,00:11:08.210
"So again, probability of one
means essential certainty.",00:11:08.210,00:11:12.330
"But it still allows the
possibility that the outcome",00:11:12.330,00:11:16.450
might be outside that set.,00:11:16.450,00:11:18.320
"So these are some of the weird
things that are happening when",00:11:18.320,00:11:20.910
you have continuous models.,00:11:20.910,00:11:22.680
"And that's why we start to
this class with discrete",00:11:22.680,00:11:25.240
"models, on which would
be spending the",00:11:25.240,00:11:27.050
next couple of weeks.,00:11:27.050,00:11:30.400
OK.,00:11:30.400,00:11:30.820
"So now once we have set up our
probability model and we have",00:11:30.820,00:11:35.650
"a legitimate probability law
that has these properties,",00:11:35.650,00:11:39.160
"then the rest is
usually simple.",00:11:39.160,00:11:43.070
"Somebody asks you a question of
calculating the probability",00:11:43.070,00:11:45.950
of some event.,00:11:45.950,00:11:47.520
"While you were told something
about the probability law,",00:11:47.520,00:11:50.270
"such as for example the
probabilities are equal to",00:11:50.270,00:11:52.520
"areas, and then you just
need to calculate.",00:11:52.520,00:11:55.460
"In these type of examples
somebody would give you a set",00:11:55.460,00:11:58.730
"and you would have
to calculate the",00:11:58.730,00:12:00.230
area of that set.,00:12:00.230,00:12:01.500
"So the rest is just calculation
and simple.",00:12:01.500,00:12:06.060
"Alright, so now it's time
to start with our main",00:12:06.060,00:12:09.390
business for today.,00:12:09.390,00:12:12.600
"And the starting point
is the following--",00:12:12.600,00:12:16.880
"You know something
about the world.",00:12:16.880,00:12:18.920
"And based on what you know when
you set up a probability",00:12:18.920,00:12:21.690
"model and you write down
probabilities for the",00:12:21.690,00:12:23.820
different outcomes.,00:12:23.820,00:12:26.000
"Then something happens, and
somebody tells you a little",00:12:26.000,00:12:28.950
"more about the world, gives
you some new information.",00:12:28.950,00:12:33.620
"This new information, in
general, should change your",00:12:33.620,00:12:37.430
"beliefs about what happened
or what may happen.",00:12:37.430,00:12:41.240
"So whenever we're given new
information, some partial",00:12:41.240,00:12:44.550
"information about the outcome
of the experiment, we should",00:12:44.550,00:12:47.400
revise our beliefs.,00:12:47.400,00:12:49.750
"And conditional probabilities
are just the probabilities",00:12:49.750,00:12:54.470
"that apply after the revision
of our beliefs, when we're",00:12:54.470,00:12:58.820
given some information.,00:12:58.820,00:13:00.580
"So lets make this into
a numerical example.",00:13:00.580,00:13:04.510
"So inside the sample space, this
part of the sample space,",00:13:04.510,00:13:07.870
"let's say has probability 3/6,
this part has 2/6, and that",00:13:07.870,00:13:12.580
part has 1/6.,00:13:12.580,00:13:14.550
"I guess that means that out here
we have zero probability.",00:13:14.550,00:13:17.940
"So these were our initial
beliefs about the outcome of",00:13:17.940,00:13:21.900
the experiment.,00:13:21.900,00:13:23.270
"Suppose now that someone
comes and tells you",00:13:23.270,00:13:27.160
that event B occurred.,00:13:27.160,00:13:30.960
"So they don't tell you the
full outcome with the",00:13:30.960,00:13:33.560
experiment.,00:13:33.560,00:13:34.440
"But they just tell you that the
outcome is known to lie",00:13:34.440,00:13:38.960
inside this set B.,00:13:38.960,00:13:41.060
"Well then, you should certainly
change your beliefs",00:13:41.060,00:13:44.320
in some way.,00:13:44.320,00:13:45.560
"And your new beliefs about what
is likely to occur and",00:13:45.560,00:13:48.420
"what is not is going to be
denoted by this notation.",00:13:48.420,00:13:51.770
"This is the conditional
probability that the event A",00:13:51.770,00:13:55.330
"is going to occur, the
probability that the outcome",00:13:55.330,00:13:57.970
"is going to fall inside the set
A given that we are told",00:13:57.970,00:14:01.580
"and we're sure that the event
lies inside the event B Now",00:14:01.580,00:14:05.890
"once you're told that the
outcome lies inside the event",00:14:05.890,00:14:09.000
"B, then our old sample space
in some ways is irrelevant.",00:14:09.000,00:14:13.740
"We have then you sample space,
which is just the set B. We",00:14:13.740,00:14:16.975
"are certain that the outcome
is going to be inside B.",00:14:16.975,00:14:21.020
"For example, what is this
conditional probability?",00:14:21.020,00:14:25.465
It should be one.,00:14:29.120,00:14:30.160
"Given that I told you that B
occurred, you're certain that",00:14:30.160,00:14:33.250
"B occurred, so this has
unit probability.",00:14:33.250,00:14:36.380
"So here we see an instance of
revision of our beliefs.",00:14:36.380,00:14:40.340
"Initially, event B had the
probability of (2+1)/6 --",00:14:40.340,00:14:44.880
that's 1/2.,00:14:44.880,00:14:46.300
"Initially, we thought B
had probability 1/2.",00:14:46.300,00:14:49.500
"Once we're told that B occurred,
the new probability",00:14:49.500,00:14:52.370
of B is equal to one.,00:14:52.370,00:14:54.250
OK.,00:14:54.250,00:14:55.160
"How do we revise the probability
that A occurs?",00:14:55.160,00:15:00.860
"So we are going to have the
outcome of the experiment.",00:15:00.860,00:15:03.950
"We know that it's inside B. So
we will either get something",00:15:03.950,00:15:07.330
"here, and A does not occur.",00:15:07.330,00:15:09.200
"Or something inside here,
and A does occur.",00:15:09.200,00:15:12.570
"What's the likelihood that,
given that we're inside B, the",00:15:12.570,00:15:16.280
outcome is inside here?,00:15:16.280,00:15:18.160
"Here's how we're going
to think about.",00:15:18.160,00:15:21.380
"This part of this set B, in
which A also occurs, in our",00:15:21.380,00:15:26.110
"initial model was twice as
likely as that part of B. So",00:15:26.110,00:15:31.280
"outcomes inside here
collectively were twice as",00:15:31.280,00:15:36.220
likely as outcomes out there.,00:15:36.220,00:15:38.950
"So we're going to keep the same
proportions and say, that",00:15:38.950,00:15:43.240
"given that we are inside the set
B, we still want outcomes",00:15:43.240,00:15:47.280
"inside here to be twice as
likely outcomes there.",00:15:47.280,00:15:51.120
"So the proportion of the
probabilities should be two",00:15:51.120,00:15:55.800
versus one.,00:15:55.800,00:15:57.570
"And these probabilities should
add up to one because together",00:15:57.570,00:16:01.210
"they make the conditional
probability of B. So the",00:16:01.210,00:16:04.340
"conditional probabilities should
be 2/3 probability of",00:16:04.340,00:16:09.260
"being here and 1/3 probability
of being there.",00:16:09.260,00:16:13.080
"That's how we revise
our probabilities.",00:16:13.080,00:16:16.860
"That's a reasonable, intuitively
reasonable, way of",00:16:16.860,00:16:20.740
doing this revision.,00:16:20.740,00:16:22.230
"Let's translate what we
did into a definition.",00:16:22.230,00:16:26.650
"The definition says the
following, that the",00:16:26.650,00:16:29.490
"conditional probability of A
given that B occurred is",00:16:29.490,00:16:33.410
calculated as follows.,00:16:33.410,00:16:35.270
"We look at the total probability
of B. And out of",00:16:35.270,00:16:39.430
"that probability that was inside
here, what fraction of",00:16:39.430,00:16:43.190
"that probability is assigned to
points for which the event",00:16:43.190,00:16:48.310
A also occurs?,00:16:48.310,00:16:49.780
"Does it give us the same numbers
as we got with this",00:16:54.480,00:16:56.860
heuristic argument?,00:16:56.860,00:16:58.420
"Well in this example,
probability of A intersection",00:16:58.420,00:17:01.530
"B is 2/6, divided by total
probability of B, which is",00:17:01.530,00:17:06.359
"3/6, and so it's 2/3, which
agrees with this answer that's",00:17:06.359,00:17:12.369
we got before.,00:17:12.369,00:17:13.589
"So the former indeed matches
what we were trying to do.",00:17:13.589,00:17:18.280
One little technical detail.,00:17:18.280,00:17:21.040
"If the event B has zero
probability, and then here we",00:17:21.040,00:17:24.970
"have a ratio that doesn't
make sense.",00:17:24.970,00:17:27.770
"So in this case, we say that
conditional probabilities are",00:17:27.770,00:17:30.470
not defined.,00:17:30.470,00:17:31.720
"Now you can take this definition
and unravel it and",00:17:34.780,00:17:38.980
write it in this form.,00:17:38.980,00:17:40.260
"The probability of A
intersection B is the",00:17:40.260,00:17:43.510
"probability of B times the
conditional probability.",00:17:43.510,00:17:46.780
"So this is just consequence of
the definition but it has a",00:17:50.350,00:17:53.820
nice interpretation.,00:17:53.820,00:17:55.370
"Think of probabilities
as frequencies.",00:17:55.370,00:17:57.930
"If I do the experiment over and
over, what fraction of the",00:17:57.930,00:18:01.480
"time is it going to be the case
that both A and B occur?",00:18:01.480,00:18:05.300
"Well, there's going to be a
certain fraction of the time",00:18:05.300,00:18:08.490
at which B occurs.,00:18:08.490,00:18:10.820
"And out of those times when B
occurs, there's going to be a",00:18:10.820,00:18:14.760
"further fraction of
the experiments in",00:18:14.760,00:18:17.270
which A also occurs.,00:18:17.270,00:18:19.410
"So interpret the conditional
probability as follows.",00:18:19.410,00:18:21.930
"You only look at those
experiments at which",00:18:21.930,00:18:24.320
B happens to occur.,00:18:24.320,00:18:26.050
"And look at what fraction of
those experiments where B",00:18:26.050,00:18:29.820
"already occurred, event
A also occurs.",00:18:29.820,00:18:33.670
"And there's a symmetrical
version of this equality.",00:18:33.670,00:18:39.610
"There's symmetry between the
events B and A. So you also",00:18:39.610,00:18:44.660
"have this relation that
goes the other way.",00:18:44.660,00:18:48.890
"OK, so what do we use these
conditional probabilities for?",00:18:48.890,00:18:53.950
"First, one comment.",00:18:53.950,00:18:55.120
"Conditional probabilities
are just like ordinary",00:18:55.120,00:18:58.100
probabilities.,00:18:58.100,00:18:59.170
"They're the new probabilities
that apply in a new universe",00:18:59.170,00:19:02.820
"where event B is known
to have occurred.",00:19:02.820,00:19:07.300
"So we had an original
probability model.",00:19:07.300,00:19:10.620
We are told that B occurs.,00:19:10.620,00:19:12.210
We revise our model.,00:19:12.210,00:19:13.840
"Our new model should still be
legitimate probability model.",00:19:13.840,00:19:16.690
"So it should satisfy all sorts
of properties that ordinary",00:19:16.690,00:19:20.770
probabilities do satisfy.,00:19:20.770,00:19:23.210
"So for example, if A and B are
disjoint events, then we know",00:19:23.210,00:19:29.230
"that the probability of A
union B is equal to the",00:19:29.230,00:19:33.830
"probability of A plus
probability of B. And now if I",00:19:33.830,00:19:39.230
"tell you that a certain event C
occurred, we're placed in a",00:19:39.230,00:19:42.770
"new universe where
event C occurred.",00:19:42.770,00:19:45.220
"We have new probabilities
for that universe.",00:19:45.220,00:19:47.515
"These are the conditional
probabilities.",00:19:47.515,00:19:49.880
"And conditional probabilities
also satisfy",00:19:49.880,00:19:52.960
this kind of property.,00:19:52.960,00:19:54.820
"So this is just our usual
additivity axiom but the",00:19:54.820,00:19:58.380
"applied in a new model, in which
we were told that event",00:19:58.380,00:20:02.290
C occurred.,00:20:02.290,00:20:03.250
"So conditional probabilities
do not taste or smell any",00:20:03.250,00:20:06.580
"different than ordinary
probabilities do.",00:20:06.580,00:20:09.970
"Conditional probabilities, given
a specific event B, just",00:20:09.970,00:20:14.350
"form a probability law
on our sample space.",00:20:14.350,00:20:19.480
"It's a different probability
law but it's still a",00:20:19.480,00:20:22.460
"probability law that has all
of the desired properties.",00:20:22.460,00:20:26.430
"OK, so where do conditional
probabilities come up?",00:20:26.430,00:20:30.360
"They do come up in quizzes
and they do",00:20:30.360,00:20:32.450
come up in silly problems.,00:20:32.450,00:20:34.070
So let's start with this.,00:20:34.070,00:20:35.680
"We have this example
from last time.",00:20:35.680,00:20:37.790
"Two rolls of a die, all possible
pairs of roles are",00:20:37.790,00:20:42.220
"equally likely, so every element
in this square has",00:20:42.220,00:20:46.410
probability of 1/16.,00:20:46.410,00:20:47.660
"So all elements are
equally likely.",00:20:50.300,00:20:52.330
That's our original model.,00:20:52.330,00:20:54.280
"Then somebody comes and tells us
that the minimum of the two",00:20:54.280,00:20:57.210
rolls is equal to zero.,00:20:57.210,00:20:59.530
What's that event?,00:20:59.530,00:21:02.060
"The minimum equal to zero can
happen in many ways, if we get",00:21:02.060,00:21:05.990
"two zeros or if we
get a zero and--",00:21:05.990,00:21:08.990
"sorry, if we get two
two's, or get a two",00:21:08.990,00:21:13.140
and something larger.,00:21:13.140,00:21:14.830
"And so the is our new event B.
The red event is the event B.",00:21:14.830,00:21:21.400
"And now we want to calculate
probabilities",00:21:21.400,00:21:23.500
inside this new universe.,00:21:23.500,00:21:25.310
"For example, you may be
interested in the question,",00:21:25.310,00:21:28.770
"questions about the maximum
of the two rolls.",00:21:28.770,00:21:31.960
"In the new universe, what's
the probability that the",00:21:31.960,00:21:34.310
maximum is equal to one?,00:21:34.310,00:21:37.550
"The maximum being equal to
one is this black event.",00:21:37.550,00:21:44.320
"And given that we're told that
B occurred, this black events",00:21:44.320,00:21:49.240
cannot happen.,00:21:49.240,00:21:50.300
"So this probability
is equal to zero.",00:21:50.300,00:21:53.240
"How about the maximum
being equal to two,",00:21:53.240,00:21:56.500
given that event B?,00:21:56.500,00:21:59.110
"OK, we can use the
definition here.",00:21:59.110,00:22:01.760
"It's going to be the probability
that the maximum",00:22:01.760,00:22:05.730
"is equal to two and B occurs
divided by the probability of",00:22:05.730,00:22:10.590
"B. The probability that the
maximum is equal to two.",00:22:10.590,00:22:16.020
"OK, what's the event that the
maximum is equal to two?",00:22:16.020,00:22:19.470
Let's draw it.,00:22:19.470,00:22:20.340
"This is going to be
the blue event.",00:22:20.340,00:22:22.300
"The maximum is equal to
two if we get any",00:22:22.300,00:22:25.950
of those blue points.,00:22:25.950,00:22:28.520
"So the intersection of the two
events is the intersection of",00:22:28.520,00:22:32.310
"the red event and
the blue event.",00:22:32.310,00:22:35.170
"There's only one point in
their intersection.",00:22:35.170,00:22:37.770
"So the probability of
that intersection",00:22:37.770,00:22:39.640
happening is 1/16.,00:22:39.640,00:22:41.080
That's the numerator.,00:22:43.740,00:22:45.160
How about the denominator?,00:22:45.160,00:22:47.110
"The event B consists of five
elements, each one of which",00:22:47.110,00:22:50.610
had probability of 1/16.,00:22:50.610,00:22:52.270
So that's 5/16.,00:22:52.270,00:22:54.570
And so the answer is 1/5.,00:22:54.570,00:22:58.340
"Could we have gotten this
answer in a faster way?",00:22:58.340,00:23:02.830
Yes.,00:23:02.830,00:23:04.190
Here's how it goes.,00:23:04.190,00:23:05.560
"We're trying to find the
conditional probability that",00:23:05.560,00:23:09.060
"we get this point, given
that B occurred.",00:23:09.060,00:23:13.210
B consist of five elements.,00:23:13.210,00:23:15.570
"All of those five elements were
equally likely when we",00:23:15.570,00:23:18.250
"started, so they remain equally
likely afterwards.",00:23:18.250,00:23:22.720
"Because when we define
conditional probabilities, we",00:23:22.720,00:23:25.180
"keep the same proportions
inside the set.",00:23:25.180,00:23:28.110
"So the five red elements
were equally likely.",00:23:28.110,00:23:31.940
"They remain equally likely
in the conditional world.",00:23:31.940,00:23:35.050
"So conditional event B having
happened, each one of these",00:23:35.050,00:23:39.080
"five elements has the
same probability.",00:23:39.080,00:23:41.580
"So the probability that we
actually get this point is",00:23:41.580,00:23:44.300
going to be 1/5.,00:23:44.300,00:23:46.210
And so that's the shortcut.,00:23:46.210,00:23:48.280
"More generally, whenever you
have a uniform distribution on",00:23:48.280,00:23:53.070
"your initial sample space,
when you condition on an",00:23:53.070,00:23:56.470
"event, your new distribution is
still going to be uniform,",00:23:56.470,00:24:01.000
"but on the smaller events
of that we considered.",00:24:01.000,00:24:05.010
"So we started with a uniform
distribution on the big square",00:24:05.010,00:24:09.780
"and we ended up with a
uniform distribution",00:24:09.780,00:24:13.730
just on the red point.,00:24:13.730,00:24:17.230
"Now besides silly problems,
however, conditional",00:24:17.230,00:24:19.850
"probabilities show up in real
and interesting situations.",00:24:19.850,00:24:25.070
"And this example is going
to give you some",00:24:25.070,00:24:27.390
idea of how that happens.,00:24:27.390,00:24:30.430
OK.,00:24:30.430,00:24:32.250
"Actually, in this example,
instead of starting with a",00:24:32.250,00:24:35.450
"probability model in terms of
regular probabilities, I'm",00:24:35.450,00:24:39.480
"actually going to define the
model in terms of conditional",00:24:39.480,00:24:43.070
probabilities.,00:24:43.070,00:24:43.890
"And we'll see how
this is done.",00:24:43.890,00:24:45.880
So here's the story.,00:24:45.880,00:24:48.330
"There may be an airplane flying
up in the sky, in a",00:24:48.330,00:24:52.210
"particular sector of the sky
that you're watching.",00:24:52.210,00:24:55.400
"Sometimes there is one sometimes
there isn't.",00:24:55.400,00:24:57.950
"And from experience you know
that when you look up, there's",00:24:57.950,00:25:01.760
"five percent probability that
the plane is flying above",00:25:01.760,00:25:04.400
"there and 95% probability that
there's no plane up there.",00:25:04.400,00:25:09.670
"So event A is the event that the
plane is flying out there.",00:25:09.670,00:25:14.930
"Now you bought this wonderful
radar that's looks up.",00:25:14.930,00:25:19.140
"And you're told in the
manufacturer's specs that, if",00:25:19.140,00:25:23.300
"there is a plane out there,
your radar is going to",00:25:23.300,00:25:27.310
"register something, a
blip on the screen",00:25:27.310,00:25:30.090
with probability 99%.,00:25:30.090,00:25:32.940
"And it will not register
anything with",00:25:32.940,00:25:35.540
probability one percent.,00:25:35.540,00:25:37.500
"So this particular part of the
picture is a self-contained",00:25:37.500,00:25:43.890
"probability model of what your
radar does in a world where a",00:25:43.890,00:25:50.280
plane is out there.,00:25:50.280,00:25:52.530
"So I'm telling you that the
plane is out there.",00:25:52.530,00:25:55.380
"So we're now dealing with
conditional probabilities",00:25:55.380,00:25:58.240
"because I gave you some
particular information.",00:25:58.240,00:26:00.920
"Given this information that the
plane is out there, that's",00:26:00.920,00:26:04.120
"how your radar is going to
behave with probability 99% is",00:26:04.120,00:26:07.770
"going to detect it, with
probability one percent is",00:26:07.770,00:26:10.320
going to miss it.,00:26:10.320,00:26:11.620
"So this piece of the picture
is a self-contained",00:26:11.620,00:26:14.100
probability model.,00:26:14.100,00:26:15.060
"The probabilities
add up to one.",00:26:15.060,00:26:17.130
"But it's a piece of
a larger model.",00:26:17.130,00:26:20.300
"Similarly, there's the
other possibility.",00:26:20.300,00:26:22.820
"Maybe a plane is not up there
and the manufacturer specs",00:26:22.820,00:26:27.980
"tell you something about
false alarms.",00:26:27.980,00:26:32.630
"A false alarm is the situation
where the plane is not there,",00:26:32.630,00:26:37.490
"but for some reason your radar
picked up some noise or",00:26:37.490,00:26:41.190
"whatever and shows a
blip on the screen.",00:26:41.190,00:26:43.700
"And suppose that this happens
with probability ten percent.",00:26:43.700,00:26:46.790
"Whereas with probability
90% your radar",00:26:46.790,00:26:49.170
gives the correct answer.,00:26:49.170,00:26:51.220
"So this is sort of a model of
what's going to happen with",00:26:51.220,00:26:55.430
"respect to both the plane --
we're given probabilities",00:26:55.430,00:26:59.430
"about this -- and we're given
probabilities about how the",00:26:59.430,00:27:02.000
radar behaves.,00:27:02.000,00:27:04.120
"So here I have indirectly
specified the probability law",00:27:04.120,00:27:07.740
"in our model by starting with
conditional probabilities as",00:27:07.740,00:27:10.810
"opposed to starting with
ordinary probabilities.",00:27:10.810,00:27:13.670
"Can we derive ordinary
probabilities starting from",00:27:13.670,00:27:17.160
the conditional number ones?,00:27:17.160,00:27:18.740
"Yeah, we certainly can.",00:27:18.740,00:27:20.340
"Let's look at this event, A
intersection B, which is the",00:27:20.340,00:27:25.810
"event up here, that there
is a plane and our",00:27:25.810,00:27:31.160
radar picks it up.,00:27:31.160,00:27:33.750
"How can we calculate
this probability?",00:27:33.750,00:27:35.760
"Well we use the definition of
conditional probabilities and",00:27:35.760,00:27:38.600
"this is the probability of
A times the conditional",00:27:38.600,00:27:41.430
"probability of B given A.
So it's 0.05 times 0.99.",00:27:41.430,00:27:50.260
"And the answer, in
case you care--",00:27:50.260,00:27:53.290
It's 0.0495.,00:27:53.290,00:27:56.730
OK.,00:27:56.730,00:27:57.650
"So we can calculate the
probabilities of final",00:27:57.650,00:28:01.370
"outcomes, which are the leaves
of the tree, by using the",00:28:01.370,00:28:05.120
"probabilities that
we have along the",00:28:05.120,00:28:07.250
branches of the tree.,00:28:07.250,00:28:09.000
"So essentially, what we ended
up doing was to multiply the",00:28:09.000,00:28:11.950
"probability of this
branch times the",00:28:11.950,00:28:13.700
probability of that branch.,00:28:13.700,00:28:17.220
"Now, how about the answer
to this question.",00:28:17.220,00:28:20.690
"What is the probability
that our radar is",00:28:20.690,00:28:25.350
going to register something?,00:28:25.350,00:28:28.660
"OK, this is an event that can
happen in multiple ways.",00:28:28.660,00:28:32.800
"It's the event that consists
of this outcome.",00:28:32.800,00:28:38.020
"There is a plane and the radar
registers something together",00:28:38.020,00:28:41.640
"with this outcome, there is no
plane but the radar still",00:28:41.640,00:28:46.440
registers something.,00:28:46.440,00:28:48.470
"So to find the probability of
this event, we need the",00:28:48.470,00:28:52.650
"individual probabilities
of the two outcomes.",00:28:52.650,00:28:56.940
"For the first outcome, we
already calculated it.",00:28:56.940,00:29:00.780
"For the second outcome, the
probability that this happens",00:29:00.780,00:29:03.870
"is going to be this probability
95% times 0.10,",00:29:03.870,00:29:08.480
"which is the conditional
probability for taking this",00:29:08.480,00:29:11.280
"branch, given that there
was no plane out there.",00:29:11.280,00:29:15.070
So we just add the numbers.,00:29:15.070,00:29:18.080
"0.05 times 0.99 plus 0.95
times 0.1 and the",00:29:18.080,00:29:26.950
final answer is 0.1445.,00:29:26.950,00:29:31.720
OK.,00:29:31.720,00:29:32.410
"And now here's the interesting
question.",00:29:32.410,00:29:35.730
"Given that your radar recorded
something, how likely is it",00:29:35.730,00:29:41.480
"that there is an airplane
up there?",00:29:41.480,00:29:45.070
"Your radar registering
something --",00:29:45.070,00:29:46.810
"that can be caused
by two things.",00:29:46.810,00:29:48.730
"Either there's a plane there,
and your radar did its job.",00:29:48.730,00:29:52.390
"Or there was nothing, but your
radar fired a false alarm.",00:29:52.390,00:29:57.400
"What's the probability that this
is the case as opposed to",00:29:57.400,00:30:01.690
that being the case?,00:30:01.690,00:30:05.370
OK.,00:30:05.370,00:30:06.460
"The intuitive shortcut would
be that it should be the",00:30:06.460,00:30:10.510
probability--,00:30:10.510,00:30:12.930
"you look at their relative odds
of these two elements and",00:30:12.930,00:30:15.820
"you use them to find out how
much more likely it is to be",00:30:15.820,00:30:19.570
"there as opposed
to being there.",00:30:19.570,00:30:21.730
"But instead of doing this,
let's just write down the",00:30:21.730,00:30:24.240
definition and just use it.,00:30:24.240,00:30:26.570
"It's the probability of A and
B happening, divided by the",00:30:26.570,00:30:30.480
"probability of B. This is just
our definition of conditional",00:30:30.480,00:30:34.250
probabilities.,00:30:34.250,00:30:35.540
"Now we have already found
the numerator.",00:30:35.540,00:30:39.300
"We have already calculated
the denominator.",00:30:39.300,00:30:42.450
"So we take the ratio of these
two numbers and we find the",00:30:42.450,00:30:46.440
final answer --,00:30:46.440,00:30:47.650
which is 0.34.,00:30:47.650,00:30:54.490
OK.,00:30:54.490,00:30:55.980
"There's this slightly
curious thing that's",00:30:55.980,00:30:59.040
happened in this example.,00:30:59.040,00:31:02.270
"Doesn't this number feel
a little too low?",00:31:02.270,00:31:08.380
My radar --,00:31:08.380,00:31:10.700
"So this is a conditional
probability, given that my",00:31:10.700,00:31:13.820
"radar said there is something
out there, that there is",00:31:13.820,00:31:17.110
indeed something there.,00:31:17.110,00:31:19.200
"So it's sort of the probability
that our radar",00:31:19.200,00:31:21.960
gave the correct answer.,00:31:21.960,00:31:24.560
"Now, the specs of our radar
we're pretty good.",00:31:24.560,00:31:28.580
"In this situation, it gives
you the correct",00:31:28.580,00:31:31.460
answer 99% of the time.,00:31:31.460,00:31:34.160
"In this situation, it gives
you the correct",00:31:34.160,00:31:36.020
answer 90% of the time.,00:31:36.020,00:31:38.400
"So you would think
that your radar",00:31:38.400,00:31:39.730
there is really reliable.,00:31:39.730,00:31:41.870
"But yet here the radar recorded
something, but the",00:31:41.870,00:31:47.730
"chance that the answer that
you get out of this is the",00:31:47.730,00:31:51.900
"right one, given that it
recorded something, the chance",00:31:51.900,00:31:55.180
"that there is an airplane
out there is only 30%.",00:31:55.180,00:31:58.970
"So you cannot really rely on
the measurements from your",00:31:58.970,00:32:01.980
"radar, even though the specs of
the radar were really good.",00:32:01.980,00:32:06.650
What's the reason for this?,00:32:06.650,00:32:08.620
"Well, the reason is that false
alarms are pretty common.",00:32:08.620,00:32:17.730
"Most of the time there's
nothing.",00:32:17.730,00:32:20.110
"And there's a ten percent
probability of false alarms.",00:32:20.110,00:32:23.750
"So there's roughly a ten percent
probability that in",00:32:23.750,00:32:26.640
"any given experiment, you
have a false alarm.",00:32:26.640,00:32:29.730
"And there is about the five
percent probability that",00:32:29.730,00:32:33.450
"something out there and
your radar gets it.",00:32:33.450,00:32:37.090
"So when your radar records
something, it's actually more",00:32:37.090,00:32:41.350
"likely to be a false
alarm rather than",00:32:41.350,00:32:44.980
being an actual airplane.,00:32:44.980,00:32:46.860
"This has probability ten
percent roughly.",00:32:46.860,00:32:49.100
"This has probability roughly
five percent",00:32:49.100,00:32:52.000
"So conditional probabilities
are sometimes",00:32:52.000,00:32:55.130
"counter-intuitive in terms of
the answers that they get.",00:32:55.130,00:32:58.250
"And you can make similar
stories about doctors",00:32:58.250,00:33:01.210
"interpreting the results
of tests.",00:33:01.210,00:33:04.370
"So you tested positive for
a certain disease.",00:33:04.370,00:33:07.560
"Does it mean that you have
the disease necessarily?",00:33:07.560,00:33:11.260
"Well if that disease has been
eradicated from the face of",00:33:11.260,00:33:14.590
"the earth, testing positive
doesn't mean that you have the",00:33:14.590,00:33:17.900
"disease, even if the test
was designed to be",00:33:17.900,00:33:21.740
a pretty good one.,00:33:21.740,00:33:23.320
"So unfortunately, doctors do get
it wrong also sometimes.",00:33:23.320,00:33:28.190
"And the reasoning that
comes in such",00:33:28.190,00:33:29.990
situations is pretty subtle.,00:33:29.990,00:33:32.290
"Now for the rest of the lecture,
what we're going to",00:33:32.290,00:33:34.890
"do is to take this example where
we did three things and",00:33:34.890,00:33:40.710
abstract them.,00:33:40.710,00:33:41.880
"These three trivial calculations
that's we just",00:33:41.880,00:33:44.540
"did are three very important,
very basic tools that you use",00:33:44.540,00:33:50.190
"to solve more general
probability problems.",00:33:50.190,00:33:53.350
So what's the first one?,00:33:53.350,00:33:55.040
"We find the probability of a
composite event, two things",00:33:55.040,00:33:58.040
"happening, by multiplying
probabilities and conditional",00:33:58.040,00:34:01.300
probabilities.,00:34:01.300,00:34:03.130
"More general version of this,
look at any situation, maybe",00:34:03.130,00:34:08.639
"involving lots and
lots of events.",00:34:08.639,00:34:10.860
"So here's a story that event A
may happen or may not happen.",00:34:10.860,00:34:15.510
"Given that A occurred, it's
possible that B happens or",00:34:15.510,00:34:19.440
that B does not happen.,00:34:19.440,00:34:21.360
"Given that B also happens, it's
possible that the event C",00:34:21.360,00:34:25.280
"also happens or that event
C does not happen.",00:34:25.280,00:34:29.770
"And somebody specifies for you
a model by giving you all",00:34:29.770,00:34:33.400
"these conditional probabilities
along the way.",00:34:33.400,00:34:36.230
"Notice what we move along
the branches as the tree",00:34:36.230,00:34:39.570
progresses.,00:34:39.570,00:34:40.690
"Any point in the tree
corresponds to certain events",00:34:40.690,00:34:45.110
having happened.,00:34:45.110,00:34:47.050
"And then, given that this
has happened, we specify",00:34:47.050,00:34:50.980
conditional probabilities.,00:34:50.980,00:34:52.360
"Given that this has happened,
how likely is it for that C",00:34:52.360,00:34:55.989
also occurs?,00:34:55.989,00:34:57.900
"Given a model of this kind, how
do we find the probability",00:34:57.900,00:35:00.890
or for this event?,00:35:00.890,00:35:02.660
"The answer is extremely
simple.",00:35:02.660,00:35:05.310
"All that you do is move along
with the tree and multiply",00:35:05.310,00:35:09.930
"conditional probabilities
along the way.",00:35:09.930,00:35:12.950
"So in terms of frequencies, how
often do all three things",00:35:12.950,00:35:16.900
"happen, A, B, and C?",00:35:16.900,00:35:19.310
"You first see how often
does A occur.",00:35:19.310,00:35:22.450
"Out of the times that
A occurs, how",00:35:22.450,00:35:24.860
often does B occur?,00:35:24.860,00:35:26.710
"And out of the times where both
A and B have occurred,",00:35:26.710,00:35:29.630
how often does C occur?,00:35:29.630,00:35:31.660
"And you can just multiply those
three frequencies with",00:35:31.660,00:35:34.390
each other.,00:35:34.390,00:35:36.440
"What is the formal
proof of this?",00:35:36.440,00:35:39.740
"Well, the only thing we have in
our hands is the definition",00:35:39.740,00:35:43.000
of conditional probabilities.,00:35:43.000,00:35:44.890
So let's just use this.,00:35:44.890,00:35:49.660
And--,00:35:49.660,00:35:50.910
OK.,00:35:54.370,00:35:55.000
"Now, the definition of
conditional probabilities",00:35:55.000,00:35:58.210
"tells us that the probability
of two things is the",00:35:58.210,00:36:00.770
"probability of one of them
times a conditional",00:36:00.770,00:36:03.660
probability.,00:36:03.660,00:36:04.620
"Unfortunately, here we have the",00:36:04.620,00:36:05.850
probability of three things.,00:36:05.850,00:36:07.310
What can I do?,00:36:07.310,00:36:09.000
"I can put a parenthesis in here
and think of this as the",00:36:09.000,00:36:13.570
"probability of this and that
and apply our definition of",00:36:13.570,00:36:18.640
"conditional probabilities
here.",00:36:18.640,00:36:20.300
"The probability of two things
happening is the probability",00:36:20.300,00:36:23.920
"that the first happens times
the conditional probability",00:36:23.920,00:36:28.430
"that the second happens, given
A and B, given that the first",00:36:28.430,00:36:34.070
one happened.,00:36:34.070,00:36:35.330
"So this is just the definition
of the conditional probability",00:36:35.330,00:36:38.850
"of an event, given
another event.",00:36:38.850,00:36:41.980
"That other event is a
composite one, but",00:36:41.980,00:36:44.270
that's not an issue.,00:36:44.270,00:36:45.330
It's just an event.,00:36:45.330,00:36:47.300
"And then we use the definition
of conditional probabilities",00:36:47.300,00:36:50.040
"once more to break this apart
and make it P(A), P(B given A)",00:36:50.040,00:36:56.290
"and then finally,
the last term.",00:36:56.290,00:36:58.260
OK.,00:37:00.930,00:37:01.270
"So this proves the formula
that I have up",00:37:01.270,00:37:03.680
there on the slides.,00:37:03.680,00:37:05.290
"And if you wish to calculate
any other",00:37:05.290,00:37:07.470
probability in this diagram.,00:37:07.470,00:37:09.330
"For example, if you want to
calculate this probability,",00:37:09.330,00:37:12.590
"you would still multiply the
conditional probabilities",00:37:12.590,00:37:15.580
"along the different branches
of the tree.",00:37:15.580,00:37:18.560
"In particular, here in this
branch, you would have the",00:37:18.560,00:37:22.360
"conditional probability of
C complement, given A",00:37:22.360,00:37:26.670
"intersection B complement,
and so on.",00:37:26.670,00:37:29.790
"So you write down probabilities
along all those",00:37:29.790,00:37:32.070
"tree branches and just multiply
them as you go.",00:37:32.070,00:37:35.940
"So this was the first skill
that we are covering.",00:37:38.510,00:37:44.450
What was the second one?,00:37:44.450,00:37:46.690
"What we did was to calculate
the total probability of a",00:37:46.690,00:37:53.240
"certain event B that
consisted of--",00:37:53.240,00:37:58.520
"was made up from different
possibilities, which",00:37:58.520,00:38:02.820
"corresponded to different
scenarios.",00:38:02.820,00:38:05.580
"So we wanted to calculate the
probability of this event B",00:38:05.580,00:38:08.870
"that consisted of those
two elements.",00:38:08.870,00:38:12.030
Let's generalize.,00:38:12.030,00:38:13.280
So we have our big model.,00:38:18.600,00:38:23.080
"And this sample space
is partitioned",00:38:23.080,00:38:26.110
in a number of sets.,00:38:26.110,00:38:27.410
"In our radar example, we had
a partition in two sets.",00:38:27.410,00:38:30.620
"Either a plane is there, or
a plane is not there.",00:38:30.620,00:38:33.600
"Since we're trying to
generalize, now I'm going to",00:38:33.600,00:38:35.850
"give you a picture for the case
of three possibilities or",00:38:35.850,00:38:39.410
three possible scenarios.,00:38:39.410,00:38:41.360
"So whatever happens in the
world, there are three",00:38:41.360,00:38:45.160
"possible scenarios,
A1, A2, A3.",00:38:45.160,00:38:49.660
"So think of these as there's
nothing in the air, there's an",00:38:49.660,00:38:54.695
"airplane in the air, or there's
a flock of geese",00:38:54.695,00:38:58.190
flying in the air.,00:38:58.190,00:38:59.490
"So there's three possible
scenarios.",00:38:59.490,00:39:03.050
"And then there's a certain event
B of interest, such as a",00:39:03.050,00:39:08.972
"radar records something or
doesn't record something.",00:39:08.972,00:39:12.800
We specify this model by giving,00:39:12.800,00:39:15.870
probabilities for the Ai's--,00:39:15.870,00:39:18.040
"That's the probability of
the different scenarios.",00:39:20.690,00:39:23.420
"And somebody also gives us the
probabilities that this event",00:39:23.420,00:39:27.180
"B is going to occur, given
that the Ai-th",00:39:27.180,00:39:31.010
scenario has occurred.,00:39:31.010,00:39:33.480
"Think of the Ai's
as scenarios.",00:39:33.480,00:39:36.230
"And we want to calculate the
overall probability of the",00:39:39.130,00:39:43.110
"event B. What's happening
in this example?",00:39:43.110,00:39:47.210
"Perhaps, instead of this
picture, it's easier to",00:39:47.210,00:39:49.640
"visualize if I go back to the
picture I was using before.",00:39:49.640,00:39:54.970
"We have three possible
scenarios, A1, A2, A3.",00:39:54.970,00:39:59.990
"And under each scenario, B may
happen or B may not happen.",00:39:59.990,00:40:05.150
And so on.,00:40:11.360,00:40:12.250
"So here we have A2 intersection
B. And here we",00:40:12.250,00:40:16.060
"have A3 intersection B. In the
previous slide, we found how",00:40:16.060,00:40:22.110
"to calculate the probability
of any event of this kind,",00:40:22.110,00:40:25.350
"which is done by multiplying
probabilities here and",00:40:25.350,00:40:28.870
"conditional probabilities
there.",00:40:28.870,00:40:31.100
"Now we are asked to calculate
the total probability of the",00:40:31.100,00:40:34.320
"event B. The event B can happen
in three possible ways.",00:40:34.320,00:40:38.410
It can happen here.,00:40:38.410,00:40:39.900
It can happen there.,00:40:39.900,00:40:41.700
And it can happen here.,00:40:41.700,00:40:43.780
"So this is our event B. It
consists of three elements.",00:40:43.780,00:40:50.020
"To calculate the total
probability of our event B,",00:40:50.020,00:40:53.370
"all we need to do is to add
these three probabilities.",00:40:53.370,00:40:56.730
"So B is an event that consists
of these three elements.",00:40:59.440,00:41:03.510
"There are three ways
that B can happen.",00:41:03.510,00:41:06.450
"Either B happens together with
A1, or B happens together with",00:41:06.450,00:41:10.390
"A2, or B happens together
with A3.",00:41:10.390,00:41:13.030
"So we need to add the
probabilities of these three",00:41:13.030,00:41:15.340
contingencies.,00:41:15.340,00:41:16.630
"For each one of those
contingencies, we can",00:41:16.630,00:41:18.980
"calculate its probability by
using the multiplication rule.",00:41:18.980,00:41:23.020
"So the probability of A1 and
B happening is this--",00:41:23.020,00:41:27.580
"It's the probability of A1
and then B happening",00:41:27.580,00:41:30.030
given that A1 happens.,00:41:30.030,00:41:32.020
"The probability of this
contingency is found by taking",00:41:32.020,00:41:36.140
"the probability that A2 happens
times the conditional",00:41:36.140,00:41:39.470
"probability of A2, given
that B happened.",00:41:39.470,00:41:42.350
"And similarly for
the third one.",00:41:42.350,00:41:44.640
"So this is the general rule
that we have here.",00:41:44.640,00:41:48.030
"The rule is written for the
case of three scenarios.",00:41:48.030,00:41:50.830
"But obviously, it has a
generalization for the case of",00:41:50.830,00:41:54.020
"four or five or more
scenarios.",00:41:54.020,00:41:57.440
"It gives you a way of breaking
up the calculation of an event",00:41:57.440,00:42:02.050
"that can happen in multiple ways
by considering individual",00:42:02.050,00:42:06.740
"probabilities for the different
ways that the event",00:42:06.740,00:42:09.720
can happen.,00:42:09.720,00:42:10.970
OK.,00:42:12.950,00:42:14.640
So--,00:42:14.640,00:42:16.300
Yes?,00:42:16.300,00:42:16.656
"AUDIENCE: Does this
have to change for",00:42:16.656,00:42:18.180
infinite sample space?,00:42:18.180,00:42:19.800
JOHN TSISIKLIS: No.,00:42:19.800,00:42:20.760
"This is true whether
your sample space",00:42:20.760,00:42:23.050
is infinite or finite.,00:42:23.050,00:42:25.450
"What I'm using in this argument
that we have a",00:42:25.450,00:42:28.410
"partition into just three
scenarios, three events.",00:42:28.410,00:42:33.670
"So it's a partition to a finite
number of events.",00:42:33.670,00:42:36.720
"It's also true if it's a
partition into an infinite",00:42:36.720,00:42:41.100
sequence of events.,00:42:41.100,00:42:43.670
"But that's, I think, one of the
theoretical problems at",00:42:43.670,00:42:47.550
the end of the chapter.,00:42:47.550,00:42:49.430
"You probably may not
need it for now.",00:42:49.430,00:42:54.350
"OK, going back to
the story here.",00:42:54.350,00:42:57.550
"There are three possible
scenarios about what could",00:42:57.550,00:43:00.410
"happen in the world that
are captured here.",00:43:00.410,00:43:03.390
"Event, under each scenario,
event B may or may not happen.",00:43:03.390,00:43:08.660
"And so these probabilities tell
us the likelihoods of the",00:43:08.660,00:43:11.850
different scenarios.,00:43:11.850,00:43:13.270
"These conditional probabilities
tell us how",00:43:13.270,00:43:17.640
"likely is it for B to happen
under one scenario, or the",00:43:17.640,00:43:21.030
"other scenario, or the
other scenario.",00:43:21.030,00:43:23.760
"The overall probability of
B is found by taking some",00:43:23.760,00:43:28.510
"combination of the probabilities
of B in the",00:43:28.510,00:43:32.380
"different possible
worlds, in the",00:43:32.380,00:43:34.250
different possible scenarios.,00:43:34.250,00:43:36.230
"Under some scenario, B
may be very likely.",00:43:36.230,00:43:38.690
"Under another scenario, it
may be very unlikely.",00:43:38.690,00:43:42.280
"We take all of these into
account and weigh them",00:43:42.280,00:43:45.740
"according to the likelihood
of the scenarios.",00:43:45.740,00:43:48.590
"Now notice that since A1, A2,
and three form a partition,",00:43:48.590,00:43:53.040
"these three probabilities
have what property?",00:43:53.040,00:43:58.530
Add to what?,00:43:58.530,00:44:00.810
They add to one.,00:44:00.810,00:44:03.640
"So it's the probability of this
branch, plus this branch,",00:44:03.640,00:44:06.020
plus this branch.,00:44:06.020,00:44:07.240
"So what we have here is a
weighted average of the",00:44:07.240,00:44:11.660
"probabilities of the B's into
the different worlds, or in",00:44:11.660,00:44:15.120
the different scenarios.,00:44:15.120,00:44:16.690
Special case.,00:44:16.690,00:44:17.860
"Suppose the three scenarios
are equally likely.",00:44:17.860,00:44:20.370
"So P of A1 equals 1/3, equals
to P of A2, P of A3.",00:44:20.370,00:44:25.300
what are we saying here?,00:44:25.300,00:44:27.320
"In that case of equally likely
scenarios, the probability of",00:44:27.320,00:44:31.750
"B is the average of the
probabilities of B in the",00:44:31.750,00:44:35.920
"three different words, or in the
three different scenarios.",00:44:35.920,00:44:38.835
OK.,00:44:42.950,00:44:43.450
"So to finally, the last step.",00:44:43.450,00:44:46.630
"If we go back again two slides,
the last thing that we",00:44:46.630,00:44:53.800

conditional probability of",00:44:53.800,00:44:57.510

something, how likely is it",00:45:05.630,00:45:09.840

"or not, based on the information
that we've got.",00:45:15.240,00:45:18.610
So let's generalize once more.,00:45:18.610,00:45:20.770
"And we're just going to rewrite
what we did in that",00:45:24.560,00:45:28.250
"example, but in terms of general
symbols instead of the",00:45:28.250,00:45:32.190
specific numbers.,00:45:32.190,00:45:33.650
"So once more, the model that we
have involves probabilities",00:45:33.650,00:45:38.180
of the different scenarios.,00:45:38.180,00:45:40.480
"These we call them prior
probabilities.",00:45:40.480,00:45:42.830
"They're are our initial beliefs
about how likely each",00:45:42.830,00:45:46.690
scenario is to occur.,00:45:46.690,00:45:49.360
"We also have a model of our
measuring device that tells us",00:45:49.360,00:45:54.500
"under that scenario how likely
is it that our radar will",00:45:54.500,00:45:58.110
register something or not.,00:45:58.110,00:46:00.140
"So we're given again these
conditional probabilities.",00:46:00.140,00:46:03.220
We're given the conditional,00:46:03.220,00:46:04.330
probabilities for these branches.,00:46:04.330,00:46:06.950
"Then we are told that
event B occurred.",00:46:06.950,00:46:11.050
"And on the basis of this new
information, we want to form",00:46:11.050,00:46:15.330
"some new beliefs about the
relative likelihood of the",00:46:15.330,00:46:18.510
different scenarios.,00:46:18.510,00:46:20.110
"Going back again to our radar
example, an airplane was",00:46:20.110,00:46:23.790
present with probability 5%.,00:46:23.790,00:46:26.340
"Given that the radar recorded
something, we're going to",00:46:26.340,00:46:29.180
change our beliefs.,00:46:29.180,00:46:30.540
"Now, a plane is present
with probability 34%.",00:46:30.540,00:46:34.870
"The radar, since we saw
something, we are going to",00:46:34.870,00:46:38.270
"revise our beliefs as to whether
the plane is out there",00:46:38.270,00:46:41.880
or is not there.,00:46:41.880,00:46:43.130
"And so what we need to do is to
calculate the conditional",00:46:46.040,00:46:52.660
"probabilities of the different
scenarios, given the",00:46:52.660,00:46:57.290
information that we got.,00:46:57.290,00:46:59.340
"So initially, we have these
probabilities for the",00:46:59.340,00:47:02.330
different scenarios.,00:47:02.330,00:47:04.000
"Once we get the information,
we update them and we",00:47:04.000,00:47:06.870
"calculate our revised
probabilities or conditional",00:47:06.870,00:47:09.760
"probabilities given the
observation that we made.",00:47:09.760,00:47:14.130
OK.,00:47:14.130,00:47:14.730
So what do we do?,00:47:14.730,00:47:15.760
"We just use the definition
of conditional",00:47:15.760,00:47:17.620
probabilities twice.,00:47:17.620,00:47:19.360
"By definition the conditional
probability is the probability",00:47:19.360,00:47:22.490
"of two things happening divided
by the probability of",00:47:22.490,00:47:25.740
the conditioning event.,00:47:25.740,00:47:27.960
"Now, I'm using the definition
of conditional probabilities",00:47:27.960,00:47:30.480
"once more, or rather I use
the multiplication rule.",00:47:30.480,00:47:33.550
"The probability of two things
happening is the probability",00:47:33.550,00:47:35.970
of the first and the second.,00:47:35.970,00:47:38.740
"So these are things that
are given to us.",00:47:38.740,00:47:41.190
"They're the probabilities of
the different scenarios.",00:47:41.190,00:47:43.430
"And it's the model of our
measuring device, which we",00:47:43.430,00:47:47.750
assume to be available.,00:47:47.750,00:47:51.810
And how about the denominator?,00:47:51.810,00:47:53.450
"This is total probability of the
event B. But we just found",00:47:53.450,00:47:57.780
"that's it's easy to calculate
using the formula in the",00:47:57.780,00:48:01.140
previous slide.,00:48:01.140,00:48:02.400
"To find the overall probability
of event B",00:48:02.400,00:48:04.750
"occurring, we look at the
probabilities of B occurring",00:48:04.750,00:48:08.260
"under the different scenario
and weigh them according to",00:48:08.260,00:48:11.560
"the probabilities of
all the scenarios.",00:48:11.560,00:48:13.710
"So in the end, we have a formula
for the conditional",00:48:13.710,00:48:17.370
"probability, A's given B,
based on the data of the",00:48:17.370,00:48:22.730
"problem, which were
probabilities of the different",00:48:22.730,00:48:25.090
"scenarios and conditional
probabilities of",00:48:25.090,00:48:27.360
"B, given the A's.",00:48:27.360,00:48:29.490
"So what this calculation does
is, basically, it reverses the",00:48:29.490,00:48:33.320
order of conditioning.,00:48:33.320,00:48:35.310
"We are given conditional
probabilities of these kind,",00:48:35.310,00:48:39.000
"where it's B given A and we
produce new conditional",00:48:39.000,00:48:42.950
"probabilities, where things
go the other way.",00:48:42.950,00:48:46.630
"So schematically, what's
happening here is that we have",00:48:46.630,00:48:53.530
"model of cause and
effect and--",00:48:53.530,00:48:59.995
"So a scenario occurs and that
may cause B to happen or may",00:49:02.550,00:49:09.840
not cause it to happen.,00:49:09.840,00:49:11.880
"So this is a cause/effect
model.",00:49:11.880,00:49:14.495
"And it's modeled using
probabilities, such as",00:49:17.300,00:49:20.090
probability of B given Ai.,00:49:20.090,00:49:23.350
"And what we want to do is
inference where we are told",00:49:23.350,00:49:28.710
"that B occurs, and we want
to infer whether Ai",00:49:28.710,00:49:35.910
also occurred or not.,00:49:35.910,00:49:38.580
"And the appropriate
probabilities for that are the",00:49:38.580,00:49:42.050
"conditional probabilities
that A occurred,",00:49:42.050,00:49:45.010
given that B occurred.,00:49:45.010,00:49:48.110
"So we're starting with a causal
model of our situation.",00:49:48.110,00:49:52.250
"It models from a given cause how
likely is a certain effect",00:49:52.250,00:49:57.220
to be observed.,00:49:57.220,00:49:58.830
"And then we do inference, which
answers the question,",00:49:58.830,00:50:02.920
"given that the effect was
observed, how likely is it",00:50:02.920,00:50:06.730
"that the world was in this
particular situation or state",00:50:06.730,00:50:10.870
or scenario.,00:50:10.870,00:50:12.940
"So the name of the Bayes rule
comes from Thomas Bayes, a",00:50:12.940,00:50:17.260
"British theologian back
in the 1700s.",00:50:17.260,00:50:20.750
It actually--,00:50:20.750,00:50:21.530
"This calculation addresses
a basic problem, a basic",00:50:21.530,00:50:25.000
"philosophical problem, how one
can learn from experience or",00:50:25.000,00:50:30.230
"from experimental data and
some systematic way.",00:50:30.230,00:50:33.300
"So the British at that time
were preoccupied with this",00:50:33.300,00:50:35.840
type of question.,00:50:35.840,00:50:36.710
"Is there a basic theory that
about how we can incorporate",00:50:36.710,00:50:41.200
"new knowledge to previous
knowledge.",00:50:41.200,00:50:44.280
"And this calculation made an
argument that, yes, it is",00:50:44.280,00:50:47.600
"possible to do that in
a systematic way.",00:50:47.600,00:50:50.100
"So the philosophical
underpinnings of this have a",00:50:50.100,00:50:53.040
"very long history and a lot
of discussion around them.",00:50:53.040,00:50:57.050
"But for our purposes, it's just
an extremely useful tool.",00:50:57.050,00:51:00.560
"And it's the foundation of
almost everything that gets",00:51:00.560,00:51:03.550
"done when you try to do
inference based on partial",00:51:03.550,00:51:07.190
observations.,00:51:07.190,00:51:08.860
Very well.,00:51:08.860,00:51:09.690
Till next time.,00:51:09.690,00:51:10.940
