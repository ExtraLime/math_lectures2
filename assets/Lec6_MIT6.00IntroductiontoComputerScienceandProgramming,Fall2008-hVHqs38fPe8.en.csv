"PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG:
All right.",00:00:19.980,00:00:23.600
"That said, let's continue, and
if you remember last time, we",00:00:23.600,00:00:30.720
"ended up looking at this thing
I called square roots bi.",00:00:30.720,00:00:35.180
"This was using something called
a bisection method,",00:00:35.180,00:00:38.810
"which is related to something
called binary search, which",00:00:38.810,00:00:42.230
"we'll see lots more of later,
to find square roots.",00:00:42.230,00:00:47.270
"And the basic idea was that we
had some sort of a line, and",00:00:47.270,00:00:53.260
"we knew the answer was somewhere
between this point",00:00:53.260,00:00:57.010
and this point.,00:00:57.010,00:01:00.810
The line is totally ordered.,00:01:00.810,00:01:10.800
"And what that means, is that
anything here is smaller than",00:01:10.800,00:01:16.980
anything to its right.,00:01:16.980,00:01:19.680
"So the integers are totally
ordered, the reals are totally",00:01:19.680,00:01:23.000
"ordered, lots of
things are, the",00:01:23.000,00:01:25.250
rationals are totally ordered.,00:01:25.250,00:01:28.290
"And that idea was, we make a
guess in the middle, we test",00:01:28.290,00:01:32.620
"it so this is kind of a guess
and check, and if the answer",00:01:32.620,00:01:37.360
"was too big, then we knew
that we should be",00:01:37.360,00:01:41.410
looking over here.,00:01:41.410,00:01:43.220
"If it was too small, we knew
we should be looking over",00:01:43.220,00:01:45.470
"here, and then we
would repeat.",00:01:45.470,00:01:50.140
"So this is very similar, this
is a kind of recursive",00:01:50.140,00:01:53.340
"thinking we talked about
earlier, where we take our",00:01:53.340,00:01:56.590
"problem and we make it smaller,
we solve a smaller",00:01:56.590,00:01:59.390
"problem, et cetera.",00:01:59.390,00:02:02.900
All right.,00:02:02.900,00:02:03.630
"So now, we've got it, I've
got the code up for you.",00:02:03.630,00:02:10.160
"I want you to notice the
specifications to start.",00:02:10.160,00:02:13.910
"We're assuming that x is greater
than or equal to 0,",00:02:13.910,00:02:17.840
"and epsilon is strictly greater
than 0, and we're",00:02:17.840,00:02:21.400
"going to return some value y
such that y squared is within",00:02:21.400,00:02:26.120
epsilon of x.,00:02:26.120,00:02:29.820
"I'd last time talked about the
two assert statements.",00:02:29.820,00:02:34.110
"In some sense, strictly speaking
they shouldn't be",00:02:34.110,00:02:36.750
"necessary, because the fact that
my specification starts",00:02:36.750,00:02:42.510
"with an assumption, says, hey
you, who might call square",00:02:42.510,00:02:46.740
"root, make sure that the things
you call me with obey",00:02:46.740,00:02:51.590
the assumption.,00:02:51.590,00:02:53.140
"On the other hand, as I said,
never trust a programmer to do",00:02:53.140,00:02:56.670
"the right thing, so we're
going to check it.",00:02:56.670,00:03:00.200
"And just in case the assumptions
are not true,",00:03:00.200,00:03:02.580
"we're just going to stop
dead in our tracks.",00:03:02.580,00:03:04.740
All right.,00:03:04.740,00:03:08.190
"Then we're going to set low to--
low and high, and we're",00:03:08.190,00:03:12.390
"going to perform exactly the
process I talked about.",00:03:12.390,00:03:18.160
"And along the way, I'm keeping
track of how many iterations,",00:03:18.160,00:03:23.060
"at the end I'll print how many
iterations I took, before I",00:03:23.060,00:03:26.960
return the final guess.,00:03:26.960,00:03:28.970
"All right, let's test it.",00:03:28.970,00:03:32.410
"So one of the things I want you
to observe here, is that",00:03:32.410,00:03:35.910
"instead of sitting there and
typing away a bunch of test",00:03:35.910,00:03:38.550
"cases, I took the trouble to
write a function, called test",00:03:38.550,00:03:43.510
bi in this case.,00:03:43.510,00:03:44.500
"All right, so what that's doing,
is it's taking the",00:03:44.500,00:03:49.680
"things I would normally type,
and putting them in a",00:03:49.680,00:03:55.000
"function, which I
can then call.",00:03:55.000,00:03:57.500
"Why is that better
than typing them?",00:03:57.500,00:04:05.450
"Why was it worth creating
a function to do this?",00:04:05.450,00:04:10.740
Pardon?,00:04:10.740,00:04:11.080

can I can use it again and",00:04:13.690,00:04:17.480
again and again.,00:04:17.480,00:04:19.630
Exactly.,00:04:19.630,00:04:24.300
"By putting it in a function, if
I find a bug and I change",00:04:24.300,00:04:28.390
"my program, I can just run
the function again.",00:04:28.390,00:04:33.380
"The beauty of this is, it keeps
me from getting lazy,",00:04:33.380,00:04:40.010
"and not only testing my program
and the thing that",00:04:40.010,00:04:43.040
"found the bug, but in all the
things that used to work.",00:04:43.040,00:04:47.260
"We'll talk more about this
later, but it often happens",00:04:47.260,00:04:51.090
"that when you change your
program to solve one problem,",00:04:51.090,00:04:54.290
"you break it, and things that
used to work don't work.",00:04:54.290,00:04:58.080
"And so what you want to do, and
again we'll come back to",00:04:58.080,00:05:00.970
"this later in the term,
is something",00:05:00.970,00:05:03.360
called regression testing.,00:05:03.360,00:05:08.170
"This has nothing to do with
linear regression.",00:05:08.170,00:05:13.650
"And that's basically trying to
make sure our program has not",00:05:13.650,00:05:16.590
"regressed, as to say,
gone backwards",00:05:16.590,00:05:19.720
in how well it works.,00:05:19.720,00:05:21.480
"And so we always test
it on everything.",00:05:21.480,00:05:24.900
All right?,00:05:24.900,00:05:25.630
"So I've created this function,
let's give it a shot and see",00:05:25.630,00:05:28.920
what happens.,00:05:28.920,00:05:37.990
We'll run test bi.,00:05:37.990,00:05:40.530
Whoops!,00:05:40.530,00:05:42.600
"All right, well let's
look at our answers.",00:05:42.600,00:05:46.230
"I first tested it on the square
root of 4, and in one",00:05:46.230,00:05:51.790
iteration it found 2.,00:05:51.790,00:05:53.890
I like that answer.,00:05:53.890,00:05:56.030
"I then tested it on the square
root of 9, and as I mentioned",00:05:56.030,00:05:59.680
"last time, I didn't find 3.",00:05:59.680,00:06:03.510
I was not crushed.,00:06:03.510,00:06:05.080
"You know, I was not really
disappointed, it found",00:06:05.080,00:06:08.110
"something close enough
to 3 that I'm happy.",00:06:08.110,00:06:13.040
All right.,00:06:13.040,00:06:13.690
"I tried it on 2, I surely didn't
expect a precise and",00:06:13.690,00:06:18.260
"exact answer to that, but I
got something, and if you",00:06:18.260,00:06:22.470
"square this, you'll find
the answer kept pretty",00:06:22.470,00:06:24.710
darn close to 2.,00:06:24.710,00:06:27.780
"I then tried it on
0.25 One quarter.",00:06:27.780,00:06:34.250
"And what happened was
not what I wanted.",00:06:34.250,00:06:39.990
"As you'll see, it crashed.",00:06:39.990,00:06:44.230
"It didn't really crash, it found
an assert statement.",00:06:44.230,00:06:50.460
"So if you look at the bottom
of the function, you'll see",00:06:50.460,00:06:53.770
"that, in fact, I checked
for that.",00:06:53.770,00:07:04.280
"I assert the counter is less
than or equal to 0.",00:07:04.280,00:07:08.220
"I'm checking that I didn't leave
my program because I",00:07:08.220,00:07:11.130
didn't find an answer.,00:07:11.130,00:07:14.460
"Well, this is a good thing, it's
better than my program",00:07:14.460,00:07:16.570
"running forever, but it's a bad
thing because I don't have",00:07:16.570,00:07:21.210
it the square root of 0.25.,00:07:21.210,00:07:25.500
What went wrong here?,00:07:25.500,00:07:31.640
"Well, let's think about
it for a second.",00:07:31.640,00:07:33.450
"You look like-- someone
looks like they're",00:07:33.450,00:07:34.890
dying to give an answer.,00:07:34.890,00:07:36.060
"No, you just scratching
your head?",00:07:36.060,00:07:37.990
All right.,00:07:37.990,00:07:39.380
"Remember, I said when we do
a bisection method, we're",00:07:39.380,00:07:44.070
"assuming the answer lies
somewhere between the lower",00:07:44.070,00:07:46.890
bound and the upper bound.,00:07:46.890,00:07:51.180
"Well, what is the square
root of a quarter?",00:07:51.180,00:07:56.560
It is a half.,00:07:56.560,00:08:01.560
"Well, what-- where did
I tell my program",00:08:01.560,00:08:06.130
to look for an answer?,00:08:06.130,00:08:08.060
Between 0 and x.,00:08:08.060,00:08:14.210
"So the problem was, the answer
was over here somewhere, and",00:08:14.210,00:08:22.080
"so I'm never going to find it
cleverly searching in this",00:08:22.080,00:08:25.940
"region, right?",00:08:25.940,00:08:28.960
"So the basic idea was fine, but
I failed to satisfy the",00:08:28.960,00:08:34.120
"initial condition that the
answer had to be between the",00:08:34.120,00:08:37.750
"lower bound and the
upper bound.",00:08:37.750,00:08:40.980
Right?,00:08:40.980,00:08:44.140
And why did I do that?,00:08:44.140,00:08:45.510
"Because I forgot what happens
when you look at fractions.",00:08:45.510,00:08:52.900
So what should I do?,00:08:52.900,00:08:56.630
"Actually I lied, by the way,
when I said the answer was",00:08:56.630,00:08:58.930
over there.,00:08:58.930,00:08:59.830
Where was the answer?,00:08:59.830,00:09:02.450
Somebody?,00:09:02.450,00:09:05.360
It was over here.,00:09:05.360,00:09:10.860
"Because the square root of a
quarter is not smaller than a",00:09:10.860,00:09:15.920
"quarter, it's bigger
than a quarter.",00:09:15.920,00:09:18.430
Right?,00:09:18.430,00:09:18.750
"A half is strictly greater
than a quarter.",00:09:18.750,00:09:27.930
So it wasn't on the region.,00:09:27.930,00:09:29.730
So how-- what's the fix?,00:09:29.730,00:09:31.170
"Should be a pretty simple fix,
in fact we should be able to",00:09:31.170,00:09:33.410
"do it on the fly, here.",00:09:33.410,00:09:35.130
What should I change?,00:09:35.130,00:09:40.550
"Do I need to change
the lower bound?",00:09:40.550,00:09:42.700
"Is the square root ever going
to be less than 0?",00:09:42.700,00:09:45.860
"Doesn't need to be, so, what
should I do about the upper",00:09:45.860,00:09:49.580
bound here?,00:09:49.580,00:09:52.580
"Oh, I could cheat and make, OK,
the upper bound a half,",00:09:52.580,00:09:56.060
"but that wouldn't
be very honest.",00:09:56.060,00:09:58.970
"What would be a good
thing to do here?",00:09:58.970,00:10:05.490
Pardon?,00:10:05.490,00:10:08.350
"I could square x, but maybe
I should just do something",00:10:08.350,00:10:13.030
pretty simple here.,00:10:13.030,00:10:16.170
Suppose-- whoops.,00:10:16.170,00:10:19.000
"Suppose I make it the
max of x and 1.",00:10:19.000,00:10:35.620
"Then if I'm looking for the
square root of something less",00:10:35.620,00:10:38.220
"than 1, I know it will be
in my region, right?",00:10:38.220,00:10:44.660
"All right, let's save
this, and run it",00:10:44.660,00:10:47.370
and see what happens.,00:10:47.370,00:11:04.370
"Sure enough, it worked and, did
we get-- we got the right",00:11:04.370,00:11:08.840
"answer, 0.5 All right?",00:11:08.840,00:11:16.220
"And by the way, I checked
all of my previous ones,",00:11:16.220,00:11:19.830
and they work too.,00:11:19.830,00:11:25.160
All right.,00:11:25.160,00:11:25.630
"Any questions about
bisection search?",00:11:25.630,00:11:33.240
"One of the things I want you to
notice here is the number",00:11:33.240,00:11:37.710
"iterations is certainly
not constant.",00:11:37.710,00:11:42.350
"Yeah, when I will looked at 4,
it was a nice number like 1, 9",00:11:42.350,00:11:46.600
"looked like it took me 18, 2
took me 14, if we try some big",00:11:46.600,00:11:54.250
"numbers it might take
even longer.",00:11:54.250,00:12:00.240
"These numbers are small, but
sometimes when we look at",00:12:00.240,00:12:03.650
"really harder problems, we got
ourselves in a position where",00:12:03.650,00:12:08.900
"we do care about the number of
iterations, and we care about",00:12:08.900,00:12:12.920
"something called the speed
of convergence.",00:12:12.920,00:12:23.450
"Bisection methods were known to
the ancient Greeks, and it",00:12:23.450,00:12:27.790
"is believed by many, even
to the Babylonians.",00:12:27.790,00:12:32.740
"And as I mentioned last time,
this was the state of the art",00:12:32.740,00:12:37.320
until the 17th century.,00:12:37.320,00:12:41.560
"At which point, things
got better.",00:12:41.560,00:12:45.530
"So, let's think about it, and
let's think about what we're",00:12:45.530,00:12:51.680
"actually doing when
we solve this.",00:12:51.680,00:12:54.160
"When we look for something like
the square root of x,",00:12:54.160,00:12:59.910
"what we're really doing,
is solving an equation.",00:12:59.910,00:13:06.690
"We're looking at the equation
f of guess equals the guess",00:13:06.690,00:13:19.480
squared minus x.,00:13:19.480,00:13:26.430
"Right, that's what that is equal
to, and we're trying to",00:13:26.430,00:13:29.890
"solve the equation that
f of guess equals 0.",00:13:29.890,00:13:39.600
"Looking for the root
of this equation.",00:13:39.600,00:13:45.320
"So if we looked at it
pictorially, what we've got",00:13:45.320,00:13:54.870
"here is, we're looking at f of
x, I've plotted it here, and",00:13:54.870,00:14:02.830
"we're asking where it
crosses the x axis.",00:14:02.830,00:14:08.850
"Sorry for the overloading
of the word x.",00:14:08.850,00:14:12.610
And I'm looking here at 16.,00:14:12.610,00:14:15.120
"Square root of 16, and my plot
basically shows it crosses at",00:14:15.120,00:14:20.290
"4 and-- well, I think
that's minus 4.",00:14:20.290,00:14:23.120
"The perspective is tricky--
and so we're",00:14:23.120,00:14:28.650
trying to find the roots.,00:14:28.650,00:14:32.120
"Now Isaac Newton and/or Joseph
Raphson figured out how to do",00:14:32.120,00:14:37.630
"this kind of thing for all
differentiable functions.",00:14:37.630,00:14:41.530
"Don't worry about
what that means.",00:14:41.530,00:14:43.740
"The basic idea is, you take a
guess, and you -- whoops --",00:14:43.740,00:14:50.130
"and you find the tangent
of that guess.",00:14:50.130,00:14:56.540
So let's say I guessed 3.,00:14:56.540,00:14:59.040
"I look for the tangent
of the curve at 3.",00:14:59.040,00:15:04.290
"All right, so I've got the
tangent, and then my next",00:15:04.290,00:15:07.700
"guess is going to be where the
tangent crosses the x axis.",00:15:07.700,00:15:14.680
"So instead of dividing it in
half, I'm using a different",00:15:14.680,00:15:18.780
method to find the next guess.,00:15:18.780,00:15:24.800
"The utility of this relies upon
the observation that,",00:15:24.800,00:15:29.690
"most of the time-- and I want to
emphasize this, most of the",00:15:29.690,00:15:34.050
"time, that implies not all of
the time-- the tangent line is",00:15:34.050,00:15:40.830
"a good approximation
to the curve for",00:15:40.830,00:15:44.970
values near the solution.,00:15:44.970,00:15:51.240
"And therefore, the x intercept
of the tangent will be closer",00:15:51.240,00:15:56.820
"to the right answer than
the current guess.",00:15:56.820,00:16:01.020
"Is that always true,
by the way?",00:16:01.020,00:16:04.520
"Show me a place where that's
not true, where the tangent",00:16:04.520,00:16:07.820
line will be really bad.,00:16:07.820,00:16:12.370
Yeah.,00:16:12.370,00:16:13.060
"Suppose I choose it right
down there, I guess 0.",00:16:13.060,00:16:17.050
"Well, the tangent there will not
even have an x intercept.",00:16:17.050,00:16:21.550
"So I'm really going to
be dead in the water.",00:16:21.550,00:16:24.920
"This is the sort of thing that
people who do numerical",00:16:24.920,00:16:27.440
"programming worry about
all the time.",00:16:27.440,00:16:30.660
"And there are a lot of a little
tricks they use to deal",00:16:30.660,00:16:32.810
"with that, they'll perturb
it a little",00:16:32.810,00:16:34.240
"bit, things like that.",00:16:34.240,00:16:36.380
"You should not, at
this point, be",00:16:36.380,00:16:37.910
worrying about those things.,00:16:37.910,00:16:41.590
"This method, interestingly
enough, is actually the method",00:16:41.590,00:16:45.230
used in most hand calculators.,00:16:45.230,00:16:48.350
"So if you've got a calculator
that has a square root button,",00:16:48.350,00:16:52.110
it's actually in the calculator,00:16:52.110,00:16:53.890
running Newton's method.,00:16:53.890,00:16:56.140
"Now I know you thought it was
going to do that thing you",00:16:56.140,00:16:58.050
"learned in high school for
finding square roots, which I",00:16:58.050,00:17:01.090
"never could quite understand,
but no.",00:17:01.090,00:17:03.860
"It uses Newton's method
to do it.",00:17:03.860,00:17:07.840
"So how do we find the intercept
of the tangent, the",00:17:07.840,00:17:11.280
x intercept?,00:17:11.280,00:17:13.480
"Well this is where derivatives
come in.",00:17:13.480,00:17:17.940
"What we know is that the slope
of the tangent is given by the",00:17:17.940,00:17:27.440
"first derivative of the
function f at the",00:17:27.440,00:17:30.200
point of the guess.,00:17:30.200,00:17:31.940
"So the slope of the guess
is the first derivative.",00:17:31.940,00:17:36.090
Right.,00:17:36.090,00:17:36.570
Which dy over dx.,00:17:36.570,00:17:41.780
"Change in y divided
by change in x.",00:17:41.780,00:17:45.560
"So we can use some algebra,
which I won't go through here,",00:17:45.560,00:17:50.910
"and what we would find is that
for square root, the",00:17:50.910,00:17:54.980
"derivative, written f prime of
the i'th guess is equal to two",00:17:54.980,00:18:05.630
times the i'th guess.,00:18:05.630,00:18:07.970
"Well, should have left myself
a little more room, sorry",00:18:07.970,00:18:10.380
about that.,00:18:10.380,00:18:15.570
All right?,00:18:15.570,00:18:18.050
You could work this out.,00:18:18.050,00:18:20.190
Right?,00:18:20.190,00:18:20.950
"The derivative of the
square root is not",00:18:20.950,00:18:22.830
a complicated thing.,00:18:22.830,00:18:26.570
"Therefore, and here's the key
thing we need to keep in mind,",00:18:26.570,00:18:35.090
"we'll know that we can choose
guess i plus 1 to be equal to",00:18:35.090,00:18:46.390
"the old guess, guess i, minus
whatever the value is of the",00:18:46.390,00:18:53.900
"new guess-- of the old rather,
the old guess-- divided by",00:18:53.900,00:19:03.060
twice the old guess.,00:19:03.060,00:19:14.800
"All right, again this is
straightforward kind of",00:19:14.800,00:19:17.870
"algebraic manipulations
to get here.",00:19:17.870,00:19:20.400
So let's look at an example.,00:19:20.400,00:19:22.590
"Suppose we start looking for
the square root of 16",00:19:22.590,00:19:25.810
with the guess 3.,00:19:25.810,00:19:30.650
"What's the value of the
function f of 3?",00:19:30.650,00:19:37.660
"Well, it's going to be, we
looked at our function there,",00:19:37.660,00:19:41.450
"guess squared, 3 times 3 is 9 I
think, minus 16, that's what",00:19:41.450,00:19:54.090
"x is in this case, which
equals minus 7.",00:19:54.090,00:20:02.310
"That being the case, what's
my next guess?",00:20:02.310,00:20:13.310
"Well I start with my old guess,
3, minus f of my old",00:20:13.310,00:20:22.530
"guess, which is minus 7, divided
by twice my old guess,",00:20:22.530,00:20:33.770
"which is 6, minus the minus,
and I get as my new guess",00:20:33.770,00:20:42.550
4.1666 or thereabouts.,00:20:42.550,00:20:51.250
"So you can see I've missed,
but I am closer.",00:20:51.250,00:20:57.590
"And then I would reiterate this
process using that as",00:20:57.590,00:21:03.700
"guess i, and do it again.",00:21:03.700,00:21:08.460
"One way to think about this
intuitively, if the derivative",00:21:08.460,00:21:12.960
"is very large, the function
is changing quickly, and",00:21:12.960,00:21:19.010
"therefore we want to
take small steps.",00:21:19.010,00:21:21.080
All right.,00:21:21.080,00:21:23.520
"If the derivative is small, it's
not changing, maybe want",00:21:23.520,00:21:28.960
"to take a larger step,
but let's not worry",00:21:28.960,00:21:31.630
"about that, all right?",00:21:31.630,00:21:34.100
"Does this method work
all the time?",00:21:34.100,00:21:37.310
"Well, we already saw no, if my
initial guess is zero, I don't",00:21:37.310,00:21:42.880
get anywhere.,00:21:42.880,00:21:44.210
"In fact, my program crashes
because I end up trying to",00:21:44.210,00:21:46.260
"divide by zero, a really
bad thing.",00:21:46.260,00:21:49.730
"Hint: if you implement Newton's
method, do not make",00:21:49.730,00:21:53.620
your first guess zero.,00:21:53.620,00:21:57.030
"All right, so let's look
at the code for that.",00:21:57.030,00:22:08.220
"All right so-- yeah, how do I
get to the code for that?",00:22:08.220,00:22:13.310
That's interesting.,00:22:13.310,00:22:25.400
All right.,00:22:25.400,00:22:30.140
"So we have that square
root NR.",00:22:30.140,00:22:32.110
NR for Newton Raphson.,00:22:32.110,00:22:36.620
"First thing I want you to
observe is its specification",00:22:36.620,00:22:40.840
"is identical to the
specification",00:22:40.840,00:22:43.500
of square root bi.,00:22:43.500,00:22:48.420
"What that's telling me is that
if you're a user of this, you",00:22:48.420,00:22:54.170
"don't care how it's
implemented, you",00:22:54.170,00:22:56.290
care what it does.,00:22:56.290,00:23:00.350
"And therefore, it's fine that
the specifications are",00:23:00.350,00:23:03.600
"identical, in fact it's a good
thing, so that means if",00:23:03.600,00:23:06.820
"someday Professor Grimson
invents something that's",00:23:06.820,00:23:09.330
"better than Newton Raphson, we
can all re-implement our",00:23:09.330,00:23:12.610
"square root functions and none
of the programs that use it",00:23:12.610,00:23:16.030
"will have to change,
as long as the",00:23:16.030,00:23:18.270
specification is the same.,00:23:18.270,00:23:24.000
"All right, so, not much
to see about this.",00:23:24.000,00:23:28.150
"As I said, the specifications is
the same, same assertions,",00:23:28.150,00:23:33.140
"and the-- it's basically the
same program as the one we",00:23:33.140,00:23:35.840
"were just looking at, but I'm
starting with a different",00:23:35.840,00:23:43.560
"guess, in this case x over 2,
well I'm going to, couple of",00:23:43.560,00:23:48.400
"different guesses we can start
with, we can experiment with",00:23:48.400,00:23:52.440
"different guesses and see
whether we get the same",00:23:52.440,00:23:54.350
"answer, and in fact, if we did,
we would see we didn't",00:23:54.350,00:23:57.920
"get this, we got different
answers, but correct answers.",00:23:57.920,00:24:02.590
"Actually now, we'll just
comment that out.",00:24:02.590,00:24:09.710
"I'm going to compute the
difference, just as I did on",00:24:09.710,00:24:13.130
"the board, and off we'll go.",00:24:13.130,00:24:17.440
All right.,00:24:17.440,00:24:18.360
"Now, let's try and compare
these things.",00:24:18.360,00:24:23.200
"And what we're going to look at
is another procedure, you",00:24:23.200,00:24:30.890
"have the code for these things
on your handout so we won't",00:24:30.890,00:24:33.610
"worry, don't need to show you
the code, but let's look at",00:24:33.610,00:24:38.190
how we're going to test it.,00:24:38.190,00:24:40.670
"I'm doing a little trick by the
way, I'm using raw input",00:24:40.670,00:24:45.260
"in my function here, as a just
a way to stop the display.",00:24:45.260,00:24:49.930
"This way I can torture
you between tests",00:24:49.930,00:24:52.790
by asking you questions.,00:24:52.790,00:24:54.550
Making it stop.,00:24:54.550,00:24:57.240
"All right, so, we'll
try some things.",00:24:57.240,00:24:59.870
We'll see what it does.,00:24:59.870,00:25:06.240
"Starting with that, well, let's
look at some of the",00:25:06.240,00:25:09.910
things it will do.,00:25:09.910,00:25:12.590
"Yeah, I'll save it..",00:25:12.590,00:25:23.050
"It's a little bit annoying, but
it makes the font bigger.",00:25:23.050,00:25:34.560
"All right, so we've tested it,
and we haven't tested it yet,",00:25:34.560,00:25:39.580
"we have tested it but, we
haven't seen it, well, you",00:25:39.580,00:25:46.650
know what I'm going to do?,00:25:46.650,00:25:47.310
I'm going to tort--,00:25:47.310,00:25:48.020
"I'm going to make the font
smaller so we can see more.",00:25:48.020,00:25:51.360
Sorry about this.,00:25:51.360,00:25:52.280
"Those of you in the back, feel
free to move forward.",00:25:52.280,00:26:04.100
All right.,00:26:04.100,00:26:08.520
"So we've got it, now
let's test it.",00:26:08.520,00:26:12.410
"So we're going to do
here, we're going",00:26:12.410,00:26:13.895
to run compare methods.,00:26:13.895,00:26:20.960
"Well we're seeing this famous
computers are no damn good.",00:26:20.960,00:26:32.860
All right.,00:26:32.860,00:26:34.210
"So we're going to try it on 2,
and at least we'll notice for",00:26:34.210,00:26:37.760
"2, that the bisection method
took eight iterations, the",00:26:37.760,00:26:43.580
"Newton Raphson only took three,",00:26:43.580,00:26:46.730
so it was more efficient.,00:26:46.730,00:26:49.620
"They came up with slightly
different answers, but both",00:26:49.620,00:26:52.990
"answers are within .01 which
is what I gave it here for",00:26:52.990,00:26:56.810
"epsilon, so we're OK.",00:26:56.810,00:26:59.890
"So even though they have
different answers, they both",00:26:59.890,00:27:02.740
"satisfy the same specification,",00:27:02.740,00:27:05.400
so we have no problem.,00:27:05.400,00:27:09.630
All right?,00:27:09.630,00:27:11.900
"Try it again, just for fun.",00:27:11.900,00:27:17.020
"I gave it here a different
epsilon, and you'll note, we",00:27:17.020,00:27:21.510
get different answers.,00:27:21.510,00:27:26.940
"Again, that's OK.",00:27:26.940,00:27:29.630
"Notice here, when I asked for
a more precise answer,",00:27:29.630,00:27:35.210
"bisection took a lot more
iterations, but Newton Raphson",00:27:35.210,00:27:43.440
"took only one extra iteration to
get that extra precision in",00:27:43.440,00:27:47.480
the answer.,00:27:47.480,00:27:49.860
"So we're sort of getting the
notion that Newton Raphson",00:27:49.860,00:27:54.110
"maybe is considerably better on
harder problems. Which, by",00:27:54.110,00:27:59.990
"the way, it is.",00:27:59.990,00:28:03.080
"We'll make it an even harder
problem, by making it looking",00:28:03.080,00:28:08.630
"an even smaller epsilon, and
again, what you'll see is,",00:28:08.630,00:28:13.370
"Newton Raphson just crept up by
one, didn't take it long,",00:28:13.370,00:28:19.290
"and got the better answer,
where bisection",00:28:19.290,00:28:22.070
gets worse and worse.,00:28:22.070,00:28:23.820
"So as you can see, as we
escalate the problem",00:28:23.820,00:28:26.860
"difficulty, the difference
between the good method and",00:28:26.860,00:28:30.720
"the not quite as good
method gets bigger",00:28:30.720,00:28:33.290
and bigger and bigger.,00:28:33.290,00:28:35.500
"That's an important observation,
and as we get to",00:28:35.500,00:28:38.470
"the part of the course, we
talk about computational",00:28:38.470,00:28:41.430
"complexity, you'll see that what
we really care about is",00:28:41.430,00:28:45.930
"not how efficient the program
is on easy problems, but how",00:28:45.930,00:28:49.850
efficient it is on hard,00:28:49.850,00:28:51.270
problems. All right.,00:28:51.270,00:28:57.960
Look at another example.,00:28:57.960,00:29:00.340
"All right, here I gave it
a big number, 123456789.",00:29:00.340,00:29:07.330
"And again, I don't want to
bore you, but you can see",00:29:07.330,00:29:11.130
"what's going on here
with this trend.",00:29:11.130,00:29:19.760
"So here's an interesting
question.",00:29:19.760,00:29:27.490
"You may notice that it's always

"That the computer is--
speaks for God.",00:30:53.180,00:30:58.640

that's infallible.",00:31:01.205,00:31:03.530

ways; one way is that it's",00:34:53.620,00:34:58.020

be other lists.",00:35:08.750,00:35:13.560
"So let's look at some
examples here.",00:35:13.560,00:35:18.930
"What we'll do, is we'll work
on two boards at once.",00:35:18.930,00:35:27.230
"So I could write a statement
like, techs, a variable, is",00:35:27.230,00:35:36.060
"equal to the list, written with
the square brace, not a",00:35:36.060,00:35:39.320
"parenthesis, MIT, Cal
Tech, closed brace.",00:35:39.320,00:35:55.700
"What that basically does, is it
takes the variable techs,",00:35:55.700,00:36:03.080
"and it now makes it point to a
list with two items in it.",00:36:03.080,00:36:15.590
"One is the string MIT and one
is the string Cal Tech.",00:36:15.590,00:36:25.780
So let's look at it.,00:36:25.780,00:36:29.900
"And we'll now run another little
test program, show",00:36:29.900,00:36:37.750
"lists, and I printed it,
and it prints the",00:36:37.750,00:36:41.330
"list MIT, Cal Tech.",00:36:41.330,00:36:49.200
"Now suppose I introduce a new
variable, we'll call it ivys,",00:36:49.200,00:36:55.310

list Harvard, Yale, Brown.",00:36:55.310,00:37:07.270
"Three of the ivy league
colleges.",00:37:07.270,00:37:11.110
"What that does is, I have a new
variable, ivys, and it's",00:37:11.110,00:37:16.080
"now pointing to another, what we
call object, in Python and",00:37:16.080,00:37:24.830
"Java, and many other languages,
think of these",00:37:24.830,00:37:28.090
"things that are sitting
there in memory",00:37:28.090,00:37:29.540
somewhere as objects.,00:37:29.540,00:37:31.970
"And I won't write it all out,
I'll just write it's got",00:37:31.970,00:37:34.730
"Harvard as one in it, and
then it's got Yale, and",00:37:34.730,00:37:39.930
then it's got Brown.,00:37:39.930,00:37:43.400
And I can now print ivys.,00:37:43.400,00:37:49.520
"And it sure enough prints what
we expected it to print.",00:37:49.520,00:37:55.570
"Now, let's say I have univs, for
universities, equals the",00:37:55.570,00:38:03.390
"empty list. That would create
something over here called",00:38:03.390,00:38:11.010
"univs, another variable, and it
will point to the list, an",00:38:11.010,00:38:16.780
"object that contains
nothing in it.",00:38:16.780,00:38:19.590
This is not the same as none.,00:38:19.590,00:38:22.950
"It's it does have a value, it
just happens to be the list",00:38:22.950,00:38:25.890
that has nothing in it.,00:38:25.890,00:38:29.480
"And the next thing I'm
going to write is",00:38:29.480,00:38:33.440
univs dot append tex.,00:38:33.440,00:38:50.120
What is this going to do?,00:38:50.120,00:38:54.370
"It's going to take this list and
add to it something else.",00:38:54.370,00:39:03.570
Let's look at the code.,00:39:03.570,00:39:17.690
"I'm going to print it, and
let's see what it prints.",00:39:17.690,00:39:21.680
It's kind of interesting.,00:39:21.680,00:39:24.710
Whoops.,00:39:24.710,00:39:25.290
Why did it do that?,00:39:25.290,00:39:27.380
That's not what I expected.,00:39:27.380,00:39:36.640
It's going to print that.,00:39:36.640,00:39:37.620
"The reason it printed that is
I accidentally had my finger",00:39:37.620,00:39:39.790
"on the control key, which said
print the last thing you had.",00:39:39.790,00:39:46.680
"Why does it start with square
braced square brace?",00:39:46.680,00:39:56.550
"I take it-- yes, go ahead.",00:39:56.550,00:39:58.040
"STUDENT: So you're adding
a list to a list?",00:39:58.040,00:40:01.320
"PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: So I'm
adding a list to a list. What",00:40:01.320,00:40:04.040
"have I-- what I've appended to
the empty list is not the",00:40:04.040,00:40:10.650
"elements MIT and Cal Tech
but the list that",00:40:10.650,00:40:15.850
contains those elements.,00:40:15.850,00:40:21.230
"So I've appended this
whole object.",00:40:21.230,00:40:24.470
"Since that object is itself
a list, what I get",00:40:24.470,00:40:28.920
is a list of lists.,00:40:28.920,00:40:37.190
"Now I should mention this
notation here append is what",00:40:37.190,00:40:49.340
is in Python called a method.,00:40:49.340,00:40:54.240
"Now we'll hear lots more about
methods when we get to classes",00:40:54.240,00:40:58.530
"and inheritance, but really, a
method is just a fancy word",00:40:58.530,00:41:03.930
"for a function with
different syntax.",00:41:03.930,00:41:08.670
"Think of this as a function that
takes two arguments, the",00:41:08.670,00:41:13.670
"first of which is univs and the
second of which is techs.",00:41:13.670,00:41:21.220
"And this is just a different
syntax for writing that",00:41:21.220,00:41:25.620
function call.,00:41:25.620,00:41:27.820
"Later in the term, we'll see
why we have this syntax and",00:41:27.820,00:41:33.400
"why it wasn't just a totally
arbitrary brain-dead decision",00:41:33.400,00:41:37.840
"by the designers of Python,
and many languages before",00:41:37.840,00:41:41.620
"Python, but in fact is a
pretty sensible thing.",00:41:41.620,00:41:45.970
"But for now, think of this as
just another way to write a",00:41:45.970,00:41:48.880
function call.,00:41:48.880,00:41:54.210
"All right, people
with me so far?",00:41:54.210,00:42:00.000
"Now let's say we wanted as the
next thing we'll do, is we're",00:42:00.000,00:42:08.390
"going to append the ivys
to univ. Stick",00:42:08.390,00:42:15.810
another list on it.,00:42:15.810,00:42:18.330
All right.,00:42:18.330,00:42:20.800
"So we'll do that, and now we get
MIT, Cal Tech, followed by",00:42:20.800,00:42:29.280
"that list followed by the list
Harvard, Yale, Brown.",00:42:29.280,00:42:32.700
"So now we have a list containing
two lists.",00:42:32.700,00:42:41.760
What are we going to try next?,00:42:41.760,00:42:45.330
"Well just to see what we know
what we're doing, let's look",00:42:45.330,00:42:49.280
at this code here.,00:42:49.280,00:42:56.550
"I've written a little for
loop, which is going to",00:42:56.550,00:42:59.800
"iterate over all of the elements
in the list. So",00:42:59.800,00:43:03.970
"remember, before we wrote things
like for i in range 10,",00:43:03.970,00:43:10.200
"which iterated over a list or
tuple of numbers, here you can",00:43:10.200,00:43:17.190
"iterate over any list, and so
we're going to just going to",00:43:17.190,00:43:20.070
"take the list called univs
and iterate over it.",00:43:20.070,00:43:26.250
"So the first thing we'll do is,
we'll print the element,",00:43:26.250,00:43:30.090
"in this case it will
be a list, right?",00:43:30.090,00:43:32.370
"Because it's a list with
two lists in it.",00:43:32.370,00:43:35.940
"Then the next thing in the loop,
we're going to enter a",00:43:35.940,00:43:38.510
"nested loop, and say for every
college in the list e, we're",00:43:38.510,00:43:46.050
"going to print the name
of the college.",00:43:46.050,00:43:51.390
"So now if we look what we get--
do you not want to try",00:43:51.390,00:43:59.790
"and execute that?-- it'll
first print the list",00:43:59.790,00:44:07.330
"containing MIT and Cal Tech,
and then separately the",00:44:07.330,00:44:11.020
"strings MIT and Cal Tech, and
then the list containing",00:44:11.020,00:44:14.990
"Harvard, Yale, and Brown, and
then the strings Harvard,",00:44:14.990,00:44:18.560
"Yale, and Brown.",00:44:18.560,00:44:21.380
"So we're beginning to see this
is a pretty powerful notion,",00:44:21.380,00:44:25.220
"these lists, and that
we can do a lot of",00:44:25.220,00:44:27.640
interesting things with them.,00:44:27.640,00:44:31.390
"Suppose I don't want all of this
structure, and I want to",00:44:31.390,00:44:37.640
"do what's called flattening the
list. Well I can do that",00:44:37.640,00:44:51.460
"by, instead of using the
method append, use the",00:44:51.460,00:44:56.560
concatenation operator.,00:44:56.560,00:45:00.400
"So I can concatenate techs
plus ivys and assign that",00:45:00.400,00:45:06.300
"result to univs, and then when
I print it you'll notice I",00:45:06.300,00:45:13.510
"just get a list of
five strings.",00:45:13.510,00:45:19.180
"So plus and append do very
different things.",00:45:19.180,00:45:24.110
"Append sticks the list on the
end of the list, append",00:45:24.110,00:45:30.440
"flattens it, one level
of course.",00:45:30.440,00:45:32.930
"If I had lists of lists of
lists, then it would only take",00:45:32.930,00:45:36.560
out the first level of it.,00:45:36.560,00:45:41.880
"OK, very quiet here.",00:45:41.880,00:45:45.150
"Any questions about
any of this?",00:45:45.150,00:45:49.350

"Because we're about to get
to the hard part Sigh.",00:45:49.670,00:45:53.790
All right.,00:45:53.790,00:45:54.290
"Let's look at the-- well,
suppose I want to, quite",00:45:54.290,00:45:58.400
"understandably, eliminate
Harvard.",00:45:58.400,00:46:00.260

down here, where I'm",00:46:00.260,00:46:05.650
going to remove it.,00:46:05.650,00:46:09.410
"So this is again another method,
this is remove, takes",00:46:09.410,00:46:13.200
"two arguments, the first
is ivys, the second",00:46:13.200,00:46:16.700
is the string Harvard.,00:46:16.700,00:46:21.210
"It's going to search through the
list until the first time",00:46:21.210,00:46:25.450
"it finds Harvard and then it's
going to yank it away.",00:46:25.450,00:46:39.030
So what happened here?,00:46:39.030,00:46:42.310
Did I jump to the wrong place?,00:46:42.310,00:46:45.650
STUDENT: You hit two returns.,00:46:45.650,00:46:45.950
"PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG:
I hit two returns.",00:46:45.950,00:46:46.533
Pardon?,00:46:46.533,00:46:46.590
STUDENT: You hit two returns.,00:46:46.590,00:46:47.323
One was at,00:46:47.323,00:46:47.950
STUDENT: Pardo,00:46:47.950,00:46:53.740
"PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG:
This one.",00:46:53.740,00:46:54.906
"STUDENT: No, up one.",00:46:54.906,00:46:55.560
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: Up one.,00:46:55.560,00:46:56.770
STUDENT: Right.,00:46:56.770,00:46:57.120
"PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: But
why is Harvard there?",00:46:57.120,00:46:57.790
"STUDENT: I'm sorry, I didn't
write it down.",00:46:57.790,00:47:00.180
"PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: Let's
look at it again.",00:47:00.180,00:47:00.900
"All right, it's time to
interrupt the world, and we'll",00:47:00.900,00:47:04.110
just type into the shell.,00:47:04.110,00:47:06.600
Let's see what we get here.,00:47:06.600,00:47:16.040
"All right, so let's just see
what we got, we'll print",00:47:16.040,00:47:18.310
"univs. Nope, not defined.",00:47:18.310,00:47:22.070
"All right, well let's do a list
equals, and we'll put",00:47:22.070,00:47:26.480
"some interesting things in it,
we'll put a number in it,",00:47:26.480,00:47:29.080
"because we can put a number,
we'll put MIT in it, because",00:47:29.080,00:47:33.350
"we can put strings, we'll put
another number in it, 3.3,",00:47:33.350,00:47:38.830
"because we can put floating
points, we can put all sorts",00:47:38.830,00:47:42.870
"of things in this list. We can
put a list in the list again,",00:47:42.870,00:47:45.540
as we've seen before.,00:47:45.540,00:47:47.920
"So let's put the list containing
the string a, and",00:47:47.920,00:47:53.370
"I'll print out, so now we see
something pretty interesting",00:47:53.370,00:47:57.720
"about a list, that we can mix up
all sorts of things in it,",00:47:57.720,00:48:03.400
and that's OK.,00:48:03.400,00:48:06.300
"You'll notice I have the string
with the number 1, a",00:48:06.300,00:48:08.940
"string with MIT, and then it
just a plain old number, not a",00:48:08.940,00:48:12.750
"string, again it didn't quite
give me 3.3 for reasons we've",00:48:12.750,00:48:16.810
"talked before, and now
it in the list a.",00:48:16.810,00:48:21.050
"So, suppose I want to
remove something.",00:48:21.050,00:48:27.020
"What should we try and remove
from this list?",00:48:27.020,00:48:32.530
Anybody want to vote?,00:48:32.530,00:48:37.100
Pardon?,00:48:37.100,00:48:38.320
"All right, someone wants
to remove MIT.",00:48:38.320,00:48:42.590
Sad but true.,00:48:42.590,00:48:45.450
"Now what do we get
if we print l?",00:48:45.450,00:48:47.800
MIT is gone.,00:48:47.800,00:48:51.290
"How do I talk about the
different pieces of l?",00:48:51.290,00:48:54.900
"Well I can do this. l sub 0--
whoops-- will give me the",00:48:54.900,00:49:04.210
"first element of the list,
just as we could do with",00:49:04.210,00:49:09.580
"strings, and I can look at l
sub minus 1 to get the last",00:49:09.580,00:49:13.380
"element of the list, so I can
do all the strings, all the",00:49:13.380,00:49:17.070
"things that I could
do with strings.",00:49:17.070,00:49:20.860
"It's extremely powerful,
but what we",00:49:20.860,00:49:23.460
haven't seen yet is mutation.,00:49:23.460,00:49:29.760
"Well, we have seen
mutation, right?",00:49:29.760,00:49:32.730
"Because notice that what remove
did, it was it actually",00:49:32.730,00:49:36.960
"changed the list. Didn't create
a new list. The old l",00:49:36.960,00:49:42.650
"is still there, but it's
different than it used to be.",00:49:42.650,00:49:47.360
"So this is very different from
what we did with slicing,",00:49:47.360,00:49:51.730
"where we got a new copy
of something.",00:49:51.730,00:49:54.250
"Here we took the old one
and we just changed it.",00:49:54.250,00:49:59.350
"On Thursday, we'll look at why
that allows you to do lots of",00:49:59.350,00:50:05.150
"things more conveniently than
you can do without mutation.",00:50:05.150,00:50:10.170
