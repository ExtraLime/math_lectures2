&gt;&gt; [MUSIC PLAYING],00:00:00.000,00:00:11.210
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: All right, welcome
back to CS50.",00:00:11.210,00:00:14.640
"This is the end of week eight,
and almost Halloween.",00:00:14.640,00:00:18.190
"Tomorrow night's office hours will be
the scariest ones yet, and not because",00:00:18.190,00:00:22.460
of Halloween.,00:00:22.460,00:00:23.460
"&gt;&gt; But on that note, do realize that
problem set six, the spell checking",00:00:23.460,00:00:28.600
"problem set, is renowned to be, for many
students, the most challenging,",00:00:28.600,00:00:32.340
"certainly among the C problem sets,
and really, in general.",00:00:32.340,00:00:36.010
"And I mention this only because this is
the week where a lot of people get",00:00:36.010,00:00:39.250
"particularly stressed with just trying
to get the damn spell checker to work.",00:00:39.250,00:00:42.840
"And the one thing I would encourage you
is that, as you'll see today, and",00:00:42.840,00:00:45.640
"on Monday, we begin to hit this peak
this week where, now, things become a",00:00:45.640,00:00:49.670
"little more familiar, a little more
accessible, as we transition from a",00:00:49.670,00:00:52.370
"command line environment in C to
a web based environment in PHP.",00:00:52.370,00:00:56.120
"&gt;&gt; And so I'd encourage you, even if you're
really at your wit's end in",00:00:56.120,00:00:59.805
"trying to get the p set to work, if
that's indeed the place you're at, or",00:00:59.805,00:01:02.785
"find yourself at, do try
to power through it.",00:01:02.785,00:01:05.770
"Because I do think you'll be quite
pleased, and quite proud of yourself,",00:01:05.770,00:01:08.280
"if you really end that portion of the
course, the C portion, on that high,",00:01:08.280,00:01:12.300
"if stressful, note.",00:01:12.300,00:01:13.310
So that's not to scare.,00:01:13.310,00:01:14.120
"That's just meant to encourage you to
stay up that extra hour in order to",00:01:14.120,00:01:18.010
get the spell checking working.,00:01:18.010,00:01:19.820
"&gt;&gt; And if you do, realize that this
is optional, entirely.",00:01:19.820,00:01:22.730
"But we have the so-called big board
that went live this morning.",00:01:22.730,00:01:25.720
"As of this morning, I was atop the big
board, which is a measurement of how",00:01:25.720,00:01:29.950
"much RAM and how much running time
your program speller requires.",00:01:29.950,00:01:34.450
But I've since been displaced.,00:01:34.450,00:01:35.890
I'm now the unlucky number 13.,00:01:35.890,00:01:37.910
"And what you'll see here is, David
Kaufman, and Lauren, and Adam, and",00:01:37.910,00:01:41.460
"Jason, and others are now
atop the big board.",00:01:41.460,00:01:44.130
"&gt;&gt; If you look over there at the right,
all of us have really good",00:01:44.130,00:01:47.480
implementations of size at least--,00:01:47.480,00:01:49.890
"returning the number of words
in the dictionary.",00:01:49.890,00:01:51.640
"And in each of these columns, you'll
see how much RAM each of our",00:01:51.640,00:01:54.690
"implementations is using, how much
running time it's taking to execute",00:01:54.690,00:01:58.370
"load, versus check, versus size
and unload, and then, the",00:01:58.370,00:02:01.450
total running time.,00:02:01.450,00:02:02.490
"So just to reassure Elmer, and Patrick,
and Linda, and everyone else",00:02:02.490,00:02:05.990
"who comes after you, there's absolutely
no shame in being toward",00:02:05.990,00:02:09.210
the bottom of the big board.,00:02:09.210,00:02:10.590
"If anything, that means you got working,
and it's correct, but it's",00:02:10.590,00:02:13.950
"not necessarily as efficient, space
or time-wise, as it might be.",00:02:13.950,00:02:18.480
"&gt;&gt; So, totally optional.",00:02:18.480,00:02:19.430
"But meant to be a carrot of sorts so
that when you're working on your p",00:02:19.430,00:02:22.630
"set, you're so proud of yourself, you
got it working, you post to the big",00:02:22.630,00:02:25.960
"board, you've got a really good number,
you go to dinner, you come",00:02:25.960,00:02:28.920
"back, and your roommates has edged
you out on the big board.",00:02:28.920,00:02:31.810
"Well, it's time, at that point, to go
back to the drawing board so as to",00:02:31.810,00:02:34.910
re-challenge the big board.,00:02:34.910,00:02:36.160
"If you look at the spec, the
instructions for interfacing with the",00:02:36.160,00:02:39.330
big board are now posted.,00:02:39.330,00:02:41.480
&gt;&gt; So a couple of heads ups--,00:02:41.480,00:02:44.870
"one, the pre-proposal for the final
project is due this coming Monday.",00:02:44.870,00:02:48.410
"See this spec on the course's
website for what that means.",00:02:48.410,00:02:51.060
"It's really just a casual but thought
provoking email between you and your",00:02:51.060,00:02:54.450
"TF, really just to get things started,
the conversation started, even though",00:02:54.450,00:02:58.410
"most of you have never even written a
web page before, don't even know what",00:02:58.410,00:03:02.110
"you might, how you might, implement
your final project.",00:03:02.110,00:03:04.850
"Go on faith that you'll know
how to do quite a few more",00:03:04.850,00:03:07.250
things in a few weeks.,00:03:07.250,00:03:08.410
"So just begin this process per the
spec of exploring possible ideas.",00:03:08.410,00:03:12.900
"&gt;&gt; Also, what we'd invite you to do is--
we have a tradition, for many years",00:03:12.900,00:03:16.030
"now, in the course, of hosting
this-- store.cs50.net.",00:03:16.030,00:03:18.840
Everything's sold at cost.,00:03:18.840,00:03:20.010
"And it's really just an opportunity to
wear CS50, if you would like to do",00:03:20.010,00:03:23.460
"that, at course's and.",00:03:23.460,00:03:24.920
"For instance, there are such things as
the t-shirts that you might have seen",00:03:24.920,00:03:27.990
"going around campus, sweatshirts.",00:03:27.990,00:03:29.880
"And then, we also invite students to
submit designs to be immortalized in",00:03:29.880,00:03:33.960
the CS50 store.,00:03:33.960,00:03:35.330
"&gt;&gt; For instance, one of last year's
favorites that will, perhaps, now",00:03:35.330,00:03:39.910
resonate with you is this one here.,00:03:39.910,00:03:41.860
Very popular item.,00:03:45.390,00:03:46.820
"So if you would like to participate in
this, we'll put up a form soon, at",00:03:46.820,00:03:51.020
"cs50.net/design, to which you can upload
an image that you've made in",00:03:51.020,00:03:54.240
"Illustrator, or Photoshop,
or some similar program.",00:03:54.240,00:03:56.990
"And if you're familiar with these kinds
of specifications, we want it to",00:03:56.990,00:03:59.850
"be a PNG image, at least 200 dots per
inch, and fewer than that many pixels,",00:03:59.850,00:04:05.010
and under 10 megabytes.,00:04:05.010,00:04:07.680
"For more details, just email the
course's heads at heads@cs50.net if",00:04:07.680,00:04:11.260
you would like to partake in this.,00:04:11.260,00:04:13.910
"&gt;&gt; All right, so today, no more C. So we
begin to pull back the layers of the",00:04:13.910,00:04:20.920
"internet, the web, and how you can
actually start writing software for",00:04:20.920,00:04:24.900
this different environment.,00:04:24.900,00:04:26.420
"So in particular, let's ask,
first, the question of--",00:04:26.420,00:04:31.420
"let me get us to our familiar
drawing app over here.",00:04:31.420,00:04:36.070
"Let me pose the question of,
how does the internet work.",00:04:36.070,00:04:42.702
&gt;&gt; [? STUDENT: Magic. ?],00:04:42.702,00:04:43.560
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Magic.,00:04:43.560,00:04:44.010
OK.,00:04:44.010,00:04:44.940
Good answer.,00:04:44.940,00:04:45.880
"So we'll start there today, and see if
we can't make it a little less magical",00:04:45.880,00:04:49.460
within the hour.,00:04:49.460,00:04:50.880
"Let's try to tell it in the
context of a story.",00:04:50.880,00:04:53.850
"&gt;&gt; So you're fans of going to facebook.com,
or reddit.com, or",00:04:53.850,00:04:58.480
whatever these days.,00:04:58.480,00:04:59.780
"And so what's really happening when
you type in something like",00:04:59.780,00:05:02.590
"facebook.com, and hit Enter, in Chrome,
or Firefox, or IE, or Safari,",00:05:02.590,00:05:07.020
"or whatever browser you're
actually doing?",00:05:07.020,00:05:09.050
"Can we tell this story, maybe
sentence by sentence?",00:05:09.050,00:05:11.500
"What's one of the first things that
happens when you hit Enter, after",00:05:11.500,00:05:14.770
typing facebook.com?,00:05:14.770,00:05:15.876
"&gt;&gt; [? STUDENT: Your ?] computer
makes an HTTP request.",00:05:15.876,00:05:17.780
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: OK.,00:05:17.780,00:05:18.260
"So your computer makes-- we'll
call it-- an HTTP request.",00:05:18.260,00:05:21.900
Now what does that mean?,00:05:21.900,00:05:22.940
"Well, all of us have probably seen or
typed, for years now, H-T-T-P often",00:05:22.940,00:05:27.980
"followed by colon, slash, slash.",00:05:27.980,00:05:29.186
So what is that?,00:05:29.186,00:05:30.340
"&gt;&gt; Well, HTTP is HyperText
Transfer Protocol.",00:05:30.340,00:05:33.980
"And that's just a fancy way of saying,
it's the language that web browsers,",00:05:33.980,00:05:37.360
"like Chrome and others, and web servers,
like facebook.com, speak to",00:05:37.360,00:05:42.460
one another.,00:05:42.460,00:05:43.100
"And it's a fairly simple, English
oriented language.",00:05:43.100,00:05:46.730
It's almost like pseudo code.,00:05:46.730,00:05:48.140
"&gt;&gt; And it's a way of a client, as
we'll call it-- a browser--",00:05:48.140,00:05:51.820
communicating with the server.,00:05:51.820,00:05:53.150
"And just like in a restaurant, when you,
the client, sit down at a table",00:05:53.150,00:05:56.230
"and then order something off of the
menu of the server, that server's",00:05:56.230,00:05:59.630
"going to bring you back something,
whatever it is you requested.",00:05:59.630,00:06:02.720
Same in the computer world.,00:06:02.720,00:06:04.270
A browser--,00:06:04.270,00:06:04.970
a client--,00:06:04.970,00:06:05.610
"is going to make a request, and
then, hopefully get back",00:06:05.610,00:06:07.890
something from the server.,00:06:07.890,00:06:09.120
"And that something is, at a
high level, the web page.",00:06:09.120,00:06:11.660
"At a slightly lower level, it's
a file written in another",00:06:11.660,00:06:15.040
language called HTML--,00:06:15.040,00:06:17.160
HyperText Markup Language.,00:06:17.160,00:06:18.920
But more on that in just a moment.,00:06:18.920,00:06:20.720
&gt;&gt; So HyperText Transfer Protocol--,00:06:20.720,00:06:22.470
HTTP--,00:06:22.470,00:06:23.450
"that's the protocol that
browser and server use.",00:06:23.450,00:06:26.050
"Well, what is a protocol, exactly?",00:06:26.050,00:06:27.830
"Well, you can think of
it as a language.",00:06:27.830,00:06:29.280
"But if I reach out to our audience here,
a normal thing for us humans to",00:06:29.280,00:06:32.580
"do is, when we greet someone,
I say, hi, my name is David.",00:06:32.580,00:06:35.928
"&gt;&gt; [? STUDENT: Hi, ?] my name is Dipty.",00:06:35.928,00:06:37.320
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: ""Hi, my name is
Dipty,"" she replies.",00:06:37.320,00:06:39.000
"And so we've had this fairly arbitrary
interaction of shaking hands, as is",00:06:39.000,00:06:43.530
"often the human convention
in most countries.",00:06:43.530,00:06:45.730
"And that's a protocol, right?",00:06:45.730,00:06:47.380
"I sort of initiated it by extending my
hand, rather awkwardly, on the stage",00:06:47.380,00:06:50.680
of Sanders here.,00:06:50.680,00:06:51.610
"She realized, oh, I've gotten a
request for a hand apparently.",00:06:51.610,00:06:54.670
"And so she responded to that request
by actually acknowledging it.",00:06:54.670,00:06:58.170
"An acknowledging, ACK, is actually a
phrase very common in the world of",00:06:58.170,00:07:01.860
"networking, for a server to
acknowledge the client.",00:07:01.860,00:07:04.060
"Then, we sort of completed that
transaction, and awkwardness over.",00:07:04.060,00:07:07.720
"So that's really what's happening
underneath the hood as well.",00:07:07.720,00:07:10.010
"&gt;&gt; Let me do this a little more
technically under the hood.",00:07:10.010,00:07:13.450
"I'm going to go over here
to a terminal window.",00:07:13.450,00:07:16.900
"This terminal window happens to be on my
Mac, but you could do the same kind",00:07:16.900,00:07:19.950
of thing in CS50 Appliance.,00:07:19.950,00:07:21.760
"And I'm actually going to use a program
that we won't really used for",00:07:21.760,00:07:24.750
much at all the semester.,00:07:24.750,00:07:26.300
But it's called Telnet.,00:07:26.300,00:07:27.430
"&gt;&gt; Back in the day, Telnet was the program
that you used to connect to a",00:07:27.430,00:07:31.880
"remote server, to check your mail
or to do something like that.",00:07:31.880,00:07:34.910
"For now, we're going to use this old
school program, Telnet, to pretend to",00:07:34.910,00:07:38.460
be a browser.,00:07:38.460,00:07:39.830
"And I'm going to go ahead and
do the following-- let me",00:07:39.830,00:07:41.550
increase my font size.,00:07:41.550,00:07:42.800
"&gt;&gt; And I'm going to say, Telnet to the
server called www.facebook.com, but",00:07:42.800,00:07:48.080
"specifically, Telnet to port 80.",00:07:48.080,00:07:50.980
We'll come back to this.,00:07:50.980,00:07:52.070
"But for now, know that most services
on the internet are identified",00:07:52.070,00:07:56.630
uniquely by some number.,00:07:56.630,00:07:58.170
"In this case, it's 80.",00:07:58.170,00:07:59.460
"Now most of you have probably
never typed 80 before.",00:07:59.460,00:08:02.910
"But in reality, if I go to a browser
and pull up, for instance,",00:08:02.910,00:08:08.540
http://www.facebook.com/--,00:08:08.540,00:08:16.500
"that's auto-complete, that's
not my history--",00:08:16.500,00:08:18.460
"all right, so now, we go
to colon 80 slash.",00:08:18.460,00:08:23.070
"&gt;&gt; So I claim that even though you've
probably never typed this before, with",00:08:23.070,00:08:26.270
"the colon 80 after facebook.com,
hopefully, it's still going to work.",00:08:26.270,00:08:30.310
"And indeed, it goes to facebook.com.",00:08:30.310,00:08:32.220
"So it turns out that 80
has been implicit.",00:08:32.220,00:08:34.860
"None of us humans have had
to type that for years.",00:08:34.860,00:08:36.690
"Because browsers, by default, just
assume that the number you want to use",00:08:36.690,00:08:41.350
"when calling up a server so
to speak is, in fact, 80.",00:08:41.350,00:08:44.620
"Because long story short, servers
can do way more than just",00:08:44.620,00:08:47.340
serve up web pages.,00:08:47.340,00:08:48.320
&gt;&gt; They can respond to instant messages.,00:08:48.320,00:08:50.030
They can send emails.,00:08:50.030,00:08:51.230
"There's lots of services that
can run on a single server.",00:08:51.230,00:08:54.410
"So these numbers-- in this case, 80--
uniquely identifies one of those",00:08:54.410,00:08:57.590
"services, which is HTTP, the
web protocol than a server",00:08:57.590,00:09:01.830
might actually support.,00:09:01.830,00:09:03.210
"But I can simulate this request now,
textually, using this old school",00:09:03.210,00:09:07.250
Telnet program.,00:09:07.250,00:09:08.240
"So I'm going to essentially now pretend

"by sending, with my keyboard, exactly
the commands that Chrome just knew how",00:09:12.940,00:09:16.620
to send for me magically.,00:09:16.620,00:09:18.260
"&gt;&gt; So I'm going to go ahead
and hit Enter.",00:09:18.260,00:09:19.910
Notice that it's trying 31.13.69.32.,00:09:19.910,00:09:22.000
13 What is that?,00:09:22.000,00:09:26.110
So it's an IP address.,00:09:26.110,00:09:27.440
"Now even if you're not too familiar
with the intricacies of those, you",00:09:27.440,00:09:30.790
"probably have a general sense
that these things exist.",00:09:30.790,00:09:33.420
And an IP address--,00:09:33.420,00:09:34.650
Internet Protocol address--,00:09:34.650,00:09:36.620
"is just a unique identifier for
a computer on the internet.",00:09:36.620,00:09:40.970
"This is a bit of an oversimplification
for the moment.",00:09:40.970,00:09:43.040
"&gt;&gt; But every computer on the internet has
a unique IP address, much like every",00:09:43.040,00:09:47.490
"house in, say, the US has a unique
postal address, something like 123",00:09:47.490,00:09:53.600
"Main Street, in Anytown, USA.",00:09:53.600,00:09:55.820
So something like that.,00:09:55.820,00:09:56.540
"And that, too, is oversimplification.",00:09:56.540,00:09:58.330
"But these addresses that we have in the
postal world and these addresses",00:09:58.330,00:10:01.470
"that we have in the computer world

"you send a message to them over the
internet, or when you put a letter in",00:10:04.940,00:10:09.030

"&gt;&gt; Now my computer, somehow, has just
figured out that Facebook's unique IP",00:10:18.110,00:10:21.390
is 31.13.69.32.,00:10:21.390,00:10:23.820
"In fact, that can probably change.",00:10:23.820,00:10:25.170
"Facebook probably has multiple IP
addresses, because they absolutely",00:10:25.170,00:10:27.780
have more than one server.,00:10:27.780,00:10:29.150
But that's happened for us magically.,00:10:29.150,00:10:30.810
"In fact, the internal secret name of the
server I've apparently connected",00:10:30.810,00:10:35.070

"call this particular server that I
was somewhat randomly sent to.",00:10:42.960,00:10:46.510

timed out, I'm going to",00:10:46.510,00:10:48.630
pretend to be that browser.,00:10:48.630,00:10:50.210
"I'm going to say get space
forward slash space.",00:10:50.210,00:10:54.590
"And I'm going to pretend to be speaking
HTTP version 1.1, which is",00:10:54.590,00:10:58.220
the one that most browsers use.,00:10:58.220,00:10:59.880
"And I'm specifically going to mention to
the server, by the way, I want the",00:10:59.880,00:11:03.980

"&gt;&gt; The server, the waiter, has responded
to my order, or my request, with",00:11:11.390,00:11:16.400
another textual message.,00:11:16.400,00:11:17.720

"Microsoft and Google just hide
these details from us.",00:11:21.990,00:11:24.770
"But Facebook has responded with an
answer, also in the language HTTP.",00:11:24.770,00:11:29.580
"Notice there's a code here, 302, which
actually has special significance by",00:11:29.580,00:11:33.250
convention.,00:11:33.250,00:11:34.110
"Found, so that's at least promising.",00:11:34.110,00:11:36.030
"&gt;&gt; But apparently Facebook is telling
me, mm-mm, you don't want",00:11:36.030,00:11:39.160
what you asked for.,00:11:39.160,00:11:40.190
"You instead want today's

facebook.com/unsupportedbrowser.,00:11:42.810,00:11:45.680
"So at a high level, what does Facebook
appear to be doing here?",00:11:45.680,00:11:50.350
It's redirecting me.,00:11:50.350,00:11:51.410
"So Facebook doesn't like the
fact that I'm pretending to",00:11:51.410,00:11:53.420
be this other browser.,00:11:53.420,00:11:54.770
"And so it's redirecting
me to some website.",00:11:54.770,00:11:57.700
"&gt;&gt; I'm actually curious, now, what
this thing looks like.",00:11:57.700,00:11:59.820
"Let me go over to that in Chrome so we
can see what they want me to see.",00:11:59.820,00:12:04.420
"So now they've actually sent me back to
Facebook because they've realized,",00:12:04.420,00:12:07.060
"oh, you do have a supported browser.",00:12:07.060,00:12:08.360
"We're not even going to
show you that page.",00:12:08.360,00:12:10.260
"So let's go ahead and see
if we can't fix this.",00:12:10.260,00:12:12.920
"&gt;&gt; I'm going to have to
cheat a little bit.",00:12:12.920,00:12:14.280
And more on this in the weeks to come.,00:12:14.280,00:12:16.350
But I'm going to do one thing here.,00:12:16.350,00:12:18.120
And I'll explain this before long.,00:12:18.120,00:12:20.590
"Give me just a moment to
cheat, and wow you.",00:12:20.590,00:12:24.320
So let me get this.,00:12:24.320,00:12:28.190
OK.,00:12:28.190,00:12:29.110
"I'll explain what I'm doing
in just a moment.",00:12:29.110,00:12:30.690
"I'm going to go ahead and cancel this
connection, and try this again.",00:12:30.690,00:12:32.810
"&gt;&gt; Get slash HTTP 1.1 host www.facebook.com
user-agent.",00:12:32.810,00:12:38.440
OK.,00:12:43.880,00:12:44.560
Now I have pretended to be Chrome.,00:12:44.560,00:12:46.820
"So it turns out that when a browser
sends a request to a server, it's just",00:12:46.820,00:12:50.920
the honor system.,00:12:50.920,00:12:51.595
"If I say I'm Chrome, Facebook
will assume I'm Chrome.",00:12:51.595,00:12:54.840
"And the means by which I identified
myself as Chrome is by this",00:12:54.840,00:12:58.560
atrociously long string.,00:12:58.560,00:13:00.360
"Essentially, all the browser
manufacturers in the world have",00:13:00.360,00:13:03.240
"decided, well, this version of this
browser on this operating system will",00:13:03.240,00:13:06.470

like that crazy mess there.",00:13:06.470,00:13:09.740
"And Mozilla is in there for
historical reasons.",00:13:09.740,00:13:12.110
"&gt;&gt; But notice how much information I'm
leaking to facebook.com without even",00:13:12.110,00:13:15.160
logging in.,00:13:15.160,00:13:16.030

a Mac that I'm using.",00:13:16.030,00:13:18.910
"I'm telling him that it's an Intel
based Mac running Mac OS 10.8.5.",00:13:18.910,00:13:23.590
"As an aside, this information is going
to every website that you visit with",00:13:23.590,00:13:27.870
your browser.,00:13:27.870,00:13:28.500
"Pretty innocuous so far, but
it gets a little juicier.",00:13:28.500,00:13:31.360
"&gt;&gt; Notice that, if we read far enough,
I'm using Chrome version",00:13:31.360,00:13:33.920
30.0.1599.101.,00:13:33.920,00:13:38.060
"But now, notice that the response
is not as bad as it was before.",00:13:38.060,00:13:42.410
"Where is Facebook telling
me to go now?",00:13:42.410,00:13:44.840
"It's telling me, again, the website--",00:13:44.840,00:13:49.140
"it's telling me it's
moved permanently.",00:13:49.140,00:13:50.720
"Well, where the heck did Facebook go?",00:13:50.720,00:13:54.200
"&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's a subtle difference.",00:13:54.200,00:13:56.100
"But notice, here, that the website
has actually relocated to HTTPS.",00:13:56.100,00:14:01.680
"So long story short, this is one way
that Facebook is enforcing that I",00:14:01.680,00:14:05.210
"actually end up at the secure version of
their website, the one that's using",00:14:05.210,00:14:08.890
encryption--,00:14:08.890,00:14:09.660
"more complex than the encryption we
talked about for p set two, but",00:14:09.660,00:14:12.730
encryption nonetheless.,00:14:12.730,00:14:14.520
"&gt;&gt; Now at this point it gets hard
for me to spoof their web",00:14:14.520,00:14:17.110
request using Telnet.,00:14:17.110,00:14:18.230
"Because if they're telling
me to use SSL--",00:14:18.230,00:14:20.210
"the HTTPS prefix is what
that implies--",00:14:20.210,00:14:23.050
"if they're telling me to use
cryptography, there's no way I'm going",00:14:23.050,00:14:25.590
"to manually encrypt my message in front
of all of you here, and try to",00:14:25.590,00:14:28.610
figure out how to do that.,00:14:28.610,00:14:29.770
"It's just going to get
much more complex.",00:14:29.770,00:14:31.150
"But that's what the browser
is doing for you.",00:14:31.150,00:14:33.150
"&gt;&gt; Let's see if we can't do this a little
more simply, then, with a website",00:14:33.150,00:14:36.230
"that's not expecting
us to be as secure.",00:14:36.230,00:14:38.700
"Let's go to, say, harvard.edu
on port 80.",00:14:38.700,00:14:43.310
Enter.,00:14:43.310,00:14:44.550
"All right, so get slash HTTP 1.1.",00:14:44.550,00:14:48.170
And what does this first slash mean?,00:14:48.170,00:14:49.730
"Just to be clear, why do
I keep typing that?",00:14:49.730,00:14:53.120
"&gt;&gt; Well normally, when you type a URL--",00:14:53.120,00:14:54.790
"and unfortunately, browsers usually
hide this these days--",00:14:54.790,00:14:57.610
"normally, when you go to harvard.edu,
that URL officially",00:14:57.610,00:15:00.850
does end in a slash.,00:15:00.850,00:15:02.560
"Because a single slash denotes
what part of the hard drive?",00:15:02.560,00:15:07.350
The root of the hard drive.,00:15:07.350,00:15:08.990
"We in the Appliance haven't really had
to think about this, because we're",00:15:08.990,00:15:11.260
always in John Harvard's folder.,00:15:11.260,00:15:12.930
But his folder's in another folder.,00:15:12.930,00:15:14.690
"And that folder's in the root of the
Appliance's hard drive, so to speak,",00:15:14.690,00:15:17.980
even though it's virtual.,00:15:17.980,00:15:18.980
"So a single slash like this means
the root of the hard drive.",00:15:18.980,00:15:21.660
"It's like C colon backslash, or it's
the root of your volume, on Mac OS.",00:15:21.660,00:15:25.650
"&gt;&gt; But Chrome, and other browsers these
days, have gotten user-friendly, and",00:15:25.650,00:15:28.740
they hide that slash altogether.,00:15:28.740,00:15:30.300
"But that's all that means
in my textual message--",00:15:30.300,00:15:32.620
"give me the root of harvard.edu's
homepage, that is, the",00:15:32.620,00:15:36.570
default page itself.,00:15:36.570,00:15:38.120
So let me go ahead and hit Enter.,00:15:38.120,00:15:39.900
"Let me remind the host that I want

"other websites living on the
same physical server.",00:15:43.650,00:15:45.880
&gt;&gt; OK.,00:15:45.880,00:15:46.080
"Harvard got a little
impatient with me.",00:15:46.080,00:15:47.700

"hello, harvard.edu.",00:16:05.310,00:16:07.800
Why is it doing the-- interesting.,00:16:07.800,00:16:10.280
"Oh, OK.",00:16:10.280,00:16:11.710
"&gt;&gt; So what Harvard's now doing-- and we're
going to quickly veer off of",00:16:11.710,00:16:14.830
"this path, because it's going
to get tedious quickly--",00:16:14.830,00:16:17.100
"notice that Harvard is actually
compressing its response to me, which",00:16:17.100,00:16:21.270
isn't ideal.,00:16:21.270,00:16:22.140
"Because I, apparently, as a human, don't
know how to decompress bits that",00:16:22.140,00:16:25.780
have been sent to me compressed.,00:16:25.780,00:16:27.280
"And they're being shown is garbage
there, because they're zeros and ones,",00:16:27.280,00:16:31.500
but they're not ASCII characters.,00:16:31.500,00:16:33.190

have been compressed to take up",00:16:33.190,00:16:36.090
less space.,00:16:36.090,00:16:37.050
"&gt;&gt; So very quickly, let me see
if I can recover here.",00:16:37.050,00:16:39.010
"Let's try, maybe, another
campus altogether.",00:16:39.010,00:16:41.590

OK.,00:16:51.600,00:16:52.630
So here we have a web page.,00:16:52.630,00:16:55.750

known as HTML--",00:16:55.750,00:16:58.840

visit www.mit.edu, notice that,",00:18:00.590,00:18:06.300
"indeed, in the title up here,
is MIT dash Massachusetts",00:18:06.300,00:18:09.680
"Institute dot, dot, dot.",00:18:09.680,00:18:11.260
"And now notice, too, if I right click or
control click on the desktop here,",00:18:11.260,00:18:16.490
and go to View Page Source--,00:18:16.490,00:18:17.960
"at least in Chrome, though every browser
does this via some means--",00:18:17.960,00:18:20.870
here is that same file.,00:18:20.870,00:18:22.140
"&gt;&gt; It happens to be color coded,
or syntax highlighted.",00:18:22.140,00:18:25.140
"But just like with your C code that
was not colorized by you, it was",00:18:25.140,00:18:28.590
"colorized by gedit, similarly
is Chrome just making",00:18:28.590,00:18:31.810
this prettier to read.,00:18:31.810,00:18:33.130
"But this is the stuff that
we'll soon be writing.",00:18:33.130,00:18:37.110
So that's the endgame.,00:18:37.110,00:18:38.840
"The server has responded with that
information, just like you responded",00:18:38.840,00:18:42.020
with your hand for our handshake.,00:18:42.020,00:18:43.660
"But what else has to be going
on in between those steps?",00:18:43.660,00:18:47.280
"&gt;&gt; Well, when I type in, in this last case,
www.mit.edu and hit Enter, we",00:18:47.280,00:18:53.430
"know it's talking to port
80 automatically, port",00:18:53.430,00:18:56.390
just being that number.,00:18:56.390,00:18:57.780
But where did the IP address go?,00:18:57.780,00:19:00.710
"How is my computer figuring out what
the IP address of mit.edu is?",00:19:00.710,00:19:05.045
"&gt;&gt; Well, it turns out, in this world, there
are things called DNS servers.",00:19:07.720,00:19:10.840
"And let me go ahead and draw
a quick picture over here.",00:19:10.840,00:19:14.500
"And this'll just sketch out, in
rough terms, what's going on.",00:19:14.500,00:19:17.680
"So we'll pretend like this is
my laptop here, in Sanders.",00:19:17.680,00:19:21.510
"And it has Wi-Fi, so it's connected
wirelessly to something.",00:19:21.510,00:19:24.650
&gt;&gt; What's it actually connected to?,00:19:24.650,00:19:26.060
"Well, somewhere in here, there's
something on the",00:19:26.060,00:19:27.990
wall with some antennas.,00:19:27.990,00:19:29.240
And that's called an access point--,00:19:29.240,00:19:30.725
AP.,00:19:30.725,00:19:31.560
"Wireless access point, wireless router--
call it whatever you want.",00:19:31.560,00:19:34.190
"But they're all over campus,
with those little antennas.",00:19:34.190,00:19:36.230
"Ours are made by Cisco, typically.",00:19:36.230,00:19:38.100
"And so somehow, my computer is talking
to that wireless access point,",00:19:38.100,00:19:42.480
"somewhere here in Sanders, or
downstairs, or outside.",00:19:42.480,00:19:45.580
"&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, this thing has a lot of
physical wires going to, probably, the",00:19:45.580,00:19:50.030
"Science Center, which we'll
draw like this.",00:19:50.030,00:19:52.175
It doesn't actually look like that.,00:19:52.175,00:19:54.200
That actually looks a lot better.,00:19:54.200,00:19:55.200
"So the Science Center has a whole bunch
of computers inside of it that",00:19:55.200,00:19:59.170
"are somehow physically connected to all
of these access points on campus.",00:19:59.170,00:20:02.320
"And those physical computers, we'll
call routers, or gateways.",00:20:02.320,00:20:06.440
"&gt;&gt; A router, as its name suggests, it's
purpose in life is to route",00:20:06.440,00:20:09.450
information.,00:20:09.450,00:20:10.310
"It takes some bits, from a computer,
as input, and figures out to where",00:20:10.310,00:20:14.150
those bits should be sent.,00:20:14.150,00:20:15.640
"So in the case of my request for
mit.edu, it's actually pretty easy.",00:20:15.640,00:20:19.910
"My request comes in from my browser,
over Wi-Fi, to the access point, then,",00:20:19.910,00:20:24.620
"via some cable, into a router
in the Science Center.",00:20:24.620,00:20:27.080
"And somehow, the router in the
Science Center figures out",00:20:27.080,00:20:29.810
that MIT is that way.,00:20:29.810,00:20:31.510
"And I'm going to move forward those
bits, I'm going to route those bits,",00:20:31.510,00:20:34.080
"down the road, down Mass Ave., to MIT.",00:20:34.080,00:20:36.670
"But how did my computer know what
the IP address even was?",00:20:36.670,00:20:42.030
"&gt;&gt; Well it turns out that somewhere
in here there are servers--",00:20:42.030,00:20:45.660
"and I'm going to draw it
fairly abstractly--",00:20:45.660,00:20:48.330
as a DNS server--,00:20:48.330,00:20:49.710
Domain Name System.,00:20:49.710,00:20:51.220
These are not routers.,00:20:51.220,00:20:51.960
"These are different types of servers
whose purpose in life is to translate",00:20:51.960,00:20:56.050
"host names, like www.mit.edu, to IP
addresses, like 1.2.3.4 So DNS servers",00:20:56.050,00:21:04.340
do exactly that.,00:21:04.340,00:21:05.240
"You can think of them as having a big
database, or really, like a big Excel",00:21:05.240,00:21:08.320
file with two columns.,00:21:08.320,00:21:09.750
"One is host names, one
is IP addresses.",00:21:09.750,00:21:12.120
"And they just convert one to the
other, in either direction.",00:21:12.120,00:21:15.020
"&gt;&gt; Now in reality, it's a little
more complex than that.",00:21:15.020,00:21:16.830
"But that's how my computer, my random
Mac or PC on this table here, knows",00:21:16.830,00:21:22.070
"what the unique identifier is for
www.mit.edu, or Facebook, or",00:21:22.070,00:21:27.590
"harvard.edu, for that matter.",00:21:27.590,00:21:29.680
"But of course, there's the entirety
of Mass Ave here.",00:21:29.680,00:21:33.520
"And then, we get to MIT, which this
is actually more compelling.",00:21:33.520,00:21:37.390
That'll be MIT.,00:21:37.390,00:21:39.230
"And so they, too, have some servers.",00:21:39.230,00:21:41.580
"And they somehow have a wired, or
wireless, connection to Harvard.",00:21:41.580,00:21:45.770
"And of course, we can go much farther
down the road than MIT, and talk to",00:21:45.770,00:21:48.830
most any computer in the world.,00:21:48.830,00:21:50.470
&gt;&gt; But let's see if we can't see that.,00:21:50.470,00:21:52.060
"Let me go back to my Terminal
window for just a moment.",00:21:52.060,00:21:54.810
"And let's assume that I figured out
what the IP address is for mit.edu",00:21:54.810,00:22:00.170
"like Telnet figured it out before,
and my browser can clearly",00:22:00.170,00:22:02.700
figure it out for me.,00:22:02.700,00:22:03.960
"And I'm going to run another program,
in this Terminal window, called",00:22:03.960,00:22:06.970
"traceroute, tracing the
route from here--",00:22:06.970,00:22:10.320
"literally, this table--
to www.mit.edu.",00:22:10.320,00:22:13.760
Let's see what happens.,00:22:13.760,00:22:14.750
Let me actually shrink the font size.,00:22:14.750,00:22:16.690
Oop.,00:22:16.690,00:22:17.430
"No, I wanted to surprise you.",00:22:17.430,00:22:18.790
&gt;&gt; OK.,00:22:18.790,00:22:19.110
So here we go.,00:22:19.110,00:22:20.870
Let me go ahead and run this here.,00:22:20.870,00:22:22.880
"And what I was seeing a moment ago, and
we're seeing again now, is this",00:22:22.880,00:22:26.410
output-- traceroute www.mit.edu.,00:22:26.410,00:22:29.980
"Notice, in the first line, this program
indeed figured out that MIT's",00:22:29.980,00:22:33.380
IP address is this number here.,00:22:33.380,00:22:35.730
"And now, what's going on
between us and them?",00:22:35.730,00:22:38.060
"&gt;&gt; So this line here, in row one, and this
line here, in row two, and then,",00:22:38.060,00:22:44.110
"row three-- what do each of these
lines probably represent?",00:22:44.110,00:22:46.335
"Locations, points, sure.",00:22:49.010,00:22:50.225
"They're called hops, conceptually.",00:22:50.225,00:22:53.520
"But physically, what are they?",00:22:53.520,00:22:56.230
They're routers.,00:22:56.230,00:22:57.130
"&gt;&gt; We only have, really, one piece of
hardware here to talk about thus far.",00:22:57.130,00:22:59.820
They're routers.,00:22:59.820,00:23:00.560
So this thing here--,00:23:00.560,00:23:01.800
crazy name--,00:23:01.800,00:23:02.990
"but this is probably machine room,
MR, in the Science Center.",00:23:02.990,00:23:06.700
"It's a gateway, aka router.",00:23:06.700,00:23:08.680
"This is just some unique number that
someone came up with for it.",00:23:08.680,00:23:11.160
And it's within harvard.edu.,00:23:11.160,00:23:13.120
"And that's the IP address of that router
that's, again, probably in the",00:23:13.120,00:23:16.290
"Science Center, based on its name.",00:23:16.290,00:23:17.860
"This second row represents another
router that doesn't have a nickname",00:23:17.860,00:23:21.440
"apparently-- a host name-- it
just has an IP address.",00:23:21.440,00:23:23.980
"&gt;&gt; So long story short, to get data from
points A to B, there's more than just",00:23:23.980,00:23:28.070
"Harvard's router, and MIT's router,
and Google's router,",00:23:28.070,00:23:31.400
and Facebook's router.,00:23:31.400,00:23:32.640
"There's dozens, hundreds, thousands of
routers between any point A and any",00:23:32.640,00:23:37.300
point B on the internet.,00:23:37.300,00:23:38.710
"But typically, you can get data
from one point to another in",00:23:38.710,00:23:41.710
fewer than 30 hops.,00:23:41.710,00:23:43.210
"In other words, you only have to hand
the data to 30 or fewer such routers.",00:23:43.210,00:23:47.930
"And it's typically many
fewer than that.",00:23:47.930,00:23:49.720
"&gt;&gt; Well, let's see what happens here.",00:23:49.720,00:23:50.970
"In row three, we hit a router called
core Science Center gateway",00:23:50.970,00:23:54.460
something or other.,00:23:54.460,00:23:56.580
"In row 4, we have border gateway--",00:23:56.580,00:23:58.970
these are just cryptic acronyms--,00:23:58.970,00:24:00.670
also within harvard.edu.,00:24:00.670,00:24:02.530
Here's another border gateway.,00:24:02.530,00:24:04.160
"And then, all of a sudden, whoa,
we seem to be in New York City.",00:24:04.160,00:24:09.070
"&gt;&gt; So it turns out-- and I'm in inferring
only from the host name.",00:24:09.070,00:24:12.030
This could be misleading.,00:24:12.030,00:24:12.970
It could be down the road.,00:24:12.970,00:24:13.830
It's tough to say--,00:24:13.830,00:24:15.030
"but this can be used as a revelation
that the shortest distance between two",00:24:15.030,00:24:21.960
"points on the internet is not
necessarily a straight line.",00:24:21.960,00:24:25.730
"If we think of shortest as the quickest
path, the least congested",00:24:25.730,00:24:29.380
"path, it is quite possible--
though we can't be sure--",00:24:29.380,00:24:32.070
"that the data is traveling a decent
distance between rows five and six.",00:24:32.070,00:24:37.090
"&gt;&gt; Now unfortunately MIT, or someone, got
a little self-defensive, and they've",00:24:37.090,00:24:42.000
started ignoring our requests.,00:24:42.000,00:24:43.700
"Those routers have been configured to
ignore requests of the form who are",00:24:43.700,00:24:47.380
"you, who are you, who are you.",00:24:47.380,00:24:48.900
"So let's see if we can't do this
with someone more cooperative.",00:24:48.900,00:24:51.650
"So Stanford has a nice tradition of
having a little more openness.",00:24:51.650,00:24:56.260
So let's see what happens here.,00:24:56.260,00:24:57.820
"&gt;&gt; Again, pretty cryptic.",00:24:57.820,00:24:59.080
"But we start, again, in the machine
room in the Science",00:24:59.080,00:25:01.040
"Center, in row one.",00:25:01.040,00:25:01.990
So that's good.,00:25:01.990,00:25:02.660
"Most of the servers did reply,
including Stanford.",00:25:02.660,00:25:05.240
"So notice we went from the machine room
in the Science Center, to some",00:25:05.240,00:25:07.940
"anonymous router elsewhere, to another
Science Center gateway, to a border",00:25:07.940,00:25:11.770
"gateway, and then, to something here--",00:25:11.770,00:25:13.970
nox.org.,00:25:13.970,00:25:14.620
"This is the Northern Crossroads, a very
popular peering point where lots",00:25:14.620,00:25:19.330
"of cables, lots of ISPs--",00:25:19.330,00:25:21.080
"internet service providers--
connect into.",00:25:21.080,00:25:23.220
Here's another nameless IP here.,00:25:23.220,00:25:25.470
Here's another such server.,00:25:25.470,00:25:27.530
&gt;&gt; But this is interesting.,00:25:27.530,00:25:29.910
"Where is the router in
row eight, probably?",00:25:29.910,00:25:33.750
"So it's probably in Washington, DC.",00:25:33.750,00:25:36.030
"And I can kind of corroborate
that hypothesis this time.",00:25:36.030,00:25:40.290
"Because how long did it take us to go
from the Science Center to this router",00:25:40.290,00:25:45.230
in row seven?,00:25:45.230,00:25:46.370
"Well, these milliseconds measurements
on the right hand side here are",00:25:46.370,00:25:49.820
estimates of that time.,00:25:49.820,00:25:51.960
"&gt;&gt; There are three of them because the
program, traceroute, tries every",00:25:51.960,00:25:54.610
"router three times, just so you can get
a visual average of the numbers.",00:25:54.610,00:25:58.010
"But it apparently takes six
milliseconds to get",00:25:58.010,00:26:00.230
to row seven's router.,00:26:00.230,00:26:01.840
"But how fast can, apparently, you
travel, if you are a bit, between",00:26:01.840,00:26:05.470
Boston and Washington DC?,00:26:05.470,00:26:09.520
"14 milliseconds is as long as it takes
for that instant message, for that",00:26:09.520,00:26:14.180
"email, for that web page request to
travel between here and Washington DC.",00:26:14.180,00:26:18.870
"&gt;&gt; If I go further, to router number 10,
what city am I apparently in now?",00:26:18.870,00:26:23.970
"So, Houston.",00:26:23.970,00:26:24.810
"And this is corroborated
by the jump in time.",00:26:24.810,00:26:27.350
It's really slow to get to Houston.,00:26:27.350,00:26:28.730
"It takes 47 milliseconds to get from
Boston to Houston in this case.",00:26:28.730,00:26:33.960
"And if we look further, LAX--",00:26:33.960,00:26:37.120
"looks like we're getting to Stanford
sort of this way, by going through LA.",00:26:37.120,00:26:41.430
But I'm inferring that from LAX.,00:26:41.430,00:26:43.170
"The geeks tend to use airport codes
for routers names here.",00:26:43.170,00:26:46.390
"And this is kind of consistent
with that assumption.",00:26:46.390,00:26:48.600
82 milliseconds.,00:26:48.600,00:26:50.260
"&gt;&gt; Then, we apparently go to another LAX,
another LA router and then, some",00:26:50.260,00:26:54.720
"nameless one, and then finally, a
cryptic name on Stanford's network, or",00:26:54.720,00:26:59.530
"close thereto, stanford.edu, is
90 milliseconds away, or 6",00:26:59.530,00:27:04.670
plus hours by plane.,00:27:04.670,00:27:06.170
"So this is how fast data travels
on the internet.",00:27:06.170,00:27:09.360
"And it's things we absolutely
take for granted these days.",00:27:09.360,00:27:11.410
"When you're having some Gchat with
someone, and the messages are just",00:27:11.410,00:27:13.950
"appearing, consider just how
fast that's happening.",00:27:13.950,00:27:16.940
"And visually, it's indeed happening
at that kind of rate.",00:27:16.940,00:27:21.540
"&gt;&gt; So between points one and 18,
in this case, there are",00:27:21.540,00:27:25.620
things besides routers.,00:27:25.620,00:27:26.890
"What are some machines on the internet
that can block traffic",00:27:26.890,00:27:30.140
from getting through?,00:27:30.140,00:27:31.610
&gt;&gt; STUDENT: Firewalls.,00:27:31.610,00:27:31.950
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: So, firewalls.",00:27:31.950,00:27:32.910
"And we have personal firewalls such
that your own Mac or PC can keep",00:27:32.910,00:27:36.260
traffic in or out.,00:27:36.260,00:27:37.540
Harvard has firewalls.,00:27:37.540,00:27:38.990
MIT presumably has firewalls.,00:27:38.990,00:27:40.820
"And Stanford does, as do all of the
internet service providers who own",00:27:40.820,00:27:44.400
"these routers in between points A and B.
But did you ever stop to consider,",00:27:44.400,00:27:49.260
"or care, how a firewall works.",00:27:49.260,00:27:52.710
"Well already, we have the basic building
blocks with which to engineer",00:27:52.710,00:27:56.380
that answer.,00:27:56.380,00:27:57.700
&gt;&gt; If you were a firewall--,00:27:57.700,00:27:59.090
"and let's suppose that you are somewhere
between point A and point B.",00:27:59.090,00:28:03.740
"A cable is coming into you,
and going out of you.",00:28:03.740,00:28:06.080
"So you have the technological ability
to look at all of the envelopes of",00:28:06.080,00:28:11.160
"information that are flowing between
you and the other person.",00:28:11.160,00:28:14.200
"In other words, those get messages I was
manually typing, you can think of",00:28:14.200,00:28:17.280
"them as writing a quick note to someone,
putting the IP address of the",00:28:17.280,00:28:21.060
"recipient, and the port number of the
recipient, on this envelope, then,",00:28:21.060,00:28:24.810
"writing your own IP address and your own
port number in the top left hand",00:28:24.810,00:28:28.520
corner like you would a letter.,00:28:28.520,00:28:30.230
"Then, you send it out wirelessly.",00:28:30.230,00:28:32.520
"And it somehow travels, through routers,
through wires, wirelessly,",00:28:32.520,00:28:37.130
down the road to MIT.,00:28:37.130,00:28:39.190
"&gt;&gt; So if you're a firewall, how do
you stop that from happening?",00:28:39.190,00:28:43.520
"What would you do if your next p
set was implement a firewall?",00:28:43.520,00:28:49.710
"How do I stop all Harvard people from
ever talking to MIT people again?",00:28:49.710,00:28:53.980
&gt;&gt; [? STUDENT: You ?] reverse the letter.,00:28:53.980,00:28:55.870
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: You what?,00:28:55.870,00:28:56.450
"&gt;&gt; [? STUDENT: Reverse ?]
the letter early.",00:28:56.450,00:28:58.140
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Reverse the letter--
what do you mean?",00:28:58.140,00:28:59.290
"&gt;&gt; [? STUDENT: Send ?] it
back to the sender.",00:28:59.290,00:29:01.130
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Send it back.,00:29:01.130,00:29:01.780
OK.,00:29:01.780,00:29:01.990
"So you could reject the virtual
envelope, sort of by doing return to",00:29:01.990,00:29:05.720
sender somehow.,00:29:05.720,00:29:06.660
"So sure, that's what
we want to achieve.",00:29:06.660,00:29:08.370
But let's dive a little deeper.,00:29:08.370,00:29:09.440
How do I do that?,00:29:09.440,00:29:10.460
"&gt;&gt; If the input to this problem-- if I'm
the firewall, and I'm effectively",00:29:10.460,00:29:13.950
"standing between points A and B, and
I am a middle man that gets to look",00:29:13.950,00:29:18.020
"inside of this envelope, and then decide
whether to send it back to",00:29:18.020,00:29:21.240
"Harvard or to allow it to continue, what
is it I, the firewall, am going",00:29:21.240,00:29:25.030
to want to look at?,00:29:25.030,00:29:26.280
&gt;&gt; I think I heard it here.,00:29:29.030,00:29:29.975
&gt;&gt; [? STUDENT: Where it's ?] coming from.,00:29:29.975,00:29:30.550
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Where it's coming from.,00:29:30.550,00:29:32.360
"So if the source IP address--
the little number up here--",00:29:32.360,00:29:36.410
"is an IP address belonging
to Harvard--",00:29:36.410,00:29:38.430
"and I can actually know that
with high probability.",00:29:38.430,00:29:40.220
"Most of Harvard's IP addresses start
with 140.247 dot something dot",00:29:40.220,00:29:45.540
"something, or 128.103 dot
something dot something.",00:29:45.540,00:29:48.810
"Harvard owns those chunks
of IP addresses.",00:29:48.810,00:29:51.450
"&gt;&gt; Well, if I see that IP addresses as the
sender, I can just send it back.",00:29:51.450,00:29:55.200
"In reality, the internet doesn't
bother wasting time",00:29:55.200,00:29:57.380
sending the bits back.,00:29:57.380,00:29:58.460
"It just literally drops the packet
by deleting it, effectively.",00:29:58.460,00:30:02.480
So what else could I look at though?,00:30:02.480,00:30:04.190
"Suppose that I want to let people at
Harvard visit mit.edu, and pull up",00:30:04.190,00:30:10.520
"websites, and watch videos
at MIT, and the like.",00:30:10.520,00:30:13.230
"But I don't want humans at Harvard
emailing anyone at MIT.",00:30:13.230,00:30:17.970
"How could I allow traffic from Harvard
to MIT, via the web, but disallow",00:30:17.970,00:30:23.810
something like an email?,00:30:23.810,00:30:24.700
&gt;&gt; [? STUDENT: The ?] port number.,00:30:24.700,00:30:25.840
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: A port number-- that's the
only other ingredient we have.",00:30:25.840,00:30:28.650
"We have IP address, which we just
leveraged, or we have port number,",00:30:28.650,00:30:31.880
"where 80, we said, uniquely
identifies web traffic.",00:30:31.880,00:30:34.870
"Now I wouldn't expect you to know this--
some of you might already know",00:30:34.870,00:30:37.430
from familiarity--,00:30:37.430,00:30:38.210
"what's a number that's used
for email, usually?",00:30:38.210,00:30:41.860
It's often 25.,00:30:41.860,00:30:43.080
"25 refers to SMTP, which is a mail
transfer protocol that you might have",00:30:43.080,00:30:48.520
"had to set up at some point, if you're
using Eudora, or Outlook, or",00:30:48.520,00:30:51.270
something like that.,00:30:51.270,00:30:52.120
It's just another number--,00:30:52.120,00:30:53.190
25.,00:30:53.190,00:30:54.100
"&gt;&gt; Telnet, which we were using
before, uses 23.",00:30:54.100,00:30:58.934
FTP--,00:30:58.934,00:30:59.770
"file transfer protocol, if you've ever
heard of that one-- uses 21.",00:30:59.770,00:31:03.750
"HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP,
which we'll come back to",00:31:03.750,00:31:07.430
"before long, uses 443.",00:31:07.430,00:31:10.130
"So the world has a whole bunch of
numbers that correlate packets--",00:31:10.130,00:31:14.240
"rather, correlate services
to those actual numbers.",00:31:14.240,00:31:17.760
So that's all a firewall is doing.,00:31:17.760,00:31:19.400
"It's taking a look inside this virtual
envelope, and then deciding yea or nay",00:31:19.400,00:31:23.330
"to forward along, based
on those ingredients.",00:31:23.330,00:31:26.230
"&gt;&gt; Now what could Harvard clearly do
to get past this firewall then?",00:31:26.230,00:31:29.720
"If you want to be able to send a message
to MIT but not be detected,",00:31:29.720,00:31:33.620
"well, you could spoof your IP address,
and just somehow be fancy enough, know",00:31:33.620,00:31:38.050
"how to write C code, and write your own
network program that changes the",00:31:38.050,00:31:41.400
firm address.,00:31:41.400,00:31:41.860
"The problem is you can absolutely send
data anonymously, but if you want to",00:31:41.860,00:31:45.820
"get any kind of reply, like see MIT's
homepage, obviously, this addresses",00:31:45.820,00:31:49.850
needs to be correct.,00:31:49.850,00:31:50.870
"Otherwise, you can say anything
you want, you're not going to",00:31:50.870,00:31:52.780
hear back from them.,00:31:52.780,00:31:53.930
"But these are just one of the kinds
of attacks that we can send.",00:31:53.930,00:31:57.130
"&gt;&gt; But it turns out when we send these
messages-- and let's do",00:31:57.130,00:31:59.240
an example of this.,00:31:59.240,00:32:00.485
"It turns out, if I have a message that
I want to send, it's not just sent in",00:32:00.485,00:32:04.020
one envelope.,00:32:04.020,00:32:04.920
"For efficiency's sake, especially when
the files you're requesting or the",00:32:04.920,00:32:08.760
"responses you're getting are
particularly large, what TCP/IP--",00:32:08.760,00:32:13.570
"Transmission Control Protocol / Internet
Protocol-- it's just a fancy",00:32:13.570,00:32:16.330
"way of saying what the networking
software and computers do-- is they",00:32:16.330,00:32:19.630
"take a message like this, and they
cut it up into fragments--",00:32:19.630,00:32:23.770
let's say four fragments.,00:32:23.770,00:32:25.540
"&gt;&gt; And if I now cut this up into here,
cut this up into here, what my",00:32:25.540,00:32:29.740
"computer is then going to do is it's
going to take one fragment and put it",00:32:29.740,00:32:34.270
in an envelope.,00:32:34.270,00:32:35.700
"All right, and let me get a--",00:32:39.130,00:32:41.100
let's see.,00:32:41.100,00:32:41.630
It's going to take one.,00:32:41.630,00:32:43.150
"It's going to take another envelope, and
it's going to put the second part",00:32:43.150,00:32:46.490
of this message in here.,00:32:46.490,00:32:49.530
All right.,00:32:49.530,00:32:51.370
"It's going to take the third
part, put it in here.",00:32:51.370,00:32:55.226
"Maybe next time we'll
just do two parts.",00:32:55.226,00:32:57.410
"And we'll take the fourth part,
and put it in here.",00:32:57.410,00:33:00.010
"&gt;&gt; And what, now, has to be written
on these envelopes--",00:33:00.010,00:33:02.140
"which we'll pretend to do, for time's
sake, and not actually write out.",00:33:02.140,00:33:04.700
"What needs to be written on each of
these four envelopes, with my message",00:33:04.700,00:33:07.760
to someone?,00:33:07.760,00:33:08.320
&gt;&gt; [? STUDENT: The ?] order.,00:33:08.320,00:33:09.290
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: So, the order.",00:33:09.290,00:33:10.270
"I need not only the IP address and the
port numbers, as we just discussed, I",00:33:10.270,00:33:13.740
"now need a sequence number of some sort
to say, this is packet one, this",00:33:13.740,00:33:17.606
"is two, this is three, this is four.",00:33:17.606,00:33:19.840
And this is actually useful.,00:33:19.840,00:33:20.980
"Because the internet, it turns out,
is actually pretty unreliable.",00:33:20.980,00:33:23.690
Routers can get congested.,00:33:23.690,00:33:26.080
Cables can get overwhelmed--,00:33:26.080,00:33:27.615
an oversimplification--,00:33:27.615,00:33:28.860
"but, with bits such that what routers
have to do is just drop packets.",00:33:28.860,00:33:32.650
"&gt;&gt; In other words, if the internet is just
really congested, you might get",00:33:32.650,00:33:35.540
three out of those four packets.,00:33:35.540,00:33:37.000
"But if you have a unique identifier on
each of them, you'll know that you're",00:33:37.000,00:33:40.000
missing packet number four of four.,00:33:40.000,00:33:42.510
"So you can ask the guy at the
other end to resend it.",00:33:42.510,00:33:45.310
"But assuming that doesn't happen,
let's see what might happen.",00:33:45.310,00:33:47.900
"&gt;&gt; So if I want to send a message to-- who
would like to receive my message",00:33:47.900,00:33:50.780
from the internet?,00:33:50.780,00:33:52.235
How about someone closer up front.,00:33:52.235,00:33:53.630
"Brian, is it?",00:33:53.630,00:33:55.490
All right.,00:33:55.490,00:33:56.430
You stay there.,00:33:56.430,00:33:57.280
I'm going to send it to you.,00:33:57.280,00:33:58.820
"And the thing about the internet
is that they might not even",00:33:58.820,00:34:01.100
follow the same path.,00:34:01.100,00:34:02.020
&gt;&gt; So here I go.,00:34:02.020,00:34:02.990
"I am sending a message,
fragment one of four.",00:34:02.990,00:34:06.470
Be a router.,00:34:06.470,00:34:06.940
Just let other people deal with it.,00:34:06.940,00:34:08.469
There you go.,00:34:08.469,00:34:10.310
"We'll give this to you, and
we'll give this to you.",00:34:10.310,00:34:12.790
And we'll see how quickly--,00:34:12.790,00:34:14.000
"how many milliseconds it takes
to get this message to Brian.",00:34:14.000,00:34:16.500
Everyone gets to participate today.,00:34:20.820,00:34:23.940
All right.,00:34:23.940,00:34:25.130
"Brian has one, and two.",00:34:25.130,00:34:27.130
If someone wants to be--,00:34:27.130,00:34:29.279
&gt;&gt; [? STUDENT: All four. ?],00:34:29.279,00:34:30.230
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: He has all four.,00:34:30.230,00:34:30.980
So no one chose to drop a packet.,00:34:30.980,00:34:32.480
That's cool.,00:34:32.480,00:34:32.900
That's fine.,00:34:32.900,00:34:33.330
So Brian now has all four.,00:34:33.330,00:34:34.380
"If you want to go ahead and
reassemble those for us.",00:34:34.380,00:34:36.219
"I know, we're pretending.",00:34:39.360,00:34:40.320
So for time's sake--,00:34:40.320,00:34:45.090
we have four.,00:34:45.090,00:34:45.929
"So, OK, open one of them.",00:34:45.929,00:34:48.909
OK.,00:34:48.909,00:34:49.360
"That's one fourth of
my message to you.",00:34:49.360,00:34:51.699
"Now, open the second.",00:34:51.699,00:34:52.949
"This may be funny, in the end,
only to me and Brian.",00:34:58.190,00:35:01.985
"All right, you've got two.",00:35:01.985,00:35:04.320
"&gt;&gt; So in the meantime, we physically did
this with the scissors, but all it",00:35:04.320,00:35:09.110
"takes to fragment these things in a
computer is just to send some of the",00:35:09.110,00:35:12.360
"bits in one packet, in one virtual
envelope, some of the bits in the",00:35:12.360,00:35:15.930
"other, some in another, and some in a
fourth, and then, let the computer",00:35:15.930,00:35:19.160
"decide, based on those numbers,
in what order you have",00:35:19.160,00:35:21.570
to concatenate them.,00:35:21.570,00:35:24.166
"And Brian's, maybe, the only
one that can see this.",00:35:24.166,00:35:26.270
"The message I sent to Brain-- because of
course, the internet is filled with",00:35:26.270,00:35:29.010
"these, is--",00:35:29.010,00:35:30.260
yes.,00:35:33.080,00:35:34.500
&gt;&gt; So that's the message.,00:35:34.500,00:35:35.330
And Brian can hang on to that now.,00:35:35.330,00:35:36.700
"So it took, obviously,
a while to do this.",00:35:36.700,00:35:38.640
"But that's what really happens,
like routing data through the",00:35:38.640,00:35:41.680
audience in this way.,00:35:41.680,00:35:43.290
"But there is, again, a number of points,
routers, firewalls, and other",00:35:43.290,00:35:47.320
"such things between points A and B. And
rather than just tell the story",00:35:47.320,00:35:50.700
"verbally, I thought I'd pull up this
video that some friends of ours, from",00:35:50.700,00:35:54.740
"Erikson, years back, actually

"This information travels down into your
own personal mail room, when Mr.",00:37:53.320,00:37:56.950

and sends it on its way.",00:37:56.950,00:38:01.805
&gt;&gt; Each packet is limited in its size.,00:38:01.805,00:38:03.790
"The mail room must decide how to divide
the information, and how to",00:38:03.790,00:38:08.010
package it.,00:38:08.010,00:38:09.170
"Now the package needs a label containing
important information such",00:38:09.170,00:38:13.390
"as sender's address, receiver's address,
and the type of packet it is.",00:38:13.390,00:38:19.492

out onto the internet, it also",00:38:34.940,00:38:38.680
"gets an address for the proxy server,

as we'll see later.,00:38:42.570,00:38:44.410

"The proxy is used by many companies as
sort of a middle man in order to",00:41:04.340,00:41:08.750

connection, and for",00:41:08.750,00:41:11.570
security reasons as well.,00:41:11.570,00:41:15.350
"As you can see, the packets
are all of various sizes,",00:41:15.350,00:41:19.420
depending upon their content.,00:41:19.420,00:41:21.770
"&gt;&gt; The proxy opens the packet and looks
for the web address, or URL.",00:41:37.960,00:41:45.110
"Depending upon whether the address is
acceptable, the packet is sent on to",00:41:45.110,00:41:49.500
the internet.,00:41:49.500,00:41:50.750
"&gt;&gt; There are, however, some addresses which
do not meet with the approval of",00:41:56.940,00:42:01.970

"that is to say, corporate or
management guidelines.",00:42:03.090,00:42:05.893
These are summarily dealt with.,00:42:09.100,00:42:13.710
We'll have none of that.,00:42:13.710,00:42:15.620

on the road again.",00:42:15.620,00:42:19.227
"&gt;&gt; Next up, the firewall.",00:42:29.950,00:42:32.313
"The corporate firewall
serves two purposes.",00:42:36.500,00:42:40.225
"It prevents some rather nasty things
from the internet from coming into the",00:42:40.225,00:42:44.350
"intranet, and it can also prevent
sensitive corporate information from",00:42:44.350,00:42:48.460
being sent out onto the internet.,00:42:48.460,00:42:53.380
"&gt;&gt; Once through the firewall, a router
picks up the packet and places it onto",00:42:53.380,00:42:57.340
"a much narrower road, or
bandwidth, as we say.",00:42:57.340,00:43:01.216
"Obviously, the road is not broad
enough to take them all.",00:43:01.216,00:43:06.830
"&gt;&gt; Now you might wonder what happens to all
those packets which don't make it",00:43:06.830,00:43:10.870
along the way.,00:43:10.870,00:43:11.950
"Well, when Mr. IP doesn't receive an
acknowledgement that a packet has been",00:43:11.950,00:43:16.540
"received in due time, he simply
sends a replacement packet.",00:43:16.540,00:43:22.940

of the internet, a spider web of",00:43:22.940,00:43:29.360

links between networks.",00:43:33.670,00:43:39.360

opportunities, plenty of things to",00:43:47.340,00:43:50.540
"explore, and places to go.",00:43:50.540,00:43:53.130

regulation, new ideas find fertile",00:43:53.130,00:43:57.620
"soil to push the envelope
of their possibilities.",00:43:57.620,00:44:01.530

certain dangers also lurk.",00:44:01.530,00:44:05.240
"You'll never know when you'll meet the
dreaded ping of death, a special",00:44:05.240,00:44:10.860
"version of a normal request ping which
some idiot thought up to mess up",00:44:10.860,00:44:15.610
unsuspecting hosts.,00:44:15.610,00:44:18.500
"&gt;&gt; The path our packets take may be via
satellite, telephone lines, wireless,",00:44:18.500,00:44:23.760
or even trans-oceanic cable.,00:44:23.760,00:44:25.650
"They don't always take the fastest,
or shortest, routes possible.",00:44:25.650,00:44:29.860
But they will get there eventually.,00:44:29.860,00:44:33.560
"Maybe that's why it's sometimes
called the world wide wait.",00:44:33.560,00:44:38.410
"But when everything is working smoothly,
you can circumvent the globe",00:44:38.410,00:44:42.710
"five times over at the drop
of a hat, literally--",00:44:42.710,00:44:47.110
"and all for the cost of
a local call, or less.",00:44:47.110,00:44:51.520
"&gt;&gt; Near the end of our destination,
we'll find another firewall.",00:44:51.520,00:44:55.260
"Depending upon your perspective as a
data packet, the firewall could be a",00:44:58.450,00:45:02.740
"bastion of security, or
a dreaded adversary.",00:45:02.740,00:45:06.930
"It all depends on which side you're
on and what your intentions are.",00:45:06.930,00:45:11.710
"&gt;&gt; The firewall is designed to
let in only those packets",00:45:11.710,00:45:15.590

ports are closed for business.",00:45:22.450,00:45:26.880

customs, while others",00:45:58.230,00:46:02.190
look just a bit dubious.,00:46:02.190,00:46:04.760
"&gt;&gt; The firewall officer is not easily
fooled, such as when this ping of",00:46:04.760,00:46:08.390
