"In this problem, Romeo and
Juliet are to meet up for a",00:00:00.260,00:00:03.330
"date, where Romeo arrives at
time x and Juliet at time y,",00:00:03.330,00:00:08.530
"where x and y are independent
exponential random variables,",00:00:08.530,00:00:12.490
with parameters lambda.,00:00:12.490,00:00:13.750
"And we're interested in knowing
the difference between",00:00:13.750,00:00:16.340
"the two times of arrivals,
we'll call it z,",00:00:16.340,00:00:19.450
written as x minus y.,00:00:19.450,00:00:21.940
"And we'll like to know what
the distribution of z is,",00:00:21.940,00:00:25.180
"expressed by the probability
density function, f of z.",00:00:25.180,00:00:29.400
"Now, we'll do so by using the
so-called convolution formula",00:00:29.400,00:00:32.430
that we learn in the lecture.,00:00:32.430,00:00:34.220
"Recall that if we have a random
variable w that is the",00:00:34.220,00:00:38.130
"sum of two independent random
variables, x plus y, now, if",00:00:38.130,00:00:44.160
"that's the case, we can write
the probability [INAUDIBLE]",00:00:44.160,00:00:47.400
"function, fw, [INAUDIBLE]",00:00:47.400,00:00:50.320
as the following integration--,00:00:50.320,00:00:52.360
"negative infinity to infinity
fx little x times f of y w",00:00:52.360,00:01:01.130
"minus x, integrated over x.",00:01:01.130,00:01:05.540
"And to use this expression to
calculate f of z, we need to",00:01:05.540,00:01:08.800
do a bit more work.,00:01:08.800,00:01:10.490
"Notice w is expressed as a sum
of two random variables,",00:01:10.490,00:01:14.170
"whereas z is expressed as the
subtraction of y from x.",00:01:14.170,00:01:19.120
But that's fairly easy to fix.,00:01:19.120,00:01:21.370
"Now, we can write z.",00:01:21.370,00:01:23.090
"Instead of a subtraction, write
it as addition of x plus",00:01:23.090,00:01:28.820
negative y.,00:01:28.820,00:01:30.250
"So in the expression of the
convolution formula, we'll",00:01:30.250,00:01:33.120
"simply replace y by negative
y, as it will",00:01:33.120,00:01:37.225
show on the next slide.,00:01:37.225,00:01:38.640
"Using the convolution formula,
we can write f of z little z",00:01:38.640,00:01:44.600
"as the integration of f of x
little x and f of negative y z",00:01:44.600,00:01:51.090
minus x dx.,00:01:51.090,00:01:54.210
"Now, we will use the fact that
f of negative y, evaluated z",00:01:54.210,00:01:58.900
"minus x, is simply equal to f
of y evaluated at x minus z.",00:01:58.900,00:02:05.450
"To see why this is true, let's
consider, let's say, a",00:02:05.450,00:02:08.530
"discreet random variable, y.",00:02:08.530,00:02:10.759
"And now, the probability that
negative y is equal to",00:02:10.759,00:02:15.830
"negative 1 is simply the same
as probability that",00:02:15.830,00:02:19.440
y is equal to 1.,00:02:19.440,00:02:21.400
"And the same is true for
probability density functions.",00:02:21.400,00:02:24.930
"With this fact in mind, we can
further write equality as the",00:02:24.930,00:02:28.590
"integration of x times
f of y x minus z dx.",00:02:28.590,00:02:38.900
We're now ready to compute.,00:02:38.900,00:02:40.120
"We'll first look at the case
where z is less than 0.",00:02:40.120,00:02:44.310
"On the right, I'm writing out
the distribution of an",00:02:44.310,00:02:46.490
"exponential random variable
with a parameter lambda.",00:02:46.490,00:02:49.710
"In this case, using the
integration above, we could",00:02:49.710,00:02:52.520
"write it as 0 to infinity,
lambda e to the negative",00:02:52.520,00:02:57.130
"lambda x times lambda e to the
negative lambda x minus z dx.",00:02:57.130,00:03:05.130
"Now, the reason we chose a
region to integrate from 0 to",00:03:05.130,00:03:08.530
"positive infinity is because
anywhere else, as we can",00:03:08.530,00:03:11.880
"verify from the expression of
fx right here, that the",00:03:11.880,00:03:15.910
"product of fx times
fy here is 0.",00:03:15.910,00:03:20.300
Follow this through.,00:03:20.300,00:03:21.560
We'll pull out the constant.,00:03:21.560,00:03:23.080
"Lambda e to the lambda z, the
integral from 0 to infinity,",00:03:23.080,00:03:28.430
"lambda e to the negative
2 lambda x dx.",00:03:28.430,00:03:34.660
"This will give us lambda e to
the lambda z minus 1/2 e to",00:03:34.660,00:03:41.610
"the negative 2 lambda x infinity
minus this expression",00:03:41.610,00:03:48.970
value at 0.,00:03:48.970,00:03:50.900
"And this will give us lamdba
over 2 e to the lambda z.",00:03:50.900,00:03:57.250
"So now, we have an expression
for f of z evaluated at little",00:03:57.250,00:04:02.640
"z when little z is
less than 0.",00:04:02.640,00:04:07.660
"Now that have the distribution
of f of z when z is less than",00:04:07.660,00:04:10.870
"0, we'd like to know what
happens when z is greater or",00:04:10.870,00:04:13.340
equal to 0.,00:04:13.340,00:04:14.620
"In principle, we can go through
the same procedure of",00:04:14.620,00:04:16.820
"integration and calculate
that value.",00:04:16.820,00:04:19.450
"But it turns out, there's
something much simpler.",00:04:19.450,00:04:22.250
"z is the difference between x
and y, at negative z, simply",00:04:22.250,00:04:27.470
"the difference between
y and x.",00:04:27.470,00:04:29.850
"Now, x and y are independent and
identically distributed.",00:04:29.850,00:04:33.710
"And therefore, x minus
y has the same",00:04:33.710,00:04:36.270
distribution as y minus x.,00:04:36.270,00:04:38.760
"So that tells us z and negative
z have the same",00:04:38.760,00:04:42.350
distribution.,00:04:42.350,00:04:43.300
"What that means is, is the
distribution of z now must be",00:04:43.300,00:04:46.650
symmetric around 0.,00:04:46.650,00:04:48.610
"In other words, if we know that
the shape of f of z below",00:04:48.610,00:04:53.530
"0 is something like that, then
the shape of it above 0 must",00:04:53.530,00:04:57.910
be symmetric.,00:04:57.910,00:04:59.190
So here's the origin.,00:04:59.190,00:05:01.570
"For example, if we were to
evaluate f of z at 1, well,",00:05:01.570,00:05:06.750
"this will be equal to the value
of f of z at negative 1.",00:05:06.750,00:05:12.140
"So this will equal to f
of z at negative 1.",00:05:12.140,00:05:16.880
"Well, with this information in
mind, we know that in general,",00:05:16.880,00:05:20.490
"f of z little z is equal to
f of z negative little z.",00:05:20.490,00:05:26.310
"So what this allows us to do is
to get all the information",00:05:26.310,00:05:30.750
"for z less than 0 and generalize
it to the case",00:05:30.750,00:05:35.290
"where z is greater
or equal to 0.",00:05:35.290,00:05:38.250
"In particular, by the symmetry
here, we can write, for the",00:05:38.250,00:05:42.150
"case z greater or equal to 0,
as lambda over 2 e to the",00:05:42.150,00:05:46.960
negative lambda z.,00:05:46.960,00:05:49.410
"So the negative sign comes
from the fact that the",00:05:49.410,00:05:52.350
"distribution of f of z is
symmetric around 0.",00:05:52.350,00:05:55.650
"And simply, we can go back
to the expression",00:05:55.650,00:05:58.080
here to get the value.,00:05:58.080,00:06:00.370
"And all in all, this implies
that f of z little z is equal",00:06:00.370,00:06:04.220
"to lambda over 2 e to
the negative lambda",00:06:04.220,00:06:07.780
absolute value of z.,00:06:07.780,00:06:09.820
This completes our problem.,00:06:09.820,00:06:11.070
