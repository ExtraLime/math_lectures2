"PROFESSOR: Particles
in quantum mechanics.",00:00:21.160,00:00:23.250
"In particular, the ones that are
identical and non-interacting.",00:00:23.250,00:00:27.470
"So basically, we were focusing
on a type of Hamiltonian",00:00:37.140,00:00:42.430
"for a system of N
particles, which",00:00:42.430,00:00:45.780
"could be written as the sum of
contributions that correspond",00:00:45.780,00:00:53.190
"respectively to particle
1, particle 2, particle N.",00:00:53.190,00:00:57.460
"So essentially, a sum of
terms that are all the same.",00:00:57.460,00:01:03.090
"And one-particle
terms is sufficient",00:01:03.090,00:01:06.960
"because we don't
have interactions.",00:01:06.960,00:01:10.290
"So if we look at one of
these H's-- so one of these",00:01:10.290,00:01:15.750
"one-particle Hamiltonians, we
said that we could find some",00:01:15.750,00:01:19.673
kind of basis for it.,00:01:19.673,00:01:21.950
"In particular, typically we
were interested in particles",00:01:21.950,00:01:25.270
in the box.,00:01:25.270,00:01:26.140
"We would label them
with some wave number k.",00:01:26.140,00:01:31.430
"And there was an associated
one-particle energy,",00:01:31.430,00:01:37.130
"which for the case of
one-particle in box",00:01:37.130,00:01:39.900
"was h bar squared
k squared over 2m.",00:01:39.900,00:01:44.270
"But in general, for the
one-particle system,",00:01:44.270,00:01:48.770
"we can think of a ladder of
possible values of energies.",00:01:48.770,00:01:54.330
"So there will be some
k1, k2, k3, et cetera.",00:01:54.330,00:02:00.815
"They may be distributed in any
particular way corresponding",00:02:05.590,00:02:08.830
to different energies.,00:02:08.830,00:02:10.389
"Basically, you
would have a number",00:02:10.389,00:02:12.760
"of possible states
for one particle.",00:02:12.760,00:02:15.600
"So for the case of the particle
in the box, the wave functions",00:02:15.600,00:02:27.730
"and coordinate space that we
had x, k were of the form e",00:02:27.730,00:02:32.335
"to the i k dot x divided
by square root of V.",00:02:32.335,00:02:37.020
"We allowed the energies where h
bar squared k squared over 2m.",00:02:37.020,00:02:45.220
"And this discretization
was because the values of k",00:02:45.220,00:02:50.520
"were multiples of 2 pi over
l with integers in the three",00:02:50.520,00:02:56.165
different directions.,00:02:56.165,00:02:57.380
"Assuming periodic
boundary conditions",00:02:57.380,00:02:59.550
"or appropriate discretization
for closed boundary conditions,",00:02:59.550,00:03:03.670
or whatever you have.,00:03:03.670,00:03:07.010
"So that's the
one-particle state.",00:03:07.010,00:03:11.290
"If the Hamiltonian
is of this form,",00:03:11.290,00:03:15.350
"it is clear that we can
multiply a bunch of these states",00:03:15.350,00:03:20.620
"and form another
eigenstate for HN.",00:03:20.620,00:03:25.800
"Those we were calling
product states.",00:03:25.800,00:03:27.805
"So you basically pick a
bunch of these k's and you",00:03:32.945,00:03:38.180
multiply them.,00:03:38.180,00:03:39.280
"So you have k1, k2, kN.",00:03:39.280,00:03:43.685
"And essentially, that
would correspond,",00:03:46.410,00:03:49.050
"let's say, in coordinate
representation",00:03:49.050,00:03:52.460
"to taking a bunch of x's and
the corresponding k's and having",00:03:52.460,00:03:57.910
"a wave function of the form e to
the i k alp-- sum over alpha k",00:03:57.910,00:04:03.500
"alpha x alpha, and then
divided by V to the N over 2.",00:04:03.500,00:04:09.290
"So in this procedure,
what did we do?",00:04:13.210,00:04:16.779
"We had a number of possibilities
for the one-particle state.",00:04:16.779,00:04:22.340
"And in order to, let's say,
make a two-particle state,",00:04:22.340,00:04:26.030
"we would pick two of
these k's and multiply",00:04:26.030,00:04:31.450
"the corresponding
wave functions.",00:04:31.450,00:04:33.900
"If you had three particles,
we could pick another one.",00:04:33.900,00:04:37.060
"If you had four particles,
we could potentially",00:04:37.060,00:04:39.710
"pick a second one
twice, et cetera.",00:04:39.710,00:04:43.050
"So in general,
basically we would",00:04:43.050,00:04:44.890
"put N of these crosses on
these one-particle states",00:04:44.890,00:04:48.900
that we've selected.,00:04:48.900,00:04:51.570
"Problem was that
this was not allowed",00:04:51.570,00:04:54.690
"by quantum mechanics
for identical particles.",00:04:54.690,00:04:58.730
"Because if we took one
of these wave functions",00:04:58.730,00:05:01.960
"and exchanged two of
the labels, x1 and x2,",00:05:01.960,00:05:05.800
"we could potentially get
a different wave function.",00:05:05.800,00:05:10.280
"And in quantum mechanics, we
said that the wave function",00:05:10.280,00:05:14.650
"has to be either symmetric or
anti-symmetric with respect",00:05:14.650,00:05:18.850
"to exchange of a
pair of particles.",00:05:18.850,00:05:21.940
"And also, whatever it implied
for repeating this exchange",00:05:21.940,00:05:27.040
"many times to look at all
possible permutations.",00:05:27.040,00:05:31.340
"So what we saw was that
product states are good",00:05:31.340,00:05:36.770
"as long as you
are thinking about",00:05:36.770,00:05:38.467
distinguishable particles.,00:05:38.467,00:05:39.550
"But if you have
identical particles,",00:05:44.950,00:05:53.710
"you had to appropriately
symmetrize or anti-symmetrize",00:05:53.710,00:05:57.810
these states.,00:05:57.810,00:06:00.060
"So what we ended up was
a wabe of, for example,",00:06:00.060,00:06:05.320
"symmetrizing things for
the case of fermions.",00:06:05.320,00:06:09.250
"So we could take a bunch
of these k-values again.",00:06:09.250,00:06:12.400
"And a fermionic, or
anti-symmetrized version,",00:06:15.360,00:06:21.020
"was then constructed by
summing over all permutations.",00:06:21.020,00:06:25.980
"And for N particle, there would
be N factorial permutations.",00:06:25.980,00:06:31.110
"Basically, doing a
permutation of all of these",00:06:31.110,00:06:34.320
"indices k1, k2, et cetera,
that we had selected for this.",00:06:34.320,00:06:40.200
"And for the case
of fermions, we had",00:06:40.200,00:06:43.670
"to multiply each
permutation with a sign that",00:06:43.670,00:06:49.720
"was plus for even permutations,
minus for odd permutations.",00:06:49.720,00:06:56.130
"And this would give
us N factorial terms.",00:06:56.130,00:06:59.970
"And the appropriate
normalization",00:06:59.970,00:07:03.780
"was 1 over square
root of N factorial.",00:07:03.780,00:07:08.490
"So this was for the
case of fermions.",00:07:08.490,00:07:12.030
And this was actually minus.,00:07:12.030,00:07:13.445
"I should have put
in a minus here.",00:07:13.445,00:07:15.410
"And this would have
been minus to the P.",00:07:15.410,00:07:21.220
"For the case of
bosons, we basically",00:07:21.220,00:07:29.530
"dispensed with this factor
of minus 1 to the P.",00:07:29.530,00:07:33.360
So we had a Pk.,00:07:33.360,00:07:35.145
"Now, the corresponding
normalization that we had here",00:07:39.400,00:07:44.480
was slightly different.,00:07:44.480,00:07:46.420
"The point was that
if we were doing",00:07:46.420,00:07:50.020
"this computation for
the case of fermions,",00:07:50.020,00:07:55.570
"we could not allow
a state where there",00:07:55.570,00:07:58.165
"is a double occupation of one
of the one-particle state.",00:07:58.165,00:08:02.030
"Under exchange of
the particles that",00:08:02.030,00:08:06.060
"would correspond
to these k-values,",00:08:06.060,00:08:08.470
"I would get the same state back,
but the exchange would give me",00:08:08.470,00:08:11.600
"a minus 1 and it
would give me 0.",00:08:11.600,00:08:14.250
"So the fermionic wave function
that I have constructed",00:08:14.250,00:08:17.370
"here, appropriately
anti-symmetrized,",00:08:17.370,00:08:19.840
"exists only as long as
there are no repeats.",00:08:19.840,00:08:24.060
"Whereas, for the case of bosons,
I could put 2 over same place.",00:08:24.060,00:08:29.680
"I could put 3 somewhere else,
any number that I liked,",00:08:29.680,00:08:34.820
"and there would be
no problem with this.",00:08:34.820,00:08:38.090
"Except that the normalization
would be more complicated.",00:08:38.090,00:08:41.780
"And we saw that
appropriate normalization",00:08:41.780,00:08:44.320
"was a product over
k nk factorial.",00:08:44.320,00:08:47.135
So this was for fermions.,00:08:50.580,00:08:55.380
This is for bosons.,00:08:57.970,00:08:58.820
"And the two I can
submerge into one formula",00:09:03.380,00:09:09.110
"by writing a symmetrized
or anti-symmetrized state,",00:09:09.110,00:09:16.890
"respectively indicated by eta,
where we have eta is minus 1",00:09:16.890,00:09:22.550
"for fermions and eta
is plus 1 for bosons,",00:09:22.550,00:09:27.750
"which is 1 over square
root of N factorial product",00:09:27.750,00:09:33.510
over k nk factorials.,00:09:33.510,00:09:37.100
"And then the sum over all
N factorial permutations.",00:09:37.100,00:09:42.360
"This phase factor for fermions
and nothing for bosons",00:09:42.360,00:09:49.360
"of the appropriately
permuted set of k's.",00:09:49.360,00:09:52.120
"And in this way
of noting things,",00:09:57.630,00:10:04.920
"I have to assign values nk which
are either 0 or 1 for fermions.",00:10:04.920,00:10:13.840
"Because as we said, multiple
occupations are not allowed.",00:10:13.840,00:10:19.370
"But there is no
restriction for bosons.",00:10:19.370,00:10:21.500
"Except of course, that
in this perspective,",00:10:28.040,00:10:33.830
"as I go along this k-axis,
I have 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 0,",00:10:33.830,00:10:40.607
0 for the occupations.,00:10:40.607,00:10:44.910
"Of course, what I
need to construct",00:10:44.910,00:10:47.060
"whether I am dealing
with bosons or fermions",00:10:47.060,00:10:50.040
"is that the sum over k nk is
the total number of particles",00:10:50.040,00:10:54.660
that I have.,00:10:54.660,00:10:55.490
"Now, the other thing to note
is that once I have given you",00:11:01.800,00:11:08.430
"a picture such as this in terms
of which one-particle states",00:11:08.430,00:11:13.700
"I want to look at, or which
set of occupation numbers",00:11:13.700,00:11:19.360
"I have nk, then
there is one and only",00:11:19.360,00:11:23.300
"one symmetrized or
anti-symmetrized state.",00:11:23.300,00:11:27.400
"So over here, I
could have permuted",00:11:27.400,00:11:30.730
"the k's in a number
of possible ways.",00:11:30.730,00:11:34.770
"But as a result
of symmetrization,",00:11:34.770,00:11:36.740
"anti-symmetrization,
various ways",00:11:36.740,00:11:39.940
"of permuting the
labels here ultimately",00:11:39.940,00:11:44.200
"come to the same set
of occupation numbers.",00:11:44.200,00:11:48.210
"So it is possible to actually
label the state rather than",00:11:48.210,00:11:54.900
by the set of k's.,00:11:54.900,00:11:57.530
By the set of nk's.,00:11:57.530,00:11:59.600
"It is kind of a more appropriate
way of representing the system.",00:11:59.600,00:12:04.085
"So that's essentially
the kinds of states",00:12:16.850,00:12:21.770
that we are going to be using.,00:12:21.770,00:12:24.320
"Again, in talking about
identical particles,",00:12:24.320,00:12:27.200
"which could be either
bosons or fermions.",00:12:27.200,00:12:31.650
"Let's take a step back,
remind you of something",00:12:31.650,00:12:35.970
"that we did before that
had only one particle.",00:12:35.970,00:12:41.020
"Because I will soon
go to many particles.",00:12:41.020,00:12:43.750
"But before that,
let's remind you",00:12:43.750,00:12:46.940
"what the one particle
in a box looked like.",00:12:46.940,00:12:52.510
"So indeed, in this case,
the single-particle states",00:12:52.510,00:12:57.180
"were the ones that
I told you before,",00:12:57.180,00:13:00.030
"2 pi over l some
set of integers.",00:13:00.030,00:13:03.360
"Epsilon k, that was h bar
squared k squared over 2m.",00:13:03.360,00:13:08.260
"If I want to calculate
the partition function",00:13:08.260,00:13:13.260
"for one particle in the box,
I have to do a trace of e",00:13:13.260,00:13:19.330
"to the minus beta
h for one particle.",00:13:19.330,00:13:24.185
"The trace I can very
easily calculate",00:13:24.185,00:13:26.820
"in the basis in which
this is diagonal.",00:13:26.820,00:13:30.340
"That's the basis
that is parameterized",00:13:30.340,00:13:32.330
by these k-values.,00:13:32.330,00:13:34.320
"So I do a sum over k of
e to the minus beta h",00:13:34.320,00:13:40.280
bar squared k squared over 2m.,00:13:40.280,00:13:42.305
"And then in the limit
of very large box,",00:13:45.040,00:13:47.940
"we saw that the sum
over k I can replace",00:13:47.940,00:13:50.880
"with V integral
over k 2 pi cubed.",00:13:50.880,00:13:55.700
"This was the density
of states in k.",00:13:55.700,00:13:59.040
"e to the minus beta h bar
squared k squared over 2m.",00:13:59.040,00:14:05.910
"And this was three
Gaussian integrals",00:14:05.910,00:14:09.820
"that gave us the usual formula
of V over lambda cubed, where",00:14:09.820,00:14:15.100
"lambda was this thermal
[INAUDIBLE] wavelength",00:14:15.100,00:14:18.830
h root 2 pi mk.,00:14:18.830,00:14:20.665
"But we said that the essence
of statistical mechanics",00:14:26.970,00:14:31.560
"is to tell you
about probabilities",00:14:31.560,00:14:34.120
"of various micro-states, various
positions of the particle",00:14:34.120,00:14:37.680
"in the box, which in
the quantum perspective",00:14:37.680,00:14:41.870
"is probability becomes
a density matrix.",00:14:41.870,00:14:45.210
"And we evaluated
this density matrix",00:14:45.210,00:14:48.560
"in the coordinate
representation.",00:14:48.560,00:14:49.986
"And in the coordinate
representation,",00:14:52.810,00:14:57.030
"essentially what
we had to do was",00:14:57.030,00:15:00.600
"to go into the basis in
which rho is diagonal.",00:15:00.600,00:15:07.360
So we had x prime k.,00:15:07.360,00:15:11.750
"In the k basis, the density
matrix is just this formula.",00:15:11.750,00:15:18.616
"It's the Boltzmann weight
appropriately normalized by Z1.",00:15:18.616,00:15:23.030
And then we go kx.,00:15:25.540,00:15:26.880
"And basically,
again replacing this",00:15:31.860,00:15:35.300
"with V integral d cubed k 2 pi
cubed e to the minus beta h bar",00:15:35.300,00:15:42.360
squared k squared over 2m.,00:15:42.360,00:15:45.510
"These two factors of xk and x
prime k gave us a factor of e",00:15:45.510,00:15:51.430
"to the kx, xk I have as
ik dot x prime minus x.",00:15:51.430,00:16:05.130
Completing the square.,00:16:05.130,00:16:07.070
"Actually, I had to divide by Z1.",00:16:07.070,00:16:11.140
"There is a factor of 1 over
V from the normalization",00:16:11.140,00:16:14.140
of these things.,00:16:14.140,00:16:16.400
"The two V's here cancel,
but Z1 is proportional to V.",00:16:16.400,00:16:21.380
"The lambda cubes
cancel and so what",00:16:21.380,00:16:23.510
"we have is 1 over
V e to the minus x",00:16:23.510,00:16:28.740
"minus x prime squared
pi over lambda squared.",00:16:28.740,00:16:33.730
"So basically, what
you have here is",00:16:37.730,00:16:41.340
"that we have a box
of volume V. There",00:16:41.340,00:16:47.040
"is a particle inside
at some location x.",00:16:47.040,00:16:50.135
"And the probability
to find it at location",00:16:53.860,00:16:56.450
"x is the diagonal
element of this entity.",00:16:56.450,00:17:00.000
"It's just 1 over
V. But this entity",00:17:00.000,00:17:03.400
"has off-diagonal elements
reflecting the fact",00:17:03.400,00:17:08.369
"that the best that you can do
to localize something in quantum",00:17:08.369,00:17:12.510
"mechanics is to make some
kind of a wave packet.",00:17:12.510,00:17:15.990
OK.,00:17:24.890,00:17:27.170
So this we did last time.,00:17:27.170,00:17:31.740
"What we want to do now is
to go from one particle",00:17:31.740,00:17:37.216
to the case of N particles.,00:17:37.216,00:17:40.570
"So rather than
having 1x prime, I",00:17:40.570,00:17:44.020
"will have a whole bunch of x
primes labeled 1 through N.",00:17:44.020,00:17:49.420
"And I want to calculate the N
particle density matrix that",00:17:49.420,00:17:55.660
"connects me from set of points
x to another set of points",00:17:55.660,00:18:03.440
x prime.,00:18:03.440,00:18:04.080
"So if you like in
the previous picture,",00:18:04.080,00:18:06.880
"this would have been
x1 and x1 prime,",00:18:06.880,00:18:11.160
"and then I now have x2 and x2
prime, x3 and x3 prime, xN and",00:18:11.160,00:18:19.160
xN prime.,00:18:19.160,00:18:20.500
"I have a bunch of
different coordinates",00:18:20.500,00:18:23.520
and I'd like to calculate that.,00:18:23.520,00:18:27.140
OK.,00:18:27.140,00:18:28.100
"Once more, we know that rho
is diagonal in the basis that",00:18:28.100,00:18:37.620
"is represented by
these occupations",00:18:37.620,00:18:40.710
of one-particle states.,00:18:40.710,00:18:44.430
"And so what I can
do is I can sum over",00:18:44.430,00:18:49.480
a whole bunch of plane waves.,00:18:49.480,00:18:52.360
"And I have to pick N factors
of k out of this list",00:18:52.360,00:18:58.240
"in order to make one of these
symmetrized or anti-symmetrized",00:18:58.240,00:19:02.580
wave functions.,00:19:02.580,00:19:04.740
"But then I have to
remember, as I said,",00:19:04.740,00:19:08.230
"that I should not over-count
distinct set of k-values",00:19:08.230,00:19:14.170
"because permutations
of these list of k's",00:19:14.170,00:19:17.690
"that I have over here,
because of symmetrization",00:19:17.690,00:19:20.750
"or anti-symmetrization,
will give me the same state.",00:19:20.750,00:19:24.140
"So I have to be
careful about that.",00:19:24.140,00:19:26.670
"Then, I go from x prime to k.",00:19:26.670,00:19:31.650
"Now, the density matrix
in the k-basis I know.",00:19:35.770,00:19:39.510
"It is simply e to the minus
beta, the energy which",00:19:39.510,00:19:43.110
"is sum over alpha h bar squared
k alpha squared over 2m.",00:19:43.110,00:19:48.610
"So I sum over the
list of k alphas",00:19:48.610,00:19:52.690
that appear in this series.,00:19:52.690,00:19:54.510
There will be n of them.,00:19:54.510,00:19:56.350
"I have to
appropriately normalize",00:19:56.350,00:19:58.360
"that by the N-particle partition
function, which we have yet",00:19:58.360,00:20:03.100
to calculate.,00:20:03.100,00:20:04.800
And then I go back from k to x.,00:20:04.800,00:20:09.780
"Now, let's do this.",00:20:17.245,00:20:20.230
"The first thing that
I mentioned last time",00:20:20.230,00:20:23.390
"is that I would,
in principle, like",00:20:23.390,00:20:26.430
"to sum over k1 going
over the entire list,",00:20:26.430,00:20:30.580
"k2 going the entire list, k3
going over the entire list.",00:20:30.580,00:20:34.570
"That is, I would like to make
the sum over k's unrestricted.",00:20:34.570,00:20:39.170
"But then I have to
take into account",00:20:42.100,00:20:45.170
the over-counting that I have.,00:20:45.170,00:20:48.260
"If I am looking at the case
where all of the k's are",00:20:48.260,00:20:51.490
"distinct-- they don't show
any double occupancy-- then",00:20:51.490,00:20:57.250
"I have over-counted by the
number of permutations.",00:20:57.250,00:21:00.160
"Because any permutation would
have given me the same number.",00:21:00.160,00:21:03.890
"So I have to divide by
the number of permutations",00:21:03.890,00:21:07.000
"to avoid the over-counting
due to symmetrization here.",00:21:07.000,00:21:12.710
"Now, when I have
something like this,",00:21:12.710,00:21:14.680
"which is a multiple occupancy,
I have overdone this division.",00:21:14.680,00:21:22.580
"I have to multiply
by this factor,",00:21:22.580,00:21:28.730
"and that's the correct number
of over-countings that I have.",00:21:28.730,00:21:36.850
"And as I said, this was a good
thing because the quantity",00:21:36.850,00:21:40.880
"that I had the hardest
time for, and comes",00:21:40.880,00:21:43.980
"in the normalizations
that occurs here,",00:21:43.980,00:21:47.020
"is this factor of 1
over nk factorial.",00:21:47.020,00:21:49.750
"Naturally, again,
all of these things",00:21:53.140,00:21:56.680
do depend on the symmetry.,00:21:56.680,00:21:58.670
"So I better make sure
I indicate the index.",00:21:58.670,00:22:03.240
"Whether I'm calculating this
density matrix for fermions",00:22:03.240,00:22:06.400
"or bosons, it is important.",00:22:06.400,00:22:09.070
"In either case-- well,
what I need to do",00:22:09.070,00:22:16.000
"is to do a summation over P
here for this one and P prime",00:22:16.000,00:22:23.960
here or P prime here and P here.,00:22:23.960,00:22:26.150
"It doesn't matter, there's
two sets of permutations",00:22:26.150,00:22:28.440
that I have to do.,00:22:28.440,00:22:30.580
"In each case, I have to
take care of this eta P,",00:22:30.580,00:22:36.240
eta P prime.,00:22:36.240,00:22:36.815
And then the normalization.,00:22:42.390,00:22:45.450
"So I divide by twice, or the
square of the square root.",00:22:45.450,00:22:50.040
"I get the N factorial
product over k nk factorial.",00:22:50.040,00:22:56.350
"And very nicely, the
over-counting factor",00:22:56.350,00:23:00.190
"here cancels the
normalization factor",00:23:00.190,00:23:03.580
that I would have had here.,00:23:03.580,00:23:06.660
So we got that.,00:23:06.660,00:23:08.820
"Now, what do we have?",00:23:08.820,00:23:11.280
"We have P prime permutation
of these objects going to x,",00:23:11.280,00:23:23.500
"and then we have
here P permutation",00:23:23.500,00:23:27.330
of these k numbers going to x.,00:23:27.330,00:23:31.346
"I guess the first
one I got wrong.",00:23:31.346,00:23:36.270
I start with x prime.,00:23:36.270,00:23:37.860
Go through P prime to k.,00:23:40.460,00:23:44.630
"And again, symmetries are
already taken into account.",00:23:44.630,00:23:50.810
I don't need to write that.,00:23:50.810,00:23:52.730
"And I have the factor
of e to the minus beta h",00:23:52.730,00:23:57.490
"bar squared sum over
alpha k alpha squared",00:23:57.490,00:24:01.670
over 2m divided by ZN.,00:24:01.670,00:24:04.540
"OK, so let's bring all of the
denominator factors out front.",00:24:09.940,00:24:14.880
I have a ZN.,00:24:14.880,00:24:17.170
I have an N factorial squared.,00:24:17.170,00:24:20.970
Two factors of N factorial.,00:24:20.970,00:24:24.620
"I have a sum over two sets of
permutations P and P prime.",00:24:24.620,00:24:31.620
"The product of the associated
phase factor of their parities,",00:24:34.350,00:24:44.480
"and then I have this
integration over k's.",00:24:44.480,00:24:48.830
"Now, unrestricted.",00:24:48.830,00:24:50.820
"Since it is unrestricted, I
can integrate independently",00:24:50.820,00:24:55.730
"over each one of the k's, or
sum over each one of them.",00:24:55.730,00:25:01.320
"When I sum, the sum
becomes the integral",00:25:01.320,00:25:04.000
"over d cubed k alpha divided
by 2 pi-- yeah, 2 pi cubed V.",00:25:04.000,00:25:12.700
"Basically, the density in
replacing the sum over k",00:25:12.700,00:25:16.820
"alpha with the
corresponding integration.",00:25:16.820,00:25:20.350
"So basically, this
set of factors",00:25:20.350,00:25:25.430
is what happened to that.,00:25:25.430,00:25:28.550
"OK, what do we have here?",00:25:34.240,00:25:37.210
"We have e to the i x--
well, let's be careful here.",00:25:37.210,00:25:47.680
"I have e to the i x prime alpha
acting on k of p prime alpha",00:25:47.680,00:26:02.130
"because I permuted
the k-label that",00:26:02.130,00:26:07.850
"went with, say, the alpha
component here with p prime.",00:26:07.850,00:26:15.580
"From here, I would
have minus because it's",00:26:15.580,00:26:18.350
the complex conjugate.,00:26:18.350,00:26:20.050
"I have x alpha k p alpha,
because I permuted this by k.",00:26:20.050,00:26:30.746
"I have one of these factors for
each V. With each one of them,",00:26:34.080,00:26:40.010
"there is a normalization
of square root of V.",00:26:40.010,00:26:43.900
"So the two of them together will
give me V. But that's only one",00:26:43.900,00:26:48.930
"of the N-particle So
there are N of them.",00:26:48.930,00:26:53.210
"So if I want, I can
extend this product",00:26:53.210,00:26:57.265
to also encompass this term.,00:26:57.265,00:26:59.660

also write here e to the minus",00:27:02.520,00:27:07.420
"beta h bar squared

"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] after
this-- is it quantity xk minus",00:27:18.682,00:27:23.040
[INAUDIBLE].,00:27:23.040,00:27:25.540
PROFESSOR: I forgot an a here.,00:27:25.540,00:27:27.200
What else did I miss out?,00:27:27.200,00:27:28.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] quantity.,00:27:31.433,00:27:32.724
PROFESSOR: So I forgot the i.,00:27:35.592,00:27:37.210
"OK, good?",00:27:39.890,00:27:41.340
So the V's cancel out.,00:27:41.340,00:27:44.848
"All right, so that's fine.",00:27:44.848,00:27:48.200
What do we have?,00:27:48.200,00:27:49.380
"We have 1 over ZN N
factorial squared.",00:27:49.380,00:27:57.530
"Two sets of permutations
summed over, p and p prime.",00:27:57.530,00:28:02.070
"Corresponding parities
eta p eta of p prime.",00:28:02.070,00:28:07.170
"And then, I have a product
of these integrations",00:28:07.170,00:28:13.300
"that I have to do that are
three-dimensional Gaussians",00:28:13.300,00:28:17.980
for each k alpha.,00:28:17.980,00:28:20.900
What do I get?,00:28:20.900,00:28:22.700
"Well, first of all,
if I didn't have this,",00:28:22.700,00:28:24.890
"if I just was doing
the integration of e",00:28:24.890,00:28:27.730
"to the minus beta h bar
squared k squared over 2m,",00:28:27.730,00:28:32.100
I did that already.,00:28:32.100,00:28:34.120
I get a 1 over lambda cubed.,00:28:34.120,00:28:36.720
"So basically, from each
one of them I will get a 1",00:28:36.720,00:28:39.760
over lambda cubed.,00:28:39.760,00:28:40.645
"But the integration is
shifted by this amount.",00:28:43.830,00:28:47.470
"Actually, I already did the
shifted integration here also",00:28:47.470,00:28:50.690
for one particle.,00:28:50.690,00:28:53.060
"So I get the corresponding
factor of e to the minus-- ah.",00:28:53.060,00:29:03.400
"I have to be a little
bit careful over here",00:29:03.400,00:29:07.590
"because what I am integrating
is over k alpha squared.",00:29:07.590,00:29:14.450
"Whereas, in the way that
I have the list over here,",00:29:14.450,00:29:18.910
"I have x prime
alpha and x alpha,",00:29:18.910,00:29:22.830
"but a different k
playing around with each.",00:29:22.830,00:29:27.450
What should I do?,00:29:27.450,00:29:28.360
"I really want this
integration over k",00:29:28.360,00:29:31.700
"alpha to look like
what I have over here.",00:29:31.700,00:29:36.620
"Well, as I sum over
all possibilities",00:29:36.620,00:29:39.680
"in each one of these terms, I
am bound to encounter k alpha.",00:29:39.680,00:29:44.680
"Essentially, I have permuted
all of the k's that I originally",00:29:44.680,00:29:49.690
had.,00:29:49.690,00:29:50.810
"So the k alpha has now been
sent to some other location.",00:29:50.810,00:29:55.340
"But as I sum over all possible
alpha, I will hit that.",00:29:55.340,00:30:00.170
"When I hit that, I will
find that the thing that",00:30:00.170,00:30:03.540
"was multiplying k alpha is the
inverse permutation of alpha.",00:30:03.540,00:30:15.030
"And the thing that was
multiplying k alpha here",00:30:15.030,00:30:18.880
is the inverse permutation of p.,00:30:18.880,00:30:23.390
"So then I can do the
integration over k alpha easily.",00:30:29.140,00:30:34.140
And so what do I have?,00:30:34.140,00:30:35.570
"I have x prime of
p prime inverse",00:30:35.570,00:30:39.510
"alpha-- the inverse
permutation-- minus x",00:30:39.510,00:30:43.780
"of p inverse alpha squared
pi over lambda squared.",00:30:43.780,00:30:49.180
"Now, this is still
inconvenient because I",00:31:04.610,00:31:09.190
"am summing over two N
factorial sets of permutations.",00:31:09.190,00:31:14.860
"And I expect that since
the sum only involves",00:31:14.860,00:31:19.070
"comparison of things that
are occurring N times,",00:31:19.070,00:31:24.610
"as I go over the list of N
factorial permutation squared,",00:31:24.610,00:31:29.690
"I will get the same
thing appearing twice.",00:31:29.690,00:31:33.240
"So it is very much like when we
are doing an integration over x",00:31:33.240,00:31:37.590
"and x prime, but
the function only",00:31:37.590,00:31:39.610
depends on x minus x prime.,00:31:39.610,00:31:41.370
We get a factor of volume.,00:31:41.370,00:31:43.470
"Here, it is easy to
see that one of these",00:31:43.470,00:31:47.250
"sums I can very easily do
because it is just repetition",00:31:47.250,00:31:54.470
"of all of the results
that I have previously.",00:31:54.470,00:31:57.390
"And there will be N
factorial such terms.",00:31:57.390,00:32:01.400
"So doing that, I can get rid
of one of the N factorials.",00:32:01.400,00:32:07.810
"And I will have only
one permutation left,",00:32:07.810,00:32:11.780
"Q. And what will appear here
would be the parity of this Q",00:32:11.780,00:32:19.150
"that is the combination,
or if you like,",00:32:19.150,00:32:21.520
"the relative of these
two permutations.",00:32:21.520,00:32:25.600
"And I have an
exponential of minus sum",00:32:25.600,00:32:32.680
"over alpha x alpha minus
x prime Q alpha squared",00:32:32.680,00:32:41.190
pi over lambda squared.,00:32:41.190,00:32:44.650
"And I think I forgot a factor
of lambda to the 3 [INAUDIBLE].",00:32:44.650,00:32:50.173
This factor of lambda 3.,00:32:55.103,00:32:57.075
"So this is actually
the final result.",00:33:03.510,00:33:05.970
"And let's see what
that precisely",00:33:14.480,00:33:21.090
means for two particles.,00:33:21.090,00:33:22.510
So let's look at two particles.,00:33:27.030,00:33:28.560
"So for two particle,s I will
have on one side coordinates",00:33:32.810,00:33:40.020
of 1 prime and 2 prime.,00:33:40.020,00:33:42.885
"On the right-hand side, I
have coordinates 1 and 2.",00:33:45.440,00:33:49.525
"And let's see what this
density matrix tells us.",00:33:54.210,00:33:57.702
"It tells us that to go from x1
prime x2 prime, a two particle",00:33:57.702,00:34:04.470
"density matrix connecting
to x1 x2 on the other side,",00:34:04.470,00:34:11.540
"I have 1 over the two-particle
partition function",00:34:11.540,00:34:15.670
that i haven't yet calculated.,00:34:15.670,00:34:18.560
Lambda to the sixth.,00:34:18.560,00:34:20.920
N factorial in this case is 2.,00:34:20.920,00:34:24.699
"And then for two things,
there are two permutations.",00:34:24.699,00:34:32.320
"So the identity
maps 1 to 1, 2 to 2.",00:34:32.320,00:34:37.710
"And therefore, what
I will get here",00:34:37.710,00:34:39.560
"would be exponential of minus
x1' minus x1 prime squared",00:34:39.560,00:34:47.144
"pi over lambda squared minus
x2 minus x2 prime squared pi",00:34:47.144,00:34:55.070
over lambda squared.,00:34:55.070,00:34:56.060
"So that's Q being
identity and identity",00:35:02.450,00:35:07.610
has essentially 0 parity.,00:35:07.610,00:35:10.470
It's an even permutation.,00:35:10.470,00:35:14.120
"The next thing is when
I exchange 1 and 2.",00:35:14.120,00:35:17.410
That would have odd parity.,00:35:17.410,00:35:19.650
"So I would get minus 1 for
fermions, plus for bosons.",00:35:19.650,00:35:23.570
"And what I would get here
is exponential of minus x1'",00:35:23.570,00:35:28.460
"minus x2 prime squared pi
over lambda squared minus x2",00:35:28.460,00:35:33.990
"minus x1 prime squared
pi over lambda squared.",00:35:33.990,00:35:37.650
"So essentially, one of
the terms-- the first term",00:35:43.950,00:35:49.020
"is just the square of what I
had before for one particle.",00:35:49.020,00:35:53.320
"I take the one-particle result,
going from 1 to 1 prime,",00:35:53.320,00:35:57.560
"going from 2 to 2 prime
and multiply them together.",00:35:57.560,00:36:02.310
"But then you say, I can't tell
apart 2 prime and 1 prime.",00:36:02.310,00:36:07.700
"Maybe the thing that
you are calling 1 prime",00:36:07.700,00:36:09.860
"is really 2 prime
and vice versa.",00:36:09.860,00:36:13.330
"So I have to allow
for the possibility",00:36:13.330,00:36:16.280
"that rather than
x1 prime here, I",00:36:16.280,00:36:18.430
"should put x2 prime and
the other way around.",00:36:18.430,00:36:23.080
"And this also corresponds
to a permutation",00:36:23.080,00:36:27.560
that is an exchange.,00:36:27.560,00:36:28.630
"It's an odd parity and will
give you something like that.",00:36:28.630,00:36:33.840
"Say OK, I have no
idea what that means.",00:36:33.840,00:36:38.780
"I'll tell you, OK, you were
happy when I put x prime and x",00:36:38.780,00:36:43.720
"here because that
was the probability",00:36:43.720,00:36:45.640
to find the particle somewhere.,00:36:45.640,00:36:48.790
"So let me look at
the diagonal term",00:36:48.790,00:36:50.800
"here, which is a probability.",00:36:50.800,00:36:52.650
"This should give
me the probability",00:36:57.720,00:36:59.520
"to find one particle
at position x1,",00:36:59.520,00:37:02.120
one particle at position x2.,00:37:02.120,00:37:03.650
"Because the particles
were non-interacting,",00:37:06.990,00:37:09.130
"one particle-- it
could be anywhere.",00:37:09.130,00:37:10.890
"I had the 1 over V.
Is it 1 over V squared",00:37:10.890,00:37:15.010
or something like that?,00:37:15.010,00:37:17.240
"Well, we find that
there is factor",00:37:17.240,00:37:19.350
"out front that we
haven't yet evaluated.",00:37:19.350,00:37:21.520
"It turns out that this
factor will give me a 1",00:37:21.520,00:37:24.460
over V squared.,00:37:24.460,00:37:27.070
"And if I set x1
prime to x1, x2 prime",00:37:27.070,00:37:31.650
"to x2, which is what I've done
here, this factor becomes 1.",00:37:31.650,00:37:36.800
"But then the other factor will
give me eta e to the minus 2",00:37:36.800,00:37:41.510
"pi over lambda squared
x1 minus x2 squared.",00:37:41.510,00:37:46.590
"So the physical probability
to find one particle-- or more",00:37:53.070,00:37:58.960
"correctly, a wave packet
here and a wave package there",00:37:58.960,00:38:05.240
is not 1 over V squared.,00:38:05.240,00:38:07.580
"It's some function of the
separation between these two",00:38:07.580,00:38:10.796
particles.,00:38:10.796,00:38:11.295
"So that separation
is contained here.",00:38:15.030,00:38:18.410
"If I really call that
separation to be r,",00:38:18.410,00:38:23.290
"this is an additional
weight that depends on r.",00:38:23.290,00:38:27.210
This is r squared.,00:38:27.210,00:38:30.650
"So you can think of this
as an interaction, which",00:38:30.650,00:38:38.410
"is because solely of
quantum statistics.",00:38:38.410,00:38:41.140
And what is this interaction?,00:38:44.880,00:38:47.310
"This interaction V of r
would be minus kT log of 1",00:38:47.310,00:38:56.600
"plus eta e to the minus 2 pi
r squared over lambda squared.",00:38:56.600,00:39:02.337
"I will plot out for you
what this V or r looks",00:39:07.110,00:39:11.670
"like as a function of how far
apart the centers of these two",00:39:11.670,00:39:16.730
wave packets are.,00:39:16.730,00:39:19.390
"You can see that the
result depends on eta.",00:39:19.390,00:39:23.240
"If eta is minus 1, which is
for the case of fermions,",00:39:23.240,00:39:27.850
this is 1 minus something.,00:39:27.850,00:39:30.330
"It's something that
is less than 1.",00:39:30.330,00:39:32.600
[INAUDIBLE] would be negative.,00:39:32.600,00:39:34.960
"So the whole potential would
be positive, or repulsive.",00:39:34.960,00:39:39.580
"At large distances, indeed it
would be exponentially going",00:39:39.580,00:39:44.210
"to 0 because I can expand
the log at large distances.",00:39:44.210,00:39:48.840
"So here I have a term
that is minus 2 pi",00:39:48.840,00:39:51.650
r squared over lambda squared.,00:39:51.650,00:39:55.620
"As I go towards r equals
to 0, actually things",00:39:55.620,00:40:00.440
"become very bad because r
goes to 0 I will get 1 minus 1",00:40:00.440,00:40:05.610
and the log will diverge.,00:40:05.610,00:40:07.310
"So basically, there is, if you
like, an effective potential",00:40:07.310,00:40:14.290
"that says you
can't put these two",00:40:14.290,00:40:15.950
fermions on top of each other.,00:40:15.950,00:40:19.460
"So there is a
statistical potential.",00:40:19.460,00:40:21.860
"So this is for eta
minus 1, or fermions.",00:40:21.860,00:40:26.670
"For the case of
bosons, eta plus 1.",00:40:30.430,00:40:34.490
"It is log of 1 plus
something, so it's",00:40:34.490,00:40:36.910
"a positive number
inside the log.",00:40:36.910,00:40:39.385
"The potential will
be attractive.",00:40:39.385,00:40:43.520
"And it will actually saturate
to a value of kT log 2",00:40:43.520,00:40:49.660
when r goes to 0.,00:40:49.660,00:40:51.360
"So this is again, eta of plus
1 for the case of bosons.",00:40:51.360,00:40:57.850
"So the one thing that this
formula does not have yet",00:41:38.320,00:41:42.840
"is the value for this
partition function ZN.",00:41:42.840,00:41:46.480
"It gives you the qualitative
behavior in either case.",00:41:46.480,00:41:50.590
And let's calculate what ZN is.,00:41:50.590,00:41:53.390
"Well, basically, that
would come from noting",00:41:53.390,00:41:56.320
"that the trace of
rho has to be 1.",00:41:56.320,00:42:00.000
"So ZN is trace of e
to the minus beta H.",00:42:00.000,00:42:12.050
"And essentially, I can take
this ZN to the other side",00:42:12.050,00:42:22.340
"and evaluate this as x
e to the minus beta H x.",00:42:22.340,00:42:35.110
"That is, I can calculate
the diagonal elements",00:42:35.110,00:42:44.770
"of this matrix that
I have calculated--",00:42:44.770,00:42:46.600
that I have over there.,00:42:46.600,00:42:48.830
"So there is an
overall factor of 1",00:42:48.830,00:42:52.260
"over lambda cubed to the power
of N. I have N factorial.",00:42:52.260,00:42:59.430
"And then I have a sum over
permutations Q eta of Q.",00:43:02.250,00:43:12.800
"The diagonal element
is obtained by putting",00:43:12.800,00:43:15.580
x prime to be the same as x.,00:43:15.580,00:43:18.610
"So I have exponential of minus
x-- sum over alpha x alpha",00:43:18.610,00:43:30.290
minus x of Q alpha.,00:43:30.290,00:43:33.130
"I set x prime to
be the same as x.",00:43:33.130,00:43:36.620
Squared.,00:43:36.620,00:43:37.560
"And then there's an overall
pi over lambda squared.",00:43:37.560,00:43:41.530
"And if I am taking the trace,
it means that I have to do",00:43:44.200,00:43:50.030
integration over all x's.,00:43:50.030,00:43:52.580
"So I'm evaluating this trace
in coordinate basis, which",00:44:03.640,00:44:08.560
"means that I should
put x and x prime to be",00:44:08.560,00:44:11.040
"the same for the
trace, and then I",00:44:11.040,00:44:13.560
"have to sum or integrate over
all possible values of x.",00:44:13.560,00:44:19.970
So let's do this.,00:44:19.970,00:44:21.190
"I have 1 over N factorial lambda
cubed raised to the power of N.",00:44:21.190,00:44:31.070
OK.,00:44:31.070,00:44:31.900
"Now I have to make
a choice because I",00:44:31.900,00:44:36.290
"have a whole bunch of terms
because of these permutations.",00:44:36.290,00:44:40.660
Let's do them one by one.,00:44:43.180,00:44:46.520
"Let's first do the case
where Q is identity.",00:44:46.520,00:44:51.120
"That is, I map
everybody to themselves.",00:44:51.120,00:44:55.530
"Actually, let me write down
the integrations first.",00:44:55.530,00:45:00.580
"I will do the integrations
over all pairs",00:45:00.580,00:45:06.330
"of coordinates of
these Gaussians.",00:45:06.330,00:45:10.780
"These Gaussians I will evaluate
for different permutations.",00:45:10.780,00:45:17.730
"Let's look at the case
where Q is identity.",00:45:17.730,00:45:22.160
"When Q is identity, essentially
I will put all of the x prime",00:45:22.160,00:45:27.540
to be the same as x.,00:45:27.540,00:45:29.040
"It is like what I did here
for two particles and I got 1.",00:45:29.040,00:45:33.600
"I do the same thing for
more than one particle.",00:45:33.600,00:45:36.960
I will still get 1.,00:45:36.960,00:45:38.210
"Then, I will do the same
thing that I did over here.",00:45:42.740,00:45:46.420
"Here, the next term that I
did was to exchange 1 and 2.",00:45:46.420,00:45:52.370
So this became x1 minus x2.,00:45:52.370,00:45:56.070
I'll do the same thing here.,00:45:56.070,00:45:58.330
"I look at the case
where Q corresponds",00:45:58.330,00:46:01.570
"to exchange of
particles 1 and 2.",00:46:01.570,00:46:05.340
"And then that will
give me a factor which",00:46:05.340,00:46:07.690
"is e to the minus pi over lambda
squared x1 minus x2 squared.",00:46:07.690,00:46:15.180
"There are two of these making
together 2 pi over lambda",00:46:15.180,00:46:19.110
"squared, which I hope
I had there, too.",00:46:19.110,00:46:21.340
"But then there was a whole bunch
of other terms that I can do.",00:46:25.420,00:46:29.030
"I can exchange,
let's say, 7 and 9.",00:46:29.030,00:46:35.360
"And then I will get
here 2 pi over lambda",00:46:35.360,00:46:38.720
squared x7 minus x9 squared.,00:46:38.720,00:46:43.340
"And there's a whole
bunch of such exchanges",00:46:43.340,00:46:46.230
"that I can make in
which I just switch",00:46:46.230,00:46:50.220
"between two particles
in this whole story.",00:46:50.220,00:46:55.950
"And clearly, the number of
exchanges that I can make",00:46:55.950,00:47:00.840
"is the number of pairs,
N N minus 1 over 2.",00:47:00.840,00:47:05.060
"Once I am done with
all of the exchanges,",00:47:08.830,00:47:12.750
"then I have to go to
the next thing that",00:47:12.750,00:47:14.780
"doesn't have an analog
here for two particles.",00:47:14.780,00:47:18.120
"But if I take three
particles, I can permute them",00:47:18.120,00:47:20.850
like a triangle.,00:47:20.850,00:47:22.980
"So presumably there
would be next set",00:47:22.980,00:47:25.770
"of terms, which is a permutation
that is like 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1.",00:47:25.770,00:47:32.190
"There's a bunch of things that
involve two permutations, four",00:47:32.190,00:47:36.830
"permutations, and so forth.",00:47:36.830,00:47:40.190
"So there is a whole
list of things",00:47:40.190,00:47:42.600
"that would go to here where
these two-particle exchanges",00:47:42.600,00:47:47.710
are the simplest class.,00:47:47.710,00:47:49.190
"Now, as we shall see,
there is a systematic way",00:47:52.970,00:47:57.590
"of looking at things where
the two-particle exchanges are",00:47:57.590,00:48:02.540
"the first correction
due to quantum effects.",00:48:02.540,00:48:05.570
"Three-particle exchanges would
be higher-order corrections.",00:48:05.570,00:48:09.300
"And we can systematically
do them in order.",00:48:09.300,00:48:14.880
"So let's see what happens if
we compare the case where there",00:48:14.880,00:48:19.685
"is no exchange and the case
where there is one exchange.",00:48:19.685,00:48:24.210
"When there is no
exchange, I am essentially",00:48:24.210,00:48:26.540
"integrating over each
position over the volume.",00:48:26.540,00:48:31.500
"So what I would get is V
raised to the power of N.",00:48:31.500,00:48:38.880
The next term?,00:48:38.880,00:48:41.880
"Well, I have to do
the integrations.",00:48:41.880,00:48:45.420
"The integrations over x3, x4,
x5, all the way to x to the N,",00:48:45.420,00:48:51.120
there is no factors.,00:48:51.120,00:48:52.270
"So they will give me factors
of V. And there are N minus 2",00:48:52.270,00:48:56.790
of them.,00:48:56.790,00:48:57.290
"And then I have to do the
integration over x1 and x2",00:49:01.060,00:49:04.600
"of this factor, but
it's only a function",00:49:04.600,00:49:08.840
of the relative coordinate.,00:49:08.840,00:49:10.690
"So there is one
other integration",00:49:10.690,00:49:12.650
"that I can trivially do, which
is the center of mass gives me",00:49:12.650,00:49:17.690
"a factor of V.
And then I am left",00:49:17.690,00:49:20.760
"with the integral over the
relative coordinate of e",00:49:20.760,00:49:24.973
"to the minus 2 pi r squared
over lambda squared.",00:49:24.973,00:49:30.170
"And I forgot-- it's
very important.",00:49:30.170,00:49:34.070
"This will carry a factor of eta
because any exchange is odd.",00:49:34.070,00:49:40.200
"And so there will be
a factor of eta here.",00:49:40.200,00:49:42.520
"And I said that I would
get the same expression",00:49:45.950,00:49:52.310
"for any of my N N minus
1 over 2 exchanges.",00:49:52.310,00:49:55.510
"So the result of all of
these exchange calculations",00:49:59.230,00:50:05.480
would be the same thing.,00:50:05.480,00:50:08.480
"And then there would
be the contribution",00:50:08.480,00:50:10.580
"from three-body
exchange and so forth.",00:50:10.580,00:50:12.520
So let's re-organize this.,00:50:19.460,00:50:21.950
"I can pull out the factor
of V to the N outside.",00:50:21.950,00:50:27.630
"So I would have V over lambda
cubed to the power of N.",00:50:27.630,00:50:32.620
So the first term is 1.,00:50:32.620,00:50:35.710
"The next term has
the parity factor",00:50:35.710,00:50:38.830
"that distinguishes
bosons and fermions, goes",00:50:38.830,00:50:42.460
"with a multiplicity of pairs
which is N N minus 1 over 2.",00:50:42.460,00:50:47.920
"Since I already pulled
out a factor of V to the N",00:50:47.920,00:50:51.230
"and I really had V to
the N minus 1 here,",00:50:51.230,00:50:54.440
"I better put a factor
of 1 over V here.",00:50:54.440,00:51:00.210
"And then I just am
left with having",00:51:00.210,00:51:02.420
"to evaluate these
Gaussian integrals.",00:51:02.420,00:51:06.420
"Each Gaussian
integral will give me",00:51:06.420,00:51:09.192
"2 pi times the
variance, which is",00:51:09.192,00:51:11.750
lambda squared divided by 2 pi.,00:51:11.750,00:51:16.620
"And then there's
actually a factor of 2.",00:51:16.620,00:51:21.040
"And there are three of
them, so I will have 3/2.",00:51:21.040,00:51:25.260
"So what I get here is lambda
cubed divided by 2 to the 3/2.",00:51:25.260,00:51:30.870
"Now, you can see that
any time I go further",00:51:39.580,00:51:43.690
"in this series of
exchanges, I will",00:51:43.690,00:51:47.240
"have more of these
Gaussian factors.",00:51:47.240,00:51:50.440
"And whenever I have
a Gaussian factor,",00:51:50.440,00:51:52.920
"I have an additional
integration to do",00:51:52.920,00:51:54.990
"that has an x minus
something squared in it.",00:51:54.990,00:51:57.770
"I will lose a factor of V. I
don't have that factor of V.",00:51:57.770,00:52:01.990
"And so subsequent terms will
be even smaller in powers of V.",00:52:01.990,00:52:07.470
"And presumably, compensated by
corresponding factors of lambda",00:52:07.470,00:52:12.240
squared-- lambda cubed.,00:52:12.240,00:52:13.550
"Now, first thing to note is
that in the very, very high",00:52:27.610,00:52:33.630
"temperature limit,
lambda goes to 0.",00:52:33.630,00:52:37.540
"So I can forget even
this correction.",00:52:37.540,00:52:40.680
What do I get?,00:52:40.680,00:52:42.170
"I get 1 over N factorial V over
lambda cubed to the power of N.",00:52:42.170,00:52:47.770
"Remember that many, many
lectures back we introduced",00:52:47.770,00:52:52.000
"by hand the factor of 1 over
N factorial for measuring",00:52:52.000,00:52:55.610
"phase spaces of
identical particles.",00:52:55.610,00:52:58.780
"And I promise to you
that we would get it",00:52:58.780,00:53:01.130
"when we did identical
particles in quantum mechanics,",00:53:01.130,00:53:03.880
so here it is.,00:53:03.880,00:53:05.940
"So automatically, we
did the calculation,",00:53:05.940,00:53:09.390
"keeping track of
identity of particles",00:53:09.390,00:53:12.030
at the level of quantum states.,00:53:12.030,00:53:14.300
"Went through the calculation and
in the high temperature limit,",00:53:14.300,00:53:17.400
"we get this 1 over N
factorial emerging.",00:53:17.400,00:53:22.410
"Secondly, we see that the
corrections to ideal gas",00:53:22.410,00:53:26.770
"behavior emerge as a series in
powers of lambda cubed over V.",00:53:26.770,00:53:34.470
"And for example, if I were to
take the log of the partition",00:53:34.470,00:53:40.120
"function, I would
get log of what",00:53:40.120,00:53:45.550
"I would have had classically,
which is this V over lambda",00:53:45.550,00:53:50.250
"cubed to the power of N
divided by N factorial.",00:53:50.250,00:53:53.770
"And then the log
of this expression.",00:53:57.110,00:54:01.750
"And this I'm going to
replace with N squared.",00:54:01.750,00:54:05.070
"There is not that
much difference.",00:54:05.070,00:54:07.720
"And since I'm regarding this
as a correction, log of 1",00:54:07.720,00:54:13.630
"plus something, I will
replace with the something",00:54:13.630,00:54:18.620
"eta N squared 2V lambda cubed
2 to the 3/2 plus higher order.",00:54:18.620,00:54:27.670
What does this mean?,00:54:30.580,00:54:32.170
"Once we have the
partition function,",00:54:32.170,00:54:34.130
we can calculate pressure.,00:54:34.130,00:54:36.740
"Reminding you that beta
p was the log Z by dV.",00:54:36.740,00:54:42.885
"The first part is
the ideal gas that we",00:54:45.615,00:54:49.850
had looked at classically.,00:54:49.850,00:54:52.040
"So once I go to the appropriate
large-end limit of this,",00:54:52.040,00:54:57.480
"what this gives me is
the density n over V.",00:54:57.480,00:55:03.330
"And then when I look
at the derivative here,",00:55:03.330,00:55:06.150
"the derivative of 1/V will give
me a minus 1 over V squared.",00:55:06.150,00:55:11.400
So I will get minus eta.,00:55:11.400,00:55:15.630
"N over V, the whole
thing squared.",00:55:15.630,00:55:18.500
"So I will have n squared
lambda cubed 2 to the 5/2,",00:55:18.500,00:55:25.180
and so forth.,00:55:25.180,00:55:26.600
"So I see that the
pressure of this ideal gas",00:55:30.730,00:55:35.600
"with no interactions
is already different",00:55:35.600,00:55:40.140
"from the classical result
that we had calculated",00:55:40.140,00:55:43.525
"by a factor that actually
reflects the statistics.",00:55:43.525,00:55:47.800
"For fermions eta of minus 1,
you get an additional pressure",00:55:47.800,00:55:52.660
"because of the kind of repulsion
that we have over here.",00:55:52.660,00:55:56.170
"Whereas, for bosons
you get an attraction.",00:55:56.170,00:55:59.640
"You can see that also the
thing that determines this--",00:55:59.640,00:56:02.740
"so basically, this
corresponds to a second Virial",00:56:02.740,00:56:06.420
"coefficient, which is minus
eta lambda cubed 2 to the 5/2,",00:56:06.420,00:56:16.830
"is the volume of
these wave packets.",00:56:16.830,00:56:23.820
"So essentially,
the corrections are",00:56:23.820,00:56:27.310
"of the order of n
lambda cubed that",00:56:27.310,00:56:32.720
"is within one of these wave
packets how many particles",00:56:32.720,00:56:37.750
you will encounter.,00:56:37.750,00:56:39.970
"As you go to high temperature,
the wave packets shrink.",00:56:39.970,00:56:43.780
"As you go to low temperature,
the wave packets expand.",00:56:43.780,00:56:48.550
"If you like, the interactions
become more important",00:56:48.550,00:56:52.010
"and you get corrections
to ideal gas wave.",00:56:52.010,00:56:55.147
"AUDIENCE: You assume that
we can use perturbation,",00:56:58.471,00:57:01.393
"but the higher terms actually
had a factor [INAUDIBLE].",00:57:01.393,00:57:05.289
"And you can't really use
perturbation in that.",00:57:09.185,00:57:13.110
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:57:13.110,00:57:14.570
"So what you are worried
about is the story here,",00:57:14.570,00:57:19.370
"that I took log of 1
plus something here",00:57:19.370,00:57:27.410
"and I'm interested in the
limit of n going to infinity,",00:57:27.410,00:57:31.700
"that finite density n over
V. So already in that limit,",00:57:31.700,00:57:36.530
"you would say that
this factor really",00:57:36.530,00:57:38.800
"is overwhelmingly
larger than that.",00:57:38.800,00:57:42.080
"And as you say, the next
factor will be even larger.",00:57:42.080,00:57:46.220
"So what is the justification
in all of this?",00:57:46.220,00:57:50.490
"We have already encountered
this same problem",00:57:50.490,00:57:54.990
"when we were doing
these perturbations",00:57:54.990,00:57:57.850
due to interactions.,00:57:57.850,00:57:59.710
"And the answer is that what
you really want to ensure",00:57:59.710,00:58:08.932
"is that not log Z,
but Z has a form",00:58:08.932,00:58:20.710
that is e to the N something.,00:58:20.710,00:58:23.245
"And that something
will have corrections,",00:58:25.985,00:58:28.375
"potentially that are powers
of N, the density, which",00:58:28.375,00:58:34.330
"is N over V. And if you try to
force it into a perturbation",00:58:34.330,00:58:39.490
"series such as this, naturally
things like this happen.",00:58:39.490,00:58:44.830
What does that really mean?,00:58:44.830,00:58:46.820
"That really means that the
correct thing that you should",00:58:46.820,00:58:51.630
"be expanding is,
indeed, log Z. If you",00:58:51.630,00:58:55.860
"were to do the kind of
hand-waving that I did here",00:58:55.860,00:58:59.350
"and do the expansion for Z, if
you also try to do it over here",00:58:59.350,00:59:03.950
"you will generate
terms that look",00:59:03.950,00:59:06.360
kind of at the wrong order.,00:59:06.360,00:59:08.780
"But higher order terms
that you would get",00:59:08.780,00:59:12.480
"would naturally conspire so
that when you evaluate log Z,",00:59:12.480,00:59:17.120
they come out right.,00:59:17.120,00:59:19.870
You have to do this correctly.,00:59:19.870,00:59:22.420
"And once you have
done it correctly,",00:59:22.420,00:59:24.120
"then you can rely
on the calculation",00:59:24.120,00:59:26.120
"that you did before
as an example.",00:59:26.120,00:59:28.430
"And we did it correctly when
we were doing these cluster",00:59:28.430,00:59:33.300
"expansions and the
corresponding calculation we",00:59:33.300,00:59:38.440
"did for Q. We saw how the
different diagrams were",00:59:38.440,00:59:41.500
"appearing in both
Q and the log Q,",00:59:41.500,00:59:44.400
"and how they could be
summed over in log Q.",00:59:44.400,00:59:47.910
"But indeed, this
mathematically looks awkward",00:59:47.910,00:59:51.485
"and I kind of jumped a
step in writing log of 1",00:59:51.485,00:59:55.250
"plus something that is huge
as if it was a small number.",00:59:55.250,01:00:00.492
All right.,01:00:14.550,01:00:17.300
So we have a problem.,01:00:17.300,01:00:20.870
"We want to calculate
the simplest",01:00:20.870,01:00:23.410
"system, which is the ideal gas.",01:00:23.410,01:00:26.940
"So classically, we did
all of our calculations",01:00:26.940,01:00:30.680
first for the ideal gas.,01:00:30.680,01:00:32.210
We had exact results.,01:00:32.210,01:00:34.030
"Then, let's say we
had interactions.",01:00:34.030,01:00:36.220
"We did perturbations around
that and all of that.",01:00:36.220,01:00:39.100
"And we saw that having to do
things for interacting systems",01:00:39.100,01:00:43.690
is very difficult.,01:00:43.690,01:00:46.540
"Now, when we start to do
calculations for the quantum",01:00:46.540,01:00:49.960
"problem, at least in the way
that I set it up for you,",01:00:49.960,01:00:53.810
"it seems that quantum
problems are inherently",01:00:53.810,01:00:57.250
interacting problems.,01:00:57.250,01:01:00.640
"I showed you that even at
the level of two particles,",01:01:00.640,01:01:03.850
"it is like having an interaction
between bosons and fermions.",01:01:03.850,01:01:08.820
"For three particles,
it becomes even worse",01:01:08.820,01:01:11.070
"because it's not only the
two-particle interaction.",01:01:11.070,01:01:14.890
"Because of the
three-particle exchanges,",01:01:14.890,01:01:16.920
"you would get an additional
three-particle interaction,",01:01:16.920,01:01:19.720
"four-particle interaction,
all of these things emerge.",01:01:19.720,01:01:24.020
"So really, if you
want to look at this",01:01:24.020,01:01:27.550
"from the perspective of
a partition function,",01:01:27.550,01:01:32.870
"we already see that
the exchange term",01:01:32.870,01:01:36.520
"involved having to
do a calculation that",01:01:36.520,01:01:38.800
"is equivalent to calculating
the second Virial",01:01:38.800,01:01:42.500
"coefficient for an
interacting system.",01:01:42.500,01:01:46.780
"The next one, for the
third Virial coefficient,",01:01:46.780,01:01:49.570
"I would need to look at
the three-body exchanges,",01:01:49.570,01:01:52.550
"kind of like the point
clusters, four-point clusters,",01:01:52.550,01:01:56.570
"all kinds of other
things are there.",01:01:56.570,01:01:59.510
So is there any hope?,01:01:59.510,01:02:00.410
"And the answer is that it is
all a matter of perspective.",01:02:05.150,01:02:11.300
"And somehow it is true
that these particles",01:02:11.300,01:02:22.560
"in quantum mechanics
because of the statistics",01:02:22.560,01:02:26.890
"are subject to all kinds of
complicated interactions.",01:02:26.890,01:02:31.310
"But also, the
underlying Hamiltonian",01:02:31.310,01:02:34.250
is simple and non-interacting.,01:02:34.250,01:02:37.000
"We can enumerate all
of the wave functions.",01:02:37.000,01:02:39.870
Everything is simple.,01:02:39.870,01:02:41.460
"So by looking at things
in the right basis,",01:02:41.460,01:02:44.770
"we should be able to calculate
everything that we need.",01:02:44.770,01:02:49.470
"So here, I was kind of looking
at calculating the partition",01:02:49.470,01:02:55.290
"function in the coordinate

"scenario because the Hamiltonian
is diagonal in the momentum",01:03:00.590,01:03:06.390
basis.,01:03:06.390,01:03:07.860
"So let's calculate ZN trace
of e to the minus beta H",01:03:07.860,01:03:16.690
"in the basis in
which H is diagonal.",01:03:16.690,01:03:19.630
"So what are the eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions?",01:03:23.860,01:03:28.240
"Well, the eigenfunctions are
the symmetrized/anti-symmetrized",01:03:28.240,01:03:32.890
quantities.,01:03:32.890,01:03:34.000
"The eigenvalues are simply
e to the minus beta H",01:03:34.000,01:03:37.170
"bar squared k alpha
squared over 2m.",01:03:37.170,01:03:40.890
"So this is basically
the thing that I",01:03:40.890,01:03:43.820
"could write as the set
of k's appropriately",01:03:43.820,01:03:47.690
"symmetrized or anti-symmetrized
e to the minus beta",01:03:47.690,01:03:52.370
"sum over alpha H bar squared
k alpha squared over 2m k eta.",01:03:52.370,01:04:00.060
"Actually, I'm going to-- rather
than go through this procedure",01:04:06.230,01:04:11.710
"that we have up there
in which I wrote",01:04:11.710,01:04:15.530
"these, what I need to do
here is a sum over all k",01:04:15.530,01:04:22.860
in order to evaluate the trace.,01:04:22.860,01:04:25.070
"So this is inherently a
sum over all sets of k's.",01:04:25.070,01:04:31.200
"But this sum is
restricted, just like what",01:04:31.200,01:04:35.180
I had indicated for you before.,01:04:35.180,01:04:38.790
"Rather than trying
to do it that way,",01:04:38.790,01:04:42.190
"I note that these
k's I could also",01:04:42.190,01:04:48.180
"write in terms of these
occupation numbers.",01:04:48.180,01:04:52.860
"So equivalently,
my basis would be",01:04:52.860,01:04:57.200
"the set of occupation
numbers times the energy.",01:04:57.200,01:05:04.370
"The energy is then e to the
minus beta sum over k epsilon k",01:05:04.370,01:05:13.400
"nk, where epsilon
k is this beta H",01:05:13.400,01:05:20.830
"bar squared k alpha
squared over 2m.",01:05:20.830,01:05:23.650
"But I could do this in
principle for any epsilon k",01:05:23.650,01:05:28.760
that I have over here.,01:05:28.760,01:05:30.800
"So the result that I am writing
for you is more general.",01:05:30.800,01:05:35.230
"Then I sandwich it
again, since I'm",01:05:35.230,01:05:37.120
"calculating the trace,
with the same state.",01:05:37.120,01:05:40.365
"Now, the states have
this restriction",01:05:43.360,01:05:46.900
that I have over there.,01:05:46.900,01:05:47.970
"That is, for the case of
fermions, my nk can be 0 or 1.",01:05:47.970,01:05:54.070
"But there is no restriction
for nk on the bosons.",01:05:54.070,01:05:58.440
"Except, of course, that there
is this overall restriction",01:05:58.440,01:06:03.360
"that the sum over
k nk has to be N",01:06:03.360,01:06:11.670
"because I am looking
at N-particle states.",01:06:11.670,01:06:14.865
"Actually, I can remove
this because in this basis,",01:06:22.810,01:06:29.610
"e to the minus
beta H is diagonal.",01:06:29.610,01:06:32.560
"So I can, basically,
remove these entities.",01:06:32.560,01:06:39.330
"And I'm just summing a
bunch of exponentials.",01:06:39.330,01:06:41.715
"So that is good because I
should be able to do for each nk",01:06:47.860,01:06:55.160
a sum of e to something nk.,01:06:55.160,01:06:57.580
"Well, the problem is this
that I can't sum over",01:07:00.410,01:07:03.150
each nk independently.,01:07:03.150,01:07:04.553
"Essentially in the picture
that I have over here,",01:07:08.990,01:07:14.660
I have some n1 here.,01:07:14.660,01:07:16.730
I have some n2 here.,01:07:16.730,01:07:18.870
"Some n3 here, which are
the occupation numbers",01:07:18.870,01:07:21.660
of these things.,01:07:21.660,01:07:24.260
"And for that
partition function, I",01:07:24.260,01:07:26.290
"have to do the sum of
these exponentials e",01:07:26.290,01:07:29.760
"to the minus epsilon 1 n1,
e to the minus epsilon 2 n2.",01:07:29.760,01:07:33.760
"But the sum of all of these
n's is kind of maxed out by N.",01:07:33.760,01:07:40.140
"I cannot independently sum
over them going over the entire",01:07:40.140,01:07:46.092
range.,01:07:46.092,01:07:47.740
"But we've seen previously
how those constraints can",01:07:47.740,01:07:52.745
"be removed in
statistical mechanics.",01:07:52.745,01:07:55.400
So our usual trick.,01:07:55.400,01:07:56.790
"We go to the ensemble in
which n can take any value.",01:07:56.790,01:08:01.910
"So we go to the grand
canonical prescription.",01:08:01.910,01:08:06.040
"We remove this constraint on n
by evaluating a grand partition",01:08:12.880,01:08:19.479
"function Q, which is a sum over
all N of e to the beta mu N ZN.",01:08:19.479,01:08:30.800
"So we do, essentially,
a Laplace transform.",01:08:30.800,01:08:34.240
"We exchange our n with
the chemical potential mu.",01:08:34.240,01:08:38.300
"Then, this constraint no
longer we need to worry about.",01:08:41.850,01:08:47.620
"So now I can sum over all
of the nk's without worrying",01:08:47.620,01:08:55.390
"about any constraint, provided
that I multiply with e",01:08:55.390,01:09:00.140
"to the beta mu n, which
is a sum over k nk.",01:09:00.140,01:09:03.560
"And then, the factor
that I have here,",01:09:07.770,01:09:10.660
"which is e to the minus beta
sum over k epsilon of k nk.",01:09:10.660,01:09:15.771
"So essentially for each
k, I can independently",01:09:22.180,01:09:28.319
"sum over its nk of e to the
beta mu minus epsilon of k nk.",01:09:28.319,01:09:38.359
"Now, the symmetry issues remain.",01:09:45.189,01:09:49.069
"This answer still
depends on whether or not",01:09:49.069,01:09:53.180
"I am calculating things
for bosons or fermions",01:09:53.180,01:09:57.870
"because these sums are
differently constrained",01:09:57.870,01:10:03.566
"whether I'm dealing
with fermions.",01:10:03.566,01:10:06.200
"In which case, nk
is only 0 or 1.",01:10:06.200,01:10:09.420
"Or bosons, in which case
there is no constraint.",01:10:09.420,01:10:12.075
So what do I get?,01:10:17.190,01:10:20.020
"For the case of fermions,
I have a Q minus,",01:10:20.020,01:10:28.540
which is product over all k.,01:10:28.540,01:10:33.020
"And for each k, the nk
takes either 0 or 1.",01:10:33.020,01:10:39.580
"So if it takes 0, I will
write e to the 0, which is 1.",01:10:39.580,01:10:45.500
Or it takes 1.,01:10:45.500,01:10:46.465
"It is e to the beta
mu minus epsilon of k.",01:10:46.465,01:10:50.562
"For the case of bosons,
I have a Q plus.",01:10:57.110,01:11:04.640
"Q plus is, again, a product
over Q. In this case,",01:11:04.640,01:11:10.370
"nk going from 0 to infinity, I
am summing a geometric series",01:11:10.370,01:11:15.240
"that starts as 1, and
then the subsequent terms",01:11:15.240,01:11:20.320
"are smaller by a factor of
beta mu minus epsilon of k.",01:11:20.320,01:11:26.950
"Actually, for future
reference note",01:11:26.950,01:11:31.260
"that I would be able to
do this geometric sum",01:11:31.260,01:11:35.350
"provided that this combination
beta mu minus epsilon of k",01:11:35.350,01:11:39.830
is negative.,01:11:39.830,01:11:41.130
"So that the subsequent terms
in this series are decaying.",01:11:41.130,01:11:44.570
"Typically, we would be
interested in things",01:11:51.890,01:11:54.680
"like partition functions,
grand partition functions.",01:11:54.680,01:11:58.660
"So we have something like log of
Q, which would be a sum over k.",01:11:58.660,01:12:05.620
"And I would have either
the log of this quantity",01:12:09.760,01:12:15.600
"or the log of this
quantity with a minus sign.",01:12:15.600,01:12:20.330
"I can combine the
two results together",01:12:20.330,01:12:23.180
"by putting a factor of minus
eta because in taking the log,",01:12:23.180,01:12:28.910
"over here for the bosons I
would pick a factor of minus 1",01:12:28.910,01:12:32.794
"because the thing is
in the denominator.",01:12:32.794,01:12:34.460
"And then I would
write the log of 1.",01:12:37.100,01:12:42.310
"And then I have in both
cases, a factor which",01:12:42.310,01:12:45.030
"is e to the beta mu
minus epsilon of k.",01:12:45.030,01:12:49.810
"But occurring with
different signs",01:12:49.810,01:12:52.050
"for the bosons and
fermions, which again I",01:12:52.050,01:12:54.850
"can combine into a single
expression by putting a minus",01:12:54.850,01:12:58.890
eta here.,01:12:58.890,01:13:01.920
"So this is a general
result for any Hamiltonian",01:13:01.920,01:13:10.890
"that has the characteristic
that we wrote over here.",01:13:10.890,01:13:14.210
"So this does not have to
be particles in a box.",01:13:14.210,01:13:16.960
"It could be particles in
a harmonic oscillator.",01:13:16.960,01:13:20.350
"These could be energy levels
of a harmonic oscillator.",01:13:20.350,01:13:23.750
"All you need to do is to
make the appropriate sum",01:13:23.750,01:13:27.470
"over the one-particle
levels harmonic oscillator,",01:13:27.470,01:13:30.520
"or whatever else you have,
of these factors that",01:13:30.520,01:13:34.010
"depend on the
individual energy levels",01:13:34.010,01:13:37.650
of the one-particle system.,01:13:37.650,01:13:39.120
"Now, one of the things
that we will encounter",01:13:50.720,01:13:52.790
"having made this transition
from canonical, where we knew",01:13:52.790,01:13:56.870
"how many particles we had, to
grand canonical, where we only",01:13:56.870,01:14:01.070
"know the chemical potential,
is that we would ultimately",01:14:01.070,01:14:04.510
"want to express things in terms
of the number of particles.",01:14:04.510,01:14:09.360
"So it makes sense to
calculate how many particles",01:14:09.360,01:14:16.070
"you have given that you have
fixed the chemical potential.",01:14:16.070,01:14:21.060
"So for that we
note the following.",01:14:21.060,01:14:42.985
"That essentially, we were able
to do this calculation for Q",01:14:45.560,01:14:55.410
"because it was a
product of contributions",01:14:55.410,01:14:58.580
"that we had for the individual
one-particle states.",01:14:58.580,01:15:04.560
"So clearly, as far as this
normalization is concerned,",01:15:04.560,01:15:10.510
"the individual one-particle
states are independent.",01:15:10.510,01:15:15.680
"And indeed, what we can say
is that in this ensemble,",01:15:15.680,01:15:20.752
"there is a classical probability
for a set of occupation numbers",01:15:20.752,01:15:27.610
"of one particle
states, which is simply",01:15:27.610,01:15:31.550
"a product over the different
one-particle states of e",01:15:31.550,01:15:37.960
"to the beta mu minus epsilon
k nk appropriately normalized.",01:15:37.960,01:15:49.830
"And again, the
restriction on n's",01:15:49.830,01:15:54.010
"being 0 or 1 for
fermions or anything",01:15:54.010,01:15:57.200
"for bosons would be
implicit in either case.",01:15:57.200,01:16:01.100
"But in either case, essentially
the occupation numbers",01:16:01.100,01:16:05.830
"are independently taken
from distributions",01:16:05.830,01:16:08.690
that I've discussed [INAUDIBLE].,01:16:08.690,01:16:11.810
"So you can, in
fact, independently",01:16:11.810,01:16:13.860
"calculate the average
occupation number",01:16:13.860,01:16:17.350
"that you have for each one of
these single-particle states.",01:16:17.350,01:16:22.460

get that by, for example,",01:16:22.460,01:16:29.790
"bringing down a
factor of nk here.",01:16:29.790,01:16:34.150
"And you can bring
down a factor of nk",01:16:34.150,01:16:37.190
"by taking a derivative of Q
with respect to beta epsilon k",01:16:37.190,01:16:44.170

"So you would have an
expression such as this.",01:16:50.632,01:16:53.350

k appears.,01:17:08.740,01:17:10.500

case of fermions,",01:17:10.500,01:17:12.890
"really there are
two possibilities.",01:17:12.890,01:17:14.890
n is either 0 or 1.,01:17:14.890,01:17:18.360
"So you would say that the
expectation value would",01:17:18.360,01:17:21.260
"be when it is 1, you have e to
the beta epsilon of k minus mu.",01:17:21.260,01:17:27.440
Oops.,01:17:27.440,01:17:28.370

"to the beta mu
minus epsilon of k.",01:17:36.910,01:17:40.450
"So when I look at
some particular state,",01:17:40.450,01:17:44.630
it is either empty.,01:17:44.630,01:17:46.030

"If I do the same thing
for the case of bosons,",01:17:57.650,01:18:01.460
"it is a bit more
complicated because I",01:18:01.460,01:18:04.400

on your calculations",01:18:19.430,01:18:22.750

and convince yourself",01:18:22.750,01:18:27.160

thing with a factor of minus",01:18:27.160,01:18:29.880
here.,01:18:29.880,01:18:30.380
"So this is fermions
and this is bosons.",01:18:34.850,01:18:40.798

two expressions together",01:18:45.480,01:18:52.000

factor in both of them",01:18:52.000,01:18:57.390
