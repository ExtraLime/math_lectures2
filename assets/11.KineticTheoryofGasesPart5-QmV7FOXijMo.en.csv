PROFESSOR: OK.,00:00:20.510,00:00:21.320
Let's start.,00:00:21.320,00:00:24.300
"So let's review what
we've been trying",00:00:24.300,00:00:26.460
to do in the past few lectures.,00:00:26.460,00:00:29.980
"It's to understand a typical
situation involving something",00:00:29.980,00:00:33.710
"like a gas, which,
let's say, initially",00:00:33.710,00:00:37.130
is in one half of the container.,00:00:37.130,00:00:39.770
"And then expands until it
occupies the entire container,",00:00:39.770,00:00:45.020
"going from one equilibrium state
to another equilibrium state.",00:00:45.020,00:00:49.070
"Question is, how
to describe this",00:00:49.070,00:00:52.570
"from the perspective of
microscopic degrees of freedom,",00:00:52.570,00:00:57.050
"getting the idea
that eventually you",00:00:57.050,00:00:59.130
"will come to some
form of equilibrium.",00:00:59.130,00:01:01.950
"And actually, more seriously,
quantifying the process",00:01:01.950,00:01:06.320
"and timescales by which the
gas comes to equilibrium.",00:01:06.320,00:01:11.040
"So the first stage was to
say that we will describe",00:01:11.040,00:01:15.560
"the process by looking at
the density, which describes",00:01:15.560,00:01:21.500
"the number of representative
examples of the system, whose",00:01:21.500,00:01:28.640
"collections of
coordinates and momenta",00:01:28.640,00:01:31.540
"occupy a particular point in
the 6N-dimensional phase space.",00:01:31.540,00:01:35.710
"So basically, this is a function
that depends on 6N coordinates.",00:01:35.710,00:01:42.210
"And of course, it changes
as a function of time.",00:01:42.210,00:01:45.300
"And we saw that,
basically, if we",00:01:45.300,00:01:48.340
"were to look at how
this set of points",00:01:48.340,00:01:53.980
"were streaming in
phase space, and this",00:01:53.980,00:01:58.400
"can be mathematically
represented",00:01:58.400,00:02:01.100
"by looking at the
direct time dependence",00:02:01.100,00:02:05.350
"and the implicit time
dependence of all",00:02:05.350,00:02:07.560
"of the coordinates captured
through the Poisson bracket.",00:02:07.560,00:02:12.010
"And the answer was that
it is a characteristic",00:02:14.740,00:02:17.950
"of the type of Hamiltonian
evolution equations,",00:02:17.950,00:02:24.710
"that the flow is such that
the phase space does not",00:02:24.710,00:02:27.590
change volume.,00:02:27.590,00:02:28.810
"And hence, this quantity is 0.",00:02:28.810,00:02:32.460
"We said, OK, all
of that is fine.",00:02:32.460,00:02:34.230
"But what does that tell me
about how this gas is expanding?",00:02:34.230,00:02:39.040
"So for that, we
said that we need",00:02:39.040,00:02:40.990
"to look at descriptions that
are more appropriate to thinking",00:02:40.990,00:02:45.590
"about the volume and
density of a gas expanding.",00:02:45.590,00:02:50.310
"And we really want
to capture that",00:02:50.310,00:02:52.770
"through the
one-particle density.",00:02:52.770,00:02:55.200
"But along the way, we
introduced s particle densities,",00:02:55.200,00:02:59.380
"normalized up to something,
to correspond to, essentially,",00:02:59.380,00:03:06.980
"integrating over all
of the coordinates",00:03:06.980,00:03:09.810
that we're not interested in.,00:03:09.810,00:03:12.190
"Say coordinates pertaining
to numbers s plus 1 to N,",00:03:12.190,00:03:19.270
"corresponding
6N-dimensional phase",00:03:19.270,00:03:21.850
"space and the entire [INAUDIBLE]
of this density or probability.",00:03:21.850,00:03:26.470
"Then the next stage was to
be more specific about what",00:03:29.450,00:03:35.460
"governs the evolution of
these gas particles, i.e.,",00:03:35.460,00:03:39.230
what is the Hamiltonian.,00:03:39.230,00:03:41.160
"And we said, let's focus on
an N particle Hamiltonian that",00:03:41.160,00:03:46.590
"is composed, by
necessity certainly,",00:03:46.590,00:03:50.570
"of one-body terms that
is the kinetic energy",00:03:50.570,00:03:53.740
"and the potential energy, the
latter describing the box,",00:03:53.740,00:03:58.320
for example.,00:03:58.320,00:03:59.880
"And we added a
two-particle interaction.",00:03:59.880,00:04:02.580
"qi minus qj, which, for
the sake of simplicity,",00:04:05.750,00:04:09.780
"let's imagine is
spherically symmetric--",00:04:09.780,00:04:14.280
"only depends on the relative
position of these particles.",00:04:14.280,00:04:18.790
"Then we say that if I
look at the evolution",00:04:18.790,00:04:22.019
"of this s particle
density, I start",00:04:22.019,00:04:25.490
"by writing an equation
that kind of looks",00:04:25.490,00:04:28.140
"like the full
Liouville equation.",00:04:28.140,00:04:31.910
"There is a Hamiltonian that
describes this set of particles",00:04:31.910,00:04:37.830
"interacting among themselves,
just replacing n by s.",00:04:37.830,00:04:42.820
"And so if these were the only
particles in the universe,",00:04:42.820,00:04:47.080
this is what I would get.,00:04:47.080,00:04:49.030
"Except that we know that
there are other particles.",00:04:49.030,00:04:52.900
"And since we have two-body
collisions possible,",00:04:52.900,00:04:56.940
"any one of the particles in the
set that I'm describing here,",00:04:56.940,00:05:00.880
"composed of s particles,
can potentially",00:05:00.880,00:05:03.790
"collide with a
particle from this set",00:05:03.790,00:05:08.450
that I don't want to include.,00:05:08.450,00:05:10.420
"And that will change the
volume of phase space.",00:05:10.420,00:05:13.900
"This incompressibility
condition was valid",00:05:13.900,00:05:17.290
"only if the entire thing of
the Hamiltonian was considered.",00:05:17.290,00:05:21.770
"Here, I'm only looking
at the partial subset.",00:05:21.770,00:05:25.060
"And so then what
did I have here?",00:05:25.060,00:05:27.040
"I had the force exerted
from particle s plus 1",00:05:27.040,00:05:31.870
"on particle n changing the
momentum of the particle n.",00:05:31.870,00:05:39.600
"But the likelihood
that this happens",00:05:39.600,00:05:42.680
"depends on finding the
other particle also.",00:05:42.680,00:05:50.010
"So I had this dependence on
the density that was s plus 1.",00:05:50.010,00:05:56.910
So this was the BBGKY hierarchy.,00:05:56.910,00:06:00.490
"Then we said, let's take a
look at the typical value",00:06:00.490,00:06:04.830
"of the terms that we
have in this equation.",00:06:04.830,00:06:08.050
"And for s that is larger
than 2, this Hamiltonian",00:06:08.050,00:06:15.640
"that pertains to
s particles will",00:06:15.640,00:06:18.270
"have a collision term
among the particles.",00:06:18.270,00:06:21.300
"And that collision term will
give you some typical inverse",00:06:21.300,00:06:25.130
"timescale here, which is
related to the collision time.",00:06:25.130,00:06:30.080
"Whereas on the right-hand
side, for this collision",00:06:30.080,00:06:34.320
"to take place, you have
to find another particle",00:06:34.320,00:06:39.430
"to interact with in the
range of interactions",00:06:39.430,00:06:42.670
that we indicated by d.,00:06:42.670,00:06:44.700
"And for density n,
this was smaller",00:06:44.700,00:06:48.450
"by a factor of nd
cubed for dilute gases.",00:06:48.450,00:06:53.850
"Therefore, the left-hand
side is much larger",00:06:53.850,00:06:56.680
than the right-hand side.,00:06:56.680,00:06:58.290
"And within particular
approximation,",00:06:58.290,00:07:01.250
"we said that we are going
to approximately set",00:07:01.250,00:07:04.500
this right-hand side to 0.,00:07:04.500,00:07:07.470
OK?,00:07:07.470,00:07:09.490
"Except that we couldn't
do this for the equation",00:07:09.490,00:07:12.730
"that pertained to s equals to
1, because for s equals to 1,",00:07:12.730,00:07:20.990
"I did not have the
analog of this term.",00:07:20.990,00:07:24.620
"If I were to write the precise
form of this Poisson bracket,",00:07:24.620,00:07:30.940
"I had the partial
derivative with respect",00:07:30.940,00:07:33.730
"to time, the momentum
divided by mass,",00:07:33.730,00:07:41.110
"which is the velocity driving
the change in coordinate.",00:07:41.110,00:07:45.460
"And the force that comes
from the external potential,",00:07:45.460,00:07:48.350
"let's call it f1, we
arrive in the change",00:07:48.350,00:07:51.490
"in momentum of the one-particle
density, which is a function--",00:07:51.490,00:08:03.360
"let's write it explicitly--
of p1, q1, and t.",00:08:03.360,00:08:10.410
"And on the other side,
I had the possibility",00:08:10.410,00:08:16.720
"to have a term such
as this that describes",00:08:16.720,00:08:22.100
"a collision with
a second particle.",00:08:22.100,00:08:25.280
"I have to look at all
possible second particles",00:08:25.280,00:08:27.840
that I can collide with.,00:08:27.840,00:08:30.750
"They could come with
all variety of momenta,",00:08:30.750,00:08:36.182
which we will indicate p2.,00:08:36.182,00:08:38.679
They can be all over the place.,00:08:38.679,00:08:41.049
"So I have integrations
over space.",00:08:41.049,00:08:43.600
"And then I have
a bunch of terms.",00:08:43.600,00:08:46.700
"So for this, we said, let's
take a slightly better look",00:08:46.700,00:08:53.440
"at the kind of collisions
that are implicitly described",00:08:53.440,00:08:59.400
"via the term that we
would have here as f2.",00:08:59.400,00:09:04.010
"And since the right-hand side
of f2 we set to 0, essentially,",00:09:04.010,00:09:07.890
"f2 really describes
the Newtonian evolution",00:09:07.890,00:09:11.260
"of two particles coming
together and having a collision.",00:09:11.260,00:09:14.580
"And this collision,
I can-- really,",00:09:17.530,00:09:21.160
"the way that I
have it over there",00:09:21.160,00:09:23.630
"is in what I would
call a lab frame.",00:09:23.630,00:09:27.510
"And the perspective
that we should have",00:09:27.510,00:09:30.010
"is that in this frame,
I have a particle that",00:09:30.010,00:09:33.850
"is coming with
momentum, let's say,",00:09:33.850,00:09:35.800
"p1, which is the one
that I have specified",00:09:35.800,00:09:41.920
"on the left-hand
side of the equation.",00:09:41.920,00:09:44.240
"That's the density
that I'm following",00:09:44.240,00:09:46.240
"in the channel
represented by p1.",00:09:46.240,00:09:49.260
"But then along comes a
particle with momentum p2.",00:09:49.260,00:09:55.660
"And there is some
place where they",00:09:55.660,00:09:59.340
"hit each other, after which
this one goes off with p1 prime.",00:09:59.340,00:10:04.880
"Actually, let me call
it p1 double prime.",00:10:04.880,00:10:07.970
"And this one goes off
with p2 double prime.",00:10:07.970,00:10:11.980
"Now, we will find it
useful to also look",00:10:14.810,00:10:17.470
"at the same thing in the
center of mass frame.",00:10:17.470,00:10:21.000
"Now, in the center of
mass frame-- oops--",00:10:30.480,00:10:34.120
"my particle p1 is coming
with a momentum that",00:10:34.120,00:10:44.050
"is shifted by the p
of center of mass,",00:10:44.050,00:10:50.930
"which is really
p1 plus p2 over 2.",00:10:50.930,00:10:53.360
So this is p1 minus p2 over 2.,00:10:53.360,00:10:56.720
"And my particle number two
comes with p2 minus center",00:10:56.720,00:11:01.180
"of mass, which is
p2 minus p1 over 2.",00:11:01.180,00:11:08.950
So they're minus each other.,00:11:08.950,00:11:10.280
"So in the center
of mass frame, they",00:11:10.280,00:11:11.780
"are basically coming to each
other along the same line.",00:11:11.780,00:11:16.270
"So we could define one of
the axes of coordinates",00:11:16.270,00:11:21.330
"as the distance along
which they are approaching.",00:11:21.330,00:11:24.280
"And let's say we put
the center of mass",00:11:24.280,00:11:26.720
"at the origin,
which means that I",00:11:26.720,00:11:30.690
"have two more
directions to work with.",00:11:30.690,00:11:33.740
"So essentially, the coordinates
of this second particle",00:11:33.740,00:11:39.660
"can be described
through a vector b,",00:11:39.660,00:11:48.230
"which we call the
impact parameter.",00:11:48.230,00:11:52.380
"And really, what
happens to the collision",00:11:52.380,00:11:55.290
"is classically determined by
how close they approach together",00:11:55.290,00:12:01.460
to make that.,00:12:01.460,00:12:03.580
"To quantify that, we really
need this impact vector.",00:12:03.580,00:12:06.650
"So b equals to 0, they are
coming at each other head on.",00:12:06.650,00:12:10.060
"For a different b, they
are coming at some angle.",00:12:10.060,00:12:14.730
"So really, I need
to put here a d2b.",00:12:14.730,00:12:18.560
"Now, once I have specified the
form of the interaction that",00:12:22.780,00:12:27.690
"is taking place when the
two things come together,",00:12:27.690,00:12:32.730
"then the process is
completely deterministic.",00:12:32.730,00:12:35.960
Particle number one will come.,00:12:35.960,00:12:38.670
"And after the location at
which you have the interaction,",00:12:38.670,00:12:43.960
"will go off with p1 double
prime minus center of mass.",00:12:43.960,00:12:52.610
"And particle number
two will come and get",00:12:52.610,00:12:56.210
"deflected to p2 prime minus--
or double prime minus p",00:12:56.210,00:13:01.865
center of mass.,00:13:01.865,00:13:03.650
OK?,00:13:03.650,00:13:04.150
"And again, it is important
to note that this parameter",00:13:07.800,00:13:13.760
"A is irrelevant to the
collision, in that once I have",00:13:13.760,00:13:19.560
"stated that before
collision, I have a momentum,",00:13:19.560,00:13:28.890
"say, p1 and p2.",00:13:28.890,00:13:32.530
"And this impact
parameter b is specified,",00:13:35.300,00:13:40.490
"then p1 double prime
is known completely",00:13:40.490,00:13:45.850
"as a function of p1, p2, and b.",00:13:45.850,00:13:48.810
"And p2 double prime
is known completely",00:13:48.810,00:13:52.600
"as a function of p1, p2, and b.",00:13:52.600,00:13:59.710
"And everything in that
sense is well-defined.",00:13:59.710,00:14:05.030
"So really, this parameter
A is not relevant.",00:14:05.030,00:14:10.320
"And it's really the
B that is important.",00:14:10.320,00:14:14.820
"But ultimately, we also need
to get these other terms,",00:14:14.820,00:14:19.260
"something that has the
appropriate dimensions",00:14:19.260,00:14:21.700
of inverse time.,00:14:21.700,00:14:23.550
"And if I have a density
of particles coming",00:14:23.550,00:14:27.500
"hitting a target, how
frequently they hit",00:14:27.500,00:14:32.520
"depends on the product
of the density as well",00:14:32.520,00:14:36.050
as the velocity.,00:14:36.050,00:14:37.810
"So really, I have to
add here a term that",00:14:37.810,00:14:41.070
"is related to the velocity
with which these things are",00:14:41.070,00:14:44.100
approaching each other.,00:14:44.100,00:14:45.630
"And so I can write it either
as v2 minus v1, or p2 minus 1",00:14:45.630,00:14:51.030
over m.,00:14:51.030,00:14:51.690
"So that's the other thing
that I have to look at.",00:14:54.690,00:14:59.940
"And then, essentially,
what we saw",00:14:59.940,00:15:07.510
"last time is that the
rest of the story-- if you",00:15:07.510,00:15:11.390
"sort of think of these
as billiard balls,",00:15:11.390,00:15:13.920
"so that the collision is
instantaneous and takes place",00:15:13.920,00:15:17.450
"at a well-specified
point, instantaneously,",00:15:17.450,00:15:20.690
"at some location, you're
going with some momentum,",00:15:20.690,00:15:23.910
"and then turn and go
with some other momentum.",00:15:23.910,00:15:27.110
"So the channel that was
carrying in momentum p1, which",00:15:27.110,00:15:31.430
"is the one that we are
interested in, suddenly",00:15:31.430,00:15:35.240
"gets depleted by an
amount that is related",00:15:35.240,00:15:39.766
"to the probability of having
simultaneously particles",00:15:39.766,00:15:44.880
of momenta p1 and p2.,00:15:44.880,00:15:49.580
"And the locations that I
have to specify here-- well,",00:15:53.580,00:15:59.460
"again, I'm really
following this channel.",00:15:59.460,00:16:03.360
"And in this channel,
I have specified q1.",00:16:03.360,00:16:07.790
"And suddenly, I see that
at the moment of collision,",00:16:07.790,00:16:12.110
"the momentum changes, if you are
thinking about billiard balls.",00:16:12.110,00:16:15.710
"So really, it is
at that location",00:16:15.710,00:16:18.050
"that I'm interested
for particle one.",00:16:18.050,00:16:20.720
"For particle two, I'm
interested at something",00:16:20.720,00:16:24.050
"that is, let's say, q1
plus, because it depends",00:16:24.050,00:16:27.580
"on the location of particle
two shifted from particle one",00:16:27.580,00:16:32.150
"by an amount that is
related by b and whatever",00:16:32.150,00:16:35.230
"this amount slightly
of A is that is related",00:16:35.230,00:16:38.190
"to the size of
your billiard ball.",00:16:38.190,00:16:41.531
OK?,00:16:41.531,00:16:42.030
"Now, we said that there is a
corresponding addition, which",00:16:46.910,00:16:52.550
"comes from the fact that it
is possible suddenly to not",00:16:52.550,00:16:58.580
"have a particle moving
along, say, this direction.",00:16:58.580,00:17:04.140
"And the collision of
these two particles",00:17:04.140,00:17:07.240
"created something
along that direction.",00:17:07.240,00:17:10.740
"So the same way
that probabilities",00:17:10.740,00:17:13.119
"can be subtracted
amongst some channels,",00:17:13.119,00:17:16.010
"they can be added to
channels, because collision",00:17:16.010,00:17:18.569
"of two particles
created something.",00:17:18.569,00:17:21.589
"And so I will indicate
that by p1 prime, p2 prime,",00:17:21.589,00:17:28.900
"again, coordinates in
t, something like this.",00:17:28.900,00:17:34.140
"So basically, I try to be a
little bit more careful here,",00:17:34.140,00:17:38.950
"not calling these
outgoing channels p prime,",00:17:38.950,00:17:43.200
but p double prime.,00:17:43.200,00:17:44.970
"Because really, if
I were to invert",00:17:44.970,00:17:47.860
"p1 double prime and
p2 double prime,",00:17:47.860,00:17:51.260
"I will generate things
that are going backward.",00:17:51.260,00:17:54.690
"So there's a couple of
sign issues involved.",00:17:54.690,00:17:58.320
"But essentially, there
is a similar function",00:17:58.320,00:18:02.220
"that relates p1
prime and p2 prime.",00:18:02.220,00:18:05.780
"It is, basically, you
have to search out",00:18:05.780,00:18:07.900
"momenta whose outcome
will create particles",00:18:07.900,00:18:13.390
"in the channels
prescribed by p1 and p2.",00:18:13.390,00:18:15.550
"So as we said, up
to here, we have",00:18:19.290,00:18:22.920
"done a variety of
approximations.",00:18:22.920,00:18:26.240
"They're kind of
physically reasonable.",00:18:26.240,00:18:30.130
"There is some difficulty
here in specifying",00:18:30.130,00:18:33.280
"if I want to be very accurate
where the locations of q1",00:18:33.280,00:18:38.680
"and q2 are within
this interaction size",00:18:38.680,00:18:43.440
d that I am looking at.,00:18:43.440,00:18:45.760
"And if I don't think about
billiard balls, where",00:18:45.760,00:18:48.870
"the interactions are not
quite instantaneous where",00:18:48.870,00:18:51.810
"you change momenta, but
particles that are deformable,",00:18:51.810,00:18:56.470
"there is also certainly
a certain amount of time",00:18:56.470,00:18:59.250
where the potential is acting.,00:18:59.250,00:19:01.710
"And so exactly what time
you are looking at here",00:19:01.710,00:19:05.530
"is also not appropriate--
is not completely, no.",00:19:05.530,00:19:09.413
"But if you sort of make all
of those things precise,",00:19:12.830,00:19:16.620
"then my statement is
that this equation still",00:19:16.620,00:19:20.430
"respects the reversibility
of the equations of motions",00:19:20.430,00:19:25.290
that we had initially.,00:19:25.290,00:19:27.550
"But at this stage, we
say, well, what can",00:19:27.550,00:19:30.110
I do with this equation?,00:19:30.110,00:19:31.950
"I really want to
solve an equation that",00:19:31.950,00:19:34.750
"involves f of p1, q1, and t.",00:19:34.750,00:19:40.320
"So the best that
I can do is, first",00:19:40.320,00:19:42.310
"of all, simplify all
of the arguments here",00:19:42.310,00:19:46.300
"to be more or less
at the same location.",00:19:46.300,00:19:48.330
"I don't want to think about
one particle being shifted",00:19:48.330,00:19:52.210
"by an amount that is related
by b plus something that",00:19:52.210,00:19:55.100
"is related to the interaction
potential size, et cetera.",00:19:55.100,00:20:00.390
"Let's sort of change our focus,
so that our picture size,",00:20:00.390,00:20:06.020
"essentially, is
something that is",00:20:06.020,00:20:07.790
"of the order of the
size of the interaction.",00:20:07.790,00:20:12.050
"And also, our
resolution in time is",00:20:12.050,00:20:14.910
"shifted, so that we don't
really ask about moments of time",00:20:14.910,00:20:19.630
"slightly before and
after collision,",00:20:19.630,00:20:21.770
"where the particle, let's say,
could be deformed or whatever.",00:20:21.770,00:20:26.480
"So having done that, we
make these approximations",00:20:26.480,00:20:30.180
"that, essentially,
all of these f2's,",00:20:30.180,00:20:33.780
"we are going to replace
as a product of f1's",00:20:33.780,00:20:37.910
"evaluated all at
the same location--",00:20:37.910,00:20:41.540
"the location that
is specified here,",00:20:41.540,00:20:44.600
"as well as the same time, the
time that is specified there.",00:20:44.600,00:20:48.950
So this becomes-- OK?,00:20:48.950,00:21:15.490
"So essentially, the
result of the collisions",00:21:15.490,00:21:20.120
"is described on the left-hand
side of our equation",00:21:20.120,00:21:27.790
"by a term that integrates over
all momenta and overall impact",00:21:27.790,00:21:34.740
"parameters of a bracket,
which is a product of two",00:21:34.740,00:21:39.840
one-particle densities.,00:21:39.840,00:21:42.100
"And just to simplify
notation, I will call this",00:21:42.100,00:21:46.080
"the collision term that
involves two factors of f1.",00:21:46.080,00:21:51.460
"So that's just a
shorthand for that.",00:21:51.460,00:21:54.780
Yes.,00:21:54.780,00:21:55.280
"AUDIENCE: Is that
process equivalent",00:21:55.280,00:21:57.516
"of a similar
molecule [INAUDIBLE]?",00:21:57.516,00:22:01.250
"PROFESSOR: That, if you
want to give it a name, yes.",00:22:01.250,00:22:03.600
"It's called the assumption
of molecular chaos.",00:22:03.600,00:22:05.670
"And physically, it
is the assumption",00:22:11.150,00:22:16.480
"that the probability to
find the two particles",00:22:16.480,00:22:20.200
"is the product of
one-particle probabilities.",00:22:20.200,00:22:23.500
"And again, we say
that you have to worry",00:22:23.500,00:22:27.110
"about the accuracy
of that if you",00:22:27.110,00:22:30.460
"want to focus on sizes that are
smaller than the interaction",00:22:30.460,00:22:34.530
parameter size.,00:22:34.530,00:22:36.010
"But we change that as
part of our resolution.",00:22:36.010,00:22:38.500
"So we don't worry
about that aspect.",00:22:38.500,00:22:41.073
"AUDIENCE: So molecular
chaos doesn't",00:22:41.073,00:22:44.572
include eliminating this space?,00:22:44.572,00:22:49.009
It's a separate thing.,00:22:49.009,00:22:50.488
"PROFESSOR: I've only seen the
word ""molecular chaos"" applied",00:22:53.848,00:23:00.090
in this context.,00:23:00.090,00:23:01.710
"I think you are
asking whether or not",00:23:01.710,00:23:04.440
if q1 and q2 are different.,00:23:04.440,00:23:07.490
"I can replace that and
call that molecular chaos.",00:23:07.490,00:23:11.060
"I would say that that's
actually a correct statement.",00:23:11.060,00:23:14.680
It's not an assumption.,00:23:14.680,00:23:16.760
"Basically, when
the two particles",00:23:16.760,00:23:18.730
"are away from each other
to a good approximation,",00:23:18.730,00:23:22.640
"they don't really know
about-- well, actually,",00:23:22.640,00:23:25.910
"what I am saying is if I
really want to sort of focus",00:23:25.910,00:23:29.370
"on time dependence, maybe
that is also an assumption.",00:23:29.370,00:23:32.305
Yes.,00:23:32.305,00:23:33.730
"So they're really, if you
like, indeed, two parts.",00:23:33.730,00:23:38.290
"It is the replacing of f2
with the product of two",00:23:38.290,00:23:42.230
"f2's, and then evaluating
them at the same point.",00:23:42.230,00:23:48.010
Yes.,00:23:48.010,00:23:48.510
"AUDIENCE: But based on
your first line-- I mean,",00:23:48.510,00:23:50.690
"you could break that assumption
of different distribution",00:23:50.690,00:23:55.140
"functions have different events
that occur when they get close,",00:23:55.140,00:23:58.254
"and the framework
still works, right?",00:23:58.254,00:23:59.795
"It would just become-- when you
got down to the bottom line,",00:23:59.795,00:24:03.090
"it would just become a much
larger equation, right?",00:24:03.090,00:24:06.900
PROFESSOR: I don't understand.,00:24:06.900,00:24:08.150
"AUDIENCE: Like if you assume
different interactions.",00:24:08.150,00:24:10.316

interactions are here",00:24:12.810,00:24:16.640
"in how p1 prime and p2
prime depend on p1 and p2.",00:24:16.640,00:24:20.160
AUDIENCE: Right.,00:24:20.160,00:24:21.146
"What I'm suggesting
is if you change H",00:24:21.146,00:24:23.653
by keeping the top [INAUDIBLE].,00:24:23.653,00:24:26.650
"That's a pretty simple
H. Would this framework",00:24:26.650,00:24:29.340
"work for a more complicated H.
But then your bottom two lines",00:24:29.340,00:24:32.799
would become [INAUDIBLE].,00:24:32.799,00:24:33.840
"PROFESSOR: What
more can I do here?",00:24:33.840,00:24:36.820
"How can I make
this more general?",00:24:36.820,00:24:38.225
"Are you thinking
about adding it?",00:24:38.225,00:24:39.600
"AUDIENCE: No, no, no.",00:24:39.600,00:24:40.503
"I'm not suggesting you
make it more general.",00:24:40.503,00:24:42.336
"I'm suggesting you make
it more specific to break",00:24:42.336,00:24:44.590
"that assumption of
molecular chaos.",00:24:44.590,00:24:49.130
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:24:49.130,00:24:50.150
"So how should I modify
if I'm not saying--",00:24:50.150,00:24:52.850
"AUDIENCE: I didn't
have something in mind.",00:24:52.850,00:24:55.174
"I was just suggesting
[INAUDIBLE].",00:24:55.174,00:24:57.058
"PROFESSOR: Well, that's
where I have problem,",00:24:57.058,00:24:59.540
"because it seems to me
that this is very general.",00:24:59.540,00:25:02.930
"The only thing that I
left out is the body",00:25:02.930,00:25:05.890
"interactions may be having to
do with this being spherically",00:25:05.890,00:25:10.400
symmetric.,00:25:10.400,00:25:11.450
"But apart from that, this
is basically as general",00:25:11.450,00:25:14.130
as you can get with two bodies.,00:25:14.130,00:25:16.380
"Now, the part that is
pertaining to three bodies,",00:25:16.380,00:25:19.430
"again, you would basically--
not need to worry about as long",00:25:19.430,00:25:24.000
as nd cubed is less than 1.,00:25:24.000,00:25:26.970
"So I don't quite know
what you have in mind.",00:25:26.970,00:25:32.515
"AUDIENCE: I guess I was
thinking about three-",00:25:32.515,00:25:34.393
and four-body interactions.,00:25:34.393,00:25:35.538
"But if you're covered against
that, then what I said,",00:25:35.538,00:25:38.490
it's not valid or relevant.,00:25:38.490,00:25:41.830
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:25:41.830,00:25:42.680
"So certainly, three-body
and higher body interactions",00:25:42.680,00:25:45.970
"would be important
if you're thinking",00:25:45.970,00:25:48.220
"about writing a description
for a liquid, for example.",00:25:48.220,00:25:52.790
"And then the story
becomes more complicated.",00:25:52.790,00:25:57.440
"You can't really
make the truncations",00:25:57.440,00:26:00.550
"that would give you
the Boltzmann equation.",00:26:00.550,00:26:02.620
"You need to go by some
other set of approximations,",00:26:02.620,00:26:06.070
"such as the Vlasov
equation, that you",00:26:06.070,00:26:08.160
will see in the problem set.,00:26:08.160,00:26:10.710
"And the actual theory that
one can write down for liquids",00:26:10.710,00:26:15.610
is very complicated.,00:26:15.610,00:26:17.510
So it's-- yeah.,00:26:17.510,00:26:20.150
"AUDIENCE: Can it get
more complicated yet",00:26:20.150,00:26:22.122
"if, based on the same
framework, isn't this similar",00:26:22.122,00:26:24.581
"to, like, the formulation
of the neutron transport",00:26:24.581,00:26:26.975
"equation, where if you have,
in addition to scattering,",00:26:26.975,00:26:30.570
"you have particles
that don't attract,",00:26:30.570,00:26:32.460
"but you have fission events
and you have inelastic center?",00:26:32.460,00:26:35.573
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:26:35.573,00:26:36.156
Yes.,00:26:36.156,00:26:36.230
That's good.,00:26:36.230,00:26:36.530

change dramatically, right?",00:26:36.530,00:26:38.630
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:26:38.630,00:26:39.440
That's right.,00:26:39.440,00:26:39.726
Yes.,00:26:39.726,00:26:39.870
"AUDIENCE: But my point is
that it's the same framework.",00:26:39.870,00:26:41.860
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:26:41.860,00:26:42.420
Yes.,00:26:42.420,00:26:42.919
"So basically, you're right.",00:26:42.919,00:26:44.320
"One assumption that I have here
is that the number of particles",00:26:44.320,00:26:47.650
is conserved.,00:26:47.650,00:26:49.320
"We say that if the particles
can break or diffuse,",00:26:49.320,00:26:53.010
"one has to generalize
this approximation.",00:26:53.010,00:26:56.850
"And there would be an
appropriate generalization",00:26:56.850,00:27:00.330
"of the Boltzmann equation
to cover those terms.",00:27:00.330,00:27:03.470
"And I don't have a problem
set related to that,",00:27:03.470,00:27:11.040
"but maybe you are suggesting
that I should provide one.",00:27:11.040,00:27:14.900
[LAUGHTER],00:27:14.900,00:27:16.800
OK.,00:27:17.750,00:27:18.400
That's a good point.,00:27:18.400,00:27:19.260
OK?,00:27:21.690,00:27:22.190
All right.,00:27:24.770,00:27:25.270
"So we have made some
assumptions here.",00:27:25.270,00:27:29.510
"And I guess my claim is
that this equation-- well,",00:27:29.510,00:27:34.090
what equation?,00:27:34.090,00:27:35.670
"So basically, what
I'm going to do,",00:27:35.670,00:27:38.880
"I call the right-hand
side of this equation",00:27:38.880,00:27:41.630
"after this assumption
of molecular chaos, CFF.",00:27:41.630,00:27:46.090
"For simplicity, let me call
this bunch of first derivatives",00:27:46.090,00:27:52.070
"that act on f1 L
for Liouvillian.",00:27:52.070,00:27:56.380
"It's kind of like a
Liouville operator.",00:27:56.380,00:27:58.680
"So I have an equation that is
the bunch of first derivatives",00:27:58.680,00:28:04.010
"acting on f1, which
is essentially",00:28:04.010,00:28:07.880
"a linear partial differential
equation in six or seven",00:28:07.880,00:28:12.700
"dimensions, depending on
how you count time-- is",00:28:12.700,00:28:15.770
"equal to a non-linear integral
on the right-hand side.",00:28:15.770,00:28:21.890
OK?,00:28:21.890,00:28:23.190
"So this is the entity that
is the Boltzmann equation.",00:28:23.190,00:28:26.370
"Now, the statement is that
this equation no longer",00:28:39.950,00:28:48.710
has time reversal symmetry.,00:28:48.710,00:28:51.220
"And so if I were to solve this
equation for the one function",00:28:51.220,00:28:56.420
"that I'm interested, after all,
the f1, which really tells me",00:28:56.420,00:29:00.030
"how the particles stream from
the left-hand side of the box",00:29:00.030,00:29:03.740
"to the right-hand
side of the box,",00:29:03.740,00:29:06.480
that equation is not reversible.,00:29:06.480,00:29:11.820
"That is, the solution
to this equation",00:29:11.820,00:29:14.480
"will indeed take
the density that",00:29:14.480,00:29:16.840
"was on the left-hand
side of the box",00:29:16.840,00:29:18.940
"and uniformly distribute it
on the two sides of the box.",00:29:18.940,00:29:23.450
And that will stay forever.,00:29:23.450,00:29:25.780
"That's, of course, a consequence
of the various approximations",00:29:25.780,00:29:29.450
"that we made here,
removing the reversibility.",00:29:29.450,00:29:33.140
OK?,00:29:33.140,00:29:34.810
"And the statement to
show that mathematically",00:29:34.810,00:29:37.820
"is that if there is a function--
and now, for simplicity,",00:29:37.820,00:29:41.280
"since from now on, we don't
care about f2, f3, et cetera,",00:29:41.280,00:29:45.750
"we are only caring about f1,
I'm going to drop the index one",00:29:45.750,00:29:51.250
"and say that if there is a
density f, which is really",00:29:51.250,00:29:55.980
"my f1, that satisfies
the Boltzmann-- that is,",00:29:55.980,00:30:02.760
"I have a form such as this--
then there is a quantity H that",00:30:02.760,00:30:10.610
"only depends on time that,
under the evolution that",00:30:10.610,00:30:15.620
"is implicit in this Boltzmann
equation will always decrease,",00:30:15.620,00:30:22.490
"where H is an integral
over the coordinates",00:30:22.490,00:30:29.030
"and momenta that are in this
function f of p, q, and t.",00:30:29.030,00:30:39.060
"And all I need to do is
to multiply by the log.",00:30:39.060,00:30:43.250
"And then all of these
are vectors if I drop it",00:30:45.960,00:30:50.220
for saving time.,00:30:50.220,00:30:52.480
"And we said that
once we recognize",00:30:52.480,00:30:55.350
"that f, up to a
normalization, is",00:30:55.350,00:30:57.660
"the same thing as the
one-particle probability--",00:30:57.660,00:31:01.060
"and having previously
seen objects such as this",00:31:01.060,00:31:04.440
"in probability
theory corresponding",00:31:04.440,00:31:06.990
"to entropy information,
entropy of mixing,",00:31:06.990,00:31:10.470
"you will not be surprised at
how this expression came about.",00:31:10.470,00:31:15.590
"And I had told you that in
each one of the four sections,",00:31:15.590,00:31:19.370
"we will introduce some quantity
that plays the role of entropy.",00:31:19.370,00:31:23.700
"So this is the one that is
appropriate to our section",00:31:23.700,00:31:26.680
on kinetic theory.,00:31:26.680,00:31:28.880
So let's see how we go about--,00:31:28.880,00:31:30.949
AUDIENCE: Question.,00:31:30.949,00:31:31.740
PROFESSOR: Yes?,00:31:31.740,00:31:32.460
"AUDIENCE: When you introduced
the-- initialized the concept",00:31:32.460,00:31:35.862
"of entropy of information
of the message that's",00:31:35.862,00:31:40.722
"p log p, [INAUDIBLE] entropy.",00:31:40.722,00:31:42.666
"And as far as I
understand, this concept",00:31:42.666,00:31:44.620
"came up in, like, mid 20th
century at least, right?",00:31:44.620,00:31:47.630
"PROFESSOR: I think
slightly later than that.",00:31:47.630,00:31:50.450
"Of that order, yes.",00:31:50.450,00:31:51.550
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:31:51.550,00:31:52.522
"And these are
Boltzmann equations?",00:31:52.522,00:31:54.813
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:31:54.813,00:31:55.438
"AUDIENCE: And so this was, like,
100 years before, at least?",00:31:55.438,00:31:58.578
"PROFESSOR: Not 100 years, but
maybe 60 years away, yeah.",00:31:58.578,00:32:00.911
"50, 60.",00:32:00.911,00:32:01.411
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:32:01.411,00:32:04.131
"I'm just interested, what is
the motivation for picking",00:32:04.131,00:32:07.562
"this form of functionality,
that it's integral of f log f",00:32:07.562,00:32:12.128
"rather than integral
of something else?",00:32:12.128,00:32:14.190
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:32:14.190,00:32:14.950
"I mean, there is another
place that you've seen it,",00:32:14.950,00:32:17.845
"that has nothing to
do with information.",00:32:17.845,00:32:22.210
And that's mixing entropy.,00:32:22.210,00:32:24.460
"If I have [? n ?] one
particles of one type",00:32:24.460,00:32:27.550
"and two particles of
another type, et cetera,",00:32:27.550,00:32:29.910
"and mixed them up, then
the mixing entropy,",00:32:29.910,00:32:33.130
"you can relate to a
form such as this.",00:32:33.130,00:32:36.780
It is some ni log ni.,00:32:36.780,00:32:39.050
OK?,00:32:43.370,00:32:43.870
Fine.,00:32:47.826,00:32:48.325
"It's just for
discrete variables,",00:32:52.370,00:32:54.770
"it makes much more sense
than for the continuum.",00:32:54.770,00:32:58.500
But OK.,00:32:58.500,00:33:00.370
"So let's see if this
is indeed the case.",00:33:00.370,00:33:05.060
"So we say that dH
by dt is the-- I",00:33:05.060,00:33:10.550
"have to take the time
derivative inside.",00:33:10.550,00:33:15.330
"And as we discussed
before, the full derivative",00:33:15.330,00:33:19.450
"becomes a partial derivative
inside the integral.",00:33:19.450,00:33:23.210
"And I have either
acting on f and acting",00:33:23.210,00:33:28.060
"on log f, which will
give me 1 over f,",00:33:28.060,00:33:30.720
canceling the f outside.,00:33:30.720,00:33:33.110
"And this term corresponded
to the derivative",00:33:33.110,00:33:38.660
"of the normalization,
which is fixed.",00:33:38.660,00:33:41.760
"And then we had to replace
what we have for df by dt.",00:33:41.760,00:33:49.215
"And for df by dt, we either
have the Poisson bracket",00:33:51.850,00:34:00.466
"of the one-particle Hamiltonian
with f coming from the L",00:34:00.466,00:34:06.790
"part of the equation, once
we get d by dt on one side.",00:34:06.790,00:34:12.000
"And then the collision part
that depends on two f's.",00:34:12.000,00:34:15.980
"And we have to
multiply this by f.",00:34:15.980,00:34:19.250
"And again, let's remind you that
f really has argument-- oops,",00:34:19.250,00:34:24.920
log f-- that has argument p1.,00:34:24.920,00:34:29.940
I won't write q1 and t.,00:34:29.940,00:34:31.500
"And the next thing that we
did at the end of last lecture",00:34:36.330,00:34:40.580
"is that typically, when you have
integral of a Poisson bracket",00:34:40.580,00:34:46.889
"by doing some combination
of integrations by part,",00:34:46.889,00:34:50.670
"you can even eventually show
that this contribution is 0.",00:34:50.670,00:34:56.360
"And really, the important
thing is the integration",00:34:56.360,00:35:00.510
"against the collision term
of the Boltzmann equation.",00:35:00.510,00:35:04.640
"So writing that explicitly,
what do we have?",00:35:04.640,00:35:09.510
"We have that it is
integral d cubed.",00:35:09.510,00:35:13.290
Let's say q1.,00:35:13.290,00:35:17.060
"Again, I don't
really need to keep",00:35:17.060,00:35:20.290
"track of the index on
this dummy variable.",00:35:20.290,00:35:24.090
I have the integral over q1.,00:35:24.090,00:35:26.290
I have the two integral over p1.,00:35:26.290,00:35:28.860
"Let's keep it so that it
doesn't confuse anybody.",00:35:28.860,00:35:32.530
Then I have the collision term.,00:35:32.530,00:35:36.040
"Now, the collision term is
a bunch of integrals itself.",00:35:36.040,00:35:39.980
"It involves integrals over p2,
integral over an impact vector",00:35:39.980,00:35:47.530
"b, the relative velocity.",00:35:47.530,00:35:50.070
"And then I had minus
f of p1, f of p2",00:35:53.940,00:36:01.910
"for the loss in the channel
because of the collisions,",00:36:01.910,00:36:05.990
"plus the addition to the channel
from the inverse collisions.",00:36:05.990,00:36:10.690
"And this whole thing
has to be multiplied",00:36:13.890,00:36:16.060
by log f evaluated at p1.,00:36:16.060,00:36:22.041
OK?,00:36:22.041,00:36:24.480
"So that's really the quantity
that we are interested.",00:36:24.480,00:36:28.280
"And the quantity that we
are interested, we notice,",00:36:28.280,00:36:31.200
"has some kind of a symmetry with
respect to indices one and two.",00:36:31.200,00:36:36.880
"Something to do with prime
and un-prime coordinates.",00:36:36.880,00:36:40.920
"But multiplied this bracket that
has all of these symmetries,",00:36:40.920,00:36:44.980
"with this function that is only
evaluated for one of the four",00:36:44.980,00:36:49.780
"coordinates for momenta
that are appearing here.",00:36:49.780,00:36:54.460
"So our next set of tasks is to
somehow make this as symmetric",00:36:54.460,00:36:59.420
as possible.,00:36:59.420,00:37:01.070
"So the first thing that we
do is we exchange indices one",00:37:01.070,00:37:06.250
"and two, because really, these
are simply dummy integration",00:37:06.250,00:37:10.920
variables.,00:37:10.920,00:37:12.370
"I can call the thing that I was
calling p1 p2, and vice versa.",00:37:12.370,00:37:16.750
"And the integration then
becomes the integral over q.",00:37:16.750,00:37:21.380
"Maybe that's why it's useful not
to have, for the q, any index,",00:37:21.380,00:37:26.290
"because I don't care to
change the index for that.",00:37:26.290,00:37:32.110
"d cubed p2, p1.",00:37:32.110,00:37:34.500
"Doesn't really matter in
what order I write them.",00:37:34.500,00:37:38.780
d2b is a relative separation.,00:37:38.780,00:37:43.330
"Again, it's an impact parameter.",00:37:43.330,00:37:47.120
I can call this v1 minus v2.,00:37:47.120,00:37:50.200
"But since it's an
absolute value,",00:37:50.200,00:37:51.990
it doesn't matter really.,00:37:51.990,00:37:54.030
"And so the only
thing that happens",00:37:54.030,00:37:56.950
"is that I will have--
essentially, the product is",00:37:56.950,00:37:59.985
symmetric.,00:37:59.985,00:38:00.485
"The only thing that
was separately f",00:38:08.410,00:38:13.970
"of p1 before now
becomes f of p2.",00:38:13.970,00:38:16.410
"And then what I can do is I
can say, OK, those are really",00:38:18.980,00:38:22.420
"two forms of the same integral,
and I can average them,",00:38:22.420,00:38:27.040
"and write the average, which is
1/2 the integral d cubed q, d",00:38:27.040,00:38:33.310
"cubed p1, d cubed p2, d2 b,
relative velocity, minus f",00:38:33.310,00:38:45.200
"of p1, f of p2, f of p1
prime, f of p2 prime.",00:38:45.200,00:38:53.700
"And then I have a log of f
of p1 plus log of f of p2.",00:38:53.700,00:39:03.420
And I have divided through 1/2.,00:39:03.420,00:39:07.845
OK?,00:39:07.845,00:39:08.345
"So what I will do is to
now write the next line.",00:39:14.070,00:39:22.200
"And then we'll spend some
time discussing what happens.",00:39:22.200,00:39:27.320
"So artificially, what will
happen looks like I essentially",00:39:27.320,00:39:32.500
"move prime and un-prime things
the same way that I exchanged",00:39:32.500,00:39:37.800
one and two indices before.,00:39:37.800,00:39:40.270
"I will exchange the superscripts
that are prime or non-prime.",00:39:40.270,00:39:45.010
"And if I were to do that, I
will get an integral d cubed q,",00:39:45.010,00:39:51.268
"d cubed, let's say, p1 prime,
d cubed p2 prime, d2b, v2 minus",00:39:51.268,00:39:59.980
"v1 prime, minus
f of p1-- [SIGHS]",00:39:59.980,00:40:09.740
"--prime, f or p2 prime,
plus f of p1, f of p2.",00:40:12.710,00:40:22.790
"And then here, we
would have log of f",00:40:22.790,00:40:25.470
"of p1 prime, log
of f of p2 prime.",00:40:25.470,00:40:31.820
OK?,00:40:31.820,00:40:34.180
"So this is a statement
that just saying,",00:40:34.180,00:40:40.290
"I moved the primes
and un-primes,",00:40:40.290,00:40:43.550
"it's very easy to come
up with this answer.",00:40:43.550,00:40:47.080
"What you have to think very
much about what that means.",00:40:47.080,00:40:52.080
"Essentially, what I
had originally was",00:40:52.080,00:40:55.660
"integration
invariables p1 and p2.",00:40:55.660,00:41:02.070
"And p1 prime and p2 prime were
never integration variables.",00:41:02.070,00:41:07.090
"So there was not
symmetry at the level",00:41:07.090,00:41:09.650
"that I have written
between one and two, which",00:41:09.650,00:41:13.070
"are integration
variables, and one prime",00:41:13.070,00:41:15.790
"and two prime, which
are the quantities that,",00:41:15.790,00:41:19.630
"through the collision operator,
are related to p1 and p2.",00:41:19.630,00:41:24.750
"So essentially, p1
prime and p2 prime",00:41:24.750,00:41:28.920
"are the kind of functions
that we have written here.",00:41:28.920,00:41:33.330
"Here, I had p1 double
prime, p2 double prime.",00:41:33.330,00:41:35.970
"But up to sort of inverting
some signs, et cetera,",00:41:35.970,00:41:40.300
"this is the kind of functional
relationship that you have",00:41:40.300,00:41:45.290
between p primes and p's.,00:41:45.290,00:41:50.380
OK?,00:41:50.380,00:41:51.810
"So now we have to worry
about a number of things.",00:41:51.810,00:41:56.080
"The simplest one
is actually what",00:41:56.080,00:41:58.180
"happened to this factor
here-- the relative velocity.",00:41:58.180,00:42:05.170
"Now think back about
collisions that you",00:42:05.170,00:42:08.200
have in the center of mass.,00:42:08.200,00:42:10.360
"In the center of
mass, two particles",00:42:10.360,00:42:12.590
"come with velocities that
are opposite each other.",00:42:12.590,00:42:17.500
"They bang onto each other,
go different direction.",00:42:17.500,00:42:21.320
"The magnitude of the
velocities does not",00:42:21.320,00:42:23.620
"change an inelastic
collision, which",00:42:23.620,00:42:25.510
is what we are looking at.,00:42:25.510,00:42:27.460
Right?,00:42:27.460,00:42:28.720
"So after the collision, what
we have is that p2 prime minus",00:42:28.720,00:42:34.800
"p1 prime is the same
thing as p1 and minus",00:42:34.800,00:42:38.380
p2 for elastic conditions.,00:42:38.380,00:42:39.735
"So as far as this
factor is concerned,",00:42:42.770,00:42:45.640
"I could very well replace
that with v1 minus v2",00:42:45.640,00:42:55.180
without the primes.,00:42:55.180,00:42:56.220
"It really doesn't
make any difference.",00:42:56.220,00:42:57.835
"Another thing that you
can convince yourself",00:43:01.210,00:43:06.060
"is that from the perspective
of the picture that I drew,",00:43:06.060,00:43:12.640
"there was some kind
of an impact vector B.",00:43:12.640,00:43:17.071
"You say, well, what
happens if I look",00:43:17.071,00:43:19.060
"at from the perspective of the
products of the interaction?",00:43:19.060,00:43:22.780
"So the products
of the interaction",00:43:22.780,00:43:24.600
"are going in a
different direction.",00:43:24.600,00:43:27.270
"I would have to redraw
my coordinates that",00:43:27.270,00:43:30.670
"would correspond to
A prime and B prime.",00:43:30.670,00:43:34.820
"But what you can convince
yourself that essentially,",00:43:34.820,00:43:38.380
"the impact parameter, as far
as these products is concerned,",00:43:38.380,00:43:43.200
"is just a rotated version
of the original one",00:43:43.200,00:43:46.110
without changing its magnitude.,00:43:46.110,00:43:49.070
"So you have also that
magnitude of b prime",00:43:49.070,00:43:53.220
"is the same thing
as magnitude of b.",00:43:53.220,00:43:55.950
"There's a rotation, but
the impact parameter",00:43:55.950,00:43:59.610
does not change.,00:43:59.610,00:44:01.090
"If you like, that
is also related",00:44:01.090,00:44:03.320
"to conservation of energy,
because if it wasn't so,",00:44:03.320,00:44:08.190
"the potential energy
would be different",00:44:08.190,00:44:11.670
right after the collisions.,00:44:11.670,00:44:13.920
OK?,00:44:13.920,00:44:16.620
"So I really was kind
of careless here.",00:44:16.620,00:44:21.215
"I should have
written d2 b prime.",00:44:21.215,00:44:24.280
"But I could have
written also d2b.",00:44:24.280,00:44:26.310
It didn't make any difference.,00:44:26.310,00:44:27.660
It's the same.,00:44:27.660,00:44:30.660
"And then, of course, these
functions-- essentially,",00:44:30.660,00:44:38.860
"you can see that you say, OK,
I start with, here, p1 and p2.",00:44:38.860,00:44:47.330
"And these were
functions of p1 and p2.",00:44:47.330,00:44:50.920
"And here, I have reversed this.",00:44:50.920,00:44:52.730
"p1 prime and p2 prime are
the integration variables.",00:44:52.730,00:44:58.490
"p1 and p2 are functions
of p1 prime and p2 prime",00:44:58.490,00:45:02.950
"that, in principle, are
obtained by inverting",00:45:02.950,00:45:07.130
this set of equations.,00:45:07.130,00:45:10.034
Right?,00:45:10.034,00:45:12.500
"But it really, again,
doesn't matter,",00:45:12.500,00:45:15.300
"because once you have
specified what incoming p1, p2,",00:45:15.300,00:45:20.630
"and b are, you know what the
outcome of the collision is.",00:45:20.630,00:45:24.520
"So it's really
the same function.",00:45:24.520,00:45:26.670
"Whether you are
inverting it, you",00:45:26.670,00:45:28.750
"will, again, presume
the different location",00:45:28.750,00:45:32.000
"of the arguments, but you will
have the same function that",00:45:32.000,00:45:35.080
"would tell you what the
inverse relationship is.",00:45:35.080,00:45:38.500
"So really, these
functional forms",00:45:38.500,00:45:41.120
"are the same as the functional
forms that we had before.",00:45:41.120,00:45:45.120
"And finally, I
claim that in order",00:45:45.120,00:45:48.990
"to go through this
change of variable,",00:45:48.990,00:45:52.920
"I have to also deal with the
Jacobian of the transformation.",00:45:52.920,00:45:57.670
"But that we have the
d3p1d3p2 is the same thing",00:45:57.670,00:46:02.790
as d3p1 prime d3p2 prime.,00:46:02.790,00:46:08.140
"And that, in some sense,
you can sort of also",00:46:08.140,00:46:11.480
"think about what we were doing
before with the Liouville",00:46:11.480,00:46:14.810
"equation maintaining the
volume of phase space.",00:46:14.810,00:46:18.730
"So I have some volume of phase
space prior to the collision.",00:46:18.730,00:46:23.490
"After the collision, I would
need to have the same volume.",00:46:23.490,00:46:27.730
"There is, of course,
in the volumes",00:46:27.730,00:46:30.130
"that we are considering for the
case of the Liouville operator,",00:46:30.130,00:46:33.890
"in addition,
products of dq1, dq2.",00:46:33.890,00:46:38.740
"But you can see that
all of those things",00:46:38.740,00:46:41.410
"are really put into
the same volume when",00:46:41.410,00:46:44.780
"we are considering
the collision.",00:46:44.780,00:46:46.840
"So really, the only
thing that is left",00:46:46.840,00:46:49.270
"is that the Liouvillian
preservation",00:46:49.270,00:46:53.560
"of the volume of
phase space would",00:46:53.560,00:46:56.440
"say that the Jacobian
here, you can also ignore.",00:46:56.440,00:47:00.160
Yes.,00:47:00.160,00:47:00.660
"AUDIENCE: So are you assuming
that this transformation",00:47:00.660,00:47:03.782
"[INAUDIBLE] is [? an article, ?]
because it's [INAUDIBLE]?",00:47:03.782,00:47:08.246
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:47:08.246,00:47:10.110
"So everything that we do
is within the framework",00:47:10.110,00:47:14.010
"of a Hamiltonian
evolution equation.",00:47:14.010,00:47:18.112
OK?,00:47:18.112,00:47:19.040
"So if you like,
these kinds of things",00:47:19.040,00:47:22.850
"that I'm saying
here sometimes are",00:47:22.850,00:47:25.260
"said to be consequence of
microscopic reversibility,",00:47:25.260,00:47:29.730
"in that I'm sort of using,
in this panel over here,",00:47:29.730,00:47:34.720
"things that are completely
Newtonian and microscopic.",00:47:34.720,00:47:38.300
"The place that I use statistical
argument was over here.",00:47:38.300,00:47:45.186
OK?,00:47:45.186,00:47:46.540
"So essentially,
having done that,",00:47:46.540,00:47:50.550
"you can basically
also rename variables.",00:47:50.550,00:47:55.200
"Things that I was calling
p1 prime I can call p1.",00:47:55.200,00:47:59.000
"It's another renaming
of some variable.",00:47:59.000,00:48:05.860
"And again, it really doesn't
matter which relative velocity",00:48:08.570,00:48:15.120
I write down.,00:48:15.120,00:48:15.790
They're all the same thing.,00:48:15.790,00:48:17.630
"So what will happen
is that I will",00:48:17.630,00:48:19.380
"get minus f or p1, f of p2, plus
f of p1 prime, f of p2 prime.",00:48:19.380,00:48:28.940
"And the only thing that happened
is that the logs-- oops.",00:48:28.940,00:48:37.670
I should have maintained.,00:48:37.670,00:48:39.010
"I don't know why--
where I made a mistake.",00:48:43.735,00:48:47.030
"But I should ultimately have
come up with this answer.",00:48:47.030,00:48:52.080
"So what I wanted
to do, and I really",00:48:55.490,00:48:58.840
"have to maybe look
at it again, is",00:48:58.840,00:49:02.850
"do one more step
of symmetrization.",00:49:02.850,00:49:07.920
"The answer will come down to an
integral over p1 and p2, d2b,",00:49:07.920,00:49:17.180
at relative velocity.,00:49:17.180,00:49:18.720
"We would have minus f of p1,
f of p2, plus f of p1 prime,",00:49:23.060,00:49:31.410
f of p2 prime.,00:49:31.410,00:49:32.970
"So this is our
collision operator",00:49:32.970,00:49:36.286
"that we have discussed
here-- the difference",00:49:36.286,00:49:38.650
"between what comes in
and what comes out.",00:49:38.650,00:49:42.240
"And from the first part here,
we should get log of f of p1,",00:49:42.240,00:49:49.660
"plus log of f of p2,
which is the same thing",00:49:49.660,00:49:52.220
as the log of the product.,00:49:52.220,00:49:53.475
"And if I had not made
errors, the subtraction",00:49:56.070,00:50:02.140
"would have involved f of
p1 prime, f of p2 prime.",00:50:02.140,00:50:05.460
"And the idea is that if you
think about the function",00:50:09.890,00:50:16.510
"log of something as a
function of that something,",00:50:16.510,00:50:24.650
the log is a monotonic function.,00:50:24.650,00:50:28.710
"So that if you were to
evaluate the log at two",00:50:28.710,00:50:33.600
"different points,
the sign of the log",00:50:33.600,00:50:38.440
"would grow in the same
way as the sign of the two",00:50:38.440,00:50:42.070
"points, which means that here,
you have the difference of two",00:50:42.070,00:50:49.190
logs.,00:50:49.190,00:50:50.470
"This is like log of
s1 minus log of s2.",00:50:50.470,00:50:57.310
"And it is multiplied
with minus s1 minus s2.",00:50:57.310,00:51:02.820
"So if s1 is greater
than s2, log s1",00:51:02.820,00:51:05.860
would be greater than log s2.,00:51:05.860,00:51:07.190
"If s1 is less than s2, log
s1 would be less than log s2.",00:51:07.190,00:51:12.040
"In either case,
what you would find",00:51:12.040,00:51:15.050
"is that the product of the
two brackets is negative.",00:51:15.050,00:51:18.830
"And this whole thing
has to be negative.",00:51:18.830,00:51:20.570
OK.,00:51:23.870,00:51:24.370
"So the thing that confused
me-- and maybe we can go back",00:51:24.370,00:51:31.020
"and look at is that probably,
what I was doing here",00:51:31.020,00:51:40.130
"was a little bit too
impatient, because when",00:51:40.130,00:51:47.510
"I changed variables,
p1 prime f of p2.",00:51:47.510,00:51:57.640
I removed the primes.,00:52:00.310,00:52:01.580
Log.,00:52:06.416,00:52:06.915
Reduced primes.,00:52:09.726,00:52:10.350
"Actually, I had it here.",00:52:14.430,00:52:15.785
I don't know why I was worried.,00:52:15.785,00:52:17.831
Yeah.,00:52:17.831,00:52:18.330
"So the signs are, I think,
right, that when I add them,",00:52:18.330,00:52:22.570
I would get the subtraction.,00:52:22.570,00:52:24.770
"So in one case, I had the f's of
the p's with the negative sign.",00:52:24.770,00:52:32.640
"After I did this change, they
appear with the positive sign.",00:52:32.640,00:52:38.410
"So there is the sign difference
between the two of them.",00:52:38.410,00:52:43.540
OK?,00:52:43.540,00:52:45.380
"So we have a
function, therefore,",00:52:45.380,00:52:49.230
"that, just like entropy
throughout the process,",00:52:49.230,00:52:52.330
will increase.,00:52:52.330,00:52:53.570
This is like a negative entropy.,00:52:53.570,00:52:56.820
"If I were to really solve
this set of equations,",00:52:56.820,00:53:00.630
"starting with the f that
describes things that",00:53:00.630,00:53:03.305
"are distributed in
this box, and then",00:53:03.305,00:53:06.200
"allow it to expand
into the other box,",00:53:06.200,00:53:09.600
"it will follow--
this solution will",00:53:09.600,00:53:12.380
"follow some particular
trajectory that will ultimately",00:53:12.380,00:53:17.910
"no longer change as
a function of time.",00:53:17.910,00:53:21.050
It will not go back and forth.,00:53:21.050,00:53:22.840
"It will not have the
full reversibility",00:53:22.840,00:53:26.360
"that these set of
equations does have.",00:53:26.360,00:53:30.490
"Now, that's actually
not a bad thing.",00:53:30.490,00:53:32.780
"It is true, indeed, that these
equations are reversible.",00:53:32.780,00:53:37.690
"And there is a theorem that
if you wait sufficiently long,",00:53:37.690,00:53:41.730
this will go back into here.,00:53:41.730,00:53:44.960
"But the time it take
for that to happen",00:53:44.960,00:53:48.130
"grows something of the order of
the size of the system divided",00:53:48.130,00:53:53.085
these.,00:53:53.085,00:53:53.585
"The time, up to
various pre-factors,",00:53:56.100,00:53:58.940
"would grow exponentially
with the number of particles",00:53:58.940,00:54:02.630
that you have.,00:54:02.630,00:54:04.490
"And remember that you
have of the order of 10",00:54:04.490,00:54:07.390
to the 23 particles.,00:54:07.390,00:54:10.050
"So there is, indeed,
mathematically rigorously,",00:54:10.050,00:54:13.290
"a recursion time if you really
had this box sitting in vacuum",00:54:13.290,00:54:19.510
"and there was no influence on
the walls of the container.",00:54:19.510,00:54:23.420
"After many, many, many,
many ages of the universe,",00:54:23.420,00:54:27.760
"the gas would go back
for an instant of time",00:54:27.760,00:54:31.270
"in the other box, and
then would go over there.",00:54:31.270,00:54:34.120
"But that's something that really
is of no practical relevance",00:54:34.120,00:54:39.690
"when we are thinking about
the gas and how it expands.",00:54:39.690,00:54:44.310
OK?,00:54:44.310,00:54:45.500
"But now let's see, with
these approximations,",00:54:45.500,00:54:49.210
can we do better.,00:54:49.210,00:54:51.140
"Can we figure out
exactly how long does it",00:54:51.140,00:54:53.840
"take for the gas to go from
one side to the other side.",00:54:53.840,00:54:58.180
"And what is the shape of the
streamlines and everything else",00:54:58.180,00:55:01.670
as this process is taking place?,00:55:01.670,00:55:04.550
Yes.,00:55:04.550,00:55:06.704
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:55:06.704,00:55:07.620
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:55:23.800,00:55:25.580
Yes.,00:55:25.580,00:55:26.080
"So if you like, we
want to think of this",00:55:26.080,00:55:30.380
"in terms of information,
in terms of entropy.",00:55:30.380,00:55:32.835
It doesn't matter.,00:55:32.835,00:55:33.730
"It is something that is
changing as a function of time.",00:55:33.730,00:55:37.610
"And the timescale by
which that happens",00:55:37.610,00:55:40.620
"has to do with the timescales
that we set up and imprinted",00:55:40.620,00:55:45.200
into this equation.,00:55:45.200,00:55:47.017
OK?,00:55:47.017,00:55:48.440
"So the next step
that I have to answer",00:55:48.440,00:55:51.410
"is, what is that time step?",00:55:51.410,00:55:54.260
"And in particular, if I look
at this equation by itself,",00:55:54.260,00:55:58.270
"I would say that it
has two timescales.",00:55:58.270,00:56:01.330
"On the left-hand side,
you have this tau",00:56:01.330,00:56:04.310
"that has to do with
the size of the box.",00:56:04.310,00:56:06.990
We said it's very long.,00:56:06.990,00:56:09.350
"On the right-hand
side, it has the time",00:56:09.350,00:56:13.100
"that I have to wait
for a collision",00:56:13.100,00:56:15.290
"to occur, which is certainly
much shorter than this time,",00:56:15.290,00:56:20.590
for an ordinary gas.,00:56:20.590,00:56:23.170
"And so we expect, therefore,
that the right-hand side",00:56:23.170,00:56:27.260
"of this equation would determine
things much more rapidly",00:56:27.260,00:56:31.800
"compared to the left-hand
side of the equation.",00:56:31.800,00:56:35.040
"And we want to now
quantify that and make that",00:56:35.040,00:56:39.700
"into something that
is relevant to things",00:56:39.700,00:56:42.610
"that we know and understand
about a gas expand.",00:56:42.610,00:56:47.670
OK?,00:56:47.670,00:56:49.480
"So let's sort of think about,
well, what would happen?",00:56:49.480,00:56:55.350
"We said that this H,
as a function of time,",00:56:55.350,00:57:01.070
is going in one direction.,00:57:01.070,00:57:04.140
"Presumably, after some time--
we don't know how long here,",00:57:04.140,00:57:08.060
"and that's a good
question-- eventually,",00:57:08.060,00:57:10.440
"hopefully, it will
reach an equilibrium,",00:57:10.440,00:57:12.500
"like, the entropy
will cease to change.",00:57:12.500,00:57:15.320
"And the question is,
what is this equilibrium?",00:57:15.320,00:57:19.175
"So let's see if we can gain some
information about equilibrium.",00:57:19.175,00:57:21.800
"So we said that dH
by dt presumably",00:57:30.380,00:57:34.210
"has to be 0, because
if it is not 0,",00:57:34.210,00:57:38.330
"then it can continue
to decrease.",00:57:38.330,00:57:40.650
"You are not quite
where you want to be.",00:57:40.650,00:57:44.920
"Now let's look at what is the
condition for dH by dt to be 0.",00:57:44.920,00:57:50.630
"H is this integral that
I have to perform over",00:57:50.630,00:57:56.050
the entire phase space.,00:57:56.050,00:58:00.010
"Now, each element of
that integral evaluated",00:58:00.010,00:58:04.050
"at some particular
location in phase space",00:58:04.050,00:58:07.200
is by itself positive.,00:58:07.200,00:58:09.090
"This argument that
we had before is not",00:58:09.090,00:58:12.070
about the entire integral.,00:58:12.070,00:58:13.800
"It's valid about every little
piece of the integration",00:58:13.800,00:58:17.010
that I am making.,00:58:17.010,00:58:18.340
It has a particular sign.,00:58:18.340,00:58:20.830
"So if the entire integral has to
be 0, every little piece of it",00:58:20.830,00:58:26.530
has to be individually 0.,00:58:26.530,00:58:29.770
"So that means that
I would require",00:58:29.770,00:58:32.310
"that log of f at
any q evaluated,",00:58:32.310,00:58:39.190
"let's say, for p1 and p2
should be the same thing",00:58:39.190,00:58:47.680
"as log of f evaluated
at p1 prime and p2.",00:58:47.680,00:58:53.230
This would be true for all q.,00:58:58.490,00:59:03.680
Right?,00:59:03.680,00:59:04.180
"You look at this and
you say, well, what?",00:59:09.040,00:59:11.630
This seems kind of-- yes?,00:59:11.630,00:59:14.560
"AUDIENCE: What about the
other one in parentheses,",00:59:14.560,00:59:17.015
beside the integral?,00:59:17.015,00:59:19.500
PROFESSOR: It is the same thing.,00:59:19.500,00:59:21.350
So this is s1 minus s2.,00:59:21.350,00:59:24.300
"And the other is
log of s1 minus s2.",00:59:24.300,00:59:26.700
"So I'm saying that the only time
it is 0 is s1 is equal to s2.",00:59:26.700,00:59:30.823
"When s1 equals to s2,
both parentheses are 0.",00:59:34.447,00:59:38.360
"Although, even if it wasn't,
it would have been sufficient",00:59:38.360,00:59:41.000
for one parentheses to be 0.,00:59:41.000,00:59:42.620
"But this is necessary, because
the sign is determined by this.",00:59:42.620,00:59:48.210
OK?,00:59:48.210,00:59:49.566
"Now, you look at this
and you say, well,",00:59:49.566,00:59:51.450
"what the he-- what
does this mean?",00:59:51.450,00:59:53.780
"How can I-- and the functions
p1 prime and p2 prime I",00:59:53.780,00:59:59.220
"have to get by integrating
Newton's equations.",00:59:59.220,01:00:02.300
"I have no idea how
complicated they are.",01:00:02.300,01:00:04.920
"And you want me to
solve this equation.",01:00:04.920,01:00:08.670
"Well, I tell you that
the answer to this",01:00:08.670,01:00:10.410
is actually very simple.,01:00:10.410,01:00:12.580
"So let me write the
answer to it in stages.",01:00:12.580,01:00:17.080
Log of f of p and q.,01:00:17.080,01:00:21.615
"So it's a function
of p and q that I'm",01:00:21.615,01:00:24.390
"after that have to be
evaluated at p1, p2,",01:00:24.390,01:00:28.090
"and then should be equal
to p1 prime and p2 prime",01:00:28.090,01:00:31.320
"for any combination of p1,
p2, et cetera, that I choose.",01:00:31.320,01:00:35.702
"Well, I say, OK, I will put
any function of q that I like.",01:00:35.702,01:00:41.980
"And that will work, because
it's independent of p.",01:00:41.980,01:00:46.810
"So I have minus
alpha, minus alpha",01:00:46.810,01:00:48.940
"is the same as minus
alpha, minus alpha.",01:00:48.940,01:00:52.030
OK?,01:00:52.030,01:00:52.890
"Then I claim that, OK, I
will put a minus gamma dot p.",01:00:52.890,01:00:57.800
Gamma could be dependent on q.,01:00:57.800,01:01:00.360
Dot p.,01:01:00.360,01:01:02.720
"And I claim that that would
work, because that term would",01:01:02.720,01:01:07.590
"give me gamma dot
p1 plus p2, gamma",01:01:07.590,01:01:11.555
dot p1 prime plus p2 prime.,01:01:11.555,01:01:14.550
What do I know for sure?,01:01:14.550,01:01:16.150
Momentum is conserved.,01:01:16.150,01:01:18.240
"p1 plus p2 is the same thing
as p1 prime plus p2 prime.",01:01:18.240,01:01:24.280
"It's just the
conservation of momentum.",01:01:24.280,01:01:26.760
I know that to be true for sure.,01:01:26.760,01:01:30.670
"And finally, kinetic
energy is conserved.",01:01:30.670,01:01:34.790
"Once I'm away from the location
where the interaction is taking",01:01:34.790,01:01:39.440
"place, I can choose
any function of q",01:01:39.440,01:01:43.580
"multiplied with p
squared over 2m.",01:01:43.580,01:01:46.970
"And then on the
left-hand side, I",01:01:46.970,01:01:48.820
"would have the sum of the
incoming kinetic energies.",01:01:48.820,01:01:51.910
"On the right-hand
side, I would have",01:01:51.910,01:01:53.410
"the sum of outgoing
kinetic energies.",01:01:53.410,01:01:56.740
So what have I done?,01:01:56.740,01:01:58.800
"I have identified
quantities that",01:01:58.800,01:02:02.090
are conserved in the collision.,01:02:02.090,01:02:04.260
"So basically, I
can keep going if I",01:02:04.260,01:02:06.960
have additional such things.,01:02:06.960,01:02:10.290
"And so basically,
the key to this",01:02:10.290,01:02:13.640
"is to identify
collision-conserved quantities.",01:02:13.640,01:02:18.020
"And so momentum, energy,
the first one corresponds",01:02:21.440,01:02:26.030
to the number of particles.,01:02:26.030,01:02:27.970
"These are quantities
that are conserved.",01:02:27.970,01:02:30.740
"And so you know that
this form will work,",01:02:30.740,01:02:33.610
"which means that I have a
candidate for equilibrium,",01:02:33.610,01:02:38.450
"which is that f of p and q
should have a form that is",01:02:38.450,01:02:43.580
"exponential of some function of
q that I don't-- at this stage,",01:02:43.580,01:02:49.540
could be quite arbitrary.,01:02:49.540,01:02:51.830
"And some other function of
q times p squared minus 2m.",01:02:51.830,01:02:59.150
"And let me absorb
this other gamma term.",01:02:59.150,01:03:03.750
"I can certainly do so
by putting something",01:03:03.750,01:03:06.690
like pi of 1 squared over 2m.,01:03:06.690,01:03:11.400
OK?,01:03:15.900,01:03:18.726
"And this certainly
is a form that",01:03:18.726,01:03:23.030
"will set the right-hand
side of the H theorem to 0.",01:03:23.030,01:03:31.660
"And furthermore, it
sets the right-hand side",01:03:31.660,01:03:36.130
"of the Boltzmann equation
to 0, because, again,",01:03:36.130,01:03:39.220
"for the Boltzmann
equation, all I",01:03:39.220,01:03:40.840
"needed was that the
product of two f's",01:03:40.840,01:03:43.190
"should be the same before
and after the collision.",01:03:43.190,01:03:46.590
And this is just the logs.,01:03:46.590,01:03:49.030
"If I were to exponentiate that,
I have exactly what I need.",01:03:49.030,01:03:53.300
"So basically, this also
sets the right-hand side",01:03:53.300,01:03:57.690
of the Boltzmann equation to 0.,01:03:57.690,01:04:00.000
"And this is what I will
call a local equilibrium.",01:04:00.000,01:04:02.650
What do I mean by that?,01:04:08.420,01:04:10.600
"Essentially, we can
see that right now, I",01:04:10.600,01:04:13.250
"have no knowledge
about the relationship",01:04:13.250,01:04:16.510
"between different
points in space,",01:04:16.510,01:04:18.920
"because these alpha, beta, and
pi are completely arbitrary, as",01:04:18.920,01:04:22.700
"far as my argumentation
so far is concerned.",01:04:22.700,01:04:26.770
"So locally, at each point in q,
I can have a form such as this.",01:04:26.770,01:04:33.280
"And this form, you
should remind you",01:04:33.280,01:04:36.480
"it's something like a Boltzmann
weight of the kinetic energy,",01:04:36.480,01:04:40.750
"but moving in some
particular direction.",01:04:40.750,01:04:44.180
"And essentially,
what this captures",01:04:44.180,01:04:49.950
"is that through relaxing
the right-hand side",01:04:49.950,01:04:54.220
"of the Boltzmann
equation, we randomize",01:04:54.220,01:04:57.930
"the magnitude of the momenta,
so that the magnitudes",01:04:57.930,01:05:03.170
"of the kinetic energy are
kind of Boltzmann-distributed.",01:05:03.170,01:05:08.890
This is what this term does.,01:05:08.890,01:05:11.910
"If I say that this term being
much larger than this term",01:05:11.910,01:05:19.990
is the more important one.,01:05:19.990,01:05:21.440
"If I need neglect this,
then this is what happens.",01:05:21.440,01:05:24.020
"I will very rapidly
reach a situation",01:05:24.020,01:05:27.620
"in which the momenta
have been randomized",01:05:27.620,01:05:31.005
through the collisions.,01:05:31.005,01:05:32.410
"Essentially, the
collisions, they",01:05:32.410,01:05:35.040
"change the direction
of the momenta.",01:05:35.040,01:05:39.550
"They preserve the
average of the momenta.",01:05:39.550,01:05:43.880
"So there is some
sense of the momentum",01:05:43.880,01:05:45.940
"of the incoming thing
that is left over still.",01:05:45.940,01:05:49.660
"But there is some
relaxation that took place.",01:05:49.660,01:05:53.290
"But clearly, this is not
the end of the story,",01:05:53.290,01:05:56.450
"because this f that
I have written here--",01:05:56.450,01:05:58.940
let's say local equilibrium.,01:05:58.940,01:06:01.650
"f local equilibrium does not
satisfy the Boltzmann equation.",01:06:01.650,01:06:11.464
Right?,01:06:11.464,01:06:13.080
"It set the right-hand side of
the Boltzmann equation to 0.",01:06:13.080,01:06:17.490
"But it doesn't set
the left-hand side.",01:06:17.490,01:06:19.470
"The left-hand side completely
is unhappy with this.",01:06:19.470,01:06:23.990
"For the left-hand
side to be 0, I",01:06:23.990,01:06:27.260
"would require the Poisson
bracket of H1 and f to be 0.",01:06:27.260,01:06:32.640
"After all, the
Liouvillian operator",01:06:32.640,01:06:35.300
"had the Poisson
bracket of H1 and f.",01:06:35.300,01:06:38.690
"And we have seen
functions that satisfy",01:06:38.690,01:06:41.310
"this have to be of the form
f1 of H. And in our case,",01:06:41.310,01:06:49.500
"my f1 is simply the kinetic
energy of one particle,",01:06:49.500,01:06:54.240
"plus the potential
due to the box.",01:06:54.240,01:06:56.385
OK?,01:06:59.390,01:07:01.560
"So you can see that the only way
that I can make this marriage",01:07:01.560,01:07:08.640
"with this is to have a
global equilibrium, where",01:07:08.640,01:07:18.670
"f for the global equilibrium
is proportional, let's say,",01:07:18.670,01:07:28.390
"to exponential of minus beta
p squared over 2m plus U of q.",01:07:28.390,01:07:35.200
OK?,01:07:39.592,01:07:41.060
"So I identify a piece that looks
like this p squared over 2m.",01:07:41.060,01:07:47.430
"I have to make pi to be 0
in order to achieve this.",01:07:47.430,01:07:51.740
"I have to make beta to
be independent of q.",01:07:51.740,01:07:54.940
"I have to make alpha
of f marriage with beta",01:07:54.940,01:07:58.120
to give me the potential.,01:07:58.120,01:08:00.870
OK?,01:08:00.870,01:08:02.440
"So essentially, what
happens is this.",01:08:02.440,01:08:06.240
I open this hole.,01:08:06.240,01:08:11.400
The gas starts to stream out.,01:08:11.400,01:08:15.120
"And then the particles will
collide with each other.",01:08:15.120,01:08:18.899
"The collision of particles
over some timescale that",01:08:18.899,01:08:21.910
"is related to this
collision time",01:08:21.910,01:08:24.470
"will randomize their momenta
so that locally, suddenly,",01:08:24.470,01:08:30.470
I have a solution such as this.,01:08:30.470,01:08:35.420
"But then the left-hand side
of the Boltzmann equation",01:08:35.420,01:08:39.859
takes over.,01:08:39.859,01:08:41.440
"And over a timescale
that is much longer,",01:08:41.440,01:08:44.220
"it will then change
the parameters of this.",01:08:44.220,01:08:47.740
"So basically, these
parameters should really",01:08:47.740,01:08:51.109
"be thought of as functions of
time, whose evolution changes.",01:08:51.109,01:08:56.210
"So initially, maybe
locally over here,",01:08:56.210,01:09:00.479
"there is a stream velocity
that goes towards the right.",01:09:00.479,01:09:04.080
"So I should have an
average at that time that",01:09:04.080,01:09:07.220
prefers to go to the right.,01:09:07.220,01:09:09.210
I wait sufficiently long.,01:09:09.210,01:09:11.049
"Presumably, the whole
thing comes to equilibrium.",01:09:11.049,01:09:13.090
"And that average goes
to 0 [INAUDIBLE].",01:09:13.090,01:09:16.120
"So presumably, the
next thing that I",01:09:16.120,01:09:18.790
"need to do in order to
answer the question,",01:09:18.790,01:09:22.020
"how does this thing
come to equilibrium,",01:09:22.020,01:09:24.439
"is to find out how the
left-hand side of the equation",01:09:24.439,01:09:29.510
"manipulates these parameters
alpha, beta, and pi.",01:09:29.510,01:09:33.819
"But that's not quite
consistent either.",01:09:33.819,01:09:36.910
"Because I first assume that
the right-hand side is 0,",01:09:36.910,01:09:40.620
"and then said, oh, that's
not a good solution.",01:09:40.620,01:09:43.569
"Let's go and see what
the left-hand side does.",01:09:43.569,01:09:46.300
"But then if the left-hand
side is changing things,",01:09:46.300,01:09:49.120
"I can't be over here
where dH by dt is 0.",01:09:49.120,01:09:53.279
"So I have not done
things consistently yet,",01:09:53.279,01:09:56.240
"although I have clearly
captured the whole lot of what",01:09:56.240,01:09:59.480
I want to describe eventually.,01:09:59.480,01:10:02.620
OK?,01:10:02.620,01:10:03.600
"So let's see how we can
do it systematically.",01:10:03.600,01:10:05.971
AUDIENCE: Question.,01:10:05.971,01:10:06.762
PROFESSOR: Yes.,01:10:06.762,01:10:07.600
"AUDIENCE: When you [? write ?]
the condition for [INAUDIBLE],",01:10:07.600,01:10:13.420
"[? did you ?] write
f1 of Hamiltonian.",01:10:13.420,01:10:15.845
"And ends up
Hamiltonian [INAUDIBLE]",01:10:15.845,01:10:17.785
includes interaction terms.,01:10:17.785,01:10:19.105
"PROFESSOR: It's the
one-particle Hamiltonian.",01:10:19.105,01:10:20.980
AUDIENCE: Oh.,01:10:20.980,01:10:21.924
PROFESSOR: Right.,01:10:21.924,01:10:22.870
"So by the time I got to the
equation for f1, I have H1.",01:10:22.870,01:10:27.840
"H1 does not have a second
particle in it to collide with.",01:10:27.840,01:10:31.490
OK?,01:10:36.290,01:10:39.105
"AUDIENCE: Then equilibrium
system's distribution",01:10:39.105,01:10:42.360
"of particles in
container does not",01:10:42.360,01:10:44.760
"depend on their interactions
after the [INAUDIBLE]?",01:10:44.760,01:10:50.418
"PROFESSOR: In the story that
we are following here, yes, it",01:10:50.418,01:10:53.681
does not.,01:10:53.681,01:10:54.180
"So this is an
approximation that actually",01:10:54.180,01:10:57.810
"goes with the
approximations that we",01:10:57.810,01:11:00.680
"made in neglecting some of the
higher order terms, with nd",01:11:00.680,01:11:04.410
"cubed being much
less than 1, and not",01:11:04.410,01:11:07.310
"looking at things at resolution
that is of the order of d.",01:11:07.310,01:11:10.710
"And we would imagine that it
is only at the resolutions--",01:11:10.710,01:11:13.740
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] neglected
[INAUDIBLE] atomized gas",01:11:13.740,01:11:17.930
conjoined onto the molecules.,01:11:17.930,01:11:19.842
Something like that.,01:11:19.842,01:11:20.798
"PROFESSOR: That would require
a different description.",01:11:20.798,01:11:23.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,01:11:23.830,01:11:24.658
It would require [INAUDIBLE].,01:11:24.658,01:11:25.486
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,01:11:25.486,01:11:26.152
So indeed.,01:11:26.152,01:11:27.080
"Eventually, in the description
that we are going to get,",01:11:27.080,01:11:30.910
"we are looking at
the distribution",01:11:30.910,01:11:33.400
"that would be appropriate
to a dilute gas",01:11:33.400,01:11:35.720
"and which interactions
are not seen.",01:11:35.720,01:11:38.251
OK?,01:11:41.620,01:11:43.800
All right.,01:11:43.800,01:11:44.300
"So let's see how we
can do it better.",01:11:44.300,01:11:46.220
"So clearly, the
key to the process",01:11:46.220,01:11:49.170
"is that collisions that take
place frequently at timescale",01:11:49.170,01:11:56.620
tau x randomize a lot of things.,01:11:56.620,01:12:00.240
"But they cannot randomize
quantities that are conserved",01:12:00.240,01:12:06.790
in collisions.,01:12:06.790,01:12:07.870
"So those are the quantities
that we have to look at.",01:12:07.870,01:12:11.057
"And again, these are
quantities that are conserved",01:12:11.057,01:12:13.140
"in collision, as
opposed to quantities",01:12:13.140,01:12:16.060
"that are conserved
according to H1.",01:12:16.060,01:12:20.270
"Like, momentum is
conserved in the collision.",01:12:20.270,01:12:24.390
"Clearly, momentum
was not conserved",01:12:24.390,01:12:26.720
"in H1 because of
the size of the box",01:12:26.720,01:12:30.400
"and did not appear in
the eventual solution.",01:12:30.400,01:12:34.400
OK.,01:12:34.400,01:12:35.340
Let's see what we get.,01:12:35.340,01:12:36.797
"So we are going to make
a couple of definitions.",01:12:47.030,01:12:51.100
"First, we define
a local density.",01:12:51.100,01:12:53.495
"I say that I take my solution
to Boltzmann equation.",01:13:01.000,01:13:04.560
And now I don't know what it is.,01:13:04.560,01:13:06.170
"But whatever it is,
I take the solution",01:13:06.170,01:13:09.070
"to the Boltzmann equation as
a function of p and q and t.",01:13:09.070,01:13:12.520
"But all I am interested is,
at this particular location,",01:13:12.520,01:13:16.120
"have the particles arrived
yet, what's the density.",01:13:16.120,01:13:19.400
"So to get that, I
essentially integrate",01:13:19.400,01:13:24.720
"over the momenta, which is
the quantity that I am not",01:13:24.720,01:13:27.760
interested.,01:13:27.760,01:13:30.390
OK?,01:13:30.390,01:13:30.890
Obvious.,01:13:30.890,01:13:33.050
"I define-- maybe I need
the average kinetic energy",01:13:33.050,01:13:37.160
at that location.,01:13:37.160,01:13:38.810
"So maybe, in general, I need the
average or some other quantity",01:13:38.810,01:13:44.520
"that I define at
location q and t.",01:13:44.520,01:13:46.860
"What I do is I integrate at that
position f of p, and q, and t,",01:13:51.990,01:14:03.830
"and this function O. Actually,
I also define a normalization.",01:14:03.830,01:14:11.510
I divide by n of q and t.,01:14:11.510,01:14:17.420
OK?,01:14:17.420,01:14:17.920
"Now, I implicitly used
something over there",01:14:22.820,01:14:26.090
"that, again, I
define here, which",01:14:26.090,01:14:29.180
"is a collision-conserved
quantity,",01:14:29.180,01:14:43.620
"is some function of momentum--
I could put q also--",01:14:43.620,01:14:54.320
"such that when evaluated for
p1 plus p2 for any pair of p1's",01:14:54.320,01:15:03.020
"and p2's that I take is the
same thing as when evaluated",01:15:03.020,01:15:08.630
"for functions of p1 and
p2 that would correspond",01:15:08.630,01:15:13.120
"to the outcomes of
the collision from",01:15:13.120,01:15:18.990
"or giving rights to p1, p2.",01:15:18.990,01:15:22.070
OK?,01:15:22.070,01:15:22.570
"And then there's a
following theorem",01:15:26.510,01:15:28.420
"that we were going
to use, which is",01:15:28.420,01:15:31.130
"that for any collision-conserved
quantity, what I have is",01:15:31.130,01:15:40.800
"that I will define a quantity J,
which is a function of q and t",01:15:40.800,01:15:46.645
"in principle, which is
obtained by integrating",01:15:46.645,01:15:53.000
over all momenta.,01:15:53.000,01:15:57.830
"Chi-- let's say,
evaluated at p1;",01:15:57.830,01:16:02.915
"it could be evaluated at q--
times this collision operator--",01:16:02.915,01:16:10.360
"C of f, f.",01:16:10.360,01:16:14.775
"And the answer is that for any
collision-conserved quantity,",01:16:21.550,01:16:25.680
"if you were to evaluate
this, the answer would be 0.",01:16:25.680,01:16:31.175
OK?,01:16:31.175,01:16:33.460
So let's write that down.,01:16:33.460,01:16:37.610
"So J of q and t is an integral
over some momentum p1.",01:16:37.610,01:16:44.500
"Because of the collision
integral, what do I have?",01:16:47.350,01:16:50.396
"I have the integration
over momentum.",01:16:50.396,01:16:53.450
I have the integration over b.,01:16:53.450,01:16:56.430
"I have the relative
velocity v2 minus v1.",01:16:56.430,01:17:01.480
"And then I have the
subtraction of interaction",01:17:01.480,01:17:06.420
"between p1 and p2--
addition of the interactions",01:17:06.420,01:17:11.320
"between p1 prime, p2 prime.",01:17:11.320,01:17:15.310
"And this collision
integral has to be",01:17:15.310,01:17:19.380
"multiplied with chi
evaluated at p1.",01:17:19.380,01:17:23.150
OK?,01:17:26.150,01:17:28.390
Fine.,01:17:28.390,01:17:28.890
"So then I will follow
exactly the steps",01:17:32.200,01:17:37.470
"that we had in the
proof of the H theorem.",01:17:37.470,01:17:42.720
"I have some function
that only depends",01:17:42.720,01:17:45.360
"on one of four momenta
that are appearing here.",01:17:45.360,01:17:49.900
And I want to symmetrize it.,01:17:49.900,01:17:52.500
"So I change the
index one to two.",01:17:52.500,01:17:58.590
"So this becomes 1/2 of
chi of p1 plus chi of p2.",01:17:58.590,01:18:05.510
"I do this transition between
primed and un-primed.",01:18:10.510,01:18:14.670
"And when I do that, I pick
this additional factor",01:18:14.670,01:18:18.940
"of minus chi of p1
prime, chi of p2 prime.",01:18:18.940,01:18:26.808
"And this becomes
division by 2 times 2.",01:18:26.808,01:18:32.030
"But then I stated that chi is
a collision-conserved quantity,",01:18:36.690,01:18:42.210
"so that this term in the
bracket is 0 for each point",01:18:42.210,01:18:48.360
that I'm integrating.,01:18:48.360,01:18:49.610
"And hence, the answer is 0.",01:18:49.610,01:18:51.130
Yes.,01:18:54.630,01:18:55.630
"AUDIENCE: In the
[INAUDIBLE] theorem,",01:18:55.630,01:18:59.130
"in the second
[INAUDIBLE], do you",01:18:59.130,01:19:05.252
want to put minus sign of the--?,01:19:05.252,01:19:10.686
"PROFESSOR: There
was a minus sign",01:19:10.686,01:19:13.410
worry that I had somewhere.,01:19:13.410,01:19:15.772
"AUDIENCE: I think in front
of 1/2, at the right term.",01:19:15.772,01:19:22.660
"PROFESSOR: In front of
the 1/2, minus f of p1.",01:19:22.660,01:19:27.040
You say I have to do this?,01:19:27.040,01:19:28.580
"AUDIENCE: No, no, no.",01:19:28.580,01:19:29.568
The next term.,01:19:29.568,01:19:31.544
PROFESSOR: Here?,01:19:34.508,01:19:35.496
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,01:19:35.496,01:19:36.154
"I mean, if you put minus
sign in front of the 1/2,",01:19:36.154,01:19:41.918
then [INAUDIBLE]?,01:19:41.918,01:19:43.894
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:19:48.834,01:19:49.610
"Let's put a question
mark here, because I",01:19:49.610,01:19:53.830
don't want to go over that.,01:19:53.830,01:19:55.997
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but you switched",01:19:55.997,01:19:57.580
"the order of the
subtraction [? 1/2. ?]",01:19:57.580,01:20:00.310
So it's minus [INAUDIBLE].,01:20:00.310,01:20:01.620
"PROFESSOR: But I changed
also the arguments here.",01:20:01.620,01:20:03.950
"AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.",01:20:03.950,01:20:05.202
PROFESSOR: Right?,01:20:05.202,01:20:05.910
So there is some issue.,01:20:05.910,01:20:07.545
"But this eventual
thing is correct.",01:20:07.545,01:20:12.830
So we will go back to that.,01:20:12.830,01:20:16.271
OK.,01:20:16.271,01:20:16.770
"So what is the use
of stating that",01:20:19.300,01:20:25.020
"for every conserved
quantity, you have this?",01:20:25.020,01:20:29.040
"It will allow us
to get equations",01:20:29.040,01:20:33.020
"that will determine how
these parameters change",01:20:33.020,01:20:36.820
as a function of time?,01:20:36.820,01:20:39.190
OK.,01:20:39.190,01:20:39.690
So let's see how that goes.,01:20:39.690,01:20:41.251
"If then I have
that Lf is C, f, f,",01:20:51.750,01:20:57.530
"and I showed that the integral
of chi against C, f, f is 0,",01:20:57.530,01:21:04.130
"then I also know
that the integral",01:21:04.130,01:21:07.690
"of chi against this
L operator on f is 0.",01:21:07.690,01:21:23.971
OK?,01:21:23.971,01:21:24.470
"And let's remind you
that the L operator is",01:21:24.470,01:21:27.550
"a bunch of first derivatives--
d by dt, d by dq, d by dp.",01:21:27.550,01:21:32.460
"And so I can use the
following result.",01:21:32.460,01:21:36.790
"I can write the result as this
derivative acting on both chi",01:21:36.790,01:21:41.460
and f.,01:21:41.460,01:21:42.890
"And then I will get chi
prime f plus f chi prime.",01:21:42.890,01:21:46.755
"Chi f prime I have, so I have
to subtract fL acting on chi.",01:21:46.755,01:21:54.220
OK?,01:21:58.950,01:22:00.850
And proceeding a little bit.,01:22:00.850,01:22:08.640
One more line maybe.,01:22:08.640,01:22:10.260
d cubed p.,01:22:10.260,01:22:12.390
