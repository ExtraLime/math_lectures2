"In this segment we introduce a
simple but powerful tool, the",00:00:00.590,00:00:05.150
"basic counting principle, which
we will be using over",00:00:05.150,00:00:08.450
"and over to deal with
counting problems.",00:00:08.450,00:00:11.820
"Let me describe the idea through
a simple example.",00:00:11.820,00:00:15.070
"You wake up in the morning and
you find that you have in your",00:00:15.070,00:00:18.380
"closet 4 shirts, 3 ties,
and 2 jackets.",00:00:18.380,00:00:23.120
"In how many different ways can
you get dressed today?",00:00:23.120,00:00:27.000
"To answer this question, let
us think of the process of",00:00:27.000,00:00:30.580
"getting dressed as consisting of
three steps, three stages.",00:00:30.580,00:00:36.220
"You first choose a shirt, let's
say this one, and you",00:00:36.220,00:00:40.910
have 4 choices of shirts.,00:00:40.910,00:00:44.600
"But each shirt can be used
together with 1 of the 3",00:00:44.600,00:00:50.600
"available ties to make
3 different shirt-tie",00:00:50.600,00:00:55.710
combinations.,00:00:55.710,00:00:58.520
"But since we had 4 choices for
the shirt, this means that we",00:00:58.520,00:01:03.540
"have 4 times 3, equals 12,
shirt-tie combinations.",00:01:03.540,00:01:09.970
"Finally, you choose a jacket.",00:01:09.970,00:01:12.160
"Each shirt-tie combination can
go together with either",00:01:12.160,00:01:15.240
"jacket, and so the fact that you
have 2 jackets available",00:01:15.240,00:01:19.400
"doubles the number of options
that you have, leading to 24",00:01:19.400,00:01:25.320
different options overall.,00:01:25.320,00:01:27.340
"So 24 is the answer to
this simple problem.",00:01:27.340,00:01:31.190
"And how did the number
24 come about?",00:01:31.190,00:01:33.530
"Well, 24 is the same as the
number of options you had in",00:01:33.530,00:01:37.420
"the first stage times the number
of options you had in",00:01:37.420,00:01:40.009
"the second stage times the
number of options you had in",00:01:40.009,00:01:43.530
the third stage.,00:01:43.530,00:01:45.539
Let us generalize.,00:01:45.539,00:01:48.610
"Suppose we want to construct
some kind of object, and we're",00:01:48.610,00:01:51.840
"going to construct it through a
sequential process, through",00:01:51.840,00:01:55.110
"a sequence of r different
stages.",00:01:55.110,00:01:58.890
"In the example that we just
considered, the number of",00:01:58.890,00:02:02.140
stages was equal to 3.,00:02:02.140,00:02:05.600
"At each one of the stages, you
have a number of options that",00:02:05.600,00:02:09.600
are available.,00:02:09.600,00:02:10.699
"So in our example, at the first
stage we had 4 options,",00:02:10.699,00:02:14.500
"at the second stage we had 3
options, and at the last stage",00:02:14.500,00:02:19.270
we had 2 options.,00:02:19.270,00:02:21.990
"What is important is that when
you reach stage i, no matter",00:02:21.990,00:02:27.930
"what you chose, no matter what
you did at the previous",00:02:27.930,00:02:31.430
"stages, the number of options
that you will have available",00:02:31.430,00:02:35.329
"at stage i is going to be that
fixed number, n-sub-i.",00:02:35.329,00:02:42.180
So what is the answer?,00:02:42.180,00:02:44.200
"How many different objects can
you construct this way?",00:02:44.200,00:02:47.500
"Well, just generalizing from
what we did in our specific",00:02:47.500,00:02:50.950
"example, the answer is the
product of the number of",00:02:50.950,00:02:56.500
"choices or options that
you had at each stage.",00:02:56.500,00:03:02.950
"This is the counting
principle.",00:03:02.950,00:03:05.240
"It's a very simple idea,
but it is powerful.",00:03:05.240,00:03:08.740
"It will allow us
to solve fairly",00:03:08.740,00:03:11.140
complicated counting problems.,00:03:11.140,00:03:13.790
"However, before we go into more
complicated problems, let",00:03:13.790,00:03:17.990
"us first deal with a few
relatively easy examples.",00:03:17.990,00:03:21.760
"In our first example, let us
consider license plates that",00:03:26.300,00:03:31.660
"consist of 2 letters followed
by 3 digits.",00:03:31.660,00:03:35.240
"The question is, how
many different",00:03:35.240,00:03:37.320
license plates are there?,00:03:37.320,00:03:39.620
"We think of the process of
constructing a license plate",00:03:39.620,00:03:43.250
as a sequential process.,00:03:43.250,00:03:45.130
"At the first stage we choose a
letter, and we have 26 choices",00:03:45.130,00:03:51.700
for the first letter.,00:03:51.700,00:03:53.460
"Then we need to choose the
second letter, and we have 26",00:03:53.460,00:03:57.690
choices for that one.,00:03:57.690,00:03:59.700
"Then we choose the
first digit.",00:03:59.700,00:04:01.210
We have 10 choices for it.,00:04:01.210,00:04:03.160
"We choose the second digit, for
which we have 10 choices.",00:04:03.160,00:04:06.870
"And finally, we choose the last
digit, for which we also",00:04:06.870,00:04:09.460
have 10 choices.,00:04:09.460,00:04:10.790
"So if you multiply these
numbers, you can find the",00:04:10.790,00:04:13.880
"number of different license
plates that you can make with",00:04:13.880,00:04:16.560
"2 letters followed
by 3 digits.",00:04:16.560,00:04:18.930
"Now let us change the problem a
little bit and require that",00:04:18.930,00:04:23.540
"no letter and no digit can
be used more than once.",00:04:23.540,00:04:28.775
"So, let us think of a process
by which we could construct",00:04:31.300,00:04:35.960
license plates of this kind.,00:04:35.960,00:04:38.580
"In the first stage, we choose
the first letter that goes to",00:04:38.580,00:04:44.480
"the license plate, and
we have 26 choices.",00:04:44.480,00:04:48.450
"Now, let us go into a second
stage where we choose the",00:04:48.450,00:04:51.620
second letter.,00:04:51.620,00:04:54.070
"Because we used 1 letter in the
first stage, this means",00:04:54.070,00:04:57.930
"that there's only 25 available
letters that can be used.",00:04:57.930,00:05:02.690
"We only have 25 choices
at the second stage.",00:05:02.690,00:05:06.900
"Now, let us start dealing
with the digits.",00:05:06.900,00:05:08.790
"We choose the first digit, and
we have 10 choices for it.",00:05:08.790,00:05:12.530
"However, when we go and choose
the next digit we will only",00:05:12.530,00:05:17.400
"have 9 choices, because
1 of the digits has",00:05:17.400,00:05:20.780
already been used.,00:05:20.780,00:05:22.620
"At this point, 2 digits have
been used, which means that at",00:05:22.620,00:05:26.450
"the last stage we have only
8 digits to choose from.",00:05:26.450,00:05:30.630
"So by multiplying these numbers,
we can find out the",00:05:30.630,00:05:34.590
"answer to this question, the
number of license plates if",00:05:34.590,00:05:37.590
repetition is prohibited.,00:05:37.590,00:05:40.860
"Let us now consider a
different example.",00:05:40.860,00:05:43.830
"Suppose that we start
with a set that",00:05:46.450,00:05:49.450
consists of n elements.,00:05:49.450,00:05:51.710
"What we want to do is
to take these n",00:05:54.540,00:05:57.130
elements and order them.,00:05:57.130,00:06:00.230
"A terminology that's often used
here is that we want to",00:06:00.230,00:06:03.650
"form a permutation of
these n elements.",00:06:03.650,00:06:07.290
"One way of visualizing
permutations is to say that",00:06:07.290,00:06:11.850
"we're going to take these
elements of the set, which are",00:06:11.850,00:06:14.720
"unordered, and we're
going to place them",00:06:14.720,00:06:18.010
in a sequence slots.,00:06:18.010,00:06:20.590
So we create n slots.,00:06:20.590,00:06:23.030
"And we want to put each one of
these elements into one of",00:06:26.390,00:06:31.750
these slots.,00:06:31.750,00:06:33.500
How do we go about it?,00:06:33.500,00:06:36.350
"We think of putting the
elements into slots,",00:06:36.350,00:06:39.760
one slot at a time.,00:06:39.760,00:06:41.890
"We first consider
the first slot.",00:06:41.890,00:06:44.350
"We pick one of the elements
and put it there.",00:06:44.350,00:06:48.740
"How many choices do we
have at this stage?",00:06:48.740,00:06:50.820
"We have n choices, because we
can pick any of the available",00:06:50.820,00:06:54.260
"elements and place
it in that slot.",00:06:54.260,00:06:56.930
"Next, we pick another
element and put it",00:06:56.930,00:07:00.420
inside the second slot.,00:07:00.420,00:07:02.380
"How many choices do we
have at this step?",00:07:02.380,00:07:04.765
"Well, we have already used one
of the available elements,",00:07:04.765,00:07:10.180
"which means that there's n minus
1 elements to choose",00:07:10.180,00:07:13.280
from at the next stage.,00:07:13.280,00:07:17.160
"At this point, we have used
2 of the elements.",00:07:17.160,00:07:20.190
"There is n minus 2
that are left.",00:07:20.190,00:07:24.120
"We pick one of them and put it
in the third slot, and we have",00:07:24.120,00:07:30.100
"n minus 2 choices
at this point.",00:07:30.100,00:07:33.080
We continue this way.,00:07:33.080,00:07:34.580
We keep going on.,00:07:34.580,00:07:36.230
"At some point we have placed
n minus 1 of the",00:07:36.230,00:07:39.640
elements into slots.,00:07:39.640,00:07:41.090
"There's only one element left,
and that element, necessarily,",00:07:41.090,00:07:44.730
will get into the last slot.,00:07:44.730,00:07:47.610
"There are no choices to
be made at this point.",00:07:47.610,00:07:50.730
"So the overall number of ways
that we can carry out this",00:07:50.730,00:07:57.500
"process, put the elements into
the n slots, by the counting",00:07:57.500,00:08:01.160
"principle is going to be the
product of the number of",00:08:01.160,00:08:04.510
"choices that we had at each
one of the stages.",00:08:04.510,00:08:09.870
"So it's the product of the
numbers n, n minus 1, n minus",00:08:09.870,00:08:13.710
"2, all the way down to 1.",00:08:13.710,00:08:17.660
"And this product we denote as a
shorthand this way, which we",00:08:17.660,00:08:24.430
read as n factorial.,00:08:24.430,00:08:26.300
"n factorial is the product of
all integers from 1 all the",00:08:26.300,00:08:31.100
way up to n.,00:08:31.100,00:08:32.799
"And in particular, the number of
permutations of n elements",00:08:32.799,00:08:37.640
is equal to n factorial.,00:08:37.640,00:08:40.900
"Let us now consider
another example.",00:08:40.900,00:08:44.039
"We start again with a
general set, which",00:08:44.039,00:08:48.460
consists of n elements.,00:08:48.460,00:08:51.500
"And we're interested
in constructing a",00:08:51.500,00:08:55.120
subset of that set.,00:08:55.120,00:08:56.880
"In how many different
ways can we do that?",00:08:59.472,00:09:02.350
"How many different subsets
are there?",00:09:02.350,00:09:06.540
"Let us think of a sequential
process through which we can",00:09:06.540,00:09:09.700
choose the subset.,00:09:09.700,00:09:11.040
"The sequential process proceeds
by considering each",00:09:11.040,00:09:14.580
"one of the elements of our
set, one at a time.",00:09:14.580,00:09:18.640
"We first consider the
first element, and",00:09:18.640,00:09:20.750
here we have 2 choices.,00:09:20.750,00:09:22.650
"Do we put it inside
the set or not?",00:09:22.650,00:09:27.090
"So 2 choices for the
first element.",00:09:27.090,00:09:29.260
"Then we consider the
second element.",00:09:29.260,00:09:31.600
"Again, we have 2 choices.",00:09:31.600,00:09:32.990
"Do we put it in the
subset or not?",00:09:32.990,00:09:36.910
"We continue this way until we
consider all the elements.",00:09:36.910,00:09:42.770
There's n of them.,00:09:42.770,00:09:45.020
"And the overall number of
choices that we have is the",00:09:45.020,00:09:48.020
"product of 2 times 2 times
2, n times, which is 2",00:09:48.020,00:09:53.520
to the power n.,00:09:53.520,00:09:56.620
"At this point, we can also do
a sanity check to make sure",00:09:56.620,00:09:59.760
that our answer is correct.,00:09:59.760,00:10:02.320
"Let us consider the simple and
special case where n is equal",00:10:02.320,00:10:07.770
"to 1, which means we're starting
with this set with 1",00:10:07.770,00:10:12.270
"element, and we want to
find the number of",00:10:12.270,00:10:14.650
subsets that it has.,00:10:14.650,00:10:16.320
"According to the answer that we
derived, this should have 2",00:10:16.320,00:10:20.820
"to the first, that
is 2 subsets.",00:10:20.820,00:10:24.740
Which ones are they?,00:10:24.740,00:10:26.830
"One subset of this set is the
set itself and the other",00:10:26.830,00:10:33.160
subset is the empty set.,00:10:33.160,00:10:36.090
"So we do have, indeed, 2 subsets
out of that set, which",00:10:36.090,00:10:39.720
"agrees with the answer
that we found.",00:10:39.720,00:10:42.600
"Notice that when we count
subsets of a given set, we",00:10:42.600,00:10:47.460
"count both the set itself, the
whole set, and we also count",00:10:47.460,00:10:52.720
the empty set.,00:10:52.720,00:10:53.630
"All of these are subsets
of our set.",00:10:53.630,00:10:56.420
"At this point, we can now
pause and you can try to",00:10:58.960,00:11:03.430
"answer some simple questions of
the same kind as the ones",00:11:03.430,00:11:07.290
that we just practiced.,00:11:07.290,00:11:08.600
