"PROFESSOR: So I'll
briefly review",00:00:20.475,00:00:21.850
what we were doing last time.,00:00:21.850,00:00:24.560
"We are gradually
developing the structure",00:00:24.560,00:00:28.747
that we need for thermodynamics.,00:00:28.747,00:00:30.080
"And the first thing that we
did was to state that it wholly",00:00:33.870,00:00:40.730
"depends on the existence
of equilibrim--",00:00:40.730,00:00:46.070
"is the first and foremost
thing that we need to know,",00:00:46.070,00:00:50.460
"is that the objects that we
are studying in thermodynamics",00:00:50.460,00:00:54.590
are in equilibrium.,00:00:54.590,00:00:56.180
"And once they're
in equilibrium, we",00:00:56.180,00:00:58.370
"can characterize them
by a set of properties.",00:00:58.370,00:01:01.310
"So there's a list of
coordinates that I",00:01:01.310,00:01:03.330
would have the list here.,00:01:03.330,00:01:05.160
"And we saw that
since we will also",00:01:05.160,00:01:09.460
"need to think in terms of
mechanical work, a good place",00:01:09.460,00:01:13.690
"to start-- and since we are
familiar with mechanical",00:01:13.690,00:01:16.420
"coordinates-- is to enumerate
here the mechanical coordinates",00:01:16.420,00:01:21.480
"that we would describe
the system with.",00:01:21.480,00:01:23.730
"And we said that we could,
in principal, characterize",00:01:23.730,00:01:29.080
"or divide those
coordinates in the form",00:01:29.080,00:01:31.910
"of some generalized
displacements",00:01:31.910,00:01:37.750
"and the corresponding
conjugate forces.",00:01:37.750,00:01:41.910
"And typically, the displacements
are extensive proportional",00:01:41.910,00:01:46.960
to the size of your system.,00:01:46.960,00:01:48.320
The forces are intensive.,00:01:48.320,00:01:50.280
"And the work is related to
the product of those two",00:01:50.280,00:01:53.330
in some fashion.,00:01:53.330,00:01:55.600
"One of the things that
I will do throughout",00:01:55.600,00:01:58.340
"is to emphasize that one of
the main materials that we",00:01:58.340,00:02:03.010
"are going to look at, and
illustrate the concept with,",00:02:03.010,00:02:07.960
is the gas.,00:02:07.960,00:02:08.585
"And in particular,
the version of the gas",00:02:08.585,00:02:12.220
that is the ideal gas.,00:02:12.220,00:02:14.330
"But forgetting the ideal
part for the time being,",00:02:14.330,00:02:17.120
"the coordinates that we use
to describe the gas with",00:02:17.120,00:02:21.060
is V and pressure.,00:02:21.060,00:02:24.330
"And actually, we
saw that in order",00:02:24.330,00:02:26.360
"to ultimately be consistent
with how we will define work,",00:02:26.360,00:02:30.830
"it is good to think
of minus pressure",00:02:30.830,00:02:34.670
as the appropriate force.,00:02:34.670,00:02:37.110
"And so basically, then if I want
to characterize the equilibrium",00:02:37.110,00:02:42.960
"state of a gas, I
need, for example,",00:02:42.960,00:02:47.940
"to specify where I
lie in this P-V plane.",00:02:47.940,00:02:53.670
"OK so that's the
first thing to know.",00:02:53.670,00:02:57.230
"But then we also realize
that mechanical coordinates",00:02:57.230,00:03:01.280
"are insufficient to describe
the properties of the systems",00:03:01.280,00:03:04.880
that we encounter.,00:03:04.880,00:03:06.480
"For example, if we are
thinking in terms of a spring",00:03:06.480,00:03:10.110
"and we pull on
the spring-- so we",00:03:10.110,00:03:11.980
"are looking at the relationship
between displacement",00:03:11.980,00:03:15.220
"and the force-- the result
that we get how easy it",00:03:15.220,00:03:18.060
"is to pull on this depends
on something else--",00:03:18.060,00:03:21.830
depends on temperature.,00:03:21.830,00:03:23.640
"So somehow, we need to
include these properties that",00:03:23.640,00:03:28.460
"have to do with heat
and heat transfer",00:03:28.460,00:03:31.690
"in order to have a complete
description of systems",00:03:31.690,00:03:34.400
that are in equilibrium.,00:03:34.400,00:03:36.160
"And so going along
that direction,",00:03:36.160,00:03:38.460
we started with the Zeroth Law.,00:03:38.460,00:03:42.370
"And the statement
of the Zeroth Law",00:03:42.370,00:03:44.050
"was the transitivity
of equilibrium--",00:03:44.050,00:03:46.440
"if two objects
are in equilibrium",00:03:46.440,00:03:48.170
"with each other they are--
two objects are in equilibrium",00:03:48.170,00:03:52.310
"with a third object,
they're also in equilibrium",00:03:52.310,00:03:54.690
with each other.,00:03:54.690,00:03:56.250
"And we saw that
what that means, is",00:03:56.250,00:03:59.270
"that once I am at some point
in this coordinate space,",00:03:59.270,00:04:03.170
"I know that there
exists some function.",00:04:03.170,00:04:05.210
"I don't know its
functional form.",00:04:05.210,00:04:07.930
"This empirical temperature
and being in equilibrium",00:04:07.930,00:04:11.730
"means that there is
this important function",00:04:11.730,00:04:16.260
"of the coordinates
of the first system",00:04:16.260,00:04:19.810
"equal to some other functional
or form potentially,",00:04:19.810,00:04:23.510
"depending on the coordinates
of the second system.",00:04:23.510,00:04:27.130
"And this empirical temperature
has to be the same.",00:04:27.130,00:04:33.650
"We said that this is kind
of like being on a scale,",00:04:33.650,00:04:37.490
"and having a balance
between different things,",00:04:37.490,00:04:40.740
"and then they are in
balance with each other.",00:04:40.740,00:04:43.230
"So we know that there's
something like mass.",00:04:43.230,00:04:46.800
"Now, when we describe this
in the context of the gas,",00:04:46.800,00:04:51.860
"we noted that for all gases in
the limit that they are dilute,",00:04:51.860,00:04:56.890
"the isotherms-- the places that
would correspond in this case",00:04:56.890,00:05:01.960
"to always being in
contact with the object",00:05:01.960,00:05:05.240
"is at a fixed temperature,
form these hyperboles.",00:05:05.240,00:05:09.620
"So the isotherms in
the limit of dilute",00:05:09.620,00:05:15.020
"are of the form PV is
proportional to time span.",00:05:15.020,00:05:18.925
We can call that theta.,00:05:21.900,00:05:24.170
"We can use that, even, to
define the ideal gas temperature",00:05:24.170,00:05:28.110
"scale, provided that we
choose some proportionality",00:05:28.110,00:05:32.450
"coefficient which
was selected so",00:05:32.450,00:05:34.880
"that the temperature
of water, ice,",00:05:34.880,00:05:37.910
"steam, coexistent at
a particular value.",00:05:37.910,00:05:42.330
"OK, so that's the specific
property of the ideal gas",00:05:42.330,00:05:46.370
"as far as its
temperature is concerned.",00:05:46.370,00:05:50.250
"The next thing that
we did was to look",00:05:50.250,00:05:56.830
"at how changes are carrying a
system, a particular system.",00:05:56.830,00:06:02.250
"And we found that if you take
the system from one location",00:06:02.250,00:06:07.710
"in its coordinate space
to another location,",00:06:07.710,00:06:12.190
"do it in a manner that does not
involve the exchange of heat.",00:06:12.190,00:06:17.730
"So basically, you
idealize this thing",00:06:17.730,00:06:20.170
"and isolate it from
any other source--",00:06:20.170,00:06:24.390
"that the amount of
work-- and we can then",00:06:24.390,00:06:26.370
"calculate mechanical work--
the amount of mechanical work",00:06:26.370,00:06:29.180
"that you do is only a function
of the initial and final",00:06:29.180,00:06:32.640
"states, and does
not depend on how",00:06:32.640,00:06:35.890
"you supply the work that
produces this, et cetera.",00:06:35.890,00:06:42.020
"And so that immediately reminded
us of conservation of energy,",00:06:42.020,00:06:47.390
"and a suggestion that there
exists this function that",00:06:47.390,00:06:54.710
"depends on where you are in this
coordinate representation that",00:06:54.710,00:07:00.720
"gives the total energy
content of the system.",00:07:00.720,00:07:04.900
"What was important
was that, of course,",00:07:04.900,00:07:08.630
"we want to relax the condition
of making changes over which",00:07:08.630,00:07:15.950
"there is no heat
exchange to the system.",00:07:15.950,00:07:19.880
"And more generally then,
we said that the changes",00:07:19.880,00:07:25.000
"that we obtain in energy are
the sum of the two components--",00:07:25.000,00:07:30.080
"the amount of work
that you do on it,",00:07:30.080,00:07:33.500
"and that we know how to measure
from our various mechanical",00:07:33.500,00:07:38.780
prescriptions.,00:07:38.780,00:07:40.490
"But if there is a shortcoming
from the internal energy",00:07:40.490,00:07:44.120
"function that we had
constructed previously,",00:07:44.120,00:07:47.940
"and the work that we compute
for a particular process,",00:07:47.940,00:07:51.320
"we say that in
that process, there",00:07:51.320,00:07:54.530
"was some heat that
went into the system.",00:07:54.530,00:07:57.930
"And it is, again,
important to state",00:07:57.930,00:08:00.640
"that this dE really only depends
on the initial and final state.",00:08:00.640,00:08:06.030
So this depends on state.,00:08:06.030,00:08:09.110
"While these things-- that's
why we put a bar on them--",00:08:09.110,00:08:12.620
"depend on the particular
path that we take.",00:08:12.620,00:08:15.290
"Now again, if you
ask, well, what can",00:08:21.790,00:08:24.400
"we say in this context
for the ideal gas?",00:08:24.400,00:08:28.040
"And there is the very
nice experiment by Joule",00:08:28.040,00:08:38.640
"where he said, let's
isolate our gas, let's say,",00:08:38.640,00:08:45.570
into two chambers.,00:08:45.570,00:08:48.830
"These are kind of rigid
balls, very nicely isolated",00:08:48.830,00:08:53.870
from the environment.,00:08:53.870,00:08:55.830
"Initially, the gas is confined
completely onto one side.",00:08:55.830,00:09:03.150
"So let's say that the
initial state is over here,",00:09:03.150,00:09:06.792
with this volume.,00:09:06.792,00:09:09.530
And then we release this.,00:09:09.530,00:09:12.670
And so the gas goes and expands.,00:09:12.670,00:09:16.010
And we wait sufficiently.,00:09:16.010,00:09:17.625
We wait sufficiently.,00:09:17.625,00:09:19.150
"Ultimately, we're
settled to a place,",00:09:19.150,00:09:21.650
"let's say over here--
the final state.",00:09:21.650,00:09:25.911
"Now, it's important
to say that I",00:09:25.911,00:09:29.090
"don't know the intermediate
state of this transformation.",00:09:29.090,00:09:33.520
"So I can't say that
somewhere between t",00:09:33.520,00:09:36.070
"equals to zero when
I open the valve,",00:09:36.070,00:09:38.380
"and t goes to infinity where
the whole thing is settled.",00:09:38.380,00:09:41.830
Zero and infinity points I know.,00:09:41.830,00:09:44.255
"In between, I can't
really have an idea",00:09:44.255,00:09:48.495
of where to put my system.,00:09:48.495,00:09:50.810
"It is at non-equilibrium
by construction.",00:09:50.810,00:09:54.780
"But this is a process
that by definition I",00:09:54.780,00:09:57.830
"follow the path
along which there",00:09:57.830,00:10:00.640
"was no input either in
the form of work or heat",00:10:00.640,00:10:05.790
into the system.,00:10:05.790,00:10:06.510
It was isolated.,00:10:06.510,00:10:08.300
"So all I know for sure is
that however amount of energy",00:10:08.300,00:10:11.470
"I had initially is
what I have finally.",00:10:11.470,00:10:15.200
"The observation of
Joule was that if we",00:10:15.200,00:10:18.790
"do this for the case
of a dilute gas,",00:10:18.790,00:10:22.160
"I start with some
initial temperature Ti.",00:10:22.160,00:10:25.760
I go to some final temperature.,00:10:25.760,00:10:28.080
"But that final
temperature is the same",00:10:28.080,00:10:30.600
as the initial temperature.,00:10:30.600,00:10:32.600
"And that is actually
why I put both",00:10:32.600,00:10:35.660
"of these points on
the same isotherm",00:10:35.660,00:10:39.390
that I had drawn before.,00:10:39.390,00:10:41.240
"So although I don't know
anything about the in",00:10:41.240,00:10:43.897
"between points, I know that this
is the property of the system.",00:10:43.897,00:10:48.890
"And essentially,
we know, therefore,",00:10:48.890,00:10:52.660
"that although in
principle I can write E",00:10:52.660,00:10:56.090
"as a function of
P and V, it must",00:10:56.090,00:10:58.960
"be only a function
of the product PV,",00:10:58.960,00:11:02.650
"because it only-- P
changes in the process.",00:11:02.650,00:11:05.790
V changes in the process.,00:11:05.790,00:11:07.270
But PV remains constant.,00:11:07.270,00:11:09.960
"Or if you like, E
is really a function",00:11:09.960,00:11:12.600
"of T, which is related
to the product.",00:11:12.600,00:11:16.180
"And sorry about being kind
of inconsistent with using T",00:11:16.180,00:11:21.900
and theta for temperature.,00:11:21.900,00:11:23.410
"OK, any questions?",00:11:26.200,00:11:28.430
"So this is kind of recap
of what we were doing.",00:11:28.430,00:11:33.160
"All right, now, it
would be good if we",00:11:33.160,00:11:36.820
"can construct this
function somehow--",00:11:36.820,00:11:39.370
"at least theoretically, even.",00:11:39.370,00:11:41.330
"And you would say, well,
if I had this spring,",00:11:41.330,00:11:45.410
"and I didn't know whether it
was a Hookean or a nonlinear",00:11:45.410,00:11:48.090
"spring, what I could do
is I could pull on it,",00:11:48.090,00:11:52.500
"calculate what the force
is, and the displacement,",00:11:52.500,00:11:55.770
"and integrate f dx and
use the formula that quite",00:11:55.770,00:12:01.450
"generally, the mechanical
work is sum over i,",00:12:01.450,00:12:07.670
let's say Ji dxi.,00:12:07.670,00:12:09.000
"Now, of course you
know that I can only",00:12:11.990,00:12:13.690
"do this if I pull
it on this spring",00:12:13.690,00:12:16.210
"sufficiently slowly, so
that the work that I do",00:12:16.210,00:12:20.150
"goes into changing the
internal energy of the spring.",00:12:20.150,00:12:24.010
"And then that would be
a contribution to dE.",00:12:24.010,00:12:27.150
"If I do that rapidly, then
it will send this spring",00:12:27.150,00:12:29.990
into oscillation.,00:12:29.990,00:12:31.040
"I have no idea, again,
where the system",00:12:31.040,00:12:36.730
is in the intermediate stages.,00:12:36.730,00:12:40.020
"So I can use this
kind of formula",00:12:40.020,00:12:43.780
"if, in this type of
diagram that indicates",00:12:43.780,00:12:47.760
"the state of the system, I
proceed sufficiently slowly",00:12:47.760,00:12:52.220
"so that I can put points
that corresponding",00:12:52.220,00:12:54.780
to all intermediate states.,00:12:54.780,00:12:57.120
"And so that's for things that
are sufficiently slow and close",00:12:57.120,00:13:04.340
"to equilibrium that
we call quasistatic.",00:13:04.340,00:13:08.500
"And so in principal, I guess
rather than opening this",00:13:12.230,00:13:16.430
"immediately, I could
have put a slow piston",00:13:16.430,00:13:21.600
"here, change its position
slowly, so that at each stage",00:13:21.600,00:13:25.110
"I can calculate where
I am on the PV diagram.",00:13:25.110,00:13:28.120
"And I could have calculated
what the work is, and used",00:13:28.120,00:13:32.660
"this formula to calculate
the contribution of the work",00:13:32.660,00:13:37.290
"to the change in
internal energy.",00:13:37.290,00:13:40.800
"OK, now I said that
it would be ideal--",00:13:40.800,00:13:46.930
"and what we would like
to do, ultimately--",00:13:46.930,00:13:50.070
"is to have a similar
formula for dQ.",00:13:50.070,00:13:56.524
"And if we look by analogy,
we see that for W,",00:13:56.524,00:14:05.030
you have J's times the X's.,00:14:05.030,00:14:07.440
"The forces are the
things that tell us",00:14:07.440,00:14:09.940
"whether systems are in
equilibrium with each other.",00:14:09.940,00:14:13.170
"So two-- if I have,
let's say, a piston",00:14:13.170,00:14:16.590
"separating two parts
of the gas, the piston",00:14:16.590,00:14:18.960
"will not move one
direction or the other",00:14:18.960,00:14:20.950
"if the pressure
from one direction",00:14:20.950,00:14:22.540
"is the same as the pressure
from the other direction.",00:14:22.540,00:14:25.550
"So mechanical equilibrium
tells us that J's are the same.",00:14:25.550,00:14:29.470
"And it suggests that
if I want to write",00:14:29.470,00:14:33.000
"a similar type of formula for
heat, that the thing that I",00:14:33.000,00:14:37.850
"should put here is temperature
or empirical temperature, which",00:14:37.850,00:14:41.980
"is, again, a measure
of thermal equilibrium.",00:14:41.980,00:14:45.490
"And then the question
that would immediately",00:14:45.490,00:14:48.700
"jump onto you is, what
is the conjugate that I",00:14:48.700,00:14:52.180
have put for the displacement?,00:14:52.180,00:14:54.880
"And you know
ultimately that it is",00:14:54.880,00:14:57.130
going to end up to be entropy.,00:14:57.130,00:14:59.360
"And so the next part of
the story is to build that.",00:14:59.360,00:15:03.940
"And we're going to do that
through the Second Law",00:15:03.940,00:15:08.349
of Thermodynamics.,00:15:08.349,00:15:09.098
Any questions?,00:15:15.930,00:15:18.130
Yes.,00:15:18.130,00:15:19.119
"AUDIENCE: I mean, this is
kind of a semantics question,",00:15:19.119,00:15:21.410
"but what always confuses
me in thermodynamics",00:15:21.410,00:15:24.130
"when we talk about quasistatic
is, I mean, if it isn't",00:15:24.130,00:15:27.780
"quasistatic, introductory
formation of [INAUDIBLE]",00:15:27.780,00:15:32.450
"doesn't really give a
means to address it.",00:15:32.450,00:15:34.770
"So we have to rely on the
fact that it's quasistatic.",00:15:34.770,00:15:38.250
"And the only way
we could check it",00:15:38.250,00:15:40.370
"is to assume that what
we're already saying is true",00:15:40.370,00:15:42.530
will be true.,00:15:42.530,00:15:43.970
"So I guess my question is,
in the context of a spring,",00:15:43.970,00:15:47.960
"like, there's
obviously-- there exists",00:15:47.960,00:15:50.130
"a physical threshold at which--
that's not infinitely slow,",00:15:50.130,00:15:54.374
"and which you can get a
reasonable measurement",00:15:54.374,00:15:56.290
if you're doing an experiment.,00:15:56.290,00:15:58.540
"PROFESSOR: So in
all of these things,",00:15:58.540,00:16:01.180
"I would sort of resort to some
kind of a limiting procedure.",00:16:01.180,00:16:06.360
"So you could, for example, pull
the spring at some velocity,",00:16:06.360,00:16:10.290
"and figure out what
the amount of work is,",00:16:10.290,00:16:12.910
"and gradually reduce
that velocity,",00:16:12.910,00:16:15.400
"and hope that the formula--
the values-- that you get",00:16:15.400,00:16:18.990
"are converging to something
as you go to low velocity.",00:16:18.990,00:16:22.610
"I don't think there's
actually a threshold velocity,",00:16:22.610,00:16:25.060
"kind of implied that if you
are slower than something, then",00:16:25.060,00:16:28.140
it would work.,00:16:28.140,00:16:29.290
"I think it really only works
in the limit of zero velocity.",00:16:29.290,00:16:32.910
"And so if you like,
that's kind of procedure",00:16:32.910,00:16:38.110
"you would use to define
derivatives, right?",00:16:38.110,00:16:40.480
"So you can't say what's the
meaning of velocity in physics.",00:16:40.480,00:16:44.800
"So, but it is an idealization.",00:16:49.780,00:16:51.580
"I said at the beginning
that the very-- actually, I",00:16:51.580,00:16:54.180
"would say that
more fundamentally,",00:16:54.180,00:16:55.930
"the thing that is
really an idealization",00:16:55.930,00:16:58.440
is this adiabatic walls.,00:16:58.440,00:17:00.690
"Even the concept
of equilibrium--",00:17:00.690,00:17:03.080
"what do we see around us
that we are absolutely",00:17:03.080,00:17:05.960
100% sure in equilibrium?,00:17:05.960,00:17:07.780
Nothing is.,00:17:07.780,00:17:08.970
"The fate of the universe is that
all of our atoms and molecules",00:17:08.970,00:17:12.339
"are going to separate out
and go to infinity, if it",00:17:12.339,00:17:15.599
expands forever.,00:17:15.599,00:17:16.495
Right?,00:17:16.495,00:17:16.994
"OK, Second Law--
all right, so again,",00:17:19.720,00:17:28.610
"we want to sort of
set our minds back",00:17:28.610,00:17:31.620
"to where these laws
were developed,",00:17:31.620,00:17:33.720
which is in the 18th century.,00:17:33.720,00:17:35.720
"And the thing that was of
importance at that time",00:17:35.720,00:17:42.510
"was sort of Industrial
Revolution-- get things moving.",00:17:42.510,00:17:46.440
"You need energy, and you
would get energy from coal,",00:17:46.440,00:17:50.390
"and so you need to
convert heat to work.",00:17:50.390,00:17:54.730
"And this conversion of heat
to work is important to you.",00:17:54.730,00:18:00.160
"So typical thing that you
have for your coal engine",00:18:00.160,00:18:07.440
"is you have something
that is a source of heat.",00:18:07.440,00:18:11.380
"So there's, for example, a
fire that you're burning.",00:18:11.380,00:18:16.090
"You have some kind
of a machine that",00:18:16.090,00:18:23.490
"has components, such as a
piston, that is being heated.",00:18:23.490,00:18:27.280
"And during this process,
you extract a certain amount",00:18:27.280,00:18:30.610
of heat from your fire.,00:18:30.610,00:18:34.950
"And then typically,
you realize that you",00:18:34.950,00:18:37.100
"will be releasing a
certain amount of energy",00:18:37.100,00:18:44.590
"back to the atmosphere,
causing pollution.",00:18:44.590,00:18:47.920
So there is a coal sink.,00:18:47.920,00:18:52.110
"But in the process,
you will be extracting",00:18:52.110,00:18:54.500
a certain amount of work.,00:18:54.500,00:18:57.970
"And what you want
to do is to make",00:18:57.970,00:19:02.770
the best use of this set up.,00:19:02.770,00:19:04.840
"So you're concerned
with efficiency,",00:19:04.840,00:19:10.930
"which is defined to
be the amount of work",00:19:10.930,00:19:15.160
"that you're going to extract
out of a certain amount of heat",00:19:15.160,00:19:20.190
"that you expend in
your coal, or whatever.",00:19:20.190,00:19:27.180
"And again, based on
conservation of energy,",00:19:27.180,00:19:31.800
"we expect that this W to be
less than QH by an amount",00:19:31.800,00:19:40.380
"that you are setting
to the exhaust.",00:19:40.380,00:19:43.390
"And because of that, this
eta has to be less than",00:19:43.390,00:19:47.980
"or equal to 1, in principal.",00:19:47.980,00:19:50.415
"Now, another device that is
using the same rough principles",00:19:55.440,00:20:05.050
"is the same thing
going in reverse,",00:20:05.050,00:20:07.475
which is a refrigerator.,00:20:07.475,00:20:08.475
"So in order to
cool this room, you",00:20:16.190,00:20:21.740
"use electricity or
some other means",00:20:21.740,00:20:26.120
"of doing work on a machine whose
job it is to extract heat out",00:20:26.120,00:20:34.120
of the room.,00:20:34.120,00:20:35.010
So let's say this is our room.,00:20:37.690,00:20:40.362
We want to extract the heat.,00:20:40.362,00:20:44.550
"But of course, that heat
has to go somewhere.",00:20:44.550,00:20:47.400
"So this has to have
some kind of exhaust",00:20:47.400,00:20:51.860
"putting this again to the
atmosphere or somewhere.",00:20:51.860,00:20:58.020
"So how good is this
thing performing?",00:21:00.610,00:21:04.380
"So there is a measure of the
performance-- figure of merit,",00:21:04.380,00:21:10.040
"if you like, for
this-- which we will",00:21:10.040,00:21:13.590
"label by omega, which is
how much heat you were",00:21:13.590,00:21:20.560
"able to remove from the room
given some amount of work",00:21:20.560,00:21:26.520
or energy that was put in.,00:21:26.520,00:21:28.590
"And again, because of
conservation, this W",00:21:28.590,00:21:37.180
is going to be QH minus QC.,00:21:37.180,00:21:39.140
"Now, this particular
number, which",00:21:44.660,00:21:47.240
"is a useful measure of how
well your refrigerator works,",00:21:47.240,00:21:50.850
has no particular constraint.,00:21:50.850,00:21:53.160
It can be less than 1.,00:21:53.160,00:21:54.390
It can be larger than 1.,00:21:54.390,00:21:56.290
"So again, you want it to
be as large as possible,",00:21:56.290,00:22:00.350
"and in principle, it
can be 200-- whatever.",00:22:00.350,00:22:03.960
"So clearly, already
these are very much",00:22:09.930,00:22:15.760
"idealizations of some
complicated process",00:22:15.760,00:22:18.410
that is going on.,00:22:18.410,00:22:20.520
"And the thing that
is interesting",00:22:20.520,00:22:22.900
"is that you can take
a look at how well you",00:22:22.900,00:22:27.740
"are able to do these
processes, and then",00:22:27.740,00:22:31.500
"make this equation
that we wrote up here",00:22:31.500,00:22:34.820
"to be an exact
differential form.",00:22:34.820,00:22:37.880
"So how you do that is an
interesting thing that I think",00:22:37.880,00:22:42.160
"is worth repeating
and exploring.",00:22:42.160,00:22:45.310
"And essentially, you do
that by formulating things",00:22:45.310,00:22:50.750
"that are possible
or not possible",00:22:50.750,00:22:52.760
"through the Second
Law, and then doing",00:22:52.760,00:22:55.060
some mathematical manipulations.,00:22:55.060,00:22:57.760
"And we will use two
formulations of the Second Law",00:22:57.760,00:23:02.480
due to Kevin and Clausius.,00:23:02.480,00:23:05.070
"So I will indicate them
either by K for Kelvin--",00:23:05.070,00:23:11.710
"so Kelvin's statement
of the Second Law",00:23:11.710,00:23:15.260
"is the following-- no process
is possible whose sole result",00:23:15.260,00:23:32.230
"is complete conversion
of heat to work.",00:23:32.230,00:23:42.770
"So what that is, is a statement
about how good an engine",00:23:49.560,00:23:55.810
you can make.,00:23:55.810,00:23:57.150
"He says that you cannot make
an engine that takes a certain",00:23:57.150,00:24:01.030
"amount of heat and completely
makes it to work without having",00:24:01.030,00:24:04.910
any waste QC.,00:24:04.910,00:24:07.770
"So basically, it says that
there is no ideal engine,",00:24:07.770,00:24:18.070
"and that your eta has
to be less than 1.",00:24:18.070,00:24:21.549
"There is a second
variant of this,",00:24:27.910,00:24:31.020
"which is due to Clausius-- says
that no process is possible",00:24:31.020,00:24:37.640
"whose sole result is transfer
of heat from cold to hot.",00:24:37.640,00:24:53.520
"So if you want to make
an ideal refrigerator,",00:25:01.250,00:25:07.800
"what you want to do is
to extract more and more",00:25:07.800,00:25:10.680
"QC for less and less
W. So the ideal version",00:25:10.680,00:25:16.520
"would be where essentially,
the limit of zero",00:25:16.520,00:25:20.240
"work, you would still
be able to transfer heat",00:25:20.240,00:25:23.940
"from the room to the outside
and get an ideal refrigerator.",00:25:23.940,00:25:28.335
"And Clausius says that
it's not possible.",00:25:32.850,00:25:36.126
"So these are two statements
of the Second Law.",00:25:36.126,00:25:44.860
"There are other versions and
statements of the Second Law,",00:25:44.860,00:25:49.670
"but these are kind of most close
to this historical perspective.",00:25:49.670,00:25:56.870
"And then the question is,
well, which one of them",00:25:56.870,00:26:00.710
do you want to use?,00:26:00.710,00:26:02.010
"And since I will be
kind of switching",00:26:02.010,00:26:06.060
"between using one
or the other, it",00:26:06.060,00:26:08.660
"would be good if I can
show that they really",00:26:08.660,00:26:11.270
"are the same statement,
and I'm really",00:26:11.270,00:26:13.660
"not making use of two
different statements when",00:26:13.660,00:26:16.920
"I use one or the
other alternative.",00:26:16.920,00:26:20.400
"So what I really want to do is
to show that these are really,",00:26:20.400,00:26:27.610
"logically, the same statement.",00:26:27.610,00:26:30.180
"And essentially,
what that means is",00:26:30.180,00:26:33.670
"that the two statements
are equivalent.",00:26:33.670,00:26:39.010
"And two statements are
equivalent to each other",00:26:39.010,00:26:43.584
"if one of them being
incorrect-- which I've indicated",00:26:43.584,00:26:49.950
"by K with a bar on it-- implies
that the other one is correct,",00:26:49.950,00:26:56.540
"and simultaneously,
the other way around.",00:26:56.540,00:27:01.930
"And since this does not take
more than a few minutes,",00:27:06.070,00:27:10.360
"and is a nice exercise, I
think it's worth showing this.",00:27:10.360,00:27:15.790
"So let's say that
somebody came to you",00:27:15.790,00:27:20.790
"and said that I have
constructed a machine that",00:27:20.790,00:27:24.770
violates Clausius.,00:27:24.770,00:27:27.040
We'll call that K bar.,00:27:27.040,00:27:30.430
So what does that machine do?,00:27:30.430,00:27:32.490
"What that machine does
is it converts heat, Q,",00:27:32.490,00:27:43.060
"completely to work, without
needing to exhaust anything.",00:27:43.060,00:27:49.870
"So this W is this Q, and
there's no exhaust machine.",00:27:49.870,00:27:54.155
"He says, OK I have this machine.",00:27:54.155,00:27:56.890
"I say, OK, what I will do
is I will use that work",00:27:56.890,00:28:03.160
to run a refrigerator.,00:28:03.160,00:28:05.490
"So I connect that
to a refrigerator.",00:28:05.490,00:28:08.320
"And that work will be used to
take heat, QC, out of some room",00:28:13.270,00:28:27.040
"and exhaust it to
the atmosphere.",00:28:27.040,00:28:31.490
"And I will choose
the exhaust location",00:28:31.490,00:28:36.220
"to be the same as
the source of heat",00:28:36.220,00:28:38.900
"that I had for my
anti-Kelvin machine.",00:28:38.900,00:28:45.596
OK?,00:28:45.596,00:28:46.095
"So then if you look at how
the sum of these two machines",00:28:49.810,00:28:55.386
"is operating together, from
the perspective of looking",00:28:55.386,00:29:03.590
"at the sum of the two
machines, the work",00:29:03.590,00:29:05.930
is just an internal operation.,00:29:05.930,00:29:08.030
You don't really care.,00:29:08.030,00:29:09.640
"So as far as the net thing is
concerned, what you're seeing",00:29:09.640,00:29:15.230
"is that there is no work
involved externally.",00:29:15.230,00:29:20.330
It's all internal.,00:29:20.330,00:29:21.770
"But what is happening
is that you're",00:29:21.770,00:29:23.590
"pulling QC out of the room,
and exhausting, presumably,",00:29:23.590,00:29:31.390
"what you have here-- QH
minus Q to the other side.",00:29:31.390,00:29:38.310
"This, again, by conservation of
energy must be the same as QC,",00:29:38.310,00:29:42.295
right?,00:29:42.295,00:29:44.090
"So if you have a machine
that violates Kelvin,",00:29:44.090,00:29:48.990
"you connect it to a
refrigerator, and what you have",00:29:48.990,00:29:53.090
"is a machine that transfers
heat from a cold-air",00:29:53.090,00:29:56.520
"to a hot-air body,
and violates Clausius.",00:29:56.520,00:30:01.870
"So that's the first part
we have established.",00:30:01.870,00:30:07.440
"And to establish
the second part,",00:30:07.440,00:30:09.610
"let's say that we have a
machine that violates Clausius.",00:30:09.610,00:30:19.230
"And this machine takes a
certain amount of heat, Q,",00:30:23.960,00:30:29.880
"from the room, and deposits
it to the hotter outside.",00:30:29.880,00:30:36.670
"What we will do
immediately is to take",00:30:36.670,00:30:40.990
"some of this heat that has
been generated by this machine",00:30:40.990,00:30:48.040
"and use it in a regular engine
to create some amount of work.",00:30:48.040,00:30:57.240
"And then this has to take
an amount of heat QH,",00:30:57.240,00:31:02.200
"deposit an amount of heat, QC,
which we will select to be,",00:31:02.200,00:31:08.060
"essentially, the temperature
or the room from which",00:31:08.060,00:31:12.760
"the anti Clausius
machine is operating.",00:31:12.760,00:31:16.880
"And then we will run this
engine several times,",00:31:16.880,00:31:20.020
"or fractions of times, et
cetera, and the other machine",00:31:20.020,00:31:24.010
"several times, ensuring that
QC is the same as Q. That",00:31:24.010,00:31:32.160
"is, the engine puts
out as much dumped heat",00:31:32.160,00:31:38.230
"as this anti-Clausius machine
is extracting from the room.",00:31:38.230,00:31:43.330
"Then if you look at the
combined system, what",00:31:43.330,00:31:50.550
"we see is that the combined
system is doing the following--",00:31:50.550,00:31:58.280
this was equivalent to this.,00:31:58.280,00:32:00.540
"This is equivalent
to a combined system",00:32:00.540,00:32:08.110
"that does a certain
amount of work.",00:32:08.110,00:32:10.640
"So there is a W
that is coming out.",00:32:10.640,00:32:14.010
"There is no heat
exchange with the room,",00:32:14.010,00:32:17.620
"because we ensured that these
two heats are completely",00:32:17.620,00:32:20.690
balanced.,00:32:20.690,00:32:21.940
"So you can sort of think
of them as something",00:32:21.940,00:32:24.080
"that is internal to
this bigger machine.",00:32:24.080,00:32:27.210
"And so what is happening
is that there's",00:32:27.210,00:32:29.920
"a certain amount of heat, QH
minus Q that is taken here",00:32:29.920,00:32:35.550
"that has to be equal to W,
by conservation of energy.",00:32:35.550,00:32:39.890
"And we have converted
heat entirely",00:32:39.890,00:32:42.400
"to work, violating
Kelvin's statement.",00:32:42.400,00:32:47.100
"So basically, we
have proved this.",00:32:47.100,00:32:49.984
Any questions?,00:33:27.552,00:33:28.135
"OK, one more step-- there
is actually a couple",00:33:32.190,00:33:34.920
"more steps left before we get to
construct our entropy function.",00:33:34.920,00:33:39.805
"And the next step is
the Carnot Engine.",00:33:43.190,00:33:45.090
"So this is yet another
one of these idealizations",00:33:53.950,00:33:58.570
"that-- again, theoretical
construct, which you",00:33:58.570,00:34:02.220
"can try to approach as in
some limiting procedure.",00:34:02.220,00:34:05.570
"A Carnot engine is any engine
with the following properties--",00:34:08.219,00:34:18.139
"that is, one, reversible,
two, operates in a cycle,",00:34:18.139,00:34:43.380
"and three, all inputs--
all heat inputs--",00:34:43.380,00:34:56.219
outputs at two temperatures.,00:34:56.219,00:35:00.990
"OK, so let's go
through the conditions.",00:35:10.150,00:35:16.680
"Reversible implies
that at any stage,",00:35:16.680,00:35:24.780
"if I change the directions
of inputs and outputs,",00:35:24.780,00:35:30.810
it will just go backward.,00:35:30.810,00:35:33.230
"So can go forward, backward,
by reversing inputs, outputs.",00:35:33.230,00:35:50.573
"And so again, think of
the case of our spring",00:35:56.850,00:36:04.700
"that we were pushing
back and forth.",00:36:04.700,00:36:09.430
"In order for it to have this
property of reversibility,",00:36:09.430,00:36:15.690
"I should not only do it pulling
down and up sufficiently slowly",00:36:15.690,00:36:22.300
"so that at each stage, I
can define its tension,",00:36:22.300,00:36:26.230
"but also as far
as its connection",00:36:26.230,00:36:28.910
"to the outside world, I have
to do it frictionlessly,",00:36:28.910,00:36:32.430
"so that if I were to reverse
the direction of the force",00:36:32.430,00:36:36.290
"that I have, it will either go
forward or backward, reversing",00:36:36.290,00:36:40.290
the path that it has.,00:36:40.290,00:36:41.990
"If there is any friction
that is involved,",00:36:41.990,00:36:45.270
then I cannot do that.,00:36:45.270,00:36:48.270
"So essentially,
this reversibility",00:36:48.270,00:36:51.530
"is some kind of a generalization
of the frictionless condition",00:36:51.530,00:36:58.760
that we would use in mechanics.,00:36:58.760,00:37:00.105
The cycle part is easy.,00:37:05.870,00:37:07.330
"Essentially, it says
that the start and end",00:37:10.910,00:37:14.460
points are the same.,00:37:14.460,00:37:15.400
"And it kind of harks
back to this statement",00:37:24.430,00:37:30.920
"that is part of either
one of these formulations",00:37:30.920,00:37:35.240
"of the Second Law--
that is the net result",00:37:35.240,00:37:38.630
or sole result is something.,00:37:38.630,00:37:41.010
"So we want the
engine to essentially",00:37:41.010,00:37:43.710
"be back to where it
was, so that when",00:37:43.710,00:37:47.020
"we are looking at changes
that are involved,",00:37:47.020,00:37:49.820
"we say, OK, the engine is
not part of the equation.",00:37:49.820,00:37:52.450
"It is where it was
at the beginning",00:37:52.450,00:37:55.560
and at the end of the cycle.,00:37:55.560,00:37:59.490
"Now there's something
that I didn't emphasize,",00:37:59.490,00:38:05.110
"but I was-- and actually,
I was not really using,",00:38:05.110,00:38:09.900
"but you may have
thought I was using--",00:38:09.900,00:38:13.170
"is that in all of these
pictures that I drew,",00:38:13.170,00:38:18.070
"I said there is a hot place
and there's a cold place.",00:38:18.070,00:38:21.990
"Now, I didn't specify
exactly what these are,",00:38:21.990,00:38:26.000
"and whether this corresponds
to a particular temperature.",00:38:26.000,00:38:29.820
"Now, for the case of the Carnot
engine, I have to be precise.",00:38:29.820,00:38:33.700
"I have to say that this is
always at one temperature.",00:38:33.700,00:38:37.820
"This is always at the
other temperature.",00:38:37.820,00:38:40.480
"So these Carnot engines
are defined implicitly",00:38:40.480,00:38:46.450
"with two temperature
labels corresponding",00:38:46.450,00:38:49.280
"to the hot part
and the cold part.",00:38:49.280,00:38:53.640
"In principle, everything
else that I talked about",00:38:53.640,00:38:56.320
"could have had a
range of temperatures.",00:38:56.320,00:38:59.066
"But the Carnot engine says,
OK, just two temperatures.",00:38:59.066,00:39:01.710
"OK, so for the Carnot
engine, if I can now",00:39:07.370,00:39:11.820
"draw a diagram that would
be kind of straight line",00:39:11.820,00:39:18.910
version of what I had before.,00:39:18.910,00:39:21.170
"And the Carnot engine will be
extracting a certain amount",00:39:21.170,00:39:27.700
"of heat, QH, from
here, QC from here,",00:39:27.700,00:39:33.100
doing a certain amount of work.,00:39:33.100,00:39:36.150
"And since it is reversible, I
could actually run it backward.",00:39:36.150,00:39:40.910
"I could have W. I
could have QH, QC,",00:39:40.910,00:39:47.890
"and it would work
as a refrigerator.",00:39:47.890,00:39:50.290
"Now, it is good to have
at least one example--",00:40:05.080,00:40:10.780
"that such a theoretical
construct as a Carnot engine",00:40:10.780,00:40:15.590
"can be made based on
things that we have so far.",00:40:15.590,00:40:20.120
"And we can be
explicit, and show that",00:40:20.120,00:40:24.060
for the case of the ideal gas.,00:40:24.060,00:40:26.386
"So we said that a gas I
can represent in equivalent",00:40:37.010,00:40:44.950
"by a point in the
pressure-volume diagram.",00:40:44.950,00:40:48.230
"So let's say that
what is the working",00:40:51.480,00:40:56.580
"substance of this
Carnot engine is a gas.",00:40:56.580,00:40:59.870
"And part of this
whole story is that it",00:40:59.870,00:41:04.420
"should be working between two
isotherms-- the TH and TC.",00:41:04.420,00:41:09.010
"But we've already
established that we",00:41:09.010,00:41:11.490
"can have isotherms for the
ideal gas that correspond",00:41:11.490,00:41:16.460
"to these curves that
correspond to PV as constant.",00:41:16.460,00:41:22.300
"So I could really choose
one of the isotherms",00:41:22.300,00:41:25.490
"that we discussed before
corresponds to TH.",00:41:25.490,00:41:28.110
One corresponds to TC.,00:41:28.110,00:41:30.530
"And I can imagine taking a gas
whose initial state is point A,",00:41:30.530,00:41:40.740
"and expanding it while
maintaining it at this isotherm",00:41:40.740,00:41:47.810
"TH, and ending up
at some point B.",00:41:47.810,00:41:54.360
"So as I'm expanding this,
let's say we have put this gas.",00:41:54.360,00:41:58.920
"I have this piston
that contains this gas.",00:41:58.920,00:42:02.510
"My TH and TC
correspond to two baths",00:42:02.510,00:42:06.500
"that correspond to, if you
like, lakes-- a temperature",00:42:06.500,00:42:09.630
"TH, lakes at temperature TC.",00:42:09.630,00:42:11.480
"I took my piston, put
it into the hot bath,",00:42:11.480,00:42:14.890
make it expand up to some point.,00:42:14.890,00:42:18.550
"And in the process,
there is certainly",00:42:18.550,00:42:21.160
"a certain amount of heat that
will go into the system, QH.",00:42:21.160,00:42:25.610
"So I have taken QH
out of the hot source.",00:42:28.530,00:42:36.260
"Now, next thing
that I want to do",00:42:36.260,00:42:39.290
"is to take this, and put
it into the colder lake.",00:42:39.290,00:42:44.092
"But what the process is,
is I have to do it in a way",00:42:44.092,00:42:49.340
that there is no heat exchange.,00:42:49.340,00:42:52.270
"So I have to find the path
that goes from the hot bath",00:42:52.270,00:42:57.850
"to the cold path-- to
point C, some point C--",00:42:57.850,00:43:02.150
without any heat involved.,00:43:02.150,00:43:03.430
"We'll have to ask
how that's possible,",00:43:06.140,00:43:08.280
"and what's the
structure of that path.",00:43:08.280,00:43:11.040
"Once I'm in the
colder bath, then I",00:43:11.040,00:43:14.480
"can expand my gas
up to some point D.",00:43:14.480,00:43:21.280
"And clearly, I have to choose
this point D sufficiently",00:43:21.280,00:43:25.620
"precisely so that
then, when I take",00:43:25.620,00:43:30.160
"my gas from the cool to
the original hot position,",00:43:30.160,00:43:35.520
"I end up at precisely the
location that I started,",00:43:35.520,00:43:40.620
"so that I have
completed a cycle.",00:43:40.620,00:43:42.480
"So it's necessary
that I should be",00:43:45.060,00:43:47.040
"able to construct these
two paths, BC and DA, that",00:43:47.040,00:43:52.580
correspond to no heat exchange.,00:43:52.580,00:43:55.340
"And somehow I'm sure that
I can complete this cycle.",00:43:55.340,00:43:58.940
"So the paths BC
and DA are called",00:44:02.480,00:44:13.210
"adiabats, or adiabatic
paths, in the sense",00:44:13.210,00:44:20.820
"that this is what
you would get if you",00:44:20.820,00:44:23.980
"put your system in a container
with these adiabatic walls that",00:44:23.980,00:44:30.840
allows no exchange of heat.,00:44:30.840,00:44:33.580
"Now clearly, I also want to
do this sufficiently slowly",00:44:33.580,00:44:37.500
"so that infinitesimally,
I can draw",00:44:37.500,00:44:39.910
this path as a series of points.,00:44:39.910,00:44:42.510
"And so I don't want to do what
was in the Joule expansion",00:44:42.510,00:44:46.180
"experiment, and suddenly
expand the whole thing.",00:44:46.180,00:44:50.160
"I have to do it
sufficiently slowly",00:44:50.160,00:44:52.150
"so that the conditions of this
Carnot engine are satisfied.",00:44:52.150,00:44:57.890
"So along these paths,
what do I know?",00:44:57.890,00:45:00.570
By definition dQ is 0.,00:45:00.570,00:45:04.550
"And dQ is dE minus
dW along those paths.",00:45:04.550,00:45:12.990
"And since I'm performing these
paths sufficiently slowly,",00:45:12.990,00:45:16.790
"I can write the W
as PdV minus PdV.",00:45:16.790,00:45:23.440
"Now, what you will show
in the problem set is",00:45:32.090,00:45:36.170
"that I don't need to make any
assumption about the functional",00:45:36.170,00:45:40.680
"form of energy on P and V. Just
knowing that I'm describing",00:45:40.680,00:45:47.855
"a system that is characterized
by two coordinates, P and V,",00:45:47.855,00:45:52.310
"is sufficient for you to
construct these curves.",00:45:52.310,00:45:56.320
"Turns out that if you
have more than two",00:45:56.320,00:45:58.360
"coordinates-- three or four
coordinates-- at this time",00:45:58.360,00:46:01.080
"you don't know that you
will be able to do so.",00:46:01.080,00:46:03.640
But we're sticking with this.,00:46:03.640,00:46:06.750
"For simplicity, I'm going
to choose this-- the form",00:46:06.750,00:46:10.610
"that I have for the ideal gas,
which I know that it's really",00:46:10.610,00:46:14.675
"a function only
of the product PV.",00:46:14.675,00:46:18.540
This is what we had used before.,00:46:18.540,00:46:21.640
"And again, so as to
simplify the algebra,",00:46:21.640,00:46:25.650
"I will use the form that is
applicable to a monoatomic gas.",00:46:25.650,00:46:31.175
"And this-- I really have
no reason to do this,",00:46:35.290,00:46:38.050
"except that I want to be
able to get through this",00:46:38.050,00:46:40.270
in two minutes with the algebra.,00:46:40.270,00:46:43.085
"So I will write the
energy to be 3/2 PV.",00:46:43.085,00:46:47.220
"So then for that particular
choice, what I have here",00:46:47.220,00:46:51.590
is d of 3/2 PV plus PdV.,00:46:51.590,00:46:57.210
"And that's 3/2 PdV plus
V, 3/2 VdP plus PdV,",00:46:57.210,00:47:09.420
"which is 5/2 PdV
plus 3/2 VdP is 0.",00:47:09.420,00:47:19.600
"And you can
rearrange that easily",00:47:19.600,00:47:22.280
"to dP over P plus
5/3 dV over V is 0.",00:47:22.280,00:47:35.030
"And this is simply the
derivative of log of PV",00:47:35.030,00:47:40.470
to the power of 5/3.,00:47:40.470,00:47:43.700
"And since this
derivative is 0, you",00:47:43.700,00:47:49.010
"know that along the curves that
correspond to no heat exchange,",00:47:49.010,00:47:53.920
"you have something like
PV to the power of gamma--",00:47:53.920,00:47:58.600
"in this case, gamma being
5/3-- that is some constant.",00:47:58.600,00:48:08.620
"So after you have done your
expansion, all you need is to,",00:48:11.730,00:48:16.695
"in this diagram, go
continuously along the path",00:48:16.695,00:48:19.910
"that corresponds to this
formula that we have indicated.",00:48:19.910,00:48:24.720
"And this formula
describes a path",00:48:24.720,00:48:27.330
"that is distinct
from the isotherm.",00:48:27.330,00:48:30.230
So you start from somewhere.,00:48:30.230,00:48:32.350
You start along some path.,00:48:32.350,00:48:34.400
"You are guaranteed to hit the
other isotherm at some point.",00:48:34.400,00:48:38.750
"You start from the
starting point.",00:48:38.750,00:48:40.410
You go backward.,00:48:40.410,00:48:41.840
"You're guaranteed to hit
the isotherm at some point.",00:48:41.840,00:48:44.950
"And then you join
those two points,",00:48:44.950,00:48:46.490
and you've completed your cycle.,00:48:46.490,00:48:48.420
"And so you know that, at least
for the case of the ideal gas,",00:48:48.420,00:48:54.340
"or actually for any
two-coordinate system,",00:48:54.340,00:48:57.100
"you can construct
a cardinal cycle.",00:48:57.100,00:49:00.870
"That is, put your material,
go through a cycle that",00:49:00.870,00:49:06.070
"is reversible with all heat
exchanges at two temperatures",00:49:06.070,00:49:10.240
only.,00:49:10.240,00:49:10.740
"OK, now why is this
idealization even useful?",00:49:32.490,00:49:37.464
"Well, we said that
this Carnot engine",00:49:37.464,00:49:40.140
"is stamped by really two
temperatures-- TH and TC.",00:49:40.140,00:49:48.160
"And the following
theorem is important,",00:49:48.160,00:49:53.180
"which says that of all
engines operating only",00:49:53.180,00:50:06.410
"between TH and TC, the Carnot
engine is most efficient.",00:50:06.410,00:50:14.900
"So we are going to move
away from this idealization",00:50:27.700,00:50:31.440
"that we've made, but so
far, only in one small step.",00:50:31.440,00:50:34.955
"That is, we are still going
to assume that all heat",00:50:34.955,00:50:38.390
"exchanges are done
between TH and TC.",00:50:38.390,00:50:43.470
"OK, and so let's
say that we have",00:50:43.470,00:50:47.270
"some kind of an engine which
does not have to be reversible.",00:50:47.270,00:50:56.320
"So because it does not
have to be reversible,",00:50:56.320,00:51:00.080
"it's not a Carnot engine, but
otherwise, operates completely",00:51:00.080,00:51:05.270
between these two points.,00:51:05.270,00:51:07.100
"So it takes, let's say,
heat QH prime, QC prime,",00:51:07.100,00:51:14.000
"and does a certain
amount of work W.",00:51:14.000,00:51:21.210
"And so somebody
comes and says, I've",00:51:21.210,00:51:26.250
"constructed this engine
that is actually very good.",00:51:26.250,00:51:30.860
"It's better than
your Carnot engine.",00:51:30.860,00:51:33.590
"I say, no, that's not possible.",00:51:33.590,00:51:35.650
"And the way that I
will prove it to you",00:51:35.650,00:51:37.380
"is as follows-- I will take
the output of your engine,",00:51:37.380,00:51:42.280
"connect it to a Carnot engine,
and since the Carnot engine",00:51:42.280,00:51:46.950
"can be run backward, it
will act as a refrigerator",00:51:46.950,00:51:53.460
"and extract heat and
deposit heat precisely",00:51:53.460,00:51:57.390
"at the two temperatures that
your engine is operating.",00:51:57.390,00:52:02.530
"So if somebody looks at the
combination of these two,",00:52:02.530,00:52:08.050
what do they see?,00:52:08.050,00:52:10.830
"The thing that they
see for the combination",00:52:10.830,00:52:14.100
"is that there is
some entity that",00:52:14.100,00:52:16.980
is operating between TH and TC.,00:52:16.980,00:52:20.870
"And there is some
internal amount of work",00:52:20.870,00:52:23.400
"that is going on, and you
don't care about that.",00:52:23.400,00:52:26.440
"But there is a certain amount
of heat, QH prime minus QH that",00:52:26.440,00:52:31.970
becomes QC prime minus QC.,00:52:31.970,00:52:35.050
Now here we invoke Clausius.,00:52:40.300,00:52:43.260
"Clausius says that if you
see heat going between two",00:52:46.640,00:52:51.740
"temperatures, it could have only
gone from the direction hotter",00:52:51.740,00:52:56.720
"to colder, which means
that this amount of heat",00:52:56.720,00:53:01.300
has to be positive.,00:53:01.300,00:53:03.420
"QH prime should be
greater than QH.",00:53:03.420,00:53:08.550
"So this is why Clausius-- we
know that this has to be case.",00:53:08.550,00:53:14.550
"So then what I can do, is I can
divide both expressions by W.",00:53:19.350,00:53:29.050
And then invert this thing.,00:53:29.050,00:53:31.330
"And if I invert it, the
inequality gets inverted.",00:53:31.330,00:53:34.840
"So I get that W over QH
prime is less than W over QH.",00:53:34.840,00:53:42.560
"And the left-hand
side is the efficiency",00:53:42.560,00:53:48.020
of my non-Carnot engine.,00:53:48.020,00:53:50.630
"And the right-hand side is the
efficiency of my Carnot engine.",00:53:50.630,00:53:55.190
"Carnot And what I've shown
is that the efficiency",00:53:55.190,00:53:59.200
"of the non-Carnot engine
has to be less than",00:53:59.200,00:54:01.900
"or equal to the efficiency
of the Carnot engine.",00:54:01.900,00:54:04.140
"OK, now, the next step
is the following--",00:54:07.840,00:54:16.360
"that all Carnot engines
operating between TH and TC",00:54:16.360,00:54:36.690
have the same efficiency.,00:54:36.690,00:54:37.740
"And the statement is, suppose
I have two different Carnot",00:54:49.470,00:54:55.620
"engines-- Carnot engine
one and Carnot engine two.",00:54:55.620,00:54:58.690
"I can use one to run
the other one backward,",00:54:58.690,00:55:01.150
"and I would get that the
efficiency of Carnot engine one",00:55:01.150,00:55:04.840
"is less than or equal to Carnot
engine two, or the other way",00:55:04.840,00:55:07.610
"around-- that two is less
than or equal to one.",00:55:07.610,00:55:10.750
"And hence, the
only possibility is",00:55:10.750,00:55:12.520
"that they are the same, which
is actually interesting,",00:55:12.520,00:55:17.990
"because I told you that
Carnot engines are stamped",00:55:17.990,00:55:20.740
"by two temperatures, TH and TC.",00:55:20.740,00:55:25.330
"And what it says
is that they all",00:55:25.330,00:55:28.390
"have an efficiency that
is a function, therefore,",00:55:28.390,00:55:31.510
of these two temperatures only.,00:55:31.510,00:55:33.710
"It cannot depend on whether I
constructed my Carnot engine",00:55:33.710,00:55:37.260
out of an ideal gas.,00:55:37.260,00:55:40.920
"I constructed it
out of a rubber band",00:55:40.920,00:55:43.260
"that I was pulling or pushing,
or any other substance",00:55:43.260,00:55:48.040
"in the world that
you can think about,",00:55:48.040,00:55:51.360
"as long as that substance I can
construct some kind of a Carnot",00:55:51.360,00:55:55.720
"cycle, irrespective of what the
coordinate systems are, what",00:55:55.720,00:56:01.200
"the isotherms look
like, et cetera.",00:56:01.200,00:56:03.710
"Just working between two
temperatures and two isotherms",00:56:03.710,00:56:07.130
"tells me that this
reversible cycle",00:56:07.130,00:56:11.140
"will have this efficiency
relating the amount of work",00:56:11.140,00:56:15.740
"and the amount of heat
that these exchange as you",00:56:15.740,00:56:18.550
go around.,00:56:18.550,00:56:19.950
OK?,00:56:19.950,00:56:22.190
"Now, that's important
because previously we",00:56:22.190,00:56:26.340
"wanted to define
our temperature.",00:56:26.340,00:56:28.770
"And we had to rely on
some property of the gas.",00:56:28.770,00:56:33.260
"We said OK, empirically we
observe that for the gas,",00:56:33.260,00:56:37.290
"you have this relationship
that when it is dilute,",00:56:37.290,00:56:39.940
"PV is proportional to T and we
use that property of the gas",00:56:39.940,00:56:45.170
"to construct our ideal
gas temperature scale.",00:56:45.170,00:56:49.105
"Well, that's OK, but it
relies on some observations",00:56:49.105,00:56:54.260
"additionally to everything
else that we had.",00:56:54.260,00:56:57.430
"Whereas now we have the
means to define temperatures",00:56:57.430,00:57:01.470
irrespective of any material.,00:57:01.470,00:57:03.760
"This is much more of
a universal quantity.",00:57:03.760,00:57:06.555
"It' doesn't depend
on any substance,",00:57:06.555,00:57:08.670
any particular structure.,00:57:08.670,00:57:10.640
"So it's a much
better way to rely",00:57:10.640,00:57:14.130
"for constructing a
temperature scale.",00:57:14.130,00:57:17.190
"So in some sense, at
least theoretically,",00:57:17.190,00:57:22.060
"we are going to abandon
our previous temperature",00:57:22.060,00:57:24.690
"scale based on properties
of the ideal gas,",00:57:24.690,00:57:27.565
"and reconstruct the temperature
scale based on this.",00:57:27.565,00:57:31.717
Any questions?,00:57:31.717,00:57:32.300
OK.,00:57:36.050,00:57:37.610
"So this is what will be called
the thermodynamic temperature",00:57:37.610,00:57:42.530
scale.,00:57:42.530,00:57:43.030
"And what it amounts
to is that somehow I",00:57:50.020,00:57:56.540
"use the efficiency
between two temperatures",00:57:56.540,00:58:01.100
"or vice versa-- use that
there are two temperatures.",00:58:01.100,00:58:04.960
"Let's say one of them is
a reference temperature.",00:58:04.960,00:58:07.500
"I derive the temperature
of the other one",00:58:07.500,00:58:11.570
"by the maximum efficiency
of all engines that",00:58:11.570,00:58:14.470
"can operate between
the reference",00:58:14.470,00:58:16.660
"temperature and the temperature
that I wish to measure.",00:58:16.660,00:58:20.150
It's T.,00:58:20.150,00:58:21.790
"But that means I--
before doing that, I",00:58:21.790,00:58:24.330
"need to know at least something,
or some kind of a postulate",00:58:24.330,00:58:27.340
"about the structure of this
function of two variables.",00:58:27.340,00:58:31.230
"And I cannot write any
arbitrary function.",00:58:31.230,00:58:35.580
"It has to satisfy certain
properties and symmetries.",00:58:35.580,00:58:39.870
"And I can see what
those properties are",00:58:39.870,00:58:44.430
"by putting a couple of
these engines in series.",00:58:44.430,00:58:49.320
"So let's imagine that we
have a structure where",00:58:49.320,00:58:53.490
"I have the highest
temperature T1,",00:58:53.490,00:58:57.120
"and intermediate temperature T2,
and the lowest temperature T3.",00:58:57.120,00:59:04.270
"And I put one Carnot engine
to operate between these two",00:59:04.270,00:59:09.790
"temperatures, and one to operate
between these temperatures.",00:59:09.790,00:59:14.510
"And the first one is
going to take heat",00:59:14.510,00:59:18.350
that I will called Q1.,00:59:18.350,00:59:20.374
"And release a heat that I will
call Q2, in the process doing",00:59:25.370,00:59:32.650
"a certain amount of work that
I will call W between 1 and 2.",00:59:32.650,00:59:37.960
"Now what I will do is I will use
the entirety of that heat, Q2,",00:59:37.960,00:59:44.820
"to run the second Carnot
engine to temperature T3,",00:59:44.820,00:59:50.240
"reducing here the
amount of heat, Q3,",00:59:50.240,00:59:54.670
"and doing a certain
amount of work-- W23.",00:59:54.670,00:59:56.895
"Clearly what I want
to do is to say",01:00:00.210,01:00:03.580
"that when I look at the
combination of these things,",01:00:03.580,01:00:09.610
"what happens at temperature
2 is an intermediate.",01:00:09.610,01:00:15.110
"And the whole thing is
equivalent to a Carnot engine",01:00:15.110,01:00:19.780
operating between T1 and T3.,01:00:19.780,01:00:22.570
"Again, the whole
thing is reversible,",01:00:22.570,01:00:26.830
"operates between
two temperatures,",01:00:26.830,01:00:29.140
"and since each
one of them can be",01:00:29.140,01:00:30.720
"made to go back to where
they started, is a cycle.",01:00:30.720,01:00:33.660
"So the whole thing is really
equivalent to another Carnot",01:00:33.660,01:00:37.764
"engine that takes
Q1, deposits Q3, does",01:00:37.764,01:00:48.770
"a certain amount
of work, W13, which",01:00:48.770,01:00:51.810
is the sum of W12 plus W23.,01:00:51.810,01:00:54.752
"So clearly, these two
different perspectives",01:00:58.600,01:01:02.670
"on the same operation
will constrain",01:01:02.670,01:01:05.870
"some-- give some
constraint between the form",01:01:05.870,01:01:09.350
"of the functions that
will be describing",01:01:09.350,01:01:11.420
"the efficiencies
of Carnot engines.",01:01:11.420,01:01:13.940
"So let's follow
that mathematically.",01:01:13.940,01:01:17.270
"OK, so the first
one-- what do we have?",01:01:17.270,01:01:22.910
"By conservation
of energy, I have",01:01:22.910,01:01:24.940
"that Q2 is-- so this
is-- let me be precise.",01:01:24.940,01:01:31.510
"This is Carnot engine 1-- tells

"All right, so how
much heat I have here",01:01:44.100,01:01:46.240
"is the difference between
this and the amount of work",01:01:46.240,01:01:48.680
"that I did--
conservation of energy.",01:01:48.680,01:01:51.830
"W12 is the efficiency times Q.
That was how it was defined.",01:01:51.830,01:01:58.110

operating between T1 and T2",01:01:58.110,01:02:04.140
times Q1.,01:02:04.140,01:02:05.870

Carnot engine number 2?",01:02:09.000,01:02:11.530
"Carnot engine
number 2 says that I",01:02:14.260,01:02:17.200

the difference between Q2",01:02:17.200,01:02:22.920

is done over here.",01:02:22.920,01:02:26.340

from the first equation, what",01:02:37.070,01:02:41.690
do I get?,01:02:41.690,01:02:42.250

second bracket that",01:02:47.120,01:02:50.970
is 1 minus efficiency T2 T3.,01:02:50.970,01:02:53.590
"But I can also look at the
composite Carnot engine-- that",01:03:02.300,01:03:08.180
"is the sum total
of them represented",01:03:08.180,01:03:12.330
by the diagram on the right.,01:03:12.330,01:03:15.030
"And what that states-- just
writing the whole thing",01:03:15.030,01:03:18.190
"same way-- is that this
Q3 is the same as Q1",01:03:18.190,01:03:26.270

"1 minus the efficiency
between T1 and T3.",01:03:33.690,01:03:37.528

I have two equations that",01:03:41.930,01:03:46.170
"relate Q3 and Q1-- essentially
two formulations of this ratio.",01:03:46.170,01:03:55.920
"And what that says is that the
efficiency functions calculated",01:03:55.920,01:04:08.330
"between pairs of
temperatures, when",01:04:08.330,01:04:11.930
"we look at triplet of them,
have to be related by 1 minus",01:04:11.930,01:04:16.480

1 minus efficiency between T1",01:04:16.480,01:04:23.200
"and T2, 1 minus efficiency
between T2 and T3.",01:04:23.200,01:04:28.582
"So when we are constructing
our temperature scale",01:04:32.200,01:04:37.080
"based on properties of
this efficiency function,",01:04:37.080,01:04:41.350

efficiency function",01:04:41.350,01:04:44.210

did this type of equality",01:04:49.880,01:04:54.580
come from?,01:04:54.580,01:04:57.550
"It originated in the fact that
this 1 minus eta was the ratio",01:04:57.550,01:05:05.940
of two Q's.,01:05:05.940,01:05:08.810
"This was the ratio
of Q2 over Q1,",01:05:08.810,01:05:12.250

one was Q1 over Q3,",01:05:12.250,01:05:14.860

multiply them, and you",01:05:14.860,01:05:16.360
"would get Q2 over Q3, et cetera.",01:05:16.360,01:05:19.520
"And that gives you
a hint as to how",01:05:19.520,01:05:22.790
"you should construct
this function",01:05:22.790,01:05:25.290
"to satisfy the
property that you want.",01:05:25.290,01:05:28.420

ratio of some function of T2",01:05:28.420,01:05:37.210
"divided by some
function of T1, it",01:05:37.210,01:05:40.580

precisely the same way",01:05:40.580,01:05:43.380

do is to postulate",01:05:49.580,01:05:54.960
that this is of this form.,01:05:54.960,01:05:58.870

free to choose any function",01:05:58.870,01:06:02.970

that we make--",01:06:09.830,01:06:12.790
"so this is-- this
was not required--",01:06:12.790,01:06:19.740
"is that this is really the
functional form is linear.",01:06:19.740,01:06:22.200

scale.,01:06:29.090,01:06:29.590

part, the step right",01:06:39.390,01:06:41.890

you wrote F of T1 over T1,",01:06:41.890,01:06:46.650

mean more precisely",01:08:14.077,01:08:15.702

T2 and T1 using F",01:08:15.702,01:08:20.927

the question that was posed,",01:10:03.460,01:10:07.160

that we use the [INAUDIBLE]",01:10:36.416,01:10:41.960

thermodynamic temperature,",01:10:41.960,01:10:45.710

PROFESSOR: That's fine.,01:10:47.502,01:10:48.460

did with the Zeroth Law was",01:10:48.460,01:10:53.400
"to state that for somebody that
exists in thermal equilibrium",01:10:53.400,01:10:58.350
"with a bath, I can
characterize it with the theta.",01:10:58.350,01:11:02.600

the whole argument",01:11:02.600,01:11:04.840

"PROFESSOR: OK, so now that
becomes a different question.",01:12:05.050,01:12:07.600

first question was,",01:12:07.600,01:12:09.880
"let's not define any temperature
scale up to this point.",01:12:09.880,01:12:13.430
"And this is the first time that
we define a temperature scale.",01:12:13.430,01:12:16.480
"Now, your question
is the one that I",01:12:16.480,01:12:17.980
"wanted to originally
answer, so thank you",01:12:17.980,01:12:20.230
"for the question, which
is that I actually",01:12:20.230,01:12:22.420
"did define for you a temperature
scale through some property",01:12:22.420,01:12:26.210
of the ideal gas.,01:12:26.210,01:12:27.670
"And indeed, that
property of the ideal gas",01:12:27.670,01:12:31.080
"I implicitly used here in
the shape of the isotherms",01:12:31.080,01:12:34.710

functional in this fashion.,01:12:38.540,01:12:41.430

OK, you defined",01:12:41.430,01:12:44.880
temperature two different ways.,01:12:44.880,01:12:46.530
"Are they consistent
with each other?",01:12:46.530,01:12:48.980
"And you will have
a problem set that",01:12:48.980,01:12:51.520
"will ask the following
question-- let's",01:12:51.520,01:12:54.160
"run an ideal gas Carnot cycle
between ideal gas temperatures",01:12:54.160,01:13:01.120
theta H and theta C. OK?,01:13:01.120,01:13:05.540
"Now you can-- and I
have drawn for you",01:13:05.540,01:13:08.860
the form of this Carnot cycle.,01:13:08.860,01:13:11.810
"Using PdV, you can calculate
what amount of work",01:13:11.810,01:13:16.420
"goes into this at
different stages.",01:13:16.420,01:13:19.050
"And the net work would be
the area of this cycle.",01:13:19.050,01:13:22.640
"So W would give you
the area of the cycle.",01:13:22.640,01:13:26.180
You can calculate what QH is.,01:13:26.180,01:13:29.810
"And you can calculate
the efficiency",01:13:29.810,01:13:31.940
"of this as a function
theta H and theta C.",01:13:31.940,01:13:38.810
"And what you will find, if
you do things correctly,",01:13:38.810,01:13:41.930
"is that using all of these
definitions for the shapes",01:13:41.930,01:13:48.770
"of these isotherms,
you can calculate",01:13:48.770,01:13:51.510
what the efficiency is.,01:13:51.510,01:13:53.150
"And the answer for
your efficiency",01:13:53.150,01:13:54.910
"will come out to be
theta H minus theta",01:13:54.910,01:13:57.370
"C divided by theta H, which is
precisely what you would have",01:13:57.370,01:14:01.500
"expected based on
the Carnot cycle.",01:14:01.500,01:14:04.780
"So then you can
establish that the ratio",01:14:04.780,01:14:07.860
"of theta H to theta C
defined through the ideal gas",01:14:07.860,01:14:11.910
"temperature scale is the same
as the ratio of the temperatures",01:14:11.910,01:14:16.160
"if you had defined
through the thermodynamic.",01:14:16.160,01:14:18.640
"So the two scales, once
you set the same point",01:14:18.640,01:14:23.300
"for both of them,
become identical.",01:14:23.300,01:14:26.210
Other questions?,01:14:31.580,01:14:34.540
"OK, so we went
through all of this",01:14:34.540,01:14:42.690
"in order to ultimately
get back to the story",01:14:42.690,01:14:48.970
"that I was constructing at the
beginning of the lecture, which",01:14:48.970,01:14:53.320
"was that I'd like to have the
form ultimately for my energy.",01:14:53.320,01:15:01.950
I want to construct the energy.,01:15:01.950,01:15:04.300
"And if I was looking only
at mechanical systems,",01:15:04.300,01:15:07.550
"and there was no
temperature in the world,",01:15:07.550,01:15:09.920
"I would construct it
as sum over i Ji dxi.",01:15:09.920,01:15:14.300
"But I know that
that's not enough,",01:15:14.300,01:15:16.550

by which I can change",01:15:16.550,01:15:19.120

mechanical work-- go from one",01:15:19.120,01:15:23.650
"point in the diagram to
another point in the diagram.",01:15:23.650,01:15:26.460
So there must be something else.,01:15:26.460,01:15:29.860

of makes a lot of sense",01:15:29.860,01:15:33.600
"that something else should be
something like a temperature.",01:15:33.600,01:15:38.140
"And before that,
really, the only thing",01:15:38.140,01:15:40.670
"that we had that was
a form of temperature",01:15:40.670,01:15:44.440
"was the ideal gas temperature,
or the empirical temperature",01:15:44.440,01:15:48.040
"that we had defined
through the Zeroth Law.",01:15:48.040,01:15:50.330
"And neither of them had any
nice connection to heat.",01:15:50.330,01:15:55.710
"Through this Carnot
engines, et cetera you",01:15:55.710,01:15:58.330
"have established some kind of
a connection between heats,",01:15:58.330,01:16:02.400
"temperatures, et cetera.",01:16:02.400,01:16:04.250
"And that's why this
thermodynamic temperature",01:16:04.250,01:16:06.305
scale is useful.,01:16:06.305,01:16:08.210
"It is independent
of any material.",01:16:08.210,01:16:10.890
"And it's really the T
that I should put here.",01:16:10.890,01:16:13.820
"And so the next question
is, what should I put here?",01:16:13.820,01:16:18.250
"And that will also come
through the Second Law.",01:16:18.250,01:16:22.970
"I will develop that mostly
the next time around,",01:16:22.970,01:16:27.100
"but I'll give you in the next
two or three minutes a preview.",01:16:27.100,01:16:31.620
"So the statement that we
had was that the efficiency",01:16:31.620,01:16:36.850
"of any engine is less than
the Carnot engine, right?",01:16:36.850,01:16:40.190
"So let's imagine that we
have some kind of a exchange",01:16:40.190,01:16:44.200
process going between TH and TC.,01:16:44.200,01:16:48.070
"And there is some
engine-- I don't",01:16:48.070,01:16:51.330
"know what that engine is--
that takes heat QH here, QC",01:16:51.330,01:16:58.930
"here, and does a
certain amount of work.",01:16:58.930,01:17:01.400
"Now I know that W
over QH is less than",01:17:04.590,01:17:14.990
or equal to 1 minus TH over TC.,01:17:14.990,01:17:19.140
"And W is really the same
thing as QH minus QC.",01:17:22.960,01:17:28.347
"So actually, I could
also have written this",01:17:32.010,01:17:34.912
"as 1 minus QC over QH is
less than 1 minus TC over TC.",01:17:34.912,01:17:43.380
"I can eliminate the 1,
and rearrange things, yes?",01:17:43.380,01:17:50.826
AUDIENCE: It's TC over TH.,01:17:50.826,01:17:52.820
"PROFESSOR: 1 minus TC over
TH, thank you very much.",01:17:52.820,01:17:55.550
"Yes, and if you ever
forget-- not that I forgot--",01:17:58.910,01:18:05.890
"I miswrote-- but something to
remember is that ultimately,",01:18:05.890,01:18:11.440
"I was kind of hinting this--
if you ever forget Q's are",01:18:11.440,01:18:18.370
proportional to T's.,01:18:18.370,01:18:21.960
"So what I have is that ideally,
QH will be proportional to TH.",01:18:21.960,01:18:30.260
QC will be proportional to TC.,01:18:30.260,01:18:32.940
"So the difference
between them would",01:18:32.940,01:18:34.710
"be proportional to
the differences.",01:18:34.710,01:18:37.270
"Also, that means that if I were
to rearrange this slightly,",01:18:37.270,01:18:41.110
"what I would get is that QH
over TH plus minus QC over TC",01:18:41.110,01:18:57.450
has to be negative.,01:18:57.450,01:18:58.641
"So this is just a rearrangement
of the whole thing.",01:19:01.530,01:19:05.710
"But this rearrangement--
I wrote this as minus",01:19:05.710,01:19:10.350
"QC so as to look at things from
the perspective of the engine.",01:19:10.350,01:19:16.980
"So the engine is something
that goes through a cycle.",01:19:16.980,01:19:20.850
"As part of that cycle,
it does some work.",01:19:20.850,01:19:24.920
"But what this
expression has to do",01:19:24.920,01:19:27.460
"is the heat that
goes into the system.",01:19:27.460,01:19:31.030
"So I can regard minus
QC as the heat that",01:19:31.030,01:19:34.770
"goes into the engine coming from
a reservoir of temperature TC,",01:19:34.770,01:19:40.220
"QH going through
the engine, coming",01:19:40.220,01:19:42.290
"from a reservoir
of temperature TH.",01:19:42.290,01:19:46.530
"And you have a
relation such as this",01:19:46.530,01:19:49.500
"because the efficiency
of any type of engine",01:19:49.500,01:19:53.310
"has to be less than this
efficiency of the Carnot engine",01:19:53.310,01:19:57.240
"that is stamped by the
corresponding temperatures.",01:19:57.240,01:20:01.090
"OK, now this is kind of limited.",01:20:01.090,01:20:03.900
"And in order to be able to
construct a general formula,",01:20:03.900,01:20:08.550
"we need to be able
to make statements",01:20:08.550,01:20:12.140
"that's are relevant to
arbitrary complex cycles",01:20:12.140,01:20:16.640
and complex behaviors.,01:20:16.640,01:20:20.440
"So what we will
start next time is",01:20:20.440,01:20:25.960
"to prove something
that ultimately",01:20:25.960,01:20:29.110
"will allow us to
quantify entropy.",01:20:29.110,01:20:31.880
"It's called Clausius'
Theorem, which",01:20:31.880,01:20:38.650
"states the following-- imagine
some kind of a generalization",01:20:38.650,01:20:44.310
"of your engine that takes place
in some multidimensional space.",01:20:44.310,01:20:49.845
"So rather than really
thinking about an engine,",01:20:49.845,01:20:53.220
"I want to think
about some substance.",01:20:53.220,01:20:56.730
"This was an ideal gas run
through some nice cycle.",01:20:56.730,01:21:00.630
"But I want to think
about some substance that",01:21:00.630,01:21:03.250
"is described by multiple
coordinate system.",01:21:03.250,01:21:07.140
"I take the system
from some point A,",01:21:07.140,01:21:11.768
"and the only requirement
that I place on it",01:21:11.768,01:21:15.440
"is that ultimately,
I do something,",01:21:15.440,01:21:18.590
"and I come back to
A. So it is a cycle.",01:21:18.590,01:21:23.070
"What I don't even
require is that this",01:21:23.070,01:21:26.340
"is a quasistatic process, so
that the intermediate stages",01:21:26.340,01:21:31.590
"are well-defined in
this coordinate space--",01:21:31.590,01:21:35.820
"OK, so for any arbitrary
cyclic transformation.",01:21:35.820,01:21:42.560
"OK, now this
transformation-- we'll do",01:21:42.560,01:21:47.110
"is that at various stages--
just like that simple example--",01:21:47.110,01:21:51.770
"we'll do work on
the environment,",01:21:51.770,01:21:53.500
take work from the environment.,01:21:53.500,01:21:55.370
"But most importantly
from our perspective,",01:21:55.370,01:21:58.330
"there will be heat
input into the system",01:21:58.330,01:22:03.300
at various stages of the cycle.,01:22:03.300,01:22:07.290
"And I'm going to look at it
from the perspective of what",01:22:07.290,01:22:11.410
"goes into the system,
just like in this engine.",01:22:11.410,01:22:14.850
"So sometimes maybe this
dQ is negative-- means",01:22:14.850,01:22:18.320
"that the system is
really releasing heat,",01:22:18.320,01:22:21.250
"just like this engine
was releasing the heat.",01:22:21.250,01:22:25.360
"Now, Clausius' Theorem
says that if you integrate",01:22:25.360,01:22:29.690
"all around the cycle,
these elements of heat",01:22:29.690,01:22:34.120
"that you input to the system
throughout various stages",01:22:34.120,01:22:39.430
"of the cyclic transformation,
and divide them by some T.",01:22:39.430,01:22:44.980
"And this is kind of something
that needs definition.",01:22:44.980,01:22:51.300
"And S is supposed to
parametrize the cycle.",01:22:51.300,01:22:54.200
"Let's say S goes from 0 to 1
as you go across the cycle.",01:22:54.200,01:22:58.580
Generalizing that is negative.,01:22:58.580,01:23:00.790
"Next time, we will see if this
system is non-equilibrium,",01:23:04.330,01:23:08.090
"what exactly I mean
by this T of S.",01:23:08.090,01:23:11.850
"And we will see, somehow,
that once I define this,",01:23:11.850,01:23:16.690
"by doing part of
this, I can actually",01:23:16.690,01:23:19.470
"define an entropy function
integral from A to B dQ over S,",01:23:19.470,01:23:24.610
"and complete the definition of
what needs to be put for the Q",01:23:24.610,01:23:30.020
"in order to give you an
expression for T. OK.",01:23:30.020,01:23:36.450
