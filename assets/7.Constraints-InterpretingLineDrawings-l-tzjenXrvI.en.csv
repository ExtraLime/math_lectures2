"PATRICK WINSTON: Many of you,
maybe most of you, will never",00:00:10.110,00:00:12.660
"have to work another search
problem by hand in your",00:00:12.660,00:00:14.850
natural life.,00:00:14.850,00:00:17.510
"Others will want to
take another run",00:00:17.510,00:00:19.870
at it on the final.,00:00:19.870,00:00:22.100
"I've been much criticized
for this way of doing",00:00:22.100,00:00:25.030
grading in the class.,00:00:25.030,00:00:26.000
"But the way I look at it is that
the relationship between",00:00:26.000,00:00:31.490
"students and instructors ought
to be less adversarial than it",00:00:31.490,00:00:34.330
"used to be in the good old days
when I was a student.",00:00:34.330,00:00:39.910
"I especially remember an
examination we took--",00:00:39.910,00:00:44.100
"all of us took-- on Rayleigh
scattering.",00:00:44.100,00:00:46.450
"That was 803, I think.",00:00:46.450,00:00:48.670
"And back in the old days, we
had to take four physics",00:00:48.670,00:00:51.720
"courses, not just two.",00:00:51.720,00:00:53.640
"And we had to take four math
courses, not just two.",00:00:53.640,00:00:57.100
Back in the days when--,00:00:57.100,00:00:59.830
"well, I was going to
say men were men.",00:00:59.830,00:01:01.450
"But most of us were
men in those days.",00:01:01.450,00:01:03.130
"I think we only had 20
women in our class.",00:01:03.130,00:01:06.110
"Anyway, we had a quiz on
Rayleigh scattering.",00:01:06.110,00:01:09.950
"And I thought, well, this
is pretty hard.",00:01:09.950,00:01:11.910
And then I got my quiz back.,00:01:11.910,00:01:16.790
26.,00:01:16.790,00:01:19.370
"I thought, well, I've
been found out.",00:01:19.370,00:01:22.730
I'm going to flunk out.,00:01:22.730,00:01:25.030
"My father will make me
go to law school.",00:01:25.030,00:01:28.350
"I'll never attract
anyone to marry.",00:01:28.350,00:01:31.810
Horrible things will happen.,00:01:31.810,00:01:34.480
"Then the instructor announced
the class average was 18.",00:01:34.480,00:01:36.885
"I was two standard deviations
above that.",00:01:36.885,00:01:39.220
"They gave us the same exam
two weeks later,",00:01:41.960,00:01:44.420
and accounts vary.,00:01:44.420,00:01:46.030
"Some people say that the class
average went down.",00:01:46.030,00:01:49.340
"Anyway, today we're going
to study some stuff.",00:01:49.340,00:01:51.720
"We're going to study some
stuff that will make it",00:01:54.760,00:01:56.780
"possible for you to understand
how you can do that",00:01:56.780,00:02:00.230
"computation in just a couple
of seconds, even with the",00:02:00.230,00:02:02.990
"delays introduced by
the redrawing.",00:02:02.990,00:02:06.610
Now this particular program--,00:02:06.610,00:02:09.660
"I'm not real sure and I don't
have a proof, but I think it",00:02:09.660,00:02:11.970
"will take more than the lifetime
of the universe to",00:02:11.970,00:02:15.530
"find a legitimate coloring of
the continental United States.",00:02:15.530,00:02:19.910
"But by the end of the next
class, you'll see how to do",00:02:19.910,00:02:21.860
"that lickety-split in just
couple of seconds, even with",00:02:21.860,00:02:24.820
the re-display delays.,00:02:24.820,00:02:26.580
"Now we could, of course,
do this in two ways.",00:02:31.750,00:02:36.590
"One way is I could start off
by saying, let C be a",00:02:36.590,00:02:39.950
"constraint satisfaction
problem and just",00:02:39.950,00:02:42.490
give you the result.,00:02:42.490,00:02:45.170
And anybody can do that.,00:02:45.170,00:02:46.950
That's great.,00:02:46.950,00:02:48.406
"And you needed to learn
some stuff that way.",00:02:48.406,00:02:53.030
"But there are some things that
you needed to learn, I think,",00:02:53.030,00:02:55.740
a different way.,00:02:55.740,00:02:56.630
"And that different way involves
my telling you the",00:02:56.630,00:02:59.100
"story of how it all
came to be.",00:02:59.100,00:03:01.750
"This is a new field, pretty
much, and therefore I know",00:03:01.750,00:03:06.440
most of the people in it.,00:03:06.440,00:03:07.730
"And I know all of the people
who did the work that I'm",00:03:07.730,00:03:09.730
going to tell you about today.,00:03:09.730,00:03:10.720
"I'm going to tell you a little
bit about the struggle for",00:03:10.720,00:03:13.220
"coming up with the ideas that
led to one of the most",00:03:13.220,00:03:23.160
"powerful methods you'll learn
about in the subject.",00:03:23.160,00:03:26.130
"It all has to do, originally,
with an attempt to make a",00:03:26.130,00:03:29.670
computer capable of seeing.,00:03:29.670,00:03:31.832
"And everybody said to
themselves, well, let's start",00:03:31.832,00:03:33.890
"with seeing simple things,
like children's blocks.",00:03:33.890,00:03:37.280
"And so Adolfo Guzman, a graduate
student of Marvin",00:03:37.280,00:03:40.040
"Minsky's, was charged with the
summer project, which led to",00:03:40.040,00:03:43.480
"his Ph.D. thesis, of writing a
program that could look at a",00:03:43.480,00:03:47.590
"line drawing and determine
how many objects",00:03:47.590,00:03:50.440
are in the line drawing.,00:03:50.440,00:03:52.730
"So for example, there behind my
outline is a line drawing.",00:03:52.730,00:04:00.870
"And you believe instantly that
there are two objects there,",00:04:00.870,00:04:06.400
"even though in some deep
sense, it's ambiguous.",00:04:06.400,00:04:08.690
"There are all sorts of ways
that you could, through",00:04:08.690,00:04:12.540
"trickery, arrange something with
even seven objects that",00:04:12.540,00:04:16.579
look that way.,00:04:16.579,00:04:17.709
"But most people would say
there are two objects.",00:04:17.709,00:04:21.269
"So Guzman set about the
problem of figuring",00:04:21.269,00:04:23.350
out how to do that.,00:04:23.350,00:04:24.650
"And then his work was followed
by Dave Huffman.",00:04:24.650,00:04:26.860
"And his work was followed
up by Dave Waltz.",00:04:26.860,00:04:29.440
"And his work was followed up by
Jane [? Froyter ?], who's",00:04:29.440,00:04:31.850
not listed there quite yet.,00:04:31.850,00:04:33.880
"And I want to tell you a little
bit of story how that",00:04:33.880,00:04:35.580
all happened.,00:04:35.580,00:04:37.510
"So Guzman took a lot
of pictures.",00:04:37.510,00:04:40.440
"He went to Boston Baby, the
precursor to Toys R Us,",00:04:40.440,00:04:44.870
"purchased a large block set on
a government contract, and",00:04:44.870,00:04:51.990
"went about the business of
taking a lot of pictures of",00:04:51.990,00:04:54.640
"them so he'd get a feel
for the domain.",00:04:54.640,00:04:57.390
"And eventually he decided that
he could build a program that",00:04:57.390,00:05:00.370
"could determine that there are
two objects here by using the",00:05:00.370,00:05:03.910
"lines as a quanta of evidence
about which faces belong",00:05:03.910,00:05:10.800
together in an object.,00:05:10.800,00:05:13.090
"So he said, after studying these
for a long time, that",00:05:13.090,00:05:16.870
"these drawings tend to have a
lot of arrow-type junctions",00:05:16.870,00:05:20.060
"and a lot of fork-type
junctions.",00:05:20.060,00:05:22.460
"And when you see an arrow, it's
a little bit of evidence",00:05:22.460,00:05:24.980
"that the objects on either
side of the shaft are the",00:05:24.980,00:05:27.490
"same-- the face on either side
of the shaft belong to the",00:05:27.490,00:05:30.010
same object.,00:05:30.010,00:05:31.880
"And over here, the fork-type
junction suggests that",00:05:31.880,00:05:37.590
"pairwise, three pairs
of faces seem to",00:05:37.590,00:05:40.590
belong to the same object.,00:05:40.590,00:05:42.910
"So with that idea, he could come
back to a drawing like",00:05:42.910,00:05:46.660
"this and start decorating it
with these so-called links,",00:05:46.660,00:05:49.570
"these quanta of evidence
that faces",00:05:49.570,00:05:53.090
belong to the same object.,00:05:53.090,00:05:54.340
"And if I've done it right,
you get something",00:06:00.408,00:06:02.200
that looks like so.,00:06:02.200,00:06:04.230
"It's a little hard to
see what's going on",00:06:04.230,00:06:06.650
on the drawing itself.,00:06:06.650,00:06:07.920
So let me number these.,00:06:07.920,00:06:09.170
"Now I have an
easier-to-deal-with picture.",00:06:26.550,00:06:29.180
"There are two links between
1 and 2 and 1 and 3.",00:06:29.180,00:06:35.080
One link between 2 and 3.,00:06:35.080,00:06:37.890
One between 2 and 4.,00:06:37.890,00:06:39.820
Two here.,00:06:39.820,00:06:41.470
Two here.,00:06:41.470,00:06:43.120
"And one each from
all of these.",00:06:43.120,00:06:46.700
"So Guzman produces this evidence
for how the problem",00:06:46.700,00:06:49.760
"ought to be solved and then he
begins to think about various",00:06:49.760,00:06:52.960
ways of using the evidence.,00:06:52.960,00:06:55.050
"So he could, and did, decide
that one link is enough to",00:06:55.050,00:07:01.830
"presume that the faces belong
to the same object.",00:07:01.830,00:07:04.720
"And you can see that that's
a little bit too liberal.",00:07:04.720,00:07:07.730
"Because that says
that the whole",00:07:07.730,00:07:08.840
thing is just one object.,00:07:08.840,00:07:11.710
"So Guzman rejected the one-link
theory and went to",00:07:11.710,00:07:17.695
the two-link theory.,00:07:17.695,00:07:18.945
"And the two-link theory says,
oh, well, let's see.",00:07:22.330,00:07:27.110
"If we insist that two links
should be there before we are",00:07:27.110,00:07:30.390
"willing to decide that it's the
same object, then these",00:07:30.390,00:07:35.910
"three faces are pulled together
into one object.",00:07:35.910,00:07:39.090
"These three are pulled together
into one object.",00:07:39.090,00:07:41.790
"But alas, 7 doesn't share two
links with anything, so it's",00:07:41.790,00:07:44.410
left dangling out there.,00:07:44.410,00:07:46.830
"So plainly, the two-link theory
is too conservative.",00:07:46.830,00:07:50.990
"So that as you would soon
discover in any [INAUDIBLE]",00:07:50.990,00:07:54.110
"project, would lead you to a
third theory, which is two",00:07:54.110,00:07:57.030
lengths repeated.,00:07:57.030,00:08:01.960
"So now that we've formed these
super regions, we can come",00:08:01.960,00:08:07.430
"back and say we'll merge super
regions if they're connected",00:08:07.430,00:08:11.270
together by two or more links.,00:08:11.270,00:08:14.130
"So nothing new happens
up here.",00:08:14.130,00:08:16.240
"But this super region
is joined at 7",00:08:16.240,00:08:19.440
by two or more links.,00:08:19.440,00:08:21.440
"So it pulls everything
together like so.",00:08:21.440,00:08:25.270
So that worked fine.,00:08:25.270,00:08:26.480
"Well, it didn't work fine.",00:08:26.480,00:08:27.480
"There were lots of examples
of situations",00:08:27.480,00:08:29.620
where it didn't work--,00:08:29.620,00:08:32.850
"in situations that were
considered nonsensical by us",00:08:32.850,00:08:36.230
"humans because it seemed silly,
the kind of conclusions",00:08:36.230,00:08:41.620
that it reached.,00:08:41.620,00:08:44.770
"So when Guzman presented this
work in his Ph.D. thesis",00:08:44.770,00:08:48.870
"defense, it's said--",00:08:48.870,00:08:52.830
"and who knows if it's true--
but it's said that Marvin",00:08:52.830,00:08:54.770
"Minsky thought it was
great work and we",00:08:54.770,00:08:56.630
should make him a professor.,00:08:56.630,00:08:59.250
"It happens that Dave Huffman was
also on the committee and",00:08:59.250,00:09:03.070
"said that it was ad hoc and the
thesis should be rejected.",00:09:03.070,00:09:07.440
"So we had two polar opposites
of impressions there.",00:09:07.440,00:09:10.580
"Dave Huffman, by the way--",00:09:10.580,00:09:11.920
"you've heard that name
before, I imagine.",00:09:11.920,00:09:15.160
"It's the guy who invented
Huffman coating as a term",00:09:15.160,00:09:18.830
"paper in a information theory
course taught by Bob Fano.",00:09:18.830,00:09:22.720
"He got an A, they say.",00:09:22.720,00:09:23.970
So Huffman didn't like it.,00:09:26.720,00:09:27.840
"He thought it was a little
bit too ad hoc.",00:09:27.840,00:09:29.860
It was too heuristic.,00:09:29.860,00:09:31.430
"It didn't take advantage
of anything we",00:09:31.430,00:09:33.365
might know about physics.,00:09:33.365,00:09:35.120
"And so people began to say,
well, why does it work?",00:09:35.120,00:09:37.500
And when does it not work?,00:09:37.500,00:09:39.570
"And that's just about the best
question you can answer in a",00:09:39.570,00:09:42.130
situation like this.,00:09:42.130,00:09:43.832
"And by playing with some more
of Guzman's pictures and",00:09:43.832,00:09:48.300
"reflecting on them, it turned
out that it worked because the",00:09:48.300,00:09:50.870
"world is full of three-face
junctions.",00:09:50.870,00:09:53.670
"Or let me say three-face
vertexes because they're out",00:09:58.350,00:10:01.180
there in the world.,00:10:01.180,00:10:02.940
"We'll reserve the word junction
for something else.",00:10:02.940,00:10:06.950
"And three-face vertexes
generally project into either",00:10:06.950,00:10:12.540
an arrow or a fork.,00:10:12.540,00:10:16.430
"So Guzman's whole program worked
on the weak backward",00:10:16.430,00:10:21.410
"conclusion that if you see one
of those, it probably came",00:10:21.410,00:10:24.700
from one of these.,00:10:24.700,00:10:25.890
So this is in the drawing.,00:10:25.890,00:10:27.320
That's in the world.,00:10:27.320,00:10:29.160
"So by a process that's neither
deduction or induction, but",00:10:29.160,00:10:32.130
"rather abduction, you see
one of those guys.",00:10:32.130,00:10:35.410
"And you say, well, they often
come from three-face vertexes",00:10:35.410,00:10:38.840
"in the world, so if you see one,
it probably came from a",00:10:38.840,00:10:41.610
"three-face vertex
in the world.",00:10:41.610,00:10:42.670
That's abduction.,00:10:42.670,00:10:45.520
"So once Huffman saw all that,
being a mathematician, he",00:10:45.520,00:10:51.670
"began to think about how one
might develop a different and",00:10:51.670,00:10:55.135
better theory.,00:10:55.135,00:10:56.430
"But we have to recognize that
all this work started off with",00:10:56.430,00:11:02.510
"the efforts of Guzman, who
was an experimentalist.",00:11:02.510,00:11:05.496
"And Huffman was a
mathematician.",00:11:13.610,00:11:16.775
"So naturally, they approached
the problem differently.",00:11:20.460,00:11:25.520
"So Huffman says, I'm not going
to concern myself too much",00:11:25.520,00:11:29.140
"with the actual problem that
Guzman was trying to solve.",00:11:29.140,00:11:32.600
"Rather, I'm going to work in a
very simple world, which I can",00:11:32.600,00:11:35.750
deal with mathematically.,00:11:35.750,00:11:38.390
"So he decided that he was going
to work in a world which",00:11:38.390,00:11:41.560
had several characteristics.,00:11:41.560,00:11:44.490
"Characteristic number one was
that the world would be",00:11:44.490,00:11:47.760
presented in general position.,00:11:47.760,00:11:49.550
"That is to say, no
screw cases.",00:11:58.969,00:12:02.190
"So if you see a cube, it's
going to look like this.",00:12:02.190,00:12:05.920
"And it's not going to
look like this.",00:12:09.660,00:12:14.540
So that's out.,00:12:14.540,00:12:15.970
And this is in.,00:12:15.970,00:12:17.360
"And the idea here is that that's
not general position,",00:12:17.360,00:12:19.550
"because if you perturb your
point of view a little bit,",00:12:19.550,00:12:21.930
you'll change those T junctions,00:12:21.930,00:12:23.340
into forks and arrows.,00:12:23.340,00:12:25.810
"So we know it had to deal
with those kinds of",00:12:25.810,00:12:27.430
weird kinds of cases.,00:12:27.430,00:12:31.210
"So that's presumption
number one.",00:12:31.210,00:12:34.820
"Presumption number two is that
we're going to be dealing with",00:12:34.820,00:12:38.760
a world that's trihedral.,00:12:38.760,00:12:40.010
"That means all vertexes out
there are going to be formed",00:12:45.650,00:12:49.080
from three planes.,00:12:49.080,00:12:50.330
"So you're going to have the
intersection of three planes.",00:12:52.770,00:12:55.720
"So how many kinds of junctions
can you see if the world is",00:12:55.720,00:12:58.840
"composed that way is the
question that Huffman sent",00:12:58.840,00:13:04.040
himself upon.,00:13:04.040,00:13:06.225
"The next assumption was that
there are going to be four",00:13:06.225,00:13:10.990
kinds of lines.,00:13:10.990,00:13:11.840
"See, Guzman only recognized
two kinds of lines-- lines",00:13:11.840,00:13:14.820
"that have a length and lines
that don't have a link.",00:13:14.820,00:13:17.350
"And they don't have very much to
do with the physical world.",00:13:17.350,00:13:20.160
"So Huffman says, I want to get
the constraint out of the",00:13:20.160,00:13:22.060
physical world.,00:13:22.060,00:13:23.610
"So I'm going to deal with
four kinds of lines--",00:13:23.610,00:13:26.590
"concave, convex, and boundary.",00:13:26.590,00:13:34.660
"So each of those kinds
of lines is going to",00:13:42.820,00:13:46.030
have its own notation.,00:13:46.030,00:13:47.240
"We'll call the convex lines
plus, the concave lines minus,",00:13:47.240,00:13:52.080
"and a boundary lines are going
to get an arrow on them,",00:13:52.080,00:13:54.600
"depending on which side
of the object--",00:13:54.600,00:14:00.330
"which side you would see the
object if you walk along the",00:14:00.330,00:14:02.510
"direction of this
little arrow.",00:14:02.510,00:14:05.364
STUDENT: Question.,00:14:05.364,00:14:06.614
"Which is concave and
which is convex?",00:14:11.220,00:14:12.684
"You said something and you
wrote the opposite.",00:14:12.684,00:14:14.636
"PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, sorry.",00:14:14.636,00:14:15.612
Thank you.,00:14:15.612,00:14:18.060
"So concave, convex,
and boundary.",00:14:18.060,00:14:19.480
Thank you.,00:14:19.480,00:14:20.270
"So this down here, that's
a concave line.",00:14:20.270,00:14:23.345
"And that would get
a minus label.",00:14:23.345,00:14:26.550
"Oh, I don't know.",00:14:26.550,00:14:28.190
"These lines you're seeing here,
if there were stuff",00:14:28.190,00:14:31.290
"behind them instead of
me, then all those",00:14:31.290,00:14:33.440
would be convex lines.,00:14:33.440,00:14:36.960
"Many times you see
a boundary line.",00:14:36.960,00:14:38.220
"For example, now you don't see
both sides of that line down",00:14:38.220,00:14:41.720
here at the bottom.,00:14:41.720,00:14:42.370
So that's a boundary line.,00:14:42.370,00:14:43.750
"And the arrow would point in
that direction, so as to keep",00:14:43.750,00:14:46.250
"the stuff of the object on the
right as you walk along a kind",00:14:46.250,00:14:49.330
of mathematical convention.,00:14:49.330,00:14:52.160
"So three kinds of lines,
four kinds of labels.",00:14:52.160,00:14:54.710
"And there's some things
left out.",00:14:54.710,00:14:56.620
"That's because Huffman wanted
to keep his problem simple,",00:14:56.620,00:14:59.860
"something he could
manage by hand.",00:14:59.860,00:15:01.690
What's left out?,00:15:01.690,00:15:02.780
Cracks are left out.,00:15:02.780,00:15:04.060
Shadows are left out.,00:15:04.060,00:15:07.160
"There's a presumption that
there's nothing of interest",00:15:07.160,00:15:10.750
here with respect to that.,00:15:10.750,00:15:12.000
"So let's have a little
vocabulary before I go on.",00:15:14.940,00:15:20.260
And I'll try to stick to it.,00:15:20.260,00:15:21.560
"But there's the stuff out there,
and that consists of",00:15:21.560,00:15:24.100
vertexes and edges.,00:15:24.100,00:15:29.540
"And over here, on the
blackboard, we'll have",00:15:32.570,00:15:35.700
junctions and lines.,00:15:35.700,00:15:42.950
"And I'll try to stick
to that vocabulary.",00:15:42.950,00:15:44.490
All right?,00:15:44.490,00:15:44.870
"Yes, Christopher?",00:15:44.870,00:15:45.660
"STUDENT: Didn't you say there
were four types of lines?",00:15:45.660,00:15:47.590
"PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, there
are four kinds of--",00:15:47.590,00:15:49.630
"the question is, didn't
I say there were",00:15:49.630,00:15:50.940
four kinds of lines?,00:15:50.940,00:15:51.840
"There are three kinds of lines,
but since we can label",00:15:51.840,00:15:53.860
"a boundary line in
either direction,",00:15:53.860,00:15:55.100
we have four labels.,00:15:55.100,00:15:55.980
OK?,00:15:55.980,00:15:58.010
"It depends on which side of the
object the stuff is on.",00:15:58.010,00:16:01.210
"And that will be clear,
I think, as",00:16:01.210,00:16:02.765
soon as I do an example.,00:16:02.765,00:16:05.670
"So one, two, three
assumptions.",00:16:05.670,00:16:08.650
A little bit of vocabulary.,00:16:08.650,00:16:11.170
"So we have the possibility of
making a complete catalog.",00:16:11.170,00:16:16.280
This is so simple.,00:16:16.280,00:16:17.220
"We have the possibility of
making a complete catalog of",00:16:17.220,00:16:20.200
"all the ways that lines can
come together to form a",00:16:20.200,00:16:22.510
"junction with respect to
these four labels.",00:16:22.510,00:16:26.576
"Now at first you might say, oh
my god, that will take a",00:16:26.576,00:16:31.730
couple of years.,00:16:31.730,00:16:34.230
"But maybe it won't take
a couple of years.",00:16:34.230,00:16:36.380
"And in the end, to perhaps your
surprise, you discover",00:16:36.380,00:16:43.320
"that there are only 18 ways to
arrange the labels around a",00:16:43.320,00:16:47.660
junction in this world.,00:16:47.660,00:16:49.760
Everything else is excluded.,00:16:49.760,00:16:52.220
"If you have something that's not
in the set we're going to",00:16:52.220,00:16:54.040
"produce now, it can't be built
with trihedral vertexes.",00:16:54.040,00:16:58.930
"So I've listed up there six L's,
five forks, four T's, and",00:17:01.600,00:17:10.400
three arrows.,00:17:10.400,00:17:12.650
"Let's see if I can figure out
why there are those 18 and",00:17:12.650,00:17:16.319
nothing else.,00:17:16.319,00:17:17.569
"Well, if we have three vertexes
coming together, that",00:17:19.910,00:17:25.300
"means there are eight
octants, right?",00:17:25.300,00:17:28.010
"And the stuff of the object may
fill 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7",00:17:28.010,00:17:32.840
or all eight octants.,00:17:32.840,00:17:35.030
"Now of course, if you
fill all eight",00:17:35.030,00:17:36.450
"octants, there's no junction.",00:17:36.450,00:17:37.330
"So we don't consider
that case.",00:17:37.330,00:17:40.250
"If we don't fill any the
octants, there's no junction.",00:17:40.250,00:17:43.080
There's no vertex.,00:17:43.080,00:17:43.890
"So we don't consider
that case.",00:17:43.890,00:17:46.540
"But if just one of the eight
octants is filled with stuff,",00:17:46.540,00:17:51.080
"then we can look at
it from any of the",00:17:51.080,00:17:53.130
seven remaining octants.,00:17:53.130,00:17:55.760
"So right now, you're looking
at it from one of the seven",00:17:55.760,00:17:59.360
remaining octants.,00:17:59.360,00:18:00.880
"And if I'm not mistaken,
you're going to see a",00:18:00.880,00:18:02.750
"fork-style junction
there, right?",00:18:02.750,00:18:05.800
"And you're going to see a
fork-style junction in which",00:18:05.800,00:18:07.600
all of the edges are convex.,00:18:07.600,00:18:09.905
"An unfortunate selection of
names, because the linguists",00:18:14.350,00:18:16.850
"tell me that we index
all of our words",00:18:16.850,00:18:18.600
by the first forename.,00:18:18.600,00:18:19.500
"And those have the same
first forename, so",00:18:19.500,00:18:21.210
they're easily confused.,00:18:21.210,00:18:23.840
"So here's a fork-style
junction.",00:18:23.840,00:18:25.830
"And we know that one way that's
legitimate for the",00:18:25.830,00:18:29.160
"lines to come in is
with four pluses.",00:18:29.160,00:18:33.050
"Now that's not the only
way you can see that.",00:18:33.050,00:18:35.120
And here's another way.,00:18:35.120,00:18:37.170
"There's an L-style
junction, right?",00:18:37.170,00:18:39.200
"And both of those are
boundary lines.",00:18:39.200,00:18:41.650
"And we want to draw the boundary
line indicators on",00:18:41.650,00:18:45.810
"there so that if we walk along
the arrows, the stuff of the",00:18:45.810,00:18:49.550
object would be on the right.,00:18:49.550,00:18:52.180
"So I suppose, to make it easier
to me do my drawing, I",00:18:52.180,00:18:54.730
should look at it this way.,00:18:54.730,00:18:56.520
"And then I would say, well, that
has to be a legitimate",00:18:56.520,00:19:00.650
way of labeling a junction.,00:19:00.650,00:19:03.350
Are there any more?,00:19:03.350,00:19:05.160
"Well, there's seven altogether,
but many of them",00:19:05.160,00:19:08.230
are the same.,00:19:08.230,00:19:09.760
"There is one more that's a
little different, though.",00:19:09.760,00:19:12.010
"I can hold this guy
up like so.",00:19:12.010,00:19:14.470
"And if I'm holding at the right
angle for you, you see",00:19:14.470,00:19:17.070
"an arrow-style junction,
right?",00:19:17.070,00:19:19.020
"Two boundaries, and the
barb is convex.",00:19:19.020,00:19:21.275
"So in this particular
case, I've got that.",00:19:24.430,00:19:27.143
I've got that.,00:19:27.143,00:19:28.365
And I've got a plus there.,00:19:28.365,00:19:31.840
"And that's there happen to be
for the one octant filled with",00:19:31.840,00:19:34.350
stuff case.,00:19:34.350,00:19:36.100
"I happen to be able to
reverse this, though.",00:19:36.100,00:19:37.890
"And here's the seven octants
filled case.",00:19:37.890,00:19:41.200
"So that tells us that it's
possible to have a vertex out",00:19:41.200,00:19:44.940
"there in a space that when
reduced to a junction on the",00:19:44.940,00:19:48.340
"board deserves three minus
labels, because all of these",00:19:48.340,00:19:51.760
"that you're seeing
now are concave.",00:19:51.760,00:19:54.680
"So another fork-style junction
looks like so.",00:19:54.680,00:20:00.920
"And since there's only one
octant to look at from, that",00:20:00.920,00:20:06.210
"completes our analysis of the
seven octants filled case.",00:20:06.210,00:20:11.280
"Now we have a couple of other
possibilities here.",00:20:11.280,00:20:14.360
"We might have five octants
filled with stuff.",00:20:14.360,00:20:16.440
"So that means there are three
octants that we can look from.",00:20:22.770,00:20:27.420
"So let's suppose that
these little chalk",00:20:27.420,00:20:29.030
pieces are little people.,00:20:29.030,00:20:32.860
"And they're looking at this
junction down there, where",00:20:32.860,00:20:38.580
"this white object is fused
with the table.",00:20:38.580,00:20:41.930
"I'm fusing it with the table
because I want to consider it",00:20:41.930,00:20:43.760
to be one object.,00:20:43.760,00:20:45.100
"We can view it from the three
objects indicated by those",00:20:45.100,00:20:47.280
three little chalk pieces.,00:20:47.280,00:20:49.190
"And ask ourselves, well, in the
event that we look at it",00:20:49.190,00:20:52.580
"from those three places,
what do we see?",00:20:52.580,00:20:55.110
"And if we look at it from the
perspective of the piece of",00:20:55.110,00:20:59.000
purple chalk--,00:20:59.000,00:20:59.780
"I'll have to walk around
and be sure--",00:20:59.780,00:21:01.610
"looks like an arrow
junction with two",00:21:01.610,00:21:03.960
concaves and a convex.,00:21:03.960,00:21:05.575
Did I get that right?,00:21:09.020,00:21:10.270
"So I'm looking at it from
this perspective.",00:21:12.460,00:21:14.080
It's an arrow.,00:21:14.080,00:21:15.210
"This is convex and these two
are concave because I fused",00:21:15.210,00:21:18.460
the paper box with the table.,00:21:18.460,00:21:22.350
"Looking at it from the
perspective of this blue guy--",00:21:22.350,00:21:24.840
"let me rotate it so you can have
a better understanding of",00:21:24.840,00:21:27.580
the blue guy--,00:21:27.580,00:21:28.610
"it looks like a concave
line and a boundary.",00:21:28.610,00:21:32.250
"So it's an L. And this
one is a boundary.",00:21:32.250,00:21:36.750
And that's concave.,00:21:36.750,00:21:38.400
"And by a kind of symmetry, we're
also going to get that",00:21:38.400,00:21:41.710
"one from the other side, the
third of the three octants.",00:21:41.710,00:21:46.250
"Well, we're off and running.",00:21:46.250,00:21:47.300
"But we still have an
awful lot to go.",00:21:47.300,00:21:50.660
"And we could manage to deal with
it by thinking about this",00:21:50.660,00:21:56.760
object once again.,00:21:56.760,00:21:59.640
"But instead of this situation
out here, to turn it around",00:21:59.640,00:22:06.290
and look at this vertex.,00:22:06.290,00:22:09.310
"Think about the junctions
that it can produce.",00:22:09.310,00:22:11.580
I think I'll do that for you.,00:22:11.580,00:22:12.860
"Because you really have to play
with this and move it",00:22:12.860,00:22:14.610
"around a little bit to see how
things are going to look.",00:22:14.610,00:22:19.000
"So let me think about how that's
going to work out.",00:22:19.000,00:22:23.480
"I know that one of the
possibilities is going",00:22:23.480,00:22:27.150
to look like so.,00:22:27.150,00:22:29.480
"I might as well not hide
that from you.",00:22:29.480,00:22:31.830
"It's going to be what happens
when there's a little man",00:22:31.830,00:22:34.080
looking up at the junction.,00:22:34.080,00:22:36.770
"And this one's going
to be minus.",00:22:36.770,00:22:39.720
"And now we've got two more
that are just like that.",00:22:39.720,00:22:43.954
Look like so.,00:22:43.954,00:22:45.204
"And you say, oops.",00:22:50.980,00:22:52.270
"You say, aren't those
just a rotational",00:23:01.820,00:23:04.230
variance of each other?,00:23:04.230,00:23:05.780
And the answer is sure.,00:23:05.780,00:23:07.530
"I write them all down, because
if you get a fork-style",00:23:07.530,00:23:11.280
"junction in space, there are
three different ways it could",00:23:11.280,00:23:13.870
be labeled.,00:23:13.870,00:23:14.300
"Depending on which of
the lines you put",00:23:14.300,00:23:18.640
the minus label on.,00:23:18.640,00:23:20.160
So that takes care of that.,00:23:25.680,00:23:26.920
"And then there's one more of
these fork-style junctions.",00:23:26.920,00:23:30.310
"And that's plus, plus, minus
that derives from this case.",00:23:30.310,00:23:36.200
"And there appear to
be three more of",00:23:36.200,00:23:39.150
these L-style junctions.,00:23:39.150,00:23:41.120
"And they look like, let's
see, plus, then plus.",00:23:41.120,00:23:50.280
"I'm having to think this
through as I go.",00:23:50.280,00:23:53.860
And then--,00:23:53.860,00:23:55.110
and that's it.,00:23:57.910,00:24:00.490
"Well, what about the T's?",00:24:00.490,00:24:01.980
"Well, in this world, the only
way you can get a T is if some",00:24:01.980,00:24:05.420
"object is obscuring
another object.",00:24:05.420,00:24:07.605
"And if an object is obscuring
a line, it can",00:24:07.605,00:24:10.050
be any line at all.,00:24:10.050,00:24:12.130
"So that's why the four remaining
ones are easy beyond",00:24:12.130,00:24:15.980
description to label.,00:24:15.980,00:24:19.470
"And of course, the cross
pieces of the T are all",00:24:19.470,00:24:22.820
"boundary lines, with the
obscuring object on the right.",00:24:22.820,00:24:25.930
Now let's see.,00:24:29.720,00:24:30.520
"We've taken care now of the one,
three, five, and seven",00:24:30.520,00:24:37.110
octants filled cases.,00:24:37.110,00:24:38.480
"What about two, four, and six?",00:24:38.480,00:24:42.060
"Well, it turns out you can have
vertexes that are made",00:24:42.060,00:24:46.480
that way too.,00:24:46.480,00:24:47.930
"But they will have more
than three faces.",00:24:47.930,00:24:50.180
They'll have six faces.,00:24:50.180,00:24:51.730
"They'll be like what happens
when an object comes together",00:24:51.730,00:24:57.255
"at a point, like so.",00:24:57.255,00:24:58.505
Like that.,00:25:01.308,00:25:02.760
"You can play with it a little
bit and see that if you have",00:25:02.760,00:25:04.500
"two, four, or six objects filled
with stuff, there are",00:25:04.500,00:25:07.090
more than three faces.,00:25:07.090,00:25:08.010
"So we're going to
ignore those.",00:25:08.010,00:25:09.690
"So our constraint is going to
be a little more severe than",00:25:09.690,00:25:16.040
"would be suggested by the
terminology Huffman uses.",00:25:16.040,00:25:18.640
"They're going to be trihedral
all right, but they're also",00:25:18.640,00:25:20.850
going to be three faces.,00:25:20.850,00:25:22.100
"So we went to a lot
of work there.",00:25:25.620,00:25:26.830
But what have we discovered?,00:25:26.830,00:25:27.670
"We've discovered that in this
world, this is a complete,",00:25:27.670,00:25:31.120
"100% percent, nothing excluded,
nothing else can be",00:25:31.120,00:25:33.970
"there, catalog of all possible
ways the junctions can have",00:25:33.970,00:25:38.680
"line labels arranged
around them.",00:25:38.680,00:25:41.770
"There's nothing else
in this world.",00:25:41.770,00:25:44.010
"So that's a very powerful
constraint.",00:25:44.010,00:25:46.970
"So now let's see what
we can do with it.",00:25:46.970,00:25:48.620
"This example is usually more fun
when the Red Sox are doing",00:25:53.770,00:25:56.340
"better, but they're not.",00:25:56.340,00:25:58.340
Yet we'll use it any way.,00:25:58.340,00:25:59.870
"We're going to start
with an object that",00:25:59.870,00:26:01.870
looks like home plate.,00:26:01.870,00:26:03.120
And I'll ask you the question.,00:26:10.990,00:26:12.900
Can you build one of those?,00:26:12.900,00:26:16.210
I don't know.,00:26:16.210,00:26:17.940
Let's give it a shot.,00:26:17.940,00:26:20.640
"We're going to assume that
this object is hanging,",00:26:20.640,00:26:22.790
floating in space.,00:26:22.790,00:26:24.250
"So therefore, all of these lines
around the boundary are",00:26:24.250,00:26:28.130
"boundary lines, like so.",00:26:28.130,00:26:31.490
"Now that gets us off to a good--
it's just hanging in",00:26:31.490,00:26:34.140
"space, Christopher, all right?",00:26:34.140,00:26:35.040
You look confused.,00:26:35.040,00:26:35.570
"It's just hanging in space so
that all the lines around the",00:26:35.570,00:26:38.230
"edges are places where you see
only one side has stuff on it.",00:26:38.230,00:26:45.770
"So that enables us to just
quickly run around the",00:26:45.770,00:26:49.650
"periphery and put arrow labels
on all those outside lines.",00:26:49.650,00:26:54.210
"Now we have a lot
of arrow-style",00:26:54.210,00:26:55.690
junctions on the boundary.,00:26:55.690,00:26:57.020
That's commonly the case.,00:26:57.020,00:26:59.340
"So we can run over to our
catalog of all possible",00:26:59.340,00:27:02.900
"labels, and we see that if we
have an arrow with boundaries",00:27:02.900,00:27:07.410
"on its barbs, there's
only one of those.",00:27:07.410,00:27:10.490
"So I know instantly that there
must be a plus on the shaft.",00:27:10.490,00:27:14.790
"So we can come back here and
take all these arrows here.",00:27:14.790,00:27:18.070
"And label them with plus
lines on their shafts.",00:27:18.070,00:27:22.310
"Now a line can't change its
nature along its length.",00:27:22.310,00:27:25.810
"So if it's a plus line on one
end, it's going to be a plus",00:27:25.810,00:27:28.390
line on the other end.,00:27:28.390,00:27:29.705
All right?,00:27:29.705,00:27:32.970
So what else can we do?,00:27:32.970,00:27:34.220
"Here deep inside is a
fork-style junction.",00:27:34.220,00:27:37.840
"It's got convex markers on
both of those two lines.",00:27:37.840,00:27:43.840
"So we go over to our catalog and
say, what can we say about",00:27:43.840,00:27:47.130
"it, given that there are pluses
on two of its lines?",00:27:47.130,00:27:50.660
"Whoop, that means that
the third one has to",00:27:50.660,00:27:52.230
be a plus as well.,00:27:52.230,00:27:53.480
And now we're done.,00:27:57.820,00:27:58.390
We've labeled everything.,00:27:58.390,00:27:59.370
Except--,00:27:59.370,00:28:00.830
look at this.,00:28:00.830,00:28:02.540
What about that guy?,00:28:02.540,00:28:05.930
"There's an L-style junction
with pluses on",00:28:05.930,00:28:08.140
both of its two lines.,00:28:08.140,00:28:10.240
"Is there one of those
in my catalog?",00:28:10.240,00:28:13.020
No.,00:28:13.020,00:28:14.280
"Therefore, I haven't passed
a necessary condition for",00:28:14.280,00:28:18.180
"constructability in the
world that I've made.",00:28:18.180,00:28:21.020
You can't make it.,00:28:21.020,00:28:22.080
You can't construct it.,00:28:22.080,00:28:23.330
"So Huffman's ideas give us a
way of testing something to",00:28:25.950,00:28:30.470
"see if it's not possible for
it to be in this world.",00:28:30.470,00:28:35.600
"If it passes the test, does
that mean it's possible?",00:28:41.360,00:28:45.200
No.,00:28:45.200,00:28:45.740
"It's a necessary but not
sufficient condition.",00:28:45.740,00:28:48.740
On this one--,00:28:48.740,00:28:51.730
blue-collar occupation--,00:28:51.730,00:28:53.580
"on this one, maybe it
will help if we",00:28:53.580,00:28:55.910
put in another line.,00:28:55.910,00:28:58.060
"For example, we could
put a line like so.",00:28:58.060,00:29:01.100
You feel better about it now?,00:29:01.100,00:29:03.760
I don't know.,00:29:03.760,00:29:04.530
Let's see.,00:29:04.530,00:29:06.290
"This has to be a plus for the
same argument we used on",00:29:06.290,00:29:09.390
several other arrows before.,00:29:09.390,00:29:11.200
"That gives us an arrow-style
junction here with a plus on",00:29:11.200,00:29:15.120
everything.,00:29:15.120,00:29:17.140
"Is there such a junction
label?",00:29:17.140,00:29:20.298
No.,00:29:20.298,00:29:21.510
We lose.,00:29:21.510,00:29:22.445
It doesn't help.,00:29:22.445,00:29:23.670
"You think you can make
it, but you can't.",00:29:23.670,00:29:27.632
"STUDENT: You could actually
construct it as",00:29:27.632,00:29:29.272
"a 3-D object, though.",00:29:29.272,00:29:30.584
"PATRICK WINSTON: He
thinks you can",00:29:34.260,00:29:34.900
construct it as a 3-D object.,00:29:34.900,00:29:37.570
"Let me show you the next
example, Christopher.",00:29:37.570,00:29:40.790
Consider this example.,00:29:40.790,00:29:42.040
Can you make that?,00:29:52.956,00:29:56.570
Your intuition is yes.,00:29:56.570,00:29:58.300
So let's label it.,00:29:58.300,00:29:59.550
"Oh, I've already lost.",00:30:11.126,00:30:12.480
"We just boost that up a
little bit to make the",00:30:16.500,00:30:18.890
situation more clear.,00:30:18.890,00:30:20.140
"So already, I've got myself in
a situation where I can't",00:30:25.780,00:30:28.670
label that.,00:30:28.670,00:30:31.230
"But you feel like
you can make it.",00:30:31.230,00:30:33.090
So what's wrong?,00:30:33.090,00:30:36.290
What's wrong is--,00:30:36.290,00:30:37.560
"what, Elliott?",00:30:37.560,00:30:38.220
"STUDENT: You have
an obscured--",00:30:38.220,00:30:39.350
"or, we're presuming that we have
an obscured [INAUDIBLE]",00:30:39.350,00:30:44.126
"alley from the upper-left corner
to the [INAUDIBLE].",00:30:44.126,00:30:51.400
"PATRICK WINSTON: Putting a
little interpretation on what",00:30:51.400,00:30:53.490
Elliott has said.,00:30:53.490,00:30:55.660
"If you look at this situation
back here, you get a",00:30:55.660,00:30:59.410
four-faced junction there.,00:30:59.410,00:31:02.600
So you can make it.,00:31:02.600,00:31:03.700
But not with three faces.,00:31:03.700,00:31:06.000
"So some of these look like
you could make it.",00:31:06.000,00:31:10.030
"But they can't be labeled
because you need more than",00:31:10.030,00:31:12.900
four faces at a junction.,00:31:12.900,00:31:16.300
"And we can carry that
idea back here.",00:31:16.300,00:31:18.650
You can make this OK.,00:31:18.650,00:31:19.780
"But this junction, you've got
two in the back and two here.",00:31:19.780,00:31:22.810
So it has four faces.,00:31:22.810,00:31:24.970
Same idea.,00:31:24.970,00:31:27.720
"So that's Guzman's
contribution.",00:31:27.720,00:31:37.970
That's Huffman's contribution.,00:31:37.970,00:31:40.080
Huffman was a mathematician.,00:31:40.080,00:31:41.900
"But we wanted to build robots
back in those days.",00:31:41.900,00:31:43.900
"And neither one of these guys
solved the problem of dealing",00:31:43.900,00:31:46.790
"with natural objects with
shadows, with cracks, with",00:31:46.790,00:31:51.530
"more than trihedral vertexes
in space, and",00:31:51.530,00:31:55.710
what to do about that?,00:31:55.710,00:31:57.585
"Well, that was a problem that
another graduate student,",00:31:57.585,00:32:02.110
"David Waltz, set
about to solve.",00:32:02.110,00:32:03.840
"So Waltz decided that he would
not be content unless he added",00:32:06.820,00:32:15.310
"cracks, shadows, non-trihedral
vertexes.",00:32:15.310,00:32:25.170
Uh--,00:32:29.123,00:32:30.560
"yeah, non-trihedral vertexes.",00:32:30.560,00:32:31.810
And light.,00:32:38.330,00:32:39.580
"These considerations led
Waltz to go from",00:32:42.210,00:32:48.630
four labels to 50-plus.,00:32:48.630,00:32:53.450
"Because he had to pack a lot
of information into each of",00:32:53.450,00:32:55.810
the labels he put on a line.,00:32:55.810,00:32:57.760
"What kind of light
was on the right?",00:32:57.760,00:32:59.110
"What kind of light
was on the left?",00:32:59.110,00:33:00.310
Maybe it's a crack.,00:33:00.310,00:33:01.140
Maybe it's a crack that--,00:33:01.140,00:33:02.630
all sorts of considerations.,00:33:02.630,00:33:05.850
"Here we had 18 ways that
lines can come",00:33:05.850,00:33:08.360
together around junctions.,00:33:08.360,00:33:09.610
"That went to thousands of
junctions in Waltz's world.",00:33:12.060,00:33:18.130
So here's Guzman.,00:33:18.130,00:33:19.380
"He writes a program that
sort of works.",00:33:22.630,00:33:24.410
"Down below, we have Huffman.",00:33:27.500,00:33:29.500
"Huffman, who has a theory but
solves the wrong problem.",00:33:41.990,00:33:48.090
"So here comes Waltz, and he's
trying to solve the right",00:33:48.090,00:33:50.500
"problem with a satisfying
theory that has a",00:33:50.500,00:33:55.810
generalizable principle.,00:33:55.810,00:33:57.720
"So when we get all through
this, we'll talk about",00:33:57.720,00:34:00.710
criteria for success.,00:34:00.710,00:34:01.960
"And we'll conclude that to
have a really successful",00:34:01.960,00:34:04.060
"thing, you need a problem,
to start with.",00:34:04.060,00:34:07.670
You need a method that works.,00:34:07.670,00:34:08.790
"And you have to show
that it works",00:34:08.790,00:34:09.850
because of some principal.,00:34:09.850,00:34:12.040
"So Guzman had the problem and
something that worked.",00:34:12.040,00:34:17.040
"Huffman had a method which
worked on the wrong problem.",00:34:17.040,00:34:20.219
"And it's left to Waltz to
bring it all together.",00:34:20.219,00:34:22.790
So Waltz does all this work.,00:34:22.790,00:34:24.770
"And now he has, instead at 18
labels, he has thousands.",00:34:24.770,00:34:28.530
"Instead of four-line labels,
he has more than 50.",00:34:28.530,00:34:32.469
"So naturally, it becomes
difficult to",00:34:32.469,00:34:34.280
work these by hand.,00:34:34.280,00:34:36.659
"We were able to work those
Huffman examples by hand.",00:34:36.659,00:34:42.639
"We started with labeling
everything on the boundary and",00:34:42.639,00:34:45.019
worked our way in.,00:34:45.019,00:34:45.580
"There's no particular
method there.",00:34:45.580,00:34:46.960
"It was just easy to work
out the puzzle.",00:34:46.960,00:34:50.650
"But poor Waltz, he didn't
have that luxury.",00:34:50.650,00:34:55.500
"So he might have, in a typical
scene, he might have tens or",00:34:55.500,00:34:58.910
"even hundreds of junctions to
label and no easy way of",00:34:58.910,00:35:04.130
dealing with it.,00:35:04.130,00:35:04.930
"So naturally writes himself a
depth-first search program.",00:35:04.930,00:35:11.060
"So here is vertex, or rather
junction number 1.",00:35:11.060,00:35:19.420
"There are many choices for which
label can be used on it.",00:35:19.420,00:35:25.080
"And for each of those choices,
whatever he's decided junction",00:35:25.080,00:35:29.070
"number 2 is has its own suite
of possibilities.",00:35:29.070,00:35:34.090
"And so it becomes a
simple depth-first",00:35:34.090,00:35:35.670
"search problem, right?",00:35:35.670,00:35:39.040
"So in actuality, as
soon as Waltz--",00:35:39.040,00:35:42.580
"he was my office mate
at the time.",00:35:42.580,00:35:43.940
"I can tell you this
for a fact.",00:35:43.940,00:35:45.960
"As soon as he wrote this
program, he kept looking over",00:35:45.960,00:35:48.080
at the computer--,00:35:48.080,00:35:48.900
they were big in those days.,00:35:48.900,00:35:50.290
They all had lights.,00:35:50.290,00:35:51.540
"So you looked over at the
computer to see if the lights",00:35:51.540,00:35:53.270
were still blinking.,00:35:53.270,00:35:54.860
"Because he'd start this
depth-first search program up",00:35:54.860,00:35:58.290
and nothing would happen.,00:35:58.290,00:36:00.080
"He thought the computer
had crashed.",00:36:00.080,00:36:02.820
Nothing happened.,00:36:02.820,00:36:04.520
Why did nothing happen?,00:36:04.520,00:36:07.550
"Because the search base is
exponential and much too big",00:36:07.550,00:36:11.350
"for an ordinary computer,
or maybe",00:36:11.350,00:36:13.570
even an ordinary universe.,00:36:13.570,00:36:15.970
"So Waltz has to do
something else.",00:36:15.970,00:36:20.490
"He has to come up with a new
method for using all these",00:36:20.490,00:36:24.130
labels that he's--,00:36:24.130,00:36:27.080
"after about a year and a half's
worth of hard work,",00:36:27.080,00:36:29.410
"with lots of paper on his
desk in little blocks.",00:36:29.410,00:36:31.990
"After year and a half of hard
work getting all these",00:36:31.990,00:36:35.230
"junction labels figured out, he
then has to come up with a",00:36:35.230,00:36:37.560
"method for figuring out
how to use them.",00:36:37.560,00:36:40.850
"And so we don't know whether
to think his biggest",00:36:40.850,00:36:43.210
"contribution was that label
set or his method.",00:36:43.210,00:36:46.390
"And probably both deserve
about equal billing.",00:36:46.390,00:36:50.328
"Oh, I don't know how to explain
what Waltz did.",00:36:50.328,00:36:54.710
"Well, one way is to
do an example.",00:36:54.710,00:36:57.470
"And I think I will hazard
an example.",00:36:57.470,00:36:58.875
Let's see.,00:37:11.560,00:37:12.000
Let me find some space.,00:37:12.000,00:37:13.165
"I think I'm reduced to
going over here.",00:37:13.165,00:37:15.000
"But that will be convenient,
since the",00:37:15.000,00:37:16.835
line labels are here.,00:37:16.835,00:37:18.085
Here's my example.,00:37:24.380,00:37:25.630
"And you say, how can I give you
just part of a picture?",00:37:36.372,00:37:39.650
"Well, you can assume
I'm looking at",00:37:39.650,00:37:42.140
this through a window.,00:37:42.140,00:37:43.690
"So the edge of the window form
boundary lines, and they exert",00:37:43.690,00:37:46.290
"no constraint whatsoever
on what's behind them.",00:37:46.290,00:37:49.350
"So this is a legitimate
drawing to",00:37:49.350,00:37:50.760
have to think about.,00:37:50.760,00:37:53.470
"By the way, is this ambiguous?",00:37:53.470,00:37:54.950
"Or do you get a firm sense
that there's a unique",00:37:54.950,00:37:57.630
"interpretation of
all those lines?",00:37:57.630,00:38:00.650
"I think there's a unique
interpretation",00:38:00.650,00:38:02.760
of all those lines.,00:38:02.760,00:38:04.640
"What I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to solve this",00:38:04.640,00:38:07.130
"problem using Huffman's labels
but Waltz's method.",00:38:07.130,00:38:11.510
"Because I can't simulate on the
blackboard something with",00:38:11.510,00:38:14.900
"50 line types and thousands
of line junctions.",00:38:14.900,00:38:17.650
"So I'm going to use
Huffman's set to",00:38:17.650,00:38:20.950
demonstrate Waltz's algorithm.,00:38:20.950,00:38:23.390
"So Waltz's algorithm involves
starting out by plopping on",00:38:23.390,00:38:32.040
"some junction all of the
possible labels that the",00:38:32.040,00:38:39.080
answer has to be drawn from.,00:38:39.080,00:38:41.120
"So let me number these in the
order that we're going to",00:38:41.120,00:38:43.670
visit them.,00:38:43.670,00:38:45.876
Like so.,00:38:45.876,00:38:47.070
"And so far, I've just put down
the three fork options that",00:38:47.070,00:38:53.080
"are resident on that
first junction.",00:38:53.080,00:38:57.010
"And I have to take note of
exactly what they do with the",00:38:57.010,00:39:00.650
"lines that come out
of the junction.",00:39:00.650,00:39:03.660
So let's see.,00:39:03.660,00:39:04.160
I'll just copy them down.,00:39:04.160,00:39:05.920
One possibility is this one.,00:39:05.920,00:39:08.760
"Another possibility
is this one.",00:39:08.760,00:39:11.350
"And another possibility
is plus, plus, minus.",00:39:11.350,00:39:17.590
"Oops, I've got plus, plus.",00:39:17.590,00:39:18.840
"No, that's right.",00:39:18.840,00:39:20.020
So that right so far?,00:39:20.020,00:39:21.410
"All I've done is copy
the junction",00:39:21.410,00:39:23.840
labelings from my library.,00:39:23.840,00:39:27.045
"And at this point, Waltz's
algorithm says there's nothing",00:39:27.045,00:39:31.760
"else to do but go on to
junction number two.",00:39:31.760,00:39:34.810
"And unfortunately, sadly, there
are lots of labelings",00:39:34.810,00:39:40.630
"that have to be considered
on junction number 2.",00:39:40.630,00:39:43.260
Six of them.,00:39:43.260,00:39:46.170
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.",00:39:46.170,00:39:49.960
"So one of them looks
like that.",00:39:49.960,00:39:52.090
Another one looks like that.,00:39:52.090,00:39:54.250
"One of them is plus
here, arrow in.",00:39:54.250,00:39:57.180
"Another one is plus
here, arrow out.",00:39:59.840,00:40:06.890
"Another one is minus
here, arrow down.",00:40:06.890,00:40:14.130
"And minus here, arrow up.",00:40:14.130,00:40:16.020
"I think I've copied
those all right.",00:40:16.020,00:40:19.615
"But now, having copied those
down, Waltz's algorithm looks",00:40:19.615,00:40:23.950
"around at the neighboring
junctions and says, are any of",00:40:23.950,00:40:27.760
"the things that I just placed on
junction two disallowed by",00:40:27.760,00:40:32.130
"what I've already placed on
a neighboring junction?",00:40:32.130,00:40:36.250
"So it looks over here
in step number two.",00:40:36.250,00:40:42.100
"And it sees that these three
arrows require the line that",00:40:42.100,00:40:49.050
"joins junctions 1 and 2 to
be either minus or plus.",00:40:49.050,00:40:54.540
"So of the six possibilities, I
can only keep the ones that",00:40:57.480,00:41:01.690
"are likewise content to put
a plus on that line",00:41:01.690,00:41:04.730
that joins the two.,00:41:04.730,00:41:07.160
"So that means that the influence
flowing from",00:41:07.160,00:41:12.760
"junction 1 eliminates that
one, eliminates that one,",00:41:12.760,00:41:19.870
"eliminates that one, and
eliminates that one.",00:41:19.870,00:41:23.590
So half of them are gone.,00:41:23.590,00:41:26.670
"All the ones that try to put a
boundary line on that line",00:41:26.670,00:41:31.540
"between 1 and 2 are
disallowed.",00:41:31.540,00:41:34.335
All right?,00:41:34.335,00:41:36.740
"Now likewise, we could say,
well, of the remaining ones,",00:41:36.740,00:41:39.730
"do they restrict what I
can do at junction 1?",00:41:39.730,00:41:43.550
So let's see.,00:41:43.550,00:41:44.050
Here's a minus.,00:41:44.050,00:41:45.520
And here's a plus.,00:41:45.520,00:41:46.680
"So all these possibilities over
here are still alive.",00:41:46.680,00:41:54.300
"So now, continuing on, we have
to see what we can do at",00:41:54.300,00:41:58.690
junction 3.,00:41:58.690,00:42:00.550
These are arrow labels again.,00:42:00.550,00:42:03.360
"So we have to copy exactly
the same labels",00:42:03.360,00:42:06.030
set as we had before.,00:42:06.030,00:42:07.280
"And now we look down at junction
2 and say, well, what",00:42:13.980,00:42:18.810
"does that tell me about the
three that I've just placed?",00:42:18.810,00:42:22.920
"If we look up from junction
2 to see what kind of",00:42:22.920,00:42:26.820
"constraints it puts on here,
we have this one alive and",00:42:26.820,00:42:31.000
this one alive.,00:42:31.000,00:42:31.710
"I guess we've eliminated
four of the six.",00:42:31.710,00:42:34.040
So we have these two alive.,00:42:34.040,00:42:36.010
"And they both but
boundary lines--",00:42:36.010,00:42:38.990
"I think I must have had this
boundary line wrong, right?",00:42:38.990,00:42:41.920
"No, that's right.",00:42:41.920,00:42:43.170
"Oh yes, I see.",00:42:45.510,00:42:46.760
Plus.,00:42:49.370,00:42:51.130
This one goes--,00:42:51.130,00:42:52.920
hang on a second.,00:42:52.920,00:42:54.655
You let me do something wrong.,00:42:54.655,00:42:56.020
So plus is out.,00:42:58.840,00:43:02.396
"And that must be
one that goes--",00:43:02.396,00:43:03.770
this minus goes up.,00:43:03.770,00:43:06.360
"Oh, yes.",00:43:06.360,00:43:08.040
"I'm too hasty and uncertain
about what I was doing.",00:43:08.040,00:43:11.980
So let's see.,00:43:11.980,00:43:13.570
"This guy has a boundary
going down.",00:43:13.570,00:43:15.660
"And this guy has a boundary
going up.",00:43:15.660,00:43:18.140
"All of the others have
been eliminated.",00:43:18.140,00:43:20.390
"So that means that something
that tries to put a concave",00:43:20.390,00:43:22.780
line there is gone.,00:43:22.780,00:43:24.580
"And something that tries to put
a plus line there is gone.",00:43:24.580,00:43:28.340
"So the influence flowing up in
this direction in the third",00:43:28.340,00:43:32.490
"step eliminates that guy and
eliminates that guy, leaving",00:43:32.490,00:43:36.300
only this guy.,00:43:36.300,00:43:39.460
"But now, the thing I was worried
about is you have to",00:43:39.460,00:43:41.200
"also at this point go down to
2 and see if there's any",00:43:41.200,00:43:44.810
"further constraint on what can
survive down there, based on",00:43:44.810,00:43:50.030
"what has happened over
here at junction 3.",00:43:50.030,00:43:53.440
Now let's see.,00:43:53.440,00:43:55.170
"This one goes up, which is
compatible with a survivor.",00:43:55.170,00:43:58.190
"But this one goes down,
which is not",00:43:58.190,00:43:59.860
compatible with a survivor.,00:43:59.860,00:44:02.020
"So when I bring this down in
step three, this guy is",00:44:02.020,00:44:05.930
eliminated.,00:44:05.930,00:44:07.470
"So now I'm down to just one
interpretation for what can be",00:44:07.470,00:44:12.590
going on at vertex number 2.,00:44:12.590,00:44:15.140
"And one interpretation
for vertex number 3.",00:44:15.140,00:44:20.290
Now let's see.,00:44:20.290,00:44:21.190
This can propagate.,00:44:21.190,00:44:22.360
"So now that I've made a change
on vertex number 2, I have to",00:44:22.360,00:44:25.840
"also see if that causes a change
at vertex number 1.",00:44:25.840,00:44:30.640
So it's propagating through.,00:44:30.640,00:44:32.540
"And now I can see that the only
possibility here is a",00:44:32.540,00:44:36.030
"minus, the label that's coming
down from our survivor.",00:44:36.030,00:44:39.730
So that eliminates these two.,00:44:39.730,00:44:42.730
Whew!,00:44:42.730,00:44:43.620
"It's hard to do this by hand,
but I've got three of the four",00:44:43.620,00:44:46.560
things labeled.,00:44:46.560,00:44:48.530
"And even with just three of the
four labeled, I'm down to",00:44:48.530,00:44:51.940
"a single interpretation for all
of the junctions and the",00:44:51.940,00:44:54.870
lines between them.,00:44:54.870,00:44:57.120
So there's one left.,00:44:57.120,00:44:58.370
"We have to deal with
that fork vertex.",00:45:01.250,00:45:03.080
"We better deal with it, because
for all we know, this",00:45:03.080,00:45:05.240
"is not a legal drawing
in this world.",00:45:05.240,00:45:09.140
"We have five fork vertexes
to place.",00:45:09.140,00:45:15.180
But you know what?,00:45:15.180,00:45:16.370
"I don't have to draw much here,
because I know this is",00:45:16.370,00:45:18.860
forced to be a plus now.,00:45:18.860,00:45:20.640
"And this is forced
to be a plus now.",00:45:20.640,00:45:22.840
"And there's only one fork
vertex with any",00:45:22.840,00:45:24.730
pluses on it at all.,00:45:24.730,00:45:26.940
"So now I can come through and
say, well, the only possible",00:45:26.940,00:45:29.800
survivor is this one.,00:45:29.800,00:45:32.580
These are gone.,00:45:32.580,00:45:34.440
"And now I have an
interpretation",00:45:34.440,00:45:36.540
for all of the junctions.,00:45:36.540,00:45:39.850
"And I see that the winners
are this one.",00:45:39.850,00:45:42.830
And this one.,00:45:42.830,00:45:45.310
And this one.,00:45:45.310,00:45:47.900
And this one.,00:45:47.900,00:45:50.240
"So I've got a unique
interpretation.",00:45:50.240,00:45:52.120
This line is convex.,00:45:52.120,00:45:54.260
This one is concave.,00:45:54.260,00:45:55.620
This is a boundary.,00:45:55.620,00:45:56.830
That's a boundary.,00:45:56.830,00:45:57.560
"And this line is convex,
and that's convex.",00:45:57.560,00:45:59.604
Now that's a lot of work.,00:46:02.770,00:46:04.655
"So I better check and make
sure I got it right.",00:46:04.655,00:46:07.020
"You'd like to see this
demonstrated to make sure I",00:46:07.020,00:46:08.840
haven't made a mistake.,00:46:08.840,00:46:09.840
I'm sure of that.,00:46:09.840,00:46:11.090
Let's see.,00:46:15.440,00:46:18.545
That it?,00:46:18.545,00:46:19.795
"So each of the places where a
line is obscured has four",00:46:24.380,00:46:28.940
"possibilities, labeled E. The
arrow junctions are labeled A.",00:46:28.940,00:46:32.190
"The forks-- there are five of
them-- at the fork junction 5.",00:46:32.190,00:46:35.710
"So let's just step through here
and see what happens.",00:46:35.710,00:46:39.890
Boom.,00:46:39.890,00:46:40.340
I've got it.,00:46:40.340,00:46:42.320
I did do it right.,00:46:42.320,00:46:43.570
So let's try some more.,00:46:49.080,00:46:50.330
"What do you think will
happen with this one?",00:46:54.010,00:46:55.820
Unique solution?,00:46:55.820,00:46:57.070
It stopped.,00:47:03.000,00:47:04.746
Bug in my program?,00:47:04.746,00:47:07.390
Unthinkable.,00:47:07.390,00:47:09.500
What's happened?,00:47:09.500,00:47:11.280
It is genuinely ambiguous.,00:47:11.280,00:47:14.220
"It can be something hanging
down from the ceiling.",00:47:14.220,00:47:17.790
"Or it could be something that
we can think of as a step",00:47:17.790,00:47:22.920
going up from left to right.,00:47:22.920,00:47:26.170
"Let's look at something
more complicated.",00:47:26.170,00:47:27.420
You think it'll work?,00:47:33.910,00:47:36.490
"Not enough constraint for us
to figure that one out.",00:47:36.490,00:47:38.960
"It's equally ambiguous, but a
little bit larger example.",00:47:38.960,00:47:43.530
What about this one?,00:47:43.530,00:47:44.780
"Yeah, but the stuff is creeping
up from the lower",00:47:48.250,00:47:50.130
left up to the upper right.,00:47:50.130,00:47:53.710
"Yeah, bingo.",00:47:53.710,00:47:54.500
It worked.,00:47:54.500,00:47:55.210
It's unambiguous.,00:47:55.210,00:47:56.800
"It's variation on the same
theme we had before.",00:47:56.800,00:47:59.410
"But let me, just for fun, take
these two lines out.",00:47:59.410,00:48:01.980
"What do you think
will happen now?",00:48:05.260,00:48:06.510
"Seems to be doing just fine
until it hits the upper",00:48:09.190,00:48:13.810
right-hand corner and discovers,00:48:13.810,00:48:15.560
it can't label stuff.,00:48:15.560,00:48:17.240
So it propagates back down.,00:48:17.240,00:48:19.530
"And what looked OK in
the lower left is",00:48:19.530,00:48:22.200
no good after all.,00:48:22.200,00:48:23.190
"So these results are kind of
consistent with what we humans",00:48:23.190,00:48:28.510
"do when we look at these
kinds of things.",00:48:28.510,00:48:30.510
"So it's very likely that we,
in our heads, do have some",00:48:30.510,00:48:34.120
"constraint propagation
apparatus",00:48:34.120,00:48:35.740
that we use in vision.,00:48:35.740,00:48:37.590
"But putting that aside, we can
think about other kinds of",00:48:37.590,00:48:40.200
"intelligence different from
human, that might use this",00:48:40.200,00:48:42.940
"kind of mechanism to solve
problems that involve a lot of",00:48:42.940,00:48:46.070
"constraint in finding
a solution.",00:48:46.070,00:48:48.480
"So here, we saw the constraint
propagation activity at work",00:48:48.480,00:48:52.780
on line drawing analysis.,00:48:52.780,00:48:54.380
"But next time, what we're going
do is we're going to see",00:48:54.380,00:48:55.780
at work in map coloring.,00:48:55.780,00:48:56.910
"And who cares about
map coloring?",00:48:56.910,00:48:58.970
"People who do scheduling,
because that turns out to be",00:48:58.970,00:49:01.100
the same problem.,00:49:01.100,00:49:02.350
