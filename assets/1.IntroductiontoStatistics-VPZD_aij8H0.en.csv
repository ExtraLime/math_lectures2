that for some of you,",00:00:56.249,00:00:58.040

throw out a disclaimer.",00:01:01.190,00:01:03.220
I tend to speak too fast.,00:01:03.220,00:01:05.940
I'm aware that.,00:01:05.940,00:01:07.700

do like that when you",00:01:07.700,00:01:10.580

will tell you",00:01:15.979,00:01:17.353

the goals of this class?",00:01:22.760,00:01:26.060
"The first one is basically
to give you an introduction.",00:01:26.060,00:01:28.510
"No one here is expected to
have seen statistics before,",00:01:28.510,00:01:31.910

you are expected",00:01:31.910,00:01:33.470
to have seen probability.,00:01:33.470,00:01:34.770
"And usually, you do
see some statistics",00:01:34.770,00:01:36.830

you have some ideas,",00:01:38.270,00:01:39.990
but I won't expect anything.,00:01:39.990,00:01:42.090
And we'll be using mathematics.,00:01:42.090,00:01:44.120
"Math class, so there's going
to be a bunch of equations--",00:01:44.120,00:01:48.110
"not so much real data
and statistical thinking.",00:01:48.110,00:01:52.532
"We're going to try to provide
theoretical guarantees.",00:01:52.532,00:01:54.740
"We have two estimators
that are available for me--",00:01:54.740,00:01:58.130
"how theory guides me to choose
between the best of them,",00:01:58.130,00:02:01.580
"how certain can I be of my
guarantees or prediction?",00:02:01.580,00:02:06.320
"It's one thing to
just bid out a number.",00:02:06.320,00:02:08.549
"It's another thing to put
some error bars around.",00:02:08.549,00:02:10.590
"And we'll see how to build
error bars, for example.",00:02:10.590,00:02:14.510
"You will have your
own applications.",00:02:14.510,00:02:16.530
"I'm happy to answer questions
about specific applications.",00:02:16.530,00:02:19.160
"But rather than trying
to tailor applications",00:02:19.160,00:02:21.980
"to an entire institute,
I think we're",00:02:21.980,00:02:24.650
"going to work with pretty
standard applications,",00:02:24.650,00:02:28.040
mostly not very serious ones.,00:02:28.040,00:02:32.510
"And hopefully, you'll be able
to take the main principles back",00:02:32.510,00:02:36.470
"with you and apply them to
your particular problem.",00:02:36.470,00:02:39.290
"What I'm hoping that you will
get out of this class is that",00:02:39.290,00:02:43.250
"when you have a real-life
situation-- and by ""real life"",",00:02:43.250,00:02:46.130
"I mean mostly at MIT, so some
people probably would not call",00:02:46.130,00:02:48.890
that real life--,00:02:48.890,00:02:50.240
"their goal is to formulate
a statistical problem",00:02:50.240,00:02:52.370
in mathematical terms.,00:02:52.370,00:02:53.950
"If I want to say,
is a drug effective,",00:02:53.950,00:02:56.930
"that's not in
mathematical terms,",00:02:56.930,00:02:58.620
"I have to find out
which measure I want",00:02:58.620,00:03:00.570
to have to call it effective.,00:03:00.570,00:03:03.470
"Maybe it's over a
certain period of time.",00:03:03.470,00:03:06.780
"So there's a lot of things
that you actually need.",00:03:06.780,00:03:08.990
"And I'm not really
going to tell you",00:03:08.990,00:03:10.489
"how to go from the application
to the point you need to be.",00:03:10.489,00:03:13.461
"But I will certainly
describe to you",00:03:13.461,00:03:14.960
"what point you need to be at
if you want to start applying",00:03:14.960,00:03:19.160
statistical methodology.,00:03:19.160,00:03:21.320
"Then once you understand
what kind of question",00:03:21.320,00:03:23.750
you want to answer--,00:03:23.750,00:03:24.714
"do I want a yes/no answer,
do I want a number,",00:03:24.714,00:03:26.630
"do I want error bars, do
I want to make predictions",00:03:26.630,00:03:29.300
"five years into future, do
I have side information,",00:03:29.300,00:03:32.330
"or do I not have side
information, all those things--",00:03:32.330,00:03:34.784
"based on that,
hopefully, you will",00:03:34.784,00:03:36.200
"have a catalog of
statistical methods",00:03:36.200,00:03:38.480
"that you're going to be able to
use and apply it in the wild.",00:03:38.480,00:03:44.570
"And also, no statistical
method is perfect.",00:03:44.570,00:03:49.370
"Some of the math people have
agreed upon over the years,",00:03:49.370,00:03:52.470
"and people understand
that this is the standard.",00:03:52.470,00:03:54.980
"But I want you to be
able to understand",00:03:54.980,00:03:57.050
"what the limitations are,
and when you make conclusions",00:03:57.050,00:03:59.360
"based on data, that those
conclusions might be erroneous,",00:03:59.360,00:04:03.020
for example.,00:04:03.020,00:04:03.890
"All right, more practically, my
goal here is to have you ready.",00:04:03.890,00:04:09.220
"So who has taken, for example,
a machine-learning class here?",00:04:09.220,00:04:12.916
"All right, so many of you,
actually-- maybe a third",00:04:12.916,00:04:15.820
"have taken a
machine-learning class.",00:04:15.820,00:04:19.230
"So statistics has somewhat
evolved into machine",00:04:19.230,00:04:21.600
learning in recent years.,00:04:21.600,00:04:22.840
"And my goal is to
take you there.",00:04:22.840,00:04:24.529
"So machine learning has a
strong algorithmic component.",00:04:24.529,00:04:26.820
"So maybe some of you have
taken a machine-learning class",00:04:26.820,00:04:29.310
"that displays mostly the
algorithmic component.",00:04:29.310,00:04:31.890
"But there's also a
statistical component.",00:04:31.890,00:04:33.930
The machine learns from data.,00:04:33.930,00:04:37.140
So this is a statistical track.,00:04:37.140,00:04:39.090
"And there are some statistical
machine-learning classes",00:04:39.090,00:04:43.770
that you can take here.,00:04:43.770,00:04:44.800
"They're offered at the
graduate level, I believe.",00:04:44.800,00:04:47.250
"But I want you to be ready to
be able to take those classes,",00:04:47.250,00:04:51.430
"having the statistical
fundamentals to understand",00:04:51.430,00:04:53.520
what you're doing.,00:04:53.520,00:04:54.270
"And then you're going to be able
to expand to broader and more",00:04:54.270,00:04:58.230
sophisticated methods.,00:04:58.230,00:05:00.780
"Lectures are here from 11:00 to
12:30 on Tuesday and Thursday.",00:05:00.780,00:05:05.250
Victor-Emmanuel will also be--,00:05:05.250,00:05:07.270
and you can call him Victor--,00:05:07.270,00:05:09.260
"will also be holding
mandatory recitation.",00:05:09.260,00:05:12.250
"So please go on Stellar
and pick your recitation.",00:05:12.250,00:05:15.030
"It's either 3:00 to 4:00 or
4:00 to 5:00 on Wednesdays.",00:05:15.030,00:05:19.770
"And it's going to be mostly
focused on problem-solving.",00:05:19.770,00:05:22.890
"They're mandatory in the sense
that we're allowed to do this,",00:05:22.890,00:05:28.510
"but they're not going to
cover entirely new material.",00:05:28.510,00:05:32.840
"But they might cover
some techniques",00:05:32.840,00:05:35.760
"that might save you some time
when it comes to the exam.",00:05:35.760,00:05:39.180
So you might get by.,00:05:39.180,00:05:41.460
"Attendance is not going to be
taken or anything like this.",00:05:41.460,00:05:44.250
"But I highly
recommend that you go,",00:05:44.250,00:05:47.760
"because, well,
they're mandatory.",00:05:47.760,00:05:49.420
"So you cannot really complain
that something was taught only",00:05:49.420,00:05:52.830
in recitation.,00:05:52.830,00:05:54.390
"So please register
on Stellar for which",00:05:54.390,00:05:56.760
"of the two recitations
you would like to be in.",00:05:56.760,00:05:59.520
"They're capped at 40, so
first come, first served.",00:05:59.520,00:06:03.230
Homework will be due weekly.,00:06:03.230,00:06:05.600
"There's a total of
11 problem sets.",00:06:05.600,00:06:08.030
I realize this is a lot.,00:06:08.030,00:06:09.090
"Hopefully, we'll
keep them light.",00:06:09.090,00:06:11.090
"I just want you to
not rush too much.",00:06:11.090,00:06:15.350
"The 10 best will
be kept, and this",00:06:15.350,00:06:17.390
"will count for a total of
30% of the final grade.",00:06:17.390,00:06:20.640
"There are due Mondays
at 8:00 PM on Stellar.",00:06:20.640,00:06:25.280
And this is a new thing.,00:06:25.280,00:06:28.670
"We're not going to use the boxes
outside of the math department.",00:06:28.670,00:06:31.590
"We're going to use
only PDF files.",00:06:31.590,00:06:34.520
"Well, you're always welcome
to type them and practice",00:06:34.520,00:06:37.790
your LaTeX or Word typing.,00:06:37.790,00:06:40.430
"I also understand that this
can be a bit of a strain,",00:06:40.430,00:06:42.830
"so just write them down
on a piece of paper,",00:06:42.830,00:06:45.800
"use your iPhone, and
take a picture of it.",00:06:45.800,00:06:48.800
"Dropbox has a nice, new--",00:06:48.800,00:06:50.810
"so try to find something
that puts a lot of contrast,",00:06:50.810,00:06:53.149
"especially if you use
pencil, because we're going",00:06:53.149,00:06:55.190
to check if they're readable.,00:06:55.190,00:06:56.840
"And this is your responsibility
to have a readable file.",00:06:56.840,00:07:01.160
I've had over the years--,00:07:01.160,00:07:02.450
"not at MIT, I must
admit-- but I've",00:07:02.450,00:07:03.920
"had students who actually
write the doc file",00:07:03.920,00:07:06.170
"and think that
converting it to a PDF",00:07:06.170,00:07:08.180
"consists in erasing
the extension doc",00:07:08.180,00:07:11.360
and replacing it by PDF.,00:07:11.360,00:07:12.680
This is not how it works.,00:07:12.680,00:07:13.850
"So I'm sure you
will figure it out.",00:07:17.450,00:07:19.790
"Please try to keep
them letter-sized.",00:07:19.790,00:07:21.620
"This is not a
strict requirement,",00:07:21.620,00:07:23.480
"but I don't want to
see thumbnails, either.",00:07:23.480,00:07:26.330
"You are allowed to have
two late homeworks.",00:07:26.330,00:07:28.370
"And by late, I
mean 24 hours late.",00:07:28.370,00:07:31.430
No questions asked.,00:07:31.430,00:07:32.510
"You submit them,
this will be counted.",00:07:32.510,00:07:34.630
"You don't have to send
an email to warn us",00:07:34.630,00:07:36.380
or anything like this.,00:07:36.380,00:07:39.350
"Beyond that, even that
you have one slack",00:07:39.350,00:07:42.500
"for one 0 grade and slack
for two late homeworks,",00:07:42.500,00:07:46.490
"you're going to have to come
up with a very good explanation",00:07:46.490,00:07:49.820
"why you need actually more
extensions than that, if you",00:07:49.820,00:07:52.310
ever do.,00:07:52.310,00:07:53.060
"And particularly,
you're going to have",00:07:53.060,00:07:54.643
"to keep track about why you've
used your three options before.",00:07:54.643,00:07:58.220
"There's going to
be two midterms.",00:07:58.220,00:08:00.830
"One is October 3, and
one is November 7.",00:08:00.830,00:08:03.740

in class for the duration",00:08:03.740,00:08:05.840
of the lecture.,00:08:05.840,00:08:06.860
"When I say they last for
an hour and 20 minutes,",00:08:06.860,00:08:09.370
"it does not mean that
if you arrive 10 minutes",00:08:09.370,00:08:11.390
"before the end of
lecture, you still",00:08:11.390,00:08:12.889
get an hour and 20 minutes.,00:08:12.889,00:08:14.210
"It will end at the
end of lecture time.",00:08:14.210,00:08:17.780
"For this as well, no pressure.",00:08:17.780,00:08:19.580
"Only the best of the
two will be kept.",00:08:19.580,00:08:22.010
"And this grade will count
for 30% of the grade.",00:08:22.010,00:08:26.120
"This will be closed-books
and closed-notes.",00:08:26.120,00:08:29.120

did you say there are?",00:08:30.941,00:08:33.108

"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: We will add
them, multiply the number by 9,",00:08:50.757,00:08:53.340

just a limit to what I can do.",00:08:55.410,00:08:59.670

to have your notes with you.,00:09:05.700,00:09:07.170
"But the midterms are
also a way for you",00:09:07.170,00:09:09.300
"to develop some mechanism so
that you don't actually waste",00:09:09.300,00:09:11.760
"too much time on things that
you should be able to do",00:09:11.760,00:09:14.160
without thinking too much.,00:09:14.160,00:09:16.092
"You will be allowed
to cheat sheet,",00:09:16.092,00:09:17.550
"because, well, you can
always forget something.",00:09:17.550,00:09:20.940
"And it will be
two-sided letters sheet,",00:09:20.940,00:09:23.790
"and you can practice yourself
as writing as small as you want.",00:09:23.790,00:09:27.790
"And you can put whatever you
want on this cheat sheet.",00:09:27.790,00:09:30.510
"All right, the final will
be decided by the register.",00:09:30.510,00:09:33.037
"It's going to be
three hours, and it's",00:09:33.037,00:09:34.620
going to count for 40%.,00:09:34.620,00:09:35.832
"You cannot bring books, but
you can bring your notes.",00:09:35.832,00:09:38.040
Yes.,00:09:38.040,00:09:38.556
"AUDIENCE: I noticed
that the midterm dates",00:09:38.556,00:09:40.306
aren't dated in the syllabus.,00:09:40.306,00:09:41.704
"So I wanted to
make sure you know.",00:09:41.704,00:09:43.120
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: They are not?,00:09:43.120,00:09:44.453
AUDIENCE: Yeah--,00:09:44.453,00:09:45.470
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Oh, yeah, there's",00:09:45.470,00:09:45.890
"a ""1"" that's missing on
both of them, isn't there?",00:09:45.890,00:09:47.973
"Yeah, let's figure that out.",00:09:59.030,00:10:03.180
The syllabus is the true one.,00:10:03.180,00:10:05.510
"The slides are so
that we can discuss,",00:10:05.510,00:10:07.422
"but the ones that's
on the syllabus",00:10:07.422,00:10:08.880
are the ones that count.,00:10:08.880,00:10:09.879
"And I think they're also posted
on the calendar on Stellar",00:10:09.879,00:10:13.050
as well.,00:10:13.050,00:10:14.909
Any other question?,00:10:14.909,00:10:15.700
"OK, so the pre-reqs here--",00:10:20.890,00:10:23.380
"and who has looked at the
first problem set already?",00:10:23.380,00:10:28.100
"OK, so those hands
that are raised",00:10:28.100,00:10:30.940
"realize that there is a true
prerequisite of probability",00:10:30.940,00:10:34.160
for this class.,00:10:34.160,00:10:36.300
"It can be at the level
of 18.600 or 604.1.",00:10:36.300,00:10:40.840
"I should say ""B"" now.",00:10:40.840,00:10:42.060
It's two classes.,00:10:42.060,00:10:44.780
"I will require you
to know some calculus",00:10:44.780,00:10:48.230
"and have some notions
of linear algebra,",00:10:48.230,00:10:51.170
"such as, what is a matrix,
what is a vector, how",00:10:51.170,00:10:53.510
"do you multiply those
things together,",00:10:53.510,00:10:55.730
"some notion of what
orthonormal vectors are.",00:10:55.730,00:10:58.400
"We'll talk about
eigenvectors and eigenvalues,",00:11:01.280,00:11:03.350
but I remind you all of that.,00:11:03.350,00:11:05.010
"So this is not this
strict pre-req.",00:11:05.010,00:11:07.550
"But if you've taken
it, for example,",00:11:07.550,00:11:09.910
"it doesn't hurt to
go back to your notes",00:11:09.910,00:11:12.080
"when we get closer
to this chapter",00:11:12.080,00:11:13.940
on principle-component analysis.,00:11:13.940,00:11:15.950
"The chapters, as they're listed
in the syllabus, are in order,",00:11:15.950,00:11:19.520
"so you will see when
it actually comes.",00:11:19.520,00:11:22.430
There's no required textbook.,00:11:22.430,00:11:24.830
"And I know you tend
to not like that.",00:11:24.830,00:11:29.506
"You like to have your textbook
to know where you're going",00:11:29.506,00:11:31.880
and what we're doing.,00:11:31.880,00:11:32.810
"I'm sorry, it's just this class.",00:11:32.810,00:11:34.670
"Either I would have to go
to a mathematical statistics",00:11:34.670,00:11:36.950
"textbook, which
is just too much,",00:11:36.950,00:11:38.970
"or to go to a more
engineering-type statistics",00:11:38.970,00:11:43.010
"class, which is just too little.",00:11:43.010,00:11:45.380
"So hopefully, the
problems will be enough",00:11:45.380,00:11:49.160
"for you to practice
the recitations.",00:11:49.160,00:11:50.690
"We'll have some problems
to solve as well.",00:11:50.690,00:11:52.940
"And the material will
be posted on the slides.",00:11:52.940,00:11:55.520
"So you should have
everything you need.",00:11:55.520,00:11:57.320
"There's plenty of
resources online",00:11:57.320,00:11:58.799
"if you want to expand
on a particular topic",00:11:58.799,00:12:00.590
"or read it as said
by somebody else.",00:12:00.590,00:12:03.080
"The book that I
recommend in the syllabus",00:12:03.080,00:12:07.690
"is this book called All of
Statistics by Wasserman.",00:12:07.690,00:12:11.510
"Mainly because of the
title, I'm guessing",00:12:11.510,00:12:13.580
it has all of it in it.,00:12:13.580,00:12:16.700
It's pretty broad.,00:12:16.700,00:12:18.530
There's actually not that many.,00:12:18.530,00:12:20.030
"It's more of an
intro-grad level.",00:12:20.030,00:12:22.910
"But it's not very deep, but
you see a lot of the overview.",00:12:22.910,00:12:27.890
"Certainly, what
we're going to cover",00:12:27.890,00:12:29.480
"will be a subset
of what's in there.",00:12:29.480,00:12:30.979
"The slides will be
posted on Stellar",00:12:34.190,00:12:35.690
"before lectures before
we start a new chapter",00:12:35.690,00:12:38.420
"and after we're done with the
chapter, with the annotations,",00:12:38.420,00:12:41.960
"and also, with the typos
corrected, like for the exam.",00:12:41.960,00:12:46.784
"There will be some
video lectures.",00:12:46.784,00:12:48.200
"Again, the first one will be
posted on OCW from last year.",00:12:48.200,00:12:52.550
"But all of them will be
available on Stellar--",00:12:52.550,00:12:54.950
"of course, module
technical problems.",00:12:54.950,00:12:57.770
But this is an automated system.,00:12:57.770,00:13:00.317
"And hopefully, it will
work out well for us.",00:13:00.317,00:13:02.150
"So if you somehow have
to miss a lecture,",00:13:02.150,00:13:04.490
"you can always catch
it up by watching it.",00:13:04.490,00:13:08.270
"You can also play
at that speed 0.75",00:13:08.270,00:13:10.760
"in case I end up
speaking too fast,",00:13:10.760,00:13:12.530
"but I think I've
managed myself so far--",00:13:12.530,00:13:15.470
so just last warning.,00:13:15.470,00:13:19.690
"All right, why should
you study statistics?",00:13:19.690,00:13:22.910
"Well, if you read the news, you
will see a lot of statistics.",00:13:22.910,00:13:27.362
I mentioned machine learning.,00:13:27.362,00:13:28.570
"It's built on a
lot of statistics.",00:13:28.570,00:13:32.269
"If I were to teach this
class 10 years ago,",00:13:32.269,00:13:34.060
"I would have to explain to you
that data collection and making",00:13:34.060,00:13:37.480
"decisions based on data was
something that made sense.",00:13:37.480,00:13:40.510
"But now, it's
almost in our life.",00:13:40.510,00:13:43.180
"We're used to this idea that
data helps in making decisions.",00:13:43.180,00:13:47.470
"And people use data
to conduct studies.",00:13:47.470,00:13:51.680
"So here, I found a bunch
of press titles that--",00:13:51.680,00:13:55.344
"I think the key word I was
looking for was ""study finds""--",00:13:55.344,00:13:57.760
if I want to do this.,00:13:57.760,00:13:58.635
"So I actually did not bother
doing it again this year.",00:13:58.635,00:14:01.640
"This is all 2016, 2016, 2016.",00:14:01.640,00:14:04.540
"But the key word that I look
for is usually ""study find""--",00:14:04.540,00:14:07.030
so a new study find--,00:14:07.030,00:14:08.350
traffic is bad for your health.,00:14:08.350,00:14:10.710
"So we had to wait for 2016
for data to tell us that.",00:14:10.710,00:14:13.740
"And there's a bunch of other
slightly more interesting ones.",00:14:13.740,00:14:18.490
"For example, one that you
might find interesting",00:14:18.490,00:14:20.530
"is that this study finds that
students benefit from waiting",00:14:20.530,00:14:24.280
to declare a major.,00:14:24.280,00:14:26.000
"Now, there's a bunch
of press titles.",00:14:26.000,00:14:28.300
"There one in the MIT News
that finds brain connections,",00:14:28.300,00:14:33.385
key to reading.,00:14:33.385,00:14:34.870
"And so here, we have an
idea of what happened there.",00:14:34.870,00:14:37.750
Some data was collected.,00:14:37.750,00:14:39.490
"Some scientific
hypothesis was formulated.",00:14:39.490,00:14:42.580
"And then the data was here
to try to prove or disprove",00:14:42.580,00:14:47.920
this scientific hypothesis.,00:14:47.920,00:14:49.360
"That's the usual
scientific process.",00:14:49.360,00:14:51.600
"And we need to understand how
the scientific process goes,",00:14:51.600,00:14:55.300
"because some of those things
might be actually questionable.",00:14:55.300,00:14:58.030
"Who is 100% sure that
study finds that students--",00:14:58.030,00:15:02.140
"do you think that you
benefit from waiting",00:15:02.140,00:15:04.600
to declare a major?,00:15:04.600,00:15:05.710
"Right I would be
skeptical about this.",00:15:05.710,00:15:09.370
"I would be like, I don't want
to wait to declare a major.",00:15:09.370,00:15:13.360
"So what kind of
thing can we bring?",00:15:13.360,00:15:15.130
"Well maybe this
study studied people",00:15:15.130,00:15:17.170
that were different from me.,00:15:17.170,00:15:18.370
"Or maybe the study
finds that this",00:15:18.370,00:15:21.126
"is beneficial for a
majority of people.",00:15:21.126,00:15:22.750
I'm not a majority.,00:15:22.750,00:15:23.890
I'm just one person.,00:15:23.890,00:15:24.724
"There's a bunch
of things that we",00:15:24.724,00:15:26.098
"need to understand what
those things actually mean.",00:15:26.098,00:15:28.540
"And we'll see that
those are actually not",00:15:28.540,00:15:30.248
statements about individuals.,00:15:30.248,00:15:31.511
"They're not even statements
about the cohort of people",00:15:31.511,00:15:33.760
they've actually looked at.,00:15:33.760,00:15:35.050
"They're statements
about a parameter",00:15:35.050,00:15:37.270
"of a distribution
that was used to model",00:15:37.270,00:15:40.860
the benefit of waiting.,00:15:40.860,00:15:43.720
So there's a lot of questions.,00:15:43.720,00:15:45.040
"And there are a lot of
layers that come into this.",00:15:45.040,00:15:46.840
"And we're going to want to
understand what was going on",00:15:46.840,00:15:49.131
"in there and try to peel it off
and understand what assumptions",00:15:49.131,00:15:52.992
have been put in there.,00:15:52.992,00:15:53.950
"Even though it looks like
a totally legit study, out",00:15:53.950,00:15:59.650
"of those studies,
statistically, I",00:15:59.650,00:16:01.759
"think there's going to be
one that's going to be wrong.",00:16:01.759,00:16:04.050
"Well, maybe not one.",00:16:04.050,00:16:05.140
"But if I put a
long list of those,",00:16:05.140,00:16:07.930
"there would be a few that
would actually be wrong.",00:16:07.930,00:16:10.150
"If I put 20, there would
definitely be one that's wrong.",00:16:10.150,00:16:12.840
So you have to see that.,00:16:12.840,00:16:13.840
"Every time you see 20 studies,
one is probably wrong.",00:16:13.840,00:16:16.600
"When there are studies
about drug effects,",00:16:16.600,00:16:19.000
"out of a list of 100,
one would be wrong.",00:16:19.000,00:16:21.260
"So we'll see what that means
and what I mean by that.",00:16:21.260,00:16:23.590
"Of course, not only studies
that make discoveries",00:16:26.840,00:16:30.980
"are actually making
the press titles.",00:16:30.980,00:16:32.930
"There's also the press
that talks about things",00:16:32.930,00:16:36.890
that make no sense.,00:16:36.890,00:16:38.480
"I love this first experiment--
the salmon experiment.",00:16:38.480,00:16:41.600
"Actually, it was
a grad student who",00:16:41.600,00:16:44.240
"came to a neuroscience
poster session,",00:16:44.240,00:16:47.720
"pulled out this
poster, and explained",00:16:47.720,00:16:50.780
"the scientific experiment
that he was conducting,",00:16:50.780,00:16:53.210
"which consisted in taking a
previously frozen and thawed",00:16:53.210,00:16:59.510
"salmon, putting it
in an MRI, showing it",00:16:59.510,00:17:02.060
"pictures of violent images, and
recording its brain activity.",00:17:02.060,00:17:07.760
"And he was able to discover a
few voxels that were activated",00:17:07.760,00:17:11.780
by those violent images.,00:17:11.780,00:17:14.180
"And can somebody tell
me what happened here?",00:17:14.180,00:17:16.339
"Was the salmon responding
to the violent activity?",00:17:19.200,00:17:23.530
"Basically, this is just
a statistical fluke.",00:17:23.530,00:17:26.020
That's just randomness at play.,00:17:26.020,00:17:27.730
"There's so many voxels
that are recorded,",00:17:27.730,00:17:29.936
"and there's so
many fluctuations.",00:17:29.936,00:17:31.310
"There's always a
little bit of noise",00:17:31.310,00:17:32.630
"when you're in those
things, that some of them,",00:17:32.630,00:17:34.588
"just by chance, got lit up.",00:17:34.588,00:17:36.472
"And so we need to understand
how to correct for that.",00:17:36.472,00:17:38.680
"In this particular
instance, we need",00:17:38.680,00:17:40.210
"to have tools that tell us that,
well, finding three voxels that",00:17:40.210,00:17:43.600
"are activated for
that many voxels",00:17:43.600,00:17:47.020
"that you can find in
the salmon's brain",00:17:47.020,00:17:50.200
is just too small of a number.,00:17:50.200,00:17:53.030
"Maybe we need to find a clump
of 20 of them, for example.",00:17:53.030,00:17:56.050
"All right, so
we're going to have",00:17:56.050,00:17:57.670
"mathematical tools that help us
find those particular numbers.",00:17:57.670,00:18:02.710
"I don't know if you ever
saw this one by John Oliver",00:18:02.710,00:18:07.780
about phacking.,00:18:07.780,00:18:11.230
"Or actually, it said p-hacking.",00:18:11.230,00:18:14.110
"Basically, what John
Oliver is saying",00:18:14.110,00:18:17.710
"is actually a full-length-- like
there's long segments on this.",00:18:17.710,00:18:20.410
"And he was explaining how
there's a sociology question",00:18:20.410,00:18:24.220

huge incentive for scientists",00:18:24.220,00:18:28.930

it's as if they",00:18:35.277,00:18:36.860

was just lit up by chance.",00:18:39.070,00:18:41.920

under water, under sea level.",00:20:03.070,00:20:06.410

to build a dike,",00:20:08.237,00:20:09.820

what did they do?",00:20:28.510,00:20:30.400
"Well, they collected
data for previous floods.",00:20:30.400,00:20:33.700

found a dike that",00:20:33.700,00:20:36.220
"was going to cover
all these things.",00:20:36.220,00:20:37.720
"Now, if you look at the
data they probably had,",00:20:37.720,00:20:40.060
maybe it was scarce.,00:20:40.060,00:20:41.590
Maybe they had 10 data points.,00:20:41.590,00:20:43.484

data points, then",00:20:43.484,00:20:44.900

statistics is probably",00:21:39.220,00:21:42.910

kind of drug it is,",00:22:21.507,00:22:23.090

not a mathematical equation.",00:22:56.480,00:22:59.630

question And that's",00:23:02.420,00:23:04.411
"essentially we're
going to be doing.",00:23:04.411,00:23:05.910

are using that.",00:23:12.460,00:23:15.040

the same size of data",00:23:15.040,00:23:19.120
"that you would
see for FMRI data.",00:23:19.120,00:23:21.100

a study that I found.",00:23:21.100,00:23:25.480

just to make sure",00:23:32.700,00:23:34.480

"It's targeted to
very specific genes.",00:23:50.228,00:23:52.570

knock it down, or knock it",00:23:52.570,00:23:55.554
"up, or boost it, maybe
we could actually",00:23:55.554,00:23:57.220
have an impact on that.,00:23:57.220,00:23:58.178

important questions,",00:23:58.178,00:24:00.111
"because we have the technology
to target those things.",00:24:00.111,00:24:02.360

about what those things are.",00:24:02.360,00:24:04.630

of other questions.",00:24:04.630,00:24:07.557

talk to biologists about say,",00:24:07.557,00:24:09.890
I can do that.,00:24:09.890,00:24:10.300

very different questions.",00:24:15.046,00:24:17.084

all these questions,",00:24:17.084,00:24:19.000

you're reusing your data again.",00:24:19.000,00:24:22.040

the place, those things.",00:24:26.920,00:24:29.530

the way to John Oliver talking",00:24:29.530,00:24:32.170

those examples?",00:24:33.567,00:24:35.025

going to just take",00:24:38.900,00:24:40.358
"this data set of those cases

all these examples?",00:24:46.350,00:24:49.370

to use statistics",00:24:49.370,00:24:50.960

randomness of the data.",00:24:53.120,00:24:55.650

we just don't understand--",00:24:55.650,00:24:59.300
"for example, the randomness
associated with the lining up",00:24:59.300,00:25:02.750
of some voxels.,00:25:02.750,00:25:04.010

far as the insurance",00:25:04.010,00:25:06.650
"is concerned whether you're
going to break your iPhone",00:25:06.650,00:25:09.050

a coin toss.",00:25:09.050,00:25:10.790

of the statistician,",00:25:14.780,00:25:16.770

actually random events.",00:25:16.770,00:25:18.590

this randomness,",00:25:18.590,00:25:20.550

a little randomness?",00:25:23.722,00:25:25.430

something that's",00:25:25.430,00:25:26.846

"let's see, for example,
for the floods.",00:25:32.990,00:25:35.040

saw consistently almost",00:25:35.040,00:25:38.000
the same size?,00:25:38.000,00:25:40.790
"It was almost a rounding
error, or they're just",00:25:40.790,00:25:43.310
really widespread.,00:25:43.310,00:25:44.366
"All these things, we
need to understand",00:25:44.366,00:25:45.990

how to build those dikes",00:25:45.990,00:25:48.320

this randomness.",00:25:54.390,00:25:58.130

questions to randomness",00:25:58.130,00:26:01.550
"were actually
hidden in the text.",00:26:01.550,00:26:03.110

the notion of average.",00:26:03.110,00:26:05.680

insurance is concerned,",00:26:05.680,00:26:08.672

actually breaking your iPhone?",00:26:10.880,00:26:13.970

this notion of fair premium.",00:26:13.970,00:26:18.330

of quantifying chance.",00:26:18.330,00:26:21.472

maybe only about average,",00:26:21.472,00:26:23.430
"maybe you want to cover say
99% percent of the floods.",00:26:23.430,00:26:26.280

the height of a flood that's",00:26:26.280,00:26:31.920
higher than 99% of the floods.,00:26:31.920,00:26:34.350

doomsday comes.",00:26:36.960,00:26:38.790

most of the floods.",00:26:40.470,00:26:43.187

of significance, right?",00:26:43.187,00:26:45.270

example, a second ago",00:26:45.270,00:26:47.880

people than it did not.",00:26:51.180,00:26:55.350

it's significantly good,",00:26:55.350,00:26:58.020

people just recovered.",00:26:59.220,00:27:01.950

curing a common cold.",00:27:01.950,00:27:04.710

oh I got cured.",00:27:04.710,00:27:06.840

days and then you got cured.",00:27:06.840,00:27:09.540

are actually notions",00:27:12.780,00:27:15.150
"that describe randomness
and quantify randomness",00:27:15.150,00:27:18.270
into simple things.,00:27:18.270,00:27:19.560
"Randomness is a very
complicated beast.",00:27:19.560,00:27:21.630
"But we can summarize it into
things that we understand.",00:27:21.630,00:27:24.390
"Just like I am a
complicated object.",00:27:24.390,00:27:27.630
"I'm made of molecules,
and made of genes,",00:27:27.630,00:27:29.610
"and made of very
complicated things.",00:27:29.610,00:27:31.290
"But I can be summarized as
my name, my email address,",00:27:31.290,00:27:34.890
"my height and my weight,
and maybe for most of you,",00:27:34.890,00:27:37.270
this is basically enough.,00:27:37.270,00:27:39.100
"You will recognize
me without having",00:27:39.100,00:27:41.220
"to do a biopsy on me
every time you see me.",00:27:41.220,00:27:45.240
"All right, so, to
understand randomness",00:27:45.240,00:27:49.020
"you have to go
through probability.",00:27:49.020,00:27:51.450
"Probability is the
study of randomness.",00:27:51.450,00:27:53.370
That's what it is.,00:27:53.370,00:27:54.130
"That's what the first sentence
that a lecturer in probability",00:27:54.130,00:27:57.750
will say.,00:27:57.750,00:27:58.890
"And so that's why I need the
pre-requisite, because this",00:27:58.890,00:28:02.040
"is what we're going to use
to describe the randomness.",00:28:02.040,00:28:04.830
"We'll see in a second how it
interacts with statistics.",00:28:04.830,00:28:07.830
"So sometimes, and actually
probably most of the time",00:28:07.830,00:28:10.590
"throughout your
semester on probability,",00:28:10.590,00:28:13.460
"randomness was very
well understood.",00:28:13.460,00:28:15.810
"When you saw a
probability problem, here",00:28:15.810,00:28:18.420
"was the chance of
this happening,",00:28:18.420,00:28:19.860
"here was the chance
of that happening.",00:28:19.860,00:28:21.720
"Maybe you had more
complicated questions",00:28:21.720,00:28:23.820
"that you had some basic
elements to answer.",00:28:23.820,00:28:26.720
"For example, the probability
that I have HBO is this much.",00:28:26.720,00:28:32.127
"And the probability that I watch
Game of Thrones is that much.",00:28:32.127,00:28:34.710
"And given that I play basketball
what is the probability--",00:28:34.710,00:28:38.160
"you had all these
crazy questions,",00:28:38.160,00:28:39.870
but you were able to build them.,00:28:39.870,00:28:42.360
"But all the basic numbers
were given to you.",00:28:42.360,00:28:45.340
"Statistics will be about
finding those basic numbers.",00:28:45.340,00:28:48.240
"All right so some examples
that you've probably seen",00:28:48.240,00:28:51.940
"were dice, cards,
roulette, flipping coins.",00:28:51.940,00:28:55.950
"All of these things
are things that you've",00:28:55.950,00:28:57.700
seen in a probability class.,00:28:57.700,00:28:59.060
"And the reason is
because it's very easy",00:28:59.060,00:29:00.726
"to describe the probability
of each outcome.",00:29:00.726,00:29:02.680
"For a die we know that
each face is going",00:29:02.680,00:29:05.620
to come with probably 1/6.,00:29:05.620,00:29:07.150
"Now I'm not going to go into
a debate of whether this",00:29:07.150,00:29:09.910
"is pure randomness or
this is determinism.",00:29:09.910,00:29:12.160
"I think as a model
for actual randomness",00:29:12.160,00:29:14.940
"a die is a pretty good
number, flipping a coin",00:29:14.940,00:29:18.220
is a pretty good model.,00:29:18.220,00:29:20.170
"So those are actually
a good thing.",00:29:20.170,00:29:22.600
"So the questions that you
would see, for example,",00:29:22.600,00:29:24.650
"in probabilities
are the following.",00:29:24.650,00:29:26.320
I roll one die.,00:29:26.320,00:29:27.640
"Alice gets $1 if the number
of dots is less than three.",00:29:27.640,00:29:31.300
"Bob gets $2 if the number
of dots is less than two.",00:29:31.300,00:29:35.230
"Do you want to be Alice or
Bob given that your role is",00:29:35.230,00:29:37.510
actually to make money.,00:29:37.510,00:29:40.965
"Yeah, you want to be Bob, right?",00:29:40.965,00:29:43.910
So let's see why.,00:29:43.910,00:29:45.410
"So if you look at the
expectation of what",00:29:45.410,00:29:47.300
Alice makes.,00:29:47.300,00:29:48.500
So let's call it a.,00:29:48.500,00:29:51.140
"This is $1, with
probability 1/2.",00:29:51.140,00:29:56.080
"So 3/6, that's 1/2.",00:29:56.080,00:29:59.630
"And the expectation
of what Bob makes,",00:29:59.630,00:30:02.820
"this is $2 with probably
2/6 and that's 2/3.",00:30:02.820,00:30:11.370
"Which is definitely
larger than 1/2.",00:30:11.370,00:30:13.230
"So Bob's expectations
actually a bit higher.",00:30:13.230,00:30:17.109
"So those are the kind
of questions that you",00:30:17.109,00:30:18.900
may ask with probability.,00:30:18.900,00:30:19.941
"I described to you
exactly, you use the fact",00:30:19.941,00:30:21.930
"that the die would get
less than three dots,",00:30:21.930,00:30:25.337
with probability one half.,00:30:25.337,00:30:26.420
We knew that.,00:30:26.420,00:30:27.090
"And I didn't have to describe
to you what was going on there.",00:30:27.090,00:30:29.880
"You didn't have to
collect data about a die.",00:30:29.880,00:30:32.460
"Same thing, you roll two dice.",00:30:32.460,00:30:34.620
"You choose a number
between 2 and 12",00:30:34.620,00:30:36.180
"and you win $100 if you choose
the sum of the two dice.",00:30:36.180,00:30:42.100
Which number do you pick?,00:30:42.100,00:30:45.052
What?,00:30:45.052,00:30:46.812
AUDIENCE: 7.,00:30:46.812,00:30:47.312
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: 7.,00:30:47.312,00:30:48.186
Why 7?,00:30:48.186,00:30:48.800
AUDIENCE: It's the most likely.,00:30:48.800,00:30:50.430
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: That's
the most likely one, right?",00:30:50.430,00:30:52.638
"So your gain here will be
$100 times the probability",00:30:52.638,00:30:56.800
"that the sum of the two
dice, let's say x plus y,",00:30:56.800,00:31:00.220
"is equal to your little
z where a little z is",00:31:00.220,00:31:03.430
the number you pick.,00:31:03.430,00:31:04.478
"So 7 is the most
likely to happen",00:31:07.830,00:31:10.350
"and that's the one that
maximizes this function of z.",00:31:10.350,00:31:14.580
"And for this you need to study
a more complicated function.",00:31:14.580,00:31:17.112
"But it's a function
that enables two die.",00:31:17.112,00:31:18.820
"But you can compute the
probability that x plus y",00:31:18.820,00:31:21.720
"is equal to z, for every
z between 2 and 12.",00:31:21.720,00:31:26.490
"So you know exactly what
the probabilities are",00:31:26.490,00:31:29.010
"and that's how you
start probability.",00:31:29.010,00:31:30.930
"So here that's
exactly what I said.",00:31:35.450,00:31:38.660
"You have a very simple process
that describes basic events.",00:31:38.660,00:31:43.550
"Probability 1/6
for each of them.",00:31:43.550,00:31:45.074
"And then you can
build up on that,",00:31:45.074,00:31:46.490
"and understand probably of
more complicated events.",00:31:46.490,00:31:49.120
"You can throw some
money in there.",00:31:49.120,00:31:50.750
You can be build functions.,00:31:50.750,00:31:52.780
"You can do very complicated
things building on that.",00:31:52.780,00:31:56.960
"Now if I was a
statistician, a statistician",00:31:56.960,00:31:59.780
"would be the guy who
just arrived on earth,",00:31:59.780,00:32:01.640
"had never seen a die
and needs to understand",00:32:01.640,00:32:03.473
"that a die come up with
probably 1/6 on each side.",00:32:03.473,00:32:05.840
"And the way he would do
it is just to roll the die",00:32:05.840,00:32:08.030
"until he get some counts
and tries to estimate those.",00:32:08.030,00:32:12.440
"And maybe that guy
would come and say,",00:32:12.440,00:32:14.060
"well, you know,
actually, the probability",00:32:14.060,00:32:16.440
"that I get a 1 is 1/6 plus
0.001 and the probability",00:32:16.440,00:32:23.500
"that I get a 2 is
1/6 minus 0.005.",00:32:23.500,00:32:27.650
"And there would be some
fluctuations around this.",00:32:27.650,00:32:29.910
"And it's going to be his
role as a statistician",00:32:29.910,00:32:31.868
"to say, listen, this
is too complicated",00:32:31.868,00:32:33.500
of a model for this thing.,00:32:33.500,00:32:34.880
"And these should all
be the same numbers.",00:32:34.880,00:32:36.694
"Just looking at data, they
should be all the same numbers.",00:32:36.694,00:32:39.110
And that's part of the modeling.,00:32:39.110,00:32:40.150
"You make some
simplifying assumptions",00:32:40.150,00:32:41.930
"that essentially make your
questions more accurate.",00:32:41.930,00:32:46.590
"Now, of course, if
your model is wrong,",00:32:46.590,00:32:48.230
"if it's not true that
all the faces arrive",00:32:48.230,00:32:50.120
"with the same probability, then
you have a model error here.",00:32:50.120,00:32:54.410
"So we will be
making model errors.",00:32:54.410,00:32:56.146
"But that's going to
be the price to pay",00:32:56.146,00:32:57.770
"to be able to extract
anything from our data.",00:32:57.770,00:32:59.645
"So for more
complicated processes,",00:33:02.860,00:33:07.299
"so of course nobody's going to
waste their time rolling dice.",00:33:07.299,00:33:09.840
"I mean, I'm sure
you might have done",00:33:09.840,00:33:11.370
this in AP stat or something.,00:33:11.370,00:33:13.860
"But the need is to estimate
parameters from data.",00:33:13.860,00:33:18.070
"All right, so for more
complicated things",00:33:18.070,00:33:19.830
"you might want to estimate
some density parameter",00:33:19.830,00:33:27.350
on a particular set of material.,00:33:27.350,00:33:29.400
"And for this maybe you need
to beam something to it,",00:33:29.400,00:33:31.620
"and measure how fast
it's coming back.",00:33:31.620,00:33:33.449
"And you're going to have
some measurement errors.",00:33:33.449,00:33:35.490
"And maybe you need to
do that several times",00:33:35.490,00:33:37.281
"and you have a model for
the physical process that's",00:33:37.281,00:33:39.750
actually going on.,00:33:39.750,00:33:40.960
"And physics is usually
a very good way",00:33:40.960,00:33:42.750
"to get models for
engineering perspective.",00:33:42.750,00:33:46.560
"But there's models
for sociology where we",00:33:46.560,00:33:49.320
"have no physical system, right.",00:33:49.320,00:33:52.260
God knows how people interact.,00:33:52.260,00:33:53.670
"And maybe I'm going
to say that the way",00:33:53.670,00:33:55.650
"I make friends is by first
flipping a coin in my pocket.",00:33:55.650,00:33:59.870
"And with probability
2/3, I'm going",00:33:59.870,00:34:01.560
to make my friend at work.,00:34:01.560,00:34:02.730
"And with probability
1/3 I'm going",00:34:02.730,00:34:04.410
to make my friend at soccer.,00:34:04.410,00:34:05.850
"And once I make my
friends at soccer--",00:34:05.850,00:34:07.850
"I decide to make
my friend soccer.",00:34:07.850,00:34:09.750
"Then I will face
someone who's flipping",00:34:09.750,00:34:11.400
"the same coin with maybe be
slightly different parameters.",00:34:11.400,00:34:14.780
But those things actually exist.,00:34:14.780,00:34:16.230
"There's models about how
friendships are formed.",00:34:16.230,00:34:18.750
"And the one I
described is called",00:34:18.750,00:34:22.020
the mixed-membership model.,00:34:22.020,00:34:23.177
"So those are models that
are sort of hypothesized.",00:34:23.177,00:34:25.260
"And they're more reasonable
than taking into account",00:34:25.260,00:34:29.250
"all the things that made
you meet that person",00:34:29.250,00:34:31.650
at that particular time.,00:34:31.650,00:34:34.409
"So the goal here--
so based on data now,",00:34:34.409,00:34:38.580
"once we have the model is going
to be reduced to maybe two,",00:34:38.580,00:34:41.370
"three, four
parameters, depending",00:34:41.370,00:34:42.989
on how complex the model is.,00:34:42.989,00:34:44.500
"And then your goal will be
to estimate those parameters.",00:34:44.500,00:34:48.060
"So sometimes the randomness
we have here is real.",00:34:48.060,00:34:51.610
"So there's some true
randomness in some surveys.",00:34:51.610,00:34:56.940
"If I pick a random
student, as long",00:34:56.940,00:34:58.740
"as I believe that my random
number generator that",00:34:58.740,00:35:00.870
"will pick your random
ID is actually random,",00:35:00.870,00:35:04.200
"there is something
random about you.",00:35:04.200,00:35:06.180
"The student that
I pick at random",00:35:06.180,00:35:07.950
will be a random student.,00:35:07.950,00:35:09.390
"The person that I call on
the phone is a random person.",00:35:09.390,00:35:13.540
"So there's some randomness
that I can build into my system",00:35:13.540,00:35:16.380
"by drawing something from
a random number generator.",00:35:16.380,00:35:20.310
A biased coin is a random thing.,00:35:20.310,00:35:22.512
"It's not a very
interesting random thing.",00:35:22.512,00:35:24.220
But it is a random thing.,00:35:24.220,00:35:26.100
"Again, if I wash out the
fact that it actually",00:35:26.100,00:35:29.040
is a deterministic mechanism.,00:35:29.040,00:35:30.510
"But at a certain accuracy,
a certain granularity,",00:35:30.510,00:35:33.230
"this can be thought of as
a truly random experiment.",00:35:33.230,00:35:36.090
"Measurement error for example,
if you by some measurement",00:35:36.090,00:35:39.180
device.,00:35:39.180,00:35:39.850
"or some optics
device, for example.",00:35:39.850,00:35:42.760
"You will have like standard
deviation and things that",00:35:42.760,00:35:45.020
come on the side of the box.,00:35:45.020,00:35:46.080
"And it tells you, this will be
making some measurement error.",00:35:46.080,00:35:48.621
"And it's usually thermal noise
maybe, or things like this.",00:35:48.621,00:35:51.480
"And those are very
accurately described",00:35:51.480,00:35:54.570
by some random phenomenon.,00:35:54.570,00:35:56.430
"But sometimes, and I'd say most
times, there's no randomness.",00:35:56.430,00:36:01.260
There's no randomness.,00:36:01.260,00:36:02.520
"It's not like you breaking
your iPhone is a random event.",00:36:02.520,00:36:06.810
"This is just something
that we sweep--",00:36:06.810,00:36:09.390
"randomness is a big rug
under which we sweep",00:36:09.390,00:36:11.940
everything we don't understand.,00:36:11.940,00:36:13.650

that in average we've",00:36:13.650,00:36:15.900
"captured, the average
effect of what's going on.",00:36:15.900,00:36:18.911
"And the rest of it might
fluctuate to the right,",00:36:18.911,00:36:20.910
might fluctuate to the left.,00:36:20.910,00:36:22.470
"But what remains is
just sort of randomness",00:36:22.470,00:36:26.010
that can be averaged out.,00:36:26.010,00:36:27.660
"So, of course, this is
where the leap of faith is.",00:36:27.660,00:36:31.170
"We do not know whether we
were correct of doing this.",00:36:31.170,00:36:33.480
"Maybe we make some
huge systematic biases",00:36:33.480,00:36:35.957
by doing this.,00:36:35.957,00:36:36.540
"Maybe we forget a very
important component.",00:36:36.540,00:36:39.330
"Right, for example, if I have--",00:36:39.330,00:36:42.450
"I don't know, let's
think of something--",00:36:42.450,00:36:45.816
a drug for breast cancer.,00:36:49.220,00:36:51.080
"All right, and I
throw out the fact",00:36:51.080,00:36:52.880
"that my patient is
either a man or woman.",00:36:52.880,00:36:55.640
"I'm going to have some
serious model biases.",00:36:55.640,00:36:57.530
Right.,00:36:57.530,00:36:58.030
"So if I say I'm going to
collect a random and patient.",00:36:58.030,00:37:00.645
"And said I'm going
to start doing this.",00:37:00.645,00:37:02.270
"There's some information
that I really need, clearly,",00:37:02.270,00:37:04.790
to build into my model.,00:37:04.790,00:37:06.880
"And so the model should be
complicated enough, but not too",00:37:06.880,00:37:10.730
complicated.,00:37:10.730,00:37:11.420
"Right so it should take
into account things",00:37:11.420,00:37:13.220
"there will systematically
be important.",00:37:13.220,00:37:17.375
"So, in particular, the
simple rule of thumb",00:37:17.375,00:37:19.700
"is, when you have a
complicated process,",00:37:19.700,00:37:24.620
"you can think of it as
being a simple process",00:37:24.620,00:37:26.780
and some random noise.,00:37:26.780,00:37:28.205
"Now, again, the random
noise is everything",00:37:28.205,00:37:30.320
"you don't understand about
the complicated process.",00:37:30.320,00:37:33.320
"And the simple process is
everything you actually do.",00:37:33.320,00:37:37.810
"So good modeling,
and this is not",00:37:37.810,00:37:40.600
"where we'll be
seeing in this class,",00:37:40.600,00:37:43.920
"consistent choosing
plausible simple models.",00:37:43.920,00:37:46.890
"And this requires a tremendous
amount of domain knowledge.",00:37:46.890,00:37:50.241
"And that's why we're not
doing it in this class.",00:37:50.241,00:37:52.240
"This is not something where I
can make a blanket statement",00:37:52.240,00:37:54.240
about making good modeling.,00:37:54.240,00:37:55.620
"You need to know, if I
were a statistician working",00:37:55.620,00:37:58.020
"on a study, I would have to
grill the person in front",00:37:58.020,00:38:00.990
"of me, the expert, for two hours
to know, but how about this?",00:38:00.990,00:38:04.840
How about that?,00:38:04.840,00:38:05.970
How does this work?,00:38:05.970,00:38:06.990
"So it requires to
understand a lot of things.",00:38:06.990,00:38:08.940
"There's this famous statistician
to whom this sentence is",00:38:08.940,00:38:14.070
"attributed, and it's
probably not his then,",00:38:14.070,00:38:16.640
"but Tukey said that he
loves being a statistician,",00:38:16.640,00:38:21.191
"because you get to play
in everybody's backyard.",00:38:21.191,00:38:23.190
"Right, so you get to
go and see people.",00:38:23.190,00:38:25.440
"And you get to understand, at
least to a certain extent, what",00:38:25.440,00:38:28.260
their problems are.,00:38:28.260,00:38:29.430
"Enough that you
can actually build",00:38:29.430,00:38:31.110
"a reasonable model for what
they're actually doing.",00:38:31.110,00:38:33.400
So you get to do some sociology.,00:38:33.400,00:38:34.740
You get to do some biology.,00:38:34.740,00:38:35.865
You get to do some engineering.,00:38:35.865,00:38:37.167
"And you get to do a lot
of different things.",00:38:37.167,00:38:39.000
"Right, so he was
actually at some point",00:38:39.000,00:38:40.625
"predicting the
presidential election.",00:38:40.625,00:38:46.180
"So, you see, you get to do
a lot of different things.",00:38:46.180,00:38:48.720
"But it requires a lot
of time to understand",00:38:48.720,00:38:50.850
what problem you're working on.,00:38:50.850,00:38:52.230
"And if you have a particular
application in mind",00:38:52.230,00:38:54.480
"you're the best person to
actually understand this.",00:38:54.480,00:38:56.644
"So I'm just going to
give you the basic tools.",00:38:56.644,00:38:58.560
So this is the circle of trust.,00:39:07.660,00:39:11.705
"No, this is really
just a simple graphic",00:39:11.705,00:39:14.010
that tells you what's going on.,00:39:14.010,00:39:15.840
"When you do probability,
you're given the truth.",00:39:15.840,00:39:19.170
"Somebody tells you what
die God is rolling.",00:39:19.170,00:39:24.330
"So you know exactly what the
parameters of the problems are.",00:39:24.330,00:39:27.490
"And what you're trying
to do is to describe what",00:39:27.490,00:39:29.490
the outcomes are going to be.,00:39:29.490,00:39:31.410
"You can say, if you're
rolling a fair die,",00:39:31.410,00:39:34.260
"you're going to have 1/6
of the time in your data",00:39:34.260,00:39:36.480
you're going to have one.,00:39:36.480,00:39:37.699
"1/6 of the time you're
going to have to have two.",00:39:37.699,00:39:39.740
"And so you can describe-- if
I told you what the truth is,",00:39:39.740,00:39:42.156
"you could actually
go into a computer,",00:39:42.156,00:39:44.340
either generate some data.,00:39:44.340,00:39:46.080
"Or you could describe to me
some more macro properties",00:39:46.080,00:39:51.030
of what the data would be like.,00:39:51.030,00:39:52.350
"Oh, I would see a
bunch of numbers",00:39:52.350,00:39:54.600
"that would be centered
around 35, if I",00:39:54.600,00:39:57.150
"drew from a Gaussian
distribution centered at 35.",00:39:57.150,00:40:00.182
"Right, you would know
this kind of thing.",00:40:00.182,00:40:01.890
"I would know that it's very
unlikely that if my Gaussian",00:40:01.890,00:40:07.400
has standard deviation--,00:40:07.400,00:40:08.940
"is centered on 0, say,
with standard deviation 3.",00:40:08.940,00:40:13.830
"It's very unlikely that I will
see numbers below minus 10",00:40:13.830,00:40:17.380
"in above 10, right?",00:40:17.380,00:40:18.750
"You know this, that you
basically will not see them.",00:40:18.750,00:40:21.060
"So you know from the truth,
from the distribution",00:40:21.060,00:40:25.310
"of a random variable that does
not have mu or sigmas, really",00:40:25.310,00:40:27.810
numbers there.,00:40:27.810,00:40:28.860
"You know what data,
you're going to be having.",00:40:28.860,00:40:31.980
"Statistics is about
going backwards.",00:40:31.980,00:40:33.895
"It's saying, if I have
some data, what was",00:40:33.895,00:40:37.590
the truth that generated it.,00:40:37.590,00:40:39.420
"And since there are so
many possible truths,",00:40:39.420,00:40:41.790
"Modeling says you
have to pick one",00:40:41.790,00:40:44.040
"of the simpler possible truths,
so that you can average out.",00:40:44.040,00:40:47.190
"Statistics basically
means averaging.",00:40:47.190,00:40:49.720
"You're averaging when
you do statistics.",00:40:49.720,00:40:51.540
"And averaging
means that if I say",00:40:51.540,00:40:54.150
"that I received--
so if I collect",00:40:54.150,00:40:56.790
"all your GPAs, for example.",00:40:56.790,00:40:58.230
"And my model is that
the possible GPAs",00:40:58.230,00:41:01.860
are any possible numbers.,00:41:01.860,00:41:03.450
"And anybody can have
any possible GPA.",00:41:03.450,00:41:05.297
"This is going to be
a serious problem.",00:41:05.297,00:41:06.880
"But if I can summarize
those GPAs into two numbers,",00:41:06.880,00:41:09.420
"say, mean and
standard deviation,",00:41:09.420,00:41:11.100
"than I have a pretty
good description of what",00:41:11.100,00:41:13.020
"is going on, rather
than having to have",00:41:13.020,00:41:15.360
to predict the full list.,00:41:15.360,00:41:16.730
"Right, if I learn a full
list of GPAs and I say,",00:41:16.730,00:41:18.880
well this was the distribution.,00:41:18.880,00:41:20.282
"Then it's not going to be of
any use for me to predict what",00:41:20.282,00:41:22.740
"the GPA would be, or some
random student walking in,",00:41:22.740,00:41:25.232
or something like this.,00:41:25.232,00:41:26.190
"So just to finish my rant about
probability versus statistics,",00:41:30.210,00:41:34.680
"this is a question you would
see in a probability-- this",00:41:34.680,00:41:37.230
"is a probabilistic question, and
this is a statistical question.",00:41:37.230,00:41:40.080
"The probabilistic question
is, previous studies",00:41:40.080,00:41:42.690
"showed that the drug
was 80% effective.",00:41:42.690,00:41:45.150
So you know that.,00:41:45.150,00:41:46.230
"This is the effectiveness
of the drug.",00:41:46.230,00:41:48.340
It's given to you.,00:41:48.340,00:41:49.480
This is how your problem starts.,00:41:49.480,00:41:51.480
"Then we can anticipate that,
for a study on 100 patients,",00:41:51.480,00:41:54.930
"in average, 80 be cured.",00:41:54.930,00:41:57.030
"And at least 65 will be
cured with 99% chances.",00:41:57.030,00:42:00.660
So again these are not--,00:42:00.660,00:42:03.140
"I'm not predicting on 100
patients exactly the number",00:42:03.140,00:42:05.994
"of them they're
going to be cured.",00:42:05.994,00:42:07.410
"And the number of
them that are not.",00:42:07.410,00:42:08.970
"But I'm actually
sort of predicting",00:42:08.970,00:42:11.160
"what things are going
to look like on average,",00:42:11.160,00:42:13.140
"or some macro properties of what
my data sets will look like.",00:42:13.140,00:42:17.610
"So with 99 percent
chances, that means",00:42:17.610,00:42:19.590
"that in 99.99% of the
data sets you will",00:42:19.590,00:42:23.550
draw from this particular draw.,00:42:23.550,00:42:25.770
"99.99% of the cohort of 100
patients to whom you administer",00:42:25.770,00:42:30.870
"this drug, I will be able
to conclude that at least 65",00:42:30.870,00:42:34.650
"of them will be cured, on 99.99%
percent of those data sets.",00:42:34.650,00:42:41.010
"So that's a pretty
accurate prediction",00:42:41.010,00:42:42.630
of what's going to happen.,00:42:42.630,00:42:45.060
Statistics is the opposite.,00:42:45.060,00:42:46.260
"It says, well, I just know
that 78 out of 100 were cured.",00:42:46.260,00:42:49.620
I have only one data set.,00:42:49.620,00:42:50.890
"I cannot make predictions
for all data sets.",00:42:50.890,00:42:53.340
"But I can go back
to the probability,",00:42:53.340,00:42:57.199
"make some inference about
what my probability will look",00:42:57.199,00:42:59.490
"like, and then say, OK, then
I can make those predictions",00:42:59.490,00:43:03.360
later on.,00:43:03.360,00:43:04.150
"So when I start with
78/100 then maybe",00:43:04.150,00:43:08.580
"I'm actually, in this
case, I just don't know.",00:43:08.580,00:43:11.100
"My best guess here is
that I'm confident I",00:43:11.100,00:43:16.410
"have to add the extra error that
I bet you making by predicting",00:43:16.410,00:43:19.800
"that here, the drug is not 80%
effective but 78% effective.",00:43:19.800,00:43:25.650
"And they need some
error bars around this,",00:43:25.650,00:43:27.570
"that will hopefully contain 80%,
and then based on those error",00:43:27.570,00:43:30.960
"bars I'm going to make slightly
less precise predictions",00:43:30.960,00:43:34.460
for the future.,00:43:34.460,00:43:35.456
"So, to conclude, so this
was, why statistics?",00:43:39.440,00:43:44.510
So what is this course about?,00:43:44.510,00:43:46.530
"It's about understanding
the mathematics",00:43:46.530,00:43:48.230
behind statistical methods.,00:43:48.230,00:43:50.230
It's more of a tool.,00:43:50.230,00:43:51.590
"We're not going to have fun and
talk about algebraic geometry",00:43:51.590,00:43:54.680
"just for fun in
the middle of it.",00:43:54.680,00:43:57.440
"So it justifies quantitative
statements given some modeling",00:43:57.440,00:44:01.610
"assumptions, that we
will, in this class,",00:44:01.610,00:44:03.500
"mostly admit that the modeling
assumptions are correct.",00:44:03.500,00:44:06.730
"| the first part--
in this introduction,",00:44:06.730,00:44:08.480
"we will go through
them because it's",00:44:08.480,00:44:10.442
"very easy to forget what
the assumptions are actually",00:44:10.442,00:44:12.650
making.,00:44:12.650,00:44:13.310
"But this will be a
pretty standard thing.",00:44:13.310,00:44:15.650
"The words you will
hear a lot are IID--",00:44:15.650,00:44:18.680
"independent and
identically distributed--",00:44:18.680,00:44:20.630
"that means that your data
is basically all the sams.",00:44:20.630,00:44:23.120
"And one data point is not
impacting another data point.",00:44:23.120,00:44:28.070
"Hopefully we can describe
some interesting mathematics",00:44:28.070,00:44:30.320
arising in statistics.,00:44:30.320,00:44:31.400
"You know, if you've
taken linear algebra,",00:44:31.400,00:44:33.500
maybe we can explain to you why.,00:44:33.500,00:44:36.590
"If you've done some
calculus, maybe we",00:44:36.590,00:44:38.630
"can do some
interesting calculus.",00:44:38.630,00:44:40.040
"We'll see how in the
spirit of applied math",00:44:40.040,00:44:42.980
"those things answer
interesting questions.",00:44:42.980,00:44:45.630
"And basically we'll try to
carve out a math toolbox that's",00:44:45.630,00:44:49.550
useful for us statistics.,00:44:49.550,00:44:52.300
"And maybe you can extend it
to more sophisticated methods",00:44:52.300,00:44:55.280
"that we did not
cover in this class.",00:44:55.280,00:44:57.080
"In particular in the
immersion learning class,",00:44:57.080,00:44:59.180
"hopefully you'll be able to
have some statistical intuition",00:44:59.180,00:45:02.120
about what is going on.,00:45:02.120,00:45:04.590
"So what this course
is not about,",00:45:04.590,00:45:06.680
"it's not about spending a lot
of time looking at data sets,",00:45:06.680,00:45:09.950
"and trying to understand
some statistical thinking",00:45:09.950,00:45:13.310
kind of questions.,00:45:13.310,00:45:14.330
"So this is more of an applied
statistical perspective",00:45:14.330,00:45:16.550
"on things, or more modeling.",00:45:16.550,00:45:19.760
"So I'm going to typically
give you the model.",00:45:19.760,00:45:22.150
And say this is a model.,00:45:22.150,00:45:23.510
"And this is how we're
going to build an estimator",00:45:23.510,00:45:26.480
in the framework of this model.,00:45:26.480,00:45:28.440
"So for example, 18.075,
to a certain extent,",00:45:28.440,00:45:30.820

Thinking and Data Analysis.""",00:45:30.820,00:45:32.945

too little time in a semester.",00:45:38.840,00:45:42.270

are giving you some overview.",00:45:42.270,00:45:45.840

these days are R",00:45:45.840,00:45:49.355
"is the leading software I'd say
in statistics, both in academia",00:45:49.355,00:45:54.830
"and industry, lots of
packages, one every day",00:45:54.830,00:45:58.100
that's probably coming out.,00:45:58.100,00:46:00.140
"But there's other things,
right, so now Python is probably",00:46:00.140,00:46:03.410
"catching up with all these
scikit-learn packages that",00:46:03.410,00:46:09.110
are coming up.,00:46:09.110,00:46:10.130
"Julia has some
statistics in there,",00:46:10.130,00:46:14.300
"but it really if you were to
learn a statistical software,",00:46:14.300,00:46:17.867
"let's say you love
doing this, this",00:46:17.867,00:46:19.325
"would be the one that would
prove most useful for you",00:46:19.325,00:46:21.590

to high dimensional data.",00:46:22.190,00:46:26.700

an IDSS that actually",00:46:26.700,00:46:28.550

with Peter Kempthorne,",00:46:37.850,00:46:40.130

"And so Peter Kempthorne
will be teaching it.",00:46:50.830,00:46:55.880

will actually focus",00:46:55.880,00:46:58.620
"on using R. And
even beyond that,",00:46:58.620,00:47:00.807

to be about using.",00:47:00.807,00:47:02.390
"It's going to be
about understanding--",00:47:02.390,00:47:04.285

we're going to see",00:47:04.285,00:47:05.910

you do statistics,",00:47:05.910,00:47:07.980

maximum likelihood estimator.",00:47:12.531,00:47:15.030

some function.",00:47:15.030,00:47:16.910

toolbox to do that.",00:47:16.910,00:47:19.120

can have specialized",00:47:19.120,00:47:20.970
"for statistics
for that, and what",00:47:20.970,00:47:22.800
are the principles behind it.,00:47:22.800,00:47:25.340
"And you know, of
course, if you've",00:47:25.340,00:47:26.990
"taken AP stats you
probably think that stats",00:47:26.990,00:47:29.230
"is boring to death
because it was just",00:47:29.230,00:47:31.250
"a long laundry-list that
spent a lot of time on t-test.",00:47:31.250,00:47:34.310
"I'm pretty sure we're not going
to talk about t-test, well,",00:47:34.310,00:47:37.010
maybe once.,00:47:37.010,00:47:38.480
"But this is not a matter of
saying you're going to do this.",00:47:38.480,00:47:42.200
"And this is a slight
variant of it.",00:47:42.200,00:47:43.670
"We're going to really try to
understand what's going on.",00:47:43.670,00:47:46.160

not chosen the simplest way",00:47:46.160,00:47:49.820
"to get an A in
statistics on campus.",00:47:49.820,00:47:52.580
"All right, this is
not the easiest class.",00:47:52.580,00:47:54.470
"It might be
challenging at times,",00:47:54.470,00:47:56.000
"but I can promise you that
you will maybe suffer.",00:47:56.000,00:47:59.674
"But you will learn
something by the time",00:47:59.674,00:48:01.340
you're out of this class.,00:48:01.340,00:48:02.381
"This will not be a
waste of your time.",00:48:02.381,00:48:04.550
"And you will be
able to understand,",00:48:04.550,00:48:06.560
"and not having to remember by
heart how those things actually",00:48:06.560,00:48:09.230
work.,00:48:09.230,00:48:10.680
Are there any questions?,00:48:10.680,00:48:13.750
"Anybody want to go to other
stats class on campus?",00:48:13.750,00:48:16.910
Maybe it's not too late.,00:48:16.910,00:48:18.860
OK.,00:48:18.860,00:48:21.360
So let's do some statistics.,00:48:21.360,00:48:25.280
"So I see the time
now and it's 11:56,",00:48:25.280,00:48:29.600
so we have another 30 minutes.,00:48:29.600,00:48:31.800
"I will typically
give you a three,",00:48:31.800,00:48:35.880

you want to stretch,",00:48:35.880,00:48:37.820

"if you want to check
your texts or Instagram.",00:48:39.278,00:48:45.220
"There was very little
content in this class,",00:48:45.220,00:48:47.510
"hopefully it was
entertaining enough",00:48:47.510,00:48:49.010
that you don't need the break.,00:48:49.010,00:48:51.170
"But just in the future, so you
know you will have a break.",00:48:51.170,00:48:55.510
"So statistics, this is how it
starts, I'm French, what can",00:48:55.510,00:49:01.670
"I say I need to put
some French words.",00:49:01.670,00:49:05.750

hours are going to go down.",00:49:05.750,00:49:08.450

by a Rodin, The Kiss.",00:49:12.410,00:49:16.370

Thinker is more famous.",00:49:16.370,00:49:18.520
"But this is actually
a pretty famous one.",00:49:18.520,00:49:20.240

one, or is it this one.",00:49:20.240,00:49:23.830

pronounce yourself with no data",00:49:42.950,00:49:45.770
actually to make any decision.,00:49:45.770,00:49:47.160
This is a total coin toss right.,00:49:47.160,00:49:49.640

is data, and there",00:49:49.640,00:49:51.340

journal Nature,",00:49:51.340,00:49:53.930

very serious paper which",00:49:53.930,00:49:56.210
actually looks pretty serious.,00:49:56.210,00:49:58.235

like ""Human Behavior:",00:49:58.235,00:50:00.110

"And this, I'm not
kidding you, this study",00:50:04.930,00:50:07.310
"is about collecting
data of people kissing,",00:50:07.310,00:50:09.830

their head to the right",00:50:09.830,00:50:12.080
"or if they bend they
head to the left.",00:50:12.080,00:50:14.130

this class I was like,",00:50:38.900,00:50:41.250

argue, so this person",00:50:55.370,00:50:57.140

out in airports",00:50:57.140,00:51:00.890

kissing and collecting data.",00:51:00.890,00:51:06.740

did he just not stay home",00:51:06.740,00:51:10.970

particular reason why",00:51:28.220,00:51:29.420

they've been directed to kiss",00:52:00.700,00:52:03.440

natural thing to do.",00:52:03.440,00:52:06.060

blah, and put some variables,",00:52:53.770,00:52:57.760

about those variables.",00:52:57.760,00:52:59.990

"used very much in
statistics for parameters.",00:53:02.540,00:53:04.870

it's appearing in Nature,",00:53:58.930,00:54:01.120

about a bunch of them.,00:54:27.380,00:54:29.667
"And we know that, in this
thing, there's basically",00:54:29.667,00:54:31.750
"a proportion of
them, that's like p,",00:54:31.750,00:54:33.521
"and that's the proportion
of them that's bending",00:54:33.521,00:54:35.520
their head to the right.,00:54:35.520,00:54:36.570
"And so everybody on this side
is bending their heads right.",00:54:36.570,00:54:40.050
"And hopefully we
can actually sample",00:54:40.050,00:54:41.550
this thing you're informing.,00:54:41.550,00:54:42.716
"That's basically the
process that's going on.",00:54:42.716,00:54:44.640
"So this is the
statistical experiment.",00:54:44.640,00:54:47.250
"We're going to observe
n kissing couples.",00:54:47.250,00:54:49.589
"So here we're going to put
as many variables as we can.",00:54:49.589,00:54:51.880
"So we don't have to
stick with numbers.",00:54:51.880,00:54:53.505
"And then we'll just
plug in the numbers.",00:54:53.505,00:54:55.630
"n kissing couples, and n
is also, in statistics,",00:54:55.630,00:54:58.450
"by the way, n is the size of
your sample 99.9% of the time.",00:54:58.450,00:55:04.320
"And collect the value
of each outcome.",00:55:04.320,00:55:06.720
So we want numbers.,00:55:06.720,00:55:07.530
We don't want right or left.,00:55:07.530,00:55:08.696
"So we're going to code them
by 0 and 1, pretty naturally.",00:55:08.696,00:55:12.300
"And then we're going to
estimate p which is unknown.",00:55:12.300,00:55:16.890
So p is this area.,00:55:16.890,00:55:18.229
"And we're going to
estimate it simply",00:55:18.229,00:55:19.770
"by the proportion of right
So the proportion of crosses",00:55:19.770,00:55:24.570
"that actually fell
in the right side.",00:55:24.570,00:55:27.030
"So in this study
what you will find",00:55:29.660,00:55:33.340
"is that the numbers
that were collected",00:55:33.340,00:55:36.460
"were 124 couples, and that,
out of those 124, 80 of them",00:55:36.460,00:55:43.690
turned their head to the right.,00:55:43.690,00:55:46.570
"So, p hat is a proportion.",00:55:46.570,00:55:49.240
How do we do it?,00:55:49.240,00:55:50.020
"Well, you don't need
statistics for that.",00:55:50.020,00:55:51.880
"You're going to see
80 divided by 124.",00:55:51.880,00:55:54.790
"And you will find that
in this particular study",00:55:54.790,00:55:57.580
"64.5% of the
couples were bending",00:55:57.580,00:56:00.139
their heads to the right.,00:56:00.139,00:56:01.180
"That's a pretty
large number, right?",00:56:01.180,00:56:03.040
"The question is if I picked
another 124 couples, maybe",00:56:03.040,00:56:07.180
"at different airports, different
times, would I see same number?",00:56:07.180,00:56:10.240
"Would this number be
all over the place?",00:56:10.240,00:56:11.920
"Would it be sometimes very
close to 120, or sometimes",00:56:11.920,00:56:14.650
for close to 10?,00:56:14.650,00:56:15.850
"Or would it be-- is this number
actually fluctuating a lot.",00:56:15.850,00:56:20.020
"And so, hopefully not too much,
64.5 percent is definitely",00:56:20.020,00:56:26.870
much larger than 50%.,00:56:26.870,00:56:28.670
"And so there seems to
be this preference.",00:56:28.670,00:56:31.652
"Now we're going to
have to quantify",00:56:31.652,00:56:33.110
how much of this preference.,00:56:33.110,00:56:34.276
"Is this number significantly
larger than 50%?",00:56:34.276,00:56:38.240
"So if our data, for example,
was just three couples.",00:56:38.240,00:56:41.090
"I'm just going there,
I'm going to Logan.",00:56:41.090,00:56:43.370
"I call it, I do
right, left right.",00:56:43.370,00:56:45.440
And then I see--,00:56:45.440,00:56:47.570
"see what's the name of
the fish place there?",00:56:47.570,00:56:53.060
"I go to I go to Wahlburgers
at Logan and I'm like,",00:56:53.060,00:56:56.399
"OK, I'm done for the day.",00:56:56.399,00:56:57.440
I collect this data.,00:56:57.440,00:56:58.610
"I go home, and I'm like,
wow, 66.7% to the right.",00:56:58.610,00:57:02.120
That's a pretty big number.,00:57:02.120,00:57:03.380
"It's even farther from
50% than this other guy.",00:57:03.380,00:57:06.650
So I'm doing even better.,00:57:06.650,00:57:08.315
"But of course you know
that this is not true.",00:57:08.315,00:57:10.190
"Three people is definitely
not representative.",00:57:10.190,00:57:12.237
"If I stopped at the
first one, I would",00:57:12.237,00:57:13.820
"have actually-- at the first
two, I would have even 100%.",00:57:13.820,00:57:18.360
"So the question that statistics
is going to help us answer is,",00:57:18.360,00:57:21.290
how large should the sample be?,00:57:21.290,00:57:23.514
"For some reason, I don't know
if you guys receive this,",00:57:23.514,00:57:25.805
"I'm an affiliate with
the Broad Institute,",00:57:25.805,00:57:27.554
"and since then I receive
one email per day",00:57:27.554,00:57:30.050
"that says, sample
size determination--",00:57:30.050,00:57:32.240
how large should your sample be?,00:57:32.240,00:57:33.950
"Like, I know how large
should with my sample be.",00:57:33.950,00:57:36.040
"I've taken 18.650
multiple times.",00:57:36.040,00:57:39.530
"And so I know, but the
question is-- is 124",00:57:39.530,00:57:43.240
a large enough number or not?,00:57:43.240,00:57:45.270
"Well, the answer is actually,
as usual, it depends.",00:57:45.270,00:57:47.540
"It will depend on the
true unknown value of p.",00:57:47.540,00:57:51.310
"But from those particular
values that we got, so 120 and--",00:57:51.310,00:57:56.590
how many couples was there?,00:57:56.590,00:57:57.870
80?,00:57:57.870,00:57:58.750
"We actually can
make some question.",00:57:58.750,00:58:02.240
"So here we said that
80 was larger than 50--",00:58:02.240,00:58:07.750
"was allowing us to
conclude at 64.5%.",00:58:07.750,00:58:12.310
"So it could be one reason to
say that it was larger than 50%.",00:58:12.310,00:58:17.520
50% of 124 is 62.,00:58:17.520,00:58:23.230
"So the question is,
would I be would I",00:58:23.230,00:58:24.910
"be willing to make
this conclusion at 63?",00:58:24.910,00:58:28.750
"Is that a number that
would convince you?",00:58:28.750,00:58:30.630
Who would be convinced by 63?,00:58:30.630,00:58:34.030
who would be convinced by 72?,00:58:34.030,00:58:35.465
Who would be convinced by 75?,00:58:38.410,00:58:40.404
"Hopefully the number of hands
that are raised should grow.",00:58:40.404,00:58:42.820
Who would be convinced by 80?,00:58:46.120,00:58:48.820
"All right, so basically
those numbers actually",00:58:48.820,00:58:51.190
don't come from anywhere.,00:58:51.190,00:58:52.720
"This 72 would be the number that
you would need for a study--",00:58:52.720,00:58:56.740
"most statistical studies
would be the number",00:58:56.740,00:58:58.662
that they would retain.,00:58:58.662,00:58:59.620
That's not for 124.,00:58:59.620,00:59:01.870
"You would need to see
72 that turn their head",00:59:01.870,00:59:04.360
"right to actually
make this conclusion.",00:59:04.360,00:59:07.390
And then 75--,00:59:07.390,00:59:08.977
"So we'll see that there's many
ways to come to this conclusion",00:59:08.977,00:59:11.560
"because, as you
can see, this was",00:59:11.560,00:59:12.934
published in Nature with 80.,00:59:12.934,00:59:15.250
So that was OK.,00:59:15.250,00:59:15.920
"So 80 is actually a
very large number.",00:59:15.920,00:59:17.503
This is 99 point--,00:59:17.503,00:59:20.116
"this 99% -- no, so
this is 95% confidence.",00:59:20.116,00:59:24.250
This is 99% confidence.,00:59:24.250,00:59:26.290
"And this is 99.9%
percent confidence.",00:59:26.290,00:59:29.330
"So if you said 80 you're a
very conservative person.",00:59:29.330,00:59:34.210
"Starting at 72, you can
start making this conclusion.",00:59:34.210,00:59:36.930
"To understand
this, we need to do",00:59:39.820,00:59:41.260
"our little mathematical
kitchen here,",00:59:41.260,00:59:45.880
and we need to do some modeling.,00:59:45.880,00:59:49.810
"So we need to
understand by modeling--",00:59:49.810,00:59:51.460
"we need understand what
random process we think",00:59:51.460,00:59:55.000
this data is generating from.,00:59:55.000,00:59:57.190
"So it's going to have
some unknown parameters,",00:59:57.190,00:59:59.180
unlike in probability.,00:59:59.180,01:00:00.190
"But we need to have just
basically everything written",01:00:00.190,01:00:02.800
"except for the values
of the parameters.",01:00:02.800,01:00:04.900
"When I said a die is coming
uniformly with probably 1/6",01:00:04.900,01:00:08.530
"then I need to have, say
maybe with probability-- maybe",01:00:08.530,01:00:12.220
"I should say here
are six numbers,",01:00:12.220,01:00:14.260
"and I need to just
fill those numbers.",01:00:14.260,01:00:18.550
"So for i equal 1 to
n, I'm going to define",01:00:18.550,01:00:23.140
Ri to be the indicator.,01:00:23.140,01:00:27.140
"An indicator is just something
that takes value 1 if something",01:00:27.140,01:00:29.950
"is true, and 0 if not.",01:00:29.950,01:00:31.330
"So it's an indicator
that i-th couple",01:00:31.330,01:00:34.450
turns the head to the right.,01:00:34.450,01:00:36.820
"So, Ri, so it's indexed by i.",01:00:36.820,01:00:39.580
"And it's one if the i-th couple
turns their head to the right,",01:00:39.580,01:00:42.290
and 0 if it's--,01:00:42.290,01:00:45.820
"well actually, I guess they can
probably kiss straight, right?",01:00:45.820,01:00:48.640
"So that would be weird, but
they might be able to do this.",01:00:48.640,01:00:51.500
So let's say not right.,01:00:51.500,01:00:54.280
"Then the estimator of
p, we said, was p hat.",01:00:54.280,01:00:56.710
"It was just the
ratio of two numbers.",01:00:56.710,01:00:58.360
"But really what it is is
I count, I sum those Ri's.",01:00:58.360,01:01:02.410
"Since I only add those that
take value 1, what this is is--",01:01:02.410,01:01:07.360
"this sum here is actually just
counting the number of 1's.",01:01:07.360,01:01:10.330
"Which is another way to say it's
counting the number of couples",01:01:10.330,01:01:13.810
that are kissing to the right.,01:01:13.810,01:01:15.620
"And here I don't even
have to tell you anything",01:01:15.620,01:01:18.520
about the numbers or anything.,01:01:18.520,01:01:20.230
I can only keep track of--,01:01:20.230,01:01:21.940
"first couple is a 0
second couple is a 1,",01:01:21.940,01:01:24.240
third couple is 0.,01:01:24.240,01:01:25.251
"The data set-- you can
actually find it online--",01:01:25.251,01:01:27.250
"is actually a sequence
of 0's and 1's.",01:01:27.250,01:01:29.646
"Now clearly for the
question that we're",01:01:29.646,01:01:31.270
"asking about this
proportion, I don't",01:01:31.270,01:01:32.950
"need to keep track of
all this information.",01:01:32.950,01:01:34.980
"All I need to keep
track of is the number",01:01:34.980,01:01:37.150
of 0's and the number of 1's.,01:01:37.150,01:01:39.130
"Those are completely
interchangeable.",01:01:39.130,01:01:42.340
There's no time effect in this.,01:01:42.340,01:01:44.440
"The first couple is no
different than the 15th couple.",01:01:44.440,01:01:48.370
So we call this Rn bar.,01:01:48.370,01:01:50.380
"That's going to be a very
standard notation that we use.",01:01:50.380,01:01:52.960
"R might be replaced by
other letters like x--",01:01:52.960,01:01:55.780
"so xn bar, yn bar.",01:01:55.780,01:01:58.150
"And this thing
essentially means that I",01:01:58.150,01:02:00.700
"average the R's, or the
Ri's over n of them.",01:02:00.700,01:02:04.630
And the bar means the average.,01:02:04.630,01:02:06.100
"So I divide by n the
total number of 1's.",01:02:06.100,01:02:09.460
"So here this sum was equal
to 80 in our example and n",01:02:09.460,01:02:13.630
was equal to 124.,01:02:13.630,01:02:16.820
Now this is an estimator.,01:02:16.820,01:02:18.370
"So an estimator is
different from an estimate.",01:02:18.370,01:02:20.380
An estimate is a number.,01:02:20.380,01:02:21.580
My estimate was 64.5.,01:02:21.580,01:02:23.680
"My estimator is this thing where
I keep all the variables free.",01:02:23.680,01:02:29.502
"And in particular, I
keep those variables",01:02:29.502,01:02:31.210
"to be random because I'm going
to think of a random couple",01:02:31.210,01:02:34.720
"kissing left to right as the
outcome of a random process,",01:02:34.720,01:02:37.360
"just like flipping a coin
be getting heads or tails.",01:02:37.360,01:02:41.320
"And so this thing here
is a random variable, Ri.",01:02:41.320,01:02:43.626
"And this average is, of course,
an average of random variables.",01:02:43.626,01:02:46.250
It's itself a random variable.,01:02:46.250,01:02:47.500
"So an estimator is
a random variable.",01:02:47.500,01:02:49.330
"An estimate is the realization
of a random variable,",01:02:49.330,01:02:51.972
"or, in other words,
is the value that you",01:02:51.972,01:02:53.680
"get for this random variable
once you plug in the numbers",01:02:53.680,01:02:56.140
that you've collected.,01:02:56.140,01:02:58.960
"So I can talk about the
accuracy of an estimator.",01:02:58.960,01:03:01.030
Accuracy means what?,01:03:01.030,01:03:02.470
"Well, what would we
want for an estimator?",01:03:02.470,01:03:04.950
"Maybe we won't want it
to fluctuate too much.",01:03:04.950,01:03:06.892
It's a random variable.,01:03:06.892,01:03:07.850
"So I'm talking about the
accuracy of a random variable.",01:03:07.850,01:03:11.050
"So maybe I don't want
it to be too volatile.",01:03:11.050,01:03:13.740
"I could have one
estimator which would be--",01:03:13.740,01:03:16.440
"just throw out 182
couples, keep only 2",01:03:16.440,01:03:20.010
and average those two numbers.,01:03:20.010,01:03:21.420
"That's definitely
a worse estimator",01:03:21.420,01:03:23.040
than keeping all of the 124.,01:03:23.040,01:03:25.140
"So I need to find
a way to say that.",01:03:25.140,01:03:26.641
"And what I'm going
to be able to say",01:03:26.641,01:03:28.140
"is that the number is
going to be fluctuating.",01:03:28.140,01:03:30.060
"If I take another
two couples, I'm",01:03:30.060,01:03:31.669
"going to be I'm
probably going to get",01:03:31.669,01:03:33.210
a completely different number.,01:03:33.210,01:03:34.590
"But if I take another 124
couples two days later,",01:03:34.590,01:03:38.400
"maybe I'm going to have
a very number that's",01:03:38.400,01:03:40.260
very close to 64.5%.,01:03:40.260,01:03:43.140
So that's one way.,01:03:43.140,01:03:43.969
"The other thing we would like
about this estimator it's",01:03:43.969,01:03:46.260
actually--,01:03:46.260,01:03:47.767
"maybe it's not too
volatile-- but also",01:03:47.767,01:03:49.350
"we want it to be close to the
number that we're looking for.",01:03:49.350,01:03:54.300
Here is an estimator.,01:03:54.300,01:03:55.410
It's a beautiful variable.,01:03:55.410,01:03:57.150
"72%, that's an estimator.",01:03:57.150,01:04:00.330
"Go out there just do
your favorite study",01:04:00.330,01:04:02.520
about drug performance.,01:04:02.520,01:04:06.310
"And then they're going to
call you, MIT student taking",01:04:06.310,01:04:10.440
"statistics, they
say, so how are you",01:04:10.440,01:04:12.011
going to build your estimator?,01:04:12.011,01:04:13.260
"We've collected those 5,000
or something like that.",01:04:13.260,01:04:15.450
I'm just going to spit out 72%.,01:04:15.450,01:04:17.160
"Whatever the data says,
that's an estimator.",01:04:17.160,01:04:19.200
"It's a stupid estimator
but it is an estimator.",01:04:19.200,01:04:21.510
"But this is estimator
is very not volatile.",01:04:21.510,01:04:23.360
"Every time you're going
to have a new study,",01:04:23.360,01:04:25.390
"even if you change fields,
it's still going to be 72%.",01:04:25.390,01:04:27.640
This is beautiful.,01:04:27.640,01:04:29.190
"And the problem is
that's probably not",01:04:29.190,01:04:31.590
"very close to the value you're
actually trying to estimate.",01:04:31.590,01:04:34.164
So we need two things.,01:04:34.164,01:04:35.080
"We need are estimated
to be a random variable.",01:04:35.080,01:04:36.996
So think in terms of densities.,01:04:36.996,01:04:39.240
"We want the density
to be pretty narrow.",01:04:39.240,01:04:42.740
"We want this thing
to have very little--",01:04:42.740,01:04:46.240
"so this is definitely
better than this.",01:04:46.240,01:04:52.570
"But also, we want the number
that we're interested in, p,",01:04:52.570,01:04:55.830
to be very close to this--,01:04:55.830,01:04:57.475
"to be close to the values that
this thing is likely to take.",01:04:57.475,01:05:00.260
"If p is here, this is
not very good for us.",01:05:00.260,01:05:04.020
"So that's basically the things
we're going to be looking at.",01:05:04.020,01:05:06.872
"The first one is
referred to as variance.",01:05:06.872,01:05:08.580
"The second one is
referred to as bias.",01:05:08.580,01:05:10.163
"Those things come all
over in statistics.",01:05:10.163,01:05:14.380
"So we need to
understand a model.",01:05:14.380,01:05:16.810
"So here's the model that we have
for this particular problem.",01:05:16.810,01:05:20.907
"So we need to make assumptions
on the observations",01:05:20.907,01:05:22.990
that we see.,01:05:22.990,01:05:23.650
"So we said we're going to assume
that the random variable--",01:05:23.650,01:05:25.620
"that's not too much
of a leap of faith.",01:05:25.620,01:05:27.160
"We're just sweeping under
the rug everything thing",01:05:27.160,01:05:29.243
"we don't understand
about those couples.",01:05:29.243,01:05:31.180
"And the assumption
that we make is",01:05:31.180,01:05:33.130
that Ri is a random variable.,01:05:33.130,01:05:36.000
"This one you will
forget very soon.",01:05:36.000,01:05:38.120
"The second one is that
each of the Ri's is--",01:05:38.120,01:05:41.950
"so it's a random variable
that takes value 0 or 1.",01:05:41.950,01:05:45.310
"Anybody can suggest
the distribution",01:05:45.310,01:05:47.024
for this random variable?,01:05:47.024,01:05:48.065
AUDIENCE: Bernoulli.,01:05:48.065,01:05:49.363
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: What?,01:05:49.363,01:05:50.363
AUDIENCE: Bernoulli.,01:05:50.363,01:05:51.500
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Bernoulli, right?",01:05:51.500,01:05:51.980
And it's actually beautiful.,01:05:51.980,01:05:53.210
"This is where you have to do
the least statistical modeling.",01:05:53.210,01:05:56.770
"A random variable that
takes value 0 or 1",01:05:56.770,01:05:59.164
is always a Bernoulli.,01:05:59.164,01:06:00.080
"That's the simplest variable
you can ever think of.",01:06:00.080,01:06:02.581
"Any variable that takes
only two possible values",01:06:02.581,01:06:04.580
can be reduced to a Bernoulli.,01:06:04.580,01:06:06.155
"OK, so this is a Bernoulli.",01:06:06.155,01:06:10.421
"And here we make the
assumption that it actually",01:06:10.421,01:06:12.420
takes parameter p.,01:06:12.420,01:06:16.140
And there's an assumption here.,01:06:16.140,01:06:17.850
"Anybody can tell me
what the assumption is?",01:06:17.850,01:06:21.427
AUDIENCE: It's the same.,01:06:21.427,01:06:22.780
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
Yeah, it's same, right?",01:06:22.780,01:06:24.530
"I could have said
p i, but it's p.",01:06:24.530,01:06:26.194
"And that's where I'm
going to be able to start",01:06:26.194,01:06:28.110
getting to do some statistics.,01:06:28.110,01:06:29.360
"It's that I'm going to start
to be able to pull information",01:06:29.360,01:06:31.930
across all my guys.,01:06:31.930,01:06:32.896
"If I assume that
they're all pi's",01:06:32.896,01:06:34.270
"completely uncoupled
with each other.",01:06:34.270,01:06:36.340
Then I'm in trouble.,01:06:36.340,01:06:37.480
"There's nothing I
can actually get.",01:06:37.480,01:06:39.741
"And then I'm going to
assume that those guys are",01:06:39.741,01:06:41.740
mutually independent.,01:06:41.740,01:06:42.940
"And most of the time they
will just say independent.",01:06:42.940,01:06:45.530
"Meaning that, it's not like all
these guys called each other",01:06:45.530,01:06:48.760
and it's actually a flash mob.,01:06:48.760,01:06:50.110
"And they were like, let's all
turn our left side to the left.",01:06:50.110,01:06:53.200
"And then this is
definitely not going",01:06:53.200,01:06:54.790
to give you a valid conclusion.,01:06:54.790,01:06:59.910
"So, again. randomness is
a way of modeling lack",01:06:59.910,01:07:02.400
of information.,01:07:02.400,01:07:03.210
"Here there is a way
to figure it out.",01:07:03.210,01:07:05.409
"Maybe I could have
followed all those guys,",01:07:05.409,01:07:07.200
"and knew exactly what
they were-- maybe",01:07:07.200,01:07:09.040
"I could have looked at
pictures of them in the womb",01:07:09.040,01:07:11.670
"and guess how they were
turning-- by the way that's",01:07:11.670,01:07:14.354
"one of the conclusions,
they're guessing",01:07:14.354,01:07:16.020
"that we turn our
head to the right",01:07:16.020,01:07:17.436
"because our head is turned
to the right in the womb.",01:07:17.436,01:07:21.180
"So we don't know what goes
on in the kissers minds.",01:07:21.180,01:07:24.840
"And there's, you know,
physics, sociology.",01:07:24.840,01:07:26.730
"There's a lot of things
that could help us,",01:07:26.730,01:07:28.521
"but it's just too
complicated to keep track of,",01:07:28.521,01:07:31.220
"or too expensive
for many instances",01:07:31.220,01:07:34.550
"Now again, the nicest
part of this modeling",01:07:34.550,01:07:37.310
"was the fact that Ri's
take only two values, which",01:07:37.310,01:07:39.560
"mean that this conclusion
that they were Bernoulli",01:07:39.560,01:07:41.900
was totally free for us.,01:07:41.900,01:07:43.220
"Once we know it's a random
variable, it's a Bernoulli.",01:07:43.220,01:07:45.530
"Now they could have
been, as we said,",01:07:45.530,01:07:47.720
"they could have been a
Bernoulli with parameter p i.",01:07:47.720,01:07:51.910
"For each i, I could have
put a different parameter,",01:07:51.910,01:07:55.420
"but I just don't have
enough information.",01:07:55.420,01:07:57.672
What would I have said?,01:07:57.672,01:07:58.630
"I would say, well the first
couple turned to the right.",01:07:58.630,01:08:00.921
"p1 has to be one,
that's my best guess.",01:08:00.921,01:08:04.600
"The second couple
kiss to the left,",01:08:04.600,01:08:06.910
"well, p2 should be 0,
that's my best guess.",01:08:06.910,01:08:10.690
"And so basically I
need to have to be",01:08:10.690,01:08:14.710
able to average my information.,01:08:14.710,01:08:16.240
"And the way I do it is by
coupling all these guys,",01:08:16.240,01:08:19.649
pi's to be the same p for all i.,01:08:19.649,01:08:22.490
"OK, does it make sense?",01:08:22.490,01:08:23.840
"Here what I am assuming is that
my population is homogeneous.",01:08:23.840,01:08:28.984
Maybe it's not.,01:08:28.984,01:08:29.609
"Maybe I could actually
look at a finer grain,",01:08:29.609,01:08:31.484
"but I'm basically making a
statement about a population.",01:08:31.484,01:08:35.529
"And so maybe you kiss to the
left, and then you're not--",01:08:35.529,01:08:41.670
"I'm not making a statement
about a person individually,",01:08:41.670,01:08:44.010
"I'm making a statement about
the overall population.",01:08:44.010,01:08:47.702
"Now independence is
probably reasonable, right?",01:08:47.702,01:08:49.660
"This person just went
and know can seriously",01:08:49.660,01:08:53.080
"hope that these couples did not
communicate with each other.",01:08:53.080,01:08:56.109
"Or that you know Tanya did
not text that we should all",01:08:56.109,01:08:59.830
turn our head to the left now.,01:08:59.830,01:09:01.810
"And there's no external
stimulus that forces people",01:09:01.810,01:09:05.050
to do something different.,01:09:05.050,01:09:08.069
"OK, so-- sorry about that.",01:09:08.069,01:09:15.810
"Since we have about
less than 10 minutes.",01:09:15.810,01:09:19.899
"Let's do a little bit of
exercises, is that OK with you?",01:09:19.899,01:09:22.260
"So I just have some
exercises so we can see what",01:09:22.260,01:09:24.950
an exercise going to look like.,01:09:24.950,01:09:26.580
"This is sort of similar to the
exercises you will see with me.",01:09:26.580,01:09:30.090
"We should do it together, OK?",01:09:30.090,01:09:31.674
So now we're going to have--,01:09:31.674,01:09:32.840
I have a test.,01:09:32.840,01:09:33.479
"So that's an exam
in probability.",01:09:36.630,01:09:42.950
OK.,01:09:42.950,01:09:44.290
"And I'm going to have 15
students in this test.",01:09:44.290,01:09:50.899
"And hopefully, this
should be 15 grades",01:09:50.899,01:09:53.550
"that are representative of the
grades of all a large class.",01:09:53.550,01:09:57.210
"Right, so if you go you know
18.600, it's a large class,",01:09:57.210,01:10:00.660
"there's definitely
more than 15 students.",01:10:00.660,01:10:02.430
"And maybe, just by sampling
15 students at random,",01:10:02.430,01:10:04.750
"I want to have an idea of what
my grade distribution will",01:10:04.750,01:10:08.010
look like.,01:10:08.010,01:10:09.090
"I'm grading them, I want
to make an educated guess.",01:10:09.090,01:10:13.230
"So I'm going to make
some modeling assumptions",01:10:13.230,01:10:15.480
for those guys.,01:10:15.480,01:10:16.680
"So here, 15 students and
the grades are x1 to x15.",01:10:16.680,01:10:22.830
"Just like we had R1,
R2, all the way to R124.",01:10:22.830,01:10:26.050
Those were my Ri's.,01:10:26.050,01:10:27.790
And so now I have my xi's.,01:10:27.790,01:10:29.610
"And I'm going to
assume that xi follows",01:10:29.610,01:10:33.270
"a Gaussian or normal
distribution with min mu",01:10:33.270,01:10:39.060
and variance sigma squared.,01:10:39.060,01:10:40.720
"Now this is modeling, right?",01:10:40.720,01:10:43.710
"Nobody told me there's
no physical process that",01:10:43.710,01:10:45.720
makes this happen.,01:10:45.720,01:10:46.471
"We know that there's something
called the central limit",01:10:46.471,01:10:48.761
"theorem in the background
that says that things",01:10:48.761,01:10:50.720
"tend to be Gaussian, but this is
really a matter of convenience.",01:10:50.720,01:10:53.385
"Actually this is, if
you think about it,",01:10:53.385,01:10:55.090
"this is terrible because this
puts non-zero probability",01:10:55.090,01:10:57.381
on negative scores.,01:10:57.381,01:10:58.260
"I'm definitely not going
to get a negative score.",01:10:58.260,01:11:00.711
"But you know it's good
enough because they",01:11:00.711,01:11:02.460
"know the probabilities
non-zero but it's probably 10",01:11:02.460,01:11:05.310
to the minus 12.,01:11:05.310,01:11:06.240
"So I would be very unlucky
to see a negative score.",01:11:06.240,01:11:10.480
"So here's the list of grades, so
I have 65, 41, 70, 90, 58, 82,",01:11:10.480,01:11:24.740
"76, 78--",01:11:24.740,01:11:28.860
"maybe I should have done
it with 8 --59, 59--",01:11:28.860,01:11:35.660
"sitting next to each other
--84, 89, 134, 51, and 72.",01:11:35.660,01:11:47.360
"So those are the
scores that I got.",01:11:47.360,01:11:51.440
"There were clearly some
bonus points over there.",01:11:51.440,01:11:53.930
"And the question is,
find estimator for mu.",01:11:53.930,01:12:05.134
What is my estimator for mu?,01:12:05.134,01:12:06.300
"Well, an estimator,
again, is something that",01:12:09.120,01:12:11.070
depends on the random variable.,01:12:11.070,01:12:12.510
"All right, so mu is
the expectation, right?",01:12:12.510,01:12:15.180
"So a good estimator is
definitely the average score,",01:12:15.180,01:12:22.510
"just like we had the
average of the Ri's.",01:12:22.510,01:12:24.460
"Now the xi's no longer need
to be 0's and 1's, so it's not",01:12:24.460,01:12:28.210
"going to boil down to being
a number of ones divided",01:12:28.210,01:12:31.060
by the total numbers.,01:12:31.060,01:12:32.880
"Now if I'm looking
for an estimate,",01:12:32.880,01:12:41.070
"well, I need to actually
sum those numbers",01:12:41.070,01:12:43.680
and divide them by 15.,01:12:43.680,01:12:45.630
"So my estimate is
going to be 1/15.",01:12:45.630,01:12:47.472
"Then I'm going to start
summing those numbers--",01:12:47.472,01:12:49.430
65 plus 72.,01:12:49.430,01:12:51.430
"OK, and I can do
it, and it's 67.5.",01:12:54.320,01:13:06.340
This is my estimate.,01:13:06.340,01:13:08.810
"Now if I want to compute
a standard deviation--",01:13:08.810,01:13:13.810
so let's say estimate for sigma.,01:13:13.810,01:13:18.690
"You've seen that before, right?",01:13:21.889,01:13:23.180
An estimate for sigma is what?,01:13:23.180,01:13:24.690
"An estimate for sigma, we'll
see methods to do this,",01:13:24.690,01:13:27.150
"but sigma squared
is the variance,",01:13:27.150,01:13:31.360
"or is the expectation, of x
minus expectation of x squared.",01:13:31.360,01:13:35.941
"And the problem is
that I don't know",01:13:38.980,01:13:40.480
what those expectations are.,01:13:40.480,01:13:42.130
"And so I'm going to do what
99.9% percent of statistics is.",01:13:42.130,01:13:47.260
And what is statistics about?,01:13:47.260,01:13:49.710
What's my motto?,01:13:49.710,01:13:51.350
"Statistics is about replacing
expectations with averages.",01:13:51.350,01:13:54.590
"That's what all of
statistics is about.",01:13:54.590,01:13:57.020
"There's 300 pages in a purple
book called All of Statistics",01:13:57.020,01:14:00.740
that tells you this.,01:14:00.740,01:14:01.940
"All right, and then
you do something fancy.",01:14:01.940,01:14:03.740
"Maybe you minimize
something after you",01:14:03.740,01:14:05.570
replace the expectation.,01:14:05.570,01:14:07.100
"Maybe you need to
plug in other stuff.",01:14:07.100,01:14:08.780
"But really, every time
you see an expectation,",01:14:08.780,01:14:10.696
you replace it by an average.,01:14:10.696,01:14:12.110
OK let's do this.,01:14:12.110,01:14:13.470
"So sigma squared
hat will be what?",01:14:13.470,01:14:16.550
"It's going to be 1 over n,
sum from i equals 1 to n",01:14:16.550,01:14:20.420
of xi minus--,01:14:20.420,01:14:22.790
"well, here I need to replace
my expectation by an average,",01:14:22.790,01:14:25.580
which is really this average.,01:14:25.580,01:14:27.230
"I'm going to call
it mu hat squared.",01:14:27.230,01:14:31.600
"There, you have replaced my
expectation with average.",01:14:31.600,01:14:34.310
"OK so the golden thing
is, take your expectation",01:14:34.310,01:14:38.150
and replace it with this.,01:14:38.150,01:14:39.460
"Frame it, get a tattoo, I don't
care but that's what it is.",01:14:45.580,01:14:49.240
"If you remember one thing from
this class, that's what it is.",01:14:49.240,01:14:53.600
"Now you can be fancy, if
you look at your calculator,",01:14:53.600,01:14:56.690
"it's going to put an n
minus 1 here because it",01:14:56.690,01:14:59.660
wants to be unbiased.,01:14:59.660,01:15:00.535
"And those are things we
are going to come to.",01:15:00.535,01:15:02.410
"But let's say right
now we stick to this.",01:15:02.410,01:15:04.400
"And then when I
plug in my numbers.",01:15:04.400,01:15:06.440
"I'm going to get an
estimate for sigma,",01:15:06.440,01:15:14.040
"which is the square
root of the estimator",01:15:14.040,01:15:17.210
once I plug in the numbers.,01:15:17.210,01:15:18.810
"And you can check that the
number, you get will be 18.",01:15:18.810,01:15:21.622
"So those are basic things and
if you've taken any AP stats",01:15:27.410,01:15:31.060
"this should be completely
standard to you.",01:15:31.060,01:15:32.810
"Now I have another list, and
I don't have time to see it.",01:15:35.800,01:15:39.350
It doesn't really matter.,01:15:42.029,01:15:43.070
"OK, we'll do that next time.",01:15:49.264,01:15:50.430
This is fine.,01:15:50.430,01:15:51.200
"We'll see another list
of numbers and see--",01:15:51.200,01:15:55.241
"we're going to think about
modeling assumptions.",01:15:55.241,01:15:57.240
"The goal of this exercise is
not to compute those things,",01:15:57.240,01:15:59.610
"it's really to think about
modeling assumptions.",01:15:59.610,01:16:01.610
"Is it reasonable to think
that things are IID?",01:16:01.610,01:16:04.002
"Is it reasonable
to think that they",01:16:04.002,01:16:05.460
"have all the same parameters,
that they're independent,",01:16:05.460,01:16:07.751
"et cetera,",01:16:07.751,01:16:08.880
"OK so one thing that I wanted
to add is, probably by tonight,",01:16:08.880,01:16:16.850
so I will try to use--,01:16:16.850,01:16:18.810
in the spirit of--,01:16:18.810,01:16:20.625
"I don't know what's
starting to happen.",01:16:20.625,01:16:22.250
"In the spirit of using
my iPad and fancy things,",01:16:22.250,01:16:26.190
"I will try to post some
videos of-- for in particular,",01:16:26.190,01:16:29.250
"who has never used a
statistical table to read, say,",01:16:29.250,01:16:33.840
"the quantiles of a
Gaussian distribution?",01:16:33.840,01:16:37.860
"OK, so there's several of you.",01:16:37.860,01:16:39.480
"This is a simple
but boring exercise.",01:16:39.480,01:16:42.600
"I will just post a
video on how to do this,",01:16:42.600,01:16:44.850
"and you will be able
to find it on Stellar.",01:16:44.850,01:16:46.785
"It's going to take five
minutes, and then you",01:16:46.785,01:16:48.660
"will know everything there
is to know about those things",01:16:48.660,01:16:50.770
"but that's something you need
for the first problem set.",01:16:50.770,01:16:53.154
"By the way, so the
problem set has",01:16:53.154,01:16:54.570
30 exercises in probability.,01:16:54.570,01:16:57.180
You need to do 15.,01:16:57.180,01:16:59.510
And you only need to turn in 15.,01:16:59.510,01:17:01.470
"You can turn in all
of 30 if you want.",01:17:01.470,01:17:03.760
"But you need to know, by the
time we hit those things,",01:17:03.760,01:17:07.230
you need to know--,01:17:07.230,01:17:08.760
"well actually, by next week you
need to know what's in there.",01:17:08.760,01:17:11.370
"So if you don't have time
to do all the homework,",01:17:11.370,01:17:13.970
"and then go back to
your probability class",01:17:13.970,01:17:15.720
"to figure out how to do it,
just do 15 easy that you can do.",01:17:15.720,01:17:19.250
And return those things.,01:17:19.250,01:17:20.250
"But go back to your
probability class",01:17:20.250,01:17:21.827
"and make sure that you
know how to do all of them.",01:17:21.827,01:17:23.910
"Those are pretty
basic questions,",01:17:23.910,01:17:25.650
"and those are things that I'm
not going to slow down on.",01:17:25.650,01:17:28.290
"So you need to remember that
the expectation of the product",01:17:28.290,01:17:30.900
"of independent
random variables is",01:17:30.900,01:17:32.316
a product of the expectations.,01:17:32.316,01:17:34.560
"Expectation of the sum, is
the sum of the expectation.",01:17:34.560,01:17:36.810
"This kind of thing,
which is a little silly,",01:17:36.810,01:17:38.775
"but it just requires
you practice.",01:17:38.775,01:17:40.690
"So, just have fun.",01:17:40.690,01:17:42.150
Those are simple exercises.,01:17:42.150,01:17:43.440
"You will have fun remembering
your probability class.",01:17:43.440,01:17:46.620
"All right, so I'll
see you on Tuesday--",01:17:46.620,01:17:49.620
