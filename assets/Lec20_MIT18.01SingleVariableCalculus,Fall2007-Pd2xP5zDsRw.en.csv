"PROFESSOR: To begin today I want
to remind you, I need to",00:00:22.180,00:00:24.520
"write it down on the board
at least twice, of the",00:00:24.520,00:00:27.720
"fundamental theorem
of calculus.",00:00:27.720,00:00:33.230
"We called it FTC 1 because it's
the first version of the",00:00:33.230,00:00:38.870
fundamental theorem.,00:00:38.870,00:00:39.620
"We'll be talking about another
version, called the second",00:00:39.620,00:00:43.150
"version, today.",00:00:43.150,00:00:44.940
"And what it says is this: If F'
= f, then the integral from",00:00:44.940,00:00:58.010
"a to b of f (x) dx =
F ( b) - F ( a).",00:00:58.010,00:01:06.410
"So that's the fundamental
theorem of calculus.",00:01:06.410,00:01:10.750
"And the way we used it last
time was, this was used to",00:01:10.750,00:01:17.820
evaluate integrals.,00:01:17.820,00:01:22.090
"Not surprisingly, that's
how we used it.",00:01:22.090,00:01:28.110
"But today, I want to reverse
that point of view.",00:01:28.110,00:01:35.670
"We're going to read the equation
backwards, and we're",00:01:35.670,00:01:39.190
going to write it this way.,00:01:39.190,00:01:49.240
"And we're going to use f to
understand capital F. Or in",00:01:49.240,00:02:01.110
"other words, the derivative.",00:02:01.110,00:02:04.370
To understand the function.,00:02:04.370,00:02:07.700
"So that's the reversal
of point of view",00:02:07.700,00:02:11.290
that I'd like to make.,00:02:11.290,00:02:13.380
"And we'll make this point
in various ways.",00:02:13.380,00:02:16.310
"So information about F, about
F', gives us information about",00:02:16.310,00:02:36.460
"F. Now, since there were
questions about the mean value",00:02:36.460,00:02:38.770
"theorem, I'm going to illustrate
this first by",00:02:38.770,00:02:42.040
"making a comparison between
the fundamental theorem of",00:02:42.040,00:02:45.630
"calculus and the mean
value theorem.",00:02:45.630,00:02:50.600
"So we're going to compare this
fundamental theorem of",00:02:50.600,00:02:55.540
"calculus with what we call
the mean value theorem.",00:02:55.540,00:03:01.550
"And in order to do that,
I'm going to",00:03:01.550,00:03:02.980
introduce a couple of notations.,00:03:02.980,00:03:05.070
"I'll write delta F as
F ( b ) - F ( a).",00:03:05.070,00:03:11.820
"And another highly imaginative
notation, delta x = b - a.",00:03:11.820,00:03:17.770
"So here's the change in f,
there's the change in x.",00:03:17.770,00:03:21.760
"And then, this fundamental
theorem can be written, of",00:03:21.760,00:03:27.420
"course, right up above
there is the formula.",00:03:27.420,00:03:30.800
"And it's the formula for delta
F. So this is what we call the",00:03:30.800,00:03:38.110
"fundamental theorem
of calculus.",00:03:38.110,00:03:44.090
"I'm going to divide
by delta x, now.",00:03:44.090,00:03:51.810
"And If I divide by delta x,
that's the same thing as 1 / b",00:03:51.810,00:03:56.690
"- a times the integral from
a to b of f ( x) dx.",00:03:56.690,00:04:02.880
"So I've just rewritten
the formula here.",00:04:02.880,00:04:05.110
"And this expression here, on
the right-hand side, is a",00:04:05.110,00:04:11.960
fairly important one.,00:04:11.960,00:04:13.650
This is the average of f.,00:04:13.650,00:04:23.370
That's the average value of f.,00:04:23.370,00:04:29.490
"Now, so this is going to
permit me to make the",00:04:29.490,00:04:33.610
"comparison between the mean
value theorem, which we don't",00:04:33.610,00:04:37.110
have stated yet here.,00:04:37.110,00:04:38.630
And the fundamental theorem.,00:04:38.630,00:04:41.010
"And I'll do it in the form
of inequalities.",00:04:41.010,00:04:49.130
"So right in the middle here,
I'm going to put the",00:04:49.130,00:04:51.550
fundamental theorem.,00:04:51.550,00:04:52.370
"It says that delta F in this
notation is equal to, well if",00:04:52.370,00:04:57.070
"I multiply by delta x again, I
can write it as the average of",00:04:57.070,00:05:00.650
"F. So I'm going to write it
as the average of F' here.",00:05:00.650,00:05:04.870
Times delta x.,00:05:04.870,00:05:07.100
"So we have this factor here,
which is the average of F', or",00:05:07.100,00:05:10.790
"the average of little f,
it's the same thing.",00:05:10.790,00:05:13.810
"And then I multiplied
through again.",00:05:13.810,00:05:15.430
"So I put the thing
in the red box.",00:05:15.430,00:05:20.810
Here.,00:05:20.810,00:05:29.970
"Isn't what the average
of big F.",00:05:29.970,00:05:37.190
"So the question is, why is this
the average of little f",00:05:37.190,00:05:41.370
"rather than the average of big
F. So the average of a",00:05:41.370,00:05:47.030
function is the typical value.,00:05:47.030,00:05:50.130
"If, for example, little f were
constant, little f were",00:05:50.130,00:05:56.520
"constant, then this integral
would be, so the question is",00:05:56.520,00:06:01.260
why is this the average.,00:06:01.260,00:06:03.920
"And I'll take a little second
to explain that.",00:06:03.920,00:06:08.970
"But I think I'll explain
it over here.",00:06:08.970,00:06:13.050
Because I'm going to erase it.,00:06:13.050,00:06:19.010
"So the idea of an average
is the following.",00:06:19.010,00:06:27.270
"For example, imagine that
a = 0 and b = n,",00:06:27.270,00:06:32.281
let's say for example.,00:06:32.281,00:06:33.600
"And so we might sum the
function from 1 to n.",00:06:33.600,00:06:46.850
"Now, that would be the sum of
the values from 1 to n.",00:06:46.850,00:06:49.520
"But the average is, we
divide by n here.",00:06:49.520,00:06:54.960
So this is the average.,00:06:54.960,00:06:56.140
"And this is a kind of Riemann
sum, representing the integral",00:06:56.140,00:07:01.760
"from 0 to n, of f (x) dx.",00:07:01.760,00:07:06.290
"Where the increment,
delta x, is 1.",00:07:06.290,00:07:10.700
"So this is the notion of
an average value here.",00:07:10.700,00:07:13.470
"But in the continuum setting
as opposed to",00:07:13.470,00:07:15.840
the discrete setting.,00:07:15.840,00:07:20.570
"Whereas what's on the
left-hand side is",00:07:20.570,00:07:24.870
the change in f.,00:07:24.870,00:07:26.840
"The capital F. And this is the
average of the little f.",00:07:26.840,00:07:31.790
So an average is a sum.,00:07:31.790,00:07:33.860
And it's like an integral.,00:07:33.860,00:07:39.520
"So, in other words what I have
here is that the change in f",00:07:39.520,00:07:42.720
"is the average of its
infinitesimal change times the",00:07:42.720,00:07:46.250
"amount of time elapsed,
if you like.",00:07:46.250,00:07:50.000
"So this is the statement of
the fundamental theorem.",00:07:50.000,00:07:56.100
Just rewritten.,00:07:56.100,00:07:56.960
Exactly what I wrote there.,00:07:56.960,00:07:58.450
"But I multiplied back
by delta x.",00:07:58.450,00:08:01.780
"Now, let me compare this with
the mean value theorem.",00:08:01.780,00:08:07.530
"The mean values theorem
also is an equation.",00:08:07.530,00:08:13.590
"The mean value theorem says
that this is equal to",00:08:13.590,00:08:16.420
F' (c) delta x.,00:08:16.420,00:08:21.560
"Now, I pulled a fast
one on you.",00:08:21.560,00:08:23.270
"I used capital F's here to
make the analogy clear.",00:08:23.270,00:08:26.560
"But the role of the letter
is important to make the",00:08:26.560,00:08:30.800
transition to this comparison.,00:08:30.800,00:08:32.200
"We're talking about the function
capital F here.",00:08:32.200,00:08:35.010
And its derivative.,00:08:35.010,00:08:36.620
"Now, this is true.",00:08:36.620,00:08:38.510
"So now I claim that this thing
is fairly specific.",00:08:38.510,00:08:42.510
"Whereas this, unfortunately,
is a little bit vague.",00:08:42.510,00:08:47.750
"And the reason why it's vague is
that c is just somewhere in",00:08:47.750,00:08:51.360
the interval.,00:08:51.360,00:08:52.790
"So some c - sorry, this is some
c, in between a and b.",00:08:52.790,00:09:01.010
"So really, since we don't know
where this thing is, we don't",00:09:01.010,00:09:04.930
"know which of the values it is,
we can't say what it is.",00:09:04.930,00:09:07.690
"All we can do is say well for
sure it's less than the",00:09:07.690,00:09:12.410
largest value.,00:09:12.410,00:09:13.280
"Say, (the maximum
of F' ) delta x.",00:09:13.280,00:09:18.090
"And the only thing we can say
for sure on the other end is",00:09:18.090,00:09:21.010
"that it's less than or equal to
- sorry, it's greater than",00:09:21.010,00:09:24.410
"or equal to, (the minimum
of F' ) delta x.",00:09:24.410,00:09:27.410
Over that same interval.,00:09:27.410,00:09:29.090
"This is over 0 less than
- sorry, a &lt; x &lt; b.",00:09:29.090,00:09:39.650
"So that means that the
fundamental theorem of",00:09:39.650,00:09:42.110
"calculus is a much more
specific thing.",00:09:42.110,00:09:45.950
"And indeed it gives the
same conclusion.",00:09:45.950,00:09:48.460
"It's much stronger than the
mean value theorem.",00:09:48.460,00:09:50.230
"It's way better than the
mean value theorem.",00:09:50.230,00:09:52.330
"In fact, as soon as we have
integrals, we can abandon the",00:09:52.330,00:09:56.410
mean value theorem.,00:09:56.410,00:09:57.280
We don't want it.,00:09:57.280,00:09:58.550
It's too simple-minded.,00:09:58.550,00:10:00.810
"And what we have is something
much more sophisticated, which",00:10:00.810,00:10:03.860
we can use.,00:10:03.860,00:10:04.940
Which is this.,00:10:04.940,00:10:05.760
"So it's obvious that if this is
the average, the average is",00:10:05.760,00:10:08.940
less than the maximum.,00:10:08.940,00:10:09.960
"So it's obvious that it works
just as well to draw this",00:10:09.960,00:10:15.190
conclusion.,00:10:15.190,00:10:15.950
"And similarly over here
with the minimum.",00:10:15.950,00:10:20.010
"OK, the average is always bigger
than the minimum and",00:10:20.010,00:10:22.910
smaller than the max.,00:10:22.910,00:10:25.430
"So this is the connection,
if you like.",00:10:25.430,00:10:28.680
"And I'm going to elaborate
just one step further by",00:10:28.680,00:10:32.660
"talking about the problem that
you had on the exam.",00:10:32.660,00:10:36.340
"So there was an Exam
2 problem.",00:10:36.340,00:10:39.640
"And I'll show you how it works
using the mean value theorem",00:10:39.640,00:10:43.590
"and how it works using
integrals.",00:10:43.590,00:10:45.610
"But I'm going to have to use
this notation capital F. So",00:10:45.610,00:10:48.880
"capital F', as opposed to the
little f, which was what was",00:10:48.880,00:10:52.450
"the notation that was
on your exam.",00:10:52.450,00:10:55.270
So we had this situation here.,00:10:55.270,00:10:57.620
"These were the givens
of the problem.",00:10:57.620,00:11:01.380
"And then the question was, the
mean value theorem says, or",00:11:01.380,00:11:11.870
"implies, if you like,
it doesn't say it,",00:11:11.870,00:11:14.160
but it implies it.,00:11:14.160,00:11:20.110
"Implies a &lt; capital F ( 4)
&lt; b, for which a and b?",00:11:20.110,00:11:38.690
"So let's take a look
at what it says.",00:11:38.690,00:11:43.330
"Well, the mean value theorem
says that F( 4) - F (0) = F' (",00:11:43.330,00:11:53.620
c)( 4 - 0).,00:11:53.620,00:11:57.240
"This is this (F') delta x,
this is the change in x.",00:11:57.240,00:12:03.770
"And that's the same thing
as (1 / 1 + c )( 4).",00:12:03.770,00:12:12.750
"And so the range of values of
this number here is from (1 /",00:12:12.750,00:12:21.060
"1 plus 0)( 4), that's 4.",00:12:21.060,00:12:24.630
"To, that's the largest value, to
the smallest that it gets,",00:12:24.630,00:12:28.000
which is (1 / 1 + 4)( 4).,00:12:28.000,00:12:32.510
That's the range.,00:12:32.510,00:12:41.020
"And so the conclusion is that
F (4) - f ( 0 ) is between,",00:12:41.020,00:12:53.780
"well, let's see.",00:12:53.780,00:12:55.090
It's between 4 and 4/5.,00:12:55.090,00:12:59.040
"Which are those two numbers
down there.",00:12:59.040,00:13:01.850
"And if you remember that F ( 0)
was 1, this is the same as",00:13:01.850,00:13:04.680
"F ( 4), is between 5 and 9/5.",00:13:04.680,00:13:15.680
"So that's the way that you were
supposed to solve the",00:13:15.680,00:13:19.740
problem on the exam.,00:13:19.740,00:13:22.570
"On the other hand, let's compare
to what you would do",00:13:22.570,00:13:26.490
"with the fundamental theorem
of calculus.",00:13:26.490,00:13:31.140
"With the fundamentals theorem
of calculus, we have the",00:13:31.140,00:13:33.680
following formula.,00:13:33.680,00:13:34.900
"F( 4) - F ( 0) = the integral
from 0 to 4 of dx / 1 + x.",00:13:34.900,00:13:46.100
"That's what the fundamental
theorem says.",00:13:46.100,00:13:52.700
"And now I claim that we can
get these same types of",00:13:52.700,00:13:56.920
"results by a very elementary
observation.",00:13:56.920,00:14:00.780
"It's really the same observation
that I made up",00:14:00.780,00:14:02.820
"here, that the average is less
than or equal to the maximum.",00:14:02.820,00:14:06.110
"Which is that the biggest this
can ever be is, let's see.",00:14:06.110,00:14:11.810
"The biggest it is when
x is 0, that's 1.",00:14:11.810,00:14:15.280
"So the biggest it ever
gets is this.",00:14:15.280,00:14:20.360
And that's equal to 4.,00:14:20.360,00:14:25.110
Right?,00:14:25.110,00:14:25.660
"On the other hand, the smallest
it ever gets to be,",00:14:25.660,00:14:30.910
it's equal to this.,00:14:30.910,00:14:36.770
"The smallest it ever gets to
be is the integral from",00:14:36.770,00:14:39.800
0 to 4 of 1/5 dx.,00:14:39.800,00:14:42.400
"Because that's the
lowest value that",00:14:42.400,00:14:44.220
the integrand takes.,00:14:44.220,00:14:46.110
"When x = 4, it's 1/5.",00:14:46.110,00:14:48.390
And that's equal to 4/5.,00:14:48.390,00:14:54.270
"Now, there's a little tiny
detail which is that really we",00:14:54.270,00:14:57.720
"know that this is the area of
some rectangle and this is",00:14:57.720,00:15:00.390
strictly smaller.,00:15:00.390,00:15:01.560
"And we know that these
inequalities",00:15:01.560,00:15:03.520
are actually strict.,00:15:03.520,00:15:05.210
But that's a minor point.,00:15:05.210,00:15:07.620
"And certainly not one that we'll
pay close attention to.",00:15:07.620,00:15:12.270
"But now, let me show you what
this looks like geometrically.",00:15:12.270,00:15:17.910
"So geometrically, we interpret
this as the",00:15:17.910,00:15:19.700
area under a curve.,00:15:19.700,00:15:22.270
"Here's a piece of the
curve y = 1/1 + x.",00:15:22.270,00:15:31.850
"And it's going up to 4 and
starting at 0 here.",00:15:31.850,00:15:37.130
"And the first estimate that we
made; that is, the upper",00:15:37.130,00:15:42.570
"bound, was by trapping this in
this big rectangle here.",00:15:42.570,00:15:53.200
"We compared it to the constant
function, which was 1 all the",00:15:53.200,00:15:56.640
way across.,00:15:56.640,00:15:57.990
This is y = 1.,00:15:57.990,00:16:00.300
"And then we also trapped it
from underneath by the",00:16:00.300,00:16:06.060
"function which was
at the bottom.",00:16:06.060,00:16:08.600
And this was y = 1/5.,00:16:08.600,00:16:14.430
"And so what this really is is,
these things are the simplest",00:16:14.430,00:16:19.980
possible Riemann sum.,00:16:19.980,00:16:21.060
Sort of a silly Riemann sum.,00:16:21.060,00:16:22.860
"This is a Riemann sum
with one rectangle.",00:16:22.860,00:16:34.390
"This is the simplest
possible one.",00:16:34.390,00:16:36.420
"And so this is a very,
very crude estimate.",00:16:36.420,00:16:38.580
"You can see it misses
by a mile.",00:16:38.580,00:16:40.970
"The larger and the smaller
values are off",00:16:40.970,00:16:43.180
by a factor of 5.,00:16:43.180,00:16:46.370
"But this one is called
the, this one is the",00:16:46.370,00:16:49.480
lower Riemann sum.,00:16:49.480,00:16:53.390
"And that one is less than
our actual integral.",00:16:53.390,00:16:59.560
"Which is less than the
upper Riemann sum.",00:16:59.560,00:17:14.100
"And you should, by now, have
looked at those upper and",00:17:14.100,00:17:18.740
lower sums on your homework.,00:17:18.740,00:17:20.670
"So it's just the rectangles
underneath and the",00:17:20.670,00:17:22.630
rectangles on top.,00:17:22.630,00:17:25.390
"So at this point, we can
literally abandon the mean",00:17:25.390,00:17:28.150
value theorem.,00:17:28.150,00:17:28.730
"Because we have a much better
way of getting at things.",00:17:28.730,00:17:30.930
"If we chop things up into more
rectangles, we'll get much",00:17:30.930,00:17:33.330
"better numerical
approximations.",00:17:33.330,00:17:35.550
"And if we use simpleminded
expressions with integrals,",00:17:35.550,00:17:38.640
"we'll be able to figure out any
bound we could get using",00:17:38.640,00:17:40.940
the mean value theorem.,00:17:40.940,00:17:42.610
"So that's not the relevance
of the mean value theorem.",00:17:42.610,00:17:45.790
"I'll explain to you why we
talked about it, even, in a",00:17:45.790,00:17:49.070
few minutes.,00:17:49.070,00:17:51.310
"OK, are there any questions
before we go on?",00:17:51.310,00:18:00.040
Yeah.,00:18:00.040,00:18:00.290
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:18:00.290,00:18:07.000
"PROFESSOR: I knew that the range
of c was from 0 to 4, I",00:18:07.000,00:18:09.910
"should have said that
right here.",00:18:09.910,00:18:11.980
This is true for this theorem.,00:18:11.980,00:18:13.715
"The mean value theorem
comes with an extra",00:18:13.715,00:18:16.190
"statement, which I missed.",00:18:16.190,00:18:17.950
"Which is that this is for
some c between 0 and 4.",00:18:17.950,00:18:21.960
"So I know the range is
between 0 and 4.",00:18:21.960,00:18:23.690
"The reason why it's between 0
and 4 is that 's part of the",00:18:23.690,00:18:25.690
mean value theorem.,00:18:25.690,00:18:27.560
"We started at 0,
we ended at 4.",00:18:27.560,00:18:29.610
"So the c has to be somewhere
in between.",00:18:29.610,00:18:32.420
"That's part of the mean
value theorem.",00:18:32.420,00:18:42.240
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:18:42.240,00:18:42.890
"PROFESSOR: The question is, do
you exclude any values that",00:18:42.890,00:18:44.600
are above 4 and below 0.,00:18:44.600,00:18:45.820
"Yes, absolutely.",00:18:45.820,00:18:47.210
"The point is that in order to
figure out how F changes,",00:18:47.210,00:18:49.860
"capital F changes, between 0
and 4, you need only pay",00:18:49.860,00:18:52.760
"attention to the values
in between.",00:18:52.760,00:18:54.150
"You don't have to pay any
attention to what the function",00:18:54.150,00:18:56.210
is doing below 0 or above 4.,00:18:56.210,00:18:59.740
"Those things are strictly
irrelevant.",00:18:59.740,00:19:07.090
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:19:07.090,00:19:16.780
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, I mean
it's strictly in",00:19:16.780,00:19:18.270
between these two numbers.,00:19:18.270,00:19:19.950
"I have to understand what the
lowest and the highest one is.",00:19:19.950,00:19:23.420
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:19:23.420,00:19:24.700
"PROFESSOR: It's approaching
that, so.",00:19:24.700,00:19:35.200
OK.,00:19:35.200,00:19:35.530
"So now, the next thing that
we're going to talk about is,",00:19:35.530,00:19:40.050
"since I've got that 1 up
there, that Fundamental",00:19:40.050,00:19:42.400
"Theorem of Calculus 1, I need
to talk about version 2.",00:19:42.400,00:20:05.070
"So here is the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus version 2.",00:20:05.070,00:20:15.530
"I'm going to start out with a
function little f, and I'm",00:20:15.530,00:20:20.900
"going to assume that
it's continuous.",00:20:20.900,00:20:28.200
"And then I'm going to define a
new function, which is defined",00:20:28.200,00:20:30.690
as a definite integral.,00:20:30.690,00:20:32.790
"G ( x ) is the integral from
a to x of f ( t ) dt.",00:20:32.790,00:20:40.310
"Now, I want to emphasize here
because it's the first time",00:20:40.310,00:20:42.840
"that I'm writing something
like this, that this is a",00:20:42.840,00:20:44.830
fairly complicated gadget.,00:20:44.830,00:20:47.300
"It plays a very basic and very
fundamental, but simple role",00:20:47.300,00:20:52.110
"but it nevertheless is
a little complicated.",00:20:52.110,00:20:54.490
"What's happening here is that
the upper limit I've now",00:20:54.490,00:20:58.370
"called x, and the variable t
is ranging between a and x,",00:20:58.370,00:21:05.840
"and that the a and the
x are fixed when I",00:21:05.840,00:21:08.250
calculate the integral.,00:21:08.250,00:21:12.290
"And the t is what's called
the dummy variable.",00:21:12.290,00:21:14.730
"It's the variable
of integration.",00:21:14.730,00:21:16.290
"You'll see a lot of people who
will mix this x with this t.",00:21:16.290,00:21:21.420
"And if you do that, you will
get confused, potentially",00:21:21.420,00:21:25.790
"hopelessly confused,
in this class.",00:21:25.790,00:21:28.150
In 18.02 you will be completely,00:21:28.150,00:21:30.380
lost if you do that.,00:21:30.380,00:21:32.310
So don't do it.,00:21:32.310,00:21:33.720
Don't mix these two guys up.,00:21:33.720,00:21:38.410
"It's actually done by many
people in textbooks, and it's",00:21:38.410,00:21:42.510
fairly careless.,00:21:42.510,00:21:43.130
"Especially in old-fashioned
textbooks.",00:21:43.130,00:21:45.230
But don't do it.,00:21:45.230,00:21:48.610
So here we have this G ( x).,00:21:48.610,00:21:50.570
"Now, remember, this G ( x)
really does make sense.",00:21:50.570,00:21:56.250
"If you give me an a, and you
give me an x, I can figure out",00:21:56.250,00:22:00.490
"what this is, because I can
figure out the Riemann sum.",00:22:00.490,00:22:02.830
"So of course I need to know
what the function is, too.",00:22:02.830,00:22:05.090
"But anyway, we have a numerical
procedure for",00:22:05.090,00:22:07.370
"figuring out what the
function g is.",00:22:07.370,00:22:09.920
"Now, as is suggested by this
mysterious letter x being in",00:22:09.920,00:22:13.090
"the place where it is, I'm
actually going to vary x.",00:22:13.090,00:22:16.350
"So the conclusion is that if
this is true, and this is just",00:22:16.350,00:22:20.000
"a parenthesism not part
of the theorem.",00:22:20.000,00:22:21.870
"It's just an indication of
what the notation means.",00:22:21.870,00:22:25.770
Then G' = f.,00:22:25.770,00:22:40.430
"Let me first explain what the
significance of this theorem",00:22:40.430,00:22:43.030
"is, from the point of view of
differential equations.",00:22:43.030,00:22:47.830
"G ( x) solves the differential
equation y' = f ( x).",00:22:47.830,00:23:04.420
"So y' = f, you put the x in
if I got it here, with the",00:23:04.420,00:23:09.960
condition y ( a) = 0.,00:23:09.960,00:23:13.240
"So it solves this pair
of conditions here.",00:23:13.240,00:23:19.000
"The rate of change, and
the initial position",00:23:19.000,00:23:21.860
is specified here.,00:23:21.860,00:23:23.280
"Because when you integrate from
a to a, you get 0 always.",00:23:23.280,00:23:29.660
"And what this theorem
says is you can",00:23:29.660,00:23:33.660
always solve that equation.,00:23:33.660,00:23:35.700
When we did differential,00:23:35.700,00:23:36.670
"equations, I said that already.",00:23:36.670,00:23:38.130
"I said we'll treat these
as always solved.",00:23:38.130,00:23:39.990
"Well, here's the reason.",00:23:39.990,00:23:41.530
"We have a numerical
procedure for",00:23:41.530,00:23:43.160
computing things like this.,00:23:43.160,00:23:45.080
"We could always solve
this equation.",00:23:45.080,00:23:49.330
"And the formula is a fairly
complicated gadget, but so far",00:23:49.330,00:23:54.530
"just associated with
Riemann sums.",00:23:54.530,00:23:58.400
"Alright, now.",00:23:58.400,00:24:01.000
Let's just do one example.,00:24:01.000,00:24:13.820
"Unfortunately, not a complicated
example and maybe",00:24:13.820,00:24:17.610
"not persuasive as to
why you would care",00:24:17.610,00:24:19.580
about this just yet.,00:24:19.580,00:24:21.230
"But nevertheless
very important.",00:24:21.230,00:24:23.670
"Because this is the quiz
question which everybody gets",00:24:23.670,00:24:26.470
wrong until they practice it.,00:24:26.470,00:24:29.530
"So the integral from, say
1 to x of dt / t ^2.",00:24:29.530,00:24:38.710
Let's try this one here.,00:24:38.710,00:24:45.420
"So here's an example of
this theorem, I claim.",00:24:45.420,00:24:56.650
"Now, this is a question which
challenges your ability to",00:24:56.650,00:25:01.020
"understand what the
question means.",00:25:01.020,00:25:04.740
"Because it's got a
lot of symbols.",00:25:04.740,00:25:06.800
"It's got the integration and
it's got the differentiation.",00:25:06.800,00:25:09.730
"However, what it really is
an exercise in recopying.",00:25:09.730,00:25:15.700
"You look at it and you write
down the answer.",00:25:15.700,00:25:20.660
"And the reason is that, by
definition, this function in",00:25:20.660,00:25:25.720
"here is a function of the
form G ( x) of the",00:25:25.720,00:25:30.740
theorem over here.,00:25:30.740,00:25:34.320
So this is the G ( x).,00:25:34.320,00:25:35.920
"And by definition, we said
that G' ( x) = f(x).",00:25:35.920,00:25:42.980
"Well, what's the f ( x)?",00:25:42.980,00:25:46.170
Look inside here.,00:25:46.170,00:25:47.010
"It's what's called
the integrand.",00:25:47.010,00:25:48.760
"This is the integral from 0
to x of f ( t ) dt, right?",00:25:48.760,00:25:53.640
Where f ( t) = 1 / t^2.,00:25:53.640,00:26:00.710
So your ability is challenged.,00:26:00.710,00:26:02.910
"You have to take that 1 / t ^2
and you have to plug in the",00:26:02.910,00:26:06.430
"letter x, instead of t for it.",00:26:06.430,00:26:09.960
And then write it down.,00:26:09.960,00:26:11.480
"As I say, this is an exercise
in recopying what's there.",00:26:11.480,00:26:18.120
"So this is quite easy
to do, right?",00:26:18.120,00:26:19.970
"I mean, you just look and
you write it down.",00:26:19.970,00:26:21.750
"But nevertheless, it
looks like a long,",00:26:21.750,00:26:25.490
elaborate object here.,00:26:25.490,00:26:28.350
Pardon me?,00:26:28.350,00:26:28.760
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:26:28.760,00:26:30.590
"PROFESSOR: So the question
was, why did I integrate.",00:26:30.590,00:26:32.940
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:26:32.940,00:26:34.000
"PROFESSOR: Why did
I not integrate?",00:26:34.000,00:26:36.990
Ah.,00:26:36.990,00:26:37.720
Very good question.,00:26:37.720,00:26:38.870
Why did I not integrate.,00:26:38.870,00:26:41.010
"The reason why I didn't
integrate is I didn't need to.",00:26:41.010,00:26:45.300
"Just as when you take the -
sorry, the derivative of",00:26:45.300,00:26:48.890
"something, you take the
antiderivative, you get back",00:26:48.890,00:26:50.610
to the thing.,00:26:50.610,00:26:51.750
"So, in this case, we're taking
the antiderivative of",00:26:51.750,00:26:54.650
"something and we're
differentiating.",00:26:54.650,00:26:56.030
"So we end back in the same
place where we started.",00:26:56.030,00:26:58.380
"We started with f ( t),
we're ending with f.",00:26:58.380,00:27:01.780
Little f.,00:27:01.780,00:27:04.990
"So you integrate, and
then differentiate.",00:27:04.990,00:27:06.950
"And you get back to
the same place.",00:27:06.950,00:27:09.410
"Now, the only difference between
this and the other",00:27:09.410,00:27:11.960
"version is, in this case when
you differentiate and",00:27:11.960,00:27:14.880
"integrate you could be
off by a constant.",00:27:14.880,00:27:18.430
"That's what that shift,
why there are two",00:27:18.430,00:27:19.910
pieces to this one.,00:27:19.910,00:27:21.420
"But there's never an
extra piece here.",00:27:21.420,00:27:23.020
There's no + c here.,00:27:23.020,00:27:25.060
"When you integrate and
differentiate, you kill",00:27:25.060,00:27:26.890
whatever the constant is.,00:27:26.890,00:27:28.080
"Because the derivative
of a constant is 0.",00:27:28.080,00:27:31.920
"So no matter what the constant
is hiding inside of g, you're",00:27:31.920,00:27:36.430
getting the same result.,00:27:36.430,00:27:37.710
So this is the basic idea.,00:27:37.710,00:27:41.140
"Now, I just want to double-check
it, using the",00:27:41.140,00:27:47.450
"Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus 1 here.",00:27:47.450,00:27:52.170
"So let's actually evaluate
the integral.",00:27:52.170,00:27:53.790
"So now I'm going to do what
you've suggested, which is I'm",00:27:53.790,00:27:55.820
"just going to check
whether it's true.",00:27:55.820,00:27:57.370
"No, no I am because I'm going
just double-check that it's",00:27:57.370,00:27:59.890
consistent.,00:27:59.890,00:28:01.120
"It certainly is slower this way,
and we're not going to",00:28:01.120,00:28:03.930
"want to do this all the
time, but we might",00:28:03.930,00:28:05.390
as well check one.,00:28:05.390,00:28:06.810
So this is our integral.,00:28:06.810,00:28:09.370
And we know how to do it.,00:28:09.370,00:28:10.860
"No, I need to do it.",00:28:10.860,00:28:13.260
"And this is - t ^ - 1,
evaluated at 1 and x.",00:28:13.260,00:28:17.820
"Again, there's something
subliminally here for you to",00:28:17.820,00:28:22.480
think about.,00:28:22.480,00:28:23.300
"Which is that, remember,
its t is ranging",00:28:23.300,00:28:25.980
between 1 and t = x.,00:28:25.980,00:28:28.840
"And this is one of the big
reasons why this letter t has",00:28:28.840,00:28:31.280
to be different from x.,00:28:31.280,00:28:32.860
"Because here it's 1
and there it's x.",00:28:32.860,00:28:35.370
It's not x.,00:28:35.370,00:28:37.210
So you can't put an x here.,00:28:37.210,00:28:38.890
"Again, this is t = 1 and this
is t = x over there.",00:28:38.890,00:28:44.130
"And now if I plug that
in, I get what?",00:28:44.130,00:28:48.630
"I get - 1 / x, and then
I get - ( - 1).",00:28:48.630,00:28:55.860
"So this is, let me get rid of
those little t's there.",00:28:55.860,00:28:59.090
"This is a little
easier to read.",00:28:59.090,00:29:05.690
And so now let's check it.,00:29:05.690,00:29:07.030
It's d / dx.,00:29:07.030,00:29:07.730
So here's what G ( x) is.,00:29:07.730,00:29:09.280
G ( x) = 1 - 1 / x.,00:29:09.280,00:29:12.260
That's what G( x) is.,00:29:12.260,00:29:14.860
"And if I differentiate that,
I get + 1 / x ^2.",00:29:14.860,00:29:20.500
That's it.,00:29:20.500,00:29:26.170
"You see the constant
washed away.",00:29:26.170,00:29:40.810
"So now, here's my job.",00:29:40.810,00:29:42.070
"My job is to prove these
theorems. I never did prove",00:29:42.070,00:29:45.330
them for you.,00:29:45.330,00:29:46.140
"So, I'm going to prove the",00:29:46.140,00:29:47.210
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.,00:29:47.210,00:29:49.340
"But I'm going to do 2 first.
And then I'm going to do 1.",00:29:49.340,00:29:53.420
"And it's just going to take
me just one blackboard.",00:29:53.420,00:29:56.490
It's not that hard.,00:29:56.490,00:30:00.310
The proof is by picture.,00:30:00.310,00:30:03.150
"And, using the interpretation
as area under the curve.",00:30:03.150,00:30:08.310
"So if here's the value of a, and
this is the graph of the",00:30:08.310,00:30:13.650
function y equals f of x.,00:30:13.650,00:30:22.550
"Then I want to draw three
vertical lines.",00:30:22.550,00:30:26.380
"One of them is going
to be at x.",00:30:26.380,00:30:29.330
"And one of them is going
to be at x + delta x.",00:30:29.330,00:30:33.790
"So here I have the interval from
0 to x, and next I have",00:30:33.790,00:30:37.390
"the interval from x to delta
x more than that.",00:30:37.390,00:30:42.900
"And now the pieces that I've got
are the area of this part.",00:30:42.900,00:30:50.360
"So this has area which
has a name.",00:30:50.360,00:30:53.430
It's called G ( x ).,00:30:53.430,00:30:55.860
"By definition, G( x ), which is
sitting right over here in",00:30:55.860,00:31:00.900
"the fundamental theorem, is the
integral from a to x of",00:31:00.900,00:31:05.500
this function.,00:31:05.500,00:31:06.100
"So it's the area under
the curve.",00:31:06.100,00:31:07.890
So that area is G ( x ).,00:31:07.890,00:31:10.400
"Now this other chunk here, I
claim that this is delta G.",00:31:10.400,00:31:21.700
"This is the change in G. It's
the value of G ( x ) that is",00:31:21.700,00:31:24.980
"the area of the whole business
all the way up to x + delta x",00:31:24.980,00:31:27.930
"- the first part, G ( x ).",00:31:27.930,00:31:30.530
So it's what's left over.,00:31:30.530,00:31:31.640
"It's the incremental amount
of area there.",00:31:31.640,00:31:39.780
"And now I am going to carry
out a pretty standard",00:31:39.780,00:31:45.100
estimation here.,00:31:45.100,00:31:46.520
"This is practically
a rectangle.",00:31:46.520,00:31:48.850
"And it's got a base of delta
x, and so we need to figure",00:31:48.850,00:31:51.590
out what its height is.,00:31:51.590,00:31:55.320
"This is delta G, and it's
approximately its base times",00:31:55.320,00:32:02.450
its height.,00:32:02.450,00:32:05.340
But what is the height?,00:32:05.340,00:32:06.820
"Well, the height is maybe either
this segment or this",00:32:06.820,00:32:10.390
"segment or something
in between.",00:32:10.390,00:32:11.920
"But they're all about
the same.",00:32:11.920,00:32:13.720
"So I'm just going to put in the
value at the first point.",00:32:13.720,00:32:17.070
That's the left end there.,00:32:17.070,00:32:19.430
"So that's this height
here, is f ( x ).",00:32:19.430,00:32:25.550
"So this is f (x), and so really
I approximate it by",00:32:25.550,00:32:28.330
that rectangle there.,00:32:28.330,00:32:30.050
"And now if I divide and take the
limit, as delta x goes to",00:32:30.050,00:32:34.790
"0 of delta G / delta x, it's
going to equal f ( x ).",00:32:34.790,00:32:43.120
"And this is where I'm using the
fact that f is continuous.",00:32:43.120,00:32:48.920
"Because I need the values nearby
to be similar to the",00:32:48.920,00:32:51.960
value in the limit.,00:32:51.960,00:32:59.690
"OK, that's the end.",00:32:59.690,00:33:00.650
"This the end of the proof, so
I'll put a nice little q.e.d.",00:33:00.650,00:33:05.020
here.,00:33:05.020,00:33:10.800
"So we've done Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus 2, and now",00:33:10.800,00:33:14.750
"we're ready for Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus 1.",00:33:14.750,00:33:38.420
"So now I still have it on the
blackboard to remind you.",00:33:38.420,00:33:44.580
"It says that the integral
of the derivative is the",00:33:44.580,00:33:48.690
"function, at least the
difference between the values",00:33:48.690,00:33:50.980
of the function at two places.,00:33:50.980,00:33:54.830
"So the place where we
start is with this",00:33:54.830,00:34:04.300
property that F' = f.,00:34:04.300,00:34:08.040
"That's the starting, that's
the hypothesis.",00:34:08.040,00:34:10.600
"Now, unfortunately, I'm going
to have to assume something",00:34:10.600,00:34:13.770
"extra in order to use the
Fundamental Theorem of",00:34:13.770,00:34:17.730
"Calculus 2, which is I'm going
to assume that f is",00:34:17.730,00:34:24.410
continuous.,00:34:24.410,00:34:27.980
"That's not really necessary, but
that's just a very minor",00:34:27.980,00:34:31.380
"technical point, which I'm
just going to ignore.",00:34:31.380,00:34:34.280
"So we're going to start
with F' = f.",00:34:34.280,00:34:40.610
"And then I'm going to
go somewhere else.",00:34:40.610,00:34:46.530
"I'm going to define a new
function, G (x), which is the",00:34:46.530,00:34:53.580
"integral from a to
x of f ( t ) dt.",00:34:53.580,00:35:00.130
"This is where we needed all of
the labor of Riemann's sums.",00:35:00.130,00:35:04.560
"Because otherwise we don't have
a way of making sense out",00:35:04.560,00:35:07.170
of what this even means.,00:35:07.170,00:35:10.340
"So hiding behind this one
sentence is the fact that we",00:35:10.340,00:35:14.690
actually have a number.,00:35:14.690,00:35:16.050
"We have a formula for
such functions.",00:35:16.050,00:35:18.430
"So there is a function g (x)
which, once you've produced a",00:35:18.430,00:35:21.450
"little f for me, I can cook up
a function capital G for you.",00:35:21.450,00:35:27.420
"Now, we're going to apply this
Fundamental Theorem of",00:35:27.420,00:35:30.860
"Calculus 2, the one that
we've already checked.",00:35:30.860,00:35:34.650
So what does it say?,00:35:34.650,00:35:36.030
It says that G' = f.,00:35:36.030,00:35:46.510
"And so now we're in the
following situation.",00:35:46.510,00:35:49.820
"We know that F' (
x ) = G' ( x).",00:35:49.820,00:35:58.080
That's what we've got so far.,00:35:58.080,00:36:00.360
"And now we have one last step
to get a good connection",00:36:00.360,00:36:06.650
"between F and G. Which is that
we can conclude that F ( x ) =",00:36:06.650,00:36:10.380
G ( x) + c.,00:36:10.380,00:36:12.170
"Now, this little step may seem
innocuous but I remind you",00:36:20.440,00:36:28.730
"that this is the spot
that requires",00:36:28.730,00:36:32.610
the mean value theorem.,00:36:32.610,00:36:36.030
"So in order not too lie to you,
we actually tell you what",00:36:36.030,00:36:40.220
"the underpinnings of all
of calculus are.",00:36:40.220,00:36:42.680
"And they're this: the fact,
if you like, that if two",00:36:42.680,00:36:45.720
"functions have the
same derivative,",00:36:45.720,00:36:47.110
they differ by a constant.,00:36:47.110,00:36:48.430
"Or that if a function
has derivative 0,",00:36:48.430,00:36:50.750
it's a constant itself.,00:36:50.750,00:36:53.960
"Now, that is the fundamental
step that's needed, the",00:36:53.960,00:36:58.110
underlying step that's needed.,00:36:58.110,00:36:59.740
"And, unfortunately, there aren't
any proofs of it that",00:36:59.740,00:37:02.630
"are less complicated than using
the mean value theorem.",00:37:02.630,00:37:06.050
"And so that's why we talk a
little bit about the mean",00:37:06.050,00:37:08.190
"value theorem, because we don't
want to lie to you about",00:37:08.190,00:37:10.630
what's really going on.,00:37:10.630,00:37:11.780
Yes.,00:37:11.780,00:37:12.230
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:37:12.230,00:37:19.070
"PROFESSOR: The question is how
did I get from here, to here.",00:37:19.070,00:37:24.210
"And the answer is that if G' is
little f, and we also know",00:37:24.210,00:37:28.160
"that F' is little f,
then F' is G'.",00:37:28.160,00:37:32.950
OK.,00:37:32.950,00:37:37.090
Other questions?,00:37:37.090,00:37:50.710
"Alright, so we're almost done.",00:37:50.710,00:37:52.750
"I just have to work out
the arithmetic here.",00:37:52.750,00:37:57.400
So I start with F(b) - F ( a).,00:37:57.400,00:38:04.810
"And that's equal to (G (
b) + c) - (G (a) + c).",00:38:04.810,00:38:18.130
And then I cancel the c's.,00:38:18.130,00:38:20.970
So I have here G(b) - G(a).,00:38:20.970,00:38:23.310
"And now I just have to check
what each of these is.",00:38:29.960,00:38:32.665
"So Remember the definition
of G here.",00:38:32.665,00:38:35.090
G ( b) is just what we want.,00:38:35.090,00:38:38.100
"The integral from a
to b of f(x) dx.",00:38:38.100,00:38:42.460
"Well I called it f ( t) dt,
that's the same as f(x) dx",00:38:42.460,00:38:46.430
"now, because I have the limit
being b and I'm allowed to use",00:38:46.430,00:38:49.900
x as the dummy variable.,00:38:49.900,00:38:52.900
"Now the other one,
I claim, is 0.",00:38:52.900,00:38:55.780
"Because it's the integral
from a to a.",00:38:55.780,00:38:59.680
"This one is the integral
from a to a.",00:38:59.680,00:39:03.490
Which gives us 0.,00:39:03.490,00:39:06.510
"So this is just this - 0,
and that's the end.",00:39:06.510,00:39:09.370
That's it.,00:39:09.370,00:39:13.460
"I started with F( b) - F( a),
I got to the integral.",00:39:13.460,00:39:20.370
Question?,00:39:20.370,00:39:20.770
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:20.770,00:39:27.370
"PROFESSOR: How did I get from
F ( b) - F (a), is (G ( b) +",00:39:27.370,00:39:32.070
"c) - (G( a) + c), that's
the question.",00:39:32.070,00:39:35.430
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:35.430,00:39:40.190
"PROFESSOR: Oh, sorry this
is an equals sign.",00:39:40.190,00:39:44.160
"Sorry, the second line
didn't draw.",00:39:44.160,00:39:47.090
"OK, equals.",00:39:47.090,00:39:48.640
"Because we're plugging in for
f (x) the formula for it.",00:39:48.640,00:39:53.240
Yes.,00:39:53.240,00:39:53.640
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:53.640,00:39:57.310
PROFESSOR: This step here?,00:39:57.310,00:39:59.630
Or this one? there's,00:39:59.630,00:40:04.730
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:40:04.730,00:40:09.520
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:40:09.520,00:40:10.100
So that was a good question.,00:40:10.100,00:40:12.090
"But the answer is that that's
the statement that we're",00:40:12.090,00:40:15.540
aiming for.,00:40:15.540,00:40:16.300
"That's the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus 1, which",00:40:16.300,00:40:18.280
we don't know yet.,00:40:18.280,00:40:19.950
"So we're trying to prove it, and
that's why we haven't, we",00:40:19.950,00:40:22.030
can't assume it.,00:40:22.030,00:40:25.950
"OK, so let me just notice that
in the example that we had,",00:40:25.950,00:40:33.270
"before we go on to something
else here.",00:40:33.270,00:40:36.410
"In the example above, what we
had was the following thing.",00:40:36.410,00:40:48.530
"We had, say, F (
x ) = - 1 / x.",00:40:48.530,00:40:58.070
So F' (x) = 1 / x ^2.,00:40:58.070,00:41:01.890
"And, say, G ( x)
= 1 - (1 / x).",00:41:01.890,00:41:08.850
"And you can see that either
way you do that, if you",00:41:08.850,00:41:12.220
"integrate from 1 to 2, let's
say, which is what we had over",00:41:12.220,00:41:15.260
"there, dt / t ^2, you're going
to get either - 1 / t, 1 to 2",00:41:15.260,00:41:26.160
"or, if you like, 1 -
(1 / t), 1 to 2.",00:41:26.160,00:41:31.200
"So this is the F version,
this is the G version.",00:41:31.200,00:41:33.930
"And that's what plays
itself out here, in",00:41:33.930,00:41:36.750
this general proof.,00:41:36.750,00:41:45.410
Alright.,00:41:45.410,00:41:49.640
"So now I want to go back to the
theme for today, which is",00:41:49.640,00:41:55.560
"using little f to understand
capital F. In other words,",00:41:55.560,00:42:01.290
"using the derivative of f to
understand capital F. And I",00:42:01.290,00:42:06.490
"want to illustrate it by some
more complicated examples.",00:42:06.490,00:42:22.630
"So I guess I just erased it,
but we just took the",00:42:22.630,00:42:26.980
antiderivative of 1 / t ^2.,00:42:26.980,00:42:29.740
"And there's all of the
powers work easily.",00:42:29.740,00:42:32.320
"But one, and the tricky one
is the power 1 / x.",00:42:32.320,00:42:39.190
"So let's consider the
differential equation",00:42:39.190,00:42:41.060
L' ( x) = 1 / x.,00:42:41.060,00:42:44.550
"And say, with the initial
value L (1) = 0.",00:42:44.550,00:42:54.490
"The solution, so the Fundamental
Theorem of",00:42:54.490,00:42:56.250
"Calculus 2 tells us
the solution is",00:42:56.250,00:43:05.870
this function here.,00:43:05.870,00:43:07.330
"L( x) equals the integral
from 1 to x, dt / t.",00:43:07.330,00:43:14.070
"That's how we solve all
such equations.",00:43:14.070,00:43:16.490
"We just integrate, take
the definite integral.",00:43:16.490,00:43:19.290
"And I'm starting at 1 because
I insisted that L( 1 ) be 0.",00:43:19.290,00:43:27.400
"So that's the solution
to the problem.",00:43:27.400,00:43:31.100
"And now the thing that's
interesting here is that we",00:43:31.100,00:43:34.370
started from a polynomial.,00:43:34.370,00:43:35.720
"Or we started from a rational,
a ratio of polynomials; that",00:43:35.720,00:43:38.060
"is, 1 / t or 1 / x.",00:43:38.060,00:43:40.460
"And we get to a function which
is actually what's known as a",00:43:40.460,00:43:43.180
transcendental function.,00:43:43.180,00:43:44.990
"It's not an algebraic
function.",00:43:44.990,00:43:46.460
"Yeah, question.",00:43:46.460,00:43:47.080
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:43:47.080,00:43:57.000
"PROFESSOR: The question is why
is this equal to that.",00:43:57.000,00:44:04.970
"And the answer is, it's for the
same reason that this is",00:44:04.970,00:44:09.460
equal to that.,00:44:09.460,00:44:10.200
It's the same reason as this.,00:44:10.200,00:44:14.030
It's that the 1's cancel.,00:44:14.030,00:44:16.760
"We're taken the value of
something at 2 minus",00:44:16.760,00:44:19.410
the value at 1.,00:44:19.410,00:44:20.300
"The value at 2 minus
the value at 1.",00:44:20.300,00:44:22.500
"And you'll get a 1 in the one
case, and you get a 1 in the",00:44:22.500,00:44:25.150
other case.,00:44:25.150,00:44:25.470
"And you subtract them and
they will cancel.",00:44:25.470,00:44:27.580
They'll give you 0.,00:44:27.580,00:44:28.620
"These two things really
are equal.",00:44:28.620,00:44:31.380
"This is not a function evaluated
at one place, it's",00:44:31.380,00:44:33.870
"the difference between the
function evaluated at 2 and",00:44:33.870,00:44:36.100
the value at 1.,00:44:36.100,00:44:37.025
"And whenever you subtract
two things like that,",00:44:37.025,00:44:39.570
constants drop out.,00:44:39.570,00:44:40.900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:44:40.900,00:44:43.960
PROFESSOR: That's right.,00:44:43.960,00:44:44.370
"If I put 2, here if I
put c here, it would",00:44:44.370,00:44:46.300
have been the same.,00:44:46.300,00:44:47.370
"It would just have
dropped out.",00:44:47.370,00:44:49.010
It's not there.,00:44:49.010,00:44:50.640
"And that's exactly this
arithmetic right here.",00:44:50.640,00:44:53.260
"It doesn't matter which
antiderivative you take.",00:44:53.260,00:44:55.520
"When you take the differences,
the c's will cancel.",00:44:55.520,00:44:57.850
"You always get the same
answer in the end.",00:44:57.850,00:45:03.130
"That's exactly why I wrote
this down, so that",00:45:03.130,00:45:05.140
you would see that.,00:45:05.140,00:45:06.290
"It doesn't matter which
one you do.",00:45:06.290,00:45:12.890
"So, we still have a couple
of minutes left here.",00:45:12.890,00:45:21.540
"This is actually, so
let me go back.",00:45:21.540,00:45:23.630
"So here's the antiderivative of
1 / x, with value 1 at 0.",00:45:23.630,00:45:29.720
"Now, in disguise, we know
what this function is.",00:45:29.720,00:45:32.180
"We know this function is
the logarithm function.",00:45:32.180,00:45:35.410
"But this is actually a better
way of deriving all of the",00:45:35.410,00:45:40.090
formulas for the logarithm.,00:45:40.090,00:45:42.030
"This is a much quicker
and more efficient",00:45:42.030,00:45:43.970
way of doing it.,00:45:43.970,00:45:44.850
"We had to do it by very
laborious processes.",00:45:44.850,00:45:47.280
"This will allow us to
do it very easily.",00:45:47.280,00:45:51.690
"And so, I'm going to
do that next time.",00:45:51.690,00:45:56.040
"But rather than do that now, I'm
going to point out to you",00:45:56.040,00:45:59.590
"that we can also get truly
new functions.",00:45:59.590,00:46:10.280
"OK, so there are all kinds
of new functions.",00:46:10.280,00:46:12.130
"So this is the first example
of this kind would be, for",00:46:12.130,00:46:15.860
"example, to solve the equation
y' = e ^ - x^2 with y( 0 ) =",00:46:15.860,00:46:23.060
"0, let's say.",00:46:23.060,00:46:25.140
"Now, the solution to that is a
function which again I can",00:46:25.140,00:46:28.860
"write down by the fundamental
theorem.",00:46:28.860,00:46:30.380
"It's the integral from 0
to x of e ^ - t^2 dt.",00:46:30.380,00:46:48.160
"This is a very famous
function.",00:46:48.160,00:46:52.370
"This shape here is known
as the bell curve.",00:46:52.370,00:46:55.820
"And it's the thing
that comes up in",00:46:55.820,00:46:57.010
probability all the time.,00:46:57.010,00:46:59.170
This shape e ^ - x^2.,00:46:59.170,00:47:01.880
"And our function is
geometrically just the area",00:47:01.880,00:47:04.590
under the curve here.,00:47:04.590,00:47:06.310
This is F (x).,00:47:06.310,00:47:09.080
If this place is x.,00:47:09.080,00:47:12.350
"So I have a geometric
definition, I have a way of",00:47:12.350,00:47:14.340
"constructing what it is by
Riemann's sums. And I have a",00:47:14.340,00:47:17.030
function here.,00:47:17.030,00:47:18.810
"But the curious thing about F
( x ) is that F ( x ) cannot",00:47:18.810,00:47:26.070
"be expressed in terms of any
function you've seen",00:47:26.070,00:47:34.470
previously.,00:47:34.470,00:47:35.360
"So logs, exponentials, trig
functions, cannot be.",00:47:35.360,00:47:44.210
It's a totally new function.,00:47:44.210,00:47:51.600
"Nevertheless, we'll be able to
get any possible piece of",00:47:51.600,00:47:54.780
"information we would want to,
out of this function.",00:47:54.780,00:47:56.910
"It's perfectly acceptable
function, it will work just",00:47:56.910,00:47:59.610
great for us.,00:47:59.610,00:48:00.250
Just like any other function.,00:48:00.250,00:48:01.700
Just like the ln.,00:48:01.700,00:48:03.540
"And what this is analogous
to is the",00:48:03.540,00:48:07.060
following kind of thing.,00:48:07.060,00:48:08.890
"If you take the circle, the
ancient Greeks, if you like,",00:48:08.890,00:48:12.650
"already understood that if you
have a circle of radius 1,",00:48:12.650,00:48:17.840
then its area is pi.,00:48:17.840,00:48:23.290
"So that's a geometric
construction of what you could",00:48:23.290,00:48:25.640
call a new number.,00:48:25.640,00:48:31.430
"Which is outside of the realm
of what you might expect.",00:48:31.430,00:48:34.280
"And the weird thing about this
number pi is that it is not",00:48:34.280,00:48:40.660
"the root of an algebraic
equation with rational",00:48:40.660,00:48:50.930
coefficients.,00:48:50.930,00:48:57.260
"It's what's called
transcendental.",00:48:57.260,00:49:00.540
"Meaning, it's just completely
outside of",00:49:00.540,00:49:02.360
the realm of algebra.,00:49:02.360,00:49:04.050
"And, indeed, the logarithm
function is called a",00:49:04.050,00:49:07.270
"transcendental function, because
it's completely out of",00:49:07.270,00:49:10.040
the realm of algebra.,00:49:10.040,00:49:11.350
"It's only in calculus that
you come up with",00:49:11.350,00:49:14.880
this kind of thing.,00:49:14.880,00:49:16.190
"So these kinds of functions
will have access to a huge",00:49:16.190,00:49:21.020
"class of new functions here,
all of which are important",00:49:21.020,00:49:24.180
"tools in science and
engineering.",00:49:24.180,00:49:26.730
"So, see you next time.",00:49:26.730,00:49:29.610
