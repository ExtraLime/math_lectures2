"OK, this is the lecture on
positive definite matrices.",00:00:05.560,00:00:14.460
"I made a start on those
briefly in a previous lecture.",00:00:14.460,00:00:20.770
"One point I wanted to make was
the way that this topic brings",00:00:20.770,00:00:26.180
"the whole course together,
pivots, determinants,",00:00:26.180,00:00:30.300
"eigenvalues, and something
new- four plot instability",00:00:30.300,00:00:36.190
"and then something new in this
expression, x transpose Ax,",00:00:36.190,00:00:42.050
"actually that's the guy
to watch in this lecture.",00:00:42.050,00:00:46.040
"So, so the topic is
positive definite matrix,",00:00:46.040,00:00:50.410
and what's my goal?,00:00:50.410,00:00:53.580
"First, first goal is, how
can I tell if a matrix is",00:00:53.580,00:00:58.440
positive definite?,00:00:58.440,00:00:59.970
"So I would like to
have tests to see",00:00:59.970,00:01:02.490
"if you give me a, a
five by five matrix,",00:01:02.490,00:01:06.100
"how do I tell if it's
positive definite?",00:01:06.100,00:01:09.000
"More important is,
what does it mean?",00:01:09.000,00:01:12.020
"Why are we so interested
in this property",00:01:12.020,00:01:14.700
of positive definiteness?,00:01:14.700,00:01:16.440
"And then, at the end
comes some geometry.",00:01:16.440,00:01:21.410
"Ellipses are connected with
positive definite things.",00:01:21.410,00:01:25.080
"Hyperbolas are not connected
with positive definite things,",00:01:25.080,00:01:28.520
"so we- it's this, we,
there's a geometry too,",00:01:28.520,00:01:33.350
"but mostly it's
linear algebra and --",00:01:33.350,00:01:38.410
"this application of how do you
recognize 'em when you have",00:01:38.410,00:01:43.020
a minim is pretty neat.,00:01:43.020,00:01:45.181
OK.,00:01:45.181,00:01:45.680
I'm gonna begin with two by two.,00:01:45.680,00:01:50.090
"All matrices are
symmetric, right?",00:01:50.090,00:01:52.280
"That's understood; the
matrix is symmetric,",00:01:52.280,00:01:55.180
"now my question is, is
it positive definite?",00:01:55.180,00:02:00.650
"Now, here are some --",00:02:00.650,00:02:04.030
"each one of these is a complete
test for positive definiteness.",00:02:04.030,00:02:09.570
"If I know the eigenvalues,
my test is are they positive?",00:02:09.570,00:02:15.010
Are they all positive?,00:02:15.010,00:02:18.140
If I know these --,00:02:18.140,00:02:21.650
"so, A is really --",00:02:21.650,00:02:24.170
"I look at that number A,
here, as the, as the one",00:02:24.170,00:02:27.570
"by one determinant, and here's
the two by two determinant.",00:02:27.570,00:02:33.420
So this is the determinant test.,00:02:33.420,00:02:35.510
"This is the eigenvalue test,
this is the determinant test.",00:02:35.510,00:02:39.280
"Are the determinants growing in
s- of all, of all end, sort of,",00:02:39.280,00:02:46.040
"can I call them
leading submatrices,",00:02:46.040,00:02:48.640
"they're the first
ones the northwest,",00:02:48.640,00:02:52.140
"Seattle submatrices coming
down from from there,",00:02:52.140,00:02:56.510
"they all, all those determinants
have to be positive,",00:02:56.510,00:02:59.570
"and then another
test is the pivots.",00:02:59.570,00:03:03.020
"The pivots of a
two by two matrix",00:03:03.020,00:03:06.370
"are the number A for sure,
and, since the product",00:03:06.370,00:03:13.070
"is the determinant,
the second pivot",00:03:13.070,00:03:15.410
"must be the determinant
divided by A.",00:03:15.410,00:03:18.980
"And then in here is gonna come
my favorite and my new idea,",00:03:18.980,00:03:24.970
"the, the, the the one to
catch, about x transpose Ax",00:03:24.970,00:03:30.450
being positive.,00:03:30.450,00:03:32.640
"But we'll have to
look at this guy.",00:03:32.640,00:03:35.280
"This gets, like a star, because
for most, presentations,",00:03:35.280,00:03:42.780
"the definition of
positive definiteness",00:03:42.780,00:03:45.610
"would be this number four and
these numbers one two three",00:03:45.610,00:03:49.370
would be test four.,00:03:49.370,00:03:51.260
OK.,00:03:51.260,00:03:51.760
"Maybe I'll tuck this,
where, you know,",00:03:51.760,00:03:56.160
OK.,00:03:56.160,00:03:56.660
"So I'll have to look
at this x transpose Ax.",00:03:56.660,00:04:00.000
"Can you, can we
just be sure, how",00:04:00.000,00:04:07.760
"do we know that the eigenvalue
test and the determinant test,",00:04:07.760,00:04:13.130
"pick out the same
matrices, and let me,",00:04:13.130,00:04:17.170
let's just do a few examples.,00:04:17.170,00:04:19.797
Some examples.,00:04:19.797,00:04:20.380
"Let me pick the matrix
two, six, six, tell me,",00:04:24.610,00:04:31.220
"what number do I have to
put there for the matrix",00:04:31.220,00:04:36.360
to be positive definite?,00:04:36.360,00:04:37.440
"Tell me a sufficiently
large number",00:04:40.150,00:04:42.090
"that would make it
positive definite?",00:04:42.090,00:04:45.020
"Let's just practice with
these conditions in the two",00:04:45.020,00:04:47.830
by two case.,00:04:47.830,00:04:49.370
"Now, when I ask
you that, you don't",00:04:49.370,00:04:51.490
"wanna find the eigenvalues, you
would use the determinant test",00:04:51.490,00:04:56.270
"for that, so, the first
or the pivot test,",00:04:56.270,00:05:00.340
"that, that guy is certainly
positive, that had to happen,",00:05:00.340,00:05:03.750
and it's OK.,00:05:03.750,00:05:05.070
"How large a number here -- the
number had better be more than",00:05:05.070,00:05:09.030
what?,00:05:09.030,00:05:10.200
"More than eighteen, right,
because if it's eight --",00:05:10.200,00:05:14.350
no.,00:05:14.350,00:05:15.400
More than what?,00:05:15.400,00:05:18.550
"Nineteen, is it?",00:05:18.550,00:05:21.390
"If I have a nineteen here,
is that positive definite?",00:05:21.390,00:05:28.965
"I get thirty eight minus
thirty six, that's OK.",00:05:32.590,00:05:36.160
"If I had an eighteen, let
me play it really close.",00:05:36.160,00:05:39.900
"If I have an eighteen there,
then I positive definite?",00:05:39.900,00:05:44.850
Not quite.,00:05:44.850,00:05:46.640
"I would call this
guy positive, so it's",00:05:46.640,00:05:49.830
"useful just to see that
this the borderline.",00:05:49.830,00:05:53.550
"That matrix is on
the borderline,",00:05:53.550,00:05:55.640
"I would call that matrix
positive semi-definite.",00:05:55.640,00:05:58.880
"And what are the
eigenvalues of that matrix,",00:06:04.670,00:06:07.900
"just since we're given
eigenvalues of two by twos,",00:06:07.900,00:06:11.690
"when it's semi-definite, but
not definite, then the --",00:06:11.690,00:06:19.460
"I'm squeezing this
eigenvalue test down, --",00:06:19.460,00:06:22.540
"what's the eigenvalue that
I know this matrix has?",00:06:22.540,00:06:28.370
"What kind of a matrix
have I got here?",00:06:28.370,00:06:31.320
"It's a singular matrix, one
of its eigenvalues is zero.",00:06:31.320,00:06:37.680
"That has an eigenvalue zero,
and the other eigenvalue is --",00:06:37.680,00:06:43.570
"from the trace, twenty.",00:06:43.570,00:06:47.020
OK.,00:06:47.020,00:06:47.620
"So that, that matrix has
eigenvalues greater than",00:06:47.620,00:06:51.560
"or equal to zero, and it's that
""equal to"" that brought this",00:06:51.560,00:06:55.710
"word ""semi-definite"" in.",00:06:55.710,00:06:58.000
"And, the what are the
pivots of that matrix?",00:06:58.000,00:07:01.240
"So the pivots, so
the eigenvalues",00:07:01.240,00:07:03.810
"are zero and twenty, the pivots
are, well, the pivot is two,",00:07:03.810,00:07:10.580
and what's the next pivot?,00:07:10.580,00:07:12.090
There isn't one.,00:07:15.840,00:07:17.430
"We got a singular matrix here,
it'll only have one pivot.",00:07:17.430,00:07:20.900
"You see that that's a rank
one matrix, two six is a --",00:07:20.900,00:07:24.920
"six eighteen is a
multiple of two six,",00:07:24.920,00:07:27.710
"the matrix is singular
it only has one pivot,",00:07:27.710,00:07:32.380
so the pivot test doesn't quite,00:07:32.380,00:07:38.050
"The -- let me do
the x transpose Ax.",00:07:38.050,00:07:40.710
pass.,00:07:40.710,00:07:41.210
Now this is --,00:07:41.210,00:07:45.280
the novelty now.,00:07:45.280,00:07:49.130
OK.,00:07:49.130,00:07:49.960
"What I looking at when I
look at this new combination,",00:07:49.960,00:07:54.470
x transpose Ax.,00:07:54.470,00:07:56.360
"x is any vector now, so
lemme compute, so any vector,",00:07:56.360,00:08:02.140
"lemme call its components
x1 and x2, so that's x.",00:08:02.140,00:08:08.960
And I put in here A.,00:08:08.960,00:08:11.300
"Let's, let's use this example
two six, six eighteen,",00:08:11.300,00:08:15.500
"and here's x
transposed, so x1 x2.",00:08:15.500,00:08:20.500
"We're back to real matrices,
after that last lecture",00:08:20.500,00:08:25.580
"that- that said what to do
in the complex case, let's",00:08:25.580,00:08:29.480
come back to real matrices.,00:08:29.480,00:08:32.010
"So here's x transpose Ax,
and what I'm interested",00:08:32.010,00:08:36.780
"in is, what do I get if I
multiply those together?",00:08:36.780,00:08:42.720
"I get some function of x1
and x2, and what is it?",00:08:42.720,00:08:48.410
"Let's see, if I do this
multiplication, so I do it,",00:08:48.410,00:08:51.700
"lemme, just, I'll just
do it slowly, x1, x2,",00:08:51.700,00:08:55.220
"if I multiply that matrix,
this is 2x1, and 6x2s,",00:08:55.220,00:09:01.980
"and the next row
is 6x1s and 18x2s,",00:09:01.980,00:09:07.400
"and now I do this final
step and what do I have?",00:09:07.400,00:09:11.530
"I've got 2x1 squareds,
got 2X1 squareds",00:09:11.530,00:09:16.810
"is coming from this two, I've
got this one gives me eighteen,",00:09:16.810,00:09:23.080
"well, shall I do the
ones in the middle?",00:09:23.080,00:09:25.630
How many x1 x2s do I have?,00:09:25.630,00:09:29.530
"Let's see, x1 times that
6x2 would be six of 'em,",00:09:29.530,00:09:33.330
"and then x2 times this one
will be six more, I get twelve.",00:09:33.330,00:09:38.300
"So, in here is going, this
is the number a, this is",00:09:38.300,00:09:44.290
"the number 2b, and in here is --",00:09:44.290,00:09:49.190
"x2 times eighteen x2 will be
eighteen x2 squareds and this",00:09:49.190,00:09:54.960
is the number c.,00:09:54.960,00:09:57.630
"So it's ax1 -- it's
like ax squared.",00:09:57.630,00:10:02.010
2bxy and cy squared.,00:10:02.010,00:10:05.140
"For my first point that I
wanted to make by just doing out",00:10:05.140,00:10:11.280
"a multiplication is, that is as
soon as you give me the matrix,",00:10:11.280,00:10:15.720
"as soon as you give me
the matrix, I can --",00:10:15.720,00:10:19.240
"those are the numbers
that appear in --",00:10:19.240,00:10:22.860
"I'll call this
thing a quadratic,",00:10:22.860,00:10:25.580
"you see, it's not
linear anymore.",00:10:25.580,00:10:29.140
"Ax is linear, but now I've
got an x transpose coming",00:10:29.140,00:10:32.360
"in, I'm up to degree
two, up to degree two,",00:10:32.360,00:10:35.680
maybe quadratic is the --,00:10:35.680,00:10:38.880
use the word.,00:10:38.880,00:10:39.480
A quadratic form.,00:10:39.480,00:10:41.980
"It's purely degree two,
there's no linear part,",00:10:41.980,00:10:46.610
"there's no constant
part, there certainly",00:10:46.610,00:10:48.440
"no cubes or fourth powers,
it's all second degree.",00:10:48.440,00:10:53.540
And my question is --,00:10:53.540,00:10:55.780
"is that quantity
positive or not?",00:10:55.780,00:11:00.120
"That's -- for every x1 and x2,
that is my new definition --",00:11:00.120,00:11:08.250
"that's my definition of a
positive definite matrix.",00:11:08.250,00:11:11.920
"If this quantity is positive,
if, if, if, it's positive",00:11:11.920,00:11:17.970
"for all x's and y's, all
x1 x2s, then I call them --",00:11:17.970,00:11:25.140
"then that's the matrix
is positive definite.",00:11:25.140,00:11:29.170
"Now, is this guy
passing our test?",00:11:29.170,00:11:34.340
"Well we have, we anticipated
the answer here by,",00:11:34.340,00:11:38.120
"by asking first about
eigenvalues and pivots,",00:11:38.120,00:11:42.420
and what happened?,00:11:42.420,00:11:44.820
It failed.,00:11:44.820,00:11:46.350
It barely failed.,00:11:46.350,00:11:49.490
"If I had made this
eighteen down to a seven,",00:11:49.490,00:11:53.670
it would've totally failed.,00:11:53.670,00:11:58.120
"I do that with the eraser, and
then I'll put back eighteen,",00:11:58.120,00:12:01.540
"because, seven is such a
total disaster, but if --",00:12:01.540,00:12:07.170
I'll keep seven for a second.,00:12:07.170,00:12:10.240
"Is that thing in any
way positive definite?",00:12:10.240,00:12:15.170
"No, absolutely not.",00:12:15.170,00:12:18.480
"I don't know its eigenvalues,
but I know for sure one of them",00:12:18.480,00:12:21.990
is negative.,00:12:21.990,00:12:24.230
"Its pivots are two and then
the next pivot would be",00:12:24.230,00:12:28.940
"the determinant over two, and
the determinant is -- what,",00:12:28.940,00:12:32.250
"what's the determinant
of this thing?",00:12:32.250,00:12:35.090
"Fourteen minus
thirty six, I've got",00:12:35.090,00:12:37.620
a determinant minus twenty two.,00:12:37.620,00:12:39.820
"The next pivot will
be -- the pivots now,",00:12:39.820,00:12:43.330
"of this thing are two and
minus eleven or something.",00:12:43.330,00:12:48.480
"Their product being minus
twenty two the determinant.",00:12:48.480,00:12:51.320
"This thing is not
positive definite.",00:12:51.320,00:12:53.620
"What would be -- let me look
at the x transpose Ax for this",00:12:53.620,00:12:57.200
guy.,00:12:57.200,00:12:57.700
"What's -- if I do out
this multiplication,",00:12:57.700,00:13:00.460
"this eighteen is temporarily
changing to a seven.",00:13:00.460,00:13:04.560
"This eighteen is temporarily
changing to a seven,",00:13:04.560,00:13:08.130
"and I know that there's
some numbers x1 and x2",00:13:08.130,00:13:16.610
"for which that thing, that
function, is negative.",00:13:16.610,00:13:24.880
"And I'm desperately trying
to think what they are.",00:13:24.880,00:13:28.640
Maybe you can see.,00:13:28.640,00:13:30.040
"Can you tell me a

"that makes this
quantity negative?",00:13:33.940,00:13:36.675
"Oh, maybe one and minus one?",00:13:40.400,00:13:43.180
"Yes, that's -- in this case,
that, will work, right,",00:13:43.180,00:13:49.270
"if I took x1 to be one,
and x2 to be minus one,",00:13:49.270,00:13:54.150
"then I always get something
positive, the two,",00:13:54.150,00:13:57.170
"and the seven minus one squared,
but this would be minus twelve",00:13:57.170,00:14:01.367
"and the whole thing
would be negative;",00:14:01.367,00:14:02.950
"I would have two minus twelve
plus seven, a negative.",00:14:02.950,00:14:07.620
"If I drew the graph, can I
get the little picture in",00:14:07.620,00:14:11.550
here?,00:14:11.550,00:14:12.050
"If I draw the graph
of this thing?",00:14:12.050,00:14:16.430
"So, graphs, of the
function f(x,y), or f(x),",00:14:16.430,00:14:22.730
"so I say here f(x,y) equal
this -- x transpose Ax, this,",00:14:22.730,00:14:29.620
"this this ax squared,
2bxy, and cy squared.",00:14:29.620,00:14:32.040
"And, let's take the
example, with these numbers.",00:14:32.040,00:14:46.600
"OK, so here's the x axis,
here's the y axis, and here's --",00:14:49.210,00:14:54.650
up is the function.,00:14:54.650,00:14:56.380
"z, if you like, or f.",00:14:56.380,00:14:59.390
"I apologize, and let me,
just once in my life here,",00:14:59.390,00:15:03.940
"put an arrow over these,
these, axes so you see them.",00:15:03.940,00:15:08.780
"That's the vector and I just,
see, instead of x1 and x2,",00:15:08.780,00:15:13.300
"I made them x- the
components x and y.",00:15:13.300,00:15:16.220
OK.,00:15:16.220,00:15:16.930
"So, so, what's a graph of 2x
squared, twelve xy, and seven y",00:15:16.930,00:15:23.660
squared?,00:15:23.660,00:15:25.710
I'd like to see --,00:15:25.710,00:15:27.660
"I not the greatest
artist, but let's --",00:15:27.660,00:15:31.260
"tell me something about
this graph of this function.",00:15:31.260,00:15:38.400
"Whoa, tell me one point
that it goes through.",00:15:42.560,00:15:44.740
The origin.,00:15:47.970,00:15:49.470
Right?,00:15:49.470,00:15:50.990

thing to go through the origin,",00:15:50.990,00:15:56.450

I certainly get zero.",00:15:56.450,00:16:00.421
OK.,00:16:00.421,00:16:00.920
Some more points.,00:16:00.920,00:16:02.540
"If x is one and y is zero,
then I'm going upwards,",00:16:02.540,00:16:06.570
"so I'm going up this
way, and I'm, I'm",00:16:06.570,00:16:09.060
"going up, like, two x
squared in that direction.",00:16:09.060,00:16:12.180
"So -- that's meant
to be a parabola.",00:16:12.180,00:16:14.766
"And, suppose x stays
zero and y increases.",00:16:18.200,00:16:23.150
"Well, y could be positive or
negative; it's seven y squared.",00:16:23.150,00:16:26.760
Is this function going upward?,00:16:26.760,00:16:30.530
"In the x direction it's going
upward, and in the y direction",00:16:30.530,00:16:35.640
"it's going upwards,
and if x equals y",00:16:35.640,00:16:39.900
"then the forty-five degree
direction is certainly",00:16:39.900,00:16:42.140
"going upwards; because
then we'd have what,",00:16:42.140,00:16:44.810
"about, everything would
be positive, but what?",00:16:44.810,00:16:49.600
"This function -- what's
the graph of this function?",00:16:49.600,00:16:54.810
Look like?,00:16:54.810,00:16:55.310
"Tell me the word that describes
the graph of this function.",00:16:55.310,00:17:00.450
"This is the non-positive
definite here,",00:17:00.450,00:17:02.980

here, for some reason",00:17:02.980,00:17:07.660
"got started in a negative
direction, your case that",00:17:07.660,00:17:10.740
isn't positive definite.,00:17:10.740,00:17:12.750
"And what's the graph look like
that goes up, but does it --",00:17:12.750,00:17:17.190
"do we have a minimum here, does
it go from, from the origin?",00:17:17.190,00:17:22.710
Completely?,00:17:22.710,00:17:24.500
"No, because we just checked
that this thing failed.",00:17:24.500,00:17:28.710
"It failed along the direction
when x was minus y --",00:17:28.710,00:17:33.490

"to the least, tell you the word.",00:17:37.080,00:17:39.350
"This thing, goes up
in some directions,",00:17:39.350,00:17:46.470

and if we actually knew what",00:17:46.470,00:17:53.330
"a saddle looked like or
thinks saddles do that --",00:17:53.330,00:17:59.300
"the way your legs go is,
like, down, up, the way, you,",00:17:59.300,00:18:06.560
"looking like, forward, and, the,
and drawing the thing is even",00:18:06.560,00:18:16.200
worse than describing --,00:18:16.200,00:18:17.330
"I'm just going to say in
some directions we go up",00:18:17.330,00:18:20.760
"and in other directions,
there is, a saddle --",00:18:20.760,00:18:28.290
"Now I'm sorry I put
that on the front board,",00:18:28.290,00:18:30.330
"you have no way to cover
it, but it's a saddle.",00:18:30.330,00:18:34.450
OK.,00:18:34.450,00:18:35.360
"And, and this is a
saddle point, it's",00:18:35.360,00:18:38.950
"the, it's the point that's at
the maximum in some directions",00:18:38.950,00:18:43.900
"and at the minimum
in other directions.",00:18:43.900,00:18:46.770
"And actually, the perfect
directions to look",00:18:46.770,00:18:50.840
are the eigenvector directions.,00:18:50.840,00:18:53.670
We'll see that.,00:18:53.670,00:18:55.260
"So this is, not a
positive definite matrix.",00:18:55.260,00:19:03.730
OK.,00:19:03.730,00:19:04.280
"Now I'm coming back
to this example,",00:19:04.280,00:19:08.190
"getting rid of this seven,
let's move it up to twenty.",00:19:08.190,00:19:14.400
"Let's, let's let's make the
thing really positive definite.",00:19:14.400,00:19:18.420
OK.,00:19:18.420,00:19:19.470
"So this is, this
number's now twenty.",00:19:19.470,00:19:22.990
c is now twenty.,00:19:22.990,00:19:24.360
OK.,00:19:24.360,00:19:24.860
"Now that passes the test, which
I haven't proved, of course,",00:19:24.860,00:19:30.800
"it passes the test
for positive pivots.",00:19:30.800,00:19:34.960
"It passes the test for
positive eigenvalues.",00:19:34.960,00:19:40.270
"How can you tell that the
eigenvalues of that matrix",00:19:40.270,00:19:43.160
"are positive without
actually finding them?",00:19:43.160,00:19:45.850
"Of course, two by two I could
find them, but can you see --",00:19:45.850,00:19:49.400
how do I know they're positive?,00:19:49.400,00:19:51.530
I know that their product is --,00:19:51.530,00:19:53.270
"I know that lambda one times
lambda two is positive, why?",00:19:53.270,00:19:58.020
"Because that's the
determinant, right,",00:19:58.020,00:20:01.750
"lambda one times lambda two is
the determinant, which is forty",00:20:01.750,00:20:06.000
minus thirty-six is four.,00:20:06.000,00:20:07.730
So the determinant is four.,00:20:07.730,00:20:11.120
"And the trace, the sum down
the diagonal, is twenty-two.",00:20:11.120,00:20:16.160
"So, they multiply to give four.",00:20:16.160,00:20:20.630
"So that leaves the
possibility they're either",00:20:20.630,00:20:22.850
both positive or both negative.,00:20:22.850,00:20:25.730
"But if they're both negative,
the trace couldn't be",00:20:25.730,00:20:29.979
"So they're both
positive. twenty-two.",00:20:29.979,00:20:31.520
"So both of the eigenvalues
that are positive,",00:20:31.520,00:20:34.170
"both of the pivots
are positive --",00:20:34.170,00:20:36.220
"the determinants are positive,
and I believe that this",00:20:36.220,00:20:39.820
"function is positive everywhere
except at zero, zero,",00:20:39.820,00:20:47.260
of course.,00:20:47.260,00:20:48.240
"When I write down
this condition,",00:20:48.240,00:20:52.330
"So I believe that
x transposed, let",00:20:52.330,00:20:54.670
"me copy, x transpose Ax is
positive, except, of course,",00:20:54.670,00:21:00.280
"at the minimum point,
at zero, of course,",00:21:00.280,00:21:07.450
I don't expect miracles.,00:21:07.450,00:21:08.830
"So what does its graph look
like, and how do I check,",00:21:11.760,00:21:15.720
"and how do I check that
this really is positive?",00:21:15.720,00:21:18.730
"So we take it's
graph for a minute.",00:21:22.300,00:21:24.960
"What would be the graph
of that function --",00:21:24.960,00:21:27.200
it does not have a saddle point.,00:21:27.200,00:21:29.400
"Let me -- I'll raise
the board, here,",00:21:29.400,00:21:31.280
"and stay with this
example for a while.",00:21:31.280,00:21:33.320
"So I want to do the graph
of -- here's my function,",00:21:36.280,00:21:40.660
"two x squared, twelve xy-s, that
could be positive or negative,",00:21:40.660,00:21:46.940
and twenty y squared.,00:21:46.940,00:21:48.510
"But my point is, so you're
seeing the underlying point is,",00:21:48.510,00:21:56.290
"that, the things are
positive definite",00:21:56.290,00:21:59.910
"when in some way, these,
these pure squares, squares",00:21:59.910,00:22:05.730
"we know to be positive, and
when those kind of overwhelm",00:22:05.730,00:22:10.180
"this guy, who could be
m- positive or negative,",00:22:10.180,00:22:13.527
"because some like
or have same or have",00:22:13.527,00:22:15.110
"same or different signs,
when these are big enough",00:22:15.110,00:22:19.760
"they overwhelm this guy and
make the total thing positive,",00:22:19.760,00:22:22.850
"and what would the
graph now look like?",00:22:22.850,00:22:25.750
"Let me draw the x - well, let
me draw the x direction, the y",00:22:25.750,00:22:32.940
"direction, and the origin,
at zero, zero, I'm there,",00:22:32.940,00:22:40.970
"where do I go as I move
away from the origin?",00:22:40.970,00:22:45.650
"Where do I go as I move
away from the origin?",00:22:45.650,00:22:50.780
I'm sure that I go up.,00:22:50.780,00:22:53.240
"The origin, the
center point here,",00:22:53.240,00:22:56.660
"is a minim because this thing I
believe, and we better see why,",00:22:56.660,00:23:01.730
"it's, the graph is like a bowl,
the graph is like a bowl shape,",00:23:01.730,00:23:07.620
it's -- here's the minimum.,00:23:07.620,00:23:09.805
"And because we've
got a pure quadratic,",00:23:15.660,00:23:19.030
"we know it sits at the origin,
we know it's tangent plane,",00:23:19.030,00:23:23.410
"the first derivatives are zero,
so, we know, first derivatives,",00:23:23.410,00:23:30.970
"First derivatives are
all zero, but that's",00:23:30.970,00:23:37.410
not enough for a minimum.,00:23:37.410,00:23:38.560
"It's first derivatives
were zero here.",00:23:38.560,00:23:43.020
"So, the partial derivatives,
the first derivatives, are zero.",00:23:45.780,00:23:51.200
"Again, because first derivatives
are gonna have an x or an a y,",00:23:51.200,00:23:56.720
"or a y in them, they'll
be zero at the origin.",00:23:56.720,00:23:59.730
"It's the second derivatives
that control everything.",00:23:59.730,00:24:03.340
"It's the second derivatives
that this matrix is telling us,",00:24:03.340,00:24:07.810
and somehow --,00:24:07.810,00:24:10.630
here's my point.,00:24:10.630,00:24:11.780
"You remember in Calculus, how
did you decide on a minimum?",00:24:11.780,00:24:16.710
"First requirement was, that
the derivative had to be",00:24:16.710,00:24:20.010
zero.,00:24:20.010,00:24:20.940
"But then you didn't know if
you had a minimum or a maximum.",00:24:20.940,00:24:25.890
"To know that you
had a minimum, you",00:24:25.890,00:24:27.500
"had to look at the
second derivative.",00:24:27.500,00:24:30.300
"The second derivative
had to be positive,",00:24:30.300,00:24:33.400
"the slope had to be
increasing as you",00:24:33.400,00:24:36.900
went through the minimum point.,00:24:36.900,00:24:40.010
"The curvature had to
go upwards, and that's",00:24:40.010,00:24:43.470
"what we're doing now
in two dimensions,",00:24:43.470,00:24:46.910
and in n dimensions.,00:24:46.910,00:24:49.280
"So we're doing what
we did in Calculus.",00:24:49.280,00:24:52.030
"Second derivative
positive, m- will now",00:24:52.030,00:24:55.150
"become that the matrix
of second derivatives",00:24:55.150,00:24:58.590
is positive definite.,00:24:58.590,00:25:00.810
Can I just --,00:25:00.810,00:25:02.650
like a translation of --,00:25:02.650,00:25:05.670
"this is how minimum are coming
in, ithe beginning of Calculus",00:25:05.670,00:25:11.890
--,00:25:11.890,00:25:14.640
"we had a minimum was associated
with second derivative,",00:25:14.640,00:25:22.730
being positive.,00:25:22.730,00:25:24.170
"And first derivative
zero, of course.",00:25:24.170,00:25:27.340
"Derivative, first
derivative, but it",00:25:27.340,00:25:36.120
"was the second derivative
that told us we had a minimum.",00:25:36.120,00:25:39.870
"And now, in 18.06,
in linear algebra,",00:25:39.870,00:25:43.510
"we'll have a minim
for our function now,",00:25:43.510,00:25:47.260
"our function will have, for
your function be a function not",00:25:47.260,00:25:53.040
"of just x but several variables,
the way functions really",00:25:53.040,00:26:00.290
"are in real life,
the minimum will",00:26:00.290,00:26:03.370
"be when the matrix of second
derivatives, the matrix",00:26:03.370,00:26:15.140
"here was one by one, there was
just one second derivative,",00:26:15.140,00:26:17.590
now we've got lots.,00:26:17.590,00:26:20.560
Is positive definite.,00:26:20.560,00:26:25.335
"So positive for a
number translates",00:26:29.070,00:26:31.450
"into positive
definite for a matrix.",00:26:31.450,00:26:34.450
"And it this brings
everything you check pivots,",00:26:34.450,00:26:38.860
"you check determinants,
you check all your values,",00:26:38.860,00:26:41.680
or you check this minimum stuff.,00:26:41.680,00:26:44.910
OK.,00:26:44.910,00:26:45.410
Let me come back to this graph.,00:26:45.410,00:26:49.190
That graph goes upwards.,00:26:49.190,00:26:50.595
And I'll have to see why.,00:26:53.220,00:26:54.740
"How do I know that this,
that this function is always",00:26:54.740,00:26:58.360
positive?,00:26:58.360,00:26:59.980
"Can you look at that and tell
that it's always positive?",00:26:59.980,00:27:04.770
"Maybe two by two, you
could feel pretty sure,",00:27:04.770,00:27:08.710
"but what's the good way to
show that this thing is always",00:27:08.710,00:27:14.530

really what I'm most interested",00:31:47.900,00:31:53.820
OK.,00:31:53.820,00:31:54.610
in.,00:31:54.610,00:31:55.110
OK.,00:31:55.110,00:31:55.610
"By -- I just have to ask,
do you recognize, I mean,",00:31:55.610,00:32:00.300
"these numbers here, the
two that appeared outside,",00:32:00.300,00:32:04.460

come from elimination.",00:32:08.090,00:32:13.690

is our good old method",00:32:13.690,00:32:18.890
"of Gaussian elimination,

in terms of these squares.,00:32:24.910,00:32:27.280
"The -- let me show
you what I mean.",00:32:27.280,00:32:30.600
"I just think those
numbers are no accident,",00:32:30.600,00:32:34.050
"If I take my matrix two,
six, six, and twenty,",00:32:34.050,00:32:40.050
"and I do elimination,
then the pivot is two",00:32:40.050,00:32:45.050
"and I take three,
what's the multiplier?",00:32:45.050,00:32:50.150
"How much of row one do I
take away from row two?",00:32:50.150,00:32:54.180
Three.,00:32:54.180,00:32:55.360
"So what you're seeing in
this, completing the square,",00:32:55.360,00:32:58.700
"is the pivots outside and
the multiplier inside.",00:32:58.700,00:33:05.180
Just do that again?,00:33:05.180,00:33:06.680
"The pivot is two, three -- three
of those away from that gives",00:33:06.680,00:33:12.840
"me two, six, zero, and
what's the second pivot?",00:33:12.840,00:33:18.100
"Three of this away from this,
three sixes'll be eighteen,",00:33:18.100,00:33:21.550

pivot will also be a",00:33:21.550,00:33:23.380
two.,00:33:23.380,00:33:24.040
"So that's the U, this is
the A, and of course the L",00:33:24.040,00:33:32.490
"was one, zero, one, and
the multiplier was three.",00:33:32.490,00:33:37.900
"So, completing the
square is elimination.",00:33:40.540,00:33:48.210
"Why I happy to see, happy
to see that coming together?",00:33:48.210,00:33:54.230

elimination for m by m matrices.",00:33:54.230,00:34:01.190

completing the square, here,",00:34:01.190,00:34:07.740
for two by twos.,00:34:07.740,00:34:10.320
But now I see what's going on.,00:34:10.320,00:34:12.989
"Completing the square really
amounts to splitting this thing",00:34:12.989,00:34:17.909

what's the critical thing --",00:34:17.909,00:34:21.610

"are multipliers but
they're squares,",00:34:25.380,00:34:28.020

outside these squares?",00:34:28.020,00:34:31.790
"When I complete the square,
what are the numbers that go",00:34:31.790,00:34:35.210
outside?,00:34:35.210,00:34:36.179
They're the pivots.,00:34:36.179,00:34:37.342
"They're the pivots, and that's
why positive pivots give me",00:34:39.889,00:34:45.510
sum of squares.,00:34:45.510,00:34:47.409
"Positive pivots, those
pivots are the numbers",00:34:47.409,00:34:50.270
"that go outside the
squares, so positive pivots,",00:34:50.270,00:34:53.600
"sum of squares, everything
positive, graph goes up,",00:34:53.600,00:34:57.850

it's all connected together;",00:34:57.850,00:35:03.050
all connected together.,00:35:03.050,00:35:04.710
"And in the two by two case,
you can see those connections,",00:35:04.710,00:35:08.110
"but linear algebra now can go
up to three by three, m by m.",00:35:08.110,00:35:16.100
Let's do that next.,00:35:16.100,00:35:17.950

"The eigenvalues I've got, what
do I have a cubic equation --",00:41:08.600,00:41:12.860
a degree three equation?,00:41:12.860,00:41:14.320
"There are three
eigenvalues to find.",00:41:17.230,00:41:19.350

I've said today,",00:41:23.350,00:41:25.200

these eigenvalues,",00:41:25.200,00:41:27.800
"even though I don't
know the exact numbers.",00:41:27.800,00:41:30.710
I -- I remember the numbers.,00:41:30.710,00:41:34.535
"Because these matrices
are so important",00:41:37.100,00:41:39.740
that people figure them.,00:41:39.740,00:41:43.750
"But -- what do you believe
to be true about these three",00:41:43.750,00:41:47.440
"eigenvalues -- you believe
that they are all positive.",00:41:47.440,00:41:52.950
They're all positive.,00:41:52.950,00:41:54.270
"I think that they are two
minus square root of two, two,",00:41:54.270,00:42:00.910
"and two plus the
square root of two.",00:42:00.910,00:42:02.630
I think.,00:42:02.630,00:42:03.720
Let me just --,00:42:03.720,00:42:05.490
"I can't write those numbers
down without checking",00:42:05.490,00:42:08.280
"the simple checks, what
the first simple check is",00:42:08.280,00:42:10.870
"the trace, so if I add
those numbers I get six",00:42:10.870,00:42:15.110
"and if I add those
numbers I get six.",00:42:15.110,00:42:18.970
"The other simple test is
the determinant, if I --",00:42:18.970,00:42:24.150
"can you do this, can you
multiply those numbers",00:42:24.150,00:42:26.930
together?,00:42:26.930,00:42:29.240
"I guess we can multiply
by two out there.",00:42:29.240,00:42:32.610
"What's two minus square
root of two times two",00:42:32.610,00:42:35.010
"plus square root of two,
that'll be four minus two,",00:42:35.010,00:42:39.530
"that'll be two,
yeah, two times two,",00:42:39.530,00:42:41.610
"that's got the determinant,
right, so it's got,",00:42:41.610,00:42:46.280
"it's got a chance of being
correct and I think it is.",00:42:46.280,00:42:49.810
"Now, what's the x transpose Ax?",00:42:49.810,00:42:51.990
"I better give myself
enough room for that.",00:42:51.990,00:42:54.610
x transpose Ax for this guy.,00:42:54.610,00:42:59.180
"It's two x1 squareds, and two x2
squareds, and two x3 squareds.",00:42:59.180,00:43:07.290
"Those come from the
diagonal, those were easy.",00:43:07.290,00:43:10.800
"Now off the diagonal
there's a minus and a minus,",00:43:10.800,00:43:13.490
"they come together there'll be
a minus two minus two whats?",00:43:13.490,00:43:20.010
"Are coming from this one two and
two one position, is the x1 x2.",00:43:20.010,00:43:26.390
"I'm doing mentally
a multiplication",00:43:26.390,00:43:30.900
"of this matrix
times a row vector",00:43:30.900,00:43:34.300
"on the left times a column
vector on the right,",00:43:34.300,00:43:37.680
"and I know that these numbers
show up in the answer.",00:43:37.680,00:43:41.730
"The diagonal is
the perfect square,",00:43:41.730,00:43:45.060
"this off diagonal is
a minus two x1 x2,",00:43:45.060,00:43:49.110
"and there are no x1 x3-s, and
there're minus two x2 x3-s.",00:43:49.110,00:43:55.280
"And I believe that that
expression is always positive.",00:43:55.280,00:43:58.860
"I believe that that
curve, that graph, really,",00:44:01.670,00:44:06.010
"of that function,
this is my function f,",00:44:06.010,00:44:09.720
"and I'm in more dimensions
now than I can draw, it --",00:44:09.720,00:44:14.770
"but the graph of that
function goes upwards.",00:44:14.770,00:44:20.080
It's a bowl.,00:44:20.080,00:44:22.320
Or maybe the right word is --,00:44:22.320,00:44:26.320
"just forgot, what's
a long word for bowl?",00:44:26.320,00:44:34.210
"Hm, maybe paraboloid, I
think, paraboloid comes in.",00:44:34.210,00:44:42.570
"I'll edit the tape
and get that word in.",00:44:42.570,00:44:46.150
"Bowl, let's say, is, that,
so that, and if I can --",00:44:46.150,00:44:54.410
"I could complete the
squares, I could write that",00:44:54.410,00:44:56.700
"as the sum of three squares,
and those three squares",00:44:56.700,00:44:59.740
"would get multiplied
by the three pivots.",00:44:59.740,00:45:02.780
And the pivots are all positive.,00:45:02.780,00:45:05.440
"So I would have positive
pivots times squares,",00:45:05.440,00:45:08.760
"the net result would
be a positive function",00:45:08.760,00:45:11.630
and a bowl which goes upwards.,00:45:11.630,00:45:14.520
"And then, finally, if I cut --
if I slice through this bowl,",00:45:14.520,00:45:19.230
"if I -- now I'm asking you
to stretch your visualization",00:45:19.230,00:45:23.730
"here, because I'm
in four dimensions,",00:45:23.730,00:45:26.680
"I've got x1 x2 x3 in the base,
and this function is z, or f,",00:45:26.680,00:45:33.610
or something.,00:45:33.610,00:45:35.000
And its graph is going up.,00:45:35.000,00:45:38.320
"But I'm in four dimensions,
because I've got three",00:45:38.320,00:45:40.530
"in the base and then
the upward direction,",00:45:40.530,00:45:43.410
"but now if I cut through this
four-dimensional picture,",00:45:43.410,00:45:49.640
"at level one, so, suppose
I cut through this thing",00:45:49.640,00:45:55.720
at height one.,00:45:55.720,00:45:58.100
"So I take all the points
that are at height one.",00:45:58.100,00:46:01.470
That gives me --,00:46:04.980,00:46:07.770
"it gave me an ellipse over
there, in that two by two case,",00:46:07.770,00:46:14.180
"in this case, this will be
the equation of an ellipsoid,",00:46:14.180,00:46:19.350
a football in other words.,00:46:19.350,00:46:20.830
"Well, not quite a football.",00:46:23.770,00:46:25.170
A lopsided football.,00:46:25.170,00:46:26.450
"What would be, can I try
to describe to you what",00:46:26.450,00:46:30.960
"the ellipsoid will look
like, this ellipsoid,",00:46:30.960,00:46:35.590
"I'm sorry that the, that I've
ended the matrix right --",00:46:35.590,00:46:40.440
"at the point, let's -- let me be
sure you've seen the equation.",00:46:40.440,00:46:46.230
"Two x1 squared, two x2 squared,
two x3 squared, minus two",00:46:46.230,00:46:51.130
"of the cross parts, equal what?",00:46:51.130,00:46:57.000
"That is the equation
of a football, so what",00:46:57.000,00:47:00.720
"do I mean by a football
or an ellipsoid?",00:47:00.720,00:47:03.780
"I mean that, well,
I'll draw a few.",00:47:03.780,00:47:12.520
"It's like that,
it's got a center,",00:47:12.520,00:47:21.750
"and it's got it's got
three principal directions.",00:47:21.750,00:47:31.990
This ellipsoid.,00:47:31.990,00:47:32.830
"So -- you see what I'm saying,
if we have a sphere then all",00:47:32.830,00:47:35.660
directions would be the same.,00:47:35.660,00:47:36.890
"If we had a true football, or
it's closer to a rugby ball,",00:47:39.530,00:47:44.750
"really, because it's more
curved than a football,",00:47:44.750,00:47:48.110
"it would have one long
direction and the other two",00:47:48.110,00:47:52.270
would be equal.,00:47:52.270,00:47:54.020
"That would be like
having a matrix",00:47:54.020,00:47:56.240
"that had one
eigenvalue repeated.",00:47:56.240,00:47:59.700
And then one other different.,00:47:59.700,00:48:02.080
"So this sphere comes from,
like, the identity matrix,",00:48:02.080,00:48:04.940
all eigenvalues the same.,00:48:04.940,00:48:07.600
"Our rugby ball comes
from a case where --",00:48:07.600,00:48:12.370
"three, the three, two of the
three eigenvalues are the same.",00:48:12.370,00:48:17.070
"But we know how the case
where -- the typical case,",00:48:17.070,00:48:20.000
"where the three eigenvalues
were all different.",00:48:20.000,00:48:23.340
So this will have --,00:48:23.340,00:48:25.551
"How do I say it, if I look
at this ellipsoid correctly,",00:48:28.440,00:48:31.830
"it'll have a major axis,
it'll have a middle axis,",00:48:31.830,00:48:37.200
and it'll have a minor axis.,00:48:37.200,00:48:41.520
"And those three axes
will be in the direction",00:48:41.520,00:48:44.940
of the eigenvectors.,00:48:44.940,00:48:47.450
"And the lengths of
those axes will be",00:48:47.450,00:48:50.760
determined by the eigenvalues.,00:48:50.760,00:48:52.496
I can get --,00:48:55.260,00:48:56.770
"turn this all into linear
algebra, because we have --",00:48:56.770,00:49:02.520
"the right thing we know about
eigenvectors and eigenvalues,",00:49:02.520,00:49:06.410
for that matrix is what?,00:49:06.410,00:49:08.120
"Of -- let me just tell you that,
repeat the main linear algebra",00:49:08.120,00:49:11.970
point.,00:49:11.970,00:49:13.070
"How could we turn what
I said into algebra;",00:49:13.070,00:49:18.970
"we would write this A as
Q, the eigenvector matrix,",00:49:18.970,00:49:25.050
"times lambda, the eigenvalue
matrix times Q transposed.",00:49:25.050,00:49:30.370
"The principal axis
theorem, we'll call it,",00:49:30.370,00:49:33.010
now.,00:49:33.010,00:49:33.900
"The eigenvectors tell us the
directions of the principal",00:49:33.900,00:49:37.980
axes.,00:49:37.980,00:49:39.110

lengths of those axes, actually",00:49:39.110,00:49:43.240
"the lengths, or
the half-lengths,",00:49:43.240,00:49:45.160
"or one over the
eigenvalues, it turns out.",00:49:45.160,00:49:48.970
"And that is the
matrix factorization",00:49:48.970,00:49:53.260
"which is the most
important matrix",00:49:53.260,00:49:55.490
"factorization in our
eigenvalue material so far.",00:49:55.490,00:50:00.540
"That's diagonalization
for a symmetric matrix,",00:50:00.540,00:50:04.320
"so instead of the inverse
I can write the transposed.",00:50:04.320,00:50:09.350
OK.,00:50:09.350,00:50:09.930
"I've -- so what I've tried
today is to tell you the --",00:50:09.930,00:50:14.140
"what's going on with
positive definite matrices.",00:50:14.140,00:50:20.510
"Ah, you see all how all
these pieces are there",00:50:20.510,00:50:23.020
"and linear algebra
connects them.",00:50:23.020,00:50:25.721
OK.,00:50:25.721,00:50:26.220
