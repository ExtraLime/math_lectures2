"PROFESSOR: OK, we're ready to
start the eleventh lecture.",00:00:22.040,00:00:25.380
"We're still in the middle
of sketching.",00:00:25.380,00:00:29.390
"And, indeed, one of the reasons
why we did not talk",00:00:29.390,00:00:33.250
"about hyperbolic functions is
this that we're running just a",00:00:33.250,00:00:38.490
little bit behind.,00:00:38.490,00:00:39.540
"And we'll catch up
a tiny bit today.",00:00:39.540,00:00:41.720
"And I hope all the way on
Tuesday of next week.",00:00:41.720,00:00:46.000
"So let me pick up where we
left off, with sketching.",00:00:46.000,00:00:58.640
So this is a continuation.,00:00:58.640,00:01:05.220
"I want to give you one
more example of",00:01:05.220,00:01:07.440
how to sketch things.,00:01:07.440,00:01:08.390
"And then we'll go through
it systematically.",00:01:08.390,00:01:10.380
"So the second example that
we did as one example",00:01:10.380,00:01:13.450
"last time, is this.",00:01:13.450,00:01:18.060
"The function is x
+ + 1 / x + + 2.",00:01:18.060,00:01:21.970
"And I'm going to save you
the time right now.",00:01:21.970,00:01:25.780
"This is very typical of me,
especially if you're in a",00:01:25.780,00:01:29.140
"hurry on an exam, I'll
just tell you what",00:01:29.140,00:01:30.860
the derivative is.,00:01:30.860,00:01:32.920
"So in this case, it's
1 / (x + 2)^2.",00:01:32.920,00:01:37.760
"Now, the reason why I'm bringing
this example up, even",00:01:37.760,00:01:42.650
"though it'll turn out to be
a relatively simple one to",00:01:42.650,00:01:44.720
"sketch, is that it's easy to
fall into a black hole with",00:01:44.720,00:01:51.890
this problem.,00:01:51.890,00:01:53.890
So let me just show you.,00:01:53.890,00:01:57.470
This is not equal to 0.,00:01:57.470,00:01:59.600
It's never equal to 0.,00:01:59.600,00:02:01.180
"So that means there are
no critical points.",00:02:01.180,00:02:08.940
"At this point, students, many
students who have been trained",00:02:08.940,00:02:15.460
"like monkeys to do exactly
what they've been told,",00:02:15.460,00:02:18.710
suddenly freeze and give up.,00:02:18.710,00:02:21.170
Because there's nothing to do.,00:02:21.170,00:02:23.970
"So this is the one thing that
I have to train out of you.",00:02:23.970,00:02:28.000
"You can't just give
up at this point.",00:02:28.000,00:02:32.260
So what would you suggest?,00:02:32.260,00:02:35.060
"Can anybody get us
out of this jam?",00:02:35.060,00:02:38.100
Yeah.,00:02:38.100,00:02:38.780
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:02:38.780,00:02:47.410
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:02:47.410,00:02:48.150
"So the suggestion was
to find the x values",00:02:48.150,00:02:52.810
where f (x) is undefined.,00:02:52.810,00:02:55.800
"In fact, so now that's a fairly
sophisticated way of",00:02:55.800,00:03:00.850
"putting the point that I want to
make, which is that what we",00:03:00.850,00:03:04.410
"want to do is go back to
our precalculus skills.",00:03:04.410,00:03:07.770
And just plot points.,00:03:07.770,00:03:11.150
"So instead, you go back to
precalculus and you just plot",00:03:11.150,00:03:14.900
some points.,00:03:14.900,00:03:17.220
"It's a perfectly reasonable
thing.",00:03:17.220,00:03:18.350
"Now, it turns out that the most
important point to plot",00:03:18.350,00:03:21.970
is the one that's not there.,00:03:21.970,00:03:24.730
"Namely, the value of x = - 2.",00:03:24.730,00:03:29.300
"Which is just what
was suggested.",00:03:29.300,00:03:31.780
"Namely, we plot the
points where the",00:03:31.780,00:03:34.990
function is not defined.,00:03:34.990,00:03:38.710
So how do we do that?,00:03:38.710,00:03:41.220
"Well, you have to think about
it for a second and I'll",00:03:41.220,00:03:44.200
"introduce some new notation
when I do it.",00:03:44.200,00:03:46.470
"If I evaluate 2 at this place,
actually I can't do it.",00:03:46.470,00:03:49.290
"I have to do it from the
left and the right.",00:03:49.290,00:03:51.250
"So if I plug in - 2 on the
positive side, from the right,",00:03:51.250,00:03:57.840
"that's going to be equal to - 2
+ 1 / - 2, a little bit more",00:03:57.840,00:04:04.150
"than - 2, +2.",00:04:04.150,00:04:06.590
"Which is - 1 divided by - now,
this denominator is - 2, a",00:04:06.590,00:04:11.190
"little more than that, +2.",00:04:11.190,00:04:12.730
So it's a little more than 0.,00:04:12.730,00:04:20.200
"And that is, well we'll fill
that in in a second.",00:04:20.200,00:04:24.720
Everybody's puzzled.,00:04:24.720,00:04:25.620
Yes.,00:04:25.620,00:04:26.040
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:04:26.040,00:04:30.670
"PROFESSOR: No, that's
the function.",00:04:30.670,00:04:37.660
"I'm plotting points, I'm
not differentiating.",00:04:37.660,00:04:37.980
"I've already differentiated
it.",00:04:37.980,00:04:38.250
"I've already got something
that's a little puzzling.",00:04:38.250,00:04:39.630
"Now I'm focusing on
the weird spot.",00:04:39.630,00:04:41.250
"Yes, another question.",00:04:41.250,00:04:41.590
"STUDENT: Wouldn't it be
a little less than 0?",00:04:41.590,00:04:49.110
"PROFESSOR: Wouldn't it be
a little less than 0?",00:04:49.110,00:04:49.610
"OK, that's a very good point
and this is a matter of",00:04:49.610,00:04:51.180
notation here.,00:04:51.180,00:04:53.310
And a matter of parentheses.,00:04:53.310,00:04:55.690
"So wouldn't this be a
little less than 2.",00:04:55.690,00:04:57.430
"Well, if the parentheses were
this way; that is, 2+ , with a",00:04:57.430,00:05:02.100
"- after I did the 2+ , then
it would be less.",00:05:02.100,00:05:06.790
But it's this way.,00:05:06.790,00:05:09.830
OK.,00:05:09.830,00:05:10.670
"So the notation is, you
have a number and you",00:05:10.670,00:05:15.950
take the part of it.,00:05:15.950,00:05:17.190
"That's the part which is a
little bit bigger than it.",00:05:17.190,00:05:21.550
And so this is what I mean.,00:05:21.550,00:05:26.840
"And if you like, here I can put
in those parentheses too.",00:05:26.840,00:05:29.870
"Yeah, another question.",00:05:29.870,00:05:31.270
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:05:31.270,00:05:34.730
"PROFESSOR: Why doesn't the
top one have a plus?",00:05:34.730,00:05:39.190
"The only reason why the top
one doesn't have a plus is",00:05:39.190,00:05:39.389
"that I don't need it
to evaluate this.",00:05:39.389,00:05:42.860
"And when I take the limit, I
can just plug in the value.",00:05:42.860,00:05:45.410
"Whereas here, I'm
still uncertain.",00:05:45.410,00:05:48.250
Because it's going to be 0.,00:05:48.250,00:05:49.430
"And I want to know which
side of 0 it's on.",00:05:49.430,00:05:51.740
"Whether it's on the positive
side or the negative side.",00:05:51.740,00:05:55.190
"So this one, I could have
written here a parentheses 2+,",00:05:55.190,00:05:58.310
"but then it would have just
simplified to - 1.",00:05:58.310,00:06:01.410
In the limit.,00:06:01.410,00:06:04.410
"So now, I've got a negative
number divided by a tiny",00:06:04.410,00:06:08.100
positive number.,00:06:08.100,00:06:10.100
"And so, somebody want to
tell me what that is?",00:06:10.100,00:06:11.940
Negative infinity.,00:06:11.940,00:06:16.750
"So, we just evaluated this
function from one side.",00:06:16.750,00:06:21.460
"And if you follow through the
other side, so this one here,",00:06:21.460,00:06:29.190
"you get something very similar,
except that this",00:06:29.190,00:06:31.140
"should be -- whoops, what
did I do wrong?",00:06:31.140,00:06:34.120
I meant this.,00:06:34.120,00:06:37.690
"I want it -2 the same base
point, but I want",00:06:37.690,00:06:40.810
to go from the left.,00:06:40.810,00:06:43.750
"So that's going to be -
2 + 1, same numerator.",00:06:43.750,00:06:47.780
"And then this - 2 on the left +
2, and that's going to come",00:06:47.780,00:06:52.540
"out to be - 1 / 0 -, which
is plus infinity.",00:06:52.540,00:07:00.670
"Or just plain infinity,
we don't have to",00:07:00.670,00:07:02.348
put the plus sign.,00:07:02.348,00:07:10.520
"So this is the first part
of the problem.",00:07:10.520,00:07:13.090
"And the second piece, to get
ourselves started, you could",00:07:13.090,00:07:16.630
"evaluate this function
at any point.",00:07:16.630,00:07:18.260
"This is just the most
interesting point, alright?",00:07:18.260,00:07:21.340
"This is just the most
interesting",00:07:21.340,00:07:22.550
place to evaluate it.,00:07:22.550,00:07:25.270
"Now, the next thing that I'd
like to do is to pay attention",00:07:25.270,00:07:28.130
to the ends.,00:07:28.130,00:07:32.130
"And I haven't really said
what the ends are.",00:07:32.130,00:07:34.290
"So the ends are just all the
way to the left and all the",00:07:34.290,00:07:37.290
way to the right.,00:07:37.290,00:07:37.940
"So that means x going to
plus or minus infinity.",00:07:37.940,00:07:42.670
"So that's the second thing I
want to pay attention to.",00:07:42.670,00:07:44.430
"Again, this is a little bit
like a video screen here.",00:07:44.430,00:07:49.450
"And we're about to discover
something that's really off",00:07:49.450,00:07:52.720
"the screen, in both cases.",00:07:52.720,00:07:55.750
"We're taking care of what's
happening way to the left, way",00:07:55.750,00:07:58.070
"to the right, here.",00:07:58.070,00:07:59.360
"And up above, we just took
care what happens",00:07:59.360,00:08:01.820
way up and way down.,00:08:01.820,00:08:05.280
"So on these ends, I need to
do some more analysis.",00:08:05.280,00:08:11.550
"Which is related to a
precalculus skill which is",00:08:11.550,00:08:15.760
evaluating limits.,00:08:15.760,00:08:18.310
"And here, the way to do it is
to divide by x the numerator",00:08:18.310,00:08:21.950
and denominator.,00:08:21.950,00:08:23.010
"Write it as (1 + 1
/ x)/ (1 + 2 /x).",00:08:23.010,00:08:27.360
"And then you can see what
happens as x goes to plus or",00:08:27.360,00:08:30.250
minus infinity.,00:08:30.250,00:08:30.980
It just goes to 1.,00:08:30.980,00:08:33.590
"So, no matter whether x is
positive or negative.",00:08:33.590,00:08:37.690
"When it gets huge, these two
extra numbers here go to 0.",00:08:37.690,00:08:42.810
"And so, this tends to 1.",00:08:42.810,00:08:44.550
"So if you like, you could
abbreviate this as f (+ or -",00:08:44.550,00:08:48.450
infinity) = 1.,00:08:48.450,00:08:52.830
"So now, I get to draw this.",00:08:52.830,00:08:54.610
"And we draw this using
asymptotes.",00:08:54.610,00:08:56.900
"So there's a level
which is y = 1.",00:08:56.900,00:09:01.800
"And then there's another
line to draw.",00:09:01.800,00:09:06.790
Which is x = - 2.,00:09:06.790,00:09:15.190
"And now, what information
do I have so far?",00:09:15.190,00:09:18.520
"Well, the information that I
have so far is that when we're",00:09:18.520,00:09:21.260
"coming in from the right, that's
to - 2, it plunges down",00:09:21.260,00:09:27.760
to minus infinity.,00:09:27.760,00:09:28.570
So that's down like this.,00:09:28.570,00:09:33.170
"And I also know that it goes
up to infinity on the other",00:09:33.170,00:09:38.810
side of the asymptote.,00:09:38.810,00:09:41.850
"And over here, I know it's
going out to the level 1.",00:09:41.850,00:09:48.130
"And here it's also going
to the level 1.",00:09:48.130,00:09:53.410
"Now, there's an issue.",00:09:53.410,00:09:57.160
"I can almost finish
this graph now.",00:09:57.160,00:09:59.490
"I almost have enough information
to finish it.",00:09:59.490,00:10:01.460
"But there's one thing
which is making me",00:10:01.460,00:10:03.890
hesitate a little bit.,00:10:03.890,00:10:06.780
"And that is, I don't know, for
instance, over here, whether",00:10:06.780,00:10:10.600
"it's going to maybe dip below
and come back up.",00:10:10.600,00:10:14.230
Or not.,00:10:14.230,00:10:16.930
So what does it do here?,00:10:16.930,00:10:20.140
Can anybody see?,00:10:20.140,00:10:25.040
Yeah.,00:10:25.040,00:10:25.250
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:10:25.250,00:10:29.900
"PROFESSOR: It can't dip
below because there",00:10:29.900,00:10:32.220
are no critical points.,00:10:32.220,00:10:32.380
"What a precisely
correct answer.",00:10:32.380,00:10:34.540
So that's exactly right.,00:10:34.540,00:10:36.730
"The point here is that because
f' is not 0, it can't double",00:10:36.730,00:10:44.260
back on itself.,00:10:44.260,00:10:45.020
"Because there can't be any of
these horizontal tangents.",00:10:45.020,00:10:49.790
"It can't double back, so
it can't backtrack.",00:10:49.790,00:11:00.560
"So sorry, if f' is not
0, f can't backtrack.",00:11:00.560,00:11:07.190
"And so that means that it
doesn't look like this.",00:11:07.190,00:11:09.410
It just goes like this.,00:11:09.410,00:11:14.320
So that's basically it.,00:11:14.320,00:11:15.690
"And it's practically the
end of the problem.",00:11:15.690,00:11:17.630
Goes like this.,00:11:17.630,00:11:19.500
"Now you can decorate
your thing, right?",00:11:19.500,00:11:21.870
"You may notice that maybe it
crosses here, the axes, you",00:11:21.870,00:11:24.540
"can actually evaluate
these places.",00:11:24.540,00:11:26.790
And so forth.,00:11:26.790,00:11:27.500
"We're looking right now for
qualitative behavior.",00:11:27.500,00:11:31.130
"In fact, you can see where
these places hit.",00:11:31.130,00:11:34.280
"And it's actually a little
higher up than I drew.",00:11:34.280,00:11:36.660
Maybe I'll draw it accurately.,00:11:36.660,00:11:40.140
As we'll see in a second.,00:11:40.140,00:11:44.970
"So that's what happens
to this function.",00:11:44.970,00:11:47.710
"Now, let's just take a look in
a little bit more detail, by",00:11:47.710,00:11:51.990
double checking.,00:11:51.990,00:11:56.840
"So we're just going to double
check what happens to the sign",00:11:56.840,00:11:58.990
of the derivative.,00:11:58.990,00:12:01.280
"And in the meantime, I'm going
to explain to you what the",00:12:01.280,00:12:03.830
"derivative is and also talk
about the second derivative.",00:12:03.830,00:12:07.045
"So first of all, the trick for
evaluating the derivative is",00:12:07.045,00:12:12.070
an algebraic one.,00:12:12.070,00:12:13.570
"I mean, obviously you can do
this by the quotient rule.",00:12:13.570,00:12:16.080
"But I just point out that this
is the same thing as this.",00:12:16.080,00:12:24.250
"And now it has, whoops, that
should be a 2 in the",00:12:24.250,00:12:27.650
denominator.,00:12:27.650,00:12:28.690
"And so, now this has the
form 1 - (1 / x + 2).",00:12:28.690,00:12:35.950
"So this makes it easy to see
what the derivative is.",00:12:35.950,00:12:39.600
"Because the derivative of
a constant is 0, right?",00:12:39.600,00:12:42.730
"So this is, derivative,
is just going to",00:12:42.730,00:12:46.640
"be, switch the sign.",00:12:46.640,00:12:49.300
This is what I wrote before.,00:12:49.300,00:12:53.410
And that explains it.,00:12:53.410,00:12:55.230
"But incidentally, it
also shows you that",00:12:55.230,00:12:57.940
that this is a hyperbola.,00:12:57.940,00:13:04.890
"These are just two curves
of a hyperbola.",00:13:04.890,00:13:09.620
"So now, let's check the sign.",00:13:09.620,00:13:12.240
"It's already totally obvious
to us that this is just a",00:13:12.240,00:13:15.290
double check.,00:13:15.290,00:13:15.940
"We didn't actually even have to
pay any attention to this.",00:13:15.940,00:13:18.710
It had better be true.,00:13:18.710,00:13:19.790
"This is just going to check
our arithmetic.",00:13:19.790,00:13:22.220
"Namely, it's increasing here.",00:13:22.220,00:13:24.570
It's increasing there.,00:13:24.570,00:13:26.610
That's got to be true.,00:13:26.610,00:13:27.830
"And, sure enough, this is
positive, as you can see it's",00:13:27.830,00:13:31.620
1 over a square.,00:13:31.620,00:13:32.930
So it is increasing.,00:13:32.930,00:13:34.070
So we checked it.,00:13:34.070,00:13:35.630
"But now, there's one more thing
that I want to just have",00:13:35.630,00:13:39.370
you watch out about.,00:13:39.370,00:13:40.720
"So this means that
f is increasing.",00:13:40.720,00:13:46.980
"On the interval minus infinity
&lt; x &lt; - 2.",00:13:46.980,00:13:51.830
"And also from - 2 all the
way out to infinity.",00:13:51.830,00:13:56.700
"So I just want to warn you, you
cannot say, don't say f is",00:13:56.700,00:14:03.360
"increasing on minus infinity
&lt; infinity, for all x.",00:14:03.360,00:14:12.020
"OK, this is just not true.",00:14:12.020,00:14:15.090
"I've written it on the board,
but it's wrong.",00:14:15.090,00:14:16.700
I'd better get rid of it.,00:14:16.700,00:14:18.660
There it is.,00:14:18.660,00:14:19.200
Get rid of it.,00:14:19.200,00:14:20.970
"And the reason is, so first of
all it's totally obvious.",00:14:20.970,00:14:24.555
It's going up here.,00:14:24.555,00:14:25.390
"But then it went zooming
back down there.",00:14:25.390,00:14:28.700
"And here this was true, but
only if x is not - 2.",00:14:28.700,00:14:35.860
So there's a break.,00:14:35.860,00:14:37.400
"And you've got to pay attention
to the break.",00:14:37.400,00:14:39.280
"So basically, the moral here
is that if you ignore this",00:14:39.280,00:14:50.510
"place, it's like ignoring
Mount Everest,",00:14:50.510,00:14:53.050
or the Grand Canyon.,00:14:53.050,00:14:54.390
"You're ignoring the most
important feature of this",00:14:54.390,00:14:56.930
function here.,00:14:56.930,00:14:58.300
"If you're going to be figuring
out where things are going up",00:14:58.300,00:15:00.510
"and down, which is basically all
we're doing, you'd better",00:15:00.510,00:15:03.710
"pay attention to these
kinds of places.",00:15:03.710,00:15:07.330
So don't ignore them.,00:15:07.330,00:15:09.330
So that's the first remark.,00:15:09.330,00:15:13.140
"And now there's just a little
bit of decoration as well.",00:15:13.140,00:15:17.340
"Which is the role of the
second derivative.",00:15:17.340,00:15:19.990
"So we've written down the
first derivative here.",00:15:19.990,00:15:21.990
"The second derivative is now
- 2 / (x + 2)^3, right?",00:15:21.990,00:15:33.490
"So I get that from
differentiating this formula",00:15:33.490,00:15:35.942
"up here for the first
derivative.",00:15:35.942,00:15:39.490
"And now, of course, that's also,
only works for x not",00:15:39.490,00:15:43.825
equal to - 2.,00:15:43.825,00:15:47.680
"And now, we can see that this is
going to be negative, let's",00:15:47.680,00:15:54.820
"see, where is it negative?",00:15:54.820,00:15:56.650
"When this is a positive
quantity, so when -2 &lt; x",00:15:56.650,00:16:02.680
&lt; infinity.,00:16:02.680,00:16:03.405
It's negative.,00:16:03.405,00:16:04.590
"And this is where this thing
is concave. Let's see.",00:16:04.590,00:16:08.670
Did I say that right?,00:16:08.670,00:16:12.650
"Negative, right?",00:16:12.650,00:16:13.330
This is concave down.,00:16:13.330,00:16:19.180
Right.,00:16:19.180,00:16:19.930
"And similarly, if I look at this
expression, the numerator",00:16:19.930,00:16:23.400
"is always negative but the
denominator becomes negative",00:16:23.400,00:16:28.180
as well when x &lt; -2.,00:16:28.180,00:16:31.130
So this becomes positive.,00:16:31.130,00:16:33.710
"So this case, it was negative
over positive.",00:16:33.710,00:16:36.690
"In this case it was negative
divided by negative.",00:16:36.690,00:16:40.950
"So here, this is in the range
- infinity &lt; x &lt; -2.",00:16:40.950,00:16:46.140
And here it's concave up.,00:16:46.140,00:16:52.240
"Now, again, this is just
consistent with what we're",00:16:52.240,00:16:55.310
already guessing.,00:16:55.310,00:16:55.920
"Of course we already know it in
this case if we know that",00:16:55.920,00:16:57.910
this is a hyperbola.,00:16:57.910,00:16:59.680
"That it's going to be concave
down to the right of the",00:16:59.680,00:17:02.310
"vertical line, dotted
vertical line.",00:17:02.310,00:17:04.270
And concave up to the left.,00:17:04.270,00:17:07.770
"So what extra piece of
information is it that",00:17:07.770,00:17:11.910
this is giving us?,00:17:11.910,00:17:16.100
Did I say this backwards?,00:17:16.100,00:17:17.800
No.,00:17:17.800,00:17:18.520
That's OK.,00:17:18.520,00:17:19.570
"So what extra piece of
information is this giving us?",00:17:19.570,00:17:21.430
"It looks like it's giving
us hardly anything.",00:17:21.430,00:17:23.400
"And it really is giving
us hardly anything.",00:17:23.400,00:17:25.680
"But it is giving us something
that's a little aesthetic.",00:17:25.680,00:17:28.840
"It's ruling out the possibility
of a wiggle.",00:17:28.840,00:17:34.280
"There isn't anything like
that in the curve.",00:17:34.280,00:17:37.590
"It can't shift from curving this
way to curving that way",00:17:37.590,00:17:40.412
to curving this way.,00:17:40.412,00:17:41.590
That doesn't happen.,00:17:41.590,00:17:42.860
"So these properties say
there's no wiggle in",00:17:42.860,00:17:48.723
the graph of that.,00:17:48.723,00:17:59.070
Alright.,00:17:59.070,00:17:59.790
So.,00:17:59.790,00:18:01.410
Question.,00:18:01.410,00:18:01.890
"STUDENT: Do we define the
increasing and decreasing base",00:18:01.890,00:18:05.570
"purely on the derivative, or
the sort of more general",00:18:05.570,00:18:10.630
"definition of picking any
two points and seeing.",00:18:10.630,00:18:14.310
"Because sometimes there can be
an inconsistency between the",00:18:14.310,00:18:17.530
two definitions.,00:18:17.530,00:18:20.300
"PROFESSOR: OK, so the question
is, in this course are we",00:18:20.300,00:18:26.300
"going to define positive
derivative as being the same",00:18:26.300,00:18:29.770
thing as increasing.,00:18:29.770,00:18:31.360
And the answer is no.,00:18:31.360,00:18:33.030
"We'll try to use these
terms separately.",00:18:33.030,00:18:36.210
"What's always true is that if
f' is positive, then f is",00:18:36.210,00:18:41.780
increasing.,00:18:41.780,00:18:42.530
"But the reverse is not
necessarily true.",00:18:42.530,00:18:45.060
"It could be very flat, the
derivative can be 0 and still",00:18:45.060,00:18:47.790
"the function can
be increasing.",00:18:47.790,00:18:50.050
"OK, the derivative can
be 0 at a few places.",00:18:50.050,00:18:53.730
"For instance, like
some cubics.",00:18:53.730,00:18:59.300
Other questions?,00:18:59.300,00:19:05.370
"So that's as much as I need
to say in general.",00:19:05.370,00:19:09.860
"I mean, in a specific case.",00:19:09.860,00:19:11.390
"But I want to get you a general
scheme and I want to",00:19:11.390,00:19:13.670
"go through a more complicated
example that gets all the",00:19:13.670,00:19:17.080
"features of this
kind of thing.",00:19:17.080,00:19:22.750
"So let's talk about a general
strategy for sketching.",00:19:22.750,00:19:34.710
"So the first part of
this strategy, if",00:19:34.710,00:19:38.600
"you like, let's see.",00:19:38.600,00:19:40.800
"I have it all plotted
out here.",00:19:40.800,00:19:42.430
"So I'm going to make sure I
get it exactly the way I",00:19:42.430,00:19:46.200
wanted you to see.,00:19:46.200,00:19:47.780
"So I have, its plotting.",00:19:47.780,00:19:51.440
The plot thickens.,00:19:51.440,00:19:52.720
Here we go.,00:19:52.720,00:19:54.040
"So plot, what is it that
you should plot first?",00:19:54.040,00:19:57.710
"Before you even think about
derivatives, you should plot",00:19:57.710,00:20:02.710
discontinuities.,00:20:02.710,00:20:08.250
Especially the infinite ones.,00:20:08.250,00:20:18.490
"That's the first thing
you should do.",00:20:18.490,00:20:20.210
"And then, you should plot
end points, for ends.",00:20:20.210,00:20:27.160
"For x going to plus or minus
infinity if there don't happen",00:20:27.160,00:20:31.720
"to be any finite ends
to the problem.",00:20:31.720,00:20:35.640
"And the third thing you can do
is plot any easy points.",00:20:35.640,00:20:44.600
This is optional.,00:20:44.600,00:20:49.000
At your discretion.,00:20:49.000,00:20:50.710
"You might, for instance, on this
example, plot the places",00:20:50.710,00:20:54.920
"where the graph crosses
the axis.",00:20:54.920,00:20:59.550
If you want to.,00:20:59.550,00:21:04.540
So that's the first part.,00:21:04.540,00:21:05.810
"And again, this is
all precalculus.",00:21:05.810,00:21:08.190
"So now, in the second part
we're going to solve this",00:21:08.190,00:21:17.230
"equation and we're
going to plot the",00:21:17.230,00:21:21.030
critical points and values.,00:21:21.030,00:21:29.360
"In the problem which we just
discussed, there weren't any.",00:21:29.360,00:21:32.810
So this part was empty.,00:21:32.810,00:21:38.640
"So the third step is to decide
whether f', sorry, whether, f'",00:21:38.640,00:21:50.200
"is positive or negative
on each interval.",00:21:50.200,00:22:01.120
"Between critical points,
discontinuities.",00:22:01.120,00:22:17.210
"The direction of the sign, in
this case it doesn't change.",00:22:17.210,00:22:22.560
"It goes up here and it
also goes up here.",00:22:22.560,00:22:24.900
"But it could go up here and
then come back down.",00:22:24.900,00:22:27.770
"So the direction can change
at every critical point.",00:22:27.770,00:22:31.460
"It can change at every
discontinuity.",00:22:31.460,00:22:33.850
And you don't know.,00:22:33.850,00:22:35.350
"However, this particular step
has to be consistent with 1",00:22:35.350,00:22:44.520
"and 2, with steps 1 and 2.",00:22:44.520,00:22:47.230
"In fact, it will never, if you
can succeed in doing steps 1",00:22:47.230,00:22:53.205
"and 2, you'll never
need step 3.",00:22:53.205,00:22:56.970
"All it's doing is
double-checking.",00:22:56.970,00:23:02.190
"So if you made an arithmetic
mistake somewhere, you'll be",00:23:02.190,00:23:06.140
able to see it.,00:23:06.140,00:23:09.160
"So that's maybe the most
important thing.",00:23:09.160,00:23:10.870
"And it's actually the most
frustrating thing for me when",00:23:10.870,00:23:13.220
"I see people working on
problems, is they start step",00:23:13.220,00:23:16.760
"3, they get it wrong, and then
they start trying to draw the",00:23:16.760,00:23:20.790
graph and it doesn't work.,00:23:20.790,00:23:22.480
Because it's inconsistent.,00:23:22.480,00:23:23.620
"And the reason is some
arithmetic error with the",00:23:23.620,00:23:26.280
"derivative or something like
that or some other",00:23:26.280,00:23:28.300
misinterpretation.,00:23:28.300,00:23:29.880
And then there's a total mess.,00:23:29.880,00:23:31.930
"If you start with these two
steps, then you're going to",00:23:31.930,00:23:35.040
"know when you get to this step
that you're making mistakes.",00:23:35.040,00:23:37.620
"People don't generally make
as many mistakes in",00:23:37.620,00:23:40.720
the first two steps.,00:23:40.720,00:23:42.360
"Anyway, in fact you can skip
this step if you want.",00:23:42.360,00:23:45.220
"But that's at risk of not
double-checking your work.",00:23:45.220,00:23:49.470
So what's the fourth step?,00:23:49.470,00:23:51.280
"Well, we take a look
at whether f''",00:23:51.280,00:23:56.180
is positive or negative.,00:23:56.180,00:23:59.400
"And so we're deciding on things
like whether it's",00:23:59.400,00:24:01.890
concave up or down.,00:24:01.890,00:24:07.640
"And we have these points, f''
( x ) = 0, which are called",00:24:07.640,00:24:16.670
inflection points.,00:24:16.670,00:24:24.570
"And the last step is just
to combine everything.",00:24:24.570,00:24:31.550
"So this is this the scheme,
the general scheme.",00:24:31.550,00:24:35.710
"And let's just carry it out
in a particular case.",00:24:35.710,00:24:58.850
"So here's the function
that I'm going",00:24:58.850,00:25:00.225
to use as an example.,00:25:00.225,00:25:02.280
I'll use f ( x ) = x / ln x.,00:25:02.280,00:25:08.250
"And because the logarithm
- yeah, question.",00:25:08.250,00:25:11.640
Yeah.,00:25:11.640,00:25:11.960
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:25:11.960,00:25:18.660
"PROFESSOR: The question
is, is this optional.",00:25:18.660,00:25:21.350
So that's a good question.,00:25:21.350,00:25:25.570
Is this optional.,00:25:25.570,00:25:26.390
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:25:26.390,00:25:31.516
"PROFESSOR: OK, the question
is is this optional;",00:25:31.516,00:25:37.590
this kind of question.,00:25:37.590,00:25:38.660
"And the answer is, it's more
than just -- so, in many",00:25:38.660,00:25:49.100
"instances, I'm not going
to ask you to.",00:25:49.100,00:25:51.700
"I strongly recommend that if I
don't ask you to do it, that",00:25:51.700,00:25:55.390
you not try.,00:25:55.390,00:25:57.050
"Because it's usually awful to
find the second derivative.",00:25:57.050,00:26:01.050
"Any time you can get away
without computing a second",00:26:01.050,00:26:03.290
"derivative, you're better off.",00:26:03.290,00:26:06.330
"So in many, many instances.",00:26:06.330,00:26:07.920
"On the other hand, if I ask you
to do it it's because I",00:26:07.920,00:26:10.500
"want you to have the,
work to do it.",00:26:10.500,00:26:13.060
"But basically, if nobody forces
you to, I would say",00:26:13.060,00:26:16.950
never do step 4.,00:26:16.950,00:26:22.130
Other questions.,00:26:22.130,00:26:26.750
Alright.,00:26:26.750,00:26:27.610
"So we're going to force
ourselves to do step 4,",00:26:27.610,00:26:29.950
"however, in this instance.",00:26:29.950,00:26:31.810
"But maybe this will be
one of the few times.",00:26:31.810,00:26:35.010
"So here we go, just for
illustrative purposes.",00:26:35.010,00:26:39.140
"OK, now.",00:26:39.140,00:26:43.240
"So here's the function that
I want to discuss.",00:26:43.240,00:26:46.140
"And the range has to be x
positive, because the",00:26:46.140,00:26:50.010
"logarithm is not defined
for negative values.",00:26:50.010,00:26:55.500
"So the first thing that I'm
going to do is, I'd like to",00:26:55.500,00:26:58.850
follow the scheme here.,00:26:58.850,00:27:02.560
"Because if I don't follow the
scheme, I'm going to get a",00:27:02.560,00:27:05.450
little mixed up.,00:27:05.450,00:27:06.490
"So the first part is to find
the singularities.",00:27:06.490,00:27:13.980
"That is, the places where
f is infinite.",00:27:13.980,00:27:17.060
"And that's when the logarithm,
the denominator, vanishes.",00:27:17.060,00:27:20.720
"So that's f ( 1 +),
if you like.",00:27:20.720,00:27:25.630
"So that's 1 / ln 1 +, which is
1 / 0, with a little bit of",00:27:25.630,00:27:32.620
positiveness to it.,00:27:32.620,00:27:34.280
Which is infinity.,00:27:34.280,00:27:37.270
"And second, we do it
the other way.",00:27:37.270,00:27:39.830
"And not surprisingly,
this comes out",00:27:39.830,00:27:41.690
to be negative infinity.,00:27:41.690,00:27:46.850
"Now, the next thing I want
to do is the ends.",00:27:46.850,00:27:51.980
So I call these the ends.,00:27:51.980,00:27:56.980
And there are two of them.,00:27:56.980,00:28:01.380
"One of them is f ( 0 ) from
the right. f ( 0+).",00:28:01.380,00:28:08.300
"So that is 0 + / ln 0 +, which
is 0 plus divided by, well, ln",00:28:08.300,00:28:21.490
"0 + is actually minus
infinity.",00:28:21.490,00:28:25.360
"That's what happens
to the logarithm,",00:28:25.360,00:28:26.940
goes to minus infinity.,00:28:26.940,00:28:28.170
"So this is 0 over infinity,
which is definitely 0, there's",00:28:28.170,00:28:31.250
"no problem. about
what happens.",00:28:31.250,00:28:37.100
"The other side, so this is the
end, this is the first end.",00:28:37.100,00:28:42.910
The range is this.,00:28:42.910,00:28:44.920
"And I just did the
left endpoint.",00:28:44.920,00:28:48.480
"And so now I have to do the
right endpoint, I have to let",00:28:48.480,00:28:50.850
x go to infinity.,00:28:50.850,00:28:51.870
"So if I let x go to infinity,
I'm just going to have to",00:28:51.870,00:28:54.350
"think about it a little
bit by plugging in",00:28:54.350,00:28:56.200
a very large number.,00:28:56.200,00:28:57.690
"I'll plug in 10 ^ 10, just
to see what happens.",00:28:57.690,00:29:01.960
"So if I plug in 10 ^ 10
into x ln x, I get",00:29:01.960,00:29:05.410
10 ^ 10 / ln 10^10.,00:29:05.410,00:29:11.730
"Which is 10 ^ 10
/ 10 ( log 10).",00:29:11.730,00:29:17.590
"So the denominator, this
number here, is about",00:29:17.590,00:29:20.520
2.something.,00:29:20.520,00:29:23.180
2.3 or something.,00:29:23.180,00:29:25.130
"So this is maybe 230 in the
denominator, and this is a",00:29:25.130,00:29:28.310
number with ten 0's after it.,00:29:28.310,00:29:31.900
"So it's very, very large.",00:29:31.900,00:29:33.530
I claim it's big.,00:29:33.530,00:29:35.300
"And that gives us the clue that
what's happening is that",00:29:35.300,00:29:39.040
this thing is infinite.,00:29:39.040,00:29:40.540
"So, in other words, our
conclusion is that f of",00:29:40.540,00:29:43.766
infinity is infinity.,00:29:43.766,00:29:52.120
"So what do we have so far
for our function?",00:29:52.120,00:29:59.650
"We're just trying to build the
scaffolding of the function.",00:29:59.650,00:30:03.300
"And we're doing it by taking
the most important points.",00:30:03.300,00:30:07.270
"And from a mathematician's
point of view, the most",00:30:07.270,00:30:09.520
"important points are the
ones which are sort",00:30:09.520,00:30:11.250
of infinitely obvious.,00:30:11.250,00:30:13.490
For the ends of the problem.,00:30:13.490,00:30:15.190
So that's where we're heading.,00:30:15.190,00:30:19.730
"We have a vertical asymptote,
which is at x = 1.",00:30:19.730,00:30:22.600
So this gives us x = 1.,00:30:22.600,00:30:29.150
"And we have a value which
is that it's 0 here.",00:30:29.150,00:30:34.270
"And we also know that when we
come in from the - sorry, so",00:30:34.270,00:30:38.850
"we come in from the left, that's
f, the one from the",00:30:38.850,00:30:44.716
"left, we get negative
infinity.",00:30:44.716,00:30:46.060
So it's diving down.,00:30:46.060,00:30:47.550
It's going down like this.,00:30:47.550,00:30:52.460
"And, furthermore, on the other
side we know it's climbing up.",00:30:52.460,00:30:55.925
So it's going up like this.,00:30:55.925,00:30:58.560
Just start a little higher.,00:30:58.560,00:31:00.460
"Right, so.",00:31:00.460,00:31:00.770
"So far, this is what we know.",00:31:00.770,00:31:02.520
"Oh, and there's one other
thing that we know.",00:31:02.520,00:31:05.810
"When we go to plus infinity,
it's going back up.",00:31:05.810,00:31:12.420
"So, so far we have this.",00:31:12.420,00:31:15.150
"Now, already it should be pretty
obvious what's going to",00:31:15.150,00:31:17.950
happen to this function.,00:31:17.950,00:31:19.760
"So there shouldn't be
many surprises.",00:31:19.760,00:31:21.160
"It's going to come
down like this.",00:31:21.160,00:31:23.160
"Go like this, it's going to turn
around and go back up.",00:31:23.160,00:31:27.090
That's what we expect.,00:31:27.090,00:31:29.290
"So we don't know that yet,
but we're pretty sure.",00:31:29.290,00:31:33.600
"So at this point, we can
start looking at",00:31:33.600,00:31:35.890
the critical points.,00:31:35.890,00:31:36.800
"We can do our step 2 here -- we
need a little bit more room",00:31:36.800,00:31:41.994
"here -- and see what's happening
with this function.",00:31:41.994,00:31:45.490
So I have to differentiate it.,00:31:45.490,00:31:49.220
"And it's, this is the
quotient rule.",00:31:49.220,00:31:52.070
"So remember the function
is up here, x / ln x.",00:31:52.070,00:31:54.880
"So I have a ln x^2 in
the denominator.",00:31:54.880,00:31:59.400
"And I get here the derivative of
x is 1, so we get 1 ( ln x)",00:31:59.400,00:32:04.190
"- x ( the derivative of
ln x, which is 1 /x).",00:32:04.190,00:32:10.560
"So all told, that's (ln
x - 1) / ln x^2.",00:32:10.560,00:32:20.160
So here's our derivative.,00:32:20.160,00:32:27.770
"And now, if I set this equal
to 0, at least in the",00:32:27.770,00:32:34.520
"numerator, the numerator
is 0 when x = e.",00:32:34.520,00:32:40.970
The ln e = 1.,00:32:40.970,00:32:43.490
So here's our critical point.,00:32:43.490,00:32:46.290
"And we have a critical
value, which is f(e).",00:32:46.290,00:32:51.320
"And that's going
to be e / ln e.",00:32:51.320,00:32:55.610
"Which is e, again.",00:32:55.610,00:32:57.240
Because ln e = 1.,00:32:57.240,00:32:59.090
"So now I can also plot
the critical point,",00:32:59.090,00:33:01.890
which is down here.,00:33:01.890,00:33:03.110
"And there's only one of them,
and it's at (e e).",00:33:03.110,00:33:07.680
"That's kind of not to scale
here, because my blackboard",00:33:07.680,00:33:10.800
isn't quite tall enough.,00:33:10.800,00:33:12.520
"It should be over here and
then, it's slope 1.",00:33:12.520,00:33:15.360
But I dipped it down.,00:33:15.360,00:33:17.140
"So this is not to scale, and
indeed that's one of the",00:33:17.140,00:33:19.300
"things that we're not going to
attempt to do with these",00:33:19.300,00:33:22.240
"pictures, is to make
them to scale.",00:33:22.240,00:33:24.680
"So the scale's a little
squashed.",00:33:24.680,00:33:29.560
"So, so far I have this
critical point.",00:33:29.560,00:33:32.710
"And, in fact, I'm going
to label it with a c.",00:33:32.710,00:33:36.180
"Whenever I have a critical point
I'll just make sure that",00:33:36.180,00:33:38.560
"I remember that that's
what it is.",00:33:38.560,00:33:41.490
"And since there's only one, the
rest of this picture is",00:33:41.490,00:33:45.450
now correct.,00:33:45.450,00:33:49.900
"That's the same mechanism that
we used for the hyperbola.",00:33:49.900,00:33:54.880
"Namely, we know there's only
one place where the",00:33:54.880,00:33:57.290
derivative is 0.,00:33:57.290,00:33:57.810
"So that means there no more
horizontals, so there's no",00:33:57.810,00:34:00.550
more backtracking.,00:34:00.550,00:34:01.950
It has to come down to here.,00:34:01.950,00:34:03.330
Get to there.,00:34:03.330,00:34:03.970
"This is the only place
it can turn around.",00:34:03.970,00:34:06.060
Goes back up.,00:34:06.060,00:34:07.170
"It has to start here and it
has to go down to there.",00:34:07.170,00:34:09.000
It can't go above 0.,00:34:09.000,00:34:10.600
"Do not pass go, do
not get positive.",00:34:10.600,00:34:13.600
It has to head down here.,00:34:13.600,00:34:20.230
So that's great.,00:34:20.230,00:34:21.690
"That means that this
picture is almost",00:34:21.690,00:34:23.460
completely correct now.,00:34:23.460,00:34:25.080
"And the rest is more
or less decoration.",00:34:25.080,00:34:27.520
"We're pretty much done with
the way it looks, at least",00:34:27.520,00:34:30.590
schematically.,00:34:30.590,00:34:34.570
"However, I am going to punish
you, because I warned you.",00:34:34.570,00:34:37.700
"We are going to go over here and
do this step 4 and fix up",00:34:37.700,00:34:41.140
the concavity.,00:34:41.140,00:34:44.280
"And we're also going to do
a little bit of that",00:34:44.280,00:34:46.180
double-checking.,00:34:46.180,00:35:00.770
"So now, let's again, just,
I want to emphasize.",00:35:00.770,00:35:06.130
"We're going to do
a double-check.",00:35:06.130,00:35:10.660
This is part 3.,00:35:10.660,00:35:12.240
"But in advance, I already have,
based on this picture I",00:35:12.240,00:35:17.110
"already know what
has to be true.",00:35:17.110,00:35:19.000
"That f is decreasing on
0 to 1. f is also",00:35:19.000,00:35:30.380
decreasing on 1 to e.,00:35:30.380,00:35:35.450
"And f is increasing
on e to infinity.",00:35:35.450,00:35:45.490
"So, already, because we've plot
a bunch of points and we",00:35:45.490,00:35:49.710
"know that there aren't any
places where the derivative",00:35:49.710,00:35:51.470
"vanishes, we already know
it goes down, down, up.",00:35:51.470,00:35:55.500
That's what it's got to do.,00:35:55.500,00:35:56.970
"Now, we'll just make sure that
we didn't make any arithmetic",00:35:56.970,00:35:59.550
"mistakes, now.",00:35:59.550,00:36:00.720
"By actually computing
the derivative, or",00:36:00.720,00:36:03.090
"staring at it, anyway.",00:36:03.090,00:36:04.650
"And making sure that
it's correct.",00:36:04.650,00:36:10.350
"So first of all, we just take
a look at the numerator.",00:36:10.350,00:36:17.600
"So f,' remember, was (ln
x - 1) / ln x^2,",00:36:17.600,00:36:26.120
the quantity squared.,00:36:26.120,00:36:26.655
"So the denominator
is positive.",00:36:26.655,00:36:28.480
"So let's just take a look
at the three ranges.",00:36:28.480,00:36:32.650
So we have 0 &lt; x &lt; 1.,00:36:32.650,00:36:37.330
"And on that range, the logarithm
is negative, so this",00:36:37.330,00:36:40.900
"is negative divided by positive,
which is negative.",00:36:40.900,00:36:45.230
"That's decreasing,
that's good.",00:36:45.230,00:36:47.220
"And in fact, that also works
on the next range.",00:36:47.220,00:36:50.160
"1 l&lt; x &lt; e, it's negative
divided by positive.",00:36:50.160,00:36:55.370
"And the only reason why we
skipped 1, again, is that it's",00:36:55.370,00:36:57.840
undefined there.,00:36:57.840,00:36:58.432
"And there's something dramatic
happening there.",00:36:58.432,00:37:01.040
"And then, at the last range,
when x is bigger than e, that",00:37:01.040,00:37:05.420
"means the logarithm is already
bigger than 1.",00:37:05.420,00:37:07.860
"So the numerator is now
positive, and the",00:37:07.860,00:37:09.726
"denominator's still positive,
so it's increasing.",00:37:09.726,00:37:13.650
"So we've just double-checked
something",00:37:13.650,00:37:15.450
that we already knew.,00:37:15.450,00:37:22.910
"Alright, so that's pretty
much all there is to",00:37:22.910,00:37:26.940
say about step 3.,00:37:26.940,00:37:29.200
"So this is checking the
positivity and negativity.",00:37:29.200,00:37:33.980
"And now, step 4.",00:37:33.980,00:37:35.660
"There is one small point
which I want to make",00:37:35.660,00:37:37.820
before we go on.,00:37:37.820,00:37:38.480
"Which is that sometimes, you
can't evaluate the function or",00:37:38.480,00:37:43.980
"its derivative particularly
well.",00:37:43.980,00:37:45.445
"So sometimes you can't plot
the points very well.",00:37:45.445,00:37:48.620
"And if you can't plot the points
very well, then you",00:37:48.620,00:37:50.410
"might have to do 3 first, to
figure out what's going on a",00:37:50.410,00:37:53.790
little bit.,00:37:53.790,00:37:55.290
You might have to skip.,00:37:55.290,00:37:59.150
"So now we're going to go on
the second derivative.",00:37:59.150,00:38:02.400
"But first, I want to use an
algebraic trick to rearrange",00:38:02.400,00:38:07.900
"the terms. And I want to notice
one more little point.",00:38:07.900,00:38:10.820
"Which I, as I say, this is
decoration for the graph.",00:38:10.820,00:38:16.320
"So I want to rewrite
the formula.",00:38:16.320,00:38:18.290
"Maybe I'll do it right
over here.",00:38:18.290,00:38:22.320
"Another way of writing this is
(1 / ln x) - (1 / (ln x)^2).",00:38:22.320,00:38:31.440
"So that's another way of
writing the derivative.",00:38:31.440,00:38:35.240
"And that allows me to
notice something",00:38:35.240,00:38:38.520
"that I missed, before.",00:38:38.520,00:38:40.830
"When I solved the equation ln
x - 1 - this is equal to 0",00:38:40.830,00:38:46.880
"here, this equation here.",00:38:46.880,00:38:48.590
I missed a possibility.,00:38:48.590,00:38:51.460
"I missed the possibility
that the",00:38:51.460,00:38:53.330
denominator could be infinity.,00:38:53.330,00:38:58.690
"So actually, if the
denominator's infinity, as you",00:38:58.690,00:39:02.180
"can see from the other
expression there, it actually",00:39:02.180,00:39:06.020
"is true that the derivative
is 0.",00:39:06.020,00:39:09.000
"So also when x = 0 +, the
slope is going to be 0.",00:39:09.000,00:39:16.710
"Let me just emphasize
that again.",00:39:16.710,00:39:19.050
"If you evaluate using this other
formula over here, this",00:39:19.050,00:39:23.740
"is (1 / ln 0+) - (1
/ (ln 0+)^2).",00:39:23.740,00:39:31.540
"That's 1 / - infinity
- 1 / infinity,",00:39:31.540,00:39:35.950
"if you like, squared.",00:39:35.950,00:39:37.310
"Anyway, it's 0.",00:39:37.310,00:39:40.630
So this is 0.,00:39:40.630,00:39:42.330
The slope is 0 there.,00:39:42.330,00:39:43.410
"That is a little piece of
decoration on our graph.",00:39:43.410,00:39:46.640
"It's telling us, going back to
our graph here, it's telling",00:39:46.640,00:39:50.810
"us this is coming in with
slope horizontal.",00:39:50.810,00:39:53.560
"So we're starting
out this way.",00:39:53.560,00:39:57.530
"That's just a little start
here to the graph.",00:39:57.530,00:40:01.013
It's a horizontal slope.,00:40:01.013,00:40:02.620
"So there really were two places
where the slope was",00:40:02.620,00:40:04.690
horizontal.,00:40:04.690,00:40:07.940
"Now, with the help of this
second formula I can also",00:40:07.940,00:40:13.550
differentiate a second time.,00:40:13.550,00:40:17.050
"So it's a little bit easier to
do that if I differentiate 1 /",00:40:17.050,00:40:19.690
"ln, that's -( ln x) ^ - 2 ( 1
/ x) + 2 (ln x) ^ -3 (1/x).",00:40:19.690,00:40:34.270
"And that, if I put it over a
common denominator, is x ln",00:40:34.270,00:40:42.150
"x^3 times, let's see here.",00:40:42.150,00:40:48.690
"I guess I'll have to
take the 2 - ln x.",00:40:48.690,00:40:55.340
"So I've now rewritten the
formula for the second",00:40:55.340,00:40:57.880
derivative as a ratio.,00:40:57.880,00:41:03.450
"Now, to decide the sign, you see
there are two places where",00:41:03.450,00:41:09.610
the sign flips.,00:41:09.610,00:41:11.910
"The numerator crosses when the
logarithm is 2, that's going",00:41:11.910,00:41:16.540
to be when x = e ^2.,00:41:16.540,00:41:18.620
"And the denominator flips when
x = 1, that's when the log",00:41:18.620,00:41:24.270
"flips from positive
to negative.",00:41:24.270,00:41:28.020
"So we have a couple
of ranges here.",00:41:28.020,00:41:32.280
"So, first of all, we have
the range from 0 to 1.",00:41:32.280,00:41:37.580
"And then we have the range
from 1 to e^2.",00:41:37.580,00:41:42.270
"And then we have the
range from e ^2 all",00:41:42.270,00:41:45.802
the way out to infinity.,00:41:45.802,00:41:49.780
"So between 0 and 1, the
numerator is, well this is a",00:41:49.780,00:41:58.640
"negative number in this, so
minus a negative number is",00:41:58.640,00:42:00.870
"positive, so the numerator
is positive.",00:42:00.870,00:42:04.650
"And the denominator is negative,
because the ln is",00:42:04.650,00:42:07.700
"negative it's taken to
the third power.",00:42:07.700,00:42:09.660
"So this is a negative numbers,
so it's positive divided by a",00:42:09.660,00:42:12.371
"negative number, which
is less than 0.",00:42:12.371,00:42:15.190
That means it's concave down.,00:42:15.190,00:42:18.770
So this is concave down plot.,00:42:18.770,00:42:26.040
"And that's a good thing, because
over here this is",00:42:26.040,00:42:28.360
concave down.,00:42:28.360,00:42:29.120
So there are no wiggles.,00:42:29.120,00:42:30.560
"It goes straight down,
like this.",00:42:30.560,00:42:34.260
"And then the other two pieces
are f'' is equal to, well it's",00:42:34.260,00:42:41.770
going to switch here.,00:42:41.770,00:42:43.260
"The denominator becomes
positive.",00:42:43.260,00:42:44.856
"So it's positive
over positive.",00:42:44.856,00:42:48.190
So this is concave up.,00:42:48.190,00:42:56.670
And that's going over here.,00:42:56.670,00:42:58.410
"But notice that it's not the
bottom where it turns around,",00:42:58.410,00:43:02.715
it's somewhere else.,00:43:02.715,00:43:07.740
"So there's another
transition here.",00:43:07.740,00:43:09.930
This is e ^2.,00:43:09.930,00:43:12.090
This is e.,00:43:12.090,00:43:15.090
"So what happens at the end is,
again, the sign flips again.",00:43:15.090,00:43:20.440
"Because the numerator,
now, when x &gt;",00:43:20.440,00:43:23.440
"e ^2, becomes negative.",00:43:23.440,00:43:26.580
And this is negative divided by,00:43:26.580,00:43:27.820
"positive, which is negative.",00:43:27.820,00:43:29.965
And part is concave down.,00:43:29.965,00:43:35.630
"And so we didn't quite
draw the graph right.",00:43:35.630,00:43:39.100
"There's an inflection point
right here, which",00:43:39.100,00:43:41.180
I'll label with i.,00:43:41.180,00:43:45.000
"Makes a turn the other
way at that point.",00:43:45.000,00:43:47.340
So there was a wiggle.,00:43:47.340,00:43:49.480
There's the wiggle.,00:43:49.480,00:43:51.210
"Still going up, still
going to infinity.",00:43:51.210,00:43:53.710
"But kind of the slope of
the mountain, right?",00:43:53.710,00:43:57.040
It's going the other way.,00:43:57.040,00:44:01.240
"This point happens to
be (e^2, e ^2 / 2).",00:44:01.240,00:44:09.350
"So that's as detailed
as we'll ever get.",00:44:09.350,00:44:11.980
"And indeed, the next game is
going to be avoid being, is to",00:44:11.980,00:44:16.910
avoid being this detailed.,00:44:16.910,00:44:18.730
"So let me introduce
the next subject.",00:44:18.730,00:44:21.760
Which is maxima and minima.,00:44:21.760,00:44:48.310
"OK, now, maxima and minima,
maximum and minimum problems",00:44:48.310,00:45:04.160
"can be described graphically
in the following ways.",00:45:04.160,00:45:06.550
"Suppose you have a function,
right, here it is.",00:45:06.550,00:45:13.150
OK?,00:45:13.150,00:45:14.420
"Now, find the maximum.",00:45:14.420,00:45:24.630
And find the minimum.,00:45:24.630,00:45:30.740
OK.,00:45:30.740,00:45:31.410
So this problem is done.,00:45:31.410,00:45:38.880
"The point being, that it is easy
to find max and the min",00:45:38.880,00:45:51.625
with the sketch.,00:45:51.625,00:45:58.670
It's very easy.,00:45:58.670,00:46:00.330
"The goal, the problem, is that
the sketch is a lot of work.",00:46:00.330,00:46:05.130
"We just spent 20 minutes
sketching something.",00:46:05.130,00:46:10.180
"We would not like to spend all
that time every single time we",00:46:10.180,00:46:13.560
"want to find a maximum
and minimum.",00:46:13.560,00:46:14.970
"So the goal is to do
it with, so our",00:46:14.970,00:46:17.950
goal is to use shortcuts.,00:46:17.950,00:46:25.170
"And, indeed, as I said earlier,
we certainly never",00:46:25.170,00:46:31.080
"want to use the second
derivative if we can avoid it.",00:46:31.080,00:46:33.840
"And we don't want to decorate
the graph and do all of these",00:46:33.840,00:46:37.270
"elaborate, subtle, things which
make the graph look",00:46:37.270,00:46:40.000
"nicer and really, or
aesthetically appropriate.",00:46:40.000,00:46:42.640
"But are totally unnecessary
to see whether the",00:46:42.640,00:46:45.640
graph is up or down.,00:46:45.640,00:46:54.290
"So essentially, this whole
business is out, which is a",00:46:54.290,00:46:58.180
good thing.,00:46:58.180,00:47:00.030
"And, unfortunately, those early
parts are the parts that",00:47:00.030,00:47:04.310
people tend to ignore.,00:47:04.310,00:47:06.170
"Which are typically, often,
very important.",00:47:06.170,00:47:10.150
"So let me first tell you
the main point here.",00:47:10.150,00:47:22.940
So the key idea.,00:47:22.940,00:47:32.760
Key to finding maximum.,00:47:32.760,00:47:39.650
"So the key point is,
we only need to",00:47:39.650,00:47:41.970
look at critical points.,00:47:41.970,00:48:00.130
"Well, that's actually what
it seems like to, in many",00:48:00.130,00:48:04.740
calculus classes.,00:48:04.740,00:48:05.490
But that's not true.,00:48:05.490,00:48:06.810
"This is not the end
of the sentence.",00:48:06.810,00:48:15.590
"And, end points, and points
of discontinuity.",00:48:15.590,00:48:35.320
"So you must watch
out for those.",00:48:35.320,00:48:37.980
"If you look at the example that
I just drew here, which",00:48:37.980,00:48:41.780
"is the one that I carried out,
you can see that there are",00:48:41.780,00:48:46.450
"actually five extreme points
on this picture.",00:48:46.450,00:48:51.250
So let's switch.,00:48:51.250,00:48:52.750
So we'll take a look.,00:48:52.750,00:48:58.050
"There are five places where the
max or the min might be.",00:48:58.050,00:49:04.840
There's this important point.,00:49:04.840,00:49:08.050
"This is, as I say, the
scaffolding of the function.",00:49:08.050,00:49:10.710
"There's this point, there
down at minus infinity.",00:49:10.710,00:49:13.650
"There's this, there's this,
and there's this.",00:49:13.650,00:49:18.370
"Only one out of five is
a critical point.",00:49:18.370,00:49:23.620
"So there's more that
you have to pay",00:49:23.620,00:49:25.030
attention to on the function.,00:49:25.030,00:49:26.450
"And you always have to keep the
schema, the picture of the",00:49:26.450,00:49:29.800
"function, in the back
of your head.",00:49:29.800,00:49:31.310
"Even though this may be the most
interesting point, and",00:49:31.310,00:49:33.820
"the one that you're going
to be looking at.",00:49:33.820,00:49:36.520
"So we'll do a few examples
of that next time.",00:49:36.520,00:49:41.180
