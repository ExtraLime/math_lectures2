"PROFESSOR: So we're through
with techniques of",00:00:21.660,00:00:24.430
"integration, which is really the
most technical thing that",00:00:24.430,00:00:26.730
we're going to be doing.,00:00:26.730,00:00:28.040
"And now we're just
clearing up a few",00:00:28.040,00:00:33.200
loose ends about calculus.,00:00:33.200,00:00:37.080
"And the one we're going to talk
about today will allow us",00:00:37.080,00:00:40.810
to deal with infinity.,00:00:40.810,00:00:45.530
"And it's what's known
as L'Hopital's Rule.",00:00:45.530,00:00:50.940
Here's L'Hopital's Rule.,00:00:50.940,00:00:55.990
"And that's what we're
going to do today.",00:00:55.990,00:01:01.360
"L'Hopital's Rule it's also known
as L'Hospital's Rule.",00:01:01.360,00:01:14.990
"That's the same name, since the
circumflex is what you put",00:01:14.990,00:01:19.840
in French to omit the s.,00:01:19.840,00:01:25.610
"So it's the same thing, and
it's still pronounced",00:01:25.610,00:01:27.290
"L'Hopital, even if it's
got an s in it.",00:01:27.290,00:01:29.840
"Alright, so that's the
first thing you need",00:01:29.840,00:01:32.160
to know about it.,00:01:32.160,00:01:33.650
"And what this method does is,
it's a convenient way to",00:01:33.650,00:01:42.040
"calculate limits including
some new ones.",00:01:42.040,00:01:55.410
"So it'll be convenient
for the old ones.",00:01:55.410,00:02:02.670
"There are going to be some new
ones and, as an example, you",00:02:02.670,00:02:09.310
"can calculate x ln x as
x goes to infinity.",00:02:09.310,00:02:14.910
"You could, whoops, that's not a
very interesting one, let's",00:02:14.910,00:02:17.100
"try x goes to 0 from
the positive side.",00:02:17.100,00:02:20.470
"And you can calculate, for
example, x e^ - x, as x goes",00:02:20.470,00:02:26.590
to infinity.,00:02:26.590,00:02:30.190
"And, well, maybe I should
include a few others.",00:02:30.190,00:02:37.340
"Maybe something like ln x /
x as x goes to infinity.",00:02:37.340,00:02:46.550
"So these are some examples of
things which, in fact, if you",00:02:46.550,00:02:50.580
"plug into your calculator,
you can see what's",00:02:50.580,00:02:52.380
happening with these.,00:02:52.380,00:02:53.220
"But if you want to understand
them systematically, it's much",00:02:53.220,00:02:56.430
"better to have this tool
of L'Hopital's Rule.",00:02:56.430,00:03:00.140
"And certainly there isn't
a proof just based on a",00:03:00.140,00:03:02.970
calculation in a calculator.,00:03:02.970,00:03:05.310
So now here's the idea.,00:03:05.310,00:03:07.760
"I'll illustrate the idea
first with an example.",00:03:07.760,00:03:11.750
"And then we'll make
it systematic.",00:03:11.750,00:03:13.380
"And then we're going
to generalize it.",00:03:13.380,00:03:15.020
"We'll make it much more, so
when it includes these new",00:03:15.020,00:03:18.840
"limits, there are some little
pieces of trickiness that you",00:03:18.840,00:03:21.330
have to understand.,00:03:21.330,00:03:23.050
"So, let's just take an example
that you could have done in",00:03:23.050,00:03:28.850
"the very first unit
of this class.",00:03:28.850,00:03:31.070
"The limit as x goes to 1 of
x ^ 10 - 1 / x ^2 - 1.",00:03:31.070,00:03:41.230
"So that's a limit that
we could've handled.",00:03:41.230,00:03:45.370
"And the thing that's
interesting, I mean, if you",00:03:45.370,00:03:48.110
"like this is in this category
that we mentioned at the",00:03:48.110,00:03:50.070
"beginning of the course
of interesting limits.",00:03:50.070,00:03:52.480
"What's interesting about it is
that if you do this silly",00:03:52.480,00:03:55.750
"thing, which is just plug in
x = 1, at x = 1 you're",00:03:55.750,00:04:00.700
going to get 0 / 0.,00:04:00.700,00:04:02.480
"And that's what we call
an indeterminate form.",00:04:02.480,00:04:12.720
It's just unclear what it is.,00:04:12.720,00:04:15.340
"From that plugging, in you
just can't get it.",00:04:15.340,00:04:18.150
"Now, on the other
hand, there's a",00:04:18.150,00:04:19.490
trick for doing this.,00:04:19.490,00:04:21.360
"And this is the trick
that we did at the",00:04:21.360,00:04:23.960
beginning of the class.,00:04:23.960,00:04:25.350
"And the idea is I can divide
in the numerator and",00:04:25.350,00:04:32.040
denominator by x - 1.,00:04:32.040,00:04:36.230
"So this limit is unchanged, if
I try to cancel the hidden",00:04:36.230,00:04:43.060
"factor x - 1 in the numerator
and denominator.",00:04:43.060,00:04:46.400
"Now, we can actually carry out
these ratios of polynomials",00:04:46.400,00:04:51.630
"and calculate them by long
division in algebra.",00:04:51.630,00:04:54.580
"That's very, very long.",00:04:54.580,00:04:55.660
"We want to do this
with calculus.",00:04:55.660,00:04:57.110
"And we already have. We already
know that this ratio",00:04:57.110,00:05:01.170
"is what's called a difference
quotient.",00:05:01.170,00:05:03.420
"And then in the limit, it tends
to the derivative of",00:05:03.420,00:05:06.380
this function.,00:05:06.380,00:05:08.340
"So the idea is that this is
actually equal to, in the",00:05:08.340,00:05:12.390
"limit, now let's just study
one piece of it.",00:05:12.390,00:05:15.400
"So if I have a function f ( x),
which is x ^ 10 - 1, and",00:05:15.400,00:05:21.150
"the value at 1 happens to
be equal to 0, then this",00:05:21.150,00:05:26.710
"expression that we have, which
is in disguise, this is in",00:05:26.710,00:05:32.350
"disguise the difference
quotient, tends to, as x goes",00:05:32.350,00:05:38.300
"to 1, the derivative,
which is f' ( 1).",00:05:38.300,00:05:43.030
That's what it is.,00:05:43.030,00:05:43.620
"So we know what the numerator
goes to, and similarly we'll",00:05:43.620,00:05:46.090
"know what the denominator
goes to.",00:05:46.090,00:05:47.650
But what is that?,00:05:47.650,00:05:51.580
"Well, f ' (x) = 10x ^ 9.",00:05:51.580,00:05:58.460
So we know what the answer is.,00:05:58.460,00:06:00.610
In the numerator it's 10x ^ 9.,00:06:00.610,00:06:03.550
"In the denominator, it's going
to be 2x, that's the",00:06:03.550,00:06:06.470
derivative of x ^2 - 1.,00:06:06.470,00:06:08.340
"And then were going to have
to evaluate that at x = 1.",00:06:08.340,00:06:13.930
"And so it's going to be
10/2, which is 5.",00:06:13.930,00:06:18.160
So the answer is 5.,00:06:18.160,00:06:19.350
"And it's pretty easy to get
from our techniques and",00:06:19.350,00:06:23.050
"knowledge of derivatives,
using this rather clever",00:06:23.050,00:06:26.580
algebraic trick.,00:06:26.580,00:06:27.510
"This business of dividing
by x - 1.",00:06:27.510,00:06:33.540
"What I want to do now is just
carry this method out",00:06:33.540,00:06:38.030
systematically.,00:06:38.030,00:06:39.420
"And that's going to give us the
approach to what's known",00:06:39.420,00:06:44.290
as L'Hopital's Rule.,00:06:44.290,00:06:45.260
"What my main subject
for today.",00:06:45.260,00:06:48.860
So here's the idea.,00:06:48.860,00:06:50.040
"Suppose we're considering, in
general, a limit as x goes to",00:06:50.040,00:06:53.530
"some number a of f
( x) / g ( x).",00:06:53.530,00:06:58.860
"And suppose it's the bad case
where we can't decide.",00:06:58.860,00:07:02.330
"So it's in determinate.
f ( a) = g ( a) = 0.",00:07:02.330,00:07:09.200
So it would be 0 / 0.,00:07:09.200,00:07:11.730
"Now we're just going to
do exactly the same",00:07:11.730,00:07:13.580
thing we did over here.,00:07:13.580,00:07:15.520
"Namely, we're going to divide
a numerator and denominator,",00:07:15.520,00:07:19.170
"and we're going to repeat
that argument.",00:07:19.170,00:07:21.010
"So we have here f
( x) / x - a.",00:07:21.010,00:07:25.390
And g (x) / x - a also.,00:07:25.390,00:07:30.240
"I haven't changed
anything yet.",00:07:30.240,00:07:33.200
"And now I'm going to write it
in this suggestive form.",00:07:33.200,00:07:38.120
"Namely, I'm going to take
separately the limit in the",00:07:38.120,00:07:41.050
numerator and the denominator.,00:07:41.050,00:07:42.330
"And I'm going to make
one more shift.",00:07:42.330,00:07:44.460
"So I'm going to take the limit,
as x goes to a in the",00:07:44.460,00:07:47.250
"numerator, but I'm going
to write it as f ( x) -",00:07:47.250,00:07:49.960
f ( a) / x - a.,00:07:49.960,00:07:53.270
"So that's the way I'm going to
write the numerator, and I've",00:07:53.270,00:07:54.870
"got to draw a much
longer line here.",00:07:54.870,00:07:57.580
"So why am I allowed
to do that?",00:07:57.580,00:07:59.720
That's because f (a) = 0.,00:07:59.720,00:08:02.690
"So I didn't change this
numerator of the numerator any",00:08:02.690,00:08:07.000
by subtracting. f ( a) = 0.,00:08:07.000,00:08:12.210
"And I'll do the same thing
to the denominator.",00:08:12.210,00:08:19.260
"Again, g ( a) = 0,
so this is OK.",00:08:19.260,00:08:22.650
"And lo and behold, I know
what these limits are.",00:08:22.650,00:08:25.760
This is f ' (a) / g '(a).,00:08:25.760,00:08:34.110
So that's it.,00:08:34.110,00:08:34.660
"That's the technique and this
evaluates the limit.",00:08:34.660,00:08:36.880
And it's not so difficult.,00:08:36.880,00:08:38.070
"The formula's pretty
straightforward here.",00:08:38.070,00:08:40.310
"And it works, provided that
g ' (a) is not 0.",00:08:40.310,00:08:51.410
"Yeah, question.",00:08:51.410,00:08:52.590
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:08:52.590,00:09:05.040
"PROFESSOR: The question is, is
there a more intuitive way of",00:09:05.040,00:09:10.900
understanding this procedure.,00:09:10.900,00:09:14.210
"And I think the short answer
is that there are other,",00:09:14.210,00:09:21.650
"similar, ways.",00:09:21.650,00:09:22.600
"I don't consider them to
be more intuitive.",00:09:22.600,00:09:25.520
"I will be mentioning one of
them, which is the idea of",00:09:25.520,00:09:28.180
"linearization, which goes back
to what we did in Unit 2.",00:09:28.180,00:09:33.280
"I think it's very important to
understand all of these, more",00:09:33.280,00:09:35.480
"or less, at once.",00:09:35.480,00:09:36.810
"But I wouldn't claim that any
of these methods is a more",00:09:36.810,00:09:39.530
intuitive one than the other.,00:09:39.530,00:09:41.890
"But basically what's happening
is, we're looking at the",00:09:41.890,00:09:43.830
"linear approximation
to f, at a.",00:09:43.830,00:09:46.340
"And the linear approximation
to g at a.",00:09:46.340,00:09:48.980
That's what underlies this.,00:09:48.980,00:09:52.880
"So now I get to formulate for
you L'Hopital's Rule at least",00:09:52.880,00:09:56.630
"in what I would call the
easy version or, if you",00:09:56.630,00:09:59.430
"like, Version 1.",00:09:59.430,00:10:00.520
So here's L'Hopital's Rule.,00:10:00.520,00:10:10.290
Version 1.,00:10:10.290,00:10:15.290
"It's not going to be quite the
same as what we just did.",00:10:15.290,00:10:18.480
"It's going to be much,
much better.",00:10:18.480,00:10:20.670
And more useful.,00:10:20.670,00:10:22.860
"And what is going to take care
of is this problem that the",00:10:22.860,00:10:25.840
denominator is not 0.,00:10:25.840,00:10:29.730
"So now here's what we're
going to do.",00:10:29.730,00:10:31.420
"We're going to say that it turns
out that the limit a x",00:10:31.420,00:10:35.000
"goes to a of f(x) / g ( x) = the
limit as x goes to a to a",00:10:35.000,00:10:44.480
f '(x) / g' (x).,00:10:44.480,00:10:48.210
"Now, that looks practically
the same as",00:10:48.210,00:10:50.160
what we said before.,00:10:50.160,00:10:51.380
"And I have to make sure that you
understand when it works.",00:10:51.380,00:10:55.310
"So it works provided this is
one of these undefined",00:10:55.310,00:11:02.820
expressions.,00:11:02.820,00:11:03.430
"In other words, f (
a) = g ( a) = 0.",00:11:03.430,00:11:06.700
"So we have a 0 / 0 expression,
indeterminant.",00:11:06.700,00:11:11.320
"And, also, we need one
more assumption.",00:11:11.320,00:11:15.280
"And the right-hand side, the
right-hand limit exists.",00:11:15.280,00:11:30.360
"Now, this is practically
the same thing as",00:11:30.360,00:11:33.510
what I said over here.,00:11:33.510,00:11:35.310
"Namely, I took the ratio of
these functions, x ^ 10 - 1",00:11:35.310,00:11:41.050
and x ^2 - 1.,00:11:41.050,00:11:42.540
"I took their derivatives, which
is what I did right",00:11:42.540,00:11:45.460
"here, right.",00:11:45.460,00:11:46.180
"I just differentiated them
and I took the ratio.",00:11:46.180,00:11:48.480
"This is way easier than the
quotient rule, and is nothing",00:11:48.480,00:11:51.680
like the quotient rule.,00:11:51.680,00:11:53.780
Don't think quotient rule.,00:11:53.780,00:11:56.900
Don't think quotient rule.,00:11:56.900,00:11:58.070
"So we differentiate the
numerator and denominator",00:11:58.070,00:12:00.360
separately.,00:12:00.360,00:12:02.400
"And then I take the limit as
x goes to 1 and I get 5.",00:12:02.400,00:12:08.030
"So that's what I'm claiming
over here.",00:12:08.030,00:12:09.940
"I take these functions, I
replace them with this ratio",00:12:09.940,00:12:12.275
"of derivatives, and then
I take the limit",00:12:12.275,00:12:14.000
"instead, over here.",00:12:14.000,00:12:15.650
"And it turned out that the
functions got much simpler",00:12:15.650,00:12:18.020
when I differentiated them.,00:12:18.020,00:12:19.120
"I started with this messy object
and I got this much",00:12:19.120,00:12:21.790
"easier object that I could
easily evaluate.",00:12:21.790,00:12:25.520
"So that's the big game that's
happening here.",00:12:25.520,00:12:29.830
"It works, if this limit makes
sense and this limit exists.",00:12:29.830,00:12:33.495
"Now, notice I didn't claim that
g, that the denominator,",00:12:33.495,00:12:38.130
had to be non-0.,00:12:38.130,00:12:40.260
"So that's what's going
to help us a little",00:12:40.260,00:12:42.070
bit in a few examples.,00:12:42.070,00:12:43.430
"So let me give you a couple
of examples and",00:12:43.430,00:12:45.650
then we'll go further.,00:12:45.650,00:12:46.570
"Now, this is only Version 1.",00:12:46.570,00:12:48.470
"But first we have to understand
how this one works.",00:12:48.470,00:12:51.340
So here's another example.,00:12:51.340,00:12:56.300
"Take the limit as x goes to
0, of sin 5x / sin 2x.",00:12:56.300,00:13:06.400
"This is another kind of example
of a limit that we",00:13:06.400,00:13:10.060
"discussed in the first
part of the course.",00:13:10.060,00:13:12.350
"Unfortunately, now we're
reviewing stuff.",00:13:12.350,00:13:13.930
"So this should reinforce
what you did there.",00:13:13.930,00:13:15.980
"This will be an easier way
of thinking about it.",00:13:15.980,00:13:20.330
"So by L'Hopital's Rule,
so here's the step.",00:13:20.330,00:13:25.050
"We're going to take one
of these steps.",00:13:25.050,00:13:27.870
"This is the limit, as x goes to
1, of the derivatives here.",00:13:27.870,00:13:31.560
So that's 5 cos 5x / 2 cos 2x.,00:13:31.560,00:13:43.220
"The limit was 1 over there,
but now it's 0. a",00:13:43.220,00:13:46.735
is 0 in this case.,00:13:46.735,00:13:48.530
This is the number a.,00:13:48.530,00:13:51.500
Thank you.,00:13:51.500,00:13:54.930
"So the limit as x goes to 0 is
the same as the limit of the",00:13:54.930,00:13:58.760
derivatives.,00:13:58.760,00:14:01.400
And that's easy to evaluate.,00:14:01.400,00:14:02.620
"Cosine of 0 = 1, right.",00:14:02.620,00:14:04.910
"This is equal to
5 (cos (5* 0).",00:14:04.910,00:14:10.550
"And that's a multiplication
sign.",00:14:10.550,00:14:12.840
"Maybe I should just
write this as 0.",00:14:12.840,00:14:14.660
Divided by 2 cos 0.,00:14:14.660,00:14:17.240
But you know that that's 5/2.,00:14:17.240,00:14:24.440
"So this is how L'Hopital's
method works.",00:14:24.440,00:14:27.340
It's pretty painless.,00:14:27.340,00:14:33.660
"I'm going to give you another
example, which shows that it",00:14:33.660,00:14:36.540
"works a little better
than the method that",00:14:36.540,00:14:39.010
I started out with.,00:14:39.010,00:14:45.550
"Here's what happens if we
consider the function",00:14:45.550,00:14:48.380
cos x - 1 / x ^2.,00:14:48.380,00:14:55.470
"That was a little harder
to deal with.",00:14:55.470,00:14:57.940
"And again, this is one of these
0 / 0 things near x = 0.",00:14:57.940,00:15:03.060
"As x tends to 0, this goes to
an indeterminate form here.",00:15:03.060,00:15:11.200
"Now, according to our method,
this is equivalent to, now I'm",00:15:11.200,00:15:14.370
"going to use this little wiggle
because I don't want to",00:15:14.370,00:15:16.630
"write limit, limit, limit,
limit a million times.",00:15:16.630,00:15:20.030
"So I'm going to use a
little wiggle here.",00:15:20.030,00:15:22.330
"So as x goes to 0, this is going
to behave the same way",00:15:22.330,00:15:26.840
"as differentiating numerator
and denominator.",00:15:26.840,00:15:30.390
"So again this is going to be
- sin x in the numerator.",00:15:30.390,00:15:33.640
"In the denominator, it's
going to be 2x.",00:15:33.640,00:15:42.110
"Now, notice that we still
haven't won yet.",00:15:42.110,00:15:47.140
"Because this is still
of 0 / 0 type.",00:15:47.140,00:15:51.060
"When you plug in x =
0 you still get 0.",00:15:51.060,00:15:54.000
"But that doesn't damage
the method.",00:15:54.000,00:15:57.270
"That doesn't make
the method fail.",00:15:57.270,00:16:00.630
"This 0 / 0, we can
apply L'Hopital's",00:16:00.630,00:16:03.270
Rule a second time.,00:16:03.270,00:16:10.410
"And as x goes to 0 this is
the same thing as, again,",00:16:10.410,00:16:13.120
"differentiating the numerator
and denominator.",00:16:13.120,00:16:14.860
"So here I get - cos x in the
numerator, and I get 2 in the",00:16:14.860,00:16:19.900
denominator.,00:16:19.900,00:16:22.480
Again this is way easier than,00:16:22.480,00:16:24.300
differentiating ratios of functions.,00:16:24.300,00:16:26.260
"We're only differentiating the
numerator and the denominator",00:16:26.260,00:16:29.240
separately.,00:16:29.240,00:16:33.060
And now this is the end.,00:16:33.060,00:16:35.960
"As x goes to 0, this is - cos
0 / 2, which is - 1/2.",00:16:35.960,00:16:48.660
"Now, the justification for this
comes only when you win",00:16:48.660,00:16:53.710
in the end and get the limit.,00:16:53.710,00:16:56.130
"Because what the theorem says is
that if one of these limits",00:16:56.130,00:16:58.820
"exists, then the preceding
one exists.",00:16:58.820,00:17:01.580
"And once the preceding
one exists, then the",00:17:01.580,00:17:03.100
one before it exists.,00:17:03.100,00:17:03.980
"So once we know that this one
exists, that works backwards.",00:17:03.980,00:17:09.480
"It applies to the preceding
limit, which then applies to",00:17:09.480,00:17:11.950
the very first one.,00:17:11.950,00:17:15.030
"And the logical structure here
is a little subtle, which is",00:17:15.030,00:17:18.000
"that if the right side exists,
then the left side will also",00:17:18.000,00:17:22.460
"exist. Yeah, question.",00:17:22.460,00:17:26.380
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:17:26.380,00:17:32.620
"PROFESSOR: Why does the
right-hand limit have to",00:17:32.620,00:17:34.410
"exist, isn't it just the
derivative that has to exist?",00:17:34.410,00:17:37.120
No.,00:17:37.120,00:17:38.470
"The derivative of the numerator
has to exist. The",00:17:38.470,00:17:40.500
"derivative of the denominator
has to exist. And this limit",00:17:40.500,00:17:43.420
"has to exist. What doesn't have
to exist, by the way, I",00:17:43.420,00:17:47.390
"never said that f prime of a
has to exist. In fact, it's",00:17:47.390,00:17:51.080
"much, much more subtle.",00:17:51.080,00:17:53.690
"I'm not claiming that f ' (a)
exists, because in order to",00:17:53.690,00:17:56.380
"evaluate this limit, f ' (a)
need not exist. What has to",00:17:56.380,00:18:01.990
"happen is that nearby, for x not
equal to a, these things",00:18:01.990,00:18:06.050
"exist. And then the limit has
to exist. So there's no",00:18:06.050,00:18:10.060
"requirements that the limits
exist. In fact, that's exactly",00:18:10.060,00:18:13.630
"going to be the point when we
evaluate these limits here.",00:18:13.630,00:18:16.860
"Is we don't have to evaluate
it right at the end.",00:18:16.860,00:18:22.760
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:18:22.760,00:18:26.540
"PROFESSOR: So the question that
you're asking is, why is",00:18:26.540,00:18:30.050
"this the hypothesis
of the theorem?",00:18:30.050,00:18:31.970
"In other words, why
does this work?",00:18:31.970,00:18:34.700
"Well, the answer is that this
is a theorem that's true.",00:18:34.700,00:18:37.370
"If you drop this hypothesis,
it's totally false.",00:18:37.370,00:18:40.050
"And if you don't have this
hypothesis, you can't use the",00:18:40.050,00:18:42.520
"theorem and you will get
the wrong answer.",00:18:42.520,00:18:44.820
"I mean, it's hard to express
it any further than that.",00:18:44.820,00:18:48.320
"So look, in many cases
we tell you formulas.",00:18:48.320,00:18:52.040
"And in many cases it's so
obvious when they're true that",00:18:52.040,00:18:56.280
"we don't have to worry
about what we say.",00:18:56.280,00:18:59.610
"And indeed, there's something
implicit here.",00:18:59.610,00:19:01.980
"I'm saying well, you know, if
I wrote this symbol down, it",00:19:01.980,00:19:04.550
"must mean that the
thing exists.",00:19:04.550,00:19:06.370
So that's a subtle point.,00:19:06.370,00:19:08.280
"But what I'm emphasizing is that
you don't need to know in",00:19:08.280,00:19:11.850
advance that this one exists.,00:19:11.850,00:19:13.730
"You do need to know in advance
that that one exists.",00:19:13.730,00:19:18.020
"Essentially, yeah.",00:19:18.020,00:19:19.850
"So that's the direction
that it goes.",00:19:19.850,00:19:24.620
"You can't get away with not
having this exist and still",00:19:24.620,00:19:28.100
have the statement be true.,00:19:28.100,00:19:37.740
"Alright, another question.",00:19:37.740,00:19:38.600
Thank you.,00:19:38.600,00:19:39.740
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:19:39.740,00:19:47.700
"PROFESSOR: So I'm getting a
little ahead of myself, but",00:19:47.700,00:19:53.080
let me just say.,00:19:53.080,00:19:54.610
"In these situations here, when x
is going to 0 and x is going",00:19:54.610,00:19:59.670
to infinity.,00:19:59.670,00:20:00.120
"For instance, here when x goes
to 0, the logarithm is",00:20:00.120,00:20:02.900
undefined at x = 0.,00:20:02.900,00:20:06.340
"Nevertheless, this
theorem applies.",00:20:06.340,00:20:08.240
And we'll be able to use it.,00:20:08.240,00:20:10.170
"Over here, as x goes to
infinity, neither of these --",00:20:10.170,00:20:12.520
"well, actually, come to think
of it, e^ -x, if you like,",00:20:12.520,00:20:15.540
it's equal to 0 at infinity.,00:20:15.540,00:20:17.890
"If you want to say that
it has a value.",00:20:17.890,00:20:21.220
"But in fact, these expressions
don't necessarily have values.",00:20:21.220,00:20:25.700
At the ends.,00:20:25.700,00:20:27.340
"And nevertheless, the
theorem applies.",00:20:27.340,00:20:33.160
"I mean, it can exist. It's
perfectly OK for it to exist.",00:20:33.160,00:20:36.930
It's no problem.,00:20:36.930,00:20:37.910
"It just doesn't need
to exists.",00:20:37.910,00:20:39.220
It isn't forced to exist.,00:20:39.220,00:20:45.080
"So here's a calculation
which we just did.",00:20:45.080,00:20:50.090
And we evaluated this.,00:20:50.090,00:20:51.460
"Now, I want to make a comparison
with the method of",00:20:51.460,00:20:58.050
approximation.,00:20:58.050,00:21:06.770
"In the method of approximations,
this Example",00:21:06.770,00:21:09.990
"2, which was the example with
the sine function, we would",00:21:09.990,00:21:14.780
use the following property.,00:21:14.780,00:21:16.820
"We would use sin u is
approximately u.",00:21:16.820,00:21:19.370
"We would use that linear
approximation.",00:21:19.370,00:21:22.120
"And then what we would have here
is that sin 5x / sin 2x",00:21:22.120,00:21:29.160
"is approximately 5x / 2x,
which is of course 5/2.",00:21:29.160,00:21:35.610
"And this is true when u is
approximately 0, and this is",00:21:35.610,00:21:38.490
"true certainly as x goes
to 0, it's going",00:21:38.490,00:21:41.550
to be a valid limit.,00:21:41.550,00:21:45.880
"So that's very similar
to Example 2.",00:21:45.880,00:21:50.640
"In Example 3, we managed to look
at this expression cos x",00:21:50.640,00:21:56.530
- 1 / x ^2.,00:21:56.530,00:21:59.640
"And for this one, you have to
remember the approximation",00:21:59.640,00:22:03.510
"near x = 0 to the
cosine function.",00:22:03.510,00:22:07.940
And that's 1 - x ^2 / 2.,00:22:07.940,00:22:15.580
"So that was the approximation,
the quadratic approximation to",00:22:15.580,00:22:18.850
the cosine function.,00:22:18.850,00:22:20.250
"And now, sure enough,
this simplifies.",00:22:20.250,00:22:22.780
"This becomes - x ^2 / 2 /
x ^2, which is - 1/2.",00:22:22.780,00:22:32.630
"So we get the same answer,
which is a good thing.",00:22:32.630,00:22:34.620
"Because both of these
methods are valid.",00:22:34.620,00:22:36.450
They're consistent.,00:22:36.450,00:22:39.520
"You can see that neither
of them is",00:22:39.520,00:22:41.600
particularly a lot longer.,00:22:41.600,00:22:42.940
"You may have trouble remembering
this property.",00:22:42.940,00:22:45.490
"But in fact it's something that
you can easily derive.",00:22:45.490,00:22:51.050
"And, indeed, it's related to the
second derivative of the",00:22:51.050,00:22:54.705
"cosine, as is this
calculation here.",00:22:54.705,00:22:56.540
"They're almost the same amount
of numerical content to them.",00:22:56.540,00:23:04.260
"So now what I'd like to do is
explain to you why L'Hopital's",00:23:04.260,00:23:12.240
"Rule works better
in some cases.",00:23:12.240,00:23:14.970
"And the real value that it has
is in handling these other",00:23:14.970,00:23:20.350
more exotic limits.,00:23:20.350,00:23:25.550
"So now we're going to do
L'Hopital's Rule over again.",00:23:25.550,00:23:33.960
"And I'll handle these
functions.",00:23:33.960,00:23:35.360
"But I'll have to rewrite them,
but we'll just do that.",00:23:35.360,00:23:40.680
So here's the property.,00:23:40.680,00:23:42.100
"That the limit as x goes to a of
f ( x) / g (x) is equal to",00:23:42.100,00:23:48.260
"the limit as x goes to a
of f ' ( x) / g '(x).",00:23:48.260,00:23:54.730
That's the property.,00:23:54.730,00:23:55.980
"And this is what we'll
always be using.",00:23:55.980,00:23:57.990
Very convenient thing.,00:23:57.990,00:23:59.490
"And remember it was true
provided that f (",00:23:59.490,00:24:04.660
a) = g (a) = 0.,00:24:04.660,00:24:11.530
"And that the right-hand
side exists.",00:24:11.530,00:24:23.240
"But I claim that it
works better, and",00:24:23.240,00:24:25.600
I'll get rid of these.,00:24:25.600,00:24:26.340
"But I'll write them again
to show you that",00:24:26.340,00:24:29.980
it works for these.,00:24:29.980,00:24:30.990
So there are other cases.,00:24:30.990,00:24:43.680
"And the other cases that
are allowed are this.",00:24:43.680,00:24:47.250
"First of all, as indicated by
what I just erased, you can",00:24:47.250,00:24:51.230
"allow a to be equal to plus
or minus infinity.",00:24:51.230,00:24:53.570
It's also OK.,00:24:53.570,00:24:57.680
"So you can take the
limit going to the",00:24:57.680,00:25:03.820
far ends of the universe.,00:25:03.820,00:25:05.110
Both left and right.,00:25:05.110,00:25:06.630
"And then the other thing that
you can do is, you can allow f",00:25:06.630,00:25:12.265
"( a) and g (a) to be plus
or minus infinity.",00:25:12.265,00:25:19.690
Is OK.,00:25:19.690,00:25:22.540
"So now, the point is that we can
handle not just the 0 / 0",00:25:22.540,00:25:26.670
"case, but also the infinity
/ infinity case.",00:25:26.670,00:25:33.780
"That's a very powerful tool, and
quite different from the",00:25:33.780,00:25:37.020
other cases.,00:25:37.020,00:25:42.050
"And the third thing is that the
right-hand side doesn't",00:25:42.050,00:25:49.610
"really quite have to exist,
in the ordinary sense.",00:25:49.610,00:25:56.500
"Or, it could be plus
or minus infinity.",00:25:56.500,00:26:00.460
That's also OK.,00:26:00.460,00:26:01.970
That's still information.,00:26:01.970,00:26:04.270
"So if we can see where it goes,
then we're still good.",00:26:04.270,00:26:10.620
"If it goes to plus infinity, if
it goes to 0, if it goes to",00:26:10.620,00:26:12.920
"a finite number, if it goes to
minus infinity, all of that",00:26:12.920,00:26:15.490
will be OK.,00:26:15.490,00:26:16.390
"It just if it oscillates wildly
that we'll be lost. And",00:26:16.390,00:26:19.550
"those calculations we'll
never encounter.",00:26:19.550,00:26:27.500
"So this basically handles
everything that you could",00:26:27.500,00:26:29.710
possibly hope for.,00:26:29.710,00:26:32.050
"And it's a very convenient
process.",00:26:32.050,00:26:37.050
"So let me carry out
a few examples.",00:26:37.050,00:26:40.510
"And, let's see, I guess the
first one that I wanted to do",00:26:40.510,00:26:44.760
was x ln x.,00:26:44.760,00:26:47.640
So what example are we up to.,00:26:47.640,00:26:49.300
"Example 3, so Example
4 is coming up.",00:26:49.300,00:26:57.150
"Example 4, this is one of the
ones that I wrote at the",00:26:57.150,00:26:59.560
"beginning of the lecture,
x ln x.",00:26:59.560,00:27:06.430
"This one was on our
homework problem.",00:27:06.430,00:27:12.930
"In the limits of some
calculation.",00:27:12.930,00:27:17.740
"But so this one, you have to
look at it first to think",00:27:17.740,00:27:26.170
about what it's doing.,00:27:26.170,00:27:27.020
"It's an indeterminate form, but
it sort of looks like it's",00:27:27.020,00:27:29.530
the wrong type.,00:27:29.530,00:27:30.980
"So why is it in an indeterminate
form.",00:27:30.980,00:27:33.070
"This one goes to 0, and this
one goes to minus infinity.",00:27:33.070,00:27:38.600
"So, excuse me, this
is a product.",00:27:38.600,00:27:40.460
It's 0 times minus infinity.,00:27:40.460,00:27:46.210
"So that's an indeterminate form,
because we don't know",00:27:46.210,00:27:48.010
"whether the 0 wins or the
infinity this could keep",00:27:48.010,00:27:50.200
"getting smaller and smaller and
smaller, and this could be",00:27:50.200,00:27:51.850
"getting bigger and
bigger bigger.",00:27:51.850,00:27:52.890
"The product could be anything
in between.",00:27:52.890,00:27:55.420
We just don't know.,00:27:55.420,00:27:57.740
"So the first step is to write
this as a ratio of things,",00:27:57.740,00:28:04.270
"rather than a product
of things.",00:28:04.270,00:28:06.840
"And it turns out that the way
to do that is to use the",00:28:06.840,00:28:09.770
"logarithm in the numerator,
and the 1 / x in the",00:28:09.770,00:28:13.220
denominator.,00:28:13.220,00:28:14.360
"So this is a choice that
I'm making here.",00:28:14.360,00:28:18.040
"Now, I've just converted it to
a limit of the type minus",00:28:18.040,00:28:23.800
infinity divided by infinity.,00:28:23.800,00:28:28.100
"Because the numerator is going
to minus infinity as x goes to",00:28:28.100,00:28:30.830
"0 plus and the denominator 1 /
x is going to plus infinity.",00:28:30.830,00:28:37.550
"Again, there's a competitions,
but now it's one of the forms",00:28:37.550,00:28:40.300
"to which L'Hopital's
Rule applies.",00:28:40.300,00:28:44.210
"Now I'm just going to apply
L'Hopital's Rule.",00:28:44.210,00:28:49.400
"And what it says is that
I differentiate here.",00:28:49.400,00:28:54.670
"So I just differentiate a
numerator and denominator.",00:28:54.670,00:28:56.500
"Applying L'Hopital's
Rule is a breeze.",00:28:56.500,00:28:58.900
"You just differentiate,
differentiate.",00:28:58.900,00:29:03.710
"And now it just simplifies
and we're done.",00:29:03.710,00:29:06.810
"This is the limit as x
goes to 0 plus of,",00:29:06.810,00:29:12.260
"well, the x^2's cancel.",00:29:12.260,00:29:14.180
"This is the same as just
- x. x factors cancel.",00:29:14.180,00:29:20.360
And so that's 0.,00:29:20.360,00:29:21.820
The answer is that it's 0.,00:29:21.820,00:29:24.170
"So x goes to 0 faster then ln
n goes to minus infinity.",00:29:24.170,00:29:30.650
This 0 was the winner.,00:29:30.650,00:29:36.400
Something you can't,00:29:36.400,00:29:37.430
necessarily predict in advance.,00:29:37.430,00:29:44.240
"So let's do the other two
examples that I wrote down.",00:29:44.240,00:29:49.920
"I'm going to do them in slightly
more generality,",00:29:49.920,00:29:53.230
"because they're the most
fundamental rate properties",00:29:53.230,00:29:58.590
"that you're going to need to
know for the next section.",00:29:58.590,00:30:01.220
Which is improper integrals.,00:30:01.220,00:30:03.000
"And also they're just very
important for physical math,",00:30:03.000,00:30:07.390
"and any other kind of
thing, basically.",00:30:07.390,00:30:10.390
"So here, let's just do these.",00:30:10.390,00:30:12.340
"So let's see, which one do I
want to do first. So I wrote",00:30:12.340,00:30:16.700
"down the limit of x e^2 - x, but
I'm going to make it even",00:30:16.700,00:30:22.400
more general.,00:30:22.400,00:30:22.970
"I'm going to make it any
negative power here, where p",00:30:22.970,00:30:26.692
is some positive constant.,00:30:26.692,00:30:30.190
"Now again, this is a product of
functions, not a quotient,",00:30:30.190,00:30:35.680
"a ratio, of functions.",00:30:35.680,00:30:37.350
And so I need to rewrite it.,00:30:37.350,00:30:41.010
"I'm going to write it
as x / e ^ p x.",00:30:41.010,00:30:50.670
"And now I'm going to apply,
well, so it's of this form",00:30:50.670,00:30:53.060
infinity / infinity.,00:30:53.060,00:30:58.420
"And now that's the same as the
limit as x goes to infinity of",00:30:58.420,00:31:02.480
1 / p e^ px.,00:31:02.480,00:31:07.520
So where does that go?,00:31:07.520,00:31:08.670
As x goes to infinity.,00:31:08.670,00:31:10.250
Now we can decide.,00:31:10.250,00:31:12.710
The 1 stays where it is.,00:31:12.710,00:31:14.430
"And this, as x goes to infinity,
goes to infinity.",00:31:14.430,00:31:23.440
So the answer is 0.,00:31:23.440,00:31:27.080
"And the conclusion is that x
grows more slowly then e ^ px.",00:31:27.080,00:31:48.500
As x goes to infinity.,00:31:48.500,00:31:49.100
"Remember, p is positive
here, of course.",00:31:49.100,00:31:50.980
"It's the increasing
exponentials.",00:31:50.980,00:31:53.990
Not the decreasing ones.,00:31:53.990,00:32:03.080
Let's do a variant of this.,00:32:03.080,00:32:08.530
I'll do it the opposite way.,00:32:08.530,00:32:10.690
"So I'm going to call
this example 5 '.",00:32:10.690,00:32:13.580
"It really doesn't give us any
more information, but it gives",00:32:13.580,00:32:15.900
"you just a little bit
more practice.",00:32:15.900,00:32:18.280
"So suppose I look at things the
other way. e^ px divided",00:32:18.280,00:32:27.800
"by, say, x^ 100.",00:32:27.800,00:32:35.260
"Now, this is an infinity /
infinity example, again.",00:32:35.260,00:32:42.010
"And you can work out
what it's doing.",00:32:42.010,00:32:44.820
"But there are two ways of
thinking about this.",00:32:44.820,00:32:48.030
"There's the slow way
and the fast way.",00:32:48.030,00:32:49.480
"The slow way is to differentiate
this 100 times.",00:32:49.480,00:32:54.390
"That is, right?",00:32:54.390,00:32:55.530
"Apply L'Hopital's Rule
over and over and",00:32:55.530,00:32:57.290
over and over again.,00:32:57.290,00:32:58.490
All the way.,00:32:58.490,00:33:00.430
"It's clear that you
could do it, but",00:33:00.430,00:33:02.150
it's kind of a nuisance.,00:33:02.150,00:33:03.570
"So there's a much cleverer
trick here.",00:33:03.570,00:33:06.850
"Which is to change this to
(the limit as x goes to",00:33:06.850,00:33:11.750
"infinity of the e ^ px
/ 100 / x) ^ 100.",00:33:11.750,00:33:25.850
"So if you do that, then
we just have one",00:33:25.850,00:33:30.700
L'Hopital's Rule step here.,00:33:30.700,00:33:34.540
"And that one is that this is
the same as (x goes to",00:33:34.540,00:33:44.130
"infinity of, well it's p / 100
e^ p x / 100 / 1) ^ 100.",00:33:44.130,00:33:55.830
That's our L'Hopital's step.,00:33:55.830,00:34:02.480
"And of course, that's (infinity
/ 1 ) ^ 100.",00:34:02.480,00:34:09.310
Which is infinity.,00:34:09.310,00:34:10.410
"Now, again I did this in a
slightly different way to show",00:34:10.410,00:34:14.360
"you that it works with
infinity as well.",00:34:14.360,00:34:16.800
So that was this other case.,00:34:16.800,00:34:18.400
"The right-hand side can
exist, or it can be",00:34:18.400,00:34:21.010
plus or minus infinity.,00:34:21.010,00:34:22.460
"And that applies
to this limit.",00:34:22.460,00:34:25.240
"And therefore, to the
original limit.",00:34:25.240,00:34:27.990
"And the conclusion here is
that e ^ px, p &gt; 0, grows",00:34:27.990,00:34:35.550
faster than any power of x.,00:34:35.550,00:34:46.340
"I picked x ^ 100, but obviously
it didn't matter",00:34:46.340,00:34:49.600
what power I picked.,00:34:49.600,00:34:52.670
"The exponents beat
all the powers.",00:34:52.670,00:35:02.050
"So we have one more of the
ones that I gave at the",00:35:02.050,00:35:04.340
beginning to take care of.,00:35:04.340,00:35:07.780
And that one is the logarithm.,00:35:07.780,00:35:11.330
And its behavior at infinity.,00:35:11.330,00:35:15.720
"So I'll do a slightly variant
on that one, too.",00:35:15.720,00:35:18.700
"So we have Example 6, which is
ln x, and instead of dividing",00:35:18.700,00:35:25.080
"by x, I'm going to
divide by x^ 1/3.",00:35:25.080,00:35:27.780
"I could divide by any positive
power of x, we'll just do this",00:35:27.780,00:35:30.650
example here.,00:35:30.650,00:35:32.170
"So now this, as x goes to
infinity, is of the form",00:35:32.170,00:35:38.340
infinity / infinity.,00:35:38.340,00:35:43.230
"And so it's equivalent to what
happens when I differentiate",00:35:43.230,00:35:47.530
"numerator and denominator
separately.",00:35:47.530,00:35:49.250
"And that's 1 / x, and here
I have 1/3 x ^ - 2/3.",00:35:49.250,00:36:00.320
"1 / x, and then 1/3 x^ - 2/3.",00:36:00.320,00:36:03.470
"Now, when the dust settles
here and you get your",00:36:03.470,00:36:05.920
"exponents right, we have an x^ -
1, and this is an x ^ + 2/3,",00:36:05.920,00:36:10.560
and that's a 1/3 becomes a 3.,00:36:10.560,00:36:12.500
So this is what it is.,00:36:12.500,00:36:19.260
"And that's equal
to 3x ^ - 1/3.",00:36:19.260,00:36:26.480
Which we can decide.,00:36:26.480,00:36:27.830
It goes to 0.,00:36:27.830,00:36:30.150
As x goes to infinity.,00:36:30.150,00:36:37.240
"And so the conclusion is that
ln x grows more slowly as x",00:36:37.240,00:36:49.910
"goes to infinity, than x ^ 1/3
or any positive power of x.",00:36:49.910,00:37:08.690
"So any x ^ p, p positive,
will work.",00:37:08.690,00:37:15.500
"So ln is really slow,
going to infinity.",00:37:15.500,00:37:17.670
"It's very, very gradual.",00:37:17.670,00:37:20.550
"Yeah, question.",00:37:20.550,00:37:21.420
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:37:21.420,00:37:45.970
"PROFESSOR: The question
is, how many",00:37:45.970,00:37:48.230
hypotheses do you need here?,00:37:48.230,00:37:50.630
"So I said that, and I think what
you were asking is, if I",00:37:50.630,00:37:57.760
"have this hypothesis, can I
also have this hypothesis.",00:37:57.760,00:38:02.940
That's OK.,00:38:02.940,00:38:04.870
"I can have this hypothesis
combined with this one.",00:38:04.870,00:38:08.840
"I need something about
f (a) and g ( a).",00:38:08.840,00:38:11.280
"I can't assume nothing
about f(a) and g(a).",00:38:11.280,00:38:14.910
"So in other words, I have to
be faced with either an",00:38:14.910,00:38:17.370
"infinity / infinity, or
a 0 / 0 situation.",00:38:17.370,00:38:24.180
So let's see.,00:38:24.180,00:38:26.650
"A rule applies in the 0 / 0, or
infinity / infinity case.",00:38:26.650,00:38:35.160
"These are the only two cases
that it applies in.",00:38:35.160,00:38:40.910
And a can be anything.,00:38:40.910,00:38:45.370
Including infinity.,00:38:45.370,00:38:48.880
Plus or minus infinity.,00:38:48.880,00:38:51.230
"The rule applies in
these two cases.",00:38:51.230,00:38:53.390
"So in other words, this is
what f ( a) / g ( a) is.",00:38:53.390,00:38:58.310
Either one of these.,00:38:58.310,00:39:00.750
"And in fact, it can
be plus or minus.",00:39:00.750,00:39:02.540
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:02.540,00:39:06.460
"PROFESSOR: And the right-hand
side has to be something.",00:39:06.460,00:39:10.290
"It has to be either finite or
plus or minus infinity.",00:39:10.290,00:39:21.250
So you need something.,00:39:21.250,00:39:23.690
"You need a specific value of a,
you need to decide whether",00:39:23.690,00:39:26.740
it's an indeterminate form.,00:39:26.740,00:39:28.070
"And you need the right-hand
limit to exist. It's not hard",00:39:28.070,00:39:31.390
to impose this.,00:39:31.390,00:39:33.530
"Because when you look at the
right-hand side, you'll want",00:39:33.530,00:39:36.423
to be calculating it.,00:39:36.423,00:39:37.350
"So you want to know
what it is.",00:39:37.350,00:39:38.600
"So you'll never have problems
confirming this hypothesis.",00:39:38.600,00:39:47.640
Alright.,00:39:47.640,00:39:51.280
"Let me give you one
more example here.",00:39:51.280,00:39:54.480
"Which is just slightly
trickier.",00:39:54.480,00:39:56.600
"Which involves, so here's
another indeterminate form.",00:39:56.600,00:40:15.130
That's going to be 0 ^ 0.,00:40:15.130,00:40:16.780
"So there are lots of these
things where you just don't",00:40:20.530,00:40:22.580
know what to do.,00:40:22.580,00:40:23.690
"And they come out in various
different ways.",00:40:23.690,00:40:27.730
"The simplest example of this
is the limit as x goes to 0",00:40:27.730,00:40:32.390
from above of x ^ x.,00:40:32.390,00:40:41.430
"In order to work out what's
happening with this one, we",00:40:41.430,00:40:45.360
have to use a trick.,00:40:45.360,00:40:47.610
"And the trick is this is
a moving exponent.",00:40:47.610,00:40:52.650
"And so it's appropriate
to use base e.",00:40:52.650,00:40:56.220
"This is something that we did
way back in the first unit.",00:40:56.220,00:40:59.010
"So, since we have a moving
exponent, we're",00:40:59.010,00:41:06.900
going to use base e.,00:41:06.900,00:41:11.830
"That's the good base
to use whenever you",00:41:11.830,00:41:13.690
have a moving exponent.,00:41:13.690,00:41:15.600
"And so rewrite this as
x^ x = e ^ x ln x.",00:41:15.600,00:41:21.530
"And now, in order to figure
out what's happening, we",00:41:21.530,00:41:23.960
really only have to know what's,00:41:23.960,00:41:25.250
going on with the exponent.,00:41:25.250,00:41:32.140
"So remember, actually
we already did this.",00:41:32.140,00:41:34.100
"But I'm going to do it
once more for you.",00:41:34.100,00:41:36.100
This is ln x / (1 / x).,00:41:36.100,00:41:39.340
"And that's equivalent, as
x goes to 0, to using",00:41:39.340,00:41:43.360
"L'Hopital's Rule to 1 / x, and
this is - 1 / x ^2, which is -",00:41:43.360,00:41:51.450
"x, which goes to 0.",00:41:51.450,00:41:54.350
As x goes to 0.,00:41:54.350,00:41:58.030
"And so what we have here is that
this one is going to be",00:41:58.030,00:42:01.670
"equivalent to, well, it's
going to tend to",00:42:01.670,00:42:06.200
what we got over here.,00:42:06.200,00:42:07.520
It's e ^ 0.,00:42:07.520,00:42:10.170
That exponent is what we want.,00:42:10.170,00:42:13.980
As x goes to 0.,00:42:13.980,00:42:18.250
"So that's the answer This
limit happens to be 1.",00:42:18.250,00:42:27.190
"That's actually relatively easy
to do, given all of the",00:42:27.190,00:42:30.050
"power that we have
at our hands.",00:42:30.050,00:42:42.700
"Now, let me give you
one more example.",00:42:42.700,00:42:49.310
"Suppose you're trying to
understand the limit",00:42:49.310,00:42:52.360
of sin x / x ^2.,00:42:52.360,00:42:59.060
"If you apply L'Hopital's Rule,
as x goes to 0, you're going",00:42:59.060,00:43:06.320
to get cos x / 2x.,00:43:06.320,00:43:11.660
"And if you apply L'Hopital's
Rule again, as x goes to 0,",00:43:11.660,00:43:19.270
"you're going to get
the - sin x / 2.",00:43:19.270,00:43:24.920
"And this, as x goes
to 0, goes to 0.",00:43:24.920,00:43:35.840
"On the other hand, if you look
at the linear approximation",00:43:35.840,00:43:39.820
"method, linear approximation
says that sin x is",00:43:39.820,00:43:49.620
approximately x near 0.,00:43:49.620,00:43:55.090
So that should be x / x ^2.,00:43:55.090,00:43:59.560
"Which is 1 / x, which
goes to infinity.",00:43:59.560,00:44:04.900
"As x goes to 0, at least from
one side, minus infinity to",00:44:04.900,00:44:08.980
the other side.,00:44:08.980,00:44:13.100
"So there's something fishy
going on here, right?",00:44:13.100,00:44:17.320
So this is fishy.,00:44:17.320,00:44:19.330
"Or maybe this is fishy,
I don't know.",00:44:19.330,00:44:21.520
"So, tell me what's wrong here.",00:44:21.520,00:44:26.420
Yeah.,00:44:26.420,00:44:26.750
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:44:26.750,00:44:37.120
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:44:37.120,00:44:38.230
"So the claim is that the
second application of",00:44:38.230,00:44:43.070
"L'Hopital's Rule, this
one, is wrong.",00:44:43.070,00:44:51.950
And that's correct.,00:44:51.950,00:44:54.620
"And this is where you
have to watch out,",00:44:54.620,00:44:56.700
with L'Hopital's Rule.,00:44:56.700,00:44:58.500
"This is exactly where you
have to watch out.",00:44:58.500,00:44:59.920
"You have to apply the
test. Here it's an",00:44:59.920,00:45:03.580
indeterminate form.,00:45:03.580,00:45:03.820
"It's 0 / 0 before I
applied the rule.",00:45:03.820,00:45:08.260
"But in order to apply the rule
the second time, it still has",00:45:08.260,00:45:11.290
to be 0 / 0.,00:45:11.290,00:45:12.410
But this one isn't.,00:45:12.410,00:45:14.170
This one is 1 / 0.,00:45:14.170,00:45:19.290
"It's no longer an indeterminate
form.",00:45:19.290,00:45:20.650
It's actually infinite.,00:45:20.650,00:45:22.910
"Either plus or minus, depending
on the sign of the",00:45:22.910,00:45:24.970
denominator.,00:45:24.970,00:45:25.520
"Which is just what
this answer is.",00:45:25.520,00:45:27.970
"So the linear approximation
is safe.",00:45:27.970,00:45:30.550
"And we just applied L'Hopital's
Rule wrong.",00:45:30.550,00:45:35.160
"So the moral of the story here
is look before you L'Hop.",00:45:35.160,00:45:55.760
Alright.,00:45:55.760,00:45:58.260
"Now, let me say one
more thing.",00:45:58.260,00:46:09.850
"I need to pile it on just
a little bit, sorry.",00:46:09.850,00:46:22.900
So don't use it as a crutch.,00:46:22.900,00:46:36.700
"We don't want to just get
ourselves so weak, after being",00:46:36.700,00:46:39.690
"in the hospital for all
this time, that we",00:46:39.690,00:46:41.580
"can't use, I'm sorry.",00:46:41.580,00:46:55.560
"So remember that you shouldn't
have lost your senses.",00:46:55.560,00:47:00.700
"If you have something
like this, so",00:47:00.700,00:47:09.770
we'll do this one here.,00:47:09.770,00:47:12.210
"Suppose you're trying to
understand what this does as x",00:47:12.210,00:47:15.470
goes to infinity.,00:47:15.470,00:47:18.200
"Now, you could L'Hopital's
Rule five",00:47:18.200,00:47:23.770
"times, or four times.",00:47:23.770,00:47:25.700
And get the answer here.,00:47:25.700,00:47:30.040
"But really, you should realize
that the main terms are",00:47:30.040,00:47:33.260
"sitting there right
in front of you.",00:47:33.260,00:47:34.870
"And that there's some
algebra that you can",00:47:34.870,00:47:36.470
do to simplify this.,00:47:36.470,00:47:38.490
"Namely, it's the same as
1 + 2 / x + 1 / x^ 5.",00:47:38.490,00:47:45.450
"And then in the denominator,
well, let's see.",00:47:48.060,00:47:51.510
It's x.,00:47:51.510,00:47:53.110
"So this would be dividing by 1
/ x^ 5 in both numerator and",00:47:53.110,00:47:57.965
denominator.,00:47:57.965,00:47:58.240
"And here you have 1 / x + 2
over, sorry I overshot.",00:47:58.240,00:48:04.410
But that's OK.,00:48:04.410,00:48:06.250
2 / x^ 5 here.,00:48:06.250,00:48:09.110
"So these are the main
term, if you like.",00:48:09.110,00:48:12.650
"And it's the same as 1 / 1 / x,
which is the same as x, and",00:48:12.650,00:48:18.590
it goes to infinity.,00:48:18.590,00:48:21.490
As x goes to infinity.,00:48:21.490,00:48:22.930
"Or, if you like, much more
simply, just x ^ 5 / x^ 4 is",00:48:22.930,00:48:28.040
the main term.,00:48:28.040,00:48:29.230
Which is x.,00:48:29.230,00:48:30.520
Which goes to infinity.,00:48:30.520,00:48:31.590
"So don't forget your basic
algebra when you're doing this",00:48:31.590,00:48:36.110
kind of stuff.,00:48:36.110,00:48:37.210
"Use these things and don't
use L'Hopital's Rule.",00:48:37.210,00:48:40.640
"OK, see you next time.",00:48:40.640,00:48:42.760
