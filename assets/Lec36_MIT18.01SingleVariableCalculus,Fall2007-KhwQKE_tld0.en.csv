"PROFESSOR: Now, today
we are continuing",00:00:21.770,00:00:27.000
with this last unit.,00:00:27.000,00:00:30.090
"Unit 5, continued.",00:00:30.090,00:00:36.650
"The informal title of this unit
is Dealing With Infinity.",00:00:36.650,00:00:48.490
"That's really the extra little
piece that we're putting in to",00:00:48.490,00:00:53.280
"our discussions of things like
limits and integrals.",00:00:53.280,00:01:01.080
"To start out with today, I'd
like to recall for you,",00:01:01.080,00:01:09.680
L'Hopital's Rule.,00:01:09.680,00:01:20.290
"And in keeping with the spirit
here, we're just going to do",00:01:20.290,00:01:23.180
the infinity / infinity case.,00:01:23.180,00:01:32.670
"I stated this a little
differently last time, and I",00:01:32.670,00:01:35.140
want to state it again today.,00:01:35.140,00:01:37.750
"Just to make clear what the
hypotheses are and what the",00:01:37.750,00:01:40.220
conclusion is.,00:01:40.220,00:01:43.880
"We start out with, really,
three hypotheses.",00:01:43.880,00:01:47.350
"Two of them are kind
of obvious.",00:01:47.350,00:01:50.160
"The three hypotheses are that
f (x) tends to infinity, g (",00:01:50.160,00:01:56.020
"x) tends to infinity, that's
what it means to be in this",00:01:56.020,00:02:00.000
infinity / infinity case.,00:02:00.000,00:02:02.380
"And then the last assumption
is that f ' ( x) / g ' (x),",00:02:02.380,00:02:08.160
"tends to a limit, L. And this
is all as x tends to some a.",00:02:08.160,00:02:15.660
Some limit a.,00:02:15.660,00:02:18.180
"And then the conclusion is that
f( x) / g ( x) also tends",00:02:18.180,00:02:27.470
"to L, as x goes to a.",00:02:27.470,00:02:37.260
"Now, so that's the way it is.",00:02:37.260,00:02:38.900
So it's three limits.,00:02:38.900,00:02:40.750
"But presumably these are
obvious, and this one is",00:02:40.750,00:02:43.660
"exactly what we were going
to check anyway.",00:02:43.660,00:02:49.180
Gives us this one limit.,00:02:49.180,00:02:52.790
So that's the statement.,00:02:52.790,00:02:54.390
"And then the other little
interesting point here, which",00:02:54.390,00:02:59.620
"is consistent with this idea of
dealing with infinity, is",00:02:59.620,00:03:03.610
"that a equals plus or minus
infinity and L equals plus or",00:03:03.610,00:03:08.570
minus infinity are OK.,00:03:08.570,00:03:11.590
"That is, the numbers capital L,
the limit capital L and the",00:03:11.590,00:03:15.990
number a can also be infinite.,00:03:15.990,00:03:21.090
"Now in recitation yesterday,
you should have discussed",00:03:21.090,00:03:26.240
"something about rates of growth,
which follow from what",00:03:26.240,00:03:31.830
"I said in lecture last time and
also maybe from some more",00:03:31.830,00:03:35.970
"detailed discussions that
you had in recitation.",00:03:35.970,00:03:40.440
"And I'm going to introduce a
notation to compare functions.",00:03:40.440,00:03:44.130
"Namely, we say that f ( x) is
a lot less than g ( x).",00:03:44.130,00:03:51.270
"So this means that the limit,
as it goes to infinity, this",00:03:51.270,00:03:58.330
tends to 0.,00:03:58.330,00:03:59.280
"As x goes to infinity,
this would be.",00:03:59.280,00:04:04.700
"So this is a notation, a new
notation for us. f is a lot",00:04:04.700,00:04:08.310
less than g.,00:04:08.310,00:04:10.160
"And it's meant to be read
only asymptotically.",00:04:10.160,00:04:13.150
"It's only in the limit
as x goes to",00:04:13.150,00:04:14.890
infinity that this happens.,00:04:14.890,00:04:17.890
"And implicitly here, I'm always
assuming that these are",00:04:17.890,00:04:20.510
"positive quantities. f
and g are positive.",00:04:20.510,00:04:28.130
"What you saw in recitation was
that you can make a systematic",00:04:28.130,00:04:32.230
"comparison of all the standard
functions that we know about.",00:04:32.230,00:04:34.950
"For example, the ln function
goes to infinity.",00:04:34.950,00:04:38.050
"But a lot more slowly
than x to a power.",00:04:38.050,00:04:41.500
A lot more slowly then e^ x.,00:04:41.500,00:04:44.920
"A lot more slowly than,
say, e ^ x ^2.",00:04:44.920,00:04:48.220
So this one is slow.,00:04:48.220,00:04:50.850
This one is moderate.,00:04:50.850,00:04:54.580
"And this one is fast.
And this one is very",00:04:54.580,00:04:57.830
fast. Going to infinity.,00:04:57.830,00:05:02.900
"Tends to infinity, and
this is of course",00:05:02.900,00:05:04.650
as x goes to infinity.,00:05:04.650,00:05:07.570
"All of them go to infinity, but
at quite different rates.",00:05:07.570,00:05:12.270
"And, analogous to this, and
today we're going to be doing",00:05:12.270,00:05:15.630
"this, needing to do this quite
a bit, is rates of decay,",00:05:15.630,00:05:23.530
"which are more or less the
opposite of rates of growth.",00:05:23.530,00:05:26.460
"So rates of decay are rates
at which things tend to 0.",00:05:26.460,00:05:30.270
"So the rate of decay, and for
that I'm just going to take",00:05:30.270,00:05:39.820
reciprocals of these numbers.,00:05:39.820,00:05:41.890
So 1 / ln x tends to 0.,00:05:41.890,00:05:45.820
But rather slowly.,00:05:45.820,00:05:47.260
"It's much bigger
than 1 / x ^ p.",00:05:47.260,00:05:51.220
"Oh, I didn't mention that
this exponent p",00:05:51.220,00:05:53.910
is meant to be positive.,00:05:53.910,00:05:55.750
"That's a convention that I'm
using without saying.",00:05:55.750,00:05:58.360
I should've told you that.,00:05:58.360,00:06:00.310
"So think x ^ 1/2, x ^ 1, x ^2,
they're all in this sort of",00:06:00.310,00:06:06.790
moderate intermediate range.,00:06:06.790,00:06:09.000
"And then that, in turn, goes to
0 but much more slowly then",00:06:09.000,00:06:14.860
"1 / e ^ x, also known
as e^ - x.",00:06:14.860,00:06:19.220
"And that, in turn, this guy
here goes to 0 incredibly",00:06:19.220,00:06:24.220
"fast. e ^ - x ^2 vanishes
really, really fast. So this",00:06:24.220,00:06:33.270
"is a review of the
L'Hopital's Rule.",00:06:33.270,00:06:37.130
"What we said last time, and the
application of it, which",00:06:37.130,00:06:40.140
"is to rates of growth and tells
us what these rates of",00:06:40.140,00:06:43.870
growth are.,00:06:43.870,00:06:50.860
"Today, I want to talk about
improper integrals.",00:06:50.860,00:07:01.830
"And improper integrals, we've
already really seen one or two",00:07:01.830,00:07:07.430
of them on your exercises.,00:07:07.430,00:07:09.050
"And we mention them a
little bit, briefly.",00:07:09.050,00:07:11.950
"I'm just going to go through
them more carefully and more",00:07:11.950,00:07:14.120
systematically now.,00:07:14.120,00:07:15.110
"And we want to get just exactly
what's going on with",00:07:15.110,00:07:18.180
"these rates of decay and
their relationship",00:07:18.180,00:07:20.910
with improper integrals.,00:07:20.910,00:07:21.940
"So I need for you to understand
on the spectrum of",00:07:21.940,00:07:26.490
"the range of functions like
this, which ones are suitable",00:07:26.490,00:07:30.380
"for integration as x
goes to infinity.",00:07:30.380,00:07:38.320
"Well, let's start out
with the definition.",00:07:38.320,00:07:43.130
"The integral from a to infinity
of f(x) dx is, by",00:07:43.130,00:07:47.780
"definition the limit as n goes
to infinity of the ordinary",00:07:47.780,00:07:55.780
"definite integral up to some
fixed, finite level.",00:07:55.780,00:08:00.430
That's the definition.,00:08:00.430,00:08:01.760
"And there's a word that we use
here, which is that we say the",00:08:01.760,00:08:07.550
"integral, so this is terminology
for it, converges",00:08:07.550,00:08:15.150
if the limit exists.,00:08:15.150,00:08:20.560
And diverges if not.,00:08:20.560,00:08:28.630
"Well, these are the key
words for today.",00:08:28.630,00:08:34.340
"So here's the issue that we're
going to be addressing.",00:08:34.340,00:08:39.870
"Which is whether the limit
exists or not.",00:08:39.870,00:08:42.430
"In other words, whether
the integral",00:08:42.430,00:08:44.260
converges or diverges.,00:08:44.260,00:08:50.820
"These notions have a geometric
analog, which you should",00:08:50.820,00:08:54.270
"always be thinking of at
the same time in the",00:08:54.270,00:08:56.320
back of your head.,00:08:56.320,00:08:57.730
"I'll draw a picture of the
function Here it's",00:08:57.730,00:09:00.840
starting out at a.,00:09:00.840,00:09:02.510
"And maybe it's going
down like this.",00:09:02.510,00:09:05.790
"And it's interpreting
it geometrically.",00:09:05.790,00:09:09.840
"This would only work
if f is positive.",00:09:09.840,00:09:15.520
"Then the convergent
case is the case",00:09:15.520,00:09:18.830
where the area is finite.,00:09:18.830,00:09:25.900
"So the total area is finite
under this curve.",00:09:25.900,00:09:29.660
"And the other case is the
total area is infinite.",00:09:29.660,00:09:43.750
"I claim that both of these
things are possible.",00:09:43.750,00:09:46.920
"Although this thing goes on
forever, if you stop it at one",00:09:46.920,00:09:51.910
"stage, n, then of course
it's a finite number.",00:09:51.910,00:09:54.310
"But as you go further and
further and further, there's",00:09:54.310,00:09:56.590
more and more and more area.,00:09:56.590,00:09:58.290
"And there are two
possibilities.",00:09:58.290,00:10:00.420
"Either as you go all the way
out here to infinity, the",00:10:00.420,00:10:04.860
"total that you get adds
up to a finite total.",00:10:04.860,00:10:08.900
"Or else, maybe there's
infinitely much.",00:10:08.900,00:10:11.280
"For instance, if it's a straight
line going across,",00:10:11.280,00:10:13.700
"there's clearly infinitely
much area underneath.",00:10:13.700,00:10:23.340
"So we need to do a bunch
of examples.",00:10:23.340,00:10:25.500
"And that's really our main job
for the day, and to make sure",00:10:25.500,00:10:29.360
"that we know exactly what
to expect in all cases.",00:10:29.360,00:10:34.810
"The first example is the
integral from 0 to infinity of",00:10:34.810,00:10:42.390
e^ - kx dx.,00:10:42.390,00:10:45.410
"Where k is going to be
some positive number.",00:10:45.410,00:10:48.550
Some positive constant.,00:10:48.550,00:10:54.080
"This is the most fundamental,
by far, of",00:10:54.080,00:10:58.670
the definite integrals.,00:10:58.670,00:11:02.970
Improper integrals.,00:11:02.970,00:11:03.710
"And in order to handle this, the
thing that I need to do is",00:11:03.710,00:11:07.370
"to check the integral from
0 up to n. e ^ - kx dx.",00:11:07.370,00:11:13.000
"And since this is an easy
integral to evaluate, we're",00:11:13.000,00:11:16.080
going to do it.,00:11:16.080,00:11:17.650
"It's - 1 / k e ^ - kx, that's
the antiderivative.",00:11:17.650,00:11:22.590
Evaluated at 0 and n.,00:11:22.590,00:11:26.450
"And that, if I plug in these
values, is - 1 / k, e^ - k N.",00:11:26.450,00:11:37.320
"Minus, and if I evaluate it at
0, I get a (- 1 / k) e^ 0.",00:11:37.320,00:11:46.860
So there's the answer.,00:11:46.860,00:11:48.690
"And now we have to think
about what happens",00:11:48.690,00:11:51.120
as n goes to infinity.,00:11:51.120,00:11:54.040
"So as n goes to infinity, what's
happening is the second",00:11:54.040,00:12:00.290
term here stays unchanged.,00:12:00.290,00:12:03.400
"But the first term is e to
some negative power.",00:12:03.400,00:12:06.940
"And the exponent is getting
larger and larger.",00:12:06.940,00:12:08.700
"That's because k is
positive here.",00:12:08.700,00:12:10.830
"You've definitely got
to pay attention.",00:12:10.830,00:12:12.590
"Even though I'm doing this with
general variables here,",00:12:12.590,00:12:15.020
"you've got to pay attention
to signs of things.",00:12:15.020,00:12:17.940
"Because otherwise you'll always
get the wrong answer.",00:12:17.940,00:12:20.130
"So you have to pay very
close attention here.",00:12:20.130,00:12:22.710
"So this is, if you like, e ^
minus infinity in the limit,",00:12:22.710,00:12:25.450
which is 0.,00:12:25.450,00:12:26.720
"And so in the limit, this
thing tends to 0.",00:12:26.720,00:12:30.720
"And this thing is just
equal to 1 / k.",00:12:30.720,00:12:33.870
"And so all told, the answer
is 1 / k And that's it.",00:12:33.870,00:12:43.610
"Now we're going to abbreviate
this a little bit.",00:12:43.610,00:12:46.100
"This thought process, you're
going to have to go through",00:12:46.100,00:12:48.390
every single time you do this.,00:12:48.390,00:12:50.070
"But after a while you also get
good enough at it that you can",00:12:50.070,00:12:53.400
"make it a little bit
less cluttered.",00:12:53.400,00:12:55.770
"So let me show you a shorthand
for this same calculation.",00:12:55.770,00:13:09.350
"Namely, I write 0 to infinity
e ^ - kx dx.",00:13:09.350,00:13:14.650
"And that's equal to - 1 / k
e ^ - kx 0 to infinity.",00:13:14.650,00:13:23.890
That was cute.,00:13:23.890,00:13:27.710
"Not small enough, however.",00:13:27.710,00:13:35.600
"So, here we are.",00:13:35.600,00:13:36.490
"We have the same calculation
as we had before.",00:13:36.490,00:13:38.290
"But now we're thinking, really,
in our minds that this",00:13:38.290,00:13:40.400
"infinity is some very,
very enormous number.",00:13:40.400,00:13:43.100
And we're going to plug it in.,00:13:43.100,00:13:44.790
"And you can either do this
in your head or not.",00:13:44.790,00:13:47.060
You say - 1 / k e^ - infinity.,00:13:47.060,00:13:50.760
"Here's where I've used the
fact that k is positive.",00:13:50.760,00:13:53.510
"Because e ^ - k times a large
number is minus infinity.",00:13:53.510,00:13:57.300
"And then here + 1
/ k - (- 1 / k).",00:13:57.300,00:14:01.090
"Let me write it the same
way I did before.",00:14:01.090,00:14:05.780
"And that's just equal to 0 + 1
/ k, which is what we want.",00:14:05.780,00:14:11.840
"So this is the same calculation,
just slightly",00:14:11.840,00:14:14.470
abbreviated.,00:14:14.470,00:14:17.430
Yeah.,00:14:17.430,00:14:17.740
Question.,00:14:17.740,00:14:18.180
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:14:18.180,00:14:29.050
PROFESSOR: Good question.,00:14:29.050,00:14:30.770
"The question is, what
about the case when",00:14:30.770,00:14:31.960
the limit is infinity?,00:14:31.960,00:14:34.830
"I'm distinguishing between
something existing and its",00:14:34.830,00:14:37.980
limit being infinity here.,00:14:37.980,00:14:39.690
"Whenever I make a discussion
of limits, I say a finite",00:14:39.690,00:14:45.330
"limit, or in this case, it works
for infinite limits.",00:14:45.330,00:14:49.100
"So in other words, when
I say exists, I mean",00:14:49.100,00:14:51.230
exists and is finite.,00:14:51.230,00:14:54.970
"So here, when I say that it
converges and I say the limit",00:14:54.970,00:14:58.190
"exists, what I mean is that
it's a finite number.",00:14:58.190,00:15:00.500
"And so that's indeed
what I said here.",00:15:00.500,00:15:02.630
The total area is finite.,00:15:02.630,00:15:04.570
"And, similarly, over here.",00:15:04.570,00:15:06.100
"I might add, however, that
there is another",00:15:06.100,00:15:08.460
part of this subject.,00:15:08.460,00:15:09.770
Which I'm skipping entirely.,00:15:09.770,00:15:11.410
Which is a little bit subtle.,00:15:11.410,00:15:13.020
Which is the following.,00:15:13.020,00:15:14.330
"If f changes sign, there can
be some cancellation and",00:15:14.330,00:15:18.020
oscillation.,00:15:18.020,00:15:19.040
"And then sometimes the limit
exists, but the total area, if",00:15:19.040,00:15:22.060
"you counted it all positively,
is actually still infinite.",00:15:22.060,00:15:25.680
"And we're going to
avoid that case.",00:15:25.680,00:15:29.120
"We're we're just going to treat
these positive cases.",00:15:29.120,00:15:31.820
"So don't worry about
that for now.",00:15:31.820,00:15:33.460
"That's the next layer of
complexity which we're not",00:15:33.460,00:15:36.080
addressing in this class.,00:15:36.080,00:15:38.450
Another question.,00:15:38.450,00:15:39.140
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:15:39.140,00:15:45.610
"PROFESSOR: The question is,
would this be OK on tests.",00:15:45.610,00:15:48.260
"The answer is, absolutely yes.",00:15:48.260,00:15:49.870
"I want to encourage
you to do this.",00:15:49.870,00:15:51.550
"If you can think about
it correctly.",00:15:51.550,00:15:53.660
"The subtle point is
just, you have to",00:15:53.660,00:15:55.260
plug in infinity correctly.,00:15:55.260,00:15:57.270
"Namely, you have to realize
that this only",00:15:57.270,00:15:59.830
works if k is positive.,00:15:59.830,00:16:01.190
"This is the step where you're
plugging in infinity.",00:16:01.190,00:16:03.240
"And I'm letting you put this
infinity up here as an",00:16:03.240,00:16:06.940
endpoint value.,00:16:06.940,00:16:08.390
"So in fact that's exactly
the theme.",00:16:08.390,00:16:12.470
"The theme is dealing
with infinity here.",00:16:12.470,00:16:16.810
"And I want you to be able
to deal with it.",00:16:16.810,00:16:18.550
That's my goal.,00:16:18.550,00:16:20.440
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:16:20.440,00:16:32.660
"PROFESSOR: OK, so another
question is, so let's be sure",00:16:32.660,00:16:36.180
"here when the limit exists,
I say it has to be finite.",00:16:36.180,00:16:40.640
"That means it's finite,
not infinite.",00:16:40.640,00:16:46.910
The limit can be 0.,00:16:46.910,00:16:48.270
It can also be - 1.,00:16:48.270,00:16:50.790
It can be anything.,00:16:50.790,00:16:51.880
"Doesn't have to be a
positive number.",00:16:51.880,00:16:58.590
Other questions.,00:16:58.590,00:17:04.840
"So we've had our
first example.",00:17:04.840,00:17:07.180
"And now I just want to add one
physical interpretation here.",00:17:07.180,00:17:23.650
"This is Example 1,
if you like.",00:17:23.650,00:17:29.430
"And this is something that was
on your problem set, remember.",00:17:29.430,00:17:32.930
"That we talked about the
probability, or the number, if",00:17:32.930,00:17:36.800
"you like, the number of
particles on average that",00:17:36.800,00:17:47.370
"decay in some radioactive
substance.",00:17:47.370,00:18:02.540
"Say, in time between 0 and some
capital T. And then that",00:18:02.540,00:18:12.840
"would be this integral, 0 to
capital T, some total quantity",00:18:12.840,00:18:21.010
times this integral here.,00:18:21.010,00:18:22.560
"This is the typical kind
of radioactive decay",00:18:22.560,00:18:27.640
number that one gets.,00:18:27.640,00:18:29.800
"Now, in the limit, so this is
some number of particles.",00:18:29.800,00:18:38.620
"If the substance is radioactive,
then in the",00:18:38.620,00:18:41.170
"limit, we have this.",00:18:41.170,00:18:47.610
"Which is equal to the total
number of particles.",00:18:47.610,00:18:56.070
"And that's something that's
going to be important for",00:18:56.070,00:18:58.790
normalizing and understanding.,00:18:58.790,00:19:00.510
"How much does the whole
substance, how many moles do",00:19:00.510,00:19:03.000
we have of this stuff.,00:19:03.000,00:19:04.840
What is it.,00:19:04.840,00:19:05.960
"And so this is a number that
is going to come up.",00:19:05.960,00:19:08.390
"Now, I emphasize that this
notion of T going to infinity",00:19:08.390,00:19:14.040
is just an idealization.,00:19:14.040,00:19:16.890
"We don't really believe that
we're going to wait forever",00:19:16.890,00:19:20.800
for this substance to decay.,00:19:20.800,00:19:23.580
"Nevertheless, as theorists, we
write down this quantity.",00:19:23.580,00:19:27.980
And we use it.,00:19:27.980,00:19:29.110
All the time.,00:19:29.110,00:19:31.970
"Furthermore, there's other good
reasons for using it, and",00:19:31.970,00:19:34.840
"why physicists accept
it immediately.",00:19:34.840,00:19:36.930
"Even though it's not really
completely physically",00:19:36.930,00:19:39.230
"realistic ever to let
time go very, very",00:19:39.230,00:19:41.760
far into the future.,00:19:41.760,00:19:43.890
"And the reason is, if you notice
this answer here, look",00:19:43.890,00:19:47.980
"at how much simpler this number
is, 1 / k, than the",00:19:47.980,00:19:53.860
"numbers that I got in the
intermediate stages here.",00:19:53.860,00:19:57.940
"These are all ugly, the
limits are simple.",00:19:57.940,00:20:01.800
"And this is a theme that
I've been trying to",00:20:01.800,00:20:04.130
emphasize all semester.,00:20:04.130,00:20:05.790
"Namely, that the infinitesimal,
the things that",00:20:05.790,00:20:07.990
"you get when you do
differentiation, are the",00:20:07.990,00:20:09.780
easier formulas.,00:20:09.780,00:20:10.580
"The algebraic ones, the things
in the process of getting to",00:20:10.580,00:20:14.030
"the limit, are the ugly ones.",00:20:14.030,00:20:16.500
"These are the easy ones, these
are the hard ones.",00:20:16.500,00:20:18.650
"So in fact, infinity is
basically easier than any",00:20:18.650,00:20:21.260
finite number.,00:20:21.260,00:20:23.040
"And a lot of appealing formulas
come from those kinds",00:20:23.040,00:20:27.110
of calculations.,00:20:27.110,00:20:28.470
Another question.,00:20:28.470,00:20:31.840
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:20:31.840,00:20:39.310
"PROFESSOR: The question is,
shouldn't the answer be a?",00:20:39.310,00:20:43.040
"Well, the answer turns
out to be a / k.",00:20:43.040,00:20:47.070
"Which means that when you set
up your arithmetic, and you",00:20:47.070,00:20:49.930
"model this to a collection
of particles.",00:20:49.930,00:20:53.750
So you said it should be a.,00:20:53.750,00:20:55.550
"But that's because you
made an assumption.",00:20:55.550,00:20:58.290
"Which was that a was the total
number of particles.",00:20:58.290,00:21:01.190
"But that's just false, right?",00:21:01.190,00:21:03.200
"This is the total number
of particles.",00:21:03.200,00:21:04.810
"So therefore, if you want to set
it up, you want set up so",00:21:04.810,00:21:07.410
"that this number's the total
number of particles.",00:21:07.410,00:21:11.500
"And that's how you set up a
model is, you do all the",00:21:11.500,00:21:13.560
"calculations and you see what
it's coming out to be.",00:21:13.560,00:21:16.040
"And that's why you need to do
this kind of calculation.",00:21:16.040,00:21:24.490
"OK, so.",00:21:24.490,00:21:25.540
"The main thing is, you shouldn't
make assumptions",00:21:25.540,00:21:27.260
about models.,00:21:27.260,00:21:27.710
"You have to follow what the
calculations tell you.",00:21:27.710,00:21:29.950
They're not lying.,00:21:29.950,00:21:32.110
"OK, so now.",00:21:32.110,00:21:34.990
We carried this out.,00:21:34.990,00:21:36.300
"There's one other example which
we talked about earlier",00:21:36.300,00:21:42.210
in the class.,00:21:42.210,00:21:42.830
"And I just wanted to
mention it again.",00:21:42.830,00:21:44.470
"It's probably the most famous
after this one.",00:21:44.470,00:21:48.800
"Namely, the integral from minus
infinity to infinity of",00:21:48.800,00:21:51.510
e^ - x ^2 dx.,00:21:51.510,00:21:53.740
"Which turns out, amazingly, to
be able to be evaluated.",00:21:53.740,00:21:56.930
"It turns out to be the
square root of pi.",00:21:56.930,00:21:59.500
So this one is also great.,00:21:59.500,00:22:04.340
"This is the constant which
allows you to compute all",00:22:04.340,00:22:09.840
"kinds of things in
probability.",00:22:09.840,00:22:12.230
"So this is a key number
in probability.",00:22:12.230,00:22:22.760
"It basically is the key to
understanding things like",00:22:22.760,00:22:25.940
"standard deviation and basically
any other thing in",00:22:25.940,00:22:29.230
the subject of probability.,00:22:29.230,00:22:31.010
"It's also what's driving these
polls that tell you within 4%",00:22:31.010,00:22:37.790
"accuracy we know that
people are going to",00:22:37.790,00:22:40.570
vote this way or that.,00:22:40.570,00:22:42.430
"So in order to interpret all of
those kinds of things, you",00:22:42.430,00:22:44.990
need to know this number.,00:22:44.990,00:22:48.360
"And this number was only
calculated numerically",00:22:48.360,00:22:53.060
"starting in the 1700s or so by
people who, actually, by one",00:22:53.060,00:22:59.570
"guy whose name was de Moivre,
who was selling his services",00:22:59.570,00:23:03.700
"to various royalty who were
running lotteries.",00:23:03.700,00:23:06.390
"In those days they ran
lotteries, too.",00:23:06.390,00:23:09.190
"And he was able to tell them
what the chances were of the",00:23:09.190,00:23:13.750
various games.,00:23:13.750,00:23:15.590
And he worked out this number.,00:23:15.590,00:23:17.720
"He realized that this
was the pattern.",00:23:17.720,00:23:19.780
"Although he didn't know that it
was the square root of pi,",00:23:19.780,00:23:21.730
"he knew it to sufficient
accuracy that he could tell",00:23:21.730,00:23:24.510
"them the correct answer to how
much money their lotteries",00:23:24.510,00:23:27.660
would make.,00:23:27.660,00:23:29.770
"And of course we do this
nowadays, too.",00:23:29.770,00:23:33.070
In all kinds of ways.,00:23:33.070,00:23:34.530
"Including slightly more legit
businesses like insurance.",00:23:34.530,00:23:45.440
"So now, I I'm going to give
you some more examples.",00:23:45.440,00:23:49.920
"And and the other examples are
much more close to the edge",00:23:49.920,00:23:56.130
between infinite and finite.,00:23:56.130,00:23:59.320
"This distinction between
convergence and divergence.",00:23:59.320,00:24:02.500
"And let me just, maybe I'll say
one more word about why we",00:24:02.500,00:24:07.260
"care about this very gross issue
of whether something is",00:24:07.260,00:24:10.810
finite or infinite.,00:24:10.810,00:24:12.630
"When you're talking about
something like this normal",00:24:12.630,00:24:15.640
"curve here, there's an issue of
how far out you have to go",00:24:15.640,00:24:24.290
"before you can ignore
the rest.",00:24:24.290,00:24:29.280
"So we're going to ignore what's
called the tail here.",00:24:29.280,00:24:34.500
"Somehow you want to know that
this is negligible.",00:24:34.500,00:24:36.440
"And you want to know how
negligible it is.",00:24:36.440,00:24:38.790
"And this is the job of a
mathematician, is to know what",00:24:38.790,00:24:42.580
"finite region you have to
consider and which one you're",00:24:42.580,00:24:45.050
"going to carefully calculate
numerically.",00:24:45.050,00:24:47.130
"And then the rest, you're going
to have to take care of",00:24:47.130,00:24:49.030
by some theoretical reasoning.,00:24:49.030,00:24:50.690
"You're going to have to know
that these tails are small",00:24:50.690,00:24:52.830
"enough that they don't matter
in your finite calculation.",00:24:52.830,00:24:57.150
"And so, we care very much
about the tails.",00:24:57.150,00:24:59.070
"Because they're the only
thing that the",00:24:59.070,00:25:00.140
machine won't tell us.,00:25:00.140,00:25:02.700
"So that's the part that
we have to know.",00:25:02.700,00:25:05.090
"And these tails are also
something which are discussed",00:25:05.090,00:25:08.280
"all the time in financial
mathematics.",00:25:08.280,00:25:09.870
"They're very worried
about fat tails.",00:25:09.870,00:25:11.830
"That is, unlikely events that
nevertheless happen sometimes.",00:25:11.830,00:25:16.270
"And they get burned fairly
regularly with them.",00:25:16.270,00:25:18.570
"As they have recently, with
the mortgage scandal.",00:25:18.570,00:25:25.440
"So, these things are pretty
serious and they really are",00:25:25.440,00:25:29.480
"spending a lot of
time on them.",00:25:29.480,00:25:30.540
"Of course, there are lots of
other practical issues besides",00:25:30.540,00:25:33.310
just the mathematics.,00:25:33.310,00:25:34.130
"But you've got to get
the math right, too.",00:25:34.130,00:25:37.340
"So we're going to now talk about
some borderline cases",00:25:37.340,00:25:40.860
for these fat tails.,00:25:40.860,00:25:42.950
"Just how fat do they have to be
before they become infinite",00:25:42.950,00:25:45.820
"and overwhelm the
central bump.",00:25:45.820,00:25:51.820
"So we'll save this for
just a second.",00:25:51.820,00:25:56.120
"And what I'm saving up here is
the borderline case, which I'm",00:25:56.120,00:25:59.310
"going to concentrate on, which
is this moderate rate, which",00:25:59.310,00:26:02.960
is x to powers.,00:26:02.960,00:26:07.500
Here's our next example.,00:26:07.500,00:26:09.570
"I guess we'll call
this Example 3.",00:26:09.570,00:26:13.230
"It's the integral from
1 to infinity dx / x.",00:26:13.230,00:26:17.540
That's the power p = 1.,00:26:17.540,00:26:20.800
"And this turns out to be
a borderline case.",00:26:20.800,00:26:23.980
"So it's worth carrying
out carefully.",00:26:23.980,00:26:26.790
"Now, again I'm going to do
it by the slower method.",00:26:26.790,00:26:29.820
"Rather than the shorthand
method.",00:26:29.820,00:26:31.290
"But ultimately, you can
do it by the short",00:26:31.290,00:26:34.030
method if you'd like.,00:26:34.030,00:26:36.100
"I break it up into an integral
that goes up to some",00:26:36.100,00:26:39.770
"large number, n.",00:26:39.770,00:26:42.580
"I see that its logarithm
function is the",00:26:42.580,00:26:44.940
antiderivative.,00:26:44.940,00:26:47.060
"And so what I get is ln n
- ln 1, which is just 0.",00:26:47.060,00:26:51.740
So this is just log n.,00:26:51.740,00:26:53.180
"In any case, it tends
to infinity",00:26:53.180,00:26:55.450
as n goes to infinity.,00:26:55.450,00:26:57.860
"So the conclusion is, since the
limit is infinite, that",00:26:57.860,00:27:01.660
this thing diverges.,00:27:01.660,00:27:12.020
"Now, I'm going to do this
systematically now with all",00:27:12.020,00:27:17.230
"powers p, to see what happens.",00:27:17.230,00:27:20.830
I'll look at the integral.,00:27:20.830,00:27:22.050
"Sorry, I'm going to have
to start at 1 here.",00:27:22.050,00:27:23.900
"From 1 to infinity, dx
/ x ^p, and see what",00:27:23.900,00:27:28.290
happens with these.,00:27:28.290,00:27:29.480
"And you'll see that p = 1 is
a borderline when I do this",00:27:29.480,00:27:32.570
calculation.,00:27:32.570,00:27:35.720
"This time I'm going to do the
calculation the hard way.",00:27:35.720,00:27:39.060
"But now you're going to have to
think and pay attention to",00:27:39.060,00:27:41.470
see what it is that I'm doing.,00:27:41.470,00:27:43.710
"First of all, I'm going to
take the antiderivative.",00:27:43.710,00:27:45.350
"And this is x ^ - p, so it's
- p + 1 / - p + 1.",00:27:45.350,00:27:53.590
"That's the antiderivative of
the function 1 / x ^ - p.",00:27:53.590,00:28:00.960
"And then I have to evaluate
that at 1 and infinity.",00:28:00.960,00:28:07.710
"So now, I'll write this down.",00:28:07.710,00:28:10.600
"But I'm going to be particularly
careful here.",00:28:10.600,00:28:13.990
I'll write it down.,00:28:13.990,00:28:14.880
"It's infinity to the -
p + 1 / - p + 1 -,",00:28:14.880,00:28:27.040
so I plug in 1 here.,00:28:27.040,00:28:29.160
So I get 1 / - p + 1.,00:28:29.160,00:28:34.870
So this is what I'm getting.,00:28:34.870,00:28:36.440
"Again, what you should be
thinking here is this is a",00:28:36.440,00:28:39.480
"very large number
to this power.",00:28:39.480,00:28:45.410
"Now, there are two cases.",00:28:45.410,00:28:47.770
There are two cases.,00:28:47.770,00:28:48.880
"And they exactly
split at p = 1.",00:28:48.880,00:28:52.530
"When p = 1, this number is 0.",00:28:52.530,00:28:55.280
"This exponent is 0, and in fact
this expression doesn't",00:28:55.280,00:28:57.660
"make any sense because the
denominator is also 0.",00:28:57.660,00:29:01.310
"But for all of the
other values, the",00:29:01.310,00:29:03.610
denominator makes sense.,00:29:03.610,00:29:05.310
"But what's going on is that
this is infinite when this",00:29:05.310,00:29:10.480
"exponent is infinity to
a positive power.",00:29:10.480,00:29:13.420
"And it's 0 when it's infinity
to a negative power.",00:29:13.420,00:29:20.070
"So I'm going to say it
here, and you must",00:29:20.070,00:29:22.210
check this at home.,00:29:22.210,00:29:22.970
"Because this is exactly what
I'm going to ask you",00:29:22.970,00:29:25.240
about on the exam.,00:29:25.240,00:29:27.060
This is it.,00:29:27.060,00:29:28.590
"This type of thing, maybe with
a specific value of p here.",00:29:28.590,00:29:33.360
"When p &lt; 1, this thing
is infinite.",00:29:33.360,00:29:45.660
"On the other hand, when p
&gt; 1, this thing is 0.",00:29:45.660,00:29:53.560
"So when p &gt; 1, this
thing is 0.",00:29:53.560,00:29:59.260
It's just equal to 0.,00:29:59.260,00:30:01.040
"And so the answer
is 1 / p - 1.",00:30:01.040,00:30:09.380
Because that's this number.,00:30:09.380,00:30:10.250
"Minus the quantity
1 / - p + 1.",00:30:10.250,00:30:15.720
This is a finite number here.,00:30:15.720,00:30:17.480
"Notice that the answer would
be weird if this thing went",00:30:17.480,00:30:19.910
away in the p &lt; 1 case.,00:30:19.910,00:30:22.840
"Then it would be a
negative number.",00:30:22.840,00:30:24.740
"It would be a very strange
answer to this question.",00:30:24.740,00:30:28.520
"So, in fact that's
not what happens.",00:30:28.520,00:30:29.920
"What happens is that the answer
doesn't make sense.",00:30:29.920,00:30:32.490
It's infinite.,00:30:32.490,00:30:33.060
"So let me just write this
down again, under here.",00:30:33.060,00:30:35.620
"This is a test in a
particular case.",00:30:35.620,00:30:42.160
And here's the conclusion.,00:30:42.160,00:30:47.190
Ah.,00:30:47.190,00:30:48.060
"No, I'm sorry.",00:30:48.060,00:30:48.610
"I think I was going to write
it over on this board here.",00:30:48.610,00:31:03.760
"So the conclusion is that the
integral from 1 to infinity dx",00:31:03.760,00:31:11.770
/ x^p diverges if p &lt;= 1.,00:31:11.770,00:31:21.000
And converges if p &gt; 1.,00:31:21.000,00:31:33.130
"And in fact, we can actually
evaluate it.",00:31:33.130,00:31:35.550
It's equal to 1 / p - 1.,00:31:35.550,00:31:38.380
"It's got a nice, clean
formula even.",00:31:38.380,00:31:44.050
"Alright, now let
me remind you.",00:31:44.050,00:31:45.820
"So I didn't spell the word
diverges right, did I?",00:31:45.820,00:31:47.870
"Oh no, that's an r.",00:31:47.870,00:31:49.170
I guess that's right.,00:31:49.170,00:31:55.530
Diverges if p &lt;= 1.,00:31:55.530,00:31:57.040
"So really, I needed both of
these arguments, which are",00:31:57.040,00:32:00.310
"sitting above it in
order to do it.",00:32:00.310,00:32:02.310
"Because the second argument
didn't work at all when p = 1",00:32:02.310,00:32:06.510
"because the formula for the
antiderivative is wrong.",00:32:06.510,00:32:09.650
"The formula for the
antiderivative is given by the",00:32:09.650,00:32:11.580
ln function when p = 1.,00:32:11.580,00:32:13.570
"So I had to do this
calculation too.",00:32:13.570,00:32:15.780
"This is the borderline case,
between p &gt; 1 and p &lt; 1.",00:32:15.780,00:32:21.420
"When p &gt; 1, we got
convergence.",00:32:21.420,00:32:23.820
"We could calculate
the integral.",00:32:23.820,00:32:27.140
"When p &lt; 1, when we got
divergence and we calculated",00:32:27.140,00:32:30.290
the integral over there.,00:32:30.290,00:32:31.510
"And here in the borderline case,
we got a logarithm. and",00:32:31.510,00:32:34.430
we also got divergence.,00:32:34.430,00:32:35.940
So it failed at the edge.,00:32:35.940,00:32:39.520
"Now, this takes care
of all the powers.",00:32:39.520,00:32:46.980
"Now, there are a number of
different things that one can",00:32:46.980,00:32:55.120
deduce from this.,00:32:55.120,00:32:58.320
And let me carry them out.,00:32:58.320,00:33:02.390
"So this is more or less
the second thing that",00:33:02.390,00:33:04.465
you'll want to do.,00:33:04.465,00:33:07.030
"And I'm going to emphasize
maybe one aspect of it.",00:33:07.030,00:33:12.440
I guess we'll get rid of this.,00:33:12.440,00:33:14.510
"But it's still the issue that
we're discussing here.",00:33:14.510,00:33:17.500
"Is whether this area
is fat or thin.",00:33:17.500,00:33:20.230
I'll remind you of that.,00:33:20.230,00:33:24.500
So here's the next idea.,00:33:24.500,00:33:29.240
"Something called limit
comparison.",00:33:29.240,00:33:34.250
"Limit comparison is what you're
going to use when,",00:33:34.250,00:33:37.360
"instead of being able actually
to calculate the number, you",00:33:37.360,00:33:41.210
"don't yet know what
the number is.",00:33:41.210,00:33:42.670
"But you can make a comparison to
something whose convergence",00:33:42.670,00:33:45.920
"properties you already
understand.",00:33:45.920,00:33:48.940
"Now, here's the statement.",00:33:48.940,00:33:50.780
"If a function, f, is similar to
a function, asymptotically",00:33:50.780,00:33:57.090
"the same as a function, g, as
x goes to infinity, I'll",00:33:57.090,00:34:00.940
"remind you what that
means in a second.",00:34:00.940,00:34:03.830
"Then the integral starting at
some point out to infinity of",00:34:03.830,00:34:10.130
"f(x) dx, and the other
one, converge and",00:34:10.130,00:34:20.900
diverge at the same time.,00:34:20.900,00:34:22.230
"So both, either, either
-- sorry, let's try",00:34:22.230,00:34:29.740
it the other way.,00:34:29.740,00:34:30.320
"Either, both.",00:34:30.320,00:34:31.940
"Either both converge,
or both diverge.",00:34:31.940,00:34:42.700
"They behave exactly
the same way.",00:34:42.700,00:34:44.840
"In terms of whether they're
infinite or not.",00:34:44.840,00:34:50.800
"And, let me remind you what
this tilde means.",00:34:50.800,00:34:56.650
"This thing means that f(
x) / g ( x) tends to 1.",00:34:56.650,00:35:14.750
"So if you have a couple of
functions like that, then",00:35:14.750,00:35:20.270
their behavior is the same.,00:35:20.270,00:35:21.990
This is more or less obvious.,00:35:21.990,00:35:25.050
"It's just because far enough
out, this is for",00:35:25.050,00:35:30.120
"large a, if you like.",00:35:30.120,00:35:35.020
"We're not paying any attention
to what happens.",00:35:35.020,00:35:36.670
"It just has to do with the tail,
and after a while f ( x)",00:35:36.670,00:35:40.560
"and g(x) are comparable
to each other.",00:35:40.560,00:35:42.290
"So their integrals are
comparable to each other.",00:35:42.290,00:35:46.980
"So let's just do a couple
of examples here.",00:35:46.980,00:35:51.290
"If you take the integral from 0
to infinity dx / the square",00:35:51.290,00:35:56.500
"root of x ^2 + 10, then I claim
that the square root of",00:35:56.500,00:36:07.140
"x^2 + 10 resembles the square
root of x ^2, which is just x.",00:36:07.140,00:36:16.220
"So this thing is going
to be like.",00:36:16.220,00:36:19.090
"So now I'm going to have to
do one thing to you here.",00:36:19.090,00:36:22.570
"Which is, I'm going to
change this to 1.",00:36:22.570,00:36:26.180
"To infinity. dx /x And the
reason is that this x = 0 is",00:36:26.180,00:36:35.210
extraneous.,00:36:35.210,00:36:35.870
"Doesn't have anything to
do with what's going",00:36:35.870,00:36:37.680
on with this problem.,00:36:37.680,00:36:39.710
"This guy here, the piece of it
from, so we're going to ignore",00:36:39.710,00:36:48.440
"the part integral from 0 to 1 dx
/ square root of x ^2 + 10,",00:36:48.440,00:36:57.060
which is finite anyway.,00:36:57.060,00:37:01.480
And unimportant.,00:37:01.480,00:37:03.340
"Whereas, unfortunately, the
integral of dx will have a",00:37:03.340,00:37:06.640
singularity at x = 0.,00:37:06.640,00:37:08.310
"So we can't make the
comparison there.",00:37:08.310,00:37:12.040
"Anyway, this one is infinite.",00:37:12.040,00:37:14.910
So this is divergence.,00:37:14.910,00:37:21.490
Using what I knew from before.,00:37:21.490,00:37:27.600
Yeah.,00:37:27.600,00:37:27.840
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:37:27.840,00:37:33.680
"PROFESSOR: The question is, why
did we switch from 0 to 1?",00:37:33.680,00:37:39.770
"So I'm going to say a little
bit more about that later.",00:37:39.770,00:37:43.280
"But let me just make
it a warning here.",00:37:43.280,00:37:48.750
"Which is that this guy here is
infinite for other reasons.",00:37:48.750,00:37:58.010
Unrelated reasons.,00:37:58.010,00:38:04.310
"The comparison that we are
trying to make is with the",00:38:04.310,00:38:06.830
tail as x goes to infinity.,00:38:06.830,00:38:09.400
"So another way of saying this
is that I should stick an a",00:38:09.400,00:38:12.820
"here and an a here and
stay away from 0.",00:38:12.820,00:38:16.940
"So, say a = 1.",00:38:16.940,00:38:18.770
"If I make these both 1,
that would be OK.",00:38:18.770,00:38:21.820
"If I make them both 2,
that would be OK.",00:38:21.820,00:38:24.700
"If I make them both 100,
that would be OK.",00:38:24.700,00:38:27.250
"So let's leave it as
100 right now.",00:38:27.250,00:38:29.450
And it's acceptable.,00:38:29.450,00:38:30.640
"I want you to stay away
from the origin here.",00:38:30.640,00:38:33.360
"Because that's another
bad point.",00:38:33.360,00:38:36.820
"And just talk about what's
happening with the tail.",00:38:36.820,00:38:40.380
"So this is a tail, and I
also had a different",00:38:40.380,00:38:44.860
name for it up top.,00:38:44.860,00:38:46.580
Which is emphasizing this.,00:38:46.580,00:38:47.810
Which is limit comparison.,00:38:47.810,00:38:49.770
"It's only what's happening at
the very end of the picture",00:38:49.770,00:38:52.740
that we're interested in.,00:38:52.740,00:38:53.920
"So again, this is as
x goes to infinity.",00:38:53.920,00:38:56.710
"That's the limit we're talking
about, the limiting behavior.",00:38:56.710,00:38:59.880
"And we're trying not to pay
attention to what's happening",00:38:59.880,00:39:02.430
for small values of x.,00:39:02.430,00:39:10.890
"So to be consistent, if I'm
going to do it up to 100 I'm",00:39:10.890,00:39:14.090
"ignoring what's happening up
to the first 100 values.",00:39:14.090,00:39:25.240
"In any case, this
guy diverged.",00:39:25.240,00:39:28.950
"And let me give you
another example.",00:39:28.950,00:39:33.120
"This one, you could
have computed.",00:39:33.120,00:39:36.050
"This one you could have
computed, right?",00:39:36.050,00:39:38.040
"Because it's a square root of
quadratic, so there's a trig",00:39:38.040,00:39:44.590
"substitution that evaluates
this one.",00:39:44.590,00:39:48.420
"The advantage of this limit
comparison method is, it makes",00:39:48.420,00:39:52.330
"no difference whether you can
compute the thing or not.",00:39:52.330,00:39:54.640
"You can still decide whether
it's finite or infinite,",00:39:54.640,00:39:57.440
fairly easily.,00:39:57.440,00:39:58.820
"So let me give you an
example of that.",00:39:58.820,00:40:10.850
"So here we have another
example.",00:40:10.850,00:40:13.030
"We'll take the integral dx
/ square root of x^3 + 3.",00:40:13.030,00:40:21.560
"Let's say, for the
sake of argument.",00:40:21.560,00:40:25.080
From 0 to infinity.,00:40:25.080,00:40:28.970
"Let's leave off, let's make it
10 to infinity, whatever.",00:40:28.970,00:40:35.200
"Now this one is problematic
for you.",00:40:35.200,00:40:42.360
"You're not going to be able
to evaluate it, I promise.",00:40:42.360,00:40:44.910
"So on the other hand 1 / the
square root of x^3 + 3 is",00:40:44.910,00:40:53.660
"similar to 1 / the square root
of x ^3, which is 1 / x ^ 3/2.",00:40:53.660,00:41:00.580
"So this thing is going to
resemble this integral here.",00:41:00.580,00:41:10.680
Which is convergent.,00:41:10.680,00:41:16.870
According to our rule.,00:41:16.870,00:41:25.660
"So those are the, more or less
the main ingredients.",00:41:25.660,00:41:31.950
"Let me just mention one other
integral, which was the one",00:41:31.950,00:41:36.280
that we had over here.,00:41:36.280,00:41:37.900
This one here.,00:41:37.900,00:41:39.830
"If you look at this integral, of
course we can compute it so",00:41:39.830,00:41:43.130
we know the area is finite.,00:41:43.130,00:41:45.270
"But the way that you would
actually carry this out, if",00:41:45.270,00:41:52.000
"you didn't know the number and
you wanted to check that this",00:41:52.000,00:41:55.680
"integral were finite, then you
would make the following",00:41:55.680,00:42:00.200
comparison.,00:42:00.200,00:42:00.880
This one is not so difficult.,00:42:00.880,00:42:02.710
"First of all, you would write it
as twice the integral from",00:42:02.710,00:42:06.220
0 to infinity of e^ - x ^2 dx.,00:42:06.220,00:42:11.770
"This is a new example here, and
we're just checking for",00:42:11.770,00:42:15.800
convergence only.,00:42:15.800,00:42:18.970
Not evaluation.,00:42:18.970,00:42:25.700
"And now, I'm going to make a
comparison here, Rather than a",00:42:25.700,00:42:37.120
"limit, comparison I'm actually
just going to make an ordinary",00:42:37.120,00:42:39.380
comparison.,00:42:39.380,00:42:39.810
"That's because this thing
vanishes so fast. It's so",00:42:39.810,00:42:42.530
"favorable that we can only put
something on top of it, we",00:42:42.530,00:42:45.330
"can't get something underneath
it that exactly",00:42:45.330,00:42:47.090
balances with it.,00:42:47.090,00:42:48.280
"In other words, this wiggle was
something which had the",00:42:48.280,00:42:50.700
"same growth rate as the
function involved.",00:42:50.700,00:42:53.050
"This thing just vanishes
incredibly fast. It's great.",00:42:53.050,00:42:55.830
"It's too good for us,
for this comparison.",00:42:55.830,00:42:58.500
"So instead what I'm going
to make is the following",00:42:58.500,00:43:00.970
"comparison. e ^ - x
^2 &lt; = e ^ - x.",00:43:00.970,00:43:07.650
At least for x &gt;= 1.,00:43:07.650,00:43:10.990
"When x &gt; = 1, then x ^2 &gt;=
x, and so - x ^2 &lt; - x.",00:43:10.990,00:43:20.150
"And so e^ - x^2 is
less than this.",00:43:20.150,00:43:22.830
"So this is the reasoning
involved.",00:43:22.830,00:43:26.440
"And so what we have here
is two pieces.",00:43:26.440,00:43:29.350
"We have 2, the integral from
0 to 1, of e^ - x ^2.",00:43:29.350,00:43:33.460
That's just a finite part.,00:43:33.460,00:43:35.430
"And then we have this other
part, which I'm going to",00:43:35.430,00:43:38.340
replace with the e ^ - x here.,00:43:38.340,00:43:42.490
"2 times 1 to infinity
e ^ -x dx.",00:43:42.490,00:43:50.310
"So this is, if you like,
this is ordinary",00:43:50.310,00:43:53.460
comparison of integrals.,00:43:53.460,00:43:54.480
"It's something that we did way
at the beginning of the class.",00:43:54.480,00:43:57.010
"Or much earlier on, when we were
dealing with integrals.",00:43:57.010,00:43:59.750
"Which is that if you have a
larger integrand, then the",00:43:59.750,00:44:04.940
integral gets larger.,00:44:04.940,00:44:07.630
"So we've replaced
the integral.",00:44:07.630,00:44:08.810
"We've got the same integrand
on 0 to 1.",00:44:08.810,00:44:11.360
"And we have a larger integrand
on, so this",00:44:11.360,00:44:14.370
one is larger integrand.,00:44:14.370,00:44:20.680
"And this one we know
is finite.",00:44:20.680,00:44:23.200
"This one is a convergent
integral.",00:44:23.200,00:44:24.830
"So the whole business
is convergent.",00:44:24.830,00:44:29.760
"But of course we replaced it
by a much larger thing.",00:44:29.760,00:44:31.970
"So we're not getting the right
number out of this.",00:44:31.970,00:44:33.600
"We're just showing that
it converges.",00:44:33.600,00:44:47.920
"So these are the main
ingredients.",00:44:47.920,00:44:51.060
"As I say, once the thing gets
really, really fast decaying,",00:44:51.060,00:44:54.380
it's relatively straightforward.,00:44:54.380,00:44:57.310
"There's lots of room to show
that it converges.",00:44:57.310,00:45:04.790
"Now, there's one last item of
business here which I have to",00:45:04.790,00:45:08.520
promise you.,00:45:08.520,00:45:10.080
"Which I promised you, which had
to do with dealing with",00:45:10.080,00:45:16.860
this bottom piece here.,00:45:16.860,00:45:22.220
"So I have to deal with what
happens when there's a",00:45:22.220,00:45:25.300
singularity.,00:45:25.300,00:45:26.050
"This is known as an improper
integral of the second type.",00:45:26.050,00:45:56.800
"And the idea of these examples
is the following.",00:45:56.800,00:46:01.200
"You might have something
like this.",00:46:01.200,00:46:06.010
Something like this.,00:46:06.010,00:46:11.200
Or something like this.,00:46:11.200,00:46:16.770
"These are typical sorts
of examples.",00:46:16.770,00:46:20.690
"And before actually describing
what happens, I",00:46:20.690,00:46:27.510
just want to mention.,00:46:27.510,00:46:28.540
"So first of all, the key point
here is you can just calculate",00:46:28.540,00:46:32.130
these things.,00:46:32.130,00:46:32.760
"And plug in 0 and it works and
you'll get the right answer.",00:46:32.760,00:46:37.940
"So you'll determine, you'll
figure out, that it turns out",00:46:37.940,00:46:41.050
"that this one will converge,
this one will diverge, and",00:46:41.050,00:46:43.190
this one will diverge.,00:46:43.190,00:46:44.120
"That's what will turn
out to happen.",00:46:44.120,00:46:46.340
"However, I want to warn you that
you can fool yourself.",00:46:46.340,00:46:50.610
"And so let me give you a
slightly different example.",00:46:50.610,00:46:53.150
"Let's consider this
integral here.",00:46:53.150,00:46:58.410
"The integral from -
1 to 1 dx / x ^2.",00:46:58.410,00:47:05.850
"If you carry out this integral
without thinking, what will",00:47:05.850,00:47:09.690
"happen is, you'll get the
antiderivative, which is - x ^",00:47:09.690,00:47:12.870
"-1, evaluated at - 1 and 1.",00:47:12.870,00:47:16.250
And you plug it in.,00:47:16.250,00:47:20.550
And what do you get?,00:47:20.550,00:47:21.520
"You get - 1 (1 ^ - 1) -,
uh-oh. (- ( -1) ^ - 1).",00:47:21.520,00:47:30.880
"There's a lot of - 1's
in this problem.",00:47:30.880,00:47:33.610
"OK, so that's - 1.",00:47:33.610,00:47:35.090
"And this one, if you work it all
out, as I sometimes don't",00:47:35.090,00:47:37.780
"get the signs right, but this
time I really paid attention.",00:47:37.780,00:47:41.160
"It's - 1, I'm telling you
that's what it is.",00:47:41.160,00:47:44.480
So that comes out to be - 2.,00:47:44.480,00:47:46.880
"Now, this is ridiculous.",00:47:46.880,00:47:50.450
"This function here
looks like this.",00:47:50.450,00:48:01.400
"It's positive, right?",00:48:01.400,00:48:03.640
1 / x ^2 is positive.,00:48:03.640,00:48:06.000
"How exactly is it that the area
between - 1 and 1 came",00:48:06.000,00:48:10.290
out to be a negative number?,00:48:10.290,00:48:13.990
That can't be.,00:48:13.990,00:48:16.510
"There was clearly something
wrong with this.",00:48:16.510,00:48:18.420
"And this is the kind of thing
that you'll get regularly if",00:48:18.420,00:48:21.440
"you don't pay attention to
convergence of integrals.",00:48:21.440,00:48:25.740
"So what's going on here is
actually that this area in",00:48:25.740,00:48:29.360
here is infinite.,00:48:29.360,00:48:33.130
"And this calculation that
I made is nonsense.",00:48:33.130,00:48:38.090
So it doesn't work.,00:48:38.090,00:48:41.060
This is wrong.,00:48:41.060,00:48:42.010
Because it's divergent.,00:48:42.010,00:48:50.240
"Actually, when you get to
imaginary numbers, it'll turn",00:48:50.240,00:48:52.490
"out that there's a way
of rescuing it.",00:48:52.490,00:48:56.710
"But, still, it means something
totally different when that",00:48:56.710,00:48:59.450
"integral is thought
to be at - 2.",00:48:59.450,00:49:03.160
So.,00:49:03.160,00:49:04.000
"What I want you to do here, so
I think we'll have to finish",00:49:04.000,00:49:08.865
"this up very briefly
next time.",00:49:08.865,00:49:11.590
"We'll do these three
calculations and you'll see",00:49:11.590,00:49:14.340
"that these two guys
are divergent",00:49:14.340,00:49:19.910
and this one converges.,00:49:19.910,00:49:21.990
And we'll do that next time.,00:49:21.990,00:49:24.110
