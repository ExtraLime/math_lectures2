"So we're talking about
joint distributions, right?",00:00:00.232,00:00:02.730
"And there's a lot more to do with that,
so to just continue.",00:00:02.730,00:00:06.580
"So last time, we calculated the expected
distance between two iid uniforms, okay?",00:00:06.580,00:00:14.529
"So I wanted to do this analagous
problem for the normal.",00:00:14.529,00:00:18.599
"Because I think that's another nice
related example that has a different",00:00:18.599,00:00:23.390
"approach that makes it easier, okay?",00:00:23.390,00:00:26.200
"So last time,
we did expected absolute difference.",00:00:26.200,00:00:30.250
"This is just an example, but
I think it's a nice example.",00:00:30.250,00:00:33.452
"Expected absolute difference
between two uniforms, and",00:00:33.452,00:00:36.874
"what if we wanna do the same
thing with normals?",00:00:36.874,00:00:40.410
"So we wanna find
the expected value of say,",00:00:40.410,00:00:44.754
let's call them Z1 and Z2.,00:00:44.754,00:00:50.250
"So, we did this with uniform last time,
now assume these are iid standard normal.",00:00:50.250,00:00:56.401
"Okay, wo last time we did this for
uniform,",00:00:59.471,00:01:02.013
"using the 2D version of LOTUS, right?",00:01:02.013,00:01:04.715
"Completely analogous to LOTUS,",00:01:04.715,00:01:06.745
"except we had a double integral
instead of a single integral.",00:01:06.745,00:01:10.521
So these are iid standard normal.,00:01:10.521,00:01:16.341
"So, we could write down the 2D LOTUS here,
and try to do that integral.",00:01:16.341,00:01:23.806
"And because they're iid,
the joint PDF of Z1 and",00:01:23.806,00:01:27.170
"Z2 is just the product of
the two marginal PDFs.",00:01:27.170,00:01:30.474
"And well,
we could just try to do that integral, and",00:01:30.474,00:01:33.634
we could probably get it with some effort.,00:01:33.634,00:01:36.720
"But that's not a good way to do this
problem, it's better to stop and",00:01:36.720,00:01:40.940
"think about the structure of the problem,
okay?",00:01:40.940,00:01:44.140
"So in the case of the uniforms,
we've never particularly studied,",00:01:44.140,00:01:49.290
"what are the properties of
the difference of two uniforms?",00:01:49.290,00:01:52.080
"On the other hand,",00:01:52.080,00:01:52.700
"the difference of normals is
something we've talked about before.",00:01:52.700,00:01:55.990
"So instead of jumping right into
this two-dimensional thing,",00:01:55.990,00:01:58.220
"let's see if we can actually
simplify the problem first.",00:01:58.220,00:02:00.848
"So in fact, we've mentioned before that
the sum of independent normals is normal.",00:02:00.848,00:02:07.376
"We haven't proven that yet, but",00:02:07.376,00:02:09.203
"we have all the tools to
be able to prove that now.",00:02:09.203,00:02:11.885
"So let's just do that quickly
to verify what I said before",00:02:11.885,00:02:17.381
"about the sum of normals,
so just a little theorem.",00:02:17.381,00:02:22.600
"This is gonna be easy now,
because we know MGFs.",00:02:22.600,00:02:25.430
"The sum of normals, so
we stated this before.",00:02:26.790,00:02:29.946
"If X is, let's say N(mu 1,
sigma 1 squared), and",00:02:29.946,00:02:34.941
"y is N(mu 2, sigma 2 squared) and
they're independent,",00:02:34.941,00:02:40.605
"X has to be independent of Y,
otherwise this won't work.",00:02:44.411,00:02:47.111
"Then the sum, we talked about this before,",00:02:47.111,00:02:52.671
"by linearity the means just add, and",00:02:52.671,00:02:57.331
also the variances add.,00:02:57.331,00:03:00.504
"And we talked about the fact
that if we took a difference,",00:03:00.504,00:03:03.624
we would take the difference of means.,00:03:03.624,00:03:05.774
"But we would still add the variances,
not subtract.",00:03:05.774,00:03:08.590
"Because if this were -Y, you would
just think of it as plus -Y, okay?",00:03:08.590,00:03:14.070
"So anyway, let's just prove this fact now,
which we haven't done yet,",00:03:14.070,00:03:20.370
and this is just an easy MGF calculation.,00:03:20.370,00:03:23.332
"So we just use the MGFs, So
let's get the MGF of X + Y.",00:03:23.332,00:03:33.670
"Since they're independent, we talked
about the fact that since they're",00:03:33.670,00:03:37.408
"independent ,we can just multiple
the MGF of X times the MGF of Y.",00:03:37.408,00:03:40.680
"The MGF of a normal, well, we derived
the MGF of a standard normal before.",00:03:40.680,00:03:45.947
"But it's very easy to get from
a standard normal to any normal, right?",00:03:45.947,00:03:49.081
"If we do this thing, mu + sigma z, we can
immediately get the MGF of any normal.",00:03:49.081,00:03:54.202
"And that's just gonna be e to the mu 1 t,",00:03:54.202,00:03:58.916
"this is the MGF of x, mu 1 t,",00:03:58.916,00:04:02.241
+ one-half sigma 1 squared t squared.,00:04:02.241,00:04:07.850
That's the MGF of X.,00:04:07.850,00:04:10.520
"We multiply by the MGF of Y,
which is the same thing,",00:04:10.520,00:04:13.513
you just change the subscripts.,00:04:13.513,00:04:15.442
"Mu 2 t + one-half sigma 2
squared t squared equals,",00:04:15.442,00:04:21.394
"Now let's just write this as
one exponential and factor.",00:04:23.892,00:04:28.220
"So that's e to the mu 1 + mu 2 t,
just factor out",00:04:28.220,00:04:33.084
"the t + one-half,
this is all up in the exponent.",00:04:33.084,00:04:38.213
"One-half t squared (sigma 1
squared + sigma 2 squared), right?",00:04:38.213,00:04:43.941
"Sigma 1 squared plus sigma
2 squared t squared.",00:04:43.941,00:04:47.680
"Okay well, I ran out of space on this
board, but that's the end of the proof.",00:04:48.890,00:04:52.720
"Because all we have to do is just say,
look, that's the MGF.",00:04:52.720,00:04:57.757
"I have little more space,
that's the MGF of N(mu 1 + mu 2,",00:04:57.757,00:05:02.437
"sigma 1 squared + sigma 2 squared),
All right, so since the MGF determines",00:05:02.437,00:05:09.693
"the distribution, then that's the end,
we don't have to do anything else.",00:05:09.693,00:05:13.170
"So, it's a very easy calculation,
using MGFs.",00:05:13.170,00:05:17.026
"Okay, so now that we've proven that fact,
and we see this thing, z1- z2.",00:05:17.026,00:05:22.929
"Rather than jumping into the 2D LOTUS,
let's just say, what is that?",00:05:22.929,00:05:27.270
Well note that Z1- Z2 is,00:05:27.270,00:05:32.468
"N(0, 2), just add the variances.",00:05:32.468,00:05:38.750
"So really all we're asking is for
the expected value of,",00:05:40.060,00:05:44.904
"Expected value of absolute value of,
now when we say N(0, 2),",00:05:47.805,00:05:51.911
"let's once again think about that
as location and scale, right?",00:05:51.911,00:05:56.200
"We could take a standard normal, and
multiply by the square root of 2, and",00:05:56.200,00:05:59.710
that would give us variance 2.,00:05:59.710,00:06:00.900
"So the easiest way to think
of this is as square root",00:06:00.900,00:06:05.698
"of 2 times Z,
where Z is standard normal, right?",00:06:05.698,00:06:10.626
"That's just the scale,
that gives it variance 2.",00:06:10.626,00:06:14.324
Now this is just square root of 2 E|Z|.,00:06:14.324,00:06:21.457
Now its just a one-dimensional LOTUS.,00:06:21.457,00:06:24.451
"And this is a LOTUS that
you've actually seen.",00:06:24.451,00:06:26.799
"If you studied strategic practice five,
we did this.",00:06:26.799,00:06:29.959
"But whether you remember
ever looking at that or not,",00:06:29.959,00:06:32.974
"doesn't matter, this is a easy LOTUS.",00:06:32.974,00:06:35.256
"Whereas here, you have to do a double
integral, here I just write down LOTUS.",00:06:35.256,00:06:39.195
"So I'll do this quickly,
cuz on the strategic practice,",00:06:39.195,00:06:42.199
it's just write down LOTUS.,00:06:42.199,00:06:43.743
"Integral minus infinity,",00:06:43.743,00:06:47.676
to infinity |z| 1 over root 2 pi e,00:06:47.676,00:06:52.806
"to -z squared over 2 dz, And",00:06:52.806,00:06:59.128
"notice that this is an even function,",00:06:59.128,00:07:04.494
"That is, if we replace z by -z,
we get the same thing.",00:07:08.955,00:07:11.949
"So we can just multiply by 2 and
go from 0 to infinity.",00:07:11.949,00:07:17.502
"And once we go from zero to infinity,
we can drop the absolute values.",00:07:17.502,00:07:20.960
"Then it's just z e to
the minus z squared over 2.",00:07:20.960,00:07:23.180
"That's a really easy
u-substitution integral, right,",00:07:23.180,00:07:26.049
"cuz you can just let u equals z squared,
or u equals z squared over 2 if you like.",00:07:26.049,00:07:30.060
"And then you get exactly what you want,
so that's then an easy integral.",00:07:30.060,00:07:34.277
"And if you simplify it,
you get square root 2 over pi,",00:07:34.277,00:07:37.821
which should be an easy calculation.,00:07:37.821,00:07:40.301
"It's also on the strategic practice, so I
won't write out more of that calculation.",00:07:40.301,00:07:45.200
"So then that becomes just
a simple one-dimensional LOTUS,",00:07:45.200,00:07:49.471
that's a much better way to think of it.,00:07:49.471,00:07:52.327
"All right, so just an example that you
don't always have to jump into the 2D",00:07:52.327,00:07:56.838
"LOTUS, just cuz you have this
function of two variables.",00:07:56.838,00:08:00.310
"Okay, so that's a continuous example.",00:08:01.990,00:08:05.342
I wanted to do some more discrete stuff.,00:08:05.342,00:08:09.270
"In particular,
to introduce the multinomial distribution.",00:08:09.270,00:08:15.802
"Which is by far the most important
discrete multivariate distribution, and",00:08:17.841,00:08:22.438
"I'll tell you multivariate
distribution means.",00:08:22.438,00:08:25.490
"So this is gonna be
called the multinomial.",00:08:25.490,00:08:27.285
"A multivariate distribution just
means that's a joint distribution for",00:08:29.952,00:08:35.532
"more than one random variable, right?",00:08:35.532,00:08:38.597
"So we have all these normals and
Poisson and geometric, and so on.",00:08:38.597,00:08:45.421
"Those are all univariate distributions,
cuz we have one random variable.",00:08:45.421,00:08:48.420
"Now we're working with more than
one random variable at once.",00:08:48.420,00:08:51.510
"And for this course, there's really only
two multivariate distributions that you",00:08:51.510,00:08:56.034
need to know by name.,00:08:56.034,00:08:57.189
"One is the multinomial,
which we are about to do.",00:08:57.189,00:09:00.733
"The other one is the multinomial which
is the generalization of the normal",00:09:00.733,00:09:04.914
"distribution to higher dimensions,
and we'll get to that one later, okay?",00:09:04.914,00:09:09.373
"So multinomial as the name might suggest
it's a generalization of the binomial,",00:09:09.373,00:09:15.155
right?,00:09:15.155,00:09:15.753
"Bi becomes multi, okay?",00:09:15.753,00:09:17.693
"So it's like a higher dimensional
version of the binomial,",00:09:17.693,00:09:22.621
and let's just introduce it by its story.,00:09:22.621,00:09:26.110
"So this is the definition and
story, Of the multinomial,",00:09:26.110,00:09:33.764
"which I'll sometimes just
abbreviate to mult of np.",00:09:33.764,00:09:38.679
"It has to parameters,
n and p like the binomial,",00:09:38.679,00:09:43.330
"except in this case,
this p is actually a vector.",00:09:43.330,00:09:48.105
"So p = vector, let's say P1 through Pk,",00:09:48.105,00:09:52.140
"where we assume that that's
a probability vector.",00:09:52.140,00:09:57.081
"And by probability vector all,
I mean is that these are non negative and",00:09:59.399,00:10:03.388
add up to 1.,00:10:03.388,00:10:04.130
"Cuz we're gonna think of them as
probabilities for disjoint cases,",00:10:04.130,00:10:08.133
so that encompasses all possibilities.,00:10:08.133,00:10:10.556
"So we want pj greater than or equal to 0,",00:10:10.556,00:10:15.400
and the sum of all pj's = 1.,00:10:15.400,00:10:18.964
"That's the assumption, okay?",00:10:18.964,00:10:20.744
"So the binomial would just be
if this is one dimensional and",00:10:20.744,00:10:24.231
"then we just have binomial np,
but now we have k of them.",00:10:24.231,00:10:27.588
"So the intuition is that in the binomial,",00:10:27.588,00:10:30.498
"we just talked about success and
failure, right?",00:10:30.498,00:10:34.087
"There are two possible outcomes,
there are two categories.",00:10:34.087,00:10:38.021
"Multinomial means instead of two
categories, we have k categories, okay?",00:10:38.021,00:10:44.708
"So it's a natural extension, right?",00:10:44.708,00:10:46.832
"And binomial, we have to classify
everything as either success or",00:10:46.832,00:10:50.426
failure for each trial.,00:10:50.426,00:10:51.783
"Here we have more than two
possible result, okay?",00:10:51.783,00:10:56.265
So we say that x is,00:10:56.265,00:11:00.521
"multinomial np,",00:11:00.521,00:11:05.082
"We think of that as saying that, so",00:11:09.015,00:11:13.524
"in this case, X is also a vector.",00:11:13.524,00:11:17.884
This is a multivaried distribution so,00:11:17.884,00:11:22.140
"X = (X1 to Xk), if we can think of X.",00:11:22.140,00:11:26.532
"So like in the binomial,
we have n independent trials.",00:11:26.532,00:11:30.030
"But I'll just call them objects
instead of trials and each object,",00:11:34.067,00:11:38.300
"objects could be people, could be trials,
could be anything, so just very general.",00:11:38.300,00:11:43.733
"We have n objects that we
are categorizing, okay?",00:11:43.733,00:11:48.060
"We have n objects, which we are
independently putting into k categories.",00:11:48.060,00:11:55.576
"So there are k possible categories, and
the binomial is just success or failure,",00:11:56.806,00:12:00.675
but now we have k categories.,00:12:00.675,00:12:02.087
"And there,",00:12:06.172,00:12:06.878
"each object is independently determined
which category it falls into, okay?",00:12:06.878,00:12:11.621
"Just like in the binomial,
we had independent Bernoulli trials.",00:12:11.621,00:12:15.172
"And if Pj is the probability
of category j,",00:12:15.172,00:12:20.032
"by P of category j,
I mean the probability that any one",00:12:20.032,00:12:26.107
"of these objects is in category j,
has probability Pj.",00:12:26.107,00:12:32.461
"And we interpret Xj is just the count,",00:12:32.461,00:12:37.408
is the number of objects in category j.,00:12:37.408,00:12:42.517
"All right, so that was a lot of writing,
but the concept is really simple.",00:12:42.517,00:12:45.641
"We just have n things that we're
breaking them into categories, and",00:12:45.641,00:12:49.033
"then we just see how many objects
are in each category, right?",00:12:49.033,00:12:52.142
"So it's very natural, you can make up
as many examples of this as you want,",00:12:52.142,00:12:56.741
"really easily, right?",00:12:56.741,00:12:58.283
"Just anytime you're classifying
things into categories.",00:12:58.283,00:13:00.923
"It's very, very general.",00:13:00.923,00:13:03.477
"Okay, so let's find the PMF.",00:13:03.477,00:13:06.133
"So this is gonna be a joint PMF,
cuz it's a joint distribution.",00:13:08.707,00:13:11.889
"So we want the probability that x1 = n1,",00:13:14.284,00:13:19.434
"blah, blah, blah xk = nk., right?",00:13:19.434,00:13:24.167
"That's a joint PMF, we just need to say
what's the probability that there are n1",00:13:24.167,00:13:28.339
"objects in the first category and
to in the second category and so on?",00:13:28.339,00:13:32.460
"And we can immediately write
down the answer just by thinking",00:13:32.460,00:13:37.183
back to how do we derive the binomial PMF.,00:13:37.183,00:13:40.434
"All we have to do is imagine
any particular sequence,",00:13:40.434,00:13:45.416
"it's gonna be P1 to the n1, P2 to the n2,
blah, blah, blah, Pk to the nk.",00:13:45.416,00:13:52.850
"Just to have a little
intuitive example in mind,",00:13:55.110,00:13:58.091
"let's just suppose this is very
similar to how we did the binomial.",00:13:58.091,00:14:02.248
"But just to quickly review and
generalize that.",00:14:02.248,00:14:04.084
"Suppose we just have three categories,",00:14:04.084,00:14:06.147
"just to have a little
mental picture in mind.",00:14:06.147,00:14:08.461
"We had three categories,
lnd let's just say our sequence, and",00:14:08.461,00:14:11.458
"let's just write one, two, three.",00:14:11.458,00:14:13.245
Where one means category one and so on.,00:14:13.245,00:14:15.578
"So we might have a sequence like 23311112,
for example, okay?",00:14:15.578,00:14:24.406
"So let's put a couple more 2s, there
are four 2s two 3s four 1s for example.",00:14:24.406,00:14:30.694
"This says that the first
object is category 2, right?",00:14:30.694,00:14:32.960
"We're just categorising
the objects one by one.",00:14:32.960,00:14:36.200
"So any particular sequence like this,",00:14:36.200,00:14:39.377
"the probability would be P1 is
the probability of category one.",00:14:39.377,00:14:44.682
"Multiple to the power of how
many ones there are, right?",00:14:44.682,00:14:48.711
I need to put another one there.,00:14:48.711,00:14:51.313
"P2 to the power of the number of twos and
so on.",00:14:51.313,00:14:52.983
"That will be the probability
of any specific",00:14:52.983,00:14:56.035
"sequence that has the desired counts,
right?",00:14:56.035,00:14:59.341
"But then we can permute
this however we want,",00:14:59.341,00:15:01.393
"then it's just going back
to those counting problems.",00:15:01.393,00:15:03.935
"How many ways are there to permute
the letters in the word pepper, or",00:15:03.935,00:15:07.198
"the letters in the word Mississippi or
something like that.",00:15:07.198,00:15:10.133
"Where you start with n factorial, but",00:15:10.133,00:15:12.844
"that overcounts because the twos
could have been in any order.",00:15:12.844,00:15:17.347
"The threes could have been in any order,",00:15:17.347,00:15:18.581
"the ones could have been in any order,
and so on.",00:15:18.581,00:15:20.078
"So you have to adjust for
that overcounting.",00:15:20.078,00:15:22.267
"Exactly like we did for the binomial,
so we just divide by n1 factorial,",00:15:22.267,00:15:27.459
"n2 factorial, blah, blah,
blah n k factorial to account for",00:15:27.459,00:15:31.897
"all the ways you could permute the 3s,
permute the 1s, permute the 2s.",00:15:31.897,00:15:37.213
"Of course, there's a constraint here,",00:15:37.213,00:15:40.685
"this is if n1 plus blah,
blah, blah plus nk = n.",00:15:40.685,00:15:44.860
"Otherwise, it doesn't make sense, right?",00:15:46.010,00:15:47.560
Cuz we have n objects.,00:15:47.560,00:15:48.863
"We're assuming that every object
is in exactly one category.",00:15:48.863,00:15:52.467
"So it wouldn't make sense if
we added up these counts and",00:15:52.467,00:15:55.710
"they had too many or
too few, makes no sense.",00:15:55.710,00:15:58.338
"So it's 0, otherwise.",00:15:58.338,00:16:00.132
"That is if the sum of
these ns is not this n,",00:16:00.132,00:16:05.450
"then it's impossible, so it's 0.",00:16:05.450,00:16:08.520
So that didn't require a calculation.,00:16:11.472,00:16:12.910
"It just required thinking
about an example like that and",00:16:12.910,00:16:16.040
"just so
different ways to promote things, right.",00:16:16.040,00:16:18.499
So that's the joint PMF.,00:16:19.820,00:16:22.020
"It looks a lot like the binomial,
all right.",00:16:23.750,00:16:25.570
"So it's a generalization of the binomial
when you have more than two categories.",00:16:26.930,00:16:31.000
"So we'll come back to some other
properties of the multinomial later, but",00:16:32.420,00:16:36.440
"just to do a couple quick
properties to think about.",00:16:36.440,00:16:40.380
"We could ask about the marginal
distribution, conditional distribution,",00:16:40.380,00:16:44.002
things like that.,00:16:44.002,00:16:44.901
"So let's think about
the marginal distribution first.",00:16:48.990,00:16:52.769
Okay so we're letting X be multinomial.,00:16:56.250,00:17:00.189
"N, p.",00:17:03.153,00:17:04.132
"Sometimes I'll subscript a k,
just to indicate what the dimension is, so",00:17:04.132,00:17:08.653
the number of categories.,00:17:08.653,00:17:10.320
"And suppose we want the marginal,
find the marginal distribution",00:17:12.260,00:17:17.830
"of just one of these component,
let's say Xj.",00:17:19.400,00:17:22.850
"So Xj is just how many people or
how many objects are in category j.",00:17:24.350,00:17:29.250
We want its marginal distribution.,00:17:29.250,00:17:32.008
What do you think that is?,00:17:32.008,00:17:34.181
"Yeah, binomial, why did you say binomial?",00:17:41.287,00:17:45.820
"Exactly, it's either nk or it isn't nk.",00:17:45.820,00:17:48.926
"So I mean if you said if
you look at your notes,",00:17:48.926,00:17:51.515
"how do you get from joint distribution
to marginal distribution?",00:17:51.515,00:17:54.991
I would say if you take this thing and,00:17:54.991,00:17:57.991
"do k- 1 sigma sign sum over all
possible things, do a lot of algebra.",00:17:57.991,00:18:04.380
"But that's not thinking about it, right?",00:18:04.380,00:18:07.410
"To marginalize we'd sum up the joint or
we integrate in the continuous case.",00:18:07.410,00:18:11.270
"We sum in the discrete case,
sum of everything we don't want, okay?",00:18:11.270,00:18:15.490
"But instead let's just think about
the story, think about what it means.",00:18:15.490,00:18:19.520
"As you just said, each of these objects,
either it's in category j or it isn't.",00:18:19.520,00:18:26.340
"We're assuming they're
all independent trials.",00:18:26.340,00:18:29.310
"So if we define success to
mean being in category j,",00:18:29.310,00:18:33.720
"the probability of success
is pj in our object.",00:18:33.720,00:18:38.800
So that's just immediate.,00:18:38.800,00:18:40.210
"I didn't write justification for this but
that just proved itself from the story",00:18:40.210,00:18:45.300
"you know it's a complete truth
just to say because the binomial,",00:18:45.300,00:18:48.516
it's independent Bernoulli trial.,00:18:48.516,00:18:51.160
"That's the probability of success, okay?",00:18:51.160,00:18:54.732
"So we can get that immediately and in
particular that also gives us the mean and",00:18:54.732,00:19:00.064
"the variance without having to
do a calculation, E(Xj) = npj.",00:19:00.064,00:19:04.670
"And the expected value of the variance
because we derived the variance",00:19:04.670,00:19:09.785
"of the binomial before we
don't need to re-derive that.",00:19:09.785,00:19:14.044
"We already know the variance of a binomial
is np(1- p) so this npj (1- pj),",00:19:14.044,00:19:19.614
"no additional work needed
because we know it's binomial.",00:19:19.614,00:19:24.480
"Okay, so that's just immediate from
thinking about what this means.",00:19:24.480,00:19:27.290
So that's one property.,00:19:28.620,00:19:30.690
That's the marginals.,00:19:30.690,00:19:32.730
"And let's think about kind
of something similar.",00:19:32.730,00:19:36.680
"Let's call this, well,
I call this the lumping property.",00:19:37.770,00:19:44.485
"What happened, the question is,
we have all these categories,",00:19:48.108,00:19:52.318
"well what happens if we decide to merge
certain categories together, right?",00:19:52.318,00:19:58.130
"Okay, so just to have an example in mind,",00:19:58.130,00:20:01.610
"let's let K = 10, so
we're thinking of X as a vector.",00:20:03.370,00:20:08.330
"X1 through X10 and
just to have a concrete example in mind.",00:20:08.330,00:20:15.030
"So this is multinomial, let's say this
is multinomial, and, P1 through P10.",00:20:15.030,00:20:23.364
"And to have a concrete example in mind,",00:20:23.364,00:20:25.665
"well let's imagine we're in a country
that has ten political parties.",00:20:25.665,00:20:30.280
"Okay, and you take n people and
assume that the people",00:20:30.280,00:20:34.930
"are independent of each other, and
you wanna know how many people are in, and",00:20:34.930,00:20:38.610
"assume that everyone in this country is
a member of one of these ten parties.",00:20:38.610,00:20:43.140
"Okay, and then you take all
these people and you say, okay.",00:20:43.140,00:20:48.040
Ask each person which party they're in.,00:20:48.040,00:20:50.310
"X1 is the number of people in
the first political party,",00:20:51.890,00:20:54.310
"X2 is the number in the second one,
and so on, right?",00:20:54.310,00:20:58.350
So that that would be multinomial if,00:20:58.350,00:21:00.900
"these are the probabilities of the
different party memberships, all right?",00:21:00.900,00:21:04.960
"So now, what I call the lumping property
is what if it's a country where it's,",00:21:04.960,00:21:12.680
"there are only two dominant parties, and
all the other parties are much smaller?",00:21:12.680,00:21:17.190
"And so it might be kind of unwieldy to
deal with this ten dimensional vector.",00:21:17.190,00:21:20.235
"Maybe we wanna compress
all the third party,",00:21:20.235,00:21:22.592
"so suppose that the first two are kind
of the two dominant major parties and",00:21:22.592,00:21:26.437
"the rest of them are kind of minor, so
we may wanna just lump them together.",00:21:26.437,00:21:30.362
"So that's why I call it
the lumping property,",00:21:30.362,00:21:32.129
lump all the other parties together.,00:21:32.129,00:21:34.260
"So what if we considered,
let's see, let Y = X1,",00:21:34.260,00:21:40.792
"X2, and
then group all these ones together.",00:21:40.792,00:21:46.660
"So I'll just add them up,
X3 plus blah, blah, blah,",00:21:46.660,00:21:50.170
"plus X10, right.",00:21:50.170,00:21:56.290
"So this would be like party one,
party two, and",00:21:56.290,00:21:59.650
then other third party grouped together.,00:21:59.650,00:22:02.676
"Without doing any calculation or
algebra whatsoever,",00:22:02.676,00:22:05.611
"we can immediately write
down the distribution of Y.",00:22:05.611,00:22:08.430
Y is just gonna be multinomial.,00:22:08.430,00:22:11.385
Same n.,00:22:15.232,00:22:16.535
"And then all we've done is group
these categories together,",00:22:16.535,00:22:21.533
"but then it's the same problem again,",00:22:21.533,00:22:24.704
"it's just it has a larger probability
just lump together all those Ps.",00:22:24.704,00:22:30.485
"Okay, so this should be
obvious from the story, right.",00:22:33.841,00:22:36.908
It's the same problem again.,00:22:36.908,00:22:39.220
"So just like we emphasized with
the binomial we can define success and",00:22:39.220,00:22:42.571
failure however we want.,00:22:42.571,00:22:43.856
"Here we can rearrange the categories and
whatever, the only thing we",00:22:43.856,00:22:48.406
"need to make sure of is that each
object is in exactly one category.",00:22:48.406,00:22:53.740
"So it would not work if you could
be in more than one category or",00:22:53.740,00:22:57.330
be in no categories.,00:22:57.330,00:22:58.100
"But if you define your
categories such that",00:22:58.100,00:23:00.920
"it's true that each object isn't
exactly one, then you get multinomial.",00:23:00.920,00:23:06.400
"Didn't need to do any algebra or
calculus to show that.",00:23:06.400,00:23:09.020
So that's pretty nice.,00:23:09.020,00:23:10.050
"Similarly, let's get
the conditional distribution.",00:23:11.110,00:23:14.825
"So what if we wanted, so
again x is multinomial.",00:23:18.297,00:23:21.730
"What if we want a conditional distribution
where we got to learn what X1 is and",00:23:23.680,00:23:29.159
"we want the conditional distribution
of the rest given that we now know X1.",00:23:29.159,00:23:34.570
"So we want a conditional,",00:23:37.351,00:23:39.193
"you might call it a conditional
joint PMF because you're given X1.",00:23:39.193,00:23:44.070
"Let's say that we're given that X1 = n1,
okay?",00:23:45.910,00:23:50.000
"And then we want the conditional joint
distribution of everything else.",00:23:50.000,00:23:54.610
"So we know exactly how many
people are in the first category.",00:23:54.610,00:23:58.330
But we don't know about the rest of them.,00:23:58.330,00:23:59.820
"Well, given that X1 = n1,",00:24:01.862,00:24:06.139
"we want the joint PMF of
the rest X2 through Xk.",00:24:06.139,00:24:12.991
"Still gonna be multinomial, but",00:24:18.304,00:24:19.980
"we have to be a little bit careful
with getting the parameters right.",00:24:19.980,00:24:23.010
"So now this is gonna be k- 1 dimensional,",00:24:26.170,00:24:29.537
"cuz we know how many people
are in the first category, but",00:24:29.537,00:24:34.024
"we're looking at the remaining
k- 1 categories.",00:24:34.024,00:24:38.159
"And the number of people, well,",00:24:38.159,00:24:41.302
"n- n1 have been allocated
into the first party, okay?",00:24:41.302,00:24:47.090
So we have n- n1 people left.,00:24:47.090,00:24:50.390
"And then we just have to get
the probability vector, right?",00:24:50.390,00:24:56.670
"Now if we just wrote p2 through pk,
that would be a common mistake, but",00:24:58.710,00:25:03.700
"it should be easy to see that that's
a mistake because those don't add up to 1.",00:25:03.700,00:25:06.750
"So it can't just be p2 through pk, right?",00:25:07.910,00:25:11.530
"I'm imagining that I've taken, and
it doesn't matter which people.",00:25:12.880,00:25:16.630
"I can imagine,
I'm conditioning on the count.",00:25:16.630,00:25:18.590
"But then I could further condition on
which specific people are in category one,",00:25:18.590,00:25:23.554
and then use symmetry.,00:25:23.554,00:25:25.310
"So I guess, so I may as well just assume
that the first n1 people are in category",00:25:25.310,00:25:31.070
"one, okay, but to get these ps, well, then
we have to think conditionally, right?",00:25:31.070,00:25:37.700
"So let's call this vector,",00:25:37.700,00:25:40.716
"let's call it p2 prime through
pk prime where somehow",00:25:40.716,00:25:46.496
"we have to figure out what's p2 prime and
so on.",00:25:46.496,00:25:51.660
"Because without the primes it doesn't
add up to one makes no sense.",00:25:51.660,00:25:56.120
So let's find p2 prime for example.,00:25:56.120,00:25:58.340
"Intuitively, I want this to
be proportional to P2, right?",00:26:04.020,00:26:09.000
"Cuz I know how many people
are in the first party, but",00:26:09.000,00:26:12.020
"that shouldn't kind of affect the relative
distribution of the rest of the party.",00:26:12.020,00:26:16.840
So basically you just have to renormalize.,00:26:16.840,00:26:19.700
"If I want to write that out,",00:26:19.700,00:26:20.910
"mathematically I would say P2
equals the probability of being in",00:26:20.910,00:26:25.370
"category 2, given",00:26:27.270,00:26:30.310
"a random object being in category 2 given,
that it's not in category 1.",00:26:33.850,00:26:38.409
"Because we've already thrown out
the ones that are in category 1.",00:26:40.900,00:26:44.830
"So just by the definition of conditional
probability, being in category 2 I",00:26:44.830,00:26:49.594
"take the intersection of this and this,
but once you say you're in category 2,",00:26:49.594,00:26:54.577
"you know you're not in category 1,
so that's redundant.",00:26:54.577,00:26:58.340
So the numerator is just P2.,00:26:58.340,00:27:00.580
"And the denominator is 1- P1,",00:27:00.580,00:27:04.865
"that is just the probability
of not being in category 1.",00:27:04.865,00:27:12.215
"Or we could also write it as P2
over P2 + blah, blah, blah + Pk.",00:27:12.215,00:27:17.000
"So all this says is we've taken these and
you know similarly for",00:27:17.000,00:27:21.717
"the other ones Pj prime equals Pj
over P2 + blah, blah, blah + Pk.",00:27:21.717,00:27:26.880
"All this says is that we've renormalized
this, it's still multinomial.",00:27:26.880,00:27:32.230
"Okay, so multinomials have really
nice properties like this and you can",00:27:32.230,00:27:35.785
"see these things just by thinking about
what it means without doing a calculation.",00:27:35.785,00:27:39.873
"So that's a very useful distribution for
lots of applications.",00:27:39.873,00:27:47.100
"Okay, so we'll say more about
the multinomial in the next lecture or",00:27:49.980,00:27:55.750
the lecture after.,00:27:55.750,00:27:57.290
"But I wanna do one more
continuous example as well,",00:27:57.290,00:28:02.490
"an example where we actually
do need to do a calculation.",00:28:02.490,00:28:06.910
And this is another kind of famous one.,00:28:09.030,00:28:12.420
"Good example of how do
we work with joint PDFs,",00:28:16.260,00:28:21.603
"which I think we need more practice with
or at least you need more practice with,",00:28:21.603,00:28:25.630
"then I'll try to help with that,
so this is a good example.",00:28:25.630,00:28:28.280
I call this the Cauchy Interview Problem.,00:28:30.400,00:28:33.350
"I call the Cauchy Interview Problem
not because Cauchy ask",00:28:37.170,00:28:41.095
"this as an interview problem, but",00:28:41.095,00:28:43.417
"because it sounds more interesting to
call it that than the Cauchy Problem.",00:28:43.417,00:28:48.560
"But actually for some reason,",00:28:48.560,00:28:50.838
"this doesn't seem like it should
be a common interview problem, but",00:28:50.838,00:28:55.919
"I've actually seen this on several
occasions asked as an interview problem",00:28:55.919,00:29:01.527
"just I think to test whether you can do
work with joint PDFs and things like that.",00:29:01.527,00:29:07.470
"So okay, it is an interview problem,",00:29:07.470,00:29:10.085
"though it sort of
shouldn't be in some sense.",00:29:10.085,00:29:13.289
"Anyway, I have to tell you what
the Cauchy, I mean Cauchy was a famous",00:29:13.289,00:29:16.911
"mathematician, but in this context, Cauchy
is referring to a specific distribution.",00:29:16.911,00:29:21.610
The Cauchy distribution.,00:29:24.007,00:29:25.730
"It's a famous distribution
that has a lot of",00:29:30.860,00:29:35.754
"kind of weird, scary properties.",00:29:35.754,00:29:40.020
"I just got some of these distribution
plushies that I found online.",00:29:40.020,00:29:43.943
"I might bring them, but they're
a little bit small to show you here.",00:29:43.943,00:29:47.650
"But if you come to my office hours,
you can see them in my office.",00:29:47.650,00:29:52.570
"But little pillows illustrating different
distributions, I have them in my office.",00:29:52.570,00:29:58.620
The Cauchy is called the evil Cauchy and,00:29:58.620,00:30:03.558
it looks pretty evil.,00:30:03.558,00:30:06.404
"And so let me first tell you
what the distribution is, and",00:30:06.404,00:30:09.270
"then tell you a little
bit about why is it evil.",00:30:09.270,00:30:11.940
"And then we'll try to find its PDF,
which as I said,",00:30:11.940,00:30:14.660
"has been a common interview problem,
find the PDF of a Cauchy.",00:30:14.660,00:30:18.190
"That's the problem, okay?",00:30:18.190,00:30:19.830
"So the Cauchy is
the distribution of let's say,",00:30:19.830,00:30:24.760
X over Y with x and y iid standard normal.,00:30:24.760,00:30:31.850
"So it's a simple definition,",00:30:31.850,00:30:34.900
"just take a ratio of two iid standard
normals and we call that a Cauchy.",00:30:34.900,00:30:40.110
"And you can see why that could
be a useful distribution for",00:30:40.110,00:30:42.620
"a lot of different applications where
ratios is a pretty natural thing.",00:30:42.620,00:30:48.440
"So that's a Cauchy, and
the problem is find the PDF.",00:30:48.440,00:30:51.450
"Of this random variable, okay?",00:30:55.760,00:30:58.940
Let's call this thing T.,00:30:58.940,00:31:00.368
Find PDF of T.,00:31:03.470,00:31:04.990
"So we're defining T to be
the ratio of iid standard normals.",00:31:04.990,00:31:08.091
We want to find its PDF.,00:31:08.091,00:31:09.219
"All right, so that doesn't yet
answer why this is evil.",00:31:09.219,00:31:13.430
"Well, some properties of the Cauchy
that we're not gonna prove right now,",00:31:13.430,00:31:18.397
"but just to kind of foreshadow
why is this thing so evil.",00:31:18.397,00:31:22.059
"First of all,
it does not have an expected value.",00:31:22.059,00:31:24.160
"If you try to compute e,
expected value, it'll blow up.",00:31:24.160,00:31:28.630
"No, no, no, that's not that evil.",00:31:28.630,00:31:30.269
"There are a lot of distributions where if
you try to compute the expected value,",00:31:30.269,00:31:34.523
it blows up.,00:31:34.523,00:31:35.230
"So it does not have a mean,
it doesn't have a variance.",00:31:35.230,00:31:38.345
"The thing that's really evil about the
Cauchy is that If you take iid cauchys,",00:31:38.345,00:31:43.411
"so let's say don't just have T,
we have T1 through TN.",00:31:43.411,00:31:47.120
They're just iid ratios of normals.,00:31:47.120,00:31:51.500
"When we get to the law of large numbers
later in the course, we'll see that when",00:31:53.300,00:31:58.420
"we average a bunch of iid random
variables, we What happens",00:31:58.420,00:32:03.695
"if we average a lot of them is that
should be close to their mean, right?",00:32:03.695,00:32:08.797
"You average a lot of IID things
that should be close to the mean.",00:32:08.797,00:32:13.782
In this case there is no mean.,00:32:13.782,00:32:15.468
"But the weird fact is that if you
average all these Cauchy, IID Cauchy",00:32:15.468,00:32:19.412
"the distribution of that average is still
a Cauchy, doesn't change the distribution.",00:32:19.412,00:32:24.810
"You can average a million IID
cosye it's still gonna be Cauchy.",00:32:24.810,00:32:29.510
"So in some sence you that's kind of you're
hoping soil as you collect more and",00:32:29.510,00:32:35.260
"more data you're hoping to converge
to the truth in some sense.",00:32:35.260,00:32:38.610
"In this case if all you do
is average then you just",00:32:38.610,00:32:41.740
"not getting anywhere
the distribution doesn't change.",00:32:41.740,00:32:44.560
"There are other ways to work with,",00:32:44.560,00:32:45.780
"if you had Cauchy data there
are other ways to work with it.",00:32:45.780,00:32:48.660
"It would be a bad idea to just take
the naively average everything,",00:32:48.660,00:32:52.060
there are other things you could do.,00:32:52.060,00:32:54.720
"Okay, so
any way that's the Cauchy Distribution.",00:32:54.720,00:32:57.200
"Now let's find the PDF, just for
practice with our joint distributions.",00:32:57.200,00:33:02.410
"And there are several
ways we could do this.",00:33:02.410,00:33:04.569
"One way would be to use
the law of total probability,",00:33:05.610,00:33:10.640
and condition on y to make things easier.,00:33:10.640,00:33:13.520
And that's a perfectly good way to do it.,00:33:13.520,00:33:15.840
"But I think I wanna just start by
practicing just more directly how to just",00:33:15.840,00:33:19.700
directly get the CDF.,00:33:20.710,00:33:22.660
"Let's find the CDF, and
take the derivative and get the PDF.",00:33:22.660,00:33:26.780
"So with the CDF we could use
the law of total probability, but",00:33:26.780,00:33:31.170
let's just directly write down.,00:33:31.170,00:33:32.860
"It's going to be a double
integral because we have an X and",00:33:32.860,00:33:35.930
"a Y and let's just write down that double
integral and see if we can do it, okay?",00:33:35.930,00:33:40.910
So let's find the CDF.,00:33:40.910,00:33:43.800
"So the probability that
x over y is less than or",00:33:43.800,00:33:47.900
"equal to some number, t,
that's what we need for the CDF.",00:33:47.900,00:33:51.720
"This is practice with, this is an event,",00:33:51.720,00:33:56.070
"it's an event that the ratio
is less than or equal to t.",00:33:57.300,00:33:59.370
"We want to find some probability of
an event where it's based on x and",00:33:59.370,00:34:04.240
"y, so unless we can think
of some clever trick for",00:34:04.240,00:34:07.230
"simplifying this we basically
have to do a double integral.",00:34:07.230,00:34:10.430
"Or else, we can use the law of total
probability and do a single integral,",00:34:10.430,00:34:14.470
"but I actually don't think
that's any easier here.",00:34:14.470,00:34:19.300
"So my first impulse would be to
multiply both sides by y here.",00:34:19.300,00:34:22.030
"But you have to be careful in doing
that because y could be negative,",00:34:22.030,00:34:27.168
"so we can simplify this
a little bit by using symmetry",00:34:27.168,00:34:31.135
"first, And putting absolute values.",00:34:31.135,00:34:35.870
"This follows from the symmetry
of of the normal.",00:34:35.870,00:34:39.532
"And you can think through for yourself
exactly how I'm using symmetry here, but",00:34:44.041,00:34:48.961
the basic idea is with the normal.,00:34:48.961,00:34:51.070
"If I have a standard normal and multiply
it by minus 1 it's still standard normal,",00:34:51.070,00:34:56.060
"if I multiply it, if I randomly chose say
with probably one half multiply it by",00:34:56.060,00:35:00.560
"minus 1, probably one half do
nothing It's still standard normal.",00:35:00.560,00:35:04.360
"Have the same symmetry in the denominator,
so sort of have two symmetric things.",00:35:05.370,00:35:09.160
"And we might as well just kind
of absorb the plusses and",00:35:09.160,00:35:12.370
"minuses and write it this way,
follows from symmetry.",00:35:12.370,00:35:16.110
"The reason I wanted to do that is just so
that I could write this as x less than or",00:35:16.110,00:35:19.890
"equal to t absolute y, without",00:35:19.890,00:35:24.230
"having to flip the inequality or worrying
about whether the inequality flips.",00:35:24.230,00:35:28.320
"Now let's just write this down
as a double integral, okay?",00:35:28.320,00:35:35.150
We are saying that x so,00:35:35.150,00:35:38.383
"we can either dxdy or dydx, but",00:35:38.383,00:35:43.054
let's suppose that we are doing dx dy.,00:35:43.054,00:35:48.996
"And to get a probability well what we do,",00:35:48.996,00:35:54.494
we integrate the joint PDF over,00:35:54.494,00:35:58.700
"whatever region we want, okay?",00:35:58.700,00:36:03.245
So Y goes from minus infinity to infinity.,00:36:03.245,00:36:07.750
"And, the main thing again to be careful
about, is the limits of integration.",00:36:09.040,00:36:12.330
"X, the inner limits can depend on Y,",00:36:12.330,00:36:18.700
"and X, we're looking at the region
that goes up to t absolute y.",00:36:18.700,00:36:23.770
"So x goes from minus infinity
to t absolute y, and",00:36:23.770,00:36:29.450
"then what we're integrating
is just the joint PDF, right?",00:36:29.450,00:36:35.760
"So the joint PDF is 1 over root 2 pie,
e to the minus x squared over 2.",00:36:35.760,00:36:42.370
"And then same thing for the y,
1 over root 2 pi e to the minus y square,",00:36:42.370,00:36:48.800
because they're IID standard normal.,00:36:48.800,00:36:53.170
"So the other term, e to the minus y
squared over 2, doesn't depend on x.",00:36:53.170,00:36:58.110
"So I could write it here but
I could immediately then pull it out here.",00:36:58.110,00:37:01.520
"So I may as well write it here so
that it's not interfering with this part.",00:37:01.520,00:37:05.160
Sets e to the minus y square over two and,00:37:05.160,00:37:07.440
"there is another 1/2 pi
this just stick over there.",00:37:07.440,00:37:10.660
"So all I did is write
down the normal PDF for",00:37:10.660,00:37:14.970
"x and the normal PDF for y and
I took the y part cuz that depends on x.",00:37:14.970,00:37:20.030
"That looks pretty ugly so
let's see if we can do it, well,",00:37:20.030,00:37:24.832
"one thing that we could simplify is just
recognizing what do we actually have here.",00:37:24.832,00:37:31.695
"So we have this integral,
minus infinity to infinity,",00:37:31.695,00:37:34.683
"e to the minus y squared over 2, and
then we have this inner integral.",00:37:34.683,00:37:38.447
"Okay?
Now in one sense we can't do",00:37:40.859,00:37:43.600
this integral.,00:37:43.600,00:37:44.230
"Because that's the normal PDF and you can
prove that you can't do that integral.",00:37:45.995,00:37:52.090
"And in another sense,
not only can you do that integral,",00:37:52.090,00:37:54.850
"you already know what
that integral is right?",00:37:54.850,00:37:56.606
"That's just capital phi evaluated here,
that's just the normal CDF.",00:37:56.606,00:38:01.839
"So actually it's just phi,
so depending on whether you",00:38:01.839,00:38:06.842
"consider that doing the integral or
not, it's just that, dy.",00:38:06.842,00:38:12.597
"That's just the definition of
the standard, normal CDF, okay?",00:38:12.597,00:38:16.910
"Now these absolute value signs
are a little bit annoying.",00:38:18.970,00:38:22.610
"So, let's notice that we
have an even function,",00:38:22.610,00:38:27.640
"because y squared, absolute value y,
this is an even function.",00:38:27.640,00:38:30.980
"So we may as well go from 0 to
infinity instead, and multiply by 2.",00:38:30.980,00:38:33.860
"So then we'd have a square
root of 2 over pi.",00:38:33.860,00:38:38.428
"I just multiplied by 2, and",00:38:38.428,00:38:41.794
"then we're going from 0 to infinity,",00:38:41.794,00:38:46.423
"e to the -y squared over
two capital phi of ty dy.",00:38:46.423,00:38:52.189
"All right, and then you know, the clock
is ticking on our job interview and",00:38:58.489,00:39:04.793
"we've get here and
it's sort of possibly start to panic.",00:39:04.793,00:39:09.713
"And that capital phi is
an intractable integral,",00:39:09.713,00:39:14.060
"that's why we call it capital phi,
it's cuz we couldn't do it.",00:39:14.060,00:39:20.260
"Now, you are being asked in
your interview to integrate",00:39:20.260,00:39:25.031
"an integral that you couldn't do,",00:39:25.031,00:39:28.077
"sounds pretty bad, However.",00:39:28.077,00:39:34.098
"One thing that might help,
is that on the interview,",00:39:35.806,00:39:39.787
"we were asked to find the PDF,
not to find the CDF, that's the CDF.",00:39:39.787,00:39:45.700
"And we know that the PDF is
the derivative of the CDF, so",00:39:45.700,00:39:48.810
"the PDF is the derivative of the integral
of an integral that we can't do.",00:39:48.810,00:39:53.120
So somehow maybe that will save us.,00:39:53.120,00:39:55.940
So let's take the derivative.,00:39:55.940,00:39:57.539
"So here's the PDF,
PDF is the derivative of the CDF.",00:40:00.198,00:40:08.120
"This thing is capital F(t),
if we call the CDF capital F.",00:40:08.120,00:40:12.900
"The PDF is the derivative, F'(t).",00:40:12.900,00:40:19.193
"So we're taking the derivative
with respect to t,",00:40:19.193,00:40:21.585
"not with respect to y
which would make no sense.",00:40:21.585,00:40:24.410
"Notice that this y is a dummy variable,
okay?",00:40:24.410,00:40:26.950
"This is a function of t we're taking
the derivative with respect to t.",00:40:26.950,00:40:32.282
"Okay, now there's a theorem
in calculus that says,",00:40:32.282,00:40:35.097
"under some pretty mild conditions, if you
have a reasonably well-behaved thing that",00:40:35.097,00:40:39.666
"you're integrating, you can exchange
the derivative and the interval.",00:40:39.666,00:40:44.120
"This is a very,
very well behaved function.",00:40:44.120,00:40:46.861
"Capital Phi is just a continuous
differentiable thing between 0 and 1.",00:40:46.861,00:40:52.898
"Either the -y squared over 2,
that's infinitely differentiable.",00:40:52.898,00:40:56.617
"It decays to 0 very fast, so
this is a very, very nice function.",00:40:56.617,00:41:00.746
"So there's gonna be no technical problem
whatsoever with swapping the derivative",00:41:00.746,00:41:04.076
and the integral.,00:41:04.076,00:41:04.843
"We're gonna take the derivative
of this with respect to t,",00:41:04.843,00:41:10.171
and then we're gonna try to simplify it.,00:41:10.171,00:41:13.910
"So we take the derivative,
bring the derivative inside, okay?",00:41:13.910,00:41:17.580
"So we have the integral 0 to infinity,
e to the -y squared over 2.",00:41:17.580,00:41:24.750
"We're differentiating with respect to t,
we're bringing in a d with respect to dt.",00:41:25.980,00:41:31.635
"So we're treating either the -y square
derivitive which behaves as a constant",00:41:31.635,00:41:34.985
"when we're differentiating
with respect to t.",00:41:34.985,00:41:37.050
"Then we take the derivative of
capital Phi of ty, by the chain rule,",00:41:37.050,00:41:41.858
"y is gonna come out, because we
are differentiating with respect to t.",00:41:41.858,00:41:45.460
"So y is going to come out
from the chain rule, y.",00:41:45.460,00:41:48.470
"And then we just need
the derivative of this, but",00:41:48.470,00:41:53.246
"the derivative of
the standard normal CDF is",00:41:53.246,00:41:57.557
"the standard normal PDF,
which is 1 over root 2pi,",00:41:57.557,00:42:02.800
"e to the -z squared over 2
in general where z is ty.",00:42:02.800,00:42:07.833
"So it's e to the -t squared,
y squared over 2.",00:42:07.833,00:42:13.673
I just squared this thing divided by 2dy.,00:42:13.673,00:42:16.885
Now let's see if we can do it.,00:42:19.290,00:42:20.540
"So the square root of 2 here
cancels this square root of 2.",00:42:23.745,00:42:27.490
"We have square root of pi, square root
of pi, so we're gonna get 1 over pi.",00:42:27.490,00:42:31.092
And then we just need to integrate,00:42:32.995,00:42:38.104
from 0 to infinity of ye to the -t,00:42:38.104,00:42:43.213
squared y squared over 2dy.,00:42:43.213,00:42:47.780
Now this looks like an integral we can do.,00:42:54.387,00:42:56.475
"&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; The other what?",00:42:56.475,00:42:59.112
"&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Say that again.",00:42:59.112,00:43:08.057
"&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; There's another e to the -y squared",00:43:08.057,00:43:12.107
over 2.,00:43:12.107,00:43:13.020
"Yeah, I forgot that one, thank you.",00:43:13.020,00:43:14.400
"There's another,
we'll just combine that one with this one.",00:43:15.630,00:43:18.640
So that would be 1.,00:43:18.640,00:43:20.102
"Uh-oh, I guess don't get hired,
that's sad.",00:43:20.102,00:43:23.950
"There's another,
e to the -y squared over 2 that I forgot.",00:43:23.950,00:43:26.820
"But now, I thank you, I put it back, okay?",00:43:26.820,00:43:31.110
"I haven't interviewed for
any jobs since I came here five years ago,",00:43:31.110,00:43:35.170
so I'm kinda rusty.,00:43:35.170,00:43:36.970
"So I put back either the -y squared
over 2 that you helped me with,",00:43:36.970,00:43:42.271
"and now that should be okay, right?",00:43:42.271,00:43:45.220
"Now, this is an integral we can do,",00:43:45.220,00:43:47.400
"because we know that the derivative
of y squared is gonna be 2y, and",00:43:47.400,00:43:51.546
"that's gonna be taken care of there,
now it's an easy u substitution again.",00:43:51.546,00:43:56.860
So we can just let u = let's say 1,00:43:56.860,00:44:02.096
+ t squared y squared over 2.,00:44:02.096,00:44:06.959
"Just make that substitution, so
then this just becomes e to the -u, okay?",00:44:06.959,00:44:12.943
"So du = 1 + t squared times,",00:44:12.943,00:44:19.032
now we're treating t as constant again.,00:44:19.032,00:44:27.566
"We're changing the variable y,
transforming it to u.",00:44:27.566,00:44:33.189
"So the derivative y squared over 2 is y,
so we have y times 1 + t squared dy.",00:44:33.189,00:44:39.737
"So we have the Ydy, we're just
missing the 1 + t squared, okay?",00:44:39.737,00:44:46.120
"So I'll just multiply and
divide by 1 + t squared.",00:44:46.120,00:44:48.930
"Then we're just integrating e to the -u
du, which is a very, very easy integral.",00:44:48.930,00:44:53.390
"We know that that's 1,
either just by doing it or",00:44:53.390,00:44:55.470
"because it's the integral of
the exponential PDF again.",00:44:55.470,00:44:59.580
"Okay, so then we immediately now have the
answer, 1 over pi 1 + t squared for all t.",00:44:59.580,00:45:06.984
So that's the PDF.,00:45:12.719,00:45:14.170
"If we wanted the CDF,
all we would have to do is integrate this,",00:45:16.240,00:45:21.490
then it's gonna do some arc tangent thing.,00:45:21.490,00:45:23.440
"All right, so that's the Cauchy.",00:45:24.530,00:45:27.520
"And let me just quickly just show you
how you would start the other method,",00:45:27.520,00:45:33.224
which would be the probability.,00:45:33.224,00:45:36.450
"I'm not gonna do the whole thing,
because at some point,",00:45:36.450,00:45:39.645
"that's just gonna reduce
back to this method.",00:45:39.645,00:45:42.630
"But just to show you
what it would look like.",00:45:42.630,00:45:44.400
"Just as a quick alternative without
going through the whole thing,",00:45:50.322,00:45:52.887
cuz it's gonna be similar.,00:45:52.887,00:45:53.970
But it's useful to have both methods.,00:45:53.970,00:45:55.246
"So this would be the method using the
double integral, okay, and that's the PDF.",00:45:55.246,00:46:01.360
"Which by the way,
we should check thati that's a valid PDF.",00:46:01.360,00:46:03.647
Does it integrate to 1?,00:46:03.647,00:46:05.410
"Well, if you integrate that thing,
you'll get an arctangent thing.",00:46:05.410,00:46:09.123
"And you can check that when you
evaluate the arctangent thing,",00:46:09.123,00:46:12.230
"you will get 1, okay?",00:46:12.230,00:46:13.410
"So just quickly, the alternative
using the law of total probability.",00:46:14.690,00:46:19.460
"x less than or
equal to t absolute value of y.",00:46:19.460,00:46:22.867
"You kind of just think to yourself,
what do we wish that we knew here?",00:46:24.930,00:46:31.900
"We could decide to condition on x, or
we could decide to condition on y.",00:46:31.900,00:46:36.217
"This is gonna be the integral,
let's say we condition on y.",00:46:40.089,00:46:45.630
"The probability x less than or equal to t,",00:46:45.630,00:46:48.973
"absolute value of Y,
given, let's say, Y = y.",00:46:48.973,00:46:52.994
"This would be the law of total
probability, right, just conditioning.",00:46:52.994,00:46:57.060
"We can choose whether to condition on x or
to condition on y, but",00:46:57.060,00:46:59.642
I think I wanna condition on y.,00:46:59.642,00:47:00.925
"Okay, law of total probability,
remember the discrete case we just seen,",00:47:03.981,00:47:08.717
"sum over all cases, p of a given,
b, whatever, p of v, whatever.",00:47:08.717,00:47:13.180
We have a partition.,00:47:13.180,00:47:14.880
"And in this case,
we're integrating instead of summing, so",00:47:14.880,00:47:17.570
"we're conditioning on y and
then we're multiplying by 5y.",00:47:17.570,00:47:21.532
Lower case 5y is the standard normal PDF.,00:47:21.532,00:47:25.205
"All right, well,
let's see if this helps at all.",00:47:28.923,00:47:32.500
"This is saying to treat Y as just
being known to equal little y, okay?",00:47:36.020,00:47:42.000
So I can plug in little y there.,00:47:42.000,00:47:47.050
And then the tricky part here is that,00:47:47.050,00:47:49.620
"we need to use the fact
that x is independent of y.",00:47:49.620,00:47:52.040
"Because if x are not independent of y,
you could plug this thing in, but",00:47:52.040,00:47:56.030
"then you still have this condition, okay?",00:47:56.030,00:47:59.370
"But since they're independent,
you can plug in Y = y and",00:47:59.370,00:48:02.251
"then get rid of the condition,
because they're independent.",00:48:02.251,00:48:06.400
"So when we do that,
that's just gonna be phi.",00:48:06.400,00:48:10.168
"The probability that x is less than or
equal to t absolute value of y,",00:48:10.168,00:48:15.190
"is just phi of tf to the value of y,
just by definition, right?",00:48:15.190,00:48:20.340
"Because we're plugging in y,",00:48:20.340,00:48:21.874
"that's just a constant probability
of x less than some constant.",00:48:21.874,00:48:25.186
"It's just the standard
normal CDF evaluated there.",00:48:25.186,00:48:29.150
"Phi of (y)dy, which I think is
the same as the integral we had.",00:48:29.150,00:48:35.172
Does that look the same?,00:48:35.172,00:48:37.710
"Yeah, so over there, I just wrote out
what this is, but it's the same thing.",00:48:37.710,00:48:41.040
And then proceed in the same way.,00:48:41.040,00:48:43.170
So that would be a second way to do this.,00:48:43.170,00:48:45.940
"We'll see a third way later on,",00:48:45.940,00:48:48.880
"just because this is
a common interview question.",00:48:48.880,00:48:51.140
"So it's good to have more than three or
more than two ways to do it.",00:48:51.140,00:48:55.408
"All right, so I'll stop for now.",00:48:55.408,00:48:57.172
I'll see you Wednesday.,00:48:57.172,00:48:59.210
