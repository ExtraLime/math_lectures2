"PROFESSOR: So
again, welcome back.",00:00:21.760,00:00:24.020
"And today's topic
is a continuation",00:00:24.020,00:00:28.190
of what we did last time.,00:00:28.190,00:00:29.420
"We still have a little
bit of work and thinking",00:00:29.420,00:00:31.850
"to do concerning
polar coordinates.",00:00:31.850,00:00:38.600
"So we're going to talk
about polar coordinates.",00:00:38.600,00:00:50.210
"And my first job today is to
talk a little bit about area.",00:00:50.210,00:00:58.320
"That's something we
didn't mention last time.",00:00:58.320,00:01:01.760
"And since we're all
back from Thanksgiving,",00:01:01.760,00:01:05.320
"we can certainly talk
about it in terms of a pie.",00:01:05.320,00:01:10.130
"Which is the basic idea for
area in polar coordinates.",00:01:10.130,00:01:14.650
"Here's our pie, and
here's a slice of the pie.",00:01:14.650,00:01:21.840
"The slice has a piece of
arc length on it, which",00:01:21.840,00:01:25.700
I'm going to call delta theta.,00:01:25.700,00:01:28.150
"And the area of that
shaded-in slice,",00:01:28.150,00:01:31.540
I'm going to call delta A.,00:01:31.540,00:01:35.070
"And let's suppose
that the radius is a.",00:01:35.070,00:01:38.210
Little a.,00:01:38.210,00:01:39.350
So this is a pie of radius a.,00:01:39.350,00:01:45.950
That's our picture.,00:01:45.950,00:01:48.130
"Now, it's pretty easy
to figure out what",00:01:48.130,00:01:50.510
the area that slice of pie is.,00:01:50.510,00:01:54.390
"The total area is,
of course, pi a^2.",00:01:54.390,00:01:58.650
We know that.,00:01:58.650,00:02:00.030
"And to get this fraction,
delta A, all we have to do",00:02:00.030,00:02:05.190
"is take the percentage of the
arc of the total circumference.",00:02:05.190,00:02:10.270
"That's (delta theta) / This is
the fraction of area-- sorry,",00:02:10.270,00:02:16.720
"fraction of the
total circumference,",00:02:16.720,00:02:18.590
the total length around the rim.,00:02:18.590,00:02:20.900
"And then we multiply
that by pi a^2.",00:02:20.900,00:02:24.150
"And that's giving
us the total area.",00:02:24.150,00:02:27.000
"And if you work that out,
that's delta A is equal",00:02:27.000,00:02:30.500
"to, the pi's cancel and we
have 1/2 a^2 delta theta.",00:02:30.500,00:02:36.860
So here's the basic formula.,00:02:36.860,00:02:44.990
"And now what we need to do is to
talk about a variable pie here.",00:02:44.990,00:02:54.510
"That would be a pie with
a kind of a wavy crust.",00:02:54.510,00:02:58.790
"Which is coming
around like this.",00:02:58.790,00:03:01.520
So r = r(theta).,00:03:01.520,00:03:04.140
"The distance from
the center is varying",00:03:04.140,00:03:07.860
"with the place where we are, the
angle where we're shooting out.",00:03:07.860,00:03:13.420
"And now I want to subdivide
that into little chunks here.",00:03:13.420,00:03:22.070
"Now, the idea for adding
up the area, the total area",00:03:22.070,00:03:25.760
"of this piece
that's swept out, is",00:03:25.760,00:03:29.110
"to break it up into
little slices whose areas",00:03:29.110,00:03:33.160
are almost easy to calculate.,00:03:33.160,00:03:37.580
"Namely, what we're
going to do is to take,",00:03:37.580,00:03:42.900
"and I'm going to
label it this way.",00:03:42.900,00:03:46.000
"I'm going to take these little
circular arcs, which go--",00:03:46.000,00:03:49.520
"So I'm going to extend
past where this goes.",00:03:49.520,00:03:55.770
"And then I'm going to take
each circular arc here.",00:03:55.770,00:03:58.620
So here's a circular arc.,00:03:58.620,00:04:00.510
"And then here's
another circular arc.",00:04:00.510,00:04:04.010
And here's another circular arc.,00:04:04.010,00:04:05.590
"It's just right on
the nose in that case.",00:04:05.590,00:04:08.250
"Now, in these two
cases, so basically",00:04:08.250,00:04:12.050
"the picture that I'm trying
to draw for you is this.",00:04:12.050,00:04:14.910
I have some sector.,00:04:14.910,00:04:17.960
"And then I have
some circular arc.",00:04:17.960,00:04:19.445
"And maybe it takes
a little extra.",00:04:19.445,00:04:23.400
"There's a little extra area,
I'm making an error in the area.",00:04:23.400,00:04:26.780
This is a little extra area.,00:04:26.780,00:04:28.400
"And maybe to draw
it the other way.",00:04:28.400,00:04:32.410
I'm a little short on this one.,00:04:32.410,00:04:34.530
"And let's say on this one
I'm right on the nose.",00:04:34.530,00:04:37.190
"I have the same arc as
the curve of the surface.",00:04:37.190,00:04:42.950
"Now this is a little bit
like the step functions",00:04:42.950,00:04:45.580
that we used in Riemann sums.,00:04:45.580,00:04:47.240
It's practically the same.,00:04:47.240,00:04:48.940
"Eventually, this little band
of stuff that we're missing by,",00:04:48.940,00:04:52.490
"if we take very, very
narrow little slices here,",00:04:52.490,00:04:56.110
is going to be negligible.,00:04:56.110,00:04:58.610
"It'll get closer and
closer to the curve itself.",00:04:58.610,00:05:01.360
"So that area will tend
to 0 in the limit.",00:05:01.360,00:05:04.290
"So we don't have
to worry about it.",00:05:04.290,00:05:05.940
"And the approximate
relationship is sitting here.",00:05:05.940,00:05:09.970
Where this distance now is r.,00:05:09.970,00:05:12.110
So this radius is r.,00:05:12.110,00:05:14.340
And this is this delta theta.,00:05:14.340,00:05:18.330
"And so in the approximate case,
what we have is that delta A is",00:05:18.330,00:05:23.080
"approximately 1/2
r^2 delta theta.",00:05:23.080,00:05:28.830
"Which is practically the
same thing we had here.",00:05:28.830,00:05:30.840
"Except that that r is
replacing the constant there.",00:05:30.840,00:05:34.985
"And it's approximately
true, because r is varying.",00:05:34.985,00:05:39.290
"And then in the limit,
we have the exact formula",00:05:39.290,00:05:42.230
for the differential.,00:05:42.230,00:05:43.870
Which is this one.,00:05:43.870,00:05:46.200
"So this is the main
formula for area.",00:05:46.200,00:05:49.190
"And if you like, the total
area then is going to be",00:05:49.190,00:05:52.000
"the integral from some starting
place to some end place of 1/2",00:05:52.000,00:05:56.290
r^2 d theta.,00:05:56.290,00:05:57.070
"Now, this is only useful in
the situation that we're in.",00:06:00.020,00:06:04.210
"Namely-- So this is the
other important formula.",00:06:04.210,00:06:07.120
"And this is only useful when
r is a function of theta.",00:06:07.120,00:06:11.440
"When this is the way in which
the region is presented to us.",00:06:11.440,00:06:17.930
So that's the setup.,00:06:17.930,00:06:20.430
And that's our main formula.,00:06:20.430,00:06:23.310
Let's do what example.,00:06:23.310,00:06:27.884
"The example that
I'm going to take",00:06:27.884,00:06:29.300
"is the one that we did
at the end of last time,",00:06:29.300,00:06:31.750
or near the end of last time.,00:06:31.750,00:06:33.790
"Which was this formula
here. r = 2a cos(theta).",00:06:33.790,00:06:39.260
"Remember, that was the same
as (x-a)^2 + y^2 = a^2.",00:06:39.260,00:06:46.920
"So this is what
we did last time.",00:06:46.920,00:06:49.120
"We connected this
rectangular representation",00:06:49.120,00:06:53.550
to that polar representation.,00:06:53.550,00:06:54.920
And the picture is of a circle.,00:06:54.920,00:07:02.130
"Where this is the point (2a, 0).",00:07:02.130,00:07:11.580
"So let's figure out
what the area is.",00:07:11.580,00:07:16.140
"Well, first of all,
we have to figure out",00:07:16.140,00:07:19.480
"when we sweep out
the area, we have",00:07:19.480,00:07:22.040
"to realize that we only
go from -pi/2 to pi/2.",00:07:22.040,00:07:27.160
"So that's something we
can get from the picture.",00:07:27.160,00:07:30.620
"You can also get it
directly from this formula",00:07:30.620,00:07:32.900
"if you realize that cosine is
positive in this range here.",00:07:32.900,00:07:38.030
"And at the ends, it's 0.",00:07:38.030,00:07:40.430
"So the thing encloses
a region at these ends.",00:07:40.430,00:07:46.870
"So at the ends, cosine of plus
or minus pi/2 is equal to 0.",00:07:46.870,00:07:54.550
"That's what cinches this up
like a little sack, if you like.",00:07:54.550,00:08:02.320
"So the area is now going to be
the integral from -pi/2 to pi/2",00:08:02.320,00:08:07.530
"of 1/2 times the square of
r, that's (2a cos(theta))^2,",00:08:07.530,00:08:13.410
d theta.,00:08:13.410,00:08:18.111
Question.,00:08:18.111,00:08:18.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:08:18.610,00:08:25.434
"PROFESSOR: How do I know
from looking at the picture",00:08:25.434,00:08:27.600
"that I'm going from -pi/2
to pi/2, is the question.",00:08:27.600,00:08:33.400
I do it with my whole body.,00:08:33.400,00:08:36.820
"I say, here I am pointing down.",00:08:36.820,00:08:39.860
That's -pi/2.,00:08:39.860,00:08:41.120
"I sweep up, that's 0.",00:08:41.120,00:08:43.890
"And I get all the way
up to here. that's pi/2.",00:08:43.890,00:08:47.710
So that's the way I do it.,00:08:47.710,00:08:48.910
"That's really the way I
do it, I'm being honest.",00:08:48.910,00:08:51.450
"Now if you're a machine,
you can't actually look.",00:08:51.450,00:08:54.520
"And you don't have a body,
so you can't point your arms.",00:08:54.520,00:08:57.800
"Then you would have
to go by the formulas.",00:08:57.800,00:08:59.650
"And you'd have to actually use
something like this formula",00:08:59.650,00:09:02.950
here.,00:09:02.950,00:09:03.900
"The fact that this is
where the loop cinches up.",00:09:03.900,00:09:07.830
"This is where the
radius comes into 0.",00:09:07.830,00:09:10.750
At pi/2.,00:09:10.750,00:09:11.270
"So you need to know that in
order to understand the range.",00:09:11.270,00:09:17.230
Another question.,00:09:17.230,00:09:17.970
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:09:17.970,00:09:23.089
"PROFESSOR: So when
we're doing these,",00:09:23.089,00:09:24.630
"should we just guess that
it's going to be a loop?",00:09:24.630,00:09:28.000
"I'm probably going to give
you some clues as to what's",00:09:28.000,00:09:30.590
going on.,00:09:30.590,00:09:31.090
"Because it's very hard to
figure these things out.",00:09:31.090,00:09:33.990
"Sometimes it'll be bounded by
one curve and another curve,",00:09:33.990,00:09:36.920
"and I'll say it's the thing
in between those two curves.",00:09:36.920,00:09:39.780
"That's the kind of
thing that I could do.",00:09:39.780,00:09:42.710
"Here, you really should
know this one in advance.",00:09:42.710,00:09:47.590
"This is by far the
most-- or this is one",00:09:47.590,00:09:51.270
"of the typical cases, anyway.",00:09:51.270,00:09:52.540
"I'm going to give you
a couple more examples.",00:09:52.540,00:09:54.690
"Don't get too
worked up over this.",00:09:54.690,00:09:57.130
"You will somehow be
able to visualize it.",00:09:57.130,00:09:59.400
"I'll give you some examples
to help you out with it later.",00:09:59.400,00:10:05.070
So here's the situation.,00:10:05.070,00:10:06.360
Here's my integral.,00:10:06.360,00:10:07.620
"And now we're faced
with a trig integral.",00:10:07.620,00:10:10.450
"Which we have to
remember how to do.",00:10:10.450,00:10:12.970
"Now, the trig integral
here-- so first",00:10:12.970,00:10:14.770
let me factor out the constants.,00:10:14.770,00:10:16.760
"This is 4a 4a^2 / 2, so it's
2a^2 integral from -pi/2",00:10:16.760,00:10:21.740
to pi/2 of cos^2(theta) d theta.,00:10:21.740,00:10:26.870
"And now you have to
remember what you're",00:10:26.870,00:10:29.510
supposed to do at this point.,00:10:29.510,00:10:32.570
"So think, if you
haven't done it yet,",00:10:32.570,00:10:34.310
this is practice you need to do.,00:10:34.310,00:10:37.830
"This trig integral is handled
by a double angle formula.",00:10:37.830,00:10:40.660
"As it happens, I'm
going to be giving you",00:10:40.660,00:10:42.520
"these formulas on
the review sheet.",00:10:42.520,00:10:44.670
"You'll see they're written
on the review sheet.",00:10:44.670,00:10:47.480
At least in some form.,00:10:47.480,00:10:49.940
"So for example,
there's a formula,",00:10:49.940,00:10:51.940
"and this will be
on the exam, too.",00:10:51.940,00:10:54.480
"So this is the correct
formula to use here.",00:10:54.480,00:10:58.440
"Is that this is + (1 +
cos(2theta)) / 2 d theta.",00:10:58.440,00:11:04.240
"So that's the substitution that
you use for the cosine squared",00:11:04.240,00:11:08.230
in order to integrate it.,00:11:08.230,00:11:12.490
"That serves as a little
review of trig integrals.",00:11:12.490,00:11:15.440
"And now, this is quite easy.",00:11:15.440,00:11:18.830
This integral now is easy.,00:11:18.830,00:11:27.560
Why is it easy?,00:11:27.560,00:11:28.380
"Well, because it's
the antiderivative",00:11:28.380,00:11:30.640
"of a constant, cos(2theta),
its antiderivative",00:11:30.640,00:11:32.650
"you're supposed to be
able to write down.",00:11:32.650,00:11:34.640
"So the antiderivative
of 1 is theta.",00:11:34.640,00:11:36.820
"And the antiderivative
of the cosine",00:11:36.820,00:11:39.510
"is 1/2 the sine
when it's 2 theta.",00:11:39.510,00:11:50.120
"And that is a ^2 a^2
(pi/2 - (-pi/2)).",00:11:50.120,00:11:52.930
"And the signs go away
because they're both 0.",00:11:55.920,00:12:00.070
"So all told we get pi a^2, which
is certainly what we would like",00:12:00.070,00:12:04.900
it to be.,00:12:04.900,00:12:05.400
It's the area of the circle.,00:12:05.400,00:12:09.482
Another question?,00:12:09.482,00:12:10.190

"PROFESSOR: The
question, so I'm not",00:12:28.982,00:12:30.440
"sure which question
you're asking.",00:12:30.440,00:12:31.990
"I pivoted my arm around (0, 0).",00:12:31.990,00:12:35.360
"This point, this is the point
we're talking about, (0, 0),",00:12:35.360,00:12:38.550
is a key point.,00:12:38.550,00:12:39.290
"It's where I guess you could
say I stuck my elbow there.",00:12:39.290,00:12:43.310
"Now, the reason is that
it's the place where r = 0.",00:12:43.310,00:12:48.367
"So it's more or less the center
of the universe from the point",00:12:48.367,00:12:50.950
of view of this problem.,00:12:50.950,00:12:54.630
"So it's the reference
point and if you like,",00:12:54.630,00:12:57.730
"when you're doing this, it's a
little bit like a radar screen.",00:12:57.730,00:13:01.500
"Everything is
centered at the origin",00:13:01.500,00:13:03.050
"and you're taking rays
coming out from it.",00:13:03.050,00:13:07.135
"And seeing where
they're going to go.",00:13:07.135,00:13:10.390
"So for example, this
is the theta = 0 ray,",00:13:10.390,00:13:12.230
this is the theta = pi/4 ray.,00:13:12.230,00:13:15.240
This the theta = pi/2 ray.,00:13:15.240,00:13:17.930
"And indeed, if my elbow is
right at this center here,",00:13:17.930,00:13:21.250
"I'm pointing in those
various directions.",00:13:21.250,00:13:24.610
"So that's what I had in
mind when I did that.",00:13:24.610,00:13:32.650
"You can always get these
formulas, by the way,",00:13:32.650,00:13:35.140
"from the original business, x =
r cos(theta), y = r sin(theta).",00:13:35.140,00:13:42.120
"But it's useful to have the
geometric picture as well.",00:13:42.120,00:13:44.689
"In other words, if
you were a machine",00:13:44.689,00:13:46.230
"you'd have to rely
on these formulas.",00:13:46.230,00:13:48.150
And plot things using these.,00:13:48.150,00:13:49.480
Always.,00:13:49.480,00:13:57.090
"Now, in terms of plotting
I want to expand your brain",00:13:57.090,00:14:00.509
a little bit.,00:14:00.509,00:14:01.050
"So we need just a little bit
more practice with plotting.",00:14:01.050,00:14:03.810
In polar coordinates.,00:14:03.810,00:14:05.870
"And so, the first question
that I want to ask you",00:14:05.870,00:14:09.580
"is, what happens outside
of this range of theta?",00:14:09.580,00:14:15.370
"In other words, what happens
if theta's beyond pi/2?",00:14:15.370,00:14:19.960
"Can somebody see
what's happening",00:14:19.960,00:14:22.080
to the formulas in that case?,00:14:22.080,00:14:23.340
"So what I'm looking at
now, let's go back to it.",00:14:23.340,00:14:27.480
"What I'm looking at
is this formula here.",00:14:27.480,00:14:35.600
"But to use the
elbow analogy here,",00:14:35.600,00:14:37.690
I'm swept around like this.,00:14:37.690,00:14:39.280
"But now I'm going
to point this way.",00:14:39.280,00:14:40.810
"I'm going to point
out over there.",00:14:40.810,00:14:42.340
"My hand is up here in
the northwest direction.",00:14:42.340,00:14:49.450
So what's going to happen?,00:14:49.450,00:14:51.519
Somebody want to tell me?,00:14:51.519,00:14:52.560
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:14:52.560,00:14:55.210
"PROFESSOR: It goes
around itself.",00:14:55.210,00:14:56.920
That's right.,00:14:56.920,00:14:57.640
"What happens is that when r
crosses this vertical, r = 0,",00:14:57.640,00:15:02.400
"when it crosses over
here it goes negative.",00:15:02.400,00:15:05.210
"So although my theta is
pointing me this way,",00:15:05.210,00:15:08.540
"the thing is going
to go backwards.",00:15:08.540,00:15:10.490
And there's another clue.,00:15:10.490,00:15:12.590
Which is very important.,00:15:12.590,00:15:13.590
How far backwards is it going?,00:15:13.590,00:15:15.290
"Well, you don't actually need to
know anything but this equation",00:15:15.290,00:15:18.370
"here, to understand that it
has to be on the same circle.",00:15:18.370,00:15:23.530
"So when I'm pointing
this way, the things",00:15:23.530,00:15:26.040
"points backwards to
this point over there.",00:15:26.040,00:15:29.550
"So what happens is,
it goes around once.",00:15:29.550,00:15:32.012
"And then when I
point out this way,",00:15:32.012,00:15:33.470
it sweeps around a second time.,00:15:33.470,00:15:35.614
"It just keeps on going
around the same circle.",00:15:35.614,00:15:37.530
So over here it's empty.,00:15:37.530,00:15:38.867
"Because it's pointing
the other way and it's",00:15:38.867,00:15:40.700
sweeping around the same curve.,00:15:40.700,00:15:42.570
A second time.,00:15:42.570,00:15:47.600
"Now, if you were foolish
enough to integrate, say,",00:15:47.600,00:15:50.960
"from 0 to 2pi or some wider
range, what would happen",00:15:50.960,00:15:54.060
"is you would just
double the area.",00:15:54.060,00:15:55.810
"Because you would have
swept it out twice.",00:15:55.810,00:16:00.970
"So that's the mistake
that you'll make.",00:16:00.970,00:16:02.890
"Sometimes you'll count things
as negative and positive.",00:16:02.890,00:16:05.390
"But because there's
a square here,",00:16:05.390,00:16:07.392
it's always a positive quantity.,00:16:07.392,00:16:08.725
"And you'll always over-count
if you go too far.",00:16:08.725,00:16:13.890
So that's what happens.,00:16:13.890,00:16:15.930
"Again, it sweeps
out the same region.",00:16:15.930,00:16:17.930
"That's because these
two equations really",00:16:17.930,00:16:19.890
are equivalent to each other.,00:16:19.890,00:16:22.050
"It's just that this one
sweeps it out twice.",00:16:22.050,00:16:24.080
"And this one doesn't say
how it's sweeping it out.",00:16:24.080,00:16:28.930
"Yeah, another question.",00:16:28.930,00:16:30.380
"STUDENT: Doesn't this
equation also work",00:16:30.380,00:16:32.046
if you just go from 0 to pi?,00:16:32.046,00:16:34.320
"PROFESSOR: Does the
integration work",00:16:34.320,00:16:36.630
if you just go from 0 to pi?,00:16:36.630,00:16:38.900
The answer is yes.,00:16:38.900,00:16:40.730
"That's a very weird
object, though.",00:16:40.730,00:16:42.884
"Let me just show
you what that is.",00:16:42.884,00:16:44.300
If you started from 0 to 2pi.,00:16:44.300,00:16:47.360
So I'll illustrate it on here.,00:16:47.360,00:16:50.120
"The first thing that you
swept out between 0 and pi/2",00:16:50.120,00:16:53.290
is this part here.,00:16:53.290,00:16:54.750
That was swept out.,00:16:54.750,00:16:56.160
"And then, when you're going
around this next quadrant here,",00:16:56.160,00:17:00.190
"you're actually sweeping
out this underside here.",00:17:00.190,00:17:05.026
"So actually, you're
getting it because you're",00:17:05.026,00:17:06.900
"getting half of it on one half,
and getting the other half",00:17:06.900,00:17:09.710
on the other quadrant.,00:17:09.710,00:17:10.990
"So it's actually giving
you the right answer.",00:17:10.990,00:17:14.120
That turns out to be OK.,00:17:14.120,00:17:15.590
"It's a little weird way
to chop up a circle.",00:17:15.590,00:17:17.740
But it's legal.,00:17:17.740,00:17:23.706
"But of course,
that's an accident",00:17:23.706,00:17:25.080
of this particular figure.,00:17:25.080,00:17:26.260
"You can't count
on that happening.",00:17:26.260,00:17:27.830
"It's much better to
line it up exactly",00:17:27.830,00:17:29.580
with what the figure does.,00:17:29.580,00:17:32.240
So don't do that too often.,00:17:32.240,00:17:35.630
You might run into troubles.,00:17:35.630,00:17:40.640
"So I'm going to give you
a couple more examples",00:17:40.640,00:17:44.110
of practice with these pictures.,00:17:44.110,00:17:48.970
"And maybe I'm going to get
rid of this one up here.",00:17:48.970,00:17:57.080
So here's another favorite.,00:17:57.080,00:18:03.850
Here's another favorite.,00:18:03.850,00:18:05.140
"So this, if you
like, is Example 2.",00:18:05.140,00:18:08.000
"I guess we had an
Example 1 up there.",00:18:08.000,00:18:09.720
"And now we're really
not going to try",00:18:09.720,00:18:12.160
to do any more area examples.,00:18:12.160,00:18:13.690
"The area examples are
actually straightforward.",00:18:13.690,00:18:15.900
"It's really just figuring out
what the picture looks like.",00:18:15.900,00:18:18.830
So this is examples of drawings.,00:18:18.830,00:18:27.200
"So this one is one
that's kind of fun to do.",00:18:27.200,00:18:34.890
This is r = sin(2theta).,00:18:34.890,00:18:37.500
"Something like this
is on your homework.",00:18:37.500,00:18:40.120
"And so what happens
here is the following.",00:18:40.120,00:18:46.830
"What happens here is
that at theta = 0,",00:18:46.830,00:18:50.850
that's the first place.,00:18:50.850,00:18:53.100
"So let's just plot
a few places here.",00:18:53.100,00:18:56.470
I'm not going to plot very many.,00:18:56.470,00:18:57.960
"Theta = 0, I get r is 1.",00:18:57.960,00:19:00.590
"Whoops, I get r is 0.",00:19:00.590,00:19:02.940
Sorry.,00:19:02.940,00:19:04.020
"And then pi/4, that's where I
get sin(pi/2), I get 1 here.",00:19:04.020,00:19:09.900
For this.,00:19:09.900,00:19:10.570
"And then again, at
pi/2 I get sin(pi),",00:19:10.570,00:19:14.400
which is back at 0 again.,00:19:14.400,00:19:17.090
"So it's-- And the other thing
to say is in between here",00:19:17.090,00:19:21.010
it's positive.,00:19:21.010,00:19:21.810
In between.,00:19:21.810,00:19:22.860
"So what it does is,
it starts out at 0",00:19:22.860,00:19:26.120
"and it goes out to the
radius 1 over here.",00:19:26.120,00:19:30.290
And then it comes back.,00:19:30.290,00:19:32.640
So it does something like this.,00:19:32.640,00:19:35.350
"It goes out, and it comes back.",00:19:35.350,00:19:39.790
"Now because of the symmetries
of the sine function,",00:19:39.790,00:19:44.900
"this is pretty much
all you need to know.",00:19:44.900,00:19:47.070
"It does something similar
in all of the quadrants.",00:19:47.070,00:19:51.550
"But in order to see what it's
doing, it's useful for you",00:19:51.550,00:19:56.000
to watch me draw it.,00:19:56.000,00:19:57.450
"Because the order is very
important for understanding",00:19:57.450,00:20:00.930
what it's doing.,00:20:00.930,00:20:01.970
"It's similar to this weird
business with the circle here.",00:20:01.970,00:20:06.170
So watch me draw this guy.,00:20:06.170,00:20:09.110
"I'll draw it in red because
it usually has a name.",00:20:09.110,00:20:11.700
So here it is.,00:20:11.700,00:20:12.870
It does this thing.,00:20:12.870,00:20:15.450
And then it does this.,00:20:15.450,00:20:17.280
And then it does this.,00:20:17.280,00:20:19.330
And then it does that.,00:20:19.330,00:20:21.770
So it's called a four-leaf rose.,00:20:21.770,00:20:26.130
"I drew it in pink because
it's kind of a rose here.",00:20:26.130,00:20:30.380
So it started out over here.,00:20:30.380,00:20:32.050
This is Step 1.,00:20:32.050,00:20:34.800
"And this is the range
0 &lt; theta &lt; pi/4.",00:20:34.800,00:20:40.370
It did this part here.,00:20:40.370,00:20:42.200
And then it went 2 here.,00:20:42.200,00:20:46.180
"So I should draw these
in white, because they're",00:20:46.180,00:20:48.510
harder to read in red.,00:20:48.510,00:20:50.580
But now look at what it did.,00:20:50.580,00:20:52.800
"It did not make a
right angle turn.",00:20:52.800,00:20:55.160
It was nice and smooth.,00:20:55.160,00:20:56.930
"It went around here and
then it went down here.",00:20:56.930,00:20:59.500
This is 3.,00:20:59.500,00:21:00.900
"Back here, that's 4.",00:21:00.900,00:21:02.840
"And then over here, that's 5.",00:21:02.840,00:21:05.370
"Back up here, that's 6.",00:21:05.370,00:21:07.540
"And then around here, that's 7.",00:21:07.540,00:21:09.650
"And down here, that's 8.",00:21:09.650,00:21:11.030
"And then back where it
started and goes around again.",00:21:11.030,00:21:14.750
"And this is because
actually it's switching sign",00:21:14.750,00:21:17.940
when it crosses the origin.,00:21:17.940,00:21:19.470
"When it was over in this
quadrant the first time,",00:21:19.470,00:21:21.620
"it actually was tracing
what's directly behind it.",00:21:21.620,00:21:28.050
So this is kind of amusing.,00:21:28.050,00:21:29.470
"From this little tiny formula
you get this pretty diagram",00:21:29.470,00:21:33.681
here.,00:21:33.681,00:21:34.180
"Anyway that's, as I
say, an old favorite.",00:21:34.180,00:21:36.490
"And here if you want to
do the area of one leaf,",00:21:36.490,00:21:40.490
"you've got to make sure
you understand that it's",00:21:40.490,00:21:42.810
a small piece of the whole.,00:21:42.810,00:21:49.650
"OK, now I have one
last drawing example",00:21:49.650,00:21:52.230
that I want to discuss with you.,00:21:52.230,00:21:54.280
"And it involves another
skill that we haven't quite",00:21:54.280,00:21:57.150
gotten enough practice with.,00:21:57.150,00:21:59.550
So I'm going to do that one.,00:21:59.550,00:22:01.320
"And it's also preparation
for an exercise.",00:22:01.320,00:22:04.210
"But one that we're going
to do after the test.",00:22:04.210,00:22:08.360
So here's my last example.,00:22:08.360,00:22:15.110
"We're going to discuss what
happens with this function",00:22:15.110,00:22:18.300
here.,00:22:18.300,00:22:20.510
"Sorry, that's not
legible, is it.",00:22:20.510,00:22:23.440
"That's a cosine. r = r
= 1/(1 + 2cos(theta)).",00:22:23.440,00:22:29.790
"Now, the first
thing I want to do",00:22:35.310,00:22:37.470
"is just take our time a little
bit and plot a few points.",00:22:37.470,00:22:44.400
"So here's the values of theta
and here are the values of r,",00:22:44.400,00:22:48.260
and we'll see what happens.,00:22:48.260,00:22:49.770
"And we'll try to figure
out what it's doing.",00:22:49.770,00:22:52.450
"When theta = 0, cosine is 1.",00:22:52.450,00:22:56.440
So r = 1/3.,00:22:56.440,00:23:01.230
"The denominator is
1 + 2, so it's 1/3.",00:23:01.230,00:23:07.950
"If theta-- I'm going
to make it easy,",00:23:07.950,00:23:10.060
we're not going to do so many.,00:23:10.060,00:23:11.540
"I'm going to do pi/2, that's
an easy value of the cosine.",00:23:11.540,00:23:16.120
That's cos(pi/2) = 0.,00:23:16.120,00:23:18.200
So that value of r = 1.,00:23:18.200,00:23:23.070
"And now I'm going to
back up and do -pi/2.",00:23:23.070,00:23:30.060
"-pi/2, again, cosine is 0.",00:23:30.060,00:23:33.390
And r = 1.,00:23:33.390,00:23:39.500
"So now I'd like to just plot
those points anyway, and see",00:23:39.500,00:23:42.930
"what's going on with
this expression here.",00:23:42.930,00:23:47.410
"The first one is a
rectangular-- I'm",00:23:47.410,00:23:49.910
"going to write the
rectangular coordinates here,",00:23:49.910,00:23:53.450
not the polar coordinates.,00:23:53.450,00:23:56.010
"The rectangular coordinates here
are 1/3 out at the horizontal,",00:23:56.010,00:24:01.670
"so it's (1/3, 0).",00:24:01.670,00:24:04.220
"The polar coordinates
is (1/3, 0),",00:24:04.220,00:24:07.300
"but the rectangular
coordinate is also that.",00:24:07.300,00:24:10.890
"And over here, at pi/2,
the distance is 1.",00:24:10.890,00:24:14.610
"So this is the point (0,
1) in x-y coordinates.",00:24:14.610,00:24:18.940
"And then down here at,
-pi/2, it's (0, -1).",00:24:18.940,00:24:26.940
Let me just emphasize.,00:24:26.940,00:24:28.817
"You should be able to
think of this visually",00:24:28.817,00:24:30.650
"if you can crank your
arm around and think it.",00:24:30.650,00:24:33.590
"Or if you're right-handed
you'll bend that way, no.",00:24:33.590,00:24:37.630
Anyway.,00:24:37.630,00:24:38.270
"Or you'll have to
use-- But this also",00:24:38.270,00:24:40.250
"works using this formulas x =
r cos(theta), y = r sin(theta).",00:24:40.250,00:24:48.890
"Notice that in this case, r
was 1 but the cosine was 0.",00:24:48.890,00:24:53.010
So you plug in theta = -pi/2.,00:24:53.010,00:24:57.100
And r = 1.,00:24:57.100,00:24:58.990
"And lo and behold,
you get 0 here.",00:24:58.990,00:25:01.520
"And here you get
-1 here you get 1.",00:25:01.520,00:25:03.640
So this is -1.,00:25:03.640,00:25:05.830
So this is an example.,00:25:05.830,00:25:07.750
"I did it purely visually
or sort of organically.",00:25:07.750,00:25:11.960
"But you can also do it by
plugging in the numbers.",00:25:11.960,00:25:16.190
"Now in between, the
denominator is positive.",00:25:16.190,00:25:21.130
And it's something in between.,00:25:21.130,00:25:22.810
"It's going to sweep around
something like this.",00:25:22.810,00:25:26.600
That's what happens in between.,00:25:26.600,00:25:29.200
"As theta increases
from -pi/2 to pi/2.",00:25:29.200,00:25:32.090
"And now something
interesting happens",00:25:34.600,00:25:36.430
"with this particular
function, which",00:25:36.430,00:25:38.260
"is that we notice that
the denominator is",00:25:38.260,00:25:40.450
0 at a certain place.,00:25:40.450,00:25:43.280
"Namely, if I solve
2 cos(theta) = -1,",00:25:43.280,00:25:48.610
"then the denominator
is going to be 0 there.",00:25:48.610,00:25:51.290
"That's cos(theta) =
-1/2, so theta is equal",00:25:51.290,00:25:57.470
"to, it turns out,
plus or minus 2pi/3.",00:25:57.470,00:26:01.240
Those are the values here.,00:26:01.240,00:26:03.800
"So when we're out here
somewhere, in these directions,",00:26:03.800,00:26:09.050
there's nothing.,00:26:09.050,00:26:10.120
It's going infinitely far out.,00:26:10.120,00:26:14.220
Those ways.,00:26:14.220,00:26:20.120
"OK that's about as
much as we'll be",00:26:20.120,00:26:22.500
"able to figure out
of this diagram",00:26:22.500,00:26:24.740
"without doing some
analytic work.",00:26:24.740,00:26:26.980
"And that's the other little
piece that I want to explain.",00:26:26.980,00:26:31.970
"Namely, going backwards
from polar coordinates",00:26:31.970,00:26:34.700
to rectangular coordinates.,00:26:34.700,00:26:36.740
"Which is one thing
that we haven't done.",00:26:36.740,00:26:38.930
So let's do that.,00:26:38.930,00:26:40.870
"So what is the
rectangular equation?",00:26:40.870,00:26:48.680
"That means the (x, y)
equation for this r = 1 /",00:26:48.680,00:26:59.690
(1 + 2cos(theta)).,00:26:59.690,00:27:00.440
And let's see what it is.,00:27:03.400,00:27:06.320
"Well, first I'm going to
clear the denominator here.",00:27:06.320,00:27:08.850
This is r + 2r cos(theta) = 1.,00:27:08.850,00:27:15.200
"And now I'm going to rewrite
it as r = 1 - 2r cos(theta).",00:27:15.200,00:27:23.020
"And the reason for that
is that in a minute",00:27:23.020,00:27:25.280
I'll explain to you why.,00:27:25.280,00:27:27.300
This is 1 - 2x.,00:27:27.300,00:27:29.620
"And this guy, I'm
going to square now.",00:27:29.620,00:27:32.810
"I'm going to make
this r^2 = (1 - 2x)^2.",00:27:32.810,00:27:38.010
"And now, with an r^2, I
can plug in x^2 + y^2.",00:27:38.010,00:27:41.030
"So this is a
standard thing to do.",00:27:49.680,00:27:53.381
"And it's basically
what you're going",00:27:53.381,00:27:54.880
"to do any time you're faced
with an equation like this.",00:27:54.880,00:27:57.870
Is try to work it out.,00:27:57.870,00:27:59.470
"And, in these situations
where you have 1 /",00:27:59.470,00:28:04.180
"(a + b cos(theta)),
or sin(theta),",00:28:04.180,00:28:06.990
"you'll always come out with some
quadratic expression like this.",00:28:06.990,00:28:12.400
"Now, I'm going to combine terms.",00:28:12.400,00:28:14.590
"So here I have -3x^2 + y^2, and
put everything on the the left",00:28:14.590,00:28:19.921
side.,00:28:19.921,00:28:20.420
So that's this.,00:28:20.420,00:28:24.390
"And we recognize, well
you're supposed to recognize,",00:28:24.390,00:28:28.140
"that this is what's
known as a hyperbola.",00:28:28.140,00:28:36.580
"If the signs are the
same, it's an ellipse.",00:28:36.580,00:28:39.620
"If the the signs are
opposite it's a hyperbola.",00:28:39.620,00:28:42.390
"And in between, if one of the
coefficients on the quadratic",00:28:42.390,00:28:44.920
"is 0, it's a parabola.",00:28:44.920,00:28:49.210
"So now we see that the picture
that we drew there is actually,",00:28:49.210,00:28:54.844
"turns out it's going
to have asymptotes,",00:28:54.844,00:28:56.510
it's going to be a hyperbola.,00:28:56.510,00:29:01.920
"So now, let me ask you the last
little mind-bending question",00:29:01.920,00:29:06.650
that I want to ask.,00:29:06.650,00:29:08.020
"Which is, what happens-- So
now I'm using my right arm,",00:29:08.020,00:29:12.060
I guess.,00:29:12.060,00:29:12.770
"But my elbow's at
the origin here.",00:29:12.770,00:29:14.190
"What happens if I pass
outside, to the range where",00:29:14.190,00:29:18.290
this denominator is negative.,00:29:18.290,00:29:20.280
"It crossed 0 and it
went to negative.",00:29:20.280,00:29:24.210
"It's sweeping out
something over here.",00:29:24.210,00:29:28.050
"Is it sweeping out
the same curve?",00:29:28.050,00:29:32.420
"Anybody have any
idea what it's doing?",00:29:32.420,00:29:34.320
Yeah.,00:29:34.320,00:29:34.820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:29:34.820,00:29:37.460
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.",00:29:37.460,00:29:38.590
Good answer.,00:29:38.590,00:29:39.090
"It's the other branch
of the hyperbola.",00:29:39.090,00:29:44.220
"So what's actually
happening is in disguise,",00:29:44.220,00:29:46.390
"there's another branch
of the hyperbola",00:29:46.390,00:29:48.015
"which is being swept up by
the other piece of this thing.",00:29:48.015,00:29:50.700
"Now, that is consistent with
these algebraic equations.",00:29:50.700,00:29:54.220
"The algebraic equation
that I got here",00:29:54.220,00:29:56.500
"doesn't say which branch
of the hyperbola I've got.",00:29:56.500,00:30:00.900
It's actually got two branches.,00:30:00.900,00:30:05.930
"And the curve really
was, in disguise,",00:30:05.930,00:30:07.960
capturing both of them.,00:30:07.960,00:30:12.130
"I want to make
the connection now",00:30:12.130,00:30:14.250
"with the basic
formula for area here.",00:30:14.250,00:30:18.770
"Because this is a really
beautiful connection.",00:30:18.770,00:30:22.920
"And I want to make that
connection in connection",00:30:22.920,00:30:26.520
also with this example.,00:30:26.520,00:30:29.110
"The hyperbolas, as
you probably know,",00:30:29.110,00:30:32.750
are the trajectories of comets.,00:30:32.750,00:30:37.770
"And ellipses, which is what you
would get if maybe you put 1/2",00:30:37.770,00:30:42.290
"here instead of a 2,
would be the trajectories",00:30:42.290,00:30:44.570
of planets or asteroids.,00:30:44.570,00:30:47.450
"But there's actually
something much more important,",00:30:47.450,00:30:51.770
physically that goes on.,00:30:51.770,00:30:53.410
"That's special about this
particular representation",00:30:53.410,00:30:56.820
of the hyperbola.,00:30:56.820,00:30:58.900
"And what happens when you
get the ellipses as well.",00:30:58.900,00:31:01.610
"Which is that in
this case, r = 0",00:31:01.610,00:31:06.860
is the focus of the hyperbola.,00:31:06.860,00:31:17.520
"And what that means
is that it's actually",00:31:17.520,00:31:21.390
the place where the sun is.,00:31:21.390,00:31:28.910
"So this is the right
representation,",00:31:28.910,00:31:31.220
"if you want the
center of gravity",00:31:31.220,00:31:32.670
in the center of your picture.,00:31:32.670,00:31:36.720
And pretty much any other.,00:31:36.720,00:31:38.540
"I mean, you can't
tell that at all",00:31:38.540,00:31:40.050
"from the algebraic
equations here.",00:31:40.050,00:31:43.150
"So this hyperbola is
going to be the trajectory",00:31:43.150,00:31:46.340
of some comet going by here.,00:31:46.340,00:31:51.900
"And this formula
here is actually",00:31:51.900,00:31:57.240
"a rather central
formula in astronomy.",00:31:57.240,00:32:05.040
"Namely, there's something
called Kepler's Law.",00:32:05.040,00:32:17.100
"Which says that the rate
of change of area which",00:32:17.100,00:32:23.820
is swept out is constant.,00:32:23.820,00:32:28.674
"The rate of change of area
relative to the center of mass,",00:32:28.674,00:32:31.090
relative to the sun.,00:32:31.090,00:32:33.640
"So in equal areas,
this is amount of area.",00:32:33.640,00:32:37.000
"So this tells you now that when
a comet goes around the sun",00:32:37.000,00:32:43.570
"like this, its speed varies.",00:32:43.570,00:32:46.500
"And it's speed varies according
to a very specific rule.",00:32:46.500,00:32:49.180
"Namely, this one here.",00:32:49.180,00:32:52.220
"And this rule was
observed by Kepler.",00:32:52.220,00:32:54.960
"But if you have this
connection here,",00:32:54.960,00:32:57.910
we also have something else.,00:32:57.910,00:32:59.400
"We also know that dA/dt
= 1/2 r^2 d theta / dt.",00:32:59.400,00:33:08.390
"So that's this formula here,
formally dividing by t.",00:33:08.390,00:33:13.387
"That's the rate of
change with respect",00:33:13.387,00:33:14.970
"to this time parameter, which
is the honest to goodness time.",00:33:14.970,00:33:18.040
Real physical time.,00:33:18.040,00:33:20.820
"And that means, this
quantity here is constant.",00:33:20.820,00:33:34.920
"And this is one of
the key insights",00:33:34.920,00:33:37.810
"that physicists had,
long after Kepler",00:33:37.810,00:33:41.540
"made his physical
observations, they realized",00:33:41.540,00:33:43.760
"that he had managed to get the
best physics experiment of all,",00:33:43.760,00:33:48.280
"because it's a
frictionless setup.",00:33:48.280,00:33:50.790
"Outer space, there's no air.",00:33:50.790,00:33:53.320
Nothing is going on.,00:33:53.320,00:33:54.710
"This is what's known
nowadays as conservation",00:33:54.710,00:33:59.260
of angular momentum.,00:33:59.260,00:34:10.030
"This is the expression
for angular momentum.",00:34:10.030,00:34:13.720
"And what Kepler was
observing, it turns out,",00:34:13.720,00:34:16.810
"is what we see all
the time in real life.",00:34:16.810,00:34:18.924
"Which is when you start
something spinning around it",00:34:18.924,00:34:21.090
"continues to spin at
roughly the same rate.",00:34:21.090,00:34:23.570
"Or, if you're an
ice skater and you",00:34:23.570,00:34:26.517
"get yourself scrunched
together a little bit more,",00:34:26.517,00:34:28.600
you can spin faster.,00:34:28.600,00:34:30.330
"And there's an exact
quantitative rule",00:34:30.330,00:34:32.850
that does that.,00:34:32.850,00:34:33.740
"And it's exactly this
polar formula here.",00:34:33.740,00:34:38.240
So that's a neat thing.,00:34:38.240,00:34:39.730
"And we will do a little
exercise on this rate of change",00:34:39.730,00:34:43.280
after the exam.,00:34:43.280,00:34:45.780
"So that's it for generalities
and a little pep talk",00:34:45.780,00:34:52.030
"on what's coming
up to you when you",00:34:52.030,00:34:54.940
learn a little more physics.,00:34:54.940,00:34:57.820
"Right now we need to
talk about the exam.",00:34:57.820,00:35:04.660
"So first of all, let me tell
you what the topics are.",00:35:04.660,00:35:14.010
"They're the same as
last year's test.",00:35:14.010,00:35:17.500
Which you can take a look at.,00:35:17.500,00:35:19.990
And let's see.,00:35:19.990,00:35:24.060
So what did we do?,00:35:24.060,00:35:25.920
"One of the main
topics of this unit",00:35:25.920,00:35:29.960
were techniques of integration.,00:35:29.960,00:35:35.660
"And there are three,
which we will test.",00:35:35.660,00:35:40.390
One is trig substitution.,00:35:40.390,00:35:46.660
One is integration by parts.,00:35:46.660,00:35:53.950
And one is partial fractions.,00:35:53.950,00:36:02.000
"So that's more than half
of the exam, right there.",00:36:02.000,00:36:06.020
