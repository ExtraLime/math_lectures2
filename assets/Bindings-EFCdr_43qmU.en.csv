"PROFESSOR: So for
this last class",00:00:24.220,00:00:26.320
"exercise we have
this following code.",00:00:26.320,00:00:30.920
"So we have 46 for USA
gold, 27 for UK gold,",00:00:30.920,00:00:35.750
1 for Romanian gold.,00:00:35.750,00:00:38.140
"We make this variable,
here, Total Gold,",00:00:38.140,00:00:41.830
"to be the sum of those
three which I believe is 74.",00:00:41.830,00:00:46.060
"Then we're going to
print total gold.",00:00:46.060,00:00:48.240
OK?,00:00:48.240,00:00:49.007
"Then we're going to increase
the value for Romanian gold",00:00:49.007,00:00:51.340
"and we're going
to print it again.",00:00:51.340,00:00:53.200
"So as always, you can just
copy this, pop it into Python,",00:00:53.200,00:00:58.330
"and run it to test yourself,
but you should do it just",00:00:58.330,00:01:02.080
in your mind first.,00:01:02.080,00:01:03.650
"So notice it print
74 in 74, and that's",00:01:03.650,00:01:06.670
"because we never
told the program",00:01:06.670,00:01:08.470
to calculate the new total.,00:01:08.470,00:01:12.400
"So we only calculated the
total, way up here on line 5.",00:01:12.400,00:01:18.020
"If we calculated the
total again down here,",00:01:18.020,00:01:22.790
"then it would be 74.75 So
let's look at the answers,",00:01:22.790,00:01:28.340
hopefully you guys got that.,00:01:28.340,00:01:31.340
"Perfect, majority
are good to go.",00:01:31.340,00:01:34.200
"If you didn't get that
please try to review it,",00:01:34.200,00:01:37.340
review why it didn't work.,00:01:37.340,00:01:39.620
