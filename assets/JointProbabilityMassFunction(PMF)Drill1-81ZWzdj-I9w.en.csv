Welcome back guys.,00:00:00.550,00:00:02.250
"Today we're going to work on
a problem that tests your",00:00:02.250,00:00:05.080
knowledge of joint PMFs.,00:00:05.080,00:00:07.550
"And we're also going to get
some practice computing",00:00:07.550,00:00:09.620
"conditional expectations and
conditional variances.",00:00:09.620,00:00:13.200
"So in this problem, we
are given a set of",00:00:13.200,00:00:15.740
points in the xy plane.,00:00:15.740,00:00:17.610
"And we're told that these points
are equally likely.",00:00:17.610,00:00:20.290
So there's eight of them.,00:00:20.290,00:00:21.210
And each point has a,00:00:21.210,00:00:22.410
probability of 1/8 of occurring.,00:00:22.410,00:00:25.500
"And we're also given this
list of questions.",00:00:25.500,00:00:27.900
"And we're going to work
through them together.",00:00:27.900,00:00:30.670
"So in part a, we are asked to
find the values of x that",00:00:30.670,00:00:34.590
"maximize the conditional
expectation of y given x.",00:00:34.590,00:00:39.010
"So jumping right in, this
is the quantity",00:00:39.010,00:00:42.300
we're interested in.,00:00:42.300,00:00:45.190
"And so this quantity
is a function of x.",00:00:45.190,00:00:50.610
"You plug-in various
values of x.",00:00:50.610,00:00:53.430
"And then this will spit
out a scalar value.",00:00:53.430,00:00:56.630
"And that value will correspond
to the conditional expectation",00:00:56.630,00:00:59.970
"of y conditioned on the value
of x that you put in.",00:00:59.970,00:01:04.640
"So let's see, when x is equal
to 0, for instance, let's",00:01:04.640,00:01:09.690
figure out what this value is.,00:01:09.690,00:01:11.410
"Well, when x is equal to 0
we're living in a world,",00:01:11.410,00:01:15.790
"essentially, on this line.",00:01:15.790,00:01:17.660
"So that means that
only these two",00:01:17.660,00:01:19.520
points could have occurred.,00:01:19.520,00:01:20.730
"And in particular, y can only
take on the values of 1 and 3.",00:01:20.730,00:01:25.550
"Now, since all these points in
the unconditional universe",00:01:25.550,00:01:28.580
"were equally likely, in the
conditional universe they will",00:01:28.580,00:01:31.740
still be equally likely.,00:01:31.740,00:01:33.530
"So this happens with
probability 1/2.",00:01:33.530,00:01:35.620
"And this happens with
probability 1/2.",00:01:35.620,00:01:38.640
"And therefore, the expectation
would just be 3/2 plus 1/2",00:01:38.640,00:01:45.960
"which is 4/2, or 2.",00:01:45.960,00:01:49.380
"But a much faster way of seeing
this-- and it's the",00:01:49.380,00:01:51.700
"strategy that I'm going to use
for the rest of the problem--",00:01:51.700,00:01:54.300
"is to remember that
expectation acts",00:01:54.300,00:01:56.720
like center of mass.,00:01:56.720,00:01:58.780
"So the center of mass, when
these two points are equally",00:01:58.780,00:02:01.490
"likely, is just the midpoint,
which of course is 2.",00:02:01.490,00:02:05.010
"So we're going to use that
intuition on the other ones.",00:02:05.010,00:02:09.400
"So I'm skipping to x is
equal to 2 because 1",00:02:09.400,00:02:12.730
and 3 are not possible.,00:02:12.730,00:02:14.230
"So when x is equal to 2,
y can only take on the",00:02:14.230,00:02:17.000
values of 1 or 2.,00:02:17.000,00:02:18.490
"Again, they're equally likely.",00:02:18.490,00:02:20.240
"So the center of mass is in the
middle which happens at",00:02:20.240,00:02:22.390
1.5 or 3/2.,00:02:22.390,00:02:24.000
 ,00:02:24.000,00:02:26.540
"Similarly, x is equal to 4.",00:02:26.540,00:02:29.230
"We're living in this conditional
universe, where y",00:02:29.230,00:02:31.736
"can take on of these
four points with",00:02:31.736,00:02:34.380
probability 1/4 each.,00:02:34.380,00:02:36.870
"And so again, we expect
the center of mass to",00:02:36.870,00:02:39.920
be at 1.5 or 3/2.,00:02:39.920,00:02:42.850
"And this quantity is undefined
otherwise.",00:02:42.850,00:02:45.555
 ,00:02:45.555,00:02:48.650
"OK, so we're almost done.",00:02:48.650,00:02:50.540
"Now we just need to find which
value of x maximizes this.",00:02:50.540,00:02:55.240
"Well, let's see, 2 is the
biggest quantity out of all of",00:02:55.240,00:02:58.460
these numbers.,00:02:58.460,00:02:59.630
So the maximum is 2.,00:02:59.630,00:03:01.320
"And it occurs when
x is equal to 0.",00:03:01.320,00:03:04.090
So we come over here.,00:03:04.090,00:03:05.860
And we found our answer.,00:03:05.860,00:03:07.400
"x is equal to 0 is the value,
which maximizes the",00:03:07.400,00:03:10.780
"conditional expectation
of y given x.",00:03:10.780,00:03:13.930
"So part b is very similar
to part a.",00:03:13.930,00:03:15.970
"But there is slightly more
computation involved.",00:03:15.970,00:03:18.310
"Because now we're dealing with
the variance and not an",00:03:18.310,00:03:21.170
expectation.,00:03:21.170,00:03:22.395
"And variance is usually a little
bit tougher to compute.",00:03:22.395,00:03:28.220
"So we're going to start
in the same manner.",00:03:28.220,00:03:30.250
"But I want you guys to see if
you can figure out intuitively",00:03:30.250,00:03:34.490
what the right value is.,00:03:34.490,00:03:36.160
"I'm going to do the entire
computation now.",00:03:36.160,00:03:38.160
"And then you can compare whether
your intuition matches",00:03:38.160,00:03:41.070
with the real results.,00:03:41.070,00:03:43.320
"So variance of x conditioned
on a particular value of y,",00:03:43.320,00:03:49.560
this is now a function of y.,00:03:49.560,00:03:51.770
"For each value of y you plug in
you're going to get out a",00:03:51.770,00:03:54.430
scalar number.,00:03:54.430,00:03:55.500
"And that number represents the
conditional variance of x when",00:03:55.500,00:03:58.680
"you condition on the value
of y that you plugged in.",00:03:58.680,00:04:02.040
"So let's see, when y is equal
to 0 we have a nice case.",00:04:02.040,00:04:07.440
"If y is equal to 0 we have no
freedom about what x is.",00:04:07.440,00:04:11.680
"This is the only point that
could have occurred.",00:04:11.680,00:04:13.820
"Therefore, x definitely
takes on a value of 4.",00:04:13.820,00:04:17.279
"And there's no uncertainty
left.",00:04:17.279,00:04:19.920
"So in other words, the
variance is 0.",00:04:19.920,00:04:23.220
"Now, if y is equal to 1, x can
take on a value of 0, a value",00:04:23.220,00:04:30.040
of 2 or a value of 4.,00:04:30.040,00:04:31.990
"And these all have the same
probability of occurring, of",00:04:31.990,00:04:35.220
"1/3,",00:04:35.220,00:04:36.240
"And again, the reasoning behind
that is that all eight",00:04:36.240,00:04:38.920
"points were equally likely in
the unconditional universe.",00:04:38.920,00:04:42.430
"If you condition on y being
equal to 1 these outcomes",00:04:42.430,00:04:46.990
"still have the same relative
frequency.",00:04:46.990,00:04:48.970
"Namely, they're still
equally likely.",00:04:48.970,00:04:51.190
"And since there are three
of them they now have a",00:04:51.190,00:04:53.020
probability of 1/3 each.,00:04:53.020,00:04:55.730
"So we're going to go ahead and
use a formula that hopefully,",00:04:55.730,00:05:01.430
you guys remember.,00:05:01.430,00:05:04.080
"So in particular, variance is
the expectation of x squared",00:05:04.080,00:05:11.010
"minus the expectation
of x all squared,",00:05:11.010,00:05:15.520
the whole thing squared.,00:05:15.520,00:05:16.920
"So let's start by computing
this number first.",00:05:16.920,00:05:20.380
"So conditioned on y
is equal to 1--",00:05:20.380,00:05:22.770
so we're in this line--,00:05:22.770,00:05:24.095
"the expectation of x
is just 2, right?",00:05:24.095,00:05:27.140
"The same center-of-mass
to argument.",00:05:27.140,00:05:29.660
"So this, we have a minus
2 squared over here.",00:05:29.660,00:05:34.650
"Now, x squared is only slightly
more difficult.",00:05:34.650,00:05:38.450
"With probability 1/3,
x squared will take",00:05:38.450,00:05:41.960
on a value of 0.,00:05:41.960,00:05:43.650
"With probability 1/3,
x squared will take",00:05:43.650,00:05:46.510
on a value of 4.,00:05:46.510,00:05:47.990
I'm just doing 2 squared.,00:05:47.990,00:05:49.190
"And with probability 1/3, x
squared takes on a value of 4",00:05:49.190,00:05:53.180
squared or 16.,00:05:53.180,00:05:55.520
"So writing down when I just
said, we have 0 times 1/3",00:05:55.520,00:05:58.960
which is 0.,00:05:58.960,00:06:00.610
"We have 2 squared, which
is 4 times 1/3.",00:06:00.610,00:06:04.310
"And then we have 4 squared,
which is 16 times 1/3.",00:06:04.310,00:06:08.960
"And then we have our minus
4 from before.",00:06:08.960,00:06:11.710
"So doing this math out, we get,
let's see, 20/3 minus",00:06:11.710,00:06:18.260
"12/3, which is equal
to 8/3, or 8/3.",00:06:18.260,00:06:23.320
"So we'll come back up
here and put 8/3.",00:06:23.320,00:06:26.790
"So I realize I'm going through
this pretty quickly.",00:06:26.790,00:06:30.270
"Hopefully this step didn't
confuse you.",00:06:30.270,00:06:32.280
"Essentially, when I was doing
is, if you think of x squared",00:06:32.280,00:06:35.850
"as a new random variable, x
squared, the possible values",00:06:35.850,00:06:40.180
"that it can take on are 0,
4, and 16 when you're",00:06:40.180,00:06:44.240
"conditioning on y
is equal to 1.",00:06:44.240,00:06:47.380
"And so I was simply saying
that that random variable",00:06:47.380,00:06:51.490
"takes on those values with
equal probability.",00:06:51.490,00:06:56.960
"So let's move on to
the next one.",00:06:56.960,00:06:59.730
"So if we condition on y is equal
to 2 we're going to do a",00:06:59.730,00:07:03.370
very similar computation.,00:07:03.370,00:07:06.030
"Oops, I shouldn't have
erased that.",00:07:06.030,00:07:08.180
"OK, so we're going to use the
same formula that we just",00:07:08.180,00:07:10.790
"used, which is the expectation
of x given y is equal to 2.",00:07:10.790,00:07:16.330
"Sorry, x squared minus the
expectation of x conditioned",00:07:16.330,00:07:21.090
"on y is equal to
2, all squared.",00:07:21.090,00:07:24.040
"So conditioned on y
is equal to 2, the",00:07:24.040,00:07:26.470
expectation of x is 3.,00:07:26.470,00:07:28.350
Same center of mass argument.,00:07:28.350,00:07:30.630
So 3 squared is 9.,00:07:30.630,00:07:33.150
"And then x squared can
take on a value of 4.",00:07:33.150,00:07:38.370
"Or it can take on
a value of 16.",00:07:38.370,00:07:40.870
"And it does so with
equal probability.",00:07:40.870,00:07:43.280
"So we get 4/2, 4
plus 16 over 2.",00:07:43.280,00:07:51.200
"So this is 2 plus 8, which
is 10, minus 9.",00:07:51.200,00:07:55.620
That'll give us 1.,00:07:55.620,00:07:56.630
"So we get a 1 when
y is equal to 2.",00:07:56.630,00:08:00.710
"And last computation and
then we're done.",00:08:00.710,00:08:03.120
"I'm still recycling
the same formula.",00:08:03.120,00:08:06.070
"But now we're conditioning
on y is equal to 3.",00:08:06.070,00:08:11.000
"And then we'll be done with
this problem, I promise.",00:08:11.000,00:08:14.610
"OK, so when y is equal to 3 x
can take on the value of 0.",00:08:14.610,00:08:18.620
"Or it can take on
the value of 4.",00:08:18.620,00:08:20.710
"Those two points happen with
probability 1/2, 1/2.",00:08:20.710,00:08:24.110
"So the expectation is right
in the middle which is 2.",00:08:24.110,00:08:27.790
So we get a minus 4.,00:08:27.790,00:08:30.210
"And similarly, x squared can
take on the value of 0.",00:08:30.210,00:08:34.460
"When x takes on the value of
0-- and that happens with",00:08:34.460,00:08:36.830
probability 1/2--,00:08:36.830,00:08:38.530
"similarly, x squared can take
on the value of 16 when x",00:08:38.530,00:08:41.735
takes on the value of 4.,00:08:41.735,00:08:42.929
"And that happens with
probability 1/2.",00:08:42.929,00:08:45.400
"So we just have 0/2
plus 16/2 minus 4.",00:08:45.400,00:08:51.540
"And this gives us 8 minus
4, which is simply 4.",00:08:51.540,00:08:55.752
"So finally, after all that
computation, we are done.",00:08:55.752,00:08:59.540
"We have the conditional
variance of x given y.",00:08:59.540,00:09:03.010
"Again, we're interested in when
this value is largest.",00:09:03.010,00:09:07.070
"And we see that 4 is the biggest
value in this column.",00:09:07.070,00:09:11.495
"And this value occurs when
y takes on a value of 3.",00:09:11.495,00:09:15.840
"So our answer, over here,
is y is equal to 3.",00:09:15.840,00:09:22.420
"All right, so now we're going to
switch gears in part c and",00:09:22.420,00:09:25.200
d a little bit.,00:09:25.200,00:09:27.680
"And we're going to
be more concerned",00:09:27.680,00:09:29.660
"with PMFs, et cetera.",00:09:29.660,00:09:32.930
"So in part c, we're given a
random variable called r which",00:09:32.930,00:09:37.840
"is defined as the minimum
of x and y.",00:09:37.840,00:09:41.250
"So for instance, this
is the 0.01.",00:09:41.250,00:09:43.970
The minimum of 0 and 1 is 0.,00:09:43.970,00:09:45.710
"So r would have a
value of 0 here.",00:09:45.710,00:09:50.180
"Now, we can be a little bit
smarter about this.",00:09:50.180,00:09:52.250
"If we plot the line,
y is equal to x.",00:09:52.250,00:09:56.250
"So that looks something
like this.",00:09:56.250,00:09:57.855
 ,00:09:57.855,00:10:00.360
"We see that all of the points
below this line satisfy y",00:10:00.360,00:10:06.780
being less or equal to x.,00:10:06.780,00:10:08.920
"And all the points above this
line have y greater than or",00:10:08.920,00:10:12.640
equal to x.,00:10:12.640,00:10:14.290
"So if y is less than or equal to
x, you hopefully agree that",00:10:14.290,00:10:18.332
"here the min, or r,
is equal to y.",00:10:18.332,00:10:21.660
"But over here, the min, r, is
actually equal to x, since x",00:10:21.660,00:10:26.510
is always smaller.,00:10:26.510,00:10:27.440
"So now we can go
ahead quickly.",00:10:27.440,00:10:28.890
"And I'm going to write the value
of r next each point",00:10:28.890,00:10:31.760
using this rule.,00:10:31.760,00:10:33.190
"So here, r is the value
of y, which is 1.",00:10:33.190,00:10:36.960
"Here, r is equal to 0.",00:10:36.960,00:10:39.270
Here r is 1.,00:10:39.270,00:10:40.410
Here r is 2.,00:10:40.410,00:10:42.200
Here r is 3.,00:10:42.200,00:10:44.650
"Over here, r is the
value of x.",00:10:44.650,00:10:46.600
So r is equal to 0.,00:10:46.600,00:10:48.980
And r is equal to 0 here.,00:10:48.980,00:10:50.620
"And so the only point we didn't
handle is the one that",00:10:50.620,00:10:53.000
lies on the line.,00:10:53.000,00:10:54.120
But in that case it's easy.,00:10:54.120,00:10:55.750
Because x is equal to 2.,00:10:55.750,00:10:57.250
And y is equal to 2.,00:10:57.250,00:10:59.100
So the min is simply 2.,00:10:59.100,00:11:01.590
"So with this information
I claim we're now done.",00:11:01.590,00:11:05.040
"We can just write down
what the PMF of r is.",00:11:05.040,00:11:08.690
"So in particular, r takes
on a value of 0.",00:11:08.690,00:11:15.225
 ,00:11:15.225,00:11:17.820
"When this point happens,
this point happens,",00:11:17.820,00:11:20.200
or this point happens.,00:11:20.200,00:11:21.820
And those collectively have a,00:11:21.820,00:11:22.990
probability of 3/8 of occurring.,00:11:22.990,00:11:27.170
"r can take on a value of 1
when either of these two",00:11:27.170,00:11:30.420
points happen.,00:11:30.420,00:11:32.120
"So that happens with
probability 2/8.",00:11:32.120,00:11:33.830
 ,00:11:33.830,00:11:36.960
r is equal to 2.,00:11:36.960,00:11:38.540
This can happen in two ways.,00:11:38.540,00:11:40.030
So we get 2/8.,00:11:40.030,00:11:42.450
"And r equal to 3 can happen
in only one way.",00:11:42.450,00:11:45.740
So we get 1/8.,00:11:45.740,00:11:48.170
"Quick sanity check, 3 plus
2 is 5, plus 2 is",00:11:48.170,00:11:51.710
"7, plus 1 is 8.",00:11:51.710,00:11:52.920
So our PMF sums to 1.,00:11:52.920,00:11:55.230
"And to be complete, we
should sketch it.",00:11:55.230,00:11:57.120
"Because the problem asks
us to sketch it.",00:11:57.120,00:12:00.220
"So we're plotting PR
of r, 0, 1, 2, 3.",00:12:00.220,00:12:07.760
"So here we get, let's
see, 1, 2, 3.",00:12:07.760,00:12:11.575
For 0 we have 3/8.,00:12:11.575,00:12:14.490
For 1 we have 2/8.,00:12:14.490,00:12:17.870
For 2 we have 2/8.,00:12:17.870,00:12:20.880
And for 3 we have 1/8.,00:12:20.880,00:12:24.530
"So this is our fully labeled
sketch of Pr of r.",00:12:24.530,00:12:30.090
"And forgive me for erasing so
quickly, but you guys can",00:12:30.090,00:12:34.210
"pause the video, presumably,
if you need more time.",00:12:34.210,00:12:38.280
Let's move on to part d.,00:12:38.280,00:12:40.160
"So in part d we're given an
event named a, which is the",00:12:40.160,00:12:43.590
"event that x squared is greater
than or equal to y.",00:12:43.590,00:12:46.890
"And then we're asked to find the
expectation of xy in the",00:12:46.890,00:12:50.240
unconditional universe.,00:12:50.240,00:12:51.860
"And then the expectation of x
times y conditioned on a.",00:12:51.860,00:12:56.240
"So let's not worry about the
conditioning for now.",00:12:56.240,00:12:58.320
"Let's just focus on
the unconditional",00:12:58.320,00:13:01.090
expectation of x times y.,00:13:01.090,00:13:03.040
"So I'm just going to
erase all these r's",00:13:03.040,00:13:04.630
so I don't get confused.,00:13:04.630,00:13:07.130
"But we're going to follow a very
similar strategy, which",00:13:07.130,00:13:12.910
"is at each point I'm going to
label what the value of w is.",00:13:12.910,00:13:17.770
"And we'll find the expectation
of w that way.",00:13:17.770,00:13:22.840
"So let's see, here,
we have 4 times 0.",00:13:22.840,00:13:27.130
So w is equal to 0.,00:13:27.130,00:13:29.050
Here we have 4 times 1.,00:13:29.050,00:13:30.440
w is equal to 4.,00:13:30.440,00:13:32.340
"4 times 2, w is equal to 8.",00:13:32.340,00:13:34.530
"4 times 3, w is equal to 12.",00:13:34.530,00:13:37.882
w is equal to 2.,00:13:37.882,00:13:39.730
w is equal to 4.,00:13:39.730,00:13:41.980
w is equal to 0.,00:13:41.980,00:13:43.610
w is equal to 0.,00:13:43.610,00:13:45.430
"OK, so that was just algebra.",00:13:45.430,00:13:47.610
"And now, I claim again, we can
just write down what the",00:13:47.610,00:13:51.050
expectation of x times y is.,00:13:51.050,00:13:54.450
"And I'm sorry, I didn't
announce my notation.",00:13:54.450,00:13:57.550
I should mention that now.,00:13:57.550,00:14:00.560
"I was defining w to be the
random variable x times y.",00:14:00.560,00:14:04.640
"And that's why I labeled
the product of x",00:14:04.640,00:14:06.910
times y as w over here.,00:14:06.910,00:14:10.760
"My apologies about not defining
that random variable.",00:14:10.760,00:14:15.330
"So the expectation of w, well,
w takes on a value of 0.",00:14:15.330,00:14:21.210
"When this happens, this happens
or that happens.",00:14:21.210,00:14:23.680
"And we know that those
three points occur",00:14:23.680,00:14:28.920
with probability 3/8.,00:14:28.920,00:14:31.260
So we have 0 times 3/8.,00:14:31.260,00:14:35.100
"I'm just using the normal
formula for expectation.",00:14:35.100,00:14:38.080
"w takes on a value of 2
with probability 1/8.",00:14:38.080,00:14:40.815
"Because this is the lead
point in which it",00:14:40.815,00:14:43.590
"happens, 2 times 1/8.",00:14:43.590,00:14:46.220
"Plus it can take on the value
of 4 with probability",00:14:46.220,00:14:50.770
"2/8, 4 times 2/8.",00:14:50.770,00:14:54.260
"And 8, with 1/8 probability.",00:14:54.260,00:14:58.150
"And similarly, 12 with
1/8 probability.",00:14:58.150,00:15:01.740
So this is just algebra.,00:15:01.740,00:15:03.150
The numerator sums up to 30.,00:15:03.150,00:15:06.674
"Yes, that's correct.",00:15:06.674,00:15:08.445
"So we have 30/8, which
is equal to 15/4.",00:15:08.445,00:15:13.920
"So this is our first
answer for part d.",00:15:13.920,00:15:18.390
"And now we have to do this
slightly trickier one, which",00:15:18.390,00:15:20.610
"is the conditional expectation
of x times y, or w",00:15:20.610,00:15:24.290
conditioned on a.,00:15:24.290,00:15:26.110
"So similar to what I did in part
c, I'm going to draw the",00:15:26.110,00:15:31.360
line y equals x squared.,00:15:31.360,00:15:34.510
"So y equals x squared
is 0 here, 1 here.",00:15:34.510,00:15:37.870
"And at 2, it should take
on a value of 4.",00:15:37.870,00:15:41.070
"So the curve should look
something like this.",00:15:41.070,00:15:45.760
"This is the line y is
equal to x squared.",00:15:45.760,00:15:48.470
"So we know all the points below
this line satisfy y less",00:15:48.470,00:15:52.410
than or equal to x squared.,00:15:52.410,00:15:54.230
"And all the points above this
line have y greater than or",00:15:54.230,00:15:57.130
equal to x squared.,00:15:57.130,00:15:59.170
"And a is y less than or
equal to x squared.",00:15:59.170,00:16:02.870
"So we are in the conditional
universe where only points",00:16:02.870,00:16:07.090
below this line can happen.,00:16:07.090,00:16:09.390
"So that one, that one, that
one, that one, that",00:16:09.390,00:16:11.240
one and that one.,00:16:11.240,00:16:12.190
So there are six of them.,00:16:12.190,00:16:13.790
"And again, in the unconditional
world, all of",00:16:13.790,00:16:15.930
"the points were equally
likely.",00:16:15.930,00:16:17.190
"So in the conditional world
these six points are still",00:16:17.190,00:16:20.040
equally likely.,00:16:20.040,00:16:21.040
"So they each happen with
probability 1/6.",00:16:21.040,00:16:24.630
"So in this case, the expectation
of w is simply 2",00:16:24.630,00:16:33.310
times 1/6 plus 0 times 1/6.,00:16:33.310,00:16:38.050
But that's 0.,00:16:38.050,00:16:38.930
So I'm not going to write it.,00:16:38.930,00:16:41.260
"4 times 2/6 plus 4 times 2/6
plus 8 times 1/6, plus 12",00:16:41.260,00:16:52.250
times 1 over 6.,00:16:52.250,00:16:54.820
"And again, the numerator
summed to 30.",00:16:54.820,00:16:56.650
"But this time our denominator
is 6.",00:16:56.650,00:16:58.780
So this is simply 5.,00:16:58.780,00:17:01.210
"So we have, actually, finished
the problem.",00:17:01.210,00:17:04.230
"Because we've computed this
value and this value.",00:17:04.230,00:17:07.940
"And so the important takeaways
of this problem are,",00:17:07.940,00:17:12.369
"essentially, honestly, just to
get you comfortable with",00:17:12.369,00:17:16.089
"computing things involving
joint PMFs.",00:17:16.089,00:17:19.410
"We talked a lot about finding
expectations quickly by",00:17:19.410,00:17:23.109
"thinking about center
of mass and the",00:17:23.109,00:17:25.180
geometry of the problem.,00:17:25.180,00:17:27.030
"We've got practice computing
conditional variances.",00:17:27.030,00:17:31.461
"And we did some derived
distributions.",00:17:31.461,00:17:34.330
"And we'll do a lot more
of those later.",00:17:34.330,00:17:36.170
 ,00:17:36.170,00:17:37.420
