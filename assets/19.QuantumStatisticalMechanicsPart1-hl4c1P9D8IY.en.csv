"PROFESSOR: Begin
with a new topic,",00:00:22.410,00:00:24.010
"which is breakdown of classical
statistical mechanics.",00:00:24.010,00:00:28.260
"So we developed a formalism
to probabilistically describe",00:00:43.750,00:00:47.990
collections of large particles.,00:00:47.990,00:00:50.590
"And once we have that, from that
formalism calculate properties",00:00:50.590,00:00:56.560
"of matter that have to do
with heat, temperature,",00:00:56.560,00:01:00.060
"et cetera, and things
coming to equilibrium.",00:01:00.060,00:01:02.210
"So question is, is this
formalism always successful?",00:01:05.870,00:01:14.190
"And by the time you come to
the end of the 19th Century,",00:01:14.190,00:01:21.110
"there were several things
that were hanging around that",00:01:21.110,00:01:25.240
"had to do with thermal
properties of the matter",00:01:25.240,00:01:28.090
"where this formalism
was having difficulties.",00:01:28.090,00:01:33.810
"And the difficulties
ultimately pointed out",00:01:33.810,00:01:36.500
"to emergence of
quantum mechanics.",00:01:36.500,00:01:39.220
"So essentially, understanding
the relationship",00:01:39.220,00:01:42.210
"between thermodynamics,
statistical mechanics,",00:01:42.210,00:01:46.030
"and properties of matter was
very important to development",00:01:46.030,00:01:50.700
of quantum mechanics.,00:01:50.700,00:01:52.020
"And in particular, I will
mention three difficulties.",00:01:52.020,00:01:58.180
"The most important one
that really originally set",00:01:58.180,00:02:03.820
"the first stone for
quantum mechanics",00:02:03.820,00:02:06.490
"is the spectrum of
black body radiation.",00:02:06.490,00:02:08.834
"And it's basically
the observation",00:02:21.010,00:02:23.320
that you heat something.,00:02:23.320,00:02:25.840
"And when it becomes hot,
it starts to radiate.",00:02:25.840,00:02:30.110
"And typically, the color of
the radiation that you get",00:02:30.110,00:02:34.720
"is a function of
temperature, but does not",00:02:34.720,00:02:36.960
"depend on the properties of the
material that you are heating.",00:02:36.960,00:02:40.850
So that has to do with heat.,00:02:40.850,00:02:43.020
"And you should be
able to explain",00:02:43.020,00:02:45.770
"that using
statistical mechanics.",00:02:45.770,00:02:50.570
"Another thing that we
have already mentioned",00:02:50.570,00:02:53.650
"has to do with the third
law of thermodynamics.",00:02:53.650,00:02:57.450
"And let's say the heat capacity
of materials such as solids.",00:02:57.450,00:03:04.270
"We mentioned this
Nernst theorem that",00:03:08.960,00:03:14.780
"was the third law
of thermodynamics",00:03:14.780,00:03:20.160
based on observation.,00:03:20.160,00:03:22.200
"Consequence of it was that
heat capacity of most things",00:03:22.200,00:03:26.150
"that you can measure go to 0
as you go to 0 temperature.",00:03:26.150,00:03:31.650
"We should be able to
explain that again,",00:03:31.650,00:03:33.770
"based on the phenomena of
statistical-- the phenomenology",00:03:33.770,00:03:39.040
"of thermodynamics and the
rules of statistical mechanics.",00:03:39.040,00:03:44.830
"Now, a third thing that
is less often mentioned",00:03:44.830,00:03:47.400
"but is also important has
to do with heat capacity",00:03:47.400,00:03:54.910
"of the atomic gases such as
the air in this room, which",00:03:54.910,00:04:06.380
"is composed of, say,
oxygen and nitrogen that",00:04:06.380,00:04:09.260
are diatomic gases.,00:04:09.260,00:04:12.620
"So probably, historically they
were answered and discussed",00:04:12.620,00:04:20.754
"and resolving the order
that I have drawn for you.",00:04:20.754,00:04:25.570
But I will go backwards.,00:04:25.570,00:04:27.480
"so we will first
talk about this one,",00:04:27.480,00:04:30.590
"then about number two--
heat capacity of solids--",00:04:30.590,00:04:35.070
"and number three about
black body radiation.",00:04:35.070,00:04:39.500
OK.,00:04:39.500,00:04:41.650
"Part of the reason is that
throughout the course,",00:04:41.650,00:04:45.520
"we have been using our
understanding of the gas",00:04:45.520,00:04:49.230
"as the sort of measure
of how well we understand",00:04:49.230,00:04:55.420
"thermal properties
of the matter.",00:04:55.420,00:04:57.870
"And so let's stick with
the gas and ask, what do I",00:04:57.870,00:05:02.230
"know about the heat capacity
of the gas in this room?",00:05:02.230,00:05:06.520
"So let's think
about heat capacity",00:05:06.520,00:05:11.497
of dilute diatomic gas.,00:05:11.497,00:05:16.495
"It is a gas that is sufficiently
dilute that it is practically",00:05:22.290,00:05:28.440
having ideal gas law.,00:05:28.440,00:05:30.290
"So PV is roughly
proportional to temperature.",00:05:30.290,00:05:34.720
"But rather than thinking
about its pressure,",00:05:34.720,00:05:37.160
"I want to make sure I
understand something",00:05:37.160,00:05:39.040
"about the heat capacity, another
quantity that I can measure.",00:05:39.040,00:05:42.810
So what's going on here?,00:05:42.810,00:05:44.270
"I have, let's say, a box.",00:05:44.270,00:05:46.990
"And within this box,
we have a whole bunch",00:05:46.990,00:05:49.640
of these diatomic molecules.,00:05:49.640,00:05:51.910
"Let's stick to the
canonical ensemble.",00:05:56.140,00:06:01.910
"So I tell you the volume
of this gas, the number",00:06:01.910,00:06:05.660
"of diatomic molecules,
and the temperature.",00:06:05.660,00:06:07.690
"And in this formalism, I
would calculate the partition",00:06:10.380,00:06:16.260
function.,00:06:16.260,00:06:16.780
"Out of that, I should
be able to calculate",00:06:16.780,00:06:18.800
"the energy, heat
capacity, et cetera.",00:06:18.800,00:06:22.220
So what do I have to do?,00:06:22.220,00:06:24.470
"I have to integrate over all
possible coordinates that",00:06:24.470,00:06:30.980
occur in this system.,00:06:30.980,00:06:33.340
"To all intents and purposes,
the different molecules",00:06:33.340,00:06:37.060
are identical.,00:06:37.060,00:06:38.890
"So I divide by the
phase space that",00:06:38.890,00:06:42.840
is assigned to each one of them.,00:06:42.840,00:06:45.930
"And I said it is dilute
enough that for all intents",00:06:45.930,00:06:51.210
"and purposes, the pressure is
proportional to temperature.",00:06:51.210,00:06:55.880
"And that occur, I
know, when I can",00:06:55.880,00:06:58.420
"ignore the interactions
between particles.",00:06:58.420,00:07:01.720
"So if I can ignore the
interactions between particles,",00:07:01.720,00:07:05.490
"then the partition function
for the entire system",00:07:05.490,00:07:08.450
"would be the product of
the partition functions",00:07:08.450,00:07:10.820
"that I would write for
the individual molecules,",00:07:10.820,00:07:13.970
"or one of them raised
to the N power.",00:07:13.970,00:07:16.270
"So what's the Z1 that
I have to calculate?",00:07:16.270,00:07:20.230
"Z1 is obtained by
integrating over",00:07:20.230,00:07:23.880
"the coordinates and momenta
of a single diatomic particle.",00:07:23.880,00:07:28.270
So I have a factor of d cubed p.,00:07:28.270,00:07:30.530
I have a factor of d cubed q.,00:07:30.530,00:07:33.600
"But I have two particles, so
I have d cubed p1, d cubed q1,",00:07:33.600,00:07:38.480
"d cubed p2, d cubed
q 2, and I have",00:07:38.480,00:07:43.850
six pairs of coordinate momenta.,00:07:43.850,00:07:48.170
So I divide it by h cubed.,00:07:48.170,00:07:50.800
"I have e to the minus beta
times the energy of this system,",00:07:50.800,00:07:57.820
"which is p1 squared over
2m p2 squared over 2m.",00:07:57.820,00:08:04.230
"And some potential
of interaction",00:08:04.230,00:08:08.160
"that is responsible for bringing
and binding these things",00:08:08.160,00:08:12.220
together.,00:08:12.220,00:08:13.720
"So there is some V that
is function of q1 and q2",00:08:13.720,00:08:18.110
"that binds the two particles
together and does not",00:08:18.110,00:08:21.760
allow them to become separate.,00:08:21.760,00:08:24.290
"All right, so what
do we do here?",00:08:24.290,00:08:26.810
"We realize that immediately for
one of these particle,s there",00:08:26.810,00:08:30.275
"is a center of mass that
can go all over the place.",00:08:30.275,00:08:34.039
"So we change
coordinates to, let's",00:08:34.039,00:08:36.750
"say, Q, which is
q1 plus q2 over 2.",00:08:36.750,00:08:42.049
"And corresponding to the
center of mass position,",00:08:42.049,00:08:45.910
"there is also a center
of mass momentum, P,",00:08:45.910,00:08:51.660
which is related to p1 minus p2.,00:08:51.660,00:08:59.320
"But when I make the change
of variables from these",00:08:59.320,00:09:03.430
"coordinates to these
coordinates, what I will get",00:09:03.430,00:09:06.840
"is that I will have
a simple integral",00:09:06.840,00:09:10.450
over the relative coordinates.,00:09:10.450,00:09:12.380
"So I have d cubed Q d
cubed big P h cubed.",00:09:12.380,00:09:17.230
"And the only thing that
I have over there is",00:09:17.230,00:09:20.580
"e to the minus beta p squared
divided by 2 big M. Big M",00:09:20.580,00:09:27.640
"being the sum total
of the two masses.",00:09:27.640,00:09:30.430
"If the two masses are
identical, it would be 2M.",00:09:30.430,00:09:33.670
"Otherwise, it would
be M1 plus M2.",00:09:33.670,00:09:36.316
"And then I have an integration
over the relative coordinate.",00:09:36.316,00:09:42.040
"Let's call that q
relative momentum p",00:09:42.040,00:09:46.642
"h cubed e to the minus
beta p squared over 2 times",00:09:46.642,00:09:52.330
the reduced mass here.,00:09:52.330,00:09:56.000
"And then, the
potential which only",00:09:56.000,00:09:59.280
"is a function of the
relative coordinate.",00:09:59.280,00:10:01.250
"Point is that what I have done
is I have separated out this 6",00:10:06.470,00:10:12.070
"degrees of freedom that
make up-- or actually,",00:10:12.070,00:10:15.270
"the 3 degrees of freedom and
their conjugate momenta that",00:10:15.270,00:10:18.850
"make up a single molecule into
some degrees of freedom that",00:10:18.850,00:10:23.650
"correspond to the center of
mass and some degrees of freedom",00:10:23.650,00:10:27.210
"that correspond to
the relative motion.",00:10:27.210,00:10:29.910
"Furthermore, for
the relative motion",00:10:29.910,00:10:31.870
"I expect that the
form of this potential",00:10:31.870,00:10:34.240
"as a function of the separation
has a form that is a minimum.",00:10:34.240,00:10:43.980
"Basically, the particles
at 0 temperature",00:10:43.980,00:10:48.270
"would be sitting
where this minimum is.",00:10:48.270,00:10:52.110
"So essentially, the shape
of this diatomic molecule",00:10:52.110,00:10:55.900
"would be something like this
if I find its minimum energy",00:10:55.900,00:11:00.580
configuration.,00:11:00.580,00:11:03.270
"But then, I can allow
it to move with respect",00:11:03.270,00:11:08.940
"to, say, the minimum energy.",00:11:08.940,00:11:11.130
"Let's say it occurs
at some distance d.",00:11:11.130,00:11:13.590
"It can oscillate around
this minimum value.",00:11:16.350,00:11:20.560
"If it oscillates around
this minimum value,",00:11:20.560,00:11:22.800
"it basically will explore
the bottom of this potential.",00:11:22.800,00:11:28.100
"So I can basically think of
this center of mass contribution",00:11:28.100,00:11:35.350
to the partition function.,00:11:35.350,00:11:37.220
"And this contribution
has a part that",00:11:37.220,00:11:41.440
"comes from these oscillations
around the center of mass.",00:11:41.440,00:11:46.390
Let's call that u.,00:11:46.390,00:11:51.150
"Then, there is the
corresponding momentum.",00:11:51.150,00:11:53.430
"I don't know, let's call it pi.",00:11:53.430,00:11:56.220
"I divide by h and I
have e to the minus beta",00:11:56.220,00:12:02.490
pi squared over 2 mu.,00:12:02.490,00:12:06.070
And then I have minus beta.,00:12:06.070,00:12:10.000
"Well, to the lowest
order, I have",00:12:10.000,00:12:11.900
"v of d, which is a constant.",00:12:11.900,00:12:14.650
"And then I have some
frequency, some curvature",00:12:14.650,00:12:22.170
"at the bottom of
this potential that I",00:12:22.170,00:12:23.890
"choose to write as
mu omega squared",00:12:23.890,00:12:26.660
over 2 multiplying by u squared.,00:12:26.660,00:12:30.160
"Essentially, what
I want to do is",00:12:30.160,00:12:32.800
"to say that really, there is a
vibrational degree of freedom",00:12:32.800,00:12:38.120
"and there is a harmonic
oscillator that describes that.",00:12:38.120,00:12:41.480
"The frequency of that is
related to the curvature",00:12:41.480,00:12:44.117
"that I have at the
bottom of this potential.",00:12:44.117,00:12:45.950
"So this degree of freedom
corresponds to vibrations.",00:12:49.530,00:12:52.700
"But that's not the end of this
story because here I had three",00:12:59.590,00:13:05.490
q's.,00:13:05.490,00:13:06.910
"One of them became the
amplitude of this oscillation.",00:13:06.910,00:13:10.000
"So basically, the relative
coordinate is a vector.",00:13:10.000,00:13:16.240
"One degree of freedom
corresponds to stretching,",00:13:16.240,00:13:19.730
"but there are two
other components of it.",00:13:19.730,00:13:22.800
"those two other
components correspond",00:13:22.800,00:13:24.830
"to essentially keeping
the length of this fixed",00:13:24.830,00:13:28.320
"but moving in the
other directions.",00:13:28.320,00:13:31.340
What do they correspond to?,00:13:31.340,00:13:32.470
They correspond to rotations.,00:13:32.470,00:13:34.790
"So then there is essentially
another partition function",00:13:34.790,00:13:38.280
that I want right here.,00:13:38.280,00:13:39.920
"That corresponds to the
rotational degrees of freedom.",00:13:39.920,00:13:43.334
"Now, the rotational
degrees of freedom",00:13:46.020,00:13:49.640
"have a momentum contribution
because this p is also",00:13:49.640,00:13:54.500
three components.,00:13:54.500,00:13:55.960
"One component went
in to the vibrations.",00:13:55.960,00:13:58.850
"There are two more
components that",00:13:58.850,00:14:01.360
"really combine to tell
you about the angular",00:14:01.360,00:14:04.620
"momentum and the energy that
is proportional to the square",00:14:04.620,00:14:08.200
of the angular momentum.,00:14:08.200,00:14:09.750
"But there is no
restoring force for them.",00:14:09.750,00:14:12.090
"There is no corresponding
term that is like this.",00:14:12.090,00:14:15.120
"So maybe I will just write
that as an integral over angles",00:14:15.120,00:14:20.090
that I can rotate this thing.,00:14:20.090,00:14:22.270
"An integral over
the two components",00:14:22.270,00:14:24.860
"of the angular momentum
divided by h squared.",00:14:24.860,00:14:28.610
There's actually two angles.,00:14:28.610,00:14:31.050
"And the contribution is e
to the minus beta angular",00:14:31.050,00:14:35.970
momentum squared over 2I.,00:14:35.970,00:14:39.350
So I wrote the entire thing.,00:14:39.350,00:14:42.990
"So essentially,
all I have done is",00:14:42.990,00:14:49.550
"I have taken the
Hamiltonian that",00:14:49.550,00:14:53.060
"corresponds to
two particles that",00:14:53.060,00:14:55.070
"are bound together and
broken it into three pieces",00:14:55.070,00:14:59.460
"corresponding to the center
of mass, to the vibrations,",00:14:59.460,00:15:03.640
and to the rotations.,00:15:03.640,00:15:04.515
"Now, the thing is
that if I now ask,",00:15:08.300,00:15:12.920
"what is the energy that I would
get for this one particle--",00:15:12.920,00:15:18.500
"I guess I'll call this Z1-- what
is the contribution of the one",00:15:18.500,00:15:24.660
"particular to the energy
of the entire system?",00:15:24.660,00:15:29.440
"I have minus the log Z1
with respect to beta.",00:15:29.440,00:15:34.380
"That's the usual formula
to calculate energies.",00:15:34.380,00:15:37.610
"So I go and look at
this entire thing.",00:15:40.170,00:15:44.360
"And where do the beta
dependencies come from?",00:15:44.360,00:15:48.070
"Well, let's see.",00:15:48.070,00:15:49.280
"So my Z1 has a part that comes
from this center of mass.",00:15:49.280,00:16:00.220
It gives me a V. We expect that.,00:16:00.220,00:16:05.720
"And then from the
integration over the momenta,",00:16:05.720,00:16:09.570
"I will get something like 2 pi
m over beta h squared to the 3/2",00:16:09.570,00:16:20.821
power.,00:16:20.821,00:16:21.321
"From the vibrations--
OK, what do I have?",00:16:25.090,00:16:31.200
"I have e to the minus beta V
of d, which is the constant.",00:16:31.200,00:16:36.340
We really don't care.,00:16:36.340,00:16:39.570
"But there are these
two components",00:16:39.570,00:16:43.240
"that give me root 2
pi mu divided by beta.",00:16:43.240,00:16:52.775
"There is a
corresponding thing that",00:16:57.960,00:17:02.910
"comes from the variance that
goes with this object, which",00:17:02.910,00:17:06.990
"is square root of 2 pi divided
by beta mu omega squared.",00:17:06.990,00:17:16.119
"The entire thing
has a factor of 1/h.",00:17:16.119,00:17:18.225
So this is the vibrations.,00:17:22.483,00:17:23.566
"And for the rotations,
what do I get?",00:17:26.930,00:17:29.570
"I will get a 4 pi
from integrating",00:17:29.570,00:17:33.780
over all orientations.,00:17:33.780,00:17:37.200
Divided by h squared.,00:17:37.200,00:17:40.300
"I have essentially the two
components of angular momentum.",00:17:40.300,00:17:46.970
"So I get essentially, the square
of 2 pi I divided by beta.",00:17:46.970,00:17:55.806
So this is rotations.,00:17:58.602,00:18:03.240
And this is center of mass.,00:18:03.240,00:18:05.220
"We can see that if
I take that formula,",00:18:12.010,00:18:14.520
"take its log divide by-- take
a derivative with respect",00:18:14.520,00:18:22.410
to beta.,00:18:22.410,00:18:23.710
"First of all, I will
get this constant",00:18:23.710,00:18:26.360
"that is the energy of the
bond state at 0 temperature.",00:18:26.360,00:18:30.030
"But the more interesting
things are the things",00:18:30.030,00:18:32.630
"that I take from the derivatives
of the various factors of beta.",00:18:32.630,00:18:38.060
"Essentially, for each factor
of beta in the denominator,",00:18:38.060,00:18:41.470
"log Z will have a
minus log of beta.",00:18:41.470,00:18:44.550
"I take a derivative, I will
get a factor of 1 over beta.",00:18:44.550,00:18:48.850
"So from here, I will get 3/2
1 over beta, which is 3/2 kT.",00:18:48.850,00:18:55.410
So this is the center of mass.,00:18:55.410,00:18:56.905
"From here, I have two
factors of beta to the 1/2.",00:19:02.770,00:19:09.180
"So they combine to give
me one factor of kT.",00:19:09.180,00:19:12.990
This is for vibrations.,00:19:12.990,00:19:13.960
"And similarly, I have
two factors of beta",00:19:17.850,00:19:21.360
"to the 1/2, which correspond
to 1 kT for rotations.",00:19:21.360,00:19:28.790
"So then I say that the heat
capacity at constant volume",00:19:35.660,00:19:40.440
"is simply-- per particle
is related to d e1 by dT.",00:19:40.440,00:19:46.710
"And I see that that amounts
to kb times 3/2 plus 1 plus 1,",00:19:46.710,00:19:54.960
or I should get 7/2 kb.,00:19:54.960,00:19:59.160
"Per particle, which says that
if you go and calculate the heat",00:19:59.160,00:20:05.350
"capacity of the
gas in this room,",00:20:05.350,00:20:09.440
"divide by the
number of molecules",00:20:09.440,00:20:11.430
"that we have-- doesn't
matter whether they",00:20:11.430,00:20:14.980
are oxygens or nitrogen.,00:20:14.980,00:20:16.410
"They would basically give
the same contribution",00:20:16.410,00:20:18.890
"because you can see
that the masses and all",00:20:18.890,00:20:21.070
"the other properties
of the molecule",00:20:21.070,00:20:25.020
"do not appear in
the heat capacity.",00:20:25.020,00:20:27.890
"That as a function
of temperature,",00:20:27.890,00:20:32.080
I should get a value of 7/2.,00:20:32.080,00:20:35.730
"So basically, C in units of kb.",00:20:35.730,00:20:38.890
So I divide by kb.,00:20:38.890,00:20:40.140
"And my predictions is
that I should see 7/2.",00:20:40.140,00:20:42.970
"So you go and do a measurement
and what do you get?",00:20:49.030,00:20:53.680
What you get is actually 5/2.,00:20:53.680,00:20:55.240
So something is not quite right.,00:21:02.720,00:21:07.000
"We are not getting the
7/2 that we predicted.",00:21:07.000,00:21:11.700
"Except that I really
mentioned that you",00:21:11.700,00:21:13.400
"are getting this measurement
when you do measurements",00:21:13.400,00:21:18.500
"at room temperature,
you get this value.",00:21:18.500,00:21:21.190
"So when we measure
the heat capacity",00:21:21.190,00:21:23.720
"of the gas in this
room, we will get 5/2.",00:21:23.720,00:21:27.110
"But if we heat it
up, by the time",00:21:27.110,00:21:29.890
"we get to temperatures of a
few thousand degrees Kelvin.",00:21:29.890,00:21:35.420
"So if you heat the room
by a factor of 5 to 10,",00:21:35.420,00:21:39.680
"you will actually
get the value of 7/2.",00:21:39.680,00:21:45.410
"And if you cool
it, by the time you",00:21:45.410,00:21:48.100
"get to the order of
10 degrees or fewer,",00:21:48.100,00:21:53.190
"then you will find that
the heat capacity actually",00:21:53.190,00:21:57.950
goes even further.,00:21:57.950,00:21:58.910
It goes all the way to 3/2.,00:21:58.910,00:22:00.970
"And the 3/2 is
the thing that you",00:22:04.030,00:22:06.910
"would have predicted
for a gas that",00:22:06.910,00:22:09.320
"had monatomic particles,
no internal structure.",00:22:09.320,00:22:13.320
"Because then the only thing
that you would have gotten",00:22:13.320,00:22:16.340
"is the center of
mass contribution.",00:22:16.340,00:22:20.440
"So it seems like by going
to low temperatures,",00:22:20.440,00:22:25.320
"you somehow freeze
the degrees of freedom",00:22:25.320,00:22:28.580
"that correspond to vibrations
and rotations of the gas.",00:22:28.580,00:22:35.820
"And by going to really
high temperatures,",00:22:35.820,00:22:38.086
"you are able to liberate all
of these degrees of freedom",00:22:38.086,00:22:41.750
and store energy in them.,00:22:41.750,00:22:43.550
"Heat capacity is the
measure of the ability",00:22:43.550,00:22:45.920
"to store heat and energy
into these molecules.",00:22:45.920,00:22:50.905
So what is happening?,00:22:50.905,00:22:52.990
"Well, by 1905,
Planck Had already",00:22:58.370,00:23:03.020
"proposed that there is some
underlying quantization",00:23:03.020,00:23:09.010
"for heat that you have
in the black body case.",00:23:09.010,00:23:13.770
"And in 1905, Einstein
said, well, maybe we",00:23:13.770,00:23:18.250
"should think about the
vibrational degrees",00:23:18.250,00:23:22.000
"of the molecule also as
being similarly quantized.",00:23:22.000,00:23:26.360
So quantize vibrations.,00:23:26.360,00:23:32.450
"It's totally a
phenomenological statement.",00:23:36.950,00:23:39.880
We have to justify it later.,00:23:39.880,00:23:42.290
"But the statement is that for
the case where classically we",00:23:42.290,00:23:52.120
had a harmonic oscillator.,00:23:52.120,00:23:53.720
"And let's say in
this case we would",00:23:53.720,00:23:55.180
"have said that
its energy depends",00:23:55.180,00:23:58.000
"on its momentum and its
position or displacement--",00:23:58.000,00:24:03.590
"I guess I called it u--
through a formula such as this.",00:24:03.590,00:24:11.510
"Certainly, you can pick
lots of values of u and p",00:24:14.270,00:24:18.240
"that are compatible with
any value of the energy",00:24:18.240,00:24:21.430
that you choose.,00:24:21.430,00:24:24.010
"But to get the
black body spectrum",00:24:24.010,00:24:27.720
"to work, Planck had proposed
that really what you should do",00:24:27.720,00:24:33.740
"is rather than thinking of
this harmonic oscillator",00:24:33.740,00:24:37.760
"as being able to take all
possible values, that somehow",00:24:37.760,00:24:42.180
"the values of energy that
it can take are quantized.",00:24:42.180,00:24:45.710
"And furthermore, he
had proposed that they",00:24:45.710,00:24:48.180
"are proportional to
the frequency involved.",00:24:48.180,00:24:52.050
And how did he guess that?,00:24:52.050,00:24:53.930
"Ultimately, it was
related to what",00:24:53.930,00:24:55.830
"I said about black
body radiation.",00:24:55.830,00:24:58.260
"That as you heat
up the body, you",00:24:58.260,00:25:01.880
"will find that there's
a light that comes out",00:25:01.880,00:25:04.720
"and the frequency of
that light is somehow",00:25:04.720,00:25:07.190
"related to temperature
and nothing else.",00:25:07.190,00:25:10.140
"And based on that,
he had proposed",00:25:10.140,00:25:11.950
"that frequencies should come
up in certain packages that",00:25:11.950,00:25:16.715
"are proportional
to-- the energies",00:25:16.715,00:25:20.200
"of the particular frequencies
should come in packages that",00:25:20.200,00:25:23.470
"are proportional
to that frequency.",00:25:23.470,00:25:26.210
"So there is an integer
here n that tells you",00:25:26.210,00:25:30.100
"about the number
of these packets.",00:25:30.100,00:25:33.930
"And not that it really matters
for what we are doing now,",00:25:33.930,00:25:39.220
"but just to be consistent
with what we currently know",00:25:39.220,00:25:42.780
"with quantum mechanics,
let me add the 0 point",00:25:42.780,00:25:46.830
"energy of the harmonic
oscillator here.",00:25:46.830,00:25:48.590
"So then, to calculate
the contribution",00:25:51.830,00:25:55.950
"of a system in which energy
is in quantized packages,",00:25:55.950,00:26:00.270
"you would say, OK,
I will calculate",00:26:00.270,00:26:02.240
"a Z1 for these
vibrational levels,",00:26:02.240,00:26:06.720
"assuming this
quantization of energy.",00:26:06.720,00:26:10.740
"And so that says that
the possible states",00:26:10.740,00:26:14.460
"of my harmonic
oscillator have energies",00:26:14.460,00:26:18.510
"that are in these units
h bar omega n plus 1/2.",00:26:18.510,00:26:24.210
"And if I still continue to
believe statistical mechanics,",00:26:24.210,00:26:28.960
"I would say that
at a temperature t,",00:26:28.960,00:26:33.620
"the probability that I
will be in a state that",00:26:33.620,00:26:36.860
"is characterized by
integer n is e to the minus",00:26:36.860,00:26:40.550
"beta times the energy that
corresponds to that integer n.",00:26:40.550,00:26:44.570
"And then I can go and sum
over all possible energies",00:26:44.570,00:26:50.590
"and that would be
the normalization",00:26:50.590,00:26:52.925
"of the probability that
I'm in one of these states.",00:26:52.925,00:26:57.510
"So this is e to the minus
beta h bar omega over 2",00:26:57.510,00:27:04.195
"from the ground
state contribution.",00:27:04.195,00:27:09.020
"The rest of it is simply
a geometric series.",00:27:09.020,00:27:12.490
"Geometric series, we can sum
very easily to get 1 minus e",00:27:12.490,00:27:18.820
to the minus beta h bar omega.,00:27:18.820,00:27:21.780
"And the interesting thing--
or a few interesting things",00:27:21.780,00:27:28.820
"about this expression
is that if I",00:27:28.820,00:27:31.570
"evaluate this in the
limit of low temperatures.",00:27:31.570,00:27:35.261
"Well, actually, let's go
first to the high temperature",00:27:35.261,00:27:37.510
where beta goes to 0.,00:27:37.510,00:27:39.060
"So t goes to become
large, beta goes to 0.",00:27:39.060,00:27:42.940
"Numerator goes to 1, denominator
I can expand the exponential.",00:27:42.940,00:27:48.080
"And to lowest order, I will
get 1 over beta h bar omega.",00:27:48.080,00:27:52.000
"Now, compare this result
with the classical result",00:27:56.320,00:28:03.960
"that we have over here
for the vibration.",00:28:03.960,00:28:07.330
"Contribution of a harmonic
oscillator to the partition",00:28:07.330,00:28:10.440
function.,00:28:10.440,00:28:11.680
"You can see that
the mu's cancel out.",00:28:11.680,00:28:16.880
I will get 1 over beta.,00:28:16.880,00:28:21.280
I will get h divided by 2 pi.,00:28:21.280,00:28:24.950
"So if I call h divided
by 2 pi to be h bar,",00:28:24.950,00:28:29.090
"then I will get
exactly this limit.",00:28:29.090,00:28:36.370
"So somehow this constant
that we had introduced",00:28:36.370,00:28:43.250
"that had dimensions
of action made",00:28:43.250,00:28:46.420
"to make our calculations
of partition function",00:28:46.420,00:28:50.960
"to be dimensionless
will be related",00:28:50.960,00:28:54.870
"to this h bar that
quantizes the energy",00:28:54.870,00:28:58.220
"levels through the
usual formula of h being",00:28:58.220,00:29:01.480
h bar-- h bar being h over 2 pi.,00:29:01.480,00:29:05.640
"So basically, this
quantization of energy",00:29:05.640,00:29:10.920
"clearly does not affect
the high temperature limit.",00:29:10.920,00:29:14.310

high temperature",00:29:14.310,00:29:16.400

Yes?,00:29:21.920,00:29:24.670

equals h bar over 2 pi?",00:29:24.670,00:29:26.670

PROFESSOR: Thank you.,00:29:30.850,00:29:31.834
Good.,00:29:38.071,00:29:38.570
All right?,00:29:44.170,00:29:45.710
"So this is, I guess, the
corresponding formula.",00:29:45.710,00:29:48.740
"Now, when you go to low
temperature, what do you get?",00:29:52.150,00:29:54.830
"You essentially get the first
few terms in the series.",00:29:54.830,00:30:02.130
"Because at the
lowest temperature",00:30:02.130,00:30:05.710
"you get the term that
corresponds to n equals to 0,",00:30:05.710,00:30:10.460
"and then you will
get corrections",00:30:10.460,00:30:12.850
from subsequent terms.,00:30:12.850,00:30:13.910
"Now, what this does is that
it affects the heat capacity",00:30:21.090,00:30:28.350
profoundly.,00:30:28.350,00:30:29.020
So let's see how that happens.,00:30:29.020,00:30:31.180
"So the contribution of 1
degrees of freedom to the energy",00:30:31.180,00:30:36.330
"in this quantized fashion
d log Z by d beta.",00:30:36.330,00:30:44.120
"So if I just take the
log of this expression,",00:30:44.120,00:30:48.700
"log of this expression will get
this factor of minus beta h bar",00:30:48.700,00:30:52.920
omega over 2 from the numerator.,00:30:52.920,00:30:55.530
"The derivative of that will
give you this ground state",00:30:55.530,00:30:58.590
"energy, which is always there.",00:30:58.590,00:31:01.880
"And then you'll have
to take the derivative",00:31:01.880,00:31:05.570
"of the log of what
is coming out here.",00:31:05.570,00:31:08.370
"Taking a derivative
with respect to beta,",00:31:08.370,00:31:11.730
"we'll always pick out a
factor of h bar omega.",00:31:11.730,00:31:16.880
"Indeed, it will pick out
a factor of h bar omega",00:31:16.880,00:31:19.980
e to the minus beta h bar omega.,00:31:19.980,00:31:23.160
"And then in the denominator,
because I took the log,",00:31:23.160,00:31:26.880
I will get this expression back.,00:31:26.880,00:31:28.595
"So again, in this
expression, if I",00:31:36.720,00:31:40.740
"take the limit where beta
goes to 0, what do I get?",00:31:40.740,00:31:50.870
"I will get this h
bar omega over 2.",00:31:50.870,00:31:53.370
It's always there.,00:31:53.370,00:31:54.990
"Expanding these results here,
I will have a beta h bar omega.",00:31:54.990,00:31:59.750
"It will cancel this and it
will give me a 1 over beta.",00:31:59.750,00:32:03.610
"I will get this kT
that I had before.",00:32:03.610,00:32:07.830
"Indeed, if I am correct
to the right order,",00:32:07.830,00:32:12.440
"I will just simply
get 1 over beta.",00:32:12.440,00:32:16.810
"Whereas, if I go to
large beta, what I get",00:32:16.810,00:32:24.470
"is this h bar omega
over 2 plus a correction",00:32:24.470,00:32:28.710
"from here, which is h bar omega
e to the minus beta h bar.",00:32:28.710,00:32:34.446
"And that will be reflected
in the heat capacity, which",00:32:39.640,00:32:47.790
is dE by dT.,00:32:47.790,00:32:49.876
"This h bar omega over 2 does
not continue to heat capacity,",00:32:52.690,00:32:56.760
not surprisingly.,00:32:56.760,00:32:59.210
"From here, I have to take
derivatives with temperatures.",00:32:59.210,00:33:03.620
"They appear in the combination
h bar omega over kT.",00:33:03.620,00:33:07.930
"So what happens is
I will get something",00:33:07.930,00:33:10.000
"that is of the order
of h bar omega.",00:33:10.000,00:33:12.990
"And then from here, I
will get another h bar",00:33:12.990,00:33:15.500
omega divided by kb T squared.,00:33:15.500,00:33:20.290
"I will write it in this fashion
and put the kb out here.",00:33:20.290,00:33:25.900
"And then the rest
of these objects",00:33:25.900,00:33:29.510
"will give me a
contribution that is minus",00:33:29.510,00:33:32.270
"h bar omega over kT
divided by 1 minus e",00:33:32.270,00:33:37.800
"to the minus h bar
omega over kT squared.",00:33:37.800,00:33:42.760
"The important thing
is the following--",00:33:47.140,00:33:49.260
"If I plot the heat
capacity that I",00:33:52.110,00:33:54.460
"get from one of
these oscillators--",00:33:54.460,00:33:57.760
"and the natural
units of all heat",00:33:57.760,00:34:00.480
"capacities are kb, essentially.",00:34:00.480,00:34:03.770
"Energy divided by temperature,
as kb has that units.",00:34:03.770,00:34:08.860
"At high temperatures,
what I can see",00:34:08.860,00:34:12.969
"is that the energy is
proportional to kT.",00:34:12.969,00:34:17.360
"So heat capacity of the
vibrational degree of freedom",00:34:17.360,00:34:20.500
"will be in these
units going to 1.",00:34:20.500,00:34:25.870
"At low temperatures, however, it
becomes this exponentially hard",00:34:25.870,00:34:30.920
problem to create excitations.,00:34:30.920,00:34:35.210
"Because of that, you
will get a contribution",00:34:35.210,00:34:38.280
"that as T goes to 0 will
exponentially go to 0.",00:34:38.280,00:34:43.130
"So the shape of the heat
capacity that you would get",00:34:43.130,00:34:47.160
will be something like this.,00:34:47.160,00:34:49.098
"The natural way to
draw this figure",00:34:53.662,00:35:01.450
"is actually what I
made the vertical axis",00:35:01.450,00:35:05.500
to be dimensionless.,00:35:05.500,00:35:06.650
So it goes between 0 and 1.,00:35:06.650,00:35:08.970
"I can make the
horizontal axis to be",00:35:08.970,00:35:11.310
"dimensionless by introducing
a theta of vibrations,",00:35:11.310,00:35:16.180
"so that all of the exponential
terms are of the form e",00:35:16.180,00:35:21.340
"to the minus T over this
theta of vibrations, which",00:35:21.340,00:35:25.970
"means that this
theta of vibration",00:35:25.970,00:35:29.750
is h bar omega over kb.,00:35:29.750,00:35:33.130
"That is, you tell me what the
frequency of your oscillator",00:35:33.130,00:35:36.260
is.,00:35:36.260,00:35:37.260
"I can calculate the
corresponding temperature,",00:35:37.260,00:35:40.270
theta.,00:35:40.270,00:35:41.410
"And then the heat capacity
of a harmonic oscillator",00:35:41.410,00:35:45.490
"is this universal
function there, presumably",00:35:45.490,00:35:49.140
"at some value that
is of the order of 1.",00:35:49.140,00:35:53.160
"It switches from
being of the order",00:35:53.160,00:35:55.980
"of 1 to going
exponentially to 0.",00:35:55.980,00:35:58.810
"So basically, the dependence
down here to leading order",00:35:58.810,00:36:03.060
"is e to the minus T
over theta vibration.",00:36:03.060,00:36:05.404
OK.,00:36:10.250,00:36:10.750
"So you say, OK,
Planck has given us",00:36:14.020,00:36:17.750
"some estimate of what
this h bar is based",00:36:17.750,00:36:20.720
"on looking at the spectrum
of black body radiation.",00:36:20.720,00:36:25.250
"We can, more or, less
estimate the typical energies",00:36:25.250,00:36:29.450
of interactions of molecules.,00:36:29.450,00:36:31.760
"And from that, we
can estimate what",00:36:31.760,00:36:35.120
this frequency of vibration is.,00:36:35.120,00:36:37.960
"So we should be able to
get an order of magnitude",00:36:37.960,00:36:40.720
"estimate of what
this theta y is.",00:36:40.720,00:36:43.380
"And what you find is that
theta y is of the order of 10",00:36:43.380,00:36:47.350
to the 3 degrees Kelvin.,00:36:47.350,00:36:50.014
"It depends, of course, on
what gas you are looking at,",00:36:50.014,00:36:52.910
et cetera.,00:36:52.910,00:36:53.830
"But as an order of magnitude,
it is something like that.",00:36:53.830,00:36:59.140
"So we can now transport this
curve that we have over here",00:36:59.140,00:37:03.540
"and more or less get this
first part of the curve",00:37:03.540,00:37:06.680
that we have over here.,00:37:06.680,00:37:08.280
"So essentially, in this
picture what we have",00:37:08.280,00:37:11.910
is that there is no vibrations.,00:37:11.910,00:37:14.760
"The vibrations have
been frozen out.",00:37:14.760,00:37:18.212
And here you have vibrations.,00:37:18.212,00:37:19.960
"Of course, in all
of the cases, you",00:37:26.480,00:37:28.220
"have the kinetic energy
of the center of mass.",00:37:28.220,00:37:30.640
"And presumably since we are
getting the right answer",00:37:36.450,00:37:42.100
"at very high temperatures now,
we also have the rotations.",00:37:42.100,00:37:45.790
"And it makes sense
that essentially",00:37:51.150,00:37:52.910
"what happened as we go
to very low temperatures",00:37:52.910,00:37:59.420
"is that the rotations
are also frozen out.",00:37:59.420,00:38:02.130
"Now, that's part of
the story-- actually,",00:38:08.590,00:38:11.750
"you would think that among all
of the examples that I gave",00:38:11.750,00:38:15.770
"you, this last one should be
the simplest thing because it's",00:38:15.770,00:38:20.010
really a two-body problem.,00:38:20.010,00:38:21.810
"Whereas, solids you
have many things.",00:38:21.810,00:38:23.730
"Radiation, you
have to think about",00:38:23.730,00:38:25.470
"the electromagnetic
waves, et cetera.",00:38:25.470,00:38:27.930
"That somehow,
historically, this would",00:38:27.930,00:38:29.840
"be the one that
is resolved first.",00:38:29.840,00:38:33.080
"And indeed, as I said
in 1905, Einstein",00:38:33.080,00:38:36.800
"figured out
something about this.",00:38:36.800,00:38:38.950
"But this part dealing with the
rotational degrees of freedom",00:38:38.950,00:38:43.780
"and quantizing
them appropriately",00:38:43.780,00:38:46.170
"had to really wait until you
had developed quantum mechanics",00:38:46.170,00:38:50.420
"beyond the statement
that harmonic oscillators",00:38:50.420,00:38:53.300
are quantized in energy.,00:38:53.300,00:38:54.830
You had to know something more.,00:38:54.830,00:38:57.440
"So since in retrospect we
do know something more,",00:38:57.440,00:39:02.000
"let's finish and
give that answer",00:39:02.000,00:39:04.410
"before going on
to something else.",00:39:04.410,00:39:09.180
OK?,00:39:09.180,00:39:10.970
"So the next part of the
story of the diatomic gas",00:39:10.970,00:39:15.820
is quantizing rotations.,00:39:15.820,00:39:19.630
"So currently what I have is that
there is an energy classically",00:39:24.630,00:39:32.150
"for rotations that is
simply the kinetic energy",00:39:32.150,00:39:38.960
"of rotational
degrees of freedom.",00:39:38.960,00:39:41.680
"So there is an
angular momentum L,",00:39:41.680,00:39:43.780
"and then there's
L squared over 2I.",00:39:43.780,00:39:46.150
"It looks pretty much
like P squared over 2M,",00:39:46.150,00:39:49.880
"except that the
degrees of freedom",00:39:49.880,00:39:54.360
"for translation and
motion are positions.",00:39:54.360,00:39:57.950
They can be all over the place.,00:39:57.950,00:40:00.030
"Whereas, the degrees
of freedom that you",00:40:00.030,00:40:01.750
"have to think in
terms of rotations",00:40:01.750,00:40:04.000
"are angles that go
between 0, 2 pi,",00:40:04.000,00:40:06.830
"or on the surface of
a sphere, et cetera.",00:40:06.830,00:40:11.190
"So once we figure out how
to do quantum mechanics,",00:40:11.190,00:40:16.810
"we find that the
allowed values of this",00:40:16.810,00:40:22.110
"are of the form h bar squared
over 2I l, l plus 1, where",00:40:22.110,00:40:29.270
"l now is the number that gives
you the discrete values that",00:40:29.270,00:40:36.290
"are possible for the square
of the angular momentum.",00:40:36.290,00:40:41.070
"So you say OK, let's calculate
a Z for the rotational degrees",00:40:41.070,00:40:45.690
"of freedom assuming this
kind of quantization.",00:40:45.690,00:40:50.110
"So what I have to do, like I
did for the harmonic oscillator,",00:40:50.110,00:40:54.160
"is I sum over all possible
values of l that are allowed.",00:40:54.160,00:40:58.890
"The energy e to the minus
beta h bar squared over 2I",00:40:58.890,00:41:04.220
"l, l plus 1.",00:41:04.220,00:41:05.340
"Except that there
is one other thing,",00:41:07.860,00:41:10.500
"which is that these
different values of l",00:41:10.500,00:41:13.910
"have degeneracy
that is 2l plus 1.",00:41:13.910,00:41:19.370
"And so you have to multiply by
the corresponding degeneracy.",00:41:19.370,00:41:26.290
So what am I doing over here?,00:41:30.820,00:41:34.280
"I have to do a sum over
different values of l,",00:41:34.280,00:41:41.110
"contributions that are
really the probability that I",00:41:41.110,00:41:45.410
"am in these different values of
the index l-- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,",00:41:45.410,00:41:51.329
6.,00:41:51.329,00:41:51.828
"And I have to add all
of these contributions.",00:41:54.790,00:41:58.970
"Now, the first
thing that I will do",00:42:02.570,00:42:05.660
"is I ask whether the limit
of high temperatures that I",00:42:05.660,00:42:09.320
"had calculated before is
correctly reproduced or not.",00:42:09.320,00:42:13.860
"So I have to go to the limit
where temperature is high",00:42:13.860,00:42:17.090
or beta goes to 0.,00:42:17.090,00:42:19.340
"If beta goes to 0,
you can see that going",00:42:19.340,00:42:22.310
"from one l to another
l, it is multiply",00:42:22.310,00:42:25.150
this exponent by a small number.,00:42:25.150,00:42:28.050
So what does that mean?,00:42:28.050,00:42:29.290
"It means that the values from
one point to another point",00:42:29.290,00:42:32.730
"of what am I summing over is
not really that different.",00:42:32.730,00:42:37.350
"And I can think of a
continuous curve that",00:42:37.350,00:42:41.020
"goes through all
of these points.",00:42:41.020,00:42:44.090
"So if I do that, then
I can essentially",00:42:44.090,00:42:46.450
"replace the sum
with an integral.",00:42:46.450,00:42:48.240
"In fact, you can systematically
calculate corrections",00:43:00.970,00:43:04.580
"to replacing the sum with
an integral mathematically",00:43:04.580,00:43:08.330
"and you have a problem set
that shows you how to do that.",00:43:08.330,00:43:13.590
"But now what I can do is I
can call this combination l, l",00:43:13.590,00:43:18.580
plus 1 x.,00:43:18.580,00:43:21.330
"And then dx will
simply be 2l plus 1 dl.",00:43:21.330,00:43:26.940
"So essentially, the
degeneracy works out precisely",00:43:29.550,00:43:35.630
"so that when I go to the
continuum limit, whatever",00:43:35.630,00:43:39.110
"quantization I had for
these angular momenta",00:43:39.110,00:43:43.120
"corresponds to the
weight or measure",00:43:43.120,00:43:45.110
"that I would have in stepping
around the l-directions.",00:43:45.110,00:43:48.770
"And then, this is something
that I can easily do.",00:43:48.770,00:43:53.320
"It's just an integral dx
e to the minus alpha x.",00:43:53.320,00:43:57.280
"The answer is going to be 1 over
alpha, or the answer to this",00:43:57.280,00:44:01.830
is simply 2I beta h bar squared.,00:44:01.830,00:44:06.785
"So this is the classical
limit of the expression",00:44:14.680,00:44:18.130
that we had over here.,00:44:18.130,00:44:20.260
"Let's go and see what we had
when we did things classically.",00:44:20.260,00:44:23.465
"So when we did
things classically,",00:44:27.570,00:44:29.820
"I had two factors of
h and 2 pi and 4 pi.",00:44:29.820,00:44:35.890
"So I can write the whole
thing as h bar squared and 2.",00:44:35.890,00:44:40.100
"I have I, and then I have beta.",00:44:40.100,00:44:43.902
"And you can see that
this is exactly what we",00:44:43.902,00:44:48.360
have over there.,00:44:48.360,00:44:49.610
"So once more, properly
accounting for phase space,",00:44:49.610,00:44:55.920
"measure, productive p
q's being dimension--",00:44:55.920,00:45:01.150
"made dimensionless
by this quantity h",00:45:01.150,00:45:05.400
"is equivalent to the
high temperature limit",00:45:05.400,00:45:10.080
"that you would get
in quantum mechanics",00:45:10.080,00:45:11.990
where things are discretized.,00:45:11.990,00:45:13.230
Yes.,00:45:13.230,00:45:15.030
"AUDIENCE: When you're
talking about the quantum",00:45:15.030,00:45:17.832
"interpretations, then h
bar is the precise value",00:45:17.832,00:45:20.686
"of Planck's constant, which
can be an experimental measure.",00:45:20.686,00:45:23.150
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:45:23.150,00:45:23.858
"AUDIENCE: But when
you're talking",00:45:23.858,00:45:25.260
"about the classical derivations,
h is just some factor",00:45:25.260,00:45:29.082
"that we mention of
curve dimension.",00:45:29.082,00:45:30.540
PROFESSOR: That's correct.,00:45:30.540,00:45:32.026
"AUDIENCE: So if you're
comparing the limits",00:45:32.026,00:45:35.802
"of large temperatures,
how can you",00:45:35.802,00:45:40.710
"be sure to establish the
h bar in two places means",00:45:40.710,00:45:45.263
the same thing?,00:45:45.263,00:45:46.555
"PROFESSOR: So far,
I haven't told",00:45:46.555,00:45:47.930
you anything to justify that.,00:45:47.930,00:45:50.390
"So when we were doing
things classically,",00:45:50.390,00:45:52.760
"we said that just to make
things dimensionless,",00:45:52.760,00:45:55.870
"let's introduce this
quantity that we call h.",00:45:55.870,00:46:00.380
"Now, I have shown you
two examples where",00:46:00.380,00:46:03.800
"if you do things quantum
mechanically properly",00:46:03.800,00:46:07.710
"and take the limit of
going to high temperatures,",00:46:07.710,00:46:10.930
"you will see that the
h that you would get--",00:46:10.930,00:46:14.060
"because the quantum
mechanical partition functions",00:46:14.060,00:46:16.660
"are dimensionless
quantities, right?",00:46:16.660,00:46:19.500
"So these are
dimensionless quantities.",00:46:19.500,00:46:21.650
"They have to be made
dimensionless by something.",00:46:21.650,00:46:24.140
"They're made dimensionless
by Boltzmann's constant.",00:46:24.140,00:46:27.530
"By a Planck's constant, h bar.",00:46:27.530,00:46:30.880
"And we can see
that as long as we",00:46:30.880,00:46:33.270
"are consistent with this
measure of phase space,",00:46:33.270,00:46:36.330
"the same constant shows up both
for the case of the vibrations,",00:46:36.330,00:46:41.980
for the case of the rotations.,00:46:41.980,00:46:46.610
"And very soon, we will
see that it will also",00:46:46.610,00:46:49.100
"arise in the case of
the center of mass.",00:46:49.100,00:46:51.780
"And so there is certainly
something in the transcriptions",00:46:51.780,00:47:00.010
"that we ultimately will make
between quantum mechanics",00:47:00.010,00:47:04.130
"and classical mechanics
that must account for this.",00:47:04.130,00:47:08.080
"And somehow in the limit where
quantum mechanics is dealing",00:47:08.080,00:47:12.640
"with large energies,
it is indistinguishable",00:47:12.640,00:47:16.510
from classical mechanics.,00:47:16.510,00:47:19.160
"And quantum partition
functions are--",00:47:19.160,00:47:23.840
"all of the countings that we do
in quantum mechanics are kind",00:47:23.840,00:47:26.990
"of unambiguous because we are
dealing with discrete levels.",00:47:26.990,00:47:30.880
"So if you remember the
original part of the difficulty",00:47:30.880,00:47:34.960
"was that we could define
things like entropy only",00:47:34.960,00:47:39.150
"properly when we
had discrete levels.",00:47:39.150,00:47:41.820
"If we had a continuum
probability distribution",00:47:41.820,00:47:44.380
"and if we made a
change of variable,",00:47:44.380,00:47:46.650
then the entropy was changed.,00:47:46.650,00:47:49.240
"But in quantum mechanics,
we don't have that problem.",00:47:49.240,00:47:52.290
"We have discretized values
for the different states.",00:47:52.290,00:47:57.080
"Probabilities will be-- once
we deal with them appropriately",00:47:57.080,00:48:00.910
be discretized.,00:48:00.910,00:48:02.640
"And all of the things
here are dimensionless.",00:48:02.640,00:48:06.190
"And somehow they reproduce the
correct classical dynamics.",00:48:06.190,00:48:11.490
"Quantum mechanics goes
to classical mechanics",00:48:11.490,00:48:13.830
"in the appropriate
high-energy limit.",00:48:13.830,00:48:16.090
"And what we find is that what
happens is that this shows up.",00:48:16.090,00:48:22.440
"If you like, another
way of achieving--",00:48:22.440,00:48:28.720
"why is there this
correspondence?",00:48:28.720,00:48:32.630
"In classical
statistical mechanics,",00:48:32.630,00:48:36.920
"I emphasize that I should really
write h in units of p and q.",00:48:36.920,00:48:43.390
"And it was only when I
calculated partition functions",00:48:43.390,00:48:47.870
"in coordinates p and q that were
canonically conjugate that I",00:48:47.870,00:48:51.880
"was getting results
that were meaningful.",00:48:51.880,00:48:54.350
"One way of constructing
quantum mechanics",00:48:58.260,00:49:01.600
"is that you take the
Hamiltonian and you change these",00:49:01.600,00:49:04.720
into operators.,00:49:04.720,00:49:06.200
"And you have to impose these
kinds of commutation relations.",00:49:06.200,00:49:14.950
"So you can see that somehow
the same prescription in terms",00:49:14.950,00:49:19.480
"of phase space appears both
in statistical mechanics,",00:49:19.480,00:49:23.780
"in calculating measures
of partition function,",00:49:23.780,00:49:26.340
in quantum mechanics.,00:49:26.340,00:49:27.950
"And not surprisingly, you have
introduced in quantum mechanics",00:49:27.950,00:49:31.710
"some unit for phase space p, q.",00:49:31.710,00:49:35.260
"It shows up in
classical mechanics",00:49:35.260,00:49:37.810
as the quantity [INAUDIBLE].,00:49:37.810,00:49:39.020
"But there is, indeed,
a little bit more work",00:49:43.220,00:49:46.200
"than I have shown you
here that one can do.",00:49:46.200,00:49:49.100
"Once we have developed
the appropriate formalism",00:49:49.100,00:49:53.650
"for quantum statistical
mechanics, which",00:49:53.650,00:49:56.900
"is this [INAUDIBLE] performed
and appropriate quantities",00:49:56.900,00:50:01.230
"defined for partition
functions, et cetera,",00:50:01.230,00:50:04.500
"in quantum statistical
mechanics that we",00:50:04.500,00:50:06.780
will do in a couple of lectures.,00:50:06.780,00:50:08.620
"Then if you take the
limit h bar goes to 0,",00:50:08.620,00:50:11.260
"you should get the classical
integration over phase space",00:50:11.260,00:50:15.100
"with this factor
of h showing up.",00:50:15.100,00:50:18.412
"But right now, we
are just giving you",00:50:23.290,00:50:25.400
some heuristic response.,00:50:25.400,00:50:29.910
"If I go, however, in
the other limit, where",00:50:29.910,00:50:32.610
"beta is much larger
than 1, what do I get?",00:50:32.610,00:50:40.370
"Basically, then
all of the weight",00:50:40.370,00:50:43.210
"is going to be in the
lowest energy level, 0, 1.",00:50:43.210,00:50:48.560
"And then the rest of them
will be exponentially small.",00:50:48.560,00:50:52.400
"I cannot replace the
sum with an integral,",00:50:52.400,00:50:55.840
"so basically I will get a
contribution that starts with 1",00:50:55.840,00:51:00.380
for l equals to 0.,00:51:00.380,00:51:03.140
"And then I will get
3e to the minus beta h",00:51:03.140,00:51:10.000
bar squared divided by 2I.,00:51:10.000,00:51:13.630
"l being 1, this will
give me 1 times 2.",00:51:13.630,00:51:17.770
So I will have a 2 here.,00:51:17.770,00:51:20.760
"And then, higher-order terms.",00:51:20.760,00:51:22.220
"So once you have the
partition function,",00:51:28.360,00:51:35.120
"you go through
the same procedure",00:51:35.120,00:51:36.730
as we described before.,00:51:36.730,00:51:39.230
"You calculate the energy,
which is d log Z by d beta.",00:51:39.230,00:51:45.440
What do you get?,00:51:48.460,00:51:51.230
"Again, in the high
temperature limit",00:51:51.230,00:51:53.300
"you will get the same
answer as before.",00:51:53.300,00:51:55.610
So you will get beta goes to 0.,00:51:55.610,00:51:59.390
You will get kT.,00:51:59.390,00:52:01.320
"If you go to the low
temperature limit-- well,",00:52:04.100,00:52:06.770
let's be more precise.,00:52:06.770,00:52:08.440
"What do I mean by
low temperatures?",00:52:08.440,00:52:10.390
Beta larger than what?,00:52:10.390,00:52:13.740
"Clearly, the unit that
is appearing everywhere",00:52:13.740,00:52:17.050
"is this beta h bar squared
over 2I, which has units of 1",00:52:17.050,00:52:26.690
over temperature from beta.,00:52:26.690,00:52:30.200
"So I can introduce a
theta for rotations",00:52:30.200,00:52:34.220
"to make this demonstrate
that this is dimensionless.",00:52:34.220,00:52:37.920
"So the theta that
goes with rotations",00:52:37.920,00:52:41.120
is h bar squared over 2I kb.,00:52:41.120,00:52:48.650
"And so what I mean by going
to the low temperatures",00:52:48.650,00:52:53.630
"is that I go for
temperatures that",00:52:53.630,00:52:55.610
"are much less than the
theta of these rotations.",00:52:55.610,00:53:00.910
"And then what happens is
that essentially this state",00:53:00.910,00:53:06.780
"will occur with exponentially
small probability",00:53:06.780,00:53:10.590
"and will contribute to
the energy and amount that",00:53:10.590,00:53:14.320
"is of the order of h
bar squared 2I times 2.",00:53:14.320,00:53:19.490
"That's the energy of
the l equals to 1 state.",00:53:19.490,00:53:22.780
"There are three of them, and
they occur with probability e",00:53:22.780,00:53:26.570
"to the minus theta
rotation divided",00:53:26.570,00:53:31.400
by T times a factor of 2.,00:53:31.400,00:53:34.118
"All of those factors is
not particularly important.",00:53:37.870,00:53:40.870
"Really, the only thing
that is important",00:53:40.870,00:53:45.100
"is that if I look now at the
rotational heat capacity, which",00:53:45.100,00:53:50.600
"again should properly
have units of kb,",00:53:50.600,00:53:55.160
as a function of temperature.,00:53:55.160,00:53:56.770
"Well, temperatures
I have to make",00:53:56.770,00:53:59.320
"dimensionless by dividing by
this rotational heat capacity.",00:53:59.320,00:54:04.380
"I say that at
high, temperature I",00:54:04.380,00:54:06.280
get the classical result back.,00:54:06.280,00:54:08.810
"So basically, I will get
to 1 at high temperatures.",00:54:08.810,00:54:15.160
"At low temperatures, again
I have this situation",00:54:15.160,00:54:19.070
"that there is a gap in
the allowed energies.",00:54:19.070,00:54:22.830
"So there is the lowest
energy, which is 0.",00:54:22.830,00:54:27.160
"The next one, the first type of
rotational mode that is allowed",00:54:27.160,00:54:31.490
"has a finite energy
that is larger than that",00:54:31.490,00:54:34.100
"by an amount that is of the
order of h bar squared over I.",00:54:34.100,00:54:37.960
"And if I am at these
temperatures that",00:54:37.960,00:54:40.120
"are less than this
theta of rotation,",00:54:40.120,00:54:42.840
"I simply don't
have enough energy",00:54:42.840,00:54:45.870
"from thermal fluctuations
to get to that level.",00:54:45.870,00:54:50.660
"So the occupation of that level
will be exponentially small.",00:54:50.660,00:54:54.820
"And so I will have a curve that
will, in fact, look something",00:54:54.820,00:54:57.940
like this.,00:54:57.940,00:54:58.912
"So again, you basically
go over at a temperature",00:55:04.270,00:55:09.270
"of the order of 1
from heat capacity",00:55:09.270,00:55:12.500
"that is order of 1 to heat
capacity that is exponentially",00:55:12.500,00:55:17.000
"small when you get to
temperatures that are lower",00:55:17.000,00:55:24.740
"than this rotational
temperature.",00:55:24.740,00:55:28.740
"AUDIENCE: Is that
over-shooting, or is that--",00:55:28.740,00:55:30.680
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:55:30.680,00:55:31.780
"So you have a
problem set where you",00:55:31.780,00:55:35.260
calculate the next correction.,00:55:35.260,00:55:37.700
"So there is the summation
replacing the sum",00:55:37.700,00:55:41.100
with an integral.,00:55:41.100,00:55:43.290
"This gives you this
to the first order,",00:55:43.290,00:55:45.850
and then there's a correction.,00:55:45.850,00:55:48.040
"And you will show that
the correction is such",00:55:48.040,00:55:51.440
"that there is actually
the approach to one",00:55:51.440,00:55:54.790
"for the case of the rotational
heat capacity is from above.",00:55:54.790,00:55:59.250
"Whereas, for the
vibrational heat capacity,",00:55:59.250,00:56:01.940
it is from below.,00:56:01.940,00:56:05.000
"So there is, indeed,
a small bump.",00:56:05.000,00:56:07.308
OK?,00:56:12.676,00:56:15.610
"So you can ask, well, I
know the typical size of one",00:56:15.610,00:56:24.050
of these oxygen molecules.,00:56:24.050,00:56:26.610
I know the mass.,00:56:26.610,00:56:28.020
"I can figure out what the
moment of inertia I is.",00:56:28.020,00:56:33.120
"I put it over here and I figure
out what the theta of rotation",00:56:33.120,00:56:37.100
is.,00:56:37.100,00:56:37.840
"And you find that, again, as a
matter of order of magnitudes,",00:56:37.840,00:56:41.880
"theta of rotations is of
the order of 10 degrees",00:56:41.880,00:56:46.220
"K. So this kind of accounts for
why when you go to sufficiently",00:56:46.220,00:56:56.120
"low temperatures for the
heat capacity of the gas",00:56:56.120,00:56:58.820
"in this room, we
see that essentially",00:56:58.820,00:57:01.770
"the rotational degrees of
freedom are also frozen out.",00:57:01.770,00:57:05.220
OK.,00:57:13.558,00:57:14.058
"So now let's go to the
second item that we have,",00:57:18.990,00:57:25.370
"which is the heat
capacity of the solid.",00:57:25.370,00:57:27.780
So what do I mean?,00:57:27.780,00:57:28.855
"So this is item 2,
heat capacity of solid.",00:57:31.920,00:57:35.610
"And you measure heat
capacities for some solid",00:57:43.710,00:57:51.020
as a function of temperature.,00:57:51.020,00:57:53.880
"And what you find is
that the heat capacity",00:57:53.880,00:57:57.430
has a behavior such as this.,00:57:57.430,00:58:00.970
"So it seems to
vanish as you to go",00:58:04.950,00:58:07.810
to lower and lower temperatures.,00:58:07.810,00:58:10.320
So what's going on here?,00:58:10.320,00:58:11.610
"Again, Einstein looked at
this and said, well, it's",00:58:15.690,00:58:21.060
"another case of the story of
vibrations and some things",00:58:21.060,00:58:25.270
that we have looked at here.,00:58:25.270,00:58:28.370
"And in fact, I really don't
have to do any calculation.",00:58:28.370,00:58:32.490
I'll do the following.,00:58:32.490,00:58:34.340
"Let's imagine that this is
what we have for the solid.",00:58:34.340,00:58:37.620
"It's some regular arrangement
of atoms or molecules.",00:58:37.620,00:58:41.290
"And presumably, this
is the situation",00:58:46.630,00:58:50.910
that I have at 0 temperature.,00:58:50.910,00:58:52.450
"Everybody is
sitting nicely where",00:58:52.450,00:58:55.770
"they should be to
minimize the energy.",00:58:55.770,00:58:58.500
"If I go to finite temperature,
then these atoms and molecules",00:58:58.500,00:59:02.420
start to vibrate.,00:59:02.420,00:59:03.650
"And he said, well,
basically, I can",00:59:08.320,00:59:13.480
"estimate the frequencies
of vibrations.",00:59:13.480,00:59:17.912
"And what I will do is I
will say that each atom is",00:59:17.912,00:59:26.840
in a cage by its neighbors.,00:59:26.840,00:59:31.430
"That is, this particular atom
here, if it wants to move,",00:59:35.740,00:59:43.200
"it find that its distance to
the neighbors has been changed.",00:59:43.200,00:59:51.610
"And if I imagine
that there are kind",00:59:51.610,00:59:53.370
"of springs that are
connecting this atom only",00:59:53.370,00:59:57.750
"to its neighbors,
moving around there",00:59:57.750,01:00:01.630
"will be some kind of
a restoring force.",01:00:01.630,01:00:05.610
"So it's like it is
sitting in some kind",01:00:05.610,01:00:09.160
of a harmonic potential.,01:00:09.160,01:00:11.690
"And if it tries to
move, it will experience",01:00:11.690,01:00:15.820
this restoring force.,01:00:15.820,01:00:17.270
"And so it will have some
kind of a frequency.",01:00:17.270,01:00:21.730
"So each atom vibrates
at some frequency.",01:00:21.730,01:00:30.520
Let's call it omega E.,01:00:35.499,01:00:40.370
"Now, in principle,
in this picture",01:00:40.370,01:00:44.210
"if this cage is not
exactly symmetric,",01:00:44.210,01:00:47.050
"you may imagine that
oscillations in the three",01:00:47.050,01:00:49.600
"different directions could
give you different frequencies.",01:00:49.600,01:00:52.820
"But let's ignore that and let's
imagine that the frequencies is",01:00:52.820,01:00:56.140
the same in all of these.,01:00:56.140,01:00:58.790
So what have we done?,01:00:58.790,01:01:00.190
"We have reduced the problem
of the excitation energy",01:01:00.190,01:01:04.220
"that you can put in the
atoms of the solid to be",01:01:04.220,01:01:08.340
"the same now as 3N harmonic
oscillators of frequency omega.",01:01:08.340,01:01:21.330
Why 3N?,01:01:24.150,01:01:25.100
"Because each atom
essentially sees restoring",01:01:25.100,01:01:28.620
force in three directions.,01:01:28.620,01:01:30.380
"And forgetting about
boundary effects,",01:01:30.380,01:01:32.790
"it's basically
three per particle.",01:01:32.790,01:01:35.240
"So you would have said that
the heat capacity that I would",01:01:35.240,01:01:39.270
"calculate per particle
in units of kb",01:01:39.270,01:01:47.200
"should essentially be exactly
what we have over here,",01:01:47.200,01:01:52.770
"except that I multiply by 3
because each particular has",01:01:52.770,01:01:55.910
3 possible degrees of freedom.,01:01:55.910,01:01:57.830
"So all I need to do is
to take that green curve",01:01:57.830,01:02:01.620
"and multiply it
by a factor of 3.",01:02:01.620,01:02:04.540
"And indeed, the limiting value
that you get over here is 3.",01:02:04.540,01:02:11.080
"Except that if I just
take that green curve",01:02:11.080,01:02:14.830
"and superpose it on
this, what I will get",01:02:14.830,01:02:18.420
is something like this.,01:02:18.420,01:02:19.665
"So this is 3 times
harmonic oscillator.",01:02:24.980,01:02:31.545
"What do I mean by that, is
I try to sort of do my best",01:02:39.530,01:02:44.240
"to match the
temperature at which you",01:02:44.240,01:02:47.110
go from one to the other.,01:02:47.110,01:02:49.210
"But then what I find is that
as we had established before,",01:02:49.210,01:02:53.550
"the green curve goes
to 0 exponentially.",01:02:53.550,01:02:57.300
"So there is going to be
some theta associated",01:02:57.300,01:03:00.770
with this frequency.,01:03:00.770,01:03:02.950
"Let's call it theta
Einstein divided by T.",01:03:02.950,01:03:06.400
"And so the prediction
of this model",01:03:06.400,01:03:10.440
"is that the heat capacities
should vanish very rapidly",01:03:10.440,01:03:16.140
as this form of exponential.,01:03:16.140,01:03:18.255
"Whereas, what is actually
observed in the experiment",01:03:18.255,01:03:22.050
"is that it is going
to 0 proportional",01:03:22.050,01:03:25.182
"to T cubed, which is a
much slower type of decay.",01:03:25.182,01:03:33.200
OK?,01:03:33.200,01:03:35.304
"AUDIENCE: That's
negative [INAUDIBLE]?",01:03:35.304,01:03:38.650
"PROFESSOR: As T goes to 0,
the heat capacity goes to 0.",01:03:38.650,01:03:43.810
T to the third power.,01:03:43.810,01:03:45.030
"So it's the limit-- did I
make a mistake somewhere else?",01:03:48.920,01:03:51.910
All right.,01:03:56.710,01:03:57.670
So what's happening here?,01:03:57.670,01:04:02.080
"OK, so what's happening
is the following.",01:04:02.080,01:04:05.370
"In some average
sense, it is correct",01:04:08.590,01:04:12.010
"that if you try to oscillate
some atom in the crystal,",01:04:12.010,01:04:18.430
"it's going to have some
characteristic restoring force.",01:04:18.430,01:04:22.660
"The characteristic
restoring force",01:04:22.660,01:04:24.850
"will give you some
corresponding typical scale",01:04:24.850,01:04:28.660
"for the frequencies
of the vibrations.",01:04:28.660,01:04:30.460
Yes?,01:04:32.845,01:04:33.345
"AUDIENCE: Is this the
historical progression?",01:04:36.076,01:04:38.490
PROFESSOR: Yes.,01:04:38.490,01:04:39.115
"AUDIENCE: I mean, it seems
interesting that they",01:04:42.710,01:04:44.970
"would know that-- like this
cage hypothesis is very good,",01:04:44.970,01:04:48.570
"considering where a
quantum [INAUDIBLE] exists.",01:04:48.570,01:04:52.707
"I don't understand how
that's the logic based--",01:04:56.980,01:04:59.170
"if what we know is the
top board over there,",01:04:59.170,01:05:01.690
"the logical progression is that
you would have-- I don't know.",01:05:01.690,01:05:08.657
PROFESSOR: No.,01:05:08.657,01:05:09.240
"At that time, the proposal
was that essentially",01:05:12.660,01:05:18.120
"if you have oscillator
of frequency omega,",01:05:18.120,01:05:22.000
"its energy is quantized
in multiples of omega.",01:05:22.000,01:05:25.200
"So that's really the only
aspect of quantum mechanics.",01:05:25.200,01:05:27.800
"So I actually jumped the
historical development",01:05:27.800,01:05:31.310
"where I gave you the
rotational degrees of freedom.",01:05:31.310,01:05:35.030
"So as I said, historically this
was resolved last in this part",01:05:35.030,01:05:42.761
"because they didn't know
what to do with rotations.",01:05:42.761,01:05:44.885
"But now I'm saying that
you know about rotations,",01:05:48.910,01:05:52.040
"you know that the heat
capacity goes to 0.",01:05:52.040,01:05:54.860
"You say, well,
solid is composed.",01:05:54.860,01:05:58.910
"The way that you put
heat into the system,",01:05:58.910,01:06:01.450
"enhance its heat capacity, is
because there is kinetic energy",01:06:01.450,01:06:05.240
"that you put in the
atoms of the solid.",01:06:05.240,01:06:07.620
"And as you try to
put kinetic energy,",01:06:07.620,01:06:10.090
"there is this cage model
and there's restoring force.",01:06:10.090,01:06:14.080
"The thing that is
wrong about this model",01:06:14.080,01:06:16.610
"is that, basically, if you ask
how easy it is to give energy",01:06:16.610,01:06:24.420
"to the system, if rather
than having one frequency",01:06:24.420,01:06:28.530
"you have multiple frequencies,
then at low temperatures",01:06:28.530,01:06:33.150
"you would put energy
in the lower frequency.",01:06:33.150,01:06:36.840
"Because the typical scale we
saw for connecting temperature",01:06:36.840,01:06:44.800
"and frequency, they are kind
of proportional to each other.",01:06:44.800,01:06:47.850
"So if you want to go
to low temperature,",01:06:47.850,01:06:50.310
"you are bound to excite things
that have lower frequency.",01:06:50.310,01:06:55.290
"So the thing is that
it is true that there",01:06:55.290,01:06:58.025
is a typical frequency.,01:06:58.025,01:07:00.310
"But the typical frequency
becomes less and less important",01:07:00.310,01:07:03.990
as you go to low temperature.,01:07:03.990,01:07:06.010
"The issue is, what are
the lowest frequencies",01:07:06.010,01:07:08.840
of excitation?,01:07:08.840,01:07:11.160
"And basically, the
correct picture",01:07:11.160,01:07:13.510
"of excitations of the solid
is that you bang on something",01:07:13.510,01:07:17.890
"and you generate
these sound waves.",01:07:17.890,01:07:22.180
"So what you have is that
oscillations or vibrations",01:07:22.180,01:07:32.550
"of solid are characterized
by wavelength and wave number",01:07:32.550,01:07:50.240
"k, 2 pi over lambda.",01:07:50.240,01:08:01.290
"So if I really take a
better model of the solid",01:08:01.290,01:08:19.450
"in which I have springs that
connect all of these things",01:08:19.450,01:08:27.069
"together and ask, what are
the normal modes of vibration?",01:08:27.069,01:08:33.290
"I find that the normal
modes can be characterized",01:08:33.290,01:08:36.970
by some wave number k.,01:08:36.970,01:08:39.660
"As I said, it's the
inverse of the wavelength.",01:08:39.660,01:08:43.399
"And frequency depends
on wave number.",01:08:43.399,01:08:47.819
"In a manner that when you go
to 0k, frequency goes to 0.",01:08:47.819,01:08:56.069
And why is that?,01:08:56.069,01:08:57.340
"Essentially, what I'm
saying is that if you",01:08:57.340,01:09:00.819
"look at particles
that are along a line",01:09:00.819,01:09:05.420
and may be connected by springs.,01:09:05.420,01:09:07.649
"So a kind of one-dimensional
version of a solid.",01:09:07.649,01:09:11.859
"Then, the normal modes
are characterized",01:09:11.859,01:09:14.920
"by distortions that have
some particular wavelength.",01:09:14.920,01:09:18.124
"And in the limit
where the wavelength",01:09:23.160,01:09:26.350
"goes to 0, essentially--",01:09:26.350,01:09:30.439
"Sorry, in the limit
where the wavelength goes",01:09:30.439,01:09:32.580
"to infinity or k
goes to 0, it looks",01:09:32.580,01:09:36.729
"like I am taking
all of the particles",01:09:36.729,01:09:38.990
and translating them together.,01:09:38.990,01:09:43.120
"And if I take the entire
solid here and translate it,",01:09:43.120,01:09:47.910
there is no restoring force.,01:09:47.910,01:09:50.124
"So omega has to go to
0 as your k goes to 0,",01:09:50.124,01:09:55.370
or wavelength goes to infinity.,01:09:55.370,01:09:57.810
"And there is a symmetry
between k and minus k,",01:09:57.810,01:10:01.920
"in fact, that forces
the restoring force",01:10:01.920,01:10:04.240
to be proportional to k squared.,01:10:04.240,01:10:06.560
"And when you take the
square root of that,",01:10:06.560,01:10:08.570
you get the frequency.,01:10:08.570,01:10:10.170
"You always get a linear
behavior as k goes to 0.",01:10:10.170,01:10:15.160
"So essentially,
that's the observation",01:10:15.160,01:10:19.810
"that whatever you
do with your solid,",01:10:19.810,01:10:22.620
"no matter how complicated,
you have sound modes.",01:10:22.620,01:10:27.140
"And sound modes are
things that happen",01:10:27.140,01:10:29.520
"in the limit where you
have long wavelengths",01:10:29.520,01:10:32.360
"and there is a relationship
between omega and k",01:10:32.360,01:10:37.930
"through some kind of
velocity of sound.",01:10:37.930,01:10:39.785
"Now, to be precise
there are really",01:10:43.400,01:10:49.370
three types of sound waves.,01:10:49.370,01:10:51.910
"If I choose the
direction k along which",01:10:51.910,01:10:55.360
"I want to create an
oscillation, the distortions",01:10:55.360,01:10:58.650
"can be either along that
direction or perpendicular",01:10:58.650,01:11:01.760
to that.,01:11:01.760,01:11:02.790
"They can either be
longitudinal or transfers.",01:11:02.790,01:11:07.830
"So there could be one
or two other branches.",01:11:07.830,01:11:12.340
"So there could, in principle,
be different straight lines",01:11:12.340,01:11:15.470
as k goes to 0.,01:11:15.470,01:11:17.560
"And the other
thing is that there",01:11:17.560,01:11:19.920
"is a shortest wavelength
that you can think about.",01:11:19.920,01:11:23.470
"So if these particles
are a distance a apart,",01:11:23.470,01:11:28.670
"there is no sense in
going to wave numbers that",01:11:28.670,01:11:31.840
are larger than pi over a.,01:11:31.840,01:11:34.390
"So you have some
limit to these curves.",01:11:34.390,01:11:38.400
"And indeed, when you
approach the boundary,",01:11:38.400,01:11:41.010
"this linear dependence
can shift and change",01:11:41.010,01:11:43.475
in all kinds of possible ways.,01:11:43.475,01:11:46.270
"And calculating the
frequency inside one",01:11:46.270,01:11:51.480
"of these units that is
called a Brillouin zone",01:11:51.480,01:12:00.526
"is a nice thing
to do for the case",01:12:00.526,01:12:05.980
of using methods of solid state.,01:12:05.980,01:12:09.180
And you've probably seen that.,01:12:09.180,01:12:11.660
"And there is a whole
spectrum of frequencies",01:12:11.660,01:12:18.390
"as a function of
wave number that",01:12:18.390,01:12:21.570
correctly characterize a solid.,01:12:21.570,01:12:24.280
"So it may be that somewhere
in the middle of this spectrum",01:12:24.280,01:12:27.370
"is a typical frequency
omega E. But the point is",01:12:27.370,01:12:32.300
"that as you go to lower
and lower temperatures,",01:12:32.300,01:12:35.900
"because of these factors of e
to the minus beta h bar omega,",01:12:35.900,01:12:42.830
"you can see that as you go to
lower and lower temperature,",01:12:42.830,01:12:45.970
"the only things that get
excited are omegas that are also",01:12:45.970,01:12:50.370
"going to 0
proportionately to kT.",01:12:50.370,01:12:54.340
"So I can draw a line here that
corresponds to frequencies that",01:12:54.340,01:13:01.810
"are of the order
of kT over h bar.",01:13:01.810,01:13:04.372
"All of the harmonic
oscillators that",01:13:08.630,01:13:10.680
"have these larger frequencies
that occur at short wavelengths",01:13:10.680,01:13:15.190
are unimportant.,01:13:15.190,01:13:16.440
"They're kind of frozen,
just like the vibrations",01:13:16.440,01:13:19.960
"of the oxygen molecules
in this room are frozen.",01:13:19.960,01:13:22.410
You cannot put energy in them.,01:13:22.410,01:13:24.710
"They don't contribute
to heat capacity.",01:13:24.710,01:13:27.610
"But all of these
long wavelength modes",01:13:27.610,01:13:30.590
"down here have
frequencies that go to 0.",01:13:30.590,01:13:35.080
"Their excitation
possibility is large.",01:13:35.080,01:13:38.500
"And it, indeed,
these long wavelength",01:13:38.500,01:13:40.500
"modes that are easy to excite
and continue to heat capacity.",01:13:40.500,01:13:44.885
"I'll do maybe the precise
calculation next time,",01:13:48.090,01:13:51.130
"but even within this
picture we can figure out",01:13:51.130,01:13:53.610
"why the answer should be
proportional to T cubed.",01:13:53.610,01:13:56.190
"So what I need to do,
rather than counting",01:13:58.770,01:14:02.460
"all harmonic oscillators--
the factor of 3n--",01:14:02.460,01:14:06.790
"I have to count how many
oscillators have frequencies",01:14:06.790,01:14:10.380
"that are less than
this kT over h bar.",01:14:10.380,01:14:13.600
"So I claim that number of modes
with frequency less than kT",01:14:16.140,01:14:28.260
"over h bar goes like
kT over h bar cubed V.",01:14:28.260,01:14:40.970
"Essentially, what
I have to do is",01:14:40.970,01:14:43.657
"to do a summation over all k
that is less than some k max.",01:14:43.657,01:14:50.710
"This k max is set
by this condition",01:14:50.710,01:14:55.080
"that Vk max is of the
order of kT over h bar.",01:14:55.080,01:14:58.450
"So this k max is of the
order of kT over h bar V.",01:14:58.450,01:15:04.620
"So actually, to be more
precise I have to put a V here.",01:15:04.620,01:15:09.770
"So I have to count
all of the modes.",01:15:09.770,01:15:14.700
"Now, this separation
between these modes--",01:15:14.700,01:15:18.090
"if you have a box of
size l is 2 pi over l.",01:15:18.090,01:15:21.230
"So maybe we will
discuss that later on.",01:15:21.230,01:15:24.870
"But the summations
over k you will always",01:15:24.870,01:15:27.770
"replace with
integrations over k times",01:15:27.770,01:15:31.730
"the density of state, which
is V divided by 2 pi cubed.",01:15:31.730,01:15:37.900
"So this has to go
between 0 and k max.",01:15:37.900,01:15:41.880
"And so this is
proportional to V k max",01:15:41.880,01:15:46.330
"cubed, which is what
I wrote over there.",01:15:46.330,01:15:50.685
"So as I go to lower
and lower temperature,",01:15:53.300,01:15:56.000
"there are fewer and
fewer oscillators.",01:15:56.000,01:15:59.930
"The number of those
oscillators grows like T cubed.",01:15:59.930,01:16:04.620
"Each one of those
oscillators is fully excited",01:16:04.620,01:16:07.300
"as energy kT contributes
1 unit to heat capacity.",01:16:07.300,01:16:11.550
"Since the number of oscillators
goes to 0 as T cubed,",01:16:11.550,01:16:15.480
"the heat capacity that
they contribute also",01:16:15.480,01:16:18.030
goes to 0 as T cubed.,01:16:18.030,01:16:22.450
"So you don't really need
to know-- this is actually",01:16:22.450,01:16:27.860
an interesting thing to ponder.,01:16:27.860,01:16:29.570
"So rather than doing
the calculations,",01:16:29.570,01:16:31.420
maybe just think about this.,01:16:31.420,01:16:34.480
"That somehow the solid could
be arbitrarily complicated.",01:16:34.480,01:16:40.980
"So it could be
composed of molecules",01:16:40.980,01:16:44.460
that have some particular shape.,01:16:44.460,01:16:46.270
"They are forming
some strange lattice",01:16:46.270,01:16:49.460
"of some form, et cetera.",01:16:49.460,01:16:50.970
"And given the complicated
nature of the molecules,",01:16:53.920,01:16:58.180
"the spectrum that you have
for potential frequencies",01:16:58.180,01:17:02.080
"that a solid can
take, because of all",01:17:02.080,01:17:05.220
"of the different
vibrations, et cetera,",01:17:05.220,01:17:07.680
could be arbitrary complicated.,01:17:07.680,01:17:09.560
"You can have kinds of
oscillations such as the ones",01:17:09.560,01:17:13.430
that I have indicated.,01:17:13.430,01:17:16.040
"However, if you go
to low temperature,",01:17:16.040,01:17:19.230
"you are only interested
in vibrations",01:17:19.230,01:17:22.730
that are very low in frequency.,01:17:22.730,01:17:25.470
"Vibrations that are
very low in frequencies",01:17:25.470,01:17:28.090
"must correspond
to the formations",01:17:28.090,01:17:30.340
that are very long wavelength.,01:17:30.340,01:17:32.920
"And when you are
looking at things",01:17:32.920,01:17:34.340
"that are long wavelength,
this is, again,",01:17:34.340,01:17:36.250
"another thing that has
statistical in character.",01:17:36.250,01:17:38.950
"That is, rather you
are here looking",01:17:38.950,01:17:41.350
"at things that span thousands
of atoms or molecules.",01:17:41.350,01:17:47.510
"However, as you go to lower
and lower temperature,",01:17:47.510,01:17:50.510
"more and more atoms
and molecules.",01:17:50.510,01:17:53.240
"And so again, some kind of
averaging is taking place.",01:17:53.240,01:17:57.280
"All of the details,
et cetera, wash out.",01:17:57.280,01:18:00.840
"You really see some
global characteristic.",01:18:00.840,01:18:04.380
"The global characteristic
that you see",01:18:04.380,01:18:06.370
is set by this symmetry.,01:18:06.370,01:18:07.650
"Just the fact that when I
go to exactly k equals to 0,",01:18:07.650,01:18:12.580
I am translating.,01:18:12.580,01:18:13.800
I have 0 frequency.,01:18:13.800,01:18:18.190
"So when I'm doing something
that is long wavelength,",01:18:18.190,01:18:21.560
"the frequency should
somehow be proportional",01:18:21.560,01:18:24.710
to that wavelength.,01:18:24.710,01:18:25.520
"So that's just a statement
of continuity if you like.",01:18:25.520,01:18:29.120
"Once I have made that
statement, then it's",01:18:29.120,01:18:33.300
"just a calculation of how
many modes are possible.",01:18:33.300,01:18:37.170
"The number of modes will
be proportional to T cubed.",01:18:37.170,01:18:40.350
"And I will get this T
cubed law irrespective",01:18:40.350,01:18:43.885
of how complicated the solid is.,01:18:43.885,01:18:46.520

the same T cubed behavior.",01:18:46.520,01:18:50.570

from the classical behavior",01:18:50.570,01:18:55.120

behavior will depend",01:18:55.120,01:18:57.880
"on the details of
the solid, et cetera.",01:18:57.880,01:19:01.110
"But the low temperature
law, this T cubed law,",01:19:01.110,01:19:04.005
is something that is universal.,01:19:04.005,01:19:07.700
"OK, so next time around,
we will do this calculation",01:19:07.700,01:19:10.975
"in more detail, and then
