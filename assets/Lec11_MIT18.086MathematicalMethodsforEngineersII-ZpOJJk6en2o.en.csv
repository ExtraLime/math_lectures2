"PROFESSOR: OK, so
I'll start with this.",00:00:15.470,00:00:18.900
"This is a method for a
particular class of problem",00:00:18.900,00:00:25.150
"and maybe moving
interfaces, moving curves,",00:00:25.150,00:00:30.490
"curves that are -- or
surfaces, in higher dimensions,",00:00:30.490,00:00:34.010
"that are being transported, and
it's their shape that matters.",00:00:34.010,00:00:40.910
"So it's a sort of topic within
shape differential equations",00:00:40.910,00:00:48.010
"rather than particle
differential equations.",00:00:48.010,00:00:51.970
"And some cases of
this problem can",00:00:51.970,00:00:57.600
"be studied by a
particularly fast method,",00:00:57.600,00:01:00.500
"developed here at
MIT in Course 6",00:01:00.500,00:01:02.490
"actually, called the
fast marching method.",00:01:02.490,00:01:06.730
"It's really thanks
to Per-Olof Persson",00:01:06.730,00:01:09.940
"that there's now quite a
bit on the 18.086 web page.",00:01:09.940,00:01:15.400
"The basic equations that'll
be in the lecture and also",00:01:15.400,00:01:21.770
"demonstrations, quick
demos that show the point.",00:01:21.770,00:01:26.450
"And I better mention Sethian
and Osher, who jointly proposed",00:01:26.450,00:01:34.790
"the method, conceived of this
approach in the late '80s,",00:01:34.790,00:01:41.760
"and each has written a
book, or coauthored a book,",00:01:41.760,00:01:44.990
on the level set method.,00:01:44.990,00:01:47.410
"So those books are, so to speak,
the authorities on the method.",00:01:47.410,00:01:52.320
"OK, so what's the idea?",00:01:52.320,00:01:56.040
"Well, here is the
curve, the shape,",00:01:56.040,00:02:04.040
the interface that's moving.,00:02:04.040,00:02:05.760
"And let's suppose -- well,
imagine it's sort of --",00:02:05.760,00:02:11.800
"there's a wall pf fire here,
and think of it as a moving fire",00:02:11.800,00:02:17.660
front.,00:02:17.660,00:02:18.970
"Then that fire front will
move, normal to itself,",00:02:18.970,00:02:26.100
"to some later
position at time 1.",00:02:26.100,00:02:30.780
"We could normalize -- in
a perfect case when it was",00:02:30.780,00:02:38.480
"homogeneous and the speed of
movement didn't change with",00:02:38.480,00:02:43.050
"position, we could imagine
that the speed is 1.",00:02:43.050,00:02:46.550
"So where is this fire
front here at time 1?",00:02:49.350,00:02:53.020
"It contains all
the points that are",00:02:53.020,00:02:57.050
"reached from the initial
fire in unit time.",00:02:57.050,00:03:01.710
"And since we're
going at speed 1,",00:03:01.710,00:03:04.110
"let's say, this is all
the points at distance 1.",00:03:04.110,00:03:11.820
"This curve, in this
best, simplest case,",00:03:11.820,00:03:16.210
"will be the curve
that's everywhere",00:03:16.210,00:03:21.020
"a distance 1 away
from this curve.",00:03:21.020,00:03:23.050
"Now, how to describe the
curves is the key point here.",00:03:25.650,00:03:30.350
"Shall I describe the
curve by particles?",00:03:30.350,00:03:35.910
"I could imagine
these points as being",00:03:35.910,00:03:39.800
"my unknowns, my positions, and
some equation for following",00:03:39.800,00:03:46.470
them.,00:03:46.470,00:03:47.340
"So I follow those -- ordinary
differential equations,",00:03:47.340,00:03:50.410
"one for every point -- and they
reach new positions at time 1.",00:03:50.410,00:03:58.760
"And then I interpolate the next
curve, the new curve at time 1.",00:03:58.760,00:04:05.970
"Well, that's not what we do.",00:04:05.970,00:04:08.090
"That's not the idea of
the level set method,",00:04:08.090,00:04:10.340
"and I'll explain why that
idea of following particles,",00:04:10.340,00:04:16.280
"which is a totally natural one,
comes to grief, numerically,",00:04:16.280,00:04:21.760
too often.,00:04:21.760,00:04:22.340
"This picture, of course,
was like an ideal case,",00:04:26.470,00:04:31.750
"and the particles separated a
little bit, but not too much.",00:04:31.750,00:04:37.270
"Just to say in a word, the
trouble with the particle idea",00:04:37.270,00:04:40.290
"is that particles
could separate wildly,",00:04:40.290,00:04:43.240
"so you had a big, big gap
to fill in, like a fan.",00:04:43.240,00:04:48.570
"Or they could come very close
together so that you had",00:04:48.570,00:04:52.600
total instability numerically.,00:04:52.600,00:04:55.040
"You couldn't compute
any differences",00:04:55.040,00:04:56.850
"because the distance
was too small,",00:04:56.850,00:04:59.170
and that would be like a shock.,00:04:59.170,00:05:01.970
"So we're really connecting
this type of problem.",00:05:01.970,00:05:05.070
"It connects well with
the conservation laws",00:05:05.070,00:05:08.070
that we've been studying.,00:05:08.070,00:05:09.540
"Fans and shocks appear, and
I'll show you right away.",00:05:09.540,00:05:12.650
"Can I just say, what
is the approach?",00:05:12.650,00:05:16.500
"What does this word
""level set"" mean?",00:05:16.500,00:05:19.080
"Well, the level set
of a function --",00:05:19.080,00:05:23.530
"I'm saying what this
word level set is,",00:05:23.530,00:05:25.980
"and that's going to be the
way the curve is described,",00:05:25.980,00:05:29.520
sort of implicitly.,00:05:29.520,00:05:30.810
"Instead of saying
where the points are",00:05:30.810,00:05:33.340
"that are on the
curve, the curve is",00:05:33.340,00:05:35.580
"being given by an equation
like phi of x, y equals 0,",00:05:35.580,00:05:42.570
"or phi of x, y equal 1,
or phi of x, y equals 7.",00:05:42.570,00:05:46.470
"Those three curves would
be level sets of phi.",00:05:46.470,00:05:53.870
"Do you see the idea
of levels sets?",00:05:53.870,00:05:56.270
"They're the solutions
to the equation",00:05:56.270,00:05:59.760
"phi of x, y equal constant.",00:05:59.760,00:06:01.480
"Let me take a simple example
here on the board that I can --",00:06:01.480,00:06:08.220
"so the idea of level
sets, first of all.",00:06:08.220,00:06:13.370
"Let me take an easy -- a
particularly nice function.",00:06:13.370,00:06:16.840
"phi of x, y equals, say,
x squared plus y squared.",00:06:16.840,00:06:22.200
"OK, so I want to ask,
what are the level",00:06:22.200,00:06:27.660
sets of that function?,00:06:27.660,00:06:29.980
"So I set phi of x, y equals a
constant, to get the c level",00:06:29.980,00:06:36.550
"set, you could say.",00:06:36.550,00:06:38.360
"And, of course,
we recognize that",00:06:38.360,00:06:39.920
"as a circle when c is
positive, and there",00:06:39.920,00:06:43.580
is no set when c is negative.,00:06:43.580,00:06:45.970
"So this would be -- the
level sets would be circles.",00:06:45.970,00:06:50.360
"So that would be
one description.",00:06:59.140,00:07:00.590
"I mean, what we're
really doing is",00:07:00.590,00:07:02.690
"we're introducing a new
dimension to the problem.",00:07:02.690,00:07:09.930
"Here, it's a 2D problem
with x square and y squared,",00:07:09.930,00:07:13.940
"but I'm bringing in
the third dimension, z,",00:07:13.940,00:07:18.860
"and thinking of the curve in
the xy-plane as being produced",00:07:18.860,00:07:25.310
"by -- so what would be the graph
of z equals x squared plus y",00:07:25.310,00:07:29.290
squared?,00:07:29.290,00:07:29.790
That's some surface now in 3D.,00:07:29.790,00:07:32.530
"So I have x, y, and now I've
introduced this third dimension",00:07:32.530,00:07:40.390
in order to see a whole surface.,00:07:40.390,00:07:43.880
"And now I cut that surface
by the plane z equal to c.",00:07:43.880,00:07:49.160
"So z equal to c cuts through
that surface by a plane here.",00:07:49.160,00:07:56.280
"And that cuts out
a circle, which",00:07:56.280,00:08:00.030
"I can drop down to the xy-plane
if I want to see it down there,",00:08:00.030,00:08:05.180
"and that's the level
set at height c.",00:08:05.180,00:08:08.500
"So that's a way to describe
the curve, but it's sort of --",00:08:11.120,00:08:18.690
it's implicit.,00:08:18.690,00:08:20.950
"You'll see that it has
major advantages when --",00:08:20.950,00:08:24.780
"maybe I can just describe
them without drawing them.",00:08:24.780,00:08:28.250
"Suppose I have a
problem with two fires,",00:08:28.250,00:08:36.820
"say, two circles
of fire, spreading.",00:08:36.820,00:08:40.560
"What's going to happen,
as time evolves,",00:08:40.560,00:08:43.380
with these two circles of fire?,00:08:43.380,00:08:45.470
"Well, having taken circles,
they're just going to expand,",00:08:45.470,00:08:50.490
"so after a little time,
I've got two bigger circles.",00:08:50.490,00:08:55.350
"But after a little
more time, the circles",00:08:55.350,00:08:58.790
"will meet and form
one non-circle, right?",00:08:58.790,00:09:03.110
A sort of figure-eight shape.,00:09:03.110,00:09:09.360
"Now that's a change in
topology, and the world",00:09:09.360,00:09:13.260
"of shape calculations
is always having",00:09:13.260,00:09:17.420
"to ask, how am I going to
deal with changes in topology",00:09:17.420,00:09:20.450
"when curves meet, when
unconnected things become",00:09:20.450,00:09:25.340
"connected, or when
connected things disconnect?",00:09:25.340,00:09:28.740
"And the one great value
of the level set approach",00:09:28.740,00:09:32.495
is it deals with that easily.,00:09:32.495,00:09:35.860
"I could imagine a double -- so
I don't know that I'll succeed",00:09:35.860,00:09:39.930
"to do it here, but I could
imagine a function, which --",00:09:39.930,00:09:47.500
"OK, maybe this example,
this picture, isn't too bad.",00:09:47.500,00:09:52.100
"So that's intended
to be a surface.",00:09:52.100,00:09:54.620
"Well, let me make the
surface go up that way.",00:09:57.250,00:09:59.950
"OK, so when I cut
it at z equals c,",00:09:59.950,00:10:03.210
"that might cut the surface
in two different planes.",00:10:03.210,00:10:08.320
"So the level set at a
certain level is two circles.",00:10:08.320,00:10:14.190
There's two circles.,00:10:14.190,00:10:15.740
"But now, let z increase,
and what happens?",00:10:15.740,00:10:19.550
"You see how naturally,
as z increases,",00:10:19.550,00:10:23.280
"these two circles are
coming closer and closer,",00:10:23.280,00:10:25.550
"and at a certain
point, they merge.",00:10:25.550,00:10:28.980
"And phi of x and y remains
a totally nice function.",00:10:28.980,00:10:35.200
"I mean, I could create some
probably fourth-degree function",00:10:35.200,00:10:40.030
curve that would do that fine.,00:10:40.030,00:10:41.500
I could graph it.,00:10:41.500,00:10:42.730
I could visualize it.,00:10:42.730,00:10:44.500
"And the point is that by
going up that one dimension",00:10:44.500,00:10:47.430
"and then slicing at
different levels,",00:10:47.430,00:10:50.580
"you allow these things
to happen smoothly.",00:10:50.580,00:10:56.070
"OK, so that's one feature of
level sets, that description.",00:10:56.070,00:11:00.300
"OK, so that's the way curves
are going to be defined.",00:11:00.300,00:11:06.170
"So our unknown
becomes this function,",00:11:06.170,00:11:09.280
"which will become a
function of x, y, and t",00:11:09.280,00:11:12.920
with some initial condition.,00:11:12.920,00:11:15.840
"OK, so now, let me
evolve the curve.",00:11:15.840,00:11:24.390
"Well, OK, yeah, let
me evolve a curve.",00:11:24.390,00:11:29.010
"So we already took the case
of a circle, which just grows,",00:11:29.010,00:11:35.470
and that's a piece of it.,00:11:35.470,00:11:38.040
"Let me do a couple more
example so that you see --",00:11:38.040,00:11:42.780
how does a corner evolve?,00:11:42.780,00:11:47.430
"Suppose that's at t equals
0, we have a corner.",00:11:47.430,00:11:50.250
"We have sort of a fire in
here, and it's growing outward.",00:11:52.800,00:11:57.980
"And we're looking for all
the points at distance 1",00:11:57.980,00:12:02.010
from this curve.,00:12:02.010,00:12:02.980
This is our curve at time 0.,00:12:02.980,00:12:05.370
"OK, what do the points
look like at time 1?",00:12:05.370,00:12:09.370
"Well, these points here
will certainly be a distance",00:12:09.370,00:12:14.210
1 away from our curve.,00:12:14.210,00:12:16.050
"These points here will be a
distance 1 away from our curve.",00:12:16.050,00:12:19.930
"But then there's a little
circular arc, right --",00:12:19.930,00:12:24.820
"maybe I should make
that dashed line, too --",00:12:24.820,00:12:27.780
"which are additional
points at distance 1.",00:12:27.780,00:12:34.770
"So in this case, the evolving
curve has smoothed out.",00:12:34.770,00:12:41.490
"That corner, which we might
describe as a jump in the slope",00:12:41.490,00:12:48.110
"if we were thinking about jumps
from the last week's topic,",00:12:48.110,00:12:54.800
"has -- well, I guess
I'd use the word fan.",00:12:54.800,00:12:58.770
"That jump in slope has -- sort
of the characteristics or some",00:12:58.770,00:13:05.280
"key lines here, and here was an
area where none of these lines",00:13:05.280,00:13:12.520
"are matching, but we
have distance 1 still.",00:13:12.520,00:13:16.100
"Somehow, the equation is --
the slope is becoming smooth,",00:13:18.970,00:13:27.630
which it wasn't initially.,00:13:27.630,00:13:29.830
"Now the opposite
could also happen.",00:13:29.830,00:13:34.610
"A corner could appear
from a smooth start.",00:13:34.610,00:13:41.360
"So that would correspond,
of course, in our thinking.",00:13:41.360,00:13:45.000
"We immediately
think, oh, we started",00:13:45.000,00:13:47.780
"with something smooth,
evolved for a little while,",00:13:47.780,00:13:51.460
and a shock appeared.,00:13:51.460,00:13:52.930
"So a shock would
correspond to the --",00:13:52.930,00:13:55.740
"it's a shock in the
slope, so to speak.",00:13:55.740,00:13:58.450
"So the curve itself
will be continuous.",00:13:58.450,00:14:01.200
"Let me take it -- well, let
me just take it straight.",00:14:01.200,00:14:04.020
I mean -- oops!,00:14:04.020,00:14:05.860
"Well, I was hoping
to make it tangent,",00:14:05.860,00:14:08.000
"so let me make it more obviously
tangent, so a little --",00:14:08.000,00:14:11.580
"maybe an arc of a
circle or something,",00:14:11.580,00:14:13.670
"and then straight again, just
as a model that you can see",00:14:13.670,00:14:17.890
what's happening.,00:14:17.890,00:14:19.400
"OK, what will happen now?",00:14:19.400,00:14:22.080
So that's again t equals 0.,00:14:22.080,00:14:23.920
"So that, you see, has
-- these are now --",00:14:26.650,00:14:36.320
"the fire is moving
normal to the surface,",00:14:36.320,00:14:42.700
normal to the fire front.,00:14:42.700,00:14:44.690
"And you see what happens now
is, after a certain time,",00:14:44.690,00:14:49.740
"say t equal to 1, we're going
to have a corner appear.",00:14:49.740,00:14:55.980
This'll get steeper and steeper.,00:14:55.980,00:15:03.820
"The slope will change
faster and faster.",00:15:03.820,00:15:05.970
"Here it takes a little while
to change from that slope.",00:15:05.970,00:15:08.810
"It curves around and
slowly gets to that slope.",00:15:08.810,00:15:12.130
"But that is going to get
squeezed in as we move forward",00:15:12.130,00:15:16.070
"in time and -- well, it's
essentially time running",00:15:16.070,00:15:21.530
"in the opposite
direction from this box.",00:15:21.530,00:15:24.780
"So this would be at t
equal to 1, with a corner.",00:15:24.780,00:15:28.550
"OK, and maybe those examples
will explain why the idea",00:15:31.140,00:15:39.840
"of a particle method isn't great
because if we put particles --",00:15:39.840,00:15:46.400
I'll just say that again.,00:15:46.400,00:15:47.760
"If we tried to
follow this, which",00:15:47.760,00:15:51.430
"would be a completely
natural idea in discretizing",00:15:51.430,00:15:55.200
"the differential problem, would
be to follow particles there.",00:15:55.200,00:16:00.180
"They travel perpendicular
to the fire.",00:16:00.180,00:16:06.000
"They reach here and here,
but nobody reaches there,",00:16:06.000,00:16:10.070
"so we don't have any
information there.",00:16:10.070,00:16:13.520
"And if we did try the
particle method here,",00:16:13.520,00:16:16.920
"we'd have a bunch of particles
that start following the law",00:16:16.920,00:16:24.080
"of moving -- well, we have to
figure out where the tangent",00:16:24.080,00:16:28.590
"direction is, and perpendicular
to that is the normal",00:16:28.590,00:16:31.701
direction.,00:16:31.701,00:16:32.200
"The particles move
along, and you",00:16:32.200,00:16:33.970
"see that all these
particles are going",00:16:33.970,00:16:35.595
"to be really close together
after a little time,",00:16:35.595,00:16:40.850
"and then there, they meet.",00:16:40.850,00:16:45.460
"So the particle method
just basically fails",00:16:45.460,00:16:49.340
on a problem like this.,00:16:49.340,00:16:51.180
"On a problem that stays
beautiful and smooth and keeps",00:16:51.180,00:16:55.570
"it shape, probably
the particle --",00:16:55.570,00:16:58.460
"the following ordinary
differential equation for each",00:16:58.460,00:17:01.670
"particle and then interpolating
to find a curve is reasonable.",00:17:01.670,00:17:05.430
"But level set method
is a different way.",00:17:05.430,00:17:09.790
"OK, so let me stay with the
level set idea, which involves,",00:17:09.790,00:17:17.510
"of course, remembering if
this is the curve phi of x, y",00:17:17.510,00:17:25.990
"equals 0, then the
normal direction",00:17:25.990,00:17:29.990
"is the same direction
as the gradient.",00:17:29.990,00:17:32.510
"I mean, that's the
one bit of calculus",00:17:32.510,00:17:34.680
"that we absolutely need, is
that the gradient of a function",00:17:34.680,00:17:38.370
points in the normal direction.,00:17:38.370,00:17:42.020
"And if we want a unit vector
n, the unit normal vector,",00:17:42.020,00:17:45.920
we have to divide by its length.,00:17:45.920,00:17:49.280
"So that's the basic formula
from calculus of two variables.",00:17:49.280,00:17:57.930
"And then there's a
special case of a function",00:17:57.930,00:18:01.980
when the gradient is 1.,00:18:01.980,00:18:04.840
"So we have -- that
formula simplifies",00:18:04.840,00:18:07.950
"because the denominator is
just a 1 for these functions.",00:18:07.950,00:18:11.310
"OK, so these are
distance functions.",00:18:11.310,00:18:14.190
"Functions with
gradient everywhere 1",00:18:14.190,00:18:16.690
"are kind of special and
nice, very special and nice.",00:18:16.690,00:18:21.050
"And I guess that
if everything is --",00:18:21.050,00:18:24.860
"so I spoke about
distance function here.",00:18:24.860,00:18:26.960
"So I allowed myself to take --
to imagine that the function",00:18:26.960,00:18:31.880
"phi was the distance, that
everything was traveling with",00:18:31.880,00:18:35.280
speed F equal 1.,00:18:35.280,00:18:37.330
"So let me introduce that
letter F for the speed,",00:18:37.330,00:18:43.250
"and in this case, it's 1.",00:18:43.250,00:18:45.420
"So at time t -- the function
that gives the distance has",00:18:45.420,00:18:51.620
gradient 1.,00:18:51.620,00:18:52.310
Maybe an example would serve.,00:18:52.310,00:18:54.570
"Let me go back to
this circle here.",00:18:54.570,00:18:59.250
"OK, suppose these are my -- I'm
not doing this tricky case with",00:18:59.250,00:19:06.630
"two circles, but just
back to a single circle.",00:19:06.630,00:19:09.160
"So if I take the gradient
of that function, I get --",00:19:11.690,00:19:18.000
"it's a vector, right?",00:19:18.000,00:19:19.380
"The x-derivative and then the
y-derivative, it's 2x and 2y.",00:19:19.380,00:19:24.910
"And that's a vector
with some magnitude.",00:19:24.910,00:19:28.980
"Probably the
magnitude is about 2r,",00:19:28.980,00:19:30.890
the distance from the center.,00:19:30.890,00:19:33.310
It's not 1.,00:19:33.310,00:19:34.170
This is not a distance function.,00:19:34.170,00:19:37.320
"The distance function that
has the same level curves",00:19:37.320,00:19:41.510
"but has gradient
equal 1 would just",00:19:41.510,00:19:44.260
"be the square root of x
squared plus y squared.",00:19:44.260,00:19:48.850
That's a distance.,00:19:48.850,00:19:51.430
"OK, so that distance
function -- say,",00:19:51.430,00:19:54.930
"and let me measure
distance from the center.",00:19:54.930,00:19:58.070
"OK, so the distance
from the origin",00:19:58.070,00:20:01.390
"is 0, when x and y are 0.",00:20:01.390,00:20:04.480
"I claim that this
distance function is --",00:20:04.480,00:20:08.840
"that that function is this
perfect kind for the level set",00:20:08.840,00:20:14.080
"method where its level sets
are still those same circles,",00:20:14.080,00:20:18.400
"but the gradient of that
thing, the gradient of this --",00:20:18.400,00:20:23.140
"of course, this is just r.",00:20:23.140,00:20:25.860
"And the gradient of it, if I
take the x-derivative of this",00:20:25.860,00:20:31.545
"-- so let me take the
gradient of the distance,",00:20:31.545,00:20:35.970
"just in case you were really
remembering what we easily",00:20:35.970,00:20:41.940
"mastered in calculus
of several variables.",00:20:41.940,00:20:48.340
"The x-derivative of
that is, well, I get 2x,",00:20:48.340,00:20:53.740
"and then I get a half
from the square root,",00:20:53.740,00:20:55.770
"and then the square root
goes in the denominator.",00:20:55.770,00:20:57.970
"So that's just x over r, x over
the square root, if you like.",00:20:57.970,00:21:03.990
"x over the square root
is the first component.",00:21:03.990,00:21:07.980
That's the x-derivative.,00:21:07.980,00:21:09.760
"The y-derivative of this
is 2y from the chain rule,",00:21:09.760,00:21:15.980
"and then the whole square
root produces 1/2 square root",00:21:15.980,00:21:21.080
"to the -- square root
in the denominator.",00:21:21.080,00:21:23.630
"In other words, it produces
y over the square root.",00:21:23.630,00:21:28.400
"And sure enough -- so that's
the gradient and sure enough,",00:21:28.400,00:21:32.520
"if I take its magnitude, I take
this squared plus this squared,",00:21:32.520,00:21:39.090
"square root, but I get 1.",00:21:39.090,00:21:42.660
"OK, so distance functions
are the good ones.",00:21:42.660,00:21:47.420
"So in working with
the level set method,",00:21:47.420,00:21:51.190
"we will follow equations,
numerically, of course,",00:21:51.190,00:21:59.110
"and phi of x and y
might start out --",00:21:59.110,00:22:03.050
"phi of x and y and 0 might
be a distance function,",00:22:03.050,00:22:08.820
"but later on in time
after we've followed phi,",00:22:08.820,00:22:13.670
"it probably changes from
a distance function.",00:22:13.670,00:22:15.900
"And if it changes a lot, if its
gradient is getting out of hand",00:22:15.900,00:22:21.330
"-- for example, the gradient
of this is getting bigger.",00:22:21.330,00:22:27.220
"And after a while, we can
stop, reinitialize to make",00:22:29.780,00:22:36.980
the gradient 1 again.,00:22:36.980,00:22:38.790
"Effectively, we would come back
to this function and proceed.",00:22:38.790,00:22:43.210
"So this reinitialization is part
of the numerical computation",00:22:45.810,00:22:51.220
that I won't say more about.,00:22:51.220,00:22:53.060
"Really what I now have to do
is say what's the key equation?",00:22:53.060,00:23:00.170
"What's the equation that we
solve numerically in x, y, t?",00:23:00.170,00:23:04.000
"Remember, it's going to be a
partial differential equation.",00:23:04.000,00:23:11.050
"OK, so first we
have to know what's",00:23:11.050,00:23:14.040
"the rule for the
evolution of a curve.",00:23:14.040,00:23:18.360
"So this decides the
movement of the curve.",00:23:18.360,00:23:22.710
"This decides the movement
of the curve, this velocity",00:23:22.710,00:23:30.640
"vector, velocity field,
velocity vector, v, (v_1, v_2).",00:23:30.640,00:23:36.877
It's a vector.,00:23:36.877,00:23:37.460
"All right, then
the neat thing is",00:23:41.330,00:23:44.680
"that we get, by using this level
set description of the curve,",00:23:44.680,00:23:51.810
to this equation.,00:23:51.810,00:23:54.750
"The convection
equation, you could say.",00:23:54.750,00:23:56.470
"It's like our one-way
wave equation.",00:23:56.470,00:23:59.230
"If v is a constant,
it's just our equation,",00:23:59.230,00:24:03.950
"but now we're in
two space dimensions",00:24:03.950,00:24:07.740
"instead, where before,
we were just in one.",00:24:07.740,00:24:10.760
"But if v is not a constant,
then, for example,",00:24:10.760,00:24:15.990
v may depend on phi.,00:24:15.990,00:24:19.860
"The velocity might
depend, and it often",00:24:19.860,00:24:22.230
"does depend on the curvature of
phi in some nonlinear problem,",00:24:22.230,00:24:29.010
"then our equation
becomes nonlinear,",00:24:29.010,00:24:32.000
but it still has a nice form.,00:24:32.000,00:24:34.880
"So that expresses exactly what
our thinking is that the level",00:24:34.880,00:24:40.280
"sets -- that the function,
the evolution of the function,",00:24:40.280,00:24:45.440
"tells us how the level sets
evolve, and then, at any time,",00:24:45.440,00:24:51.410
"we read off the position of
the curve from the level set.",00:24:51.410,00:24:55.760
"And then one more
step to that equation,",00:24:55.760,00:25:01.440
"which is often easier
computationally than this one.",00:25:01.440,00:25:06.550
"So I'm going to take a
simple step between there",00:25:06.550,00:25:09.300
"and there in the case when v
is in the normal direction.",00:25:09.300,00:25:22.270
"So let me look at
this v dot grad phi",00:25:22.270,00:25:28.160
"that came into the
convection equation.",00:25:28.160,00:25:30.180
"I'll divide and multiply by
the magnitude of the gradient,",00:25:30.180,00:25:36.050
"and then I recognize this
as the normal vector.",00:25:36.050,00:25:39.160
I recognize that as n.,00:25:39.160,00:25:41.250
"So this is v dot n, and I'm
going to give a name to v dot n",00:25:41.250,00:25:46.160
"and call it F. That's the speed,
speed in the normal direction,",00:25:46.160,00:25:50.790
v dot n.,00:25:50.790,00:25:52.290
"And then there's
this factor magnitude",00:25:52.290,00:25:54.740
of grad phi coming along.,00:25:54.740,00:25:57.590
"OK, so that's the equation.",00:25:57.590,00:25:59.510
"That's sort of the
famous level set equation",00:25:59.510,00:26:03.410
"where, if F is a
constant, that's the case",00:26:03.410,00:26:05.990
"we're speaking about
of a fire moving.",00:26:05.990,00:26:09.510
"But if F depends on the --
F could be a function of --",00:26:09.510,00:26:13.940
"if I put parentheses in there, F
could be a function of gradient",00:26:13.940,00:26:18.270
"phi, a more
complicated function.",00:26:18.270,00:26:22.650
"For example, I wrote down,
because I would otherwise",00:26:22.650,00:26:26.540
"forget, this could be our --
this is a possible F of grad",00:26:26.540,00:26:36.690
phi.,00:26:36.690,00:26:39.680
"Actually, it depends on
more than the magnitude",00:26:39.680,00:26:42.730
so I'd better -- yeah.,00:26:42.730,00:26:48.140
"And certainly not a linear one
because of that denominator.",00:26:48.140,00:26:53.070
"So a big set of examples in
this subject, not linear,",00:26:53.070,00:26:59.890
are curvature shapes.,00:26:59.890,00:27:03.940
"Actually, the curvature
problem is quite interesting.",00:27:03.940,00:27:06.950
"If the movement depends
on the curvature --",00:27:06.950,00:27:11.240
"so suppose I start with an
elliptical-looking shape,",00:27:11.240,00:27:17.690
"the curvature is
smaller here, right?",00:27:17.690,00:27:21.320
"Oh, I'm sorry, smaller curvature
there, larger curvature there,",00:27:21.320,00:27:26.600
"and if we choose
the right evolution,",00:27:26.600,00:27:32.640
"often it will come -- maybe this
is a case where the movement is",00:27:32.640,00:27:37.200
"inward because the curvature is
somehow the appropriate vectors",00:27:37.200,00:27:46.770
pointing in.,00:27:46.770,00:27:48.010
"Here it would move in slowly
because the curvature is small.",00:27:48.010,00:27:52.060
"Here it would move in faster
because the curvature is",00:27:52.060,00:27:54.710
larger.,00:27:54.710,00:27:57.280
"The curvature is
tending to even out.",00:27:57.280,00:27:59.270
"And, in fact, after a certain
-- as time goes on, any shape",00:27:59.270,00:28:03.850
"approaches a circle, and the
circle shrinks and shrinks",00:28:03.850,00:28:07.960
and disappears.,00:28:07.960,00:28:09.390
"So that this class of --
this sort of nonlinear group",00:28:09.390,00:28:15.000
"of problems has a nice
geometric picture,",00:28:15.000,00:28:18.560
"that whatever shape
you begin with,",00:28:18.560,00:28:21.550
"you could even begin with
a really weird shape like",00:28:21.550,00:28:25.150
a barbell or something.,00:28:25.150,00:28:29.840
So this has zero curvature.,00:28:29.840,00:28:31.580
It wouldn't move at the start.,00:28:31.580,00:28:34.570
"This would move in, so
after a little while",00:28:34.570,00:28:38.410
"it would be like this, then
the corner would move in.",00:28:38.410,00:28:43.950
"So it seems a little unlikely
it's true that after a while,",00:28:43.950,00:28:48.800
"the shape would become
nearly circular,",00:28:48.800,00:28:50.780
"get smaller and smaller,
and the shape would vanish.",00:28:50.780,00:28:54.020
"Anyway, that a
curvature problem.",00:28:54.020,00:28:56.580
"OK, so I guess following
the main theme of the course",00:28:56.580,00:29:04.020
"would be write down a finite
difference method for the level",00:29:04.020,00:29:10.370
set equation.,00:29:10.370,00:29:12.580
That's the natural thing to do.,00:29:12.580,00:29:14.220
"Write down a finite
difference method",00:29:14.220,00:29:15.800
for the level set equation.,00:29:15.800,00:29:17.440
Solve that numerically.,00:29:17.440,00:29:18.940
"So that would be
on the web page.",00:29:18.940,00:29:21.500
"The difference
equation is going to be",00:29:21.500,00:29:23.280
"a sort of upwind
equation, but it's",00:29:23.280,00:29:28.820
"a little messier
in two variables",00:29:28.820,00:29:32.740
to write out in detail here.,00:29:32.740,00:29:36.820
You'll see it there on the web.,00:29:36.820,00:29:38.720
"OK, so you solve it,
and proceed in time,",00:29:38.720,00:29:44.650
"and reinitialize when necessary
or when it seems advisable,",00:29:44.650,00:29:50.420
"and you get a great
picture of this evolving,",00:29:50.420,00:29:54.340
moving interface.,00:29:54.340,00:29:57.010
So problems of that kind.,00:29:57.010,00:29:58.880
Or optimizing the interface.,00:29:58.880,00:30:01.300
"There are other problems
where you might --",00:30:01.300,00:30:04.070
"ones on the web where--
you might be, look,",00:30:04.070,00:30:06.810
the unknown might be a shape.,00:30:06.810,00:30:09.380
"And you're looking
for the shape that",00:30:09.380,00:30:11.510
"maybe makes an eigenvalue as
small as possible, subject",00:30:11.510,00:30:16.400
to some constraint.,00:30:16.400,00:30:17.650
So problems for shapes.,00:30:17.650,00:30:21.460
"That's really the
type of problem",00:30:21.460,00:30:24.080
"that level set methods
are created for.",00:30:24.080,00:30:27.900
"OK, and these example show
the connection -- actually,",00:30:27.900,00:30:35.790
"somehow the -- yeah, it's really
that if I tried to connect it",00:30:35.790,00:30:40.000
"to conservation laws, to
the previous lectures,",00:30:40.000,00:30:47.160
"this is our earlier guy,
would be -- in one variable,",00:30:47.160,00:30:58.880
"let's say, this would correspond
to the derivative of maybe phi",00:30:58.880,00:31:06.250
"or capital U. So the
conservation laws for little u",00:31:06.250,00:31:12.550
"correspond to equations
like this for phi.",00:31:12.550,00:31:16.150
"Well, or really, grad
phi in more dimensions.",00:31:19.480,00:31:29.070
"OK, well, all right.",00:31:32.020,00:31:35.040
"So what else remains to
say about this topic?",00:31:35.040,00:31:39.480
"Really, I guess my main
point is to introduce you",00:31:39.480,00:31:43.400
"to the idea of level sets
and level set method for when",00:31:43.400,00:31:48.540
"problems of moving interfaces
and shape optimization come up.",00:31:48.540,00:31:54.390
"I guess I also wanted
to say something",00:31:58.330,00:32:00.620
about this fast marching method.,00:32:00.620,00:32:02.940
"OK, so what's that?",00:32:02.940,00:32:06.710
"That's a case where there's
a very fast solution",00:32:06.710,00:32:10.640
to this problem.,00:32:10.640,00:32:14.250
"And that case occurs when
the wave front is always",00:32:14.250,00:32:19.030
"moving the same way, when
the F holds its sign.",00:32:19.030,00:32:26.530
So it would apply here.,00:32:26.530,00:32:28.170
"So I could use the
fast marching method.",00:32:28.170,00:32:30.650
"Rather than the
level set equation",00:32:30.650,00:32:34.410
"and a finite difference
method for it,",00:32:34.410,00:32:36.370
"I could use a fast marching
method for this problem",00:32:36.370,00:32:40.210
"because I have no danger
of the shape turning,",00:32:40.210,00:32:47.160
"changing direction,
coming back in on itself,",00:32:47.160,00:32:49.950
"all the crazy things
that can happen,",00:32:49.950,00:32:53.880
"the things that are
illustrated on the web.",00:32:53.880,00:32:57.710
"OK, so the fast marching
method, well, maybe I --",00:32:57.710,00:33:02.900
"so what's the problem
in that nice case?",00:33:02.900,00:33:06.010
"I want to find -- I
could put on a mesh.",00:33:09.070,00:33:15.350
"Yeah, let me take as a problem
the computation of the distance",00:33:15.350,00:33:19.120
function from this curve.,00:33:19.120,00:33:22.720
"OK, so I could create a mesh.",00:33:22.720,00:33:25.340
"So I'm going to take that
problem and turn it into a --",00:33:25.340,00:33:34.090
"discretize it in a natural
way, and I'm searching",00:33:34.090,00:33:42.660
for the distance function.,00:33:42.660,00:33:44.210
"So d of x and y is the distance
that I now want to compute.",00:33:44.210,00:33:51.010
"It's the distance
from the curve C.",00:33:51.010,00:33:55.790
"And let me make it a
signed distance function",00:33:55.790,00:33:58.150
"so I'll make d negative in
here and positive outside",00:33:58.150,00:34:03.320
of the curve.,00:34:03.320,00:34:05.340
OK.,00:34:05.340,00:34:05.840
"All right, so the
idea is we could --",00:34:10.750,00:34:14.900
"this fits our level set picture,
but there's a direct way to do",00:34:14.900,00:34:25.112
it.,00:34:25.112,00:34:27.370
"And it's a nice -- it's
an algorithm that computer",00:34:27.370,00:34:31.210
"scientists probably created
and appreciate, that --",00:34:31.210,00:34:35.080
we want to know the distance.,00:34:35.080,00:34:37.680
"We want to compute d
at the mesh points.",00:34:37.680,00:34:40.640
Let me put another mesh point.,00:34:40.640,00:34:42.690
"OK, so how do I --
so the question is,",00:34:42.690,00:34:47.120
"how do I get from -- let me
put another y in there, too,",00:34:47.120,00:34:53.240
"and that created
some more points.",00:34:53.240,00:34:56.140
"So how to -- what
path -- you know,",00:34:56.140,00:35:02.830
"how to get the distance from
the curve to each mesh point?",00:35:02.830,00:35:07.990
"Well, here's the idea,
just in a nutshell.",00:35:07.990,00:35:11.450
"You keep a list of
tentative distances",00:35:11.450,00:35:18.000
"to all the mesh
points, and you look",00:35:18.000,00:35:20.330
"for the one that's closest, like
it's probably maybe that guy.",00:35:20.330,00:35:27.280
"So maybe that's right
on the curve, let's say.",00:35:27.280,00:35:30.660
"So the idea is I can
-- that will be --",00:35:30.660,00:35:37.880
"to get to this point, I'm
never going to take a path that",00:35:37.880,00:35:42.460
passes through the others.,00:35:42.460,00:35:45.010
"To get here, I might
take a path that",00:35:45.010,00:35:47.630
goes through an earlier point.,00:35:47.630,00:35:49.990
"But the nearest point,
the work is done.",00:35:49.990,00:35:54.740
"So you successively sweep
through the mesh points,",00:35:54.740,00:36:00.990
"pick the one whose current
distance, tentative distance,",00:36:00.990,00:36:05.970
"is the smallest, and you
say that is the distance.",00:36:05.970,00:36:09.150
That's the right number.,00:36:09.150,00:36:11.310
"Then now you know how far
it is to get to that point.",00:36:11.310,00:36:15.350
"So now you could, if you had
to, update all the previous --",00:36:15.350,00:36:20.230
"all the other distances by
knowing the correct one,",00:36:20.230,00:36:24.270
"how distant it is, how
distant that point is.",00:36:24.270,00:36:30.230
"OK, so then that one's settled.",00:36:30.230,00:36:32.270
"Now you look at your
list, your updated list.",00:36:32.270,00:36:36.510
"You pick the smallest one in
that, the closest one in that.",00:36:36.510,00:36:40.860
"You found the best way
because things are never",00:36:40.860,00:36:44.870
"going to reverse in
sign; you're never",00:36:44.870,00:36:46.630
"going to travel
out and come back.",00:36:46.630,00:36:49.420
"So the closest
one, you've got it.",00:36:49.420,00:36:52.660
"So that might be
this or something,",00:36:52.660,00:36:55.140
"and then we would update how
far it takes to get to those.",00:36:55.140,00:36:58.640
"So that fast marching
method is a, you might say,",00:36:58.640,00:37:03.840
"fairly natural idea of how
to compute distances when",00:37:03.840,00:37:12.020
"everything is measured, when our
problem is -- has a fixed sign.",00:37:12.020,00:37:20.560
"OK, so that's my short comment
on the fast marching method.",00:37:20.560,00:37:25.310
"My longer comment is on the
level set method and level set",00:37:25.310,00:37:30.310
"equation, where I
haven't written out",00:37:30.310,00:37:32.600
"the finite difference
approximation that people",00:37:32.600,00:37:37.350
"typically use, and
note on the web.",00:37:37.350,00:37:44.500
"All right, so that's level
sets, which I probably",00:37:44.500,00:37:48.500
will not come back to.,00:37:48.500,00:37:51.140
It's kind of a one-shot lecture.,00:37:51.140,00:37:52.720
"So let me take
the remaining time",00:37:56.570,00:37:58.570
to get feedback on the homework.,00:37:58.570,00:38:05.190
"So were there four problems,
possible candidate problems,",00:38:05.190,00:38:08.510
for homework?,00:38:08.510,00:38:09.280
Let me put those down again.,00:38:09.280,00:38:11.740
"I'm just going to ask first,
who did which problem.",00:38:11.740,00:38:15.570
"So the first problem was
the conservation law -- no,",00:38:15.570,00:38:19.640
"was the one-way-- OK, remind me.",00:38:19.640,00:38:23.790
"I don't remember
the order I gave.",00:38:23.790,00:38:27.560
"So was Number 4 the
conservation law?",00:38:27.560,00:38:29.590
The nonlinear one?,00:38:29.590,00:38:30.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:38:30.610,00:38:31.190
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.",00:38:31.190,00:38:32.030
So the conservation law.,00:38:32.030,00:38:33.430
"I'll just write down
u_t plus u*u_x equals 0.",00:38:33.430,00:38:38.300
"Oh yeah, Number 1 was the basic
question of u_t equals c*u_x.",00:38:38.300,00:38:42.540
"Yeah, that's right.",00:38:49.179,00:38:49.970
"So that's a very important
and not too obvious",00:38:49.970,00:38:53.430
"question, a good numerical
question, of what to do.",00:38:53.430,00:38:56.450
"And Number 2 was the wave
equation; was that right?",00:38:56.450,00:38:59.320
AUDIENCE: Schrodinger's.,00:38:59.320,00:39:01.042
"PROFESSOR:
Schrodinger's, Number 2.",00:39:01.042,00:39:02.500
"Oh, boy.",00:39:02.500,00:39:03.110
OK.,00:39:03.110,00:39:03.880
"So i*u_xx, which I haven't
discussed in class and I had --",00:39:03.880,00:39:10.000
"the good question came up, how
do you deal with these complex",00:39:10.000,00:39:13.630
"numbers because, of course,
it's going to get complex right",00:39:13.630,00:39:16.600
away.,00:39:16.600,00:39:17.510
"Well, one way that
just occurs to me",00:39:17.510,00:39:19.700
"is take the real
and imaginary parts",00:39:19.700,00:39:22.320
"so that we get two equations,
two real equations.",00:39:22.320,00:39:25.390
"PROFESSOR: OK, Number 3
was -- what did I have --",00:39:25.390,00:39:30.344
AUDIENCE: The wave equation.,00:39:30.344,00:39:31.510
"PROFESSOR: Was
the wave equation?",00:39:31.510,00:39:32.940
"OK, second order?",00:39:32.940,00:39:34.040
AUDIENCE: First order.,00:39:34.040,00:39:37.200

first-order wave equation?",00:39:37.200,00:39:40.940
"Oh, OK.",00:39:40.940,00:39:43.200
"So what was I -- OK, first-order
wave equation like so.",00:39:43.200,00:39:46.380
I'm sorry?,00:39:50.910,00:39:51.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:51.410,00:39:53.680
"PROFESSOR: c*u_x, OK, yep.",00:39:53.680,00:39:56.370
"All right, so was the question
there to go back to the--",00:39:56.370,00:40:00.430
AUDIENCE: Compare.,00:40:00.430,00:40:01.680
"PROFESSOR: Compare, right.",00:40:01.680,00:40:02.830
"Compare the methods we've
already established.",00:40:02.830,00:40:05.710
"And then Number 4 was to tackle
some case of nonlinear equation",00:40:08.450,00:40:14.900
"where shocks and
fans could appear.",00:40:14.900,00:40:19.390
"OK, maybe I just get a
sense of who did what.",00:40:19.390,00:40:23.690
Number 1 how many?,00:40:23.690,00:40:25.480
Wow!,00:40:25.480,00:40:26.220
"Number 1 was popular and
I think it's justified.",00:40:26.220,00:40:30.980
"So this is certainly
the biggest choice.",00:40:30.980,00:40:35.770
"So let me come back and get some
ideas of what you concluded.",00:40:35.770,00:40:41.780
"Number 2, did anybody
tackle Schrodinger?",00:40:41.780,00:40:43.780
Yes.,00:40:43.780,00:40:44.430
A couple of complex guys.,00:40:44.430,00:40:45.857
"Well, I know you asked about it.",00:40:45.857,00:40:47.190
"Yep, OK, good.",00:40:47.190,00:40:49.660
Anybody go back to these?,00:40:49.660,00:40:51.760
For this?,00:40:51.760,00:40:52.700
You did?,00:40:52.700,00:40:53.290
"OK, you may have done
a little bit of both.",00:40:53.290,00:40:56.850
"And did anybody venture
to nonlinear world?",00:40:56.850,00:41:01.790
One.,00:41:01.790,00:41:02.350
"Good, OK.",00:41:02.350,00:41:03.610
Nonlinear person.,00:41:03.610,00:41:05.600
"I'm glad to know that, right.",00:41:05.600,00:41:07.920
"So this is like -- this homework
you could think of us as like",00:41:10.920,00:41:13.900
prep for a possible project.,00:41:13.900,00:41:16.710
"Your project could grow
out of this homework,",00:41:16.710,00:41:19.760
"or it could grow from other
things that are coming.",00:41:19.760,00:41:23.800
OK.,00:41:23.800,00:41:24.760
"All right, let's stick with this
one then since a lot of people",00:41:24.760,00:41:28.310
will have input on it.,00:41:28.310,00:41:31.770
"Let me ask -- well, I'll
just ask naive questions",00:41:31.770,00:41:34.900
"because you've actually
done the calculation.",00:41:34.900,00:41:39.600
"Is there a method
you'd recommend?",00:41:39.600,00:41:43.230
"If you had a problem like that
or, I mean, like for real,",00:41:43.230,00:41:48.350
"and you had to invest
in a code and use it,",00:41:48.350,00:41:54.340
just give an opinion.,00:41:54.340,00:41:55.610
Or did you only try one method?,00:41:59.600,00:42:02.030
"Tell me something,

push -- in theory,",00:42:13.340,00:42:15.590
"there's some mike you push and
this will be the first time",00:42:15.590,00:42:18.170
we've ever done it.,00:42:18.170,00:42:19.260
"OK, terrific.",00:42:19.260,00:42:20.260

PROFESSOR: Centered explicit.,00:42:24.922,00:42:26.130
Let me write that down.,00:42:26.130,00:42:27.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:42:27.720,00:42:29.390
"PROFESSOR: OK, right.",00:42:29.390,00:42:30.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:42:30.570,00:42:43.900

PROFESSOR: That's right.,00:42:51.500,00:42:52.500
"So, OK, the centered
explicit one",00:42:52.500,00:42:54.520
"is computing this
from three old values.",00:42:54.520,00:42:58.440
"We certainly need
three because we've",00:42:58.440,00:43:00.130
got a second derivative there.,00:43:00.130,00:43:02.500
"But then we have
a certain amount",00:43:02.500,00:43:04.840
"of that second derivative and
a certain amount of this one,",00:43:04.840,00:43:08.750
"and that can make one of those
three numbers go negative.",00:43:08.750,00:43:12.350
"They always add the one because
the constant is certainly",00:43:12.350,00:43:16.350
a solution we want to keep.,00:43:16.350,00:43:18.460
"OK, so when a coefficient
went negative,",00:43:18.460,00:43:22.540
"that doesn't mean
instability; is that right?",00:43:22.540,00:43:27.580

no trouble with that.",00:43:41.700,00:43:43.940
"Yeah, OK.",00:43:43.940,00:43:45.280

Peclet number, or the cell",00:43:45.280,00:43:48.040

whatever we called it.",00:43:48.040,00:43:50.295

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:44:03.640,00:44:05.500
"PROFESSOR: OK, if you went
-- when you say implicit,",00:44:05.500,00:44:09.210
"it's just the diffusion
term that's going implicit?",00:44:09.210,00:44:12.480
"OK, OK.",00:44:12.480,00:44:15.360
"So that should be a
very stable process,",00:44:15.360,00:44:17.590
"but, of course, now we've
got this term affecting it.",00:44:17.590,00:44:23.640
"So you actually found out
that even the implicit one",00:44:23.640,00:44:27.230
could break?,00:44:27.230,00:44:29.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:44:29.230,00:44:31.344

"PROFESSOR: Even
the implicit one?",00:44:38.980,00:44:40.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:44:40.440,00:44:44.284
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.",00:44:44.284,00:44:45.200
"So on the implicit part -- so
this was method one and this",00:44:45.200,00:44:49.910
"was method two, implicit
for the diffusion,",00:44:49.910,00:44:53.550
"but you found that that
could still be unstable.",00:44:53.550,00:45:00.200
"OK, yeah.",00:45:00.200,00:45:01.830
Anybody else do this comparison?,00:45:01.830,00:45:05.870
"Can you push your
mike button just to --",00:45:05.870,00:45:10.600
"this is a hotshot room that
we haven't taken advantage",00:45:10.600,00:45:13.280
"of, but it's our chance.",00:45:13.280,00:45:14.409
"AUDIENCE: I actually looked at
the -- when I first did the --",00:45:14.409,00:45:16.950
"looking at just the
growth factors of explicit",00:45:16.950,00:45:21.000
and implicit --,00:45:21.000,00:45:21.780
"PROFESSOR: OK,
looking at that G --",00:45:21.780,00:45:23.900
"AUDIENCE: --on the
convection term as well?",00:45:23.900,00:45:26.034
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:45:26.034,00:45:26.700
"AUDIENCE: And I used implicit
for all the diffusion.",00:45:26.700,00:45:30.060
"And I found the most
stable using upwind,",00:45:30.060,00:45:34.640
"when both were implicit,
the growth factor",00:45:34.640,00:45:37.290
"was actually able
to stay below 1.",00:45:37.290,00:45:39.560
"PROFESSOR: So you moved
the first derivative also",00:45:39.560,00:45:44.420
up to the new time?,00:45:44.420,00:45:45.830
"OK, and that was -- then
you don't have a problem.",00:45:45.830,00:45:47.961
"AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.",00:45:47.961,00:45:48.960
"So stable for pretty
much all big R, little r.",00:45:48.960,00:45:52.870
"But the explicit upwind
for the convection term",00:45:52.870,00:45:55.970
"was stable for most, as long
as the little r was below 0.5.",00:45:55.970,00:46:00.792
PROFESSOR: I see.,00:46:00.792,00:46:01.500
"So the numbers
could tell you the--",00:46:01.500,00:46:03.496
AUDIENCE: Sure.,00:46:03.496,00:46:04.120
"PROFESSOR: --limits
on little r and big R?",00:46:04.120,00:46:06.490
AUDIENCE: Yep.,00:46:06.490,00:46:07.170
"And then I did the
explicit convection",00:46:07.170,00:46:11.180
"upwind with the implicit
centered diffusion,",00:46:11.180,00:46:13.500
"and that seemed to be pretty
stable unless I really started",00:46:13.500,00:46:15.980
cranking the numbers out.,00:46:15.980,00:46:17.132
PROFESSOR: I see.,00:46:17.132,00:46:17.840
"Oh, that's the one
that he had also done?",00:46:17.840,00:46:20.270
AUDIENCE: Yep.,00:46:20.270,00:46:21.260
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.",00:46:21.260,00:46:24.380
"And now, so I guess I remember,
in the figure that isn't yet",00:46:24.380,00:46:31.610
"drawn that might emerge
from your calculations,",00:46:31.610,00:46:34.620
"a possibility where --
depending on the Peclet number,",00:46:34.620,00:46:39.990
where it was stable.,00:46:39.990,00:46:41.750
"It didn't blow up, but
oscillations appeared",00:46:41.750,00:46:44.950
"and the calculations -- you
wouldn't do it even so --",00:46:44.950,00:46:49.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:46:49.580,00:46:50.795
"PROFESSOR: That's
what you meant, yeah.",00:46:50.795,00:46:52.420
"OK, so there are cases
where the method isn't good",00:46:52.420,00:46:58.070
"even though it's stable, which
is like important to realize",00:46:58.070,00:47:04.030
that that can happen.,00:47:04.030,00:47:07.280
"Because up to now, stability has
been, you know, the holy grail.",00:47:07.280,00:47:11.900
"But it's really a good
solution that's the holy grail.",00:47:11.900,00:47:15.210
Yes?,00:47:15.210,00:47:17.090
Go ahead.,00:47:17.090,00:47:17.600
"AUDIENCE: I did kind of a
bigger picture where I basically",00:47:17.600,00:47:21.770
"tried to build
the pieces so just",00:47:21.770,00:47:25.670
"to isolate the advection
term and the diffusion term",00:47:25.670,00:47:28.520
and then build their matrices.,00:47:28.520,00:47:29.905
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:47:29.905,00:47:30.530
"AUDIENCE: And then look
at the combination rule.",00:47:30.530,00:47:32.530
"So when you went to where
you had both terms present--",00:47:32.530,00:47:34.902
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:47:34.902,00:47:35.610
"AUDIENCE: --how the
matrices were actually --",00:47:35.610,00:47:38.650
came together to form the--,00:47:38.650,00:47:40.650
"PROFESSOR: So you took a
matrix picture of the --",00:47:40.650,00:47:45.640
"with all the mesh points, mesh
values, at once rather than--",00:47:45.640,00:47:49.930
"AUDIENCE: And then I simulated
with them just convection,",00:47:49.930,00:47:52.800
"just diffusion and then the
coupled problem of both of them",00:47:52.800,00:47:55.840
"to see how that -- just
one method may be unstable",00:47:55.840,00:48:00.430
for a given formulation--,00:48:00.430,00:48:01.562
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:48:01.562,00:48:02.270
"AUDIENCE: --but yet when
you saw the coupled problem",00:48:02.270,00:48:04.436
"with those two pieces,
it actually is stable.",00:48:04.436,00:48:06.540
"So you could look at like the
-- when you build the matrices,",00:48:06.540,00:48:09.280
"you can look at the eigenvalues
and you can make sure that",00:48:09.280,00:48:12.111
they're--,00:48:12.111,00:48:12.610
"PROFESSOR: Let me
comment a little on that.",00:48:12.610,00:48:15.570
"I'll do that, but I don't want
to cut off anybody who has",00:48:15.570,00:48:19.340
"another comment to throw in here
before I say something about --",00:48:19.340,00:48:23.530
follow up on matrices.,00:48:23.530,00:48:25.920
Anybody got some urgent thing?,00:48:25.920,00:48:29.190
"Let me just, in the
remaining minute,",00:48:29.190,00:48:31.130
"just say a word
because, of course,",00:48:31.130,00:48:34.180
"you'll know that I think
of the matrix description",00:48:34.180,00:48:38.070
quickly and fondly.,00:48:38.070,00:48:41.180
"So just to write down the sort
of matrices that are in here,",00:48:41.180,00:48:46.800
"from the second difference,
the second difference matrix is",00:48:46.800,00:48:51.410
"going to be -- it's going
to have our -- well,",00:48:51.410,00:48:56.120
"I guess it'll be 1, minus
2, and 1 in a typical row.",00:48:56.120,00:49:01.490
"We haven't written
any matrices down.",00:49:01.490,00:49:04.040
"It's amazing that -- we'd be
at about the, I don't know,",00:49:04.040,00:49:11.400
"eighth or ninth lecture now,
and not have seen this matrix,",00:49:11.400,00:49:15.460
but here it is.,00:49:15.460,00:49:16.810
"OK, so that's the matrix where
I'm at a fixed time level.",00:49:16.810,00:49:21.820
"I'm taking the second
differences of all the points",00:49:21.820,00:49:26.110
along that level.,00:49:26.110,00:49:27.570
"And now, the main
point for the moment",00:49:27.570,00:49:31.150
"is to contrast that with
a first difference matrix",00:49:31.150,00:49:35.850
"which, well, that depends
whether I take it centered.",00:49:35.850,00:49:40.040
"Maybe if it's a
centered difference,",00:49:40.040,00:49:42.710
"it would be a 1, 0, minus 1.",00:49:42.710,00:49:45.260
"And, of course, there's a 2
delta x in the denominator.",00:49:45.260,00:49:50.420
"so a minus 1, 0, 1.",00:49:50.420,00:49:53.880
"So that would be a
centered difference that",00:49:53.880,00:49:59.370
"doesn't do anything, doesn't
use the middle value,",00:49:59.370,00:50:02.900
"but takes the difference
between the value at the right",00:50:02.900,00:50:06.360
and the value at the left.,00:50:06.360,00:50:07.570
"Or, an upwind.",00:50:07.570,00:50:09.860
"So delta_upwind would be more
of a 1's forward of the point",00:50:09.860,00:50:18.830
"and minus 1's at
u_(j, n) and 0's here.",00:50:18.830,00:50:26.570
OK.,00:50:26.570,00:50:28.890
"So what you're
saying, am I right",00:50:28.890,00:50:31.420
"in thinking you took
some combination of the--",00:50:31.420,00:50:36.000
"AUDIENCE: An implicit method for
one and explicit for the other,",00:50:39.350,00:50:43.290
"you can do them
independently by --",00:50:43.290,00:50:47.300
"you can invert the
implicit matrix--",00:50:47.300,00:50:50.042
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:50:50.042,00:50:50.750
"AUDIENCE: --and pre-multiply
the other side and build--",00:50:50.750,00:50:53.510
"PROFESSOR: So this
is a way to see,",00:50:53.510,00:50:55.150
"and actually the next
months of our course",00:50:55.150,00:50:58.510
"are going to be
about, how do you",00:50:58.510,00:51:01.990
"deal with these large
difference matrices.",00:51:01.990,00:51:04.920
"These are in one dimension
so they're tridiagonal,",00:51:04.920,00:51:09.060
"and they're, of course,
easy to deal with it.",00:51:09.060,00:51:11.090
"But problems, serious problems,
come up in more dimension.",00:51:11.090,00:51:14.030
"But here, can I just
express one thought here?",00:51:14.030,00:51:20.590
"The eigenvalues
of these matrices",00:51:20.590,00:51:24.340
"and their combinations,
as you say,",00:51:24.340,00:51:26.510
"are what's going to control,
as eigenvalues always do,",00:51:26.510,00:51:30.310
growth of solution.,00:51:30.310,00:51:32.540
"Now we already had
numbers G, growth factors,",00:51:32.540,00:51:37.970
"that we computed by the von
Neumann idea of following",00:51:37.970,00:51:43.750
"exponentials, e to the i*k*x.",00:51:43.750,00:51:46.100
"So these numbers too were --
their purpose was to track",00:51:46.100,00:51:51.270
the growth of solution.,00:51:51.270,00:51:54.360
"And what I want to say is
that very often, I mean,",00:51:54.360,00:51:57.730
"that these numbers and the
eigenvalues of the matrices,",00:51:57.730,00:52:03.460
"they're very closely
related ideas.",00:52:03.460,00:52:07.760
"In fact, they'll
be the same idea",00:52:07.760,00:52:09.960
"if the eigenvector is
a pure exponential.",00:52:09.960,00:52:14.050
"So that's really the
link between eigenvalues",00:52:14.050,00:52:17.950
"of matrices and growth factors
G that depended on frequency k.",00:52:17.950,00:52:25.500
"If the eigenvector was a pure
e to the i*k*x on the mesh,",00:52:25.500,00:52:32.890
"then that growth factor is
identical to the eigenvalue",00:52:32.890,00:52:39.140
"that we get in one step of
the difference equation.",00:52:39.140,00:52:43.290
"So the idea was that the
eigenvectors, the details",00:52:43.290,00:52:49.280
"of the eigenvectors,
will be affected",00:52:49.280,00:52:51.340
by boundary conditions.,00:52:51.340,00:52:53.070
