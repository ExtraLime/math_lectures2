LINAN CHEN: Hi everyone.,00:00:06.310,00:00:07.350
I'm Linan.,00:00:07.350,00:00:08.300
Welcome back to recitation.,00:00:08.300,00:00:10.300
"In recent lectures, we
have studied the properties",00:00:10.300,00:00:13.090
of the determinant.,00:00:13.090,00:00:14.050
"And we also derived the
formula to compute it.",00:00:14.050,00:00:17.130
"Today we're going to
put what we learned",00:00:17.130,00:00:19.280
"into practice by considering
these two examples.",00:00:19.280,00:00:23.480
"So we want to find out the
determinants of these two 5",00:00:23.480,00:00:27.630
by 5 matrices.,00:00:27.630,00:00:29.880
"And as you can
see, matrix A has x",00:00:29.880,00:00:33.700
"along this diagonal, and in the
first four rows, y to the right",00:00:33.700,00:00:38.990
"of x, except for the last row.",00:00:38.990,00:00:41.750
"And zero entries
everywhere else.",00:00:41.750,00:00:44.730
"And matrix B also has
x along this diagonal",00:00:44.730,00:00:49.040
and y everywhere else.,00:00:49.040,00:00:52.220
"Before starting, let me
help you review what you",00:00:52.220,00:00:55.910
can do to compute determinants.,00:00:55.910,00:00:58.740
"Of course, you can
carry out elimination",00:00:58.740,00:01:01.810
"to transform your original
matrix into upper triangular",00:01:01.810,00:01:05.459
matrix.,00:01:05.459,00:01:07.040
"Or you can use this
big summation formula.",00:01:07.040,00:01:11.570
"Another choice would be
you can do it by cofactors.",00:01:11.570,00:01:16.010
"Namely, you can expand
your original matrix",00:01:16.010,00:01:19.220
"along any row or any column,
and then the determinant",00:01:19.220,00:01:23.090
"is simply given
by the dot product",00:01:23.090,00:01:25.580
"of that row or that
column with its cofactors.",00:01:25.580,00:01:30.150
"Why don't you pause the video
now and try to work on them",00:01:30.150,00:01:33.370
yourself.,00:01:33.370,00:01:34.440
"Whenever you're ready, I'll
come back and show you my way.",00:01:34.440,00:01:37.490
"I hope you just had some
fun with these two problems.",00:01:46.990,00:01:49.850
Now let's look at them together.,00:01:49.850,00:01:52.290
Let's look at matrix A first.,00:01:52.290,00:01:55.110
"As you can see, there are a lot
of zero entries in matrix A.",00:01:55.110,00:01:59.370
"So perhaps you don't need
elimination to introduce more",00:01:59.370,00:02:02.280
0's.,00:02:02.280,00:02:04.270
"Furthermore, we observe
this pattern of A,",00:02:04.270,00:02:07.580
"and you notice that if
I cover the last row",00:02:07.580,00:02:12.640
"and the first column, so
if this column and this row",00:02:12.640,00:02:16.680
"are not here, what is left
over is simply a 4 by 4",00:02:16.680,00:02:20.730
lower triangular matrix.,00:02:20.730,00:02:23.140
"And similarly, if you
cover the first column",00:02:23.140,00:02:27.530
"and the first row, what is
left over here is simply a 4",00:02:27.530,00:02:33.140
by 4 upper triangular matrix.,00:02:33.140,00:02:36.030
"This is telling
us that we should",00:02:36.030,00:02:37.910
"calculate the determinant
of A by the third method.",00:02:37.910,00:02:42.850
"So we should expand along
the first column of A,",00:02:42.850,00:02:46.630
and we calculate the cofactors.,00:02:46.630,00:02:48.920
Let's do it now.,00:02:48.920,00:02:51.020
"So determinant of A,
is equal to the (1, 1)",00:02:51.020,00:03:00.110
"entry of A, which is
x, times the cofactor",00:03:00.110,00:03:06.270
"of that spot, which is the
determinant of the leftover 4",00:03:06.270,00:03:10.690
by 4 matrix.,00:03:10.690,00:03:13.080
"And it's upper triangular,
so its determinant is simply",00:03:13.080,00:03:16.200
given by x to the power 4.,00:03:16.200,00:03:21.450
"Plus, the only other
nonzero entry in that column",00:03:21.450,00:03:26.260
is the y at the very bottom.,00:03:26.260,00:03:28.860
So you put y here.,00:03:28.860,00:03:32.530
"And you multiply
y by the cofactor",00:03:32.530,00:03:35.390
"of that spot, which is the
determinant of the leftover 4",00:03:35.390,00:03:40.290
by 4 matrix again.,00:03:40.290,00:03:42.130
"In this case, it's
lower triangular",00:03:42.130,00:03:44.580
"and its determinant
is y to the power 4.",00:03:44.580,00:03:47.660
So I have a y to the power 4.,00:03:47.660,00:03:51.480
But not quite.,00:03:51.480,00:03:53.520
"In principle, there
should be another factor",00:03:53.520,00:03:56.720
here indicating the sign.,00:03:56.720,00:03:59.150
"And the sign in this
case, well because the y",00:03:59.150,00:04:03.430
"is the entry in the fifth
row and the first column,",00:04:03.430,00:04:08.110
"so this factor
should be negative 1",00:04:08.110,00:04:11.190
to the power 5 plus 1.,00:04:11.190,00:04:14.670
"And of course, it's just 1.",00:04:14.670,00:04:16.839
"So the determinant
of A is simply",00:04:16.839,00:04:20.410
"equal to x to the fifth power
plus y to the fifth power.",00:04:20.410,00:04:29.780
Did you get the correct answer?,00:04:29.780,00:04:32.180
"Well, the determinant
of A is not too bad,",00:04:32.180,00:04:34.700
"because A has a lot
of zero entries.",00:04:34.700,00:04:37.310
"Now let's look at the
determinant of matrix B.",00:04:37.310,00:04:42.060
I have another copy of B here.,00:04:42.060,00:04:45.320
"So B also has a very
clear structure.",00:04:45.320,00:04:48.710
"It has x along its diagonal,
and y everywhere else.",00:04:48.710,00:04:53.080
"But in general, B does
not have any zero entry.",00:04:53.080,00:04:57.520
"So perhaps our first step should
be carrying out elimination",00:04:57.520,00:05:02.630
"to introduce zero
entries into matrix B.",00:05:02.630,00:05:07.000
"Of course, you can do it
by the regular routine.",00:05:07.000,00:05:10.370
"You start with the
first row, find a pivot,",00:05:10.370,00:05:13.080
"and eliminate the second
row and the third row",00:05:13.080,00:05:15.840
and so on and so forth.,00:05:15.840,00:05:17.750
"But in this case,
there's a shortcut.",00:05:17.750,00:05:20.870
"If you compare two rows
that are next to each other,",00:05:20.870,00:05:24.630
"for example, if we compare the
fourth row and the fifth row,",00:05:24.630,00:05:28.920
"you notice that they have
a lot of entries in common.",00:05:28.920,00:05:33.030
"And they're only different
at these two spots.",00:05:33.030,00:05:37.450
"So imagine if I subtract the
fourth row from the fifth row.",00:05:37.450,00:05:42.830
"So if I do the
following operation--",00:05:42.830,00:05:48.360
"so I subtract this
row from the last row.",00:05:48.360,00:05:54.620
"Then the new fifth row
should become the following.",00:05:54.620,00:06:00.290
"So this row will become 0,
0, 0, y minus x, x minus y.",00:06:00.290,00:06:09.580
"You see, just by this
simple operation,",00:06:12.860,00:06:15.710
"I have introduced three
zero entries at once.",00:06:15.710,00:06:18.830
"And it's similar with the
fourth row and the third row.",00:06:22.420,00:06:25.640
"They have common entries
here, here, and here.",00:06:25.640,00:06:30.030
"So you subtract the third
row from the fourth row.",00:06:30.030,00:06:33.670
"You update the fourth row to
0, 0, y minus x, x minus y, 0.",00:06:36.520,00:06:46.410
"Again, three zero entries.",00:06:46.410,00:06:49.210
"And same thing happened to the
second row and the third row.",00:06:49.210,00:06:52.990
"So you subtract the second
row from the third row",00:06:52.990,00:06:56.780
"and your new third
row will become 0,",00:06:56.780,00:07:01.070
"y minus x, x minus y, 0, 0.",00:07:01.070,00:07:08.290
"Finally, you subtract the
first row from the second row,",00:07:08.290,00:07:14.860
"and then you update
the second row",00:07:14.860,00:07:16.925
"to y minus x, x
minus y, 0, 0, 0.",00:07:16.925,00:07:25.210
"Let's keep the
first row unchanged.",00:07:25.210,00:07:27.190
So I'm going to copy here.,00:07:27.190,00:07:28.720
All right.,00:07:33.990,00:07:34.630
"By row elimination, we have
introduced many zero entries",00:07:34.630,00:07:38.920
"to matrix B. Is
there anything else",00:07:38.920,00:07:42.540
that I can take advantage of?,00:07:42.540,00:07:46.640
"Let's observe the pattern
of this new matrix.",00:07:46.640,00:07:50.090
"As you can see, in each row,
you have two nonzero entries,",00:07:50.090,00:07:54.740
except for the first row.,00:07:54.740,00:07:56.420
"And they're only
different by a sign.",00:07:56.420,00:07:58.850
"So if, somehow, you can figure
out a way to sum them up,",00:07:58.850,00:08:02.760
"you will get even
more zero entries.",00:08:02.760,00:08:05.540
So let's do it.,00:08:05.540,00:08:06.900
"That's going to involve
the operations on column.",00:08:06.900,00:08:10.930
So here is how I do it.,00:08:10.930,00:08:13.880
"I'm going to keep the
last column unchanged.",00:08:16.720,00:08:21.310
"So the last column is
y, 0, 0, 0, x minus y.",00:08:21.310,00:08:28.540
"What I will do is I will add
a copy of the last column",00:08:32.870,00:08:37.620
to the fourth column.,00:08:37.620,00:08:39.220
So this is what I'm going to do.,00:08:39.220,00:08:41.230
"Add one copy of the last
column to the fourth column.",00:08:41.230,00:08:46.450
"Now the new fourth column will
become 2y, 0, 0, x minus y, 0.",00:08:46.450,00:08:57.890
"As you can see, by doing
this, I have killed this spot.",00:08:57.890,00:09:02.440
"So I have introduced
one more zero entry",00:09:02.440,00:09:05.160
into my fourth column.,00:09:05.160,00:09:07.420
"If you continue, you may
want to add the fourth column",00:09:07.420,00:09:11.870
to the third column.,00:09:11.870,00:09:13.200
"Let's see what will
happen if you do that.",00:09:13.200,00:09:15.840
"So if you add the fourth
column to the third column,",00:09:15.840,00:09:24.140
"now what should appear here is
2y, 0, x minus y, 0, y minus x.",00:09:24.140,00:09:35.311
"But in this new third
column, you still",00:09:38.770,00:09:42.770
"have two zero entries,
which is the same",00:09:42.770,00:09:45.870
as the original third column.,00:09:45.870,00:09:48.470
"So although you've
killed this spot,",00:09:48.470,00:09:50.960
"but you've introduced
a new nonzero entry.",00:09:50.960,00:09:55.070
"So is there a way that we
can kill this spot too?",00:09:55.070,00:10:00.260
"You may have noticed that if you
add a copy of the fifth column",00:10:00.260,00:10:06.000
"to this column again, then that
spot will have been killed.",00:10:06.000,00:10:11.560
So let's do it.,00:10:11.560,00:10:12.780
"If I add this
column to this one--",00:10:12.780,00:10:15.800
"I'm going to just
update it here-- then",00:10:15.800,00:10:18.140
"the first entry
should become 3y.",00:10:18.140,00:10:24.470
These are unchanged.,00:10:24.470,00:10:27.060
And the last spot becomes 0.,00:10:27.060,00:10:29.400
"It reflects here
as you are adding",00:10:34.680,00:10:38.190
"a copy of the fourth column
and a copy of the fifth column",00:10:38.190,00:10:42.540
to the third column.,00:10:42.540,00:10:44.810
Now you've got the idea.,00:10:44.810,00:10:46.560
And you continue.,00:10:46.560,00:10:48.130
"What do you do with
the second column?",00:10:48.130,00:10:51.050
"This time you will have to add
a copy of the third column,",00:10:51.050,00:10:58.550
"a copy of the fourth column, and
the copy of the fifth column.",00:10:58.550,00:11:02.020
"So you update the second column
to be 4y, x minus y, 0, 0, 0.",00:11:06.030,00:11:17.040
"Eventually, what you will
do to the first column",00:11:19.630,00:11:22.650
"would be you add everything
to the first column.",00:11:22.650,00:11:29.770
So a copy of each.,00:11:29.770,00:11:32.920
"Then the first
column will become--",00:11:41.360,00:11:43.710
"so I don't have
enough spot here,",00:11:43.710,00:11:45.760
so make it here-- x plus 4y.,00:11:45.760,00:11:50.870
Then everything else is 0.,00:11:50.870,00:11:56.070
This is fun.,00:11:56.070,00:11:57.290
And the result's really nice.,00:11:57.290,00:11:59.110
"This is wonderful
because this is simply",00:11:59.110,00:12:01.260
upper triangular matrix.,00:12:01.260,00:12:03.080
"Now you tell me: what
is the determinant of B?",00:12:03.080,00:12:06.290
"The determinant of
B is the determinant",00:12:06.290,00:12:12.070
of this upper triangular matrix.,00:12:12.070,00:12:14.240
"So you simply multiply
everything together,",00:12:14.240,00:12:17.040
"that's x plus 4y times x
minus y to the fourth power.",00:12:17.040,00:12:27.100
"So I hope you enjoyed
these two examples.",00:12:29.640,00:12:33.480
"Maybe your method is
different from mine,",00:12:33.480,00:12:35.980
"but at least these
two examples teach us",00:12:35.980,00:12:38.370
"that you can be flexible
in combining methods",00:12:38.370,00:12:41.390
in calculating determinants.,00:12:41.390,00:12:43.497
"Thanks for watching,
and I'm looking forward",00:12:43.497,00:12:45.330
to see you soon.,00:12:45.330,00:12:47.280
