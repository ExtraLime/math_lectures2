PROFESSOR: All right.,00:00:21.155,00:00:22.030
So I brought a few problems.,00:00:22.030,00:00:23.220
"They're obviously not the quiz
problems, though some of them",00:00:23.220,00:00:26.950
are supposed to be similar.,00:00:26.950,00:00:29.280
"What I have here
might not be what",00:00:29.280,00:00:30.880
"you have on the quiz because
we might drop quiz problems",00:00:30.880,00:00:33.260

are just meant to make",00:00:33.260,00:00:35.280
"you think and not to give away
the solutions to the quiz.",00:00:35.280,00:00:39.310
"Now, before we get
started on this,",00:00:39.310,00:00:41.490
"do you guys have any burning
questions or any concepts",00:00:41.490,00:00:43.814
that you want covered?,00:00:43.814,00:00:44.730
"Based on that, I'll select
which problems we do.",00:00:44.730,00:00:46.800
Yes?,00:00:46.800,00:00:47.727
"AUDIENCE: This actually relates
not too much to the Pset.",00:00:47.727,00:00:50.288
"If you're looking at
the time complexity",00:00:53.040,00:00:55.725
"to maybe transfer something
from one table to another,",00:00:55.725,00:01:02.360
"it takes a lot
more time, I would",00:01:02.360,00:01:04.164
"assume, to move the actual
item to the new table",00:01:04.164,00:01:06.980
"than it does just to look
at your point and be like,",00:01:06.980,00:01:09.250
"oh, there's nothing there.",00:01:09.250,00:01:10.680

just going to look",00:01:10.680,00:01:12.187
"through an empty
table of size m,",00:01:12.187,00:01:14.330
"the time to look through that
empty table, I'm assuming,",00:01:14.330,00:01:17.325
"is much less than the time
to actually move an item.",00:01:17.325,00:01:21.210
"PROFESSOR: So you're saying
we have m things here.",00:01:21.210,00:01:28.650
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:01:28.650,00:01:29.350
"PROFESSOR: Some might
be nil, and some",00:01:29.350,00:01:33.050
"might have stuff
in them, and you're",00:01:33.050,00:01:36.260
"going to resize that to
presumably 2 times m,",00:01:36.260,00:01:41.166
"and the way you
do that is you're",00:01:41.166,00:01:42.540
"going to move the elements,
presumably by rehashing them,",00:01:42.540,00:01:45.730

big elements anywhere.",00:01:53.560,00:01:57.060
"If you have a big

"work with references
to that object.",00:01:59.000,00:02:01.270
"So you remember
the address where",00:02:01.270,00:02:03.280
"that object lies in memory,
and since the memory is",00:02:03.280,00:02:06.510
"finite and small, addresses are
all from 0 to a small number,",00:02:06.510,00:02:10.110
so they're constant.,00:02:10.110,00:02:12.650
"So what you have here
is not a big object.",00:02:12.650,00:02:15.990
"It's the address
of the big object,",00:02:15.990,00:02:17.800

saying is let's",00:02:21.470,00:02:23.750
"say that the table
is completely full",00:02:23.750,00:02:26.230

"to look the empty table, right?",00:02:34.510,00:02:36.515
PROFESSOR: Let's see.,00:02:36.515,00:02:37.390
"So writing something here
is order 1 time, right?",00:02:37.390,00:02:42.300
So moving is order 1 time.,00:02:42.300,00:02:44.350
"Moving one element
is order 1 time.",00:02:44.350,00:02:47.130
"What's accessing an element
in a table in a list?",00:02:47.130,00:02:50.242

How many indices do you do?,00:03:04.060,00:03:05.680
How many times the index?,00:03:05.680,00:03:07.915

"So if the table is empty,
you have order m indices",00:03:14.890,00:03:17.620

2m, which is order m.",00:03:35.615,00:03:38.835

matter whether the table's",00:03:38.835,00:03:40.960
full or empty.,00:03:40.960,00:03:42.198
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:03:42.198,00:03:42.739
Just wanted to confirm that.,00:03:42.739,00:03:44.160
"PROFESSOR: And this
is how you do that.",00:03:44.160,00:03:45.784
Cool.,00:03:47.940,00:03:48.460
Thanks.,00:03:48.460,00:03:49.022
Any other questions?,00:03:49.022,00:03:49.855
"Then we will go over problems in
the order in which I like them,",00:04:00.410,00:04:04.480
"which is easiest to
hardest so that I",00:04:04.480,00:04:06.110
"don't have to explain
the hard ones.",00:04:06.110,00:04:07.690
Warm up problem one.,00:04:14.710,00:04:16.570
"So you have this recursion
and you have to solve it,",00:04:24.800,00:04:27.720
"and you get a hint that n
to the power of 1 over log n",00:04:27.720,00:04:40.350
"is 2, which is theta 1.",00:04:40.350,00:04:45.540
"So based on the
hint, you can see",00:04:45.540,00:04:47.130
"that it's going to
involve some math.",00:04:47.130,00:04:50.826
It's going to get a bit ugly.,00:04:50.826,00:04:53.700
So how do we solve recursions?,00:04:53.700,00:04:55.260
Two methods.,00:04:55.260,00:04:56.110
What are they?,00:04:56.110,00:04:57.514
AUDIENCE: Expand.,00:04:57.514,00:04:59.927
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:04:59.927,00:05:00.510
"Substitution formally,
but basically, we",00:05:00.510,00:05:02.951
"expand this guy
over and over again.",00:05:02.951,00:05:04.450
And?,00:05:04.450,00:05:06.084
AUDIENCE: Trees.,00:05:06.084,00:05:07.340
PROFESSOR: Recursion trees.,00:05:07.340,00:05:09.970
"Which one do guys
want to do first?",00:05:09.970,00:05:11.610
"If you only have
one t here, anything",00:05:15.080,00:05:17.780
"works because you can keep
expanding it and that works,",00:05:17.780,00:05:22.340
so we can do either method.,00:05:22.340,00:05:24.317
"Which one do you
guys want to go over?",00:05:24.317,00:05:25.900
Trees.,00:05:28.580,00:05:29.740
OK.,00:05:29.740,00:05:31.100
So we start with the first node.,00:05:31.100,00:05:36.020
The size of the problem is n.,00:05:36.020,00:05:39.292
What's the cost inside here?,00:05:39.292,00:05:41.732
AUDIENCE: 1.,00:05:45.148,00:05:46.130
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:05:46.130,00:05:47.550
So this creates one sub-problem.,00:05:47.550,00:05:50.620
What's the size?,00:05:50.620,00:05:51.483
AUDIENCE: n to the 1/2.,00:05:54.198,00:05:56.170
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:05:56.170,00:05:58.130
"Square root of n
equals n to the 1/2.",00:05:58.130,00:06:00.530
You solved it already.,00:06:00.530,00:06:01.774
What's the cost?,00:06:01.774,00:06:02.440
AUDIENCE: 1.,00:06:05.279,00:06:05.779
"PROFESSOR: Do people
remember this?",00:06:08.641,00:06:10.660
"Is anyone confused about
what's going on here?",00:06:10.660,00:06:14.980
OK.,00:06:14.980,00:06:15.760
"So two terms, something
involving t and something",00:06:15.760,00:06:19.710
not involving t.,00:06:19.710,00:06:21.250
"The thing involving t is
what we want to get rid of.",00:06:21.250,00:06:24.110
"When we do our recursion
tree, whatever is in here",00:06:24.110,00:06:29.870
"goes inside here,
and this tells me",00:06:29.870,00:06:34.030
"how this number
relates to this number.",00:06:34.030,00:06:37.920
"So when I go from one
level to the next level,",00:06:37.920,00:06:41.250
this is the transformation.,00:06:41.250,00:06:42.550
"n and becomes square root of
n, so the transformation here",00:06:42.550,00:06:48.406
"is the same as the
transformation here.",00:06:48.406,00:06:50.030
What's next?,00:06:57.880,00:07:00.133
AUDIENCE: n to the 1/4.,00:07:00.133,00:07:02.152

"Do we need to do one more or
do people see the pattern?",00:07:10.000,00:07:12.350
Silence means one more.,00:07:16.090,00:07:17.340
"If you guys don't speak,
we're going to go slow.",00:07:17.340,00:07:21.240

everyone saw the pattern,",00:07:35.200,00:07:37.170
"and suppose we've done
this for l levels,",00:07:37.170,00:07:40.590
so we're at the bottom.,00:07:40.590,00:07:43.330

say that this is",00:08:11.015,00:08:12.390
"level h, where h is
the height of the tree.",00:08:12.390,00:08:15.080

that looks like that?",00:08:26.420,00:08:30.876
"AUDIENCE: If the recursion
tree is height i,",00:08:30.876,00:08:33.300
"it is n to the 1 over 2
to the i, but 2 to the i",00:08:33.300,00:08:35.299

approximately n.",00:08:35.299,00:08:37.267
PROFESSOR: Why?,00:08:40.835,00:08:41.459
"I like that, but why?",00:08:46.960,00:08:48.520
"AUDIENCE: Because
you need to go down",00:08:48.520,00:08:54.550
"until you're only
looking at one element,",00:08:54.550,00:08:57.690
"and that would be one
nth of the problem.",00:08:57.690,00:09:02.067
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:09:02.067,00:09:02.650
"So we want this guy
to look like what?",00:09:02.650,00:09:05.968
"In fact, it doesn't exactly
have to look like 1, but what's",00:09:15.450,00:09:17.990
"the advantage if we manage to
get this guy to look like 1?",00:09:17.990,00:09:22.417
We have a recursion.,00:09:22.417,00:09:23.250
"We don't have a base
case here, right?",00:09:23.250,00:09:25.940
"A reasonable base case
is T of 1 is theta 1.",00:09:25.940,00:09:34.780
"Whatever function that is,
if you evaluate it at 1,",00:09:34.780,00:09:37.800
"you're going to get a
constant, so you can say that.",00:09:37.800,00:09:41.640
"Now, at the same time I can
say that for any constant,",00:09:41.640,00:09:45.376
"c, T of c is theta 1.",00:09:45.376,00:09:50.660
"So if I take this constant
here, which happens to be 2,",00:09:53.180,00:09:59.410
"but that's not to
worry about that.",00:09:59.410,00:10:01.100
"If I take this guy here,
I can put it in here.",00:10:01.100,00:10:04.320
"And I know that this guy
here equals this guy here.",00:10:08.350,00:10:12.560
"So if I can make this guy
here look like this guy here,",00:10:12.560,00:10:17.210
then I'm done.,00:10:17.210,00:10:20.500
Make sense?,00:10:20.500,00:10:21.015
"If it makes sense,

"that I know and I can go
forward, or smile or something.",00:10:25.740,00:10:30.720
So this should look like 1.,00:10:30.720,00:10:32.250
This is order 1 if not 1.,00:10:32.250,00:10:35.240

need to solve the equation.,00:11:10.710,00:11:11.834
"But for the tree,
there are two steps.",00:11:11.834,00:11:14.160
"So we need to add up
all the costs here",00:11:14.160,00:11:15.990
and that's the total cost here.,00:11:15.990,00:11:18.220
"In order to do that, first,
we sum up over each level.",00:11:18.220,00:11:24.681
"And in this case,
it's really simple",00:11:24.681,00:11:26.180
"because there's only
one node per level,",00:11:26.180,00:11:27.846
"but if you have multiple
nodes per level,",00:11:27.846,00:11:29.690
"you have to sum
up for each level,",00:11:29.690,00:11:31.600
"and then you have
to do a big sum.",00:11:31.600,00:11:33.570
What's the sum for this level?,00:11:33.570,00:11:37.441
1.,00:11:37.441,00:11:37.940
"Come on, guys.",00:11:40.920,00:11:41.610
You're scaring me.,00:11:41.610,00:11:43.834
AUDIENCE: 1.,00:11:43.834,00:11:45.325
AUDIENCE: 1.,00:11:45.325,00:11:46.319
AUDIENCE: It's all 1.,00:11:46.319,00:11:47.320
PROFESSOR: Excellent.,00:11:47.320,00:11:48.564
"So the only thing
that I'm missing",00:11:48.564,00:11:49.980
"is to know how many levels I
have, because the sum is going",00:11:49.980,00:11:53.070
"to be order h, whatever h is.",00:11:53.070,00:11:58.050
How do we do that?,00:11:58.050,00:11:59.480
"n to the 1 over 2
to the power of h",00:11:59.480,00:12:02.990
"has to equal this guy, right?",00:12:02.990,00:12:07.030
"AUDIENCE: Why would
it equal that guy?",00:12:07.030,00:12:08.852
"We know it's less
than that guy, but we",00:12:08.852,00:12:11.122
"don't know it's
equal to that guy.",00:12:11.122,00:12:13.150
"PROFESSOR: We have to make
it equal because we can only",00:12:13.150,00:12:15.600
"stop when we get
to the base case.",00:12:15.600,00:12:18.300
"So we have to expand
the recursion tree",00:12:18.300,00:12:20.210
"until we get to a base
case, and then we stop,",00:12:20.210,00:12:22.570
"and this is our base
case because this",00:12:22.570,00:12:25.270
"is what the problem says
should be our base case.",00:12:25.270,00:12:27.670
"AUDIENCE: Right, but n
to the 1 over 2 to the h",00:12:27.670,00:12:29.774
"is not equal to n
to the 1 over log n.",00:12:29.774,00:12:39.172
"PROFESSOR: Well, we can set
h to be whatever we want.",00:12:39.172,00:12:41.380
"h is the height of the tree,
so we don't know what it is.",00:12:41.380,00:12:44.540
We have to find out what it is.,00:12:44.540,00:12:46.166
"AUDIENCE: So let's
say 2 to the h",00:12:46.166,00:12:47.540
"is equal to log n if you want
to make it look like that.",00:12:47.540,00:12:52.992
"PROFESSOR: Let me
write down the equation",00:12:52.992,00:12:54.700
to make sure you're right.,00:12:54.700,00:12:57.030
"You're probably right because
you're thinking faster than me,",00:12:57.030,00:13:00.010
"but let me not embarrass myself
and do this the right way.",00:13:00.010,00:13:04.136
"So you said 2 to the
h is log n, right?",00:13:09.970,00:13:14.890
Looks about right.,00:13:14.890,00:13:15.640
So what's h?,00:13:15.640,00:13:19.215
AUDIENCE: Log base 2.,00:13:19.215,00:13:21.500
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:13:21.500,00:13:23.770
Log log n.,00:13:23.770,00:13:25.410
So T of n is order h.,00:13:28.110,00:13:30.600
We got this from here.,00:13:30.600,00:13:33.950
"T of n is order h is
order of log log n.",00:13:33.950,00:13:43.510
"Math people drowning, right?",00:13:43.510,00:13:44.820
Any questions about this?,00:13:48.090,00:13:49.205
Yes?,00:13:52.260,00:13:53.493
"AUDIENCE: The first
line on the right--",00:13:53.493,00:13:55.710
PROFESSOR: This?,00:13:55.710,00:13:56.565
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:13:56.565,00:13:57.190
Is that your base case?,00:13:57.190,00:13:58.148
What is that?,00:13:58.148,00:13:59.214
"PROFESSOR: We got a hint
with the problem that said,",00:13:59.214,00:14:01.380
"n to the power of 1 over log
n is 2, which is order 1.",00:14:01.380,00:14:06.660
"So for the base case, we always
want them to look like this.",00:14:09.640,00:14:12.507
"If we don't get a base case,
we write our own base case,",00:14:12.507,00:14:14.840
"which is if you
plug in a constant,",00:14:14.840,00:14:16.700
you're going to get a constant.,00:14:16.700,00:14:18.950
"And since we're told that
this guy is a constant,",00:14:18.950,00:14:21.580
"that's a pretty good hint
that we want to get to it.",00:14:21.580,00:14:24.405
"Let's see how we're
doing on time.",00:14:29.994,00:14:31.410
Good.,00:14:31.410,00:14:34.080
"Ready to move on to
the next problem?",00:14:34.080,00:14:37.740
Let's do a fun one.,00:14:37.740,00:14:38.832
"Some people might remember
it from elementary school,",00:14:38.832,00:14:41.040
"but this time, we're going to
look at it with our 6.006 eyes.",00:14:41.040,00:14:44.450
"So suppose you have
m coins, gold coins.",00:14:44.450,00:14:50.850
One of them is face.,00:14:50.850,00:14:51.840
"The fake one is super light
because it's not real gold.",00:14:51.840,00:14:54.340
"It's something that
looks like gold.",00:14:54.340,00:14:57.380
"And we have a scale, and
the scale is super accurate.",00:14:57.380,00:15:03.210
"It can weigh any
coins on either side",00:15:03.210,00:15:05.950
"and tell us which
side is heavier.",00:15:05.950,00:15:08.640
"Perfect accuracy, no need
to worry about errors.",00:15:08.640,00:15:10.830
"I want to find out which
coin is the bad coin.",00:15:13.690,00:15:16.550
"What is the minimum number
of experiments I have to do?",00:15:16.550,00:15:19.410
"So there is a strategy, and
we can worry about that later,",00:15:22.440,00:15:24.880
"but using 6.006, what is the
minimum number of experiments",00:15:24.880,00:15:28.790
I have to do?,00:15:28.790,00:15:30.284
AUDIENCE: Log N times.,00:15:30.284,00:15:31.280
PROFESSOR: Not quite.,00:15:35.770,00:15:36.710
"So this is what you
think is, and you",00:15:36.710,00:15:38.280
"can do log n with
binary search, right?",00:15:38.280,00:15:41.620
"The problem with binary search
is if I put half of my coins",00:15:41.620,00:15:45.270
"on the left, half of
my coins on the right,",00:15:45.270,00:15:47.550
"one side is going to
be heavier, right?",00:15:47.550,00:15:49.960
"So the answers are going
to be this or this,",00:15:49.960,00:15:53.430
but I never get this.,00:15:53.430,00:15:55.610
"I only get one
bit of information",00:15:55.610,00:15:58.750
instead of getting one trit.,00:15:58.750,00:16:00.760
A trit is a base three digit.,00:16:00.760,00:16:03.250
"How many bits of
information in a trit?",00:16:03.250,00:16:07.952
AUDIENCE: One and a half.,00:16:07.952,00:16:10.362
PROFESSOR: Roughly.,00:16:10.362,00:16:12.290
AUDIENCE: Log 3.,00:16:12.290,00:16:13.712
PROFESSOR: Log 3.,00:16:13.712,00:16:14.420
"And we know that it's
base 2 because that's",00:16:14.420,00:16:16.211
what we use in CS.,00:16:16.211,00:16:17.720
"So we're discarding a
fractional bit of information",00:16:17.720,00:16:21.790
"if we're not allowing
for this to happen.",00:16:21.790,00:16:25.046
"Anyone want to try
something else?",00:16:31.550,00:16:33.254
"We have to prove
this, by the way.",00:16:33.254,00:16:34.670
"We have to prove the minimum
that we come up with.",00:16:34.670,00:16:36.753
"AUDIENCE: You could
just do it coin by coin,",00:16:40.176,00:16:42.064
but that would take forever.,00:16:42.064,00:16:43.490
"PROFESSOR: That's
N. That's worse.",00:16:43.490,00:16:45.010
"AUDIENCE: How about log base
4 N or something like that?",00:16:45.010,00:16:50.620
"AUDIENCE: Can you explain
to me why we can't just",00:16:50.620,00:16:53.020
do binary search?,00:16:53.020,00:16:54.190
PROFESSOR: We can.,00:16:54.190,00:16:55.140
"It's definitely going to
give us the correct answer,",00:16:55.140,00:16:58.030
"but it's not the minimum
number of weighings",00:16:58.030,00:17:00.190
"because we're discarding
a possible answer.",00:17:00.190,00:17:03.570
"So if you do binary
search, you will never",00:17:03.570,00:17:05.319
"get that the two
sides are equal.",00:17:05.319,00:17:07.470
AUDIENCE: Log base 3.,00:17:07.470,00:17:08.700
"PROFESSOR: Log base
3 would be better",00:17:08.700,00:17:10.560
"because we have three
choices all the time.",00:17:10.560,00:17:12.829
Let's prove that.,00:17:12.829,00:17:13.980
"So the right answer happens to
be log base 3 of N. Let's see",00:17:13.980,00:17:17.190
"how we would get it
aside from guessing.",00:17:17.190,00:17:19.880
"AUDIENCE: So you
divide it into thirds",00:17:19.880,00:17:22.850
"and compare one third and one
third, and if they're equal,",00:17:22.850,00:17:26.810
"then the light one is
in the other third.",00:17:26.810,00:17:29.285
"And if they're not,
[INAUDIBLE] light one.",00:17:29.285,00:17:31.265
"Then you just keep
dividing by 3.",00:17:31.265,00:17:34.937
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:17:34.937,00:17:35.520
So that's the strategy.,00:17:35.520,00:17:36.760
"What if I don't
know the strategy?",00:17:36.760,00:17:38.250
"How do I do this without
knowing the strategy?",00:17:38.250,00:17:40.166
"AUDIENCE: What if the number
of coins isn't divisible by 3?",00:17:42.668,00:17:46.014
PROFESSOR: Math people.,00:17:49.360,00:17:52.186
"AUDIENCE: Yeah, but then
how do you-- OK, never mind.",00:17:52.186,00:17:56.520
"AUDIENCE: Just take the two
extra coins and toss them out.",00:17:56.520,00:17:59.134
"PROFESSOR: If it's
not divisible by 3,",00:18:02.220,00:18:03.810
"you add fake coins
that are good.",00:18:03.810,00:18:07.540
"I mean, you use good coins.",00:18:07.540,00:18:11.050
"But we're not worried
about the strategy.",00:18:11.050,00:18:13.500
"I want us to think
of a lower bound.",00:18:13.500,00:18:15.240
"This is a lower bound
for an algorithm, right?",00:18:15.240,00:18:17.470
"You cannot do better
than log 3 N experiments.",00:18:17.470,00:18:23.280
"Does the word ""lower
bound"" ring any bells?",00:18:23.280,00:18:27.247
"Is there any lecture where
we talked about lower bounds?",00:18:27.247,00:18:29.580
"So if you sort and you're
using a comparison model,",00:18:37.070,00:18:39.830
what's the best you can do?,00:18:39.830,00:18:40.970
AUDIENCE: N log N.,00:18:44.260,00:18:46.140
PROFESSOR: N log N. Good.,00:18:46.140,00:18:48.700
"So sorting using CMP, the
comparison model, is N log N.",00:18:48.700,00:18:58.010
How did we prove that?,00:18:58.010,00:18:59.110
One word.,00:19:06.360,00:19:07.300
"Well, two words.",00:19:07.300,00:19:08.080
Decision trees.,00:19:12.160,00:19:13.280
"Does anyone remember
what decision trees are?",00:19:13.280,00:19:16.140
One person.,00:19:16.140,00:19:17.086
"AUDIENCE: It's just a
comparison thing, right?",00:19:17.086,00:19:19.107
"You're like, is it
greater, is it less than,",00:19:19.107,00:19:20.940
"or is there some
sort of question",00:19:20.940,00:19:22.315
you're asking about each key.,00:19:22.315,00:19:24.384
PROFESSOR: Cool.,00:19:24.384,00:19:25.050
Let's go over that a little bit.,00:19:25.050,00:19:27.590
"No matter what
your algorithm is,",00:19:27.590,00:19:31.790
"it's going to weigh
some coins and it's",00:19:31.790,00:19:34.000
"going to get an
answer from the scale.",00:19:34.000,00:19:36.310
"And then based on that, it's
going to weigh some other coins",00:19:36.310,00:19:39.350
"and get some answer
from the scale.",00:19:39.350,00:19:42.120
"And it will do some
experiments and then",00:19:42.120,00:19:44.510
it will give you an answer.,00:19:44.510,00:19:46.540
"So if you draw a decision
tree, it would look like this.",00:19:46.540,00:19:50.300
"First, we start
with 0 information.",00:19:50.300,00:19:52.670
We weigh some coins.,00:19:52.670,00:19:54.590
"Based on that, we have
three possible answers--",00:19:54.590,00:19:59.420
"smaller, equal, greater.",00:19:59.420,00:20:03.910
"Now, if we're here, we're
going to do another experiment.",00:20:03.910,00:20:07.260
Three possible answers.,00:20:07.260,00:20:10.910
"If we're here, another
experiment, three possible",00:20:10.910,00:20:13.350

experiment, three possible",00:20:13.850,00:20:16.770
answers.,00:20:16.770,00:20:19.420
Say we do a third experiment.,00:20:19.420,00:20:21.830

three, one, two, three, one,",00:20:21.830,00:20:24.641

three, one, two, three.",00:20:27.863,00:20:30.760
And then suppose we stop.,00:20:30.760,00:20:33.160
"If we stop, we have
to give an answer.",00:20:33.160,00:20:35.620

this is an answer,",00:20:35.620,00:20:37.530
"this is an answer, answer,
answer, answer, answer, answer.",00:20:37.530,00:20:44.880

one, coin two, coin three, all",00:21:29.810,00:21:33.020
the way to coin 30.,00:21:33.020,00:21:34.460
"Here I only have 27
possible answers,",00:21:34.460,00:21:36.960

cut it for 30 coins.",00:21:36.960,00:21:39.297

comparisons instead.",00:21:44.560,00:21:49.230
How many leaves?,00:21:49.230,00:21:51.500
How many possible answers?,00:21:51.500,00:21:53.464
AUDIENCE: h to the third.,00:21:53.464,00:21:55.900
PROFESSOR: Almost.,00:21:55.900,00:21:56.663
AUDIENCE: 3 to the h.,00:21:56.663,00:21:57.538
PROFESSOR: 3 to the h.,00:21:57.538,00:22:00.380
"So 3 multiplied by 3 multiplied
by 3 multiplied by 3 h times,",00:22:00.380,00:22:07.370
so 3 to the h.,00:22:07.370,00:22:09.210
It's no longer equal to 27.,00:22:09.210,00:22:12.210
"3 to the h is the number
of possible answers.",00:22:12.210,00:22:14.425
"This has to be bigger or
equal to N. Otherwise,",00:22:14.425,00:22:17.700
the algorithm is incorrect.,00:22:17.700,00:22:18.885
So what can we say about h?,00:22:21.830,00:22:23.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:22:28.261,00:22:29.177
"PROFESSOR: We did all
this without even thinking",00:22:43.370,00:22:45.740
"of what an algorithm
would look like.",00:22:45.740,00:22:47.940
This works for any algorithm.,00:22:47.940,00:22:49.330
"No matter how smart you are, no
matter how much math you know,",00:22:49.330,00:22:52.820
"your algorithm is going
to be bound by this.",00:22:52.820,00:22:55.940
"So the fact that the
answer looks like this",00:22:55.940,00:22:59.071
"gives you some intuition for
how to solve the problem.",00:22:59.071,00:23:01.320
"If you want to solve the
problem now and figure out",00:23:01.320,00:23:03.445
"the strategy, you know
that you have a 3 here.",00:23:03.445,00:23:06.600
"So if you divide
into 2 every time,",00:23:06.600,00:23:08.430
"you're not going to
get to the right limit.",00:23:08.430,00:23:11.820
"So first you do this,
you get a lower bound,",00:23:11.820,00:23:14.660
"and then you use your
intuition to figure out",00:23:14.660,00:23:18.190
what the lower bound means.,00:23:18.190,00:23:20.110
"In this case, it would mean the
strategy that we heard earlier.",00:23:20.110,00:23:24.170
"You have to divide
into 3 every time",00:23:24.170,00:23:25.750
"and then figure out what you
do based on the comparison.",00:23:25.750,00:23:28.810
"So your answer works
perfectly once we have this.",00:23:28.810,00:23:32.790
"And also, once we
have this, you know",00:23:32.790,00:23:34.389
"that your answer is correct
because it's optimal.",00:23:34.389,00:23:36.430
You can't do better than that.,00:23:36.430,00:23:37.680
Any questions on decision trees?,00:23:40.007,00:23:41.340
"So lower bounds are a
boring topic in general.",00:23:44.590,00:23:47.420
They tell you what you can't do.,00:23:47.420,00:23:48.770
"They don't tell you anything
useful about what you can do.",00:23:48.770,00:23:51.600
"In some cases, being able to
reason about a lower bound",00:23:51.600,00:23:53.900
"gives you a hint
of the solution.",00:23:53.900,00:23:55.274
New problem.,00:24:01.730,00:24:02.230
Suppose we have a 2D map.,00:24:23.340,00:24:26.380
"There's a hill, and you take
a satellite picture of it",00:24:26.380,00:24:29.080
"at night, and you get a picture
with bright pixels and not",00:24:29.080,00:24:33.930
bright pixels.,00:24:33.930,00:24:35.070
"There are numbers showing
how bright your pixels are.",00:24:35.070,00:24:39.540
"1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0.",00:24:39.540,00:24:46.530
"I'm going to draw out an example
so we can use our intuition.",00:24:46.530,00:24:51.645
"0, 0, 1.",00:24:51.645,00:24:55.338
So suppose this is our map.,00:25:13.090,00:25:14.680
"It's W times H-- W
of what these are,",00:25:14.680,00:25:21.660
"I think they're columns,
and H of the other ones.",00:25:21.660,00:25:25.860
"And you want to find a
certain picture inside it.",00:25:25.860,00:25:28.080
"You want to see how many times
does a certain pattern show up.",00:25:28.080,00:25:31.210
"Say the pattern is
small w times small h,",00:25:31.210,00:25:35.470
and it looks like this.,00:25:35.470,00:25:37.740
"But this will be the
input to your problem,",00:25:40.980,00:25:43.374
"so the pattern
might be different.",00:25:43.374,00:25:44.790
You can't hard code this in.,00:25:44.790,00:25:46.660
And this is useful.,00:25:46.660,00:25:48.290
"This problem is called
a bunker hill problem.",00:25:48.290,00:25:50.250
"This is a hill, and
this is a bunker.",00:25:50.250,00:25:53.429
You take a picture of the hill.,00:25:53.429,00:25:54.720
"You want to know
where the bunkers are",00:25:54.720,00:25:55.960
"so you can bomb them at night so
then you can attack the place.",00:25:55.960,00:25:58.670
AUDIENCE: That's awful.,00:25:58.670,00:25:59.660
PROFESSOR: Thank you.,00:25:59.660,00:26:00.645
"I'll take that as a compliment
So a nice way of solving this?",00:26:00.645,00:26:05.670
"AUDIENCE: You could just
go through each row,",00:26:09.963,00:26:13.090
"and then look for a match
for the first row, and then--",00:26:13.090,00:26:15.950
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:26:15.950,00:26:17.212
Is this a match?,00:26:17.212,00:26:18.559
That's what you're saying.,00:26:18.559,00:26:19.642
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:26:19.642,00:26:20.128
We can see that's a match.,00:26:20.128,00:26:21.025
PROFESSOR: Is this a match?,00:26:21.025,00:26:21.320
Is this a match?,00:26:21.320,00:26:22.360
"By the way, this is a match.",00:26:22.360,00:26:24.920
"This is not a match, this is not
a match, this is not a match,",00:26:24.920,00:26:29.960
this is not a match.,00:26:29.960,00:26:30.970
Now we go down here.,00:26:30.970,00:26:32.200
"This is not a match,
this is not a match,",00:26:32.200,00:26:34.560
"this is not a match,
so on and so forth.",00:26:34.560,00:26:37.242
"AUDIENCE: That wasn't
what I was suggesting,",00:26:37.242,00:26:39.075
but that's a good idea.,00:26:39.075,00:26:41.422
"PROFESSOR: Maybe you're
suggesting something smarter,",00:26:41.422,00:26:43.630

let you do something",00:26:43.630,00:26:45.296
"smarter so that we look at the
brute force approach first.",00:26:45.296,00:26:47.932
"AUDIENCE: I mean,
I was just saying",00:26:47.932,00:26:49.390
"take the first row
of your bunker,",00:26:49.390,00:26:51.200
"and then compare
it to other rows,",00:26:51.200,00:26:53.150
"and once you hit that, then
check and see if the rest of--",00:26:53.150,00:26:56.787
"PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a bit smarter,",00:26:56.787,00:26:58.370
"so that's harder
to reason about.",00:26:58.370,00:27:00.300
"Let's take this one and figure
out the running time of it.",00:27:00.300,00:27:04.623
"AUDIENCE: Does that mean even
if you know it's not a match,",00:27:04.623,00:27:07.654
"you keep checking
all nine of them?",00:27:07.654,00:27:10.114
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:27:10.114,00:27:10.780
"Say at the worst case,
you only find out",00:27:10.780,00:27:12.500
"it's not a match all
the way at the end.",00:27:12.500,00:27:14.232
"AUDIENCE: Are you trying to look
for all matches or just one?",00:27:16.895,00:27:19.436
PROFESSOR: All matches.,00:27:19.436,00:27:22.560
"AUDIENCE: You're limited to n
squared time almost no matter",00:27:22.560,00:27:25.155
"what, right?",00:27:25.155,00:27:26.755
"If you have a small
bunker in a large field,",00:27:26.755,00:27:29.270

small bunker every time.",00:27:29.270,00:27:32.210

solve the problem for me?",00:27:32.210,00:27:34.720

solve this first,",00:27:42.420,00:27:44.150
"and then let's get to the
efficient algorithm, OK?",00:27:44.150,00:27:46.870
"AUDIENCE: Big W minus
small w plus 1 times big H",00:27:46.870,00:27:50.580
minus small h plus 1.,00:27:50.580,00:27:52.080
"AUDIENCE: Where'd
you get plus 1 from?",00:27:55.080,00:27:57.080
AUDIENCE: So it's WH?,00:27:59.582,00:28:01.064
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:28:01.064,00:28:02.101
"PROFESSOR: Well, there's
something missing here.",00:28:02.101,00:28:04.100
"This is how many positions I
have that I have to look at.",00:28:04.100,00:28:08.250
"How much time does it take
to compare the small images?",00:28:08.250,00:28:11.014
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:28:11.014,00:28:11.930
"PROFESSOR: This is smaller than
wh, which is the input size,",00:28:15.860,00:28:18.800
"so it's scary if you have an
algorithm that runs faster",00:28:18.800,00:28:21.120
"than the input size
because it means",00:28:21.120,00:28:24.010
"you're not looking
at all the input.",00:28:24.010,00:28:25.926
"So this is definitely
bigger than the input size",00:28:34.641,00:28:36.640
once we add the w times h here.,00:28:36.640,00:28:38.530
Don't forget this guy.,00:28:38.530,00:28:39.555
"This is the naive algorithm, and
if we discard the small order",00:28:42.590,00:28:48.700
"factors, we get that
this is order of WHwh.",00:28:48.700,00:28:51.012
How can you do better?,00:28:53.950,00:28:56.420
"You have the answer, right?",00:28:56.420,00:28:59.240

think for a minute,",00:28:59.240,00:29:01.850

the answer if you want,",00:29:01.850,00:29:04.300
"or someone else can
give me the answer.",00:29:04.300,00:29:06.620
"I guess you should because
you thought of it first.",00:29:08.955,00:29:11.079
Any ideas?,00:29:17.070,00:29:17.780
"So you're thinking about
the input size, right?",00:29:23.620,00:29:28.010
"Someone was thinking
about the input size.",00:29:28.010,00:29:32.160
"So the input size
is W times H, right?",00:29:32.160,00:29:34.680
"So if I have an algorithm
that's W times H,",00:29:34.680,00:29:36.519
"that's optimal because it
has to look at all the input.",00:29:36.519,00:29:38.810
"Well, we're going to
have an algorithm that's",00:29:42.016,00:29:43.890
"W times H, so with
that out of the way,",00:29:43.890,00:29:47.990
"does that inspire anyone
as to what the solution is?",00:29:47.990,00:29:51.000
"AUDIENCE: Do that thing
that I was saying,",00:29:58.485,00:30:00.510
"just take the first row, but
then you still have a W term.",00:30:00.510,00:30:03.704
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:30:03.704,00:30:04.370
So let's make it better.,00:30:04.370,00:30:07.470
It is the correct intuition.,00:30:07.470,00:30:09.250
"Now try to use a trick we
learned in lecture to make that",00:30:09.250,00:30:11.920
faster.,00:30:11.920,00:30:12.420
"AUDIENCE: Just use
the top left corner",00:30:17.233,00:30:18.816
instead of the whole row.,00:30:18.816,00:30:21.527
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:30:21.527,00:30:22.110
"So we could use the
top left corner,",00:30:22.110,00:30:24.110
"and if the top left
corner doesn't match,",00:30:24.110,00:30:26.590
"then we don't have
to check for matches.",00:30:26.590,00:30:30.630
"So this works for
reasonably random data.",00:30:30.630,00:30:33.300
"As long as we don't have
a lot of false positives,",00:30:33.300,00:30:35.630
we're going to run fast.,00:30:35.630,00:30:38.040
"Now, the top corner of
this one, if the map",00:30:38.040,00:30:43.450
"has a lot of 1's and then some
2's sprinkled all over it,",00:30:43.450,00:30:47.820
"most of the time, we'll have
to go through the whole image",00:30:47.820,00:30:51.370
"so we're going to have a
lot of false positives.",00:30:51.370,00:30:54.190
"How do we make our false
positive rate go down?",00:30:54.190,00:30:59.180
"AUDIENCE: Looks kind of
like a rolling hash problem.",00:30:59.180,00:31:01.680

rolling hash problem, exactly.",00:31:01.680,00:31:04.580
"Let's see if we can
use rolling hashes.",00:31:04.580,00:31:07.147

still have that lowercase w",00:31:07.147,00:31:09.230
"term, though.",00:31:09.230,00:31:11.022

we get rid of it?",00:31:11.022,00:31:12.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:31:15.204,00:31:16.182
PROFESSOR: Sorry?,00:31:16.182,00:31:16.890
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it be w?,00:31:21.633,00:31:22.758
"I mean the running time if we
were just going through one row",00:31:22.758,00:31:25.936
"would be big W minus
little w, times--",00:31:25.936,00:31:29.115
"PROFESSOR: So where's
your rolling hash?",00:31:31.534,00:31:33.200
"AUDIENCE: I guess you can use
the entire thing as a hash,",00:31:37.768,00:31:40.143
too.,00:31:40.143,00:31:40.643
That would kind of work.,00:31:40.643,00:31:42.970
"PROFESSOR: So we want a
hash for the whole thing.",00:31:42.970,00:31:45.330
"Instead of using this as the
hash, we want a smarter hash.",00:31:45.330,00:31:50.928
"AUDIENCE: It's the
entire thing, and then",00:31:50.928,00:31:53.880
"as you move to the right, you
can add those and subtract,",00:31:53.880,00:31:58.308
and compare that with the hash.,00:31:58.308,00:32:01.487
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:32:01.487,00:32:02.070
"So we'd have a rolling hash
that has everything in here,",00:32:02.070,00:32:05.510
"and then as I move to the
right, I add these guys",00:32:05.510,00:32:08.640
and I remove these guys.,00:32:08.640,00:32:09.710
"This is big W times big
H, roughly, times small h",00:32:12.730,00:32:19.400
"because every time
I move to the right,",00:32:19.400,00:32:21.470
I have to do order h work.,00:32:21.470,00:32:25.090
"So I'm down from this
thing to order of WHh,",00:32:25.090,00:32:32.260

It's one step forward.,00:32:33.590,00:32:34.590

this even faster.",00:32:34.590,00:32:35.990
"What if I could do this in
order 1 instead of order h?",00:32:47.420,00:32:53.810
How would I do this in order 1?,00:32:57.790,00:33:00.114

hashes of the three columns,",00:33:26.050,00:33:29.980

"You'd still have to access
each of those items.",00:33:33.290,00:33:36.146

how it's faster.",00:33:36.146,00:33:39.800
"I guess it's less, though.",00:33:39.800,00:33:41.380
It's less.,00:33:41.380,00:33:42.340
Maybe it's only 1.,00:33:42.340,00:33:43.300
"AUDIENCE: So do you want to hash
each little column [INAUDIBLE]?",00:33:47.630,00:33:53.970

to hash all these guys,",00:34:01.200,00:34:03.950
"and then we're going to
have hashes for them,",00:34:03.950,00:34:06.340
"and we're going to do
the regular Rabin-Karp",00:34:06.340,00:34:10.590
for the hashes.,00:34:10.590,00:34:13.420

when I go down?",00:34:13.420,00:34:16.478

recompute everything.",00:34:16.478,00:34:18.840

than recompute everything.",00:34:18.840,00:34:20.024
"AUDIENCE: Do you want
to [INAUDIBLE] downward",00:34:20.024,00:34:21.241
on each column?,00:34:21.241,00:34:21.540
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:34:21.540,00:34:22.165
Rolling hash.,00:34:22.165,00:34:23.489
"I want to make this faster,
so I have big W hashes.",00:34:23.489,00:34:28.199
They're all little h inside.,00:34:28.199,00:34:30.610
"Here, I have to compute
them brute force.",00:34:30.610,00:34:32.360
I can't do anything better.,00:34:32.360,00:34:33.485
"But when I go from
here to here, there's",00:34:33.485,00:34:36.250
"only one element going out
and one element going in.",00:34:36.250,00:34:39.394
Same for all these guys.,00:34:42.070,00:34:43.310
"Let's not make the picture
uglier than it needs to be.",00:34:43.310,00:34:46.080
So I have big W rolling hashes.,00:34:46.080,00:34:48.960
They're vertical rolling hashes.,00:34:48.960,00:34:51.340

little w rolling hashes.",00:34:59.310,00:35:03.230
"Each rolling hash is little h in
size, so it's a hash of hashes.",00:35:03.230,00:35:10.320
It's nested hashes.,00:35:10.320,00:35:12.000
"And then when I go
down, I only have",00:35:12.000,00:35:14.410
"to roll down each of
the rolling hashes by 1,",00:35:14.410,00:35:17.950
so that's constant time.,00:35:17.950,00:35:19.300
"So to go from here to here, to
the slide the window one down,",00:35:19.300,00:35:24.630
"I have to roll this hash
down, roll this one,",00:35:24.630,00:35:27.330

this one, and all of them",00:35:27.330,00:35:29.640
roll down in constant time.,00:35:29.640,00:35:31.640
"So when I'm adding a column
to the hash, say I'm here",00:35:31.640,00:35:36.640
"and I want to go here,
I roll down this hash",00:35:36.640,00:35:40.380
and I have the answer.,00:35:40.380,00:35:42.560
It's order 1.,00:35:42.560,00:35:43.210
I'm adding it in order 1.,00:35:43.210,00:35:45.360
Does this make sense?,00:35:47.726,00:35:48.600
AUDIENCE: It's tricky.,00:35:55.087,00:35:58.572
"PROFESSOR: But it's
not too bad, right?",00:35:58.572,00:36:00.196

"So my memory requirement
went up to 4W.",00:36:29.840,00:36:32.500
Is everyone happy with this?,00:36:39.850,00:36:41.670
"It's one of the few cases where
an approach for solving a 1D",00:36:41.670,00:36:46.340

"In most problems, you have to
rethink the whole situation.",00:36:48.670,00:36:51.630
Let's do a hard problem.,00:37:02.980,00:37:04.497
Enough with the easy ones.,00:37:04.497,00:37:05.580
"Two lists, roughly size N,

"Let's be generous and say that
all the numbers are different.",00:37:58.700,00:38:01.810

"AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
it just be index?",00:38:19.274,00:38:22.680
"PROFESSOR: So the thing is
if, for example, n is 1,",00:38:22.680,00:38:26.470
then it's this.,00:38:26.470,00:38:27.990
This is the second number.,00:38:27.990,00:38:29.140
This is the third.,00:38:29.140,00:38:31.884

So what do we do?,00:38:47.160,00:38:47.610
AUDIENCE: We just do merge.,00:38:47.610,00:38:48.260
That's just order N.,00:38:48.260,00:38:49.560

AUDIENCE: Merge [INAUDIBLE].,00:38:51.182,00:38:53.050
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:38:53.050,00:38:54.760
"So merge and then index
is the first approach,",00:38:54.760,00:38:58.230
"which is order N. Then you
said run the merge algorithm,",00:38:58.230,00:39:01.840
"but stop when you get to
the little nth element,",00:39:01.840,00:39:07.052

better and we don't have",00:39:07.052,00:39:09.010

complexity is down to order 1,",00:39:09.010,00:39:12.490

This is linear.,00:39:18.575,00:39:19.200
We have to get to logarithms.,00:39:19.200,00:39:20.810

idea [INAUDIBLE].",00:39:51.350,00:39:53.665
"PROFESSOR: Let's see
how it would work.",00:39:53.665,00:39:55.290
"AUDIENCE: So if we take
the n over second element",00:39:58.530,00:40:11.530
"on each row, the
one that is lower,",00:40:11.530,00:40:19.628
"that's at least the n
over second element,",00:40:19.628,00:40:22.600
and the one that's higher--,00:40:22.600,00:40:23.725

this is our N1 and N2,",00:40:35.230,00:40:38.415
"and they're both
order N initially.",00:40:38.415,00:40:41.330
"So this is N2 over 2
if this is smaller.",00:40:41.330,00:40:45.010
"AUDIENCE: The lower
one is at least",00:40:48.328,00:40:49.786
"the N over second
element since everything",00:40:49.786,00:40:51.790

N. Does that make sense?",00:40:51.790,00:41:03.844
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:41:03.844,00:41:04.510
"So this is N over 2
are greater, right?",00:41:04.510,00:41:07.140
This guy.,00:41:07.140,00:41:07.840
"AUDIENCE: We also know
that the element above it",00:41:16.030,00:41:28.859
"is at most the nth element
because it's greater than--",00:41:28.859,00:41:35.316
"PROFESSOR: So it's
at most N1 plus N2",00:41:35.316,00:41:37.620
"because that's how
many you have in total,",00:41:37.620,00:41:39.370
"and the one on the top, you
know that these ones are",00:41:39.370,00:41:44.150
"bigger than h, right?",00:41:44.150,00:41:45.520
"But you don't know
anything about these ones,",00:41:45.520,00:41:47.850
so it's minus N1 over 2.,00:41:47.850,00:41:52.360
"So it's at most N1 over 2
plus N2, the top element.",00:41:52.360,00:41:56.700
"AUDIENCE: So then we can take
the element three quarters",00:41:59.590,00:42:06.860
"of the way through N2 and
one quarter of the way",00:42:06.860,00:42:09.992

more [INAUDIBLE].",00:42:09.992,00:42:13.934

AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:42:17.722,00:42:18.305
"PROFESSOR: Let's see what
happens in each case.",00:42:22.962,00:42:24.920
"So if little n is
here, then you divide.",00:42:24.920,00:42:34.270
"So if n is smaller than this,
then you chop them up here",00:42:34.270,00:42:41.490
"and you've divided
the problem into half.",00:42:41.490,00:42:43.860

"Now, the hard case seems
to be when it's in between.",00:42:53.500,00:42:56.100

two numbers the same?",00:42:57.690,00:42:59.854

am I going to know",00:45:42.007,00:45:43.590
the rank that I'm looking for?,00:45:43.590,00:45:45.520

save the branches.",00:45:55.700,00:45:57.520
"PROFESSOR: So you want
to kill this guy, right?",00:45:57.520,00:45:59.560
"So you want to
kill these numbers.",00:45:59.560,00:46:01.970
"But here I have
k over 2 numbers,",00:46:01.970,00:46:04.330
"and here I have
k over 2 numbers.",00:46:04.330,00:46:06.130
"How do I know that it's
not somewhere here?",00:46:06.130,00:46:09.401
"AUDIENCE: How do you know that
what's not somewhere there?",00:46:09.401,00:46:13.562
"AUDIENCE: You compare
15 and 43, right?",00:46:13.562,00:46:16.220
"And then you see
that 43 is bigger,",00:46:16.220,00:46:19.660
"and you see 15 is smaller, so
then you would go to, I guess,",00:46:19.660,00:46:26.300
"k over 4 index in N1,
and 3k over 4 in N2.",00:46:26.300,00:46:36.195
"AUDIENCE: When you
recurse, you said",00:46:36.195,00:46:37.695
"that you've killed
k over 2 elements.",00:46:37.695,00:46:41.430
"AUDIENCE: But you can also kill
everything to the right of 43.",00:46:41.430,00:46:46.947
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:46:46.947,00:46:47.530
"You can kill everything
to the right of 43",00:46:47.530,00:46:50.015
"since it can't be any
of those elements,",00:46:50.015,00:46:51.754
"and you can kill everything
to the left of 15.",00:46:51.754,00:46:53.670
"And then you repeat the
algorithm again with the lists",00:46:53.670,00:46:57.236
"you didn't kill, except you
also put in a term of we've",00:46:57.236,00:47:00.210
"already covered k
over 2 elements.",00:47:00.210,00:47:03.950
"PROFESSOR: So we want the
element with the rank k over 4",00:47:03.950,00:47:07.570
over these lists.,00:47:07.570,00:47:08.715
"So I know for sure that what
I have is either k over 2",00:47:13.646,00:47:16.330
"or less than k over 2, right?",00:47:16.330,00:47:21.240
"So this is less than
k over 2, and then I'm",00:47:21.240,00:47:23.710
looking for a rank of k over 4.,00:47:23.710,00:47:25.532
That seems to work.,00:47:28.184,00:47:30.250
How does the running time look?,00:47:30.250,00:47:33.540
"AUDIENCE: It should
be O of log k.",00:47:33.540,00:47:38.030
"AUDIENCE: I think
it's log [INAUDIBLE].",00:47:38.030,00:47:40.530
"PROFESSOR: So log
k, log N1 plus N2.",00:47:45.030,00:47:52.609
Are these different?,00:47:57.440,00:47:58.620
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:47:58.620,00:48:00.830
"AUDIENCE: If k is
1, the algorithm",00:48:00.830,00:48:06.406
"should only recurse once,
even if N is 20 million.",00:48:06.406,00:48:10.084
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:48:16.220,00:48:18.364
"AUDIENCE: But if k is 20
million and the list lengths are",00:48:18.364,00:48:21.902
"two million long, it'll take
approximately those lengths",00:48:21.902,00:48:24.784
to run.,00:48:24.784,00:48:26.740
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:48:26.740,00:48:28.690
"So what gets reduced, aside from
the list size, k gets reduced.",00:48:28.690,00:48:36.420
"k seems to define the input
size for the next iteration",00:48:36.420,00:48:39.870
"because I'll have at least
k over 2 elements in one",00:48:39.870,00:48:42.700
of these buckets.,00:48:42.700,00:48:45.640
"So it sounds like
it should be log k.",00:48:45.640,00:48:48.250
"k is bigger than N1, N2, but
it should hopefully be smaller",00:48:56.120,00:49:00.390
"than the sum because otherwise,
why am I doing the problem?",00:49:00.390,00:49:03.740
"So this is definitely
order of N1 plus N2.",00:49:03.740,00:49:08.360
So this is a bound.,00:49:08.360,00:49:09.390
"This is a slightly
tighter bound.",00:49:09.390,00:49:11.820
"We have a different
solution to the problem.",00:49:11.820,00:49:13.665
"All the possible solutions
are hard to argue.",00:49:16.945,00:49:18.820
"They all come down to
something like this.",00:49:18.820,00:49:21.540
"The one that we have
requires you to use-- you",00:49:21.540,00:49:26.070
"have two indices, and you know
that the sum of the indices",00:49:26.070,00:49:29.873
"is k, and you do binary
search on the top",00:49:29.873,00:49:33.580
"and adjust the
index on the bottom",00:49:33.580,00:49:36.090
"to keep the constraint that the
sum of the two indices in N.",00:49:36.090,00:49:40.040
"And you can look at that in the
notes that we're going to post.",00:49:40.040,00:49:44.620
Are you guys tired?,00:49:44.620,00:49:45.780

more thing, or are we done?",00:49:45.780,00:49:49.509

"I'm not going to
bore you with that.",00:50:03.350,00:50:04.910

to do this from Pset one?",00:50:16.070,00:50:19.480

each function, you simplify it,",00:50:19.480,00:50:22.400
and then you sort them.,00:50:22.400,00:50:23.970

log n, so it's log 2 n.",00:52:53.090,00:53:05.020
