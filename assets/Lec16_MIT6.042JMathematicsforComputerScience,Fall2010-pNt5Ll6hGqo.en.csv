"PROFESSOR: So this week we are
going to talk about counting.",00:00:22.800,00:00:27.050
"Tonight is a problem
set eight due.",00:00:27.050,00:00:32.009
"For this week, we will post
a new problem set tonight",00:00:32.009,00:00:34.910
as well.,00:00:34.910,00:00:36.940
Counting is very important.,00:00:36.940,00:00:39.190
"The rest of the semester
after this week,",00:00:39.190,00:00:41.130
"we will actually explain
probability theory.",00:00:41.130,00:00:44.499
And it's all based on counting.,00:00:44.499,00:00:45.790
"So I'm going to
teach you this week",00:00:48.440,00:00:51.710
"a whole toolkit of all
kinds of ways how to count.",00:00:51.710,00:00:54.690
"And as you can see,
we're going to talk",00:00:54.690,00:00:56.960
"about a lot of different
kinds of rules.",00:00:56.960,00:00:59.020
"A mapping rule we'll
talk about, the pigeon",00:00:59.020,00:01:03.100
"hole principle, another
rule, the product rule",00:01:03.100,00:01:05.300
and the sum rule.,00:01:05.300,00:01:06.620
"And these are all ways
to count one thing",00:01:06.620,00:01:10.100
by counting another thing.,00:01:10.100,00:01:11.332
"Actually, what we are
going to talk about",00:01:11.332,00:01:13.040
"is how to count a
difficult set the objects.",00:01:13.040,00:01:19.080
"And we will map those
objects to something",00:01:19.080,00:01:21.130
"that we can count in
a much easier way.",00:01:21.130,00:01:24.930
OK.,00:01:24.930,00:01:25.430
"So let's start with a lot
of definitions actually.",00:01:25.430,00:01:28.780
"So we have to talk about sets,
sequences, and permutations",00:01:28.780,00:01:33.980
to start off with.,00:01:33.980,00:01:35.960
"So the definition of
a set is as follows.",00:01:35.960,00:01:42.640
"A set is actually an
unordered collection",00:01:42.640,00:01:51.450
of distinct elements.,00:01:51.450,00:01:52.835
"So as an example,
we may have, say,",00:02:01.180,00:02:05.970
"a set that contains the
elements a, b, and c.",00:02:05.970,00:02:11.120
"Well, if you reorder
these elements,",00:02:11.120,00:02:12.649
it doesn't really matter.,00:02:12.649,00:02:13.690
It's still the same set.,00:02:13.690,00:02:14.980
"We can also write it
as the set c, a, b.",00:02:14.980,00:02:19.640
"On the other hand if you
have a collection in which",00:02:19.640,00:02:22.820
"say the elements
a appears twice,",00:02:22.820,00:02:26.650
"well, these two
are not distinct.",00:02:26.650,00:02:28.970
So this is not a set.,00:02:28.970,00:02:31.270
So this is not a set.,00:02:31.270,00:02:32.500
But it is a collection.,00:02:32.500,00:02:34.801
"And you may call
this a multiset.",00:02:34.801,00:02:36.175
But we'll not go into that.,00:02:36.175,00:02:38.350
"So we will be
talking about sets.",00:02:38.350,00:02:40.550
"And your interested usually
in the cardinality of a set.",00:02:40.550,00:02:43.930
So what's that?,00:02:43.930,00:02:45.860
"The cardinality or size
is defined as follows.",00:02:45.860,00:02:52.410
"Cardinality is just
a number of elements",00:02:55.000,00:03:04.470
that the set S really has.,00:03:04.470,00:03:06.590
"So it's a number
of elements in S.",00:03:06.590,00:03:16.020
"And how do we denote this/ This
is denoted by two vertical bars",00:03:16.020,00:03:22.550
"around the letter that
represents the set.",00:03:22.550,00:03:27.740
So we denote this as follows.,00:03:27.740,00:03:30.520
"Now, when we talk
about sets, we may also",00:03:30.520,00:03:33.260
"be interested in ordered
collection of elements.",00:03:33.260,00:03:37.940
"And that's what we
call a sequence.",00:03:37.940,00:03:40.820
"So a sequence is
defined as follows.",00:03:40.820,00:03:44.440
"A sequence is an ordered
collection of elements.",00:03:44.440,00:04:00.170
"And we also call these
elements components or terms.",00:04:00.170,00:04:04.570
"And these elements
do not necessarily",00:04:12.810,00:04:16.839
"have to be distinct-- so
not necessarily distinct.",00:04:16.839,00:04:27.360
"Now as an example, so
how do we denote this?",00:04:27.360,00:04:29.400
"For sets, we use this type
of notation like this symbol.",00:04:29.400,00:04:36.520
"For sequences, we just have a
very simple type of bracket,",00:04:36.520,00:04:40.270
just a round bracket.,00:04:40.270,00:04:42.630
"So an example could be, well,
the elements a, b, and c.",00:04:42.630,00:04:49.240
"The first entry
or the first term",00:04:49.240,00:04:51.280
"of the sequence-- depending
on whether you look",00:04:51.280,00:04:53.760
"at it from the left or
the right, it may differ--",00:04:53.760,00:04:57.040
"is here a, b, and then c.",00:04:57.040,00:05:01.140
"Another one could
be a, b, and a.",00:05:01.140,00:05:03.810
"And as you can see, the element
a occurs twice in the sequence.",00:05:03.810,00:05:06.840
"So we're going to relate
sets and sequences.",00:05:10.700,00:05:13.980
"And let's talk about
the permutation.",00:05:13.980,00:05:18.080
"So a permutation of a set
is defined as follows.",00:05:18.080,00:05:21.450
"A permutation of a
set S is actually",00:05:28.500,00:05:36.080
"a sequence that contains every
element in S exactly once.",00:05:36.080,00:05:44.150
"So every element in S
occurs exactly once.",00:05:55.250,00:05:58.515
"And as an example, we may
look at the set that we have",00:06:03.280,00:06:08.260
"described over here,
the set a,b, and c.",00:06:08.260,00:06:11.930
"And how many
permutations are there?",00:06:11.930,00:06:16.530
"So the first one I may just
order the elements in a, b,",00:06:16.530,00:06:22.736
and c.,00:06:22.736,00:06:23.430
"So I have, say, the sequence
a and then b, and then c.",00:06:23.430,00:06:28.020
There are many more.,00:06:28.020,00:06:29.330
"I can, for example,
start with b, and then c,",00:06:29.330,00:06:33.990
and then may cycle through to a.,00:06:33.990,00:06:36.530
"That's another permutation
of these three elements.",00:06:36.530,00:06:40.844
And I can do this once more.,00:06:40.844,00:06:42.010
"I can, for example, start with
c, and then a, and then b.",00:06:42.010,00:06:49.760
"And it turns out that
we can do a few more.",00:06:49.760,00:06:53.150
"You can also start to c,
and then b, and then a.",00:06:53.150,00:06:56.140
"We sort of reversed
the order that we",00:06:56.140,00:07:00.140
"had over here into its opposite,
so first c, then b, then a.",00:07:00.140,00:07:05.070
"And we can look at
this cycle there.",00:07:05.070,00:07:07.390
There's shifts.,00:07:07.390,00:07:08.480
"And we start with b, a,
and then we rotate through",00:07:08.480,00:07:11.260
"to c, which is what
we did over here",00:07:11.260,00:07:14.060
"when you went from this
permutation to this one.",00:07:14.060,00:07:17.050
"So we have to b, a, and then c.",00:07:17.050,00:07:19.700
"And then we may start with
a, and we have a, c, and b.",00:07:19.700,00:07:25.410
"It turns out that
this is actually",00:07:25.410,00:07:28.910
"all the possible
permutations of this set.",00:07:28.910,00:07:32.100
So there's six of these.,00:07:32.100,00:07:36.202
"And in general, how
many permutations",00:07:36.202,00:07:39.950
"are there of a
set of n elements?",00:07:39.950,00:07:42.760
"So let's have a look
here what we did.",00:07:42.760,00:07:46.340
"So if I want to create
a permutation of a set,",00:07:46.340,00:07:50.020
"I may start off by selecting for
the first term a, and b, or c.",00:07:50.020,00:07:56.110
"So I have actually
three choices.",00:07:56.110,00:07:58.800
"So the first term
has three choices.",00:07:58.800,00:08:06.015
"The second term over
here, well, for example,",00:08:09.200,00:08:12.010
suppose my first term was b.,00:08:12.010,00:08:14.910
"Then the second
term, well, must be",00:08:14.910,00:08:17.940
"an element that is different
from b, as yet part of S.",00:08:17.940,00:08:21.880
"So I have only two choices for
the second term, either c or a.",00:08:21.880,00:08:27.450
"So the second term
has two choices.",00:08:27.450,00:08:32.400
"And once I have chosen
the second one, well,",00:08:32.400,00:08:35.309
"if I've already chosen
b and c, there's",00:08:35.309,00:08:37.960
"only one element left in
the set over here, only a.",00:08:37.960,00:08:42.150
So I have only one choice left.,00:08:42.150,00:08:44.480
"So in this way, we may count
the total number of permutations",00:08:44.480,00:08:48.740
"of this set as the
number of choices",00:08:48.740,00:08:50.820
"that I have for the first term
times the number of choices",00:08:50.820,00:08:54.270
"for the second term,
3 times 2 times",00:08:54.270,00:08:57.350
"the number of choices for the
third term, which is only one.",00:08:57.350,00:09:00.520
"So the third term
has only one choice.",00:09:00.520,00:09:10.540
"Now in general, we can do
this for any permutation.",00:09:10.540,00:09:14.520
"And if you want to count
the number of permutations,",00:09:14.520,00:09:21.860
"of a set with n
elements, well, it",00:09:21.860,00:09:31.020
"turns out that it's equal to n
times n minus 1 just like here.",00:09:31.020,00:09:34.920
"We have three elements,
3 times 3 minus 1",00:09:34.920,00:09:38.120
"and so on, n times n
minus 1 times n minus 2,",00:09:38.120,00:09:41.380
et cetera all the way up to one.,00:09:41.380,00:09:47.620
And this is n factorial.,00:09:47.620,00:09:49.550
"And you've seen
this already when",00:09:49.550,00:09:51.290
"we talked about
Stirling's formula",00:09:51.290,00:09:53.180
and how to approximate this.,00:09:53.180,00:09:55.731
"Now, this type of
reasoning we will",00:09:55.731,00:09:57.620
"generalize later on when we
come to the Generalized Product",00:09:57.620,00:10:01.600
rule.,00:10:01.600,00:10:02.770
"And But this is
already a first example",00:10:02.770,00:10:05.590
of how we go about this.,00:10:05.590,00:10:08.350
"So permutations relates
sets and sequences.",00:10:08.350,00:10:13.470
"So now we go on to define
more special functions.",00:10:13.470,00:10:16.970
"So permutations is
one kind of mapping.",00:10:16.970,00:10:19.640
So let's now define functions.,00:10:19.640,00:10:22.770
"And then we will talk about a
few different flavors of those.",00:10:22.770,00:10:29.440
"We talk about surjective
functions, injective functions,",00:10:29.440,00:10:32.070
and bijective functions.,00:10:32.070,00:10:33.920
"And the whole idea is is that
if I can use a mapping from one",00:10:33.920,00:10:39.360
"set to another set
that satisfies some",00:10:39.360,00:10:43.500
"of those properties,
it can say something",00:10:43.500,00:10:45.600
"about how their
cardinalities are related.",00:10:45.600,00:10:48.630
And that's what we want.,00:10:48.630,00:10:49.680
We want to count.,00:10:49.680,00:10:51.440
"OK So the definition of
a function is as follows.",00:10:51.440,00:10:56.035
"So a function f from
x to y is actually",00:11:00.220,00:11:06.050
"a relation between
the sets X and Y.",00:11:06.050,00:11:18.730
"And we say that--
oh-- with the property",00:11:18.730,00:11:24.190
"that every single element,
every element, of X",00:11:24.190,00:11:31.890
"is actually related to
exactly one element of Y.",00:11:31.890,00:11:50.070
"And we will call x to be the
domain of the function f.",00:11:50.070,00:11:59.920
"And Y we will call the range
or image of the function f.",00:11:59.920,00:12:06.860
So let's give an example.,00:12:06.860,00:12:08.670
"And to see a couple of
examples of, first of all,",00:12:08.670,00:12:13.400
"a function and then
relations to that",00:12:13.400,00:12:16.765
are actually not functions.,00:12:16.765,00:12:18.680
"So suppose you have a mapping
from x which just contains",00:12:18.680,00:12:22.980
"the elements a, b,
and c, just in line",00:12:22.980,00:12:25.130
with this example over here.,00:12:25.130,00:12:26.795
"And we have a mapping f
that maps to the set y.",00:12:26.795,00:12:34.410
"And the y is just the
numbers 1, 2, and 3.",00:12:34.410,00:12:37.840
"Well, i could map, for example,
a to 1, b to 3, and c to 3.",00:12:37.840,00:12:46.050
Now this is a function.,00:12:46.050,00:12:47.660
"Because every element of x
is met to exactly one element",00:12:47.660,00:12:52.450
of y. a is just mapped to 1.,00:12:52.450,00:12:55.360
"b is also mapped to
an element, only 3.",00:12:55.360,00:12:58.120
c is mapped to 3 as well.,00:12:58.120,00:13:00.930
"And they usually write this as
f evaluated in a is equal to 1.",00:13:00.930,00:13:07.730
And f b is equal to 3.,00:13:07.730,00:13:11.090
"And f of c is
equal to 3 as well.",00:13:11.090,00:13:14.960
"Now what is not a
function-- oh, I",00:13:14.960,00:13:16.643
"could, for example, add another
edge over here if I wanted to.",00:13:16.643,00:13:20.205
But this is not a function.,00:13:20.205,00:13:21.330
"Because b is now mapped
to two elements, 2 and 3.",00:13:21.330,00:13:25.440
"And that's not what's
covered by this definition.",00:13:25.440,00:13:27.610
So this is not a function.,00:13:27.610,00:13:30.050
"I can also remove, say, an edge.",00:13:30.050,00:13:32.670
"Well, in this case, b is not
mapped to anything at all.",00:13:32.670,00:13:35.380
"And that's not a
function either.",00:13:35.380,00:13:37.050
"So we really have the
property for functions",00:13:37.050,00:13:40.180
"that there is six exactly
one outgoing arrow,",00:13:40.180,00:13:42.520
"if you want to think
about it as being a graph,",00:13:42.520,00:13:47.740
"from each element in x to
exactly one element in y.",00:13:47.740,00:13:54.680
"So now we can talk
about a few definitions.",00:13:54.680,00:13:57.455
"So we will talk about these
few properties, surjective,",00:14:01.580,00:14:05.400
"injective, and bijective.",00:14:05.400,00:14:07.280
"And then we can start to do
a few interesting examples.",00:14:07.280,00:14:12.770
"So a function f that goes from
x to y is called surjective.",00:14:12.770,00:14:17.505
"if every single element of y
is mapped to at least once.",00:14:21.640,00:14:45.190
So what does that mean?,00:14:45.190,00:14:47.840
To at least once.,00:14:47.840,00:14:49.250
"So every element of y, so
say 1 for example here,",00:14:53.170,00:14:59.380
is mapped to at least once.,00:14:59.380,00:15:01.340
"Well, to the element
1 we have mapped a.",00:15:01.340,00:15:05.790
So that's great.,00:15:05.790,00:15:06.520
"But for example element 2
is not mapped to at all.",00:15:06.520,00:15:10.710
"So this particular
example is not surjective.",00:15:10.710,00:15:13.070
"But we will come to a
few examples that are.",00:15:13.070,00:15:15.240
"So here we have the distinction
that every element of y,",00:15:15.240,00:15:18.790
"so every single element of y,
is mapped to at least once.",00:15:18.790,00:15:23.920
"The injective is defined
in a similar fashion.",00:15:23.920,00:15:30.160
"But now, every element
of y is not mapped to",00:15:30.160,00:15:33.220
"at least once, but at most once.",00:15:33.220,00:15:35.850
So let's have look over here.,00:15:40.110,00:15:41.535
"And that's also not true
for this example actually.",00:15:41.535,00:15:43.660
"Because three is
mapped to two times.",00:15:43.660,00:15:48.120
"So it's not mapped
to at most once.",00:15:48.120,00:15:50.250
"So this example is
also not injective.",00:15:50.250,00:15:53.510
"Because if the
function is injective,",00:15:53.510,00:15:55.620
"every element of y of the range
is mapped to at most once.",00:15:55.620,00:16:00.350
"Bijective is if every element
of y is mapped to exactly once.",00:16:00.350,00:16:09.545
"And we can see that the
function is bijective if",00:16:14.110,00:16:18.910
"and only if it is both
surjective and injective.",00:16:18.910,00:16:22.070
"So bijective if and only if
we have both the properties",00:16:22.070,00:16:28.920
surjectvie as well as injective.,00:16:28.920,00:16:34.550
"So let's give a
couple of examples.",00:16:34.550,00:16:36.495
"So as the first example, we
may have the set x and y.",00:16:44.510,00:16:49.090
"We have 1, 2, and 3, and set it
to elements a and b over here.",00:16:49.090,00:16:54.780
"1 is mapped to a, 2 is mapped
to a, and 3 is mapped to b.",00:16:54.780,00:17:00.330
"And now we can see
that every element in y",00:17:00.330,00:17:03.020
is mapped to at least once.,00:17:03.020,00:17:04.440
This one is mapped to two times.,00:17:04.440,00:17:05.800
This one is mapped to once.,00:17:05.800,00:17:07.750
"So this one is
actually surjective.",00:17:07.750,00:17:10.490
So that's great.,00:17:10.490,00:17:12.760
"Another example of
something this is injective",00:17:12.760,00:17:16.380
"is if you have, say, 1, 2,
and 3, and a, b, c, and d.",00:17:16.380,00:17:22.148
"1 is mapped, say, to a.",00:17:22.148,00:17:25.020
"2 to b, 3 to d.",00:17:25.020,00:17:27.420
"Well, in this case we
have that it's injective.",00:17:27.420,00:17:30.320
"Because every element of y
is mapped to at most once,",00:17:30.320,00:17:34.614
"once, once, zero
times, and once.",00:17:34.614,00:17:37.140
So this one is injective.,00:17:37.140,00:17:39.340
"And this one is not
injective, right?",00:17:39.340,00:17:41.300
"Because this one is
mapped to 2 times.",00:17:41.300,00:17:43.380
This one is not surjective.,00:17:43.380,00:17:44.926
"Because this one is
not covered at all.",00:17:44.926,00:17:46.550
It's only mapped to once.,00:17:46.550,00:17:49.081
OK.,00:17:49.081,00:17:49.580
"So let us talk again
about permutations.",00:17:49.580,00:17:54.980
"So let me talk
about permutations.",00:17:54.980,00:17:57.230
"We can define a mapping
using a permutation that",00:17:57.230,00:18:01.040
is an example of a bijection.,00:18:01.040,00:18:03.640
So let's do that.,00:18:03.640,00:18:06.290
"And then we can come
to the mapping rule.",00:18:06.290,00:18:09.589
"And we can start to
do some counting.",00:18:09.589,00:18:11.130
"So for example if we have a
permutation, a 1 up to a n, so",00:18:14.240,00:18:24.900
"let this be a
permutation of the set",00:18:24.900,00:18:31.270
"S that contains all the
elements a 1, up to a n.",00:18:31.270,00:18:37.130
"So this is just one
example of a permutation.",00:18:37.130,00:18:39.930
"And now we may define
the following function.",00:18:39.930,00:18:42.860
"We say that pi evaluated
in a i give us output i.",00:18:42.860,00:18:52.630
"Actually, what I mean
here is that if you",00:18:52.630,00:18:56.080
"take an element in
S, then this one",00:18:56.080,00:19:00.340
"is mapped to under this
function to i if and only",00:19:00.340,00:19:07.610
"if a is in the i-th position
in this permutation.",00:19:07.610,00:19:12.000
"So if and only if today is in
i-th term in the permutation.",00:19:12.000,00:19:24.450
"So in this case, we know
that pi is bijective.",00:19:30.530,00:19:35.600
And why is this?,00:19:35.600,00:19:36.930
"Well, we know from the
definition of a permutation",00:19:36.930,00:19:42.300
"that any permutation is a
sequence in which every element",00:19:42.300,00:19:45.650
of S occurs exactly once.,00:19:45.650,00:19:48.430
"So that means that every
position is covered exactly",00:19:48.430,00:19:53.540
"once by an element of
S. And that is exactly",00:19:53.540,00:19:56.790
"the definition over
here which says",00:19:56.790,00:19:59.190
"that every element in the
range is mapped to exactly",00:19:59.190,00:20:05.190
once by an element in a domain.,00:20:05.190,00:20:07.960
"So this is an example
of a bijection.",00:20:07.960,00:20:10.195
OK.,00:20:13.340,00:20:13.840
"So now that we have
defined functions",00:20:13.840,00:20:16.570
"and the special
properties, let's",00:20:16.570,00:20:18.540
"talk about the mapping rule,
which we'll do over here.",00:20:18.540,00:20:24.830
"And now for the
first time we start",00:20:28.600,00:20:33.340
"to talk about the
cardinalities of sets",00:20:33.340,00:20:36.055
"and how they're
related to one another.",00:20:36.055,00:20:37.680
"So the mapping
rule is that first",00:20:40.440,00:20:43.610
"of all, if f is a
function from x to y",00:20:43.610,00:20:48.610
"and if f is actually surjective,
well, what do we know?",00:20:48.610,00:20:53.900
"We actually know
that the cardinality",00:20:53.900,00:20:56.360
"of the number of
elements in the domain",00:20:56.360,00:20:59.140
"is at least the number
of elements in the range.",00:20:59.140,00:21:02.114
And why is that?,00:21:02.114,00:21:02.780
"If you look at a
definition of surjectivity,",00:21:02.780,00:21:05.950
"we know that every
element of y is",00:21:05.950,00:21:08.810
"covered by some element
in x at least once.",00:21:08.810,00:21:11.820
"And all the elements in x
and mapped to exactly one",00:21:11.820,00:21:19.350
element in y.,00:21:19.350,00:21:20.630
"So we know that the
cardinality of x is at least y.",00:21:20.630,00:21:24.780
"Because every element
in y is mapped",00:21:24.780,00:21:26.680
"by some unique
distinct element in x.",00:21:26.680,00:21:30.810
"And if a function f is
injective, well, in that case",00:21:30.810,00:21:38.910
"we know that the
reverse relation holds,",00:21:38.910,00:21:43.990
so inequality holds.,00:21:43.990,00:21:46.940
"The cardinality of x is at
most the cardinality of y.",00:21:46.940,00:21:51.660
So why is that?,00:21:51.660,00:21:52.470
"Well, every element in an
injective function, right?",00:21:52.470,00:21:56.800
"Every element is mapped
to at most one element.",00:21:56.800,00:22:00.045
"So every element in y is mapped
by at most one element in x.",00:22:03.700,00:22:08.430
"So we know that all
the elements in x",00:22:08.430,00:22:11.047
are mapped to some element in y.,00:22:11.047,00:22:14.540
"But every element in y cannot
map to by more than two times",00:22:14.540,00:22:20.320
by something in the domain.,00:22:20.320,00:22:21.970
"So we know that this
inequality holds.",00:22:21.970,00:22:25.380
OK.,00:22:25.380,00:22:25.880
"For a bijective function, we
have that both these properties",00:22:25.880,00:22:30.001
hold.,00:22:30.001,00:22:30.500
"And we will have an
equality over here.",00:22:30.500,00:22:34.570
"So if this one is bijective,
we have that the cardinalities",00:22:34.570,00:22:44.070
are equal to one another.,00:22:44.070,00:22:45.730
"And this is also called
the bijection rule.",00:22:45.730,00:22:48.630
"So let's give an
example where we",00:22:53.640,00:22:56.340
"want to find out how many
ways there are to select",00:22:56.340,00:23:03.790
12 doughnuts from 5 varieties.,00:23:03.790,00:23:07.110
"So let's see how
that would work.",00:23:07.110,00:23:08.817
"And the whole idea
is that we're going",00:23:08.817,00:23:10.400
"to define the set that
we want to count, which",00:23:10.400,00:23:14.320
"is all these possible
configurations of doughnuts",00:23:14.320,00:23:17.480
over five varieties of flavors.,00:23:17.480,00:23:19.455
"And then we're going to map
these to another structure",00:23:23.760,00:23:27.390
"that we can understand
a little be better.",00:23:27.390,00:23:29.870
So let's do this.,00:23:29.870,00:23:30.830
"So as an example, let x be all
the ways to select, say, 12",00:23:34.280,00:23:49.660
doughnuts from 5 varieties.,00:23:49.660,00:23:55.719
So let's give an example.,00:23:55.719,00:23:56.760
"For example, we may
have 2 doughnuts.",00:24:00.780,00:24:04.000
"And they are in the
chocolate flavored basket.",00:24:04.000,00:24:08.195
So we have chocolate.,00:24:08.195,00:24:09.070
"And suppose we have no doughnuts
in the lemon filled version",00:24:13.060,00:24:19.537
of a doughnut.,00:24:19.537,00:24:20.120
"Suppose he have a whole
bunch of doughnuts,",00:24:23.140,00:24:27.000
"say 6 of those,
that are with sugar.",00:24:27.000,00:24:32.590
"We have some that
are glazed, say 2.",00:24:32.590,00:24:34.680
"And finally, we have just a
couple of plain doughnuts.",00:24:38.050,00:24:44.120
"So this would be a
configuration that is in x.",00:24:44.120,00:24:47.190
"Because we have 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, varieties.",00:24:47.190,00:24:50.490
"And we have 12 doughnuts, 2 over
here, 6 here, 2, and another 2,",00:24:50.490,00:24:57.100
"12 doughnuts, that are selected
from these 5 varieties.",00:24:57.100,00:25:02.180
"Now, if you are going to try to
represent such a configuration,",00:25:02.180,00:25:08.320
"that's usually how we
think about counting,",00:25:08.320,00:25:11.110
"then we may map this
to a 01 sequence.",00:25:11.110,00:25:14.460
So how do we do this?,00:25:14.460,00:25:16.040
"We can just map the
doughnuts two 0s, the divider",00:25:16.040,00:25:19.700
between the two baskets as a 1.,00:25:19.700,00:25:23.240
So this is a 1.,00:25:23.240,00:25:24.160
"Then we have no 0
between these two ones,",00:25:24.160,00:25:29.030
"because there are no doughnuts
in the lemon filled basket.",00:25:29.030,00:25:31.540
"So we have one that is the
mapping from this divider",00:25:31.540,00:25:36.510
field over here.,00:25:36.510,00:25:38.260
We've got 6 0s.,00:25:38.260,00:25:39.250
"We have another one that
is this divider, two 0s,",00:25:41.872,00:25:45.630
"two doughnuts in the
glazed version, and so on.",00:25:45.630,00:25:50.250
So what do we see here?,00:25:50.250,00:25:51.800
"We have a 01 sequence where we
have 12 zeros and we have 1, 2,",00:25:51.800,00:25:59.790
"3, 4 1s.",00:25:59.790,00:26:03.950
"And we can see that this
mapping is actually bijective.",00:26:03.950,00:26:07.190
"Because if I have two 0s, I
can map them back to doughnuts.",00:26:07.190,00:26:13.320
"The 1 I can map back to the
divider between two baskets.",00:26:13.320,00:26:17.710
"So let y be the set of all
kinds of configurations of 12,",00:26:17.710,00:26:27.390
all kinds of sequences.,00:26:27.390,00:26:29.100
"Oops, maybe I will
not take this one out.",00:26:29.100,00:26:32.815
Let's do this one.,00:26:32.815,00:26:34.030
"So if you are going
to define y as the set",00:26:36.840,00:26:47.530
"of all 16-bit sequences
with exactly four 1s,",00:26:47.530,00:27:02.280
"then we know that by
the bijection rule,",00:27:02.280,00:27:05.200
"we have created this
bijection over here,",00:27:05.200,00:27:08.280
"that the cardinalities of
x and y are exactly equal.",00:27:08.280,00:27:12.220
"So now we know that
by the bijection rule,",00:27:12.220,00:27:15.530
"we have been able to count
the number of elements",00:27:15.530,00:27:19.050
"in x by counting something else,
which is really how we proceed",00:27:19.050,00:27:22.600
in these types of proofs.,00:27:22.600,00:27:24.390
"So we are now able to just
count these types of objects.",00:27:24.390,00:27:30.150
"And later on next lecture,
we'll actually figure out",00:27:30.150,00:27:33.740
a formula for this one.,00:27:33.740,00:27:37.110
"So this is an example of how
we can use the bijection rule.",00:27:37.110,00:27:39.710
"Another example is one in which
we are going to count subsets.",00:27:42.460,00:27:47.220
"So we'll give a lot of examples
through these two lectures.",00:27:52.510,00:27:56.140
"And also the problem
set, as you will see,",00:27:56.140,00:27:58.040
"will have a lot of small
little parts with all kinds",00:27:58.040,00:28:02.860
"of countings that you will need
to do applying different rules.",00:28:02.860,00:28:05.740
"So let's talk about how to
count subsets of a set x.",00:28:08.680,00:28:15.860
"So what we want is a
bijection from subsets",00:28:15.860,00:28:25.630
"of a set x containing
of, say, 1 up",00:28:25.630,00:28:29.130
"to n, so the integers 1 up
to n, to n-bit sequences.",00:28:29.130,00:28:37.130
"We know that we
can do this if you",00:28:37.130,00:28:39.640
define a bijection as follows.,00:28:39.640,00:28:41.050
"So we map a subset
S under a mapping",00:28:43.800,00:28:50.880
"f to a bit sequence, b1,
b1, all the way to bn.",00:28:50.880,00:28:58.960
"If I add the
following relation, bi",00:28:58.960,00:29:02.880
"is computed as either a 1
or a 0, it's computed as a 1",00:29:02.880,00:29:07.770
"if i is in S. And it's
a 0 if i is not in S.",00:29:07.770,00:29:16.320
"Now, we know that
this is a bijection.",00:29:16.320,00:29:18.680
"So if we have a bit
sequence, then we",00:29:18.680,00:29:21.330
"can construct from this mapping
the corresponding subset.",00:29:21.330,00:29:25.880
"If you have a subset,
we can use this mapping",00:29:25.880,00:29:28.620
"to construct the
corresponding bit sequence.",00:29:28.620,00:29:32.040
"So how many n-bit
sequences are there?",00:29:38.840,00:29:43.890
"Well, there are 2 to the
power n n-bit sequences.",00:29:48.190,00:29:52.790
Why is that?,00:29:52.790,00:29:53.570
"Well, we have two choices
for b1, a 0 or a 1,",00:29:53.570,00:29:57.100
"two choices for b2,
0 or a 1, and so on.",00:29:57.100,00:30:00.300
"So we have 2 times 2
times 2 choices over here.",00:30:00.300,00:30:07.050
"So we have 2 to the power n
choices for a bit sequence.",00:30:07.050,00:30:12.710
"So there are 2 to the power
of n number of bit sequences.",00:30:12.710,00:30:16.150
And this is actually equal.,00:30:16.150,00:30:18.370
"Because of this bijection rule
that we have described over",00:30:18.370,00:30:21.640
"here, this is equal to the
total number of possible ways",00:30:21.640,00:30:26.160
to select subsets of x.,00:30:26.160,00:30:28.360
"So this is the number of
subsets of an n element set.",00:30:28.360,00:30:42.790
"So this is a very nice
way to demonstrate",00:30:42.790,00:30:47.790
"how we can use a bijection
rule to count something",00:30:47.790,00:30:50.880
"that appears to be
much more harder",00:30:50.880,00:30:52.800
"to think about, to grasp.",00:30:52.800,00:30:54.779
"At least for me it's
harder to grasp.",00:30:54.779,00:30:56.320
"So I have a subset
that can be any size",00:30:56.320,00:31:00.100
in a set of n elements.,00:31:00.100,00:31:02.750
"And now I can find
this really easy",00:31:02.750,00:31:04.960
"going mapping that I
can show to be bijective",00:31:04.960,00:31:07.140
"and all of a sudden, I
know how to count it.",00:31:07.140,00:31:09.930
"Because I can just
look at the image",00:31:09.930,00:31:13.430
"and count those types of
objects, in this case n-bit",00:31:13.430,00:31:16.930
sequences.,00:31:16.930,00:31:17.820
"I get a really
easygoing number that I",00:31:17.820,00:31:19.780
can compute fairly easily.,00:31:19.780,00:31:21.730
"And now I have counted
something much more complex.",00:31:21.730,00:31:25.800
"So this is how we generally
will think about these things.",00:31:25.800,00:31:30.340
OK.,00:31:30.340,00:31:30.840
"So let's talk now about
the generalized pigeon hole",00:31:30.840,00:31:35.910
principal.,00:31:35.910,00:31:36.410
"So we have covered quite a
lot of definitions right now.",00:31:36.410,00:31:42.100
"So we explained the
functions mapping rule.",00:31:42.100,00:31:44.820
"So now we come to generalized
pigeon hole principle",00:31:44.820,00:31:47.750
and a few other rules.,00:31:47.750,00:31:50.775
OK.,00:31:50.775,00:31:51.275
"So what about a generalized
pigeon hole principal?",00:32:04.597,00:32:06.680
"This is actually the
following counting argument.",00:32:17.940,00:32:24.210
"If I know that the
cardinality of a set x",00:32:24.210,00:32:29.160
"is more than k times the
cardinality of a set y,",00:32:29.160,00:32:34.550
what do I know?,00:32:34.550,00:32:35.670
"Well, I know that
for all functions f",00:32:35.670,00:32:38.990
"that have domain
x and range y, I",00:32:38.990,00:32:43.880
"know that there must exist k
plus 1 different elements of x",00:32:43.880,00:33:01.610
"that are mapped to
the same element in y.",00:33:01.610,00:33:05.440
"And if we take a
specific case k=1,",00:33:15.850,00:33:21.642
"we will actually call this
the pigeon hole principle.",00:33:21.642,00:33:23.850
"And let me just demonstrate
it by the famous example",00:33:27.930,00:33:31.970
of pigeons.,00:33:31.970,00:33:32.535
"Well, if I have more pigeons
that the number of holes",00:33:35.270,00:33:39.620
"than they can fly into, I know
for sure there exists a hole",00:33:39.620,00:33:45.120
that two pigeons will fit in.,00:33:45.120,00:33:48.510
"So that's where the
name comes from.",00:33:48.510,00:33:53.050
So let me write it out.,00:33:53.050,00:33:55.290
"So an example is if I
have more than n pigeons,",00:33:55.290,00:34:04.230
"so the pigeons from the set x,
and say they fly into n holes,",00:34:04.230,00:34:14.159
"and the holes is my
set y, well, then",00:34:14.159,00:34:17.929
"I know the cardinality of x is
more than the cardinality of y.",00:34:17.929,00:34:21.520
"I have more pigeons
than there are holes.",00:34:21.520,00:34:24.460
"So I know that at
least two pigeons",00:34:24.460,00:34:33.139
will fly into the same hole.,00:34:33.139,00:34:34.870
"So for a generalized
case, how can we",00:34:41.239,00:34:43.969
prove something like that?,00:34:43.969,00:34:45.730
"Well, we could use, for example,
something like a contradiction.",00:34:45.730,00:34:49.350
"For example, suppose
that for all k plus 1--",00:34:49.350,00:35:00.250
"as opposed to the
negation is true.",00:35:00.250,00:35:03.120
So how do we prove this usually?,00:35:03.120,00:35:04.660
So assume we have this.,00:35:04.660,00:35:06.350
We want to prove this.,00:35:06.350,00:35:07.430
"Well, suppose that's not true.",00:35:07.430,00:35:08.680
So suppose there's a mapping f.,00:35:08.680,00:35:10.900
"So a set for all k plus 1
different elements of x,",00:35:10.900,00:35:14.400
"well, they are not mapped
to the same elements in y.",00:35:14.400,00:35:18.880
"But what I really know then
is that every element in y",00:35:18.880,00:35:22.710
"is mapped to at most by
k distinct elements of x.",00:35:22.710,00:35:27.810
"So that means that the total
number of elements of x",00:35:27.810,00:35:33.170
must be at most k times y.,00:35:33.170,00:35:35.320
And that's not true.,00:35:35.320,00:35:36.240
It's larger by assumption.,00:35:36.240,00:35:38.050
So it's a contradiction.,00:35:38.050,00:35:39.690
"So this is a very
general principle though.",00:35:39.690,00:35:42.570
"And it's worth
writing it all out.",00:35:42.570,00:35:44.370
"Because this is a famous rule
that we will use in counting.",00:35:44.370,00:35:50.350
"And it leads to
interestingly results.",00:35:50.350,00:35:53.661
OK.,00:35:53.661,00:35:54.160
So let's give another example.,00:35:54.160,00:35:58.840
Let's think about Boston.,00:35:58.840,00:36:00.700
"In Boston, we have say a half
a million non-bald people.",00:36:00.700,00:36:05.350
"It turns out that there
are at least 3 people that",00:36:05.350,00:36:12.450
"have the exact same number
or hairs on the head.",00:36:12.450,00:36:15.485
So that's kind of weird.,00:36:15.485,00:36:16.560
How do we know that?,00:36:16.560,00:36:17.960
"I cannot point out any three
in Boston that have the same",00:36:17.960,00:36:22.180
number of hairs.,00:36:22.180,00:36:23.520
I have no idea.,00:36:23.520,00:36:24.690
"But somehow I can count
and use this principle",00:36:24.690,00:36:27.730
"and tell you that
it must be true",00:36:27.730,00:36:30.060
"that in Boston with
500,000 people,",00:36:30.060,00:36:34.110
"there are 3 of them
that are not bald.",00:36:34.110,00:36:36.990
So we exclude the bald people.,00:36:36.990,00:36:38.370
Because that would be easy.,00:36:38.370,00:36:39.494
They all have 0 hairs.,00:36:39.494,00:36:40.470
"But say non-bald
people that actually",00:36:40.470,00:36:44.970
have the same number of hairs.,00:36:44.970,00:36:46.520
So how do we do that?,00:36:46.520,00:36:49.170
"How can we make such
types of conclusions?",00:36:49.170,00:36:52.180
"So say Boston has about
500,000 and non-bald people.",00:36:52.180,00:37:01.860
And let's call this set x.,00:37:01.860,00:37:06.050
"Because we're going to use
the pigeon hole principle.",00:37:06.050,00:37:09.550
"So our claim is that there
exists 3 people in Boston such",00:37:09.550,00:37:21.210
"that they have the same
number of hairs on their head.",00:37:21.210,00:37:30.420
So how do we do this?,00:37:36.030,00:37:39.630
"Well, we know that
we may generally",00:37:39.630,00:37:44.830
"assume that any
person has at most",00:37:44.830,00:37:47.160
"200,000 hairs on their head.",00:37:47.160,00:37:50.750
"So the number of hairs on
a head is at most 200,000.",00:37:50.750,00:38:06.630
"So how should I define
my set y in order",00:38:06.630,00:38:09.780
"to apply this pigeon
hole principle?",00:38:09.780,00:38:12.080
So what do we do?,00:38:12.080,00:38:15.210
"So I want to have
mapping, right,",00:38:15.210,00:38:18.670
"from all the people the set
x to the number of hairs.",00:38:18.670,00:38:29.030
"So the number of hairs on one's
head is going to be the set y.",00:38:29.030,00:38:36.440
And what do we know?,00:38:36.440,00:38:38.950
"We know that the cardinality
of y is at most 200,000.",00:38:38.950,00:38:43.270
"Actually, the way we defined
it it's exactly 200,000.",00:38:43.270,00:38:48.350
"And the set x has a
cardinality of about 500,000.",00:38:48.350,00:38:54.950
So what do we know?,00:38:54.950,00:38:57.190
"We can apply our generalized
pigeon hole principle.",00:38:57.190,00:39:00.060
"It's very surprising, because we
notice that x is more than two",00:39:00.060,00:39:05.880
times the cardinality of y.,00:39:05.880,00:39:09.530
"2 times 200,000 is
less than 500,000.",00:39:09.530,00:39:13.080
"So I know that by this
particular principle,",00:39:13.080,00:39:18.470
"this particular mapping must
have the property, because this",00:39:18.470,00:39:21.790
"holds for all mappings, that
there are at least k plus 1, 2",00:39:21.790,00:39:26.020
"plus 1, 3 different people
in Boston out of the set",00:39:26.020,00:39:32.450
"x that are mapped to
the same element in y.",00:39:32.450,00:39:36.262
"That means that they
have the same number",00:39:36.262,00:39:37.970
of hairs on their head.,00:39:37.970,00:39:39.669
"So this is kind of
really surprising.",00:39:39.669,00:39:41.210
"We can make a statement
without really inspecting",00:39:41.210,00:39:45.080
every single person's head.,00:39:45.080,00:39:47.490
"But we can still make a
statement about the fact",00:39:47.490,00:39:52.170
"that there are 3 different
people in Boston that have",00:39:52.170,00:39:54.812
the exact same number of hairs.,00:39:54.812,00:39:58.020
"So this is an example of
a non-constructive proof.",00:39:58.020,00:40:01.770
And I will give another one.,00:40:01.770,00:40:03.450
"And it's a very
important principle.",00:40:03.450,00:40:07.250
"There's actually a new technique
that you haven't seen before.",00:40:07.250,00:40:10.400
"So far we have been
constructively proofing",00:40:10.400,00:40:14.340
"all kinds of properties
using induction mainly.",00:40:14.340,00:40:16.860
"And this is what is called
a non-constructive proof.",00:40:20.120,00:40:22.460
"Because I cannot give a specific
example that demonstrates that",00:40:22.460,00:40:26.790
this claim is true.,00:40:26.790,00:40:29.230
"But yet, I've shown
that it is true,",00:40:29.230,00:40:31.860
"but in a non-constructive
way without an example.",00:40:31.860,00:40:36.210
OK.,00:40:36.210,00:40:36.710
So what about another one?,00:40:36.710,00:40:39.510
"For example, we may pick 10
arbitrary two-digit numbers.",00:40:44.590,00:40:50.200
"So pick 10 arbitrary
double-digit numbers.",00:40:50.200,00:40:58.695
"And we can pick any
sequence of numbers.",00:41:02.750,00:41:07.805
I'm just picking a few.,00:41:07.805,00:41:09.740
"You may add a few, too.",00:41:09.740,00:41:11.840
"i don't know, 2, 7, 14, I don't
know, 31, 25, 60, 92, and so",00:41:11.840,00:41:23.470
on.,00:41:23.470,00:41:24.230
"So I have 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,",00:41:24.230,00:41:30.510
"I don't know 9, and another one,
say, 91 or something like that.",00:41:30.510,00:41:37.720
"And so I have 10
double-digit numbers.",00:41:37.720,00:41:41.450
"It turns out that I can
show to you that there",00:41:41.450,00:41:43.920
"are two subsets that if I look
at the sum of their elements,",00:41:43.920,00:41:50.560
"so I look at sum of the
elements of the first subset",00:41:50.560,00:41:53.550
"and I look at the sum of the
elements of the second subset,",00:41:53.550,00:41:57.810
"that I can find two subsets
that have an equal sum.",00:41:57.810,00:42:02.080
"Now if you just look
at those numbers,",00:42:02.080,00:42:03.930
"and I've now picked 10
arbitrary double-digit numbers,",00:42:03.930,00:42:07.642
"well, usually it's pretty hard
to figure out whether that's",00:42:07.642,00:42:10.100
really true or not.,00:42:10.100,00:42:11.040
"Maybe I have been selecting
the numbers in such a way",00:42:11.040,00:42:13.970
that it's easy to see.,00:42:13.970,00:42:16.460
"I mean, we can still try
to wrap our minds around it",00:42:16.460,00:42:19.480
"and try to really solve
this constructively",00:42:19.480,00:42:21.810
by giving an example.,00:42:21.810,00:42:23.880
"It turns out that we can
prove this statement.",00:42:23.880,00:42:26.380
"And we will use the
pigeon hole principle.",00:42:26.380,00:42:29.880
"And we do not even have
to actually-- oh, you",00:42:29.880,00:42:32.550
have a question?,00:42:32.550,00:42:33.731
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:42:33.731,00:42:36.320
"PROFESSOR: Oh, sure.",00:42:36.320,00:42:37.170
We can make it double-digits.,00:42:37.170,00:42:39.110
So I could put this here.,00:42:39.110,00:42:40.900
"It'll be 4, 2 of I want to.",00:42:40.900,00:42:44.020
"But yeah, just select
something else.",00:42:44.020,00:42:46.469
It doesn't really matter.,00:42:46.469,00:42:47.510
Yeah.,00:42:51.931,00:42:52.430
"So what we are going to show now
is that through the pigeon hole",00:42:52.430,00:42:55.160
"principle, we can prove that
there are two subsets that",00:42:55.160,00:42:59.240
have the same sum.,00:42:59.240,00:43:00.830
"And just by inspection it's
a very hard problem to solve.",00:43:00.830,00:43:05.420
"So I did not even
give you an example.",00:43:05.420,00:43:08.380
But we can still show this.,00:43:08.380,00:43:10.600
"So how can we go
ahead with this?",00:43:10.600,00:43:12.970
"So let's think together
about this problem.",00:43:12.970,00:43:16.740
"So I want to choose
two sets x and y.",00:43:16.740,00:43:22.060
"And somehow, I want to
have a mapping, right,",00:43:22.060,00:43:26.580
"from any double-digit
set of numbers.",00:43:26.580,00:43:34.840
"Somehow I want to
map that to sums.",00:43:34.840,00:43:38.020
"Because that's what
I'm interested in.",00:43:38.020,00:43:39.680
I'm interested in sums.,00:43:39.680,00:43:40.820
"And I want to show
something about subsets",00:43:40.820,00:43:50.990
of these double-digit numbers.,00:43:50.990,00:43:52.770
So what do I do?,00:43:52.770,00:43:54.790
"I take x as the collection
of subsets of these numbers.",00:43:54.790,00:44:06.830
"And I want to that there are
at least two subsets that",00:44:10.370,00:44:14.040
map to the same sum.,00:44:14.040,00:44:15.880
"So let's first count
how many we have here.",00:44:15.880,00:44:18.890
We already did this.,00:44:18.890,00:44:19.790
"We made a mapping from subsets
to two binary sequences,",00:44:19.790,00:44:26.240
bit sequences.,00:44:26.240,00:44:27.660
"In this case, we
have 10 numbers.",00:44:27.660,00:44:31.160
"So we have 2 to the power
10 possible subsets.",00:44:31.160,00:44:37.660
"So this is equal to 1,024.",00:44:37.660,00:44:41.870
"Now y is going to be
the sum of a subset.",00:44:41.870,00:44:46.890
So what do I know?,00:44:46.890,00:44:51.520
"I know that the
possible sums range",00:44:51.520,00:44:55.570
"from 0 all the way to,
well, what's the maximum?",00:44:55.570,00:45:00.300
"sum that I can have
out of a subset of 10",00:45:00.300,00:45:05.990
double-digit numbers?,00:45:05.990,00:45:07.000
"So I can select all the
10 elements in this set.",00:45:07.000,00:45:13.110
And they are double digit.,00:45:13.110,00:45:14.320
"So at most, they are 99.",00:45:14.320,00:45:18.410
"So I know that
this set is really",00:45:18.410,00:45:23.650
the set of all possible sums.,00:45:23.650,00:45:28.070
"Now we know that 1,024
is more than 990.",00:45:31.630,00:45:36.250
"So the cardinality of x is
more than the cardinality of y.",00:45:36.250,00:45:40.980
"So by the pigeon
hole principle, we",00:45:40.980,00:45:42.460
"know that there exists at least
two different elements of x.",00:45:42.460,00:45:46.960
"In our case, there exists
two different subsets",00:45:46.960,00:45:50.710
"that map to the same
elements in y, the same sum.",00:45:50.710,00:45:56.600
"So now we have shown that
even though we have not",00:45:56.600,00:46:03.050
"shown any particular
example that demonstrates",00:46:03.050,00:46:05.760
"this claim that there are
two different subsets that",00:46:05.760,00:46:08.620
"have the same sum, we
still got a proof using",00:46:08.620,00:46:12.010
counting that this is true.,00:46:12.010,00:46:14.460
"So this is called a
non-constructive proof.",00:46:14.460,00:46:17.500
Let me write it down.,00:46:17.500,00:46:18.545
"And this is a great way
of proofing properties.",00:46:25.980,00:46:32.540
"So now we can continue
with another definition",00:46:36.720,00:46:45.280
"where we look at
another property.",00:46:45.280,00:46:48.610
"Over here, we talks about
surjectivity, injectivity,",00:46:48.610,00:46:51.490
and bijectivity.,00:46:51.490,00:46:54.670
"And now we will talk about
the following property.",00:46:54.670,00:47:02.630
"We say that a k
to 1 function is f",00:47:02.630,00:47:15.560
"from x to y actually maps
actually k elements of x",00:47:15.560,00:47:33.795
to every element of y.,00:47:33.795,00:47:42.190
So what do we know?,00:47:42.190,00:47:45.890
"Well, we can have the
following counting rule",00:47:45.890,00:47:49.770
that we call the division rule.,00:47:49.770,00:47:52.200
"And it says that if f
such a type of function,",00:47:52.200,00:47:57.020
"so if f is k to 1,
well then we know",00:47:57.020,00:48:05.940
"that the cardinality
of the domain",00:48:05.940,00:48:09.340
"is equal to k times
the cardinality y.",00:48:09.340,00:48:16.170
And why is that?,00:48:16.170,00:48:16.920
"Well, exactly k elements of
x map to each element of y.",00:48:16.920,00:48:21.160
"So the first element
of y, we have",00:48:21.160,00:48:23.240
k elements of x mapped to it.,00:48:23.240,00:48:25.460
"The second element of y, k
elements mapped to that one.",00:48:25.460,00:48:28.680
"So we know that the
domain is exactly",00:48:28.680,00:48:31.030
"k times the range, k times
the size of the range.",00:48:31.030,00:48:35.930
"Now this division rule
actually generalizes",00:48:35.930,00:48:41.830
"the bijection rule,
which I've put",00:48:41.830,00:48:46.020
"over there, the bijection rule.",00:48:46.020,00:48:48.010
And why is that?,00:48:50.570,00:48:53.030
"Well, that's because a function
is a bijection if and only",00:48:53.030,00:48:59.520
if it is actually 1 to 1.,00:48:59.520,00:49:05.720
"So if you replace k by 1, we
have that exactly one element",00:49:05.720,00:49:11.340
"of x is mapped to
every element in y.",00:49:11.340,00:49:13.510
"And that's the definition
of a bijection.",00:49:13.510,00:49:17.080
"And the bijection rule says
that if you have a bijection,",00:49:17.080,00:49:20.180
"then the cardinality
of the domain",00:49:20.180,00:49:23.000
"is equal to the cardinality
of the range, so for k",00:49:23.000,00:49:26.140
equals 1 here.,00:49:26.140,00:49:29.350
"So let's give an example
on how this works.",00:49:29.350,00:49:33.890
"I think we can take
this out actually.",00:49:33.890,00:49:38.993
"So let's give an example
using a chessboard,",00:49:42.240,00:49:46.430
"where we have 2 identical rooks
and we want to count the number",00:49:46.430,00:49:51.860
"of ways we can put them on the
chessboard in such a way that",00:49:51.860,00:49:57.060
"the 2 rooks cannot
see one another,",00:49:57.060,00:50:01.640
"meaning that the rooks are on
different rows and on different",00:50:01.640,00:50:06.040
columns.,00:50:06.040,00:50:08.140
So let's give an example.,00:50:08.140,00:50:10.500
So the example is like this.,00:50:10.500,00:50:11.700
"So how many ways do we have
to place 2 identical rooks",00:50:11.700,00:50:32.160
"on a chessboard in such a
way that no row or column",00:50:32.160,00:50:45.735
is shared?,00:50:45.735,00:50:46.235
So how can we do this?,00:50:50.820,00:50:54.270
"Well, for example, let's
look at a chessboard.",00:50:54.270,00:50:59.750
"And suppose we have a rook
over here and a rook over here.",00:51:04.190,00:51:09.980
"And say the first rook is
on row 1 and on column 1.",00:51:09.980,00:51:18.250
"And the second rook is
on row 2, R2, on row R2,",00:51:18.250,00:51:25.050
"and on the column
that is indexed by C2.",00:51:25.050,00:51:31.280
"So how can we describe
such configurations?",00:51:31.280,00:51:35.270
"Well, I could describe this
by using a sequence in which I",00:51:35.270,00:51:40.230
"look at the placement
of the first rook,",00:51:40.230,00:51:42.230
"and then describe the
placement of the second rook.",00:51:42.230,00:51:44.570
"So I may have r1, c1,
and then r2 and c2.",00:51:44.570,00:51:51.400
"So this could be
a way to describe",00:51:51.400,00:51:54.680
the positioning of these rooks.,00:51:54.680,00:51:57.830
"And I could create a mapping
f that is doing this for me.",00:51:57.830,00:52:03.470
"And so if I call this
an example of a valid.",00:52:03.470,00:52:11.210
"So let y be the set of
valid rook configuration.",00:52:14.020,00:52:17.200
And this is one example of it.,00:52:17.200,00:52:18.640
So this is part of this set.,00:52:18.640,00:52:20.646
"And if I define x
as all the sequences",00:52:30.380,00:52:44.510
"r1, c1, r2, and c2 such that,
well, the rook over here",00:52:44.510,00:52:53.160
"does not share a row
with the rook that",00:52:53.160,00:52:55.670
is described by this position.,00:52:55.670,00:52:57.280
So r1 is not equal to r2.,00:52:57.280,00:53:00.800
"And they also do
not share a column.",00:53:00.800,00:53:02.710
So the first rook has column c1.,00:53:02.710,00:53:07.790
The second one is on column c2.,00:53:07.790,00:53:10.860
"So also c1 and c2
should be different.",00:53:10.860,00:53:13.555
"So these sequences are
really placements, right?",00:53:16.080,00:53:19.080
So this describes rook 1.,00:53:19.080,00:53:23.040
This describes the rook 2.,00:53:23.040,00:53:26.680
"And the whole combination
is really a placement.",00:53:26.680,00:53:31.605
"So now I have
described the function",00:53:36.950,00:53:38.690
"f that maps a sequence
that describes",00:53:38.690,00:53:41.820
"the position of the first
and the second rook,",00:53:41.820,00:53:45.710
"maps such a sequence
to an element in y,",00:53:45.710,00:53:49.450
"which is a valid
rook configuration.",00:53:49.450,00:53:52.830
"So now let's have a look at how
we can apply the division rule.",00:53:52.830,00:53:56.470
So is this function bijective?,00:53:56.470,00:54:02.380
Is that true?,00:54:02.380,00:54:02.940
"So is it true that every--
so I have a mapping that",00:54:06.770,00:54:11.300
goes from here to here.,00:54:11.300,00:54:13.530
"But is it true that every
valid rook configuration",00:54:13.530,00:54:18.510
is mapped to exactly once?,00:54:18.510,00:54:22.120
Is that true?,00:54:22.120,00:54:23.870
"Is this the only sequence that
will map using this function f",00:54:23.870,00:54:33.960
into a valid configuration?,00:54:33.960,00:54:35.285
Yup.,00:54:38.170,00:54:38.670
It's true.,00:54:38.670,00:54:40.090
"So you can switch
rook 1 and rook 2.",00:54:40.090,00:54:45.140
And it will still look the same.,00:54:45.140,00:54:46.910
The 2 rooks are identical.,00:54:46.910,00:54:48.190
They look exactly the same.,00:54:48.190,00:54:49.450
"So we have, again, the
exact same configuration.",00:54:49.450,00:54:53.520
"And we can see that this
particular sequence also",00:54:53.520,00:55:02.150
maps to the same.,00:55:02.150,00:55:03.320
It just swap the positions.,00:55:03.320,00:55:06.840
"So we have r2, c2,
r1, and c1 also maps",00:55:06.840,00:55:11.550
"under f to the
same configuration.",00:55:11.550,00:55:14.770
"And those are the
exact 2 possibilities",00:55:14.770,00:55:18.960
"that can happen that map
to this configuration.",00:55:18.960,00:55:24.230
"Every valid configuration is
mapped to exactly 2 times.",00:55:24.230,00:55:28.290
"So now we can use
the division rule.",00:55:28.290,00:55:30.780
Because f is 2 to 1.,00:55:30.780,00:55:32.570
So f is 2 to 1.,00:55:32.570,00:55:39.240
"What does that mean if you
apply the division rule?",00:55:39.240,00:55:41.720
"It means that the cardinality
of all those sequences",00:55:41.720,00:55:47.220
"is equal to 2 times
the cardinality",00:55:47.220,00:55:49.500
of valid configurations.,00:55:49.500,00:55:52.420
"Or in other words,
the cardinality",00:55:52.420,00:55:56.480
"for all the valid configurations
is the cardinality",00:55:56.480,00:55:59.140
"of all those possible
sequences divided by 2.",00:55:59.140,00:56:03.840
"So now we can start
counting x over here.",00:56:03.840,00:56:07.720
So how do we do that?,00:56:07.720,00:56:08.881
"Well, I'm going to use something
similar as what we did when",00:56:08.881,00:56:11.380
we were counting permutations.,00:56:11.380,00:56:13.640
"And we'll generalize
it in a moment.",00:56:13.640,00:56:17.410
So how do we go about this?,00:56:17.410,00:56:18.880
"Well, let's have a look.",00:56:18.880,00:56:20.320
"If I have r1, c1, and r2, and
c2, so this is a sequence.",00:56:20.320,00:56:32.410
So how many choices do I have?,00:56:32.410,00:56:35.450
"Well, a chessboard has 8 rows.",00:56:35.450,00:56:38.130
"So I can choose 8 possible
rows for the first rook.",00:56:38.130,00:56:46.620
It also has 8 columns.,00:56:46.620,00:56:47.860
"So I have 8 possible
choices for the column.",00:56:47.860,00:56:52.190
But what about the second rook?,00:56:52.190,00:56:54.180
"Well, the second rook can
be on any row except the one",00:56:54.180,00:56:58.690
"that I've already
selected for the first.",00:56:58.690,00:57:01.590
"So this 8 minus 1, we have
7 possible choices to select",00:57:01.590,00:57:07.790
the row for the second rook.,00:57:07.790,00:57:09.530
"It must be different from the
one that was already selected.",00:57:09.530,00:57:12.600
And I have 7 possible choices.,00:57:12.600,00:57:14.620
"And similarly for
this particular column",00:57:14.620,00:57:17.650
"as well, the column
has to be different.",00:57:17.650,00:57:19.990
So how many choices do I have?,00:57:19.990,00:57:22.080
"Well, it's not 8.",00:57:22.080,00:57:23.310
"It's one less, because
I've already selected",00:57:23.310,00:57:25.440
the one for the first rook.,00:57:25.440,00:57:27.830
So I have 7 choices.,00:57:27.830,00:57:31.100
"So the cardinality of x is
actually equal to 8 times",00:57:31.100,00:57:36.200
8 times 7 times 7.,00:57:36.200,00:57:38.220
"So it's 8 times 7
squared divided by 2.",00:57:38.220,00:57:43.520
"So now we have to counted,
by using the division rule,",00:57:43.520,00:57:46.670
we have to the divide this by 2.,00:57:46.670,00:57:49.065
"We have counted the total
number of valid configurations.",00:57:49.065,00:57:51.440
"So now we are going to
generalize this principle",00:57:55.460,00:57:58.560
that we have talked about here.,00:57:58.560,00:58:00.580
"And we will do that
over here I think.",00:58:00.580,00:58:05.980
Yup.,00:58:05.980,00:58:07.870
"And that's the
generalized product rule.",00:58:07.870,00:58:11.494
"So the generalized product
rule is as follows.",00:58:15.210,00:58:21.460
"It's essentially
saying that if we",00:58:21.460,00:58:25.200
"have a set of sequences
of length k, then",00:58:25.200,00:58:30.950
how can we count those?,00:58:30.950,00:58:32.320
"Well, if we know the
following properties-- well,",00:58:32.320,00:58:36.055
"let me first write out
the generalized product",00:58:36.055,00:58:45.486
rule is as follows.,00:58:45.486,00:58:53.050
"Let S be a set of
length k sequences.",00:58:53.050,00:59:03.380
"Then I know that if there
are n1 possible first entries",00:59:07.300,00:59:26.940
"and if I know that once I've
selected my first entry,",00:59:26.940,00:59:30.970
"there are n2 possible second
entries for each first entry.",00:59:30.970,00:59:43.567
"And if I continue
like this, my choice",00:59:55.020,00:59:57.640
"for the third term
in the sequence",00:59:57.640,01:00:00.710
"is I've always n3
possible choices",01:00:00.710,01:00:07.930
"given my selection for
the first 2 entries.",01:00:07.930,01:00:11.990
"So if I have that property
that continues in that way,",01:00:11.990,01:00:14.950
so let me write it out.,01:00:14.950,01:00:16.080
"So we have n3
possible third entries",01:00:16.080,01:00:26.458
"for each combination
in this case of first",01:00:26.458,01:00:39.210
together with second entries.,01:00:39.210,01:00:45.370
"And if I continue this
all the way to nk,",01:00:45.370,01:00:49.890
"so nk possible kth entries
for each combination of all",01:00:49.890,01:00:54.810
"the previous
entries, then I know",01:00:54.810,01:01:02.070
"that the set S
can be counted as,",01:01:02.070,01:01:06.430
"well, I've n1 possible
choices for the first entry.",01:01:06.430,01:01:09.560
"Once I've chosen
to fix that one,",01:01:09.560,01:01:11.350
"I have n2 possible choices
for the second, then",01:01:11.350,01:01:15.010
"n3 possible choice
for the third.",01:01:15.010,01:01:16.830
And I go all the way to nk.,01:01:16.830,01:01:21.520
"Well, let's first talk about
it from the perspective",01:01:21.520,01:01:23.780
of the chess problem here.,01:01:23.780,01:01:25.980
I got 8 possible choices for r1.,01:01:25.980,01:01:29.960
"Given r1, I don't care.",01:01:29.960,01:01:32.130
"I still have 8 possible
choices for the column here.",01:01:32.130,01:01:35.290
So I have 8 choices here.,01:01:35.290,01:01:37.270
"But for the third one, once
I have selected r1 and c1,",01:01:37.270,01:01:42.220
"I only have 7 choices left for
r2 and 7 choices left for c2.",01:01:42.220,01:01:48.160
"So that's an
example where we use",01:01:48.160,01:01:50.800
"this particular
generalized product rule.",01:01:50.800,01:01:54.160
"Also when we were counting
the number of permutations,",01:01:54.160,01:01:59.210
"we were saying we can
fix the first entry",01:01:59.210,01:02:02.390
"of a permutation
in n ways if I have",01:02:02.390,01:02:04.740
a permutation for n elements.,01:02:04.740,01:02:07.160
"And then I have the second
entry, the second term,",01:02:07.160,01:02:13.640
"of a permutation has
only n minus 1 choices.",01:02:13.640,01:02:16.410
Because I've already chosen one.,01:02:16.410,01:02:18.770
"And the next one has
n minus 3 choices.",01:02:18.770,01:02:20.850
"Because I've already
selected 2 of them.",01:02:20.850,01:02:23.020
"So I have only n
minus 2 choices left.",01:02:23.020,01:02:25.350
Then I have n minus 3 choices.,01:02:25.350,01:02:26.830
"Because I've already
selected 3 and so on.",01:02:26.830,01:02:29.430
And I get n factorial.,01:02:29.430,01:02:31.870
"So that's the same kind of
principle that we have here.",01:02:31.870,01:02:36.070
"So let me give an example where
we can see how this works.",01:02:36.070,01:02:42.170
So what do we do?,01:02:57.550,01:02:59.700
"In this example, we want to
count the number of committees.",01:02:59.700,01:03:03.920
"So it's the exact
same kind of principle",01:03:03.920,01:03:05.635
that we are going to talk about.,01:03:05.635,01:03:08.170
"So we are going to count the
number of communities described",01:03:08.170,01:03:13.390
"by sequence x, y, z, where
x the first one is, say,",01:03:13.390,01:03:18.370
the leader of the committee.,01:03:18.370,01:03:21.560
"The second one
indicates the secretary.",01:03:21.560,01:03:25.790
"The third one is
some consultant.",01:03:25.790,01:03:29.200
So they're all different.,01:03:29.200,01:03:30.880
They have all different roles.,01:03:30.880,01:03:33.070
"And such a committee is
elected from n members.",01:03:33.070,01:03:41.335
"And in how many
ways can I do this?",01:03:44.260,01:03:46.690
"Well, I have n ways to choose
my first term in the sequence.",01:03:46.690,01:03:53.290
"I have n ways to
choose the leader.",01:03:53.290,01:03:55.590
So there's n ways to choose x.,01:03:55.590,01:03:59.235
"How many ways do I
have to choose y?",01:04:03.090,01:04:04.680
"Well, if I've chosen
already a leader,",01:04:04.680,01:04:06.880
I need to choose someone else.,01:04:06.880,01:04:08.400
"So I have n minus 1 members
left, n minus 1 ways",01:04:08.400,01:04:13.140
to choose y.,01:04:13.140,01:04:14.485
"I'm just not
allowed to choose x.",01:04:17.760,01:04:20.550
"And then I will
have n minus 2 ways",01:04:23.690,01:04:27.000
to choose a z except x and y.,01:04:27.000,01:04:34.100
"And so for each x, I have only
n minus 1 ways to choose y.",01:04:34.100,01:04:39.270
"For each x and y, I have only
n minus 2 ways to choose z.",01:04:39.270,01:04:44.010
"So if I multiply
all this together,",01:04:44.010,01:04:46.640
"I get n times n minus
1 times n minus 2",01:04:46.640,01:04:51.190
"to choose all these
committee-- this",01:04:51.190,01:04:54.610
"is the total number
of possible committees",01:04:54.610,01:04:56.360
"that I can select from an
n member set of people.",01:04:56.360,01:05:01.960
"So let's go to a little bit
of a different example that",01:05:01.960,01:05:06.450
uses the same principle.,01:05:06.450,01:05:07.510
OK.,01:05:10.431,01:05:10.930
Let's make some space.,01:05:10.930,01:05:14.030
"In the second problem,
I will define to you",01:05:18.570,01:05:22.790
a defective dollar bill.,01:05:22.790,01:05:25.107
It's not really defective.,01:05:25.107,01:05:26.190
"But it's a property that we
will assign to dollar bill.",01:05:26.190,01:05:30.420
"And you can check for
yourself whether you",01:05:30.420,01:05:32.170
have one in your wallet.,01:05:32.170,01:05:34.410
"So let's define a
defective dollar bill",01:05:34.410,01:05:38.230
"to have the property
that if you look",01:05:38.230,01:05:41.860
"at the 8-bit serial
number, some of the digits",01:05:41.860,01:05:53.540
appear more than once.,01:05:53.540,01:05:55.590
"So some digit appears
more than once",01:05:55.590,01:06:11.560
in the 8-bit serial number.,01:06:11.560,01:06:14.702
"So you can check our own wallet
and check for your $1 bills",01:06:19.430,01:06:22.574
"and check whether you
have a defective dollar.",01:06:22.574,01:06:24.490
"This seems to be a pretty
specific and rare property,",01:06:24.490,01:06:27.480
right?,01:06:27.480,01:06:28.700
"Well, check you dollar bills.",01:06:28.700,01:06:33.560
"You'll figure out that you have
probably a defective dollar",01:06:33.560,01:06:36.297
bill in your wallet.,01:06:36.297,01:06:37.130
So that's kind of weird.,01:06:37.130,01:06:38.580
But it seems this property.,01:06:38.580,01:06:41.120
"If you look at
that, it seems to be",01:06:41.120,01:06:42.912
"something that is
maybe a little bit more",01:06:42.912,01:06:44.620
common than we thought it is.,01:06:44.620,01:06:46.580
It seems to be so special.,01:06:46.580,01:06:48.590
"So let's do a counting
argument and find out",01:06:48.590,01:06:50.850
what's happening here.,01:06:50.850,01:06:52.590
"So let's look at a fraction
of the non-defective.",01:06:52.590,01:06:59.510
"So we are counting the opposite,
the non-defective bills.",01:06:59.510,01:07:07.540
"Well, that's the number of
non-defective serial numbers",01:07:07.540,01:07:21.090
"divided by the total
number of serial numbers.",01:07:21.090,01:07:27.380
"And let's call these small
x and y and count these.",01:07:31.680,01:07:40.030
So let's see.,01:07:40.030,01:07:40.640
"So first of all, let's count y.",01:07:44.340,01:07:46.250
"Well, that's easy, I have 8
digits in my serial number.",01:07:46.250,01:07:49.480
"So I have 10 choices
for the first digit,",01:07:49.480,01:07:52.290
"10 choices for the
second one, and so on.",01:07:52.290,01:07:55.170
"In total, I have
10 times 10 times",01:07:55.170,01:07:56.970
10 to the power 8 choices.,01:07:56.970,01:07:59.580
What about x?,01:07:59.580,01:08:01.530
"Well, I'm using, again,
our generalized product",01:08:01.530,01:08:08.040
rule over here.,01:08:08.040,01:08:09.760
"Well, if I'm going to have
a non-defective dollar bill,",01:08:09.760,01:08:14.070
"then all the digits in
the 8 digit serial number",01:08:14.070,01:08:18.069
have to be different.,01:08:18.069,01:08:20.100
"So for the first digit,
I have 10 choices.",01:08:20.100,01:08:23.050
"Now that I've selected
my first digit,",01:08:23.050,01:08:25.649
"I have 9 digits for my second
choice for my second digit",01:08:25.649,01:08:32.290
in the serial number.,01:08:32.290,01:08:34.020
"Then I have 8
possible choices, 7,",01:08:34.020,01:08:36.430
because I've already selected 3.,01:08:36.430,01:08:37.950
"And I cannot choose
those anymore--",01:08:37.950,01:08:40.090
times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3.,01:08:40.090,01:08:43.760
"And now I have chosen an 8
digit serial number in which",01:08:43.760,01:08:48.330
all the digits are different.,01:08:48.330,01:08:51.760
OK So how many are these?,01:08:51.760,01:08:55.680
"Well, this is actually
equal to 10 factorial",01:08:55.680,01:08:58.500
divided by 2 factorial.,01:08:58.500,01:09:01.330
"And it turns out to be
something like 1,814,400.",01:09:01.330,01:09:08.100
possible choices.,01:09:08.100,01:09:10.140
"So now let's look
at the fraction.",01:09:10.140,01:09:12.359
"It turns out if you
divide this by this,",01:09:12.359,01:09:15.490
"you get a really
very small fraction.",01:09:15.490,01:09:18.640
"This is actually
equal to 1.8144%",01:09:18.640,01:09:25.800
"So a very small fraction
is non-defective.",01:09:25.800,01:09:29.620
"So almost all the dollars
are sort of defective.",01:09:29.620,01:09:32.370
"It simply means that they
have this special property",01:09:32.370,01:09:35.840
"that some digit
occurs more than once.",01:09:35.840,01:09:40.434
So it's kind of interesting.,01:09:40.434,01:09:41.600
"So we can already
see that by counting,",01:09:41.600,01:09:45.695
"it's sometimes a little
bit counterintuitive.",01:09:45.695,01:09:47.569
"Because if I would see
this particular property,",01:09:47.569,01:09:51.170
"I would in first
instance think that it's",01:09:51.170,01:09:53.080
a very special property.,01:09:53.080,01:09:54.520
But that's not true.,01:09:54.520,01:09:55.830
It's very common it turns out.,01:09:55.830,01:10:00.070
"Now a special case of the
generalized product rule",01:10:00.070,01:10:03.860
is the product rule.,01:10:03.860,01:10:06.120
And this is defined as follows.,01:10:06.120,01:10:10.600
"We are going to first of all
define a product over sets.",01:10:10.600,01:10:13.285
"The definition is
that the product",01:10:15.940,01:10:18.760
"of a set A1 with A2
up to An is actually",01:10:18.760,01:10:26.120
equal to the set of sequences.,01:10:26.120,01:10:27.506
"So the first entry is
selected from the first set,",01:10:33.170,01:10:40.930
"the second entry is selected
from the second set, and so on.",01:10:40.930,01:10:45.590
"And now the product
rule tells us",01:10:48.630,01:10:51.550
"by just applying that
reasoning over here",01:10:51.550,01:10:58.470
"that the cardinality of the
product of all those sets",01:10:58.470,01:11:07.190
"is actually equal to the
cardinality of the first set",01:11:07.190,01:11:13.740
"multiplied by the
cardinality of the second set",01:11:13.740,01:11:16.570
"and so on up to the
cardinality of the last set.",01:11:16.570,01:11:20.210
"Because we have this
number of choices",01:11:20.210,01:11:23.760
"for the very first
element over here,",01:11:23.760,01:11:25.960
"this number of choices for
the second one, and so on.",01:11:25.960,01:11:28.730
"And we apply that rule, and we
see that this is the result.",01:11:28.730,01:11:33.860
"Now when we use this, in
specific to count all the n-bit",01:11:33.860,01:11:38.150
"sequences, we have exactly
2 choices for the first bit.",01:11:38.150,01:11:43.970
"We have to set 0,1 in our
example times the set 0, 1 over",01:11:43.970,01:11:50.010
here and so on.,01:11:50.010,01:11:53.520
"And that's how we derived that
we have 2 times 2, 2 the power",01:11:53.520,01:12:00.270
n choices for an n-bit sequence.,01:12:00.270,01:12:04.670
So now we come to the sum rule.,01:12:04.670,01:12:07.310
"And we will give an
example for that.",01:12:07.310,01:12:11.680
"So the sum rule states
that if you look at sets,",01:12:11.680,01:12:15.770
"then we may be able
to count their union.",01:12:15.770,01:12:18.700
"And we will consider
a very specific case.",01:12:18.700,01:12:20.610
"In the next lecture, we will
talk about the general case.",01:12:20.610,01:12:25.710
"So the sum rule is the
following counting mechanism.",01:12:25.710,01:12:33.500
"If the sets A1 up to
An are all disjoint,",01:12:33.500,01:12:41.020
"so they are disjoint
sets, then we",01:12:41.020,01:12:48.010
"know that if I try to count
the union of all those set,",01:12:48.010,01:12:54.580
"it's going to be the sum of
the separate cardinalities.",01:12:54.580,01:12:59.210
"So let me just write
it out actually.",01:12:59.210,01:13:02.830
"So it's the cardinality of
A1 plus A2 all the way to An.",01:13:02.830,01:13:12.250
Why is this?,01:13:12.250,01:13:13.470
"Well, all the sets are disjoint.",01:13:13.470,01:13:16.210
"So there are no
intersections between sets",01:13:16.210,01:13:21.270
that contain elements.,01:13:21.270,01:13:22.370
All the intersections are empty.,01:13:22.370,01:13:24.580
"So counting the union is really
counting each separate set.",01:13:24.580,01:13:30.310
And that's why we have the sum.,01:13:30.310,01:13:32.770
"And in the next lecture, we
will talk about inclusion,",01:13:32.770,01:13:35.070
exclusion rule.,01:13:35.070,01:13:36.484
"And then we will
take into account",01:13:36.484,01:13:37.900
"that we have intersections
that are not empty.",01:13:37.900,01:13:41.020
"But let's give now
an example where",01:13:41.020,01:13:44.110
"we count the number of passwords
with certain properties.",01:13:44.110,01:13:52.900
"And we will apply all these
different rules together.",01:13:52.900,01:13:56.784
"And that's the type
of problems that you",01:13:56.784,01:13:58.450
would like to be able to solve.,01:13:58.450,01:14:01.350
"So in our last example
here, we have that passwords",01:14:01.350,01:14:08.380
have the following property.,01:14:08.380,01:14:10.390
They are 6 to 8 symbols.,01:14:14.850,01:14:17.305
So that's property 1.,01:14:22.110,01:14:25.280
"We have that the
very first symbol",01:14:25.280,01:14:27.920
"must be special in the
sense that it is a letter.",01:14:27.920,01:14:32.398
"And this can an
upper or lowercase.",01:14:37.180,01:14:42.320
"And say that the other symbols
are actually letters or digits.",01:14:46.830,01:14:59.180
"So let's count the total
number of possible passwords.",01:14:59.180,01:15:03.720
We're going to use the sum rule.,01:15:03.720,01:15:06.150
"So let's define
what kinds of sets",01:15:06.150,01:15:10.530
we are taking the symbols from.,01:15:10.530,01:15:13.480
"So the first set is
for the first symbol,",01:15:13.480,01:15:17.220
which we call f or first.,01:15:17.220,01:15:21.030
"We have all the letters
a, b, c in lowercase,",01:15:21.030,01:15:25.200
"and then all of
them in uppercase.",01:15:25.200,01:15:27.270
"And in total, we have
52 elements in this set.",01:15:30.430,01:15:37.900
"For the second symbol,
or the other symbols,",01:15:37.900,01:15:41.600
"we have all these
letters, but also",01:15:41.600,01:15:45.760
"all the digits, 0, 1, up to 9.",01:15:45.760,01:15:50.020
"And this set actually
has cardinality 62.",01:15:50.020,01:15:55.260
We added 10 digits.,01:15:55.260,01:15:58.960
"So let's talk
about-- actually, we",01:15:58.960,01:16:05.260
"like to use this in
the sum rule as well.",01:16:05.260,01:16:08.872
So how do we count?,01:16:18.600,01:16:20.270
"What kind of possibilities
do we really have?",01:16:20.270,01:16:22.150
"So let's describe
the set of passwords",01:16:22.150,01:16:25.170
explicitly in a formula.,01:16:25.170,01:16:27.940
"So let p be the set
of possible passwords.",01:16:27.940,01:16:32.331
"And this one is actually
equal to-- well,",01:16:38.110,01:16:42.390
I need to choose a first symbol.,01:16:42.390,01:16:45.050
"And then I need to choose a
second symbol, and a third,",01:16:45.050,01:16:51.070
"and a fourth, and a
fifth, and a sixth.",01:16:51.070,01:16:55.600
That's one possibility.,01:16:55.600,01:16:56.690
I use 6 symbols.,01:16:56.690,01:16:58.780
I can also use 7 or 8 symbols.,01:16:58.780,01:17:00.660
But this is one of them.,01:17:00.660,01:17:01.840
"We also denote this
as S to the power 5.",01:17:04.770,01:17:10.120
That's an equivalent notation.,01:17:10.120,01:17:11.385
"The other possibilities
for passwords",01:17:15.110,01:17:17.840
"are that we first choose
an entry from f, a letter.",01:17:17.840,01:17:24.510
"And then we will need to
choose another 6 symbols.",01:17:24.510,01:17:28.460
"In total, we have 7.",01:17:28.460,01:17:31.940
"And we have another possibility
where we choose a first symbol,",01:17:31.940,01:17:35.790
"and then we choose
7 other symbols.",01:17:35.790,01:17:39.290
So has 8 symbols.,01:17:39.290,01:17:40.570
This has in total 7.,01:17:40.570,01:17:41.880
This one has in total 6 symbols.,01:17:41.880,01:17:43.970
"So this covers all the
possible passwords.",01:17:43.970,01:17:47.730
So let's count them.,01:17:47.730,01:17:49.410
"We know that these sets
are all the different.",01:17:49.410,01:17:52.730
They are distinct.,01:17:52.730,01:17:54.590
"These are sequences that have
6 entries, 7, and 8 entries.",01:17:54.590,01:17:59.200
"So if you look at
the cardinality of P,",01:17:59.200,01:18:04.340
"it's actually equal to
the sum by the sum rule",01:18:04.340,01:18:07.710
"that we just
described over there,",01:18:07.710,01:18:12.130
"is equal to the very first
one, f times S to the power",01:18:12.130,01:18:17.900
"5 plus the cardinality
of the product",01:18:17.900,01:18:23.320
of f with S to the power 6.,01:18:23.320,01:18:26.800
"And we have f times
S to the power 7.",01:18:26.800,01:18:37.180
"So this is simply by
application of the sum rule.",01:18:37.180,01:18:41.580
"And now we can apply
the product rule",01:18:41.580,01:18:43.390
"very simply, which is this one.",01:18:43.390,01:18:46.060
"So that's equal
to the cardinality",01:18:46.060,01:18:49.120
"of f times the cardinality
of S to the power 5.",01:18:49.120,01:18:56.100
"And then we have the same
rule applied to this one.",01:18:56.100,01:18:59.550
"It's the commonality of
f times the cardinality",01:18:59.550,01:19:01.980
of S to the power 6.,01:19:01.980,01:19:04.840
"And then we have the cardinality
of f times the cardinality of S",01:19:04.840,01:19:08.590
to the power 7.,01:19:08.590,01:19:09.580
"Now, we simply
plug-in these numbers.",01:19:12.190,01:19:14.820
"And then you will have the
total number of passwords",01:19:14.820,01:19:18.979
that you can select from.,01:19:18.979,01:19:20.020
"It turns out to be about 1.8
times 10 to the power 14.",01:19:20.020,01:19:27.640
"So here we have applied both to
sum rule and the product rule.",01:19:27.640,01:19:30.320
"So in general, you
will see that you",01:19:30.320,01:19:32.026
"have to apply multiple
rules together",01:19:32.026,01:19:33.620
"in order to find an answer
to your counting problem.",01:19:33.620,01:19:37.750
"And you'll see that
on a problem set.",01:19:37.750,01:19:39.600
"And we will give a few more
examples in next lecture.",01:19:39.600,01:19:42.510
"And we will start talking about
the generalization of the sum",01:19:42.510,01:19:46.000
room called inclusion exclusion.,01:19:46.000,01:19:48.170
"And we will give you another
type of proof technique called",01:19:48.170,01:19:52.220
combinatorial proofs.,01:19:52.220,01:19:54.030
All right.,01:19:54.030,01:19:54.530
Good luck with the problems.,01:19:54.530,01:19:56.690
