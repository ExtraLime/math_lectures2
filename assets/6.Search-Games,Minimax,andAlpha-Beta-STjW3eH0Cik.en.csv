"SPEAKER 1: It was about 1963
when a noted philosopher here",00:00:08.928,00:00:12.580
"at MIT, named Hubert Dreyfus--",00:00:12.580,00:00:15.885
"Hubert Dreyfus wrote a paper in
about 1963 in which he had",00:00:20.642,00:00:30.330
"a heading titled, ""Computers
Can't Play Chess."" Of course,",00:00:30.330,00:00:37.610
"he was subsequently invited
over to the artificial",00:00:37.610,00:00:40.110
"intelligence laboratory
to play the",00:00:40.110,00:00:41.670
Greenblatt chess machine.,00:00:41.670,00:00:43.420
"And, of course, he lost.",00:00:43.420,00:00:46.650
"Whereupon Seymour Pavitt wrote
a rebuttal to Dreyfus' famous",00:00:46.650,00:00:52.200
"paper, which had a subject
heading, ""Dreyfus Can't Play",00:00:52.200,00:00:56.240
"Chess Either.""",00:00:56.240,00:00:59.840
"But in a strange sense, Dreyfus
might have been right",00:00:59.840,00:01:02.390
"and would have been right if he
were to have said computers",00:01:02.390,00:01:07.000
"can't play chess the way
humans play chess yet.",00:01:07.000,00:01:11.690
"In any case, around about 1968
a chess master named David",00:01:11.690,00:01:16.630
"Levy bet noted founder of
artificial intelligence John",00:01:16.630,00:01:23.000
"McCarthy that no computer would
beat the world champion",00:01:23.000,00:01:25.440
within 10 years.,00:01:25.440,00:01:27.730
"And five years later, McCarthy
gave up, because it had",00:01:27.730,00:01:31.740
"already become clear that no
computer would win in a way",00:01:31.740,00:01:36.510
"that McCarthy wanted it to win,
that is to say by playing",00:01:36.510,00:01:39.590
"chess the way humans
play chess.",00:01:39.590,00:01:42.960
"But then 20 years after that
in 1997, Deep Blue beat the",00:01:42.960,00:01:48.160
"world champion, and chess
suddenly became uninteresting.",00:01:48.160,00:01:52.160
"But we're going to talk about
games today, because there are",00:01:54.910,00:01:58.690
"elements of game-play that do
model some of the things that",00:01:58.690,00:02:01.720
go on in our head.,00:02:01.720,00:02:03.750
"And if they don't model things
that go on in our head, they",00:02:03.750,00:02:06.050
"do model some kind
of intelligence.",00:02:06.050,00:02:08.610
"And if we're to have a general
understanding of what",00:02:08.610,00:02:10.490
"intelligence is all about, we
have to understand that kind",00:02:10.490,00:02:13.690
"of intelligence, too.",00:02:13.690,00:02:16.000
"So, we'll start out by talking
about various ways that we",00:02:16.000,00:02:18.790
"might design a computer
program to",00:02:18.790,00:02:20.330
play a game like chess.,00:02:20.330,00:02:22.360
"And we'll conclude by talking
a little bit about what Deep",00:02:22.360,00:02:26.930
"Blue adds to the mix other
than tremendous speed.",00:02:26.930,00:02:32.460
"So, that's our agenda.",00:02:32.460,00:02:34.300
"By the end of the hour, you'll
understand and be able to",00:02:34.300,00:02:37.320
"write your own Deep Blue
if you feel like it.",00:02:37.320,00:02:40.290
"First, we want to talk about how
it might be possible for a",00:02:40.290,00:02:44.270
computer to play chess.,00:02:44.270,00:02:45.590
"Let's talk about several
approaches",00:02:45.590,00:02:48.250
that might be possible.,00:02:48.250,00:02:50.220
"Approach number one is that
the machine might make a",00:02:50.220,00:02:53.860
"description of the board the
same way a human would; talk",00:02:53.860,00:02:56.980
"about pawn structure, King
safety, whether it's a good",00:02:56.980,00:03:00.000
"time to castle, that
sort of thing.",00:03:00.000,00:03:01.960
"So, it would be analysis and
perhaps some strategy mixed up",00:03:01.960,00:03:12.130
with some tactics.,00:03:12.130,00:03:13.380
"And all that would get mixed
up and, finally, result in",00:03:15.870,00:03:20.190
some kind of move.,00:03:20.190,00:03:22.710
"If this is the game board, the
next thing to do would be",00:03:22.710,00:03:27.450
"determined by some process
like that.",00:03:27.450,00:03:29.400
"And the trouble is no one
knows how to do it.",00:03:29.400,00:03:33.730
"And so in that sense,
Dreyfus is right.",00:03:33.730,00:03:35.180
"None the game playing programs
today incorporate any of that",00:03:35.180,00:03:38.830
kind of stuff.,00:03:38.830,00:03:41.350
"And since nobody knows
how to do that, we",00:03:41.350,00:03:43.600
can't talk about it.,00:03:43.600,00:03:44.420
"So we can talk about
other ways, though,",00:03:44.420,00:03:45.610
that we might try.,00:03:45.610,00:03:46.830
"For example, we can have
if-then rules.",00:03:46.830,00:03:48.450
How would that work?,00:03:55.820,00:03:56.740
That would work this way.,00:03:56.740,00:03:57.840
"You look at the board,
represented by this node here,",00:03:57.840,00:04:01.770
"and you say, well, if it's
possible to move the Queen",00:04:01.770,00:04:09.970
"pawn forward by one,
then do that.",00:04:09.970,00:04:13.390
"So, it doesn't do any of
evaluation of the board.",00:04:13.390,00:04:16.010
It doesn't try anything.,00:04:16.010,00:04:19.290
"It just says let me look at the
board and select a move on",00:04:19.290,00:04:22.360
that basis.,00:04:22.360,00:04:24.170
"So, that would be a way
of approaching a game",00:04:24.170,00:04:28.130
situation like this.,00:04:28.130,00:04:30.760
Here's the situation.,00:04:30.760,00:04:32.430
Here are the possible moves.,00:04:32.430,00:04:34.060
"And one is selected
on the basis of an",00:04:34.060,00:04:36.130
if-then rule like so.,00:04:36.130,00:04:40.180
"And nobody can make a very
strong chess player",00:04:40.180,00:04:42.195
that works like that.,00:04:42.195,00:04:43.350
"Curiously enough, someone has
made a pretty good checkers",00:04:43.350,00:04:46.100
"playing program that
works like that.",00:04:46.100,00:04:49.326
"It checks to see what moves are
available on the board,",00:04:49.326,00:04:53.110
"ranks them, and picks the
highest one available.",00:04:53.110,00:04:57.290
"But, in general, that's not
a very good approach.",00:04:57.290,00:04:58.920
It's not very powerful.,00:04:58.920,00:04:59.860
You couldn't make it--,00:04:59.860,00:05:01.670
"well, when I say, couldn't, it
means I can't think of any way",00:05:01.670,00:05:03.900
"that you could make a
strong chess playing",00:05:03.900,00:05:05.530
program that way.,00:05:05.530,00:05:06.780
"So, the third way to do this is
to look ahead and evaluate.",00:05:09.260,00:05:19.055
"What that means is you
look ahead like so.",00:05:24.090,00:05:26.410
"You see all the possible
consequences of moves, and you",00:05:26.410,00:05:29.790
"say, which of these board
situations is best for me?",00:05:29.790,00:05:33.740
"So, that would be an approach
that comes in here like so and",00:05:33.740,00:05:37.210
"says, which one of those three
situations is best?",00:05:37.210,00:05:41.780
"And to do that, we have to have
some way of evaluating",00:05:41.780,00:05:45.990
"the situation deciding which
of those is best.",00:05:45.990,00:05:50.770
"Now, I want to do a little,
brief aside, because I want to",00:05:50.770,00:05:53.710
"talk about the mechanisms that
are popularly used to do that",00:05:53.710,00:05:56.670
kind of evaluation.,00:05:56.670,00:05:59.420
"In the end, there are lots of
features of the chessboard.",00:05:59.420,00:06:02.560
"Let's call them f1,
f2, and so on.",00:06:02.560,00:06:05.680
"And we might form some function
of those features.",00:06:08.830,00:06:12.380
"And that, overall, is called
the static value.",00:06:12.380,00:06:16.190
"So, it's static because you're
not exploring any consequences",00:06:16.190,00:06:19.400
of what might happen.,00:06:19.400,00:06:20.250
"You're just looking at the board
as it is, checking the",00:06:20.250,00:06:22.525
"King's safety, checking
the pawn structure.",00:06:22.525,00:06:25.080
"Each of those produces a number
fed into this function,",00:06:25.080,00:06:28.440
out comes a value.,00:06:28.440,00:06:30.380
"And that is a value of the
board seen from your",00:06:30.380,00:06:33.960
perspective.,00:06:33.960,00:06:36.160
"Now, normally, this function,
g, is reduced to a linear",00:06:36.160,00:06:42.370
polynomial.,00:06:42.370,00:06:43.990
"So, in the end, the most popular
kind of way of forming",00:06:43.990,00:06:47.330
"a static value is to take f1,
multiply it times some",00:06:47.330,00:06:52.120
"constant, c1, add c2, multiply
it times f2.",00:06:52.120,00:06:57.290
"And that is a linear
scoring polynomial.",00:07:02.560,00:07:10.973
"So, we could use that function
to produce numbers from each",00:07:18.880,00:07:21.610
"of these things and then pick
the highest number.",00:07:21.610,00:07:24.150
"And that would be a way
of playing the game.",00:07:24.150,00:07:26.640
"Actually, a scoring polynomial
is a little bit",00:07:26.640,00:07:29.220
more than we need.,00:07:29.220,00:07:29.940
"Because all we really need is
a method that looks at those",00:07:29.940,00:07:33.910
"three boards and says,
I like this one best.",00:07:33.910,00:07:36.990
It doesn't have to rank them.,00:07:36.990,00:07:38.490
"It doesn't have to give
them numbers.",00:07:38.490,00:07:40.340
"All it has to do is say which
one it likes best.",00:07:40.340,00:07:43.500
"So, one way of doing that is
to use a linear scoring",00:07:43.500,00:07:45.690
polynomial.,00:07:45.690,00:07:46.240
"But it's not the only
way of doing that.",00:07:46.240,00:07:49.940
"So, that's number two
and number three.",00:07:49.940,00:07:53.980
But now what else might we do?,00:07:53.980,00:07:58.410
"Well, if we reflect back on some
of the searches we talked",00:07:58.410,00:08:01.210
"about, what's the base case
against which everything else",00:08:01.210,00:08:04.320
"is compared much the way of
doing search that doesn't",00:08:04.320,00:08:07.800
"require any intelligence,
just brute force?",00:08:07.800,00:08:10.910
"We could use the British Museum
algorithm and simply",00:08:10.910,00:08:13.630
"evaluate the entire tree of
possibilities; I move, you",00:08:13.630,00:08:17.770
"move, I move, you move,
all the way down to--",00:08:17.770,00:08:20.540
what?--,00:08:23.370,00:08:25.726
"maybe 100, 50 moves.",00:08:25.726,00:08:28.800
You do 50 things.,00:08:28.800,00:08:29.770
I do 50 things.,00:08:29.770,00:08:31.750
"So, before we can decide if
that's a good idea or not, we",00:08:31.750,00:08:35.500
"probably ought to develop
some vocabulary.",00:08:35.500,00:08:38.754
"So, consider this
tree of moves.",00:08:50.160,00:08:58.000
"There will be some
number of choices",00:08:58.000,00:09:02.530
considered at each level.,00:09:02.530,00:09:04.285
"And there will be some
number of levels.",00:09:04.285,00:09:07.250
"So, the standard language for
this as we call this the",00:09:07.250,00:09:09.910
branching factor.,00:09:09.910,00:09:11.160
"And in this particular case,
b is equal to 3.",00:09:18.880,00:09:23.340
This is the depth of the tree.,00:09:23.340,00:09:30.250
"And, in this case, d is two.",00:09:30.250,00:09:34.280
"So, now that produces a certain
number of terminal or",00:09:34.280,00:09:37.750
leaf nodes.,00:09:37.750,00:09:39.000
How many of those are there?,00:09:44.060,00:09:45.875
"Well, that's pretty simple
computation.",00:09:49.020,00:09:50.170
It's just b to the d.,00:09:50.170,00:09:51.840
"Right, Christopher,
b to the d?",00:09:51.840,00:09:55.330
"So, if you have b to the d at
this level, you have one.",00:09:55.330,00:10:01.660
"b to the d at this level,
you have b.",00:10:01.660,00:10:04.670
"b to the d at this level, you
have [? d ?] squared.",00:10:04.670,00:10:09.020
"So, b to the d, in this
particular case, is 9.",00:10:09.020,00:10:14.030
"So, now we can use this
vocabulary that we've",00:10:17.090,00:10:19.310
"developed to talk about whether
it's reasonable to",00:10:19.310,00:10:21.770
"just do the British Museum
algorithm, be done with it,",00:10:21.770,00:10:24.990
"forget about chess,
and go home.",00:10:24.990,00:10:28.500
"Well, let's see.",00:10:28.500,00:10:29.750
It's pretty deep down there.,00:10:32.450,00:10:35.050
"If we think about chess, and we
think about a standard game",00:10:35.050,00:10:39.290
"which each person does
50 things, that",00:10:39.290,00:10:41.970
gives a d about 100.,00:10:41.970,00:10:45.080
"And if you think about the
branching factor in chess,",00:10:45.080,00:10:47.490
"it's generally presumed to be,
depending on the stage of the",00:10:47.490,00:10:50.430
"game and so on and so forth,
it varies, but it might",00:10:50.430,00:10:52.870
average around 14 or 15.,00:10:52.870,00:10:55.940
"If it were just 10, that would
be 10 to the 100th.",00:10:55.940,00:10:59.620
"But it's a little more than
that, because the branching",00:10:59.620,00:11:01.310
factor is more than 10.,00:11:01.310,00:11:03.930
"So, in the end, it looks like,
according to Claude Shannon,",00:11:03.930,00:11:09.300
"there are about 10 to the 120th
leaf nodes down there.",00:11:09.300,00:11:16.160
"And if you're going to go to a
British Museum treatment of",00:11:16.160,00:11:18.930
"this tree, you'd have to do
10 to the 120th static",00:11:18.930,00:11:21.990
"evaluations down there at the
bottom if you're going to see",00:11:21.990,00:11:28.310
"which one of the moves
is best at the top.",00:11:28.310,00:11:32.080
Is that a reasonable number?,00:11:32.080,00:11:33.850
"It didn't used to seem
practicable.",00:11:33.850,00:11:38.622
It used to seem impossible.,00:11:38.622,00:11:41.460
"But now we've got cloud
computing and everything.",00:11:41.460,00:11:43.400
"And maybe we could actually
do that, right?",00:11:43.400,00:11:48.180
"What do you think, Vanessa, can
you do that, get enough",00:11:48.180,00:11:51.440
computers going in the cloud?,00:11:51.440,00:11:54.940
No?,00:11:54.940,00:11:55.385
You're not sure?,00:11:55.385,00:11:57.150
Should we work it out?,00:11:57.150,00:11:59.350
Let's work it out.,00:11:59.350,00:12:00.520
"I'll need some help, especially
from any of you who",00:12:00.520,00:12:04.170

38th has been offered.",00:12:16.792,00:12:19.300
That's why it's way too low.,00:12:19.300,00:12:22.376
"The last time I looked, it was
about 10 to the 80th atoms in",00:12:22.376,00:12:25.760
the universe.,00:12:25.760,00:12:27.010
"The next thing I'd like to know
is how many seconds are",00:12:33.940,00:12:35.900
there in a year?,00:12:35.900,00:12:37.232
"It's a good number
have memorized.",00:12:37.232,00:12:41.200
"That number is approximately
pi times 10 to the seventh.",00:12:41.200,00:12:53.350
"So, how many nanoseconds
in a second?",00:12:53.350,00:12:56.190
That gives us 10 to the ninth.,00:12:56.190,00:13:03.410
"At last, how many years
are there in the",00:13:03.410,00:13:06.670
history of the universe?,00:13:06.670,00:13:07.920
SPEAKER 3: [INAUDIBLE].,00:13:10.040,00:13:12.480
14.7 billion.,00:13:12.480,00:13:15.790
"SPEAKER 1: She offers something
on the order of 10",00:13:15.790,00:13:18.150
"billion, maybe 14 billion.",00:13:18.150,00:13:21.960
"But we'll say 10 billion to make
our calculation simple.",00:13:21.960,00:13:26.130
That's 10 to the 10th years.,00:13:26.130,00:13:31.630
"If we will add that up, 80, 90,
plus 16, that's 10 to the",00:13:31.630,00:13:38.300
"106th nanoseconds in the history
of the universe.",00:13:38.300,00:13:50.540
"Multiply it times the number
of atoms in the universe.",00:13:50.540,00:13:52.580
"So, if all of the atoms in the
universe were doing static",00:13:52.580,00:13:56.900
"evaluations at nanosecond speeds
since the beginning of",00:13:56.900,00:14:00.740
"the Big Bang, we'd still be 14
orders of magnitudes short.",00:14:00.740,00:14:06.640
"So, it'd be a pretty
good cloud.",00:14:06.640,00:14:08.120
"It would have to harness
together lots of universes.",00:14:08.120,00:14:11.395
"So, the British Museum
algorithm is",00:14:15.080,00:14:16.660
not going to work.,00:14:16.660,00:14:17.910
No good.,00:14:35.650,00:14:37.700
"So, what we're going to have to
do is we're going to have",00:14:37.700,00:14:39.460
"to put some things together
and hope for the best.",00:14:39.460,00:14:43.090
"So, the fifth way is the way
we're actually going to do it.",00:14:43.090,00:14:46.680
"And what we're going to do is
we're going to look ahead, not",00:14:46.680,00:14:53.580
"just one level, but as
far as possible.",00:14:53.580,00:14:55.410
"We consider, not only the
situation that we've developed",00:15:07.120,00:15:11.460
"here, but we'll try to push that
out as far as we can and",00:15:11.460,00:15:15.390
"look at these static values of
the leaf nodes down here and",00:15:15.390,00:15:21.430
"somehow use that as a way
of playing the game.",00:15:21.430,00:15:24.970
"So, that is number five.",00:15:24.970,00:15:27.885
"And number four is going
all the way down there.",00:15:27.885,00:15:30.830
"And this, in the end, is
all that we can do.",00:15:30.830,00:15:34.850
"This idea is multiply invented
most notably by Claude Shannon",00:15:34.850,00:15:45.240
"and also by Alan Turing, who,
I found out from a friend of",00:15:45.240,00:15:51.150
"mine, spent a lot a lunch time
conversations talking with",00:15:51.150,00:15:56.460
"each other about how a computer
might play chess",00:15:56.460,00:16:01.130
"against the future when there
would be computers.",00:16:01.130,00:16:04.850
"So, Donald, Mickey and Alan
Turing also invented this over",00:16:04.850,00:16:08.300
"lunch while they were taking
some time off from cracking",00:16:08.300,00:16:12.010
the German codes.,00:16:12.010,00:16:14.730
"Well, what is the method?",00:16:14.730,00:16:17.710
"I want to illustrate the method
with the simplest",00:16:17.710,00:16:20.290
possible tree.,00:16:20.290,00:16:21.700
"So, we're going to have a
branching factor of 2 not 14.",00:16:21.700,00:16:24.600
"And we're going to have a
depth of 2 not something",00:16:24.600,00:16:27.920
highly serious.,00:16:27.920,00:16:29.570
Here's the game tree.,00:16:32.170,00:16:34.360
"And there are going
to be some numbers",00:16:34.360,00:16:35.510
down here at the bottom.,00:16:35.510,00:16:36.760
"And these are going to be the
value of the board from the",00:16:39.430,00:16:42.390
"perspective of the player
at the top.",00:16:42.390,00:16:46.060
"Let us say that the player at
the top would like to drive",00:16:46.060,00:16:48.210
"the play as much as possible
toward the big numbers.",00:16:48.210,00:16:52.330
"So, we're going to call that
player the maximizing player.",00:16:52.330,00:16:54.750
"He would like to get over here
to the 8, because that's the",00:16:58.440,00:17:01.270
biggest number.,00:17:01.270,00:17:02.940
"There's another player, his
opponent, which we'll call the",00:17:02.940,00:17:04.740
minimizing player.,00:17:04.740,00:17:06.440
"And he's hoping that the play
will go down to the board",00:17:06.440,00:17:10.109
"situation that's as
small as possible.",00:17:10.109,00:17:11.950
"Because his view is the opposite
of the maximizing",00:17:11.950,00:17:14.930
"player, hence the
name minimax.",00:17:14.930,00:17:19.040
But how does it work?,00:17:19.040,00:17:20.770
"Do you see which way the
play is going to go?",00:17:20.770,00:17:24.520
"How do you decide which way
the play is going to go?",00:17:24.520,00:17:27.990
"Well, it's not obvious
at a glance.",00:17:27.990,00:17:30.650
"Do you see which way
it's going to go?",00:17:30.650,00:17:33.230
"It's not obvious
to the glance.",00:17:33.230,00:17:34.980
"But if we do more than a glance,
if we look at the",00:17:34.980,00:17:39.160
"situation from the perspective
of the minimizing player here",00:17:39.160,00:17:42.150
"at the middle level, it's
pretty clear that if the",00:17:42.150,00:17:44.360
"minimizing player finds himself
in that situation,",00:17:44.360,00:17:48.570
"he's going to choose
to go that way.",00:17:48.570,00:17:51.480
"And so the value of this
situation, from the",00:17:51.480,00:17:56.830
"perspective of the minimizing
player, is 2.",00:17:56.830,00:18:00.652
"He'd never go over
there to the 7.",00:18:00.652,00:18:03.480
"Similarly, if the minimizing
player is over here with a",00:18:03.480,00:18:07.200
"choice between going toward
a 1 or toward an 8, he'll",00:18:07.200,00:18:09.700
obviously go toward a 1.,00:18:09.700,00:18:11.900
"And so the value of that board
situation, from the",00:18:11.900,00:18:16.850
"perspective of the minimizing
player, is 1.",00:18:16.850,00:18:20.340
"Now, we've taken the scores down
here at the bottom of the",00:18:20.340,00:18:22.550
"tree, and we back them
up one level.",00:18:22.550,00:18:25.710
"And you see how we can
just keep doing this?",00:18:25.710,00:18:28.840
"Now the maximizing player can
see that if he goes to the",00:18:28.840,00:18:32.160
"left, he gets a score of 2.",00:18:32.160,00:18:34.605
"If he goes to the right, he
only gets a score of 1.",00:18:34.605,00:18:37.360
"So, he's going to
go to the left.",00:18:37.360,00:18:39.800
"So, overall, then, the
maximizing player is going to",00:18:39.800,00:18:42.980
"have a 2 as the perceived value
of that situation there",00:18:42.980,00:18:48.790
at the top.,00:18:48.790,00:18:50.740
That's the minimax algorithm.,00:18:50.740,00:18:51.790
It's very simple.,00:18:51.790,00:18:53.390
"You go down to the bottom of the
tree, you compute static",00:18:53.390,00:18:56.250
"values, you back them up level
by level, and then you decide",00:18:56.250,00:19:00.570
where to go.,00:19:00.570,00:19:01.585
"And in this particular
situation, the maximizer goes",00:19:01.585,00:19:05.390
to the left.,00:19:05.390,00:19:05.890
"And the minimizer goes to the
left, too, so the play ends up",00:19:05.890,00:19:08.770
"here, far short of the 8 that
the maximizer wanted and less",00:19:08.770,00:19:13.680
"than the 1 that the
minimizer wanted.",00:19:13.680,00:19:15.460
"But this is an adversarial
game.",00:19:15.460,00:19:17.100
"You're competing with
each other.",00:19:17.100,00:19:18.230
"So, you don't expect to get
what you want, right?",00:19:18.230,00:19:21.280
"So, maybe we ought to see if
we can make that work.",00:19:23.930,00:19:25.660
There's a game tree.,00:19:33.320,00:19:34.100
Do you see how it goes?,00:19:34.100,00:19:35.350
"Let's see if the system
can figure it out.",00:19:38.630,00:19:42.730
"There it goes, crawling its
way through the tree.",00:19:42.730,00:19:46.350
"This is a branching factor of
2, just like our sample, but",00:19:46.350,00:19:49.310
now four levels.,00:19:49.310,00:19:51.540
"You can see that it's got quite
a lot of work to do.",00:19:51.540,00:19:53.700
"That's 2 to the fourth, one,
two, three, four, 2 to the",00:19:53.700,00:20:01.175
"fourth, 16 static evaluations
to do.",00:20:01.175,00:20:06.790
"So, it found the answer.",00:20:06.790,00:20:07.850
But it's a lot of work.,00:20:07.850,00:20:09.120
"We could get a new tree and
restart it, maybe speed it up.",00:20:09.120,00:20:13.290
"There is goes down that
way, get a new tree.",00:20:17.960,00:20:22.310
Those are just random numbers.,00:20:22.310,00:20:23.270
"So, each time it's going to find
a different path through",00:20:23.270,00:20:25.360
"the tree according to the
numbers that it's generated.",00:20:25.360,00:20:30.330
"Now, 16 isn't bad.",00:20:30.330,00:20:32.070
"But if you get down there around
10 levels deep and your",00:20:32.070,00:20:34.620
"branching factor is 14, well,
we know those numbers get",00:20:34.620,00:20:36.850
"pretty awful pretty bad, because
the number of static",00:20:36.850,00:20:39.290
"evaluations to do down
there at the bottom",00:20:39.290,00:20:41.105
goes as b to the d.,00:20:41.105,00:20:43.830
It's exponential.,00:20:43.830,00:20:45.080
"And time has shown, if you get
down about seven or eight",00:20:47.260,00:20:50.350
"levels, you're a jerk.",00:20:50.350,00:20:51.845
"And if you get down about 15
or 16 levels, you beat the",00:20:51.845,00:20:54.450
world champion.,00:20:54.450,00:20:55.900
"So, you'd like to get as far
down in the tree as possible.",00:20:55.900,00:20:58.630
"Because when you get as far
down into the tree as",00:20:58.630,00:21:02.480
"possible, what happens is as
these that these crude",00:21:02.480,00:21:04.510
"measures of bored quality
begin to clarify.",00:21:04.510,00:21:09.720
"And, in fact, when you get far
enough, the only thing that",00:21:09.720,00:21:11.910
"really counts is piece count,
one of those features.",00:21:11.910,00:21:15.890
"If you get far enough, piece
count and a few other things",00:21:15.890,00:21:18.750
"will give you a pretty good idea
of what to do if you get",00:21:18.750,00:21:21.150
far enough.,00:21:21.150,00:21:23.990
"But getting far enough
can be a problem.",00:21:23.990,00:21:25.510
"So, we want to do everything
we can to",00:21:25.510,00:21:27.400
get as far as possible.,00:21:27.400,00:21:28.935
"We want to pull out every trick
we can find to get as",00:21:28.935,00:21:31.970
far as possible.,00:21:31.970,00:21:33.500
"Now, you remember when we talked
about branching down,",00:21:33.500,00:21:38.450
"we knew that there were some
things that we could do that",00:21:38.450,00:21:39.955
"would cut off whole portions
of the search tree.",00:21:39.955,00:21:43.330
"So, what we'd like to do is find
something analogous to",00:21:43.330,00:21:45.380
"this world of games, so we cut
off whole portions of this",00:21:45.380,00:21:48.270
"search tree, so we don't
have to look at",00:21:48.270,00:21:49.880
those static values.,00:21:49.880,00:21:52.180
"What I want to do is I want to
come back and redo this thing.",00:21:52.180,00:21:55.330
"But this time, I'm going
to compute the static",00:21:55.330,00:21:56.780
values one at a time.,00:21:56.780,00:21:59.030
"I've got the same structure
in the tree.",00:21:59.030,00:22:03.190
"And just as before, I'm going to
assume that the top player",00:22:03.190,00:22:06.110
"wants to go toward the maximum
values, and the next player",00:22:06.110,00:22:08.490
"wants to go toward the
minimum values.",00:22:08.490,00:22:10.380
"But none of the static values
have been computed yet.",00:22:10.380,00:22:13.950
"So, I better start
computing them.",00:22:13.950,00:22:16.770
"That's the first
one I find, 2.",00:22:16.770,00:22:19.226
"Now, as soon as I see that 2, as
soon as the minimizer sees",00:22:19.226,00:22:21.840
"that 2, the minimizer knows that
the value of this node",00:22:21.840,00:22:25.580
can't be any greater than 2.,00:22:25.580,00:22:27.390
"Because he'll always choose to
go down this way if this",00:22:27.390,00:22:30.020
"branch produces a
bigger number.",00:22:30.020,00:22:32.390
"So, we can say that the
minimizer is assured already",00:22:32.390,00:22:35.910
"that the score there will be
equal to or less than 2.",00:22:35.910,00:22:40.580
"Now, we go over and compute
the next number.",00:22:40.580,00:22:43.580
There's a 7.,00:22:43.580,00:22:44.980
"Now, I know this is exactly
equal to 2, because he'll",00:22:44.980,00:22:46.850
never go down toward a 7.,00:22:46.850,00:22:49.570
"As soon as the minimizer says
equal to 2, the maximizer",00:22:49.570,00:22:52.420
"says, OK, I can do equal
to or greater than 2.",00:22:52.420,00:22:55.390
"One, minimizer says equal
to or less than 1.",00:23:00.560,00:23:06.010
Now what?,00:23:06.010,00:23:08.142
"Did you prepare those
2 numbers?",00:23:08.142,00:23:12.275
"The maximizer knows that if he
goes down here, he can't do",00:23:12.275,00:23:16.360
better than 1.,00:23:16.360,00:23:17.990
"He already knows if he goes
over here, he an get a 2.",00:23:17.990,00:23:23.510
"It's as if this branch
doesn't even exist.",00:23:23.510,00:23:27.850
"Because the maximizer would
never choose to go down there.",00:23:27.850,00:23:31.840
"So, you have to see that.",00:23:31.840,00:23:33.160
"This is the important essence
of the notion the alpha-beta",00:23:33.160,00:23:38.330
"algorithm, which is a layering
on top of minimax that cuts",00:23:38.330,00:23:41.630
"off large sections of
the search tree.",00:23:41.630,00:23:44.870
"So, one more time.",00:23:44.870,00:23:47.420
"We've developed a situation so
we know that the maximizer",00:23:47.420,00:23:49.620
"gets a 2 going down to the left,
and he sees that if he",00:23:49.620,00:23:54.720
"goes down to the right, he
can't do better than 1.",00:23:54.720,00:23:58.000
"So, he says to himself, it's
as if that branch doesn't",00:23:58.000,00:24:01.420
"exist and the overall
score is 2.",00:24:01.420,00:24:05.230
"And it doesn't matter what
that static value is.",00:24:05.230,00:24:08.980
"It can be 8, as it was,
it can be plus 1,000.",00:24:08.980,00:24:13.350
It doesn't matter.,00:24:13.350,00:24:14.015
"It can be minus 1,000.",00:24:14.015,00:24:16.040
"Or it could be plus infinity
or minus infinity.",00:24:16.040,00:24:19.420
"It doesn't matter, because
the maximizer will always",00:24:19.420,00:24:23.620
go the other way.,00:24:23.620,00:24:26.470
"So, that's the alpha-beta
algorithm.",00:24:26.470,00:24:29.270
"Can you guess why it's called
the alpha-beta algorithm?",00:24:29.270,00:24:32.300
"Well, because in the algorithm
there are two parameters,",00:24:32.300,00:24:34.210
alpha and beta.,00:24:34.210,00:24:37.080
"So, it's important to understand
that alpha-beta is",00:24:37.080,00:24:38.750
not an alternative to minimax.,00:24:38.750,00:24:41.810
It's minimax with a flourish.,00:24:41.810,00:24:44.230
"It's something layered on top
like we layered things on top",00:24:44.230,00:24:47.610
"of branch and bound to make
it more efficient.",00:24:47.610,00:24:49.605
"We layer stuff on top
of minimax to",00:24:49.605,00:24:52.290
make it more efficient.,00:24:52.290,00:24:55.300
"As you say to me, well, that's
a pretty easy example.",00:24:55.300,00:24:57.250
And it is.,00:24:57.250,00:24:57.700
"So, let's try a little
bit more complex one.",00:24:57.700,00:24:59.810
"This is just to see if I can
do it without screwing up.",00:25:07.330,00:25:09.550
"The reason I do one that's
complex is not just to show",00:25:12.220,00:25:15.320
"how tough I am in front
of a large audience.",00:25:15.320,00:25:17.640
"But, rather, there's certain
points of interest that only",00:25:17.640,00:25:20.450
"occur in a tree of depth
four or greater.",00:25:20.450,00:25:24.030
"That's the reason for
this example.",00:25:24.030,00:25:26.010
"But work with me and let's
see if we can work",00:25:26.010,00:25:28.120
our way through it.,00:25:28.120,00:25:29.670
"What I'm going to do is I'll
circle the numbers that we",00:25:29.670,00:25:34.810
actually have to compute.,00:25:34.810,00:25:36.790
"So, we actually have
to compute 8.",00:25:36.790,00:25:39.480
"As soon as we do that, the
minimizer knows that that node",00:25:39.480,00:25:42.430
"is going to have a score of
equal to or less than 8",00:25:42.430,00:25:44.450
"without looking at
anything else.",00:25:44.450,00:25:46.960
"Then, he looks at 7.",00:25:46.960,00:25:50.020
"So, that's equal to 7.",00:25:50.020,00:25:51.516
"Because the minimizer will
clearly go to the right.",00:25:51.516,00:25:54.910
"As soon as that is determined,
then the maximizer knows that",00:25:54.910,00:25:57.330
"the score here is equal
to or greater than 8.",00:25:57.330,00:26:00.580
"Now, we evaluate the 3.",00:26:00.580,00:26:03.680
"The minimizer knows equal
to or less than 3.",00:26:03.680,00:26:06.418
SPEAKER 4: [INAUDIBLE].,00:26:06.418,00:26:09.286
"SPEAKER 1: Oh, sorry, the
minimizer at 7, yeah.",00:26:09.286,00:26:14.920
"OK, now what happens?",00:26:14.920,00:26:17.930
"Well, let's see, the maximizer
gets a 7 going that way.",00:26:17.930,00:26:20.240
"He can't do better than 3 going
that way, so we got",00:26:20.240,00:26:22.180
"another one of these
cut off situations.",00:26:22.180,00:26:24.980
"It's as if this branch
doesn't even exist.",00:26:24.980,00:26:28.820
"So, this static evaluation
need not be made.",00:26:28.820,00:26:32.860
"And now we know that that's not
merely equal to or greater",00:26:32.860,00:26:35.670
"than 7, but exactly
equal to 7.",00:26:35.670,00:26:37.850
"And we can push that
number back up.",00:26:37.850,00:26:40.530
"That becomes equal to
or less than 7.",00:26:40.530,00:26:43.900
"OK, are you with me so far?",00:26:43.900,00:26:46.360
"Let's get over to the other
side of the tree",00:26:46.360,00:26:47.620
as quickly as possible.,00:26:47.620,00:26:49.300
"So, there's a 9, equal to or
less than 9, 8 equal to 8,",00:26:49.300,00:26:55.410
"push the 8 up equal
or greater than 8.",00:26:55.410,00:27:00.820
"The minimizer can go down
this way and get a 7.",00:27:03.360,00:27:06.740
"He'll certainly never go
that way where the",00:27:06.740,00:27:09.020
maximizer can get an 8.,00:27:09.020,00:27:11.780
"Once again, we've
got a cut off.",00:27:11.780,00:27:13.706
"And if this branch didn't exist,
then that means that",00:27:13.706,00:27:17.900
"these static evaluations
don't have to be made.",00:27:17.900,00:27:21.020
"And this value is
now exactly 7.",00:27:21.020,00:27:25.150
"But there's one more
thing to note here.",00:27:25.150,00:27:27.340
"And that is that not only do
we not have to make these",00:27:27.340,00:27:29.510
"static evaluations down here,
but we don't even have to",00:27:29.510,00:27:32.830
generate these moves.,00:27:32.830,00:27:35.040
"So, we save two ways, both on
static evaluation and on move",00:27:35.040,00:27:38.210
generation.,00:27:38.210,00:27:40.390
"This is a real winner, this
alpha-beta thing, because it",00:27:40.390,00:27:42.770
"saves as enormous amount
of computation.",00:27:42.770,00:27:44.285
"Well, we're on the way now.",00:27:47.130,00:27:47.930
"The maximizer up here is
guaranteed equal to or",00:27:47.930,00:27:50.470
greater than 7.,00:27:50.470,00:27:51.220
"Has anyone found the winning
media move yet?",00:27:51.220,00:27:53.990
Is it to the left?,00:27:53.990,00:27:56.050
"I know that we better keep
going, because we want to",00:27:56.050,00:27:59.240
trust any oracles.,00:27:59.240,00:28:00.490
"So, let's see.",00:28:04.150,00:28:05.090
There's a 1.,00:28:05.090,00:28:05.780
We've calculated that.,00:28:05.780,00:28:06.700
"The minimizer can be guaranteed
equal to or less",00:28:06.700,00:28:08.950
"than 1 at that particular
point.",00:28:08.950,00:28:11.050
Think about that for a while.,00:28:15.130,00:28:17.040
"At the top, the maximizer
knows he can go",00:28:17.040,00:28:19.470
left and get a 7.,00:28:19.470,00:28:23.161
"the minimizer, if the play ever
gets here, can ensure",00:28:23.161,00:28:28.610
"that he's going to drive the
situation to a board",00:28:28.610,00:28:30.860
number that's 1.,00:28:30.860,00:28:33.240
"So, the question is will
the maximizer ever",00:28:33.240,00:28:35.150
permit that to happen?,00:28:35.150,00:28:37.080
And the answer is surely not.,00:28:37.080,00:28:39.920
"So, over here in the development
of this side of",00:28:39.920,00:28:42.090
"the tree, we're always comparing
numbers at adjacent",00:28:42.090,00:28:44.870
levels in the tree.,00:28:44.870,00:28:46.530
"But here's a situation where
we're comparing numbers that",00:28:46.530,00:28:48.780
"are separated from each
other in the tree.",00:28:48.780,00:28:51.210
"And we still concluded that no
further examination of this",00:28:51.210,00:28:54.430
node makes any sense at all.,00:28:54.430,00:28:56.870
This is called deep cut off.,00:28:56.870,00:28:58.120
"And that means that this whole
branch here might as well not",00:29:05.590,00:29:08.810
"exist, and we won't have to
compute that static value.",00:29:08.810,00:29:14.150
All right?,00:29:14.150,00:29:15.530
"So, it looks--",00:29:15.530,00:29:17.950
"you have this stare of
disbelief, which",00:29:17.950,00:29:20.250
is perfectly normal.,00:29:20.250,00:29:21.660
"I have to reconvince myself
every time that",00:29:21.660,00:29:23.510
this actually works.,00:29:23.510,00:29:24.915
"But when you think your way
through it, it is clear that",00:29:24.915,00:29:28.170
"these computations that
I've x-ed out",00:29:28.170,00:29:30.660
don't have to be made.,00:29:30.660,00:29:32.120
"So, let's carry on and see if we
can complete this equal to",00:29:32.120,00:29:34.510
"or less than 8, equal
to 8, equal to 8--",00:29:34.510,00:29:39.670
"because the other branch
doesn't even exist--",00:29:39.670,00:29:42.360
equal to or less than 8.,00:29:42.360,00:29:46.760
"And we compare these two
numbers, do we keep going?",00:29:46.760,00:29:50.700
"Yes, we keep going.",00:29:50.700,00:29:52.020
"Because maybe the maximizer
can go to the right and",00:29:52.020,00:29:54.010
actually get to that 8.,00:29:54.010,00:29:56.870
"So, we have to go over here
and keep working away.",00:29:56.870,00:29:59.990
"There's a nine, equal
to or less than 9,",00:29:59.990,00:30:02.600
another 9 equal to 9.,00:30:02.600,00:30:04.790
"Push that number up equal
to or greater than 9.",00:30:04.790,00:30:08.620
"The minimizer gets an
8 going this way.",00:30:11.360,00:30:14.322
"The maximizer is insured of
getting a 9 going that way.",00:30:14.322,00:30:16.840
"So, once again, we've got
a cut off situation.",00:30:16.840,00:30:18.860
It's as if this doesn't exist.,00:30:18.860,00:30:21.392
"Those static evaluations
are not made.",00:30:21.392,00:30:24.540
"This move generation is not made
and computation is saved.",00:30:24.540,00:30:28.000
"So, let's see if we can do
better on this very example",00:30:32.010,00:30:36.200
using this alpha-beta idea.,00:30:36.200,00:30:38.342
"I'll slow it down a little bit
and change the search type to",00:30:38.342,00:30:42.150
minimax with alpha-beta.,00:30:42.150,00:30:45.110
"We see two numbers on each of
those nodes now, guess what",00:30:45.110,00:30:47.540
they're called.,00:30:47.540,00:30:48.220
We already know.,00:30:48.220,00:30:49.070
They're alpha and beta.,00:30:49.070,00:30:50.430
"So, what's going to happen is
the algorithm proceeds through",00:30:50.430,00:30:53.270
"trees that those numbers are
going to shrink wrap",00:30:53.270,00:30:55.710
"themselves around
the situation.",00:30:55.710,00:30:58.210
"So, we'll start that up.",00:30:58.210,00:30:59.460
"Two static evaluations
were not made.",00:31:04.770,00:31:08.030
Let's try a new tree.,00:31:08.030,00:31:09.280
"Two different ones
were not made.",00:31:14.240,00:31:16.496
"A new tree, still again, two
different ones not made.",00:31:16.496,00:31:25.300
"Let's see what happens when we
use the classroom example, the",00:31:25.300,00:31:29.180
one I did up there.,00:31:29.180,00:31:29.960
"Let's make sure that I
didn't screw it up.",00:31:29.960,00:31:32.900
I'll slow that down to 1.,00:31:32.900,00:31:34.480
"2, same answer.",00:31:45.150,00:31:48.280
"So, you probably didn't realize
it at the start.",00:31:48.280,00:31:50.380
Who could?,00:31:50.380,00:31:51.530
"In fact, the play goes down that
way, over this way, down",00:31:51.530,00:31:56.040
"that way, and ultimately to
the 8, which is not the",00:31:56.040,00:31:59.710
biggest number.,00:31:59.710,00:32:00.390
"And it's not the smallest
number.",00:32:00.390,00:32:01.460
"It's the compromised number
that's arrived at virtue of",00:32:01.460,00:32:03.866
"the fact that this is an
adversarial situation.",00:32:03.866,00:32:07.980
"So, you say to me, how much
energy, how much work do you",00:32:07.980,00:32:12.120
actually saved by doing this?,00:32:12.120,00:32:14.820
"Well, it is the case that in
the optimal situation, if",00:32:14.820,00:32:34.440
"everything is ordered right,
if God has come down and",00:32:34.440,00:32:37.615
"arranged your tree in just
the right way, then the",00:32:37.615,00:32:41.110
"approximate amount of work you
need to do, the approximate",00:32:41.110,00:32:44.980
"number of static evaluations
performed, is approximately",00:32:44.980,00:32:48.340
"equal to 2 times b
to the d over 2.",00:32:48.340,00:32:54.610
We don't care about this 2.,00:32:54.610,00:32:55.870
"We care a whole lot
about that 2.",00:32:55.870,00:32:59.220
"That's the amount of
work that's done.",00:32:59.220,00:33:01.760
"It's b to the d over 2,
instead of b to d.",00:33:01.760,00:33:06.050
What's that mean?,00:33:06.050,00:33:07.000
"Suppose that without
this idea, I can",00:33:07.000,00:33:09.500
go down seven levels.,00:33:09.500,00:33:12.080
"How far can I go down
with this idea?",00:33:12.080,00:33:15.280
14 levels.,00:33:15.280,00:33:17.940
"So, it's the difference
between a",00:33:17.940,00:33:18.910
jerk and a world champion.,00:33:18.910,00:33:21.340
"So, that, however, is only in
the optimal case when God has",00:33:21.340,00:33:24.880
arranged things just right.,00:33:24.880,00:33:26.710
"But in practical situations,
practical game situations, it",00:33:26.710,00:33:29.750
"appears to be the case,
experimentally, that the",00:33:29.750,00:33:32.560
"actual number is close to this
approximation for optimal",00:33:32.560,00:33:36.170
arrangements.,00:33:36.170,00:33:37.760
"So, you'd never not want
to use alpha-beta.",00:33:37.760,00:33:40.462
"It saves an amazing
amount of time.",00:33:40.462,00:33:43.870
"You could look at
it another way.",00:33:43.870,00:33:46.700
"Suppose you go down the same
number of levels, how much",00:33:46.700,00:33:50.990
less work do you have to do?,00:33:50.990,00:33:52.240
"Well, quite a bit.",00:33:55.070,00:33:55.760
"The square root [INAUDIBLE],
right?",00:33:55.760,00:33:59.050
"That's another way of looking
at how it works.",00:33:59.050,00:34:02.720
"So, we could go home at this
point except for one problem,",00:34:02.720,00:34:06.710
"and that is that we pretended
that the branching factor is",00:34:06.710,00:34:11.469
always the same.,00:34:11.469,00:34:13.560
"But, in fact, the branching
factor will vary with the game",00:34:13.560,00:34:17.909
"state and will vary
with the game.",00:34:17.909,00:34:21.510
"So, you can calculate how much
computing you can do in two",00:34:21.510,00:34:23.989
"minutes, or however much time
you have for an average move.",00:34:23.989,00:34:27.223
"And then you could say,
how deep can I go?",00:34:27.223,00:34:30.520
"And you won't know for
sure, because it",00:34:30.520,00:34:32.760
depends on the game.,00:34:32.760,00:34:35.210
"So, in the earlier days of
game-playing programs, the",00:34:35.210,00:34:39.320
"game-playing program left a
lot of computation on the",00:34:39.320,00:34:41.750
"table, because it would make a
decision in three seconds.",00:34:41.750,00:34:45.670
"And it might have made a much
different move if it used all",00:34:45.670,00:34:49.170
"the competition it
had available.",00:34:49.170,00:34:51.520
"Alternatively, it might be
grinding away, and after two",00:34:51.520,00:34:54.969
minutes was consumed.,00:34:54.969,00:34:56.880
"It had no move and just
did something random.",00:34:56.880,00:35:00.410
That's not very good.,00:35:02.920,00:35:05.020
"But that's what the early
game-playing program's did,",00:35:05.020,00:35:06.850
"because no one knew how
deep they could go.",00:35:06.850,00:35:11.980
"So, let's have a look at the
situation here and say, well,",00:35:11.980,00:35:16.910
here's a game tree.,00:35:16.910,00:35:18.670
It's a binary game tree.,00:35:18.670,00:35:20.290
That's level 0.,00:35:20.290,00:35:22.120
That's level 1.,00:35:22.120,00:35:23.890
This is level d minus 1.,00:35:23.890,00:35:26.600
And this is level d.,00:35:26.600,00:35:28.610
"So, down here you
have a situation",00:35:28.610,00:35:32.050
that looks like this.,00:35:32.050,00:35:33.380
"And I left all the game
tree out in between .",00:35:33.380,00:35:37.050
"So, how many leaf nodes
are there down here?",00:35:37.050,00:35:40.940
"b to the d, right?",00:35:40.940,00:35:42.110
"Oh, I'm going to forget about
alpha alpha-beta for a moment.",00:35:42.110,00:35:45.280
"As we did when we looked at
some of those optimal",00:35:45.280,00:35:47.760
"searches, we're going to add
these things one at a time.",00:35:47.760,00:35:50.540
"So, forget about alpha-beta,
assume we're just doing",00:35:50.540,00:35:52.550
straight minimax.,00:35:52.550,00:35:54.290
"In that case, we would have to
calculate all the static",00:35:54.290,00:35:56.970
"values down here
at the bottom.",00:35:56.970,00:35:58.610
And there are b to d of those.,00:35:58.610,00:36:03.160
"How many are there at
this next level up?",00:36:03.160,00:36:06.760
"Well, that must be b
to the d minus 1.",00:36:06.760,00:36:11.720
"How many fewer nodes are there
at the second to the last, the",00:36:11.720,00:36:14.650
"penultimate level, relative
to the final level?",00:36:14.650,00:36:19.390
"Well, 1 over b, right?",00:36:19.390,00:36:23.010
"So, if I'm concerned about not
getting all the way through",00:36:23.010,00:36:26.750
"these calculations at the d
level, I can give myself an",00:36:26.750,00:36:31.070
"insurance policy by calculating
out what the",00:36:31.070,00:36:34.320
"answer would be if I only went
down to the d minus 1th level.",00:36:34.320,00:36:40.590
"Do you get that insurance
policy?",00:36:40.590,00:36:43.540
"Let's say the branching factor
is 10, how much does that",00:36:43.540,00:36:46.510
insurance policy cost me?,00:36:46.510,00:36:48.920
10% of my competition.,00:36:48.920,00:36:51.160
"Because I can do this
calculation and have a move in",00:36:51.160,00:36:53.690
"hand here at level d minus 1 for
only 1/10 of the amount of",00:36:53.690,00:36:59.580
"the computation that's required
to figure out what I",00:36:59.580,00:37:01.730
"would do if I go all the way
down to the base level.",00:37:01.730,00:37:06.000
"OK, is that clear?",00:37:06.000,00:37:08.460
"So this idea is extremely
important in its general form.",00:37:08.460,00:37:13.160
"But we haven't quite got there
yet, because what if the",00:37:13.160,00:37:16.600
"branching factor turns out to be
really big and we can't get",00:37:16.600,00:37:19.070
through this level either?,00:37:19.070,00:37:22.130
"What should we do to
make sure that we",00:37:22.130,00:37:23.860
still have a good move?,00:37:23.860,00:37:26.215
SPEAKER 5: [INAUDIBLE].,00:37:26.215,00:37:27.610
"SPEAKER 1: Right, we can do
it at the b minus 2 level.",00:37:27.610,00:37:32.850
"So, that would be up here.",00:37:32.850,00:37:37.120
"And at that level, the amount
of computation would be b to",00:37:37.120,00:37:40.806
the d minus 2.,00:37:40.806,00:37:42.056
"So, now we've added 10%
plus 10% of that.",00:37:44.800,00:37:51.240
"And our knee jerk is begin
to form, right?",00:37:51.240,00:37:56.270
"What are we going to do in the
end to make sure that no",00:37:56.270,00:37:58.180
matter what we've got a move?,00:37:58.180,00:38:00.458
"CHRISTOPHER: Start from
the very first--",00:38:00.458,00:38:02.095
"SPEAKER 1: Correct, what's
that, Christopher?",00:38:02.095,00:38:03.280
"CHRISTOPHER: Start from
the very first level?",00:38:03.280,00:38:04.250
"SPEAKER 1: Start from the very
first level and give our self",00:38:04.250,00:38:06.515
"an insurance policy for every
level we try to calculate.",00:38:06.515,00:38:11.330
But that might be real costly.,00:38:11.330,00:38:13.780
"So, we better figure out if this
is going to be too big of",00:38:13.780,00:38:15.910
an expense to bear.,00:38:15.910,00:38:18.220
"So, let's see, if we do what
Christopher suggests, then the",00:38:18.220,00:38:22.330
"amount of computation we need
in our insurance policy is",00:38:22.330,00:38:25.860
going to be equal 1--,00:38:25.860,00:38:28.460
"we're going to do it up here at
this level, 2, even though",00:38:28.460,00:38:30.900
"we don't need it, just to make
everything work out easy.",00:38:30.900,00:38:33.560
"1 plus b, that's getting or
insurance policy down here at",00:38:33.560,00:38:37.720
this first level.,00:38:37.720,00:38:39.600
"And we're going to add b squared
all the way down to b",00:38:39.600,00:38:44.460
to d minus 1.,00:38:44.460,00:38:46.820
"That's how much we're going to
spend getting an insurance",00:38:46.820,00:38:49.280
policy at every level.,00:38:49.280,00:38:50.590
"I wished that some of that high
school algebra, right?",00:38:54.020,00:38:58.390
Let's just do it for fun.,00:38:58.390,00:39:01.812
"Oh, unfortunate choice
of variable names.",00:39:01.812,00:39:04.660
bs is equal to--,00:39:04.660,00:39:08.225
"oh, we're going to multiply
all those by b.",00:39:08.225,00:39:10.165
"Now, we'll subtract the first
one from the second one, which",00:39:17.530,00:39:29.520
"tells us that the amount of
calculation needed for our",00:39:29.520,00:39:33.330
"insurance policy is equal
to b to the d minus 1",00:39:33.330,00:39:39.720
over b minus 1.,00:39:39.720,00:39:42.070
Is that a big number?,00:39:46.450,00:39:49.580
"We could do a little algebra on
that and say that b to the",00:39:49.580,00:39:53.562
d is a huge number.,00:39:53.562,00:39:54.430
"So, that minus one
doesn't count.",00:39:54.430,00:39:57.240
And B is probably 10 to 15.,00:39:57.240,00:39:59.620
"So, b minus 1 is, essentially,
equal to b.",00:39:59.620,00:40:03.830
"So, that's approximately equal
b to the d minus 1.",00:40:03.830,00:40:08.441
"So, with an approximation
factored in, the amount of",00:40:11.150,00:40:15.340
"computation needed to do
insurance policies at every",00:40:15.340,00:40:17.140
"level is not much different from
the amount of computation",00:40:17.140,00:40:19.870
"needed to get an insurance
policy at just one level, the",00:40:19.870,00:40:22.770
penultimate one.,00:40:22.770,00:40:24.910
"So, this idea is called
progressive deepening.",00:40:24.910,00:40:27.550
"And now we can visit our gold
star idea list and see how",00:40:40.610,00:40:43.610
"these things match
up with that.",00:40:43.610,00:40:46.170
"First of all, the dead horse
principle comes to the fore",00:40:46.170,00:40:50.050
when we talk about alpha-beta.,00:40:50.050,00:40:51.530
"Because we know with alpha-beta
that we can get rid",00:40:51.530,00:40:53.570
"of a whole lot of the tree and
not do static evaluation, not",00:40:53.570,00:40:56.705
even do move generation.,00:40:56.705,00:40:59.000
"That's the dead horse we
don't want to beat.",00:40:59.000,00:41:01.120
"There's no point in doing that
calculation, because it can't",00:41:01.120,00:41:03.530
figure into the answer.,00:41:03.530,00:41:06.250
"The development of the
progressive deepening idea, I",00:41:06.250,00:41:12.830
"like to think of in terms of
the martial arts principle,",00:41:12.830,00:41:14.860
"we're using the enemy's
characteristics against them.",00:41:14.860,00:41:17.600
"Because of this exponential
blow-up, we have exactly the",00:41:17.600,00:41:20.690
"right characteristics to have
a move available at every",00:41:20.690,00:41:23.610
"level as an insurance policy
against not getting through to",00:41:23.610,00:41:26.260
the next level.,00:41:26.260,00:41:28.360
"And, finally, this whole idea
of progressive deepening can",00:41:28.360,00:41:31.910
"be viewed as a prime example
of what we like to call",00:41:31.910,00:41:34.440
"anytime algorithms that always
have an answer ready to go as",00:41:34.440,00:41:37.670
soon as an answer is demanded.,00:41:37.670,00:41:39.690
"So, as soon as that clock runs
out at two minutes, some",00:41:39.690,00:41:43.400
answer is available.,00:41:43.400,00:41:44.250
"It'll be the best one that the
system can compute in the time",00:41:44.250,00:41:47.460
"available given the
characteristics of the game",00:41:47.460,00:41:49.480
tree as it's developed so far.,00:41:49.480,00:41:51.930
"So, there are other kinds
of anytime algorithms.",00:41:51.930,00:41:53.780
This is an example of one.,00:41:53.780,00:41:56.500
"That's how all game playing
programs work, minimax, plus",00:41:56.500,00:42:01.500
"alpha-beta, plus progressive
deepening.",00:42:01.500,00:42:04.290
"Christopher, is alpha-beta
a alternative to minimax?",00:42:04.290,00:42:08.670
CHRISTOPHER: No.,00:42:08.670,00:42:09.450
"SPEAKER 1: No, it's not.",00:42:09.450,00:42:11.072
"It's something you layer
on top of minimax.",00:42:11.072,00:42:13.100
"Does alpha-beta give you a
different answer from minimax?",00:42:13.100,00:42:15.980
CHRISTOPHER: No.,00:42:18.655,00:42:20.920
"No, it doesn't.",00:42:20.920,00:42:21.600
"SPEAKER 1: Let's see everybody
shake their head",00:42:21.600,00:42:23.105
one way or the other.,00:42:23.105,00:42:24.590
"It does not give you an answer
different from minimax.",00:42:24.590,00:42:26.960
That's right.,00:42:26.960,00:42:27.770
"It gives you exactly
the same answer,",00:42:27.770,00:42:29.430
not a different answer.,00:42:29.430,00:42:30.660
It's a speed-up.,00:42:30.660,00:42:32.800
It's not an approximation.,00:42:32.800,00:42:34.570
It's a speed-up.,00:42:34.570,00:42:35.140
It cuts off lots of the tree.,00:42:35.140,00:42:36.835
"It's a dead horse principle
at work.",00:42:36.835,00:42:39.260
"You got a question,
Christopher?",00:42:39.260,00:42:40.618
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, since all
of the lines progressively",00:42:40.618,00:42:45.558
"[INAUDIBLE], is it possible to
keep a temporary value if the",00:42:45.558,00:42:50.498
"value [INAUDIBLE] each node of
the tree and then [INAUDIBLE]?",00:42:50.498,00:42:54.944
"SPEAKER 1: Oh, excellent
suggestion.",00:42:54.944,00:42:56.920
"In fact, Christopher
has just--",00:42:56.920,00:42:58.930
"I think, if I can jump ahead
a couple steps--",00:42:58.930,00:43:01.510
"Christopher has reinvented
a very important idea.",00:43:01.510,00:43:04.600
"Progressive deepening not only
ensures you have an answer at",00:43:12.250,00:43:14.295
"any time, it actually improves
the performance of alpha-beta",00:43:14.295,00:43:18.080
"when you layer alpha-beta
on top of it.",00:43:18.080,00:43:21.090
"Because these values that are
calculated at intermediate",00:43:21.090,00:43:25.050
"parts of the tree are used to
reorder the nodes under the",00:43:25.050,00:43:28.890
"tree so as to give you maximum
alpha-beta cut-off.",00:43:28.890,00:43:33.190
"I think that's what you
said, Christopher.",00:43:33.190,00:43:34.650
"But if it isn't, we'll talk
about your idea after class.",00:43:34.650,00:43:39.380
"So, this is what every game
playing program does.",00:43:39.380,00:43:42.170
How is Deep Blue different?,00:43:42.170,00:43:44.510
Not much.,00:43:44.510,00:43:45.760
"So, Deep Blue, as of 1997, did
about 200 million static",00:43:51.830,00:43:57.000
evaluations per second.,00:43:57.000,00:43:59.042
"And it went down, using
alpha-beta,",00:43:59.042,00:44:03.530
"about 14, 15, 16 levels.",00:44:03.530,00:44:08.100
"So, Deep Blue was minimax,
plus alpha-beta, plus",00:44:08.100,00:44:21.800
"progressive deepening, plus
a whole lot of parallel",00:44:21.800,00:44:27.480
"computing, plus an opening book,
plus special purpose",00:44:27.480,00:44:42.080
"stuff for the end game, plus--",00:44:42.080,00:44:47.800
"perhaps the most important
thing--",00:44:47.800,00:44:49.470
uneven tree development.,00:45:04.210,00:45:06.150
"So far, we've pretended that the
tree always goes up in an",00:45:06.150,00:45:08.880
even way to a fixed level.,00:45:08.880,00:45:10.610
"But there's no particular reason
why that has to be so.",00:45:10.610,00:45:13.310
"Some situation down at the
bottom of the tree may be",00:45:16.190,00:45:19.870
particularly dynamic.,00:45:19.870,00:45:21.920
"In the very next move, you might
be able to capture the",00:45:21.920,00:45:23.720
opponent's Queen.,00:45:23.720,00:45:25.780
"So, in circumstances like that,
you want to blow out a",00:45:25.780,00:45:27.750
little extra search.,00:45:27.750,00:45:29.600
"So, eventually, you get to
the idea that there's no",00:45:29.600,00:45:31.280
"particular reason to
have the search go",00:45:31.280,00:45:33.810
down to a fixed level.,00:45:33.810,00:45:35.880
"But, instead, you can develop
the tree in a way that gives",00:45:35.880,00:45:38.920
"you the most confidence
that your",00:45:38.920,00:45:40.800
backed-up numbers are correct.,00:45:40.800,00:45:43.330
"That's the most important of
these extra flourishes added",00:45:43.330,00:45:46.670
"by Deep Blue when it beat
Kasparov in 1997.",00:45:46.670,00:45:51.370
"And now we can come back
and say, well, you",00:45:51.370,00:45:53.890
understand Deep Blue.,00:45:53.890,00:45:54.710
"But is this a model of
anything that goes",00:45:54.710,00:45:56.430
on in our own heads?,00:45:56.430,00:45:58.950
"Is this a model of any kind
of human intelligence?",00:45:58.950,00:46:02.010
"Or is it a different kind
of intelligence?",00:46:02.010,00:46:05.210
"And the answer is
mixed, right?",00:46:05.210,00:46:06.460
"Because we are often in
situations where we are",00:46:06.460,00:46:09.950
playing a game.,00:46:09.950,00:46:11.720
"We're competing with another
manufacturer.",00:46:11.720,00:46:13.470
"We have to think what the other
manufacturer will do in",00:46:13.470,00:46:16.300
"response to what we do
down several levels.",00:46:16.300,00:46:21.500
"On the other hand, is going
down 14 levels what human",00:46:21.500,00:46:26.230
"chess players do when they win
the world championship?",00:46:26.230,00:46:29.705
"It doesn't seem, even to them,
like that's even a remote",00:46:29.705,00:46:33.620
possibility.,00:46:33.620,00:46:35.570
"They have to do something
different, because they don't",00:46:35.570,00:46:37.740
"have that kind of computational
horsepower.",00:46:37.740,00:46:41.180
"This is doing computation in the
same way that a bulldozer",00:46:41.180,00:46:45.350
processes gravel.,00:46:45.350,00:46:47.600
"It's substituting raw power
for sophistication.",00:46:47.600,00:46:51.650
"So, when a human chess master
plays the game, they have a",00:46:51.650,00:46:54.790
"great deal of chess knowledge
in their head and they",00:46:54.790,00:46:56.640
recognize patterns.,00:46:56.640,00:46:58.730
"There are famous experiments,
by the way, that demonstrate",00:46:58.730,00:47:00.910
this in the following way.,00:47:00.910,00:47:03.730
"Show a chessboard to a chess
master and ask them to",00:47:03.730,00:47:08.250
memorize it.,00:47:08.250,00:47:10.130
"They're very good at that, as
long as it's a legitimate",00:47:10.130,00:47:12.950
chessboard.,00:47:12.950,00:47:14.180
"If the pieces are placed
randomly, they're no",00:47:14.180,00:47:16.510
good at it at all.,00:47:16.510,00:47:18.380
"So, it's very clear that they've
developed a repertoire",00:47:18.380,00:47:21.502
"of chess knowledge that makes
it possible for them to",00:47:21.502,00:47:24.550
"recognize situations and play
the game much more like number",00:47:24.550,00:47:28.150
1 up there.,00:47:28.150,00:47:29.940
"So, Deep Blue is manifesting
some kind of intelligence.",00:47:29.940,00:47:33.150
But it's not our intelligence.,00:47:33.150,00:47:34.360
It's bulldozer intelligence.,00:47:34.360,00:47:36.800
"So, it's important to understand
that kind of",00:47:36.800,00:47:38.330
"intelligence, too.",00:47:38.330,00:47:40.020
"But it's not necessarily the
same kind of intelligence that",00:47:40.020,00:47:42.290
we have in our own head.,00:47:42.290,00:47:43.540
"So, that concludes what we're
going to do today.",00:47:46.160,00:47:47.570
"And, as you know, on Wednesday
we have a celebration of",00:47:47.570,00:47:49.790
"learning, which is familiar to
you if you take a 309.1.",00:47:49.790,00:47:56.940
"And, therefore, I will
see you on Wednesday,",00:47:56.940,00:48:00.440
"all of you, I imagine.",00:48:00.440,00:48:01.690
