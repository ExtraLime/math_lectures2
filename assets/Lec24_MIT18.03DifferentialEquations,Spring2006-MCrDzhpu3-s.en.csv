"For the rest of the term,
we are going to be studying not",00:00:08.000,00:00:11.677
"just one differential equation
at a time, but rather what are",00:00:11.677,00:00:15.617
"called systems of differential
equations.",00:00:15.617,00:00:18.244
"Those are like systems of
linear equations.",00:00:18.244,00:00:21.002
"They have to be solved
simultaneously,",00:00:21.002,00:00:23.432
"in other words,
not just one at a time.",00:00:23.432,00:00:25.928
"So, how does a system look when
you write it down?",00:00:25.928,00:00:30.000
"Well, since we are going to be
talking about systems of",00:00:30.000,00:00:34.196
"ordinary differential equations,
there still will be only one",00:00:34.196,00:00:38.860
"independent variable,
but there will be several",00:00:38.860,00:00:42.435
"dependent variables.
I am going to call,",00:00:42.435,00:00:45.466
"let's say two.
The dependent variables are",00:00:45.466,00:00:48.652
"going to be, I will call them x
and y, and then the first order",00:00:48.652,00:00:53.471
"system, something involving just
first derivatives,",00:00:53.471,00:00:57.357
"will look like this.
On the left-hand side ",00:00:57.357,00:01:02.242
"will be x prime,",00:01:02.242,00:01:04.702
"in other words.
On the right-hand side will be",00:01:04.702,00:01:07.958
"the dependent variables and then
also the independent variables.",00:01:07.958,00:01:12.516
"I will indicate that,
I will separate it all from the",00:01:12.516,00:01:16.279
"others by putting a semicolon
there.",00:01:16.279,00:01:18.811
"And the same way y prime,
the derivative of y with",00:01:18.811,00:01:22.863
"respect to t,
will be some other function of",00:01:22.863,00:01:25.974
"(x, y) and t.
Let's write down explicitly",00:01:25.974,00:01:30.076
"that x and y are dependent
variables.",00:01:30.076,00:01:33.000
"And what they depend upon is
the independent variable t,",00:01:37.000,00:01:41.247
"time.
A system like this is going to",00:01:41.247,00:01:43.951
"be called first order.
And we are going to consider",00:01:43.951,00:01:47.813
"basically only first-order
systems for a secret reason that",00:01:47.813,00:01:52.292
"I will explain at the end of the
period.",00:01:52.292,00:01:56.000
"This is a first-order system,
meaning that the only kind of",00:01:56.000,00:02:00.451
"derivatives that are up here are
first derivatives.",00:02:00.451,00:02:04.288
"So x prime is dx over dt 
and so on.",00:02:04.288,00:02:08.202
"Now, there is still more
terminology.",00:02:08.202,00:02:10.965
"Of course, practically all the
equations after the term",00:02:10.965,00:02:15.109
"started, virtually all the
equations we have been",00:02:15.109,00:02:18.793
"considering are linear
equations, so it must be true",00:02:18.793,00:02:22.706
"that linear systems are the best
kind.",00:02:22.706,00:02:25.546
"And, boy, they certainly are.
When are we going to call a",00:02:25.546,00:02:31.267
"system linear?
I think in the beginning you",00:02:31.267,00:02:34.795
"should learn a little
terminology before we launch in",00:02:34.795,00:02:39.162
"and actually try to start to
solve these things.",00:02:39.162,00:02:43.110
"Well, the x and y,
the dependent variables must",00:02:43.110,00:02:46.973
"occur linearly.
In other words,",00:02:46.973,00:02:49.493
"it must look like this,
ax plus by.",00:02:49.493,00:02:53.356
"Now, the t can be a mess.
And so I will throw in an extra",00:02:53.356,00:02:58.060
"function of t there.
And y prime will be some",00:02:58.060,00:03:03.511
"other linear combination of x
and y, plus some other messy",00:03:03.511,00:03:08.128
"function of t.
But even the a,",00:03:08.128,00:03:10.477
"b, c, and d are allowed to be
functions of t.",00:03:10.477,00:03:14.041
"They could be one over t cubed
or sine t",00:03:14.041,00:03:19.064
"or something like that.
So I have to distinguish those",00:03:19.064,00:03:23.357
"cases.
The case where a,",00:03:23.357,00:03:25.220
"b, c, and d are constants,
that I will call --",00:03:25.220,00:03:30.000
"Well, there are different
things you can call it.",00:03:30.000,00:03:34.864
"We will simply call it a
constant coefficient system.",00:03:34.864,00:03:40.135
"A system with coefficients
would probably be better",00:03:40.135,00:03:45.202
"English.
On the other hand,",00:03:45.202,00:03:47.837
"a, b, c, and d,
this system will still be",00:03:47.837,00:03:51.891
"called linear if these are
functions of t.",00:03:51.891,00:03:56.047
Can also be functions of t.,00:03:56.047,00:04:00.000
"So it would be a perfectly good
linear system to have x prime",00:04:05.000,00:04:08.989
"equals tx plus sine t times y
plus e to the minus t squared.",00:04:08.989,00:04:12.845
"You would never see something
like that but it is okay.",00:04:15.039,00:04:18.630
"What else do you need to know?
Well, what would a homogenous",00:04:18.630,00:04:22.553
"system be?
A homogenous system is one",00:04:22.553,00:04:24.946
"without these extra guys.
That doesn't mean there is no t",00:04:24.946,00:04:28.670
"in it.
There could be t in the a,",00:04:28.670,00:04:32.621
"b, c and d, but these terms
with no x and y in them must not",00:04:32.621,00:04:38.571
"occur.
So, a linear homogenous.",00:04:38.571,00:04:42.000
"And that is the kind we are
going to start studying first in",00:04:47.000,00:04:50.612
"the same way when we studied
higher order equations.",00:04:50.612,00:04:53.734
"We studied first homogenous.
You had to know how to solve",00:04:53.734,00:04:57.163
"those first, and then you could
learn how to solve the more",00:04:57.163,00:05:00.714
"general kind.
So linear homogenous means that",00:05:00.714,00:05:04.324
"r1 is zero and r2 is zero for
all time.",00:05:04.324,00:05:07.175
"They are identically zero.
They are not there.",00:05:07.175,00:05:10.550
"You don't see them.
Have I left anything out?",00:05:10.550,00:05:13.850
"Yes, the initial conditions.
Since that is quite general,",00:05:13.850,00:05:18.050
"let's talk about what would
initial conditions look like?",00:05:18.050,00:05:23.000
"Well, in a general way,
the reason you have to have",00:05:28.000,00:05:31.339
"initial conditions is to get
values for the arbitrary",00:05:31.339,00:05:34.813
"constants that appear in the
solution.",00:05:34.813,00:05:37.284
"The question is,
how many arbitrary constants",00:05:37.284,00:05:40.223
"are going to appear in the
solutions of these equations?",00:05:40.223,00:05:43.897
"Well, I will just give you the
answer.",00:05:43.897,00:05:46.369
"Two.
The number of arbitrary",00:05:46.369,00:05:48.172
"constants that appear is the
total order of the system.",00:05:48.172,00:05:51.779
"For example,
if this were a second",00:05:51.779,00:05:53.984
"derivative and this were a first
derivative, I would expect three",00:05:53.984,00:05:58.259
"arbitrary constants in the
system --",00:05:58.259,00:06:02.000
"-- because the total,
the sum of two and one makes",00:06:02.000,00:06:05.547
"three.
So you must have as many",00:06:05.547,00:06:07.719
"initial conditions as you have
arbitrary constants in the",00:06:07.719,00:06:11.773
"solution.
And that, of course,",00:06:11.773,00:06:13.873
"explains when we studied
second-order equations,",00:06:13.873,00:06:17.276
"we had to have two initial
conditions.",00:06:17.276,00:06:19.954
"I had to specify the initial
starting point and the initial",00:06:19.954,00:06:24.153
"velocity.
And the reason we had to have",00:06:24.153,00:06:26.904
"two conditions was because the
general solution had two",00:06:26.904,00:06:30.814
"arbitrary constants in it.
The same thing happens here but",00:06:30.814,00:06:36.329
"the answer is it is more
natural, the conditions here are",00:06:36.329,00:06:40.537
"more natural.
I don't have to specify the",00:06:40.537,00:06:43.543
"velocity.
Why not?",00:06:43.543,00:06:44.820
"Well, because an initial
condition, of course,",00:06:44.820,00:06:48.202
"would want me to say what the
starting value of x is,",00:06:48.202,00:06:52.109
"some number,
and it will also want to know",00:06:52.109,00:06:55.190
"what the starting value of y is
at that same point.",00:06:55.190,00:07:00.000
"Well, there are my two
conditions.",00:07:00.000,00:07:02.479
"And since this is going to have
two arbitrary constants in it,",00:07:02.479,00:07:07.062
"it is these initial conditions
that will satisfy,",00:07:07.062,00:07:10.668
"the arbitrary constants will
have to be picked so as to",00:07:10.668,00:07:14.725
"satisfy those initial
conditions.",00:07:14.725,00:07:17.129
"In some sense,
the giving of initial",00:07:17.129,00:07:19.759
"conditions for a system is a
more natural activity than",00:07:19.759,00:07:23.816
"giving the initial conditions of
a second order system.",00:07:23.816,00:07:29.000
"You don't have to be the least
bit cleaver about it.",00:07:29.000,00:07:32.529
"Anybody would give these two
numbers.",00:07:32.529,00:07:35.020
"Whereas, somebody faced with a
second order system might",00:07:35.020,00:07:38.825
"scratch his head.
And, in fact,",00:07:38.825,00:07:40.901
"there are other kinds of
conditions.",00:07:40.901,00:07:43.323
"There are boundary conditions
you learned a little bit about",00:07:43.323,00:07:47.406
"instead of initial conditions
for a second order equation.",00:07:47.406,00:07:51.350
"I cannot think of any more
general terminology,",00:07:51.350,00:07:54.533
"so it sounds like we are going
to actually have to get to work.",00:07:54.533,00:08:00.000
"Okay, let's get to work.
I want to set up a system and",00:08:00.000,00:08:04.035
"solve it.
And since one of the things in",00:08:04.035,00:08:07.005
"this course is supposed to be
simple modeling,",00:08:07.005,00:08:10.431
"it should be a system that
models something.",00:08:10.431,00:08:13.705
"In general, the kinds of models
we are going to use when we",00:08:13.705,00:08:18.121
"study systems are the same ones
we used in studying just",00:08:18.121,00:08:22.309
"first-order equations.
Mixing, radioactive decay,",00:08:22.309,00:08:25.964
"temperature,
the motion of temperature.",00:08:25.964,00:08:30.000
"Heat, heat conduction,
in other words.",00:08:30.000,00:08:32.838
"Diffusion.
I have given you a diffusion",00:08:32.838,00:08:35.753
"problem for your first homework
on this subject.",00:08:35.753,00:08:39.359
"What else did we do?
That's all I can think of for",00:08:39.359,00:08:43.119
"the moment, but I am sure they
will occur to me.",00:08:43.119,00:08:46.724
"When, out of those physical
ideas, are we going to get a",00:08:46.724,00:08:50.944
"system?
The answer is,",00:08:50.944,00:08:52.555
"whenever there are two of
something that there was only",00:08:52.555,00:08:56.698
"one of before.
For example,",00:08:56.698,00:08:59.728
"if I have mixing with two tanks
where the fluid goes like that.",00:08:59.728,00:09:03.489
"Say you want to have a big tank
and a little tank here and you",00:09:03.489,00:09:07.191
"want to put some stuff into the
little tank so that it will get",00:09:07.191,00:09:10.952
"mixed in the big tank without
having to climb a big ladder and",00:09:10.952,00:09:14.653
"stop and drop the stuff in.
That will require two tanks,",00:09:14.653,00:09:17.991
"the concentration of the
substance in each tank,",00:09:17.991,00:09:20.842
"therefore, that will require a
system of equations rather than",00:09:20.842,00:09:24.543
"just one.
Or, to give something closer to",00:09:24.543,00:09:28.429
"home, closer to this backboard,
anyway, suppose you have dah,",00:09:28.429,00:09:33.131
"dah, dah, don't groan,
at least not audibly,",00:09:33.131,00:09:36.501
"something that looks like that.
And next to it put an EMF",00:09:36.501,00:09:40.890
"there.
That is just a first order.",00:09:40.890,00:09:43.476
"That just leads to a single
first order equation.",00:09:43.476,00:09:47.238
"But suppose it is a two loop
circuit.",00:09:47.238,00:09:51.000
"Now I need a pair of equations.
Each of these loops gives a",00:09:58.000,00:10:02.356
"first order differential
equation, but they have to be",00:10:02.356,00:10:06.338
"solved simultaneously to find
the current or the charges on",00:10:06.338,00:10:10.694
"the condensers.
And if I want a system of three",00:10:10.694,00:10:14.150
"equations, throw in another
loop.",00:10:14.150,00:10:16.553
"Now, suppose I put in a coil
instead.",00:10:16.553,00:10:19.258
"What is this going to lead to?
This is going to give me a",00:10:19.258,00:10:23.464
"system of three equations of
which this will be first order,",00:10:23.464,00:10:27.896
"first order.
And this will be second order",00:10:27.896,00:10:32.436
"because it has a coil.
You are up to that,",00:10:32.436,00:10:35.882
"right?
You've had coils,",00:10:35.882,00:10:37.815
"inductance?
Good.",00:10:37.815,00:10:39.159
"So the whole thing is going to
count as first-order,",00:10:39.159,00:10:43.445
"first-order,
second-order.",00:10:43.445,00:10:45.546
"To find out how complicated it
is, you have to add up the",00:10:45.546,00:10:50.252
"orders.
That is one and one,",00:10:50.252,00:10:52.521
"and two.
This is really fourth-order",00:10:52.521,00:10:55.462
"stuff that we are talking about
here.",00:10:55.462,00:11:00.000
"We can expect it to be a little
complicated.",00:11:00.000,00:11:03.141
"Well, now let's take a modest
little problem.",00:11:03.141,00:11:06.356
"I am going to return to a
problem we considered earlier in",00:11:06.356,00:11:10.520
"the problem of heat conduction.
I had forgotten whether it was",00:11:10.520,00:11:14.977
"on the problem set or I did it
in class, but I am choosing it",00:11:14.977,00:11:19.360
"because it leads to something we
will be able to solve.",00:11:19.360,00:11:23.305
"And because it illustrates how
to add a little sophistication",00:11:23.305,00:11:27.689
"to something that was
unsophisticated before.",00:11:27.689,00:11:32.000
"A pot of water.
External temperature Te of t.",00:11:32.000,00:11:35.677
I am talking about the,00:11:35.677,00:11:38.414
"temperature of something.
And what I am talking about the",00:11:38.414,00:11:43.203
"temperature of will be an egg
that is cooking inside,",00:11:43.203,00:11:47.651
"but with a difference.
This egg is not homogenous",00:11:47.651,00:11:51.756
"inside.
Instead it has a white and it",00:11:51.756,00:11:54.835
"has a yolk in the middle.
In other words,",00:11:54.835,00:11:59.048
"it is a real egg and not a
phony egg.",00:11:59.048,00:12:01.563
"That is a small pot,
or it is an ostrich egg.",00:12:01.563,00:12:04.637
"[LAUGHTER] That is the yoke.
The yolk is contained in a",00:12:04.637,00:12:08.410
"little membrane inside.
And there are little yucky",00:12:08.410,00:12:11.834
"things that hold it in position.
And we are going to let the",00:12:11.834,00:12:15.956
"temperature of the yolk,
if you can see in the back of",00:12:15.956,00:12:19.659
"the room, be T1.
That is the temperature of the",00:12:19.659,00:12:22.873
"yolk.
The temperature of the white,",00:12:22.873,00:12:25.248
"which we will assume is
uniform, is going to be T2.",00:12:25.248,00:12:30.000
"Oh, that's the water bath.
The temperature of the white is",00:12:30.000,00:12:34.672
"T2, and then the temperature of
the external water bath.",00:12:34.672,00:12:39.180
"In other words,
the reason for introducing two",00:12:39.180,00:12:42.868
"variables instead of just the
one variable for the overall",00:12:42.868,00:12:47.540
"temperature of the egg we had is
because egg white is liquid pure",00:12:47.540,00:12:52.786
"protein, more or less,
and the T1, the yolk has a lot",00:12:52.786,00:12:57.049
"of fat and cholesterol and other
stuff like that which is",00:12:57.049,00:13:01.639
"supposed to be bad for you.
It certainly has different",00:13:01.639,00:13:06.503
"conducting.
It is liquid,",00:13:06.503,00:13:07.890
"at the beginning at any rate,
but it certainly has different",00:13:07.890,00:13:11.301
"constants of conductivity than
the egg white would.",00:13:11.301,00:13:14.192
"And the condition of heat
through the shell of the egg",00:13:14.192,00:13:17.256
"would be different from the
conduction of heat through the",00:13:17.256,00:13:20.552
"membrane that keeps the yoke
together.",00:13:20.552,00:13:22.691
"So it is quite reasonable to
consider that the white and the",00:13:22.691,00:13:26.102
"yolk will be at different
temperatures and will have",00:13:26.102,00:13:29.051
"different conductivity
properties.",00:13:29.051,00:13:32.000
"I am going to use Newton's laws
but with this further",00:13:32.000,00:13:36.216
"refinement.
In other words,",00:13:36.216,00:13:38.324
"introducing two temperatures.
Whereas, before we only had one",00:13:38.324,00:13:43.189
"temperature.
But let's use Newton's law.",00:13:43.189,00:13:46.351
"Let's see.
The question is how does T1,",00:13:46.351,00:13:49.432
"the temperature of the yolk,
vary with time?",00:13:49.432,00:13:52.918
"Well, the yolk is getting all
its heat from the white.",00:13:52.918,00:13:57.216
"Therefore, Newton's law of
conduction will be some constant",00:13:57.216,00:14:01.918
"of conductivity for the yolk
times T2 minus T1.",00:14:01.918,00:14:08.000
"The yolk does not know anything
about the external temperature",00:14:08.000,00:14:12.488
"of the water bath.
It is completely surrounded,",00:14:12.488,00:14:15.872
"snug and secure within itself.
But how about the temperature",00:14:15.872,00:14:20.214
"of the egg white?
That gets heat and gives heat",00:14:20.214,00:14:23.598
"to two sources,
from the external water and",00:14:23.598,00:14:26.688
"also from the internal yolk
inside.",00:14:26.688,00:14:30.000
"So you have to take into
account both of those.",00:14:30.000,00:14:33.325
"Its conduction of the heat
through that membrane,",00:14:33.325,00:14:36.795
"we will use the same a,
which is going to be a times T1",00:14:36.795,00:14:40.698
"minus T2.
Remember the order in which you",00:14:40.698,00:14:44.674
"have to write these is governed
by the yolk outside to the",00:14:44.674,00:14:48.795
"white.
Therefore, that has to come",00:14:48.795,00:14:51.180
"first when I write it in order
that a be a positive constant.",00:14:51.180,00:14:55.518
"But it is also getting heat
from the water bath.",00:14:55.518,00:15:00.000
"And, presumably,
the conductivity through the",00:15:00.000,00:15:03.423
"shell is different from what it
is through this membrane around",00:15:03.423,00:15:08.247
"the yolk.
So I am going to call that by a",00:15:08.247,00:15:11.359
"different constant.
This is the conductivity",00:15:11.359,00:15:14.704
"through the shell into the
white.",00:15:14.704,00:15:17.194
"And that is going to be T,
the external temperature minus",00:15:17.194,00:15:21.551
"the temperature of the egg
white.",00:15:21.551,00:15:24.041
"Here I have a system of
equations because I want to make",00:15:24.041,00:15:28.320
"two dependent variables by
refining the original problem.",00:15:28.320,00:15:34.000
"Now, you always have to write a
system in standard form to solve",00:15:34.000,00:15:39.667
"it.
You will see that the left-hand",00:15:39.667,00:15:42.726
"side will give the dependent
variables in a certain order.",00:15:42.726,00:15:47.854
"In this case,
the temperature of the yolk and",00:15:47.854,00:15:51.813
"then the temperature of the
white.",00:15:51.813,00:15:54.782
"The law is that in order not to
make mistakes --",00:15:54.782,00:16:00.000
"And it's a very frequent source
of error so learn from the",00:16:00.000,00:16:03.827
"beginning not to do this.
You must write the variables on",00:16:03.827,00:16:07.587
"the right-hand side in the same
order left to right in which",00:16:07.587,00:16:11.549
"they occur top to bottom here.
In other words,",00:16:11.549,00:16:14.570
"this is not a good way to leave
that.",00:16:14.570,00:16:16.988
"This is the first attempt in
writing this system,",00:16:16.988,00:16:20.211
"but the final version should
like this.",00:16:20.211,00:16:22.762
"T1 prime,
I won't bother writing dT / dt,",00:16:22.762,00:16:25.985
"is equal to --
T1 must come first,",00:16:25.985,00:16:29.888
"so minus a times T1 plus a
times T2.",00:16:29.888,00:16:34.857
"And the same law for the second
one.",00:16:34.857,00:16:38.335
"It must come in the same order.
Now, the coefficient of T1,",00:16:38.335,00:16:44.099
"that is easy.
That's a times T1.",00:16:44.099,00:16:47.180
"The coefficient of T2 is minus
a minus b,",00:16:47.180,00:16:52.248
so minus (a plus b) times T2.,00:16:52.248,00:16:56.521
"But I am not done yet.
There is still this external",00:16:56.521,00:17:02.600
"temperature I must put into the
equation.",00:17:02.600,00:17:06.315
"Now, that is not a variable.
This is some given function of",00:17:06.315,00:17:11.702
"t.
And what the function of t is,",00:17:11.702,00:17:14.674
"of course, depends upon what
the problem is.",00:17:14.674,00:17:18.668
"So that, for example,
what might be some",00:17:18.668,00:17:22.291
"possibilities,
well, suppose the problem was I",00:17:22.291,00:17:26.470
"wanted to coddle the egg.
I think there is a generation",00:17:26.470,00:17:32.349
"gap here.
How many of you know what a",00:17:32.349,00:17:35.265
"coddled egg is?
How many of you don't know?",00:17:35.265,00:17:38.667
"Well, I'm just saying my
daughter didn't know.",00:17:38.667,00:17:42.312
"I mentioned it to her.
I said I think I'm going to do",00:17:42.312,00:17:46.525
"a coddled egg tomorrow in class.
And she said what is that?",00:17:46.525,00:17:51.223
"And so I said a cuddled egg?
She said why would someone",00:17:51.223,00:17:55.597
"cuddle an egg?
I said coddle.",00:17:55.597,00:17:59.000
"And she said,
oh, you mean like a person,",00:17:59.000,00:18:02.542
"like what you do to somebody
you like or don't like or I",00:18:02.542,00:18:07.414
"don't know.
Whatever.",00:18:07.414,00:18:09.185
"I thought a while and said,
yeah, more like that.",00:18:09.185,00:18:13.437
"[LAUGHTER] Anyway,
for the enrichment of your",00:18:13.437,00:18:17.334
"cooking skills,
to coddle an egg,",00:18:17.334,00:18:20.168
"it is considered to produce a
better quality product than",00:18:20.168,00:18:25.128
"boiling an egg.
That is why people do it.",00:18:25.128,00:18:30.000
"You heat up the water to
boiling, the egg should be at",00:18:30.000,00:18:34.208
"room temperature,
and then you carefully lower",00:18:34.208,00:18:37.781
"the egg into the water.
And you turn off the heat so",00:18:37.781,00:18:41.831
"the water bath cools
exponentially while the egg",00:18:41.831,00:18:45.563
"inside is rising in temperature.
And then you wait four minutes",00:18:45.563,00:18:50.486
"or six minutes or whatever and
take it out.",00:18:50.486,00:18:53.821
"You have a perfect egg.
So for coddling,",00:18:53.821,00:18:56.918
"spelled so, what will the
external temperature be?",00:18:56.918,00:19:02.000
"Well, it starts out at time
zero at 100 degrees centigrade",00:19:02.000,00:19:06.010
"because the water is supposed to
be boiling.",00:19:06.010,00:19:09.035
"The reason you have it boiling
is for calibration so that you",00:19:09.035,00:19:13.256
"can know what temperature it is
without having to use a",00:19:13.256,00:19:17.055
"thermometer, unless you're on
Pike's Peak or some place.",00:19:17.055,00:19:20.924
"It starts out at 100 degrees.
And after that,",00:19:20.924,00:19:24.020
"since the light is off,
it cools exponential because",00:19:24.020,00:19:27.608
"that is another law.
You only have to know what K is",00:19:27.608,00:19:32.652
"for your particular pot and you
will be able to solve the",00:19:32.652,00:19:37.443
"coddled egg problem.
In other words,",00:19:37.443,00:19:40.438
"you will then be able to solve
these equations and know how the",00:19:40.438,00:19:45.743
"temperature rises.
I am going to solve a different",00:19:45.743,00:19:49.935
"problem because I don't want to
have to deal with this",00:19:49.935,00:19:54.470
"inhomogeneous term.
Let's use, as a different",00:19:54.470,00:19:58.235
"problem, a person cooks an egg.
Coddles the egg by the first",00:19:58.235,00:20:04.536
"process, decides the egg is
done, let's say hardboiled,",00:20:04.536,00:20:09.428
"and then you are supposed to
drop a hardboiled egg into cold",00:20:09.428,00:20:14.773
"water.
Not just to cool it but also",00:20:14.773,00:20:17.853
"because I think it prevents that
dark thing from forming that",00:20:17.853,00:20:23.289
"looks sort of unattractive.
Let's ice bath.",00:20:23.289,00:20:28.000
"The only reason for dropping
the egg into an ice bath is so",00:20:28.000,00:20:32.722
"that you could have a homogenous
equation to solve.",00:20:32.722,00:20:36.793
"And since this a first system
we are going to solve,",00:20:36.793,00:20:40.946
"let's make life easy for
ourselves.",00:20:40.946,00:20:43.715
"Now, all my work in preparing
this example,",00:20:43.715,00:20:47.134
"and it took considerably longer
time than actually solving the",00:20:47.134,00:20:52.101
"problem, was in picking values
for a and b which would make",00:20:52.101,00:20:56.824
"everything come out nice.
It's harder than it looks.",00:20:56.824,00:21:02.215
"The values that we are going to
use, which make no physical",00:21:02.215,00:21:07.159
"sense whatsoever,
but a equals 2 and b",00:21:07.159,00:21:11.164
"equals 3.
These are called nice numbers.",00:21:11.164,00:21:15.340
"What is the equation?
What is the system?",00:21:15.340,00:21:18.750
"Can somebody read it off for
me?",00:21:18.750,00:21:21.392
"It is T1 prime equals, what
is it, minus 2T1 plus 2T2.",00:21:21.392,00:21:26.505
That's good.,00:21:26.505,00:21:30.000
Minus 2T1 plus 2T2.,00:21:30.000,00:21:34.000
"T2 prime is,
what is it?",00:21:40.000,00:21:42.677
"I think this is 2T1.
And the other one is minus a",00:21:42.677,00:21:48.264
"plus b, so minus 5.",00:21:48.264,00:21:51.873
"This is a system.
Now, on Wednesday I will teach",00:21:51.873,00:21:57.343
"you a fancy way of solving this.
But, to be honest,",00:21:57.343,00:22:03.203
"the fancy way will take roughly
about as long as the way I am",00:22:03.203,00:22:07.213
"going to do it now.
The main reason for doing it is",00:22:07.213,00:22:10.555
"that it introduces new
vocabulary which everyone wants",00:22:10.555,00:22:14.097
"you to have.
And also, more important",00:22:14.097,00:22:16.503
"reasons, it gives more insight
into the solution than this",00:22:16.503,00:22:20.313
"method.
This method just produces the",00:22:20.313,00:22:22.719
"answer, but you want insight,
also.",00:22:22.719,00:22:24.992
"And that is just as important.
But for now,",00:22:24.992,00:22:28.853
"let's use a method which always
works and which in 40 years,",00:22:28.853,00:22:33.048
"after you have forgotten all
other fancy methods,",00:22:33.048,00:22:36.461
"will still be available to you
because it is method you can",00:22:36.461,00:22:40.584
"figure out yourself.
You don't have to remember",00:22:40.584,00:22:43.855
"anything.
The method is to eliminate one",00:22:43.855,00:22:46.628
"of the dependent variables.
It is just the way you solve",00:22:46.628,00:22:50.538
"systems of linear equations in
general if you aren't doing",00:22:50.538,00:22:54.591
"something fancy with
determinants and matrices.",00:22:54.591,00:22:59.000
"If you just eliminate
variables.",00:22:59.000,00:23:01.413
"We are going to eliminate one
of these variables.",00:23:01.413,00:23:05.149
"Let's eliminate T2.
You could also eliminate T1.",00:23:05.149,00:23:08.808
"The main thing is eliminate one
of them so you will have just",00:23:08.808,00:23:13.479
"one left to work with.
How do I eliminate T2?",00:23:13.479,00:23:16.904
"Beg your pardon?
Is something wrong?",00:23:16.904,00:23:19.628
"If somebody thinks something is
wrong raise his hand.",00:23:19.628,00:23:23.676
No?,00:23:23.676,00:23:25.000
"Why do I want to get rid of T1?
Well, I can add them.",00:23:30.000,00:23:33.229
"But, on the left-hand side,
I will have T1 prime plus T2",00:23:33.229,00:23:36.645
prime. What good is that?,00:23:36.645,00:23:39.006
[LAUGHTER],00:23:39.006,00:23:40.000
"I think you will want to do it
my way.",00:23:48.000,00:23:49.510
[APPLAUSE],00:23:49.510,00:23:50.000
"Solve for T2 in terms of T1.
That is going to be T1 prime",00:24:03.000,00:24:08.577
plus 2T1 divided by 2.,00:24:08.577,00:24:12.661
"Now, take that and substitute
it into the second equation.",00:24:12.661,00:24:18.338
"Wherever you see a T2,
put that in,",00:24:18.338,00:24:21.725
"and what you will be left with
is something just in T1.",00:24:21.725,00:24:28.000
"To be honest,
I don't know any other good way",00:24:28.000,00:24:31.450
"of doing this.
There is a fancy method that I",00:24:31.450,00:24:34.901
"think is talked about in your
book, which leads to extraneous",00:24:34.901,00:24:39.607
"solutions and so on,
but you don't want to know",00:24:39.607,00:24:43.215
"about that.
This will work for a simple",00:24:43.215,00:24:46.196
"linear equation with constant
coefficients,",00:24:46.196,00:24:49.490
"always.
Substitute in.",00:24:49.490,00:24:51.137
"What do I do?
Now, here I do not advise doing",00:24:51.137,00:24:54.588
"this mentally.
It is just too easy to make a",00:24:54.588,00:24:57.960
"mistake.
Here, I will do it carefully,",00:24:57.960,00:25:04.349
"writing everything out just as
you would.",00:25:04.349,00:25:10.349
"T1 prime plus 2T1 over 2,
prime, equals 2T1 minus 5 time",00:25:10.349,00:25:18.599
T1 prime plus 2T1 over two.,00:25:18.599,00:25:27.299
I took that and substituted,00:25:27.299,00:25:32.977
"into this equation.
Now, I don't like those two's.",00:25:32.977,00:25:38.382
"Let's get rid of them by
multiplying.",00:25:38.382,00:25:42.352
This will become 4.,00:25:42.352,00:25:45.000
"And now write this out.
What is this when you look at",00:25:52.000,00:25:57.032
"it?
This is an equation just in T1.",00:25:57.032,00:26:00.322
"It has constant coefficients.
And what is its order?",00:26:00.322,00:26:05.258
"Its order is two because T1
prime primed.",00:26:05.258,00:26:10.193
"In other words,
I can eliminate T2 okay,",00:26:10.193,00:26:13.967
"but the equation I am going to
get is no longer a first-order.",00:26:13.967,00:26:19.870
"It becomes a second-order
differential equation.",00:26:19.870,00:26:24.419
"And that's a basic law.
Even if you have a system of",00:26:24.419,00:26:30.133
"more equations,
three or four or whatever,",00:26:30.133,00:26:33.257
"the law is that after you do
the elimination successfully and",00:26:33.257,00:26:37.828
"end up with a single equation,
normally the order of that",00:26:37.828,00:26:42.095
"equation will be the sum of the
orders of the things you started",00:26:42.095,00:26:46.895
"with.
So two first-order equations",00:26:46.895,00:26:49.409
"will always produce a
second-order equation in just",00:26:49.409,00:26:53.219
"one dependent variable,
three will produce a third",00:26:53.219,00:26:56.952
"order equation and so on.
So you trade one complexity for",00:26:56.952,00:27:02.325
"another.
You trade the complexity of",00:27:02.325,00:27:04.950
"having to deal with two
equations simultaneously instead",00:27:04.950,00:27:09.075
"of just one for the complexity
of having to deal with a single",00:27:09.075,00:27:13.650
"higher order equation which is
more trouble to solve.",00:27:13.650,00:27:17.549
"It is like all mathematical
problems.",00:27:17.549,00:27:20.250
"Unless you are very lucky,
if you push them down one way,",00:27:20.250,00:27:24.450
"they are really simple now,
they just pop up some place",00:27:24.450,00:27:28.500
"else.
You say, oh,",00:27:28.500,00:27:30.812
"I didn't save anything after
all.",00:27:30.812,00:27:32.979
"That is the law of conservation
of mathematical difficulty.",00:27:32.979,00:27:36.907
"[LAUGHTER] You saw that even
with the Laplace transform.",00:27:36.907,00:27:40.632
"In the beginning it looks
great, you've got these tables,",00:27:40.632,00:27:44.424
"take the equation,
horrible to solve.",00:27:44.424,00:27:46.862
"Take some transform,
trivial to solve for capital Y.",00:27:46.862,00:27:50.316
"Now I have to find the inverse
Laplace transform.",00:27:50.316,00:27:53.566
"And suddenly all the work is
there, partial fractions,",00:27:53.566,00:27:57.155
"funny formulas and so on.
It is very hard in mathematics",00:27:57.155,00:28:02.173
"to get away with something.
It happens now and then and",00:28:02.173,00:28:06.086
"everybody cheers.
Let's write this out now in the",00:28:06.086,00:28:09.565
"form in which it looks like an
equation we can actually solve.",00:28:09.565,00:28:13.985
"Just be careful.
Now it is all right to use the",00:28:13.985,00:28:17.318
"method by which you collect
terms.",00:28:17.318,00:28:19.710
"There is only one term
involving T1 double prime.",00:28:19.710,00:28:23.188
"It's the one that comes from
here.",00:28:23.188,00:28:25.579
"How about the terms in T1
prime?",00:28:25.579,00:28:27.826
"There is a 2.
Here, there is minus 5 T1",00:28:27.826,00:28:33.137
"prime.
If I put it on the other side",00:28:33.137,00:28:37.529
"it makes plus 5 T1 prime plus
this two makes 7 T1 prime.",00:28:37.529,00:28:44.431
"And how many T1's are there?
Well, none on the left-hand",00:28:44.431,00:28:51.333
"side.
On the right-hand side I have 4",00:28:51.333,00:28:55.850
"here minus 10.
4 minus 10 is negative 6.",00:28:55.850,00:29:02.000
"Negative 6 T1 put on this
left-hand side the way we want",00:29:02.000,00:29:06.873
to do makes plus 6 T1.,00:29:06.873,00:29:09.000
"There are no inhomogeneous
terms, so that is equal to zero.",00:29:15.000,00:29:18.866
"If I had gotten a negative
number for one of these",00:29:18.866,00:29:22.133
"coefficients,
I would instantly know if I had",00:29:22.133,00:29:25.066
"made a mistake.
Why?",00:29:25.066,00:29:26.333
"Why must those numbers come out
to be positive?",00:29:26.333,00:29:30.000
"It is because the system must
be, the system must be,",00:29:30.000,00:29:33.939
"fill in with one word,
stable.",00:29:33.939,00:29:36.136
"And why must this system be
stable?",00:29:36.136,00:29:38.712
"In other words,
the long-term solutions must be",00:29:38.712,00:29:42.196
"zero, must all go to zero,
whatever they are.",00:29:42.196,00:29:45.530
"Why is that?
Well, because you are putting",00:29:45.530,00:29:48.636
"the egg into an ice bath.
Or, because we know it was",00:29:48.636,00:29:52.500
"living but after being
hardboiled it is dead and,",00:29:52.500,00:29:56.136
"therefore, dead systems are
stable.",00:29:56.136,00:30:00.000
"That's not a good reason but it
is, so to speak,",00:30:00.000,00:30:03.226
"the real one.
It's clear anyway that all",00:30:03.226,00:30:05.903
"solutions must tend to zero
physically.",00:30:05.903,00:30:08.512
"That's obvious.
And, therefore,",00:30:08.512,00:30:10.572
"the differential equation must
have the same property,",00:30:10.572,00:30:14.210
"and that means that its
coefficients must be positive.",00:30:14.210,00:30:17.848
"All its coefficients must be
positive.",00:30:17.848,00:30:20.389
"If this weren't there,
I would get oscillating",00:30:20.389,00:30:23.478
"solutions, which wouldn't go to
zero.",00:30:23.478,00:30:25.949
"That is physical impossible for
this egg.",00:30:25.949,00:30:30.000
"Now the rest is just solving.
The characteristic equation,",00:30:30.000,00:30:34.993
"if you can remember way,
way back in prehistoric times",00:30:34.993,00:30:39.637
"when we were solving these
equations, is this.",00:30:39.637,00:30:43.580
"And what you want to do is
factor it.",00:30:43.580,00:30:46.734
"This is where all the work was,
getting those numbers so that",00:30:46.734,00:30:51.990
"this would factor. So it's
r plus 1 times r plus 6",00:30:51.990,00:30:56.283
"And so the solutions are,
the roots are r equals ",00:31:04.000,00:31:07.760
"negative 1.
I am just making marks on the",00:31:07.760,00:31:10.580
"board, but you have done this
often enough,",00:31:10.580,00:31:13.400
"you know what I am talking
about.",00:31:13.400,00:31:15.549
"So the characteristic roots are
those two numbers.",00:31:15.549,00:31:18.839
"And, therefore,
the solution is,",00:31:18.839,00:31:20.920
"I could write down immediately
with its arbitrary constant as",00:31:20.920,00:31:24.949
"c1 times e to the negative t
plus c2 times e to the negative",00:31:24.949,00:31:28.911
"6t. Now, I have got to get T2.",00:31:28.911,00:31:34.284
"Here the first worry is T2 is
going to give me two more",00:31:34.284,00:31:39.030
"arbitrary constants.
It better not.",00:31:39.030,00:31:42.018
"The system is only allowed to
have two arbitrary constants in",00:31:42.018,00:31:47.290
"its solution because that is the
initial conditions we are giving",00:31:47.290,00:31:52.915
"it.
By the way, I forgot to give",00:31:52.915,00:31:55.639
"initial conditions.
Let's give initial conditions.",00:31:55.639,00:32:01.000
"Let's say the initial
temperature of the yolk,",00:32:01.000,00:32:05.020
"when it is put in the ice bath,
is 40 degrees centigrade,",00:32:05.020,00:32:10.023
"Celsius.
And T2, let's say the white",00:32:10.023,00:32:13.149
"ought to be a little hotter than
the yolk is always cooler than",00:32:13.149,00:32:18.688
"the white for a soft boiled egg,
I don't know,",00:32:18.688,00:32:22.708
"or a hardboiled egg if it
hasn't been chilled too long.",00:32:22.708,00:32:27.533
"Let's make this 45.
Realistic numbers.",00:32:27.533,00:32:32.000
"Now, the thing not to do is to
say, hey, I found T1.",00:32:32.000,00:32:35.952
"Okay, I will find T2 by the
same procedure.",00:32:35.952,00:32:39.207
"I will go through the whole
thing.",00:32:39.207,00:32:41.765
"I will eliminate T1 instead.
Then I will end up with an",00:32:41.765,00:32:45.950
"equation T2 and I will solve
that and get T2 equals blah,",00:32:45.950,00:32:50.289
"blah, blah.
That is no good,",00:32:50.289,00:32:52.382
"A, because you are working too
hard and, B, because you are",00:32:52.382,00:32:56.877
"going to get two more arbitrary
constants unrelated to these",00:32:56.877,00:33:01.450
"two.
And that is no good.",00:33:01.450,00:33:04.602
"Because the correct solution
only has two constants in it.",00:33:04.602,00:33:09.169
"Not four.
So that procedure is wrong.",00:33:09.169,00:33:12.053
"You must calculate T2 from the
T1 that you found,",00:33:12.053,00:33:15.899
"and that is the equation which
does it.",00:33:15.899,00:33:18.943
"That's the one we have to have.
Where is the chalk?",00:33:18.943,00:33:22.949
"Yes.
Maybe I can have a little thing",00:33:22.949,00:33:25.753
"so I can just carry this around
with me.",00:33:25.753,00:33:30.000
"That is the relation between T2
and T1.",00:33:37.000,00:33:40.055
"Or, if you don't like it,
either one of these equations",00:33:40.055,00:33:44.398
"will express T2 in terms of T1
for you.",00:33:44.398,00:33:47.454
"It doesn't matter.
Whichever one you use,",00:33:47.454,00:33:50.671
"however you do it,
that's the way you must",00:33:50.671,00:33:53.968
"calculate T2.
So what is it?",00:33:53.968,00:33:56.139
"T2 is calculated from that pink
box.",00:33:56.139,00:34:00.000
"It is one-half of T1 prime plus
T1.",00:34:00.000,00:34:05.350
"Now, if I take the derivative
of this, I get minus c1 times",00:34:05.350,00:34:11.436
"the exponential.
The coefficient is minus c1,",00:34:11.436,00:34:16.052
"take half of that,
that is minus a half c1",00:34:16.052,00:34:21.088
"and add it to T1.
Minus one-half c1 plus c1 gives",00:34:21.088,00:34:26.649
me one-half c1.,00:34:26.649,00:34:32.000
"And here I take the derivative,
it is minus 6 c2.",00:34:32.000,00:34:38.291
"Take half of that,
minus 3 c2 and add this c2 to",00:34:38.291,00:34:44.451
"it, minus 3 plus 1 makes minus
2.",00:34:44.451,00:34:48.645
"That is T2.
And notice it uses the same",00:34:48.645,00:34:53.626
"arbitrary constants that T1
uses.",00:34:53.626,00:34:59.000
"So we end up with just two
because we calculated T2 from",00:34:59.000,00:35:02.544
"that formula or from the
equation which is equivalent to",00:35:02.544,00:35:06.089
"it, not from scratch.
We haven't put in the initial",00:35:06.089,00:35:09.312
"conditions yet,
but that is easy to do.",00:35:09.312,00:35:11.761
"Everybody, when working with
exponentials,",00:35:11.761,00:35:14.404
"of course, you always want the
initial conditions to be when T",00:35:14.404,00:35:18.335
"is equal to zero
because that makes all the",00:35:18.335,00:35:21.687
"exponentials one and you don't
have to worry about them.",00:35:21.687,00:35:25.232
"But this you know.
If I put in the initial",00:35:25.232,00:35:27.875
"conditions, at time zero,
T1 has the value 40.",00:35:27.875,00:35:32.000
"So 40 should be equal to c1 +
c2.",00:35:32.000,00:35:38.024
"And the other equation will say
that 45 is equal to one-half c1",00:35:38.024,00:35:45.647
"minus 2 c2. 
Now we are supposed to",00:35:45.647,00:35:52.409
"solve these.
Well, this is called solving",00:35:52.409,00:35:57.327
"simultaneous linear equations.
We could use Kramer's rule,",00:35:57.327,00:36:05.308
"inverse matrices,
but why don't we just",00:36:05.308,00:36:09.964
"eliminate.
Let me see.",00:36:09.964,00:36:12.537
"If I multiply by,
45, so multiply by two,",00:36:12.537,00:36:17.438
"you get 90 equals c1 
minus 4 c2.",00:36:17.438,00:36:23.565
"Then subtract this guy from
that guy.",00:36:23.565,00:36:27.976
"So, 40 taken from 90 makes 50.
And c1 taken from c1,",00:36:27.976,00:36:35.503
"because I multiplied by two,
makes zero.",00:36:35.503,00:36:40.153
"And c2 taken from minus 4 c2,
that makes minus 5 c2,",00:36:40.153,00:36:47.307
I guess.,00:36:47.307,00:36:49.811
"I seem to get c2 is equal to
negative 10.",00:36:49.811,00:36:56.130
"And if c2 is negative 10,
then c1 must be 50.",00:36:56.130,00:37:04.000
"There are two ways of checking
the answer.",00:37:04.000,00:37:07.919
"One is to plug it into the
equations, and the other is to",00:37:07.919,00:37:13.272
"peak.
Yes, that's right.",00:37:13.272,00:37:15.470
[LAUGHTER],00:37:15.470,00:37:17.000
"The final answer is,
in other words,",00:37:25.000,00:37:27.517
"you put a 50 here,
25 there, negative 10 here,",00:37:27.517,00:37:30.755
"and positive 20 there.
That gives the answer to the",00:37:30.755,00:37:34.352
"problem.
It tells you,",00:37:34.352,00:37:35.863
"in other words,
how the temperature of the yolk",00:37:35.863,00:37:39.172
"varies with time and how the
temperature of the white varies",00:37:39.172,00:37:43.417
"with time.
As I said, we are going to",00:37:43.417,00:37:46.879
"learn a slick way of doing this
problem, or at least a very",00:37:46.879,00:37:51.072
"different way of doing the same
problem next time,",00:37:51.072,00:37:54.614
"but let's put that on ice for
the moment.",00:37:54.614,00:37:57.506
"And instead I would like to
spend the rest of the period",00:37:57.506,00:38:01.481
"doing for first order systems
the same thing that I did for",00:38:01.481,00:38:05.674
"you the very first day of the
term.",00:38:05.674,00:38:09.000
"Remember, I walked in assuming
that you knew how to separate",00:38:09.000,00:38:13.145
"variables the first day of the
term, and I did not talk to you",00:38:13.145,00:38:17.432
"about how to solve fancier
equations by fancier methods.",00:38:17.432,00:38:21.297
"I instead talked to you about
the geometric significance,",00:38:21.297,00:38:25.232
"what the geometric meaning of a
single first order equation was",00:38:25.232,00:38:29.589
"and how that geometric meaning
enabled you to solve it",00:38:29.589,00:38:33.313
"numerically.
And we spent a little while",00:38:33.313,00:38:36.654
"working on such problems because
nowadays with computers it is",00:38:36.654,00:38:40.393
"really important that you get a
feeling for what these things",00:38:40.393,00:38:44.070
"mean as opposed to just
algorithms for solving them.",00:38:44.070,00:38:47.196
"As I say, most differential
equations, especially systems,",00:38:47.196,00:38:50.690
"are likely to be solved by a
computer anyway.",00:38:50.690,00:38:54.000
"You have to be the guiding
genius that interprets the",00:38:54.000,00:38:57.978
"answers and can see when
mistakes are being made,",00:38:57.978,00:39:01.650
"stuff like that.
The problem is,",00:39:01.650,00:39:04.021
"therefore, what is the meaning
of this system?",00:39:04.021,00:39:08.000
"Well, you are not going to get
anywhere interpreting it",00:39:15.000,00:39:18.739
"geometrically,
unless you get rid of that t on",00:39:18.739,00:39:21.855
"the right-hand side.
And the only way of getting rid",00:39:21.855,00:39:25.387
"of the t is to declare it is not
there.",00:39:25.387,00:39:28.019
"So I hereby declare that I will
only consider,",00:39:28.019,00:39:31.135

explicitly on the right-hand",00:39:34.736,00:39:38.684
"side.
Because I don't know what to do",00:39:38.684,00:39:42.375
"if it does up here.
We have a word for these.",00:39:42.375,00:39:45.747
"Remember what the first order
word was?",00:39:45.747,00:39:48.659
"A first order equation where
there was no t explicitly on the",00:39:48.659,00:39:53.256
"right-hand side,
we called it,",00:39:53.256,00:39:55.478
"anybody remember?
Just curious.",00:39:55.478,00:39:57.777
"Autonomous, right.",00:39:57.777,00:40:00.000
"This is an autonomous system.
It is not a linear system",00:40:05.000,00:40:08.591
"because these are messy
functions.",00:40:08.591,00:40:10.785
"This could be x times y
or x squared minus 3y squared",00:40:10.785,00:40:14.709
divided by sine of x plus y.,00:40:14.709,00:40:18.500
"It could be a mess.
Definitely not linear.",00:40:18.500,00:40:21.226
"But autonomous means no t.
t means the independent",00:40:21.226,00:40:24.485
"variable appears on the
right-hand side.",00:40:24.485,00:40:27.078
"Of course, it is there.
It is buried in the dx/dt and",00:40:27.078,00:40:30.536
"dy/dt.
But it is not on the right-hand",00:40:30.536,00:40:33.675
"side.
No t appears on the right-hand",00:40:33.675,00:40:35.567
side.,00:40:35.567,00:40:36.000
"Because no t appears on the
right-hand side,",00:40:41.000,00:40:44.984
"I can now draw a picture of
this.",00:40:44.984,00:40:47.949
"But, let's see,
what does a solution look like?",00:40:47.949,00:40:52.212
"I never even talked about what
a solution was,",00:40:52.212,00:40:56.382
"did I?
Well, pretend that immediately",00:40:56.382,00:40:59.718
"after I talked about that,
I talked about this.",00:40:59.718,00:41:05.000
"What is the solution?
Well, the solution,",00:41:05.000,00:41:07.437
"maybe you took it for granted,
is a pair of functions,",00:41:07.437,00:41:10.666
"x of t, y of t if when 
you plug it in",00:41:10.666,00:41:13.896
"it satisfies the equation.
And so what else is new?",00:41:13.896,00:41:16.942
"The solution is x 
equals x of t,",00:41:16.942,00:41:19.623
y equals y of t.,00:41:19.623,00:41:22.000
"If I draw a picture of that
what would it look like?",00:41:27.000,00:41:30.975
"This is where your previous
knowledge of physics above all",00:41:30.975,00:41:35.418
"18.02, maybe 18.01 if you
learned this in high school,",00:41:35.418,00:41:39.550
"what is x equals x of t and 
y equals y of t?",00:41:39.550,00:41:44.305
How do you draw a picture of,00:41:44.305,00:41:47.033
"that?
What does it represent?",00:41:47.033,00:41:49.216
"A curve.
And what will be the title of",00:41:49.216,00:41:52.100
"the chapter of the calculus book
in which that is discussed?",00:41:52.100,00:41:56.699
"Parametric equations.
This is a parameterized curve.",00:41:56.699,00:42:02.000
"So we know what the solution
looks like.",00:42:12.000,00:42:15.174
"Our solution is a parameterized
curve.",00:42:15.174,00:42:18.186
"And what does a parameterized
curve look like?",00:42:18.186,00:42:21.848
"Well, it travels,
and in a certain direction.",00:42:21.848,00:42:26.000
"Okay.
That's enough.",00:42:34.000,00:42:35.360
"Why do I have several of those
curves?",00:42:35.360,00:42:38.011
"Well, because I have several
solutions.",00:42:38.011,00:42:40.732
"In fact, given any initial
starting point,",00:42:40.732,00:42:43.669
"there is a solution that goes
through it.",00:42:43.669,00:42:46.534
"I will put in possible starting
points.",00:42:46.534,00:42:49.256
"And you can do this on the
computer screen with a little",00:42:49.256,00:42:53.195
"program you will have,
one of the visuals you'll have.",00:42:53.195,00:42:56.991
"It's being made right now.
You put down starter point,",00:42:56.991,00:43:01.826
"put down a click,
and then it just draws the",00:43:01.826,00:43:04.734
"curve passing through that
point.",00:43:04.734,00:43:06.898
"Didn't we do this early in the
term?",00:43:06.898,00:43:09.265
"Yes.
But there is a difference now",00:43:09.265,00:43:11.497
"which I will explain.
These are various possible",00:43:11.497,00:43:14.676
"starting points at time zero for
this solution,",00:43:14.676,00:43:17.787
"and then you see what happens
to it afterwards.",00:43:17.787,00:43:20.898
"In fact, through every point in
the plane will pass a solution",00:43:20.898,00:43:25.024
"curve, parameterized curve.
Now, what is then the",00:43:25.024,00:43:29.344
"representation of this?
Well, what is the meaning of x",00:43:29.344,00:43:32.735
prime of t and y prime of t?,00:43:32.735,00:43:36.000
"I am not going to worry for the
moment about the right-hand",00:43:40.000,00:43:44.500
"side.
What does this mean by itself?",00:43:44.500,00:43:47.215
"If this is the curve,
the parameterized motion,",00:43:47.215,00:43:50.784
"then this represents its
velocity vector.",00:43:50.784,00:43:53.887
"It is the velocity of the
solution at time t.",00:43:53.887,00:43:58.000
"If I think of the solution as
being a parameterized motion.",00:43:58.000,00:44:03.002
"All I have drawn here is the
trace, the path of the motion.",00:44:03.002,00:44:08.005
"This hasn't indicated how fast
it was going.",00:44:08.005,00:44:11.714
"One solution might go whoosh
and another one might go rah.",00:44:11.714,00:44:16.630
"That is a velocity,
and that velocity changes from",00:44:16.630,00:44:20.857
"point to point.
It changes direction.",00:44:20.857,00:44:23.962
"Well, we know its direction at
each point.",00:44:23.962,00:44:27.498
"That's tangent.
What I cannot tell is the",00:44:27.498,00:44:31.953
"speed.
From this picture,",00:44:31.953,00:44:33.828
"I cannot tell what the speed
was.",00:44:33.828,00:44:36.328
"Too bad.
Now, what is then the meaning",00:44:36.328,00:44:39.218
"of the system?
What the system does,",00:44:39.218,00:44:41.953
"it prescribes at each point the
velocity vector.",00:44:41.953,00:44:45.625
"If you tell me what the point
(x, y) is in the plane then",00:44:45.625,00:44:50.000
"these equations give you the
velocity vector at that point.",00:44:50.000,00:44:54.531
"And, therefore,
what I end up with,",00:44:54.531,00:44:57.187
"the system is what you call in
physics and what you call in",00:44:57.187,00:45:01.718
"18.02 a velocity field.
So at each point there is a",00:45:01.718,00:45:06.788
"certain vector.
The vector is always tangent to",00:45:06.788,00:45:09.835
"the solution curve through
there, but I cannot predict from",00:45:09.835,00:45:13.678
"just this picture what its
length will be because at some",00:45:13.678,00:45:17.388
"points, it might be going slow.
The solution might be going",00:45:17.388,00:45:21.230
"slowly.
In other words,",00:45:21.230,00:45:22.687
"the plane is filled up with
these guys.",00:45:22.687,00:45:26.000
"Stop me.
Not enough here.",00:45:33.000,00:45:37.208
"So on and so on.
We can say a system of first",00:45:37.208,00:45:44.924
"order equations,
ODEs of first order equations,",00:45:44.924,00:45:52.990
"autonomous because there must
be no t on the right-hand side,",00:45:52.990,00:46:03.511
"is equal to a velocity field.
A field of velocity.",00:46:03.511,00:46:12.919
"The plane covered with velocity
vectors.",00:46:12.919,00:46:18.613
"And a solution is a
parameterized curve with the",00:46:18.613,00:46:25.474
right velocity everywhere.,00:46:25.474,00:46:30.000
"Now, there obviously must be a
connection between that and the",00:46:38.000,00:47:39.620
"direction fields we studied at
the beginning of the term.",00:47:39.620,00:48:36.189
"And there is.
It is a very important",00:48:36.189,00:49:11.545
"connection.
It is too important to talk",00:49:11.545,00:49:49.932
"about in minus one minute.
When we need it,",00:49:49.932,00:50:32.359
"I will have to spend some time
talking about it then.",00:50:32.359,00:50:35.825
