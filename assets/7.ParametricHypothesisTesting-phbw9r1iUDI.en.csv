So welcome back.,00:00:21.590,00:00:23.240
"So we are now moving
to a new chapter, which",00:00:23.240,00:00:26.180
"is going to have a little
more of a statistical flavor",00:00:26.180,00:00:30.050
"when it comes to designing
methods, all right?",00:00:30.050,00:00:32.720
"Because if you
think about it, OK--",00:00:32.720,00:00:35.090
"some of you have probably
attempted problem number two",00:00:35.090,00:00:39.139
in the problem set.,00:00:39.139,00:00:39.930
"And you realize that maximum
likelihood estimators does not",00:00:39.930,00:00:44.360
"give you super trivial
estimators, right?",00:00:44.360,00:00:48.080
"I mean, when you have an n theta
theta, then the thing you get",00:00:48.080,00:00:50.752
"is not something you could have
guessed before you actually",00:00:50.752,00:00:53.210
attempted to solve that problem.,00:00:53.210,00:00:55.410
"And so, in a way, we've seen
already sophisticated methods.",00:00:55.410,00:00:59.270
"However, in many instances, the
maximum likelihood estimator",00:00:59.270,00:01:02.630
was just an average.,00:01:02.630,00:01:03.710
"And in a way, even if
we had this confirmation",00:01:03.710,00:01:07.010
"for maximum likelihood that
indeed that was the estimator",00:01:07.010,00:01:09.950
"that maximum likelihood
would spit out,",00:01:09.950,00:01:11.960
"and that our intuition
was therefore pretty good,",00:01:11.960,00:01:15.780
"most of the statistical analysis
or use of the central limit",00:01:15.780,00:01:18.560
"theorems, all these
things actually",00:01:18.560,00:01:20.390
"did not come in the
building of estimator,",00:01:20.390,00:01:23.780
"in the design of the
estimator, but really",00:01:23.780,00:01:25.700
"in the analysis
of the estimator.",00:01:25.700,00:01:27.365
"And you could say,
well, if I know already",00:01:27.365,00:01:29.955
"that the best estimator
is the average,",00:01:29.955,00:01:31.580
"I'm just going to
use the average.",00:01:31.580,00:01:32.996
"I don't have to, basically,
quantify how good it is.",00:01:32.996,00:01:35.450
"I just know it's
the best I can do.",00:01:35.450,00:01:37.760
We're going to talk about tests.,00:01:37.760,00:01:39.290
"And we're going to talk about
parametric hypothesis testing.",00:01:39.290,00:01:44.460
"So you should view this
as-- parametric means,",00:01:44.460,00:01:46.880
"well, it's about a parameter,
like we did before.",00:01:46.880,00:01:49.420
"And hypothesis testing is on
the same level as estimation.",00:01:49.420,00:01:54.420
"And on the same
level as estimator",00:01:54.420,00:01:56.510
"will be the word ""test,"" OK?",00:01:56.510,00:01:58.760
"And when we're going
to devise a test,",00:01:58.760,00:02:01.100
"we're going to actually
need to understand",00:02:01.100,00:02:03.200
"random fluctuations that arise
from the central limit theorem",00:02:03.200,00:02:06.090
"better, OK?",00:02:06.090,00:02:06.860
"It's not just going
to be in the analysis.",00:02:06.860,00:02:08.940
"It's also going to
be in the design.",00:02:08.940,00:02:10.610
"And everything we've been
doing before in understanding",00:02:10.610,00:02:12.901
"the behavior of an
estimator is actually",00:02:12.901,00:02:14.720
"going to come in
and be extremely",00:02:14.720,00:02:16.910
"useful in the actual
design of tests, OK?",00:02:16.910,00:02:21.820
"So as an example, I want to talk
to you about some real data.",00:02:21.820,00:02:25.120
I will not study this data.,00:02:28.080,00:02:29.690
But this data actually exist.,00:02:29.690,00:02:31.420
"You can find it
on R. And so, it's",00:02:31.420,00:02:34.330
"the data from the so-called
credit union Cherry Blossom",00:02:34.330,00:02:37.450
"Run, which is a 10 mile race.",00:02:37.450,00:02:38.890
"It takes place
every year in D.C.",00:02:38.890,00:02:40.550
"It seems that some of the
years are pretty nice.",00:02:40.550,00:02:42.550
"In 2009, there were about
15,000 participants.",00:02:42.550,00:02:45.820
Pretty big race.,00:02:45.820,00:02:47.290
"And the average running time
was 103.5 minutes, all right?",00:02:47.290,00:02:52.330
"So about an hour and a
half or a little bit more.",00:02:52.330,00:02:57.710
"And so, you can ask the
following question, right?",00:02:57.710,00:03:01.240
"This is actual data, right?",00:03:01.240,00:03:02.580
"103.5 actually averaged the
running time for all of 15,000.",00:03:02.580,00:03:07.330
"Now, this in practice, may not
be something very suitable.",00:03:07.330,00:03:10.630
"And you might want to
just sample a few runners",00:03:10.630,00:03:13.330
"and try to understand
how they're",00:03:13.330,00:03:15.130
"behaving every
year without having",00:03:15.130,00:03:16.900
to collect the entire data set.,00:03:16.900,00:03:18.910
"And so, you could ask
the question, well,",00:03:18.910,00:03:20.710
"let's say my budget is to
ask for maybe 10 runners",00:03:20.710,00:03:24.160
what their running time was.,00:03:24.160,00:03:25.960
"I still want to be
able to determine",00:03:25.960,00:03:27.760
"whether they were running
faster in 2012 than in 2009.",00:03:27.760,00:03:31.600
"Why do I put 2012, and not 2016?",00:03:31.600,00:03:34.420
"Well, because the data set
for 2012 is also available.",00:03:34.420,00:03:38.860
"So if you are interested
and you know how to use R,",00:03:38.860,00:03:41.770
just go and have fun with it.,00:03:41.770,00:03:44.300
"So to answer this question, what
we do is we select n runners,",00:03:44.300,00:03:47.180
right?,00:03:47.180,00:03:47.680
"So n is a moderate number that's
more manageable than 15,000.",00:03:47.680,00:03:51.430
From the 2012 race at random.,00:03:51.430,00:03:53.500
"That's where the random variable
is going to come from, right?",00:03:53.500,00:03:56.199
"That's where we actually inject
randomness in our problem.",00:03:56.199,00:03:58.615
"So remember this
is an experience.",00:04:02.789,00:04:04.205
"So really in a way, the
runners are the omegas.",00:04:04.205,00:04:06.970
"And I'm interested in
measurements on those guys.",00:04:06.970,00:04:10.150
"So this is how I have
a random variable.",00:04:10.150,00:04:11.980
"And this random verbal here is
measuring their running time.",00:04:11.980,00:04:15.570
OK.,00:04:15.570,00:04:16.120
"If you look at the data
set, you have all sorts",00:04:16.120,00:04:18.179
"of random variables
you could measure",00:04:18.179,00:04:19.720
about those random runners.,00:04:19.720,00:04:21.310
Country of origin.,00:04:21.310,00:04:22.630
"I don't know, height,
age, a bunch of things.",00:04:22.630,00:04:25.330
OK.,00:04:25.330,00:04:25.860
"Here, the random
variable of interest",00:04:25.860,00:04:27.401
being the running time.,00:04:27.401,00:04:29.750
OK.,00:04:29.750,00:04:30.250
"Everybody understand
what the process is?",00:04:30.250,00:04:32.510
OK.,00:04:32.510,00:04:33.010
"So now I'm going to have to
make some modeling assumptions.",00:04:33.010,00:04:36.220
"And here, I'm
actually pretty lucky.",00:04:36.220,00:04:37.930
"I actually have all the
data from a past year.",00:04:37.930,00:04:41.770
"I mean, this is not the data
from 2012, which I also have,",00:04:41.770,00:04:44.500
but I don't use.,00:04:44.500,00:04:45.504
"But I can actually use past
data to try to understand what",00:04:45.504,00:04:47.920
"distribution do I have, right?",00:04:47.920,00:04:49.210
"I mean, after all,
running time is going",00:04:49.210,00:04:51.610
to be rounded to something.,00:04:51.610,00:04:52.780
"Maybe I can think of it as
a discrete random variable.",00:04:52.780,00:04:55.632
"Maybe I can think of it as the
exponential random variable.",00:04:55.632,00:04:58.090
Those are positive numbers.,00:04:58.090,00:05:00.040
"I mean, there's many
kind of running times",00:05:00.040,00:05:01.896
that could come up to mind.,00:05:01.896,00:05:03.020
"Many kind of distributions
I could think",00:05:03.020,00:05:04.686
of for this modeling part.,00:05:04.686,00:05:06.630
"But it turns out
that if you actually",00:05:06.630,00:05:08.200
"plug the histogram of those
running times for all 15,000",00:05:08.200,00:05:11.440
"runners in 2009,
you actually are",00:05:11.440,00:05:14.410
"pretty happy to
see that it really",00:05:14.410,00:05:16.145
"looks like a bell-shaped
curve, which suggest",00:05:16.145,00:05:18.020
that this should be a Gaussian.,00:05:18.020,00:05:19.630
"So what you go on to do
is you estimate the mean",00:05:19.630,00:05:25.630
"from past observations, which
was actually 103.5, as we said.",00:05:25.630,00:05:29.800
"You submit the
variance, which was 373.",00:05:29.800,00:05:34.900
"And you just try to
superimpose the curve",00:05:34.900,00:05:37.960
"with this one, which is a
Gaussian PDF with mean 103.5",00:05:37.960,00:05:43.740
and variants 373.,00:05:43.740,00:05:45.160
"And you see that they
actually look very much alike.",00:05:45.160,00:05:48.110
"And so here, you're
pretty comfortable to say",00:05:48.110,00:05:50.530
"that the running time actually
is Gaussian distribution.",00:05:50.530,00:05:53.570
All right?,00:05:53.570,00:05:54.070
"So now I know that
the x1 to xn, I'm",00:05:54.070,00:05:56.410
"going to say they're
Gaussian, OK?",00:05:56.410,00:05:58.960
"I still need to
specify two parameters.",00:05:58.960,00:06:01.550
"So what I want to know is,
is the distribution the same",00:06:01.550,00:06:05.260
"from past years, right?",00:06:05.260,00:06:06.220
"So I want to know if the random
variable that I'm looking",00:06:06.220,00:06:08.380
"for-- if I, say, pick one.",00:06:08.380,00:06:09.463
"Say, x1.",00:06:09.463,00:06:10.510
"Does it have the same
distribution in 2012",00:06:10.510,00:06:12.730
that it did in 2009?,00:06:12.730,00:06:15.820
OK.,00:06:15.820,00:06:16.560
"And so, the question
is, is x1 has",00:06:16.560,00:06:19.330
"a Gaussian distribution with
mean 103.5 and variance 373?",00:06:19.330,00:06:23.530
Is that clear?,00:06:23.530,00:06:24.580
OK.,00:06:24.580,00:06:25.450
"So this question that calls
for a yes or no answer",00:06:25.450,00:06:30.250
is a hypothesis testing problem.,00:06:30.250,00:06:31.840
I am testing a hypothesis.,00:06:31.840,00:06:34.090
"And this is the basis
of basically all",00:06:34.090,00:06:36.850
"of data-driven
scientific inquiry.",00:06:36.850,00:06:39.490
You just ask questions.,00:06:39.490,00:06:40.570
"You formulate a
scientific hypothesis.",00:06:40.570,00:06:43.930
"Knocking down this gene is going
to cure melanoma, is this true?",00:06:43.930,00:06:48.816
I'm going to collect.,00:06:48.816,00:06:49.690
I'm going to try.,00:06:49.690,00:06:50.430
"I'm to observe some patients on
which I knock down this gene.",00:06:50.430,00:06:52.990
"I'm going to collect
some measurements.",00:06:52.990,00:06:54.615
"And I'm going to try to answer
this yes/no question, OK?",00:06:54.615,00:07:00.190
"It's different
from the question,",00:07:00.190,00:07:02.120
"what is the mean running
time for this year?",00:07:02.120,00:07:08.150
OK.,00:07:08.150,00:07:10.210
"So this hypothesis
testing is testing",00:07:10.210,00:07:12.350
if this hypothesis is true.,00:07:12.350,00:07:13.770
"The hypothesis in common
English we just said,",00:07:13.770,00:07:20.750
were runners running faster?,00:07:20.750,00:07:22.111
All right?,00:07:22.111,00:07:22.610
"Anybody could formulate
this hypothesis.",00:07:22.610,00:07:24.451
"Now, you go to a statistician.",00:07:24.451,00:07:25.700
"And he's like, oh,
what you're really",00:07:25.700,00:07:27.241
"asking me is x1 has a Gaussian
distribution with mean",00:07:27.241,00:07:32.750
"less than 103.5 and
variance 373, right?",00:07:32.750,00:07:35.630
"That's really the question that
you ask in statistical terms.",00:07:35.630,00:07:38.380
"And so, if you're asking if
this was the same as before,",00:07:38.380,00:07:42.050
"there's many ways it could
not be the same as before.",00:07:42.050,00:07:44.720
"There's basically
three ways it could not",00:07:44.720,00:07:46.490
be the same as before.,00:07:46.490,00:07:47.840
"It could be the case that x1
is in expectation to 103.5",00:07:47.840,00:07:54.360
So the expectation has changed.,00:07:54.360,00:07:56.610
Or the variance has changed.,00:07:56.610,00:07:58.710
Or the distribution has changed.,00:07:58.710,00:08:00.320
"I mean, who knows?",00:08:00.320,00:08:01.400
"Maybe runners are now just all
running holding their hands.",00:08:01.400,00:08:05.060
"And it's like now a point
mass at 1 given point.",00:08:05.060,00:08:08.190
OK.,00:08:08.190,00:08:08.690
"So you never know what
could [INAUDIBLE]..",00:08:08.690,00:08:11.000
"Now of course, if you
allow for any change,",00:08:11.000,00:08:14.060
you will find change.,00:08:14.060,00:08:16.111
"And so what you have to do is
to factor in as much knowledge",00:08:16.111,00:08:18.610
as you can.,00:08:18.610,00:08:19.270
"Make as many
modeling assumptions,",00:08:19.270,00:08:20.710
"so that you can
let the data speak",00:08:20.710,00:08:22.210
about your particular question.,00:08:22.210,00:08:23.730
"Here, your particular question
is, are they running faster?",00:08:23.730,00:08:27.230
"So you're only really asking a
question about the expectation.",00:08:27.230,00:08:30.460
"You really want to know if
the expectation has changed.",00:08:30.460,00:08:33.159
"So as far as you're
concerned, you're",00:08:33.159,00:08:35.114
"happy to make the
assumption that the rest has",00:08:35.114,00:08:37.030
been unchanged.,00:08:37.030,00:08:38.309
OK.,00:08:38.309,00:08:39.760
"And so, this is the
question we're asking.",00:08:39.760,00:08:42.429
"Is the expectation
now less than 103.5?",00:08:42.429,00:08:45.760
"Because you specifically
asked whether runners were",00:08:45.760,00:08:48.880
"going faster this year, right?",00:08:48.880,00:08:50.650
"They tend to go faster rather
than slower, all right?",00:08:50.650,00:08:55.420
OK.,00:08:55.420,00:08:56.470
"So this is the question we're
asking in mathematical terms.",00:08:56.470,00:09:00.030
"So first, when I did that, I
need to basically fix the rest.",00:09:00.030,00:09:03.350
"And fixing the rest
is actually part",00:09:03.350,00:09:05.450
of the modeling assumptions.,00:09:05.450,00:09:07.160
"So I fixed my
variance to be 373.",00:09:07.160,00:09:10.470
OK?,00:09:10.470,00:09:11.300
"I assume that the
variance has not",00:09:11.300,00:09:13.250
changed between 2009 and 2012.,00:09:13.250,00:09:17.120
"Now, this is an assumption.",00:09:17.120,00:09:18.620
It turns out it's wrong.,00:09:18.620,00:09:21.110
"So if you look at
the data from 2012,",00:09:21.110,00:09:22.910
"this is not the
correct assumption.",00:09:22.910,00:09:24.496
"But I'm just going
to make it right now",00:09:24.496,00:09:26.120
"for the sake of argument, OK?",00:09:26.120,00:09:29.700
"And also the fact
that it's Gaussian.",00:09:29.700,00:09:31.340
"Now, this is going to be
hard to violate, right?",00:09:31.340,00:09:34.850
"I mean, where did this
bell-shaped curve come from?",00:09:34.850,00:09:37.640
"Well, it's just natural when you
just measure a bunch of things.",00:09:37.640,00:09:42.480
"The central limit
theorem appears",00:09:42.480,00:09:44.070
in the small things of nature.,00:09:44.070,00:09:45.320
"I mean, that's the bedtime story
you get about the central limit",00:09:45.320,00:09:48.200
theorem.,00:09:48.200,00:09:48.900
"And that's why the bell-shaped
curve is everywhere in nature.",00:09:48.900,00:09:50.940
"It's the sum of little
independent things",00:09:50.940,00:09:52.730
that are going on.,00:09:52.730,00:09:53.910
"And this Gaussian assumption,
even if I wanted to relax it,",00:09:53.910,00:09:57.080
there's not much else I can do.,00:09:57.080,00:09:58.910
"It is pretty robust
across the years.",00:09:58.910,00:10:02.020
All right.,00:10:02.020,00:10:02.520
"So the only thing
that we did not fix",00:10:02.520,00:10:04.930
"is the expectation of x1, which
now I want to know what it is.",00:10:04.930,00:10:08.892
"And since I don't know what it
is, I'm going to call it mu.",00:10:08.892,00:10:11.350
"And it's going to be a variable
of interest, all right?",00:10:11.350,00:10:13.641
So it's just a number mu.,00:10:13.641,00:10:14.770
"Whatever this is I can try
to estimate it, maybe using",00:10:14.770,00:10:17.320
maximum likelihood estimation.,00:10:17.320,00:10:19.162
"Probably using the average,
because this is Gaussian.",00:10:19.162,00:10:21.370
"And we know that the
maximum likelihood",00:10:21.370,00:10:22.995
"estimator for a Gaussian
is just the average.",00:10:22.995,00:10:26.000
"And now we only want to test
if mu is equal to 103.5,",00:10:26.000,00:10:30.590
like it was in 2009.,00:10:30.590,00:10:34.100
"Or on the contrary, if
mu is not equal to 103.5.",00:10:34.100,00:10:37.774
"And more specifically,
if mu is actually",00:10:37.774,00:10:39.440
strictly less than 103.5.,00:10:39.440,00:10:41.240
That's the question you ask.,00:10:41.240,00:10:42.950
"Now, why am I in writing
mu equal to 103.5 or is",00:10:42.950,00:10:49.370
"less than 103.5
and equal to 103.5",00:10:49.370,00:10:53.240
versus not equal to 103.5?,00:10:53.240,00:10:55.450
"It's because since you asked
me a more precise question,",00:10:55.450,00:10:58.640
"I'm going to be able to give
you a more precise answer.",00:10:58.640,00:11:01.270
"And so, if your question
is very specific--",00:11:01.270,00:11:03.890
are they running faster?,00:11:03.890,00:11:05.960
"I'm going to factor
that in what I write.",00:11:05.960,00:11:08.440
"If you just ask
me, is it the same?",00:11:08.440,00:11:10.310
"I'm going to have to write,
or is it different than 103.5?",00:11:10.310,00:11:13.647
"And that's less
information about what",00:11:13.647,00:11:15.230
"you're looking for, OK?",00:11:15.230,00:11:19.200
"So by making all these
modeling assumptions--",00:11:19.200,00:11:23.500
"the fact that the
variance doesn't change,",00:11:23.500,00:11:25.250
"the fact that it's
still Gaussian--",00:11:25.250,00:11:26.708
"I've actually reduced
the number of.",00:11:26.708,00:11:31.050
"And I put numbers in quotes,
because this is still",00:11:31.050,00:11:34.440
an infinite of them.,00:11:34.440,00:11:35.660
"But I'm limiting
the number of ways",00:11:35.660,00:11:38.220
the hypothesis can be violated.,00:11:38.220,00:11:40.875
"The number of possible
alternative realities",00:11:43.380,00:11:46.050
"for this hypothesis, all right?",00:11:46.050,00:11:48.540
"For example, I'm
saying there's no way",00:11:48.540,00:11:50.520
mu can be larger than 103.5.,00:11:50.520,00:11:53.400
"I've already
factored that in, OK?",00:11:53.400,00:11:55.710
It could be.,00:11:55.710,00:11:56.700
"But I'm actually just going
to say that if it's larger,",00:11:56.700,00:11:59.550
"all I'm going to be able to tell
you is that it's not smaller.",00:11:59.550,00:12:02.940
"I'm not going to
be able to tell you",00:12:02.940,00:12:06.290
"that it's actually larger, OK?",00:12:06.290,00:12:07.710
"And the only way it
can be rejected now.",00:12:12.830,00:12:15.830
"The only way I can
reject my hypothesis",00:12:15.830,00:12:17.990
"is if x belongs to very specific
family of distributions.",00:12:17.990,00:12:22.900
"If it has a distribution
which is Gaussian",00:12:22.900,00:12:24.650
"with mean mu and variance of
373 for mu, which is less 103.5.",00:12:24.650,00:12:29.820
All right?,00:12:29.820,00:12:30.320
"So we started with
basically was x1--",00:12:30.320,00:12:40.240
so that's the reality.,00:12:40.240,00:12:41.470
"x1 follows n 103.5 373, OK?",00:12:41.470,00:12:49.840
"And this is everything
else, right?",00:12:49.840,00:12:53.690
"So for example,
here is x follows",00:12:53.690,00:12:55.680
"some exponential, 0.1, OK?",00:12:55.680,00:13:02.410
"This is just another
distribution here.",00:13:02.410,00:13:04.270
"Those are all the
possible distributions.",00:13:04.270,00:13:06.040
"What we said is we said,
OK, first of all, let's just",00:13:06.040,00:13:09.010
"keep only those Gaussian
distributions, right?",00:13:09.010,00:13:13.780
"And second, we said, well, among
those Gaussian distributions,",00:13:13.780,00:13:18.100
"let's only look at
those that have-- well,",00:13:18.100,00:13:20.290
"maybe this one should
be at the boundary--",00:13:20.290,00:13:24.370
"let's only look at
the Gaussians here.",00:13:24.370,00:13:26.650
"So this guy here are
all the Gaussians",00:13:26.650,00:13:33.820
"with mean mu and variance 373
for mu less than 103.5, OK?",00:13:33.820,00:13:43.290
"So when you're going
to give me data,",00:13:43.290,00:13:45.360
"I'm going to be able to
say, well, am I this guy?",00:13:45.360,00:13:48.660
Or am I one of those guys?,00:13:48.660,00:13:49.772
"Rather than searching
through everything.",00:13:49.772,00:13:51.480
"And the more you search
the easier for you",00:13:51.480,00:13:53.940
"to find something that fits
better the data, right?",00:13:53.940,00:13:56.980
"And so, if I allow
everything possible,",00:13:56.980,00:14:00.000
"then there's going
to be something",00:14:00.000,00:14:01.800
"that just by pure randomness is
actually going to look better",00:14:01.800,00:14:04.770
"for the data, OK?",00:14:04.770,00:14:06.490
"So for example, if I draw
10 random variables, right?",00:14:09.510,00:14:12.780
If n is equal to 10.,00:14:12.780,00:14:15.840
"And let's say they take
10 different values.",00:14:15.840,00:14:18.150
"Then it's actually more
likely that those guys",00:14:18.150,00:14:20.070
"come from a discrete
distribution that",00:14:20.070,00:14:23.040
"takes each of these values
with probability 1 over 10,",00:14:23.040,00:14:27.350
"than actually some Gaussian
random variable, right?",00:14:27.350,00:14:30.560
That would be perfect.,00:14:30.560,00:14:31.507
I can actually explain it.,00:14:31.507,00:14:32.590
"If the 10 numbers
I got were say--",00:14:32.590,00:14:36.740
"let's say I collect
3, 90, 95, and 102.",00:14:36.740,00:14:41.870
"Then the most likely
distribution for those guys",00:14:41.870,00:14:44.420
"is the discrete
distribution that",00:14:44.420,00:14:46.490
"takes three values, 91
with probability 1/3, 95",00:14:46.490,00:14:51.260
"with probability 1/3, and
102 with probably 1/3, right?",00:14:51.260,00:14:57.387
"That's definitely the most
likely distribution for this.",00:14:57.387,00:14:59.720
"So if I allowed this,
I would say, oh no.",00:14:59.720,00:15:02.090
"This is not distributed
according to that.",00:15:02.090,00:15:04.610
"It's distributed according
to this very specific",00:15:04.610,00:15:06.920
"distribution, which is
somewhere in the realm",00:15:06.920,00:15:09.800
"of all possible
distributions, OK?",00:15:09.800,00:15:12.450
"So now we're just going to try
to carve out all this stuff",00:15:12.450,00:15:15.480
by making our assumptions.,00:15:15.480,00:15:18.570
OK.,00:15:18.570,00:15:19.070
"So here in this
particular example,",00:15:19.070,00:15:20.870
"just make a mental note
that what we're doing",00:15:20.870,00:15:23.270
is that I actually--,00:15:23.270,00:15:25.580
"a little birdie told me that the
reference number is 103.5, OK?",00:15:25.580,00:15:31.340
"That was the thing I'm
actually looking for.",00:15:31.340,00:15:34.760
"In practice, it's
actually seldom the case",00:15:34.760,00:15:36.680
"that you have this reference
for yourself to think of, right?",00:15:36.680,00:15:40.260
"Maybe here, I just happen
to have a full data",00:15:40.260,00:15:43.260
set of all the runners of 2009.,00:15:43.260,00:15:46.620
"But if I really just
asked you, I said,",00:15:46.620,00:15:50.680
"were runners faster
in 2012 than in 2009?",00:15:50.680,00:15:55.990
"Here's $10 to perform
your statistical analysis.",00:15:55.990,00:15:59.262
"What you're probably going to
do is called maybe 10 runners",00:15:59.262,00:16:01.720
"from 2012, maybe 15
runners from 2009,",00:16:01.720,00:16:05.380
"ask them and try to
compare their mean.",00:16:05.380,00:16:07.930
There's no standard reference.,00:16:07.930,00:16:09.250
"You would not be able to
come up with this 103.5,",00:16:09.250,00:16:11.680
"because these data maybe is
expensive to get or something.",00:16:11.680,00:16:14.630
OK.,00:16:14.630,00:16:15.130
"So this is really more of
the standard case, all right?",00:16:15.130,00:16:18.250
"Where you really compare
two things with each other,",00:16:18.250,00:16:21.310
"but there's no actual
ground truth number",00:16:21.310,00:16:23.830
that you're comparing it to.,00:16:23.830,00:16:26.280
OK.,00:16:26.280,00:16:26.780
"So we'll come back
to that in a second.",00:16:26.780,00:16:28.700
"I'll tell you what the
other example looks like.",00:16:28.700,00:16:32.070
"So let's just stick
to this example.",00:16:32.070,00:16:34.430
"I tell you it's 103.5, OK?",00:16:34.430,00:16:36.710
"Let's try to have our
intuition work the same way.",00:16:36.710,00:16:39.170
"We said, well,
averages worked well.",00:16:39.170,00:16:42.710
"The average, tell me,
of over these 10 guys",00:16:42.710,00:16:46.970
"should tell me what
the mean should be.",00:16:46.970,00:16:49.820
"So I can just say,
well x bar is going",00:16:49.820,00:16:52.460
"to be close to the true mean
by the law of large number.",00:16:52.460,00:16:55.500
"So I'm going to decide whether
x bar is less than 103.5.",00:16:55.500,00:17:00.600
"And conclude that in this case,
indeed mu is less than 103.5,",00:17:00.600,00:17:04.069
"because those two
quantities are close, right?",00:17:04.069,00:17:06.859
I could do that.,00:17:06.859,00:17:08.609
"The problem is that this
could go pretty wrong.",00:17:08.609,00:17:10.670
"Because if n is
small, then I know",00:17:10.670,00:17:13.730
that xn bar is not equal to mu.,00:17:13.730,00:17:17.400
"I know that xn bar
is close to mu.",00:17:17.400,00:17:19.819
"But I also know that
there's pretty high chance",00:17:19.819,00:17:21.859
that it's not equal to mu.,00:17:21.859,00:17:23.150
"In particular, I know it's going
to be somewhere at 1 over root",00:17:23.150,00:17:26.410
"n away from mu, right?",00:17:26.410,00:17:28.580
"1 over root n being the
root coming from what?",00:17:28.580,00:17:31.690
"CLT, right?",00:17:34.820,00:17:35.600
"That's the root n that comes
from CLT. In blunt words,",00:17:35.600,00:17:40.700
"CLT tells me the
mean is at distance",00:17:40.700,00:17:44.510
"1 over root n from the
expectation, pretty much.",00:17:44.510,00:17:47.600
That's what it's telling.,00:17:47.600,00:17:48.920
So 1 over root n.,00:17:48.920,00:17:49.910
"If I have 10 people in
there, 1 over root 10",00:17:52.510,00:17:55.790
"is not a huge number, right?",00:17:55.790,00:17:57.170
It's like 1/3 pretty much.,00:17:57.170,00:18:00.290
So 1/3 103.5.,00:18:00.290,00:18:02.850
"If the true mean
was actually 103.4,",00:18:02.850,00:18:07.940
"but my average was telling
me it's 103.4 plus 1/3,",00:18:07.940,00:18:12.834
"I would actually come to two
different conclusions, right?",00:18:12.834,00:18:15.250
"So let's say that mu
is equal to 103.4, OK?",00:18:22.620,00:18:29.400
"So you're not supposed
to know this, right?",00:18:29.400,00:18:32.700
That's the hidden truth.,00:18:32.700,00:18:34.350
OK.,00:18:37.900,00:18:38.400
Now I have n is equal to 10.,00:18:38.400,00:18:40.380
"So I know that x
bar n minus 103.4",00:18:40.380,00:18:49.190
"is something of the order of
1 over the square root of 10,",00:18:49.190,00:18:52.470
"which is of the
order of, say, 0.3.",00:18:52.470,00:18:57.840
OK.,00:18:57.840,00:18:58.340
"So here, this is
all hand wavy, OK?",00:18:58.340,00:19:01.480
"But that's what the central
limit theorem tells me.",00:19:01.480,00:19:05.120
"What it means is
that it is possible",00:19:05.120,00:19:13.260
"that x bar n is actually
equal to is actually",00:19:13.260,00:19:20.030
"equal to 103.4 plus 0.3,
which is equal to 103.7.",00:19:20.030,00:19:30.970
"Which means that while the truth
is that mu is less than 103.5,",00:19:30.970,00:19:40.350
"then I would conclude that
mu is larger than 103.5, OK?",00:19:40.350,00:19:47.572
"And that's because I have
not been very cautious, OK?",00:19:47.572,00:19:49.780
"So what we want to do is
to have a little buffer",00:19:52.990,00:19:56.170
"to account for the
fact that xn bar is not",00:19:56.170,00:19:58.750
a precise value for the true mu.,00:19:58.750,00:20:01.525
"It's something that's 1
over root n away from you.",00:20:01.525,00:20:05.180
"And so, what we want is
the better heuristic that",00:20:05.180,00:20:07.420
"says, well, if I want
to conclude that I'm",00:20:07.420,00:20:09.550
"less than 103.5, maybe I
need to be less than 103.5",00:20:09.550,00:20:14.270
"minus a little buffer that goes
to 0 as my sample size goes",00:20:14.270,00:20:17.920
to infinity.,00:20:17.920,00:20:19.300
"And actually, that's what the
law of large number tells me.",00:20:19.300,00:20:22.354
"The central limit
theorem actually",00:20:22.354,00:20:23.770
"tells me that this
should be true,",00:20:23.770,00:20:26.740
"something that goes to
0 as n goes to infinity",00:20:26.740,00:20:30.030
"and the rate 1
over root n, right?",00:20:30.030,00:20:32.850
"That's basically what the
central limit theorem tells me.",00:20:32.850,00:20:36.680
"So to make this
intuition more precise,",00:20:36.680,00:20:39.170
"we need to understand
those fluctuations.",00:20:39.170,00:20:41.490
"We need to actually
put in something",00:20:41.490,00:20:43.610
"that's more precise than
these little wiggles here, OK?",00:20:43.610,00:20:47.102
"We need to actually have the
central limit theorem come in.",00:20:47.102,00:20:49.560
"So here is the example
of comparing two groups.",00:20:53.110,00:20:57.340
"So pharmaceutical
companies use hypothesis",00:20:57.340,00:21:00.700
"testing to test if a
drug is efficient, right?",00:21:00.700,00:21:03.167
That's what they do.,00:21:03.167,00:21:04.000
"They want to know,
does my new drug work?",00:21:04.000,00:21:06.170
"And that's what the Federal
Drug Administration office",00:21:06.170,00:21:09.175
is doing on a daily basis.,00:21:09.175,00:21:11.560
"They ask for extremely well
regulated clinical trials",00:21:11.560,00:21:18.660
"on a thousand people,
and check, does this drug",00:21:18.660,00:21:22.530
make a difference?,00:21:22.530,00:21:23.460
Did everybody die?,00:21:23.460,00:21:24.900
Does it make no difference?,00:21:24.900,00:21:27.270
"Should people pay $200 for
a pill of sugar, right?",00:21:27.270,00:21:30.450
"So that's what people
are actually asking.",00:21:30.450,00:21:33.030
"So to do so, of course, there
is no ground truth about--",00:21:33.030,00:21:36.060
"so there's actually
a placebo effect.",00:21:36.060,00:21:38.830
"So it's not like actually
giving a drug that does not work",00:21:38.830,00:21:41.970
"is going to have no
effect on patients.",00:21:41.970,00:21:44.400
"It will have a small effect,
but it's very hard to quantify.",00:21:44.400,00:21:47.320
"We know that it's there, but
we don't know what it is.",00:21:47.320,00:21:50.460
"And so rather than saying,
oh the ground truth",00:21:50.460,00:21:52.670
"is no improvement, the ground
truth is the placebo effect.",00:21:52.670,00:21:56.280
"And we need to measure
what the placebo effect is.",00:21:56.280,00:22:00.020
"So what we're going
to do is we're",00:22:00.020,00:22:01.730
"going to split our
patients into two groups.",00:22:01.730,00:22:04.730
"And there's going to
be what's called a test",00:22:04.730,00:22:06.590
group and a control group.,00:22:06.590,00:22:10.020
"So the word test here is
used in a different way",00:22:10.020,00:22:13.040
than hypothesis testing.,00:22:13.040,00:22:14.220
"So we'll just call it
typically the drug group.",00:22:14.220,00:22:17.490
"And so, I will refer to
mu drug for this guy, OK?",00:22:17.490,00:22:22.790
"Now, this let's say this
is a cough syrup, OK?",00:22:22.790,00:22:26.120
"And when you have a
cough syrup, the way",00:22:26.120,00:22:29.990
"you measure the efficacy
of a cough syrup",00:22:29.990,00:22:34.520
"is to measure how many times
you cough per minute, OK?",00:22:34.520,00:22:40.000
"And so, if I define
mu control the number",00:22:40.000,00:22:42.740
of expectoration per hour.,00:22:42.740,00:22:48.840
"So just the expected
number, right?",00:22:48.840,00:22:50.500
"This is the number I don't know,
because I don't have access",00:22:50.500,00:22:53.000
"to the entire population
of people that will ever",00:22:53.000,00:22:55.430
take this cough syrup.,00:22:55.430,00:22:57.590
"And so, I will call it mu
control for the control group.",00:22:57.590,00:23:00.526
"So those are the people who
have been actually given just",00:23:00.526,00:23:02.900
"like sugar, like maple syrup.",00:23:02.900,00:23:05.330
"And mu drug are those people who
are given the actual syrup, OK?",00:23:05.330,00:23:09.440
"And you can imagine that maybe
maple syrup will have an effect",00:23:09.440,00:23:12.710
"on expectorations per hour just
because, well, it's just sweet",00:23:12.710,00:23:18.020
"and it helps, OK?",00:23:18.020,00:23:19.040
"And so, we don't know what
this effect is going to be.",00:23:19.040,00:23:21.290
"We just want to measure
if the drug is actually",00:23:21.290,00:23:24.920
"having just a better
impact on expectorations",00:23:24.920,00:23:28.670
"per hour than the just
pure maple syrup, OK?",00:23:28.670,00:23:34.700
"So what we want to know is if
mu drug is less than mu control.",00:23:34.700,00:23:38.385
That would be enough.,00:23:38.385,00:23:39.260
"If we had access to
all the populations",00:23:39.260,00:23:41.540
"that will ever take
the syrup for all ages,",00:23:41.540,00:23:44.390
"then we would just measure,
did this have an impact?",00:23:44.390,00:23:46.760
"And even if it's a slightly
ever so small impact,",00:23:46.760,00:23:49.880
"then it's good to
release this cough syrup,",00:23:49.880,00:23:52.760
"assuming that it has no side
effects or anything like this,",00:23:52.760,00:23:55.430
"because it's just better
than maple syrup, OK?",00:23:55.430,00:23:58.370
"The problem is that we
don't have access to this.",00:23:58.370,00:24:00.430
"And we're going to have to make
this decision based on samples",00:24:00.430,00:24:03.110
"that give me imprecise knowledge
about mu drug and mu control.",00:24:03.110,00:24:09.140
"So in this case,
unlike the first case",00:24:09.140,00:24:10.870
"where we compared an
unknown expected value",00:24:10.870,00:24:13.990
"to have a fixed number, which
was one of the 103.5, here,",00:24:13.990,00:24:17.530
"we're just comparing two unknown
numbers with each other, OK?",00:24:17.530,00:24:20.980
"So there's two
sources of randomness.",00:24:20.980,00:24:22.522
"Trying to estimate
the first one.",00:24:22.522,00:24:23.896
"And trying to estimate
the second one.",00:24:23.896,00:24:25.492
"Before I move on, I just
wanted to tell you I apologize.",00:24:29.190,00:24:31.860
"One of the graders was not able
to finish grading his problem",00:24:31.860,00:24:34.480
sets for today.,00:24:34.480,00:24:35.240
"So for those of you who are here
just to pick up their homework,",00:24:35.240,00:24:39.390
feel free to leave now.,00:24:39.390,00:24:41.010
"Even if you have a name tag, I
will pretend I did not read it.",00:24:41.010,00:24:45.071
OK.,00:24:45.071,00:24:45.570
So I'm sorry.,00:24:45.570,00:24:47.300
You'll get it on Tuesday.,00:24:47.300,00:24:49.970
And this will not happen again.,00:24:49.970,00:24:53.540
OK.,00:24:53.540,00:24:54.510
"So for the clinical
trials, now I'm",00:24:54.510,00:24:56.722
going to collect information.,00:24:56.722,00:24:57.930
"I'm going to collect the
data from the control group.",00:24:57.930,00:25:00.138
"And I'm going to collect data
from the test group, all right?",00:25:00.138,00:25:03.420
So my control group here.,00:25:03.420,00:25:05.490
"I don't have to collect the same
number of people in the control",00:25:05.490,00:25:08.170
group than in the drug group.,00:25:08.170,00:25:09.600
"Actually, for cough syrup,
maybe it's not that important.",00:25:09.600,00:25:12.520
"But you can imagine
that if you think",00:25:12.520,00:25:14.790
"you have the cure to a
really annoying disease,",00:25:14.790,00:25:20.160
"it's actually hard to tell
half of the people you",00:25:20.160,00:25:23.910
"will get a pill of nothing, OK?",00:25:23.910,00:25:26.460
"People tend to want
to try the drug.",00:25:26.460,00:25:28.140
They're desperate.,00:25:28.140,00:25:28.942
"And so, you have to have
this sort of imbalance",00:25:28.942,00:25:30.900
"between who is getting the drug
and who's not getting the drug.",00:25:30.900,00:25:35.390
"And people have to qualify
for the clinical trials.",00:25:35.390,00:25:37.865
"There's lots of
fluctuations that",00:25:37.865,00:25:39.240
"affect what the final numbers
of people who are actually",00:25:39.240,00:25:42.091
"going to get the drug and
are going to get the control",00:25:42.091,00:25:44.340
is going to be.,00:25:44.340,00:25:45.180
"And so, it's not easy for you
to make those two numbers equal.",00:25:45.180,00:25:49.277
"You'd like to have those
numbers equal if you can,",00:25:49.277,00:25:51.360
but not necessarily.,00:25:51.360,00:25:55.910

of some mystical science called",00:25:55.910,00:25:59.270
"""design of experiments.""",00:25:59.270,00:26:00.440

you can imagine",00:26:00.440,00:26:02.780
"that if one of the series
had higher variants,",00:26:02.780,00:26:04.910

more people in this group",00:26:04.910,00:26:07.040
than the other group.,00:26:07.040,00:26:08.000
Yeah?,00:26:08.000,00:26:10.982
"STUDENT: So when we're
subtracting [INAUDIBLE]",00:26:10.982,00:26:13.964

that's on purpose.",00:26:22.420,00:26:23.180
"And I'll come to that
in a second, all right?",00:26:23.180,00:26:25.055
"So basically, we're
going to make it",00:26:25.055,00:26:31.130
"if your answer is, is this true?",00:26:31.130,00:26:34.760
"We're going to make it as hard
as possible, but no harder",00:26:34.760,00:26:39.170
"for you to say yes
to this answer.",00:26:39.170,00:26:41.150
"Because, well, we'll see why.",00:26:41.150,00:26:43.230
"OK, so now we have two set
of data, the x's and the y's.",00:26:45.900,00:26:50.040
"The x's are the
ones for the drug.",00:26:50.040,00:26:51.810
"And the y's are the data that I
collected from the people, who",00:26:51.810,00:26:55.230
"were just given a placebo, OK?",00:26:55.230,00:26:57.520
"And so, they're all
IID random variables.",00:26:57.520,00:26:59.280
"And here, since it's the
number of expectorations,",00:26:59.280,00:27:02.220
"I'm making a blunt
modeling assumption.",00:27:02.220,00:27:07.352
"I'm just going to
say it's Poisson.",00:27:07.352,00:27:08.810
"And it's characterized only by
the mean mu drug or the mean mu",00:27:08.810,00:27:11.990
"control, OK?",00:27:11.990,00:27:13.440
"I've just made an
assumption here.",00:27:13.440,00:27:15.090
It could be something different.,00:27:15.090,00:27:16.750
"But let's say it's a
Poisson distribution.",00:27:16.750,00:27:19.260
"So now what I want to know
is to test whether mu drug is",00:27:19.260,00:27:21.655
less than mu control.,00:27:21.655,00:27:22.530
We said that already.,00:27:22.530,00:27:23.880
"But the way we said it before
was not as mathematical",00:27:23.880,00:27:26.340
as it is now.,00:27:26.340,00:27:27.120
"Now we're actually making
a test on the parameters",00:27:27.120,00:27:29.520
of Poisson distribution.,00:27:29.520,00:27:30.540
"Whereas before, we
were just making test",00:27:30.540,00:27:32.610
"on expected numbers, OK?",00:27:32.610,00:27:36.410
"So the heuristic-- again, if we
try to apply the heuristic now.",00:27:36.410,00:27:39.650
"Rather than comparing mu x
bar drug to some fixed number,",00:27:39.650,00:27:42.890
"I'm actually comparing x
bar drug to some control.",00:27:42.890,00:27:46.306
"But now here, I need to have
something that accounts for,",00:27:46.306,00:27:48.680
"not only the fluctuations
of x bar drug,",00:27:48.680,00:27:51.200
"but also for the fluctuations
of x bar control, OK?",00:27:51.200,00:27:55.406
"And so, now I need
something that",00:27:55.406,00:27:56.780
"goes to 0 when all those
two things go to infinity.",00:27:56.780,00:27:59.540
"And typically, it should go to
zero with 1 over root of n drug",00:27:59.540,00:28:02.840
"and 1 over square
root of n control, OK?",00:28:02.840,00:28:06.340
"That's what the central
limit theorem for both x bar",00:28:06.340,00:28:08.830
drug and x bar control.,00:28:08.830,00:28:11.320
"Two central limit theorems
are actually telling.",00:28:11.320,00:28:15.261
OK.,00:28:15.261,00:28:15.760
"And then we can conclude
that this happens.",00:28:15.760,00:28:17.840
"And as you said, we're
trying to make it",00:28:17.840,00:28:19.570
a bit harder to conclude this.,00:28:19.570,00:28:21.700
Because let's face it.,00:28:21.700,00:28:23.830
"If we were actually using
two simple heuristic, right?",00:28:23.830,00:28:26.800
"For simplicity, right?",00:28:30.114,00:28:31.030
"So I can rewrite x bar drug
less than x bar control",00:28:35.880,00:28:43.930
"minus this something
that goes to 0.",00:28:43.930,00:28:46.060
"I can write it as x bar drug
minus x bar control less",00:28:46.060,00:28:54.650
"than something negative, OK?",00:28:54.650,00:28:57.930
"This little something, OK?",00:28:57.930,00:29:00.280
So now let's look at those guys.,00:29:00.280,00:29:02.990
"This is the difference
of two random variables.",00:29:02.990,00:29:06.470
"From the central
limit theorem, they",00:29:06.470,00:29:08.570
"should be approximately
Gaussian each.",00:29:08.570,00:29:12.914

going to think",00:29:12.914,00:29:14.330
of them as being independent.,00:29:14.330,00:29:15.660
"There's no reason why the
people in the control group",00:29:15.660,00:29:18.460
"should have any effect
on what's happening",00:29:18.460,00:29:20.210
to the people in the test group.,00:29:20.210,00:29:21.350
"Those people probably
don't even know each other.",00:29:21.350,00:29:23.550
"And so, when I look at this,
this should look like n 0",00:29:23.550,00:29:27.056
"with some mean
and some variants,",00:29:27.056,00:29:28.430
"let's say I don't
know what it is, OK?",00:29:28.430,00:29:30.590
The mean I actually know.,00:29:30.590,00:29:31.940
"It's mu drug minus
mu control, OK?",00:29:31.940,00:29:37.250
"So if they were to plot
the PDF of this guy,",00:29:37.250,00:29:39.950
it would look like this.,00:29:39.950,00:29:41.210
"I would have something
which is centered",00:29:41.210,00:29:42.890
at mu drug minus mu control.,00:29:42.890,00:29:45.590
"And it would look like this, OK?",00:29:48.280,00:29:51.880
"Now let's say that mu drug is
actually equal to mu control.",00:29:51.880,00:29:55.780
"That this pharmaceutical
company is a huge scam.",00:29:55.780,00:29:59.810
"And they really are trying
to sell bottled corn",00:29:59.810,00:30:04.810
"syrup for $200 a pop, OK?",00:30:04.810,00:30:07.580
So this is a huge scam.,00:30:07.580,00:30:08.980
"And the true things are
actually equal to 0.",00:30:08.980,00:30:12.010
"So this thing is really
centered about 0, OK?",00:30:12.010,00:30:15.670
"Now, if were not to do
this, then basically, half",00:30:15.670,00:30:18.760
"of the time I would
actually come up",00:30:18.760,00:30:20.890
"with a distribution
that's above this value.",00:30:20.890,00:30:22.900
"And half of the time I
would have something that's",00:30:22.900,00:30:24.370
"below this value, which would
mean that half of the scams",00:30:24.370,00:30:27.070
"would actually go through
FDA if I did not do this.",00:30:27.070,00:30:31.040
"So what I'm trying to
do is to say, well, OK.",00:30:31.040,00:30:33.340
"You have to be here, so
that there is actually",00:30:33.340,00:30:35.830
"a very low probability
that just by chance",00:30:35.830,00:30:37.930
you end up being here.,00:30:37.930,00:30:40.120
"And we'll make all the
statements extremely precise",00:30:40.120,00:30:42.520
later on.,00:30:42.520,00:30:43.780
"But I think the
drug thing makes it",00:30:43.780,00:30:46.060
"interesting to see why
you're making it hard,",00:30:46.060,00:30:49.330
"because You don't
want to allow people",00:30:49.330,00:30:51.220
to sell a thing like that.,00:30:51.220,00:30:52.420
"Before we go more into the
statistical thinking associated",00:30:55.830,00:30:58.620
"to tests, let's just
see how we would",00:30:58.620,00:31:01.050
"do this quantification, right?",00:31:01.050,00:31:02.460
"I mean after all, this
is what we probably",00:31:02.460,00:31:04.410
"are the most comfortable
with at this point.",00:31:04.410,00:31:07.590
"So let's just try
to understand this.",00:31:07.590,00:31:10.650
"And I'm going to make the
statisticians favorite test,",00:31:10.650,00:31:16.060
"which is the thing that
obviously you do at home all",00:31:16.060,00:31:19.700
"the time every time
you get a new quarter,",00:31:19.700,00:31:21.450
"is testing whether it's
a fair coin or not.",00:31:21.450,00:31:23.740
All right?,00:31:23.740,00:31:24.240
"So this test, of course,
exists only in textbooks.",00:31:24.240,00:31:27.840
"And I actually did
not write this slide.",00:31:27.840,00:31:30.780
"I was lazy to just
replace all this stuff",00:31:30.780,00:31:32.670
by the Cherry Blossom Run.,00:31:32.670,00:31:37.410
So you have a coin.,00:31:37.410,00:31:38.440
"Now you have 80
observations, x1 to x80.",00:31:38.440,00:31:42.330
So n is equal to 80.,00:31:42.330,00:31:45.420
"I have x1, xn, IID, Bernoulli p.",00:31:45.420,00:31:53.820
"And I want to know if
I have a fair coin.",00:31:53.820,00:31:55.570
"So in mathematical
language, I want",00:31:55.570,00:31:57.330
to know if p is equal to 1/2.,00:31:57.330,00:32:00.380
"Let's say this is
just the heads, OK?",00:32:04.800,00:32:07.680
And a biased coin?,00:32:07.680,00:32:09.030
"Well, maybe you
would potentially",00:32:09.030,00:32:10.536
"be interested
whether it's biased",00:32:10.536,00:32:11.910
one direction or the other.,00:32:11.910,00:32:13.034
"But not being a fair
coin is already somewhat",00:32:13.034,00:32:15.900
"of a discovery, OK?",00:32:15.900,00:32:17.360
"And so, you just want to know
whether p is equal to 1/2",00:32:17.360,00:32:20.520
"or p is not equal to 1/2, OK?",00:32:20.520,00:32:25.280
"Now, if I were to apply the
very naive first example",00:32:25.280,00:32:29.890
to not reject this hypothesis.,00:32:29.890,00:32:32.080
"If I run this thing
80 times, I need",00:32:32.080,00:32:35.710
"to see exactly 40
heads and 40 tales.",00:32:35.710,00:32:40.360
"Now this is very unlikely
to happen exactly.",00:32:40.360,00:32:43.960
"You're going to have close to
40 heads and close to 40 tails,",00:32:43.960,00:32:47.200
"but how close should
those things be?",00:32:47.200,00:32:49.510
OK?,00:32:49.510,00:32:50.310
"And so, the little
something is going",00:32:50.310,00:32:52.540
"to be quantified by
exactly this, OK?",00:32:52.540,00:32:55.300
"So now here, let's say that my
experiment gave me 54 heads.",00:32:55.300,00:33:06.490
That's 54?,00:33:06.490,00:33:07.541
Yeah.,00:33:07.541,00:33:08.040
"Which means that my xn bar
is 54 over 80, which is 0.68.",00:33:10.870,00:33:21.100
All right?,00:33:21.100,00:33:21.970
So I have this estimator.,00:33:21.970,00:33:24.580
"Looks pretty large, right?",00:33:24.580,00:33:26.620
"It's much larger than
0.5, so it does look like,",00:33:26.620,00:33:29.950
"and my mom would
certainly conclude,",00:33:29.950,00:33:32.080
"that this is a
biased coin for sure,",00:33:32.080,00:33:34.240
because she thinks I'm tricky.,00:33:34.240,00:33:35.870
All right.,00:33:35.870,00:33:36.370
"So the question is, can
this be due to chance?",00:33:36.370,00:33:40.110
Can this be due to chance alone?,00:33:40.110,00:33:42.050
"Like what is the likelihood
that a fair coin would actually",00:33:42.050,00:33:45.490
"end up being 54 times
on heads rather than 40?",00:33:45.490,00:33:51.800
OK?,00:33:51.800,00:33:52.900
"And so, what we do
is we say, OK, I",00:33:52.900,00:33:55.540
"need to understand, what is
the distribution of the number",00:33:55.540,00:33:58.370
of times it comes on heads?,00:33:58.370,00:33:59.732
"And this is going
to be a binomial,",00:33:59.732,00:34:01.190
"but it's a little
annoying to play with.",00:34:01.190,00:34:02.984
"So we're going to use the
central limit theorem that",00:34:02.984,00:34:05.150
"tells me that xn
bar minus p divided",00:34:05.150,00:34:10.790
"by square root of p1 minus p
is approximately distributed",00:34:10.790,00:34:15.940
as an n01.,00:34:15.940,00:34:17.300
"And here, since
n is equal to 80,",00:34:17.300,00:34:18.944
"I'm pretty safe that this
is actually going to work.",00:34:18.944,00:34:21.110
"And I can actually
use [INAUDIBLE],,",00:34:28.420,00:34:33.300
and put xn bar here.,00:34:33.300,00:34:34.510
"[INAUDIBLE] tells me
that this is OK to do.",00:34:38.050,00:34:40.980
All right.,00:34:40.980,00:34:41.480
"So now I'm actually
going to compute this.",00:34:41.480,00:34:43.350
"So here, I know this.",00:34:43.350,00:34:44.870
This is square root of 80.,00:34:44.870,00:34:46.280
This is a 0.68.,00:34:46.280,00:34:48.860
What is this value here?,00:34:48.860,00:34:50.210
We'll talk about it.,00:34:50.210,00:34:51.179
"Well, we're trying to
understand what happens",00:34:51.179,00:34:53.090
"if it is a fair coin, right?",00:34:53.090,00:34:55.610
"So if fair, then p is
equal to 0.5, right?",00:34:55.610,00:35:02.220
"So what I want to know
is, what is the likelihood",00:35:02.220,00:35:05.160
"that a fair coin
would give me 0.68?",00:35:05.160,00:35:09.240
Let me finish.,00:35:09.240,00:35:10.560
All right.,00:35:10.560,00:35:11.850
"What is the likelihood
that a fair coin will",00:35:11.850,00:35:14.190
"allow me to do this, so I'm
actually allowed to plug-in p",00:35:14.190,00:35:17.470
to be 0.5 here?,00:35:17.470,00:35:19.530
"Now, your question is, why
do I not plug-in p to be 0.5?",00:35:19.530,00:35:25.000
But you can.,00:35:25.000,00:35:25.640
All right.,00:35:25.640,00:35:26.140
"I just want to make you plug-in
p at one specific point,",00:35:26.140,00:35:29.024
but you're absolutely right.,00:35:29.024,00:35:30.190
OK.,00:35:34.040,00:35:34.540
"Let's forget about your
question for one second.",00:35:34.540,00:35:37.270
"So now I'm going to have to
look at xn bar minus 0.5 divided",00:35:37.270,00:35:41.590
by xn bar 1 minus xn bar.,00:35:41.590,00:35:45.300
"Then this thing is
approximately Gaussian and 0,1",00:35:45.300,00:35:51.130
if the coin is fair.,00:35:51.130,00:35:52.270
"Otherwise, I'm going to have
a mean which is not zero here.",00:35:56.150,00:36:01.120
"If the coin is something else,
whatever I get here, right?",00:36:01.120,00:36:04.730
"Let's just write
it for one second.",00:36:07.772,00:36:09.230
Let's do it.,00:36:23.520,00:36:25.010
"So what is the
distribution of this if p--",00:36:25.010,00:36:27.510
so that's p is equal to 0.5.,00:36:27.510,00:36:33.380
OK?,00:36:33.380,00:36:33.930
"Now if p is equal to 0.6,
then this thing is just, well,",00:36:33.930,00:36:39.910
"I know that this is equal
to square root of n xn",00:36:39.910,00:36:43.660
"bar minus 0.6,
divided by xn bar 1",00:36:43.660,00:36:52.140
"minus xn in the bar
squared root, plus--",00:36:52.140,00:36:55.740
"well, now the difference.",00:36:55.740,00:36:57.050
"Is So square root
of n, 0.6 minus",00:36:57.050,00:37:00.710
"0.5, divided by square root of
xn bar 1 minus xn bar, right?",00:37:00.710,00:37:07.520
"Now if p is equal to 0.6,
then this guy is n 0,1,",00:37:07.520,00:37:13.790
"but this guy is
something different.",00:37:13.790,00:37:17.950
"This is just a number that
depends on square root of n.",00:37:17.950,00:37:22.155
It's actually pretty large.,00:37:22.155,00:37:24.130
"So if I want to use the
fact that this guy has",00:37:24.130,00:37:28.620
"a normal distribution, I need
to plug-in the true value here.",00:37:28.620,00:37:33.650
"Now, the implicit question
that I got was the following.",00:37:33.650,00:37:38.630
"It says, well, if you know
what p is, then what's",00:37:38.630,00:37:43.630
actually true is also this.,00:37:43.630,00:37:46.600
"If p is equal to
0.5, then since I",00:37:46.600,00:37:51.450
"know that root n xn bar minus
p divided by square root of p 1",00:37:51.450,00:37:57.180
"minus p is some n
0, 1, it's also true",00:37:57.180,00:38:01.590
"that square root of
n xn bar minus 0.5",00:38:01.590,00:38:06.570
"divided by square root of 0.5
1 minus 0.5 is n 0,1, right?",00:38:06.570,00:38:14.940
I know what p is.,00:38:14.940,00:38:15.750
"I'm just going to
make it appear.",00:38:15.750,00:38:18.620
OK.,00:38:18.620,00:38:19.460
"And so, what's actually
nice about this particular",00:38:19.460,00:38:22.100
"[INAUDIBLE] experiment is that
I can check if my assumption is",00:38:22.100,00:38:27.460
"valid by checking
whether I'm actually--",00:38:27.460,00:38:31.386
"so what I'm going
to do right now",00:38:31.386,00:38:32.760
"is check whether this is likely
to be a Gaussian or not, right?",00:38:32.760,00:38:36.697
"And there's two ways
I can violate it.",00:38:36.697,00:38:38.280
"By violating mean, but also
by violating the variance.",00:38:38.280,00:38:42.496
"And here, what I did
in the first case,",00:38:42.496,00:38:44.120
"I said, well I'm not allowing
you to check whether you've",00:38:44.120,00:38:46.340
violated the variance.,00:38:46.340,00:38:47.040
"I'm just plugging whatever
variance you're getting.",00:38:47.040,00:38:49.340
"Whereas here, I'm
saying, well, there's",00:38:49.340,00:38:51.110
two ways you can violate it.,00:38:51.110,00:38:52.460
"And I'm just going to
factor everything in.",00:38:52.460,00:38:55.430
"So now I can
plug-in this number.",00:38:55.430,00:38:58.700
So this is 80.,00:38:58.700,00:39:00.146
This is 0.68.,00:39:00.146,00:39:02.440
So I can compute all this stuff.,00:39:02.440,00:39:04.210
"I can compute all this
stuff here as well.",00:39:04.210,00:39:06.910
"And what I get in this
case, if I put the xn bar 1,",00:39:06.910,00:39:10.210
"I get 3.45, OK?",00:39:10.210,00:39:15.160
"And now I claim
that this makes it",00:39:15.160,00:39:17.120
"reasonable to reject
the hypothesis that p",00:39:17.120,00:39:19.430
is equal to 0.5.,00:39:19.430,00:39:21.790
Can somebody tell me why?,00:39:21.790,00:39:22.900
STUDENT: It's pretty big.,00:39:27.819,00:39:28.860
"PROFESSOR: Yeah,
3 is pretty big.",00:39:28.860,00:39:30.235
So it's very unlikely.,00:39:30.235,00:39:31.510
"So this number that
I should see should",00:39:31.510,00:39:33.730
"look like the number I would get
if I asked a computer to draw",00:39:33.730,00:39:39.460
one random Gaussian for me.,00:39:39.460,00:39:42.960
"This number, when I draw
one random Gaussian,",00:39:42.960,00:39:45.250
"is actually a number with
99.9% this number will",00:39:45.250,00:39:49.510
be between negative 3 and 3.,00:39:49.510,00:39:52.700
"With 78% it's going to be
between negative 2 and 2.",00:39:52.700,00:39:55.540
68% is between minus 1 and 1.,00:40:01.990,00:40:04.410
"And with like 90% it's

little bit smaller",00:42:32.230,00:42:34.700

"it seem that our result was less
likely than it actually was.",00:42:45.074,00:42:50.014
PROFESSOR: That's correct.,00:43:00.450,00:43:03.490

"I didn't want to plug-in
the p everywhere,",00:43:05.790,00:43:07.540

"That's for sure, OK?",00:43:09.670,00:43:11.010
So let's agree on that.,00:43:11.010,00:43:12.205

the number a little bigger.",00:43:12.205,00:43:15.022

the square root of 80 is.",00:43:20.760,00:43:23.040

"I can make the same
cartoon picture with 3.22.",00:43:49.970,00:43:55.462

"This is definitely
more accurate.",00:43:56.170,00:43:57.370

confused message, OK?",00:43:58.536,00:44:02.350

example that you can think of.",00:44:02.850,00:44:07.770

"Still in the realm of the
central limit theorem.",00:44:11.520,00:44:17.310
I get 13 heads rather than 15.,00:44:17.310,00:44:23.910
"So I'm actually much closer
to being exactly at half.",00:44:23.910,00:44:27.127
"So let's see if this
is actually going",00:44:27.127,00:44:28.710
to give me a plausible value.,00:44:28.710,00:44:29.918
So I get 0.33 in average.,00:44:32.580,00:44:34.830
"If the truth was 0.5, I would
get something like 0.77.",00:44:34.830,00:44:40.950
"And now I claim that 0.77
is a plausible realization",00:44:40.950,00:44:44.700
"for some standard Gaussian, OK?",00:44:44.700,00:44:46.950
"Now, 0.77 is going to
look like it's here.",00:44:46.950,00:44:49.620
"So that could very well
be something that just",00:44:55.130,00:44:57.830
comes because of randomness.,00:44:57.830,00:44:59.420

think about it.",00:44:59.420,00:45:01.860

expecting 15, you saw 13,",00:45:01.860,00:45:06.740

the account of randomness.",00:45:06.740,00:45:09.479

question is going to be,",00:45:09.479,00:45:11.270
where do I draw the line?,00:45:11.270,00:45:12.770
Right?,00:45:12.770,00:45:13.760
Is 12 the right number?,00:45:13.760,00:45:15.740
Is 11?,00:45:15.740,00:45:16.840
Is 10?,00:45:16.840,00:45:17.570
What is it?,00:45:17.570,00:45:18.070

it's whatever you want to be.",00:45:21.690,00:45:24.770
"The problem it's hard to
think on the scale, right?",00:45:24.770,00:45:28.250
"What does it mean to
think on the scale?",00:45:28.250,00:45:30.332
"If I can't think
in this scale, I'm",00:45:30.332,00:45:31.790

the scale of 80 of them.",00:45:31.790,00:45:33.950

the scale of running 100 coin",00:45:33.950,00:45:38.390
flips.,00:45:38.390,00:45:39.170

have a new problem,",00:45:43.004,00:45:44.420

new skill in mind.",00:45:44.420,00:45:45.961

statistical analysis,",00:45:47.660,00:45:50.840

to have in mind",00:46:07.070,00:46:09.050

That's all you need to know.,00:46:14.014,00:46:15.180

0.77 is not this one,",00:46:18.880,00:46:21.760
"because it was
actually negative 0.77.",00:46:21.760,00:46:26.860
So this one.,00:46:26.860,00:46:28.660
OK.,00:46:28.660,00:46:29.160
"So I can be on the right or
I can be on the left of zero.",00:46:29.160,00:46:34.460
But they are still plausible.,00:46:34.460,00:46:36.030

actually have in mind",00:46:36.030,00:46:40.000
"all the values that are

it to just one question.",00:47:31.530,00:47:33.950
"So forget about
everything we just said.",00:47:33.950,00:47:36.350

when do you decide",00:47:36.350,00:47:38.240
"that a number is too large
to be reasonably drawn",00:47:38.240,00:47:43.010
from a Gaussian?,00:47:43.010,00:47:44.790
And this number is 2 or 1.96.,00:47:44.790,00:47:50.190
"And that's basically the number
that you get from this quintel.",00:47:50.190,00:47:53.010
"We've seen the
1.96 before, right?",00:47:53.010,00:47:55.560
"It's actually q alpha over 2,
where alpha is equal to 5%.",00:47:55.560,00:47:59.920
That's a quintel of a Gaussian.,00:47:59.920,00:48:01.620
"So actually, what we
do is we map it again.",00:48:01.620,00:48:05.130
So are now at the Gaussians.,00:48:05.130,00:48:06.300
"And then we map it again
into some probabilities,",00:48:06.300,00:48:08.380
"which is the probability of
being farther than this thing.",00:48:08.380,00:48:10.796

we can think.",00:48:10.796,00:48:12.460
"Probability is something
that quantifies my error.",00:48:12.460,00:48:15.060
"And the question is
what percentage of error",00:48:15.060,00:48:17.220
am I willing to tolerate.,00:48:17.220,00:48:18.300
"And if I tell you
5%, that's something",00:48:18.300,00:48:20.310
you can really envision.,00:48:20.310,00:48:21.570
"What it means is that if I
were to do this test a million",00:48:21.570,00:48:24.750
"times, 5% of the time
I would expose myself",00:48:24.750,00:48:28.380
to making a mistake.,00:48:28.380,00:48:30.400
All right.,00:48:30.400,00:48:30.900
That's all it would say.,00:48:30.900,00:48:31.950
"If you said, well, I don't
want to account for 5%,",00:48:31.950,00:48:36.790
"maybe I want 1%, then you
have to move from 1.94 to 2.5.",00:48:36.790,00:48:42.280

at I want 0.01%,",00:48:42.280,00:48:44.710
"then you have to move to
an even larger number.",00:48:44.710,00:48:47.180
So it depends.,00:48:47.180,00:48:48.100
"But stating this
number 1%, 5%, 10%",00:48:48.100,00:48:51.610
"is much easier than seeing those
numbers 1.96, 2.5, et cetera.",00:48:51.610,00:48:57.380

everything back on the scale.",00:48:57.380,00:49:00.370

again, as we said,",00:49:01.480,00:49:03.190

the coin is unfair.",00:49:03.190,00:49:05.720

the coin is unfair.",00:49:05.720,00:49:08.260

evidence to say that.",00:49:08.260,00:49:10.330

your question about,",00:49:10.330,00:49:12.580

the fact that we're",00:49:12.580,00:49:17.420

we can probably all agree",00:49:35.380,00:49:37.880

There's nothing in there.,00:49:48.959,00:49:50.000
Why would you?,00:49:50.000,00:49:51.060
"I mean, if I let you
get away with it,",00:49:51.060,00:49:53.060
you would put corn syrup.,00:49:53.060,00:49:55.810
It's cheaper.,00:49:55.810,00:49:58.720
OK.,00:49:58.720,00:49:59.840
So now let's move on to math.,00:49:59.840,00:50:01.171
All right.,00:50:01.171,00:50:01.670
"So when I started
doing mathematics,",00:50:01.670,00:50:04.460
"I'm going to have to talk
about random variables",00:50:04.460,00:50:06.690
and statistical models.,00:50:06.690,00:50:08.270
"And here, there is actually
a very simple thing,",00:50:08.270,00:50:13.110
"which actually goes
back to this picture.",00:50:13.110,00:50:15.800
"A test is really asking
me if my parameter",00:50:18.950,00:50:27.230
"is in some region
of the parameter set",00:50:27.230,00:50:28.850
"or another region of the
parameter set, right?",00:50:28.850,00:50:30.766
Yes/no.,00:50:30.766,00:50:32.000
"And so, what I'm going to be
given is a sample, x1, xn.",00:50:32.000,00:50:37.490
I have a model.,00:50:37.490,00:50:38.120
"And again, those can be
braces depending on the day.",00:50:41.830,00:50:46.460
"And so, now I'm going to give
myself theta 0 and theta 1",00:50:46.460,00:50:54.670
to this joint subset.,00:50:54.670,00:50:55.660
OK.,00:50:58.590,00:51:01.170
"So capital theta
here is the space",00:51:01.170,00:51:02.840
in which my parameter can live.,00:51:02.840,00:51:05.200
"To make two disjoint
subsets, I could just",00:51:05.200,00:51:06.950
"split this guy in half, right?",00:51:06.950,00:51:11.356
"I'm going to say, well, maybe
it's this guy and this guy.",00:51:11.356,00:51:13.730
OK.,00:51:13.730,00:51:14.230
So this is theta 0.,00:51:14.230,00:51:16.250
And this is theta 1.,00:51:16.250,00:51:18.830
"What it means when I split
those two guys, in test,",00:51:18.830,00:51:22.840
"I'm actually going to focus
only on theta 0 or theta 1.",00:51:22.840,00:51:25.510
"And so, it means that
a priori I've already",00:51:25.510,00:51:28.010
"removed all the possibilities
of theta being in this region.",00:51:28.010,00:51:32.240
What does it mean?,00:51:32.240,00:51:33.540
"Go back to the
example of runners.",00:51:33.540,00:51:37.910
"This region here for
the Cherry Blossom Run",00:51:37.910,00:51:41.180
"is the set of parameters,
where mu was larger",00:51:41.180,00:51:44.420
"than 103.5, right?",00:51:44.420,00:51:47.354
We removed that.,00:51:47.354,00:51:48.020
"We didn't even consider
this possibility.",00:51:48.020,00:51:49.880
We said either it's less--,00:51:49.880,00:51:52.820
sorry.,00:51:52.820,00:51:53.320
That's mu equal to 103.5.,00:51:53.320,00:51:55.860
"And this was mu
less than 103.5, OK?",00:51:55.860,00:51:59.770
"But these guys were like
if it happens, it happens.",00:51:59.770,00:52:03.950
"I'm not making any
statement about that case.",00:52:03.950,00:52:06.980
All right?,00:52:06.980,00:52:07.520
So now I take those two subsets.,00:52:07.520,00:52:09.565
"And now I'm going to give
them two different names,",00:52:09.565,00:52:11.690
"because they're going to
have an asymmetric role.",00:52:11.690,00:52:15.050
h0 is the null hypothesis.,00:52:15.050,00:52:18.710
"And h1 is the
alternative hypothesis.",00:52:18.710,00:52:23.630
h0 is the status quo.,00:52:23.630,00:52:27.030
"h1 is what is
considered typically",00:52:27.030,00:52:29.560
as scientific discovery.,00:52:29.560,00:52:32.140
"So if you're a regulator,
you're going to push towards h0.",00:52:32.140,00:52:36.550
"If you're a scientist, you're
going to push towards h1.",00:52:36.550,00:52:39.832
"If you're a
pharmaceutical company,",00:52:39.832,00:52:41.290
you're going to push towards h1.,00:52:41.290,00:52:42.990
OK?,00:52:42.990,00:52:43.900
"And so, depending on whether you
want to be conservative-- oh,",00:52:43.900,00:52:47.410
"I can find evidence
in a lot of data.",00:52:47.410,00:52:49.272
"As soon as you give
me three data points,",00:52:49.272,00:52:50.980
"I'm going to be able
to find evidence.",00:52:50.980,00:52:52.563
"That means I'm going to
tend to say, oh, it's h1.",00:52:52.563,00:52:55.000
"But if you say you
need a lot of data",00:52:55.000,00:52:58.010
"before you can actually move
away from the status quo,",00:52:58.010,00:53:00.260
"that's age h0, OK?",00:53:00.260,00:53:01.870
"So think of h0 as
being status quo,",00:53:01.870,00:53:03.940
"h1 being some discovery that
goes against the status quo.",00:53:03.940,00:53:08.480
All right?,00:53:08.480,00:53:08.980
"So if we believe that
the truth theta is either",00:53:08.980,00:53:12.310
"in one of those, what we say is
we want to test h0 against h1.",00:53:12.310,00:53:17.330
OK.,00:53:17.330,00:53:17.830
This is actually wording.,00:53:17.830,00:53:19.790
"So remember, because this
is how your questions are",00:53:19.790,00:53:22.360
going to be formulated.,00:53:22.360,00:53:23.770
"And this is how you want
to probably communicate",00:53:23.770,00:53:26.320
as a statistician.,00:53:26.320,00:53:27.730
"So you're going to
say I have the null",00:53:27.730,00:53:29.347
and I have an alternative.,00:53:29.347,00:53:30.430
I want to test h0 against h1.,00:53:30.430,00:53:32.830
"I want to test the
null hypothesis",00:53:32.830,00:53:34.480
"against the alternative
hypothesis, OK?",00:53:34.480,00:53:36.220
"Now, the two hypotheses I
forgot to say are actually this.",00:53:39.540,00:53:42.590
"h0 is that the theta
belongs to theta 0.",00:53:42.590,00:53:46.710
"And h1 is that it theta
belongs to theta 1.",00:53:46.710,00:53:50.911
OK.,00:53:50.911,00:53:51.410
"So here, for example,
theta was mu.",00:53:51.410,00:53:53.280
And that was mu equal to 103.5.,00:53:53.280,00:53:57.320
And this was mu less than 103.5.,00:53:57.320,00:54:01.530
OK?,00:54:01.530,00:54:02.480
"So typically, they're not going
to look like thetas and things",00:54:02.480,00:54:06.360
like that.,00:54:06.360,00:54:06.860
"They're going to look like very
simple things, where you take",00:54:06.860,00:54:09.140
"your usual notation for
your usual parameter",00:54:09.140,00:54:11.180
"and you just say in mathematical
terms what relationship this",00:54:11.180,00:54:15.060
"should be satisfying, right?",00:54:15.060,00:54:16.910
"For example, in
the drug example,",00:54:16.910,00:54:18.320
"that would be mu drug
is equal to mu control.",00:54:18.320,00:54:25.150
"And here, that would be mu
drug less than mu control.",00:54:25.150,00:54:30.380
"The number of
expectorations for people",00:54:30.380,00:54:34.150
"who take the drug
for the cough syrup",00:54:34.150,00:54:35.800
"is less than the number
of expectoration of people",00:54:35.800,00:54:38.300
"who take the corn syrup, OK?",00:54:38.300,00:54:42.990
So now what we want to do.,00:54:42.990,00:54:45.090
"We've set up our
hypothesis testing problem.",00:54:47.890,00:54:51.060
You're a scientist.,00:54:51.060,00:54:52.260
You've set up your problem.,00:54:52.260,00:54:55.020
"Now what you're going
to do is collect data.",00:54:55.020,00:54:58.170
"And what you're going to
try to find on this data",00:54:58.170,00:55:00.660
is evidence against h0.,00:55:00.660,00:55:04.050
"And the alternative
is going to guide you",00:55:04.050,00:55:06.060
"into which direction
you should be looking",00:55:06.060,00:55:08.010
for evidence against this guy.,00:55:08.010,00:55:10.200
All right?,00:55:10.200,00:55:11.290
"And so, of course, the
narrower the alternative,",00:55:11.290,00:55:13.820
"the easier it is for
you, because you just",00:55:13.820,00:55:15.570
"have to look at the one
possible candidate, right?",00:55:15.570,00:55:19.410
"But typically, h1 is a
big group, like less than.",00:55:19.410,00:55:22.650
"Nobody tells you it's
either it's 103.5 and 103.",00:55:22.650,00:55:27.990
"People tell you it's either
103.5 or less than 103.5.",00:55:27.990,00:55:32.460
OK.,00:55:32.460,00:55:33.280
"And so, what we want to do is
to decide whether we reject h0.",00:55:33.280,00:55:37.330
"So we look for evidence
against h0 in the data, OK?",00:55:37.330,00:55:40.480
"So as I said, h0 and h1 do
not play a symmetric role.",00:55:44.320,00:55:48.880
"It's very important to
know which one you're",00:55:48.880,00:55:51.700
"going to place as h0
and which one you're",00:55:51.700,00:55:53.465
going to place at h1.,00:55:53.465,00:55:54.340
"If it's a close
call, you're always",00:55:59.260,00:56:01.480
"going to side with h0, OK?",00:56:01.480,00:56:04.000
"So you have to be
careful about those.",00:56:04.000,00:56:05.860
"You have to keep that
in mind that if it's",00:56:05.860,00:56:07.609
"a close call, if data does
not carry a lot of evidence,",00:56:07.609,00:56:10.410
you're going to side with h0.,00:56:10.410,00:56:12.280
"And so, you're actually
never saying that h0 is true.",00:56:12.280,00:56:15.700
"You're just saying I did not
find evidence against h0.",00:56:15.700,00:56:18.430
You don't say I accept that h0.,00:56:18.430,00:56:21.400
You say I failed to reject h0.,00:56:21.400,00:56:25.590
OK.,00:56:25.590,00:56:26.090
"And so one of the
things that you",00:56:26.090,00:56:28.189
"want to keep in mind
when you're doing this",00:56:28.189,00:56:29.980
"is this innocent
until proven guilty.",00:56:29.980,00:56:32.960
"So if you come from a
country, like America,",00:56:32.960,00:56:37.010
there's such a thing.,00:56:37.010,00:56:38.090
"And in particular,
lack of evidence",00:56:38.090,00:56:41.270
"does not mean that you
are not guilty, all right?",00:56:41.270,00:56:45.410
OJ Simpson was found not guilty.,00:56:45.410,00:56:47.720
"It was not found innocent, OK?",00:56:47.720,00:56:50.270
"And so, this is
basically what happens",00:56:50.270,00:56:52.100
"is like the prosecutor
brings their evidence.",00:56:52.100,00:56:55.760
"And then the jury has
to decide whether they",00:56:55.760,00:56:58.940
"were convinced that this
person was guilty of anything.",00:56:58.940,00:57:07.400
"And the question is, do
you have enough evidence?",00:57:07.400,00:57:11.820
"But if you don't
have evidence, it's",00:57:11.820,00:57:13.550
"not the burden of the defender
to prove that they're innocent.",00:57:13.550,00:57:17.257
Nobody's proving their innocent.,00:57:17.257,00:57:18.590
"I mean, sometimes it helps.",00:57:18.590,00:57:20.120
"But you just have to make
sure that there's not",00:57:20.120,00:57:22.160
"enough evidence against you, OK?",00:57:22.160,00:57:24.560
"And that's basically
what it's doing.",00:57:24.560,00:57:26.370
You're h0 until proven h1.,00:57:26.370,00:57:28.980
So how are we going to do this?,00:57:31.529,00:57:32.820
"Well, as I said, the
role of estimators",00:57:32.820,00:57:37.200
"in hypothesis testing is played
by something called tests.",00:57:37.200,00:57:40.460
And a test is a statistic.,00:57:40.460,00:57:42.300
"Can somebody remind me
what a statistic is?",00:57:42.300,00:57:44.340
Yep?,00:57:47.190,00:57:48.140
STUDENT: The measure [INAUDIBLE],00:57:48.140,00:57:50.050
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
actually just one step more.",00:57:50.050,00:57:53.290
"So it's a function
of the observations.",00:57:53.290,00:57:54.940
"And we require it
to be measurable.",00:57:54.940,00:57:56.734
"And as a rule of
thumb, measurable",00:57:56.734,00:57:58.150
"means if I give you data, you
can actually compute it, OK?",00:57:58.150,00:58:00.567
"If you don't see a
[INAUDIBLE] or an [INAUDIBLE],,",00:58:00.567,00:58:02.649
"you don't have to
think about it.",00:58:02.649,00:58:04.140
All right.,00:58:04.140,00:58:04.780
"And so, what we do is
we just have this test.",00:58:08.950,00:58:11.590
"But now I'm actually
asking only from this test",00:58:11.590,00:58:14.590
"a yes/no answer, which I
can code as 0, 1, right?",00:58:14.590,00:58:18.280
"So as a rule of thumb, you
say that, well, the test",00:58:18.280,00:58:21.640
is equal to 0 then h0.,00:58:21.640,00:58:23.140
The test is equal to 1 at h1.,00:58:23.140,00:58:25.490
"And as we said, is that
if the test is equal to 0,",00:58:25.490,00:58:27.604
"it doesn't mean
that a 0 is truth.",00:58:27.604,00:58:29.020
"It means that I
feel to rejected h0.",00:58:29.020,00:58:31.060
"And if the test is
equal to 1, I reject h0.",00:58:31.060,00:58:33.390
So I have two possibilities.,00:58:36.510,00:58:38.750
I look at my data.,00:58:38.750,00:58:39.640
I turn it into a yes/no answer.,00:58:39.640,00:58:41.800
"And yes/no answer is
really h0 or h1, OK?",00:58:41.800,00:58:45.310
"Which one is the most
likely basically.",00:58:45.310,00:58:49.260
All right.,00:58:49.260,00:58:50.720
"So in the coin flip
example, our test statistic",00:58:50.720,00:58:57.530
"is actually something
that takes value 0, 1.",00:58:57.530,00:59:00.850
"And anything, any function
that takes value at 0,",00:59:00.850,00:59:04.600
"1 is an indicator function, OK?",00:59:04.600,00:59:07.030
"So an indicator function
is just a function.",00:59:07.030,00:59:11.507
"So there's many ways
you can write it.",00:59:11.507,00:59:13.090
So it's a 1 with a double bar.,00:59:18.760,00:59:20.440
"If you aren't
comfortable with this,",00:59:20.440,00:59:21.940
"it's totally OK to write i
of something, like i of a.",00:59:21.940,00:59:27.650
OK.,00:59:27.650,00:59:28.534
And that's what?,00:59:28.534,00:59:29.200
"So a, here, is a statement,
like an inequality, an equality,",00:59:29.200,00:59:34.270
"some mathematical statement, OK?",00:59:34.270,00:59:38.600
Or not mathematical.,00:59:38.600,00:59:39.700
"I mean, ""a"" can be, you know,
my grandma is 20 years old, OK?",00:59:39.700,00:59:43.430
"And so, this is basically 1 if
a is true, and 0 if a is false.",00:59:43.430,00:59:50.390
"That's the way you
want to think about it.",00:59:54.510,00:59:56.260
"This function takes only
two values, and that's it.",01:00:02.840,01:00:05.420
"So here's the
example that we had.",01:00:10.290,01:00:12.080
"We looked at whether
the standardized xn",01:00:12.080,01:00:17.330
"bar, the one that actually
is approximately n 0,1",01:00:17.330,01:00:20.220
"was larger than something
in absolute value,",01:00:20.220,01:00:22.590
"either very large or
very small, but negative.",01:00:22.590,01:00:27.550
I'm going back to this picture.,01:00:27.550,01:00:29.020
"We wanted to know
if this guy was",01:00:29.020,01:00:31.270
"either to the left of something
or to the right of something,",01:00:31.270,01:00:35.660
right?,01:00:35.660,01:00:36.160
Was it in these regions?,01:00:36.160,01:00:37.642
"Now this indicator, I can view
this as a function of x bar.",01:00:42.352,01:00:49.250
"What it does, it really
splits the possible values",01:00:49.250,01:00:52.100
"of x bar, which is just
a real number, right?",01:00:52.100,01:00:54.500
In two groups.,01:00:54.500,01:00:56.180
"The groups on which they
lead to a value, which is 1.",01:00:56.180,01:00:59.030
"And the groups on
which they lead",01:00:59.030,01:01:00.590
"to value, which is 0, right?",01:01:00.590,01:01:02.270
"So what it does is that
I can actually think",01:01:02.270,01:01:05.420
"of it as the real line, x bar.",01:01:05.420,01:01:09.140
"And there's basically
some values here,",01:01:09.140,01:01:13.010
where I'm going to get a 1.,01:01:13.010,01:01:14.927
Maybe I'm going to get a 0 here.,01:01:14.927,01:01:16.260
Maybe I'm going to get a 0.,01:01:16.260,01:01:17.670
Maybe I'm going to get a 1.,01:01:17.670,01:01:18.840
"I'm just splitting all
possible values of x bar.",01:01:18.840,01:01:22.470
"And I see whether to spit
out the side which is 0",01:01:22.470,01:01:25.350
or which is 1.,01:01:25.350,01:01:26.880
"In this case, it's
not clear, right?",01:01:26.880,01:01:29.471
"I mean, the function
is very nonlinear.",01:01:29.471,01:01:31.095
"It's x bar minus 0.5 divided
by the square root of x bar 1",01:01:31.095,01:01:34.530
minus x bar.,01:01:34.530,01:01:35.532
"If we put the p in
the denominator,",01:01:35.532,01:01:36.990
that would be clear.,01:01:36.990,01:01:38.070
"That would just be exactly
something that looks like this.",01:01:38.070,01:01:40.530
The function would be like this.,01:01:45.427,01:01:46.760
"It would be 1 if it's
smaller than some value.",01:01:46.760,01:01:49.370
"Less than 0 if it's
in between two values.",01:01:49.370,01:01:52.580
And then 1 again.,01:01:52.580,01:01:54.220
"So that's psi, OK?",01:01:54.220,01:02:00.730
"So this is 1, right?",01:02:00.730,01:02:02.470
This is 1.,01:02:02.470,01:02:03.130
And this is 0.,01:02:03.130,01:02:04.540
"So if x bar is too small
or if x bar is too large,",01:02:04.540,01:02:07.390
then I'm getting a value 1.,01:02:07.390,01:02:09.590
"But if it's somewhere in
between, I'm getting a value 0.",01:02:09.590,01:02:12.640
"Now, if I have this
weird function,",01:02:12.640,01:02:14.410
"it's not clear
how this happened.",01:02:14.410,01:02:18.090
"So the picture
here that I get is",01:02:18.090,01:02:20.434
"that I have a weird
non-linear function, right?",01:02:20.434,01:02:27.080
So that's x bar.,01:02:27.080,01:02:28.420
"That's square root
of n x bar n 0.5",01:02:28.420,01:02:32.270
"divided by the square root of
x bar n 1 minus x bar n, right?",01:02:32.270,01:02:36.980
That's this function.,01:02:36.980,01:02:38.210
"A priori, I have no idea what
this function looks like.",01:02:38.210,01:02:40.890
"We can probably
analyze this function,",01:02:43.650,01:02:45.320
but let's pretend we don't know.,01:02:45.320,01:02:46.740
"So it's like some
crazy stuff like this.",01:02:46.740,01:02:49.680
"And all I'm asking is
whether in absolute value",01:02:49.680,01:02:56.320
"it's larger than c, which means
that is this function larger",01:02:56.320,01:02:59.510
than c or less than minus c?,01:02:59.510,01:03:01.383
"The intervals on which
I'm going to say 1",01:03:05.020,01:03:07.100
"are this guy, this guy,
this guy, and this guy.",01:03:07.100,01:03:17.821
OK.,01:03:17.821,01:03:18.320
"And everywhere
else, I'm seeing 0.",01:03:18.320,01:03:20.897
Everybody agree with this?,01:03:20.897,01:03:21.980
This is what I'm doing.,01:03:21.980,01:03:24.930
"Now of course, it's
probably easier for you",01:03:24.930,01:03:27.370
"to just package it into
this nice thing that's",01:03:27.370,01:03:29.350
"just either larger than
c, an absolute value,",01:03:29.350,01:03:31.602
"or less Than C. I want to
have to plot this function.",01:03:31.602,01:03:33.810
"In practice, you don't have to.",01:03:33.810,01:03:36.950
"Now, this is where I
am actually claiming.",01:03:36.950,01:03:40.050
"So here, I actually
defined to you a test.",01:03:40.050,01:03:42.200
"And I promised, starting
this lecture, by saying,",01:03:42.200,01:03:44.500
"oh, now we're going
to do something better",01:03:44.500,01:03:46.250
than computing the averages.,01:03:46.250,01:03:47.880
"Now I'm telling you it's
just computing an average.",01:03:47.880,01:03:50.450
"And the thing is
the test is not just",01:03:50.450,01:03:52.910
the specification of this x bar.,01:03:52.910,01:03:54.830
"It's also the specification
of this constant c.",01:03:54.830,01:03:57.901
All right?,01:03:57.901,01:03:58.400
"And the constant c
was exactly where",01:03:58.400,01:04:02.270
"our belief about what a large
value for a Gaussian is.",01:04:02.270,01:04:07.360
That's exactly where it came in.,01:04:07.360,01:04:09.200
"So this choice of c is
basically a threshold",01:04:09.200,01:04:12.500
"at which we decide above
this threshold this isn't",01:04:12.500,01:04:15.320
likely to come from a Gaussian.,01:04:15.320,01:04:17.104
"Below this threshold
we decide that it's",01:04:17.104,01:04:18.770
likely to come from a Gaussian.,01:04:18.770,01:04:20.660
"So we have to choose what
this threshold is based",01:04:20.660,01:04:24.200
on what we think likely means.,01:04:24.200,01:04:26.750
"Just a little bit
more of those things.",01:04:34.420,01:04:37.490
"So now we're going to
have to characterize",01:04:37.490,01:04:39.520
"what makes a good test, right?",01:04:39.520,01:04:43.030
"Well, I'll come back
to it in a second.",01:04:43.030,01:04:44.770
"But you could have a test
that says reject all the time.",01:04:44.770,01:04:48.755
"And that's going to
be bad test, right?",01:04:48.755,01:04:50.380
"The FDA is not
implementing a test",01:04:50.380,01:04:52.120
"that says, yes all drugs work,
now let's just go to Aruba, OK?",01:04:52.120,01:04:56.440
"So people are trying
to have something that",01:04:56.440,01:04:59.650
tries to work all the time.,01:04:59.650,01:05:01.560
"Now FDA's not either
saying, let's just",01:05:01.560,01:05:03.700
"say that no drugs work, and
let's go to Aruba, all right?",01:05:03.700,01:05:07.340
"They're just trying
to say the right thing",01:05:07.340,01:05:09.880
as often as possible.,01:05:09.880,01:05:11.180
"And so, we're going to
have to measure this.",01:05:11.180,01:05:13.300
"So the things that are
associated to a test",01:05:13.300,01:05:15.790
are the rejection region.,01:05:15.790,01:05:17.440
"And if you look at this
x in en, such that psi",01:05:17.440,01:05:21.550
"of x is equal to 1, this is
exactly this guy that I drew.",01:05:21.550,01:05:25.420
"So here, I summarized
the values of the sample",01:05:29.024,01:05:30.940
into their average.,01:05:30.940,01:05:32.460
"But the values of the
sample that I collect",01:05:32.460,01:05:35.080
will lead to a test that says 1.,01:05:35.080,01:05:38.691
All right?,01:05:38.691,01:05:39.190
So this is the rejection region.,01:05:39.190,01:05:40.610
"If I collect a data point,
technically I have--",01:05:40.610,01:05:43.990
"so I have e to the n, which
is a big space like this.",01:05:43.990,01:05:51.250
So that's e to the n.,01:05:51.250,01:05:52.540
"Think of it as being
the space of xn bars.",01:05:52.540,01:05:55.150
"And I have a function that
takes only value 0, 1.",01:05:55.150,01:05:59.200
"So I can decompose
it into this part",01:05:59.200,01:06:01.962
"where it takes value 0 and the
part where it takes value 1.",01:06:01.962,01:06:04.420
"And those can be super
complicated, right?",01:06:04.420,01:06:06.740
Can have a thing like this.,01:06:06.740,01:06:07.880
"Can have some weird little
islands where it takes value 1.",01:06:07.880,01:06:11.990
"I can have some islands
where it's takes value 0.",01:06:11.990,01:06:14.090
"I can have some
weird stuff going on.",01:06:14.090,01:06:16.237
"But I can always partition
it into the value",01:06:16.237,01:06:18.070
"where it takes value 0 and the
value where it takes value 1.",01:06:18.070,01:06:20.570
"And the value where it takes
1, if psi is equal to 1,",01:06:20.570,01:06:25.530
"this is called the rejection
region of the plot, OK?",01:06:25.530,01:06:32.630
"So just the samples that
would lead me to rejecting.",01:06:32.630,01:06:37.810
"And notice that this is the
indicator of the rejection",01:06:37.810,01:06:42.460
region.,01:06:42.460,01:06:44.010
"The test is the indicator
of the rejection region.",01:06:44.010,01:06:48.190
"So there's two ways you can make
an error when there's a test.",01:06:48.190,01:06:52.530
"Either the truth is in h1, and
you're saying actually it's h1.",01:06:52.530,01:06:56.460
"Or the truth is in h1,
and you say it's h0.",01:06:56.460,01:06:59.310
"And that's how we build-in the
asymmetry between h0 and h1.",01:06:59.310,01:07:04.710
"We control only one
of the two errors.",01:07:04.710,01:07:06.480
"And we hope for the
best for the second one.",01:07:06.480,01:07:09.510
"So the type 1 error is
the one that says, well,",01:07:09.510,01:07:13.370
"if it is actually the
status quo, but a claim",01:07:13.370,01:07:16.640
"that there is a discovery--
if it's actually h0,",01:07:16.640,01:07:19.220
"but I claim that
I'm in h1, then I",01:07:19.220,01:07:21.700
admit I commit a type I error.,01:07:21.700,01:07:25.560
"And so the probability
of type I error",01:07:25.560,01:07:27.870
"is this function
alpha of psi, which",01:07:27.870,01:07:29.730
"is the probability of saying
that psi is equal to 1",01:07:29.730,01:07:34.920
when theta is in h0.,01:07:34.920,01:07:36.809
"Now, the problem is that
this is not just number,",01:07:36.809,01:07:38.850
"because theta is just like
moving all over h0, right?",01:07:38.850,01:07:41.790
"There's many values that
theta can be, right?",01:07:41.790,01:07:45.980
So theta is somewhere here.,01:07:45.980,01:07:48.500
"I erased it, OK.",01:07:52.854,01:07:53.520
All right.,01:07:59.120,01:08:00.335
"For simplicity, we're
going to think of theta",01:08:00.335,01:08:02.210
"as being mu and 103.5, OK?",01:08:02.210,01:08:07.980
"And so, I know that
this is theta 1.",01:08:07.980,01:08:11.720
"And just this point
here was theta 0, OK?",01:08:11.720,01:08:18.990
Agreed?,01:08:18.990,01:08:19.490
"This is with the
Cherry Blossom Run.",01:08:19.490,01:08:22.800
"Now, here in this case,
it's actually easy.",01:08:22.800,01:08:25.699
"I need to compute
this function alpha",01:08:25.699,01:08:27.240
"of psi, which maps theta in
theta 0 to p theta of psi",01:08:27.240,01:08:37.144
equals 1.,01:08:37.144,01:08:37.689
"So that's the probability that
I reject when theta is in h0.",01:08:37.689,01:08:40.682
"Then there's only one
of them to compute,",01:08:40.682,01:08:42.390
"because theta can only
take this one value.",01:08:42.390,01:08:44.220
So this is really 103.5.,01:08:44.220,01:08:46.840
OK.,01:08:46.840,01:08:47.340
"So that's the
probability that I reject",01:08:47.340,01:08:48.964
when the true mean was 103.5.,01:08:48.964,01:08:52.649
"Now, if I was testing whether--",01:08:52.649,01:08:54.870
"if h0 was this entire
guy here, all the",01:08:54.870,01:08:57.660
"values larger than
103.5, then I would",01:08:57.660,01:09:00.090
"have to compute this function
for all possible values",01:09:00.090,01:09:03.450
of the theta in there.,01:09:03.450,01:09:06.220
And guess what?,01:09:06.220,01:09:07.220
"The worst case is when
it's going to be here.",01:09:07.220,01:09:09.414
"Because it's so close
to the alternative",01:09:09.414,01:09:11.080
"that that's where I'm making
the most error possible.",01:09:11.080,01:09:15.149
"And then there's
the type 2 error,",01:09:15.149,01:09:17.550
"which is defined basically
in the symmetric ways.",01:09:17.550,01:09:22.200
"The function that maps
theta to the probability.",01:09:22.200,01:09:25.089
"So that's the probability
of type 2 errors.",01:09:25.089,01:09:26.880
"The probability that I
fail to reject h0, right?",01:09:26.880,01:09:30.330
"If psi is equal to 0,
I fail to reject h0.",01:09:30.330,01:09:34.080
"But that actually
came from h1, OK?",01:09:34.080,01:09:39.840
"So in this example, let's clear.",01:09:39.840,01:09:41.540
"If I'm here, like if
the true mean was 100,",01:09:41.540,01:09:45.629
"I'm looking at the probability
that the true mean is actually",01:09:45.629,01:09:48.170
"100, and I'm actually
saying it was 103.5.",01:09:48.170,01:09:51.569
Or it's not less than 103.5.,01:09:51.569,01:09:53.504
Yeah?,01:09:53.504,01:09:54.004
"STUDENT: I'm just still
confused by the notation.",01:09:54.004,01:09:56.045

OK.,01:10:09.450,01:10:10.220
"So that's just
the way you write.",01:10:10.220,01:10:14.690
"So that means that's a function
f that goes from, say, r r,",01:10:14.690,01:10:20.800
and that maps x to x squared.,01:10:20.800,01:10:25.381
OK.,01:10:25.381,01:10:25.880
"So here, I'm just saying
I don't have to consider",01:10:25.880,01:10:27.921
all possible values.,01:10:27.921,01:10:29.030
"I'm only considering
the values on theta 0.",01:10:29.030,01:10:32.540
I put r actually.,01:10:32.540,01:10:33.620
"I could restrict myself
to the interval 0, 1,",01:10:33.620,01:10:36.320
because those are probabilities.,01:10:36.320,01:10:38.160
"So it's just telling me
where my function comes from",01:10:38.160,01:10:41.090
and where my function goes to.,01:10:41.090,01:10:44.330
"And beta is a function, right?",01:10:44.330,01:10:47.240
"So beta psi of theta
is just the probability",01:10:47.240,01:10:52.990
that theta is equal to 1.,01:10:52.990,01:10:55.610
"And I could define
that for all thetas--",01:10:55.610,01:10:57.930
sorry.,01:10:57.930,01:10:58.430
"If psi is equal
to 0 in this case.",01:10:58.430,01:11:00.600
"And that could define
that for all thetas.",01:11:00.600,01:11:02.810
"But the only ones
that lead to an error",01:11:02.810,01:11:05.240
are the thetas that are in h1.,01:11:05.240,01:11:06.812
"I mean, I can define
this function.",01:11:06.812,01:11:08.270
"It's just not going to
correspond to an error, OK?",01:11:08.270,01:11:11.121
"And the power of a
test is the smallest--",01:11:13.930,01:11:18.960
"so the power is basically
1 minus an error.",01:11:18.960,01:11:22.101
"1 minus the probability
of an error.",01:11:22.101,01:11:23.600
"So it's the probability of
making a correct decision, OK?",01:11:23.600,01:11:27.324
"So it's the probability of
making a correct decision",01:11:27.324,01:11:29.490
"under h1, that's
what the power is.",01:11:29.490,01:11:31.830
"But again, this
could be a function.",01:11:31.830,01:11:34.830
"Because there's many
ways that can be in h1",01:11:34.830,01:11:36.900
"if h1 is an entire
set of numbers.",01:11:36.900,01:11:39.150
"For example, all the numbers
there are less than 103.5.",01:11:39.150,01:11:42.200
"And so, what I'm doing here when
I define the power of a test,",01:11:42.200,01:11:45.510
"I'm looking at the smallest
possible of those values, OK?",01:11:45.510,01:11:50.057
So I'm looking at this function.,01:11:50.057,01:11:51.390
"Maybe I should actually
expand a little more on this.",01:11:54.140,01:11:57.028
OK.,01:12:02.700,01:12:03.200
"So beta psi of theta is
the probability under theta",01:12:03.200,01:12:10.790
"that psi is equal to 0, right?",01:12:10.790,01:12:12.590
"That's the probability
in theta 1,",01:12:12.590,01:12:18.710
"which means then the
alternative, that they",01:12:18.710,01:12:21.110
feel to reject.,01:12:21.110,01:12:21.884
"And I really should,
because theta",01:12:21.884,01:12:23.300
"was actually in theta 1, OK?",01:12:23.300,01:12:25.520
"So this thing here is the
probability of type 2 error.",01:12:25.520,01:12:29.150
"Now, this is 1 minus the
probability that I did reject",01:12:29.150,01:12:34.560
and I should have rejected.,01:12:34.560,01:12:36.960
"That's just a little
off the complement.",01:12:36.960,01:12:39.830
"Because if psi is not equal
to 0, then it's equal to 1.",01:12:39.830,01:12:42.910
"So now if I rearrange
this, it tells me",01:12:42.910,01:12:44.620
"that the probability
that psi is equal to 1--",01:12:44.620,01:12:48.260
"this is actually 1
minus beta psi of theta.",01:12:48.260,01:12:50.100
"So that's true for
all thetas in theta 1.",01:12:54.440,01:12:57.110
"And what I'm saying
is, well, this",01:12:57.110,01:12:58.640
"is now a good thing, right?",01:12:58.640,01:13:00.904
"This number being
large is a good thing.",01:13:00.904,01:13:02.570
"It means I should have
rejected, and I rejected.",01:13:02.570,01:13:05.330
"I want this to happen
with large probability.",01:13:05.330,01:13:07.650
"And so, what I'm
going to look at",01:13:07.650,01:13:09.025
"is the most conservative
choice of this number, right?",01:13:09.025,01:13:11.894
"Rather than being
super optimistic",01:13:11.894,01:13:13.310
"and say, oh, but indeed if theta
was actually equal to zero,",01:13:13.310,01:13:16.970
"then I'm always going
to conclude that--",01:13:16.970,01:13:19.300
"I mean, if mu is equal to 0,
everybody runs in 0 seconds,",01:13:19.300,01:13:22.730
"then I with high
probability I'm actually",01:13:22.730,01:13:25.990
going to make no mistake.,01:13:25.990,01:13:27.770
"But really, I should look at
the worst possible case, OK?",01:13:27.770,01:13:30.920
"So what I'm looking
at is basically",01:13:30.920,01:13:32.900
"the smallest value it
can take on theta one",01:13:32.900,01:13:45.002
is called power of psi.,01:13:45.002,01:13:53.490
"Power of the test psi, OK?",01:13:53.490,01:13:55.850
"So that's the smallest
possible value it can take.",01:13:55.850,01:13:58.930
All right.,01:14:01.610,01:14:02.110
So I'm sorry.,01:14:02.110,01:14:02.651
"This is a lot of definitions
that you have to sink in.",01:14:02.651,01:14:05.310
And it's not super pleasant.,01:14:05.310,01:14:06.870
But that's what testing is.,01:14:06.870,01:14:09.180
There's a lot of jargon.,01:14:09.180,01:14:10.540
"Those are actually
fairly simple things.",01:14:10.540,01:14:12.440
"Just maybe you should
get a sheet for yourself.",01:14:12.440,01:14:14.460
"And say, these are the
new terms that I learned.",01:14:14.460,01:14:17.400
"What is their test,
rejection region?",01:14:17.400,01:14:19.584
"Probably of type
I error, probably",01:14:19.584,01:14:21.000
"of type 2 error, and power.",01:14:21.000,01:14:22.740
"Just make sure you know
what those guys are.",01:14:22.740,01:14:23.910
Oh.,01:14:23.910,01:14:24.410
"And null and alternative
hypothesis, OK?",01:14:24.410,01:14:27.162
"And once you know
all these things,",01:14:27.162,01:14:28.620
you know what I'm talking about.,01:14:28.620,01:14:29.953
You know what I'm referring to.,01:14:29.953,01:14:31.320
And this is just jargon.,01:14:31.320,01:14:33.000
"But in the end, those
are just probabilities.",01:14:33.000,01:14:35.610
"I mean, these a
natural quantities.",01:14:35.610,01:14:38.369
"Just for some reason,
people have been used",01:14:38.369,01:14:40.160
to using different terminology.,01:14:40.160,01:14:43.850
So just to illustrate.,01:14:43.850,01:14:46.420
When do I make a typo 1 error?,01:14:46.420,01:14:48.090
"And when do I not
make a type 1 error?",01:14:48.090,01:14:51.880
"So I make a type 1 error if h0
is true and I reject h0, right?",01:14:51.880,01:14:56.500
"So the off diagonal blocks
are when I make an error.",01:14:56.500,01:14:59.560
"When I'm on the diagonal
terms, h1 is true",01:14:59.560,01:15:02.920
"and I reject h0, that's
a correct decision.",01:15:02.920,01:15:05.530
"When h0 is true and
I fail to reject h0,",01:15:05.530,01:15:08.200
"that's also the correct
decision to make.",01:15:08.200,01:15:11.210
"So I only make errors when
I'm in one of the red blocks.",01:15:11.210,01:15:17.110
"And one block is the type
1 error and the other block",01:15:17.110,01:15:20.860
is the type 2 error.,01:15:20.860,01:15:21.730
"That's all it means, OK?",01:15:21.730,01:15:24.059
"So you just have to know
which one we called one.",01:15:24.059,01:15:26.100
"I mean, this was chosen
in a pretty ad hoc way.",01:15:32.460,01:15:36.960
"So to conclude this lecture,
let me ask you a few questions.",01:15:36.960,01:15:40.440
"If in a US court, the
defendant is found either say,",01:15:40.440,01:15:46.780
"let's just say for the sake of
discussion, innocent or guilty.",01:15:46.780,01:15:49.601
All right?,01:15:49.601,01:15:50.100
"It's really guilty
for not guilty,",01:15:50.100,01:15:51.516
"but let's say
innocent or guilty.",01:15:51.516,01:15:53.900
"When does the jury
make a type 1 error?",01:15:53.900,01:15:56.106
Yep?,01:16:03.414,01:16:03.914
And he's guilty?,01:16:07.840,01:16:10.180
"And he's innocent, right?",01:16:10.180,01:16:11.560
"The status quo, everybody is
innocent until proven guilty.",01:16:11.560,01:16:14.560
"So that's our h0 is that
the person is innocent.",01:16:14.560,01:16:18.500
"And so, that means
that h0 is innocent.",01:16:18.500,01:16:21.510
"And so, we're looking at the
probably of type 1 error,",01:16:21.510,01:16:23.760
"so that's when we reject
the fact that it's innocent.",01:16:23.760,01:16:25.560
"So conclude that this
person is guilty, OK?",01:16:25.560,01:16:27.752
"So type 1 error is when
this person is innocent",01:16:27.752,01:16:29.710
and we conclude it's guilty.,01:16:29.710,01:16:31.090
What is the type 2 error?,01:16:31.090,01:16:32.131
"Letting a guilty
person go free, which",01:16:36.390,01:16:38.160
"actually according
to the constitution,",01:16:38.160,01:16:40.290
is the better of the two.,01:16:40.290,01:16:42.320
All right?,01:16:42.320,01:16:42.820
"So what we're going to try to
do is to control the first one,",01:16:42.820,01:16:45.361
"and hope for the best
for the second one.",01:16:45.361,01:16:47.870
"How could the jury make sure
that they make no type 1",01:16:47.870,01:16:51.260
error ever?,01:16:51.260,01:16:52.500
"Always let the guy
go free, right?",01:16:57.870,01:17:01.406
"What is the effect
on the type 2 error?",01:17:01.406,01:17:03.030
"Yeah, it's the worst
possible, right?",01:17:06.600,01:17:08.430
"I mean, basically, for every guy
that's guilty, you let them go.",01:17:08.430,01:17:12.550
That's the worst you can do.,01:17:12.550,01:17:14.970
"And same thing, right?",01:17:14.970,01:17:15.930
"How can the jury make sure
that there's no type 2 error?",01:17:15.930,01:17:20.470
Always convict.,01:17:20.470,01:17:21.140
"What is the effect on
the American budget?",01:17:21.140,01:17:22.890
"What is the effect
on the type 1 error?",01:17:22.890,01:17:25.135
Right.,01:17:28.180,01:17:28.680
"So the effect is that basically
the type 1 error is maximized.",01:17:28.680,01:17:31.710
"So there's this trade
off between type 1",01:17:31.710,01:17:33.540
"and type 2 error
that's inherent.",01:17:33.540,01:17:35.430
"And that's why we have this
sort of multi objective thing.",01:17:35.430,01:17:39.030
"We're trying to minimize
two things at the same time.",01:17:39.030,01:17:41.530
"And I can't find many
ad hoc ways, right?",01:17:41.530,01:17:44.340
"So if you've taken
any optimization,",01:17:44.340,01:17:46.730

things when one is going up",01:17:46.730,01:17:49.040
"while the other one is going
down, the only thing you can do",01:17:49.040,01:17:51.540
is make ad hoc heuristics.,01:17:51.540,01:17:53.370
"Maybe you try to minimize
the sum of those two guys.",01:17:53.370,01:17:55.740
"Maybe you try to minimize
1/3 of the first guy",01:17:55.740,01:17:59.310
plus 2/3 of the second guy.,01:17:59.310,01:18:00.940

the first guy plus the square",01:18:00.940,01:18:03.390
of the second guy.,01:18:03.390,01:18:04.140

ways, but none of them",01:18:04.140,01:18:05.973

hypothesis testing,",01:18:07.470,01:18:10.120
