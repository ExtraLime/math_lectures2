me what a proof is?",00:00:24.070,00:00:26.540
"Any ideas of, what
is a proof, anyway?",00:00:26.540,00:00:29.459
Any thoughts?,00:00:29.459,00:00:30.000
Yeah?,00:00:30.000,00:00:30.874

set of assumptions",00:00:36.215,00:00:39.161

PROFESSOR: Very good.,00:00:40.730,00:00:41.810
I like that.,00:00:41.810,00:00:42.640
"That's very close to what
we're going to do here, yeah.",00:00:42.640,00:00:47.090
"Now, that's a special
kind of proof, though.",00:00:47.090,00:00:50.110
That's a mathematical proof.,00:00:50.110,00:00:52.290
"And I'm going to write
a definition very",00:00:52.290,00:00:54.170
close to that in a few minutes.,00:00:54.170,00:00:56.610

of a higher level",00:01:00.830,00:01:03.960
notion of what a proof is?,00:01:03.960,00:01:05.061
"That's correct, what
you said, but there's",00:01:05.061,00:01:06.810
"a higher meta level notion of
what a proof is beyond that.",00:01:06.810,00:01:12.500

Any thoughts about a proof?,00:01:18.490,00:01:22.710
"OK, well, I think
generally, a proof",00:01:22.710,00:01:26.970
"is considered, across
multiple fields,",00:01:26.970,00:01:29.400
"as a method for
ascertaining the truth.",00:01:29.400,00:01:31.150
And you described one method.,00:01:36.720,00:01:38.190
"Now, by ascertaining, I mean
establishing truth, verifying",00:01:51.370,00:01:54.720
truth.,00:01:54.720,00:01:56.340

"in society, and
even within science.",00:01:58.930,00:02:02.540

"PROFESSOR:
Observation, experiment",00:02:15.560,00:02:17.260
and observation-- excellent.,00:02:17.260,00:02:18.640
"And that's the
bedrock of physics.",00:02:18.640,00:02:23.540
"I mean, who really knows if
there's gravity out there?",00:02:23.540,00:02:27.580
"Well, we observe it.",00:02:27.580,00:02:29.720
"And so we then conclude
that's the truth.",00:02:29.720,00:02:31.730
"There's gravity, and
we have laws about it.",00:02:31.730,00:02:33.607
That's one good way.,00:02:33.607,00:02:34.440
"What's another way
of ascertaining truth",00:02:34.440,00:02:39.890

or beyond science, just",00:02:39.890,00:02:43.830
in society?,00:02:43.830,00:02:45.150
How is truth established?,00:02:45.150,00:02:47.700
What are the ways?,00:02:47.700,00:02:48.450
Yeah?,00:02:48.450,00:02:48.950
"AUDIENCE: Well,
establishing what's false,",00:02:48.950,00:02:50.704
"you can know what
things aren't true.",00:02:50.704,00:02:53.620
"Then that helps you
narrow down what is true.",00:02:53.620,00:02:56.109
"PROFESSOR: Yes, truth--
yeah, that's great.",00:02:56.109,00:02:57.900
"Truth is the opposite
of falsehood.",00:02:57.900,00:02:59.980
How do we establish falsehood?,00:02:59.980,00:03:02.590

yeah, that's good.",00:03:10.100,00:03:13.460
"So in fact, even a step
more general, sampling.",00:03:13.460,00:03:16.890
Counterexamples are ways.,00:03:20.030,00:03:21.730
"If you do something, an
experiment, ten times,",00:03:26.320,00:03:28.400
"and every time, it comes out
one way, that's truth, maybe.",00:03:28.400,00:03:33.310
"But there's fields where
that becomes truth.",00:03:33.310,00:03:36.329
What about other ways?,00:03:36.329,00:03:37.245
"How are we going to
decide if Roger Clemens is",00:03:41.490,00:03:44.760

conclusion there?",00:04:01.350,00:04:03.512

PROFESSOR: The jury.,00:04:04.220,00:04:05.540

make decisions on truth.",00:04:40.850,00:04:43.840

truths, even, than judges",00:04:43.840,00:04:46.250

"There's one really big one
that causes a lot of issues.",00:04:51.530,00:04:54.680
Yeah?,00:04:54.680,00:04:55.180
AUDIENCE: Religion.,00:04:55.180,00:04:55.870
PROFESSOR: What is it?,00:04:55.870,00:04:56.420
AUDIENCE: Religion.,00:04:56.420,00:04:57.211
"PROFESSOR: Religion, the word
of God-- broadly construed here,",00:04:57.211,00:05:01.824
for religion.,00:05:01.824,00:05:02.365
"Now, that one is really
hard to argue about",00:05:05.440,00:05:08.140
because you believe it.,00:05:08.140,00:05:10.750
"And especially if you're
not talking to God regularly",00:05:10.750,00:05:13.440
"and somebody is, well, it's
hard to argue about the truth.",00:05:13.440,00:05:17.904
"So you rely on others
to interpret it for you,",00:05:17.904,00:05:19.820
"often-- a priest, or
a minister, a rabbi.",00:05:19.820,00:05:23.560
"And it gets complicated,
because you can end up",00:05:23.560,00:05:25.640
"with conflicting truths based on
who you think you're talking to",00:05:25.640,00:05:29.890
"or who the translator
is for you.",00:05:29.890,00:05:33.220
"Another one is the
word of your boss.",00:05:33.220,00:05:37.080
Whatever the boss says is right.,00:05:37.080,00:05:39.850
"Often in business, the
customer is always right.",00:05:39.850,00:05:42.650
"That's the truth, whatever
the customer says.",00:05:42.650,00:05:46.680
"With Donald Trump as your
boss, you'd better agree",00:05:46.680,00:05:48.920
or you're fired.,00:05:48.920,00:05:49.586
"Often in classes, the
professor says it, it is true.",00:05:53.560,00:05:57.110
Because the authority said it.,00:05:57.110,00:05:58.910
That's not true here.,00:05:58.910,00:06:00.290
That will not hold.,00:06:00.290,00:06:01.600
"And one of the nicest things
about math that I like a lot",00:06:01.600,00:06:05.340
"is that the youngest
student can stand up",00:06:05.340,00:06:09.230
"against the most oldest,
most experienced professor,",00:06:09.230,00:06:12.020
"and win an argument
on mathematics.",00:06:12.020,00:06:15.015
"I do get pleasure when a student
comes up and proves me wrong.",00:06:17.267,00:06:19.850
"I loved it when that
student came in,",00:06:19.850,00:06:21.391
"and she showed me
what I said really",00:06:21.391,00:06:23.240
"wasn't right when you
looked at it carefully",00:06:23.240,00:06:25.090
or in a different light.,00:06:25.090,00:06:27.400
"Now, sometimes if I do it on the
board here and it's in class,",00:06:27.400,00:06:30.230
"well, that's fun.",00:06:30.230,00:06:31.990
"I feel a little
embarrassed afterwards.",00:06:31.990,00:06:34.740
"But it's a good thing
about mathematics,",00:06:34.740,00:06:36.640
"is you can have that
kind of dialogue.",00:06:36.640,00:06:41.550
"OK, another one, which is
related to the word of God",00:06:41.550,00:06:45.200
"sometimes, is inner
conviction-- very popular",00:06:45.200,00:06:50.370
"in computer science, believe
it or not, with the mantra,",00:06:50.370,00:06:54.020
there are no bugs in my program.,00:06:54.020,00:06:57.820
"I can't tell you how
many times you hear that.",00:06:57.820,00:07:00.850
"Closely related is, I don't
see why not something is true.",00:07:00.850,00:07:06.790
"And that's a good
one, because that",00:07:06.790,00:07:08.940
"transfers the burden of proof to
anybody who disagrees with you.",00:07:08.940,00:07:13.906
You don't have to prove.,00:07:13.906,00:07:14.910
"You just say, I don't
see why it's not true.",00:07:14.910,00:07:16.550
"All of a sudden, the other
person who's questioning you,",00:07:16.550,00:07:18.883
"it becomes their job to disprove
you, which is not so good.",00:07:18.883,00:07:24.000
"OK, now in mathematics,
there's this higher level.",00:07:24.000,00:07:26.710
"And someone stated it
very clearly up there.",00:07:26.710,00:07:28.980
Let me write it up here.,00:07:28.980,00:07:31.460
"In mathematics, we have
a mathematical proof",00:07:31.460,00:07:39.280
"is a verification
of a proposition",00:07:39.280,00:07:57.700
"by a chain of logical
deductions from a set of axioms.",00:07:57.700,00:08:16.410
"Now, that's a bit of a mouthful.",00:08:22.030,00:08:24.070
"There's three important
components here--",00:08:24.070,00:08:28.500
"propositions, logical
deductions, and axioms.",00:08:28.500,00:08:34.780
"And we're going to spend
the rest of the class",00:08:34.780,00:08:37.130
"today talking about
each of these,",00:08:37.130,00:08:38.770
"and then give an
example of a proof.",00:08:38.770,00:08:41.144
We'll start with propositions.,00:08:41.144,00:08:42.394
"A proposition is a statement
that is either true or false.",00:08:46.910,00:09:04.000
"You may not know which one,
but it's one or the other.",00:09:07.130,00:09:10.800
"A simple example--
2 plus 3 equals 5.",00:09:10.800,00:09:15.310
"Now, that's a true proposition.",00:09:15.310,00:09:18.292
"Here's one that's a
little more interesting.",00:09:18.292,00:09:20.125
"For all n in the set
of natural numbers,",00:09:27.450,00:09:32.900
"n squared plus n plus
41 is a prime number.",00:09:32.900,00:09:38.660
"I know I've used
some notation here.",00:09:43.930,00:09:46.520
"This is-- the upside down
A is the for all symbol.",00:09:46.520,00:09:50.465
"How many people have not
seen that symbol before?",00:09:53.200,00:09:56.620
A bunch of you.,00:09:56.620,00:09:57.310
"You're going to see a bunch
of symbols here first week.",00:09:57.310,00:10:00.110
"And that means for every
possible choice of n--",00:10:00.110,00:10:03.520
"and this is in the natural
numbers, which is the set 0, 1,",00:10:03.520,00:10:08.010
"2, 3, and so forth.",00:10:08.010,00:10:11.970
It's the natural numbers.,00:10:11.970,00:10:13.644
"It's basically the
integers, but not negative.",00:10:13.644,00:10:15.560
"So we're saying for every
natural number, i.e. for 0,",00:10:19.570,00:10:22.790
"for 1, for 2, and for 3, and
so forth, this expression",00:10:22.790,00:10:26.700
is a prime.,00:10:26.700,00:10:27.540
"Now, a prime number
is a number that",00:10:27.540,00:10:30.410
"is not divisible by any other
number besides itself and 1.",00:10:30.410,00:10:35.830
"So 1, 3, 5, 7 are prime.",00:10:35.830,00:10:38.850
9 is not because it's 3 times 3.,00:10:38.850,00:10:41.890
"Now, this part here is
called the predicate.",00:10:41.890,00:10:45.700
"And a predicate is a
proposition whose truth",00:10:49.390,00:11:00.420
"depends on the value of a
variable-- in this case, n.",00:11:00.420,00:11:11.090
"All right, this is referred to
as the universe of discourse.",00:11:16.780,00:11:21.480
"It's the space of all the
things we're talking about.",00:11:21.480,00:11:24.240
"We're only talking about
natural numbers here.",00:11:24.240,00:11:28.230
This is called a quantifier.,00:11:28.230,00:11:30.140
"We'll see more
quantifiers later.",00:11:30.140,00:11:31.900
"All right, now to see if
this proposition is true,",00:11:34.620,00:11:39.820
"we need to make sure
that this predicate is",00:11:39.820,00:11:43.120
true for every natural number n.,00:11:43.120,00:11:46.770
"So let's see if
we can check that.",00:11:46.770,00:11:51.160
Let's try some values.,00:11:51.160,00:11:53.140
"So we'll try n is 1,
2, 3, and so forth.",00:11:53.140,00:11:58.230
"And we'll compute n
squared plus n plus 41.",00:11:58.230,00:12:02.390
"And then we'll
check, is it prime?",00:12:02.390,00:12:05.890
"So for n equals 0, n squared
plus n plus 41 is 41.",00:12:05.890,00:12:12.202
Is 41 prime?,00:12:12.202,00:12:13.405
"Yeah, nothing divides
41 but itself and 1.",00:12:16.390,00:12:19.450
"All right, let's try 1.",00:12:21.980,00:12:23.120
1 squared plus 1 plus 41 is 43.,00:12:23.120,00:12:25.845
Is 43 prime?,00:12:25.845,00:12:28.120
Yes.,00:12:28.120,00:12:30.400
Let's try 2.,00:12:30.400,00:12:32.050
"We get 4 plus 2 is
6 plus 41 is 47.",00:12:32.050,00:12:36.440
Is 47 prime?,00:12:36.440,00:12:38.230
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:12:38.230,00:12:39.030
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:12:39.030,00:12:40.650
Looking good.,00:12:40.650,00:12:41.200
"3-- I got 9, 12, 53.",00:12:41.200,00:12:46.640
Is 53 prime?,00:12:46.640,00:12:48.600
Yeah.,00:12:48.600,00:12:50.000
And I could keep on going here.,00:12:50.000,00:12:51.810
I could go down to 20.,00:12:51.810,00:12:53.550
I get 420-- 461.,00:12:53.550,00:12:57.140
"In fact, that is a prime.",00:12:57.140,00:13:00.150
"And I could just
keep on going here.",00:13:00.150,00:13:02.410
Go down to 39.,00:13:02.410,00:13:03.460
"I get 1,601.",00:13:03.460,00:13:06.967
You can check.,00:13:06.967,00:13:07.550
That is a prime.,00:13:07.550,00:13:09.880
"The first 40 values of n,
the proposition is true.",00:13:09.880,00:13:13.120
The predicate is true.,00:13:13.120,00:13:14.700
It is prime.,00:13:14.700,00:13:16.640
"Now, this is a great example
because in a lot of fields--",00:13:16.640,00:13:20.520
"physics, for example;
statistics, often-- you",00:13:20.520,00:13:25.560
checked 40 examples.,00:13:25.560,00:13:26.720
"That's above and beyond
the call of duty.",00:13:26.720,00:13:29.040
It's always true.,00:13:29.040,00:13:30.820
"So yeah, this must
be true, right?",00:13:30.820,00:13:35.160
"No, wrong.",00:13:35.160,00:13:37.730
"Often, you'll see this in
a lot of scientific fields.",00:13:37.730,00:13:40.940
It is not true.,00:13:40.940,00:13:41.690
"Can anybody give
me an example of n",00:13:41.690,00:13:43.220
"for which n squared plus
n plus 41 is not prime?",00:13:43.220,00:13:46.750
Yeah?,00:13:46.750,00:13:47.390
AUDIENCE: 40.,00:13:47.390,00:13:48.270
"PROFESSOR: 40, good.",00:13:48.270,00:13:49.720
Let's see about 40.,00:13:49.720,00:13:51.720
"40 squared plus 40
plus 41 is 1,681.",00:13:51.720,00:13:59.990
What's that equal?,00:13:59.990,00:14:02.960
41 squared.,00:14:02.960,00:14:06.070
So it is not prime.,00:14:06.070,00:14:07.740
"Somebody give me an obvious
example where it's not prime.",00:14:07.740,00:14:10.830
AUDIENCE: 41.,00:14:10.830,00:14:11.530
"PROFESSOR: 41--
yeah, 41 squared,",00:14:11.530,00:14:13.330
"we get everything
is divided by 41.",00:14:13.330,00:14:15.480
But 40 is the first break-point.,00:14:15.480,00:14:17.990
"So the first 40 examples
work, and then it failed.",00:14:17.990,00:14:22.110
"So this proposition is
false, even though it",00:14:22.110,00:14:26.570
was looking pretty good.,00:14:26.570,00:14:28.657
There's a reason I'm doing this.,00:14:28.657,00:14:29.990
"In fact, I'm going to
do it some more here.",00:14:29.990,00:14:31.990
"I'm going to beat you
over the head with it.",00:14:31.990,00:14:35.000
"Here's a famous in
mathematics statement.",00:14:35.000,00:14:39.353
"a to the fourth plus b to the
fourth plus c to the fourth",00:14:41.880,00:14:47.380
"equals d to the fourth has no
positive integer solutions.",00:14:47.380,00:15:01.200
That is a proposition.,00:15:01.200,00:15:02.980
"Now, this proposition was
conjectured to be true by Euler",00:15:02.980,00:15:07.160
in 1769.,00:15:07.160,00:15:09.740
Euler's a big honcho in math.,00:15:09.740,00:15:11.570
"We still talk about him
a lot even though he's",00:15:11.570,00:15:13.970
been dead for centuries.,00:15:13.970,00:15:16.700
"It was unsolved for
over 2 centuries.",00:15:16.700,00:15:20.100
Mathematicians worked on it.,00:15:20.100,00:15:21.890
"It was finally disapproved
by a very clever fellow",00:15:21.890,00:15:25.280
"named Noam Elkies 218 years
later after it was conjectured.",00:15:25.280,00:15:30.090
"He worked at that other
school down the street.",00:15:30.090,00:15:34.100
And he came up with this.,00:15:34.100,00:15:37.200
"a equals 95,800.",00:15:37.200,00:15:41.990
"b equals 217,519.",00:15:41.990,00:15:46.510
"c equals 414,560.",00:15:46.510,00:15:49.912
"You don't have to
remember these numbers.",00:15:49.912,00:15:51.620
"We're not going to quiz
you on that-- 422,481.",00:15:51.620,00:15:57.217
"Now, he claims-- I've never
personally checked it,",00:15:57.217,00:15:59.300
"but presumably, people have--
you plug those in here,",00:15:59.300,00:16:02.360
and you have an equality.,00:16:02.360,00:16:04.580
So he says.,00:16:04.580,00:16:05.850
"So in fact, the
correct proposition",00:16:05.850,00:16:08.340
"is there does exist a, b,
c, d in the positive natural",00:16:08.340,00:16:15.980
"numbers such that a the fourth

"c to the fourth equals
d to the fourth.",00:16:20.000,00:16:23.510

here called there exists.",00:16:23.510,00:16:28.460
"Instead of an
upside down A, it's",00:16:28.460,00:16:29.870
a backwards E. Don't ask me why.,00:16:29.870,00:16:33.030
That's what it is.,00:16:33.030,00:16:35.960
"The plus means you can't
have 0 or negative numbers.",00:16:35.960,00:16:40.040
"So these are the
positive natural numbers.",00:16:40.040,00:16:42.280
"And here's your predicate, which
of course, the truth of this",00:16:45.750,00:16:51.080
"depends on the values
of a, b, c and d.",00:16:51.080,00:16:54.951
"It took a long time to figure
out that actually, there",00:16:54.951,00:16:57.200
was a solution here.,00:16:57.200,00:16:58.817
"Obviously, everything they
tried until that time failed.",00:16:58.817,00:17:01.150
Let me give you another one.,00:17:01.150,00:17:02.316
"313 x cubed plus y cubed equals
z cubed has no positive integer",00:17:08.300,00:17:24.085
solutions.,00:17:24.085,00:17:24.585
This turns out to be false.,00:17:29.530,00:17:31.850
"But the shortest,
smallest counter-example",00:17:31.850,00:17:34.580
"has over 1,000 digits.",00:17:34.580,00:17:37.950
This one was easy.,00:17:37.950,00:17:38.770
It only has six digits.,00:17:38.770,00:17:40.650
"So there's no way ever
you'd use a computer",00:17:40.650,00:17:43.560
"to exhaustively search
1,000 digit numbers here",00:17:43.560,00:17:46.600
to show it's false.,00:17:46.600,00:17:49.440
"Now, of course, some of you are
probably thinking, why on earth",00:17:49.440,00:17:53.810
"would I care if 313 times
x cubed plus y cubed equals",00:17:53.810,00:17:58.860
z cubed has a solution?,00:17:58.860,00:18:02.484

won't be the last time",00:18:02.484,00:18:04.150
"that thought occurs to
you during the term.",00:18:04.150,00:18:07.310
"And why on earth
would anybody ever try",00:18:07.310,00:18:09.635
to even find a solution to that?,00:18:09.635,00:18:13.320
"I mean, mathematicians
are sort of a rare breed.",00:18:13.320,00:18:15.830
"Now, actually in
this case, that's",00:18:15.830,00:18:18.417
really important in practice.,00:18:18.417,00:18:19.625
"This equation is an
example of what's",00:18:22.580,00:18:24.280
"called an elliptic
curve-- elliptic curve.",00:18:24.280,00:18:26.300
"You study these if you're really
a specialist in mathematics",00:18:26.300,00:18:29.820

"for certain
three-letter agencies",00:18:32.030,00:18:34.770
"because it's central to
the understanding of how",00:18:34.770,00:18:37.140
to factor large integers.,00:18:37.140,00:18:39.670
"That means factoring,
showing that-- what was it--",00:18:39.670,00:18:43.760
"1,681 is 41 times 41.",00:18:43.760,00:18:46.916
"And I said, OK, who
cares about factoring?",00:18:46.916,00:18:50.380
"Well, factoring is the
way to break cryptosystems",00:18:50.380,00:18:54.880
"like RSA, which are
used for everything",00:18:54.880,00:18:58.625
that we do electronically today.,00:18:58.625,00:19:01.840
You have a Paypal account.,00:19:01.840,00:19:03.130
You buy something online.,00:19:03.130,00:19:04.230
You're using SSL.,00:19:04.230,00:19:05.710
"They're all using cryptosystems,
almost all of which",00:19:05.710,00:19:08.750
are based on number theory.,00:19:08.750,00:19:10.400
"And in particular, they're
based on factoring.",00:19:10.400,00:19:13.130
"And if you can find good
solutions to things like this,",00:19:13.130,00:19:16.570
"or solutions to things
like this, all of a sudden,",00:19:16.570,00:19:19.260
"you can get an angle and
a wedge on factoring.",00:19:19.260,00:19:23.325
"And it's because
of that that now",00:19:23.325,00:19:24.700
"RSA uses 1,000 digit
moduluses instead of hundred",00:19:24.700,00:19:30.940
"digit moduluses like
they used to use,",00:19:30.940,00:19:32.844
"because people figured
out how to factor",00:19:32.844,00:19:34.510
"and how to break
the cryptosystem.",00:19:34.510,00:19:36.430
"If you could break
those cryptosystems,",00:19:36.430,00:19:39.490
"well, you can't rule the
world, but it's close.",00:19:39.490,00:19:42.350
"All right, so we'll
talk more about this",00:19:42.350,00:19:44.950
"the week after next when
we do number theory,",00:19:44.950,00:19:46.830
"and we work up to RSA and
how that cryptosystem works,",00:19:46.830,00:19:50.020
"and why factoring
is so important.",00:19:50.020,00:19:52.880
"So yeah, you don't
have to really have",00:19:52.880,00:19:55.537
to worry about this.,00:19:55.537,00:19:56.370
But these things are important.,00:19:56.370,00:19:57.661
"And the bigger message is that
you don't just try a few cases,",00:19:57.661,00:20:01.750
"and if it works,
you think it's done.",00:20:01.750,00:20:04.610
"That's not how the game
works in mathematics.",00:20:04.610,00:20:06.906
"You can get an
idea of maybe it's",00:20:06.906,00:20:08.280
"true, but doesn't
tell you the answer.",00:20:08.280,00:20:13.390
"All right, let me
give you another one.",00:20:13.390,00:20:15.380
"This is another very famous
one that probably most of you",00:20:15.380,00:20:17.785
have heard of.,00:20:17.785,00:20:19.830
"The regions in any map can
be colored in four colors",00:20:19.830,00:20:34.880
"so that adjacent regions
have different colors.",00:20:34.880,00:20:47.710
"Like a map of the
United States--",00:20:47.710,00:20:49.270
every state gets a color.,00:20:49.270,00:20:50.860
"If two states share
a border, they",00:20:50.860,00:20:53.020
"have different colors so
you can distinguish them.",00:20:53.020,00:20:57.430
"This is known as the
four color theorem.",00:20:57.430,00:20:59.530
"And it's very famous in
the popular literature.",00:20:59.530,00:21:02.570
"How many people have heard
of this theorem before?",00:21:02.570,00:21:05.060
"Yeah, OK.",00:21:05.060,00:21:05.680
So you've all heard of it.,00:21:05.680,00:21:07.334
It has a long history.,00:21:07.334,00:21:08.250
"It was conjectured by somebody
named Guthrie in 1853.",00:21:08.250,00:21:12.240
"He's the first person to say
this ought to be possible.",00:21:12.240,00:21:14.950
"And there were many false
proofs over the ensuing century.",00:21:14.950,00:21:20.630
"One of the most convincing
was a proof using pictures",00:21:20.630,00:21:23.510
"by Kempe in 1879,
26 years later.",00:21:23.510,00:21:28.700
"And this proof was
believed for over a decade.",00:21:28.700,00:21:31.420
"Mathematicians thought
the proof was right",00:21:31.420,00:21:33.890
"until another mathematician
named Heawood found",00:21:33.890,00:21:36.570
a fatal flaw in the argument.,00:21:36.570,00:21:39.270
"Now, this proof
by Kempe consisted",00:21:39.270,00:21:41.510
"of drawing pictures of what
maps have to look like.",00:21:41.510,00:21:45.204
"So he started by
saying, a map has",00:21:45.204,00:21:46.620
to look like one of these types.,00:21:46.620,00:21:47.953
"And he would draw
pictures of them.",00:21:47.953,00:21:49.620
"And then he argued that those
types that he drew pictures of,",00:21:49.620,00:21:52.690
it worked for.,00:21:52.690,00:21:55.580
"Proofs by picture are often
very convincing and very wrong.",00:21:55.580,00:22:01.110
"And I'm going to give you one
to start lecture next time.",00:22:01.110,00:22:03.550
"It'll be a proof by PowerPoint,
which is even worse than proof",00:22:03.550,00:22:06.133
by picture.,00:22:06.133,00:22:08.130
And it is compelling.,00:22:08.130,00:22:10.971
"And the point will to be to
show you proofs by picture",00:22:10.971,00:22:13.220
are generally not a good thing.,00:22:13.220,00:22:15.387
"Because your brain
just locks in-- oh,",00:22:15.387,00:22:16.970
that's what it has to look like.,00:22:16.970,00:22:19.010
"And you don't think about other
ways that it might look like.",00:22:19.010,00:22:22.510
"Now, the four color
theorem was finally",00:22:22.510,00:22:24.240
"proved by Appel
and Haken in 1977,",00:22:24.240,00:22:29.120
"but they had to use a computer
to check thousands of cases.",00:22:29.120,00:22:34.970
"Now, this was a little
disturbing to mathematicians,",00:22:34.970,00:22:37.510
"because how do they know the
computer did the right thing?",00:22:37.510,00:22:42.989
"Your colleague writes
a proof on the board.",00:22:42.989,00:22:44.780
You can check it.,00:22:44.780,00:22:45.630
"But how do you know the
computer didn't mess up,",00:22:45.630,00:22:47.630
or not do some cases?,00:22:47.630,00:22:50.130
"Now, everybody
believes it's true now.",00:22:50.130,00:22:52.620
But it's unsatisfying.,00:22:52.620,00:22:54.780
"A few years ago, a 12-page
human proof was discovered,",00:22:54.780,00:23:00.420
but it's not been verified.,00:23:00.420,00:23:01.810
"And people are very
suspicious of it",00:23:01.810,00:23:04.180
"because the proof of
the main lemma says,",00:23:04.180,00:23:06.800
"quote, ""details of this
lemma is left to the reader.",00:23:06.800,00:23:10.740

"That's what the main
lemma of the proof is.",00:23:12.509,00:23:14.300
"But people think
that maybe there",00:23:14.300,00:23:15.674

"after an 1859 paper

"The hypothesis has been proved
to 1.5 billion zeros, not far",00:26:06.690,00:26:11.350
enough to prove it completely.,00:26:11.350,00:26:13.860
"If they did 1.5
trillion zeros, it",00:26:13.860,00:26:15.660
"wouldn't be far enough to
prove it completely, of course.",00:26:15.660,00:26:19.230

the Riemann hypothesis,",00:26:19.230,00:26:24.510

controversy around this guy.",00:26:59.490,00:27:02.880
"He had an 80-page proof, but
didn't have all the details.",00:27:02.880,00:27:06.290
"So then other teams
of mathematicians",00:27:06.290,00:27:07.880
"got together and wrote
350 pages of details.",00:27:07.880,00:27:12.770
"And then most people
believe now that it's right,",00:27:12.770,00:27:15.080

proof might not",00:27:15.080,00:27:16.940
"have had all the details, but
he had the right structure",00:27:16.940,00:27:19.420
of the proof.,00:27:19.420,00:27:20.540

"He won the highest prize in
mathematics, the Fields Medal.",00:27:23.040,00:27:26.090

"He rejected the Fields Medal and

"to explain it all
for us on video,",00:27:54.970,00:27:56.929

a simpler one here.",00:28:06.360,00:28:09.550
"For all n in Z, n greater
than or equal to 2",00:28:13.510,00:28:19.620
"implies n squared is
greater than or equal to 4.",00:28:19.620,00:28:24.240
"Now, Z, we use for the integers.",00:28:24.240,00:28:26.060
"And so that would be 0, 1, minus
1, 2, minus 2, and so forth.",00:28:30.230,00:28:37.440
And this symbol here is implies.,00:28:37.440,00:28:40.645
"I In fact, one
thing you can notice",00:28:45.310,00:28:47.100
"when you read the text is we
use different notation there",00:28:47.100,00:28:51.670
"as the standard than
I will use in lecture.",00:28:51.670,00:28:53.960
"And there's lots of
ways of doing it.",00:28:53.960,00:28:56.060
"You could have a double
arrow, a single arrow.",00:28:56.060,00:28:58.300
"You could write out
implies every time",00:28:58.300,00:29:00.000
as it's done in the text.,00:29:00.000,00:29:01.200
"And it doesn't really
matter which one",00:29:01.200,00:29:02.783
"you want to use as
long as you use one",00:29:02.783,00:29:04.700
of the conventions for implies.,00:29:04.700,00:29:07.630
"And let me define
what implies means.",00:29:07.630,00:29:10.515
"An implication p implies q is
said to be true if p is false",00:29:26.910,00:29:43.830
"or q is true, either one.",00:29:43.830,00:29:48.440
"So we can write this down
in terms of a truth table",00:29:48.440,00:29:55.480
as follows.,00:29:55.480,00:29:56.800
You have the values of p and q.,00:29:56.800,00:29:59.680
"And I'll give the
value of p implies q.",00:29:59.680,00:30:03.048
"If p is true and q is true,
what about p implies q?",00:30:03.048,00:30:11.575
"It's true, because q is
true in the definition.",00:30:11.575,00:30:16.330
If p is true and q is false?,00:30:16.330,00:30:19.594
AUDIENCE: False.,00:30:19.594,00:30:20.260
PROFESSOR: False.,00:30:20.260,00:30:22.910
P is false.,00:30:22.910,00:30:23.880
Q is true.,00:30:23.880,00:30:24.610
True.,00:30:27.292,00:30:28.190
What about false and false?,00:30:28.190,00:30:32.440
It's true.,00:30:32.440,00:30:34.230
"Even though this is false,
as long as p is false,",00:30:34.230,00:30:36.760
p implies q is true.,00:30:36.760,00:30:40.790
"So this is important
to remember.",00:30:40.790,00:30:43.520
"False implies anything is true,
which is a little strange.",00:30:43.520,00:30:49.800
There's a famous expression.,00:30:49.800,00:30:51.880
"If pigs could fly,
I would be king.",00:30:51.880,00:30:55.819
Is that true?,00:30:55.819,00:30:56.360
Sort of.,00:30:59.920,00:31:01.020
"In fact, this
statement, pigs fly",00:31:01.020,00:31:07.740
"implies I'm king-- that's
true, because pigs don't fly.",00:31:07.740,00:31:18.400
"Doesn't matter whether or
not I'm king, which I'm not.",00:31:18.400,00:31:21.420
"Since pigs don't fly,
even though that's false,",00:31:21.420,00:31:24.010
the implication is true.,00:31:24.010,00:31:27.414
"Now, some of you have worked
on these things before.",00:31:27.414,00:31:29.580
It's second nature.,00:31:29.580,00:31:30.470
"If you haven't,
you want to start",00:31:30.470,00:31:32.190
getting familiar with that.,00:31:32.190,00:31:34.100
Let's do another example.,00:31:36.504,00:31:37.545
What about this proposition?,00:31:49.610,00:31:50.776
"For all integers, n in Z, n
greater than or equal to 2--",00:31:53.850,00:32:00.610
"this is if and only if--
n squared greater than",00:32:00.610,00:32:05.350
or equal to 4.,00:32:05.350,00:32:07.890
Is that true?,00:32:07.890,00:32:08.590
"Is n only bigger
than 2 if and only",00:32:12.830,00:32:15.600
if n squared is bigger than 4?,00:32:15.600,00:32:18.030
It's false.,00:32:18.030,00:32:19.100
"What's an example of n
for which that's false?",00:32:19.100,00:32:22.490
"Negative, all right?",00:32:22.490,00:32:23.620
So it's false.,00:32:23.620,00:32:25.980
"n equals negative 3, all right?",00:32:25.980,00:32:30.560
"Negative 3 squared is
bigger than or equal to 4,",00:32:30.560,00:32:32.620
"but negative 3 is not
bigger than or equal to 2.",00:32:32.620,00:32:34.620
"And in fact this if
and only if means you",00:32:34.620,00:32:39.670
"have to have an
implication both ways.",00:32:39.670,00:32:43.660
"So you have to check
both ways for it.",00:32:43.660,00:32:45.625
"So let's do the truth table--
extend this truth table out",00:32:45.625,00:32:48.000
"here to do the truth table
for p if and only if q.",00:32:48.000,00:32:55.340
So here are p and q.,00:33:04.740,00:33:05.790
"Is q implies p
true for this row?",00:33:08.590,00:33:12.800
Does true imply true?,00:33:12.800,00:33:16.760
Yeah.,00:33:16.760,00:33:18.000
False implies true?,00:33:18.000,00:33:20.891
That's true.,00:33:20.891,00:33:22.120
True does not apply false.,00:33:22.120,00:33:23.570
That's false.,00:33:23.570,00:33:25.160
And false implies false.,00:33:25.160,00:33:27.660
"And so now, we can see
where p is if and only if q.",00:33:27.660,00:33:33.500
"If they're both true,
then it's true here.",00:33:33.500,00:33:37.860
What about here?,00:33:37.860,00:33:38.660
"Is p true if and only if
q is true in this case?",00:33:38.660,00:33:41.670
"No, because p implies q is
false, but q implies p is true.",00:33:44.360,00:33:49.190
So it's false.,00:33:49.190,00:33:50.980
False here.,00:33:50.980,00:33:51.730
"I made a mistake there, right?",00:33:54.570,00:33:56.490
That was true-- oops.,00:33:56.490,00:34:00.070
"And true if and
only if true, OK.",00:34:00.070,00:34:01.900
"They're both true, so we're OK.",00:34:01.900,00:34:05.240
"So p if and only if q is
true when they're both true",00:34:05.240,00:34:08.260
or both false.,00:34:08.260,00:34:09.499
And that's it.,00:34:09.499,00:34:10.744
"If they're different,
then it's not true.",00:34:10.744,00:34:13.889
"The key here is to
always check both ways.",00:34:13.889,00:34:17.860
"So if you're asked to
prove an if and only if,",00:34:17.860,00:34:20.139
"you have to prove that
way, and that way.",00:34:20.139,00:34:23.037
"We've just done about

"Well, it's true it's

that's true in some world.",00:35:06.940,00:35:11.470
"Because yeah, that's a tissue.",00:35:11.470,00:35:13.214
So it's a true statement.,00:35:13.214,00:35:14.255
AUDIENCE: Hello.,00:35:16.790,00:35:17.670
PROFESSOR: Hello.,00:35:17.670,00:35:18.641
That's good.,00:35:18.641,00:35:19.140
"That's neither true
or false, yeah.",00:35:19.140,00:35:21.590
A question.,00:35:21.590,00:35:22.720
"Who are you-- neither
true nor false.",00:35:22.720,00:35:25.080
"So not everything
is a proposition.",00:35:25.080,00:35:27.000
"But in this course,
pretty much everything",00:35:27.000,00:35:28.750
"we deal with will
be a proposition.",00:35:28.750,00:35:31.620
"All right, so that's
it for propositions.",00:35:31.620,00:35:34.166
Any questions on propositions?,00:35:34.166,00:35:35.415
"Next, we're going to
talk about axioms.",00:35:38.460,00:35:41.315
"Now, the good news is that
axioms are the same thing,",00:35:47.540,00:35:50.660
"really, as propositions.",00:35:50.660,00:35:52.920
"The only difference is that
axioms are propositions",00:35:52.920,00:35:56.130
that we just assume are true.,00:35:56.130,00:35:57.470
"An axiom is a proposition
that is assumed to be true.",00:36:01.930,00:36:16.470
"There's no proof that
an axiom is true.",00:36:20.130,00:36:23.570
"You just assume it because
you think it's reasonable.",00:36:23.570,00:36:26.740
"In fact, the word
""axiom"" comes from Greek.",00:36:26.740,00:36:29.430
It doesn't mean to be true.,00:36:29.430,00:36:32.250
"It means to think
worthy-- something",00:36:32.250,00:36:35.180
"you think is worthy enough
to be assumed to be true.",00:36:35.180,00:36:37.950
"Now, a lot of times, you'll hear
people say-- sometimes, we'll",00:36:37.950,00:36:40.780
"even say it to you--
don't make assumptions",00:36:40.780,00:36:44.000
when you're doing math.,00:36:44.000,00:36:46.150
"No, that's not true.",00:36:46.150,00:36:47.774
"You have to make assumptions
when you do math.",00:36:47.774,00:36:49.690
"Otherwise, you can't
do anything because you",00:36:49.690,00:36:51.570
have to start with some axioms.,00:36:51.570,00:36:53.900
"The key in math is to identify
what your assumptions are",00:36:53.900,00:36:58.240
so people can see them.,00:36:58.240,00:37:00.450
"And the idea is that
when you do a proof,",00:37:00.450,00:37:03.350
"anybody who agrees with your
assumptions or your axioms",00:37:03.350,00:37:06.634
can follow your proof.,00:37:06.634,00:37:07.550
"And they have to agree
with your conclusion.",00:37:07.550,00:37:09.660
"Now, they might disagree
with your axioms,",00:37:09.660,00:37:12.210
"in which case, they're not
going to buy your proof.",00:37:12.210,00:37:15.810
"Now, there are lots of
axioms used in math.",00:37:15.810,00:37:19.020
"For example, if a equals b and
b equals c, then a equals c.",00:37:19.020,00:37:31.670
There is no proof of that.,00:37:31.670,00:37:34.250
But it seems pretty good.,00:37:34.250,00:37:36.090
"And so we just throw it in the
bucket of axioms and use it.",00:37:36.090,00:37:41.580
"Now, axioms can be contradictory
in different contexts.",00:37:41.580,00:37:47.210
Here's a good example.,00:37:47.210,00:37:49.340
"In Euclidean geometry,
there's a central axiom that",00:37:49.340,00:37:56.220
"says given a line L
and a point p not on L,",00:37:56.220,00:38:11.420
"there is exactly one
line through p parallel",00:38:11.420,00:38:22.090
"to L. You all saw this in
geometry in middle school,",00:38:22.090,00:38:31.280
right?,00:38:31.280,00:38:32.020
You've got a point in a line.,00:38:32.020,00:38:33.228
"There's exactly another
line through the point",00:38:33.228,00:38:35.160
that's parallel to the line.,00:38:35.160,00:38:38.220
"Now, there's also a field
called spherical geometry.",00:38:38.220,00:38:40.600
"And there, you have an
axiom that contradicts this.",00:38:44.870,00:38:47.820
"It says, given a line L
and a point p not on L,",00:38:47.820,00:38:52.220
"there is no line through p
parallel to L on the sphere.",00:38:52.220,00:39:01.840
"There's a field called
hyperbolic geometry.",00:39:01.840,00:39:09.270
"And there, there's
an axiom that says,",00:39:09.270,00:39:11.190
"given a line L and
a point p not on L,",00:39:11.190,00:39:13.800
"there are infinitely many
lines through p parallel to L.",00:39:13.800,00:39:26.632
So how can this be?,00:39:26.632,00:39:27.690
"Does that mean one of these
fields is totally bogus,",00:39:27.690,00:39:29.870
or two of them are?,00:39:29.870,00:39:31.620
"Because they've got
contradictory axes.",00:39:31.620,00:39:34.470
That's OK.,00:39:34.470,00:39:35.860
"Just whatever field you're
in, state you're axioms.",00:39:35.860,00:39:39.230
"And they do make sense
in their various fields.",00:39:39.230,00:39:42.610
This is planar geometry.,00:39:42.610,00:39:43.794
This is on the sphere.,00:39:43.794,00:39:44.710
"And this is on
hyperbolic geometry.",00:39:44.710,00:39:47.880
"They make sense
in those contexts.",00:39:47.880,00:39:49.990
"So you can have more or less
whatever axioms you want.",00:39:49.990,00:39:54.750
"There are sort of two
guiding principles to axioms.",00:39:54.750,00:39:57.070
"Axioms should be-- it's called
consistent-- and complete.",00:40:15.440,00:40:22.305
"Now, a set of
axioms is consistent",00:40:25.890,00:40:39.880
"if no proposition can be proved
to be both true and false.",00:40:39.880,00:40:48.300
"And you can see why
that's important.",00:40:55.190,00:40:57.640
"If you spend three weeks
proving something's true,",00:40:57.640,00:41:02.120
"and the next day, somebody
proves it's also false,",00:41:02.120,00:41:04.880
"I mean, the whole
thing was pointless.",00:41:04.880,00:41:07.020
"So it only makes sense if
your axioms, as a group,",00:41:07.020,00:41:09.630
are consistent.,00:41:09.630,00:41:12.140
"A set of axioms is
said to be complete",00:41:12.140,00:41:26.610
"if it can be used to
prove every proposition is",00:41:26.610,00:41:35.800
either true or false.,00:41:35.800,00:41:37.060
"Now, this is desirable
because it means-- well,",00:41:48.560,00:41:51.930
you can solve every problem.,00:41:51.930,00:41:54.450
"Everything is-- you
can prove it's true,",00:41:54.450,00:41:56.314
or you can prove it's false.,00:41:56.314,00:41:57.480
You can get to the end.,00:41:57.480,00:42:00.010
"Now, you'd think
it shouldn't be too",00:42:00.010,00:42:05.280
"hard to get a set of axioms
that satisfies these two",00:42:05.280,00:42:08.230
basic properties.,00:42:08.230,00:42:09.730
"You're allowed to choose
whatever you want, really.",00:42:09.730,00:42:12.490
"Just, you don't want to be
creating contradictions.",00:42:12.490,00:42:14.990
"And you want a set
that's powerful enough",00:42:14.990,00:42:16.762
"that allows you to prove
everything is true or false,",00:42:16.762,00:42:18.970
one of the two.,00:42:18.970,00:42:20.740
"Turned out not to be
so easy to do this.",00:42:20.740,00:42:23.350
"And in fact, many logicians
spent their careers--",00:42:23.350,00:42:27.800
"famous logicians--
trying to find",00:42:27.800,00:42:29.700
"a set of axioms,
just one set, that",00:42:29.700,00:42:32.130
was consistent and complete.,00:42:32.130,00:42:34.529
"In fact, Russell and
Whitehead are probably",00:42:34.529,00:42:36.320
the two most famous.,00:42:36.320,00:42:37.820
"They spent their entire
careers doing this,",00:42:37.820,00:42:40.080
and they never got there.,00:42:40.080,00:42:42.270
"Then one day, this guy
named Kurt Godel showed up.",00:42:42.270,00:42:45.570
"And in the 1930s, he
proved it's not possible",00:42:45.570,00:42:49.940
"that there exists any
set of axioms that are",00:42:49.940,00:42:52.060
both consistent and complete.,00:42:52.060,00:42:56.450
"Now, this discovery
devastated the field.",00:42:56.450,00:42:59.560
It was a huge discovery.,00:42:59.560,00:43:02.270
"Imagine poor Russell
and Whitehead.",00:43:02.270,00:43:04.670
"They spent their entire careers
going after this holy grail.",00:43:04.670,00:43:08.035
"Then Kurt shows up
and said, hey, guys.",00:43:08.035,00:43:09.660
There's no grail.,00:43:09.660,00:43:10.580
It doesn't exist.,00:43:10.580,00:43:11.910
"And that's a little
depressing-- pretty bad day",00:43:11.910,00:43:14.580
when that happened.,00:43:14.580,00:43:15.840
"Now, it's an amazing
result, because it",00:43:15.840,00:43:18.000
"says if you want consistency--
and that's a must--",00:43:18.000,00:43:21.600
"there will be true facts
that you will never",00:43:21.600,00:43:24.630
be able to prove.,00:43:24.630,00:43:26.052
"We're not going to
prove that here.",00:43:26.052,00:43:27.510
It's proved in a logic course.,00:43:27.510,00:43:29.210
"For example, maybe
Goldbach's conjecture is true",00:43:29.210,00:43:32.740
and it is impossible to prove.,00:43:32.740,00:43:35.960
"Now, we're going to
try not to assign any",00:43:35.960,00:43:37.810
of those problems for homework.,00:43:37.810,00:43:40.210
"And in fact, they do exist.",00:43:40.210,00:43:42.182
It's complicated.,00:43:42.182,00:43:42.890
"You can state a problem that you
can't prove is true or false.",00:43:42.890,00:43:47.432
"And you may be thinking
that from time to time.",00:43:47.432,00:43:49.390
"Hey, it's one of those.",00:43:49.390,00:43:50.348
"Remember when your parents told
you if you work hard enough,",00:43:53.500,00:43:57.140
you can do anything?,00:43:57.140,00:43:59.270
They were wrong.,00:43:59.270,00:44:01.890
"All right, that's
enough for now.",00:44:01.890,00:44:03.270
"And we'll do more
of this next time.",00:44:03.270,00:44:06.020
