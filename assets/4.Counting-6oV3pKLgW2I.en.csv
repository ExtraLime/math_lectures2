PROFESSOR: OK.,00:00:21.996,00:00:22.490
"So today's lecture will be on
the subject of counting.",00:00:22.490,00:00:26.380
"So counting, I guess, is
a pretty simple affair",00:00:26.380,00:00:29.620
"conceptually, but it's a
topic that can also get",00:00:29.620,00:00:33.060
to be pretty tricky.,00:00:33.060,00:00:34.410
"The reason we're going to talk
about counting is that there's",00:00:34.410,00:00:37.840
"a lot of probability problems
whose solution actually",00:00:37.840,00:00:41.000
"reduces to successfully counting
the cardinalities of",00:00:41.000,00:00:45.050
various sets.,00:00:45.050,00:00:46.110
"So we're going to see the basic,
simplest methods that",00:00:46.110,00:00:49.270
"one can use to count
systematically in various",00:00:49.270,00:00:52.350
situations.,00:00:52.350,00:00:53.660
"So in contrast to previous
lectures, we're not going to",00:00:53.660,00:00:56.600
"introduce any significant
new concepts of a",00:00:56.600,00:00:59.700
probabilistic nature.,00:00:59.700,00:01:01.460
"We're just going to use the
probability tools that we",00:01:01.460,00:01:04.340
already know.,00:01:04.340,00:01:05.680
"And we're going to apply them
in situations where there's",00:01:05.680,00:01:08.460
also some counting involved.,00:01:08.460,00:01:10.840
"Now, today we're going
to just touch the",00:01:10.840,00:01:13.000
surface of this subject.,00:01:13.000,00:01:14.490
"There's a whole field of
mathematics called",00:01:14.490,00:01:16.650
"combinatorics who are people who
actually spend their whole",00:01:16.650,00:01:19.920
"lives counting more and
more complicated sets.",00:01:19.920,00:01:24.220
"We were not going to get
anywhere close to the full",00:01:24.220,00:01:27.580
"complexity of the field, but
we'll get just enough tools",00:01:27.580,00:01:31.360
"that allow us to address
problems of the type that one",00:01:31.360,00:01:36.260
"encounters in most common
situations.",00:01:36.260,00:01:39.730
"So the basic idea, the basic
principle is something that",00:01:39.730,00:01:43.250
we've already discussed.,00:01:43.250,00:01:45.400
"So counting methods apply in
situations where we have",00:01:45.400,00:01:49.820
"probabilistic experiments with
a finite number of outcomes",00:01:49.820,00:01:53.660
and where every outcome--,00:01:53.660,00:01:56.070
every possible outcome--,00:01:56.070,00:01:57.770
"has the same probability
of occurring.",00:01:57.770,00:02:00.260
"So we have our sample space,
omega, and it's got a bunch of",00:02:00.260,00:02:04.440
discrete points in there.,00:02:04.440,00:02:06.520
"And the cardinality of the set
omega is some capital N. So,",00:02:06.520,00:02:10.539
"in particular, we assume that
the sample points are equally",00:02:10.539,00:02:14.960
"likely, which means that every
element of the sample space",00:02:14.960,00:02:18.490
"has the same probability
equal to 1 over N.",00:02:18.490,00:02:22.420
"And then we are interested in a
subset of the sample space,",00:02:22.420,00:02:26.650
"call it A. And that
subset consists",00:02:26.650,00:02:29.860
of a number of elements.,00:02:29.860,00:02:31.350
"Let the cardinality of that
subset be equal to little n.",00:02:31.350,00:02:36.080
"And then to find the probability
of that set, all",00:02:36.080,00:02:39.370
"we need to do is to add the
probabilities of the",00:02:39.370,00:02:42.060
individual elements.,00:02:42.060,00:02:43.610
"There's little n elements, and
each one has probability one",00:02:43.610,00:02:47.030
"over capital N. And
that's the answer.",00:02:47.030,00:02:50.340
"So this means that to solve
problems in this context, all",00:02:50.340,00:02:53.250
"that we need to be able to do
is to figure out the number",00:02:53.250,00:02:56.580
"capital N and to figure out
the number little n.",00:02:56.580,00:03:00.800
"Now, if somebody gives you a set
by just giving you a list",00:03:00.800,00:03:04.330
"and gives you another set,
again, giving you a list, it's",00:03:04.330,00:03:07.660
easy to count there element.,00:03:07.660,00:03:09.120
"You just count how much
there is on the list.",00:03:09.120,00:03:11.510
"But sometimes the sets are
described in some more",00:03:11.510,00:03:15.030
"implicit way, and we may have to
do a little bit more work.",00:03:15.030,00:03:20.590
There's various tricks that are,00:03:20.590,00:03:22.360
involved in counting properly.,00:03:22.360,00:03:24.410
"And the most common
one is to--",00:03:24.410,00:03:27.080
"when you consider a set of
possible outcomes, to describe",00:03:27.080,00:03:31.350
"the construction of those
possible outcomes through a",00:03:31.350,00:03:33.800
sequential process.,00:03:33.800,00:03:35.440
"So think of a probabilistic
experiment that involves a",00:03:35.440,00:03:38.130
"number of stages, and in each
one of the stages there's a",00:03:38.130,00:03:42.560
"number of possible choices
that there may be.",00:03:42.560,00:03:45.890
"The overall experiment consists
of carrying out all",00:03:45.890,00:03:48.630
the stages to the end.,00:03:48.630,00:03:49.930
"And the number of points in the
sample space is how many",00:03:52.855,00:03:55.830
"final outcomes there can be in
this multi-stage experiment.",00:03:55.830,00:03:59.920
"So in this picture we have an
experiment in which of the",00:03:59.920,00:04:02.910
"first stage we have
four choices.",00:04:02.910,00:04:07.230
"In the second stage, no matter
what happened in the first",00:04:07.230,00:04:11.640
"stage, the way this is drawn
we have three choices.",00:04:11.640,00:04:16.010
"No matter whether we ended up
here, there, or there, we have",00:04:16.010,00:04:19.720
"three choices in the
second stage.",00:04:19.720,00:04:22.860
"And then there's a third stage
and at least in this picture,",00:04:22.860,00:04:27.830
"no matter what happened in the
first two stages, in the third",00:04:27.830,00:04:31.520
"stage we're going to have
two possible choices.",00:04:31.520,00:04:35.930
"So how many leaves are there
at the end of this tree?",00:04:35.930,00:04:41.070
That's simple.,00:04:41.070,00:04:42.170
"It's just the product of
these three numbers.",00:04:42.170,00:04:45.460
"The number of possible leaves
that we have out there is 4",00:04:45.460,00:04:48.520
times 3 times 2.,00:04:48.520,00:04:50.430
"Number of choices at each stage
gets multiplied, and",00:04:50.430,00:04:54.030
"that gives us the number
of overall choices.",00:04:54.030,00:04:57.680
"So this is the general rule, the
general trick that we are",00:04:57.680,00:05:01.230
going to use over and over.,00:05:01.230,00:05:03.520
"So let's apply it to some very
simple problems as a warm up.",00:05:03.520,00:05:07.660
"How many license plates can you
make if you're allowed to",00:05:07.660,00:05:10.530
"use three letters and then
followed by four digits?",00:05:10.530,00:05:17.140
"At least if you're dealing with
the English alphabet, you",00:05:17.140,00:05:20.020
"have 26 choices for
the first letter.",00:05:20.020,00:05:23.460
"Then you have 26 choices
for the second letter.",00:05:23.460,00:05:27.100
"And then 26 choices for
the third letter.",00:05:27.100,00:05:30.300
And then we start the digits.,00:05:30.300,00:05:31.750
"We have 10 choices for the first
digit, 10 choices for",00:05:31.750,00:05:34.970
"the second digit, 10 choices for
the third, 10 choices for",00:05:34.970,00:05:37.780
the last one.,00:05:37.780,00:05:40.030
"Let's make it a little more
complicated, suppose that",00:05:40.030,00:05:43.010
"we're interested in license
plates where no letter can be",00:05:43.010,00:05:47.100
"repeated and no digit
can be repeated.",00:05:47.100,00:05:50.270
"So you have to use different
letters, different digits.",00:05:50.270,00:05:53.040
"How many license plates
can you make?",00:05:53.040,00:05:55.110
"OK, let's choose the
first letter,",00:05:55.110,00:05:56.780
and we have 26 choices.,00:05:56.780,00:05:59.130
"Now, I'm ready to choose my
second letter, how many",00:05:59.130,00:06:02.350
choices do I have?,00:06:02.350,00:06:04.610
"I have 25, because I already
used one letter.",00:06:04.610,00:06:08.090
"I have the 25 remaining letters
to choose from.",00:06:08.090,00:06:11.900
"For the next letter,
how many choices?",00:06:11.900,00:06:14.330
"Well, I used up two of
my letters, so I",00:06:14.330,00:06:17.030
only have 24 available.,00:06:17.030,00:06:19.840
"And then we start with the
digits, 10 choices for the",00:06:19.840,00:06:22.950
"first digit, 9 choices for the
second, 8 for the third, 7 for",00:06:22.950,00:06:26.910
the last one.,00:06:26.910,00:06:28.160
All right.,00:06:30.480,00:06:31.730
"So, now, let's bring some
symbols in a related problem.",00:06:31.730,00:06:38.710
"You are given a set that
consists of n elements and",00:06:38.710,00:06:44.190
"you're supposed to take
those n elements and",00:06:44.190,00:06:47.040
put them in a sequence.,00:06:47.040,00:06:50.050
That is to order them.,00:06:50.050,00:06:52.290
"Any possible ordering of those
elements is called a",00:06:52.290,00:06:56.240
permutation.,00:06:56.240,00:06:57.560
"So for example, if we have the
set 1, 2, 3, 4, a possible",00:06:57.560,00:07:02.630
"permutation is the
list 2, 3, 4, 1.",00:07:02.630,00:07:05.105
"That's one possible
permutation.",00:07:08.560,00:07:10.680
"And there's lots of possible
permutations, of course, the",00:07:10.680,00:07:13.180
"question is how many
are there.",00:07:13.180,00:07:15.560
"OK, let's think about building
this permutation by choosing",00:07:15.560,00:07:20.390
one at a time.,00:07:20.390,00:07:21.460
"Which of these elements goes
into each one of these slots?",00:07:21.460,00:07:26.330
"How many choices for the number
that goes into the",00:07:26.330,00:07:28.740
first slot or the elements?,00:07:28.740,00:07:31.160
"Well, we can choose any one of
the available elements, so we",00:07:31.160,00:07:34.430
have n choices.,00:07:34.430,00:07:35.680
"Let's say this element goes
here, having used up that",00:07:38.650,00:07:42.220
"element, we're left with n minus
1 elements and we can",00:07:42.220,00:07:45.730
"pick any one of these and bring
it into the second slot.",00:07:45.730,00:07:49.530
"So here we have n choices, here
we're going to have n",00:07:49.530,00:07:52.340
"minus 1 choices, then how
many we put there will",00:07:52.340,00:07:55.940
have n minus 2 choices.,00:07:55.940,00:07:58.060
And you go down until the end.,00:07:58.060,00:08:00.220
"What happens at this point
when you are to",00:08:00.220,00:08:02.160
pick the last element?,00:08:02.160,00:08:03.880
"Well, you've used n minus of
them, there's only one",00:08:03.880,00:08:06.650
left in your bag.,00:08:06.650,00:08:08.070
You're forced to use that one.,00:08:08.070,00:08:09.520
"So the last stage, you're going
to have only one choice.",00:08:09.520,00:08:13.920
"So, basically, the number of
possible permutations is the",00:08:13.920,00:08:18.050
"product of all integers
from n down to one, or",00:08:18.050,00:08:21.860
from one up to n.,00:08:21.860,00:08:24.020
"And there's a symbol that we
use for this number, it's",00:08:24.020,00:08:26.550
called n factorial.,00:08:26.550,00:08:29.210
"So n factorial is the number of
permutations of n objects.",00:08:29.210,00:08:32.990
"The number of ways that you can
order n objects that are",00:08:32.990,00:08:37.320
given to you.,00:08:37.320,00:08:39.100
"Now, a different equation.",00:08:39.100,00:08:42.100
We have n elements.,00:08:42.100,00:08:44.310
"Let's say the elements
are 1, 1,2, up to n.",00:08:44.310,00:08:48.680
And it's a set.,00:08:48.680,00:08:51.310
"And we want to create
a subset.",00:08:51.310,00:08:54.490
"How many possible subsets
are there?",00:08:54.490,00:08:58.460
"So speaking of subsets means
looking at each one of the",00:08:58.460,00:09:02.950
"elements and deciding whether
you're going to put it in to",00:09:02.950,00:09:06.880
subsets or not.,00:09:06.880,00:09:08.440
"For example, I could choose
to put 1 in, but 2 I'm not",00:09:08.440,00:09:13.240
"putting it in, 3 I'm not putting
it in, 4 I'm putting",00:09:13.240,00:09:17.100
"it, and so on.",00:09:17.100,00:09:18.630
"So that's how you
create a subset.",00:09:18.630,00:09:21.200
"You look at each one of the
elements and you say, OK, I'm",00:09:21.200,00:09:23.660
"going to put it in the subset,
or I'm not going to put it.",00:09:23.660,00:09:27.310
"So think of these as consisting
of stages.",00:09:27.310,00:09:30.900
"At each stage you look at
one element, and you",00:09:30.900,00:09:33.240
make a binary decision.,00:09:33.240,00:09:35.090
"Do I put it in the
subset, or not?",00:09:35.090,00:09:38.410
"So therefore, how many
subsets are there?",00:09:38.410,00:09:41.940
"Well, I have two choices
for the first element.",00:09:41.940,00:09:45.060
"Am I going to put in
the subset, or not?",00:09:45.060,00:09:47.740
"I have two choices for the
next element, and so on.",00:09:47.740,00:09:50.630
"For each one of the elements,
we have two choices.",00:09:53.450,00:09:57.390
"So the overall number of choices
is 2 to the power n.",00:09:57.390,00:10:02.090
"So, conclusion--",00:10:02.090,00:10:03.710
"the number of subsets, often n
element set, is 2 to the n.",00:10:03.710,00:10:10.150
"So in particular, if we take n
equal to 1, let's check that",00:10:15.050,00:10:20.430
our answer makes sense.,00:10:20.430,00:10:22.190
"If we have n equal to one, how
many subsets does it have?",00:10:22.190,00:10:26.420
"So we're dealing with
a set of just one.",00:10:26.420,00:10:29.675
What are the subsets?,00:10:29.675,00:10:30.925
One subset is this one.,00:10:33.830,00:10:37.290
"Do we have other subsets
of the one element set?",00:10:37.290,00:10:41.530
"Yes, we have the empty set.",00:10:41.530,00:10:43.920
That's the second one.,00:10:43.920,00:10:44.870
"These are the two possible
subsets of",00:10:44.870,00:10:48.860
this particular set.,00:10:48.860,00:10:50.850
"So 2 subsets when n is equal to
1, that checks the answer.",00:10:50.850,00:10:56.790
All right.,00:10:56.790,00:10:58.040
"OK, so having gone so far, we
can do our first example now.",00:11:00.290,00:11:07.590
"So we are given a die
and we're going",00:11:07.590,00:11:12.990
to roll it 6 times.,00:11:12.990,00:11:16.620
"OK, let's make some assumptions
about the rolls.",00:11:16.620,00:11:20.030
"Let's assume that the rolls are
independent, and that the",00:11:20.030,00:11:29.560
die is also fair.,00:11:29.560,00:11:30.985
"So this means that the
probability of any particular",00:11:34.180,00:11:38.110
outcome of the die rolls--,00:11:38.110,00:11:40.350
"for example, so we have 6 rolls,
one particular outcome",00:11:40.350,00:11:43.960
"could be 3,3,1,6,5.",00:11:43.960,00:11:48.760
"So that's one possible
outcome.",00:11:48.760,00:11:51.220
"What's the probability
of this outcome?",00:11:51.220,00:11:54.060
"There's probability 1/6 that
this happens, 1/6 that this",00:11:54.060,00:11:57.470
"happens, 1/6 that this
happens, and so on.",00:11:57.470,00:12:00.530
"So the probability that
the outcome is this",00:12:00.530,00:12:04.250
is 1/6 to the sixth.,00:12:04.250,00:12:07.540
"What did I use to come
up with this answer?",00:12:10.970,00:12:13.690
"I used independence, so I
multiplied the probability of",00:12:13.690,00:12:17.550
"the first roll gives me a 2,
times the probability that the",00:12:17.550,00:12:20.360
"second roll gives me
a 3, and so on.",00:12:20.360,00:12:22.990
"And then I used the assumption
that the die is fair, so that",00:12:22.990,00:12:26.790
"the probability of 2 is
1/6, the probably of 3",00:12:26.790,00:12:30.300
"is 1/6, and so on.",00:12:30.300,00:12:32.240
"So if I were to spell it out,
it's the probability that we",00:12:32.240,00:12:34.810
"get the 2 in the first roll,
times the probability of 3 in",00:12:34.810,00:12:37.740
"the second roll, times the
probability of the",00:12:37.740,00:12:40.850
5 in the last roll.,00:12:40.850,00:12:42.800
"So by independence, I can
multiply probabilities.",00:12:42.800,00:12:46.455
"And because the die is fair,
each one of these numbers is",00:12:46.455,00:12:49.530
1/6 to the sixth.,00:12:49.530,00:12:53.910
"And so the same calculation
would apply no matter what",00:12:53.910,00:12:58.170
numbers I would put in here.,00:12:58.170,00:13:00.610
"So all possible outcomes
are equally likely.",00:13:00.610,00:13:03.920
Let's start with this.,00:13:06.630,00:13:08.400
"So since all possible outcomes
are equally likely to find an",00:13:08.400,00:13:12.650
"answer to a probability
question, if we're dealing",00:13:12.650,00:13:15.870
"with some particular event, so
the event is that all rolls",00:13:15.870,00:13:21.430
give different numbers.,00:13:21.430,00:13:22.900
"That's our event A. And our
sample space is some set",00:13:22.900,00:13:31.160
capital omega.,00:13:31.160,00:13:32.790
"We know that the answer is going
to be the cardinality of",00:13:32.790,00:13:35.890
"the set A, divided by the
cardinality of the set omega.",00:13:35.890,00:13:40.200
"So let's deal with the
easy one first.",00:13:40.200,00:13:42.830
"How many elements are there
in the sample space?",00:13:42.830,00:13:45.960
"How many possible outcomes
are there when you",00:13:45.960,00:13:48.880
roll a dice 6 times?,00:13:48.880,00:13:51.570
"You have 6 choices for
the first roll.",00:13:51.570,00:13:54.600
"You have 6 choices for the
second roll and so on.",00:13:54.600,00:13:57.840
"So the overall number
of outcomes is going",00:13:57.840,00:14:00.330
to be 6 to the sixth.,00:14:00.330,00:14:03.950
"So number of elements in
the sample space is 6",00:14:03.950,00:14:08.200
to the sixth power.,00:14:08.200,00:14:10.470
"And I guess this checks
with this.",00:14:10.470,00:14:14.820
"We have 6 to the sixth outcomes,
each one has this",00:14:14.820,00:14:18.480
"much probability,
so the overall",00:14:18.480,00:14:20.570
probability is equal to one.,00:14:20.570,00:14:23.230
Right?,00:14:23.230,00:14:24.460
"So the probability of an
individual outcome is one over",00:14:24.460,00:14:28.690
"how many possible outcomes
we have, which is this.",00:14:28.690,00:14:32.400
All right.,00:14:32.400,00:14:33.810
So how about the numerator?,00:14:33.810,00:14:36.620
"We are interested in outcomes
in which the numbers that we",00:14:36.620,00:14:42.430
get are all different.,00:14:42.430,00:14:44.585
"So what is an outcome in which
the numbers are all different?",00:14:48.770,00:14:54.080
So the die has 6 faces.,00:14:54.080,00:14:56.310
We roll it 6 times.,00:14:56.310,00:14:58.200
"We're going to get 6
different numbers.",00:14:58.200,00:15:00.340
"This means that we're going to
exhaust all the possible",00:15:00.340,00:15:03.780
"numbers, but they can appear
in any possible sequence.",00:15:03.780,00:15:07.640
"So an outcome that makes this
event happen is a list of the",00:15:07.640,00:15:13.190
"numbers from 1 to 6,
but arranged in",00:15:13.190,00:15:16.250
some arbitrary order.,00:15:16.250,00:15:18.160
"So the possible outcomes that
make event A happen are just",00:15:18.160,00:15:23.200
"the permutations of the
numbers from 1 to 6.",00:15:23.200,00:15:25.990
"One possible outcome that makes
our events to happen--",00:15:31.070,00:15:33.900
it would be this.,00:15:33.900,00:15:35.440
"Here we have 6 possible numbers,
but any other list of",00:15:39.000,00:15:42.050
"this kind in which none
of the numbers is",00:15:42.050,00:15:44.070
repeated would also do.,00:15:44.070,00:15:46.650
"So number of outcomes that make
the event happen is the",00:15:46.650,00:15:51.660
"number of permutations
of 6 elements.",00:15:51.660,00:15:53.980
So it's 6 factorial.,00:15:53.980,00:15:56.060
"And so the final answer is
going to be 6 factorial",00:15:56.060,00:15:59.340
divided by 6 to the sixth.,00:15:59.340,00:16:02.830
"All right, so that's a typical
way that's one solves problems",00:16:02.830,00:16:06.580
of this kind.,00:16:06.580,00:16:07.800
"We know how to count
certain things.",00:16:07.800,00:16:10.660
"For example, here we knew how to
count permutations, and we",00:16:10.660,00:16:14.260
"used our knowledge to count the
elements of the set that",00:16:14.260,00:16:16.830
we need to deal with.,00:16:16.830,00:16:18.080
"So now let's get to a slightly
more difficult problem.",00:16:24.380,00:16:30.970
"We're given once more a
set with n elements.",00:16:30.970,00:16:37.390
"We already know how many subsets
that set has, but now",00:16:40.620,00:16:46.000
"we would be interested in
subsets that have exactly k",00:16:46.000,00:16:50.940
elements in them.,00:16:50.940,00:16:54.480
"So we start with our big set
that has n elements, and we",00:16:54.480,00:17:05.819
"want to construct a subset
that has k elements.",00:17:05.819,00:17:11.890
"Out of those n I'm
going to choose k",00:17:11.890,00:17:14.200
and put them in there.,00:17:14.200,00:17:16.079
"In how many ways
can I do this?",00:17:16.079,00:17:18.180
"More concrete way of thinking
about this problem--",00:17:18.180,00:17:20.710
"you have n people in some group
and you want to form a",00:17:20.710,00:17:24.960
"committee by picking people from
that group, and you want",00:17:24.960,00:17:28.270
"to form a committee
with k people.",00:17:28.270,00:17:31.020
Where k is a given number.,00:17:31.020,00:17:32.460
"For example, a 5 person
committee.",00:17:32.460,00:17:34.670
"How many 5 person committees
are possible if you're",00:17:34.670,00:17:37.510
starting with 100 people?,00:17:37.510,00:17:39.450
"So that's what we
want to count.",00:17:39.450,00:17:40.960
"How many k element subsets
are there?",00:17:40.960,00:17:44.210
"We don't yet know the answer,
but let's give a name to it.",00:17:44.210,00:17:48.030
"And the name is going to be this
particular symbol, which",00:17:48.030,00:17:52.210
we read as n choose k.,00:17:52.210,00:17:55.220
"Out of n elements, we want
to choose k of them.",00:17:55.220,00:18:00.130
OK.,00:18:00.130,00:18:02.000
That may be a little tricky.,00:18:02.000,00:18:04.810
"So what we're going to do is
to instead figure out a",00:18:04.810,00:18:10.170
"somewhat easier problem,
which is going to be--",00:18:10.170,00:18:15.590
"in how many ways can I pick k
out of these people and puts",00:18:15.590,00:18:20.840
them in a particular order?,00:18:20.840,00:18:25.450
"So how many possible ordered
lists can I make that consist",00:18:25.450,00:18:30.430
of k people?,00:18:30.430,00:18:31.840
"By ordered, I mean that we take
those k people and we say",00:18:31.840,00:18:35.240
"this is the first person
in the community.",00:18:35.240,00:18:38.010
"That's the second person
in the committee.",00:18:38.010,00:18:39.600
"That's the third person in
the committee and so on.",00:18:39.600,00:18:42.070
"So in how many ways
can we do this?",00:18:42.070,00:18:46.100
"Out of these n, we want to
choose just k of them and put",00:18:46.100,00:18:50.840
them in slots.,00:18:50.840,00:18:52.010
One after the other.,00:18:52.010,00:18:53.970
"So this is pretty much like the
license plate problem we",00:18:53.970,00:18:57.480
solved just a little earlier.,00:18:57.480,00:19:00.680
"So we have n choices for who
we put as the top person in",00:19:00.680,00:19:06.390
the community.,00:19:06.390,00:19:07.350
"We can pick anyone and have
them be the first person.",00:19:07.350,00:19:11.490
"Then I'm going to choose
the second",00:19:11.490,00:19:13.000
person in the committee.,00:19:13.000,00:19:14.640
I've used up 1 person.,00:19:14.640,00:19:16.700
"So I'm going to have n
minus 1 choices here.",00:19:16.700,00:19:21.530
"And now, at this stage I've used
up 2 people, so I have n",00:19:21.530,00:19:25.840
minus 2 choices here.,00:19:25.840,00:19:28.640
And this keeps going on.,00:19:28.640,00:19:31.240
"Well, what is going to
be the last number?",00:19:31.240,00:19:34.110
Is it's n minus k?,00:19:34.110,00:19:36.310
"Well, not really.",00:19:36.310,00:19:39.980
"I'm starting subtracting numbers
after the second one,",00:19:39.980,00:19:44.090
"so by the end I will have
subtracted k minus 1.",00:19:44.090,00:19:48.250
"So that's how many choices I
will have for the last person.",00:19:48.250,00:19:54.800
"So this is the number
of ways--",00:19:54.800,00:19:58.270
"the product of these numbers
there gives me the number of",00:19:58.270,00:20:02.390
"ways that I can create ordered
lists consisting of k people",00:20:02.390,00:20:08.420
"out of the n that
we started with.",00:20:08.420,00:20:11.700
"Now, you can do a little bit of
algebra and check that this",00:20:11.700,00:20:15.120
"expression here is the same
as that expression.",00:20:15.120,00:20:17.910
Why is this?,00:20:17.910,00:20:19.200
"This factorial has all the
products from 1 up to n.",00:20:19.200,00:20:22.520
"This factorial has all
the products from 1",00:20:22.520,00:20:25.140
up to n minus k.,00:20:25.140,00:20:26.710
So you get cancellations.,00:20:26.710,00:20:28.240
"And what's left is all the
products starting from the",00:20:28.240,00:20:31.860
"next number after here, which
is this particular number.",00:20:31.860,00:20:37.610
"So the number of possible ways
of creating such ordered lists",00:20:37.610,00:20:42.350
"is n factorial divided by
n minus k factorial.",00:20:42.350,00:20:46.330
"Now, a different way that I
could make an ordered list--",00:20:49.480,00:20:53.180
"instead of picking the people
one at a time, I could first",00:20:53.180,00:20:57.950
"choose my k people who are going
to be in the committee,",00:20:57.950,00:21:01.700
and then put them in order.,00:21:01.700,00:21:04.080
"And tell them out of these k,
you are the first, you are the",00:21:04.080,00:21:07.680
"second, you are the third.",00:21:07.680,00:21:10.010
"Starting with this k
people, in how many",00:21:10.010,00:21:12.590
ways can I order them?,00:21:12.590,00:21:15.580
"That's the number
of permutations.",00:21:15.580,00:21:18.150
"Starting with a set with k
objects, in how many ways can",00:21:20.820,00:21:25.180
"I put them in a specific
order?",00:21:25.180,00:21:28.340
"How many specific orders
are there?",00:21:28.340,00:21:31.140
That's basically the question.,00:21:31.140,00:21:32.390
"In how many ways can
I permute these k",00:21:32.390,00:21:34.600
people and arrange them.,00:21:34.600,00:21:36.290
"So the number of ways
that you can do",00:21:36.290,00:21:38.450
this step is k factorial.,00:21:38.450,00:21:42.660
"So in how many ways can I
start with a set with n",00:21:42.660,00:21:48.330
"elements, go through this
process, and end up with a",00:21:48.330,00:21:52.020
sorted list with k elements?,00:21:52.020,00:21:55.560
By the rule that--,00:21:55.560,00:21:57.620
"when we have stages, the total
number of stages is how many",00:21:57.620,00:22:02.160
"choices we had in the first
stage, times how many choices",00:22:02.160,00:22:05.370
we had in the second stage.,00:22:05.370,00:22:08.510
"The number of ways that this
process can happen is this",00:22:08.510,00:22:12.670
times that.,00:22:12.670,00:22:14.890
"This is a different way that
that process could happen.",00:22:14.890,00:22:18.340
"And the number of possible
of ways is this number.",00:22:18.340,00:22:22.640
"No matter which way we carry out
that process, in the end",00:22:22.640,00:22:27.600
"we have the possible ways of
arranging k people out of the",00:22:27.600,00:22:34.610
n that we started with.,00:22:34.610,00:22:36.770
"So the final answer that we get
when we count should be",00:22:36.770,00:22:40.730
"either this, or this
times that.",00:22:40.730,00:22:44.220
"Both are equally valid ways of
counting, so both should give",00:22:44.220,00:22:47.620
us the same answer.,00:22:47.620,00:22:49.050
So we get this equality here.,00:22:49.050,00:22:52.950
"So these two expressions
corresponds to two different",00:22:52.950,00:22:56.370
"ways of constructing ordered
lists of k people starting",00:22:56.370,00:23:01.660
with n people initially.,00:23:01.660,00:23:05.580
"And now that we have this
relation, we can send the k",00:23:05.580,00:23:09.120
factorial to the denominator.,00:23:09.120,00:23:11.540
"And that tells us what
that number, n choose",00:23:11.540,00:23:13.940
"k, is going to be.",00:23:13.940,00:23:16.250
"So this formula-- it's written
here in red, because you're",00:23:16.250,00:23:20.060
"going to see it a zillion
times until",00:23:20.060,00:23:22.150
the end of the semester--,00:23:22.150,00:23:23.740
"they are called the binomial
coefficients.",00:23:23.740,00:23:25.950
"And they tell us the number of
possible ways that we can",00:23:31.170,00:23:34.600
"create a k element subset,
starting with a",00:23:34.600,00:23:38.380
set that has n elements.,00:23:38.380,00:23:41.270
"It's always good to do a sanity
check to formulas by",00:23:41.270,00:23:44.430
considering extreme cases.,00:23:44.430,00:23:46.710
"So let's take the case where
k is equal to n.",00:23:46.710,00:23:52.810
"What's the right answer
in this case?",00:23:56.820,00:23:59.420
"How many n elements subsets
are there out",00:23:59.420,00:24:02.905
of an element set?,00:24:02.905,00:24:04.950
"Well, your subset needs
to include every one.",00:24:04.950,00:24:07.580
You don't have any choices.,00:24:07.580,00:24:09.400
There's only one choice.,00:24:09.400,00:24:10.750
It's the set itself.,00:24:10.750,00:24:12.600
"So the answer should
be equal to 1.",00:24:12.600,00:24:15.700
"That's the number of n element
subsets, starting with a set",00:24:15.700,00:24:19.980
with n elements.,00:24:19.980,00:24:21.340
"Let's see if the formula gives
us the right answer.",00:24:21.340,00:24:25.250
"We have n factorial divided by
k, which is n in our case--",00:24:25.250,00:24:31.750
n factorial.,00:24:31.750,00:24:32.630
"And then n minus k
is 0 factorial.",00:24:32.630,00:24:36.700
"So if our formula is correct, we
should have this equality.",00:24:36.700,00:24:42.070
"And what's the way to
make that correct?",00:24:42.070,00:24:45.620
"Well, it depends what kind
of meaning do we",00:24:45.620,00:24:47.880
give to this symbol?,00:24:47.880,00:24:49.420
"How do we define
zero factorial?",00:24:49.420,00:24:53.510
"I guess in some ways
it's arbitrary.",00:24:53.510,00:24:55.750
"We're going to define it
in a way that makes",00:24:55.750,00:24:58.110
this formula right.,00:24:58.110,00:24:59.640
"So the definition that we will
be using is that whenever you",00:24:59.640,00:25:03.870
"have 0 factorial, it's going
to stand for the number 1.",00:25:03.870,00:25:08.700
"So let's check that this is
also correct, at the other",00:25:08.700,00:25:12.030
extreme case.,00:25:12.030,00:25:13.380
"If we let k equal to 0, what
does the formula give us?",00:25:13.380,00:25:17.670
"It gives us, again, n factorial
divided by 0",00:25:17.670,00:25:20.710
factorial times n factorial.,00:25:20.710,00:25:23.090
"According to our convention,
this again is equal to 1.",00:25:23.090,00:25:27.560
"So there is one subset of our
set that we started with that",00:25:27.560,00:25:33.680
has zero elements.,00:25:33.680,00:25:35.260
Which subset is it?,00:25:35.260,00:25:37.450
It's the empty set.,00:25:37.450,00:25:39.980
"So the empty set is the single
subset of the set that we",00:25:39.980,00:25:45.190
"started with that happens to
have exactly zero elements.",00:25:45.190,00:25:49.360
"So the formula checks in this
extreme case as well.",00:25:49.360,00:25:52.510
So we're comfortable using it.,00:25:52.510,00:25:55.820
"Now these factorials and these
coefficients are really messy",00:25:55.820,00:26:01.180
algebraic objects.,00:26:01.180,00:26:03.050
"There's lots of beautiful
identities that they satisfy,",00:26:03.050,00:26:07.740
"which you can prove
algebraically sometimes by",00:26:07.740,00:26:10.350
"using induction and having
cancellations happen",00:26:10.350,00:26:13.930
all over the place.,00:26:13.930,00:26:15.310
But it's really messy.,00:26:15.310,00:26:17.780
"Sometimes you can bypass those
calculations by being clever",00:26:17.780,00:26:22.540
"and using your understanding
of what these",00:26:22.540,00:26:24.630
coefficients stand for.,00:26:24.630,00:26:26.620
So here's a typical example.,00:26:26.620,00:26:31.490
"What is the sum of those
binomial coefficients?",00:26:31.490,00:26:35.450
"I fix n, and sum over
all possible cases.",00:26:35.450,00:26:40.130
"So if you're an algebra genius,
you're going to take",00:26:40.130,00:26:44.110
"this expression here, plug it in
here, and then start doing",00:26:44.110,00:26:49.830
algebra furiously.,00:26:49.830,00:26:51.460
"And half an hour later, you
may get the right answer.",00:26:51.460,00:26:54.970
"But now let's try
to be clever.",00:26:54.970,00:26:56.425
What does this really do?,00:26:59.470,00:27:01.380
What does that formula count?,00:27:01.380,00:27:04.200
"We're considering k
element subsets.",00:27:04.200,00:27:07.280
That's this number.,00:27:07.280,00:27:09.040
"And we're considering the number
of k element subsets",00:27:09.040,00:27:12.360
for different choices of k.,00:27:12.360,00:27:14.840
"The first term in this sum
counts how many 0-element",00:27:14.840,00:27:18.890
subsets we have.,00:27:18.890,00:27:20.450
"The next term in this sum counts
how many 1-element",00:27:20.450,00:27:23.680
subsets we have.,00:27:23.680,00:27:24.660
"The next term counts how many
2-element subsets we have.",00:27:24.660,00:27:30.010
"So in the end, what
have we counted?",00:27:30.010,00:27:33.130
"We've counted the total
number of subsets.",00:27:33.130,00:27:36.660
"We've considered all possible
cardinalities.",00:27:36.660,00:27:38.430
"We've counted the number
of subsets of size k.",00:27:43.420,00:27:46.850
"We've considered all
possible sizes k.",00:27:46.850,00:27:49.740
"The overall count is
going to be the",00:27:49.740,00:27:52.230
total number of subsets.,00:27:52.230,00:27:54.356
And we know what this is.,00:27:57.880,00:28:00.800
"A couple of slides ago, we
discussed that this number is",00:28:00.800,00:28:03.740
equal to 2 to the n.,00:28:03.740,00:28:05.480
"So, nice, clean and simple
answer, which is easy to guess",00:28:05.480,00:28:11.550
"once you give an interpretation
to the",00:28:11.550,00:28:15.110
"algebraic expression that you
have in front of you.",00:28:15.110,00:28:17.580
All right.,00:28:21.610,00:28:22.280
"So let's move again to sort of
an example in which those",00:28:22.280,00:28:27.410
"binomial coefficients are
going to show up.",00:28:27.410,00:28:31.960
So here's the setting--,00:28:31.960,00:28:34.700
"n independent coin tosses,
and each coin toss has a",00:28:34.700,00:28:40.900
"probability, P, of resulting
in heads.",00:28:40.900,00:28:45.770
"So this is our probabilistic
experiment.",00:28:45.770,00:28:48.320
Suppose we do 6 tosses.,00:28:48.320,00:28:51.200
"What's the probability that we
get this particular sequence",00:28:51.200,00:28:53.980
of outcomes?,00:28:53.980,00:28:56.320
"Because of independence, we
can multiply probability.",00:28:56.320,00:28:59.800
"So it's going to be the
probability that the first",00:28:59.800,00:29:02.400
"toss results in heads, times
the probability that the",00:29:02.400,00:29:05.570
"second toss results in tails,
times the probability that the",00:29:05.570,00:29:08.770
"third one results in tails,
times probability of heads,",00:29:08.770,00:29:12.050
"times probability of heads,
times probability of heads,",00:29:12.050,00:29:14.610
"which is just P to the fourth
times (1 minus P) squared.",00:29:14.610,00:29:20.930
"So that's the probability of
this particular sequence.",00:29:20.930,00:29:24.360
"How about a different
sequence?",00:29:24.360,00:29:26.980
"If I had 4 tails and 2 heads,
but in a different order--",00:29:26.980,00:29:32.830
"let's say if we considered
this particular outcome--",00:29:39.130,00:29:42.870
would the answer be different?,00:29:42.870,00:29:45.480
"We would still have P, times P,
times P, times P, times (1",00:29:45.480,00:29:49.020
"minus P), times (1 minus P).",00:29:49.020,00:29:51.070
"We would get again,
the same answer.",00:29:51.070,00:29:54.670
"So what you observe from just
this example is that, more",00:29:54.670,00:29:59.510
"generally, the probability
of obtaining a particular",00:29:59.510,00:30:03.240
"sequence of heads and tails is
P to a power, equal to the",00:30:03.240,00:30:08.930
number of heads.,00:30:08.930,00:30:10.300
So here we had 4 heads.,00:30:10.300,00:30:12.240
"So there's P to the
fourth showing up.",00:30:12.240,00:30:15.100
"And then (1 minus P) to the
power number of tails.",00:30:15.100,00:30:21.116
So every k head sequence--,00:30:21.116,00:30:26.970
"every outcome in which we have
exactly k heads, has the same",00:30:26.970,00:30:32.310
"probability, which is going to
be P to the k, (1 minus p), to",00:30:32.310,00:30:37.180
the (n minus k).,00:30:37.180,00:30:38.930
"This is the probability of any
particular sequence that has",00:30:38.930,00:30:43.310
exactly k heads.,00:30:43.310,00:30:44.980
"So that's the probability
of a particular",00:30:44.980,00:30:46.980
sequence with k heads.,00:30:46.980,00:30:48.920
"So now let's ask the question,
what is the probability that",00:30:48.920,00:30:53.160
"my experiment results in exactly
k heads, but in some",00:30:53.160,00:30:57.980
arbitrary order?,00:30:57.980,00:30:59.930
"So the heads could
show up anywhere.",00:30:59.930,00:31:02.500
"So there's a number
of different ways",00:31:02.500,00:31:04.080
that this can happen.,00:31:04.080,00:31:05.370
"What's the overall probability
that this event takes place?",00:31:05.370,00:31:11.220
"So the probability of an event
taking place is the sum of the",00:31:11.220,00:31:15.560
"probabilities of all the
individual ways that",00:31:15.560,00:31:19.390
the event can occur.,00:31:19.390,00:31:22.020
"So it's the sum of the
probabilities of all the",00:31:22.020,00:31:24.410
"outcomes that make
the event happen.",00:31:24.410,00:31:27.650
"The different ways that we can
obtain k heads are the number",00:31:27.650,00:31:31.420
"of different sequences that
contain exactly k heads.",00:31:31.420,00:31:37.940
"We just figured out that any
sequence with exactly k heads",00:31:37.940,00:31:44.430
has this probability.,00:31:44.430,00:31:47.110
"So to do this summation, we just
need to take the common",00:31:47.110,00:31:51.110
"probability of each individual
k head sequence, times how",00:31:51.110,00:31:56.030
"many terms we have
in this sum.",00:31:56.030,00:31:58.140
"So what we're left to do now
is to figure out how many k",00:32:01.320,00:32:07.020
head sequences are there.,00:32:07.020,00:32:09.990
"How many outcomes are there in
which we have exactly k heads.",00:32:09.990,00:32:15.448
OK.,00:32:18.940,00:32:21.270
"So what are the ways that I can
describe to you a sequence",00:32:21.270,00:32:27.590
with k heads?,00:32:27.590,00:32:30.600
"I can take my n slots
that corresponds to",00:32:30.600,00:32:34.970
the different tosses.,00:32:34.970,00:32:36.220
"I'm interested in particular
sequences that",00:32:42.920,00:32:45.420
have exactly k heads.,00:32:45.420,00:32:47.750
"So what I need to do is to
choose k slots and assign",00:32:47.750,00:32:53.590
heads to them.,00:32:53.590,00:32:54.850
"So to specify a sequence that
has exactly k heads is the",00:33:05.530,00:33:11.580
"same thing as drawing this
picture and telling you which",00:33:11.580,00:33:17.380
"are the k slots that happened
to have heads.",00:33:17.380,00:33:23.640
"So I need to choose out of those
n slots, k of them, and",00:33:23.640,00:33:30.110
assign them heads.,00:33:30.110,00:33:31.635
"In how many ways can I
choose this k slots?",00:33:31.635,00:33:35.290
"Well, it's the question of
starting with a set of n slots",00:33:35.290,00:33:41.640
"and choosing k slots out
of the n available.",00:33:41.640,00:33:47.080
"So the number of k head
sequences is the same as the",00:33:47.080,00:33:55.540
"number of k element subsets of
the set of slots that we",00:33:55.540,00:34:04.300
"started with, which are
the n slots 1 up to n.",00:34:04.300,00:34:10.520
We know what that number is.,00:34:10.520,00:34:12.800
"We counted, before, the number
of k element subsets, starting",00:34:12.800,00:34:18.770
with a set with n elements.,00:34:18.770,00:34:20.290
"And we gave a symbol to that
number, which is that",00:34:20.290,00:34:23.030
"thing, n choose k.",00:34:23.030,00:34:24.850
"So this is the final answer
that we obtain.",00:34:24.850,00:34:28.110
"So these are the so-called
binomial probabilities.",00:34:28.110,00:34:32.449
"And they gave us the
probabilities for different",00:34:32.449,00:34:35.190
"numbers of heads starting with
a fair coin that's being",00:34:35.190,00:34:39.580
tossed a number of times.,00:34:39.580,00:34:42.050
"This formula is correct, of
course, for reasonable values",00:34:42.050,00:34:46.170
"of k, meaning its correct for
k equals 0, 1, up to n.",00:34:46.170,00:34:52.370
"If k is bigger than n, what's
the probability of k heads?",00:34:52.370,00:34:57.650
"If k is bigger than n, there's
no way to obtain k heads, so",00:34:57.650,00:35:01.340
"that probability is,
of course, zero.",00:35:01.340,00:35:03.480
"So these probabilities only
makes sense for the numbers k",00:35:03.480,00:35:07.610
"that are possible, given
that we have n tosses.",00:35:07.610,00:35:10.405
"And now a question similar
to the one we had in",00:35:13.200,00:35:16.850
the previous slide.,00:35:16.850,00:35:18.480
"If I write down this
summation--",00:35:18.480,00:35:22.910
"even worse algebra than the one
in the previous slide--",00:35:22.910,00:35:28.240
"what do you think this number
will turn out to be?",00:35:28.240,00:35:35.840
"It should be 1 because this
is the probability",00:35:35.840,00:35:39.930
of obtaining k heads.,00:35:39.930,00:35:42.930
"When we do the summation, what
we're doing is we're",00:35:42.930,00:35:45.470
"considering the probability of
0 heads, plus the probability",00:35:45.470,00:35:48.550
"of 1 head, plus the probability
of 2 heads, plus",00:35:48.550,00:35:50.780
the probability of n heads.,00:35:50.780,00:35:52.420
"We've exhausted all the
possibilities in our",00:35:52.420,00:35:54.780
experiment.,00:35:54.780,00:35:55.720
"So the overall probability,
when you exhaust all",00:35:55.720,00:35:58.730
"possibilities, must
be equal to 1.",00:35:58.730,00:36:01.160
"So that's yet another beautiful
formula that",00:36:01.160,00:36:04.180
"evaluates into something
really simple.",00:36:04.180,00:36:06.960
"And if you tried to prove this
identity algebraically, of",00:36:06.960,00:36:11.460
"course, you would have to
suffer quite a bit.",00:36:11.460,00:36:16.030
"So now armed with the binomial
probabilities, we can do the",00:36:16.030,00:36:20.130
harder problems.,00:36:20.130,00:36:21.380
"So let's take the same

"So these 10 tosses
are independent.",00:36:32.610,00:36:37.450

somebody comes and tells us,",00:36:40.000,00:36:43.985

3 heads in the 10",00:36:43.985,00:36:47.890
tosses that you had.,00:36:47.890,00:36:49.688
OK?,00:36:49.688,00:36:50.930

the probability of another",00:36:53.280,00:36:57.450

2 tosses were heads.",00:36:57.450,00:37:01.400
Let's call that event A. OK.,00:37:01.400,00:37:08.990
"So are we in the setting
of discrete",00:37:08.990,00:37:14.320

times, is it the case that all",00:37:16.850,00:37:21.760

of course, heads/heads is",00:37:32.630,00:37:37.170

does not have equally",00:37:49.440,00:37:53.450

Not necessarily.,00:37:57.880,00:37:59.700

inside the event B that we are",00:37:59.700,00:38:04.570
told has occurred.,00:38:04.570,00:38:06.510

also occurred.",00:38:21.830,00:38:26.100

this probability.",00:38:42.970,00:38:47.370

B having occurred, what",00:38:55.800,00:39:01.030
"happens to the probabilities
of the different outcomes",00:39:01.030,00:39:03.740
inside here?,00:39:03.740,00:39:05.430
"Well, conditional probability
laws keep the same proportions",00:39:05.430,00:39:09.790
as the unconditional ones.,00:39:09.790,00:39:11.710

likely when we started, so",00:39:11.710,00:39:15.930
"they're equally likely once we
are told that B has occurred.",00:39:15.930,00:39:21.590
"So to do with this problem, we
need to just transport us to",00:39:21.590,00:39:26.440
"this smaller universe and think
about what's happening",00:39:26.440,00:39:30.680

"So to find the probability of
some subset of that set, we",00:39:39.930,00:39:43.860
"only need to count the
cardinality of B, and count",00:39:43.860,00:39:47.250
"the cardinality of A.
So let's do that.",00:39:47.250,00:39:51.090
Number of outcomes in B--,00:39:51.090,00:39:53.780
"in how many ways can we get
3 heads out of 10 tosses?",00:39:53.780,00:40:00.290
"That's the number we considered
before, and",00:40:00.290,00:40:03.190
it's 10 choose 3.,00:40:03.190,00:40:06.250
"This is the number of
3-head sequences",00:40:06.250,00:40:11.020
when you have 10 tosses.,00:40:11.020,00:40:13.840
"Now let's look at the event A.
The event A is that the first",00:40:13.840,00:40:20.580
"2 tosses where heads, but we're
living now inside this",00:40:20.580,00:40:26.150
"universe B. Given that B
occurred, how many elements",00:40:26.150,00:40:31.220
does A have in there?,00:40:31.220,00:40:34.760
"In how many ways can A happen
inside the B universe.",00:40:34.760,00:40:41.536
"If you're told that the
first 2 were heads--",00:40:41.536,00:40:46.860
sorry.,00:40:46.860,00:40:49.470
"So out of the outcomes in B that
have 3 heads, how many",00:40:49.470,00:40:54.540
start with heads/heads?,00:40:54.540,00:40:56.630
"Well, if it starts with
heads/heads, then the only",00:40:56.630,00:41:00.370
"uncertainty is the location
of the third head.",00:41:00.370,00:41:04.830
"So we started with heads/heads,
we're going to",00:41:04.830,00:41:07.940
"have three heads, the question
is, where is that third head",00:41:07.940,00:41:13.020
going to be.,00:41:13.020,00:41:14.090
It has eight possibilities.,00:41:14.090,00:41:16.540
"So slot 1 is heads, slot 2 is
heads, the third heads can be",00:41:16.540,00:41:20.940
anywhere else.,00:41:20.940,00:41:22.140
"So there's 8 possibilities
for where the third",00:41:22.140,00:41:25.020
head is going to be.,00:41:25.020,00:41:26.270
OK.,00:41:29.630,00:41:31.660
"So what we have counted here is
really the cardinality of A",00:41:31.660,00:41:36.720
"intersection B, which is out of
the elements in B, how many",00:41:36.720,00:41:43.450
"of them make A happen, divided
by the cardinality of B. And",00:41:43.450,00:41:49.410
"that gives us the answer, which
is going to be 10 choose",00:41:49.410,00:41:53.860
"3, divided by 8.",00:41:53.860,00:41:57.530
"And I should probably redraw a
little bit of the picture that",00:41:57.530,00:42:01.330
they have here.,00:42:01.330,00:42:02.510
"The set A is not necessarily
contained in B. It could also",00:42:02.510,00:42:06.690
"have stuff outside B. So the
event that the first 2 tosses",00:42:06.690,00:42:14.750
"are heads can happen with a
total of 3 heads, but it can",00:42:14.750,00:42:18.690
"also happen with a different
total number of heads.",00:42:18.690,00:42:22.650
"But once we are transported
inside the set B, what we need",00:42:22.650,00:42:27.340
"to count is just this part of
A. It's A intersection B and",00:42:27.340,00:42:32.460
"compare it with the total number
of elements in the set",00:42:32.460,00:42:35.180
"B. Did I write it the
opposite way?",00:42:35.180,00:42:40.310
Yes.,00:42:40.310,00:42:41.700
So this is 8 over 10 choose 3.,00:42:41.700,00:42:46.330
OK.,00:42:49.260,00:42:49.640
"So we're going to close with a
more difficult problem now.",00:42:49.640,00:42:52.965
OK.,00:42:57.920,00:43:00.580
"This business of n choose k has
to do with starting with a",00:43:00.580,00:43:05.650
"set and picking a subset
of k elements.",00:43:05.650,00:43:11.350
"Another way of thinking of that
is that we start with a",00:43:11.350,00:43:15.080
"set with n elements and you
choose a subset that has k,",00:43:15.080,00:43:20.770
"which means that there's n
minus k that are left.",00:43:20.770,00:43:24.350
"Picking a subset is the same as
partitioning our set into",00:43:24.350,00:43:29.980
two pieces.,00:43:29.980,00:43:32.510
"Now let's generalize this
question and start counting",00:43:32.510,00:43:36.010
partitions in general.,00:43:36.010,00:43:38.150
"Somebody gives you a set
that has n elements.",00:43:38.150,00:43:42.570
"Somebody gives you also
certain numbers--",00:43:42.570,00:43:44.670
"n1, n2, n3, let's say,
n4, where these",00:43:44.670,00:43:49.400
numbers add up to n.,00:43:49.400,00:43:53.740
"And you're asked to partition
this set into four subsets",00:43:53.740,00:43:58.740
"where each one of the subsets
has this particular",00:43:58.740,00:44:01.450
cardinality.,00:44:01.450,00:44:02.580
"So you're asking to cut it into
four pieces, each one",00:44:02.580,00:44:08.250
"having the prescribed
cardinality.",00:44:08.250,00:44:11.100
"In how many ways can we
do this partitioning?",00:44:11.100,00:44:15.090
"n choose k was the answer when
we partitioned in two pieces,",00:44:15.090,00:44:19.370
"what's the answer
more generally?",00:44:19.370,00:44:21.910
"For a concrete example of a
partition, you have your 52",00:44:21.910,00:44:26.230
"card deck and you deal, as in
bridge, by giving 13 cards to",00:44:26.230,00:44:32.120
each one of the players.,00:44:32.120,00:44:34.000
"Assuming that the dealing is
done fairly and with a well",00:44:34.000,00:44:38.080
"shuffled deck of cards, every
particular partition of the 52",00:44:38.080,00:44:43.790
"cards into four hands, that is
four subsets of 13 each,",00:44:43.790,00:44:50.590
should be equally likely.,00:44:50.590,00:44:52.380
"So we take the 52 cards and we
partition them into subsets of",00:44:52.380,00:44:56.140
"13, 13, 13, and 13.",00:44:56.140,00:44:58.550
"And we assume that all possible
partitions, all",00:44:58.550,00:45:01.020
"possible ways of dealing the
cards are equally likely.",00:45:01.020,00:45:04.240
"So we are again in a setting
where we can use counting,",00:45:04.240,00:45:07.560
"because all the possible
outcomes are equally likely.",00:45:07.560,00:45:10.410
"So an outcome of the experiment
is the hands that",00:45:10.410,00:45:14.050
each player ends up getting.,00:45:14.050,00:45:17.070
"And when you get the cards in
your hands, it doesn't matter",00:45:17.070,00:45:20.170
"in which order that
you got them.",00:45:20.170,00:45:22.000
"It only matters what cards
you have on you.",00:45:22.000,00:45:25.460
"So it only matters which subset
of the cards you got.",00:45:25.460,00:45:31.160
All right.,00:45:31.160,00:45:31.590
"So what's the cardinality of
the sample space in this",00:45:31.590,00:45:35.820
experiment?,00:45:35.820,00:45:37.160
"So let's do it for the concrete
numbers that we have",00:45:37.160,00:45:42.010
"for the problem of partitioning
52 cards.",00:45:42.010,00:45:49.390
"So think of dealing as follows--
you shuffle the deck",00:45:49.390,00:45:52.540
"perfectly, and then you take the
top 13 cards and give them",00:45:52.540,00:45:56.250
to one person.,00:45:56.250,00:45:57.740
"In how many possible hands are
there for that person?",00:45:57.740,00:46:03.230
"Out of the 52 cards, I choose 13
at random and give them to",00:46:03.230,00:46:08.970
the first person.,00:46:08.970,00:46:10.680
"Having done that, what
happens next?",00:46:10.680,00:46:13.260
I'm left with 39 cards.,00:46:13.260,00:46:16.260
"And out of those 39 cards, I
pick 13 of them and give them",00:46:16.260,00:46:20.600
to the second person.,00:46:20.600,00:46:22.250
Now I'm left with 26 cards.,00:46:22.250,00:46:25.790
"Out of those 26, I choose 13,
give them to the third person.",00:46:25.790,00:46:30.920
"And for the last person there
isn't really any choice.",00:46:30.920,00:46:34.040
"Out of the 13, I have to give
that person all 13.",00:46:34.040,00:46:37.890
"And that number is
just equal to 1.",00:46:37.890,00:46:40.230
So we don't care about it.,00:46:40.230,00:46:43.530
All right.,00:46:43.530,00:46:43.910
"So next thing you do is to write
down the formulas for",00:46:43.910,00:46:48.270
these numbers.,00:46:48.270,00:46:49.450
"So, for example, here you
would have 52 factorial,",00:46:49.450,00:46:52.450
"divided by 13 factorial,
times 39",00:46:52.450,00:46:55.880
"factorial, and you continue.",00:46:55.880,00:46:59.040
"And then there are nice
cancellations that happen.",00:46:59.040,00:47:01.310
"This 39 factorial is going to
cancel the 39 factorial that",00:47:01.310,00:47:05.120
"comes from there, and so on.",00:47:05.120,00:47:07.020
"After you do the cancellations
and all the algebra, you're",00:47:07.020,00:47:10.200
"left with this particular
answer, which is the number of",00:47:10.200,00:47:13.380
"possible partitions of 52 cards
into four players where",00:47:13.380,00:47:18.120
"each player gets exactly
13 hands.",00:47:18.120,00:47:21.710
"If you were to generalize this
formula to the setting that we",00:47:21.710,00:47:25.140
"have here, the more general
formula is--",00:47:25.140,00:47:29.200
"you have n factorial, where n is
the number of objects that",00:47:29.200,00:47:33.840
"you are distributing, divided
by the product of the",00:47:33.840,00:47:39.770
factorials of the--,00:47:39.770,00:47:41.840
"OK, here I'm doing it for
the case where we split",00:47:41.840,00:47:46.000
it into four sets.,00:47:46.000,00:47:49.310
"So that would be the answer when
we partition a set into",00:47:49.310,00:47:53.740
"four subsets of prescribed
cardinalities.",00:47:53.740,00:47:57.780
"And you can guess how that
formula would generalize if",00:47:57.780,00:48:00.120
"you want to split it into
five sets or six sets.",00:48:00.120,00:48:03.590
OK.,00:48:03.590,00:48:03.950
"So far we just figured out the
size of the sample space.",00:48:03.950,00:48:10.190
"Now we need to look at our
event, which is the event that",00:48:10.190,00:48:14.660
"each player gets an ace, let's
call that event A. In how many",00:48:14.660,00:48:20.640
ways can that event happens?,00:48:20.640,00:48:22.800
"How many possible hands are
there in which every player",00:48:22.800,00:48:26.970
has exactly one ace?,00:48:26.970,00:48:29.350
"So I need to think about the
sequential process by which I",00:48:29.350,00:48:33.100
"distribute the cards so that
everybody gets exactly one",00:48:33.100,00:48:36.860
"ace, and then try to think
in how many ways can that",00:48:36.860,00:48:40.440
sequential process happen.,00:48:40.440,00:48:42.210
"So one way of making sure that
everybody gets exactly one ace",00:48:42.210,00:48:45.660
is the following--,00:48:45.660,00:48:46.730
"I take the four aces and I
distribute them randomly to",00:48:46.730,00:48:51.210
"the four players, but making
sure that each one gets",00:48:51.210,00:48:53.970
exactly one ace.,00:48:53.970,00:48:55.580
"In how many ways can
that happen?",00:48:55.580,00:48:57.510
"I take the ace of spades and I
send it to a random person out",00:48:57.510,00:49:02.210
of the four.,00:49:02.210,00:49:03.210
So there's 4 choices for this.,00:49:03.210,00:49:07.430
"Then I'm left with 3
aces to distribute.",00:49:07.430,00:49:10.280
"That person already
gotten an ace.",00:49:10.280,00:49:14.050
"I take the next ace, and
I give it to one of",00:49:14.050,00:49:17.270
the 3 people remaining.,00:49:17.270,00:49:19.590
"So there's 3 choices
for how to do that.",00:49:19.590,00:49:22.480
"And then for the next ace,
there's 2 people who have not",00:49:22.480,00:49:26.970
"yet gotten an ace,
and they give it",00:49:26.970,00:49:28.640
randomly to one of them.,00:49:28.640,00:49:30.770
"So these are the possible ways
of distributing for the 4",00:49:30.770,00:49:36.760
"aces, so that each person
gets exactly one.",00:49:36.760,00:49:42.040
"It's actually the same
as this problem.",00:49:42.040,00:49:44.230
"Starting with a set of four
things, in how many ways can I",00:49:44.230,00:49:48.930
"partition them into four subsets
where the first set",00:49:48.930,00:49:53.430
"has one element, the second has
one element, the third one",00:49:53.430,00:49:56.220
"has another element,
and so on.",00:49:56.220,00:49:58.270
"So it agrees with that formula
by giving us 4 factorial.",00:49:58.270,00:50:05.710
OK.,00:50:05.710,00:50:06.040
"So there are different ways
of distributing the aces.",00:50:06.040,00:50:09.400
"And then there's different
ways of distributing the",00:50:09.400,00:50:11.760
remaining 48 cards.,00:50:11.760,00:50:13.460
How many ways are there?,00:50:13.460,00:50:15.110
"Well, I have 48 cards that I'm
going to distribute to four",00:50:15.110,00:50:18.920
"players by giving 12
cards to each one.",00:50:18.920,00:50:22.760
"It's exactly the same question
as the one we had here, except",00:50:22.760,00:50:26.430
"that now it's 48 cards,
12 to each person.",00:50:26.430,00:50:30.230
"And that gives us this
particular count.",00:50:30.230,00:50:33.400
"So putting all that together
gives us the different ways",00:50:33.400,00:50:39.216
"that we can distribute the cards
to the four players so",00:50:39.216,00:50:43.350
"that each one gets
exactly one ace.",00:50:43.350,00:50:45.910
"The number of possible ways
is going to be this four",00:50:45.910,00:50:48.600
"factorial, coming from here,
times this number--",00:50:48.600,00:50:54.610
"this gives us the number of
ways that the event of",00:50:54.610,00:50:56.890
interest can happen--,00:50:56.890,00:50:58.760
"and then the denominator is the
cardinality of our sample",00:50:58.760,00:51:02.760
"space, which is this number.",00:51:02.760,00:51:04.930
"So this looks like
a horrible mess.",00:51:04.930,00:51:07.560
"It turns out that this
expression does simplify to",00:51:07.560,00:51:10.590
"something really,
really simple.",00:51:10.590,00:51:13.180
"And if you look at the textbook
for this problem, you",00:51:13.180,00:51:16.420
"will see an alternative
derivation that gives you a",00:51:16.420,00:51:18.750
"short cut to the same
numerical answer.",00:51:18.750,00:51:22.720
All right.,00:51:22.720,00:51:23.160
"So that basically concludes
chapter one.",00:51:23.160,00:51:25.240
"From next time we're going to
consider introducing random",00:51:25.240,00:51:29.940
"variables and make the subject
even more interesting.",00:51:29.940,00:51:32.950
