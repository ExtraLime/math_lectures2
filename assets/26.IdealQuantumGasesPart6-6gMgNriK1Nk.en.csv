"PROFESSOR: So last
time we started",00:00:21.010,00:00:22.590
talking about superfluid helium.,00:00:22.590,00:00:25.620
"And we said that the
phase diagram of helium-4,",00:00:25.620,00:00:32.070
"the isotope that is a boson
has the following interesting",00:00:32.070,00:00:36.710
properties.,00:00:36.710,00:00:37.700
"First of all, helium
stays a liquid",00:00:37.700,00:00:40.530
"all the way down
to 0 temperature",00:00:40.530,00:00:43.000
"because of the combinations
of its light mass and heat",00:00:43.000,00:00:45.990
interactions.,00:00:45.990,00:00:47.960
"And secondly, that [INAUDIBLE]
to cool down helium",00:00:47.960,00:00:53.970
"through this process
of evaporated cooling,",00:00:53.970,00:00:57.580
"one immediately observes
something interesting",00:00:57.580,00:00:59.550
"happening at temperatures
below 2 degrees",00:00:59.550,00:01:03.200
"Kelvin, where it becomes
this superfluid that",00:01:03.200,00:01:07.020
"has a number of
interesting properties.",00:01:07.020,00:01:10.000
"And in particular as
pertaining to viscosity,",00:01:10.000,00:01:13.430
we made two observations.,00:01:13.430,00:01:15.080
"First of all, you can
make these capillaries--",00:01:15.080,00:01:18.400
"and I'll show you been
movie in more detail later",00:01:18.400,00:01:20.880
"on where it flows through
capillaries as if there",00:01:20.880,00:01:24.710
"is no resistance
and there is nothing",00:01:24.710,00:01:28.440
"that sticks to the walls
of the capillaries.",00:01:28.440,00:01:31.010
"It flows without
viscosity, whereas there",00:01:31.010,00:01:33.770
"was this experiment of
Andronikashvili, in which you",00:01:33.770,00:01:37.190
"had something that
was oscillating",00:01:37.190,00:01:40.080
"and you were calculating
how much of the helium",00:01:40.080,00:01:44.760
"was stuck to the plates
of the container.",00:01:44.760,00:01:47.710
"And the result was
something like this,",00:01:47.710,00:01:50.920
"that is there was a decrease
in the amount of fluid",00:01:50.920,00:01:58.080
that is stuck to the plates.,00:01:58.080,00:01:59.460
"But it doesn't go
immediately down to 0.",00:01:59.460,00:02:02.705
"It has a kind of
form such as this",00:02:02.705,00:02:04.780
"that I will draw more
clearly now and explain.",00:02:04.780,00:02:10.560
"So what we did last time was
to note that people observed",00:02:10.560,00:02:16.250
"that there were
some similarities",00:02:16.250,00:02:17.860
"between this
superfluid transition",00:02:17.860,00:02:20.010
and Bose-Einstein condensation.,00:02:20.010,00:02:22.640
"But what I would
like to highlight",00:02:22.640,00:02:26.360
"in the beginning
of this lecture is",00:02:26.360,00:02:28.200
"that there are also very
important differences.",00:02:28.200,00:02:32.450
"So let's think about
these distinctions",00:02:32.450,00:02:40.310
"between Bose-Einstein condensate
add the superfluid helium.",00:02:40.310,00:02:48.126
"One set of things we would
like to take from the picture",00:02:58.690,00:03:05.120
"that I have over there, which
is diffraction of the fluid that",00:03:05.120,00:03:12.660
"is stuck to the plates
and in some sense",00:03:12.660,00:03:15.370
behaves like a normal fluid.,00:03:15.370,00:03:19.030
"Now let me make the analogy
to Bose-Einstein condensation.",00:03:19.030,00:03:24.050
"You know that in the
Bose-Einstein condensation",00:03:24.050,00:03:27.400
"there was also this phenomenon
that there was a separation",00:03:27.400,00:03:32.260
"into two parts of
the total density.",00:03:32.260,00:03:36.230
"And be regarded as a
function of temperature",00:03:36.230,00:03:39.650
"some part of the density as
belonging to the normal state.",00:03:39.650,00:03:45.750
"So when you are above
Tc of n, everything",00:03:45.750,00:03:50.840
is essentially normal.,00:03:50.840,00:03:53.860
"And then what happens is
that when you hit Tc of n",00:03:53.860,00:04:02.600
"you can no longer put
all of the particles",00:04:02.600,00:04:07.530
"that you have in
the excited states.",00:04:07.530,00:04:11.320
"So the fraction that goes
in the excited states",00:04:11.320,00:04:13.870
"goes down and eventually
goes to 0 at 0 temperature.",00:04:13.870,00:04:20.590
"And essentially, this would
be the reverse of the curve",00:04:23.460,00:04:31.770
"that we have in that
figure over there.",00:04:31.770,00:04:34.180
"Basically, there's
a portion that",00:04:37.320,00:04:39.610
"would be the normal part that
would be looking like this.",00:04:39.610,00:04:42.940
"Now, the way that we
obtained this result",00:04:46.040,00:04:52.430
"was that basically there
was a fraction that",00:04:52.430,00:04:54.860
was in the normal state.,00:04:54.860,00:04:57.100
"The part that was
excited was described",00:04:57.100,00:05:00.040
"by this simple formula that was
g over lambda cubed [INAUDIBLE]",00:05:00.040,00:05:05.500
of 3/2.,00:05:05.500,00:05:07.410
So it went to 0 as T to the 3/2.,00:05:07.410,00:05:10.960
"So basically, the
proportionality",00:05:10.960,00:05:12.990
here is T to the 3/2.,00:05:12.990,00:05:16.040
"And then basically,
the curve would",00:05:16.040,00:05:17.950
"come down here and
go to 0 linearly.",00:05:17.950,00:05:22.270
"Now what is shown
in the experiment",00:05:22.270,00:05:26.260
"is that the curve
actually goes to 0",00:05:26.260,00:05:30.000
in a much more sharp fashion.,00:05:30.000,00:05:33.600
"And actually, when people try
to fit a curve through this,",00:05:33.600,00:05:40.250
"the curve looks something like
Tc minus T to the 2/3 over.",00:05:40.250,00:05:44.010
"But also it goes to 0 much
more rapidly than the curve",00:05:48.410,00:05:54.140
"that we have for
Bose-Einstein condensation.",00:05:54.140,00:05:57.100
"Indeed, it goes through
0 proportionately to T",00:05:57.100,00:05:59.900
to the fourth.,00:05:59.900,00:06:02.650
"And so that's something that we
need to understand and explain.",00:06:02.650,00:06:06.100
"Now all of the properties of
the Bose-Einstein condensate",00:06:12.200,00:06:18.070
"was very easy to
describe once we realized",00:06:18.070,00:06:21.840
"that all of the things that
correspond to excitation,",00:06:21.840,00:06:26.010
"such as the energy,
heat capacity,",00:06:26.010,00:06:28.500
"pressure, come from
this fraction that",00:06:28.500,00:06:32.350
is in the excited state.,00:06:32.350,00:06:35.210
"And we can calculate,
say, the contribution",00:06:35.210,00:06:39.010
"to energy heat
capacity, et cetera.",00:06:39.010,00:06:42.060
"And in particular, if we look
at the behavior of the heat",00:06:42.060,00:06:45.730
"capacity as a function
of temperature,",00:06:45.730,00:06:50.400
"for this Bose-Einstein
condensate, the behavior",00:06:50.400,00:06:57.240
"that we had was that again
simply at low temperatures",00:06:57.240,00:07:01.090
"it was going proportionately
to T to the 3/2,",00:07:01.090,00:07:08.000
"because this was the number
of excitations that you had.",00:07:08.000,00:07:12.160
"So these two T to the
3/2 are very much related",00:07:12.160,00:07:15.090
to each other.,00:07:15.090,00:07:16.960
"And then this curve would
basically go along its way",00:07:16.960,00:07:22.300
"until it hit Tc of
n at some point.",00:07:22.300,00:07:26.450
"And we separately
calculated the behavior",00:07:26.450,00:07:28.930
coming from high temperatures.,00:07:28.930,00:07:30.640
"And the behavior from
high temperatures",00:07:30.640,00:07:33.140
"would start with
the classical result",00:07:33.140,00:07:35.480
"that the heat capacity
is 3/2 per particle",00:07:35.480,00:07:39.500
"due to the kinetic energy that
you can put in these things.",00:07:39.500,00:07:42.800
"And then it would rise, and it
would then join this curve over",00:07:42.800,00:07:46.327
here.,00:07:46.327,00:07:49.189
"Now when you look at the
actual heat capacity,",00:07:49.189,00:07:54.760
"indeed the shape up
the heat capacity",00:07:54.760,00:07:57.380
"is the thing that gives this
transition the name of a lambda",00:07:57.380,00:08:01.370
transition.,00:08:01.370,00:08:02.180
It kind of looks like a lambda.,00:08:02.180,00:08:03.805
"And at Tc there are
divergences approaching",00:08:09.090,00:08:13.390
"from the two sides that
behave like the log.",00:08:13.390,00:08:17.600
"And again more
importantly, what we",00:08:24.450,00:08:27.680
"find is that at
0 temperature, it",00:08:27.680,00:08:30.770
"doesn't go through 0, the
heat capacity as T to the 3/2,",00:08:30.770,00:08:34.730
"but rather as T to
the third power.",00:08:34.730,00:08:38.909
"So the red curve
corresponds to superfluid,",00:08:38.909,00:08:46.060
"the green curve corresponds
to Bose-Einstein condensate.",00:08:46.060,00:08:51.710
"And so they're clearly
different from each other.",00:08:51.710,00:08:56.550
"So that's what we would
like you to understand.",00:08:56.550,00:09:00.980
"Well the thing that is easiest
to understand and figure out",00:09:00.980,00:09:07.010
"is the difference between
these heat capacities.",00:09:07.010,00:09:10.780
"And the reason for that
is that we had already",00:09:10.780,00:09:13.510
"seen a form that was of
the heat capacity that",00:09:13.510,00:09:17.400
behaved like T cubed.,00:09:17.400,00:09:18.600
"That was when we were looking
at phonons in a solid.",00:09:18.600,00:09:23.050
"So let's remind
you why was it that",00:09:23.050,00:09:25.880
"for the Bose-Einstein
condensate we",00:09:25.880,00:09:28.740
"were getting this T
to the 3/2 behavior?",00:09:28.740,00:09:34.010
"The reason for that was that
the various excitations,",00:09:34.010,00:09:38.520
"I could plot as a function
of k, or p, which is h bar k.",00:09:38.520,00:09:46.612
"They're very much
related to each other.",00:09:46.612,00:09:49.450
"And for the
Bose-Einstein condensate,",00:09:49.450,00:09:53.890
"the form was simply
a parabola, which",00:09:53.890,00:09:58.310
"is this p squared over
2 mass of the helium.",00:09:58.310,00:10:03.144
"Let's say, assuming that
what we are dealing with",00:10:03.144,00:10:06.330
"is non-interacting particles
with mass of helium.",00:10:06.330,00:10:12.620
"And this parabolic
curve essentially",00:10:12.620,00:10:17.390
"told us that various quantities
behave as T to the 3/2.",00:10:17.390,00:10:28.050
"Roughly, the idea is that
at some temperature that",00:10:28.050,00:10:32.920
"has energy of the order
of kT, you figure out",00:10:32.920,00:10:37.520
how far you have excited things.,00:10:37.520,00:10:41.800
"And since this
form is a parabola,",00:10:41.800,00:10:45.000
"the typical p is going to
scale like T to the 1/2.",00:10:45.000,00:10:48.700
"You have a volume in three
dimensions in p space.",00:10:51.220,00:10:55.810
"If the radius goes
like T to the 1/2,",00:10:55.810,00:10:59.110
"the volume goes
like T to the 3/2.",00:10:59.110,00:11:02.030
"That's why you have all kinds
of excitations such as this.",00:11:02.030,00:11:04.880
"And the reason for the
Bose-Einstein condensation",00:11:08.150,00:11:13.090
"was that you would start to fill
out all of these excitations.",00:11:13.090,00:11:19.790
"And when you were adding all
of the mean occupation numbers,",00:11:19.790,00:11:25.430
"the answer was not
coming up all the way",00:11:25.430,00:11:27.783
"to the total number
of particles.",00:11:27.783,00:11:29.800
"So then you have to put
an excess at p close",00:11:29.800,00:11:32.400
"to 0, which corresponds to the
ground state of this system.",00:11:32.400,00:11:35.880
"Now of course when
you look at helium,",00:11:38.680,00:11:41.090
"helium molecules, helium
atoms have the interactions",00:11:41.090,00:11:44.310
between them that we discussed.,00:11:44.310,00:11:46.440
"In particular, you can't really
put them on top of each other.",00:11:46.440,00:11:50.130
"There is a hard exclusion
when you bring things",00:11:50.130,00:11:53.150
close to each other.,00:11:53.150,00:11:55.460
"So the ground
state of the system",00:11:55.460,00:11:58.470
"must look very different
from the ground state",00:11:58.470,00:12:00.760
"of the Bose-Einstein condensate
in which the particles freely",00:12:00.760,00:12:04.180
occupy the entire box.,00:12:04.180,00:12:08.000
"So there is a very
difficult story",00:12:08.000,00:12:12.030
"associated with
figuring out what",00:12:12.030,00:12:15.020
"the ground state of this
combination of interacting",00:12:15.020,00:12:18.930
"particles that make
up liquid helium is.",00:12:18.930,00:12:22.880
What is the behavior?,00:12:22.880,00:12:23.930
"What's the many-body wave
function at 0 temperature?",00:12:23.930,00:12:26.260
"Now as we see here, in order
to understand the heat capacity",00:12:29.470,00:12:34.630
"we really don't
need to know what",00:12:34.630,00:12:37.130
"is happening at
the ground state.",00:12:37.130,00:12:40.060
"What we need to know in
order to find heat capacity",00:12:40.060,00:12:43.350
"is how to put more energy in the
system above the ground state.",00:12:43.350,00:12:47.170
"So we need to know
something about excitations.",00:12:47.170,00:12:51.090
"And so that's the
perspective that Landau took.",00:12:51.090,00:12:54.930
"Landau said, well, this is
the spectrum of excitations",00:12:54.930,00:12:58.900
"if you had [? plain ?] particles
without any interactions.",00:12:58.900,00:13:03.470
"Let's imagine what
happens if we gradually",00:13:03.470,00:13:06.120
"tune in the interactions,
the particles",00:13:06.120,00:13:08.220
"start to repel each
other, et cetera.",00:13:08.220,00:13:10.960
"This non-interacting
ground state",00:13:10.960,00:13:13.120
"that we had in which the
particles were uniformly",00:13:13.120,00:13:16.480
"distributed across
the system will",00:13:16.480,00:13:18.590
"evolve into some complicated
ground state I don't know.",00:13:18.590,00:13:22.910
"And then, presumably
there would be a spectrum",00:13:22.910,00:13:25.210
"of excitations around
that ground state.",00:13:25.210,00:13:30.260
"Now the excitations around
the non-interacting ground",00:13:30.260,00:13:34.760
"state we can label by
this momentum peak.",00:13:34.760,00:13:39.250
"And it kind of
makes sense that we",00:13:39.250,00:13:40.990
"should be able to have a
singular label for excitations",00:13:40.990,00:13:45.080
"around the ground state of
these interacting particles.",00:13:45.080,00:13:48.850
"And this is where
you sort of needed",00:13:48.850,00:13:50.550
"a little bit of Landau's
type of insight.",00:13:50.550,00:13:53.330
"He said, well,
presumably what you",00:13:53.330,00:13:55.590
"do when you have
excitations of momentum p",00:13:55.590,00:13:59.770
"is to distort the wave
function in a manner that",00:13:59.770,00:14:03.940
"is consistent with having these
kind of excitations of momentum",00:14:03.940,00:14:10.330
p.,00:14:10.330,00:14:11.580
"And he said, well
we typically know",00:14:11.580,00:14:14.680
"that if you have
a fluid or a solid",00:14:14.680,00:14:17.990
"and we want to impart some
momentum above the ground",00:14:17.990,00:14:21.850
"state, if will go in
the form of phonons.",00:14:21.850,00:14:24.870
"These are distortions in
which the density will",00:14:24.870,00:14:28.870
"vary in some sinusoidal or
cosine way across the system.",00:14:28.870,00:14:35.060
"So he said that maybe
what is happening",00:14:35.060,00:14:37.920
"is that for these
excitations you",00:14:37.920,00:14:40.370
"have to take what ever this
interacting ground state is--",00:14:40.370,00:14:43.730
"which we don't know and
can't write that down--",00:14:43.730,00:14:47.590
"but hope that
excitations around it",00:14:47.590,00:14:49.900
"correspond to these
distortions in density.",00:14:49.900,00:14:52.950
"And that by analogy with
what happens for fluids,",00:14:52.950,00:14:56.410
"that the spectrum of excitations
will then become a linear.",00:14:56.410,00:15:01.350
"You would have something
like a sound wave",00:15:01.350,00:15:04.240
"that you would have in
a liquid or a solid.",00:15:04.240,00:15:07.060
"So if you do this, if you
have a linear spectrum",00:15:07.060,00:15:14.290
then we can see what happen.,00:15:14.290,00:15:16.895
"For a particular energy
of the order of kT,",00:15:16.895,00:15:21.540
"we will go here,
occupied momenta that",00:15:21.540,00:15:24.670
"would be of the order
of kT over H bar.",00:15:24.670,00:15:27.160
"The number of excitations would
be something like this cubed,",00:15:30.920,00:15:35.560
"and so you would
imagine that you",00:15:35.560,00:15:37.300
"would get a heat capacity that
is proportional to this times",00:15:37.300,00:15:41.000
kB.,00:15:41.000,00:15:42.870
"And if you do things
correctly, like really",00:15:42.870,00:15:45.570
"for the case of
phonons or photons,",00:15:45.570,00:15:47.840
"you can even figure out what
the numerical prefactor is here.",00:15:47.840,00:15:52.010
"And there's a velocity
here because this curve",00:15:52.010,00:15:56.240
goes like H bar vP.,00:15:56.240,00:15:59.280
"So then you can
compare what you have",00:16:05.980,00:16:09.010
"over here with the coefficient
of the T cubed over here,",00:16:09.010,00:16:15.330
"and you could even figure
out what this velocity is.",00:16:15.330,00:16:19.140
"And it turns out to be of the
order of 240 meters per second.",00:16:19.140,00:16:23.030
"A typical sound wave that
you would have in a fluid.",00:16:27.640,00:16:31.450
"So that's kind of
a reasonable thing.",00:16:31.450,00:16:35.390
"Now of course, when you go
to higher and higher momenta,",00:16:35.390,00:16:38.700
"it corresponds to essentially
shorter and shorter",00:16:38.700,00:16:41.420
wavelengths.,00:16:41.420,00:16:42.520
"You expect that when
you get wavelengths",00:16:42.520,00:16:44.880
"that is of the order of
the interatomic spacing,",00:16:44.880,00:16:49.860
"then the interactions become
less and less important.",00:16:49.860,00:16:52.670
"You have particles
rattling in a cage",00:16:52.670,00:16:55.080
"that is set up by
everybody else.",00:16:55.080,00:16:57.230
"And then you should regain
this kind of spectrum",00:16:57.230,00:17:00.320
at high values of momentum.,00:17:00.320,00:17:03.120
"And so what Landau
did was he basically",00:17:03.120,00:17:06.920
"joined these things
together and posed",00:17:06.920,00:17:10.270
"that there is a spectrum
such as this that",00:17:10.270,00:17:14.760
"has what is called
a phonon part, which",00:17:14.760,00:17:17.310
"is this linear part where
energy goes like H bar,",00:17:17.310,00:17:24.359
"like the velocity
times the momentum.",00:17:24.359,00:17:30.290
"And it has a part that in
the vicinity of this point,",00:17:30.290,00:17:35.010
you can expand parabolically.,00:17:35.010,00:17:37.930
And it's called rotons.,00:17:37.930,00:17:38.960
"There is a gap
delta, and then H bar",00:17:41.900,00:17:46.690
"squared over 2, some effective
mass, k minus k0 squared.",00:17:46.690,00:17:52.390
"This k0 turns out to
be roughly of the order",00:17:54.970,00:17:58.110
"of the inverse
[INAUDIBLE], two Angstrom",00:17:58.110,00:18:00.930
"inverse, between particles.",00:18:00.930,00:18:04.470
"This mu is of the order
of mass of [INAUDIBLE].",00:18:04.470,00:18:09.430
"So about 10 years
or so after Landau,",00:18:14.580,00:18:21.330
"people are able to get to this
whole spectrum of excitation",00:18:21.330,00:18:25.540
"through neutron scattering
and other scattering",00:18:25.540,00:18:29.330
types of experiments.,00:18:29.330,00:18:30.700

was confirmed.",00:18:30.700,00:18:33.160

three-dimensional space.",00:23:00.460,00:23:04.680

uniquely invertible.",00:23:15.340,00:23:18.840

spectrum only depends on,",00:23:27.932,00:23:30.307

the three-dimensional components",00:23:30.307,00:23:33.344

it's much easier",00:23:33.344,00:23:36.296

know, because you",00:23:39.531,00:23:41.030

I have to change perspective",00:24:39.010,00:24:43.990

over k or an integral over p.",00:24:43.990,00:24:49.520

function of shape.",00:24:57.390,00:25:00.920

boundary conditions",00:25:00.920,00:25:03.540

conditions, et cetera,",00:25:03.540,00:25:06.930

different over here.",00:25:06.930,00:25:10.882
"But by the time you
go to the continuum,",00:25:10.882,00:25:14.190
"it's a property
of dimension only.",00:25:14.190,00:25:17.520
"It doesn't really depend
on the underlying shape.",00:25:17.520,00:25:20.673

still change sums",00:25:20.673,00:25:22.048

the same rules?",00:25:22.048,00:25:23.650

"It's a sort of general
density of state property.",00:25:26.550,00:25:30.780
"So there's some nice
formula that tells you",00:25:30.780,00:25:34.060
"what the density of state
is for an arbitrary shape,",00:25:34.060,00:25:38.110

always proportional to volume",00:25:38.110,00:25:41.740
"or area [INAUDIBLE]
the density of state",00:25:41.740,00:25:44.260
that you have been calculating.,00:25:44.260,00:25:46.180

some leading terms",00:25:46.180,00:25:47.910
"that are proportional to
if it is volume to area,",00:25:47.910,00:25:52.140
"or number of edges, et cetera.",00:25:52.140,00:25:55.260
"But those are kind of subleading
the thermodynamic sense.",00:25:55.260,00:25:58.626

did a lot of work",00:26:04.500,00:26:09.050
"on formalizing these
ideas of Landau getting",00:26:09.050,00:26:15.100

about the spectrum.",00:26:19.600,00:26:22.090

"And he was worried
that somehow he",00:26:29.920,00:26:31.890
"couldn't get this
logarithmic divergence.",00:26:31.890,00:26:35.060
"And that bothered
him a little bit,",00:26:35.060,00:26:37.080
"but Onsager told him
that that's really",00:26:37.080,00:26:39.990
"a much more fundamental
property that",00:26:39.990,00:26:42.280
"depends on critical phenomena,
and for resolving that issue,",00:26:42.280,00:26:45.960
you have to come to 8.334.,00:26:45.960,00:26:49.700
"So we will not discuss
that, nor will we",00:26:49.700,00:26:52.460
"discuss why this is Tc minus
T to the 2/3 power and not",00:26:52.460,00:26:57.165
a linear dependence.,00:26:57.165,00:26:58.820
"It again is one of these
critical properties.",00:26:58.820,00:27:01.910
"But we should be able to
explain this T to the fourth.",00:27:01.910,00:27:06.180
"And clearly, this
T to the fourth",00:27:06.180,00:27:07.900
"is not as simple as saying this
exponent changed from 3/2 to 3,",00:27:07.900,00:27:13.880
"this 3/2 should
also change the 3.",00:27:13.880,00:27:16.060
"No, it went to T to the fourth,
so what's going on over here?",00:27:16.060,00:27:21.420
"So last time at the
end of the lecture",00:27:21.420,00:27:24.580
"I wrote a statement that
the BEC is not superfluid.",00:27:24.580,00:27:35.100
"And what that really
means is that it",00:27:40.310,00:27:44.110
"has too many excitations,
low energy excitations.",00:27:44.110,00:27:48.646
"So imagine the
following, that maybe we",00:27:56.410,00:27:59.630
"have a container-- I don't
know, maybe we have a tube--",00:27:59.630,00:28:03.650
"and we have our superfluid going
through this with velocity v",00:28:03.650,00:28:13.480
sub s.,00:28:13.480,00:28:15.390
"We want it to maintain that
velocity without experiencing",00:28:15.390,00:28:21.660
"friction, which it
seems to do in going",00:28:21.660,00:28:23.870
through these capillaries.,00:28:23.870,00:28:25.050
"You don't have to push it, it
seems to be going by itself.",00:28:25.050,00:28:29.580
"And so the question is,
can any of these pictures",00:28:29.580,00:28:36.480
"that we drew for excitations
be consistent with this?",00:28:36.480,00:28:42.230
"Now, why am I talking about
excitations and consistency",00:28:42.230,00:28:45.690
with superfluid?,00:28:45.690,00:28:47.810
"Because what can
happen in principle",00:28:47.810,00:28:51.440
"is that within your system,
you can spontaneously",00:28:51.440,00:28:57.190
generate some excitation.,00:28:57.190,00:29:00.120
"This excitation will
have some momentum p",00:29:00.120,00:29:04.120
and some energy epsilon of p.,00:29:04.120,00:29:08.410
"And if you spontaneously can
create these excitations that",00:29:08.410,00:29:13.500
"would take away energy from this
kinetic energy of the flowing",00:29:13.500,00:29:19.310
"superfluid, gradually the
superfluid will slow down.",00:29:19.310,00:29:23.950
"Its energy will be
dissipated and the superfluid",00:29:23.950,00:29:27.420
"itself will heat up
because you generated",00:29:27.420,00:29:29.997
these excitations with it.,00:29:29.997,00:29:31.080
So let's see what happens.,00:29:34.000,00:29:38.690
"If I were to create
such an excitation,",00:29:38.690,00:29:42.750
"actually I have to worry
about momentum conservation",00:29:42.750,00:29:51.320
"because I created something
that carried momentum p.",00:29:51.320,00:29:56.120
"Now initially, let's say
that this whole entity, all",00:29:56.120,00:30:04.690
"of the fluid that are
superflowing with velocity Vs",00:30:04.690,00:30:08.330
"have mass M. So the initial
momentum would be MVs.",00:30:08.330,00:30:13.055
"Now, I created some
excitation that",00:30:16.280,00:30:21.280
"is carrying away
some momentum p.",00:30:21.280,00:30:24.970
"So the only thing that
can ensure this happens",00:30:24.970,00:30:28.740
"is that I have to
slightly change",00:30:28.740,00:30:32.510
the velocity of the fluid.,00:30:32.510,00:30:34.285
"Now this change in
velocity is infinitesimal.",00:30:37.240,00:30:40.425
"It is Vs minus p
divided by M. M is huge,",00:30:40.425,00:30:48.470
"so why bother
thinking about this?",00:30:48.470,00:30:53.292
"Well, let's see what
the change in energy is.",00:30:53.292,00:30:57.040
"Delta E. Let's say, well,
you created this excitation",00:31:02.250,00:31:07.160
so you have energy epsilon of p.,00:31:07.160,00:31:09.280
"But I say, in
addition to that there",00:31:12.310,00:31:15.295
"is a change in the kinetic
energy of the superfluid.",00:31:15.295,00:31:20.500
"I'm now moving at
Vs prime squared,",00:31:20.500,00:31:23.830
"whereas initially when this
excitation was not present,",00:31:23.830,00:31:28.130
I was moving at Vs.,00:31:28.130,00:31:32.650
And so what do you have here?,00:31:32.650,00:31:36.300
"We have epsilon of p, M
over 2 Vs minus p over M,",00:31:36.300,00:31:44.566
"this infinitesimal change
in velocity squared minus M",00:31:44.566,00:31:49.920
over 2 Vs squared.,00:31:49.920,00:31:53.760
"We can see that the leading
order of the kinetic energy",00:31:53.760,00:31:56.830
"goes away, but that there
is a cross term here",00:31:56.830,00:32:01.780
"in which the M contribution--
the contribution of the mass--",00:32:01.780,00:32:05.660
goes away.,00:32:05.660,00:32:07.460
"And so the change in energy is
actually something like this.",00:32:07.460,00:32:15.140
"So if I had a system that
when stationary, the energy",00:32:18.020,00:32:25.330
"to create an excitation of
momentum p was epsilon of p,",00:32:25.330,00:32:30.830
"when I put that in a frame that
is moving with some velocity",00:32:30.830,00:32:35.960
"Vs, you have the
ability to borrow",00:32:35.960,00:32:40.250
"some of that kinetic energy
and the excitation energy",00:32:40.250,00:32:45.040
goes down by this amount.,00:32:45.040,00:32:47.045
"So what happens if I take
the Bose-Einstein type",00:32:58.610,00:33:07.330
"of excitation spectrum
that is p squared over 2M",00:33:07.330,00:33:10.810
"and then subtract
a v dot p from it?",00:33:10.810,00:33:15.860
"Essentially there is a
linear subtraction going on,",00:33:15.860,00:33:20.520
"and I would get a
curve such as this.",00:33:20.520,00:33:24.870
"So I probably exaggerated
this by a lot.",00:33:24.870,00:33:28.630
"I shouldn't have
subtracted so much.",00:33:28.630,00:33:31.150
"Let me actually not
subject so much,",00:33:31.150,00:33:37.590
"because we don't want to go
all the way in that range.",00:33:37.590,00:33:40.260
"But you can see that there
is a range of momenta where",00:33:45.860,00:33:50.590
"you would spontaneously gain
energy by creating excitations.",00:33:50.590,00:33:56.710
"If the spectrum was
initially p squared over 2M,",00:33:56.710,00:34:00.630
"basically you just have too
many low energy excitations.",00:34:00.630,00:34:05.430
"As soon as you
start moving it, you",00:34:05.430,00:34:07.960
"will spontaneously
excite these things.",00:34:07.960,00:34:11.280
"Even if you were initially
at 0 temperature,",00:34:11.280,00:34:14.080
"these phonon excitations
would be created spontaneously",00:34:14.080,00:34:18.340
in your system.,00:34:18.340,00:34:19.159
"They would move
all over the place.",00:34:19.159,00:34:20.840
They would heat up your system.,00:34:20.840,00:34:22.610
"There is no way
that you can pass",00:34:22.610,00:34:25.800
"the Bose-Einstein
condensate-- actually,",00:34:25.800,00:34:28.889
"there's no way that you can even
move it without losing energy.",00:34:28.889,00:34:32.350
"But you can see that
this red curve does not",00:34:35.300,00:34:38.900
have that difficulty.,00:34:38.900,00:34:40.830
"If I were to shift this curve
by an amount that is linear,",00:34:40.830,00:34:44.580
what do I get?,00:34:44.580,00:34:45.520
I will get something like this.,00:34:45.520,00:34:47.202
"So the Landau spectrum
is perfectly fine",00:34:53.880,00:35:00.030
"as far as excitations
is concerned.",00:35:00.030,00:35:04.980
"At zero temperature, even if the
whole fluid is moving then it",00:35:04.980,00:35:11.010
"cannot spontaneously
create excitations,",00:35:11.010,00:35:14.440
"because you would increase
energy of the system.",00:35:14.440,00:35:17.490
So there's this difference.,00:35:20.230,00:35:22.530
"Ultimately, you would
say that the first time",00:35:22.530,00:35:25.430
"you would get excitation is
if you move it fast enough",00:35:25.430,00:35:32.830
"so that some portion of
this curve goes to 0.",00:35:32.830,00:35:36.690
"And indeed, if you were
to try to stir or move",00:35:36.690,00:35:39.890
"a superfluid fast
enough, there's",00:35:39.890,00:35:43.140
"a velocity at which
it breaks down,",00:35:43.140,00:35:45.240
it stops being a superfluid.,00:35:45.240,00:35:47.860
"But it turns out that that
velocity is much, much smaller",00:35:47.860,00:35:52.040
"than you would predict based on
this roton spectrum going down.",00:35:52.040,00:35:56.430
"There are some other
many body excitations",00:35:56.430,00:35:59.530
"that come before and cause
the superfluid to lose energy",00:35:59.530,00:36:04.830
and break down.,00:36:04.830,00:36:06.650
"But the genetic idea as
to why a linear spectrum",00:36:06.650,00:36:12.050
"for k close to 0 is
consist with superfluidity",00:36:12.050,00:36:16.140
"but the quadratic one
is not remains correct.",00:36:16.140,00:36:18.942
"Now suppose I am
in this situation.",00:36:25.310,00:36:31.910
"I have a moving super
fluid, such as the one",00:36:31.910,00:36:34.410
that I have described over here.,00:36:34.410,00:36:36.950
"The spectrum is going to
be somewhat like this,",00:36:36.950,00:36:40.730
but I'm not at 0 temperature.,00:36:40.730,00:36:43.450
"I want to try to describe
this T to the fourth behavior,",00:36:43.450,00:36:46.365
"so I want to be at some
finite temperature.",00:36:46.365,00:36:49.880
"So if I'm at some
finite temperature,",00:36:49.880,00:36:52.480
"there is some probability to
excite these different states,",00:36:52.480,00:36:57.070
"and the number that would
correspond to some momentum p",00:36:57.070,00:37:03.380
"would be given by this
general formula you have,",00:37:03.380,00:37:07.170
"1 over Z inverse e to the
beta epsilon of p minus 1.",00:37:07.170,00:37:14.490
"Furthermore, if I think that
I am in the regime where",00:37:14.490,00:37:22.230
"the number of excitations
is not important because",00:37:22.230,00:37:27.430
"of the same reason that I had
for Bose-Einstein condensate,",00:37:27.430,00:37:32.840
"I would have this formula
except that I would use epsilon",00:37:32.840,00:37:36.740
"of p that is appropriate
to this system.",00:37:36.740,00:37:41.540
"Actually, what is it
appropriate to this system",00:37:41.540,00:37:44.800
"is that my epsilon of
p was velocity times p.",00:37:44.800,00:37:53.160
"But then I started to move
with this superfluid velocity.",00:37:53.160,00:37:58.056
"Actually, maybe I'll
call this c so that I",00:37:58.056,00:37:59.850
"a distinction between c, which
is the linear spectrum here,",00:37:59.850,00:38:04.580
"and the superfluid
velocity dot p.",00:38:04.580,00:38:06.430
"No, this is actually
a vectorial product.",00:38:17.580,00:38:21.565
"And because of that,
I only drew one part",00:38:25.390,00:38:28.570
"of this curve that corresponds
to positive momentum.",00:38:28.570,00:38:31.920
"If I had gone to
negative momentum,",00:38:31.920,00:38:33.590
"actually, this curve
would have continued",00:38:33.590,00:38:37.460
"and whereas one branch
the energy is reduced,",00:38:37.460,00:38:41.120
"if I go to minus p,
the energy goes up.",00:38:41.120,00:38:45.600
"So whereas if the
superfluid was not moving,",00:38:45.600,00:38:50.740
"I can generate as many
excitations with momentum p",00:38:50.740,00:38:54.190
as momentum minus p.,00:38:54.190,00:38:56.510
"Once the superfluid is
moving, there is a difference.",00:38:56.510,00:39:02.450
One of them has a v dot p.,00:39:02.450,00:39:04.100
The other has minus v dot p.,00:39:04.100,00:39:06.660
"So because of that,
there is a net momentum",00:39:06.660,00:39:11.020
"that is carried by
these excitations.",00:39:11.020,00:39:14.180
"This net momentum is
obtained by summing",00:39:14.180,00:39:16.660
"over all of these
things, multiplying",00:39:16.660,00:39:19.600
with appropriate momentum.,00:39:19.600,00:39:20.850
"So I have beta is CP
minus v dot p minus 1.",00:39:20.850,00:39:31.230
"This is the momentum
of the excitation.",00:39:31.230,00:39:33.920
"This is the net momentum of
the system for one excitation.",00:39:33.920,00:39:39.080
"But then I have to sum
over all possible P's.",00:39:39.080,00:39:43.060
"Sum over P's, as
we've discussed,",00:39:43.060,00:39:45.100
I can replace with an integral.,00:39:45.100,00:39:48.550
"And sum over k be replaced with
V. Integral over K, K and P",00:39:48.550,00:39:54.960
"are simply related
by a factor of h bar.",00:39:54.960,00:39:58.540
"So whereas before for k I
had 2 pi cubed for v cubed,",00:39:58.540,00:40:02.930
I have 2 pi h bar cubed.,00:40:02.930,00:40:04.135
"So this is what I
have to calculate.",00:40:07.510,00:40:11.360
Now what happens for small v?,00:40:11.360,00:40:13.160
"I can make an expansion
in vs. The 0 order term",00:40:18.760,00:40:23.360
"in the expansion
is what we would",00:40:23.360,00:40:25.090
have for non-moving fluid.,00:40:25.090,00:40:27.490
"Momenta in the two
directions are the same,",00:40:27.490,00:40:29.550
so that contribution goes away.,00:40:29.550,00:40:32.190
"The first contribution
that I'm going to get",00:40:32.190,00:40:35.740
"is going to come from expanding
this to lowest order in P.",00:40:35.740,00:40:47.760
"So there is a P that
is sitting out front.",00:40:47.760,00:40:52.390
"When I make the
expansion, I will",00:40:52.390,00:40:54.240
"get a vs dot P
times the derivative",00:40:54.240,00:40:59.000
"of the exponential
function gives me",00:40:59.000,00:41:02.410
"a factor of beta
e to the beta CP.",00:41:02.410,00:41:08.760
"And down here I will have e to
the beta CP minus 1 squared.",00:41:08.760,00:41:15.410
"Now, in the problem set you
have to actually evaluate",00:41:22.970,00:41:25.890
this integral.,00:41:25.890,00:41:27.260
It's not that difficult.,00:41:27.260,00:41:28.660
It's related to Zeta functions.,00:41:28.660,00:41:31.020
"But what I'm really
only interested in what",00:41:31.020,00:41:33.990
is the temperature dependence?,00:41:33.990,00:41:37.170
"You can see that I can rescale
this combination, call it x.",00:41:37.170,00:41:43.660
"Essentially what it says is that
whenever I see a factor of p,",00:41:46.250,00:41:50.540
replace it by Kt over Cx.,00:41:50.540,00:41:55.590
And how many P's do I have?,00:41:55.590,00:41:57.562
"I have three, four, five.",00:41:57.562,00:42:01.715
"So I have five factors of P. So
I will have five factors of Kt.",00:42:04.610,00:42:10.740
"One of them gets
killed by the beta,",00:42:10.740,00:42:13.910
"so this whole thing
is proportional to T",00:42:13.910,00:42:16.450
to the fourth power.,00:42:16.450,00:42:17.380
So what have we found?,00:42:23.170,00:42:25.480
"We have found that as
this fluid is moving",00:42:25.480,00:42:31.820
"at some finite
temperature T, it will",00:42:31.820,00:42:35.240
generate these excitations.,00:42:35.240,00:42:38.220
"And these excitations
are preferably",00:42:38.220,00:42:41.200
"along the direction
of the momentum.",00:42:41.200,00:42:44.520
"And they correspond to
an additional momentum",00:42:44.520,00:42:49.610
"of the fluid that is
proportional to the volume.",00:42:49.610,00:42:53.460
"It's proportional to temperature
to the fourth and something.",00:42:57.210,00:43:02.400
"And of course, proportional
to the velocity.",00:43:02.400,00:43:05.990
"Now, we are used to thinking of
the proportionality of momentum",00:43:09.200,00:43:14.830
"and velocity to be
some kind of a mass.",00:43:14.830,00:43:18.050
"If I divide that
mass by the volume,",00:43:21.280,00:43:24.040
"I have a density of
these excitations.",00:43:24.040,00:43:28.710
"And what we have established
is that the density",00:43:28.710,00:43:31.480
"of those excitations
is proportional to t",00:43:31.480,00:43:35.000
to the fourth.,00:43:35.000,00:43:36.430
"And what is happening in this
Andronikashvili experiment",00:43:36.430,00:43:40.190
"is that as these plates are
moving, by this mechanism",00:43:40.190,00:43:45.170
"the superfluid
that is in contact",00:43:45.170,00:43:47.230
"with them will
create excitations.",00:43:47.230,00:43:50.740
"And the momentum of
those excitations",00:43:50.740,00:43:53.720
"would correspond to some
kind of a density that",00:43:53.720,00:43:57.130
"vanishes as T to
the fourth, again",00:43:57.130,00:44:00.540
"in agreement with
what we've seen here.",00:44:00.540,00:44:06.370
OK?,00:44:06.370,00:44:07.790
Yes?,00:44:07.790,00:44:08.420
"AUDIENCE: So in an
integral expression",00:44:08.420,00:44:10.825

"AUDIENCE: And then in the
next line [INAUDIBLE].",00:44:13.711,00:44:16.597
So it's in that direction.,00:44:16.597,00:44:18.490
"PROFESSOR: So let's give these
indices p in direction alpha.",00:44:18.490,00:44:23.530
This is p in direction alpha.,00:44:23.530,00:44:26.520
This is p in direction alpha.,00:44:26.520,00:44:29.250

"beta, sum over beta.",00:44:32.330,00:44:33.590
"Now, I have to do an
angular integration that",00:44:36.220,00:44:40.880
is spherically symmetric.,00:44:40.880,00:44:43.440
"And then somewhere inside
there it has a p alpha p beta.",00:44:43.440,00:44:48.170
"That angular
integration will give me",00:44:48.170,00:44:54.120
"a p squared over three delta
alpha beta, which then converts",00:44:54.120,00:44:59.080
"this v beta to a
b alpha, which is",00:44:59.080,00:45:02.770
"in the direction
of the momentum.",00:45:02.770,00:45:04.284
Yes?,00:45:11.280,00:45:11.780
"AUDIENCE: Will
you say once again",00:45:11.780,00:45:13.155
"what happened to the
integral dimension?",00:45:13.155,00:45:15.130
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:45:15.130,00:45:15.760
"So when we are in the
Bose-Einstein condensate,",00:45:15.760,00:45:24.020
"as far as the
excitations of concerned",00:45:24.020,00:45:28.050
we have zero chemical potential.,00:45:28.050,00:45:30.980

can be accommodated",00:45:33.090,00:45:36.560
"through the excitations we put
together in the ground state.",00:45:36.560,00:45:40.920
"So if you like the ground
state, the kp equals to 0",00:45:40.920,00:45:43.980
"or k equals to 0,
is a reservoir.",00:45:43.980,00:45:47.430
"You can add as many
particles there",00:45:47.430,00:45:49.410
"or bring as many particles
out of it as you like.",00:45:49.410,00:45:52.230
"So effectively, you have
no conservation number",00:45:52.230,00:45:55.000
and no need for a [? z. ?],00:45:55.000,00:45:56.540
"Of course, that we
only know for the case",00:46:03.350,00:46:05.880
"of the true

OK?,00:46:18.960,00:46:21.407
Any other questions?,00:46:21.407,00:46:22.240
"So this is actually
the last item",00:46:26.230,00:46:29.660
"I wanted to cover for
going on the board.",00:46:29.660,00:46:34.280
"The rest of the hour,
we have this movie",00:46:34.280,00:46:37.170

are welcome to sit and enjoy it.",00:46:49.760,00:46:53.450
It's very nice.,00:46:53.450,00:46:54.940

[VIDEO PLAYBACK],00:47:29.244,00:47:32.730
"PROFESSOR: There
will be more action.",00:48:29.314,00:48:30.855
"-We just made a transfer
from liquid helium",00:49:58.968,00:50:00.960
"out of the storage tank into
our own experimental equipment.",00:50:00.960,00:50:06.438
It is a remarkable [INAUDIBLE].,00:50:06.438,00:50:08.928
"It has two different and
easily distinguishable",00:50:08.928,00:50:11.418
"liquid phases-- a
warmer and a colder one.",00:50:11.418,00:50:15.402
"The warmer phase is called
liquid helium I and the colder",00:50:15.402,00:50:19.137
phase liquid helium II.,00:50:19.137,00:50:21.876
"The two stages are separated
by a transition temperature,",00:50:21.876,00:50:25.860
known as the lambda point.,00:50:25.860,00:50:28.570

down through the lambda point,",00:50:28.570,00:50:31.725
"a transition from helium I to
helium II is clearly visible.",00:50:31.725,00:50:36.610
"We will show it to you
later in this film.",00:50:36.610,00:50:39.830
"The two liquids behave nothing
like any other known liquid,",00:50:39.830,00:50:44.720
"although it could be said that
helium I, the warmer phase,",00:50:44.720,00:50:48.620
"approximates the behavior
of common liquids.",00:50:48.620,00:50:52.140
"But it is helium II,
the colder phase,",00:50:52.140,00:50:55.620
which is truly different.,00:50:55.620,00:50:57.690

at roughly 2.2 degrees.",00:51:12.850,00:51:17.400
"Note that this
corresponds to minus 269",00:51:17.400,00:51:21.810

"The properties of liquid
helium that I have just",00:51:26.514,00:51:29.390

exist for helium-3.",00:52:02.690,00:52:04.868
"The low temperature at
which we'll be working",00:52:08.330,00:52:10.670
"calls for well-insulated
containers.",00:52:10.670,00:52:12.980
"The dewar meets
our requirements.",00:52:12.980,00:52:15.045
"The word ""dewar"" is
a scientific name",00:52:15.045,00:52:17.620
"given to a double-walled
vessel with the space",00:52:17.620,00:52:19.758

"When these dewars
are made of glass,",00:52:22.500,00:52:24.000

inner space is usually",00:52:24.000,00:52:26.800
"filtered to cut down heat
transfer by radiation.",00:52:26.800,00:52:30.045
"However, our dewars will
have to be transparent",00:52:30.045,00:52:33.920
"so that we can look at
what's going on inside.",00:52:33.920,00:52:37.280
"Now, liquid helium is commonly
stored in double dewars.",00:52:37.280,00:52:40.420
"The design is quite
simple, just put one",00:52:40.420,00:52:44.035
inside the other like this.,00:52:44.035,00:52:49.676

put the liquid helium,",00:52:49.676,00:52:52.360

the inner and outer dewar,",00:52:52.360,00:52:54.820
"we maintain a supply
of liquid air.",00:52:54.820,00:52:57.240

with liquid helium.",00:53:07.530,00:53:10.700

contains liquid air.",00:53:10.700,00:53:12.910
"The normal boiling
temperature of liquid air",00:53:16.530,00:53:19.450
"is about 80 degrees
Kelvin, 75 or more degrees",00:53:19.450,00:53:23.740
hotter than liquid helium.,00:53:23.740,00:53:26.190
"The purpose of the
liquid air is twofold.",00:53:26.190,00:53:28.620
"First, we put the liquid air
in the outer dewar well ahead",00:53:31.710,00:53:34.450
"of putting liquid helium
in the inner dewar.",00:53:34.450,00:53:37.810
"In this way, the inner
dewar is pre-cooled.",00:53:37.810,00:53:42.003
"Secondly, we maintain
a supply of liquid air",00:53:42.003,00:53:44.861
"in the outer dewar
because it provides",00:53:44.861,00:53:47.240
"an additional
[INAUDIBLE] of insulation",00:53:47.240,00:53:49.910
"now that the liquid helium
is in the inner dewar.",00:53:49.910,00:53:53.010
"The [INAUDIBLE] liquid
air attests to the fact",00:53:53.010,00:53:55.480
"that it is absorbing
some of the heat which",00:53:55.480,00:53:57.510
enters the double dewar.,00:53:57.510,00:53:58.510
"Even with the boiling
of the liquid air,",00:54:01.410,00:54:03.850
"the liquid helium
is clearly visible.",00:54:03.850,00:54:06.690
"Later, we will use
liquid air cooled",00:54:06.690,00:54:09.140
"below its boiling temperature
to reduce or eliminate",00:54:09.140,00:54:12.228
"the air bubbles for
better visibility.",00:54:12.228,00:54:13.811
"Now the liquid
air is cooled down",00:54:17.870,00:54:20.050
and we have eliminated boiling.,00:54:20.050,00:54:22.540
"The smaller bubbles of
the boiling liquid helium",00:54:22.540,00:54:25.340
are clearly visible.,00:54:25.340,00:54:27.424
"The cover over the inner dewar
has a port, at present open.",00:54:27.424,00:54:32.210
"The liquid helium is at
atmospheric pressure,",00:54:32.210,00:54:35.750
"so its temperature is
4.2 degrees Kelvin.",00:54:35.750,00:54:39.200
"In other words, what
we have in here now",00:54:43.200,00:54:45.546
"is liquid helium one, the
warmer of the two phases.",00:54:45.546,00:54:49.800
"Before we cool it down to take
a look at the superfluid phase,",00:54:49.800,00:54:53.740
"I want to dwell greatly on the
properties of helium I. I've",00:54:53.740,00:54:57.710
"told you before
that even helium I",00:54:57.710,00:55:00.665
"is different from
the normal liquids.",00:55:00.665,00:55:04.361

atoms and this liquid",00:55:04.361,00:55:06.610
is quite large.,00:55:06.610,00:55:08.186
"The atoms are not
as closely packed",00:55:08.186,00:55:10.150
as in the classical liquids.,00:55:10.150,00:55:11.700
"The reason for this
is quantum mechanics.",00:55:11.700,00:55:14.890
"The zero point energy is
relatively more important",00:55:14.890,00:55:17.700
here than in any other liquid.,00:55:17.700,00:55:19.270
"As a consequence,
liquid helium has",00:55:21.817,00:55:23.275
"a very low mass density, only
about 13% the density of water,",00:55:23.275,00:55:29.460
and a very low optical density.,00:55:29.460,00:55:31.430
"The index of refraction
is quite close to 1.",00:55:31.430,00:55:35.455

to see with the naked eye",00:55:35.455,00:55:38.510
"under ordinary
lighting conditions.",00:55:38.510,00:55:42.160

familiar with the fact",00:55:42.160,00:55:44.434
"that the helium atom has
closed shell atomic structure.",00:55:44.434,00:55:49.150
"This explains why helium is
a chemically inert element.",00:55:49.150,00:55:52.500
"It also accounts for the fact
that the force of attraction",00:55:52.500,00:55:55.820
"between neighboring helium
atoms, the so-called van der",00:55:55.820,00:55:58.905
"Waals force, is small.",00:55:58.905,00:56:02.760
"It takes little energy to
pull two helium atoms apart,",00:56:02.760,00:56:05.580
as for example in evaporation.,00:56:05.580,00:56:10.170
"This gives liquid helium
a better small latent",00:56:10.170,00:56:12.550
heat of vaporization.,00:56:12.550,00:56:14.660
"Only five calories are
needed to evaporate one gram.",00:56:14.660,00:56:18.242

where evaporation requires",00:56:18.242,00:56:21.900
"between 500 and 600
calories per gram.",00:56:21.900,00:56:24.105
"The low van der Waals force
combined with a large zero",00:56:26.780,00:56:30.745
"point energy also accounts for
the fact that liquid helium",00:56:30.745,00:56:34.200
"does not freeze, cannot
be solidified at ordinary",00:56:34.200,00:56:38.150
"pressure, no matter
how far we cool it.",00:56:38.150,00:56:41.490

solidified at high pressure.",00:56:41.490,00:56:44.700

dewar is at 4,2 degrees.",00:56:47.450,00:56:51.465

down to the lambda point",00:56:51.465,00:56:54.720
