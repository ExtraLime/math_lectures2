right, on Friday?",00:00:45.200,00:00:50.850

show you some applications,",00:00:53.265,00:00:57.540

aren't we?,00:01:42.640,00:01:43.140
"Any questions about
this technical stuff?",00:01:47.030,00:01:49.590
"All right, let's talk about
power series for a little bit.",00:01:52.900,00:01:56.860
"So I thought I should
review for you what",00:01:56.860,00:02:00.000
the story with power series is.,00:02:00.000,00:02:01.980
"OK, could I have your
attention please?",00:02:21.595,00:02:23.220
"So, power series is a way of
writing a function as a sum",00:02:26.920,00:02:31.640
of integral powers of x.,00:02:31.640,00:02:33.560
"These a_0, a_1, and
so on, are numbers.",00:02:33.560,00:02:38.090
"An example of a power
series is a polynomial.",00:02:38.090,00:02:43.060
"Not to be forgotten,
one type of power series",00:02:48.050,00:02:51.250
"is one which goes on for
a finite number of terms",00:02:51.250,00:02:57.560
"and then ends, so that all of
the other, all the higher a_i's",00:02:57.560,00:03:02.090
are all 0.,00:03:02.090,00:03:03.650
"This is a perfectly good
example of a power series;",00:03:03.650,00:03:06.150
"it's a very special
kind of power series.",00:03:06.150,00:03:08.862
"And part of what I
want to tell you today",00:03:08.862,00:03:10.570
"is that power series
behave, almost exactly like,",00:03:10.570,00:03:14.290
polynomials.,00:03:14.290,00:03:14.970
"There's just one
thing that you have",00:03:14.970,00:03:16.490
"to be careful about when you're
using power series that isn't",00:03:16.490,00:03:20.800
"a concern for polynomials,
and I'll show you",00:03:20.800,00:03:22.810
what that is in a minute.,00:03:22.810,00:03:24.540
"So, you should think of them
as generalized polynomials.",00:03:24.540,00:03:29.320
"The one thing that you
have to be careful about",00:03:29.320,00:03:32.140
"is that there is a
number-- So one caution.",00:03:32.140,00:03:46.596
"There's a number which I'll
call R, where R can be between 0",00:03:46.596,00:03:55.490
and it can also be infinity.,00:03:55.490,00:03:57.350
"It's a number between 0
and infinity, inclusive,",00:03:57.350,00:04:00.710
"so that when the absolute
value of x is less than R.",00:04:00.710,00:04:06.830
"So when x is smaller than R
in size, the sum converges.",00:04:06.830,00:04:11.260
"This sum-- that sum
converges to a finite value.",00:04:17.220,00:04:21.170
"And when x is bigger
than R in absolute value,",00:04:21.170,00:04:25.120
the sum diverges.,00:04:25.120,00:04:26.050
"This R is called the
radius of convergence.",00:04:30.260,00:04:32.165
"So we'll see some examples of
what the radius of convergence",00:04:42.960,00:04:45.750
"is in various powers series as
well, and how you find it also.",00:04:45.750,00:04:49.625
"But, let me go on and
give you a few more",00:04:55.890,00:04:57.710
"of the properties
about power series",00:04:57.710,00:05:01.320
"which I think that professor
Jerison talked about earlier.",00:05:01.320,00:05:05.410
"So one of them is there's
a radius of convergence.",00:05:05.410,00:05:08.740
Here's another one.,00:05:08.740,00:05:10.200
"If you're inside of
the radius convergence,",00:05:15.760,00:05:18.510
"then the function has
all its derivatives,",00:05:18.510,00:05:23.460
"has all its derivatives,
just like a polynomial does.",00:05:23.460,00:05:34.530
"You can differentiate
it over and over again.",00:05:34.530,00:05:37.210
"And in terms of
those derivatives,",00:05:37.210,00:05:41.300
"the number a_n in
the power series",00:05:41.300,00:05:46.880
"can be expressed in terms of the
value of the derivative at 0.",00:05:46.880,00:05:52.000
"And this is called
Taylor's formula.",00:05:52.000,00:05:53.700
"So I'm saying that inside of
this radius of convergence,",00:05:58.540,00:06:02.390
"the function that we're
looking at, this f(x),",00:06:02.390,00:06:05.200
"can be written as the value of
the function at 0, that's a_0,",00:06:05.200,00:06:10.710
"plus the value of
the derivative.",00:06:10.710,00:06:13.830
"This bracket n means you
take the derivative n times.",00:06:13.830,00:06:17.630
"So when n is 1, you take
the derivative once at 0,",00:06:17.630,00:06:20.940
"divided by 1!, which is
!, and multiply it by x.",00:06:20.940,00:06:25.100
"That's the linear term
in the power series.",00:06:25.100,00:06:27.630
"And then the quadratic term is
you take the second derivative.",00:06:27.630,00:06:30.260
"Remember to divide
by 2!, which is 2.",00:06:30.260,00:06:33.740
"Multiply that by
x^2 and so on out.",00:06:33.740,00:06:39.730
"So, in terms-- So
the coefficients",00:06:39.730,00:06:41.870
"in the power series just record
the values of the derivatives",00:06:41.870,00:06:45.800
of the function at x = 0.,00:06:45.800,00:06:48.080
"They can be computed
that way also.",00:06:48.080,00:06:52.270
Let's see.,00:06:52.270,00:06:53.160
"I think that's the end
of my summary of things",00:06:53.160,00:06:55.760
that he talked about.,00:06:55.760,00:06:57.070
"I think he did one
example, and I'll repeat",00:06:57.070,00:06:59.110
that example of a power series.,00:06:59.110,00:07:04.680
"This example wasn't
due to David Jerison;",00:07:04.680,00:07:06.610
it was due to Leonard Euler.,00:07:06.610,00:07:07.860
"It's the example of where the
function is the exponential",00:07:11.590,00:07:15.490
function e^x.,00:07:15.490,00:07:16.210
"So, let's see.",00:07:19.280,00:07:22.695
"Let's compute what-- I will just
repeat for you the computation",00:07:22.695,00:07:25.320
"of the power series for
e^x, just because it's such",00:07:25.320,00:07:28.050
an important thing to do.,00:07:28.050,00:07:30.142
"So, in order to do that, I have
to know what the derivative",00:07:30.142,00:07:32.600
"of e^x is, and what the
second derivative of e^x is,",00:07:32.600,00:07:36.750
"and so on, because that
comes into the Taylor formula",00:07:36.750,00:07:41.250
for the coefficients.,00:07:41.250,00:07:42.690
"But we know what the derivative
of e^x is, it's just e^x again,",00:07:42.690,00:07:46.720
"and it's that way
all the way down.",00:07:46.720,00:07:49.310
"All the derivatives are
e^x over and over again.",00:07:49.310,00:07:53.310
"So when I evaluate this at x =
0, well, the value of e^x is 1,",00:07:53.310,00:07:58.505
the value of e^x is 1 at x = 0.,00:07:58.505,00:08:01.910
"You get a value of
1 all the way down.",00:08:01.910,00:08:05.180
"So all these derivatives
at 0 have the value 1.",00:08:05.180,00:08:10.090
"And now, when I plug
into this formula,",00:08:10.090,00:08:12.790
"I find e^x is 1 plus 1*x
plus 1/2! x^2 plus 1/3! x^3,",00:08:12.790,00:08:28.645
plus and so on.,00:08:28.645,00:08:32.250
"So all of these
numbers are 1, and all",00:08:32.250,00:08:34.660
"you wind up with is the
factorials in the denominators.",00:08:34.660,00:08:37.130
That's the power series for e^x.,00:08:37.130,00:08:38.870
"This was a discovery of Leonhard
Euler in 1740 or something.",00:08:38.870,00:08:42.050
"Yes, Ma'am.",00:08:42.050,00:08:42.842
"AUDIENCE: When you're
writing out the power series,",00:08:42.842,00:08:45.102
"how far do you have
to write it out?",00:08:45.102,00:08:46.910
"PROFESSOR: How far do you
have to write the power series",00:08:46.910,00:08:49.243

"Before it's a satisfactory
solution to an exam problem,",00:08:51.100,00:08:54.340
"I suppose, is another way
to phrase the question.",00:08:54.340,00:08:58.100
"Until you can see
what the pattern is.",00:08:58.100,00:09:00.920
I can see what the pattern is.,00:09:00.920,00:09:02.230
"Is there anyone who's
in doubt about what",00:09:02.230,00:09:03.938
the next term might be?,00:09:03.938,00:09:07.662
"Some people would
tell you that you",00:09:07.662,00:09:09.120
"have to write the
summation convention thing.",00:09:09.120,00:09:11.900
Don't believe them.,00:09:11.900,00:09:13.862
"If you right out enough
terms to make it clear,",00:09:13.862,00:09:15.820
that's good enough.,00:09:15.820,00:09:17.020
OK?,00:09:17.020,00:09:18.987
Is that an answer for you?,00:09:18.987,00:09:20.070
"AUDIENCE: Yes, Thank you.",00:09:20.070,00:09:22.990
"PROFESSOR: OK, so
that's a basic example.",00:09:22.990,00:09:25.980
"Let's do another basic
example of a power series.",00:09:25.980,00:09:28.960
"Oh yes, and by the way, whenever
you write out a power series,",00:09:28.960,00:09:32.240
"you should say what the
radius of convergence is.",00:09:32.240,00:09:35.240
"And for now, I will
just to tell you",00:09:35.240,00:09:37.110
"that the radius of convergence
of this power series",00:09:37.110,00:09:39.440
"is infinity; that
is, this sum always",00:09:39.440,00:09:42.870
converges for any value of x.,00:09:42.870,00:09:45.765
"I'll say a little more
about that in a few minutes.",00:09:45.765,00:09:47.890
Yeah?,00:09:47.890,00:09:49.780
"AUDIENCE: So which functions
can be written as power series?",00:09:49.780,00:09:52.880
"PROFESSOR: Which functions can
be written as power series?",00:09:52.880,00:09:57.060
That's an excellent question.,00:09:57.060,00:10:00.030
"Any function that has
a reasonable expression",00:10:00.030,00:10:05.930
"can be written as
a power series.",00:10:05.930,00:10:08.679
"I'm not giving you a very good
answer because the true answer",00:10:08.679,00:10:11.220
is a little bit complicated.,00:10:11.220,00:10:12.730
"But any of the
functions that occur",00:10:12.730,00:10:14.470
"in calculus like sines,
cosines, tangents, they all have",00:10:14.470,00:10:18.420
"power series expansions, OK?",00:10:18.420,00:10:21.495
We'll see more examples.,00:10:21.495,00:10:22.495
Let's do another example.,00:10:25.830,00:10:27.070
Here's another example.,00:10:27.070,00:10:30.130
I guess this was example one.,00:10:30.130,00:10:31.520
"So, this example, I think,
was due to Newton, not Euler.",00:10:35.520,00:10:42.140
"Let's find the power series
expansion of this function:",00:10:42.140,00:10:46.730
1/(1+x).,00:10:46.730,00:10:48.200
"Well, I think that
somewhere along the line,",00:10:48.200,00:10:51.740
"you learned about the geometric
series which tells you",00:10:51.740,00:10:56.137
"that-- which tells you
what the answer to this is,",00:10:56.137,00:10:58.220
and I'll just write it out.,00:10:58.220,00:11:00.190
"The geometric series tells
you that this function",00:11:00.190,00:11:12.240
"can be written as an
alternating sum of powers of x.",00:11:12.240,00:11:16.460
"You may wonder where
these minuses came from.",00:11:16.460,00:11:18.810
"Well, if you really think
about the geometric series,",00:11:18.810,00:11:21.100
"as you probably remembered,
there was a minus sign here,",00:11:21.100,00:11:24.430
"and that gets replaced
by these minus signs.",00:11:24.430,00:11:28.420
"I think maybe Jerison
talked about this also.",00:11:28.420,00:11:31.810
"Anyway, here's
another basic example.",00:11:31.810,00:11:34.640
"Remember what the
graph of this function",00:11:34.640,00:11:36.460
looks like when x = -1.,00:11:36.460,00:11:41.404
"Then there's a
little problem here",00:11:41.404,00:11:42.820
"because the
denominator becomes 0,",00:11:42.820,00:11:45.080
so the graph has a pole there.,00:11:45.080,00:11:47.600
"It goes up to
infinity at x = -1,",00:11:47.600,00:11:52.110
"and that's an indication that
the radius of convergence",00:11:52.110,00:11:57.620
is not infinity.,00:11:57.620,00:11:58.990
"Because if you try to converge
to this infinite number",00:11:58.990,00:12:01.240
"by putting in x = -1, here,
you'll have a big problem.",00:12:01.240,00:12:04.930
"In fact, you see when
you put in x = -1,",00:12:04.930,00:12:07.122
"you keep getting
1 in every term,",00:12:07.122,00:12:08.497
"and it gets bigger and
bigger and does not converge.",00:12:08.497,00:12:11.390
"In this example, the
radius of convergence is 1.",00:12:11.390,00:12:14.940
"OK, so, let's do
a new example now.",00:12:18.570,00:12:22.210
"Oh, and by the way,
I should say you",00:12:22.210,00:12:24.250
"can calculate these numbers
using Taylor's formula.",00:12:24.250,00:12:27.770
"If you haven't seen
it, check it out.",00:12:27.770,00:12:29.940
"Calculate the iterated
derivatives of this function",00:12:29.940,00:12:36.580
"and plug in x = 0 and see
that you get +1, -1, +1, -1,",00:12:36.580,00:12:41.410
and so on.,00:12:41.410,00:12:41.930
Yes sir.,00:12:41.930,00:12:42.706
"AUDIENCE: For the
radius of convergence",00:12:42.706,00:12:44.636
"I see that if you do
-1 it'll blow out.",00:12:44.636,00:12:48.090
"If you put in 1 though, it
seems like it would be fine.",00:12:48.090,00:12:50.740
"PROFESSOR: The
questions is I can",00:12:50.740,00:12:52.550
"see that there's a
problem at x = -1,",00:12:52.550,00:12:54.870
"why is there also
a problem at x = 1",00:12:54.870,00:12:57.280
"where the graph is
perfectly smooth",00:12:57.280,00:12:59.090
and innocuous and finite.,00:12:59.090,00:13:00.760
"That's another
excellent question.",00:13:00.760,00:13:04.490
"The problem is that if you
go off to a radius of 1",00:13:04.490,00:13:07.650
"in any direction and there's
a problem, that's it.",00:13:07.650,00:13:11.530
"That's what the radius
of convergence is.",00:13:11.530,00:13:13.530
"Here, what does happen
if I put an x = +1?",00:13:13.530,00:13:18.070
"So, let's look at
the partial sums.",00:13:18.070,00:13:20.490
Do x = +1 in your mind here.,00:13:20.490,00:13:23.060
"So I'll get a partial sum 1,
then 0, and then 1, and then 0,",00:13:23.060,00:13:29.190
and then 1.,00:13:29.190,00:13:29.907
"So even though it doesn't
go up to infinity,",00:13:29.907,00:13:31.740
it still does not converge.,00:13:31.740,00:13:32.900
"AUDIENCE: And
anything in between?",00:13:32.900,00:13:35.500
"PROFESSOR: Any of
these other things",00:13:35.500,00:13:37.510
"will also fail to
converge in this example.",00:13:37.510,00:13:41.330
"Well, that's the only two
real numbers at the edge.",00:13:41.330,00:13:43.685
Right?,00:13:43.685,00:13:44.185
"OK, let's do a
different example now.",00:13:46.940,00:13:49.050
How about a trig function?,00:13:49.050,00:13:50.210
The sine of x.,00:13:50.210,00:13:50.793
"I'm going to compute the power
series expansion for sin(x).",00:13:55.422,00:14:01.810
"and I'm going to do it
using Taylor's formula.",00:14:01.810,00:14:04.400
"So Taylor's formula
says that I have",00:14:04.400,00:14:06.310
"to start computing
derivatives of sin(x).",00:14:06.310,00:14:09.452
"Sounds like it's going
to be a lot of work.",00:14:22.100,00:14:25.280
"Let's see, the derivative
of the sine is the cosine.",00:14:25.280,00:14:28.005
"And the derivative
of the cosine,",00:14:30.870,00:14:32.910
"that's the second derivative
of the sine, is what?",00:14:32.910,00:14:36.530
"Remember the minus,
it's -sin(x).",00:14:36.530,00:14:40.270
"OK, now I want to take the third
derivative of the sine, which",00:14:40.270,00:14:43.180
"is the derivative
of sine prime prime,",00:14:43.180,00:14:45.680
so it's the derivative of this.,00:14:45.680,00:14:47.760
"And we just decided
the derivative of sine",00:14:47.760,00:14:49.840
"is cosine, so I
get cosine, but I",00:14:49.840,00:14:52.270
have this minus sign in front.,00:14:52.270,00:14:53.730
"And now I want to
differentiate again,",00:14:56.660,00:14:58.710
"so the cosine
becomes a minus sine,",00:14:58.710,00:15:01.640
"and that sign cancels with this
minus sign to give me sin(x).",00:15:01.640,00:15:08.520
You follow that?,00:15:08.520,00:15:10.102
"It's a lot of -1's
canceling out there.",00:15:10.102,00:15:13.660
"So, all of a sudden, I'm
right back where I started;",00:15:13.660,00:15:17.290
"these two are the same and the
pattern will now repeat forever",00:15:17.290,00:15:21.610
and ever.,00:15:21.610,00:15:22.780
"Higher and higher
derivatives of sines",00:15:22.780,00:15:24.440
"are just plus or minus
sines and cosines.",00:15:24.440,00:15:28.830
"Now Taylor's formula says I
should now substitute x = 0",00:15:28.830,00:15:34.300
"into this and see what
happens, so let's do that.",00:15:34.300,00:15:37.580
"When x is equals to 0, the
sine is 0 and the cosine is 1.",00:15:37.580,00:15:43.240
"The sine is 0, so
minus 0 is also 0.",00:15:43.240,00:15:47.410
"The cosine is 1, but
now there's a minus one,",00:15:47.410,00:15:51.070
"and now I'm back
where I started,",00:15:51.070,00:15:53.720
and so the pattern will repeat.,00:15:53.720,00:15:58.760
"OK, so the values
of the derivatives",00:15:58.760,00:16:00.670
"are all zeros and
plus and minus ones",00:16:00.670,00:16:03.630
"and they go through that
pattern, four-fold periodicity,",00:16:03.630,00:16:07.420
over and over again.,00:16:07.420,00:16:09.670
"And so we can write
out what sin(x)",00:16:09.670,00:16:13.277
"is using Taylor's formula,
using this formula.",00:16:13.277,00:16:15.410
"So I put in the value
at 0 which is 0, then",00:16:18.000,00:16:21.770
"I put in the derivative
which is 1, multiplied by x.",00:16:21.770,00:16:27.620
"Then, I have the second
derivative divided by 2!,",00:16:27.620,00:16:32.180
"but the second
derivative at 0 is 0.",00:16:32.180,00:16:35.150
"So I'm going to
drop that term out.",00:16:35.150,00:16:38.280
"Now I have the third
derivative which is -1.",00:16:38.280,00:16:41.365
And remember the 3!,00:16:43.930,00:16:45.550
in the denominator.,00:16:45.550,00:16:46.790
That's the coefficient of x^3.,00:16:46.790,00:16:50.050
What's the fourth derivative?,00:16:50.050,00:16:51.680
"Well, here we are, it's
on the board, it's 0.",00:16:51.680,00:16:54.400
"So I drop that term out
go up to the fifth term,",00:16:54.400,00:16:58.150
the fifth power of x.,00:16:58.150,00:16:59.830
Its derivative is now 1.,00:16:59.830,00:17:02.260
"We've gone through the pattern,
we're back at +1 as the value",00:17:02.260,00:17:06.750
"of the iterated derivative,
so now I get 1/5! x^5.",00:17:06.750,00:17:13.180
"Now, you tell me, have we
done enough terms to see",00:17:13.180,00:17:15.720
what the pattern is?,00:17:15.720,00:17:17.900
"I guess the next
term will be a -1/7!",00:17:17.900,00:17:22.170
"x^7, and so on.",00:17:22.170,00:17:23.750
"Let me write this out
again just so we have it.",00:17:23.750,00:17:28.160
"x^3 / 3!-- So it's
x minus x^3 / 3!",00:17:28.160,00:17:30.830
plus x^5 / 5!.,00:17:30.830,00:17:31.680
"You guessed it, and so on.",00:17:34.580,00:17:38.740
"That's the power
series expansion",00:17:38.740,00:17:40.270
"for the sine of x, OK?",00:17:40.270,00:17:43.935
"And so, the sign alternate,
and these denominators",00:17:46.950,00:17:49.700
"get very big, don't they?",00:17:49.700,00:17:52.250
Exponentials grow very fast.,00:17:52.250,00:17:54.410
Let me make a remark.,00:17:54.410,00:17:55.830
R is infinity here.,00:17:55.830,00:17:58.800
"The radius of convergence
of this power series",00:17:58.800,00:18:01.580
"again is infinity, and
let me just say why.",00:18:01.580,00:18:03.424
"The reason is that the general
term is going to be like",00:18:03.424,00:18:13.110
x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)!.,00:18:13.110,00:18:14.100
"An odd number I can
write as 2n + 1.",00:18:18.330,00:18:21.900
"And what I want to
say is that the size",00:18:21.900,00:18:24.608
"of this, what happens
to the size of this as n",00:18:24.608,00:18:30.480
goes to infinity?,00:18:30.480,00:18:33.989
So let's just think about this.,00:18:33.989,00:18:35.280
"For a fixed x, let's
fix the number x.",00:18:35.280,00:18:38.270
"Look at powers of x and
think about the size",00:18:38.270,00:18:41.260
"of this expression when
n gets to be large.",00:18:41.260,00:18:45.682
"So let's just do
that for a second.",00:18:45.682,00:18:47.140
"So, x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)!, I
can write out like this.",00:18:47.140,00:18:54.420
"It's x / 1 times x / 2
-- sorry -- times x / 3,",00:18:54.420,00:19:03.010
times x / (2n+1).,00:19:03.010,00:19:09.250
"I've multiplied x by itself
2n+1 times in the numerator,",00:19:09.250,00:19:13.220
"and I've multiplied
the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,",00:19:13.220,00:19:15.680
"and so on, by each other
in the denominator,",00:19:15.680,00:19:18.477
and that gives me the factorial.,00:19:18.477,00:19:19.810
"So I've just written
this out like this.",00:19:19.810,00:19:22.330
"Now x is fixed, so maybe
it's a million, OK?",00:19:22.330,00:19:26.820
"It's big, but fixed.",00:19:26.820,00:19:28.700
What happens to these numbers?,00:19:28.700,00:19:30.634
"Well at first,
they're pretty big.",00:19:30.634,00:19:32.050
"This is 1,000,000 / 2,
this is 1,000,000 / 3.",00:19:32.050,00:19:34.560
"But when n gets to be--
Maybe if n is 1,000,000,",00:19:34.560,00:19:38.820
then this is about 1/2.,00:19:38.820,00:19:41.180
"If n is a billion, then this
is about 1/2,000, right?",00:19:41.180,00:19:48.320
"The denominators keep
getting bigger and bigger,",00:19:48.320,00:19:50.530
"but the numerators stay
the same; they're always x.",00:19:50.530,00:19:54.470
"So when I take the product,
if I go far enough out,",00:19:54.470,00:19:57.590
"I'm going to be multiplying,
by very, very small numbers",00:19:57.590,00:20:00.070
and more and more of them.,00:20:00.070,00:20:01.730
"And so no matter what
x is, these numbers",00:20:01.730,00:20:05.980
will converge to 0.,00:20:05.980,00:20:07.220
"They'll get smaller and
smaller as x gets to be bigger.",00:20:07.220,00:20:11.550
"That's the sign that x is inside
of the radius of convergence.",00:20:11.550,00:20:16.590
"This is the sign for
you that this series",00:20:16.590,00:20:21.360
converges for that value of x.,00:20:21.360,00:20:23.780
"And because I could do
this for any x, this works.",00:20:23.780,00:20:33.600
"This convergence to
0 for any fixed x.",00:20:33.600,00:20:40.260
"That's what tells
you that you can",00:20:40.260,00:20:43.330
"take-- that the radius of
convergence is infinity.",00:20:43.330,00:20:46.060
"Because in the
formula, in the fact,",00:20:46.060,00:20:49.575
"in this property that
the radius of convergence",00:20:49.575,00:20:53.700
"talks about, if R is
equal to infinity,",00:20:53.700,00:20:56.340
this is no condition on x.,00:20:56.340,00:20:58.160
"Every number is less than
infinity in absolute value.",00:20:58.160,00:21:02.250
"So if this convergence
to 0 of the general term",00:21:02.250,00:21:05.930
"works for every x, then radius
of convergence is infinity.",00:21:05.930,00:21:10.320
"Well that was kind
of fast, but I",00:21:10.320,00:21:11.700
"think that you've heard
something about that",00:21:11.700,00:21:13.790
earlier as well.,00:21:13.790,00:21:16.020
"Anyway, so we've got the
sine function, a new function",00:21:16.020,00:21:19.140
with its own power series.,00:21:19.140,00:21:20.880
It's a way of computing sin(x).,00:21:20.880,00:21:23.730
"If you take enough
terms you'll get",00:21:23.730,00:21:26.660
a good evaluation of sin(x).,00:21:26.660,00:21:28.560
for any x.,00:21:28.560,00:21:30.000
"This tells you a lot
about the function sin(x)",00:21:30.000,00:21:32.200
but not everything at all.,00:21:32.200,00:21:33.750
"For example, from
this formula, it's",00:21:33.750,00:21:36.590
"very hard to see that the
sine of x is periodic.",00:21:36.590,00:21:39.745
It's not obvious at all.,00:21:39.745,00:21:41.930
"Somewhere hidden away
in this expression",00:21:41.930,00:21:44.090
"is the number pi, the
half of the period.",00:21:44.090,00:21:47.400
"But that's not clear from
the power series at all.",00:21:47.400,00:21:51.100
"So the power series are
very good for some things,",00:21:51.100,00:21:53.320
"but they hide other
properties of functions.",00:21:53.320,00:21:55.510
"Well, so I want to spend
a few minutes telling you",00:21:58.150,00:22:00.830
"about what you can do
with a power series,",00:22:00.830,00:22:04.350
"once you have one, to get new
power series, so new power",00:22:04.350,00:22:07.620
series from old.,00:22:07.620,00:22:08.530
"And this is also called
operations on power series.",00:22:18.300,00:22:25.490
"So what are the things that
we can do to a power series?",00:22:25.490,00:22:27.989
"Well one of the things
you can do is multiply.",00:22:27.989,00:22:29.905
"So, for example, what if
I want to compute a power",00:22:33.990,00:22:37.310
series for x sin(x)?,00:22:37.310,00:22:40.970
"Well I have a power series
for sin(x), I just did it.",00:22:40.970,00:22:44.160
How about a power series for x?,00:22:44.160,00:22:45.920
"Actually, I did that here too.",00:22:48.910,00:22:51.480
"The function x is a
very simple polynomial.",00:22:51.480,00:22:55.120
"It's a polynomial where
that's 0, a_1 is 1,",00:22:55.120,00:22:58.330
"and all the other
coefficients are 0.",00:22:58.330,00:23:00.930
"So x itself is a power
series, a very simple one.",00:23:00.930,00:23:04.870
sin(x) is a powers series.,00:23:04.870,00:23:08.317
"And what I want to
encourage you to do",00:23:08.317,00:23:09.900
"is treat power series
just like polynomials",00:23:09.900,00:23:12.720
and multiply them together.,00:23:12.720,00:23:14.330
We'll see other operations too.,00:23:14.330,00:23:16.960
"So, to compute the power series
for x sin(x), of I just take",00:23:16.960,00:23:20.860
this one and multiply it by x.,00:23:20.860,00:23:24.400
"So let's see if I
can do that right.",00:23:24.400,00:23:26.650
"It distributes through:
x^2 minus x^4 / 3!",00:23:26.650,00:23:30.050
"plus x^6 / 5!, and so on.",00:23:33.000,00:23:42.190
"And again, the
radius of convergence",00:23:42.190,00:23:44.180
"is going to be the smaller of
the two radii of convergence",00:23:44.180,00:23:47.130
here.,00:23:47.130,00:23:48.220
"So it's R equals
infinity in this case.",00:23:48.220,00:23:51.840
"OK, you can multiply
power series together.",00:23:51.840,00:23:54.010
"It can be a pain if the
power series are very long,",00:23:54.010,00:23:56.910
"but if one of them is
x, it's pretty simple.",00:23:56.910,00:24:01.800
"OK, that's one thing I can do.",00:24:01.800,00:24:06.040
Notice something by the way.,00:24:06.040,00:24:08.634
"You know that even
and odd functions?",00:24:08.634,00:24:10.175
"So, sine is an odd function,
x is an odd function,",00:24:13.180,00:24:17.390
"the product of two odd
functions is an even function.",00:24:17.390,00:24:20.570
"And that's reflected in the fact
that all the powers that occur",00:24:20.570,00:24:24.070
in the power series are even.,00:24:24.070,00:24:26.790
"For an odd function, like the
sine, all the powers that occur",00:24:26.790,00:24:30.640
are odd powers of x.,00:24:30.640,00:24:32.589
That's always true.,00:24:32.589,00:24:33.380
"OK, we can multiply.",00:24:37.510,00:24:38.969
I can also differentiate.,00:24:38.969,00:24:40.010
"So let's just do a
case of that, and use",00:24:48.660,00:24:56.950
"the process of
differentiation to find out",00:24:56.950,00:24:59.240
"what the power
series for cos(x) is",00:24:59.240,00:25:03.580
"by writing the cos(x) as
the derivative of the sine",00:25:03.580,00:25:06.560
"and differentiating
term by term.",00:25:06.560,00:25:09.010
"So, I'll take this
expression for the power",00:25:09.010,00:25:11.360
"series of the sine and
differentiate it term by term,",00:25:11.360,00:25:14.200
"and I'll get the power
series for cosine.",00:25:14.200,00:25:18.210
"So, let's see.",00:25:18.210,00:25:19.030
The derivative of x is one.,00:25:19.030,00:25:22.510
"Now, the derivative of x^3 is
3x^2, and then there's a 3!",00:25:22.510,00:25:27.110
in the denominator.,00:25:27.110,00:25:28.910
"And the derivative of x^5
5x^4, and there's a 5!",00:25:28.910,00:25:34.440
"in the denominator,
and so on and so on.",00:25:34.440,00:25:38.680
"And now some
cancellation happens.",00:25:38.680,00:25:40.950
"So this is 1 minus, well, the
3 cancels with the last factor",00:25:40.950,00:25:45.960
"in this 3 factorial
and leaves you with 2!.",00:25:45.960,00:25:48.730
"And the 5 cancels with the
last factor in the 5 factorial",00:25:52.460,00:25:56.040
and leaves you with a 4!,00:25:56.040,00:25:58.129
in the denominator.,00:25:58.129,00:25:58.920
"And so there you go, there's
the power series expansion",00:26:01.570,00:26:04.710
for the cosine.,00:26:04.710,00:26:05.980
It's got all even powers of x.,00:26:05.980,00:26:07.970
"They alternate, and you have
factorials in the denominator.",00:26:07.970,00:26:12.720
"And of course, you could
derive that expression",00:26:12.720,00:26:15.510
"by using Taylor's formula, by
the same kind of calculation",00:26:15.510,00:26:19.130
"you did here, taking higher
and higher derivatives",00:26:19.130,00:26:22.290
of the cosine.,00:26:22.290,00:26:22.970
"You get the same
periodic pattern",00:26:22.970,00:26:25.720
"of derivatives and values
of derivatives at x = 0.",00:26:25.720,00:26:30.080
"But here's a cleaner way to
do it, simpler way to do it,",00:26:30.080,00:26:33.200
"because we already knew
the derivative of the sine.",00:26:33.200,00:26:36.830
"When you differentiate, you keep
the same radius of convergence.",00:26:36.830,00:26:39.630
"OK, so we can
multiply, I can add too",00:26:44.420,00:26:49.320
"and multiply by a
constant, things like that.",00:26:49.320,00:26:52.400
How about integrating?,00:26:52.400,00:26:54.280
"That's what half of this
course was about isn't it?",00:26:54.280,00:26:56.580
"So, let's integrate something.",00:26:56.580,00:26:58.550
"So, the integration I'm
going to do is this one:",00:27:07.210,00:27:15.960
"the integral from 0
to x of dt / (1+x).",00:27:15.960,00:27:20.160
"What is that integral
as a function?",00:27:20.160,00:27:21.980
"So, when I find the
anti-derivative of this,",00:27:28.360,00:27:32.060
"I get ln(1+t), and then when
I evaluate that at t = x,",00:27:32.060,00:27:39.660
I get ln(1+x).,00:27:39.660,00:27:42.600
"And when I evaluate the natural
log at 0, I get the ln 1,",00:27:42.600,00:27:48.510
"which is 0, so this
is what you get, OK?",00:27:48.510,00:27:55.070
"This is really valid, by the
way, for x bigger than -1.",00:27:55.070,00:28:05.690
"But you don't want to think
about this quite like this",00:28:05.690,00:28:09.060
when x is smaller than that.,00:28:09.060,00:28:10.240
"Now, I'm going to try to apply
power series methods here",00:28:13.770,00:28:18.900
"and find-- use this integral
to find a power series",00:28:18.900,00:28:22.660
"for the natural log, and I'll
do it by plugging into this",00:28:22.660,00:28:28.230
"expression what the power
series for 1/(1+t) was.",00:28:28.230,00:28:34.330
"And I know what that is because
I wrote it down on the board",00:28:34.330,00:28:36.830
up here.,00:28:36.830,00:28:38.330
"Change the variable
from x to t there,",00:28:38.330,00:28:40.940
"and so 1/(1+t) is 1 minus t
plus t^2 minus t^3, and so on.",00:28:40.940,00:28:49.410
"So that's the thing in the
inside of the integral,",00:28:52.620,00:28:55.196
"and now it's legal to
integrate that term by term,",00:28:55.196,00:29:01.710
so let's do that.,00:29:01.710,00:29:03.517
"I'm going to get something
which I will then",00:29:03.517,00:29:05.350
evaluate at x and at 0.,00:29:05.350,00:29:09.230
"So, when I integrate 1 I get
x, and when I integrate t,",00:29:09.230,00:29:14.093
I get t.,00:29:14.093,00:29:14.593
I'm sorry.,00:29:14.593,00:29:16.829
"When I integrate t, I get t^2
/ 2, and t^2 gives me t^3 / 3,",00:29:16.829,00:29:29.100
and so on and so on.,00:29:29.100,00:29:29.970
"And then, when I
put in t = x, well,",00:29:32.520,00:29:36.350
"I just replace all the t's by
x's, and when I put in t = 0,",00:29:36.350,00:29:40.350
I get 0.,00:29:40.350,00:29:41.780
So this equals x.,00:29:41.780,00:29:43.950
"So, I've discovered that ln(1+x)
is x minus x^2 / 2 plus x^3 / 3",00:29:43.950,00:29:55.170
"minus x^4 / 4, and
so on and so on.",00:29:55.170,00:30:02.020
"There's the power series
expansion for ln(1+x).",00:30:02.020,00:30:04.720
"And because I began
with a power series",00:30:07.800,00:30:10.280
"whose radius of
convergence was just 1,",00:30:10.280,00:30:13.030
"I began with this power
series, the radius",00:30:13.030,00:30:15.930
"of convergence of this
is also going to be 1.",00:30:15.930,00:30:18.150
"Also, because this function,
as I just pointed out,",00:30:22.200,00:30:25.670
"this function goes bad when
x becomes less than -1,",00:30:25.670,00:30:29.080
"so some problem happens,
and that's reflected",00:30:29.080,00:30:32.160
in the radius of convergence.,00:30:32.160,00:30:35.590
Cool.,00:30:35.590,00:30:36.750
"So, you can integrate.",00:30:36.750,00:30:41.110
"That is the correct power series
expansion for the ln(1+x),",00:30:41.110,00:30:45.570
"and another victory of Euler's
was to use this kind of power",00:30:45.570,00:30:49.340
"series expansion to calculate
natural logarithms in a much",00:30:49.340,00:30:52.270
"more efficient way than
people had done before.",00:30:52.270,00:30:54.350
"OK, one more property, I think.",00:30:57.850,00:31:08.380
"What are we at here, 3?",00:31:12.920,00:31:17.080
4.,00:31:17.080,00:31:18.550
Substitute.,00:31:18.550,00:31:19.050
"Very appropriate for me
as a substitute teacher",00:31:25.410,00:31:28.669
to tell you about substitution.,00:31:28.669,00:31:29.960
"So I'm going to try to find
the power series expansion",00:31:32.810,00:31:35.480
of e^(-t^2).,00:31:35.480,00:31:36.385
OK?,00:31:36.385,00:31:36.885
"And the way I'll do that is
by taking the power series",00:31:41.740,00:31:45.190
"expansion for e^x,
which we have up there,",00:31:45.190,00:31:50.050
"and make the substitution x =
-t^2 in the expansion for e^x.",00:31:50.050,00:32:01.630
Did you have a question?,00:32:01.630,00:32:03.125
"AUDIENCE: Well,
it's just concerning",00:32:03.125,00:32:04.625
the radius of convergence.,00:32:04.625,00:32:07.624
"You can't define x so that is
always positive, and if so,",00:32:07.624,00:32:11.660
"it wouldn't have a radius
of convergence, right?",00:32:11.660,00:32:14.360
"PROFESSOR: Like I say, again the
worry is this ln(1+x) function",00:32:14.360,00:32:20.740
"is perfectly well
behaved for large x.",00:32:20.740,00:32:24.120
"Why does the power series
fail to converge for large x?",00:32:24.120,00:32:27.720
"Well suppose that
x is bigger than 1,",00:32:27.720,00:32:30.260
"then here you get
bigger and bigger powers",00:32:30.260,00:32:32.200
"of x, which will
grow to infinity,",00:32:32.200,00:32:35.160
"and they grow large faster
than the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.",00:32:35.160,00:32:40.330
"They grow exponentially, and
these just grow linearly.",00:32:40.330,00:32:45.850
"So, again, the general term,
when x is bigger than one,",00:32:45.850,00:32:49.430
"the general term will
go off to infinity,",00:32:49.430,00:32:51.600
"even though the function
that you're talking about,",00:32:51.600,00:32:53.840
"log of net of 1 plus
x is perfectly good.",00:32:53.840,00:32:56.750
"So the power series is not
good outside of the radius",00:32:56.750,00:33:01.615
of convergence.,00:33:01.615,00:33:02.240
It's just a fact of life.,00:33:02.240,00:33:04.650
Yes?,00:33:04.650,00:33:05.150

it the smaller of the two",00:33:20.290,00:33:22.620

"The basic answer
is, well, you can't",00:33:24.110,00:33:30.050
"expect it to be bigger than that
smaller one, because the power",00:33:30.050,00:33:33.370

case, both of the radii",00:33:41.010,00:33:43.390

this, and then I'm",00:33:54.850,00:33:58.162

this and that'll",00:33:58.162,00:33:59.620
"be the end of what I
have time for today.",00:33:59.620,00:34:03.830

"The power series
expansion of this",00:34:05.880,00:34:07.490
"is going to be a
function of t, right,",00:34:07.490,00:34:11.160
because the variable here is t.,00:34:11.160,00:34:13.530

for e^x and putting in what x",00:34:13.530,00:34:19.360
is in terms of t.,00:34:19.360,00:34:20.460
Whoops!,00:34:30.210,00:34:32.180
And so on and so on.,00:34:32.180,00:34:36.700

x there in the series expansion",00:34:36.700,00:34:42.100
for e^x.,00:34:42.100,00:34:44.120
"I can work this out
a little bit better.",00:34:44.120,00:34:47.910
-t^2 is what it is.,00:34:47.910,00:34:49.030
"This is going to give me a t^4
and the minus squared is going",00:34:49.030,00:34:53.760
"to give me a plus,
so I get t^4 / 2!.",00:34:53.760,00:34:55.790
"Then I get (-t)^3, so there'll
be a minus sign and a t^6",00:34:58.730,00:35:05.750
and the denominator 3!.,00:35:05.750,00:35:08.190

going to alternate,",00:35:08.190,00:35:10.300
"the powers are all even,
and the denominators",00:35:10.300,00:35:13.430
are these factorials.,00:35:13.430,00:35:15.380
"Several times as this
course has gone on,",00:35:20.160,00:35:23.950
"the error function has
made an appearance.",00:35:23.950,00:35:27.216
"The error function was, I guess
it gets normalized by putting",00:35:27.216,00:35:31.790
"a 2 over the square
root of pi in front,",00:35:31.790,00:35:41.550
"and it's the integral of
e^(-t^2) dt from 0 to x.",00:35:41.550,00:35:46.830
"And this normalization
is here because as x",00:35:46.830,00:35:54.700
"gets to be large
the value becomes 1.",00:35:54.700,00:36:01.300
"So this error function is
very important in the theory",00:36:01.300,00:36:04.305
of probability.,00:36:04.305,00:36:06.080
"And I think you calculated
this fact at some point",00:36:06.080,00:36:09.120
in the course.,00:36:09.120,00:36:12.236
"So the standard definition of
the error function, you put a 2",00:36:12.236,00:36:14.960
"over the square
root of pi in front.",00:36:14.960,00:36:16.460
"Let's calculate its
power series expansion.",00:36:16.460,00:36:18.425
"So there's a 2 over
the square root of pi",00:36:21.320,00:36:23.220
"that hurts nobody
here in the front.",00:36:23.220,00:36:27.280
"And now I want to
integrate e^(-t^2),",00:36:27.280,00:36:30.530
"and I'm going to use this
power series expansion for that",00:36:30.530,00:36:34.010
to see what you get.,00:36:34.010,00:36:36.350
"So I'm just going to
write this out I think.",00:36:36.350,00:36:38.800
"I did it out carefully in
another example over there,",00:36:38.800,00:36:41.340
"so I'll do it a
little quicker now.",00:36:41.340,00:36:43.100
"Integrate this term
by term, you're",00:36:43.100,00:36:45.606
"just integrating powers of
t so it's pretty simple,",00:36:45.606,00:36:47.730
"so I get-- and then I'm
evaluating at x and then at 0.",00:36:47.730,00:36:51.830
"So I get x minus x^3 /
3, plus x^5 / (5*2!),",00:36:51.830,00:37:03.690
"5 from integrating
the t^4, and the 2!",00:37:03.690,00:37:07.790
"from this denominator
that we already had.",00:37:07.790,00:37:11.390
"And then there's a -x^7
/ (7*3!), and plus,",00:37:11.390,00:37:18.040
"and so on, and you can imagine
how they go on from there.",00:37:18.040,00:37:21.620
"I guess to get this
exactly in the form",00:37:24.490,00:37:27.500
"that we began talking about,
I should multiply through.",00:37:27.500,00:37:32.510
"So the coefficient of x is 2
over the square root of pi,",00:37:32.510,00:37:35.810
"and the coefficient of x^3 is
-2 over 3 times the square root",00:37:35.810,00:37:39.465
