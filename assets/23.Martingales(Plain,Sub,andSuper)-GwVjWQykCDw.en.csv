"PROFESSOR: OK, I guess we're all
set for getting close to",00:00:23.140,00:00:27.360
"the end, coming now to a race
about whether we could say",00:00:27.360,00:00:31.550
"anything meaningful about
Martingales or not.",00:00:31.550,00:00:35.140
But I think we can.,00:00:35.140,00:00:37.370

reviewing the Wald identity",00:00:37.370,00:00:43.040

tests.",00:00:43.040,00:00:47.380
"It turns out that last
time on the slides--",00:00:47.380,00:00:51.446
"I didn't get the thresholds
confused--",00:00:55.750,00:00:57.690
"I got hypothesis 0 and
hypothesis 1 interchanged from",00:00:57.690,00:01:01.760
the way we usually do them.,00:01:01.760,00:01:03.560
"And it doesn't make
any difference.",00:01:03.560,00:01:05.780
"There's no difference between

way you want to.",00:01:11.520,00:01:13.900

you switch from one to",00:01:13.900,00:01:18.000
"the other when you're halfway
through an argument.",00:01:18.000,00:01:20.520

"want to see them with the

"That should be on there by

"OK, so let's go on and review
what Mr. Wald said.",00:01:44.750,00:01:52.590
"He was talking about
a random walk.",00:01:55.530,00:01:58.820
"Random walk consists of a bunch
of a sequence of IID",00:01:58.820,00:02:02.910
random variables.,00:02:02.910,00:02:04.510
"The random walk consists of the
sequence of partial sums",00:02:04.510,00:02:08.949
of those random variables.,00:02:08.949,00:02:11.100
"And the question is if this
random walk is taking place",00:02:11.100,00:02:16.260
"and you have two thresholds, one
at alpha and one of beta--",00:02:16.260,00:02:21.000
"and beta is below 0 and
alpha is above 0--",00:02:21.000,00:02:24.080
"and you start at 0, of course,
and the question is when do",00:02:24.080,00:02:29.510
"you cross one of these two
thresholds and which",00:02:29.510,00:02:33.550
threshold do cross?,00:02:33.550,00:02:34.790
"What's the probability of
crossing each other, and",00:02:34.790,00:02:38.190
"everything else you can say
about this problem.",00:02:38.190,00:02:41.090
"And it turns out this is a very
major problem as far as",00:02:41.090,00:02:44.990
"stochastic processes are
concerned, because it comes up",00:02:44.990,00:02:49.300
almost everywhere.,00:02:49.300,00:02:50.670
It certainly comes up as far as,00:02:50.670,00:02:54.210
hypothesis testing is concerned.,00:02:54.210,00:02:57.110
"It's probably the major problem
there when you get",00:02:57.110,00:02:59.940
into sequential analysis.,00:02:59.940,00:03:02.710
It's the major problem there.,00:03:02.710,00:03:05.090
"So it's a very important
problem.",00:03:05.090,00:03:07.060
"And what Wald said was if you
let the random variable J be",00:03:07.060,00:03:14.820
"the stopping time of this random
walk, namely, the time",00:03:14.820,00:03:18.960
"in which the walk first crosses
either alpha or",00:03:18.960,00:03:23.340
"crosses the beta, and then he
said no matter what r you",00:03:23.340,00:03:29.090
"choose and the range of points
where the moment generating",00:03:29.090,00:03:34.100
function g sub X of r exists.,00:03:34.100,00:03:38.525
"Y You can pick any r in that
range, and then what you get",00:03:38.525,00:03:43.980
"is this strange looking
equality here.",00:03:43.980,00:03:48.910
"And I pointed out last time it
just wasn't all that strange,",00:03:48.910,00:03:58.030
"because if instead of using the
stopping time of when you",00:03:58.030,00:04:02.720
"cross a threshold, if instead
you used as a stopping time",00:04:02.720,00:04:07.130
just some particular end.,00:04:07.130,00:04:08.640
"You go for some number of steps,
and then you stop.",00:04:08.640,00:04:11.660
"And at that point, you
have the expected",00:04:11.660,00:04:13.440
value of E to the rsn.,00:04:13.440,00:04:17.560
"The expected value of E to the
rsn by definition is the",00:04:17.560,00:04:22.460
"moment generating function at r
of S sub n, which is exactly",00:04:22.460,00:04:30.150
"equal to the minus J times
gamma n times gamma of r.",00:04:30.150,00:04:41.460
"So all we're doing here,
all that Wald did--",00:04:41.460,00:04:46.540
"as it turns out, it
was quite a bit--",00:04:46.540,00:04:48.820
"was to say that when you replace
a fixed end with a",00:04:48.820,00:04:52.430
"stopping time, you still
get the same result.",00:04:52.430,00:04:56.150
"We're stating it here just for
the case of two thresholds.",00:04:56.150,00:04:59.750
"Wald stated it in much
general terms.",00:04:59.750,00:05:01.990
"We'll use it a more general
terms, when we say more about",00:05:01.990,00:05:05.620
martingales.,00:05:05.620,00:05:06.870
"X, now remember is the
underlying random variable.",00:05:11.740,00:05:15.520
S sub n is the sum of the X's.,00:05:15.520,00:05:18.038
"If X bar is less than 0, and
if gamma r star equals 0, r",00:05:29.740,00:05:39.080
"star is the r at which
gamma of r equals 0.",00:05:39.080,00:05:43.140
"It's the second root
of gamma of r.",00:05:43.140,00:05:46.160
"Gamma of r, if you remember,
looks like this.",00:05:46.160,00:06:01.660
This is r star here.,00:06:01.660,00:06:04.230
"This is the expected value
of X as the slope here.",00:06:07.610,00:06:13.420
"And we're assuming that X bar
is less than 0 for this.",00:06:13.420,00:06:18.930
"I don't know how that greater
than 0 got in.",00:06:18.930,00:06:22.380
"And then what it says is the
probability that SJ is greater",00:06:22.380,00:06:26.060
"than or equal to alpha is less
than or equal to the minus",00:06:26.060,00:06:28.810
alpha r star.,00:06:28.810,00:06:30.880
"And last time, remember, we
went through a long, messy",00:06:30.880,00:06:33.080
bunch of equations for that.,00:06:33.080,00:06:35.850
"I looked at it again, and this
is just the simple old Markov",00:06:35.850,00:06:40.520
inequality again.,00:06:40.520,00:06:43.090
"All you do to get this is you
say, OK, think of the random",00:06:43.090,00:06:48.620
"variable, E to the r SJ.",00:06:48.620,00:06:51.730
"SJ is a very complicated random
variable, but it's a",00:06:51.730,00:06:54.220
"random variable, nonetheless.",00:06:54.220,00:06:56.420
"So either the rSJ is a random
variable and the expected",00:06:56.420,00:07:02.960
"value of that random variable
is at r star, the expected",00:07:02.960,00:07:18.960
value of it is just one.,00:07:18.960,00:07:21.165
I'll write down.,00:07:33.430,00:07:34.790
It'll be easier.,00:07:34.790,00:07:37.610
"The expected value e to the r
star S sub J is equal to 1.",00:07:37.610,00:07:47.630
"And therefore, the probability
that E to the r star SJ is a",00:07:47.630,00:08:00.360
"greater than or equal to E to
the r star alpha is just less",00:08:00.360,00:08:10.520
"than or equal to 1 over E
to the r star alpha, OK?",00:08:10.520,00:08:31.820
"And that's what the
inequality says.",00:08:31.820,00:08:33.480
So that's all there is to it.,00:08:33.480,00:08:36.960
"OK, what?",00:08:36.960,00:08:38.700
"AUDIENCE: I don't really see
why these two [INAUDIBLE]?",00:08:38.700,00:08:43.155
They don't [INAUDIBLE].,00:08:43.155,00:08:47.120
"PROFESSOR: You need x1 negative
so that you get",00:08:47.120,00:08:49.610
"another root so that
r star exists.",00:08:49.610,00:08:53.760
"If r star is positive, if the
expected value of x is",00:08:53.760,00:08:58.410
"positive, then r star is down
here at negative r.",00:08:58.410,00:09:03.090
"I mean, you're talking
about the other",00:09:13.000,00:09:14.170
threshold in a sense.,00:09:14.170,00:09:15.790
"OK, this is valid for all
lower thresholds.",00:09:19.900,00:09:26.050
"And it's also valid
for no threshold.",00:09:26.050,00:09:28.850
"OK, in other words, this
equation here does not have",00:09:28.850,00:09:32.760
beta in it at all.,00:09:32.760,00:09:34.630
"So this equation is an upper
bound on the probability, that",00:09:34.630,00:09:41.130
"you're going to cross that
threshold of alpha.",00:09:41.130,00:09:43.960
"And that upper bound is valid,
no matter where you put the",00:09:43.960,00:09:47.550
lower bound at all.,00:09:47.550,00:09:49.480
"So you can go to the
limit as the lower",00:09:49.480,00:09:51.830
bound goes to infinity.,00:09:51.830,00:09:53.930
"And this inequality should
still be valid.",00:09:53.930,00:09:57.120
"You have a homework problem
where you actually prove that.",00:09:57.120,00:10:00.200
"Sometimes when things go to
infinity, funny things happen.",00:10:00.200,00:10:04.050
"And that proves that nothing
funny happens then.",00:10:04.050,00:10:07.790
"So what happens then is the
probability that you ever",00:10:07.790,00:10:13.900
"cross a threshold at plus alpha,
when you have a random",00:10:13.900,00:10:18.000
"variable, which has a negative
mean, is this exponent here.",00:10:18.000,00:10:26.840
"And we also sort of showed by
looking at the turn off bound",00:10:26.840,00:10:31.900
"that this bound is
pretty tight.",00:10:31.900,00:10:34.300
"So in other words, what this
is saying is when you're",00:10:34.300,00:10:37.130
"looking at threshold
crossing problems--",00:10:37.130,00:10:40.740
"this quantity here, this
quantity where the second root",00:10:40.740,00:10:45.560
of gamma of r is--,00:10:45.560,00:10:48.220
"that's sort of the
crucial parameter",00:10:48.220,00:10:50.460
that you want to know.,00:10:50.460,00:10:51.470
"Usually the first thing you want
to know about a random",00:10:51.470,00:10:54.170
"variable is its mean, its
variance, all sorts",00:10:54.170,00:10:57.150
of things like that.,00:10:57.150,00:10:58.640
"This is saying if you're
interested in thresholds,",00:10:58.640,00:11:01.160
"forget about all those things,
look at r star.",00:11:01.160,00:11:05.702
"If r star is positive that means
it means is negative, so",00:11:05.702,00:11:09.320
there's no problem there.,00:11:09.320,00:11:10.580
"But this one quantity here is
sort of the most important",00:11:10.580,00:11:14.700
"parameter of all of
these problems.",00:11:14.700,00:11:18.140
"OK, so let's go back to look at
a hypothesis testing again,",00:11:18.140,00:11:25.900
"where we're looking at the
likelihood ratio of being the",00:11:25.900,00:11:32.750
"ratio of the density for
hypothesis 0 divided by",00:11:32.750,00:11:37.460
hypothesis 1.,00:11:37.460,00:11:39.960
"What you get then is you observe
this sequence Y sub n.",00:11:39.960,00:11:45.480
"These are the observations
that you're taking.",00:11:45.480,00:11:48.360
"In other words, nature at the
beginning of this whole",00:11:48.360,00:11:51.330
"experiment chooses either H
equals 0 or H equals 1.",00:11:51.330,00:11:58.870
"At that point, you start
to make measurements.",00:11:58.870,00:12:02.370
"Now whether nature chooses H
equals 0 before or after or",00:12:02.370,00:12:06.180
"when doesn't make
any difference.",00:12:06.180,00:12:08.220
"The point is the experiment
consists of nature choosing",00:12:08.220,00:12:12.090
one of these two hypotheses.,00:12:12.090,00:12:13.980
"You know all the probabilities
that exist in the world in",00:12:13.980,00:12:18.590
this model.,00:12:18.590,00:12:19.710
"You go making these
measurements.",00:12:19.710,00:12:21.770
"All you of observe is
these measurements.",00:12:21.770,00:12:23.640
"You don't observe what the
hypothesis is, so you define",00:12:23.640,00:12:28.830
"this likelihood ratio of the
ratio of the densities of the",00:12:28.830,00:12:33.760
"vector Y for H equals 0 and the
vector Y with H equals 1.",00:12:33.760,00:12:42.940
"These quantities exist no
matter what the a priori",00:12:42.940,00:12:47.660
probabilities of the thresholds,00:12:47.660,00:12:49.360
are or anything else.,00:12:49.360,00:12:51.470
"Even without all of that, so
long as you have a model which",00:12:51.470,00:12:55.430
"tells you what the densities
of these observations are,",00:12:55.430,00:13:01.680
"conditional on each hypothesis,",00:13:01.680,00:13:04.110
you can define this.,00:13:04.110,00:13:05.140
"This doesn't depend on a priori
probabilities at all.",00:13:05.140,00:13:09.070
"OK, so now you look at the
probability that H is equal to",00:13:09.070,00:13:14.010
"0, given all these observations
divided by the",00:13:14.010,00:13:18.150
probability it's equal to 1.,00:13:18.150,00:13:20.470
"What you get here now,
you have the a priori",00:13:20.470,00:13:23.000
"probabilities, p0 over p1.",00:13:23.000,00:13:26.090
"Here is the likelihood
ratio here.",00:13:26.090,00:13:28.880
"So what you have this p0 over p1
times the likelihood ratio",00:13:28.880,00:13:34.610
of this vector of however many,00:13:34.610,00:13:36.400
observations you have observed.,00:13:36.400,00:13:39.585
"It's just a nice way of breaking
up the problem into",00:13:39.585,00:13:43.350
"the likelihood ratio and the
a priori probabilities.",00:13:43.350,00:13:50.780
"Incidentally, we haven't talked
about this at all, but",00:13:50.780,00:13:55.170
"there's an important idea and
all of this hypothesis testing",00:13:55.170,00:13:59.730
"of a sufficient statistic, and
what do you think a sufficient",00:13:59.730,00:14:03.600
statistic is.,00:14:03.600,00:14:05.380
"It's anything from which
you can calculate",00:14:05.380,00:14:07.630
the likelihood ratio.,00:14:07.630,00:14:10.020
"In other words, what we're
saying here, the point we're",00:14:10.020,00:14:12.480
"making, is that any intelligent
choice of",00:14:12.480,00:14:17.510
"hypothesis is it based on
a threshold test on the",00:14:17.510,00:14:23.090
likelihood ratio.,00:14:23.090,00:14:24.970
"And therefore, the only thing
you can really be interested",00:14:24.970,00:14:29.380
"in in all your observations
is just what is",00:14:29.380,00:14:33.430
the likelihood ratio?,00:14:33.430,00:14:35.190
"If they make all these 1,000
observations complicated sort",00:14:35.190,00:14:38.680
"of thing, you calculate

"And that's the only thing
you're interested in.",00:14:41.680,00:14:44.220
"And anything from which that
number could be calculated is",00:14:44.220,00:14:47.900
a sufficient statistic.,00:14:47.900,00:14:49.900
"And anything from which it can't
be calculated you've",00:14:49.900,00:14:52.720
"thrown away some of the
information that you have.",00:14:52.720,00:14:56.260
"If you study communication and
you study detection, you study",00:14:56.260,00:15:00.140
"how to receive data that's being
sent, what you find is",00:15:00.140,00:15:04.900
"that right at the beginning,
even before you do any",00:15:04.900,00:15:10.000
"detection, even before you do
any filtering, there's some",00:15:10.000,00:15:13.530
"idea of a sufficient
statistic there.",00:15:13.530,00:15:16.490
"That's what you need in order to
calculate everything else.",00:15:16.490,00:15:20.900
"And you want to make sure
that you have that.",00:15:20.900,00:15:23.100
"So that's an important
idea there.",00:15:23.100,00:15:26.240
"OK, but anyway, the MAP rule,
which comes right from this,",00:15:26.240,00:15:34.340
"says if you have these a priori
probabilities, and",00:15:34.340,00:15:38.100
"you're trying to maximize the
probability of choosing",00:15:38.100,00:15:41.380
"correctly, what do you do?",00:15:41.380,00:15:44.750
"Well, your probability of H
equals 0 was the correct",00:15:44.750,00:15:52.290
"hypothesis, given all
the observations you",00:15:52.290,00:15:55.680
"made, is in fact this.",00:15:55.680,00:15:57.440
"The probability that H equals
1 is the correct",00:15:57.440,00:15:59.820
hypothesis is this.,00:15:59.820,00:16:01.670
"What do you do if you want to
maximize the probability of",00:16:01.670,00:16:04.300
being correct?,00:16:04.300,00:16:05.270
"You choose the one
which is biggest.",00:16:05.270,00:16:07.340
"In other words, what you do is
you look at this number.",00:16:07.340,00:16:11.260
"And if this number is bigger
than 1, you choose 0.",00:16:11.260,00:16:14.890
"If it's less than 1, you
choose hypothesis 1.",00:16:14.890,00:16:20.290
"And what it turns out to
is threshold of rule.",00:16:20.290,00:16:23.960
"You take this likelihood
ratio.",00:16:23.960,00:16:26.280
"You compare it with
p1 over p0.",00:16:26.280,00:16:30.020
"And in this case, you
select h equals 0.",00:16:30.020,00:16:34.250
"In this case you select
H equals 1.",00:16:34.250,00:16:37.540
"And the last time I just a 1 and
0 reversed, which is fine,",00:16:37.540,00:16:42.040
"but if you reverse them one
place, you want a reverse them",00:16:42.040,00:16:44.620
every place.,00:16:44.620,00:16:47.550
"And every other threshold test
does something like this,",00:16:47.550,00:16:52.260
"except you replace p1 over p0
with some arbitrary threshold.",00:16:52.260,00:16:56.920
"You say whatever reason you
want to find for that",00:16:56.920,00:16:59.590
"threshold, that's the only
intelligent kind of",00:16:59.590,00:17:03.880
test you can make.,00:17:03.880,00:17:06.460
"OK, then we define the
log-likelihood ratio of the",00:17:06.460,00:17:09.300
"logarithm of the likelihood
ratio.",00:17:09.300,00:17:12.710
"And that was nice because it
was a sum of this quantity",00:17:12.710,00:17:17.970
"related to the individual
observations.",00:17:17.970,00:17:20.339
"For each observation you really
want to know what f of",00:17:20.339,00:17:25.400
"Y given H of Y given 0,
divided by Y given 1.",00:17:25.400,00:17:30.870
You want to divide those two.,00:17:30.870,00:17:32.000
"You want to take the
logarithm of it.",00:17:32.000,00:17:34.060
"And then you have those numbers,
and the sufficient",00:17:34.060,00:17:37.130
"statistic that you're interested
in is just a sum of",00:17:37.130,00:17:41.070
those numbers.,00:17:41.070,00:17:42.530
"So you're looking at a sum
of IID, random variable.",00:17:42.530,00:17:47.385
"IID, why IID?",00:17:47.385,00:17:50.540
"Well, under the hypothesis that
H is equal to 1, those",00:17:50.540,00:17:57.650
Yi's are IID.,00:17:57.650,00:18:00.410
"And therefore under the
hypothesis that",00:18:00.410,00:18:03.000
H is equal to 1.,00:18:03.000,00:18:04.250
"Well, little Zi is just
a sample value.",00:18:09.140,00:18:12.410
"If you look at the random
variable which has these",00:18:12.410,00:18:15.080
"sampled values, Z sub i, under
the probability measure,",00:18:15.080,00:18:21.560
"corresponding to H equals 1,
those Z sub i's are IID.",00:18:21.560,00:18:27.850
"So what that says is when you
look at these sums of random",00:18:27.850,00:18:34.350
"variables, the sum of Zi from
1 to n, under hypothesis H",00:18:34.350,00:18:39.780
"equals 1, what do you get?",00:18:39.780,00:18:43.750
You get a random walk.,00:18:43.750,00:18:46.540
"You get a sum of IID
random variables.",00:18:46.540,00:18:49.935
"If you take more observations,
S sub n just changes.",00:18:53.780,00:18:58.770
"With n changing, then you
have a larger number of",00:18:58.770,00:19:02.020
observations.,00:19:02.020,00:19:02.840
"So the random walk goes a little
further out, and you",00:19:02.840,00:19:06.270
"might get closer to a threshold
or whatever.",00:19:06.270,00:19:08.825
"And that's what we're
trying to do here.",00:19:11.990,00:19:14.110
"OK, so the Z sub i's under the
hypothesis H equals 1, or IID,",00:19:14.110,00:19:20.680
"and the moment generating
function of the Z sub i's",00:19:20.680,00:19:24.820
"given H equals 1, is this.",00:19:24.820,00:19:27.305
Let's be careful about this.,00:19:30.460,00:19:33.220
"The sampled values of the Z
sub i do not depend on the",00:19:33.220,00:19:41.240
hypotheses at all.,00:19:41.240,00:19:43.410
"Namely, you make
an observation.",00:19:43.410,00:19:45.900
"You make an observation
of Y sub i.",00:19:45.900,00:19:49.280
"You calculate Z sub
i from Y sub i.",00:19:49.280,00:19:52.730
"That has nothing to do
with whether H equals",00:19:52.730,00:19:55.910
0 or H equals 1.,00:19:55.910,00:19:58.270
"You try to calculate
this moment",00:19:58.270,00:20:00.940
"generating function, however.",00:20:00.940,00:20:03.250
"And you want to know what
the probability",00:20:03.250,00:20:05.980
density of the Y's are.,00:20:05.980,00:20:09.870
"And you get a different
probability density for H",00:20:09.870,00:20:13.140
"equals 1, then you get on
the other hypothesis.",00:20:13.140,00:20:16.500
"If the observations behaved
the same way under both",00:20:16.500,00:20:19.850
"hypotheses, it wouldn't make
much sense to do the",00:20:19.850,00:20:24.500
observation.,00:20:24.500,00:20:25.450
"Unless you have a government
grant, and you're trying to",00:20:25.450,00:20:27.580
"get money out of the government
instead of trying",00:20:27.580,00:20:30.130
to do anything worthwhile.,00:20:30.130,00:20:32.470
"Under those circumstances, you
keep on making observations.",00:20:32.470,00:20:35.690
"You now perfectly well
that nothing is going",00:20:35.690,00:20:38.560
to come from them.,00:20:38.560,00:20:39.830
"But otherwise, it's
a little silly.",00:20:39.830,00:20:42.310
"So this moment generating
function under the hypothesis",00:20:42.310,00:20:46.690
"H equals 1 is given by
this quantity here.",00:20:46.690,00:20:52.150
"And this density here is the
same as this density here.",00:20:52.150,00:20:57.630
"So you get this density to the
1 minus r power, and you get",00:20:57.630,00:21:03.590
this density to the r power.,00:21:03.590,00:21:06.130
"So you get the product of
these two densities.",00:21:06.130,00:21:09.210
"You integrate it over Y, and
that's what gamma 1 of r is.",00:21:09.210,00:21:16.200
"Now I said that the really
important thing in all of",00:21:16.200,00:21:18.780
"these threshold problems
is what is our star?",00:21:18.780,00:21:23.990
"And for this problem,
r star is trivial.",00:21:23.990,00:21:27.180
It's always the same.,00:21:27.180,00:21:28.640
r star is always equal to 1.,00:21:28.640,00:21:31.570
"And the reason is when you set
r equal to 1 here, this",00:21:31.570,00:21:37.160
quantity becomes 1.,00:21:37.160,00:21:39.080
"This quantity becomes
the density of Y",00:21:39.080,00:21:41.860
conditional on H equals 0.,00:21:41.860,00:21:44.370
"When you integrate
that, you get 1.",00:21:44.370,00:21:46.990
"So for all of these hypothesis
testing problems, r star is",00:21:46.990,00:21:53.100
equal to 1.,00:21:53.100,00:21:56.150
Gamma 1 of 1 is equal to 0.,00:21:56.150,00:22:00.050
"And this is what this
curve says.",00:22:00.050,00:22:02.405
"OK, this is gamma 1 of r here.",00:22:10.660,00:22:17.220
"This curve starts out here,
negative slope.",00:22:17.220,00:22:20.450
It comes up here.,00:22:20.450,00:22:22.030
"r star is equal to
1 in this case.",00:22:22.030,00:22:26.630
"And that's sort of the end
of the story for that.",00:22:26.630,00:22:29.565
"Now if you are doing a test with
a fixed value of n, you",00:22:33.080,00:22:38.660
"say I'm going to make
n observations, it's",00:22:38.660,00:22:41.000
all I have time for.,00:22:41.000,00:22:42.770
The week is over.,00:22:42.770,00:22:44.180
"I'm going on vacation
next week.",00:22:44.180,00:22:46.680
I've got to stop this test.,00:22:46.680,00:22:48.580
I've got to write my paper.,00:22:48.580,00:22:50.730
Take the end test.,00:22:50.730,00:22:52.290
You write your paper.,00:22:52.290,00:22:54.170
And what do you do?,00:22:54.170,00:22:56.820
"You go through the optimal
tests the best you can.",00:22:56.820,00:23:01.420
"And what you find is given H
equals 1, an error is going to",00:23:01.420,00:23:05.910
"occur if the sum of random
variables, namely the",00:23:05.910,00:23:11.020
"log-likelihood likelihood ratio,
exceeds the logarithm",00:23:11.020,00:23:14.800
of your threshold.,00:23:14.800,00:23:16.490
"OK, this is whatever threshold
you decide to establish.",00:23:16.490,00:23:20.650
"And we showed before that the
probability that S sub n is",00:23:20.650,00:23:27.580
"greater than or equal to log of
the threshold is evaluated",00:23:27.580,00:23:33.290
"as E to the n times this
quantity right here.",00:23:33.290,00:23:37.220
"The probability of error
given H equals 1 is",00:23:37.220,00:23:40.210
this quantity here.,00:23:40.210,00:23:41.430
"Probability of error given H
equals 1 is the probability",00:23:41.430,00:23:45.380
"that the data looks like
H equals 0 was a right",00:23:45.380,00:23:48.880
hypothesis.,00:23:48.880,00:23:49.720
"In other words, that you crossed
the threshold at plus",00:23:49.720,00:23:52.690
"alpha, instead of crossing
the threshold at beta.",00:23:52.690,00:23:55.790
Excuse me.,00:23:59.710,00:24:02.660
"We have too many cases
here we're looking",00:24:02.660,00:24:04.590
"at, so it gets confusing.",00:24:04.590,00:24:07.300
"What I'm looking at here is
the probability that the",00:24:07.300,00:24:11.810
"log-likelihood ratio exceeds
this threshold data, whatever",00:24:11.810,00:24:16.090
we set beta to be.,00:24:16.090,00:24:18.380
"Eta is set, depending on the
cost of making errors of both",00:24:18.380,00:24:22.230
"types on our a priori beta,
if we have any and",00:24:22.230,00:24:26.955
all of those things.,00:24:26.955,00:24:28.420
"And the probability of error
given H equals 1 is this",00:24:28.420,00:24:31.920
"quantity here, which has the
threshold in it over there.",00:24:31.920,00:24:36.490
"We've looked at that a number
of times in a lecture.",00:24:36.490,00:24:41.070
"We looked at it in
chapter one.",00:24:41.070,00:24:42.950
"And then those, we looked
at it in chapter seven.",00:24:42.950,00:24:46.510
"And you calculate it by taking
this moment generating",00:24:46.510,00:24:50.220
"function, drawing attention to
it at the point where slope",00:24:50.220,00:24:58.480
"natural log of eta
divided by n.",00:24:58.480,00:25:02.430
"And then you take where
it comes in to this",00:25:02.430,00:25:05.200
vertical axis here.,00:25:05.200,00:25:07.140
"And that's the exponent of the
error of probability when",00:25:07.140,00:25:13.690
hypothesis 1 is correct.,00:25:13.690,00:25:16.206
"Now, if the hypothesis is H
equals 0 instead, at that",00:25:16.206,00:25:23.050
"point with H equals 0, the
expected value of this",00:25:23.050,00:25:29.630
"log-likelihood ratio is
going to be positive.",00:25:29.630,00:25:32.860
"The situation is going to be a
curve that comes over here,",00:25:32.860,00:25:37.800
comes back at some point here.,00:25:37.800,00:25:40.080
"And what we've showed is that
this curve is just a",00:25:40.080,00:25:44.040
"translation of this
curve by 1.",00:25:44.040,00:25:47.630
"OK, namely if you calculate the
moment generating function",00:25:47.630,00:25:53.770
"for H equals 0, you get the same
thing that we got before.",00:25:53.770,00:25:59.450
"I'm not going to go through
all the details of this.",00:26:01.970,00:26:04.390
"Now you have 0 here
instead of 1.",00:26:06.890,00:26:09.695
"Over here you're going
to have just minus r.",00:26:13.740,00:26:19.540
"And over here you're going
to have 1 plus r.",00:26:19.540,00:26:25.440
"So this whole thing is
translated by 1.",00:26:25.440,00:26:29.170
The action happens here.,00:26:29.170,00:26:30.860
"But if you translate it by 1
over in this direction, what",00:26:30.860,00:26:35.010
"happens is the error
of probability is",00:26:35.010,00:26:38.590
determined by this.,00:26:38.590,00:26:41.160
It's this.,00:26:44.220,00:26:45.560
"The exponent is this point right
here, gamma 1 of r0 plus",00:26:45.560,00:26:49.800
"1 minus r0, log of eta over n.",00:26:49.800,00:26:53.430
"And the r0 was again determined
by this point at",00:26:53.430,00:26:57.280
"which the slope is equal
to log eta over n.",00:26:57.280,00:27:00.718
We did that before.,00:27:03.240,00:27:04.490
"Then I want to make clear you
understood it, because to",00:27:10.450,00:27:13.440
"really understand it, you have
to go through the arithmetic",00:27:13.440,00:27:16.100
yourselves at least once.,00:27:16.100,00:27:18.190
"And you can do that easily by
following the notes, because",00:27:18.190,00:27:21.860
"it does it in almost
excruciating detail.",00:27:21.860,00:27:25.650
"So that's the argument
you get.",00:27:25.650,00:27:29.820
"We had this idea before, of the
Neyman-Pearson principle,",00:27:29.820,00:27:36.380
"which says you don't assume
a priori probabilities.",00:27:36.380,00:27:40.750
"You look at the probability of

make when H is equal to 1",00:27:45.450,00:27:50.160
"and the error you make
when H is equal to 0.",00:27:50.160,00:27:53.380
"In terms of the Chernoff
bound, this",00:27:53.380,00:27:55.270
trade off is very clear.,00:27:55.270,00:27:57.320
"As you change the exponent that
you want to get under H",00:28:00.700,00:28:05.200
"equals 1, this point moves.",00:28:05.200,00:28:09.810
The tangent then moves.,00:28:09.810,00:28:12.330
"And the exponent over
here moves.",00:28:12.330,00:28:14.300
"So you have this inverted
seesaw.",00:28:14.300,00:28:16.950

of error is over here.",00:28:16.950,00:28:20.170

kind of error is over there.",00:28:20.170,00:28:24.790

sure you're right.",00:28:44.210,00:28:45.885

you do experiments and",00:28:53.620,00:28:59.840
"you keep on making observations
until you get the",00:28:59.840,00:29:02.420

something very",00:29:02.420,00:29:05.760
unethical about that.,00:29:05.760,00:29:08.960

unethical behavior?",00:29:08.960,00:29:12.580
Or is this really valid?,00:29:12.580,00:29:13.830
"Well, I claim this is valid,
because what we're doing when",00:29:17.770,00:29:21.840
"we're doing sequential testing
is we're deciding what we're",00:29:21.840,00:29:27.050
going to do ahead of time.,00:29:27.050,00:29:29.390

going to do is we're",00:29:29.390,00:29:31.900
"going to continue testing until
we cross a threshold and",00:29:31.900,00:29:36.550

we get a very small error",00:29:49.250,00:29:54.230
"probability by using a smaller
number of observations on the",00:29:54.230,00:29:59.240

What are you going to do?,00:30:23.140,00:30:25.250
"You're going to send this data
a very large number of times",00:30:25.250,00:30:27.920
"or use a very powerful coding
technique on it.",00:30:27.920,00:30:31.960

you're going to be very sure",00:30:31.960,00:30:35.790
you're right.,00:30:35.790,00:30:38.860

the thing which is used in",00:30:38.860,00:30:42.780
"almost all communication
systems, and the thing which",00:30:42.780,00:30:46.600

us have common sense if we",00:30:53.120,00:30:57.150

these things, is instead of",00:30:57.150,00:31:01.840

second time.",00:31:13.440,00:31:16.550

looking at it, what we do is",00:31:21.390,00:31:26.500

what our procedure is",00:31:26.500,00:31:30.250
"going to be for making
repetitions--",00:31:30.250,00:31:33.043
"something called ARQ in
communication systems, which",00:31:36.090,00:31:39.100
"means automatic repeat

going to send it over again.",00:32:01.110,00:32:04.310
"That's exactly the same sort
of thing we're doing here.",00:32:04.310,00:32:08.740
"OK, when we do that, given H
equals 1, we again have this S",00:32:08.740,00:32:17.810
"sub n as a function of

have a negative slope on this",00:32:28.950,00:32:33.810

going down forever.",00:32:38.480,00:32:41.380
"And if you're looking for
across some positive",00:32:41.380,00:32:43.580

it pretty soon, it's not going",00:32:43.580,00:32:46.640
to cross it.,00:32:46.640,00:32:47.490

H is equal to 0.,00:32:56.950,00:32:58.610
"If we ever cross the negative

H is equal to 1.,00:33:01.410,00:33:02.630
And then we're done with it.,00:33:02.630,00:33:05.600
"OK, now, let me give you another
argument why that",00:33:05.600,00:33:10.200
makes sense.,00:33:10.200,00:33:10.920
"I gave you one argument
last time.",00:33:10.920,00:33:13.250
"I'll give you another
argument this time.",00:33:13.250,00:33:14.930
"If S sub J is greater than or
equal to 0, we're going to",00:33:18.780,00:33:28.730
"decide that 0 is the
correct hypothesis.",00:33:28.730,00:33:32.550
"If H equals 1 is the correct
hypothesis, then we're going",00:33:35.300,00:33:40.370
"make an error when S
sub J is greater",00:33:40.370,00:33:42.750
than or equal to alpha.,00:33:42.750,00:33:44.571
"If S sub J is less than or equal
to the beta, we're going",00:33:44.571,00:33:47.010
to decide H equals 1.,00:33:47.010,00:33:50.410
"And conditional on H equals 1,
an error is made if SJ is",00:33:50.410,00:33:54.810
"greater than or equal
to alpha.",00:33:54.810,00:33:56.560
"Conditional on H equals 0, an
error is made if SJ is less",00:33:56.560,00:34:00.710
than or equal to beta.,00:34:00.710,00:34:02.570
"OK, so the probability of the
error conditional on H equals",00:34:02.570,00:34:06.880
"1 is the probability that S sub
J is greater than or equal",00:34:06.880,00:34:12.090
"to alpha, given H equals 1,
which is less than or equal to",00:34:12.090,00:34:16.370
E to the minus alpha or star.,00:34:16.370,00:34:18.120
"This is the thing that
we said before.",00:34:18.120,00:34:22.340
"r star is the root
of gamma of r.",00:34:22.340,00:34:25.270
"And gamma of r is
equal to this.",00:34:25.270,00:34:29.840
"OK, so, let's just make life a
little easier for ourselves",00:34:29.840,00:34:38.060
"assume that our a priori
probabilities are each 1/2.",00:34:38.060,00:34:43.050
"This is also called maximum
likelihood decision.",00:34:43.050,00:34:47.810
"You take this likelihood ratio,
and you just decide on",00:34:47.810,00:34:51.300
"the basis of the likelihood
ratio.",00:34:51.300,00:34:54.770
"OK, then at the end of trial
end, the probability of H",00:34:54.770,00:34:58.790
"equals 0 given Sn divided by the
probability of H equals 1",00:34:58.790,00:35:03.850
"given Sn, the a prioris
cancel out.",00:35:03.850,00:35:07.120
It is just E to the S sub n.,00:35:07.120,00:35:11.260
That's what it is.,00:35:11.260,00:35:12.510
It's the likelihood ratio.,00:35:15.000,00:35:17.230
"S sub n is the log-likelihood
ratio.",00:35:17.230,00:35:21.100
So this is what it is.,00:35:21.100,00:35:24.360
"If you now take probability of H
equals 0 on probability that",00:35:24.360,00:35:30.190
"H equals 1 given S of
in, this equation",00:35:30.190,00:35:34.130
becomes this equation.,00:35:34.130,00:35:36.440
"And then the probability of H
equals 1 given S sub n is just",00:35:36.440,00:35:40.560
"E to the minus Sn over 1
plus E to the minus Sn.",00:35:40.560,00:35:44.910
"Now if Sn is a large number, E
to the minus Sn is going to be",00:35:44.910,00:35:50.210
totally trivial.,00:35:50.210,00:35:52.120
"And the probability that
H equals 1 given Sn is",00:35:52.120,00:35:55.570
essentially E to the minus Sn.,00:35:55.570,00:35:58.730
"It means when you can choose
different values of n, this",00:35:58.730,00:36:04.260
"very directly gives you
a control on what the",00:36:04.260,00:36:06.990
probability of error is.,00:36:06.990,00:36:08.900
"The probability of error is
essentially E to the minus Sn.",00:36:08.900,00:36:13.680
"So if you choose a threshold
alpha, what you're doing is",00:36:13.680,00:36:17.210
"you're guaranteeing that the
probability of error cannot be",00:36:17.210,00:36:20.450
"less than E to the
minus alpha.",00:36:20.450,00:36:23.080
"OK, so this is more than just
talking about averages.",00:36:23.080,00:36:27.650
"This is saying if you use a
threshold rule, then what",00:36:27.650,00:36:31.120
"you're doing is guaranteeing
that the probability of error",00:36:31.120,00:36:34.600
"is never going to be less
than this quantity",00:36:34.600,00:36:37.360
of specified here.,00:36:37.360,00:36:39.720
"OK, we saw last time the cost of
choosing alpha to be large",00:36:39.720,00:36:43.940
"is that you have to make a very
large number of trials,",00:36:43.940,00:36:48.060
at least given H equals 0.,00:36:48.060,00:36:50.010
"Why don't I worry about
the number of trials",00:36:50.010,00:36:53.770
for H equals 1?,00:36:53.770,00:36:56.840
"I mean, it's nothing to be
thought through here.",00:36:56.840,00:37:00.590
"If my thresholds are large,
my probability of",00:37:00.590,00:37:04.370
error is very small.,00:37:04.370,00:37:05.620
"The expected values of things
for very large log-likelihood",00:37:08.060,00:37:17.530
"ratios are determined almost
entirely by H equals 0.",00:37:17.530,00:37:22.800
H equals 1 sometimes.,00:37:22.800,00:37:24.610
"You sometimes make a mistake,
because it's something very,",00:37:24.610,00:37:27.250
very unusual.,00:37:27.250,00:37:28.730
"But that has very little
influence on the expected",00:37:28.730,00:37:31.450
number of tests you're making.,00:37:31.450,00:37:33.680
"So what happens then is the
expected number of tests you",00:37:33.680,00:37:38.960
"make under the hypothesis
that H is equal to 0--",00:37:38.960,00:37:42.790
now we're using Wald's equality,00:37:45.580,00:37:47.440
rather than Wald's identity--,00:37:47.440,00:37:49.540
"it's equal to the expected
value of S sub J given H",00:37:49.540,00:37:52.720
"equals 0, divided by the
expected value of Z,",00:37:52.720,00:37:56.530
given H equals 0.,00:37:56.530,00:37:57.780
"Z is the log-likelihood
ratio of one trial.",00:38:01.150,00:38:05.940
"This is just Wald's
equality with this",00:38:05.940,00:38:10.650
condition thrown into it.,00:38:10.650,00:38:12.710
"Now what's the expected value
of SJ given H equals 0?",00:38:12.710,00:38:17.290
"It's essentially alpha, and if
you want to be more careful,",00:38:17.290,00:38:20.780
"it's alpha plus the expected
overshoot given H equals 0.",00:38:20.780,00:38:26.720
"And that's divided by the
expected value of Z,",00:38:26.720,00:38:29.960
given H equals 0.,00:38:29.960,00:38:31.090
"This is the answer
we got last time.",00:38:31.090,00:38:32.990
"So the number of tests you have
to make, if you set a",00:38:36.260,00:38:39.520
"positive threshold alpha, is
essentially the number of",00:38:39.520,00:38:43.820
"tests you have to make when
the hypothesis is equal 0.",00:38:43.820,00:38:48.310
"So the funny thing which is
happening here is that as you",00:38:48.310,00:38:52.400
"change alpha, you're changing
the probability of error for",00:38:52.400,00:38:56.760
hypothesis H equals 1.,00:38:56.760,00:39:00.810
"And you're changing the number
of tests you're going to have",00:39:00.810,00:39:02.830
to do when H is equal to 0.,00:39:02.830,00:39:05.290
"When you change beta, it's
just the opposite.",00:39:05.290,00:39:08.650
"So that when you change beta, if
you make beta a very large",00:39:08.650,00:39:13.130
"negative, you have to make an
enormous number of tests under",00:39:13.130,00:39:17.720
"the circumstance that
H is equal to 1.",00:39:17.720,00:39:20.750
"But you might make an error
when H is equal to 0.",00:39:20.750,00:39:24.700
"So the trade off is between
number of trials under one",00:39:24.700,00:39:30.270
"hypothesis, error of probability
under the other",00:39:30.270,00:39:33.700
hypothesis.,00:39:33.700,00:39:34.950
"That's almost all we wanted to
say about Wald's identity.",00:39:39.300,00:39:43.140
"There's one other huge thing
that we want to talk about.",00:39:43.140,00:39:46.426
"If you take the first two
derivatives of Wald's identity",00:39:48.990,00:39:54.470
"at r equals 0, you get some
interesting things coming out.",00:39:54.470,00:40:00.360

can use it any value",00:40:00.360,00:40:03.080
of r you want to.,00:40:03.080,00:40:05.430

value of r, you that an",00:40:05.430,00:40:08.190

large deviations.",00:40:08.190,00:40:11.520

of r, you get something",00:40:11.520,00:40:15.650
more about typical cases.,00:40:15.650,00:40:18.220
"So looking at it at r equals 0,
what you want to do is you",00:40:18.220,00:40:25.590
"want to take the derivative
with respect",00:40:25.590,00:40:28.970
to r of Wald's identity.,00:40:28.970,00:40:34.170
"This expected value in here
we know is equal to 1.",00:40:34.170,00:40:37.720
"It's equal to 1 whatever
value of r we choose.",00:40:37.720,00:40:41.050
"And therefore, when we take
the derivative of this, we",00:40:41.050,00:40:45.140
have to get 0.,00:40:45.140,00:40:46.890
"But we also want to take
the derivative of it",00:40:46.890,00:40:49.150
to see what we get.,00:40:49.150,00:40:50.670
"So when you take the derivative
of this quantity",00:40:50.670,00:40:53.460
"here and you don't worry
about what exists and",00:40:53.460,00:40:56.260
what doesn't exist--,00:40:56.260,00:40:57.510
"you have to take the
derivative here--",00:41:01.250,00:41:03.290
so you get an S sub J there.,00:41:03.290,00:41:07.470
"You take the derivative
here, you get a",00:41:07.470,00:41:09.340
gamma prime of r there.,00:41:09.340,00:41:11.190
"If you get SJ minus J times
gamma prime of r, and this E",00:41:11.190,00:41:15.440
"to the what have you
just sits there.",00:41:15.440,00:41:19.110
"You take the derivative of E
to something, you never get",00:41:19.110,00:41:22.450
rid of the E to something.,00:41:22.450,00:41:23.580
"You just get piled up stuff
in front of it.",00:41:23.580,00:41:27.300
"OK, so when we evaluate that at
r equals 0, what happens?",00:41:27.300,00:41:33.840
"Well, what's the value of
the gamma prime of 0?",00:41:33.840,00:41:36.380
"It's the expected
value of X, yes.",00:41:40.180,00:41:42.120
"And this quantity here is all
equal to 1, so we can forget",00:41:48.060,00:41:53.860
about that.,00:41:53.860,00:41:56.140
"When r is equal to 0,
this is equal to 0.",00:41:56.140,00:42:00.530
"When r is equal to 0, gamma
of r is equal to 0.",00:42:00.530,00:42:04.320
"So this whole thing
in here is 0.",00:42:04.320,00:42:07.810
So E to the 0 is 1.,00:42:07.810,00:42:09.510
So we've got a 1 there.,00:42:09.510,00:42:11.070
"We got expected value of
S sub J minus J times X",00:42:11.070,00:42:16.870
bar is equal to 0.,00:42:16.870,00:42:19.770
What is that?,00:42:19.770,00:42:20.290
That's Wald's equality.,00:42:20.290,00:42:22.190
"So Wald's equality falls out of
the Wald's identity as what",00:42:22.190,00:42:27.260
"happens as the derivative
of Wald's identity",00:42:27.260,00:42:31.630
that r equals 0.,00:42:31.630,00:42:34.000
"Well, since we're so successful
with that, let's go",00:42:34.000,00:42:36.975
"on and take another
derivative.",00:42:36.975,00:42:38.360
Yes?,00:42:40.860,00:42:41.566
"AUDIENCE: I guess you want the
final equal to 0 [INAUDIBLE].",00:42:41.566,00:42:46.180
"PROFESSOR: Oh, the final equal
to 0 comes from the fact that",00:42:46.180,00:42:49.970
"this quantity here that you're
starting with is equal to 1",00:42:49.970,00:42:54.080
for all values of r.,00:42:54.080,00:42:56.120
"Therefore, I want to take
the derivative with",00:42:56.120,00:42:57.680
"respect to r, I get 0.",00:42:57.680,00:43:01.130
So that's one equation.,00:43:01.130,00:43:02.750
"The other thing is I just go
through the mechanics of",00:43:02.750,00:43:05.100
taking the derivative.,00:43:05.100,00:43:07.400
"OK, so let's try to take
the second derivative.",00:43:07.400,00:43:11.720
"Take the second derivative by
taking the derivative of the",00:43:11.720,00:43:16.360
first derivative.,00:43:16.360,00:43:18.290
"And what happens is then is this
quantity in here I get an",00:43:18.290,00:43:26.370
"extra term of that sitting
over there.",00:43:26.370,00:43:29.320
"And along with that, I get the
derivative of this with",00:43:29.320,00:43:31.840
respect to r.,00:43:31.840,00:43:33.090
"I should probably have written
that down there but since I",00:43:35.480,00:43:39.060
"didn't, let me see
if I can do it.",00:43:39.060,00:43:47.160
"I get the expected value of SJ
minus J gamma prime of r.",00:43:47.160,00:44:03.740
"And this quantity
is squared now,",00:44:03.740,00:44:05.650
because I have this there.,00:44:05.650,00:44:07.450
"I'm taking the derivative of
this term with respect to r.",00:44:07.450,00:44:11.780
"And also, I have to take the
derivative of this with",00:44:11.780,00:44:16.190
respect to r.,00:44:16.190,00:44:17.700
"So that gives me minus J times
gamma double prime of r.",00:44:17.700,00:44:25.630
"And all of this times E to the
r SJ minus J gamma of r.",00:44:25.630,00:44:41.570
"Now I want to evaluate
this at r equals 0.",00:44:45.260,00:44:49.990
"Evaluating this at r equals
0, this term goes away.",00:44:49.990,00:44:54.510
"So I wind up with the expected
value of SJ minus J gamma",00:44:54.510,00:45:04.030
"prime of r where minus J
gamma double prime of",00:45:04.030,00:45:12.240
r is equal to 0.,00:45:12.240,00:45:17.740
"Well, this doesn't look bad.",00:45:17.740,00:45:20.060
"But if you try to use it if you
expand this term here, you",00:45:20.060,00:45:23.700
"get a term the expected value of
S of J times J. And you can",00:45:23.700,00:45:30.480
struggle with that.,00:45:30.480,00:45:32.440
And it's ugly.,00:45:32.440,00:45:33.900
That's very ugly.,00:45:33.900,00:45:34.920
"But if you now say, if
we have a mean we",00:45:34.920,00:45:43.340
can use Wald's equality.,00:45:43.340,00:45:45.200
"It tells us what we
want to know.",00:45:45.200,00:45:47.150
"If we don't have a mean, then
Wald's equality doesn't tell",00:45:47.150,00:45:51.170
us anything.,00:45:51.170,00:45:53.320
"But this is going to
tell us something.",00:45:53.320,00:45:55.670
"So we're going to make the
assumption here that r is",00:45:55.670,00:45:59.100
"equal to 0 and X bar
is equal to 0.",00:45:59.100,00:46:06.525
"And if X bar is equal
to 0, gamma prime of",00:46:09.340,00:46:13.590
0 is equal to 0.,00:46:13.590,00:46:17.170
"And gamma double prime of 0 is
equal to sigma squared of X.",00:46:17.170,00:46:29.540
So you do all of that.,00:46:29.540,00:46:31.810
"What you get is the expected
value of S sub J squared minus",00:46:31.810,00:46:37.030
"sigma X squared of
J is equal to 0.",00:46:37.030,00:46:42.070
"This is the same kind
of thing that we",00:46:42.070,00:46:45.460
got from Wald's equality.,00:46:45.460,00:46:48.360
"From Wald's equality, it didn't
tell us anything.",00:46:48.360,00:46:52.130
"It just gave us a relationship
between the expected value of",00:46:52.130,00:46:56.100
"S sub J and expected
value of J. This is",00:46:56.100,00:46:59.780
doing the same thing.,00:46:59.780,00:47:01.180
"It's giving us a relationship
between the expected value of",00:47:01.180,00:47:05.540
"S sub J squared and the expected
value of J. So we get",00:47:05.540,00:47:12.040
the same kind of quantity.,00:47:12.040,00:47:13.930
"It's doing the same
thing for us.",00:47:13.930,00:47:16.970
"Now you look at this for a 0
means simple random walk.",00:47:16.970,00:47:27.530
"Now you would have thought
before you started to take",00:47:27.530,00:47:29.590
"this class that a simple random
walk with mean 0 was",00:47:29.590,00:47:34.390
"the simplest thing
in the world.",00:47:34.390,00:47:37.350
"And we've seen by looking at
that it really isn't all that",00:47:37.350,00:47:41.010
"simple, that you come play these
silly games like you can",00:47:41.010,00:47:45.830
"gamble forever, where with
probability 1/2 you lose $1,",00:47:45.830,00:47:50.750
"with probability 1/2
you win $1--",00:47:50.750,00:47:53.590
perfectly fair game.,00:47:53.590,00:47:55.420
"And with probability one, you
to make $1 out of that, and",00:47:55.420,00:47:58.365
quit and go home.,00:47:58.365,00:48:00.140
"And since you to make $1 out of
it, and quit and go home,",00:48:00.140,00:48:03.470
"you can then quickly come
back again and it again.",00:48:03.470,00:48:06.610
You can make $2.,00:48:06.610,00:48:07.960
You can make $10.,00:48:07.960,00:48:09.440
"You can make $1,000.",00:48:09.440,00:48:10.750
"You can make $1 million
with probability 1.",00:48:10.750,00:48:14.770
"So the simple random walk
is no longer simple.",00:48:14.770,00:48:17.840
It becomes puzzling.,00:48:17.840,00:48:19.820
"But Wald's identity is dealing
with two thresholds, one of",00:48:19.820,00:48:23.910
alpha and one at beta.,00:48:23.910,00:48:27.390
"When we apply this and you
observe it as a simple random",00:48:27.390,00:48:34.380
"walk, where you either go up
by 1 or go down by 1, each",00:48:34.380,00:48:39.810
"with probability 1/2, the
mean of X is 0 and the",00:48:39.810,00:48:44.410
variance of X is 1.,00:48:44.410,00:48:46.730
So this quantity here is 1.,00:48:46.730,00:48:49.900
"You can then play games with
what the probability is that",00:48:49.900,00:48:56.240
"you hit the upper threshold and
the probability that you",00:48:56.240,00:48:59.526
hit the lower threshold.,00:48:59.526,00:49:01.150
"I mean, it's done in the text.",00:49:01.150,00:49:02.270
"You don't have to take
my word for it.",00:49:02.270,00:49:05.390
"And when you do that, what you
find is the expected value of",00:49:05.390,00:49:09.680
"J is equal to minus
beta times alpha.",00:49:09.680,00:49:14.230
"Theta is a negative number,
remember, so this is expected",00:49:14.230,00:49:18.000
"value of J is the magnitude
of theta times the",00:49:18.000,00:49:22.690
magnitude of alpha.,00:49:22.690,00:49:23.940
"Now that's a little bizarre, but
then you think about it a",00:49:26.290,00:49:30.230
little bit.,00:49:30.230,00:49:31.370
You think what happens.,00:49:31.370,00:49:34.410
And this is really exact.,00:49:34.410,00:49:36.310
"I mean, this isn't an
approximation or anything.",00:49:36.310,00:49:40.720
"If alpha is very large, and
beta is very large and",00:49:40.720,00:49:45.000
"negative, and you play this
random walk game, you're going",00:49:45.000,00:49:50.050
to fluctuate a long time.,00:49:50.050,00:49:52.250
"You're going to disperse
slowly.",00:49:52.250,00:49:54.350
"You're going to disperse
according to the square root",00:49:54.350,00:49:56.920
"of n, or the number
of tests you take.",00:49:56.920,00:50:00.010
"So the amount of time it takes
you until you get way out to",00:50:00.010,00:50:03.720
these thresholds should be--,00:50:03.720,00:50:08.330
"to the namely the value
that n has to have--",00:50:08.330,00:50:16.080
"roughly the square of alpha
when beta and alpha",00:50:16.080,00:50:19.990
are both the same.,00:50:19.990,00:50:21.040
"This is something more
general than that.",00:50:21.040,00:50:22.820
"It says that if Sn, the
stop-when-you're-ahead game,",00:50:22.820,00:50:27.950
"we make alpha equals 1, the
expected value of J depends on",00:50:27.950,00:50:34.820
what the lower threshold is.,00:50:34.820,00:50:37.110
"And that suddenly makes sense,
because what that's saying is",00:50:37.110,00:50:41.870
"if we have a lower threshold at
10, an upper threshold at",00:50:41.870,00:50:45.530
"one, then most of the
time you win.",00:50:45.530,00:50:54.170
"But when you lose,
you lose $10.",00:50:54.170,00:50:57.250
"When you win, you win, $1.",00:50:57.250,00:50:58.900
"When you set a lower threshold
at 100, when you",00:50:58.900,00:51:02.000
"lose, you lose $100.",00:51:02.000,00:51:03.800
"When you win, you win $1.",00:51:03.800,00:51:06.370
"And suddenly, that
stop-when-you're-ahead game",00:51:06.370,00:51:09.310
"does not look quite as
attractive as it did before.",00:51:09.310,00:51:13.300
"What you're doing is taking a
chance where you're probably",00:51:13.300,00:51:17.290
"going to win of winning $1, and
you're risking your life's",00:51:17.290,00:51:22.950
"assets for it, which doesn't
make too much sense anymore.",00:51:22.950,00:51:27.470
"OK this, I think, it gives you
a better idea of what's going",00:51:27.470,00:51:32.200
"on on the simple random walk
than anything else I've seen.",00:51:32.200,00:51:36.600
"So it's time to start talking
about martingales.",00:51:50.210,00:51:53.100
"A martingale, like most of the
other things we've been",00:51:56.570,00:51:59.740
"talking about in the
course, is a",00:51:59.740,00:52:02.120
sequence of random variables.,00:52:02.120,00:52:05.320
"This is a more general kind of
sequence than most of them.",00:52:05.320,00:52:08.650
"Almost all of the processes
we've talked about so far have",00:52:12.085,00:52:16.200
"been the kinds of things you can
sort of get your hands on.",00:52:16.200,00:52:20.400
"And this is defined very
abstractly in terms of a",00:52:20.400,00:52:23.950
peculiar property that it has.,00:52:23.950,00:52:26.690
"And then the peculiar property
it has is the expected value",00:52:26.690,00:52:31.500
"as the nth term, in this thing
called a martingale,",00:52:31.500,00:52:36.320
"conditional on knowing the
values of all the previous",00:52:36.320,00:52:40.010
"values, expected value of Z sub
n given the value of Z and",00:52:40.010,00:52:45.340
"minus 1, Z and minus 2, all the
way down to Z1 is equal to",00:52:45.340,00:52:50.130
Z sub n minus 1.,00:52:50.130,00:52:52.590
"Namely, the expected value here
is what you had there.",00:52:52.590,00:53:00.330
"The word martingale comes from
gambling, where gamblers used",00:53:00.330,00:53:05.370
"to spend a great deal of time
trying to find gambling",00:53:05.370,00:53:09.740
"strategies when to stop, when to
start betting bigger, when",00:53:09.740,00:53:15.020
"to start betting smaller, when
to do all sorts of things, all",00:53:15.020,00:53:18.460
"sorts of strategies for how
to lose less money.",00:53:18.460,00:53:23.050
"Let me put it that way, because
you rarely find that",00:53:23.050,00:53:27.520
"opportunity where you can
play a fair game.",00:53:27.520,00:53:30.890
"But if you play a fair game,
martingales are what sort of",00:53:30.890,00:53:37.450
rules on that.,00:53:37.450,00:53:38.650
"And what that says is if you
play this game for a long",00:53:38.650,00:53:42.560
"time, your capital is
Z sub n minus 1.",00:53:42.560,00:53:47.480

"No matter what strategy you use,
your expected capital is",00:53:56.790,00:54:01.640
"going to be the same as
was as the actual",00:54:01.640,00:54:05.460
capital the time before.,00:54:05.460,00:54:09.170
"If this is too abstract for you,
and it's too abstract for",00:54:09.170,00:54:14.360
"me half the time, because I look
at this, and I say, gee,",00:54:14.360,00:54:18.010
"that's not much of a
restriction, is it?",00:54:18.010,00:54:20.840
"What we're talking about is
expected values here.",00:54:20.840,00:54:24.380
"But it's more than that, because
it's saying for every",00:54:24.380,00:54:28.810
"choice of sample value for all
of these things, none of them",00:54:28.810,00:54:33.990
"make any difference, except
the last one.",00:54:33.990,00:54:37.440
"And that's what happens
in gambling.",00:54:37.440,00:54:39.970
"It doesn't make any difference
how your capital has gotten to",00:54:39.970,00:54:44.130
"the point where it is
at time n minus 1.",00:54:44.130,00:54:49.310
"You make a bet in a fair bet,
and what you win is solely a",00:54:49.310,00:54:55.880
"function of what you've bet,
if the game is fair.",00:54:55.880,00:55:01.020
"And that's what this
is saying.",00:55:01.020,00:55:02.270
"So when you write it out this
way, the expected value of Zn,",00:55:05.790,00:55:09.510
"given that 1, the random
variable Zn minus 1 has a",00:55:09.510,00:55:13.820
particular value Zn minus 1.,00:55:13.820,00:55:16.900
"You started out with
a particular value.",00:55:19.920,00:55:24.530
"It says that expected value
is equal to what you",00:55:24.530,00:55:29.520
said at the last time.,00:55:29.520,00:55:32.870
"And this is true for all sample
values Zn minus 1 down",00:55:32.870,00:55:36.170
"to Z1, which is why it's a much
stronger statement than",00:55:36.170,00:55:40.080
it appears to be.,00:55:40.080,00:55:41.330
now there's a lemma.,00:55:43.910,00:55:46.200
"I want to talk about that a
little bit, because it's a",00:55:46.200,00:55:49.250
"good time to get you
used to what these",00:55:49.250,00:55:51.500
expected values mean.,00:55:51.500,00:55:53.055
"For martingale, the expected
value of Zn given Zi, Zi minus",00:55:55.810,00:56:02.040
"1, all the way down to Z1.",00:56:02.040,00:56:04.080
"This expected value is
equal to Z sub i.",00:56:04.080,00:56:07.770
"In other words, it's not only
that your expected capital,",00:56:07.770,00:56:12.560
"given all of the past, is equal
to what you had on the",00:56:12.560,00:56:18.030
last time instant.,00:56:18.030,00:56:19.880
"If you're not given anything
for 100 years back, and all",00:56:19.880,00:56:25.830
"you know is what your capital
was 100 years ago, and if we",00:56:25.830,00:56:33.750
"think we're playing a fair game
all of this time, which",00:56:33.750,00:56:36.180
"is of course always a question,
the expected value",00:56:36.180,00:56:39.840
"of what we have now, conditional
on everything from",00:56:39.840,00:56:45.530
"100 years back through
recorded history, is",00:56:45.530,00:56:51.730
just that last term.,00:56:51.730,00:56:53.400
"In other words, it's the same
kind of isolation of the past",00:56:53.400,00:56:58.350
"from the future as we had
with Markov change.",00:56:58.350,00:57:01.790
"With Markov change, remember,
it's only what happens at one",00:57:01.790,00:57:05.260
"instant, given what happens a
one instant, it makes the past",00:57:05.260,00:57:10.990
independent of the future.,00:57:10.990,00:57:13.080
"Here it's not quite that way,
because the past and the",00:57:13.080,00:57:17.430
"future are separated only in
terms of the details of the",00:57:17.430,00:57:22.140
"past, and the expected
value the future.",00:57:22.140,00:57:27.135
"It says expected value of Z sub
n given all of the details",00:57:27.135,00:57:33.320
"of the past, no matter what the
details of the past are,",00:57:33.320,00:57:36.640

equal to the actual value at",00:57:36.640,00:57:41.340
times Z sub i.,00:57:41.340,00:57:43.440
"So I want to improve this for
you, and I warn you you're not",00:57:43.440,00:57:48.780
going to follow this proof.,00:57:48.780,00:57:50.880
"And that's part of the reason
for me to do it, because I",00:57:50.880,00:57:53.820
"want you to go back to Chapter
1 and think that through.",00:57:53.820,00:57:59.840
"Because in dealing with
martingales, you have to think",00:57:59.840,00:58:02.740
this through.,00:58:02.740,00:58:04.300
"Because if you don't think it
through, you're stuck with",00:58:04.300,00:58:07.240
"this notation all
the way through.",00:58:07.240,00:58:10.760
"And if you try to use this
notation with martingales,",00:58:10.760,00:58:14.730
"this is nice notation when you
get confused, but you don't",00:58:14.730,00:58:18.330
want to use it all the time.,00:58:18.330,00:58:19.950
"So you have to be able to go
through arguments like this.",00:58:19.950,00:58:23.500
"What I want to show is that if
E to the Z3, given Z1 and Z2",00:58:23.500,00:58:30.860
"is equal to Z2, then one special
case of this lemma is",00:58:30.860,00:58:37.390
"that expected value of Z3
given Z1 is equal to Z1.",00:58:37.390,00:58:45.370
And how do we show that?,00:58:45.370,00:58:47.480
"Well, what we do is we use this
law complete expectation.",00:58:47.480,00:58:51.930
"Well, first we remember the
expected value of an arbitrary",00:58:55.930,00:59:00.500
"random variable X is the
expected value of the expected",00:59:00.500,00:59:06.830
"value of X given Y. Now
what does that mean?",00:59:06.830,00:59:10.050
"The expected value of the random
variable X, given Y, is",00:59:10.050,00:59:17.000
a random variable.,00:59:17.000,00:59:18.990
"It's a random variable which
depends on Y. That's a",00:59:18.990,00:59:22.500
"function of the sample value of
Y. Namely, if you look at",00:59:22.500,00:59:27.250
"this quantity up here,
expected value of X",00:59:27.250,00:59:30.990
given Y equals 1.,00:59:30.990,00:59:33.290
"Expected value of X
given Y equals 2.",00:59:33.290,00:59:36.130
"Expected value of X
given Y equals 3.",00:59:36.130,00:59:38.830
"We have all of these
values here.",00:59:38.830,00:59:41.010
"We have a probability
measure on it.",00:59:41.010,00:59:43.720
"This is a random variable,
which is a function of Y.",00:59:43.720,00:59:51.150
"You've averaged that over X,
but you're left move why",00:59:51.150,00:59:54.710
"because of the conditioning
here.",00:59:54.710,00:59:56.810
"So this quantity in here is now
a function of Y. So when",00:59:56.810,01:00:04.440
"we take this equation and we
add the conditioning on Z1,",01:00:04.440,01:00:11.290

used for Z3 and Z2.",01:00:11.290,01:00:16.920

the expected value over Z2",01:00:16.920,01:00:26.910

dependent on Z1.,01:00:32.340,01:00:35.180

expected value is the expected",01:00:35.180,01:00:39.040
"value of the expected value of
Z3 condition on Z2 and Z1.",01:00:39.040,01:00:46.110
"This quantity here as
a function of what?",01:00:46.110,01:00:50.840
That's a random variable.,01:00:50.840,01:00:51.990
"It's a function of what
random variables?",01:00:51.990,01:00:55.136
"AUDIENCE: Z2, Z1.",01:00:55.136,01:00:56.540
"PROFESSOR: Z1 and Z2, yes.",01:00:56.540,01:00:59.350
"So this is a function
of Z1 and Z2.",01:00:59.350,01:01:02.380
"What value is it as a function
of Z1 and Z2?",01:01:02.380,01:01:06.220
It's just equal to Z2.,01:01:06.220,01:01:09.040
"So this quantity
in here is Z2.",01:01:09.040,01:01:12.360
"so we're asking what's expected
value of Z2 given Z1.",01:01:12.360,01:01:17.620
"And by definition of martingale,
it is equal to Z1.",01:01:17.620,01:01:23.960
"Now I imagine about half you
could follow that, and half of",01:01:27.130,01:01:30.910
"you couldn't, and half of
you sort of followed it.",01:01:30.910,01:01:35.460
"This is a kind of argument we'll
be using all the way",01:01:35.460,01:01:39.530
through on this stuff.,01:01:39.530,01:01:41.840
"So make sure you
understand it.",01:01:41.840,01:01:43.310
"I mean, once you get
it, it's easy.",01:01:45.990,01:01:49.220
"And you can apply it in
all sorts of places.",01:01:49.220,01:01:52.390
So it's worth doing it.,01:01:52.390,01:01:55.010
"In the same way, you can
follow the same kind of",01:01:55.010,01:01:57.650
"argument through the expected
value Z sub i plus 2, using",01:01:57.650,01:02:02.470
"this total expectation
based on Zi plus 1.",01:02:02.470,01:02:09.020
"And you go through
the whole thing.",01:02:09.020,01:02:11.900
"When you go down to i equals 1,
it says the expected value",01:02:11.900,01:02:17.770
"of z is equal to the expected
value of Z1.",01:02:17.770,01:02:22.330

some people put it.,01:02:37.580,01:02:40.830
"OK, let's have some simple
examples a martingales.",01:02:40.830,01:02:45.770
"One of them is a zero-mean
random walk.",01:02:45.770,01:02:49.536
"Mainly, what I'm trying to do
here is to show you this",01:02:49.536,01:02:52.370
"martingales are really pretty
general things.",01:02:52.370,01:02:56.320
"And since there are many very
general theorems that hold for",01:02:56.320,01:03:00.480
"all martingales, you can then
apply them to all of these",01:03:00.480,01:03:03.980
"special cases, which
is kind of neat.",01:03:03.980,01:03:07.640
"To have a zero-mean random walk,
let Z sub n be the sum",01:03:07.640,01:03:14.530
"of X1 plus Xn and the X sub
i's are IID and zero mean.",01:03:14.530,01:03:23.720
"The fact that they're IID
makes it a random walk.",01:03:23.720,01:03:26.710
"The fact that there's zero mean
makes it a special zero",01:03:26.710,01:03:30.060
"mean random walk, and the
expected value of Z sub n,",01:03:30.060,01:03:34.790
given Zn minus 1.,01:03:34.790,01:03:38.860
"All the way back, Zn now
is Xn plus Zn minus 1.",01:03:38.860,01:03:47.870
"OK, Zn is the sum of all
these random variables.",01:03:47.870,01:03:50.990
"So you get up n minus 1 of them,
and then you add the",01:03:50.990,01:03:54.030
last one in.,01:03:54.030,01:03:55.290
"So it's Zn minus 1 plus Xn, so
its expected value of Xn plus",01:03:55.290,01:04:07.250
"Zn minus 1, given all the
stuff before that.",01:04:07.250,01:04:12.700
"The expected value of Xn, given
all this stuff, is what?",01:04:12.700,01:04:17.160
"Xn is independent of all the
other X's, therefore it's",01:04:17.160,01:04:20.640
"independent of all
the earlier Z's.",01:04:20.640,01:04:23.760
"And therefore, that's just
expected value of Xn.",01:04:23.760,01:04:27.840
"So we have the expected value of
Zn minus 1, given Zn minus",01:04:27.840,01:04:32.740
1 back to Z1.,01:04:32.740,01:04:34.380
"What's expected value of Zn
minus 1, given Zn minus 1?",01:04:34.380,01:04:39.130
"Well, it's Zn minus 1.",01:04:39.130,01:04:42.596
That's no problem there.,01:04:42.596,01:04:44.380
So this is 0.,01:04:44.380,01:04:47.200
"So this is equal to Zn minus
1, as it's supposed to be.",01:04:47.200,01:04:53.340

to go back and think them",01:04:53.340,01:04:56.770
through yourself.,01:04:56.770,01:04:57.620
"Because the first time you look
at martingales, all of",01:04:57.620,01:05:01.120
"this stuff, it's all pretty
easy, but it all looks a",01:05:01.120,01:05:05.040
little strange at first.,01:05:05.040,01:05:07.860
"The next one is sums
of arbitrary",01:05:07.860,01:05:10.260
dependent random variables.,01:05:10.260,01:05:12.540
They're not quite arbitrary.,01:05:12.540,01:05:15.270
"Suppose you have a sequence of
random variables, X sub i, i",01:05:15.270,01:05:19.900
greater or equal to 1.,01:05:19.900,01:05:21.910
"And they satisfy the expected
value of Xi, given all the",01:05:21.910,01:05:25.970
"earlier X of i's
is equal to 0.",01:05:25.970,01:05:30.310
"It's similar to what
a martingale is.",01:05:30.310,01:05:33.060
"But here, we're just saying
the Xi's all have expected",01:05:33.060,01:05:37.350
value of 0.,01:05:37.350,01:05:39.530
"And Zn, the sum of these,
has to be a martingale.",01:05:39.530,01:05:45.350
"And I'm not going to write
all a proof of that.",01:05:45.350,01:05:48.380
"I mean, this proof is really
the same as this proof.",01:05:48.380,01:05:55.020
"This is really a pretty
important thing, because given",01:05:55.020,01:05:59.110
"any martingale, you can always
look at the partial sums",01:05:59.110,01:06:06.180
"between the terms of
the martingale--",01:06:06.180,01:06:09.370
"namely, given Z1, Z2,
up to Z sub n.",01:06:09.370,01:06:13.120
"You can always look
at Z2 minus Z1.",01:06:13.120,01:06:16.440
You can look at Z3 minus Z2.,01:06:16.440,01:06:18.970
"You could at Z4 minus
Z3, and so forth.",01:06:18.970,01:06:23.980
"And each of the Z's is
just the sum of those",01:06:23.980,01:06:26.910
other random variables.,01:06:26.910,01:06:28.380
"So given any martingale in the
world, you can always define",01:06:28.380,01:06:32.810
"the set of arbitrary depending
random variables would satisfy",01:06:32.810,01:06:37.920
this rule here.,01:06:37.920,01:06:39.970
"So Zn, in this case,
is a martingale.",01:06:39.970,01:06:45.900
"And if Zn is a martingale, you
can always define a set of",01:06:45.900,01:06:50.690
"random variables, which
satisfy this property.",01:06:50.690,01:06:55.450
"I think it's almost easier to
see what a random variable",01:06:55.450,01:06:58.920
"really has to do with gambling,
which is where it",01:06:58.920,01:07:01.430
"started, by looking at this.",01:07:01.430,01:07:05.420
"This is not your capital

or lose at time i.",01:07:08.790,01:07:13.750

winnings or losings at time i",01:07:13.750,01:07:20.270
"has zero mean independent of
everything in the past.",01:07:20.270,01:07:25.560
"In other words, in a fair game,
you can bet whatever you",01:07:25.560,01:07:28.770
"want to and depending on what
you bet, that's the expected",01:07:28.770,01:07:34.470
amount you get on that trial.,01:07:34.470,01:07:37.940
And that's what this says.,01:07:37.940,01:07:40.590
"This says essentially, you're
applying a fair game.",01:07:40.590,01:07:43.860
"So martingales really have
to do is fair games.",01:07:43.860,01:07:47.100
"If you can find fair games,
why, that's great.",01:07:47.100,01:07:50.390
"But we always look for games
where we have an edge.",01:07:50.390,01:07:54.200
"But what you want to avoid
is games where Las",01:07:54.200,01:07:56.585
Vegas has an edge.,01:07:56.585,01:07:58.630
"OK so, that's a general one.",01:07:58.630,01:08:01.800
"Here's an interesting one,
because I think this is an",01:08:04.320,01:08:10.790
example which you can use.,01:08:10.790,01:08:13.470
"I mean, in any field you
study, there are always",01:08:13.470,01:08:15.820
"generic examples, which can be
used to generate counter",01:08:15.820,01:08:20.760
"examples to any simple thing
you might want to think of.",01:08:20.760,01:08:24.899
"And this is to me the most
interesting one of those for",01:08:24.899,01:08:27.850
martingales.,01:08:27.850,01:08:29.880
"Suppose that Xi is the product
of two random variables--",01:08:29.880,01:08:34.800
"one is either plus 1 or minus 1,
each with probability 1/2.",01:08:34.800,01:08:40.890
"And the other one, Y sub i is
anything it wants to be.",01:08:40.890,01:08:44.510
I don't care what Y sub i is.,01:08:44.510,01:08:46.609
"Y sub i is non-negative, might
as well make it non-negative.",01:08:46.609,01:08:50.810
I don't care about it.,01:08:50.810,01:08:51.540
"I don't care how it's related
to all the other Y sub i's.",01:08:51.540,01:08:54.670
"All I want is the that the U sub
i's are all independent of",01:08:54.670,01:08:58.200
all the Y sub i's.,01:08:58.200,01:09:00.999
And what happens then?,01:09:00.999,01:09:03.590
"I take the expected value of X
sub i, give it anything in the",01:09:03.590,01:09:07.420
"past, and what do I get?",01:09:07.420,01:09:09.529
"U sub i is independent
of Y sub i.",01:09:12.100,01:09:15.450
"And therefore, the expected
value of U sub i times Y sub i",01:09:15.450,01:09:19.229
"is expected value of U sub
i, which is what--",01:09:19.229,01:09:24.330
"plus 1 or minus 1 of probability
1/2 each.",01:09:24.330,01:09:27.665
"The expected value of U
sub i is equal to 0.",01:09:27.665,01:09:31.880
"That makes expected value
of X sub i of 0",01:09:31.880,01:09:35.050
whatever the past is.,01:09:35.050,01:09:39.080
"So you automatically
have the--",01:09:39.080,01:09:41.716
"I don't know what to call in
them, the terms between the",01:09:46.676,01:09:49.050
terms of a martingale--,01:09:49.050,01:09:51.640
"the interarrival terms,
so to speak.",01:09:51.640,01:09:55.990
"I mean, it's like those
for a renewal process.",01:09:55.990,01:09:59.500
"Those terms always
have mean 0.",01:09:59.500,01:10:02.130
"And therefore, the sums of
these turn out to be this",01:10:02.130,01:10:08.180
simple kind of martingale.,01:10:08.180,01:10:11.000
"So that's a nice martingale to
use as counter examples for",01:10:11.000,01:10:14.910
almost anything.,01:10:14.910,01:10:17.350
"The next one is product
for martingales.",01:10:17.350,01:10:19.730
"Product for martingales are
things we use quite a bit too,",01:10:19.730,01:10:24.970
"because now when we're using
generating functions, we're in",01:10:24.970,01:10:28.240
"the habit of multiplying
things together.",01:10:28.240,01:10:31.200
"And that's a useful
thing to do.",01:10:31.200,01:10:34.320
"So the expected value of Z to
the n, given Z to the n minus",01:10:34.320,01:10:41.000
"1, now to Z1, where Zn is
this product of terms.",01:10:41.000,01:10:48.590
"OK, Z sub n then is equal to
Xn times Z sub n minus 1,",01:10:48.590,01:10:55.410
"which is what we're
doing here.",01:10:55.410,01:10:56.900
"Expected value of Zn conditional
on the past is the",01:10:56.900,01:11:01.180
"expected value of Xn times Zn
minus 1, conditional on the",01:11:01.180,01:11:06.600
"past, Xn and Zn minus 1.",01:11:06.600,01:11:13.170
"Oh, the expected value of Xn
for any given value of Zn",01:11:19.750,01:11:25.790
"minus 1, all the way back,
is just the expected",01:11:25.790,01:11:29.770
value of X sub n.,01:11:29.770,01:11:32.750
"So we have expected value of X
sub n times the expected value",01:11:32.750,01:11:36.510
"of Z sub n minus 1, given
Zn n minus 1 down to Z1.",01:11:36.510,01:11:40.970
So that's just Zn minus 1.,01:11:40.970,01:11:43.200
"Ah, the missing quantity,
fortunately I wrote it here.",01:11:46.170,01:11:51.260
"The X sub i's are unit means
random variables.",01:11:51.260,01:11:53.675
And they're IIDs.,01:11:57.990,01:11:58.880
"They're independent
of each other.",01:11:58.880,01:12:00.700
"And since the X sub i's are
independent of each other, X",01:12:00.700,01:12:05.260
"sub n is independent
of Xn minus 1, all",01:12:05.260,01:12:09.140
the way back to X1.,01:12:09.140,01:12:12.110
"Zn minus 1 back to Z1
is a function of Xn",01:12:12.110,01:12:16.080
"minus 1, down to X1.",01:12:16.080,01:12:19.140
"So Xn is independent of all
those previous Z's also.",01:12:19.140,01:12:24.090
"That's why I could split
this apart in this way.",01:12:24.090,01:12:27.560
"And suddenly I wind up with
Zn n minus 1 again.",01:12:27.560,01:12:31.350
"So product form martingales
work.",01:12:31.350,01:12:35.390
"Special form of product

"this again is favored counter
example for when you can and",01:12:39.010,01:12:44.930

going to limits and",01:12:44.930,01:12:48.530
interchanging limits.,01:12:48.530,01:12:51.040
And it's a simple one.,01:12:51.040,01:12:53.360
"Suppose that X sub i's
are IID, as in",01:12:53.360,01:12:56.740
the previous example.,01:12:56.740,01:12:59.790
"And they're [INAUDIBLE]
probably 2 or 0.",01:12:59.790,01:13:02.735
"I mean, this is a game
you often play--",01:13:09.010,01:13:12.820
double or nothing.,01:13:12.820,01:13:14.190
You start out with dollar.,01:13:14.190,01:13:15.950
You play the game.,01:13:15.950,01:13:16.890
"If you win, you get $2.",01:13:16.890,01:13:18.780
"If you lose, you're broke.",01:13:18.780,01:13:21.300
"If you win, you play your $2.",01:13:21.300,01:13:24.210

"If you lose again,
you're broke.",01:13:30.460,01:13:33.020
"So the probability that Z sub n,
which is your capital after",01:13:33.020,01:13:39.140
"n trials, is equals to 2 to the
n, namely you've won all n",01:13:39.140,01:13:43.640
"times, is 2 to the minus n.",01:13:43.640,01:13:48.540
"And every other instance
you've lost.",01:13:48.540,01:13:52.840
"So the probability that Zn is
equal to 0 is 1 minus 2",01:13:52.840,01:13:57.370
to the minus n.,01:13:57.370,01:13:59.170
"So for each n, if you calculate
the expected value",01:13:59.170,01:14:02.660
"of Z sub n, it's equal to 1.",01:14:02.660,01:14:07.420
"Namely, with probability 2 to
the minus n, your capital is 2",01:14:07.420,01:14:12.970
"to the n, so that's 1.",01:14:12.970,01:14:15.850
"With all the other probability,
you have nothing.",01:14:15.850,01:14:18.630
"So your expected value of Z sub
n is always equal to 1.",01:14:18.630,01:14:24.070
"That's what this product
form martingale says.",01:14:24.070,01:14:27.420
"And this is a product
form martingale.",01:14:27.420,01:14:29.820
"However, the limit as n goes to
infinity of Zn is equal to",01:14:29.820,01:14:36.150
0 with probability 1.,01:14:36.150,01:14:39.130
"If you play double or nothing,
eventually you lose.",01:14:39.130,01:14:43.300
And then you're wiped out.,01:14:43.300,01:14:45.920
"In other words, there's no real
purpose to playing the",01:14:45.920,01:14:47.830
"game, because eventually
you lose.",01:14:47.830,01:14:50.720
"If you're playing with somebody
else, and they're",01:14:50.720,01:14:53.620

of course you get their",01:14:53.620,01:14:56.500
money eventually.,01:14:56.500,01:14:58.530
"Or you go broke and the bank
that you bank at fails, and",01:14:58.530,01:15:02.890
all that stuff.,01:15:02.890,01:15:05.240
We won't worry about that.,01:15:05.240,01:15:06.810
"OK, but the point of this is
that the limit as n goes to",01:15:06.810,01:15:10.220
infinity of Zn is equal to 0.,01:15:10.220,01:15:13.690
"And the limit of the expected
value of Z sub",01:15:13.690,01:15:17.020
n is equal to 1.,01:15:17.020,01:15:19.920
"And therefore, the limit of Zn
and the expected value of the",01:15:19.920,01:15:24.870
limit of Zn.,01:15:24.870,01:15:26.130
"The expected value of the
limit of Zn is 0.",01:15:26.130,01:15:29.260
"The limit as expected value
of Zn is equal to one.",01:15:29.260,01:15:33.550
"So this is a case where you
can't interchange limit and",01:15:33.550,01:15:36.530
expectation.,01:15:36.530,01:15:37.920
"It's an easy one to keep in
mind, because we all know",01:15:37.920,01:15:41.690
"about playing double
or nothing.",01:15:41.690,01:15:43.740
"Might as well define
submartingales and",01:15:50.630,01:15:53.500
supermartingales.,01:15:53.500,01:15:55.540
"Because the first thing to know
about them is they're",01:15:55.540,01:16:00.800
"like martingales, except
they're defined with",01:16:00.800,01:16:03.780
inequalities.,01:16:03.780,01:16:06.220
"And for a submartingale, the
expected value of Zn, given",01:16:06.220,01:16:10.580
"all the previous terms,
is greater than or",01:16:10.580,01:16:12.970
equal to Zn minus 1.,01:16:12.970,01:16:15.560
So submartingales go up.,01:16:15.560,01:16:18.520
"Supermartingales are
the opposite.",01:16:18.520,01:16:20.630
Supermartingales goes down.,01:16:20.630,01:16:23.350

go up, go down.",01:16:27.930,01:16:29.410
"Things that should
go down, go up.",01:16:29.410,01:16:31.500
"Only thing you have to remember
about submartingales",01:16:31.500,01:16:34.110
"and supermartingales is you
figure out what terminology",01:16:34.110,01:16:39.490
"should have been used, and you
remember the terminology they",01:16:39.490,01:16:43.350
"use was the opposite of
what they should use.",01:16:43.350,01:16:45.750
"I don't know whether I've
ever seen stupider",01:16:51.520,01:16:52.980
terminology than this.,01:16:52.980,01:16:54.720
"And someone once explained the
reasoning for it, and the",01:16:54.720,01:16:57.890
reasoning was stupid too.,01:16:57.890,01:16:59.140
"So there's no excuse
for that one.",01:17:01.990,01:17:03.786
"We're only going to refer to
submartingales in what we're",01:17:08.130,01:17:11.680
"doing, partly because that's
where most of the",01:17:11.680,01:17:15.330
neat results are.,01:17:15.330,01:17:16.980
"And the other thing is if
you have to deal with a",01:17:16.980,01:17:24.920
"supermartingale, what you might
as well do is instead of",01:17:24.920,01:17:28.350
dealing with a sequence--,01:17:28.350,01:17:29.430
"Z1, Z2--",01:17:29.430,01:17:30.850
"deal with the sequence minus
Z1, minus Z2, and so forth.",01:17:30.850,01:17:35.130
"And if you change the sign on
all the terms, then you change",01:17:35.130,01:17:39.290
"supermartingales into
submartingales and vice versa.",01:17:39.290,01:17:43.840
"You don't really have to
deal with both of them.",01:17:43.840,01:17:47.510
"Let me talk briefly about an
inequality that I'm sure most",01:17:47.510,01:17:57.090
of you heard of.,01:17:57.090,01:17:58.450
"How many people have heard
of Jensen's Inequality?",01:17:58.450,01:18:00.480
"Maybe half of you,
so not everyone.",01:18:03.680,01:18:06.930
"Well, it's one of the
main work horses",01:18:06.930,01:18:10.700
of probability theory.,01:18:10.700,01:18:12.540
"Even though we haven't seen it
yet this term, you will see it",01:18:16.730,01:18:21.160
many times.,01:18:21.160,01:18:22.990
So what a convex function is.,01:18:22.990,01:18:26.680
"A convex function in simple
minded terms is something, a",01:18:26.680,01:18:31.210
convex function from r into r.,01:18:31.210,01:18:33.790
"A real value convex function
is a function which has a",01:18:33.790,01:18:40.700
"positive second derivative
everywhere.",01:18:40.700,01:18:43.250
"So it curves down and
comes back up again.",01:18:43.250,01:18:46.760
"Since you also want to talk
about functions which don't",01:18:46.760,01:18:49.730
"have second derivatives,
you want something more",01:18:49.730,01:18:53.740
general than that.,01:18:53.740,01:18:55.110
So you go from derivatives.,01:18:55.110,01:18:58.760
"You go back to your
high school ideas,",01:18:58.760,01:19:01.260
and you draw a picture.,01:19:01.260,01:19:02.900
And function is convex.,01:19:02.900,01:19:07.060
"If all the tangents to the curve
lie not strictly below,",01:19:07.060,01:19:13.660
"but all the tangents can curve
lie beneath the curve, so",01:19:13.660,01:19:17.530
"wherever you draw a tangent,
you get something which",01:19:17.530,01:19:20.800
doesn't cross the curve.,01:19:20.800,01:19:24.530
"Magnitude of X is a convex
function of X. Magnitude X as",01:19:24.530,01:19:29.550
"a function of X looks
like this.",01:19:29.550,01:19:32.120
You go down or up.,01:19:32.120,01:19:34.990
"And all tangents to this, this
goes off to infinity and this",01:19:34.990,01:19:39.740
goes off to infinity.,01:19:39.740,01:19:40.790
"So there's no way to
get something like",01:19:40.790,01:19:42.440
that in this tangent.,01:19:42.440,01:19:44.670
So you have one tangent here.,01:19:44.670,01:19:46.540
"You have a bunch of tangents
along here.",01:19:46.540,01:19:48.870
"And you have one
tangent there.",01:19:48.870,01:19:50.810
"And they all lie below
the curve.",01:19:50.810,01:19:52.840
"So X bar is a convex
function too.",01:19:52.840,01:19:56.320
"And Jensen's Inequality says if
H is convex, and if Z is a",01:19:56.320,01:20:02.390

expectation, then H of the",01:20:02.390,01:20:07.970

interchange expected value and",01:20:12.470,01:20:16.960

like this, if",01:20:16.960,01:20:21.020
the function is convex.,01:20:21.020,01:20:23.770
"Now, why is this true?",01:20:23.770,01:20:25.180

automatically, if you're",01:20:29.430,01:20:33.950

that has only two values.",01:20:33.950,01:20:38.600
"If you have two values for
the random variable--",01:20:38.600,01:20:45.600
Z is a random variable here.,01:20:45.600,01:20:47.680
"You have one variable here,
one value here, one sample",01:20:47.680,01:20:51.630
value here.,01:20:51.630,01:20:53.660
"Look at what the expected
value of H of Z is.",01:20:53.660,01:21:00.130
"The expected value of H of Z is
the expected value of this",01:21:00.130,01:21:06.640

probability put in on it, so",01:21:06.640,01:21:10.173

on the straight line",01:21:10.173,01:21:12.770
between here and there.,01:21:12.770,01:21:15.990

"find the expected value
along here.",01:21:21.910,01:21:24.340
"You can think of finding it
along the straight line here.",01:21:24.340,01:21:27.200
"And then it's that
point there.",01:21:27.200,01:21:29.960
"So since the curve is convex,
the H of the expected value of",01:21:29.960,01:21:40.500
"Z is there's always
a bunch of points.",01:21:40.500,01:21:43.870

directly along the curve.,01:21:51.270,01:21:53.220
"So you get this boosting
up everywhere.",01:21:53.220,01:21:56.280

"we had a lot of new
things today.",01:22:22.242,01:22:24.410
