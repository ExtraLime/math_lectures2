LINAN CHEN: Hi.,00:00:07.025,00:00:07.650
Welcome back to recitation.,00:00:07.650,00:00:09.790
"In the lecture, you've learned
eigenvalues and eigenvectors",00:00:09.790,00:00:12.960
of a matrix.,00:00:12.960,00:00:14.170
"One of the many important
applications of them",00:00:14.170,00:00:17.250
"is solving a higher-order
linear differential equation",00:00:17.250,00:00:20.720
with constant coefficients.,00:00:20.720,00:00:22.760
"A typical example is like what
I've written on the board here.",00:00:22.760,00:00:27.340
"y is a function of t,
and y and its derivatives",00:00:27.340,00:00:32.250
satisfy this equation.,00:00:32.250,00:00:34.510
"As you can see, it involves
y, y prime, and all the way",00:00:34.510,00:00:38.830
to its third derivative.,00:00:38.830,00:00:41.370
"So our first goal is to solve
this differential equation",00:00:41.370,00:00:45.700
"for its general solution
using the method of matrix.",00:00:45.700,00:00:50.440
"So the very first
thing that we should do",00:00:50.440,00:00:52.830
"is to find out which matrix
we should be working with.",00:00:52.830,00:00:56.640
"So after that, we also
want to say something about",00:00:56.640,00:01:01.380
"the explanation of
this matrix A*t.",00:01:01.380,00:01:05.030
"We want to find out the
first column of this matrix",00:01:05.030,00:01:08.570
exponential.,00:01:08.570,00:01:10.750
"Why don't you hit the pause
now, and try to write down",00:01:10.750,00:01:13.940
this matrix A by yourself.,00:01:13.940,00:01:16.420
"But before you continue,
make sure you come back",00:01:16.420,00:01:19.270
"to this video and
check with me you've",00:01:19.270,00:01:21.370
"got the correct A. I'll
see you in a while.",00:01:21.370,00:01:23.850
"OK, let's work together
to transform this problem",00:01:33.940,00:01:37.950
into linear algebra.,00:01:37.950,00:01:40.220
"The idea is to put
y double prime,",00:01:40.220,00:01:48.770
"y prime, and y
together as a vector.",00:01:48.770,00:01:55.560
And let me call this vector u.,00:01:55.560,00:01:58.180
"So of course, vector u
is also a function in t.",00:01:58.180,00:02:07.420
So this is vector u.,00:02:07.420,00:02:09.720
"If this is u, what's
going to be u prime?",00:02:09.720,00:02:12.790
"OK, u prime is going to
be-- so I take derivative",00:02:12.790,00:02:18.350
"of every coordinate here that's
going to be y triple prime,",00:02:18.350,00:02:23.930
"y double prime, and y prime.",00:02:23.930,00:02:27.170
So this is our u prime t.,00:02:27.170,00:02:31.580
"And my goal is to write
u prime as a matrix,",00:02:34.210,00:02:40.670
"call it A, times
vector u itself.",00:02:40.670,00:02:46.710
So I want to put a matrix here.,00:02:46.710,00:02:49.090
"And I want to create this
matrix by incorporating",00:02:52.720,00:02:56.660
this differential equation.,00:02:56.660,00:02:59.170
"If you move everything
except y triple prime",00:02:59.170,00:03:02.590
"to the right-hand
side of the equation,",00:03:02.590,00:03:05.060
"you can read y triple prime
is equal to negative 2 times",00:03:05.060,00:03:10.290
"y double prime-- so y
triple prime is negative",00:03:10.290,00:03:14.240
"2 times y double prime--
plus y prime-- that's",00:03:14.240,00:03:19.960
plus 1 times y prime-- plus 2y.,00:03:19.960,00:03:24.550
"That's 2y, right?",00:03:24.550,00:03:28.440
That gives you the first row.,00:03:28.440,00:03:30.770
"Then look at the
second coordinate,",00:03:30.770,00:03:33.270
this y double prime.,00:03:33.270,00:03:34.970
y double prime is simply itself.,00:03:34.970,00:03:37.470
"So you read y double prime is
equal to 1 y double prime, then",00:03:37.470,00:03:43.260
"0, 0.",00:03:43.260,00:03:45.650
That's the second row.,00:03:45.650,00:03:46.820
"Well, same thing
happens to the last row.",00:03:46.820,00:03:49.850
y prime is again itself.,00:03:49.850,00:03:52.390
"So that's 0, 1, and 0.",00:03:52.390,00:03:58.660
"That is our matrix A. Did
you get the right answer?",00:03:58.660,00:04:03.680
"So we have transformed
this equation,",00:04:03.680,00:04:07.160
"this third-order ordinary
differential equation of y",00:04:07.160,00:04:11.770
"into a first-order
differential equation of u(t).",00:04:11.770,00:04:16.540
"Although u(t) is a
vector, but if we",00:04:16.540,00:04:19.480
"can solve this
equation for u, we",00:04:19.480,00:04:22.000
"have all the information
we need for y.",00:04:22.000,00:04:25.380
"So let's plan on
solving this equation.",00:04:25.380,00:04:30.490
"In order to solve
this equation, we",00:04:30.490,00:04:32.855
"will need the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of this matrix A.",00:04:32.855,00:04:38.240
"Again, this is a good
practice for you.",00:04:38.240,00:04:40.930
"Why don't you pause
the video again,",00:04:40.930,00:04:43.220
"and try to complete this
problem on your own.",00:04:43.220,00:04:46.330
"When you're ready, I'm going
to come back and show you",00:04:46.330,00:04:48.970
how I did it.,00:04:48.970,00:04:49.820
"Let's finish up
everything together.",00:05:01.170,00:05:03.520
"So as we said, we need the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors",00:05:03.520,00:05:07.540
"of matrix A, and that involves
computing the determinant",00:05:07.540,00:05:13.395
of the following matrix.,00:05:13.395,00:05:15.660
"So I want to compute the
determinant of A minus lambda",00:05:15.660,00:05:20.540
times the identity matrix I.,00:05:20.540,00:05:23.550
Let's write it out.,00:05:23.550,00:05:25.180
"That's the determinant
of -2 minus lambda, 1 2;",00:05:25.180,00:05:36.060
"1, negative lambda, 0;
and 0, 1, negative lambda.",00:05:36.060,00:05:42.540
"So we need the determinant of
this three by three matrix.",00:05:45.850,00:05:50.290
Do it in your favorite way.,00:05:50.290,00:05:52.220
"You can either use the
big summation formula,",00:05:52.220,00:05:55.570
"or you can do by cofactor
along any row or any column.",00:05:55.570,00:06:00.710
"The correct answer
should be this",00:06:00.710,00:06:04.140
"is equal to 1 minus
lambda times 1 plus lambda",00:06:04.140,00:06:10.570
times 2 plus lambda.,00:06:10.570,00:06:11.900
"And this polynomial has
three roots: 1, -1, and -2.",00:06:14.830,00:06:21.790
"These are the eigenvalues
we're looking for.",00:06:21.790,00:06:24.380
So let me write it here.,00:06:24.380,00:06:26.240
Lambda_1 is equal to 1.,00:06:26.240,00:06:30.700
Lambda_2 is equal to -1.,00:06:30.700,00:06:34.990
And lambda_3 is equal to -2.,00:06:34.990,00:06:42.970
"So now what we need is the
eigenvector corresponding",00:06:42.970,00:06:47.040
to each eigenvalue.,00:06:47.040,00:06:49.620
Let's take lambda_1 for example.,00:06:49.620,00:06:52.820
"The eigenvector of A
corresponding to lambda_1 is",00:06:52.820,00:06:57.130
"in the null space of the
matrix A minus lambda_1*I,",00:06:57.130,00:07:02.390
"so in this case it's A minus
I. So it's in the null space",00:07:02.390,00:07:07.230
of this matrix.,00:07:07.230,00:07:08.870
"In other words, we are
looking for a vector,",00:07:08.870,00:07:12.360
"let's call it [a, b, c], a
column vector a, b, and c, such",00:07:12.360,00:07:18.600
"that this matrix multiplying
[a,  b, c] gives me 0.",00:07:18.600,00:07:23.560
"So if you write it
out, that's going",00:07:23.560,00:07:25.960
"to be A minus I is
[-3, 1, 2; 1,  -1, 0; 0, 1, -1]",00:07:25.960,00:07:39.150
times [a; b; c] is equal to 0.,00:07:39.150,00:07:44.175
OK.,00:07:46.960,00:07:47.460
"Could we choose
constants a, b, c",00:07:47.460,00:07:50.340
such that this is always true?,00:07:50.340,00:07:53.360
"Well if you read the last
row, so the last dot product,",00:07:53.360,00:07:58.390
"it says that b has
to be equal to c.",00:07:58.390,00:08:04.030
"And if you read the
second row it says",00:08:04.030,00:08:07.090
that a has to be equal to b.,00:08:07.090,00:08:09.690
"Which means a is equal
to b is equal to c.",00:08:12.460,00:08:16.750
"And if this relation is
true, the first product",00:08:16.750,00:08:20.140
is always going to be 0.,00:08:20.140,00:08:23.170
"So that simply
means we can choose",00:08:23.170,00:08:26.770
"the first eigenvector,
the eigenvector",00:08:26.770,00:08:29.780
"corresponding to
lambda_1, to be x_1 is",00:08:29.780,00:08:34.690
"equal to [1, 1, 1] transpose.",00:08:34.690,00:08:41.100
"So we choose the
first eigenvector",00:08:41.100,00:08:43.760
"to be the column vector with
all the coordinates being 1.",00:08:43.760,00:08:50.290
"And you can do the same thing
to lambda_2 and lambda_3.",00:08:50.290,00:08:55.370
"But please allow me to
skip the computation here.",00:08:55.370,00:08:58.600
"I'm going to write out
the answer for you.",00:08:58.600,00:09:00.900
"So x_2 the eigenvector
corresponding",00:09:00.900,00:09:06.040
"to the second
eigenvalue, is going",00:09:06.040,00:09:08.340
"to be equal to 1, -1, and 1.",00:09:08.340,00:09:13.630
"And x_3 is going
to be 4, -2, and 1.",00:09:13.630,00:09:23.190
"Now we've got everything
we need in order",00:09:23.190,00:09:26.030
"to create the general
solutions for u(t)",00:09:26.030,00:09:30.130
"So we have eigenvalues, we have
the corresponding eigenvectors.",00:09:30.130,00:09:34.720
What should be u(t)?,00:09:34.720,00:09:36.660
"The general solution for u(t)
is equal to some constant C_1",00:09:36.660,00:09:45.550
"times e to the power
lambda_1*t-- so in this case,",00:09:45.550,00:09:49.280
e to the power t.,00:09:49.280,00:09:50.890
"Then times the first
eigenvector, x_1.",00:09:50.890,00:09:56.250
"Plus some other constant
C_2 times e to the power",00:09:56.250,00:10:01.160
lambda_2*t--,00:10:01.160,00:10:02.140
"so e to the power
negative t-- times x_2.",00:10:02.140,00:10:07.750
That's the second eigenvector.,00:10:07.750,00:10:09.840
"Then plus some other constant,
C_3 times e to the power",00:10:09.840,00:10:16.870
"lambda_3t-- so negative
2t-- times x_3.",00:10:16.870,00:10:22.190
"That gives you the
general solution for u.",00:10:22.190,00:10:25.740
"As we just said, if
you know what u is,",00:10:25.740,00:10:29.080
"you have all the
information you need for y.",00:10:29.080,00:10:33.030
"Just in case you're
curious about what y is,",00:10:33.030,00:10:36.340
"you can just read
the last coordinate",00:10:36.340,00:10:38.850
"of x_1, x_2, and x_3.",00:10:38.850,00:10:43.160
"And you can see that
all of them are 1.",00:10:43.160,00:10:46.920
"So y(t) is simply equal to C_1
e to the power lambda t plus C_2",00:10:46.920,00:10:57.986
"e to the power negative t plus
C_3 e to the power negative 2t.",00:10:57.986,00:11:06.290
"And the choice of C_1, C_2, and
C_3 is completely arbitrary.",00:11:06.290,00:11:12.300
"So that completes the first
part of this question.",00:11:12.300,00:11:16.030
"In the second part, we
want to say something about",00:11:16.030,00:11:19.490
the exponential of A*t.,00:11:19.490,00:11:21.840
"So let me first give you
the recipe to cook up",00:11:21.840,00:11:25.180
the exponential of A*t.,00:11:25.180,00:11:28.680
"The exponential of A*t is
equal to the product of three",00:11:28.680,00:11:36.320
matrices.,00:11:36.320,00:11:38.050
"So you usually we
denote them by S times e",00:11:38.050,00:11:42.990
"to the power capital
lambda t times S inverse.",00:11:42.990,00:11:49.140
"And you may ask what S is,
and what this matrix is.",00:11:49.140,00:11:53.320
"So S is the matrix that has x_1,
x_2, and x_3 being its column",00:11:53.320,00:12:00.370
vectors.,00:12:00.370,00:12:01.560
"So S is x_1, x_2, and x_3.",00:12:01.560,00:12:09.270
Let me copy it down here.,00:12:09.270,00:12:11.600
"So that's 1, 1, 1;
1 -1, 1; 4, -2, 1.",00:12:11.600,00:12:19.870
"And the matrix in the middle,
e to the power lambda*t is",00:12:22.460,00:12:26.780
a diagonal matrix.,00:12:26.780,00:12:28.610
"So e to the power lambda*t,
it's a diagonal matrix,",00:12:28.610,00:12:34.060
"and its diagonal entries
are given by e to the power",00:12:34.060,00:12:39.300
"lambda_1*t-- so that's
e to the power t--",00:12:39.300,00:12:42.532
"then e to the power
lambda_2*t-- negative t--",00:12:42.532,00:12:45.770
"and e to the power
lambda_3*t-- negative 2t.",00:12:45.770,00:12:48.330
0 everywhere else.,00:12:51.490,00:12:53.190
"So that's e to the
power lambda*t.",00:12:53.190,00:12:55.850
"Then the exponential
of this At is",00:12:55.850,00:12:58.860
"given by the product of
these three matrices.",00:12:58.860,00:13:02.490
"It looks a bit complicated
because it involves",00:13:02.490,00:13:05.310
"the inverse of S.
But luckily, we only",00:13:05.310,00:13:09.010
"want the first
column of the result.",00:13:09.010,00:13:12.400
"So if we consider this
product, we can see:",00:13:12.400,00:13:22.710
"the product of the
first two matrices",00:13:22.710,00:13:25.370
"is relatively easy, because
this is a diagonal matrix,",00:13:25.370,00:13:30.220
"and we know that S is
given by these columns.",00:13:30.220,00:13:33.730
"So the result of the
product of these two",00:13:33.730,00:13:36.510
"is simply multiplying
the columns",00:13:36.510,00:13:39.130
"of S by these
coefficients respectively.",00:13:39.130,00:13:44.220
"So you expect to get e
to the power lambda_t",00:13:44.220,00:13:47.610
"x_1 times e to
the power-- sorry.",00:13:47.610,00:13:52.230
"The second column should be e
to the power negative t, x_2.",00:13:52.230,00:13:56.220
"The third column should be e
to the power negative 2t, x_3.",00:13:56.220,00:13:59.556
"And here, what we
should put is S inverse.",00:14:02.870,00:14:07.570
"But we don't need
everything from S inverse,",00:14:07.570,00:14:10.680
"because as we just
said, we only need",00:14:10.680,00:14:13.770
"the first column of this
result. And the first column",00:14:13.770,00:14:17.660
"of this product is
going to be given",00:14:17.660,00:14:20.050
"by linear combinations
of these columns,",00:14:20.050,00:14:23.940
"and the coefficients are going
to be given by the first column",00:14:23.940,00:14:27.790
S inverse.,00:14:27.790,00:14:29.430
"So our goal should
be just to get",00:14:29.430,00:14:32.720
the first column of S inverse.,00:14:32.720,00:14:37.320
"Then what is the first
column of S inverse?",00:14:37.320,00:14:40.290
"Well, the formula
for S inverse is",00:14:40.290,00:14:44.040
"S inverse is going to be the
reciprocal of the determinant",00:14:44.040,00:14:47.510
"of S, so 1 over
determinant of S,",00:14:47.510,00:14:50.770
"times the transpose of a
matrix C. This matrix C,",00:14:50.770,00:14:57.130
"the entries of this matrix C are
given by cofactors of matrix S.",00:14:57.130,00:15:02.680
"And then you take transpose,
you divide everything",00:15:02.680,00:15:05.660
"by the determinant of S. The
result will be S inverse.",00:15:05.660,00:15:11.270
"And we only need the first
column of this matrix.",00:15:11.270,00:15:15.700
"Let's try to write
the first column out.",00:15:15.700,00:15:18.220
"Well again, do it
in your favorite way",00:15:18.220,00:15:20.930
"to compute the determinant of S.
The result should be 1 over 6.",00:15:20.930,00:15:25.830
So the determinant of S is 6.,00:15:25.830,00:15:28.650
"Then what is the first
column of C transpose?",00:15:28.650,00:15:32.080
Well we can read it from here.,00:15:32.080,00:15:37.360
"This spot, the (1,
1) spot, should be",00:15:37.360,00:15:40.600
the cofactor of this spot here.,00:15:40.600,00:15:44.560
"That negative 1 minus
negative 2, which is 1,",00:15:44.560,00:15:49.800
so we put 1 here.,00:15:49.800,00:15:51.390
"Now this spot will be the
cofactor of this entry here.",00:15:55.230,00:16:03.660
"so that's 1 minus
negative 2, that's 3.",00:16:03.660,00:16:08.390
"But this is (1, 2) entry, so
you should put a negative sign",00:16:08.390,00:16:11.940
in the front.,00:16:11.940,00:16:12.700
"Then the last spot should be
the cofactor of this entry here,",00:16:16.850,00:16:22.590
"which is 1 minus
negative 1, that's 2.",00:16:22.590,00:16:26.520
Something else here.,00:16:29.220,00:16:30.360
Two warnings.,00:16:34.240,00:16:35.710
"First, don't forget
this transpose sign.",00:16:35.710,00:16:39.700
"Second, don't forget
this negative sign.",00:16:39.700,00:16:44.430
"We've got the first
column of S inverse,",00:16:44.430,00:16:47.360
and that's all we need.,00:16:47.360,00:16:49.320
So we put it here.,00:16:49.320,00:16:50.720
"That's 1 over 6, -1/2, and 1/3.",00:16:50.720,00:16:57.780
That's good enough for me.,00:17:02.750,00:17:04.210
"Now I can read out the first
column of exponential of A*t.",00:17:04.210,00:17:08.700
"So the first column of
the exponential of A*t,",00:17:08.700,00:17:13.050
I'm going to write it here.,00:17:13.050,00:17:16.060
"That's going to be equal
to the linear combination",00:17:16.060,00:17:20.690
of these columns.,00:17:20.690,00:17:21.990
"So that's 1/6 of
the first column,",00:17:21.990,00:17:25.154
"that's e to the power
t over 6 times x_1.",00:17:25.154,00:17:30.580
"Plus this times this, so that's
going to be minus 1/2 of e",00:17:30.580,00:17:37.700
"to the power
negative t times x_2.",00:17:37.700,00:17:42.040
"Then plus 1/3 of e to the
power negative 2t times x_3.",00:17:42.040,00:17:50.660
"That's the first column
of the exponential A*t.",00:17:50.660,00:17:53.940
"And then with the
other two columns.",00:17:53.940,00:17:55.980
That's the answer.,00:18:00.750,00:18:02.520
"If you want more practice, you
can certainly complete this S",00:18:02.520,00:18:07.740
"inverse, and then you can
also complete the exponential",00:18:07.740,00:18:11.720
of A*t.,00:18:11.720,00:18:13.280
"But I will leave
the rest to you.",00:18:13.280,00:18:16.360
"OK, I hope this
example shows you",00:18:16.360,00:18:19.120
"that linear algebra can be
a powerful tool in solving",00:18:19.120,00:18:23.160
"higher-order ordinary
differential equations",00:18:23.160,00:18:25.760
with constant coefficients.,00:18:25.760,00:18:27.890
"And we have demonstrated the
standard procedure to do it,",00:18:27.890,00:18:32.110
"and we also practiced
how to calculate",00:18:32.110,00:18:34.720
the exponential of a matrix.,00:18:34.720,00:18:37.140
"Thanks for watching,
and see you next time.",00:18:37.140,00:18:40.140
