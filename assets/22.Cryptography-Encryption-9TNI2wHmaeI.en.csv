SRINIVAS DEVADAS: All right.,00:00:20.364,00:00:21.530
"Good morning, everyone.",00:00:21.530,00:00:23.860
"So more of the same in terms of
cryptography and cryptographic",00:00:23.860,00:00:29.780
"techniques similar
to Tuesday's lecture.",00:00:29.780,00:00:32.750
"So if you liked it,
you'll like this one.",00:00:32.750,00:00:35.430
"If you didn't like
it, well, it's",00:00:35.430,00:00:37.180
"going to be more of
the same, so sorry.",00:00:37.180,00:00:41.020
"But what we're
going to do today is",00:00:41.020,00:00:44.340
"do a couple of things a
little bit differently.",00:00:44.340,00:00:47.840
"We're going to talk
about encryption.",00:00:47.840,00:00:49.760
"So we talked about
hashing, which, of course,",00:00:49.760,00:00:51.660
"you know about from the
use of dictionaries.",00:00:51.660,00:00:55.150
"We haven't really talked about
encryption in 046 or even",00:00:55.150,00:00:58.770
in 006 previously.,00:00:58.770,00:01:02.770
"But we look at two different
kinds of encryption algorithms.",00:01:02.770,00:01:07.940
"We spend a little bit of time
on symmetric key encryption,",00:01:07.940,00:01:11.950
"which is really something that
was used in encoding machines",00:01:11.950,00:01:15.310
"including the enigma from World
War II that you probably saw",00:01:15.310,00:01:21.180
if you saw The Imitation Game.,00:01:21.180,00:01:23.190
"So there you have
a shared secret.",00:01:23.190,00:01:26.410
"And it's that single,
what's called,",00:01:26.410,00:01:28.560
symmetric shared secret.,00:01:28.560,00:01:29.910
Both parties know the secret.,00:01:29.910,00:01:32.320
"And very quickly, we'll
talk about what it means",00:01:32.320,00:01:37.570
to actually exchange a secret.,00:01:37.570,00:01:39.620
"So we'll talk
about key exchange.",00:01:39.620,00:01:41.360
"And then I'll move to
asymmetric key encryption, which",00:01:41.360,00:01:45.350
"I alluded to a
little bit when we",00:01:45.350,00:01:47.240
"talked about digital
signatures last time.",00:01:47.240,00:01:49.520
"I talked about public
keys and private keys.",00:01:49.520,00:01:51.860
"But we're going to
actually look at a couple",00:01:51.860,00:01:53.700
"of different public key
encryption algorithms today.",00:01:53.700,00:01:56.840
"The classical algorithm, the
very first algorithm really",00:01:56.840,00:02:00.650
"that stayed secure,
the RSA algorithm.",00:02:00.650,00:02:04.520
"It stands for Rivest,
Shamir, and Adleman,",00:02:04.520,00:02:07.270
"the initials of the
three inventors,",00:02:07.270,00:02:09.139
"invented at MIT in 1977
and still in use today.",00:02:09.139,00:02:14.990
"And the last part
of today's lecture",00:02:14.990,00:02:17.410
"is going to be
looking at hardness.",00:02:17.410,00:02:21.220
"So in encryption, if you
don't know the secret key,",00:02:21.220,00:02:25.840
"it should be hard
for an adversary",00:02:25.840,00:02:28.830
"to discover what the
message corresponds to.",00:02:28.830,00:02:33.040
"The adversary sees what's
called the cipher text, which",00:02:33.040,00:02:36.040
is the encrypted text.,00:02:36.040,00:02:38.270
"The adversary does not
know the secret key.",00:02:38.270,00:02:40.890
"If he or she knows the
secret key, game over.",00:02:40.890,00:02:43.990
"But assuming that adversary
does not know the secret key,",00:02:43.990,00:02:47.280
"it should be computational hard
to discover the message, right?",00:02:47.280,00:02:51.810
That makes sense.,00:02:51.810,00:02:53.340
"So there's clearly
a relationship",00:02:53.340,00:02:55.510
"between this hardness
and NP-complete problems,",00:02:55.510,00:02:59.840
which are computationally hard.,00:02:59.840,00:03:01.930
"And it's not
surprising that people",00:03:01.930,00:03:04.520
"have tried to build what are
called cryptosystems, which",00:03:04.520,00:03:08.230
"are essentially cryptographic
techniques, based",00:03:08.230,00:03:10.830
"on the hardness of
NP-complete problems,",00:03:10.830,00:03:13.540
"including graph
coloring and knapsack",00:03:13.540,00:03:15.430
and so on and so forth.,00:03:15.430,00:03:16.810
"But it turns out there's
a real subtle difference",00:03:16.810,00:03:21.260
"between the kinds of problems
that have been useful in terms",00:03:21.260,00:03:28.520
"of building secure
cryptosystems like RSA",00:03:28.520,00:03:31.490
and NP-complete problems.,00:03:31.490,00:03:33.320
"And we'll talk about that
at the end of lecture.",00:03:33.320,00:03:36.140
"We'll probably spend a
bunch of time on that.",00:03:36.140,00:03:38.960
"So let's get started with the
symmetric key encryption, which",00:03:38.960,00:03:43.230
"is, at some level,
kind of boring",00:03:43.230,00:03:45.130
from a mathematical standpoint.,00:03:45.130,00:03:46.870
"So we want to spend
a lot of time on it.",00:03:46.870,00:03:49.380
It's definitely very useful.,00:03:49.380,00:03:51.520
"It essentially assumes that
there's a secret key k.",00:03:51.520,00:03:57.280
"And you can think of
this as a 128-bit number.",00:03:57.280,00:04:00.760
"Some people want it
to be larger, 256.",00:04:00.760,00:04:04.280
But it's suddenly at 64.,00:04:04.280,00:04:06.670
"At this point, it's
probably not enough,",00:04:06.670,00:04:09.960
"even though 2 raised to 64 is
still a fairly large number.",00:04:09.960,00:04:13.380
"With parallelism and
with fast computers,",00:04:13.380,00:04:18.700
"it's a little worrisome
that the adversary only",00:04:18.700,00:04:22.250
"requires 2 raised to
64 work to enumerate",00:04:22.250,00:04:25.820
"all possible secret
keys of 64-bits right?",00:04:25.820,00:04:30.160
"So 122 raised to
128 is much better.",00:04:30.160,00:04:33.910
"And this is shared
between Alice and Bob.",00:04:33.910,00:04:37.830
"So we'll think about
the protagonists",00:04:37.830,00:04:41.330
here as being Alice and Bob.,00:04:41.330,00:04:44.420
"And they want to
exchange information.",00:04:44.420,00:04:47.440
"And typically, the adversary
is mal for malicious.",00:04:47.440,00:04:51.770
"But there's other ways you can
obviously name adversaries.",00:04:54.770,00:04:58.565
"So the basic equation here
is really straightforward.",00:05:01.080,00:05:05.120
"It's C, which is
the cipher text.",00:05:05.120,00:05:08.310
"So a little terminology
here, cipher text.",00:05:08.310,00:05:12.880
"m is the plain text
or the message.",00:05:12.880,00:05:16.175
"And plain text means
you can just read it.",00:05:19.100,00:05:21.240
"Cipher text means
it's scrambled.",00:05:21.240,00:05:23.870
"K is, of course, the
secret key that's up here.",00:05:23.870,00:05:29.130
"And the e is the
encryption function.",00:05:29.130,00:05:31.130
"Now, in symmetric
key cryptography,",00:05:37.680,00:05:40.680
"basically the
requirement is that you",00:05:40.680,00:05:44.450
"have to be able to get back
the plain text from the cipher",00:05:44.450,00:05:49.390
"text given a public decryption
function and knowledge",00:05:49.390,00:05:54.690
of the secret key.,00:05:54.690,00:05:55.930
"And this should be a
straightforward operation,",00:05:55.930,00:05:58.110
right?,00:05:58.110,00:05:58.780
"So by the way, e of k m, this
is a polytime computation.",00:05:58.780,00:06:04.640
It's not constant time.,00:06:04.640,00:06:06.410
It's typically linear time.,00:06:06.410,00:06:08.140
"And you don't really want it
to be quadratic time even,",00:06:08.140,00:06:11.980
"because you want to do
this vary fast, streaming.",00:06:11.980,00:06:15.340
"You need to send
streams of messages,",00:06:15.340,00:06:18.000
"many gigabytes potentially,
that are all encrypted.",00:06:18.000,00:06:21.180
"And this is actually
what happens",00:06:21.180,00:06:22.560
"when you get stuff
from your satellite",00:06:22.560,00:06:24.700
and you're downloading movies.,00:06:24.700,00:06:26.380
That's exactly what happens.,00:06:26.380,00:06:28.350
"It's symmetric key
encryption of a lot of data.",00:06:28.350,00:06:31.670
So backwards would be dk c.,00:06:31.670,00:06:36.554
"And the only difference
here is that everything else",00:06:36.554,00:06:38.720
stays the same.,00:06:38.720,00:06:39.960
This is our decryption function.,00:06:39.960,00:06:41.440
All right.,00:06:44.980,00:06:46.690
"So that's symmetric
encryption is.",00:06:46.690,00:06:50.630
"And there's a requirement
of reversibility here.",00:06:50.630,00:06:54.100
"So it's a lot different
from one way hashes",00:06:54.100,00:06:57.590
that we talked about last time.,00:06:57.590,00:06:59.340
"Because here, while you want
going from c to m to be hard,",00:06:59.340,00:07:06.800
"it's only hard if the
adversary doesn't know k.",00:07:06.800,00:07:11.990
"If anybody knows k,
it should be easy.",00:07:11.990,00:07:14.490
"In fact, that e and
d are going to be",00:07:14.490,00:07:18.030
"virtually identical
in terms of complexity",00:07:18.030,00:07:21.770
and sometimes implementation.,00:07:21.770,00:07:23.850
"It's just you run it in
reverse, and you get back",00:07:23.850,00:07:27.300
what you encrypted.,00:07:27.300,00:07:29.040
"That's the way you
want to think about it.",00:07:29.040,00:07:30.960
"So really what happens is that
you need reversible operations",00:07:30.960,00:07:37.340
"in order to build e or d,
which are the encryption",00:07:37.340,00:07:45.030
and the decryption functions.,00:07:45.030,00:07:46.840
"So permutation, for
example, is reversible.",00:07:46.840,00:07:50.440
"You can always take
something and permute it,",00:07:50.440,00:07:52.520
and you can go backwards.,00:07:52.520,00:07:54.660
"So you could do
something like that.",00:07:54.660,00:07:57.390
"And the permutation, the
reverse, looks like that.",00:07:57.390,00:08:01.530
What is this supposed to be?,00:08:01.530,00:08:03.800
"It's the fact that
I have 3 bits here.",00:08:03.800,00:08:07.350
"And they turn into
3 bits over there.",00:08:07.350,00:08:12.300
"And obviously, if I
reverse the permutation",00:08:12.300,00:08:16.265
"and if I just add a simple
thing where it was abc",00:08:16.265,00:08:19.220
"and I'm going to
convert it to cba,",00:08:19.220,00:08:21.190
"then cba can go
back to abc through",00:08:21.190,00:08:23.830
the reverse permutation.,00:08:23.830,00:08:25.060
"So clearly, this is a
reversible operation.",00:08:25.060,00:08:27.660
"But there are other operations
that are reversible as well.",00:08:27.660,00:08:30.330
"Plus can be reversed
by a negation.",00:08:30.330,00:08:35.840
"And exclusive OR is
simply exclusive OR.",00:08:35.840,00:08:39.580
"Because if you do A exclusive
OR B, then you get C.",00:08:39.580,00:08:45.905
"And imagine if you did B
again to that, you get A back.",00:08:45.905,00:08:50.590
That's what I mean by reversal.,00:08:50.590,00:08:52.230
"Because you have, essentially,
A exclusive OR A cancels out.",00:08:52.230,00:08:56.240
"And so it's something like a
exclusive OR B exclusive OR B",00:08:56.240,00:09:00.780
again would give you A.,00:09:00.780,00:09:04.330
"So if you go look at AES, for
example, which is the Advanced",00:09:04.330,00:09:09.110
"Encryption Standard, is really
only about four lines of code,",00:09:09.110,00:09:12.430
maybe it's eight lines of code.,00:09:12.430,00:09:14.380
"But this is a well
used, it has been around",00:09:14.380,00:09:18.520
"for a while, symmetric
key cipher that",00:09:18.520,00:09:22.670
"runs in 128-bit mode as
well as 256-bit mode.",00:09:22.670,00:09:27.020
"And it's, like I said,
a few lines of code.",00:09:27.020,00:09:30.410
"And you'll see operations
like this, permutations.",00:09:30.410,00:09:34.370
"And you'll see hat symbols
if you see a C program, which",00:09:34.370,00:09:37.720
is exclusive OR.,00:09:37.720,00:09:39.140
"And you can see the
encryption and the decryption",00:09:39.140,00:09:42.260
are identical in implementation.,00:09:42.260,00:09:43.840
"You're just going to run it
one way, and you run it again.",00:09:43.840,00:09:46.500
"And you get back the result.
Because these permutations",00:09:46.500,00:09:49.040
are reversible.,00:09:49.040,00:09:50.060
And the hats are reversible.,00:09:50.060,00:09:52.080
"And they're all signed
integers, so you're just",00:09:52.080,00:09:54.880
sort of adding them up.,00:09:54.880,00:09:55.940
"And it's just
complement arithmetic,",00:09:55.940,00:09:58.220
so that looks the same as well.,00:09:58.220,00:10:00.140
"So I encourage you to
go take a look at AES.",00:10:00.140,00:10:02.440
"I'm not going to
spend more time on it.",00:10:02.440,00:10:04.500
"The key idea here is of
symmetry and reversibility.",00:10:04.500,00:10:09.390
"We're going to move
away from that.",00:10:09.390,00:10:10.944
"Clearly, we didn't
talk about that",00:10:10.944,00:10:12.360
"when we talked about one way
hash functions, et cetera.",00:10:12.360,00:10:14.720
"That was a different situation
where we had no secrecy.",00:10:14.720,00:10:18.500
"But here, we wanted symmetry.",00:10:18.500,00:10:21.770
"The big question
that you would ask",00:10:21.770,00:10:23.560
"and you should ask yourself
when you see this, you say,",00:10:23.560,00:10:26.590
OK great.,00:10:26.590,00:10:27.470
"I can build symmetric key
encryption algorithms.",00:10:27.470,00:10:30.810
"They're actually, I would
say, somewhat easier",00:10:30.810,00:10:32.790
"to do than to build
hash functions, which",00:10:32.790,00:10:36.020
"have a whole lot of more
interesting properties",00:10:36.020,00:10:39.560
"and hard to obtain properties
like collusion resistance.",00:10:39.560,00:10:43.260
"But the question really
is how do Alice and Bob",00:10:43.260,00:10:48.470
"share the secret key, k?",00:10:48.470,00:10:50.950
So you need that.,00:10:50.950,00:10:52.040
"You need this 128-bit
number in order",00:10:52.040,00:10:54.770
"for there to be a channel,
a secure channel, that Alice",00:10:54.770,00:10:58.750
"can communicate to Bob
with and vice verse.",00:10:58.750,00:11:02.570
"And so now you could say
Alice sends Bob a letter.",00:11:02.570,00:11:05.320
"But you know, mal could
intercept that letter.",00:11:05.320,00:11:09.000
"And even worse, what wants
to do is look at the letter,",00:11:09.000,00:11:12.930
"actually deliver
the letter, which",00:11:12.930,00:11:15.290
"is the best thing for
him, and Alice and Bob",00:11:15.290,00:11:20.920
"think that they have
a secure channel.",00:11:20.920,00:11:22.750
"That's sort of best case
scenario for mal, right?",00:11:22.750,00:11:25.360
"So you could have mal
in the middle here.",00:11:25.360,00:11:29.320
"And you've got to worry
about stuff like that.",00:11:29.320,00:11:33.050
"So key exchange, let's move
on to talk about key exchange.",00:11:33.050,00:11:39.050
"And how does the secret
key k get shared?",00:11:46.445,00:12:00.060
"You can't put this out
on a website, right?",00:12:00.060,00:12:03.980
"So it has to be
the case, sharing",00:12:03.980,00:12:06.750
"is something that has to
be secure in the sense",00:12:06.750,00:12:12.200
"that there can't be
any eavesdroppers.",00:12:12.200,00:12:14.730
"So here's my favorite example
of a puzzle that most of you",00:12:14.730,00:12:20.195
have probably heard about.,00:12:20.195,00:12:23.170
"But those of you who haven't,
it's really pretty cool.",00:12:23.170,00:12:26.800
"And those of you who have, it's
still pretty cool and worth",00:12:26.800,00:12:32.700
recalling.,00:12:32.700,00:12:33.790
"And there's actually
something that you probably",00:12:33.790,00:12:36.300
"haven't thought about
very much even if you've",00:12:36.300,00:12:38.250
heard about this puzzle.,00:12:38.250,00:12:39.450
"That's the mathematical
assumption made",00:12:39.450,00:12:42.480
in the solution of this puzzle.,00:12:42.480,00:12:44.080
That will be interesting to you.,00:12:44.080,00:12:45.930
"But the puzzle is
a pirate puzzle.",00:12:45.930,00:12:47.980
So you've got Alice and Bob.,00:12:47.980,00:12:50.050
"Let's call it the
Caribbean, because that's",00:12:50.050,00:12:51.900
my favorite ocean.,00:12:51.900,00:12:53.740
"And Alice and Bob are in
two different islands.",00:12:53.740,00:12:56.896
"And we all know there are
pirates in the Caribbean,",00:12:56.896,00:12:59.020
right?,00:12:59.020,00:13:01.600
"And so Alice and Bob want to
communicate with each other.",00:13:01.600,00:13:06.140
"And what Alice has are a bunch
of boxes and locks and keys.",00:13:06.140,00:13:12.090
"She's got the keys for
her locks and nothing else",00:13:14.930,00:13:19.150
and the same thing with Bob.,00:13:19.150,00:13:22.980
"So Bob has boxes, locks,
keys for his locks",00:13:22.980,00:13:30.460
that he can put on his boxes.,00:13:30.460,00:13:32.360
"And in this case, Alice wants
to send a message to Bob.",00:13:32.360,00:13:36.690
"And Alice wants to
exchange a key with Bob,",00:13:36.690,00:13:39.110
"so they can eventually
communicate in a secure way",00:13:39.110,00:13:43.770
"regardless of the pirates or
whoever else is listening.",00:13:43.770,00:13:47.050
"So the problem here, of
course, is that if you just",00:13:47.050,00:13:49.852
"send a message on a boat-- so
the pirates are kind of nice,",00:13:49.852,00:13:52.310
"in a way, that they
will deliver messages.",00:13:52.310,00:13:58.260
"But they are curious, right?",00:13:58.260,00:14:01.730
So they're very curious.,00:14:01.730,00:14:03.000
And they will open up boxes.,00:14:03.000,00:14:04.654
"And so that's supposed to
be a boat, by the way, not",00:14:04.654,00:14:06.820
"a box, a little mast there.",00:14:06.820,00:14:10.880
So I'm not a sailor.,00:14:10.880,00:14:14.150
"But you have these boxes that
are going to get delivered.",00:14:14.150,00:14:18.830
And the deal is this.,00:14:18.830,00:14:20.740
"If there's an open box, the
pirate's will open the box.",00:14:20.740,00:14:23.376
"And if there's any message
in it, they might read it,",00:14:23.376,00:14:25.584
they might throw it away.,00:14:25.584,00:14:26.760
"So clearly, a secret
key can be exchanged",00:14:26.760,00:14:32.550
"by just putting a box
with a message in it",00:14:32.550,00:14:36.150
if you don't lock it.,00:14:36.150,00:14:38.350
"They will not be able to
open, they'll not touch,",00:14:38.350,00:14:43.220
"and they will
deliver a locked box.",00:14:43.220,00:14:47.040
"But if they ever see a
key, they'll keep it.",00:14:47.040,00:14:51.390
"If they ever see kind
of a key on the boat,",00:14:51.390,00:14:53.435
"they'll just grab
it and keep it.",00:14:53.435,00:14:54.810
"And then the next time
around, they see a locked box,",00:14:54.810,00:14:57.018
"they'll stick the key
in and try and open it.",00:14:57.018,00:15:00.140
All right.,00:15:00.140,00:15:01.970
"So how do Alice and Bob
securely exchange a secret",00:15:01.970,00:15:06.340
"where security is based
on this notion of piracy,",00:15:06.340,00:15:09.600
"I guess, with the pirates having
a certain amount of capability",00:15:09.600,00:15:16.980
"in terms of storing keys,
and opening up the locks,",00:15:16.980,00:15:20.610
"but they will not
touch a locked box?",00:15:20.610,00:15:23.460
All right.,00:15:23.460,00:15:24.635
So that's the puzzle.,00:15:24.635,00:15:25.510
"How many of you have heard
of this puzzle before?",00:15:25.510,00:15:27.790
So all of you keep quiet.,00:15:27.790,00:15:30.090
"Someone who hasn't heard
of this puzzle before,",00:15:30.090,00:15:34.350
"think for a few seconds here and
see if a solution occurs to you",00:15:34.350,00:15:39.770
"with respect to going back and
forth-- so that's the hint,",00:15:39.770,00:15:43.490
"going back and forth-- and
being able to securely exchange",00:15:43.490,00:15:47.980
"a message, which could be a
128-bit secret key written",00:15:47.980,00:15:51.660
"on a little note
between Alice and Bob.",00:15:51.660,00:15:55.060
Yeah?,00:15:55.060,00:15:55.560
Back there.,00:15:55.560,00:15:56.578
"AUDIENCE: Are they allowed
to pass locks such that--",00:15:56.578,00:16:00.780
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: So
if you see it locked,",00:16:00.780,00:16:02.530
"they'll throw away
the lock, too.",00:16:02.530,00:16:04.510
"If the lock is on
the box, then sure,",00:16:04.510,00:16:08.370
they will deliver that box.,00:16:08.370,00:16:10.340
"But if the key is
outside of that box,",00:16:10.340,00:16:12.610
then they'll keep the key.,00:16:12.610,00:16:13.960
No-- this is a difficult puzzle.,00:16:21.990,00:16:24.270
Yeah?,00:16:24.270,00:16:26.246
"AUDIENCE: Alice could lock
the box and send it to Bob.",00:16:26.246,00:16:29.107
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yeah.,00:16:29.107,00:16:30.065
"AUDIENCE: And then Bob
could also lock the box.",00:16:30.065,00:16:34.572
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yeah.,00:16:34.572,00:16:35.900
And then?,00:16:35.900,00:16:37.090
"At that point-- no,
you're on the right track.",00:16:37.090,00:16:40.801
Keep going.,00:16:40.801,00:16:41.300
Just push it a little more.,00:16:41.300,00:16:43.740
"Couple of more boat
rides and we're done.",00:16:43.740,00:16:46.492
Yeah.,00:16:46.492,00:16:48.456
"AUDIENCE: And then
if Bob sends--",00:16:48.456,00:16:52.501
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: So there's
now two locks on the box.",00:16:52.501,00:16:54.750
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:16:54.750,00:16:55.590
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: And Bob
has two locks on the box.",00:16:55.590,00:16:58.562
"And so what's Bob
going to do next?",00:16:58.562,00:17:00.020
"What's the logical thing
for Bob to do next?",00:17:00.020,00:17:03.742
AUDIENCE: Send it back to Alice.,00:17:03.742,00:17:05.089
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
Send it back Alice.",00:17:05.089,00:17:06.630
And now the key's inside.,00:17:06.630,00:17:10.300
"Alice now sees two
locks on the box.",00:17:10.300,00:17:14.170
And one of the locks is Bobs.,00:17:14.170,00:17:16.420
And other is?,00:17:16.420,00:17:17.180
AUDIENCE: Hers.,00:17:17.180,00:17:18.069
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Is hers.,00:17:18.069,00:17:18.690
AUDIENCE: She can unlock it.,00:17:18.690,00:17:19.380
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: She
can unlock the box",00:17:19.380,00:17:21.046
and send it back to Bob.,00:17:21.046,00:17:23.540
"And all of this time, the only
thing that's gone in transit",00:17:23.540,00:17:27.650
is a locked box.,00:17:27.650,00:17:29.750
"No keys have gone
into in transit,",00:17:29.750,00:17:32.050
"whether they're inside
the box or wherever.",00:17:32.050,00:17:34.400
"But the only thing that's
moved is a locked box.",00:17:34.400,00:17:38.720
So that's good.,00:17:38.720,00:17:39.410
You're exactly right.,00:17:39.410,00:17:40.550
So that gets you a Frisbee.,00:17:40.550,00:17:45.110
"Whoops, sorry.",00:17:45.110,00:17:46.930
We need a secure exchange there.,00:17:46.930,00:17:48.710
"Yeah, that's good.",00:17:48.710,00:17:50.730
So that is exactly right.,00:17:50.730,00:17:54.250
"So just to recap, Alice
locks box with KA,",00:17:54.250,00:18:05.610
"and that's the key for
the lock, sends it to Bob.",00:18:05.610,00:18:09.980
"Bob locks box with
KB, sends it to Alice.",00:18:09.980,00:18:18.320
"And Alice unlocks--
oh, I should've said",00:18:18.320,00:18:24.220
that Alice puts message in box.,00:18:24.220,00:18:27.100
"And that message has the
secret key inside of it.",00:18:32.590,00:18:36.630
"Alice unlocks KA and
sends box to Bob.",00:18:36.630,00:18:45.840
"And then Bob unlocks
KB and reads message.",00:18:45.840,00:18:56.130
So that's good.,00:18:56.130,00:18:57.470
That's all good.,00:18:57.470,00:18:59.870
"Let's look at it a
little more deeply",00:18:59.870,00:19:03.480
"and think about it from a
mathematical standpoint, not",00:19:03.480,00:19:08.170
a physical standpoint.,00:19:08.170,00:19:09.330
"You could think about it from
a physical standpoint as well.",00:19:09.330,00:19:11.990
"What is the relationship between
this locking, this sequence,",00:19:11.990,00:19:18.050
"in this case a pair of
locks, that we require here",00:19:18.050,00:19:22.550
"in order for this to
physically make sense?",00:19:22.550,00:19:25.310
s,00:19:25.310,00:19:25.810
"I mean, there's
different ways that you",00:19:25.810,00:19:27.435
could add two locks to a box.,00:19:27.435,00:19:29.890
There's many different ways.,00:19:29.890,00:19:32.120
"One way is to have a box that is
locked if I look it over here.",00:19:32.120,00:19:37.440
"And it doesn't open, because
the lid doesn't open.",00:19:37.440,00:19:39.630
I've got suitcases like that.,00:19:39.630,00:19:41.310
"And then there could
be another spot here",00:19:41.310,00:19:43.549
that looks it as well.,00:19:43.549,00:19:44.465
So that could be one way.,00:19:47.030,00:19:49.090
"Well, what's another
way of having two locks?",00:19:49.090,00:19:51.800
Yeah,00:19:51.800,00:19:52.300
"AUDIENCE: Putting
a box within a box.",00:19:52.300,00:19:53.680
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yeah,
putting a box within a box.",00:19:53.680,00:19:54.860
That's great.,00:19:54.860,00:19:56.090
"So if you put a box within
a box, then does this work?",00:19:56.090,00:20:02.270
"It doesn't work, right?",00:20:02.270,00:20:04.090
"So nested locks
actually don't work.",00:20:04.090,00:20:06.350
"Because what happened here is
that KA was put first, then KB.",00:20:06.350,00:20:17.680
"And if, in fact, you had
KA, and then KB out there,",00:20:17.680,00:20:22.730
"then you can't remove
KA without removing KB.",00:20:22.730,00:20:35.729
"And this would be the case
where you have nested locks.",00:20:35.729,00:20:38.020
"So the mathematical
operation that we require",00:20:42.180,00:20:44.860
"is commutativity
between the locks.",00:20:44.860,00:20:48.890
And the locks need to commute.,00:20:48.890,00:20:51.010
I want to put KA in first.,00:20:51.010,00:20:53.900
"Like I described, the
physical realization",00:20:53.900,00:20:56.320
"could simply be a suitcase
with two different positions",00:20:56.320,00:20:59.440
for the two locks.,00:20:59.440,00:21:00.250
"And any one of those
positions locks the suitcase.",00:21:00.250,00:21:03.760
"So you put KA here, KB here.",00:21:03.760,00:21:05.820
"And then you can
take KA out, right?",00:21:05.820,00:21:08.400
"And it's still locked,
because you have KB.",00:21:08.400,00:21:10.860
"So this commutativity between
the locks and essentially",00:21:10.860,00:21:20.130
the keys is what's required.,00:21:20.130,00:21:24.200
"And so now, let's
move away from pirates",00:21:27.490,00:21:30.930
"and go into the
cryptography domain,",00:21:30.930,00:21:33.930
"pure mathematical
domain, and see",00:21:33.930,00:21:36.670
"how this turns
into what's called",00:21:36.670,00:21:38.740
"the Diffie-Hellman key exchange,
which is a key exchange",00:21:38.740,00:21:43.130
"algorithm or a protocol that
under certain conditions",00:21:43.130,00:21:48.720
"give you exactly
what you see here.",00:21:48.720,00:21:50.590
"It gives you a
secure key exchange.",00:21:50.590,00:21:52.420
"And there's one issue
associated with it,",00:21:52.420,00:21:55.410
"and that'll be kind of clear
once we write it out here,",00:21:55.410,00:21:58.020
that we'll get back to.,00:21:58.020,00:21:59.720
"But Diffie-Hellman key
exchange assumes that you",00:21:59.720,00:22:02.430
have commutative locks.,00:22:02.430,00:22:04.420
And this is how it works.,00:22:04.420,00:22:09.930
"You'll see what commutes
when I give you the equations",00:22:09.930,00:22:16.040
"associated with
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.",00:22:16.040,00:22:18.760
"And this is also
described in the '70s.",00:22:18.760,00:22:25.100
"So what we're going to do is
we're going to work in a finite",00:22:25.100,00:22:29.630
field Fp*.,00:22:29.630,00:22:33.120
"And the finite field
means that we're",00:22:33.120,00:22:36.450
"going to be doing mod
p, where p is prime.",00:22:36.450,00:22:41.820
"And the star means we're
going to be only looking",00:22:41.820,00:22:45.060
at invertible elements only.,00:22:45.060,00:22:48.930
"So we drop the
nonvertible elements.",00:22:48.930,00:22:52.449
"These things aren't
particularly important.",00:22:52.449,00:22:54.240
And so we'll drop 0.,00:22:57.470,00:22:59.560
"And we'll be looking
at 1, 2, to p minus 1.",00:22:59.560,00:23:03.480
"So all the numbers
that you see are going",00:23:03.480,00:23:05.330
to be 1 through p minus 1.,00:23:05.330,00:23:07.690
"Now, what is the analog
all this protocol",00:23:07.690,00:23:14.440
"that Alice and Bob,
in our pirate puzzle,",00:23:14.440,00:23:20.120
operated on or ran?,00:23:20.120,00:23:23.070
"What is the analog in
the mathematical domain",00:23:23.070,00:23:27.070
or in the finite field domain?,00:23:27.070,00:23:29.060
"Well, here's what happens.",00:23:29.060,00:23:31.100
"Alice is going to
select a random a.",00:23:31.100,00:23:39.691
"And we're going to
assume the g is public.",00:23:43.128,00:23:45.450
"So she just shouts
that out to-- Alice",00:23:45.450,00:23:51.880
can see Bob from her house.,00:23:51.880,00:23:54.950
"So she shouts out
g and shouts out p.",00:23:54.950,00:23:58.069
They're all public.,00:23:58.069,00:23:58.860
"She doesn't care if the
pirates can hear this.",00:23:58.860,00:24:02.680
"And Alice is going to
select a, which is random,",00:24:02.680,00:24:06.440
and compute g of a.,00:24:06.440,00:24:11.810
"And this is in the
finite field, capital G.",00:24:11.810,00:24:15.470
So you're going to do your mods.,00:24:15.470,00:24:17.310
"And she's just going to send
over g of a over to Bob.",00:24:17.310,00:24:23.550
"Now, what Bob does is select
b and computes g raise to b",00:24:23.550,00:24:37.540
and sends that over.,00:24:37.540,00:24:40.490
"So g raised to a is
being sent over. g",00:24:40.490,00:24:42.950
"raised to b is being sent
over, sent over to Alice.",00:24:42.950,00:24:45.600
So Alice gets g raised to b.,00:24:45.600,00:24:49.160
"And the key realization
here is that Alice",00:24:49.160,00:24:53.880
"can compute g raised to b raised
to a, because she knows a.",00:24:53.880,00:25:02.880
This is all going to be mod p.,00:25:02.880,00:25:05.030
"And we're going to call that
K. And thanks to the fact",00:25:05.030,00:25:08.200
"that exponentiation
commutes, Bob",00:25:08.200,00:25:14.210
"computes g raised to a
raised to b, because Bob",00:25:14.210,00:25:20.810
"knows b, which is also
exactly K-- I should say mod",00:25:20.810,00:25:25.727
p over here.,00:25:25.727,00:25:28.827
Everything is mod p.,00:25:28.827,00:25:29.660
So that's it.,00:25:33.430,00:25:34.920
"That's Diffie-Hellman
key exchange.",00:25:34.920,00:25:38.040
"You have now created
a shared secret",00:25:38.040,00:25:41.690
"based on the commutativity
of exponentiation.",00:25:41.690,00:25:46.110
"And the part that's
still missing here",00:25:46.110,00:25:49.840
"with respect to the analogy
is the fact that g of a",00:25:49.840,00:25:55.032
is essentially the locked box.,00:25:55.032,00:25:57.760
So what g of a is hiding is a.,00:25:57.760,00:26:01.690
"Because you want a to be hidden
here and the same thing with g",00:26:01.690,00:26:05.160
of b.,00:26:05.160,00:26:05.660
It needs to hide b.,00:26:05.660,00:26:07.080
"So the problem that the
pirates had was they",00:26:07.080,00:26:11.700
couldn't open up the box.,00:26:11.700,00:26:14.420
"The problem that the adversary,
let's call them mal, has",00:26:14.420,00:26:19.170
"is that he has to invert g
of a in order to discover a.",00:26:19.170,00:26:26.630
"And in this particular
finite field,",00:26:26.630,00:26:30.870
"and many such finite fields,
you can think of this",00:26:30.870,00:26:34.990
"as being what's called a
discrete logarithm problem.",00:26:34.990,00:26:37.370
"So if you don't
know how to computer",00:26:37.370,00:26:38.870
"logarithms in that
continuous domain.",00:26:38.870,00:26:41.099
And there's tables.,00:26:41.099,00:26:41.890
And it's pretty easy to do.,00:26:41.890,00:26:43.720
"But this is what's called
a discrete logarithm",00:26:43.720,00:26:45.740
"problem, because we're
in a finite field.",00:26:45.740,00:26:48.400
"And we obviously want
integers. a is an integer.",00:26:48.400,00:26:50.980
"So we need to discover
what does that integer is.",00:26:50.980,00:26:54.800
"Because we're doing
the mod p, et cetera,",00:26:54.800,00:26:56.800
"and p is typically
on a large number,",00:26:56.800,00:26:59.490
"it's actually a hard
problem computationally",00:26:59.490,00:27:02.650
to do a discrete log.,00:27:02.650,00:27:05.520
"So when you see g of a,
you know g, you know p,",00:27:05.520,00:27:10.820
"but trying to figure out
what produced that g of a",00:27:10.820,00:27:15.710
is a difficult problem.,00:27:15.710,00:27:16.920
"And people have looked
at this for 30, 40 years",00:27:16.920,00:27:19.010
"and there's not great
algorithms to solve",00:27:19.010,00:27:21.929
"this problem, certainly
not anything that's",00:27:21.929,00:27:23.720
polynomial time solvable.,00:27:23.720,00:27:25.440
"They're all kind
of subexponential.",00:27:25.440,00:27:27.550
"And you can make the numbers
large enough such that g of a",00:27:27.550,00:27:32.070
"is secure in the sense that it
doesn't give away what a is.",00:27:32.070,00:27:37.270
"So that's the insight here
that Diffie and Hellman had,",00:27:37.270,00:27:43.260
"which comes down to the
discrete log problem is hard.",00:27:43.260,00:27:55.020
"And what this simply
means is given g of a,",00:27:55.020,00:27:59.910
"the discrete log
problem is compute a.",00:27:59.910,00:28:03.160
"And the same thing
for b, of course.",00:28:03.160,00:28:05.950
"There's one other
thing that you want",00:28:05.950,00:28:09.300
"to say to be precise
to sort of just",00:28:09.300,00:28:11.400
"cover the spectrum with respect
to how this could break.",00:28:11.400,00:28:15.490
"And that is what's called
the Diffie-Hellman problem,",00:28:15.490,00:28:19.340
"for want of a better names and
since these are the folks who",00:28:19.340,00:28:23.470
first came up with it.,00:28:23.470,00:28:25.770
"And the Diffie-Hellman
problem is simply",00:28:25.770,00:28:27.960
"that given g of a and g of b,
which is what the pirates see",00:28:27.960,00:28:33.680
"and what the adversary
mal sees, we should not",00:28:33.680,00:28:37.610
"be able to compute g
of a times b, which",00:28:37.610,00:28:43.400
is exactly what we get here.,00:28:43.400,00:28:44.790
"g of a raised to b
is g of a times b.",00:28:44.790,00:28:47.600
"So given those two
things, if there's",00:28:47.600,00:28:49.680
"a way of computing
g of a times b,",00:28:49.680,00:28:52.990
"even though you potentially
haven't discovered",00:28:52.990,00:28:55.800
"a and b precisely,
g of a times b",00:28:55.800,00:28:59.340
"is just the secret key that
Alice and Bob exchanged.",00:28:59.340,00:29:02.060
So you're host.,00:29:02.060,00:29:03.620
"Alice and Bob are host
if mal can do this.",00:29:03.620,00:29:07.240
"So there's two
things going on here.",00:29:07.240,00:29:09.410
"You want the Diffie-Hellman
problem to be hard.",00:29:09.410,00:29:12.540
"And you want the discrete
log problem to be hard.",00:29:12.540,00:29:16.500
"OK So generally, this is
how cryptography works.",00:29:16.500,00:29:20.500
You set up protocols.,00:29:20.500,00:29:22.880
"And there's some information
that's bound to be exposed.",00:29:22.880,00:29:26.330
"You want this information
to be hard to reverse",00:29:26.330,00:29:30.280
to get the crucial information.,00:29:30.280,00:29:32.190
"That requires the computational
hardness assumption",00:29:32.190,00:29:34.890
"like the two that
we've made here.",00:29:34.890,00:29:36.760
And then you're off and running.,00:29:36.760,00:29:39.100
"Your system will break if
your computational hardness",00:29:39.100,00:29:42.060
assumptions are incorrect.,00:29:42.060,00:29:44.010
"And they may be correct
for a particular time,",00:29:44.010,00:29:46.500
"for example, the 1970s
for particular parameters.",00:29:46.500,00:29:49.910
"But they may end up being
incorrect assumptions,",00:29:49.910,00:29:53.120
"at least for those parameters,
at a later point of time,",00:29:53.120,00:29:57.180
"simply because
computers got faster.",00:29:57.180,00:30:00.160
"It's like 2 raised to 40
was this huge number when",00:30:00.160,00:30:03.110
I was your age.,00:30:03.110,00:30:04.320
"Now, it's like nothing.",00:30:04.320,00:30:05.840
"So that's basically
part of the game.",00:30:05.840,00:30:08.350
"But the good systems are those
that scale where you increase",00:30:08.350,00:30:12.670
"the parameter size and the
system and the protocol",00:30:12.670,00:30:16.470
stays the same.,00:30:16.470,00:30:17.950
"And so you just increase p,
for example, in this case.",00:30:17.950,00:30:22.510
"And the discrete
long problem is still",00:30:22.510,00:30:24.300
hard for modern computers.,00:30:24.300,00:30:26.400
"So those are the good protocols
and the good cryptosystems that",00:30:26.400,00:30:29.600
"stand the test of
time, not necessarily",00:30:29.600,00:30:31.950
"the ones that have exactly
particular parameters.",00:30:31.950,00:30:36.850
That's hard to do.,00:30:36.850,00:30:37.610
"Because as I said,
Moore's law and computers",00:30:37.610,00:30:40.650
"have been getting really
exponentially faster.",00:30:40.650,00:30:43.740
All right.,00:30:43.740,00:30:45.830
"So there's one main problem
with the Diffie-Hellman protocol",00:30:45.830,00:30:51.350
"and the solution to
our pirate puzzle.",00:30:51.350,00:30:54.020
"And so can someone tell
me-- and it could be just",00:30:54.020,00:30:57.167
"for the sake of the
Diffie-Hellman problem or just",00:30:57.167,00:30:59.250
"in the context of the
Diffie-Hellman problem,",00:30:59.250,00:31:01.130
"but also in the context of the
pirate puzzle-- what assumption",00:31:01.130,00:31:05.290
"are we making here
that's as yet unstated",00:31:05.290,00:31:08.690
"with respect to this secure key
exchange being actually secure?",00:31:08.690,00:31:14.560
Someone.,00:31:14.560,00:31:16.080
Yeah.,00:31:16.080,00:31:17.556
"AUDIENCE: If I were to intercept
a message from [INAUDIBLE]",00:31:17.556,00:31:21.500
something of their own back?,00:31:21.500,00:31:22.990
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
What does that mean?",00:31:22.990,00:31:25.060
The pirates see a locked box.,00:31:25.060,00:31:26.820
"So the first step of
the protocol, Alice",00:31:26.820,00:31:29.650
"is sending a message
inside a locked box",00:31:29.650,00:31:32.470
with a single lock in it.,00:31:32.470,00:31:33.740
"You're kind of on
the right track.",00:31:36.520,00:31:38.120
"And what could the pirates do
in order to break this protocol?",00:31:38.120,00:31:43.340
"We've kind of made
an assumption here.",00:31:43.340,00:31:45.250
"And I might have
said it explicitly.",00:31:45.250,00:31:47.955
"Yeah, go ahead.",00:31:47.955,00:31:48.580
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
throw the box away.",00:31:48.580,00:31:50.350
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: They could
just throw the box away.",00:31:50.350,00:31:51.230
"But that doesn't break the
security of the protocol.",00:31:51.230,00:31:53.396
"That breaks the functionality
of the protocol, right?",00:31:53.396,00:31:56.565
"Yeah, go ahead.",00:31:56.565,00:31:57.190
"AUDIENCE: Put their old
lock on [INAUDIBLE].",00:31:57.190,00:31:58.770
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Ah,
that's exactly right,",00:31:58.770,00:32:00.561
put their own lock on it.,00:32:00.561,00:32:01.680
"You know, if they had locks-- so
these pirates don't have locks,",00:32:01.680,00:32:05.051
right?,00:32:05.051,00:32:05.550
We're making that assumption.,00:32:05.550,00:32:06.758
"If they had their
own lock with a key,",00:32:06.758,00:32:09.330
"if they just had
a lock that locks",00:32:09.330,00:32:10.940
"and they didn't
have the key for it,",00:32:10.940,00:32:12.440
"they will wouldn't
be able to break",00:32:12.440,00:32:13.898
the security of the protocol.,00:32:13.898,00:32:15.140
"But if they had a lock
and a key for that lock,",00:32:15.140,00:32:18.910
"then they can pretend to
have delivered this to Bob.",00:32:18.910,00:32:22.350
"And there's no authenticity
here with respect to Alice",00:32:22.350,00:32:25.040
"doesn't quite know whether she's
communicating with Bob or not.",00:32:25.040,00:32:27.860
"She's at the mercy of the
pirates to deliver these boxes.",00:32:27.860,00:32:31.640
"So if the pirates had a lock
and the key for the lock,",00:32:31.640,00:32:37.480
"then we're in a situation
where Alice may have exchanged",00:32:37.480,00:32:41.760
the key with the pirates.,00:32:41.760,00:32:44.370
"And she thinks she's
exchanged it with Bob.",00:32:44.370,00:32:46.520
"And she's, in fact,
communicating with the pirates.",00:32:46.520,00:32:50.100
"So there's a man in
the middle attack,",00:32:50.100,00:33:01.340
"which corresponds to the
pirates having their own locks",00:33:01.340,00:33:10.190
and keys.,00:33:10.190,00:33:11.240
"And it's even more trivial in
the case of our picture here.",00:33:11.240,00:33:15.500
"Because assuming the
pirates know mathematics,",00:33:15.500,00:33:18.460
"they can generate a random
number-- and the number",00:33:18.460,00:33:22.020
"could be c, for example-- and
just send back g raised to c.",00:33:22.020,00:33:27.020
"And for all you know,
they could actually",00:33:27.020,00:33:30.170
"get Bob to send g
raised to b back,",00:33:30.170,00:33:34.430
"but they would intercept it and
replace it with g raised to c.",00:33:34.430,00:33:38.940
And they know what c is.,00:33:38.940,00:33:40.767
"So what's happening now
is so you can [INAUDIBLE].",00:33:40.767,00:33:42.850
"I won't to go through
all of the math here.",00:33:42.850,00:33:45.320
"But you can kind
of see it, I hope.",00:33:45.320,00:33:48.130
"You end up, if you're
Alice, exchanging",00:33:48.130,00:33:51.950
"a secret key with the
pirates as opposed to Bob.",00:33:51.950,00:33:58.030
"And the way you can set this
up is the pirates actually",00:33:58.030,00:34:03.280
"will get into a situation
where Alice and Bob think",00:34:03.280,00:34:06.070
"that they're communicating with
each other in a secure fashion,",00:34:06.070,00:34:08.980
"but the pirates can listen
to all of the messages.",00:34:08.980,00:34:11.510
"They can decrypt
all of the messages,",00:34:11.510,00:34:13.210
"because they know what
they secret key, k, is.",00:34:13.210,00:34:16.940
OK.,00:34:16.940,00:34:17.880
"And remember that
the secret key, k,",00:34:17.880,00:34:19.730
"is something that
is probably going",00:34:19.730,00:34:21.219
"to be used in a symmetric key
encryption scheme eventually",00:34:21.219,00:34:25.239
to send real messages.,00:34:25.239,00:34:28.510
"So you're going to have ciphered
text with that secret key,",00:34:28.510,00:34:31.190
"capital K, over there.",00:34:31.190,00:34:33.179
"And if the pirates or mal get to
know what the secret key, k, is",00:34:33.179,00:34:37.730
"through a man in the middle
attack, you've got problems.",00:34:37.730,00:34:41.000
All right?,00:34:41.000,00:34:42.080
"So the man in the middle
attack is something",00:34:42.080,00:34:46.139
that we have to worry about.,00:34:46.139,00:34:47.730
"What we're going
to talk about next",00:34:47.730,00:34:49.440
"is something that
addresses this problem.",00:34:49.440,00:34:53.030
"And it may not seem
like it's directly",00:34:53.030,00:34:55.739
addressing the problem.,00:34:55.739,00:34:57.200
"But fundamentally,
what's going on here",00:34:57.200,00:34:59.300
"is you need to have
authenticity in who you're",00:34:59.300,00:35:04.290
communicating with.,00:35:04.290,00:35:05.310
"Alice has to somehow
authenticate Bob.",00:35:05.310,00:35:08.080
"And Alice has to
know somehow that g",00:35:08.080,00:35:10.710
"raised to b is something
that came from Bob.",00:35:10.710,00:35:14.560
"It's not g raised to c
that came from somebody",00:35:14.560,00:35:16.780
else is in the middle.,00:35:16.780,00:35:18.380
"And that's where asymmetric key
cryptography and public keys",00:35:18.380,00:35:21.110
"come in, where you have a
certified public key associated",00:35:21.110,00:35:26.700
with yourself.,00:35:26.700,00:35:29.170
"And maybe you need
VeriSign or you",00:35:29.170,00:35:31.230
"need the DMV, or the
Registry of Motor Vehicles,",00:35:31.230,00:35:34.090
"RMV, to do this for you.",00:35:34.090,00:35:36.150
"But you create a
certified public key,",00:35:36.150,00:35:39.020
"which is associated
with your identity.",00:35:39.020,00:35:41.430
And it's public.,00:35:41.430,00:35:42.840
You can put it on a website.,00:35:42.840,00:35:45.100
"And everyone can
access it using HTTPS,",00:35:45.100,00:35:47.590
"so they know they're
going to the exact website",00:35:47.590,00:35:50.300
that you've put up.,00:35:50.300,00:35:51.740
"And that gives you a way
of identifying yourself.",00:35:51.740,00:35:57.230
"And if you can do
that, you can protect",00:35:57.230,00:35:59.440
"against the man in the
middle attack using",00:35:59.440,00:36:01.560
asymmetric key cryptography.,00:36:01.560,00:36:04.140
"So that's kind of the final
part of this puzzle that's",00:36:04.140,00:36:09.390
"associated with authentication
and secret key exchange and all",00:36:09.390,00:36:15.470
of that.,00:36:15.470,00:36:16.213
"Once we do that, you'll
know what the functionality",00:36:16.213,00:36:18.337
is that we require.,00:36:18.337,00:36:19.789
"And then we'll have
to talk about how",00:36:19.789,00:36:21.330
we can build a subsystems.,00:36:21.330,00:36:22.975
Cool.,00:36:27.520,00:36:28.020
Any questions so far?,00:36:28.020,00:36:29.560
How we doing?,00:36:29.560,00:36:32.930
OK.,00:36:32.930,00:36:33.430
"So public key encryption, let
me just do a little set up.",00:36:36.060,00:36:40.880
I said some of this last time.,00:36:40.880,00:36:44.370
"But to make sure we're on the
same page, what we have here",00:36:44.370,00:36:48.580
"is we really want a
message plus a public key.",00:36:48.580,00:36:53.970
"And you want to obtain ciphered
text using this operation.",00:36:53.970,00:37:02.680
"And this plus is not
arithmetic addition.",00:37:02.680,00:37:05.920
"It's just that we're putting
these two things together",00:37:05.920,00:37:08.900
"into an algorithm, a public
key encryption algorithm, that",00:37:08.900,00:37:11.930
produces ciphered text.,00:37:11.930,00:37:13.500
All right.,00:37:13.500,00:37:14.290
"And this public key, just to
reiterate what I just said,",00:37:14.290,00:37:18.910
"is going to be if Alice
is producing the message",00:37:18.910,00:37:23.790
"and Bob is getting
the ciphered text,",00:37:23.790,00:37:26.460
"this is going to be
Bob's public key.",00:37:26.460,00:37:30.650
"And the fact that
it's Bob's public key",00:37:30.650,00:37:33.800
"is something that
Alice should be",00:37:33.800,00:37:35.420
"able to authenticate
using VeriSign, using",00:37:35.420,00:37:38.370
"the Register of Motor
Vehicles, what have you.",00:37:38.370,00:37:40.574
"That's what's going to
protect against the man",00:37:40.574,00:37:42.490
in the middle attack.,00:37:42.490,00:37:43.600
OK.,00:37:43.600,00:37:44.690
"We're not going to
talk a lot about how",00:37:44.690,00:37:47.790
you can get a certificate.,00:37:47.790,00:37:48.920
"Your MIT certificate
is something which",00:37:48.920,00:37:51.340
corresponds to your MIT ID.,00:37:51.340,00:37:54.310
"It's got information, what year
you are, what your name is.",00:37:54.310,00:37:57.330
"And when you generate
that certificate,",00:37:57.330,00:37:59.470
"you are getting a certificate of
authenticity that you are you.",00:37:59.470,00:38:03.886
"And of course,
you give that away",00:38:03.886,00:38:05.260
"and you hand it to
someone else, someone",00:38:05.260,00:38:07.180
can pretend to be you as well.,00:38:07.180,00:38:09.160
"But that's what's happening
when we talk about public keys",00:38:09.160,00:38:13.860
and you owning public keys.,00:38:13.860,00:38:17.500
"We're not going to, as I said,
get into that very much more.",00:38:17.500,00:38:21.390
"I'm more interested in
describing this algorithm",00:38:21.390,00:38:25.310
for public key encryption.,00:38:25.310,00:38:26.960
"We'll look at a couple that
produces a ciphered text given",00:38:26.960,00:38:31.410
a message and a public key.,00:38:31.410,00:38:34.440
"Now, of course,
what Bob needs to do",00:38:34.440,00:38:37.130
is to take the ciphered text.,00:38:37.130,00:38:41.670
And this is what Bob's doing.,00:38:41.670,00:38:43.750
"And Bob has a private key that
is distinct from the public key",00:38:43.750,00:38:53.360
"and needs to get back exactly
the message using a decryption",00:38:53.360,00:38:57.600
"algorithm that corresponds to
the message that Alice sent.",00:38:57.600,00:39:01.680
OK.,00:39:01.680,00:39:02.720
"And this whole thing is
going to work provided",00:39:02.720,00:39:10.010
"knowing the public
key, let's call it PK,",00:39:10.010,00:39:15.010
and the private key.,00:39:15.010,00:39:16.060
"We can't call it PK
as well, obviously.",00:39:16.060,00:39:17.990
So we call it SK.,00:39:17.990,00:39:19.960
"Knowing the PK does
not reveal anything",00:39:19.960,00:39:26.770
"in a mathematical
sense about SK.",00:39:26.770,00:39:33.290
"But obviously, in order for
this whole thing to work,",00:39:33.290,00:39:36.740
"PK and SK have to have some
mathematical relationship.",00:39:36.740,00:39:42.950
"And the different
cryptosystems including RSA,",00:39:42.950,00:39:46.070
"and we look at a
knapsack cryptosystem,",00:39:46.070,00:39:48.330
"all have different algorithms
for encryption and decryption.",00:39:48.330,00:39:53.310
"And they have different
mathematical relationships",00:39:53.310,00:39:55.780
between PK and SK.,00:39:55.780,00:39:57.440
"And for each of
these relationships,",00:39:57.440,00:40:00.320
"you have to show that
the adversary has",00:40:00.320,00:40:03.260
"to solve a computationally
hard problem in order",00:40:03.260,00:40:06.580
to discover SK given PK.,00:40:06.580,00:40:12.140
"And it turns out that for
most of these systems,",00:40:12.140,00:40:14.870
"it's symmetric in the sense
that these algorithms,",00:40:14.870,00:40:19.330
"at least for RSA, you
could use either one",00:40:19.330,00:40:23.120
of these interchangeably.,00:40:23.120,00:40:25.690
"And there's issues
associated with that.",00:40:25.690,00:40:27.390
"So we really won't go
too deep into that.",00:40:27.390,00:40:30.120
"But what I said you should
hold, which is you have one,",00:40:30.120,00:40:35.660
"it shouldn't tell you
anything about the other.",00:40:35.660,00:40:38.360
"There has to be a
computationally hard problem",00:40:38.360,00:40:40.760
"associated with
discovering one of these",00:40:40.760,00:40:44.790
only given the one other.,00:40:44.790,00:40:48.350
"And we'll talk about
what those hardness",00:40:48.350,00:40:50.410
"assumptions are certainly
for RSA and also",00:40:50.410,00:40:53.580
"for another
cryptosystem, a knapsack.",00:40:53.580,00:40:57.730
"So we're going to
present RSA, which",00:40:57.730,00:41:00.270
is this real magical algorithm.,00:41:00.270,00:41:02.400
It's amazing it works.,00:41:02.400,00:41:04.580
"Every time I prepare
for this lecture,",00:41:04.580,00:41:08.100
I got to relearn somethings.,00:41:08.100,00:41:10.130
"And that's because there's
one subtle aspect of this.",00:41:10.130,00:41:17.370
It's all about number theory.,00:41:17.370,00:41:18.580
"Number theory can
get pretty subtle.",00:41:18.580,00:41:21.190
"But it's also intricate enough
that I forget the details.",00:41:21.190,00:41:26.850
So let's get started on that.,00:41:26.850,00:41:30.030
"Basically, RSA is based on
primes and factoring numbers",00:41:30.030,00:41:37.300
"into primes and
using number theory",00:41:37.300,00:41:42.760
"to make sure that you
can actually accomplish",00:41:42.760,00:41:45.820
what this is trying to do.,00:41:45.820,00:41:49.050
"The functionality
of RSA should be",00:41:49.050,00:41:51.580
"distinct from the
security of RSA.",00:41:51.580,00:41:55.550
"When we talk about the
functionality of RSA,",00:41:55.550,00:41:57.450
"we are saying for
any message, if Alice",00:41:57.450,00:42:01.390
"uses Bob's public
key to encrypt it,",00:42:01.390,00:42:05.270
"the ciphered text
resulting from that",00:42:05.270,00:42:07.780
"should be decryptable
into exactly the message",00:42:07.780,00:42:11.700
"that Alice sent given
Bob's private key.",00:42:11.700,00:42:16.220
"That's the functional
requirement",00:42:16.220,00:42:18.240
"of a public key
encryption algorithm",00:42:18.240,00:42:21.120
or a public key cryptosystem.,00:42:21.120,00:42:23.220
"The security requirement of
a public key cryptosystem",00:42:23.220,00:42:26.690
is what I wrote up there.,00:42:26.690,00:42:28.520
"It's the knowledge of
SK should be hidden even",00:42:28.520,00:42:32.540
given the knowledge of PK.,00:42:32.540,00:42:33.790
"And there's precise
computational hardness",00:42:33.790,00:42:36.190
"assumptions that are associated
with each cryptosystem.",00:42:36.190,00:42:39.460
"So let's separate out
functionality from security.",00:42:39.460,00:42:41.745
"We're going to talk
about functionality",00:42:41.745,00:42:43.370
for the next few minutes.,00:42:43.370,00:42:44.411
"Alice is going to pick two
large secret primes, p and q.",00:42:47.760,00:43:00.970
"So what I'm going
to describe here",00:43:00.970,00:43:02.660
"are Alice generating her
public key and her private key.",00:43:02.660,00:43:07.480
"She's going to then
publish her public key",00:43:07.480,00:43:09.960
and keep her private key secret.,00:43:09.960,00:43:12.360
Bob does the same thing.,00:43:12.360,00:43:14.160
"And then after that,
they have to register.",00:43:14.160,00:43:16.760
"And this is not something
we'll spend time on beyond me",00:43:16.760,00:43:20.120
saying it one more time.,00:43:20.120,00:43:21.360
"They have to register their
public keys with the VeriSign",00:43:21.360,00:43:23.820
or the RMVs like I talked about.,00:43:23.820,00:43:26.190
"So everyone knows that Alice's
public key is this long number.",00:43:26.190,00:43:30.380
"But no one knows
Alice's private key.",00:43:30.380,00:43:33.500
"So Alice picks two
large secret primes.",00:43:33.500,00:43:35.860
"So these are actually
going to result",00:43:35.860,00:43:38.240
"in the creation of
our private key.",00:43:38.240,00:43:40.560
"And then Alice
computes N equals pq.",00:43:40.560,00:43:48.600
"So she just
multiplies those out.",00:43:48.600,00:43:51.320
"She chooses an
encryption exponent,",00:43:51.320,00:44:00.660
"e, which satisfies this
little equation, which",00:44:00.660,00:44:07.600
"says that it's relatively
prime in relation",00:44:07.600,00:44:11.560
to p minus 1 times q minus 1.,00:44:11.560,00:44:14.880
And she knows p and q.,00:44:14.880,00:44:15.910
"So she can compute p
minus 1 times q minus 1.",00:44:15.910,00:44:19.550
"So the gcd of e and p
minus 1, q minus 1 is 1.",00:44:19.550,00:44:24.010
"And you can certainly
accomplish this simply",00:44:24.010,00:44:26.740
by choosing e to be a prime.,00:44:26.740,00:44:29.890
"Because then a gcd of a prime
with anything else is 1.",00:44:29.890,00:44:34.600
"And it turns out that RSA uses--
this is all going to be public,",00:44:34.600,00:44:39.130
by the way.,00:44:39.130,00:44:41.370
e is going to be public.,00:44:41.370,00:44:42.560
So you can just fix that.,00:44:42.560,00:44:44.080
"And most RSA algorithms just
fix that to be a small number.",00:44:44.080,00:44:48.470
"The encryption exponent
is a small number.",00:44:48.470,00:44:51.430
"And the reason
it's a small number",00:44:51.430,00:44:52.910
"is because you're worried
about performance.",00:44:52.910,00:44:55.160
"And we're going to
exponentiate using e.",00:44:55.160,00:44:57.500
"And the smaller it is,
the faster the encryption",00:44:57.500,00:44:59.750
is going to go.,00:44:59.750,00:45:00.910
"So if you want to encrypt
fast and decrypt more slowly,",00:45:00.910,00:45:04.530
"unfortunately, that's
the trade off here.",00:45:04.530,00:45:06.910
You would pick a small e.,00:45:06.910,00:45:08.127
"And then we're going to compute
our decryption exponent, which",00:45:08.127,00:45:10.710
"obviously is going to
have to be private.",00:45:10.710,00:45:12.650
"Because that's part
of our private key.",00:45:12.650,00:45:14.470
"But that's going to be
bigger if e is small.",00:45:14.470,00:45:16.810
And that's just a trade off.,00:45:16.810,00:45:18.349
"It's symmetric in the
sense that while it's",00:45:18.349,00:45:20.140
"an asymmetric
algorithm, it's kind of",00:45:20.140,00:45:21.940
"symmetric in the
mathematical sense",00:45:21.940,00:45:24.290
"that the private keys and
the public key operations",00:45:24.290,00:45:28.160
are symmetric.,00:45:28.160,00:45:30.910
So what is Alice's public key?,00:45:30.910,00:45:33.015
"Well, Alice's public key,
which she can then publish,",00:45:33.015,00:45:39.540
"is simply m, e.",00:45:39.540,00:45:42.130
OK.,00:45:42.130,00:45:42.630
"Now, the fun starts.",00:45:50.740,00:45:53.920
"We have to figure out
what the private key is",00:45:53.920,00:45:56.520
going to correspond to.,00:45:56.520,00:45:58.070
"And it turns out-- and
this is one of those things",00:45:58.070,00:46:02.220
"where how did they
ever think of this?",00:46:02.220,00:46:05.110
"And that's still
true 40 years later.",00:46:05.110,00:46:09.020
"You get the decryption exponent
using the extended Euclidean",00:46:09.020,00:46:15.155
algorithm.,00:46:15.155,00:46:15.655
"And this is done by Alice
secretly, where what you want",00:46:24.280,00:46:30.490
"is to have the relationship
that e times d is 1.",00:46:30.490,00:46:35.110
"And this is mod p
minus 1, q minus 1.",00:46:35.110,00:46:41.230
"And there's algorithms
out there that",00:46:41.230,00:46:44.540
"would find the inverse
that corresponds to d for e",00:46:44.540,00:46:50.150
or vice versa.,00:46:50.150,00:46:51.520
And they're polytime algorithms.,00:46:51.520,00:46:53.810
"As long as you know this number
here, mod p minus 1, q minus 1,",00:46:53.810,00:46:58.149
"and you know that Alice
knows that, you can",00:46:58.149,00:46:59.940
get your decryption exponent.,00:46:59.940,00:47:02.210
"And typically, if a is small, as
I said, d is going to be large.",00:47:02.210,00:47:06.880
"By the way, the
numbers here, p and q,",00:47:06.880,00:47:09.590
"are going to be the
roughly 1,000 bits long.",00:47:09.590,00:47:12.710
"So that's essentially-- we're
talking about huge primes here.",00:47:12.710,00:47:15.650
"And so n would be 2048
bits in that case.",00:47:15.650,00:47:19.180
"So the private key,
Alice's private key,",00:47:19.180,00:47:27.010
"you can think of as d, p, q.",00:47:27.010,00:47:32.450
"So now, it's clear as to what's
public and what's private.",00:47:32.450,00:47:35.255
n and e are public.,00:47:35.255,00:47:37.040
"d, p, and q are private.",00:47:37.040,00:47:40.950
So that's the set up for RSA.,00:47:40.950,00:47:43.030
"And it's not at all clear
that RSA accomplishes",00:47:43.030,00:47:48.160
"either of the two things that
we need, the first of which",00:47:48.160,00:47:52.700
"is functionality, the fact that
encrypting, and then decrypting",00:47:52.700,00:47:57.490
"a message should get
you back that message.",00:47:57.490,00:48:00.470
"So that's the first
thing we need to look at.",00:48:00.470,00:48:02.580
"And the security part is
actually a little bit easier.",00:48:02.580,00:48:05.140
"Because you can see
we're going to have",00:48:05.140,00:48:07.190
"to make assumptions
about factoring primes",00:48:07.190,00:48:11.460
and so on and so forth.,00:48:11.460,00:48:13.050
"Right here, you can just
see that immediately.",00:48:13.050,00:48:15.690
"The biggest
assumption made by RSA",00:48:15.690,00:48:18.590
"from a computational
hardness standpoint",00:48:18.590,00:48:20.840
"is simply that if
the adversary sees n,",00:48:20.840,00:48:24.450
"that they should not be able
to factor it into p and q.",00:48:24.450,00:48:28.660
"Because if they can
do that, it's over.",00:48:28.660,00:48:30.860
"So that's actually easier than
the functionality argument.",00:48:30.860,00:48:35.870
So why does this work?,00:48:35.870,00:48:37.130
"And amazingly, we can actually
do this in about 10 minutes.",00:48:42.970,00:48:46.080
"I'm going to explain to you
why this works in 10 minutes.",00:48:46.080,00:48:49.350
"And the only theorem
that we'll require",00:48:49.350,00:48:53.570
"on top of this, which
I will not approve,",00:48:53.570,00:48:56.720
"because Fermat proved
it centuries ago,",00:48:56.720,00:49:01.130
"is Fermat's Little
Theorem that says",00:49:01.130,00:49:05.830
"that when you have
p being a prime--",00:49:05.830,00:49:12.020
"you can think of this
as a special case.",00:49:12.020,00:49:13.985
"You take m, and m is
an arbitrary number.",00:49:23.870,00:49:27.290
"And if p is a prime, then
this relationship holds.",00:49:27.290,00:49:34.760
"So you raise it to the p minus
1 power, and you get 1, mod p.",00:49:34.760,00:49:39.190
"So that's Fermat's
Little Theorem",00:49:39.190,00:49:40.980
that's going to be required.,00:49:40.980,00:49:42.160
"And that's pretty
much the only thing",00:49:42.160,00:49:43.701
"that you have to invoke beyond
sort of standard mod arithmetic",00:49:43.701,00:49:47.980
to show that RSA works.,00:49:47.980,00:49:51.720
So what's going on here?,00:49:51.720,00:49:53.010
"Let's call phi p minus
1 times q minus 1.",00:49:53.010,00:49:58.734
"Obviously, that's showed
up a couple of times.",00:49:58.734,00:50:00.650
"And you may as well
represent it by using",00:50:00.650,00:50:03.190
"a smaller, simpler symbol.",00:50:03.190,00:50:05.830
So we'll call that phi.,00:50:05.830,00:50:07.530
"And we are going to
say that d equals 1.",00:50:07.530,00:50:13.870
Mod phi is given to us.,00:50:13.870,00:50:16.280
"And therefore, we can say
that ed equals 1 plus k phi.",00:50:21.870,00:50:28.490
So that's it.,00:50:31.080,00:50:32.840
All I'm saying is the remainder.,00:50:32.840,00:50:34.510
"Then you took to the mod
with respect to phi was 1.",00:50:34.510,00:50:37.790
"So the actual number
was 1 plus k times phi.",00:50:37.790,00:50:40.900
k is some integer.,00:50:40.900,00:50:43.300
"Think of it as a
positive integer.",00:50:43.300,00:50:46.390
"Remember that we now have the
p and the q are over there.",00:50:46.390,00:50:50.570
And p and q are primes.,00:50:50.570,00:50:52.440
So p and q are primes.,00:50:52.440,00:50:56.230
"And given that that's
the case, we really",00:50:56.230,00:50:58.980
have two cases to analyze.,00:50:58.980,00:51:02.310
"Oh, I'm sorry.",00:51:02.310,00:51:03.210
"I missed one crucial point,
which I should have told you,",00:51:03.210,00:51:14.530
which is I gave you this.,00:51:14.530,00:51:16.360
"But I didn't actually
tell you what is going on.",00:51:16.360,00:51:20.050
"I mentioned it in
passing, exponentiation.",00:51:20.050,00:51:23.040
"But I didn't tell you
exactly what the encryption",00:51:23.040,00:51:25.980
"algorithm was and the
decryption algorithm was.",00:51:25.980,00:51:28.670
"And obviously, you
need that in order",00:51:28.670,00:51:30.250
to prove their correctness.,00:51:30.250,00:51:31.270
"I mean, it'd be
wonderful if you could",00:51:31.270,00:51:32.853
prove correctness of this.,00:51:32.853,00:51:33.990
"There exists an
algorithm that is such",00:51:33.990,00:51:38.440
"that RSA works or public
key encryption works.",00:51:38.440,00:51:43.340
"So it turns out it's
extremely straightforward.",00:51:43.340,00:51:46.240
c equals m raised to e.,00:51:46.240,00:51:48.660
"And that's part
of the usefulness",00:51:48.660,00:51:51.210
"and the power of RSA,
which is you take m",00:51:51.210,00:51:56.315
and you exponentiate it.,00:51:56.315,00:51:58.860
"And you take c and
you exponentiate it.",00:51:58.860,00:52:04.310
And the first is the encryption.,00:52:04.310,00:52:06.350
"You get the c
through encryption,",00:52:06.350,00:52:08.480
"as you can see over
there, the ciphered text.",00:52:08.480,00:52:10.440
And m is the plain text.,00:52:10.440,00:52:11.970
And you get that back.,00:52:11.970,00:52:13.500
"So our goal here is to show that
you have essentially something",00:52:13.500,00:52:24.650
"where when you exponentiate
m raised to ed,",00:52:24.650,00:52:31.660
it should give you m.,00:52:31.660,00:52:34.060
"For these choices that
we have, of e and d,",00:52:36.730,00:52:40.080
"we've set up the d
in such a way that m",00:52:40.080,00:52:43.160
"raised to ed-- because if
you just go do encryption",00:52:43.160,00:52:47.030
"followed by decryption, you
are doubly exponentiating.",00:52:47.030,00:52:51.754
That make sense?,00:52:51.754,00:52:52.420
"Ask me questions if
this doesn't make sense.",00:52:52.420,00:52:54.510
This is important.,00:52:54.510,00:52:55.600
"m raised to ed should
give you back m.",00:52:55.600,00:52:58.930
"And if you can show that
for any m, you're done.",00:52:58.930,00:53:01.860
That's the functionality of RSA.,00:53:01.860,00:53:03.920
All right.,00:53:03.920,00:53:06.550
"So that's encryption
and decryption.",00:53:06.550,00:53:08.770
"And so now let's
go back to here.",00:53:08.770,00:53:13.140
"Now, ed equals 1 mod phi.",00:53:13.140,00:53:15.340
Because I've set that up.,00:53:15.340,00:53:16.670
"This is how I
discovered d given e.",00:53:16.670,00:53:20.440
So that's a given to me.,00:53:20.440,00:53:21.440
"That's part of what's called
the key generation phase of RSA.",00:53:21.440,00:53:26.100
"And that's the
mathematical relationship",00:53:26.100,00:53:29.140
"that I keep harping on in
terms of the relationship",00:53:29.140,00:53:31.830
"between the public
and the private key.",00:53:31.830,00:53:34.320
"So given that p and q are
primes, I have two cases.",00:53:34.320,00:53:37.755
"The first case is
that gcd of m, p",00:53:43.530,00:53:50.050
"is exactly 1, which
means that the message m.",00:53:50.050,00:53:54.620
"So what I'm comparing
here, the two cases,",00:53:54.620,00:53:56.860
is I have the message.,00:53:56.860,00:53:58.220
"And I'm going to
break up the messages",00:53:58.220,00:53:59.920
into two different categories.,00:53:59.920,00:54:02.010
That's it.,00:54:02.010,00:54:03.057
"There are all kinds of
messages that are possible.",00:54:03.057,00:54:05.140
These are arbitrary numbers.,00:54:05.140,00:54:06.670
"I'm going to break them up into
two categories, one of which",00:54:06.670,00:54:10.410
"where the message is relatively
prime in relation to the prime,",00:54:10.410,00:54:14.860
p.,00:54:14.860,00:54:16.080
And it's not a multiple of p.,00:54:16.080,00:54:17.710
"That's the way you
want to think about it.",00:54:17.710,00:54:19.460
"Obviously, gcdmp would
be 2 if M were 2p.",00:54:19.460,00:54:24.100
"So the case I'm looking
at is gcd of mp equals 1.",00:54:24.100,00:54:28.850
"And then the another case is
going to be trivial, actually,",00:54:28.850,00:54:32.330
which is gcd of mp equals p.,00:54:32.330,00:54:38.060
"Did I say 2 when I said
gcd of 2p, p equals 2?",00:54:38.060,00:54:42.110
Come on.,00:54:42.110,00:54:45.100
Wake up.,00:54:45.100,00:54:45.635
"Wow, that's it.",00:54:45.635,00:54:46.260
Perfect.,00:54:46.260,00:54:47.250
Wake up.,00:54:47.250,00:54:48.230
OK.,00:54:48.230,00:54:49.710
So gcd of 2p and p is p.,00:54:49.710,00:54:53.551
So those are the two cases.,00:54:53.551,00:54:54.675
All right.,00:54:57.290,00:54:59.060
"So by Fermat's
Little Theorem, this",00:54:59.060,00:55:05.576
is really Fermat's theorem.,00:55:05.576,00:55:06.700
"And because he had a last
theorem, for some reason,",00:55:06.700,00:55:08.920
"some people call this
the Little Theorem.",00:55:08.920,00:55:11.560
But it's Fermat's theorem.,00:55:11.560,00:55:12.960
And we know what that is.,00:55:12.960,00:55:15.270
I just wrote that out there.,00:55:15.270,00:55:17.500
"You can now write something
that says what I'm going to do",00:55:17.500,00:55:21.810
"is I'm going to just take
m raised to p minus 1,",00:55:21.810,00:55:30.530
which is 1.,00:55:30.530,00:55:32.030
So this thing is 1.,00:55:32.030,00:55:33.600
"And then I'm going to raise
it to k times q minus 1.",00:55:33.600,00:55:37.254
"And you'll see why I'm
doing this in a second.",00:55:37.254,00:55:39.170
"Because I want to get the
1 plus k phi factor here.",00:55:39.170,00:55:42.270
"So I'm taking 1
and I'm raising it",00:55:42.270,00:55:44.730
"to this power, which obviously
is going to give me 1 back.",00:55:44.730,00:55:47.570
"So all of that is
straightforward.",00:55:47.570,00:55:51.100
"And then I'm going to
multiply this by m.",00:55:51.100,00:55:53.460
OK.,00:55:53.460,00:55:54.550
"And this is clearly
the same as m mod p.",00:55:54.550,00:56:02.310
"Because all I've done
is multiply it by 1.",00:56:02.310,00:56:06.320
All right.,00:56:06.320,00:56:06.820
So why did I do this?,00:56:06.820,00:56:08.310
"Well, I did this, because I
want to group together these two",00:56:08.310,00:56:12.500
exponents.,00:56:12.500,00:56:13.570
"And since I've run
out of room here,",00:56:13.570,00:56:16.990
"let me just erase and
finish this properly.",00:56:16.990,00:56:19.750
The other case is easy anyway.,00:56:19.750,00:56:21.940
"And so I can write this as 1
plus k p minus 1 q minus 1.",00:56:21.940,00:56:30.376
"And that, of course, is
exactly m raised to ed, right?",00:56:30.376,00:56:36.450
"And so what I've done here is,
because 1 times m is clearly m,",00:56:36.450,00:56:42.050
"but if I look at this,
this is m raised to ed.",00:56:42.050,00:56:45.910
So that's clearly m.,00:56:45.910,00:56:49.080
That's it.,00:56:49.080,00:56:51.760
"Just figured out that
when I have k phi",00:56:51.760,00:56:55.160
"here, that's going to
turn into 1, basically,",00:56:55.160,00:56:58.680
when you exponentiate it.,00:56:58.680,00:57:01.550
"So that's the hard part,
actually, as it turns out,",00:57:01.550,00:57:05.350
"of proving RSA's
correctness, just",00:57:05.350,00:57:09.400
"introducing this 1
raised to something.",00:57:09.400,00:57:12.770
"And then the easier
part is simply",00:57:12.770,00:57:16.360
"the case where the m is
actually a multiple of p.",00:57:16.360,00:57:20.560
"So you have a gcd
m, comma p equals p.",00:57:20.560,00:57:26.000
"And in this case, you know
that m mod p is actually 0.",00:57:26.000,00:57:31.940
Because m is a multiple of p.,00:57:31.940,00:57:34.360
"So you're basically
exponentiating 0.",00:57:34.360,00:57:36.530
What do you do with 0?,00:57:36.530,00:57:37.860
"You're going to get
0 on both sides.",00:57:37.860,00:57:40.220
"So you're sending a message
that's essentially 0 mod p",00:57:40.220,00:57:44.790
"And when you decrypt it
on that side, you get 0.",00:57:44.790,00:57:48.010
"But one last line here is
simply that m raised to ed",00:57:48.010,00:57:54.800
"is m trivially all of this
mod p if m is 0, right?",00:57:54.800,00:58:04.090
So that was the easy case.,00:58:04.090,00:58:05.784
"So it was really
pretty straightforward.",00:58:05.784,00:58:07.450
"In one case, we took 1 and we
exponentiated it and showed",00:58:07.450,00:58:10.640
the result in a couple steps.,00:58:10.640,00:58:12.170
"In the other case, you had
messages that were 0 mod p.",00:58:12.170,00:58:15.240
So it's very pretty.,00:58:15.240,00:58:16.370
It works.,00:58:16.370,00:58:17.870
And so what happened here?,00:58:17.870,00:58:20.890
"I said that m raised
to ed equals m.",00:58:20.890,00:58:23.740
"And what I did here, of
course, was I did everything.",00:58:23.740,00:58:27.500
"So it's not quite done,
a little slight of hand",00:58:27.500,00:58:30.350
"here as I switched over
and talked about mod p.",00:58:30.350,00:58:35.120
So I had mod p over here.,00:58:35.120,00:58:37.410
And I said p and q were primes.,00:58:37.410,00:58:39.340
And I looked at p first.,00:58:39.340,00:58:42.770
"But what I need to do,
just to finish this off,",00:58:42.770,00:58:45.690
"let me do this over
here, is I have",00:58:45.690,00:58:47.880
to do the same argument for q.,00:58:47.880,00:58:50.541
"And I'm going to put
it together for n.",00:58:50.541,00:58:56.160
"And the reason for that is
simply that I have n over here.",00:58:56.160,00:59:00.530
So remember n equals p times q.,00:59:00.530,00:59:03.050
"The encryption and
that decryption",00:59:03.050,00:59:06.460
are going to be done mod o.,00:59:06.460,00:59:09.580
"Certainly, the encryption has
to be done mod n, because n",00:59:09.580,00:59:13.210
"is only public
number that you have",00:59:13.210,00:59:15.760
"that you can mod with, correct?",00:59:15.760,00:59:17.670
"So what I've done here,
this analysis is for p,",00:59:17.670,00:59:21.440
can do the same for q.,00:59:21.440,00:59:26.550
"It's exactly the same,
because p is a prime",00:59:26.550,00:59:29.250
and q is also a prime.,00:59:29.250,00:59:31.710
"But I have to just do one last
thing, which is put these two",00:59:31.710,00:59:34.910
"things together and say
that n equals p times q,",00:59:34.910,00:59:39.130
"so the math is all
going to work out.",00:59:39.130,00:59:41.446
Let me just write that out.,00:59:41.446,00:59:42.570
"It's not too
difficult to explain,",00:59:42.570,00:59:45.740
once I have this up here.,00:59:45.740,00:59:47.750
"So in both cases of p and
q, so when I say both cases,",00:59:47.750,00:59:52.100
I mean the pk's and qk's.,00:59:52.100,00:59:55.330
"I have m raised to
ed equals m mod p.",00:59:55.330,01:00:02.070
"And m raised to ed is
the same as m mod q.",01:00:02.070,01:00:09.320
"And since p and q
are distinct primes,",01:00:09.320,01:00:19.810
"we can say that m raised
to ed equals m mod N.",01:00:19.810,01:00:27.690
"And that essentially says c
raised to d, if you really",01:00:27.690,01:00:31.410
"want to put it all
together, which",01:00:31.410,01:00:33.000
"is m raised to e raised to
d, equals m mod N, which",01:00:33.000,01:00:41.590
of course is what we want here.,01:00:41.590,01:00:45.530
"And this thing was also mod N.
This is mod N, mod N, mod N.",01:00:45.530,01:00:51.000
All right.,01:00:51.000,01:00:52.270
So that's RSA.,01:00:52.270,01:00:53.090
"That's your first
public key algorithm,",01:00:53.090,01:00:55.400
"the first public key
algorithm, at least",01:00:55.400,01:00:57.560
"that stood the test of
time, still in use today.",01:00:57.560,01:01:00.075
"From a standpoint
of computation,",01:01:03.900,01:01:06.430
this is the hardest part.,01:01:06.430,01:01:09.670
"You have to exponentiate, and
you have these large numbers.",01:01:09.670,01:01:12.900
"And as the years have rolled
by, RSA, as I've said,",01:01:12.900,01:01:19.000
withstood the test of time.,01:01:19.000,01:01:20.400
"But the parameters
have increased.",01:01:20.400,01:01:23.140
"Way back then in
the '70s, they were",01:01:23.140,01:01:25.210
thinking about 512-bit primes.,01:01:25.210,01:01:28.960
"In fact, I can't recall
whether n was 512-bits or p",01:01:28.960,01:01:32.060
and q were 512-bits.,01:01:32.060,01:01:33.440
"But if p and q were 512-bits,
then n would be 1024.",01:01:33.440,01:01:36.940
"And now, NSA recommends
8192-bits for n.",01:01:36.940,01:01:43.330
So there's been an increase.,01:01:43.330,01:01:44.660
"But the nice thing
is that it's not",01:01:44.660,01:01:46.870
"like there's an exponential
increase in the computation.",01:01:46.870,01:01:52.040
"Because the computation
is polynomially related",01:01:52.040,01:01:55.910
to the number of bits.,01:01:55.910,01:01:57.570
"So if you double it, I
think, if I recall correctly,",01:01:57.570,01:02:01.560
"decryption is going to
be the cube of that.",01:02:01.560,01:02:04.430
"Or actually,
verifying signatures",01:02:04.430,01:02:06.370
is probably the cube of that.,01:02:06.370,01:02:07.820
"But don't worry too
much about that.",01:02:07.820,01:02:11.470
"The bottom line is
that as you double",01:02:11.470,01:02:15.950
"the size of the
exponent, you're going",01:02:15.950,01:02:18.050
"to have a fairly small
increase in the time required",01:02:18.050,01:02:22.530
"to decrypt or to verify
a signature, et cetera.",01:02:22.530,01:02:26.460
"But it has grown from
512 or 1024 to 8192.",01:02:26.460,01:02:32.270
"And so hopefully,
you all understand",01:02:32.270,01:02:35.160
how RSA works to some extent.,01:02:35.160,01:02:38.340
"I just will leave it at the
hardness assumptions here",01:02:38.340,01:02:44.270
"are, like in the case of
Diffie-Hellman, two-fold.",01:02:44.270,01:02:50.050
"And the first one is kind
of immediately obvious.",01:02:50.050,01:02:56.170
"Just like it was the
case with Diffie-Hellman,",01:02:56.170,01:02:58.550
"where you had g raised
to a flying about",01:02:58.550,01:03:01.390
"and obviously that
has to hide a,",01:03:01.390,01:03:04.130
"here you got N, capital
N, being published.",01:03:04.130,01:03:08.130
"And if anybody could
take N and factor it,",01:03:08.130,01:03:12.039
"there may be multiple
factorizations.",01:03:12.039,01:03:13.580
"But you're going to get a
unique prime factorization.",01:03:13.580,01:03:16.660
"So that's what you want, that
unique prime factorization",01:03:16.660,01:03:19.240
of N.,01:03:19.240,01:03:20.250
"And if you get that, then
you've broken the System",01:03:20.250,01:03:24.830
"because you know
what p and q are.",01:03:24.830,01:03:27.180
"And so this is all
public in the sense",01:03:27.180,01:03:28.960
that this algorithm is public.,01:03:28.960,01:03:31.120
"If you're using RSA, this
is what you're following.",01:03:31.120,01:03:33.559
"So the person is
trying to figure out",01:03:33.559,01:03:35.100
"what the two primes are
that together get multiplied",01:03:35.100,01:03:38.170
"to form capital N. And so
that's a factorization problem.",01:03:38.170,01:03:42.030
"And so RSA hardness
assumptions are given N,",01:03:42.030,01:03:52.300
"hard to factor into p, comma q.",01:03:52.300,01:03:59.230
And this is factoring.,01:03:59.230,01:04:00.315
"And then one other
thing, which is",01:04:03.740,01:04:06.480
"given e-- so you're
not actually breaking",01:04:06.480,01:04:09.320
the entire cryptosystem.,01:04:09.320,01:04:11.130
"But you're breaking
the privacy associated",01:04:11.130,01:04:14.860
with a particular message.,01:04:14.860,01:04:17.680

what p and q are.",01:04:23.370,01:04:27.830
"But you know that e is
relatively prime with respect",01:04:27.830,01:04:34.260
"to p minus 1, q minus 1,
because that's RSA algorithm.",01:04:34.260,01:04:38.680
And that's a publicly known.,01:04:38.680,01:04:40.480
"And you also know c, which
is the ciphered text.",01:04:40.480,01:04:45.030
"And so what you're doing is
you're trying to discover m.",01:04:45.030,01:04:47.520
"So you're trying to break a
particular encryption that was",01:04:47.520,01:04:50.780
created by the RSA algorithm.,01:04:50.780,01:04:53.520

building cryptosystems",01:09:31.770,01:09:33.880
based on 3-colorability.,01:09:33.880,01:09:35.210

simpler problem than all",01:09:35.210,01:09:38.380

you have out there.",01:09:40.609,01:09:42.490
OK.,01:09:42.490,01:09:43.250

perfectly reasonable question",01:09:43.250,01:09:47.550
to ask.,01:09:47.550,01:09:48.560
And then we have Knapsack.,01:09:48.560,01:09:51.370
"Knapsack is simply you've
got a bunch of items",01:09:51.370,01:09:55.850
"and you just want to
figure out whether you",01:09:55.850,01:09:59.290
"can get this particular sum
S. Knapsack is NPC as well.",01:09:59.290,01:10:06.940
"And you got a bunch of
weights given to you.",01:10:11.620,01:10:14.110
"And the BI are going
to have to be 0, 1.",01:10:14.110,01:10:17.350
"So you just want to discover
a particular assignment",01:10:17.350,01:10:20.740
"of the BIs, such that you pick
the appropriate items to put",01:10:20.740,01:10:24.770
"into the knapsack, right?",01:10:24.770,01:10:26.350
That's it.,01:10:26.350,01:10:27.110
"That's a perfectly
reasonable problem",01:10:27.110,01:10:29.830
"to potentially use as a basis
for computational hardness",01:10:29.830,01:10:33.760

They tried and they tried.,01:10:38.940,01:10:40.670

"based on Knapsack
that look fantastic.",01:10:43.770,01:10:48.350
"And they work from a

"in the sense that you
would use this Knapsack--",01:10:50.970,01:10:53.609
"and I'll give you
a sense of how this",01:10:53.609,01:10:55.150
"is done in a minute--
problem to encrypt.",01:10:55.150,01:11:01.390
"And then you'd use a different
kind of Knapsack problem",01:11:01.390,01:11:03.830
to decrypt.,01:11:03.830,01:11:05.260
"And when you encrypt
it and decrypt it,",01:11:05.260,01:11:07.240
"you did get that
same message back,",01:11:07.240,01:11:09.100
"except the whole world
knew what the message was.",01:11:09.100,01:11:11.720
"Because the problem
associated with the Knapsack",01:11:11.720,01:11:15.810
wasn't hard enough.,01:11:15.810,01:11:17.760
"So the computational
hardness was what",01:11:17.760,01:11:20.540
broke the Knapsack schemes.,01:11:20.540,01:11:22.660
"And then you come
down to asking why",01:11:22.660,01:11:25.680
"is it that this problem
that's not an NPC",01:11:25.680,01:11:31.820
"seems to have stood
the test of time,",01:11:31.820,01:11:34.310
"but all these other
problems, like Knapsack",01:11:34.310,01:11:36.850

is even worse than Knapsack,",01:11:36.850,01:11:39.790

is, sort of at a high level?",01:11:47.210,01:11:54.340

you're going to be",01:12:23.080,01:12:25.790

the graph-- and you",01:12:49.740,01:12:51.770
need this graph to be large.,01:12:51.770,01:12:53.020

"Because so what if
it's exponential?",01:12:55.871,01:12:57.370
It's constant time.,01:12:57.370,01:12:58.450

away from the rest of this,",01:13:35.030,01:13:37.530

true for Knapsack.",01:13:57.600,01:14:02.290
So that's the essence of it.,01:14:02.290,01:14:05.000
I'll just give you a sense.,01:14:05.000,01:14:07.450

That is kind of cool.,01:14:47.490,01:14:49.140
"You get a sense of the variety

"cryptosystems that are out there

is very different from RSA.,01:14:54.760,01:14:57.180
"So in the Knapsack problem,
the general Knapsack problem,",01:14:59.940,01:15:12.140
what's hard is NPC.,01:15:12.140,01:15:14.720

"Well, a super
increasing knapsack",01:15:31.960,01:15:34.140
"is something where I
Wj has this property.",01:15:34.140,01:15:45.460
"So an example of that
is 2, 3, 6, 13, 27, 52.",01:15:45.460,01:15:55.074

super increasing.",01:15:55.074,01:15:56.490

"I got a limit on

in terms of our definition.,01:16:19.120,01:16:20.900

super increasing knapsack?",01:16:20.900,01:16:25.650
Yep.,01:16:25.650,01:16:26.893
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
from the biggest",01:16:26.893,01:16:29.258

SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Exactly.,01:16:30.857,01:16:31.940
"That means that there's a
linear time algorithm that",01:16:31.940,01:16:33.880
basically solves the problem.,01:16:33.880,01:16:35.300
"And you know that
you can do that,",01:16:35.300,01:16:38.730

the correct answer.",01:16:38.730,01:16:40.850
"So that's pretty
much what you've got.",01:16:40.850,01:16:42.840
"That'll give you
the highest weight.",01:16:42.840,01:16:45.710
"If you have 13 exactly, you
know you can't put 52 and 27.",01:16:45.710,01:16:49.100
You get 13.,01:16:49.100,01:16:50.170
"There's no point in
putting 2 and 3 and 6,",01:16:50.170,01:16:52.580
"because that's not
going to give you 13.",01:16:52.580,01:16:56.400
So that's clearly easy.,01:16:56.400,01:16:57.920
"So we've got an
interesting case here,",01:16:57.920,01:17:00.827

going to work out",01:17:00.827,01:17:02.410
"from an adversarial standpoint,

I want encryption to be",01:17:05.670,01:17:09.920
the super increasing knapsack.,01:17:09.920,01:17:12.070
"Because that should
be easy to do.",01:17:12.070,01:17:14.730
"And I want the decryption,
not knowing the private key,",01:17:14.730,01:17:21.630
to be as hard as knapsack.,01:17:21.630,01:17:23.580
OK.,01:17:23.580,01:17:24.250
"So that's the kind of
thing that you could",01:17:24.250,01:17:25.999
do if you built a cryptosystem.,01:17:25.999,01:17:29.550
"And people did,
Merkle and Hellman.",01:17:29.550,01:17:31.550
"Hellman is the same guy, the
second name, in Diffie-Hellman.",01:17:31.550,01:17:34.600

system that ended up",01:17:34.600,01:17:38.970
being broken soon after.,01:17:38.970,01:17:40.830
"But the idea is that you
create a private key.",01:17:40.830,01:17:43.410
"And the private key is a
super increasing knapsack.",01:17:46.150,01:17:48.645
"And then you use a
private transform in order",01:17:54.980,01:18:03.570
"to get a-- and this is
really I put it in quotes,",01:18:03.570,01:18:08.270
"because this was the bug--
""hard"" Knapsack problem.",01:18:08.270,01:18:14.725
"And this corresponded
to the public key.",01:18:17.650,01:18:21.010
"And so what you do
is you won't actually",01:18:25.500,01:18:27.860
"have to solve Knapsack for
encryption, the hard problem.",01:18:27.860,01:18:32.459
"The encryption would
just simply take",01:18:32.459,01:18:34.000
"the public key, which
is completely public,",01:18:34.000,01:18:36.810
"and you would create
the encryption",01:18:36.810,01:18:41.120
"of a message using this
particular public key",01:18:41.120,01:18:45.450
in a polynomial time.,01:18:45.450,01:18:49.680
"But the inversion, not
knowing the private key,",01:18:49.680,01:18:54.830
"you would force the
adversary to solve",01:18:54.830,01:18:57.820
"what you think was hard
general Knapsack problem",01:18:57.820,01:19:00.050
"to actually break the scheme
or to get the decryption.",01:19:00.050,01:19:03.920
"And so let me show you
really quickly how this",01:19:03.920,01:19:07.210
works with numbers.,01:19:07.210,01:19:08.230
"And we won't have you worry
about symbols and things",01:19:08.230,01:19:11.850
like that.,01:19:11.850,01:19:12.820
"So just give me a couple
of extra minutes here.",01:19:12.820,01:19:16.924
"So let's say that
I had a message.",01:19:16.924,01:19:18.340
"Oh, before I do that, let
me look at-- let's say,",01:19:22.310,01:19:26.960
"that we chose N equals
31 and M equals 105.",01:19:26.960,01:19:31.200
This is actually the message.,01:19:31.200,01:19:32.750
"No, I'm sorry.",01:19:36.520,01:19:37.950
Capital M is not the message.,01:19:37.950,01:19:39.260
These are public parameters.,01:19:39.260,01:19:43.150

this is a transform.",01:19:43.150,01:19:47.900
"Oh, I'm sorry.",01:19:52.037,01:19:52.620
These are not public.,01:19:52.620,01:19:53.660
These are private.,01:19:53.660,01:19:54.600
My bad.,01:19:54.600,01:19:57.210
"So what I'm going
to show you is I'm",01:19:57.210,01:19:58.710
"going to take a super
increasing Knapsack.",01:19:58.710,01:20:00.830
"And that's exactly
what I have up there.",01:20:00.830,01:20:02.620
"So that corresponds to
an easy Knapsack problem.",01:20:02.620,01:20:05.580

these private parameters,",01:20:05.580,01:20:09.540
N equals 31 and M equals 105.,01:20:09.540,01:20:12.480
"And so our private key is our
super increasing knapsack,",01:20:12.480,01:20:17.310
"which is 2, 3, 6,
13, 27, and 52.",01:20:17.310,01:20:23.720
"And the public key,
what I'm going to do",01:20:23.720,01:20:29.920
"is simply multiply each
of these, 2 times N.",01:20:29.920,01:20:37.310
"And I'm going to take mod M.
So for each of those values,",01:20:37.310,01:20:42.950
"I multiplied by N, which is
31, and take the mod of 105,",01:20:42.950,01:20:46.560
"and I end up getting 62,
93, 81, 88, 102, and 37.",01:20:46.560,01:20:55.480
"So you can get a private
key and a public key",01:20:55.480,01:21:01.250
using this private transform.,01:21:01.250,01:21:03.649
I'll let you look at the notes.,01:21:03.649,01:21:04.940
"But basically what
happens is when",01:21:04.940,01:21:06.550
"you take a particular
message M, what you end up",01:21:06.550,01:21:10.030
"doing is you want to encrypt
it using the public key, which",01:21:10.030,01:21:13.680
is this quantity over here.,01:21:13.680,01:21:15.690
"And the way you
encrypt that is simply",01:21:15.690,01:21:18.860
by taking a particular message.,01:21:18.860,01:21:22.090
"And let's say that the
message is written as 011000.",01:21:22.090,01:21:26.770
"Then all you do is
add up 93 and 81,",01:21:26.770,01:21:30.880
because those are those two.,01:21:30.880,01:21:32.440
"And you say this is going
to get encrypted by 174.",01:21:32.440,01:21:37.200
"So the message
encryption is simply",01:21:37.200,01:21:39.500
"a simple operation where you
add up weights of the knapsack.",01:21:39.500,01:21:43.430
"So you end up
getting 174 out here.",01:21:43.430,01:21:46.320
"And the hope is, of course,
that when adversary sees 174--",01:21:46.320,01:21:52.250
"and this is the part where
things get a little iffy--",01:21:52.250,01:21:58.030
"that it's hard-- you have to
think about lots of numbers",01:21:58.030,01:22:00.990
"here, of course--
for the adversary",01:22:00.990,01:22:03.520
"to figure out that that
174 is actually 93 plus 81.",01:22:03.520,01:22:08.610
OK.,01:22:08.610,01:22:10.490
"So the diverse is not
necessarily an easy problem.",01:22:10.490,01:22:14.470
"And that's exactly what
Knapsack is, right?",01:22:14.470,01:22:16.400
"I tell you what the sum
is over there, which is S.",01:22:16.400,01:22:19.840
"And I tell you what
the weights are.",01:22:19.840,01:22:21.710
"And it's hard for you to
figure out what the BIs are.",01:22:21.710,01:22:24.950
"So now you see why
this didn't work.",01:22:24.950,01:22:28.550
"So you have to have
a situation where",01:22:28.550,01:22:31.650
"in the average case whatever you
produce for the ciphered text",01:22:31.650,01:22:35.850
"here, you're sending out
the ciphered text according",01:22:35.850,01:22:38.685
"to this cryptosystem,
which is 174,",01:22:38.685,01:22:41.140
"and you want to make sure that
the adversary can't figure out",01:22:41.140,01:22:45.390
"that this is
actually 93 plus 81.",01:22:45.390,01:22:47.830
"Amazingly, people thought
they could build systems",01:22:47.830,01:22:50.480
"using this assuming
these numbers were",01:22:50.480,01:22:52.770
much larger than they are here.,01:22:52.770,01:22:54.500
"But that certainly
wasn't the case.",01:22:54.500,01:22:57.220
"Because in the average
case, you end up",01:22:57.220,01:22:59.450
"being able to break
these systems.",01:22:59.450,01:23:01.590
"The last thing
is, of course, you",01:23:01.590,01:23:03.860
"don't want to necessarily
solve the hard Knapsack",01:23:03.860,01:23:06.250
problem associated with this.,01:23:06.250,01:23:10.420
"So what ends up happening is
you end up using N equals 31.",01:23:10.420,01:23:16.330
"So if you want to decrypt,
you have N equals 31",01:23:16.330,01:23:19.470
and M equals 105.,01:23:19.470,01:23:21.620
"And what you're going to do
is take this and multiply it",01:23:21.620,01:23:25.240
by N inverse mod M.,01:23:25.240,01:23:30.270
"So rather than doing times N
mod M, you divide by N mod M.",01:23:30.270,01:23:37.200
"And you can do this
operation relatively simply.",01:23:37.200,01:23:40.720
"And you can go back
from 174 to figuring out",01:23:40.720,01:23:46.810
"what the actual message was
by computing this quantity.",01:23:46.810,01:23:52.770
So I'll stop there.,01:23:52.770,01:23:54.280
"I didn't quite get to everything
that I wanted to cover.",01:23:54.280,01:23:56.720
But take a look at the notes.,01:23:56.720,01:23:58.460
"Get a sense for why
the difference exists",01:23:58.460,01:24:01.950
"between NP-complete
problems and problems that",01:24:01.950,01:24:04.500
were used in cryptosystems.,01:24:04.500,01:24:06.260
"And happy to stick around
and answer questions.",01:24:06.260,01:24:10.100
