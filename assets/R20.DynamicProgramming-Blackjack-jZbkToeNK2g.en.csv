pointed questions",00:00:21.587,00:00:23.170
before we go over blackjack?,00:00:23.170,00:00:26.455

you start blackjack",00:00:26.455,00:00:27.955
"can you go through
the rules again?",00:00:27.955,00:00:31.820

rules of the game?",00:00:31.820,00:00:33.240
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:00:33.240,00:00:33.823
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:00:33.823,00:00:34.680
"Well I'm going to
do something better",00:00:34.680,00:00:36.240
than going through the rules.,00:00:36.240,00:00:37.448
"I'm going to abstract
the rules away.",00:00:37.448,00:00:39.060
"So I'm going to say that
a game of blackjack has,",00:00:41.810,00:00:47.240
let's start here.,00:00:47.240,00:00:48.300
"So a game of
blackjack has a deck.",00:00:53.090,00:00:55.520
"And we have x-ray vision
or some other illegal way",00:00:55.520,00:01:00.590
"in which we know what the deck
looks like from the beginning.",00:01:00.590,00:01:04.640
How many cards in a deck?,00:01:04.640,00:01:06.103
AUDIENCE: 52.,00:01:06.103,00:01:06.950
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:01:06.950,00:01:08.380
"So say from 0 to 51 because
we like zero-based indexing.",00:01:08.380,00:01:12.455
"So the way that the game
starts is you get two cards,",00:01:16.510,00:01:19.100
the dealer gets two cards.,00:01:19.100,00:01:20.640
"What is the only decision
that you make in the game",00:01:20.640,00:01:23.780
"if you already have
perfect information?",00:01:23.780,00:01:25.490
So you know the deck already.,00:01:28.622,00:01:29.830
"You don't need to
wait for each card",00:01:29.830,00:01:31.330
to know what it's going to be.,00:01:31.330,00:01:33.730
"So as the game starts you
have to make one decision.",00:01:33.730,00:01:37.890
What's that decision?,00:01:37.890,00:01:40.232
AUDIENCE: Hit or stand.,00:01:40.232,00:01:41.190
"PROFESSOR: Well
that's assuming you",00:01:41.190,00:01:42.970
care what you get each time.,00:01:42.970,00:01:45.404
"So if you have to
look at the card",00:01:45.404,00:01:46.820
"then you have to decide each
time if you hit or stand.",00:01:46.820,00:01:49.300
"If you know all the
cards in advance--",00:01:49.300,00:01:51.100
AUDIENCE: How much to bet?,00:01:51.100,00:01:53.750
"PROFESSOR: I think our
game has that fixed.",00:01:53.750,00:01:55.967
AUDIENCE: When to restart?,00:01:55.967,00:01:57.050
"PROFESSOR: So it
is hit or stand,",00:01:57.050,00:01:59.300
but I want to restate that.,00:01:59.300,00:02:01.120
"Because you don't actually
have to decide after every card",00:02:01.120,00:02:03.560

are going to be in advance.",00:02:05.195,00:02:07.320
AUDIENCE: When to restart?,00:02:07.320,00:02:08.984
Like how many cards to pick?,00:02:08.984,00:02:10.150
"PROFESSOR: How
many cards to pick.",00:02:10.150,00:02:12.290
"Yeah that's pretty
much the same thing.",00:02:12.290,00:02:13.954
"So you don't have to decide
every time hit or stand,",00:02:13.954,00:02:16.120
"you know ahead of time I
want to hit three times,",00:02:16.120,00:02:18.161
or I want to hit once.,00:02:18.161,00:02:19.255
"Because you know
the entire deck.",00:02:19.255,00:02:20.630
"You don't need to actually
look at the cards.",00:02:20.630,00:02:23.540
"So each game the only
decision that I make is--",00:02:23.540,00:02:28.317
"suppose this is one
game-- the only decision",00:02:28.317,00:02:30.150
"that I have is h, how many
cards I'm going to hit.",00:02:30.150,00:02:34.880
Right?,00:02:34.880,00:02:36.060
"And then after I
make this decision",00:02:36.060,00:02:40.660
the game will eat up some cards.,00:02:40.660,00:02:42.360
"I get two cards, the
dealer gets two cards,",00:02:42.360,00:02:44.380
"then I hit some cards then
the dealer gets some cards.",00:02:44.380,00:02:47.320
"And this is the number of
cards that have been consumed.",00:02:47.320,00:02:51.950
"Some number of cards that
were played in this game.",00:02:51.950,00:02:58.930
"And the other thing
that comes out of it",00:02:58.930,00:03:00.730
is how much money I make.,00:03:00.730,00:03:03.090
"For our simple rules it's
either I make $1, or nothing,",00:03:03.090,00:03:08.510
or I lose $1.,00:03:08.510,00:03:10.026
Fair enough?,00:03:13.840,00:03:14.730
Everyone follows?,00:03:14.730,00:03:16.430
"So I'm going to abstract
all this in a helper method.",00:03:16.430,00:03:20.800
"I'm going to say that I have
a method called round outcome.",00:03:20.800,00:03:24.580
"Where I say, look out
of the entire deck",00:03:29.960,00:03:32.470
"I'm going to start at card i, so
this is where my round starts.",00:03:32.470,00:03:37.070
"So I tell it which
cards I start at.",00:03:37.070,00:03:39.430
"And how many cards
I'm going to hit.",00:03:39.430,00:03:41.820
"And it gives me back a
tuple, where the first item",00:03:41.820,00:03:45.400
is how many cards are played.,00:03:45.400,00:03:48.130
So number of cards played.,00:03:48.130,00:03:51.080
"And the second item in the tuple
is how much money do I make.",00:03:51.080,00:03:54.730
"h is how many cards
I'm going to hit.",00:04:07.080,00:04:09.130
"So i says that I already
played this many cards",00:04:09.130,00:04:12.050
in previous games.,00:04:12.050,00:04:14.910
"So a game starts
with a full deck.",00:04:14.910,00:04:17.660
And then I play some rounds.,00:04:17.660,00:04:20.529
"Each round I do a whole
exchange with the dealer, where",00:04:20.529,00:04:24.320
"I hit some cards, and then
the dealer hits some cards.",00:04:24.320,00:04:26.730
"And then I win or
lose some money.",00:04:26.730,00:04:30.930
"AUDIENCE: I don't understand
why h and cp are different.",00:04:30.930,00:04:33.719
"PROFESSOR: So cp is how many
cards are played in total.",00:04:33.719,00:04:36.010
"And this looks at
the initial cards.",00:04:36.010,00:04:38.880
"So first I get two cards,
the dealer gets two cards.",00:04:38.880,00:04:42.050
"And then after I hit some cards
the dealer also has to hit.",00:04:42.050,00:04:46.240
"And the dealer has a pretty
find algorithm, right?",00:04:46.240,00:04:49.410
"So the number of
cards played includes",00:04:49.410,00:04:51.240
"the cards that were
dealt initially",00:04:51.240,00:04:53.480
"and the cars that the
dealer has to hit.",00:04:53.480,00:04:56.360
"So this little thing has all the
blackjack rules encoded in it.",00:04:56.360,00:05:01.880
Everything is already there.,00:05:01.880,00:05:04.650
"AUDIENCE: So blackjack,
that's roughly 2h?",00:05:04.650,00:05:06.400
"cp is 2h, something like that?",00:05:06.400,00:05:09.620
PROFESSOR: 4 plus 2h maybe.,00:05:09.620,00:05:12.005
"Because you get two
cards, he gets two cards,",00:05:12.005,00:05:13.880
"and if you both deal
h on average then--",00:05:13.880,00:05:18.975
"AUDIENCE: So is cp the
number of cards this round?",00:05:18.975,00:05:21.480
"PROFESSOR: This round, yeah.",00:05:21.480,00:05:22.646
"OK so intuitively
I already know,",00:05:33.910,00:05:37.944
"so I already know
the entire deck.",00:05:37.944,00:05:39.360
"So the decision that
I have to make is,",00:05:39.360,00:05:43.450
"would I play
optimally every round?",00:05:43.450,00:05:45.590
"Or do I want to maybe
lose the first round",00:05:45.590,00:05:48.580
"and leave some good
cards for later?",00:05:48.580,00:05:51.620
"So I have to figure
out how many cards I'm",00:05:51.620,00:05:53.390
"going to hit each time so
that overall I make the most",00:05:53.390,00:05:56.560
"amount of money when
I leave the table.",00:05:56.560,00:05:58.530
"And when I run out of
cards I leave the table.",00:05:58.530,00:06:01.890
"The dealer says
shows over, gotta go.",00:06:01.890,00:06:04.770
Do the rules make sense?,00:06:07.890,00:06:11.220
"OK so I propose we
approach this in two ways.",00:06:11.220,00:06:14.650
"First we model it
as a graph problem,",00:06:14.650,00:06:16.427
"because we've already
done this a few times.",00:06:16.427,00:06:18.260
"And then we model it as a
dynamic programming problem.",00:06:18.260,00:06:20.580
"And we see how the
two are related.",00:06:20.580,00:06:23.630
Make sense?,00:06:23.630,00:06:25.110
Is this too simple for everyone?,00:06:25.110,00:06:26.820
You guys already get everything?,00:06:26.820,00:06:29.150
"So how would I model
this is a graph problem?",00:06:29.150,00:06:31.290
"AUDIENCE: Do you
already know the order",00:06:36.587,00:06:38.212
"that you're going to
get all these cards in?",00:06:38.212,00:06:40.117
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:06:40.117,00:06:41.370
"AUDIENCE: So I in
lecture we briefly",00:06:41.370,00:06:44.300
"talked about having
your starting node go",00:06:44.300,00:06:47.220
"to a bunch of other
nodes that would",00:06:47.220,00:06:51.940
"be your potential
next move, and then",00:06:51.940,00:06:55.096
"you just calculate your
shortest path distance",00:06:55.096,00:06:57.012
from there to the x value.,00:06:57.012,00:06:58.940
"PROFESSOR: So that's
the general approach.",00:06:58.940,00:07:02.320
How do we do this for cards?,00:07:02.320,00:07:03.980
So what would be nodes?,00:07:03.980,00:07:05.210
"What are the most intuitive
nodes you could think about?",00:07:05.210,00:07:10.580
OK maybe intuitive for me.,00:07:13.260,00:07:16.880
"So nodes show our state, right?",00:07:16.880,00:07:18.640
"Show the state that the
game is currently in.",00:07:18.640,00:07:22.014
Sorry?,00:07:22.014,00:07:22.514
AUDIENCE: Your hand.,00:07:22.514,00:07:23.490
Like your current cards.,00:07:23.490,00:07:25.760
Is that your state?,00:07:25.760,00:07:28.190
So from I guess 2 to ace.,00:07:30.694,00:07:34.040
PROFESSOR: From?,00:07:34.040,00:07:35.910
"AUDIENCE: From 2 to ace, in
terms of the number of choices",00:07:35.910,00:07:38.860
you have.,00:07:38.860,00:07:39.360
"PROFESSOR: OK so
the problem is you",00:07:39.360,00:07:41.860
"have four cards of
each type, right?",00:07:41.860,00:07:44.122
"And you don't know where
they show up and everything.",00:07:44.122,00:07:46.330
"So I think this my code
more complicated than it",00:07:46.330,00:07:49.380
needs to be.,00:07:49.380,00:07:50.854
"AUDIENCE: Like the rest
of the cards in the deck",00:07:50.854,00:07:52.916
that are remaining?,00:07:52.916,00:07:53.310
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:07:53.310,00:07:54.155
"AUDIENCE: Is that
a good [INAUDIBLE]?",00:07:54.155,00:07:55.750
"PROFESSOR: How many cars I
have left in the deck, right?",00:07:55.750,00:07:58.630
"So basically I would have one
node for each of the cards",00:07:58.630,00:08:03.460
here.,00:08:03.460,00:08:04.320
"And that says I start a
new game at this card.",00:08:04.320,00:08:07.650
"OK so I'm going to
draw some circles.",00:08:12.130,00:08:15.960
Say these are our nodes.,00:08:21.970,00:08:24.450
"Maybe I draw a bit
too many of them.",00:08:24.450,00:08:26.390
Where do we always start?,00:08:26.390,00:08:30.291
AUDIENCE: The left side.,00:08:30.291,00:08:31.290
"PROFESSOR: First one, right?",00:08:31.290,00:08:32.456
We start with 52 cards.,00:08:32.456,00:08:33.940
"So circle 0 means that we played
0 cards, we have 52 cards left.",00:08:33.940,00:08:41.570
"When do we draw an
edge between nodes?",00:08:41.570,00:08:44.362
What does an edge mean?,00:08:44.362,00:08:45.320
"AUDIENCE: That's how
many cards you've chosen,",00:08:48.204,00:08:50.120
so the number cp.,00:08:50.120,00:08:53.810
PROFESSOR: OK so the number cp.,00:08:53.810,00:08:55.710
"It means I played a game, right?",00:08:55.710,00:08:58.580
So one edge is a game.,00:08:58.580,00:09:00.220
"And it goes from one
state to the next state.",00:09:00.220,00:09:03.610
"So if I'm, say I'm at node i.",00:09:03.610,00:09:06.990
How do I draw the edges?,00:09:10.880,00:09:13.360
Say I'm somewhere here.,00:09:13.360,00:09:14.770
So I already played i cards.,00:09:14.770,00:09:17.814
"AUDIENCE: Iterate
through all h's, cp's.",00:09:17.814,00:09:19.480
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:09:19.480,00:09:20.850
So for h in what to what?,00:09:20.850,00:09:25.082
What's the smallest h?,00:09:25.082,00:09:27.610
AUDIENCE: The smallest h is 1.,00:09:27.610,00:09:29.992
PROFESSOR: Really?,00:09:29.992,00:09:31.430
Do I have to hit?,00:09:31.430,00:09:34.905
AUDIENCE: Wait isn't it 4?,00:09:34.905,00:09:36.390
"Because you're
always dealing out 4.",00:09:36.390,00:09:38.145
"PROFESSOR: Yes, so I might as
well not count them, right?",00:09:38.145,00:09:40.520
"So h is how many cards I hit
after the initial ones were",00:09:40.520,00:09:43.790
dealt.,00:09:43.790,00:09:46.050
"So that I can start at 0,
a nice and easy number.",00:09:46.050,00:09:49.340
And where do I end?,00:09:49.340,00:09:50.542
Rough approximation.,00:09:50.542,00:09:51.375
"AUDIENCE: You could go to
infinity and then break.",00:09:54.900,00:09:58.060
"It's still 11 because 11 at
most-- oh no, 11 minus 4, 6.",00:09:58.060,00:10:02.200
"You need to know the
rules of the game.",00:10:02.200,00:10:03.990
"PROFESSOR: OK if you know the
rules of the game it's that.",00:10:03.990,00:10:05.320
"If you don't know the rules
of the game it's 52 minus i.",00:10:05.320,00:10:08.071
OK so what's first thing I do?,00:10:12.220,00:10:15.200
"So how do I draw an
edge representing",00:10:15.200,00:10:16.940
a game where I hold h cards?,00:10:16.940,00:10:18.570
"AUDIENCE: So you draw an
edge from your current place",00:10:23.420,00:10:28.550
"to the output of round
outcome with the 0 element.",00:10:28.550,00:10:32.800
"PROFESSOR: So then let's
store this output somewhere.",00:10:36.472,00:10:38.680
Let's say o is round outcome.,00:10:38.680,00:10:45.220
What do I give round outcome?,00:10:45.220,00:10:49.540
AUDIENCE: i and h.,00:10:49.540,00:10:54.392
"PROFESSOR: See I
picked good names.",00:10:54.392,00:10:55.850
"They're exactly
what I have there.",00:10:55.850,00:10:57.620
"So I draw an edge
from i to what?",00:10:57.620,00:10:59.520
"AUDIENCE: To the output of
round outcome, which is o.",00:11:02.388,00:11:06.900
So it's 0.,00:11:06.900,00:11:08.397
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:11:08.397,00:11:08.980
"AUDIENCE: Or that
the node at o is 0.",00:11:12.604,00:11:14.574
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:11:14.574,00:11:15.240
"So suppose I'm at i
and I've already played",00:11:18.740,00:11:20.890
"five cards, right?",00:11:20.890,00:11:22.520
"So say i equals 5, for example.",00:11:22.520,00:11:26.050
"And I know that if I hit
once the dealer will also",00:11:26.050,00:11:31.340
have to hit once.,00:11:31.340,00:11:32.100
So in total I've played 6 cards.,00:11:32.100,00:11:35.250
And suppose I won.,00:11:35.250,00:11:39.310
"Then the output
would look like this.",00:11:39.310,00:11:42.280
6 cards were played and I won.,00:11:42.280,00:11:44.520
So plus 1.,00:11:44.520,00:11:47.040
"So I would draw an
edge from 5 to what?",00:11:47.040,00:11:51.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:11:51.800,00:11:53.480
"PROFESSOR: OK, from
5 to 11 hopefully.",00:11:53.480,00:11:58.480
So what's 11?,00:11:58.480,00:12:00.930
11 is 5 plus all of 0.,00:12:00.930,00:12:07.490
"OK, what am I missing there?",00:12:07.490,00:12:09.950
"AUDIENCE: i to i
plus [INAUDIBLE].",00:12:15.300,00:12:17.925
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:12:17.925,00:12:18.550
"So this tells me how many
cards I played in this game.",00:12:25.870,00:12:31.230
"I want to look at
each game separately.",00:12:31.230,00:12:33.140
"I don't want to have to keep
track of previous states.",00:12:33.140,00:12:36.200
"So this output is
localized to this game.",00:12:36.200,00:12:38.770
"It tells me how
many cards have been",00:12:38.770,00:12:40.720
drawn in this game in total.,00:12:40.720,00:12:42.620
"And how much money
I made in this game.",00:12:42.620,00:12:45.310
"If I already played i cards
before starting the game,",00:12:45.310,00:12:50.200
"after I play all of 0, the total
number of cards is i plus 0.",00:12:50.200,00:12:55.550
"Tiny detail, but you'd
probably lose a point off",00:12:55.550,00:12:57.720
"of an exam or something
if you forget it.",00:12:57.720,00:13:00.680
OK so keep track of your state.,00:13:00.680,00:13:02.000
"It makes sense to write
down this is my state,",00:13:02.000,00:13:05.170
"and then make sure that
you're always representing it.",00:13:05.170,00:13:07.920
So what's the cost of the edge?,00:13:07.920,00:13:09.310
"And then our answer would
be what path do I want?",00:13:20.520,00:13:25.120
"I want to make the
most amount of money,",00:13:28.270,00:13:30.400
so that's the longest path.,00:13:30.400,00:13:32.600
"How do I convert this to
a shortest path problem,",00:13:32.600,00:13:34.730
"because this is what
you know how to solve?",00:13:34.730,00:13:37.950
Where I put it?,00:13:37.950,00:13:40.084
AUDIENCE: There.,00:13:40.084,00:13:42.530
"PROFESSOR: Good answer, there.",00:13:42.530,00:13:44.060
Right there.,00:13:44.060,00:13:46.010
"OK so this builds
the graph, then",00:13:46.010,00:13:48.300
I run some algorithm on it.,00:13:48.300,00:13:50.810
"What's the best algorithm
I can run on it?",00:13:50.810,00:13:55.210
"AUDIENCE: Dykstra because
you can [INAUDIBLE].",00:13:55.210,00:13:59.090
But you can add everything on.,00:13:59.090,00:14:01.450
"The lowest negative edge
weight is 1, or negative 1.",00:14:01.450,00:14:05.518
"PROFESSOR: Are there
negative cycles?",00:14:09.825,00:14:11.734
AUDIENCE: No.,00:14:11.734,00:14:13.694
"PROFESSOR: Everything
goes right, right?",00:14:13.694,00:14:15.360
"So even if I don't
get hit any card,",00:14:15.360,00:14:18.130
"at least four cards
will be played.",00:14:18.130,00:14:19.620
So all these arrows go right.,00:14:19.620,00:14:22.400
"So then I heard a
fancy term that I like.",00:14:26.550,00:14:29.230
Can someone say it again?,00:14:32.279,00:14:33.320
What's this graph?,00:14:33.320,00:14:35.250
AUDIENCE: DAG.,00:14:35.250,00:14:36.190
PROFESSOR: DAG.,00:14:36.190,00:14:37.170
All the edges go one way.,00:14:37.170,00:14:38.670
So this is a DAG.,00:14:38.670,00:14:41.030
"And that means that I
can run what algorithm?",00:14:41.030,00:14:43.385
Sorry?,00:14:47.130,00:14:49.044
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:14:49.044,00:14:50.880
"PROFESSOR: Topological
sort plus DFS,",00:14:50.880,00:14:52.570
"the one that we talked about
last time when everyone was out",00:14:52.570,00:14:55.080
for Thanksgiving.,00:14:55.080,00:14:56.365
"So you have to
believe me that it",00:14:56.365,00:14:57.740
"exists, or look
at lecture notes.",00:14:57.740,00:15:00.850
"So top sort plus

"the shortest path in
order of V plus E.",00:15:05.180,00:15:10.000

"OK I'm guessing
most of you don't",00:15:19.930,00:15:21.790
know how that algorithm works.,00:15:21.790,00:15:23.040

we're going to do",00:15:23.040,00:15:24.415
this using dynamic programming.,00:15:24.415,00:15:25.860
"So we're going to represent
the graph implicitly.",00:15:25.860,00:15:28.622
"And we're going to
write everything",00:15:28.622,00:15:30.080
"without needing to
know the algorithm.",00:15:30.080,00:15:33.270
"If you know it, it helps because
you can see how they relate.",00:15:33.270,00:15:35.860
"But if you don't we should still
be able to solve the problem.",00:15:35.860,00:15:39.800

everyone understand this?",00:15:39.800,00:15:42.900

number 5 there,",00:15:58.740,00:16:00.700
"that's only if you hit, right?",00:16:00.700,00:16:03.070
"Or that's the number
of cards remaining.",00:16:03.070,00:16:06.070
"Is there a particular
reason you picked 5?",00:16:06.070,00:16:09.054
"PROFESSOR: So I was
choosing an example for i.",00:16:09.054,00:16:10.970
"So good question,
what does i mean?",00:16:10.970,00:16:13.160
"So this means I'm-- assume
that I'm starting a game.",00:16:15.840,00:16:20.130
"So starting-- sorry, a round.",00:16:20.130,00:16:22.778
A new round.,00:16:26.770,00:16:27.380
"And I have already played i
cards in the previous round.",00:16:27.380,00:16:36.400
"So I started a new round
and the first 5 cards",00:16:44.590,00:16:48.120
are out of the deck.,00:16:48.120,00:16:49.960
"What's the best
strategy I can have?",00:16:49.960,00:16:51.510
"What's the most
money I can make?",00:16:51.510,00:16:53.273
"AUDIENCE: But there's
some nodes that",00:16:53.273,00:16:55.125
"connect to the next card
over that won't necessarily",00:16:55.125,00:16:58.050

there aren't going",00:16:58.050,00:16:59.972
"to be any earnings, right?",00:16:59.972,00:17:01.326
"You could have 5 connect
to 6, and that wouldn't--",00:17:04.470,00:17:06.901
"PROFESSOR: Here I'm just
trying to emphasize the point",00:17:06.901,00:17:09.150
"that all the edges move,
all the edges point forward.",00:17:09.150,00:17:12.700
"But yeah, the edges have to
go at least across four nodes.",00:17:12.700,00:17:17.280
"So assume there are some
more nodes around here.",00:17:17.280,00:17:19.610
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:17:19.610,00:17:20.151
PROFESSOR: Yes?,00:17:23.099,00:17:23.768

saying how you",00:17:23.768,00:17:25.143
"have to be careful
with something",00:17:25.143,00:17:25.960
or else you'll lose a point.,00:17:25.960,00:17:27.430

"PROFESSOR: How you
draw your edges.",00:17:33.622,00:17:35.080
"Or when we switch to
dynamic programming, what",00:17:35.080,00:17:37.184
you write in your recursion.,00:17:37.184,00:17:38.350
"OK so last chance
to ask a question",00:17:43.620,00:17:45.320
"before we do a conceptual jump
and use another algorithm.",00:17:45.320,00:17:51.070
"OK how do we do this using
the dynamic programming?",00:18:01.520,00:18:04.474
"So what are we going to
have instead of nodes?",00:18:04.474,00:18:06.390
Sorry?,00:18:09.800,00:18:12.100
"Well so you still have
states in both cases.",00:18:12.100,00:18:14.790
"But here you represent
them with nodes in a graph.",00:18:14.790,00:18:18.400
"In dynamic programming you
represent them using-- yeah,",00:18:18.400,00:18:23.490
"the states are
basically sub-problems.",00:18:23.490,00:18:25.240
"And what do we, when we
compute stuff, what do we use?",00:18:25.240,00:18:29.850
"Numbers is a vector
or in a matrix.",00:18:34.750,00:18:37.030

graph to work with.",00:18:37.030,00:18:38.690
"There are no extra
algorithms to call.",00:18:38.690,00:18:40.710

"we trade the answers
to the problem.",00:18:43.020,00:18:45.430

How many elements in the array?,00:18:54.449,00:18:55.740
Can anyone guess?,00:18:55.740,00:18:58.960
"All right, I heard 52.",00:18:58.960,00:19:00.380
"If I'm at element i, say i
equals 5 because we used that",00:19:06.660,00:19:12.650

in the dynamic programming",00:19:12.650,00:19:17.041
formulation?,00:19:17.041,00:19:17.540
"It's very similar
to node 5 there.",00:19:20.260,00:19:23.940

a round after we've",00:19:32.252,00:19:33.960
played the first 5 cards.,00:19:33.960,00:19:35.340
"And we want to maximize
our earnings from here on.",00:19:35.340,00:19:37.860

is, how do we",00:19:40.630,00:19:42.120
"maximize our earnings
starting here?",00:19:42.120,00:19:45.030
"So given that the
deck has these cards,",00:19:45.030,00:19:51.160
so the cards from 5 to 51.,00:19:51.160,00:19:53.420
"What's the maximum
amount of money",00:19:53.420,00:19:55.010
"we can make by
playing optimally?",00:19:55.010,00:19:56.590

of money we can",00:20:02.360,00:20:07.710
"win by playing optimally,
starting around at card i.",00:20:07.710,00:20:17.190
Starting at i.,00:20:21.370,00:20:24.515
"So if I want to compute
this-- by the way, speaking",00:20:28.470,00:20:32.680
"of bad variable names,
we did this before.",00:20:32.680,00:20:36.210
"When people don't know
how to name this array",00:20:36.210,00:20:38.410
they name it dpi.,00:20:38.410,00:20:39.550
I think we did that in our PSet.,00:20:39.550,00:20:41.670
"So this is the most useless
name you can have for the array.",00:20:41.670,00:20:45.919
"It just tells you that we're
using dynamic programming.",00:20:45.919,00:20:48.210
"But it doesn't really
tell you what it means.",00:20:48.210,00:20:49.810
"So we're going to go
for it, because it's",00:20:49.810,00:20:51.730
nice and easy to write.,00:20:51.730,00:20:53.540
"So if I want to compute
dp of i, how do I do that?",00:20:53.540,00:21:00.180

exactly the same.",00:21:40.100,00:21:41.670

All right.,00:22:11.550,00:22:12.050
"I hope we can do a
bit better than that.",00:22:20.890,00:22:24.410
"AUDIENCE: So we know that
it's a max of 6, right?",00:22:24.410,00:22:26.941

that in instead?",00:22:26.941,00:22:29.200
That's given the rules.,00:22:29.200,00:22:30.680

"I'm not, so I'm
just writing this.",00:22:33.170,00:22:35.910

infinity, which makes sure",00:22:49.970,00:22:52.860
I never choose that path.,00:22:52.860,00:22:55.390
So all that is hidden in there.,00:22:55.390,00:22:57.650
"You're smart enough in
blackjack so you can write 6.",00:22:57.650,00:22:59.880
I'm not so I can't.,00:22:59.880,00:23:02.370
So 52 minus i.,00:23:02.370,00:23:05.660
OK what I do next?,00:23:05.660,00:23:08.600
Do I copy this next line?,00:23:08.600,00:23:10.770
Or do I change it?,00:23:10.770,00:23:11.900
Yeah let's copy it over.,00:23:16.520,00:23:17.940
Sounds good.,00:23:17.940,00:23:18.440
How about this?,00:23:28.480,00:23:29.540
Do I copy this?,00:23:29.540,00:23:32.780
Trick question.,00:23:32.780,00:23:35.470
Come on guys.,00:23:35.470,00:23:36.210
So do I copy this line or not?,00:23:38.830,00:23:41.320
Do I have a graph here?,00:23:41.320,00:23:43.290
Can I draw edges?,00:23:43.290,00:23:45.130
OK so I'm not going to copy it.,00:23:45.130,00:23:46.630
What do I do instead?,00:23:46.630,00:23:49.150
By trick I mean easy.,00:23:49.150,00:23:51.180
So what do I do instead?,00:23:51.180,00:23:54.607
I compute my answer directly.,00:23:54.607,00:23:55.815
"So if I hit h cards,
what am I looking at?",00:23:58.320,00:24:06.715
"AUDIENCE: Do you
mean like a function?",00:24:06.715,00:24:09.722
"PROFESSOR: A function, sorry?",00:24:09.722,00:24:10.930
"AUDIENCE: You add the
dp of o 1 or of o 0.",00:24:10.930,00:24:14.910
"PROFESSOR: OK so first
let's see if I have i cards,",00:24:20.390,00:24:22.950
"and say I hit, I do the same
exact thing that I did before.",00:24:22.950,00:24:27.010
I look at i is 5 and h equals 2.,00:24:27.010,00:24:31.470
"So then that function gives
me the same answer, 6 1.",00:24:31.470,00:24:36.760
"So then I know that after this
I'm going to end up in a state",00:24:36.760,00:24:39.420
"where I played the
first 11 cards.",00:24:39.420,00:24:43.490
So I'm going to end up at 11.,00:24:43.490,00:24:45.445
"How much money did
I make overall?",00:24:49.140,00:24:51.750
"OK, so 1 in this case.",00:24:56.870,00:24:58.000
"So how much money I made is
o of-- I think it's o of 1.",00:25:00.750,00:25:12.230
"And after I land here, how
much money I'm going to make?",00:25:15.250,00:25:21.050
"Assuming I'm still
playing optimally.",00:25:21.050,00:25:23.314

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:25:35.474,00:25:36.390
OK.,00:25:43.620,00:25:45.360
"So i plus o of 0 is
used to compute--",00:25:45.360,00:25:51.290
"so dp of i plus o of 0 is
used to compute dp of i.",00:25:51.290,00:25:54.410
This is the same thing as--,00:25:54.410,00:25:55.990
AUDIENCE: dp is a function here?,00:25:55.990,00:25:58.027
PROFESSOR: No.,00:25:58.027,00:25:58.610
"So you're wondering
what the hell?",00:26:03.450,00:26:05.420
"Why will that work, right?",00:26:05.420,00:26:06.520
Let's get to that in a minute.,00:26:06.520,00:26:08.320
"That will work, we
have to make it work.",00:26:08.320,00:26:10.030
"So here I'm drawing an edge
from i to i plus o of 0.",00:26:12.730,00:26:17.450
"And the cost of the
edge is minus o of 1.",00:26:17.450,00:26:21.870
So here we're looking at edges.,00:26:21.870,00:26:23.260
"Here I'm assuming
that they already",00:26:23.260,00:26:25.750
"computed the answer here
using some black magic.",00:26:25.750,00:26:28.370
It's already available.,00:26:28.370,00:26:30.390
"And I want to compute
the answer here.",00:26:30.390,00:26:33.290
"So I have the cost of the
edge plus whatever I had here.",00:26:33.290,00:26:38.370
"So if, suppose I know
that if I start here",00:26:41.590,00:26:45.200
"and I finish the
deck, I can make $20.",00:26:45.200,00:26:50.340
"So suppose I know
that this is 20.",00:26:50.340,00:26:52.480
What will the answer be here?,00:26:52.480,00:26:53.730
1 plus 20 which is?,00:26:58.420,00:26:59.690
"So if I hit-- how many times
did I say there-- if I hit twice",00:27:05.550,00:27:10.770
I guess I'll make 21.,00:27:10.770,00:27:12.920
So this is a possible answer.,00:27:12.920,00:27:15.780
"And I have to go over
all possible answers.",00:27:15.780,00:27:18.570
"So this is how much I'm making
if I hit h cards, right?",00:27:18.570,00:27:24.880
"Now I'm looking at
multiple choices here.",00:27:27.670,00:27:30.810
"This is the answer
for each choice.",00:27:30.810,00:27:33.310
"Which answer do I
want in the end?",00:27:33.310,00:27:37.450
The largest.,00:27:37.450,00:27:38.330
OK.,00:27:38.330,00:27:39.340
"So let's say I'm going to
start with a choices array that",00:27:39.340,00:27:44.860
stores all the answers.,00:27:44.860,00:27:46.730
"So here I'm just going
to pend the answer,",00:27:46.730,00:27:48.970
the possible answer.,00:27:48.970,00:27:51.200
Choices append this guy.,00:27:51.200,00:27:56.470
"And then at the
end of the for loop",00:27:56.470,00:27:58.200
"I'm going to take
the max of choices,",00:27:58.200,00:28:04.820
"and I'm going to
assign it where?",00:28:04.820,00:28:06.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:28:10.314,00:28:11.230
"PROFESSOR: So I promised I'm
going to compute dp of i.",00:28:15.500,00:28:17.750
"I just finished
computing dp of i.",00:28:17.750,00:28:19.690
"Now there's a
little problem here.",00:28:23.770,00:28:25.380
"In order to compute
this guy, I need",00:28:25.380,00:28:28.960

answer for this guy.",00:28:28.960,00:28:31.240
"And maybe for some
other guys here.",00:28:31.240,00:28:35.730
"So an answer here depends
on future answers.",00:28:39.550,00:28:41.790
"The arrows here are the same
as the arrows here, right?",00:28:44.920,00:28:47.810
"They represent possible
moves in the game.",00:28:47.810,00:28:51.760

"When we hear the
word dependencies",00:29:01.234,00:29:02.650
what do we think of?,00:29:02.650,00:29:03.483
Topological sort.,00:29:06.920,00:29:09.670
"PSet, which one?",00:29:09.670,00:29:10.730
"PSet 6 still brings
painful memories?",00:29:10.730,00:29:13.180
Not anymore.,00:29:13.180,00:29:13.860
We have a new one.,00:29:13.860,00:29:15.580
"So in order to
compute this I need",00:29:15.580,00:29:17.660
"to compute the answer to
a few other sub-problems.",00:29:17.660,00:29:21.610
"To make sure that I have these
answers ready by the time",00:29:21.610,00:29:24.870
I compute this.,00:29:24.870,00:29:25.640
"So to make sure that
this code doesn't",00:29:25.640,00:29:27.223
"crash I have to compute all
the answers to the sub-problems",00:29:27.223,00:29:31.290

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:29:40.794,00:29:41.710
"PROFESSOR: Yep, thank you guys.",00:29:41.710,00:29:43.150
So start at the easiest problem.,00:29:46.340,00:29:48.340
"What do you do if
you have one card?",00:29:48.340,00:29:50.030
"And then go look at bigger and
bigger and bigger problems,",00:29:50.030,00:29:53.220
"until we tackle
the hard problems",00:29:53.220,00:29:54.680
"of what I do with
the entire deck.",00:29:54.680,00:29:57.360
"So when I compute this problem
I'm going to go to iterate how?",00:29:57.360,00:30:05.020
From where to where?,00:30:05.020,00:30:07.364
AUDIENCE: 52 minus i to the 0.,00:30:07.364,00:30:08.792
You're actually--,00:30:08.792,00:30:10.480
PROFESSOR: So this is i.,00:30:10.480,00:30:11.572
"AUDIENCE: Oh, that's i.",00:30:11.572,00:30:12.530
"PROFESSOR: So where
do i go from here?",00:30:12.530,00:30:14.700
AUDIENCE: 51 to 0.,00:30:14.700,00:30:16.025
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:30:16.025,00:30:16.900
"So now whenever
I access this guy",00:30:20.940,00:30:22.930
I know it's already computed.,00:30:22.930,00:30:24.356
"So the code isn't
going to crash.",00:30:24.356,00:30:25.730
"OK and this thing is
my topological sort.",00:30:30.800,00:30:35.370
"So the advantage of
this is that the code",00:30:41.920,00:30:43.750
"is a lot smaller, right?",00:30:43.750,00:30:45.840
Here I'm building the graph.,00:30:45.840,00:30:47.250
"So I'm calling
some graph methods.",00:30:47.250,00:30:48.760
"And then I would have to
have the code for computing",00:30:48.760,00:30:51.830
the shortest path in a DAG.,00:30:51.830,00:30:54.430
"And then I would have to
have some code for extracting",00:30:54.430,00:30:57.190
the answer using that.,00:30:57.190,00:31:00.490
Here this is all the code.,00:31:00.490,00:31:02.230
It's a few lines.,00:31:02.230,00:31:03.010
"And it's because the graph
is represented implicitly.",00:31:03.010,00:31:05.960
"The topological sort is
represented implicitly.",00:31:05.960,00:31:08.550
"The edges are
represented implicitly.",00:31:08.550,00:31:11.770
So this looks like magic.,00:31:11.770,00:31:13.710
"But if you know where to
look you'll find the items.",00:31:13.710,00:31:16.056
"You'll find the things that tell
you what the graph looks like.",00:31:16.056,00:31:18.680
Yes?,00:31:18.680,00:31:19.958
"AUDIENCE: So that tells
you how much money",00:31:19.958,00:31:21.768
"you can make, but
does it tell you can--",00:31:21.768,00:31:23.745
PROFESSOR: How you make it?,00:31:23.745,00:31:24.870
Not yet.,00:31:24.870,00:31:26.685
Parent pointers.,00:31:26.685,00:31:29.380
Yeah that's a good point.,00:31:29.380,00:31:32.140
"Let me see how
we're doing on time.",00:31:32.140,00:31:33.690
OK.,00:31:33.690,00:31:35.460
I can talk parent pointers.,00:31:35.460,00:31:37.850
Am I missing anything else?,00:31:37.850,00:31:39.150
"There's one decision
that I'm missing,",00:31:44.010,00:31:46.170
that I missed here too.,00:31:46.170,00:31:47.500
"If things look bad
for you, if you",00:31:50.200,00:31:52.710
"know you're going to lose
money, what can you do?",00:31:52.710,00:31:54.980
Walk away.,00:31:58.240,00:31:58.900
How much do you get?,00:31:58.900,00:32:00.620
AUDIENCE: 0.,00:32:00.620,00:32:02.500
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:32:02.500,00:32:03.420
"So you always have an
edge that takes you",00:32:03.420,00:32:07.510
all the way out with cost 0.,00:32:07.510,00:32:11.400
"So the way I represent that here
is I start with a choice of 0.",00:32:11.400,00:32:15.070
OK now let's do parent pointers.,00:32:19.540,00:32:20.970
"What's the easiest way
of doing parent pointers?",00:32:20.970,00:32:23.040
"AUDIENCE: Keep track of
the max of-- [INAUDIBLE].",00:32:28.200,00:32:30.625
"PROFESSOR: So I want to keep
track-- for every answer here",00:32:37.910,00:32:40.560
"I want to keep back of the h
that led me to that answer.",00:32:40.560,00:32:44.257
"So in the dynamic
programming vector,",00:32:46.880,00:32:49.950
"instead of just storing
the maximum cost,",00:32:49.950,00:32:52.010
"I'm going to store the maximum
cost and the number of hits",00:32:52.010,00:32:55.600
I have to make to get there.,00:32:55.600,00:32:57.760
"So instead of having one
number here that's 21",00:32:57.760,00:32:59.911
I'm going to have two numbers.,00:32:59.911,00:33:01.160
"I'm going to have
21 and the 1 that",00:33:01.160,00:33:04.450
"says you have to hit-- sorry,
2-- you have to hit twice.",00:33:04.450,00:33:07.850
"And then you'll go on this
arrow and so on and so forth.",00:33:07.850,00:33:12.060
"And if you know
how many hits you",00:33:12.060,00:33:14.630
"have to make you
can follow this--",00:33:14.630,00:33:17.010
"you can follow these
parent pointers",00:33:17.010,00:33:18.540
"and they will tell you how
to play the entire game.",00:33:18.540,00:33:21.240
"You start at 0 and
play the entire game.",00:33:21.240,00:33:23.760
"Do we want to change the
pseudocode to do that?",00:33:23.760,00:33:28.010
"OK, it's not too hard.",00:33:28.010,00:33:30.540
"How many people want to
see the pseudocode changes?",00:33:30.540,00:33:34.190
"All right, I guess I don't
have to write it then.",00:33:34.190,00:33:37.580
OK any questions on this?,00:33:37.580,00:33:40.700
So the change is really simple.,00:33:40.700,00:33:43.150
"Instead of storing one
number you store a tuple.",00:33:43.150,00:33:45.430
"And then because
tuples are sorted",00:33:45.430,00:33:48.570
"the right way
maximum still works.",00:33:48.570,00:33:50.100
"You don't have to
change that, you just",00:33:50.100,00:33:51.724
"have to change what
you store down there.",00:33:51.724,00:33:56.152
"AUDIENCE: So you just
add h in, into your--",00:33:56.152,00:34:00.080
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, you add one
more parentheses for the tuple.",00:34:00.080,00:34:03.100
"Wait, I already have
two, OK, never mind.",00:34:03.100,00:34:05.665
"AUDIENCE: You have to go through
your choices, so you just--",00:34:05.665,00:34:08.165
"AUDIENCE: Is there any
difference in making",00:34:10.448,00:34:12.239
"a separate dictionary

on how your brain works.,00:34:21.960,00:34:23.830

Yes?,00:34:41.400,00:34:43.850
"AUDIENCE: Could I
generalize and say",00:34:43.850,00:34:46.302
"that if you have
a topological sort",00:34:46.302,00:34:47.760
you can do everything backwards.,00:34:47.760,00:34:49.730

use memoization.",00:34:49.730,00:34:53.417

you're doing it",00:34:53.417,00:34:55.000
"in the order of the
topological sort.",00:34:55.000,00:34:56.719
You're not doing it backwards.,00:34:56.719,00:34:59.450
"AUDIENCE: Oh, OK sorry.",00:34:59.450,00:35:00.720
"If you have a
topological sort then",00:35:00.720,00:35:02.445
you should do it in that order.,00:35:02.445,00:35:03.736
"But if you don't have
a topological sort",00:35:03.736,00:35:06.300
then you should do memoization.,00:35:06.300,00:35:08.147
"PROFESSOR: If you don't
know the topological sort.",00:35:08.147,00:35:10.230
"But there has to be one, right?",00:35:10.230,00:35:11.521
"Because otherwise you
have infinite loops.",00:35:11.521,00:35:13.970
"If you have an infinite loop
in your dependency graph,",00:35:13.970,00:35:16.274
"then you're not going
to have an answer.",00:35:16.274,00:35:17.940
"So that means you're
dp formulation is bad.",00:35:17.940,00:35:21.634
"Fortunately for all
the problems that we",00:35:21.634,00:35:23.300
"have the topological
sort is pretty obvious.",00:35:23.300,00:35:26.450

around.,00:35:30.690,00:35:32.890
"AUDIENCE: So then
memoization is?",00:35:32.890,00:35:35.810
"PROFESSOR: So
memoization is, it's",00:35:35.810,00:35:38.800
"more of a proof
of concept thing.",00:35:38.800,00:35:40.410
"It shows you that if
you have the recursion,",00:35:40.410,00:35:43.360
"everything else can
be done automatically.",00:35:43.360,00:35:45.501
"So like if you build a graph
then you can run top sort",00:35:45.501,00:35:47.750
"and get the answer, you
don't have to think about it.",00:35:47.750,00:35:50.470
"We think about it because
the code is smaller",00:35:50.470,00:35:53.230
if we do it this way.,00:35:53.230,00:35:55.250
"If I'd have to
write memoization I",00:35:55.250,00:35:56.735
"would add 4 or 5
more lines, right?",00:35:56.735,00:35:58.840
"But the point of doing it
that way is, all you need",00:35:58.840,00:36:01.920
is that recursion.,00:36:01.920,00:36:02.730
"If you have this-- so
this is the magic part.",00:36:02.730,00:36:06.830

here of what your choices are",00:36:06.830,00:36:10.460
"and max, how you combine
them, then everything else",00:36:10.460,00:36:13.350
is mechanical.,00:36:13.350,00:36:13.944
"Once you've solved
enough problems",00:36:13.944,00:36:15.360
"everything else is just
follow the process.",00:36:15.360,00:36:17.820
"So this is the equivalent
of in graph problems,",00:36:23.210,00:36:25.410
"the hard part is figuring
out what the state is.",00:36:25.410,00:36:27.410
"Once you know what
the state you know",00:36:27.410,00:36:28.840
"that these are the
vertices, and you",00:36:28.840,00:36:30.040
"know how to draw
edges between them.",00:36:30.040,00:36:31.540
"And then you know
what algorithm to run.",00:36:31.540,00:36:33.560
"So the hard part is still
knowing what the state is.",00:36:33.560,00:36:36.520
Anything else?,00:36:40.400,00:36:41.050
So this is dynamic programming.,00:36:45.480,00:36:47.560
Smaller code.,00:36:47.560,00:36:48.510
This is the graph approach.,00:36:48.510,00:36:50.480
"They essentially
compute the same thing.",00:36:50.480,00:36:52.650
"This is more code,
this is less code.",00:36:52.650,00:36:55.714
"And if you see the
correspondence between them",00:36:55.714,00:36:57.630
"then you understand the
problem a little bit better.",00:36:57.630,00:37:02.996
"The main point is when
you have a new problem",00:37:02.996,00:37:04.870
you can approach it either way.,00:37:04.870,00:37:06.030
"If you see the dynamic
programming solution right away",00:37:06.030,00:37:08.279
"write it down, you're done.",00:37:08.279,00:37:09.610
"If not, draw the graph.",00:37:09.610,00:37:10.980
"Think of what the state
is, draw the edges.",00:37:10.980,00:37:12.840
"And then after that
you can write the math.",00:37:12.840,00:37:14.990
"OK let's talk about
a new problem.",00:37:19.350,00:37:20.890
"Let's talk about the problem
that shows up on interviews.",00:37:23.890,00:37:28.080
People excited about interviews?,00:37:28.080,00:37:29.550
"OK suppose you have a
sequence of numbers,",00:37:43.780,00:37:46.340
"I'm going to draw
a sequence here.",00:37:46.340,00:37:47.760
"And you want to
find the shortest",00:37:55.870,00:37:58.560
increasing sub-sequence.,00:37:58.560,00:38:00.720
"So you get to choose some
numbers out of these numbers.",00:38:00.720,00:38:04.040
"And they have to form
an increasing sequence.",00:38:04.040,00:38:07.950
"So for example
this is a sequence.",00:38:07.950,00:38:13.750
It happens to be increasing.,00:38:13.750,00:38:16.310
"This is also a sequence,
but it's not increasing.",00:38:16.310,00:38:18.790
So it's not a valid answer.,00:38:18.790,00:38:21.170
"And I want the longest sequence,
the longest sub-sequence",00:38:21.170,00:38:25.180
that is increasing.,00:38:25.180,00:38:26.050
Does the problem make sense?,00:38:31.620,00:38:32.920
How do we solve it?,00:38:39.370,00:38:41.110
"Do we want to solve it
using dynamic programming",00:38:41.110,00:38:43.200
or using graphs?,00:38:43.200,00:38:44.060
"OK so votes for
dynamic programming.",00:38:48.600,00:38:52.120
Votes for graph.,00:38:52.120,00:38:54.740
"Well too bad, it looks
prettier as a graph.",00:38:54.740,00:38:56.820
"So how do we solve it as a
dynamic programming problem?",00:38:56.820,00:38:59.660
What are the sub-problems?,00:39:02.407,00:39:03.490
"AUDIENCE: The
largest sub-sequence",00:39:09.370,00:39:13.060
"PROFESSOR: Starting
somewhere, right?",00:39:13.060,00:39:14.812
"I'm going to go off
that answer because I",00:39:20.220,00:39:22.060
know how to go off of it better.,00:39:22.060,00:39:24.990
So say start here.,00:39:24.990,00:39:27.180
Say start at 4.,00:39:27.180,00:39:29.940
Or actually say I start at 3.,00:39:29.940,00:39:32.460
I have two choices.,00:39:36.050,00:39:37.780
"5, which is closer to me.",00:39:37.780,00:39:39.520
And 4.,00:39:39.520,00:39:40.450
"Well I have a few more choices,
but they're further away.",00:39:40.450,00:39:42.951
Whatever.,00:39:42.951,00:39:43.450
"So these are my
choices starting at 3.",00:39:47.720,00:39:51.300
"If I decide that I'm
going to go from 3 to 4",00:39:51.300,00:39:53.930
"and the next number
I choose is 4,",00:39:53.930,00:39:57.410
"now I want the
longest sub-sequence",00:39:57.410,00:39:59.260
"starting at 4, right?",00:39:59.260,00:40:01.180
"It still has to be
longest sub-sequence.",00:40:01.180,00:40:03.060
"So from here on, no matter
what happened before,",00:40:03.060,00:40:05.090
"my behavior still
has to be optimal.",00:40:05.090,00:40:08.550
"If instead I chose 7, I don't
care what happened before.",00:40:08.550,00:40:12.600
"The behavior still
has to be optimal.",00:40:12.600,00:40:15.630
"So a sub-problem says
start at number i.",00:40:15.630,00:40:19.551
So starting at number i.,00:40:22.270,00:40:27.510
"By the way we're going to
use zero-based indexing again",00:40:27.510,00:40:29.880
because we like it.,00:40:29.880,00:40:31.770
"So starting at number
i, what's the longest",00:40:36.840,00:40:39.100
"increasing
sub-sequence I can get?",00:40:39.100,00:40:40.750
"So the length of the
blah, blah, blah.",00:40:45.590,00:40:49.860
"The length of,
you get the point.",00:40:49.860,00:40:51.570
"OK so I'm going to have
an array again, right?",00:40:56.570,00:41:00.439
Which stores the answers.,00:41:00.439,00:41:01.480
"The array is going
to be named dp.",00:41:01.480,00:41:05.570
"If I have N numbers I'm going
to have N elements, from 0",00:41:08.400,00:41:11.580
to N minus 1.,00:41:11.580,00:41:14.010
Suppose I'm at element i.,00:41:14.010,00:41:17.470
"And suppose this original
array is called a.",00:41:17.470,00:41:21.940
"I'm in the mood for good
variable names today.",00:41:21.940,00:41:26.220
So how do I compute dp if i?,00:41:26.220,00:41:27.755
"Let's write some
pseudocode for it.",00:41:36.700,00:41:38.250
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

"AUDIENCE: The number of
steps we want to take--",00:41:51.134,00:41:56.520

3.,00:42:02.348,00:42:03.894

I'm going to have",00:42:03.894,00:42:05.310
"to do additions
and subtractions,",00:42:05.310,00:42:06.740
and this is going to confuse me.,00:42:06.740,00:42:09.300
So how about I propose this.,00:42:09.300,00:42:11.330
"What you say is perfectly
valid, but instead, to make sure",00:42:11.330,00:42:14.030
"I don't make too
many mistakes, I'm",00:42:14.030,00:42:15.867
"going to look at the
number I land at.",00:42:15.867,00:42:17.450
At the index directly.,00:42:17.450,00:42:19.130
"So I'm going to say I
start at i and end at j.",00:42:19.130,00:42:23.000
So the next step is j.,00:42:23.000,00:42:25.590
And then your h is j minus i.,00:42:25.590,00:42:30.580
"So I'm not going to look at the
number of numbers I hop over,",00:42:30.580,00:42:33.440
"all I care about
is where do I land.",00:42:33.440,00:42:36.390
"So what's the next number
in the sub-sequence?",00:42:36.390,00:42:40.170
"If I do it that way,
where do I start?",00:42:40.170,00:42:42.195
AUDIENCE: i plus 1.,00:42:45.928,00:42:47.910
"So I can choose the same
number twice, right?",00:42:47.910,00:42:49.950
So plus 1 to n.,00:42:52.960,00:42:54.920
"And then I'm going to have
a choices array here that I",00:42:54.920,00:42:59.194
"start, initialize with nothing.",00:42:59.194,00:43:03.030
"And then what's the
candidate, if I'm at j?",00:43:03.030,00:43:06.270
So what answer am I looking at?,00:43:11.770,00:43:16.875

considering choosing j",00:43:21.160,00:43:23.690
"as the next element, then my
sequence will be-- my sequence",00:43:23.690,00:43:27.390
length will be dp of j almost.,00:43:27.390,00:43:33.490
Plus 1.,00:43:33.490,00:43:34.970
"OK, can I choose all the--
can I go through all the j's?",00:43:34.970,00:43:40.290
Can I go from 3 to 2.,00:43:40.290,00:43:45.670

Can I go forward?,00:46:28.180,00:46:29.180
Nope.,00:46:29.180,00:46:30.630
So this is going to be 1.,00:46:30.630,00:46:31.740
"Now for 7 my array of
choices has a default of 1.",00:46:34.510,00:46:38.840
"And then for-- let me
write the indices too,",00:46:41.600,00:46:46.360
so I don't get confused.,00:46:46.360,00:46:49.160
"0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.",00:46:49.160,00:46:53.210
And these are i's.,00:46:53.210,00:46:53.960
"So we're at 7, i equals 6.",00:46:56.800,00:46:58.900
"For j equals 7, is a of
j greater than a of i?",00:46:58.900,00:47:04.880
OK.,00:47:04.880,00:47:05.610
"So then 7, 11 is a
possible choice, right?",00:47:05.610,00:47:09.890
"So if I choose 11 as the
next point in my sequence,",00:47:09.890,00:47:14.670
"what's the total
sequence length?",00:47:14.670,00:47:17.390
2.,00:47:17.390,00:47:18.400
And 1 plus dp of 7 equals 2.,00:47:18.400,00:47:22.130
So this is good.,00:47:22.130,00:47:22.880
So far the answers add up.,00:47:22.880,00:47:24.980
"So I have 1 and 2
as my candidates",00:47:24.980,00:47:28.420
for the answer 2dp of 6.,00:47:28.420,00:47:30.210
What's the maximum?,00:47:30.210,00:47:33.880
All right.,00:47:33.880,00:47:35.480
Works so far.,00:47:35.480,00:47:36.800
How about 9?,00:47:36.800,00:47:37.610
"What are the possible
answers for 9?",00:47:42.180,00:47:43.960
So what's choices?,00:47:43.960,00:47:45.160
"First there's 1,
there's always 1.",00:47:45.160,00:47:47.520
"And then for j equals
6, will the if be true?",00:47:47.520,00:47:53.540
No.,00:47:53.540,00:47:54.210
"I can't add a 7
after a 9, right?",00:47:54.210,00:47:56.020
So go to the next one.,00:47:56.020,00:47:57.700
"For j equals 7,
will the if be true?",00:47:57.700,00:48:02.094
"So this append
will happen, right?",00:48:02.094,00:48:03.510
"What will be appended
in the array?",00:48:03.510,00:48:05.430
"And this means that if I'm at
9, and then the next element is",00:48:10.030,00:48:13.940
"11, the longest sequence
I can get has length 2.",00:48:13.940,00:48:17.930
"OK, what's the answer for 9?",00:48:17.930,00:48:19.860
"So if I start at 9 the
longest sequence I can make",00:48:22.740,00:48:25.340
has length 2.,00:48:25.340,00:48:27.260
Let's look at 4 now.,00:48:27.260,00:48:28.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:48:35.240,00:48:37.520
PROFESSOR: What is?,00:48:37.520,00:48:39.930
"AUDIENCE: Just in general
that's-- the problem is defined",00:48:39.930,00:48:42.900
"as, OK in this case
you go from 9 to 11.",00:48:42.900,00:48:46.170
"Or do you have to go from
9 to the next element?",00:48:46.170,00:48:49.944
"PROFESSOR: So this is
the longest sub-sequence",00:48:49.944,00:48:51.860
"if I do-- so the longest
sub-sequence I get overall.",00:48:51.860,00:48:55.340
"I don't have to go
to the next element.",00:48:55.340,00:48:57.960
"So if my problem looks like
this, what is the best answer?",00:48:57.960,00:49:01.810
"AUDIENCE: It's
almost defined as--",00:49:01.810,00:49:03.440
"PROFESSOR: So the
problem is defined",00:49:03.440,00:49:04.940
"as, this is your first
element in the sub-sequence.",00:49:04.940,00:49:08.730
"What's the best
answer you can get?",00:49:08.730,00:49:11.154
"AUDIENCE: I thought in
that case it would be 1",00:49:11.154,00:49:13.070
"because there's nothing
following it that's greater.",00:49:13.070,00:49:15.236
"PROFESSOR: This
is greater, right?",00:49:17.334,00:49:18.750
AUDIENCE: Unless it skips.,00:49:18.750,00:49:19.950
"PROFESSOR: So it's a
sub-sequence, not a sub-string,",00:49:19.950,00:49:22.600
which means it can skip.,00:49:22.600,00:49:24.390
I hope I got these right.,00:49:24.390,00:49:27.260
"So you can skip,
otherwise the answer",00:49:27.260,00:49:29.220
"would be a bit
easier to compute.",00:49:29.220,00:49:33.370
OK how about 4?,00:49:33.370,00:49:34.380
"So let's start with 1
because that's the easy one.",00:49:43.230,00:49:45.850
And then?,00:49:45.850,00:49:48.359
"AUDIENCE: 1, 3, 3, 2, right?",00:49:48.359,00:49:50.724
"Because it's going
to be 3 for that one.",00:49:50.724,00:49:52.390
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:49:52.390,00:49:53.104
"AUDIENCE: And then
3 for this one.",00:49:53.104,00:49:54.520
PROFESSOR: 3 for this one.,00:49:54.520,00:49:55.850
AUDIENCE: And then 2.,00:49:55.850,00:49:57.660
"PROFESSOR: So all these
are bigger, so all of them",00:49:57.660,00:50:00.370
are possible next candidates.,00:50:00.370,00:50:01.740
"And these are the
sequence lengths",00:50:01.740,00:50:03.560
that I can get if I choose them.,00:50:03.560,00:50:05.470
Final answer?,00:50:05.470,00:50:06.755
AUDIENCE: 3.,00:50:06.755,00:50:09.030
PROFESSOR: 3 maximum.,00:50:09.030,00:50:10.646
"AUDIENCE: But for setting
the parent pointers",00:50:10.646,00:50:13.170
"you'd want to take the
closest thing, right?",00:50:13.170,00:50:16.330
"PROFESSOR: As long as it's
a maximum I don't care.",00:50:16.330,00:50:18.577
"So what are possible
parent pointers here?",00:50:21.200,00:50:25.140
"The 2's, right?",00:50:25.140,00:50:26.460
So either this or this.,00:50:26.460,00:50:27.910
Do I care which one I chose?,00:50:27.910,00:50:29.932
"AUDIENCE: No, I guess I don't.",00:50:29.932,00:50:31.652
"PROFESSOR: As long
as I choose a 2.",00:50:31.652,00:50:33.110
"From a 3 I know I
have to go to a 2.",00:50:33.110,00:50:34.650
"I can't go to 1
because otherwise it",00:50:34.650,00:50:36.280
wouldn't be as long as possible.,00:50:36.280,00:50:38.450
"And then from 2's
I have to go to 1,",00:50:38.450,00:50:40.850
and I don't care which one.,00:50:40.850,00:50:43.700
"OK how about 2, what's dp of 2?",00:50:43.700,00:50:46.800
Does everyone else see it?,00:50:50.110,00:50:51.250
"So these are all
possible choices",00:50:54.880,00:50:57.310
"because they're
all bigger than 2.",00:50:57.310,00:50:59.490
"And I get 1 if I don't
choose anything, 4, 3, 3, 2.",00:50:59.490,00:51:04.750
So 4 is the biggest answer.,00:51:04.750,00:51:07.727
"Let's look at this one, this
one's a bit interesting, 5.",00:51:07.727,00:51:10.060
So what are the choices here?,00:51:10.060,00:51:12.360
"1 if I don't look
at anything else.",00:51:12.360,00:51:14.115
Then?,00:51:14.115,00:51:14.615
"There's a 3, 4, then 9.",00:51:20.740,00:51:24.030
"A 3, 4, then 7.",00:51:24.030,00:51:24.860
And?,00:51:24.860,00:51:26.710
And a 2 for the 11.,00:51:26.710,00:51:28.970
"So this if is going to skip
these two elements, which",00:51:28.970,00:51:33.240
"I can't use to make an
increasing sub-sequence.",00:51:33.240,00:51:35.770
"And then it's going
to look at these ones,",00:51:35.770,00:51:37.590
"and it's going to add
1 to the numbers here.",00:51:37.590,00:51:41.290
And I get 3.,00:51:41.290,00:51:41.850
OK.,00:51:44.390,00:51:45.540
What is the answer for 3?,00:51:45.540,00:51:48.031
AUDIENCE: 4.,00:51:48.031,00:51:50.404
"PROFESSOR: And what
is the answer for 8?",00:51:50.404,00:51:52.070
AUDIENCE: 3.,00:51:56.038,00:51:58.520
"PROFESSOR: Right, the
choices are 9 and 11.",00:51:58.520,00:52:01.700
"Starting with itself
and then 9 and 11.",00:52:01.700,00:52:04.940
"So now what's the longest--
what's the answer overall",00:52:04.940,00:52:08.040
for this problem?,00:52:08.040,00:52:08.840
"So it's not dp of 0, right?",00:52:12.040,00:52:14.330
"Before when I had
blackjack I knew",00:52:14.330,00:52:15.980
"that I have to start
at the first card.",00:52:15.980,00:52:18.420
So the answer was dp of 0.,00:52:18.420,00:52:20.780
"In this case it's not
dp 0, it's the maximum",00:52:20.780,00:52:23.720
of all the dp's here.,00:52:23.720,00:52:26.290
"Because I can start my
sequence anywhere I want.",00:52:26.290,00:52:29.111
So I have to take the maximum.,00:52:29.111,00:52:30.360
"And that's the overall answer,
which in this case is 4.",00:52:30.360,00:52:32.800
OK does it make sense now?,00:52:35.880,00:52:38.220
Somewhat?,00:52:38.220,00:52:39.910
"So if you don't
understand please look",00:52:39.910,00:52:41.950
"at how you'd represent
this as a graph.",00:52:41.950,00:52:44.130
"The idea is that the
numbers are nodes",00:52:44.130,00:52:46.260
"and you draw an edge
between numbers,",00:52:46.260,00:52:48.460
"where the first number is
smaller than the second number.",00:52:48.460,00:52:52.110
"Write that formulation, write
the shortest path for that,",00:52:52.110,00:52:55.500
"and see how that
matches to this.",00:52:55.500,00:52:58.310
