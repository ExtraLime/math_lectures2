"We now continue our discussion
of infinite series.",00:00:00.220,00:00:03.410
"Sometimes we have to deal with
series where the terms being",00:00:03.410,00:00:06.350
"added are indexed by multiple
indices, as in",00:00:06.350,00:00:09.710
this example here.,00:00:09.710,00:00:11.220
"We're given numbers, aij,
and i ranges over all",00:00:11.220,00:00:15.710
the positive integers.,00:00:15.710,00:00:17.390
"j also ranges over all the
positive integers.",00:00:17.390,00:00:21.910
"So what does this
sum represent?",00:00:21.910,00:00:25.250
We can think of it as follows.,00:00:25.250,00:00:27.480
"We have here a two-dimensional
grid that corresponds to all",00:00:27.480,00:00:31.330
"the pairs (i,j).",00:00:31.330,00:00:33.750
"And in essence, each one of
those points corresponds to",00:00:33.750,00:00:37.290
"one of the terms that
we want to add.",00:00:37.290,00:00:40.280
"So we can sum the different
terms in some arbitrary order.",00:00:40.280,00:00:43.840
Let's say we start from here.,00:00:43.840,00:00:45.430
"Take that term, add this term,
then add this term here, then",00:00:45.430,00:00:50.950
"add this term, then the next
term, next term, and so on.",00:00:50.950,00:00:55.570
"And we can keep going that
way, adding the different",00:00:55.570,00:00:59.640
"terms according to
some sequence.",00:00:59.640,00:01:02.850
"So essentially, what we're doing
here is we're taking",00:01:02.850,00:01:06.220
"this two-dimensional grid and
arranging the terms associated",00:01:06.220,00:01:11.470
"with that grid, in some
particular linear order.",00:01:11.470,00:01:14.950
"And we're summing those
terms in sequence.",00:01:14.950,00:01:19.090
"As long as this sum converges to
something as we keep adding",00:01:19.090,00:01:25.220
"more and more terms, then
this double series",00:01:25.220,00:01:29.010
will be well defined.,00:01:29.010,00:01:30.800
"Notice, however, we can
add those terms in",00:01:30.800,00:01:33.930
many different orders.,00:01:33.930,00:01:36.100
"And in principle, those
different orders might give us",00:01:36.100,00:01:39.320
different kinds of results.,00:01:39.320,00:01:41.490
"On the other hand, as long as
the sum of the absolute values",00:01:41.490,00:01:47.979
"of all the terms turns out to be
finite, then the particular",00:01:47.979,00:01:54.090
"order in which we're adding the
different terms will turn",00:01:54.090,00:01:58.190
out that it doesn't matter.,00:01:58.190,00:02:02.240
"There's another way that we can
add the terms together,",00:02:02.240,00:02:05.620
and this is the following.,00:02:05.620,00:02:07.500
"Let us consider fixing a
particular choice of i, and",00:02:07.500,00:02:13.860
"adding all of the terms that
are associated with this",00:02:13.860,00:02:18.000
"particular choice of i, as j
ranges from 1 to infinity.",00:02:18.000,00:02:23.300
"So what we're doing is we're
taking the summation from j",00:02:23.300,00:02:28.980
"equal to 1 to infinity, while
keeping the value of i fixed.",00:02:28.980,00:02:37.160
"We do this for every
possible i.",00:02:37.160,00:02:39.450
"So for every possible i,
we're going to get",00:02:39.450,00:02:41.970
a particular number.,00:02:41.970,00:02:43.810
"And then we take the numbers
that we obtain for the",00:02:43.810,00:02:47.360
"different choices if i, so i
ranges from 1 to infinity.",00:02:47.360,00:02:53.170
"And we add all those
terms together.",00:02:53.170,00:02:56.700
"So this is one particular order,
one particular way of",00:02:56.700,00:03:00.230
doing the infinite summation.,00:03:00.230,00:03:02.720
"Now, why start with the
summation over j's while",00:03:02.720,00:03:06.600
keeping i fixed?,00:03:06.600,00:03:08.090
There's no reason for that.,00:03:08.090,00:03:09.790
"We could also carry out the
summation by fixing a",00:03:09.790,00:03:14.410
"particular choice of j and
summing over all i's.",00:03:14.410,00:03:19.880
"So now it is i that ranges
from 1 to infinity.",00:03:19.880,00:03:25.500
"And we look at this
infinite sum.",00:03:25.500,00:03:28.650
"This is the infinite
sum of those terms.",00:03:28.650,00:03:31.170
"We obtain one such infinite
sum for every choice of j.",00:03:31.170,00:03:35.780
"And then we take that sum that
we obtain for any particular",00:03:35.780,00:03:39.720
"choice of j, and add
over the different",00:03:39.720,00:03:43.880
possible values of j.,00:03:43.880,00:03:45.860
So j goes from 1 to infinity.,00:03:45.860,00:03:48.510
"This is a different way of
carrying out the summation.",00:03:48.510,00:03:51.700
"And these are going to give us
the same result, and the same",00:03:51.700,00:03:56.490
"result that we would also obtain
if we were to add the",00:03:56.490,00:03:59.610
"terms in this particular order,
as long as the double",00:03:59.610,00:04:05.060
"series is well-defined, in
the following sense.",00:04:05.060,00:04:09.020
"If we have a guarantee that the
sum of the absolute values",00:04:09.020,00:04:13.030
"of those numbers is finite, no
matter which way we add them,",00:04:13.030,00:04:17.970
"then it turns out that we can
use any particular order to",00:04:17.970,00:04:22.110
add the terms in the series.,00:04:22.110,00:04:23.810
"We're going to get
the same result.",00:04:23.810,00:04:25.750
"And we can also carry out the
double summation by doing--",00:04:25.750,00:04:30.540
"by adding over one
index at a time.",00:04:30.540,00:04:35.440
A word of caution--,00:04:35.440,00:04:37.540
"this condition is not
always satisfied.",00:04:37.540,00:04:40.690
"And in those cases, strange
things can happen.",00:04:40.690,00:04:43.970
"Suppose that the sequences we're
dealing with, the aij's,",00:04:43.970,00:04:49.620
"take those particular values
indicated in this picture.",00:04:49.620,00:04:54.110
"And all the remaining terms, the
aij's associated with the",00:04:54.110,00:04:58.450
"other dots, are all 0's.",00:04:58.450,00:05:01.150
"So all these terms out
there will be 0's.",00:05:01.150,00:05:05.930
"If we carry out the summation by
fixing a j and adding over",00:05:05.930,00:05:12.230
"all i's, what we get here is 0,
and a 0, and a 0, and a 0.",00:05:12.230,00:05:19.270
"That's because in each row we
have a 1 and a minus 1, which",00:05:19.270,00:05:24.020
cancel out and give us 0's.,00:05:24.020,00:05:26.560
"So if we carry out the summation
in this manner, we",00:05:26.560,00:05:32.960
"get a sum of 0's, which is 0.",00:05:32.960,00:05:39.940
"But if we carry out the
summation in this order, fix",00:05:39.940,00:05:43.540
"an i, and then add over all j's,
the first term that we",00:05:43.540,00:05:48.380
"get here is going to be 1,
because in this column, this",00:05:48.380,00:05:53.270
is the only non-zero number.,00:05:53.270,00:05:54.980
"And then in the remaining
columns, as we add the terms,",00:05:54.980,00:05:58.510
"we're going to get 0's,
and 0's, and so on.",00:05:58.510,00:06:03.060
"And so if we carry out the
summation in this way, we",00:06:03.060,00:06:06.970
obtain a 1.,00:06:06.970,00:06:08.500
"So this is an example that shows
you that the order of",00:06:08.500,00:06:12.010
summation actually may matter.,00:06:12.010,00:06:15.670
"In this example, the sum of the
absolute values of all of",00:06:15.670,00:06:19.160
"the terms that are involved is
infinity, because we have",00:06:19.160,00:06:22.780
"infinitely many plus or minus
1's, so this condition here is",00:06:22.780,00:06:27.780
not satisfied in this example.,00:06:27.780,00:06:31.210
"Let us now consider the case
where we want to add the terms",00:06:34.380,00:06:38.110
"of a double sequence, but over
a limited range of indices as",00:06:38.110,00:06:42.800
"in this example, where we have
coefficients aij, which we",00:06:42.800,00:06:46.490
"want to add, but only for those
i's and j's for which j",00:06:46.490,00:06:50.690
is less than or equal to i.,00:06:50.690,00:06:53.580
"Graphically, this means that we
only want to consider the",00:06:53.580,00:06:57.420
pairs shown in this picture.,00:06:57.420,00:06:59.909
"So these points here correspond
to i,j pairs for",00:06:59.909,00:07:04.470
which i is equal to j.,00:07:04.470,00:07:06.690
"Terms on the right, or points
to the right, correspond to",00:07:06.690,00:07:11.200
"i,j pairs for which i is
at least as large as j.",00:07:11.200,00:07:16.400
"We can carry out this summation
in two ways.",00:07:16.400,00:07:19.550
One way is the following.,00:07:19.550,00:07:21.740
"We fix a value of i, and
we consider all of the",00:07:21.740,00:07:25.720
"corresponding terms, that
correspond to different",00:07:25.720,00:07:29.550
choices of j.,00:07:29.550,00:07:31.640
"But we only go up to the point
where i is equal to j.",00:07:31.640,00:07:37.320
This is the largest term.,00:07:37.320,00:07:39.230
So what are we doing here?,00:07:39.230,00:07:41.159
"We're taking the coefficients
aij, and we are adding over",00:07:41.159,00:07:46.960
"all j's, starting from 1, which",00:07:46.960,00:07:51.360
corresponds to this term.,00:07:51.360,00:07:52.840
"And j goes up to the point where
it becomes equal to i.",00:07:52.840,00:07:58.560
"We do this for every
value of i.",00:07:58.560,00:08:01.330
"And so we get a number for the
sum of each one of the",00:08:01.330,00:08:05.470
"columns, and then we add
those numbers together.",00:08:05.470,00:08:10.650
"So we're adding over all
i's, and i ranges",00:08:10.650,00:08:14.350
from 1 up to infinity.,00:08:14.350,00:08:16.300
"This is one way of carrying
out the summation.",00:08:16.300,00:08:19.670
"Alternatively, we could fix a
value of j, and consider doing",00:08:19.670,00:08:24.770
"the summation over
all choices of i.",00:08:24.770,00:08:28.090
"So this corresponds to
the sum over all",00:08:28.090,00:08:32.039
"choices of i, from where?",00:08:32.039,00:08:35.169
"The smallest term, the first
term, happens when i is equal",00:08:35.169,00:08:39.690
to the value of j.,00:08:39.690,00:08:42.780
"And then we have larger choices
of i, numbers for",00:08:42.780,00:08:47.610
"which i is bigger than the
corresponding value of j.",00:08:47.610,00:08:50.880
"And so i ranges from j all
the way to infinity.",00:08:50.880,00:08:56.460
"And this is the sum over one of
the rows in this diagram.",00:08:56.460,00:09:01.260
We do this for every j.,00:09:01.260,00:09:03.140
"We get a result, and then
we need to add all",00:09:03.140,00:09:06.130
those results together.,00:09:06.130,00:09:07.840
"So we're summing for all j's
from 1 up to infinity.",00:09:07.840,00:09:15.170
"So these are two different ways
that we can evaluate this",00:09:15.170,00:09:20.050
"series associated with
a double sequence.",00:09:20.050,00:09:23.550
"We can either add over all j's
first and then over i's, or we",00:09:23.550,00:09:28.060
"can sum over all i's first,
and then over all j's.",00:09:28.060,00:09:33.960
"The two ways of approaching this
problem, this summation,",00:09:33.960,00:09:39.010
"should give us the
same answer.",00:09:39.010,00:09:41.210
"And this is going to be, again,
subject to the usual",00:09:41.210,00:09:45.210
qualification.,00:09:45.210,00:09:46.440
"As long as the sum of the
absolute values of the terms",00:09:46.440,00:09:50.830
"that we're trying to add
is less than infinity--",00:09:50.830,00:09:54.320
"if this condition is true, then
the two ways of carrying",00:09:54.320,00:09:58.800
"out the summation are equal, and
they're just two different",00:09:58.800,00:10:02.650
alternatives.,00:10:02.650,00:10:03.900
