"PROFESSOR: Last time, we looked
at the case of a Bose gas,",00:00:20.980,00:00:28.555
"and we found that there
was this condensation",00:00:28.555,00:00:31.240
phenomena into the ground state.,00:00:31.240,00:00:32.895
Let's go over it one more time.,00:00:36.710,00:00:39.850
"So the idea was
that when you have",00:00:39.850,00:00:43.420
"a Bose system, the occupation
of the different one-particle",00:00:43.420,00:00:48.350
"states, which you can specify
for a non-interacting system",00:00:48.350,00:00:54.210
"in the grand canonical
ensemble, these entities",00:00:54.210,00:00:58.990
"are independent for each one
of the one-particle states",00:00:58.990,00:01:03.240
"and have a form that is related
to the chemical potential",00:01:03.240,00:01:07.340
"and the energy of these states
through this form, epsilon",00:01:07.340,00:01:16.890
"[? kd ?] in the
one-particle state,",00:01:16.890,00:01:19.880
"and z standing for e to the
beta mu, chemical potential",00:01:19.880,00:01:25.100
divided by temperature.,00:01:25.100,00:01:27.950
OK?,00:01:27.950,00:01:30.110
"Now, if we go and look
at this in the limit",00:01:30.110,00:01:35.140
"where z is much
less than 1, which",00:01:35.140,00:01:39.110
"is appropriate to
high temperatures",00:01:39.110,00:01:41.530
"or when the case where the
gas is mostly classical,",00:01:41.530,00:01:45.390
you can expand this.,00:01:45.390,00:01:46.680
"You can see that in
the lowest order,",00:01:46.680,00:01:49.160
"it is z e to the minus
beta epsilon of k.",00:01:49.160,00:01:53.270
"So it looks like a
standard Boltzmann weight",00:01:53.270,00:01:57.840
"that we would use in classical
statistical mechanics.",00:01:57.840,00:02:01.540
"But then there are
higher order terms.",00:02:01.540,00:02:03.440
"And in particular there
would be a correction",00:02:03.440,00:02:05.415
"that is e to the minus
beta epsilon of k squared",00:02:05.415,00:02:10.130
"and so forth that would
modify this result.",00:02:10.130,00:02:15.270
"But I think this is
something that I mentioned.",00:02:15.270,00:02:17.910
"If you look at a form such
as this at high temperatures,",00:02:17.910,00:02:22.790
it's like a Boltzmann weight.,00:02:22.790,00:02:24.970
"So the state that has
this lowest energy,",00:02:24.970,00:02:29.470
"in this case if we
say epsilon of k",00:02:29.470,00:02:32.040
"is h bar squared k squared
over 2m corresponding to k",00:02:32.040,00:02:37.640
"equals to 0 for
the lowest energy,",00:02:37.640,00:02:40.360
"has the highest mean
occupation number of weight.",00:02:40.360,00:02:46.244
OK?,00:02:46.244,00:02:47.690
Now that is always the case.,00:02:47.690,00:02:50.060
"This is a function
that, as epsilon of k",00:02:50.060,00:02:54.310
"becomes larger, no matter
whether you expand it or not,",00:02:54.310,00:02:57.610
becomes less and less.,00:02:57.610,00:03:00.790
"The other limit that
is of interest to us",00:03:00.790,00:03:04.310
is how big can z be?,00:03:04.310,00:03:06.370
"We said that the largest it
can be is when it approaches 1.",00:03:06.370,00:03:12.890
"And when it is 1, this
quantity, the occupation number,",00:03:12.890,00:03:17.340
"is e to the beta
epsilon of k minus 1.",00:03:17.340,00:03:22.750
"Again, something that is
largest as k becomes smaller,",00:03:22.750,00:03:27.650
and you go to the lowest energy.,00:03:27.650,00:03:31.050
"But there is the difficulty that
the one energy that corresponds",00:03:31.050,00:03:34.560
"to k equals to 0, if I
look at this formula,",00:03:34.560,00:03:38.450
it is 1 divided by 0.,00:03:38.450,00:03:41.300
"It just doesn't
make too much sense.",00:03:41.300,00:03:45.970
"Now, of course, we
said that typically we",00:03:45.970,00:03:49.130
"don't want to work
in this variable.",00:03:49.130,00:03:54.490
"We want to figure out
things as a function",00:03:54.490,00:03:56.730
"of the number of particles or
the number of particles divided",00:03:56.730,00:04:00.580
"by volume density, which is
a nice intensive quantity.",00:04:00.580,00:04:06.220
OK?,00:04:06.220,00:04:06.720
"So typically, what should we do?",00:04:06.720,00:04:09.010
"We said that in the
grand canonical ensemble,",00:04:09.010,00:04:11.650
"N is the sum over k
these expectation values.",00:04:11.650,00:04:19.930
"I should really put
an average here,",00:04:19.930,00:04:22.060
"but we said that in the
thermodynamic sense,",00:04:22.060,00:04:24.820
"fluctuations being of the
order of square root of N,",00:04:24.820,00:04:27.580
we are going to ignore.,00:04:27.580,00:04:29.074
"So this is what
you would normally",00:04:29.074,00:04:30.490
"call the number that
we have in the system.",00:04:30.490,00:04:34.530
"And then you have to replace
this sum in the limit",00:04:34.530,00:04:41.240
"where we have a large
system with an integral.",00:04:41.240,00:04:44.420
"So we have the integral
d cubed k 2 pi cubed V.",00:04:44.420,00:04:51.540
"And then we have this N of k,
which is 1 over z inverse e",00:04:51.540,00:05:00.230
"to the beta epsilon
of k minus 1.",00:05:00.230,00:05:03.710
"Now if I go like I did in
the line above to the limit",00:05:07.790,00:05:13.040
"where z is much less
than 1, then the integral",00:05:13.040,00:05:17.650
"that I have to do is
simply the integral of z e",00:05:17.650,00:05:25.670
"to the minus beta epsilon k
h bar squared k squared 2m.",00:05:25.670,00:05:29.840
We know what this is.,00:05:33.220,00:05:34.290
"This is simply, up
to a factor of z,",00:05:34.290,00:05:37.520
"these are the integrals
that have given me",00:05:37.520,00:05:40.680
"these factors of 1
over lambda cubed.",00:05:40.680,00:05:42.745
"Actually, there's
the factor of V",00:05:47.130,00:05:48.890
"here, so it is V
over lambda cubed.",00:05:48.890,00:05:51.004
"So normally, you would
then solve for z,",00:05:53.730,00:05:57.790
"and you would find that z is
the density times lambda cubed.",00:05:57.790,00:06:04.760
"And this is a formula that we
have seen a number of times,",00:06:04.760,00:06:08.450
"that the chemical potential
is kt log of n lambda cubed.",00:06:08.450,00:06:14.356
OK?,00:06:14.356,00:06:16.690
Fine.,00:06:16.690,00:06:17.190
"But now we are interested
in the other limit.",00:06:17.190,00:06:19.140
"Now in the other limit,
we have this difficulty",00:06:22.210,00:06:26.791
"that this quantity, if I look
at it as a function of z,",00:06:26.791,00:06:32.430
"this is the quantity
that we would",00:06:32.430,00:06:34.140
"call f-- it is
related to f 3/2 of z.",00:06:34.140,00:06:40.420
"So this is going to be 1 over
lambda cubed f 3/2 plus of z.",00:06:40.420,00:06:48.080
"It's a function that increases
with z up to the limiting value",00:06:48.080,00:07:00.560
"that we are allowed to have,
which is at z equals to 1.",00:07:00.560,00:07:04.240
"It's a function that starts
linearly, as we have discussed,",00:07:04.240,00:07:08.380
"but then up here, it comes to
a finite value of zeta 3/2.",00:07:08.380,00:07:14.360
OK?,00:07:17.490,00:07:17.990
"So basically, we know that when
I evaluate this for finite z,",00:07:20.540,00:07:26.030
I'm less than where I was here.,00:07:26.030,00:07:28.730
"So this is certainly less
than 1 over lambda cubed zeta",00:07:28.730,00:07:33.650
"of 3/2, the limiting value
that we have over here.",00:07:33.650,00:07:36.970
So now I have a difficulty.,00:07:39.880,00:07:42.730
"This function over here,
I can only make it so big.",00:07:42.730,00:07:50.710
"But I need to make
it big enough so",00:07:50.710,00:07:53.670
"that I can put enough particles,
the total number of particles",00:07:53.670,00:07:57.740
that I have in the system.,00:07:57.740,00:08:00.200
So what is happening over here?,00:08:00.200,00:08:02.720
"What is happening is that when
I make this density larger",00:08:02.720,00:08:09.490
"and larger, ultimately
when I hit this point at z",00:08:09.490,00:08:13.730
"equals to 1, as
we have discussed",00:08:13.730,00:08:17.470
"there is an uncertainty as to
what happens to this expression",00:08:17.470,00:08:23.160
"when z is equal to 1,
and you are at this state",00:08:23.160,00:08:26.600
"that corresponds
to k equals to 0.",00:08:26.600,00:08:30.020
Right?,00:08:30.020,00:08:30.520
"I don't know how many
things are over there.",00:08:30.520,00:08:33.559
"So I can have, in
principle, the freedom",00:08:33.559,00:08:36.400
"to take advantage of the fact
that I don't know what 1 over 0",00:08:36.400,00:08:41.380
"is to call that the number
that I need to make up",00:08:41.380,00:08:47.950
"the difference between
here and there.",00:08:47.950,00:08:51.342
OK?,00:08:51.342,00:08:53.440
"And so, in principle,
when z goes to 1,",00:08:53.440,00:09:02.460
"then this becomes 1 over lambda
cubed, or V over lambda cubed,",00:09:02.460,00:09:09.670
"zeta of 3/2, obtained
by essentially",00:09:09.670,00:09:14.130
"doing the integration
with z equals to 1,",00:09:14.130,00:09:17.290
"evaluating it at
this possible limit.",00:09:17.290,00:09:21.280
"And then whatever
is left, I will",00:09:21.280,00:09:25.580
put in the k equals to 0 state.,00:09:25.580,00:09:29.560
OK?,00:09:29.560,00:09:30.610
"And you will say, well, what
does that explicitly mean?",00:09:30.610,00:09:35.070
"Well, what it means is that
I'm really evaluating things",00:09:38.790,00:09:44.910
"at the value of z that
is extremely close to 1",00:09:44.910,00:09:50.620
"so that in the thermodynamic
limit where N goes to infinity",00:09:50.620,00:09:54.290
I wouldn't know the difference.,00:09:54.290,00:09:57.240
"But it is really something
that vanishes only",00:09:57.240,00:10:01.240
"in that thermodynamic limit
of N going to infinity.",00:10:01.240,00:10:05.120
"And we saw that if I kind
of look at the occupation",00:10:05.120,00:10:09.510
"number of the k equals
to 0 state, what it is",00:10:09.510,00:10:15.050
"is z inverse, which is e to
the minus beta mu minus 1.",00:10:15.050,00:10:27.220
"And if I'm in the limit
where z is very small,",00:10:27.220,00:10:31.250
"or beta mu is-- sorry, z
is very much close to 1",00:10:31.250,00:10:36.650
"or beta mu is very small,
then I can expand this.",00:10:36.650,00:10:41.430
"And this becomes approximately,
when mu goes to 0,",00:10:41.430,00:10:47.930
minus 1 over beta mu.,00:10:47.930,00:10:49.718
OK?,00:10:52.530,00:10:55.230
"And I want this
to be the N0, what",00:10:55.230,00:11:00.130
"is left over when I subtract
from the total number",00:11:00.130,00:11:05.040
"the amount that I can put
in to the ground state.",00:11:05.040,00:11:11.520
OK?,00:11:11.520,00:11:13.010
"And so you can see that this is
a quantity that is extensive.",00:11:13.010,00:11:17.820
"It is proportional to
the number of particles.",00:11:17.820,00:11:21.130
"And mu is the inverse of
that, so it is infinitesimal.",00:11:21.130,00:11:26.670
"And if I choose that value
of mu that is, essentially,",00:11:26.670,00:11:31.480
"pushing z infinitesimally
close to 1,",00:11:31.480,00:11:35.540
"then I can ensure that I have
a finite occupation over there.",00:11:35.540,00:11:41.088
OK?,00:11:41.088,00:11:43.020
So what does it mean?,00:11:43.020,00:11:44.150
"If I could actually look at
these occupation numbers,",00:11:44.150,00:11:50.220
"then I am at temperatures
less than Tc of n.",00:11:50.220,00:11:58.070
"And we saw that
basically we could",00:11:58.070,00:12:00.010
"get what the temperature
is when this happens",00:12:00.010,00:12:03.300
"by equating this combination
g over lambda cubed,",00:12:03.300,00:12:11.180
"in principle, over-- I
had said g equals to 1.",00:12:11.180,00:12:15.090
"I could repeat it
with g not equal to 1.",00:12:15.090,00:12:18.220
"And n, which is g over
lambda cubed zeta of 3/2,",00:12:18.220,00:12:26.210
"rather than f 3/2 plus,
this defines for me",00:12:26.210,00:12:29.640
this temperature Tc of n.,00:12:29.640,00:12:33.345
OK?,00:12:33.345,00:12:36.180
"Now, if I could look at
the occupation numbers",00:12:36.180,00:12:42.060
"when I was at temperature less
than Tc, what would I see?",00:12:42.060,00:12:46.070
"I would see that the occupation
number as a function of k",00:12:46.070,00:12:52.520
"is exactly the form that we
have over here with z equals",00:12:52.520,00:12:56.230
"to 1, 1 over e to the
beta epsilon of k minus 1.",00:12:56.230,00:13:07.830
"But then at k
equals to 0, which I",00:13:07.830,00:13:11.870
"can indicate by some
kind of delta function,",00:13:11.870,00:13:16.370
"I have everybody else,
which is this N minus",00:13:16.370,00:13:20.360
V over lambda cubed zeta of 3/2.,00:13:20.360,00:13:22.910
OK?,00:13:25.670,00:13:28.090
"Actually, let's remember
that our k and momentum",00:13:28.090,00:13:34.200
are related to each other.,00:13:34.200,00:13:36.650
"So rather than asking
what the density is",00:13:36.650,00:13:42.620
"as a function of this
label k, I can maybe",00:13:42.620,00:13:46.360
"ask what the density
is for things",00:13:46.360,00:13:49.350
that have different momentum P.,00:13:49.350,00:13:52.390
"And according to
this formula, it",00:13:52.390,00:13:54.250
"is going to be beta P squared
over 2m, this kind of modified",00:13:54.250,00:14:00.000
"version of the Boltzmann weight,
and a delta function at P",00:14:00.000,00:14:05.140
equals to 0 there.,00:14:05.140,00:14:08.220
"The rest of the
particles are up here.",00:14:08.220,00:14:12.340
"Now, when people
saw the signature",00:14:12.340,00:14:17.070
"of Bose-Einstein condensation,
it was precisely this.",00:14:17.070,00:14:22.080
"So this is the figure
that shows this",00:14:22.080,00:14:29.910
"from the experiment of
Eric Cornell and group,",00:14:29.910,00:14:34.420
and you see two thermometers.,00:14:34.420,00:14:39.920
"They are cooling the
temperature of this gas",00:14:39.920,00:14:43.420
"of atoms that is
confined in a trap.",00:14:43.420,00:14:46.740
"The way that they
are cooling it is",00:14:46.740,00:14:48.390
"that they are evaporating away
the high energy particles.",00:14:48.390,00:14:52.570
"And then the rest
of the particles",00:14:52.570,00:14:55.460
"are cooled down because they
thermalize, and the highest",00:14:55.460,00:14:58.780
energy is always removed.,00:14:58.780,00:15:00.970
"But in the process,
the density in the trap",00:15:00.970,00:15:03.285
is also being reduced.,00:15:03.285,00:15:05.760
"And if the density goes down,
then Tc of n will also go down.",00:15:05.760,00:15:12.660
"So what is plotted over here
on the right thermometer",00:15:12.660,00:15:16.780
"is the Tc of n that you would
calculate from that formula.",00:15:16.780,00:15:21.450
"And on the right
thermometer is actually",00:15:21.450,00:15:24.160
"the temperature of the
particles in the gas.",00:15:24.160,00:15:27.000
"And you can see that
right at some point, then",00:15:27.000,00:15:30.660
"the Tc of the particles in
the gas goes below Tc of n.",00:15:30.660,00:15:35.390
"And what is being plotted
over here is as follows.",00:15:35.390,00:15:38.220
"So you have the
particles that are",00:15:38.220,00:15:39.740
in the trap at some temperature.,00:15:39.740,00:15:44.180
"We remove the trap, and then the
particles are going to escape.",00:15:44.180,00:15:49.250
"The particles that
have zero momentum",00:15:49.250,00:15:51.330
"are going to stay
where they are.",00:15:51.330,00:15:53.410
"The particles that
have large momentum",00:15:53.410,00:15:55.480
are going to go further away.,00:15:55.480,00:15:57.370
"So let's say after one
second you take a picture.",00:15:57.370,00:16:00.570
"And what you see over
here from the picture",00:16:00.570,00:16:03.910
"is over here there
are the particles that",00:16:03.910,00:16:06.930
"had most momentum
and ran further away.",00:16:06.930,00:16:09.655
"While at the center,
you see the particles",00:16:09.655,00:16:12.000
that had small momentum.,00:16:12.000,00:16:14.640
"You can see that always,
even at high temperature,",00:16:14.640,00:16:17.270
the zero momentum is the peak.,00:16:17.270,00:16:19.910
"But once you go below
this condition of Tc of n,",00:16:19.910,00:16:24.190
"in addition to the normal
peak that is over here,",00:16:24.190,00:16:28.650
"you get some additional
peak that is appearing at P",00:16:28.650,00:16:32.210
"equals to 0, which is
the condensation that you",00:16:32.210,00:16:35.130
have into that one single state.,00:16:35.130,00:16:39.005
OK?,00:16:39.005,00:16:39.505
"The other thing that I started
to do last time but let's",00:16:45.460,00:16:50.560
"complete and finish
today is I wanted",00:16:50.560,00:16:54.090
"to show you the heat
capacity of this system.",00:16:54.090,00:17:00.080
OK.,00:17:00.080,00:17:00.580
So how do we do that?,00:17:00.580,00:17:01.690
"So the first
formula that we had,",00:17:01.690,00:17:05.240
"the one that I used over here
if I were to divide by V,",00:17:05.240,00:17:09.869
"is that the density, in general,
is given by g over lambda",00:17:09.869,00:17:15.050
cubed f 3/2 plus of z.,00:17:15.050,00:17:18.970
OK?,00:17:22.710,00:17:24.609
"And we said that if
z goes to 1, then I",00:17:24.609,00:17:29.480
"have to interpret that
appropriately that this",00:17:29.480,00:17:32.770
"is really just excited
states, and there's",00:17:32.770,00:17:37.570
"going to be a separation
into the ground",00:17:37.570,00:17:41.020
state and the excited states.,00:17:41.020,00:17:43.340
"So there is really two portions
of n when we are below Tc.",00:17:43.340,00:17:48.660
OK?,00:17:48.660,00:17:49.210
"But then there is also
a formula for pressure.",00:17:49.210,00:17:52.010
"Beta P was g over
lambda cubed f 5/2 of z.",00:17:52.010,00:18:00.480
"Again, these f's we had
defined-- f plus m minus 1 of z",00:18:00.480,00:18:06.680
"was 1 over m minus 1
factorial integral 0",00:18:06.680,00:18:11.120
"to infinity dx x to the m
minus 1 z inverse e to the x",00:18:11.120,00:18:17.470
plus 1-- minus 1.,00:18:17.470,00:18:20.000
OK?,00:18:24.240,00:18:24.740
Fine.,00:18:27.560,00:18:29.730
"But in order to calculate
the heat capacity,",00:18:29.730,00:18:33.920
I need to work with the energy.,00:18:33.920,00:18:36.520
"And we said that,
quite generally,",00:18:36.520,00:18:38.560
"whether you have
classical system,",00:18:38.560,00:18:41.610
"quantum gas, bosons, fermions,
the energy and pressure",00:18:41.610,00:18:47.000
"are related simply by this
formula, which is ultimately",00:18:47.000,00:18:52.680
"a consequence of the scaling of
the energy being proportional",00:18:52.680,00:18:58.470
"to momentum squared
that we have over there.",00:18:58.470,00:19:03.230
OK?,00:19:03.230,00:19:05.280
So let's look at this formula.,00:19:05.280,00:19:10.900
What do I have?,00:19:10.900,00:19:11.620
"For T that is less than Tc
of n, my z is equal to 1.",00:19:11.620,00:19:19.020
"Pressure comes
entirely from particles",00:19:19.020,00:19:22.820
that are moving around.,00:19:22.820,00:19:24.900
"So although the density
breaks into two components,",00:19:24.900,00:19:29.040
"in principle I guess I would
say that the pressure also",00:19:29.040,00:19:31.970
breaks into two components.,00:19:31.970,00:19:34.190
"But the component that
is at k equals to 0",00:19:34.190,00:19:38.230
is not moving around.,00:19:38.230,00:19:39.410
"It is not giving you any
contribution to the pressure.",00:19:39.410,00:19:43.180
So what do we?,00:19:43.180,00:19:44.035
"We have P is kt, taking
the beta to the other side.",00:19:44.035,00:19:50.460
"I have g over lambda cubed, and
then this f plus evaluated at z",00:19:50.460,00:19:56.860
"equals to 1, which is
this zeta function of 5/2.",00:19:56.860,00:20:02.860
OK?,00:20:02.860,00:20:03.470
So fine.,00:20:03.470,00:20:05.210
So what do I have for energy?,00:20:05.210,00:20:08.490
"Energy is going to be at
3/2 V times this formula,",00:20:08.490,00:20:15.260
"kd T g over lambda
cubed zeta 5/2.",00:20:15.260,00:20:21.870
"And I noticed that lambda, being
h square root of 2 pi mk T,",00:20:21.870,00:20:30.590
scales like T to the minus 1/2.,00:20:30.590,00:20:33.950
"So 1 over lambda cubed
scales like T to the 3/2 plus",00:20:33.950,00:20:37.870
"this is something that's
scaling like T to the 5/2.",00:20:37.870,00:20:40.890
"And this is simply proportional
to the volume and temperature",00:20:45.120,00:20:49.030
to the [INAUDIBLE] fifth power.,00:20:49.030,00:20:50.780
"It knows nothing
about the density.",00:20:50.780,00:20:54.460
Why?,00:20:54.460,00:20:55.010
"Because if you were at the
same temperature and volume,",00:20:55.010,00:20:59.650
"put more particle
in the system, all",00:20:59.650,00:21:02.020
"of those additional
particles would go over here,",00:21:02.020,00:21:04.630
"would make no contribution
to pressure or to energy.",00:21:04.630,00:21:10.370
You wouldn't see them.,00:21:10.370,00:21:12.420
"So once you have this, the heat
capacity at constant volume,",00:21:12.420,00:21:16.450
"dE by dT, is simply 5 over
2T of whatever energy is.",00:21:16.450,00:21:24.860
"And there is a reason that
I write it in this fashion.",00:21:35.960,00:21:41.300
"So what you would
say is that if I",00:21:41.300,00:21:43.810
"were to plot the heat
capacity at constant volume",00:21:43.810,00:21:50.030
"as a function of
temperature, well,",00:21:50.030,00:21:56.040
"it's natural units are
of the order of kB.",00:21:56.040,00:22:01.646
"You can see that this T and
this T I can cancel out.",00:22:01.646,00:22:05.800
"So I have something
that has units of kB.",00:22:05.800,00:22:08.280
"It is extensive
proportional to volume.",00:22:08.280,00:22:11.940
"I can really certainly
write it in this fashion.",00:22:11.940,00:22:17.600
"And what I have
is that the curve",00:22:17.600,00:22:24.090
behaves like T to the 3/2.,00:22:24.090,00:22:27.881
"So this is proportional
to T to the 3/2.",00:22:27.881,00:22:31.130
"And presumably, this behavior
continues all the way",00:22:34.020,00:22:41.530
"until the temperature at
which this system ceases",00:22:41.530,00:22:48.820
"to be a Bose-Einstein
condensate.",00:22:48.820,00:22:51.610
"So the low temperature form of
the heat capacity's calculation",00:22:51.610,00:22:55.530
is very simple.,00:22:55.530,00:22:58.840
"Now, at very high
temperatures, we",00:22:58.840,00:23:01.530
"know that the heat capacity is
going to be 3/2 N kT, right?",00:23:01.530,00:23:09.090
"So ultimately, I know that if
I go to very high temperatures,",00:23:09.090,00:23:16.190
"my heat capacity is
going to be 3/2 N,",00:23:16.190,00:23:23.300
if I divide it by [? kB. ?] OK?,00:23:23.300,00:23:28.530
"Now, there is a reason
that I drew this line",00:23:28.530,00:23:32.080
"over here less
than the peak here.",00:23:32.080,00:23:35.160
"Well, in order to calculate
the heat capacity on this side,",00:23:38.840,00:23:44.030
"we'll have to do a
little bit more work.",00:23:44.030,00:23:46.860
"You can no longer assume
that z equals to 1.",00:23:46.860,00:23:54.980
"z is something
that is less than 1",00:23:54.980,00:23:58.580
"that is obtained by
solving N equals to g over",00:23:58.580,00:24:02.790
lambda cubed f 3/2 plus of z.,00:24:02.790,00:24:07.050
OK?,00:24:07.050,00:24:08.770
"But I can still presumably
use these formulae.",00:24:08.770,00:24:12.200
"I have that the
energy is 3/2 PV.",00:24:12.200,00:24:17.670
"So I have V kT times--
what is the thing",00:24:17.670,00:24:25.760
"that I have on the
right-hand side?",00:24:25.760,00:24:27.400
"It is g over lambda cubed,
just as I have over here",00:24:27.400,00:24:31.940
"except that I have to
put f 5/2 plus of z.",00:24:31.940,00:24:38.130
OK?,00:24:38.130,00:24:41.100
"And if I want to calculate
the heat capacity, what",00:24:41.100,00:24:44.800
"I need to do is to
take a derivative",00:24:44.800,00:24:46.700
"of the energy with
respect to temperature.",00:24:46.700,00:24:51.020
"And then I notice, well,
again, right like I had before,",00:24:51.020,00:24:55.790
"whatever appears here is
proportional to T to the 5/2.",00:24:55.790,00:24:58.996
"So when I take a derivative
with respect to temperature,",00:25:02.090,00:25:04.950
"I essentially get 5/2 this
whole quantity divided by T.",00:25:04.950,00:25:10.850
"So just like I had over
here, I will write the result",00:25:10.850,00:25:14.300
as 3/2 V kT g over lambda cubed.,00:25:14.300,00:25:22.220
"And then I have the 5/2 1
over T of f 5/2 plus of z.",00:25:22.220,00:25:31.290
"But you say that's the
wrong way of doing things",00:25:35.320,00:25:39.380
"because in addition to this
combination out front be",00:25:39.380,00:25:45.680
"explicitly proportional
to T to the 5/2 power,",00:25:45.680,00:25:50.300
"this factor z here is implicitly
a function of temperature",00:25:50.300,00:25:55.230
"because it is related to density
through that formula N equals",00:25:55.230,00:25:59.380
"to g over lambda
cubed f 5/2 plus of z.",00:25:59.380,00:26:04.450
"So you should not forget to
take the derivative of what",00:26:04.450,00:26:07.760
"is over here with
respect to T. OK?",00:26:07.760,00:26:11.660
"So what do I get when I take a
derivative of this with respect",00:26:11.660,00:26:15.110
to T?,00:26:15.110,00:26:16.110
"Well, the argument
is not T, it is z.",00:26:16.110,00:26:22.230
"So I will have to
take a dz by dT,",00:26:22.230,00:26:25.740
"and then the derivative of
f 5/2 with respect to z.",00:26:25.740,00:26:31.100
"And we saw that one
of the characteristics",00:26:31.100,00:26:33.500
"of these functions
was that when we",00:26:33.500,00:26:35.860
"took the derivative
of each one of them,",00:26:35.860,00:26:39.270
"we generated one with
a lower argument.",00:26:39.270,00:26:42.170
"So the derivative would
be f 3/2 plus of z.",00:26:42.170,00:26:46.270
"But in order to have this
[? latter ?] property,",00:26:46.270,00:26:49.200
"I had to do a z d by
dz, and so I essentially",00:26:49.200,00:26:54.900
"need to restore
this 1 over z here.",00:26:54.900,00:26:59.160
"So you can see that, really,
the difference between what",00:26:59.160,00:27:05.140
"I had at low temperatures
and high temperatures,",00:27:05.140,00:27:10.830
"at low temperatures this was
just a number that I was using",00:27:10.830,00:27:15.110
"over here, zeta of
5/2, and I didn't",00:27:15.110,00:27:17.400
"have to bother about
this other term.",00:27:17.400,00:27:19.407
"Now, we can figure out what
the behavior of this term",00:27:22.270,00:27:27.000
"is certainly at
small z because we",00:27:27.000,00:27:31.350
"have the expansion of
these functions at small z.",00:27:31.350,00:27:34.920
"And if you do sufficient
work, you will find-- well,",00:27:34.920,00:27:40.000
"first of all, at the
largest values of z-- sorry,",00:27:40.000,00:27:44.280
"at the smallest
value, z going to 0,",00:27:44.280,00:27:46.790
"you can confirm that the heat
capacity in units of N kB",00:27:46.790,00:27:52.150
is simply 3/2.,00:27:52.150,00:27:54.060
"So you will come to
this line over here,",00:27:54.060,00:27:57.900
"and then the first correction
that you calculate you'll find",00:27:57.900,00:28:02.610
"is going to take you
in that direction.",00:28:02.610,00:28:06.220
"Actually, if you do the
calculation for bosons",00:28:06.220,00:28:09.730
"and fermions at
high temperatures,",00:28:09.730,00:28:11.960
"you can convince yourself
that while bosons",00:28:11.960,00:28:14.890
"will go in this direction,
fermions, the heat capacity,",00:28:14.890,00:28:18.615
"will start to go in
the other direction.",00:28:18.615,00:28:22.610
"But OK, so you
have this behavior.",00:28:22.610,00:28:25.950
"And then what we
haven't established",00:28:25.950,00:28:28.080
"and the reason that I'm still
doing all of this algebra",00:28:28.080,00:28:31.440
"is that, OK, this
curve is going up,",00:28:31.440,00:28:34.850
where is it going to end up?,00:28:34.850,00:28:37.990
"Is it going to
end up here, here,",00:28:37.990,00:28:40.540
or right where this curve hits?,00:28:40.540,00:28:43.790
OK?,00:28:43.790,00:28:45.080
"And what I will show
you is that this",00:28:45.080,00:28:48.180
"has to end up right
at this point.",00:28:48.180,00:28:54.290
"And actually, in order to
show that, all we need to do",00:28:54.290,00:29:00.440
"is to figure out what these
terms do when I evaluate them",00:29:00.440,00:29:06.540
at z equals to 1.,00:29:06.540,00:29:09.660
"And because these
things are telling",00:29:09.660,00:29:12.690
"me what is happening as I am
approaching to this point,",00:29:12.690,00:29:16.105
"the question that I ask is,
what is the limiting behavior",00:29:16.105,00:29:19.360
"of this function as I
get to z equals to 1?",00:29:19.360,00:29:23.800
"But the limiting value
of this one I know.",00:29:23.800,00:29:26.070
"It is precisely what
I want over here.",00:29:26.070,00:29:28.340
It is zeta of 5/2.,00:29:28.340,00:29:31.110
"So I have to somehow show
you that this next term is 0.",00:29:31.110,00:29:36.572
"Well, this next term,
however, depends on dz by dT.",00:29:36.572,00:29:41.580
How can I get that?,00:29:41.580,00:29:44.110
"Well, all of these things
are done under the conditions",00:29:44.110,00:29:47.170
"where the volume is fixed,
or the number of particles",00:29:47.170,00:29:50.040
"is fixed, if the
density is fixed.",00:29:50.040,00:29:52.390
"So z and T are related
through the formula that",00:29:52.390,00:29:58.090
"says N over V, which
is the density,",00:29:58.090,00:30:03.450
"is g over lambda
cubed f 3/2 plus of z.",00:30:03.450,00:30:09.260
OK?,00:30:09.260,00:30:10.520
"So if I take the system and
I change its temperature,",00:30:10.520,00:30:14.450
"while keeping the number
of particles, volume,",00:30:14.450,00:30:17.540
"fixed so that the
density is fixed,",00:30:17.540,00:30:20.300
"if I take d by dT on both
sides, on the other side",00:30:20.300,00:30:25.270
"I'm assuming that I'm doing the
calculations under conditions",00:30:25.270,00:30:29.550
"where the density
does not change.",00:30:29.550,00:30:31.970
"And then what do
I have over here?",00:30:31.970,00:30:34.740
"I have to take the temperature
derivative of this.",00:30:34.740,00:30:38.030
"There's an implicit
derivative here",00:30:38.030,00:30:40.180
"since this is T to the
3/2 proportionately.",00:30:40.180,00:30:44.280
"So when I take a derivative,
I will get 3 over 2T,",00:30:44.280,00:30:52.150
"and then I will have
f 3/2 plus of z.",00:30:52.150,00:30:59.030
"But then I have to take
the derivative that",00:30:59.030,00:31:03.550
"is implicit in the
dependence on z here.",00:31:03.550,00:31:06.565
"And that's going to
be identical to this,",00:31:06.565,00:31:14.250
"except that when I take
a derivative of f 3/2,",00:31:14.250,00:31:17.960
I will generate f 1/2 of z.,00:31:17.960,00:31:23.660
OK?,00:31:23.660,00:31:25.030
"So since the left-hand
side is equal to 0,",00:31:25.030,00:31:29.690
"I can immediately
solve for this,",00:31:29.690,00:31:31.850
"and I find that T
dz by dT 1 over z",00:31:31.850,00:31:39.590
"is minus 3/2 f 3/2 plus of z
divided by f 1/2 plus of z.",00:31:39.590,00:31:51.920
OK?,00:31:51.920,00:31:54.360
"So essentially, what I can do
is I can multiply through by T.",00:31:54.360,00:32:02.370
"So this T will get rid of this
T. I can bring a T, therefore,",00:32:02.370,00:32:07.740
here.,00:32:07.740,00:32:09.320
"And this combination
over here I can",00:32:09.320,00:32:12.930
"replace from what I have there
with minus 3/2 f 3/2 plus of z",00:32:12.930,00:32:21.510
divided by f 1/2 half plus of z.,00:32:21.510,00:32:24.226
Why is any of this useful?,00:32:27.960,00:32:30.990
"Well, it immediately gives
the answer that I need.",00:32:30.990,00:32:35.340
Why?,00:32:35.340,00:32:37.130
"Because f 1/2 is the
derivative of this function.",00:32:37.130,00:32:44.290
"And you can see that
I drew it so that it",00:32:44.290,00:32:46.590
"has infinite derivative
when z hits 1.",00:32:46.590,00:32:50.620
"And we had indeed said that
this function zeta of m, which",00:32:50.620,00:32:55.930
"is the limit of this
when z goes to 1,",00:32:55.930,00:32:59.640
"only exists for m
that is larger than 1,",00:32:59.640,00:33:03.160
"and it is divergent for
m that is less than 1.",00:33:03.160,00:33:07.840
"So when z hits 1, this
thing goes to infinity,",00:33:07.840,00:33:15.590
and the fraction disappears.,00:33:15.590,00:33:18.720
"And so basically, the
additional correction",00:33:18.720,00:33:22.490
"that you have beyond this
becoming zeta of 5/2,",00:33:22.490,00:33:26.680
"which is what we have
over here, vanishes.",00:33:26.680,00:33:30.290
"So I have shown that, indeed,
whatever this curve is doing,",00:33:30.290,00:33:35.870
"it will hit that point
exactly at Tc of n",00:33:35.870,00:33:43.080
"at the same height as the
low temperature curve.",00:33:43.080,00:33:46.830
"And you can do a certain
amount of work and algebra",00:33:46.830,00:33:51.090
"to show that it goes
there with a finite slope.",00:33:51.090,00:33:56.450
"So that's the shape
of the heat capacity",00:33:56.450,00:33:59.020
"curve for the
Bose-Einstein condensate.",00:33:59.020,00:34:02.317
AUDIENCE: Professor?,00:34:02.317,00:34:03.150
PROFESSOR: Yes?,00:34:03.150,00:34:03.850
"AUDIENCE: So it seems that
f 1/2 goes to infinity,",00:34:03.850,00:34:08.929
"but it's [? on ?] the
half, so it is half",00:34:08.929,00:34:10.967
comes from the [INAUDIBLE] 3.,00:34:10.967,00:34:12.950
So--,00:34:12.950,00:34:13.449
PROFESSOR: Exactly.,00:34:13.449,00:34:14.240
"AUDIENCE: --you have higher
dimensional system, then",00:34:14.240,00:34:16.850
"it seems that [INAUDIBLE] won't
vanish there. [INAUDIBLE].",00:34:16.850,00:34:19.520
"PROFESSOR: So if you have a
higher dimensional system,",00:34:22.739,00:34:26.320
"indeed the situation
would be different.",00:34:26.320,00:34:28.320
"And I guess the borderline
dimension would need to be--",00:34:32.659,00:34:36.170
"since this is a V
over 2 minus 1--",00:34:36.170,00:34:40.261
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:34:40.261,00:34:41.909
"PROFESSOR: V over
2 minus 1 being 1,",00:34:41.909,00:34:44.239
"which is the borderline,
will give you a dc of 4.",00:34:44.239,00:34:46.775
"So something else
happens above 4.",00:34:46.775,00:34:49.040
Yes?,00:34:49.040,00:34:49.830
"AUDIENCE: So it seems that
the nature of this phase",00:34:49.830,00:34:53.870
"transition, indeed it
changes with the dimension.",00:34:53.870,00:34:56.400
"PROFESSOR: Exactly, yes.",00:34:56.400,00:34:57.400
"The nature of this
phase transition",00:34:57.400,00:34:59.014
does depend on [INAUDIBLE].,00:34:59.014,00:35:00.138
Good.,00:35:11.360,00:35:11.860
OK?,00:35:14.811,00:35:15.310
"So we will come back to
this heat capacity curve",00:35:18.460,00:35:24.026
"a little bit later
because I want",00:35:24.026,00:35:27.120
"to now change directions
and not talk about",00:35:27.120,00:35:31.630
"Bose-Einstein condensation
anymore, but about a phenomena",00:35:31.630,00:35:37.650
"that is much more
miraculous in my view,",00:35:37.650,00:35:41.297
and that is superfluidity.,00:35:41.297,00:35:42.380
"So the first thing that is
very interesting about helium",00:35:55.590,00:36:02.350
is its phase diagram.,00:36:02.350,00:36:05.110
"So we are used to
drawing phase diagrams",00:36:05.110,00:36:11.460
"as a function of
pressure and temperature,",00:36:11.460,00:36:15.700
"which have a separation
between a liquid and a gas",00:36:15.700,00:36:21.020
"that terminates at
a critical point.",00:36:21.020,00:36:23.780
"So we have seen something
like this many times, where",00:36:23.780,00:36:29.780
"you have on the low
pressure/high temperature",00:36:29.780,00:36:33.355
side a gas.,00:36:33.355,00:36:35.810
"On the higher pressure/lower
temperature side,",00:36:35.810,00:36:39.186
you have a liquid.,00:36:39.186,00:36:41.170
"And they terminate, this line
of coexistence between the two",00:36:41.170,00:36:46.390
"of them, at a critical point.",00:36:46.390,00:36:48.690
"And for the case of
helium, the critical point",00:36:48.690,00:36:52.990
"occurs roughly at
5.2 degrees Kelvin",00:36:52.990,00:36:57.660
"and something like
2.6 atmospheres.",00:36:57.660,00:36:59.570
OK?,00:37:03.784,00:37:04.750
"So far, nothing different from,
say, liquid water, for example,",00:37:04.750,00:37:11.650
"and steam, except that
for all other substances,",00:37:11.650,00:37:16.110
"when we cool it at the
low enough temperatures,",00:37:16.110,00:37:19.140
"we go past the triple point,
and then we have a solid phase.",00:37:19.140,00:37:24.140
"For the case of
helium, it stays liquid",00:37:24.140,00:37:28.450
"all the way down
to 0 temperature.",00:37:28.450,00:37:32.270
"If you put sufficiently
high pressure on it,",00:37:32.270,00:37:34.990
"ultimately it will
become a solid.",00:37:34.990,00:37:37.300
"But at normal pressures--
so this maximal pressure",00:37:41.570,00:37:45.570
"is something of the
order of 26 atmosphere.",00:37:45.570,00:37:50.210
"For pressures that are
less than 26 atmosphere,",00:37:50.210,00:37:54.600
"you can cool the liquid all
the way down to 0 temperature,",00:37:54.600,00:37:58.530
and it stays happily a liquid.,00:37:58.530,00:38:02.100
"So let's think about
why that is the case.",00:38:02.100,00:38:06.340
"Well, why do things typically
become solids anyway?",00:38:06.340,00:38:11.510
"The reason is that if I
think about the interaction",00:38:11.510,00:38:15.110
"that I have between two objects,
two atoms and molecules,",00:38:15.110,00:38:20.310
"we have discussed
this in connection",00:38:20.310,00:38:23.750
"with condensation
before that what",00:38:23.750,00:38:28.470
"we have is that at
very large separations",00:38:28.470,00:38:33.690
"there is a van der
Waals' attraction.",00:38:33.690,00:38:36.450
"Typically, the dipole
moments of these atoms",00:38:36.450,00:38:42.400
"would be fluctuating, and the
fluctuations would somehow",00:38:42.400,00:38:45.900
"align them temporarily
in the manner",00:38:45.900,00:38:48.170
that the energy can be reduced.,00:38:48.170,00:38:51.220
"At very short distances, the
electronic clouds will overlap,",00:38:51.220,00:38:55.625
"and so you would have
something such as this.",00:38:55.625,00:38:59.710
"And then, typically, you
will have the function that",00:38:59.710,00:39:04.590
"joins them and look
something like this.",00:39:04.590,00:39:08.628
OK?,00:39:08.628,00:39:10.970
"And this is no different
for the case of helium.",00:39:10.970,00:39:15.380
"You have here essentially
a hard core appearing",00:39:15.380,00:39:20.620
"at the distance that is of
the order of 2.6 angstroms.",00:39:20.620,00:39:25.220
"There is a minimum that is
of the order of 3 angstroms.",00:39:25.220,00:39:28.240
"Now, the depth of this potential
is not very big for helium.",00:39:33.160,00:39:36.685
"It is only of the order
of, say, 9 degrees Kelvin.",00:39:36.685,00:39:43.270
"And the reason is that the
strength of this van der Waals'",00:39:43.270,00:39:49.930
"attraction is proportional
to the polarizability that",00:39:49.930,00:39:54.700
"scales typically with
the number of electrons",00:39:54.700,00:39:57.310
that you have in your atom.,00:39:57.310,00:39:59.080
"And so it is, in
fact, proportional",00:39:59.080,00:40:01.730
to your atomic number squared.,00:40:01.730,00:40:06.010
"And with the
exception of hydrogen,",00:40:06.010,00:40:10.140
"this is going to be
the smallest value",00:40:10.140,00:40:13.000
"that you are going to get for
the van der Waals' attraction.",00:40:13.000,00:40:16.360
"And hydrogen does not count
because it forms a molecule.",00:40:16.360,00:40:21.070
"So helium does not
form a molecule.",00:40:21.070,00:40:24.890
"You have these [? balls. ?]
They have these attractions.",00:40:24.890,00:40:27.685
"Now, typically
things become solid",00:40:27.685,00:40:30.020
"as you go to 0
temperature is because you",00:40:30.020,00:40:32.750
"can find the minimum energy
in which you put everybody",00:40:32.750,00:40:36.130
"at the minimum
energy separation.",00:40:36.130,00:40:39.240
So you form a lattice.,00:40:39.240,00:40:40.450
"Everybody is around
this separation,",00:40:40.450,00:40:43.430
"and they're all happy and that
solid minimizes the energy.",00:40:43.430,00:40:47.680
"So why doesn't helium
do the same thing?",00:40:47.680,00:40:52.530
"Maybe it should just do
it at a lower temperature",00:40:52.530,00:40:55.200
"because the scale
of this is lower.",00:40:55.200,00:40:57.680
"Again, the reason
it doesn't do that",00:40:57.680,00:40:59.350
is because of quantum mechanics.,00:40:59.350,00:41:02.070
"Because you can
say that, really,",00:41:02.070,00:41:05.510
"I cannot specify exactly where
the particle are because that",00:41:05.510,00:41:11.200
would violate quantum mechanics.,00:41:11.200,00:41:13.550
"There has to be some
uncertainty delta x.",00:41:13.550,00:41:16.650
"And associated
with delta x there",00:41:19.590,00:41:22.380
"is going to be some kind of
a typical momentum, which",00:41:22.380,00:41:25.950
is h bar over delta x.,00:41:25.950,00:41:28.490
"And there will be
some contribution",00:41:28.490,00:41:32.240
"to the kinetic
energy of particles",00:41:32.240,00:41:35.230
"due to this uncertainty in
delta x that is of this form.",00:41:35.230,00:41:41.140
"And if I make the
localization more precise,",00:41:41.140,00:41:47.540
"I have to pay a higher
cost in kinetic energy.",00:41:47.540,00:41:51.910
"Well, presumably the
scale of the energies",00:41:51.910,00:41:54.940
"that I can tolerate and still
keep these things localized",00:41:54.940,00:41:59.960
"is of the order of this
binding energy, which",00:41:59.960,00:42:08.780
"is of the order of, as we
said, 9 or 10 degrees Kelvin.",00:42:08.780,00:42:13.980
Let's say 10 degrees Kelvin.,00:42:13.980,00:42:16.263
OK?,00:42:16.263,00:42:16.763
"Now, the other property
that distinguishes helium",00:42:20.700,00:42:24.260
"from krypton and, let's say,
all the other noble gases",00:42:24.260,00:42:29.870
is that its mass is very small.,00:42:29.870,00:42:33.370
"So because this mass is small,
this uncertainty in energy",00:42:33.370,00:42:37.880
becomes comparatively larger.,00:42:37.880,00:42:40.346
OK?,00:42:40.346,00:42:41.260
"And so if you put the
mass of the helium here",00:42:41.260,00:42:44.590
"and you use this
value of 10 degrees",00:42:44.590,00:42:48.450
"K converted to the
appropriate energy units,",00:42:48.450,00:42:51.600
"you ask what kind
of a delta x would",00:42:51.600,00:42:55.280
"be compatible with this
kind of binding energy,",00:42:55.280,00:42:58.090
"you find that the
delta x that you get",00:42:58.090,00:43:00.230
"is of the order
of 0.5 angstroms.",00:43:00.230,00:43:08.140
OK?,00:43:08.140,00:43:09.630
"So basically, you cannot
keep this in the bottom",00:43:09.630,00:43:13.470
"of the potential if you have
uncertainty that is of this",00:43:13.470,00:43:17.410
order.,00:43:17.410,00:43:19.330
"So the atoms of helium cannot
form a nice lattice and stay",00:43:19.330,00:43:27.220
"in order because that registry
would violate the quantum",00:43:27.220,00:43:32.500
uncertainty principle.,00:43:32.500,00:43:33.860
They are moving around.,00:43:33.860,00:43:35.350
"And so you have
a system that has",00:43:35.350,00:43:37.860
"been [? melted ?] due
to quantum fluctuations",00:43:37.860,00:43:41.790
"rather than thermal
fluctuations.",00:43:41.790,00:43:45.050
OK?,00:43:45.050,00:43:47.060
"So that's all nice,
except that something",00:43:47.060,00:43:52.500
"does happen when
you cool helium.",00:43:52.500,00:43:56.370
"And actually, it is interesting
that helium provides us",00:43:56.370,00:44:00.870
"not only with one liquid that
persists all the way to 0",00:44:00.870,00:44:05.060
"temperature, but two
liquids because helium",00:44:05.060,00:44:09.480
has two isotopes.,00:44:09.480,00:44:10.370
"There is helium-4, which
is the abundant one,",00:44:14.978,00:44:19.010
"and there is helium-3, which is
a much less available isotope.",00:44:19.010,00:44:27.304
"But the number of
protons being different",00:44:27.304,00:44:31.470
"in the nucleus of these means
that helium-4 is a boson,",00:44:31.470,00:44:37.290
while helium-3 is fermion.,00:44:37.290,00:44:38.870
"So we have the opportunity to
observe both a Bose system that",00:44:42.730,00:44:47.450
"is liquid at low
temperature and a Fermi",00:44:47.450,00:44:50.260
"liquid at [INAUDIBLE]
temperatures.",00:44:50.260,00:44:53.210
"Now, the case of
the Fermi liquid",00:44:53.210,00:44:55.380
"is not really that
different in principle",00:44:55.380,00:44:59.180
"from the Fermi liquid of
the electrons in copper",00:44:59.180,00:45:02.065
that we already discussed.,00:45:02.065,00:45:03.630
There are some subtleties.,00:45:03.630,00:45:05.910
"In the case of the
bosons, [? well, ?]",00:45:05.910,00:45:09.780
"we saw that for bosons
there is potentially",00:45:09.780,00:45:12.660
this kind of phase transition.,00:45:12.660,00:45:15.970
"In reality, what
happens is that helium",00:45:15.970,00:45:21.640
"has a transition
between two forms",00:45:21.640,00:45:25.090
"of the liquid at
a temperature that",00:45:25.090,00:45:27.900
"is of the order of
2.18 degrees Kelvin.",00:45:27.900,00:45:32.870
"So we can call this helium
I and this helium II,",00:45:32.870,00:45:39.795
"OK, two different forms of the
helium-4 liquid that you have.",00:45:39.795,00:45:46.990
"So how was this
seen experimentally?",00:45:46.990,00:45:50.473
"I kind of told you how
in these experiments",00:46:00.630,00:46:04.410
"of the Bose-Einstein
condensation,",00:46:04.410,00:46:07.110
"part of the way that
they cooled the system",00:46:07.110,00:46:10.510
"was to remove the
high-energy particles,",00:46:10.510,00:46:14.530
"and the remaining
particles cooled down.",00:46:14.530,00:46:17.300
"So that's the common
method that actually people",00:46:17.300,00:46:20.810
use for cooling various things.,00:46:20.810,00:46:22.720
"It's called evaporative--
evaporative cooling.",00:46:22.720,00:46:28.890
"And for the case of helium, it
is actually reasonably simple",00:46:33.450,00:46:38.285
to draw what it is.,00:46:38.285,00:46:39.720
"You have a bath that is full
of helium that is reasonably",00:46:42.690,00:46:53.890
"nicely thermally isolated
from the environment.",00:46:53.890,00:46:59.000
"So you want to cool it,
remove the energy from it.",00:46:59.000,00:47:03.560
"And the thing that you do
is you pump out the gas.",00:47:03.560,00:47:10.760
OK?,00:47:10.760,00:47:13.240
"So this is a coexistence
because this part",00:47:13.240,00:47:22.670
"up here on top of the
liquid helium is not vacuum.",00:47:22.670,00:47:26.760
"What happens is that there
is evaporation of helium,",00:47:26.760,00:47:34.050
"leaving the liquid and
going into the gas.",00:47:34.050,00:47:38.600
"And once they are in the
gas, they are pumped out.",00:47:38.600,00:47:43.350
"But every time you
grab a helium from here",00:47:43.350,00:47:47.520
"to put it into the gas,
you've essentially taken it",00:47:47.520,00:47:51.530
"from down here and
moved it to infinity,",00:47:51.530,00:47:55.780
"so you lose this amount
of binding energy.",00:47:55.780,00:47:59.460
It's called latent heat.,00:47:59.460,00:48:02.020
"Essentially, this
is the latent heat,",00:48:02.020,00:48:04.840
"and it is actually of
the order of 7 degrees",00:48:04.840,00:48:08.440
"Kelvin because
typically it has to be",00:48:08.440,00:48:10.890
"the depth of the typical
positions of these particles.",00:48:10.890,00:48:14.750
OK?,00:48:14.750,00:48:15.510
"So for each atom
that you pump out,",00:48:15.510,00:48:20.080
"you have reduced
the total energy",00:48:20.080,00:48:22.880
"that you have in the liquid,
and the liquid cools down.",00:48:22.880,00:48:27.040
And what is the trajectory?,00:48:27.040,00:48:29.500
"You always actually remain
on this coexistence line.",00:48:29.500,00:48:34.810
The pressure is changing.,00:48:34.810,00:48:36.140
The temperature is lowering.,00:48:36.140,00:48:37.670
"But you're always remaining
on the coexistence",00:48:37.670,00:48:40.840
of the gas and liquid line.,00:48:40.840,00:48:44.220
"So you follow what is
happening over here,",00:48:44.220,00:48:47.880
"and you find that as you
are approaching here,",00:48:47.880,00:48:51.560
"suddenly this system
starts to bubble up.",00:48:51.560,00:48:57.320
"It is just like having a
kettle that is boiling.",00:48:57.320,00:49:02.670
"Indeed, it is, again, in
like the case of kettle,",00:49:02.670,00:49:05.860
"there are these bubbles that
are carrying the steam that",00:49:05.860,00:49:09.650
"is going to go over here
and being pulled out,",00:49:09.650,00:49:12.140
and so it is bubbling.,00:49:12.140,00:49:14.480
"And then suddenly, [INAUDIBLE]
heat 2.18 degrees Kelvin,",00:49:14.480,00:49:19.100
and the whole thing quiets down.,00:49:19.100,00:49:22.680
"And below that, it stays quiet.",00:49:22.680,00:49:26.242
"And so let's see if
we can show that.",00:49:26.242,00:49:28.830
We saw the phase diagram.,00:49:40.031,00:49:41.760
So this is the liquid.,00:49:52.810,00:49:54.605
"Let's see if we can
get the sound also.",00:49:57.385,00:49:59.486

PROFESSOR: Everything quiets.,00:50:14.972,00:50:16.180
"--[INAUDIBLE] stops and that the
surface of the liquid helium is",00:50:16.180,00:50:19.391
completely still.,00:50:19.391,00:50:21.194
"The temperature is actually
being lowered even further now,",00:50:21.194,00:50:23.652
but nothing is happening.,00:50:23.652,00:50:25.460
"Well, this is really one
of the great phenomenon",00:50:25.460,00:50:28.582
in 20th-century physics.,00:50:28.582,00:50:31.827
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:50:31.827,00:50:32.410
"I'll show you this movie
at the next lecture.",00:50:32.410,00:50:38.695
"But this is just a
segment of it that",00:50:41.220,00:50:43.970
"shows the important property
of this fluid, helium II, which",00:50:43.970,00:50:50.040
is the superfluid.,00:50:50.040,00:50:51.270
"So now you're above the
temperature it was boiling,",00:50:51.270,00:50:54.850
but it quieted down.,00:50:54.850,00:50:56.560
"You can see that
the fluid started",00:50:56.560,00:50:58.600
"to go through the
capillaries that",00:50:58.600,00:51:01.390
were at the bottom of this.,00:51:01.390,00:51:03.460
"So at the bottom of this glass
there were fine capillaries.",00:51:03.460,00:51:07.510
"As long as you were up
here, the capillaries",00:51:07.510,00:51:11.380
"were sufficient to
keep the fluid above.",00:51:11.380,00:51:14.690
"Once you went below,
the fluid went through",00:51:14.690,00:51:18.370
as if there is no resistance.,00:51:18.370,00:51:21.060
"And that's the
superfluid property.",00:51:21.060,00:51:25.690
"-Superfluidity and
superconductivity were baffling",00:51:25.690,00:51:28.331
concepts for scien--,00:51:28.331,00:51:29.656
[END PLAYBACK],00:51:29.656,00:51:30.239
"PROFESSOR: OK, we'll
go back to that later.",00:51:30.239,00:51:34.010
"So let's list some
of the properties",00:51:34.010,00:51:38.090
of this superfluid state.,00:51:38.090,00:51:41.705
OK.,00:52:03.020,00:52:04.850
"So what this last
experiment showed",00:52:04.850,00:52:12.140
"is that it appears to
have zero viscosity.",00:52:12.140,00:52:16.175
"So what's the way that
you would calculate",00:52:21.350,00:52:24.940
the viscosity of a fluid?,00:52:24.940,00:52:27.770
"And one way to sort
of do that relies on",00:52:27.770,00:52:35.660
"like what we had over
here, passing the fluid",00:52:35.660,00:52:41.550
through some pore or capillary.,00:52:41.550,00:52:44.720
"In the case of this
experiment, you",00:52:44.720,00:52:46.500
"have to really make this
capillary extremely fine",00:52:46.500,00:52:50.500
"so that practically
nothing will go through it.",00:52:50.500,00:52:53.990
"But this could be
a quite general way",00:52:53.990,00:52:55.770
"of measuring viscosity
of some fluid.",00:52:55.770,00:53:01.120
So you have some fluid.,00:53:01.120,00:53:04.710
"You can measure its
viscosity by trying",00:53:04.710,00:53:09.330
"to pass it through a
capillary by exerting pressure",00:53:09.330,00:53:14.650
"on one side and measuring,
in essence, the difference",00:53:14.650,00:53:19.580
"between the two pressures
that you have on the two sides",00:53:19.580,00:53:23.340
"as a measure of the force
that you are exerting on this.",00:53:23.340,00:53:27.005
"And once you do that,
then these pistons enhance",00:53:27.005,00:53:30.790
"the velocity--
sorry, the fluid, are",00:53:30.790,00:53:33.660
"moving through with
some kind of velocity.",00:53:33.660,00:53:37.430
"And some measure of
viscosity, after you",00:53:37.430,00:53:43.100
"divide by various things that
have dimensions of length",00:53:43.100,00:53:46.780
"and pressure, et
cetera, would be related",00:53:46.780,00:53:49.980
"to the velocity
divided by delta P--",00:53:49.980,00:53:54.275
"is to achieve the same velocity,
how much pressure difference",00:53:54.275,00:53:58.470
you have to put.,00:53:58.470,00:54:00.990
"Now, for this experiment
of superfluid helium,",00:54:00.990,00:54:05.680
"you'll find that essentially
you can get a finite velocity",00:54:05.680,00:54:10.500
"by typically infinitesimal
pressure difference.",00:54:10.500,00:54:14.240
"So when you try to use this
method to calculate viscosity,",00:54:14.240,00:54:19.520
"you find that, to whatever
precision you can measure,",00:54:19.520,00:54:24.210
"essentially this value of eta
is not distinguishable from 0.",00:54:24.210,00:54:28.130
OK?,00:54:30.660,00:54:31.670
Yes?,00:54:31.670,00:54:32.521
"AUDIENCE: The way you defined
it, it would be infinity?",00:54:32.521,00:54:36.369
"PROFESSOR: Then I
probably defined it--",00:54:36.369,00:54:39.480
"[? no? ?] Delta P goes to 0 for
a finite V. Yes, so viscosity--",00:54:39.480,00:54:47.730
"AUDIENCE: So what
you're essentially",00:54:47.730,00:54:49.230
"writing is the
Reynolds number, yeah?",00:54:49.230,00:54:51.194
PROFESSOR: Exactly.,00:54:51.194,00:54:52.126
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:54:52.126,00:54:52.667
PROFESSOR: All right?,00:55:02.500,00:55:04.820
"But there is another
experiment that",00:55:04.820,00:55:07.460
"appears to indicate that
there is a finite viscosity,",00:55:07.460,00:55:16.050
"and that is a famous experiment
due to Andronikashvili.",00:55:16.050,00:55:20.070
"And basically, this is
the other experiment.",00:55:25.760,00:55:31.815
"You imagine that you put your
fluid inside a container.",00:55:31.815,00:55:40.950
"And then you insert in this
container a set of plates,",00:55:40.950,00:55:49.320
"could be copper plates
or something else,",00:55:49.320,00:55:52.670
"that are stacked on
top of each other.",00:55:52.670,00:55:54.900
"So essentially, you have a
stack of these plates that",00:55:59.076,00:56:06.366
"have a common axis,
and there's a rod",00:56:06.366,00:56:11.730
that is going through them.,00:56:11.730,00:56:14.870
"And what you created here
is a torsional oscillator",00:56:14.870,00:56:24.930
"in the sense that this rod
that holds all of these things",00:56:24.930,00:56:30.220
"together has a particular
preferred orientation.",00:56:30.220,00:56:35.780
"And if you start, let's
say-- well, it may or may not",00:56:35.780,00:56:45.670
"have a particular orientation--
but if you start to rotate it,",00:56:45.670,00:56:55.290
"it will certainly have
a moment of inertia that",00:56:55.290,00:57:00.050
"resists the rotation that is
coming from all of the plates",00:57:00.050,00:57:08.830
if it was in vacuum.,00:57:08.830,00:57:11.550
"So if I could measure the moment
of inertia of these objects,",00:57:11.550,00:57:15.900
"either through torsion
or some other mechanism,",00:57:15.900,00:57:19.800
"if it is a torsional
oscillator I",00:57:19.800,00:57:21.840
"could figure out what
the frequency is.",00:57:21.840,00:57:24.530
"If I knew the
[? spinning ?] constant",00:57:24.530,00:57:27.000
"that wants to bring the angle
to some particular value,",00:57:27.000,00:57:30.920
"I would divide that by
the moment of inertia.",00:57:30.920,00:57:33.600
"The square root of that
would give me the frequency.",00:57:33.600,00:57:36.400
"So the frequency is a measure
of the moment of inertia.",00:57:36.400,00:57:40.390
"So if I had this
thing in vacuum,",00:57:40.390,00:57:42.380
"I could figure out
what the moment",00:57:42.380,00:57:44.050
"of inertia of all
of the plates was.",00:57:44.050,00:57:47.310
"Now, if I add the fluid to this,
then as I start to rotate this,",00:57:47.310,00:57:55.340
"some of the fluid will
certainly move with the plates.",00:57:55.340,00:57:59.480
"And so the moment of inertia
that you would measure",00:57:59.480,00:58:02.120
"in the presence of
the fluid is larger",00:58:02.120,00:58:04.840
"than it is in the
absence of fluid.",00:58:04.840,00:58:07.920
"And that additional
moment of inertia",00:58:07.920,00:58:11.500
"tells you about how much of
the fluid is, in some sense,",00:58:11.500,00:58:15.270
"stuck to the plates, and that's
another different measure",00:58:15.270,00:58:19.200
of the viscosity.,00:58:19.200,00:58:21.650
OK?,00:58:21.650,00:58:22.890
"So if we sort of look
at this experiment,",00:58:22.890,00:58:29.560
"we would imagine that if I
measure the moment of inertia",00:58:29.560,00:58:36.200
"as a function of
temperature, something",00:58:36.200,00:58:44.130

the plates plus the fluid",00:58:54.420,00:58:58.470
"that is moving
around, [? we do. ?]",00:58:58.470,00:59:01.580
"But what happens
when you hit Tc?",00:59:01.580,00:59:05.400
"If the superfluid doesn't
care about things around it,",00:59:05.400,00:59:11.050
"you would imagine that this
would drop down to the value",00:59:11.050,00:59:14.020
that it has in vacuum.,00:59:14.020,00:59:17.270
"In reality, what it does
is something like this.",00:59:17.270,00:59:20.350
"So it does go to
the value that you",00:59:23.090,00:59:26.170
"would have in vacuum but
only at 0 temperature.",00:59:26.170,00:59:31.750
"So at any finite
temperature we know Tc.",00:59:31.750,00:59:38.280
"There is indeed some
fraction of the superfluid",00:59:38.280,00:59:44.220
that is trapped by these plates.,00:59:44.220,00:59:48.660

"OK, so this is one [INAUDIBLE].",00:59:50.472,00:59:52.600
"The other property-- maybe I
will squeeze it somewhere here.",00:59:56.150,01:00:02.330
"There are a whole
bunch of things",01:00:27.590,01:00:30.230
"that indicate that there is a
coupling between temperature",01:00:30.230,01:00:35.150
"and mechanical properties,
so-called thermo-mechanical",01:00:35.150,01:00:42.471
couplings.,01:00:42.471,01:00:42.970
"What you find in this
experiment, where",01:00:49.520,01:00:57.990
"the fluid spontaneously
goes, let's",01:00:57.990,01:01:01.730
"say, from this
side to this side,",01:01:01.730,01:01:05.620
"so the direction
is like this, is",01:01:05.620,01:01:09.080
"that when you measure
the temperatures",01:01:09.080,01:01:11.680
"you will find that the
temperature of this one",01:01:11.680,01:01:13.890
"goes up, and the temperature
of this one goes down.",01:01:13.890,01:01:19.540
"So somehow the motion led to
some temperature differences.",01:01:19.540,01:01:28.380
"A dramatic one that, again,
maybe we'll show in the movie",01:01:28.380,01:01:31.830
"next time is the
fountain effect.",01:01:31.830,01:01:34.540
"What you do is you--
let's imagine that,",01:01:38.540,01:01:42.300
"again, you have a vat of
helium, and inside of it",01:01:42.300,01:01:49.010
"you put a tube that is,
let's say, shaped like this.",01:01:49.010,01:01:55.010
"And you have the fluid that
is occupying everything here.",01:01:55.010,01:02:03.930
"Then inside this tube,
you put some material",01:02:03.930,01:02:10.160
"that is a good absorber of
heat, such as, let's say,",01:02:10.160,01:02:13.280
"a piece of carbon, and
then you shine laser",01:02:13.280,01:02:18.770
"on it so that this
thing becomes hot.",01:02:18.770,01:02:24.380
"So in this case, the
temperature goes up,",01:02:24.380,01:02:28.380
"and what you find happens
is that the fluid will",01:02:28.380,01:02:34.740
"start to shoot up
here like a fountain.",01:02:34.740,01:02:37.500
"It's called the fountain
effect because of that.",01:02:37.500,01:02:40.270
"And essentially, whereas
here pressure was converted",01:02:40.270,01:02:45.640
"to temperature, here
temperature, the heating,",01:02:45.640,01:02:50.130
gets converted to pressure.,01:02:50.130,01:02:52.460
"So this is like-- I
don't know if you've ever",01:02:52.460,01:02:54.440
"done this, where you put
your hand under water,",01:02:54.440,01:02:57.610
"and if you squeeze your hand
and the water shoots up.",01:02:57.610,01:03:01.160
"So it's kind of putting pressure
here, causing a fountain that",01:03:01.160,01:03:05.080
is shooting up like that.,01:03:05.080,01:03:07.860
OK?,01:03:07.860,01:03:08.360
"So there is this coupling
between temperature",01:03:08.360,01:03:13.890
"and-- actually, this issue
of boiling-not boiling",01:03:13.890,01:03:19.000
"is also a manifestation of a
coupling between temperature",01:03:19.000,01:03:22.910

is whether the fluid is boiling",01:03:22.910,01:03:26.200

most important one, although I",01:05:11.130,01:05:19.350
"guess at the beginning of
the story they didn't know",01:05:19.350,01:05:21.850

Bose-Einstein temperature is.",01:06:00.990,01:06:04.660

that was n lambda",01:06:04.660,01:06:09.620
cubed is equal to zeta of 3/2.,01:06:09.620,01:06:15.350
"So that gives you some
value of kB Tc being h",01:06:15.350,01:06:23.820
"squared 2 pi mass of helium,
and then you have a zeta of 3/2",01:06:23.820,01:06:32.320

proportional to n zeta of 3/2",01:07:05.510,01:07:16.874
to the 2/3 power.,01:07:16.874,01:07:19.530
OK.,01:07:19.530,01:07:21.230
"So I had a picture here, which
was the typical attraction",01:07:21.230,01:07:28.570
potential.,01:07:28.570,01:07:30.000
"The typical separation
of helium atoms",01:07:30.000,01:07:33.330
is something like 3.6 angstroms.,01:07:33.330,01:07:36.700
"How do I know that is because
the density I can figure out",01:07:36.700,01:07:41.050
"is typically 1 over the
volume per particle,",01:07:41.050,01:07:45.390
"and this volume per particle
is roughly 3.6 angstroms cubed.",01:07:45.390,01:07:51.460
"It's something like
46.2 angstrom cubed.",01:07:51.460,01:07:55.050

value of n over here.",01:07:55.050,01:07:58.660
"I know what the
mass of helium is.",01:07:58.660,01:08:01.280
"And I can figure
out what this Tc is,",01:08:01.280,01:08:05.010

degrees K. You say, well, it's",01:08:05.010,01:08:11.490
"not exactly the 2 pi and
something that we had.",01:08:11.490,01:08:17.970
"But given that we completely
ignored the interactions",01:08:17.970,01:08:22.520

this is actually very good.",01:08:27.930,01:08:32.319
"You would say, OK, this is
roughly in the right range.",01:08:32.319,01:08:35.660
"And presumably if
I were to include",01:08:35.660,01:08:38.340
"the effects of
interactions, potentially I",01:08:38.340,01:08:42.620
"will get an interaction,
temperature,",01:08:42.620,01:08:46.204
that is roughly correct.,01:08:46.204,01:08:48.819
So this is another reason.,01:08:48.819,01:08:53.540
"The third reason is that
you have automatically,",01:08:53.540,01:09:00.430
"when you are talking about the
Bose-Einstein condensation,",01:09:00.430,01:09:04.330
"a relationship between
pressure and temperature.",01:09:04.330,01:09:07.910

formula that we had",01:09:07.910,01:09:09.950
"for the Bose-Einstein
condensation,",01:09:09.950,01:09:11.790

"1 over lambda cubed
zeta of 5/2, right?",01:09:16.189,01:09:22.470
"So once you specify
the temperature,",01:09:22.470,01:09:25.479
"you've also specified
the pressure.",01:09:25.479,01:09:28.970
They go hand in hand.,01:09:28.970,01:09:31.410
"So then you can start to explain
a lot of these phenomena,",01:09:31.410,01:09:35.370
"such as here you
increase the temperature,",01:09:35.370,01:09:39.109
"pressure had to go up, and
it was the increased pressure",01:09:39.109,01:09:42.359
than did that.,01:09:42.359,01:09:43.569
"It kind of tells you
something about what",01:09:43.569,01:09:46.304
"is going on in this
experiment over here,",01:09:46.304,01:09:49.729
"where the temperature goes up
where you have higher pressure.",01:09:49.729,01:09:54.310
"It actually also
explains why things",01:09:54.310,01:09:58.120
"stop bubbling when you
go into the superfluid.",01:09:58.120,01:10:02.250
"Because let's back
out and think of why",01:10:02.250,01:10:04.960
"things are bubbling when you put
your kettle on top of the oven.",01:10:04.960,01:10:09.515
"And the reason is that there
are variations in temperature.",01:10:09.515,01:10:14.000
"There could be a local
hotspot over here,",01:10:14.000,01:10:17.600
"and in this local
hotspot, eventually there",01:10:17.600,01:10:20.770
"will a bubble that forms,
and the bubble goes away.",01:10:20.770,01:10:25.580
"Why is it that it forms here
is because heat gets spread out",01:10:25.580,01:10:32.400
through diffusion.,01:10:32.400,01:10:34.370
"If I strike a match or even
if I have a blow torch here,",01:10:34.370,01:10:40.180
"you won't feel the
heat for some time.",01:10:40.180,01:10:43.750
"But if I do this, you
hear my hand clapping",01:10:43.750,01:10:49.410
much more rapidly.,01:10:49.410,01:10:51.060
"So pressure gets transmitted
very efficiently through sound,",01:10:51.060,01:10:57.920
"whereas heat goes very
slowly through diffusion.",01:10:57.920,01:11:01.870
"And that's why when you
boil something, essentially",01:11:01.870,01:11:06.710
"you will have the diffusion of
heat, local hotspots, bubbles.",01:11:06.710,01:11:11.880
"But if temperature changes are
connected to pressure changes,",01:11:11.880,01:11:18.740
"then for the superfluid,
having a local hotspot",01:11:18.740,01:11:21.760
is like doing this.,01:11:21.760,01:11:23.770
"It creates immediately
a pressure change,",01:11:23.770,01:11:26.800
"and pressure changes
are rapidly taken away.",01:11:26.800,01:11:29.926
"And that's why this
could also explain",01:11:29.926,01:11:33.380
what's going on over here.,01:11:33.380,01:11:34.610
"So I think this number two was
first noted by Fritz London.",01:11:38.370,01:11:45.350
"Maybe we'll talk about that
a bit more next time around.",01:11:45.350,01:11:49.330
"Based on all of
these similarities,",01:11:49.330,01:11:55.630
"Laszlo Tisza, who
spent many years at MIT",01:11:55.630,01:12:02.200
"after being in Europe,
proposed the two-fluid model.",01:12:02.200,01:12:08.100
"So again, roughly
inspired by what",01:12:14.390,01:12:16.790
"we saw for the case of the
Bose-Einstein condensate,",01:12:16.790,01:12:21.570
"we saw that for the
Bose-Einstein condensate,",01:12:21.570,01:12:23.950
"below Tc you had to
make a separation",01:12:23.950,01:12:27.940
"for the number of things that
were in the ground state,",01:12:27.940,01:12:33.970
"k equals to 0, and
all of the others",01:12:33.970,01:12:37.280
"that were in the
higher excited states.",01:12:37.280,01:12:40.180
"Pressure, heat
capacity, everything",01:12:40.180,01:12:44.130
"came from the excited component,
whereas the component that",01:12:44.130,01:12:48.950
"was at the k equals to 0 state
was not making any contribution",01:12:48.950,01:12:53.230
to these phenomena.,01:12:53.230,01:12:55.300
"So what he proposed
was that somehow,",01:12:55.300,01:12:58.860
"again, similarly when you
are in the superfluid,",01:12:58.860,01:13:03.870
"you really have two
components, two fluids",01:13:03.870,01:13:06.670
that are in coexistence.,01:13:06.670,01:13:08.790
"There is a superfluid
component, and there",01:13:08.790,01:13:11.800
is a normal component.,01:13:11.800,01:13:15.130
"And as you change temperature,
these two components",01:13:15.130,01:13:22.030
get converted to each other.,01:13:22.030,01:13:24.570
"So just like the case of the
Bose-Einstein condensate,",01:13:24.570,01:13:28.000
"it is not like you have
so many of this fluid, so",01:13:28.000,01:13:31.800
many of that fluid.,01:13:31.800,01:13:33.460
"These two things are
always interchanging.",01:13:33.460,01:13:37.170
"And then what is happening
in this experiment,",01:13:37.170,01:13:40.920
"presumably, is that the
superfluid component",01:13:40.920,01:13:45.600
"goes through, the normal
component leaves behind.",01:13:45.600,01:13:50.450
"The superfluid component is the
component that, in some sense,",01:13:50.450,01:13:54.140
"has less entropy, is
at lower temperature.",01:13:54.140,01:13:57.550
"So when it goes here,
it cools down this part.",01:13:57.550,01:14:00.990
"This part then goes
up in temperature.",01:14:00.990,01:14:04.890
"Again, there is no way that you
can push all of the superfluid",01:14:04.890,01:14:09.900
"here and have normal here
because these things get",01:14:09.900,01:14:13.410
converted.,01:14:13.410,01:14:14.040
"So some amount of superfluid
goes through here.",01:14:14.040,01:14:17.520
"Some amount gets converted
from the normal back",01:14:17.520,01:14:20.160
to the superfluid.,01:14:20.160,01:14:21.000
"So there is this exchange
that is constantly",01:14:21.000,01:14:24.120
taking place in the system.,01:14:24.120,01:14:26.170
"And so on the basis of
this model and having",01:14:26.170,01:14:32.260
"different velocities for
the normal and superfluid",01:14:32.260,01:14:36.070
"component, Tisza could explain
a number of these things.",01:14:36.070,01:14:41.940
OK?,01:14:41.940,01:14:44.750
"So I will mention some
important differences",01:14:44.750,01:14:59.240
"at the end of this lecture
and leave their resolution",01:14:59.240,01:15:03.750
for next.,01:15:03.750,01:15:05.030
"So while those were similarities
between BEC and superfluidity,",01:15:05.030,01:15:10.470
"there are very
important differences.",01:15:10.470,01:15:12.280
"One important
observation immediately",01:15:31.780,01:15:36.080
"is that if I try to compress
superfluid helium or normal",01:15:36.080,01:15:46.880
"helium, it doesn't matter.",01:15:46.880,01:15:48.230
"It is just like
trying to compress",01:15:48.230,01:15:50.810
any other fluid such as water.,01:15:50.810,01:15:53.222
It does not like to be squeezed.,01:15:53.222,01:15:58.300
"So helium liquid is
approximately, of course",01:15:58.300,01:16:05.900
"not entirely,
incompressible, while BEC, we",01:16:05.900,01:16:20.710
"saw that the pressure is only
a function of temperature.",01:16:20.710,01:16:24.770
"It doesn't know anything
about the density.",01:16:24.770,01:16:28.020
So you can change the density.,01:16:28.020,01:16:35.610
"All of the additional
particles will",01:16:35.610,01:16:37.870
"go to go to the k
equals to 0 state.",01:16:37.870,01:16:39.740
It doesn't really care.,01:16:39.740,01:16:41.780
"So BEC is infinitely
compressible.",01:16:41.780,01:16:44.110
"And of course,
this is immediately",01:16:52.880,01:16:54.490
"a manifestation of
the interactions.",01:16:54.490,01:16:56.830
"In the case of the BEC, we
didn't put any interactions",01:17:00.990,01:17:04.880
among the particles.,01:17:04.880,01:17:05.920
"We can put as many of them as
we like into the single state k",01:17:05.920,01:17:09.840
equals to 0.,01:17:09.840,01:17:11.210
"Of course, real heliums,
they have the self-avoiding--",01:17:11.210,01:17:14.370
the interaction between them.,01:17:14.370,01:17:16.464
"They cannot go
[? through ?] each other.",01:17:16.464,01:17:18.130
"So that's an
important difference.",01:17:18.130,01:17:20.760
"Number 2 is that detailed
shapes/ T dependences of heat",01:17:24.830,01:17:41.400
"capacity and density of the
superfluid part are different.",01:17:41.400,01:17:47.970
OK.,01:17:51.260,01:17:53.150
"So I have up there what
the heat capacity of a BEC",01:17:53.150,01:17:58.640
should look like.,01:17:58.640,01:18:01.100
"Now, people have measured
the heat capacity of helium",01:18:01.100,01:18:07.720
"as a function of temperature,
and something does indeed",01:18:07.720,01:18:12.410
happen at Tc.,01:18:12.410,01:18:16.350
"And what you find the shape
is is something like this.",01:18:16.350,01:18:21.310
"It goes to 0, and then it
does something like this.",01:18:25.500,01:18:33.300
"And so while it doesn't look
that different from what",01:18:33.300,01:18:37.780
"I have up there, except that
when you look at the behavior",01:18:37.780,01:18:42.400
"down here, at the
transition, over there",01:18:42.400,01:18:45.770
it went to a finite value.,01:18:45.770,01:18:47.790
Here it diverges as a log.,01:18:47.790,01:18:49.995
"So when you go to Tc, it
actually goes to infinity.",01:18:56.700,01:19:01.460
"And because of the
shape that this has,",01:19:01.460,01:19:03.760
"this is sometimes called
the lambda transition.",01:19:03.760,01:19:06.130
"Now, there's lots of issues
about interesting things",01:19:12.760,01:19:17.560
"happening at the
transition, and we",01:19:17.560,01:19:20.090
won't be able to resolve that.,01:19:20.090,01:19:23.050
"But one thing that we should
be able to figure out,",01:19:23.050,01:19:25.910
"based on what we know
already, is the behavior",01:19:25.910,01:19:29.150
as things go to 0 temperature.,01:19:29.150,01:19:31.900
"And I said that for the
Bose-Einstein condensate,",01:19:31.900,01:19:34.950
"the temperature dependence
is T to the 3/2.",01:19:34.950,01:19:38.680
"What is important is
that for the superfluid,",01:19:38.680,01:19:43.050
"it is actually
proportional to T cubed.",01:19:43.050,01:19:45.750
"And T cubed, if you
go back in the course,",01:19:50.020,01:19:53.930
"is a signature of what
was happening for phonons.",01:19:53.930,01:19:57.890
"So Landau looked
at this and said",01:19:57.890,01:19:59.860
"there must be some kind of a
phonon-like excitation going",01:19:59.860,01:20:03.430
"on, which is different from this
case [INAUDIBLE] excitations",01:20:03.430,01:20:09.085
that we have.,01:20:09.085,01:20:12.710
"The other thing that
we had was that if we",01:20:12.710,01:20:17.000
"look at the fraction that is
in-- let's say the density that",01:20:17.000,01:20:23.560
"is in the k equals to 0 state as
a function of temperature, what",01:20:23.560,01:20:30.910
"happens for the
superfluid-- sorry,",01:20:30.910,01:20:38.850
"what happens for the
Bose-Einstein condensate--",01:20:38.850,01:20:41.370
"for the Bose-Einstein
condensate,",01:20:41.370,01:20:43.110
"let's use the
green-- essentially,",01:20:43.110,01:20:47.250
"the curve will come down to Tc
linearly, and then it goes up,",01:20:47.250,01:20:56.380
"and it reaches its
asymptotic value.",01:20:56.380,01:21:01.580
"From this result, the
fraction that is excited,",01:21:01.580,01:21:06.050
"the difference to 1
is proportional to 1",01:21:06.050,01:21:09.130
over lambda cubed.,01:21:09.130,01:21:10.130
So this goes like T to the 3/2.,01:21:10.130,01:21:12.060
"You can ask whether what was
observed in the Andronikashvili",01:21:16.100,01:21:20.820
"experiment, eventually
this measure",01:21:20.820,01:21:24.870
"also, the fraction that is
in the superfluid component",01:21:24.870,01:21:29.930
"or excited states, does
this curve match that curve?",01:21:29.930,01:21:34.290
"But if I take this curve and
put it over here, first of all,",01:21:34.290,01:21:38.350
down here it is different.,01:21:38.350,01:21:40.770
"It goes like Tc minus T to the
2/3 power rather than linear",01:21:40.770,01:21:45.980
that you have over here.,01:21:45.980,01:21:48.600
"That, again, is less
[? worry ?] than the fact",01:21:48.600,01:21:50.790
"that over here it goes
to 0 proportional to T",01:21:50.790,01:21:54.265
to the fourth.,01:21:54.265,01:21:56.380
"Again, something that
needs explanation.",01:21:56.380,01:21:58.564
"And finally, I will
write down one statement,",01:22:03.410,01:22:07.500
"and then maybe we'll
explain next time,",01:22:07.500,01:22:11.130
"is that BEC with the
spectrum of excitations,",01:22:11.130,01:22:20.800
"which is k squared over
2m, cannot be superfluid.",01:22:20.800,01:22:29.020
"There is an interesting reason
for that that we will explain.",01:22:32.020,01:22:38.592
"And indeed, we'll see
that having excitations",01:22:38.592,01:22:43.190
"that are [INAUDIBLE] like is
compatible with superfluidity.",01:22:43.190,01:22:47.180
This kind of excitation is not.,01:22:47.180,01:22:49.890
"So why is that, et cetera,
we'll talk about next time.",01:22:49.890,01:22:55.100
