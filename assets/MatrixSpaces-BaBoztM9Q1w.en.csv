ANA RITA PIRES: Hi there.,00:00:05.760,00:00:06.820
Welcome to recitation.,00:00:06.820,00:00:08.510
"In lecture, you've been
learning about vector",00:00:08.510,00:00:10.990
"spaces whose vectors are
actually matrices or functions,",00:00:10.990,00:00:15.040
"and this is what our
problem today is about.",00:00:15.040,00:00:17.640
"We have a set of 2 by 3
matrices whose null space",00:00:17.640,00:00:22.020
"contains the vector [2, 1, 1].",00:00:22.020,00:00:24.250
"And I want you to show
that this set is actually",00:00:24.250,00:00:27.610
"a vector subspace of the
space of all 2 by 3 matrices.",00:00:27.610,00:00:32.970
"And then, I want you
to find a basis for it.",00:00:32.970,00:00:36.590
"When you're done, here is
an additional question.",00:00:36.590,00:00:39.150
"What about the set of those 2
by 3 matrices whose column space",00:00:39.150,00:00:44.500
"contains the vector [2, 1]?",00:00:44.500,00:00:47.760
All right.,00:00:47.760,00:00:48.430
"Hit pause and work
on it yourself,",00:00:48.430,00:00:50.670
"and when you're ready, I'll come
back and show you how I did it.",00:00:50.670,00:00:53.824
Hi.,00:01:01.390,00:01:01.890
I hope you managed to solve it.,00:01:01.890,00:01:05.090
Let's do it.,00:01:05.090,00:01:07.070
"So, how do we show that
something is a vector subspace?",00:01:07.070,00:01:11.360
"Well, there are only two
things that we need to check.",00:01:11.360,00:01:13.920
"One is that if two vectors,
in this case two matrices,",00:01:13.920,00:01:18.420
"are in that space, then
their sum is in that space.",00:01:18.420,00:01:21.670
"And if you take a vector,
in this case a matrix,",00:01:21.670,00:01:24.640
"and you multiply by a scalar
you'll still be in the space.",00:01:24.640,00:01:28.440
"So, suppose that the matrices
A and B are in this set",00:01:28.440,00:01:37.230
"that we want to
prove is a subspace.",00:01:37.230,00:01:39.590
"So that means that A
times the vector [2, 1, 1]",00:01:39.590,00:01:46.570
"is equal to the vector [0, 0].",00:01:46.570,00:01:48.710
"Notice that the dimensions
are right: A is 2 by 3,",00:01:48.710,00:01:52.050
so this 3 by 1.,00:01:52.050,00:01:53.260
I should get a 2 by 1.,00:01:53.260,00:01:55.470
"Suppose that [2, 1, 1] is
in the null space of A,",00:01:55.470,00:01:59.170
"and that [2, 1, 1] is also in
the null space of B. Then what",00:01:59.170,00:02:07.310
"is A plus B times [2, 1, 1]?",00:02:07.310,00:02:15.190
"Is [2, 1, 1] in the
null space of A plus B?",00:02:15.190,00:02:18.480
"Well, if you think
about what this means,",00:02:18.480,00:02:20.680
"you're just adding
entry by entry.",00:02:20.680,00:02:23.000
"And you can do it
slowly on your own",00:02:23.000,00:02:27.710
"and just check that
this is what happens.",00:02:27.710,00:02:35.900
"But by now you are familiar
enough with matrices",00:02:35.900,00:02:38.530
"that this should
not be a surprise.",00:02:38.530,00:02:40.810
"Well, this is [0, 0],
and this is [0, 0],",00:02:40.810,00:02:43.110
"so their sum is [0, 0].",00:02:43.110,00:02:46.220
"So, indeed, [2, 1, 1] is in
the null space of A plus B.",00:02:46.220,00:02:50.230
"So if A and B are in the set, A
plus B is in the set, as well.",00:02:50.230,00:02:56.260
Let's check the other thing.,00:02:56.260,00:02:58.040
"The other thing is A times
[2,  1, 1] is [0, 0].",00:02:58.040,00:03:03.340
"So A is in the set,
because [2,  1, 1]",00:03:03.340,00:03:06.050
"is in the null space of A. And
also, let's let c be a scalar.",00:03:06.050,00:03:10.675
"That just means
that c is a number.",00:03:13.550,00:03:16.690
"Then we want to
check that [2, 1,",00:03:16.690,00:03:21.670
"1] is in the null space
of the matrix c*A.",00:03:21.670,00:03:24.840
"That matrix is just the
matrix A except every entry is",00:03:24.840,00:03:27.950
multiplied by the number c.,00:03:27.950,00:03:30.360
"Well, again, this is
how matrices work.",00:03:30.360,00:03:35.790
"You can just pull
out the constant",00:03:35.790,00:03:37.770
"and do A times [2, 1, 1] first.",00:03:37.770,00:03:40.400
"Now this is the vector [0, 0].",00:03:40.400,00:03:43.240
"So, this will simply be c
times [0, 0], which is [0, 0].",00:03:43.240,00:03:48.270
"So the matrix c*A is also
contained in this set.",00:03:48.270,00:03:53.370
"So the set is closed
under addition",00:03:53.370,00:03:55.760
"and under multiplication
by scalar,",00:03:55.760,00:03:58.040
"so the set is, indeed,
a vector subspace.",00:03:58.040,00:04:01.206
"Well that takes care of the
first part of the question.",00:04:01.206,00:04:05.200
"The second part was: find
a basis for the subspace.",00:04:05.200,00:04:08.880
So let's work on that now.,00:04:08.880,00:04:12.710
"So the condition for a
matrix to be in this subspace",00:04:12.710,00:04:16.110
"is that the vector [2, 1, 1]
is in the null space.",00:04:16.110,00:04:20.760
"So I must have A times
[2, 1, 1] is equal to [0, 0].",00:04:20.760,00:04:27.130
So what is happening?,00:04:27.130,00:04:28.210
Well A is a 2 by 3 matrix.,00:04:28.210,00:04:31.650
"So you can actually think
about what happens in each row",00:04:31.650,00:04:34.410
separately.,00:04:34.410,00:04:35.520
"You'll have the first row of A
times [2, 1, 1] is equal to 0.",00:04:35.520,00:04:40.450
"And the second row of A times
[2, 1, 1] is equal to 0.",00:04:40.450,00:04:44.397
So let's see what that means.,00:04:44.397,00:04:45.605
"Each row of the matrix A in this
vector subspace must be [a, b,",00:04:49.230,00:05:01.660
c] [2; 1; 1] equal to 0.,00:05:01.660,00:05:06.410
"This is not really a good
sentence, but you understand.",00:05:06.410,00:05:10.220
"Which means that--
well let's see-- 2a",00:05:10.220,00:05:15.030
plus b plus c is equal to 0.,00:05:15.030,00:05:19.460
"So I can actually write
it in this format.",00:05:19.460,00:05:21.565
"It must be of the
form a, b, and then",00:05:25.320,00:05:34.810
c must be equal to -2a minus b.,00:05:34.810,00:05:42.380
Right?,00:05:42.380,00:05:43.810
"So, furthermore, we
can say that it-- well,",00:05:43.810,00:05:51.000
"one thing that you can do-- let
me write this here to help you.",00:05:51.000,00:05:54.570
"It will be [a, 0, -2a]
plus [0, b, -bl.",00:05:54.570,00:06:02.920
See?,00:06:02.920,00:06:03.420
"So what I'm doing is
I'm splitting this",00:06:03.420,00:06:06.080
"into the linear
combination of two vectors.",00:06:06.080,00:06:09.220
"I can pull out the
a out of this one,",00:06:09.220,00:06:11.750
"and pull the b out
of this one, and it",00:06:11.750,00:06:16.340
"must be a linear
combination-- that's",00:06:16.340,00:06:20.660
"what this means, linear
combination-- of the following:",00:06:20.660,00:06:24.570
"[1, 0, -2] and [0, 1, -1].",00:06:24.570,00:06:31.460
Does that make sense?,00:06:31.460,00:06:33.000
"So this is what each
row of a must satisfy.",00:06:33.000,00:06:36.820
"So we can now put
everything together",00:06:36.820,00:06:39.710
"into what a basis for the
vector space has to be.",00:06:39.710,00:06:43.720
"The basis will be, well
it's 2 by 3 matrix,",00:06:43.720,00:06:50.650
"and each row must be a linear
combination of these two",00:06:50.650,00:06:53.650
vectors.,00:06:53.650,00:06:54.820
"So let's write that-- 1, 0, -2.",00:06:54.820,00:06:59.860
"I'll keep the second row
with zeros-- 0, 1, -1,",00:06:59.860,00:07:04.740
"and I'll keep the
second row of zeros.",00:07:04.740,00:07:06.865
"And now the same, but keeping
the first row with zeros,",00:07:06.865,00:07:12.560
"I'm taking these vectors
on the second row.",00:07:12.560,00:07:19.710
"So this is a basis
for my vector space.",00:07:19.710,00:07:23.640
"One, two, three,
four; that also means",00:07:23.640,00:07:26.220
"that the dimension
of the subspace is 4.",00:07:26.220,00:07:30.560
"There was one further
question, which",00:07:30.560,00:07:32.760
"was what can you say about
the set of those matrices that",00:07:32.760,00:07:38.600
"contain the vector [2, 1]
in their column space?",00:07:38.600,00:07:41.430
"What about the set of those 2
by 3 matrices whose column space",00:07:44.610,00:07:48.180
"contains the vector [2, 1].",00:07:48.180,00:07:50.147
Is that a vector subspace?,00:07:50.147,00:07:51.230
"Well one quick check
that you can always do",00:07:54.600,00:07:58.020
"is check that the zero vector,
in this case the zero matrix,",00:07:58.020,00:08:03.070
belongs to the set.,00:08:03.070,00:08:05.390
"Does the zero 2 by 3
matrix-- [0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0].",00:08:05.390,00:08:13.180
"Does this matrix
belong to this set?",00:08:13.180,00:08:15.800
"Does this matrix contain
the vector [2, 1]",00:08:15.800,00:08:18.840
in its column space?,00:08:18.840,00:08:20.540
"It does not, so this set
cannot be a vector subspace.",00:08:20.540,00:08:25.490
"If you want to think about how
this 0 belonging in the set",00:08:25.490,00:08:29.210
"has anything to do with the
two conditions being closed",00:08:29.210,00:08:32.570
"under sum and closed under
multiplication by scalar,",00:08:32.570,00:08:35.770
"simply think that
you should always",00:08:35.770,00:08:38.179
"be able to multiply a
matrix by the scalar 0",00:08:38.179,00:08:41.590
and have it still be in the set.,00:08:41.590,00:08:44.210
That will be your zero matrix.,00:08:44.210,00:08:46.040
"Well the zero matrix
is not in the set,",00:08:46.040,00:08:49.250
"so the set is not
a vector subspace.",00:08:49.250,00:08:51.722
All right?,00:08:51.722,00:08:52.430
We're done.,00:08:52.430,00:08:53.310
Thank you.,00:08:53.310,00:08:54.881
