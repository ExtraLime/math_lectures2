&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: All right.,00:00:12.410,00:00:12.830
Welcome back.,00:00:12.830,00:00:13.370
"This is CS50, and this is
Week One, Continued.",00:00:13.370,00:00:16.510
"So one of the reasons we've been passing
around technologies like",00:00:16.510,00:00:20.050
"Google Glass is that they come with
something known as an API, an",00:00:20.050,00:00:24.120
Application Programming Interface.,00:00:24.120,00:00:25.980
"And what this means is that with the
right files and with the right",00:00:25.980,00:00:28.830
"documentation, you can actually write
software for even devices like these.",00:00:28.830,00:00:32.850
"&gt;&gt; And so what we have in mind toward
semesters end is, if a project",00:00:32.850,00:00:36.200
"involving, say, Google Glass might
appeal, we'll see what we can do in",00:00:36.200,00:00:39.310
"terms of hooking you up with some
loaner hardware as well as the",00:00:39.310,00:00:42.220
"publicly-accessible API so that you can
actually start creating software",00:00:42.220,00:00:46.500
that runs on that same Google Glass.,00:00:46.500,00:00:48.630
"&gt;&gt; Another device that we've been playing
with of late that we thought might be",00:00:48.630,00:00:51.710
"fun at semester's end is
this little thing here.",00:00:51.710,00:00:53.910
"It's called Leap Motion, and what you're
about to see is technically an",00:00:53.910,00:00:56.860
"advertisement for the device, but it
does speak to what this particular",00:00:56.860,00:01:00.280
device is capable of.,00:01:00.280,00:01:01.240
"And it, too, comes with an API via
which you can write software to",00:01:01.240,00:01:05.550
"control your own computer in a manner
quite like this one-minute film here.",00:01:05.550,00:01:10.545
&gt;&gt; [VIDEO PLAYBACK],00:01:10.545,00:01:12.070
&gt;&gt; [END VIDEO PLAYBACK],00:02:08.002,00:02:08.590
"&gt;&gt; So right now, this device happens to
be implemented as a little USB",00:02:08.590,00:02:11.190
"connector that you can plug into your
computer, but I wouldn't be surprised",00:02:11.190,00:02:14.290
"if before long we have these kinds of
technologies in the next batch of PCs",00:02:14.290,00:02:17.930
"and Macs so that you can, indeed,
interact with it in",00:02:17.930,00:02:20.510
a manner like that.,00:02:20.510,00:02:21.650
"In fact, what I thought I'd do, too, is
I pulled up a little demonstration",00:02:21.650,00:02:24.250
program that comes with this software.,00:02:24.250,00:02:25.860
"So I've put the little sensor
in front of my laptop.",00:02:25.860,00:02:28.700
"&gt;&gt; And as you can see, it already realizes
that my hand is there",00:02:28.700,00:02:32.420
controlling it.,00:02:32.420,00:02:33.400
"And all this application does is
swimmingly little things like this.",00:02:33.400,00:02:37.900
"But you can see that, indeed,
I have five fingers there.",00:02:37.900,00:02:41.080
"If we can get it to do all 10,
you can imagine a neat piano",00:02:41.080,00:02:44.270
application or the like.,00:02:44.270,00:02:45.390
"So if you'd like to come up after class
today and play with that as",00:02:45.390,00:02:47.820
"well, you are welcome to.",00:02:47.820,00:02:49.720
So more on that toward semester's end.,00:02:49.720,00:02:52.930
"&gt;&gt; So a couple of administrative
announcements.",00:02:52.930,00:02:54.420
"One, do section by this Friday
at noon at cs60.net/section.",00:02:54.420,00:02:58.690
"That URL is on the course's
homepage as well.",00:02:58.690,00:03:01.260
"In the meantime, though, supersections
will debut this Sunday.",00:03:01.260,00:03:04.010
"Supersections are a one-time thing,
because it takes us some time to work",00:03:04.010,00:03:07.800
out who's in which section and where.,00:03:07.800,00:03:09.470
"&gt;&gt; So this coming Sunday, there'll be one
section for those less comfortable,",00:03:09.470,00:03:12.280
"one section for those
more comfortable.",00:03:12.280,00:03:14.040
"And those of you somewhere in
between are welcome to go to",00:03:14.040,00:03:16.110
either or both or neither.,00:03:16.110,00:03:17.850
Both of these will be filmed.,00:03:17.850,00:03:19.150
"They'll be in a larger auditorium than
a section normally would be in.",00:03:19.150,00:03:22.740
"But the goal here is to equip you with
some comfort with problem set one,",00:03:22.740,00:03:26.110
"with C, with the CS50 appliance, this
weekend, even before you find out your",00:03:26.110,00:03:29.910
formal section assignment.,00:03:29.910,00:03:31.050
"So you'll meet your TF and your smaller
group of sectionmates in about",00:03:31.050,00:03:34.700
a week's time.,00:03:34.700,00:03:36.350
"&gt;&gt; Office hours, meanwhile,
have been going on.",00:03:36.350,00:03:38.200
"Do take advantage of them tonight or
tomorrow night if you would like.",00:03:38.200,00:03:41.020
Problem set 0 is due on Friday.,00:03:41.020,00:03:43.460
"This is a day later than the
regularly-scheduled Thursday.",00:03:43.460,00:03:46.680
"But with problem set 1, you'll see
that it includes some warm-up",00:03:46.680,00:03:50.410
"exercises with which you yourself
can extend your",00:03:50.410,00:03:52.770
Thursday deadline to Friday.,00:03:52.770,00:03:54.660
"Problem set 1, meanwhile, will debut
on the course's website this coming",00:03:54.660,00:03:58.410
"Friday, if you'd like to curl up with
it as I did once upon a time late",00:03:58.410,00:04:02.000
Friday night in your room.,00:04:02.000,00:04:04.370
"&gt;&gt; So cs50.net/appliance is the place where
you can get the CS50 appliance",00:04:04.370,00:04:07.660
that we started using on Monday.,00:04:07.660,00:04:09.040
We'll use it a bit more today.,00:04:09.040,00:04:10.140
"But rest assured that the problem set 1
specification will walk you through",00:04:10.140,00:04:14.040
"precisely the steps you need
to get that up and running.",00:04:14.040,00:04:16.490
"So don't worry about doing that before
Pset 1 if you'd rather not.",00:04:16.490,00:04:22.120
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:04:22.120,00:04:22.660
"So we looked on Monday at source code,
but in the context of a new",00:04:22.660,00:04:27.180
"programming language, namely C. And C,
unlike Scratch, is not graphical.",00:04:27.180,00:04:30.895
It's not puzzle pieces.,00:04:30.895,00:04:32.270
It's more English-like syntax.,00:04:32.270,00:04:34.450
"And there's a couple of steps involved
in actually writing and running a",00:04:34.450,00:04:37.140
"program in C, because besides source
code like this, you need something",00:04:37.140,00:04:41.650
called a compiler.,00:04:41.650,00:04:42.890
"And in layman's terms, what
does a compiler do for us?",00:04:42.890,00:04:46.682
Yeah.,00:04:46.682,00:04:47.650
"&gt;&gt; STUDENT: It converts the code
that you write to 0s and 1s.",00:04:47.650,00:04:51.040
&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: Good.,00:04:51.040,00:04:51.151
"So it converts the code that
we write to 0s and 1s.",00:04:51.151,00:04:53.580
"It converts so-called source code to
object code, the latter of which looks",00:04:53.580,00:04:57.730
a little something like this.,00:04:57.730,00:04:59.140
"And it's your CPU, the brains inside of
your computer, that because of the",00:04:59.140,00:05:02.860
"people who created those computers,
know what those sequences",00:05:02.860,00:05:06.280
of 0s and 1s mean.,00:05:06.280,00:05:07.460
&gt;&gt; Maybe it means print.,00:05:07.460,00:05:08.640
Maybe it means addition.,00:05:08.640,00:05:10.265
Maybe it means subtraction.,00:05:10.265,00:05:11.610
Maybe it means display a graphic.,00:05:11.610,00:05:13.350
"There are predefined patterns of bits
that the world has decided mean",00:05:13.350,00:05:16.870
certain things.,00:05:16.870,00:05:17.700
"But for the most part in this course,
we'll work at a higher level, and",00:05:17.700,00:05:20.760
"we'll take for granted that there exist
things like compilers that can",00:05:20.760,00:05:24.180
"make our source code function
in the way we intend.",00:05:24.180,00:05:27.670
"&gt;&gt; So the program we wrote first last week
and then began to port, so to",00:05:27.670,00:05:31.660
"speak, to C this past
Monday, was this.",00:05:31.660,00:05:33.920
"When green flag clicked, say hello.",00:05:33.920,00:05:35.700
"This was, of course,
written in Scratch.",00:05:35.700,00:05:37.430
"And I claimed that the equivalent
program in C looked a little",00:05:37.430,00:05:40.710
something like this.,00:05:40.710,00:05:41.520
"&gt;&gt; So what I thought we'd do at first is,
let's tease apart what looks, at first",00:05:41.520,00:05:45.050
"glance, admittedly, as fairly arcane
syntax, but you'll start to notice",00:05:45.050,00:05:48.790
patterns quite quickly.,00:05:48.790,00:05:50.160
"What we'll also do today is provide
you with a mental model for some",00:05:50.160,00:05:53.770
"canonical, some standard constructs
in programming.",00:05:53.770,00:05:57.280
"And then we'll actually get our hands
dirty with some examples as well.",00:05:57.280,00:06:00.420
"&gt;&gt; So for those of you more comfortable,
realize that this week and then next",00:06:00.420,00:06:04.140
week may very well be a bit of review.,00:06:04.140,00:06:05.940
"But especially when the hacker edition
of problem set 1 goes out on the",00:06:05.940,00:06:08.810
"course's website on Friday, I do think
you'll find that even as you fill in",00:06:08.810,00:06:12.330
"some blanks over the next week or two,
you'll begin to get ever more",00:06:12.330,00:06:15.390
"challenged and encounter
new and newer things.",00:06:15.390,00:06:18.410
"&gt;&gt; So let's tease this program apart
a few lines at a time.",00:06:18.410,00:06:21.310
"At the very top, we have what's
technically called a",00:06:21.310,00:06:24.140
preprocessor directive.,00:06:24.140,00:06:25.950
"This is just a line of code that says
to include the contents of a file,",00:06:25.950,00:06:30.510
"called standard I/N, standard input--
or, sorry, standard I/O, standard",00:06:30.510,00:06:35.080
"input/output, .h, inside
of my own program.",00:06:35.080,00:06:38.670
"&gt;&gt; So in other words, if I wrote this
program with a simple text editor like",00:06:38.670,00:06:41.670
"gedit, the simpler equivalent of
something like Microsoft Word, that",00:06:41.670,00:06:45.260
"instruction, #include stdio.h, is just
going to tell the compiler, grab the",00:06:45.260,00:06:50.970
"contents of that other file, stdio.h,
and paste them right here.",00:06:50.970,00:06:56.080
"&gt;&gt; Now, why do I care?",00:06:56.080,00:06:57.090
"What did we claim is inside of this file
called stdio.h, which is stored",00:06:57.090,00:07:01.850
"somewhere on my hard drive, or in this
case, somewhere in the CS50 appliance?",00:07:01.850,00:07:05.490
Someone else put it there for me.,00:07:05.490,00:07:06.635
But what's in it?,00:07:06.635,00:07:09.910
"&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's a declaration of
a function called printf.",00:07:09.910,00:07:13.020
"So printf recalls the function that
displays words and characters and",00:07:13.020,00:07:17.400
numbers on the screen at my bidding.,00:07:17.400,00:07:20.160
But I didn't write it.,00:07:20.160,00:07:21.220
CS50 didn't write it.,00:07:21.220,00:07:22.230
"Someone years ago wrote it, and they
essentially gave us the recipe for it",00:07:22.230,00:07:26.990
in a file called stdio.h.,00:07:26.990,00:07:29.110
"So that first line just gives me access
to functions that someone else",00:07:29.110,00:07:33.240
"wrote years ago, among
which are printf.",00:07:33.240,00:07:36.500
"&gt;&gt; Now, the next line I'm going to wave my
hand at, at least until next week.",00:07:36.500,00:07:39.450
"But for now, know that int main(void) is
essentially the equivalent of this",00:07:39.450,00:07:43.620
"yellow puzzle piece when
green flag clicked.",00:07:43.620,00:07:46.310
"The world, years ago, decided that if
you're writing a program in the",00:07:46.310,00:07:49.510
"language called C, you start
your program with a line",00:07:49.510,00:07:53.150
that looks like that.,00:07:53.150,00:07:54.410
"In just about a week's time, it'll make
sense what int is, what void is.",00:07:54.410,00:07:57.650
"But for now, just think of it
as this yellow puzzle piece.",00:07:57.650,00:08:00.840
"&gt;&gt; Now next, we have a curly brace followed
by another close curly brace,",00:08:00.840,00:08:04.550
so to speak.,00:08:04.550,00:08:05.240
"And we'll see these throughout
programs in C, as well as",00:08:05.240,00:08:07.430
JavaScript and PHP.,00:08:07.430,00:08:08.930
"And these just encapsulate
related lines of code.",00:08:08.930,00:08:11.345
"The open curly brace essentially
says, here comes some code.",00:08:11.345,00:08:14.600
"And the closed curly brace, which is
angled in the other direction, just",00:08:14.600,00:08:17.590
"means, that's it for
the relevant code.",00:08:17.590,00:08:19.920
"&gt;&gt; So the juicy line in this first
program is the last, printf,",00:08:19.920,00:08:22.970
"quote-unquote, hello world.",00:08:22.970,00:08:25.080
"And I called the thing between
quotes what last time?",00:08:25.080,00:08:30.670
So it's a string.,00:08:30.670,00:08:31.285
"And a string is just the techie
term for a sequence of",00:08:31.285,00:08:35.309
"characters, a word, a phrase.",00:08:35.309,00:08:37.169
"Even a single letter could
be double quoted.",00:08:37.169,00:08:39.380
"But it's a sequence of zero
or more characters.",00:08:39.380,00:08:41.840
"&gt;&gt; Backslash-n, though, looks
a bit strange.",00:08:41.840,00:08:43.650
"But it simply meant something
simple to the computer.",00:08:43.650,00:08:46.290
What's backslash-n?,00:08:46.290,00:08:48.060
New line.,00:08:48.060,00:08:48.570
"So that's just the special sequence of
characters that the world has decided",00:08:48.570,00:08:52.490
"means put a line break right there,
because the compiler will actually get",00:08:52.490,00:08:56.880
"confused, usually, if you, very
understandably, but incorrectly, just",00:08:56.880,00:09:02.280
"start hitting Enter to put
new lines in your code.",00:09:02.280,00:09:04.570
"You need to be a little more
explicit with backslash-n.",00:09:04.570,00:09:07.150
"&gt;&gt; And we'll see there's a few other such
patterns for special characters.",00:09:07.150,00:09:10.540
"For instance, if you wanted to let your
mind wander to a corner case,",00:09:10.540,00:09:14.340
"suppose that I wanted to print a
double quote on the screen for",00:09:14.340,00:09:18.080
"whatever reason, that would seem to
be a little problematic, right?",00:09:18.080,00:09:21.840
"Because if I put a double quote in the
middle of ""hello, world,"" for whatever",00:09:21.840,00:09:24.990
"reason, why does that seem
potentially problematic?",00:09:24.990,00:09:30.120
It breaks the string.,00:09:30.120,00:09:32.180
&gt;&gt; The compiler is just a program.,00:09:32.180,00:09:34.700
"A program like a compiler is just going
to read your code top to bottom,",00:09:34.700,00:09:37.210
left to right.,00:09:37.210,00:09:37.990
"And if sees three double quotes instead
of two, it's not going to know",00:09:37.990,00:09:41.850
"if you mean that the thing to the left
should be the string, or the thing to",00:09:41.850,00:09:45.210
"the right, or the whole thing.",00:09:45.210,00:09:46.570
"It's ambiguous, and so what a typical
compiler would do is just freak out,",00:09:46.570,00:09:50.560
"and give you some error message, and
make you deal with the problem.",00:09:50.560,00:09:53.710
"&gt;&gt; So given that backslash-n means a new
line, what would your instincts now",00:09:53.710,00:09:58.120
"start to be if you wanted to include
something anomalous like a double",00:09:58.120,00:10:02.610
"quote inside of this otherwise-quoted
string?",00:10:02.610,00:10:06.210
Backslash-double quote.,00:10:06.210,00:10:07.640
"And so we'll see this
kind of pattern too.",00:10:07.640,00:10:09.630
"&gt;&gt; If you want to do something a little
strange, you'll find that the",00:10:09.630,00:10:12.490
"solutions often follow a pattern,
and the backslash",00:10:12.490,00:10:15.060
denotes an escape sequence.,00:10:15.060,00:10:17.150
"And it just means something special
that we need to represent in a",00:10:17.150,00:10:20.320
different way.,00:10:20.320,00:10:21.060
"As for how do you represent
a backslash, well, we'll",00:10:21.060,00:10:23.830
come back to that.,00:10:23.830,00:10:24.550
"But the answer, too, is actually
a bit obvious.",00:10:24.550,00:10:26.930
"&gt;&gt; So let's now introduce some other
programming constructs",00:10:26.930,00:10:31.080
that you saw in Scratch.,00:10:31.080,00:10:31.915
"You've probably taken for granted
already if you've already dived into",00:10:31.915,00:10:34.790
problem set 0.,00:10:34.790,00:10:36.060
"But let's now introduce the syntax in C
for these otherwise fairly intuitive",00:10:36.060,00:10:40.950
"ideas, at least some of them.",00:10:40.950,00:10:42.300
"&gt;&gt; So this notion of a condition or
a branch, whereas previously we",00:10:42.300,00:10:45.570
"represented it with code that looked
like this on the left in Scratch--",00:10:45.570,00:10:49.330
"if x is less than y, then say so--",00:10:49.330,00:10:52.200
"instead now in C-- let me hone
in on the simplest case--",00:10:52.200,00:10:56.760
"we're simply going to say, if, open
parenthesis, something is true-- a",00:10:56.760,00:11:01.235
"Boolean expression is going to go
where I have said condition--",00:11:01.235,00:11:04.190
"close parenthesis, then do what's
inside of those curly braces.",00:11:04.190,00:11:08.170
"&gt;&gt; So here, too, the curly braces
are kind of like Scratch's",00:11:08.170,00:11:11.020
U-shaped puzzle pieces.,00:11:11.020,00:11:12.460
Do what's inside these curly braces.,00:11:12.460,00:11:14.890
"In this case, slash slash.",00:11:14.890,00:11:16.790
"And notice this is a forward
slash, not a backslash.",00:11:16.790,00:11:19.720
"Forward slash, forward slash,
for those who've programmed",00:11:19.720,00:11:21.440
"before, just means--",00:11:21.440,00:11:23.370
it's just a comment.,00:11:23.370,00:11:24.190
"A comment is not a line
of code, per se.",00:11:24.190,00:11:26.630
"It's a line of English that you, the
human, have written to yourself to",00:11:26.630,00:11:30.200
"perhaps remind you to do something, to
explain to yourself, to explain to",00:11:30.200,00:11:33.540
"someone else, what your code is doing.",00:11:33.540,00:11:35.260
It's just a descriptive comment.,00:11:35.260,00:11:37.050
"&gt;&gt; Now, of course, we can have a two-way
fork in the road just by doing this, a",00:11:37.050,00:11:40.880
"three-way fork in the road by doing
this, and if you continue this",00:11:40.880,00:11:43.930
"pattern, you can have four-way,
five-way, six-way forks in the road if",00:11:43.930,00:11:47.570
"you need to handle, indeed,
that many conditions.",00:11:47.570,00:11:50.150
And then notice the parallelism here--,00:11:50.150,00:11:52.010
"if (condition), else if (condition),
and the only one that's a little",00:11:52.010,00:11:55.070
"strange is the last, which
is just that else.",00:11:55.070,00:11:58.010
"But again, this is identical,
conceptually, to what we've done",00:11:58.010,00:12:01.170
"already, even though the syntax will
take a little bit getting used to.",00:12:01.170,00:12:04.690
"&gt;&gt; Now, in this example, there are
some other strange syntax.",00:12:04.690,00:12:07.730
"We see printf again, open parenthesis,
and close parenthesis.",00:12:07.730,00:12:11.220
"And inside of there is
a quoted string.",00:12:11.220,00:12:13.190
"The parentheses, in the context
of printf, go on the left",00:12:13.190,00:12:17.060
and right of what?,00:12:17.060,00:12:18.160
"What do we describe that quoted
string as more generally?",00:12:18.160,00:12:22.190
&gt;&gt; So it's an argument.,00:12:22.190,00:12:23.320
"Any time you have a function, like
printf, and then an open paren and a",00:12:23.320,00:12:26.620
"close paren and something inside of
it, whether it's a string, or an",00:12:26.620,00:12:30.330
"integer, or anything else, the thing in
between those parentheses is called",00:12:30.330,00:12:34.420
an argument.,00:12:34.420,00:12:35.110
"&gt;&gt; And an argument just influences
the function's behavior.",00:12:35.110,00:12:37.910
"In this case, it's pretty clear how.",00:12:37.910,00:12:39.990
"x &lt; y is what's being passed in,
so to speak, as an argument.",00:12:39.990,00:12:44.480
"And printf is going to
print exactly that.",00:12:44.480,00:12:47.720
"Because surely, the person years ago
who implemented printf had no idea",00:12:47.720,00:12:51.590
"what we human successors were
going to use printf for.",00:12:51.590,00:12:55.000
"So that's why arguments exist, to
influence behavior after a function's",00:12:55.000,00:12:58.610
been written.,00:12:58.610,00:12:59.450
"&gt;&gt; Now, Boolean expression.",00:12:59.450,00:13:00.780
We've seen these before in Scratch.,00:13:00.780,00:13:02.470
"It turns out in C you can also ""or""
them together, so to speak.",00:13:02.470,00:13:06.680
"Two vertical bars means that this block
of code, this do this, will",00:13:06.680,00:13:10.930
"execute if the first condition is true
or the second condition is true.",00:13:10.930,00:13:15.350
"And even though you might not have done
this in Scratch, you could indeed",00:13:15.350,00:13:17.710
"do this in Scratch, And you can also
express yourself differently--",00:13:17.710,00:13:20.580
"if the first condition and the second
condition are true, then do what's",00:13:20.580,00:13:25.300
inside of the curly braces.,00:13:25.300,00:13:27.160
"&gt;&gt; And just as an aside, the reason it's
a double ampersand and a double",00:13:27.160,00:13:31.210
"vertical bar, we'll see eventually
that a single vertical bar and a",00:13:31.210,00:13:34.610
"single ampersand actually have different
meaning in C. So for now,",00:13:34.610,00:13:38.710
"that duplication of symbols
is intentional.",00:13:38.710,00:13:41.840
"&gt;&gt; So let's introduce, briefly,
this other bit of syntax.",00:13:41.840,00:13:45.070
"This doesn't quite carry over to
Scratch, but I claim that I can",00:13:45.070,00:13:48.940
"implement the notion of an if else, if
else, if else, if else statement using",00:13:48.940,00:13:55.190
something called a switch statement.,00:13:55.190,00:13:56.760
"And the only reason this really exists
is to just give you, the programmer, a",00:13:56.760,00:14:00.820
"slightly different way of solving some
problem, even though logically it",00:14:00.820,00:14:05.470
doesn't give you any new capabilities.,00:14:05.470,00:14:07.340
&gt;&gt; By that I mean this.,00:14:07.340,00:14:08.530
"When you say switch, and then a space,
and then a pair of parentheses, inside",00:14:08.530,00:14:13.330
of which goes an expression--,00:14:13.330,00:14:14.570
"and this might be a little non-obvious
at first, but this is not an argument,",00:14:14.570,00:14:18.010
"technically, because switch
is not a function.",00:14:18.010,00:14:20.680
"So for now, just assume that we're using
parentheses in different places",00:14:20.680,00:14:24.230
for different reasons.,00:14:24.230,00:14:25.250
"&gt;&gt; So switch on expression means I can
put a variable inside of those",00:14:25.250,00:14:29.310
parentheses where it says expression.,00:14:29.310,00:14:31.350
And then if that variable--,00:14:31.350,00:14:33.090
"suppose it's called x, and
it's just an integer--",00:14:33.090,00:14:35.400
"I can then enumerate in my slide
here something like this.",00:14:35.400,00:14:38.900
"If x is my variable, and I
want to do something if x",00:14:38.900,00:14:41.690
"equals 1, I can do that.",00:14:41.690,00:14:43.480
"&gt;&gt; If I instead want to do something
if x is 2, I can do that.",00:14:43.480,00:14:46.660
"Else, if I want to do something else
entirely, I can have a default case in",00:14:46.660,00:14:50.390
which case I do this other thing.,00:14:50.390,00:14:52.750
"So in that sense, it's equivalent to an
if x equals equals 1, else if else,",00:14:52.750,00:14:58.730
"but I mention this now just because
we'll see it again.",00:14:58.730,00:15:01.150
"But for now, just know that it exists.",00:15:01.150,00:15:03.720
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:15:03.720,00:15:04.220
"So these last couple are a little more
complex at first glance, but they do",00:15:04.220,00:15:07.660
something fairly straightforward.,00:15:07.660,00:15:09.385
"A for loop in C is a chunk of code that
just does something again and",00:15:09.385,00:15:14.410
again and again.,00:15:14.410,00:15:15.330
"And the only annoying thing about it is
that is that it's a little cryptic",00:15:15.330,00:15:17.590
"to express yourself in this cyclical
pattern, but the world standardized on",00:15:17.590,00:15:21.380
the following way.,00:15:21.380,00:15:22.450
"&gt;&gt; When you use a for loop, you've got
a pair of parentheses again.",00:15:22.450,00:15:25.760
"And notice the two semicolons
in there.",00:15:25.760,00:15:27.570
"Those two semicolons separate three
different expressions inside of the",00:15:27.570,00:15:34.380
parentheses.,00:15:34.380,00:15:35.020
One is the so-called initializations.,00:15:35.020,00:15:37.170
One is the so-called condition.,00:15:37.170,00:15:38.830
And one is the so-called updates.,00:15:38.830,00:15:40.210
"&gt;&gt; Looked at in the abstract, this is
completely non-obvious, so let's look",00:15:40.210,00:15:43.240
at a concrete example.,00:15:43.240,00:15:44.630
In Scratch we had a repeat block.,00:15:44.630,00:15:46.720
"And this block said repeat 10 times, say
""hello, world."" Let me claim for",00:15:46.720,00:15:50.670
"now, and we'll come back to this, and
this, too, will get more familiar to",00:15:50.670,00:15:53.810
"you before long, the equivalent C
code could be said to be this--",00:15:53.810,00:15:57.345
"a for statement and a space, a pair of
parentheses, notice the semicolons in",00:15:57.345,00:16:02.320
"there, which separate three distinct
things, the initialization, the",00:16:02.320,00:16:05.730
"condition, and the update.",00:16:05.730,00:16:07.320
"&gt;&gt; And take a guess what
the first is doing.",00:16:07.320,00:16:08.840
Int i = 0.,00:16:08.840,00:16:10.690
"In rough layman's terms, what is
that doing for us, probably?",00:16:10.690,00:16:15.120
So yeah.,00:16:15.120,00:16:15.590
"It's declaring a variable called i,
and it's giving it what value?",00:16:15.590,00:16:19.630
0.,00:16:19.630,00:16:20.220
"So it's creating a variable called
i, storing the value 0 in it.",00:16:20.220,00:16:24.280
That's the so-called initialization.,00:16:24.280,00:16:26.420
"&gt;&gt; All right, now I claimed before
that the middle thing, i",00:16:26.420,00:16:29.360
"&lt; 10, is the condition.",00:16:29.360,00:16:31.760
So what is doing?,00:16:31.760,00:16:32.730
"Well, what the for loop does when a
program with a for loop is run, is",00:16:32.730,00:16:36.560
"every time the computer runs through
this loop, top to bottom, top to",00:16:36.560,00:16:41.050
"bottom, just like you guys did when
counting yourselves and sitting down,",00:16:41.050,00:16:43.740
"again and again and again,
the computer is going",00:16:43.740,00:16:47.090
to check that condition.,00:16:47.090,00:16:48.560
"And if i is less than 10,
it'll do it again.",00:16:48.560,00:16:51.140
"If i is less than 10,
it'll do it again.",00:16:51.140,00:16:53.100
"If i is less than ten,
it'll do it again.",00:16:53.100,00:16:55.030
"So that seems to suggest that
hopefully i is changing.",00:16:55.030,00:16:57.330
"Otherwise, we'd have an infinite loop.",00:16:57.330,00:16:59.010
"And indeed, i is changing, because the
last thing after the semicolon there",00:16:59.010,00:17:02.590
is the somewhat cryptic syntax of i++.,00:17:02.590,00:17:05.569
"But those of you who've done this
before, that just means",00:17:05.569,00:17:07.630
quite simply what?,00:17:07.630,00:17:08.609
&gt;&gt; STUDENTS: [INTERPOSING VOICES].,00:17:08.609,00:17:09.730
&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: Add 1 to i.,00:17:09.730,00:17:10.740
Increment i.,00:17:10.740,00:17:11.819
"So we saw a Scratch puzzle
piece for that, actually.",00:17:11.819,00:17:13.910
"It didn't look like i++, but that just
means, quite simply, increment the",00:17:13.910,00:17:18.230
value i by 1 every time you do this.,00:17:18.230,00:17:24.040
"So literally, you start by
initializing i to 0.",00:17:24.040,00:17:26.910
You then check your condition.,00:17:26.910,00:17:29.520
Is 0 less than 10?,00:17:29.520,00:17:31.070
Yes.,00:17:31.070,00:17:31.730
We go through the loop.,00:17:31.730,00:17:32.910
"&gt;&gt; The next thing I claim the computer's
going to do is it's going",00:17:32.910,00:17:35.150
to increment i.,00:17:35.150,00:17:35.910
So i is now 1.,00:17:35.910,00:17:37.080
It checks the condition.,00:17:37.080,00:17:37.940
Is 1 less than 10?,00:17:37.940,00:17:39.290
Of course.,00:17:39.290,00:17:39.930
So does it again.,00:17:39.930,00:17:41.030
Then it increments i++ to 2.,00:17:41.030,00:17:43.580
Is 2 less than 10?,00:17:43.580,00:17:44.610
Yes.,00:17:44.610,00:17:45.230
And again and again and again.,00:17:45.230,00:17:46.670
"And eventually, because of the
plus-plussing, we get to i equals 10.",00:17:46.670,00:17:50.070
Is 10 less than 10?,00:17:50.070,00:17:51.675
"Well, obviously not.",00:17:51.675,00:17:52.990
"And that's the point at which
the for loop just stops.",00:17:52.990,00:17:55.320
"And if you have more code on the
screen down below, the computer",00:17:55.320,00:17:58.320
proceeds to run that code instead.,00:17:58.320,00:18:01.620
"&gt;&gt; So again, even though this is going to
look and feel a little strange at",00:18:01.620,00:18:05.380
"first, certainly for those of you who
have never programmed before, it",00:18:05.380,00:18:07.830
"literally reduces conceptually
to what's otherwise a very",00:18:07.830,00:18:11.640
"straightforward puzzle
piece in Scratch.",00:18:11.640,00:18:14.330
"&gt;&gt; All right, I promised that there'd
be other analogs in Scratch.",00:18:14.330,00:18:19.130
There's this one too.,00:18:19.130,00:18:20.060
And we saw this briefly last time.,00:18:20.060,00:18:21.700
"But remember the forever
block in Scratch?",00:18:21.700,00:18:23.530
It just does something forever?,00:18:23.530,00:18:25.490
"I claimed that you could implement
this in this way.",00:18:25.490,00:18:27.470
"And you can actually implement this
in a bunch of different ways.",00:18:27.470,00:18:29.740
"&gt;&gt; But the while loop is just a different
way in C of expressing yourself.",00:18:29.740,00:18:34.260
"At the end of the day, you can't do
anything with a while loop that you",00:18:34.260,00:18:37.080
can't with a for loop.,00:18:37.080,00:18:38.360
"So they're at the end of the
day functionally the same.",00:18:38.360,00:18:41.430
"But it allows you to express yourself
a little differently in",00:18:41.430,00:18:43.840
the following way.,00:18:43.840,00:18:44.850
"&gt;&gt; With the while loop, it's what's in
parentheses that's checked again and",00:18:44.850,00:18:49.720
again and again.,00:18:49.720,00:18:51.050
"And as soon as that expression is false,
then the loop stops executing,",00:18:51.050,00:18:55.100
"and the computer proceeds to
run whatever other code you",00:18:55.100,00:18:57.890
have in your file.,00:18:57.890,00:18:59.230
"&gt;&gt; But what's interesting here is
that I literally typed true.",00:18:59.230,00:19:02.180
"And true is a type of Boolean value,
a true or false value.",00:19:02.180,00:19:06.680
"So could true ever become
false if I've literally",00:19:06.680,00:19:09.750
hard-coded it into my program?,00:19:09.750,00:19:11.970
So no.,00:19:11.970,00:19:12.470
It's a little strange that I did this.,00:19:12.470,00:19:13.730
But true is true.,00:19:13.730,00:19:15.190
There's no plus-plussing.,00:19:15.190,00:19:16.320
There's no use of variables in here.,00:19:16.320,00:19:17.820
"So because I hard-coded while true, this
loop is always going to evaluate",00:19:17.820,00:19:22.740
again and again and again.,00:19:22.740,00:19:24.090
"&gt;&gt; So how many times is hello world
going to print on the screen?",00:19:24.090,00:19:27.660
Forever.,00:19:27.660,00:19:28.170
"An infinite number of times until the
battery dies or some other external",00:19:28.170,00:19:31.980
event happens.,00:19:31.980,00:19:32.730
"So this is probably not the best program
to write, because if the user",00:19:32.730,00:19:35.880
"can never quit your program, it's
probably not what you intended.",00:19:35.880,00:19:38.660
"&gt;&gt; But sometimes, programs should
have an infinite loop.",00:19:38.660,00:19:41.070
"For instance, if your computer has a
clock on it, it certainly would be",00:19:41.070,00:19:44.050
"nice if your clock it does keep updating
itself forever, albeit once a",00:19:44.050,00:19:48.130
"second or once a minute or
something like that.",00:19:48.130,00:19:50.500
"So even infinite loops
do have their place.",00:19:50.500,00:19:53.690
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:19:53.690,00:19:54.360
"Lastly, this one.",00:19:54.360,00:19:55.190
"And this one is a little bit different
functionally, and we'll come back to",00:19:55.190,00:19:57.770
this probably in Pset 1.,00:19:57.770,00:19:59.460
"But there's another type of loop
called a do while loop.",00:19:59.460,00:20:02.370
"And the only difference here between a
do while loop and, say, a while loop,",00:20:02.370,00:20:07.100
"is that the condition is checked not
before you execute the code, but after",00:20:07.100,00:20:11.120
you execute the code.,00:20:11.120,00:20:12.080
"So at the top for the while
loop, whereas the do while",00:20:12.080,00:20:15.380
checks it at the bottom.,00:20:15.380,00:20:16.560
"&gt;&gt; And this just means that the while loop
will typically execute more times",00:20:16.560,00:20:21.370
or fewer times than a while loop?,00:20:21.370,00:20:24.630
"Potentially more times, because a do
while loop is clearly saying do this,",00:20:24.630,00:20:30.810
"only after which point you check
if the condition inside of the",00:20:30.810,00:20:34.600
parentheses is true.,00:20:34.600,00:20:35.980
"&gt;&gt; So we'll see this again
probably in Pset 1.",00:20:35.980,00:20:37.940
"If you ever want to do something at
least once and then maybe some more",00:20:37.940,00:20:41.150
"times, this is a good
construct to use.",00:20:41.150,00:20:43.350
"But a while loop, by contrast, will
check its condition first.",00:20:43.350,00:20:46.970
"And that's it for loops in C, do
while, while, and for loops.",00:20:46.970,00:20:50.660
"And again, they map pretty nicely back
to Scratch, except this one doesn't",00:20:50.660,00:20:54.700
quite have the same analog in Scratch.,00:20:54.700,00:20:57.350
"&gt;&gt; Well, how about, now, variables?",00:20:57.350,00:20:58.880
"So this is how I declared a variable
syntactically the other day.",00:20:58.880,00:21:02.600
"I had an int, which I claimed
is an integer.",00:21:02.600,00:21:06.440
"I then had a variable called counter,
and then a semicolon.",00:21:06.440,00:21:09.690
So what is this line of code doing?,00:21:09.690,00:21:11.070
"This is, quite simply, declaring
a variable--",00:21:11.070,00:21:14.540
"that is, asking the computer, give me
some memory, give me some bits-- in",00:21:14.540,00:21:17.940
which I can store what?,00:21:17.940,00:21:19.450
An int.,00:21:19.450,00:21:20.300
"And the semicolon just means
end of line of code.",00:21:20.300,00:21:23.570
"&gt;&gt; Now, the second line is probably
pretty guessable.",00:21:23.570,00:21:25.500
What is counter = 0; doing?,00:21:25.500,00:21:29.710
It's assigning 0 to counter.,00:21:29.710,00:21:31.690
"And so this is the other thing
that's a little annoying",00:21:31.690,00:21:33.470
"versus, say, algebra.",00:21:33.470,00:21:34.540
"Whereas in algebra, the equal sign means
equals, here in C, the equal",00:21:34.540,00:21:39.110
sign means assignment.,00:21:39.110,00:21:40.470
"So it means put what's on the right
into what's on the left.",00:21:40.470,00:21:45.380
"And we'll see another symbol, equals
equals, when we want to actually test",00:21:45.380,00:21:49.030
"for quality, somewhat annoyingly.",00:21:49.030,00:21:50.570
&gt;&gt; But this is a little inefficient.,00:21:50.570,00:21:52.590
"It's kind of annoying that I have
to declare a variable and",00:21:52.590,00:21:55.090
then give it a value.,00:21:55.090,00:21:56.110
"So C actually lets us simplify this
and just do it all at once.",00:21:56.110,00:21:59.380
"You can declare the variable
on the left.",00:21:59.380,00:22:01.330
"You can still do the assignment on the
right by putting that equal sign in",00:22:01.330,00:22:04.590
the middle.,00:22:04.590,00:22:05.030
"So at the end of the day, these two are
equivalent, but this one, frankly,",00:22:05.030,00:22:08.740
"is probably the better habit to get into
just because it's a little less",00:22:08.740,00:22:11.840
"code, it's a little easier to read,
and it just tightens up",00:22:11.840,00:22:15.040
"your code, so to speak.",00:22:15.040,00:22:17.470
"&gt;&gt; Any questions thus far on the loops,
on variables, on conditions, on",00:22:17.470,00:22:22.120
"Booleans, either technically
or conceptually?",00:22:22.120,00:22:27.001
All right.,00:22:27.001,00:22:28.010
"So now this next one gets a
little more interesting.",00:22:28.010,00:22:30.690
"And this is the example I put up last
time that just maps a Scratch example",00:22:30.690,00:22:34.790
over to C.,00:22:34.790,00:22:35.820
&gt;&gt; So a function.,00:22:35.820,00:22:36.580
"In layman's terms, what's a function?",00:22:36.580,00:22:38.110
Got to be bolder with your answer.,00:22:42.900,00:22:44.350
What's a function?,00:22:44.350,00:22:45.020
&gt;&gt; STUDENT: Does something.,00:22:45.020,00:22:46.320
&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: What's that?,00:22:46.320,00:22:46.780
&gt;&gt; STUDENT: Does something.,00:22:46.780,00:22:48.000
&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: Does something.,00:22:48.000,00:22:48.710
OK.,00:22:48.710,00:22:49.000
We'll start there.,00:22:49.000,00:22:49.590
So a function does something.,00:22:49.590,00:22:51.270
"So it's a piece of code that's
essentially implemented elsewhere that",00:22:51.270,00:22:55.160
indeed does something.,00:22:55.160,00:22:56.620
"Now, what's interesting about a function
is that it can take input,",00:22:56.620,00:23:00.180
and it can produce output.,00:23:00.180,00:23:02.710
"And let's actually take
a look at this.",00:23:02.710,00:23:05.090
"&gt;&gt; So the man behind the curtain
was deliberate a moment ago.",00:23:05.090,00:23:09.030
Here we have a table.,00:23:09.030,00:23:10.320
"But suppose that this actually
represents a big box.",00:23:10.320,00:23:13.010
So this is a so-called black box.,00:23:13.010,00:23:14.940
"And in general, in design, in computer
science, black boxes just refer to",00:23:14.940,00:23:19.800
"pieces of functionality that someone
has implemented, and you don't",00:23:19.800,00:23:22.510
"necessarily know or care how it's
implemented underneath the hood.",00:23:22.510,00:23:26.140
"You just care that this black box,
which we'll now start calling a",00:23:26.140,00:23:28.960
"function, does something.",00:23:28.960,00:23:30.730
"&gt;&gt; So, for instance, if this black box on
the stage here represents printf, a",00:23:30.730,00:23:34.710
"function, I know from previous examples
that printf takes one or more",00:23:34.710,00:23:38.040
"arguments, and the first of those
arguments should be a string, like",00:23:38.040,00:23:40.910
"""hello, world."" Well, if I am the person
writing the program, and I want",00:23:40.910,00:23:44.780
"to use printf, I, for instance, might
take a piece of blank paper here and a",00:23:44.780,00:23:50.460
black marker and write on it--,00:23:50.460,00:23:55.060
"I misspelled ""world""--",00:23:55.060,00:23:56.580
H-E-L-L-O.,00:23:56.580,00:23:59.560
"&gt;&gt; So I'll take my black marker and I'll
write, as big and legibly as I can on",00:23:59.560,00:24:04.220
"this piece of paper, ""hello, world,"" And
now I claim this is my argument.",00:24:04.220,00:24:07.260
"This is a string represented with
a piece of white paper.",00:24:07.260,00:24:09.740
"And my input now to the function
printf is going to be this.",00:24:09.740,00:24:13.030
"So I am calling printf, passing
that argument as input to it.",00:24:13.030,00:24:18.250
"&gt;&gt; And now, I don't know how the person who
wrote printf did it years ago, but",00:24:22.110,00:24:26.740
"I do know from its documentation that
its purpose in life is to print what I",00:24:26.740,00:24:31.110
provide to it as input.,00:24:31.110,00:24:34.410
"And so, even though this implementation
is unbeknownst to me",00:24:34.410,00:24:40.630
"underneath the hood, now
I see, oh, it is done.",00:24:40.630,00:24:44.170
"It has printed something
on the screen.",00:24:44.170,00:24:45.740
"And now control of the program, if there
were more lines of code, would",00:24:45.740,00:24:49.070
have now returned to me.,00:24:49.070,00:24:51.070
And so the fact that Colton--,00:24:51.070,00:24:52.290
"bless his heart, is hiding here under
a table in front of all of you--",00:24:52.290,00:24:55.370
"is deliberate in that I don't know
and I don't care how printf is",00:24:55.370,00:24:59.530
implemented.,00:24:59.530,00:25:00.100
"I just know, again, from its
documentation, what it does and how I",00:25:00.100,00:25:03.390
am supposed to use it.,00:25:03.390,00:25:05.040
"&gt;&gt; Now, recall that printf could get
a little more sophisticated.",00:25:05.040,00:25:09.140
"Again, we're just talking about the
equivalent of Scratch's Say block.",00:25:09.140,00:25:12.220
But I also did this last time.,00:25:12.220,00:25:14.230
"I wanted to make my hello program a
little more dynamic and not just hard",00:25:14.230,00:25:17.270
"code something like ""world,"" and
definitely not hard code something",00:25:17.270,00:25:19.740
"arbitrary like D-A-V-I-D
into the program.",00:25:19.740,00:25:22.520
"I wanted to ask the user for his or her
name, and then do something with",00:25:22.520,00:25:27.510
that string that they provide.,00:25:27.510,00:25:29.720
"&gt;&gt; So there's something a little different
here. printf, a moment ago,",00:25:29.720,00:25:32.690
"did, indeed, do something, but it
didn't return anything to me.",00:25:32.690,00:25:35.860
Right?,00:25:35.860,00:25:36.020
"Colton did not hand me anything
back, no piece of paper.",00:25:36.020,00:25:38.910
There was just a side effect.,00:25:38.910,00:25:40.320
"My providing ""hello, world"" as an
argument to Colton resulted in the",00:25:40.320,00:25:44.510
"side effect of a word, some words,
appearing on the screen.",00:25:44.510,00:25:48.420
"&gt;&gt; getstring, though, is a little
different. getstring is also a",00:25:48.420,00:25:51.350
"function, but it returns some value.",00:25:51.350,00:25:54.590
"It doesn't just have an
aesthetic side effect.",00:25:54.590,00:25:56.370
"It actually gives me, the person
calling or using the function,",00:25:56.370,00:26:00.230
something back.,00:26:00.230,00:26:01.320
"So in this case, getstring is
called with getstring open",00:26:01.320,00:26:05.740
"paren, close paren.",00:26:05.740,00:26:07.510
"Does getstring, therefore, take
any arguments or input?",00:26:07.510,00:26:11.370
"No, it seems not.",00:26:11.370,00:26:12.340
"Its purpose in life is
just to get a string.",00:26:12.340,00:26:14.460
It needs no more detail than that.,00:26:14.460,00:26:16.910
"So let me go ahead and pretend that,
again, this black box is not printf,",00:26:16.910,00:26:20.430
"but getstring, and let me, the person
writing this program, call or use",00:26:20.430,00:26:25.160

"paren, getstring.",00:26:29.720,00:26:32.170
"&gt;&gt; Now, I have no idea how the CS50 staff
implemented getstring, but I know that",00:26:32.170,00:26:36.920
"if I wait long enough, it will do its
thing underneath the hood, maybe using",00:26:36.920,00:26:41.240
"some variables, maybe using some
conditions, maybe using some loops,",00:26:41.240,00:26:44.940

maybe using--",00:26:44.940,00:26:48.170
"just trying to stall-- maybe using
some other programming features.",00:26:48.170,00:26:52.290
"But if I wait long enough-- in reality,
in the computer, this happens",00:26:52.290,00:26:55.350
super fast--,00:26:55.350,00:26:56.270
"if I wait long enough, this function
getstring is going to get a string",00:26:56.270,00:26:59.910
"from the user, who is presumably typing
it out on their keyboard, and",00:26:59.910,00:27:04.060
"then, when you getstring is done getting
those characters from the user",00:27:04.060,00:27:08.090
"and storing them into a string, that
function, getstring, is going to have",00:27:08.090,00:27:14.080
"ready for me some output which I am
going to retrieve by way of the",00:27:14.080,00:27:17.990
assignment operator.,00:27:17.990,00:27:19.470
"&gt;&gt; And if I go, indeed, into the output
here, Obosi has generously",00:27:19.470,00:27:25.390
"participated, without knowing this in
advance, by writing his name onto this",00:27:25.390,00:27:29.900
"variable, which is representing
a string.",00:27:29.900,00:27:33.100
"Now, the assignment operator means, even
though this might feel a little",00:27:33.100,00:27:35.640
"redundant, I actually do need
to make my own copy of this.",00:27:35.640,00:27:38.790
"Because on the left hand
side-- whoops!--",00:27:38.790,00:27:40.700
"notice that I essentially have string
name on the left hand side.",00:27:40.700,00:27:45.760
"So I'm also going to make
my own copy of this.",00:27:45.760,00:27:48.280
"And this is a bit of a white lie,
because we'll see in a week or two's",00:27:48.280,00:27:50.990
"time that strings are not actually
what they appear to be.",00:27:50.990,00:27:54.100

"Here is my own copy of it after
using the assignment operator.",00:27:56.700,00:28:00.160
"And now, what do I want to do next?",00:28:00.160,00:28:01.790
"We now have the second
of two lines of code.",00:28:01.790,00:28:04.080
So I now want to call printf.,00:28:04.080,00:28:05.640
"Let's pretend now that the black
box is back again to being",00:28:05.640,00:28:08.500

take how many arguments?",00:28:10.210,00:28:12.200
"So look, it's like two.",00:28:14.890,00:28:16.770
"There's two commas in there, but
one of those commas, it's",00:28:16.770,00:28:18.860
inside of the quotes.,00:28:18.860,00:28:20.220
"So the first argument is literally
going to be this.",00:28:20.220,00:28:23.190
"H-E-L-L-O, comma, percent
s, backslash-n.",00:28:23.190,00:28:31.850
"And now I'm providing not one argument,
but two arguments to printf.",00:28:31.850,00:28:36.560
"&gt;&gt; And what's printf supposed to do with
these two inputs after I pass them in",00:28:36.560,00:28:39.530
as arguments?,00:28:39.530,00:28:42.050
"It's supposed to take the second of
them, which I called name, so the",00:28:42.050,00:28:45.360
"second piece of paper I wrote out
a moment ago is called name.",00:28:45.360,00:28:48.660
"It's going to plug of the value inside
of that variable into the placeholder,",00:28:48.660,00:28:53.550
"%s, so that, again, in just a moment's
time, we will see a side effect of",00:28:53.550,00:28:58.310
"having called printf, whereby now we
see not ""hello, world,"" but ""hello,",00:28:58.310,00:29:04.180
"Obosi.""",00:29:04.180,00:29:04.710
"&gt;&gt; So a big round of applause to both of
our volunteers, only one of whom knew",00:29:04.710,00:29:08.730
this would be happening.,00:29:08.730,00:29:12.010
All right.,00:29:12.010,00:29:12.990
"So, perhaps, simple as that was,
certainly, if you're already familiar",00:29:12.990,00:29:16.480
"with such, hopefully you will never
forget that particular visual of how",00:29:16.480,00:29:20.190
functions work.,00:29:20.190,00:29:21.220
&gt;&gt; So there's more than just getstring.,00:29:21.220,00:29:23.000
"Inside of the CS50 library, there's a
whole bunch of functions, all of which",00:29:23.000,00:29:26.020
"are capitalized just to make clear
that we wrote these functions.",00:29:26.020,00:29:29.510
"Typically, in C, almost every other
function you'll use is lowercase.",00:29:29.510,00:29:33.610
"But we deliberately use capital letters
just to make clear that these",00:29:33.610,00:29:36.190
"are training wheels of sorts that we'll
use for just a few weeks that",00:29:36.190,00:29:39.880
"simplify the process of getting
input from the user.",00:29:39.880,00:29:42.890
"&gt;&gt; The CS50 library does not do anything
that you yourselves could not do by",00:29:42.890,00:29:46.740
"just using C code from an
oldschool textbook.",00:29:46.740,00:29:50.230
"But, again, we use them as training
wheels of sorts for just a couple of",00:29:50.230,00:29:53.310
"weeks so that we can get rid of the
complexity that you'll soon understand",00:29:53.310,00:29:57.250
"yourself of doing something as
relatively straightforward as getting",00:29:57.250,00:30:00.460
input from a user.,00:30:00.460,00:30:02.080
"&gt;&gt; So know that you'll have access
to GetChar, GetDouble--",00:30:02.080,00:30:05.540
double.,00:30:05.540,00:30:06.050
What's-- and then GetFloat.,00:30:06.050,00:30:07.050
What's a float?,00:30:07.050,00:30:07.600
Let's start there.,00:30:07.600,00:30:09.382
&gt;&gt; STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].,00:30:09.382,00:30:10.600
&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: Yeah.,00:30:10.600,00:30:10.790
It's a number with a decimal point.,00:30:10.790,00:30:12.120
"So whereas an int is an integer, which
is just a number with 0 through 9,",00:30:12.120,00:30:15.930
"some number of repetitions thereof,
a float is something",00:30:15.930,00:30:18.940
with a decimal point.,00:30:18.940,00:30:20.100
"And a double, meanwhile, is also a
number with a decimal point, but more",00:30:20.100,00:30:26.090
"numbers after the decimal
point, potentially.",00:30:26.090,00:30:28.160
&gt;&gt; So we'll get back to this before long.,00:30:28.160,00:30:30.040
"But typically, each of these types of
data, each of these types of variables",00:30:30.040,00:30:34.560
"that a library like ours can return to
you, use different numbers of bits to",00:30:34.560,00:30:39.380
store information.,00:30:39.380,00:30:40.290
"Typically, a Char, which just means
one character, uses 8 bits.",00:30:40.290,00:30:43.910
"And that's actually consistent with our
byte of volunteers last week who",00:30:43.910,00:30:47.490
"came up and represented one
Ascii character at a time.",00:30:47.490,00:30:50.410
So a Char is 8 bits.,00:30:50.410,00:30:51.850
"&gt;&gt; A float happens to be
32 bits, typically.",00:30:51.850,00:30:54.430
"And a double, as you might guess, is
actually 64 bits, which is just more,",00:30:54.430,00:30:59.230
"which means you can have bigger
numbers or more precision.",00:30:59.230,00:31:01.360
"But again, more on that another time.",00:31:01.360,00:31:03.000
"GetLongLong, meanwhile, though stupidly
named, is really just a",00:31:03.000,00:31:06.550
"integer that's twice as big, twice as
long, potentially, as a regular",00:31:06.550,00:31:10.770
"integer, 64 bits instead of 32.",00:31:10.770,00:31:12.940
And GetString we've been using.,00:31:12.940,00:31:14.560
"&gt;&gt; But it turns out, in the CS50 library,
which is implemented, as we'll see, in",00:31:14.560,00:31:18.870
"the form of the two files, one of which
is called cs50.h, has two other",00:31:18.870,00:31:23.560
data types in it.,00:31:23.560,00:31:24.770
"Booleans do not exist in C. You can
simulate them by just using 0s and 1s",00:31:24.770,00:31:29.700
throughout your programs.,00:31:29.700,00:31:30.850
"But we in the CS50 library have created
the symbols ""true"" and ""false""",00:31:30.850,00:31:35.500
"to represent 1 and 0 so you don't
have to hard code something",00:31:35.500,00:31:38.580
literally like 1 and 0.,00:31:38.580,00:31:39.810
But we'll see those again.,00:31:39.810,00:31:40.980
"&gt;&gt; String, too, does not exist.",00:31:40.980,00:31:42.330
"And that's why I mentioned it's
a bit of a white lie for now.",00:31:42.330,00:31:44.520
"But we'll peel back that
layer before long.",00:31:44.520,00:31:46.660
"But for now, a string is a
sequence of characters.",00:31:46.660,00:31:49.540
"&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, in C, you indeed
have different data types.",00:31:49.540,00:31:51.790
Notice these are lowercase.,00:31:51.790,00:31:53.200
"So the functions you saw a moment ago
are functions written by CS50 that",00:31:53.200,00:31:56.960
"will return to you a value that falls
into one of these categories.",00:31:56.960,00:32:02.310
"&gt;&gt; A couple cheat sheets just to plant
the seed here. printf doesn't just",00:32:02.310,00:32:06.730
take %s as placeholders.,00:32:06.730,00:32:08.600
"It takes %d for decimal integers,
or %i would work as well.",00:32:08.600,00:32:13.490
"%f is floating point values. %c is for
a char, if you want to just plug one",00:32:13.490,00:32:19.450
"character into a preformatted string
like we've been doing, you can use %c.",00:32:19.450,00:32:23.510
"&gt;&gt; And then, somewhat annoyingly, %lld is
for a long, long decimal integer,",00:32:23.510,00:32:28.490
"which just means if you need a really
big number and you're using something",00:32:28.490,00:32:31.050
"called a long long, which we'll come
back to in a pset, you can use %lld to",00:32:31.050,00:32:35.450
"tell printf, plug in a really big
integer here by way of its second or",00:32:35.450,00:32:40.700
some other argument.,00:32:40.700,00:32:41.830
"&gt;&gt; And lastly, I promised that
there's a few other escape",00:32:41.830,00:32:45.700
sequences that printf supports.,00:32:45.700,00:32:47.670
We've seen backslash-n.,00:32:47.670,00:32:49.160
Backslash-r you may see.,00:32:49.160,00:32:50.510
It's sort of an old-school thing.,00:32:50.510,00:32:51.780
"If you ever used a real typewriter years
ago and you pulled on the crank",00:32:51.780,00:32:55.920
"which not only rotated the wheel to
move the lineup, it also moved the",00:32:55.920,00:32:59.810
"whole thing all the way back over to
the left, well, backslash-r just",00:32:59.810,00:33:03.730
"essentially moves your cursor back
to the start of the line",00:33:03.730,00:33:06.480
without moving it down.,00:33:06.480,00:33:07.830
"But again, more on that,
perhaps, in the future.",00:33:07.830,00:33:09.780
"&gt;&gt; Backslash-quote, backslash-double quote,
backslash-backslash is the",00:33:09.780,00:33:13.670
"solution to the tiny little riddle
I alluded to earlier.",00:33:13.670,00:33:16.600
"And backslash-0 is actually
quite interesting.",00:33:16.600,00:33:18.920
"But we'll come back to
that before long.",00:33:18.920,00:33:21.470
"&gt;&gt; So let me go into, now, the CS50
appliance, and let's actually do a",00:33:21.470,00:33:25.640
"quick warm up with one of the examples
we did already and then move on to",00:33:25.640,00:33:28.930
something a little more complex.,00:33:28.930,00:33:31.160
"So if I open up my program
called gedit--",00:33:31.160,00:33:34.980
this is my graphical editor.,00:33:34.980,00:33:36.840
And I can do that--,00:33:36.840,00:33:38.460
let me close that window there--,00:33:38.460,00:33:39.820
"by way of this icon down here,
gedit, in the bottom-left",00:33:39.820,00:33:42.720
corner next to the menu.,00:33:42.720,00:33:44.170
"&gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and advance, and
save this example into, say, John",00:33:44.170,00:33:48.670
Harvard's folder.,00:33:48.670,00:33:49.660
"John Harvard's folder is just his home
directory where all of his files live",00:33:49.660,00:33:52.690
by default.,00:33:52.690,00:33:53.340
"And I'm going to save this as
a file called hello-0.c.",00:33:53.340,00:33:58.410
"And I've chosen this name just so it
lines up with the sample code on the",00:33:58.410,00:34:01.260
"course's website and in the
YouTube videos online.",00:34:01.260,00:34:04.210
"&gt;&gt; So now I'm going to begin to
write my first program.",00:34:04.210,00:34:06.320
Let me zoom in for legibility.,00:34:06.320,00:34:08.469
"And I'm going to go ahead and say int
main void, which is just like that",00:34:08.469,00:34:12.760
"yellow puzzle piece that
starts a program.",00:34:12.760,00:34:14.900
"I have gotten into the habit over the
years of opening my curly brace, then",00:34:14.900,00:34:18.290
"also closing it and then going back to
where I want to put my code, just",00:34:18.290,00:34:22.000
"because it helps me keep everything
balanced, especially as my",00:34:22.000,00:34:24.630
program gets long.,00:34:24.630,00:34:25.880
"&gt;&gt; And now, in here, I'm going to go ahead
and say, printf, quote unquote,",00:34:25.880,00:34:29.239
"hello world, backslash-n, close quote,
close parenthesis, semicolon.",00:34:29.239,00:34:34.330
"So I'm just repeating everything we've
been taking for granted thus far.",00:34:34.330,00:34:38.100
Now I'm going to zoom out.,00:34:38.100,00:34:39.270
"&gt;&gt; And this terminal window down here, what
am I allowed to do in this black",00:34:39.270,00:34:43.030
and white window?,00:34:43.030,00:34:44.389
What can I use it for?,00:34:44.389,00:34:46.977
"So this is where I run commands and
where I can compile things.",00:34:46.977,00:34:49.770
And I'm going to keep it simple.,00:34:49.770,00:34:50.620
"I'm going to use a program
called Make, which isn't",00:34:50.620,00:34:52.780
technically a compiler.,00:34:52.780,00:34:54.020
"The compiler's called Clang, but
we'll come back to that in a",00:34:54.020,00:34:56.360
week or two's time.,00:34:56.360,00:34:57.190
"&gt;&gt; For now, I'm just going to type make
hello-0, But those of you who were",00:34:57.190,00:35:03.410
"comparing in your minds what I just
typed to what I should have typed may",00:35:03.410,00:35:07.050
"know already that I did
something wrong here.",00:35:07.050,00:35:10.180
"Now, there's clearly some errors.",00:35:10.180,00:35:12.160
"Before I even look at what they are, any
thoughts as to what I did wrong?",00:35:12.160,00:35:16.742
&gt;&gt; STUDENTS: [INTERPOSING VOICES].,00:35:16.742,00:35:18.590
&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: Yeah.,00:35:18.590,00:35:18.840
I'm missing the library's header file.,00:35:18.840,00:35:20.640
"Any of these .h files are called header
files, and they collectively",00:35:20.640,00:35:24.240
belong to things called libraries.,00:35:24.240,00:35:25.680
"Libraries are just chunks of code
that other people wrote.",00:35:25.680,00:35:28.030
"So the standard [? i ?] library is a
collection of files containing code",00:35:28.030,00:35:32.140
that other people wrote.,00:35:32.140,00:35:33.330
&gt;&gt; So I'm missing that.,00:35:33.330,00:35:34.820
So why am I getting an error?,00:35:34.820,00:35:36.520
"Well, let me scroll back up in
my terminal window here.",00:35:36.520,00:35:40.840
"And unfortunately, in C, as in a lot of
programming languages, especially",00:35:40.840,00:35:44.310
"if it's all new to you, the error
messages are precise, but they're also",00:35:44.310,00:35:47.830
quite cryptic.,00:35:47.830,00:35:48.620
"And the error here, in red, is
""implicitly declaring library function",00:35:48.620,00:35:51.720

to the next line, ""int const char * ,",00:35:51.720,00:35:57.660
"..."" It just gets really
overwhelming quickly.",00:35:57.660,00:36:00.220
"&gt;&gt; But what you should begin to do, if,
again, new to all of this, is just to",00:36:00.220,00:36:04.420
begin to look for keywords.,00:36:04.420,00:36:06.010
"Clearly, I might not understand half
of the words I'm seeing just yet.",00:36:06.010,00:36:08.770
"You will, though, in a week's time.",00:36:08.770,00:36:10.140
But I see printf.,00:36:10.140,00:36:11.230
"And that should begin, before long, to
jog your memory, all right, printf.",00:36:11.230,00:36:14.310
Something's wrong with printf.,00:36:14.310,00:36:15.210
Did I spell it wrong?,00:36:15.210,00:36:16.580
"No, it doesn't look like-- oh.",00:36:16.580,00:36:18.130
"I can't use it unless I teach
the compiler that it exists.",00:36:18.130,00:36:21.350
"And so, again, go with your instincts,
even if you don't actually understand",00:36:21.350,00:36:25.220
the actual error messages.,00:36:25.220,00:36:26.510
"&gt;&gt; And indeed, the solution here is to just
include it at the top of the file",00:36:26.510,00:36:30.240
"like that, resaving my file with
Control-S or the File menu.",00:36:30.240,00:36:34.340
"And if I now go back down here,
I'm going to clear this.",00:36:34.340,00:36:36.730
"Control-L is just a nice way
to clear the screen.",00:36:36.730,00:36:39.150
"And then I'm going to type ""make hello
0"" Enter, and now I still see a",00:36:39.150,00:36:44.870
"cryptic sequence of symbols, but
we'll come back to that.",00:36:44.870,00:36:47.710
That's what Make is doing for you.,00:36:47.710,00:36:49.230

that this thing should work.",00:36:54.050,00:36:57.460

%s.,00:37:31.150,00:37:32.200
"&gt;&gt; And now, how many arguments should
printf take this time?",00:37:32.200,00:37:35.040
So two.,00:37:35.040,00:37:35.700
So I go outside of the quotes.,00:37:35.700,00:37:37.090
"I type ""name"" after a comma.",00:37:37.090,00:37:39.330
"But I've done something
else wrong this time.",00:37:39.330,00:37:41.550
"But let's assume that I didn't
realize that yet.",00:37:41.550,00:37:43.940
Let me go up here.,00:37:43.940,00:37:44.910
"&gt;&gt; And notice, too, I'm getting a little
bored of typing ""make hello 0"" all the",00:37:44.910,00:37:48.850
"time, ""make"" and all this.",00:37:48.850,00:37:50.180
"So, it turns out, in Linus you can
often hit the Up arrow on your",00:37:50.180,00:37:53.270
"keyboard, and you can actually scroll
through all of the commands that I've",00:37:53.270,00:37:56.850
executed previous to just now.,00:37:56.850,00:37:58.830
"So if I do that, Up, Up,
there's make hello 0.",00:37:58.830,00:38:02.040
I don't want that.,00:38:02.040,00:38:02.610
"I just want to change that to
hello 1 this time, Enter.",00:38:02.610,00:38:05.450
"Eventually, that will
save you some time.",00:38:05.450,00:38:07.620
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:38:07.620,00:38:08.150
"Unfortunately, there's is an error.",00:38:08.150,00:38:09.520
So let me scroll up.,00:38:09.520,00:38:10.980
"This looks like I really
butchered this program.",00:38:10.980,00:38:13.120
"I mean, my god, it's two lines of code,
and its 10 lines of errors.",00:38:13.120,00:38:16.530
But look at the top one first.,00:38:16.530,00:38:18.800
Use of undeclared identifier string.,00:38:18.800,00:38:21.640
Did I mean standard i n?,00:38:21.640,00:38:23.270
No I didn't.,00:38:23.270,00:38:23.930
I meant string.,00:38:23.930,00:38:24.940
"&gt;&gt; But where is the string variable
type declared, dd we say?",00:38:24.940,00:38:29.390
So it's in the CS50 the library.,00:38:29.390,00:38:30.730
"So it doesn't suffice, in these first
couple of weeks, just to use",00:38:30.730,00:38:33.740
what C gives us.,00:38:33.740,00:38:34.860
"I'm also going to go up here, and I
could put it above or below, but I'll",00:38:34.860,00:38:38.120
"just keep it alphabetical
to keep things orderly.",00:38:38.120,00:38:40.340
"I'm going to include cs50.h,

own computers.,00:38:47.640,00:38:48.450
But it comes with the CS50 appliance.,00:38:48.450,00:38:50.700
"&gt;&gt; So now let me go back and recompile
this with make hello 1.",00:38:50.700,00:38:55.320
Damn it.,00:38:55.320,00:38:55.710
Still another error.,00:38:55.710,00:38:57.240
"Let me scroll up to the first, though.",00:38:57.240,00:38:59.370
This one's a little complex.,00:38:59.370,00:39:00.630
Multi-character character constant.,00:39:00.630,00:39:03.830
That's not helping me.,00:39:03.830,00:39:04.890
"But notice, Clang is at least a little
bit decent, whereby with a little",00:39:04.890,00:39:08.220
"green caret symbol, it's saying
here is where I screwed up.",00:39:08.220,00:39:11.890
"Why is it pointing, with that little
green arrow, to the single quote next",00:39:11.890,00:39:16.160
to my name?,00:39:16.160,00:39:18.290
"&gt;&gt; So this is one of the things you just
get used to, especially if you've been",00:39:18.290,00:39:20.880
"programming in Python, or JavaScript,
or other languages where this detail",00:39:20.880,00:39:23.980
doesn't matter.,00:39:23.980,00:39:24.560
"In C, it does matter.",00:39:24.560,00:39:25.740
"If you are declaring a string, which is
a sequence of 0 or more characters,",00:39:25.740,00:39:29.520
you actually must use double quotes.,00:39:29.520,00:39:32.280
"So I actually need to change this back
to open quote, close quote, with",00:39:32.280,00:39:36.670
double quotes.,00:39:36.670,00:39:37.800
"Single quotes do have their place, but
only when you're using individual",00:39:37.800,00:39:41.610
"chars, but more on that another time.",00:39:41.610,00:39:44.100
"For now, the double quotes
are necessary.",00:39:44.100,00:39:46.550
"&gt;&gt; So now, let me go back to my terminal
window, make hello 1.",00:39:46.550,00:39:50.460
And who's confident?,00:39:50.460,00:39:51.450
"Is this program now going
to compile correctly?",00:39:51.450,00:39:53.800
OK.,00:39:58.250,00:39:58.540
So three of us think this.,00:39:58.540,00:39:59.780
All right.,00:39:59.780,00:40:00.280
Enter.,00:40:00.280,00:40:01.190
And it actually did.,00:40:01.190,00:40:02.440
"So there's no errors this time, even
though this program's gotten a bit",00:40:02.440,00:40:05.130
more complex.,00:40:05.130,00:40:05.840
"If I now do dot slash hello 1, Enter,
it's going to say ""hello, David.""",00:40:05.840,00:40:10.110
"&gt;&gt; But let's do the third iteration
of this, where the",00:40:10.110,00:40:11.750
program is truly dynamic.,00:40:11.750,00:40:13.380
"Let me go ahead and change the file
name, just for consistency with the",00:40:13.380,00:40:16.770
"files you'll have available
to you afterward online.",00:40:16.770,00:40:20.410
Enter.,00:40:20.410,00:40:21.620
"And now I'm going to go in and not
store ""David"" hard coded here.",00:40:21.620,00:40:25.510
"What could I do to very simply
improve this program?",00:40:25.510,00:40:28.826
&gt;&gt; I could call getstring.,00:40:28.826,00:40:30.520
"It might be a little non-obvious what's
about to happen, so I'm going",00:40:30.520,00:40:33.240
"to actually add another line, printf,
and say name, colon, close quote, just",00:40:33.240,00:40:38.470
"to give the user a prompt
on the screen.",00:40:38.470,00:40:40.790
"And now I'm going to go here, and I'm
going to use my keyboard shortcut.",00:40:40.790,00:40:42.980
"I'm going to go Up, Up, and change
hello 1 to hello 2, Enter.",00:40:42.980,00:40:47.680
"And thankfully, I'm making progress.",00:40:47.680,00:40:49.260
"&gt;&gt; And now I'm going to go up
to dot slash hello and",00:40:49.260,00:40:52.720
"change that to 2, Enter.",00:40:52.720,00:40:54.690
And now my program--,00:40:54.690,00:40:55.650
"I'll zoom in-- is getting
a little prettier.",00:40:55.650,00:40:57.700
"Name is going to be, let's say Rob
this time, Enter, hello, Rob.",00:40:57.700,00:41:02.190
We can do it again.,00:41:02.190,00:41:03.260
"Name, Lauren, Enter.",00:41:03.260,00:41:05.360
"Name, Joseph, Enter.",00:41:05.360,00:41:07.820
"Name, let's try to be
difficult, Enter.",00:41:07.820,00:41:11.596
Eh.,00:41:11.596,00:41:12.410
It's not really a bug.,00:41:12.410,00:41:14.680
So it's just a little ugly.,00:41:14.680,00:41:16.090
"So maybe we could solve this
in the future, not now.",00:41:16.090,00:41:18.640
"&gt;&gt; But how would you instinctively
go about addressing",00:41:18.640,00:41:20.840
that particular challenge?,00:41:20.840,00:41:21.990
It just looks stupid.,00:41:21.990,00:41:23.710
"How do you avoid things
looking stupid?",00:41:23.710,00:41:27.320
"So we could do, OK, I heard a couple
of things, a condition and a loop.",00:41:27.320,00:41:29.890
"We could use, one, a condition, to check
what is the length of the string",00:41:29.890,00:41:33.340
the user gave us?,00:41:33.340,00:41:34.190
"And if it's 0, it's just quote unquote,
they just hit Enter, then",00:41:34.190,00:41:37.100
"maybe I should yell at them
and prompt them again.",00:41:37.100,00:41:38.930
But how do a prompt them again?,00:41:38.930,00:41:39.970
"Well, I also heard loop, and I could
do that again and again and again",00:41:39.970,00:41:44.230
prompting the user for the same thing.,00:41:44.230,00:41:47.010
"&gt;&gt; Well, let's do one other example
using a different",00:41:47.010,00:41:48.880
function in the CS50 library.,00:41:48.880,00:41:50.620
Let me close this file.,00:41:50.620,00:41:52.330
Let me create a new one.,00:41:52.330,00:41:53.510
"And I'll call it adder.c, just because
it's easy to do simple arithmetic,",00:41:53.510,00:41:58.510
"even though this will be completely
underwhelming with what you could do",00:41:58.510,00:42:00.890
with any modern computer.,00:42:00.890,00:42:02.250
&gt;&gt; But let me go ahead now and--,00:42:02.250,00:42:03.750
"I learned my lesson last time-- include
cs50.h, include stdio.h, int",00:42:03.750,00:42:10.680
"main void, which, for now, I'll just
take on blind faith, but we'll assume",00:42:10.680,00:42:14.170
"that will understand what
that means before long.",00:42:14.170,00:42:16.380
"And I'm going to say something
like ""give me an int.""",00:42:16.380,00:42:21.030
"&gt;&gt; And now, how do I get an int?",00:42:21.030,00:42:22.140
"I want to ultimately declare a variable
called x of type int and",00:42:22.140,00:42:26.820
store in it an integer from the user.,00:42:26.820,00:42:29.240
So that was a mouthful.,00:42:29.240,00:42:29.970
"But if someone wants to propose, how
do I declare an integer called x?",00:42:29.970,00:42:35.680
Int x.,00:42:35.680,00:42:36.310
&gt;&gt; So it really is that simple.,00:42:36.310,00:42:37.430
Give me an int.,00:42:37.430,00:42:38.240
Call it x.,00:42:38.240,00:42:39.070
Now I use the assignment operator.,00:42:39.070,00:42:40.580
"And how do I store from the
left a value of the user?",00:42:40.580,00:42:43.400
"I don't want to call getstring,
obviously, but rather getint.",00:42:43.400,00:42:47.310
Any arguments?,00:42:47.310,00:42:49.060
No.,00:42:49.060,00:42:49.350
"So it's open paren, close paren
immediately, and then a",00:42:49.350,00:42:51.870
semicolon ends the line.,00:42:51.870,00:42:53.440
&gt;&gt; Now let me do this again.,00:42:53.440,00:42:54.930
Give me another int.,00:42:54.930,00:42:57.070
"This time I'll do int, let's
call it y, equals getint.",00:42:57.070,00:43:01.850
"And now let me do something super-simple
like some math.",00:43:01.850,00:43:05.060
"So printf, the sum of %d is the
placeholder for an int.",00:43:05.060,00:43:14.340
"And %d, period, backslash-n.",00:43:14.340,00:43:20.030
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:43:20.030,00:43:20.360
So that's not actually math.,00:43:20.360,00:43:21.670
"But if I want to say the sum of this
value plus this value equals this",00:43:21.670,00:43:25.500
"other value, how many arguments into
total should I be giving printf,",00:43:25.500,00:43:29.320
ultimately?,00:43:29.320,00:43:30.520
"So four, right?",00:43:30.520,00:43:31.420
This string and then the three values.,00:43:31.420,00:43:33.790
"So x is the first I want to be
plugged in first to the %d.",00:43:33.790,00:43:37.560
y is going to be the next.,00:43:37.560,00:43:39.270
"&gt;&gt; And now I kind of want to say
z, but z doesn't exist.",00:43:39.270,00:43:42.030
But that's not a big deal.,00:43:42.030,00:43:43.190
"Because what would you do instinctively,
especially if you had a",00:43:43.190,00:43:45.440
"graphing calculator, what do you type?",00:43:45.440,00:43:47.820
How about x plus y?,00:43:47.820,00:43:48.760
So it's not an actual variable.,00:43:48.760,00:43:50.200
"It's just the sum of two
other variables.",00:43:50.200,00:43:51.820
And that's perfectly legitimate.,00:43:51.820,00:43:53.170
"C certainly understands simple
arithmetic like this.",00:43:53.170,00:43:56.630
"&gt;&gt; Semicolon, save.",00:43:56.630,00:43:58.450
"Now let me go down here and
type make adder, Enter.",00:43:58.450,00:44:02.080
"No error, so that's progress too.",00:44:02.080,00:44:04.100
Type adder.,00:44:04.100,00:44:04.890
"And another keyboard shortcut,
if you start to get bored",00:44:04.890,00:44:07.100
with all the commands--,00:44:07.100,00:44:08.760
"if you start typing a command, like dot
slash ad, and that's where your",00:44:08.760,00:44:12.650
"boredom kicks in, you can usually hit
Tab to have the computer finish the",00:44:12.650,00:44:16.020
"rest of the phrase for you if it's not
ambiguous what should come after ad.",00:44:16.020,00:44:20.510
"&gt;&gt; So let me go ahead now
and you click Enter.",00:44:20.510,00:44:23.950
"Give me an int, 1, 2, and
thankfully, it's 3.",00:44:23.950,00:44:27.490
"But as always, testing programs
shouldn't reduce to",00:44:27.490,00:44:29.900
just trying it once.,00:44:29.900,00:44:30.820
"Let me try a corner case, like negative
1, give me 1, and that one",00:44:30.820,00:44:35.560
checks out as well.,00:44:35.560,00:44:36.210
"And I probably want to do some more
rigorous testing, but I'm pretty",00:44:36.210,00:44:38.870
comfortable with where that's at.,00:44:38.870,00:44:40.630
"&gt;&gt; Well, now let's try another program
that this time uses a",00:44:40.630,00:44:43.110
bit of other syntax.,00:44:43.110,00:44:44.620
Let me create a new file.,00:44:44.620,00:44:46.100
"I'll call this conditions0.c to line
up with some sample code online.",00:44:46.100,00:44:51.050
"And let me go ahead and do
include cs50.h, include",00:44:51.050,00:44:55.550
"stdio.h, in main void--",00:44:55.550,00:45:00.320
OK.,00:45:00.320,00:45:01.030
There we go.,00:45:01.030,00:45:01.850
We have our standard boilerplate.,00:45:01.850,00:45:03.010
"&gt;&gt; And this time I'm going to say printf,
""I'd like an int, please,"" just to",00:45:03.010,00:45:08.170
"make the prompt a little
more friendly.",00:45:08.170,00:45:10.030
"And now I want to get an
int from the user.",00:45:10.030,00:45:11.620
"I'm going to call it n this time, just
because n sounds like number.",00:45:11.620,00:45:15.010
"getint, and now, what do
I want to do with it?",00:45:15.010,00:45:18.140
"Well, if n is-- and I'll zoom in--",00:45:18.140,00:45:21.640
"if n is greater than 0, I want
to do the following--",00:45:21.640,00:45:25.930
"printf ""You picked a positive number.""
Else, I'm going to type printf ""You",00:45:25.930,00:45:36.060
picked a negative,00:45:36.060,00:45:37.870
"number."" All right.",00:45:37.870,00:45:39.650
"So this program, even though I did it
fast, looks right syntactically.",00:45:39.650,00:45:44.410
Let me try this.,00:45:44.410,00:45:45.010
Make condition 0.,00:45:45.010,00:45:46.890
Seems to run.,00:45:46.890,00:45:47.710
"Condition 0, enter.",00:45:47.710,00:45:49.230
Let's give it an int of 50.,00:45:49.230,00:45:51.910
I picked a positive number.,00:45:51.910,00:45:53.160
Let's try it again.,00:45:53.160,00:45:54.230
Condition 0.,00:45:54.230,00:45:54.930
Negative 50.,00:45:54.930,00:45:56.260
I picked a negative number.,00:45:56.260,00:45:57.290
"&gt;&gt; But now, let me pick what we'll keep
calling a corner case, which is more",00:45:57.290,00:46:00.350
"an interesting case that you think
might give you some trouble, 0.",00:46:00.350,00:46:04.702
"Now, I'm pretty sure this is one of
those corner cases where zero is",00:46:04.702,00:46:07.940
"neither positive nor negative, so my
program, though in syntactically",00:46:07.940,00:46:12.330
"correct-- it compiles, it runs--
is not logically correct.",00:46:12.330,00:46:15.440
"So what's the simple fix here if I want
to detect, if I want to handle n",00:46:15.440,00:46:21.050
equals 0 separately?,00:46:21.050,00:46:23.840
"&gt;&gt; So if n equals 0, then I want to say
something like printf ""You picked 0.""",00:46:23.840,00:46:32.980
Let me try this now.,00:46:32.980,00:46:33.990
"Let me go back here, clear
my window, and recompile.",00:46:33.990,00:46:38.320
Hm.,00:46:38.320,00:46:38.690
One error generate.,00:46:38.690,00:46:39.770
"But I do you want to check
if n equals 0.",00:46:39.770,00:46:41.630
"&gt;&gt; So again, another stupid thing
to get used to, equal sign is",00:46:44.230,00:46:47.720
the assignment operator.,00:46:47.720,00:46:48.910
"So this is actually mistake in that,
technically, even though the compiler",00:46:48.910,00:46:52.240
"protected me from myself, we'd
technically be copying 0 into n, which",00:46:52.240,00:46:56.450
is not what I want.,00:46:56.450,00:46:57.590
"I want to test for equality
with equals equals.",00:46:57.590,00:47:00.950
"And so that now might be
my better solution.",00:47:00.950,00:47:03.390
"&gt;&gt; Let me actually resave this as, say,
conditions1, to be new and improved.",00:47:03.390,00:47:07.810
"So now if I recompile this,
it would make conditions--",00:47:07.810,00:47:10.480
"whoops-- make conditions1 dot slash
conditions1, Enter, ""I'd like an int,",00:47:10.480,00:47:16.960
"please."" I'm going to go
ahead and type 50.",00:47:16.960,00:47:18.760
It's still good.,00:47:18.760,00:47:19.660
"Negative 50, still good.",00:47:19.660,00:47:21.200
"0, and it, indeed, detected
that I picked 0.",00:47:21.200,00:47:24.920
&gt;&gt; So what more can I now do with this?,00:47:24.920,00:47:28.200
"Well, we can certainly do increasingly
complex things.",00:47:28.200,00:47:32.280
"But what I'd like to propose is
that we end on this note here.",00:47:32.280,00:47:37.240
"If we pull up this, you'll see, perhaps,
a favorite cartoon of yours",00:47:37.240,00:47:41.680
"up until today you might
never have understood.",00:47:41.680,00:47:43.326
"And that's about the quality of laughter
you should get with CS jokes.",00:47:46.550,00:47:49.520
So that's about right.,00:47:49.520,00:47:51.060
"&gt;&gt; But more compellingly, I thought I'd
give us a little teaser for Monday.",00:47:51.060,00:47:54.900
So we've started using integers.,00:47:54.900,00:47:56.430
We've referred to floats.,00:47:56.430,00:47:57.510
"We've even referred to doubles,
which, again, give you numbers",00:47:57.510,00:48:00.120
after decimal points.,00:48:00.120,00:48:01.390
"&gt;&gt; But it turns out that floats and
doubles, and, really, computers,",00:48:01.390,00:48:04.230
"fundamentally, cannot express
some values precisely.",00:48:04.230,00:48:08.470
"We know from math classes that you can
have any number of numbers after the",00:48:08.470,00:48:12.840
decimal point.,00:48:12.840,00:48:13.510
"And you can even put a vertical bar
to say these go on forever.",00:48:13.510,00:48:16.460
"&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, you can't really
do that in a computer.",00:48:16.460,00:48:18.810
And so corner cases arise.,00:48:18.810,00:48:20.400
"For instance, suppose you're
doing something financial.",00:48:20.400,00:48:23.120
"You're doing mathematics
with percentages, and",00:48:23.120,00:48:25.700
with dollars and cents.,00:48:25.700,00:48:27.030
"And those cents don't
necessarily line up.",00:48:27.030,00:48:29.230
"Well, it turns out that fractions of
pennies can start to add up when",00:48:29.230,00:48:34.120
"modeled with a computer system
in such a way that clever",00:48:34.120,00:48:37.250
humans can take advantage.,00:48:37.250,00:48:39.100
"&gt;&gt; And those of you who haven't seen, I'd
like to give you a 30-second teaser of",00:48:39.100,00:48:42.650
"a wonderful film known as Office Space,
which will paint a picture of a",00:48:42.650,00:48:48.290
"problem we shall tackle
first thing on Monday.",00:48:48.290,00:48:51.205
"If we could raise the volume
a little bit, I give you 30",00:48:51.205,00:48:53.960
seconds of Office Space.,00:48:53.960,00:48:55.495

do anything illegal.",00:49:10.160,00:49:12.030
&gt;&gt; -Illegal?,00:49:12.030,00:49:12.660
"Samir, this is America.",00:49:12.660,00:49:15.075
&gt;&gt; -We have to swear to God.,00:49:15.075,00:49:16.570

but us, all right?",00:49:16.570,00:49:19.070
"No family members, no
girlfriends, nobody.",00:49:19.070,00:49:21.920
&gt;&gt; -Of course.,00:49:21.920,00:49:22.700
&gt;&gt; -Agreed.,00:49:22.700,00:49:23.320
