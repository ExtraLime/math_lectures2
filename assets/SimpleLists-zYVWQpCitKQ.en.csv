"ANA BELL: So we have
a list L, originally,",00:00:23.430,00:00:27.620
"[life, answer, 42, 0].",00:00:27.620,00:00:29.050
"In this example,
if you don't know",00:00:34.160,00:00:37.680
"Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy,",00:00:37.680,00:00:39.900
that's why 42 is important.,00:00:39.900,00:00:43.010
"As a scientist, if I
didn't at least one example",00:00:43.010,00:00:46.380
"with the number 42, I'd
probably hear about it.",00:00:46.380,00:00:49.330
So here it is.,00:00:49.330,00:00:51.570
"OK, so we have this
original list L,",00:00:51.570,00:00:54.120
"which contains the
string ""life"", the string",00:00:54.120,00:00:56.040
"""answer"", the number
42, and the number 0.",00:00:56.040,00:00:59.460
"Here, I'm writing a loop that
iterates over every element",00:00:59.460,00:01:03.060
"directly in L, right?",00:01:03.060,00:01:05.980
"So originally, thing is going
to be string ""life"", then, thing",00:01:05.980,00:01:13.780
"is going to be the
string ""answer"", then,",00:01:13.780,00:01:15.830
"thing is going to
be the number 42.",00:01:15.830,00:01:18.540
"And so what am I doing inside
the loop as I'm iterating?",00:01:18.540,00:01:22.090
"Well, if thing is equal to
0, then I'm going to do this.",00:01:22.090,00:01:27.170
"And otherwise, I'm
going to do this.",00:01:27.170,00:01:29.200
"So for the first
two iterations when",00:01:29.200,00:01:31.109
"thing is equal to
""life"" or ""answer"",",00:01:31.109,00:01:32.650
I'm not doing anything.,00:01:32.650,00:01:34.960
"As soon as I hit 42 though,
I'm saying, L, at position 1,",00:01:34.960,00:01:43.300
"is going to get
this value here, OK?",00:01:43.300,00:01:46.660
"So when I've iterated over this
element here, I'm saying L,",00:01:46.660,00:01:50.140
"at position 1, I'm going to
change its value, which says,",00:01:50.140,00:01:53.574
"well, I'm going to
keep ""life"" the same,",00:01:53.574,00:01:55.240
"but this is going
to be ""everything"".",00:01:55.240,00:01:58.810
"And then we're keeping the
rest the same, 42 and 0,",00:01:58.810,00:02:01.280
"because we're only
modifying L at position 1.",00:02:01.280,00:02:04.839
"As soon as we do
that, we've finished",00:02:04.839,00:02:06.380
with the loop when L was 42.,00:02:06.380,00:02:09.259
And then we go through 0.,00:02:09.259,00:02:14.790
"So now, thing takes
on the value 0.",00:02:14.790,00:02:17.880
"And we say, if thing is equal
to 0, well, we're good on that.",00:02:17.880,00:02:21.520
"L, at position thing,
is equal to ""universe"".",00:02:21.520,00:02:24.460
"So L, at position 0,
is equal to ""universe"".",00:02:24.460,00:02:26.430
"So that says, OK, I'm going to
replace ""life"" with ""universe"".",00:02:26.430,00:02:30.780
"And then everything else
stays the same-- 42 and 0, OK?",00:02:30.780,00:02:37.070
"So that would be my answer,
[universe, everything, 42, 0].",00:02:37.070,00:02:42.720
"Great, that's the majority.",00:02:42.720,00:02:46.060
Good job.,00:02:46.060,00:02:47.730
