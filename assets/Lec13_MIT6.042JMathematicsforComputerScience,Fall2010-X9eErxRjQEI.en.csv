"PROFESSOR: OK,
let's get started.",00:00:22.790,00:00:26.120
"Last time we looked at a
variety of ways to analyze sums",00:00:26.120,00:00:30.560
"and to find closed-form
expressions for the sums.",00:00:30.560,00:00:33.900
"And today we're going to
use those methods to solve",00:00:33.900,00:00:37.440
"a variety of famous problems,
one of them involving center",00:00:37.440,00:00:41.920
of mass and stacking blocks.,00:00:41.920,00:00:44.370
"We saw a version
of that yesterday",00:00:44.370,00:00:46.810
"in recitation, where you solved
the problem of figuring out",00:00:46.810,00:00:50.000
"how many L's you need to make
something like this balance",00:00:50.000,00:00:55.150
perfectly.,00:00:55.150,00:00:56.870
"Now in this case I didn't
actually get an integer number",00:00:56.870,00:01:00.250
"of L's-- which is possible--
because I didn't quite get it",00:01:00.250,00:01:02.750
stacked right at the bottom.,00:01:02.750,00:01:04.230
So I got 10 and 1/2 L's here.,00:01:04.230,00:01:06.150
There's an extra vertical here.,00:01:06.150,00:01:08.660
"Now in theory there are two
integer ways of doing it.",00:01:08.660,00:01:12.990
"And you proved that
yesterday in recitation.",00:01:12.990,00:01:15.430
"So in theory, 10
and 11 should work,",00:01:15.430,00:01:18.060
"but in practice the
blocks aren't perfect.",00:01:18.060,00:01:20.170
"I didn't get them
perfectly lined up.",00:01:20.170,00:01:22.000
"And so 10 wouldn't quite
work, and 11 tended",00:01:22.000,00:01:24.640
to pitch it the other way.,00:01:24.640,00:01:26.530
"And of course in theory, as
long as the center of mass",00:01:26.530,00:01:29.890
"is just anywhere over this
block, it's going to be stable.",00:01:29.890,00:01:34.080
"In practice there's air moving
around, and bouncing and stuff.",00:01:34.080,00:01:37.550
"And so if you're close to
the edge, it's going over.",00:01:37.550,00:01:40.900
OK.,00:01:40.900,00:01:41.420
"So now if you want to build
one of these yourself,",00:01:41.420,00:01:43.503
it's not hard to do.,00:01:43.503,00:01:46.110
"You just start with an
extra block here, all right,",00:01:46.110,00:01:48.864
and then you build up.,00:01:48.864,00:01:49.780
And that's easy.,00:01:49.780,00:01:50.446
"And then you notice
when it's about right.",00:01:50.446,00:01:52.912
"And you can just start
wiggling this block out.",00:01:52.912,00:01:54.870
"And then it looks pretty
cool at that point.",00:01:54.870,00:01:57.850
"Actually it was a student
in the class showed me this",00:01:57.850,00:02:01.057
"a couple of years ago, because
we were doing the blocks.",00:02:01.057,00:02:03.390
"The next thing we're going
to do-- we were doing that--",00:02:03.390,00:02:04.780
"and he said, hey,
there's this thing.",00:02:04.780,00:02:06.321
"And yeah, pretty cool.",00:02:06.321,00:02:08.150
"So today we're going to
look at a different problem,",00:02:08.150,00:02:11.039
"and that's the problem of
getting the blocks stacked up",00:02:11.039,00:02:15.150
"so they go out over the edge of
the table-- if that's doable.",00:02:15.150,00:02:19.950
"So the goal is to stack
the blocks up like this.",00:02:19.950,00:02:30.840
We go farther and farther out.,00:02:30.840,00:02:32.920
"And the question
we're going to look at",00:02:32.920,00:02:35.410
is is it possible-- whoa.,00:02:35.410,00:02:39.410
Almost.,00:02:39.410,00:02:39.910
"Is it possible to get a block
all the way off the table?",00:02:39.910,00:02:43.909
"That's the question
we're going to look at.",00:02:43.909,00:02:45.700
And here I got close.,00:02:45.700,00:02:47.440
"And you can see it's
getting a little tipsy.",00:02:47.440,00:02:50.215
It's not going to go.,00:02:50.215,00:02:51.090
It's going to fall over.,00:02:51.090,00:02:53.450
So I didn't do it this time.,00:02:53.450,00:02:56.030
"You're only allowed
one block per level.",00:02:56.030,00:02:59.360
"So you can't do
anything like this.",00:02:59.360,00:03:04.110
That's not allowed.,00:03:04.110,00:03:05.590
"You can go backwards,
if that helps you.",00:03:05.590,00:03:10.680
"Well it's got to be
stable on both sides.",00:03:10.680,00:03:13.570
But you can go back and forth.,00:03:13.570,00:03:16.220
"So the question is, can you
get out one block totally",00:03:16.220,00:03:19.370
out over the table?,00:03:19.370,00:03:21.360
"How many people think
it can't be done?",00:03:21.360,00:03:25.160
All right.,00:03:25.160,00:03:25.660
A few doubters.,00:03:25.660,00:03:26.810
More doubters.,00:03:26.810,00:03:27.830
How many think it can be done?,00:03:27.830,00:03:30.180
"Oh, a lot of people
think it can be done.",00:03:30.180,00:03:31.930
OK.,00:03:31.930,00:03:32.750
Well all right.,00:03:32.750,00:03:35.300
"How many people think
you can get a block",00:03:35.300,00:03:38.540
two blocks out over the table?,00:03:38.540,00:03:42.080
A few of you.,00:03:42.080,00:03:43.940
"How many think you can
get it three blocks out?",00:03:43.940,00:03:48.230
You're believers.,00:03:48.230,00:03:49.020
OK.,00:03:49.020,00:03:50.430
"How many people think
I can reach that wall?",00:03:50.430,00:03:53.840
"Well I got to tell you I
can't reach the wall because--",00:03:53.840,00:03:56.540
"AUDIENCE: The ceiling
gets in the way.",00:03:56.540,00:03:58.123
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:03:58.123,00:03:59.020
That's going to be hard to do.,00:03:59.020,00:04:00.900
"But this is what we're
going to try to figure out.",00:04:00.900,00:04:03.560
"And we're going to do it
with a little competition.",00:04:03.560,00:04:06.280
"So we're going to have a team
of you go up against the TAs.",00:04:06.280,00:04:12.050
"And the winner gets
candy to share.",00:04:12.050,00:04:17.079
"The losing team gets the
infamous 6042 Nerd Pride pocket",00:04:17.079,00:04:21.519
protectors.,00:04:21.519,00:04:23.030
Very nice.,00:04:23.030,00:04:23.940
Shiny plastic.,00:04:23.940,00:04:24.990
Has the MIT logo on them.,00:04:24.990,00:04:27.100
Very handy.,00:04:27.100,00:04:28.310
All right.,00:04:28.310,00:04:28.810
So I need four volunteers.,00:04:28.810,00:04:31.730
"So come on down if
you'd like to volunteer.",00:04:31.730,00:04:33.710
"You can win some
candy for the class--",00:04:33.710,00:04:35.400
"or at least win yourself
a pocket protector.",00:04:35.400,00:04:38.810
"And we'll put the
class over there.",00:04:38.810,00:04:42.020
And we get the TAs to come down.,00:04:42.020,00:04:45.610
So come on down.,00:04:45.610,00:04:46.460
I got a couple of people.,00:04:46.460,00:04:47.501
Who else wants to join them?,00:04:47.501,00:04:48.920
All right.,00:04:48.920,00:04:49.420
Come on down.,00:04:49.420,00:04:50.910
"We've got a fourth
volunteer out there?",00:04:50.910,00:04:54.307
All right.,00:04:57.271,00:04:57.770
We got some people coming down.,00:04:57.770,00:04:59.061
"All right, come on over.",00:04:59.061,00:05:00.430
All right.,00:05:00.430,00:05:00.930
You got all the blocks you want.,00:05:00.930,00:05:02.270
"We could even take
this thing down.",00:05:02.270,00:05:04.660
So here's your supply.,00:05:04.660,00:05:08.660
All right.,00:05:08.660,00:05:09.490
"Now the TAs have a little
bit of an advantage,",00:05:09.490,00:05:11.810
"because they've done this
before, some of them.",00:05:11.810,00:05:15.960
"So you can give some advice
to your colleagues here.",00:05:15.960,00:05:19.070
"So you got to get some blocks
out of the block supply.",00:05:19.070,00:05:21.460
Maybe we should take this down.,00:05:21.460,00:05:22.751
It's about to fall over anyway.,00:05:22.751,00:05:25.180
"So yeah, how do
we get this down?",00:05:25.180,00:05:27.550
I'm not sure.,00:05:27.550,00:05:30.576
"All right, I got this end.",00:05:30.576,00:05:31.770
Whoa!,00:05:34.476,00:05:35.380
There we go.,00:05:35.380,00:05:35.940
Whoa!,00:05:35.940,00:05:36.940

Oops!,00:05:37.940,00:05:38.940
All right.,00:05:38.940,00:05:41.883
There we go.,00:05:41.883,00:05:42.383

out over the farthest wins.",00:05:50.020,00:05:53.870

"Believe me it's a
lot easier if you can",00:05:57.625,00:05:59.250
do multiple blocks per level.,00:05:59.250,00:06:00.670
You can go back and forth.,00:06:05.080,00:06:06.590
"Go ahead and give
them some advice.",00:06:06.590,00:06:08.680

a block out so far.",00:06:11.280,00:06:13.385

"This is an interesting
idea I think",00:06:25.780,00:06:27.280
"is to go out as far as possible
and then just weight it back.",00:06:27.280,00:06:30.556
Does that change anything?,00:06:30.556,00:06:32.858
Like this you're saying?,00:06:32.858,00:06:35.095

time for a vote.",00:09:35.820,00:09:39.560
"But let the class
see what you did.",00:09:39.560,00:09:43.061
"Yeah you got to
take your hands off.",00:09:43.061,00:09:44.560
That's you know.,00:09:44.560,00:09:45.270
AUDIENCE: We can.,00:09:45.270,00:09:45.453
We're just choosing not to.,00:09:45.453,00:09:46.578
"PROFESSOR: Get some good
top balancing on there.",00:09:49.340,00:09:51.340
I don't know.,00:09:54.714,00:09:55.678
All right.,00:10:00.240,00:10:00.740
Can you let it go?,00:10:00.740,00:10:01.970
All right.,00:10:01.970,00:10:02.470
They let it go.,00:10:02.470,00:10:03.095
Let's see.,00:10:03.095,00:10:03.690
Did you get one out?,00:10:03.690,00:10:04.853
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:10:04.853,00:10:05.477
This one right here.,00:10:05.477,00:10:06.340
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:10:06.340,00:10:07.215
We're going to do a vote.,00:10:07.215,00:10:08.320
"Who thinks they got
the one farthest out?",00:10:08.320,00:10:13.350
Oh it's close.,00:10:13.350,00:10:14.730
Ah!,00:10:14.730,00:10:15.230
Look at that.,00:10:15.230,00:10:16.550
We need some glasses out there.,00:10:16.550,00:10:18.080
"Who thinks the TAs
got it farther out?",00:10:18.080,00:10:21.186
AUDIENCE: Boo.,00:10:21.186,00:10:22.182
PROFESSOR: Oh man.,00:10:22.182,00:10:23.050
All right.,00:10:23.050,00:10:25.555
All right.,00:10:25.555,00:10:26.055
So you guys.,00:10:26.055,00:10:27.270
Here you go.,00:10:27.270,00:10:28.050
"Your very nice
pocket protectors.",00:10:28.050,00:10:29.650
A good effort.,00:10:29.650,00:10:30.865
There you are.,00:10:30.865,00:10:31.840
Well done.,00:10:31.840,00:10:33.860
"And I'm afraid they
get the candy here.",00:10:33.860,00:10:37.480
"So you can take these out and
share them with the class.",00:10:37.480,00:10:39.942
"Oh, leave it that way.",00:10:42.184,00:10:43.100
Leave it there.,00:10:43.100,00:10:43.500
"I mean, we're going
to analyze yours,",00:10:43.500,00:10:44.970
"because I can't begin
to analyze that.",00:10:44.970,00:10:46.553
All right.,00:10:50.241,00:10:50.740
"Now watching this,
how many people",00:10:50.740,00:10:52.460
"still think we can get it
all the way to the wall?",00:10:52.460,00:10:56.020
"Ah, a few people.",00:10:56.020,00:10:56.860
"In fact, if you stack
this high enough--",00:10:56.860,00:10:59.830
"and we're going to analyze
how high it has to go--",00:10:59.830,00:11:02.250
you could reach the wall.,00:11:02.250,00:11:03.870
"Now in fact we're going
to find that you probably",00:11:03.870,00:11:05.990
"got to go out to the
stars to get that high",00:11:05.990,00:11:09.010
before you can reach the wall.,00:11:09.010,00:11:10.490
So it's not too practical.,00:11:10.490,00:11:13.750
"Now what I want to do is
analyze this strategy.",00:11:13.750,00:11:18.130
"And this sort of looks
like a nice design.",00:11:18.130,00:11:19.880
"They got out there
with just five.",00:11:19.880,00:11:21.800
"And they did a
particular approach",00:11:21.800,00:11:25.070
"using what we could call
as the greedy algorithm.",00:11:25.070,00:11:27.500
"We've seen greedy
algorithms before.",00:11:27.500,00:11:29.580
"And they used another
greedy algorithm here.",00:11:29.580,00:11:32.370
"Now what their greedy strategy
did-- and I'm going to redo it",00:11:32.370,00:11:36.820
"here-- is stack all the
blocks right at the edge.",00:11:36.820,00:11:42.770
"Line it up here and,
starting at the top,",00:11:42.770,00:11:46.680
"push it out as
far as you can go.",00:11:46.680,00:11:50.230
"Now in this case, we can
get it out about halfway,",00:11:50.230,00:11:53.250
"because the center of mass of
this block is at halfway point.",00:11:53.250,00:11:56.889
"And that better be
sitting over this block,",00:11:56.889,00:11:58.680
or it's going to tip.,00:11:58.680,00:12:01.020
So the top block goes out here.,00:12:01.020,00:12:03.860
"Now I'm going to slide
the top two blocks out",00:12:03.860,00:12:06.590
as far as they go.,00:12:06.590,00:12:07.738
All right.,00:12:11.240,00:12:11.790
That's about the tip.,00:12:11.790,00:12:13.170
"Then I slide the top three
out as far as they go.",00:12:13.170,00:12:18.500
Whoa!,00:12:18.500,00:12:19.840
Almost.,00:12:19.840,00:12:22.600
Oops.,00:12:22.600,00:12:24.020
"Theory is always
easier than practice.",00:12:24.020,00:12:27.030
"And now we do the
top four blocks.",00:12:27.030,00:12:30.600
"And they did a better
job than I did.",00:12:30.600,00:12:34.120
"But that's the algorithm,
OK, the greedy algorithm.",00:12:34.120,00:12:36.960
"The top i blocks-- when i
goes 1 to n-- push it out",00:12:36.960,00:12:40.020
as far as you can go.,00:12:40.020,00:12:41.480
All right.,00:12:41.480,00:12:41.980
"And we're going to
analyze that strategy",00:12:41.980,00:12:47.840
and see how far it goes.,00:12:47.840,00:12:49.108
So we're given n blocks.,00:12:57.750,00:13:02.410
"And let's say they all have
length 1, to make it easy.",00:13:02.410,00:13:05.365
"And we're going to define r
sub i to be the amount by which",00:13:10.130,00:13:15.010
"the i'th block hangs
out over the edge.",00:13:15.010,00:13:17.380
"and we're going to
count from the top.",00:13:30.108,00:13:31.691
All right.,00:13:44.830,00:13:45.330
So let's see this on a picture.,00:13:45.330,00:13:49.270
So I got the table here.,00:13:49.270,00:13:51.080
"And then I'm stacking the blocks
out in some way like this.",00:13:55.220,00:14:02.160
"And with a greedy strategy,
you don't ever go backwards.",00:14:02.160,00:14:04.555
All right.,00:14:12.400,00:14:12.900
So I'm defining this distance.,00:14:12.900,00:14:15.980
This is block one.,00:14:15.980,00:14:19.110
This distance here is r 1.,00:14:19.110,00:14:26.240
This distance is r 2.,00:14:26.240,00:14:31.470
"This one is r 3-- and so forth,
until you get down to here.",00:14:31.470,00:14:34.710
"This is r n, because
this is the n'th block,",00:14:34.710,00:14:38.080
"and it extends out
r n from the table.",00:14:38.080,00:14:40.610
"And this is 0 here,
which the table--",00:14:40.610,00:14:43.590
"we'll consider the table to
be the n plus first block.",00:14:43.590,00:14:45.860
So r n plus 1 is 0.,00:14:45.860,00:14:49.940
OK.,00:14:49.940,00:14:51.330
"And so using the strategy--
the greedy strategy--",00:14:51.330,00:14:53.820
we want to know what's r 1?,00:14:53.820,00:14:56.170
"We want to compute that-- if
I keep pushing the blocks out",00:14:56.170,00:15:00.040
"in a topward fashion
as far as they'll go.",00:15:00.040,00:15:02.970
"Now the constraint is
the stability constraint",00:15:02.970,00:15:06.850
so it won't fall over.,00:15:06.850,00:15:08.171
"The stability constraint says
that the center of mass--",00:15:15.930,00:15:24.970
"we'll call it C k--
of the top k blocks",00:15:24.970,00:15:37.010
"must lie on the k
plus first block.",00:15:37.010,00:15:40.149
Otherwise it'll tip over.,00:15:40.149,00:15:41.190
"And of course the table is
block n plus 1 in this context.",00:15:49.090,00:15:53.775
OK.,00:16:02.100,00:16:02.840
"So if at any point
we've got k blocks,",00:16:02.840,00:16:07.550
"and their center of
mass is out here,",00:16:07.550,00:16:11.200
they'll fall over at that point.,00:16:11.200,00:16:13.040
"Or if you are
building it this way,",00:16:13.040,00:16:14.850
they would fall over that way.,00:16:14.850,00:16:16.390
All right.,00:16:16.390,00:16:16.890
"So for each set of the top
k blocks, the center of mass",00:16:16.890,00:16:19.680
has to be on the block below.,00:16:19.680,00:16:21.280
"And if it is, we're fine.",00:16:21.280,00:16:23.300
It won't fall over.,00:16:23.300,00:16:24.602
Now for the greedy stacking.,00:16:27.410,00:16:28.840
"Where is the center
of mass of the top k",00:16:39.540,00:16:41.940
"blocks in the greedy
stacking, the way",00:16:41.940,00:16:44.630
"we defined them in terms
of these variables.",00:16:44.630,00:16:49.270
What is C k?,00:16:49.270,00:16:50.446
All right.,00:16:54.870,00:16:55.370
"So I got the top k
blocks r k plus 1.",00:16:55.370,00:17:02.190
"The center of mass of the top
k blocks by the greedy strategy",00:17:02.190,00:17:06.089
"is right at the edge
of the k'th block.",00:17:06.089,00:17:09.349
"So if this is a block k here,
then this is r k plus 1.",00:17:09.349,00:17:15.131
"That's where the
center of mass has",00:17:15.131,00:17:16.589
"to be of all these
blocks-- the top k blocks.",00:17:16.589,00:17:20.500
"If it's a little bit more,
it's going to fall over.",00:17:20.500,00:17:23.270
"If it's less, then
it's not greedy.",00:17:23.270,00:17:25.480
"We didn't push it out
as far as it could go.",00:17:25.480,00:17:28.510
All right.,00:17:28.510,00:17:30.010
"So for the greedy stacking,
C k is equal to r k plus 1.",00:17:30.010,00:17:33.250
"And r n plus 1 of course
is the edge of the table.",00:17:36.550,00:17:42.090
That's zero.,00:17:42.090,00:17:42.830
Any questions so far?,00:17:45.880,00:17:48.540
What we're doing?,00:17:48.540,00:17:50.500
OK.,00:17:50.500,00:17:51.570
All right.,00:17:51.570,00:17:52.080
"So let's figure out where the
center of mass of the top k",00:17:52.080,00:17:55.180
"blocks is-- a formula for
that-- a recursive formula.",00:17:55.180,00:17:59.600
"So to do that we look
at the center of mass",00:17:59.600,00:18:03.280
"of the k'th block by itself,
and then average it in with",00:18:03.280,00:18:06.970
"the center of mass of
the top k minus 1 blocks.",00:18:06.970,00:18:10.551
OK.,00:18:10.551,00:18:11.050
"So we're going to set up a
recursion to compute C k.",00:18:11.050,00:18:15.560
"Where is the center of mass of
the k'th block just by itself?",00:18:15.560,00:18:23.150
"The center of mass
of the k'th block.",00:18:23.150,00:18:26.280
This guy.,00:18:26.280,00:18:26.780
Where is its center of mass?,00:18:26.780,00:18:29.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:18:29.970,00:18:30.870
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, r
k plus 1 minus 0.5.",00:18:32.670,00:18:35.840
"Because the center
of mass of this block",00:18:35.840,00:18:38.200
is 1/2 from the right edge.,00:18:38.200,00:18:40.860
"And the right edge
is-- oh, it's r k.",00:18:40.860,00:18:45.450
Sorry.,00:18:45.450,00:18:46.315
All right?,00:18:46.315,00:18:46.900
The top.,00:18:46.900,00:18:47.590
Yeah this is.,00:18:47.590,00:18:48.560
What?,00:18:48.560,00:18:49.060
What did I do here?,00:18:49.060,00:18:49.851
"Oh, the top k.",00:18:49.851,00:18:50.451
Sorry.,00:18:50.451,00:18:50.950
"This is the k'th block,
the way I had it.",00:18:50.950,00:18:53.074
Here's the k'th.,00:18:53.074,00:18:53.740
So it is r k minus a half.,00:18:53.740,00:18:56.519
That's right.,00:18:56.519,00:18:57.060
This is r k plus 1 down here.,00:18:57.060,00:18:59.161
All right.,00:18:59.161,00:18:59.660
"Because the right edge of
the k'th block is at r k,",00:18:59.660,00:19:02.730
"the center of mass
is 1/2 left of that.",00:19:02.730,00:19:06.320
All right.,00:19:06.320,00:19:06.820
"So we know that the center of
mass of the k'th block is at r",00:19:06.820,00:19:20.860
k minus 1/2.,00:19:20.860,00:19:24.180
All right.,00:19:24.180,00:19:24.870
"Now we can compute another
expression for C k.",00:19:24.870,00:19:27.980
"The center of mass
of the top k blocks",00:19:30.520,00:19:45.610
"is C k equals-- well there's
k minus 1 block centered",00:19:45.610,00:19:53.660
"at C k minus 1, because
the center of mass",00:19:53.660,00:19:56.990
"of the top k minus 1 block's
by definition is C k minus 1.",00:19:56.990,00:20:00.180
And they have weight k minus 1.,00:20:00.180,00:20:02.910
"And then we average that with
a k'th block that has weight 1",00:20:02.910,00:20:05.700
at position r k minus 1/2.,00:20:05.700,00:20:08.930
"And the total weight of
this is k minus 1 here,",00:20:08.930,00:20:13.980
and one for this block.,00:20:13.980,00:20:16.160
"So this equals KC
k minus 1 minus--",00:20:16.160,00:20:24.160
let me write it better here.,00:20:24.160,00:20:25.600
k minus 1.,00:20:25.600,00:20:27.860
"C k minus 1 plus R k
minus 1/2 all over k.",00:20:27.860,00:20:36.140
All right.,00:20:36.140,00:20:36.640
"So now we've got an expression--
a recursive expression--",00:20:36.640,00:20:39.670
for C k.,00:20:39.670,00:20:40.780
"And to simplify it, we're
going to plug in that-- C k",00:20:44.820,00:20:48.425
"as r k plus 1 for
the greedy strategy.",00:20:48.425,00:20:50.470
Yeah?,00:20:50.470,00:20:52.104
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:20:52.104,00:20:54.570
PROFESSOR: L is 1.,00:20:54.570,00:20:55.900
"The length of the blocks is
1, here to make it simpler.",00:20:55.900,00:20:59.427
"Otherwise it would
have been a half L.",00:20:59.427,00:21:01.010
"So yesterday we talked
about length L blocks.",00:21:01.010,00:21:03.890
"Today they're length
1, to be simple.",00:21:03.890,00:21:06.870
All right.,00:21:06.870,00:21:07.370
"So now for the
greedy strategy, I'm",00:21:07.370,00:21:08.828
"just going to plug
in C k as r k plus 1.",00:21:08.828,00:21:12.580
So let's do that.,00:21:12.580,00:21:15.680
"So I got C k as r k plus
1 equals zero k minus 1.",00:21:15.680,00:21:24.830
"Well C k minus 1 is just R
k plus R k minus 1/2 over K.",00:21:24.830,00:21:37.090
"And this simplifies
to k r k minus r k",00:21:37.090,00:21:43.130
"plus r k-- they cancel--
minus 1/2 over k.",00:21:43.130,00:21:49.010
This equals r k minus 1/2.,00:21:49.010,00:21:52.790
So getting very simple now.,00:21:52.790,00:21:56.020
"And I'm just going
to rewrite this",00:21:56.020,00:21:57.780
"to look at the difference
between r k and r k plus 1.",00:21:57.780,00:22:02.950
So r k minus r k plus 1 Oops.,00:22:02.950,00:22:07.562
I made a mistake.,00:22:07.562,00:22:08.270
That's 1 over 2 k.,00:22:08.270,00:22:09.700
Half over k is 1 over 2K.,00:22:09.700,00:22:12.100
"Any questions about
the math we did?",00:22:16.500,00:22:20.921

"This is one of those problems
where the math this way",00:22:21.420,00:22:23.970

"There are other ways to
try to solve this problem",00:22:25.099,00:22:27.140

"But this one's a
simple approach.",00:22:29.380,00:22:32.220
What's the meaning of this?,00:22:32.220,00:22:34.030
"What's an interpretation
of r k minus r k plus 1?",00:22:34.030,00:22:39.090

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:22:39.703,00:22:40.578

the k plus first block.,00:22:47.270,00:22:49.160
So let's see that.,00:22:49.160,00:22:51.398
All right.,00:22:51.398,00:22:52.170
So here's r 1.,00:22:52.170,00:22:54.230
Here's r 2.,00:22:54.230,00:22:56.020

Here's r 2 two minus r 3.,00:23:02.010,00:23:04.700
It's that distance.,00:23:04.700,00:23:06.841

All right.,00:23:17.311,00:23:17.810
"So now we can write

6.,00:23:56.430,00:23:57.270
All right.,00:23:57.270,00:23:57.950

see what the TAs did,",00:23:57.950,00:24:00.030

"So that's just equal to the

All right.,00:24:55.210,00:24:55.710
Now I got r 1 minus r n plus 1.,00:24:55.710,00:24:59.990
But what's r n plus 1?,00:24:59.990,00:25:03.810
0.,00:25:03.810,00:25:04.350

"The table doesn't
hang out over itself.",00:25:05.080,00:25:06.980

"in mathematics and computer
science, it has a special name.",00:25:31.090,00:25:34.260
It's called the harmonic sum.,00:25:34.260,00:25:36.150
"And the numbers are called
the harmonic numbers.",00:25:36.150,00:25:39.790

the sum of the n reciprocals.,00:25:53.990,00:25:55.655
All right.,00:26:00.310,00:26:00.810
"So for example, the first
harmonic number is 1.",00:26:00.810,00:26:04.810
"The second is 1
plus 1/2 equals 3/2.",00:26:04.810,00:26:10.510
"The third is 3/2 plus
1/3, which is 11/6.",00:26:10.510,00:26:21.130
"The fourth harmonic
number is that plus 1/4.",00:26:21.130,00:26:27.340
22 plus 3/12 is 25/12.,00:26:27.340,00:26:29.816
"That's sort of an
interesting number,",00:26:32.449,00:26:33.990
because it's bigger than 2.,00:26:33.990,00:26:37.380
What does that tell us?,00:26:37.380,00:26:39.691
"Why is that interesting
from this perspective",00:26:39.691,00:26:41.565
of what we're doing here?,00:26:41.565,00:26:44.790
"Now you can get a
block off the table.",00:26:44.790,00:26:47.070
"Because R1, the distance
that the top block hangs out",00:26:47.070,00:26:50.230
"off the table, is half
the harmonic number.",00:26:50.230,00:26:53.690
"Half of H 4 is a little
bit bigger than 1.",00:26:53.690,00:26:57.930
"Which means with four blocks the
top block can be off the table.",00:26:57.930,00:27:02.580
Now the TAs did it using five.,00:27:02.580,00:27:04.880
"I didn't even get it
to work with five.",00:27:04.880,00:27:06.780
In theory it'll work with 12.,00:27:06.780,00:27:08.950
"You can hang one out
there just a 24th",00:27:08.950,00:27:11.380
"beyond the edge of
the table in theory.",00:27:11.380,00:27:15.040

"If we kept on going,
h of a million--",00:27:15.540,00:27:19.920
"the millionth harmonic number,
if you were to go compute it,",00:27:19.920,00:27:23.490
is 14.3927 and some other stuff.,00:27:23.490,00:27:29.000

"how far would I get the
top block off the table?",00:27:32.910,00:27:37.230
Seven blocks.,00:27:37.230,00:27:38.910
All right.,00:27:38.910,00:27:39.410
So that gives you an idea.,00:27:39.410,00:27:40.493
"You have to do a lot
of work to get seven.",00:27:40.493,00:27:44.020
"And in fact it's hard,
because the bottom block",00:27:44.020,00:27:46.720
"would be hanging out one
two millionth of a block.",00:27:46.720,00:27:49.500
All right?,00:27:49.500,00:27:50.000
"So you're adding up
a lot of tiny things",00:27:50.000,00:27:51.670
to get to seven out there.,00:27:51.670,00:27:52.800
"Now it turns out that
the harmonic numbers",00:27:54.460,00:27:56.860
grow to infinity.,00:27:56.860,00:27:58.729
And we'll see that.,00:27:58.729,00:27:59.520
"But they grow very, very slowly.",00:27:59.520,00:28:02.760

closed-form expression",00:28:08.130,00:28:11.210

"I don't think so,
because I don't",00:28:14.690,00:28:16.750

"In fact it's [? probably ?]
believed that it doesn't exist.",00:28:20.575,00:28:25.150
"So what do we do to get a
good estimation of that sum?",00:28:25.150,00:28:30.208
What do we do?,00:28:34.360,00:28:35.852
AUDIENCE: Integration bounds.,00:28:35.852,00:28:37.060
"PROFESSOR: The
integration bounds.",00:28:37.060,00:28:38.110
Yeah.,00:28:38.110,00:28:38.450
"Because we're not going
to get a closed form.",00:28:38.450,00:28:40.410
"At least I don't know of
anybody who knows how to do it.",00:28:40.410,00:28:44.260
"So we'll use the
integration bounds.",00:28:44.260,00:28:45.810
"And what kind of
function are we summing?",00:28:57.260,00:28:59.460
Is it increasing or decreasing?,00:28:59.460,00:29:03.000
Decreasing.,00:29:03.000,00:29:03.660
Yep.,00:29:03.660,00:29:05.790
"So we'll use the formula
we did last time.",00:29:05.790,00:29:08.158
All right.,00:29:14.221,00:29:14.720
"And that formula is that the
sum i equals 1 to n of f of i",00:29:14.720,00:29:23.980
"is, at most, the first
term plus the integral.",00:29:23.980,00:29:28.042
"And it's at least the last
term plus the integral.",00:29:31.730,00:29:35.370
All right.,00:29:42.100,00:29:42.600
"In this case we have
f of i as 1 over i.",00:29:42.600,00:29:45.680
"So the first step is to
compute the integral.",00:29:51.140,00:29:54.197
And that's pretty easy.,00:30:02.250,00:30:03.530
"That's just the natural log
of x evaluated at n and 1.",00:30:03.530,00:30:08.520
And that's easy.,00:30:08.520,00:30:10.070
"That's just the
natural log of n.",00:30:10.070,00:30:12.990
"So the integral
is very easy here.",00:30:12.990,00:30:15.930
"And now we actually
can just plug in",00:30:15.930,00:30:17.720
and get really good bounds.,00:30:17.720,00:30:18.883
"Maybe I'll save
that just in case.",00:30:22.100,00:30:23.868
"OK so plugging in
into the bounds f of n",00:30:42.600,00:30:46.740
"is 1 over n plus the
integral is log of n",00:30:46.740,00:30:51.620
"is less than or equal to
the n'th harmonic number.",00:30:51.620,00:30:54.860
"And it's upper
bounded by f of 1,",00:30:54.860,00:30:57.190
which is 1 plus the integral.,00:30:57.190,00:31:01.798
All right.,00:31:01.798,00:31:02.550
So that's really good.,00:31:02.550,00:31:03.520
We got very tight bounds.,00:31:03.520,00:31:05.410
"And now you can see that
the n'th harmonic number--",00:31:05.410,00:31:08.220
how fast is it growing?,00:31:08.220,00:31:09.800
"If I were to use tilde
notation, what would I write?",00:31:09.800,00:31:14.620
As log n.,00:31:14.620,00:31:15.381
Yeah.,00:31:15.381,00:31:15.880
"So this means that h
of n is tilde log of n.",00:31:15.880,00:31:20.047
"Now this is such an
important function",00:31:22.750,00:31:25.080
"that people have gone
to a lot of extra work--",00:31:25.080,00:31:27.640
"which we can't do in this
class-- to really nail down",00:31:27.640,00:31:32.810
the value-- get it much closer.,00:31:32.810,00:31:34.260
"And in fact it's now known
that it's the natural log of n",00:31:34.260,00:31:40.560
"plus 1 over 2n plus 1 over
12n squared plus epsilon of n",00:31:40.560,00:31:49.360
"over 120n to the
fourth where for all n",00:31:49.360,00:31:58.080
epsilon n is between 0 and 1.,00:31:58.080,00:32:00.730
Oop.,00:32:04.661,00:32:05.160
And I left one piece out.,00:32:05.160,00:32:08.230
"Actually there's a constant
term in here-- delta--",00:32:08.230,00:32:11.990
that's called Euler's constant.,00:32:11.990,00:32:15.230
"Delta is called
Euler's constant,",00:32:15.230,00:32:21.630
"and equals 0.577215664
and some other stuff.",00:32:21.630,00:32:32.131
"And in fact to this
day people don't",00:32:32.131,00:32:33.630
"know if this constant is
rational or irrational.",00:32:33.630,00:32:37.760
"But they know it to a
lot of decimal places.",00:32:37.760,00:32:42.200
"So basically H n is the log of n
plus some fixed value between 0",00:32:42.200,00:32:48.250
"and 1-- as we knew
it had to be--",00:32:48.250,00:32:50.110
"plus even some tail
terms here that",00:32:50.110,00:32:52.120
get very small as n gets large.,00:32:52.120,00:32:55.630
All right.,00:32:55.630,00:32:56.130
"So say I wanted to using
this greedy strategy.",00:32:56.130,00:33:00.070
"How many blocks I would need

"How many blocks do I need
using this strategy, roughly?",00:33:09.300,00:33:13.880

I think somebody said it.,00:33:20.390,00:33:23.190

"So I need the harmonic
number to be 200.",00:33:30.020,00:33:36.070

about n to get this to be 200?",00:33:36.070,00:33:40.401
e to the 200.,00:33:43.840,00:33:45.100
All right.,00:33:45.100,00:33:45.600

need an exponential",00:33:45.600,00:33:48.030
"in 200 number of blocks, which
now we're past the stars,",00:33:48.030,00:33:51.350

greedy strategy-- is optimal.,00:33:59.480,00:34:02.710
"There is no way to get a block
farther out over the edge.",00:34:02.710,00:34:07.660
"That said, there is a
second way to get there.",00:34:07.660,00:34:11.080
"And in the second way, the top
block is not the optimal block.",00:34:11.080,00:34:15.380
"In the second way, it's the
second block that goes out.",00:34:15.380,00:34:18.196
So it looks something like that.,00:34:18.196,00:34:19.529
"So there's a
counterweight on it.",00:34:19.529,00:34:21.730
"And in the text, when
you read chapter nine,",00:34:21.730,00:34:24.320
"you will see the proof
that shows that there's",00:34:24.320,00:34:27.699
two solutions that are optimal.,00:34:27.699,00:34:29.000
"One's a greedy, and
one's this other one",00:34:29.000,00:34:30.666
"that sort of is mostly the
greedy, except the top couple",00:34:30.666,00:34:33.599
of blocks are different.,00:34:33.599,00:34:34.810
And it proves that's optimal.,00:34:34.810,00:34:36.150
We won't cover that in class.,00:34:36.150,00:34:37.790
"Now actually in the
literature today people",00:34:40.580,00:34:42.830
"have been studying how
far a block can go out",00:34:42.830,00:34:45.900
"if you're allowed to do more
than one block per level,",00:34:45.900,00:34:48.310
"like one of the
students wanted to do.",00:34:48.310,00:34:50.870
"So if you're allowed
to have multiple blocks",00:34:50.870,00:34:53.429
"on the same level, it turns
out you can get much farther",00:34:53.429,00:34:57.460
out with n blocks.,00:34:57.460,00:34:58.900
"And right now it's known
that it's something like n",00:34:58.900,00:35:02.400
"to the third is how
far you can get out,",00:35:02.400,00:35:04.830
"which is much better
than log of n.",00:35:04.830,00:35:07.310
"And so mathematicians have
been studying that problem.",00:35:07.310,00:35:10.950
"Any questions about
the block stacking?",00:35:10.950,00:35:15.420
OK.,00:35:18.360,00:35:19.331
All right.,00:35:19.331,00:35:19.830
So that's basically it for sums.,00:35:19.830,00:35:24.130
"I do want to spend a little
time talking about products.",00:35:24.130,00:35:27.190
"And that may get us back
into sums pretty quick.",00:35:27.190,00:35:29.340
"The most famous product
out there is n factorial.",00:35:32.410,00:35:37.690
"And once we get to
counting and probability,",00:35:37.690,00:35:40.900
"probably every
lecture we're going",00:35:40.900,00:35:42.410
"to be looking at n factorial
one way or another.",00:35:42.410,00:35:45.530
Just comes up all the time.,00:35:45.530,00:35:48.595
"n factorial is the product
of i equals 1 to n of i.",00:35:48.595,00:35:54.610
"It's the product of the first
n natural numbers after zero.",00:35:54.610,00:36:02.530
"Now we'd like to be able to
get a closed-form expression",00:36:02.530,00:36:05.280
"for this, because factorial
is really not closed form,",00:36:05.280,00:36:07.600
because it's hiding this thing.,00:36:07.600,00:36:10.870
"And if I ask you how big is
n factorial, sort of hard",00:36:10.870,00:36:15.040
"to say how big it is,
how fast it grows.",00:36:15.040,00:36:19.560
"Any ideas about how we might
go about doing a product to get",00:36:19.560,00:36:24.970
a closed-form expression?,00:36:24.970,00:36:26.676
"AUDIENCE: If you take a
logarithm of a product,",00:36:26.676,00:36:28.634
you get a sum.,00:36:28.634,00:36:29.770
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, good.",00:36:29.770,00:36:31.170
Take the log of it.,00:36:31.170,00:36:32.341
"Well, let's write that out--
1 times 2 times 3 to n.",00:36:36.970,00:36:43.980
"That equals the log of
1 plus the log of 2.",00:36:43.980,00:36:47.470
Whoops.,00:36:50.347,00:36:50.847
All right.,00:36:53.441,00:36:53.940
So I've now got a sum.,00:36:53.940,00:36:55.420
"And now that I've got a sum
we can use all the tools",00:37:01.005,00:37:05.150
we had for sums.,00:37:05.150,00:37:06.650
"So really, products
look hairy, but they're",00:37:06.650,00:37:09.750
no different than sums.,00:37:09.750,00:37:11.399
"Because we're going to
get an approximation",00:37:11.399,00:37:13.190
"or get an answer for
[? login ?] n factorial.",00:37:13.190,00:37:15.640
"Then we'll exponentiate it,
and we'll have the answer.",00:37:15.640,00:37:18.660
All right.,00:37:18.660,00:37:19.160
So we're looking at this sum.,00:37:19.160,00:37:21.540
"And so how do I get a
closed form for that?",00:37:21.540,00:37:26.200
"Turns out nobody
knows the closed form.",00:37:26.200,00:37:30.010
"But we do know a method that
approximates it very well,",00:37:30.010,00:37:35.100
which is the integration bounce.,00:37:35.100,00:37:39.470
"Only in this case, it's
an increasing function.",00:37:39.470,00:37:43.450
So let's do that.,00:37:43.450,00:37:44.320
OK.,00:38:05.450,00:38:05.960
So let's do that.,00:38:05.960,00:38:06.930
And the formula is easy.,00:38:21.620,00:38:22.760
"It's basically the same
formula we had there--",00:38:22.760,00:38:25.770
"that the sum i equals
1 to n of f of i",00:38:25.770,00:38:30.740
"is at most the n'th
term plus the integral.",00:38:30.740,00:38:34.996
"And it's at least the first
term plus the integral.",00:38:37.950,00:38:42.590
All right.,00:38:47.006,00:38:47.760
"Now in this case f
of i is the log of i.",00:38:47.760,00:38:51.165
"And so we need to compute
the integral of log of x.",00:38:54.890,00:39:03.300
And that's easy.,00:39:03.300,00:39:04.060
"That's x ln of x minus
x evaluated at n and 1.",00:39:04.060,00:39:11.950
"And that's just n
log of n minus n.",00:39:11.950,00:39:15.641
"If I plug in 1, I get a 0 here,
and I'm subtracting negative 1",00:39:19.410,00:39:23.250
there.,00:39:23.250,00:39:25.901
All right.,00:39:25.901,00:39:26.400
"And so now we'll just plug
this into the integral",00:39:26.400,00:39:30.633
and we'll get our bounce.,00:39:30.633,00:39:31.674
So f of 1.,00:39:34.890,00:39:37.700
What is f of 1 in this case?,00:39:37.700,00:39:42.370
"Yeah, 0.",00:39:42.370,00:39:44.980
"Plus n ln n minus
n plus 1 less than",00:39:44.980,00:39:52.140
"equal to log of n factorial,
less than or equal to f of n",00:39:52.140,00:39:59.580
is log of n.,00:39:59.580,00:40:00.770
OK.,00:40:07.830,00:40:09.340
"So to get bounds on
n factorial, we just",00:40:09.340,00:40:11.690
exponentiate both sides.,00:40:11.690,00:40:14.770
"So I take e to this,
gives me-- well, that's",00:40:14.770,00:40:18.300
going to give n to the n here.,00:40:18.300,00:40:23.205
And this is negative.,00:40:23.205,00:40:24.080
That'll be e to the n minus 1.,00:40:24.080,00:40:25.822
"And here I've got n plus
1 times the log of n.",00:40:29.690,00:40:34.170
"So it's n to the n plus
1 over the same thing--",00:40:34.170,00:40:38.680
e to the n minus 1.,00:40:38.680,00:40:41.710
So we got very close bounds.,00:40:41.710,00:40:43.160
"They're within a factor of
n-- which sounds like a lot,",00:40:43.160,00:40:46.570
"but compared to how big n
factorial is, not so bad.",00:40:46.570,00:40:50.450
Pretty good bounds there.,00:40:50.450,00:40:54.205
OK.,00:40:54.205,00:40:54.705
"So n factorial's about n
over e to the n'th power.",00:40:57.470,00:41:01.570
"Now this is so important
that-- even more important",00:41:01.570,00:41:05.180
"than harmonic numbers-- people
have gone to a lot of effort",00:41:05.180,00:41:08.060
"to get very tight
bounds on n factorial.",00:41:08.060,00:41:10.970
"So let me tell you
what those are.",00:41:10.970,00:41:12.386
It's called Stirling's formula.,00:41:19.754,00:41:21.045
"And that says that n
factorial equals n over e",00:41:30.510,00:41:35.650
"to the n'th power times the
square root of 2 pi n times",00:41:35.650,00:41:42.230
"e to the epsilon n where
epsilon n is between 1 over 12n",00:41:42.230,00:41:54.770
plus 1 and 1 over 12n.,00:41:54.770,00:42:00.670
"So it's epsilon n is
going to 0 as n gets big.",00:42:00.670,00:42:04.430
"So e to something going
to 0 is going to 1.",00:42:04.430,00:42:07.921
All right.,00:42:07.921,00:42:08.420
"So another way of
looking at this",00:42:08.420,00:42:11.000
"is you could put a
tilde here, all right,",00:42:11.000,00:42:13.270
and ignore that term.,00:42:13.270,00:42:14.490
"And that's called
Stirling's formula.",00:42:14.490,00:42:16.310
"This is a good thing to
have on your crib sheet",00:42:16.310,00:42:19.670
for the midterm.,00:42:19.670,00:42:21.110
"So very likely
there'll be something",00:42:21.110,00:42:23.040
"where you've got to have
some kind of analysis",00:42:23.040,00:42:25.700
"of n factorial, and to
know how fast it's growing.",00:42:25.700,00:42:31.370
"Now these bounds you
get here are very tight.",00:42:31.370,00:42:34.860
"For example, 100
factorial is at least 100",00:42:34.860,00:42:42.330
"over e to 100 times square
root 200 pi, times e to the 1",00:42:42.330,00:42:50.520
"over 1,201.",00:42:50.520,00:42:52.960
This thing is just really tiny.,00:42:52.960,00:42:54.880
"This thing here is
1.0008329 and something.",00:42:54.880,00:43:03.080
"And 100 factorial
is lower-bounded",00:43:03.080,00:43:06.710
"by the same things, only here
it's e to the 1 over 1,200.",00:43:06.710,00:43:15.040
"And that is very close
to 1-- 1.00083368.",00:43:15.040,00:43:24.100
"So the difference
in these bounds",00:43:24.100,00:43:26.850
is a tiny fraction of 1%.,00:43:26.850,00:43:30.770
"So the bound you get
from Stirling's formula",00:43:30.770,00:43:33.360
"is very, very close
to the right answer.",00:43:33.360,00:43:35.476
"Any questions on
Stirling's formula?",00:43:41.910,00:43:46.659
We won't derive it.,00:43:46.659,00:43:47.450
"You can derive that in
a graduate math class.",00:43:47.450,00:43:49.407
They do that sometimes.,00:43:49.407,00:43:50.365
"More typically you'll
see it without that e",00:43:53.380,00:43:55.615
to the error term.,00:43:55.615,00:43:56.940
"And you just see n
factorial written",00:43:56.940,00:43:58.540
"as tilde, and over e to
the n, square root 2 pi n.",00:43:58.540,00:44:05.930
All right?,00:44:05.930,00:44:06.430
"Because that e to the epsilon
n goes to 1 in the limit.",00:44:06.430,00:44:10.610
"So it sort of disappears when
you go to the tilde notation.",00:44:10.610,00:44:14.490
"And this in fact is
a lower bound on n",00:44:14.490,00:44:16.900
"factorial, and very close
to the right answer.",00:44:16.900,00:44:21.510
"Now this is sort of
an amazing formula.",00:44:21.510,00:44:25.010
"I mean who would think that
when you look at n factorial",00:44:25.010,00:44:29.010
"that the expression
would have e and pi",00:44:29.010,00:44:32.640
in the expression for it?,00:44:32.640,00:44:34.120
Maybe e.,00:44:34.120,00:44:34.930
Maybe.,00:44:34.930,00:44:35.640
"But what's pi doing
in n factorial?",00:44:35.640,00:44:39.330
It's sort of a bizarre thing.,00:44:39.330,00:44:43.410
OK.,00:44:43.410,00:44:44.470
That's it for products.,00:44:44.470,00:44:45.660
"We're just going to
do the one example,",00:44:45.660,00:44:47.285
"because really any product just
becomes a sum through the log.",00:44:47.285,00:44:50.530
And that makes it really easy.,00:44:50.530,00:44:52.590
"Any questions on
sums and products?",00:44:52.590,00:44:56.900
"Because I'm going to totally
change gears now and talk",00:44:56.900,00:45:00.940
about more things like tilde.,00:45:00.940,00:45:02.760
OK.,00:45:05.297,00:45:05.796
"So we're going to talk today
and tomorrow in recitation",00:45:10.170,00:45:15.340
about asymptotic notation.,00:45:15.340,00:45:18.690
"It is used all over the
place in computer science.",00:45:18.690,00:45:24.130
"We've already seen one example,
which is the tilde notation.",00:45:24.130,00:45:28.810
"And it turns out there's
five more things like that",00:45:28.810,00:45:33.150
"which we're going to learn what
they are and how they work.",00:45:33.150,00:45:35.911
"They're used to
explain or describe how",00:45:42.790,00:45:46.530
a function grows in the limit.,00:45:46.530,00:45:50.330
"So for example, we had
the tilde notation.",00:45:50.330,00:45:54.540
"And we wrote f of x is tilde
g of x if the limit as x goes",00:45:54.540,00:46:04.680
to infinity of f over g is 1.,00:46:04.680,00:46:11.223
"Now the next one--
and most commonly",00:46:13.880,00:46:16.280
"used one in computer
science-- is",00:46:16.280,00:46:17.910
"called the O notation,
or the big O.",00:46:17.910,00:46:23.200
And it's written like this.,00:46:23.200,00:46:24.760
f of x equals O of g of x.,00:46:24.760,00:46:31.100
"And it means that
the limit as x goes",00:46:31.100,00:46:37.100
"to infinity of the
absolute value of f",00:46:37.100,00:46:40.560
"of x over g of x
is convergence--",00:46:40.560,00:46:46.510
is less than infinity.,00:46:46.510,00:46:48.210
"So it's finite, and
it can't diverge.",00:46:48.210,00:46:55.760
"The interpretation
is that this function",00:46:55.760,00:47:00.730
"is up to constant factors
upper-bounded by this one,",00:47:00.730,00:47:05.860
"that this grows the same rate
or slower than this one grows",00:47:05.860,00:47:11.690
as x gets large.,00:47:11.690,00:47:13.880
"Because if f was growing a lot
faster than g in the limit,",00:47:13.880,00:47:18.450
"then the limit would be
the ratio is infinity.",00:47:18.450,00:47:20.520
"And we're saying
that doesn't happen.",00:47:20.520,00:47:22.521
All right.,00:47:22.521,00:47:23.020
"I'm not going to do a
lot of examples for this.",00:47:23.020,00:47:25.630
"In fact, let's go over here.",00:47:29.600,00:47:31.400
"There's several other ways
you'll see it written.",00:47:31.400,00:47:33.544
"For example, you'll
see people write",00:47:50.980,00:47:53.460
"f of x is less

"of g of x, because the
natural interpretation is",00:47:57.270,00:48:01.550
"f is not growing faster than
g-- sort of upper-bounded by g.",00:48:01.550,00:48:05.950
"You'll see people write
f of x is O of g of x.",00:48:05.950,00:48:13.060
"And the formal math way
that people don't use,",00:48:13.060,00:48:16.440
"but it's the
formally correct one,",00:48:16.440,00:48:18.590
"is f of x is an
element of O of g of x.",00:48:18.590,00:48:23.750
"And the interpretation
there is that O of g of x",00:48:23.750,00:48:26.890
"is a set of functions that
don't grow any faster than g.",00:48:26.890,00:48:29.950
And f is one of them.,00:48:29.950,00:48:31.810
"You can use any of
these and that's fine.",00:48:31.810,00:48:34.357
"People will know what
you mean, and it'll",00:48:34.357,00:48:36.065
be fine for the class.,00:48:36.065,00:48:38.560
All right.,00:48:38.560,00:48:39.060
"Let's see some examples, and see
how to prove a big O relation.",00:48:39.060,00:48:44.513
"Let f of x be the
function x, and g",00:48:47.300,00:48:51.480
of x be the function x squared.,00:48:51.480,00:48:55.670
"Then in this case
f of x is O of g",00:48:55.670,00:48:59.900
"of x-- because x doesn't
grow any faster than x",00:48:59.900,00:49:05.280
squared as x gets large.,00:49:05.280,00:49:06.940
"To prove it, we
take the limit as x",00:49:06.940,00:49:11.510
"goes to infinity of
x over x squared.",00:49:11.510,00:49:18.700
That is equal to what?,00:49:18.700,00:49:21.040
"What is the limit of x over x
squared as x goes to infinity?",00:49:21.040,00:49:25.920
0.,00:49:25.920,00:49:28.350
And that is less than infinity.,00:49:28.350,00:49:32.000
So we proved it.,00:49:32.000,00:49:33.960
"So if you get asked to prove
f is O of g, what you do",00:49:33.960,00:49:40.350
"is you take the limit of f
over g as x goes to infinity",00:49:40.350,00:49:44.860
"and show that it
doesn't diverge.",00:49:44.860,00:49:47.871
All right.,00:49:47.871,00:49:48.530
Let's do another example.,00:49:48.530,00:49:52.258
"In this case we'll show
that f is not O of g.",00:49:52.258,00:49:55.400
x squared is not O of x.,00:50:02.270,00:50:06.232
"Of course, x squared
grows faster than x,",00:50:06.232,00:50:08.360
but let's see why not.,00:50:08.360,00:50:09.783
"Well we take the limit
as x goes to infinity",00:50:12.670,00:50:16.010
of x squared over x.,00:50:16.010,00:50:21.130
And what is that limit?,00:50:21.130,00:50:23.920
Infinity.,00:50:23.920,00:50:25.870
"And so it can't be true
that it's x squared",00:50:25.870,00:50:28.360
"is O of x, because it has
to be less than infinity.",00:50:28.360,00:50:31.541
Yeah?,00:50:31.541,00:50:32.296
AUDIENCE: Sorry.,00:50:32.296,00:50:32.962
I missed it.,00:50:32.962,00:50:33.819
What's alpha?,00:50:33.819,00:50:34.360
PROFESSOR: Infinity.,00:50:37.227,00:50:38.060
Sorry.,00:50:41.180,00:50:41.770
Infinity.,00:50:41.770,00:50:42.050
There we go.,00:50:42.050,00:50:42.350
"That's important
in the definition.",00:50:42.350,00:50:43.808
Yep.,00:50:43.808,00:50:44.763
Good.,00:50:44.763,00:50:45.263
All right.,00:50:48.890,00:50:49.390
What about this?,00:50:49.390,00:50:52.190
"Is x squared equal O
of a million times x?",00:50:52.190,00:50:59.450
Yes?,00:51:04.750,00:51:05.630
No?,00:51:05.630,00:51:07.811
What do you think?,00:51:07.811,00:51:08.560
This looks pretty darn big.,00:51:12.100,00:51:14.166
AUDIENCE: It's a constant.,00:51:14.166,00:51:15.470
PROFESSOR: That a constant.,00:51:15.470,00:51:17.750
"So in the limit, as x goes
to infinity, this over that",00:51:17.750,00:51:23.670
is infinite.,00:51:23.670,00:51:25.541
All right.,00:51:25.541,00:51:26.040
So no.,00:51:26.040,00:51:28.720
"Because the limit of
x goes to infinity",00:51:28.720,00:51:32.250
"of x squared over 10 to the
sixth x, that equals infinity.",00:51:32.250,00:51:40.180
"So the thing with
this big O notation",00:51:40.180,00:51:43.300
"is you just ignore
our constant factors.",00:51:43.300,00:51:45.390
They don't do anything.,00:51:45.390,00:51:46.650
Just forget about them.,00:51:46.650,00:51:47.914
What about this?,00:51:51.690,00:51:52.690
"Is 10 to the sixth x
equal O of x squared?",00:51:52.690,00:51:59.828
Yes.,00:52:03.170,00:52:05.010
"Because you just
ignore the constant.",00:52:05.010,00:52:06.819
"That's what the big
O is for, and why",00:52:06.819,00:52:08.360
"it's used all the time
in computer science.",00:52:08.360,00:52:10.810
"So yes, that's true.",00:52:10.810,00:52:13.670
The proof is very simple.,00:52:13.670,00:52:16.260
"The limit as x goes to infinity
of 100 x squared-- whoops.",00:52:16.260,00:52:23.280
I could even put a square there.,00:52:23.280,00:52:25.110
"10 to the sixth x squared over
x squared is 10 to the sixth.",00:52:25.110,00:52:31.780
That's less than infinity.,00:52:31.780,00:52:33.080
"In fact, I could take
any quadratic polynomial.",00:52:37.000,00:52:40.380
"x squared plus 100x plus 10 to
the seventh is O of x squared.",00:52:40.380,00:52:47.410
"Because smaller order
terms don't matter.",00:52:49.970,00:52:52.140
"The limit of this here over
that in that case is 1.",00:52:52.140,00:52:56.880
"So it's less than
infinity as x gets big.",00:52:56.880,00:52:59.192
All right let's do a few more.,00:53:02.050,00:53:04.236
This really is not so hard.,00:53:09.200,00:53:10.660
It's a little dull.,00:53:10.660,00:53:12.770
"But you've got to
know it for later.",00:53:12.770,00:53:16.401
OK.,00:53:21.460,00:53:21.960
"I could take classes like
6046, and you'll never",00:53:21.960,00:53:24.740
"see any constants, because
everything is things like big O",00:53:24.740,00:53:28.040
"and the other notation
we'll talk about.",00:53:28.040,00:53:31.040
What about this?,00:53:31.040,00:53:32.050
"X to the 10th equal
O of e to the x.",00:53:32.050,00:53:37.490
Is x to the 10 O of e to the x?,00:53:40.720,00:53:43.175
"Yeah, it is.",00:53:46.390,00:53:48.740
So this is a theorem.,00:53:48.740,00:53:49.870
Proof.,00:53:53.250,00:53:55.240
Limit as x goes to infinity.,00:53:55.240,00:53:57.730
x to the 10 over e to the x.,00:53:57.730,00:54:00.680
"That equals 0, which is
certainly less than infinity.",00:54:00.680,00:54:03.185
All right.,00:54:05.810,00:54:06.310
"Now the reason this
stuff is useful",00:54:06.310,00:54:08.070
"when you're doing the
analysis of algorithms",00:54:08.070,00:54:11.310
"is because when you're
talking about things",00:54:11.310,00:54:13.590
"like matrix multiplication
algorithms or things like that,",00:54:13.590,00:54:17.410
"the actual running time
depends on the machine you're",00:54:17.410,00:54:20.580
"dealing with-- the machine
characteristics-- details",00:54:20.580,00:54:24.950
"in how you count steps
of the algorithm.",00:54:24.950,00:54:27.097
"For example, doing
matrix multiplication,",00:54:27.097,00:54:28.805
"do you count multiply different
than you count plus addition?",00:54:28.805,00:54:33.160
"And if you start getting
caught up in all those details",00:54:33.160,00:54:37.440
"you lose the important
fact of the algorithm.",00:54:37.440,00:54:39.880
"For example, matrix
multiplication--",00:54:39.880,00:54:41.440
"the elementary algorithm takes
order O of n cubed steps.",00:54:41.440,00:54:47.320
And that's the important fact.,00:54:47.320,00:54:48.930
"And it tells you that if you
double the size of the matrix",00:54:48.930,00:54:53.070
"the running time will increase
by at most a factor of eight",00:54:53.070,00:54:55.960
in the limit as n gets large.,00:54:55.960,00:54:58.890
"And so you might write
things like the time",00:54:58.890,00:55:03.300
to multiply n by n matrices.,00:55:03.300,00:55:08.450
"You might call that t of n,
and then state that is O of n",00:55:12.810,00:55:16.990
cubed.,00:55:16.990,00:55:19.390
All right.,00:55:19.390,00:55:19.890
"And you don't have to
worry about what computer",00:55:19.890,00:55:21.970
"it's running on,
exactly how you're",00:55:21.970,00:55:24.470
"counting the details of what
a step is or what time is.",00:55:24.470,00:55:27.580
"The important thing
is that it's growing",00:55:27.580,00:55:30.350
"at most as a cubic of
the size of the matrices.",00:55:30.350,00:55:35.490
"And so in 6046 and 6006
you will spend lots of time",00:55:35.490,00:55:41.730
"proving that things
are the running time,",00:55:41.730,00:55:44.040
"or the size is O of some
function of the input size.",00:55:44.040,00:55:50.313
All right.,00:55:50.313,00:55:50.812
Any questions?,00:55:53.780,00:55:55.340

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:55:55.845,00:55:56.720
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:56:05.484,00:56:06.150
"It gets all dicey if you
do oscillatory things.",00:56:06.150,00:56:08.580
"And it depends
how you define it.",00:56:08.580,00:56:10.350
"So we're going to
stay away from that",00:56:10.350,00:56:13.360
"and just stick with
this definition.",00:56:13.360,00:56:15.730
"So if this guy
oscillates-- like f",00:56:15.730,00:56:18.280
"is a sine of x,
sine of x is O of x.",00:56:18.280,00:56:21.660
All right.,00:56:21.660,00:56:22.160
It doesn't have to converge.,00:56:22.160,00:56:24.060
"But as long as the ratio
is less than infinity.",00:56:24.060,00:56:27.380

Everything you do.,00:56:30.110,00:56:31.500
"Maybe you'll see sine
functions sometimes.",00:56:31.500,00:56:33.250

PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:56:49.784,00:56:50.450
It's upper bounded.,00:56:50.450,00:56:52.006

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:57:04.949,00:57:05.824
"PROFESSOR: Ah, why is this true?",00:57:08.850,00:57:10.840
"Well technically we'd have
to go back to calculus",00:57:10.840,00:57:13.920
"and use L'Hopital's rule
or something like that,",00:57:13.920,00:57:16.510
"because this function
exponential grows a lot faster",00:57:16.510,00:57:20.520
than x to the tenth.,00:57:20.520,00:57:21.370
"So L'Hopital's rule is you
take the derivative of this",00:57:21.370,00:57:23.620
over the derivative of that.,00:57:23.620,00:57:24.900
"Then you'd have x to the
ninth over e to the x.",00:57:24.900,00:57:27.850
You do it nine more times.,00:57:27.850,00:57:29.780
"And you'd get 10
factorial over e to the x.",00:57:29.780,00:57:33.150
And that limit is zero.,00:57:33.150,00:57:35.000
"So that's how you'd actually
do it using L'Hopital's rule.",00:57:35.000,00:57:39.150
Yep.,00:57:39.150,00:57:40.240
"Any polynomial grows slower
than any exponential.",00:57:40.240,00:57:42.420

"Let's now do some examples
that can get you screwed up.",00:57:46.090,00:57:50.940
What about this one?,00:57:53.800,00:57:56.790
Is 4 to the x O to 2 to the x?,00:57:56.790,00:58:01.311
Is that true?,00:58:06.900,00:58:10.180
"No, it's not true.",00:58:10.180,00:58:11.830
"I mean, the mistake
you might make",00:58:11.830,00:58:13.710
"is say, oh, 4 and 2,
4 is only double 2.",00:58:13.710,00:58:16.940
"Big O wipes out
constant factors.",00:58:16.940,00:58:18.750
So the answer is yes.,00:58:18.750,00:58:20.360
That would be bad.,00:58:20.360,00:58:21.740
Better to look at the limit.,00:58:21.740,00:58:24.770
"So we'll state the correct
theorem-- 4 to the x",00:58:24.770,00:58:27.760
is not O of 2 to the x.,00:58:27.760,00:58:30.970
"And the proof is obtained
by looking at the limit",00:58:30.970,00:58:35.590
"as x goes to infinity of 4
to the x over 2 to the x.",00:58:35.590,00:58:40.060
"That is just the limit 4
to the x over 2 to the x",00:58:40.060,00:58:43.660
is 2 to the x.,00:58:43.660,00:58:45.000
That's infinity.,00:58:45.000,00:58:47.730
So the limit is not bounded.,00:58:47.730,00:58:49.556
All right?,00:58:49.556,00:58:50.510
So it is not big O there.,00:58:50.510,00:58:53.701
All right.,00:58:53.701,00:58:54.380
Here is one.,00:58:54.380,00:58:55.060
Is 10 O of 1?,00:58:57.770,00:59:00.270

written it this way.",00:59:05.230,00:59:08.790
"Yes, it is.",00:59:08.790,00:59:10.940
"And in fact the
interpretation here",00:59:10.940,00:59:13.770
"is that you've got
some function f",00:59:13.770,00:59:15.570
"of x that's just
always equal to 10,",00:59:15.570,00:59:18.310
"and some function g of x
that's always equal to 1.",00:59:18.310,00:59:22.550
"And then it is true in this
case that f of x is O of g of x.",00:59:22.550,00:59:26.070
All right.,00:59:28.851,00:59:29.350
"But any constant function is O
of any other constant function.",00:59:29.350,00:59:36.020
"We're going to revisit
this in a nastier",00:59:36.020,00:59:37.690
scenario in a little bit.,00:59:37.690,00:59:40.895
OK.,00:59:40.895,00:59:41.395
"Sometimes you'll see
notation like this.",00:59:45.490,00:59:50.670
"H of n-- in fact, we
saw this earlier--",00:59:50.670,00:59:53.890
"is the log of n plus
delta plus O of 1 over n.",00:59:53.890,01:00:00.770
"When we wrote out the formula
for the n'th harmonic number,",01:00:00.770,01:00:04.310
"it was log of n plus
Euler's constant plus",01:00:04.310,01:00:08.260
"something like 1 over n,
constant times 1 over n.",01:00:08.260,01:00:11.200
"And then some even
smaller terms.",01:00:11.200,01:00:13.750
"And so people will
write it like this.",01:00:13.750,01:00:15.390
"And it tells you that the
error terms grow no faster",01:00:15.390,01:00:19.840
than a constant times 1 over n.,01:00:19.840,01:00:22.260
"Technically this is the
wrong way to write it.",01:00:22.260,01:00:25.400
"But everybody does
it, so you can too.",01:00:25.400,01:00:29.260
What it means is this.,01:00:29.260,01:00:31.320
"H of n minus ln of n minus
delta is O of 1 over n.",01:00:31.320,01:00:36.881
All right.,01:00:36.881,01:00:37.380
"That's the correct
way to write it,",01:00:37.380,01:00:40.050
"because you're taking the
ratio of this over that.",01:00:40.050,01:00:43.790
This is how people will do it.,01:00:43.790,01:00:45.540
All right.,01:00:45.540,01:00:46.040
"So just make sure you
understand that, what it means",01:00:46.040,01:00:50.260
when you put it over there.,01:00:50.260,01:00:52.070
Same thing with tilde notation.,01:00:52.070,01:00:54.150
"People will write this-- H of
n is tilde ln of n plus Euler's",01:00:54.150,01:01:00.230
constant.,01:01:00.230,01:01:01.360

is Hn minus Euler's constant",01:01:01.360,01:01:05.360
is tilde ln of n.,01:01:05.360,01:01:08.720
"Now can anybody tell me
why this is really not",01:01:08.720,01:01:13.190
a good thing to do?,01:01:13.190,01:01:14.570
"And you think of how
things get really",01:01:14.570,01:01:16.320
"screwed up if you allow
to start doing this?",01:01:16.320,01:01:20.996
"Can you think of
anything that--?",01:01:20.996,01:01:22.370
What if I did this?,01:01:25.489,01:01:26.280
Is this true?,01:01:26.280,01:01:27.093
10.,01:01:31.431,01:01:31.930
"The n'th harmonic
is harmonic number",01:01:35.070,01:01:37.400
is tilde of log of n plus 10.,01:01:37.400,01:01:41.180
Is that true?,01:01:41.180,01:01:41.760
Think about that.,01:01:44.280,01:01:46.050
People are shaking their heads.,01:01:46.050,01:01:48.247
I mean how can it be true?,01:01:48.247,01:01:49.330
Because we know this is.,01:01:49.330,01:01:51.090
We know that's what it is.,01:01:51.090,01:01:53.700
"In fact, this is true.",01:01:53.700,01:01:55.730
I can even make it a million.,01:01:55.730,01:01:59.000
10 to the sixth here.,01:01:59.000,01:02:00.470
It's true.,01:02:00.470,01:02:02.530
"Because the ratio of this over
that in the limit is what?",01:02:02.530,01:02:08.560
1.,01:02:11.160,01:02:12.360
And that's all I need for tilde.,01:02:12.360,01:02:16.091
All right.,01:02:16.091,01:02:16.590
"So when I wrote this,
everybody knew what I meant.",01:02:16.590,01:02:21.730
"But I could write this and be
just as true mathematically.",01:02:21.730,01:02:24.960
"And so you've got to be
sort of careful about this.",01:02:24.960,01:02:27.640
"Really, the right
way to do it is this,",01:02:27.640,01:02:29.840
"because now we're
taking off that term,",01:02:29.840,01:02:31.880
"and then it's-- actually
I did this wrong.",01:02:31.880,01:02:33.820
I should've put the [INAUDIBLE].,01:02:33.820,01:02:34.860
Whoops.,01:02:34.860,01:02:35.200
I should've done it this way.,01:02:35.200,01:02:36.408
Let me rewrite that.,01:02:36.408,01:02:37.490
"The right way to do it is
H of n-- yeah-- is this.",01:02:37.490,01:02:40.710
"You put the small
term out over here.",01:02:40.710,01:02:42.560
That's the right way.,01:02:42.560,01:02:43.740
"Because now it's not true
that it's 10 to the sixth out",01:02:43.740,01:02:46.380
"here-- all right-- for the
ratio of that over this guy.",01:02:46.380,01:02:52.050
All right.,01:02:52.050,01:02:52.550
So you can do it.,01:02:52.550,01:02:53.740
"But be careful,
because you might",01:02:53.740,01:02:55.750
"write wrong things
that technically",01:02:55.750,01:02:57.790
would fit the definition.,01:02:57.790,01:02:59.400
"Same thing with big
O. Same problem there.",01:02:59.400,01:03:03.040
Any questions about that?,01:03:03.040,01:03:06.365
All right.,01:03:10.160,01:03:12.080
All right.,01:03:12.080,01:03:12.580
"Now one thing that people do all
the time that you cannot do is",01:03:12.580,01:03:17.780
to use big O as a lower bound.,01:03:17.780,01:03:20.132
All right.,01:03:22.760,01:03:23.370
"So that's one abuse that we
won't-- you'll get marked wrong",01:03:23.370,01:03:26.710
"for doing that, even though
famous researchers will do it,",01:03:26.710,01:03:31.380
"and you'll probably even have
a professor do it sometime.",01:03:31.380,01:03:33.754
So you may not do this.,01:03:37.280,01:03:39.760
"f of x is bigger than
or equal to O of g of x.",01:03:39.760,01:03:44.270
That is meaningless.,01:03:44.270,01:03:45.123
"Because the whole point of big
O is that it's an upper bound.",01:03:50.180,01:03:54.440
"So you can't use it
as a lower bound.",01:03:54.440,01:03:57.230
"And the reason
you can't do it is",01:03:57.230,01:03:58.670
"because there is another symbol
to do what you want to do.",01:03:58.670,01:04:03.820
"And that's called
the omega symbol.",01:04:03.820,01:04:07.960
And it's written like this.,01:04:07.960,01:04:09.495
It's a capital omega.,01:04:12.380,01:04:15.810
"And it's if the limit as x goes
to infinity of f of x over g",01:04:15.810,01:04:24.020
of x is greater than zero.,01:04:24.020,01:04:28.640
OK.,01:04:28.640,01:04:29.210
"So now we're getting
the lower bound version.",01:04:29.210,01:04:31.500
"In fact it's just the
opposite of big O.",01:04:31.500,01:04:37.355
"In fact, we'll state a theorem.",01:04:37.355,01:04:39.080
Not hard to prove.,01:04:39.080,01:04:40.060
We won't do it.,01:04:40.060,01:04:41.800
"f of x equals O of g of
x if and only if g of x",01:04:41.800,01:04:50.210
equals big omega of f of x.,01:04:50.210,01:04:54.120
"In other words, f
grows no faster than g",01:04:57.370,01:05:01.280
"if and only if g grows
at least as fast as f.",01:05:01.280,01:05:06.590
One's an upper bound one.,01:05:06.590,01:05:07.640
One's a lower bound.,01:05:07.640,01:05:09.010
"And you've just got to use
the symbol the right way.",01:05:09.010,01:05:11.430
Now you can do this.,01:05:11.430,01:05:13.070
"You can write f of x bigger
than or equal to omega g of x.",01:05:13.070,01:05:19.620
That's OK.,01:05:19.620,01:05:21.750
All right?,01:05:21.750,01:05:22.250
That's all right to do.,01:05:22.250,01:05:24.130
All right.,01:05:24.130,01:05:24.630
Let's do some examples.,01:05:24.630,01:05:25.588
"So x squared is omega of x,
because it grows faster than x.",01:05:29.910,01:05:36.360
"2 to the x is
omega of x squared.",01:05:36.360,01:05:39.910
All right.,01:05:54.200,01:05:55.960
"x over 100 is omega
of 100x plus 25,",01:05:55.960,01:06:06.260
because constants don't matter.,01:06:06.260,01:06:08.580
"x over 100 grows
at least as fast",01:06:08.580,01:06:10.970
"as 100x does in terms, because
we're measuring the growth.",01:06:10.970,01:06:14.940
So constants go away.,01:06:14.940,01:06:17.670
"If you want to say the
running time of that algorithm",01:06:17.670,01:06:20.830
"is at least quadratic,
you would write T of n",01:06:20.830,01:06:25.590
is omega n squared.,01:06:25.590,01:06:28.502
All right.,01:06:28.502,01:06:29.190
"And that says that the running
time is at least n squared.",01:06:29.190,01:06:33.310
Any questions on big omega?,01:06:33.310,01:06:37.570
"Not too hard once you have
big O. It's just the opposite.",01:06:37.570,01:06:42.380
"All right the next
symbol is the version",01:06:42.380,01:06:46.890
"of equality, where you're
bigger-- at least as big",01:06:46.890,01:06:49.020
"as, and at most as big as.",01:06:49.020,01:06:51.240
"There's a special
symbol for that.",01:06:51.240,01:06:55.180
So in that case we use theta.,01:06:55.180,01:06:56.585
"And we say that f
of x equals theta",01:07:02.160,01:07:06.210
"of g of x if the limit
is both bigger than 0",01:07:06.210,01:07:15.130
and less than infinity.,01:07:15.130,01:07:19.280
All right.,01:07:19.280,01:07:19.780
"So it's just a shorthand way
of saying big O and big omega.",01:07:19.780,01:07:24.400
That's what theta means.,01:07:24.400,01:07:25.400
It just both hold true.,01:07:25.400,01:07:28.720
All right.,01:07:28.720,01:07:29.220
"And that's a theorem which
is not hard to prove,",01:07:29.220,01:07:31.430
but we won't do it.,01:07:31.430,01:07:32.990
"f of x equals theta of g
of x if and only f of the x",01:07:32.990,01:07:41.280
"equals O of g of x and f
of x equals omega g of x.",01:07:41.280,01:07:49.770
All right.,01:07:53.130,01:07:53.650
"So let's do some
examples of theta.",01:07:53.650,01:07:55.845
"So for example, 10x cubed
minus 20x plus 1 is more easily",01:08:09.710,01:08:18.680
"written as theta of x cubed--
because the constants don't",01:08:18.680,01:08:24.340
matter.,01:08:24.340,01:08:24.840
"The low order
terms don't matter.",01:08:24.840,01:08:27.319
What about this?,01:08:27.319,01:08:28.859
"Is x over log of x,
is that theta of x?",01:08:28.859,01:08:34.460
x over log of x.,01:08:37.400,01:08:38.760
Is that theta of x?,01:08:38.760,01:08:41.500
People are nodding their heads.,01:08:41.500,01:08:44.979
Hmm.,01:08:44.979,01:08:46.880
Let's see.,01:08:46.880,01:08:47.750
Let's check.,01:08:47.750,01:08:48.319
"The limit as x goes to
infinity of x over log",01:08:51.859,01:08:57.560
of x divided by x.,01:08:57.560,01:09:01.660
"Well, the x's cancel.",01:09:01.660,01:09:02.920
"That's the limit as x goes to
infinity of 1 over log of x.",01:09:02.920,01:09:11.240
What's that?,01:09:11.240,01:09:13.399
0.,01:09:13.399,01:09:15.460
Uh-oh.,01:09:15.460,01:09:16.640
it is not theta.,01:09:16.640,01:09:18.830
I got to be bigger than zero.,01:09:18.830,01:09:22.300
"In fact, this grows
more slowly than that--",01:09:22.300,01:09:27.880
strictly more slowly.,01:09:27.880,01:09:30.250
All right.,01:09:30.250,01:09:31.930
"A little more slowly,
but strictly more slowly.",01:09:31.930,01:09:36.020
All right.,01:09:36.020,01:09:36.520
"If I use for an
algorithm, if you",01:09:36.520,01:09:39.729
"want to say the algorithm runs
in quadratic time-- namely",01:09:39.729,01:09:43.680
"at least quadratic time, and
at most quadratic time-- then",01:09:43.680,01:09:46.100
"you'd say t of n is
theta of n squared.",01:09:46.100,01:09:51.166
So let me write that.,01:09:51.166,01:09:52.292
"So t of n equals theta
n squared means t grows",01:09:55.190,01:10:04.560
"quadratically in n-- both
upper and lower bound.",01:10:04.560,01:10:14.094
OK?,01:10:14.094,01:10:15.056
"So for these three guys,
to summarize-- sort of you",01:10:15.056,01:10:27.690
"can keep track of them pretty
simply-- O means less than",01:10:27.690,01:10:39.070
or equal.,01:10:39.070,01:10:40.030
"Omega means greater
than or equal.",01:10:40.030,01:10:43.572
"Theta means equal up
to constant factors.",01:10:43.572,01:10:47.198
"Now there's two
more symbols here.",01:10:55.870,01:10:59.000
"And they correspond very
naturally to this set-up.",01:10:59.000,01:11:03.622
"What two symbols are missing
from here that would you",01:11:03.622,01:11:05.830
naturally add to here?,01:11:05.830,01:11:08.650
Yeah.,01:11:08.650,01:11:09.150
Less than and greater than.,01:11:09.150,01:11:11.130
So less than is little o.,01:11:11.130,01:11:15.620
Greater than is little omega.,01:11:15.620,01:11:19.430
"And less than means it's less
than or equal, but not equal.",01:11:19.430,01:11:24.710
"And this means greater
than or equal, not equal.",01:11:24.710,01:11:28.276
"And let me put them up
over here and give you",01:11:28.276,01:11:30.150
the formal definitions.,01:11:30.150,01:11:31.108
Eraser.,01:11:34.852,01:11:35.352
OK.,01:11:52.240,01:11:52.740
So little o.,01:11:52.740,01:11:55.120
"as we have f of x
equals little o of g",01:12:00.770,01:12:04.280
"x if the limit of f of
x over g of x equals 0.",01:12:04.280,01:12:18.310
"So f is growing
strictly smaller than g,",01:12:18.310,01:12:20.810
"so that when I take the
ratio, the limit goes to 0.",01:12:20.810,01:12:24.680
And the reverse is little omega.,01:12:24.680,01:12:26.477
"And we say that f of x is
little omega-- whoops--",01:12:30.860,01:12:35.880
of g of x if this is infinity.,01:12:35.880,01:12:42.770
"Because now f is growing
strictly faster than g,",01:12:42.770,01:12:46.430
"so I take the limit of the
ratio, and it goes to infinity.",01:12:46.430,01:12:51.110
"All right so we can do
some simple examples.",01:12:51.110,01:12:55.394
"Then we're almost done
with all this notation.",01:12:55.394,01:12:57.310
What about this one?,01:13:09.520,01:13:10.680
"x over ln of x-- we just
looked at it-- and x.",01:13:10.680,01:13:16.709
What symbol do I put there?,01:13:16.709,01:13:18.176
What symbol's missing here?,01:13:21.600,01:13:24.870
Little o.,01:13:24.870,01:13:26.060
"This grows strictly
smaller than that.",01:13:26.060,01:13:27.890
"If I took the ratio, and I
took the limit, we got 0.",01:13:27.890,01:13:31.390
So that's a little o.,01:13:31.390,01:13:33.510
OK.,01:13:33.510,01:13:35.810
Is this true?,01:13:35.810,01:13:37.340
"x over 100-- is
that little o of x?",01:13:37.340,01:13:40.427
No.,01:13:44.050,01:13:46.410
"The limit of the
ratio is 1 over 100.",01:13:46.410,01:13:48.520
That's bigger than 0.,01:13:48.520,01:13:49.590
Constants don't matter.,01:13:49.590,01:13:51.270
All right.,01:13:51.270,01:13:51.770
So what symbol would go here?,01:13:51.770,01:13:54.530
Theta goes here.,01:13:54.530,01:13:56.060
Good.,01:13:56.060,01:13:56.960
Also big O and big omega.,01:13:56.960,01:13:58.310
But theta captures everything.,01:13:58.310,01:14:01.311
All right.,01:14:01.311,01:14:01.810
What symbol goes here?,01:14:01.810,01:14:03.990
x squared equals something x.,01:14:03.990,01:14:08.330
What symbol goes there?,01:14:08.330,01:14:11.660
Little omega.,01:14:11.660,01:14:12.635
"It would also be true
to put big omega,",01:14:12.635,01:14:14.260
but little omega tells you more.,01:14:14.260,01:14:16.320
"Because the limit of x squared
over x goes to infinity.",01:14:16.320,01:14:21.021
OK.,01:14:21.021,01:14:21.520
"Any questions
about these things?",01:14:21.520,01:14:24.760
"So a natural thing on the
midterm is we do some of that,",01:14:24.760,01:14:28.690
for example.,01:14:28.690,01:14:29.710
All right?,01:14:29.710,01:14:30.410
"And you'll certainly see
some of that on homework.",01:14:30.410,01:14:33.040
"You might see some
of that on the test.",01:14:33.040,01:14:35.520
"You'll certainly see all
this stuff-- little omega",01:14:35.520,01:14:37.690
"not very often in 6046 and
later algorithms courses.",01:14:37.690,01:14:41.020
"But all the rest
you'll see there.",01:14:41.020,01:14:43.970
Any questions?,01:14:43.970,01:14:46.230
All right.,01:14:46.230,01:14:46.860
"Now I'm going to
show you something",01:14:46.860,01:14:49.760
that is sort of scary.,01:14:49.760,01:14:52.020
Yeah.,01:14:52.020,01:14:52.562
"AUDIENCE: Why do
you say that it's",01:14:52.562,01:14:53.978
"equal to zero when
you said it's less",01:14:53.978,01:14:55.671
than [INAUDIBLE] equals sign.,01:14:55.671,01:15:01.450
PROFESSOR: Which equals?,01:15:01.450,01:15:02.820
"AUDIENCE: You said little
omega is less than.",01:15:02.820,01:15:05.580
"PROFESSOR: Little omega,
it corresponds to a greater",01:15:05.580,01:15:08.296
"than, which means a
greater than or equal to,",01:15:08.296,01:15:11.650
but not an equal to.,01:15:11.650,01:15:14.840
"And the way we can see that
is looking at the definitions",01:15:14.840,01:15:17.510
"here in the greater than or
equal to is the big omega.",01:15:17.510,01:15:25.705
"And that just says
you're bigger than 0.",01:15:25.705,01:15:31.850
Ah.,01:15:31.850,01:15:32.350
Let's see.,01:15:32.350,01:15:33.280
All right.,01:15:33.280,01:15:35.350
"So I'm bigger than
or equal to is omega.",01:15:35.350,01:15:37.680
"But I'm not equal
to, which is theta.",01:15:37.680,01:15:42.970
"So if I know that I'm
this but not that,",01:15:42.970,01:15:46.940
"the only conclusion is that
I'm infinity in the ratio.",01:15:46.940,01:15:51.460
All right?,01:15:51.460,01:15:51.960
"So that's another
way of saying it.",01:15:51.960,01:15:53.890
That's why.,01:15:53.890,01:15:55.940
Any other questions?,01:15:55.940,01:15:56.922
All right.,01:16:00.090,01:16:00.590
"Now I'm going to
show you something",01:16:00.590,01:16:02.048
"that is commonly done, and
that many students will attempt",01:16:02.048,01:16:05.420
"to do after seeing
this notation,",01:16:05.420,01:16:07.137
"because the notation
is pretty simple.",01:16:07.137,01:16:08.720
Take your limits.,01:16:08.720,01:16:09.428
Everything goes fine.,01:16:09.428,01:16:10.900
"Then you start
cruising along with it.",01:16:10.900,01:16:13.290
"So now I'm going to show
you how to prove something",01:16:13.290,01:16:15.490
"that's false using this notation
in a way that people often do.",01:16:15.490,01:16:21.770
"And the hope is by showing
you, you won't do it.",01:16:21.770,01:16:26.700
"It will confuse you,
which is why sometimes we",01:16:26.700,01:16:31.090
worry about showing you.,01:16:31.090,01:16:32.480
"But let f of i-- f of n-- equal
the sum i equals 1 to n of i.",01:16:32.480,01:16:48.420
"Now we all know
what that is, right?",01:16:48.420,01:16:51.600
All right.,01:16:51.600,01:16:52.700
"So I'm going to prove to
you that f of n is O of n.",01:16:52.700,01:16:59.456
"Now what really-- what
should be here instead of n?",01:17:02.310,01:17:06.460
n squared.,01:17:06.460,01:17:07.980
So n squared can't be O of n.,01:17:07.980,01:17:10.090
So this can't be true.,01:17:10.090,01:17:12.000
All right.,01:17:12.000,01:17:12.500
Well let's see how we do it.,01:17:12.500,01:17:15.130
All right.,01:17:17.570,01:17:18.070
"So the false proof
is by induction on n.",01:17:18.070,01:17:31.280
"My induction hypothesis is p
of n is going to be that f of n",01:17:31.280,01:17:39.820
is O of n.,01:17:39.820,01:17:41.910
All right?,01:17:41.910,01:17:42.410
"That's what we, when we want to
prove something by induction,",01:17:42.410,01:17:45.020
typically that's what you do.,01:17:45.020,01:17:46.480
"Becomes the
induction hypothesis.",01:17:46.480,01:17:49.365
Let's look at the base case.,01:17:49.365,01:17:50.531
"Well f of 1 is 1, and
1 is O of 1 surely.",01:17:54.690,01:18:03.012
Right?,01:18:03.012,01:18:03.850
Even 10 was O of 1.,01:18:03.850,01:18:06.990
OK.,01:18:06.990,01:18:07.490
All right.,01:18:19.420,01:18:19.920
Now we do the inductive step.,01:18:19.920,01:18:21.426
"We assume p n is true to
prove that p n plus 1 is true.",01:18:28.030,01:18:36.405
"Well p n means that
f of n is O of n.",01:18:39.260,01:18:46.850
Now I look at f of n plus 1.,01:18:46.850,01:18:49.980
"That equals the sum of
the first n plus 1 number.",01:18:49.980,01:18:53.630
"So that will be f
of n plus n plus 1.",01:18:53.630,01:18:59.640
"The induction hypothesis
says this is O of n.",01:18:59.640,01:19:04.000
Clearly this is O of n.,01:19:04.000,01:19:05.620
Well I got O of n plus O of n.,01:19:08.720,01:19:10.830
That's at most twice O of n.,01:19:10.830,01:19:12.385
And constants don't matter.,01:19:16.490,01:19:18.630
So that's O of n.,01:19:18.630,01:19:20.121
All right.,01:19:26.020,01:19:26.520
"This should begin
to cause panic.",01:19:26.520,01:19:31.680
Is induction wrong?,01:19:31.680,01:19:32.900
What's going on with the big O?,01:19:32.900,01:19:35.520
"You will see this
done all the time.",01:19:35.520,01:19:37.350
"People would do this
kind of an argument.",01:19:37.350,01:19:40.990
"Looks pretty good, right?",01:19:40.990,01:19:44.430
"Can anybody see where
I got off track?",01:19:44.430,01:19:48.356
"This is a really hard
one to figure out",01:19:48.356,01:19:49.980
where things went wrong.,01:19:49.980,01:19:51.310
Yeah?,01:19:51.310,01:19:52.254
"AUDIENCE: One of them
might be that you",01:19:52.254,01:19:53.906
"might be applying O of n
to numbers which really you",01:19:53.906,01:20:00.458
"really apply asymptotic
notation to functions.",01:20:00.458,01:20:05.040
PROFESSOR: Great.,01:20:05.040,01:20:06.390
That's a great observation.,01:20:06.390,01:20:08.060
"Asymptotic notation only
works for functions.",01:20:08.060,01:20:11.700
"Now here when we
say 1 is O of 1,",01:20:11.700,01:20:15.460
"well, you could think of it as
f of x being 1-- the function--",01:20:15.460,01:20:19.600
and so forth.,01:20:19.600,01:20:20.240
So that's OK.,01:20:20.240,01:20:21.480
That's a great point.,01:20:21.480,01:20:22.730
"Now let's figure out using
that how we got in trouble.",01:20:22.730,01:20:26.999
We're not quite done yet.,01:20:26.999,01:20:28.040
That's a great observation.,01:20:28.040,01:20:29.670
"But where's the
step that's wrong?",01:20:29.670,01:20:32.160
"Oh, no.",01:20:35.870,01:20:36.590
2 times O of n is O of n.,01:20:36.590,01:20:38.750
"If I have a function that's f
is O of g, twice f is O of g.",01:20:38.750,01:20:43.190
Yeah?,01:20:43.190,01:20:44.078
"AUDIENCE: It's the end of
n equals 1 [INAUDIBLE].",01:20:44.078,01:20:47.752
PROFESSOR: Is it?,01:20:47.752,01:20:48.460
So what's the problem now?,01:20:48.460,01:20:50.371
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],01:20:50.371,01:20:52.830
"PROFESSOR: Well f of n plus
1-- this statement is true,",01:20:52.830,01:20:56.100
"because f of n plus 1 is the sum
of i equals 1 to n plus 1 of i.",01:20:56.100,01:21:03.400
"That's 1 plus 2 plus
n plus n plus 1.",01:21:03.400,01:21:07.360
And this is f of n.,01:21:07.360,01:21:10.630
So that's OK.,01:21:10.630,01:21:11.532
Yeah.,01:21:19.010,01:21:19.970
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that function.",01:21:19.970,01:21:24.404
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,01:21:24.404,01:21:25.070
"You know, you're getting closer.",01:21:25.070,01:21:28.820
"Yeah that's a little
flaky, because I've just",01:21:28.820,01:21:32.740
"got a single value
saying it's O of one.",01:21:32.740,01:21:34.950
"But we sort of argued
before that 10 was O of 1.",01:21:34.950,01:21:38.120
"Now realize a function
behind here that matters.",01:21:38.120,01:21:40.762
So you're on the right trail.,01:21:40.762,01:21:41.970
"But there's an even
bigger whopper hiding.",01:21:41.970,01:21:44.160
Yeah.,01:21:44.160,01:21:44.984
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],01:21:44.984,01:21:46.159
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.,01:21:46.159,01:21:46.950
"This is really, really bad.",01:21:46.950,01:21:51.130
All right.,01:21:51.130,01:21:52.520
"So now explain to me why this
is really bad what I did here.",01:21:52.520,01:21:56.770
"AUDIENCE: You didn't need
the function [INAUDIBLE].",01:21:56.770,01:21:59.904
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,01:21:59.904,01:22:00.570
"And why isn't-- this
looks like a function.",01:22:00.570,01:22:02.840
Why isn't it a function?,01:22:02.840,01:22:03.938
It's not.,01:22:07.010,01:22:07.740
But it looks like one.,01:22:07.740,01:22:09.450
f of n sure looks like one.,01:22:09.450,01:22:10.760
"Why is it not a function when
it's sitting in this thing?",01:22:10.760,01:22:14.128
"This P of n, right?",01:22:16.870,01:22:19.730
"Because I've fixed
the value of n here.",01:22:19.730,01:22:23.350
"And so this is
now just a scalar.",01:22:23.350,01:22:25.870
"In fact, you know, I could state
the following-- f of a million,",01:22:25.870,01:22:34.020
"right, is O of 1, because
this is really some function H",01:22:34.020,01:22:38.930
of x that always is this value.,01:22:38.930,01:22:41.930
"So the difference between
a scalar and a function.",01:22:41.930,01:22:44.470
"And this is just so nasty
looking, because we see f of n.",01:22:44.470,01:22:47.710
That's a function.,01:22:47.710,01:22:49.140
"But you can never use
big O in a predicate,",01:22:49.140,01:22:54.991
"all right, because we've
lost the function here.",01:22:54.991,01:22:56.990
"This is just f
valued at n period.",01:22:56.990,01:23:00.690
"That single instance is
all that's happened here.",01:23:00.690,01:23:03.430
It's not a function anymore.,01:23:03.430,01:23:05.910
All right.,01:23:05.910,01:23:06.790
"If we had f n of x or
something, that might be OK.",01:23:06.790,01:23:09.480
But there's no function left.,01:23:09.480,01:23:11.540
All right.,01:23:11.540,01:23:12.040
"So never ever use asymptotic
notation with inductive proofs,",01:23:12.040,01:23:17.670
"because you will
just invariably stick",01:23:17.670,01:23:20.240
big O into your predicate.,01:23:20.240,01:23:23.150
"And you could prove all sorts of
false things once you do that.",01:23:23.150,01:23:27.190
OK?,01:23:27.190,01:23:29.590
All right.,01:23:29.590,01:23:30.150
"Never use asymptotic notation
in induction or predicates.",01:23:30.150,01:23:33.400
Thanks.,01:23:33.400,01:23:34.950
