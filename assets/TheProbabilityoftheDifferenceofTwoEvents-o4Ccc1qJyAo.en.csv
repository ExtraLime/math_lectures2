Hi.,00:00:01.390,00:00:02.400
"In this problem, we're going to
use the set of probability",00:00:02.400,00:00:05.140
"axioms to derive the probability
of the difference",00:00:05.140,00:00:07.830
of two events.,00:00:07.830,00:00:09.170
"Now, before we get started,
there's one thing you might",00:00:09.170,00:00:11.430
"notice that, the equation
we're trying to prove is",00:00:11.430,00:00:13.730
actually quite complicated.,00:00:13.730,00:00:15.340
"And I don't like it either, so
the first thing we're going to",00:00:15.340,00:00:17.730
"do will be to find a simpler
notation for the events that",00:00:17.730,00:00:21.930
we're interested in.,00:00:21.930,00:00:23.180
 ,00:00:23.180,00:00:26.180
"So we start with two events, A
and B, and there might be some",00:00:26.180,00:00:29.780
"intersection between
the two events.",00:00:29.780,00:00:31.720
"We'll label the set of points
or samples in A that are not",00:00:31.720,00:00:36.460
"in B, as a set C. So C will be
A intersection B complement.",00:00:36.460,00:00:45.800
"Similarly, for all points that
are in B but not in A, this",00:00:45.800,00:00:51.680
"area, we'll call it D.",00:00:51.680,00:00:54.770
"And D will be the set A
complement intersection B. And",00:00:54.770,00:01:01.310
"finally, for points that are in
the intersection of A and",00:01:01.310,00:01:06.130
"B, we'll call it E. So E is A
intersection B. And for the",00:01:06.130,00:01:13.540
"rest of our problem, we're going
to be using the notation",00:01:13.540,00:01:15.830
"C, D, and E instead of
whatever's down below.",00:01:15.830,00:01:21.990
"If we use this notation, we can
rewrite our objective as",00:01:21.990,00:01:26.010
the following.,00:01:26.010,00:01:27.790
"We want to show that the
probability of C union D is",00:01:27.790,00:01:34.220
"equal to the probability
of the event A plus the",00:01:34.220,00:01:38.210
"probability of B minus twice the
probability of E. And that",00:01:38.210,00:01:46.760
"will be our goal for
the problem.",00:01:46.760,00:01:48.010
 ,00:01:48.010,00:01:51.140
"Now, let's take a minute to
review what the axioms are,",00:01:51.140,00:01:54.110
"what the probability
axioms are.",00:01:54.110,00:01:56.310
"The first one says
non-negativity.",00:01:56.310,00:01:59.000
"We take any event A, then
the probability of A",00:01:59.000,00:02:01.870
must be at least 0.,00:02:01.870,00:02:04.150
"The second normalization says
the probability of the entire",00:02:04.150,00:02:07.910
"space, the entire sample space
omega, must be equal to 1.",00:02:07.910,00:02:12.420
"And finally, the additivity
axiom, which will be the axiom",00:02:12.420,00:02:16.610
"that we're going to use for this
problem says, if there",00:02:16.610,00:02:19.550
"are two events, A and B
that are disjoint--",00:02:19.550,00:02:23.780
"which means they don't have
anything in common, therefore.",00:02:23.780,00:02:26.765
"the intersection is
the empty set.",00:02:26.765,00:02:29.340
"Then the probability of their
union will be equal to the",00:02:29.340,00:02:32.870
"probably A plus the probability
of B. For the rest",00:02:32.870,00:02:37.610
"of the problem, I will refer
to this axiom as add.",00:02:37.610,00:02:41.090
"So whenever we invoke this
axiom, I'll write",00:02:41.090,00:02:44.610
"""add"" on the board.",00:02:44.610,00:02:47.010
Let's get started.,00:02:47.010,00:02:48.510
"First, we'll invoke the
additivity axioms to argue",00:02:48.510,00:02:52.950
"that the probability of C union
D is simply the sum of",00:02:52.950,00:02:58.470
"probability of C plus
probability of",00:02:58.470,00:03:01.680
D. Why is this true?,00:03:01.680,00:03:04.780
"We can apply this axiom, because
the set C here and the",00:03:04.780,00:03:09.610
"set D here, they're completely
disjoint from each other.",00:03:09.610,00:03:14.410
"And in a similar way, we'll
also notice the following.",00:03:14.410,00:03:20.400
"We see that A is equal to the
union of the set C and E.",00:03:20.400,00:03:30.390
"And also, C and E, they're
disjoint with each other,",00:03:30.390,00:03:36.020
"because C and E by definition
don't share any points.",00:03:36.020,00:03:39.970
"And therefore, we have probably
A is equal to",00:03:39.970,00:03:44.440
"probability of C plus the
probability of E. Now, in a",00:03:44.440,00:03:51.760
"similar way, the probability of
event B can also be written",00:03:51.760,00:03:57.620
"as a probability of D plus the
probability of E, because",00:03:57.620,00:04:03.890
"event B is the union
of D and E.",00:04:03.890,00:04:07.480
"And D and E are disjoint
from each other.",00:04:07.480,00:04:10.240
"So we again invoke the
additivity axiom.",00:04:10.240,00:04:14.150
"Now, this should be enough
to prove our final claim.",00:04:14.150,00:04:18.529
"We have the probability of C
union D. By the very first",00:04:18.529,00:04:25.660
"line, we see this is simply
probability of C plus the",00:04:25.660,00:04:29.810
probability of D.,00:04:29.810,00:04:33.690
"Now, I'm going to insert two
terms here to make the",00:04:33.690,00:04:36.620
"connection with a second part of
the equation more obvious.",00:04:36.620,00:04:40.920
"That is, I will write
probability C plus probability",00:04:40.920,00:04:48.990
"E plus probability D plus
probability of E. Now, I've",00:04:48.990,00:04:57.290
just added two terms here--,00:04:57.290,00:04:59.810
"probability E. So to make the
equality valid or subtract it",00:04:59.810,00:05:04.960
"out two times, the
probability of E.",00:05:04.960,00:05:10.100
Hence this equality is valid.,00:05:10.100,00:05:13.510
"So if we look at this equation,
we see that there",00:05:13.510,00:05:17.370
"are two parts here that
we've already seen",00:05:17.370,00:05:20.260
before right here.,00:05:20.260,00:05:22.810
"The very first parenthesis is
equal to the probability of A.",00:05:22.810,00:05:30.570
"And the value of the second
parenthesis is equal to the",00:05:30.570,00:05:34.690
"probability of B. We just
derived these here.",00:05:34.690,00:05:39.750
"And finally, we have the minus
2 probability of E. This line",00:05:39.750,00:05:47.730
"plus this line gives us
the final equation.",00:05:47.730,00:05:51.450
"And that will be the answer
for the problem.",00:05:51.450,00:05:53.610
 ,00:05:53.610,00:05:54.860
