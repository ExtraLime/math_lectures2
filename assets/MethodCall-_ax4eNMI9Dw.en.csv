"ANA BELL: This is my
definition, including the method",00:00:23.710,00:00:27.790
"to paint the car, so
to change its color.",00:00:27.790,00:00:31.570
"And the question says you create
a car with this line here.",00:00:31.570,00:00:35.350
"So you're initializing
it with 4 comma 2.",00:00:35.350,00:00:37.780
"What's a line of code that
changes the color from whatever",00:00:37.780,00:00:41.050
it initially is to red?,00:00:41.050,00:00:44.600
"The first one,
car.paintred, is sort",00:00:44.600,00:00:47.540
"of attempting to
do the way that we",00:00:47.540,00:00:50.270
"saw in the right
in the slides where",00:00:50.270,00:00:51.770
you calling the class name dot.,00:00:51.770,00:00:53.930
But it's missing the self.,00:00:53.930,00:00:55.220
"So we don't know what
object to call it on.",00:00:55.220,00:00:57.290
"So that one's out
of the running.",00:00:57.290,00:00:59.720
"The second one is closer,
but we have red here as",00:00:59.720,00:01:03.440
"a variable as
opposed to a string.",00:01:03.440,00:01:06.640
So that one's not going to work.,00:01:06.640,00:01:09.040
The third one looks good.,00:01:09.040,00:01:11.140
"And the fourth
one is just weird.",00:01:11.140,00:01:14.390
"I don't think that
one will work.",00:01:14.390,00:01:16.240
"It's attempting to
put a value for self.",00:01:16.240,00:01:18.250
"But you've already called mycar
dot instead of the class name",00:01:18.250,00:01:25.500
dot.,00:01:25.500,00:01:26.410
"So here, this isn't
going to work.",00:01:26.410,00:01:31.160
"So since you already called the
object name dot method name,",00:01:31.160,00:01:38.162
"you just have to give it the
other parameter that it needs,",00:01:38.162,00:01:40.620
which is the color.,00:01:40.620,00:01:42.370
"I think the majority
have gotten it right.",00:01:42.370,00:01:45.497
