"Vasily Strela who works
now for Morgan Stanley,",00:00:16.530,00:00:21.970
"did his PhD here in the math
department, and kindly said he",00:00:21.970,00:00:27.000
"would tell us about
financial mathematics.",00:00:27.000,00:00:30.610
"So, it's all yours.",00:00:30.610,00:00:32.730
"GUEST SPEAKER: Let me
thank Professor Strang",00:00:36.450,00:00:38.750
"for giving this
opportunity to talk here,",00:00:38.750,00:00:41.020
"and it feels very good to
be back, be back to 18.086.",00:00:41.020,00:00:46.930
"So, a few more
words about myself.",00:00:46.930,00:00:50.420
"I've been Professor Strang's
student in mathematics",00:00:50.420,00:00:54.100
about ten years ago.,00:00:54.100,00:00:56.060
"So after receiving my
PhD, I taught mathematics",00:00:56.060,00:01:00.760
for a few years.,00:01:00.760,00:01:02.870
"Then ended up working for
a financial institution,",00:01:02.870,00:01:07.400
"for investment bank, Morgan
Stanley in particular.",00:01:07.400,00:01:11.660
"I'm part of an analytic modeling
group in fixed income division.",00:01:11.660,00:01:17.950
"What we are doing, we are
doing math applications",00:01:17.950,00:01:22.740
"in finance and modeling
derivatives, fixed income",00:01:22.740,00:01:26.910
derivatives.,00:01:26.910,00:01:28.970
"That's actually what I'm
going to talk about today.",00:01:28.970,00:01:31.530
"I want to show how 18.086,
it's a wonderful class",00:01:31.530,00:01:36.390
"which I admire a lot,
which applications",00:01:36.390,00:01:41.080
"it has in the real world,
and in particular in finance",00:01:41.080,00:01:44.720
and derivatives pricing.,00:01:44.720,00:01:47.650
"Let's start with
a simple example,",00:01:47.650,00:01:50.870
"which actually comes not
from finance, but rather",00:01:50.870,00:01:54.140
from gambling.,00:01:54.140,00:01:57.050
"Well, let's look at
horse racing or cockroach",00:01:57.050,00:02:03.020
"racing, if you prefer.",00:02:03.020,00:02:06.180
"Suppose there are two
horses, and sure enough,",00:02:06.180,00:02:09.520
"people bet on them and
bookie is a clever one, very",00:02:09.520,00:02:14.190
"scientific-minded
guy and he made",00:02:14.190,00:02:16.700
"a very good research of previous
history of these two horses.",00:02:16.700,00:02:22.840
"He found out that the first
horse has 20% chance to win.",00:02:22.840,00:02:28.980
"The second horse has
80% chance to win.",00:02:28.980,00:02:32.660
"He is actually right about his
knowledge about chances to win.",00:02:32.660,00:02:38.250
"On the other hand, general
public, people who bet,",00:02:38.250,00:02:41.250
"they don't have access
to all information,",00:02:41.250,00:02:44.500
"and the bets are split
slightly differently.",00:02:44.500,00:02:46.870
"So 10,000 is placed
on the first horse,",00:02:46.870,00:02:53.390
"and 50,000 is placed
on the second horse.",00:02:53.390,00:02:57.970
"Bookie, sticking to his
scientific knowledge,",00:02:57.970,00:03:01.650
"splits the odds 4 to 1, meaning
that if the first horse wins,",00:03:01.650,00:03:06.560
"then whoever put on the
horse gets his money back",00:03:06.560,00:03:09.950
"and four times his
money back on top of it.",00:03:09.950,00:03:13.370
"Or if the second horse wins then
whoever put money on this horse",00:03:13.370,00:03:17.950
"will get the money back
and 1/4 on top of it.",00:03:17.950,00:03:24.190
"So, let's see.",00:03:24.190,00:03:26.360
"What are chances for bookie to
win or lose in this situation?",00:03:26.360,00:03:34.460
"Well, if the first
horse wins then he",00:03:34.460,00:03:36.510
"has to give back 10,000
plus 40,000, 50,000,",00:03:36.510,00:03:41.530
"and he got 60,000,
so he gains 10,000.",00:03:41.530,00:03:46.500
"Well, good, good for him.",00:03:46.500,00:03:48.450
"On the other hand, if
the second horse wins,",00:03:48.450,00:03:51.080
"then he has to give back
50,000 plus 1/4 of 50,",00:03:51.080,00:03:56.400
"which is 12,500, so
62.50 altogether,",00:03:56.400,00:04:05.360
"and he loses $2,500.",00:04:05.360,00:04:10.210
"After many runs, the expected
win or loss of the bookmaker",00:04:10.210,00:04:15.320
"is the probability
of the first horse",00:04:15.320,00:04:17.460
"to win times the expected
win, plus the probability",00:04:17.460,00:04:20.300
"of second horse to win times the
expected loss, which turns out",00:04:20.300,00:04:23.830
to be exactly zero.,00:04:23.830,00:04:25.770
"So in each particular run,
bookie may lose or win,",00:04:25.770,00:04:31.450
"but in the long run he
expects to break even.",00:04:31.450,00:04:38.390
"On the other hand, if he
would put the chances,",00:04:38.390,00:04:41.640
"he would set the odds according
to the money bet, 5 to 1.",00:04:41.640,00:04:47.230
what would be the outcome?,00:04:47.230,00:04:48.790
"Well, if the first horse wins he
gives back 10,000 plus 50,000,",00:04:48.790,00:04:54.960
"60,000, exactly the
amount he collected.",00:04:54.960,00:05:00.820
"Or if the second
horse wins, again, he",00:05:00.820,00:05:04.680
"gives back 50 plus 1/5 of
that, 60, he breaks even.",00:05:04.680,00:05:09.390
"So no matter which horse
wins in this scenario,",00:05:09.390,00:05:14.010
the bookie breaks even.,00:05:14.010,00:05:15.890
"How bookie operates,
well he actually",00:05:15.890,00:05:18.560
"charges a fee for
each bet, right.",00:05:18.560,00:05:21.070
"So the second situation is
much more preferable for him.",00:05:21.070,00:05:25.200
"When he doesn't care which horse
wins, he just collects the fee.",00:05:25.200,00:05:30.520
"Well here, he may
lose or gain money.",00:05:30.520,00:05:33.830
"This is quite
beautiful observation,",00:05:33.830,00:05:37.240
"which we will see how
it works in derivatives.",00:05:37.240,00:05:43.360
"So now back to finance,
back to derivatives.",00:05:43.360,00:05:47.240
"So we are actually
interested in pricing",00:05:47.240,00:05:49.970
"a few financial derivatives, and
what is a financial derivative?",00:05:49.970,00:05:52.880
"Well, a financial
derivative is a contract,",00:05:52.880,00:05:56.180
"payoff of which at
maturity, at some time T,",00:05:56.180,00:05:59.980
"depends on underlying
security -- in our case,",00:05:59.980,00:06:04.920
"we always we will be talking
about a stock as underlying",00:06:04.920,00:06:07.710
"security, and probably
interest rates.",00:06:07.710,00:06:13.250
"What are the examples of
financial derivatives?",00:06:13.250,00:06:17.500
"Well, the most simple example
is probably a forward contract.",00:06:17.500,00:06:22.090
"Forward contracts is a contract
when you agree to purchase",00:06:22.090,00:06:26.810
"the security for a price
which is set today --",00:06:26.810,00:06:30.960
"you've agreed to purchase
the security in the future",00:06:30.960,00:06:33.740
for the price agreed today.,00:06:33.740,00:06:35.890
"Well, for example, if you needed
1,000 barrel of oil to heat",00:06:35.890,00:06:42.230
"your house, but not today, but
rather for the next winter,",00:06:42.230,00:06:47.165
"on the other hand,
you don't want",00:06:47.165,00:06:48.540
"to take the risks of waiting
until the next winter",00:06:48.540,00:06:52.700
"and buying oil then, you would
rather agree on the price",00:06:52.700,00:06:57.670
"now and pay it in the
future and get the oil.",00:06:57.670,00:07:03.880
What the price should be?,00:07:03.880,00:07:05.300
"What is the fair price
for this contract?",00:07:05.300,00:07:10.590
"Well, we will see
how to price it.",00:07:10.590,00:07:12.500
"Well, the few observation here
is that this line represents",00:07:12.500,00:07:17.820
"the payout -- it's always
useful to represent the payout",00:07:17.820,00:07:21.440
graphically.,00:07:21.440,00:07:22.402
"This is just a straight
line because the payout",00:07:22.402,00:07:24.360
"of our contract is
S minus K at time T.",00:07:24.360,00:07:27.720
"This actually gives the current
price of the contract for all",00:07:27.720,00:07:32.520
"different values
of the underlying.",00:07:32.520,00:07:35.570
"Usually, the price of
the forward contract",00:07:35.570,00:07:38.920
"is set such that for the
current value of the underlying,",00:07:38.920,00:07:42.860
"the price of the
contract is zero.",00:07:42.860,00:07:45.010
"It costs nothing to
enter a forward contract,",00:07:45.010,00:07:47.490
"so that's why it
intersects zero here.",00:07:47.490,00:07:52.470
"What are other
common derivatives?",00:07:52.470,00:07:56.576
"Another common derivative
are calls and puts.",00:07:56.576,00:07:58.450
"And I put European
call and put here.",00:07:58.450,00:08:03.210
"Don't be confused by
European or American.",00:08:03.210,00:08:05.300
"It has nothing to do
with Europe or America,",00:08:05.300,00:08:08.030
"it has to do with the
structure of the contract.",00:08:08.030,00:08:12.450
"European basically
means that the contract",00:08:12.450,00:08:16.230
"expires at certain
time T. American means",00:08:16.230,00:08:19.280
"that's you can exercise
this contract at any time",00:08:19.280,00:08:22.240
between now and future.,00:08:22.240,00:08:24.690
"We'll be talking only
about European contracts.",00:08:24.690,00:08:27.270
"So European call
option is a contract",00:08:27.270,00:08:30.860
"which gives you the
right, but not obligation,",00:08:30.860,00:08:35.650
"to purchase the underlying
security at set price K, which",00:08:35.650,00:08:40.530
"is called strike
price, at a future time",00:08:40.530,00:08:43.640
"T, which is expiration time.",00:08:43.640,00:08:46.020
"So if your security at
time T ends up below K,",00:08:46.020,00:08:52.270
"below the strike,
then sure enough",00:08:52.270,00:08:55.170
"there is no point of
buying the security",00:08:55.170,00:08:59.330
for a more expensive price.,00:08:59.330,00:09:01.390
"So the contract
expires worthless.",00:09:01.390,00:09:04.170
"On the other hand, if your stock
ends up being greater than K",00:09:04.170,00:09:08.980
"at expiration time
C, then you would",00:09:08.980,00:09:12.550
"make money but my
purchasing this stock for K",00:09:12.550,00:09:16.340
"dollars and your payout
will be S minus K,",00:09:16.340,00:09:19.930
"and this is a graph
of your payout.",00:09:19.930,00:09:22.100
"This line here, as we will
see, is the current price",00:09:22.100,00:09:28.110
"of the contract, and
we'll see how to obtain",00:09:28.110,00:09:30.260
this line in a few minutes.,00:09:30.260,00:09:33.880
"Another common
contract is a put.",00:09:33.880,00:09:38.250
"While call was basically a
bet that your stock will grow,",00:09:38.250,00:09:43.750
"right, the put is the bet
that your stock will not grow.",00:09:43.750,00:09:48.640
"So, in this case, the put is the
right, but not the obligation",00:09:48.640,00:09:54.090
"to sell the stock for
a certain price K.",00:09:54.090,00:09:58.260
"Here is the payout, which
is similar to the put,",00:09:58.260,00:10:03.640
but just flipped.,00:10:03.640,00:10:06.830
"This is the current
price of a put option.",00:10:06.830,00:10:10.250
"Calls and puts, being
very common contracts,",00:10:10.250,00:10:13.180
"are traded on exchanges --
Chicago exchange is probably",00:10:13.180,00:10:21.230
"the most common place for
the calls and puts on stocks",00:10:21.230,00:10:25.790
to trade.,00:10:25.790,00:10:27.040
"I just printed out
a Bloomberg screen,",00:10:27.040,00:10:29.510
"which gives the information
about a few calls",00:10:29.510,00:10:33.880
and puts on IBM stock.,00:10:33.880,00:10:36.370
"So I did it on March
8, and the IBM stock",00:10:36.370,00:10:41.450
"was trading at this
time at $81.14,",00:10:41.450,00:10:44.410
"and here are descriptions
of the contract,",00:10:44.410,00:10:46.900
"they expire on 22nd
of April, so it's",00:10:46.900,00:10:50.260
pretty short-dated contract.,00:10:50.260,00:10:52.520
"They can go as far as two
years from now, usually.",00:10:52.520,00:10:56.420
"Here is a set of strikes,
and here are a set of prices.",00:10:56.420,00:11:01.990
"As you can see, there
is no single price,",00:11:01.990,00:11:05.150
"there is always a bid and
ask, and that's how dealers",00:11:05.150,00:11:07.830
"and brokers make their
money -- like a bookie,",00:11:07.830,00:11:10.930
"they basically charge you
a fee for selling or buying",00:11:10.930,00:11:15.520
the contract.,00:11:15.520,00:11:16.390
"That's how the money are made
-- they are made on this spread,",00:11:21.420,00:11:24.740
"but not on the price
of the contract itself,",00:11:24.740,00:11:27.390
"because as we will
see in a second,",00:11:27.390,00:11:29.630
"we actually can price
the contract exactly,",00:11:29.630,00:11:33.430
"and there is no uncertainty once
the price of the stock is set.",00:11:33.430,00:11:37.340
"There are plenty
of other options.",00:11:41.680,00:11:44.460
"Slightly more exotics
contracts, either digital",00:11:44.460,00:11:47.230
"which pays either
zero or one depending",00:11:47.230,00:11:50.060
on where your stock ends up.,00:11:50.060,00:11:52.770
"It probably is not
exchange-traded,",00:11:52.770,00:11:54.370
also I'm not sure.,00:11:54.370,00:11:56.840
"There are hundreds,
if not thousands,",00:11:56.840,00:12:00.040
"of exotic options where
you can say that, well,",00:12:00.040,00:12:04.790
"how much would be
the right to purchase",00:12:04.790,00:12:06.980
"a stock for the maximum price
between today and two years",00:12:06.980,00:12:12.040
from now.,00:12:12.040,00:12:13.122
So it will be past-dependent.,00:12:13.122,00:12:14.330
"Depending on how
the stock will go,",00:12:14.330,00:12:17.310
"the payout will be
defined by this path.",00:12:17.310,00:12:20.300
"There are American
options where you",00:12:20.300,00:12:22.540
"can exercise your option any
time between now and maturity,",00:12:22.540,00:12:26.120
and so on and so forth.,00:12:26.120,00:12:27.110
"So, just before we
go into mathematics",00:12:27.110,00:12:32.710
"of pricing, just a few
observations and statements.",00:12:32.710,00:12:40.600
"First of all, it
turns out that thanks",00:12:40.600,00:12:43.550
"to developed mathematics,
mathematical theory,",00:12:43.550,00:12:47.760
"if you make certain assumptions
on the dynamics of the stock,",00:12:47.760,00:12:51.480
"then there is no uncertainty
in the price of the option.",00:12:51.480,00:12:56.390
"You can say exactly how
much the option costs now,",00:12:56.390,00:13:01.360
"and that's what
provides, and this",00:13:01.360,00:13:06.180
is a big driver for the market.,00:13:06.180,00:13:08.020
"So dealers quote these contracts
and there is a great agreement",00:13:08.020,00:13:13.670
on the prices.,00:13:13.670,00:13:17.380
"The price of the
derivative contract",00:13:17.380,00:13:22.250
"is defined completely
by the stock price",00:13:22.250,00:13:25.470
"and not by risk preferences
of the market participant.",00:13:25.470,00:13:29.820
"So it doesn't matter what
are your views on the growth",00:13:29.820,00:13:35.060
prospects of the stock.,00:13:35.060,00:13:38.080
"It will not affect the price
of the derivative contract.",00:13:38.080,00:13:44.150
"As I said, so the
mathematical part of it",00:13:44.150,00:13:48.210
"comes into giving the exact
price without any uncertainty.",00:13:48.210,00:13:52.190
"So let's consider a
simple example now.",00:13:55.080,00:13:59.880
"Let's assume that we are
in a very simple world.",00:13:59.880,00:14:02.690
"Well, first of all, in our world
there are only three objects --",00:14:02.690,00:14:07.180
"the stock itself, the
riskless money market account,",00:14:07.180,00:14:11.690
"meaning that it is an account
where we can either borrow",00:14:11.690,00:14:15.900
"money or invest money
at the riskless rate r,",00:14:15.900,00:14:20.560
"and finally our
derivative contract.",00:14:20.560,00:14:22.800
"Here we are not making any
assumptions of what kind",00:14:22.800,00:14:25.620
"of derivative contract it
is -- it could be forward,",00:14:25.620,00:14:29.200
"it could be call, it could
be put, it can be anything.",00:14:29.200,00:14:33.280
"Moreover, our world is so
simple, that first of all,",00:14:33.280,00:14:35.830
"it's discrete,
and second of all,",00:14:35.830,00:14:38.620
"there is only one time step
to the expiration of power",00:14:38.620,00:14:42.396
"of contract, dt.",00:14:42.396,00:14:44.360
"Not only there is
only one step left,",00:14:44.360,00:14:46.570
"we actually know exactly what
our transition probabilities.",00:14:46.570,00:14:51.690
"There are only two
states at the end,",00:14:51.690,00:14:53.430
"and we know the
transition probability.",00:14:53.430,00:14:55.170
"So with probability p, we
move from the state zero",00:14:55.170,00:14:58.420
"to the state one, and with
probability of one minus p,",00:14:58.420,00:15:01.890
we move to the state two.,00:15:01.890,00:15:04.750
"And just notice, because this is
riskless money market account,",00:15:04.750,00:15:08.100
it's the same in both cases.,00:15:08.100,00:15:10.670
"You just invest money and it
grows with risk-free interest",00:15:10.670,00:15:15.892
rate.,00:15:15.892,00:15:18.420
"So, what can we say about the
price of our derivative f?",00:15:18.420,00:15:23.830
"Well a simple-minded -- well,
let's start with the forward",00:15:23.830,00:15:28.110
contract.,00:15:28.110,00:15:29.310
"We know what the payout in
delta t of our forward contract",00:15:29.310,00:15:32.490
"will be, it will be just the
difference between the stock",00:15:32.490,00:15:35.200
price and our strike.,00:15:35.200,00:15:39.390
"Well, a simple-minded
approach would be -- well,",00:15:39.390,00:15:42.940
"we know the transition
probabilities,",00:15:42.940,00:15:44.990
"let's just compute the
expected value of our contract,",00:15:44.990,00:15:48.980
"and that's what we would expect
to get if there were many such",00:15:48.980,00:15:54.510
experiments.,00:15:54.510,00:15:55.820
"Well, you take the probability
of going to state one,",00:15:55.820,00:15:58.470
"you multiply by the
payoff at stage one.",00:15:58.470,00:16:01.254
"Take, minus p for probability
of going to state two,",00:16:01.254,00:16:03.420
"multiply by the payout
in that state two.",00:16:03.420,00:16:08.590
"Sum them up and you
get the expression.",00:16:08.590,00:16:12.600
"As I said, the common
thing to choose",00:16:12.600,00:16:16.720
"the strike such
that the contract",00:16:16.720,00:16:19.280
"has zero value now, so
you get your strike.",00:16:19.280,00:16:22.796
"Well, in particular
you could say",00:16:22.796,00:16:24.170
"that if you research
the market well",00:16:24.170,00:16:26.440
"and you know that the stock
has equal probability of going",00:16:26.440,00:16:29.350
"up and down, then actually
you expect your strike",00:16:29.350,00:16:33.552
"to be an average of end
values of the stock.",00:16:33.552,00:16:40.400
"But as we can imagine,
following our bookie example,",00:16:40.400,00:16:44.060
this is not the right price.,00:16:44.060,00:16:46.270
"There is actually
a definite price",00:16:46.270,00:16:48.820
"which doesn't depend on
transition probability.",00:16:48.820,00:16:52.580
"Here is the reason why
there is a definite price.",00:16:52.580,00:16:57.220
"Well let's just consider
a very simple strategy.",00:16:57.220,00:17:02.400
"Let's borrow just enough
to purchase a stock.",00:17:02.400,00:17:05.960
"So let's borrow S_0
dollars right now and buy",00:17:05.960,00:17:09.520
the stock for this money.,00:17:09.520,00:17:12.110
"And let's enter the
forward contract.",00:17:12.110,00:17:13.920
"Well, by definition forward
contract has price zero now,",00:17:13.920,00:17:17.410
"so we enter the
forward contract.",00:17:17.410,00:17:20.440
"Now, at the time dt when our
contract expires, what happens?",00:17:20.440,00:17:25.530
"Well, we deliver our
stock, which we already",00:17:25.530,00:17:27.950
"have in our hand in
exchange of K dollars.",00:17:27.950,00:17:32.970
That's our forward contract.,00:17:32.970,00:17:35.220
"On the other hand, we
have to repay our loan,",00:17:35.220,00:17:38.160
"and because it was
a loan, it grew.",00:17:38.160,00:17:40.580
"It grew to S_0
times e to the r*dt.",00:17:40.580,00:17:46.520
"Now, let's see.",00:17:46.520,00:17:47.870
"What would happen if K
was greater than S times e",00:17:47.870,00:17:53.460
to the r*dt?,00:17:53.460,00:17:54.460
"Then we know for sure,
we know now for sure,",00:17:54.460,00:17:58.210
that we would make money.,00:17:58.210,00:18:02.460
"There is no uncertainty
about it now.",00:18:02.460,00:18:06.060
"Similarly, if K is
less than this value,",00:18:06.060,00:18:09.190
"then we know that
we will lose money.",00:18:09.190,00:18:12.550
"That's not how the
rational market works.",00:18:12.550,00:18:14.670
"If everybody knew that
by setting this price",00:18:14.670,00:18:18.170
"you would make money, people
would do it all day long",00:18:18.170,00:18:21.430
and make infinite money.,00:18:21.430,00:18:23.760
"So there will be no
other side of the market.",00:18:23.760,00:18:26.720
So the price has to go down.,00:18:26.720,00:18:28.280
"So the only choice for K, the
only market-implied choice,",00:18:28.280,00:18:35.280
"is that K has to be equal
to S times e to the r*dt.",00:18:35.280,00:18:42.622
"As you can see, it doesn't
depend on transition",00:18:42.622,00:18:44.580
probabilities at all.,00:18:44.580,00:18:46.200
That's what market implies us.,00:18:46.200,00:18:49.560
"That's the price of
forward contract,",00:18:49.560,00:18:51.490
"and that actually
explains why, when",00:18:51.490,00:18:56.190
"I was plotting the
forward contract,",00:18:56.190,00:18:59.130
"current price was just
the straight line,",00:18:59.130,00:19:02.010
it's just discounted payoff.,00:19:02.010,00:19:06.890
"The payout is linear, so just
the parallel to the payoff.",00:19:06.890,00:19:15.630
"That's the idea, basically.",00:19:15.630,00:19:17.690
"The idea is to try to find
such a portfolio of stock",00:19:17.690,00:19:25.280
"and the money market
account with such a payout ,",00:19:25.280,00:19:30.290
"which will exactly replicate
the payoff of our derivative.",00:19:30.290,00:19:35.620
"If we found such of a
portfolio, than we know for sure",00:19:35.620,00:19:37.896
"that the value of
this portfolio,",00:19:37.896,00:19:39.270
"the replicating
portfolio today is",00:19:39.270,00:19:41.520
"equal to the value of the
derivative, because otherwise,",00:19:41.520,00:19:44.590
"you would make or
lose money risklessly.",00:19:44.590,00:19:48.110
That's no-arbitrage condition.,00:19:48.110,00:19:51.550
"So, can we apply it to our
general one-step world?",00:19:51.550,00:19:56.300
"Well, if we have a general
payout f, what we want to do,",00:19:56.300,00:20:01.910
"we want to form a
replicating portfolio such",00:20:01.910,00:20:05.140
"that at expiration time, it
will replicate our payouts.",00:20:05.140,00:20:09.970
"So we want to choose such
constants a and b that such",00:20:09.970,00:20:15.540
"that the combination of
stock and money market",00:20:15.540,00:20:17.550
"account in both
states will replicate",00:20:17.550,00:20:21.430
the payout of our option.,00:20:21.430,00:20:23.570
"Then, if we are able to
find such constants a and b,",00:20:23.570,00:20:27.940
"then we just look at the
current price of the contract",00:20:27.940,00:20:33.900
"and it has to be equal
to the current price",00:20:33.900,00:20:36.620
of our derivative.,00:20:36.620,00:20:38.930
"Well, but in our particular
case, this is easy.",00:20:38.930,00:20:41.360
"It's just two linear equations
with two unknowns, easily",00:20:41.360,00:20:45.770
"solved, and here is current
price of our derivative.",00:20:45.770,00:20:52.020
"No matter what payout is --
I mean you just substitute",00:20:52.020,00:20:54.500
"the payout here, and if you
know S_1 and S_2, that's it.",00:20:54.500,00:21:02.980
"A useful way to look at this,
just to re-write this equation,",00:21:02.980,00:21:06.320
"is in this form, and then notice
that actually the current price",00:21:06.320,00:21:13.350
"of our derivative can be
viewed as a discounted expected",00:21:13.350,00:21:20.510
"payout of the derivative, but
with very certain probability.",00:21:20.510,00:21:25.350
"This probability,
it doesn't come",00:21:25.350,00:21:28.460
"from statistical properties of
the stock or from any research,",00:21:28.460,00:21:32.020
"it actually is
defined by the market.",00:21:32.020,00:21:34.720
"So it's called a
risk-neutral probability.",00:21:34.720,00:21:37.080
"So this probability
doesn't depend",00:21:37.080,00:21:42.050
"on the views on the market
by the market participants.",00:21:42.050,00:21:48.660
"An interesting observation
is that actually,",00:21:48.660,00:21:51.860
"the value of this stock, the
discounted value of the stock",00:21:51.860,00:21:57.435
"is actually also is expected
value of our outcomes",00:21:57.435,00:22:02.860
"under this risk-neutral
probability.",00:22:02.860,00:22:06.850
That's basically general idea.,00:22:06.850,00:22:09.450
"Now let's move one notch
up and try to apply",00:22:09.450,00:22:14.330
these idea to continuous case.,00:22:14.330,00:22:17.760
"Well, if you live in
continuous world now,",00:22:17.760,00:22:20.600
"we need to make some assumptions
on the behavior of the stock.",00:22:20.600,00:22:27.270
"The very common assumption is
that the dynamics of the stock",00:22:27.270,00:22:31.225
is log-normal.,00:22:31.225,00:22:32.770
"Log-normal meaning that
the logarithm of the stock",00:22:32.770,00:22:35.870
"is actually normally
distributed.",00:22:35.870,00:22:38.300
"So, here mu is some drift, sigma
is the volatility of our stock,",00:22:38.300,00:22:43.520
"and dW is a Wiener process,
W is a Wiener process",00:22:43.520,00:22:48.530
"such that dW is
normally distributed",00:22:48.530,00:22:50.970
"with mean zero and
variance square root dt.",00:22:50.970,00:22:56.320
"Our approach would be to find
the replicating portfolio.",00:22:56.320,00:23:00.530
And what does it mean?,00:23:00.530,00:23:01.550
"It means that we want to find
such constants, over time dt --",00:23:01.550,00:23:07.020
"so we assume that a and b are
constant over the next step,",00:23:07.020,00:23:10.900
"dt -- such that the change
in our derivative is a linear",00:23:10.900,00:23:15.730
"combination with this constant
of the change of our underlying",00:23:15.730,00:23:20.600
"security and the change
of money market account.",00:23:20.600,00:23:25.740
"Now we just need to look more
closely at this equation.",00:23:25.740,00:23:31.800
"First of all, let's
concentrate on df.",00:23:31.800,00:23:34.520
"So, f, our derivative,
is a function",00:23:34.520,00:23:44.910
of stock value and time.,00:23:44.910,00:23:48.660
"But unfortunately, our
stock value is stochastic,",00:23:48.660,00:23:52.060
"so df is not that simple, and
to write df out we have to use",00:23:52.060,00:24:00.110
"a famous -- Ito's formula
from stochastic calculus,",00:24:00.110,00:24:03.180
"which actually is analogous of
Taylor's formula for stochastic",00:24:03.180,00:24:10.910
variables.,00:24:10.910,00:24:12.080
Let's see.,00:24:12.080,00:24:12.710
"If our S will not
be stochastic, if it",00:24:12.710,00:24:15.240
"would be completely
deterministic",00:24:15.240,00:24:17.110
"and depend only
on dt, then there",00:24:17.110,00:24:19.640
"would be no term and
differential f is just",00:24:19.640,00:24:24.670
the standard expression.,00:24:24.670,00:24:26.800
"On the other hand,
if we have dependence",00:24:26.800,00:24:31.070
"on stochastic
variables, then we have",00:24:31.070,00:24:35.040
"to have more terms,
and why this happens?",00:24:35.040,00:24:38.130
"Well, in very rough words
is that because the order",00:24:38.130,00:24:41.330
"of magnitude of dW is
higher than dt's --",00:24:41.330,00:24:45.510
it's square root of dt.,00:24:45.510,00:24:47.930
"So we have to make into
account more terms,",00:24:47.930,00:24:51.340
"and in particular, we have to
take into account next order",00:24:51.340,00:24:56.970
of dS squared.,00:24:56.970,00:24:59.070
"Formally, dS square can
be written this way,",00:24:59.070,00:25:01.970
"and again, very rough
explanation is as follows.",00:25:01.970,00:25:04.900
"If we would square
this equation there",00:25:04.900,00:25:07.970
will be three terms there.,00:25:07.970,00:25:09.490
"One would come from the
square of this term,",00:25:09.490,00:25:11.900
"and this would be of
the order of dt squared,",00:25:11.900,00:25:16.530
"next order of magnitude
-- much smaller than dt.",00:25:16.530,00:25:20.240
"The second term will be
cross-product of dW*dt.",00:25:20.240,00:25:23.060
"What order of magnitude
we are talking about,",00:25:23.060,00:25:26.200
"it is dt to the power 3/2,
again, much smaller than dt.",00:25:26.200,00:25:32.990
"On the other hand, the third
term will be the square of dW,",00:25:32.990,00:25:37.090
"this is of order
of magnitude of dt,",00:25:37.090,00:25:40.520
so that's what we have to keep.,00:25:40.520,00:25:43.500
"And that's what Ito's
formula is about.",00:25:43.500,00:25:48.990
"Now, we are basically,
we know all terms here,",00:25:48.990,00:25:56.210
"and let me stress out that this
term, dB, it is not stochastic,",00:25:56.210,00:26:01.560
"it's completely
deterministic because we",00:26:01.560,00:26:04.860
"know that B grows with the
rate r, that's what it is.",00:26:04.860,00:26:09.350
"So we substitute all those terms
into our replicating equation.",00:26:09.350,00:26:14.510
We collect the terms.,00:26:14.510,00:26:16.000
We get this equation.,00:26:16.000,00:26:17.120
"And again, there is
the deterministic part,",00:26:17.120,00:26:19.580
there is stochastic part.,00:26:19.580,00:26:20.850
"So the only way for
this equation to hold",00:26:20.850,00:26:23.710
"is this term to be equal
to this term, and this term",00:26:23.710,00:26:27.543
"to be equal to this term, and
that's what's written out here.",00:26:27.543,00:26:32.170
"So again, two equations,
these two unknowns, and here",00:26:32.170,00:26:34.780
is answer.,00:26:34.780,00:26:35.660
"Finally, let's take
a*S to another part.",00:26:38.210,00:26:47.800
"Notice that this
part of our equation",00:26:47.800,00:26:50.720
is completely deterministic.,00:26:50.720,00:26:53.880
So we know how it will grow.,00:26:53.880,00:26:55.810
"So basically, d of f minus
a*S, which is b times dB,",00:26:55.810,00:27:01.020
is r times b times dt.,00:27:01.020,00:27:05.890
"And we know all other
terms, we substitute them",00:27:05.890,00:27:08.740
"here, take something
to the left-hand side",00:27:08.740,00:27:12.670
and get this equation.,00:27:12.670,00:27:14.220
"So this is partial differential
equation for our derivative f,",00:27:14.220,00:27:21.680
"as a function of S and
t, of second order,",00:27:21.680,00:27:26.670
"and this equation is the
famous Black-Scholes equation.",00:27:26.670,00:27:30.310
"It was derived by Fischer
Black and Myron Scholes",00:27:30.310,00:27:34.200
"in their famous paper
published in 1973.",00:27:34.200,00:27:38.940
"Myron Scholes and
Robert Merton actually",00:27:38.940,00:27:41.240
"received Nobel Prize
for deriving and solving",00:27:41.240,00:27:44.640
this equation in '97.,00:27:44.640,00:27:47.560
"Black was already
dead by the time.",00:27:47.560,00:27:51.250
"This is really the
cornerstone of math finance.",00:27:51.250,00:27:55.320
"The cornerstone is because
using the replicating portfolio,",00:27:59.290,00:28:05.780
"using this reasoning, we were
able to find an exact equation",00:28:05.780,00:28:12.080
for our derivative.,00:28:12.080,00:28:14.040
"So a few remarks
on Black-Scholes.",00:28:14.040,00:28:16.980
"So first of all, we
made some assumptions",00:28:16.980,00:28:20.930
"on the dynamic of the stock, but
we never made any assumptions",00:28:20.930,00:28:24.600
on our derivative.,00:28:24.600,00:28:27.150
"Which means that any derivative
has to satisfy this equation,",00:28:27.150,00:28:32.610
"and that's very strong
result. So if you",00:28:32.610,00:28:35.040
"assume that our
stock is lognormal,",00:28:35.040,00:28:36.740
"which is not a bad assumption
and agrees quite well",00:28:36.740,00:28:39.780
"with the market, then we
basically, in principle,",00:28:39.780,00:28:42.810
can price any derivative.,00:28:42.810,00:28:44.470
"We know the equation
for any derivative.",00:28:44.470,00:28:48.400
"The other thing is that
our Black-Scholes equation",00:28:48.400,00:28:51.800
"doesn't depend on
the actual drift mu",00:28:51.800,00:28:55.530
in the dynamics of our stock.,00:28:55.530,00:28:57.180
"So again, it is the manifest
of risk-neutral dynamic.",00:28:57.180,00:29:06.320
"Not only we wrote down the
equation for our derivative,",00:29:06.320,00:29:12.150
"we also found a
replicating portfolio.",00:29:12.150,00:29:15.030
"So in other words, we
found a hedging strategy,",00:29:15.030,00:29:18.280
"meaning that at
any given time we",00:29:18.280,00:29:21.795
"can form this portfolio
with rates a and b.",00:29:21.795,00:29:28.360
"If we hold both the derivative
and both replicating portfolio,",00:29:28.360,00:29:33.460
"altogether, this
is zero sum gain.",00:29:33.460,00:29:38.490
"We know that no matter
where stock moves,",00:29:38.490,00:29:41.950
"we will not lose
money or gain money.",00:29:41.950,00:29:44.710
"So if we just charge
bid-offer on the derivative,",00:29:44.710,00:29:51.110
"if we charge a fee
on the contract,",00:29:51.110,00:29:53.330
"we can hedge ourself
perfectly, buy the contract",00:29:53.330,00:29:56.420
"or sell the contract,
hedge perfectly ourself",00:29:56.420,00:29:58.970
"and just make money
on the fee, that's it.",00:29:58.970,00:30:01.460
"Finally, more
mathematical remark",00:30:06.180,00:30:09.060
"is that actually after a few
manipulations, a few change",00:30:09.060,00:30:13.250
"of variables, the Black-Scholes
equation comes out",00:30:13.250,00:30:16.710
"to be just a heat
question, which you already",00:30:16.710,00:30:19.980
saw in this class.,00:30:19.980,00:30:22.190
This is very good news.,00:30:22.190,00:30:23.650
Why is this good news?,00:30:23.650,00:30:25.000
"Well, because heat equation
is very well studied.",00:30:25.000,00:30:27.250
"So the solutions are well-known,
and numerical methods, the ways",00:30:27.250,00:30:32.986
"to solve it, in particular
the numerical ways",00:30:32.986,00:30:34.860
to solve it are well-known.,00:30:34.860,00:30:36.760
So we are in business.,00:30:36.760,00:30:38.220
"But as any partial
differential equation,",00:30:38.220,00:30:45.130
"the equation itself doesn't
make much sense because to find",00:30:45.130,00:30:49.450
"a particular solution we need
boundary and initial condition.",00:30:49.450,00:30:55.610
"And although any derivative
satisfies Black-Scholes",00:30:58.520,00:31:01.940
"equation, the final
and boundary conditions",00:31:01.940,00:31:08.310
"will vary from
contract to contract.",00:31:08.310,00:31:10.720
"Here are a few examples of the
final and boundary conditions.",00:31:10.720,00:31:15.510
"Here, an interesting
remark that if, usually,",00:31:15.510,00:31:18.680
"we would talk about
initial condition, here",00:31:18.680,00:31:22.270
"we are talking about
final condition.",00:31:22.270,00:31:24.650
"The time goes in
reverse; we know",00:31:24.650,00:31:26.340
"the state of the world at the
end, at expiration, not today.",00:31:26.340,00:31:30.150
"So, here are final and boundary
conditions for call and put,",00:31:30.150,00:31:36.810
"and let's look a little bit
at the pictures for our call",00:31:36.810,00:31:40.640
"and put to see where
they come from.",00:31:40.640,00:31:44.250
"So for example, for calls, well,
this is our final condition,",00:31:44.250,00:31:48.950
"right, this is
defined by the payout.",00:31:48.950,00:31:50.930
"On the other hand, the boundary
condition, well, what happens,",00:31:50.930,00:31:54.690
"we put them at zero at an
infinity, we [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]",00:31:54.690,00:31:57.646
"to put them at
zero and infinity.",00:31:57.646,00:31:59.020
And why?,00:31:59.020,00:31:59.519
"Well, because if stock hits
zero then it stays at zero.",00:31:59.519,00:32:03.340
That's what our dynamics show.,00:32:03.340,00:32:06.330
"So the value of our contract
at maturity will become zero.",00:32:06.330,00:32:11.400
"On the other hand, if the
stock grows, grows to infinity,",00:32:11.400,00:32:14.990
"a good assumption to
make is that actually it",00:32:14.990,00:32:17.360
"becomes similar to stock
itself, so it would just",00:32:17.360,00:32:19.830
"become parallel to the stock,
and that's the conditions",00:32:19.830,00:32:26.160
which we impose here.,00:32:26.160,00:32:27.150
"Similarly for the put, you
can derive these conditions.",00:32:30.270,00:32:36.290
"And again, just because
it is a heat equation,",00:32:36.290,00:32:41.740
"it turns out that for a simple
derivative such as the calls",00:32:41.740,00:32:44.910
"and puts, it is possible to
find an exact analytic solution.",00:32:44.910,00:32:50.070
"Here are exact analytic set
of solutions for a call, put",00:32:50.070,00:32:54.350
and the digital contracts.,00:32:54.350,00:32:57.090
"Well, not surprising
again, I mean",00:32:57.090,00:33:01.310
"they're all connected
to the error function,",00:33:01.310,00:33:04.310
"so to the normal
distribution, basically,",00:33:04.310,00:33:07.760
"as the solutions of heat
equation ought to be.",00:33:07.760,00:33:12.400
"Why do they look
exactly the same?",00:33:12.400,00:33:14.580
"If we have five
minutes at the end,",00:33:14.580,00:33:17.020
"we'll probably shed some
light on the specific form",00:33:17.020,00:33:21.690
of equations.,00:33:21.690,00:33:22.750
"But let me just stress that we
can see that it's discounted,",00:33:22.750,00:33:28.090
"and what I'm claiming, it's
expected value of our payout",00:33:28.090,00:33:32.790
under risk-neutral measure.,00:33:32.790,00:33:36.810
"Here is an example -- it's
of a particular call option",00:33:36.810,00:33:42.290
on the same IBM stock.,00:33:42.290,00:33:44.160
"So I chose the
short-dated contract,",00:33:44.160,00:33:46.580
"just to avoid the
dividend payment.",00:33:46.580,00:33:50.300
"So it's a contract
expiring on March 18.",00:33:50.300,00:33:53.820
"So there is 10
days to expiration.",00:33:53.820,00:33:56.750
"The stock, as we saw,
the expirations of stock,",00:33:56.750,00:34:02.170
"as we saw, is what's
trading at 81.14.",00:34:02.170,00:34:06.750
"The volatility is
somewhere around 14%,",00:34:06.750,00:34:11.800
"estimated either from other
options or historically.",00:34:11.800,00:34:17.110
"Here is the price
of our contract.",00:34:17.110,00:34:20.210
"I also have a simple
Black-Scholes calculator here,",00:34:20.210,00:34:23.750
"and let's see if we
can match this price.",00:34:23.750,00:34:28.800
"So let's see, I believe the
volatility was 13%, right,",00:34:28.800,00:34:39.280
13.47.,00:34:39.280,00:34:42.240
"The interest rate,
it's already here.",00:34:42.240,00:34:45.220
"As we all know, Fed just
bumped the interest rate,",00:34:45.220,00:34:48.540
so they are at 4.75% right now.,00:34:48.540,00:34:51.980
The strike of our option was 80.,00:34:51.980,00:34:56.360
"Time to expiration
was actually 10 days,",00:34:56.360,00:34:58.840
"and this should be measured
at a fraction of year.",00:34:58.840,00:35:02.390
So we divide 10 by 365.,00:35:02.390,00:35:08.440
"This stock was trading at
81.14, if I'm not mistaken.",00:35:08.440,00:35:15.350
"Here is the price of our call
options contract, which is 150.",00:35:15.350,00:35:21.210
"Well, it's within the offer.",00:35:21.210,00:35:26.630
"So maybe our
volatility's slightly off",00:35:26.630,00:35:29.070
"and if we increase
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] to say,",00:35:29.070,00:35:35.140
"increase it to 14%, it
will go slightly up.",00:35:35.140,00:35:42.330
152.,00:35:42.330,00:35:44.800
"Well, in general, let's
play a little bit with it.",00:35:44.800,00:35:48.580
"Well, it is very
short-dated option,",00:35:48.580,00:35:50.480
"so the value of our option
is very close to the payout.",00:35:50.480,00:35:55.990
"So if we increase
the time to maturity,",00:35:55.990,00:35:58.870
"let's make it two years
just to see where --",00:35:58.870,00:36:02.280
"so now value of our option is
-- well, that's what it is.",00:36:02.280,00:36:08.980
"If increase volatility, sure
enough, let's make it 30%.",00:36:08.980,00:36:15.040
So what do we expect?,00:36:15.040,00:36:15.970
"We expect if volatility is
higher, the uncertainty higher,",00:36:15.970,00:36:19.340
"so the value of our contract
should go up, and it sure does.",00:36:19.340,00:36:25.300
"So basically that's how
Black-Scholes works.",00:36:29.120,00:36:31.520
"And plenty of those
contracts trade",00:36:39.690,00:36:41.520
"on the market, but unfortunately
not all of these contracts",00:36:41.520,00:36:47.670
are so simple as calls and puts.,00:36:47.670,00:36:50.600
"First of all, there are many
more complicated products",00:36:50.600,00:36:55.610
"with more difficult payout,
which will constitute different",00:36:55.610,00:37:03.390
"and probably discontinuous final
conditions on our Black-Scholes",00:37:03.390,00:37:08.800
equation.,00:37:08.800,00:37:10.930
"Moreover, we made an
assumption that the volatility",00:37:10.930,00:37:14.590
"is constant with time,
and interest rate",00:37:14.590,00:37:16.650
is constant with time.,00:37:16.650,00:37:18.210
"It is certainly not
true for the real world.",00:37:18.210,00:37:21.860
"Volatility probably
should be time-dependent,",00:37:21.860,00:37:24.790
"and this would make
the coefficients",00:37:24.790,00:37:26.540
"in our Black-Scholes
equation time-dependent.",00:37:26.540,00:37:30.090
"Unfortunately, these cannot
be solve analytically.",00:37:30.090,00:37:33.250
"So in most of the
cases in practice,",00:37:33.250,00:37:36.420
"we will have to use some
kind of numerical solution.",00:37:36.420,00:37:42.530
"Finite difference methods
is the typical approach",00:37:42.530,00:37:45.870
for the heat equation.,00:37:45.870,00:37:47.200
"As you know, both explicit
and implicit schemes,",00:37:47.200,00:37:50.330
"and you will discuss
some of those in 18.086.",00:37:50.330,00:37:57.910
Tree methods.,00:37:57.910,00:37:58.630
"Tree methods meaning that we
go back to our one-step tree,",00:37:58.630,00:38:05.090
"and basically assume that
our time to expiration",00:38:05.090,00:38:08.380
"is many time steps away and
we'll grow the tree further,",00:38:08.380,00:38:12.000
"so from this node we
have two more nodes,",00:38:12.000,00:38:14.270
and so and so forth.,00:38:14.270,00:38:15.550
"That would imply the final
condition at the end,",00:38:15.550,00:38:19.670
"and discount back using our
risk-neutral probabilities,",00:38:19.670,00:38:23.640
and get the price now.,00:38:23.640,00:38:25.170
"So those are called
tree methods.",00:38:25.170,00:38:27.240
"One can show that actually those
tree methods are equivalent",00:38:27.240,00:38:30.330
"to finite difference -- explicit
finite difference schemes.",00:38:30.330,00:38:36.100
Those are very popular.,00:38:36.100,00:38:38.110
"But again, in tree methods,
what is very important",00:38:38.110,00:38:41.830
"is to set the probabilities
from your tree, the transition",00:38:41.830,00:38:44.746
"probabilities, to
the right ones,",00:38:44.746,00:38:46.120
"and the right ones are
risk-neutral probabilities.",00:38:46.120,00:38:48.960
"Probabilities implied
by the market, actually.",00:38:48.960,00:38:53.170
"Another important numerical
method is Monte Carlo",00:38:53.170,00:38:58.280
"simulation where you would
simulate many different",00:38:58.280,00:39:02.910
"scenarios of the development of
your stock up to the maturity,",00:39:02.910,00:39:05.650
"and then, basically
find -- using this path,",00:39:05.650,00:39:09.840
"you will find the expected
value of your payout.",00:39:09.840,00:39:15.990
"But again, in order
for this expected value",00:39:15.990,00:39:20.210
"to be the same as the
risk-neutral value,",00:39:20.210,00:39:24.810
"as the arbitrage-free
value, you have",00:39:24.810,00:39:27.050
"to develop your Monte
Carlo simulations",00:39:27.050,00:39:29.910
with risk-neutral probabilities.,00:39:29.910,00:39:31.800
"So, risk-neutral valuation
is extremely important.",00:39:31.800,00:39:37.360
"Here is actually the general
risk-neutral statement, which",00:39:40.780,00:39:45.810
"one can prove, is that actually,
the value of any derivative",00:39:45.810,00:39:51.580
"is just discounted expected
value of the payout",00:39:51.580,00:39:56.140
"of this derivative
at maturity, but you",00:39:56.140,00:39:59.280
"have to take this expectation
at the right measure.",00:39:59.280,00:40:02.140
"Using the right measure, meaning
that you have to set correctly",00:40:02.140,00:40:05.230
"the transition probability
-- you have to make them",00:40:05.230,00:40:08.705
market-neutral.,00:40:08.705,00:40:09.330
"Under this measure, actually
the dynamics of our stocks",00:40:12.710,00:40:19.950
"looks slightly different,
and as you can see,",00:40:19.950,00:40:22.660
"our drift becomes
the interest rate.",00:40:22.660,00:40:25.240
"So under risk-neutral
measure, everything",00:40:25.240,00:40:27.810
"grows with our
risk-free interest rate.",00:40:27.810,00:40:32.430
"Just to shed a little
bit of light on how we go",00:40:32.430,00:40:38.720
"at the solutions
for calls and puts,",00:40:38.720,00:40:42.630
"Black-Scholes solutions
for call and put,",00:40:42.630,00:40:44.920
"well this is the
distribution of our stock,",00:40:44.920,00:40:47.920
"log-normal distribution
of our stock at time T,",00:40:47.920,00:40:51.790
"and if we take this distribution
and integrate our payout",00:40:51.790,00:40:57.660
"of our call option against this
distribution -- in other words,",00:40:57.660,00:41:01.950
"find the expected value of
payout of our call option under",00:41:01.950,00:41:10.260
"risk-neutral measure,
then, sure enough,",00:41:10.260,00:41:17.810
"you will get
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].",00:41:17.810,00:41:21.200
"This illustrates the best
-- because what is digital?",00:41:21.200,00:41:24.000
"Digital is just the
probability to end up",00:41:24.000,00:41:26.750
"at above the strike
at time T, right?",00:41:26.750,00:41:29.590
"So if you integrate
this log-normal pdf",00:41:29.590,00:41:34.110
"from the strike K to infinity,
that will be your answer.",00:41:34.110,00:41:42.310
"This is a good exercise
in integration,",00:41:42.310,00:41:44.930
to make sure that it's correct.,00:41:44.930,00:41:47.760
So let's see.,00:41:47.760,00:41:49.270
"To conclude, what we've seen.",00:41:49.270,00:41:52.170
"So, we have seen that modern
derivatives business makes",00:41:52.170,00:42:02.180
"use of quite
advanced mathematics,",00:42:02.180,00:42:04.600
"and what kinds of
mathematics is used there?",00:42:04.600,00:42:08.050
"Well, partial differential
equations are used heavily.",00:42:08.050,00:42:12.630
"Numerical methods
for the solution",00:42:12.630,00:42:14.530
"of this partial differential
equations are naturally used.",00:42:14.530,00:42:20.470
"In order to get these
equations, we actually",00:42:20.470,00:42:23.890
"need to operate in terms
of stochastic calculus,",00:42:23.890,00:42:26.870
"meaning that we need to know
how to deal with Ito calculus,",00:42:26.870,00:42:31.180
"Ito formula, Girsanov theorem,
and so on and so forth.",00:42:31.180,00:42:36.580
"The other thing is to be
able to build simulations",00:42:36.580,00:42:41.330
"to solve the heat equation
and all other equations",00:42:41.330,00:42:45.380
that you might encounter.,00:42:45.380,00:42:47.780
"The topic which we
didn't touch upon",00:42:47.780,00:42:51.230
"is statistics because,
of course, very advanced",00:42:51.230,00:42:54.660
"statistics is used
for many, many things,",00:42:54.660,00:42:58.690
"for analyzing
historical data, which",00:42:58.690,00:43:02.320
"can be quite
beautiful for trading",00:43:02.320,00:43:04.040
strategies and many others.,00:43:04.040,00:43:07.660
"Besides these five topics,
there is much, much more",00:43:07.660,00:43:12.450
"to mathematical finance,
which makes it a very, very",00:43:12.450,00:43:17.400
exciting field to work in.,00:43:17.400,00:43:19.760
"That's what I wanted
to talk about.",00:43:19.760,00:43:22.126
"Thank you very much
for your attention.",00:43:22.126,00:43:23.750
"PROFESSOR: Maybe I'll
ask a firm question",00:43:30.890,00:43:35.430
"about boundary
conditions, because you",00:43:35.430,00:43:38.100
"had said that
those are different",00:43:38.100,00:43:40.060
for different contracts.,00:43:40.060,00:43:42.860
"And how do you deal with them
in the finite differences",00:43:42.860,00:43:47.290
or the tree model or whatever?,00:43:47.290,00:43:52.140
What would be a typical one?,00:43:52.140,00:43:54.750
"GUEST SPEAKER: Well, typical
one -- two very typical ones.",00:43:54.750,00:43:57.560
"So those, you basically
make a grid of your problem,",00:43:57.560,00:44:05.500
"in particular, you
build a tree, which",00:44:05.500,00:44:08.100
"is actually a grid of
all possible outcomes.",00:44:08.100,00:44:11.650
"You set them up at the
end, so your tree grows --",00:44:11.650,00:44:28.490
"so you set your boundary here
at the end, and well, you set,",00:44:28.490,00:44:36.310
"probably, some initial --
this is final condition,",00:44:36.310,00:44:45.480
"so you set some boundary
conditions here.",00:44:45.480,00:44:48.690
"So this is your time T. This
is t = 0, time t -- this is 0,",00:44:48.690,00:44:55.710
"this is 1, this is 2, this is
T. So you set your payout here,",00:44:55.710,00:45:04.030
"so it will be maximum
of S minus K and 0.",00:45:04.030,00:45:11.340
"PROFESSOR: How many time
steps might you take in this?",00:45:11.340,00:45:14.940
"GUEST SPEAKER: Well, you would
do like daily for three months",00:45:14.940,00:45:20.315
-- if you three-month options.,00:45:20.315,00:45:22.476
PROFESSOR: Maybe 100 steps.,00:45:22.476,00:45:23.600
"GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah,
something like that.",00:45:23.600,00:45:25.308
"Well, if it's two-year option,
that you probably would do it",00:45:25.308,00:45:28.470
weekly or something like that.,00:45:28.470,00:45:30.820
"PROFESSOR: You don't
get into large,",00:45:30.820,00:45:32.350
"what would be scientifically,
large-scale calculating.",00:45:32.350,00:45:35.490
"PROFESSOR: No, in
finance we usually",00:45:35.490,00:45:37.490
don't keep this problem--.,00:45:37.490,00:45:39.040
"PROFESSOR: In
finite differences,",00:45:39.040,00:45:40.810
"do you use like higher-order
-- suppose, well,",00:45:40.810,00:45:44.670
"you had second derivatives,
would you always use second",00:45:44.670,00:45:47.230
"differences or
second-order accuracy?",00:45:47.230,00:45:51.449
"GUEST SPEAKER: In general, yes.",00:45:51.449,00:45:52.740
"In general,
second-order accuracy.",00:45:52.740,00:45:55.790
In general you don't go higher.,00:45:55.790,00:45:58.210
"I mean the precision -- well,
it's within cents, right.",00:45:58.210,00:46:01.920
"So you cannot do
better than that.",00:46:01.920,00:46:06.010
"So it depends -- well, it
depends what kind of amount you",00:46:06.010,00:46:11.650
are dealing with.,00:46:11.650,00:46:12.830
"If you're actually selling
and buying units of stock,",00:46:12.830,00:46:16.775
"you might consider
something more precise.",00:46:16.775,00:46:21.080
But it's very problem-defined.,00:46:21.080,00:46:25.220
So that's how we deal with it.,00:46:30.280,00:46:33.370
PROFESSOR: Any questions?,00:46:33.370,00:46:35.770
"You can put the mic on
if you have a question.",00:46:35.770,00:46:38.440
"STUDENT:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].",00:46:38.440,00:46:45.080
"GUEST SPEAKER: Well,
it is Markov process.",00:46:55.800,00:46:58.000
Yes.,00:46:58.000,00:46:58.500
"I mean, this is just
a numerical solution.",00:46:58.500,00:47:01.480
"So yeah, it is Markov process.",00:47:01.480,00:47:02.910
"and basically all
stochastic calculus",00:47:02.910,00:47:04.990
"is about Markov process,
continuous Markov process.",00:47:04.990,00:47:07.590
"PROFESSOR: Is the
mathematics that you",00:47:15.030,00:47:17.010
"get involved with pretty
well set now or is there",00:47:17.010,00:47:22.600
"a need for more
mathematics, if I",00:47:22.600,00:47:27.000
can ask the question that way?,00:47:27.000,00:47:28.920
"PROFESSOR: Yeah,
well, in this field",00:47:28.920,00:47:31.140
it is probably quite well set.,00:47:31.140,00:47:33.610
"But if you get into
more complicated fields,",00:47:33.610,00:47:37.410
"especially into credit modeling,
the model for the credits",00:47:37.410,00:47:44.690
"of certain companies, then
mathematics is not quite set,",00:47:44.690,00:47:49.810
"because there, you start
talking about jump processes",00:47:49.810,00:47:53.730
"and not Wiener processes, not
just log-normal processes.",00:47:53.730,00:47:58.860
"This stochastic differential
equation become very hard,",00:47:58.860,00:48:03.070
"but maybe still
analytically tractable.",00:48:03.070,00:48:06.150
"So from this point of
view there is need --",00:48:06.150,00:48:09.330
"but it's not a
fundamental mathematics,",00:48:09.330,00:48:13.281
"it's not that you are
opening a new field,",00:48:13.281,00:48:15.030
"but definitely trying to solve
a stochastic differential",00:48:15.030,00:48:21.170
"equation -- which usually
boils down to solving a partial",00:48:21.170,00:48:23.840
"differential equation
analytically --",00:48:23.840,00:48:26.780
"can be pretty hard a
mathematical problem,",00:48:26.780,00:48:30.280
"viewed as a
mathematical problem.",00:48:30.280,00:48:32.280
"PROFESSOR: So you
showed the example",00:48:32.280,00:48:33.790
of Black-Scholes solver.,00:48:33.790,00:48:37.700
"Everybody has that
available all the time?",00:48:37.700,00:48:39.872
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh yeah.,00:48:39.872,00:48:40.830
"On Chicago trading
floor, the traders",00:48:40.830,00:48:44.550
"have calculators where
they just press a button",00:48:44.550,00:48:47.520
and it's just hard-wired there.,00:48:47.520,00:48:49.104
"PROFESSOR: And they're
printing out error functions,",00:48:49.104,00:48:51.270
"basically -- a combination
of error function, yeah.",00:48:51.270,00:48:55.060
"GUEST SPEAKER: Well, sure
enough, nobody uses just --",00:48:55.060,00:49:01.110
"I mean this was very approximate
example and that's why I chose",00:49:01.110,00:49:04.820
"such short-dated stock, that
before it pays any dividends,",00:49:04.820,00:49:09.390
"and where we can assume
the volatility is constant,",00:49:09.390,00:49:12.920
"and so on and so forth,
to match the prices.",00:49:12.920,00:49:15.400
"Otherwise, the prices
wouldn't match.",00:49:15.400,00:49:28.430
