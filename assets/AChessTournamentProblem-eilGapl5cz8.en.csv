Hi.,00:00:00.000,00:00:01.020
Welcome back.,00:00:01.020,00:00:02.200
"Today, we're going to do a fun
problem called the chess",00:00:02.200,00:00:05.010
tournament problem.,00:00:05.010,00:00:07.280
"Now, it's a very long problem,
so I just want to jump",00:00:07.280,00:00:10.640
straight in.,00:00:10.640,00:00:11.870
"Essentially, the problem
statement describes a very",00:00:11.870,00:00:15.300
"special chess tournament, which
involves players named",00:00:15.300,00:00:20.080
"Al, Bo, and Chi.",00:00:20.080,00:00:22.150
"Now Al is the current reigning
championship, and Bo and Chi",00:00:22.150,00:00:27.510
"are this year's contenders, and,
of course, they're vying",00:00:27.510,00:00:30.550
"with each other to beat out Al
and become the new champion.",00:00:30.550,00:00:35.040
"And so essentially,
the tournament is",00:00:35.040,00:00:38.460
divided into two rounds--,00:00:38.460,00:00:40.490
"a first round, during which Bo
and Chi play against each",00:00:40.490,00:00:43.470
"other, and then a second
round, during which the",00:00:43.470,00:00:46.230
"surviving contender from the
first round plays against Al.",00:00:46.230,00:00:51.390
"And the problem statement also
gives you a bunch of",00:00:51.390,00:00:53.750
"information like what's the
probability that Bo beats Chi",00:00:53.750,00:00:57.760
"in a particular game,
et cetera.",00:00:57.760,00:01:00.820
"So without further ado, let's
get started on part a.",00:01:00.820,00:01:05.040
"In part a, the first thing we're
asked to compute is the",00:01:05.040,00:01:07.910
"probability that a second
round is required.",00:01:07.910,00:01:11.410
"Now, to save myself some
writing, I used the notation",00:01:11.410,00:01:15.530
R2 to denote that event.,00:01:15.530,00:01:17.870
"So we are interested in
probability of R2.",00:01:17.870,00:01:24.300
"Now, I claim that this problem
is very sequential in nature",00:01:24.300,00:01:28.170
"so I would like to draw a tree
to describe what's happening.",00:01:28.170,00:01:32.440
"So in the first part of the
tournament, when Bo and Chi",00:01:32.440,00:01:36.380
"play their first game, exactly
one of two things can happen--",00:01:36.380,00:01:41.060
"either Bo can win
or Chi can win.",00:01:41.060,00:01:44.370
"And we're told by the problem
statement that Bo wins with",00:01:44.370,00:01:47.630
"the probability of 0.6 and,
therefore, Chi must win with",00:01:47.630,00:01:51.610
"the probability of 0.4, right?",00:01:51.610,00:01:53.600
"Because these two possibilities
must sum to 1,",00:01:53.600,00:01:56.580
"because either this must
happen or this happen.",00:01:56.580,00:02:01.190
"Now, let's imagine that the
first game has been played and",00:02:01.190,00:02:04.490
that Bo won.,00:02:04.490,00:02:06.210
"Well, during the second game,
there's still two options for",00:02:06.210,00:02:09.800
the outcome--,00:02:09.800,00:02:10.340
"Bo could win the second
game or Chi could",00:02:10.340,00:02:12.345
win the second game.,00:02:12.345,00:02:14.380
"And because the problem
statement says that in every",00:02:14.380,00:02:17.830
"scenario Bo always wins
against Chi with the",00:02:17.830,00:02:20.310
"probability of 0.6, we can go
ahead and put a 0.6 along this",00:02:20.310,00:02:24.640
branch as well.,00:02:24.640,00:02:26.200
"Similarly, 0.4 here.",00:02:26.200,00:02:28.060
"And similar logic, you've got
a tree that looks like this.",00:02:28.060,00:02:33.290
"And for those of you who haven't
seen trees before,",00:02:33.290,00:02:36.440
"it's just a structure that looks
something like this.",00:02:36.440,00:02:39.650
"And it helps us do better
accounting.",00:02:39.650,00:02:41.920
"It helps us keep straight in our
head what are the various",00:02:41.920,00:02:45.060
"outcomes, so that we
don't get confused.",00:02:45.060,00:02:47.870
"And so very quickly here, you
can see that there's four",00:02:47.870,00:02:51.160
possible outcomes.,00:02:51.160,00:02:53.410
"So each node in this tree
corresponds to an outcome.",00:02:53.410,00:02:56.490
"And the leaves are those nodes
at the furthest stage.",00:02:56.490,00:03:01.170
"And it's convention to draw
the probability of a",00:03:01.170,00:03:04.840
particular--,00:03:04.840,00:03:05.900
"so for instance, the probability
that Bo wins the",00:03:05.900,00:03:09.480
"first game-- it's just
convention to draw that",00:03:09.480,00:03:11.470
"probability over the
corresponding branch.",00:03:11.470,00:03:15.560
"And the reason why such diagrams
are so useful is",00:03:15.560,00:03:19.440
"because to compute the
probability of a particular",00:03:19.440,00:03:21.980
"outcome, if you've designed your
tree correctly, all you",00:03:21.980,00:03:26.070
"have to do is multiply the
probabilities along the",00:03:26.070,00:03:28.650
"branches that get into
that outcome.",00:03:28.650,00:03:31.980
So let's see that in action.,00:03:31.980,00:03:34.530
"When is a second
round required?",00:03:34.530,00:03:36.800
"Well, a second round is
required here, right?",00:03:36.800,00:03:42.670
"Because in this case, Bo would
be the surviving challenger",00:03:42.670,00:03:45.450
"and he'd play the next
round against Al.",00:03:45.450,00:03:47.730
It's also required here.,00:03:47.730,00:03:50.420
"But of course, it's not required
here or here, because",00:03:50.420,00:03:53.400
no second round is played.,00:03:53.400,00:03:56.100
"And so these two outcomes
comprise the event R2.",00:03:56.100,00:04:01.020
"And now, to get the probability
of this outcome,",00:04:01.020,00:04:05.060
"you multiply along
the branches.",00:04:05.060,00:04:06.790
"So 0.6 times 0.6
give you 0.36.",00:04:06.790,00:04:09.980
"And 0.4 times 0.4
gives you 0.16.",00:04:09.980,00:04:13.770
And we're almost done.,00:04:13.770,00:04:15.360
"We know that these two events
are disjoint, because if Bo",00:04:15.360,00:04:22.040
"won the first two games, then,
certainly, Chi could've won",00:04:22.040,00:04:25.180
the first two games.,00:04:25.180,00:04:27.010
"And so you can just sum the
probabilities to get the",00:04:27.010,00:04:29.800
probability of the reunion.,00:04:29.800,00:04:31.930
"So the probability of R2 is
equal to the probability that",00:04:31.930,00:04:38.070
"Bo won the first two games or
Chi won the first two games.",00:04:38.070,00:04:44.090
"And that's equal to 0.36
plus 0.16, which",00:04:44.090,00:04:49.490
is equal to a 0.52.,00:04:49.490,00:04:52.640
"OK, now the second part
of part a asks for the",00:04:52.640,00:04:57.000
"probability that Bo wins
the first round.",00:04:57.000,00:05:01.260
And this is first round.,00:05:01.260,00:05:04.430
"This is a very straightforward
one.",00:05:04.430,00:05:07.060
"So Bo wins the first round, that
correspondence only to",00:05:07.060,00:05:12.810
this particular outcome.,00:05:12.810,00:05:14.090
"And we already know the
probability associated with",00:05:14.090,00:05:16.440
"that outcome is equal
to the 0.36.",00:05:16.440,00:05:19.760
So we're done with that one.,00:05:19.760,00:05:22.980
"And now the last part is sort
of an interesting one.",00:05:22.980,00:05:26.420
"It asks for the probability
that Al retains his",00:05:26.420,00:05:29.460
championship this year.,00:05:29.460,00:05:30.895
 ,00:05:30.895,00:05:34.010
"So I'm going to just call
that A for short.",00:05:34.010,00:05:36.540
"A is the event that Al retains
his championship this year.",00:05:36.540,00:05:40.300
"And for that we're going to need
a larger tree, because Al",00:05:40.300,00:05:44.200
"has a lot of activity in the
second round, and so far our",00:05:44.200,00:05:47.485
"tree only describes what happens
in the first round.",00:05:47.485,00:05:51.060
"Now, to save time, I've actually
drawn the rest of the",00:05:51.060,00:05:53.870
"tree over there up
in the corner.",00:05:53.870,00:05:57.360
"So let's get rid of
this one and let's",00:05:57.360,00:05:59.410
look at the full tree.,00:05:59.410,00:06:02.050
"So let's see when does Al
retain his championship?",00:06:02.050,00:06:06.320
"Well, Al certainly retains his
championship here, right?",00:06:06.320,00:06:11.900
"Because no second round
is required.",00:06:11.900,00:06:14.020
"Similarly, here.",00:06:14.020,00:06:16.440
"Al retains his championship
here, because the second round",00:06:16.440,00:06:19.480
"was required, but Al beat Bo.",00:06:19.480,00:06:22.940
"And similarly, here Bo didn't
win both games in the second",00:06:22.940,00:06:27.610
"round against Al, so Al wins.",00:06:27.610,00:06:31.490
"Here, Bo is the new
championship.",00:06:31.490,00:06:34.140
"So we don't want to
include about one.",00:06:34.140,00:06:36.230
"And sort of by symmetry,
we also get this",00:06:36.230,00:06:38.440
one and this one.,00:06:38.440,00:06:40.150
"So by my argument before, we
know that the outcomes that",00:06:40.150,00:06:43.610
"comprise our event of interest
are this one, this one, this",00:06:43.610,00:06:47.810
"one, this one, this
one, and this one.",00:06:47.810,00:06:49.680
"So we could multiply the
probabilities along each",00:06:49.680,00:06:52.750
"branch and sum them, because
they're disjoint, to get the",00:06:52.750,00:06:55.910
total probability.,00:06:55.910,00:06:57.390
"But we're not going
to do that because",00:06:57.390,00:06:58.850
that's a lot of algebra.,00:06:58.850,00:07:00.060
"Instead, we're going
to look at the",00:07:00.060,00:07:01.200
complement of the event.,00:07:01.200,00:07:03.170
"So we're going to notice,
there's only two branches on",00:07:03.170,00:07:06.620
"which Al does not retain his
current championship.",00:07:06.620,00:07:10.370
"So P of A is, of course, equal
to 1 minus P of A. And we're",00:07:10.370,00:07:18.160
"going to get P of
A by inspection.",00:07:18.160,00:07:23.120
"I'm sorry, so P of
A compliment.",00:07:23.120,00:07:26.350
"I'm just testing you, guys.",00:07:26.350,00:07:28.290
"So P of A compliment corresponds
to here and to",00:07:28.290,00:07:33.050
"here, because those are the
outcomes where Al didn't win.",00:07:33.050,00:07:37.470
"And so again, you multiply along
the branches to get the",00:07:37.470,00:07:40.130
probabilities.,00:07:40.130,00:07:41.380
"So you get 0.6 squared times 0.5
squared plus 0.4 squared",00:07:41.380,00:07:50.060
times 0.3 squared.,00:07:50.060,00:07:52.830
"And if you do all the algebra,
you should get around 0.8956.",00:07:52.830,00:08:01.640
"So we're cruising through
this problem.",00:08:01.640,00:08:06.140
Let's go to part b.,00:08:06.140,00:08:09.630
"Part b is a little bit less
straightforward than part a,",00:08:09.630,00:08:12.960
"because it starts asking you for
conditional probabilities,",00:08:12.960,00:08:16.660
"as opposed to a priori
probabilities.",00:08:16.660,00:08:20.380
So in the first part--,00:08:20.380,00:08:22.790
"and again, I'm going to continue
my notation with R2--",00:08:22.790,00:08:26.060
"we want the probability that
Bo is the surviving",00:08:26.060,00:08:29.060
challenger--,00:08:29.060,00:08:29.690
"so I'm just going to use
B to denote that--",00:08:29.690,00:08:32.549
given R2.,00:08:32.549,00:08:34.929
"Now, by definition, you should
remember from lecture that",00:08:34.929,00:08:38.240
"this is equal to probability
of B and R2 divided by the",00:08:38.240,00:08:44.970
probability of R2.,00:08:44.970,00:08:48.120
"And of course, we've already
computed this value right up",00:08:48.120,00:08:51.290
here with part a.,00:08:51.290,00:08:52.140
We know it's 2.5.,00:08:52.140,00:08:54.510
"So we don't have to do
any more work there.",00:08:54.510,00:08:56.640
"We only have to look
at the numerator.",00:08:56.640,00:09:01.650
"So we need to go and figure out
what nodes in that tree",00:09:01.650,00:09:05.410
"correspond to the event
B intersect R2.",00:09:05.410,00:09:10.090
So let's use a new color.,00:09:10.090,00:09:13.860
"Let's see, Bo is the surviving
challenger here only, right?",00:09:13.860,00:09:23.450
"And R2 is automatically
satisfied, right?",00:09:23.450,00:09:26.830
"Because a second round is
required there and there, not",00:09:26.830,00:09:33.550
on those two.,00:09:33.550,00:09:34.590
"But here Chi is the surviving
challenger, not Bo, so we're",00:09:34.590,00:09:37.470
"really only interested
in that node.",00:09:37.470,00:09:39.430
"And you multiply along the
branches to get the",00:09:39.430,00:09:41.530
probabilities.,00:09:41.530,00:09:42.910
"So we have 0.36 over
0.52, which is",00:09:42.910,00:09:47.260
approximately equal to 0.6923.,00:09:47.260,00:09:52.240
"OK, now, the next part wants
the conditional probability",00:09:52.240,00:09:58.270
"that AL retains his
championship, conditioned,",00:09:58.270,00:10:01.370
"again, on R2.",00:10:01.370,00:10:03.380
"So we already have A being
the event Al retains his",00:10:03.380,00:10:06.680
championship.,00:10:06.680,00:10:07.750
"So we want the probability
of A, given R2.",00:10:07.750,00:10:12.930
"And let's just apply the
direct definition of",00:10:12.930,00:10:15.920
conditional probability again.,00:10:15.920,00:10:18.140
"You get P of A and R2 divided
by a probability of R2.",00:10:18.140,00:10:25.800
"Of course, we have the
probability of R2 already, so",00:10:25.800,00:10:29.120
"we just need to find the node
in the tree that corresponds",00:10:29.120,00:10:32.490
to A and R2.,00:10:32.490,00:10:35.890
So where is R2?,00:10:35.890,00:10:39.220
"R2 is going to correspond to
every node to the right that",00:10:39.220,00:10:42.810
is not one of these two.,00:10:42.810,00:10:44.730
"So a second round is required
here, here, here,",00:10:44.730,00:10:48.870
"here, here, and here.",00:10:48.870,00:10:50.120
 ,00:10:50.120,00:10:52.710
"Now, where does Al retain
his championship?",00:10:52.710,00:10:54.770
"So Al retains his championship
here.",00:10:54.770,00:10:59.430
"He retains his championship
here.",00:10:59.430,00:11:02.440
"He retains his championship here
and here, but no second",00:11:02.440,00:11:05.070
"round is required, so these
guys don't belong in the",00:11:05.070,00:11:08.650
intersection.,00:11:08.650,00:11:10.310
"But this does, and this does.",00:11:10.310,00:11:13.290
"So we can again multiply the
probabilities along the",00:11:13.290,00:11:17.630
branches and then some them.,00:11:17.630,00:11:20.060
"So let's see, we get--",00:11:20.060,00:11:22.290
"this marker's not working very
well, so I'm going to switch",00:11:22.290,00:11:25.290
back to the pink--,00:11:25.290,00:11:27.270
"so you get 0.6 squared
times 0.5.",00:11:27.270,00:11:32.520
That gets rid of this one.,00:11:32.520,00:11:34.950
"And then we want 0.6 squared
times 0.5 squared.",00:11:34.950,00:11:42.535
That gets rid of that one.,00:11:42.535,00:11:45.320
And then plus--,00:11:45.320,00:11:47.100
let's see--,00:11:47.100,00:11:47.990
"0.4 squared times 0.7, which
takes care of this one.",00:11:47.990,00:11:53.420
"And then lastly, 0.4 squared
times 0.3 times 0.7.",00:11:53.420,00:12:04.650
And that is a long expression.,00:12:04.650,00:12:08.560
"But it happens to
be about 0.7992.",00:12:08.560,00:12:17.860
"OK, so we are done with
part b and we can move",00:12:17.860,00:12:22.620
along to part c.,00:12:22.620,00:12:24.920
"And I am, since we're running
out of room, I'm actually just",00:12:24.920,00:12:30.700
going to erase this.,00:12:30.700,00:12:33.920
"And hopefully you guys
have had a chance to",00:12:33.920,00:12:36.160
copy it down by now.,00:12:36.160,00:12:37.270
"If not, you can always pause
the video and go back.",00:12:37.270,00:12:42.520
"So let's see, part c asks us
given that the second round is",00:12:42.520,00:12:51.480
"required and that it comprised
of one game only.",00:12:51.480,00:12:55.960
"So let's denote I. So let's I
be the event that the second",00:12:55.960,00:13:05.080
round was one game only.,00:13:05.080,00:13:08.030
 ,00:13:08.030,00:13:12.230
"So essentially, in math
conditioned on R2 and I, what",00:13:12.230,00:13:16.520
"is the probability that it was
Bo who won the first round?",00:13:16.520,00:13:20.900
"So let's let B be the event that
Bo won the first round.",00:13:20.900,00:13:27.420
 ,00:13:27.420,00:13:30.850
"OK, so again translating the
English to math, we just want",00:13:30.850,00:13:34.310
"the probability of B given R2
and I. Now, I am once again",00:13:34.310,00:13:44.620
"going to use the definition of
conditional probability.",00:13:44.620,00:13:49.410
"You might be concerned that we
haven't defined explicitly yet",00:13:49.410,00:13:54.890
"the definition of conditional
probability, when what lies",00:13:54.890,00:13:58.460
"behind the conditioning bar is
not a single event, but it's",00:13:58.460,00:14:02.780
"rather an intersection
of an event.",00:14:02.780,00:14:04.980
"And so my claim to you is that
it doesn't matter and that the",00:14:04.980,00:14:09.940
same exact definition applies.,00:14:09.940,00:14:11.480
"But we'll go through
it slowly.",00:14:11.480,00:14:13.380
"So R2 is an event, I is an
event, and we know that the",00:14:13.380,00:14:18.710
"intersection of two events
is itself an event.",00:14:18.710,00:14:21.880
"So I'm going to make up a new
letter, and I'm going to call",00:14:21.880,00:14:25.760
"this event W. So just using
the new notation, this is",00:14:25.760,00:14:33.030
"equal to probability
of B, given W.",00:14:33.030,00:14:37.950
"Now, this is the normal
definition that we know.",00:14:37.950,00:14:40.280
"We know that this is probability
of B intersect W",00:14:40.280,00:14:44.460
"over probability of W. And then
we just resubstitute what",00:14:44.460,00:14:51.120
the definition of W was.,00:14:51.120,00:14:53.710
"And so if you do that over here,
you get probability of B",00:14:53.710,00:14:57.680
"and R2 and I divided by
probability of R2 and I.",00:14:57.680,00:15:06.480
"So hopefully, jumping from here
ahead to here, you see",00:15:06.480,00:15:10.230
"that the definitions act
exactly the same way.",00:15:10.230,00:15:14.170
"But these are two very short
intermediate steps that should",00:15:14.170,00:15:17.570
"help you convince yourself
that the same",00:15:17.570,00:15:21.120
definition still works.,00:15:21.120,00:15:23.880
"So let's start with the
denominator, because the",00:15:23.880,00:15:27.550
"denominator looks a
little bit easier.",00:15:27.550,00:15:30.040
Where is R2 and I in our tree?,00:15:30.040,00:15:34.680
"Well, let's see.",00:15:34.680,00:15:37.530
"Here, a second round was
required, but it",00:15:37.530,00:15:39.970
comprised two games.,00:15:39.970,00:15:41.830
Same with this one.,00:15:41.830,00:15:43.540
"Here, a second round was
required and it was comprised",00:15:43.540,00:15:46.830
only of one game.,00:15:46.830,00:15:48.060
So this is good.,00:15:48.060,00:15:49.132
"This is one of the outcomes
that we're looking for.",00:15:49.132,00:15:53.370
"Here, no second round
was required.",00:15:53.370,00:15:55.410
So this doesn't qualify.,00:15:55.410,00:15:56.590
Same with this one.,00:15:56.590,00:15:58.020
"Here, a second round was
required, and there was only",00:15:58.020,00:16:01.530
"one game, so that's good.",00:16:01.530,00:16:03.430
"And then these don't qualify
for the same reasons",00:16:03.430,00:16:05.810
as we set up there.,00:16:05.810,00:16:07.370
So we just have to multiply the,00:16:07.370,00:16:09.010
probabilities along those branches.,00:16:09.010,00:16:12.800
"And we see that it's 0.4 squared
times 0.7 plus 0.6",00:16:12.800,00:16:18.350
squared times 0.5.,00:16:18.350,00:16:20.680
"OK, we're almost done.",00:16:20.680,00:16:22.200
"We just need to look at the
intersection of R2 and I. So",00:16:22.200,00:16:26.930
"R2 and I are the ones we've
already circled.",00:16:26.930,00:16:29.570
"But now, we want to add one more
constraint, which is that",00:16:29.570,00:16:33.990
"Bo had to have won
the first round.",00:16:33.990,00:16:36.930
"And so we see here that Chi won
the first round, if we're",00:16:36.930,00:16:41.100
looking at this outcome.,00:16:41.100,00:16:42.015
And so he's no good.,00:16:42.015,00:16:44.050
Let's use a different color.,00:16:44.050,00:16:45.960
"Let's see, maybe this one.",00:16:45.960,00:16:47.840
"But here Bo did win
the first round.",00:16:47.840,00:16:51.540
"So we're going to get 0.6
squared times 0.5.",00:16:51.540,00:16:57.160
"And I got that, of course,
just by multiplying the",00:16:57.160,00:16:59.370
"probabilities along the
right branches.",00:16:59.370,00:17:03.180
"And this, if you're curious,
comes out to be about 0.6164.",00:17:03.180,00:17:11.069
"OK, so I know that was a lengthy
problem, but you",00:17:11.069,00:17:15.819
"should feel really comfortable
now doing sort of basic",00:17:15.819,00:17:20.910
probability manipulations.,00:17:20.910,00:17:22.819
"One thing that this problem
emphasized a lot was your",00:17:22.819,00:17:27.109
"ability to compute conditional
probabilities.",00:17:27.109,00:17:30.150
"So you saw me apply the
definition of conditional",00:17:30.150,00:17:33.190
probability twice in part b.,00:17:33.190,00:17:35.550
"And then you saw me apply the
definition again in part c in",00:17:35.550,00:17:39.010
"a sort of slightly
modified way.",00:17:39.010,00:17:42.600
"So that's one thing that
you should have",00:17:42.600,00:17:44.840
gotten out of this problem.,00:17:44.840,00:17:46.340
"And then another thing is that
hopefully, you noticed that by",00:17:46.340,00:17:50.050
"using a tree diagram, we made
the problem much easier.",00:17:50.050,00:17:54.870
"We almost didn't even have
to think about computing",00:17:54.870,00:17:57.210
probabilities anymore.,00:17:57.210,00:17:58.750
"We reduced the problem to just
saying, OK, what are the",00:17:58.750,00:18:02.450
"outcomes that comprise our
event of interest?",00:18:02.450,00:18:06.260
"And then once you select
those, to compute their",00:18:06.260,00:18:08.620
probability you multiply the,00:18:08.620,00:18:10.130
probabilities along the branches.,00:18:10.130,00:18:13.400
"You have the right to just add
those together, because if you",00:18:13.400,00:18:17.100
"draw your tree correctly, all
of these guys should be",00:18:17.100,00:18:21.200
disjoint from one another.,00:18:21.200,00:18:23.200
"So you have to be careful, of
course, to set up your tree",00:18:23.200,00:18:25.970
appropriately.,00:18:25.970,00:18:26.800
"But once you do set up your tree
appropriately, your life",00:18:26.800,00:18:30.670
is much simpler.,00:18:30.670,00:18:32.270
So that's it for today.,00:18:32.270,00:18:33.520
And we'll see you next time.,00:18:33.520,00:18:34.870
 ,00:18:34.870,00:18:36.234
