"PROFESSOR: All right, so
let's begin lecture six.",00:00:21.900,00:00:27.060
"We're talking today about
exponentials and logarithms.",00:00:27.060,00:00:44.630
"And these are the last functions
that I need to introduce,",00:00:44.630,00:00:49.390
"the last standard
functions that we",00:00:49.390,00:00:50.950
"need to connect with calculus,
that you've learned about.",00:00:50.950,00:00:55.110
"And they're certainly as
fundamental, if not more so,",00:00:55.110,00:00:58.230
than trigonometric functions.,00:00:58.230,00:01:00.830
"So first of all, we'll
start out with a number,",00:01:00.830,00:01:04.960
"a, which is positive, which
is usually called a base.",00:01:04.960,00:01:09.030
"And then we have
these properties that",00:01:09.030,00:01:12.790
a to the power 0 is always 1.,00:01:12.790,00:01:14.870
That's how we get started.,00:01:14.870,00:01:17.180
And a^1 is a.,00:01:17.180,00:01:21.270
"And of course a^2,
not surprisingly,",00:01:21.270,00:01:24.030
"is a times a, etc.",00:01:24.030,00:01:26.200
"And the general rule is that
a^(x_1 + x_2) is a^(x_1) times",00:01:26.200,00:01:35.400
a^(x_2).,00:01:35.400,00:01:36.970
"So this is the basic rule of
exponents, and with these two",00:01:36.970,00:01:41.440
"initial properties, that defines
the exponential function.",00:01:41.440,00:01:49.070
"And then there's an
additional property,",00:01:49.070,00:01:52.220
"which is deduced
from these, which",00:01:52.220,00:01:54.360
"is the composition of
exponential functions, which",00:01:54.360,00:01:59.020
"is that you take a to the
x_1 power, to the x_2 power.",00:01:59.020,00:02:03.330
"Then that turns out to be
a to the x_1 times x_2.",00:02:03.330,00:02:08.390
"So that's an additional property
that we'll take for granted,",00:02:08.390,00:02:11.540
"which you learned
in high school.",00:02:11.540,00:02:14.140
"Now, in order to understand
what all the values of a^x are,",00:02:14.140,00:02:22.650
"we need to first remember that
if you're taking a rational",00:02:22.650,00:02:28.620
"power that it's the ratio
of two integers power of a.",00:02:28.620,00:02:34.350
"That's going to be a^m, and
then we're going to have to take",00:02:34.350,00:02:37.190
the nth root of that.,00:02:37.190,00:02:39.440
So that's the definition.,00:02:39.440,00:02:40.840
"And then, when
you're defining a^x,",00:02:40.840,00:02:45.050
"so a^x is defined for
all x by filling in.",00:02:45.050,00:03:00.370
"So I'm gonna use that
expression in quotation marks,",00:03:00.370,00:03:03.480
"""filling in"" by continuity.",00:03:03.480,00:03:09.930
"This is really what
your calculator",00:03:09.930,00:03:11.540
"does when it gives
you a to the power x,",00:03:11.540,00:03:13.960
"because you can't even punch
in the square root of x.",00:03:13.960,00:03:17.540
"It doesn't really exist
on your calculator.",00:03:17.540,00:03:19.590
There's some decimal expansion.,00:03:19.590,00:03:21.230
"So it takes the decimal
expansion to a certain length",00:03:21.230,00:03:24.400
"and spits out a
number which is pretty",00:03:24.400,00:03:26.080
close to the correct answer.,00:03:26.080,00:03:28.120
"But indeed, in theory,
there is an a to the power",00:03:28.120,00:03:31.550
"square root of 2, even
though the square root of 2",00:03:31.550,00:03:33.710
is irrational.,00:03:33.710,00:03:34.740
"And there's a to
the pi and so forth.",00:03:34.740,00:03:37.540
"All right, so that's the
exponential function,",00:03:37.540,00:03:41.000
and let's draw a picture of one.,00:03:41.000,00:03:46.830
"So we'll try, say y = 2^x here.",00:03:46.830,00:03:52.230
"And I'm not going to draw
such a careful graph,",00:03:52.230,00:03:55.180
"but let's just plot the
most important point, which",00:03:55.180,00:03:58.630
"is the point (0,1).",00:03:58.630,00:04:01.360
"That's 2^0, which is 1.",00:04:01.360,00:04:04.510
"And then maybe we'll go
back up here to -1 here.",00:04:04.510,00:04:08.940
"And 2 to the -1 is
this point here.",00:04:08.940,00:04:13.860
"This is (-1, 1/2),
the reciprocal.",00:04:13.860,00:04:18.990
"And over here, we have 1, and so
that goes all the way up to 2.",00:04:18.990,00:04:23.460
"And then exponentials
are remarkably fast.",00:04:23.460,00:04:26.870
"So it's off the board what
happens next out at 2.",00:04:26.870,00:04:30.680
"It's already above
my range here,",00:04:30.680,00:04:34.360
"but the graph looks
something like this.",00:04:34.360,00:04:37.970
All right.,00:04:37.970,00:04:38.610
"Now I've just visually,
at least, graphically",00:04:38.610,00:04:41.200
"filled in all the
rest of the points.",00:04:41.200,00:04:43.240
"You have to imagine all these
rational numbers, and so forth.",00:04:43.240,00:04:46.730
"So this point here
would have been (1, 2).",00:04:46.730,00:04:51.670
And so forth.,00:04:51.670,00:04:53.330
All right?,00:04:53.330,00:04:54.610
So that's not too far along.,00:04:54.610,00:05:00.992
So now what's our goal?,00:05:00.992,00:05:01.950
"Well, obviously we want
to do calculus here.",00:05:01.950,00:05:04.020
"So our goal, here, for now -
and it's gonna take a while.",00:05:04.020,00:05:08.050
"We have to think
about it pretty hard.",00:05:08.050,00:05:10.220
"We have to calculate
what this derivative is.",00:05:10.220,00:05:22.250
"All right, so we'll get started.",00:05:22.250,00:05:26.020
"And the way we get
started is simply",00:05:26.020,00:05:28.520
"by plugging in the
definition of the derivative.",00:05:28.520,00:05:31.190
"The derivative is
the limit as delta",00:05:31.190,00:05:34.760
"x goes to 0 of a to the x plus
delta x, minus a to the x,",00:05:34.760,00:05:41.690
divided by delta x.,00:05:41.690,00:05:45.080
So that's what it is.,00:05:45.080,00:05:50.320
"And now, the only step that
we can really perform here",00:05:50.320,00:05:56.140
"to make this is into
something a little bit simpler",00:05:56.140,00:05:58.790
"is to use this very first
rule that we have here.",00:05:58.790,00:06:03.200
"That the exponential of
the sum is the product",00:06:03.200,00:06:06.930
of the exponentials.,00:06:06.930,00:06:08.070
"So we have here, a^x .",00:06:08.070,00:06:10.340
"So what I want to use is just
the property that a^(x + delta",00:06:10.340,00:06:15.750
x) = a^x a^(delta x).,00:06:15.750,00:06:22.460
"And if I do that, I see that I
can factor out a common factor",00:06:22.460,00:06:26.880
"in the numerator, which is a^x.",00:06:26.880,00:06:29.760
"So we'll write this as the
limit as delta x goes to 0,",00:06:29.760,00:06:35.120
"of a to the x times this ratio,
now a to the delta x, minus 1,",00:06:35.120,00:06:41.300
divided by delta x.,00:06:41.300,00:06:49.280
"So far, so good?",00:06:49.280,00:06:50.160
"We're actually almost to
some serious progress here.",00:06:50.160,00:06:53.640
"So there's one other
important conceptual step",00:06:53.640,00:06:58.460
which we need to understand.,00:06:58.460,00:07:00.100
"And this is a
relatively simple one.",00:07:00.100,00:07:03.010
"We actually did this
before, by the way.",00:07:03.010,00:07:05.340
"We did this with
sines and cosines.",00:07:05.340,00:07:08.162
"The next thing I want
to point out to you",00:07:08.162,00:07:09.870
"is that you're used to thinking
of x as being the variable.",00:07:09.870,00:07:15.680
"And indeed, already
we were discussing",00:07:15.680,00:07:18.140
"x as being the variable
and a as being fixed.",00:07:18.140,00:07:20.130
"But for the purposes
of this limit,",00:07:20.130,00:07:22.220
"there's a different variable
that's moving. x is fixed",00:07:22.220,00:07:26.290
"and delta x is the
thing that's moving.",00:07:26.290,00:07:29.340
"So that means that this factor
here, which is a common factor,",00:07:29.340,00:07:33.440
is constant.,00:07:33.440,00:07:34.799
"And we can just factor
it out of the limit.",00:07:34.799,00:07:36.590
"It doesn't affect
the limit at all.",00:07:36.590,00:07:39.450
"A constant times a
limit is the same",00:07:39.450,00:07:41.130
"as whether we multiply before
or after we take the limit.",00:07:41.130,00:07:44.580
"So I'm just going
to factor that out.",00:07:44.580,00:07:46.830
So that's my next step here.,00:07:46.830,00:07:49.110
"a^x, and then I have the
limit delta x goes to 0",00:07:49.110,00:07:53.450
"of a to the delta x minus
1, divided by delta x.",00:07:53.450,00:07:59.830
All right?,00:07:59.830,00:08:02.180
"And so what I have
here, so this is",00:08:02.180,00:08:03.910
by definition the derivative.,00:08:03.910,00:08:05.220
"So here is d/dx of a^x, and it's
equal to this expression here.",00:08:05.220,00:08:12.730
"Now, I want to stare
at this expression,",00:08:12.730,00:08:17.340
"and see what it's telling
us, because it's telling us",00:08:17.340,00:08:22.880
"as much as we can get
so far, without some--",00:08:22.880,00:08:27.680
"So first let's just
look at what this says.",00:08:27.680,00:08:34.810
"So what it's saying is that the
derivative of a^x is a^x times",00:08:34.810,00:08:40.260
"something that we
don't yet know.",00:08:40.260,00:08:42.820
"And I'm going to call this
something, this mystery number,",00:08:42.820,00:08:46.060
M(a).,00:08:46.060,00:08:47.130
"So I'm gonna make the label,
M(a) is equal to the limit",00:08:47.130,00:08:52.990
"as delta x goes to 0
of a to the delta x",00:08:52.990,00:08:56.640
minus 1 divided by delta x.,00:08:56.640,00:08:59.800
All right?,00:08:59.800,00:09:00.300
So this is a definition.,00:09:00.300,00:09:08.870
"So this mystery number M(a)
has a geometric interpretation,",00:09:08.870,00:09:14.540
as well.,00:09:14.540,00:09:16.000
So let me describe that.,00:09:16.000,00:09:17.554
"It has a geometric
interpretation,",00:09:17.554,00:09:18.970
"and it's a very, very
significant number.",00:09:18.970,00:09:20.678
So let's work out what that is.,00:09:20.678,00:09:22.200
"So first of all, let's rewrite
the expression in the box,",00:09:22.200,00:09:25.690
"using the shorthand
for this number.",00:09:25.690,00:09:28.470
"So if I just rewrite it, it says
d/dx of a^x is equal to this",00:09:28.470,00:09:33.840
"factor, which is
M(a), times a^x.",00:09:33.840,00:09:37.800
"So the derivative of the
exponential is this mystery",00:09:37.800,00:09:43.450
number times a^x.,00:09:43.450,00:09:44.790
"So we've almost solved
the problem of finding",00:09:44.790,00:09:48.870
the derivative of a^x.,00:09:48.870,00:09:50.560
"We just have to figure
out this one number, M(a),",00:09:50.560,00:09:53.270
and we get the rest.,00:09:53.270,00:09:55.720
"So let me point out two more
things about this number, M(a).",00:09:55.720,00:10:01.780
"So first of all,
if I plug in x = 0,",00:10:01.780,00:10:09.350
"that's going to be
d/dx of a^x , at x = 0.",00:10:09.350,00:10:14.250
"According to this formula,
that's M(a) times a^0,",00:10:14.250,00:10:19.150
which of course M(a).,00:10:19.150,00:10:21.370
So what is M(a)?,00:10:21.370,00:10:23.540
"M(a) is the derivative
of this function at 0.",00:10:23.540,00:10:26.410
"So M(a) is the slope of
a^x at x = 0, of the graph.",00:10:26.410,00:10:39.790
The graph of a^x at 0.,00:10:39.790,00:10:41.330
"So again over here, if
you looked at the picture.",00:10:41.330,00:10:46.170
"I'll draw the one
tangent line in here,",00:10:46.170,00:10:48.260
which is this one here.,00:10:48.260,00:10:50.640
"And this thing has slope,
what we're calling M(2).",00:10:50.640,00:11:00.050
"So, if I graph the
function y = 2^x,",00:11:00.050,00:11:02.491
I'll get a certain slope here.,00:11:02.491,00:11:03.740
"If I graph it with
a different base,",00:11:03.740,00:11:05.315
I might get another slope.,00:11:05.315,00:11:07.590
"And what we got so far is
the following phenomenon:",00:11:07.590,00:11:12.820
"if we know this one number, if
we know the slope at this one",00:11:12.820,00:11:16.310
"place, we will be able to figure
out the formula for the slope",00:11:16.310,00:11:18.940
everywhere else.,00:11:18.940,00:11:23.320
"Now, that's actually
exactly the same thing",00:11:23.320,00:11:25.690
"that we did for
sines and cosines.",00:11:25.690,00:11:28.040
"We knew the slope of the
sine and the cosine function",00:11:28.040,00:11:33.120
at x = 0.,00:11:33.120,00:11:35.900
The sine function had slope 1.,00:11:35.900,00:11:37.450
The cosine function had slope 0.,00:11:37.450,00:11:39.470
"And then from the
sum formulas, well",00:11:39.470,00:11:41.560
"that's exactly this
kind of thing here,",00:11:41.560,00:11:44.004
from the sum formulas.,00:11:44.004,00:11:44.920
"This sum formula, in fact
is easier than the ones",00:11:44.920,00:11:47.110
for sines and cosines.,00:11:47.110,00:11:49.320
"From the sum formulas,
we worked out",00:11:49.320,00:11:50.960
what the slope was everywhere.,00:11:50.960,00:11:53.620
"So we're following the same
procedure that we did before.",00:11:53.620,00:11:57.610
But at this point we're stuck.,00:11:57.610,00:12:00.960
"We're stuck, because
that time using radians,",00:12:00.960,00:12:04.660
"this very clever idea
of radians in geometry,",00:12:04.660,00:12:07.140
"we were able to actually
figure out what the slope is.",00:12:07.140,00:12:09.640
"Whereas here, we're not so sure,
what M(2) is, for instance.",00:12:09.640,00:12:14.920
We just don't know yet.,00:12:14.920,00:12:17.200
"So, the basic question that
we have to deal with right now",00:12:17.200,00:12:22.790
is what is M(a)?,00:12:22.790,00:12:32.060
That's what we're left with.,00:12:32.060,00:12:34.680
"And, the curious fact is
that the clever thing to do",00:12:34.680,00:12:42.990
is to beg the question.,00:12:42.990,00:12:51.260
"So we're going to go through
a very circular route here.",00:12:51.260,00:12:54.730
"That is circuitous,
not circular.",00:12:54.730,00:12:56.580
Circular is a bad word in math.,00:12:56.580,00:12:58.360
"That means that one
thing depends on another,",00:12:58.360,00:13:00.380
"and that depends on it,
and maybe both are wrong.",00:13:00.380,00:13:03.220
"Circuitous means, we're going
to be taking a roundabout route.",00:13:03.220,00:13:07.460
"And we're going to discover
that even though we refuse",00:13:07.460,00:13:10.384
"to answer this
question right now,",00:13:10.384,00:13:11.800
"we'll succeed in
answering it eventually.",00:13:11.800,00:13:14.841
All right?,00:13:14.841,00:13:15.340
"So how are we going
to beg the question?",00:13:15.340,00:13:18.340
"What we're going
to say instead is",00:13:18.340,00:13:20.150
"we're going to define a
mystery base, or number e,",00:13:20.150,00:13:30.650
"as the unique number,
so that M(e) = 1.",00:13:30.650,00:13:45.790
"That's the trick that
we're going to use.",00:13:45.790,00:13:47.930
"We don't yet know what e
is, but we're just going",00:13:47.930,00:13:50.610
to suppose that we have it.,00:13:50.610,00:13:53.900
"Now, I'm going to show you a
bunch of consequences of this,",00:13:53.900,00:13:57.340
"and also I have to persuade you
that it actually does exist.",00:13:57.340,00:14:00.540
"So first, let me explain what
the first consequence is.",00:14:00.540,00:14:03.640
"First of all, if M(e)
is 1, then if you",00:14:03.640,00:14:06.670
"look at this formula over here
and you write it down for e,",00:14:06.670,00:14:09.540
"you have something which
is a very usable formula.",00:14:09.540,00:14:13.650
d/dx of e^x is just e^x.,00:14:13.650,00:14:19.930
"All right, so that's an
incredibly important formula",00:14:19.930,00:14:22.750
which is the fundamental one.,00:14:22.750,00:14:24.210
"It's the only one you have to
remember from what we've done.",00:14:24.210,00:14:26.710
"So maybe I should
have highlighted it",00:14:26.710,00:14:28.251
in several colors here.,00:14:28.251,00:14:34.760
That's a big deal.,00:14:34.760,00:14:37.800
Very happy.,00:14:37.800,00:14:40.630
"And again, let me
just emphasize,",00:14:40.630,00:14:42.770
"also that this is the one
which at x = 0 has slope 1.",00:14:42.770,00:14:52.077
"That's the way we
defined it, alright?",00:14:52.077,00:14:53.660
"So if you plug in x = 0 here on
the right hand side, you got 1.",00:14:53.660,00:15:00.640
Slope 1 at x = 0.,00:15:00.640,00:15:03.540
So that's great.,00:15:03.540,00:15:05.580
"Except of course, since
we don't know what e is,",00:15:05.580,00:15:07.980
this is a little bit dicey.,00:15:07.980,00:15:15.770
"So, next even before
explaining what e is...",00:15:15.770,00:15:21.750
"In fact, we won't
get to what e really",00:15:21.750,00:15:23.440
"is until the very
end of this lecture.",00:15:23.440,00:15:26.110
"But I have to persuade
you why e exists.",00:15:26.110,00:15:34.530
"We have to have some
explanation for why",00:15:34.530,00:15:37.406
we know there is such a number.,00:15:37.406,00:15:40.740
"Okay, so first of all, let
me start with the one that we",00:15:40.740,00:15:44.100
"supposedly know, which
is the function 2^x.",00:15:44.100,00:15:46.970
We'll call it f(x) is 2^x.,00:15:46.970,00:15:49.710
All right?,00:15:49.710,00:15:50.460
So that's the first thing.,00:15:50.460,00:15:51.820
"And remember, that the
property that it had,",00:15:51.820,00:15:54.460
was that f'(0) was M(2).,00:15:54.460,00:15:58.170
"That was the derivative of this
function, the slope at x = 0",00:15:58.170,00:16:04.430
of the graph.,00:16:04.430,00:16:06.610
"Of the tangent line, that is.",00:16:06.610,00:16:09.870
"So now, what we're
going to consider",00:16:09.870,00:16:12.980
is any kind of stretching.,00:16:12.980,00:16:16.880
"We're going to stretch this
function by a factor k.",00:16:16.880,00:16:22.750
Any number k.,00:16:22.750,00:16:23.610
"So what we're going
to consider is f(kx).",00:16:23.610,00:16:29.090
"If you do that, that's
the same as 2^(kx).",00:16:29.090,00:16:34.790
Right?,00:16:34.790,00:16:37.420
"But now if I use the second law
of exponents that I have over",00:16:37.420,00:16:41.030
"there, that's the same thing
as 2 to the k to the power x,",00:16:41.030,00:16:46.700
"which is the same
thing as some base b^x,",00:16:46.700,00:16:51.110
"where b is equal to-- Let's
write that down over here.",00:16:51.110,00:16:55.420
b is 2^k.,00:16:55.420,00:16:55.940
Right.,00:16:59.081,00:16:59.580
"So whatever it is, if I have
a different base which is",00:16:59.580,00:17:03.630
"expressed in terms of
2, of the form 2^k,",00:17:03.630,00:17:07.740
"then that new function is
described by this function",00:17:07.740,00:17:14.110
"f(kx), the stretch.",00:17:14.110,00:17:17.700
"So what happens when
you stretch a function?",00:17:17.700,00:17:20.730
"That's the same thing
as shrinking the x axis.",00:17:20.730,00:17:24.720
"So when k gets larger, this
corresponding point over here",00:17:24.720,00:17:30.035
"would be over here, and so
this corresponding point",00:17:30.035,00:17:32.160
would be over here.,00:17:32.160,00:17:32.990
"So you shrink this picture,
and the slope here tilts up.",00:17:32.990,00:17:38.910
"So, as we increase k, the
slope gets steeper and steeper.",00:17:38.910,00:17:43.140
"Let's see that explicitly,
numerically, here.",00:17:43.140,00:17:47.570
"Explicitly, numerically, if
I take the derivative here...",00:17:47.570,00:17:51.870
"So the derivative with
respect to x of b^x,",00:17:51.870,00:17:56.580
"that's the chain rule, right?",00:17:56.580,00:18:00.944
"That's the derivative
with respect",00:18:00.944,00:18:02.360
"to x of f(kx), which is what?",00:18:02.360,00:18:08.260
It's k times f'(kx).,00:18:08.260,00:18:11.780
"And so if we do it at 0,
we're just getting k times",00:18:11.780,00:18:20.850
"f'(0), which is k
times this M(2).",00:18:20.850,00:18:26.570
"So how is it exactly that
we cook up the right base b?",00:18:26.570,00:18:31.390
"So b = e when k =
1 over this number.",00:18:31.390,00:18:40.260
"In other words, we can pick all
possible slopes that we want.",00:18:40.260,00:18:44.279
"This just has the effect
of multiplying the slope",00:18:44.279,00:18:46.320
by a factor.,00:18:46.320,00:18:47.550
"And we can shift the slope
at 0 however we want,",00:18:47.550,00:18:50.130
"and we're going to do it so
that the slope exactly matches",00:18:50.130,00:18:56.240
"1, the one that we want.",00:18:56.240,00:18:58.150
We still don't know what k is.,00:18:58.150,00:18:59.580
We still don't know what e is.,00:18:59.580,00:19:01.340
"But at least we know that
it's there somewhere.",00:19:01.340,00:19:04.940
Yes?,00:19:04.940,00:19:05.640
"Student: How do you
know it's f(kx)?",00:19:05.640,00:19:08.299
PROFESSOR: How do I know?,00:19:08.299,00:19:09.340
"Well, f(x) is 2^x.",00:19:09.340,00:19:13.440
"If f(x) is 2^x, then the
formula for f(kx) is this.",00:19:13.440,00:19:19.160
"I've decided what f(x)
is, so therefore there's",00:19:19.160,00:19:23.060
a formula for f(kx).,00:19:23.060,00:19:25.120
"And furthermore,
by the chain rule,",00:19:25.120,00:19:26.609
"there's a formula
for the derivative.",00:19:26.609,00:19:28.150
"And it's k times
the derivative of f.",00:19:28.150,00:19:33.930
"So again, scaling does this.",00:19:33.930,00:19:35.150
"By the way, we did
exactly the same thing",00:19:35.150,00:19:37.890
"with the sine and
cosine function.",00:19:37.890,00:19:39.920
"If you think of
the sine function",00:19:39.920,00:19:41.650
"here, let me just
remind you here,",00:19:41.650,00:19:44.660
"what happens with
the chain rule,",00:19:44.660,00:19:46.310
you get k times cosine k t here.,00:19:46.310,00:19:51.720
"So the fact that we set things
up beautifully with radians",00:19:51.720,00:19:55.340
"that this thing is, but we could
change the scale to anything,",00:19:55.340,00:19:58.650
"such as degrees, by the
appropriate factor k.",00:19:58.650,00:20:02.340
"And then there would be
this scale factor shift",00:20:02.340,00:20:05.320
of the derivative formulas.,00:20:05.320,00:20:07.500
"Of course, the one with
radians is the easy one,",00:20:07.500,00:20:09.500
because the factor is 1.,00:20:09.500,00:20:11.130
"The one with
degrees is horrible,",00:20:11.130,00:20:13.850
"because the factor is some
crazy number like 180 over pi,",00:20:13.850,00:20:20.085
or something like that.,00:20:20.085,00:20:22.410
"Okay, so there's
something going on here",00:20:22.410,00:20:25.880
"which is exactly the same
as that kind of re-scaling.",00:20:25.880,00:20:30.420
"So, so far we've got only one
formula which is a keeper here.",00:20:30.420,00:20:37.040
This one.,00:20:37.040,00:20:38.810
"We have a preliminary
formula that we still",00:20:38.810,00:20:40.870
"haven't completely
explained which",00:20:40.870,00:20:42.510
has a little wavy line there.,00:20:42.510,00:20:45.820
"And we have to fit all
these things together.",00:20:45.820,00:20:49.260
"Okay, so now to
fit them together,",00:20:49.260,00:20:52.260
"I need to introduce
the natural log.",00:20:52.260,00:21:11.450
"So the natural log is
denoted this way, ln(x).",00:21:11.450,00:21:21.590
"So maybe I'll call
it a new letter name,",00:21:21.590,00:21:24.570
we'll call it w = ln x here.,00:21:24.570,00:21:28.470
"But if we were reversing
things, if we started out with",00:21:28.470,00:21:32.040
"a function y = e^x , the
property that it would have is",00:21:32.040,00:21:37.880
"that it's the inverse
function of e^x.",00:21:37.880,00:21:41.030
"So it has the property that
the log of y is equal to x.",00:21:41.030,00:21:45.870
Right?,00:21:45.870,00:21:46.370
So this defines the log.,00:21:46.370,00:21:58.910
"Now the logarithm has
a bunch of properties",00:21:58.910,00:22:01.790
"and they come from the
exponential properties",00:22:01.790,00:22:04.270
in principle.,00:22:04.270,00:22:04.940
You remember these.,00:22:04.940,00:22:07.500
"And I'm just going to
remind you of them.",00:22:07.500,00:22:10.379
"So the main one that I
just want to remind you of",00:22:10.379,00:22:12.420
"is that the logarithm
of x_1 * x_2",00:22:12.420,00:22:21.100
"is equal to the logarithm of
x_1 plus the logarithm of x_2.",00:22:21.100,00:22:28.130
"And maybe a few more are
worth reminding you of.",00:22:28.130,00:22:32.170
"One is that the
logarithm of 1 is 0.",00:22:32.170,00:22:37.120
"A second is that the
logarithm of e is 1.",00:22:37.120,00:22:43.310
All right?,00:22:43.310,00:22:43.840
"So these correspond to the
inverse relationships here.",00:22:43.840,00:22:47.160
"If I plug in here,
x = 0 and x = 1.",00:22:47.160,00:22:51.170
"If I plug in x = 0 and x = 1,
I get the corresponding numbers",00:22:51.170,00:22:56.650
here: y = 1 and y = e.,00:22:56.650,00:23:04.030
"And maybe it would be worth
it to plot the picture once",00:23:04.030,00:23:10.430
to reinforce this.,00:23:10.430,00:23:13.430
"So here I'll put them
on the same chart.",00:23:13.430,00:23:16.620
If you have here e^x over here.,00:23:16.620,00:23:20.200
It looks like this.,00:23:20.200,00:23:21.790
"Then the logarithm which I'll
maybe put in a different color.",00:23:21.790,00:23:28.610
"So this crosses at this
all-important point",00:23:28.610,00:23:31.120
"here, (0,1).",00:23:31.120,00:23:32.700
"And now in order to figure out
what the inverse function is,",00:23:32.700,00:23:35.260
"I have to take the flip
across the diagonal x = y.",00:23:35.260,00:23:40.750
"So that's this shape here,
going down like this.",00:23:40.750,00:23:44.600
"And here's the point (1, 0).",00:23:44.600,00:23:47.090
"So (1, 0) corresponds
to this identity here.",00:23:47.090,00:23:50.700
But the log of 1 is 0.,00:23:50.700,00:23:53.000
"And notice, so this is
ln x, the graph of ln x.",00:23:53.000,00:24:00.120
"And notice it's only
defined for x positive,",00:24:00.120,00:24:05.680
"which corresponds to the fact
that e^x is always positive.",00:24:05.680,00:24:09.570
"So in other words, this white
curve is only above this axis,",00:24:09.570,00:24:15.130
"and the orange one
is to the right here.",00:24:15.130,00:24:19.210
"It's only defined
for x positive.",00:24:19.210,00:24:27.990
"Oh, one other thing I should
mention is the slope here is 1.",00:24:27.990,00:24:31.740
"And so the slope there
is also going to be 1.",00:24:31.740,00:24:35.380
"Now, what we're allowed to do
relatively easily, because we",00:24:35.380,00:24:41.180
"have the tools to do it, is
to compute the derivative",00:24:41.180,00:24:44.470
of the logarithm.,00:24:44.470,00:24:49.960
"So to find the
derivative of a log,",00:24:49.960,00:24:59.090
"we're going to use
implicit differentiation.",00:24:59.090,00:25:04.060
"This is how we
find the derivative",00:25:04.060,00:25:08.250
of any inverse function.,00:25:08.250,00:25:09.806
"So remember the
way that works is",00:25:09.806,00:25:11.180
"if you know the derivative
of the function,",00:25:11.180,00:25:12.971
"you can find the derivative
of the inverse function.",00:25:12.971,00:25:15.590
"And the mechanism
is the following:",00:25:15.590,00:25:18.280
you write down here w = ln x.,00:25:18.280,00:25:22.677
Here's the function.,00:25:22.677,00:25:23.510
"We're trying to find
the derivative of w.",00:25:23.510,00:25:25.510
"But now we don't know how to
differentiate this equation,",00:25:25.510,00:25:28.750
"but if we exponentiate it, so
that's the same thing as e^w =",00:25:28.750,00:25:38.200
x.,00:25:38.200,00:25:42.660
"Because let's just
stick this in here.",00:25:42.660,00:25:46.420
e^(ln x) = x.,00:25:46.420,00:25:52.330
Now we can differentiate this.,00:25:52.330,00:25:54.680
"So let's do the
differentiation here.",00:25:54.680,00:25:56.800
"We have d/dx e^w is equal
to d/dx x, which is 1.",00:25:56.800,00:26:04.010
"And then this, by
the chain rule,",00:26:04.010,00:26:06.030
is d/dw of e^w times dw/dx.,00:26:06.030,00:26:11.450
"The product of
these two factors.",00:26:11.450,00:26:14.560
That's equal to 1.,00:26:14.560,00:26:15.580
"And now this guy,
the one little guy",00:26:15.580,00:26:18.680
"that we actually know and can
use, that's this guy here.",00:26:18.680,00:26:27.980
"So this is e^w times
dw/dx, which is 1.",00:26:27.980,00:26:33.800
"And so finally,
dw/dx = 1 / e^w .",00:26:33.800,00:26:44.730
But what is that?,00:26:44.730,00:26:47.080
It's x.,00:26:47.080,00:26:48.250
So this is 1/x.,00:26:48.250,00:26:50.740
"So what we discovered
is, and now I",00:26:50.740,00:26:53.140
"get to put another
green guy around here,",00:26:53.140,00:26:57.000
is that this is equal to 1/x.,00:26:57.000,00:27:01.870
"So alright, now we have two
companion formulas here.",00:27:01.870,00:27:16.710
"The rate of change
of ln x is 1/x.",00:27:16.710,00:27:20.210
"And the rate of change
of e^x is itself, is e^x.",00:27:20.210,00:27:24.830
"And it's time to
return to the problem",00:27:24.830,00:27:30.729
"that we were having a
little bit of trouble with,",00:27:30.729,00:27:32.770
"which is somewhat not explicit,
which is this M(a) times x.",00:27:32.770,00:27:37.690
"We want to now differentiate
a^x in general, not just e^x .",00:27:37.690,00:27:44.090
"So let's work that
out, and I want",00:27:44.090,00:27:47.140
"to explain it in
a couple of ways,",00:27:47.140,00:27:50.732
"so you're going to
have to remember this,",00:27:50.732,00:27:52.440
because I'm going to erase it.,00:27:52.440,00:27:55.530
"But what I'd like you
to do is, so now I",00:27:55.530,00:28:01.780
"want to teach you
how to differentiate",00:28:01.780,00:28:03.570
basically any exponential.,00:28:03.570,00:28:17.530
"So now to differentiate
any exponential.",00:28:17.530,00:28:31.580
There are two methods.,00:28:31.580,00:28:37.941
"They're practically
the same method.",00:28:37.941,00:28:39.440
"They have the same
amount of arithmetic.",00:28:39.440,00:28:41.480
"You'll see both of them, and
they're equally valuable.",00:28:41.480,00:28:45.610
"So we're going to
just describe them.",00:28:45.610,00:28:48.150
"Method one I'm going to
illustrate on the function a^x.",00:28:48.150,00:28:55.940
"So we're interested
in differentiating",00:28:55.940,00:29:00.020
"this thing, exactly this problem
that I still didn't solve yet.",00:29:00.020,00:29:04.280
Okay?,00:29:04.280,00:29:05.080
So here it is.,00:29:05.080,00:29:06.950
And here's the procedure.,00:29:06.950,00:29:08.080
"The procedure is to write, so
the method is to use base e,",00:29:08.080,00:29:17.190
or convert to base e.,00:29:17.190,00:29:20.350
So how do you convert to base e?,00:29:20.350,00:29:22.430
"Well, you write a^x
as e to some power.",00:29:22.430,00:29:27.660
So what power is it?,00:29:27.660,00:29:29.020
"It's e to the power
ln a, to the power x.",00:29:29.020,00:29:34.980
And that is just e^(x ln a).,00:29:34.980,00:29:40.730
"So we've made our
conversion now to base e.",00:29:40.730,00:29:44.870
The exponential of something.,00:29:44.870,00:29:46.810
"So now I'm going to carry
out the differentiation.",00:29:46.810,00:29:50.410
"So d/dx of a^x is equal
to d/dx of e^(x ln a).",00:29:50.410,00:29:59.270
"And now, this is a step which
causes great confusion when",00:29:59.270,00:30:05.970
you first see it.,00:30:05.970,00:30:06.870
"And you must get used to it,
because it's easy, not hard.",00:30:06.870,00:30:10.920
Okay?,00:30:10.920,00:30:13.450
"The rate of change of
this with respect to x is,",00:30:13.450,00:30:18.660
let me do it by analogy here.,00:30:18.660,00:30:23.040
"Because say I had e^(3x) and
I were differentiating it.",00:30:23.040,00:30:27.520
"The chain rule would
say that this is just 3,",00:30:27.520,00:30:31.600
"the rate of change of 3x with
respect to x times e^(3x).",00:30:31.600,00:30:36.330
"The rate of change of e to
the u with respect to u.",00:30:36.330,00:30:41.060
"So this is the
ordinary chain rule.",00:30:41.060,00:30:43.500
"And what we're doing up here
is exactly the same thing,",00:30:43.500,00:30:47.610
"because ln a, as
frightening as it",00:30:47.610,00:30:50.270
"looks, with all three letters
there, is just a fixed number.",00:30:50.270,00:30:54.690
It's not moving.,00:30:54.690,00:30:55.860
It's a constant.,00:30:55.860,00:30:57.170
"So the constant just
accelerates the rate of change",00:30:57.170,00:31:01.080
"by that factor, which is
what the chain rule is doing.",00:31:01.080,00:31:04.980
"So this is equal to
ln a times e^(x ln a).",00:31:04.980,00:31:11.830
"Same business here
with ln a replacing 3.",00:31:11.830,00:31:17.390
"So this is something you've
got to get used to in time",00:31:17.390,00:31:19.790
"for the exam, for instance,
because you're going",00:31:19.790,00:31:21.789
to be doing a million of these.,00:31:21.789,00:31:25.360
So do get used to it.,00:31:25.360,00:31:27.810
So here's the formula.,00:31:27.810,00:31:29.230
"On the other hand, this
expression here was the same",00:31:29.230,00:31:33.770
as a^x.,00:31:33.770,00:31:34.730
"So another way of writing this,
and I'll put this into a box,",00:31:34.730,00:31:39.200
"but actually I never
remember this particularly.",00:31:39.200,00:31:41.790
"I just re-derive it every time,
is that the derivative of a^x",00:31:41.790,00:31:48.650
is equal to (ln a) a^x .,00:31:48.650,00:31:51.100
"Now I'm going to get rid
of what's underneath it.",00:31:51.100,00:31:56.930
So this is another formula.,00:31:56.930,00:32:01.970
"So there's the formula I've
essentially finished here.",00:32:01.970,00:32:05.500
"And notice, what is
the magic number?",00:32:05.500,00:32:11.190
"The magic number is
the natural log of a.",00:32:11.190,00:32:16.089
That's what it was.,00:32:16.089,00:32:16.880
"We didn't know what
it was in advance.",00:32:16.880,00:32:18.679
This is what it is.,00:32:18.679,00:32:19.470
It's the natural log of a.,00:32:19.470,00:32:21.450
"Let me emphasize to you
again, something about what's",00:32:21.450,00:32:26.740
"going on here, which has
to do with scale change.",00:32:26.740,00:32:34.510
"So, for example, the derivative
with respect to x of 2^x is (ln",00:32:34.510,00:32:44.290
2) 2^x.,00:32:44.290,00:32:47.290
"The derivative
with respect to x,",00:32:47.290,00:32:49.080
"these are the two most obvious
bases that you might want",00:32:49.080,00:32:51.730
"to use, is ln 10 times 10^x .",00:32:51.730,00:32:56.760
"So one of the things that's
natural about the natural",00:32:56.760,00:32:59.470
"logarithm is that
even if we insisted",00:32:59.470,00:33:02.860
"that we must use base 2, or
that we must use base 10,",00:33:02.860,00:33:07.410
"we'd still be stuck
with natural logarithms.",00:33:07.410,00:33:11.360
They come up naturally.,00:33:11.360,00:33:12.540
"They're the ones
which are independent",00:33:12.540,00:33:14.780
"of our human construct
of base 2 and base 10.",00:33:14.780,00:33:20.079
"The natural logarithm
is the one that",00:33:20.079,00:33:21.620
comes up without reference.,00:33:21.620,00:33:25.360
"And we'll be mentioning
a few other ways",00:33:25.360,00:33:27.210
in which it's natural later.,00:33:27.210,00:33:31.110
"So I told you about
this first method,",00:33:31.110,00:33:34.750
"now I want to tell you
about a second method here.",00:33:34.750,00:33:41.730
"So the second is called
logarithmic differentiation.",00:33:41.730,00:34:05.700
So how does this work?,00:34:05.700,00:34:07.770
"Well, sometimes
you're having trouble",00:34:07.770,00:34:10.930
"differentiating a
function, and it's easier",00:34:10.930,00:34:17.640
to differentiate its logarithm.,00:34:17.640,00:34:21.780
"That may seem peculiar,
but actually we'll",00:34:21.780,00:34:23.830
"give several examples where
this is clearly the case,",00:34:23.830,00:34:26.640
"that the logarithm is
easier to differentiate",00:34:26.640,00:34:28.560
than the function.,00:34:28.560,00:34:30.830
"So it could be that this is an
easier quantity to understand.",00:34:30.830,00:34:34.090
"So we want to relate it
back to the function u.",00:34:34.090,00:34:39.470
"So I'm going to write it
a slightly different way.",00:34:39.470,00:34:44.170
"Let's write it in
terms of primes here.",00:34:44.170,00:34:47.270
"So the basic identity
is the chain rule again,",00:34:47.270,00:34:51.060
"and the derivative
of the logarithm,",00:34:51.060,00:34:52.730
"well maybe I'll write
it out this way first.",00:34:52.730,00:34:54.920
"So this would be d ln
u / du, times d/dx u.",00:34:54.920,00:35:01.720
These are the two factors.,00:35:05.120,00:35:10.110
"And that's the same
thing, so remember",00:35:10.110,00:35:12.040
"what the derivative
of the logarithm is.",00:35:12.040,00:35:14.140
This is 1/u.,00:35:14.140,00:35:17.820
"So here I have a 1/u,
and here I have a du/dx.",00:35:17.820,00:35:23.570
"So I'm going to encode this
on the next board here,",00:35:23.570,00:35:28.850
"which is sort of the main
formula you always need",00:35:28.850,00:35:31.290
"to remember, which is
that (ln u)' = u' / u.",00:35:31.290,00:35:39.530
That's the one to remember here.,00:35:39.530,00:35:42.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].,00:35:42.610,00:35:47.320
"PROFESSOR: The question is
how did I get this step here?",00:35:47.320,00:35:51.870
So this is the chain rule.,00:35:51.870,00:35:58.500
"The rate of change of
ln u with respect to x",00:35:58.500,00:36:02.150
"is the rate of change
of ln u with respect u,",00:36:02.150,00:36:04.610
"times the rate of change
of u with respect to x.",00:36:04.610,00:36:07.730
That's the chain rule.,00:36:07.730,00:36:18.560
"So now I've worked out
this identity here,",00:36:18.560,00:36:22.840
"and now let's show how it
handles this case, d/dx a^x.",00:36:22.840,00:36:30.730
Let's do this one.,00:36:30.730,00:36:31.740
"So in order to get that
one, I would take u = a^x .",00:36:31.740,00:36:39.570
"And now let's just take a look
at what ln u is. ln u = x ln a.",00:36:39.570,00:36:51.460
"Now I claim that this is
pretty easy to differentiate.",00:36:51.460,00:36:55.010
"Again, it may seem hard, but
it's actually quite easy.",00:36:55.010,00:37:00.200
"So maybe somebody
can hazard a guess.",00:37:00.200,00:37:04.590
What's the derivative of x ln a?,00:37:04.590,00:37:11.530
It's just ln a.,00:37:11.530,00:37:14.870
"So this is the same thing that I
was talking about before, which",00:37:14.870,00:37:18.400
"is if you've got 3x,
and you're taking",00:37:18.400,00:37:21.420
"its derivative with respect
to x here, that's just 3.",00:37:21.420,00:37:24.804
"That's the kind
of thing you have.",00:37:24.804,00:37:26.220
"Again, don't be put off by this
massive piece of junk here.",00:37:26.220,00:37:30.110
It's a constant.,00:37:30.110,00:37:33.260
"So again, keep that in mind.",00:37:33.260,00:37:38.220
"It comes up regularly in
this kind of question.",00:37:38.220,00:37:42.460
"So there's our formula, that the
logarithmic derivative is this.",00:37:42.460,00:37:46.980
But let's just rewrite that.,00:37:46.980,00:37:50.360
"That's the same thing as u' / u,
which is (ln u)' = ln a, right?",00:37:50.360,00:37:58.600
"So this is our
differentiation formula.",00:37:58.600,00:38:00.610
So here we have u'.,00:38:00.610,00:38:01.800
"u' is equal to u times ln a, if
I just multiply through by u.",00:38:01.800,00:38:07.460
And that's what we wanted.,00:38:07.460,00:38:08.630
"That's d/dx a^x is equal to
ln a (I'll reverse the order",00:38:08.630,00:38:16.660
"of the two, which is
customary) times a^x.",00:38:16.660,00:38:24.640
"So this is the way that
logarithmic differentiation",00:38:24.640,00:38:27.390
works.,00:38:27.390,00:38:27.890
"It's the same arithmetic
as the previous method,",00:38:27.890,00:38:32.680
"but we don't have to
convert to base e.",00:38:32.680,00:38:34.930
"We're just keeping
track of the exponents",00:38:34.930,00:38:37.829
"and doing differentiation
on the exponents,",00:38:37.829,00:38:39.620
"and multiplying
through at the end.",00:38:39.620,00:38:44.330
"Okay, so I'm going to do
two trickier examples, which",00:38:44.330,00:38:49.660
"illustrate logarithmic
differentiation.",00:38:49.660,00:39:02.400
"Again, these could be done
equally well by using base e,",00:39:02.400,00:39:06.490
but I won't do it.,00:39:06.490,00:39:07.730
"Method one and method
two always both work.",00:39:07.730,00:39:12.120
"So here's a second
example: again this",00:39:12.120,00:39:15.780
"is a problem when you
have moving exponents.",00:39:15.780,00:39:23.220
"But this time, we're going
to complicate matters",00:39:23.220,00:39:25.900
"by having both a moving
exponent and a moving base.",00:39:25.900,00:39:30.520
"So we have a function u, which
is, well maybe I'll call it v,",00:39:30.520,00:39:34.710
"since we already had a
function u, which is x^x.",00:39:34.710,00:39:38.640
"A really complicated
looking function here.",00:39:38.640,00:39:41.670
"So again you can handle
this by converting",00:39:41.670,00:39:44.490
"to base e, method one.",00:39:44.490,00:39:47.220
"But we'll do the logarithmic
differentiation version,",00:39:47.220,00:39:49.750
alright?,00:39:49.750,00:39:51.110
"So I take the logs
of both sides.",00:39:51.110,00:39:59.310
And now I differentiate it.,00:39:59.310,00:40:04.370
"And now when I
differentiate this here,",00:40:04.370,00:40:06.200
I have to use the product rule.,00:40:06.200,00:40:07.654
"This time, instead of
having ln a, a constant,",00:40:07.654,00:40:09.570
I have a variable here.,00:40:09.570,00:40:10.980
So I have two factors.,00:40:10.980,00:40:12.660
"I have ln x when I
differentiate with respect to x.",00:40:12.660,00:40:15.416
"When I differentiate with
respect to this factor here,",00:40:15.416,00:40:19.410
"I get that x times the
derivative of that,",00:40:19.410,00:40:21.800
which is 1/x.,00:40:21.800,00:40:26.910
"So, here's my formula.",00:40:26.910,00:40:29.160
Almost finished.,00:40:29.160,00:40:30.430
"So I have here v' / v. I'm going
to multiply these two things",00:40:30.430,00:40:34.701
together.,00:40:34.701,00:40:35.200
"I'll put it on the other side,
because I don't want to get it",00:40:35.200,00:40:37.741
"mixed up with
ln(x+1), the quantity.",00:40:37.741,00:40:45.340
And now I'm almost done.,00:40:45.340,00:40:47.100
"I have v' = v (1 + ln x), and
that's just d/dx x^x = x^x (1 +",00:40:47.100,00:41:02.110
ln x).,00:41:02.110,00:41:04.310
That's it.,00:41:04.310,00:41:13.450
"So these two methods always
work for moving exponents.",00:41:13.450,00:41:31.989
"So the next thing
that I'd like to do",00:41:31.989,00:41:33.530
"is another fairly
tricky example.",00:41:33.530,00:41:36.220
"And this one is not strictly
speaking within calculus.",00:41:36.220,00:41:45.880
"Although we're going to use the
tools that we just described",00:41:45.880,00:41:48.800
"to carry it out, in fact
it will use some calculus",00:41:48.800,00:41:52.820
in the very end.,00:41:52.820,00:41:55.990
"And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to evaluate the limit",00:41:55.990,00:41:59.530
"as n goes to infinity
of (1 + 1/n)^n.",00:41:59.530,00:42:02.020
"So now, the reason why I want
to discuss this is, is it",00:42:11.430,00:42:16.170
"turns out to have a
very interesting answer.",00:42:16.170,00:42:18.460
"And it's a problem that
you can approach exactly",00:42:18.460,00:42:23.520
by this method.,00:42:23.520,00:42:24.490
"And the reason is that
it has a moving exponent.",00:42:24.490,00:42:28.580
The exponent n here is changing.,00:42:28.580,00:42:30.840
"And so if you want to keep track
of that, a good way to do that",00:42:30.840,00:42:33.570
is to use logarithms.,00:42:33.570,00:42:36.740
"So in order to figure
out this limit,",00:42:36.740,00:42:38.550
"we're going to
take the log of it",00:42:38.550,00:42:40.040
"and figure out what
the limit of the log",00:42:40.040,00:42:41.775
"is, instead of the
log of the limit.",00:42:41.775,00:42:43.280
Those will be the same thing.,00:42:43.280,00:42:44.990
"So we're going to take the
natural log of this quantity",00:42:44.990,00:42:48.850
"here, and that's n ln(1 + 1/n).",00:42:48.850,00:42:56.200
"And now I'm going
to rewrite this",00:43:02.640,00:43:06.370
"in a form which will make
it more recognizable,",00:43:06.370,00:43:10.960
"so what I'd like to do
is I'm going to write n,",00:43:10.960,00:43:20.040
"or maybe I should say it this
way: delta x is equal to 1/n.",00:43:20.040,00:43:24.730
"So if n is going to
infinity, then this delta x",00:43:24.730,00:43:29.880
is going to be going to 0.,00:43:29.880,00:43:33.700
"So this is more familiar
territory for us in this class,",00:43:33.700,00:43:37.500
anyway.,00:43:37.500,00:43:38.560
So let's rewrite it.,00:43:38.560,00:43:40.370
"So here, we have 1 over delta x.",00:43:40.370,00:43:42.980
"And then that is multiplied
by ln(1 + delta x).",00:43:42.980,00:43:46.680
"So n is the
reciprocal of delta x.",00:43:50.150,00:43:54.860
"Now I want to change this
in a very, very minor way.",00:43:54.860,00:43:58.330
I'm going to subtract 0 from it.,00:43:58.330,00:44:01.150
So that's the same thing.,00:44:01.150,00:44:02.470
"So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to subtract ln 1 from it.",00:44:02.470,00:44:06.420
That's just equal to 0.,00:44:06.420,00:44:08.260
"So this is not a
problem, and I'll",00:44:08.260,00:44:10.210
put some parentheses around it.,00:44:10.210,00:44:14.800
"Now you're supposed to
recognize, all of a sudden,",00:44:14.800,00:44:18.080
what pattern this fits into.,00:44:18.080,00:44:21.280
"This is the thing which we
need to calculate in order",00:44:21.280,00:44:25.570
"to calculate the derivative
of the log function.",00:44:25.570,00:44:30.810
"So this is, in
the limit as delta",00:44:30.810,00:44:33.540
"x goes to 0, equal to
the derivative of ln x.",00:44:33.540,00:44:39.300
Where?,00:44:39.300,00:44:39.890
Well the base point is x=1.,00:44:39.890,00:44:43.940
"That's where we're
evaluating it.",00:44:43.940,00:44:45.710
That's the x_0.,00:44:45.710,00:44:46.730
That's the base value.,00:44:46.730,00:44:49.380
"So this is the
difference quotient.",00:44:49.380,00:44:51.000
That's exactly what it is.,00:44:51.000,00:44:52.430
"And so this by definition
tends to the limit here.",00:44:52.430,00:44:57.630
"But we know what the derivative
of the log function is.",00:44:57.630,00:45:01.470
"The derivative of the
log function is 1/x.",00:45:01.470,00:45:03.520
So this limit is 1.,00:45:09.110,00:45:17.470
So we got it.,00:45:17.470,00:45:18.500
We got the limit.,00:45:18.500,00:45:19.730
"And now we just have
to work backwards",00:45:19.730,00:45:22.050
"to figure out what this limit
that we've got over here is.",00:45:22.050,00:45:34.010
So let's do that.,00:45:34.010,00:45:37.130
So let's see here.,00:45:37.130,00:45:38.260
The log approached 1.,00:45:38.260,00:45:40.570
"So the limit as n goes to
infinity of (1 + 1/n)^n.",00:45:40.570,00:45:45.960
"So sorry, the log of this.",00:45:49.530,00:45:51.880
"Yeah, let's write it this way.",00:45:51.880,00:45:54.320
"It's the same thing, as
well, the thing that we know",00:45:54.320,00:45:57.530
is the log of this.,00:45:57.530,00:46:00.610
1 plus 1 over n to the n.,00:46:00.610,00:46:04.700
And goes to infinity.,00:46:04.700,00:46:06.390
"That's the one that
we just figured out.",00:46:06.390,00:46:08.190
"But now this thing is
the exponential of that.",00:46:08.190,00:46:11.380
"So it's really e
to this power here.",00:46:11.380,00:46:16.550
"So this guy is the
same as the limit",00:46:16.550,00:46:19.060
"of the log of the limit of the
thing, which is the same as log",00:46:19.060,00:46:21.799
of the limit.,00:46:21.799,00:46:22.340
"The limit of the log and the
log of the limit are the same.",00:46:22.340,00:46:25.268
log lim equals lim log.,00:46:25.268,00:46:32.260
"Okay, so I take
the logarithm, then",00:46:32.260,00:46:33.754
"I'm going to take
the exponential.",00:46:33.754,00:46:35.170
"That just undoes
what I did before.",00:46:35.170,00:46:37.800
"And so this limit is
just 1, so this is e^1.",00:46:37.800,00:46:41.910
"And so the limit that we
want here is equal to e.",00:46:41.910,00:46:52.000
"So I claim that with this
step, we've actually closed",00:46:52.000,00:46:56.790
"the loop, finally.",00:46:56.790,00:46:58.270
"Because we have an honest
numerical way to calculate e.",00:46:58.270,00:47:03.620
The first.,00:47:03.620,00:47:04.140
There are many such.,00:47:04.140,00:47:05.400
"But this one is a perfectly
honest numerical way",00:47:05.400,00:47:07.640
to calculate e.,00:47:07.640,00:47:08.680
We had this thing.,00:47:08.680,00:47:09.950
"We didn't know
exactly what it was.",00:47:09.950,00:47:12.170
"It was this M(e), there was
M(a), the logarithm, and so on.",00:47:12.170,00:47:14.872
We have all that stuff.,00:47:14.872,00:47:15.830
"But we really need to nail
down what this number e is.",00:47:15.830,00:47:18.920
"And this is telling
us, if you take",00:47:18.920,00:47:20.920
"for example 1 plus 1 over 100
to the 100th power, that's",00:47:20.920,00:47:25.620
"going to be a very good,
perfectly decent anyway,",00:47:25.620,00:47:28.910
approximation to e.,00:47:28.910,00:47:30.730
"So this is a numerical
approximation,",00:47:30.730,00:47:36.330
"which is all we can
ever do with just",00:47:36.330,00:47:39.320
this kind of irrational number.,00:47:39.320,00:47:42.700
"And so that closes
the loop, and we now",00:47:42.700,00:47:46.270
"have a coherent
family of functions,",00:47:46.270,00:47:49.452
"which are actually well
defined and for which we have",00:47:49.452,00:47:51.660
practical methods to calculate.,00:47:51.660,00:47:54.550
"Okay, see you next time.",00:47:54.550,00:47:56.312
