start with problems.",00:00:21.544,00:00:23.460
"And as we find concept issues,
we'll get to concept issues.",00:00:23.460,00:00:29.414
"So, we talked about
shortest-path,",00:00:29.414,00:00:30.830

about shortest-path",00:00:30.830,00:00:32.390
"in a very odd way, right?",00:00:32.390,00:00:34.730

learned some analysis tricks",00:00:49.650,00:00:52.090

"Let's build one right
now, how about that?",00:01:39.820,00:01:42.940

edges and all the edges",00:02:18.200,00:02:24.690

The structure?,00:03:00.850,00:03:02.020
No.,00:03:02.020,00:03:03.670
"Klaus mentioned Dijkstra
and mentioned Bellman-Ford.",00:03:03.670,00:03:08.340
Let's write them up here.,00:03:08.340,00:03:09.490
"And they gave us
the running times,",00:03:15.110,00:03:17.100
"which we'll try to
remember in a bit.",00:03:17.100,00:03:19.250
"But, we don't know algorithms,
so no Dijkstra, no Bellman-Ford",00:03:19.250,00:03:24.160
for us.,00:03:24.160,00:03:27.000
What do we know?,00:03:27.000,00:03:29.780
Let's start with a simpler case.,00:03:29.780,00:03:31.890
"What if there are
no weights here.",00:03:31.890,00:03:33.430
"What if the graph
looked like this.",00:03:33.430,00:03:35.050
You're making my life hard.,00:03:42.460,00:03:43.600
Like this.,00:03:49.050,00:03:51.090
No costs.,00:03:51.090,00:03:51.870
"All the edges have
the same costs.",00:03:51.870,00:03:54.607

solve the problem?",00:03:54.607,00:03:56.190
"Say we want the shortest
path from A to E.",00:03:58.740,00:04:06.790
AUDIENCE: BFS.,00:04:06.790,00:04:08.330
PROFESSOR: BFS.,00:04:08.330,00:04:10.400
"How's everyone
feeling about BFS?",00:04:10.400,00:04:11.800
"What does BFS do,
really quickly?",00:04:15.150,00:04:16.899
How do you run BFS?,00:04:19.579,00:04:21.080
"AUDIENCE: Take a starting
node and then you",00:04:21.080,00:04:23.103
can search all it's neighbors.,00:04:23.103,00:04:24.580
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:04:24.580,00:04:25.730
Pick a starting node.,00:04:25.730,00:04:27.590
"Then, look at its neighbors?",00:04:27.590,00:04:30.410
"AUDIENCE: And then you enter it
through each of its neighbors",00:04:30.410,00:04:33.290
"to find its neighbors
and so forth.",00:04:33.290,00:04:36.940
"PROFESSOR: Sounds an
awful lot like BFS.",00:04:36.940,00:04:39.222
"What's the difference
between them?",00:04:39.222,00:04:40.680
"AUDIENCE: Well, you go
through all of these neighbors",00:04:40.680,00:04:43.720
"before you start going
through any of it.",00:04:43.720,00:04:45.650
"I mean, you go through
all As neighbors",00:04:45.650,00:04:47.280
"before you take
a neighbor and go",00:04:47.280,00:04:48.402
through all of its neighbors.,00:04:48.402,00:04:49.700
"PROFESSOR: Ok, that's
the difference.",00:04:49.700,00:04:51.560
"And it makes a huge
difference as we've",00:04:51.560,00:04:53.250
"seen in topological
sorting last time.",00:04:53.250,00:04:55.490
"So we have a list
and we're going",00:04:55.490,00:04:57.990
"to use it to keep track of the
nodes that we need to visit.",00:04:57.990,00:05:01.070
"We start with A. We numerate
all of As neighbors.",00:05:01.070,00:05:05.460
"And the ones that
haven't been seen",00:05:05.460,00:05:08.510
"get stuck at the
end of the list.",00:05:08.510,00:05:10.580
"A, B, C. A is out of the list.",00:05:10.580,00:05:13.690
"Then we take out the first node
from the list, B in this case.",00:05:13.690,00:05:19.230
"We numerate all its neighbors,
A, C, D, E. Out of all these,",00:05:19.230,00:05:24.260
"we take the neighbors
that we haven't seen",00:05:24.260,00:05:26.075
"and we put them at
the end of the list.",00:05:26.075,00:05:27.700
"take out C, we look
at its neighbors.",00:05:32.460,00:05:34.330
We've seen them.,00:05:34.330,00:05:35.040
"We take out D, we
look at his neighbors.",00:05:35.040,00:05:36.790
We've seen them.,00:05:36.790,00:05:37.350
"We take out E, we look
at all its neighbors.",00:05:37.350,00:05:39.183
We've seen them.,00:05:39.183,00:05:40.040
So this is BFS.,00:05:40.040,00:05:43.060
BFS has this concept of levels.,00:05:43.060,00:05:44.830
"And another way to look at
levels is, if you start at A,",00:05:44.830,00:05:48.890
"and you draw a
circus of radius one,",00:05:48.890,00:05:52.670
"it's going to have all the nodes
that are distance 1 from 8.",00:05:52.670,00:05:55.561
Right?,00:05:55.561,00:05:56.060
Exactly one edge.,00:05:56.060,00:05:58.080
"Then you draw a
circus of radius 2",00:05:58.080,00:06:01.790
"and you get all the nodes that
you can reach in two edges.",00:06:01.790,00:06:06.550
"And BFS calls these
circles levels.",00:06:06.550,00:06:10.630
A is at level 0.,00:06:10.630,00:06:11.940
This is level 1.,00:06:11.940,00:06:13.590
This is level 2.,00:06:13.590,00:06:15.860
"If you look at this list and
you write down the levels,",00:06:15.860,00:06:18.710
"you have 0, 1, 1, 2, 2.",00:06:18.710,00:06:21.860
"If you had another
node out here, say F,",00:06:21.860,00:06:26.610
"this would be
discovered when we get",00:06:26.610,00:06:28.630
"to D. It would go all
the way here at the end,",00:06:28.630,00:06:33.200
and this is level 3.,00:06:33.200,00:06:34.900
"In BFS the levels are
always increasing.",00:06:34.900,00:06:38.480
"If you keep track
of parent pointers,",00:06:38.480,00:06:40.950
"the parent pointer of
a node, at some level,",00:06:40.950,00:06:43.900
"will always point to a
node at the previous level.",00:06:43.900,00:06:47.490
"So, in BFS we get the shortest
paths in terms of edge count.",00:06:47.490,00:06:51.770
Make sense?,00:06:55.310,00:06:56.240
"This is a recall, right?",00:06:56.240,00:06:57.240
It is not new stuff.,00:06:57.240,00:06:58.580
Everyone happy with it?,00:06:58.580,00:07:01.350
"If it wouldn't have
costs, we could",00:07:01.350,00:07:02.850
"use BFS to compute
shortest paths.",00:07:02.850,00:07:06.750
"But, we have costs.",00:07:06.750,00:07:09.006
How do we deal with that?,00:07:09.006,00:07:12.160
"Intuitively, I'd like to
make BFS go across this edge",00:07:12.160,00:07:15.950
"faster than it would
go across the edge.",00:07:15.950,00:07:19.260
"If I could do that, if this guy
could get stuck in the queue",00:07:19.260,00:07:21.930
"before this guy,
I would be happy.",00:07:21.930,00:07:24.750
"Intuitively, that's
what I'd like to do.",00:07:24.750,00:07:27.090
How do we do that?,00:07:27.090,00:07:29.648
AUDIENCE: Sort before adding?,00:07:29.648,00:07:32.812
PROFESSOR: Sort--,00:07:32.812,00:07:33.520
"AUDIENCE: Sort your
neighbors sorts.",00:07:33.520,00:07:35.800
PROFESSOR: Sort?,00:07:35.800,00:07:36.850
OK.,00:07:36.850,00:07:39.110
"AUDIENCE: What if you kept
track of it in a menu?",00:07:39.110,00:07:41.960
"Kept track of your queue
as a priority queue.",00:07:41.960,00:07:45.830
PROFESSOR: Congratulations.,00:07:45.830,00:07:46.955
You deserve a Turing Award.,00:07:46.955,00:07:48.300
You have discovered Dijkstra.,00:07:48.300,00:07:49.510
"OK, let's go for
something simpler.",00:07:53.240,00:07:55.410
I just say this is Dijkstra.,00:07:55.410,00:07:57.160
"We'll talk about it
in lecture on Tuesday.",00:07:57.160,00:07:59.350
Very good.,00:07:59.350,00:08:02.270
"AUDIENCE: Like, have
an adjacency list",00:08:02.270,00:08:03.932
"and, I think using what he said.",00:08:03.932,00:08:06.824
Just sort it by cost--,00:08:06.824,00:08:10.500
"PROFESSOR: OK, let's
see how this would work.",00:08:10.500,00:08:12.490
"We have A, and we're
pulling A out of the list.",00:08:12.490,00:08:18.510
"And we see its neighbors
are C and B. Right?",00:08:18.510,00:08:22.250
The distance to C is 2.,00:08:22.250,00:08:23.610
The distance to B is 4.,00:08:23.610,00:08:25.660
"So we start with
A. Does this mean",00:08:25.660,00:08:29.580
"that I'm going to
put in B before C?",00:08:29.580,00:08:32.419
"I'm going to put
in C and then B?",00:08:32.419,00:08:34.537
"AUDIENCE: No, it
doesn't really matter",00:08:34.537,00:08:36.872
"because at the end you
just sort the part.",00:08:36.872,00:08:38.740
"I guess you could
add in the costs.",00:08:38.740,00:08:41.954
"Like associate the
costs of B with 4",00:08:41.954,00:08:44.049
"and C with 2 within
your adjacency list?",00:08:44.049,00:08:48.009
"PROFESSOR: So, that's how we
would keep track of costs,",00:08:48.009,00:08:50.300
right?,00:08:50.300,00:08:50.690
One way.,00:08:50.690,00:08:51.280
"AUDIENCE: --for the
queue would be A",00:08:51.280,00:08:52.274
"and then the value would be like
a [INAUDIBLE] B and its cost,",00:08:52.274,00:08:54.857
"and the [INAUDIBLE]
C and its cost.",00:08:54.857,00:08:57.620
"PROFESSOR: So you're saying that
what I would have in this list",00:08:57.620,00:09:00.530
is B with a cost of 4?,00:09:00.530,00:09:05.020
And C with a cost of 2?,00:09:05.020,00:09:09.150
"Presumably, the other
way around, right?",00:09:09.150,00:09:12.610
C goes first?,00:09:12.610,00:09:13.265
Like This?,00:09:20.890,00:09:22.440
"And then I take out C, I explore
the neighbors so and so forth?",00:09:22.440,00:09:26.220
"The moment I did this I
already lost the battle.",00:09:26.220,00:09:28.770
"Because, see this path
A, C, B, length 3?",00:09:28.770,00:09:36.760
"If I put both of
them in the queue,",00:09:36.760,00:09:38.660
"then the parent pointers
are going to look like this.",00:09:38.660,00:09:41.700
"So, I already have a
bad path from B to A.",00:09:41.700,00:09:44.271
"AUDIENCE: OK, well don't
add that node then.",00:09:44.271,00:09:46.920
"PROFESSOR: OK, then
how do we do it?",00:09:46.920,00:09:48.755
"AUDIENCE: I guess you
can talk to each of them",00:09:48.755,00:09:52.635
"and see which one's
lower and then, only",00:09:52.635,00:09:54.490
add that one if it's the lowest.,00:09:54.490,00:09:56.850
"So it's more like
depth search then--",00:09:56.850,00:09:58.500
"PROFESSOR: Well, you two
need to talk together",00:09:58.500,00:10:00.416
"because you're getting
to Dijkstra, too.",00:10:00.416,00:10:02.530
"You're both going to
rediscover Dijkstra.",00:10:02.530,00:10:06.120
"So that's great, but I'm
looking for something simple.",00:10:06.120,00:10:09.370
This is too complicated.,00:10:09.370,00:10:10.940
"If you're going to
do Dijkstra now, then",00:10:10.940,00:10:12.740
"what are going to do
on lecture on Tuesday?",00:10:12.740,00:10:14.697
"AUDIENCE: More
Dijkstra problems?",00:10:14.697,00:10:17.557
"PROFESSOR: Well, I think Shreeny
wants to talk about Dijkstra,",00:10:17.557,00:10:20.140
so let's not get there.,00:10:20.140,00:10:21.280
"AUDIENCE: How do you do
this without doing Dijkstra?",00:10:21.280,00:10:24.514
PROFESSOR: Good.,00:10:24.514,00:10:25.180
"That's exactly what
I want to know.",00:10:25.180,00:10:27.150
[LAUGHTER],00:10:27.150,00:10:29.970
"So, let me give
you another hint.",00:10:29.970,00:10:31.791
"The first hint was that I
want to go through this edge",00:10:31.791,00:10:34.040
"faster than I would
go through this edge.",00:10:34.040,00:10:36.380
"The other hint is that we're
allowed to change the graph.",00:10:36.380,00:10:40.744
"AUDIENCE: Is this what we
talked about in lecture,",00:10:40.744,00:10:43.380
"or are we thinking
of something else?",00:10:43.380,00:10:46.491
"PROFESSOR: He might
have talked about that",00:10:46.491,00:10:48.240
at the end of lecture.,00:10:48.240,00:10:51.610
"AUDIENCE: Were you
putting the current weight",00:10:51.610,00:10:54.960
"for each node
inside the circles?",00:10:54.960,00:10:58.390
PROFESSOR: No.,00:10:58.390,00:11:01.330
"AUDIENCE: You could
add it and then",00:11:01.330,00:11:02.800
"if you could find
a better path to B?",00:11:02.800,00:11:05.740
"With rows relative
to A, then you",00:11:05.740,00:11:07.620
could just delete that path?,00:11:07.620,00:11:09.500
And B to 4?,00:11:09.500,00:11:10.626
"So at the beginning you
add them all, but then--",00:11:10.626,00:11:12.626
"PROFESSOR: You're risking to
have exponential running time.",00:11:12.626,00:11:15.312
AUDIENCE: (LAUGHS),00:11:15.312,00:11:18.357
"PROFESSOR: Those are
all valid optimizations",00:11:18.357,00:11:20.190
under some constraints.,00:11:20.190,00:11:21.570
"Like, this one's good if you
don't have too much memory,",00:11:21.570,00:11:24.250
but the time goes up.,00:11:24.250,00:11:27.730
"I want my graph to have
edges with no costs,",00:11:27.730,00:11:30.810
"because if I have costs,
this is not going to work.",00:11:30.810,00:11:34.250
BFS is not going to work.,00:11:34.250,00:11:36.950
We can't tweak it.,00:11:36.950,00:11:37.700
"If you could tweak it then that
would be another Turing Award.",00:11:37.700,00:11:41.110
"AUDIENCE: So,
create dummy nodes?",00:11:41.110,00:11:42.561
PROFESSOR: Create dummy nodes.,00:11:42.561,00:11:43.810
How do I do that?,00:11:43.810,00:11:46.930
"AUDIENCE:Put a band of
node in between A and C?",00:11:46.930,00:11:49.780
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:11:49.780,00:11:50.480
Why am I doing this?,00:11:50.480,00:11:51.390
"So now I have two edges
and they have costs.",00:11:56.510,00:11:59.710
AUDIENCE: One.,00:11:59.710,00:12:00.600
"Then you put three nodes
in between A and B.",00:12:00.600,00:12:03.092
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:12:03.092,00:12:03.675
"And now here I have
four edges, right?",00:12:07.120,00:12:10.980
"1, 1, 1, 1.",00:12:10.980,00:12:12.990
"There was a 4 here before and
there was a 2 here before.",00:12:12.990,00:12:17.990
"Do you guys see
what's happening?",00:12:17.990,00:12:20.040
"So, instead of one edge
of cost C, I have C edges.",00:12:20.040,00:12:24.520
"So, now BFS is going to take C
steps to go through that edge.",00:12:24.520,00:12:31.010
"And all the edges now
have the same cost.",00:12:31.010,00:12:33.230
"This looks like a problem
that BFS can solve.",00:12:33.230,00:12:35.275
We know it can solve.,00:12:35.275,00:12:36.150
We proved that it can solve it.,00:12:36.150,00:12:37.930
"Well, CLRS did.",00:12:37.930,00:12:39.260
"We take their word
for granted, sort of.",00:12:39.260,00:12:41.140
This works right?,00:12:45.140,00:12:46.977
Is everyone happy with it?,00:12:46.977,00:12:48.060
Does it make sense?,00:12:48.060,00:12:49.770
"AUDIENCE: So basically,
we get through C",00:12:49.770,00:12:55.160
"before you'll get to
B on the other path.",00:12:55.160,00:12:57.250
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:12:57.250,00:12:58.000
"This is the path of
length 3, so this node",00:12:58.000,00:13:00.230
"is going to get in
the queue first.",00:13:00.230,00:13:02.730
Then this node.,00:13:02.730,00:13:03.610
Then these two nodes.,00:13:03.610,00:13:04.980
"And they're going to
get in the queue from C.",00:13:04.980,00:13:09.970
Let's see what happened here.,00:13:09.970,00:13:12.620
"This is really
important because this",00:13:12.620,00:13:14.440
"is what you're going to
be doing in real life.",00:13:14.440,00:13:17.170
"Chances of having to
build a new algorithm?",00:13:17.170,00:13:20.000
Kind of slim.,00:13:20.000,00:13:20.700
Why don't you want to do that?,00:13:20.700,00:13:22.250
"Say you take Dijkstra and
you tweak it a little bit.",00:13:22.250,00:13:25.240
"If you did that, you have
to go through the analysis",00:13:25.240,00:13:27.910
"and prove the
running time again,",00:13:27.910,00:13:29.320
prove the correctness again.,00:13:29.320,00:13:30.800
"Time-consuming, error-prone,
it's really hard.",00:13:30.800,00:13:35.090
"However, what happened
here is that we",00:13:35.090,00:13:37.380
"have some problem
that we want to solve.",00:13:37.380,00:13:39.880
"Say we have the raw
input for that problem",00:13:39.880,00:13:41.630
that we're trying to solve.,00:13:41.630,00:13:44.910
"That is this graph
that I draw the board.",00:13:44.910,00:13:48.365
"And we apply some
transform and we",00:13:51.740,00:13:54.890
"get an input that's
suitable for an algorithm",00:13:54.890,00:13:57.120
that we already know.,00:13:57.120,00:13:58.080
"I'm going to take
a shortcut here.",00:14:05.670,00:14:07.460
"We apply the transform, right?",00:14:13.120,00:14:14.870
"We took this graph and
we built a new graph in.",00:14:14.870,00:14:17.550
And this is hopefully easy.,00:14:17.550,00:14:19.740
Right?,00:14:19.740,00:14:20.720
Take an edge and split it up.,00:14:20.720,00:14:22.320
Put in fake nodes.,00:14:22.320,00:14:23.070
This is easy.,00:14:23.070,00:14:23.840
We know how to code that.,00:14:23.840,00:14:26.410
"And now we have this algorithm
that you already know,",00:14:26.410,00:14:28.676
"and we're treating
it like a black box.",00:14:28.676,00:14:30.300
We know it's correct.,00:14:33.180,00:14:34.187
We know it's running time.,00:14:34.187,00:14:35.270
We're not questioning them.,00:14:35.270,00:14:36.290
"We're taking them straight
from the textbook.",00:14:36.290,00:14:37.910
They have to be right.,00:14:37.910,00:14:38.780
"By the way, what's the
running time of BFS?",00:14:38.780,00:14:40.571
AUDIENCE: V plus E?,00:14:48.620,00:14:49.426
PROFESSOR: Very good.,00:14:49.426,00:14:50.300
"Then BFS is going to
give us a path, right?",00:14:55.050,00:14:57.110
"And the path is going
to look like this.",00:14:57.110,00:14:58.830
"It's going to be
A, fake node, C, D,",00:14:58.830,00:15:07.700
"fake node, E. If you're giving
this back to the guy who",00:15:07.700,00:15:13.112
"gave you the problem,
they're going to be like,",00:15:13.112,00:15:15.070
what are these fake nodes?,00:15:15.070,00:15:16.210
"I don't know
anything about them.",00:15:16.210,00:15:17.770
This doesn't make sense.,00:15:17.770,00:15:19.320
"You need to take this
raw output and you",00:15:19.320,00:15:23.940
need to transform it again.,00:15:23.940,00:15:25.280
"Based on what you did
this transformation,",00:15:25.280,00:15:28.110
you have to read out the output.,00:15:28.110,00:15:29.510
You have to interpret it.,00:15:29.510,00:15:31.110
"So, this is either
interpret or readout.",00:15:31.110,00:15:33.970
"And then you get a
nice output that's",00:15:33.970,00:15:38.230
"the output to your
original problem.",00:15:38.230,00:15:40.700
"This process here is
the most likely way",00:15:43.280,00:15:47.490
"in which you'll use
your 6006 knowledge.",00:15:47.490,00:15:50.110
"And this is replaced by any
algorithm that we taught.",00:15:50.110,00:15:53.460
"This is replaced by
any real life problem",00:15:53.460,00:15:55.319
that you'll encounter.,00:15:55.319,00:15:56.235
There's one missing step here.,00:16:01.580,00:16:02.844
"We know the running
time for this.",00:16:02.844,00:16:04.260
"Let's find out the running
time for the whole thing.",00:16:04.260,00:16:08.650
"In order to do that,
we have to figure out",00:16:08.650,00:16:11.220
given this original graph.,00:16:11.220,00:16:13.390
"Let's say that now,
in the original graph,",00:16:13.390,00:16:15.180
"we have V prime vertices,
E prime edges, and W",00:16:15.180,00:16:18.220
prime weights.,00:16:18.220,00:16:20.760
"We have to convert
this into V plus E.",00:16:20.760,00:16:24.100
"We have to see when we make this
transform, how many vertices",00:16:24.100,00:16:26.800
do we get?,00:16:26.800,00:16:27.300
"How many edges do we get in
terms of the original graph",00:16:27.300,00:16:30.262
"so that we can compute
the running time?",00:16:30.262,00:16:31.928
"In the original graph, V
prime vertices, E prime edges,",00:16:34.530,00:16:38.670
W prime weights.,00:16:38.670,00:16:40.180
"In this new graph, how many
edges do I have, at most?",00:16:40.180,00:16:43.540
AUDIENCE: Something times E?,00:16:51.014,00:16:52.246
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:16:52.246,00:16:52.870
Perfect.,00:16:52.870,00:16:53.369
"Each edge has cost
at most W. That",00:16:57.410,00:17:00.100
"means we're going to split
it up into most W edges.",00:17:00.100,00:17:04.361
"How many vertices
are we going to have?",00:17:04.361,00:17:06.166
AUDIENCE: W prime?,00:17:14.462,00:17:16.920
"PROFESSOR: W prime, E prime.",00:17:16.920,00:17:19.510
AUDIENCE: Plus V prime?,00:17:19.510,00:17:20.776
PROFESSOR: Plus V prime.,00:17:20.776,00:17:21.776
"Don't forget about
the original ones.",00:17:21.776,00:17:23.349
They're still there.,00:17:23.349,00:17:25.640
"So, total running time for
BFS on this new graph is?",00:17:25.640,00:17:29.875
AUDIENCE: --E prime.,00:17:37.778,00:17:40.200
"PROFESSOR: Put it the other way
around, plus W prime, E prime.",00:17:40.200,00:17:44.610
"This is the running
time that we have.",00:17:48.240,00:17:50.340
"Now, does anyone remember
Dijkstra's running time",00:17:50.340,00:17:53.300
and Bellam-Ford's running time?,00:17:53.300,00:17:55.060
"So what is the running
time for Dijkstra?",00:17:58.870,00:18:00.623
AUDIENCE: V log V plus E?,00:18:00.623,00:18:04.970
PROFESSOR: Almost.,00:18:04.970,00:18:06.593
AUDIENCE: V log V?,00:18:06.593,00:18:07.980
"PROFESSOR: Oh, wait.",00:18:07.980,00:18:09.002
I think you're right.,00:18:09.002,00:18:10.850
V log V plus--,00:18:10.850,00:18:14.451
AUDIENCE: E?,00:18:14.451,00:18:16.840
"PROFESSOR: I already
named this from CRS?",00:18:16.840,00:18:19.680
Or is this what we got?,00:18:19.680,00:18:20.670
"Entry is a fancy key to
give this running time.",00:18:23.630,00:18:25.646
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:18:25.646,00:18:26.845
"PROFESSOR: You can get this, but
you need the really fancy data",00:18:26.845,00:18:29.470
structure for it.,00:18:29.470,00:18:30.720
"In real life, the running
time looks more like E log V.",00:18:30.720,00:18:36.980
And how about Bellam-Ford?,00:18:36.980,00:18:38.160
"So let's take this
running time for Dijkstra",00:18:49.970,00:18:52.226
"because this is
what you're going",00:18:52.226,00:18:53.600
to implement in real life.,00:18:53.600,00:18:54.929
"And we can argue about that
after next lecture for now.",00:18:54.929,00:18:57.220
Take my word for it.,00:18:57.220,00:18:58.760
"And let's compare it
to what we got here.",00:18:58.760,00:19:02.480
"V is smaller than E
in most same cases.",00:19:02.480,00:19:05.990
"Let's say that this is
actually W prime, E prime.",00:19:05.990,00:19:09.450
"If you compare this
with this, you'll",00:19:09.450,00:19:12.630
"see that, if W is smaller than
log V, well, smaller equal,",00:19:12.630,00:19:18.820
"then this algorithm is
not worse than Dijkstra.",00:19:18.820,00:19:22.420
It's on par with Dijkstra.,00:19:22.420,00:19:25.440
"For graphs with small costs,
we discovered an algorithm",00:19:25.440,00:19:28.760
that solves shortest paths.,00:19:28.760,00:19:30.720
"You walked into this
recitation knowing no algorithm",00:19:30.720,00:19:33.380
to solve shortest path.,00:19:33.380,00:19:35.060
Now we have an algorithm.,00:19:35.060,00:19:36.440
"Already in a much
better position.",00:19:36.440,00:19:38.480
Right?,00:19:38.480,00:19:39.030
"And we didn't
invent anything new.",00:19:39.030,00:19:40.620
"We don't have to
prove correctness.",00:19:40.620,00:19:42.420

these transformations.",00:19:42.420,00:19:46.490
How's everyone feeling?,00:19:46.490,00:19:49.589
Those things makes sense?,00:19:49.589,00:19:50.630
Everyone happy?,00:19:50.630,00:19:51.370
"Let's talk about another problem
that also uses this structure.",00:19:54.770,00:20:00.025
"Suppose we have the
same graph that we",00:20:10.037,00:20:11.620
"had before, or actually, any
graph with V vertices, E edges.",00:20:11.620,00:20:17.040
"Now we know how to
compute shortest paths.",00:20:17.040,00:20:18.910
"So we can assume
these as black boxes.",00:20:18.910,00:20:22.250
"We're going to use
these as they are.",00:20:26.620,00:20:29.150

the highway system,",00:20:55.660,00:20:57.720
"right, like in Google Maps.",00:20:57.720,00:20:59.700

"They start off from

They're going to drive together.,00:21:05.290,00:21:07.520
"They want this to
be sort of fair.",00:21:07.520,00:21:10.330
"Every time they go
between two cities",00:21:10.330,00:21:12.240
"they're going to switch
seats so that none of them",00:21:12.240,00:21:14.950
drives too much.,00:21:14.950,00:21:16.330
"So say the brothers
are Tim and Jim.",00:21:16.330,00:21:21.357
The names are wrong.,00:21:21.357,00:21:22.190
"This is actually a problem
from last year's quiz.",00:21:22.190,00:21:25.420
"So, by the way, real problem.",00:21:25.420,00:21:26.700
You can pay attention now.,00:21:26.700,00:21:30.100
These are two brothers.,00:21:30.100,00:21:32.700
They're going to alternate.,00:21:32.700,00:21:34.010
Right?,00:21:34.010,00:21:34.510
"One of them is going to
drive across one road,",00:21:34.510,00:21:36.691
"then the other one, then the
first one, then the second one.",00:21:36.691,00:21:39.190
So on and so forth.,00:21:39.190,00:21:40.970
"Now, two Tim has a much better
sense of direction than Jim.",00:21:40.970,00:21:45.950
That's just how things are.,00:21:45.950,00:21:47.450
"And if you ever
driven long distances,",00:21:47.450,00:21:50.880
"the hardest thing to do
is to get from the city",00:21:50.880,00:21:53.310
to the highway.,00:21:53.310,00:21:54.379
"Like, if you have to drive
from here to New York.",00:21:54.379,00:21:56.420

"Get out of Boston
and onto the highway.",00:21:57.410,00:21:59.800

Everything else?,00:22:05.630,00:22:06.420

both of these situations.",00:22:08.890,00:22:13.055

with Tim and must end with Tim.",00:22:13.055,00:22:17.220

they're going to crash.",00:22:17.220,00:22:19.260
"First off let's convert
this into graph terms.",00:22:21.850,00:22:24.730

what's already in the graph.",00:22:29.619,00:22:31.952

this constraint",00:22:34.620,00:22:36.150

seats and that Tim has to start",00:22:36.150,00:22:39.989

where in the graph.",00:22:54.621,00:22:56.370

Jim has to-- whoever",00:23:07.658,00:23:13.488

OK.,00:23:20.220,00:23:21.552

like an odd number of edges.",00:23:21.552,00:23:24.710

with an odd number of edges.",00:23:25.890,00:23:29.060
Why odd number of edges?,00:23:29.060,00:23:30.490
"If we look at the edges, Tim's
going to take the first one.",00:23:30.490,00:23:33.620

Jim, then Tim, then Jim.",00:23:33.620,00:23:37.210
"No matter how many I have
here, it has to end with Tim.",00:23:37.210,00:23:40.410

odd number of letters here,",00:23:40.410,00:23:42.710
"therefore, odd number of edges.",00:23:42.710,00:23:44.460
Right?,00:23:44.460,00:23:44.960
"So I want the shortest path
that has an odd number of edges.",00:23:44.960,00:23:51.730
"And as the hint we're going
to use that trick over there.",00:23:58.570,00:24:02.140
Yes?,00:24:02.140,00:24:02.760
"AUDIENCE: But, the shortest
path isn't necessarily",00:24:02.760,00:24:05.596
"like the fairest, right?",00:24:05.596,00:24:07.093
"Like, in terms of
distributing driving?",00:24:07.093,00:24:11.090

going to drive one more road,",00:24:11.090,00:24:13.680

in terms of the weights?",00:24:21.992,00:24:24.450
"PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.",00:24:24.450,00:24:25.283

he's going anyways.",00:24:27.680,00:24:29.522

have to have like three paths,",00:24:29.522,00:24:31.980
right?,00:24:31.980,00:24:33.117
"We don't just want Tim
to get out to the highway",00:24:33.117,00:24:35.117
"and be like, oh look our
journey's not that far--",00:24:35.117,00:24:37.158

path with the smallest cost.",00:24:39.650,00:24:42.940

could be length, too.",00:24:45.787,00:24:47.620

"PROFESSOR: Well, if
it's length, too,",00:24:48.530,00:24:50.071

for two consecutive edges.",00:24:56.592,00:24:58.800

to the end point,",00:25:09.950,00:25:14.410

are [INAUDIBLE] and then,",00:25:14.410,00:25:20.267

Roughly to the vertices.,00:26:54.700,00:26:58.520

We can't do this.,00:27:02.670,00:27:05.660
"So, it's better that we
talked about it here,",00:27:05.660,00:27:07.687
"then that you try
to do it on the quiz",00:27:07.687,00:27:09.270
"and you have to discover
this on your own, right?",00:27:09.270,00:27:11.709
Good comment.,00:27:11.709,00:27:12.250
"AUDIENCE: Didn't understand
what you meant by that lecture.",00:27:12.250,00:27:14.708
Now it makes sense.,00:27:14.708,00:27:15.600
"PROFESSOR: That's
completely different.",00:27:15.600,00:27:17.380
"AUDIENCE: That wasn't the
thing he was talking about?",00:27:17.380,00:27:18.610
PROFESSOR: That's different.,00:27:18.610,00:27:19.920
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:27:19.920,00:27:22.800
"PROFESSOR: That's where
relaxation can go wrong.",00:27:22.800,00:27:25.070
"So if you show that if you relax
the edges in a random order,",00:27:25.070,00:27:27.660
"you can have an exponential
number of steps.",00:27:27.660,00:27:29.840

"for any graph, no matter
how good your algorithm is.",00:27:35.410,00:27:40.161
"So we're not going to be
able to enumerate them.",00:27:40.161,00:27:42.160
Let's try something else.,00:27:42.160,00:27:43.201
"AUDIENCE: You have
another suggestion?",00:27:47.981,00:27:49.945
Just look at all the--,00:27:49.945,00:27:51.890
"PROFESSOR: So,
you're doing this.",00:27:51.890,00:27:53.700
You're looking here.,00:27:53.700,00:27:56.035
Everyone's looking here.,00:27:56.035,00:27:57.800
How about this?,00:27:57.800,00:27:58.880
AUDIENCE: We should do that?,00:28:03.236,00:28:04.690
"PROFESSOR: Ther's that, right?",00:28:04.690,00:28:05.510
There's a transform.,00:28:05.510,00:28:06.360
"You need to transform
your graph in some way,",00:28:06.360,00:28:08.430
then run the algorithm.,00:28:08.430,00:28:10.040
"And then reading off the
outputs should be easy.",00:28:10.040,00:28:14.110
"I claim that the hard step
is the transform step, not",00:28:14.110,00:28:16.382
the read off step.,00:28:16.382,00:28:17.398
"Let me give you one
more piece of intuition.",00:28:24.982,00:28:26.815
"We're going to keep
track of states, somehow.",00:28:30.860,00:28:34.130
Remember Rubik's cube?,00:28:34.130,00:28:36.120

"Here, suppose I'm looking
at the path from S",00:28:43.280,00:28:48.360
"to D. The problem
that I have with this",00:28:48.360,00:28:51.530
"is that, if I have an algorithm
that tells me the shortest",00:28:51.530,00:28:55.480
"path from S to D is something,
I don't know if it's even",00:28:55.480,00:28:59.980
or if it's odd.,00:28:59.980,00:29:00.820
It's not keeping track of that.,00:29:00.820,00:29:02.990
It's missing some state.,00:29:02.990,00:29:04.090
"The state that it's
missing is whether the path",00:29:04.090,00:29:06.450
"that I used to get here
is even or odd length.",00:29:06.450,00:29:09.470
"I should do something
to the graph",00:29:09.470,00:29:10.990
to keep track of this state.,00:29:10.990,00:29:12.396
AUDIENCE: Can you BFS it once?,00:29:16.590,00:29:17.990
To plan-- You BFS once.,00:29:17.990,00:29:23.744
"Then you that B and
C are all like 108,",00:29:23.744,00:29:27.076
"and then you know
that E and D are 208?",00:29:27.076,00:29:28.980

I take this path.",00:29:32.210,00:29:36.650
"It might be 108, might be 208.",00:29:36.650,00:29:41.510
"But, this is good.",00:29:41.510,00:29:42.260
"This is what you'll
do on a quiz, right?",00:29:42.260,00:29:43.926
"You come up with
an idea and then",00:29:43.926,00:29:46.680
"you're going to think
about it for a bit.",00:29:46.680,00:29:48.470
"If you get stuck, try
to convince yourself",00:29:48.470,00:29:51.000
that it's wrong.,00:29:51.000,00:29:52.255
"If things get too hard, discard
and look somewhere else.",00:29:52.255,00:29:56.480
"This is thought process, right?",00:29:56.480,00:29:57.780
"You think of something,
backtrack, backtrack,",00:29:57.780,00:30:00.197
"backtrack, and eventually you
get to the right solution.",00:30:00.197,00:30:02.530
"Let's go over the
solution for this one,",00:30:13.824,00:30:15.490
"and then I'll give you a hard
one that is sort of like this.",00:30:15.490,00:30:19.870
"Then I'll want the solution
from you for that one.",00:30:19.870,00:30:22.970
"I'm going to draw this

a lot of things with it.",00:30:32.650,00:30:36.366

run Dijkstra on it",00:30:40.713,00:30:42.420

instead of one node",00:31:06.594,00:31:08.010
"I'll have two nodes
for each node.",00:31:08.010,00:31:10.850

this time.,00:51:09.140,00:51:10.430
"You start at time
0 at your source",00:51:10.430,00:51:12.300
"and then your edges go represent
the moves that you can make.",00:51:12.300,00:51:17.350
"So, you could start
in Boston at 8:00 AM.",00:51:17.350,00:51:20.360
"And you could take
I-90 and end up",00:51:20.360,00:51:22.570
"in-- I don't know Massachusetts

[LAUGHTER],00:51:29.420,00:51:31.080
AUDIENCE: Amherst.,00:51:31.080,00:51:32.000
"PROFESSOR: Amherst, OK.",00:51:32.000,00:51:32.980
"So you started in
Boston 8:00 AM,",00:51:32.980,00:51:34.354
"you end up at Amherst
at 9, 10:00 AM.",00:51:34.354,00:51:37.240
Right?,00:51:37.240,00:51:37.740
So this is one edge.,00:51:37.740,00:51:39.450
"The edges represent
the moves that you",00:51:39.450,00:51:41.490
could make in this graph.,00:51:41.490,00:51:42.810
Does this makes?,00:51:46.110,00:51:47.230
"AUDIENCE: I don't understand
the two last lines there.",00:51:47.230,00:51:51.475
"I don't really get what we
were doing there [INAUDIBLE].",00:51:51.475,00:51:54.427
"PROFESSOR: Let's see what
we're trying to do here.",00:51:54.427,00:51:56.510
"We're saying that, if I'm a node
U, and I'm starting at time T.",00:51:56.510,00:52:01.270
"AUDIENCE: Ya, so that's
like one piece of paper.",00:52:01.270,00:52:03.770
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:52:03.770,00:52:05.340
"I'm going to go on
the road, right?",00:52:05.340,00:52:07.250
"I'm going to go on
the road from U to V.",00:52:07.250,00:52:09.950
So where am I going to arrive?,00:52:09.950,00:52:12.064
"AUDIENCE: There at V
at some time plus that.",00:52:12.064,00:52:14.630
"PROFESSOR: Now we have
to figure out what time",00:52:14.630,00:52:16.546
we're going to arrive at.,00:52:16.546,00:52:17.620
"The time that we arrive
at is the original time,",00:52:17.620,00:52:20.610
"plus whatever time I'm
going to spend on the road.",00:52:20.610,00:52:23.520
"What's the time I
spend on the road?",00:52:23.520,00:52:25.040
"It's not constant because
I have that timetable that",00:52:25.040,00:52:27.940
includes traffic.,00:52:27.940,00:52:29.820
So this is what this tells me.,00:52:29.820,00:52:31.680
"This is what this big,
ugly formula is all about.",00:52:31.680,00:52:34.680
"It says the timetable
for this edge assuming",00:52:34.680,00:52:37.450
"you start at time T.
That's all there is.",00:52:37.450,00:52:39.950
Nothing else.,00:52:39.950,00:52:40.635
"AUDIENCE: What's the
second line, then?",00:52:40.635,00:52:42.260
"PROFESSOR: So the
second line is waiting.",00:52:42.260,00:52:44.490
"So if I don't have this
then I'm constrained",00:52:44.490,00:52:47.870
"in that I have to
drive all the time.",00:52:47.870,00:52:50.760
"I go from here to
Amherst, then I",00:52:50.760,00:52:52.804
"have to go from Amherst to
somewhere else, and keep going,",00:52:52.804,00:52:55.220
"keep going, keep going.",00:52:55.220,00:52:56.178
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:52:56.178,00:52:59.270
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, this is
where I wait for a minute.",00:52:59.270,00:53:01.850
"If I wait for a minute,
I don't consume any fuel",00:53:01.850,00:53:03.940
"and I go from time
T to time T plus 1.",00:53:03.940,00:53:07.049
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:53:07.049,00:53:08.320
PROFESSOR: Does this make sense?,00:53:08.320,00:53:10.860
"Do we want to analyze the
running time for this really",00:53:10.860,00:53:13.110
quickly?,00:53:13.110,00:53:14.060
AUDIENCE: Sure.,00:53:14.060,00:53:14.917
PROFESSOR: How many edges?,00:53:14.917,00:53:16.000
AUDIENCE: E times M?,00:53:19.325,00:53:21.230
"PROFESSOR: OK, let's do vertices
because vertices is quick.",00:53:21.230,00:53:24.401
AUDIENCE: V times M?,00:53:24.401,00:53:26.190
"PROFESSOR: So, edges is,
you're saying, V times M?",00:53:26.190,00:53:31.430
Almost.,00:53:31.430,00:53:31.970
AUDIENCE: Pause there.,00:53:31.970,00:53:33.039
"PROFESSOR: So there's
a pause, right?",00:53:33.039,00:53:34.580
How many pause edges do I have?,00:53:34.580,00:53:38.440
AUDIENCE: V-- M.,00:53:38.440,00:53:45.154
"PROFESSOR: This is
how many vertices?",00:53:45.154,00:53:46.695
This is how many edges?,00:53:46.695,00:53:48.380
"Plug this into which algorithm,
Dijkstra or Bellam-Ford?",00:53:48.380,00:53:52.255
AUDIENCE: Dijkstra.,00:53:52.255,00:53:54.170
PROFESSOR: Done!,00:53:54.170,00:53:56.460
"Yay, we solved the hard problem.",00:53:56.460,00:53:58.501
"AUDIENCE: How do you ensure
that the time's right?",00:53:58.501,00:54:00.810
"Do you have to go through
and see if there's a path?",00:54:00.810,00:54:03.305
"PROFESSOR: How do we
read the solution?",00:54:03.305,00:54:04.930
That's good.,00:54:04.930,00:54:05.430
That's a good question.,00:54:05.430,00:54:06.388
I like that.,00:54:06.388,00:54:07.290
"So, we're going to have M
vertices of the destination.",00:54:07.290,00:54:11.100
Alright?,00:54:11.100,00:54:12.450
"Let's see how they're
going to look like.",00:54:12.450,00:54:14.250
"First off, if you
start at 8:00 AM,",00:54:14.250,00:54:15.800
"maybe you're not going to make
it to New York at 8:01 AM.",00:54:15.800,00:54:19.810
"The vertex that says
New York at 8:01 AM",00:54:19.810,00:54:22.010
"is probably going to have
a cost of plus infinity.",00:54:22.010,00:54:26.180
"First off the really
early times are",00:54:26.180,00:54:27.887
"going to have a cost
of plus infinity.",00:54:27.887,00:54:29.470
Not going to happen.,00:54:29.470,00:54:30.770
"Then, at some point, the cost
is going to become finite.",00:54:30.770,00:54:34.310
"That's the fastest way you can
get from Boston to New York.",00:54:34.310,00:54:36.910
using the least amount of fuel.,00:54:39.740,00:54:41.800
"So the cost that you have there
is the answer to our problem.",00:54:41.800,00:54:45.490
"AUDIENCE: So basically,
when you get there you",00:54:45.490,00:54:47.590
have to enter it through all M.,00:54:47.590,00:54:49.550
"PROFESSOR: All M vertices that
correspond to the destination.",00:54:49.550,00:54:52.210
"The costs are going
to look like this.",00:54:56.917,00:54:58.500
"They're going to be infinity,
infinity, infinity all the way",00:54:58.500,00:55:01.732
"up, until some
point in here you're",00:55:01.732,00:55:03.190
going to have your final answer.,00:55:03.190,00:55:06.110
"The cost to get
there the fastest--",00:55:06.110,00:55:08.100
"see, you can get
there at 3:00 PM.",00:55:08.100,00:55:10.940
"This is how much fuel you have
to spend to get there at 3;00",00:55:10.940,00:55:13.850
PM.,00:55:13.850,00:55:14.690
"But, if you're willing
to wait until 3:01 PM,",00:55:14.690,00:55:18.410
"you're going to have the fastest
cost you can have for that.",00:55:18.410,00:55:21.500
"If you're willing
to wait until 3:02,",00:55:21.500,00:55:24.500
"you're going to have the
answer for that, too.",00:55:24.500,00:55:26.650
"So here you're going to get
the whole trade-off curve of,",00:55:26.650,00:55:29.550
"if you're willing to
wait for a few minutes,",00:55:29.550,00:55:31.384
"or if you're willing to
wait for an extra hour, how",00:55:31.384,00:55:33.508
much fuel you can save.,00:55:33.508,00:55:34.470
"So, I think that's cool
about your questions.",00:55:38.810,00:55:43.270
"You had a question, too.",00:55:43.270,00:55:44.600
"AUDIENCE: Why did
we have V times M",00:55:44.600,00:55:47.064
in the E prime expression?,00:55:47.064,00:55:48.910
"PROFESSOR: First off, we
have E times M, right?",00:55:50.972,00:55:52.930
We're good with these.,00:55:52.930,00:55:54.660
These are the waiting edges.,00:55:54.660,00:55:56.710
"AUDIENCE: So we are
waiting after every minute?",00:55:56.710,00:56:01.400
"PROFESSOR: The waiting
edges are vertex time",00:56:01.400,00:56:04.370
to vertex time plus 1.,00:56:04.370,00:56:05.890
How many vertices?,00:56:05.890,00:56:08.270
V. How many times?,00:56:08.270,00:56:09.913
AUDIENCE: M.,00:56:09.913,00:56:11.120
"PROFESSOR: So it's V times
M. Because at each minute,",00:56:11.120,00:56:15.866
"you can be at a
certain city and decide",00:56:15.866,00:56:17.490
"to wait one more minute
to stay the same city.",00:56:17.490,00:56:19.860
OK Does this make sense?,00:56:23.130,00:56:25.935
Thank you guys!,00:56:25.935,00:56:26.560
"I'm really happy we
solved the hard problem!",00:56:26.560,00:56:28.800
That's good.,00:56:28.800,00:56:30.520
