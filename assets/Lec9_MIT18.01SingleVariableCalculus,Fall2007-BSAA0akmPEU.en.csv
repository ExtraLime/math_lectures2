PROF.,00:00:21.576,00:00:22.076
"JERISON: We're starting
a new unit today.",00:00:22.076,00:00:26.950
"And, so this is Unit 2, and
it's called Applications",00:00:26.950,00:00:39.050
of Differentiation.,00:00:39.050,00:00:48.810
OK.,00:00:48.810,00:00:51.200
"So, the first application, and
we're going to do two today,",00:00:51.200,00:00:57.400
"is what are known as
linear approximations.",00:00:57.400,00:01:04.030
"Whoops, that should
have two p's in it.",00:01:04.030,00:01:06.310
Approximations.,00:01:06.310,00:01:12.460
"So, that can be summarized
with one formula,",00:01:12.460,00:01:16.360
"but it's going to take
us at least half an hour",00:01:16.360,00:01:19.040
"to explain how this
formula is used.",00:01:19.040,00:01:21.960
So here's the formula.,00:01:21.960,00:01:24.100
"It's f(x) is approximately equal
to its value at a base point",00:01:24.100,00:01:34.390
"plus the derivative
times x - x_0.",00:01:34.390,00:01:38.260
Right?,00:01:38.260,00:01:38.760
So this is the main formula.,00:01:38.760,00:01:42.720
For right now.,00:01:42.720,00:01:44.310
Put it in a box.,00:01:44.310,00:01:52.140
"And let me just describe
what it means, first.",00:01:52.140,00:01:57.430
"And then I'll describe
what it means again,",00:01:57.430,00:01:59.830
and several other times.,00:01:59.830,00:02:01.780
"So, first of all,
what it means is",00:02:01.780,00:02:04.690
"that if you have a
curve, which is y = f(x),",00:02:04.690,00:02:11.140
"it's approximately the
same as its tangent line.",00:02:11.140,00:02:18.860
"So this other side is the
equation of the tangent line.",00:02:18.860,00:02:37.020
So let's give an example.,00:02:37.020,00:02:43.090
"I'm going to take the
function f(x), which is ln x,",00:02:43.090,00:02:50.190
and then its derivative is 1/x.,00:02:50.190,00:02:53.980
"And, so let's take the
base point x_0 = 1.",00:02:58.990,00:03:03.800
"That's pretty much
the only place where",00:03:03.800,00:03:05.470
we know the logarithm for sure.,00:03:05.470,00:03:08.900
"And so, what we plug in
here now, are the values.",00:03:08.900,00:03:13.360
So f(1) is the log of 0.,00:03:13.360,00:03:17.890
"Or, sorry, the log
of 1, which is 0.",00:03:17.890,00:03:20.750
"And f'(1), well,
that's 1/1, which is 1.",00:03:20.750,00:03:28.130
"So now we have an
approximation formula which,",00:03:28.130,00:03:31.100
"if I copy down
what's right up here,",00:03:31.100,00:03:34.020
"it's going to be ln x is
approximately, so f(0)",00:03:34.020,00:03:40.560
"is 0, right?",00:03:40.560,00:03:44.480
Plus 1 times (x - 1).,00:03:44.480,00:03:49.700
"So I plugged in here,
for x_0, three places.",00:03:49.700,00:03:52.910
"I evaluated the coefficients and
this is the dependent variable.",00:03:52.910,00:04:00.670
"So, all told, if you
like, what I have here",00:04:00.670,00:04:03.720
"is that the logarithm of
x is approximately x - 1.",00:04:03.720,00:04:11.100
"And let me draw a
picture of this.",00:04:11.100,00:04:16.660
So here's the graph of ln x.,00:04:16.660,00:04:22.310
"And then, I'll draw in the
tangent line at the place",00:04:22.310,00:04:26.920
"that we're considering,
which is x = 1.",00:04:26.920,00:04:30.350
So here's the tangent line.,00:04:30.350,00:04:33.030
"And I've separated a
little bit, but really",00:04:33.030,00:04:35.195
"I probably should have drawn
it a little closer there,",00:04:35.195,00:04:37.551
to show you.,00:04:37.551,00:04:38.050
"The whole point is that
these two are nearby.",00:04:38.050,00:04:42.870
"But they're not
nearby everywhere.",00:04:42.870,00:04:44.400
So this is the line y = x - 1.,00:04:44.400,00:04:50.130
"Right, that's the tangent line.",00:04:50.130,00:04:51.960
"They're nearby only
when x is near 1.",00:04:51.960,00:04:55.240
"So say in this
little realm here.",00:04:55.240,00:04:58.010
"So when x is approximately
1, this is true.",00:04:58.010,00:05:05.050
"Once you get a
little farther away,",00:05:05.050,00:05:06.580
"this straight line,
this straight green line",00:05:06.580,00:05:08.413
will separate from the graph.,00:05:08.413,00:05:10.540
"But near this place
they're close together.",00:05:10.540,00:05:14.610
"So the idea, again, is that
the curve, the curved line,",00:05:14.610,00:05:17.920
"is approximately
the tangent line.",00:05:17.920,00:05:19.770
And this is one example of it.,00:05:19.770,00:05:25.350
"All right, so I want to
explain this in one more way.",00:05:25.350,00:05:29.850
"And then we want to
discuss it systematically.",00:05:29.850,00:05:32.690
"So the second way that
I want to describe this",00:05:32.690,00:05:37.090
"requires me to remind
you what the definition",00:05:37.090,00:05:39.310
of the derivative is.,00:05:39.310,00:05:41.290
"So, the definition
of a derivative",00:05:41.290,00:05:46.370
"is that it's the limit, as delta
x goes to 0, of delta f / delta",00:05:46.370,00:05:53.360
"x, that's one way of
writing it, all right?",00:05:53.360,00:05:56.410
"And this is the
way we defined it.",00:05:56.410,00:06:01.260
"And one of the things that
we did in the first unit",00:06:01.260,00:06:03.860
was we looked at this backwards.,00:06:03.860,00:06:09.070
"We used the derivative knowing
the derivatives of functions",00:06:09.070,00:06:12.890
to evaluate some limits.,00:06:12.890,00:06:14.250
"So you were supposed
to do that on your.",00:06:14.250,00:06:17.860
"In our test, there were
some examples there,",00:06:17.860,00:06:21.200
"at least one example,
where that was the easiest",00:06:21.200,00:06:23.200
way to do the problem.,00:06:23.200,00:06:26.140
"So in other words, you can
read this equation both ways.",00:06:26.140,00:06:28.850
"This is really, of course, the
same equation written twice.",00:06:28.850,00:06:31.770
"Now, what's new about
what we're going to do now",00:06:31.770,00:06:34.970
"is that we're going to take
this expression here, delta f",00:06:34.970,00:06:40.150
"/ delta x, and
we're going to say",00:06:40.150,00:06:42.910
"well, when delta x
is fairly near 0,",00:06:42.910,00:06:45.810
"this expression is
going to be fairly",00:06:45.810,00:06:47.360
close to the limiting value.,00:06:47.360,00:06:49.450
"So this is
approximately f'(x_0).",00:06:49.450,00:06:53.760
"So that, I claim, is the same
as what's in the box in pink",00:06:53.760,00:07:00.730
that I have over here.,00:07:00.730,00:07:02.810
"So this approximation formula
here is the same as this one.",00:07:02.810,00:07:10.840
"This is an average
rate of change,",00:07:10.840,00:07:13.760
"and this is an infinitesimal
rate of change.",00:07:13.760,00:07:16.420
And they're nearly the same.,00:07:16.420,00:07:17.980
That's the claim.,00:07:17.980,00:07:19.230
"So you'll have various exercises
in which this approximation is",00:07:19.230,00:07:22.950
the useful one to use.,00:07:22.950,00:07:25.220
"And I will, as I said, I'll be
illustrating this a little bit",00:07:25.220,00:07:28.860
today.,00:07:28.860,00:07:29.610
"Now, let me just explain why
those two formulas in the boxes",00:07:29.610,00:07:34.060
are the same.,00:07:34.060,00:07:36.560
"So let's just start over
here and explain that.",00:07:36.560,00:07:41.110
"So the smaller box is the same
thing if I multiply through",00:07:41.110,00:07:47.150
"by delta x, as delta f is
approximately f'(x_0) delta x.",00:07:47.150,00:07:55.490
"And now if I just
write out what this",00:07:55.490,00:07:57.290
"is, it's f(x),
right, minus f(x_0),",00:07:57.290,00:08:09.820
I'm going to write it this way.,00:08:09.820,00:08:11.630
"Which is approximately
f'(x_0), and this is x - x_0.",00:08:11.630,00:08:16.450
"So here I'm using the
notations delta x is x - x0.",00:08:16.450,00:08:25.670
"And so this is the
change in f, this",00:08:25.670,00:08:28.160
"is just rewriting
what delta x is.",00:08:28.160,00:08:32.270
"And now the last step is
just to put the constant",00:08:32.270,00:08:36.480
on the other side.,00:08:36.480,00:08:37.430
"So f(x) is approximately
f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0).",00:08:37.430,00:08:47.010
"So this is exactly what I had
just to begin with, right?",00:08:47.010,00:08:51.920
"So these two are
just algebraically",00:08:51.920,00:08:53.570
the same statement.,00:08:53.570,00:08:56.690
"That's one another
way of looking at it.",00:08:56.690,00:09:00.660
"All right, so now,
I want to go through",00:09:00.660,00:09:05.100
"some systematic
discussion here of",00:09:05.100,00:09:08.590
"several linear approximations,
which you're going",00:09:08.590,00:09:12.250
to be wanting to memorize.,00:09:12.250,00:09:14.850
"And rather than it's being
hard to memorize these,",00:09:14.850,00:09:18.020
it's supposed to remind you.,00:09:18.020,00:09:19.760
"So that you'll have a lot
of extra reinforcement",00:09:19.760,00:09:22.440
"in remembering
derivatives of all kinds.",00:09:22.440,00:09:25.240
"So, when we carry out these
systematic discussions,",00:09:25.240,00:09:31.240
"we want to make
things absolutely as",00:09:31.240,00:09:33.060
simple as possible.,00:09:33.060,00:09:34.550
"And so one of the
things that we do",00:09:34.550,00:09:36.640
"is we always use the
base point to be x_0.",00:09:36.640,00:09:40.380
"So I'm always going
to have x_0 = 0",00:09:40.380,00:09:44.180
"in this standard list of
formulas that I'm going to use.",00:09:44.180,00:09:48.920
"And if I put x_0 =
0, then this formula",00:09:48.920,00:09:52.030
"becomes f(x), a little
bit simpler to read.",00:09:52.030,00:09:56.130
"It becomes f(x)
is f(0) + f'(0) x.",00:09:56.130,00:09:59.980
"So this is probably
the form that you'll",00:10:03.520,00:10:05.950
want to remember most.,00:10:05.950,00:10:10.680
"That's again, just the
linear approximation.",00:10:10.680,00:10:12.580
"But one always has
to remember, and this",00:10:12.580,00:10:16.010
"is a very important thing, this
one only worked near x is 1.",00:10:16.010,00:10:22.650
"This approximation here really
only works when x is near x_0.",00:10:22.650,00:10:29.170
"So that's a little addition
that you need to throw in.",00:10:29.170,00:10:31.600
"So this one works
when x is near 0.",00:10:31.600,00:10:38.810
"You can't expect it
to be true far away.",00:10:38.810,00:10:40.770
"The curve can go
anywhere it wants,",00:10:40.770,00:10:42.790
"when it's far away from
the point of tangency.",00:10:42.790,00:10:46.500
"So, OK, so let's work this out.",00:10:46.500,00:10:49.060
"Let's do it for
the sine function,",00:10:49.060,00:10:51.560
"for the cosine function,
and for e^x, to begin with.",00:10:51.560,00:10:56.401
Yeah.,00:10:56.401,00:10:56.900
Question.,00:10:56.900,00:10:57.400
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:10:57.400,00:11:02.522
PROF.,00:11:02.522,00:11:03.022
JERISON: Yeah.,00:11:03.022,00:11:03.126
When does this one work.,00:11:03.126,00:11:04.125
"Well, so the question was,
when does this one work.",00:11:04.125,00:11:07.410
"Again, this is when x
is approximately x_0.",00:11:07.410,00:11:12.100
"Because it's actually the
same as this one over here.",00:11:12.100,00:11:18.130
OK.,00:11:18.130,00:11:20.050
"And indeed, that's
what's going on when",00:11:20.050,00:11:23.010
we take this limiting value.,00:11:23.010,00:11:24.870
Delta x going to 0 is the same.,00:11:24.870,00:11:26.760
Delta x small.,00:11:26.760,00:11:27.980
"So another way of saying it
is, the delta x is small.",00:11:27.980,00:11:37.050
"Now, exactly what we mean by
small will also be explained.",00:11:37.050,00:11:41.030
"But it is a matter to
some extent of intuition",00:11:41.030,00:11:45.240
"as to how much, how good it is.",00:11:45.240,00:11:47.620
"In practical cases,
people will really",00:11:47.620,00:11:49.650
"care about how small it is
before the approximation is",00:11:49.650,00:11:52.950
useful.,00:11:52.950,00:11:53.970
And that's a serious issue.,00:11:53.970,00:11:56.710
"All right, so let me carry out
these approximations for x.",00:11:56.710,00:12:00.200
"Again, this is
always for x near 0.",00:12:00.200,00:12:06.710
"So all of these are
going to be for x near 0.",00:12:06.710,00:12:08.930
"So in order to make
this computation,",00:12:08.930,00:12:10.790
I have to evaluate the function.,00:12:10.790,00:12:15.170
"I need to plug in
two numbers here.",00:12:15.170,00:12:17.817
In order to get this expression.,00:12:17.817,00:12:19.150
"I need to know what f(0) is and
I need to know what f'(0) is.",00:12:19.150,00:12:23.070
"If this is the function f(x),
then I'm going to make a little",00:12:23.070,00:12:26.110
"table over to the right here
with f' and then I'm going",00:12:26.110,00:12:30.615
"to evaluate f(0), and
then I'm going to evaluate",00:12:30.615,00:12:33.160
"f'(0), and then read off
what the answers are.",00:12:33.160,00:12:38.150
"Right, so first of all if
the function is sine x,",00:12:38.150,00:12:41.450
the derivative is cosine x.,00:12:41.450,00:12:44.170
"The value of f(0),
that's sine of 0, is 0.",00:12:44.170,00:12:49.690
The derivative is cosine.,00:12:49.690,00:12:51.550
Cosine of 0 is 1.,00:12:51.550,00:12:54.060
So there we go.,00:12:54.060,00:12:55.350
"So now we have the
coefficients 0 and 1.",00:12:55.350,00:12:58.850
So this number is 0.,00:12:58.850,00:13:01.070
And this number is 1.,00:13:01.070,00:13:04.480
"So what we get here is 0 + 1x,
so this is approximately x.",00:13:04.480,00:13:11.310
"There's the linear
approximation to sin x.",00:13:11.310,00:13:18.080
"Similarly, so now this
is a routine matter",00:13:18.080,00:13:20.570
"to just read this
off for this table.",00:13:20.570,00:13:22.440
"We'll do it for the
cosine function.",00:13:22.440,00:13:23.940
"If you differentiate the
cosine, what you get is -sin x.",00:13:23.940,00:13:30.230
"The value at 0 is 1, so
that's cosine of 0 at 1.",00:13:30.230,00:13:34.940
"The value of this
minus sine at 0 is 0.",00:13:34.940,00:13:39.540
"So this is going back
over here, 1 + 0x,",00:13:39.540,00:13:43.890
so this is approximately 1.,00:13:43.890,00:13:48.170
"This linear function
happens to be constant.",00:13:48.170,00:13:52.300
"And finally, if I do need e^x,
its derivative is again e^x,",00:13:52.300,00:13:58.730
"and its value at 0 is 1, the
value of the derivative at 0 is",00:13:58.730,00:14:02.840
also 1.,00:14:02.840,00:14:04.180
"So both of the terms here,
f(0) and f'(0), they're both 1",00:14:04.180,00:14:09.500
and we get 1 + x.,00:14:09.500,00:14:15.400
"So these are the
linear approximations.",00:14:15.400,00:14:18.360
You can memorize these.,00:14:18.360,00:14:19.610
"You'll probably remember them
either this way or that way.",00:14:19.610,00:14:23.940
"This collection of
information here",00:14:23.940,00:14:26.130
"encodes the same
collection of information",00:14:26.130,00:14:28.556
as we have over here.,00:14:28.556,00:14:29.430
"For the values of the
function and the values",00:14:29.430,00:14:31.460
of their derivatives at 0.,00:14:31.460,00:14:36.310
"So let me just emphasize again
the geometric point of view",00:14:36.310,00:14:39.370
"by drawing pictures
of these results.",00:14:39.370,00:14:48.840
"So first of all, for the sine
function, here's the sine",00:14:48.840,00:14:56.605
"- well, close enough.",00:14:56.605,00:15:03.500
"So that's - boy, now that is
quite some sine, isn't it?",00:15:03.500,00:15:07.170
"I should try to make the two
bumps be the same height,",00:15:07.170,00:15:10.570
roughly speaking.,00:15:10.570,00:15:11.870
"Anyway the tangent line
we're talking about is here.",00:15:11.870,00:15:15.450
And this is y = x.,00:15:15.450,00:15:17.730
And this is the function sine x.,00:15:17.730,00:15:22.870
"And near 0, those things
coincide pretty closely.",00:15:22.870,00:15:28.870
"The cosine function, I'll
put that underneath, I guess.",00:15:28.870,00:15:34.040
I think I can fit it.,00:15:34.040,00:15:35.110
Make it a little smaller here.,00:15:35.110,00:15:39.390
"So for the cosine
function, we're up here.",00:15:39.390,00:15:44.850
It's y = 1.,00:15:44.850,00:15:48.500
"Well, no wonder the
tangent line is constant.",00:15:48.500,00:15:51.990
It's horizontal.,00:15:51.990,00:15:54.630
"The tangent line is horizontal,
so the function corresponding",00:15:54.630,00:15:57.920
is constant.,00:15:57.920,00:15:59.560
So this is y = cos x.,00:15:59.560,00:16:04.890
"And finally, if I draw y = e^x,
that's coming down like this.",00:16:04.890,00:16:14.790
And the tangent line is here.,00:16:14.790,00:16:17.870
And it's y = 1 + x.,00:16:17.870,00:16:19.410
"The value is 1 and
the slope is 1.",00:16:19.410,00:16:24.700
"So this is how to remember
it graphically if you like.",00:16:24.700,00:16:28.030
"This analytic picture
is extremely important",00:16:28.030,00:16:34.810
"and will help you to
deal with sines, cosines",00:16:34.810,00:16:37.950
and exponentials.,00:16:37.950,00:16:41.090
"Yes, question.",00:16:41.090,00:16:41.730
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:16:41.730,00:16:45.806
PROF.,00:16:45.806,00:16:46.306
"JERISON: The question
is what do you normally",00:16:46.306,00:16:48.181
use linear approximations for.,00:16:48.181,00:16:50.350
Good question.,00:16:50.350,00:16:51.140
We're getting there.,00:16:51.140,00:16:52.260
"First, we're getting a
little library of them",00:16:52.260,00:16:54.210
"and I'll give you
a few examples.",00:16:54.210,00:16:56.220
"OK, so now, I need
to finish the catalog",00:16:56.220,00:17:02.540
"with two more examples which
are just a little bit, slightly",00:17:02.540,00:17:05.700
more challenging.,00:17:05.700,00:17:07.620
And a little bit less obvious.,00:17:07.620,00:17:09.860
"So, the next couple that we're
going to do are ln(1+x) and (1",00:17:09.860,00:17:22.356
+ x)^r.,00:17:22.356,00:17:25.530
"OK, these are the last two
that we're going to write down.",00:17:25.530,00:17:28.130
"And that you need
to think about.",00:17:28.130,00:17:30.850
"Now, the procedure is
the same as over here.",00:17:30.850,00:17:34.930
"Namely, I have to write down
f' and I have to write down",00:17:34.930,00:17:39.230
"f'(0) and I have to
write down f'(0).",00:17:39.230,00:17:41.992
"And then I'll have
the coefficients",00:17:41.992,00:17:43.450
"to be able to fill in
what the approximation is.",00:17:43.450,00:17:46.970
"So f' = 1 / (1+x), in the
case of the logarithm.",00:17:46.970,00:17:51.840
"And f(0), if I plug in,
that's log of 1, which is 0.",00:17:51.840,00:17:57.010
"And f' if I plug
in 0 here, I get 1.",00:17:57.010,00:18:01.190
"And similarly if I do it for
this one, I get r(1+x)^(r-1).",00:18:01.190,00:18:04.850
"And when I plug in f(0),
I get 1^r, which is 1.",00:18:07.850,00:18:12.320
"And here I get r
(1)^(r-1), which is r.",00:18:12.320,00:18:18.850
"So the corresponding statement
here is that ln(1+x) is",00:18:18.850,00:18:22.830
approximately x.,00:18:22.830,00:18:24.790
"And (1+x)^r is
approximately 1 + rx.",00:18:24.790,00:18:31.140
"That's 0 + 1x and
here we have 1 + rx.",00:18:31.140,00:18:35.660
"And now, I do want
to make a connection,",00:18:41.370,00:18:44.320
"explain to you what's going
on here and the connection",00:18:44.320,00:18:47.120
with the first example.,00:18:47.120,00:18:48.750
"We already did the
logarithm once.",00:18:48.750,00:18:50.800
"And let's just point out
that these two computations",00:18:50.800,00:18:53.520
"are the same, or
practically the same.",00:18:53.520,00:18:57.470
"Here I use the base point
1, but because of my,",00:18:57.470,00:19:02.580
"sort of, convenient
form, which will end up,",00:19:02.580,00:19:05.420
"I claim, being much
more convenient",00:19:05.420,00:19:07.180
"for pretty much
every purpose, we",00:19:07.180,00:19:09.310
"want to do these things
near x is approximately 0.",00:19:09.310,00:19:14.510
"You cannot expand the logarithm
and understand a tangent line",00:19:14.510,00:19:19.040
"for it at x equals 0, because
it goes down to minus infinity.",00:19:19.040,00:19:22.730
"Similarly, if you
try to graph (1+x)^r,",00:19:22.730,00:19:27.260
"x^r without the 1 here,
you'll discover that sometimes",00:19:27.260,00:19:30.690
"the slope is infinite,
and so forth.",00:19:30.690,00:19:33.260
"So this is a bad
choice of point.",00:19:33.260,00:19:35.500
"1 is a much better choice
of a place to expand around.",00:19:35.500,00:19:39.030
"And then we shift things so
that it looks like it's x = 0,",00:19:39.030,00:19:42.150
by shifting by the 1.,00:19:42.150,00:19:43.600
"So the connection with the
previous example is that",00:19:43.600,00:19:50.950
"the-- what we wrote before I
could write as ln u = u - 1.",00:19:50.950,00:19:57.020
"Right, that's just recopying
what I have over here.",00:19:57.020,00:20:00.890
"Except with the letter u
rather than the letter x.",00:20:00.890,00:20:04.930
"And then I plug in, u = 1 + x.",00:20:04.930,00:20:12.790
"And then that, if
I copy it down,",00:20:12.790,00:20:14.920
"you see that I have
a u in place of 1+x,",00:20:14.920,00:20:16.880
that's the same as this.,00:20:16.880,00:20:19.020
"And if I write out u-1,
if I subtract 1 from u,",00:20:19.020,00:20:22.880
that means that it's x.,00:20:22.880,00:20:23.924
"So that's what's on the
right-hand side there.",00:20:23.924,00:20:25.840
"So these are the
same computation,",00:20:25.840,00:20:27.720
I've just changed the variable.,00:20:27.720,00:20:38.860
"So now I want to try to
address the question that was",00:20:38.860,00:20:44.220
asked about how this is used.,00:20:44.220,00:20:47.380
And what the importance is.,00:20:47.380,00:20:49.370
"And what I'm going to do is
just give you one example here.",00:20:49.370,00:20:58.010
And then try to emphasize.,00:20:58.010,00:21:02.690
"The first way in which
this is a useful idea.",00:21:02.690,00:21:05.930
"So, or maybe this is
the second example.",00:21:05.930,00:21:10.460
If you like.,00:21:10.460,00:21:13.330
"So we'll call this
Example 2, maybe.",00:21:13.330,00:21:16.460
"So let's just take
the logarithm of 1.1.",00:21:16.460,00:21:19.070
Just a second.,00:21:19.070,00:21:22.220
Let's take the logarithm of 1.1.,00:21:22.220,00:21:25.710
"So I claim that, according to
our rules, I can glance at this",00:21:25.710,00:21:30.150
"and I can immediately see
that it's approximately 1/10.",00:21:30.150,00:21:33.680
So what did I use here?,00:21:33.680,00:21:35.710
"I used that ln(1+x)
is approximately x,",00:21:35.710,00:21:42.630
"and the value of x
that I used was 1/10.",00:21:42.630,00:21:46.281
Right?,00:21:46.281,00:21:46.780
"So that is the
formula, so I should",00:21:46.780,00:21:48.850
"put a box around these
two formulas too.",00:21:48.850,00:21:54.560
"That's this formula here,
applied with x = 1/10.",00:21:54.560,00:21:57.730
"And I'm claiming that 1/10 is
a sufficiently small number,",00:21:57.730,00:22:01.680
"sufficiently close to 0,
that this is an OK statement.",00:22:01.680,00:22:08.845
"So the first
question that I want",00:22:08.845,00:22:10.220
"to ask you is,
which do you think",00:22:10.220,00:22:12.000
is a more complicated thing.,00:22:12.000,00:22:14.470
"The left-hand side or
the right-hand side.",00:22:14.470,00:22:19.244
"I claim that this is a
more complicated thing,",00:22:19.244,00:22:21.160
"you'd have to go to a calculator
to punch out and figure out",00:22:21.160,00:22:24.070
what this thing is.,00:22:24.070,00:22:25.170
This is easy.,00:22:25.170,00:22:26.230
You know what a tenth is.,00:22:26.230,00:22:28.730
"So the distinction
that I want to make",00:22:28.730,00:22:31.530
"is that this half, this
part, this is hard.",00:22:31.530,00:22:37.190
And this is easy.,00:22:37.190,00:22:40.700
"Now, that may look
contradictory,",00:22:40.700,00:22:43.090
"but I want to just do
it right above as well.",00:22:43.090,00:22:45.610
This is hard.,00:22:45.610,00:22:48.940
And this is easy.,00:22:48.940,00:22:52.160
OK.,00:22:52.160,00:22:52.870
"This looks uglier, but
actually this is the hard one.",00:22:52.870,00:22:56.850
"And this is giving us
information about it.",00:22:56.850,00:22:58.650
"Now, let me show
you why that's true.",00:22:58.650,00:23:00.930
Look down this column here.,00:23:00.930,00:23:02.530
"These are the hard
ones, hard functions.",00:23:02.530,00:23:05.230
These are the easy functions.,00:23:05.230,00:23:07.360
What's easier than this?,00:23:07.360,00:23:09.970
Nothing.,00:23:09.970,00:23:11.260
OK.,00:23:11.260,00:23:11.760
"Well, yeah, 0.",00:23:11.760,00:23:12.590
That's easier.,00:23:12.590,00:23:14.480
Over here it gets even worse.,00:23:14.480,00:23:16.060
"These are the hard functions
and these are the easy ones.",00:23:16.060,00:23:21.090
"So that's the main advantage
of linear approximation",00:23:21.090,00:23:24.910
"is you get something much
simpler to deal with.",00:23:24.910,00:23:27.730
"And if you've made a
valid approximation",00:23:27.730,00:23:30.380
"you can make much
progress on problems.",00:23:30.380,00:23:33.510
"OK, we'll be doing
some more examples,",00:23:33.510,00:23:35.780
"but I saw some more questions
before I made that point.",00:23:35.780,00:23:38.990
Yeah.,00:23:38.990,00:23:39.490

"I guess I've never used that

JERISON: OK.,00:24:12.410,00:24:12.990
So let's continue here.,00:24:12.990,00:24:14.900
"Let me give you some more
examples, where it becomes",00:24:14.900,00:24:18.570
even more vivid if you like.,00:24:18.570,00:24:21.460
"That this approximation
is giving us something",00:24:21.460,00:24:24.340
a little simpler to deal with.,00:24:24.340,00:24:30.190
So here's Example 3.,00:24:30.190,00:24:34.960
"I want to, I'll find the linear
approximation near x = 0.",00:24:34.960,00:24:48.400
"I also - when I write this
expression near x = 0,",00:24:48.400,00:24:52.340
that's the same thing as this.,00:24:52.340,00:24:55.020
"That's the same thing as
saying x is approximately 0 -",00:24:55.020,00:24:58.940
"of the function e^(-3x)
divided by square root 1+x.",00:24:58.940,00:25:06.360
So here's a function.,00:25:09.170,00:25:17.390
OK.,00:25:17.390,00:25:17.890
"Now, what I claim I want
to use for the purposes",00:25:17.890,00:25:21.990
"of this approximation,
are just the sum",00:25:21.990,00:25:26.830
"of the approximation formulas
that we've already derived.",00:25:26.830,00:25:32.110
"And just to combine
them algebraically.",00:25:32.110,00:25:33.850
"So I'm not going
to do any calculus,",00:25:33.850,00:25:35.350
I'm just going to remember.,00:25:35.350,00:25:37.080
"So with e^(-3x), it's pretty
clear that I should be using",00:25:37.080,00:25:41.580
this formula for e^x.,00:25:41.580,00:25:44.570
"For the other one, it may be
slightly less obvious but we",00:25:44.570,00:25:47.820
have powers of 1+x over here.,00:25:47.820,00:25:53.470
So let's plug those in.,00:25:53.470,00:25:55.510
"I'll put this up so that
you can remember it.",00:25:55.510,00:26:04.640
"And we're going to carry
out this approximation.",00:26:04.640,00:26:10.810
"So, first of all, I'm going
to write this so that it's",00:26:10.810,00:26:16.380
slightly more suggestive.,00:26:16.380,00:26:17.910
"Namely, I'm going to
write it as a product.",00:26:17.910,00:26:23.630
"And there you can
now see the exponent.",00:26:23.630,00:26:27.220
"In this case, r = 1/2, eh
-1/2, that we're going to use.",00:26:27.220,00:26:31.870
OK.,00:26:31.870,00:26:32.900
"So now I have
e^(-3x) (1+x)^(-1/2),",00:26:32.900,00:26:39.880
"and that's going to
be approximately--",00:26:39.880,00:26:41.940
"well I'm going to
use this formula.",00:26:41.940,00:26:44.220
"I have to use it correctly. x is
replaced by -3x, so this is 1 -",00:26:44.220,00:26:48.760
3x.,00:26:48.760,00:26:50.160
"And then over here,
I can just copy",00:26:50.160,00:26:52.270
"verbatim the other approximation
formula with r = -1/2.",00:26:52.270,00:26:57.900
So this is times 1 - 1/2 x.,00:26:57.900,00:27:05.670
"And now I'm going to carry
out the multiplication.",00:27:05.670,00:27:11.080
"So this is 1 - 3x
- 1/2 x + 3/2 x^2.",00:27:11.080,00:27:17.100
"So now, here's our formula.",00:27:27.310,00:27:32.090
"So now this isn't
where things stop.",00:27:32.090,00:27:34.340
"And indeed, in this
kind of arithmetic",00:27:34.340,00:27:36.960
"that I'm describing
now, things are",00:27:36.960,00:27:39.420
"easier than they are in
ordinary algebra, in arithmetic.",00:27:39.420,00:27:43.780
"The reason is that there's
another step, which",00:27:43.780,00:27:47.770
I'm now going to perform.,00:27:47.770,00:27:49.200
"Which is that I'm going to
throw away this term here.",00:27:49.200,00:27:54.602
I'm going to ignore it.,00:27:54.602,00:27:55.560
"In fact, I didn't even
have to work it out.",00:27:55.560,00:27:57.480
"Because I'm going
to throw it away.",00:27:57.480,00:27:59.070
"So the reason is
that already, when",00:27:59.070,00:28:01.520
"I passed from this
expression to this one,",00:28:01.520,00:28:03.424
"that is from this type
of thing to this thing,",00:28:03.424,00:28:05.340
"I was already throwing away
quadratic and higher-ordered",00:28:05.340,00:28:07.940
terms.,00:28:07.940,00:28:09.460
"So this isn't the
only quadratic term.",00:28:09.460,00:28:12.650
There are tons of them.,00:28:12.650,00:28:13.640
"I have to ignore
all of them if I'm",00:28:13.640,00:28:14.920
going to ignore some of them.,00:28:14.920,00:28:16.128
"And in fact, I only want to
be left with the linear stuff.",00:28:16.128,00:28:20.240
"Because that's all I'm really
getting a valid computation",00:28:20.240,00:28:23.220
for.,00:28:23.220,00:28:24.080
"So, this is approximately
1 minus, so let's see.",00:28:24.080,00:28:28.060
It's a total of 7/2 x.,00:28:28.060,00:28:32.450
And this is the answer.,00:28:32.450,00:28:36.410
This is the linear part.,00:28:36.410,00:28:38.290
So the x^2 term is negligible.,00:28:38.290,00:28:42.800
So we drop x^2 term.,00:28:42.800,00:28:46.680
"Terms, and higher.",00:28:46.680,00:28:55.712
"All of those terms
should be lower-order.",00:28:55.712,00:28:57.420
"If you imagine x is
1/10, or maybe 1/100,",00:28:57.420,00:29:00.180
"then these terms will end
up being much smaller.",00:29:00.180,00:29:04.470
"So we have a rather
crude approach.",00:29:04.470,00:29:08.970
"And that's really
the simplicity,",00:29:08.970,00:29:10.530
and that's the savings.,00:29:10.530,00:29:15.360
"So now, since this unit
is called Applications,",00:29:15.360,00:29:21.020
"and these are indeed
applications to math,",00:29:21.020,00:29:24.380
"I also wanted to give you
a real-life application.",00:29:24.380,00:29:30.360
"Or a place where linear
approximations come up",00:29:30.360,00:29:34.290
in real life.,00:29:34.290,00:29:46.590
"So maybe we'll call
this Example 4.",00:29:46.590,00:29:50.560
"This is supposedly
a real-life example.",00:29:50.560,00:29:57.270
"I'll try to persuade
you that it is.",00:29:57.270,00:30:06.580
"So I like this example because
it's got a lot of math,",00:30:06.580,00:30:09.840
as well as physics in it.,00:30:09.840,00:30:11.170
"So here I am, on the
surface of the earth.",00:30:11.170,00:30:17.000
"And here is a satellite
going this way.",00:30:17.000,00:30:24.610
"At some velocity, v.
And this satellite",00:30:24.610,00:30:30.790
"has a clock on it because
this is a GPS satellite.",00:30:30.790,00:30:33.630
"And it has a time, T, OK?",00:30:33.630,00:30:37.720
"But I have a watch, in
fact it's right here.",00:30:37.720,00:30:41.160
And I have a time which I keep.,00:30:41.160,00:30:44.030
"Which is T', And there's
an interesting relationship",00:30:44.030,00:30:48.170
"between T and T', which
is called time dilation.",00:30:48.170,00:30:56.650
"And this is from
special relativity.",00:30:56.650,00:31:04.860
And it's the following formula.,00:31:04.860,00:31:06.470
"T' = T divided by the
square root of 1 - v^2/c^2,",00:31:06.470,00:31:13.720
"where v is the velocity
of the satellite,",00:31:13.720,00:31:17.230
and c is the speed of light.,00:31:17.230,00:31:22.960
"So now I'd like to get a
rough idea of how different",00:31:22.960,00:31:28.080
"my watch is from the
clock on the satellite.",00:31:28.080,00:31:34.980
"So I'm going to use
this same approximation,",00:31:34.980,00:31:38.540
we've already used it once.,00:31:38.540,00:31:40.990
I'm going to write t.,00:31:40.990,00:31:42.010
But now let me just remind you.,00:31:42.010,00:31:43.990
"The situation here is, we
have something of the form",00:31:43.990,00:31:46.809
(1-u)^(-1/2).,00:31:46.809,00:31:47.350
"That's what's happening when
I multiply through here.",00:31:52.410,00:31:55.760
So with u = v^2 / c^2.,00:31:55.760,00:31:59.500
"So in real life, of
course, the expression",00:32:02.080,00:32:05.240
"that you're going to use
the linear approximation on",00:32:05.240,00:32:07.780
isn't necessarily itself linear.,00:32:07.780,00:32:10.280
It can be any physical quantity.,00:32:10.280,00:32:11.990
"So in this case it's v
squared over c squared.",00:32:11.990,00:32:15.940
"And now the
approximation formula",00:32:15.940,00:32:18.189
"says that if this is
approximately equal to, well",00:32:18.189,00:32:20.230
again it's the same rule.,00:32:20.230,00:32:21.540
"There's an r and then x
is -u, so this is - - 1/2,",00:32:21.540,00:32:25.870
so it's 1 + 1/2 u.,00:32:25.870,00:32:34.610
"So this is approximately,
by the same rule, this is T,",00:32:34.610,00:32:40.350
"T' is approximately t
T(1 + 1/2 v^2/c^2) Now,",00:32:40.350,00:32:55.800
"I promised you that this
would be a real-life problem.",00:32:55.800,00:32:58.150
"So the question is when people
were designing these GPS",00:32:58.150,00:33:02.520
"systems, they run clocks
in the satellites.",00:33:02.520,00:33:06.666
"You're down there, you're
making your measurements,",00:33:06.666,00:33:08.790
"you're talking to
the satellite by--",00:33:08.790,00:33:12.270
"or you're receiving its
signals from its radio.",00:33:12.270,00:33:15.310
"The question is, is this
going to cause problems",00:33:15.310,00:33:19.010
in the transmission.,00:33:19.010,00:33:23.670
"And there are dozens
of such problems",00:33:23.670,00:33:25.580
that you have to check for.,00:33:25.580,00:33:27.180
"So in this case, what
actually happened",00:33:27.180,00:33:29.950
"is that v is about 4
kilometers per second.",00:33:29.950,00:33:35.010
"That's how fast the GPS
satellites actually go.",00:33:35.010,00:33:38.740
"In fact, they had to decide to
put them at a certain altitude",00:33:38.740,00:33:41.430
"and they could've tweaked
this if they had put them",00:33:41.430,00:33:43.950
at different places.,00:33:43.950,00:33:46.040
"Anyway, the speed of light is
3 * 10^5 kilometers per second.",00:33:46.040,00:33:55.330
"So this number, v^2 / c^2
is approximately 10^(-10).",00:33:55.330,00:34:01.100
"Now, if you actually keep
track of how much of an error",00:34:05.710,00:34:11.160
"that would make in a GPS
location, what you would find",00:34:11.160,00:34:15.530
"is maybe it's a millimeter
or something like that.",00:34:15.530,00:34:17.820
So in fact it doesn't matter.,00:34:17.820,00:34:20.080
So that's nice.,00:34:20.080,00:34:21.380
"But in fact the
engineers who were",00:34:21.380,00:34:23.180
"designing these systems actually
did use this very computation.",00:34:23.180,00:34:26.870
Exactly this.,00:34:26.870,00:34:29.270
"And the way that
they used it was,",00:34:29.270,00:34:31.640
"they decided that because
the clocks were different,",00:34:31.640,00:34:35.190
"when the satellite broadcasts
its radio frequency,",00:34:35.190,00:34:38.740
that frequency would be shifted.,00:34:38.740,00:34:40.350
Would be offset.,00:34:40.350,00:34:41.500
"And they decided that the
fidelity was so important",00:34:41.500,00:34:44.426
"that they would send
the satellites off",00:34:44.426,00:34:46.050
"with this kind of,
exactly this, offset.",00:34:46.050,00:34:49.120
"To compensate for the
way the signal is.",00:34:49.120,00:34:51.460
"So from the point of
view of good reception",00:34:51.460,00:34:53.360
"on your little GPS device, they
changed the frequency at which",00:34:53.360,00:34:56.950
"the transmitter
in the satellites,",00:34:56.950,00:35:00.160
according to exactly this rule.,00:35:00.160,00:35:04.990
"And incidentally, the reason
why they didn't-- they ignored",00:35:04.990,00:35:08.120
"higher-order terms, the
sort of quadratic terms,",00:35:08.120,00:35:11.010
"is that if you take u^2
that's a size 10^(-20).",00:35:11.010,00:35:17.460
"And that really is
totally negligible.",00:35:17.460,00:35:20.104
"That doesn't matter to
any measurement at all.",00:35:20.104,00:35:22.020
"That's on the order
of nanometers,",00:35:22.020,00:35:25.210
"and it's not important for
any of the uses to which GPS",00:35:25.210,00:35:30.200
is put.,00:35:30.200,00:35:32.510
"OK, so that's a real example of
a use of linear approximations.",00:35:32.510,00:35:40.470
"So. let's take a
little pause here.",00:35:40.470,00:35:42.720
"I'm going to switch
gears and talk",00:35:42.720,00:35:44.850
about quadratic approximations.,00:35:44.850,00:35:46.610
"But before I do that, let's
have some more questions.",00:35:46.610,00:35:48.900
Yeah.,00:35:48.900,00:35:49.400
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:35:49.400,00:36:03.780
PROF.,00:36:03.780,00:36:04.566
"JERISON: OK, so the
question was asked,",00:36:04.566,00:36:08.040
"suppose I did this
by different method.",00:36:08.040,00:36:11.580
"Suppose I applied the
original formula here.",00:36:11.580,00:36:15.840
"Namely, I define
the function f(x),",00:36:15.840,00:36:18.050
which was this function here.,00:36:18.050,00:36:22.140
"And then I plugged
in its value at x = 0",00:36:22.140,00:36:25.050
"and the value of its
derivative at x = 0.",00:36:25.050,00:36:28.000
"So the answer is, yes, it's
also true that if I call this",00:36:28.000,00:36:32.510
"function f f(x), then it
must be true that the linear",00:36:32.510,00:36:37.940
"approximation is f(x_0) plus
f' of - I'm sorry, it's at 0,",00:36:37.940,00:36:45.910
"so it's f(0), f'(0) times x.",00:36:45.910,00:36:49.340
So that should be true.,00:36:49.340,00:36:50.550
"That's the formula
that we're using.",00:36:50.550,00:36:52.810
It's up there in the pink also.,00:36:52.810,00:36:57.170
So this is the formula.,00:36:57.170,00:36:58.590
"So now, what about f(0)?",00:36:58.590,00:37:00.650
"Well, if I plug in
0 here, I get 1 * 1.",00:37:00.650,00:37:04.350
So this thing is 1.,00:37:04.350,00:37:05.940
So that's no surprise.,00:37:05.940,00:37:07.550
And that's what I got.,00:37:07.550,00:37:11.260
"If I computed f',
by the product rule",00:37:11.260,00:37:15.600
"it would be an annoying,
somewhat long, computation.",00:37:15.600,00:37:19.150
"And because of
what we just done,",00:37:19.150,00:37:21.510
we know what it has to be.,00:37:21.510,00:37:23.130
It has to be negative 7/2.,00:37:23.130,00:37:25.990
"Because this is a
shortcut for doing it.",00:37:25.990,00:37:28.280
This is faster than doing that.,00:37:28.280,00:37:29.900
"But of course, that's a
legal way of doing it.",00:37:29.900,00:37:32.190
"When you get to
second derivatives,",00:37:32.190,00:37:33.780
"you'll quickly discover that
this method that I've just",00:37:33.780,00:37:36.210
"described is
complicated, but far",00:37:36.210,00:37:38.950
"superior to differentiating
this expression twice.",00:37:38.950,00:37:41.330

"JERISON: Would you have to
throw away an x^2 term if you",00:37:46.087,00:37:48.420
differentiated?,00:37:48.420,00:37:49.560
No.,00:37:49.560,00:37:50.470
"And in fact, we didn't
really have to do that here.",00:37:50.470,00:37:53.220
"If you differentiate
and then plug in x = 0.",00:37:53.220,00:37:55.385
"So if you differentiate
this and you plug in x = 0,",00:37:55.385,00:37:57.510
you get -7/2.,00:37:57.510,00:37:58.970
"You differentiate this
and you plug in x = 0,",00:37:58.970,00:38:01.349

out because it's just",00:38:01.349,00:38:03.140
a 3x when you differentiate.,00:38:03.140,00:38:05.370
"And then you plug in
x = 0, it's gone too.",00:38:05.370,00:38:08.270

up here, it goes away",00:38:08.270,00:38:10.650

here it goes away.",00:38:10.650,00:38:12.410
"So the higher-order terms never
influence this computation",00:38:12.410,00:38:18.555
here.,00:38:18.555,00:38:19.055
"This just captures the linear
features of the function.",00:38:19.055,00:38:27.430
"So now I want to go on to
quadratic approximation.",00:38:27.430,00:38:30.980
"And now we're going to
elaborate on this formula.",00:38:30.980,00:38:44.500
"So, linear approximation.",00:38:44.500,00:38:46.040
"Well, that should have
been linear approximation.",00:38:46.040,00:38:49.840
Liner.,00:38:49.840,00:38:50.530
That's interesting.,00:38:50.530,00:38:51.680
"OK, so that was wrong.",00:38:51.680,00:38:54.070
"But now we're going to
change it to quadratic.",00:38:54.070,00:38:59.700
"So, suppose we talk about a
quadratic approximation here.",00:38:59.700,00:39:04.280
"Now, the quadratic
approximation is",00:39:04.280,00:39:07.450
"going to be just an elaboration,
one more step of detail.",00:39:07.450,00:39:15.430
From the linear.,00:39:15.430,00:39:16.270
"In other words,
it's an extension",00:39:16.270,00:39:18.060
of the linear approximation.,00:39:18.060,00:39:20.230
"And so we're adding
one more term here.",00:39:20.230,00:39:24.320
"And the extra term
turns out to be related",00:39:24.320,00:39:26.650
to the second derivative.,00:39:26.650,00:39:28.990
But there's a factor of 2.,00:39:28.990,00:39:34.340
"So this is the formula for
the quadratic approximation.",00:39:34.340,00:39:39.090
"And this chunk of it, of
course, is the linear part.",00:39:39.090,00:39:46.450
"This time I'll spell
'linear' correctly.",00:39:46.450,00:39:54.190
"So the linear part
is the first piece.",00:39:54.190,00:39:56.030
"And the quadratic part
is the second piece.",00:39:56.030,00:40:05.050
"I want to develop this
same catalog of functions",00:40:05.050,00:40:09.630
as I had before.,00:40:09.630,00:40:11.140
"In other words, I want
to extend our formulas",00:40:11.140,00:40:14.640
to the higher-order terms.,00:40:14.640,00:40:19.660
"And if you do that
for this example here,",00:40:19.660,00:40:26.070
"maybe I'll even illustrate
with this example",00:40:26.070,00:40:28.180
"before I go on, if you
do it with this example",00:40:28.180,00:40:31.050
"here, just to give you a
flavor for what goes on,",00:40:31.050,00:40:39.320
what turns out to be the case.,00:40:39.320,00:40:41.140
So this is the linear version.,00:40:41.140,00:40:45.390
"And now I'm going to compare
it to the quadratic version.",00:40:45.390,00:40:48.220
"So the quadratic version
turns out to be this.",00:40:48.220,00:40:55.540
"That's what turns out to be
the quadratic approximation.",00:40:55.540,00:40:58.760
"And when I use
this example here,",00:40:58.760,00:41:03.100
"so this is 1.1, which is the
same as ln of 1 + 1/10, right?",00:41:03.100,00:41:09.400
"So that's approximately
1/10 - 1/2 (1/10)^2.",00:41:09.400,00:41:17.430
So 1/200.,00:41:17.430,00:41:19.170
"So that turns out,
instead of being",00:41:19.170,00:41:21.960
"1/10, that's point, what is it,
.095 or something like that.",00:41:21.960,00:41:29.160
It's a little bit less.,00:41:29.160,00:41:31.370
"It's not .1, but
it's pretty close.",00:41:31.370,00:41:36.240
"So if you like,
the correction is",00:41:36.240,00:41:39.350
lower in the decimal expansion.,00:41:39.350,00:41:48.900
"Now let me actually
check a few of these.",00:41:48.900,00:41:53.650
I'll carry them out.,00:41:53.650,00:41:54.940
"And what I'm going to
probably save for next time",00:41:54.940,00:41:58.670
"is explaining to you, so this
is why this factor of 1/2,",00:41:58.670,00:42:08.020
"and we're going
to do this later.",00:42:08.020,00:42:10.610
Do this next time.,00:42:10.610,00:42:11.530
"You can certainly do well to
stick with this presentation",00:42:11.530,00:42:17.230
for one more lecture.,00:42:17.230,00:42:18.470
So we can see this reinforced.,00:42:18.470,00:42:22.210
"So now I'm going to work
out these derivatives",00:42:22.210,00:42:32.580
of the higher-order terms.,00:42:32.580,00:42:34.630
"And let me do it for the
x approximately 0 case.",00:42:34.630,00:42:39.450
"So first of all, I want to
add in the extra term here.",00:42:39.450,00:42:47.990
Here's the extra term.,00:42:47.990,00:42:50.830
For the quadratic part.,00:42:50.830,00:42:53.780
"And now in order to figure
out what's going on,",00:42:53.780,00:42:57.050
"I'm going to need to compute,
also, second derivatives.",00:42:57.050,00:43:03.350
"So here I need a
second derivative.",00:43:03.350,00:43:05.150
"And I need to throw in the value
of that second derivative at 0.",00:43:05.150,00:43:11.465
"So this is what I'm
going to need to compute.",00:43:11.465,00:43:13.340
"So if I do it, for example,
for the sine function,",00:43:13.340,00:43:17.449
I already have the linear part.,00:43:17.449,00:43:18.740
I need this last bit.,00:43:18.740,00:43:20.290
"So I differentiate the
sine function twice",00:43:20.290,00:43:22.570
"and I get, I claim
minus the sine function.",00:43:22.570,00:43:25.180
"The first derivative
is the cosine",00:43:25.180,00:43:26.900
"and the cosine derivative
is minus the sine.",00:43:26.900,00:43:29.250
"And when I evaluate it at
0, I get, lo and behold, 0.",00:43:29.250,00:43:34.180
Sine of 0 is 0.,00:43:34.180,00:43:35.540
"So actually the quadratic
approximation is the same.",00:43:35.540,00:43:40.361
0x^2.,00:43:40.361,00:43:40.860
There's no x^2 term here.,00:43:40.860,00:43:43.070
"So that's why this is such
a terrific approximation.",00:43:43.070,00:43:46.510
"It's also the quadratic
approximation.",00:43:46.510,00:43:48.890
"For the cosine function,
if you differentiate twice,",00:43:48.890,00:43:53.460
"you get the derivative is
minus the sign and derivative",00:43:53.460,00:43:56.300
of that is minus the cosine.,00:43:56.300,00:44:00.170
So that's f''.,00:44:00.170,00:44:03.060
"And now, if I evaluate
that at 0, I get -1.",00:44:03.060,00:44:09.600
"And so the term that I
have to plug in here,",00:44:09.600,00:44:11.530
"this -1 is the coefficient
that appears right here.",00:44:11.530,00:44:15.240
So I need a -1/2 x^2 extra.,00:44:15.240,00:44:23.350
"And if you do it for
the e^x, you get an e^x,",00:44:23.350,00:44:26.100
"and you got a 1 and so
you get 1/2 x^2 here.",00:44:26.100,00:44:39.450
"I'm going to finish these
two in just a second,",00:44:39.450,00:44:42.329
"but I first want
to tell you about",00:44:42.329,00:44:43.745
"the geometric significance
of this quadratic term.",00:44:43.745,00:44:56.480
So here we go.,00:44:56.480,00:44:58.790
"Geometric significance
(of the quadratic term).",00:44:58.790,00:45:18.430
"So the geometric
significance is best",00:45:18.430,00:45:21.100
"to describe just by
drawing a picture here.",00:45:21.100,00:45:25.670
"And I'm going to draw the
picture of the cosine function.",00:45:25.670,00:45:29.300
"And remember we already
had the tangent line.",00:45:29.300,00:45:34.270
"So the tangent line was
this horizontal here.",00:45:34.270,00:45:38.620
And that was y = 1.,00:45:38.620,00:45:40.350
"But you can see intuitively,
that doesn't even",00:45:40.350,00:45:42.880
"tell you whether this function
is above or below 1 there.",00:45:42.880,00:45:46.130
Doesn't tell you much.,00:45:46.130,00:45:47.437
"It's sort of begging for there
to be a little more information",00:45:47.437,00:45:50.020
"to tell us what the
function is doing nearby.",00:45:50.020,00:45:52.470
"And indeed, that's what this
second expression does for us.",00:45:52.470,00:45:57.470
"It's some kind of
parabola underneath here.",00:45:57.470,00:46:00.850
So this is y = 1 - 1/2 x^2.,00:46:00.850,00:46:05.420
"Which is a much better
fit to the curve",00:46:05.420,00:46:08.890
than the horizontal line.,00:46:08.890,00:46:12.740
"And this is, if you like,
this is the best fit parabola.",00:46:12.740,00:46:23.750
"So it's going to be the
closest parabola to the curve.",00:46:23.750,00:46:28.510
"And that's more or
less the significance.",00:46:28.510,00:46:31.370
"It's much, much closer.",00:46:31.370,00:46:34.600
"All right, I want
to give you, well,",00:46:34.600,00:46:40.220
"I think we'll save these other
derivations for next time",00:46:40.220,00:46:43.040
"because I think we're
out of time now.",00:46:43.040,00:46:44.880
So we'll do these next time.,00:46:44.880,00:46:47.110
