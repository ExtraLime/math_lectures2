PROFESSOR: All right.,00:00:20.695,00:00:21.570
"Good morning, everyone.",00:00:21.570,00:00:23.150
Thanks for coming on quiz day.,00:00:23.150,00:00:25.450
"I have to have someone
to throw Frisbees to.",00:00:25.450,00:00:28.680
Empty chairs would be difficult.,00:00:28.680,00:00:32.049
"So we're going to be doing
dynamic programming, a notion",00:00:32.049,00:00:36.220
you've learned in 6006.,00:00:36.220,00:00:40.090
"We'll look at three
different examples today.",00:00:40.090,00:00:43.010
"The first one is really
at the level of 006,",00:00:43.010,00:00:46.570
"a cute little problem on
finding the longest palindromic",00:00:46.570,00:00:51.190
"sequence inside of
a longer sequence.",00:00:51.190,00:00:56.630
"Sometimes it's called longest
palindromic subsequence.",00:00:56.630,00:01:00.250
"And as we'll talk
about, subsequence",00:01:00.250,00:01:03.310
"means that it can
be non-contiguous.",00:01:03.310,00:01:06.520
"So you could skip letters
in a sequence of letters",00:01:06.520,00:01:12.840
"and you would still have a
subsequence corresponding",00:01:12.840,00:01:16.770
to that.,00:01:16.770,00:01:17.480
Don't have to be contiguous.,00:01:17.480,00:01:19.100
"And then we'll raise
the stakes a little bit.",00:01:19.100,00:01:21.840
"So each of these problems gets
progressively more complicated,",00:01:21.840,00:01:27.530
more sophisticated.,00:01:27.530,00:01:29.010
"And you'll probably
see problems here,",00:01:29.010,00:01:32.950
"at least alternating coin
game, that are beyond 006",00:01:32.950,00:01:37.070
"in the sense that
it wasn't covered.",00:01:37.070,00:01:39.270
"Those kinds of notions
weren't covered in 006.",00:01:39.270,00:01:42.290
"So just in terms of
review, I wrote this",00:01:42.290,00:01:45.830
"up here because I don't want
to spend a whole lot of time",00:01:45.830,00:01:48.940
on it.,00:01:48.940,00:01:49.760
"This is something that you
should have some familiarity",00:01:49.760,00:01:52.300
"with from the
recitation, for example,",00:01:52.300,00:01:57.590
"that you had on
Friday and from 006.",00:01:57.590,00:02:00.880
"Dynamic programming is
this wonderful hammer.",00:02:00.880,00:02:03.600
"It's an algorithmic
technique that you",00:02:03.600,00:02:05.960
"can use to solve problems that
look exponential in complexity.",00:02:05.960,00:02:11.390
"But if you can find this
optimum substructure associated",00:02:11.390,00:02:15.210
"with the problem and its
connection to it's subproblems,",00:02:15.210,00:02:20.060
"and if you can
characterize that,",00:02:20.060,00:02:22.080
"then you can do a recursive
decomposition of the problem",00:02:22.080,00:02:26.410
"where you show that you can
construct the optimum solution",00:02:26.410,00:02:33.200
from the subproblems.,00:02:33.200,00:02:34.660
"And that's really the key
step in dynamic programming,",00:02:34.660,00:02:38.480
is step two.,00:02:38.480,00:02:40.070
"Once you've made this
characterization,",00:02:40.070,00:02:42.570
"you write this recurrence out
that relates the optimal value",00:02:42.570,00:02:48.630
"of a bigger problem to the
optimal values of subproblems.",00:02:48.630,00:02:53.950
"And you compute the value
of the optimal solution",00:02:53.950,00:02:58.440
through a recursive memoization.,00:02:58.440,00:03:04.800
"And that memoization
is really what",00:03:04.800,00:03:07.750
"gives you the
efficient algorithm,",00:03:07.750,00:03:12.040
"because you don't repeat
the solution of subproblems.",00:03:12.040,00:03:16.540
"You can also do this in
an iterative fashion.",00:03:16.540,00:03:19.640
"Essentially, you're going to
be computing things bottom-up.",00:03:19.640,00:03:22.620
"You might want to think
about it as top-down",00:03:22.620,00:03:24.890
when you write your recurrence.,00:03:24.890,00:03:26.790
"But ultimately, when you
actually execute the program,",00:03:26.790,00:03:29.800
"you'll be computing
things bottom-up,",00:03:29.800,00:03:31.690
"and you'll be checking the memo
table to see if you actually",00:03:31.690,00:03:35.320
solved this problem before.,00:03:35.320,00:03:37.340
"And that would be the
recursive memoized case,",00:03:37.340,00:03:41.340
"which, in some sense,
is a little bit easier",00:03:41.340,00:03:43.430
"to think about and translate
directly from the recurrence.",00:03:43.430,00:03:46.750
"But the other way to do it
is to do it iteratively.",00:03:46.750,00:03:49.170
"And we'll take a look
for this first problem",00:03:49.170,00:03:51.590
"as to how you'd do the two
different ways at least",00:03:51.590,00:03:55.110
"from a conceptual standpoint,
even though I might not",00:03:55.110,00:03:58.720
"write out the code for
each of those cases.",00:03:58.720,00:04:01.400
"So a couple of choices
here, recurse and memoize,",00:04:01.400,00:04:04.880
"or essentially do
it iteratively.",00:04:04.880,00:04:08.726
"And the smaller
subproblems would",00:04:08.726,00:04:10.100
"have to get computed
first in both approaches.",00:04:10.100,00:04:16.279
"The one thing that sometimes we
don't spend a whole lot of time",00:04:16.279,00:04:18.910
"on is this last step, which
is getting the exact solution.",00:04:18.910,00:04:25.210
"So a lot of the time,
you stop with saying,",00:04:25.210,00:04:27.570
"I can compute the value
of the optimum solution,",00:04:27.570,00:04:31.030
"the value in terms of
the length of the longest",00:04:31.030,00:04:34.740
palindromic sequence is 7 or 9.,00:04:34.740,00:04:38.770
"But what is that
sequence or subsequence?",00:04:38.770,00:04:42.270
"That requires some
additional coding,",00:04:42.270,00:04:45.640
some additional accounting.,00:04:45.640,00:04:48.710
"The construction of
this optimal solution",00:04:48.710,00:04:51.100
"typically requires
some back-tracing",00:04:51.100,00:04:53.530
"and some information
to be kept track",00:04:53.530,00:04:58.200
"of during the recurse
and memoize step",00:04:58.200,00:05:00.590
or during the iterative step.,00:05:00.590,00:05:02.491
"So that's something
to keep in mind.",00:05:02.491,00:05:03.990
"You're not quite
done once you've",00:05:03.990,00:05:06.160
"found the value of
the optimum solution.",00:05:06.160,00:05:08.870
"More often than not,
you want the solution.",00:05:08.870,00:05:11.250
"So we'll talk about that
as well a little bit.",00:05:11.250,00:05:14.260
"But let's just dive in and look
at this cute, little problem",00:05:14.260,00:05:21.824
of longest palindromic sequence.,00:05:21.824,00:05:27.280
"And palindromes, of course,
read the same front to back",00:05:27.280,00:05:35.140
or back to front.,00:05:35.140,00:05:36.220
Radar is a palindrome.,00:05:36.220,00:05:38.530
"Just as a trivial example, a
single letter is a palindrome.",00:05:38.530,00:05:43.890
"Maybe I should have used a
since that's actually a word.",00:05:43.890,00:05:48.440
But here I got bb.,00:05:48.440,00:05:50.890
"That's definitely not
a word, at least not",00:05:50.890,00:05:54.090
"a word that-- acronym, maybe.",00:05:54.090,00:05:57.670
Radar is a palindrome.,00:05:57.670,00:06:00.690
"Able was I 'ere I
saw Elba, right?",00:06:00.690,00:06:03.080
That's a palindrome.,00:06:03.080,00:06:05.180
"That's, of course,
not a single word.",00:06:05.180,00:06:06.870
"But it's a famous
palindrome, days of Napoleon.",00:06:06.870,00:06:11.680
"But what we're
trying to do here is,",00:06:11.680,00:06:13.660
"given that we have this
notion of a palindrome,",00:06:13.660,00:06:17.220
"we'd like to discover
palindromes inside longer",00:06:17.220,00:06:22.400
words or longer sequences.,00:06:22.400,00:06:24.700
"So what we have is a string,
and we'll call it x1 through n,",00:06:24.700,00:06:33.921
n greater than or equal to 1.,00:06:33.921,00:06:37.305
"And we want to find the
longest palindrome that",00:06:37.305,00:06:45.920
is a subsequence.,00:06:45.920,00:06:46.720
"And so here's an example
to get you guys warmed up.",00:06:50.420,00:06:54.290
"We'll have a couple of
puzzles here in a second.",00:06:54.290,00:06:58.050
So character.,00:06:58.050,00:06:59.720
"And you want to find
the longest palindrome.",00:06:59.720,00:07:03.420
"And so you go, I'll pick c,
I'll skip h, I'll pick a,",00:07:03.420,00:07:07.450
"I'll pick r, a, and c.",00:07:07.450,00:07:10.150
"And carac, which I guess
is not a word either--",00:07:10.150,00:07:15.020
"but it's the longest
palindrome that corresponds",00:07:15.020,00:07:21.000
to a subsequence of character.,00:07:21.000,00:07:24.190
Right?,00:07:24.190,00:07:24.690
"So the game here,
as you can see,",00:07:24.690,00:07:27.660
"is to pick the letters that
form the palindrome and drop",00:07:27.660,00:07:33.670
the ones that don't.,00:07:33.670,00:07:35.860
OK?,00:07:35.860,00:07:36.420
"And we're going to have to use
dynamic programming to do this.",00:07:36.420,00:07:40.630
"The answer will be greater
than or-- 1 in length",00:07:40.630,00:07:46.760
"because we've defined a
single letter as a palindrome.",00:07:46.760,00:07:51.640
"So it has to be-- if you have
one letter in the input, well,",00:07:51.640,00:07:55.660
you just pick that letter.,00:07:55.660,00:07:56.896
"But regardless of how many
letters you have on the input,",00:07:56.896,00:07:59.270
"greater than or
equal to 1, you know",00:07:59.270,00:08:00.920
"that you're going to get
at least a one letter",00:08:00.920,00:08:03.980
palindrome at the output.,00:08:03.980,00:08:06.740
So here we go.,00:08:06.740,00:08:08.330
"Let's say I have under-- and
this is thanks to Eric here.",00:08:11.610,00:08:17.900
"I've got a couple of nice
words-- underqualified.",00:08:17.900,00:08:22.350
"The person who gets me
the longest palindrome",00:08:22.350,00:08:25.310
wins a Frisbee.,00:08:25.310,00:08:27.400
"And if you want to code dynamic
programming in the next two",00:08:27.400,00:08:30.040
"minutes and run it
on your laptops,",00:08:30.040,00:08:33.159
that's perfectly fine with me.,00:08:33.159,00:08:34.870
That's not cheating.,00:08:34.870,00:08:37.909
So underqualified.,00:08:37.909,00:08:40.450
So u is a palindrome.,00:08:40.450,00:08:41.549
So we got that.,00:08:41.549,00:08:42.539
Right?,00:08:42.539,00:08:43.039
So one letter for sure.,00:08:43.039,00:08:45.300
What else?,00:08:45.300,00:08:46.430
What's the longest palindrome?,00:08:46.430,00:08:47.790

obvious in this case,",00:11:35.550,00:11:38.370
"because I'm going to
have to go in order.",00:11:38.370,00:11:41.120
Right?,00:11:41.120,00:11:41.620
I mean that's the constraint.,00:11:41.620,00:11:42.980
"A subsequence does maintain
the ordering constraint.",00:11:42.980,00:11:46.700
"It's not like I can
invert these letters.",00:11:46.700,00:11:48.486
"That would be a
different problem",00:11:48.486,00:11:49.860
if I allowed you to do that.,00:11:49.860,00:11:51.420
"So I'm going to start somewhere,
and I'm going to end somewhere.",00:11:51.420,00:11:55.260
"And I want to have a
non-null subsequence,",00:11:55.260,00:11:57.630
"so I'm going to have i
less than or equal to j.",00:11:57.630,00:11:59.730
"I'm good with i being
equal to j, because I still",00:11:59.730,00:12:02.560
"have one letter, and, well,
that happens to be a palindrome,",00:12:02.560,00:12:05.740
and it'll have a length of 1.,00:12:05.740,00:12:07.740
So that's my lij.,00:12:07.740,00:12:10.380
"And what I want to do is
define a recursive algorithm",00:12:10.380,00:12:17.950
that computes lij.,00:12:17.950,00:12:20.610
"So we'll just try and figure out
what the recurrence looks like,",00:12:20.610,00:12:25.360
"and then we can talk about
memoization or iteration.",00:12:25.360,00:12:31.220
"So if i equals
equals j, then I'm",00:12:31.220,00:12:36.680
"going to return
1, because I know",00:12:36.680,00:12:39.270
"that that's a palindrome
by default. So that's easy.",00:12:39.270,00:12:43.970
"And what do you think
the next check should be?",00:12:43.970,00:12:48.640
"If I look at this
x sequence, and I",00:12:48.640,00:12:51.410
"have i as the starting point
and j as the next point,",00:12:51.410,00:12:55.300
"what do you think the next check
is going to be once I have--",00:12:55.300,00:12:58.150
if i is not equal to j?,00:12:58.150,00:13:01.965
"AUDIENCE: If x of i equals x
of j, then j equals as well.",00:13:01.965,00:13:07.082
PROFESSOR: Sorry.,00:13:07.082,00:13:07.790
What was that again?,00:13:07.790,00:13:08.623
"AUDIENCE: If x of
i equals x plus--",00:13:08.623,00:13:10.865
PROFESSOR: Beautiful.,00:13:10.865,00:13:11.740
"You're just checking
to see-- you're just",00:13:11.740,00:13:14.240
"checking to see whether the
two endpoints are equal or not.",00:13:14.240,00:13:19.260
"Because if they're
equal, then you",00:13:19.260,00:13:21.610
"can essentially
grab those letters",00:13:21.610,00:13:26.270
"and say that you're
going to be looking",00:13:26.270,00:13:29.590
"at a smaller subsequence that is
going to get you a palindrome.",00:13:29.590,00:13:37.480
"And you're going to be able
to add these two letters that",00:13:37.480,00:13:40.090
"are equal on either side
of the computed palindrome",00:13:40.090,00:13:43.650
from the subsequence.,00:13:43.650,00:13:45.300
"So if x of i equals equals x
of j, then I'm going to say,",00:13:45.300,00:13:57.380
"if i plus 1 equals
equals j, I'm going",00:13:57.380,00:14:02.710
"to go ahead and return
2, because at that point,",00:14:02.710,00:14:08.770
I'm done.,00:14:08.770,00:14:10.900
There's nothing else to do.,00:14:10.900,00:14:13.170
"Else I'm going to return 2
plus L of i plus 1 j minus 1.",00:14:13.170,00:14:26.920
So I'm going to look inside.,00:14:26.920,00:14:28.500
"And I've got these two letters
on either side that are equal.",00:14:28.500,00:14:32.290
"So I can always prepend
to the palindrome",00:14:32.290,00:14:35.890
"I got from here the letter, and
then append the same letter.",00:14:35.890,00:14:40.830
"And I got 2 plus whatever value
I got from this quantity here.",00:14:40.830,00:14:47.630
"So so far, it's not
really particularly",00:14:47.630,00:14:51.740
"interesting from a
standpoint of constructing",00:14:51.740,00:14:55.160
the optimum solution.,00:14:55.160,00:14:56.710
"But this last line that we have
here, where we have the case",00:14:56.710,00:15:01.050
"that the two letters
are not equal",00:15:01.050,00:15:03.976
"is the most interesting
line of code.",00:15:03.976,00:15:06.470
"That's the most interesting
aspect of this algorithm.",00:15:06.470,00:15:09.080
"So does someone tell
me what this line",00:15:09.080,00:15:12.290
is going to be out here?,00:15:12.290,00:15:14.100
"Yeah, go ahead.",00:15:14.100,00:15:15.427
"AUDIENCE: If x of L i plus
1j or L i [INAUDIBLE].",00:15:15.427,00:15:20.225
PROFESSOR: Beautiful.,00:15:20.225,00:15:21.100
That's exactly right.,00:15:21.100,00:15:22.060
"So what you're going to
do is you're going to say,",00:15:22.060,00:15:24.143
"I need to look at two
different subproblems,",00:15:24.143,00:15:26.700
"and I need to evaluate
both of these subproblems.",00:15:26.700,00:15:31.110
"And the first subproblem is
I'm going to-- since these two",00:15:31.110,00:15:33.700
"letters are different, I'm going
to have to drop one of them.",00:15:33.700,00:15:37.710
And I'm going to look inside.,00:15:37.710,00:15:39.470
"I'm going to say--
in this case, I'm",00:15:39.470,00:15:41.670
"going to drop the
i-th letter, and I'm",00:15:41.670,00:15:44.890
going to get L i plus 1j.,00:15:44.890,00:15:47.540
"And in the second case, I'm
going to drop the j-th letter,",00:15:47.540,00:15:51.360
and I'm going to get ij minus 1.,00:15:51.360,00:15:54.930
And that's it.,00:15:54.930,00:15:56.090
So it's a max.,00:15:56.090,00:15:57.730
"And there's nothing
that's being added here,",00:15:57.730,00:16:00.340
"because those two letters, one
of them had to get dropped.",00:16:00.340,00:16:04.270
"They weren't equal, so one
of them had to get dropped.",00:16:04.270,00:16:07.220
"So you're not adding
anything to this.",00:16:07.220,00:16:10.450
So that's good.,00:16:10.450,00:16:11.440
"And at this point,
you're kind of done.",00:16:11.440,00:16:13.760
Right?,00:16:13.760,00:16:14.260
Whoops.,00:16:17.810,00:16:18.310
"Oh, nice catch.",00:16:18.310,00:16:20.000
But you did drop something.,00:16:20.000,00:16:21.470
All right.,00:16:24.290,00:16:24.790
"So the thing that we've done
here is gotten to step three.",00:16:24.790,00:16:32.860
"So just to be clear, we're
not done-done, in terms",00:16:32.860,00:16:36.260
"of this chart here, because
we don't have the code there",00:16:36.260,00:16:40.760
"that corresponds to actually
computing the sequence.",00:16:40.760,00:16:47.990
So it's not that hard.,00:16:47.990,00:16:49.980
"I'm not going to go
over the code here.",00:16:49.980,00:16:54.510
"You can certainly look
at it in the notes.",00:16:54.510,00:16:58.020
"But you need a
little bit of tracing",00:16:58.020,00:17:01.420
"backwards in this recursion
to actually compute things.",00:17:01.420,00:17:06.540
"What is the complexity of
what I wrote up there, though?",00:17:06.540,00:17:10.211
Yeah?,00:17:10.211,00:17:10.710
AUDIENCE: Theta n squared?,00:17:10.710,00:17:12.200
PROFESSOR: Theta n squared.,00:17:12.200,00:17:13.359
"Do people agree that the
complexity is theta n squared?",00:17:13.359,00:17:16.030
"Or is this gentleman
an optimist?",00:17:16.030,00:17:17.479
"Is the complexity
theta n squared?",00:17:21.619,00:17:23.390
"Tell me why the complexity
is theta n squared?",00:17:23.390,00:17:25.639
"AUDIENCE: Because
each subproblem",00:17:25.639,00:17:27.106
"is-- that code right there just
executed by itself is constant.",00:17:27.106,00:17:30.615
"But then there's theta
n squared subproblems.",00:17:30.615,00:17:32.490
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.,00:17:32.490,00:17:33.406
"But if you actually implemented
this code, and you ran it,",00:17:33.406,00:17:37.870
"and n was 100,
how long would you",00:17:37.870,00:17:41.780
wait for this code to complete?,00:17:41.780,00:17:43.205
Look at it.,00:17:47.300,00:17:48.800
What's missing?,00:17:48.800,00:17:49.915
AUDIENCE: The cache.,00:17:49.915,00:17:51.160
"PROFESSOR: The cache, exactly.",00:17:51.160,00:17:52.790
"Well, you fixed your
own little error there.",00:17:52.790,00:17:57.580
It was a trick question.,00:17:57.580,00:17:59.290
"So there's no recursion-- I'm
sorry, there's recursion here,",00:17:59.290,00:18:01.790
but no memoization.,00:18:01.790,00:18:03.940
"So this is exponential
complexity.",00:18:03.940,00:18:06.810
You will recur.,00:18:06.810,00:18:08.890
"In fact, the recurrence for
that is something like T of n",00:18:08.890,00:18:14.730
"equals 1 if n equals 1, and 2T
n minus 1 if n greater than 1.",00:18:14.730,00:18:23.310
"And this would be 2 raised
to n minus 1 in complexity.",00:18:23.310,00:18:27.850
"Now there's a
single line of code,",00:18:27.850,00:18:29.560
"and you all know this,
that would fix this.",00:18:29.560,00:18:32.510
"And that single line of code
is simply something that says,",00:18:32.510,00:18:36.690
"right here, look at
the lij-- and I'm",00:18:36.690,00:18:43.869
writing this differently.,00:18:43.869,00:18:44.910
I'm calling this now a 2D array.,00:18:44.910,00:18:48.860
"So that's why I have the open
brackets and close brackets.",00:18:48.860,00:18:51.440
So I'm overloading l here.,00:18:51.440,00:18:53.380
"But it's a 2D
array that is going",00:18:53.380,00:18:55.920
"to essentially be a cache for
the subproblem solution values.",00:18:55.920,00:19:03.420
"And then if you want to do the
backtracing to actually compute",00:19:03.420,00:19:07.500
"the solution, you
could certainly",00:19:07.500,00:19:09.220
"have that as an additional
record that's connected",00:19:09.220,00:19:12.310
to this very same value.,00:19:12.310,00:19:14.070
"But that's implementation,
and we won't really go there.",00:19:14.070,00:19:17.900
"So look at lij and don't
recurse if lij already computed.",00:19:17.900,00:19:26.990
OK.,00:19:32.270,00:19:34.920
So that's important to remember.,00:19:34.920,00:19:37.180
"Now, if you actually put that,
the cache lookup, hash table",00:19:37.180,00:19:41.900
"lookup, array lookup,
whatever you want to call it,",00:19:41.900,00:19:45.160
"out there, then what you
said is exactly correct.",00:19:45.160,00:19:48.740
"So our formula for computing
the complexity of a DP,",00:19:48.740,00:19:56.740
"that you've seen
a bunch of times",00:19:56.740,00:19:59.360
"and I mentioned in the
very first lecture as well,",00:19:59.360,00:20:01.930
"is number of
subproblems times time",00:20:01.930,00:20:10.860
"to solve each
subproblem assuming",00:20:10.860,00:20:18.920
"or given that smaller
ones are solved",00:20:18.920,00:20:28.220
or the lookup is Order 1.,00:20:28.220,00:20:30.760
So lookup.,00:20:30.760,00:20:31.610
"Now you could say
that hash table",00:20:37.520,00:20:39.020
"lookup is Order 1 on average,
et cetera, et cetera.",00:20:39.020,00:20:42.180
"So what actually happens
in the worst case,",00:20:42.180,00:20:45.170
"in this particular
case and in most DPs,",00:20:45.170,00:20:48.610
"you can do things
like perfect caching",00:20:48.610,00:20:53.160
"or, something that's even
simpler in this case,",00:20:53.160,00:20:55.170
is just a 2D array.,00:20:55.170,00:20:56.610
"There's not going to be any
collisions if you just use i",00:20:56.610,00:20:59.070
"and j as the indices
to the array.",00:20:59.070,00:21:00.810
"So you will definitely get an
Order 1 lookup in this case,",00:21:00.810,00:21:05.390
"in most problems
we'll look at in 046.",00:21:05.390,00:21:08.510
"So if we just do that
computation, which",00:21:08.510,00:21:14.280
"my friend over here
just described,",00:21:14.280,00:21:16.580
"you do get your theta n
squared, because you have",00:21:16.580,00:21:19.640
theta n squared subproblems.,00:21:19.640,00:21:22.040
"And time to solve
each subproblem, given",00:21:22.040,00:21:29.400
"that the smaller
ones are solved,",00:21:29.400,00:21:31.640
"is simply going to
be a computation",00:21:31.640,00:21:34.070
of a max and an addition.,00:21:34.070,00:21:37.820
"So all of that is theta
1, because you're not",00:21:37.820,00:21:40.600
counting the recursive calls.,00:21:40.600,00:21:43.390
So this is our first example.,00:21:43.390,00:21:46.610
I'm done with it.,00:21:46.610,00:21:48.560
Any questions about it?,00:21:48.560,00:21:50.760
"Any questions about
DP in general?",00:21:50.760,00:21:54.746
"All right, good.",00:21:54.746,00:21:56.500
So little bit of review there.,00:21:56.500,00:22:00.440
"Not a particularly
complicated question.",00:22:00.440,00:22:02.860
"Let's go to a different
question corresponding",00:22:02.860,00:22:06.600
to optimal binary search trees.,00:22:06.600,00:22:09.570
It's a very different question.,00:22:09.570,00:22:11.854
"I don't think I
need this anymore.",00:22:11.854,00:22:13.270
"And it's kind of
cute in its own way.",00:22:17.020,00:22:18.724
"One of things that's
interesting about this question",00:22:18.724,00:22:20.890
"is it seems like a greedy
algorithm should work.",00:22:20.890,00:22:27.150
"And we'll talk about that, as
to why the greedy algorithm",00:22:27.150,00:22:31.460
doesn't quite work.,00:22:31.460,00:22:33.010
"So it's kind of similar
to the interval scheduling",00:22:33.010,00:22:36.050
"and the weighted interval
scheduling problem",00:22:36.050,00:22:38.520
"that we had back
in February, where",00:22:38.520,00:22:42.990
"the regular interval scheduling
problem, greedy worked,",00:22:42.990,00:22:46.300
earliest finish time worked.,00:22:46.300,00:22:47.740
"But when it came
to weights, we had",00:22:47.740,00:22:49.480
"to graduate to
dynamic programming.",00:22:49.480,00:22:53.550
"So here's our second
problem, optimal BSTs.",00:22:53.550,00:22:59.460
So what is an optimal BST?,00:22:59.460,00:23:02.960
"We have a bunch of keys that
we want to store in the BST, K1",00:23:02.960,00:23:10.590
through Kn.,00:23:10.590,00:23:12.020
"And we'll assume that
the way this is set up",00:23:12.020,00:23:15.540
"is that K1 is less than K2,
da, da, da, less than Kn.",00:23:15.540,00:23:19.440
"And just to make our life
easier in our examples,",00:23:19.440,00:23:22.240
we just assume that Ki equals i.,00:23:22.240,00:23:26.260
"That's not necessarily
required for anything",00:23:26.260,00:23:29.510
we're going to do next.,00:23:29.510,00:23:30.520
"It's just for the
sake of examples",00:23:30.520,00:23:32.850
and keeping things manageable.,00:23:32.850,00:23:35.080
So I got a bunch of keys.,00:23:35.080,00:23:37.080
"And clearly there are many
different binary search trees",00:23:37.080,00:23:40.670
"that can come, whether they're
balanced or unbalanced.",00:23:40.670,00:23:45.460
"Many different
binary search trees",00:23:45.460,00:23:47.550
"can be consistent with
a given set of keys.",00:23:47.550,00:23:52.070
"If I choose the root
to be Kn, then I'm",00:23:52.070,00:23:55.840
"going to get this
horribly unbalanced tree.",00:23:55.840,00:23:58.680
"If I chose the root to be
somewhere in the middle,",00:23:58.680,00:24:00.764
"then I'm going to
get something that",00:24:00.764,00:24:02.263
"looks a little better, at
least at the top level.",00:24:02.263,00:24:04.540
"But again, if I messed
it up at the next level,",00:24:04.540,00:24:07.780
"I'd get something
that's unbalanced.",00:24:07.780,00:24:10.110
"So there's clearly
many different BSTs.",00:24:10.110,00:24:13.200
"I'm not talking about
balanced BSTs here.",00:24:13.200,00:24:15.300
"But we're going to define an
optimality criterion that's",00:24:15.300,00:24:17.870
"a little bit different
from balanced BSTs,",00:24:17.870,00:24:20.720
"because it's going to
have this additional cost",00:24:20.720,00:24:23.430
"function associated
with it that corresponds",00:24:23.430,00:24:25.500
to the weight of the keys.,00:24:25.500,00:24:28.380
So what is that?,00:24:28.380,00:24:30.460
"Well, I'm going to
have weights associated",00:24:30.460,00:24:34.890
"with each of these keys
corresponding to W1 through Wn.",00:24:34.890,00:24:41.260
"And the easiest
way to motivate you",00:24:41.260,00:24:49.490
"to think that these weights
are an interesting addition",00:24:49.490,00:24:53.700
"to this problem is to
think about these weights",00:24:53.700,00:24:56.110
as being search probabilities.,00:24:56.110,00:24:58.120
"So what you have,
for argument's sake,",00:24:58.120,00:25:00.630
"is a static structure
that you've created.",00:25:00.630,00:25:06.090
"I mean, you could modify it.",00:25:06.090,00:25:07.570
"There's nothing that's
stopping you from doing that.",00:25:07.570,00:25:09.736
"But let's just pretend for now
that it's a static structure",00:25:09.736,00:25:12.750
"corresponding to this BST--
has a particular structure.",00:25:12.750,00:25:16.170
"And chances are you're going
to be searching for some keys",00:25:16.170,00:25:20.590
more frequently than others.,00:25:20.590,00:25:22.930
"And the Wi's tell you
what the probabilities",00:25:22.930,00:25:26.230
"are in terms of searching
for a particular key Ki.",00:25:26.230,00:25:30.300
"So you can imagine, and
we won't have this here,",00:25:30.300,00:25:32.670
"that you take-- the
Wi's all sum up to 1,",00:25:32.670,00:25:35.474
"if you want to think of
them as probabilities.",00:25:35.474,00:25:37.390
"Or I'm just going
to give you numbers.",00:25:37.390,00:25:39.899
"I don't want to deal with
fractions, don't particularly",00:25:39.899,00:25:42.190
like fractions.,00:25:42.190,00:25:43.620
"So you can imagine that
each probability corresponds",00:25:43.620,00:25:46.770
"to Wi divided by the sum
of all the Wi's, if you",00:25:46.770,00:25:50.740
"want all of the
probabilities to sum up to 1.",00:25:50.740,00:25:53.657
"So think of them as
search probabilities,",00:25:53.657,00:25:55.365
"because then you'll see what
the point of this exercise is.",00:25:55.365,00:26:00.450
"And the point of
this exercise is",00:26:00.450,00:26:03.310
"to find the BST T-- so
we're actually constructing",00:26:03.310,00:26:08.390
a binary search tree here.,00:26:08.390,00:26:09.970
"So it's a little more
interesting than a subsequence,",00:26:09.970,00:26:12.500
"for example-- it has a richer
structure associated with it--",00:26:12.500,00:26:15.280
"than an exponential number
of possible binary search",00:26:15.280,00:26:17.690
"trees that are associated
with a given set of n keys",00:26:17.690,00:26:20.680
"that are all binary
search trees.",00:26:20.680,00:26:22.620
"They're consistent, unbalanced,
balanced-- unbalanced",00:26:22.620,00:26:25.950
"in one way versus another
way, et cetera, et cetera.",00:26:25.950,00:26:29.130
"So we want to find a
binary search tree T",00:26:29.130,00:26:33.220
"that minimizes sigma
i equals 1 through n.",00:26:33.220,00:26:42.400
"Obviously, we're going to have
this Wi that's the game here.",00:26:42.400,00:26:46.730
"Depth in that T-- so this
depth is for that T. What",00:26:46.730,00:26:52.710
is the depth of the node?,00:26:52.710,00:26:54.840
And K of i plus 1.,00:26:54.840,00:26:58.200
"And I'll explain
exactly what this",00:27:00.830,00:27:02.760
"and tell you what
precisely the depth is.",00:27:02.760,00:27:05.710
"But roughly speaking,
the depth of the root--",00:27:05.710,00:27:09.345
not roughly speaking.,00:27:09.345,00:27:10.220
The depth of the root is 0.,00:27:10.220,00:27:13.330
"And the depth of
1 below the root",00:27:13.330,00:27:16.490
"is 1, and so on and so forth.",00:27:16.490,00:27:19.340
"And so, as you can
see, what you want",00:27:19.340,00:27:21.420
"to do is collect in--
roughly speaking,",00:27:21.420,00:27:24.670
"you want to collect the high
weight nodes to have low depth.",00:27:24.670,00:27:29.620
"If Wi is high, you want
the multiplicative factor",00:27:29.620,00:27:35.010
"corresponding to depth T
of that node, i, i-th node,",00:27:35.010,00:27:39.590
to be small.,00:27:39.590,00:27:40.580
"And if Wi is small, then you
don't mind the depth number",00:27:40.580,00:27:47.110
to be higher.,00:27:47.110,00:27:48.320
"You only have a certain
number of low-depth nodes.",00:27:48.320,00:27:53.140
"You only have one
node of depth 0.",00:27:53.140,00:27:56.580
"And you have two nodes of depth
1, which means that you only",00:27:56.580,00:28:00.810
"have one node where
that quantity there",00:28:00.810,00:28:03.000
"is going to be 1, because
you're doing 0 plus 1.",00:28:03.000,00:28:05.757
"And you have two nodes
where the quantity",00:28:05.757,00:28:07.465
"is going to be 2, and
so on and so forth.",00:28:07.465,00:28:10.920
"So you have some room here
to play with corresponding",00:28:10.920,00:28:13.520
"to the BST structure, and you
want to minimize that quantity.",00:28:13.520,00:28:18.380
Any questions so far?,00:28:18.380,00:28:19.330
"All right, good.",00:28:22.090,00:28:24.140
"So the search probabilities
would be an example.",00:28:24.140,00:28:28.020
"So in terms of a more
concrete application,",00:28:28.020,00:28:31.640
"you could imagine you had a
dictionary, English to French,",00:28:31.640,00:28:35.670
"French to English,
what have you.",00:28:35.670,00:28:37.670
"And there are obviously
words that are more common,",00:28:37.670,00:28:41.830
"let's say, in common
speech than others,",00:28:41.830,00:28:45.650
"and you do want to do the
translation in a dynamic way",00:28:45.650,00:28:48.990
using this data structure.,00:28:48.990,00:28:50.620
"And you could imagine
that in this case,",00:28:50.620,00:28:52.880
"the search probability
of a word is associated",00:28:52.880,00:28:57.870
"with the occurrence of the
word, the number of times",00:28:57.870,00:29:03.630
"over some normalized
number of words",00:29:03.630,00:29:06.960
"that this particular
word occurs.",00:29:06.960,00:29:09.180
And that would be the way.,00:29:09.180,00:29:11.450
"So it makes sense to
create a structure that",00:29:11.450,00:29:14.340
"minimizes that function,
because it would minimize",00:29:14.340,00:29:16.800
"the expected search
cost when you want",00:29:16.800,00:29:18.890
"to take this entire
essay, for example,",00:29:18.890,00:29:21.870
"and convert it from English
to French or vice versa.",00:29:21.870,00:29:25.960
"So this can-- if these
are search probabilities,",00:29:25.960,00:29:29.490
"then this would minimize--
this cost function here",00:29:29.490,00:29:33.340
"would minimize
expected search cost.",00:29:33.340,00:29:39.445
Make sense?,00:29:45.530,00:29:46.420
Yeah.,00:29:46.420,00:29:49.070
"So that's the definition
of the problem.",00:29:49.070,00:29:52.560
"And now we have to talk about
why this is complicated,",00:29:52.560,00:29:56.950
"why this requires
dynamic programming.",00:29:56.950,00:30:01.290
"Why can't we just do something
fairly straightforward,",00:30:01.290,00:30:05.630
like a greedy algorithm?,00:30:05.630,00:30:07.504
And so let's look into that.,00:30:07.504,00:30:08.670
"Let me give you a really
good sense for what's",00:30:25.130,00:30:27.300
"going on here with respect
to this cost function",00:30:27.300,00:30:29.840
"and maybe a little
abstract by giving you",00:30:29.840,00:30:33.040
a couple of concrete examples.,00:30:33.040,00:30:36.000
"First off, we got exponentially
many trees, exponential in n.",00:30:36.000,00:30:44.970
Let's say that n equals 2.,00:30:44.970,00:30:47.490
So the number of nodes is 2.,00:30:47.490,00:30:49.490
"Then remember that I'm assuming
that the Ki's are all i's,",00:30:49.490,00:30:55.940
"that 1 and 2 would
be the case for n",00:30:55.940,00:30:59.670
"equals 2 and 1, 2, 3 for
n equals 3, et cetera.",00:30:59.670,00:31:04.040
"So I could have a tree
that looks like that.",00:31:04.040,00:31:06.630
"And I could have a tree
that looks like this.",00:31:06.630,00:31:09.390
That's it.,00:31:09.390,00:31:10.390
"n equals 2, I got 2 trees.",00:31:10.390,00:31:13.160
"So in this case, my cost
function is W1 plus 2W2,",00:31:13.160,00:31:18.455
"and in this case, my cost
function is 2W1 plus W2.",00:31:18.455,00:31:21.870
"Just to be clear, what this
is the K, and it's also the i.",00:31:24.720,00:31:33.310
"So the numbers that
you see inside,",00:31:33.310,00:31:35.360
"those are the i
numbers, which happen",00:31:35.360,00:31:36.920
to be equal to the Ki numbers.,00:31:36.920,00:31:40.030
"And the weight itself
would be the Wi.",00:31:40.030,00:31:42.716
"So I put W1 here, and the reason
it only gets multiplied by 1",00:31:42.716,00:31:46.970
"is because the depth here
is 0, and I add 1 to it.",00:31:46.970,00:31:50.410
"The depth here is 1,
and I add 1 to it, which",00:31:50.410,00:31:53.400
is why I have a 2 out here.,00:31:53.400,00:31:56.490
"Being a little pedantic here
and pointing things out,",00:31:56.490,00:32:01.880
"because you're going to start
seeing some equations that",00:32:01.880,00:32:04.930
"are a little more
complicated than this,",00:32:04.930,00:32:06.630
"and I don't want you
to get confused as",00:32:06.630,00:32:07.940
"to what the weight is and
what the key number is",00:32:07.940,00:32:10.160
and what the depth is.,00:32:10.160,00:32:11.340
"There's three things
going on here.",00:32:11.340,00:32:13.760
"So over here you see that
I'm looking at W1 here,",00:32:13.760,00:32:17.770
which is this key.,00:32:17.770,00:32:19.300
So the 1 corresponds to the 1.,00:32:19.300,00:32:21.510
"And this has a depth of 1, so
I put a 2 in here, and so on.",00:32:21.510,00:32:26.080
"So so far, so good?",00:32:26.080,00:32:28.940
"When you get to n equals 3,
you start getting-- well,",00:32:28.940,00:32:33.670
"at this point, you have 1, 2,
3, 4, 5-- you have five trees.",00:32:33.670,00:32:39.550
And the trees look like this.,00:32:39.550,00:32:42.300
"I'll draw them
really quickly just",00:32:49.030,00:32:50.850
"to get a sense of
the variety here.",00:32:50.850,00:32:53.460
"But I won't write the
equations down for all of them.",00:32:53.460,00:32:56.950
There you go.,00:33:02.899,00:33:03.440
"So those are the five binary
trees associated with n",00:33:03.440,00:33:07.310
"equals 3, the
binary search trees.",00:33:07.310,00:33:10.270
And this is kind of cool.,00:33:10.270,00:33:13.220
It's nice and balanced.,00:33:13.220,00:33:14.680
The other ones aren't.,00:33:14.680,00:33:17.250
And I'm not looking at--,00:33:17.250,00:33:22.450
Should I have another one here?,00:33:22.450,00:33:24.034
I guess I should have.,00:33:24.034,00:33:24.950
"This is a-- oh, no, no, no.",00:33:29.880,00:33:31.530
So I'm not doing mirrors.,00:33:31.530,00:33:33.370
"So there are a
bunch of other trees",00:33:33.370,00:33:35.910
"that have the same equation
associated with two-- no,",00:33:35.910,00:33:39.850
that's not true.,00:33:39.850,00:33:40.760
Because these are it.,00:33:40.760,00:33:42.400
"I was going to say that
you could put 3 in here,",00:33:42.400,00:33:44.400
"but that wouldn't be
a binary search tree.",00:33:44.400,00:33:46.680
So this is it.,00:33:46.680,00:33:48.510
And we've got a bunch of trees.,00:33:48.510,00:33:50.350
"This one would be 2W1 plus W2
plus 2W3 by the same process",00:33:50.350,00:34:00.050
"that I used to show you
that W1 plus 2W2 for the n",00:34:00.050,00:34:04.710
equals 2 case.,00:34:04.710,00:34:05.900
"You just go off, and
that's the equation.",00:34:05.900,00:34:07.810
"And so your goal here in
an algorithm-- clearly",00:34:07.810,00:34:10.179
"this is not the
algorithm you want",00:34:10.179,00:34:11.830
"to enumerate all the
exponentially many trees,",00:34:11.830,00:34:14.739
"compute the equations
for each of those trees,",00:34:14.739,00:34:16.940
and pick the minimum.,00:34:16.940,00:34:18.250
"I mean, that would work, but
it would take exponential time.",00:34:18.250,00:34:22.690
"But that's what
you have to do now.",00:34:22.690,00:34:24.380
That's the goal.,00:34:24.380,00:34:25.920
"You absolutely want the best
possible three that has,",00:34:25.920,00:34:30.350
"for the given Wi's
that you're going",00:34:30.350,00:34:32.230
"to be assigned as
constants, you do",00:34:32.230,00:34:35.340
"want to find the one tree
that has the minimum sum,",00:34:35.340,00:34:40.719
"and you want to do
that for arbitrary n,",00:34:40.719,00:34:42.760
"and you want to do that
in polynomial time.",00:34:42.760,00:34:46.830
"So the first thing that you
do when you have something",00:34:46.830,00:34:53.370
"like this is forgetting
about the fact",00:34:53.370,00:34:58.590
"that we're in a
dynamic programming",00:34:58.590,00:35:00.340
"lecture or a dynamic programming
module of this class,",00:35:00.340,00:35:04.910
"when you see a problem like
this in the real world,",00:35:04.910,00:35:07.970
"you want to think about whether
a greedy algorithm would work",00:35:07.970,00:35:11.320
or not.,00:35:11.320,00:35:12.860
"And you don't want to go off
and build this dynamic program",00:35:12.860,00:35:17.100
"solution, which is,
chances are, going",00:35:17.100,00:35:20.140
"to be more inefficient then
a greedy solution, which,",00:35:20.140,00:35:25.550
"if it produces the optimum
answer, is the best way to go.",00:35:25.550,00:35:30.660
"So an obvious greedy
solution would",00:35:30.660,00:35:35.360
"be to pick K of r in
some greedy fashion.",00:35:35.360,00:35:41.220
"And what is the obvious
way of picking K of r",00:35:45.000,00:35:48.180
"to try and get a
greedy solution that",00:35:48.180,00:35:51.200
"at least attempts to
minimize that cost function",00:35:51.200,00:35:53.510
that we have there?,00:35:53.510,00:35:54.675
AUDIENCE: Highest weight.,00:35:54.675,00:35:55.805
"PROFESSOR: Highest
weight, right?",00:35:55.805,00:35:57.180
"So just pick K of r
to be highest weight.",00:35:57.180,00:35:59.430
"Because that goes back to what
I said about if Wi is high,",00:35:59.430,00:36:04.260
"you want this value
here to be small.",00:36:04.260,00:36:08.170
"So that's essentially
your greedy heuristic.",00:36:08.170,00:36:10.670
"So K of r should be picked
in a greedy fashion.",00:36:10.670,00:36:13.390
"So what you do is
you pick K of r",00:36:13.390,00:36:14.930
"as the root in this
particular problem.",00:36:14.930,00:36:17.410
"And you could certainly
apply this greedy technique",00:36:17.410,00:36:20.190
recursively.,00:36:20.190,00:36:22.230
"So you do that for
every subproblem",00:36:22.230,00:36:24.720
"that you find
because when you do",00:36:24.720,00:36:26.220
"this choice of the root for
Kr in the current problem",00:36:26.220,00:36:30.860
"that you have, you immediately
split the keys into two",00:36:30.860,00:36:35.310
"sets, the sets that have to
go on the left-hand side of Kr",00:36:35.310,00:36:40.380
"and the sets that have to go
on the right-hand side of Kr.",00:36:40.380,00:36:43.340
"So in this case,
you know that you're",00:36:43.340,00:36:45.360
"going to have a bunch of
keys here that correspond",00:36:45.360,00:36:50.110
"to Ki to K4, and
over here, you're",00:36:50.110,00:36:57.880
"going to have-- oh, Kr
minus 1, I should say,",00:36:57.880,00:37:00.370
"because you already
have Kr out there.",00:37:00.370,00:37:02.500
"And the keys here are going to
be Kr plus 1 to Kj, if overall",00:37:02.500,00:37:10.780
"I'm going to say that eij is the
cost of the optimal BST on Ki,",00:37:10.780,00:37:29.415
"Ki plus 1, all the way to Kj.",00:37:29.415,00:37:37.090
"So I'm kind of already
setting myself up here",00:37:40.160,00:37:43.130
for dynamic programming.,00:37:43.130,00:37:45.102
"But it also makes
sense in the case",00:37:45.102,00:37:46.560
"of a greedy algorithm, where
this greedy heuristic is going",00:37:46.560,00:37:50.250
to be applied recursively.,00:37:50.250,00:37:52.510
"So initially, you're
going to have E(1, n)--",00:37:52.510,00:37:56.550
"so if you want to
compute E(1, n),",00:37:56.550,00:37:59.930
"which is the cost of the optimal
BST on the original problem,",00:37:59.930,00:38:05.830
"all the way from 1 to n,
you're going to look at it,",00:38:05.830,00:38:08.970
"and you're going to say, I
have a bunch of keys here",00:38:08.970,00:38:13.650
"of different weights that
correspond to K1 through Kn.",00:38:13.650,00:38:17.430
"I'm going to pick the
Kr that corresponds",00:38:17.430,00:38:19.860
"to the maximum
weight, and I'm going",00:38:19.860,00:38:21.740
"to use that as the
root node, and I'm",00:38:21.740,00:38:25.160
going to stick that up there.,00:38:25.160,00:38:26.590
"And the reason I did
that is because I believe",00:38:26.590,00:38:30.590
"that this greedy heuristic
is going to work,",00:38:30.590,00:38:33.490
"where this maximum
weight node should have",00:38:33.490,00:38:36.660
the absolute minimum depth.,00:38:36.660,00:38:40.140
So I stick that up there.,00:38:40.140,00:38:41.300
"And then my BST invariant tells
me that Ki through Kr minus 1--",00:38:41.300,00:38:46.620
"remember, these are
sorted, and they",00:38:46.620,00:38:49.490
"go in increasing order,
as I have up here.",00:38:49.490,00:38:53.966
"You're going to have
those on the left,",00:38:53.966,00:38:55.590
"and you're going to
have those on the right.",00:38:55.590,00:38:57.720
"And then you've got to
go solve this problem.",00:38:57.720,00:38:59.790
"And you could certainly
apply the greedy heuristic",00:38:59.790,00:39:02.880
to solve this problem.,00:39:02.880,00:39:04.440
"You could go essentially
find the K that",00:39:04.440,00:39:09.480
has the highest weight.,00:39:09.480,00:39:11.460
"So you look at Wi
through Wr minus 1,",00:39:11.460,00:39:14.850
"and you find the K that
has the highest weight.",00:39:14.850,00:39:18.210
"Actually, you're not
going midway here.",00:39:18.210,00:39:19.940
"It's quite possible
that Kr is K of n.",00:39:19.940,00:39:25.100
"It just happens to
be Kr is K of n.",00:39:25.100,00:39:27.320
"So that means that you have the
highest weight node up here,",00:39:27.320,00:39:32.380
but it's also the biggest key.,00:39:32.380,00:39:35.410
"So all of the nodes are
going to be on the left.",00:39:35.410,00:39:37.960
"So this greedy heuristic-- and
now you're starting to see,",00:39:37.960,00:39:40.760
maybe there's a problem here.,00:39:40.760,00:39:42.450
"Because if you have a situation
where the highest weight",00:39:42.450,00:39:48.560
"node is also the
largest node, you're",00:39:48.560,00:39:51.720
"going to get a pretty
unbalanced tree.",00:39:51.720,00:39:55.790
"So I can tell you that
greedy doesn't work.",00:39:55.790,00:39:59.180
"And when I gave this
lecture, I think",00:39:59.180,00:40:02.410
"it was a couple of years
ago, I made that statement,",00:40:02.410,00:40:05.150
"and this annoying student
asked me for an example.",00:40:05.150,00:40:11.440
And I couldn't come up with one.,00:40:11.440,00:40:13.950
"And so I kind of bailed
on it, went on, completely",00:40:13.950,00:40:18.170
"dissatisfied, of course.",00:40:18.170,00:40:19.870
"And by the end of the
lecture, the same student",00:40:19.870,00:40:23.310
came up with a counter-example.,00:40:23.310,00:40:25.370
"So I'm going to have
put that up here",00:40:25.370,00:40:28.040
"and thank the student who
sent me an email about it.",00:40:28.040,00:40:37.150
"And so here's a
concrete example.",00:40:37.150,00:40:40.060
"It turns out I was trying
to get a tree node example",00:40:40.060,00:40:43.240
for a few minutes and failed.,00:40:43.240,00:40:46.470
"It's, I think,
impossible-- I haven't",00:40:46.470,00:40:49.610
"proved this-- to
find a tree node",00:40:49.610,00:40:52.650
"example with arbitrary weights
for which the greedy algorithm",00:40:52.650,00:40:56.720
fails.,00:40:56.720,00:40:58.380
"But four nodes, it fails.",00:40:58.380,00:41:00.860
So that's the good news.,00:41:00.860,00:41:02.770
"So here's the example,
thanks to Nick Davis.",00:41:02.770,00:41:07.635
And it looks like this.,00:41:13.900,00:41:15.090
"So I claim that the
greedy algorithm",00:41:45.000,00:41:47.620
"for the problem that is given
to me would produce this BST.",00:41:47.620,00:41:56.250
"And the reason for
that is simple.",00:41:56.250,00:41:59.790
"The highest weight
node happens to be node",00:41:59.790,00:42:02.270
"2, which has a weight of 10.",00:42:02.270,00:42:04.320
"So I would pick that, and
I would stick that up here,",00:42:04.320,00:42:07.567
"which means, of
course, that I'm going",00:42:07.567,00:42:09.150
"to have to have 1 on
this side, and I'm",00:42:09.150,00:42:11.360
"going to have to have 4
and 3 on the other side.",00:42:11.360,00:42:14.400
"And since 4 has a higher weight
than 3, I'd pick that first.",00:42:14.400,00:42:19.740
"And then 3 would
have to go over here.",00:42:19.740,00:42:22.480
"So if I go do the math, the
cost is going to be 1 times 2--",00:42:22.480,00:42:28.510
"and I'll explain what
these numbers are.",00:42:28.510,00:42:30.420
"I did tell you it was going
to get a little cluttered here",00:42:30.420,00:42:35.360
with lots of numbers.,00:42:35.360,00:42:37.350
"But if you keep that
equation in mind,",00:42:37.350,00:42:39.610
then this should all work out.,00:42:39.610,00:42:42.200
So what do I have here?,00:42:42.200,00:42:44.190
I'm just computing-- this is W1.,00:42:44.190,00:42:48.960
"So you see the first numbers in
each of these are the weights.",00:42:48.960,00:42:52.800
"And so this would
be W2 and et cetera.",00:42:52.800,00:42:55.230
"And you can see that
this is at depth 1, which",00:42:55.230,00:42:58.694
"means I have to have
2 here, because I'm",00:42:58.694,00:43:00.360
adding 1 to the depth.,00:43:00.360,00:43:01.790
"So I have 1 times 2, 10
times 1, because that's",00:43:01.790,00:43:04.720
"at the root, 9
times 2, et cetera.",00:43:04.720,00:43:07.580
And I get 54.,00:43:07.580,00:43:10.020
"It turns out the
optimum tree-- you",00:43:10.020,00:43:12.180
"can do better than that if you
pick 3, and you go like this.",00:43:12.180,00:43:20.210
"And so what you have here
is the cost equals 1 times",00:43:28.670,00:43:32.700
"3 plus 10 times 2 plus 8 times
1 plus 9 times 2, and that's 49.",00:43:32.700,00:43:41.215
So I'll let you look at that.,00:43:45.290,00:43:47.410
"The bottom line is
because of the way",00:43:47.410,00:43:51.100
"the weights are set
up here, you really",00:43:51.100,00:43:54.310
"want to use the top
three spots, which",00:43:54.310,00:43:59.530
"have that the minimum depth,
for the highest weight nodes.",00:43:59.530,00:44:04.080
"And so you can see that I could
make these weights arbitrary,",00:44:04.080,00:44:09.980
"obviously, and I could
break a greedy algorithm",00:44:09.980,00:44:12.890
as this little example shows.,00:44:12.890,00:44:14.930
So we got no recurs here.,00:44:14.930,00:44:17.060
We got to do some more work.,00:44:17.060,00:44:18.560
"We're going to have to use
DP to solve this problem.",00:44:18.560,00:44:21.177
"The good news is DP
does solve this problem.",00:44:21.177,00:44:23.010
"So let's take a look
at the decomposition.",00:44:26.490,00:44:29.340
"And as with anything
else, the key",00:44:29.340,00:44:32.060
"is the step that
corresponds to breaking up",00:44:32.060,00:44:38.090
"the original problem
into two parts or more",00:44:38.090,00:44:43.860
"that essentially give you
this sort of decomposition.",00:44:43.860,00:44:46.620
And we don't quite know.,00:44:46.620,00:44:48.200
"So this is really the
key question here.",00:44:48.200,00:44:50.440
"We don't quite know what the
root node is going to be.",00:44:50.440,00:44:53.640
"So what do we do when we
don't know what to do?",00:44:53.640,00:44:59.310
"What do we do in DP when
we don't know what to do?",00:44:59.310,00:45:03.210
"This is a very
profound question.",00:45:03.210,00:45:06.035
What do you do?,00:45:06.035,00:45:06.660
AUDIENCE: Guess.,00:45:06.660,00:45:07.326
PROFESSOR: You guess.,00:45:07.326,00:45:08.510
"And not only do yo guess,
you guess all outcomes.",00:45:08.510,00:45:12.940
"You say, is it going
to come up heads?",00:45:12.940,00:45:14.720
Is it going to come up tails?,00:45:14.720,00:45:15.928
I'll guess both.,00:45:15.928,00:45:17.810
You have a die.,00:45:17.810,00:45:18.520
"It's going to get rolled,
a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.",00:45:18.520,00:45:22.220
"Guess them all, right?",00:45:22.220,00:45:23.930
"So if you're going to have to
guess that the root node could",00:45:23.930,00:45:26.940
"be any of the keys,
and it still--",00:45:26.940,00:45:31.980
"I mean there's a linear
number of guesses there.",00:45:31.980,00:45:34.090
That's the good news.,00:45:34.090,00:45:35.190
"It's going to stay
polynomial time.",00:45:35.190,00:45:36.997
So we're going to have to guess.,00:45:36.997,00:45:38.330
"And once you do that
guess, it turns out",00:45:38.330,00:45:40.720
"that decomposition
that you see up there",00:45:40.720,00:45:43.320
is exactly what we want.,00:45:43.320,00:45:45.400
"It's just that the
greedy algorithm",00:45:45.400,00:45:46.870
"didn't bother with all of
these different guesses.",00:45:46.870,00:45:50.210
"And the DP is different
from the greedy algorithm",00:45:50.210,00:45:52.910
"because it's going to do
each of those guesses,",00:45:52.910,00:45:55.910
"and it's going to pick the
best one that comes out",00:45:55.910,00:45:58.090
of all of those guesses.,00:45:58.090,00:45:59.480
"So it's really not that
different from greedy.",00:45:59.480,00:46:02.500
"So we'll keep that up
there, leave that here.",00:46:02.500,00:46:06.380
Let's go over here.,00:46:06.380,00:46:07.990
"So the recursion
here is not going",00:46:07.990,00:46:09.590
"to be that hard, once you have
gotten the insight that you",00:46:09.590,00:46:16.330
"just have to go make a linear
number of guesses corresponding",00:46:16.330,00:46:19.900
"to the root node for your
particular subproblem,",00:46:19.900,00:46:22.171
"and obviously this
happens recursively.",00:46:22.171,00:46:23.795
"So there's a little
something here",00:46:26.870,00:46:29.230
"that that I'll point
out with respect",00:46:29.230,00:46:30.985
to writing these equations out.,00:46:30.985,00:46:33.590
"So what I have here,
just to be clear,",00:46:33.590,00:46:36.270
is what I wrote up there.,00:46:36.270,00:46:37.900
"Even when I was talking
about the greedy algorithm,",00:46:37.900,00:46:40.120
I had the subproblems defined.,00:46:40.120,00:46:43.190
"So the original problem
is E1 through n.",00:46:43.190,00:46:46.280
"The subproblems
correspond to eij.",00:46:46.280,00:46:51.170
"And given a subproblem,
once I make a root choice,",00:46:51.170,00:46:55.290
"I get two subproblems that
result from the root choice.",00:46:55.290,00:46:59.660
"And each of those
two subproblems",00:46:59.660,00:47:02.060
"is going to be
something-- and this",00:47:02.060,00:47:05.040
"is something to keep in mind as
we write these equations out--",00:47:05.040,00:47:07.800
"they're going to be one
level below the root.",00:47:07.800,00:47:11.380
"So keep in mind that the
original eij subproblem",00:47:11.380,00:47:15.320
"corresponded to this
level, but that Ei",00:47:15.320,00:47:19.560
"r minus 1 problem and
the E r plus 1j problem",00:47:19.560,00:47:28.940
are at one level below.,00:47:28.940,00:47:33.640
"So keep that in mind as we
write these equations up.",00:47:33.640,00:47:37.730
"And so what I want to do here
is just write the recurrence.",00:47:37.730,00:47:42.000
"And after that, things
become fairly mechanical.",00:47:42.000,00:47:44.410
The fun is in the recurrence.,00:47:44.410,00:47:46.710
So I got Wi if i equals j.,00:47:46.710,00:47:52.990
And so I'm at this level.,00:47:52.990,00:47:54.590
"And if I just have one node
left, then at that level,",00:47:54.590,00:48:00.330
"I'm going to pay the weight
associated with that node,",00:48:00.330,00:48:04.440
"and I'm going to have
to do a certain amount",00:48:04.440,00:48:07.720
"of multiplication here
with respect to the depth.",00:48:07.720,00:48:12.940
"But I'm just talking about
eij as the subproblem weight,",00:48:12.940,00:48:17.790
"just focusing in
on that problem.",00:48:17.790,00:48:19.580
"So if I only have one
node, it's the root node.",00:48:19.580,00:48:22.380
"And that weight
is going to be Wi,",00:48:22.380,00:48:24.740
"because the root
node has depth of 0,",00:48:24.740,00:48:27.110
and I'm going to add 1 to it.,00:48:27.110,00:48:29.100
"So for that
subproblem, I got Wi.",00:48:29.100,00:48:32.427
"Keep that in mind, because
that's the only subtlety here",00:48:32.427,00:48:34.760
"with respect to these
equations, making sure",00:48:34.760,00:48:37.620
"that our actual cost
function that we're computing",00:48:37.620,00:48:40.950
"has the correct
depth multiplicands",00:48:40.950,00:48:45.100
associated with it.,00:48:45.100,00:48:47.500
"So then we have our
linear guessing.",00:48:47.500,00:48:51.410
"And I might have said
max at some point.",00:48:51.410,00:48:55.110
We want to get the min here.,00:48:55.110,00:48:57.240
"And I had minimize
here, so I think",00:48:57.240,00:48:59.610
"I wrote things down
correct, but at some point,",00:48:59.610,00:49:01.660
"I think I might have said
we want to maximize cost.",00:49:01.660,00:49:04.610
"But we do want to minimize
cost here corresponding",00:49:04.610,00:49:07.340
to the expected search.,00:49:07.340,00:49:10.420
"So we're doing a linear,
and we're doing a min.",00:49:10.420,00:49:14.790
"And we're going
to go off and look",00:49:14.790,00:49:16.900
"at each of the different
nodes as being the root,",00:49:16.900,00:49:21.460
just like we discussed.,00:49:21.460,00:49:24.030
"And what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to simply say, first,",00:49:24.030,00:49:29.420
"that I'm going to
look at Ei r minus 1,",00:49:29.420,00:49:33.440
"which corresponds to this, and
I'm going to have plus E of r",00:49:33.440,00:49:42.270
"plus 1, j.",00:49:42.270,00:49:46.520
"And at this point,
I don't quite have",00:49:46.520,00:49:54.300
"what I want because
I haven't actually",00:49:54.300,00:49:57.980
"taken into account the fact that
the depth of the Ei r minus 1",00:49:57.980,00:50:05.230
"and the r plus 1j is
1 more than the eij.",00:50:05.230,00:50:11.090
So it's 1 more than that.,00:50:11.090,00:50:13.190
"And I also haven't taken
into account the fact",00:50:13.190,00:50:15.110
"that, in this case, I definitely
need to add a Wi as well.",00:50:15.110,00:50:21.740
"Because the root node is part
of my solution in both cases.",00:50:21.740,00:50:26.340
"In one case, it ended my
solution, the top case.",00:50:26.340,00:50:30.021
"But in this case, it's
also the root node,",00:50:30.021,00:50:31.770
"as you can see over
on the left, and I've",00:50:31.770,00:50:33.478
got to add that in there.,00:50:33.478,00:50:34.720
"So I definitely need
to add a Wi here.",00:50:34.720,00:50:38.680
And what else do I need to add?,00:50:38.680,00:50:40.290
"From a standpoint
of the weights,",00:50:44.510,00:50:46.580
"what other weights do I
need to add to this line?",00:50:46.580,00:50:53.443
Yeah?,00:50:53.443,00:50:54.350
Go ahead.,00:50:54.350,00:50:55.213
"AUDIENCE: First of all,
shouldn't that be a Wr?",00:50:55.213,00:50:57.855
"PROFESSOR: First of
all, that should be",00:50:57.855,00:50:59.480
"a Wr, you're exactly correct.",00:50:59.480,00:51:01.165
"AUDIENCE: And you want
to add all the weights.",00:51:01.165,00:51:03.590
"PROFESSOR: And you want to
add all the weights, right.",00:51:03.590,00:51:06.560
You're exactly right.,00:51:06.560,00:51:09.081
"I have two more
Frisbees, but I need",00:51:09.081,00:51:10.580
to use them for something else.,00:51:10.580,00:51:12.750
So you get one next time.,00:51:12.750,00:51:15.110
Or do I have more than that?,00:51:15.110,00:51:18.910
"No, no.",00:51:18.910,00:51:19.600
"These are precious
Frisbees here.",00:51:19.600,00:51:21.650
"Sorry, man.",00:51:21.650,00:51:22.200
"And you corrected me, too.",00:51:25.250,00:51:27.280
Shoot.,00:51:27.280,00:51:27.900
This is sad.,00:51:27.900,00:51:30.990
So that needed to be a Wr.,00:51:30.990,00:51:33.680
"But you also need to add up all
of the nodes that are in here,",00:51:33.680,00:51:37.920
because they're one more level.,00:51:37.920,00:51:40.630
"And now you see why
I made the mistake.",00:51:40.630,00:51:43.950
I don't usually make mistakes.,00:51:43.950,00:51:46.470
"But what I really
want-- actually it's",00:51:46.470,00:51:49.610
"more like-- I don't
know, a few per lecture.",00:51:49.610,00:51:52.610
Constant order one mistakes.,00:51:52.610,00:51:54.035
"I'm going to say this is
Wi, j, where Wi, j is simply",00:51:56.700,00:52:02.560
"the sum of all of the
weights from i to j.",00:52:02.560,00:52:04.703
"And this makes perfect
sense, because the nice thing",00:52:17.690,00:52:20.580
"is that I don't even need
to put an r in there.",00:52:20.580,00:52:22.610
I could choose a particular r.,00:52:25.220,00:52:27.686
Wr will be in there.,00:52:27.686,00:52:29.300
"But all of the other nodes are
going to be in there anyway.",00:52:29.300,00:52:31.920
"So it doesn't really
matter what the r selection",00:52:31.920,00:52:34.980
"is corresponding
to this term here.",00:52:34.980,00:52:37.310
"I will put it inside
the minimization.",00:52:37.310,00:52:41.510
"This bracket here
is closed with that,",00:52:41.510,00:52:43.500
"but you can pull that
out, because that",00:52:43.500,00:52:45.140
doesn't depend on r.,00:52:45.140,00:52:46.650
"It's just going to be there
for all of the cases, all",00:52:46.650,00:52:50.360
of the guesses.,00:52:50.360,00:52:52.220
So that's it.,00:52:52.220,00:52:53.811
"That's our recurrence
relationship corresponding",00:52:53.811,00:52:57.020
"to the DP for this
particular problem.",00:52:57.020,00:53:02.840
"You can go figure out
what the complexity is.",00:53:02.840,00:53:05.960
"I have other things to
do, so we'll move on.",00:53:05.960,00:53:09.260
"But you can do the
same things, and these",00:53:09.260,00:53:11.220
"are fairly mechanical at this
point to go write code for it,",00:53:11.220,00:53:14.850
"trace the solution to get
the optimum binary search",00:53:14.850,00:53:17.290
"tree, yadda, yadda, yadda.",00:53:17.290,00:53:21.170
"Any questions about this
equation or anything else?",00:53:21.170,00:53:23.980
Do people get that?,00:53:23.980,00:53:25.172
"Yeah, go ahead.",00:53:25.172,00:53:25.980
"AUDIENCE: What is
the depth input?",00:53:25.980,00:53:28.300
"PROFESSOR: So the depth is
getting added by the weights.",00:53:28.300,00:53:32.290
"So basically what's happening
is that as I go deeper",00:53:32.290,00:53:35.630
"into the recursion, I'm adding
the weights and potentially",00:53:35.630,00:53:39.520
"multiple times,
depending on the depth.",00:53:39.520,00:53:42.750
"So if you really think
about it, this Wij,",00:53:42.750,00:53:46.062
I added all of these weights.,00:53:46.062,00:53:48.300
"But when you go
into this recursion,",00:53:48.300,00:53:50.520
"into the ei of r
minus 1, well, you're",00:53:50.520,00:53:53.120
"going to see i to r minus 1 in
the next level of recursion.",00:53:53.120,00:53:57.330
"So you would have
added the weight again.",00:53:57.330,00:54:00.190
"So it's not the case
that the weights are only",00:54:00.190,00:54:02.810
appearing once.,00:54:02.810,00:54:04.130
"They're, in fact,
appearing this many times.",00:54:04.130,00:54:07.070
"So that's what kind of
cute about this, the way",00:54:07.070,00:54:09.580
we wrote it.,00:54:09.580,00:54:10.310
Any other questions?,00:54:13.237,00:54:14.070
"All right, good.",00:54:16.610,00:54:17.610
So we're done with that.,00:54:17.610,00:54:19.640
So one last example.,00:54:19.640,00:54:21.740
"This is, again, a little bit
different from the examples",00:54:21.740,00:54:26.040
"of DP we've looked at up until
now, because it's a game.",00:54:26.040,00:54:30.670
"And you have an
opponent, and you",00:54:30.670,00:54:33.926
"have to figure out
what the opponent is",00:54:33.926,00:54:35.550
going to do and try to win.,00:54:35.550,00:54:41.170
"I suppose you could
try to lose as well.",00:54:41.170,00:54:43.030
"But let's assume here, same
thing with minimization",00:54:43.030,00:54:46.700
"and maximization,
most of the time",00:54:46.700,00:54:49.300
"you can invert these
cost functions,",00:54:49.300,00:54:51.600
and DP will still work.,00:54:51.600,00:54:53.750
"But let's assume here that
you want to win this game.",00:54:53.750,00:54:57.620
"So the game is an
alternating coins game",00:54:57.620,00:55:00.280
"where we have a row of n
coins of values V1 through Vn.",00:55:00.280,00:55:13.040
"These are not necessarily
in any particular order.",00:55:13.040,00:55:16.620
And n is even.,00:55:16.620,00:55:18.630
"And the goal here is
select the outer coins.",00:55:18.630,00:55:26.280
"So select either the first
our last coin from the row,",00:55:26.280,00:55:39.900
and then the opponent plays.,00:55:39.900,00:55:43.570
"Remove permanently, but
add it to your value",00:55:43.570,00:55:52.250
and receive the value.,00:55:52.250,00:55:53.240
"So I need two volunteers
to play this game.",00:55:57.980,00:56:03.170
"And you want to
maximize the value.",00:56:03.170,00:56:06.290
The winner gets a blue Frisbee.,00:56:06.290,00:56:09.220
"The loser gets a purple
Frisbee, because blue",00:56:09.220,00:56:12.000
is greater than purple.,00:56:12.000,00:56:14.020
"And you might ask, why is that.",00:56:14.020,00:56:16.540
"Well, if you went to a beach,
and you saw water this color,",00:56:16.540,00:56:21.220
"and you went to another beach,
and you saw water this color,",00:56:21.220,00:56:24.610
which beach would you pick?,00:56:24.610,00:56:26.490
Right?,00:56:26.490,00:56:26.990
This is Cozumel.,00:56:26.990,00:56:28.030
This is Boston Harbor.,00:56:28.030,00:56:30.790
So blue is greater than purple.,00:56:30.790,00:56:32.930
"Don't use this proof
technique in the quiz.",00:56:32.930,00:56:36.160
"So do I have a couple of
volunteers to play this game?",00:56:36.160,00:56:40.380
Two of them over there.,00:56:40.380,00:56:41.470
Are you waving for him?,00:56:41.470,00:56:43.780
Yeah.,00:56:43.780,00:56:44.280
I see one.,00:56:44.280,00:56:44.440
You can come down.,00:56:44.440,00:56:45.370
Another volunteer?,00:56:45.370,00:56:46.120
Yeah.,00:56:48.711,00:56:49.210
Over there.,00:56:49.210,00:56:51.830
You don't get your Frisbees yet.,00:56:51.830,00:56:53.440
"So we're going to
make this really fair.",00:56:53.440,00:56:56.538
What's your name?,00:56:56.538,00:56:57.246

"Josiah and Tessa, I'm going
to write out a bunch of-- it's",00:56:59.970,00:57:06.370
going to be a fairly short game.,00:57:06.370,00:57:09.750
"And we're going
to be really fair,",00:57:12.490,00:57:14.050

to decide whether Josiah goes",00:57:14.050,00:57:17.940
"first-- you can pick
heads or tails--",00:57:17.940,00:57:21.550
or whether Tessa goes first.,00:57:21.550,00:57:24.460
"Actually if you win, you can
let her go first if you want.",00:57:24.460,00:57:28.870
But you get to choose.,00:57:28.870,00:57:29.810
AUDIENCE: All right.,00:57:29.810,00:57:31.020
PROFESSOR: So pick.,00:57:31.020,00:57:32.020
AUDIENCE: Heads.,00:57:32.020,00:57:33.036
PROFESSOR: That's heads.,00:57:33.036,00:57:34.190
"Do you want to go first, or do
you want to let Tessa go first?",00:57:34.190,00:57:38.995

"So Tessa, you get to go first.",00:57:48.220,00:57:50.320
"AUDIENCE: OK, 6.",00:57:50.320,00:57:52.560
"PROFESSOR: 6, OK.",00:57:52.560,00:57:54.240
"So let's just say T.
So you get to choose",00:57:54.240,00:58:00.270
"either 25 or 4, Josiah.",00:58:00.270,00:58:02.800
AUDIENCE: I think I'd pick 25.,00:58:02.800,00:58:04.290
"PROFESSOR: You think
you'll take 25.",00:58:04.290,00:58:06.550
So that's j.,00:58:06.550,00:58:07.850
"So it's not on the 4 and 19 over
here because those are gone.",00:58:07.850,00:58:11.960
So your turn again.,00:58:11.960,00:58:13.390
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:58:13.390,00:58:15.602
"Can I take a minute,
or should I just go?",00:58:15.602,00:58:18.190

can take 30 seconds.",00:58:18.190,00:58:21.405

"PROFESSOR: 19, OK.",00:58:24.533,00:58:25.680
AUDIENCE: 4.,00:58:38.576,00:58:39.568

"AUDIENCE: All right, 4.",00:58:41.056,00:58:42.048
PROFESSOR: 4.,00:58:42.048,00:58:44.560
All right.,00:58:44.560,00:58:47.400
And 42?,00:58:47.400,00:58:48.335
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:58:48.335,00:58:48.960
"PROFESSOR: All right, 42.",00:58:48.960,00:58:50.850
This is one strange game.,00:58:50.850,00:58:54.650
"Now, we get to add
up the numbers.",00:58:54.650,00:58:57.130
This is going to be tight.,00:58:57.130,00:59:00.200
4 plus 39 is 43.,00:59:00.200,00:59:03.050
43 plus 25 is 68.,00:59:03.050,00:59:05.053
42 plus 19 is 61.,00:59:07.870,00:59:11.010
61 plus 6 is 67.,00:59:11.010,00:59:14.030
Ooh.,00:59:14.030,00:59:15.970
"Well, you get Frisbees.",00:59:15.970,00:59:19.130
"Well, blue for you.",00:59:19.130,00:59:20.837
"I mean, you could give
her blue if you like.",00:59:20.837,00:59:22.670
AUDIENCE: I prefer purple.,00:59:22.670,00:59:23.250
PROFESSOR: You prefer purple.,00:59:23.250,00:59:24.458
Thanks.,00:59:24.458,00:59:25.670
Good job.,00:59:25.670,00:59:26.706
[APPLAUSE],00:59:26.706,00:59:31.830
"No offense is intended
to Josiah and Tessa,",00:59:31.830,00:59:34.660
"but that was a classic example
of how not to play the game.",00:59:34.660,00:59:39.930
"First off, Josiah could
have won regardless",00:59:39.930,00:59:44.970
"of the coins that were
up there, regardless",00:59:44.970,00:59:47.610
"of the values of the coins,
if he'd chosen to go first.",00:59:47.610,00:59:51.670
"So this game, the
person who goes first",00:59:51.670,00:59:54.710
is guaranteed to not lose.,00:59:54.710,00:59:56.790
"And by that, I mean you
may have a situation where",00:59:56.790,01:00:01.070
"you can have a tie in
terms of the values,",01:00:01.070,01:00:03.430
"but you're guaranteed
to not lose.",01:00:03.430,01:00:06.774
"Now, he ended up winning
anyway, because there",01:00:06.774,01:00:08.690
"were other errors
made during this,",01:00:08.690,01:00:12.710
"and I don't have the time
to enumerate all of them.",01:00:12.710,01:00:15.445
[LAUGHTER],01:00:15.445,01:00:17.380
"So we're just going to go move
on and do the right thing.",01:00:17.380,01:00:21.420
"So let me first tell
you, outside of DP, just",01:00:28.290,01:00:31.560
"in case you play this game
over Spring Break or something,",01:00:31.560,01:00:35.330
"how you can win this
game without having",01:00:35.330,01:00:39.880
"to compute complicated
recursive memoization DP",01:00:39.880,01:00:44.170
programs for this case.,01:00:44.170,01:00:47.350
"So let's say I have V1, V2,
V3, all the way to V n minus 1",01:00:47.350,01:00:53.190
and Vn.,01:00:53.190,01:00:53.690
And remember n is even.,01:00:53.690,01:00:56.270
"So you've got to
pick n over 2 coins",01:00:56.270,01:00:58.830
"if you're the first
player and n over 2",01:00:58.830,01:01:01.004
if you're the second player.,01:01:01.004,01:01:02.170
"So what the first
player does is simply",01:01:05.630,01:01:13.740
"compute V1-- take the odd
numbers-- and n is even,",01:01:13.740,01:01:19.150
"so you've got V n
minus 1 being odd.",01:01:19.150,01:01:22.070
"Compute V1 plus V3 all
the way to V n minus 1,",01:01:22.070,01:01:26.070
"and compare that with
the even positions,",01:01:26.070,01:01:31.730
V2 plus V4 all the way Vn.,01:01:31.730,01:01:34.800
"So in this particular
instance, Josiah,",01:01:34.800,01:01:40.330
"who went second,
if you just look",01:01:40.330,01:01:43.910
"at the odd positions, which
is, in fact, what he ended up",01:01:43.910,01:01:46.800
"picking, it was 4 plus
39 plus 25, which was 68.",01:01:46.800,01:01:52.510
"So you can do this
computation beforehand.",01:01:52.510,01:01:54.450
"You compute this to
be 68, in our case.",01:01:54.450,01:01:56.850
Compare that with 67.,01:01:56.850,01:02:00.890
"And you don't give up your
first-player advantage.",01:02:00.890,01:02:07.057
"So you're going with
the first player.",01:02:07.057,01:02:08.640
"But now you say, I know
that I can set this up--",01:02:08.640,01:02:14.065
"and that wasn't
the order that he",01:02:14.065,01:02:15.440
"did this-- but I know
I can set this up",01:02:15.440,01:02:17.490
"so I always have a chance to
get V1, V3, V5, et cetera.",01:02:17.490,01:02:23.220
"Because let's just say that
the first player Josiah",01:02:23.220,01:02:26.910
started first.,01:02:26.910,01:02:28.130
"And he decided, in this
case, that the odd values",01:02:28.130,01:02:30.700
are the ones that win.,01:02:30.700,01:02:32.980
So let's say he picks V1.,01:02:32.980,01:02:36.630
"At this point, Tessa
sees V2 through Vn.",01:02:36.630,01:02:41.170
So you're just looking at that.,01:02:41.170,01:02:42.980
"Now Tessa could either pick
V2 or she could pick Vn.",01:02:42.980,01:02:47.870
"In that case, Josiah,
who's the first player,",01:02:47.870,01:02:50.890
"could pick V3 or Vn minus
1 and stick with his rule",01:02:50.890,01:02:54.275
of picking the odd coins.,01:02:54.275,01:02:56.910
"So regardless of
what Tessa does,",01:02:56.910,01:02:59.990
"the first player,
Josiah, could pick odd",01:02:59.990,01:03:04.320
"if odd was the way to go or if
the values were such that, even",01:03:04.320,01:03:07.540
"with the way to go,
he could go even.",01:03:07.540,01:03:10.700
"So no reason for the
first player to lose.",01:03:10.700,01:03:14.160
"But let's just say that you're
a nasty person, Michael Jordan",01:03:14.160,01:03:22.170
nasty.,01:03:22.170,01:03:24.190
"You want to just
press your opponent.",01:03:24.190,01:03:27.890
"You want to make sure they
never want to play you again.",01:03:27.890,01:03:31.780
"So now you have a
maximization problem.",01:03:31.780,01:03:36.560
So this is clearly not DP.,01:03:36.560,01:03:37.770
"You don't need DP to add
up a bunch of numbers.",01:03:37.770,01:03:40.390
"But let's say that you want
to, given a set of coins,",01:03:40.390,01:03:44.250
"V1 through Vn, you want
a dynamic strategy that",01:03:44.250,01:03:51.260
gives you the maximum value.,01:03:51.260,01:03:55.730
"This odd versus even
is a bit constraining,",01:03:55.730,01:03:58.960
"because you're stuck
to these positions.",01:03:58.960,01:04:00.900
"And it's good to be
in that situation",01:04:00.900,01:04:03.070
"if you just want to win and
you don't care how you win.",01:04:03.070,01:04:06.040
"But if you want to
maximize, then it's",01:04:06.040,01:04:07.760
a more complicated problem.,01:04:07.760,01:04:10.000
"And so we have to talk about
how you would do something that",01:04:10.000,01:04:13.980
"would give-- maybe it would be
V1 and V4 and something else,",01:04:13.980,01:04:19.000
depends on the values.,01:04:19.000,01:04:20.494
"How would you get
to a situation--",01:04:20.494,01:04:21.910
if you're the first player.,01:04:21.910,01:04:23.010
"We'll just stick with
you're the first player.",01:04:23.010,01:04:24.926
"You know you can't lose
using this strategy.",01:04:24.926,01:04:27.980
"But not only do you
want to not lose,",01:04:27.980,01:04:29.960
"you want to get as many
coins as possible--",01:04:29.960,01:04:32.410
let's say this is money.,01:04:32.410,01:04:33.860
"More money is better,
and that's your goal.",01:04:33.860,01:04:40.470
So people understand that.,01:04:40.470,01:04:42.460
"A little trick there with,
I guess, a greedy algorithm",01:04:42.460,01:04:48.922
you can think of.,01:04:48.922,01:04:49.630
"Or it's not really
even something",01:04:49.630,01:04:53.710
"that you might want
to call an algorithm.",01:04:53.710,01:04:55.770
It's a little computation.,01:04:55.770,01:05:00.440
"And our goal now is to
maximize the amount of money",01:05:00.440,01:05:14.970
when assuming you move first.,01:05:14.970,01:05:21.530
"And so this is going to be a
little bit different from all",01:05:21.530,01:05:24.920
"of the other problems
we've looked at,",01:05:24.920,01:05:26.580
"because we have to now think
about what the opponent would",01:05:26.580,01:05:29.110
do.,01:05:29.110,01:05:30.140
"And there's going to be
a sequence of moves here.",01:05:30.140,01:05:32.550
"You're going to move
first, so that one is easy.",01:05:32.550,01:05:34.860
You've got the whole problem.,01:05:34.860,01:05:36.460
"But now you have to
say, the opponent",01:05:36.460,01:05:38.910
"is going to move
and pick a coin.",01:05:38.910,01:05:41.850
"And then you have to
think of your subproblems",01:05:41.850,01:05:44.600
"as the potential rows of coins
that are going to be different,",01:05:44.600,01:05:49.890
"depending on what
the opponent does.",01:05:49.890,01:05:51.910
"And through this process, you
have to maximize the value.",01:05:51.910,01:05:55.240
"So it's really pretty
different from the other couple",01:05:55.240,01:05:57.940
of examples that we looked at.,01:05:57.940,01:06:01.970
"So we're going to have to
do a little bit of set-up",01:06:01.970,01:06:04.130
"before we get to the point
where we can write something",01:06:04.130,01:06:06.421
"like this, which is
the solution to our DP.",01:06:06.421,01:06:10.800
And so let me do that set-up.,01:06:10.800,01:06:12.290
But it's not super complicated.,01:06:12.290,01:06:14.780
"And part of this is going
to look kind of the same",01:06:14.780,01:06:18.080
"as previous problems
we've looked at.",01:06:18.080,01:06:20.930
"So Vij is the max
value we can definitely",01:06:20.930,01:06:28.750
win if it is our turn.,01:06:28.750,01:06:37.925
"And only coins Vi
through Vj remain.",01:06:40.710,01:06:47.840
And so we have Vii.,01:06:53.440,01:06:56.660
"Then there's only one coin
left, and you just pick i.",01:06:56.660,01:07:01.204
"Now, you might say,
but that's never",01:07:04.040,01:07:07.720
"going to happen if there's
an even number of coins",01:07:07.720,01:07:10.460
"and I'm playing first, because
the other player is going",01:07:10.460,01:07:14.950
"to be at the end of the-- is
going to be the person who",01:07:14.950,01:07:20.100
picks the last coin.,01:07:20.100,01:07:21.190
"But we need to
categorize Vii because we",01:07:21.190,01:07:23.650
"need to model what the
other player is going to do.",01:07:23.650,01:07:27.030
"So we can't just
say that we're going",01:07:27.030,01:07:28.760
"to be looking at an even
number of coins in terms",01:07:28.760,01:07:31.260
"of the row of coins that
you look at, which is true,",01:07:31.260,01:07:34.820
"that when you get
to move, you only",01:07:34.820,01:07:36.910
"see an even number of coins
if you're the first player.",01:07:36.910,01:07:39.230
"But you do have to model
what the opponent does .",01:07:39.230,01:07:41.280
So we need the Vii.,01:07:41.280,01:07:42.071
"And what you might
see, of course,",01:07:44.760,01:07:47.850
"is a board that looks like Vi
i plus 1, for some arbitrary i.",01:07:47.850,01:07:59.960
"So that's why I
have it up there.",01:07:59.960,01:08:01.490
"But remember that you're only
picking coins on the outside,",01:08:01.490,01:08:04.847
"so it's not like you're
going to have a gap.",01:08:04.847,01:08:06.680
"I mean, you're not going to
have V3 left and V7 left.",01:08:06.680,01:08:10.087
"There's no way that's
going to happen.",01:08:10.087,01:08:11.670
"You're just going to keep
shrinking, taking things",01:08:11.670,01:08:13.753
from the left or the right.,01:08:13.753,01:08:15.180
"So it's going to
be i and i plus 1.",01:08:15.180,01:08:17.310
That make sense?,01:08:17.310,01:08:19.060
"And so in this case,
what would you pick?",01:08:19.060,01:08:21.310
Vi and i plus 1.,01:08:21.310,01:08:23.970
You just pick the max.,01:08:23.970,01:08:25.240
"Because at the end of this,
either you did it right",01:08:25.240,01:08:28.920
or you did it wrong.,01:08:28.920,01:08:30.170
"Either way, you're going
to improve your situation",01:08:30.170,01:08:32.930
"by picking the max
of Vi or Vi i plus 1.",01:08:32.930,01:08:36.220
"So there's no two
things about it.",01:08:36.220,01:08:38.220
"So here, you're going to
pick the maximum of the two.",01:08:38.220,01:08:48.200
"And you might have Vi i plus 2,
which is an odd number of coins",01:08:51.554,01:09:00.430
that your opponent might see.,01:09:00.430,01:09:02.609
"It gets more complicated
for Vi and i plus 2.",01:09:02.609,01:09:06.420
"We're going to have to now start
thinking in more general terms",01:09:06.420,01:09:10.680
"as to what the
different moves are.",01:09:10.680,01:09:12.474
"But we've got the
base cases here.",01:09:12.474,01:09:13.890
"All I did here was take
care of the base case",01:09:13.890,01:09:16.880
"or a couple of base
cases associated",01:09:16.880,01:09:18.810
"with a single coin, which
is what your opponent will",01:09:18.810,01:09:21.899
"see and pick, or two coins,
which is your last move.",01:09:21.899,01:09:26.460
"So with DP, of
course, you always",01:09:26.460,01:09:28.270
"have to go down
to your base case,",01:09:28.270,01:09:31.010
"and that's when
things become easy.",01:09:31.010,01:09:34.130
"So we have to talk
about two things",01:09:34.130,01:09:37.050
"and put up our
recurrence together.",01:09:37.050,01:09:41.510
"The two things we
have to talk about",01:09:41.510,01:09:43.390
"are what you do when you
move, and that's actually",01:09:43.390,01:09:48.229
"fairly easy, and
the second thing",01:09:48.229,01:09:50.890
"is what the model
of the opponent",01:09:50.890,01:09:53.580
"looks like when you're waiting
for him or her to move.",01:09:53.580,01:09:59.270
"So let's take a
look at your move.",01:09:59.270,01:10:03.515
And I've got V1.,01:10:03.515,01:10:05.970
Let's look at Vi.,01:10:05.970,01:10:07.074
"Vj here, dot dot dot, Vn.",01:10:11.030,01:10:14.480
So that's what you see.,01:10:14.480,01:10:17.330
And you're looking at i and j.,01:10:17.330,01:10:20.780
"And at this point, you're
seeing all those other coins,",01:10:20.780,01:10:24.020
"the outer coins have disappeared
into people's pockets.",01:10:24.020,01:10:28.840
"And you're looking
at this interval.",01:10:28.840,01:10:33.400
"So I'm going to write
out what Vij should be.",01:10:33.400,01:10:36.730
"And keep in mind that we want
to maximize the amount of money.",01:10:36.730,01:10:41.590
"And we want to say
that you should",01:10:41.590,01:10:43.150
"be able to definitely win this
amount of money, regardless",01:10:43.150,01:10:47.510
of what the opponent does.,01:10:47.510,01:10:50.000
"So I want to do
a max, obviously.",01:10:50.000,01:10:55.570
And I have two choices here.,01:10:55.570,01:10:58.850
I can pick Vi or I can pick Vj.,01:10:58.850,01:11:01.550
"It's not like there's
a lot of choices here.",01:11:01.550,01:11:03.810
"So if I pick Vi,
then-- let me go ahead",01:11:03.810,01:11:08.090
and say I pick Vi here.,01:11:08.090,01:11:10.590
"And here, I pick Vj.",01:11:10.590,01:11:13.025
"Let me draw this out
a little bit better.",01:11:18.120,01:11:21.810
"So I've got to fill in these
two arguments to my max.",01:11:21.810,01:11:28.320
So this is easy.,01:11:28.320,01:11:32.010
"I'm going to have
a plus Vi here.",01:11:32.010,01:11:34.360
"Going to have a plus
Vj here because I",01:11:34.360,01:11:37.930
picked the appropriate value.,01:11:37.930,01:11:40.370
"And now, this is also
not that difficult.",01:11:40.370,01:11:45.230
What exactly happens?,01:11:45.230,01:11:46.270
"What can I put in
here if I pick Vi?",01:11:46.270,01:11:49.680
AUDIENCE: Vi plus 1.,01:11:49.680,01:11:50.614
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,01:11:50.614,01:11:51.280
Vi plus 1 to j.,01:11:51.280,01:11:53.240
So the range becomes i plus 1 j.,01:11:53.240,01:11:57.480
"I have to be a little
careful here in terms",01:12:01.370,01:12:04.200
"of whether I can argue
that it's actually",01:12:04.200,01:12:10.270
the V that I put in here.,01:12:10.270,01:12:12.380
"So the subtlety here is
simply that the Vi plus 1 j",01:12:12.380,01:12:21.580
"is not something that
I see in front of me.",01:12:21.580,01:12:26.540
This is the complication.,01:12:26.540,01:12:28.090
"Vi plus 1 j is never a board
that I see in front of me,",01:12:28.090,01:12:33.260
"whereas Vij was a board
that I saw in front of me.",01:12:33.260,01:12:36.180
"So I have to model the boards
that I see in front of me,",01:12:36.180,01:12:41.370
"because those are the boards
that I have control over",01:12:41.370,01:12:43.922
that I can maximize.,01:12:43.922,01:12:44.755
"I cannot would be Vi
plus 1 j in there,",01:12:48.430,01:12:51.570
"simply because I don't
quite know what that is,",01:12:51.570,01:12:54.560
"because of what I get eventually
is not something I control.",01:12:54.560,01:12:58.890
"It's going to be the board
after my opponent has moved.",01:12:58.890,01:13:03.370
"So all I'm going to do is
I'm going to say the range",01:13:03.370,01:13:09.620
becomes-- range is i plus 1 j.,01:13:09.620,01:13:16.425
"And I'm going to say something
else in a second here.",01:13:19.600,01:13:22.280
The range is i j minus 1.,01:13:22.280,01:13:30.360
"And in both of these
cases, the opponent moves.",01:13:30.360,01:13:35.110
"So in order to actually
write out my DP,",01:13:40.810,01:13:43.960
"I'm going to have to now
look at the worst case",01:13:43.960,01:13:48.070
"situation in terms of
the board I get back,",01:13:48.070,01:13:52.084
"because the only times
I'm adding values",01:13:52.084,01:13:53.750
"is when I see a board in
front of me and I pick a coin.",01:13:53.750,01:13:56.460
"And I'm going to have to say
now the opponent is going",01:13:56.460,01:13:59.020
"to see an i plus 1 j-- or
an i j minus 1, excuse me,",01:13:59.020,01:14:05.740
and might do something.,01:14:05.740,01:14:07.590
"And I'm going to
get something back.",01:14:07.590,01:14:11.020
"I'm going to assume that
the opponent is just",01:14:11.020,01:14:13.260
"as smart as I am,
knows DP, taken",01:14:13.260,01:14:15.490
"6046, et cetera, et cetera.",01:14:15.490,01:14:18.420
"And I still want to
get the maximum value",01:14:18.420,01:14:21.350
that I can definitely win.,01:14:21.350,01:14:24.360
"And so we need to look
inside of that a little bit.",01:14:24.360,01:14:27.580
"And it's not that hard if
you just make the assumption",01:14:27.580,01:14:29.970
"that I just did,
which is the opponent",01:14:29.970,01:14:33.760
"is going to do-- I mean
might not necessarily",01:14:33.760,01:14:37.400
do the right thing.,01:14:37.400,01:14:38.530
"But you have to assume that
the opponent knows just as much",01:14:38.530,01:14:41.590
"as you do and is going to try
and do as well as possible.",01:14:41.590,01:14:47.090
So let's do that.,01:14:47.090,01:14:48.570
"That's the last thing
that we have to do here.",01:14:48.570,01:14:50.840
And it's just one more equation.,01:14:50.840,01:14:54.970
So here's the solution.,01:14:54.970,01:14:58.400
"We now have Vi plus 1 j
subproblem with the opponent",01:14:58.400,01:15:06.081
picking.,01:15:06.081,01:15:06.580
"And the simple
observation is that we",01:15:14.000,01:15:18.150
"are guaranteed the min
of Vi plus 1 j minus 1",01:15:18.150,01:15:29.930
or Vi plus 2 j.,01:15:29.930,01:15:34.420
"In this case, the opponent
picks Vj, and in this case,",01:15:34.420,01:15:44.325
the opponent picks Vi plus 1.,01:15:44.325,01:15:51.370
"And you're guaranteed
the minimum of these two,",01:15:51.370,01:15:54.700
"because the opponent
can only pick one coin.",01:15:54.700,01:15:56.870
"So that's the simple
observation that",01:15:56.870,01:15:59.830
"lets you jump ahead to your
next move, which is really",01:15:59.830,01:16:05.790
"what the DP is interested
in, because that's",01:16:05.790,01:16:10.560
"the only time that you're
actually executing something",01:16:10.560,01:16:13.060
"in terms of picking
coins from the board",01:16:13.060,01:16:15.020
and adding to your value.,01:16:15.020,01:16:16.850
"But we did have to model that
as to what the maximum value was",01:16:16.850,01:16:21.320
"that you could win,
jumping ahead of this move.",01:16:21.320,01:16:24.440
"And you have the min
in here because you're",01:16:24.440,01:16:26.470
"assuming that this is
a definite guarantee.",01:16:26.470,01:16:30.190
That's what we want.,01:16:30.190,01:16:31.700
"It's possible that the
opponent plays a different game",01:16:31.700,01:16:37.200
"from the one that we think
he or she is going to play,",01:16:37.200,01:16:40.720
which maximizes his or value.,01:16:40.720,01:16:43.230
But the min is guaranteed.,01:16:43.230,01:16:45.780
"So now that you've
made this observation,",01:16:45.780,01:16:48.150
"it turns out we just have to
take that, and we'll be done.",01:16:48.150,01:16:54.940
So let's see.,01:16:54.940,01:16:56.230
Let me erase this.,01:16:56.230,01:16:57.805
It's the last set of equations.,01:16:57.805,01:17:01.005
"And it's just plugging
in that observation",01:17:05.740,01:17:07.700
into what I wrote before.,01:17:07.700,01:17:10.030
So we have Vi j equals max.,01:17:10.030,01:17:14.655
"This is the outer max that
I had up there already,",01:17:14.655,01:17:17.820
so that's the same max.,01:17:17.820,01:17:20.620
"And put these giant
brackets here.",01:17:20.620,01:17:23.440
"And inside, I'm going to
plug in this min, which",01:17:26.250,01:17:31.950
"is something that
corresponds to the value",01:17:31.950,01:17:37.230
"that I would win
in the worst case",01:17:37.230,01:17:39.820
"after the opponent plays
the best possible move.",01:17:39.820,01:17:42.980
"And that would be Vi plus 1 j
minus 1, V1 plus 2 j plus Vi.",01:17:42.980,01:18:00.000
"This Vi is the same
as this one up here.",01:18:00.000,01:18:04.100
And you've got a plus Vj here.,01:18:06.990,01:18:10.200
"And I didn't actually
do this, but in terms",01:18:10.200,01:18:12.610
"of writing out what the opponent
would do in other subproblem",01:18:12.610,01:18:16.350
"case, but it's really
pretty straightforward.",01:18:16.350,01:18:19.450
"You have a problem
that corresponds",01:18:19.450,01:18:22.970
to the i j minus 1 problem.,01:18:22.970,01:18:26.260
"And the opponent
could pick the i-th",01:18:26.260,01:18:28.235
or could pick the j minus 1th.,01:18:28.235,01:18:30.417
"If the opponent picks
the j minus 1th,",01:18:30.417,01:18:32.000
"you get Vi j minus 2, and you
need to take the min of that.",01:18:32.000,01:18:38.460
"In the other case, where the
opponent picks i, in which case",01:18:38.460,01:18:42.520
you get i plus 1 j minus 1.,01:18:42.520,01:18:44.880
And that's our DP.,01:18:47.680,01:18:49.630
That's our DP.,01:18:49.630,01:18:52.450
"So the big difference
here was the modeling",01:18:52.450,01:18:55.970
"that you had to
do in the middle.",01:18:55.970,01:18:57.400
"We didn't actually have
to do that in any of DPs",01:18:57.400,01:19:00.270
"we've covered in 046 at
least up until this point.",01:19:00.270,01:19:07.320
"Before we talk about complexity,
that should just take a minute,",01:19:07.320,01:19:11.730
people buy that?,01:19:11.730,01:19:13.550
See that?,01:19:13.550,01:19:14.540
Good.,01:19:14.540,01:19:15.060
"So with all of these
problems, the complexities",01:19:15.060,01:19:18.660
"are fairly straightforward
to compute.",01:19:18.660,01:19:21.510
"The complexity here
is simply, again, as",01:19:21.510,01:19:24.360
"before, the number
of subproblems times",01:19:24.360,01:19:26.610
"the time it takes to
solve the subproblem.",01:19:26.610,01:19:30.300
"You can see here are that
these are all constant time",01:19:30.300,01:19:32.750
operations.,01:19:32.750,01:19:33.740
"So assuming that the
Vij's have been computed,",01:19:33.740,01:19:37.800
"it's theta 1 time to
compute a subproblem.",01:19:37.800,01:19:41.450
So that's your theta 1.,01:19:41.450,01:19:43.160
"And as before, there are
n squared subproblems.",01:19:43.160,01:19:47.950
Sorry.,01:19:47.950,01:19:48.460
"Let's just do number of
subproblems times theta 1.",01:19:48.460,01:19:53.150
It's just theta n squared.,01:19:53.150,01:19:56.480
So that was good.,01:19:56.480,01:19:58.360
All right.,01:19:58.360,01:19:58.900
So good luck for the quiz.,01:19:58.900,01:20:01.700
"And don't worry
too much about it.",01:20:01.700,01:20:04.400
See you guys next week.,01:20:04.400,01:20:06.541
