"PROFESSOR: So we started last
week on the big topic for the",00:00:15.520,00:00:24.080
"rest of the semester,
optimization.",00:00:24.080,00:00:26.630
"Maybe can you close that door
or just part way anyway.",00:00:26.630,00:00:30.780
Thanks.,00:00:30.780,00:00:32.900
Great.,00:00:32.900,00:00:33.320
"That's perfect, just
like that.",00:00:33.320,00:00:35.020
"So, since it was a few days ago,
I wanted to recap what I",00:00:35.020,00:00:44.640
"did in the first lecture about
optimization, which was to",00:00:44.640,00:00:48.970
"pick out the least squares
problem as a",00:00:48.970,00:00:53.110
beautiful model problem.,00:00:53.110,00:00:56.180
I followed that through --,00:00:56.180,00:01:00.140
"the input is a matrix a
rectangular, a right hand side",00:01:00.140,00:01:05.160
b probably measurements.,00:01:05.160,00:01:08.090
"We would like to get au
equal b but we can't.",00:01:08.090,00:01:12.730
We got too many measurements.,00:01:12.730,00:01:16.280
"We do the best possible, which
is the solution u hat of this",00:01:16.280,00:01:22.050
normal equation.,00:01:22.050,00:01:24.540
"Then I rewrote the normal
equations -- well, I also drew",00:01:24.540,00:01:29.470
"the picture that you see
over here on the left.",00:01:29.470,00:01:33.580
"The picture that shows
the two optimization",00:01:33.580,00:01:38.070
problems at the same time.,00:01:38.070,00:01:40.020
Here is the vector b.,00:01:40.020,00:01:42.530
Here are all possible au's --,00:01:42.530,00:01:46.180
"this is the column space,
this is all au's.",00:01:46.180,00:01:51.700
"The best au was the
projection.",00:01:51.700,00:01:55.570
"The error e was what we couldn't
get right, the part",00:01:55.570,00:02:01.390
"that's perpendicular to the
column space we can't help.",00:02:01.390,00:02:06.020
"It's the solution to another
projection problem that e is",00:02:06.020,00:02:11.010
"the same -- of course, it's
the same over here -- as",00:02:11.010,00:02:14.460
"projecting b onto this
perpendicular line, which is",00:02:14.460,00:02:20.150
"the line of all vectors,
a tranpose e says --",00:02:20.150,00:02:25.670
"what that says in words is
e is perpendicular to the",00:02:25.670,00:02:33.290
columns of a.,00:02:33.290,00:02:34.540
"I've drawn it the best
I could as a",00:02:40.140,00:02:43.150
perpendicular to the columns.,00:02:43.150,00:02:46.480
"So that we have a plane
of columns --",00:02:46.480,00:02:48.920
this is like a 3 x 2 matrix.,00:02:48.920,00:02:51.790
"We have a plane with the
two columns and the",00:02:51.790,00:02:57.230
perpendicular line.,00:02:57.230,00:02:59.830
"Then just near the end, I said
that it would be great to have",00:02:59.830,00:03:06.315
"-- this model would be almost
all we need except it should",00:03:06.315,00:03:10.240
"have one more matrix and
I call that matrix c.",00:03:10.240,00:03:18.160
"I want just to show you quickly
where that comes.",00:03:18.160,00:03:20.990
"So this is all section 7.1 of
the notes, except that these",00:03:20.990,00:03:30.080
words are not yet typed.,00:03:30.080,00:03:32.550
"So they'll, as soon as possible,
and an updated 7.1",00:03:32.550,00:03:37.660
"will include this, what
I want to do.",00:03:37.660,00:03:40.420
"Because I think it's the very
best introduction I could give",00:03:40.420,00:03:43.140
"to these pair of optimization
problems.",00:03:43.140,00:03:48.260
"You might think who needs
optimization.",00:03:48.260,00:03:51.040
"Your main activity
might be solving",00:03:54.750,00:03:57.470
differential equations.,00:03:57.470,00:04:00.000
"So, can I just take a time out
here because I happened to see",00:04:00.000,00:04:05.570
the homework upcoming.,00:04:05.570,00:04:09.020
"I think it's 16930, so it's a
course a little bit like this,",00:04:09.020,00:04:14.240
"only the first word in the
course title is ""Advanced,""",00:04:14.240,00:04:19.040
"and our first word is
""Introduction,"" but, of",00:04:19.040,00:04:21.930
"course, it's the same course
or same stuff.",00:04:21.930,00:04:27.110
"This is the homework that I
don't think has even been",00:04:27.110,00:04:29.680
"assigned, even been
handed out yet.",00:04:29.680,00:04:32.630
"But I just thought it's a great
example of a applied, so",00:04:32.630,00:04:40.970
"that you see where optimization
appears and",00:04:40.970,00:04:47.000
what's involved.,00:04:47.000,00:04:50.130
"So differential equations are
involved, but also you got",00:04:50.130,00:04:55.240
"something that you
want to optimize.",00:04:55.240,00:04:57.350
"So I just wrote it on this board
and I simplified it a",00:04:57.350,00:05:02.750
"little over the homework that
they'll actually get.",00:05:02.750,00:05:07.760
so here's the problem.,00:05:07.760,00:05:09.480
"We want a certain distribution
of heat.",00:05:09.480,00:05:12.670
So I could draw a picture.,00:05:12.670,00:05:16.410
"We want a heat distribution for
whatever reason that maybe",00:05:16.410,00:05:21.690
"goes like this over the
integral zero to 1.",00:05:21.690,00:05:26.020
"What do we have at our
disposal to get the",00:05:28.790,00:05:33.170
heat to be that way?,00:05:33.170,00:05:34.500
"Well, we've got sources
of heat.",00:05:34.500,00:05:36.950
"But we don't have a continuous
source, we only have n",00:05:36.950,00:05:50.540
parameters to play with.,00:05:50.540,00:05:52.640
"I mean right away
you recognize an",00:05:52.640,00:05:54.220
optimization problem.,00:05:54.220,00:05:55.770
"We're trying to get this
function here u knot of x.",00:05:55.770,00:05:59.430
"We're trying to match a
function, but we've only got n",00:06:02.660,00:06:05.260
parameters.,00:06:05.260,00:06:07.550
"Those will be the
right hand side.",00:06:07.550,00:06:12.180
"So what we're allowed to choose,
we can put in little",00:06:12.180,00:06:15.050
"space heaters, and we can turn
them to the temperatures we",00:06:15.050,00:06:19.330
"want to -- temperatures
s1, s2, s3.",00:06:19.330,00:06:23.900
"That was probably a stupid
choice to put an s for down",00:06:23.900,00:06:27.590
"there because I don't
even know if",00:06:27.590,00:06:30.230
negative heat is allowed.,00:06:30.230,00:06:32.940
"Anyway, we wouldn't want it
if we're aiming for that",00:06:32.940,00:06:37.110
distribution.,00:06:37.110,00:06:38.610
"Now you understand the s's
are not supposed to",00:06:38.610,00:06:41.370
match that u knot.,00:06:41.370,00:06:42.720
"The s's are the sources of
heat, and the u's are the",00:06:42.720,00:06:47.640
"outputs, the distribution, and
they are controlled by a",00:06:47.640,00:06:52.560
differential equation.,00:06:52.560,00:06:53.810
"What we control is the right
hand side of the equation, but",00:06:56.520,00:07:00.500
we only control n parameters.,00:07:00.500,00:07:03.490
"Then we have to solve the
equation and find out what",00:07:03.490,00:07:06.070
distribution that gives.,00:07:06.070,00:07:07.900
"So that's all like differential
equations, we",00:07:07.900,00:07:11.740
know how to do it.,00:07:11.740,00:07:13.950
"It's one dimensional in this
example, so straightforward.",00:07:13.950,00:07:18.680
"But now comes the optimization
part.",00:07:18.680,00:07:21.030
"We take this result
and we compare it",00:07:21.030,00:07:25.610
with the desired result.,00:07:25.610,00:07:28.340
"So the actual result from some
source of heat might be",00:07:28.340,00:07:33.390
something like that.,00:07:33.390,00:07:34.640
"We want this u of x, the heat
distribution that we're",00:07:38.380,00:07:49.250
"actually producing to be as
close as possible to u knot.",00:07:49.250,00:07:53.760
"Close could mean different
things, but if we measure",00:07:53.760,00:07:57.630
"closeness in this integral
square mean square sense, then",00:07:57.630,00:08:02.980
"we're going to have
nice problem.",00:08:02.980,00:08:05.460
"In fact, we're going
to have a linear --",00:08:05.460,00:08:06.950
everything's linear right now.,00:08:06.950,00:08:10.080
"Well, everything's quadratic
here, so when we minimize it's",00:08:10.080,00:08:13.930
"going to give us a linear
equation for the s's.",00:08:13.930,00:08:18.740
"I just think that's a
good model problem.",00:08:18.740,00:08:23.980
"A good model of what
we might do.",00:08:23.980,00:08:26.290
"I think actually in the problem
to be assigned --",00:08:26.290,00:08:32.330
"well, it's not a big
deal for us.",00:08:32.330,00:08:35.370
There is convection as well.,00:08:35.370,00:08:37.500
"So this is a pure diffusion
problem, just the second",00:08:37.500,00:08:41.910
derivative.,00:08:41.910,00:08:42.780
"We know very well that if there
was a first derivative",00:08:42.780,00:08:45.360
"in there, the stuff's
convecting, passing through",00:08:45.360,00:08:49.630
the region.,00:08:49.630,00:08:52.670
"So if I put on a convective
term, cdudx, how does that",00:08:52.670,00:09:02.660
change the problem?,00:09:02.660,00:09:04.110
"Not in a big, big major way, but
one thing we can guess is",00:09:04.110,00:09:09.580
"that now that is not a symmetric
term, right.",00:09:09.580,00:09:14.940
"We've seen the difference
between first differences and",00:09:14.940,00:09:18.530
"second differences, first
derivatives and second",00:09:18.530,00:09:20.950
derivatives.,00:09:20.950,00:09:21.360
"So now it's a little trickier
and it's not symmetric.",00:09:21.360,00:09:28.790
"So somehow there will be a
primal problem, this one, and",00:09:28.790,00:09:37.570
"there will be a adjoint
problem, dual problem,",00:09:37.570,00:09:42.580
"perpendicular problem, whatever
name you want to give",00:09:42.580,00:09:45.350
"it, just as there is in our very
first model over there.",00:09:45.350,00:09:51.790
"So that's my sort of quick look
to kind of put on the",00:09:51.790,00:09:59.220
"board one example that I didn't
invent, that came from",00:09:59.220,00:10:05.830
"applications and gives
a sort of typical of",00:10:05.830,00:10:11.260
what you have to do.,00:10:11.260,00:10:12.550
"You control an input, you get
an output, so that's the",00:10:12.550,00:10:18.870
analysis problem.,00:10:18.870,00:10:20.100
Find the output.,00:10:20.100,00:10:21.530
"But then comes the optimization
problem -- make",00:10:21.530,00:10:24.900
"that output close to something
that you wish.",00:10:24.900,00:10:27.880
"So what's the typical algorithm
going to do?",00:10:31.730,00:10:34.470
"It's going to make a choice of
s, it's going to solve the",00:10:34.470,00:10:40.970
"analysis problem for the u,
it's going to look and see",00:10:40.970,00:10:44.590
"what the error is, it's going
to figure out probably the",00:10:44.590,00:10:48.800
gradient somehow.,00:10:48.800,00:10:51.160
"What's the steepest way
to make it closer?",00:10:51.160,00:10:55.190
"That's going to lead us
to a change of s.",00:10:55.190,00:10:58.410
"We use a change of s, the new
s, solve that, and iterate.",00:10:58.410,00:11:03.450
"That would be a typical
algorithm.",00:11:03.450,00:11:06.110
"We might be able to shortcut
it in a model",00:11:06.110,00:11:08.980
problem like this.,00:11:08.980,00:11:09.750
"But that's totally the typical
optimization idea, is an",00:11:09.750,00:11:18.540
"analysis problem and then figure
out a gradient to get a",00:11:18.540,00:11:24.530
"better source back to
the analysis problem",00:11:24.530,00:11:27.510
with the new source.,00:11:27.510,00:11:29.040
"What the algebra, the math, has
to do is those two steps",00:11:32.390,00:11:37.120
"of figuring out OK, how do we
improve the error, how do we",00:11:37.120,00:11:43.760
"reduce the error, what's
the steepest direction?",00:11:43.760,00:11:46.660
"Somehow we got to compute
a derivative.",00:11:46.660,00:11:50.690
"Actually, that's what
this month is about.",00:11:50.690,00:11:54.310
"Derivatives that are not just
like the derivative of x cube",00:11:54.310,00:11:58.310
or something.,00:11:58.310,00:12:00.990
"I often wondered how many
presidents could take the",00:12:00.990,00:12:04.470
"derivative of x cube
and I'm not sure.",00:12:04.470,00:12:08.340
"Anybody occur to you who you
could count on being able to",00:12:12.170,00:12:15.460
"take the derivative
of x cubed?",00:12:15.460,00:12:18.080
"I don't think the current
president would",00:12:18.080,00:12:20.260
know what it meant.,00:12:20.260,00:12:21.980
"But I think Carter could have
done it, because he went to",00:12:21.980,00:12:25.490
the Naval Academy.,00:12:25.490,00:12:27.170
"Jefferson was probably --
he knew everything.",00:12:27.170,00:12:30.180
I don't know.,00:12:32.720,00:12:33.270
"Anybody else has another
candidate they can tell me.",00:12:33.270,00:12:37.280
"So there is our problem --
finding derivatives that would",00:12:37.280,00:12:43.080
"be definitely beyond the
capacity of the White House.",00:12:43.080,00:12:47.140
"Now I want to stay with this
model a little more because",00:12:52.140,00:13:01.720
it's the perfect model.,00:13:01.720,00:13:05.440
"So this was the like model 1,
unweighted ordinary least",00:13:05.440,00:13:09.710
"squared, and it produced the
identity matrix in there.",00:13:09.710,00:13:14.400
"I mentioned last time what I
want to do, the more general",00:13:14.400,00:13:18.690
"model has another symmetric
positive-definite matrix in",00:13:18.690,00:13:23.920
"there, but not necessarily i,
and it comes from weighted",00:13:23.920,00:13:29.110
least squares.,00:13:29.110,00:13:30.640
"So that's what I'm going
to talk about.",00:13:30.640,00:13:33.070
"So what are weighted
least squares.",00:13:33.070,00:13:35.050
"Well, you've got these
measurements and you think",00:13:35.050,00:13:40.800
"they maybe don't all, maybe
they're not independent, maybe",00:13:40.800,00:13:46.650
they're not equally reliable.,00:13:46.650,00:13:49.320
"So you weight them by how
reliable they are.",00:13:49.320,00:13:52.930
"A more reliable one you would
put a heavier weight, w, on",00:13:52.930,00:13:56.760
"because you want that to
be more important.",00:13:56.760,00:14:00.410
"So, you change to
this problem.",00:14:00.410,00:14:05.000
"But it looks practically
the same.",00:14:05.000,00:14:06.730
"The only difference is a has
become wa, b has become wb.",00:14:06.730,00:14:12.400
"So the equations will be the
same, but a is now wa, b is",00:14:12.400,00:14:17.650
"now wb, and those are
the equations.",00:14:17.650,00:14:22.140
"I guess I should call, just
to make clear that u is a",00:14:22.140,00:14:25.370
"different u, that the best
u now depends on",00:14:25.370,00:14:29.880
the choice of weights.,00:14:29.880,00:14:31.410
"I should really be calling that
u -- somehow indicate",00:14:31.410,00:14:35.400
that it depends on the weight.,00:14:35.400,00:14:37.940
"Now they key nice thing is that
if I write this out as a",00:14:37.940,00:14:42.890
tranpose --,00:14:42.890,00:14:45.690
can you just write this out.,00:14:45.690,00:14:49.080
"You get the a tranpose, and
the a is over here.",00:14:49.080,00:14:53.500
But what's in the middle?,00:14:53.500,00:14:56.460
What's this matrix c --,00:14:56.460,00:14:58.160
"I jumped the gun and called that
matrix in the middle c,",00:14:58.160,00:15:02.230
but how is it connected to w?,00:15:02.230,00:15:05.920
"You can see it here as c
is w tranpose w, right?",00:15:05.920,00:15:12.390
"It's just sitting there
in the middle.",00:15:12.390,00:15:14.180
"That's great that the fact
that the combination w",00:15:14.180,00:15:18.000
"tranpose w is all you
need to know.",00:15:18.000,00:15:21.160
"So we can forget w
in favor of --",00:15:21.160,00:15:26.405
"I'll just put it here -- w
tranpose w is now given the",00:15:26.405,00:15:31.420
"name c, and this matrix is
symmetric positive-definite.",00:15:31.420,00:15:35.690
"So it's a great matrix and it's
exactly the one we want.",00:15:40.440,00:15:44.920
"This is exactly the
equation we want.",00:15:44.920,00:15:48.850
"So if I go back to writing it in
this -- you know, this was",00:15:48.850,00:15:53.980
the equation.,00:15:53.980,00:15:56.210
"You remember the point that we
could go directly to one",00:15:56.210,00:16:01.920
"equation for the best u, or we
could keep our options open",00:16:01.920,00:16:09.160
"and have two equations that
led to the same one.",00:16:09.160,00:16:15.530
They're totally equivalent.,00:16:15.530,00:16:17.410
"But the two equations will give
us not only u, but the",00:16:17.410,00:16:21.560
"error, b minus au, as
an other unknown.",00:16:21.560,00:16:25.960
That's what we did up there.,00:16:25.960,00:16:27.230
"So we had two equations,
and if we",00:16:27.230,00:16:29.920
eliminated e we got to this.,00:16:29.920,00:16:34.500
"Now I want to have two
equations, and if I eliminate",00:16:34.500,00:16:37.710
"e, I get to that.",00:16:37.710,00:16:40.530
"So let me see what
those would be.",00:16:40.530,00:16:44.450
"Well, here's one of them.",00:16:44.450,00:16:47.000
"a tranpose c -- e is zero --
you see, that's the only",00:16:47.000,00:16:53.640
difference really.,00:16:53.640,00:16:55.150
"That the weighted normal
equation, I just took a",00:16:55.150,00:17:02.000
"tranpose c, and then I took the
b minus au together, and",00:17:02.000,00:17:06.110
this is what I'm calling e.,00:17:06.110,00:17:08.510
"So one way to do it is just the
new guy is just now e plus",00:17:08.510,00:17:15.170
auw is still b.,00:17:15.170,00:17:19.630
But now a tranpose ce is zero.,00:17:19.630,00:17:25.920
Good deal.,00:17:25.920,00:17:26.570
I mean that's quite nice.,00:17:26.570,00:17:29.040
"It isn't absolutely perfect
though, because",00:17:31.950,00:17:35.190
I've lost the symmetry.,00:17:35.190,00:17:36.380
"I'm putting a c in there and
I don't really want it.",00:17:36.380,00:17:39.920
"I want a c but I don't
want it there.",00:17:39.920,00:17:42.720
"So, I just make a
small change.",00:17:42.720,00:17:46.970
"I'm going to introduce a new
unknown that I'll call little",00:17:46.970,00:17:50.480
"w, apologies for the fact that
it's also a w, it just",00:17:50.480,00:17:56.560
happened to fit.,00:17:56.560,00:17:58.410
That'll be the ce.,00:17:58.410,00:18:02.730
"So I'm just calling this
a new name here.",00:18:02.730,00:18:07.960
"So that now my e -- of course,
if I just invert, e",00:18:07.960,00:18:12.230
is c inverse w.,00:18:12.230,00:18:14.970
"So now I'm just going to write
these equations with w instead",00:18:14.970,00:18:19.690
of e because I like it better.,00:18:19.690,00:18:21.580
"So this equation is now a
tranpose w equals zero.",00:18:21.580,00:18:29.000
"This equation e is disappeared
in favor of c inverse w plus",00:18:29.000,00:18:36.980
au equals b.,00:18:36.980,00:18:42.100
"So that's the system
that I really like.",00:18:42.100,00:18:45.300
"That's the saddle point system,
the Kuhn-Tucker",00:18:45.300,00:18:48.100
"system, the primal dual system,
the fundamental system",00:18:48.100,00:18:51.080
"of the whole subject in this
linear matrix case.",00:18:51.080,00:18:59.230
"We haven't got functions, we
got vectors, and we've got",00:18:59.230,00:19:03.740
"symmetry, and we've got
linearity, and we've got a",00:19:03.740,00:19:10.570
"saddle point matrix that's now
the s -- well, let me just",00:19:10.570,00:19:16.720
change it here.,00:19:16.720,00:19:19.060
"It's just changed to
this, c inverse.",00:19:19.060,00:19:23.430
"That's the fundamental matrix
of the whole subject.",00:19:23.430,00:19:28.090
"So, s is the saddle
point matrix.",00:19:28.090,00:19:30.740
So I wanted to get that far.,00:19:38.300,00:19:41.230
"You see that the whole picture
was elementary linear algebra.",00:19:41.230,00:19:46.470
"Let me come back to the
elementary figure that",00:19:46.470,00:19:52.780
"illustrates what's
the geometry.",00:19:52.780,00:19:55.950
"How was the geometry affected
by introducing this guy w,",00:19:55.950,00:20:02.630
"this weighting matrix or the
c equal w transport w?",00:20:02.630,00:20:07.320
"Well, here was the picture
from last time.",00:20:07.320,00:20:12.020
A right angle picture.,00:20:12.020,00:20:14.390
This was a right triangle.,00:20:14.390,00:20:16.810
"This line was perpendicular
to that plane,",00:20:16.810,00:20:22.050
but not anymore now.,00:20:22.050,00:20:23.500
"The second one it's a
tranpose ce is zero.",00:20:23.500,00:20:31.440
"That's still a line, but it's
not any longer perpendicular",00:20:31.440,00:20:36.380
"to the -- this is still
all the au's.",00:20:36.380,00:20:41.010
"This plane is still the column
space of all the au's.",00:20:41.010,00:20:44.600
"We have the same b, but you see
the problem is it lost its",00:20:47.380,00:20:54.780
"90 degree angle, because
the projection is now a",00:20:54.780,00:21:00.850
"projection, it's now an oblique",00:21:00.850,00:21:03.860
"projection, it's slanted.",00:21:03.860,00:21:05.990
"This is the best au, and if I
occasionally keep up-to-date",00:21:05.990,00:21:12.360
I'll put that uw there.,00:21:12.360,00:21:16.190
"There's still an error e, and
this is still a parallelogram",00:21:16.190,00:21:19.800
"but it's not a rectangle
anymore.",00:21:19.800,00:21:21.340
Forgive my enthusiasm.,00:21:25.350,00:21:27.620
"I'm sort of happy that the
picture and the algebra both",00:21:27.620,00:21:32.400
come out so neatly.,00:21:32.400,00:21:36.230
"I totally agree that at this
point I'm asking you to follow",00:21:36.230,00:21:41.690
"a model without giving you an
application, and that's one",00:21:41.690,00:21:47.930
"reason I threw in this mention
of a specific application that",00:21:47.930,00:21:53.910
came from somewhere else.,00:21:53.910,00:21:55.840
But this is the picture there.,00:21:55.840,00:21:59.850
"So I'll say one more word
about the picture.",00:21:59.850,00:22:07.280
"I said that we lost
the right angle.",00:22:07.280,00:22:11.790
"We lost perpendicularity,
and, of course,",00:22:11.790,00:22:16.110
literally speaking we did.,00:22:16.110,00:22:18.360
"This is no longer -- this is
not a right angle anymore.",00:22:18.360,00:22:25.870
"This is not a right
angle anymore.",00:22:25.870,00:22:27.870
"It's not a right angle in the
usual meaning of right angles.",00:22:34.000,00:22:41.220
"It is a right angle in the
inner product that's",00:22:41.220,00:22:48.540
associated with c.,00:22:48.540,00:22:49.660
"In other words, right
angles here mean x",00:22:49.660,00:22:52.235
transpose y equals zero.,00:22:52.235,00:22:55.870
"That's the idea of a right
angle, right? x perpendicular",00:22:55.870,00:23:00.220
"to y, and they have different
letters here.",00:23:00.220,00:23:03.720
"Now over here I still have
perpendicular, but I don't --",00:23:03.720,00:23:10.870
"this is not the right inner
product anymore.",00:23:10.870,00:23:14.060
"It should be a weighted inner
product, weighted with this c",00:23:14.060,00:23:19.050
in the middle.,00:23:19.050,00:23:20.600
"So that's really what I
mean by c orthogonal.",00:23:20.600,00:23:26.660
"Maybe I'll put those
words down.",00:23:26.660,00:23:28.560
"So this weighted thing is -- if
I can squeeze it, I doubt",00:23:28.560,00:23:33.270
"if I can -- is c orthogonality,
weighted",00:23:33.270,00:23:40.270
orthogonality.,00:23:40.270,00:23:41.670
"So let me circle the
whole thing.",00:23:41.670,00:23:44.250
The c is the w tranpose w.,00:23:44.250,00:23:47.500
"Just to say that we aren't
giving up on dot products and",00:23:47.500,00:23:53.270
"perpendiculars and good
equations, we're just changing",00:23:53.270,00:23:57.520
"them by inserting c every
time in a product.",00:23:57.520,00:24:04.240
"What it means is that this is
the natural inner product for",00:24:04.240,00:24:09.250
the particular problem.,00:24:09.250,00:24:12.590
"This is the natural inner
product for Euclid, right?",00:24:12.590,00:24:16.230
"But then from some specific
application like this one or a",00:24:16.230,00:24:19.720
"million others, they have
their own natural inner",00:24:19.720,00:24:24.140
"product, and the inner product
for that particular problem",00:24:24.140,00:24:27.900
"would be one of these guys with
some kind of a matrix c",00:24:27.900,00:24:33.030
showing up.,00:24:33.030,00:24:35.410
"So least squares and weighted
least squares, that's my",00:24:35.410,00:24:41.270
example one.,00:24:41.270,00:24:44.600
"Now I'd like to give a second
example, a more mechanic --",00:24:44.600,00:24:51.200
will come closer to mechanics.,00:24:51.200,00:24:53.280
"Because this is least squares,
statistics, algebra.",00:24:53.280,00:24:59.030
"But let me put on the
middle board an",00:24:59.030,00:25:02.360
application out of mechanics.,00:25:02.360,00:25:05.170

small and just a couple of",00:25:05.170,00:25:13.930

"This spring extends
by some amount.",00:25:32.600,00:25:35.380
There's a force on this mass.,00:25:35.380,00:25:37.580
"So there's a force on there
mass, maybe just gravity, f.",00:25:37.580,00:25:42.130
"That's the external force from
the mass of that's here in",00:25:46.270,00:25:52.220
between the springs.,00:25:52.220,00:25:54.200
"Then also acting on that
mass are spring forces.",00:25:54.200,00:26:02.090

it up, right?",00:26:02.090,00:26:05.130

me to draw --",00:26:10.700,00:26:14.330

is this?",00:26:14.330,00:26:16.670
"I'm going to draw it this way
just to show the w2 drawn that",00:26:16.670,00:26:26.810
"way would actually be negative,
because I think that",00:26:26.810,00:26:33.070
"this spring would get
compressed, right -- this mass",00:26:33.070,00:26:36.550
is pushing it down.,00:26:36.550,00:26:38.090
"This spring would be
under compression.",00:26:38.090,00:26:40.310
"It would be pushing
the mass back up.",00:26:40.310,00:26:44.040
"So the w2 in that picture
would be negative.",00:26:44.040,00:26:48.440
"So this w1 will actually be
positive and go the way the",00:26:48.440,00:26:53.880

equations have we got then?",00:27:01.400,00:27:10.850

have a choice.",00:27:13.070,00:27:14.470

is pretty obvious.",00:27:20.270,00:27:22.870
This mass is an equilibrium.,00:27:22.870,00:27:24.700
So w1 is equal to w2 plus s.,00:27:24.700,00:27:30.940
So it doesn't move.,00:27:30.940,00:27:33.130

it, I would rather write",00:27:33.130,00:27:36.660

statement of",00:29:37.410,00:29:41.100
the mechanical problem.,00:29:41.100,00:29:46.610
"Well, I guess all that
remains is -- well,",00:29:50.940,00:29:54.650
I guess what remains?,00:29:54.650,00:29:55.910
"First of all, I need an
expression for this energy.",00:29:55.910,00:30:01.670
"If the springs are governed by
Hooke's law, then it'll be",00:30:01.670,00:30:06.520
pretty simple.,00:30:06.520,00:30:08.400
"If they're real springs that
don't quite obey Hooke's law",00:30:08.400,00:30:12.050
"then there'll be none -- no,
there'll be fourth degree,",00:30:12.050,00:30:17.010
"sixth degree , whatever,
terms in the energy.",00:30:17.010,00:30:21.190
"It's like the energy in the
first spring plus the energy",00:30:21.190,00:30:25.110
"in the second spring, anyway.",00:30:25.110,00:30:27.970
"e in the first spring, and the
energy in a second spring,",00:30:27.970,00:30:33.960
"and, of course, the two springs
could have different",00:30:33.960,00:30:36.170
spring constants.,00:30:36.170,00:30:37.420
So those e's --,00:30:40.280,00:30:43.330
"I'll make life easy in solving,
if I choose Hooke's",00:30:43.330,00:30:50.570
"law, if I choose the energy
to be just a square.",00:30:50.570,00:30:54.930
"The constraint is linear, so
that'll be the model problem.",00:30:57.700,00:31:03.500
"And actually, that'll be the
kind of problem I've got here.",00:31:03.500,00:31:09.850
"One reason for introducing a
new example was to get some",00:31:14.120,00:31:19.740
"mechanics into the lecture,
but also to get a problem",00:31:19.740,00:31:26.770
"where we're doing a minimization
but we've got a",00:31:26.770,00:31:33.160
condition on the w's.,00:31:33.160,00:31:36.670
"The question is how do
you find a minimum?",00:31:36.670,00:31:42.090
"You can't just set derivatives
of the energy to zero.",00:31:42.090,00:31:45.170
"You would discover w1 equal
w2 equals zero.",00:31:45.170,00:31:48.520
Nothing happening.,00:31:48.520,00:31:50.770
That would be the minimum.,00:31:50.770,00:31:52.680
"But that minimum is ruled out,
that solution is ruled out",00:31:52.680,00:31:57.900
"because we have this
constraint.",00:31:57.900,00:32:00.340
"We've got to balance
the external force.",00:32:00.340,00:32:03.920
"So this is the question and
you'll maybe have met this",00:32:03.920,00:32:09.320
"question in other courses,
but it's essential.",00:32:09.320,00:32:15.870
"How do you deal with minimizing
when there's a",00:32:15.870,00:32:19.670
constraint?,00:32:19.670,00:32:21.690
"I guess in some way we
had it over here.",00:32:21.690,00:32:26.520
"We were minimizing something --
well, the minimum would be,",00:32:26.520,00:32:30.450
take u equal u knot.,00:32:30.450,00:32:32.480
"But no, there was a constraint
that u had to satisfy a",00:32:32.480,00:32:38.660
certain equilibrium equation.,00:32:38.660,00:32:43.240
"Here it was a differential
equation so that problem is a",00:32:43.240,00:32:45.780
"little harder than this one
where the equation is just",00:32:45.780,00:32:52.280
"discrete, one simple equation.",00:32:52.280,00:32:56.690
So how are you going to do it?,00:32:56.690,00:32:58.080
"Well, actually the quickest way
would be -- that's such an",00:32:58.080,00:33:05.910
"easy constraint that I could
say hey, w2 is w1 minus f.",00:33:05.910,00:33:12.040
"So I could just, if I wanted to
really like shortcut this",00:33:12.040,00:33:16.060
"whole lecture, I could say
well, w2 is w1 minus f.",00:33:16.060,00:33:21.170
"Now I've accounted for
the constraint.",00:33:24.690,00:33:27.440
"I've removed w2 from
the problem.",00:33:27.440,00:33:30.560
"I have a minimization, an
ordinary minimization with an",00:33:30.560,00:33:33.980
unknown w1.,00:33:33.980,00:33:35.240
I take the derivative.,00:33:35.240,00:33:37.410
"I solve derivative
equals zero.",00:33:37.410,00:33:40.230
"I find w1, then I go back,
I get that w2.",00:33:40.230,00:33:43.610
That's the fast way.,00:33:43.610,00:33:44.860
"Of course, gets the
right answer.",00:33:47.880,00:33:49.450
"But there's another way
that in the end",00:33:49.450,00:33:53.720
turns out to be better.,00:33:53.720,00:33:56.980
"It's not necessarily better for
this simple problem, but",00:33:56.980,00:34:00.610
"it's better for the general
approach to constrained",00:34:00.610,00:34:08.450
optimization.,00:34:08.450,00:34:09.780
"So I'm going to not do the
simple deal of solving for w2,",00:34:09.780,00:34:16.320
"but I'm going to keep the
constraint around.",00:34:16.320,00:34:19.680
"It's the idea of Lagrange
multipliers.",00:34:19.680,00:34:23.900
"You've heard those words and
probably seen it happen.",00:34:23.900,00:34:30.550
"So what is Lagrange
multiplier?",00:34:30.550,00:34:32.570
What is Lagrange's idea?,00:34:32.570,00:34:34.650
"Lagrange's idea is he
constructed a function of w,",00:34:34.650,00:34:41.540
"which is this to work with,
which is the same energy.",00:34:41.540,00:34:47.230
"But he's going to include
a multiplier.",00:34:47.230,00:34:49.660
"Now the next question is what
letter shall I use for that",00:34:49.660,00:34:52.890
"multiplier, Lagrange's
multiplier.",00:34:52.890,00:34:57.260
"Books on optimization often
call it Lambda --",00:34:57.260,00:35:02.840
"Lambda's sort of like
for Lagrange.",00:35:02.840,00:35:06.560
"So, Lagrange obviously wasn't
Greek, but anyway -- close.",00:35:06.560,00:35:11.410
"Lambda for us always
means eigenvalue --",00:35:11.410,00:35:17.780
"For me always means
eigenvalue.",00:35:17.780,00:35:19.490
"So I'm reluctant
to use Lambda.",00:35:19.490,00:35:22.840
"Sometimes in books on economics,
which is we're",00:35:22.840,00:35:30.100
"doing this all the time, the
multiplier's called pi because",00:35:30.100,00:35:37.610
it turns out to be a price.,00:35:37.610,00:35:39.570
"But let me use u for the
Lagrange multiplier.",00:35:43.200,00:35:50.350
"So that'll be the Lagrange
multiplier.",00:35:53.770,00:35:56.100
So what do I do with it?,00:35:56.100,00:35:57.420
"I multiply this equation by u
and I build it in to this.",00:35:57.420,00:36:04.340
So this thing is this part --,00:36:04.340,00:36:07.040
"I'll just copy that down there
-- plus or minus, depending",00:36:07.040,00:36:11.590
"what I want, depending which
sign I want to end up with, u",00:36:11.590,00:36:16.510
"the multiplier times the
constraint -- w1 minus w2 --",00:36:16.510,00:36:21.980
let me put it like that.,00:36:21.980,00:36:25.210
"So the constraint is that
this should be zero.",00:36:25.210,00:36:29.140
"So you can say I haven't
added anything.",00:36:29.140,00:36:32.170
I've added zero.,00:36:32.170,00:36:34.770
"But that will only be true
at the end when I have a",00:36:34.770,00:36:41.840
specific w1 and w2.,00:36:41.840,00:36:43.650
"Right now what I've done is I've
built in the constraint",00:36:43.650,00:36:48.700
into the function.,00:36:48.700,00:36:50.430
"Lagrange's brilliant idea was
that now I've got a function",00:36:53.070,00:36:58.940
"that I can -- my derivatives
I can take.",00:36:58.940,00:37:03.960
"I could set the derivatives to
zero. dldw1 is going to be",00:37:03.960,00:37:09.940
"zero. dldw2 is going
to be zero.",00:37:09.940,00:37:14.420
And dldu is going to be zero.,00:37:14.420,00:37:20.310
"So we got now three equations,
three unknown.",00:37:20.310,00:37:24.540
"Instead of going from two
to one, we've gone",00:37:24.540,00:37:26.760
from two up to three.,00:37:26.760,00:37:29.360
"But it's so much more systematic
that it's the right",00:37:29.360,00:37:33.680
thing to do.,00:37:33.680,00:37:35.470
What is this last equation?,00:37:35.470,00:37:38.580
"What's the u derivative
of an expression?",00:37:38.580,00:37:42.130
"Well, u doesn't appear here, the
derivative is just w1 --",00:37:42.130,00:37:48.260
"this just leads us to w1 minus
w2 minus f, which is the",00:37:48.260,00:37:54.670
constraint that we wanted.,00:37:54.670,00:37:56.000
"So the constraint is showing
up as this equation.",00:37:56.000,00:38:05.740
"Just the way the constraint
showed up as",00:38:05.740,00:38:09.910
this equation here.,00:38:09.910,00:38:11.160
"I guess what I want to say is
when I wrote this down, when",00:38:15.480,00:38:24.900
"we did this first example,
I didn't say here's the",00:38:24.900,00:38:30.580
constraint.,00:38:30.580,00:38:31.820
"I mean that equation kind of
came out from the normal",00:38:31.820,00:38:37.450
equations here.,00:38:37.450,00:38:38.700
"So what we're doing new here is
the constraint equation is",00:38:42.540,00:38:48.950
"sort of part of the mechanics
and we're asking the question",00:38:48.950,00:38:52.290
how do I deal with it.,00:38:52.290,00:38:55.280
"Here it came out of the
geometry, so it wasn't there",00:38:55.280,00:38:59.950
"at the beginning so we didn't
have to say how do we deal",00:38:59.950,00:39:02.280
with this equation.,00:39:02.280,00:39:03.730
It just emerged.,00:39:03.730,00:39:05.620
"Here it's really forced
on us right away.",00:39:05.620,00:39:11.220
"So anyway, we've still got to
figure out the derivatives of",00:39:11.220,00:39:16.940
"those, and I guess I do have
to finally now say",00:39:16.940,00:39:19.730
what choice -- yeah.,00:39:19.730,00:39:24.560
So this is --,00:39:24.560,00:39:26.690
"what is this, the derivative
of e1 minus u.",00:39:26.690,00:39:36.210
"If I take the w1 derivative,
I've got the derivative of v1",00:39:36.210,00:39:39.830
with respect to w1.,00:39:39.830,00:39:43.300
"Then w1 doesn't appear there
but it appears here,",00:39:43.300,00:39:47.130
so it's minus u.,00:39:47.130,00:39:50.370
"This would be the derivative of
v2 with respect to w2, that",00:39:50.370,00:39:55.110
"second spring minus --
oh maybe plus cu.",00:39:55.110,00:39:59.040
"Well, those are the
three equations.",00:40:05.680,00:40:08.140
"Let me move now to the linear
case, just so we see the",00:40:10.890,00:40:17.480
beautiful pattern.,00:40:17.480,00:40:19.530
"So if I make the equations
linear, what's the energy in",00:40:19.530,00:40:29.290
"Hooke's law spring here if the
extension is e1 and if it",00:40:29.290,00:40:39.360
"produces a force of w1, I want
to know what is this e1 here.",00:40:39.360,00:40:44.970
"So let me just remember
Hooke's law.",00:40:44.970,00:40:48.590
"I think Hooke's law would say
that -- well, there's some",00:40:48.590,00:40:53.840
"elastic constant c1, so there's
a c1 and a c2 that",00:40:53.840,00:40:59.520
"tell us how hard or soft
the springs are.",00:40:59.520,00:41:02.810
"So these are physical
constants.",00:41:02.810,00:41:04.890
"If I remember right,
the energy --",00:41:12.200,00:41:16.500
"so I'm going to erase a little
here just to -- well no.",00:41:16.500,00:41:20.170
"So what is the energy in
that first spring?",00:41:20.170,00:41:23.410
"You remember, there's a 1/2
of an c1 e1 squared.",00:41:23.410,00:41:31.650
"That's the energy in a spring
with constant c1 and the",00:41:31.650,00:41:38.800
stretch e1.,00:41:38.800,00:41:40.050
"But now I really want it not in
terms of e1, I want it in",00:41:45.280,00:41:48.770
"terms of w1, just the
way I did here.",00:41:48.770,00:41:53.470
"I've got to do the
same thing here.",00:41:53.470,00:41:54.870
"I want to get to w, because
the constraint",00:41:54.870,00:41:58.850
is in terms of w.,00:41:58.850,00:42:00.630
What does Hooke's law say?,00:42:03.290,00:42:04.820
"Hooke's law says w equals ce,
that's Hooke, Hooke's law.",00:42:04.820,00:42:12.510
"The fourth is the elastic
constant times the stretch.",00:42:15.400,00:42:19.460
"So in place of the e
I have w over c.",00:42:19.460,00:42:24.650
"So this is 1/2, e1 squared will
be w1 squared over c1",00:42:24.650,00:42:32.310
"squared, and then a c1 cancels
-- that's what it looks like.",00:42:32.310,00:42:36.520
"I guess I'm certainly happy
to see that I'm",00:42:40.450,00:42:45.390
coming up with c inverse.,00:42:45.390,00:42:47.380
"This c is showing up in the
denominator, and that's",00:42:47.380,00:42:52.320
"exactly the -- so this is what
I mean, this is what I want",00:42:52.320,00:42:56.620
"for my energy is a 1/2, w1
squared over c1, and a 1/2, w2",00:42:56.620,00:43:07.880
"squared over c2, and now I was
doing a minus sign because",00:43:07.880,00:43:16.820
"that kind of goes well with
mechanics where a plus sign",00:43:16.820,00:43:21.580
"would go well with all the
other applications.",00:43:21.580,00:43:26.720
"So now I've got explicit
energy.",00:43:26.720,00:43:31.650
"So now I can say what
this thing really --",00:43:31.650,00:43:35.400
"the derivative with
respect to w1.",00:43:35.400,00:43:37.860
OK.,00:43:37.860,00:43:39.130
"The derivative with respect
to w1 is just w1 over c1.",00:43:39.130,00:43:44.740
Is that what I'm getting?,00:43:44.740,00:43:46.770
This is zero.,00:43:46.770,00:43:48.520
"This says w2 over c2 minus u is
zero, and this one says w1",00:43:48.520,00:43:58.320
minus w2 equals f.,00:43:58.320,00:44:00.440
Our three equations.,00:44:04.120,00:44:07.200
"Yes, so I will help kill these
equal signs and just look at",00:44:07.200,00:44:13.885
"-- oh, that's a plus.",00:44:13.885,00:44:17.740
"We've got our saddle
point matrix again.",00:44:29.090,00:44:32.170
That's the nice thing here.,00:44:32.170,00:44:34.950
"This is a problem with a 3 x 3
matrix, with three unknowns,",00:44:34.950,00:44:40.410
"w1, w2, and u.",00:44:40.410,00:44:43.760
"With right hand side
zero zero and f.",00:44:43.760,00:44:47.320
With what matrix?,00:44:54.700,00:44:56.030
"That looks like a 1 over
c1, zero and a minus 1.",00:44:59.190,00:45:06.110
"This looks like zero, a 1
over c2 and a plus 1.",00:45:06.110,00:45:12.640
"This looks like -- oh,
wait a minute.",00:45:12.640,00:45:16.240
I don't want this.,00:45:16.240,00:45:18.880
w1 minus w2 equal f.,00:45:18.880,00:45:21.870
"I can live with 1 and minus 1
there, but it's not really",00:45:25.500,00:45:30.130
what I wanted.,00:45:30.130,00:45:33.040
"I wanted the signs to -- you
know what I want here.",00:45:33.040,00:45:37.140
"I want the transpose of that to
be here, and zero to be in",00:45:37.140,00:45:41.550
that block.,00:45:41.550,00:45:42.330
"So that's what my saddle point
matrix would look like.",00:45:42.330,00:45:50.200
"Well, let me just say that
I could live with either.",00:45:50.200,00:45:55.460
"I was aiming for this one
because it's symmetric.",00:45:55.460,00:46:03.450
"But a lot of people would rather
have the opposite signs",00:46:03.450,00:46:09.180
and have the 1 minus 1 there.,00:46:09.180,00:46:16.140
"I don't care which sign
f has, of course.",00:46:16.140,00:46:22.190
"Some people these days are
liking this form better",00:46:22.190,00:46:25.640
"because then it has a symmetric
part and an",00:46:25.640,00:46:28.570
anti-symmetric part.,00:46:28.570,00:46:29.820
"I mean the thing is at some
point we're going to get",00:46:33.160,00:46:37.640
"problems like this with
thousands of unknowns, and",00:46:37.640,00:46:41.950
"we're going to think how
do we solve them",00:46:41.950,00:46:44.690
and maybe some iteration.,00:46:44.690,00:46:47.640
"So we might want the matrix to
be symmetric but indefinite,",00:46:47.640,00:46:53.750
"or we might want a
positive-definite symmetric",00:46:53.750,00:46:59.040
"part and an anti-symmetric
part.",00:46:59.040,00:47:01.360
"What we can't have is positive
definite-symmetric.",00:47:04.350,00:47:07.840
"That's like asking for what
can't happen here.",00:47:07.840,00:47:11.880
"The combination of the problems
is producing a saddle",00:47:11.880,00:47:16.600
"point and we can play with that
sign, but we can't make",00:47:16.600,00:47:27.650
"that zero something -- oh,
we could actually.",00:47:27.650,00:47:33.140
"What I was going to say is we
can't make that zero something",00:47:33.140,00:47:36.970
"different, but you could.",00:47:36.970,00:47:40.520
"That would be a possible
way to --",00:47:40.520,00:47:44.260
"it's another way people thought
of of solving these",00:47:44.260,00:47:47.010
"problems is artificially throw
in a big number there, or even",00:47:47.010,00:47:56.240
"a small number, and push things
towards positive.",00:47:56.240,00:48:02.590
"Anyway, my purpose today is
essentially completed, that",00:48:02.590,00:48:10.910
"we're getting out of physical
application after I linearized",00:48:10.910,00:48:17.520
"and it became a linear equation
and it had that",00:48:17.520,00:48:21.210
saddle point form.,00:48:21.210,00:48:22.380
"So, saddle point form here,
saddle point form here, saddle",00:48:22.380,00:48:26.800
point forms everywhere.,00:48:26.800,00:48:28.120
"I mean we'll have the saddle
point forms for differential",00:48:28.120,00:48:31.940
"equations, as well as for
matrix equations.",00:48:31.940,00:48:36.390
"So those are the examples to
sort of hang on to, and it's",00:48:36.390,00:48:46.850
"section 7.1 that has
a big part of it.",00:48:46.850,00:48:53.350
Ah --,00:48:53.350,00:48:54.680
"I always have one last
thing to say.",00:48:54.680,00:48:58.980
What's the meaning of u?,00:48:58.980,00:49:00.440
"So, u was a Lagrange
multiplier.",00:49:03.180,00:49:06.070
"Lagrange just like helped us out
by saying OK, there was a",00:49:06.070,00:49:09.760
"constraint by using one
of my multipliers.",00:49:09.760,00:49:13.430
"But the point is that
the multiplier",00:49:13.430,00:49:17.140
always has a real meaning.,00:49:17.140,00:49:20.570
I mention prices before.,00:49:20.570,00:49:24.980
"Here, what's the meaning of u?",00:49:24.980,00:49:28.950
"What's the physical meaning of
the Lagrange multiplier.",00:49:28.950,00:49:31.390
"It turns out to be the
displacement of the math.",00:49:31.390,00:49:36.220
"It's the dual variable,
so it always has some",00:49:36.220,00:49:40.040
interpretation.,00:49:40.040,00:49:41.740
"In this case, with mechanics
it's the amount, the mass",00:49:41.740,00:49:46.510
"comes down when the
force asks.",00:49:46.510,00:49:51.810
"What's more, it also has a
derivative interpretation.",00:49:51.810,00:49:57.480
Turns out --,00:49:57.480,00:49:59.210
"I'll just put turns out that
the Lagrange multiplier u",00:49:59.210,00:50:05.040
"turns out to be the derivative
of the minimum energy in the",00:50:05.040,00:50:14.640
"system with respect to
the source term.",00:50:14.640,00:50:20.640
"It's the sensitivity of
the problem somehow.",00:50:20.640,00:50:23.710
I'll just use sensitivity.,00:50:23.710,00:50:27.620
You often want to know --,00:50:27.620,00:50:32.140
"it's actually this quantity
that we need over there.",00:50:32.140,00:50:35.380
"We want to know how much does
the answer depend on the",00:50:35.380,00:50:39.720
"source, and that's what the
Lagrange multiplier tells us.",00:50:39.720,00:50:44.970
"So, if I computed the solution
here, so the notes do this --",00:50:44.970,00:50:51.420
"maybe I'll leave it
for the notes.",00:50:51.420,00:50:53.850
"The notes solve this
little problem.",00:50:53.850,00:50:57.580
That's easy to do.,00:50:57.580,00:50:59.820
"They figure out what the energy
is in the springs.",00:50:59.820,00:51:05.870
"It depends on the right hand
side, f, which is just a",00:51:05.870,00:51:09.800
number here.,00:51:09.800,00:51:12.150
"The energy turns out
to be quadratic.",00:51:12.150,00:51:14.330
"You can take its derivative and
you find out that it's u.",00:51:14.330,00:51:18.830
"So that Lagrange multiplier,
that's really a key message,",00:51:18.830,00:51:25.630
"is an important quantity
in itself.",00:51:25.630,00:51:28.850
"Here it happens to mean
displacement, which is",00:51:28.850,00:51:31.310
"obviously crucial quantity, and
in general it tells us the",00:51:31.310,00:51:36.360
"change in the minimum energy
with respect to a",00:51:36.360,00:51:41.010
change in the input.,00:51:41.010,00:51:44.480
"That sensitivity's a natural
word to use for that.",00:51:44.480,00:51:49.670
"So that's a final word about --
well, a near to final word",00:51:49.670,00:51:52.820
about Lagrange multipliers.,00:51:52.820,00:51:55.000
"So I'll see you Wednesday and
by that time I'll know more",00:51:55.000,00:52:01.140
"about the projects and we'll
be moving onward with",00:52:01.140,00:52:07.450
optimization.,00:52:07.450,00:52:08.650
Good.,00:52:08.650,00:52:08.980
Thanks.,00:52:08.980,00:52:10.230
