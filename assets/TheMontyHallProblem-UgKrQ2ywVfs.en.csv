Hi.,00:00:00.433,00:00:01.300
"In the session, we'll
be solving",00:00:01.300,00:00:02.780
the Monty Hall problem.,00:00:02.780,00:00:04.500
"And this problem is based on
an old game show that was",00:00:04.500,00:00:07.190
"called ""Let's Make a Deal.""
And the host of this game",00:00:07.190,00:00:09.930
"show, his name was Monty Hall,
which is why this problem is",00:00:09.930,00:00:13.170
"now known as the Monty
Hall problem.",00:00:13.170,00:00:15.570
"And this problem is actually
pretty well-known, because",00:00:15.570,00:00:18.840
"there was some disagreement at
the time over what the right",00:00:18.840,00:00:21.450
"answer to this problem
should be.",00:00:21.450,00:00:24.330
"Even some really smart people
didn't agree on what the right",00:00:24.330,00:00:27.800
answer should be.,00:00:27.800,00:00:29.360
"And part of what might explain
that disagreement is that they",00:00:29.360,00:00:36.040
"probably were considering
slightly different variations",00:00:36.040,00:00:38.110
"of the problem, because as in
all probability problems, the",00:00:38.110,00:00:43.220
"assumptions that you're
working with are very",00:00:43.220,00:00:44.930
"important, because otherwise you
may be solving an actually",00:00:44.930,00:00:48.860
different problem.,00:00:48.860,00:00:50.080
"And so what we'll do first is
really layout concretely what",00:00:50.080,00:00:54.480
"all the assumptions are, what
the rules of the game are.",00:00:54.480,00:00:56.760
"And then we'll go through the
methodology to solve for the",00:00:56.760,00:01:00.190
actual answer.,00:01:00.190,00:01:02.350
"So the game is actually
relatively simple.",00:01:02.350,00:01:07.530
"So you're on a game
show and you're",00:01:07.530,00:01:10.820
presented with three doors.,00:01:10.820,00:01:12.490
These doors are closed.,00:01:12.490,00:01:13.720
"And behind one of these doors is
a prize, let's say, a car.",00:01:13.720,00:01:17.940
"And behind the other two
doors, there's nothing.",00:01:17.940,00:01:20.840
"You don't know which
one it is.",00:01:20.840,00:01:22.790
"And the rules of the game are
that, first, you get to choose",00:01:22.790,00:01:26.170
any one of these three.,00:01:26.170,00:01:27.800
"So you pick one of the
doors that you want.",00:01:27.800,00:01:31.820
"They don't show you what's
behind that door, but your",00:01:31.820,00:01:35.620
"friend, who actually knows
which door has the prize",00:01:35.620,00:01:38.890
"behind it, will look at
the remaining doors.",00:01:38.890,00:01:41.630
"So let's, just for example,
let's say you chose door one.",00:01:41.630,00:01:45.640
"Your friend will look at
the other two doors",00:01:45.640,00:01:48.900
and open one of them.,00:01:48.900,00:01:51.240
"And you will make sure
that the one",00:01:51.240,00:01:53.370
that he opens is empty.,00:01:53.370,00:01:54.950
"That is the prize not
behind that one.",00:01:54.950,00:01:57.390
"And at this point, one of the
doors is open and its empty,",00:01:57.390,00:02:01.810
"you have your original door plus
another unopened door.",00:02:01.810,00:02:05.130
"And you're given an option--
you could either stay with",00:02:05.130,00:02:07.360
"your initial choice or
you can switch to the",00:02:07.360,00:02:10.789
other unopened door.,00:02:10.789,00:02:12.150
"And whichever one is your
final choice, they",00:02:12.150,00:02:14.780
will open that door.,00:02:14.780,00:02:15.830
"And if there's a price behind
it, you win, and if there not,",00:02:15.830,00:02:18.830
then you don't win.,00:02:18.830,00:02:20.890
"So the question that we're
trying to answer is what is",00:02:20.890,00:02:23.630
the better strategy here?,00:02:23.630,00:02:25.290
"Is the better strategy to stay
with your initial choice or is",00:02:25.290,00:02:29.790
"it better to switch to the
other unopened door?",00:02:29.790,00:02:33.910
"OK, so it turns out that the
specific rules here actually",00:02:33.910,00:02:38.360
are very important.,00:02:38.360,00:02:39.600
"Specifically, the rule about
how your friend chooses to",00:02:39.600,00:02:43.010
open doors.,00:02:43.010,00:02:43.750
"And the fact that he will always
open one of the two",00:02:43.750,00:02:47.460
"other door that you haven't
picked and he will make sure",00:02:47.460,00:02:49.650
"that that door doesn't have
a prize behind it.",00:02:49.650,00:02:53.000
And let's see how that actually,00:02:53.000,00:02:54.930
plays out in this problem.,00:02:54.930,00:02:56.890
"So the simplest way, I think, of
thinking about this problem",00:02:56.890,00:03:00.880
"is just to think about under
what circumstances does",00:03:00.880,00:03:05.050
"staying with your initial
choice win?",00:03:05.050,00:03:07.900
"So if you think about it, the
only way that you can win by",00:03:07.900,00:03:11.380
"staying with your initial choice
is if your initial",00:03:11.380,00:03:13.450
"choice happened to be the door
that has a prize behind it.",00:03:13.450,00:03:17.270
"And because you're sticking with
the initial choice, you",00:03:17.270,00:03:20.820
"can actually kind of forget
about the rest of the game,",00:03:20.820,00:03:23.000
"about opening of the other
door and about switching.",00:03:23.000,00:03:26.310
"It's as if you're playing a
simpler game, which is just",00:03:26.310,00:03:28.650
"you have three doors, one of
them has a prize behind it,",00:03:28.650,00:03:33.340
and you choose one of them.,00:03:33.340,00:03:35.480
"And if you guessed right,
then you win.",00:03:35.480,00:03:37.340
"If you didn't, then
you don't win.",00:03:37.340,00:03:40.440
"And because the another
important assumption is that",00:03:40.440,00:03:43.360
"the prize has an equal
probability of being behind",00:03:43.360,00:03:46.020
"any one of three doors so one
third, one third, one third.",00:03:46.020,00:03:49.500
"Because of that, then if you
stay with your first choice,",00:03:49.500,00:03:53.690
"you win only if your first
choice happened",00:03:53.690,00:03:55.980
to the right one.,00:03:55.980,00:03:56.740
"And that is the case with
probably one third.",00:03:56.740,00:03:59.800
"So with that simple argument you
can convince yourself that",00:03:59.800,00:04:04.980
"the probability of winning,
given the strategy of staying",00:04:04.980,00:04:08.400
"with your first choice,
is one third.",00:04:08.400,00:04:10.990
"Now, let's think
about the other",00:04:10.990,00:04:12.050
"strategy, which is to switch.",00:04:12.050,00:04:13.960
"So under what circumstances does
switching win for you?",00:04:13.960,00:04:18.390
"Well, if your first choice
happened to be the right door,",00:04:18.390,00:04:23.760
"then switching away from that
door will always lose.",00:04:23.760,00:04:29.740
"But let's say, that happens
with probably one third.",00:04:29.740,00:04:34.670
"But the rest of the time with
probably 2/3, your first",00:04:34.670,00:04:37.920
choice would be wrong.,00:04:37.920,00:04:39.260
So let's give an example here.,00:04:39.260,00:04:41.250
"Let's say, the prize, which I'll
denote by happy face, is",00:04:41.250,00:04:44.635
behind door two.,00:04:44.635,00:04:45.870
"And your first choice
was door one.",00:04:45.870,00:04:48.090
"So your first choice
was wrong.",00:04:48.090,00:04:50.390
"Now, your friend can open door
two, because door two has the",00:04:50.390,00:04:53.730
prize behind it.,00:04:53.730,00:04:54.650
"He also doesn't open the door
that you initially picked.",00:04:54.650,00:04:57.540
So he has to open door three.,00:04:57.540,00:04:59.930
"So door three is open, and now
you have an option of sticking",00:04:59.930,00:05:02.110
"with your first choice--
door one--",00:05:02.110,00:05:03.520
or switching to door two.,00:05:03.520,00:05:05.330
"So in this case, it's
obvious to see that",00:05:05.330,00:05:07.030
switching wins for you.,00:05:07.030,00:05:09.300
"And now, if instead, you picked
door one first, and the",00:05:09.300,00:05:15.020
"prize was behind door three,
again, you are wrong.",00:05:15.020,00:05:19.300
"And again, your friend is
forced to open door two.",00:05:19.300,00:05:22.120
"And switching, again,
wins for you.",00:05:22.120,00:05:24.530
"And so if you think about it,
switching will win for you, as",00:05:24.530,00:05:29.530
"long as your initial
pick was wrong.",00:05:29.530,00:05:32.560
"If your initial pick was wrong,
then the prize is",00:05:32.560,00:05:36.610
behind one of the doors.,00:05:36.610,00:05:38.540
"Your friend has to open one of
the doors, but he can't open",00:05:38.540,00:05:41.050
"the door that has the
prize behind it.",00:05:41.050,00:05:42.820
"So he has to open the other
bad door, leaving the good",00:05:42.820,00:05:48.030
"door with the prize behind
it, as the one that",00:05:48.030,00:05:49.490
you can switch to.,00:05:49.490,00:05:50.810
"And so by switching you will
win in this scenario.",00:05:50.810,00:05:54.020
"And what is the probability
of that happening?",00:05:54.020,00:05:55.730
"Well, that happens if your
initial pick was wrong, which",00:05:55.730,00:06:00.160
happens with probably 2/3.,00:06:00.160,00:06:03.110
"So the final answer then, it's
pretty simple, the probability",00:06:03.110,00:06:06.520
"of winning if you stay is one
third, and the probability of",00:06:06.520,00:06:09.526
winning if you switch is 2/3.,00:06:09.526,00:06:11.560
"And so maybe counterintuitively
the result",00:06:11.560,00:06:15.130
"is that it's actually better
for you, twice as good for",00:06:15.130,00:06:17.500
"you, to switch rather
than stay.",00:06:17.500,00:06:21.500
"And so that was the argument,
the kind of simple argument.",00:06:21.500,00:06:26.930
"We can also be more methodical
about this and actually list",00:06:26.930,00:06:29.630
"out all of the possible
outcomes.",00:06:29.630,00:06:31.020
"Because it's relatively small
problem-- there's only three",00:06:31.020,00:06:33.290
"doors-- we can actually
just list out all",00:06:33.290,00:06:35.050
the possible outcomes.,00:06:35.050,00:06:36.230
"So for example, if you chose
door one first, and the prize",00:06:36.230,00:06:40.000
"was behind door one, your
friend has a choice.",00:06:40.000,00:06:42.570
"He can open door two or
door three, because",00:06:42.570,00:06:44.870
they're both empty.,00:06:44.870,00:06:46.740
"And then in that case, if you
stay, you win, you picked the",00:06:46.740,00:06:50.440
door correctly.,00:06:50.440,00:06:51.250
"And if you switch to two or
three, then you lose.",00:06:51.250,00:06:54.940
"But if you chose door one, the
prize is behind door two, then",00:06:54.940,00:06:58.400
"your friend has to open door
three, he is forced to do",00:06:58.400,00:07:00.580
"that, then staying with lose
but switching would win.",00:07:00.580,00:07:03.510
And so on for the other cases.,00:07:03.510,00:07:06.320
"And so again, this is just an
exhaustive list of all the",00:07:06.320,00:07:13.920
"possible outcomes, from which
you can see that, in fact,",00:07:13.920,00:07:17.020
"staying wins, only if your
first choice was correct.",00:07:17.020,00:07:22.520
"And switching wins in
all the other cases.",00:07:22.520,00:07:24.850
"And so one third of the time,
staying would win, 2/3 of the",00:07:24.850,00:07:28.780
time switching would win.,00:07:28.780,00:07:31.070
"OK, so now, we have
the answer.",00:07:31.070,00:07:35.210
"Let's try to figure out and
convince ourselves that it is",00:07:35.210,00:07:37.880
"actually right, because you
might think before going",00:07:37.880,00:07:40.780
"through this process that
maybe it doesn't matter",00:07:40.780,00:07:44.870
"whether you stay or you switch,
they both have the",00:07:44.870,00:07:46.410
"same probably of winning, or
maybe even staying is better.",00:07:46.410,00:07:49.910
"So why is staying worse
and switching better?",00:07:49.910,00:07:52.950
"Well, the first argument really
is something that we've",00:07:52.950,00:07:56.790
already talked about.,00:07:56.790,00:07:58.430
"By staying, you're essentially
banking on your first choice",00:07:58.430,00:08:02.750
"being correct, which is a
relatively poor bet, because",00:08:02.750,00:08:06.390
"you have only one in three
chance of being right.",00:08:06.390,00:08:09.350
"But by switching, you're
actually banking on your first",00:08:09.350,00:08:13.340
"choice being wrong, which is a
relatively better bet, because",00:08:13.340,00:08:17.600
"you're more likely to be wrong
than right in your first",00:08:17.600,00:08:20.100
"choice, because you're
just picking blindly.",00:08:20.100,00:08:22.580
"OK, so that is one intuitive
explanation for why",00:08:22.580,00:08:27.120
switching is better.,00:08:27.120,00:08:29.620
"Another slightly different way
to think about it is that",00:08:29.620,00:08:34.320
"instead of picking single doors,
you're actually picking",00:08:34.320,00:08:39.960
groups of doors.,00:08:39.960,00:08:41.770
"So let's say that your first
pick was door one.",00:08:41.770,00:08:44.780
"Then you're actually really
deciding between door one or",00:08:44.780,00:08:49.510
doors two and three combined.,00:08:49.510,00:08:52.120
So why is that?,00:08:52.120,00:08:53.365
"It's because by staying
with door one, you're",00:08:53.365,00:08:56.560
staying with door one.,00:08:56.560,00:08:57.950
"But by switching, you're
actually getting two doors for",00:08:57.950,00:09:02.360
"the price of one, because you
know that your friend will",00:09:02.360,00:09:07.460
"reveal one of these to be empty,
and the other one will",00:09:07.460,00:09:11.170
stay closed.,00:09:11.170,00:09:11.950
"But switching really kind of
buys you both of these.",00:09:11.950,00:09:16.010
"And so because it buys you two
opportunities to win, you get",00:09:16.010,00:09:21.640
"2/3 chance of winning, versus
a one third chance.",00:09:21.640,00:09:24.210
 ,00:09:24.210,00:09:26.930
"Another way of thinking about
this is to increase the scale",00:09:26.930,00:09:30.920
"of the problem, and maybe that
will help visualize the",00:09:30.920,00:09:37.570
counterintuitive answer.,00:09:37.570,00:09:39.890
"So instead of having three
doors, imagine that you have",00:09:39.890,00:09:42.710
"1,000 doors that are closed.",00:09:42.710,00:09:45.890
"And again, one prize is behind
one of the doors.",00:09:45.890,00:09:51.230
"And the rules are similar-- you
pick one door first, and",00:09:51.230,00:09:55.510
"then your friend will open
998 other doors.",00:09:55.510,00:09:59.720
"And these doors are guaranteed
to be empty.",00:09:59.720,00:10:02.370
"And now you're left with your
initial door plus one other",00:10:02.370,00:10:05.450
door that is unopened.,00:10:05.450,00:10:07.140
"So now the question is should
you stay with your first",00:10:07.140,00:10:09.590
"choice or switch to
your other choice?",00:10:09.590,00:10:14.540
"And it should be more
intuitively obvious now that",00:10:14.540,00:10:18.940
"the better decision would be
to switch, because you're",00:10:18.940,00:10:21.890
"overwhelmingly more likely to
have picked incorrectly for",00:10:21.890,00:10:27.450
your first pick.,00:10:27.450,00:10:28.250
"You have only 1 in 1,000 chance
of getting it right.",00:10:28.250,00:10:31.000
"So that is kind of just taking
this to a bigger extreme and",00:10:31.000,00:10:36.240
"really driving home
the intuition.",00:10:36.240,00:10:40.020
"OK, so what we've really
discovered is that the fact",00:10:40.020,00:10:50.110
"that the rules of the game are
that your friend has to open",00:10:50.110,00:10:53.430
"one of the other two doors and
cannot reveal the prize plays",00:10:53.430,00:10:57.840
a big role in this problem.,00:10:57.840,00:10:59.580
"And that is an important
assumption.",00:10:59.580,00:11:01.770
"OK, so now let's think
about a slightly",00:11:01.770,00:11:04.720
different variation now.,00:11:04.720,00:11:05.980
So a different strategy.,00:11:05.980,00:11:06.990
"Instead of just always staying
or always switching, we have a",00:11:06.990,00:11:10.550
"specific other strategy, which
is that you will choose door",00:11:10.550,00:11:15.540
"one first and then, depending on
what your friend does, you",00:11:15.540,00:11:19.550
will act accordingly.,00:11:19.550,00:11:21.680
"So if your friend opens door
two, you will not switch.",00:11:21.680,00:11:25.620
"And if your friend opens door
three, you will switch.",00:11:25.620,00:11:28.130
"So let's draw out exactly
what happens here.",00:11:28.130,00:11:33.150
"So you have door one
that you've chosen.",00:11:33.150,00:11:35.160
 ,00:11:35.160,00:11:37.980
"And the prize can be behind
doors one, two, or three.",00:11:37.980,00:11:42.780
"And again, it's equally
likely.",00:11:42.780,00:11:44.590
"So the probabilities of these
branches are one third, one",00:11:44.590,00:11:47.450
"third, and one third.",00:11:47.450,00:11:50.220
"And now given that, your friend
in this scenario has a",00:11:50.220,00:11:57.970
"choice between opening
doors two or three.",00:11:57.970,00:12:00.130
"And so because of doors, you
chose one, the prize actually",00:12:00.130,00:12:03.510
"is behind one, and so two and
three are both empty, so he",00:12:03.510,00:12:06.400
"can choose whichever one
he wants to open.",00:12:06.400,00:12:08.030
 ,00:12:08.030,00:12:11.380
"And the problem actually hasn't
specified how your",00:12:11.380,00:12:15.490
"friend actually decides
between this.",00:12:15.490,00:12:16.660
So we'll leave it in general.,00:12:16.660,00:12:21.310
"So we'll say that the
probability p, your friend",00:12:21.310,00:12:24.720
"will open two, door
two, in this case.",00:12:24.720,00:12:26.670
"And with the remaining
probability 1 minus p, he will",00:12:26.670,00:12:31.480
open door three.,00:12:31.480,00:12:33.270
What about in this case?,00:12:33.270,00:12:34.340
"Well, you chose door one.",00:12:34.340,00:12:35.760
"The prize is actually
behind door two.",00:12:35.760,00:12:37.490
"So following the rules of the
game, your friend is forced to",00:12:37.490,00:12:40.010
open door three.,00:12:40.010,00:12:40.920
"So this happens with
probability 1.",00:12:40.920,00:12:43.530
"And similarly, if the prize is
behind door three, your friend",00:12:43.530,00:12:46.710
"is forced to open door two,
which, again, happens with",00:12:46.710,00:12:48.890
probably 1.,00:12:48.890,00:12:50.460
"So now let's see how this
strategy works.",00:12:50.460,00:12:53.860
When do you win?,00:12:53.860,00:12:55.300
"You win when, according to the
strategy, your final choice is",00:12:55.300,00:13:02.300
the right door.,00:13:02.300,00:13:02.900
"So according to the strategy,
in this case, your friend",00:13:02.900,00:13:06.160
opened door two.,00:13:06.160,00:13:07.650
"And according to your strategy,
if door two is open,",00:13:07.650,00:13:10.560
you don't switch.,00:13:10.560,00:13:11.330
"So you stay with your
first choice of one.",00:13:11.330,00:13:13.660
"And that happens to the right
one, so you win in this case.",00:13:13.660,00:13:17.380
But what about here?,00:13:17.380,00:13:18.500
"Your friend opened door three,
and by your strategy, you do",00:13:18.500,00:13:22.110
"switch, which is the wrong
choice here, so you lose.",00:13:22.110,00:13:26.080
"Here, you switch, because you
open door three, and you",00:13:26.080,00:13:28.750
"switch to the right door,
so that wins.",00:13:28.750,00:13:31.460
"And this one, you don't
switch, and you lose.",00:13:31.460,00:13:34.910
"All right, so what is the final
probability of winning?",00:13:34.910,00:13:39.110
"And the final probably of
winning is the probability of",00:13:39.110,00:13:42.130
"getting to these two outcomes,
which happens with probability",00:13:42.130,00:13:45.730
"one third times p plus
one third times 1.",00:13:45.730,00:13:52.510
So one third.,00:13:52.510,00:13:53.670
"So the final answer is one
third p plus one third.",00:13:53.670,00:13:57.010
"And notice now that the answer
isn't just a number.",00:13:57.010,00:14:00.520
"Like in this case, the answer
was one third and 2/3.",00:14:00.520,00:14:04.400
"And it didn't actually matter
how your friend chose between",00:14:04.400,00:14:07.930
"these two doors when
he had a choice.",00:14:07.930,00:14:10.220
"But in this case, it actually
doesn't matter, because p",00:14:10.220,00:14:12.680
stays in the answer.,00:14:12.680,00:14:14.090
"But one thing that we can do
is we can compare this with",00:14:14.090,00:14:17.420
these strategies.,00:14:17.420,00:14:18.780
"So what we see is that, well p
is a probability, so it has to",00:14:18.780,00:14:22.545
be between 0 and 1.,00:14:22.545,00:14:23.920
"So this probability winning for
this strategy is somewhere",00:14:23.920,00:14:27.000
"between one third times 0 plus
one third, which is one third.",00:14:27.000,00:14:31.130
"And one third times 1 plus
one third, which is 2/3.",00:14:31.130,00:14:33.460
"So the strategy is somewhere
between 2/3 and one third.",00:14:33.460,00:14:38.530
"So what we see is that no matter
what, this strategy is",00:14:38.530,00:14:43.560
"at least as good as staying all
the time, because that was",00:14:43.560,00:14:46.200
only one third.,00:14:46.200,00:14:47.060
"And no matter what it can't be
any better than switching,",00:14:47.060,00:14:51.610
which was 2/3.,00:14:51.610,00:14:53.850
"So you can also come up with
lots of other different",00:14:53.850,00:14:56.850
"strategies and see what the
probabilities of winning are",00:14:56.850,00:15:00.970
in that case.,00:15:00.970,00:15:02.580
"OK, so what have we learned
in this problem?",00:15:02.580,00:15:05.100
What are the key takeaways?,00:15:05.100,00:15:06.380
"One important takeaway is that
it's important to really",00:15:06.380,00:15:10.680
"understand a problem and arrive
at a concrete and",00:15:10.680,00:15:13.500
precise set of assumptions.,00:15:13.500,00:15:15.530
"So really have a precise problem
that you're solving.",00:15:15.530,00:15:19.070
"And another important takeaway
is to think about your final",00:15:19.070,00:15:24.460
"answer, make sure that that
actually makes sense to you,",00:15:24.460,00:15:27.230
"make sure that you can justify
it somehow intuitively.",00:15:27.230,00:15:30.740
"In that case, you can actually
convince yourself that your",00:15:30.740,00:15:35.030
"answer is actually correct,
because sometimes go through a",00:15:35.030,00:15:37.890
"lot of formulas, and sometimes
your formula may have an error",00:15:37.890,00:15:41.660
in there somewhere.,00:15:41.660,00:15:43.040
"But you could take the final
answer and ask yourself does",00:15:43.040,00:15:45.040
"this actually makes
sense intuitively?",00:15:45.040,00:15:48.100
"That's often a very good check
and sometimes you can catch",00:15:48.100,00:15:52.250
"errors in your calculations
that way.",00:15:52.250,00:15:55.400
OK so we'll see next time.,00:15:55.400,00:15:57.160
 ,00:15:57.160,00:16:03.000
