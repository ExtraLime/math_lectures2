"PROFESSOR: OK, good morning.",00:00:22.420,00:00:25.310
"So today, we're going to have
a fairly packed lecture.",00:00:25.310,00:00:30.930
"We are going to conclude
with chapter two,",00:00:30.930,00:00:34.060
discrete random variables.,00:00:34.060,00:00:35.560
"And we will be talking
mostly about",00:00:35.560,00:00:37.140
multiple random variables.,00:00:37.140,00:00:39.322
"And this is also the
last lecture as far",00:00:39.322,00:00:43.060
as quiz one is concerned.,00:00:43.060,00:00:44.720
"So it's going to cover the
material until today, and of",00:00:44.720,00:00:48.350
"course the next recitation
and tutorial as well.",00:00:48.350,00:00:52.550
"OK, so we're going to review
quickly what we introduced at",00:00:52.550,00:00:57.170
"the end of last lecture, where
we talked about the joint PMF",00:00:57.170,00:01:01.040
of two random variables.,00:01:01.040,00:01:02.300
"We're going to talk about the
case of more than two random",00:01:02.300,00:01:05.040
variables as well.,00:01:05.040,00:01:07.440
"We're going to talk about
the familiar concepts of",00:01:07.440,00:01:09.910
"conditioning and independence,
but applied to random",00:01:09.910,00:01:14.300
variables instead of events.,00:01:14.300,00:01:16.460
"We're going to look at the
expectations once more, talk",00:01:16.460,00:01:19.320
"about a few properties that they
have, and then solve a",00:01:19.320,00:01:22.720
"couple of problems and calculate
a few things in",00:01:22.720,00:01:25.900
somewhat clever ways.,00:01:25.900,00:01:28.180
"So the first point I want to
make is that, to a large",00:01:28.180,00:01:31.790
"extent, whatever is happening
in our chapter on discrete",00:01:31.790,00:01:34.870
"random variables is just an
exercise in notation.",00:01:34.870,00:01:39.160
"There is stuff and concepts that
you are already familiar",00:01:39.160,00:01:42.850
"with-- probabilities,
probabilities of two things",00:01:42.850,00:01:45.230
"happening, conditional
probabilities.",00:01:45.230,00:01:47.490
"And all that we're doing, to
some extent, is rewriting",00:01:47.490,00:01:51.760
"those familiar concepts
in new notation.",00:01:51.760,00:01:54.840
"So for example, this
is the joint PMF",00:01:54.840,00:01:57.810
of two random variable.,00:01:57.810,00:01:59.020
"It gives us, for any pair or
possible values of those",00:01:59.020,00:02:02.080
"random variables, the
probability that that pair",00:02:02.080,00:02:05.510
occurs simultaneously.,00:02:05.510,00:02:07.270
"So it's the probability that
simultaneously x takes that",00:02:07.270,00:02:10.020
"value, and y takes
that other value.",00:02:10.020,00:02:13.580
"And similarly, we have the
notion of the conditional PMF,",00:02:13.580,00:02:17.210
"which is just a list of the --
condition of -- the various",00:02:17.210,00:02:21.060
"conditional probabilities
of interest, conditional",00:02:21.060,00:02:23.750
"probability that one random
variable takes this value",00:02:23.750,00:02:26.450
"given that the other random
variable takes that value.",00:02:26.450,00:02:30.320
"Now, a remark about conditional
probabilities.",00:02:30.320,00:02:33.640
"Conditional probabilities
generally are like ordinary",00:02:33.640,00:02:36.640
probabilities.,00:02:36.640,00:02:37.370
"You condition on something
particular.",00:02:37.370,00:02:40.170
"So here we condition
on a particular y.",00:02:40.170,00:02:43.230
"So think of little y as
a fixed quantity.",00:02:43.230,00:02:46.580
"And then look at this
as a function of x.",00:02:46.580,00:02:49.800
"So given that y, which we
condition on, given our new",00:02:49.800,00:02:54.430
"universe, we're considering the
various possibilities for",00:02:54.430,00:02:58.990
"x and the probabilities
that they have.",00:02:58.990,00:03:01.290
"Now, the probabilities over
all x's, of course,",00:03:01.290,00:03:04.000
needs to add to 1.,00:03:04.000,00:03:05.830
"So we should have a relation
of this kind.",00:03:05.830,00:03:11.530
"So they're just like ordinary
probabilities over the",00:03:11.530,00:03:14.420
"different x's in a universe
where we are told the value of",00:03:14.420,00:03:18.230
the random variable y.,00:03:18.230,00:03:20.940
"Now, how are these related?",00:03:20.940,00:03:22.335
"So we call these the marginal,
these the joint, these the",00:03:25.200,00:03:28.190
conditional.,00:03:28.190,00:03:29.150
"And there are some relations
between these.",00:03:29.150,00:03:31.510
"For example, to find the
marginal from the joint, it's",00:03:31.510,00:03:35.430
pretty straightforward.,00:03:35.430,00:03:37.730
"The probability that x takes a
particular value is the sum of",00:03:37.730,00:03:41.680
"the probabilities of all of the
different ways that this",00:03:41.680,00:03:45.030
particular value may occur.,00:03:45.030,00:03:47.190
What are the different ways?,00:03:47.190,00:03:48.380
"Well, it may occur together with
a certain y, or together",00:03:48.380,00:03:51.910
"with some other y, or together
with some other y.",00:03:51.910,00:03:55.110
"So you look at all the possible
y's that can go",00:03:55.110,00:03:58.030
"together with this x, and add
the probabilities of all of",00:03:58.030,00:04:01.750
"those pairs for which we get
this particular value of x.",00:04:01.750,00:04:07.220
"And then there's a relation
between that connects these",00:04:07.220,00:04:13.120
"two probabilities with the
conditional probability.",00:04:13.120,00:04:16.230
And it's this relation.,00:04:16.230,00:04:18.630
It's nothing new.,00:04:18.630,00:04:20.279
"It's just new notation for
writing what we already know,",00:04:20.279,00:04:25.160
"that the probability of two
things happening is the",00:04:25.160,00:04:28.130
"probability that the first thing
happens, and then given",00:04:28.130,00:04:31.460
"that the first thing happens,
the probability that the",00:04:31.460,00:04:34.210
second one happened.,00:04:34.210,00:04:36.140
"So how do we go from
one to the other?",00:04:36.140,00:04:39.050
"Think of A as being the event
that X takes the value, little",00:04:39.050,00:04:42.960
"x, and B being the event that
Y takes the value, little y.",00:04:42.960,00:04:49.120
"So the joint probability is the
probability that these two",00:04:49.120,00:04:52.230
things happen simultaneously.,00:04:52.230,00:04:54.220
"It's the probability that X
takes this value times the",00:04:54.220,00:04:58.140
"conditional probability that Y
takes this value, given that X",00:04:58.140,00:05:03.280
took that first value.,00:05:03.280,00:05:04.670
"So it's the familiar
multiplication rule, but just",00:05:04.670,00:05:08.470
"transcribed in our
new notation.",00:05:08.470,00:05:11.030
So nothing new so far.,00:05:11.030,00:05:13.690
"OK, why did we go through this
exercise and this notation?",00:05:13.690,00:05:17.480
"It's because in the experiments
where we're",00:05:17.480,00:05:19.980
"interested in the real world,
typically there's going to be",00:05:19.980,00:05:23.160
lots of uncertain quantities.,00:05:23.160,00:05:24.630
"There's going to be multiple
random variables.",00:05:24.630,00:05:27.150
"And we want to be able to talk
about them simultaneously.",00:05:27.150,00:05:31.520
Okay.,00:05:31.520,00:05:31.665
Why two and not more than two?,00:05:31.665,00:05:35.110
"How about three random
variables?",00:05:35.110,00:05:37.620
"Well, if you understand what's
going on in this slide, you",00:05:37.620,00:05:41.290
"should be able to kind of
automatically generalize this",00:05:41.290,00:05:45.720
"to the case of multiple
random variables.",00:05:45.720,00:05:48.260
"So for example, if we have three
random variables, X, Y,",00:05:48.260,00:05:51.590
"and Z, and you see an expression
like this, it",00:05:51.590,00:05:56.720
should be clear what it means.,00:05:56.720,00:05:58.670
"It's the probability that
X takes this value and",00:05:58.670,00:06:02.070
"simultaneously Y takes that
value and simultaneously Z",00:06:02.070,00:06:06.240
takes that value.,00:06:06.240,00:06:07.765
"I guess that's an uppercase Z
here, that's a lowercase z.",00:06:07.765,00:06:13.280
"And if I ask you to find the
marginal of X, if I tell you",00:06:13.280,00:06:20.500
"the joint PMF of the three
random variables and I ask you",00:06:20.500,00:06:24.340
"for this value, how
would you find it?",00:06:24.340,00:06:27.320
"Well, you will try to generalize
this relation here.",00:06:27.320,00:06:31.350
"The probability that x occurs
is the sum of the",00:06:31.350,00:06:35.250
"probabilities of all events
that make X to take that",00:06:35.250,00:06:44.450
particular value.,00:06:44.450,00:06:45.870
So what are all the events?,00:06:45.870,00:06:47.400
"Well, this particular x can
happen together with some y",00:06:47.400,00:06:51.530
and some z.,00:06:51.530,00:06:52.790
We don't care which y and z.,00:06:52.790,00:06:55.150
Any y and z will do.,00:06:55.150,00:06:57.890
"So when we consider all
possibilities, we need to add",00:06:57.890,00:07:01.220
"here over all possible values
of y's and z's.",00:07:01.220,00:07:04.760
"So consider all triples,
x, y, z.",00:07:04.760,00:07:08.020
"Fix x and consider all the
possibilities for the",00:07:08.020,00:07:12.380
"remaining variables, y and z,
add these up, and that gives",00:07:12.380,00:07:16.600
"you the marginal PMF of X. And
then there's other things that",00:07:16.600,00:07:24.740
you can do.,00:07:24.740,00:07:26.140
"This is the multiplication
rule for two events.",00:07:26.140,00:07:29.340
"We saw back in chapter one that
there's a multiplication",00:07:29.340,00:07:32.510
"rule when you talk about
more than two events.",00:07:32.510,00:07:35.130
"And you can write a chain of
conditional probabilities.",00:07:35.130,00:07:38.860
"We can certainly do the same
in our new notation.",00:07:38.860,00:07:43.860
"So let's look at this
rule up here.",00:07:43.860,00:07:45.810
"Multiplication rule for three
random variables,",00:07:48.700,00:07:51.220
what does it say?,00:07:51.220,00:07:53.000
"The probability of three
things happening",00:07:53.000,00:07:55.280
"simultaneously, X, Y, Z taking
specific values, little x,",00:07:55.280,00:07:59.770
"little y, little z, that
probability is the probability",00:07:59.770,00:08:03.110
"that the first thing happens,
that X takes that value.",00:08:03.110,00:08:07.210
"Given that X takes that value,
we multiply it with the",00:08:07.210,00:08:09.880
"probability that Y takes
also a certain value.",00:08:09.880,00:08:14.650
"And now, given that X and Y have
taken those particular",00:08:14.650,00:08:18.560
"values, we multiply with a
conditional probability that",00:08:18.560,00:08:21.730
"the third thing happens,
given that the",00:08:21.730,00:08:24.380
first two things happen.,00:08:24.380,00:08:26.960
"So this is just the
multiplication rule for three",00:08:26.960,00:08:30.080
"events, which would be
probability of A intersection",00:08:30.080,00:08:33.530
B intersection C equals--,00:08:33.530,00:08:35.669
"you know the rest
of the formula.",00:08:35.669,00:08:37.909
"You just rewrite this formula
in PMF notation.",00:08:37.909,00:08:42.330
"Probability of A intersection
B intersection C is the",00:08:42.330,00:08:45.310
"probability of A, which
corresponds to this term,",00:08:45.310,00:08:49.450
"times the probability of B given
A, times the probability",00:08:49.450,00:08:54.010
of C given A and B.,00:08:54.010,00:09:00.700
"So what else is there that's
left from chapter one that we",00:09:00.700,00:09:04.920
"can or should generalize
to random variables?",00:09:04.920,00:09:10.190
"Well, there's the notion
of independence.",00:09:10.190,00:09:12.560
"So let's define what
independence means.",00:09:12.560,00:09:16.720
"Instead of talking about just
two random variables, let's go",00:09:16.720,00:09:19.970
"directly to the case of multiple
random variables.",00:09:19.970,00:09:22.470
"When we talked about events,
things were a little",00:09:22.470,00:09:24.400
complicated.,00:09:24.400,00:09:25.100
"We had a simple definition for
independence of two events.",00:09:25.100,00:09:28.480
"Two events are independent if
the probability of both is",00:09:28.480,00:09:31.950
"equal to the product of
the probabilities.",00:09:31.950,00:09:33.740
"But for three events, it
was kind of messy.",00:09:33.740,00:09:35.830
"We needed to write down
lots of conditions.",00:09:35.830,00:09:38.460
"For random variables,
things in some sense",00:09:38.460,00:09:41.140
are a little simpler.,00:09:41.140,00:09:42.060
"We only need to write down one
formula and take this as the",00:09:42.060,00:09:46.360
definition of independence.,00:09:46.360,00:09:49.020
"Three random variables are
independent if and only if, by",00:09:49.020,00:09:53.630
"definition, their joint
probability mass function",00:09:53.630,00:09:58.390
"factors out into individual
probability mass functions.",00:09:58.390,00:10:02.560
"So the probability that all
three things happen is the",00:10:02.560,00:10:08.190
"product of the individual
probabilities that each one of",00:10:08.190,00:10:11.840
"these three things
is happening.",00:10:11.840,00:10:14.170
"So independence means
mathematically that you can",00:10:14.170,00:10:17.580
"just multiply probabilities to
get to the probability of",00:10:17.580,00:10:21.030
"several things happening
simultaneously.",00:10:21.030,00:10:22.706
"So with three events, we have
to write a huge number of",00:10:25.680,00:10:31.040
"equations, of equalities
that have to hold.",00:10:31.040,00:10:34.500
"How can it be that with random
variables we can only manage",00:10:34.500,00:10:37.500
with one equality?,00:10:37.500,00:10:39.370
"Well, the catch is
that this is not",00:10:39.370,00:10:41.230
really just one equality.,00:10:41.230,00:10:43.260
"We require this to be true for
every little x, y, and z.",00:10:43.260,00:10:48.390
"So in some sense, this is a
bunch of conditions that are",00:10:48.390,00:10:52.600
"being put on the joint PMF, a
bunch of conditions that we",00:10:52.600,00:10:56.300
need to check.,00:10:56.300,00:10:58.130
"So this is the mathematical
definition.",00:10:58.130,00:11:01.040
"What is the intuitive content
of this definition?",00:11:01.040,00:11:05.400
"The intuitive content is
the same as for events.",00:11:05.400,00:11:11.130
"Random variables are independent
if knowing",00:11:11.130,00:11:15.020
"something about the realized
values of some of these random",00:11:15.020,00:11:19.490
"variables does not change our
beliefs about the likelihood",00:11:19.490,00:11:25.510
"of various values for the
remaining random variables.",00:11:25.510,00:11:29.510
"So independence would translate,
for example, to a",00:11:29.510,00:11:34.250
"condition such as the
conditional PMF of X , given",00:11:34.250,00:11:39.690
"y, should be equal to the
marginal PMF of X. What is",00:11:39.690,00:11:46.420
this saying?,00:11:46.420,00:11:47.490
"That you have some original
beliefs about how likely it is",00:11:47.490,00:11:53.070
for X to take this value.,00:11:53.070,00:11:55.210
"Now, someone comes and
tells you that Y took",00:11:55.210,00:11:58.350
on a certain value.,00:11:58.350,00:12:00.140
"This causes you, in principle,
to revise your beliefs.",00:12:00.140,00:12:03.470
"And your new beliefs will be
captured by the conditional",00:12:03.470,00:12:06.430
"PMF, or the conditional
probabilities.",00:12:06.430,00:12:08.750
"Independence means that your
revised beliefs actually will",00:12:08.750,00:12:12.820
"be the same as your
original beliefs.",00:12:12.820,00:12:15.420
"Telling you information about
the value of Y doesn't change",00:12:15.420,00:12:19.960
"what you expect for the
random variable X.",00:12:19.960,00:12:24.400
"Why didn't we use this
definition for independence?",00:12:24.400,00:12:28.750
"Well, because this definition
only makes sense when this",00:12:28.750,00:12:31.900
conditional is well-defined.,00:12:31.900,00:12:34.330
"And this conditional is only
well-defined if the events",00:12:34.330,00:12:43.290
"that Y takes on that particular
value has positive",00:12:43.290,00:12:46.130
probability.,00:12:46.130,00:12:47.220
"We cannot condition on events
that have zero probability, so",00:12:47.220,00:12:51.730
"conditional probabilities are
only defined for y's that are",00:12:51.730,00:12:55.460
"likely to occur, that have
a positive probability.",00:12:55.460,00:12:59.500
"Now, similarly, with multiple
random variables, if they're",00:12:59.500,00:13:03.640
"independent, you would have
relations such as the",00:13:03.640,00:13:07.970
"conditional of X, given y and
z, should be the same as the",00:13:07.970,00:13:14.290
"marginal of X. What
is this saying?",00:13:14.290,00:13:17.340
"Again, that if I tell you the
values, the realized values of",00:13:17.340,00:13:21.220
"random variables Y and Z, this
is not going to change your",00:13:21.220,00:13:25.900
"beliefs about how likely
x is to occur.",00:13:25.900,00:13:28.900
"Whatever you believed in the
beginning, you're going to",00:13:28.900,00:13:30.900
"believe the same thing
afterwards.",00:13:30.900,00:13:33.000
"So it's important to keep that
intuition in mind, because",00:13:33.000,00:13:36.130
"sometimes this way you can tell
whether random variables",00:13:36.130,00:13:39.200
"are independent without having
to do calculations and to",00:13:39.200,00:13:42.820
check this formula.,00:13:42.820,00:13:44.930
"OK, so let's check our concepts",00:13:44.930,00:13:47.300
with a simple example.,00:13:47.300,00:13:49.250
"Let's look at two random
variables that are discrete,",00:13:49.250,00:13:52.220
"take values between
one and for each.",00:13:52.220,00:13:55.100
"And this is a table that
gives us the joint PMF.",00:13:55.100,00:13:57.890
"So it tells us the probability
that X equals to 2 and Y",00:13:57.890,00:14:05.720
"equals to 1 happening
simultaneously.",00:14:05.720,00:14:08.040
"It's an event that has
probability 1/20.",00:14:08.040,00:14:10.810
"Are these two random variables
independent?",00:14:10.810,00:14:14.510
"You can try to check a
condition like this.",00:14:14.510,00:14:17.610
"But can we tell directly
from the table?",00:14:17.610,00:14:21.940
"If I tell you a value of Y,
could that give you useful",00:14:21.940,00:14:28.470
information about X?,00:14:28.470,00:14:29.720
Certainly.,00:14:32.180,00:14:32.860
"If I tell you that Y is equal
to 1, this tells you that X",00:14:32.860,00:14:38.680
must be equal to 2.,00:14:38.680,00:14:40.990
"But if I tell you that Y was
equal to 3, this tells you",00:14:40.990,00:14:44.870
"that, still, X could
be anything.",00:14:44.870,00:14:47.540
"So telling you the value of
Y kind of changes what you",00:14:47.540,00:14:52.220
"expect or what you consider
possible for the values of the",00:14:52.220,00:14:57.240
other random variable.,00:14:57.240,00:14:59.020
"So by just inspecting here, we
can tell that the random",00:14:59.020,00:15:03.070
variables are not independent.,00:15:03.070,00:15:04.860
Okay.,00:15:08.290,00:15:08.470
"What's the other concept we
introduced in chapter one?",00:15:08.470,00:15:10.990
"We introduced the concept of
conditional independence.",00:15:10.990,00:15:14.060
"And conditional independence is
like ordinary independence",00:15:14.060,00:15:17.120
"but applied to a conditional
universe where we're given",00:15:17.120,00:15:20.420
some information.,00:15:20.420,00:15:21.780
"So suppose someone tells you
that the outcome of the",00:15:21.780,00:15:24.610
"experiment is such that X is
less than or equal to 2 and Y",00:15:24.610,00:15:30.420
is larger than or equal to 3.,00:15:30.420,00:15:33.920
"So we are given the information
that we now live",00:15:33.920,00:15:37.670
inside this universe.,00:15:37.670,00:15:40.010
"So what happens inside
this universe?",00:15:40.010,00:15:42.080
"Inside this universe, our random
variables are going to",00:15:42.080,00:15:47.200
"have a new joint PMF which is
conditioned on the event that",00:15:47.200,00:15:55.140
"we were told that
it has occurred.",00:15:55.140,00:15:58.650
"So let A correspond to this
sort of event here.",00:15:58.650,00:16:04.780
"And now we're dealing with
conditional probabilities.",00:16:04.780,00:16:06.900
"What are those conditional
probabilities?",00:16:06.900,00:16:09.490
We can put them in a table.,00:16:09.490,00:16:11.490
"So it's a two by two table,
since we only have two",00:16:11.490,00:16:14.220
possible values.,00:16:14.220,00:16:15.540
What are they going to be?,00:16:15.540,00:16:18.080
"Well, these probabilities
show up in the ratios",00:16:18.080,00:16:20.740
"1, 2, 2, and 4.",00:16:20.740,00:16:22.910
"Those ratios have to
stay the same.",00:16:22.910,00:16:25.480
"The probabilities need
to add up to one.",00:16:25.480,00:16:29.700
"So what should the denominators
be since these",00:16:29.700,00:16:34.030
numbers add up to nine?,00:16:34.030,00:16:35.380
"These are the conditional
probabilities.",00:16:35.380,00:16:37.820
"So this is the conditional
PMF in this example.",00:16:37.820,00:16:40.575
"Now, in this conditional
universe, is x",00:16:43.870,00:16:46.990
independent from y?,00:16:46.990,00:16:48.255
"If I tell you that y takes this
value, so we live in this",00:16:51.230,00:17:01.450
"universe, what do you
know about x?",00:17:01.450,00:17:04.980
"What you know about x is at this
value is twice as likely",00:17:04.980,00:17:08.109
as that value.,00:17:08.109,00:17:09.930
"If I condition on y taking this
value, so we're living",00:17:09.930,00:17:13.859
"here, what do you
know about x?",00:17:13.859,00:17:16.450
"What you know about x is that
this value is twice as likely",00:17:16.450,00:17:21.660
as that value.,00:17:21.660,00:17:23.240
So it's the same.,00:17:23.240,00:17:24.500
"Whether we live here or we live
there, this x is twice as",00:17:24.500,00:17:30.250
likely as that x.,00:17:30.250,00:17:33.670
"So the conditional PMF in this
new universe, the conditional",00:17:33.670,00:17:41.560
"PMF of X given y, in the new
universe is the same as the",00:17:41.560,00:17:55.970
"marginal PMF of X, but of course
in the new universe.",00:17:55.970,00:18:01.250
"So no matter what y is,
the conditional",00:18:01.250,00:18:04.370
PMF of X is the same.,00:18:04.370,00:18:06.860
"And that conditional
PMF is 1/3 and 2/3.",00:18:06.860,00:18:12.150
"This is the conditional PMF of
X in the new universe no",00:18:12.150,00:18:15.150
matter what y occurs.,00:18:15.150,00:18:17.000
"So Y does not give us any
information about X, doesn't",00:18:17.000,00:18:20.330
"cause us to change our beliefs
inside this little universe.",00:18:20.330,00:18:25.620
"And therefore the two random
variables are independent.",00:18:25.620,00:18:28.440
"Now, the other way that you
can verify that we have",00:18:28.440,00:18:31.180
"independence is to find the
marginal PMFs of the two",00:18:31.180,00:18:34.960
random variables.,00:18:34.960,00:18:36.250
"The marginal PMF of
X, you find it by",00:18:36.250,00:18:39.650
adding those two terms.,00:18:39.650,00:18:41.100
You get 1/3.,00:18:41.100,00:18:42.720
"Adding those two terms,
you get 2/3.",00:18:42.720,00:18:44.620
"Marginal PMF of Y, you find it,
you add these two terms,",00:18:44.620,00:18:48.530
and you get 1/3.,00:18:48.530,00:18:51.410
"And the marginal PMF of Y
here is going to be 2/3.",00:18:51.410,00:18:56.470
"And then you ask the question,
is the joint the product of",00:18:56.470,00:18:59.700
the marginals?,00:18:59.700,00:19:00.860
And indeed it is.,00:19:00.860,00:19:02.630
This times this gives you 1/9.,00:19:02.630,00:19:05.330
This times this gives you 2/9.,00:19:05.330,00:19:08.050
"So the values in the table with
the joint PMFs is the",00:19:08.050,00:19:12.180
"product of the marginal PMFs of
X and Y in this universe,",00:19:12.180,00:19:17.220
so the two random variables are,00:19:17.220,00:19:19.090
independent inside this universe.,00:19:19.090,00:19:21.850
"So we say that they're
conditionally independent.",00:19:21.850,00:19:26.704
All right.,00:19:26.704,00:19:28.500
"Now let's move to the new topic,
to the new concept that",00:19:28.500,00:19:32.720
"we introduce in this chapter,
which is the concept of",00:19:32.720,00:19:35.170
expectations.,00:19:35.170,00:19:36.440
"So what are the things
to know here?",00:19:36.440,00:19:38.200
One is the general idea.,00:19:38.200,00:19:40.150
"The way to think about
expectations is that it's",00:19:40.150,00:19:43.140
"something like the average value
for random variable if",00:19:43.140,00:19:46.080
"you do an experiment over and
over, and if you interpret",00:19:46.080,00:19:49.590
probabilities as frequencies.,00:19:49.590,00:19:51.550
"So you get x's over and over
with a certain frequency --",00:19:51.550,00:19:57.030
P(x) --,00:19:57.030,00:19:58.670
"a particular value, little
x, gets realized.",00:19:58.670,00:20:01.160
"And each time that this happens,
you get x dollars.",00:20:01.160,00:20:03.960
"How many dollars do you
get on the average?",00:20:03.960,00:20:06.040
"Well, this formula gives you
that particular average.",00:20:06.040,00:20:09.330
"So first thing we do is to write
down a definition for",00:20:09.330,00:20:13.190
this sort of concept.,00:20:13.190,00:20:15.420
"But then the other things you
need to know is how to",00:20:15.420,00:20:19.810
"calculate expectations using
shortcuts sometimes, and what",00:20:19.810,00:20:23.990
properties they have.,00:20:23.990,00:20:25.440
"The most important shortcut
there is is that, if you want",00:20:25.440,00:20:28.500
"to calculate the expected value,
the average value for a",00:20:28.500,00:20:31.250
"random variable, you do not need
to find the PMF of that",00:20:31.250,00:20:36.380
random variable.,00:20:36.380,00:20:37.530
"But you can work directly with
the x's and the y's.",00:20:37.530,00:20:41.180
"So you do the experiment
over and over.",00:20:41.180,00:20:44.210
"The outcome of the experiment
is a pair (x,y).",00:20:44.210,00:20:46.670
"And each time that a certain
(x,y) happens,",00:20:46.670,00:20:49.400
you get so many dollars.,00:20:49.400,00:20:51.280
"So this fraction of the time,
a certain (x,y) happens.",00:20:51.280,00:20:54.990
"And that fraction of the time,
you get so many dollars, so",00:20:54.990,00:20:58.050
"this is the average number
of dollars that you get.",00:20:58.050,00:21:00.860
"So what you end up, since it
is the average, then that",00:21:00.860,00:21:05.230
"means that it corresponds
to the expected value.",00:21:05.230,00:21:07.830
"Now, this is something that, of
course, needs a little bit",00:21:07.830,00:21:09.820
of mathematical proof.,00:21:09.820,00:21:10.850
"But this is just a different
way of accounting.",00:21:10.850,00:21:13.880
"And it turns out we give
you the right answer.",00:21:13.880,00:21:16.510
"And it's a very useful
shortcut.",00:21:16.510,00:21:19.420
"Now, when we're talking about
functions of random variables,",00:21:19.420,00:21:22.070
"in general, we cannot speak
just about averages.",00:21:22.070,00:21:26.620
"That is, the expected value
of a function of a random",00:21:26.620,00:21:29.690
"variable is not the same
as the function of",00:21:29.690,00:21:31.860
the expected values.,00:21:31.860,00:21:33.320
"A function of averages is
not the same as the",00:21:33.320,00:21:36.120
average of a function.,00:21:36.120,00:21:38.380
"So in general, this
is not true.",00:21:38.380,00:21:40.510
"But what it's important to know
is to know the exceptions",00:21:40.510,00:21:43.960
to this rule.,00:21:43.960,00:21:45.370
"And the important exceptions
are mainly two.",00:21:45.370,00:21:48.620
One is the case of linear,00:21:48.620,00:21:51.560
functions of a random variable.,00:21:51.560,00:21:53.040
We discussed this last time.,00:21:53.040,00:21:54.800
"So the expected value of
temperature in Celsius is, you",00:21:54.800,00:21:59.810
"first find the expected value of
temperature in Fahrenheit,",00:21:59.810,00:22:03.340
"and then you do the conversion
to Celsius.",00:22:03.340,00:22:05.810
"So whether you first average and
then do the conversion to",00:22:05.810,00:22:08.600
"the new units or not, it
shouldn't matter when you get",00:22:08.600,00:22:11.730
the result.,00:22:11.730,00:22:13.740
"The other property that turns
out to be true when you talk",00:22:13.740,00:22:16.740
"about multiple random variables
is that expectation",00:22:16.740,00:22:19.280
still behaves linearly.,00:22:19.280,00:22:21.070
"So let X, Y, and Z be the score
of a random student at",00:22:21.070,00:22:26.600
"each one of the three
sections of the SAT.",00:22:26.600,00:22:29.940
"So the overall SAT score is X
plus Y plus Z. This is the",00:22:29.940,00:22:36.310
"average score, the average
total SAT score.",00:22:36.310,00:22:40.940
"Another way to calculate that
average is to look at the",00:22:40.940,00:22:43.790
"first section of the SAT and
see what was the average.",00:22:43.790,00:22:47.480
"Look at the second section, look
at what was the average,",00:22:47.480,00:22:50.710
"and so the third, and
add the averages.",00:22:50.710,00:22:53.470
"So you can do the averages for
each section separately, add",00:22:53.470,00:22:56.910
"the averages, or you can find
total scores for each student",00:22:56.910,00:23:00.500
and average them.,00:23:00.500,00:23:01.710
"So I guess you probably believe
that this is correct",00:23:01.710,00:23:05.690
"if you talk just about
averaging scores.",00:23:05.690,00:23:09.030
"Since expectations are just the
variation of averages, it",00:23:09.030,00:23:12.580
"turns out that this is
also true in general.",00:23:12.580,00:23:16.010
"And the derivation of this is
very simple, based on the",00:23:16.010,00:23:19.760
expected value rule.,00:23:19.760,00:23:21.320
"And you can look at
it in the notes.",00:23:21.320,00:23:24.450
"So this is one exception,
which is linearity.",00:23:24.450,00:23:27.740
"The second important exception
is the case of independent",00:23:27.740,00:23:31.540
"random variables, that the
product of two random",00:23:31.540,00:23:34.520
"variables has an expectation
which is the product of the",00:23:34.520,00:23:37.830
expectations.,00:23:37.830,00:23:38.980
"In general, this is not true.",00:23:38.980,00:23:41.400
"But for the case where we have
independence, the expectation",00:23:41.400,00:23:47.010
works out as follows.,00:23:47.010,00:23:48.080
"Using the expected value rule,
this is how you calculate the",00:23:48.080,00:23:55.130
"expected value of a function
of a random variable.",00:23:55.130,00:23:59.170
"So think of this as being your
g(X, Y) and this being your",00:23:59.170,00:24:04.810
"g(little x, y).",00:24:04.810,00:24:06.160
"So this is something that's
generally true.",00:24:06.160,00:24:08.760
"Now, if we have independence,
then the PMFs factor out, and",00:24:08.760,00:24:20.350
"then you can separate this sum
by bringing together the x",00:24:20.350,00:24:25.660
"terms, bring them outside
the y summation.",00:24:25.660,00:24:30.130
"And you find that this is the
same as expected value of X",00:24:30.130,00:24:34.370
"times the expected value of Y.
So independence is used in",00:24:34.370,00:24:38.890
this step here.,00:24:38.890,00:24:40.140
"OK, now what if X and Y are
independent, but instead of",00:24:44.020,00:24:48.640
"taking the expectation of
X times Y, we take the",00:24:48.640,00:24:51.020
"expectation of the product of
two functions of X and Y?",00:24:51.020,00:24:56.600
"I claim that the expected value
of the product is still",00:24:56.600,00:24:59.560
"going to be the product of
the expected values.",00:24:59.560,00:25:02.630
How do we show that?,00:25:02.630,00:25:04.180
"We could show it by just redoing
this derivation here.",00:25:04.180,00:25:09.230
"Instead of X and Y, we would
have g(X) and h(Y), so the",00:25:09.230,00:25:13.500
algebra goes through.,00:25:13.500,00:25:14.850
"But there's a better way to
think about it which is more",00:25:14.850,00:25:17.720
conceptual.,00:25:17.720,00:25:18.960
And here's the idea.,00:25:18.960,00:25:20.886
"If X and Y are independent,
what does it mean?",00:25:20.886,00:25:25.750
"X does not convey any
information about Y. If X",00:25:25.750,00:25:31.180
"conveys no information about Y,
does X convey information",00:25:31.180,00:25:36.350
about h(Y)?,00:25:36.350,00:25:40.500
No.,00:25:40.500,00:25:41.940
"If X tells me nothing about Y,
nothing new, it shouldn't tell",00:25:41.940,00:25:46.160
me anything about h(Y).,00:25:46.160,00:25:50.580
"Now, if X tells me nothing about
h of h(Y), could g(X)",00:25:50.580,00:25:59.270
tell me something about h(Y)?,00:25:59.270,00:26:01.470
No.,00:26:01.470,00:26:02.250
"So the idea is that, if X is
unrelated to Y, doesn't have",00:26:02.250,00:26:06.780
"any useful information, then
g(X) could not have any useful",00:26:06.780,00:26:11.080
information for h(Y).,00:26:11.080,00:26:13.250
"So if X and Y are independent,
then g(X) and h(Y) are also",00:26:13.250,00:26:21.030
independent.,00:26:21.030,00:26:22.280
"So this is something that
one can try to prove",00:26:27.150,00:26:29.430
"mathematically, but it's more
important to understand",00:26:29.430,00:26:31.500
conceptually why this is so.,00:26:31.500,00:26:34.530
"It's in terms of conveying
information.",00:26:34.530,00:26:38.220
"So if X tells me nothing about
Y, X cannot tell me anything",00:26:38.220,00:26:44.950
"about Y cubed, or X cannot
tell me anything by Y",00:26:44.950,00:26:48.490
"squared, and so on.",00:26:48.490,00:26:51.030
That's the idea.,00:26:51.030,00:26:52.260
"And once we are convinced that
g(X) and h(Y) are independent,",00:26:52.260,00:26:57.180
"then we can apply our previous
rule, that for independent",00:26:57.180,00:27:00.550
"random variables, expectations
multiply the right way.",00:27:00.550,00:27:04.390
"Apply the previous rule, but
apply it now to these two",00:27:04.390,00:27:08.660
independent random variables.,00:27:08.660,00:27:10.490
"And we get the conclusion
that we wanted.",00:27:10.490,00:27:12.785
"Now, besides expectations, we
also introduced the concept of",00:27:15.500,00:27:19.050
the variance.,00:27:19.050,00:27:20.300
"And if you remember the
definition of the variance,",00:27:23.560,00:27:27.450
"let me write down the formula
for the variance of aX.",00:27:27.450,00:27:31.100
"It's the expected value of the
random variable that we're",00:27:31.100,00:27:34.920
"looking at minus the expected
value of the random variable",00:27:34.920,00:27:39.630
that we're looking at.,00:27:39.630,00:27:42.050
"So this is the difference
of the random",00:27:42.050,00:27:44.780
variable from its mean.,00:27:44.780,00:27:47.850
"And we take that difference
and square it, so it's the",00:27:47.850,00:27:50.880
"squared distance from the
mean, and then take",00:27:50.880,00:27:53.070
"expectations of the
whole thing.",00:27:53.070,00:27:55.250
"So when you look at that
expression, you realize that a",00:27:55.250,00:27:59.570
"can be pulled out of
those expressions.",00:27:59.570,00:28:01.780
"And because there is a squared,
when you pull out the",00:28:04.540,00:28:10.340
"a, it's going to come
out as an a-squared.",00:28:10.340,00:28:12.980
"So that gives us the rule for
finding the variance of a",00:28:12.980,00:28:16.050
"scale or product of
a random variable.",00:28:16.050,00:28:18.990
"The variance captures the idea
of how wide, how spread out a",00:28:18.990,00:28:22.370
certain distribution is.,00:28:22.370,00:28:24.210
"Bigger variance means it's
more spread out.",00:28:24.210,00:28:26.600
"Now, if you take a random
variable and the constants to",00:28:26.600,00:28:29.360
"it, what does it do to
its distribution?",00:28:29.360,00:28:31.960
"It just shifts it, but it
doesn't change its width.",00:28:31.960,00:28:35.480
"So intuitively it
means that the",00:28:35.480,00:28:37.140
variance should not change.,00:28:37.140,00:28:39.030
"You can check that
mathematically, but it should",00:28:39.030,00:28:42.360
also make sense intuitively.,00:28:42.360,00:28:44.290
"So the variance, when you add
the constant, does not change.",00:28:44.290,00:28:47.710
"Now, can you add variances is
the way we added expectations?",00:28:47.710,00:28:51.680
Does variance behave linearly?,00:28:51.680,00:28:54.760
It turns out that not always.,00:28:54.760,00:28:57.810
"Here, we need a condition.",00:28:57.810,00:28:59.270
It's only in special cases--,00:28:59.270,00:29:03.880
"for example, when the two
random variables are",00:29:03.880,00:29:06.210
independent--,00:29:06.210,00:29:07.190
that you can add variances.,00:29:07.190,00:29:09.300
"The variance of the sum is the
sum of the variances if X and",00:29:09.300,00:29:13.300
Y are independent.,00:29:13.300,00:29:15.370
"The derivation of this is,
again, very short and simple.",00:29:15.370,00:29:18.880
"We'll skip it, but it's an
important fact to remember.",00:29:18.880,00:29:22.590
"Now, to appreciate why this
equality is not true always,",00:29:22.590,00:29:26.140
"we can think of some
extreme examples.",00:29:26.140,00:29:28.980
"Suppose that X is the same as
Y. What's going to be the",00:29:28.980,00:29:32.250
variance of X plus Y?,00:29:32.250,00:29:34.520
"Well, X plus Y, in this case,
is the same as 2X, so we're",00:29:34.520,00:29:39.810
"going to get 4 times the
variance of X, which is",00:29:39.810,00:29:44.620
"different than the variance of
X plus the variance of X.",00:29:44.620,00:29:49.770
"So that expression would give
us twice the variance of X.",00:29:49.770,00:29:52.920
"But actually now it's 4 times
the variance of X. The other",00:29:52.920,00:29:56.460
"extreme would be if X is equal
to -Y. Then the variance is",00:29:56.460,00:30:01.990
"the variance of the random
variable, which is always",00:30:01.990,00:30:05.390
equal to 0.,00:30:05.390,00:30:07.020
"Now, a random variable which
is always equal to 0 has no",00:30:07.020,00:30:09.980
uncertainty.,00:30:09.980,00:30:10.700
"It is always equal to its mean
value, so the variance, in",00:30:10.700,00:30:14.570
"this case, turns out to be 0.",00:30:14.570,00:30:17.090
"So in both of these cases,
of course we have random",00:30:17.090,00:30:19.940
"variables that are extremely
dependent.",00:30:19.940,00:30:23.020
Why are they dependent?,00:30:23.020,00:30:24.740
"Because if I tell you something
about Y, it tells",00:30:24.740,00:30:27.940
"you an awful lot about the value
of X. There's a lot of",00:30:27.940,00:30:32.020
"information about X if
I tell you Y, in this",00:30:32.020,00:30:34.910
case or in that case.,00:30:34.910,00:30:37.050
"And finally, a short drill.",00:30:37.050,00:30:39.940
"If I tell you that the random
variables are independent and",00:30:39.940,00:30:42.570
"you want to calculate the
variance of a linear",00:30:42.570,00:30:44.840
"combination of this kind,
then how do you argue?",00:30:44.840,00:30:48.330
"You argue that, since X and Y
are independent, this means",00:30:48.330,00:30:51.940
"that X and 3Y are also
independent.",00:30:51.940,00:30:55.660
"X has no information about Y, so
X has no information about",00:30:55.660,00:30:59.610
"-Y. X has no information about
-Y, so X should not have any",00:30:59.610,00:31:05.000
information about -3Y.,00:31:05.000,00:31:10.270
So X and -3Y are independent.,00:31:10.270,00:31:14.400
"So the variance of Z should be
the variance of X plus the",00:31:14.400,00:31:18.480
"variance of -3Y, which is the
variance of X plus 9 times the",00:31:18.480,00:31:26.910
"variance of Y. The important
thing to note here is that no",00:31:26.910,00:31:31.760
"matter what happens, you
end up getting a",00:31:31.760,00:31:34.080
"plus here, not a minus.",00:31:34.080,00:31:37.000
"So that's the sort of important
thing to remember in",00:31:37.000,00:31:41.160
this type of calculation.,00:31:41.160,00:31:42.410
"So this has been all concepts,
reviews, new",00:31:44.820,00:31:48.890
concepts and all that.,00:31:48.890,00:31:50.390
It's the usual fire hose.,00:31:50.390,00:31:52.720
"Now let's use them to do
something useful finally.",00:31:52.720,00:31:56.680
"So let's revisit our old
example, the binomial",00:31:56.680,00:31:59.220
"distribution, which counts the
number of successes in",00:31:59.220,00:32:03.350
independent trials of a coin.,00:32:03.350,00:32:06.230
"It's a biased coin that has
a probability of heads, or",00:32:06.230,00:32:09.030
"probability of success, equal
to p at each trial.",00:32:09.030,00:32:13.000
"Finally, we can go through the
exercise of calculating the",00:32:13.000,00:32:16.160
"expected value of this
random variable.",00:32:16.160,00:32:18.820
"And there's the way of
calculating that expectation",00:32:18.820,00:32:21.790
"that would be the favorite
of those people who enjoy",00:32:21.790,00:32:24.260
"algebra, which is to write down
the definition of the",00:32:24.260,00:32:27.500
expected value.,00:32:27.500,00:32:28.740
"We add over all possible values
of the random variable,",00:32:28.740,00:32:31.980
"over all the possible k's, and
weigh them according to the",00:32:31.980,00:32:35.580
"probabilities that this
particular k occurs.",00:32:35.580,00:32:38.440
"The probability that X takes on
a particular value k is, of",00:32:38.440,00:32:42.250
"course, the binomial
PMF, which is",00:32:42.250,00:32:44.820
this familiar formula.,00:32:44.820,00:32:47.560
"Clearly, that would be a messy
and challenging calculation.",00:32:47.560,00:32:50.480
Can we find a shortcut?,00:32:50.480,00:32:52.490
There's a very clever trick.,00:32:52.490,00:32:54.010
"There's lots of problems in
probability that you can",00:32:54.010,00:32:56.690
"approach really nicely by
breaking up the random",00:32:56.690,00:33:00.000
"variable of interest into a
sum of simpler and more",00:33:00.000,00:33:03.830
manageable random variables.,00:33:03.830,00:33:06.010
"And if you can make it to be a
sum of random variables that",00:33:06.010,00:33:09.700
"are just 0's or 1's,
so much the better.",00:33:09.700,00:33:12.590
Life is easier.,00:33:12.590,00:33:13.990
"Random variables that take
values 0 or 1, we call them",00:33:13.990,00:33:16.850
indicator variables.,00:33:16.850,00:33:18.380
"They indicate whether an event
has occurred or not.",00:33:18.380,00:33:21.700
"In this case, we look at each
coin flip one at a time.",00:33:21.700,00:33:25.600
"For the i-th flip, if it
resulted in heads or a",00:33:25.600,00:33:29.710
"success, we record it 1.",00:33:29.710,00:33:32.110
"If not, we record it 0.",00:33:32.110,00:33:34.220
"And then we look at the
random variable.",00:33:34.220,00:33:37.540
"If we take the sum of the Xi's,
what is it going to be?",00:33:37.540,00:33:42.580
"We add one each time that we get
a success, so the sum is",00:33:42.580,00:33:48.030
"going to be the total
number of successes.",00:33:48.030,00:33:50.820
"So we break up the random
variable of interest as a sum",00:33:50.820,00:33:53.900
"of really nice and simple
random variables.",00:33:53.900,00:33:57.610
"And now we can use the linearity
of expectations.",00:33:57.610,00:34:00.380
"We're going to find the
expectation of X by finding",00:34:00.380,00:34:02.800
"the expectation of the Xi's
and then adding the",00:34:02.800,00:34:05.700
expectations.,00:34:05.700,00:34:06.770
"What's the expected
value of Xi?",00:34:06.770,00:34:09.520
"Well, Xi takes the value 1 with
probability p, and takes",00:34:09.520,00:34:13.050
"the value 0 with probability
1-p.",00:34:13.050,00:34:15.610
"So the expected value
of Xi is just p.",00:34:15.610,00:34:19.070
"So the expected value of X is
going to be just n times p.",00:34:19.070,00:34:24.889
"Because X is the sum of n terms,
each one of which has",00:34:24.889,00:34:29.560
"expectation p, the expected
value of the sum is the sum of",00:34:29.560,00:34:33.050
the expected values.,00:34:33.050,00:34:34.600
"So I guess that's a pretty good
shortcut for doing this",00:34:34.600,00:34:38.440
"horrendous calculation
up there.",00:34:38.440,00:34:40.790
"So in case you didn't realize
it, that's what we just",00:34:40.790,00:34:47.210
"established without
doing any algebra.",00:34:47.210,00:34:51.940
Good.,00:34:51.940,00:34:52.219
"How about the variance
of X, of Xi?",00:34:52.219,00:34:56.150
Two ways to calculate it.,00:34:56.150,00:34:57.570
"One is by using directly the
formula for the variance,",00:34:57.570,00:35:01.160
which would be --,00:35:01.160,00:35:02.370
let's see what it would be.,00:35:02.370,00:35:03.900
"With probability
p, you get a 1.",00:35:03.900,00:35:06.800
"And in this case, you are
so far from the mean.",00:35:06.800,00:35:11.270
"That's your squared distance
from the mean.",00:35:11.270,00:35:13.950
"With probability 1-p, you
get a 0, which is so far",00:35:13.950,00:35:18.750
away from the mean.,00:35:18.750,00:35:20.380
"And then you can simplify that
formula and get an answer.",00:35:20.380,00:35:24.380
"How about a slightly easier
way of doing it.",00:35:24.380,00:35:28.660
"Instead of doing the algebra
here, let me indicate the",00:35:28.660,00:35:31.360
slightly easier way.,00:35:31.360,00:35:33.420
"We have a formula for the
variance that tells us that we",00:35:33.420,00:35:36.070
"can find the variance by
proceeding this way.",00:35:36.070,00:35:42.290
"That's a formula that's
generally true for variances.",00:35:42.290,00:35:45.980
Why is this easier?,00:35:45.980,00:35:47.380
"What's the expected value
of Xi squared?",00:35:47.380,00:35:49.560
Backtrack.,00:35:52.240,00:35:53.290
"What is Xi squared, after all?",00:35:53.290,00:35:57.140
It's the same thing as Xi.,00:35:57.140,00:35:59.510
"Since Xi takes value 0 and 1, Xi
squared also takes the same",00:35:59.510,00:36:04.200
"values, 0 and 1.",00:36:04.200,00:36:05.780
"So the expected value of Xi
squared is the same as the",00:36:05.780,00:36:09.050
"expected value of Xi,
which is equal to p.",00:36:09.050,00:36:11.990
"And the expected value of Xi
squared is p squared, so we",00:36:15.120,00:36:20.530
"get the final answer,
p times (1-p).",00:36:20.530,00:36:24.680
"If you were to work through and
do the cancellations in",00:36:24.680,00:36:28.630
"this messy expression here,
after one line you would also",00:36:28.630,00:36:32.400
get to the same formula.,00:36:32.400,00:36:34.050
"But this sort of illustrates
that working with this formula",00:36:34.050,00:36:38.240
"for the variance, sometimes
things work",00:36:38.240,00:36:40.550
out a little faster.,00:36:40.550,00:36:43.090
"Finally, are we in business?",00:36:43.090,00:36:45.420
"Can we calculate the variance
of the random",00:36:45.420,00:36:47.820
variable X as well?,00:36:47.820,00:36:50.100
"Well, we have the rule that
for independent random",00:36:50.100,00:36:52.650
"variables, the variance
of the sum is",00:36:52.650,00:36:55.680
the sum of the variances.,00:36:55.680,00:36:57.870
"So to find the variance of X,
we just need to add the",00:36:57.870,00:37:00.930
variances of the Xi's.,00:37:00.930,00:37:02.960
"We have n Xi's, and each
one of them has",00:37:02.960,00:37:07.140
variance p_n times (1-p).,00:37:07.140,00:37:10.110
And we are done.,00:37:10.110,00:37:12.290
"So this way, we have calculated
both the mean and",00:37:12.290,00:37:17.780
"the variance of the binomial
random variable.",00:37:17.780,00:37:21.550
"It's interesting to look at this
particular formula and",00:37:21.550,00:37:27.280
see what it tells us.,00:37:27.280,00:37:29.180
"If you are to plot the variance
of X as a function of",00:37:29.180,00:37:33.470
"p, it has this shape.",00:37:33.470,00:37:36.050
"And the maximum is
here at 1/2.",00:37:45.900,00:37:51.310
"p times (1-p) is 0 when
p is equal to 0.",00:37:51.310,00:37:55.150
"And when p equals to 1, it's a
quadratic, so it must have",00:37:55.150,00:37:58.570
this particular shape.,00:37:58.570,00:38:00.250
So what does it tell us?,00:38:00.250,00:38:02.080
"If you think about variance as
a measure of uncertainty, it",00:38:02.080,00:38:05.880
"tells you that coin flips
are most uncertain when",00:38:05.880,00:38:10.290
your coin is fair.,00:38:10.290,00:38:12.620
"When p is equal to 1/2, that's
when you have the most",00:38:12.620,00:38:16.190
randomness.,00:38:16.190,00:38:17.050
And this is kind of intuitive.,00:38:17.050,00:38:18.790
"if on the other hand I tell you
that the coin is extremely",00:38:18.790,00:38:21.460
"biased, p very close to 1, which
means it almost always",00:38:21.460,00:38:26.490
"gives you heads, then
that would be",00:38:26.490,00:38:29.460
a case of low variance.,00:38:29.460,00:38:30.630
"There's low variability
in the results.",00:38:30.630,00:38:32.870
"There's little uncertainty about
what's going to happen.",00:38:32.870,00:38:35.270
"It's going to be mostly heads
with some occasional tails.",00:38:35.270,00:38:39.570
So p equals 1/2.,00:38:39.570,00:38:42.010
"Fair coin, that's the coin which
is the most uncertain of",00:38:42.010,00:38:45.350
"all coins, in some sense.",00:38:45.350,00:38:47.240
"And it corresponds to the
biggest variance.",00:38:47.240,00:38:49.240
"It corresponds to an X that has
the widest distribution.",00:38:49.240,00:38:53.760
"Now that we're on a roll and we
can calculate such hugely",00:38:53.760,00:38:57.680
"complicated sums in simple ways,
let us try to push our",00:38:57.680,00:39:01.400
"luck and do a problem with
this flavor, but a little",00:39:01.400,00:39:05.100
harder than that.,00:39:05.100,00:39:06.590
So you go to one of those,00:39:06.590,00:39:07.960
old-fashioned cocktail parties.,00:39:07.960,00:39:09.910
"All males at least will have
those standard big hats which",00:39:09.910,00:39:16.010
look identical.,00:39:16.010,00:39:16.990
"They check them in when
they walk in.",00:39:16.990,00:39:19.700
"And when they walk out, since
they look pretty identical,",00:39:19.700,00:39:23.390
"they just pick a random
hat and go home.",00:39:23.390,00:39:26.830
"So n people, they pick their
hats completely at random,",00:39:26.830,00:39:31.080
"quote, unquote, and
then leave.",00:39:31.080,00:39:33.950
"And the question is, to say
something about the number of",00:39:33.950,00:39:36.970
"people who end up, by accident
or by luck, to get back their",00:39:36.970,00:39:42.070
"own hat, the exact same hat
that they checked in.",00:39:42.070,00:39:45.170
"OK, first what do we mean
completely at random?",00:39:45.170,00:39:48.490
"Completely at random, we
basically mean that any",00:39:48.490,00:39:51.060
"permutation of the hats
is equally likely.",00:39:51.060,00:39:54.180
"Any way of distributing those
n hats to the n people, any",00:39:54.180,00:39:58.520
"particular way is as likely
as any other way.",00:39:58.520,00:40:01.350
"So there's complete symmetry
between hats and people.",00:40:01.350,00:40:05.230
"So what we want to do is to
calculate the expected value",00:40:05.230,00:40:08.490
"and the variance of this random
variable X. Let's start",00:40:08.490,00:40:11.460
with the expected value.,00:40:11.460,00:40:13.240
"Let's reuse the trick from
the binomial case.",00:40:13.240,00:40:17.840
"So total number of hats picked,
we're going to think",00:40:17.840,00:40:21.110
"of total number of hats
picked as a sum of",00:40:21.110,00:40:24.140
"(0, 1) random variables.",00:40:24.140,00:40:26.900
"X1 tells us whether person
1 got their own hat back.",00:40:26.900,00:40:30.470
"If they did, we record a 1.",00:40:30.470,00:40:32.920
"X2, the same thing.",00:40:32.920,00:40:34.960
"By adding all X's is how many
1's did we get, which counts",00:40:34.960,00:40:40.910
"how many people selected
their own hats.",00:40:40.910,00:40:45.510
"So we broke down the random
variable of interest, the",00:40:45.510,00:40:48.100
"number of people who get their
own hats back, as a sum of",00:40:48.100,00:40:51.500
random variables.,00:40:51.500,00:40:53.570
"And these random variables,
again, are easy to handle,",00:40:53.570,00:40:56.200
because they're binary.,00:40:56.200,00:40:58.010
The only take two values.,00:40:58.010,00:40:59.250
"What's the probability that Xi
is equal to 1, the i-th person",00:40:59.250,00:41:03.500
"has a probability that they
get their own hat?",00:41:03.500,00:41:06.730
There's n hats by symmetry.,00:41:06.730,00:41:09.430
"The chance is that they end up
getting their own hat, as",00:41:09.430,00:41:11.890
"opposed to any one of the
other n - 1 hats,",00:41:11.890,00:41:14.930
is going to be 1/n.,00:41:14.930,00:41:18.020
"So what's the expected
value of Xi?",00:41:18.020,00:41:20.710
It's one times 1/n.,00:41:20.710,00:41:23.130
"With probability 1/n, you get
your own hat, or you get a",00:41:23.130,00:41:26.510
"value of 0 with probability
1-1/n, which is 1/n.",00:41:26.510,00:41:30.960
"All right, so we got the
expected value of the Xi's.",00:41:34.660,00:41:38.360
"And remember, we want to do is
to calculate the expected",00:41:38.360,00:41:41.510
"value of X by using this
decomposition?",00:41:41.510,00:41:46.900
"Are the random variables Xi
independent of each other?",00:41:46.900,00:41:52.230
"You can try to answer that
question by writing down a",00:41:52.230,00:41:55.470
"joint PMF for the X's,
but I'm sure that",00:41:55.470,00:41:58.510
you will not succeed.,00:41:58.510,00:42:00.000
But can you think intuitively?,00:42:00.000,00:42:02.740
"If I tell you information about
some of the Xi's, does",00:42:02.740,00:42:05.940
"it give you information about
the remaining ones?",00:42:05.940,00:42:08.920
Yeah.,00:42:08.920,00:42:09.300
"If I tell you that out of 10
people, 9 of them got their",00:42:09.300,00:42:13.950
"own hat back, does that
tell you something",00:42:13.950,00:42:16.710
about the 10th person?,00:42:16.710,00:42:18.330
Yes.,00:42:18.330,00:42:18.690
"If 9 got their own hat, then the
10th must also have gotten",00:42:18.690,00:42:22.510
their own hat back.,00:42:22.510,00:42:24.170
"So the first 9 random variables
tell you something",00:42:24.170,00:42:27.170
about the 10th one.,00:42:27.170,00:42:28.790
"And conveying information of
this sort, that's the case of",00:42:28.790,00:42:33.000
dependence.,00:42:33.000,00:42:34.410
"All right, so the random
variables are not independent.",00:42:34.410,00:42:38.100
Are we stuck?,00:42:38.100,00:42:39.030
"Can we still calculate the
expected value of X?",00:42:39.030,00:42:43.240
"Yes, we can.",00:42:43.240,00:42:45.210
"And the reason we can is that
expectations are linear.",00:42:45.210,00:42:50.710
"Expectation of a sum of random
variables is the sum of the",00:42:50.710,00:42:53.940
expectations.,00:42:53.940,00:42:55.140
And that's always true.,00:42:55.140,00:42:57.490
"There's no independence
assumption that's being used",00:42:57.490,00:43:00.710
to apply that rule.,00:43:00.710,00:43:02.540
"So we have that the expected
value of X is the sum of the",00:43:02.540,00:43:06.980
expected value of the Xi's.,00:43:06.980,00:43:09.580
"And this is a property
that's always true.",00:43:09.580,00:43:12.970
You don't need independence.,00:43:12.970,00:43:14.350
You don't care.,00:43:14.350,00:43:15.590
"So we're adding n terms,
each one of which has",00:43:15.590,00:43:18.660
expected value 1/n.,00:43:18.660,00:43:20.430
And the final answer is 1.,00:43:20.430,00:43:22.670
"So out of the 100 people who
selected hats at random, on",00:43:22.670,00:43:27.430
"the average, you expect only one
of them to end up getting",00:43:27.430,00:43:32.590
their own hat back.,00:43:32.590,00:43:35.830
Very good.,00:43:35.830,00:43:36.640
"So since we are succeeding so
far, let's try to see if we",00:43:36.640,00:43:41.620
"can succeed in calculating
the variance as well.",00:43:41.620,00:43:44.620
"And of course, we will.",00:43:44.620,00:43:46.580
"But it's going to be a little
more complicated.",00:43:46.580,00:43:50.160
"The reason it's going to be a
little more complicated is",00:43:50.160,00:43:52.760
"because the Xi's are not
independent, so the variance",00:43:52.760,00:43:56.500
"of the sum is not the same as
the sum of the variances.",00:43:56.500,00:44:00.280
"So it's not enough to find the
variances of the Xi's.",00:44:00.280,00:44:04.320
We'll have to do more work.,00:44:04.320,00:44:06.930
And here's what's involved.,00:44:06.930,00:44:08.550
"Let's start with the general
formula for the variance,",00:44:08.550,00:44:12.320
"which, as I mentioned before,
it's usually the simpler way",00:44:12.320,00:44:15.950
"to go about calculating
variances.",00:44:15.950,00:44:18.430
"So we need to calculate the
expected value for X-squared,",00:44:18.430,00:44:21.800
"and subtract from it the
expectation squared.",00:44:21.800,00:44:27.110
"Well, we already found the
expected value of X. It's",00:44:27.110,00:44:31.010
equal to 1.,00:44:31.010,00:44:31.870
So 1-squared gives us just 1.,00:44:31.870,00:44:34.580
"So we're left with the task of
calculating the expected value",00:44:34.580,00:44:37.980
"of X-squared, the random
variable X-squared.",00:44:37.980,00:44:43.440
"Let's try to follow
the same idea.",00:44:43.440,00:44:45.610
"Write this messy random
variable, X-squared, as a sum",00:44:45.610,00:44:49.770
"of hopefully simpler
random variables.",00:44:49.770,00:44:54.440
"So X is the sum of the
Xi's, so you square",00:44:54.440,00:44:59.350
both sides of this.,00:44:59.350,00:45:01.560
"And then you expand the
right-hand side.",00:45:01.560,00:45:05.150
"When you expand the right-hand
side, you get the squares of",00:45:05.150,00:45:09.390
the terms that appear here.,00:45:09.390,00:45:11.420
"And then you get all
the cross-terms.",00:45:11.420,00:45:14.230
"For every pair of (i,j) that
are different, i different",00:45:14.230,00:45:19.100
"than j, you're going to have
a cross-term in the sum.",00:45:19.100,00:45:24.030
"So now, in order to calculate
the expected value of",00:45:24.030,00:45:29.230
"X-squared, what does
our task reduce to?",00:45:29.230,00:45:32.480
"It reduces to calculating the
expected value of this term",00:45:32.480,00:45:36.230
"and calculating the expected
value of that term.",00:45:36.230,00:45:38.690
"So let's do them
one at a time.",00:45:38.690,00:45:41.060
"Expected value of Xi squared,
what is it going to be?",00:45:41.060,00:45:47.040
Same trick as before.,00:45:47.040,00:45:48.660
"Xi takes value 0 or 1, so Xi
squared takes just the same",00:45:48.660,00:45:53.350
"values, 0 or 1.",00:45:53.350,00:45:55.290
So that's the easy one.,00:45:55.290,00:45:57.010
"That's the same as expected
value of Xi, which we already",00:45:57.010,00:46:00.680
know to be 1/n.,00:46:00.680,00:46:04.410
"So this gives us a first
contribution down here.",00:46:04.410,00:46:07.830
"The expected value of this
term is going to be what?",00:46:10.840,00:46:14.220
"We have n terms in
the summation.",00:46:14.220,00:46:17.210
"And each one of these terms
has an expectation of 1/n.",00:46:17.210,00:46:21.800
"So we did a piece
of the puzzle.",00:46:21.800,00:46:24.710
"So now let's deal with the
second piece of the puzzle.",00:46:24.710,00:46:28.480
"Let's find the expected
value of Xi times Xj.",00:46:28.480,00:46:32.020
"Now by symmetry, the expected
value of Xi times Xj is going",00:46:32.020,00:46:35.540
"to be the same no matter
what i and j you see.",00:46:35.540,00:46:39.900
"So let's just think about X1
and X2 and try to find the",00:46:39.900,00:46:44.930
expected value of X1 and X2.,00:46:44.930,00:46:48.260
"X1 times X2 is a random
variable.",00:46:48.260,00:46:51.710
What values does it take?,00:46:51.710,00:46:53.960
Only 0 or 1?,00:46:53.960,00:46:56.570
"Since X1 and X2 are 0 or 1,
their product can only take",00:46:56.570,00:47:00.000
the values of 0 or 1.,00:47:00.000,00:47:02.010
"So to find the probability
distribution of this random",00:47:02.010,00:47:04.990
"variable, it's just sufficient
to find the probability that",00:47:04.990,00:47:07.320
it takes the value of 1.,00:47:07.320,00:47:09.530
"Now, what does X1 times
X2 equal to 1 mean?",00:47:09.530,00:47:14.500
"It means that X1 was
1 and X2 was 1.",00:47:14.500,00:47:19.500
"The only way that you can get
a product of 1 is if both of",00:47:19.500,00:47:22.390
them turned out to be 1's.,00:47:22.390,00:47:24.350
"So that's the same as saying,
persons 1 and 2 both picked",00:47:24.350,00:47:29.570
their own hats.,00:47:29.570,00:47:31.980
"The probability that person 1
and person 2 both pick their",00:47:31.980,00:47:35.510
"own hats is the probability of
two things happening, which is",00:47:35.510,00:47:39.600
"the product of the first thing
happening times the",00:47:39.600,00:47:42.320
"conditional probability
of the second, given",00:47:42.320,00:47:44.310
that the first happened.,00:47:44.310,00:47:46.160
"And in words, this is the
probability that the first",00:47:46.160,00:47:48.690
"person picked their own hat
times the probability that the",00:47:48.690,00:47:51.840
"second person picks their own
hat, given that the first",00:47:51.840,00:47:54.920
"person already picked
their own.",00:47:54.920,00:47:56.990
"So what's the probability
that the first person",00:47:56.990,00:47:58.820
picks their own hat?,00:47:58.820,00:48:00.760
We know that it's 1/n.,00:48:00.760,00:48:03.040
"Now, how about the
second person?",00:48:03.040,00:48:05.030
"If I tell you that one person
has their own hat, and that",00:48:05.030,00:48:09.540
"person takes their hat and goes
away, from the point of",00:48:09.540,00:48:13.240
"view of the second person,
there's n - 1 people left",00:48:13.240,00:48:17.250
looking at n - 1 hats.,00:48:17.250,00:48:19.770
"And they're getting just
hats at random.",00:48:19.770,00:48:22.330
"What's the chance that
I will get my own?",00:48:22.330,00:48:24.930
It's 1/n - 1.,00:48:24.930,00:48:26.180
"So think of them as person 1
goes, picks a hat at random,",00:48:29.210,00:48:33.700
"it happens to be their
own, and it leaves.",00:48:33.700,00:48:36.850
"You're left with n - 1 people,
and there are n",00:48:36.850,00:48:40.120
- 1 hats out there.,00:48:40.120,00:48:41.250
"Person 2 goes and picks a hat
at random, with probability",00:48:41.250,00:48:44.490
"1/n - 1, is going to
pick his own hat.",00:48:44.490,00:48:48.820
"So the expected value now of
this random variable is,",00:48:48.820,00:48:52.400
"again, that same number,
because this is",00:48:52.400,00:48:54.520
"a 0, 1 random variable.",00:48:54.520,00:48:57.500
"So this is the same as expected
value of Xi times Xj",00:48:57.500,00:49:02.370
when i different than j.,00:49:02.370,00:49:04.810
"So here, all that's left to do
is to add the expectations of",00:49:04.810,00:49:09.830
these terms.,00:49:09.830,00:49:10.540
"Each one of these terms has an
expected value that's 1/n",00:49:10.540,00:49:14.480
times (1/n - 1).,00:49:14.480,00:49:16.910
And how many terms do we have?,00:49:16.910,00:49:19.170
"How many of these are
we adding up?",00:49:19.170,00:49:21.410
It's n-squared - n.,00:49:24.840,00:49:28.950
"When you expand the quadratic,
there's a total",00:49:28.950,00:49:31.830
of n-squared terms.,00:49:31.830,00:49:33.890
"Some are self-terms,
n of them.",00:49:33.890,00:49:37.860
"And the remaining number of
terms is n-squared - n.",00:49:37.860,00:49:42.170
"So here we got n-squared
- n terms.",00:49:42.170,00:49:48.310
"And so we need to multiply
here with n-squared - n.",00:49:48.310,00:49:51.200
"And after you realize that this
number here is 1, and you",00:49:53.810,00:49:59.980
"realize that this is the same
as the denominator, you get",00:49:59.980,00:50:03.490
"the answer that the expected
value of X squared equals 2.",00:50:03.490,00:50:06.750
"And then, finally going up to
the top formula, we get the",00:50:06.750,00:50:10.120
"expected value of X squared,
which is 2 - 1, and the",00:50:10.120,00:50:14.720
variance is just equal to 1.,00:50:14.720,00:50:17.610
"So the variance of this random
variable, number of people who",00:50:17.610,00:50:21.680
"get their own hats back,
is also equal to 1,",00:50:21.680,00:50:25.130
equal to the mean.,00:50:25.130,00:50:26.540
Looks like magic.,00:50:26.540,00:50:27.690
Why is this the case?,00:50:27.690,00:50:29.220
"Well, there's a deeper
explanation why these two",00:50:29.220,00:50:31.550
"numbers should come out
to be the same.",00:50:31.550,00:50:33.630
"But this is something that would
probably have to wait a",00:50:33.630,00:50:35.980
"couple of chapters before we
could actually explain it.",00:50:35.980,00:50:39.420
And so I'll stop here.,00:50:39.420,00:50:40.730
