"PROFESSOR: So you may recall
that, in the last lecture, we",00:00:19.580,00:00:25.090
"more or less solved the drunken
student problem,",00:00:25.090,00:00:29.220
looking at a random walk.,00:00:29.220,00:00:32.050
"I now want to move on and
discuss some variants of the",00:00:32.050,00:00:36.510
"random walk problem that are
collectively known as biased",00:00:36.510,00:00:42.230
random walks.,00:00:42.230,00:00:53.260
"So the notion here is, the walk
is still stochastic but",00:00:53.260,00:00:57.950
"there is some bias in the
direction, so the movements",00:00:57.950,00:01:01.230
"are not uniformly distributed or
equally distributed in all",00:01:01.230,00:01:05.500
directions.,00:01:05.500,00:01:07.560
"As I go through this, I want
you to sort of, think in",00:01:07.560,00:01:11.940
"advance about what the take-home
message should be.",00:01:11.940,00:01:16.520
"One, and this is probably the
most important part for today,",00:01:16.520,00:01:20.740
"is I want to illustrate how by
designing our programs in a",00:01:20.740,00:01:24.560
"nice way around classes, we
can change them to do",00:01:24.560,00:01:29.670
"something else writing a
minimal amount of code.",00:01:29.670,00:01:35.430
"And the idea here is that
classes are not there just to",00:01:35.430,00:01:39.180
"provide some syntax that makes
life complicated, but to",00:01:39.180,00:01:42.950
"actually provide a mechanism
that lets us structure our",00:01:42.950,00:01:46.050
"programs in a way that we
can modify them later.",00:01:46.050,00:01:52.380
"I also want to give you a bit
more experience looking at",00:01:52.380,00:01:55.670
"data, and understanding how,
when you get the results of a",00:01:55.670,00:01:59.820
"simulation or anything else that
provides you with data,",00:01:59.820,00:02:04.000
"you can plot, them study the
plots, and try and use those",00:02:04.000,00:02:08.720
"to develop an understanding
about what's going on.",00:02:08.720,00:02:12.460
"And finally, I want to just get
you thinking more about",00:02:12.460,00:02:16.860
random behavior.,00:02:16.860,00:02:18.560
"Because we're going to talk a
lot more this semester and in",00:02:18.560,00:02:21.080
"general throughout your careers,
you'll see a lot of",00:02:21.080,00:02:24.300
uses of stochastic things.,00:02:24.300,00:02:26.530
"All right, so let's think about
these biased walks.",00:02:26.530,00:02:31.280
"So for example, assume that
the drunk grew up in South",00:02:31.280,00:02:36.610
"Florida, and really hates
the New England winter.",00:02:36.610,00:02:40.440
"Well there might be a bias that
even though the drunk is",00:02:40.440,00:02:43.730
"not in total control, she's kind
of wandering southward.",00:02:43.730,00:02:48.940
"So there's a bias when taking a
step to more likely go south",00:02:48.940,00:02:52.380
than certainly north.,00:02:52.380,00:02:55.400
"Or imagine that the drunk is
photosensitive and moves",00:02:55.400,00:02:59.160
"either towards the sun
or away from the sun,",00:02:59.160,00:03:02.030
or some such thing.,00:03:02.030,00:03:04.410
"So we're going to look at
different things of that",00:03:04.410,00:03:06.910
"nature and think about, I'll
come back to Chutes and",00:03:06.910,00:03:09.970
"Ladders later in the lecture,
you can speculate",00:03:09.970,00:03:13.390
on why this is here.,00:03:13.390,00:03:19.210
And we'll look at that.,00:03:19.210,00:03:21.540
"So, this is on the front page
of your handout here.",00:03:21.540,00:03:26.910
"I've taken the random walk
program we looked at last time",00:03:26.910,00:03:32.560
and changed it a bit.,00:03:32.560,00:03:35.370
"And in particular,
I've changed the",00:03:35.370,00:03:41.210
way the drunk works.,00:03:41.210,00:03:46.430
So let's look at the code.,00:03:46.430,00:03:50.170
"Wow, haven't even done
anything it's --",00:03:50.170,00:03:52.570
see how this works.,00:03:52.570,00:04:07.220
"So now, drunk itself is a very
small class, one I don't",00:04:07.220,00:04:14.030
"actually intend to
ever instantiate.",00:04:14.030,00:04:19.410
"I've pared it down, it has
only two methods in it.",00:04:19.410,00:04:23.880
"It has an init, which is the
same as before, and a move",00:04:23.880,00:04:29.890
"which is the same as before,
almost the same.",00:04:29.890,00:04:35.150
"Now I'm going to have the
class usual drunk.",00:04:35.150,00:04:40.090
"That's the drunk we looked
at the last time.",00:04:40.090,00:04:42.900
"And this usual drunk will behave
just like the drunk we",00:04:42.900,00:04:45.780
looked at last time.,00:04:45.780,00:04:48.570
"In here, I'm going to override
the move method of the",00:04:48.570,00:04:55.260
"inherited superclass, and what
this is going to do is, it's",00:04:55.260,00:05:02.770
"going to make the same random
choice it made before and then",00:05:02.770,00:05:07.380
"it's going to call drunk
dot move with",00:05:07.380,00:05:10.580
the new compass point.,00:05:10.580,00:05:14.420
"So all I've done is, I've taken
a couple of lines of",00:05:14.420,00:05:17.230
"code out of the previous
implementation and moved it to",00:05:17.230,00:05:21.380
the subclass.,00:05:21.380,00:05:23.390
"So it's now, excuse me, in the
subclass I'm making the",00:05:23.390,00:05:29.540
"decision about which
direction to move.",00:05:29.540,00:05:32.400
"Once I've made that decision,
then I can call the drunk in",00:05:32.400,00:05:37.540
the superclass.,00:05:37.540,00:05:39.360
"Notice here, when I've made
the call, drunk dot move.",00:05:39.360,00:05:47.930
"So usually you're expecting
me to write",00:05:47.930,00:05:50.640
something like d dot move.,00:05:50.640,00:05:54.610
The object.,00:05:54.610,00:05:55.930
"Here, instead I'm specifying
which class to get the move",00:05:55.930,00:06:01.170
"from, So this is saying, don't
call my local move, call the",00:06:01.170,00:06:07.710
move from the superclass.,00:06:07.710,00:06:11.670
"There are a number of other
syntaxes I could've used to",00:06:11.670,00:06:14.410
accomplish the same thing.,00:06:14.410,00:06:16.350
"I used this because it seemed
the most straightforward.",00:06:16.350,00:06:24.830
"Now let's compare the usual
drunk to the cold drunk.",00:06:24.830,00:06:29.960
"So the cold drunk, again, I've
overridden the move, and now",00:06:29.960,00:06:35.560
it does something different.,00:06:35.560,00:06:37.810
"It gets the random compass point
as before, but if it",00:06:37.810,00:06:42.730
"happens to be south, it
calls drunk dot move",00:06:42.730,00:06:47.420
with twice the distance.,00:06:47.420,00:06:53.500
"So whenever I get the notion
I'm moving south, because I",00:06:53.500,00:06:59.070
"love the warmth, I actually move
twice as fast. So instead",00:06:59.070,00:07:04.210
"of taking one step, which I do
to the other compass points,",00:07:04.210,00:07:07.100
"if I happen to be going south
I'll take two steps.",00:07:07.100,00:07:11.360
"So I'm biased towards
moving southward.",00:07:11.360,00:07:17.830
"And then I call drunk
dot move.",00:07:17.830,00:07:23.640
"Otherwise, I call drunk
dot move with",00:07:23.640,00:07:26.340
the distances before.,00:07:26.340,00:07:30.540
"So I've isolated into the
subclass this notion of being",00:07:30.540,00:07:34.800
heat-seeking.,00:07:34.800,00:07:38.060
"We've got a third sub class,
ew drunk, known",00:07:38.060,00:07:42.170
for east west drunk.,00:07:42.170,00:07:47.100
"And here, what I've done is, I
choose to compass point and",00:07:47.100,00:07:52.160
"then while it's not either east
or west, I choose again.",00:07:52.160,00:07:57.200
"So this drunk can only move
eastward or westward.",00:07:57.200,00:08:00.790
Can't move north or south.,00:08:00.790,00:08:07.810
"So again you'll see I'm able to
have three kinds of drunks.",00:08:07.810,00:08:12.790
"Who as we will see, exhibit
rather different behavior from",00:08:12.790,00:08:15.550
"each other with a minimal amount
of change to the code.",00:08:15.550,00:08:25.650
"If we look down at the bottom,
we'll see that the code is",00:08:25.650,00:08:33.880
"pretty much exactly what
it was last time.",00:08:33.880,00:08:37.540
"By the way, this doesn't
quite match the",00:08:37.540,00:08:39.340
code in your handout.,00:08:39.340,00:08:40.970
"I decided to make the plots
a little bit prettier with",00:08:40.970,00:08:44.230
"better titles and things, but
when I tried to put these in",00:08:44.230,00:08:47.550
your handouts it wouldn't fit.,00:08:47.550,00:08:49.740
"So I have a little more compact
things, but this is, I",00:08:49.740,00:08:53.360
"think, a better way
to write it.",00:08:53.360,00:08:55.630
"But essentially, perform trial,
perform sim, answer",00:08:55.630,00:09:00.520
"quest, are all identical to
what they were before.",00:09:00.520,00:09:05.940
"So because I structured my
program in such a way that the",00:09:05.940,00:09:11.850
"drunk's behavior was independent
of all the code",00:09:11.850,00:09:15.620
"for the generating the trials
and plotting the results, I",00:09:15.620,00:09:21.420
"didn't have to change
any of that.",00:09:21.420,00:09:24.920
"And this is the key
to good design.",00:09:24.920,00:09:27.680
"Is to isolate decisions in small
parts of your program,",00:09:27.680,00:09:33.270
"so when as inevitable happens,
you want to enhance the",00:09:33.270,00:09:37.650
"program, or you discover you've
done something wrong,",00:09:37.650,00:09:40.860
"the number changes you
make is not large.",00:09:40.860,00:09:48.100
"OK, one thing we do need to look
at down here is, it's not",00:09:48.100,00:09:53.290
"quite the same as before,
because we'll see that there's",00:09:53.290,00:09:57.550
"an extra parameter to these
things called drunk type.",00:09:57.550,00:10:06.240
"So if we start with answer
question, it takes as before,",00:10:06.240,00:10:10.940
"the time, the number of trials,
a title, and this one",00:10:10.940,00:10:14.700
"extra thing called
the drunk type.",00:10:14.700,00:10:18.960
"And then when it goes on and
it calls perform sim, it",00:10:18.960,00:10:22.620
passes the drunk type.,00:10:22.620,00:10:27.310
And this is the key line here.,00:10:27.310,00:10:38.710
"Before, you may recall
we just said d equals",00:10:38.710,00:10:41.690
drunk with the arguments.,00:10:41.690,00:10:45.340
"Here, I say d equals
drunk type.",00:10:45.340,00:10:51.730
So what is drunk type?,00:10:51.730,00:10:56.650
Drunk type is itself a type.,00:10:56.650,00:11:00.710
"We can use types, you know
variables can have as their",00:11:00.710,00:11:04.350
"values types, parameters can
have as their values types.",00:11:04.350,00:11:09.610
"So I'm just passing the type
around so that here, when it",00:11:09.610,00:11:13.630
"comes time to get a drunk,
I get a drunk of",00:11:13.630,00:11:17.160
the appropriate type.,00:11:17.160,00:11:21.620
"So I can now answer the question
about a usual drunk,",00:11:21.620,00:11:25.110
"or a cold drunk,
or a ew drunk.",00:11:25.110,00:11:31.700
"This is very common kind of
programming paradigm.",00:11:31.700,00:11:36.880
"We've talked about it before,
but this is yet another",00:11:36.880,00:11:40.430
"example of how we use
polymorphism.",00:11:40.430,00:11:44.500
Polymorphism.,00:11:44.500,00:11:47.950
"We write our code in such a way
that it works with many",00:11:47.950,00:11:51.470
types of objects.,00:11:51.470,00:11:54.950
"Here we're writing code
that will work with",00:11:54.950,00:11:57.740
any subtype of drunk.,00:11:57.740,00:12:01.630
"Now I'd better not
pass it a float.",00:12:01.630,00:12:04.170
"You know, if I answer quest, and
instead of something like",00:12:04.170,00:12:08.230
"usual drunk or cold drunk or e
w drunk, I pass it float or",00:12:08.230,00:12:12.360
"int, the world will come
crashing down around my head.",00:12:12.360,00:12:17.560
"But I haven't, so you'll see
down here, I pass it num",00:12:17.560,00:12:21.720
"steps, number trials,
and usual drunk.",00:12:21.720,00:12:27.130
Which is the name of?,00:12:27.130,00:12:28.530
A class.,00:12:28.530,00:12:33.050
Any questions about this?,00:12:33.050,00:12:38.760
Yes?,00:12:38.760,00:12:39.160
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:12:39.160,00:12:45.360
"PROFESSOR: Louder, please?",00:12:45.360,00:12:46.330
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:12:46.330,00:12:53.370
"PROFESSOR: Good,
good question.",00:12:53.370,00:12:54.950
"The question is, does a drunk
type make a new drunk?",00:12:54.950,00:12:58.250
"Now, I have so much candy to
choose from, I don't know what",00:12:58.250,00:13:00.630
to throw you.,00:13:00.630,00:13:02.470
"Do you like Tootsie Rolls,
Snickers, Tootsie Roll Pops,",00:13:02.470,00:13:07.670
"Dots, what's your choice?",00:13:07.670,00:13:11.220
Snickers.,00:13:11.220,00:13:19.370
"OK, so what is it?",00:13:19.370,00:13:23.040
"Down here nothing is created
when that call was made.",00:13:23.040,00:13:29.970
"It was if I had typed the
word float or int.",00:13:29.970,00:13:34.180
"I'm merely saying, here is a
type, and the parameter should",00:13:34.180,00:13:41.460
now be bound to that type.,00:13:41.460,00:13:45.860
"Now any time you use the
parameter, it's just as if you",00:13:45.860,00:13:49.680
"had written the string, in
this case, usual drunk.",00:13:49.680,00:13:56.240
"So when I get up to here, think
about, it will take, the",00:13:56.240,00:14:08.790
"variable drunk type, evaluate
it, it will evaluate to a type",00:14:08.790,00:14:19.610
"usual drunk, say, in
the first call.",00:14:19.610,00:14:23.040
"And then it will, just as if
I had written usual drunk,",00:14:23.040,00:14:28.040
"invoke the init method of drunk,
and create a new drunk,",00:14:28.040,00:14:34.430
"but this drunk will be
of type usual drunk",00:14:34.430,00:14:36.890
rather than a drunk.,00:14:36.890,00:14:40.300
Does that make sense?,00:14:40.300,00:14:44.970
"All right, so this avoids my
having to write a whole bunch",00:14:44.970,00:14:50.320
"of tests, I could have passed
a string, and said if the",00:14:50.320,00:14:54.590
"string said usual drunk, then
d equals something.",00:14:54.590,00:14:59.140
"But here instead of
that, I'm actually",00:14:59.140,00:15:00.860
passing the type itself.,00:15:00.860,00:15:07.330
OK?,00:15:07.330,00:15:12.710
"So other than the fact that I
have to pass the type around,",00:15:12.710,00:15:16.300
"this is exactly the
same as before.",00:15:16.300,00:15:21.570
"Now just for fun, we saw that
last time when I asked you",00:15:21.570,00:15:26.150
"what did usual drunk do, there
was some confusion.",00:15:26.150,00:15:30.100
"Not confusion, just a bad guess
about how the drunk",00:15:30.100,00:15:34.410
would wander.,00:15:34.410,00:15:35.950
"So, let's try it again.",00:15:35.950,00:15:38.950
"What do you think about
the cold drunk?",00:15:38.950,00:15:44.490
"Will the cold drunk get further
from the origin than",00:15:44.490,00:15:48.850
the usual drunk?,00:15:48.850,00:15:50.740
Not further from the origin?,00:15:50.740,00:15:51.880
"Who thinks the cold drunk
will be further away",00:15:51.880,00:15:55.450
the end of 500 steps?,00:15:55.450,00:15:56.710
"Who thinks the cold drunk will
not be further away?",00:15:56.710,00:16:01.610
"And I'll bet we can all agr --
got that right, I think -- and",00:16:01.610,00:16:05.590
"I'll bet you'll all agree that,
with higher probability,",00:16:05.590,00:16:08.470
"the cold drunk will be south
of the origin than north of",00:16:08.470,00:16:12.870
the origin.,00:16:12.870,00:16:14.520
"More interesting, how
about the ew drunk?",00:16:14.520,00:16:19.440
"So this is a drunk that only
goes east or west, east or",00:16:19.440,00:16:24.120
"west. Will this drunk, well,
first of all, what's the",00:16:24.120,00:16:31.950
expected distance?,00:16:31.950,00:16:33.280
"Do you think it should
be close to zero or",00:16:33.280,00:16:34.880
not close to zero?,00:16:34.880,00:16:37.560
"Who thinks it should
be close to 0?",00:16:37.560,00:16:41.180
"Who thinks it won't
be close to 0?",00:16:41.180,00:16:44.780
"Well you guys have all fallen
for the same trick you fell",00:16:44.780,00:16:47.370
for last time.,00:16:47.370,00:16:49.530
Fooled you twice.,00:16:49.530,00:16:50.510
"Be careful, one more
and you're out.",00:16:50.510,00:16:54.230
As we'll see.,00:16:54.230,00:16:56.560
But it's interesting.,00:16:56.560,00:16:57.770
"So let's run this program
and see what happens.",00:16:57.770,00:17:12.680
"I can take a just a second
or two and we should",00:17:12.680,00:17:15.590
get a bunch of plots.,00:17:15.590,00:17:22.470
"All right, so here's
the usual drunk.",00:17:22.470,00:17:25.710
"100 trials and just as before,
wandered away.",00:17:25.710,00:17:33.050
"Moderately smooth, but of course
little ups and downs,",00:17:33.050,00:17:36.440
"maybe suggesting averaging
over 100 trials",00:17:36.440,00:17:39.990
is not quite enough.,00:17:39.990,00:17:42.230
"I felt a little better if it
were smoother, but the trend",00:17:42.230,00:17:45.920
"is pretty clear here, I think
we probably don't doubt it.",00:17:45.920,00:17:52.970
"Well, look at cold drunk.",00:17:52.970,00:17:56.530
Like a shot heading south.,00:17:56.530,00:18:00.520
"So here we see, there's bias,
that if you get south you go",00:18:00.520,00:18:04.930
"twice as far makes a
huge difference.",00:18:04.930,00:18:08.670
"Instead of being roughly 20
steps away, it's roughly 120",00:18:08.670,00:18:13.450
steps away.,00:18:13.450,00:18:16.550
"So we see, and this is something
to think about, a",00:18:16.550,00:18:21.500
"small bias can end up making a
huge difference over time.",00:18:21.500,00:18:27.520
"This is why casinos
do so well.",00:18:27.520,00:18:31.230
"They don't have to have a very
much of a bias in their favor",00:18:31.230,00:18:34.370
"on each roll of the dice in
order to accumulate a lot of",00:18:34.370,00:18:37.640
money over time.,00:18:37.640,00:18:40.410
"It's why if you just weigh your
dice a little bit, so",00:18:40.410,00:18:43.040
"that they're not fair, you'll
do very very well.",00:18:43.040,00:18:47.020
I'm not recommending that.,00:18:47.020,00:18:52.100
Kind of interesting.,00:18:52.100,00:18:55.220
"The e w drunk is pretty much the
same distance away as the",00:18:55.220,00:18:59.680
usual drunk.,00:18:59.680,00:19:04.440
"This is why we run these
simulations, is because we",00:19:04.440,00:19:10.090
learn things.,00:19:10.090,00:19:10.780
"Now, I have to confess,
it fooled me, too.",00:19:10.780,00:19:13.920
"The first time I ran this, I
looked at this and said, wait",00:19:13.920,00:19:16.570
"a minute, that's not
what I expected.",00:19:16.570,00:19:20.800
"So I scratched my head, and
thought about, all right, why",00:19:20.800,00:19:24.610
is it behaving this way?,00:19:24.610,00:19:27.770
"This happens me a lot in my own
research, that I crunch",00:19:27.770,00:19:32.260
"some data, do some plots, look
at it, get surprised, and on",00:19:32.260,00:19:36.950
"the basis of that I learned
something about the underlying",00:19:36.950,00:19:41.100
system I'm modeling.,00:19:41.100,00:19:42.960
"Because it provokes me to
think in ways I had not",00:19:42.960,00:19:46.910
thought before I saw the data.,00:19:46.910,00:19:49.510
This is an important lesson.,00:19:49.510,00:19:50.900
"You don't ignore the data, you
try and explain the data.",00:19:50.900,00:19:54.740
"So when I thought about what
happened, I realize that while",00:19:54.740,00:19:58.200
"I might have started at the
origin, and after the first",00:19:58.200,00:20:02.290
"step I'm equally likely
to be here or here.",00:20:02.290,00:20:07.950
"Once I've taken the first step,
now my expected location",00:20:07.950,00:20:17.260
"is not zero, right?",00:20:17.260,00:20:20.600
"The first step, my expected
location was zero.",00:20:20.600,00:20:25.580
"Because equally likely to
be plus 1 or minus 1.",00:20:25.580,00:20:29.550
"But once I've taken a step and
I happen to be here, my",00:20:29.550,00:20:34.810
"expected location, if I'm here,
is plus 1, it's not 0.",00:20:34.810,00:20:40.820
"Because half the time I'll get
back to 0, but half the time",00:20:40.820,00:20:43.630
I'll get to 2.,00:20:43.630,00:20:48.100
"So once I have moved away from
where I've started, the",00:20:48.100,00:20:55.100
"expectation of where I'll
end up has changed.",00:20:55.100,00:21:03.160
"This is kind of a profound thing
to think about, because",00:21:03.160,00:21:07.880
"when we look at it, this kind of
behavior explains a lot of",00:21:07.880,00:21:12.090
surprising results in life.,00:21:12.090,00:21:14.820
"Where, if you get a small run of
random events that take you",00:21:14.820,00:21:21.620
"far from where you started,
it's hard to get back.",00:21:21.620,00:21:28.170
"So if you think about the stock
market, for example, if",00:21:28.170,00:21:32.160
"you happen to get unlucky and
have a few days or weeks or",00:21:32.160,00:21:36.420
"months, as the case may be,
where you get a run of bad",00:21:36.420,00:21:40.490
"days, it's really hard to get
back if all the movements",00:21:40.490,00:21:44.910
after that are random.,00:21:44.910,00:21:46.770
"Because you've established
a new baseline.",00:21:46.770,00:21:50.710
"And as we'll see later, when
you start doing things at",00:21:50.710,00:21:53.240
"random, it's likely you'll get a
few runs in one direction or",00:21:53.240,00:21:57.740
"another, and then you've got
a new baseline, and it's",00:21:57.740,00:22:01.940
"unlikely to get back to where
you were originally.",00:22:01.940,00:22:04.960
"We'll see a lot of
examples of this.",00:22:04.960,00:22:07.200
"But that's what's happening
here, and that's why it looks",00:22:07.200,00:22:13.530
the way it does.,00:22:13.530,00:22:17.140
That makes sense to people?,00:22:17.140,00:22:20.450
"Well, so I had this theory,
as I often do when I have",00:22:20.450,00:22:24.430
"theories, I don't believe them,
so I decided I better",00:22:24.430,00:22:28.650
"write some more code
to check it out.",00:22:28.650,00:22:34.120
"So, what I did is, I took the
previous simulation and now",00:22:34.120,00:22:40.020
"instead of looking at different
kinds of drunks, I",00:22:40.020,00:22:43.330
"got more aggressive in
thinking about my",00:22:43.330,00:22:46.990
analysis of the data.,00:22:46.990,00:22:50.440
"So again, there's
a lesson here.",00:22:50.440,00:22:53.590
"I decided I wanted to analyze
my data in new ways.",00:22:53.590,00:22:58.900
"And the beauty of it was, I
could do that without changing",00:22:58.900,00:23:03.160
"either any of the code about the
drunk, or any they of the",00:23:03.160,00:23:07.912
"code about performing the
simulation, really.",00:23:07.912,00:23:10.970
"All I had to do was do a
different kind of analysis to",00:23:10.970,00:23:14.890
a first approximation.,00:23:14.890,00:23:18.250
"So, let's look at what
I've done here.",00:23:18.250,00:23:26.170
"What I've decided to do here is
not only plot, and again, I",00:23:26.170,00:23:30.990
"think you'll see this code, not
only plot how far from the",00:23:30.990,00:23:37.830
"origin the drunk is over time,
but I'm going to actually plot",00:23:37.830,00:23:44.300
two other things.,00:23:44.300,00:23:46.870
"I'm going to use a scatter plot,
I think I use scatter in",00:23:46.870,00:23:51.880
"this one, I do, to show
where the drunk is at",00:23:51.880,00:23:54.870
each period of time.,00:23:54.870,00:23:56.070
"Actually, just all the
places the drunk",00:23:56.070,00:23:58.700
ends up in each trial.,00:23:58.700,00:24:00.880
"This will give me a visualized
way just see, OK, in my, say,",00:24:00.880,00:24:04.980
"100 trials, how many the drunk
ended up near the origin, how",00:24:04.980,00:24:08.860
"many of them ended up
really far away?",00:24:08.860,00:24:11.160
"And just, allow me to visualize
what's going on.",00:24:11.160,00:24:16.240
"And then I'm going to also use
a histogram to sort of",00:24:16.240,00:24:19.390
summarize some things.,00:24:19.390,00:24:21.400
"To get a look at the
distribution of the data.",00:24:21.400,00:24:34.430
"We've been just looking at
average results, but it's",00:24:34.430,00:24:38.620
"often the case that the average
does not really tell",00:24:38.620,00:24:41.610
the whole story.,00:24:41.610,00:24:44.190
"You want to ask, well, how many
of the drunks ended up",00:24:44.190,00:24:46.490
really far away?,00:24:46.490,00:24:48.930
"How many of the drunks ended
up where they started?",00:24:48.930,00:24:51.830
"You can't tell that
from the averages.",00:24:51.830,00:24:55.780
"So you use a distribution, which
tells you information",00:24:55.780,00:24:59.860
"about how many people
ended up where.",00:24:59.860,00:25:03.500
"So we again saw that, in a less
pleasant context, maybe,",00:25:03.500,00:25:07.400
"in looking at the quizzes,
remember I sent you some plots",00:25:07.400,00:25:10.910
"about the quizzes, and
I didn't just say,",00:25:10.910,00:25:13.470
here was the average.,00:25:13.470,00:25:16.320
"I showed you the distribution
of grades.",00:25:16.320,00:25:20.750
"That allowed you to see, not
only where you were relative",00:25:20.750,00:25:23.970
"to the average, but whether
you were an outlier.",00:25:23.970,00:25:27.360
"Was your grade much better
than the average?",00:25:27.360,00:25:30.160
"Or were there a whole bunch of
people around where you are?",00:25:30.160,00:25:33.980
"So there's a lot of information
there, that will",00:25:33.980,00:25:37.090
"help us understand what's
really going on.",00:25:37.090,00:25:41.280
So we'll run this now.,00:25:41.280,00:25:45.940
"Again, there's nothing very
interesting here about how I",00:25:45.940,00:25:48.440
"did it, I just used some of
these Pylab dot hist, which",00:25:48.440,00:25:52.200
"gives me a histogram, Pylab dot
scatter, which gives me a",00:25:52.200,00:25:55.890
scatter plot.,00:25:55.890,00:25:57.970
"I'll take 500 steps,
400 trials.",00:25:57.970,00:26:01.350
"I've done some more trials here,
so we get some smoother",00:26:01.350,00:26:04.600
"lines, better distributions.",00:26:04.600,00:26:07.370
"And then I'm going to look at
the usual drunk and ew drunk",00:26:07.370,00:26:10.140
"only, just to save some time.",00:26:10.140,00:26:24.790
At least I think I am.,00:26:24.790,00:26:31.220
"My computer runs faster
when it's plugged in.",00:26:31.220,00:26:35.280
"All right, but we have
our figures here,",00:26:35.280,00:26:37.040
let's look at them.,00:26:37.040,00:26:40.360
"So here's figure one,
the usual drunk.",00:26:40.360,00:26:42.960
"Well, all right, as we've
seen this 1000",00:26:42.960,00:26:45.880
"times, or at least six.",00:26:45.880,00:26:47.680
"So doing what it usually
does, not quite 20.",00:26:47.680,00:26:55.000
This is kind of interesting.,00:26:55.000,00:26:56.820
"This is the final locations
of the 400 trials",00:26:56.820,00:27:00.540
of the usual drunk.,00:27:00.540,00:27:02.340
"So we see some information here,
that we really couldn't",00:27:02.340,00:27:04.990
get from the averages.,00:27:04.990,00:27:08.000
"That there are more of these
points near the middle, but",00:27:08.000,00:27:12.560
"there are certainly plenty
scattered around.",00:27:12.560,00:27:18.200
"And we get to see that, they're
pretty much symmetric",00:27:18.200,00:27:21.880
around where we started.,00:27:21.880,00:27:24.760
"This is what we would
have hoped, right?",00:27:24.760,00:27:26.770
"If we had looked at it, and we
had seen all the points up",00:27:26.770,00:27:31.000
"here, or most of them up here,
we would have said, wait a",00:27:31.000,00:27:34.250
"minute, there's something
wrong with my code.",00:27:34.250,00:27:38.190
"This was supposed to not
be a biased walk,",00:27:38.190,00:27:40.550
but an unbiased walk.,00:27:40.550,00:27:43.620
"And if I'd seen a bias in this
population, I should have",00:27:43.620,00:27:47.580
"gotten nervous that I had
some problems with my",00:27:47.580,00:27:50.180
implementation.,00:27:50.180,00:27:51.760
My simulation.,00:27:51.760,00:27:53.270
"So in addition to helping me
understand results, this gives",00:27:53.270,00:27:56.920
"me some confidence that I really
am doing an unbiased",00:27:56.920,00:28:00.540
"walk, right?",00:28:00.540,00:28:03.080
"Some over here, some
over here.",00:28:03.080,00:28:04.820
"Not exactly the same, but
close enough that I feel",00:28:04.820,00:28:09.000
pretty comfortable.,00:28:09.000,00:28:19.350
"And if I look at the
distribution, which probably I",00:28:19.350,00:28:25.020
"could've if I worked really
hard, gotten from the scatter",00:28:25.020,00:28:27.930
"plot, but I really didn't want
to, we'll see that most of the",00:28:27.930,00:28:34.880
"drunks actually do end up pretty
close to the origin.",00:28:34.880,00:28:39.750
"But that there are a few that
are pretty far away.",00:28:39.750,00:28:43.960
"And again, it's close to
symmetric around zero.",00:28:43.960,00:28:49.960
"Which gives me a good feeling
that things are working the",00:28:49.960,00:28:52.590
way they should.,00:28:52.590,00:28:54.520
"This, by the way, is what's
called a normal distribution.",00:28:54.520,00:29:00.100
"Because once upon a time, people
believed this was the",00:29:00.100,00:29:04.210
way things usually happened.,00:29:04.210,00:29:07.850
"This is called either
normal or Gaussian.",00:29:07.850,00:29:16.030
"The mathematician Gauss was
one of the first people to",00:29:16.030,00:29:18.620
write about this distribution.,00:29:18.620,00:29:20.870
"We'll come back to this later,
and among other things, we'll",00:29:20.870,00:29:24.320
"try and see whether normal
is really normal.",00:29:24.320,00:29:27.770
But you see it a lot of times.,00:29:27.770,00:29:29.960
"And basically what it says is
that most of the values hang",00:29:29.960,00:29:34.410
"out around the average,
the middle.",00:29:34.410,00:29:38.360
"And there are a few outliers,
and as we get further and",00:29:38.360,00:29:42.190
"further out, fewer and
fewer points occur.",00:29:42.190,00:29:49.260
"So you'll see these kind of
curves, of distributions,",00:29:49.260,00:29:52.120
occurring a lot.,00:29:52.120,00:29:53.390
"Again, we'll come back to
distributions in a week, or",00:29:53.390,00:29:56.680
actually in a lecture or two.,00:29:56.680,00:29:58.810
"See a little bit more today,
and then more later on.",00:29:58.810,00:30:03.690
"All right, here's our east west
drunk, again as before,",00:30:03.690,00:30:13.800
drifting off to around 18.,00:30:13.800,00:30:18.470
"Well, look at these dots.",00:30:18.470,00:30:23.730
"Well, this makes me feel, that
at least I know that the drunk",00:30:23.730,00:30:26.820
"is only moving east and west.
And again you'll see, pretty",00:30:26.820,00:30:31.250
"dense in the middle and
a few outliers.",00:30:31.250,00:30:35.640
"Managed to get a little further
east than west, but",00:30:35.640,00:30:38.730
that happens.,00:30:38.730,00:30:41.520
"East is always more
attractive.",00:30:41.520,00:30:47.390
What we might have guessed.,00:30:47.390,00:30:49.810
"And if we look at the
distribution, again we can",00:30:49.810,00:30:56.410
"look at it, and I'm just giving
you the east west",00:30:56.410,00:30:59.480
"values here, and again
it's about the same.",00:30:59.480,00:31:07.160
"So, what do I want you to take
away from these graphs?",00:31:07.160,00:31:11.940
"Different plots show you
different things.",00:31:11.940,00:31:15.680
"So I'm not going to try and
claim that of these three",00:31:15.680,00:31:18.190
"different plots we did, one
is the right one to do.",00:31:18.190,00:31:22.170
"What I'm going to assert
is that you want",00:31:22.170,00:31:24.000
to do all of them.,00:31:24.000,00:31:26.930
"Try and visualize the data
in multiple ways.",00:31:26.930,00:31:31.280
"And sometimes it's much easier
to, even if different plots",00:31:31.280,00:31:36.810
"contain exactly the same
information, and in some sense",00:31:36.810,00:31:41.240
"of the scatter plot and the
histogram do contain exactly",00:31:41.240,00:31:45.500
the same information.,00:31:45.500,00:31:47.320
"In fact, there's more
information in the scatter",00:31:47.320,00:31:49.580
"plot, in some sense, because I
see each one individually.",00:31:49.580,00:31:53.630
"But it's, for me, a
lot harder to see.",00:31:53.630,00:31:57.520
"If I'd ask you from the
scatter plot, are they",00:31:57.520,00:32:00.090
normally distributed?,00:32:00.090,00:32:02.560
"You might have had a hard
time answering it.",00:32:02.560,00:32:04.920
"Particularly for the usual
drunk, where you just saw a",00:32:04.920,00:32:09.180
lot of points.,00:32:09.180,00:32:10.760
"So the idea of some summarizing
it in the",00:32:10.760,00:32:13.340
"histogram makes it much easier
to make sense of the data, and",00:32:13.340,00:32:18.680
"see what you're doing, and to
try and learn the lesson",00:32:18.680,00:32:21.600
you're trying to learn.,00:32:21.600,00:32:32.260
"OK, this makes sense
to people?",00:32:32.260,00:32:37.560
"All right, let's move on.",00:32:37.560,00:32:40.700
"Now we'll go back to this lovely
picture we had before.",00:32:40.700,00:32:48.040
"Any of you ever play the game
Chutes and Ladders?",00:32:48.040,00:32:51.380
Raise your hand?,00:32:51.380,00:32:53.050
"OK, some things never
go out of style.",00:32:53.050,00:32:57.790
"Well, imagine your poor drunk
wandering through this board,",00:32:57.790,00:33:04.070
"and every once in a while,
because I'm kind of a, not a",00:33:04.070,00:33:09.430
"nice person, I've eliminated all
the ladders, and have only",00:33:09.430,00:33:12.620
some chutes.,00:33:12.620,00:33:13.220
"And every once in a while
the drunk hits a",00:33:13.220,00:33:15.980
chute and goes whoosh.,00:33:15.980,00:33:18.770
"And in fact, let's, for the
sake of simplicity here,",00:33:18.770,00:33:26.560
"assume that the chutes are
going to, every once in a",00:33:26.560,00:33:32.230
"while, the drunk will hit a bad
spot, and go right back to",00:33:32.230,00:33:35.970
the origin.,00:33:35.970,00:33:37.300
"So this poor, say, heat-seeking
drunk who's",00:33:37.300,00:33:39.470
"trying to head south, does it
for a while and maybe gets",00:33:39.470,00:33:44.260
"zipped right back to where
he or she started.",00:33:44.260,00:33:48.230
"All right, I've now told
you I want to put",00:33:48.230,00:33:52.440
"some, make this happen.",00:33:52.440,00:33:55.740
"What part of the code do you
think I should change?",00:33:55.740,00:34:01.900
Somebody?,00:34:01.900,00:34:02.400
STUDENT: The field.,00:34:02.400,00:34:04.090
"PROFESSOR: The field,
absolutely.",00:34:04.090,00:34:11.360
"Those are good to throw
short distances.",00:34:11.360,00:34:14.280
"The field, right, because what
we're talking about here is",00:34:14.280,00:34:17.760
"not a property of the drunk,
or a property of the",00:34:17.760,00:34:21.420
"simulation, but a property of
the space in which the drunk",00:34:21.420,00:34:26.120
is wandering.,00:34:26.120,00:34:30.000
"So again, we see that by
structuring the initial",00:34:30.000,00:34:33.210
"program around the natural
abstractions that occur in the",00:34:33.210,00:34:38.370
"problem, natural kinds of
changes can be localized.",00:34:38.370,00:34:46.470
"So let's go and change
the field.",00:34:46.470,00:34:52.860
"So I'm going to have the field
I had before plus this thing",00:34:52.860,00:34:57.570
called an odd field.,00:34:57.570,00:35:03.140
"Odd field will be a
subclass of field.",00:35:03.140,00:35:06.850
"This is not odd as in
odd or even, this",00:35:06.850,00:35:08.790
is odd as in strange.,00:35:08.790,00:35:12.770
"So I'm going to first define
where my chutes are.",00:35:12.770,00:35:19.850
"So is chute will take, will
get the coordinates, and",00:35:19.850,00:35:29.540
"assign it to x and y, so it
gets the coordinates of a",00:35:29.540,00:35:32.650
"place, and then will return
abs x minus abs",00:35:32.650,00:35:37.220
y is equal to zero.,00:35:37.220,00:35:39.680
"So, where are my chutes
going to occur?",00:35:39.680,00:35:45.780
Somebody?,00:35:45.780,00:35:53.980
"Yeah, kind of radiating
out from the origin.",00:35:53.980,00:36:00.130
"Any place, so I'll have
my origin, here.",00:36:00.130,00:36:06.720
Got my graph.,00:36:06.720,00:36:08.200
"And all along here, any place
x and y are equal,",00:36:08.200,00:36:13.860
there'll be a chute.,00:36:13.860,00:36:18.180
"Now, I have to be a little bit
careful that it doesn't happen",00:36:18.180,00:36:21.590
"here, or we won't
get anywhere.",00:36:21.590,00:36:27.110
"So, and then move, in odd field,
will call field dot",00:36:27.110,00:36:32.400
"move, which is unchanged from
what it was before.",00:36:32.400,00:36:38.530
"And then it will say, if self
dot is chute, set the location",00:36:38.530,00:36:43.130
"back to 0,0.",00:36:43.130,00:36:45.690
"So the poor drunk will move as
before, and if he or she hits",00:36:45.690,00:36:50.120
"this wormhole, get instantly
teleported back to the origin.",00:36:50.120,00:36:58.220
"Very small change, but it will
give us rather different",00:36:58.220,00:37:01.910
"behaviors, at least
I think it will.",00:37:01.910,00:37:08.410
"And then if we look at how we
use it, not much changes.",00:37:08.410,00:37:17.460
"Except, what do you think is
going to have to change?",00:37:17.460,00:37:20.670
"Where will I have to make
the change, somebody?",00:37:20.670,00:37:23.420
"You can actually see
the code here.",00:37:23.420,00:37:27.840
"I'll have to get a different
field, right?",00:37:27.840,00:37:31.710
"So, at the place where I
instantiate a field, instead",00:37:31.710,00:37:35.880
"of instantiating a field, I'll
instantiate an odd field.",00:37:35.880,00:37:40.600
"Now if I'd had 16 different
kinds of odd fields, or even",00:37:40.600,00:37:44.130
"two, I might well have done
what I did with drunk.",00:37:44.130,00:37:49.500
"But in order to sort of minimize
things, I've done",00:37:49.500,00:37:53.860
something much smaller.,00:37:53.860,00:37:55.040
"So let's see, where did
we get the field?",00:37:55.040,00:37:57.400
I don't even remember.,00:37:57.400,00:37:59.780
"So, here's what I do when I'm
looking at my program and I",00:37:59.780,00:38:03.140
"want to see where
something is.",00:38:03.140,00:38:06.530
"I use the text editor, and I'm
going to search for it.",00:38:06.530,00:38:13.090
Let's see.,00:38:13.090,00:38:24.500
"Well, it's not there.",00:38:24.500,00:38:31.320
There it is.,00:38:31.320,00:38:33.710
"So here when I get my field, I
get my drunk, and then I get a",00:38:33.710,00:38:37.280
field which is an odd field.,00:38:37.280,00:38:44.280
"All right, anyone want to
speculate what will happen",00:38:44.280,00:38:46.460
when I run this one?,00:38:46.460,00:38:54.170
"Think the drunk will be closer
or further from the origin",00:38:54.170,00:38:59.150
when we're done?,00:38:59.150,00:39:00.870
Who thinks closer?,00:39:00.870,00:39:03.050
Who thinks further?,00:39:03.050,00:39:05.120
Who thinks no difference?,00:39:05.120,00:39:07.720
"Well, you're right, I mean it's
sort of logical if we",00:39:07.720,00:39:09.920
"think about it, that if every
once in a while you get to",00:39:09.920,00:39:12.180
"zipped, back it's going to be
harder to get further away.",00:39:12.180,00:39:15.220
"We'll see different behaviors,
by the way, it depends on the",00:39:15.220,00:39:17.890
"drunk, right?",00:39:17.890,00:39:19.200
"That's true for the usual drunk,
but maybe not for the",00:39:19.200,00:39:23.832
east west drunk.,00:39:23.832,00:39:27.740
We can see what happens.,00:39:27.740,00:39:29.590
So let's try some.,00:39:29.590,00:39:33.900
"We'll do it for the usual
drunk, which is the more",00:39:33.900,00:39:36.030
"interesting case
to start with.",00:39:36.030,00:39:58.030
"So you'll see whereas before we
were up just shy of 20 most",00:39:58.030,00:40:01.670
"of the time, here we don't get
very much much, further.",00:40:01.670,00:40:06.140
"We do get steadily further,
but at a lot slower pace.",00:40:06.140,00:40:13.040
"What do you think it means that,
before you remember, we",00:40:13.040,00:40:16.220
saw a pretty smooth line.,00:40:16.220,00:40:17.830
"Here we see what may look you
like a fat line, but is in",00:40:17.830,00:40:21.200
"fact a line with a lot
of wiggles in it.",00:40:21.200,00:40:25.660
"What does that imply, about
what's going on in the",00:40:25.660,00:40:30.680
"simulation, the fact that line
is jagged rather than smooth",00:40:30.680,00:40:36.430
as it was before?,00:40:36.430,00:40:41.490
Pardon?,00:40:41.490,00:40:43.390
Can't hear you?,00:40:43.390,00:40:44.070
STUDENT: That it jumps.,00:40:44.070,00:40:44.470
"PROFESSOR: Well, certainly it
happens because of the jumps,",00:40:44.470,00:40:50.320
but what else is going on?,00:40:50.320,00:40:51.680
"But what is it, sort of, imply
more, whoa, sorry about that,",00:40:51.680,00:40:55.910
more generally?,00:40:55.910,00:40:57.410
"Right, what it's saying, is
that because of the jumps,",00:40:57.410,00:41:01.190
"there's a lot more variation
from trial to trial.",00:41:01.190,00:41:07.190
"Not surprising, right, because
you sometimes you hit these",00:41:07.190,00:41:09.860
"wormholes and sometimes
you don't.",00:41:09.860,00:41:12.480
"So let's look at this
other figure.",00:41:12.480,00:41:15.330
This is kind of interesting.,00:41:15.330,00:41:18.460
So here's the scatter plot.,00:41:18.460,00:41:24.090
"And if we zoom in on it, what
we see here is, there are",00:41:24.090,00:41:37.070
"essentially holes, you
know, these alleys",00:41:37.070,00:41:41.710
where no points lie.,00:41:41.710,00:41:46.410
"Just as we might have
guessed from here.",00:41:46.410,00:41:50.380
"The only way you would get a
point lying on these alleys,",00:41:50.380,00:41:52.940
"if it happened to be the very
last step of the simulation,",00:41:52.940,00:41:55.640
"not even then, because the last
thing we do is go back to",00:41:55.640,00:41:58.740
the origin.,00:41:58.740,00:42:00.540
"So we can look at this, and say,
well, sure enough, this",00:42:00.540,00:42:04.840
"is keeping people off of a
certain part of the field.",00:42:04.840,00:42:15.790
"All right, some of you will be
happy to know we are, for the",00:42:15.790,00:42:20.110
"moment, actually maybe for the
whole rest of the term,",00:42:20.110,00:42:22.590
leaving the notion of drunks.,00:42:22.590,00:42:24.010
Though not of random walks.,00:42:24.010,00:42:26.880
"All right, any questions about
what's going on here?",00:42:26.880,00:42:30.260
"And again, I would urge you to
sort of study the code and the",00:42:30.260,00:42:32.970
"way it's been factored to
accomplish these things.",00:42:32.970,00:42:35.910
"And play with it, and look
at what you get from the",00:42:35.910,00:42:38.370

"I now want to pull back from
this specific example, and",00:42:40.870,00:42:44.620
"spend a few minutes talking
about simulation in general.",00:42:44.620,00:42:50.310
"Computer simulation really grew
hand in hand with the",00:42:50.310,00:42:55.720
"development of the computers,
from the very beginning.",00:42:55.720,00:42:59.400
"The first large-scale deployment
of computer",00:42:59.400,00:43:02.520
"simulation was as part of
the Manhattan Project.",00:43:02.520,00:43:15.720
"This was done during the war
to model the process of",00:43:15.720,00:43:19.600
nuclear detonation.,00:43:19.600,00:43:29.380
"And, in fact, what they did was
a simulation of 12 hard",00:43:29.380,00:43:33.840
"spheres, and what would
happen when they would",00:43:33.840,00:43:37.110
bump into each other.,00:43:37.110,00:43:38.960
"It was a huge step forward to
do it with simulation, since",00:43:38.960,00:43:43.300
"the whole project had been
stalled by their attempt to do",00:43:43.300,00:43:47.110
this analytically.,00:43:47.110,00:43:48.830
"They were unable to actually
solve the problem",00:43:48.830,00:43:51.050
analytically.,00:43:51.050,00:43:52.480
"And it was only when they hit
upon the notion of using a",00:43:52.480,00:43:55.120
"computer, a relatively new
tool in those days, to",00:43:55.120,00:43:58.610
"simulate it, that they
were able to get the",00:43:58.610,00:44:00.690
answers they needed.,00:44:00.690,00:44:02.700
"And they did it using something
called a Monte Carlo",00:44:02.700,00:44:06.910
simulation.,00:44:06.910,00:44:19.180
"Now in fact, that's just what
we've been doing with the",00:44:19.180,00:44:22.010
"random walk, the Monte Carlo
simulation, and I'll come back",00:44:22.010,00:44:24.960
to that in a minute.,00:44:24.960,00:44:27.160
"In general, the thing to think
about, is we use simulation",00:44:27.160,00:44:32.940
"when we really can't get a
closed form analytic solution.",00:44:32.940,00:44:39.500
"If you can put down a system of
equations and easily solve",00:44:39.500,00:44:42.750
"it to get an answer, that's
usually the right thing to do.",00:44:42.750,00:44:47.510
"But when we can't easily do
that, the right thing to do is",00:44:47.510,00:44:50.780
"typically to fall back
on simulation.",00:44:50.780,00:44:54.940
"Sometimes even when we can do
it analytically, simulation",00:44:54.940,00:44:57.930
"has some advantages, as we'll
be seeing as we go forward.",00:44:57.930,00:45:05.340
"What we're typically doing
when we're simulating",00:45:05.340,00:45:07.970
"anything, is we're attempting
to generate a sample of",00:45:07.970,00:45:31.960
representative scenarios.,00:45:31.960,00:45:43.320
"Because an exhaustive
enumeration of all possible",00:45:43.320,00:45:47.010
states would be impossible.,00:45:47.010,00:45:50.330
"So again, if sometimes you can't
solve it analytically,",00:45:50.330,00:45:53.550
"you can exhaustively enumerate
the space and then see",00:45:53.550,00:45:57.530
what's going on.,00:45:57.530,00:45:59.280
"But again, usually you can't.",00:45:59.280,00:46:01.210
"And so we look for a sample, and
the key is, it's gotta be",00:46:01.210,00:46:05.150
representative.,00:46:05.150,00:46:07.960
"Of what we would
get in reality.",00:46:07.960,00:46:11.570
"We'll see an example
of that shortly.",00:46:11.570,00:46:14.500
"So simulation attempts to build
an experimental device",00:46:14.500,00:46:20.120
"that will act like the real
system in important aspects.",00:46:20.120,00:46:25.890
"So I always think of
a simulation as an",00:46:25.890,00:46:29.170
experimental device.,00:46:29.170,00:46:32.180
"And every time I run it, I'm
running an experiment designed",00:46:32.180,00:46:37.440
"to give me some information
about the real world.",00:46:37.440,00:46:41.430
"These things are enormously
popular, so if you were to get",00:46:41.430,00:46:45.110
"on Google and look
at simulation.",00:46:45.110,00:46:52.690
"So for, example, we could Google
simulation finance.",00:46:52.690,00:47:00.540
"You know, we see we get
about 3,000,000 hits.",00:47:00.540,00:47:06.230
We can do biology.,00:47:06.230,00:47:13.600
"We get twice as many hits,
showing the relative",00:47:13.600,00:47:16.360
"importance in the world of
biology and finance.",00:47:16.360,00:47:21.770
"For all you Course 7 majors,
we should make sure that",00:47:21.770,00:47:25.150
"should compare biology
to physics.",00:47:25.150,00:47:27.650
"Oh dear, we'll see that physics
is even more important",00:47:27.650,00:47:31.280
than biology.,00:47:31.280,00:47:35.170
"And I know we have a lot of
Course 2 students in here, so",00:47:35.170,00:47:38.320
let's try mechanical.,00:47:38.320,00:47:43.310
"Oh, lot of those, too.",00:47:43.310,00:47:45.520
"And if I did baseball, or
football, we'd get more than",00:47:45.520,00:47:48.680
any of them.,00:47:48.680,00:47:50.720
"Showing the real importance
of things in the world.",00:47:50.720,00:47:54.110
"As we look at simulations, I
want you to keep in mind that",00:47:54.110,00:48:00.570
"they are typically descriptive
not prescriptive.",00:48:00.570,00:48:12.930
"So by that I mean, they describe
a situation, they",00:48:12.930,00:48:18.230
"don't tell you what
the answer is.",00:48:18.230,00:48:22.590
"So another way to think about
this is, a simulation is not",00:48:22.590,00:48:28.790
an optimization procedure.,00:48:28.790,00:48:31.370
"When we looked at optimization,
that was",00:48:31.370,00:48:35.180
prescriptive.,00:48:35.180,00:48:35.840
"We ran an optimization
algorithm, and it gave us the",00:48:35.840,00:48:41.280
best possible solution.,00:48:41.280,00:48:45.010
"A simulation typically doesn't
give you this best possible",00:48:45.010,00:48:48.420
"solution, but if you give it
the starting point, it will",00:48:48.420,00:48:53.150
"tell you the consequences
of that.",00:48:53.150,00:48:58.780
"Now, can we use simulation
to do optimization?",00:48:58.780,00:49:01.930
Absolutely.,00:49:01.930,00:49:03.780
"For example, we can use it
to do guess and check.",00:49:03.780,00:49:07.440
"Where we guess a, probably not
to get a truly optimal",00:49:07.440,00:49:10.510
"solution, but to get a good
solution, we can guess various",00:49:10.510,00:49:15.950
"possibilities, simulate
them, and see.",00:49:15.950,00:49:18.880
People do that all the time.,00:49:18.880,00:49:21.750
"If they want to see what's the
right number of checkout",00:49:21.750,00:49:27.120
"counters at the supermarket,
or what's the right airline",00:49:27.120,00:49:30.920
schedule to use?,00:49:30.920,00:49:32.540
"They'll make a guess, they'll
simulate it, and they'll say",00:49:32.540,00:49:35.803
"all right, this was better than
this, so we'll choose it.",00:49:35.803,00:49:39.980
"All right, I'm going
to stop here.",00:49:39.980,00:49:42.170
"Next time we're going to get
more deeply into the actual",00:49:42.170,00:49:45.920
"stochastics, the probability
distributions, and start",00:49:45.920,00:49:49.720
"understanding what's going
on under the covers.",00:49:49.720,00:49:52.580
