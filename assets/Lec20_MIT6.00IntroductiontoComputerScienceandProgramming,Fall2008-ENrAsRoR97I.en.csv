"PROFESSOR: All right, so today
we're returning to",00:00:19.570,00:00:23.360
simulations.,00:00:23.360,00:00:25.510
"And I'm going to do at first, a
little bit more abstractly,",00:00:25.510,00:00:29.910
"and then come back
to some details.",00:00:29.910,00:00:32.550
"So they're different ways to
classify simulation models.",00:00:32.550,00:00:38.310
"The first is whether it's
stochastic or deterministic.",00:00:38.310,00:00:53.570
"And the difference here is in
a deterministic simulation,",00:00:53.570,00:00:57.400
"you should get the same result
every time you run it.",00:00:57.400,00:01:04.170
"And there's a lot of uses we'll
see for deterministic",00:01:04.170,00:01:06.880
simulations.,00:01:06.880,00:01:08.880
"And then there's stochastic
simulations, where the answer",00:01:08.880,00:01:14.030
"will differ from run to run
because there's an element of",00:01:14.030,00:01:17.720
randomness in it.,00:01:17.720,00:01:20.500
"So here if you run it again
and again you get the same",00:01:20.500,00:01:23.030
"outcome every time,
here you may not.",00:01:23.030,00:01:29.310
"So, for example, the problem
set that's due today -- is",00:01:29.310,00:01:35.830
"that a stochastic or
deterministic simulation?",00:01:35.830,00:01:40.740
Somebody?,00:01:40.740,00:01:42.940
"Stochastic, exactly.",00:01:42.940,00:01:45.740
"And that's what we're going
to focus on in this class,",00:01:45.740,00:01:49.200
"because one of the interesting
questions we'll see about",00:01:49.200,00:01:51.990
"stochastic simulations is, how
often do have to run them",00:01:51.990,00:01:58.160
before you believe the answer?,00:01:58.160,00:02:00.990
"And that turns out to be
a very important issue.",00:02:00.990,00:02:03.940
"You run it once, you get
an answer, you can't",00:02:03.940,00:02:05.960
take it to the bank.,00:02:05.960,00:02:07.740
"Because the next time you run
it, you may get a completely",00:02:07.740,00:02:09.850
different answer.,00:02:09.850,00:02:11.250
"So that will get us a little
bit into the whole issue of",00:02:11.250,00:02:15.250
statistical analysis.,00:02:15.250,00:02:19.130
"Another interesting dichotomy
is static vs dynamic.",00:02:19.130,00:02:31.180
"We'll look at both, but
will spend more",00:02:31.180,00:02:33.810
time on dynamic models.,00:02:33.810,00:02:37.640
"So the issue -- it's
not my phone.",00:02:37.640,00:02:43.340
"If it's your mother, you could
feel free to take it,",00:02:43.340,00:02:45.340
otherwise --,00:02:45.340,00:02:48.150
"OK, no problem.",00:02:48.150,00:02:50.600
Inevitable.,00:02:50.600,00:02:54.090
"In a dynamic situation,
time plays a role.",00:02:54.090,00:02:57.640
"And you look at how things
evolve over time.",00:02:57.640,00:03:00.900
"In a static simulation, there
is no issue with time.",00:03:00.900,00:03:07.950
"We'll be looking at both, but
most of the time we'll be",00:03:07.950,00:03:11.700
focusing on dynamic ones.,00:03:11.700,00:03:15.990
"So an example of this kind of
thing would be a queuing",00:03:15.990,00:03:20.060
network model.,00:03:20.060,00:03:24.930
"This is one of the most popular
and important kinds of",00:03:24.930,00:03:27.630
dynamic simulations.,00:03:27.630,00:03:31.250
"Where you try and look at how
queues, a fancy word for",00:03:31.250,00:03:36.680
"lines, evolve over time.",00:03:36.680,00:03:40.580
"So for example, people who are
trying to decide how many",00:03:40.580,00:03:44.320
"lanes should be in a highway,
or how far apart the exits",00:03:44.320,00:03:47.970
"should be, or what should the
ratio of Fast Lane tolls to",00:03:47.970,00:03:52.390
"manually staffed tolls
should be.",00:03:52.390,00:03:54.650
"All use queuing networks to try
and answer that question.",00:03:54.650,00:04:00.240
"And we'll look at some examples
of these later",00:04:00.240,00:04:02.230
"because they are
very important.",00:04:02.230,00:04:04.450
"Particularly for things
related to",00:04:04.450,00:04:06.080
scheduling and planning.,00:04:06.080,00:04:10.440
"A third dichotomy is discrete
vs continuous.",00:04:10.440,00:04:26.790
"Imagine, for example, trying to
analyze the flow of traffic",00:04:26.790,00:04:32.590
along the highway.,00:04:32.590,00:04:35.590
"One way to do it, is to try and
have a simulation which",00:04:35.590,00:04:40.020
models each vehicle.,00:04:40.020,00:04:43.950
"That would be a discrete
simulation, because you've got",00:04:43.950,00:04:46.070
different parts.,00:04:46.070,00:04:47.800
"Alternatively, you might decide
to treat traffic as a",00:04:47.800,00:04:52.490
"flow, kind of like water flowing
through things, where",00:04:52.490,00:04:56.970
"changes in the flow can
be described by",00:04:56.970,00:04:59.410
differential equations.,00:04:59.410,00:05:01.910
"That would lead to a
continuous model.",00:05:01.910,00:05:08.020
"Another example is, a lot of
effort has gone into analyzing",00:05:08.020,00:05:13.560
"the way blood flows through
the human body.",00:05:13.560,00:05:18.090
"You can try and model it
discretely, where you take",00:05:18.090,00:05:22.250
"each red blood cell, each white
blood cell, and look at",00:05:22.250,00:05:27.060
"how they move, or simulate
how they move.",00:05:27.060,00:05:30.770
"Or you could treat it
continuously and say, well,",00:05:30.770,00:05:33.280
"we're just going to treat blood
as a fluid, not made up",00:05:33.280,00:05:36.990
"of discrete components, and
write some equations to model",00:05:36.990,00:05:41.190
"how that fluid goes through
and then simulate that.",00:05:41.190,00:05:45.630
"In this course, we're going to
be focusing mostly on discrete",00:05:45.630,00:05:51.300
simulations.,00:05:51.300,00:05:56.610
"Now if we think about the random
walk we looked at,",00:05:56.610,00:05:59.230
"indeed it was stochastic,
dynamic, and discrete.",00:05:59.230,00:06:10.350
"The random walk was an example
of what's called a Monte Carlo",00:06:10.350,00:06:15.770
simulation.,00:06:15.770,00:06:21.520
This term was coined there.,00:06:21.520,00:06:28.240
Anyone know what that is?,00:06:28.240,00:06:32.450
Anyone want to guess?,00:06:32.450,00:06:34.170
"It's the casino, in Monaco,
in Monte Carlo.",00:06:34.170,00:06:39.530
"It was at one time, before there
was even a Las Vegas,",00:06:39.530,00:06:43.060
"the most famous casino in
the world certainly.",00:06:43.060,00:06:47.090
"Still one of the more opulent
ones as you can see.",00:06:47.090,00:06:50.060
"And unlike Las Vegas, it's real
opulence, as opposed to",00:06:50.060,00:06:53.560
faux opulence.,00:06:53.560,00:06:57.090
"And this term Monte Carlo
simulation, was coined by Ulam",00:06:57.090,00:07:01.680
"and Metropolis, two
mathematicians, back in 1949,",00:07:01.680,00:07:07.010
"in reference to the fact that at
Monte Carlos, people bet on",00:07:07.010,00:07:10.050
"roulette wheels, and cards on
a table, games of chance,",00:07:10.050,00:07:15.480
"where there was randomness, and
things are discrete, in",00:07:15.480,00:07:19.500
some sense.,00:07:19.500,00:07:20.120
"And they decided, well, this is
just like gambling, and so",00:07:20.120,00:07:23.400
"they called them Monte
Carlos simulations.",00:07:23.400,00:07:28.370
"What Is it that makes
this approach work?",00:07:28.370,00:07:33.820
"And, in some sense, I won't go
into a lot of the math, but I",00:07:33.820,00:07:40.430
"would like to get some
concepts across.",00:07:40.430,00:07:44.470
"This is an application of what
are called inferential",00:07:44.470,00:07:47.130
statistics.,00:07:47.130,00:07:50.960
"You have some sample size, some
number of points, and",00:07:50.960,00:07:55.500
"from that you try to infer
something more general.",00:07:55.500,00:08:00.860
"We always depend upon one
property when we do this.",00:08:00.860,00:08:06.230
"And that property is that, a
randomly chosen sample tends",00:08:06.230,00:08:18.990
"to exhibit the same properties
as the population from which",00:08:18.990,00:08:44.360
it is drawn.,00:08:44.360,00:08:55.600
"So you take a population of
anything, red balls and black",00:08:55.600,00:08:59.360
"balls, or students, or steps,
and at random draw some",00:08:59.360,00:09:06.020
"sample, and you assume that
that sample has properties",00:09:06.020,00:09:11.940
"similar to the entire
population.",00:09:11.940,00:09:17.480
"So if I were to go around this
room and choose some random",00:09:17.480,00:09:23.750
"sample of you guys and write
down your hair color, we would",00:09:23.750,00:09:32.220
"be assuming that the fraction
of you with blonde hair in",00:09:32.220,00:09:35.730
"that sample would be the same
as the fraction of you with",00:09:35.730,00:09:39.330
"blonde hair in the
whole class.",00:09:39.330,00:09:42.480
"That's kind of what
this means.",00:09:42.480,00:09:44.510
"And the same would be true of
black hair, auburn hair, etc.",00:09:44.510,00:09:50.550
"So consider, for example,
flipping a coin.",00:09:50.550,00:09:57.360
"And if I were to flip it some
number of times, say 100",00:09:57.360,00:10:03.020
"times, you might be able to,
from the proportion of heads",00:10:03.020,00:10:09.780
"and tails, be able to
infer whether or not",00:10:09.780,00:10:13.380
the coin was fair.,00:10:13.380,00:10:15.230
"That is to say, half the times
it would be heads, in half the",00:10:15.230,00:10:17.700
"times it would be that tails, or
whether it was unfair, that",00:10:17.700,00:10:21.460
"it was somehow weighted, so that
heads would come up more",00:10:21.460,00:10:24.450
than tails.,00:10:24.450,00:10:26.160
"And you might say if we did this
100 times and looked at",00:10:26.160,00:10:28.800
"the results, then we could make
a decision about what",00:10:28.800,00:10:33.660
"would happen in general when
we looked at the coin.",00:10:33.660,00:10:37.130
"So let's look in an example
of doing that.",00:10:37.130,00:10:45.830
"So I wrote a little program,
it's on your",00:10:45.830,00:10:48.880
"handout, to flip a coin.",00:10:48.880,00:10:54.540
"So this looks like
the simulations",00:10:54.540,00:10:56.210
we looked at before.,00:10:56.210,00:10:58.370
"I've got flip trials, which says
that the number of heads",00:10:58.370,00:11:02.400
"and tails is 0 for
i in x range.",00:11:02.400,00:11:07.320
What is x range?,00:11:07.320,00:11:09.690
"So normally you would have
written, for i in range zero",00:11:09.690,00:11:13.410
to num flips.,00:11:13.410,00:11:16.580
"What range does, is it creates a
list, in this case from 0 to",00:11:16.580,00:11:21.570
"99 and goes through the
list of one at a time.",00:11:21.570,00:11:27.420
"That's fine, but supposed num
flips were a billion.",00:11:27.420,00:11:34.150
"Well, range would create
a list with a",00:11:34.150,00:11:36.280
billion numbers in it.,00:11:36.280,00:11:39.090
"Which would take a lot of
space in the computer.",00:11:39.090,00:11:42.190
And it's kind of wasted.,00:11:42.190,00:11:44.980
"What x range says is, don't
bother creating the list just",00:11:44.980,00:11:50.630
"go through the, in this case,
the numbers one at a time.",00:11:50.630,00:11:54.440
"So it's much more efficient
than range.",00:11:54.440,00:11:58.890
"It will behave the same way as
far as the answers you get,",00:11:58.890,00:12:03.260
"but it doesn't use
as much space.",00:12:03.260,00:12:06.480
"And since some of the
simulations we'll be doing",00:12:06.480,00:12:09.270
"will have lots of trials, or
lots of flips, it's worth the",00:12:09.270,00:12:13.160
"trouble to use x range
instead of range.",00:12:13.160,00:12:15.730
Yeah?,00:12:15.730,00:12:19.180
Pardon?,00:12:19.180,00:12:23.870
"STUDENT: Like, why would
we ever use range",00:12:23.870,00:12:25.588
instead of x range?,00:12:25.588,00:12:26.210
"PROFESSOR: No good reason, when
dealing with numbers,",00:12:26.210,00:12:28.530

"Certainly deserving of
a piece of candy.",00:12:55.210,00:13:03.010

coin is equal some",00:13:03.010,00:13:06.610

heads, else tails.",00:13:08.950,00:13:13.910

other on the x-axis.,00:15:08.130,00:15:10.920
"And so we what we could see
out of my 100 trials,",00:15:10.920,00:15:14.310
"somewhere around 22 of them
came out the same,",00:15:14.310,00:15:20.140
close to the same.,00:15:20.140,00:15:21.410
"But way over here we've
got some funny ones.",00:15:21.410,00:15:25.900
"100 and there was a
difference of 25.",00:15:25.900,00:15:28.810
Pretty big difference.,00:15:28.810,00:15:31.070
"Another way to look at the same
data, and I'm doing this",00:15:31.070,00:15:34.890
"just to show that there are
different ways of looking at",00:15:34.890,00:15:37.180
"data, is here, what I've plotted
is each trial, the",00:15:37.180,00:15:46.650
percent difference.,00:15:46.650,00:15:49.900
So out of 100 flips.,00:15:49.900,00:15:51.400
"And this is normalizing it,
because if I flip a million",00:15:51.400,00:15:54.830
"coins, I might expect the
difference to be pretty big in",00:15:54.830,00:15:59.190
"absolute terms, but maybe
very small as a",00:15:59.190,00:16:01.420
percentage of a million.,00:16:01.420,00:16:04.790
"And so here, we can again see
that as these stochastic kinds",00:16:04.790,00:16:08.900
"of things, there's a pretty
big difference, right?",00:16:08.900,00:16:12.020
"We've got one where it was over
25 percent, and several",00:16:12.020,00:16:17.680
where it's zero.,00:16:17.680,00:16:20.290
"So the point here, we can see
from this graph, that if I'd",00:16:20.290,00:16:24.030
"done only one trial and just
assumed that was the answer as",00:16:24.030,00:16:28.260
"to whether my coin was weighted
or not, I could",00:16:28.260,00:16:31.040
really have fooled myself.,00:16:31.040,00:16:35.100
"So the the main point is that
you need to be careful when",00:16:35.100,00:16:40.600
"you're doing these
kinds of things.",00:16:40.600,00:16:44.520
"And this green line
here is the mean.",00:16:44.520,00:16:48.310
"So it says on average, the
difference was seven precent.",00:16:48.310,00:16:54.740
"Well suppose, maybe, instead
of, flipping 100, I were to",00:16:54.740,00:17:14.750
"flip 1,000.",00:17:14.750,00:17:42.480
"Well, doesn't seem to
want to notice it.",00:17:42.480,00:17:44.990
"One more try and then I'll
just restart it, which is",00:17:44.990,00:17:48.560
"always the safest thing as
we've discussed before.",00:17:48.560,00:18:07.250
"Well, we won't panic.",00:18:07.250,00:18:14.760
Sometimes this helps.,00:18:14.760,00:18:20.830
"If not, here we go.",00:18:20.830,00:18:26.820
"So let's say we wanted
to flip 1,000 coins.",00:18:26.820,00:18:29.890
So now what do we think?,00:18:29.890,00:18:33.880
"Is the difference going to be
bigger or smaller than when we",00:18:33.880,00:18:36.920
flipped 100?,00:18:36.920,00:18:37.620
"Is the average difference
between heads and tails bigger",00:18:37.620,00:18:42.750
"or smaller with 1,000 flips
than with 100 flips?",00:18:42.750,00:18:48.950
"Well, the percentage will be
smaller, but in absolute",00:18:48.950,00:18:51.930
"terms, it's probably going
to be bigger, right?",00:18:51.930,00:18:55.970
"Because I've got more
chances to stray.",00:18:55.970,00:19:01.750
But we'll find out.,00:19:01.750,00:19:17.890
"So here we see that the mean
difference is somewhere in the",00:19:17.890,00:19:22.930
"twenties, which was much
higher than the mean",00:19:22.930,00:19:25.670
difference for 100 flips.,00:19:25.670,00:19:28.370
"On the other hand, if we look at
the percentage, we see it's",00:19:28.370,00:19:31.920
much lower.,00:19:31.920,00:19:32.560
"Instead of seven percent, it's
around two and a half percent",00:19:32.560,00:19:34.770
in the main.,00:19:34.770,00:19:37.710
"There's something else
interesting to observe in",00:19:37.710,00:19:40.160
"figure two, relative to when we
looked at with 100 flips.",00:19:40.160,00:19:44.860
"What else is pretty interesting
about the",00:19:44.860,00:19:46.500
"difference between these two
figures, if you can remember",00:19:46.500,00:19:49.620
the other one?,00:19:49.620,00:19:52.460
Yeah?,00:19:52.460,00:19:52.820
STUDENT: There are no zeros?,00:19:52.820,00:19:54.500
PROFESSOR: There are no zeros.,00:19:54.500,00:19:57.850
"That's right, as it happens
there were no zeros.",00:19:57.850,00:20:04.660
"Not so surprising that it
didn't ever come out",00:20:04.660,00:20:07.290
"exactly 500, 500.",00:20:07.290,00:20:10.560
What else?,00:20:10.560,00:20:14.420
"What was the biggest difference,
percentage-wise,",00:20:14.420,00:20:16.810
we saw last time?,00:20:16.810,00:20:19.030
Over 25.,00:20:19.030,00:20:20.930
"So notice how much narrower
the range is here.",00:20:20.930,00:20:24.940
"Instead of ranging from 2 to 25
or something like that, it",00:20:24.940,00:20:29.480
"ranges from 0 to 7, or
maybe 7 and a little.",00:20:29.480,00:20:35.620
"So, by flipping more coins, the
experiment becomes more",00:20:35.620,00:20:41.400
reproduce-able.,00:20:41.400,00:20:43.800
"I'm looks like the same because
of scaling, but in",00:20:43.800,00:20:49.450
"fact the range is
much narrower.",00:20:49.450,00:20:52.630
"Each experiment tends to give
an answer closer to all the",00:20:52.630,00:20:57.200
other experiments.,00:20:57.200,00:21:01.280
That's a good thing.,00:21:01.280,00:21:03.230
"It should give you confidence
that the answers are getting",00:21:03.230,00:21:08.300
pretty close to right.,00:21:08.300,00:21:10.900
"That they're not bouncing
all over the place.",00:21:10.900,00:21:13.810
"And if I were to flip a million
coins, we would find",00:21:13.810,00:21:17.360
"the range would get
very tight.",00:21:17.360,00:21:22.010
"So notice that even though
there's similar information in",00:21:22.010,00:21:24.810
"the histogram and the plot,
different things leap out at",00:21:24.810,00:21:30.380
"you, as you look at it.",00:21:30.380,00:21:36.790
"All right, we could ask a lot of
other interesting questions",00:21:36.790,00:21:41.240
about coins here.,00:21:41.240,00:21:46.460
"But, we'll come back to this in
a minute and look at some",00:21:46.460,00:21:49.080
other questions.,00:21:49.080,00:21:52.030
"I want to talk again a little
bit more generally.",00:21:52.030,00:21:56.390
"It's kind of easy to think about
running a simulation to",00:21:56.390,00:21:59.370
predict the future.,00:21:59.370,00:22:01.770
"So in some sense, we look at
this, and this predicts what",00:22:01.770,00:22:06.730
"might happen if I flipped
1,000 coins.",00:22:06.730,00:22:10.680
"That the most likely event
would be that I'd have",00:22:10.680,00:22:16.620
"something under 10 in the
difference between heads and",00:22:16.620,00:22:24.910
"tails, but that it's not
terribly unlikely that I might",00:22:24.910,00:22:28.680
"have close to 70 as
a difference.",00:22:28.680,00:22:34.730
"And if I ran more than 100
trials I'd see more, but this",00:22:34.730,00:22:38.090
"helps me predict what
might happen.",00:22:38.090,00:22:42.660
"Now we don't always use
simulations to predict what",00:22:42.660,00:22:47.150
might happen.,00:22:47.150,00:22:47.960
"We sometimes actually use
simulations to understand the",00:22:47.960,00:22:52.690
current state of the world.,00:22:52.690,00:22:54.540
"So for example, if I told you
that we are going to flip",00:22:54.540,00:22:59.460
"three coins, and I wanted you
to predict the probability",00:22:59.460,00:23:06.930
"that all three would be
either heads, or all",00:23:06.930,00:23:09.960
three would be tails.,00:23:09.960,00:23:12.050
"Well, if you'd studied any
probability, you could know",00:23:12.050,00:23:14.410
how to do that.,00:23:14.410,00:23:15.990
"If you hadn't studied
probability, you would say,",00:23:15.990,00:23:18.770
"well, that's OK, we have a
simulation right here.",00:23:18.770,00:23:22.210
Let's just do it.,00:23:22.210,00:23:27.170
Here we go again.,00:23:27.170,00:23:45.360
And so let's try it.,00:23:45.360,00:23:46.670
"Let's flip three coins, and
let's do it 4,000 times here.",00:23:46.670,00:24:06.160
"Well, that's kind
of hard to read.",00:24:06.160,00:24:07.630
It's pretty dense.,00:24:07.630,00:24:09.720
"But we can see that the
mean here is 50.",00:24:09.720,00:24:19.260
"And, this is a little
easier to read.",00:24:19.260,00:24:24.630
"This tells us that, how many
times will the difference,",00:24:24.630,00:24:31.580
"right, be zero 3,000
out of 4,000.",00:24:31.580,00:24:38.200
Is that right?,00:24:38.200,00:24:39.920
What do you think?,00:24:39.920,00:24:41.020
Do you believe this?,00:24:41.020,00:24:42.050
"Have I done the right thing?
three coins, 4,000 flips, how",00:24:42.050,00:24:47.140
"often should they all be heads,
or how often should",00:24:47.140,00:24:49.280
they all be tails?,00:24:49.280,00:24:54.000
What does this tell us?,00:24:54.000,00:24:54.840
"It tells us one-fourth of the
time they'll all be-- the",00:24:54.840,00:25:01.150
"difference between, wait a
minute, how can the difference",00:25:01.150,00:25:03.920
"between -- something's wrong
with my code, right?",00:25:03.920,00:25:09.610
"Because I only have two
possible values.",00:25:09.610,00:25:11.800
I hadn't expected this.,00:25:11.800,00:25:17.110
"I obviously messed
something up.",00:25:17.110,00:25:20.690
Pardon?,00:25:20.690,00:25:21.000
STUDENT: It's right.,00:25:21.000,00:25:22.770
"PROFESSOR: It's right,
because?",00:25:22.770,00:25:24.050
"STUDENT: Because you had an odd
number of flips, and when",00:25:24.050,00:25:28.992
you split them --,00:25:28.992,00:25:29.360
PROFESSOR: Pardon?,00:25:29.360,00:25:29.720
"STUDENT: When you split
an odd number --",00:25:29.720,00:25:32.070
PROFESSOR: Exactly.,00:25:32.070,00:25:35.070
So it is correct.,00:25:35.070,00:25:36.380
And it gives us what we want.,00:25:36.380,00:25:37.860
"But now, let's think about
a different situation.",00:25:37.860,00:25:41.150
Anybody got a coin here?,00:25:41.150,00:25:42.420
Anyone give me three coins?,00:25:42.420,00:25:46.670
"I can trust somebody, I hope.",00:25:46.670,00:25:55.100
"What a cheap -- anybody got
silver dollars, would be",00:25:55.100,00:25:57.160
preferable?,00:25:57.160,00:25:59.420
"All right, look at this.",00:25:59.420,00:26:01.470
"She's very carefully given
me three pennies.",00:26:01.470,00:26:06.640
"She had big, big money in that
purse, too, but she didn't",00:26:06.640,00:26:09.710
want me to have it.,00:26:09.710,00:26:11.120
"All right, so I'm going to
take these three pennies,",00:26:11.120,00:26:15.140
"jiggle them up, and now ask you,
what's the probability",00:26:15.140,00:26:19.440
"that all three of
them are heads?",00:26:19.440,00:26:24.290
Anyone want to tell me?,00:26:24.290,00:26:26.770
"It's either 0 or 1, right?",00:26:26.770,00:26:30.180
"And I can actually look
at you and tell you",00:26:30.180,00:26:32.050
exactly which it is.,00:26:32.050,00:26:33.890
And you can't see which it is.,00:26:33.890,00:26:38.420
"So, how should you think about
what the probability it?",00:26:38.420,00:26:43.070
"Well, you might as well assume
that it's whatever this graph",00:26:43.070,00:26:48.960
tells you it is.,00:26:48.960,00:26:52.810
"Because the fact that you
don't have access to the",00:26:52.810,00:26:55.730
"information, means that you
really might as well treat the",00:26:55.730,00:26:59.570
present as if it's the future.,00:26:59.570,00:27:02.250
That it's unknown.,00:27:02.250,00:27:04.400
"And so in fact we frequently,
when there's data out there",00:27:04.400,00:27:08.950
"that we don't have access to,
we use simulations and",00:27:08.950,00:27:13.420
"probabilities to estimate, make
our best guess, about the",00:27:13.420,00:27:17.570
current state of the world.,00:27:17.570,00:27:20.690
"And so, in fact, guessing the
value of the current state, is",00:27:20.690,00:27:24.670
"really no different from
predicting the value of a",00:27:24.670,00:27:27.900
"future state when you don't
have the information.",00:27:27.900,00:27:34.230
"In general, all right, now,
just to show that your",00:27:34.230,00:27:40.530
precautions were unnecessary.,00:27:40.530,00:27:52.860
Where was I?,00:27:52.860,00:27:55.170
Right.,00:27:55.170,00:27:57.660
"In general, when we're trying
to predict the future, or in",00:27:57.660,00:28:05.470
"this case, guess the present, we
have to use information we",00:28:05.470,00:28:09.850
"already have to make our
prediction or our best guess.",00:28:09.850,00:28:17.100
"So to do that, we have to always
ask the question, is",00:28:17.100,00:28:21.590
"past behavior a good prediction
of future behavior?",00:28:21.590,00:28:28.860
"So if I flip a coin 1,000 times
and count up the heads",00:28:28.860,00:28:32.095
"and tails, is that a good
prediction what will happen",00:28:32.095,00:28:35.230
the next time?,00:28:35.230,00:28:39.720
"This is a step people often
omit, in doing these",00:28:39.720,00:28:44.010
predictions.,00:28:44.010,00:28:46.360
"See the recent meltdown of
the financial system.",00:28:46.360,00:28:49.430
"Where people had lots of
stochastic simulations",00:28:49.430,00:28:52.910
"predicting what the market would
do, and they were all",00:28:52.910,00:28:55.040
"wrong, because they were all
based upon assuming samples",00:28:55.040,00:28:58.640
"drawn from the past would
predict the future.",00:28:58.640,00:29:02.660
"So, as we build these models,
that's the question you always",00:29:02.660,00:29:06.270
have to ask yourself.,00:29:06.270,00:29:08.840
"Is, in some sense, this true?",00:29:08.840,00:29:14.770
"Because usually what we're doing
is, we're choosing a",00:29:14.770,00:29:17.810
"random sample from the
past and hoping it",00:29:17.810,00:29:21.130
predicts the future.,00:29:21.130,00:29:24.960
"And that is to say, is the
population we have available",00:29:24.960,00:29:27.700
"the same has the one
in the future.",00:29:27.700,00:29:31.620
"So it's easy to see how one
might use these kinds of",00:29:31.620,00:29:34.620
"simulations to figure out things
that are inherently",00:29:34.620,00:29:39.570

heard of this.",00:30:37.770,00:30:41.900

literally, people have known",00:30:41.900,00:30:45.140

equals the area.",00:30:51.390,00:30:59.820

the diameter is equal to",00:30:59.820,00:31:03.160
the circumference.,00:31:03.160,00:31:08.740
"So, back in the days of the
Egyptian pharaohs, it was",00:31:08.740,00:31:13.120
"known that such a constant
existed.",00:31:13.120,00:31:15.870
"In fact, it didn't acquire
the name pi",00:31:15.870,00:31:17.910
until the 18th century.,00:31:17.910,00:31:20.260
"And so they called it
other things, but",00:31:20.260,00:31:22.500
they knew it existed.,00:31:22.500,00:31:26.660
"And for thousands of years,
people have speculated on what",00:31:26.660,00:31:30.130
it's value was.,00:31:30.130,00:31:32.460
"Sometime around 1650 BC, the
Egyptians said that pi was",00:31:32.460,00:31:42.530
"3.16, something called
the Rhind Papyrus,",00:31:42.530,00:31:46.850
something they found.,00:31:46.850,00:31:52.230
"Many years later, about
1,000 years later, the",00:31:52.230,00:31:56.620
Bible said pi was three.,00:31:56.620,00:32:04.540
"And I quote, this is describing
the specifications",00:32:04.540,00:32:11.450
"for the Great Temple of Solomon.
""He made a molten sea",00:32:11.450,00:32:15.170

round in compass, and 5",00:32:15.170,00:32:19.720
"cubit the height thereof, and
a line of 30 cubits did",00:32:19.720,00:32:23.800
"compass it round about."" So, all
right, so what we've got",00:32:23.800,00:32:29.780
"here is, we've got everything
we need to plug into these",00:32:29.780,00:32:32.070

one place in the Bible.",00:32:37.070,00:32:42.300
"I will not comment on the
theological implications of",00:32:42.300,00:32:46.440
this assertion.,00:32:46.440,00:32:49.960
Sarah Palin might.,00:32:49.960,00:32:52.030
"And Mike Huckabee
certainly would.",00:32:52.030,00:32:55.330
"The first theoretical
calculation of pi was carried",00:32:55.330,00:33:00.790
"out by Archimedes, a great
Greek mathematician from",00:33:00.790,00:33:05.820
"Syracuse, that was about
somewhere around 250 BC.",00:33:05.820,00:33:11.150
"And he said that pi was
somewhere between 223 divided",00:33:11.150,00:33:19.040
"by 71, and 22 divided by 7.",00:33:19.040,00:33:31.190
This was amazingly profound.,00:33:31.190,00:33:34.550
"He knew he didn't know what the
answer was, but he had a",00:33:34.550,00:33:39.340
"way to give an upper and a lower
bound, and say it was",00:33:39.340,00:33:42.030
"somewhere between these
two values.",00:33:42.030,00:33:45.190
"And in fact if you calculate it,
the average of those two",00:33:45.190,00:33:50.630
values is 3.1418.,00:33:50.630,00:33:56.210
Not bad for the time.,00:33:56.210,00:33:58.830
"This was not by measurement,
he actually had a very",00:33:58.830,00:34:00.880
"interesting way of
calculating it.",00:34:00.880,00:34:04.750
"All right, so this is where it
stood, for years and years,",00:34:04.750,00:34:09.260
"because of course people forgot
the Rhind Papyrus, and",00:34:09.260,00:34:12.200
"they forgot Archimedes, and they
believed the Bible, and",00:34:12.200,00:34:15.250
"so three was used
for a long time.",00:34:15.250,00:34:19.040
"People sort of knew it wasn't
right, but still.",00:34:19.040,00:34:23.710
"Then quite interestingly, Buffon
and Laplace, two great",00:34:23.710,00:34:33.170
"French mathematicians, actually
people had better",00:34:33.170,00:34:36.580
"estimates using Archimedes'
methods long before they came",00:34:36.580,00:34:39.690
"along, proposed a way to do
it using a simulation.",00:34:39.690,00:34:45.780
"Now, since Laplace lived between
1749 and 1827, it was",00:34:45.780,00:34:52.580
not a computer simulation.,00:34:52.580,00:34:56.240
"So I'm going to show you,
basically, the way that he",00:34:56.240,00:34:59.010
"proposed to do it. the basic
idea was you take a square,",00:34:59.010,00:35:08.150
"assume that's a square, and you
inscribe in it a quarter",00:35:08.150,00:35:12.410
of a circle.,00:35:12.410,00:35:16.060
"So here, you have the radius
of the square r.",00:35:16.060,00:35:23.870
"And then you get some person to,
he used needles, but I'm",00:35:23.870,00:35:31.490
"going to use darts, to throw
darts at the shape.",00:35:31.490,00:35:37.130
"And some number of the darts
will land in the circle part,",00:35:37.130,00:35:44.520
"and some number of the darts
will land out here, in the",00:35:44.520,00:35:48.960
"part of the square that's not
inscribed by the circle.",00:35:48.960,00:35:55.610
"And then we can look at the
ratio of the darts in the",00:35:55.610,00:36:02.260
"shaded area divided by
the total number of",00:36:02.260,00:36:10.560
darts in the square.,00:36:10.560,00:36:16.900
"And that's equal to the shaded
area divided by the area of",00:36:16.900,00:36:27.220
the square.,00:36:27.220,00:36:31.070
"The notion being, if they're
landing at random in these",00:36:31.070,00:36:34.800
"places, the proportion here and
not here will depend upon",00:36:34.800,00:36:41.460
the relative areas.,00:36:41.460,00:36:44.540
"And that certainly
makes sense.",00:36:44.540,00:36:45.870
"If this were half the area of
the square, then you'd expect",00:36:45.870,00:36:49.780
"half the darts to
land in here.",00:36:49.780,00:36:55.130
"And then as you can see in your
handout, a little simple",00:36:55.130,00:36:58.970
"algebra can take this, plus pi r
squared equals the area, you",00:36:58.970,00:37:09.000
"can solve for pi, and you can
get that pi is equal to 4, and",00:37:09.000,00:37:16.180
"I'll write it, h, where h is
the hit ratio, the number",00:37:16.180,00:37:20.210
falling in here.,00:37:20.210,00:37:22.810
"So people sort of see why that
should work intuitively?",00:37:22.810,00:37:27.330
"And that it's a very clever idea
to use randomness to find",00:37:27.330,00:37:31.660
"a value that there's nothing
random about.",00:37:31.660,00:37:34.090
"So we can now do
the experiment.",00:37:34.090,00:37:36.570
"I need volunteers
to throw darts.",00:37:36.570,00:37:42.330
Come on.,00:37:42.330,00:37:44.100
Come on up.,00:37:44.100,00:37:48.500
I need more volunteers.,00:37:48.500,00:37:50.360
I have a lot of darts.,00:37:50.360,00:37:51.360
Anybody else?,00:37:51.360,00:37:56.230
Anybody?,00:37:56.230,00:37:58.130
"All right, then since you're
all in the front",00:37:58.130,00:38:00.270
"row, you get stuck.",00:38:00.270,00:38:07.330
So now we'll try it.,00:38:07.330,00:38:11.180
"And you guys, we'll see how many
of you hit in the circle,",00:38:11.180,00:38:14.780
and how many of you hit there.,00:38:14.780,00:38:20.910
"Go ahead, on the count of
3, everybody throw.",00:38:20.910,00:38:24.160
"1, 2, 3.",00:38:24.160,00:38:28.350
Ohh!,00:38:28.350,00:38:30.880
He did that on purpose.,00:38:30.880,00:38:34.220
"You'll notice Professor Grimson
isn't here today, and",00:38:34.220,00:38:36.450
"that's because I told him he was
going to have to hold the",00:38:36.450,00:38:38.240
dart board.,00:38:38.240,00:38:41.240
"Well, what we see here is, we
ignore the ones that missed",00:38:41.240,00:38:47.680
all together.,00:38:47.680,00:38:49.890
"And we'll see that, truly,
I'm assuming",00:38:49.890,00:38:52.590
these are random throws.,00:38:52.590,00:38:54.180
We have one here and two here.,00:38:54.180,00:38:55.570
"Well, your eyes will tell you
that's the wrong ratio.",00:38:55.570,00:39:01.430
"Which suggests that having
students throw darts is not",00:39:01.430,00:39:04.660
"the best way to solve
this problem.",00:39:04.660,00:39:07.390
"And so you will see in your
handout a computer",00:39:07.390,00:39:09.770
simulation of it.,00:39:09.770,00:39:14.250
So let's look at that.,00:39:14.250,00:39:20.300
So this is find pi.,00:39:20.300,00:39:23.520
"So at the beginning of this
code, by the way, it's not on",00:39:23.520,00:39:26.380
"your handout, is some magic.",00:39:26.380,00:39:29.540
"I got tired of looking at big
numbers without commas",00:39:29.540,00:39:32.530
"separating the thousands
places.",00:39:32.530,00:39:34.910
"You've see me in other
lectures counting",00:39:34.910,00:39:36.440
the number of zeros.,00:39:36.440,00:39:38.920
"What we have here is, that just
tells it I have to have",00:39:38.920,00:39:43.630
"two versions, one for the
Mac, and one for the PC.",00:39:43.630,00:39:47.050
"To set some variables that had
to write integers, things in",00:39:47.050,00:39:51.070
"general, and I'm saying here, do
it the way you would do it",00:39:51.070,00:39:54.380
"in the United States
in English.",00:39:54.380,00:39:57.940
"And UTF8 is just an extended
character code.",00:39:57.940,00:40:00.530
"Anyway, you don't need to learn
anything about this",00:40:00.530,00:40:02.350
"magic, but it's just a handy
little way to make the numbers",00:40:02.350,00:40:05.930
easier to read.,00:40:05.930,00:40:09.290
"All right, so let's let's
try and look at it.",00:40:09.290,00:40:14.940
"There's not much interesting
to see here.",00:40:14.940,00:40:18.740
"I've done this little thing,
format ints, that uses this",00:40:18.740,00:40:21.680
"magic to say grouping equals
true, that means put a comma",00:40:21.680,00:40:25.910
in the thousand places.,00:40:25.910,00:40:27.990
"But again, you can
ignore all that.",00:40:27.990,00:40:29.470
"The interesting part, is that
from Pylab I import star,",00:40:29.470,00:40:37.860
import random in math.,00:40:37.860,00:40:39.640
"As some of you observed, the
order these imports matters.",00:40:39.640,00:40:42.730
"I think I sent out an email
yesterday explaining what was",00:40:42.730,00:40:45.970
going on here.,00:40:45.970,00:40:47.510
"This was one of the things
that I knew, and probably",00:40:47.510,00:40:49.880
should've mentioned.,00:40:49.880,00:40:51.120
"But since I knew it, I thought
everyone knew.",00:40:51.120,00:40:54.250
Silly me.,00:40:54.250,00:40:55.230
"It was of course a dumb
thing to think.",00:40:55.230,00:40:58.760
"And then I'm going to throw
a bunch of darts.",00:40:58.760,00:41:00.940
"The other thing you'll notice
is, throw darts has a",00:41:00.940,00:41:03.140
parameter called should plot.,00:41:03.140,00:41:05.910
"And that's because when I
throw a billion darts, I",00:41:05.910,00:41:09.370
"really don't want to try and
take the time to plot a",00:41:09.370,00:41:11.530
billion points.,00:41:11.530,00:41:13.420
"So let's first look at
a little example.",00:41:13.420,00:41:18.030
"We'll try throwing
10,000 darts.",00:41:18.030,00:41:32.090
"And it gives me an estimated
value of pi of 3.16.",00:41:32.090,00:41:38.640
"And what we'll see here, is
that the number of darts",00:41:38.640,00:41:44.370
"thrown, the estimate
changes, right?",00:41:44.370,00:41:46.660
"When I threw one dart, the
estimate of pi was 4.",00:41:46.660,00:41:52.780
"I threw my second dart, it
dropped all the way to 3.",00:41:52.780,00:41:56.780
"And then it bounced around a
while, and then at the end, it",00:41:56.780,00:41:59.450
"starts to really stabilize
around the true value.",00:41:59.450,00:42:03.420
"You'll notice, by the way, that
what I've got here is a",00:42:03.420,00:42:06.680
logarithmic x-axis.,00:42:06.680,00:42:08.420
"If you look at the code, you'll
see I've told it to be",00:42:08.420,00:42:11.620
semi log x.,00:42:11.620,00:42:13.710
"And that's because I wanted you
to be able to see what was",00:42:13.710,00:42:16.440
"happening early on, where
it was fluctuating.",00:42:16.440,00:42:19.460
"But out here it's kind of
boring, because the",00:42:19.460,00:42:21.490
fluctuations are so small.,00:42:21.490,00:42:23.970
"So that was a good
way to do it.",00:42:23.970,00:42:34.100
All right now.,00:42:34.100,00:42:37.020
"Do I think I have enough
samples here?",00:42:37.020,00:42:38.940
"Well, I don't want you to cheat
and look at the estimate",00:42:38.940,00:42:43.290
"and say no, you don't, because
you know that's",00:42:43.290,00:42:45.070
not the right answer.,00:42:45.070,00:42:46.740
"And, it's not even as good
as Archimedes did.",00:42:46.740,00:42:51.670
"But how could you sort of look
at the data, and get a sense",00:42:51.670,00:42:55.360
"that maybe this is not
the right answer?",00:42:55.360,00:42:58.580
"Well, even at the end, if we
look at it, it's still",00:42:58.580,00:43:01.720
wiggling around a fair amount.,00:43:01.720,00:43:03.390
We can zoom in.,00:43:03.390,00:43:12.050
"And it's bouncing up
and down here.",00:43:12.050,00:43:14.220
"I'm in a region, but it's sort
of makes us think that maybe",00:43:14.220,00:43:20.350
"it hasn't stabilized, right?",00:43:20.350,00:43:22.100
"You'd like it to not be
moving very much.",00:43:22.100,00:43:27.150
"Now, by the way, the other thing
we could've looked at,",00:43:27.150,00:43:31.080
"when we ran it, let's run
it again, probably get a",00:43:31.080,00:43:38.490
different answer by the way.,00:43:38.490,00:43:43.700
"Yeah, notice the different
answer here.",00:43:43.700,00:43:47.160
"Turns out to be a better answer,
but it's just an",00:43:47.160,00:43:49.020
"accident, right?",00:43:49.020,00:43:55.760
"Notice in the beginning it
fluctuates wildly, and it",00:43:55.760,00:43:59.270
"fluctuates less wildly
at the end.",00:43:59.270,00:44:01.810
Why is that?,00:44:01.810,00:44:04.850
"And don't just say because
it's close to right",00:44:04.850,00:44:06.545
and it knows it.,00:44:06.545,00:44:09.210
"Why do the mathematics of this,
in some sense, tell us",00:44:09.210,00:44:13.180
"it has to fluctuate less
wildly at the end?",00:44:13.180,00:44:16.450
Yes?,00:44:16.450,00:44:17.200
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:44:17.200,00:44:22.950
"PROFESSOR: Exactly,
exactly right.",00:44:22.950,00:44:27.100
"If I've only thrown two darts,
the third dart can have a big",00:44:27.100,00:44:30.130
"difference in the
average value.",00:44:30.130,00:44:33.110
"But if I've thrown a million
darts, the million and first",00:44:33.110,00:44:35.710
can't matter very much.,00:44:35.710,00:44:38.530
"And what this tells me is, as
I want ever more digits of",00:44:38.530,00:44:41.510
"precision, I have to run a lot
more trials to get there.",00:44:41.510,00:44:47.570
"And that's often true, that
simulations can get you in the",00:44:47.570,00:44:50.960
"neighborhood quickly, but the
more precision you want, the",00:44:50.960,00:44:55.180
"number of steps grows
quite quickly.",00:44:55.180,00:45:00.920
"Now, the fact that I got such
different answers the two",00:45:00.920,00:45:03.570
"times I ran this suggests
strongly that I shouldn't",00:45:03.570,00:45:08.000
believe either answer.,00:45:08.000,00:45:10.310
Right?,00:45:10.310,00:45:13.300
"So we need to do
something else.",00:45:13.300,00:45:17.300
So let's try something else.,00:45:17.300,00:45:30.890
"Let's try throwing a lot
more darts here,",00:45:30.890,00:45:32.760
and see what we get.,00:45:32.760,00:45:42.420
"Now if you look at my code,
you'll see I'm printing",00:45:42.420,00:45:44.780
intermediate values.,00:45:44.780,00:45:47.950
"Every million darts, I'm
printing the value.",00:45:47.950,00:45:50.700
"And I did that because the first
time I ran this on a big",00:45:50.700,00:45:53.890
"number, I was afraid I had an
infinite loop and my program",00:45:53.890,00:45:56.920
was not working.,00:45:56.920,00:45:58.570
"So I just said, all right, let's
put a print statement in",00:45:58.570,00:46:01.040
"the loop, so I could see that
it's making progress.",00:46:01.040,00:46:06.560
"And then I decided it was just
kind of nice to look at it, to",00:46:06.560,00:46:08.910
see what was going on here.,00:46:08.910,00:46:11.390
"So now you see that if I throw
10 million darts, I'm starting",00:46:11.390,00:46:15.970
to get a much better estimate.,00:46:15.970,00:46:18.500
"You'll also see, as predicted,
that as I get further out, the",00:46:18.500,00:46:22.580
"value of the estimate changes
less and less with each",00:46:22.580,00:46:26.300
"million new darts, because it's
a smaller fraction of the",00:46:26.300,00:46:29.590
total darts.,00:46:29.590,00:46:31.570
But it's getting a lot better.,00:46:31.570,00:46:36.000
Still not quite there.,00:46:36.000,00:46:40.650
"Let's just see what happens,
I can throw in another one.",00:46:40.650,00:46:47.190
"This is going to take
a little while.",00:46:47.190,00:46:51.230
"So I can talk while
it's running.",00:46:51.230,00:46:53.930
"Oops, what did I do here?",00:46:53.930,00:47:06.790
"So, it's going to keep on going
and going and going.",00:47:06.790,00:47:12.520
"And then if we were to run it
with this number of darts",00:47:12.520,00:47:15.520
"several times over, we would
discover that we got answers",00:47:15.520,00:47:18.950
"that were very, very similar.",00:47:18.950,00:47:22.040
"From that we can take comfort,
statistically, that we're",00:47:22.040,00:47:27.010
"really getting close to the
same answer every time, so",00:47:27.010,00:47:30.880
"we've probably thrown enough
darts to feel comfortable that",00:47:30.880,00:47:34.810
"we're doing what's statistically
the right thing.",00:47:34.810,00:47:39.580
"And that there maybe isn't
a lot of point in",00:47:39.580,00:47:41.650
throwing more darts.,00:47:41.650,00:47:43.750
"Does that mean that we have
the right answer?",00:47:43.750,00:47:48.120
"No, not necessarily, and that's
what we're going to",00:47:48.120,00:47:51.690
look at next week.,00:47:51.690,00:47:53.750
