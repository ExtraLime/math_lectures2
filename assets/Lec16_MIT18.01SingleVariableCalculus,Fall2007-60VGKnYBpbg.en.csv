"PROFESSOR: And this
last little bit",00:00:21.170,00:00:23.070
"is something which is
not yet on the Web.",00:00:23.070,00:00:24.902
"But, anyway, when I was
walking out of the room",00:00:24.902,00:00:26.860
"last time, I noticed
that I'd written down",00:00:26.860,00:00:29.740
the wrong formula for c_1 - c_2.,00:00:29.740,00:00:32.070
"There's a misprint, there's
a minus sign that's wrong.",00:00:32.070,00:00:35.380
"I claimed last time
that c_1 - c_2 was +1/2.",00:00:35.380,00:00:39.180
"But, actually, it's -1/2.",00:00:39.180,00:00:40.580
"If you go through
the calculation",00:00:40.580,00:00:42.080
"that we did with the
antiderivative of sin x cos x,",00:00:42.080,00:00:45.780
"we get these two
possible answers.",00:00:45.780,00:00:48.500
"And if they're to be equal,
then if we just subtract them",00:00:48.500,00:00:52.900
we get c_1 - c_2 + 1/2 = 0.,00:00:52.900,00:00:56.300
So c_1 - c_2 = 1/2.,00:00:56.300,00:01:01.740
"So, those are all
of the corrections.",00:01:01.740,00:01:03.930
"Again, everything here
will be on the Web.",00:01:03.930,00:01:06.530
"But just wanted to make
it all clear to you.",00:01:06.530,00:01:14.660
So here we are.,00:01:14.660,00:01:15.410
"This is our last day of the
second unit, Applications",00:01:15.410,00:01:19.900
of Differentiation.,00:01:19.900,00:01:22.010
"And I have one of the most fun
topics to introduce to you.",00:01:22.010,00:01:30.210
Which is differential equations.,00:01:30.210,00:01:32.530
"Now, we have a whole course
on differential equations,",00:01:32.530,00:01:35.410
which is called 18.03.,00:01:35.410,00:01:38.140
"And so we're only going
to do just a little bit.",00:01:38.140,00:01:43.840
"But I'm going to teach
you one technique.",00:01:43.840,00:01:52.600
"Which fits in precisely with
what we've been doing already.",00:01:52.600,00:01:58.250
Which is differentials.,00:01:58.250,00:02:05.280
"The first and simplest kind
of differential equation",00:02:05.280,00:02:08.480
"is the rate of change
of x with respect to y",00:02:08.480,00:02:12.770
is equal to some function f(x).,00:02:12.770,00:02:16.770
"Now, that's a perfectly
good differential equation.",00:02:16.770,00:02:19.020
"And we already
discussed last time",00:02:19.020,00:02:21.420
"that the solution, that
is, the function y,",00:02:21.420,00:02:26.204
"is going to be the
antiderivative,",00:02:26.204,00:02:27.620
"or the integral, of x.",00:02:27.620,00:02:33.100
"Now, for the purposes
of today, we're",00:02:33.100,00:02:35.880
"going to consider this
problem to be solved.",00:02:35.880,00:02:40.597
"That is, you can always do this.",00:02:40.597,00:02:41.930
"You can always take
antiderivatives.",00:02:41.930,00:02:44.200
"And for our purposes
now, that is for now,",00:02:44.200,00:02:51.560
"we only have one technique
to find antiderivatives.",00:02:51.560,00:03:08.380
And that's called substitution.,00:03:08.380,00:03:15.170
"It has a very small
variant, which",00:03:15.170,00:03:18.750
we called advanced guessing.,00:03:18.750,00:03:27.940
And that works just as well.,00:03:27.940,00:03:29.820
"And that's basically all
that you'll ever need to do.",00:03:29.820,00:03:32.490
"As a practical matter, these are
the ones you'll face for now.",00:03:32.490,00:03:36.457
"Ones that you can actually
see what the answer is,",00:03:36.457,00:03:38.540
"or you'll have to
make a substitution.",00:03:38.540,00:03:42.640
"Now, the first tricky example,
or the first maybe interesting",00:03:42.640,00:03:48.120
"example of a
differential equation,",00:03:48.120,00:03:50.190
"which I'll call Example 2,
is going to be the following.",00:03:50.190,00:04:00.750
"d/dx + x acting on
y is equal to 0.",00:04:00.750,00:04:07.510
"So that's our first
differential equation that",00:04:07.510,00:04:10.580
were going to try to solve.,00:04:10.580,00:04:12.780
"Apart from this standard
antiderivative approach.",00:04:12.780,00:04:18.630
This operation here has a name.,00:04:18.630,00:04:24.350
"This actually has a name,
it's called the annihilation",00:04:24.350,00:04:27.490
operator.,00:04:27.490,00:04:33.460
"And it's called that
in quantum mechanics.",00:04:33.460,00:04:43.780
"And there's a corresponding
creation operator",00:04:43.780,00:04:45.950
"where you change the
sign from plus to minus.",00:04:45.950,00:04:50.780
"And this is one of the simplest
differential equations.",00:04:50.780,00:04:53.660
"The reason why it's
studied in quantum",00:04:53.660,00:04:55.550
"mechanics all it that it
has very simple solutions",00:04:55.550,00:04:58.360
that you can just write out.,00:04:58.360,00:05:00.500
"So we're going to
solve this equation.",00:05:00.500,00:05:02.920
"It's the one that
governs the ground state",00:05:02.920,00:05:05.680
of the harmonic oscillator.,00:05:05.680,00:05:08.670
"So it has a lot of fancy
words associated with it,",00:05:08.670,00:05:10.790
"but it's a fairly simple
differential equation",00:05:10.790,00:05:12.706
"and it works perfectly
by the method",00:05:12.706,00:05:14.430
that we're going to propose.,00:05:14.430,00:05:17.270
"So the first step
in this solution",00:05:17.270,00:05:20.820
"is just to rewrite the
equation by putting",00:05:20.820,00:05:26.800
"one of the terms on
the right-hand side.",00:05:26.800,00:05:29.090
So this is dy/dx = -xy.,00:05:29.090,00:05:32.300
"Now, here is where
you see the difference",00:05:35.700,00:05:37.700
"between this type of equation
and the previous type.",00:05:37.700,00:05:41.210
"In the previous
equation, we just",00:05:41.210,00:05:43.130
"had a function of x on
the right-hand side.",00:05:43.130,00:05:45.660
"But here, the rate of change
depends on both x and y.",00:05:45.660,00:05:50.260
"So it's not clear
at all that we can",00:05:50.260,00:05:51.830
solve this kind of equation.,00:05:51.830,00:05:55.110
"But there is a
remarkable trick which",00:05:55.110,00:05:57.370
works very well in this case.,00:05:57.370,00:05:59.420
Which is to use multiplication.,00:05:59.420,00:06:02.710
"To use this idea of differential
that we talked about last time.",00:06:02.710,00:06:06.340
"Namely, we divide by
y and multiply by dx.",00:06:06.340,00:06:14.700
"So now we've separated
the equation.",00:06:14.700,00:06:17.660
"We've separated out
the differentials.",00:06:17.660,00:06:20.750
"And what's going to
be important for us",00:06:20.750,00:06:22.960
"is that the left-hand side is
expressed solely in terms of y",00:06:22.960,00:06:27.410
"and the right-hand side is
expressed solely in terms of x.",00:06:27.410,00:06:30.170
"And we'll go through
this in careful detail.",00:06:30.170,00:06:33.400
"So now, the idea is if you've
set up the equation in terms",00:06:33.400,00:06:36.410
"of differentials as opposed
to ratios of differentials,",00:06:36.410,00:06:39.680
"or rates of change, now I
can use Leibniz's notation",00:06:39.680,00:06:44.680
"and integrate these
differentials.",00:06:44.680,00:06:47.600
Take their antiderivatives.,00:06:47.600,00:06:55.420
"And we know what
each of these is.",00:06:55.420,00:07:02.070
"Namely, the left-hand side is
just-- Ah, well, that's tough.",00:07:02.070,00:07:17.920
OK.,00:07:17.920,00:07:24.250
"I had an au pair who actually
did a lot of Tae Kwan Do.",00:07:24.250,00:07:29.410
"She could definitely defeat
any of you in any encounter,",00:07:29.410,00:07:32.870
I promise.,00:07:32.870,00:07:34.940
OK.,00:07:34.940,00:07:35.440
Anyway.,00:07:35.440,00:07:37.870
"So, let's go back.",00:07:37.870,00:07:38.970
"We want to take the
antiderivative of this.",00:07:38.970,00:07:41.970
"So remember, this
is the function",00:07:41.970,00:07:48.130
whose derivative is 1/y.,00:07:48.130,00:07:50.140
"And now there's a
slight novelty here.",00:07:50.140,00:07:52.320
"Here we're differentiating
the variable as x,",00:07:52.320,00:07:54.860
"and here we're differentiating
the variable as y.",00:07:54.860,00:07:58.220
"So the antiderivative
here is ln y.",00:07:58.220,00:08:02.860
"And the antiderivative on
the other side is -x^2 / 2.",00:08:02.860,00:08:07.970
And they differ by a constant.,00:08:07.970,00:08:10.400
"So we have this
relationship here.",00:08:10.400,00:08:17.620
"Now, that's almost
the end of the story.",00:08:17.620,00:08:19.660
"We have to exponentiate to
express y in terms of x.",00:08:19.660,00:08:23.100
"So, e^(ln y) = e^(-x^2 / 2) + c.",00:08:23.100,00:08:26.970
"And now I can rewrite that as
y is equal to-- I'll write as A",00:08:29.880,00:08:36.010
"e^(-x^2 / 2), where A = e^c.",00:08:36.010,00:08:40.120
"And incidentally, we're just
taking the case y positive",00:08:43.870,00:08:47.940
here.,00:08:47.940,00:08:48.440
"We'll talk about
what happens when",00:08:48.440,00:08:50.920
y is negative in a few minutes.,00:08:50.920,00:08:55.590
"So here's the answer
to the question,",00:08:55.590,00:08:57.270
"almost, except for this fact
that I picked out y positive.",00:08:57.270,00:09:02.040
"Really, the solution is y
is equal to any multiple",00:09:02.040,00:09:09.890
of e^(-x^2 / 2).,00:09:09.890,00:09:11.780
"Any constant a; a
positive, negative, or 0.",00:09:11.780,00:09:19.310
Any constant will do.,00:09:19.310,00:09:22.240
"And we should double-check
that to make sure.",00:09:22.240,00:09:24.640
"If you take d/dx of y right,
that's going to be a d/dx",00:09:24.640,00:09:32.930
e^(-x^2 / 2).,00:09:32.930,00:09:33.950
"And now by the
chain rule, you can",00:09:36.570,00:09:38.220
"see that this is a times
the factor of -x, that's",00:09:38.220,00:09:42.080
"the derivative of the
exponent, with respect to x,",00:09:42.080,00:09:45.080
times the exponential.,00:09:45.080,00:09:48.190
And now you just rearrange that.,00:09:48.190,00:09:50.770
That's -xy.,00:09:50.770,00:09:54.430
So it does check.,00:09:54.430,00:09:55.860
"These are solutions
to the equation.",00:09:55.860,00:09:57.360
The a didn't matter.,00:09:57.360,00:09:58.560
"It didn't matter whether it
was positive or negative.",00:09:58.560,00:10:05.370
"This function is known as
the normal distribution,",00:10:05.370,00:10:08.750
"so it fits beautifully
with a lot of probability",00:10:08.750,00:10:11.310
"and probabilistic interpretation
of quantum mechanics.",00:10:11.310,00:10:15.710
"This is sort of where
the particle is.",00:10:15.710,00:10:22.630
"So next, what I'd
like to do is just",00:10:22.630,00:10:25.380
"go through the method in general
and point out when it works.",00:10:25.380,00:10:30.920
"And then I'll make
a few comments just",00:10:30.920,00:10:32.960
"to make sure that you understand
the technicalities of dealing",00:10:32.960,00:10:37.650
with constants and so forth.,00:10:37.650,00:10:39.590
"So, first of all, the
general method of separation",00:10:39.590,00:10:42.385
of variables.,00:10:42.385,00:10:53.830
And here's when it works.,00:10:53.830,00:10:55.360
"It works when you're
faced with a differential",00:10:55.360,00:10:58.470
equation of the form f(x) g(y).,00:10:58.470,00:11:03.410
"That's the situation
that we had.",00:11:03.410,00:11:05.920
And I'll just illustrate that.,00:11:05.920,00:11:08.150
Just to remind you here.,00:11:08.150,00:11:09.820
Here's our equation.,00:11:09.820,00:11:11.650
It's in that form.,00:11:11.650,00:11:13.120
"And the function f(x) is -x,
and the function g(y) is just y.",00:11:13.120,00:11:22.190
"And now, the way the method
works is, this separation step.",00:11:22.190,00:11:26.670
"From here to here,
this is the key step.",00:11:26.670,00:11:30.370
"This is the only
conceptually remarkable step,",00:11:30.370,00:11:35.070
"which all has to
do with the fact",00:11:35.070,00:11:37.360
"that Leibniz fixed his
notations up so that this",00:11:37.360,00:11:40.160
works perfectly.,00:11:40.160,00:11:42.190
"And so that involves taking
the y, so dividing by g(y),",00:11:42.190,00:11:48.320
"and multiplying by
dx, it's comfortable",00:11:48.320,00:11:53.170
"because it feels like
ordinary arithmetic,",00:11:53.170,00:11:55.540
"even though these
are differentials.",00:11:55.540,00:11:59.430
"And then, we just
antidifferentiate.",00:11:59.430,00:12:02.710
"So we have a function, H, which
is the integral of dy / g(y),",00:12:02.710,00:12:10.560
"and we have another
function which",00:12:10.560,00:12:12.440
"is F. Note they are functions of
completely different variables",00:12:12.440,00:12:15.910
here.,00:12:15.910,00:12:16.740
Integral of f(x) dx.,00:12:16.740,00:12:20.850
"Now, in our example we did that.",00:12:20.850,00:12:23.864
"We carried out this
antidifferentiation,",00:12:23.864,00:12:25.530
"and this function
turned out to be ln y,",00:12:25.530,00:12:29.680
"and this function turned
out to be -x^2 / 2.",00:12:29.680,00:12:39.630
"And then we write
the relationship.",00:12:39.630,00:12:42.350
"Which is that if these
are both antiderivatives",00:12:42.350,00:12:45.790
"of the same thing, then they
have to differ by a constant.",00:12:45.790,00:12:48.890
"Or, in other words, H(y)
has to equal to F(x) + c.",00:12:48.890,00:12:55.870
Where c is constant.,00:12:55.870,00:13:10.130
"Now, notice that
this kind of equation",00:13:10.130,00:13:15.150
"is what we call an
implicit equation.",00:13:15.150,00:13:20.450
"It's not quite a
formula for y, directly.",00:13:20.450,00:13:23.930
It defines y implicitly.,00:13:23.930,00:13:26.330
That's that top line up here.,00:13:26.330,00:13:29.630
That's the implicit equation.,00:13:29.630,00:13:33.020
"In order to make it an
explicit equation, which",00:13:33.020,00:13:35.110
"is what is underneath, what I
have to do is take the inverse.",00:13:35.110,00:13:38.780
"So I write it as y
= H^(-1)(F(x) + c).",00:13:38.780,00:13:41.260
"Now, in real life the calculus
part is often pretty easy.",00:13:45.080,00:13:48.140
"And it can be quite messy
to do the inverse operation.",00:13:48.140,00:13:52.620
"So sometimes we just leave it
alone in the implicit form.",00:13:52.620,00:13:55.850
"But it's also
satisfying, sometimes,",00:13:55.850,00:13:58.250
"to write it in the
final form here.",00:13:58.250,00:14:09.290
"Now I've got to give you a few
little pieces of commentary",00:14:09.290,00:14:14.160
"before-- For those of you
walked in a little bit late,",00:14:14.160,00:14:16.640
this will all be on the Web.,00:14:16.640,00:14:25.660
"So just a few pieces
of commentary.",00:14:25.660,00:14:31.180
"So if you like, some remarks.",00:14:31.180,00:14:36.230
"The first remark is that I
could have written natural log",00:14:36.230,00:14:51.140
"of absolute y is
equal to -x^2 / 2 + c.",00:14:51.140,00:14:55.850
"We learned last time that
the antiderivative works also",00:14:58.390,00:15:01.871
for the negative values.,00:15:01.871,00:15:02.870
"So this would work
for y not equal to 0.",00:15:02.870,00:15:08.490
"Both for positive
and negative values.",00:15:08.490,00:15:10.900
"And you can see that that
would have captured most",00:15:10.900,00:15:13.990
of the rest of the solution.,00:15:13.990,00:15:15.580
"Namely, |y| would be
equal to A e^(-x^2 / 2),",00:15:15.580,00:15:21.870
by the same reasoning as before.,00:15:21.870,00:15:24.800
"And then that would mean that
y was plus or minus A e^(-x^2 /",00:15:24.800,00:15:29.052
"2), which is really
just what we got.",00:15:29.052,00:15:34.800
"Because, in fact, I
didn't bother with this.",00:15:34.800,00:15:38.120
"Because actually in
most-- and the reason why",00:15:38.120,00:15:40.087
"I'm going through this, by
the way, carefully this time,",00:15:40.087,00:15:42.420
"is that you're going to be
faced with this very frequently.",00:15:42.420,00:15:44.878
"The exponential function
comes up all the time.",00:15:44.878,00:15:47.290
"And so, therefore, you want
to be completely comfortable",00:15:47.290,00:15:49.710
dealing with it.,00:15:49.710,00:15:52.300
"So this time I had
the positive A,",00:15:52.300,00:15:54.510
"while the negative A
fits in either this way,",00:15:54.510,00:15:56.540
or I can throw it in.,00:15:56.540,00:15:57.740
"Because I know that that's
going to work that way.",00:15:57.740,00:15:59.970
"But of course, I
double-checked to be confident.",00:15:59.970,00:16:03.370
"Now, this still
leaves out one value.",00:16:03.370,00:16:07.380
"So, this still leaves
out-- So, if you like,",00:16:07.380,00:16:12.295
"what I have here now is a
is equal to plus or minus",00:16:12.295,00:16:14.420
"capital A. The capital A
one being the positive one.",00:16:14.420,00:16:18.540
"But this still
leaves out one case.",00:16:18.540,00:16:20.920
Which is y = 0.,00:16:20.920,00:16:23.480
"Which is an extremely boring
solution, but nevertheless",00:16:23.480,00:16:27.180
a solution to this problem.,00:16:27.180,00:16:28.760
"If you plug in 0 here
for y, you get 0.",00:16:28.760,00:16:32.330
"If you plug in 0
here for y, you get",00:16:32.330,00:16:34.600
that these two sides are equal.,00:16:34.600,00:16:36.520
0 = 0.,00:16:36.520,00:16:38.080
"Not a very interesting
answer to the question.",00:16:38.080,00:16:40.630
But it's still an answer.,00:16:40.630,00:16:42.290
And so y = 0 is left out..,00:16:42.290,00:16:43.930
"Well, that's not so surprising
that we missed that solution.",00:16:43.930,00:16:52.520
"Because in the process of
carrying out these operations,",00:16:52.520,00:16:56.360
I divided by y.,00:16:56.360,00:16:58.250
I did that right here.,00:16:58.250,00:17:02.290
"So, that's what happens.",00:17:02.290,00:17:03.600
"If you're going to do various
non-linear operations,",00:17:03.600,00:17:05.941
"in particular, if you're
going to divide by something,",00:17:05.941,00:17:08.190
"if it happens to be 0 you're
going to miss that solution.",00:17:08.190,00:17:10.564
"You might have problems
with that solution.",00:17:10.564,00:17:13.860
"But we have to live with that
because we want to get ahead.",00:17:13.860,00:17:16.870
"And we want to get the
formulas for various solutions.",00:17:16.870,00:17:20.520
"So that's the first remark
that I wanted to make.",00:17:20.520,00:17:22.840
"And now, the second
one is almost related",00:17:22.840,00:17:30.340
"to what I was just
discussing right here.",00:17:30.340,00:17:33.380
That I'm erasing.,00:17:33.380,00:17:37.240
And that's the following.,00:17:37.240,00:17:39.420
"I could have also written
ln y + c_1 = -x^2 / 2 + c_2.",00:17:39.420,00:17:52.100
"Where c_1 and c_2 are
different constants.",00:17:52.100,00:17:54.300
"When I'm faced with this
antidifferentiation,",00:17:54.300,00:17:57.210
"I just taught you last
time, that you want",00:17:57.210,00:17:59.460
to have an arbitrary constant.,00:17:59.460,00:18:02.230
"Here and there, in both slots.",00:18:02.230,00:18:06.760
"So I perfectly well could
have written this down.",00:18:06.760,00:18:09.480
"But notice that I can rewrite
this as ln y = -x^2 / 2 + c_2 -",00:18:09.480,00:18:17.990
c_1.,00:18:17.990,00:18:20.190
I can subtract.,00:18:20.190,00:18:22.250
"And then, if I just combine
these two guys together",00:18:22.250,00:18:25.385
"and name them c, I have
a different constant.",00:18:25.385,00:18:29.060
"In other words, it's
superfluous and redundant",00:18:29.060,00:18:32.010
"to have two arbitrary
constants here,",00:18:32.010,00:18:35.060
"because they can always
be combined into one.",00:18:35.060,00:18:38.260
"So two constants
are superfluous.",00:18:38.260,00:18:47.010
Can always be combined.,00:18:47.010,00:18:54.430
"So we just never do
it this first way.",00:18:54.430,00:18:56.490
"It's just extra writing,
it's a waste of time.",00:18:56.490,00:19:05.260
"There's one other subtle
remark, which you won't actually",00:19:05.260,00:19:08.120
"appreciate until you've
done several problems",00:19:08.120,00:19:10.020
in this direction.,00:19:10.020,00:19:11.280
"Which is that the
constant appears",00:19:11.280,00:19:14.490
"additive here, in this first
solution to the problem.",00:19:14.490,00:19:18.900
"But when I do this nonlinear
operation of exponentiation,",00:19:18.900,00:19:22.590
"it now becomes
multiplicative constant.",00:19:22.590,00:19:26.390
"And so, in general, there's
a free constant somewhere",00:19:26.390,00:19:31.006
in the problem.,00:19:31.006,00:19:31.630
"But it's not always
an additive constant.",00:19:31.630,00:19:35.490
"It's only an additive constant
right at the first step",00:19:35.490,00:19:38.330
"when you take the
antiderivative.",00:19:38.330,00:19:39.890
"And then after that, when you
do all your other nonlinear",00:19:39.890,00:19:42.265
"operations, it can turn
into anything at all.",00:19:42.265,00:19:45.440
"So you should always expect it
to be something slightly more",00:19:45.440,00:19:47.980
"interesting than an
additive constant.",00:19:47.980,00:19:49.563
"Although occasionally it
stays an additive constant.",00:19:49.563,00:19:59.060
"The last little
bit of commentary",00:19:59.060,00:20:01.180
"that I want to make just goes
back to the original problem",00:20:01.180,00:20:06.010
here.,00:20:06.010,00:20:06.810
Which is right here.,00:20:06.810,00:20:09.680
The example 1.,00:20:09.680,00:20:11.190
"And I want to solve it, even
though this is simpleminded.",00:20:11.190,00:20:14.490
But Example 1 via separation.,00:20:14.490,00:20:21.490
So that you see our variables.,00:20:21.490,00:20:25.290
So that you see what it does.,00:20:25.290,00:20:28.440
The situation is this.,00:20:28.440,00:20:34.230
"And the separation
just means you",00:20:34.230,00:20:35.890
put the dx on the other side.,00:20:35.890,00:20:38.570
So this is dy = f(x) dx.,00:20:38.570,00:20:44.030
And then we integrate.,00:20:44.030,00:20:54.680
"And the antiderivative
of dy is just y.",00:20:54.680,00:20:58.170
"So this is the solution
to the problem.",00:20:58.170,00:21:03.490
"And it's just what
we wrote before;",00:21:03.490,00:21:05.170
it's just a funny notation.,00:21:05.170,00:21:07.480
"And it comes to the same
thing as the antiderivative.",00:21:07.480,00:21:19.480
"OK, so now we're going to
go on to a trickier problem.",00:21:19.480,00:21:23.240
A trickier example.,00:21:23.240,00:21:24.090
"We need one or two more
just to get some practice",00:21:24.090,00:21:26.420
with this method.,00:21:26.420,00:21:29.330
Everybody happy so far?,00:21:29.330,00:21:31.730
Question.,00:21:31.730,00:21:32.240
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:21:32.240,00:21:53.472
"PROFESSOR: So, the
question is, how do we",00:21:53.472,00:21:55.180
deal with this ambiguity.,00:21:55.180,00:21:58.150
"I'm summarizing very,
very, briefly what I heard.",00:21:58.150,00:22:03.020
"Well, you know, sometimes
a &gt; 0, sometimes a &lt; 0,",00:22:03.020,00:22:06.530
sometimes it's not.,00:22:06.530,00:22:07.550
So there's a name for this guy.,00:22:07.550,00:22:12.810
"Which is that this is what's
called the general solution.",00:22:12.810,00:22:20.136
"In other words, the
whole family of solutions",00:22:20.136,00:22:22.010
is the answer to the question.,00:22:22.010,00:22:24.460
"Now, it could be that you're
given extra information.",00:22:24.460,00:22:28.020
"If you're given extra
information, that might be,",00:22:28.020,00:22:31.760
"and this is very typical
in such problems,",00:22:31.760,00:22:33.527
"you have the rate of change
of the function, which",00:22:33.527,00:22:35.610
is what we've given.,00:22:35.610,00:22:36.510
"But you might also have
the place where it starts.",00:22:36.510,00:22:39.780
"Which would be,
say, it starts at 3.",00:22:39.780,00:22:44.579
"Now, if you have that
extra piece of information,",00:22:44.579,00:22:46.620
"then you can nail down
exactly which function it is.",00:22:46.620,00:22:50.670
"If you do that,
if you plug in 3,",00:22:50.670,00:22:52.420
"you see that a times
e^(-0^2 / 2) is equal to 3.",00:22:52.420,00:22:57.860
So a = 3.,00:22:57.860,00:23:00.300
"And the answer is
y = 3e^(-x^2 / 2).",00:23:00.300,00:23:02.720
"And similarly, if it's negative,
if it starts out negative,",00:23:06.140,00:23:08.940
it'll stay negative.,00:23:08.940,00:23:10.100
For instance.,00:23:10.100,00:23:11.100
"If it starts out 0, it'll stay
0, this particular function",00:23:11.100,00:23:14.870
here.,00:23:14.870,00:23:16.100
"So the answer to
your question is how",00:23:16.100,00:23:18.110
you deal with the ambiguity.,00:23:18.110,00:23:19.700
"The answer is that you simply
say what the solution is.",00:23:19.700,00:23:23.620
"And the solution is
not one function,",00:23:23.620,00:23:25.200
it's a family of functions.,00:23:25.200,00:23:26.324
"It's a list and you have to have
what's known as a parameter.",00:23:26.324,00:23:30.340
"And that parameter
gets nailed down",00:23:30.340,00:23:32.440
"if you tell me more
information about the function.",00:23:32.440,00:23:35.240
"Not the rate of change, but
something about the values",00:23:35.240,00:23:37.654

showing you here",00:23:56.553,00:23:58.176
"that you could get to most
of the general solution.",00:23:58.176,00:24:00.300
"There's one thing that's left
out, namely the case a = 0.",00:24:00.300,00:24:04.570
"So, in other words, I would
not go through this method.",00:24:04.570,00:24:08.120
"I would only use this,
which is simpler.",00:24:08.120,00:24:10.690

that I haven't gotten",00:24:10.690,00:24:13.590
all of the solutions this way.,00:24:13.590,00:24:15.410
"I'm going to need to throw in
all the rest of the solutions.",00:24:15.410,00:24:19.325

your head, you always",00:24:19.325,00:24:20.950
"have to have something
like this in mind.",00:24:20.950,00:24:23.779
"So that you can generate
all the solutions.",00:24:23.779,00:24:25.570
"This is very suggestive, right?",00:24:25.570,00:24:28.510
"The restriction, it turns
that the restriction A &gt; 0 is",00:24:28.510,00:24:31.840

a formula x is a function of y",00:25:48.835,00:25:51.540
versus y is a function of x.,00:25:51.540,00:25:54.730
"The way in which the
function is specified",00:25:54.730,00:25:57.850
"is something that
can be complicated.",00:25:57.850,00:26:00.780
"As you'll see in
the next example,",00:26:00.780,00:26:02.810
"it's not necessarily
the best thing",00:26:02.810,00:26:04.760
"to think about a function--
y as a function of x.",00:26:04.760,00:26:07.530
"Well, in the fourth example.",00:26:07.530,00:26:12.170
"Alright, we're going to go on
and do our next example here.",00:26:12.170,00:26:27.000
"So the third example
is going to be taken",00:26:27.000,00:26:32.440
as a kind of geometry problem.,00:26:32.440,00:26:36.090
I'll draw a picture of it.,00:26:36.090,00:26:38.990
"Suppose you have a curve
with the following property.",00:26:38.990,00:26:44.180
"If you take a point on the
curve, and you take the ray,",00:26:44.180,00:26:50.730
"you take the ray from the origin
to the curve, well, that's not",00:26:50.730,00:26:56.224
going to be one that I want.,00:26:56.224,00:26:57.390
"I think I'm going to want
something which is steeper.",00:26:57.390,00:27:00.350
"Because what I'm
going to insist is",00:27:00.350,00:27:02.130
"that the tangent line be
twice as steep as the ray",00:27:02.130,00:27:09.050
from the origin.,00:27:09.050,00:27:10.490
"So, in other words,
slope of tangent line",00:27:10.490,00:27:19.600
"equals twice slope
of ray from origin.",00:27:19.600,00:27:31.540
"So the slope of this
orange line is twice",00:27:31.540,00:27:34.110
the slope of the pink line.,00:27:34.110,00:27:39.410
"Now, these kinds of
geometric problems",00:27:39.410,00:27:41.240
"can be written very succinctly
with differential equations.",00:27:41.240,00:27:48.700
"Namely, it's just the
following. dy / dx,",00:27:48.700,00:27:51.530
"that's the slope of the
tangent line, is equal to,",00:27:51.530,00:27:55.340
"well remember what the
slope of this ray is,",00:27:55.340,00:27:58.030
"if this point-- I
need a notation.",00:27:58.030,00:28:00.700
"At this point is (x, y) which
is a point on the curve.",00:28:00.700,00:28:04.520
"So the slope of this
pink line is what?",00:28:04.520,00:28:07.860
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:28:07.860,00:28:09.650
PROFESSOR: y/x.,00:28:09.650,00:28:12.610
"So if it's twice it,
there's the equation.",00:28:12.610,00:28:20.810
"OK, now, we only have one method
for solving these equations.",00:28:20.810,00:28:28.040
So let's use it.,00:28:28.040,00:28:29.890
It says to separate variables.,00:28:29.890,00:28:31.620
"So I write dy / y here,
is equal to 2 dx / x.",00:28:31.620,00:28:41.000
That's the basic separation.,00:28:41.000,00:28:42.530
"That's the procedure that
we're always going to use.",00:28:42.530,00:28:47.990
"And now if I
integrate that, I find",00:28:47.990,00:28:54.640
"that on the right-hand side
I have the logarithm of y.",00:28:54.640,00:29:03.250
"And on the left-hand--
Sorry, on the left-hand side",00:29:03.250,00:29:05.380
I have the logarithm of y.,00:29:05.380,00:29:06.590
"On the right-hand side, I
have twice the logarithm",00:29:06.590,00:29:10.500
"of x, plus a constant.",00:29:10.500,00:29:20.150
"So let's see what
happens to this example.",00:29:20.150,00:29:27.330
"This is an implicit
equation, and of course we",00:29:27.330,00:29:29.846
"have the problems of the
plus or minus signs, which",00:29:29.846,00:29:31.970
"I'm not going to worry
about until later.",00:29:31.970,00:29:38.070
"So let's exponentiate
and see what happens.",00:29:38.070,00:29:40.320
"We get e^(ln y)
= e^(2 ln x + c).",00:29:40.320,00:29:43.600
"So, again, this is y
on the left-hand side.",00:29:47.340,00:29:51.940
"And on the right-hand
side, if you think about it",00:29:51.940,00:29:54.010
"for a second, it's (e^(ln x))^2.",00:29:54.010,00:29:55.770
Which is x^2.,00:29:59.050,00:30:00.370
"So this is x^2, and
then there's an e^c.",00:30:00.370,00:30:02.680
"So that's another one
of these A factors here.",00:30:02.680,00:30:06.390
A = e^c.,00:30:06.390,00:30:13.240
"So the answer is, well,
I'll draw the picture.",00:30:13.240,00:30:20.160
"And I'm going to
cheat as I did before.",00:30:20.160,00:30:22.530
We skipped the case y negative.,00:30:22.530,00:30:24.550
"We really only did the
case y positive, so far.",00:30:24.550,00:30:30.236
"But if you think
about it for a second,",00:30:30.236,00:30:31.860
"and we'll check it
in a second, you're",00:30:31.860,00:30:33.490
"going to get all of
these parabolas here.",00:30:33.490,00:30:36.390
"So the solution is this
family of functions.",00:30:36.390,00:30:40.970
And they can be bending down.,00:30:40.970,00:30:44.330
As well as up.,00:30:44.330,00:30:45.660
"So these are the solutions
to this equation.",00:30:45.660,00:30:48.140
"Every single one of these
curves has the property",00:30:48.140,00:30:50.410
"that if you pick a point
on it, the tangent line",00:30:50.410,00:30:52.750
"has twice the slope of
the ray to the origin.",00:30:52.750,00:30:58.050
"And the formula, if you like,
of the general solution is y =",00:30:58.050,00:31:01.840
"ax^2, a is any constant.",00:31:01.840,00:31:08.960
Question?,00:31:08.960,00:31:09.460
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:31:09.460,00:31:21.844
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:31:21.844,00:31:22.510
"So again - so first
of all, so there",00:31:22.510,00:31:28.960
are two approaches to this.,00:31:28.960,00:31:30.110
"One is to check it, and
make sure that it's right.",00:31:30.110,00:31:32.900
"When a formula works for
some family of values,",00:31:32.900,00:31:35.140
sometimes it works for others.,00:31:35.140,00:31:36.740
"But another one is to realize
that these things will usually",00:31:36.740,00:31:39.650
work out this way.,00:31:39.650,00:31:40.970
"Because in this argument here,
I allow the absolute value.",00:31:40.970,00:31:45.459
"And that would have been a
perfectly legal thing for me",00:31:45.459,00:31:47.750
to do.,00:31:47.750,00:31:48.250
"I could have put in
absolute values here.",00:31:48.250,00:31:51.220
"In which case, I would've gotten
that the absolute value of this",00:31:51.220,00:31:55.690
was equal to that.,00:31:55.690,00:31:56.890
"And now you see I've covered
the plus and minus cases.",00:31:56.890,00:32:02.370
So it's that same idea.,00:32:02.370,00:32:03.880
"This implies that y is equal
to either Ax^2 or -Ax^2,",00:32:03.880,00:32:11.180
"depending on which
sign you pick.",00:32:11.180,00:32:14.100
"So that allows me for the
curves above and curves below.",00:32:14.100,00:32:21.210
"Because it's really true that
the antiderivative here is this",00:32:21.210,00:32:25.470
function.,00:32:25.470,00:32:26.240
It's defined for y negative.,00:32:26.240,00:32:28.820
So let's just double-check.,00:32:28.820,00:32:33.840
"In this case, what's happening,
we have y = ax^2 and we want",00:32:33.840,00:32:39.460
"to compute dy/dx to make sure
that it satisfies the equation",00:32:39.460,00:32:44.410
that I started out with.,00:32:44.410,00:32:46.040
"And what I see here
is that this is 2ax.",00:32:46.040,00:32:50.890
"And now I'm going to write
this in a suggestive way.",00:32:50.890,00:32:53.370
"I'm going to write
it as 2ax^2 / x.",00:32:53.370,00:33:00.330
"And, sure enough,
this is 2y / x.",00:33:00.330,00:33:06.610
"It does not matter
whether a-- it",00:33:06.610,00:33:08.810
"works for a positive,
a negative, a equals 0.",00:33:08.810,00:33:17.370
It's OK.,00:33:17.370,00:33:24.180
"Again, we didn't pick up by
this method the a = 0 case.",00:33:24.180,00:33:29.770
"And that's not surprising
because we divided by y.",00:33:29.770,00:33:35.350
"There's another thing to watch
out about, about this example.",00:33:35.350,00:33:39.660
So there's another warning.,00:33:39.660,00:33:41.990
Which I have to give you.,00:33:41.990,00:33:44.910
"And this is a subtlety
which you definitely",00:33:44.910,00:33:47.130
"won't get to in any
detail until you",00:33:47.130,00:33:50.090
"get to a higher level ordinary
differential equations course,",00:33:50.090,00:33:54.070
"but I do want to warn
you about it right now.",00:33:54.070,00:33:56.980
"Which is that if you
look at the equation,",00:33:56.980,00:34:05.310
"you need to watch out that
it's undefined at x = 0.",00:34:05.310,00:34:14.100
It's undefined at x = 0.,00:34:14.100,00:34:15.700
"We also divided by x,
and x is also a problem.",00:34:15.700,00:34:20.350
"Now, that actually has
an important consequence.",00:34:20.350,00:34:24.690
"Which is that, strangely,
knowing the value here",00:34:24.690,00:34:27.820
"and knowing the rate of change
doesn't specify this function.",00:34:27.820,00:34:31.040
This is bad.,00:34:31.040,00:34:33.180
"And it violates one of
our pieces of intuition.",00:34:33.180,00:34:36.160
"And what's going wrong is
that the rate of change",00:34:36.160,00:34:38.720
was not specified.,00:34:38.720,00:34:40.600
It's undefined at x = 0.,00:34:40.600,00:34:43.560
"So there's a problem
here, and in fact",00:34:43.560,00:34:45.260
"if you think carefully about
what this function is doing,",00:34:45.260,00:34:48.220
"it could come in on one branch
and leave on a completely",00:34:48.220,00:34:53.510
different branch.,00:34:53.510,00:34:56.050
"It doesn't really have to
obey any rule across x = 0.",00:34:56.050,00:35:01.541
"So you should really be
thinking of these things",00:35:01.541,00:35:03.540
"as rays emanating
from the origin.",00:35:03.540,00:35:05.860
"The origin was a special point
in the whole geometric problem.",00:35:05.860,00:35:10.140
"Rather than as being
complete parabolas.",00:35:10.140,00:35:15.080
But that's a very subtle point.,00:35:15.080,00:35:16.460
"I don't expect you to be able
to say anything about it.",00:35:16.460,00:35:23.270
"But I just want to warn
you that it really is true",00:35:23.270,00:35:25.920
"that when x = 0 there's a
problem for this differential",00:35:25.920,00:35:30.640
equation.,00:35:30.640,00:35:33.810
"So now, let me say
our next problem.",00:35:33.810,00:35:46.570
Next example.,00:35:46.570,00:35:47.690
Just another geometry question.,00:35:47.690,00:35:52.370
So here's Example 4.,00:35:52.370,00:36:01.430
"I'm just going to use the
example that we've already got.",00:36:01.430,00:36:04.430
"Because there's only
so much time left here.",00:36:04.430,00:36:09.090
"The fourth example is to
take the curves perpendicular",00:36:09.090,00:36:23.480
to the parabolas.,00:36:23.480,00:36:31.610
"This is another
geometry problem.",00:36:31.610,00:36:33.332
"And by specifying that
the the curves are",00:36:33.332,00:36:35.040
"perpendicular to
these parabolas,",00:36:35.040,00:36:37.020
"I'm telling you
what their slope is.",00:36:37.020,00:36:44.500
So let's think about that.,00:36:44.500,00:36:47.000
What's the new equation?,00:36:47.000,00:36:48.900
"The new diff. eq.
is the following.",00:36:48.900,00:36:56.270
"It's that the slope is equal
to the negative reciprocal",00:36:56.270,00:37:01.550
"of the slope of
the tangent line.",00:37:01.550,00:37:05.610
Of tangent to the parabola.,00:37:05.610,00:37:14.850
So that's the equation.,00:37:14.850,00:37:16.800
"That's actually fairly
easy to write down,",00:37:16.800,00:37:19.270
"because it's -1
divided by 2 y/x.",00:37:19.270,00:37:26.570
"That's the slope
of the parabola.",00:37:26.570,00:37:32.281
2y/x.,00:37:32.281,00:37:32.780
So let's rewrite that.,00:37:36.860,00:37:38.300
"Now, this is-- the x goes in
the numerator, so it's -x/(2y).",00:37:38.300,00:37:52.160
"And now I want to
solve this one.",00:37:52.160,00:37:57.990
"Well, again, there's
only one technique.",00:37:57.990,00:38:01.780
"Which is we're going
to separate variables.",00:38:01.780,00:38:10.240
"And we separate the
differentials here,",00:38:10.240,00:38:12.010
so we get 2y dy = -x dx.,00:38:12.010,00:38:18.201
"That's just looking at
the equation that I have,",00:38:18.201,00:38:20.200
which is right over here.,00:38:20.200,00:38:22.640
"dy/dx = -x/(2y), and
cross-multiplying to get this.",00:38:22.640,00:38:30.760
"And now I can take
the antiderivative.",00:38:30.760,00:38:33.100
This is y^2.,00:38:33.100,00:38:35.850
"And the antiderivative
over here is -x^2 / 2 + c.",00:38:35.850,00:38:40.670
"And so, the solutions are x^2
/ 2 + y^2 is equal to some c,",00:38:44.410,00:38:57.410
some constant c.,00:38:57.410,00:39:02.600
"Now, this time, things
don't work the same.",00:39:02.600,00:39:06.460
"And you can't expect them
always to work the same.",00:39:06.460,00:39:09.600
"I claimed that
this must be true.",00:39:09.600,00:39:11.550
"But unfortunately I cannot
insist that every c will work.",00:39:11.550,00:39:16.910
"As you can see here, only
the positive numbers c",00:39:16.910,00:39:21.040
can work here.,00:39:21.040,00:39:24.980
"So the picture is that
something slightly different",00:39:24.980,00:39:28.720
happened here.,00:39:28.720,00:39:29.530
And you have to live with this.,00:39:29.530,00:39:31.310
"Is that sometimes not all
the constants will work.",00:39:31.310,00:39:33.570
"Because there's more to
the problem than just",00:39:33.570,00:39:36.270
the antidifferentiation.,00:39:36.270,00:39:37.880
"And here there are fewer answers
rather than more answers.",00:39:37.880,00:39:40.870
"In the other case we had
to add in some answers,",00:39:40.870,00:39:43.110
here we have to take them away.,00:39:43.110,00:39:45.030
"Some of them don't
make any sense.",00:39:45.030,00:39:46.890
"And the only ones we
can get are the ones",00:39:46.890,00:39:48.644
"which are of this
form, where this",00:39:48.644,00:39:50.060
"is, say, some radius squared.",00:39:50.060,00:39:53.804
"Well maybe I shouldn't
call it a radius.",00:39:53.804,00:39:55.470
"I'll just call it
a parameter, a^2.",00:39:55.470,00:39:58.800
"And these are of
course ellipses.",00:39:58.800,00:40:05.940
"And you can see
that the ellipses,",00:40:05.940,00:40:09.080
"the length here is
the square root of 2a",00:40:09.080,00:40:13.990
"and the semi-axis,
vertical semi-axis, is a.",00:40:13.990,00:40:18.160
"So this is the kind of
ellipse that we've got.",00:40:18.160,00:40:20.110
"And I draw it on the
previous diagram,",00:40:20.110,00:40:24.140
"I think it's somewhat
suggestive here.",00:40:24.140,00:40:28.100
"There, ellipses
are kind of eggs.",00:40:28.100,00:40:30.280
"They're a little bit
longer than they are high.",00:40:30.280,00:40:32.820
And they go like this.,00:40:32.820,00:40:37.160
"And if I drew them
pretty much right,",00:40:37.160,00:40:40.960
"they should be
making right angles.",00:40:40.960,00:40:43.230
At all of these places.,00:40:43.230,00:40:49.710
"OK, last little bit here.",00:40:49.710,00:40:53.530
"Again, you've got to be very
careful with these solutions.",00:40:53.530,00:40:57.930
"And so there's a
warning here too.",00:40:57.930,00:41:06.760
"So let's take a
look at the-- This",00:41:06.760,00:41:08.500
"is the implicit solution
to the equation.",00:41:08.500,00:41:10.924
"And this is the one that
tells us what the shape is.",00:41:10.924,00:41:13.090
"But we can also have
the explicit solution.",00:41:13.090,00:41:16.350
"And if I solve for
the explicit solution,",00:41:16.350,00:41:18.170
"it's y is equal to either plus
square root of (a^2 - x^2 / 2),",00:41:18.170,00:41:25.400
"or y is equal to minus the
square root of (a^2 - x^2 / 2).",00:41:25.400,00:41:32.080
"These are the
explicit solutions.",00:41:32.080,00:41:39.770
"And now, we notice
something that we",00:41:39.770,00:41:41.350
should have noticed before.,00:41:41.350,00:41:43.850
"Which is that an ellipse
is not a function.",00:41:43.850,00:41:50.490
"It's only the top
half, if you like,",00:41:50.490,00:41:54.070
"that's giving you a
solution to this equation.",00:41:54.070,00:41:56.610
"Or maybe the bottom
half that's giving it",00:41:56.610,00:41:58.740
the solution to the equation.,00:41:58.740,00:42:00.450
"So the one over here, this
one is the top halves.",00:42:00.450,00:42:07.480
"And this one over here
is the bottom halves.",00:42:07.480,00:42:15.270
"And there's something
else that's interesting.",00:42:15.270,00:42:18.570
"Which is that we have a
problem at y = 0. y = 0",00:42:18.570,00:42:28.560
is where x = square root of 2a.,00:42:28.560,00:42:33.550
"That's when we get
to this end here.",00:42:33.550,00:42:35.960
"And what happens is the solution
comes around and it stops.",00:42:35.960,00:42:38.800
It has a vertical slope.,00:42:38.800,00:42:44.820
Vertical slope.,00:42:44.820,00:42:48.910
And the solution stops.,00:42:48.910,00:42:56.420
"But really, that's
not so unreasonable.",00:42:56.420,00:43:00.020
"After all, look at the formula.",00:43:00.020,00:43:01.890
"There was a y in the
denominator here.",00:43:01.890,00:43:03.660
"When y = 0, the slope
should be infinite.",00:43:03.660,00:43:08.500
"And so this equation
is just giving us",00:43:08.500,00:43:12.530
"what it geometrically
and intuitively",00:43:12.530,00:43:14.490
should be giving us.,00:43:14.490,00:43:15.800
At that stage.,00:43:15.800,00:43:22.790
"So that is the introduction
to ordinary differential",00:43:22.790,00:43:26.221
equations.,00:43:26.221,00:43:26.720
"Again, there's
only one technique",00:43:26.720,00:43:28.740
"which is-- We're not done yet,
we have a whole four minutes",00:43:28.740,00:43:32.580
left and we're going to review.,00:43:32.580,00:43:34.030
"Now, so fortunately, this
review is very short.",00:43:34.030,00:43:39.220
"Fortunately for you,
I handed out to you",00:43:39.220,00:43:42.170
"exactly what you're going
to be covering on the test.",00:43:42.170,00:43:44.920
"And it's what's printed
here but there's a whole two",00:43:44.920,00:43:48.440
pages of discussion.,00:43:48.440,00:43:51.000
"And I want to give you very,
very clear-cut instructions",00:43:51.000,00:43:59.500
here.,00:43:59.500,00:44:00.000
"This is usually the hardest
test of this course.",00:44:00.000,00:44:04.780
"People usually do
terribly on it.",00:44:04.780,00:44:07.170
"And I'm going to
try to stop that",00:44:07.170,00:44:11.840
"by making it a
little bit easier.",00:44:11.840,00:44:14.850
"And now here's what
we're going to do.",00:44:14.850,00:44:17.620
"I'm telling you exactly
what type of problems",00:44:17.620,00:44:21.150
are going to be on the test.,00:44:21.150,00:44:22.447
These are these six.,00:44:22.447,00:44:23.280
"It's also written on
your sheet, your handout.",00:44:23.280,00:44:25.940
"It's also just what was
asked on last year's test.",00:44:25.940,00:44:29.012
"You should go and you should
look at last year's test",00:44:29.012,00:44:31.220
"and see what types
of problems they are.",00:44:31.220,00:44:33.420
"I really, really, am going
to ask the same questions,",00:44:33.420,00:44:36.210
or the same type of questions.,00:44:36.210,00:44:38.900
Not the same questions.,00:44:38.900,00:44:41.860
"So that's what's going
to happen on the test.",00:44:41.860,00:44:44.960
"And let me just tell
you, say one thing, which",00:44:44.960,00:44:48.680
is the main theme of the class.,00:44:48.680,00:44:51.210
And I will open up.,00:44:51.210,00:44:52.290
"We'll have time for one
question after that.",00:44:52.290,00:44:54.330
"The main theme of this unit
is simply the following.",00:44:54.330,00:44:58.540
"That information about
derivative and sometimes",00:44:58.540,00:45:05.460
"maybe the second
derivative, tells us",00:45:05.460,00:45:11.010
information about f itself.,00:45:11.010,00:45:17.315
"And that's just what were doing
here with ordinary differential",00:45:17.315,00:45:19.940
equations.,00:45:19.940,00:45:20.490
"And that was what we were
doing way at the beginning when",00:45:20.490,00:45:22.865
we did approximations.,00:45:22.865,00:45:23.825
