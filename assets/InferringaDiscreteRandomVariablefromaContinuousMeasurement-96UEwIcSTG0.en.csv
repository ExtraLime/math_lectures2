Hi.,00:00:00.430,00:00:00.630
"In this problem, we're going
to look at how to infer a",00:00:00.630,00:00:04.280
"discrete random variable from
a continuous measurement.",00:00:04.280,00:00:08.810
"And really, what it's going to
give us is some practice",00:00:08.810,00:00:11.390
"working with a variation
of Bayes' rule.",00:00:11.390,00:00:14.950
"So the problem tells us that
we have a discrete random",00:00:14.950,00:00:17.860
variable x with this PMF.,00:00:17.860,00:00:20.830
"It is 1 with probability P,
minus 1 with probability 1",00:00:20.830,00:00:25.590
"minus P, and 0 otherwise.",00:00:25.590,00:00:27.540
"So here is just a diagram
of this PMF.",00:00:27.540,00:00:30.940
"And then we also have another
random variable, y, which is",00:00:30.940,00:00:33.370
continuous.,00:00:33.370,00:00:34.650
And its PDF is given by this.,00:00:34.650,00:00:37.030
"It's 1/2 lambda e to the minus
lambda times the absolute",00:00:37.030,00:00:40.700
value of y.,00:00:40.700,00:00:41.780
And so this may look familiar.,00:00:41.780,00:00:43.760
"It looks kind of like
an exponential.",00:00:43.760,00:00:45.500
"And in fact, it's just a
two-sided exponential.",00:00:45.500,00:00:49.200
"That's flattened by
a factor of 1/2.",00:00:49.200,00:00:51.740
"And this is what it looks like,
kind of like a tent that",00:00:51.740,00:00:54.060
goes on both ways.,00:00:54.060,00:00:56.510
"And then we have a random
variable z, which is equal to",00:00:56.510,00:00:59.820
the sum of x and y.,00:00:59.820,00:01:02.590
"And the problem is going to be
figuring out what x is, based",00:01:02.590,00:01:07.190
"on an observed value
of what z is.",00:01:07.190,00:01:10.550
"So because x is discrete
and y is random--",00:01:10.550,00:01:12.940
"sorry, x is discrete, and y is
continuous, z is also going to",00:01:12.940,00:01:16.390
be continuous.,00:01:16.390,00:01:17.520
"So our measurement is z,
which is continuous.",00:01:17.520,00:01:20.100
"And we want to infer x,
which is discrete.",00:01:20.100,00:01:24.440
"So the problem asked us to
find is this what is the",00:01:24.440,00:01:27.850
"probability that x equals 1,
given that z is a little z.",00:01:27.850,00:01:34.090
"And you can write this another
way, just as a",00:01:34.090,00:01:36.130
conditional PMF as well.,00:01:36.130,00:01:37.870
"It's the conditional PMF of
x, given z, evaluated to 1",00:01:37.870,00:01:43.700
conditioned on little z.,00:01:43.700,00:01:46.780
"All right, so now let's apply
the correct variation of",00:01:46.780,00:01:52.230
Bayes' rule.,00:01:52.230,00:01:53.210
"So remember, it's going to be
this, the probability that x",00:01:53.210,00:02:00.620
"equals 1, or the PMF of x
evaluated to 1, times the--",00:02:00.620,00:02:06.910
you flip this conditioning.,00:02:06.910,00:02:08.580
"So now it's going to be a
conditional PDF of z, since z",00:02:08.580,00:02:12.655
is continuous.,00:02:12.655,00:02:14.250
"It's going to be a conditional
PDF of z, given x, evaluated",00:02:14.250,00:02:18.610
"at some little z condition
on x being 1.",00:02:18.610,00:02:22.450
"And the bottom is the
conditional PDF--",00:02:22.450,00:02:28.600
"or sorry, just the
regular PDF of z.",00:02:28.600,00:02:33.510
"And of course, we can rewrite
this denominator.",00:02:33.510,00:02:37.270
"Remember, the denominator is
always just-- you can use the",00:02:37.270,00:02:40.560
"law of total probability
and rewrite it.",00:02:40.560,00:02:42.820
"And one of the terms is
going to be exactly",00:02:42.820,00:02:44.420
the same as the numerator.,00:02:44.420,00:02:46.870
"So one of the ways that z can
be some little z is it's in",00:02:46.870,00:02:51.940
"combination with x
being equal to 1.",00:02:51.940,00:02:54.980
"And the probability of that
is exactly the same",00:02:54.980,00:02:57.680
thing as the numerator.,00:02:57.680,00:03:00.250
"And the other way is if x
is equal to negative 1.",00:03:00.250,00:03:05.930
"And that gives us this
second term.",00:03:05.930,00:03:08.940
 ,00:03:08.940,00:03:12.167
All right.,00:03:12.167,00:03:14.480
"And now let's just fill
in what all these",00:03:14.480,00:03:17.320
different terms are.,00:03:17.320,00:03:18.810
"So with the PMF of x evaluated
at 1, that is just P. What is",00:03:18.810,00:03:25.580
"the conditional PDF of z, given
that x is equal to 1?",00:03:25.580,00:03:30.240
"Well, that takes a little
bit more work.",00:03:30.240,00:03:32.590
"Given that x is 1, then z
is just going to be--",00:03:32.590,00:03:38.980
"so if x equals 1, then z is
just y plus 1, which means",00:03:38.980,00:03:48.260
"that you can just imagine taking
y-- this is what y is,",00:03:48.260,00:03:51.030
the distribution of y--,00:03:51.030,00:03:52.250
"and just adding 1 to it, which,
in this diagram, would",00:03:52.250,00:03:55.970
"amount to shifting
it over by one.",00:03:55.970,00:03:58.070
"So now, it would look like
this, the distribution.",00:03:58.070,00:04:04.320
"And algebraically, all you would
do is just change this",00:04:04.320,00:04:09.610
"thing in the absolute
value to y minus 1.",00:04:09.610,00:04:13.075
"That amounts to shifting it
over to the right by one.",00:04:13.075,00:04:15.976
All right.,00:04:15.976,00:04:16.370
So what is that?,00:04:16.370,00:04:17.170
"That's just 1/2 lambda,
1/2 lambda, e to the",00:04:17.170,00:04:25.780
minus lambda y--,00:04:25.780,00:04:29.470
"sorry, not y, z--",00:04:29.470,00:04:31.536
 ,00:04:31.536,00:04:34.870
z minus 1.,00:04:34.870,00:04:37.110
 ,00:04:37.110,00:04:39.820
"And the denominator, well, the
first term is going to be",00:04:39.820,00:04:43.320
exactly the same.,00:04:43.320,00:04:44.230
"It's just also P 1/2 lambda e to
the minus lambda z minus 1.",00:04:44.230,00:04:51.790
What about the second term?,00:04:51.790,00:04:52.850
"The second term, first we need
to figure out what is the PMF",00:04:52.850,00:04:55.650
"of x evaluated at
a negative 1.",00:04:55.650,00:04:57.280
"Or in other words, what's
the probability that",00:04:57.280,00:04:58.790
x is negative 1?,00:04:58.790,00:05:00.200
"That is given to
us by the PMF.",00:05:00.200,00:05:02.110
It's 1 minus P.,00:05:02.110,00:05:05.950
"And then the second part is,
what is the conditional PDF of",00:05:05.950,00:05:08.800
"z, given that x is negative 1?",00:05:08.800,00:05:11.330
"Well, we can just do the same
sort of trick here.",00:05:11.330,00:05:15.770
"If x is negative 1, then
z is just y minus 1.",00:05:15.770,00:05:19.810
"In which case, the PDF of z
would just look like this.",00:05:19.810,00:05:24.950
"You're shifted to the
left by one now.",00:05:24.950,00:05:26.710
"And now what you have to do is
change this into a plus 1.",00:05:26.710,00:05:31.140
"So this conditional PDF would
be 1/2 lambda e to the minus",00:05:31.140,00:05:35.800
"lambda z plus 1, absolute
value of z plus 1.",00:05:35.800,00:05:42.490
"All right, so this looks
pretty messy.",00:05:42.490,00:05:44.580
"And we can try to simplify
things a little bit.",00:05:44.580,00:05:49.830
"So we can get rid of
these 1/2 lambdas.",00:05:49.830,00:05:53.880
 ,00:05:53.880,00:05:58.500
"And then we can multiply the
numerator and the denominator",00:05:58.500,00:06:04.910
by the same term.,00:06:04.910,00:06:06.390
"Let's multiply it by e to
the lambda absolute",00:06:06.390,00:06:09.200
value of z minus 1.,00:06:09.200,00:06:10.670
"So what we're going to do is
try to cancel out some of",00:06:10.670,00:06:13.120
these exponential terms.,00:06:13.120,00:06:14.960
"So that will cancel
out this top term.",00:06:14.960,00:06:19.240
"So all we have in the numerator
now is just P. It",00:06:19.240,00:06:22.206
"will also cancel out this
exponential in the",00:06:22.206,00:06:25.910
denominator.,00:06:25.910,00:06:27.970
"And then we'll have to change
this here, because it'll have",00:06:27.970,00:06:32.630
"an extra e to the lambda
absolute value of z minus 1.",00:06:32.630,00:06:43.250
 ,00:06:43.250,00:06:46.631
"All right, now let's
rewrite this.",00:06:46.631,00:06:51.190
"And what we get is plus 1 minus
P e to the minus lambda",00:06:51.190,00:07:04.860
"absolute value of z plus
1 minus absolute",00:07:04.860,00:07:09.320
value of z minus 1.,00:07:09.320,00:07:10.900
 ,00:07:10.900,00:07:15.030
"OK, so that is pretty much as
far as you can go in terms of",00:07:15.030,00:07:21.670
simplifying it.,00:07:21.670,00:07:24.370
"And now the question is, are we",00:07:24.370,00:07:27.400
comfortable with this answer?,00:07:27.400,00:07:28.870
"And it helps always to try to
interpret it a little bit, to",00:07:28.870,00:07:31.200
"make sure that it makes
intuitive sense.",00:07:31.200,00:07:34.220
"And one way to do that is to try
to-- some of the limiting",00:07:34.220,00:07:38.230
"cases of what some of the
parameters can be.",00:07:38.230,00:07:39.960
"So in this case, the parameters
are P and lambda.",00:07:39.960,00:07:44.000
"So P is the parameter
related to x.",00:07:44.000,00:07:46.815
"And lambda is the parameter
related to y.",00:07:46.815,00:07:49.050
"So let's try to see if it
makes sense under some",00:07:49.050,00:07:51.380
limiting cases.,00:07:51.380,00:07:53.120
"The first one we want to think
about is when P goes to 0.",00:07:53.120,00:08:01.880
 ,00:08:01.880,00:08:05.470
"So if P goes to 0, what
happens to our answer?",00:08:05.470,00:08:08.560
"Well, the numerator is 0,
this is 0, this is 1.",00:08:08.560,00:08:12.520
"But it doesn't matter, because
the numerator is 0.",00:08:12.520,00:08:14.190
"So in this case, this
would go to 0.",00:08:14.190,00:08:18.630
Now does that make sense?,00:08:18.630,00:08:20.510
"Well, what does that mean
when P goes to 0?",00:08:20.510,00:08:22.980
"When P goes to 0, that means
that the probability that x is",00:08:22.980,00:08:28.320
equal to 1 is 0.,00:08:28.320,00:08:31.580
"So even without thinking about
y or z, there is already a 0",00:08:31.580,00:08:36.309
"probability that x
is equal to 1.",00:08:36.309,00:08:40.130
"Now this whole calculation, what
we found is, well, if I",00:08:40.130,00:08:45.870
"had some more information, like
what z is, does that help",00:08:45.870,00:08:51.870
"me find out what the probability
of x being 1 is?",00:08:51.870,00:08:54.320
"Well, no matter what z tells me,
I know for a fact that x",00:08:54.320,00:08:59.830
"can't be 1, because P is 0.",00:08:59.830,00:09:02.890
"So this posterior, or this
conditional probability,",00:09:02.890,00:09:08.080
"should also be 0, because
there's just no way",00:09:08.080,00:09:12.840
that x can be 1.,00:09:12.840,00:09:15.560
"So in this case, this formula
does check out.",00:09:15.560,00:09:19.530
"Now let's think about another
case where P goes to 1.",00:09:19.530,00:09:24.870
"If P goes to 1, that
means that X is for",00:09:24.870,00:09:30.470
sure going to be 1.,00:09:30.470,00:09:31.510
And it can't be anything else.,00:09:31.510,00:09:33.710
"In which case, what does
our formula tell us?",00:09:33.710,00:09:36.170
"Well, this numerator is 1.",00:09:36.170,00:09:37.970
This term is 1.,00:09:37.970,00:09:39.610
1 minus 1 is 0.,00:09:39.610,00:09:41.320
"So the second term gets zeroed
out, and the answer",00:09:41.320,00:09:44.440
is just 1/1 is 1.,00:09:44.440,00:09:47.710
So what does this tell us?,00:09:47.710,00:09:48.610
"This tells us that if I know
beforehand that x is for sure",00:09:48.610,00:09:53.600
"equal to 1, then, if I now give
myself more information",00:09:53.600,00:09:57.710
"and condition on what I observe
for z, that shouldn't",00:09:57.710,00:10:00.790
change anything else.,00:10:00.790,00:10:01.870
"I should still know for sure
that x is equal to 1.",00:10:01.870,00:10:06.590
"So the probability of this
conditional probability should",00:10:06.590,00:10:10.760
still be equal to 1.,00:10:10.760,00:10:11.940
"And it does, so our formula
also works in this case.",00:10:11.940,00:10:16.760
Now let's think about lambda.,00:10:16.760,00:10:19.090
"What about when lambda
goes to 0?",00:10:19.090,00:10:23.040
"Well, when lambda goes
to 0, that's a",00:10:23.040,00:10:25.330
little harder to visualize.,00:10:25.330,00:10:27.510
"But really, what would happen
is that you can imagine this",00:10:27.510,00:10:39.590
"distribution getting shallower,
shallower and",00:10:39.590,00:10:47.670
"shallower, lower and lower, so
that it's like it is kind of",00:10:47.670,00:10:51.720
flat and goes on forever.,00:10:51.720,00:10:54.870
"And so what this tells you
is that, basically, y--",00:10:54.870,00:11:02.910
"this is the distribution y-- so
when lambda goes to 0, that",00:11:02.910,00:11:05.310
"tells you that y has a really
flat and kind of short",00:11:05.310,00:11:10.680
distribution.,00:11:10.680,00:11:12.250
"And so what does our formula
tell us in this case?",00:11:12.250,00:11:16.210
"Well, when lambda goes to 0,
this exponent is equal to 0.",00:11:16.210,00:11:21.410
And so e to the 0 is 1.,00:11:21.410,00:11:24.080
"So we get P over P plus 1 minus
P, which is just 1.",00:11:24.080,00:11:29.740
"So the answer here, our formula
will give us an answer",00:11:29.740,00:11:33.045
of P.,00:11:33.045,00:11:34.710
So what does that tell us?,00:11:34.710,00:11:36.190
"That tells us that, in this
case, if lambda goes to 0,",00:11:36.190,00:11:39.550
"then our posterior probability,
the probability",00:11:39.550,00:11:43.700
"that x equals 1 conditioned
on z being some value,",00:11:43.700,00:11:48.040
"conditioned on our continuous
measurement, is still P. So",00:11:48.040,00:11:52.520
"the prior, or the original
probability for x being equal",00:11:52.520,00:11:58.410
"to 1 is P. And with this
additional continuous",00:11:58.410,00:12:01.870
"measurement, our guess of the
probability that x equal to 1",00:12:01.870,00:12:08.760
"is still P. So it
hasn't changed.",00:12:08.760,00:12:11.100
"So basically, it's telling
us that this additional",00:12:11.100,00:12:13.280
"information was not
informative.",00:12:13.280,00:12:15.930
"It didn't actually help
us change our beliefs.",00:12:15.930,00:12:19.940
And so why is that?,00:12:19.940,00:12:22.220
"Well, one way to think about
it is that, because the",00:12:22.220,00:12:25.990
"distribution of y looks like
this, is very flat and it",00:12:25.990,00:12:30.180
"could be anything, then, if you
observe some value of z,",00:12:30.180,00:12:36.750
"then it could be that that was
due to the fact that it was x",00:12:36.750,00:12:41.890
"equal to 1 plus some value
of y that made z",00:12:41.890,00:12:45.610
equal to that value.,00:12:45.610,00:12:47.200
"Or it could have just as equally
been likely that x",00:12:47.200,00:12:50.810
"equal to negative 1 y equals to
some other value that made",00:12:50.810,00:12:54.580
it equal to z.,00:12:54.580,00:12:55.990
"And so, essentially, it's z--",00:12:55.990,00:12:58.670
"because y has a shape, it can be
likely to take on any value",00:12:58.670,00:13:05.550
"that complements either x being
equal to 1 or x equal",00:13:05.550,00:13:09.450
"being to negative 1, to make z
equal to whatever the value it",00:13:09.450,00:13:13.410
is that you observe.,00:13:13.410,00:13:15.590
"And so because of that, in
this case, y is not very",00:13:15.590,00:13:18.360
informative.,00:13:18.360,00:13:19.000
"And so this probability is
still just equal to P.",00:13:19.000,00:13:23.610
"Now the last case is when
lambda goes to infinity.",00:13:23.610,00:13:29.570
"And now we have to break
it down into the",00:13:29.570,00:13:32.255
two other cases now.,00:13:32.255,00:13:34.490
The first case is when--,00:13:34.490,00:13:39.610
lets write this over here--,00:13:39.610,00:13:43.630
when lambda goes to infinity.,00:13:43.630,00:13:46.020
"The first case, it depends on
what this value is, the sine",00:13:46.020,00:13:53.730
of this value.,00:13:53.730,00:13:54.580
"If this value, the absolute
value of z plus 1 minus the",00:13:54.580,00:13:57.960
"absolute value of z minus 1,
if that's positive, then,",00:13:57.960,00:14:02.270
"because lambda goes to infinity
and you have a",00:14:02.270,00:14:05.520
"negative sign, then this
entire exponential",00:14:05.520,00:14:08.660
term will go to 0.,00:14:08.660,00:14:11.670
"In which case, the second
term goes to 0.",00:14:11.670,00:14:13.580
"And the answer is
P/P, or is 1.",00:14:13.580,00:14:19.200
"And so if absolute value of z
plus 1 minus absolute value of",00:14:19.200,00:14:28.620
"z minus 1 is greater than
0, then the answer is 1.",00:14:28.620,00:14:34.930
 ,00:14:34.930,00:14:37.480
"But in the other case, if this
term in the exponent, if it's",00:14:37.480,00:14:44.270
"actually negative, if it's
negative, then this negative",00:14:44.270,00:14:50.250
"sign turns to a positive, and
lambda goes to infinity.",00:14:50.250,00:14:52.370
"And so this term blows up, and
it dominates everything else.",00:14:52.370,00:14:56.170
"And so the denominator
goes to infinity.",00:14:56.170,00:14:58.620
"The numerator is fixed at P,
so this entire expression",00:14:58.620,00:15:01.520
would go to 0.,00:15:01.520,00:15:02.770
 ,00:15:02.770,00:15:05.276
"OK, so now let's try to
interpret this case.",00:15:05.276,00:15:09.840
"Let's start with
the first one.",00:15:09.840,00:15:12.000
"When is it that absolute value
of z plus 1 minus absolute",00:15:12.000,00:15:16.310
"value of z minus 1 is
greater than 0?",00:15:16.310,00:15:18.300
"Or you can also rewrite this as
absolute value of z plus 1",00:15:18.300,00:15:24.450
"is greater than absolute
value of z minus 1.",00:15:24.450,00:15:27.926
"Well, when is that case?",00:15:27.926,00:15:29.850
"Well, it turns out, if you think
about it, this is only",00:15:29.850,00:15:32.030
true if z is positive.,00:15:32.030,00:15:35.920
"If z is positive,
then adding 1--",00:15:35.920,00:15:40.010
"let me draw a line here, and
if this is 0-- if z is",00:15:40.010,00:15:43.430
"positive, something here, adding
1 to it and taking the",00:15:43.430,00:15:46.770
absolute value--,00:15:46.770,00:15:47.790
"the absolute value doesn't
do anything--",00:15:47.790,00:15:49.240
"but you will get something
bigger.",00:15:49.240,00:15:52.010
"Where subtracting 1 will take
you closer to 0, and so",00:15:52.010,00:15:55.230
"because of that, the absolute
value, the magnitude, or the",00:15:55.230,00:15:58.490
distance from 0 will be less.,00:15:58.490,00:16:01.750
"Now if you're on the other side,
adding 1 will take you--",00:16:01.750,00:16:07.390
"if you're on the other side,
adding 1 will take",00:16:07.390,00:16:12.020
you closer to 0.,00:16:12.020,00:16:13.940
"And so this magnitude
would be smaller.",00:16:13.940,00:16:16.150
"Whereas, subtracting will take
you farther away, so the",00:16:16.150,00:16:18.570
"absolute value actually
increased the magnitude.",00:16:18.570,00:16:22.040
"And so this is the same
as z being positive.",00:16:22.040,00:16:28.520
"And so this is the same
as z being negative.",00:16:28.520,00:16:33.700
"So what this tells you is that,
if z is positive, then",00:16:33.700,00:16:38.530
"this probability
is equal to 1.",00:16:38.530,00:16:41.410
"And if z is negative, this
probability is equal to 0.",00:16:41.410,00:16:43.610
Now why does that make sense?,00:16:43.610,00:16:45.720
"Well, it's because when lambda
goes to infinity, you have the",00:16:45.720,00:16:49.810
other case.,00:16:49.810,00:16:50.920
"Essentially, you pull this all
the way up, really, really",00:16:50.920,00:16:55.920
"far, and it drops off
really quickly.",00:16:55.920,00:17:08.130
"And so when you take the limit,
as lambda goes to",00:17:08.130,00:17:10.869
"infinity, effectively, it just
becomes a spike at 0.",00:17:10.869,00:17:14.150
"And so, more or less, you're
sure that y is going to be",00:17:14.150,00:17:19.300
equal to 0.,00:17:19.300,00:17:20.420
"And so, effectively, z is
actually going to be equal to",00:17:20.420,00:17:24.240
"x, effectively.",00:17:24.240,00:17:26.859
"And because of that, because x
can only be 1 or negative 1,",00:17:26.859,00:17:32.930
"then, depending on if you get a
z that's positive, then you",00:17:32.930,00:17:37.278
"know for sure that it must
have been that x",00:17:37.278,00:17:40.700
was equal to 1.,00:17:40.700,00:17:42.750
"And if you get a z that's
negative, you know for sure",00:17:42.750,00:17:45.210
"that it must have been that
x was equal to negative 1.",00:17:45.210,00:17:48.990
"And so because of that, you
get this interpretation.",00:17:48.990,00:17:54.820
"And so we've looked at four
different cases of the",00:17:54.820,00:17:59.620
parameters.,00:17:59.620,00:18:00.600
"And in all four cases, our
answer seems to make sense.",00:18:00.600,00:18:04.600
"And so we feel more confident
in the answer.",00:18:04.600,00:18:08.030
"And so to summarize, this whole
problem involved using",00:18:08.030,00:18:12.320
Bayes' rule.,00:18:12.320,00:18:14.290
"You start out with some
distributions, and you apply",00:18:14.290,00:18:18.290
Bayes' rule.,00:18:18.290,00:18:19.860
"And you go through the
steps, and you",00:18:19.860,00:18:21.230
plug-in the right terms.,00:18:21.230,00:18:22.650
"And then, in the end, it's
always helpful to try to check",00:18:22.650,00:18:25.450
"your answers to make sure
that it makes sense",00:18:25.450,00:18:28.270
in some of the limiting.,00:18:28.270,00:18:30.140
