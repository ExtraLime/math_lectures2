"PROFESSOR: So we've
been wondering",00:00:20.500,00:00:23.090
"how a gas, such as
the one in this room,",00:00:23.090,00:00:28.180
"with particles following
Newtonian equations of motion,",00:00:28.180,00:00:32.220
comes to equilibrium.,00:00:32.220,00:00:34.710
"We decided to explain that
by relying on the Boltzmann",00:00:34.710,00:00:39.270
equation.,00:00:39.270,00:00:41.120
"Essentially, we said, let's look
at the density, or probability,",00:00:41.120,00:00:46.190
"that we will find particles
with momentum p at location q",00:00:46.190,00:00:50.180
"at time t, and we found that
within some approximations,",00:00:50.180,00:00:56.190
"we could represent
the evolution of this",00:00:56.190,00:01:00.540
"through a linear operator
on the left-hand side",00:01:00.540,00:01:04.379
"equal to some
collision second order",00:01:04.379,00:01:07.340
operator on the right-hand side.,00:01:07.340,00:01:11.090
"The linear operator is
a bunch of derivatives.",00:01:11.090,00:01:16.255
"There is the time derivative,
then the coordinate moves",00:01:16.255,00:01:22.190
"according to the velocity,
which is P over m.",00:01:22.190,00:01:26.580
"And summation over the index
alpha running from 1 to 3,",00:01:26.580,00:01:31.540
"or x, y, z, is assumed.",00:01:31.540,00:01:34.600
"And at this stage,
there is symmetry",00:01:34.600,00:01:38.940
"within the
representation in terms",00:01:38.940,00:01:40.800
of coordinates and momenta.,00:01:40.800,00:01:42.880
"There is also a force that
causes changes of momentum.",00:01:42.880,00:01:48.420
"Actually, for most
of today, we are",00:01:48.420,00:01:50.860
"going to be interested
in something",00:01:50.860,00:01:53.110
"like the gas in this room
far away from the walls,",00:01:53.110,00:01:56.910
"where essentially there
is no external potential.",00:01:56.910,00:02:00.290
"And for the interest of thinking
about modes such as sound,",00:02:00.290,00:02:04.870
"et cetera, we can remove that.",00:02:04.870,00:02:09.729
"The second order operator-- the
collision operator-- however,",00:02:09.729,00:02:17.940
"explicitly because we were
thinking about collisions",00:02:17.940,00:02:22.350
"among particles that
are taking place",00:02:22.350,00:02:24.390
"when they are in close
contact, breaks the symmetry",00:02:24.390,00:02:27.810
"between coordinate and momenta
that were present here.",00:02:27.810,00:02:31.960
"So this collision
operator was an integral",00:02:31.960,00:02:35.320
"over the momentum of
another particle that",00:02:35.320,00:02:39.640
"would come at some
impact parameter",00:02:39.640,00:02:42.590
"with relative
velocity, and then you",00:02:42.590,00:02:46.050
"had a subtraction due to
collisions, and then addition",00:02:46.050,00:02:53.680
due to reverse collisions.,00:02:53.680,00:02:55.940
"Now, what we said is
because of the way",00:03:03.770,00:03:07.500
"that this symmetry is
broken, we can distinguish",00:03:07.500,00:03:12.100
"between averages in
position and in momentum.",00:03:12.100,00:03:17.550
"For example, typically we
are interested in variations",00:03:17.550,00:03:21.530
of various quantities in space.,00:03:21.530,00:03:24.050
"And so what we can do is
we can define the density,",00:03:24.050,00:03:27.860
"let's say at some
particular point,",00:03:27.860,00:03:30.280
by integrating over momentum.,00:03:30.280,00:03:34.330
"So again, I said I don't
really need too much",00:03:37.550,00:03:40.400
"about the dependence
on momentum,",00:03:40.400,00:03:43.630
"but I really am
interested in how",00:03:43.630,00:03:45.770
"things vary from
position to position.",00:03:45.770,00:03:48.940
"Once we have defined density, we
could define various averages,",00:03:48.940,00:03:53.700
"where we would multiply this
integral by some function of P",00:03:53.700,00:03:57.880
"and q, and the average was
defined in this fashion.",00:03:57.880,00:04:03.630
"What we found was
that really what",00:04:03.630,00:04:07.900
"happens through this collision
operator-- that typically",00:04:07.900,00:04:13.510
"is much more important, as
far as the inverse time scales",00:04:13.510,00:04:17.420
"are concerned, than the
operators on the left,",00:04:17.420,00:04:20.010
"it has a much bigger
magnitude-- is",00:04:20.010,00:04:23.170
"that momenta are very rapidly
exchanged and randomized.",00:04:23.170,00:04:31.890
"And the things that are
randomized most slowly",00:04:31.890,00:04:36.560
"are quantities that are
conserved in collision.",00:04:36.560,00:04:38.853
"And so we focused on quantities
that were collision conserved,",00:04:45.000,00:04:49.870
"and we found that for each
one of these quantities,",00:04:49.870,00:04:53.540
"we could write down some kind
of a hydrodynamic equation.",00:04:53.540,00:04:59.000
"In particular, if we looked
at number conservation--",00:04:59.000,00:05:03.770
"two particles come
in, two particles",00:05:03.770,00:05:05.750
"go out-- we found that the
equation that described that",00:05:05.750,00:05:09.480
"was that the time derivative of
the density plus moving along",00:05:09.480,00:05:18.230
"the streamline had
a special form.",00:05:18.230,00:05:24.480
"And here, I defined the quantity
u alpha, which is simply",00:05:24.480,00:05:32.250
"the average of P alpha
over m, defined in the way",00:05:32.250,00:05:38.077
that averages defined over here.,00:05:38.077,00:05:41.660
"And that this is the
number of particles,",00:05:41.660,00:05:45.520
"how it changes if I move
along the streamline",00:05:45.520,00:05:48.820
"And variations of this,
if you are incompressible,",00:05:48.820,00:05:52.300
"comes from the divergence
of your flow velocity.",00:05:52.300,00:05:58.140
"And actually, this operator we
call the total, or streamline,",00:05:58.140,00:06:03.340
derivative.,00:06:03.340,00:06:03.840
"Now, the next thing
that we said is",00:06:08.040,00:06:09.780
"that OK, number is conserved,
but momentum is also conserved.",00:06:09.780,00:06:13.930
"So we can see what equation
I get if I look at momentum.",00:06:13.930,00:06:19.460
"But in fact, we put
the quantity that",00:06:19.460,00:06:22.180
"was momentum divided by mass
to make it like a velocity,",00:06:22.180,00:06:27.770
"and how much you
deviate from the average",00:06:27.770,00:06:31.190
that we just calculated.,00:06:31.190,00:06:33.630
"And this quantity
we also call c.",00:06:33.630,00:06:38.040
"And when we looked at the
equation that corresponded",00:06:38.040,00:06:42.020
"to the conservation of this
quantity in collisions,",00:06:42.020,00:06:45.290
"we found that we had
something like mass times",00:06:45.290,00:06:51.060
"acceleration along
the streamline.",00:06:51.060,00:06:53.310
"So basically this
operator multiplied",00:06:53.310,00:06:56.160
"by mass acting on this
was external force.",00:06:56.160,00:07:01.770
"Well, currently we've
said this external force",00:07:01.770,00:07:04.500
"to be zero-- so when
we are inside the box.",00:07:04.500,00:07:07.290
"Here there was an
additional force",00:07:07.290,00:07:10.140
"that came from variations
of pressure in the gas.",00:07:10.140,00:07:16.940
"And so we had a term here that
was 1 over n d alpha of P alpha",00:07:16.940,00:07:22.410
"beta, and we needed to define
a pressure tensor P alpha",00:07:22.410,00:07:29.330
"beta, which was nm
expectation line of c alpha c.",00:07:29.330,00:07:36.997
"Finally, in collisions
there is another quantity",00:07:41.400,00:07:45.020
"that is conserved, which
is the kinetic energy.",00:07:45.020,00:07:48.720
"So here the third quantity
could be the kinetic energy--",00:07:48.720,00:07:53.470
"or actually, we chose
the combination mc",00:07:53.470,00:07:56.970
"squared over 2, which is the
additional kinetic energy",00:07:56.970,00:08:02.210
on top of this.,00:08:02.210,00:08:03.260
"And it's very easy to check that
if kinetic energy is conserved,",00:08:03.260,00:08:07.000
this quantity is also conserved.,00:08:07.000,00:08:09.630
"We call the average of
this quantity in the way",00:08:09.630,00:08:13.045
"that we have defined
above as epsilon.",00:08:13.045,00:08:18.850
"And then the
hydrodynamic equation",00:08:18.850,00:08:21.630
"is that as you move
along the streams--",00:08:21.630,00:08:26.536
"so you have this derivative
acting on this quantity",00:08:26.536,00:08:29.800
"epsilon-- what we are going to
get is something like minus 1",00:08:29.800,00:08:35.049
"over n d alpha of a
new vector, h alpha.",00:08:35.049,00:08:41.059
"h alpha, basically, tells me how
this quantity is transported.",00:08:41.059,00:08:50.430
"So all I need to do is to
have something like mc squared",00:08:50.430,00:08:55.900
"over 2 transported
along direction alpha.",00:08:55.900,00:09:01.690
"And then there was
another term, which",00:09:01.690,00:09:04.330
"was P alpha beta-- the
P alpha beta that we",00:09:04.330,00:09:09.040
"defined above--
times u alpha beta.",00:09:09.040,00:09:13.060
"U alpha beta was simply the
derivative of this quantity,",00:09:13.060,00:09:20.100
symmetrized.,00:09:20.100,00:09:20.600
"So the statement
is that something",00:09:28.300,00:09:32.050
"like a gas-- or any
other fluid, in fact-- we",00:09:32.050,00:09:38.270
"can describe through
these quantities that",00:09:38.270,00:09:42.020
"are varying from one
location to another location.",00:09:42.020,00:09:45.265
"There is something
like a density,",00:09:45.265,00:09:47.650
"how dense it is
at this location.",00:09:47.650,00:09:50.030
"How fast particles are
streaming from one location",00:09:50.030,00:09:53.160
to another location.,00:09:53.160,00:09:54.700
"And the energy content
that is ultimately related",00:09:54.700,00:09:57.830
"to something like
the temperature,",00:09:57.830,00:09:59.400
how hot it is locally.,00:09:59.400,00:10:00.681
So you have these equations.,00:10:03.330,00:10:05.770
"Solving these equations,
presumably, is equivalent,",00:10:05.770,00:10:11.340
"in some sense, to solving
the Boltzmann equation.",00:10:11.340,00:10:13.990
"The Boltzmann equation, we
know, ultimately reaches",00:10:13.990,00:10:16.690
"an equilibrium, so we
should be able to figure out",00:10:16.690,00:10:19.870
"how the system, such as
the gas in this room,",00:10:19.870,00:10:22.700
"is if disturbed, comes to
equilibrium, if we follow",00:10:22.700,00:10:26.260
"the density, velocity,
and temperature.",00:10:26.260,00:10:30.930
"Now, the problem with the
equations as I have written",00:10:30.930,00:10:33.940
"is that they are not closed
in terms of these three",00:10:33.940,00:10:37.240
"quantities, because I need
to evaluate the pressure,",00:10:37.240,00:10:43.080
"I need to evaluate the
heat transfer vector.",00:10:43.080,00:10:48.540
"And to calculate
these quantities,",00:10:48.540,00:10:53.040
"I need to be able to
evaluate these averages.",00:10:53.040,00:10:56.420
"In order to evaluate these
averages, I need to know f.",00:10:56.420,00:11:01.920
So how did we proceed?,00:11:01.920,00:11:05.380
"We said well, let's try to find
approximate solutions for f.",00:11:05.380,00:11:10.690
"So the next task
is to find maybe",00:11:10.690,00:11:13.240
"some f, which is a function
of p, q, and t, and we",00:11:13.240,00:11:19.740
can substitute over there.,00:11:19.740,00:11:23.650
"Now, the first
thing that we said",00:11:23.650,00:11:26.340
"was, OK, maybe what I can do
is I can look at the equation",00:11:26.340,00:11:33.300
itself.,00:11:33.300,00:11:35.050
"Notice that this
part of the equation",00:11:35.050,00:11:37.740
"is order of 1 over the
time it takes for particles",00:11:37.740,00:11:41.780
"to move in the gas and
find another particle",00:11:41.780,00:11:44.430
"to collide with, whereas the
left-hand side is presumably",00:11:44.430,00:11:48.430
"something that is
related to how far I",00:11:48.430,00:11:52.510
"go before I see some variation
due to the external box.",00:11:52.510,00:11:57.640
"And we are really thinking about
cases where the gas particles",00:11:57.640,00:12:03.970
"are not that
dilute, in the sense",00:12:03.970,00:12:06.520
"that along the way to go
from one side of the room",00:12:06.520,00:12:09.380
"to another side of the
room, you encounter",00:12:09.380,00:12:11.920
"many, many collisions.",00:12:11.920,00:12:13.930
"So the term on the right-hand
side is much larger.",00:12:13.930,00:12:18.290
"If that is the case,
we said that maybe it's",00:12:18.290,00:12:20.720
"justifiable to just solve this
equation on the right-hand side",00:12:20.720,00:12:25.030
as a zeroth order.,00:12:25.030,00:12:26.970
"And to solve that, I really
have to set, for example,",00:12:26.970,00:12:32.180
"the right-hand side that
I'm integrating here, to 0.",00:12:32.180,00:12:37.490
And I know how to do that.,00:12:37.490,00:12:39.400
"If log f involves collision
conserved quantities,",00:12:39.400,00:12:46.070
"then ff before is
the same as ff after.",00:12:46.070,00:12:50.310
"And the solution
that I get by doing",00:12:50.310,00:12:53.200
"that has the form of exponential
involving conserved quantities,",00:12:53.200,00:13:00.350
"which are the quantities
that I have indicated",00:13:00.350,00:13:02.480
"over here-- let's
say, such as c.",00:13:02.480,00:13:05.350
"And so log of that
would be something",00:13:05.350,00:13:07.590
"that involves--
I can write as mc",00:13:07.590,00:13:10.440
"squared over 2 with
some coefficient",00:13:10.440,00:13:14.210
"that, in principle, varies from
location to another location.",00:13:14.210,00:13:18.534
"I want to integrate this and
come up with the density,",00:13:21.200,00:13:25.980
"so I put the density out here,
and I normalize the Gaussian.",00:13:25.980,00:13:30.460
"And so this is a
reasonable solution.",00:13:35.890,00:13:39.870
"Indeed, this is the
zeroth order solution",00:13:39.870,00:13:44.400
for f-- I'll call that f0.,00:13:44.400,00:13:45.940
"So once you have the
zeroth order solution,",00:13:49.530,00:13:52.810
"from that you can calculate
these two quantities.",00:13:52.810,00:13:55.850
"For example, because the zeroth
order solution is even in c,",00:13:55.850,00:14:01.220
"the heat vector will
be 0, because it",00:14:01.220,00:14:04.620
"is symmetric in the
different components.",00:14:04.620,00:14:07.540
"The pressure tensor will be
proportional to delta alpha",00:14:07.540,00:14:12.710
beta.,00:14:12.710,00:14:15.040
OK?,00:14:15.040,00:14:16.480
We started with that.,00:14:16.480,00:14:18.170
"Put those over
here, and we found",00:14:18.170,00:14:21.740
"that we could get some
results that were interesting.",00:14:21.740,00:14:24.640
"For example, we could see that
the gas can have sound modes.",00:14:24.640,00:14:30.320
"We could calculate
the speed of sound.",00:14:30.320,00:14:32.570
"But these sound modes
were not damped.",00:14:32.570,00:14:35.030
"And there were other modes,
such as sheer modes, that",00:14:35.030,00:14:38.130
"existed forever,
confounding our expectation",00:14:38.130,00:14:41.760
"that these equations
should eventually",00:14:41.760,00:14:44.630
come to an equilibrium.,00:14:44.630,00:14:47.400
"So we said, OK, this
was a good attempt.",00:14:47.400,00:14:50.810
"But what was not good enough to
give us complete equilibrium,",00:14:50.810,00:14:54.660
"so let's try to find
a better solution.",00:14:54.660,00:14:57.820
"So how did we find
the better solution?",00:14:57.820,00:15:00.960
"We said that the
better solution-- let's",00:15:00.960,00:15:04.320
"assume that the
solution is like this,",00:15:04.320,00:15:08.330
"but is slightly changed
by a correction.",00:15:08.330,00:15:14.770
"And the correction comes
because of the effect",00:15:14.770,00:15:17.570
"of the left-hand side,
which we had ignored so far.",00:15:17.570,00:15:21.690
"And since the left-hand
side is smaller",00:15:21.690,00:15:24.620
"than the right-hand side by
a factor involving tau x,",00:15:24.620,00:15:27.970
"presumably the correction
will involve this tau x.",00:15:27.970,00:15:32.490
OK.,00:15:32.490,00:15:32.990
Good?,00:15:32.990,00:15:34.690
"We said that in
order to see that",00:15:34.690,00:15:37.960
"as a correction,
what I need to do",00:15:37.960,00:15:40.990
"is to essentially
linearize this expression.",00:15:40.990,00:15:44.760
"So what we did was we replaced
this f's with f0's 1 plus g,",00:15:44.760,00:15:52.976
"1 plus g, and so forth.",00:15:52.976,00:15:56.850
"The zeroth term, by
construction, is 0.",00:15:56.850,00:16:00.920
"And so if we ignore terms
that are order of g squared,",00:16:00.920,00:16:04.680
"we get something
that is linear in g.",00:16:04.680,00:16:08.553
OK?,00:16:08.553,00:16:09.940
"Now, it's still an
integral operator,",00:16:09.940,00:16:13.190
"but we said let's
approximate that integration",00:16:13.190,00:16:16.920
"and let's do a linearized one
collision time approximation.",00:16:16.920,00:16:31.710
"What that approximation
amounted to was",00:16:31.710,00:16:35.050
"that, independent of what this
deviation is, if we are relaxed",00:16:35.050,00:16:41.010
"to the zeroth order
solution over time scale",00:16:41.010,00:16:44.510
"that is the same, and that
times scale we'll call tau x.",00:16:44.510,00:16:48.280
"So essentially we wrote this
as minus f0, essentially",00:16:48.280,00:16:54.150
"g, which is the difference
between f and f0,",00:16:54.150,00:16:59.830
divided by tau x.,00:16:59.830,00:17:02.670
"f0, this was g.",00:17:05.876,00:17:07.140
No.,00:17:12.829,00:17:13.450
I guess we don't have this.,00:17:13.450,00:17:15.109
We wrote it in this fashion.,00:17:15.109,00:17:18.810
"It's just writing the
way that I wrote before.",00:17:18.810,00:17:21.300
"We wrote this as g
over tau x, where",00:17:21.300,00:17:26.329
"g is the correction that
I have to write here.",00:17:26.329,00:17:30.590
"And you can see that the
correction is obtained",00:17:30.590,00:17:34.120
"by multiplying minus tau x with
l acting on f0 divided by f0,",00:17:34.120,00:17:41.200
which is l acting on log of f0.,00:17:41.200,00:17:45.210
"So I would have
here 1 minus tau x--",00:17:45.210,00:17:50.600
"let's make this curly
bracket-- and then",00:17:50.600,00:17:53.420
"in the bracket over here, I
have to put the action of l",00:17:53.420,00:18:03.740
on the log of f0.,00:18:03.740,00:18:04.770
So I have to-- this is my f0.,00:18:09.020,00:18:12.200
I take its log.,00:18:12.200,00:18:13.320
"So the log will have
minus mc squared",00:18:13.320,00:18:15.600
"over 2 kt and the log
of this combination,",00:18:15.600,00:18:19.900
"and I do d by dt plus P alpha
over m acting on this log,",00:18:19.900,00:18:26.370
"and then a bunch of
algebra will leave you",00:18:26.370,00:18:29.630
to the following answer.,00:18:29.630,00:18:31.450
"Not surprisingly, you're
going to get factors of mkT.",00:18:31.450,00:18:35.900
So you will get m over kT.,00:18:35.900,00:18:39.280
"You get c alpha c beta
minus delta alpha beta",00:18:39.280,00:18:44.380
"c squared over 3 acting on
this rate of strength tensor",00:18:44.380,00:18:50.750
that we have defined over here.,00:18:50.750,00:18:53.160
"And then there are
derivatives that",00:18:53.160,00:18:54.760
"will act on temperature--
because temperature is allowed",00:18:54.760,00:18:58.170
"to vary from position to
position-- so there will be",00:18:58.170,00:19:01.155
"a term that will involve the
derivative of temperature.",00:19:01.155,00:19:06.990
"In fact, it will come in the
form over T c alpha multiplying",00:19:06.990,00:19:12.740
"another combination which is
mc squared over 2kT minus 5/2.",00:19:12.740,00:19:21.530
"Let me see if I got all of
the factors of 1/2 correct.",00:19:21.530,00:19:25.625
Yeah.,00:19:30.430,00:19:30.930
OK.,00:19:35.061,00:19:35.560
So this is the first order term.,00:19:35.560,00:19:37.280
"Presumably, there will be
high order corrections,",00:19:37.280,00:19:40.660
"but this is the improved
solution to the Boltzmann",00:19:40.660,00:19:48.650
"equation beyond the zeroth
order approximation.",00:19:48.650,00:19:53.450
"It's a solution that involves
both sides of the equation now.",00:19:53.450,00:19:58.800
"We relied heavily on
the right-hand side",00:19:58.800,00:20:01.380
"to calculate f0, and we
used the left-hand side--",00:20:01.380,00:20:05.920
"through this log l
acting on log of f0--",00:20:05.920,00:20:09.530
"to get the correction
that is order of tau x",00:20:09.530,00:20:13.300
that is coming to this equation.,00:20:13.300,00:20:14.730
"So now, with this
improved solution,",00:20:17.490,00:20:23.310
"we can go back and re-check
some of the conclusions",00:20:23.310,00:20:27.390
that we had before.,00:20:27.390,00:20:29.830
"So let's, for example, start
by calculating this pressure",00:20:29.830,00:20:35.100
"tensor P alpha beta, and see
how it was made different.",00:20:35.100,00:20:39.550
"So what I need to do is
to calculate this average.",00:20:39.550,00:20:46.050
How do I calculate that average?,00:20:48.620,00:20:51.720
"I essentially multiply this f,
as I have indicated over there,",00:20:51.720,00:20:56.130
"by c alpha c beta, and then
I integrate over all momenta.",00:20:56.130,00:21:01.700
"Essentially, I have
to do integrations",00:21:01.700,00:21:04.110
with this Gaussian weight.,00:21:04.110,00:21:07.700
"So when I do the
average of c alpha",00:21:07.700,00:21:10.690
"c beta with this Gaussian
weight, not surprisingly,",00:21:10.690,00:21:15.230
"I will get the delta
alpha beta, and I",00:21:15.230,00:21:18.640
will get from here kT over m.,00:21:18.640,00:21:21.220
"Multiplying by nm
will give me mkT.",00:21:21.220,00:21:26.340
"So this is the diagonal form,
where the diagonal elements",00:21:26.340,00:21:33.520
are our familiar pressures.,00:21:33.520,00:21:34.995
"So that was the
zeroth order term.",00:21:37.890,00:21:39.510
"Essentially, that's
the 1 over here,",00:21:39.510,00:21:42.320
"multiplying c alpha c
beta before I integrate.",00:21:42.320,00:21:47.340
So that's the 1 in this bracket.,00:21:47.340,00:21:51.130
"But there will be order
of tau x corrections,",00:21:51.130,00:21:54.340
"because I will have to
multiply two more factors of c",00:21:54.340,00:21:58.970
"with the c's that
I have over here.",00:21:58.970,00:22:00.770
"Now, none of these
terms are important,",00:22:03.650,00:22:06.200
"because these are,
again, odd terms.",00:22:06.200,00:22:09.710
"So when I multiply two
c's with three or one c",00:22:09.710,00:22:15.270
the average will be zero.,00:22:15.270,00:22:17.030
"So all of the averages are
really coming from these terms.",00:22:17.030,00:22:21.651
"Now, these terms involve
four factors of c's.",00:22:21.651,00:22:26.170
Right?,00:22:26.170,00:22:26.670
"There's the two c's
that I put out here--",00:22:26.670,00:22:29.240
"and actually, I
really have to think",00:22:29.240,00:22:31.560
"of these as different indices,
let's say nu nu, nu nu.",00:22:31.560,00:22:37.086
"Summation convention
again assumed.",00:22:37.086,00:22:42.410
"And then when I multiply by
c alpha c beta, I will have,",00:22:42.410,00:22:47.380
"essentially, four indices
to play with-- c alpha",00:22:47.380,00:22:49.930
"c beta, c nu c nu.",00:22:49.930,00:22:53.070
"But it's all done with the
Gaussian weight out here.",00:22:53.070,00:22:57.970
"And we showed and
discussed how there",00:22:57.970,00:23:01.520
"was this nice fixed theorem
that enabled you to rapidly",00:23:01.520,00:23:05.550
"calculate these Gaussian
weights with four factors of c,",00:23:05.550,00:23:11.340
"or more factors of c--
doesn't really matter.",00:23:11.340,00:23:14.340
"And so in principle you
know how to do that,",00:23:14.340,00:23:18.130
"and I'll skip the corresponding
algebra and write the answer.",00:23:18.130,00:23:22.250
"It is proportional
to minus tau x.",00:23:22.250,00:23:25.860
"And what it gives you, once
you do these calculations,",00:23:25.860,00:23:29.960
"is a factor of u alpha beta
minus delta alpha beta over 3",00:23:29.960,00:23:37.730
nu gamma gamma.,00:23:37.730,00:23:40.040
"And again, let me make sure
I did not miss out anything.",00:23:40.040,00:23:44.270
"And apparently I missed
out the factor of 2.",00:23:47.100,00:23:49.110
"So really, the only
thing that's happened,",00:24:02.280,00:24:05.370
"once we went and included this
correction, we added this term.",00:24:05.370,00:24:11.060
"But the nice thing
about this term",00:24:11.060,00:24:13.540
"is that potentially, it
has off-diagonal terms.",00:24:13.540,00:24:17.500
"This matrix initially
was completely diagonal.",00:24:17.500,00:24:21.280
"The corrections that
we have calculated",00:24:21.280,00:24:23.760
"are potentially
off-diagonal coming",00:24:23.760,00:24:27.150
"from this term that corrected
the original Gaussian weight.",00:24:27.150,00:24:33.600
So where is that useful?,00:24:33.600,00:24:35.610
"Well, one of the problems
that we discussed",00:24:35.610,00:24:38.490
"was that I can imagine a
configuration of velocities,",00:24:38.490,00:24:43.210
"let's say close to a
wall-- but it does not",00:24:43.210,00:24:46.600
"have to be a wall,
but something where",00:24:46.600,00:24:48.980
"I have a profile
of velocities which",00:24:48.980,00:24:53.730
"exist with components only
along the x direction,",00:24:53.730,00:25:00.060
but vary along the y direction.,00:25:00.060,00:25:03.860
"So this ux is
different from this ux,",00:25:03.860,00:25:06.780
"because they correspond
to different y's.",00:25:06.780,00:25:08.780
"So essentially, this is a
pattern of sheering a gas,",00:25:08.780,00:25:12.680
if you like.,00:25:12.680,00:25:14.910
"And the question is,
well, hopefully, this",00:25:14.910,00:25:19.660
"will come to relax and
eventually give us, let's say,",00:25:19.660,00:25:23.850
"uniform velocity, or zero
velocity, even better--",00:25:23.850,00:25:28.160
"if there's a wall, and
the wall velocity is zero.",00:25:28.160,00:25:32.630
So how does that happen?,00:25:32.630,00:25:34.570
"Well, the equation
that I have to satisfy",00:25:34.570,00:25:38.485
is this one that involves u.,00:25:38.485,00:25:42.290
So I have m.,00:25:42.290,00:25:45.380
"Well, what do I have to have?",00:25:45.380,00:25:46.705
"I have du by dt plus
something that acts on ux.",00:25:46.705,00:25:55.140
"ux only has variations
along the y direction.",00:25:58.690,00:26:02.710
"So this term, if
it was there, had",00:26:02.710,00:26:06.210
"to involve a derivative along
the y direction multiplying uy,",00:26:06.210,00:26:12.370
"but it's not present,
because there's no uy.",00:26:12.370,00:26:14.295
"On the right-hand side of the
equation, I have to put minus 1",00:26:16.970,00:26:21.270
over n.,00:26:21.270,00:26:24.040
"Again, the only variations
that I'm allowed to have",00:26:24.040,00:26:27.560
are along the y direction.,00:26:27.560,00:26:29.110
"So I have, when I do the
summation over alpha,",00:26:29.110,00:26:32.300
"the only alpha that
contributes is y.",00:26:32.300,00:26:35.920
"And so I need the
pressure y, but I'm",00:26:35.920,00:26:39.910
"looking for velocities
along the x direction,",00:26:39.910,00:26:43.010
so the other index better be x.,00:26:43.010,00:26:47.042
OK?,00:26:47.042,00:26:49.020
"So the time course of
the velocity profile",00:26:49.020,00:26:52.490
"that I set up over
here is determined",00:26:52.490,00:26:57.290
"by the y derivative of the
yx component of the pressures",00:26:57.290,00:27:00.960
tensor.,00:27:00.960,00:27:02.960
"Now, previously our
problem was that we stopped",00:27:02.960,00:27:05.400
"at the zeroth order,
and at the zeroth order,",00:27:05.400,00:27:08.270
"the pressure tensor
was diagonal.",00:27:08.270,00:27:10.250
It didn't have a yx component.,00:27:10.250,00:27:12.970
"So this profile
would stay forever.",00:27:12.970,00:27:17.300
"But now we do have a
yx component, and so",00:27:17.300,00:27:22.880
what do I get?,00:27:22.880,00:27:24.250
"I will get here
minus 1 over n dy dy.",00:27:24.250,00:27:30.690
"The yx component will
come from minus 2 tau",00:27:30.690,00:27:35.130
"x multiplying nkT and
then multiplying-- well,",00:27:35.130,00:27:41.900
"this term, again, is diagonal.",00:27:41.900,00:27:44.320
I can forget about that term.,00:27:44.320,00:27:46.210
So it comes from the uxy.,00:27:46.210,00:27:50.360
What is uxy?,00:27:50.360,00:27:51.815
"It is 1/2 of the x derivative
of uy that doesn't exist,",00:27:51.815,00:27:57.480
"and the y derivative
of ux that does exist.",00:27:57.480,00:27:59.968
OK?,00:28:03.952,00:28:05.950
"So what we have,
once we divide by m,",00:28:05.950,00:28:10.420
"is that the time
derivative of ux",00:28:10.420,00:28:14.580
"is given by a bunch
of coefficients.",00:28:14.580,00:28:19.880
"The n I can cancel
if it does not vary.",00:28:19.880,00:28:23.720
What I have is the 2's cancel.,00:28:23.720,00:28:29.370
The n's cancel.,00:28:29.370,00:28:31.420
I will have tau x kT over m.,00:28:31.420,00:28:39.140
"tau x kT over m, that's fine.",00:28:41.890,00:28:44.260
"And then the second derivative
along the y direction of ux.",00:28:44.260,00:28:49.790
"So suddenly, I have
a different equation.",00:28:57.940,00:29:02.170
"Rather than having the time
derivative does not change,",00:29:02.170,00:29:06.870
"I find that the time
derivative of ux",00:29:06.870,00:29:09.650
is proportional to Laplacian.,00:29:09.650,00:29:11.310
It's a diffusion equation.,00:29:11.310,00:29:13.430
"And we know the solution
to the diffusion equation,",00:29:13.430,00:29:15.970
"how it looks qualitative if I
have a profile such as this.",00:29:15.970,00:29:20.110
"Because of the
fusion, eventually it",00:29:20.110,00:29:23.340
"will become more and
more uniform in time.",00:29:23.340,00:29:27.900
"And the characteristic
time over which",00:29:27.900,00:29:30.410
"it does so, if I assume that,
let's say, in the y direction,",00:29:30.410,00:29:34.570
"I have a pattern that has some
characteristic size lambda,",00:29:34.570,00:29:39.080
"then the characteristic
relaxation time for diffusion",00:29:39.080,00:29:44.950
"will be proportional
to lambda squared.",00:29:44.950,00:29:48.160
There's a proportionality here.,00:29:48.160,00:29:50.460
"The constant of
proportionality is simply",00:29:50.460,00:29:53.560
this diffusion coefficient.,00:29:53.560,00:29:55.350
So it is inversely.,00:29:55.350,00:29:57.920
So it is m kT tau x.,00:29:57.920,00:30:02.731
"Actually, we want to
think about it further.",00:30:07.920,00:30:10.840
"kT over m is roughly the square
of the terminal velocities",00:30:10.840,00:30:14.790
of the particles.,00:30:14.790,00:30:16.610
"So lambda squared
divided by v squared",00:30:16.610,00:30:20.890
"is roughly the time that
you would have ballistically",00:30:20.890,00:30:24.490
"traveled over this line
scale of the variation.",00:30:24.490,00:30:28.760
"The square of that
time has to be provided",00:30:28.760,00:30:31.930
"by the characteristic
collision time,",00:30:31.930,00:30:34.740
"and that tells
you the time scale",00:30:34.740,00:30:37.060
"over which this kind
of relaxation occurs.",00:30:37.060,00:30:42.090
Yes?,00:30:42.090,00:30:43.071
"AUDIENCE: So if x
depends linearly, why?",00:30:43.071,00:30:46.999
"Would still get 0
on the-- why can't--",00:30:46.999,00:30:49.340
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:30:51.960,00:30:52.780
"So what you are setting
up is a variation",00:30:52.780,00:30:57.000
"where there is some kind
of a sheer velocity that",00:30:57.000,00:31:00.450
exists forever.,00:31:00.450,00:31:01.930
"So indeed, this
kind of pattern will",00:31:01.930,00:31:05.730
"persist, unless you say
that there's actually",00:31:05.730,00:31:08.530
another wall at the other end.,00:31:08.530,00:31:10.740
"So then you will have
some kind of a pattern",00:31:10.740,00:31:14.500
that you would relax.,00:31:14.500,00:31:15.660
"So unless you're willing to send
this all the way to infinity,",00:31:15.660,00:31:20.140
is will eventually relax.,00:31:20.140,00:31:21.900
Yes?,00:31:26.365,00:31:26.864
"AUDIENCE: Can you just
say again the last term",00:31:26.864,00:31:29.648
"on the second
line, the 1/2 term.",00:31:29.648,00:31:32.281
Where did that come from?,00:31:32.281,00:31:33.322
Can you just explain that?,00:31:33.322,00:31:35.140
PROFESSOR: This term?,00:31:35.140,00:31:36.576
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:31:36.576,00:31:37.201
The last half of it.,00:31:37.201,00:31:38.420
PROFESSOR: The last half of it.,00:31:38.420,00:31:39.711
So what did we have here?,00:31:39.711,00:31:41.210
"So what I have is
that over here,",00:31:41.210,00:31:52.690
"in calculating
the pressure, when",00:31:52.690,00:31:56.210
"I'm looking at the xy
component, I better",00:31:56.210,00:31:59.760
"find some element here
that is off diagonal.",00:31:59.760,00:32:03.530
"What's the off
diagonal element here?",00:32:03.530,00:32:05.620
It is u xy What is u xy?,00:32:05.620,00:32:10.220
"u xy is this, calculated for.",00:32:10.220,00:32:14.160
"So it is 1/2 of dx uy,
which is what I don't have,",00:32:14.160,00:32:19.700
because my uy is 0.,00:32:19.700,00:32:22.150
"And the other half or
it, of symmetrization,",00:32:22.150,00:32:24.090
is 1/2 the value of x.,00:32:24.090,00:32:26.595
Yes?,00:32:26.595,00:32:28.050
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
derivative [INAUDIBLE] for ux.",00:32:28.050,00:32:31.990
"You're starting out
the second term uy uy.",00:32:31.990,00:32:36.240
"Also, shouldn't there
be a term ux dx?",00:32:36.240,00:32:41.360
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:32:41.360,00:32:42.240
Yeah.,00:32:42.240,00:32:42.740
So this is a-- yes.,00:32:42.740,00:32:43.960
"There is a term that
is ux dx, but there",00:32:43.960,00:32:46.810
"is no variation along
the x direction.",00:32:46.810,00:32:49.760
"I said that I set up
a configuration where",00:32:49.760,00:32:52.440
"the only non-zero derivatives
are along the y direction.",00:32:52.440,00:32:56.900
"But in general, yes.",00:32:56.900,00:32:57.900
You are right.,00:32:57.900,00:32:58.483
This is like a divergence.,00:32:58.483,00:33:00.195
"It has three terms, but
the way that I set it up,",00:33:00.195,00:33:03.460
only one term is non-zero.,00:33:03.460,00:33:06.140
"AUDIENCE: Also, if you have
[INAUDIBLE] one layer moving",00:33:06.140,00:33:10.120
"fast at some point, the other
layer moving slower than that.",00:33:10.120,00:33:13.280
"And you potentially can
create some kind of curl?",00:33:13.280,00:33:15.921
"But as far as I understand, this
would be an even higher order",00:33:15.921,00:33:19.470
effect?,00:33:19.470,00:33:19.970
Like turbulence.,00:33:19.970,00:33:22.369
PROFESSOR: You said two things.,00:33:22.369,00:33:23.660
"One of them was you
started saying viscosity.",00:33:23.660,00:33:27.560
"And indeed, what
we've calculated here,",00:33:27.560,00:33:30.240
"this thing is the
coefficient of viscosity.",00:33:30.240,00:33:33.150
"So this is really the
viscosity of the material.",00:33:33.150,00:33:36.450
"So actually, once I
include this term,",00:33:36.450,00:33:41.980
"I have the full the
Navier-Stokes equations",00:33:41.980,00:33:44.960
with viscosity.,00:33:44.960,00:33:46.640
"So all of the
vortices, et cetera,",00:33:46.640,00:33:49.890
"should also be present
and discussed, however",00:33:49.890,00:33:53.000
"way you want to do it with
Navier-Stokes equation",00:33:53.000,00:33:55.880
into this equations.,00:33:55.880,00:33:57.850
"AUDIENCE: So components
of speed which",00:33:57.850,00:34:02.890
"are not just x components,
but other components which",00:34:02.890,00:34:06.730
"are initially zero, will
change because of this, right?",00:34:06.730,00:34:09.757
"PROFESSOR: Yes, that's right.",00:34:09.757,00:34:10.965
That's right.,00:34:10.965,00:34:11.464
"AUDIENCE: You just
haven't introduced them",00:34:11.464,00:34:12.462
in the equation?,00:34:12.462,00:34:13.460
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:34:13.460,00:34:14.085
"So this is I'm looking at the
initial profile in principle.",00:34:14.085,00:34:17.449
"I think here I have
set up something",00:34:17.449,00:34:19.300
"that because of symmetry will
always maintain this equation.",00:34:19.300,00:34:23.020
"But if you put a
little bit bump,",00:34:23.020,00:34:24.850
"if you make some
perturbation, you",00:34:24.850,00:34:26.489
"will certainly generate
other components of velocity.",00:34:26.489,00:34:28.966
OK?,00:34:34.433,00:34:35.929
"And so this resolved one of the
modes that was not relaxing.",00:34:35.929,00:34:40.730
"There was another mode that we
were looking at where I set up",00:34:40.730,00:34:45.710
"a situation where temperature
and density were changing",00:34:45.710,00:34:50.350
"across the system,
but their products--",00:34:50.350,00:34:52.980
"that is, the
pressure-- was uniform.",00:34:52.980,00:34:55.500
"So you had a system
that was always there",00:34:55.500,00:34:58.780
"in the zeroth order, despite
having different temperatures",00:34:58.780,00:35:01.970
at two different points.,00:35:01.970,00:35:03.886
"Well, that was partly
because the heat transport",00:35:03.886,00:35:08.000
vector was zero.,00:35:08.000,00:35:09.912
"Now, if I want to calculate
this with this more complicated",00:35:09.912,00:35:17.290
"equation, well, what I
need-- the problem before",00:35:17.290,00:35:21.090
"with the zeroth order was
that I had three factors of c,",00:35:21.090,00:35:24.110
and that was odd.,00:35:24.110,00:35:25.870
"But now, I have a term in the
equation this is also odd.",00:35:25.870,00:35:30.240
"So from here, I will get
a term, and I will in fact",00:35:30.240,00:35:34.700
"find eventually that
the flow of heat",00:35:34.700,00:35:39.790
"is proportional to
gradient of temperature.",00:35:39.790,00:35:48.020
"And one can compute
this coefficient, again,",00:35:48.020,00:35:51.630
"in terms of mass,
density, et cetera,",00:35:51.630,00:35:54.940
"just like we calculated
this coefficient over here.",00:35:54.940,00:35:57.820
This will give you relaxation.,00:35:57.820,00:36:00.460
"We can also look at the
sound modes including this,",00:36:00.460,00:36:04.310
"and you find that the
wave equation that I",00:36:04.310,00:36:07.130
"had before for the
sound modes will also",00:36:07.130,00:36:09.920
"get a second derivative
term, and that",00:36:09.920,00:36:12.770
"will lead to damping
of the modes of sound.",00:36:12.770,00:36:15.130
"So everything at
this level, now we",00:36:15.130,00:36:18.650
"have some way of seeing
how the gas will eventually",00:36:18.650,00:36:23.180
come to equilibrium.,00:36:23.180,00:36:24.820
"And given some knowledge of
rough parameters of the gas,",00:36:24.820,00:36:29.460
"like-- and most
importantly-- what's",00:36:29.460,00:36:31.360
"the time between
collisions, we can",00:36:31.360,00:36:33.570
"compute the typical relaxation
time, and the relaxation manner",00:36:33.570,00:36:38.510
of the gas.,00:36:38.510,00:36:39.250
"So we are now going to
change directions, and forget",00:36:53.230,00:36:56.820
about time dependents.,00:36:56.820,00:36:59.360
"So if you have questions
about this section,",00:36:59.360,00:37:02.330
now may be a good time.,00:37:02.330,00:37:04.573
Yes?,00:37:04.573,00:37:05.072
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what is lambda?",00:37:05.072,00:37:07.087
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:37:07.087,00:37:07.670
"So I assume that
what I have to do",00:37:07.670,00:37:11.420
"is to solve the equation
for some initial condition.",00:37:11.420,00:37:15.940
"Let's imagine that that
initial condition, let's say,",00:37:15.940,00:37:18.860
"is a periodic pattern of
some wavelength lambda.",00:37:18.860,00:37:22.380
"Or it could be any
other shape that",00:37:22.380,00:37:24.460
"has some characteristic
dimension.",00:37:24.460,00:37:26.880
"The important thing is
that the diffusion constant",00:37:26.880,00:37:30.750
"has units of length
squared over time.",00:37:30.750,00:37:35.580
"So eventually, you'll
find that all times are",00:37:35.580,00:37:39.440
"proportional to
some lengths where",00:37:39.440,00:37:41.740
"times the inverse of
the diffusion constant.",00:37:41.740,00:37:44.590
"And so you have to look
at your initial system",00:37:44.590,00:37:47.380
"that you want to relax, identify
the longest length scale that",00:37:47.380,00:37:51.830
"is involved, and then
your relaxation time",00:37:51.830,00:37:54.590
would be roughly of that order.,00:37:54.590,00:37:56.473
OK.,00:38:05.611,00:38:06.110
"So now we get to
the fourth section",00:38:06.110,00:38:11.340
"of our course,
that eventually has",00:38:11.340,00:38:14.620
"to do with
statistical mechanics.",00:38:14.620,00:38:16.280
"And at the very,
very first lecture,",00:38:22.170,00:38:26.080
"I wrote the definition for
you that I will write again,",00:38:26.080,00:38:32.150
"that statistical mechanics
is a probabilistic approach",00:38:32.150,00:38:42.620
"to equilibrium-- also
microscopic-- properties",00:38:42.620,00:38:58.270
"of large numbers of
degrees of freedom.",00:38:58.270,00:39:05.750
"So what we did to
thermodynamics was",00:39:16.690,00:39:21.650
"to identify what equilibrium
microscopic properties are.",00:39:21.650,00:39:28.390
"They are things such as
identifying the energy, volume,",00:39:28.390,00:39:33.520
number of particles of the gas.,00:39:33.520,00:39:36.480
"There could be other things,
such as temperature, pressure,",00:39:36.480,00:39:40.240
"number, or other
collections of variables",00:39:40.240,00:39:45.460
"that are independently
sufficient to describe",00:39:45.460,00:39:48.830
a macrostate.,00:39:48.830,00:39:50.570
"And what we're going to do is
to indicate that macroscopic set",00:39:50.570,00:39:58.480
"of parameters that
thermodynamically characterize",00:39:58.480,00:40:02.160
"the equilibrium
system by big M. OK?",00:40:02.160,00:40:07.030
"Clearly, for a
probabilistic approach,",00:40:10.000,00:40:14.150
"you want to know something
about the probability.",00:40:14.150,00:40:18.000
"And we saw that probabilities
involving large numbers--",00:40:18.000,00:40:26.700
"and actually various things
involving large numbers--",00:40:26.700,00:40:29.930
"had some simplified character
that we are going to exploit.",00:40:29.930,00:40:34.095
"And lastly, in the
last section, we",00:40:37.200,00:40:39.850
"have been thinking about
microscopic description.",00:40:39.850,00:40:45.040
"So these large number
of degrees of freedom",00:40:45.040,00:40:47.620
"we said identify
some point, let's",00:40:47.620,00:40:50.560
"say, for particles in a six-n
dimensional phase space.",00:40:50.560,00:40:55.540
"So this would for gas particles
be this collection p and q.",00:40:55.540,00:41:02.450
"And that these
quantities we know",00:41:02.450,00:41:07.260
"are in fact subject
to dynamics that",00:41:07.260,00:41:10.860
is governed by some Hamiltonian.,00:41:10.860,00:41:14.810
"And we saw that
if we sort of look",00:41:14.810,00:41:19.810
"at the entirety of the
probability in this six",00:41:19.810,00:41:23.900
"n dimensional phase
space, that it",00:41:23.900,00:41:26.640
"is subject to
Liouville's question that",00:41:26.640,00:41:29.590
"said that dp by dt is a
Poisson bracket of H and p.",00:41:29.590,00:41:35.953
"And if the only thing that
we take from equilibrium",00:41:41.850,00:41:47.180
"is that things should not
change as a function of time,",00:41:47.180,00:41:52.220
"then requiring this
probability in phase space",00:41:52.220,00:41:55.280
"to be independent
of time would then",00:41:55.280,00:41:58.910
"require us to have a p which
is a function of H, which",00:41:58.910,00:42:05.240
"is defined in p and
q and potentially",00:42:05.240,00:42:09.046
other conserved quantities.,00:42:09.046,00:42:10.170
"So what we are going to do
in statistical mechanics",00:42:15.850,00:42:21.270
"is to forget about how things
eventually reach equilibrium.",00:42:21.270,00:42:26.830
"We spent a lot of time
and energy thinking",00:42:26.830,00:42:30.230
"about how a gas
reaches equilibrium.",00:42:30.230,00:42:33.060
"Having established
what it requires",00:42:33.060,00:42:36.320
"to devise that solution
in one particular case,",00:42:36.320,00:42:40.690
"and one of few cases where
you can actually get far,",00:42:40.690,00:42:44.450
you're going to ignore that.,00:42:44.450,00:42:45.640
"We say that somehow my system
reached this state that",00:42:45.640,00:42:49.250
"is time independent
and is equilibrium,",00:42:49.250,00:42:52.270
"and therefore the
probability should somehow",00:42:52.270,00:42:55.390
have this character.,00:42:55.390,00:42:57.280
"And it depends,
however, on what choice",00:42:57.280,00:43:01.460
I make for the macrostate.,00:43:01.460,00:43:04.380
"So what I need here-- this was
a probability of a microstate.",00:43:04.380,00:43:09.160
"So what I want to do
is to have a statement",00:43:09.160,00:43:12.820
"about the probability
of a microstate given",00:43:12.820,00:43:15.740
"some specification
of the macrostate",00:43:15.740,00:43:18.820
that I'm interested in.,00:43:18.820,00:43:21.570
So that's the task.,00:43:21.570,00:43:22.690
"And you're going to do that
first in the ensemble--",00:43:26.840,00:43:33.750
"and I'll tell you again
what ensemble means shortly.",00:43:33.750,00:43:37.062
That's called microcanonical.,00:43:37.062,00:43:38.270
"And if you recall, when we
were constructing our approach",00:43:48.110,00:43:54.830
"to thermodynamics, one of the
first things that we did was we",00:43:54.830,00:43:59.580
"said, there's a whole bunch
of things that we don't know,",00:43:59.580,00:44:02.580
"so let's imagine that our
box is as simple as possible.",00:44:02.580,00:44:07.440
"So the system that
we are looking",00:44:07.440,00:44:10.170
"is completely isolated from
the rest of the universe.",00:44:10.170,00:44:14.070
It's a box.,00:44:14.070,00:44:14.910
"There's lots of
things in the box.",00:44:14.910,00:44:17.010
"But the box has no contact
with the rest of the universe.",00:44:17.010,00:44:20.940
"So that was the case
where essentially there",00:44:20.940,00:44:23.630
"was no heat, no work that
was going into the system",00:44:23.630,00:44:28.080
"and was being exchanged,
and so clearly",00:44:28.080,00:44:30.810
"this system has a
constant energy.",00:44:30.810,00:44:32.670
"And so you can certainly
prescribe a particular energy",00:44:35.600,00:44:43.520
"content to whatever
is in the box.",00:44:43.520,00:44:47.110
"And that's the chief identity
of the microcanonical ensemble.",00:44:47.110,00:44:53.450
"It's basically a
collection of boxes",00:44:53.450,00:44:56.650
"that represent the
same equilibrium.",00:44:56.650,00:44:59.290
"So if there is
essentially a gas,",00:44:59.290,00:45:04.420
"the volume is
fixed, so that there",00:45:04.420,00:45:06.110
"would be no work
that will be done.",00:45:06.110,00:45:08.940
"The number of
particles is fixed,",00:45:08.940,00:45:10.630
"so that there is no chemical
work that is being done.",00:45:10.630,00:45:13.550
"So essentially, in general,
all of the quantities",00:45:13.550,00:45:18.140
"that we identified
with displacements",00:45:18.140,00:45:22.070
"are held fixed, as well as
the energy in this ensemble.",00:45:22.070,00:45:28.100
"So the microcanonical
ensemble would",00:45:28.100,00:45:31.540
"be essentially E, x, and N
would be the quantities that",00:45:31.540,00:45:38.310
"parametrize the
equilibrium state.",00:45:38.310,00:45:40.660
"Of course, there's
a whole collection",00:45:40.660,00:45:42.700
"of different microstates
that would correspond",00:45:42.700,00:45:45.210
to the same macrostate here.,00:45:45.210,00:45:49.310
"So presumably, this bunch of
particles that are inside this",00:45:49.310,00:45:59.590
"explore a huge
multidimensional microstate.",00:45:59.590,00:46:04.560
"And what I want to do is to
assign a probability that,",00:46:04.560,00:46:09.320
"given that I have
fixed E, x, and n,",00:46:09.320,00:46:13.540
"that a particular
microstate occurs.",00:46:13.540,00:46:17.210
OK?,00:46:17.210,00:46:18.150
How do I do that?,00:46:18.150,00:46:20.210
"Well, I say that OK, if the
energy of that microstate",00:46:20.210,00:46:27.940
"that I can calculate is not
equal to the energy that I know",00:46:27.940,00:46:33.350
"I have in the box,
then that's not",00:46:33.350,00:46:36.320
"one of the microstates that
should be allowed in the box.",00:46:36.320,00:46:38.890
"But presumably there's a
whole bunch of micro states",00:46:41.810,00:46:47.030
"whose energy is
compatible with the energy",00:46:47.030,00:46:50.530
that I put in the box.,00:46:50.530,00:46:52.980
"And then I say, OK, if there is
no other conserved quantity--",00:46:52.980,00:46:57.715
"and let's assume that there
isn't-- I have no way a priori",00:46:57.715,00:47:02.850
of distinguishing between them.,00:47:02.850,00:47:05.200
"So they are just like
the faces of the dice,",00:47:05.200,00:47:08.000
"and I say they're
all equally likely.",00:47:08.000,00:47:10.770
"For the dice, I
would give 1/6 here.",00:47:10.770,00:47:14.220
"There's presumably some
kind of a normalization that",00:47:14.220,00:47:16.470
"depends on E, x, and n,
that I have to put in.",00:47:16.470,00:47:23.420
"And again, note
that this is kind",00:47:23.420,00:47:26.420
"of like a delta
function that I have.",00:47:26.420,00:47:31.050
"It's like a delta of H
minus E, and it's therefore",00:47:31.050,00:47:33.870
"consistent with this
Liouville equation.",00:47:33.870,00:47:37.310
"It's one of these
functions that is related",00:47:37.310,00:47:41.410
"through H to the probability
on the microstate.",00:47:41.410,00:47:45.250
"Now, this is an assumption.",00:47:48.560,00:47:51.550
"It is a way of
assigning probabilities.",00:47:51.550,00:47:56.840
"It's called assumption of
equal a priori probabilities.",00:47:56.840,00:48:06.200
"It's like the subjective
assignment of probabilities",00:48:06.200,00:48:09.140
"and like the faces
of the dice, it's",00:48:09.140,00:48:11.420
"essentially the
best that you can",00:48:11.420,00:48:13.750
"do without any
other information.",00:48:13.750,00:48:18.140
"Now, the statement is that once
I have made this assumption,",00:48:18.140,00:48:24.710
"I can derive the three
laws of thermodynamics.",00:48:24.710,00:48:28.090
"No, sorry.",00:48:28.090,00:48:28.590
"I can derive two of the
three laws of thermodynamics.",00:48:28.590,00:48:33.220
"Actually, three of the four
laws of thermodynamics, since we",00:48:33.220,00:48:36.970
had the zeroth law.,00:48:36.970,00:48:37.990
So let's proceed.,00:48:37.990,00:48:40.550
OK?,00:48:40.550,00:48:41.530
"So we want to have a
proof of thermodynamics.",00:48:41.530,00:48:46.585
"So the zeroth law
had something to do",00:49:04.650,00:49:07.350
"with putting two
systems in contact,",00:49:07.350,00:49:10.610
"and when they were
in equilibrium,",00:49:10.610,00:49:13.560
"there was some empirical
temperature from one",00:49:13.560,00:49:16.520
"that was the same as what
you had for the other one.",00:49:16.520,00:49:20.270
"So basically, let's
pick our two systems",00:49:20.270,00:49:25.350
"and put a wall between them that
allows the exchange of energy.",00:49:25.350,00:49:32.375
"And so this is my
system one, and they",00:49:35.500,00:49:40.140
have an spontaneous energy bond.,00:49:40.140,00:49:43.950
"This is the part that is
two, it has energy E2.",00:49:43.950,00:49:47.160
"So I start with an initial state
where when I look at E2 and E2,",00:49:49.830,00:50:01.360
"I have some initial value of
E1, 0, let's say, and E2, 0.",00:50:01.360,00:50:07.350
"So my initial state
is here, in these two.",00:50:10.170,00:50:15.660
"Now, as I proceed in time,
because the two systems can",00:50:15.660,00:50:20.760
"exchange energy, E1
and E2 can change.",00:50:20.760,00:50:25.320
"But certainly, what I have is
that E1 plus E2 is something E",00:50:25.320,00:50:31.080
"total that is E1,0 plus E2,0.",00:50:31.080,00:50:36.590
"Which means that I'm
always exploring the line",00:50:36.590,00:50:41.700
"that corresponds to E1 plus
E2 is a constant, which",00:50:41.700,00:50:45.380
"it runs by 45-degree
along this space.",00:50:45.380,00:50:47.961
"So once I remove the
constraint that E1 is fixed",00:50:53.260,00:50:59.750
"and E2 is fixed,
they can exchange.",00:50:59.750,00:51:02.050
"They explore a whole
bunch of other states",00:51:02.050,00:51:05.830
that is available to them.,00:51:05.830,00:51:08.030
"And I would probably
say that the probability",00:51:08.030,00:51:12.480
"of the microstates is the same
up to some normalization that",00:51:12.480,00:51:18.610
comes from E1.,00:51:18.610,00:51:28.360
"So the normalization-- not
the entirety 1 plus 2--",00:51:28.360,00:51:32.640
"is a microcanonical ensemble
but with energy E total.",00:51:32.640,00:51:37.210
"So there is a
corresponding omega",00:51:37.210,00:51:41.320
"that is associated with
the combined system.",00:51:41.320,00:51:44.740
"And to obtain that,
all I need to do",00:51:44.740,00:51:48.170
"is to sum or integrate
over the energy, let's",00:51:48.170,00:51:52.540
"say, that I have
in the first one.",00:51:52.540,00:51:55.220
"The number of states
that I would have,",00:51:55.220,00:51:58.230
"or the volume of
phase space that I",00:51:58.230,00:52:00.020
"would have if I
was at E1, and then",00:52:00.020,00:52:06.980
"simultaneously multiplying by
how many states the second part",00:52:06.980,00:52:12.850
"can have at the energy
that corresponds",00:52:12.850,00:52:15.390
to E total minus E1.,00:52:15.390,00:52:17.492
"So what I need to do is
to essentially multiply",00:52:22.220,00:52:27.770
"the number of states that I
would encounter going along",00:52:27.770,00:52:31.560
"this axis, and the
number of states",00:52:31.560,00:52:34.790
"that I would multiply
going along the other axis.",00:52:34.790,00:52:37.690
"So let's try to sort of
indicate those things",00:52:37.690,00:52:40.980
"with some kind of
a color density.",00:52:40.980,00:52:45.250
"So let's say that the
density is kind of low here,",00:52:45.250,00:52:50.100
"it comes kind of high here,
and then goes low here.",00:52:50.100,00:52:54.500
"If I move along this axis,
let's say that along this axis,",00:52:54.500,00:52:59.360
"I maybe become high here,
and stay high, and then",00:52:59.360,00:53:04.740
become low later.,00:53:04.740,00:53:06.070
Some kind of thing.,00:53:06.070,00:53:07.610
"So all I need to do is to
multiply these two colors",00:53:07.610,00:53:11.370
"and generate the
color along this--",00:53:11.370,00:53:13.640
"there is this direction, which
I will plot going, hopefully,",00:53:13.640,00:53:17.980
coming out of the board.,00:53:17.980,00:53:19.190
"And maybe that product
looks something like this.",00:53:19.190,00:53:21.630
"Stating that somewhere there
is a most probable state,",00:53:25.280,00:53:33.013
"and I can indicate the most
probable state by E1 star",00:53:33.013,00:53:40.250
"and E2 star, let's say.",00:53:40.250,00:53:41.955
"So you may say, OK,
it actually could",00:53:46.940,00:53:49.170
"be something, who says it
should have one maximum.",00:53:49.170,00:53:52.010
"It could have multiple
maxima, or things like that.",00:53:52.010,00:53:54.520
"You could certainly allow
all kinds of things.",00:53:54.520,00:53:56.510
"Now, my claim is that
when I go and rely",00:53:59.080,00:54:03.440
"on this particular
limit, I can state",00:54:03.440,00:54:10.770
"that if I explore
all of these states,",00:54:10.770,00:54:15.710
"I will find my system in the
vicinity of these energies",00:54:15.710,00:54:20.300
"with probability that in
the n goes to infinity,",00:54:20.300,00:54:23.070
limit becomes 1.,00:54:23.070,00:54:26.590
"And that kind of
relies on the fact",00:54:26.590,00:54:30.230
"that each one of
these quantities",00:54:30.230,00:54:33.340
"is really an exponentially
large quantity.",00:54:33.340,00:54:37.480
"Before I do that, I
forgot to do something",00:54:37.480,00:54:41.620
that I wanted to do over here.,00:54:41.620,00:54:44.250
"I have promised that as
we go through the course,",00:54:44.250,00:54:47.130
"at each stage we will
define for each section",00:54:47.130,00:54:50.870
its own definition of entropy.,00:54:50.870,00:54:53.620
"Well, almost, but
not quite that.",00:54:53.620,00:54:57.050
"Once I have a probability,
I had told you",00:54:57.050,00:55:00.700
"how to define an entropy
associated with a probability.",00:55:00.700,00:55:05.080
"So here, I can say that
when I have a probability p,",00:55:05.080,00:55:09.950
"I can identify the average of
log p, the factor of minus p",00:55:09.950,00:55:15.920
"log p, to be the entropy
of that probability.",00:55:15.920,00:55:21.870
"Kind of linked to what we
had for mixing entropy,",00:55:21.870,00:55:27.180
"except that in
thermodynamics, entropy",00:55:27.180,00:55:31.260
had some particular units.,00:55:31.260,00:55:33.690
"It was related to
heat or temperature.",00:55:33.690,00:55:37.260
"So we multiplied
by a quantity kb",00:55:37.260,00:55:41.210
"that has the right
units of energy",00:55:41.210,00:55:44.440
divided by degrees Kelvin.,00:55:44.440,00:55:47.360
"Now, for the choice of the
probability that we have,",00:55:47.360,00:55:51.340
"it is kind of like a
step function in energy.",00:55:51.340,00:55:55.510
"The probability is
either 0 or 1 over omega.",00:55:55.510,00:56:01.260
"So when you're at 0, this
p log p will give you a 0.",00:56:01.260,00:56:04.870
"When you're over here, p log
p will give you log of omega.",00:56:04.870,00:56:08.730
"So this is going to give
you kb log of omega.",00:56:08.730,00:56:14.630
"So we can identify in the
macrocanonical ensemble,",00:56:14.630,00:56:20.980
"once we've stated
what E, x, and n are,",00:56:20.980,00:56:25.610
"what the analog
of the six that we",00:56:25.610,00:56:27.930
"have for the throwing
of the dices, what's",00:56:27.930,00:56:32.430
"the number of microstates that
are compatible with the energy.",00:56:32.430,00:56:37.340
"We will have to do a little bit
of massaging that to understand",00:56:37.340,00:56:40.580
"what that means in
the continuum limit.",00:56:40.580,00:56:42.880
We'll fix that.,00:56:42.880,00:56:44.200
"But once we know that
number, essentially the log",00:56:44.200,00:56:47.380
"of that number up
to a factor would",00:56:47.380,00:56:50.110
"give something that would be
the entropy of that probability",00:56:50.110,00:56:53.670
"that eventually we're
going to identify",00:56:53.670,00:56:56.520
"with the thermodynamic
entropy that",00:56:56.520,00:57:00.130
corresponds to this system.,00:57:00.130,00:57:02.470
"But having done
that definition, I",00:57:02.470,00:57:04.620
"can rewrite this quantity
as E1 e to the 1 over kb S1",00:57:04.620,00:57:12.860
plus 1 over kb S2.,00:57:12.860,00:57:17.520
This one is evaluated at E1.,00:57:17.520,00:57:20.280
"This one is evaluated at E2,
which is E total minus E1.",00:57:20.280,00:57:26.029
"Now, the statement that we are
going to gradually build upon",00:57:33.020,00:57:37.450
"is that these omegas are
these types of quantities",00:57:37.450,00:57:43.600
"that I mentioned that
depend exponentially",00:57:43.600,00:57:47.650
on the number of particles.,00:57:47.650,00:57:49.900
"So let's say, if you just think
about volume, one particle",00:57:49.900,00:57:53.620
"then, can be anywhere in this.",00:57:53.620,00:57:55.520
"So that's a factor of v.
Two particles, v squared.",00:57:55.520,00:57:58.550
"Three particles, v cubed.",00:57:58.550,00:58:00.050
"n particles, v to the n.",00:58:00.050,00:58:02.640
"So these omegas
have buried in them",00:58:02.640,00:58:05.640
an exponential dependence on n.,00:58:05.640,00:58:08.130
"When you take the log, these are
quantities that are extensing.",00:58:08.130,00:58:12.150
"They're proportionate
to this number",00:58:12.150,00:58:14.500
n that becomes very large.,00:58:14.500,00:58:17.450
"So this is one of
those examples where",00:58:17.450,00:58:20.380
"to calculate this
omega in total,",00:58:20.380,00:58:23.760
"I have to evaluate an integral
where the quantities are",00:58:23.760,00:58:29.080
exponentially large.,00:58:29.080,00:58:31.590
"And we saw that
when that happens,",00:58:31.590,00:58:34.440
"I could replace this
integral essentially,",00:58:34.440,00:58:38.220
with its largest value.,00:58:38.220,00:58:39.690
"So I would have 1 over kb S1
of E1 star plus S2 of E2 star.",00:58:39.690,00:58:50.000
"Now, how do I identify where
E1 star and E2 star are?",00:58:57.140,00:59:03.540
"Well, given that I scale along
this axis or along that axis,",00:59:03.540,00:59:09.220
"essentially I want
to find locations",00:59:09.220,00:59:12.400
"where the exponent
is the largest.",00:59:12.400,00:59:15.540
"So how do I find
those locations?",00:59:15.540,00:59:17.520
"I essentially set
the derivative to 0.",00:59:17.520,00:59:20.490
"So if I take the derivative
of this with respect to E1,",00:59:20.490,00:59:23.840
what do I get?,00:59:23.840,00:59:24.470
I get dS1 by dE1.,00:59:24.470,00:59:28.722
"And from here, I
get dS2 with respect",00:59:28.722,00:59:32.790
"to an argument that is
in fact has a minus E1,",00:59:32.790,00:59:37.670
"so I would have minus dS2 with
respect to its own energy.",00:59:37.670,00:59:43.500
"With respect to its
own energy argument,",00:59:43.500,00:59:45.600
"but evaluated with
an energy argument",00:59:45.600,00:59:48.070
that goes opposite way with E1.,00:59:48.070,00:59:51.030
"And all of these are
calculated at conditions",00:59:51.030,00:59:54.410
"where the corresponding
x's and n's are fixed.",00:59:54.410,00:59:56.980
"And this has to
be 0, which means",01:00:02.570,01:00:05.360
"that at the maxima, essentially,
I would have this condition.",01:00:05.360,01:00:10.420
"So again, because of the
exponential character,",01:00:13.850,01:00:21.020
"there could be multiple
of these maxima.",01:00:21.020,01:00:25.100
"But if one of them
is slightly larger",01:00:25.100,01:00:28.940
"than the other in
absolute terms,",01:00:28.940,01:00:33.050
"in terms of the
intensive quantities,",01:00:33.050,01:00:35.800
"once I multiply by
these n's, it will",01:00:35.800,01:00:38.850
"be exponentially
larger than the others.",01:00:38.850,01:00:40.905
"We sort of discussed that when
we were doing the saddle point",01:00:40.905,01:00:44.090
"approximation, how essentially
the best maximum is",01:00:44.090,01:00:48.690
"exponentially larger
than all the others.",01:00:48.690,01:00:51.610
"And so in that sense, it is
exponentially much more likely",01:00:51.610,01:00:55.400
"that you would be here
as opposed to here",01:00:55.400,01:00:58.320
and anywhere else.,01:00:58.320,01:01:00.500
"So the statement, again, is that
just a matter of probabilities.",01:01:00.500,01:01:04.970
"I don't say what's the dynamics
by which the energies can",01:01:04.970,01:01:08.530
explore these two axes.,01:01:08.530,01:01:11.230
"But I imagine like
shuffling cards,",01:01:11.230,01:01:13.990
"the red and the black cards
have been mixed sufficiently,",01:01:13.990,01:01:19.350
"and then you ask
a question about",01:01:19.350,01:01:21.180
the typical configuration.,01:01:21.180,01:01:23.200
"And in typical
configurations, you",01:01:23.200,01:01:25.160
"don't expect a run of ten
black cards, or whatever,",01:01:25.160,01:01:27.960
"because they're
exponentially unlikely.",01:01:27.960,01:01:31.370
"So this is the same
statement, that once you",01:01:31.370,01:01:34.000
"allow this system to equilibrate
its energy, after a while",01:01:34.000,01:01:38.150
"you look at it, and
with probability 1",01:01:38.150,01:01:40.990
"you will find it
at a location where",01:01:40.990,01:01:44.960
these derivatives are the same.,01:01:44.960,01:01:47.980
"Now, each one of
these derivatives",01:01:47.980,01:01:49.800
"is completely something that
pertains to its own system,",01:01:49.800,01:01:54.340
so one of them could be a gas.,01:01:54.340,01:01:55.930
The other could be a spring.,01:01:55.930,01:01:57.220
It could be anything.,01:01:57.220,01:01:59.170
"And these derivatives could
be very different quantities.",01:01:59.170,01:02:02.260
But this equality would hold.,01:02:02.260,01:02:04.520
"And that is what we
have for the zeroth law.",01:02:04.520,01:02:08.600
"That when systems come
into equilibrium, there",01:02:08.600,01:02:11.710
"is a function of
parameters of one",01:02:11.710,01:02:14.990
"that has to be the same as
the function of the parameters",01:02:14.990,01:02:18.300
"of the other, which we call
the empirical temperature.",01:02:18.300,01:02:20.850
"So in principal, we could define
any function of temperature,",01:02:27.420,01:02:35.070
"and in practice, for
consistently, that function",01:02:35.070,01:02:39.090
is one over the temperature.,01:02:39.090,01:02:40.415
"So the zeroth law
established that exists",01:02:49.680,01:02:55.670
this empirical function.,01:02:55.670,01:02:58.490
"This choice of 1
over T is so that we",01:02:58.490,01:03:01.340
"are aligned with
everything else that we",01:03:01.340,01:03:04.000
"have done so far, as
we will see shortly.",01:03:04.000,01:03:06.310
OK?,01:03:09.020,01:03:10.390
"The next thing is
the first law, which",01:03:10.390,01:03:14.670
"had something to
do with the change",01:03:14.670,01:03:18.690
in the energy of the system.,01:03:18.690,01:03:20.280
"When we go from one
state to another state",01:03:20.280,01:03:22.460
"had to be made up by a
combination of heat and work.",01:03:22.460,01:03:28.240
"So for this, let's
expand our system",01:03:28.240,01:03:31.900
to allow some kind of work.,01:03:31.900,01:03:35.060
"So let's imagine that
I have something--",01:03:35.060,01:03:39.280
"let's say if it is a gas-- and
the quantity that would change",01:03:39.280,01:03:45.740
"if there's work done on
the gas is the volume.",01:03:45.740,01:03:49.020
"So let's imagine that there
is a piston that can slide.",01:03:49.020,01:03:53.340
"And this piston exerts
for the gas a pressure,",01:03:53.340,01:03:57.510
"or in general, whatever
the conjugate variable",01:03:57.510,01:04:00.540
"is to the displacement that's
we now allow to change.",01:04:00.540,01:04:04.610
"So there's potentially a
change in the displacement.",01:04:04.610,01:04:09.270
"So what we are doing
is there's work",01:04:09.270,01:04:12.730
"that is done that
corresponds to j delta x.",01:04:12.730,01:04:18.050
"So what happens if this
j delta x amount of work",01:04:18.050,01:04:27.440
is done on the system?,01:04:27.440,01:04:29.610
"Then the system goes from
one configuration that",01:04:29.610,01:04:33.480
"is characterized by x to
another configuration that",01:04:33.480,01:04:36.270
"is characterized
by x plus delta x.",01:04:36.270,01:04:39.920
"And let's see what the change
in entropy is when that happens.",01:04:39.920,01:04:48.040
"Change in entropy, or the
log of the number of states",01:04:48.040,01:04:51.090
that we have defined.,01:04:51.090,01:04:52.780
"And so this is essentially the
change starting from E and x",01:04:52.780,01:05:05.860
"to going to the case where
x changed by an amount dx.",01:05:05.860,01:05:14.430
"But through this
process I did work,",01:05:14.430,01:05:17.730
"and so the amount of energy that
is inside the system increases",01:05:17.730,01:05:22.500
by an amount that is j delta x.,01:05:22.500,01:05:23.980
"So if all of these
quantities are infinitesimal,",01:05:28.250,01:05:33.610
"I have two arguments of S now
have changed infinitesimally,",01:05:33.610,01:05:38.540
"and I can make the corresponding
expansion in derivatives.",01:05:38.540,01:05:42.230
"There is a dS with respect
to dE at constant x.",01:05:42.230,01:05:48.190
"The corresponding change
in E is j delta x.",01:05:48.190,01:05:55.170
"But then there's also a
dS by dx at constant E",01:05:55.170,01:06:02.660
"with the same delta
x, so I factored out",01:06:02.660,01:06:05.370
"the delta x between
the two of them.",01:06:05.370,01:06:07.214
"Now, dS by dE at
constant x is related",01:06:11.070,01:06:15.840
"to the empirical
temperature, which we now",01:06:15.840,01:06:18.540
"set to be 1 over
T. Now, the claim",01:06:18.540,01:06:24.980
"is that if you have a situation
such as this, where you have",01:06:24.980,01:06:30.110
"a state that is sitting
in equilibrium--",01:06:30.110,01:06:32.170
"let's say a gas with a
piston-- then by definition",01:06:32.170,01:06:37.980
"of equilibrium, the system
does not spontaneously",01:06:37.980,01:06:41.900
change its volume.,01:06:41.900,01:06:43.360
"But it will change its volume
because the number of states",01:06:46.730,01:06:49.850
"that is availability to it
increases, or S increases.",01:06:49.850,01:06:56.120
"So in order to
make sure that you",01:06:56.120,01:06:58.920
"don't go to a state that is
more probable, because there are",01:06:58.920,01:07:02.210
"more possibilities, there
are more microstates,",01:07:02.210,01:07:04.940
"I better make sure that
this first derivative is 0.",01:07:04.940,01:07:09.160
"Otherwise, depending on
whether this is plus or minus,",01:07:09.160,01:07:12.620
"I could make a
corresponding change",01:07:12.620,01:07:14.590
"in delta x that would
increase delta S.",01:07:14.590,01:07:18.380
"So what happens
here if I require",01:07:18.380,01:07:21.250
"this to be 0 is that
I can identify now",01:07:21.250,01:07:25.460
"that the derivative of this
quantity dS by dx at constant E",01:07:25.460,01:07:32.690
"has to be minus j
over T. Currently,",01:07:32.690,01:07:43.170
"I have only these two
variables, and quite",01:07:43.170,01:07:46.500
"generically, I can say that dS
is dS by dE at constant x dE",01:07:46.500,01:07:54.040
plus dS by dx at constant E dx.,01:07:54.040,01:07:59.410
"And now I have identified
these two derivatives.",01:07:59.410,01:08:02.550
"dS by dE is 1 over T, so I have
dE over T. dS by dx is minus",01:08:02.550,01:08:10.420
"j over T, so I have
minus j dx over T.",01:08:10.420,01:08:16.960
"And I can rearrange this, and I
see that dE is T dS plus j dx.",01:08:16.960,01:08:28.295
"Now, the j dx I
recognize as before, it's",01:08:32.390,01:08:37.210
the mechanical work.,01:08:37.210,01:08:40.040
"So I have identified
that generically,",01:08:40.040,01:08:42.720
"when you make a transformation,
in addition to mechanical work,",01:08:42.720,01:08:47.340
"there's a component that
changes the energy that",01:08:47.340,01:08:52.040
"is the one that we can
identify with the heat.",01:08:52.040,01:08:55.370
Yes?,01:08:55.370,01:08:56.229
"AUDIENCE: Could you explain
why you set that S to 0?",01:08:56.229,01:09:00.540
"PROFESSOR: Why did
I set delta S to 0?",01:09:00.540,01:09:03.710
"So I have a box, and this
box has a certain volume,",01:09:03.710,01:09:09.979
"and there's a bunch
of particles here,",01:09:09.979,01:09:12.700
"but the piston that
is holding this",01:09:12.700,01:09:15.420
"is allowed to slide
to go up and down.",01:09:15.420,01:09:19.270
OK?,01:09:19.270,01:09:20.770
"Now, I can ask what happens if
the volume goes up and down.",01:09:20.770,01:09:26.620
"If the volume goes up and down,
how many states are available?",01:09:26.620,01:09:32.370
"So basically, the
statement has been",01:09:32.370,01:09:35.189
"that for each
configuration, there",01:09:35.189,01:09:38.729
"is a number of states
that is available.",01:09:38.729,01:09:42.460
"And if I were to change
that configuration,",01:09:42.460,01:09:45.649
"the number of
states will change.",01:09:45.649,01:09:47.630
"And hence the log of it, which
is the entropy, will change.",01:09:47.630,01:09:50.979
So how much does it change?,01:09:50.979,01:09:53.290
"Well, let's see what
arguments changed.",01:09:53.290,01:09:55.300
"So certainly, the
volume changed.",01:09:55.300,01:09:58.530
So x went to x plus dx.,01:09:58.530,01:10:01.970
"And because I did
some amount of work,",01:10:01.970,01:10:05.390
"pdv, the amount of energy that
was in the box also changed.",01:10:05.390,01:10:11.100
OK?,01:10:11.100,01:10:11.910
"So after this transformation
with this thing going",01:10:11.910,01:10:15.040
"up or down, what is
the new logarithm",01:10:15.040,01:10:19.600
of the number of states?,01:10:19.600,01:10:21.140
How much has it changed?,01:10:21.140,01:10:22.730
"And how much of the
change is given by this?",01:10:22.730,01:10:26.230
"Now, suppose that
I make this change,",01:10:26.230,01:10:28.570
"and I find that suddenly I
have a thousand more states",01:10:28.570,01:10:31.700
available to me.,01:10:31.700,01:10:32.850
"It's a thousand
times more likely",01:10:32.850,01:10:34.910
that I will accept this change.,01:10:34.910,01:10:37.540
"So in order for me to be
penalized-- or actually,",01:10:37.540,01:10:43.440
"not penalized, or
not gain-- because I",01:10:43.440,01:10:46.150
"make this transformation,
this change better be 0.",01:10:46.150,01:10:49.430
"If it is not 0, if
this quantity is,",01:10:51.970,01:10:55.840
"let's say, positive,
then I will choose",01:10:55.840,01:10:58.380
"a delta v that is positive, and
delta S will become positive.",01:10:58.380,01:11:03.510
"If this quantity
happens to be negative,",01:11:03.510,01:11:06.135
"then I will choose a
delta v that is negative,",01:11:06.135,01:11:08.710
"and then delta S will
be positive again.",01:11:08.710,01:11:11.880
"So the statement that
this thing originally",01:11:11.880,01:11:15.340
"was sitting there by
itself in equilibrium",01:11:15.340,01:11:19.460
"and did not spontaneously
go up or down",01:11:19.460,01:11:23.500
"is this statement
this derivative 0.",01:11:23.500,01:11:26.416
"AUDIENCE: That's only 0 when
the system is in equilibrium?",01:11:33.178,01:11:37.540
PROFESSOR: Yes.,01:11:37.540,01:11:38.290
Yes.,01:11:38.290,01:11:39.260
"So indeed, this is
then a relationship",01:11:39.260,01:11:46.000
"that involves parameters of
the system in equilibrium.",01:11:46.000,01:11:49.460
Yeah?,01:11:49.460,01:11:49.960
"So there is
thermodynamically, we",01:11:49.960,01:11:52.600
"said that once I specify
what my energy and volume",01:11:52.600,01:11:58.810
"and number of particles
are in equilibrium,",01:11:58.810,01:12:01.140
"there is a particular
S. And what",01:12:01.140,01:12:03.610
"I want to know is if
I go from one state",01:12:03.610,01:12:06.780
"to another state in equilibrium,
what is the change in dS?",01:12:06.780,01:12:11.550
That's what this statement is.,01:12:11.550,01:12:13.880
"Then I can rearrange
it and see that when",01:12:13.880,01:12:17.250
"I go from one equilibrium state
to another equilibrium state,",01:12:17.250,01:12:21.190
"I have to change
internal energy, which",01:12:21.190,01:12:23.560
"I can do either by doing
work or by doing heat.",01:12:23.560,01:12:28.992
OK?,01:12:33.948,01:12:34.448
"Now, the second law
is actually obvious.",01:12:54.290,01:12:56.110
"I have stated that I start
from this configuration",01:13:00.620,01:13:05.050
"and go to that configuration
simply because of probability.",01:13:05.050,01:13:09.810
"The probabilities are inverse
of this omega, if you like.",01:13:09.810,01:13:15.290
"So I start with some location--
like the pack of cards,",01:13:15.290,01:13:20.780
"all of the black
on one side, all",01:13:20.780,01:13:22.655
"of the red on the other
side-- and I do some dynamics,",01:13:22.655,01:13:27.920
"and I will end up
with some other state.",01:13:27.920,01:13:29.800
"I will, because why?",01:13:29.800,01:13:31.730
"Because that state has a much
more volume of possibilities.",01:13:31.730,01:13:36.990
"There is a single
state that we identify",01:13:36.990,01:13:38.880
"as all-black and
all-red, and there's",01:13:38.880,01:13:41.260
"a myriad of states that we say
they're all randomly mixed,",01:13:41.260,01:13:45.130
"and so we're much
more likely to find",01:13:45.130,01:13:47.120
from that subset of states.,01:13:47.120,01:13:50.780
"So I have certainly stated
that S1 evaluated at E1 star,",01:13:50.780,01:13:57.520
"plus S2 evaluated at
E2 star, essentially",01:13:57.520,01:14:02.480
"the peak of that object, is much
larger than S1 plus E1 plus 0",01:14:02.480,01:14:11.140
plus S2 [INAUDIBLE].,01:14:11.140,01:14:12.616
"And more specifically,
if we sort of follow",01:14:22.970,01:14:28.270
"the course of the system
as it starts from here,",01:14:28.270,01:14:34.790
"you will find that it will
basically go in the direction",01:14:34.790,01:14:39.120
"always such that the derivatives
that are related to temperature",01:14:39.120,01:14:46.490
"are such that the energy
will flow from the hot air",01:14:46.490,01:14:51.960
"to the colder body,
consistent with what",01:14:51.960,01:14:55.460
we expect from thermodynamics.,01:14:55.460,01:14:56.710
"The one law of thermodynamic
that I cannot prove from what I",01:15:01.140,01:15:04.920
"have given you so
far is the third law.",01:15:04.920,01:15:07.565
"There is no reason
why the entropy should",01:15:07.565,01:15:10.280
"go to 0 as you go
to 0 temperature",01:15:10.280,01:15:13.450
within this perspective.,01:15:13.450,01:15:14.519
"So it's good to look at our
canonical example, which",01:15:21.510,01:15:28.310
is the ideal gas.,01:15:28.310,01:15:29.560
"Again, for the
ideal gas, if I am",01:15:34.390,01:15:37.365
"in a microcanonical
ensemble, it means",01:15:37.365,01:15:39.740
"that I have told you what
the energy of the box is,",01:15:39.740,01:15:42.880
"what the volume of the box
is, and how many particles",01:15:42.880,01:15:45.250
are in it.,01:15:45.250,01:15:48.190
"So clearly the microstate
that corresponds to that",01:15:48.190,01:15:52.100
"is the collection of
the 6N coordinates",01:15:52.100,01:15:55.720
"and momenta of the
particles in the box.",01:15:55.720,01:16:00.540
"And the energy of
the system is made up",01:16:00.540,01:16:05.130
"by the sum of the energies
of all of the particles,",01:16:05.130,01:16:10.150
"and basically, ideal gas means
that the energy that we write",01:16:10.150,01:16:17.700
"is the sum of the
contributions that you",01:16:17.700,01:16:20.485
"would have from
individual particles.",01:16:20.485,01:16:23.540
"So individual particles
have a kinetic energy",01:16:23.540,01:16:26.960
"and some potential
energy, and since we",01:16:26.960,01:16:30.810
"are stating that we
have a box of volume v,",01:16:30.810,01:16:33.900
"this u essentially represents
this box of volume.",01:16:33.900,01:16:39.450
"It's a potential that is 0
inside this volume and infinity",01:16:39.450,01:16:43.450
outside of it.,01:16:43.450,01:16:44.321
Fine.,01:16:47.550,01:16:49.230
"So you ask what's
the probability",01:16:49.230,01:16:53.990
"of some particular
microstate, given",01:16:53.990,01:16:56.220
"that I specified E, v, and n.",01:16:56.220,01:16:59.790
"I would say, well, OK.",01:16:59.790,01:17:02.290
"This is, by the construction
that we had, 0 or 1",01:17:02.290,01:17:09.820
"over some omega, depending on
whether the energy is right.",01:17:09.820,01:17:16.910
"And since for the
box, the energy",01:17:16.910,01:17:18.910
"is made up of the
kinetic energy,",01:17:18.910,01:17:21.250
"if sum over i p i squared
over 2m is not equal to E,",01:17:21.250,01:17:32.910
"or particle q is
outside the box.",01:17:32.910,01:17:37.755
"And it is the same value if
sum over i p i squared over 2m",01:17:42.710,01:17:51.350
"is equal to v and q i's
are all inside the box.",01:17:51.350,01:17:56.490
So a note about normalization.,01:18:07.921,01:18:14.230
"I kind of skipped on
this over the last one.",01:18:14.230,01:18:17.690
"p is a probability in this
6N dimensional phase space.",01:18:17.690,01:18:23.400
"So the normalization is that the
integral over all of the p i's",01:18:23.400,01:18:32.820
and qi's should be equal to 1.,01:18:32.820,01:18:42.470
"And so this omega,
more precisely,",01:18:42.470,01:18:46.640
"when we are not talking
about discrete numbers,",01:18:46.640,01:18:49.920
"is the quantity
that I have to put",01:18:49.920,01:18:53.530
"so that when I integrate this
over phase space, I will get 1.",01:18:53.530,01:18:58.890
"So basically, if I write this
in the form that I have written,",01:18:58.890,01:19:03.940
"you can see that omega is
obtained by integrating over",01:19:03.940,01:19:11.830
"p i q i that correspond
to this accessible states.",01:19:11.830,01:19:18.850
"It's kind of like
a delta function.",01:19:25.290,01:19:27.670
"Basically, there's huge
portions of phase space",01:19:27.670,01:19:32.240
"that are 0 probability,
and then there's",01:19:32.240,01:19:38.060
"a surface that has
the probability that",01:19:38.060,01:19:43.990
"is 1 over omega and it is
the area of that surface",01:19:43.990,01:19:48.610
"that I have to ensure
is appearing here,",01:19:48.610,01:19:52.000
"so that when I integrate
over that area of one",01:19:52.000,01:19:54.730
"over that area, I will get one.",01:19:54.730,01:19:59.070
"Now, the part that corresponds
to the q coordinates",01:19:59.070,01:20:03.230
"is actually very
simple, because the q",01:20:03.230,01:20:06.190
"coordinates have to
be inside the box.",01:20:06.190,01:20:09.340
"Each one of them has a volume
v, so the coordinate part",01:20:09.340,01:20:12.820
"of the integral
gives me v to the m.",01:20:12.820,01:20:16.041
OK?,01:20:16.041,01:20:16.540
"Now, the momentum
part, the momenta",01:20:19.330,01:20:24.170
"are constrained by
something like this.",01:20:24.170,01:20:26.480
"I can rewrite that as sum over
i p i squared equals to 2mE.",01:20:30.640,01:20:38.040
"And if I regard this 2mE as
something like r squared,",01:20:41.500,01:20:47.290
"like a radius
squared, you can see",01:20:47.290,01:20:49.680
"that this is like
the equation that you",01:20:49.680,01:20:52.310
"would have for
the generalization",01:20:52.310,01:20:54.620
of the sphere in 3N dimensions.,01:20:54.620,01:20:57.600
"Because if I had
just x squared, x",01:20:57.600,01:21:00.090
"squared plus y squared
is r squared is a circle,",01:21:00.090,01:21:03.030
"x squared plus y
squared plus z squared",01:21:03.030,01:21:05.140
"is r squared is
a sphere, so this",01:21:05.140,01:21:07.700
"is the hypersphere
in 3N dimensions.",01:21:07.700,01:21:15.410
"So when I do the
integrations over q,",01:21:18.160,01:21:22.740
"I have to integrate
over the surface of a 3N",01:21:22.740,01:21:32.880
"dimensional hypersphere of
radius square root of 2m.",01:21:32.880,01:21:45.270
OK?,01:21:47.850,01:21:49.744
"And there is a simple
formula for that.",01:21:49.744,01:21:54.140
"This surface area,
in general, is",01:21:54.140,01:21:59.800
"going to be
proportional to r raised",01:21:59.800,01:22:03.460
"to the power of
dimension minus 1.",01:22:03.460,01:22:07.880
"And there's the generalization
of 2pi r over 4pi r squared",01:22:07.880,01:22:12.210
"that you would have in
two or three dimensions,",01:22:12.210,01:22:14.940
which we will discuss next time.,01:22:14.940,01:22:17.900
"It is 2 to the
power of 3n over 2",01:22:17.900,01:22:22.170
divided by 3n over 2 factorial.,01:22:22.170,01:22:26.980
"So we have the formula
for this omega.",01:22:26.980,01:22:29.950
"We will re-derive it and
discuss it next time.",01:22:29.950,01:22:34.150
