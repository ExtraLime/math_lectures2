"OK, here we go with, quiz
review for the third quiz that's",00:00:07.930,00:00:13.530
coming on Friday.,00:00:13.530,00:00:15.910
"So, one key point
is that the quiz",00:00:15.910,00:00:19.040
covers through chapter six.,00:00:19.040,00:00:25.120
"Chapter seven on
linear transformations",00:00:25.120,00:00:27.580
"will appear on the final
exam, but not on the quiz.",00:00:27.580,00:00:31.930
"So I won't review linear
transformations today,",00:00:31.930,00:00:35.540
"but they'll come into the
full course review on the very",00:00:35.540,00:00:39.720
last lecture.,00:00:39.720,00:00:41.350
"So today, I'm
reviewing chapter six,",00:00:41.350,00:00:44.120
"and I'm going to
take some old exams,",00:00:44.120,00:00:46.330
"and I'm always ready
to answer questions.",00:00:46.330,00:00:48.990
"And I thought, kind of help
our memories if I write down",00:00:48.990,00:00:54.360
the main topics in chapter six.,00:00:54.360,00:01:00.350
"So, already, on
the previous quiz,",00:01:00.350,00:01:04.019
"we knew how to find
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.",00:01:04.019,00:01:07.520
"Well, we knew how to find them
by that determinant of A minus",00:01:07.520,00:01:13.480
lambda I equals zero.,00:01:13.480,00:01:15.390
"But, of course, there
could be shortcuts.",00:01:15.390,00:01:17.280
"There could be, like,
useful information",00:01:17.280,00:01:20.030
"about the eigenvalues that
we can speed things up with.",00:01:20.030,00:01:27.190
OK.,00:01:27.190,00:01:27.830
"Then, the new stuff starts out
with a differential equation,",00:01:27.830,00:01:32.300
so I'll do a problem.,00:01:32.300,00:01:34.680
"I'll do a differential
equation problem first.",00:01:34.680,00:01:36.810
"What's special about
symmetric matrices?",00:01:39.970,00:01:43.010
Can we just say that in words?,00:01:43.010,00:01:46.060
"I'd better write
it down, though.",00:01:46.060,00:01:48.170
"What's special about
symmetric matrices?",00:01:48.170,00:01:50.960
Their eigenvalues are real.,00:01:50.960,00:01:56.970
"The eigenvalues of a symmetric
matrix always come out real,",00:01:56.970,00:02:00.970
"and there always are
enough eigenvectors.",00:02:00.970,00:02:04.800
"Even if there are
repeated eigenvalues,",00:02:04.800,00:02:06.930
"there are enough
eigenvectors, and we",00:02:06.930,00:02:09.910
"can choose those eigenvectors
to be orthogonal.",00:02:09.910,00:02:13.180
"So if A equals A
transposed, the big fact",00:02:13.180,00:02:16.480
"will be that we
can diagonalize it,",00:02:16.480,00:02:22.620
"and those eigenvector
matrix, with the eigenvectors",00:02:22.620,00:02:28.550
"in the column, can be
an orthogonal matrix.",00:02:28.550,00:02:31.470
"So we get a Q
lambda Q transpose.",00:02:31.470,00:02:36.600
"That, in three symbols,
expresses a wonderful fact,",00:02:36.600,00:02:43.010
"a fundamental fact for
symmetric matrices.",00:02:43.010,00:02:46.250
OK.,00:02:46.250,00:02:46.960
"Then, we went beyond
that fact to ask",00:02:46.960,00:02:49.740
"about positive
definite matrices, when",00:02:49.740,00:02:52.570
the eigenvalues were positive.,00:02:52.570,00:02:54.370
I'll do an example of that.,00:02:54.370,00:02:55.970
Now we've left symmetry.,00:02:59.290,00:03:01.580
"Similar matrices are
any square matrices,",00:03:01.580,00:03:05.000
"but two matrices are similar
if they're related that way.",00:03:05.000,00:03:10.730
"And what's the key point
about similar matrices?",00:03:10.730,00:03:14.590
"Somehow, those matrices
are representing",00:03:14.590,00:03:16.770
"the same thing in
different basis,",00:03:16.770,00:03:19.410
in chapter seven language.,00:03:19.410,00:03:21.980
"In chapter six language, what's
up with these similar matrices?",00:03:21.980,00:03:29.220
"What's the key fact,
the key positive fact",00:03:29.220,00:03:31.860
about similar matrices?,00:03:31.860,00:03:33.570
They have the same eigenvalues.,00:03:33.570,00:03:37.130
Same eigenvalues.,00:03:37.130,00:03:39.070
"So if one of them grows,
the other one grows.",00:03:39.070,00:03:42.460
"If one of them decays to zero,
the other one decays to zero.",00:03:42.460,00:03:50.380
"Powers of A will look
like powers of B,",00:03:50.380,00:03:53.050
"because powers of
A and powers of B",00:03:53.050,00:03:55.440
"only differ by an M
inverse and an M way on the",00:03:55.440,00:03:59.160
outside.,00:03:59.160,00:04:00.040
"So if these are similar,
then B to the k-th power",00:04:00.040,00:04:05.250
"is M inverse A to
the k-th power M.",00:04:05.250,00:04:09.160
"And that's why I
say, eh, this M, it",00:04:09.160,00:04:12.410
"does change the
eigenvectors, but it",00:04:12.410,00:04:14.480
doesn't change the eigenvalues.,00:04:14.480,00:04:16.089
So same lambdas.,00:04:16.089,00:04:21.209
"And then, finally, I've
got to review the point",00:04:21.209,00:04:24.510
"about the SVD, the Singular
Value Decomposition.",00:04:24.510,00:04:30.000
OK.,00:04:30.000,00:04:30.500
"So that's what this
quiz has got to cover,",00:04:30.500,00:04:33.900
"and now I'll just take
problems from earlier exams,",00:04:33.900,00:04:37.720
"starting with a
differential equation.",00:04:37.720,00:04:40.460
OK.,00:04:40.460,00:04:41.250
And always ready for questions.,00:04:41.250,00:04:43.360
"So here is an exam
from about the year",00:04:43.360,00:04:46.640
"zero, and it has
a three by three.",00:04:46.640,00:04:53.290
So that was --,00:04:53.290,00:04:54.502
"but it's a pretty
special-looking matrix,",00:04:57.280,00:04:59.720
"it's got zeroes on the diagonal,
it's got minus ones above,",00:04:59.720,00:05:04.190
"and it's got plus
ones like that.",00:05:04.190,00:05:08.360
So that's the matrix A.,00:05:08.360,00:05:12.160
OK.,00:05:12.160,00:05:12.880
"Step one is, well,
I want to solve that",00:05:12.880,00:05:16.750
equation.,00:05:16.750,00:05:17.700
"I want to find the
general solution.",00:05:17.700,00:05:19.970
"I haven't given you
a u(0) here, so I'm",00:05:19.970,00:05:22.790
"looking for the
general solution,",00:05:22.790,00:05:24.900
"so now what's the form
of the general solution?",00:05:24.900,00:05:28.280
"With three arbitrary
constants going",00:05:28.280,00:05:30.520
"to be inside it, because
those will be used",00:05:30.520,00:05:33.940
to match the initial condition.,00:05:33.940,00:05:35.780
"So the general
form is u at time t",00:05:35.780,00:05:39.580
"is some multiple of the
first special solution.",00:05:39.580,00:05:45.500
"The first special solution will
be growing like the eigenvalue,",00:05:45.500,00:05:50.080
and it's the eigenvector.,00:05:50.080,00:05:51.920
"So that's a pure exponential
solution, just staying",00:05:51.920,00:05:56.400
with that eigenvector.,00:05:56.400,00:05:58.580
"Of course, I haven't
found, yet, the eigenvalues",00:05:58.580,00:06:01.770
and eigenvectors.,00:06:01.770,00:06:02.580
"That's, normally, the first job.",00:06:02.580,00:06:04.900
"Now, there will be second
one, growing like e",00:06:04.900,00:06:08.880
"to the lambda two, and a
third one growing like e",00:06:08.880,00:06:13.160
to the lambda three.,00:06:13.160,00:06:16.450
So we're all done --,00:06:16.450,00:06:18.880
"well, we haven't
done anything yet,",00:06:18.880,00:06:20.860
actually.,00:06:20.860,00:06:22.100
"I've got to find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors,",00:06:22.100,00:06:25.930
"and then I would match u(0)
by choosing the right three",00:06:25.930,00:06:30.720
constants.,00:06:30.720,00:06:31.420
OK.,00:06:31.420,00:06:31.950
"So now I ask -- ask you
about the eigenvalues",00:06:31.950,00:06:35.030
"and eigenvectors, and you look
at this matrix and what do you",00:06:35.030,00:06:38.790
see in that matrix?,00:06:38.790,00:06:41.390
"Um, well, I guess we might
ask ourselves right away,",00:06:41.390,00:06:47.740
is it singular?,00:06:47.740,00:06:50.760
Is it singular?,00:06:50.760,00:06:51.810
"Because, if so, then we
really have a head start,",00:06:51.810,00:06:54.040
"we know one of the
eigenvalues is zero.",00:06:54.040,00:06:56.810
Is that matrix singular?,00:06:56.810,00:06:57.990
"Eh, I don't know, do you
take the determinant to",00:07:01.660,00:07:04.280
find out?,00:07:04.280,00:07:05.110
"Or maybe you look at the
first row and third row",00:07:05.110,00:07:08.530
"and say, hey, the
first row and third row",00:07:08.530,00:07:10.270
"are just opposite signs,
they're linear-dependent?",00:07:10.270,00:07:15.180
"The first column and third
column are dependent -- it's",00:07:15.180,00:07:17.930
singular.,00:07:17.930,00:07:19.150
So one eigenvalue is zero.,00:07:19.150,00:07:22.610
Let's make that lambda one.,00:07:22.610,00:07:24.520
"Lambda one, then, will be zero.",00:07:24.520,00:07:26.150
OK.,00:07:26.150,00:07:26.850
"Now we've got a couple of
other eigenvalues to find,",00:07:26.850,00:07:30.000
"and, I suppose the
simplest way is",00:07:30.000,00:07:33.430
"to look at A minus
lambda I So let",00:07:33.430,00:07:36.940
"me just put minus lambda
in here, minus ones above,",00:07:36.940,00:07:43.720
ones below.,00:07:43.720,00:07:45.520
"But, actually, before
I do it, that matrix",00:07:45.520,00:07:51.430
"is not symmetric,
for sure, right?",00:07:51.430,00:07:53.910
"In fact, it's the very
opposite of symmetric.",00:07:53.910,00:07:57.220
"That matrix A transpose, how
is A transpose connected to A?",00:07:57.220,00:08:02.420
It's negative A.,00:08:02.420,00:08:04.020
"It's an anti-symmetric
matrix, skew-symmetric matrix.",00:08:04.020,00:08:07.890
"And we've met, maybe,
a two-by-two example",00:08:07.890,00:08:11.230
"of skew-symmetric
matrices, and let",00:08:11.230,00:08:14.370
"me just say, what's the
deal with their eigenvalues?",00:08:14.370,00:08:17.687
They're pure imaginary.,00:08:17.687,00:08:18.645
"They'll be on the
imaginary axis,",00:08:21.400,00:08:23.440
"there be some
multiple of I if it's",00:08:23.440,00:08:26.710
"an anti-symmetric,
skew-symmetric matrix.",00:08:26.710,00:08:29.090
"So I'm looking for
multiples of I,",00:08:29.090,00:08:31.360
"and of course,
that's zero times I,",00:08:31.360,00:08:33.730
"that's on the imaginary axis,
but maybe I just do it out,",00:08:33.730,00:08:37.760
here.,00:08:37.760,00:08:38.350
Lambda cubed.,00:08:38.350,00:08:39.740
"well, maybe that's
minus lambda cubed,",00:08:39.740,00:08:42.600
and then a zero and a zero.,00:08:42.600,00:08:44.480
"Zero, and then maybe I
have a plus a lambda,",00:08:44.480,00:08:47.870
"and another plus lambda, but
those go with a minus sign.",00:08:47.870,00:08:52.610
"Am I getting minus two
lambda equals zero?",00:08:52.610,00:08:55.080
So.,00:08:58.640,00:08:59.940
"So I'm solving lambda cube
plus two lambda equals zero.",00:08:59.940,00:09:04.810
"So one root factors out
lambda, and the the rest",00:09:04.810,00:09:09.070
is lambda squared plus two.,00:09:09.070,00:09:11.571
OK.,00:09:11.571,00:09:12.070
"This is going the
way we expect, right?",00:09:12.070,00:09:14.310
"Because this gives the root
lambda equals zero, and gives",00:09:14.310,00:09:22.360
"the other two roots, which
are lambda equal what?",00:09:22.360,00:09:27.630
"The solutions of when
is lambda squared",00:09:27.630,00:09:30.200
"plus two equals zero then the
eigenvalues those guys, what",00:09:30.200,00:09:36.510
are they?,00:09:36.510,00:09:38.610
"They're a multiple of i,
they're just square root of two",00:09:38.610,00:09:41.260
i.,00:09:41.260,00:09:42.150
"When I set this
equals to zero, I",00:09:42.150,00:09:45.010
"have lambda squared equal
to minus two, right?",00:09:45.010,00:09:48.800
To make that zero?,00:09:48.800,00:09:50.710
"And the roots are
square root of two i",00:09:50.710,00:09:54.180
"and minus the square
root of two i.",00:09:54.180,00:09:58.060
So now I know what those are.,00:09:58.060,00:09:59.540
"I'll put those in, now.",00:09:59.540,00:10:01.070
Either the zero t is just a one.,00:10:01.070,00:10:03.840
That's just a one.,00:10:03.840,00:10:06.840
"This is square root of
two I and this is minus",00:10:06.840,00:10:13.700
square root of two I.,00:10:13.700,00:10:18.280
"So, is the solution
decaying to zero?",00:10:18.280,00:10:22.590
"Is this a completely
stable problem",00:10:22.590,00:10:25.210
"where the solution
is going to zero?",00:10:25.210,00:10:28.630
No.,00:10:28.630,00:10:31.200
"In fact, all these things
are staying the same size.",00:10:31.200,00:10:34.620
"This thing is getting
multiplied by this number.",00:10:34.620,00:10:39.290
"e to the I something t, that's
a number that has magnitude one,",00:10:39.290,00:10:46.880
"and sort of wanders
around the unit circle.",00:10:46.880,00:10:50.160
Same for this.,00:10:50.160,00:10:51.660
"So that the solution doesn't
blow up, and it doesn't go to",00:10:51.660,00:10:55.900
zero.,00:10:55.900,00:10:56.520
OK.,00:10:56.520,00:10:57.410
"And to find out
what it actually is,",00:10:57.410,00:10:59.670
"we would have to plug
in initial conditions.",00:10:59.670,00:11:02.370
"But actually, the
next question I ask",00:11:02.370,00:11:04.410
"is, when does the solution
return to its initial value?",00:11:04.410,00:11:12.280
"I won't even say what's
the initial value.",00:11:12.280,00:11:15.910
"This is a case in which
I think this solution is",00:11:15.910,00:11:22.540
periodic after.,00:11:22.540,00:11:25.350
"At t equals zero, it
starts with c1, c2, and c3,",00:11:25.350,00:11:31.820
"and then at some value of
t, it comes back to that.",00:11:31.820,00:11:36.500
"So that's a very
special question,",00:11:36.500,00:11:38.440
"Well, let's just
take three seconds,",00:11:38.440,00:11:40.280
"because that special question
isn't likely to be on the quiz.",00:11:40.280,00:11:44.040
"But it comes back
to the start, when?",00:11:44.040,00:11:49.910
"Well, whenever we have e to
the two pi i, that's one,",00:11:49.910,00:11:55.230
and we've come back again.,00:11:55.230,00:11:56.450
So it comes back to the start.,00:11:56.450,00:11:58.700
"It's periodic, when this
square root of two i --",00:11:58.700,00:12:07.740
"shall I call it capital
T, for the period?",00:12:07.740,00:12:10.930
"For that particular T, if
that equals two pi i, then e",00:12:10.930,00:12:17.270
"to this thing is one, and
we've come around again.",00:12:17.270,00:12:21.090
"So the period is T is
determined here, cancel the i-s,",00:12:21.090,00:12:26.250
"and T is pi times the
square root of two.",00:12:26.250,00:12:30.970
So that's pretty neat.,00:12:30.970,00:12:32.270
"We get all the information
about all solutions,",00:12:32.270,00:12:35.610
"we haven't fixed on only
one particular solution,",00:12:35.610,00:12:39.230
but it comes around again.,00:12:39.230,00:12:41.450
"So this was probably
my first chance",00:12:41.450,00:12:43.730
"to say something
about the whole family",00:12:43.730,00:12:46.270
"of anti-symmetric,
skew-symmetric matrices.",00:12:46.270,00:12:49.760
OK.,00:12:49.760,00:12:50.380
"And then, finally, I asked,
take two eigenvectors (again,",00:12:50.380,00:12:56.880
"I haven't computed
the eigenvectors)",00:12:56.880,00:12:59.450
"and it turns out
they're orthogonal.",00:12:59.450,00:13:02.690
They're orthogonal.,00:13:02.690,00:13:03.500
"The eigenvectors of
a symmetric matrix,",00:13:03.500,00:13:06.500
"or a skew-symmetric matrix,
are always orthogonal.",00:13:06.500,00:13:10.250
"I guess may conscience
makes me tell you,",00:13:13.200,00:13:18.020
"what are all the matrices that
have orthogonal eigenvectors?",00:13:18.020,00:13:23.950
"And symmetric is the
most important class,",00:13:23.950,00:13:27.040
"so that's the one
we've spoken about.",00:13:27.040,00:13:28.640
"But let me just put that
little fact down, here.",00:13:28.640,00:13:32.800
Orthogonal x-s.,00:13:32.800,00:13:36.661
eigenvectors.,00:13:36.661,00:13:37.202
"A matrix has orthogonal
eigenvectors,",00:13:41.430,00:13:44.200
"the exact condition -- it's
quite beautiful that I can tell",00:13:44.200,00:13:47.430
you exactly when that happens.,00:13:47.430,00:13:49.340
"It happens when A times A
transpose equals A transpose",00:13:49.340,00:13:55.290
"times A. Any time
that's the condition",00:13:55.290,00:14:00.290
for orthogonal eigenvectors.,00:14:00.290,00:14:03.700
"And because we're interested
in special families of vectors,",00:14:03.700,00:14:09.040
"tell me some special
families that fit.",00:14:09.040,00:14:12.690
This is the whole requirement.,00:14:12.690,00:14:15.410
"That's a pretty special
requirement most matrices have.",00:14:15.410,00:14:21.120
"So the average
three-by-three matrix",00:14:21.120,00:14:23.070
"has three eigenvectors,
but not orthogonal.",00:14:23.070,00:14:26.240
"But if it happens to
commute with its transpose,",00:14:26.240,00:14:29.380
"then, wonderfully, the
eigenvectors are orthogonal.",00:14:29.380,00:14:34.010
"Now, do you see how symmetric
matrices pass this test?",00:14:34.010,00:14:39.250
Of course.,00:14:39.250,00:14:40.340
"If A transpose equals A, then
both sides are A squared,",00:14:40.340,00:14:43.790
we've got it.,00:14:43.790,00:14:45.640
"How do anti-symmetric
matrices pass this test?",00:14:45.640,00:14:49.410
"If A transpose equals
minus A, then we've",00:14:49.410,00:14:54.060
"got it again, because we've got
minus A squared on both sides.",00:14:54.060,00:14:58.220
So that's another group.,00:14:58.220,00:15:00.050
"And finally, let me ask you
about our other favorite",00:15:00.050,00:15:03.090
"family, orthogonal matrices.",00:15:03.090,00:15:06.950
"Do orthogonal matrices pass
this test, if A is a Q,",00:15:06.950,00:15:11.730
"do they pass the test for
orthogonal eigenvectors.",00:15:11.730,00:15:14.990
"Well, if A is Q, an orthogonal
matrix, what is Q transpose Q?",00:15:14.990,00:15:22.320
It's I.,00:15:22.320,00:15:23.020
And what is Q Q transpose?,00:15:23.020,00:15:25.310
"It's I, we're talking
square matrices here.",00:15:25.310,00:15:28.010
"So yes, it passes the test.",00:15:28.010,00:15:30.100
"So the special cases are
symmetric, anti-symmetric",00:15:30.100,00:15:36.600
"(I'll say skew-symmetric,)
and orthogonal.",00:15:36.600,00:15:41.080
"Those are the three
important special classes",00:15:41.080,00:15:44.280
that are in this family.,00:15:44.280,00:15:45.710
OK.,00:15:45.710,00:15:46.210
"That's like a comment that,
could have been made back in,",00:15:46.210,00:15:52.860
section six point four.,00:15:52.860,00:15:54.870
"OK, I can pursue the
differential equations, also",00:15:54.870,00:16:04.390
"this question, didn't
ask you to tell me,",00:16:04.390,00:16:09.090
"how would I find this matrix
exponential, e to the At?",00:16:09.090,00:16:13.920
So can I erase this?,00:16:13.920,00:16:15.050
I'll just stay with this same...,00:16:15.050,00:16:17.050
how would I find e to the At?,00:16:19.690,00:16:23.770
"Because, how does that come in?",00:16:23.770,00:16:27.010
"That's the key matrix for
a differential equation,",00:16:27.010,00:16:30.140
because the solution is --,00:16:30.140,00:16:32.460
"the solution is
u(t) is e^(At) u(0).",00:16:32.460,00:16:38.520
"So this is like the
fundamental matrix",00:16:38.520,00:16:42.060
"that multiplies the given
function and gives the answer.",00:16:42.060,00:16:48.400
"And how would we compute
it if we wanted that?",00:16:48.400,00:16:53.630
"We don't always have to
find e to the At, because I",00:16:53.630,00:16:56.830
"can go directly to the answer
without any e to the At-s,",00:16:56.830,00:17:00.500
"but hiding here is an e to the
At, and how would I compute it?",00:17:00.500,00:17:06.440
"Well, if A is diagonalizable.",00:17:06.440,00:17:10.026
"So I'm now going to put in my
usual if A can be diagonalized",00:17:12.589,00:17:21.510
"(and everybody remember
that there is an if there,",00:17:21.510,00:17:25.240
"because it might not
have enough eigenvectors)",00:17:25.240,00:17:28.820
"this example does have enough,
random matrices have enough.",00:17:28.820,00:17:33.330
"So if we can diagonalize, then
we get a nice formula for this,",00:17:33.330,00:17:36.720
"because an S comes way
out at the beginning,",00:17:36.720,00:17:40.050
"and S inverse comes
way out at the end,",00:17:40.050,00:17:42.740
"and we only have to take
the exponential of lambda.",00:17:42.740,00:17:47.450
"And that's just a
diagonal matrix,",00:17:47.450,00:17:49.980
"so that's just e
the lambda one t,",00:17:49.980,00:17:53.780

now, in e to the lambda nt.",00:17:53.780,00:18:00.030

review of that formula.",00:18:01.070,00:18:03.510

compute it quickly",00:18:06.040,00:18:08.780

S and lambda part.",00:18:08.780,00:18:11.250

lambda, then it's",00:18:13.770,00:18:15.470
not hard to take that step.,00:18:15.470,00:18:17.440
"OK, that's some comments
on differential equations.",00:18:17.440,00:18:20.770
"I would like to go on to a next
question that I started here.",00:18:20.770,00:18:28.330
"And it's, got several parts,
and I can just read it out.",00:18:28.330,00:18:33.410
"What we're given is a
three-by-three matrix,",00:18:33.410,00:18:37.320
"and we're told its eigenvalues,
except one of these",00:18:37.320,00:18:41.900
"is, like, we don't know, and
we're told the eigenvectors.",00:18:41.900,00:18:47.700
"And I want to ask
you about the matrix.",00:18:47.700,00:18:50.500
OK.,00:18:50.500,00:18:51.190
"So, first question.",00:18:51.190,00:18:54.530
Is the matrix diagonalizable?,00:18:54.530,00:18:56.430
"And I really mean for
which c, because I",00:18:59.000,00:19:03.030
"don't know c, so my
questions will all be,",00:19:03.030,00:19:06.850
"for which is there a condition
on c, does one c work.",00:19:06.850,00:19:12.340
"But your answer should tell
me all the c-s that work.",00:19:12.340,00:19:17.270
"I'm not asking for you to
tell me, well, c equal four,",00:19:17.270,00:19:21.390
"yes, that checks out.",00:19:21.390,00:19:22.660
"I want to know all the c-s
that make it diagonalizable.",00:19:22.660,00:19:27.927
OK?,00:19:34.950,00:19:36.640
"What's the real
on diagonalizable?",00:19:36.640,00:19:39.440
"We need enough
eigenvectors, right?",00:19:39.440,00:19:42.212
"We don't care what
those eigenvalues are,",00:19:42.212,00:19:43.920
"it's eigenvectors that
count for diagonalizable,",00:19:43.920,00:19:46.710
"and we need three
independent ones,",00:19:46.710,00:19:49.220
"and are those three
guys independent?",00:19:49.220,00:19:52.340
Yes.,00:19:52.340,00:19:53.580
"Actually, let's look
at them for a moment.",00:19:53.580,00:19:56.300
"What do you see about those
three vectors right away?",00:19:56.300,00:19:59.921
They're more than independent.,00:19:59.921,00:20:01.170
"Can you see why those
three got chosen?",00:20:04.380,00:20:09.730
"Because it will come up in the
next part, they're orthogonal.",00:20:09.730,00:20:15.780
"Those eigenvectors
are orthogonal.",00:20:15.780,00:20:17.920
They're certainly independent.,00:20:17.920,00:20:19.710
"So the answer to diagonalizable
is, yes, all c, all c.",00:20:19.710,00:20:28.220
"Doesn't matter. c could
be a repeated guy,",00:20:28.220,00:20:30.760
"but we've got
enough eigenvectors,",00:20:30.760,00:20:32.360
so that's what we care about.,00:20:32.360,00:20:33.930
"OK, second question.",00:20:33.930,00:20:36.400
"For which values of
c is it symmetric?",00:20:36.400,00:20:38.365
"OK, what's the
answer to that one?",00:20:40.960,00:20:46.000
"If we know the same setup if
we know that much about it,",00:20:48.650,00:20:53.420
"we know those
eigenvectors, and we've",00:20:53.420,00:20:55.330
"noticed they're orthogonal,
then which c-s will work?",00:20:55.330,00:21:02.850
"So the eigenvalues of that
symmetric matrix have to be",00:21:02.850,00:21:07.800
real.,00:21:07.800,00:21:08.490
So all real c.,00:21:08.490,00:21:11.780
"If c was i, the matrix
wouldn't have been symmetric.",00:21:11.780,00:21:17.300
"But if c is a real number, then
we've got real eigenvalues,",00:21:17.300,00:21:24.040
"we've got orthogonal
eigenvectors,",00:21:24.040,00:21:25.920
that matrix is symmetric.,00:21:25.920,00:21:27.400
"OK, positive definite.",00:21:27.400,00:21:28.790
"OK, now this is a
sub-case of symmetric,",00:21:28.790,00:21:40.630
"so we need c to be real, so
we've got a symmetric matrix,",00:21:40.630,00:21:45.900
"but we also want the thing
to be positive definite.",00:21:45.900,00:21:50.360
"Now, we're looking
at eigenvalues,",00:21:50.360,00:21:52.340
"we've got a lot of tests
for positive definite,",00:21:52.340,00:21:54.740
"but eigenvalues,
if we know them,",00:21:54.740,00:21:57.250
"is certainly a good,
quick, clean test.",00:21:57.250,00:22:01.100
"Could this matrix be
positive definite?",00:22:01.100,00:22:05.570
No.,00:22:05.570,00:22:06.640
"No, because it's got
an eigenvalue zero.",00:22:06.640,00:22:10.180
"It could be positive
semi-definite,",00:22:10.180,00:22:12.640
"you know, like
consolation prize,",00:22:12.640,00:22:15.900
"if c was greater
or equal to zero,",00:22:15.900,00:22:19.320
"it would be positive
semi-definite.",00:22:19.320,00:22:21.680
"But it's not, no.",00:22:21.680,00:22:25.520
"Semi-definite, if I put that
comment in, semi-definite,",00:22:25.520,00:22:30.670
"that the condition would be
c greater or equal to zero.",00:22:30.670,00:22:35.010
That would be all right.,00:22:35.010,00:22:36.300
OK.,00:22:36.300,00:22:37.220
Next part.,00:22:37.220,00:22:38.330
Is it a Markov matrix?,00:22:38.330,00:22:39.675
Hm.,00:22:44.260,00:22:44.870
"Could this matrix be, if I
choose the number c correctly,",00:22:44.870,00:22:50.440
a Markov matrix?,00:22:50.440,00:22:52.040
"Well, what do we know
about Markov matrices?",00:22:58.750,00:23:02.700
"Mainly, we know something
about their eigenvalues.",00:23:02.700,00:23:05.320
"One eigenvalue is always one,
and the other eigenvalues",00:23:05.320,00:23:10.500
are smaller.,00:23:10.500,00:23:13.430
Not larger.,00:23:13.430,00:23:14.690
"So an eigenvalue
two can't happen.",00:23:14.690,00:23:17.380
"So the answer is, no, not a ma-
that's never a Markov matrix.",00:23:17.380,00:23:22.000
OK?,00:23:22.000,00:23:22.750
"And finally, could one half
of A be a projection matrix?",00:23:22.750,00:23:29.970
"So could it- could this --
eh-eh could this be twice",00:23:29.970,00:23:32.820
a projection matrix?,00:23:32.820,00:23:33.890
So let me write it this way.,00:23:33.890,00:23:35.840
"Could A over two be
a projection matrix?",00:23:35.840,00:23:39.530
"OK, what are
projection matrices?",00:23:44.820,00:23:46.820
They're real.,00:23:46.820,00:23:48.650
"I mean, th- they're symmetric,
so their eigenvalues are real.",00:23:48.650,00:23:53.160
"But more than that, we know what
those eigenvalues have to be.",00:23:53.160,00:23:56.680
"What do the eigenvalues of a
projection matrix have to be?",00:23:56.680,00:24:01.150
"See, that any nice
matrix we've got",00:24:01.150,00:24:05.670
an idea about its eigenvalues.,00:24:05.670,00:24:08.490
"So the eigenvalues of
projection matrices are zero and",00:24:08.490,00:24:12.980
one.,00:24:12.980,00:24:13.970
"Zero and one, only.",00:24:13.970,00:24:16.710
"Because P squared equals P,
let me call this matrix P,",00:24:16.710,00:24:21.510
"so P squared equals P, so
lambda squared equals lambda,",00:24:21.510,00:24:26.510
"because eigenvalues of P
squared are lambda squared,",00:24:26.510,00:24:30.570
"and we must have that, so
lambda equals zero or one.",00:24:30.570,00:24:37.520
OK.,00:24:37.520,00:24:38.140
"Now what value of
c will work there?",00:24:38.140,00:24:42.060
"So, then, there are some
value that will work,",00:24:42.060,00:24:48.250
and what will work?,00:24:48.250,00:24:50.300
"c equals zero will work,
or what else will work?",00:24:50.300,00:24:56.340
c equal to two.,00:24:59.310,00:25:02.690
"Because if c is two, then
when we divide by two,",00:25:02.690,00:25:06.260
"this Eigenvalue of
two will drop to one,",00:25:06.260,00:25:09.880
"and so will the other one,
so, or c equal to two.",00:25:09.880,00:25:13.110
"OK, those are the
guys that will work,",00:25:13.110,00:25:15.640
"and it was the fact that those
eigenvectors were orthogonal,",00:25:15.640,00:25:21.110
"the fact that those
eigenvectors were orthogonal",00:25:21.110,00:25:23.780
"carried us a lot
of the way, here.",00:25:23.780,00:25:26.170
"If they weren't orthogonal, then
symmetric would have been dead,",00:25:26.170,00:25:29.400
"positive definite
would have been dead,",00:25:29.400,00:25:31.420
projection would have been dead.,00:25:31.420,00:25:33.150
"But those eigenvectors
were orthogonal,",00:25:33.150,00:25:37.090
"so it came down to
the eigenvalues.",00:25:37.090,00:25:40.180
"OK, that was like a chance to
review a lot of this chapter.",00:25:40.180,00:25:45.270
"Shall I jump to the singular
value decomposition,",00:25:50.790,00:25:56.030
"then, as the third, topic
for, for the review?",00:25:56.030,00:26:04.140
"OK, so I'm going
to. jump to this.",00:26:04.140,00:26:06.080
OK.,00:26:06.080,00:26:06.580
"So this is the singular
value decomposition,",00:26:13.950,00:26:16.990
known to everybody as the SVD.,00:26:16.990,00:26:21.070
"And that's a factorization
of A into orthogonal times",00:26:21.070,00:26:27.720
diagonal times orthogonal.,00:26:27.720,00:26:33.830
"And we always call those U
and sigma and V transpose.",00:26:33.830,00:26:41.030
OK.,00:26:41.030,00:26:42.300
And the key to that --,00:26:42.300,00:26:46.660
"this is for every
matrix, every A, every A.",00:26:46.660,00:26:51.170
"Rectangular, doesn't
matter, whatever,",00:26:51.170,00:26:54.110
has this decomposition.,00:26:54.110,00:26:56.740
So it's really important.,00:26:56.740,00:26:59.070
"And the key to it is to look
at things like A transpose A.",00:26:59.070,00:27:04.930
"Can we remember what
happens with A transpose A?",00:27:04.930,00:27:07.360
"If I just transpose that
I get V sigma transpose U",00:27:07.360,00:27:11.300
"transpose, that's
multiplying A, which is U,",00:27:11.300,00:27:15.420
"sigma V transpose, and the
result is V on the outside,",00:27:15.420,00:27:24.850
"s- U transpose U
is the identity,",00:27:24.850,00:27:27.990
"because it's an
orthogonal matrix.",00:27:27.990,00:27:30.930
"So I'm just left with
sigma transpose sigma",00:27:30.930,00:27:34.550
"in the middle, that's
a diagonal, possibly",00:27:34.550,00:27:39.340
"rectangular diagonal by its
transpose, so the result,",00:27:39.340,00:27:42.960
"this is orthogonal,
diagonal, orthogonal.",00:27:42.960,00:27:46.036
"So, I guess, actually, this
is the SVD for A transpose A.",00:27:49.840,00:27:55.620
"Here I see orthogonal,
diagonal, and orthogonal.",00:27:55.620,00:27:59.930
Great.,00:27:59.930,00:28:00.440
But a little more is happening.,00:28:00.440,00:28:07.000
"For A transpose
A, the difference",00:28:07.000,00:28:09.580
"is, the orthogonal
guys are the same.",00:28:09.580,00:28:13.690
It's V and V transpose.,00:28:13.690,00:28:15.640
What I seeing here?,00:28:15.640,00:28:17.290
"I'm seeing the factorization
for a symmetric matrix.",00:28:17.290,00:28:21.950
This thing is symmetric.,00:28:21.950,00:28:23.220
"So in a symmetric case,
U is the same as V.",00:28:26.790,00:28:30.590
"U is the same as V for
this symmetric matrix,",00:28:30.590,00:28:33.210
"and, of course, we
see it happening.",00:28:33.210,00:28:34.990
OK.,00:28:34.990,00:28:35.540
"So that tells us,
right away, what V is.",00:28:35.540,00:28:39.760
"V is the eigenvector
matrix for A transpose A.",00:28:39.760,00:28:49.650
OK.,00:28:49.650,00:28:50.490
"Now, if you were here when I
lectured about this topic, when",00:28:50.490,00:28:57.070
"I gave the topic on singular
value decompositions,",00:28:57.070,00:29:00.600
"you'll remember that
I got into trouble.",00:29:00.600,00:29:03.180
"I'm sorry to remember that
myself, but it happened.",00:29:06.150,00:29:09.860
OK.,00:29:09.860,00:29:10.550
How did it happen?,00:29:10.550,00:29:13.680
"I was in great shape for
a while, cruising along.",00:29:13.680,00:29:16.900
"So I found the eigenvectors
for A transpose A.",00:29:16.900,00:29:20.120
Good.,00:29:20.120,00:29:21.870
"I found the singular
values, what were they?",00:29:21.870,00:29:24.800
What were the singular values?,00:29:24.800,00:29:26.520
"The singular value
number i, or --",00:29:26.520,00:29:32.720
these are the guys in sigma --,00:29:32.720,00:29:36.890
"this is diagonal with
the number sigma in it.",00:29:36.890,00:29:39.770
"This diagonal is
sigma one, sigma two,",00:29:39.770,00:29:42.910
"up to the rank, sigma r,
those are the non-zero ones.",00:29:42.910,00:29:46.090
"So I found those,
and what are they?",00:29:48.830,00:29:51.100
Remind me about that?,00:29:51.100,00:29:53.130
"Well, here, I'm seeing them
squared, so their squares are",00:29:53.130,00:29:59.630
"the eigenvalues
of A transpose A.",00:29:59.630,00:30:03.470
Good.,00:30:03.470,00:30:04.760
"So I just take the square root,
if I want the eigenvalues of A",00:30:04.760,00:30:09.160
transpose --,00:30:09.160,00:30:10.020
"If I want the sigmas
and I know these,",00:30:10.020,00:30:11.990
"I take the square root,
the positive square root.",00:30:11.990,00:30:14.540
OK.,00:30:14.540,00:30:16.730
Where did I run into trouble?,00:30:16.730,00:30:20.610
"Well, then, my final
step was to find U.",00:30:20.610,00:30:25.220
And I didn't read the book.,00:30:25.220,00:30:28.270
"So, I did something that was
practically right, but --",00:30:28.270,00:30:35.480
"well, I guess practically
right is not quite the same.",00:30:35.480,00:30:38.880
"OK, so I thought, OK, I'll
look at A A transpose.",00:30:38.880,00:30:44.650
"What happened when I
looked at A A transpose?",00:30:44.650,00:30:47.420
"Let me just put it here,
and then I can feel it.",00:30:47.420,00:30:51.070
"OK, so here's A A transpose.",00:30:51.070,00:30:53.620
"So that's U sigma V
transpose, that's A,",00:30:57.120,00:31:01.050
"and then the transpose
is V sigma transpose,",00:31:01.050,00:31:05.240
U sigma transpose.,00:31:05.240,00:31:06.300
Fine.,00:31:06.300,00:31:07.930
"And then, in the middle
is the identity again,",00:31:07.930,00:31:10.610
so it looks great.,00:31:10.610,00:31:12.570
"U sigma sigma
transpose, U transpose.",00:31:12.570,00:31:17.050
Fine.,00:31:17.050,00:31:18.760
"All good, and now
these columns of U",00:31:18.760,00:31:26.570
"are the eigenvectors,
that's U is the eigenvector",00:31:26.570,00:31:29.900
matrix for this guy.,00:31:29.900,00:31:33.120
"That was correct,
so I did that fine.",00:31:33.120,00:31:36.960
Where did something go wrong?,00:31:36.960,00:31:38.600
A sign went wrong.,00:31:38.600,00:31:40.820
"A sign went wrong because --
and now -- now I see, actually,",00:31:40.820,00:31:44.570
"somebody told me
right after class,",00:31:44.570,00:31:49.140
"we can't tell from this
description which sign to give",00:31:49.140,00:31:53.910
the eigenvectors.,00:31:53.910,00:31:55.200
"If these are the
eigenvectors of this matrix,",00:31:55.200,00:32:00.570
"well, if you give
me an eigenvector",00:32:00.570,00:32:02.660
"and I change all
its signs, we've",00:32:02.660,00:32:04.790
still got another eigenvector.,00:32:04.790,00:32:06.920
"So what I wasn't
able to determine",00:32:06.920,00:32:08.970
"(and I had a fifty-fifty
change and life let me down,)",00:32:08.970,00:32:13.940
"the signs I just
happened to pick",00:32:13.940,00:32:16.600
"for the eigenvectors,
one of them",00:32:16.600,00:32:19.070
I should have reversed the sign.,00:32:19.070,00:32:21.750
"So, from this, I can't tell
whether the eigenvector",00:32:21.750,00:32:27.190
"or its negative is the
right one to use in there.",00:32:27.190,00:32:31.150
"So the right way to
do it is to, having",00:32:31.150,00:32:34.750
"settled on the
signs, the Vs also, I",00:32:34.750,00:32:38.640
"don't know which sign to
choose, but I choose one.",00:32:38.640,00:32:42.100
I choose one.,00:32:42.100,00:32:43.220
"And then, instead,
I should have used",00:32:43.220,00:32:50.290
"the one that tells me what
sign to choose, the rule",00:32:50.290,00:32:53.950
"that A times a V is
sigma times the U.",00:32:53.950,00:33:02.330
"So, having decided on
the V, I multiply by A,",00:33:02.330,00:33:07.140
"I'll notice the factor
sigma coming out,",00:33:07.140,00:33:09.640
"and there will be a
unit vector there,",00:33:09.640,00:33:11.520
"and I now know
exactly what it is,",00:33:11.520,00:33:17.310
"and not only up to
a change of sign.",00:33:17.310,00:33:20.380
"So that's the good
and, of course,",00:33:20.380,00:33:22.390
"this is the main
point about the SVD.",00:33:22.390,00:33:25.910
"That's the point that
we've diagonalized,",00:33:25.910,00:33:28.210
"that's A times the
matrix of Vs equals",00:33:28.210,00:33:32.950
"U times the diagonal
matrix of sigmas.",00:33:32.950,00:33:37.710
That's the same as that.,00:33:37.710,00:33:39.470
OK.,00:33:39.470,00:33:39.970
"So that's, like,
correcting the wrong sign",00:33:39.970,00:33:47.800
from that earlier lecture.,00:33:47.800,00:33:50.000
"And that would complete that,
so that's how you would compute",00:33:50.000,00:33:52.810
the SVD.,00:33:52.810,00:33:54.040
"Now, on the quiz, I going to
ask -- well, maybe on the final.",00:33:54.040,00:33:58.380
"So we've got quiz
and final ahead.",00:33:58.380,00:34:01.010
"Sometimes, you might be asked
to find the SVD if I give you",00:34:01.010,00:34:05.400
"the matrix -- let me come
back, now, to the main board --",00:34:05.400,00:34:10.870
"or, I might give you the pieces.",00:34:10.870,00:34:17.880
"And I might ask you
something about the matrix.",00:34:17.880,00:34:21.810
"For example, suppose I
ask you, oh, let's say,",00:34:21.810,00:34:31.580
if I tell you what sigma is --,00:34:31.580,00:34:36.590
OK.,00:34:36.590,00:34:37.460
Let's take one example.,00:34:37.460,00:34:39.230
Suppose sigma is --,00:34:39.230,00:34:43.820
"so all that's how we
would compute them.",00:34:43.820,00:34:46.350
"But now, suppose
I give you these.",00:34:46.350,00:34:48.070
"Suppose I give you sigma
is, say, three two.",00:34:48.070,00:34:52.320
"And I tell you that U
has a couple of columns,",00:34:57.130,00:35:02.110
and V has a couple of columns.,00:35:02.110,00:35:04.580
OK.,00:35:07.910,00:35:10.330
"Those are orthogonal
columns, of course,",00:35:10.330,00:35:12.600
because U and V are orthogonal.,00:35:12.600,00:35:14.630
"I'm just sort of,
like, getting you",00:35:14.630,00:35:16.120
"to think about the SVD,
because we only had that one",00:35:16.120,00:35:19.440
"lecture about it,
and one homework,",00:35:19.440,00:35:22.570
"and, what kind of a
matrix have I got here?",00:35:22.570,00:35:28.460
"What do I know
about this matrix?",00:35:28.460,00:35:31.970
"All I really know right now
is that its singular values,",00:35:31.970,00:35:35.540
"those sigmas are three and
two, and the only thing",00:35:35.540,00:35:39.390
"interesting that I can see in
that is that they're not zero.",00:35:39.390,00:35:43.190
"I know that this matrix
is non-singular, right?",00:35:43.190,00:35:48.390
"That's invertible, I don't
have any zero eigenvalues,",00:35:48.390,00:35:51.570
"and zero singular values,
that's invertible,",00:35:51.570,00:35:54.710
"there's a typical SVD for a
nice two-by-two non-singular",00:35:54.710,00:36:02.290
invertible good matrix.,00:36:02.290,00:36:04.990
"If I actually gave you
a matrix, then you'd",00:36:04.990,00:36:07.480
"have to find the Us and
the Vs as we just spoke.",00:36:07.480,00:36:10.390
"But, there.",00:36:10.390,00:36:12.000
"Now, what if the two
wasn't a two but it was --",00:36:12.000,00:36:16.400
"well, let me make an
extreme case, here --",00:36:16.400,00:36:18.520
suppose it was minus five.,00:36:18.520,00:36:20.050
"That's wrong, right away.",00:36:23.220,00:36:24.810
"That's not a singular
value decomposition, right?",00:36:24.810,00:36:28.590
"The singular values
are not negative.",00:36:28.590,00:36:30.840
"So that's not a singular value
decomposition, and forget it.",00:36:30.840,00:36:36.011
OK.,00:36:36.011,00:36:36.510
"So let me ask you
about that one.",00:36:36.510,00:36:40.200
"What can you tell me
about that matrix?",00:36:40.200,00:36:42.095
"It's singular, right?",00:36:45.090,00:36:47.340
"It's got a singular matrix
there in the middle,",00:36:47.340,00:36:50.480
"and, let's see, so,
OK, it's singular,",00:36:50.480,00:36:56.110
"maybe you can tell me, its rank?",00:36:56.110,00:37:01.870
What's the rank of A?,00:37:01.870,00:37:04.320
"It's clearly --
somebody just say it --",00:37:04.320,00:37:08.900
"one, thanks.",00:37:08.900,00:37:09.920
"The rank is one,
so the null space,",00:37:09.920,00:37:15.160
"what's the dimension
of the null space?",00:37:15.160,00:37:18.850
One.,00:37:18.850,00:37:19.890
Right?,00:37:19.890,00:37:20.390
"We've got a two-by-two
matrix of rank one,",00:37:20.390,00:37:23.940
"so of all that stuff from
the beginning of the course",00:37:23.940,00:37:26.820
is still with us.,00:37:26.820,00:37:30.310
"The dimensions of those
fundamental spaces",00:37:30.310,00:37:32.790
"is still central,
and a basis for them.",00:37:32.790,00:37:36.950
"Now, can you tell me a vector
that's in the null space?",00:37:36.950,00:37:40.890

point to make about the SVD.",00:37:40.890,00:37:47.000
"Can you tell me a vector
that's in the null space?",00:37:47.000,00:37:49.400

by and get zero, here?",00:37:54.410,00:38:00.820
"I think the answer
is probably v2.",00:38:00.820,00:38:04.120
"I think probably v2
is in the null space,",00:38:04.120,00:38:07.820

be the eigenvector going",00:38:07.820,00:38:11.950

Yes.,00:38:14.800,00:38:16.310

"And I could ask you the
null space of A transpose.",00:38:17.200,00:38:21.390
"And I could ask you
the column space.",00:38:21.390,00:38:23.050
All that stuff.,00:38:23.050,00:38:24.620
"Everything is sitting
there in the SVD.",00:38:24.620,00:38:27.180
"The SVD takes a little
more time to compute,",00:38:27.180,00:38:29.990
"but it displays all the
good stuff about a matrix.",00:38:29.990,00:38:36.090
OK.,00:38:36.090,00:38:36.720
Any question about the SVD?,00:38:36.720,00:38:39.680
"Let me keep going
with further topics.",00:38:39.680,00:38:47.800
"Now, let's see.",00:38:47.800,00:38:48.990
"Similar matrices
we've talked about,",00:38:48.990,00:38:51.050

got another, --",00:38:51.050,00:38:55.390
OK.,00:38:55.390,00:38:57.620
"Here's a true false, so
we can do that, easily.",00:38:57.620,00:39:04.570
So.,00:39:04.570,00:39:05.300
"Question, A given.",00:39:05.300,00:39:07.560
A is symmetric and orthogonal.,00:39:10.480,00:39:17.840
OK.,00:39:20.861,00:39:21.360
"So beautiful matrices like that
don't come along every day.",00:39:26.920,00:39:29.870
"But what can we say first
about its eigenvalues?",00:39:29.870,00:39:36.480
"Actually, of course.",00:39:36.480,00:39:38.680
"Here are our two most
important classes of matrices,",00:39:38.680,00:39:41.810
"and we're looking
at the intersection.",00:39:41.810,00:39:45.500
"So those really
are neat matrices,",00:39:45.500,00:39:48.470
"and what can you tell
me about what could",00:39:48.470,00:39:50.920
the possible eigenvalues be?,00:39:50.920,00:39:52.670
Eigenvalues can be what?,00:39:52.670,00:39:57.540

the eigenvalues",00:39:57.540,00:39:59.330

Ha.,00:40:10.260,00:40:12.370
Maybe nothing.,00:40:12.370,00:40:13.200

are like rotations,",00:40:33.800,00:40:36.280

are one.,00:40:40.921,00:40:41.420
Let me just show you why.,00:40:41.420,00:40:50.070
"So the matrix, can I
call it Q for orthogonal",00:40:50.070,00:40:53.920
Why? for the moment?,00:40:53.920,00:40:55.810

"do I see that this
thing has magnitude one?",00:40:58.760,00:41:03.570
I take the length of both sides.,00:41:03.570,00:41:06.140

is times the length of x.",00:41:08.930,00:41:13.520

you should know.",00:41:18.170,00:41:20.910

the length of x.",00:41:20.910,00:41:23.100
"Orthogonal matrices
don't change lengths.",00:41:23.100,00:41:26.400
So lambda has to be one.,00:41:26.400,00:41:30.330
Right.,00:41:30.330,00:41:31.090
OK.,00:41:31.090,00:41:31.890
"That's worth
committing to memory,",00:41:31.890,00:41:34.440

now to this question,",00:41:37.430,00:41:40.720

will have to get repeated.,00:42:35.630,00:42:37.270
Sure.,00:42:37.270,00:42:37.770
"So it's got repeated
eigenvalues, but,",00:42:37.770,00:42:40.040

What do I do?,00:44:04.750,00:44:05.510
I could see two ways to do this.,00:44:09.170,00:44:11.610
"I could check the properties
of a projection matrix, which",00:44:11.610,00:44:14.560
are what?,00:44:14.560,00:44:15.700
"A projection matrix
is symmetric.",00:44:15.700,00:44:18.520
"Well, that's certainly
symmetric, because A is.",00:44:18.520,00:44:21.790
And what's the other property?,00:44:21.790,00:44:24.440
"I should square
it, and hopefully",00:44:24.440,00:44:26.230
get the same thing back.,00:44:26.230,00:44:27.900
"So can I do that, square and see
if I get the same thing back?",00:44:27.900,00:44:32.230
"So if I square it, I'll get
one-quarter of A squared",00:44:32.230,00:44:37.060
"plus two A plus I, right?",00:44:37.060,00:44:40.640
"And the question is, does that
agree with p- the thing itself?",00:44:40.640,00:44:48.430
One-half A plus I.,00:44:48.430,00:44:53.480
Hm.,00:44:53.480,00:44:53.980
"I guess I'd like to know
something about A squared.",00:44:57.240,00:45:02.060
What is A squared?,00:45:02.060,00:45:03.260
That's our problem.,00:45:03.260,00:45:05.090
What is A squared?,00:45:05.090,00:45:06.260
"If A is symmetric
and orthogonal,",00:45:11.560,00:45:13.510
A is symmetric and orthogonal.,00:45:13.510,00:45:17.390
"This is what we're given, right?",00:45:22.060,00:45:23.710
"It's symmetric, and
it's orthogonal.",00:45:23.710,00:45:27.990
So what's A squared?,00:45:27.990,00:45:31.350
"I. A squared is I,
because A times A --",00:45:31.350,00:45:36.360
"if A equals its own inverse,
so A times A is the same as A",00:45:36.360,00:45:42.500
"times A inverse, which is I.",00:45:42.500,00:45:46.150
So this A squared here is I.,00:45:46.150,00:45:52.320
And now we've got it.,00:45:52.320,00:45:54.530
"We've got two identities
over four, that's good,",00:45:54.530,00:45:57.810

over four, that's good.",00:45:57.810,00:46:01.060
OK.,00:46:01.060,00:46:01.670
"So it turned out to be a
projection matrix safely.",00:46:01.670,00:46:05.960
"And we could also
have said, well,",00:46:05.960,00:46:08.310
"what are the eigenvalues
of this thing?",00:46:08.310,00:46:11.230

eigenvalues of A plus I?",00:46:17.970,00:46:21.840
"Just stay with it these
last thirty seconds here.",00:46:21.840,00:46:25.860
"What if I know these
eigenvalues of A,",00:46:25.860,00:46:29.140
"and I add the identity,
the eigenvalues",00:46:29.140,00:46:31.480
of A plus I are zero and two.,00:46:31.480,00:46:35.600
"And then when I divide by two,
the eigenvalues are zero and",00:46:35.600,00:46:39.480
one.,00:46:39.480,00:46:40.020
"So it's symmetric, it's
got the right eigenvalues,",00:46:40.020,00:46:43.130
it's a projection matrix.,00:46:43.130,00:46:45.070
"OK, you're seeing a lot of
stuff about eigenvalues,",00:46:45.070,00:46:49.290

that's what the quiz is about.",00:46:49.290,00:46:54.460
"OK, so good luck on the quiz.",00:46:54.460,00:46:57.230
