"PROFESSOR: In the twelfth
lecture, we're going to talk",00:00:22.780,00:00:25.340
about maxima and minima.,00:00:25.340,00:00:31.110
"Let's finish up what
we did last time.",00:00:31.110,00:00:33.110
"We really only just started
with maxima and minima.",00:00:33.110,00:00:35.710
"And then we're going to talk
about related rates.",00:00:35.710,00:00:38.100
"So, right now I want to give you
some examples of max-min",00:00:38.100,00:00:49.210
"problems. And we're going to
start with a fairly basic one.",00:00:49.210,00:00:55.540
"So what's the thing about
max-min problems?",00:00:55.540,00:00:58.540
"The main thing is that we're
asking you to do a little bit",00:00:58.540,00:01:02.150
"more of the interpretation of
word problems. So many of the",00:01:02.150,00:01:06.580
"problems are expressed
in terms of words.",00:01:06.580,00:01:09.970
"And so, in this case, we have
a wire which is length 1.",00:01:09.970,00:01:18.650
Cut into two pieces.,00:01:18.650,00:01:29.610
"And then each piece
encloses a square.",00:01:29.610,00:01:38.150
"Sorry, encloses a square.",00:01:38.150,00:01:44.400
"And the problem - so
this is the setup.",00:01:44.400,00:01:47.170
"And the problem is to find the
largest area enclosed.",00:01:47.170,00:02:02.650
So here's the problem.,00:02:02.650,00:02:03.910
"Now, in all of these cases, in
all these cases, there's a",00:02:03.910,00:02:10.570
bunch of words.,00:02:10.570,00:02:11.600
"And your job is typically
to draw a diagram.",00:02:11.600,00:02:18.700
"So the first thing you want to
do is to draw a diagram.",00:02:18.700,00:02:20.890
"In this case, it can be
fairly schematic.",00:02:20.890,00:02:23.340
Here's your unit length.,00:02:23.340,00:02:25.400
"And when you draw the diagram,
you're going to",00:02:25.400,00:02:27.590
have to pick variables.,00:02:27.590,00:02:29.370
"So those are really the
two main tasks.",00:02:29.370,00:02:34.700
To set up the problem.,00:02:34.700,00:02:35.665
So you're drawing a diagram.,00:02:35.665,00:02:37.170
"This is like word problems of
old, in grade school through",00:02:37.170,00:02:41.330
high school.,00:02:41.330,00:02:42.410
"Draw a diagram and name
the variables.",00:02:42.410,00:02:50.020
"So we'll be doing a
lot of that today.",00:02:50.020,00:02:52.900
So here's my unit length.,00:02:52.900,00:02:54.950
"And I'm going to choose the
variable x to be the length of",00:02:54.950,00:02:58.770
one of the pieces of wire.,00:02:58.770,00:03:00.280
"And that makes the other
piece 1 - x.",00:03:00.280,00:03:03.240
"And that's pretty much the whole
diagram, except that",00:03:03.240,00:03:06.430
"there's something that we
did with the wire after",00:03:06.430,00:03:08.210
we cut it in half.,00:03:08.210,00:03:09.710
"Namely, we built two little
boxes out of it.",00:03:09.710,00:03:13.370
"Like this, these are
our squares.",00:03:13.370,00:03:15.520
"And their side lengths are
x / 4 and (1 - x) / 4.",00:03:15.520,00:03:25.020
"So, so far, so good.",00:03:25.020,00:03:26.710
"And now we have to think, well,
we want to find the",00:03:26.710,00:03:29.390
largest area.,00:03:29.390,00:03:30.450
"So I need a formula for area
in terms of variables that",00:03:30.450,00:03:33.170
I've described.,00:03:33.170,00:03:34.490
And so that's the last thing.,00:03:34.490,00:03:35.790
"I'll give the letter a as
the label for the area.",00:03:35.790,00:03:39.400
"And then the area is just
the square of x/4 + the",00:03:39.400,00:03:47.080
square of 1 - x.,00:03:47.080,00:03:49.940
"Whoops, that strange
2 got in here.",00:03:49.940,00:03:52.720
Over 4.,00:03:52.720,00:03:57.780
"So far, so good.",00:03:57.780,00:03:59.110
"Now, The instinct that you'll
have, and I'm going to yield",00:03:59.110,00:04:02.720
"to that instinct, is we should
charge ahead and just",00:04:02.720,00:04:06.520
differentiate.,00:04:06.520,00:04:07.430
Alright?,00:04:07.430,00:04:07.870
That's alright.,00:04:07.870,00:04:08.460
"We'll find the critical
points.",00:04:08.460,00:04:10.430
"So we know that those are
important points.",00:04:10.430,00:04:12.995
"So we're going to find
the critical points.",00:04:12.995,00:04:17.840
"In other words, we take the
derivative we set, the",00:04:17.840,00:04:22.780
"derivative of a with
respect to x = 0.",00:04:22.780,00:04:27.390
"So if I do that differentiation,
I get the,",00:04:27.390,00:04:32.690
"well, so the first one,
x^2 / 16, that's 8.",00:04:32.690,00:04:37.240
Sorry.,00:04:37.240,00:04:40.870
"That's x / 8, right?",00:04:40.870,00:04:44.060
That's a derivative of this.,00:04:44.060,00:04:45.570
"And if I differentiate this, I
get well, the derivative of 1",00:04:45.570,00:04:51.050
- x ^2 is 2 ( 1 - x)( a - 1).,00:04:51.050,00:04:56.930
So it's - (1 - x) / 8.,00:04:56.930,00:05:03.170
"So there are two minus signs in
there, I'll let you ponder",00:05:03.170,00:05:06.420
"that differentiation, which
I did by the chain rule.",00:05:06.420,00:05:10.900
"Hang on a sec, OK?",00:05:10.900,00:05:12.730
Just wait until we're done.,00:05:12.730,00:05:14.960
So here's the derivative.,00:05:14.960,00:05:17.480
Is there a problem?,00:05:17.480,00:05:19.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:05:19.890,00:05:29.060
"PROFESSOR: Right, so there's
a 1/16 here.",00:05:29.060,00:05:31.320
This is x^2 / 16.,00:05:31.320,00:05:32.850
"And so it's 2x / 8,
over 16, sorry.",00:05:32.850,00:05:36.870
Which has an 8.,00:05:36.870,00:05:40.360
That's OK.,00:05:40.360,00:05:41.790
"Alright, so now, This is equal
to 0 if and only if x = 1 - x.",00:05:41.790,00:05:56.080
"That's 2x = = 1, or in
other words x = 1/2.",00:05:56.080,00:06:02.170
Alright?,00:06:02.170,00:06:03.280
So there's our critical point.,00:06:03.280,00:06:06.530
"So x = 1/2 is the
critical point.",00:06:06.530,00:06:11.710
"And the critical value, which
is what you get when you",00:06:11.710,00:06:18.570
"evaluate a at 1/2, is (1/2)
/ 4, that's 1/8.",00:06:18.570,00:06:26.260
"So that's (1/8)^2 + (1/8)^2
which = 1/32.",00:06:26.260,00:06:38.030
"So, so far, so good.",00:06:38.030,00:06:45.480
But we're not done yet.,00:06:45.480,00:06:48.050
We're not done.,00:06:48.050,00:06:56.850
So why aren't we done?,00:06:56.850,00:06:59.070
"Because we haven't checked
the end points.",00:06:59.070,00:07:04.590
So let's check the end points.,00:07:04.590,00:07:08.370
"Now, in this problem,
the end points are",00:07:08.370,00:07:10.540
really sort of excluded.,00:07:10.540,00:07:12.650
"The ends are between
0 and 1 here.",00:07:12.650,00:07:17.530
"That's the possible lengths
of the cut.",00:07:17.530,00:07:22.740
"And so what we should really be
doing is evaluating in the",00:07:22.740,00:07:25.580
"limit, so that would be the
right-hand limit as x",00:07:25.580,00:07:28.950
goes to 0 of a.,00:07:28.950,00:07:31.160
"And if you plug in x = 0, what
you get here is 0 + (1/4)^2.",00:07:31.160,00:07:39.450
Which is 1/16.,00:07:39.450,00:07:42.000
"And similarly, at the other
end, that's 1 - 1 from the",00:07:42.000,00:07:48.660
"left we get (1/4)^2 + 0,
which is also 1/16.",00:07:48.660,00:07:56.650
"So, what you see is that the
schematic picture of this",00:07:56.650,00:08:02.160
"function, and isn't even so far
off from being the right",00:08:02.160,00:08:06.840
"picture here, is that it's level
here as 1/16 and then it",00:08:06.840,00:08:12.120
dips down and goes up.,00:08:12.120,00:08:14.800
Right?,00:08:14.800,00:08:15.020
"This is 1/2, this is
1, and this level",00:08:15.020,00:08:18.970
here is a half that.,00:08:18.970,00:08:19.960
This is 1/32.,00:08:19.960,00:08:23.070
"So we did not find, when we
found the critical point we",00:08:23.070,00:08:26.660
"did not find the largest
area enclosed.",00:08:26.660,00:08:29.740
"We found the least
area enclosed.",00:08:29.740,00:08:33.060
"So if you don't pay attention
to what the function looks",00:08:33.060,00:08:36.060
"like, not only will you about
half the time get the wrong",00:08:36.060,00:08:39.760
"answer, you'll get the absolute
worst answer.",00:08:39.760,00:08:43.980
"You'll get the one which
is the polar opposite",00:08:43.980,00:08:47.420
from what you want.,00:08:47.420,00:08:49.680
"So you have to pay a little
bit of attention to the",00:08:49.680,00:08:51.970
function that you've got.,00:08:51.970,00:08:53.440
"And in this case it's
just very schematic.",00:08:53.440,00:08:55.530
"It dips down and goes up, and
that's true of pretty much",00:08:55.530,00:08:58.780
most functions.,00:08:58.780,00:08:59.560
They're fairly simple.,00:08:59.560,00:09:00.430
"They maybe only have
one critical point.",00:09:00.430,00:09:01.980
They only turn around once.,00:09:01.980,00:09:03.550
"But then, maybe the critical
point is the maximum or maybe",00:09:03.550,00:09:06.680
it's the minimum.,00:09:06.680,00:09:07.760
"Or maybe it's neither,
in fact.",00:09:07.760,00:09:09.670
"So we'll be discussing that
maybe some other time.",00:09:09.670,00:09:15.820
"So what we find here
is that we have",00:09:15.820,00:09:19.010
the least area enclosed.,00:09:19.010,00:09:26.260
Enclosed is 1/32.,00:09:26.260,00:09:30.420
And this is true when x = 1/2.,00:09:30.420,00:09:35.880
So these are equal squares.,00:09:35.880,00:09:44.190
"And most when there's
only one square.",00:09:44.190,00:09:55.970
"Which is more or less the
limiting situation.",00:09:55.970,00:10:00.480
"If one of the pieces
disappears.",00:10:00.480,00:10:05.490
"Now, so that's the first
kind of example.",00:10:05.490,00:10:09.840
"And I just want to make one more
comment about terminology",00:10:09.840,00:10:14.560
before we go on.,00:10:14.560,00:10:16.600
"And I will introduce it with
the following question.",00:10:16.600,00:10:20.690
What is the minimum?,00:10:20.690,00:10:31.510
"So, what is the minimum?",00:10:31.510,00:10:39.640
Yeah.,00:10:39.640,00:10:40.120
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:10:40.120,00:10:44.430
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:10:44.430,00:10:44.740
"The lowest value of
the function.",00:10:44.740,00:10:46.640
"So the answer to that
question is 1/32.",00:10:46.640,00:10:52.600
"Now, the problem with this
question and you will, so that",00:10:52.600,00:10:57.770
refers to the minimum value.,00:10:57.770,00:11:07.100
"But then there's this other
question which is",00:11:07.100,00:11:09.420
where is the minimum.,00:11:09.420,00:11:15.950
"And the answer to
that is x = 1/2.",00:11:15.950,00:11:22.390
"So one of them is the minimum
point, and the other one is",00:11:22.390,00:11:31.360
the minimum value.,00:11:31.360,00:11:33.640
"So they're two separate
things.",00:11:33.640,00:11:35.840
"Now, the problem is that
people are sloppy.",00:11:35.840,00:11:39.210
"And especially since you usually
find the critical",00:11:39.210,00:11:43.180
"point first, and the value
that is plugging in for a",00:11:43.180,00:11:48.620
"second, people will stop short
and they'll give the wrong",00:11:48.620,00:11:51.980
"answer to the question,
for instance.",00:11:51.980,00:11:54.010
"Now, both questions are
important to answer.",00:11:54.010,00:11:57.760
"You just need to have
a word to put there.",00:11:57.760,00:12:01.040
"So this is a little
bit careless.",00:12:01.040,00:12:02.490
"When we say what is
the minimum, some",00:12:02.490,00:12:03.900
people will say 1/2.,00:12:03.900,00:12:06.060
And that's literally wrong.,00:12:06.060,00:12:08.030
They know what they mean.,00:12:08.030,00:12:09.800
But it's just wrong.,00:12:09.800,00:12:10.890
"And when people ask
this question,",00:12:10.890,00:12:12.410
they're being sloppy.,00:12:12.410,00:12:13.520
Anyway.,00:12:13.520,00:12:14.210
"They should maybe be a little
clearer and say what's the",00:12:14.210,00:12:16.660
minimum value.,00:12:16.660,00:12:17.850
"Or, where is the
value achieved.",00:12:17.850,00:12:20.320
"It's achieved at, or where is
the minimum value achieved.",00:12:20.320,00:12:27.080
"""Where is min achieved?"",
would be a better way of",00:12:27.080,00:12:31.280
phrasing this second question.,00:12:31.280,00:12:34.050
"So that it has an unambiguous
answer.",00:12:34.050,00:12:37.900
"And when people ask you for
the minimum point, they're",00:12:37.900,00:12:41.910
"also - so why is it that we
call it the minimum point?",00:12:41.910,00:12:45.490
"We have this word, critical
point, which is what x = 1/2",00:12:45.490,00:12:48.510
is in critical value.,00:12:48.510,00:12:50.330
"And so I'm making those same
distinctions here.",00:12:50.330,00:12:52.840
"But there's another notion of
a minimum point, and this is",00:12:52.840,00:13:01.250
an alternative if you like.,00:13:01.250,00:13:09.340
"The minimum point is the
point (1/2, 1/32).",00:13:09.340,00:13:19.540
"Right, that's a point
on the graph.",00:13:19.540,00:13:25.350
"It's the point - well, so that
graph is way up there, but",00:13:25.350,00:13:29.640
I'll just put it on there.,00:13:29.640,00:13:30.740
That's this point.,00:13:30.740,00:13:33.780
And you might say min there.,00:13:33.780,00:13:36.010
"And you might point to this
point, and you might say max.",00:13:36.010,00:13:38.166
"And similarly, this one
might be a max.",00:13:38.166,00:13:42.540
"So in other words, what this
means is simply that people",00:13:42.540,00:13:47.970
are a little sloppy.,00:13:47.970,00:13:49.520
"And sometimes they mean
one thing and",00:13:49.520,00:13:50.860
sometimes they mean another.,00:13:50.860,00:13:53.770
"And you're just stuck with this,
because there'll be some",00:13:53.770,00:13:56.850
"authors who will say one thing
and some people will mean",00:13:56.850,00:13:59.020
"another and you just have to
live with this little bit of",00:13:59.020,00:14:02.130
annoying ambiguity.,00:14:02.130,00:14:05.150
Yeah?,00:14:05.150,00:14:05.690
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:14:05.690,00:14:08.280
"PROFESSOR: OK, so that's
a good - very good.",00:14:08.280,00:14:12.735
"So here we go, find the
largest area enclosed.",00:14:12.735,00:14:16.710
"So that's sort of a trick
question, isn't it?",00:14:16.710,00:14:22.290
"So there are various - that's
a good thing to ask.",00:14:22.290,00:14:28.410
"That's sort of a trick
question, why?",00:14:28.410,00:14:30.530
"Because according to the rules,
we're trapped between",00:14:30.530,00:14:36.460
"the two maxima at something
which is strictly below.",00:14:36.460,00:14:40.320
"So in other words, one answer to
this question would be, and",00:14:40.320,00:14:44.300
"this is the answer that I would
probably give, is 1/16.",00:14:44.300,00:14:48.000
But that's not really true.,00:14:48.000,00:14:50.640
"Because that's only
in the limit.",00:14:50.640,00:14:56.560
"As x goes to 0, or
as x goes to 1 -.",00:14:56.560,00:15:01.380
"And if you like, the
most is when you've",00:15:01.380,00:15:02.840
only got one square.,00:15:02.840,00:15:04.830
"Which breaks the rules
of the problem.",00:15:04.830,00:15:07.550
"So, essentially, it's
a trick question.",00:15:07.550,00:15:11.290
"But I would answer
it this way.",00:15:11.290,00:15:13.670
"Because that's the most
interesting part of the",00:15:13.670,00:15:15.900
"answer, which is that it's 1/16
and it occurs really when",00:15:15.900,00:15:19.840
"one of the squares disappears
to nothing.",00:15:19.840,00:15:28.920
"So now, let's do another
example here.",00:15:28.920,00:15:34.180
"And I just want to illustrate
the second style, or the",00:15:34.180,00:15:41.660
second type of question.,00:15:41.660,00:15:43.260
Yeah.,00:15:43.260,00:15:43.480
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:15:43.480,00:15:51.750
"PROFESSOR: The question is,
since the question was, what",00:15:51.750,00:15:56.540
"was the largest area, why did
we find the least area.",00:15:56.540,00:16:00.090
"The reason is that when we go
about our procedure of looking",00:16:00.090,00:16:04.050
"for the least, or the most,
we'll automatically find both.",00:16:04.050,00:16:10.220
"Because we don't know
which one is which",00:16:10.220,00:16:11.730
until we compare values.,00:16:11.730,00:16:14.730
"And actually, it's much more
to your advantage to figure",00:16:14.730,00:16:17.530
"out both the maximum and minimum
whenever you answer",00:16:17.530,00:16:21.360
such a question.,00:16:21.360,00:16:22.340
"Because otherwise you won't
understand the behavior of the",00:16:22.340,00:16:24.790
function very well.,00:16:24.790,00:16:26.590
"So, the question.",00:16:26.590,00:16:27.850
"We started out with one
question, we answered both.",00:16:27.850,00:16:30.500
We answered two questions.,00:16:30.500,00:16:31.750
"We answered the question of
what the largest and the",00:16:31.750,00:16:35.610
smallest value was.,00:16:35.610,00:16:37.290
"STUDENT: Also, I'm wondering
if you can check both the",00:16:37.290,00:16:40.834
"minimum [INAUDIBLE] approaches
[INAUDIBLE].",00:16:40.834,00:16:47.540
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:16:47.540,00:16:48.130
"One can also use, the question
is, can we use the second",00:16:48.130,00:16:50.470
"derivative test. And the
answer is, yes we can.",00:16:50.470,00:16:53.480
"In fact, you can actually also
stare at this and see that",00:16:53.480,00:16:56.070
it's a sum of squares.,00:16:56.070,00:16:57.590
So it's always curving up.,00:16:57.590,00:17:00.850
"It's a parabola with a positive
second coefficient.",00:17:00.850,00:17:04.710
"So you can differentiate
this twice.",00:17:04.710,00:17:06.670
"If you do you'll get
1/8 + another 1/8",00:17:06.670,00:17:09.670
and you'll get 1/16.,00:17:09.670,00:17:11.450
"So the second derivative
is 1/16.",00:17:11.450,00:17:14.540
Is 1/4.,00:17:14.540,00:17:17.730
"And that's an acceptable
way of figuring it out.",00:17:17.730,00:17:21.540
"I'll mention the second
derivative test again, in this",00:17:21.540,00:17:23.580
second example.,00:17:23.580,00:17:24.950
"So let me talk about
a second example.",00:17:24.950,00:17:32.580
"So again, this is going to
be another question.",00:17:32.580,00:17:35.070
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:17:35.070,00:17:37.950
"PROFESSOR: The question is, when
I say minimum or maximum",00:17:37.950,00:17:43.660
point which will I mean.,00:17:43.660,00:17:44.880
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:17:44.880,00:17:50.570
"PROFESSOR: So I just repeated
the question.",00:17:50.570,00:17:53.100
"So the question is,
when I say minimum",00:17:53.100,00:17:56.040
"point, what will I mean?",00:17:56.040,00:17:58.580
OK?,00:17:58.580,00:18:00.100
"And the answer is that for the
purposes of this class I will",00:18:00.100,00:18:05.860
probably avoid saying that.,00:18:05.860,00:18:09.090
"But I will say, probably, where
is the minimum achieved.",00:18:09.090,00:18:13.340
Just in order to avoid that.,00:18:13.340,00:18:14.680
"If I actually sat at I often am
referring to the graph, and",00:18:14.680,00:18:18.160
I mean this.,00:18:18.160,00:18:19.300
"And in fact, when you get your
little review for the second",00:18:19.300,00:18:21.870
"exam, I'll say exactly that
on the review sheet.",00:18:21.870,00:18:25.860
"And I'll make this very clear
when we were doing this.",00:18:25.860,00:18:28.750
"However, I just want to prepare
you for the fact that",00:18:28.750,00:18:30.800
"in real life, and even me when
I'm talking colloquially, when",00:18:30.800,00:18:35.720
"I say what's the minimum point
of something, I might actually",00:18:35.720,00:18:38.700
"be mixing it up with this
other notion here.",00:18:38.700,00:18:48.730
So let's do another example.,00:18:48.730,00:18:54.380
"So this is an example to get
us used to the notion of",00:18:54.380,00:18:58.750
constraints.,00:18:58.750,00:18:59.880
"So we have, so consider
a box without a top.",00:18:59.880,00:19:08.250
"Or, if you like, we're going to
find the box without a top.",00:19:08.250,00:19:16.860
"With least surface area
for a fixed volume.",00:19:16.860,00:19:35.380
"Find the box without a top with
least surface area for a",00:19:35.380,00:19:40.616
fixed volume.,00:19:40.616,00:19:42.360
"The procedure for working this
out is the following.",00:19:42.360,00:19:47.940
You make this diagram.,00:19:47.940,00:19:51.480
And you set up the variables.,00:19:51.480,00:19:56.220
"In this case, we're going to
have four names of variables.",00:19:56.220,00:20:00.390
"We have four letters that
we have to choose.",00:20:00.390,00:20:02.890
"And we'll choose them
in a kind of a",00:20:02.890,00:20:04.330
"standard way, alright?",00:20:04.330,00:20:05.680
"So first I have to tell
you one more thing.",00:20:05.680,00:20:08.260
"Which is something that we could
calculate separately but",00:20:08.260,00:20:13.000
"I'm just going to give
it to you in advance.",00:20:13.000,00:20:15.080
"Which is that it turns
out that the best box",00:20:15.080,00:20:16.920
has a square bottom.,00:20:16.920,00:20:21.420
"And that's going to get rid of
one of our variables for us.",00:20:21.420,00:20:24.710
"So it's got a square bottom,
and so let's draw",00:20:24.710,00:20:26.970
a picture of it.,00:20:26.970,00:20:28.500
So here's our box.,00:20:28.500,00:20:36.860
"Well, that goes down like this,
almost. Maybe I should",00:20:36.860,00:20:41.180
get it a little farther down.,00:20:41.180,00:20:49.620
So here's our box.,00:20:49.620,00:20:52.070
Let's correct that just a bit.,00:20:52.070,00:20:54.900
"So now, what about the
dimensions of this box?",00:20:54.900,00:20:57.760
"Well, this is going to be
x, and this is very",00:20:57.760,00:21:01.270
"foreshortened, but
it's also x.",00:21:01.270,00:21:03.180
"The bottom is x by x, it's
the same dimensions.",00:21:03.180,00:21:06.130
"And then the vertical
dimension is y.",00:21:06.130,00:21:12.190
"So far, so good.",00:21:12.190,00:21:13.750
"Now, I promised you two
more letter names.",00:21:13.750,00:21:16.620
I want to compute the volume.,00:21:16.620,00:21:21.040
"The volume is, the base is x
^2, and the height is y.",00:21:21.040,00:21:24.440
So there's the volume.,00:21:24.440,00:21:26.780
"And then the area, the area is
the area of the bottom, which",00:21:26.780,00:21:33.060
"is x ^2, that's the bottom.",00:21:33.060,00:21:37.940
"And then there are
the four sides.",00:21:37.940,00:21:40.510
"And the four sides are
rectangles of dimensions xy.",00:21:40.510,00:21:44.230
So it's 4xy.,00:21:44.230,00:21:49.500
So these are the sides.,00:21:49.500,00:21:53.630
"And remember, there's no top.",00:21:53.630,00:21:56.680
So that's our setup.,00:21:56.680,00:21:58.610
"So now, the difference between
this problem and the last",00:21:58.610,00:22:03.290
"problem is that there are two
variables floating around,",00:22:03.290,00:22:06.690
"namely x and y, which
are not determined.",00:22:06.690,00:22:09.710
"But there's what's called
a constraint here.",00:22:09.710,00:22:17.670
"Namely, we've fixed the
relationship between x and y.",00:22:17.670,00:22:22.920
"And so, that means that we can
solve for y in terms of x.",00:22:22.920,00:22:30.880
So y = v / x ^2.,00:22:30.880,00:22:40.650
"And then, we can plug that
into the formula for a.",00:22:40.650,00:22:43.660
"So here we have a which is
x ^2 + 4x ( v / x^2).",00:22:43.660,00:23:00.960
Question.,00:23:00.960,00:23:01.410
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:23:01.410,00:23:15.100
"PROFESSOR: The question is,
will you need to know this",00:23:15.100,00:23:16.720
intuitively?,00:23:16.720,00:23:17.350
No.,00:23:17.350,00:23:17.630
"That's something that I would
have to give to you.",00:23:17.630,00:23:20.830
"I mean, it's actually true
that a lot of things, the",00:23:20.830,00:23:26.070
"correct answer is something
symmetric.",00:23:26.070,00:23:28.040
"In this last problem, the
minimum turned out to be",00:23:28.040,00:23:30.730
"exactly halfway in between
because there were sort of",00:23:30.730,00:23:33.450
"equal demands from
the two sides.",00:23:33.450,00:23:35.900
"And similarly, here, what
happens is if you elongate one",00:23:35.900,00:23:38.750
"side, you get less - it actually
is involved with a",00:23:38.750,00:23:44.930
two variable problem.,00:23:44.930,00:23:46.050
"Namely, if you have a rectangle
and you have a",00:23:46.050,00:23:48.980
"certain amount of length
associated with it.",00:23:48.980,00:23:51.380
"What's the optimal thing
you can do with that.",00:23:51.380,00:23:53.720
"But I won't, in other words,
the optimal rectangle, the",00:23:53.720,00:23:58.660
"least perimeter rectangle,
turns out to be a square.",00:23:58.660,00:24:01.400
"That's the little sub-problem
that leads you",00:24:01.400,00:24:03.230
to this square bottom.,00:24:03.230,00:24:05.960
"But so that would have been a
separate max-min problem.",00:24:05.960,00:24:09.270
"Which I'm skipping, because I
what to do this slightly more",00:24:09.270,00:24:11.900
interesting one.,00:24:11.900,00:24:16.240
"So now, here's our formula for
a, and now I want to follow",00:24:16.240,00:24:22.110
the same procedure as before.,00:24:22.110,00:24:27.340
"Namely, we look for the
critical point.",00:24:27.340,00:24:29.320
Or points.,00:24:29.320,00:24:35.530
So let's take a look.,00:24:35.530,00:24:37.260
"So again, a is (x
^2 + 4v) / x.",00:24:37.260,00:24:43.430
And A' = 2x - (4v / x^2).,00:24:43.430,00:24:49.800
"So if we set that equal to
0, we get 2x = 2v / x ^2.",00:24:49.800,00:24:59.510
So 2x^3.,00:24:59.510,00:25:01.620
"How did that happen
to change into 2?",00:25:04.690,00:25:07.270
"Interesting, guess
that's wrong.",00:25:07.270,00:25:09.590
OK.,00:25:09.590,00:25:12.950
"So this is x ^ 3 = 2v. And so
x = (2 ^ 1/3)( v ^1/3).",00:25:12.950,00:25:28.010
So this is the critical point.,00:25:28.010,00:25:36.230
So we are not done.,00:25:36.230,00:25:38.040
Right?,00:25:38.040,00:25:38.670
"We're not done, because we don't
even know whether this",00:25:38.670,00:25:40.790
"is going to give us the worst
box or the best box, from this",00:25:40.790,00:25:43.960
point of view.,00:25:43.960,00:25:44.410
"The one that uses the most
surface area or the least. So",00:25:44.410,00:25:48.350
"let's check the ends,
right away.",00:25:48.350,00:25:51.990
To see what's happening.,00:25:51.990,00:25:54.030
"So can somebody tell me what
the ends, what the",00:25:54.030,00:25:56.490
end values of x are?,00:25:56.490,00:25:58.060
Where does x range from?,00:25:58.060,00:25:59.520

"PROFESSOR: What's the smallest
x can be, yeah.",00:26:05.480,00:26:07.040
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:26:07.040,00:26:16.520
"PROFESSOR: OK, the claim was
that the largest x could be",00:26:16.520,00:26:19.400
"root a, because somehow there's
this x ^2 here and you",00:26:19.400,00:26:23.500
"can't get any further
past than that.",00:26:23.500,00:26:25.685
"But there's a key feature
here of this problem.",00:26:25.685,00:26:28.700
Which is that a is variable.,00:26:28.700,00:26:32.050
"The only thing that's fixed in
the problem is v. So if v is",00:26:32.050,00:26:40.630

"PROFESSOR: x &gt; 0, yeah.",00:26:49.810,00:26:51.160
"The lower end point,
that's safe.",00:26:51.160,00:26:53.060
"Because that has to do
geometrically with the fact",00:26:53.060,00:26:55.440
"that we don't have any boxes
with negative dimensions.",00:26:55.440,00:26:59.430
"That would be refused by the
Post Office, definitely.",00:26:59.430,00:27:02.360
"Over and above the empty
top, which they",00:27:02.360,00:27:04.310
wouldn't accept either.,00:27:04.310,00:27:05.510
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:27:05.510,00:27:13.330
"PROFESSOR: It's true that x
&lt; square root of v / y.",00:27:13.330,00:27:17.260
"So that's using this
relationship.",00:27:17.260,00:27:19.250
But notice that y = v / x ^2.,00:27:19.250,00:27:26.850
"So 0 to infinity, I just
got a guess there over",00:27:26.850,00:27:30.270
"here, that's right.",00:27:30.270,00:27:32.080
Here's the upper limit.,00:27:32.080,00:27:33.350
"So this is really important
to realize.",00:27:33.350,00:27:35.750
"This is most problems. Most
problems, the variable if it",00:27:35.750,00:27:38.940
"doesn't have a limitation,
usually",00:27:38.940,00:27:40.800
just goes out to infinity.,00:27:40.800,00:27:42.370
"And infinity is a very important
end for the problem.",00:27:42.370,00:27:45.790
"It's usually an easy end
to the problem, too.",00:27:45.790,00:27:51.690
"So there's a possibility that if
we push all the way down to",00:27:51.690,00:27:54.030
"x = 0, we'll get a better box.",00:27:54.030,00:27:56.240
It would be very strange box.,00:27:56.240,00:27:58.230
"A little bit like our
vanishing enclosure.",00:27:58.230,00:28:01.620
"And maybe an infinitely
long box, also very",00:28:01.620,00:28:05.550
inconvenient one.,00:28:05.550,00:28:06.840
Might be the best box.,00:28:06.840,00:28:07.990
We'll have to see.,00:28:07.990,00:28:10.390
"So let's just take a look
at what happens.",00:28:10.390,00:28:12.810
"So we're looking at a, at 0 +.",00:28:12.810,00:28:18.740
"And that's x^2 + 4v
/ x with x at 0 +.",00:28:18.740,00:28:25.890
So what happens to that?,00:28:25.890,00:28:26.760
"Notice right here, this
is going to infinity.",00:28:26.760,00:28:35.220
So this is infinite.,00:28:35.220,00:28:38.500
"So that turns out
to be a bad box.",00:28:38.500,00:28:42.250
"Let's take a look at
the other end.",00:28:42.250,00:28:45.730
"So this is x ^2 + 4v / x,
x going to infinity.",00:28:45.730,00:28:51.930
"And again, this term
here means that",00:28:51.930,00:28:58.320
this thing is infinite.,00:28:58.320,00:28:59.930
"So the shape of this thing,
I'll draw this tiny little",00:28:59.930,00:29:02.730
schematic diagram over here.,00:29:02.730,00:29:05.000
"The shape of this thing
is like this, right?",00:29:05.000,00:29:11.110
"And so, when we find that one
turnaround point, which",00:29:11.110,00:29:14.200
"happened to be at this strange
point 2/3 , (2 ^ 1/3)( v ^",00:29:14.200,00:29:20.790
"1/3), that is going
to be the minimum.",00:29:20.790,00:29:24.440
"So we've just discovered
that it's the minimum.",00:29:24.440,00:29:30.090
"Which is just what we
were hoping for.",00:29:30.090,00:29:31.690
"This is going to be
the optimal box.",00:29:31.690,00:29:38.200
"Now, since you asked earlier and
since it's worth checking",00:29:38.200,00:29:45.240
"this as well, let's also check
an alternative justification.",00:29:45.240,00:29:51.740
"So an alternative to checking
ends is the second derivative",00:29:51.740,00:30:04.320
"test. I do not recommend the
second derivative test. I try",00:30:04.320,00:30:14.750
"my best, when I give you
problems, to make it really",00:30:14.750,00:30:17.140
"hard to apply the second
derivative test. But in this",00:30:17.140,00:30:19.840
"example, the function is simple
enough so that it's",00:30:19.840,00:30:22.930
perfectly OK.,00:30:22.930,00:30:24.570
"If you take the derivative
here, remember, this was",00:30:24.570,00:30:29.110
"whatever it was, 2x
- (4v / x ^2).",00:30:29.110,00:30:34.760
"If I take the second
derivative,",00:30:34.760,00:30:37.730
it's 2 + (8v / x ^3).,00:30:37.730,00:30:43.610
And that's positive.,00:30:43.610,00:30:45.310
So this thing is concave up.,00:30:45.310,00:30:49.580
"And that's consistent
with its being, the",00:30:49.580,00:30:52.290
critical point is a min.,00:30:52.290,00:30:59.840
Is a minimum point.,00:30:59.840,00:31:00.840
"See how I almost said,
is a min, as",00:31:00.840,00:31:03.790
opposed to minimum point.,00:31:03.790,00:31:05.180
So watch out.,00:31:05.180,00:31:05.870
Yes.,00:31:05.870,00:31:06.280
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:31:06.280,00:31:12.920
"PROFESSOR: You're one
step ahead of me.",00:31:12.920,00:31:13.860
"The question is, is this the
answer to the question or",00:31:13.860,00:31:16.080
"would we have to give y and
a and so on and so forth.",00:31:16.080,00:31:20.090
"So, again, this is something
that I want to emphasize and",00:31:20.090,00:31:24.060
take my time with right now.,00:31:24.060,00:31:26.220
"Because it depends, what kind
of real life problem you're",00:31:26.220,00:31:30.030
"answering, what kind of
answer is appropriate.",00:31:30.030,00:31:33.360
"So, so far we've found
the critical point.",00:31:33.360,00:31:36.010
"We haven't found the
critical value.",00:31:36.010,00:31:38.080
"We haven't found the dimensions
of the box.",00:31:38.080,00:31:42.190
"So we're going to spend a little
bit more time on this,",00:31:42.190,00:31:45.680
"exactly in order to address
these questions.",00:31:45.680,00:31:48.920
"So, first of all.",00:31:48.920,00:31:50.170
The value of y.,00:31:50.170,00:31:51.470
"So, so far we have x =
(2 ^ 1/3)( v ^ 1/3).",00:31:51.470,00:31:55.120
"And certainly if you're going
to build the box, you also",00:31:55.120,00:31:57.610
"want to know what
the y value is.",00:31:57.610,00:32:00.350
"The y value is going
to be, let's see.",00:32:00.350,00:32:04.970
"Well, it's v / x ^2, so that's
v / ((2 ^ 1/3)( v ^ 1/3) ^2,",00:32:04.970,00:32:12.110
"which comes out to be (2
^ - 2/3)( v ^ 1/3).",00:32:12.110,00:32:19.770
So there's the y value.,00:32:19.770,00:32:22.580
"On top of that, we could figure
out the value of a.",00:32:22.580,00:32:29.580
"So that's also a perfectly
reasonable part of the answer.",00:32:29.580,00:32:31.880
"Depending on what one is
interested in, you might care",00:32:31.880,00:32:34.840
"how much money it's going to
cost you to build this box.",00:32:34.840,00:32:38.200
This optimal box.,00:32:38.200,00:32:39.330
"And so you plug in
the value of a.",00:32:39.330,00:32:41.370
"So a, let's see, is up here.",00:32:41.370,00:32:43.370
It's x ^2 + 4v / x.,00:32:43.370,00:32:47.740
"So that's going to be ((2 ^
1/3)( v ^ 1/3) ^2 + (4v / (2 ^",00:32:47.740,00:32:58.010
1/3)( v ^ 1/3)).,00:32:58.010,00:33:02.330
"And if you work that all out,
what you get turns out to be 3",00:33:02.330,00:33:07.300
( 2 ^ 1/3)( v ^ 2/3).,00:33:07.300,00:33:13.730
"So if you like, one way of
answering this question is",00:33:13.730,00:33:18.330
these three things.,00:33:18.330,00:33:23.160
That would be the minimum point,00:33:23.160,00:33:25.010
corresponding to the graph.,00:33:25.010,00:33:26.490
"That would be the answer
to this question.",00:33:26.490,00:33:28.950
"But the reason why I'm carrying
it out in such detail",00:33:28.950,00:33:31.710
"is I want to show you that there
are much more meaningful",00:33:31.710,00:33:34.840
"ways of answering
this question.",00:33:34.840,00:33:37.150
So let me explain that.,00:33:37.150,00:34:02.810
"So let me go through some more
meaningful answers here.",00:34:02.810,00:34:07.290
"The first more meaningful answer
is the following idea",00:34:07.290,00:34:14.770
"simply, what are known as
dimensionless variables.",00:34:14.770,00:34:29.780
"So the first thing that you
notice is the scaling law.",00:34:29.780,00:34:33.050
"That a / v ^ 2/3 is
the thing that's a",00:34:33.050,00:34:36.120
dimensionless quantity.,00:34:36.120,00:34:37.260
"That happens to be
3 ( 2 ^ 1/3).",00:34:37.260,00:34:42.150
So that's one thing.,00:34:42.150,00:34:43.970
"If you want to expand the
volume, you'll have to expand",00:34:43.970,00:34:46.220
"the area by the 2/3 power
of the volume.",00:34:46.220,00:34:49.220
"And if you think of the area
as being in, say, square",00:34:49.220,00:34:54.800
"inches, and the volume of the
box as being in cubic inches,",00:34:54.800,00:35:00.000
"then you can see that this is
a dimensionless quantity and",00:35:00.000,00:35:02.450
"you have a dimensionless
number here, which is a",00:35:02.450,00:35:04.440
"characteristic independent
of what a and v were.",00:35:04.440,00:35:09.310
"The other dimensionless
quantity is the y:x.",00:35:09.310,00:35:15.710
So x : y.,00:35:15.710,00:35:19.640
"So, again, that's inches
divided by inches.",00:35:19.640,00:35:23.680
"And it's (2 ^ 1/3)( v ^ 1/3) /
( 2 ^ - 2/3)( v ^ 1/3), which",00:35:23.680,00:35:33.160
happens to be 2.,00:35:33.160,00:35:36.150
"So this is actually the best
answer to the question.",00:35:36.150,00:35:41.390
"And it shows you that the
box is a 2:1 box.",00:35:41.390,00:35:46.120
"If this is 2 and this is
1, that's the good box.",00:35:46.120,00:35:50.200
"And that is just the shape,
if you like, and",00:35:50.200,00:35:56.900
it's the optimal shape.,00:35:56.900,00:36:02.670
"And certainly that,
aesthetically, that's the",00:36:02.670,00:36:05.010
"cleanest answer to
the question.",00:36:05.010,00:36:12.460
"There was a question
right here.",00:36:12.460,00:36:13.520
Yes.,00:36:13.520,00:36:13.820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:36:13.820,00:36:20.930
"PROFESSOR: Could you repeat
that, I couldn't hear.",00:36:20.930,00:36:22.620
"STUDENT: I'm wondering if you'd
be able to get that",00:36:22.620,00:36:24.460
"answer if you [INAUDIBLE]
square.",00:36:24.460,00:36:30.220
"PROFESSOR: The question is,
could we have gotten the",00:36:30.220,00:36:31.870
"answer if we weren't told that
the bottom was square.",00:36:31.870,00:36:34.380
"The answer is, yes in 18.02
with multivariable.",00:36:34.380,00:36:39.160
"You would have to have three
letters here, an x, a y, and a",00:36:39.160,00:36:41.370
"z, if you like.",00:36:41.370,00:36:43.470
"And then you'd have to work
with all three of them.",00:36:43.470,00:36:48.170
"So I separated out into one,
there's a separate one",00:36:48.170,00:36:53.440
"variable problem that you
can do for the base.",00:36:53.440,00:36:55.550
"And then this is a second one
variable problem for this",00:36:55.550,00:36:57.870
other thing.,00:36:57.870,00:36:58.510
"And it's just two consecutive
one variable problems that",00:36:58.510,00:37:01.110
"solve the multivariable
problem.",00:37:01.110,00:37:03.170
"Or, as I say in multivariable
calculus, you can just do it",00:37:03.170,00:37:06.200
all in one step.,00:37:06.200,00:37:08.990
Yeah?,00:37:08.990,00:37:09.240
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:37:09.240,00:37:11.820
"PROFESSOR: Why did I divide
x by y, rather than",00:37:11.820,00:37:15.010
"y by x, or in any?",00:37:15.010,00:37:17.830
"So, again, what I was aiming
for was dimensionless",00:37:17.830,00:37:20.390
quantities.,00:37:20.390,00:37:22.320
"So x and y are measured
in the same units.",00:37:22.320,00:37:26.640
"And also the proportions
of the box.",00:37:26.640,00:37:29.430
"So that's another word for
this is proportions.",00:37:29.430,00:37:34.310
"Are something that's universal,
independent of the",00:37:34.310,00:37:37.980
"volume v. It's something
you can say about",00:37:37.980,00:37:39.980

to do some fancy --",00:37:48.950,00:37:50.530
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:37:50.530,00:37:55.540
"PROFESSOR: The proportions is
with geometric problems",00:37:55.540,00:37:58.630
"typically, when there's a
scaling to the problem.",00:37:58.630,00:38:01.700
"Where the answer is the
same at small scales",00:38:01.700,00:38:04.300
and at large scales.,00:38:04.300,00:38:05.280
This is capturing that.,00:38:05.280,00:38:07.000
"So that's why, the ratios are
what's capturing that.",00:38:07.000,00:38:10.070
"And that's why it's
aesthetically the",00:38:10.070,00:38:11.800
nicest thing to ask.,00:38:11.800,00:38:13.860
"STUDENT: So, what exactly does
the ratio of the area to the",00:38:13.860,00:38:18.730
"volume ratio [INAUDIBLE]
tell us?",00:38:18.730,00:38:21.910
"PROFESSOR: Unfortunately,
this number is a",00:38:21.910,00:38:23.390
really obscure number.,00:38:23.390,00:38:25.490
"So the question is what
does this tell us.",00:38:25.490,00:38:28.100
"The only thing that I want to
emphasize is what's on the",00:38:28.100,00:38:30.300
left-hand side here.,00:38:30.300,00:38:31.800
"Which is, it's the area to the
2/3 power of the volume, so",00:38:31.800,00:38:35.050
"it's a dimensionless quantity
that happens to be this.",00:38:35.050,00:38:38.550
"If you do this, for example,
in general with planar",00:38:38.550,00:38:41.760
"diagrams, circumferenced area
is a bad ratio to take.",00:38:41.760,00:38:47.200
"What you want to take
is the square of",00:38:47.200,00:38:49.020
circumference to area.,00:38:49.020,00:38:51.170
"Because the square of
circumference has the same",00:38:51.170,00:38:52.910
"dimensions; that is, say,
inches squared to area.",00:38:52.910,00:38:56.880
Which is in square inches.,00:38:56.880,00:38:58.840
"So, again, it's these
dimensionless quantities that",00:38:58.840,00:39:01.445
you want to cook up.,00:39:01.445,00:39:03.440
"And those are the ones that
will have universal",00:39:03.440,00:39:05.030
properties.,00:39:05.030,00:39:06.810
"The most famous of these is the
circle that encloses the",00:39:06.810,00:39:10.870
"most area for its
circumference.",00:39:10.870,00:39:13.880
"And, again, that's only true if
you take the square of the",00:39:13.880,00:39:18.290
circumference.,00:39:18.290,00:39:18.880
You do the units correctly.,00:39:18.880,00:39:25.620
Anyway.,00:39:25.620,00:39:26.290
"So we're here, we've
got a shape.",00:39:26.290,00:39:29.760
"We've got an answer
to this question.",00:39:29.760,00:39:31.560
"And I now want to
do this problem.",00:39:31.560,00:39:36.940
"Well, let's put it this way.",00:39:36.940,00:39:38.410
"I wanted to do this problem
by a different method.",00:39:38.410,00:39:40.350
"I think I'll take the
time to do it.",00:39:40.350,00:39:43.430
"So I want to do this problem
by a slightly",00:39:43.430,00:39:46.100
different method here.,00:39:46.100,00:39:48.880
"So, here's Example 2 by implicit
differentiation.",00:39:48.880,00:39:59.160
"So the same example, but now I'm
going to do it by implicit",00:39:59.160,00:40:02.420
differentiation.,00:40:02.420,00:40:03.720
"Well, I'll tell you the
advantages and disadvantages",00:40:03.720,00:40:07.050
to this method here.,00:40:07.050,00:40:08.880
"So the situation is, you have
to start the same way.",00:40:08.880,00:40:20.130
"So here is the starting
place of the problem.",00:40:20.130,00:40:24.230
"And the goal was the minimum
of a with v constant.",00:40:24.230,00:40:34.980
"So this was the situation
that we were in.",00:40:34.980,00:40:38.540
"And now, what I want to do
is just differentiate.",00:40:38.540,00:40:45.130
"The function y is implicitly
a function of x, so I can",00:40:45.130,00:40:47.970
"differentiate the first
expression.",00:40:47.970,00:40:54.550
"And that yields 0 = 2xy
+ (x ^2 )( y').",00:40:54.550,00:41:00.570
"So this is giving me my implicit
formula for y', So y'",00:41:03.330,00:41:07.570
= - 2xy / x ^2.,00:41:07.570,00:41:13.080
"Or in other words, - 2y / x.",00:41:13.080,00:41:19.660
"And then I also have
the dA/dx.",00:41:19.660,00:41:24.990
"Now, you may notice I'm not
using primes quite as much.",00:41:24.990,00:41:28.750
"Because all of the variables are
varying, and so here I'm",00:41:28.750,00:41:32.680
"emphasizing that it's a
differentiation with respect",00:41:32.680,00:41:34.750
to the variable x.,00:41:34.750,00:41:36.790
"And this becomes
2x + 4y + 4xy'.",00:41:36.790,00:41:48.130
"So again, this is using
the product rule.",00:41:48.130,00:41:53.140
"And now I can plug in for
what y' is, which",00:41:53.140,00:41:56.450
is right above it.,00:41:56.450,00:41:57.450
"So this is 2x + 4y
+ 4x ( - 2y / x).",00:41:57.450,00:42:09.330
And that's equal to 0.,00:42:09.330,00:42:14.150
"And so let's gather
that together.",00:42:14.150,00:42:24.770
So what do we have?,00:42:24.770,00:42:25.960
"We have 2x + 4y, and
then, altogether,",00:42:25.960,00:42:31.100
this is 8 - 8y = 0.,00:42:31.100,00:42:36.550
"So that's the same
thing as 2x = 4y.",00:42:36.550,00:42:41.600
"The - 4y goes to
the other side.",00:42:41.600,00:42:44.100
"And so, x / y = 2.",00:42:44.100,00:42:54.420
"So this, I claim, so you have
to decide for yourself.",00:42:54.420,00:42:59.260
"But I claim that
this is faster.",00:42:59.260,00:43:03.630
"It's faster, and also it gets
to the heart of the matter,",00:43:03.630,00:43:08.170
"which is this scale in
variant proportions.",00:43:08.170,00:43:10.870
Which is basically also nicer.,00:43:10.870,00:43:13.360
"So it gets to the nicer
answer, also.",00:43:13.360,00:43:16.720
"So those are the advantages
that this has.",00:43:16.720,00:43:19.970
"So it's faster, and it
gets to this, I'm",00:43:19.970,00:43:23.340
going to call it nicer.,00:43:23.340,00:43:26.260
"And the disadvantage is
it did not check.",00:43:26.260,00:43:41.890
"Whether this critical point
is a max, min, or neither.",00:43:41.890,00:43:59.540
"So we didn't quite finish
the problem.",00:43:59.540,00:44:02.280
"But we got to the answer very
fast. Yeah, question.",00:44:02.280,00:44:11.640
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:44:11.640,00:44:13.480
"PROFESSOR: How would
you check it?",00:44:13.480,00:44:17.760
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:44:17.760,00:44:18.270
"PROFESSOR: Well, so it gives
you a candidate.",00:44:18.270,00:44:20.510
"The answer is - so the
question is, how",00:44:20.510,00:44:22.410
would you check it?,00:44:22.410,00:44:23.390
"The answer is that for this
particular problem, the only",00:44:23.390,00:44:27.900
"way to do it is to do
something like this.",00:44:27.900,00:44:31.300
"So in other words, it doesn't
save you that much time.",00:44:31.300,00:44:34.480
"But with many, many, examples,
you actually can tell",00:44:34.480,00:44:38.420
"immediately that if the two
ends, the thing is, say, 0,",00:44:38.420,00:44:42.010
and inside it's positive.,00:44:42.010,00:44:43.650
Things like that.,00:44:43.650,00:44:44.370
"So in many, many, cases
this is just as good.",00:44:44.370,00:44:53.640
"So now I'm going to change
subjects here.",00:44:53.640,00:44:58.510
"But the subject that I'm going
to talk about next is almost,",00:44:58.510,00:45:03.590
"is very, very closely linked.",00:45:03.590,00:45:07.550
"Namely, I talked about implicit
differentiation.",00:45:07.550,00:45:10.850
"Now, we're going to just
talk about dealing",00:45:10.850,00:45:12.770
with lots of variables.,00:45:12.770,00:45:13.920
And rates of change.,00:45:13.920,00:45:15.360
"So, essentially, we're going
to talk about the",00:45:15.360,00:45:17.610
same type of thing.,00:45:17.610,00:45:19.680
"So, I'm going to tell you
about a subject which is",00:45:19.680,00:45:23.570
called related rates.,00:45:23.570,00:45:25.220
"Which is really just another
excuse for getting used to",00:45:25.220,00:45:28.150
"setting up variables
and equations.",00:45:28.150,00:45:32.510
"So, here we go.",00:45:32.510,00:45:34.320
Related rates.,00:45:34.320,00:45:36.000
"And i'm going to illustrate this
with one example today,",00:45:36.000,00:45:41.370
one tomorrow.,00:45:41.370,00:45:44.350
"So here's my example
for today.",00:45:44.350,00:45:47.600
"So, again, this is going
to be a police problem.",00:45:47.600,00:45:50.810
"But this is going to be a word
problem and - sorry, I'm don't",00:45:50.810,00:45:54.090
"want to scare you, no police.",00:45:54.090,00:45:56.910
"Well, there are police in the
story but they're not present.",00:45:56.910,00:45:59.940
"So, but I'm going to draw it
immediately with the diagram",00:45:59.940,00:46:05.070
"because I'm going to save
us the trouble.",00:46:05.070,00:46:08.410
"Although, you know, the point
here is to get from the words",00:46:08.410,00:46:11.580
to the diagram.,00:46:11.580,00:46:15.940
"So you have the police, and
they're 30 feet from the road.",00:46:15.940,00:46:21.990
And here's the road.,00:46:21.990,00:46:25.750
"And you're coming along, here,
in your, let's see, in your",00:46:25.750,00:46:36.910
"car going in this
direction here.",00:46:36.910,00:46:39.420
And the police have radar.,00:46:39.420,00:46:43.760
"Which is bouncing
off of your car.",00:46:43.760,00:46:46.490
"And what they read off is that
you're 50 feet away.",00:46:46.490,00:46:53.880
"They also know that you're
approaching along the line of",00:46:53.880,00:46:57.910
"the radar at a rate of
80 feet per second.",00:46:57.910,00:47:12.370
"Now, the question is,
are you speeding.",00:47:12.370,00:47:19.260
That's the question.,00:47:19.260,00:47:20.730
"So when you're speeding, by the
way, up 95 feet per second",00:47:20.730,00:47:29.030
is about 65 miles per hour.,00:47:29.030,00:47:32.090
So that's the threshold here.,00:47:32.090,00:47:35.890
"So what I want to do now is
show you how you set up a",00:47:35.890,00:47:41.360
problem like this.,00:47:41.360,00:47:43.860
This distance is 50.,00:47:43.860,00:47:46.150
"This is 30, and because it's
the distance to a straight",00:47:46.150,00:47:50.170
"line you know that this
is a right angle.",00:47:50.170,00:47:52.030
"So we know that this is
a right triangle.",00:47:52.030,00:47:54.580
"And this is set out to be a
right triangle, which is an",00:47:54.580,00:47:58.360
"easy one, a 3, 4, 5 right
triangle just so that we can",00:47:58.360,00:48:00.870
do the computations easily.,00:48:00.870,00:48:05.640
"So now, the question is, how
do we put the letters in to",00:48:05.640,00:48:09.320
"make his problem work, to
figure out what the",00:48:09.320,00:48:11.510
rate of change is.,00:48:11.510,00:48:12.310
"So now, let me explain
that right now.",00:48:12.310,00:48:15.930
"And we will actually do the
computation next time.",00:48:15.930,00:48:18.590
"So the first thing is, you
have to understand what's",00:48:18.590,00:48:22.140
changing and what's not.,00:48:22.140,00:48:24.850
"And we're going to use t
for time, in seconds.",00:48:24.850,00:48:30.880
"And now, an important distance
here is the distance to this",00:48:30.880,00:48:36.830
foot of this perpendicular.,00:48:36.830,00:48:37.820
So I'm going to name that x.,00:48:37.820,00:48:41.310
"I'm going to give
that letter x.",00:48:41.310,00:48:42.710
"Now, x is varying.",00:48:42.710,00:48:44.480
"The reason why I need a letter
for it as opposed to this 40",00:48:44.480,00:48:47.360
"is that it's going to have
a rate of change",00:48:47.360,00:48:49.150
with respect to t.,00:48:49.150,00:48:50.220
"And, in fact, it's related to,
the question is whether dx /",00:48:50.220,00:48:55.300
"dt is faster or slower
than 95.",00:48:55.300,00:49:00.460
"So that's the thing
that's varying.",00:49:00.460,00:49:01.890
"Now, there's something
else that's varying.",00:49:01.890,00:49:04.010
"This distance here
is also varying.",00:49:04.010,00:49:06.000
So we need a letter for that.,00:49:06.000,00:49:08.760
"We do not need a letter
for this.",00:49:08.760,00:49:11.620
Because it's never changing.,00:49:11.620,00:49:12.920
"We're assuming the police
are parked.",00:49:12.920,00:49:15.010
"They're not ready to roar out
and catch you just yet, and",00:49:15.010,00:49:17.820
"they're certainly not in motion
when they've got the",00:49:17.820,00:49:19.420
radar guns aimed at you.,00:49:19.420,00:49:20.880
"So you need to know something
about the sociology",00:49:20.880,00:49:24.110
and style of police.,00:49:24.110,00:49:28.160
"So you need to know things
about the real world.",00:49:28.160,00:49:30.950
"Now, the last bit is, what
about this 80 here.",00:49:30.950,00:49:36.370
"So this is how fast you're
approaching.",00:49:36.370,00:49:37.770
"Now, that's measured along
the radar gun.",00:49:37.770,00:49:40.290
"I claim that that's d by dt
of this quantity here.",00:49:40.290,00:49:44.950
So this is d is also changing.,00:49:44.950,00:49:46.910
"That's why we needed a
letter for it, too.",00:49:46.910,00:49:49.200
"So, next time, we'll just put
that all together and",00:49:49.200,00:49:52.090
compute dx / dt.,00:49:52.090,00:49:55.010
