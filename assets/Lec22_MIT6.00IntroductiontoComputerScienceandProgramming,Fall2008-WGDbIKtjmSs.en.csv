"PROFESSOR: So, if you remember,
just before the",00:00:19.980,00:00:25.420
"break, as long ago as it was,
we had looked at the problem",00:00:25.420,00:00:30.710
of fitting curves to data.,00:00:30.710,00:00:35.520
"And the example we had seen, is
that it's often possible,",00:00:35.520,00:00:42.690
"in fact, usually possible, to
find a good fit to old values.",00:00:42.690,00:00:49.060
"What we looked at was, we looked
at a small number of",00:00:49.060,00:00:51.460
"points, we took a high degree
polynomial, sure enough, we",00:00:51.460,00:00:54.800
got a great fit.,00:00:54.800,00:00:57.970
"The difficulty was, a great
fit to old values does not",00:00:57.970,00:01:03.210
"necessarily imply a good
fit to new values.",00:01:03.210,00:01:24.840
"And in general, that's
somewhat worrisome.",00:01:24.840,00:01:31.150
"So now I want to spend a little
bit of time I'm looking",00:01:31.150,00:01:34.560
"at some tools, that we can use
to better understand the",00:01:34.560,00:01:38.850
"notion of, when we have a
bunch of points, what",00:01:38.850,00:01:43.190
do they look like?,00:01:43.190,00:01:45.220
How does the variation work?,00:01:45.220,00:01:47.610
"This gets back to a concept that
we've used a number of",00:01:47.610,00:01:51.680
"times, which is a notion
of a distribution.",00:01:51.680,00:01:59.540
"Remember, the whole logic
behind our idea of using",00:01:59.540,00:02:04.860
"simulation, or polling, or any
kind of statistical technique,",00:02:04.860,00:02:11.340
"is the assumption that the
values we would draw were",00:02:11.340,00:02:16.160
"representative of the values
of the larger population.",00:02:16.160,00:02:21.650
"We're sampling some subset of
the population, and we're",00:02:21.650,00:02:25.540
"assuming that that sample is
representative of the greater",00:02:25.540,00:02:30.150
population.,00:02:30.150,00:02:31.700
"We talked about several
different",00:02:31.700,00:02:33.170
issues related to that.,00:02:33.170,00:02:36.130
"I now want to look at that a
little bit more formally.",00:02:36.130,00:02:40.400
"And we'll start with the very
old problem of rolling dice.",00:02:40.400,00:02:47.760
"I presume you've all
seen what a pair of",00:02:47.760,00:02:50.026
"dice look like, right?",00:02:50.026,00:02:51.570
"They've got the numbers 1
through 6 on them, you roll",00:02:51.570,00:02:54.590
them and something comes up.,00:02:54.590,00:02:57.730
"If you haven't seen it, if you
look at the very back, at the",00:02:57.730,00:03:01.700
"back page of the handout today,
you'll see a picture of",00:03:01.700,00:03:05.040
a very old die.,00:03:05.040,00:03:06.740
"Some time from the fourth to
the second century BC.",00:03:06.740,00:03:11.040
"Looks remarkably like a modern
dice, except it's not made out",00:03:11.040,00:03:15.260
"of plastic, it's made
out of bones.",00:03:15.260,00:03:18.610
"And in fact, if you were
interested in the history of",00:03:18.610,00:03:20.970
"gambling, or if you happen to
play with dice, people do call",00:03:20.970,00:03:23.790
them bones.,00:03:23.790,00:03:25.610
"And that just dates back to
the fact that the original",00:03:25.610,00:03:28.320
ones were made that way.,00:03:28.320,00:03:30.770
"And in fact, what we'll see
is, that in the history of",00:03:30.770,00:03:35.505
"probability and statistics, an
awful lot of the math that we",00:03:35.505,00:03:39.020
"take for granted today, came
from people's attempts to",00:03:39.020,00:03:42.240
"understand various
games of chance.",00:03:42.240,00:03:46.290
"So, let's look at it.",00:03:46.290,00:03:50.230
So we'll look at this program.,00:03:50.230,00:03:53.610
"You should have this in the
front of the handout.",00:03:53.610,00:04:05.660
"So I'm going to start
with a fair dice.",00:04:05.660,00:04:08.960
"That is to say, when you roll
it, it's equally probable that",00:04:08.960,00:04:11.660
"you get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.",00:04:11.660,00:04:18.360
And I'm going to throw a pair.,00:04:18.360,00:04:20.830
You can see it's very simple.,00:04:20.830,00:04:23.930
"I'll take d 1, first die is
random dot choice from vals 1.",00:04:23.930,00:04:30.910
"d 2 will be random dot
choice from vals 2.",00:04:30.910,00:04:34.370
"So I'm going to pass it in two
sets of possible values, and",00:04:34.370,00:04:40.100
"randomly choose one or the
other, and then return them.",00:04:40.100,00:04:45.710
"And the way I'll conduct a
trial is, I'll take some",00:04:45.710,00:04:49.660
"number of throws, and two
different kinds of dice.",00:04:49.660,00:04:53.940
"Throws will be the empty
set, actually, yeah.",00:04:53.940,00:04:58.840
And then I'll just do it.,00:04:58.840,00:05:01.070
"For i in range number of throws,
d 1, d 2 is equal to",00:05:01.070,00:05:06.270
"throw a pair, and then
I'll append it, and",00:05:06.270,00:05:08.480
then I'll return it.,00:05:08.480,00:05:12.940
"Very simple, right?",00:05:12.940,00:05:14.660
"Could hardly imagine a simpler
little program.",00:05:14.660,00:05:19.130
"And then, we'll analyze it.",00:05:19.130,00:05:21.740
And we're going to analyze it.,00:05:21.740,00:05:22.960
"Well, first let's analyze it one
way, and then we'll look",00:05:22.960,00:05:25.430
"at something slightly
different.",00:05:25.430,00:05:41.050
"I'm going to conduct some
number of trials",00:05:41.050,00:05:43.200
with two fair die.,00:05:43.200,00:05:46.120
"Then I'm going to make a
histogram, because I happen to",00:05:46.120,00:05:50.270
"know that there are only
11 possible values,",00:05:50.270,00:05:55.730
I'll make 11 bins.,00:05:55.730,00:06:01.600
"You may not have seen
this locution",00:06:01.600,00:06:03.620
"here, Pylab dot x ticks.",00:06:03.620,00:06:06.710
"That's telling it where to put
the markers on the x-axis, and",00:06:06.710,00:06:10.680
what they should be.,00:06:10.680,00:06:12.460
"In this case 2 through 12,
and then I'll label it.",00:06:12.460,00:06:16.450
So let's run this program.,00:06:16.450,00:06:29.960
"And here we see the distribution
of values.",00:06:29.960,00:06:34.760
"So we see that I get more 7s
than anything else, and fewer",00:06:34.760,00:06:39.220
2s and 12s.,00:06:39.220,00:06:42.320
"Snake eyes and boxcars
to you gamblers.",00:06:42.320,00:06:47.540
"And it's a beautiful
distribution, in some sense.",00:06:47.540,00:06:51.090
I ran it enough trials.,00:06:51.090,00:06:53.150
"This kind of distribution
is called normal.",00:06:53.150,00:07:01.240
"Also sometimes called
Gaussian, after the",00:07:01.240,00:07:03.780
mathematician Gauss.,00:07:03.780,00:07:07.060
"Sometimes called the bell curve,
because in someone's",00:07:07.060,00:07:12.110
"imagination it looks
like a bell.",00:07:12.110,00:07:16.650
"We see these things
all the time.",00:07:16.650,00:07:22.370
"They're called normal, or
sometimes even natural,",00:07:22.370,00:07:27.110
"because it's probably the most
commonly observed probability",00:07:27.110,00:07:30.800
distribution in nature.,00:07:30.800,00:07:35.460
"First documented, although I'm
sure not first seen, by",00:07:35.460,00:07:40.240
"deMoivre and Laplace
in the 1700s.",00:07:40.240,00:07:44.470
"And then in the 1800s, Gauss
used it to analyze",00:07:44.470,00:07:48.340
astronomical data.,00:07:48.340,00:07:51.980
"And it got to be called, in
that case, the Gaussian",00:07:51.980,00:07:54.280
distribution.,00:07:54.280,00:07:57.250
So where do we see it occur?,00:07:57.250,00:07:58.890
"We see it occurring all
over the place.",00:07:58.890,00:08:00.870
"We certainly see it
rolling dice.",00:08:00.870,00:08:04.000
"We see it occur in things like
the distribution of heights.",00:08:04.000,00:08:09.180
"If we were to take the height of
all the students at MIT and",00:08:09.180,00:08:12.700
"plot the distribution, I would
be astonished if it didn't",00:08:12.700,00:08:17.100
look more or less like that.,00:08:17.100,00:08:18.700
"It would be a normal
distribution.",00:08:18.700,00:08:22.280
"A lot of things in
the same height.",00:08:22.280,00:08:24.050
"Now presumably, we'd have to
round off to the nearest",00:08:24.050,00:08:26.980
millimeter or something.,00:08:26.980,00:08:29.380
"And a few really tall people,
and a few really short people.",00:08:29.380,00:08:35.250
"It's just astonishing in nature
how often we look at",00:08:35.250,00:08:39.010
these things.,00:08:39.010,00:08:40.690
"The graph looks exactly like
that, or similar to that.",00:08:40.690,00:08:44.900
The shape is roughly that.,00:08:44.900,00:08:47.880
"The normal distribution can be
described, interestingly",00:08:47.880,00:08:53.460
"enough, with just two numbers.",00:08:53.460,00:08:57.700
"The mean and the standard
deviation.",00:08:57.700,00:09:13.400
"So if I give you those
two numbers, you",00:09:13.400,00:09:15.920
can draw that curve.,00:09:15.920,00:09:18.540
"Now you might not be able to
label, you couldn't label the",00:09:18.540,00:09:21.920
"axes, because how would
you know how many",00:09:21.920,00:09:25.210
"trials I did, right?",00:09:25.210,00:09:26.540
"Whether I did 100, or 1,000 or a
million, but the shape would",00:09:26.540,00:09:29.720
always be the same.,00:09:29.720,00:09:34.970
"And if I were to, instead of
doing, 100,000 throws of the",00:09:34.970,00:09:39.180
"dice, as I did here, I did a
million, the label on the",00:09:39.180,00:09:44.030
"y-axis would change,
but the shape would",00:09:44.030,00:09:47.310
be absolutely identical.,00:09:47.310,00:09:51.370
"This is what's called a
stable distribution.",00:09:51.370,00:09:54.430
"As you change the scale, the
shape doesn't change.",00:09:54.430,00:10:14.160
"So the mean tells us where
it's centered, and the",00:10:14.160,00:10:18.370
"standard deviation, basically,
is a measure of statistical",00:10:18.370,00:10:23.500
dispersion.,00:10:23.500,00:10:42.570
"It tells us how widely
spread the points of",00:10:42.570,00:10:45.400
the data set are.,00:10:45.400,00:10:48.460
"If many points are going to be
very close to the mean, then",00:10:48.460,00:10:52.420
"the standard deviation is
what, big or small?",00:10:52.420,00:10:57.650
Pardon?,00:10:57.650,00:10:59.090
Small.,00:10:59.090,00:11:04.720
"If they're spread out, and it's
kind of a flat bell, then",00:11:04.720,00:11:08.950
"the standard deviation
will be large.",00:11:08.950,00:11:13.750
"And I'm sure you've all seen
standard deviations.",00:11:13.750,00:11:16.980
"We give exams, and we say here's
the mean, here's the",00:11:16.980,00:11:19.500
standard deviation.,00:11:19.500,00:11:22.630
"And the notion is, that's trying
to tell you what the",00:11:22.630,00:11:25.170
"average score was, and how
spread out they are.",00:11:25.170,00:11:29.280
"Now as it happens, rarely do
we have exams that actually",00:11:29.280,00:11:35.080
fall on a bell curve.,00:11:35.080,00:11:37.050
Like this.,00:11:37.050,00:11:38.270
"So in a way, don't be deceived
by thinking that we're really",00:11:38.270,00:11:44.710
"giving you a good measure of the
dispersion, in the sense,",00:11:44.710,00:11:48.790
"that we would get with
the bell curve.",00:11:48.790,00:11:52.880
"So the standard deviation does
have a formal value, usually",00:11:52.880,00:11:58.420
"written sigma, and it's the
estimates of x squared minus",00:11:58.420,00:12:11.440
"the estimates of x, and then
I take all of this, the",00:12:11.440,00:12:18.840
"estimates of x, right,
squared.",00:12:18.840,00:12:26.790
"So I don't worry much about
this, but what I'm basically",00:12:26.790,00:12:29.300
"doing is, x is all of the
values I have. And I can",00:12:29.300,00:12:36.200
"square each of the values, and
then I subtract from that, the",00:12:36.200,00:12:44.500
"sum of the values,
squaring that.",00:12:44.500,00:12:50.670
"What's more important than this
formula, for most uses,",00:12:50.670,00:12:54.730
"is what people think of as the
-- why didn't I write it down",00:12:54.730,00:13:03.480
-- this is interesting.,00:13:03.480,00:13:07.580
There is a some number --,00:13:07.580,00:13:09.260
"I see why, I did write
it down, it just",00:13:09.260,00:13:10.930
got printed on two-sided.,00:13:10.930,00:13:12.280
Is the Empirical Rule.,00:13:12.280,00:13:26.540
"And this applies for normal
distributions.",00:13:26.540,00:13:35.370
"So anyone know how much of the
data that you should expect to",00:13:35.370,00:13:38.680
"fall within one standard
deviation of the mean?",00:13:38.680,00:13:44.120
68.,00:13:44.120,00:13:49.200
"So 68% within one, 95% of the
data falls within two, and",00:13:49.200,00:13:59.330
"almost all of the data
within three.",00:13:59.330,00:14:06.720
"These values are approximations,
by the way.",00:14:06.720,00:14:11.080
"So, this is, really 95% falls
within 1.96 standard",00:14:11.080,00:14:20.070
"deviations, it's not two.",00:14:20.070,00:14:23.530
"But this gives you a sense
of how spread out it is.",00:14:23.530,00:14:28.330
"And again, this applies only
for a normal distribution.",00:14:28.330,00:14:33.770
"If you compute the standard
deviation this way, and apply",00:14:33.770,00:14:37.650
"it to something other than a
normal distribution, there's",00:14:37.650,00:14:40.910
"no reason to expect that
Empirical Rule will hold.",00:14:40.910,00:14:52.130
OK people with me on this?,00:14:52.130,00:14:55.330
"It's amazing to me how many
people in society talk about",00:14:55.330,00:14:58.560
"standard deviations
without actually",00:14:58.560,00:15:01.190
knowing what they are.,00:15:01.190,00:15:02.860
"And there's another way to
look at the same data, or",00:15:02.860,00:15:06.010
almost the same data.,00:15:06.010,00:15:07.120
"Since it's a random experiment,
it won't be",00:15:07.120,00:15:08.990
exactly the same.,00:15:08.990,00:15:22.220
"So as before, we had the
distribution, and fortunately",00:15:22.220,00:15:28.670
"it looks pretty much
like the last one.",00:15:28.670,00:15:30.890
We would've expected that.,00:15:30.890,00:15:32.950
"And I've now done something,
another way of looking at the",00:15:32.950,00:15:35.940
"same information, really, is,
I printed, I plotted, the",00:15:35.940,00:15:42.050
"probabilities of different
values.",00:15:42.050,00:15:46.900
"So we can see here that the
probability of getting a 7 is",00:15:46.900,00:15:52.950
"about 0.17 or something
like that.",00:15:52.950,00:15:59.120
"Now, since I threw 100,000 die,
it's not surprising that",00:15:59.120,00:16:03.200
"the probability of 0.17
looks about the same",00:16:03.200,00:16:07.050
"as 17,000 over here.",00:16:07.050,00:16:11.540
"But it's just a different way
of looking at things.",00:16:11.540,00:16:15.770
"Right, had I thrown some
different number, it might",00:16:15.770,00:16:21.480
"have been harder to visualize
what the probability",00:16:21.480,00:16:23.900
distribution looked like.,00:16:23.900,00:16:26.000
"But we often do talk
about that.",00:16:26.000,00:16:28.140
"How probable is a
certain value?",00:16:28.140,00:16:35.380
"People who design games of
chance, by the way, something",00:16:35.380,00:16:39.210
I've been meaning to say.,00:16:39.210,00:16:39.960
"You'll notice down here there's
just, when we want to",00:16:39.960,00:16:42.690
"save these things, there's
this little icon that's a",00:16:42.690,00:16:45.840
"floppy disk, to indicate
store.",00:16:45.840,00:16:48.800
"And I thought maybe many of
you'd never seen a floppy",00:16:48.800,00:16:51.260
"disk, so I decided
to bring one in.",00:16:51.260,00:16:53.730
You've seen the icons.,00:16:53.730,00:16:55.500
"And probably by the time most of
you got, any you ever had a",00:16:55.500,00:16:58.590
"machine with a quote
floppy drive?",00:16:58.590,00:17:01.310
Did it actually flop the disk?,00:17:01.310,00:17:04.030
"No, they were pretty rigid, but
the old floppy disks were",00:17:04.030,00:17:07.540
really floppy.,00:17:07.540,00:17:09.840
Hence they got the name.,00:17:09.840,00:17:12.670
"And, you know it's kind of like
a giant size version.",00:17:12.670,00:17:16.580
"And it's amazing how people will
probably continue to talk",00:17:16.580,00:17:19.800
"about floppy disks as
long as they talk",00:17:19.800,00:17:21.770
about dialing a telephone.,00:17:21.770,00:17:24.270
"And probably none of you've ever
actually dialed a phone,",00:17:24.270,00:17:27.190
"for that matter, just
pushed buttons .",00:17:27.190,00:17:29.820
"But they used to have dials
that you would twirl.",00:17:29.820,00:17:33.040
"Anyway, I just thought everyone
should at least see a",00:17:33.040,00:17:35.060
floppy disk once.,00:17:35.060,00:17:37.250
"This is, by the way, a very good
way to get data security.",00:17:37.250,00:17:40.140
"There's probably no way in the
world to read the information",00:17:40.140,00:17:42.510
on this disk anymore.,00:17:42.510,00:17:48.870
"All right, as I said people
who design games of chance",00:17:48.870,00:17:55.060
"understand these probabilities
very well.",00:17:55.060,00:17:58.430
"So I'm gonna now look at, show
how we can understand these",00:17:58.430,00:18:02.010
"things in some other ways
of popular example.",00:18:02.010,00:18:06.950
A game of dice.,00:18:06.950,00:18:09.410
"Has anyone here ever played
the game called craps?",00:18:09.410,00:18:13.520
Did you win or lose money?,00:18:13.520,00:18:16.390
You won.,00:18:16.390,00:18:18.050
"All right, you beat the odds.",00:18:18.050,00:18:21.880
"Well, it's a very popular
game, and I'm going to",00:18:21.880,00:18:23.780
explain it to you.,00:18:23.780,00:18:25.020
"As you will see, this is not
an endorsement of gambling,",00:18:25.020,00:18:28.150
"because one of the things you
will notice is, you are likely",00:18:28.150,00:18:30.370
to lose money if you do this.,00:18:30.370,00:18:32.590
"So I tend not, I don't do it.",00:18:32.590,00:18:35.800
"All right, so how does
a game of craps work?",00:18:35.800,00:18:45.830
You start by rolling two dice.,00:18:45.830,00:18:50.630
"If you get a 7 or an 11, the
roller, we'll call that the",00:18:50.630,00:18:55.840
"shooter, you win.",00:18:55.840,00:19:01.490
"If you get a 2, 3, or
a 12, you lose.",00:19:01.490,00:19:08.870
"I'm assuming here, you're
betting what's",00:19:08.870,00:19:10.720
called the pass line.,00:19:10.720,00:19:12.690
"There are different ways to bet,
this is the most common",00:19:12.690,00:19:14.720
"way to bet, we'll just
deal with that.",00:19:14.720,00:19:17.820
"If it's not any of these, what
you get is, otherwise, the",00:19:17.820,00:19:27.150
"number becomes what's
called the point.",00:19:27.150,00:19:37.330
"Once you've got the point, you
keep rolling the dice until 1",00:19:37.330,00:19:41.470
of o things happens.,00:19:41.470,00:19:44.540
"You get a 7, in which case you
lose, or you get the point, in",00:19:44.540,00:19:56.430
which case you win.,00:19:56.430,00:20:04.250
So it's a pretty simple game.,00:20:04.250,00:20:07.420
Very popular game.,00:20:07.420,00:20:12.740
So I've implemented.,00:20:12.740,00:20:14.430
"So one of the interesting things
about this is, if you",00:20:14.430,00:20:18.400
"try and actually figure out
what the probabilities are",00:20:18.400,00:20:22.160
"using pencil and paper,
you can, but it gets",00:20:22.160,00:20:25.700
a little bit involved.,00:20:25.700,00:20:33.670
"Gets involved because you have
to, all right, what are the",00:20:33.670,00:20:35.960
"odds of winning or losing
on the first throw?",00:20:35.960,00:20:38.890
"Well, you can compute those
pretty easily, and you can see",00:20:38.890,00:20:41.160
"that you'd actually win
more than you lose,",00:20:41.160,00:20:43.550
on the first throw.,00:20:43.550,00:20:44.920
"But if you look at the
distribution of 7s and 11s and",00:20:44.920,00:20:48.030
"2s, 3s, and 12s, you add them
up, you'll see, well, this is",00:20:48.030,00:20:51.690
more likely than this.,00:20:51.690,00:20:53.890
"But then you say, suppose
I don't get those.",00:20:53.890,00:20:55.900
"What's the likelihood of getting
each other possible",00:20:55.900,00:20:58.610
"point value, and then given that
point value, what's the",00:20:58.610,00:21:02.070
"likelihood of getting
that before a 7?",00:21:02.070,00:21:04.900
"And you can do it, but
it gets very tedious.",00:21:04.900,00:21:07.720
"So those of us who are
inclined to think",00:21:07.720,00:21:11.450
"computationally, and I hope by
now that's all of you as well",00:21:11.450,00:21:15.430
"as me, say well, instead of
doing the probabilities by",00:21:15.430,00:21:19.270
"hand, I'm just going to write
a little program.",00:21:19.270,00:21:22.420
"And it's a program that took me
maybe 10 minutes to write.",00:21:22.420,00:21:27.330
"You can see it's quite small,
I did it yesterday.",00:21:27.330,00:21:34.240
"So the first function here is
craps, it returns true if the",00:21:34.240,00:21:39.620
"shooter wins by betting
the pass line.",00:21:39.620,00:21:43.350
"And it's just does
what I said.",00:21:43.350,00:21:46.380
"Rolls them, if the total
is 1 or 11, it",00:21:46.380,00:21:48.860
"returns true, you win.",00:21:48.860,00:21:51.270
"If it's 2, 3, or 12, it returns
false, you lose.",00:21:51.270,00:21:54.750
"Otherwise the point
becomes the total.",00:21:54.750,00:21:58.190
"And then while true, I'll
just keep rolling.",00:21:58.190,00:22:01.830
"Until either, if the total gets
the point, I return true.",00:22:01.830,00:22:07.290
"Or if the total's equal
7, I return false.",00:22:07.290,00:22:09.930
And that's it.,00:22:09.930,00:22:12.110
"So essentially I just took these
rules, typed them down,",00:22:12.110,00:22:15.590
and I had my game.,00:22:15.590,00:22:20.270
"And then I'll simulate it will
some number of bets.",00:22:20.270,00:22:24.620
"Keeping track of the numbers
of wins and losses.",00:22:24.620,00:22:28.980
"Just by incrementing 1 or the
other, depending upon whether",00:22:28.980,00:22:31.950
I return true or false.,00:22:31.950,00:22:34.500
"I'm going to, just to show what
we do, print the number",00:22:34.500,00:22:37.220
of wins and losses.,00:22:37.220,00:22:39.410
"And then compute, how
does the house do?",00:22:39.410,00:22:44.210
"Not the gambler, but the person
who's running the game,",00:22:44.210,00:22:48.120
the casino.,00:22:48.120,00:22:49.610
"Or in other circumstances,
other places.",00:22:49.610,00:22:53.720
"And then we'll see
how that goes.",00:22:53.720,00:22:56.910
"And I'll try it with
100,000 games.",00:22:56.910,00:23:00.570
"Now, this is more than 100,000
rolls of the dice, right?",00:23:00.570,00:23:03.940
"Because I don't get a 7
or 11, I keep rolling.",00:23:03.940,00:23:08.730
"So before I do it, I'll as the
easy question first. Who",00:23:08.730,00:23:15.790
"thinks the casino wins more
often than the player?",00:23:15.790,00:23:21.990
"Who thinks the player wins more
often than the casino?",00:23:21.990,00:23:26.150
"Well, very logical, casinos are
not in business of giving",00:23:26.150,00:23:30.090
away money.,00:23:30.090,00:23:32.870
"So now the more interesting
question.",00:23:32.870,00:23:34.800
"How steep do you think the odds
are in the house's favor?",00:23:34.800,00:23:38.770
Anyone want to guess?,00:23:38.770,00:23:43.980
Actually pretty thin.,00:23:43.980,00:23:45.040
Let's run it and see.,00:23:45.040,00:23:57.850
"So what we see is, the house
wins 50, in this case 50.424%",00:23:57.850,00:24:02.800
of the time.,00:24:02.800,00:24:04.770
Not a lot.,00:24:04.770,00:24:06.360
"On the other hand, if
people bet 100,000,",00:24:06.360,00:24:08.570
the house wins 848.,00:24:08.570,00:24:14.200
"Now, 100,000 is actually
a small number.",00:24:14.200,00:24:23.010
"Let's get rid of these, should
have gotten rid of these",00:24:23.010,00:24:25.780
"figures, you don't need to
see them every time.",00:24:25.780,00:24:53.560
"We'll keep one figure,
just for fun.",00:24:53.560,00:24:58.240
Let's try it again.,00:24:58.240,00:25:04.850
"Probably get a little
different answer.",00:25:04.850,00:25:06.300
"Considerable different, but
still, less than 51% of the",00:25:06.300,00:25:11.650
time in this trial.,00:25:11.650,00:25:13.270
"But you can see that the house
is slowly but surely going to",00:25:13.270,00:25:16.070
get rich playing this game.,00:25:16.070,00:25:20.570
"Now let's ask the other
interesting question.",00:25:20.570,00:25:24.650
"Just for fun, suppose
we want to cheat.",00:25:24.650,00:25:29.330
"Now, I realize none of you
would never do that.",00:25:29.330,00:25:32.670
"But let's consider using
a pair of loaded dice.",00:25:32.670,00:25:36.750
"So there's a long history, well
you can imagine when you",00:25:36.750,00:25:39.870
"looked at that old bone I showed
you, that it wasn't",00:25:39.870,00:25:43.480
exactly fair.,00:25:43.480,00:25:44.960
"That some sides were a little
heavier than others, and in",00:25:44.960,00:25:47.940
"fact you didn't get, say, a
5 exactly 1/6 of the time.",00:25:47.940,00:25:52.970
"And therefore, if you were using
your own dice, instead",00:25:52.970,00:25:55.430
"of somebody else's, and you knew
what was most likely, you",00:25:55.430,00:25:57.950
might do better.,00:25:57.950,00:26:00.070
"Well, the modern version of that
is, people do cheat by",00:26:00.070,00:26:02.560
"putting little weights in
dice, to just make tiny",00:26:02.560,00:26:06.430
"changes in the probability
of one number or",00:26:06.430,00:26:09.210
another coming up.,00:26:09.210,00:26:11.240
So let's do that.,00:26:11.240,00:26:14.570
"And let's first ask the
question, well, what would be",00:26:14.570,00:26:16.560
a nice way to do that?,00:26:16.560,00:26:20.250
It's very easy here.,00:26:20.250,00:26:24.540
"If we look at it, all I've
done is, I've changed the",00:26:24.540,00:26:37.290
"distribution of values, so
instead of here being 1, 2, 3,",00:26:37.290,00:26:41.210
"4, 5, and 6, it's 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 5, and 6.",00:26:41.210,00:26:46.270
"I snuck in an extra 5 on
one of the two dice.",00:26:46.270,00:26:51.520
"So this has changed the odds of
rolling a 5 from 1 in 6 to",00:26:51.520,00:26:59.300
roughly 3 in 12.,00:26:59.300,00:27:04.150
"Now 1/6, which is 2/12, vs.
3/12, it's not a big",00:27:04.150,00:27:09.510
difference.,00:27:09.510,00:27:10.790
"And you can imagine, if you were
sitting there watching",00:27:10.790,00:27:12.950
"it, you wouldn't notice that 5
was coming up a little bit",00:27:12.950,00:27:17.130
more often than you expected.,00:27:17.130,00:27:19.830
Normally.,00:27:19.830,00:27:21.150
"Close enough that you
wouldn't notice it.",00:27:21.150,00:27:23.750
"But let's see if, what
difference it makes?",00:27:23.750,00:27:28.800
"What difference do you think
it will make here?",00:27:28.800,00:27:30.590
"First of all, is it going
to be better or",00:27:30.590,00:27:32.840
worse for the player?,00:27:32.840,00:27:36.110
Who thinks better?,00:27:36.110,00:27:39.830
Who thinks worse?,00:27:39.830,00:27:42.500
"Who thinks they haven't
a clue?",00:27:42.500,00:27:45.650
"All right, we have
an honest man.",00:27:45.650,00:27:48.640
"Where is Diogenes when
we we need him?",00:27:48.640,00:27:52.130
The reward for honesty.,00:27:52.130,00:27:55.650
"I could reward you and wake
him up at the same time.",00:27:55.650,00:27:58.030
It's good.,00:27:58.030,00:28:01.340
"All right, well, let's
see what happens.",00:28:01.340,00:28:16.810
"All right, so suddenly, the odds
have swung in favor of",00:28:16.810,00:28:21.095
the player.,00:28:21.095,00:28:23.090
"This tiny little change has now
made it likely that the",00:28:23.090,00:28:28.030
"player win money, instead
of the house.",00:28:28.030,00:28:33.440
So what's the point?,00:28:33.440,00:28:34.300
"The point is not, you should
go out and try and cheat",00:28:34.300,00:28:36.730

looking at in this study, who",00:43:30.500,00:43:34.390
"took the therapy, and who had a
heart disease, each of those",00:43:34.390,00:43:39.180
"was correlated with the
lurking variable of",00:43:39.180,00:43:42.320
socioeconomic position.,00:43:42.320,00:43:46.680
"And so, in effect, there
was no cause and effect",00:43:46.680,00:43:49.960
relationship.,00:43:49.960,00:43:51.370
"And once they did another study,
in which the lurking",00:43:51.370,00:43:54.990
"variable was controlled, and
they looked at heart disease",00:43:54.990,00:43:59.400
"among rich women separately
from poor women, with this",00:43:59.400,00:44:02.620
"therapy, they discovered that
therapy was not good.",00:44:02.620,00:44:07.060
"It was, in fact, harmful.",00:44:07.060,00:44:10.700
"So this is a very important
moral to remember.",00:44:10.700,00:44:16.290
"When you look at correlations,
don't assume cause and effect.",00:44:16.290,00:44:21.790
"And don't assume that there
isn't a lurking variable that",00:44:21.790,00:44:25.540
really is the dominant factor.,00:44:25.540,00:44:29.940
"So that's one statistical, a
second statistical worry.",00:44:29.940,00:44:35.310
"Number 2 is, beware of what's
called, non-response bias.",00:44:35.310,00:44:48.260
"Which is another fancy
way of saying,",00:44:48.260,00:44:51.030
non-representative samples.,00:44:51.030,00:45:05.120
"No one doing a study beyond
the trivial can sample",00:45:05.120,00:45:08.130
everybody or everything.,00:45:08.130,00:45:11.590
"And only mind readers can be
sure of what they've missed.",00:45:11.590,00:45:17.080
"Unless, of course,
people choose to",00:45:17.080,00:45:18.640
miss things on purpose.,00:45:18.640,00:45:20.600
Which you also see.,00:45:20.600,00:45:22.030
"And that brings me to
my next anecdote.",00:45:22.030,00:45:24.720
"A former professor at the
University of Nebraska, who",00:45:24.720,00:45:31.240
"later headed a group called The
Family Research Institute,",00:45:31.240,00:45:34.300
"which some of you may have heard
about, claimed that gay",00:45:34.300,00:45:37.340
"men have an average life
expectancy of 43 years.",00:45:37.340,00:45:43.610
"And they did a study full of
statistics showing that this",00:45:43.610,00:45:46.570
was the case.,00:45:46.570,00:45:49.550
"And the key was, they calculated
the figure by",00:45:49.550,00:45:53.690
"checking gay newspapers for
obituaries and news about",00:45:53.690,00:45:58.160
stories of death.,00:45:58.160,00:46:00.170
"So they went through the gay
newspapers, took a list of",00:46:00.170,00:46:04.410
"everybody whose obituary
appeared, how old they were",00:46:04.410,00:46:08.190
"when they died, took the
average, and said it was 43.",00:46:08.190,00:46:13.080
"Then they did a bunch of
statistics, with all sorts of",00:46:13.080,00:46:15.430
"tests, showing how, you know,
what the curves look like, the",00:46:15.430,00:46:19.190
"distributions, and
the significance.",00:46:19.190,00:46:21.310
All the math was valid.,00:46:21.310,00:46:25.130
"The problem was, it was a very
unrepresentative sample.",00:46:25.130,00:46:28.890
What was the most,00:46:28.890,00:46:29.680
"unrepresentative
thing about it?",00:46:29.680,00:46:32.990
Somebody?,00:46:32.990,00:46:33.480
"STUDENT: Not all deaths
have obituaries.",00:46:33.480,00:46:38.595
"PROFESSOR: Well, that's
one thing.",00:46:38.595,00:46:40.930
That's certainly true.,00:46:40.930,00:46:41.820
But what else?,00:46:41.820,00:46:44.420
"Well, not all gay people
are dead, right?",00:46:44.420,00:46:48.170
"So if you're looking at
obituaries, you're in fact",00:46:48.170,00:46:51.370
only getting --,00:46:51.370,00:46:52.690
"I'm sure that's what you were
planning to say -- sorry.",00:46:52.690,00:46:56.310
"You're only getting the people
who are dead, so it's clearly",00:46:56.310,00:46:59.400
"going to make the number
look smaller, right?",00:46:59.400,00:47:02.970
"Furthermore, you're only getting
the ones that were",00:47:02.970,00:47:05.460
"reported in newspapers, the
newspapers are typically",00:47:05.460,00:47:09.720
"urban, rather than out in rural
areas, so it turns out,",00:47:09.720,00:47:17.140
"it's also biased against gays
who chose not come out of the",00:47:17.140,00:47:22.230
"closet, and therefore didn't
appear in these.",00:47:22.230,00:47:26.400
"Lots and lots of things
with the problems.",00:47:26.400,00:47:29.410
"Believe it or not, this
paper was published",00:47:29.410,00:47:31.260
in a reputable journal.,00:47:31.260,00:47:34.040
"And someone checked all the
math, but missed the fact that",00:47:34.040,00:47:38.330
"all of that was irrelevant
because the sample was wrong.",00:47:38.330,00:47:49.100
Data enhancement.,00:47:49.100,00:47:50.790
"It even sounds bad, right?",00:47:50.790,00:47:53.500
"You run an experiment, you get
your data, and you enhance it.",00:47:53.500,00:47:56.820
"It's kind of like when you ran
those physics experiments in",00:47:56.820,00:47:59.460
"high school, and you've got
answers that you knew didn't",00:47:59.460,00:48:02.640
"match the theory, so you
fudged the data?",00:48:02.640,00:48:05.340
"I know none of you would have
ever done that, but some",00:48:05.340,00:48:08.910
people been known to do.,00:48:08.910,00:48:09.850
"That's not actually
what this means.",00:48:09.850,00:48:12.380
"What this means is, reading
more into the data than it",00:48:12.380,00:48:16.260
actually implies.,00:48:16.260,00:48:19.390
"So well-meaning people are
often the guiltiest here.",00:48:19.390,00:48:23.410
"So here's another one
of my favorites.",00:48:23.410,00:48:26.010
"For example, there are people
who try to scare us into",00:48:26.010,00:48:29.730
driving safely.,00:48:29.730,00:48:31.330
"Driving safely is
a good thing.",00:48:31.330,00:48:33.920
By telling holiday deaths.,00:48:33.920,00:48:36.280
"So you'll read things like,
400 killed on the highways",00:48:36.280,00:48:39.790
over long weekend.,00:48:39.790,00:48:42.240
"It sounds really bad, until
you observe the fact that",00:48:42.240,00:48:46.600
"roughly 400 people are killed
on any 3-day period.",00:48:46.600,00:48:51.940
"And in fact, it's no higher
on the holiday weekends.",00:48:51.940,00:48:56.790
"I'll bet you all thought
more people got",00:48:56.790,00:48:58.360
killed on holiday weekends.,00:48:58.360,00:48:59.580
"Well, typically not.",00:48:59.580,00:49:02.330
"They just report how many died,
but they don't tell you",00:49:02.330,00:49:05.210
"the context, say, oh, by the
way, take any 3-day period.",00:49:05.210,00:49:12.440
"So the moral there is, you
really want to place the data",00:49:12.440,00:49:17.260
in context.,00:49:17.260,00:49:20.250
"Data taken out of context
without comparison is usually",00:49:20.250,00:49:25.530
meaningless.,00:49:25.530,00:49:27.460
"Another variance of this
is extrapolation.",00:49:27.460,00:49:39.540
A commonly quoted statistic.,00:49:39.540,00:49:42.150
"Most auto accidents happen
within 10 miles of home.",00:49:42.150,00:49:45.300
"Anyone here heard
that statistic?",00:49:45.300,00:49:48.750
"It's true, but what
does it mean?",00:49:48.750,00:49:53.080
"Well, people tend to say it
means, it's dangerous to drive",00:49:53.080,00:49:55.730
when you're near home.,00:49:55.730,00:49:57.620
"But in fact, most driving is
done within 10 miles of home.",00:49:57.620,00:50:02.430
"Furthermore, we don't actually
know where home is.",00:50:02.430,00:50:06.090
"Home is where the car is
supposedly garaged on the",00:50:06.090,00:50:09.370
"state registration forms. So,
data enhancements would",00:50:09.370,00:50:14.800
"suggest that I should register
my car in Alaska.",00:50:14.800,00:50:18.650
"And then I would never be
driving within 10 miles of",00:50:18.650,00:50:20.980
"home, and I would
be much safer.",00:50:20.980,00:50:24.100
"Well, it's probably
not a fact.",00:50:24.100,00:50:32.330
"So there are all sorts
of things on that.",00:50:32.330,00:50:37.020
"Well, I think I will come back
to this, because I have a",00:50:37.020,00:50:39.090
"couple more good stories which
I hate not to give you.",00:50:39.090,00:50:42.090

and look at a couple of more",00:50:42.090,00:50:45.750

with statistics.",00:50:45.750,00:50:48.180
