"PROFESSOR: Today we're going to
continue our discussion of",00:00:23.170,00:00:28.900
methods of integration.,00:00:28.900,00:00:33.040
"The method that I'm going to
describe today handles a whole",00:00:33.040,00:00:36.550
"class of functions of
the following form.",00:00:36.550,00:00:40.510
"You take P (x) / Q (x)
and this is known",00:00:40.510,00:00:45.870
as a rational function.,00:00:45.870,00:00:53.460
"And all that means is that
it's a ratio off two",00:00:53.460,00:01:01.090
"polynomials, which are these
functions P ( x) and Q ( x).",00:01:01.090,00:01:13.300
"We'll handle all such functions
by a method which is",00:01:13.300,00:01:17.560
known as partial fractions.,00:01:17.560,00:01:26.250
"And what this does is, it splits
P / Q into what you",00:01:26.250,00:01:36.300
could call easier pieces.,00:01:36.300,00:01:45.260
"So that's going to be some
kind of algebra.",00:01:45.260,00:01:48.030
"And that's what we're going
to spend most of",00:01:48.030,00:01:49.380
our time doing today.,00:01:49.380,00:01:52.640
I'll start with an example.,00:01:52.640,00:01:55.090
"And all of my examples
will be illustrating",00:01:55.090,00:01:58.950
more general methods.,00:01:58.950,00:02:01.830
"The example is to integrate the
function 1 / x - 1 +, say,",00:02:01.830,00:02:08.200
3 / x + 2 dx.,00:02:08.200,00:02:15.240
That's easy to do.,00:02:15.240,00:02:17.400
"It's just, we already
know the answer.",00:02:17.400,00:02:19.410
It's ln x - 1 + 3 ln x + 3.,00:02:19.410,00:02:26.780
Plus a constant.,00:02:26.780,00:02:28.340
So that's done.,00:02:28.340,00:02:37.050
"So now, here's the difficulty
that is going to arise.",00:02:37.050,00:02:41.330
"The difficulty is that I can
start with this function,",00:02:41.330,00:02:45.070
which is perfectly manageable.,00:02:45.070,00:02:49.210
"And than I can add these
two functions together.",00:02:49.210,00:02:52.830
The way I add fractions.,00:02:52.830,00:02:55.380
"So that's getting a common
denominator.",00:02:55.380,00:03:00.750
"And so that gives me x +
2 here + 3 ( x - 1).",00:03:00.750,00:03:06.645
"And now if I combine together
all of these terms, then",00:03:06.645,00:03:11.550
"altogether I have 4x +
2 - 3, that's - 1.",00:03:11.550,00:03:16.960
"And if I multiply out the
denominator that's x ^2 + that",00:03:16.960,00:03:23.690
"2 turned into a 3, that's
interesting.",00:03:23.690,00:03:28.060
"Hope there aren't too many more
of those transformations.",00:03:28.060,00:03:31.240
Is there another one here?,00:03:31.240,00:03:32.570
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:03:32.570,00:03:36.830
"PROFESSOR: Oh, it happened
earlier on.",00:03:36.830,00:03:39.150
"Wow that's an interesting
vibration there.",00:03:39.150,00:03:42.620
OK.,00:03:42.620,00:03:45.510
Thank you.,00:03:45.510,00:03:50.500
"So, I guess my 3's were
speaking to my 2's.",00:03:50.500,00:03:56.770
"Somewhere in my past.
OK, anyway, I",00:03:56.770,00:04:00.610
think this is now correct.,00:04:00.610,00:04:07.200
"So the problem is
the following.",00:04:07.200,00:04:10.020
This is the problem with this.,00:04:10.020,00:04:11.450
This integral was easy.,00:04:11.450,00:04:14.830
"I'm calling it easy, we already
know how to do it.",00:04:14.830,00:04:18.500
Over here.,00:04:18.500,00:04:19.450
"But now over here,
it's disguised.",00:04:19.450,00:04:28.040
"It's the same function, but it's
no longer clear how to",00:04:28.040,00:04:32.270
integrate it.,00:04:32.270,00:04:32.780
"If you're faced with this
one, you say what am",00:04:32.780,00:04:34.990
I supposed to do.,00:04:34.990,00:04:38.480
"And we have to get around
that difficulty.",00:04:38.480,00:04:41.790
"And so what we're going
to do is we're going",00:04:41.790,00:04:44.205
to unwind this disguise.,00:04:44.205,00:04:46.660
"So we have the algebra problem
that we have. Oh, wow.",00:04:46.660,00:04:57.950
"There must be something
in the water.",00:04:57.950,00:04:59.510
Impressive.,00:04:59.510,00:05:06.280
Wow.,00:05:06.280,00:05:06.920
"OK, let's see.",00:05:06.920,00:05:08.350
Is 2/3 = 3/2?,00:05:08.350,00:05:14.660
Holy cow.,00:05:14.660,00:05:17.960
Well that's good.,00:05:17.960,00:05:18.760
"Well, I'll keep you awake
today with several other",00:05:18.760,00:05:21.340
transpositions here.,00:05:21.340,00:05:23.940
"So our algebra problem is to
detect the easy pieces which",00:05:23.940,00:05:30.760
are inside.,00:05:30.760,00:05:36.290
"And the method that we're going
to use, the one that",00:05:36.290,00:05:38.850
"we'll emphasize anyway, is one
algebraic trick which is a",00:05:38.850,00:05:43.880
"shortcut, which is called
the cover-up method.",00:05:43.880,00:05:49.320
"But we're going to talk
about even more",00:05:49.320,00:05:51.170
general things than that.,00:05:51.170,00:05:52.510
"But anyway, this is where
we're headed.",00:05:52.510,00:05:54.300
"Is something called the
cover-up method.",00:05:54.300,00:05:57.910
Alright.,00:05:57.910,00:05:59.490
So that's our intro.,00:05:59.490,00:06:02.640
"And I'll just have to remember
that 2 is not 3.",00:06:02.640,00:06:05.765
I'll keep on repeating that.,00:06:05.765,00:06:08.130
"So now here I'm going to
describe to you how we unwind",00:06:08.130,00:06:12.240
this disguise.,00:06:12.240,00:06:13.880
"The first step is,
we write down the",00:06:13.880,00:06:16.990
function we want to integrate.,00:06:16.990,00:06:18.690
Which was this.,00:06:18.690,00:06:21.890
"And now we have to undo the
first damage that we did.",00:06:21.890,00:06:26.310
"So the first step is to factor
the denominator.",00:06:26.310,00:06:31.930
"And that factors, we happen to
know the factors, so I'm not",00:06:31.930,00:06:34.580
going to carry this out.,00:06:34.580,00:06:36.150
"But this can be a rather
difficult step.",00:06:36.150,00:06:38.510
"But we're going to assume
that it's done.",00:06:38.510,00:06:41.110
"For the purposes of
illustration here.",00:06:41.110,00:06:44.030
So I factor the denominator.,00:06:44.030,00:06:46.780
"And now, the second thing that
I'm going to do is what I'm",00:06:46.780,00:06:51.730
going to call the setup here.,00:06:51.730,00:06:54.770
"How I'm going to
set things up.",00:06:54.770,00:06:56.520
"And I'll tell you what these
things are more systematically",00:06:56.520,00:07:00.100
in a second.,00:07:00.100,00:07:01.010
"And the setup is that
I want to somehow",00:07:01.010,00:07:03.210
detect what I did before.,00:07:03.210,00:07:05.240
"And I'm going to write
some unknowns here.",00:07:05.240,00:07:11.880
"What I expect is that this will
break up into two pieces.",00:07:11.880,00:07:15.650
"One with the denominator x -
1, and the other with the",00:07:15.650,00:07:18.060
denominator x + 2.,00:07:18.060,00:07:23.470
"So now, my third step is going
to be to solve for A and B.",00:07:23.470,00:07:32.860
"And then I'm done,
if I do that.",00:07:32.860,00:07:34.500
"That's the complete unwinding
of this disguise.",00:07:34.500,00:07:41.370
"And this is where the cover-up
method comes in handy.",00:07:41.370,00:07:43.940
"This is this method that
I'm about to describe.",00:07:43.940,00:07:46.800
"Now, you can do the algebra in a
clumsy way, or you can do it",00:07:46.800,00:07:49.920
in a quick way.,00:07:49.920,00:07:50.970
"And we'd like to get efficient
about the algebra involved.",00:07:50.970,00:07:54.240
"And so let me show you
what the first step",00:07:54.240,00:07:57.450
in the trick is.,00:07:57.450,00:07:58.590
"We're going to solve for A by
multiplying by (x - 1).",00:07:58.590,00:08:12.470
"Now, notice if you multiply by
(x - 1) in that equation 2,",00:08:12.470,00:08:16.080
what you get is this.,00:08:16.080,00:08:16.920
"You got 4x - 2 / the
x - 1's cancel.",00:08:16.920,00:08:21.840
"You get this on the
left-hand side.",00:08:21.840,00:08:23.920
"And on the right-hand side
you get A. The x",00:08:23.920,00:08:27.870
- 1's cancel again.,00:08:27.870,00:08:29.620
"And then we get this
extra term.",00:08:29.620,00:08:31.420
Which is B/ ( x + 2)( x - 1).,00:08:31.420,00:08:35.200
"Now, the trick here, and we're
going to get even better trick",00:08:35.200,00:08:39.200
in just a second.,00:08:39.200,00:08:40.370
"The trick here is that I
didn't try to clear the",00:08:40.370,00:08:42.970
denominators completely.,00:08:42.970,00:08:44.560
"I was very efficient about
the way I did it.",00:08:44.560,00:08:46.820
It just cleared one factor.,00:08:46.820,00:08:51.390
"And the result here
is very useful.",00:08:51.390,00:08:54.780
"Namely, if I plug in now x =
1, this term drops out too.",00:08:54.780,00:09:03.480
"So what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to plug in x = 1.",00:09:03.480,00:09:10.560
"And what I get on the left-hand
side here is 4 - 1",00:09:10.560,00:09:13.970
"and 1 + 2, and on the
left-hand side I get",00:09:13.970,00:09:16.550
A. That's the end.,00:09:16.550,00:09:19.740
"This is my formula for A. A
happens to be equal to 1.",00:09:19.740,00:09:27.150
"And that's, of course,
what I expect.",00:09:27.150,00:09:29.100
"A had better be 1, because the
thing broke up into 1 / x - 1",00:09:29.100,00:09:33.340
+ 3 / x + 2.,00:09:33.340,00:09:37.100
So this is the correct answer.,00:09:37.100,00:09:39.900
"There was a question out
here, which I missed.",00:09:39.900,00:09:41.610
"STUDENT: Aren't polynomials
defined as functions with",00:09:41.610,00:09:48.560
"whole powers, or could
they be square roots?",00:09:48.560,00:09:56.210
"PROFESSOR: Are polynomials
defined as functions with",00:09:56.210,00:09:58.300
"whole powers, or can they
be square roots?",00:09:58.300,00:10:00.330
That's the question.,00:10:00.330,00:10:01.350
"The answer is, they only
have whole powers.",00:10:01.350,00:10:04.140
"So for instance here I only
have the power 1 and 0.",00:10:04.140,00:10:06.950
"Here I have the powers 2, 1
and 0 in the denominator.",00:10:06.950,00:10:10.410
"Square roots are no good
for this method.",00:10:10.410,00:10:16.890
Another question.,00:10:16.890,00:10:17.670
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:10:17.670,00:10:18.620
"PROFESSOR: Why did
I say x = 1?",00:10:18.620,00:10:22.260
"The reason why I said x = 1 was
that it works really fast.",00:10:22.260,00:10:26.650
"You can't know this in advance,",00:10:26.650,00:10:27.910
that's part of the method.,00:10:27.910,00:10:30.400
"It just turns out to be
the best thing to do.",00:10:30.400,00:10:32.810
"The fastest way of getting at
the coefficient A. Now the",00:10:32.810,00:10:36.360
"curious thing, let me
just pause for a",00:10:36.360,00:10:38.210
second before I do it.,00:10:38.210,00:10:39.320
"If I had plugged x = 1 into the
original equation, I would",00:10:39.320,00:10:44.010
have gotten nonsense.,00:10:44.010,00:10:45.070
"Because I would've gotten
0 in the denominator.",00:10:45.070,00:10:48.210
"And that seems like the most
horrible thing to do.",00:10:48.210,00:10:50.940
"The worst possible thing
to do, is to set x = 1.",00:10:50.940,00:10:54.280
"On the other hand, what
we did is a trick.",00:10:54.280,00:10:56.490
We multiplied by x - 1.,00:10:56.490,00:10:58.870
"And that turned the equation
into this.",00:10:58.870,00:11:01.100
"So now, in disguise,
I multiplied by 0.",00:11:01.100,00:11:05.810
"But that turns out
to be legitimate.",00:11:05.810,00:11:07.890
"Because really this equation
is true for all x except 1.",00:11:07.890,00:11:11.770
"And then instead of taking
x = 1, I can really",00:11:11.770,00:11:13.880
take x tends to 1.,00:11:13.880,00:11:15.580
That's really what I need.,00:11:15.580,00:11:17.200
The limit is x goes to one.,00:11:17.200,00:11:18.530
"The equation is still
valid then.",00:11:18.530,00:11:20.610
"So I'm using the worst case, the
case that looks like it's",00:11:20.610,00:11:23.220
dividing by 0.,00:11:23.220,00:11:24.360
"And it's helping me because it's
cancelling out all the",00:11:24.360,00:11:26.870
"information in terms of B. So
the advantage here is this",00:11:26.870,00:11:31.730
"cancellation that occurs
in this part.",00:11:31.730,00:11:36.090
So that's the method.,00:11:36.090,00:11:37.440
"We're going to shorten it much,
much more in a second.",00:11:37.440,00:11:39.930
"But let me carry it out for the
other coefficient as well.",00:11:39.930,00:11:44.640
"So the other coefficient I'm
going to solve for B, I'm",00:11:44.640,00:11:51.700
going to multiply by x + 2.,00:11:51.700,00:11:57.490
"And when I do that, I get 4x
- 1 / x - 1, that's the",00:11:57.490,00:12:01.620
"left-hand side, the very
top expression there.",00:12:01.620,00:12:05.020
"And then down below I get
A/ ( x - 1)( x + 2).",00:12:05.020,00:12:10.700
"And then again the
x + 2's cancel.",00:12:10.700,00:12:14.380
So I get B sitting alone.,00:12:14.380,00:12:15.960
"And now I'm going to
do the same trick.",00:12:15.960,00:12:18.150
I'm going to set x = - 2.,00:12:18.150,00:12:21.540
"That's the value which
is going to knock",00:12:21.540,00:12:27.270
out this A term here.,00:12:27.270,00:12:28.530
"So that cancels this
term completely.",00:12:28.530,00:12:30.770
"And what we get here all told
is - 8 - 1 / - 2 - 1 = B. In",00:12:30.770,00:12:37.950
"other words, B = 3, which
was also what it",00:12:37.950,00:12:43.090
was supposed to be.,00:12:43.090,00:12:44.100
"B was this number
3, right here.",00:12:44.100,00:12:48.460
"Which I'm now not going
to change to 2.",00:12:48.460,00:12:50.820
"Because I know that
it's not 2.",00:12:50.820,00:12:52.600
There was a question.,00:12:52.600,00:12:53.370
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:12:53.370,00:12:59.540
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:12:59.540,00:13:01.420
"Now, this is the method which
is called cover-up.",00:13:01.420,00:13:05.770
"But it's really carried out
much, much faster than this.",00:13:05.770,00:13:09.490
"So I'm going to review the
method and I'm going to show",00:13:09.490,00:13:11.880
you what it is in general.,00:13:11.880,00:13:14.300
"So the first step is to factor
the denominator, Q. That's",00:13:14.300,00:13:23.030
what I labeled 1 over there.,00:13:23.030,00:13:24.590
"That was the factorization of
the denominator up top.",00:13:24.590,00:13:29.350
"The second step is what I'm
going to call the setup.",00:13:29.350,00:13:36.260
That's step 2.,00:13:36.260,00:13:37.250
"And that's where I knew what I
was aiming for in advance.",00:13:37.250,00:13:41.060
"And I'm going to have to
explain to you in every",00:13:41.060,00:13:42.990
"instance exactly what this
setup should be.",00:13:42.990,00:13:45.780
"That is, what the unknowns
should be and what target,",00:13:45.780,00:13:49.070
"simplified expression,
we're aiming for.",00:13:49.070,00:13:53.080
So that's the setup.,00:13:53.080,00:13:54.950
"And then the third step is what
I'll now call cover-up.",00:13:54.950,00:14:01.010
"Which is just a very fast way
of doing what I did on this",00:14:01.010,00:14:04.300
"last board, which is solving for
the unknown coefficients.",00:14:04.300,00:14:09.470
"So now, let me perform
it for you again.",00:14:09.470,00:14:12.890
Over here.,00:14:12.890,00:14:14.170
"So it's 4x - 1 divided
by, so this is to",00:14:14.170,00:14:17.750
eliminate writing here.,00:14:17.750,00:14:19.650
"Handwriting it makes
it much faster.",00:14:19.650,00:14:24.130
"So this part just factoring the
denominator, that was 1,",00:14:24.130,00:14:29.920
that was step 1.,00:14:29.920,00:14:31.290
"And then step 2, again,
is the setup, which is",00:14:31.290,00:14:34.320
setting it up like this.,00:14:34.320,00:14:39.700
"Alright, that's the setup.",00:14:39.700,00:14:42.580
"And now I claim that without
writing very much, I can",00:14:42.580,00:14:46.540
figure out what A and B are.,00:14:46.540,00:14:49.350
Just by staring at this.,00:14:49.350,00:14:51.350
"So now what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to think what I",00:14:51.350,00:14:54.470
did over there.,00:14:54.470,00:14:55.720
"And I'm just going to
do it directly.",00:14:55.720,00:14:57.570
"So let me show you what the
method consists of visually.",00:14:57.570,00:15:02.680
"I'm going to cover up, that is,
knock out this factor, and",00:15:02.680,00:15:09.200
focus on this number here.,00:15:09.200,00:15:13.560
"And I'm going to plug in the
thing that makes the 0,",00:15:13.560,00:15:16.240
which is x = 1.,00:15:16.240,00:15:17.580
So I'm plugging in x = 1.,00:15:17.580,00:15:20.180
To this left-hand side.,00:15:20.180,00:15:21.670
"And what I get is 4 - 1 / 1 +
2 = A. Now, that's the same",00:15:21.670,00:15:29.040
thing I did over there.,00:15:29.040,00:15:29.820
"I just did it by skipping the
intermediate algebra step,",00:15:29.820,00:15:33.610
which is a lot of writing.,00:15:33.610,00:15:35.860
"So the cover-up method
really amounts to",00:15:35.860,00:15:37.940
the following thing.,00:15:37.940,00:15:38.580
"I'm thinking of multiplying
this over here.",00:15:38.580,00:15:40.385
"It cancels this and it gets
rid of everything else.",00:15:40.385,00:15:43.240
"And it just leaves me with
A on the right-hand side.",00:15:43.240,00:15:45.960
"And I have to get rid
of it on this side.",00:15:45.960,00:15:47.680
"So in other words, by
eliminating this, I'm",00:15:47.680,00:15:50.360
"isolating a on the
right-hand side.",00:15:50.360,00:15:53.090
"So the cover-up is that
I'm covering this and",00:15:53.090,00:15:55.860
getting A out of it.,00:15:55.860,00:15:57.670
"Similarly, I can do the same
thing with B. It's focused on",00:15:57.670,00:16:02.330
the value x = - 2.,00:16:02.330,00:16:04.720
"And b is what I'm getting
on the right-hand side.",00:16:04.720,00:16:07.010
"And then I have to
cover up this.",00:16:07.010,00:16:10.400
"So if I cover up that, then
what's left over with x = - 2",00:16:10.400,00:16:14.530
"is again, - 8 - 1 / - 2 - 1.",00:16:14.530,00:16:22.580
"So this is the way the method
gets carried out in practice.",00:16:22.580,00:16:26.970
"Writing, essentially,
the least you can.",00:16:26.970,00:16:32.070
"Now, when you get to several
variables, it becomes just way",00:16:32.070,00:16:40.140
more convenient to do this.,00:16:40.140,00:16:42.170
"So now, let me just review
when cover-up works.",00:16:42.170,00:16:45.660
"So this cover-up method
works if Q ( x) has",00:16:45.660,00:16:57.370
distinct linear factors.,00:16:57.370,00:17:06.060
"And, so you need two
things here.",00:17:06.060,00:17:11.780
"It has to factor completely, the
denominator has to factor",00:17:11.780,00:17:14.570
completely.,00:17:14.570,00:17:15.180
"And the degree of the numerator
has to be strictly",00:17:15.180,00:17:20.920
"less than the degree
of the denominator.",00:17:20.920,00:17:27.750
"I'm going to give you
an example here.",00:17:27.750,00:17:30.080
"So, for instance, and this tells
you the general pattern",00:17:30.080,00:17:36.010
of the setup also.,00:17:36.010,00:17:38.070
"Say you had x ^2 + 3x
+ 8, let's say.",00:17:38.070,00:17:44.090
Over (x - 1) ( x - 2)( x + 5).,00:17:44.090,00:17:50.380
"So here I'm going to
tell you the setup.",00:17:50.380,00:17:52.920
"The setup is going to be
A / (x - 1) + B / (x -",00:17:52.920,00:17:58.710
2) + c / x + 5.,00:17:58.710,00:18:02.820
"And it will always break
up into something.",00:18:02.820,00:18:04.620
"So however many factors you
have, you'll have to put in a",00:18:04.620,00:18:07.570
term for each of those.,00:18:07.570,00:18:09.770
"And then you can find
each number here by",00:18:09.770,00:18:13.300
this cover-up method.,00:18:13.300,00:18:26.060
Now we're done with that.,00:18:26.060,00:18:29.450
"And now we have to go on to the
algebraic complications.",00:18:29.450,00:18:33.280
"So would the first typical
algebraic complication be.",00:18:33.280,00:18:38.420
"It would be repeated roots
or repeated factors.",00:18:38.420,00:18:50.760
"Let me get one that doesn't
come out to be",00:18:50.760,00:18:54.190
extremely ugly here.,00:18:54.190,00:18:56.850
"So this is what we'll
call Example 2.",00:18:56.850,00:19:02.930
"And this is going to work when
the degree, you always need",00:19:02.930,00:19:06.510
"that the degree of the numerator
is less than the",00:19:06.510,00:19:08.650
degree of the denominator.,00:19:08.650,00:19:12.060
"And Q has now repeated
linear factors.",00:19:12.060,00:19:22.980
"So let's see which example
I wanted to show you.",00:19:22.980,00:19:26.030
So let's just give this here.,00:19:26.030,00:19:28.830
"I'll just repeat the
denominator.",00:19:28.830,00:19:34.080
"With an extra factor
like this.",00:19:34.080,00:19:39.580
"Now, the main thing you need
to know, since I've already",00:19:39.580,00:19:42.110
"performed the factorization
for you.",00:19:42.110,00:19:44.370
Already performed Step 1.,00:19:44.370,00:19:46.140
This is Step 1 here.,00:19:46.140,00:19:49.350
"You have to factor things all
the way, and that's already",00:19:49.350,00:19:51.540
been done for you.,00:19:51.540,00:19:53.910
And here's what this setup is.,00:19:53.910,00:19:56.840
"The setup is that it's of
the form A / (x - 1)",00:19:56.840,00:20:01.820
+ B / (x - 1) ^2.,00:20:01.820,00:20:05.540
"We need another term for the
square here. + C / (x + 2).",00:20:05.540,00:20:15.590
"In general, if you have more
powers you just need to keep",00:20:15.590,00:20:17.950
on putting in those powers.,00:20:17.950,00:20:19.310
"You need one for each
of the powers.",00:20:19.310,00:20:24.140
Why does it have to be squared?,00:20:24.140,00:20:26.340
OK.,00:20:26.340,00:20:27.570
Good question.,00:20:27.570,00:20:28.680
"So why in the world
am I doing this?",00:20:28.680,00:20:31.660
"Let me just give you one hint
as to why I'm doing this.",00:20:31.660,00:20:37.070
"It's very, very much like the
decimal expansion of a number",00:20:37.070,00:20:41.600
"or, say, the base 2 expansion
of a number.",00:20:41.600,00:20:44.820
"So, for, example the number 7/16
is 0 / 2 + 1 / 2 ^2 + 1/2",00:20:44.820,00:20:57.750
"^3 +, is that right?",00:20:57.750,00:21:02.120
So it's 4/16 + 1/2 ^4.,00:21:02.120,00:21:07.300
It's this sort of thing.,00:21:07.300,00:21:09.090
"And I'm getting this power
and this power.",00:21:09.090,00:21:11.880
"If I have higher powers,
I'm going to have to",00:21:11.880,00:21:13.760
have more and more.,00:21:13.760,00:21:14.500
"So this is what happens
when I have a 2 ^ 4.",00:21:14.500,00:21:17.310
"I have to represent
things like this.",00:21:17.310,00:21:20.550
"That's what's coming out
of this piece with the",00:21:20.550,00:21:23.840
repetitious here.,00:21:23.840,00:21:24.930
Of the powers.,00:21:24.930,00:21:26.390
This is just an analogy.,00:21:26.390,00:21:31.070
Of what we're doing.,00:21:31.070,00:21:31.930
"Yeah, another question
over here.",00:21:31.930,00:21:33.280
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:21:33.280,00:21:34.460
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:21:34.460,00:21:35.080
"So this is an example, but it's
meant to represent the",00:21:35.080,00:21:37.350
"general case and I will also
give you a general picture.",00:21:37.350,00:21:41.210
"For sure, once you have the
second power here, you'll need",00:21:41.210,00:21:43.820
"both the first and the second
power mentioned over here.",00:21:43.820,00:21:46.790
"And since there's only a first
power over here I only have to",00:21:46.790,00:21:48.960
"mention a first power
over there.",00:21:48.960,00:21:52.060
"If this were a 3 here, there
would be one more term which",00:21:52.060,00:21:55.790
"would be the one for x - 1
^2 in the denominator.",00:21:55.790,00:22:00.630
That's what you just said.,00:22:00.630,00:22:03.940
"OK, now, what's different about
this setup is that the",00:22:03.940,00:22:09.400
"cover-up method, although
it works, it",00:22:09.400,00:22:11.810
doesn't work so well.,00:22:11.810,00:22:13.120
It doesn't work quite as well.,00:22:13.120,00:22:14.660
"The cover-up works for the
coefficients B and C, not A.",00:22:14.660,00:22:33.940
"We'll have a quick method for
the numbers B and C. To figure",00:22:33.940,00:22:38.710
out what they are.,00:22:38.710,00:22:40.530
"But it will be a little slower
to get to A, which we will do",00:22:40.530,00:22:43.820
"last. Let me show you
how it works.",00:22:43.820,00:22:56.780
"First of all, I'm going to do
the ordinary cover-up with C.",00:22:56.780,00:23:01.610
"So for C, I just want
to do the same old",00:23:01.610,00:23:05.640
thing that I did before.,00:23:05.640,00:23:06.360
"I cover up this, and that's
going to get rid of all the",00:23:06.360,00:23:10.260
junk except for the C term.,00:23:10.260,00:23:12.300
So I have to plug x = - 2.,00:23:12.300,00:23:16.800
"And I get x -- sorry, I get (-2
) ^2 + 2 in the numerator.",00:23:16.800,00:23:21.810
"And I get (- 2 - 1)^2
in the denominator.",00:23:21.810,00:23:25.660
Remember I'm covering this up.,00:23:25.660,00:23:28.690
"So that's all there is on
the left-hand side.",00:23:28.690,00:23:30.790
"And on the right-hand side all
there is C. Everything else",00:23:30.790,00:23:38.300
"got killed off, because it
was x - 2 times that.",00:23:38.300,00:23:40.580
"That's 0 times all
that other stuff.",00:23:40.580,00:23:42.570
"And the x - 2 over
here canceled.",00:23:42.570,00:23:45.240
"This is the shortcut that I just
described, and this is",00:23:45.240,00:23:47.710
"much faster than doing
all that arithmetic.",00:23:47.710,00:23:50.920
And algebra.,00:23:50.920,00:23:52.620
"So all together this
is a 6/9, right?",00:23:52.620,00:23:57.160
"So it's C = 6/9, which is 2/3.",00:23:57.160,00:24:09.140
"Now, the other one which is easy
to do, I'm going to do by",00:24:09.140,00:24:13.500
"the slow method first.
But you omit a term.",00:24:13.500,00:24:17.350
"The idea is to cover up
the other bad factor.",00:24:17.350,00:24:23.380
"Cover ups, I'll do it both
the way and the slow way.",00:24:23.380,00:24:27.480
"I'll do it the fast way first,
and then I'll show",00:24:27.480,00:24:29.330
you the slow way.,00:24:29.330,00:24:30.440
"The fast way is to
cover this up.",00:24:30.440,00:24:32.470
"And then I have to cover
up everything else.",00:24:32.470,00:24:34.300
That gets eliminated.,00:24:34.300,00:24:35.740
"And that includes everything
but B. So I",00:24:35.740,00:24:39.150
get B on this side.,00:24:39.150,00:24:40.950
And I get 1 on that side.,00:24:40.950,00:24:42.970
So that's 1 ^2 + 2 / 1 + 2.,00:24:42.970,00:24:48.340
"So in other words, B = 1.",00:24:48.340,00:24:56.250
"That was pretty fast, so let
me show you what arithmetic",00:24:56.250,00:24:58.710
was hiding behind that.,00:24:58.710,00:25:00.060
"What algebra was hiding
behind it.",00:25:00.060,00:25:01.690
"What I was really
doing is this.",00:25:01.690,00:25:06.900
"In multiplying through by
x - 1 ^2, so I got this.",00:25:06.900,00:25:16.390
"So this canceled here, so this
C just stands alone.",00:25:16.390,00:25:19.910
"And then I have here C
/x + 2 (x - 1) ^2.",00:25:19.910,00:25:26.290
"Notice again, I cleared out
that 1, this term from the",00:25:26.290,00:25:30.910
"denominator and sent it over
to the other side.",00:25:30.910,00:25:33.600
"Now, what's happening is that
when I set x = 1 here, this",00:25:33.600,00:25:41.870
term is dying.,00:25:41.870,00:25:43.050
"This term is going away, because
there's more powers in",00:25:43.050,00:25:45.840
"the numerator than in
the denominator.",00:25:45.840,00:25:47.840
This is still 0.,00:25:47.840,00:25:50.070
And this one is gone also.,00:25:50.070,00:25:52.330
"So all that's left is B. Now, I
cannot pull that off with a",00:25:52.330,00:25:58.280
single power of x - 1.,00:25:58.280,00:25:59.820
I can't expose the A term.,00:25:59.820,00:26:02.250
"It's the B term that
I can expose.",00:26:02.250,00:26:04.230
"Because I can multiply through
by this thing squared.",00:26:04.230,00:26:06.170
"If I multiply through by just x
- 1, what'll happen here is",00:26:06.170,00:26:10.390
"I won't have canceled
this (x - 1 )^2.",00:26:10.390,00:26:12.520
It's useless.,00:26:12.520,00:26:13.160
"I still have a 0 in
the denominator.",00:26:13.160,00:26:15.020
"I'll have B / 0 when
I plug in x = 1.",00:26:15.020,00:26:17.150
Which I can't use.,00:26:17.150,00:26:22.060
"Again, the cover-up method is
giving us B and C, not A.",00:26:22.060,00:26:32.950
"Now, for the last term, for A,
I'm going to just have to be",00:26:32.950,00:26:38.520
straightforward about it.,00:26:38.520,00:26:40.380
"And so I'll just suggest
for A, plug in",00:26:40.380,00:26:48.780
your favorite number.,00:26:48.780,00:26:51.260
So plug in my favorite number.,00:26:51.260,00:26:59.510
Which is x = 0.,00:26:59.510,00:27:01.430
"And you won't be able to
plug in x = 0 if you've",00:27:01.430,00:27:04.860
already used it.,00:27:04.860,00:27:05.700
"Here the two numbers we've
already used are x",00:27:05.700,00:27:08.440
= 1 and x = - 2.,00:27:08.440,00:27:13.820
"But we haven't used x =
0 yet, so that's good.",00:27:13.820,00:27:18.300
"I'm going to plug in now x
= 0 into the equation.",00:27:18.300,00:27:21.400
What do I get?,00:27:21.400,00:27:22.450
"I get 0 ^2 + 2 / (- 1) ^2 *
2 is equal to, let's see.",00:27:22.450,00:27:35.070
"A is the thing that
I don't know.",00:27:35.070,00:27:36.800
"So it's A / - 1 +, B /
x - 1 ^2 so B = 1, so",00:27:36.800,00:27:44.630
that's 1 / (- 1) ^2.,00:27:44.630,00:27:48.190
And then C was 2/3.,00:27:48.190,00:27:51.760
2/3 / x + 2.,00:27:51.760,00:27:55.256
So that's 0 + 2.,00:27:55.256,00:28:00.900
Don't give up at this point.,00:28:00.900,00:28:02.690
This is a lot of algebra.,00:28:02.690,00:28:03.900
"You really have to plug
in all these numbers.",00:28:03.900,00:28:06.290
"You make one arithmetic mistake
and you're always",00:28:06.290,00:28:08.400
going to get the wrong answer.,00:28:08.400,00:28:09.480
"This is very arithmetically
intensive.",00:28:09.480,00:28:16.790
"However, it does simplify
at this point.",00:28:16.790,00:28:18.980
"We have 2 / 2, that's 1.",00:28:18.980,00:28:22.680
Is equal to - A + 1 + 1/3.,00:28:22.680,00:28:27.790
So let's see.,00:28:27.790,00:28:29.050
"A on the other side, this
becomes A = 1/3.",00:28:29.050,00:28:34.920
And that's it.,00:28:34.920,00:28:35.520
This is the end.,00:28:35.520,00:28:36.600
"We've we've simplified
our function.",00:28:36.600,00:28:40.020
And now it's easy to integrate.,00:28:40.020,00:28:48.290
Question.,00:28:48.290,00:28:48.780
Another question.,00:28:48.780,00:28:49.350
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:28:49.350,00:29:02.010
"PROFESSOR: So the question is,
if x = 0 has already been",00:29:02.010,00:29:04.230
"used, what do I do?",00:29:04.230,00:29:05.590
"And the answer is, pick
something else.",00:29:05.590,00:29:10.050
"And you said pick
a random number.",00:29:10.050,00:29:11.440
"And that's right, except that if
you really picked a random",00:29:11.440,00:29:13.940
"number it would be 4.12567843,
which would be difficult.",00:29:13.940,00:29:19.110
"What you want to pick is the
easiest possible number you",00:29:19.110,00:29:21.780
can think of.,00:29:21.780,00:29:24.450
Yeah.,00:29:24.450,00:29:24.740
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:29:24.740,00:29:32.710
"PROFESSOR: If you had, as in
this sort of situation here.",00:29:32.710,00:29:37.050
More powers.,00:29:37.050,00:29:39.690
"Wouldn't you have
more variables.",00:29:39.690,00:29:41.610
Very good question.,00:29:41.610,00:29:42.900
That's absolutely right.,00:29:42.900,00:29:44.490
"This was a 3 by 3 system in
disguise, for these three",00:29:44.490,00:29:48.440
"unknowns, A, B and C. What we
started with in the previous",00:29:48.440,00:29:51.580
problem was two variables.,00:29:51.580,00:29:53.950
"It's over here, the variables A
and B. And as the degree of",00:29:53.950,00:29:57.430
"the denominator goes up, the
number of variables goes up.",00:29:57.430,00:30:02.900
"It gets more and more and
more complicated.",00:30:02.900,00:30:05.040
"More and more arithmetically
intensive.",00:30:05.040,00:30:06.820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:30:06.820,00:30:09.220
"PROFESSOR: Well, so.",00:30:09.220,00:30:09.910
"The question is, how would
you solve it if",00:30:09.910,00:30:11.170
you have two unknowns.,00:30:11.170,00:30:12.880
That's exactly the point here.,00:30:12.880,00:30:16.610
"This is a system
of simultaneous",00:30:16.610,00:30:18.420
equations for unknowns.,00:30:18.420,00:30:19.560
"And we have little tricks for
isolating single variables.",00:30:19.560,00:30:23.180
"Otherwise we're stuck with
solving the whole system.",00:30:23.180,00:30:25.880
"And you'd have to solve the
whole system by elimination,",00:30:25.880,00:30:28.560
various other tricks.,00:30:28.560,00:30:35.980
"I'll say a little more
about that later.",00:30:35.980,00:30:38.950
"Now, I have to get one
step more complicated",00:30:38.950,00:30:47.610
with my next example.,00:30:47.610,00:30:53.560
"My next example is going to
have a quadratic factor.",00:30:53.560,00:31:02.860
"So still I'm sticking to the
degree of the polynomial and",00:31:02.860,00:31:05.900
"the numerator is less than the
degree of the polynomial in",00:31:05.900,00:31:08.570
the denominator.,00:31:08.570,00:31:09.660
"And I'm going to take
the case where Q",00:31:09.660,00:31:12.100
has a quadratic factor.,00:31:12.100,00:31:21.700
"Let me just again illustrate
this by example.",00:31:21.700,00:31:26.140
I have here (x - 1) (x^2 + 1).,00:31:26.140,00:31:30.470
"I'll make it about as
easy as they come.",00:31:30.470,00:31:34.630
"Now, the setup will be slightly
different here.",00:31:34.630,00:31:38.830
Here's the setup.,00:31:38.830,00:31:40.510
It's already factored.,00:31:40.510,00:31:42.570
"I've already done as
much as I can do.",00:31:42.570,00:31:44.360
"I can't factor this x^2 + 1 into
linear factors unless you",00:31:44.360,00:31:48.720
know about complex numbers.,00:31:48.720,00:31:49.940
"If you know about complex
numbers this method becomes",00:31:49.940,00:31:52.380
much easier.,00:31:52.380,00:31:53.170
"And it comes back to the
cover-up method.",00:31:53.170,00:31:55.400
"Which is the way that the
cover-up method was originally",00:31:55.400,00:31:58.370
conceived by heavy side.,00:31:58.370,00:32:01.060
"But you won't get to
that until 18.03.",00:32:01.060,00:32:04.280
So we'll wait.,00:32:04.280,00:32:05.610
"This, by the way, is a method
which is used for integration.",00:32:05.610,00:32:08.360
"But it was invented to do
something with Laplace",00:32:08.360,00:32:11.580
"transforms and inversion
of certain kinds of",00:32:11.580,00:32:14.410
differential equations.,00:32:14.410,00:32:15.600
By heavy side.,00:32:15.600,00:32:17.020
"And so it came much later
than integration.",00:32:17.020,00:32:21.530
"But anyway, it's a very
convenient method.",00:32:21.530,00:32:26.360
"So here's the set up
with this one.",00:32:26.360,00:32:30.210
"Again, we want a term for
this (x - 1) factor.",00:32:30.210,00:32:34.440
"And now we're going to also
have a term with the",00:32:34.440,00:32:36.690
denominator x squared plus 1.,00:32:36.690,00:32:39.120
But this is the difference.,00:32:39.120,00:32:40.760
"It's now going to be a first
degree polynomial.",00:32:40.760,00:32:44.590
"One degree down from
the quadratic here.",00:32:44.590,00:32:53.040
"So this is what I keep
on calling the setup,",00:32:53.040,00:32:55.620
this is number 2.,00:32:55.620,00:32:57.250
"You have to know that in advance
based on the pattern",00:32:57.250,00:32:59.870
"that you see on the
left-hand side.",00:32:59.870,00:33:03.350
Yes.,00:33:03.350,00:33:03.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:33:03.660,00:33:13.680
"PROFESSOR: The question is, if
the degree of the numerator.",00:33:13.680,00:33:15.130
"So in this case, if this were
cubed, and this is matching",00:33:15.130,00:33:19.520
"with the denominator, which
is total of degree 3.",00:33:19.520,00:33:23.590
"The answer is that this
does not work.",00:33:23.590,00:33:26.910
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:33:26.910,00:33:29.150
"PROFESSOR: It definitely
doesn't work.",00:33:29.150,00:33:31.260
"And we're going to have to
do something totally",00:33:31.260,00:33:32.950
different to handle it.,00:33:32.950,00:33:34.050
"Which turns out, fortunately,
to be much easier than this.",00:33:34.050,00:33:37.180
"But we'll deal with
that at the end.",00:33:37.180,00:33:41.850
Keep this in mind.,00:33:41.850,00:33:43.320
"This is an easy way to make a
mistake if you start with a",00:33:43.320,00:33:45.500
higher degree numerator.,00:33:45.500,00:33:47.230
"You'll never get the
right answer.",00:33:47.230,00:33:51.300
"So now, so I have
my setup now.",00:33:51.300,00:33:54.870
And now what can I do?,00:33:54.870,00:33:56.840
"Well, I claim that I can still
do cover-up for A.",00:33:56.840,00:34:03.970
It's the same idea.,00:34:03.970,00:34:05.790
I cover this guy up.,00:34:05.790,00:34:07.680
"And if I really multiply by it
it would knock everything out",00:34:07.680,00:34:10.460
"but A. So I cover this up
and I plug in x = 1.",00:34:10.460,00:34:14.550
"So I get here 1 ^2 / 1 ^2 + 1 =
A. In other words, A = 1/2.",00:34:14.550,00:34:25.460
"Again cover-up is pretty
fast, as you can see.",00:34:25.460,00:34:28.560
It's not too bad.,00:34:28.560,00:34:32.030
"Now, at this next stage, I want
to find B and C. And the",00:34:32.030,00:34:42.330
best idea is the slow way.,00:34:42.330,00:34:45.990
"Here, it's not too terrible.",00:34:45.990,00:34:48.120
"But it's just what we're
going to do.",00:34:48.120,00:34:50.010
"Which is to clear the
denominators completely.",00:34:50.010,00:34:54.270
"So for B and C, just clear
the denominator.",00:34:54.270,00:35:05.520
"That means multiply through
by that whole business.",00:35:05.520,00:35:08.220
"Now, when you do that on the
left-hand side you're",00:35:08.220,00:35:09.770
going to get x ^2.,00:35:09.770,00:35:10.870
"Because I got rid of the
whole denominator.",00:35:10.870,00:35:12.940
"On the right-hand side when I
bring this up, the x - 1 will",00:35:12.940,00:35:17.100
cancel with this.,00:35:17.100,00:35:18.600
"So the a term will
be A ( x ^2 + 1).",00:35:18.600,00:35:23.160
"And the Bx + C term will have
a remaining factor of x - 1.",00:35:23.160,00:35:29.230
"Because the x ^2 +
1 will cancel.",00:35:29.230,00:35:33.300
"Again, the arithmetic here
is not too terrible.",00:35:33.300,00:35:38.670
"Now I'm going to do
the following.",00:35:38.670,00:35:41.000
"I'm going to look at
the x ^2 term.",00:35:41.000,00:35:46.550
"On the left-hand side and
the right-hand side.",00:35:46.550,00:35:49.580
"And that will give me one
equation for B and C. And then",00:35:49.580,00:35:52.370
"I'm going to do the same thing
with another term.",00:35:52.370,00:35:54.490
"The x^2 term on the left-hand
side, the coefficient is 1.",00:35:54.490,00:35:57.350
It's 1 ( x ^2).,00:35:57.350,00:35:59.740
"On the other side, it's A.
remember I actually have A. So",00:35:59.740,00:36:06.250
"I'm going to put it
in, it's 1/2.",00:36:06.250,00:36:08.870
So this is the A term.,00:36:08.870,00:36:11.250
And so I get 1/2 ( x ^2).,00:36:11.250,00:36:14.020
"And then the only other
x^2 is when this Bx",00:36:14.020,00:36:16.310
multiplies this x.,00:36:16.310,00:36:18.640
"So Bx * x is Bx ^2, so this is
the other coefficient on x ^2",00:36:18.640,00:36:24.275
"is B. And that forces
B to be 1/2.",00:36:24.275,00:36:36.060
"And last of all, I'm going to
do the x^ 0 power term.",00:36:36.060,00:36:41.370
"Or, otherwise known as
the constant term.",00:36:41.370,00:36:44.530
"And on the left-hand side,
the constant term is 0.",00:36:44.530,00:36:48.650
There is no constant term.,00:36:48.650,00:36:51.270
"On the right-hand side there's
a constant term, 1/2 * 1.",00:36:51.270,00:36:57.310
That's 1/2 here.,00:36:57.310,00:36:58.520
"And then there's another
constant term, which is this",00:36:58.520,00:37:01.580
constant times this - 1.,00:37:01.580,00:37:03.860
"Which is - C. And so
the conclusion",00:37:03.860,00:37:10.630
here is that C = 1/2.,00:37:10.630,00:37:18.070
Another question.,00:37:18.070,00:37:18.660
Yeah.,00:37:18.660,00:37:19.030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:37:19.030,00:37:33.130
"PROFESSOR: There's also an x^
0 power hidden in here.",00:37:33.130,00:37:37.970
"Sorry, an x ^ 1 , that's what
you were asking about, sorry.",00:37:37.970,00:37:40.890
There's also an x ^ 1 .,00:37:40.890,00:37:42.400
"The only reason why I didn't
go to the x^ 1 is that it",00:37:42.400,00:37:45.600
"turns out with these two
I didn't need it.",00:37:45.600,00:37:49.080
"The other thing is that by
experience, I know that the",00:37:49.080,00:37:51.650
"extreme ends of the
multiplication",00:37:51.650,00:37:53.320
are the easiest ends.,00:37:53.320,00:37:54.690
"And the middle terms have tons
of cross terms. And so I don't",00:37:54.690,00:37:57.830
"like the middle term as much
because it always involves",00:37:57.830,00:38:00.080
more arithmetic.,00:38:00.080,00:38:01.130
"So I stick to the lowest and
the highest terms if I can.",00:38:01.130,00:38:05.530
"So that was really
a sneaky thing.",00:38:05.530,00:38:07.390
"I did that without
saying anything.",00:38:07.390,00:38:10.470
Yes.,00:38:10.470,00:38:10.960
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:38:10.960,00:38:14.440
"PROFESSOR: Another
good question.",00:38:14.440,00:38:15.470
Could I just set equals 0?,00:38:15.470,00:38:17.120
Absolutely.,00:38:17.120,00:38:17.910
"In fact, that's equivalent to
picking out the x^ 0 term.",00:38:17.910,00:38:22.370
And you could plug in numbers.,00:38:22.370,00:38:24.150
If you wanted.,00:38:24.150,00:38:25.140
"That's another way of doing
this besides doing that.",00:38:25.140,00:38:27.820
"So you can also plug
in numbers.",00:38:27.820,00:38:30.930
Can plug in numbers. x = 0.,00:38:30.930,00:38:38.060
"Actually, not x = 1,
right? - 1, 2, etc.",00:38:38.060,00:38:44.330
"Not 1 just because we've
already used it.",00:38:44.330,00:38:46.000
"We won't get interesting
information out.",00:38:46.000,00:38:48.400
Yes.,00:38:48.400,00:38:48.770
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:38:48.770,00:38:56.820
"PROFESSOR: So the question
is, could I have done",00:38:56.820,00:38:58.290
it this other way.,00:38:58.290,00:38:59.900
"With the polynomial, with
this other one.",00:38:59.900,00:39:02.880
"Yes, absolutely.",00:39:02.880,00:39:04.020
"So in other words what I've
taught you now is two choices",00:39:04.020,00:39:07.210
which are equally reasonable.,00:39:07.210,00:39:09.480
"The one that I picked was the
one that was the fastest for",00:39:09.480,00:39:12.670
"this guy and the one that was
fastest for this one, but I",00:39:12.670,00:39:15.700
"could've done the other
way around.",00:39:15.700,00:39:19.040
"There are a lot of
ways of solving",00:39:19.040,00:39:20.990
simultaneous equations.,00:39:20.990,00:39:22.490
"Yeah, another question.",00:39:22.490,00:39:23.803
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:23.803,00:39:24.610
"PROFESSOR: The question
is the following.",00:39:24.610,00:39:25.930
"So now everybody can understand
the question.",00:39:25.930,00:39:28.610
"If this, instead of being x
^2 + 1, this were x^3 + 1.",00:39:28.610,00:39:33.640
"So that's an important
case to understand.",00:39:33.640,00:39:36.360
"That's a case in which
this denominator",00:39:36.360,00:39:38.910
is not fully factored.,00:39:38.910,00:39:41.020
"So it's an x^3 + 1, you would
have to factor out an x + 1.",00:39:41.020,00:39:46.830
"So that would be a situation
like this, you have an x^3 +",00:39:46.830,00:39:49.350
"1, but that's (x + 1)( x^2 +
x + 1), this kind of thing.",00:39:49.350,00:39:57.740
"If that's the right, there
must be a minus",00:39:57.740,00:39:59.770
sign in here maybe.,00:39:59.770,00:40:01.830
"OK, something like this.",00:40:01.830,00:40:03.240
Right?,00:40:03.240,00:40:07.360
Isn't that what it is?,00:40:07.360,00:40:08.190
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:40:08.190,00:40:12.000
PROFESSOR: I think it's right.,00:40:12.000,00:40:12.810
"But anyway, the point is that
you have to factor it.",00:40:12.810,00:40:15.930
"And then you have a linear
and a quadratic.",00:40:15.930,00:40:17.920
"So you're always going to be
faced eventually with linear",00:40:17.920,00:40:21.390
factors and quadratic factors.,00:40:21.390,00:40:23.910
"If you have a cubic, that means
you haven't factored",00:40:23.910,00:40:25.650
sufficiently.,00:40:25.650,00:40:28.620
"So you're still back
in Step 1.",00:40:28.620,00:40:32.490
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:40:32.490,00:40:32.780
"PROFESSOR: In the
x^3 + 1 case?",00:40:32.780,00:40:34.500
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:40:34.500,00:40:36.610
"PROFESSOR: In the x^3 + 1 case,
we are out of luck until",00:40:36.610,00:40:39.610
"we've completed the
factorization.",00:40:39.610,00:40:41.700
"Once we've completed the
factorization, we're going to",00:40:41.700,00:40:44.160
"have to deal with these two
factors as denominators.",00:40:44.160,00:40:48.920
"So it'll be this plus something
over x + 1 + a Bx +",00:40:48.920,00:40:54.410
"C type of thing over
this thing here.",00:40:54.410,00:40:58.160
"That's what's eventually
going to happen.",00:40:58.160,00:41:01.730
But hold on to that idea.,00:41:01.730,00:41:03.940
"Let me carry out one
more example here.",00:41:03.940,00:41:14.340
"So I've figured out what
all the values are.",00:41:14.340,00:41:17.870
"But I think it's also worth it
to remember now that we also",00:41:17.870,00:41:21.910
"have to carry out
the integration.",00:41:21.910,00:41:29.140
"What I've just shown you is that
the integral of x ^2 dx",00:41:29.140,00:41:36.590
"over (x - 1)( x ^2 + 1) is equal
to, and I've split up",00:41:36.590,00:41:42.770
into these pieces.,00:41:42.770,00:41:43.970
So what are the pieces?,00:41:43.970,00:41:45.070
"The pieces are, 1/2, x -
1 + 1/2 x / x ^2 + 1.",00:41:45.070,00:42:01.560
This is the A term.,00:42:01.560,00:42:02.990
This is the B term.,00:42:02.990,00:42:04.400
And then there's the C term.,00:42:04.400,00:42:12.460
"So we'd better remember
that we know how to",00:42:12.460,00:42:15.550
"antidifferentiate
these things.",00:42:15.550,00:42:18.300
"In other words, I want to
finish the problem.",00:42:18.300,00:42:20.320
"The others were pretty easy, so
I didn't bother to finish",00:42:20.320,00:42:22.680
"my sentence, but here I want
to be careful and have you",00:42:22.680,00:42:25.680
"realize that there's something
a little more to do.",00:42:25.680,00:42:28.850
"First of all we have the, the
first one is no problem.",00:42:28.850,00:42:31.340
That's this.,00:42:31.340,00:42:35.240
"The second one actually
is not too bad either.",00:42:35.240,00:42:39.910
"This is, by the advanced
guessing method, my favorite",00:42:39.910,00:42:45.880
"method, something like the
logarithm, because that's",00:42:45.880,00:42:48.660
"what's going to appear
in the denominator.",00:42:48.660,00:42:50.070
"And then, if you differentiate
this, you're going",00:42:50.070,00:42:51.935
to get 2x over this.,00:42:51.935,00:42:53.620
But here we have 1/2.,00:42:53.620,00:42:55.030
"So altogether it's
1/4 of this.",00:42:55.030,00:42:59.470
"So I fixed the coefficient
here.",00:42:59.470,00:43:02.470
"And then the last one, you have
to think back to some",00:43:02.470,00:43:06.580
"level of memorization here and
remember that this is 1/2 the",00:43:06.580,00:43:10.310
arc tangent.,00:43:10.310,00:43:15.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:43:15.610,00:43:20.870
"PROFESSOR: Why did
I go to 1/4?",00:43:20.870,00:43:22.200
"Because in disguise, for this
guy, I was thinking d / dx of",00:43:22.200,00:43:26.810
ln (x ^2 + 1) = 2x / x^2 + 1.,00:43:26.810,00:43:35.140
"Because it's the derivative
of this divided by itself.",00:43:35.140,00:43:39.880
"This is the derivative
of ln u is u ' / u.",00:43:39.880,00:43:46.140
Ln u' = u' / u.,00:43:46.140,00:43:50.030
That was what I applied.,00:43:50.030,00:43:54.350
"And what I had was 1/2, so I
need a total of 1/4 to cancel.",00:43:54.350,00:43:58.210
So 2/4 is 1/2.,00:43:58.210,00:44:06.640
"Now I've got to get you out
of one more deep hole.",00:44:06.640,00:44:09.990
"And I'm going to save the
general pattern for next time.",00:44:09.990,00:44:12.900
"But I do want to clarify
one thing.",00:44:12.900,00:44:27.860
So let's handle this thing.,00:44:27.860,00:44:30.040
"What if the degree of P is
bigger than or equal to the",00:44:30.040,00:44:34.240
"degree of Q. That's the thing
that I claimed was easier.",00:44:34.240,00:44:42.810
"And I'm going to describe
to you how it's done.",00:44:42.810,00:44:45.880
"Now, in analogy, with numbers
you might call this an",00:44:45.880,00:44:49.990
improper fraction.,00:44:49.990,00:44:55.070
"That's the thing that should
echo in your mind when you're",00:44:55.070,00:45:00.100
thinking about this.,00:45:00.100,00:45:01.970
"And I'm just going to do
it by example here.",00:45:01.970,00:45:04.600
"Let's see., I cooked up an
example so that I don't make",00:45:04.600,00:45:08.860
"an arithmetistic mistake
along the way.",00:45:08.860,00:45:11.220
"So there are two or three steps
that I need to explain.",00:45:11.220,00:45:16.990
So here's an example.,00:45:16.990,00:45:18.030
"The denominator's degree 2,
the numerator is degree 3.",00:45:18.030,00:45:21.320
"It well exceeds, so there's
a problem here.",00:45:21.320,00:45:24.610
"Our method is not
going to work.",00:45:24.610,00:45:27.880
"And the first step that I
want to carry out is to",00:45:27.880,00:45:32.620
reverse Step 1.,00:45:32.620,00:45:36.370
"That is, I don't want the
factorization for what I'm",00:45:36.370,00:45:38.940
going to do next.,00:45:38.940,00:45:39.620
I want it multiplied out.,00:45:39.620,00:45:42.040
"That means I have to multiply
through, so I",00:45:42.040,00:45:44.230
get x ^2 + x - 2.,00:45:44.230,00:45:48.670
"I'm back to the starting
place here.",00:45:48.670,00:45:52.980
"And now, the next thing that I'm
going to do is, I'm going",00:45:52.980,00:45:57.115
to use long division.,00:45:57.115,00:46:01.130
"That's how you convert
an improper",00:46:01.130,00:46:03.400
fraction to a proper fraction.,00:46:03.400,00:46:07.530
"This is something you were
supposed to learn in, I don't",00:46:07.530,00:46:12.710
"know, Grade 4, I know.",00:46:12.710,00:46:16.780
"Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade
5, Grade 6, etc.",00:46:16.780,00:46:23.970
"So here's how it works in
the case of polynomials.",00:46:23.970,00:46:27.560
It's kind of amusing.,00:46:27.560,00:46:31.030
"So we're dividing this
polynomial into that one.",00:46:31.030,00:46:37.760
"And so the quotient to first
order here is x.",00:46:37.760,00:46:41.950
"That is, that's going to match
the top terms. So I get",00:46:41.950,00:46:44.710
x^3 + x ^2 - 2x.,00:46:44.710,00:46:48.500
That's the product.,00:46:48.500,00:46:50.310
And now I subtract.,00:46:50.310,00:46:51.890
And it cancels.,00:46:51.890,00:46:53.990
So we get here - x ^2 + 2x.,00:46:53.990,00:46:58.440
That's the difference.,00:46:58.440,00:47:01.110
"And now I need to divide
this next term in.",00:47:01.110,00:47:04.260
And I need a - 1.,00:47:04.260,00:47:08.190
"So - 1 times this is
- x ^2 - x + 2.",00:47:08.190,00:47:14.700
And I subtract.,00:47:14.700,00:47:16.260
And the x^2's cancel.,00:47:16.260,00:47:17.800
And here I get + 3x - 2.,00:47:17.800,00:47:24.210
"Now, this thing has a name.",00:47:24.210,00:47:27.090
This is called the quotient.,00:47:27.090,00:47:30.880
"And this thing also
has a name.",00:47:30.880,00:47:33.090
This is called the remainder.,00:47:33.090,00:47:39.070
"And now I'll show you how it
works by sticking it into the",00:47:39.070,00:47:43.960
answer here.,00:47:43.960,00:47:44.560
The quotient is x - 1.,00:47:44.560,00:47:47.250
"And the remainder is, let's
get down there.",00:47:47.250,00:47:51.000
3x - 2 / x ^2 + x - 2.,00:47:51.000,00:47:58.820
"So the punchline here
is that this",00:47:58.820,00:48:03.110
thing is easy to integrate.,00:48:03.110,00:48:05.450
This is easy.,00:48:05.450,00:48:08.190
"And this one, you can use, now
you can use cover-up, The",00:48:08.190,00:48:17.460
method that we had before.,00:48:17.460,00:48:18.480
"Because the degree of the
numerator is now below the",00:48:18.480,00:48:21.490
degree of the denominator.,00:48:21.490,00:48:22.700
"It's now first degree and
this is second degree.",00:48:22.700,00:48:25.920
"What you can't do is
use cover-up to",00:48:25.920,00:48:27.960
start out with here.,00:48:27.960,00:48:29.950
"That will give you
the wrong answer.",00:48:29.950,00:48:32.630
"So that's the end for today,
and see you next time.",00:48:32.630,00:48:37.320
