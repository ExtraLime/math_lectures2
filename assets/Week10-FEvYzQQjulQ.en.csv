"&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: All right, welcome back.",00:00:11.000,00:00:13.640
"This is CS50, and this is
the start of week 10.",00:00:13.640,00:00:16.210
"So, for the past several weeks, we've
been looking at a fairly low level how",00:00:16.210,00:00:19.940
the internet works.,00:00:19.940,00:00:20.930
"TCP/IP, HTTP, the language [? top ?]
which we've begun to build interesting",00:00:20.930,00:00:26.080
"things in languages like HTML, CSS,
PHP, and most recently JavaScript.",00:00:26.080,00:00:31.270
"&gt;&gt; Today, though, we're joined by Jonathan
Zittrain, a professor at",00:00:31.270,00:00:34.630
"Harvard Law School, at Harvard Kennedy
School, and the Harvard School of",00:00:34.630,00:00:37.760
"Engineering and Applied Sciences, who
most recently taught a course called",00:00:37.760,00:00:41.150
"Computer Science 42, Controlling
Cyberspace.",00:00:41.150,00:00:45.850
"Today, we are poised to now look at a
much bigger picture, and undoubtedly a",00:00:45.850,00:00:51.600
"bit at how life, the universe, and
everything works, with our friend,",00:00:51.600,00:00:56.650
professor Jonathan Zittrain.,00:00:56.650,00:00:57.900
"&gt;&gt; JONATHAN ZITTRAIN: Thank you,
David, and good afternoon.",00:01:04.629,00:01:07.390
"You are in an incredible
course, as you know.",00:01:07.390,00:01:10.650
"You are apprenticing to a set of
technologies that are really unusual,",00:01:10.650,00:01:15.860
"and I want to talk today about what
makes them so unusual, why we should",00:01:15.860,00:01:20.190
"care about it, and why they might be
evolving in the future in directions",00:01:20.190,00:01:24.850
that we don't like.,00:01:24.850,00:01:25.700
"And possibly even what to do about it,
although I realize we have about 49",00:01:25.700,00:01:29.510
"minutes and 30 seconds yet, so
some corners may be cut.",00:01:29.510,00:01:34.900
"&gt;&gt; Maybe a framework to think about
this stuff is technologies",00:01:34.900,00:01:38.080
as owned and unowned.,00:01:38.080,00:01:42.530
"And I want to explain what I
mean by owned and unowned.",00:01:42.530,00:01:45.870
"Most technology in the world is owned,
and I'll give a few examples of that.",00:01:45.870,00:01:52.490
"But the internet turns out to be an
unowned technology, and that can make",00:01:52.490,00:01:57.020
all the difference.,00:01:57.020,00:01:57.900
&gt;&gt; So here are some owned technologies.,00:01:57.900,00:02:02.210
This is the IBM System/360.,00:02:02.210,00:02:06.270
"This was a serious computer back
in its day, and as you can see,",00:02:06.270,00:02:10.169
"everything about it radiates that you
had better not go anywhere near it.",00:02:10.169,00:02:14.250
"This is the kind of computer that sat
in the basement of a big company--",00:02:14.250,00:02:18.260
"an actuary, an insurance company, a
bank, or maybe a government tallying",00:02:18.260,00:02:22.780
the census.,00:02:22.780,00:02:23.960
"And it was programmed, usually, by the
vendor who operated the machine, in",00:02:23.960,00:02:27.830
this case IBM.,00:02:27.830,00:02:29.320
"And that's because, while it was a
general purpose computer, it could be",00:02:29.320,00:02:32.570
"programmed or reprogrammed, it was so
precious and delicate, and part of the",00:02:32.570,00:02:36.580
"business model of IBM was to keep
it apart from its consumer.",00:02:36.580,00:02:42.820
"&gt;&gt; You would instead tell IBM what you
wanted, and then they would go ahead",00:02:42.820,00:02:46.660
and program it for you.,00:02:46.660,00:02:47.780
"Not a bad deal, but a very owned
technology in the sense that we know",00:02:47.780,00:02:52.590
"who is responsible for it, and whom to
blame if something goes wrong with it,",00:02:52.590,00:02:56.870
"and it means that we're not going to
get that surprised by it, because",00:02:56.870,00:03:01.170
"everybody is so careful about what
they use the computer for.",00:03:01.170,00:03:05.970
"Now, these are the sorts of
things that went into it.",00:03:05.970,00:03:09.660
"Those are, of course, old-fashioned
punch cards, and those represented,",00:03:09.660,00:03:14.820
"again, that you could program the
machine in any way that you wanted, so",00:03:14.820,00:03:18.780
"long as you could get near it, which
again, generally, you could not.",00:03:18.780,00:03:23.350
"&gt;&gt; This is another kind of technology
that is also owned.",00:03:23.350,00:03:25.930
This is the Friden Flexowriter.,00:03:25.930,00:03:28.170
"And the Friden Flexowriter was like a
standard typewriter, and as you typed,",00:03:28.170,00:03:34.480
"the letters would appear on the paper,
but it would also make for little",00:03:34.480,00:03:38.210
"indentations in this tape
that ran through it.",00:03:38.210,00:03:40.970
"And the tape, if put back through the
typewriter like a player piano, would",00:03:40.970,00:03:46.300
"type out whatever had previously
been done.",00:03:46.300,00:03:48.850
"Which meant that with enough scissors
and glue, you could actually cut and",00:03:48.850,00:03:52.330
"paste your way to a mail merge
more easily than you can",00:03:52.330,00:03:55.240
with Microsoft Word.,00:03:55.240,00:03:56.820
"&gt;&gt; So, the Flexowriter was very cool.",00:03:56.820,00:03:59.110
It was very accessible.,00:03:59.110,00:04:01.030
"It doesn't threaten to electrocute
you if you go near it.",00:04:01.030,00:04:04.210
"But there's no place to put a punch
card to tell it what to do.",00:04:04.210,00:04:10.040
The only punch technology is data.,00:04:10.040,00:04:12.960
"Type what you see, or it generates
that strip as you type.",00:04:12.960,00:04:17.930
There's no code.,00:04:17.930,00:04:19.200
"There's only content with the
Flexowriter, and its successors are",00:04:19.200,00:04:24.200
"what the world of the 1980s and 1990s
was shaping up to be for information",00:04:24.200,00:04:29.960
technology.,00:04:29.960,00:04:31.060
"&gt;&gt; This is the Brother Smart
Word Processor.",00:04:31.060,00:04:33.620
"You turn this thing on, this
is its home screen.",00:04:33.620,00:04:36.660
Where would you like to go today?,00:04:36.660,00:04:38.730
"Word processing, spreadsheet,
et cetera, et cetera.",00:04:38.730,00:04:42.980
"And the way this thing worked on
Wednesday it was exactly the way it",00:04:42.980,00:04:47.720
"worked on Tuesday, and was the way
it was going to work until",00:04:47.720,00:04:51.840
you got rid of it.,00:04:51.840,00:04:53.220
It was not programmable.,00:04:53.220,00:04:54.750
"&gt;&gt; Again, it only dealt with data, and it's
an owned technology, because how",00:04:54.750,00:04:58.700
"it would act was very much an
artifact of what the Brother",00:04:58.700,00:05:02.750
people put into it.,00:05:02.750,00:05:04.550
"Ditto, one might hope, for
a CAT scan machine.",00:05:04.550,00:05:07.150
"You want it to operate exactly as it
was designed, although they are",00:05:07.150,00:05:11.650
"slightly reprogrammable in
the IBM System/360 way.",00:05:11.650,00:05:15.820
"Again, we see some risks, some
unpleasant surprises that could come",00:05:15.820,00:05:19.270
"if you have the wrong people programming
your CAT scanner, as",00:05:19.270,00:05:22.410
"actually has happened in
the past few years.",00:05:22.410,00:05:25.020
"But now, part of this CAT scanner is a
little piece of what I would describe",00:05:25.020,00:05:29.290
"as an unowned technology
in the middle of it.",00:05:29.290,00:05:32.220
And that is the personal computer.,00:05:32.220,00:05:35.070
"&gt;&gt; So let's look at the unowned technology
that got things started.",00:05:35.070,00:05:39.400
"This is Steve Jobs at the West Coast
Computer Faire in 1977, described as",00:05:39.400,00:05:45.390
"10,000 walking, talking
computer freaks.",00:05:45.390,00:05:48.080
"This was very marginal, but well
attended, and this was, for the first",00:05:48.080,00:05:53.850
"time in consumer hands, a
reprogrammable machine.",00:05:53.850,00:05:59.630
You get your Apple II.,00:05:59.630,00:06:00.990
"You turn it on after hooking it up to,
yes, your television set, and you get",00:06:00.990,00:06:06.570
a blinking cursor.,00:06:06.570,00:06:09.120
"And it's up to you to figure
out what to do.",00:06:09.120,00:06:12.010
"When you get the Apple II out of
the box, it is a door stop.",00:06:12.010,00:06:15.250
"It's only when you do such things
as 10, print hello.",00:06:15.250,00:06:19.080
"20, go to 10, that fun really begins.",00:06:19.080,00:06:23.700
"&gt;&gt; And you had lots and lots of people
stepping forward to program their",00:06:23.700,00:06:29.160
"personal computers, intended
as hobbyist machines.",00:06:29.160,00:06:31.990
"Within two years you had Dan Bricklin
and Bob Frankston of the Boston area,",00:06:31.990,00:06:37.320
"programming the first digital
spreadsheet ever, VisiCalc.",00:06:37.320,00:06:42.000
"And suddenly, businesses the nation
over were like, oh my god,",00:06:42.000,00:06:46.760
spreadsheets.,00:06:46.760,00:06:48.120
"And they started buying
Apple II computers.",00:06:48.120,00:06:50.370
"They are flying off the shelves, and
Apple had to do market research to",00:06:50.370,00:06:53.790
"figure out why this thing
was so popular.",00:06:53.790,00:06:56.380
"&gt;&gt; That's what makes this an
unowned technology.",00:06:56.380,00:06:59.210
"You didn't buy it from Apple, but Apple
expects you or Bob Frankston or",00:06:59.210,00:07:03.055
or somebody to program it later.,00:07:03.055,00:07:05.410
"And if your Apple doesn't spreadsheet
the way you want, it's not clear that",00:07:05.410,00:07:09.930
it's Apple's fault.,00:07:09.930,00:07:11.200
"It is unowned in that it accepts
contributions from anybody with the",00:07:11.200,00:07:16.160
"moxie and skill to program it, who
can then share that program",00:07:16.160,00:07:20.660
with anybody else.,00:07:20.660,00:07:22.580
"And that model became the model
for all that followed.",00:07:22.580,00:07:26.880
"&gt;&gt; This is Bill Gates two years after he
dropped out of Harvard, and he was",00:07:26.880,00:07:30.840
"pulled over for a traffic stop
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.",00:07:30.840,00:07:34.480
"You can see the fashion
was different then.",00:07:34.480,00:07:37.050
"And he does have a smile on his face,
somehow knowing that he can buy and",00:07:37.050,00:07:41.310
sell us all someday.,00:07:41.310,00:07:43.260
"And he was able to take what Jobs did
and put it into, maybe, MS-DOS or",00:07:43.260,00:07:50.040
"later, Windows.",00:07:50.040,00:07:51.130
"&gt;&gt; But basically, this format, which is,
you give this thing code, it may start",00:07:51.130,00:07:57.090
"with the blinking cursor, but
then it will run the code.",00:07:57.090,00:08:00.490
"And that was true on many
PCs until recently.",00:08:00.490,00:08:04.800
And it was true then.,00:08:04.800,00:08:06.050
This thing is probably around 1992.,00:08:06.050,00:08:08.050
"I place it because of
the 66 light here.",00:08:08.050,00:08:11.580
"It had a button that could alternate
between 66 and 33, which was the speed",00:08:11.580,00:08:17.150
at which the chip inside should run.,00:08:17.150,00:08:19.270
"You may wonder, why not leave
it fast all the time?",00:08:19.270,00:08:22.220
"That's because it would tire the
hamsters out inside if you made it run",00:08:22.220,00:08:26.460
too quickly.,00:08:26.460,00:08:27.430
"And Prince of Persia would
be too fast as well.",00:08:27.430,00:08:30.570
"I see, by the way, they now have hamster
powered paper shredders.",00:08:30.570,00:08:33.960
"So you can put the paper in the top, and
then the hamster runs on the wheel",00:08:33.960,00:08:37.700
"and shreds the paper, and then can
live in the paper afterwards.",00:08:37.700,00:08:41.140
So it's all part of the cycle of life.,00:08:41.140,00:08:43.740
"&gt;&gt; Anyway, these things can run any
code you give it, and that is a",00:08:43.740,00:08:50.140
"fundamental, but still contingent,
piece of the technology.",00:08:50.140,00:08:54.960
It didn't have to be that way.,00:08:54.960,00:08:57.190
"It could have been the Brother Smart
Word Processor, and as people at",00:08:57.190,00:09:01.570
"Brother or their competitors invent new
stuff, they roll it out like any",00:09:01.570,00:09:06.240
consumer product.,00:09:06.240,00:09:07.630
"It's not up to you to put a seventh
blade into your safety razor.",00:09:07.630,00:09:12.110
"We wait for Gillette to say, if
five is good, why not seven?",00:09:12.110,00:09:16.370
"And then we get it, and we buy it.",00:09:16.370,00:09:18.500
&gt;&gt; This is different.,00:09:18.500,00:09:19.800
"With the modern PC revolution, for the
past 30 years, you hand a computer",00:09:19.800,00:09:25.090
"code that you have written or gotten
from somebody else, it",00:09:25.090,00:09:28.250
will run the code.,00:09:28.250,00:09:29.150
And that changes everything.,00:09:29.150,00:09:31.470
"That is what gave rise to the off the
shelf independent software movement.",00:09:31.470,00:09:36.880
"So you could buy a computer for any
purpose, and then use it for any",00:09:36.880,00:09:40.250
number of other purposes.,00:09:40.250,00:09:41.770
"Or your brother could, or your
kid could, or anything else.",00:09:41.770,00:09:45.240
"&gt;&gt; It didn't have to be this way, but it
turned out to be this way, once",00:09:45.240,00:09:49.410
"everybody discovered how many
discoveries could come if you just",00:09:49.410,00:09:54.340
"released the technology blinking cursor
style and figured that the",00:09:54.340,00:09:57.900
world would build cool stuff.,00:09:57.900,00:10:00.710
"So that's, to me, the essence of unowned
technologies, and I just want",00:10:00.710,00:10:06.340
"to emphasize that you don't
have to be this way.",00:10:06.340,00:10:10.090
"If you rewound time and played it back
again, it's not clear to me that we",00:10:10.090,00:10:13.890
"would end up with an unowned technology
at the core of our consumer",00:10:13.890,00:10:20.200
computing experience.,00:10:20.200,00:10:22.490
"&gt;&gt; Now, on the network side, there
was a similar transformation.",00:10:22.490,00:10:26.110
It began in the owned space.,00:10:26.110,00:10:28.110
"AT&amp;T ran the long distance system,
and that was that, and it",00:10:28.110,00:10:33.690
worked pretty well.,00:10:33.690,00:10:34.900
"And the prices were what they were,
and the regulators came",00:10:34.900,00:10:37.270
in to set the prices.,00:10:37.270,00:10:39.020
"And AT&amp;T purported to control
the whole network.",00:10:39.020,00:10:43.310
"So back in the early 20th century,
when an enterprising man invented",00:10:43.310,00:10:47.890
"this, the Hush-A-Phone, it was something
that would go over your",00:10:47.890,00:10:51.710
"telephone handset, so that your person
you were talking to wouldn't hear",00:10:51.710,00:10:56.390
extraneous noise.,00:10:56.390,00:10:57.510
"And no one could hear what you were
saying to your interlocutor.",00:10:57.510,00:11:01.540
"AT&amp;T said no, we must a license that,
because it could damage our network,",00:11:01.540,00:11:07.620
"and they purported to block
people using it.",00:11:07.620,00:11:10.140
"&gt;&gt; This is an era, by the way, in which the
telephones were leased from AT&amp;T.",00:11:10.140,00:11:13.870
"You could not go to the store
and buy a telephone.",00:11:13.870,00:11:16.650
"You had to get it from your telephone
services provider.",00:11:16.650,00:11:20.540
"This went up and down the Federal
Communications Commission.",00:11:20.540,00:11:23.380
"The FCC backed up AT&amp;T. It took a
Supreme Court decision, ultimately, to",00:11:23.380,00:11:29.190
reverse that.,00:11:29.190,00:11:30.260
"And the world was free to have their
phone hushed, but not much else.",00:11:30.260,00:11:35.870
&gt;&gt; That had its own successors.,00:11:35.870,00:11:38.270
"Back in the day-- and I now
mean probably the mid '80s",00:11:38.270,00:11:40.860
into the early '90s--,00:11:40.860,00:11:42.110
there were services like CompuServe.,00:11:42.110,00:11:44.410
"That was going to be the
future of networking.",00:11:44.410,00:11:46.920
"It had competitors, like Prodigy, and
AOL, and the source, and MCI Mail.",00:11:46.920,00:11:51.050
"But you basically paid by the month,
and then you got a rational menu of",00:11:51.050,00:11:55.030
things you might want to do.,00:11:55.030,00:11:56.980
Where you want to go today?,00:11:56.980,00:11:58.480
"&gt;&gt; But this menu was produced
by CompuServe.",00:11:58.480,00:12:01.340
"If there was going to be something new
on it, you'd get it from CompuServe.",00:12:01.340,00:12:05.070
"And if somebody out there was like,
I think there should be a VisiCalc",00:12:05.070,00:12:07.860
"button, you'd better persuade CompuServe
of its worth, or it would",00:12:07.860,00:12:11.620
"never be accessible to somebody
using the service.",00:12:11.620,00:12:14.910
"So that's an example of the IBM 360 or
the Flexowriter model of technology",00:12:14.910,00:12:20.210
for networking.,00:12:20.210,00:12:21.990
"That gets blown out of the water,
unexpectedly to almost everybody in",00:12:21.990,00:12:27.380
"the field, by this academic research
network known as the internet.",00:12:27.380,00:12:32.240
"&gt;&gt; Here are three of the founders, pictured
here, of the internet--",00:12:32.240,00:12:35.630
"classmates, it turns out, at Van
Nuys High School in California.",00:12:35.630,00:12:39.770
"There's Jon Postel and Steve Crocker and
Vint Cerf, showing at their 25th",00:12:39.770,00:12:44.770
"anniversary retrospective picture for
Newsweek that you can build a network",00:12:44.770,00:12:48.300
out of pretty much anything.,00:12:48.300,00:12:49.920
"Although, as you'll see, their
network doesn't work.",00:12:49.920,00:12:51.800
"It goes from his ear to his ear, and
mouth to mouth, which I hope is an",00:12:51.800,00:12:56.340
"inside joke, rather than the founders
of the internet don't know how to",00:12:56.340,00:12:59.160
string tin cans together.,00:12:59.160,00:13:01.130
"But you can see that they built a
network because they didn't have a lot",00:13:01.130,00:13:06.760
"of money and couldn't roll it out
FedEx style, with lots of people",00:13:06.760,00:13:11.290
working for them.,00:13:11.290,00:13:13.580
"And because they weren't intending to
make any money from it, they built a",00:13:13.580,00:13:18.180
"network that was unowned, whose points
would be respectively owned or",00:13:18.180,00:13:23.470
"operated by who knows who, and maybe
there would even be piggybacking.",00:13:23.470,00:13:27.820
"MIT would piggyback on BBN to get its
packets going back and forth.",00:13:27.820,00:13:33.780
"&gt;&gt; But unowned as a total thing-- what they
built were protocols to put the",00:13:33.780,00:13:38.550
"internet together in a way
that there was no CEO.",00:13:38.550,00:13:43.000
There was no main menu.,00:13:43.000,00:13:45.010
It just is.,00:13:45.010,00:13:46.670
"And it's such an unusual way of doing
it, both in methodology and in",00:13:46.670,00:13:50.150
"substance, that for many years, IBM
was fond of saying you couldn't",00:13:50.150,00:13:53.560
"possibly build a corporate
network using TCP/IP.",00:13:53.560,00:13:57.160
"And that's why internet engineers say
that their mascot would be the",00:13:57.160,00:13:59.820
"bumblebee, because the fur to wingspan
ratio of the bumblebee is far too",00:13:59.820,00:14:03.850
"large for it to be able to fly, and
yet, miraculously, the bee flies.",00:14:03.850,00:14:08.270
"It turns out that we finally discovered
how bees fly in 2006,",00:14:08.270,00:14:12.350
thanks to massive government funding.,00:14:12.350,00:14:14.200
"It turns out they flap their
wings very quickly.",00:14:14.200,00:14:18.720
"&gt;&gt; So the way the internet works is kind of
like the way the beer finds its way",00:14:18.720,00:14:25.670
around in Fenway Park.,00:14:25.670,00:14:27.510
"Somebody asked for a beer, but there's
no beer distribution limit network",00:14:27.510,00:14:33.470
down to the last foot or so.,00:14:33.470,00:14:35.560
"For that, the person has to hand the
beer to the toddler sitting on the",00:14:35.560,00:14:39.190
"end, who then passes it over.",00:14:39.190,00:14:40.970
"And at risk to each of our trousers, we
do this because we stand together",00:14:40.970,00:14:46.620
to let the fun flow.,00:14:46.620,00:14:49.070
"And that's basically the way packet
networking works on the internet,",00:14:49.070,00:14:52.690
"where there are entities on the internet
handling your packets, as you",00:14:52.690,00:14:56.270
"get them relayed from one point to
another, who have no contractual",00:14:56.270,00:14:59.750
"relationship with you, nor with
the ultimate destination.",00:14:59.750,00:15:03.260
"It's like nested matryoshka
dolls, how it goes around.",00:15:03.260,00:15:07.850
"&gt;&gt; The basic format is this, and you may
have learned a little bit about it.",00:15:07.850,00:15:11.110
"It's called hourglass architecture,
and it says that you put not",00:15:11.110,00:15:14.740
"intellectual property, but internet
protocol, in the middle of the",00:15:14.740,00:15:17.480
hourglass here.,00:15:17.480,00:15:18.230
"That's what the engineers work on,
and it's designed to be totally",00:15:18.230,00:15:21.690
"ecumenical, which is why it's broad
on the top and the bottom.",00:15:21.690,00:15:25.130
"At the top, we allow any
number of applications.",00:15:25.130,00:15:30.670
"Who knows what somebody's
going to build on it.",00:15:30.670,00:15:32.650
It's just like a blinking cursor.,00:15:32.650,00:15:34.650
"&gt;&gt; The internet is just designed to take
points of presence and route packets",00:15:34.650,00:15:38.060
between them using best efforts.,00:15:38.060,00:15:39.990
That's it.,00:15:39.990,00:15:41.316
That's It.,00:15:41.316,00:15:42.140
It's not a set of applications.,00:15:42.140,00:15:44.210
It's just the network.,00:15:44.210,00:15:45.550
"And then anybody can build applications
on top of it, and may the",00:15:45.550,00:15:48.660
best apps win.,00:15:48.660,00:15:49.940
"And underneath, it was meant
to be ecumenical about what",00:15:49.940,00:15:52.630
hardware you would use.,00:15:52.630,00:15:54.100
"Whatever hardware you
want to use, boom.",00:15:54.100,00:15:56.260
"You can bring it to the party, so long
as it speaks internet protocol.",00:15:56.260,00:15:59.970

internet protocol, and as changes are",00:15:59.970,00:16:03.920
"made to it, you're free
to adopt them or not.",00:16:03.920,00:16:07.130
"As an equipment manufacturer or as a
network provider, it is, in fact, a",00:16:07.130,00:16:11.080
"collective hallucination, but a very
sustained and powerful one.",00:16:11.080,00:16:15.780
"&gt;&gt; And the idea was, don't make
the network smart.",00:16:15.780,00:16:18.930
Don't keep adding features.,00:16:18.930,00:16:20.310

paper clip phase of the internet.",00:16:20.310,00:16:24.120

added many features to it.",00:16:24.120,00:16:28.160
"Instead, it's just supposed to
route and let the endpoints--",00:16:28.160,00:16:32.460
the smart things on the end like PCs--,00:16:32.460,00:16:35.290

as encryption, such as return receipt,",00:16:35.290,00:16:40.670

be only if you need them.",00:16:40.670,00:16:44.890

opposite of AT&amp;T or CompuServe.,00:18:37.360,00:18:41.740

around 1995 or so, when Windows, which",00:18:41.740,00:18:49.840

at other layers.",00:20:55.670,00:20:58.990

that cool thing can become a problem.,00:21:32.110,00:21:35.880

to an unowned zone.",00:21:42.590,00:21:46.210

instances of those sorts of things",00:22:20.640,00:22:24.570

an entrepreneurial story.",00:22:30.750,00:22:33.150

just do the best you can to",00:30:27.290,00:30:30.930

"It basically said digital Pearl

former CIA director George Tenet,",00:33:06.680,00:33:10.660
"who said that, maybe we have
to make it so that people--",00:33:10.660,00:33:18.170
"the access to the web might need to be
limited to those who show they can",00:33:18.170,00:33:20.900

"It would no longer be
a world wide web.",00:33:22.980,00:33:24.600
"It would be like, three people being
like, we are very secure.",00:33:24.600,00:33:28.460
"And that's one of the problems in
trying to figure out what to do.",00:33:28.460,00:33:32.620
"&gt;&gt; And just a couple years ago, there was
this big thing about, oh my god, they",00:33:32.620,00:33:35.870
"have a cybersecurity bill, and the
president's going to have emergency",00:33:35.870,00:33:39.100
power to shut down the internet.,00:33:39.100,00:33:41.350
"I don't think that amounted
to much of anything.",00:33:41.350,00:33:44.040
"And in fact the lawmakers themselves
were not pleased with these reports of",00:33:44.040,00:33:46.970
the kill switch.,00:33:46.970,00:33:47.930
"Although it doesn't make me feel better
that, as you can see at the",00:33:47.930,00:33:52.760
"bottom, the senator was like, the
president already has the authority to",00:33:52.760,00:33:55.900
"shut down the internet under a
little-known provision of the",00:33:55.900,00:33:58.570
"Communications Act passed one month
after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor,",00:33:58.570,00:34:03.100
"which is a very forward-looking law,
to give the president the power to",00:34:03.100,00:34:06.720
"shut down the internet after the
Japanese attacked in 1941.",00:34:06.720,00:34:10.780
"&gt;&gt; Anyway, we start to see other ways that
government is trying to think of",00:34:10.780,00:34:15.560
"this like the government would
think of any other form of",00:34:15.560,00:34:18.560
intrusion into a space.,00:34:18.560,00:34:20.139
"And that's one of the negatives of
calling it cyberspace, because it's",00:34:20.139,00:34:23.020
not really a space.,00:34:23.020,00:34:23.865
But we think of perimeter defense.,00:34:23.865,00:34:25.860
"Of just like, well let's just put
antivirus nodes all around the edges",00:34:25.860,00:34:30.360
"of the country, and they can
shoot down incoming viruses",00:34:30.360,00:34:33.510
like missile command.,00:34:33.510,00:34:34.810
And it doesn't quite work that way.,00:34:34.810,00:34:37.550
"And it means, instead, that we may end
up building a system to shoot down all",00:34:37.550,00:34:41.330
"sorts of other content that has nothing
to do with network security.",00:34:41.330,00:34:45.540
It's not clear.,00:34:45.540,00:34:46.639
"We want to take a page out of the
books of countries that have",00:34:46.639,00:34:49.100
already done that.,00:34:49.100,00:34:51.040
"&gt;&gt; In the meantime, we've seen proposals
from some multinational",00:34:51.040,00:34:54.480
"multigovernment institutions, like the
International Telecommunications",00:34:54.480,00:34:57.440
"Union, to completely
redo the internet.",00:34:57.440,00:35:00.350
"As you can see, they are an extremely
hierarchical organization, kind of the",00:35:00.350,00:35:03.860
"opposite of the three guys who
started the internet off.",00:35:03.860,00:35:07.260
"And they have this idea of replacing the
hourglass was what they call the",00:35:07.260,00:35:12.440
next generation network.,00:35:12.440,00:35:15.180
"And they started a focus group on the
next generation networks, also known",00:35:15.180,00:35:18.550
as the FGNGN.,00:35:18.550,00:35:19.870
"And it came up with a new map
for a better tomorrow.",00:35:19.870,00:35:24.270
&gt;&gt; You ready for the new hourglass?,00:35:24.270,00:35:26.040
Here it is.,00:35:26.040,00:35:27.200
"It's ITU next generation network, and
it has everything but the animated",00:35:27.200,00:35:32.010
paper clip.,00:35:32.010,00:35:32.770
"Suddenly it's feature laden in the
network, because the idea should be,",00:35:32.770,00:35:36.880
"they figure, that you want to be able to
make it, if packet says don't copy",00:35:36.880,00:35:41.200
"me, even if two users want to exchange
it, the network should",00:35:41.200,00:35:44.630
know not to do it.,00:35:44.630,00:35:45.860
"That could help with content control,
and that could help with security.",00:35:45.860,00:35:50.610
"It doesn't, I think, end up mattering
that much, because trying to replace",00:35:50.610,00:35:53.875
"the network we have is really
difficult to do.",00:35:53.875,00:35:56.570
It has a lot of inertia to it.,00:35:56.570,00:35:58.410
"Just ask the internet engineers who are
trying to upgrade it themselves.",00:35:58.410,00:36:02.750
"&gt;&gt; So a third quadrant here
is the upper right.",00:36:02.750,00:36:06.800
"And it's still owned,
but it's polyarchy.",00:36:06.800,00:36:09.120
"There's lots of owners,
and you get your pick.",00:36:09.120,00:36:11.220
That's basically the corporate sector.,00:36:11.220,00:36:13.170
"It's turning to the corporate world
to say, I've got a problem.",00:36:13.170,00:36:17.090
Sell me a solution.,00:36:17.090,00:36:18.180
I'm not looking for government.,00:36:18.180,00:36:19.380
I can't do it myself.,00:36:19.380,00:36:20.840
"But you could maybe come
up with something.",00:36:20.840,00:36:23.300
"And sure enough, we've seen lots of
efforts by private companies to secure",00:36:23.300,00:36:27.350
"the space, which in turn sometimes
end up in trouble.",00:36:27.350,00:36:31.480
&gt;&gt; Is that RSA calling?,00:36:31.480,00:36:32.730
I hear a weird beep.,00:36:32.730,00:36:34.441
I guess not.,00:36:34.441,00:36:35.760
"&gt;&gt; Anyway, it turns out, then, that the
corporate sector tries to offer some",00:36:35.760,00:36:42.170
"measure of security, but it has the
feel, metaphorically, of securing the",00:36:42.170,00:36:45.320
"road from the Baghdad airport with
your own bodyguard force.",00:36:45.320,00:36:49.060
"It has its element of inefficiency to
it, and it means that different people",00:36:49.060,00:36:53.240
"will get different levels of security,
which can end up not",00:36:53.240,00:36:56.790
being all that fair.,00:36:56.790,00:36:58.410
"&gt;&gt; In a more subtle sense, we've seen the
introduction of technologies made to",00:36:58.410,00:37:03.340
be in the mold of the Flexowriter.,00:37:03.340,00:37:05.950
"In fact, the very company that in 1977
gave us the first great unowned",00:37:05.950,00:37:10.190
"technology, the PC, gave us the first
great owned technology exactly 30",00:37:10.190,00:37:15.220
"years later, with the iPhone, where the
iPhone says, look, we are going to",00:37:15.220,00:37:20.470
define everything on it.,00:37:20.470,00:37:21.840
You don't want to be like a PC.,00:37:21.840,00:37:23.030
Those crash all the time.,00:37:23.030,00:37:24.740
"Instead what you want is to be able to
have it work, have it act just like",00:37:24.740,00:37:31.930
that Smart Word Processor.,00:37:31.930,00:37:33.960
Now that was the original iPhone.,00:37:33.960,00:37:35.550
"There were no apps, no App Store
on the original iPhone.",00:37:35.550,00:37:39.900
"It was more just like basically saying,
look, we're going to close it",00:37:39.900,00:37:44.300
"off, and this is going to look
like something some of",00:37:44.300,00:37:47.190
you have seen before.,00:37:47.190,00:37:48.570
"And we will define what
goes on the phone.",00:37:48.570,00:37:51.280
"&gt;&gt; Now, that changed when, a couple years
later, they introduced the software",00:37:51.280,00:37:56.250
"developers kit, and suddenly third
parties could code for the iPhone.",00:37:56.250,00:38:01.440
And that includes you.,00:38:01.440,00:38:03.210
This is not a real Newsweek cover.,00:38:03.210,00:38:04.820
"In fact, it's not clear to me
Newsweek exists anymore.",00:38:04.820,00:38:07.480
"But anyway, it's just a bad
dream, the whole thing.",00:38:07.480,00:38:11.410
"&gt;&gt; It turns out, though, that they
put an extra tweak in.",00:38:11.410,00:38:14.780
it's not like VisiCalc.,00:38:14.780,00:38:16.040
"If you invent something that's going to
run on somebody's iPhone, and you",00:38:16.040,00:38:19.300
"want to give it to them, and they want
to take it, it must go through the App",00:38:19.300,00:38:22.520
"Store, which in turn says, we're not
going to allow illegal, malicious,",00:38:22.520,00:38:26.280
"privacy invading, porn, bandwidth
hog, or my favorite, unforeseen.",00:38:26.280,00:38:31.000
"We can't have anything unforeseen
happening on the iPhone.",00:38:31.000,00:38:35.820
"And that App Store model is responding
to a very real and pressing problem in",00:38:35.820,00:38:41.590
the unowned universe.,00:38:41.590,00:38:43.160
"But it's a solution that comes
with its own worries.",00:38:43.160,00:38:46.610
"&gt;&gt; So, for example, when a guy created
something called Freedom Time,",00:38:46.610,00:38:51.830
"counting down the end of George W.
Bush's term, it was rejected",00:38:51.830,00:38:55.880
from the App Store.,00:38:55.880,00:38:57.760
"And he actually wrote a note to Steve
Jobs asking why it had been rejected.",00:38:57.760,00:39:02.200
"Steve Jobs wrote back and said, this
is going to be offensive to roughly",00:39:02.200,00:39:05.870
half our customers.,00:39:05.870,00:39:06.830
What's the point?,00:39:06.830,00:39:08.340
"And you realize that people are now
walking around with their technology.",00:39:08.340,00:39:13.050
They may want it.,00:39:13.050,00:39:13.830
You may want to give it to them.,00:39:13.830,00:39:15.070
"But somebody in the middle has
to be persuaded of its worth",00:39:15.070,00:39:19.300
before allowing it.,00:39:19.300,00:39:20.460
"&gt;&gt; That's a very different technological
environment.",00:39:20.460,00:39:23.410
"And it's one that Steve Jobs
accurately foresaw.",00:39:23.410,00:39:26.550
It's not just about mobile phones.,00:39:26.550,00:39:28.570
"This is coming to all
our technologies.",00:39:28.570,00:39:31.290
"And indeed, we've started to see hybrids
and other ways in which our",00:39:31.290,00:39:36.290
"own PC architecture is
now App Store driven.",00:39:36.290,00:39:40.250
"&gt;&gt; This is now like, we take
it for granted.",00:39:40.250,00:39:42.260
"Two years ago, it would have been, I'm
not so sure that's going to happen.",00:39:42.260,00:39:45.310
"And years before that, it would have
been insane to suggest such a thing.",00:39:45.310,00:39:49.540
"And, of course, the other day
I tried to load this--",00:39:49.540,00:39:51.690
"I don't even know what it does,
this thing called Vuze.",00:39:51.690,00:39:53.890
Anybody familiar with it?,00:39:53.890,00:39:55.220
"Anyway, I tried to load it on my
Mac, and I said, no, no, sorry.",00:39:55.220,00:40:00.390

want to do that?",00:40:09.490,00:40:12.300

just Apple doing that now.",00:40:12.300,00:40:16.580

"&gt;&gt; So, for example, some of you may
remember the old OnStar system.",00:45:06.380,00:45:10.530
It was in your car.,00:45:10.530,00:45:11.390
"You'd be driving around, and you get
lost or something, and you press the",00:45:11.390,00:45:14.220
button in the rearview mirror.,00:45:14.220,00:45:16.320
"It has a little microphone so you can
speak right into it, and speakers so",00:45:16.320,00:45:19.120
you can hear what people say back.,00:45:19.120,00:45:21.120

you press the help button.",00:45:21.120,00:45:23.420

"And she's like, well,
help is on the way.",00:45:25.650,00:45:28.450
"&gt;&gt; And then it turns out that the FBI
ends up going to an OnStar like",00:45:28.450,00:45:33.380
"company and says, I want you, for this
car, to simply turn on the microphone,",00:45:33.380,00:45:38.120
"and listen to everything going
on in the car at all times.",00:45:38.120,00:45:41.300
"And the company was like, uhh.",00:45:41.300,00:45:42.980
"And they're like, that's what
you're going to do.",00:45:42.980,00:45:44.790
We're the FBI.,00:45:44.790,00:45:46.120
"The company said OK, and then sued
anonymously, leading to this wonderful",00:45:46.120,00:45:49.510
"case, The Company v. United States of
America, in which, it turned out,",00:45:49.510,00:45:55.280
"then, that this was not permitted under
the Wiretap Act for the thinnest",00:45:55.280,00:45:59.670
of reasons.,00:45:59.670,00:46:00.310
"Which namely was the way the FBI asked
for it to happen, to be implemented.",00:46:00.310,00:46:04.560
"If the person asked for help because
they were really in trouble, it would",00:46:04.560,00:46:07.690
"still only go to the FBI, rather than
OnStar, or that company, which",00:46:07.690,00:46:11.510
presumably would not come and help.,00:46:11.510,00:46:13.410
"But if you could fix that glitch, you
would be in a position to change the",00:46:13.410,00:46:18.560

that's today.",00:46:32.130,00:46:36.150

the environment of the System/360.",00:46:36.150,00:46:40.870
"You don't own your stuff anymore,
and that is a real problem.",00:46:40.870,00:46:46.310

"Well, I'm going to give you some ideas
in the next 4 and 1/2 minutes.",00:46:48.090,00:46:52.270
"So, one possibility is to return to
these very unowned technologies and",00:46:52.270,00:46:57.940
"look for new means of defense
in this quadrant.",00:46:57.940,00:47:01.600
"Coming in an unowned fashion, but so
powerful, so persuasive, so widely",00:47:01.600,00:47:06.220

that the criminals can't easily opt",00:47:06.220,00:47:10.400

discovered, in that any administrator",00:47:14.090,00:47:17.560
"of Wikipedia can be making changes to
Wikipedia in a privileged way, but",00:47:17.560,00:47:22.610
"still in this kind of distributed,
unowned fashion, in order to try to",00:47:22.610,00:47:26.770
make for a better encyclopedia.,00:47:26.770,00:47:29.190

"&gt;&gt; And I'll just give you some examples
of unowned but powerful--",00:47:48.910,00:47:52.550
"so powerful they move to the left on
that chart-- technologies like Tor,",00:47:52.550,00:47:57.050
"where, with enough computers together,
you can end up laundering the source",00:47:57.050,00:48:01.170
"and destination of packets, so the
something like the Silk Road could be",00:48:01.170,00:48:04.170

click away, for months at a time.",00:48:04.170,00:48:08.620

trying to put out a hit on one of his",00:48:08.620,00:48:12.080
"vendors for the cops to be
able to find this person.",00:48:12.080,00:48:15.270
That's pretty incredible.,00:48:15.270,00:48:17.080
"For better or worse, this is an example
of a technology, then, that",00:48:17.080,00:48:20.410
"defies a certain kind of OnStar
like surveillance.",00:48:20.410,00:48:23.660
"At the content layer, we see things like
Ushahidi, which allow people to",00:48:23.660,00:48:27.200
"immediately throw up a map and make
reports of things, so after an",00:48:27.200,00:48:30.550

become quite reliable.,00:48:41.220,00:48:44.320
"&gt;&gt; This is an idea that we're pursuing over
at the Berkman Center, in which",00:48:44.320,00:48:47.520
"currently, if you try to access a web
page, it renders some links, and you",00:48:47.520,00:48:51.370
"click on one of those links and try
to go where the link points.",00:48:51.370,00:48:54.310
"If you can't get there, that's it.",00:48:54.310,00:48:56.200
You're stuck.,00:48:56.200,00:48:57.250
"Well, what if we made it so that when
you visit a page, it has already",00:48:57.250,00:49:02.540
"cached some of the links
that point elsewhere?",00:49:02.540,00:49:05.300
"It's taken a copy from that server to
itself, so that if you go to the",00:49:05.300,00:49:09.370
"server and you can't get there, you can
go back to the place where you got",00:49:09.370,00:49:13.500
"the link, and it will send
you what you missed.",00:49:13.500,00:49:15.890

defensive system that could take some",00:49:15.890,00:49:20.080
"of the sting out of distributed
denial of service attacks.",00:49:20.080,00:49:23.250

filtering, this system would be a",00:49:26.050,00:49:29.460

And why didn't it work?,00:50:36.160,00:50:37.670
"Because there was not centralized
law enforcement in any big way.",00:50:37.670,00:50:42.360
"If you needed to find somebody or do
anything that was bigger than a single",00:50:42.360,00:50:46.460
