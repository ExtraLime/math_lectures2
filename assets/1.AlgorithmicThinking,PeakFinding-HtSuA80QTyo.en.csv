PROFESSOR: Hi.,00:00:22.730,00:00:23.390
I'm Srini Devadas.,00:00:23.390,00:00:24.750

"PROFESSOR: And we
hope you're going",00:00:38.650,00:00:40.210
"to have a fun time
in 6.006 learning",00:00:40.210,00:00:43.710
a variety of algorithms.,00:00:43.710,00:00:45.760
"What I want to do today is
spend literally a minute or so",00:00:45.760,00:00:50.760
"on administrative
details, maybe even less.",00:00:50.760,00:00:55.004
"What I'd like to
do is to tell you",00:00:55.004,00:00:56.420
"to go to the website that's
listed up there and read it.",00:00:56.420,00:01:00.670
"And you'll get all
information you",00:01:00.670,00:01:02.250
"need about what this class
is about from a standpoint",00:01:02.250,00:01:06.430
"of syllabus; what's expected
of you; the problem set",00:01:06.430,00:01:11.590
"schedule; the quiz schedule;
and so on and so forth.",00:01:11.590,00:01:15.660
"I want to dive right in and tell
you about interesting things,",00:01:15.660,00:01:19.460
"like algorithms and
complexity of algorithms.",00:01:19.460,00:01:24.550
"I want to spend
some time giving you",00:01:24.550,00:01:26.490
"an overview of the
course content.",00:01:26.490,00:01:29.380
"And then we're
going to dive right",00:01:29.380,00:01:31.640
"in and look at a
particular problem of peak",00:01:31.640,00:01:35.230
"finding-- both the one
dimensional version and a two",00:01:35.230,00:01:38.360
"dimensional version-- and
talk about algorithms to solve",00:01:38.360,00:01:41.900
"this peak finding problem--
both varieties of it.",00:01:41.900,00:01:46.670
"And you'll find
that there's really",00:01:46.670,00:01:50.000
"a difference between
these various algorithms",00:01:50.000,00:01:53.090
"that we'll look at in
terms of their complexity.",00:01:53.090,00:01:56.480
"And what I mean
by that is you're",00:01:56.480,00:01:59.070
"going to have different run
times of these algorithms",00:01:59.070,00:02:02.750
"depending on input
size, based on how",00:02:02.750,00:02:06.210
efficient these algorithms are.,00:02:06.210,00:02:08.600
"And a prerequisite for
this class is 6.042.",00:02:08.600,00:02:14.370
"And in 6.042 you learned
about asymptotic complexity.",00:02:14.370,00:02:18.620
"And you'll see that
in this lecture",00:02:18.620,00:02:21.240
"we'll analyze relatively
simple algorithms today",00:02:21.240,00:02:25.430
"in terms of their
asymptotic complexity.",00:02:25.430,00:02:28.070
"And you'll be able
to compare and say",00:02:28.070,00:02:30.340
"that this algorithm is fasten
this other one-- assuming",00:02:30.340,00:02:33.940
"that you have large
inputs-- because it's",00:02:33.940,00:02:37.320
asymptotically less complex.,00:02:37.320,00:02:40.840
"So let's dive right in
and talk about the class.",00:02:40.840,00:02:43.185
"So the one sentence
summary of this class",00:02:52.420,00:02:54.550
"is that this is about
efficient procedures",00:02:54.550,00:02:58.910
"for solving problems
on large inputs.",00:02:58.910,00:03:04.850
"And when I say large
inputs, I mean things",00:03:04.850,00:03:06.800
"like the US highway
system, a map",00:03:06.800,00:03:10.720
"of all of the highways
in the United States;",00:03:10.720,00:03:14.110
"the human genome, which
has a billion letters",00:03:14.110,00:03:17.850
"in its alphabet; a social
network responding to Facebook,",00:03:17.850,00:03:23.170
"that I guess has 500
million nodes or so.",00:03:23.170,00:03:26.840
So these are large inputs.,00:03:26.840,00:03:28.280
"Now our definition of large has
really changed with the times.",00:03:28.280,00:03:31.470
"And so really the 21st
century definition of large",00:03:31.470,00:03:35.440
"is, I guess, a trillion.",00:03:35.440,00:03:36.971
Right?,00:03:36.971,00:03:37.470
"Back when I was your age
large was like 1,000.",00:03:37.470,00:03:40.680
[LAUGHTER],00:03:40.680,00:03:42.400
I guess I'm dating myself here.,00:03:42.400,00:03:44.844
"Back when Eric was your
age, it was a million.",00:03:44.844,00:03:46.760
Right?,00:03:46.760,00:03:47.260
[LAUGHTER],00:03:47.260,00:03:48.650
"But what's happening really
the world is moving faster,",00:03:48.650,00:03:55.000
things are getting bigger.,00:03:55.000,00:03:56.420
"We have the capability of
computing on large inputs,",00:03:56.420,00:04:00.880
"but that doesn't
mean that efficiency",00:04:00.880,00:04:03.220
isn't of paramount concern.,00:04:03.220,00:04:05.760
"The fact of matter is
that you can, maybe,",00:04:05.760,00:04:08.690
"scan a billion elements
in a matter of seconds.",00:04:08.690,00:04:13.550
"But if you had an algorithm
that required cubic complexity,",00:04:13.550,00:04:17.750
"suddenly you're not talking
about 10 raised to 9,",00:04:17.750,00:04:19.899
"you're talking about
10 raised to 27.",00:04:19.899,00:04:22.079
"And even current
computers can't really",00:04:22.079,00:04:24.510
"handle those kinds of numbers,
so efficiency is a concern.",00:04:24.510,00:04:30.890
"And as inputs get larger, it
becomes more of a concern.",00:04:30.890,00:04:34.820
All right?,00:04:34.820,00:04:35.320
So we're concerned about--,00:04:35.320,00:04:39.398
"--efficient procedures-- for
solving large scale problems",00:04:43.760,00:04:51.310
in this class.,00:04:51.310,00:04:51.940
"And we're concerned
about scalability,",00:04:58.140,00:05:01.640
"because-- just as,
you know, 1,000",00:05:01.640,00:05:07.030
"was a big number a
couple of decades ago,",00:05:07.030,00:05:09.600
"and now it's kind of
a small number-- it's",00:05:09.600,00:05:12.140
"quite possible that by the
time you guys are professors",00:05:12.140,00:05:16.430
"teaching this class
in some university",00:05:16.430,00:05:18.220
"that a trillion is going
to be a small number.",00:05:18.220,00:05:20.690
"And we're going to be talking
about-- I don't know--",00:05:20.690,00:05:24.430
"10 raised to 18
as being something",00:05:24.430,00:05:27.520
"that we're concerned with from
a standpoint of a common case",00:05:27.520,00:05:32.620
input for an algorithm.,00:05:32.620,00:05:34.510
So scalability is important.,00:05:34.510,00:05:38.120
"And we want to be able to track
how our algorithms are going",00:05:38.120,00:05:41.480
"to do as inputs get
larger and larger.",00:05:41.480,00:05:44.000
"You going to learn a bunch
of different data structures.",00:05:47.210,00:05:52.180
"We'll call them classic
data structures,",00:05:52.180,00:05:56.650
"like binary search
trees, hash tables-- that",00:05:56.650,00:06:01.450
"are called dictionaries
in Python-- and data",00:06:01.450,00:06:06.020
"structures-- such as balanced
binary search trees-- that",00:06:06.020,00:06:09.470
"are more efficient than just
the regular binary search trees.",00:06:09.470,00:06:12.975
"And these are all
data structures",00:06:12.975,00:06:14.350
"that were invented
many decades ago.",00:06:14.350,00:06:18.540
"But they've stood
the test of time,",00:06:18.540,00:06:20.850
and they continue to be useful.,00:06:20.850,00:06:23.530
"We're going to augment these
data structures in various ways",00:06:23.530,00:06:26.210
"to make them more efficient
for certain kinds of problems.",00:06:26.210,00:06:30.330
"And while you're not going to be
doing a whole lot of algorithm",00:06:30.330,00:06:33.980
"design in this
class, you will be",00:06:33.980,00:06:36.180
"doing some design and a
whole lot of analysis.",00:06:36.180,00:06:38.335
"The class following this
one, 6.046 Designing Analysis",00:06:40.880,00:06:46.060
"of Algorithms, is
a class that you",00:06:46.060,00:06:48.530
"should take if
you like this one.",00:06:48.530,00:06:52.080
"And you can do a whole lot more
design of algorithms in 6.046.",00:06:52.080,00:06:57.180
"But you will look at
classic data structures",00:06:57.180,00:06:59.880
"and classical algorithms
for these data structures,",00:06:59.880,00:07:06.260
"including things like sorting
and matching, and so on.",00:07:06.260,00:07:12.470
"And one of the nice
things about this class",00:07:12.470,00:07:17.200
"is that you'll be doing real
implementations of these data",00:07:17.200,00:07:21.800
"structures and
algorithms in Python.",00:07:21.800,00:07:25.130
"And in particular are
each of the problem",00:07:28.220,00:07:30.880
"sets in this class are
going to have both a theory",00:07:30.880,00:07:38.680
"part to them, and a
programming part to them.",00:07:38.680,00:07:41.930
"So hopefully it'll
all tie together.",00:07:41.930,00:07:43.430
"The kinds of things we're going
to be talking about in lectures",00:07:43.430,00:07:46.060
"and recitations are going
to be directly connected",00:07:46.060,00:07:51.200
"to the theory parts
of the problem sets.",00:07:51.200,00:07:53.260
"And you'll be programming the
algorithms that we talk about",00:07:53.260,00:07:55.800
"in lecture, or augmenting
them, running them.",00:07:55.800,00:07:58.680
"Figuring out whether they work
well on large inputs or not.",00:07:58.680,00:08:03.180
"So let me talk a little
bit about the modules",00:08:06.510,00:08:09.530
"in this class and
the problem sets.",00:08:09.530,00:08:11.462
"And we hope that
these problem sets",00:08:11.462,00:08:12.920
are going to be fun for you.,00:08:12.920,00:08:15.470
And by fun I don't mean easy.,00:08:15.470,00:08:19.430
"I mean challenging and
worthwhile, so at the end of it",00:08:19.430,00:08:22.656
"you feel like you've
learned something,",00:08:22.656,00:08:24.280
"and you had some
fun along the way.",00:08:24.280,00:08:26.870
All right?,00:08:26.870,00:08:28.580
So content wise--,00:08:28.580,00:08:30.550
"--we have eight
modules in the class.",00:08:37.350,00:08:41.830
"Each of which,
roughly speaking, has",00:08:41.830,00:08:44.490
"a problem set
associated with it.",00:08:44.490,00:08:47.020
"The first of these is what
we call algorithmic thinking.",00:08:47.020,00:08:51.950
"And we'll kick start
that one today.",00:08:55.710,00:08:59.130
"We'll look at a particular
problem, as I mentioned,",00:08:59.130,00:09:01.480
of peak finding.,00:09:01.480,00:09:02.790
"And as part of
this, you're going",00:09:02.790,00:09:04.350
"to have a problem set that's
going to go out today as well.",00:09:04.350,00:09:07.960
"And you'll find that
in this problem set",00:09:07.960,00:09:12.320
"some of these algorithms
I talk about today will",00:09:12.320,00:09:14.420
be coded in Python and given to.,00:09:14.420,00:09:17.090
"A couple of them are going
to have bugs in them.",00:09:17.090,00:09:20.190
"You'll have to analyze the
complexity of these algorithms;",00:09:20.190,00:09:24.340
"figure out which ones are
correct and efficient;",00:09:24.340,00:09:27.380
"and write a proof
for one of them.",00:09:27.380,00:09:29.760
All right?,00:09:29.760,00:09:30.260
"So that's sort of an
example problem set.",00:09:30.260,00:09:33.320
"And you can expect that
most of the problem sets",00:09:33.320,00:09:37.600
"are going to follow
that sort of template.",00:09:37.600,00:09:40.036
All right.,00:09:40.036,00:09:40.750
"So you'll get a
better sense of this",00:09:40.750,00:09:44.810
"by the end of the
day today for sure.",00:09:44.810,00:09:46.690
"Or a concrete sense
of this, because we'll",00:09:46.690,00:09:48.930
"be done with lecture and you'll
see your first problem set.",00:09:48.930,00:09:52.850
"We're going to be doing a
module on sorting and trees.",00:09:52.850,00:09:57.540
"Sorting you now about,
sorting a bunch of numbers.",00:09:57.540,00:10:00.619
"Imagine if you had
a trillion numbers",00:10:00.619,00:10:02.160
and you wanted to sort them.,00:10:02.160,00:10:04.250
"What kind of algorithm
could use for that?",00:10:04.250,00:10:07.610
"Trees are a wonderful
data structure.",00:10:07.610,00:10:10.280
"There's different varieties, the
most common being binary trees.",00:10:10.280,00:10:14.760
"And there's ways of doing
all sorts of things,",00:10:14.760,00:10:17.580
"like scheduling, and sorting,
using various kinds of trees,",00:10:17.580,00:10:22.560
including binary trees.,00:10:22.560,00:10:24.200
"And we have a problem set on
simulating a logic network",00:10:24.200,00:10:31.330
"using a particular kind of
sorting algorithm in a data",00:10:31.330,00:10:36.660
structure.,00:10:36.660,00:10:38.340
"That is going to be
your second problem set.",00:10:38.340,00:10:41.150
"And more quickly, we're going
to have modules on hashing,",00:10:41.150,00:10:47.190
"where we do things
like genome comparison.",00:10:47.190,00:10:51.240
"In past terms we compared a
human genome to a rat genome,",00:10:51.240,00:10:56.330
"and discovered they
were pretty similar.",00:10:56.330,00:10:59.350
"99% similar, which
is kind of amazing.",00:10:59.350,00:11:01.860
"But again, these things
are so large that you",00:11:01.860,00:11:04.960
"have to have efficiency
in the comparison methods",00:11:04.960,00:11:07.590
that you use.,00:11:07.590,00:11:08.460
"And you'll find that if you
don't get the complexity low",00:11:08.460,00:11:11.690
"enough, you just won't
be able to complete--",00:11:11.690,00:11:15.300
"your program won't be able to
finish running within the time",00:11:15.300,00:11:19.950
that your problem set is do.,00:11:19.950,00:11:21.260
Right?,00:11:21.260,00:11:21.760
Which is a bit of a problem.,00:11:21.760,00:11:24.660
"So that's something to keep
in mind as you test your code.",00:11:24.660,00:11:28.860
"The fact is that you will get
large inputs to run your code.",00:11:28.860,00:11:32.140
"And you want to keep
complexity in mind",00:11:32.140,00:11:34.960
"as you're coding and thinking
about the pseudocode,",00:11:34.960,00:11:40.070
"if you will, of your
algorithm itself.",00:11:40.070,00:11:43.624

All right.,00:15:20.860,00:15:23.000
OK.,00:15:23.000,00:15:23.870
So let's get started.,00:15:23.870,00:15:26.210
"I want to talk about
a specific problem.",00:15:26.210,00:15:28.930
"And talk about algorithms
for a specific problem.",00:15:28.930,00:15:32.000
"We picked this problem, because
it's so easy to understand.",00:15:32.000,00:15:35.560
"And they're fairly
straightforward algorithms",00:15:35.560,00:15:38.790
"that are not particularly
efficient to solve",00:15:38.790,00:15:41.280
this problem.,00:15:41.280,00:15:42.530
"And so this is a, kind
of, a toy problem.",00:15:42.530,00:15:45.060
"But like a lot of
toy problems, it's",00:15:45.060,00:15:49.660
"very evocative in that it
points out the issues involved",00:15:49.660,00:15:55.230
"in designing
efficient algorithms.",00:15:55.230,00:15:57.739
"So we'll start with
a one dimensional",00:15:57.739,00:15:59.280
"version of what we
call peak finding.",00:15:59.280,00:16:02.395
"And a peak finder is something
in the one dimensional case.",00:16:05.810,00:16:10.635
Runs on an array of numbers.,00:16:14.180,00:16:18.240
And I'm just putting--,00:16:18.240,00:16:22.770
"--symbols for each of
these numbers here.",00:16:22.770,00:16:27.020
"And the numbers are
positive, negative.",00:16:27.020,00:16:31.546
"We'll just assume
they're all positive,",00:16:31.546,00:16:33.170
it doesn't really matter.,00:16:33.170,00:16:34.480
"The algorithms we
describe will work.",00:16:34.480,00:16:38.460
"And so we have this
one dimensional array",00:16:38.460,00:16:41.330
"that has nine
different positions.",00:16:41.330,00:16:43.450
And a through i are numbers.,00:16:43.450,00:16:47.405
And we want to find a peak.,00:16:49.910,00:16:53.030
"And so we have to define
what we mean by a peak.",00:16:53.030,00:16:56.180
"And so, in particular,
as an example,",00:16:56.180,00:17:00.320
"position 2 is a
peak if, and only",00:17:00.320,00:17:07.369
"if, b greater than or equal to
a, and b greater than or equal",00:17:07.369,00:17:16.520
to c.,00:17:16.520,00:17:18.020
"So it's really a very local
property corresponding",00:17:18.020,00:17:21.359
to a peak.,00:17:21.359,00:17:22.270
"In the one dimensional
case, it's trivial.",00:17:22.270,00:17:25.020
Look to your left.,00:17:25.020,00:17:26.220
Look to your right.,00:17:26.220,00:17:27.990
"If you are equal or greater
than both of the elements",00:17:27.990,00:17:31.990
"that you see on the left and
the right, you're a peak.",00:17:31.990,00:17:35.120
OK?,00:17:35.120,00:17:35.760
"And in the case of
the edges, you only",00:17:35.760,00:17:38.690
have to look to one side.,00:17:38.690,00:17:40.700
"So position 9 is a peak if i
greater than or equal to h.",00:17:40.700,00:17:53.567
"So you just have to
look to your left there,",00:17:53.567,00:17:55.400
"because you're all the way
on the right hand side.",00:17:55.400,00:17:57.483
All right?,00:17:57.483,00:17:58.270
So that's it.,00:17:58.270,00:18:00.480
"And the statement of the
problem, the one dimensional",00:18:00.480,00:18:03.920
"version, is find the
peak if it exists.",00:18:03.920,00:18:13.820
All right?,00:18:19.490,00:18:22.070
That's all there is to it.,00:18:22.070,00:18:24.510
"I'm going to give you a
straightforward algorithm.",00:18:24.510,00:18:27.890
"And then we'll see
if we can improve it.",00:18:27.890,00:18:30.630
All right?,00:18:30.630,00:18:31.270
"You can imagine that the
straightforward algorithm is",00:18:31.270,00:18:34.110
"something that just, you
know, walks across the array.",00:18:34.110,00:18:39.440
"But we need that as a starting
point for building something",00:18:39.440,00:18:43.629
more sophisticated.,00:18:43.629,00:18:44.420
"So let's say we start
from left and all",00:18:49.680,00:18:57.340
"we have is one
traversal, really.",00:18:57.340,00:19:01.500
"So let's say we have
1, 2, and then we",00:19:05.360,00:19:07.930
"have n over 2 over
here corresponding",00:19:07.930,00:19:10.810
"to the middle of
this n element array.",00:19:10.810,00:19:14.620
"And then we have
n minus 1, and n.",00:19:14.620,00:19:18.970
"What I'm interested
in doing is, not only",00:19:18.970,00:19:21.090
"coming up with a
straightforward algorithm,",00:19:21.090,00:19:24.880
"but also precisely
characterizing",00:19:24.880,00:19:29.300
"what its complexity
is in relation",00:19:29.300,00:19:32.030
"to n, which is the
number of inputs.",00:19:32.030,00:19:35.260
Yeah?,00:19:35.260,00:19:35.760
Question?,00:19:35.760,00:19:36.915
"AUDIENCE: Why do
you say if it exists",00:19:36.915,00:19:38.456
"when the criteria
in the [INAUDIBLE]",00:19:38.456,00:19:40.348
guarantees [INAUDIBLE]?,00:19:40.348,00:19:41.397
PROFESSOR: That's exactly right.,00:19:41.397,00:19:42.730
I was going to get to that.,00:19:42.730,00:19:44.540
"So if you look at the
definition of the peak,",00:19:44.540,00:19:50.530
"then what I have here is
greater than or equal to.",00:19:50.530,00:19:55.210
OK?,00:19:55.210,00:19:56.010
"And so this-- That's a great
question that was asked.",00:19:56.010,00:19:59.660
"Why is there ""if it
exists"" in this problem?",00:19:59.660,00:20:04.470
"Now in the case where I have
greater than or equal to,",00:20:04.470,00:20:08.440
"then-- this is a homework
question for you,",00:20:08.440,00:20:12.310
"and for the rest of you-- argue
that any array will always",00:20:12.310,00:20:18.240
have a peak.,00:20:18.240,00:20:19.610
OK?,00:20:19.610,00:20:20.790
"Now if you didn't have the
greater than or equal to,",00:20:20.790,00:20:24.300
"and you had a greater than,
then can you make that argument?",00:20:24.300,00:20:29.070
"No, you can't.",00:20:29.070,00:20:30.120
Right?,00:20:30.120,00:20:30.820
So great question.,00:20:30.820,00:20:33.230
"In this case it's
just a question--",00:20:33.230,00:20:35.859
"You would want to
modify this problem",00:20:35.859,00:20:37.400
statement to find the peak.,00:20:37.400,00:20:38.950
"But if I had a different
definition of a peak-- and this",00:20:38.950,00:20:43.710
is part of algorithmic thinking.,00:20:43.710,00:20:45.850
"You want to be able to create
algorithms that are general,",00:20:45.850,00:20:49.580
"so if the problem
definition changes on you,",00:20:49.580,00:20:52.130
"you still have a starting
point to go attack",00:20:52.130,00:20:54.300
"the second version
of the problem.",00:20:54.300,00:20:56.500
OK?,00:20:56.500,00:20:57.310
"So you could eliminate
this in the case",00:20:57.310,00:21:01.479
"of the greater than or
equal to definition.",00:21:01.479,00:21:03.270
"The ""if it exists"", because
a peak will always exist.",00:21:03.270,00:21:05.664
"But you probably want
to argue that when",00:21:05.664,00:21:07.330
"you want to show the
correctness of your algorithm.",00:21:07.330,00:21:09.950
"And if in fact you had
a different definition,",00:21:09.950,00:21:13.210
"well you would have to create
an algorithm that tells you",00:21:13.210,00:21:19.130
"for sure that a peak
doesn't exist, or find",00:21:19.130,00:21:22.310
a peak if it exists.,00:21:22.310,00:21:23.900
All right?,00:21:23.900,00:21:24.400
"So that's really
the general case.",00:21:24.400,00:21:26.300
"Many a time it's possible that
you're asked to do something,",00:21:26.300,00:21:29.830
"and you can't actually give
an answer to the question,",00:21:29.830,00:21:34.990
"or find something that satisfies
all the constraints required.",00:21:34.990,00:21:39.335
"And in that case, you want to
be able to put up your hand",00:21:39.335,00:21:41.710
"and say, you know what?",00:21:41.710,00:21:43.470
I searched long and hard.,00:21:43.470,00:21:44.870
I searched exhaustively.,00:21:44.870,00:21:46.730
"Here's my argument that
I searched exhaustively,",00:21:46.730,00:21:49.930
and I couldn't find it.,00:21:49.930,00:21:51.101
Right?,00:21:51.101,00:21:51.600
"If you do that, you
get to keep your job.",00:21:51.600,00:21:53.490
Right?,00:21:53.490,00:21:54.580
"Otherwise there's
always the case",00:21:54.580,00:21:57.390
"that you didn't
search hard enough.",00:21:57.390,00:21:59.060
"So it's nice to
have that argument.",00:21:59.060,00:22:02.310
All right?,00:22:02.310,00:22:02.810
Great.,00:22:02.810,00:22:03.080

questions at any time.",00:22:07.840,00:22:11.550
"So let's talk about the
straightforward algorithm.",00:22:11.550,00:22:14.540
"The straightforward
algorithm is something",00:22:14.540,00:22:16.510
"that starts from the left
and just walks across.",00:22:16.510,00:22:20.940
"And you might have something
that looks like that.",00:22:20.940,00:22:24.285
All right?,00:22:24.285,00:22:24.960
"By that-- By this I mean
the numbers are increasing",00:22:24.960,00:22:27.830
"as you start from the
left, the peak is somewhere",00:22:27.830,00:22:30.730
"in the middle, and then
things start decreasing.",00:22:30.730,00:22:33.620
Right?,00:22:33.620,00:22:34.120
"So in this case, you know,
this might be the peak.",00:22:34.120,00:22:39.570
"You also may have
a situation where",00:22:46.950,00:22:49.550
"the peak is all the
way on the right,",00:22:49.550,00:22:51.240
you started from the left.,00:22:51.240,00:22:52.780
"And it's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, literally",00:22:52.780,00:22:55.060
in terms of the numbers.,00:22:55.060,00:22:56.390
"And you're going to look at
n elements going all the way",00:22:56.390,00:23:01.000
"to the right in order
to find the peak.",00:23:01.000,00:23:04.800
"So in the case of
the middle you'd",00:23:04.800,00:23:07.310
look at n over 2 elements.,00:23:07.310,00:23:10.940
If it was right in the middle.,00:23:13.770,00:23:15.020
"And the complexity,
worst case complexity--",00:23:18.340,00:23:26.340
--is what we call theta n.,00:23:26.340,00:23:29.830
"And it's theta n, because
in the worst case,",00:23:29.830,00:23:33.580
"you may have to look
at all n elements.",00:23:33.580,00:23:36.294
"And that would be the case
where you started from the left",00:23:36.294,00:23:38.710
"and you had to go all
the way to the right.",00:23:38.710,00:23:40.860
"Now remember theta n is
essentially something",00:23:40.860,00:23:43.850
that's says of the order of n.,00:23:43.850,00:23:45.830
"So it gives you both the lower
bound and an upper bound.",00:23:45.830,00:23:49.400
"Big [? O ?] of n is
just upper bound.",00:23:49.400,00:23:52.470
"And what we're
saying here is, we're",00:23:52.470,00:23:53.970
"saying this algorithm
that starts from the left",00:23:53.970,00:23:58.110
"is going to, essentially,
require in the worst case",00:23:58.110,00:24:03.470
"something that's a
constant times n.",00:24:03.470,00:24:06.740
OK?,00:24:06.740,00:24:07.880
"And you know that
constant could be 1.",00:24:07.880,00:24:11.210
"You could certainly
set things up that way.",00:24:11.210,00:24:13.400
"Or if you had a different
kind of algorithm,",00:24:13.400,00:24:15.860
"maybe you could work
on the constant.",00:24:15.860,00:24:18.460
"But bottom line, we're only
concerned, at this moment,",00:24:18.460,00:24:22.360
about as asymptotic complexity.,00:24:22.360,00:24:24.760
"And the asymptotic complexity
of this algorithm is linear.",00:24:24.760,00:24:29.030
All right?,00:24:29.030,00:24:29.710
That make sense?,00:24:29.710,00:24:32.150
OK.,00:24:32.150,00:24:32.930
So someone help me do better.,00:24:32.930,00:24:38.950
How can we do better?,00:24:38.950,00:24:39.890
"How can we lower the
asymptotic complexity",00:24:39.890,00:24:43.040
"of a one dimensional
peak finder?",00:24:43.040,00:24:46.700
"Anybody want to
take a stab at that?",00:24:46.700,00:24:48.450
Yeah?,00:24:48.450,00:24:48.950
Back there.,00:24:48.950,00:24:50.086
"AUDIENCE: Do a
binary search subset.",00:24:50.086,00:24:52.078
"You look at the
middle, and whatever",00:24:52.078,00:24:54.236
"is higher-- whichever side is
higher, then cut that in half,",00:24:54.236,00:24:58.552
because you know there's a peak.,00:24:58.552,00:25:00.290
PROFESSOR: On--,00:25:00.290,00:25:00.410
"AUDIENCE: For example
if you're in the middle",00:25:00.410,00:25:01.578
"on the right side--
there's a higher number",00:25:01.578,00:25:03.492
"on the right side--
then you would just",00:25:03.492,00:25:05.116
"look at that, because you know
that your peak's somewhere",00:25:05.116,00:25:06.946
in there.,00:25:06.946,00:25:07.446
"And you continue
cutting in half.",00:25:07.446,00:25:08.900
PROFESSOR: Excellent!,00:25:08.900,00:25:09.360
Excellent!,00:25:09.360,00:25:09.859
That's exactly right.,00:25:09.859,00:25:11.200
"So you can-- You can do
something different, which",00:25:11.200,00:25:14.850
"is essentially try and
break up this problem.",00:25:14.850,00:25:19.240
"Use a divide and conquer
strategy, and recursively break",00:25:19.240,00:25:22.650
"up this one dimensional
array into smaller arrays.",00:25:22.650,00:25:26.550
"And try and get this
complexity down.",00:25:26.550,00:25:29.940
Yeah?,00:25:29.940,00:25:30.440
"AUDIENCE: Are we assuming
that there's only one peak?",00:25:30.440,00:25:33.239
"PROFESSOR: No, we're not.",00:25:33.239,00:25:34.280
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:25:34.280,00:25:34.980
"PROFESSOR: It's find
a peak if it exists.",00:25:34.980,00:25:39.219
"And in this case
it's, ""find a peak"",",00:25:39.219,00:25:40.760
because of the definition.,00:25:40.760,00:25:42.610
"We don't really need
this as it was discussed.",00:25:42.610,00:25:45.910
All right?,00:25:45.910,00:25:46.660
OK.,00:25:46.660,00:25:47.180
So--,00:25:47.180,00:25:49.080
"So that was a great answer,
and-- You know this class",00:25:49.080,00:25:53.392
"after while is
going to get boring.",00:25:53.392,00:25:54.850
Right?,00:25:54.850,00:25:55.770
Every class gets boring.,00:25:55.770,00:25:57.650
"So we, you know, try and
break the monotony here a bit.",00:25:57.650,00:26:00.777
"And so-- And then the other
thing that we realized",00:26:00.777,00:26:02.860
"was that these seats
you're sitting on-- this",00:26:02.860,00:26:04.790
"is a nice classroom-- but
the seats you're sitting on",00:26:04.790,00:26:06.998
are kind of hard.,00:26:06.998,00:26:07.750
Right?,00:26:07.750,00:26:08.250
"So what Eric and I
did was we decided",00:26:08.250,00:26:10.787
"we'll help you guys
out, especially the ones",00:26:10.787,00:26:12.620
"who are-- who are
interacting with us.",00:26:12.620,00:26:15.870
And we have these--,00:26:15.870,00:26:17.580
[LAUGHTER],00:26:17.580,00:26:18.610
"--cushions that
are 6.006 cushions.",00:26:18.610,00:26:22.145
"And, you know, that's a 2
by 2 by 2 Rubik's cube here.",00:26:22.145,00:26:25.170
"And since you answered the first
question, you get a cushion.",00:26:25.170,00:26:28.410
"This is kind of like a
Frisbee, but not really.",00:26:28.410,00:26:31.510
So--,00:26:31.510,00:26:32.010
[LAUGHTER],00:26:32.010,00:26:32.510
"I'm not sure-- I'm not sure
I'm going to get it to you.",00:26:32.510,00:26:35.190
"But the other
thing I want to say",00:26:35.190,00:26:36.565
is this is not a baseball game.,00:26:36.565,00:26:37.970
Right?,00:26:37.970,00:26:38.469
"Where you just grab the
ball as it comes by.",00:26:38.469,00:26:40.560
"This is meant for him, my
friend in the red shirt.",00:26:40.560,00:26:43.670
So here you go.,00:26:43.670,00:26:45.920
"Ah, too bad.",00:26:45.920,00:26:46.820
All right.,00:26:46.820,00:26:47.620
It is soft.,00:26:47.620,00:26:48.580
"So, you know, it won't-- it
won't hurt you if hits you.",00:26:48.580,00:26:51.255
[LAUGHTER],00:26:51.255,00:26:51.910
All right.,00:26:51.910,00:26:52.540
So we got a bunch of these.,00:26:52.540,00:26:54.216
"And raise your hands,
you know, going",00:26:54.216,00:26:57.300
"to ask-- There's going
to be-- I think-- There's",00:26:57.300,00:27:01.025
"some trivial questions that
we're going to ask just",00:27:01.025,00:27:03.150
to make sure you're awake.,00:27:03.150,00:27:05.180
"So an answer to that
doesn't get you a cushion.",00:27:05.180,00:27:07.750
"But an answer like--
What's your name?",00:27:07.750,00:27:10.514
AUDIENCE: Chase.,00:27:10.514,00:27:11.180
PROFESSOR: Chase.,00:27:11.180,00:27:11.890
"An answer like
Chase just gave is--",00:27:11.890,00:27:15.134
"that's a good answer to
a nontrivial question.",00:27:15.134,00:27:17.050
That gets you a cushion.,00:27:17.050,00:27:18.500
OK?,00:27:18.500,00:27:19.290
"All right, great.",00:27:19.290,00:27:20.300
"So let's put up by
Chase's algorithm up here.",00:27:20.300,00:27:24.230
"I'm going to write it
out for the 1D version.",00:27:24.230,00:27:26.510
"So what we have here is
a recursive algorithm.",00:27:41.390,00:27:45.205
"So the picture you want
to keep in your head",00:28:02.967,00:28:04.800
"is this picture
that I put up there.",00:28:04.800,00:28:06.860
"And this is a divide
and conquer algorithm.",00:28:06.860,00:28:11.010
"You're going to see this over
and over-- this paradigm--",00:28:11.010,00:28:14.140
over and over in 6.006.,00:28:14.140,00:28:17.360
"We're going to look at
the n over 2 position.",00:28:17.360,00:28:22.745
"And we're going to
look to the left,",00:28:25.990,00:28:28.700
"and we're going to
look to the right.",00:28:28.700,00:28:31.010
"And we're going to
do that in sequence.",00:28:31.010,00:28:33.420
So--,00:28:33.420,00:28:33.920
"--if a n over 2 is less than
a n over 2 minus 1, then--",00:28:36.680,00:28:50.950
--only look at the left half.,00:28:50.950,00:28:54.380
"1 through n over 2 minus 1 to
look for peak-- for a peak.",00:28:57.680,00:29:04.410
All right?,00:29:08.381,00:29:08.880
So that's step one.,00:29:08.880,00:29:10.295
"And you know I could
put it on the right hand",00:29:10.295,00:29:12.170
"side or the left hand side,
doesn't really matter.",00:29:12.170,00:29:15.990
"I chose to do the left hand
side first, the left half.",00:29:15.990,00:29:20.311
"And so what I've done is,
through that one step,",00:29:20.311,00:29:24.570
"if in fact you have that
condition-- a n over 2",00:29:24.570,00:29:30.010
"is less than a n over 2 minus
1-- then you move to your left",00:29:30.010,00:29:33.630
"and you work on one
half of the problem.",00:29:33.630,00:29:37.490
"But if that's not the case,
then if n over-- n over 2",00:29:37.490,00:29:43.120
"is less than a over n
over-- n by 2 plus 1,",00:29:43.120,00:29:48.170
"then only look at n over 2
plus 1 through n for a peak.",00:29:48.170,00:29:57.520
"So I haven't bothered
writing out all the words.",00:29:57.520,00:29:59.960
"They're exactly the same
as the left hand side.",00:29:59.960,00:30:03.480
"You just look to
the right hand side.",00:30:03.480,00:30:06.160
"Otherwise if both of these
conditions don't fire,",00:30:06.160,00:30:10.430
you're actually done.,00:30:10.430,00:30:12.160
OK?,00:30:12.160,00:30:12.660
"That's actually the best case
in terms of finishing early,",00:30:12.660,00:30:16.130
at least in this recursive step.,00:30:16.130,00:30:18.340
"Because now the n over
2 position is a peak.",00:30:18.340,00:30:22.580
"Because what you found is
that the n over 2 position",00:30:27.210,00:30:30.500
"is greater than or equal to
both of its adjacent positions,",00:30:30.500,00:30:34.740
"and that's exactly the
definition of a peak.",00:30:34.740,00:30:36.850
So you're done.,00:30:36.850,00:30:38.430
OK?,00:30:38.430,00:30:39.350
So all of this is good.,00:30:39.350,00:30:44.500
"You want to write an argument
that this algorithm is correct.",00:30:44.500,00:30:53.307
"And I'm not going
to bother with that.",00:30:53.307,00:30:54.890
"I just wave my hands a
bit, and you all nodded,",00:30:54.890,00:30:59.530
so we're done with that.,00:30:59.530,00:31:01.230
"But the point being you
will see in your problem set",00:31:01.230,00:31:07.310
"a precise argument for a more
complicated algorithm, the 2D",00:31:07.310,00:31:11.560
version of this.,00:31:11.560,00:31:12.720
"And that should be a template
for you to go write a proof,",00:31:12.720,00:31:16.900
"or an argument, a
formal argument,",00:31:16.900,00:31:19.200
"that a particular
algorithm is correct.",00:31:19.200,00:31:21.620
"That it does what
it claims to do.",00:31:21.620,00:31:23.550
"And in this case it's two,
three lines of careful reasoning",00:31:23.550,00:31:30.370
"that essentially say, given
the definition of the peak,",00:31:30.370,00:31:34.520
"that this is going to
find a peak in the array",00:31:34.520,00:31:38.600
that you're given.,00:31:38.600,00:31:39.860
All right?,00:31:39.860,00:31:40.900
"So we all believe that
this algorithm is correct.",00:31:40.900,00:31:44.910
"Let's talk now about the
complexity of this algorithm.",00:31:44.910,00:31:48.650
"Because the whole
point of this algorithm",00:31:48.650,00:31:50.630
"was because we didn't
like this theta",00:31:50.630,00:31:52.700
"n complexity corresponding to
the straightforward algorithm.",00:31:52.700,00:31:56.350
So it'd like to do better.,00:31:56.350,00:31:57.470
"So what I'd like to
do is ask one of you",00:32:08.350,00:32:10.830
"to give me a recurrence relation
of the kind, you know, T of n",00:32:10.830,00:32:14.890
"equals blah, blah, blah.",00:32:14.890,00:32:18.040
"That would correspond to
this recursive algorithm,",00:32:18.040,00:32:22.310
"this divide and
conquer algorithm.",00:32:22.310,00:32:24.020
"And then using that, I'd like
to get to the actual complexity",00:32:24.020,00:32:29.050
"in terms of what the theta
of complexity corresponds to.",00:32:29.050,00:32:33.280
Yeah?,00:32:33.280,00:32:33.780
Back there?,00:32:33.780,00:32:34.752
"AUDIENCE: So the worst
case scenario if T of n",00:32:34.752,00:32:39.680

PROFESSOR: Great.,00:32:52.022,00:32:52.730
Exactly right.,00:32:52.730,00:32:53.550
That's exactly right.,00:32:53.550,00:32:54.460
"So if you look at this
algorithm and you say,",00:32:54.460,00:32:58.370
"from a computation
standpoint, can I",00:32:58.370,00:33:01.290
"write an equation
corresponding to the execution",00:33:01.290,00:33:05.510
of this algorithm?,00:33:05.510,00:33:06.570
"And you say, T of n is the work
that this algorithm does on--",00:33:06.570,00:33:11.350
as input of size n.,00:33:11.350,00:33:13.630
OK?,00:33:13.630,00:33:14.130
Then I can write this equation.,00:33:25.390,00:33:28.550

potentially the two comparisons",00:33:34.530,00:33:37.697
"that you do-- looking
at the left hand",00:33:37.697,00:33:39.280
side and the right hand side.,00:33:39.280,00:33:41.440
"So that's-- 2 is a constant,
so that's why we put theta 1.",00:33:41.440,00:33:44.580
All right?,00:33:44.580,00:33:45.200
"So you get a cushion, too.",00:33:45.200,00:33:47.060
Watch out guys.,00:33:47.060,00:33:49.630
Whoa!,00:33:49.630,00:33:50.780
Oh actually that wasn't so bad.,00:33:50.780,00:33:52.192
Good.,00:33:52.192,00:33:54.000
"Veers left, Eric.",00:33:54.000,00:33:55.620
Veers left.,00:33:55.620,00:33:57.420
"So if you take this and
you start expanding it,",00:33:57.420,00:34:03.360
"eventually you're going
to get to the base",00:34:03.360,00:34:05.180
"case, which is T
of 1 is theta 1.",00:34:05.180,00:34:12.091
Right?,00:34:12.091,00:34:12.590
"Because you have a one element
array you just for that array",00:34:12.590,00:34:16.580
"it's just going to
return that as a peak.",00:34:16.580,00:34:19.650
"And so if you do that, and
you expand it all the way out,",00:34:19.650,00:34:23.130
"then you can write T of n
equals theta 1 plus theta 1.",00:34:23.130,00:34:31.080
"And you're going to do this
log to the base 2 of n times.",00:34:31.080,00:34:39.300
"And adding these
all up, gives you",00:34:39.300,00:34:43.660
a complexity theta log 2 of n.,00:34:43.660,00:34:46.360
Right?,00:34:46.360,00:34:48.330
"So now you compare
this with that.",00:34:48.330,00:34:53.089
"And there's really
a huge difference.",00:34:53.089,00:34:54.630
"There's an exponential
difference.",00:34:54.630,00:34:57.440
"If you coded up this
algorithm in Python--",00:34:57.440,00:35:01.860
"and I did-- both these
algorithms for the 1D version--",00:35:01.860,00:35:06.170
"and if you run it on n
being 10 million or so,",00:35:06.170,00:35:14.160
"then this algorithm
takes 13 seconds.",00:35:14.160,00:35:17.820
OK?,00:35:17.820,00:35:18.320
"The-- The theta 10
algorithm takes 13 seconds.",00:35:18.320,00:35:21.880
"And this one takes
0.001 seconds.",00:35:21.880,00:35:26.070
OK?,00:35:26.070,00:35:26.570
Huge difference.,00:35:26.570,00:35:27.929
"So there is a big difference
between theta n and theta log",00:35:27.929,00:35:30.345
n.,00:35:30.345,00:35:31.970
"It's literally the difference
between 2 raised to n, and n.",00:35:31.970,00:35:35.840
"It makes sense to try
and reduce complexity",00:35:35.840,00:35:40.120
"as you can see,
especially if you're",00:35:40.120,00:35:43.000
talking about large inputs.,00:35:43.000,00:35:44.450
All right?,00:35:44.450,00:35:45.390
"And you'll see that
more clearly as we",00:35:45.390,00:35:48.860
"go to a 2D version
of this problem.",00:35:48.860,00:35:51.300
All right?,00:35:51.300,00:35:52.202
"So you can't really
do better for the 1D.",00:35:52.202,00:35:53.910
"The 1D is a
straightforward problem.",00:35:53.910,00:35:56.750
"It gets a little
more interesting--",00:35:56.750,00:35:58.500
"the problems get a
little-- excuse me,",00:35:58.500,00:36:01.080
"the algorithms get a
little more sophisticated",00:36:01.080,00:36:03.600
"when we look at a 2D
version of peak finding.",00:36:03.600,00:36:08.340
"So let's talk about
the 2D version.",00:36:08.340,00:36:10.535
"So as you can imagine
in the 2D version",00:36:15.810,00:36:18.250
"you have a matrix, or a
two dimensional array.",00:36:18.250,00:36:20.715
"And we'll say this thing
has n rows and m columns.",00:36:23.490,00:36:29.575
"And now we have to
define what a peak is.",00:36:34.700,00:36:37.190
And it's a hill.,00:36:37.190,00:36:38.350
"It's the obvious
definition of a peak.",00:36:38.350,00:36:41.540
"So if you had a in
here, c, b, d, e.",00:36:41.540,00:36:50.490
"Then as you can guess, a is
a 2D peak if, and only if,",00:36:50.490,00:37:02.250
"a greater than or equal to b;
a greater than or equal to d, c",00:37:02.250,00:37:08.830
and e.,00:37:08.830,00:37:10.061
All right?,00:37:10.061,00:37:10.560
So it's a little hill up there.,00:37:10.560,00:37:12.230
All right?,00:37:12.230,00:37:12.730
"And again I've used the
greater than or equal to here,",00:37:12.730,00:37:15.120
"so that's similar to
the 1D in the case",00:37:15.120,00:37:18.490
"that you'll always find
a peak in any 2D matrix.",00:37:18.490,00:37:21.345
"Now again I'll give you the
straightforward algorithm,",00:37:23.960,00:37:29.210
"and we'll call it the
Greedy Ascent algorithm.",00:37:29.210,00:37:31.640
"And the Greedy Ascent algorithm
essentially picks a direction",00:37:41.660,00:37:45.820
"and, you know, tries to
follow that direction in order",00:37:45.820,00:37:50.560
to find a peak.,00:37:50.560,00:37:52.770
"So for example, if I
had this particular--",00:37:52.770,00:38:01.840
"--matrix; 14, 13,
12, 15, 9, 11, 17--",00:38:01.840,00:38:10.790
"Then what might happen is if
I started at some arbitrary",00:38:17.010,00:38:20.850
"midpoint-- So the
Greedy Ascent algorithm",00:38:20.850,00:38:23.360
"has to make choices
as to where to start.",00:38:23.360,00:38:26.210
"Just like we had
different cases here,",00:38:26.210,00:38:29.142
"you have to make a choice
as to where to start.",00:38:29.142,00:38:31.100
"You might want to
start in the middle,",00:38:31.100,00:38:32.770
"and you might want to
work your way left first.",00:38:32.770,00:38:35.560
"Or you're going to all--
You just keep going left,",00:38:35.560,00:38:38.380
our keep going right.,00:38:38.380,00:38:39.720
"And if you hit an
edge, you go down.",00:38:39.720,00:38:42.340
"So you make some choices as
to what the default traversal",00:38:42.340,00:38:46.450
directions are.,00:38:46.450,00:38:47.810
"And so if you say you
want to start with 12,",00:38:47.810,00:38:50.820
"you are going to go look
for something to left.",00:38:50.820,00:38:54.050
"And if it's greater than, you're
going to follow that direction.",00:38:54.050,00:38:58.470
"If it's not, if it's
less, then you're",00:38:58.470,00:39:00.950
"going to go in the other
direction, in this case,",00:39:00.950,00:39:04.200
for example.,00:39:04.200,00:39:05.160
"So in this case you'll go to
12, 13 , 14, 15, 16, 17, 19,",00:39:05.160,00:39:13.120
and 20.,00:39:13.120,00:39:14.230
"And you'd find-- You
'd find this peak.",00:39:14.230,00:39:17.765
"Now I haven't given you
the specific details",00:39:17.765,00:39:21.680
of a Greedy Ascent algorithm.,00:39:21.680,00:39:23.750
"But I think if you look at
the worst case possibilities",00:39:23.750,00:39:33.400
"here, with respect
to a given matrix,",00:39:33.400,00:39:36.370
"and for any given
starting point,",00:39:36.370,00:39:38.920
"and for any given strategy-- in
terms of choosing left first,",00:39:38.920,00:39:43.270
"versus right first, or down
first versus up first--",00:39:43.270,00:39:48.630
"you will have a
situation where-- just",00:39:48.630,00:39:51.370
"like we had in the 1D
case-- you may end up",00:39:51.370,00:39:55.450
"touching a large fraction of
the elements in this 2D array.",00:39:55.450,00:40:02.015
OK?,00:40:02.015,00:40:02.750
"So in this case, we
ended up, you know,",00:40:02.750,00:40:05.190
"touching a bunch of
different elements.",00:40:05.190,00:40:06.890
"And it's quite possible that
you could end up touching--",00:40:06.890,00:40:10.529
"starting from the midpoint--
you could up touching half",00:40:10.529,00:40:12.820
"the elements, and in some cases,
touching all the elements.",00:40:12.820,00:40:16.990
"So if you do a worst case
analysis of this algorithm--",00:40:16.990,00:40:23.000
"a particular algorithm with
particular choices in terms",00:40:23.000,00:40:25.410
"of the starting point and
the direction of search--",00:40:25.410,00:40:30.370
"a Greedy Ascent algorithm would
have theta n m complexity.",00:40:30.370,00:40:33.750
All right?,00:40:33.750,00:40:34.320
"And in the case where n
equals m, or m equals n,",00:40:34.320,00:40:42.480
"you'd have theta n
squared complexity.",00:40:42.480,00:40:44.840
OK?,00:40:44.840,00:40:46.290
"I won't spend very
much time on this,",00:40:46.290,00:40:48.440
"because I want to talk
to you about the divide",00:40:48.440,00:40:52.150
"and conquer versions of this
algorithm for the 2D peak.",00:40:52.150,00:40:58.020
"But hopefully you're
all with me with respect",00:40:58.020,00:41:00.860
"to what the worst
case complexity is.",00:41:00.860,00:41:03.530
All right?,00:41:03.530,00:41:04.990
People buy that?,00:41:04.990,00:41:06.070
Yeah.,00:41:06.070,00:41:06.570
Question back there.,00:41:06.570,00:41:07.390
"AUDIENCE: Can you-- Is
that an approximation?",00:41:07.390,00:41:09.264
"Or can you actually get
to n times m traversals?",00:41:09.264,00:41:14.630
"PROFESSOR: So there are specific
Greedy Ascent algorithms,",00:41:14.630,00:41:18.780
"and specific matrices
where, if I give you",00:41:18.780,00:41:21.680
"the code for the algorithm, and
I give you a specific matrix,",00:41:21.680,00:41:24.680
"that I could make you touch
all of these elements.",00:41:24.680,00:41:28.200
That's correct.,00:41:28.200,00:41:28.870
"So we're talking
about worst case.",00:41:28.870,00:41:30.600
"You're being very
paranoid when you",00:41:30.600,00:41:32.260
"talk about worst
case complexity.",00:41:32.260,00:41:34.540
"And so I'm-- hand
waving a bit here,",00:41:34.540,00:41:38.800
"simply because I haven't
given you the specifics",00:41:38.800,00:41:41.150
of the algorithm yet.,00:41:41.150,00:41:42.150
Right?,00:41:42.150,00:41:42.650
"This is really a
set of algorithms,",00:41:42.650,00:41:44.669
"because I haven't
given you the code,",00:41:44.669,00:41:46.210
"I haven't told you
where it starts,",00:41:46.210,00:41:47.668
and which direction it goes.,00:41:47.668,00:41:49.050
"But you go, do
that, fix it, and I",00:41:49.050,00:41:52.380
"would be the person who tries to
find the worst case complexity.",00:41:52.380,00:41:55.380
"Suddenly it's very
easy to get to theta n",00:41:55.380,00:41:58.250
"m in terms of having some
constant multiplying n times m.",00:41:58.250,00:42:03.140
"But you can definitely
get to that constant",00:42:03.140,00:42:05.810
being very close to 1.,00:42:05.810,00:42:08.520
OK?,00:42:08.520,00:42:09.910
If not 1.,00:42:09.910,00:42:11.350
All right.,00:42:11.350,00:42:12.190
"So let's talk about
divide and conquer.",00:42:12.190,00:42:14.480
"And let's say that
I did something",00:42:14.480,00:42:18.720
"like this, where I just tried
to jam the binary search",00:42:18.720,00:42:22.770
algorithm into the 2D version.,00:42:22.770,00:42:26.340
All right?,00:42:26.340,00:42:26.840
So what I'm going to do is--,00:42:37.780,00:42:43.830
"--I'm going to pick the middle
column, j equals m over 2.",00:42:43.830,00:42:55.430
"And I'm going to
find a 1D peak using",00:42:55.430,00:43:00.710
whatever algorithm I want.,00:43:00.710,00:43:01.810
"And I'll probably end up using
the more efficient algorithm,",00:43:01.810,00:43:04.820
"the binary search
version that's gone",00:43:04.820,00:43:07.850
"all the way to the left
of the board there.",00:43:07.850,00:43:10.530
"And let's say I find a
binary peak at (i, j).",00:43:10.530,00:43:14.000
"Because I've picked a column,
and I'm just finding a 1D peak.",00:43:14.000,00:43:17.060
So this is j equals m over 2.,00:43:20.320,00:43:23.550
That's i.,00:43:23.550,00:43:25.690
"Now I use (i,j).",00:43:25.690,00:43:29.850
In particular row i as a start--,00:43:29.850,00:43:38.730
--to find a 1D peak on row i.,00:43:38.730,00:43:42.310

I'm really happy.",00:43:47.470,00:43:50.041
OK?,00:43:50.041,00:43:50.540
"Because I say, wow.",00:43:50.540,00:43:53.440
"I picked a middle column,
I found a 1D peak,",00:43:53.440,00:43:56.850
"that is theta m complexity to
find a 1D peak as we argued.",00:43:56.850,00:44:01.350

You're right.,00:44:08.700,00:44:09.730
"The log n complexity,
that's what this was.",00:44:09.730,00:44:13.490
So I do have that here.,00:44:13.490,00:44:15.031
Yeah.,00:44:15.031,00:44:15.530
Log n complexity.,00:44:15.530,00:44:16.470
"Thanks, Eric.",00:44:16.470,00:44:18.920

can find a 1D peak on row i.",00:44:18.920,00:44:26.130
"In this case row
i would be m wide,",00:44:26.130,00:44:28.690

"If n equals m, then I have
a couple of steps of log n,",00:44:30.630,00:44:33.840

All right?,00:44:35.050,00:44:36.030
Am I done?,00:44:36.030,00:44:38.320
No.,00:44:38.320,00:44:39.640

"You know being correcting
and inefficient",00:45:07.215,00:45:09.640
"is definitely better than
being inefficient-- I'm sorry.",00:45:09.640,00:45:13.580
Being incorrect and efficient.,00:45:13.580,00:45:15.790
"So this is an
efficient algorithm,",00:45:15.790,00:45:17.870
"in the sense that it will
only take log n time,",00:45:17.870,00:45:22.077
but it doesn't work.,00:45:22.077,00:45:22.910
"And I'll give you
a simple example",00:45:22.910,00:45:25.620
here where it doesn't work.,00:45:25.620,00:45:27.650
The problem is--,00:45:32.490,00:45:35.680
--a 2D peak--,00:45:35.680,00:45:39.960
--may not exist--,00:45:39.960,00:45:44.150
--on row i.,00:45:44.150,00:45:46.090
And here's an example of that.,00:45:46.090,00:45:47.700
"Actually this is-- This is
exactly the example of that.",00:45:53.640,00:45:58.360
"Let's say that I
started with this row.",00:45:58.360,00:46:02.690
"Since it's-- I'm starting
with the middle row,",00:46:02.690,00:46:05.057
"and I could start with
this one or that one.",00:46:05.057,00:46:06.890
"Let's say I started
with that one.",00:46:06.890,00:46:10.640
I end up finding a peak.,00:46:10.640,00:46:16.350
"And if this were 10 up here,
I'd choose 12 as a peak.",00:46:16.350,00:46:22.330
"And it's quite possible
that I return 12 as a peak.",00:46:22.330,00:46:25.856
"Even though 19 is
bigger, because 12",00:46:25.856,00:46:27.900
"is a peak given
10 and 11 up here.",00:46:27.900,00:46:30.370
"And then when I choose
this particular row,",00:46:30.370,00:46:33.060
"and I find a peak on
this row, it would be 14.",00:46:33.060,00:46:36.720
That is a 1D peak on this row.,00:46:36.720,00:46:38.870
But 14 is not a 2D peak.,00:46:38.870,00:46:41.840
OK?,00:46:41.840,00:46:42.790
"So this particular example,
14 would return 14.",00:46:42.790,00:46:47.402
And 14 is not a 2D peak.,00:46:47.402,00:46:50.740
All right?,00:46:50.740,00:46:53.730
"You can collect your
cushion after the class.",00:46:53.730,00:46:57.460
So not so good.,00:46:57.460,00:47:01.880
"Look like an efficient
algorithm, but doesn't work.",00:47:01.880,00:47:05.430
All right?,00:47:05.430,00:47:06.180
"So how can we get to
something that actually works?",00:47:06.180,00:47:09.290
"So the last algorithm that
I'm going to show you--",00:47:09.290,00:47:14.300
"And you'll see four different
algorithms in your problem",00:47:14.300,00:47:16.920
set--,00:47:16.920,00:47:21.260
"--that you'll have to analyze
the complexity for and decide",00:47:21.260,00:47:24.340
"if they're efficient,
and if they're correct.",00:47:24.340,00:47:28.180
"But here's a-- a
recursive version",00:47:28.180,00:47:33.440
"that is better than,
in terms of complexity,",00:47:33.440,00:47:37.650
"than the Greedy
Ascent algorithm.",00:47:37.650,00:47:40.120
And this one works.,00:47:40.120,00:47:43.410
"So what I'm going to do
is pick a middle column.",00:47:43.410,00:47:46.470
j equals m over 2 as before.,00:47:49.750,00:47:51.435
"I'm going to find the
global maximum on column j.",00:47:54.050,00:48:02.480
"And that's going
to be at (i, j).",00:48:05.316,00:48:06.690
"I'm going to compare (i comma
j minus 1), (i comma j),",00:48:09.580,00:48:18.230
"and (i,j plus 1).",00:48:18.230,00:48:20.440
"Which means that once I've
found the maximum in this row,",00:48:20.440,00:48:23.620
"all I'm going to look to
the left and the right,",00:48:23.620,00:48:25.890
and compare.,00:48:25.890,00:48:27.920
"I'm going to pick
the left columns.",00:48:27.920,00:48:30.825
"If (i comma j minus 1) is
greater than (i comma j)--",00:48:33.520,00:48:40.890
and similarly for the right.,00:48:40.890,00:48:42.420
"And if in fact I-- either
of these two conditions",00:48:49.490,00:48:55.720
"don't fire, and what
I have is (i comma j)",00:48:55.720,00:49:00.210
"is greater than or equal
to (i comma j minus 1)",00:49:00.210,00:49:04.280
"and (i comma j plus
1), then I'm done.",00:49:04.280,00:49:07.630
"Just like I had
for the 1D version.",00:49:07.630,00:49:12.760
"If (i comma j) is greater
than or equal to (i comma",00:49:12.760,00:49:17.500
"j minus 1), and (i comma j
plus 1), that implies (i, j)",00:49:17.500,00:49:26.350
is a 2D peak.,00:49:26.350,00:49:28.591
OK?,00:49:28.591,00:49:29.212
"And the reason that
is the case, is",00:49:29.212,00:49:30.670
"because (i comma j) was the
maximum element in that column.",00:49:30.670,00:49:35.902
"So you know that
you've compared it",00:49:35.902,00:49:37.360
"to all of the adjacent elements,
looking up and looking down,",00:49:37.360,00:49:41.520
that's the maximum element.,00:49:41.520,00:49:43.000
"Now you've look at the
left and the right,",00:49:43.000,00:49:45.150
"and in fact it's greater
than or equal to the elements",00:49:45.150,00:49:47.750
on the left and the right.,00:49:47.750,00:49:49.110
And so therefore it's a 2D peak.,00:49:49.110,00:49:51.290
OK?,00:49:51.290,00:49:52.270
"So in this case, when you pick
the left or the right columns--",00:49:52.270,00:49:57.710
"you'll pick one of
them-- you're going",00:49:57.710,00:49:59.570
"to solve the new problem with
half the number of columns.",00:49:59.570,00:50:08.025
All right?,00:50:16.540,00:50:17.580
"And again, you have to
go through an analysis,",00:50:17.580,00:50:20.965
"or an argument, to make sure
that this algorithm is correct.",00:50:20.965,00:50:24.950
"But its intuitively correct,
simply because it matches",00:50:24.950,00:50:29.740
"the 1D version
much more closely.",00:50:29.740,00:50:33.190
"And you also have your condition
where you break away right",00:50:33.190,00:50:37.870
"here, where you have a 2D
peak, just like the 1D version.",00:50:37.870,00:50:41.160
"And what you've done
is break this matrix up",00:50:41.160,00:50:43.930
into half the size.,00:50:43.930,00:50:46.190
"And that's essentially
why this algorithm works.",00:50:46.190,00:50:51.090
When you have a single column--,00:50:51.090,00:50:55.806
"--find the global
maximum and you're done.",00:51:01.070,00:51:09.610
All right?,00:51:09.610,00:51:10.110
So that's the base case.,00:51:10.110,00:51:12.570
"So let me end with
just writing out",00:51:12.570,00:51:14.670
"what the recurrence relation
for the complexity of this",00:51:14.670,00:51:17.870
"is, and argue what the overall
complexity of this algorithm",00:51:17.870,00:51:22.481
is.,00:51:22.481,00:51:22.980
"And then I'll give
you the bad news.",00:51:25.221,00:51:26.720
All right.,00:51:30.781,00:51:31.280
"So overall what you have is, you
have something like T of (n, m)",00:51:31.280,00:51:36.260
"equals T of (n, m
over 2) plus theta n.",00:51:36.260,00:51:42.570
Why is that?,00:51:42.570,00:51:43.640
"Well n is the number of rows,
m is the number of columns.",00:51:43.640,00:51:47.830
"In one case you'll be
breaking things down",00:51:47.830,00:51:51.430
"into half the number of
columns, which is m over 2.",00:51:51.430,00:51:54.630
"And in order to find
the global maximum,",00:51:54.630,00:51:57.520
"you'll be doing theta
n work, because you're",00:51:57.520,00:52:00.220
finding the global maximum.,00:52:00.220,00:52:01.495
Right?,00:52:01.495,00:52:01.995
"You just have to
scan it-- this--",00:52:01.995,00:52:05.270
"That's the way-- That's
what it's going to take.",00:52:05.270,00:52:08.840
"And so if you do that, and
you go run it through--",00:52:08.840,00:52:11.960
"and you know that T of
(n, 1) is theta n-- which",00:52:11.960,00:52:16.210
"is this last part over
here-- that's your base case.",00:52:16.210,00:52:20.880
"You get T of (n, m) is theta
of n added to theta of n,",00:52:20.880,00:52:28.560
"log of m times--
log 2 of m times.",00:52:28.560,00:52:34.820
"Which is theta of
n-- log 2 of m.",00:52:34.820,00:52:42.250
All right?,00:52:42.250,00:52:43.640
"So you're not done
with peak finding.",00:52:43.640,00:52:48.120
"What you'll see is at four
algorithms coded in Python--",00:52:48.120,00:52:53.082
"I'm not going to give away
what those algorithms are,",00:52:53.082,00:52:55.290
"but you'll have
to recognize them.",00:52:55.290,00:52:57.090
"You will have seen versions
of those algorithms",00:52:57.090,00:53:00.180
already in lecture.,00:53:00.180,00:53:01.850
"And your job is going to be to
analyze the algorithms, as I",00:53:01.850,00:53:06.210
"said before, prove that
one of them is correct,",00:53:06.210,00:53:09.690

the ones that aren't correct.",00:53:09.690,00:53:12.784

will stick around",00:53:12.784,00:53:14.200
"here to answer questions--
logistical questions--",00:53:14.200,00:53:17.110
