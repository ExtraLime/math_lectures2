"Okay so I'd like to begin the
second lecture by reminding you",00:00:22.600,00:00:27.490
what we did last time.,00:00:27.490,00:00:30.770
"So last time, we
defined the derivative",00:00:30.770,00:00:50.520
as the slope of a tangent line.,00:00:50.520,00:01:04.260
"So that was our
geometric point of view",00:01:04.260,00:01:07.080
"and we also did a
couple of computations.",00:01:07.080,00:01:10.470
"We worked out that the
derivative of 1 / x was -1 /",00:01:10.470,00:01:18.290
x^2.,00:01:18.290,00:01:20.100
"And we also computed the
derivative of x to the nth",00:01:20.100,00:01:24.870
"power for n = 1, 2, etc.,
and that turned out to be x,",00:01:24.870,00:01:32.097
"I'm sorry, nx^(n-1).",00:01:32.097,00:01:32.930
"So that's what we did
last time, and today I",00:01:36.970,00:01:46.180
"want to finish up with
other points of view",00:01:46.180,00:01:51.580
on what a derivative is.,00:01:51.580,00:01:53.430
"So this is extremely
important, it's",00:01:53.430,00:01:56.250
"almost the most important thing
I'll be saying in the class.",00:01:56.250,00:01:58.750
"But you'll have to think about
it again when you start over",00:01:58.750,00:02:01.310
"and start using calculus
in the real world.",00:02:01.310,00:02:04.600
"So again we're talking
about what is a derivative",00:02:04.600,00:02:14.030
"and this is just a
continuation of last time.",00:02:14.030,00:02:19.660
"So, as I said last time,
we talked about geometric",00:02:19.660,00:02:23.260
"interpretations, and today
what we're gonna talk about",00:02:23.260,00:02:28.130
"is rate of change
as an interpretation",00:02:28.130,00:02:34.310
of the derivative.,00:02:34.310,00:02:40.000
"So remember we drew graphs
of functions, y = f(x)",00:02:40.000,00:02:46.260
"and we kept track of the change
in x and here the change in y,",00:02:46.260,00:02:53.190
let's say.,00:02:53.190,00:02:56.140
"And then from this new point
of view a rate of change,",00:02:56.140,00:03:01.872
"keeping track of the rate
of change of x and the rate",00:03:01.872,00:03:04.080
"of change of y, it's the
relative rate of change",00:03:04.080,00:03:07.030
"we're interested in, and that's
delta y / delta x and that",00:03:07.030,00:03:12.590
has another interpretation.,00:03:12.590,00:03:16.010
This is the average change.,00:03:16.010,00:03:21.650
"Usually we would think of that,
if x were measuring time and so",00:03:21.650,00:03:26.880
"the average and that's
when this becomes a rate,",00:03:26.880,00:03:31.350
"and the average is over
the time interval delta x.",00:03:31.350,00:03:35.830
"And then the limiting
value is denoted dy/dx",00:03:35.830,00:03:42.670
"and so this one is the
average rate of change",00:03:42.670,00:03:47.580
"and this one is the
instantaneous rate.",00:03:47.580,00:03:59.860
"Okay, so that's
the point of view",00:03:59.860,00:04:01.412
"that I'd like to
discuss now and give you",00:04:01.412,00:04:03.120
just a couple of examples.,00:04:03.120,00:04:06.200
"So, let's see.",00:04:06.200,00:04:12.980
"Well, first of all, maybe some
examples from physics here.",00:04:12.980,00:04:19.620
"So q is usually the
name for a charge,",00:04:19.620,00:04:26.450
"and then dq/dt is
what's known as current.",00:04:26.450,00:04:33.660
So that's one physical example.,00:04:33.660,00:04:38.600
"A second example, which is
probably the most tangible one,",00:04:38.600,00:04:45.200
"is we could denote the
letter s by distance",00:04:45.200,00:04:51.500
"and then the rate of change
is what we call speed.",00:04:51.500,00:04:58.520
"So those are the
two typical examples",00:04:58.520,00:05:02.110
"and I just want to
illustrate the second example",00:05:02.110,00:05:06.550
"in a little bit more
detail because I think",00:05:06.550,00:05:08.900
"it's important to have some
visceral sense of this notion",00:05:08.900,00:05:12.690
of instantaneous speed.,00:05:12.690,00:05:16.320
"And I get to use the example of
this very building to do that.",00:05:16.320,00:05:22.570
"Probably you know,
or maybe you don't,",00:05:22.570,00:05:25.860
"that on Halloween
there's an event that",00:05:25.860,00:05:29.690
"takes place in this
building or really",00:05:29.690,00:05:33.042
"from the top of
this building which",00:05:33.042,00:05:34.500
is called the pumpkin drop.,00:05:34.500,00:05:37.000
"So let's illustrates this
idea of rate of change",00:05:37.000,00:05:44.450
with the pumpkin drop.,00:05:44.450,00:05:49.040
"So what happens is,
this building-- well",00:05:49.040,00:05:53.800
"let's see here's the building,
and here's the dot, that's",00:05:53.800,00:06:01.070
"the beautiful grass out on
this side of the building,",00:06:01.070,00:06:04.890
"and then there's
some people up here",00:06:04.890,00:06:09.430
"and very small
objects, well they're",00:06:09.430,00:06:12.310
"not that small when
you're close to them, that",00:06:12.310,00:06:15.240
get dumped over the side there.,00:06:15.240,00:06:19.000
And they fall down.,00:06:19.000,00:06:21.510
"You know everything at MIT
or a lot of things at MIT",00:06:21.510,00:06:24.170
are physics experiments.,00:06:24.170,00:06:28.430
That's the pumpkin drop.,00:06:28.430,00:06:29.440
"So roughly speaking,
the building",00:06:29.440,00:06:32.555
"is about 300 feet
high, we're down here",00:06:32.555,00:06:36.360
on the first usable floor.,00:06:36.360,00:06:39.570
"And so we're going to
use instead of 300 feet,",00:06:39.570,00:06:44.130
"just for convenience
purposes we'll",00:06:44.130,00:06:46.330
"use 80 meters because that makes
the numbers come out simply.",00:06:46.330,00:06:55.410
"So we have the height
which starts out",00:06:55.410,00:07:04.380
"at 80 meters at time 0 and then
the acceleration due to gravity",00:07:04.380,00:07:09.590
"gives you this formula
for h, this is the height.",00:07:09.590,00:07:13.330
"So at time t = 0, we're up
at the top, h is 80 meters,",00:07:13.330,00:07:21.760
the units here are meters.,00:07:21.760,00:07:24.580
"And at time t = 4 you
notice, 5 * 4^2 is 80.",00:07:24.580,00:07:32.200
"I picked these numbers
conveniently so",00:07:32.200,00:07:34.030
that we're down at the bottom.,00:07:34.030,00:07:38.320
"Okay, so this notion
of average change here,",00:07:38.320,00:07:43.620
"so the average change, or
the average speed here,",00:07:43.620,00:07:51.380
"maybe we'll call it
the average speed,",00:07:51.380,00:07:55.636
"since that's-- over this time
that it takes for the pumpkin",00:07:55.636,00:08:02.910
"to drop is going to be
the change in h divided",00:08:02.910,00:08:07.385
by the change in t.,00:08:07.385,00:08:10.170
"Which starts out at, what
does it start out as?",00:08:10.170,00:08:18.350
"It starts out as 80, right?",00:08:18.350,00:08:21.870
And it ends at 0.,00:08:21.870,00:08:23.930
"So actually we have
to do it backwards.",00:08:23.930,00:08:26.520
"We have to take 0 - 80
because the first value is",00:08:26.520,00:08:32.110
"the final position
and the second value",00:08:32.110,00:08:35.500
is the initial position.,00:08:35.500,00:08:37.390
"And that's divided by
4 - 0; times 4 seconds",00:08:37.390,00:08:41.470
minus times 0 seconds.,00:08:41.470,00:08:43.680
"And so that of course is
-20 meters per second.",00:08:43.680,00:08:49.200
"So the average speed of this
guy is 20 meters a second.",00:08:49.200,00:08:56.860
"Now, so why did I
pick this example?",00:08:56.860,00:09:00.970
"Because, of course, the
average, although interesting,",00:09:00.970,00:09:04.480
"is not really what
anybody cares about who",00:09:04.480,00:09:06.540
actually goes to the event.,00:09:06.540,00:09:08.670
"All we really care about
is the instantaneous speed",00:09:08.670,00:09:11.460
"when it hits the pavement
and so that's can",00:09:11.460,00:09:19.005
be calculated at the bottom.,00:09:19.005,00:09:23.610
"So what's the
instantaneous speed?",00:09:23.610,00:09:25.330
"That's the derivative,
or maybe to be",00:09:25.330,00:09:29.530
"consistent with the notation
I've been using so far,",00:09:29.530,00:09:31.720
that's d/dt of h.,00:09:31.720,00:09:35.950
All right?,00:09:35.950,00:09:37.580
So that's d/dt of h.,00:09:37.580,00:09:39.090
"Now remember we have
formulas for these things.",00:09:39.090,00:09:42.020
"We can differentiate
this function now.",00:09:42.020,00:09:43.850
We did that yesterday.,00:09:43.850,00:09:47.930
"So we're gonna take the rate of
change and if you take a look",00:09:47.930,00:09:51.350
"at it, it's just the rate
of change of 80 is 0,",00:09:51.350,00:09:56.790
"minus the rate change for
this -5t^2, that's minus 10t.",00:09:56.790,00:10:02.860
"So that's using the fact
that d/dt of 80 is equal to 0",00:10:02.860,00:10:08.750
and d/dt of t^2 is equal to 2t.,00:10:08.750,00:10:12.350
The special case...,00:10:12.350,00:10:14.420
"Well I'm cheating
here, but there's",00:10:14.420,00:10:17.160
a special case that's obvious.,00:10:17.160,00:10:18.500
I didn't throw it in over here.,00:10:18.500,00:10:19.850
"The case n = 2 is that
second case there.",00:10:19.850,00:10:23.750
But the case n = 0 also works.,00:10:23.750,00:10:30.380
Because that's constants.,00:10:30.380,00:10:31.534
"The derivative of
a constant is 0.",00:10:31.534,00:10:32.950
"And then the factor n there's
0 and that's consistent.",00:10:32.950,00:10:36.781
"And actually if you look
at the formula above it",00:10:36.781,00:10:38.780
"you'll see that it's
the case of n = -1.",00:10:38.780,00:10:44.090
"So we'll get a larger pattern
soon enough with the powers.",00:10:44.090,00:10:49.820
Okay anyway.,00:10:49.820,00:10:50.450
"Back over here we have
our rate of change",00:10:50.450,00:10:53.770
and this is what it is.,00:10:53.770,00:10:55.380
"And at the bottom, at
that point of impact,",00:10:55.380,00:10:59.350
"we have t = 4 and so h',
which is the derivative,",00:10:59.350,00:11:04.700
"is equal to -40
meters per second.",00:11:04.700,00:11:12.860
"So twice as fast as
the average speed here,",00:11:12.860,00:11:16.540
"and if you need to convert that,
that's about 90 miles an hour.",00:11:16.540,00:11:22.900
"Which is why the police are
there at midnight on Halloween",00:11:22.900,00:11:29.450
"to make sure you're all safe
and also why when you come",00:11:29.450,00:11:33.310
"you have to be prepared
to clean up afterwards.",00:11:33.310,00:11:37.330
"So anyway that's what happens,
it's 90 miles an hour.",00:11:37.330,00:11:40.260
"It's actually the
buildings a little taller,",00:11:40.260,00:11:42.320
"there's air resistance
and I'm sure you",00:11:42.320,00:11:45.010
"can do a much more thorough
study of this example.",00:11:45.010,00:11:50.350
"All right so now I want to give
you a couple of more examples",00:11:50.350,00:11:54.300
"because time and these kinds
of parameters and variables",00:11:54.300,00:11:58.700
"are not the only ones that
are important for calculus.",00:11:58.700,00:12:02.570
"If it were only this kind of
physics that was involved,",00:12:02.570,00:12:05.610
"then this would be a much more
specialized subject than it is.",00:12:05.610,00:12:09.710
"And so I want to give you a
couple of examples that don't",00:12:09.710,00:12:13.340
involve time as a variable.,00:12:13.340,00:12:16.570
"So the third example
I'll give here",00:12:16.570,00:12:20.175
"is-- The letter T often
denotes temperature,",00:12:20.175,00:12:27.260
"and then dT/dx would be what
is known as the temperature",00:12:27.260,00:12:35.660
gradient.,00:12:35.660,00:12:38.830
"Which we really care
about a lot when",00:12:38.830,00:12:43.310
"we're predicting the weather
because it's that temperature",00:12:43.310,00:12:45.820
"difference that causes air flows
and causes things to change.",00:12:45.820,00:12:52.140
"And then there's
another theme which",00:12:52.140,00:12:54.410
"is throughout the sciences
and engineering which",00:12:54.410,00:13:01.110
"I'm going to talk about under
the heading of sensitivity",00:13:01.110,00:13:07.700
of measurements.,00:13:07.700,00:13:15.600
So let me explain this.,00:13:15.600,00:13:18.470
"I don't want to belabor
it because I just",00:13:18.470,00:13:21.530
"am doing this in
order to introduce you",00:13:21.530,00:13:23.810
"to the ideas on your
problem set which",00:13:23.810,00:13:26.380
are the first case of this.,00:13:26.380,00:13:29.350
"So on problem set one
you have an example",00:13:29.350,00:13:33.290
"which is based on a
simplified model of GPS,",00:13:33.290,00:13:37.360
sort of the Flat Earth Model.,00:13:37.360,00:13:39.550
"And in that situation,
well, if the Earth is flat",00:13:39.550,00:13:42.400
"it's just a horizontal
line like this.",00:13:42.400,00:13:45.490
"And then you have a satellite,
which is over here, preferably",00:13:45.490,00:13:54.020
"above the earth, and the
satellite or the system",00:13:54.020,00:14:02.440
"knows exactly where the point
directly below the satellite",00:14:02.440,00:14:05.810
is.,00:14:05.810,00:14:06.480
"So this point is
treated as known.",00:14:06.480,00:14:12.170
"And I'm sitting here
with my little GPS device",00:14:12.170,00:14:22.160
and I want to know where I am.,00:14:22.160,00:14:26.440
"And the way I
locate where I am is",00:14:26.440,00:14:28.880
"I communicate with this
satellite by radio signals",00:14:28.880,00:14:34.750
"and I can measure this distance
here which is called h.",00:14:34.750,00:14:38.750
"And then system will compute
this horizontal distance which",00:14:38.750,00:14:45.060
"is L. So in other
words what is measured,",00:14:45.060,00:14:53.360
"so h measured by radios,
radio waves and a clock,",00:14:53.360,00:15:03.020
or various clocks.,00:15:03.020,00:15:04.910
And then L is deduced from h.,00:15:04.910,00:15:13.560
"And what's critical in
all of these systems",00:15:13.560,00:15:16.730
"is that you don't
know h exactly.",00:15:16.730,00:15:20.320
"There's an error in h
which will denote delta h.",00:15:20.320,00:15:26.330
"There's some degree
of uncertainty.",00:15:26.330,00:15:31.040
"The main uncertainty in
GPS is from the ionosphere.",00:15:31.040,00:15:35.550
"But there are lots
of corrections",00:15:35.550,00:15:38.280
that are made of all kinds.,00:15:38.280,00:15:41.340
"And also if you're
inside a building",00:15:41.340,00:15:43.570
it's a problem to measure it.,00:15:43.570,00:15:44.790
"But it's an extremely
important issue,",00:15:44.790,00:15:47.970
as I'll explain in a second.,00:15:47.970,00:15:49.730
"So the idea is we
then get at delta",00:15:49.730,00:15:54.040
"L is estimated by considering
this ratio delta L/delta",00:15:54.040,00:16:04.246
"h which is going
to be approximately",00:16:04.246,00:16:07.060
"the same as the derivative
of L with respect to h.",00:16:07.060,00:16:13.910
"So this is the thing that's
easy because of course it's",00:16:13.910,00:16:17.815
calculus.,00:16:17.815,00:16:18.940
"Calculus is the
easy part and that",00:16:18.940,00:16:21.960
"allows us to deduce something
about the real world that's",00:16:21.960,00:16:25.330
close by over here.,00:16:25.330,00:16:28.600
"So the reason why you should
care about this quite a bit",00:16:28.600,00:16:31.980
"is that it's used all the
time to land airplanes.",00:16:31.980,00:16:34.870
"So you really do care
that they actually",00:16:34.870,00:16:36.680
"know to within a few feet or
even closer where your plane is",00:16:36.680,00:16:42.386
"and how high up it
is and so forth.",00:16:42.386,00:16:48.150
All right.,00:16:48.150,00:16:48.650
"So that's it for the
general introduction",00:16:48.650,00:16:50.850
of what a derivative is.,00:16:50.850,00:16:52.010
"I'm sure you'll be
getting used to this",00:16:52.010,00:16:53.670
"in a lot of different contexts
throughout the course.",00:16:53.670,00:16:56.560
"And now we have to get back
down to some rigorous details.",00:16:56.560,00:17:04.510
"Okay, everybody happy with
what we've got so far?",00:17:04.510,00:17:09.540
Yeah?,00:17:09.540,00:17:10.040
"Student: How did you get
the equation for height?",00:17:10.040,00:17:13.400
Professor: Ah good question.,00:17:13.400,00:17:14.980
"The question was how did I
get this equation for height?",00:17:14.980,00:17:18.560
"I just made it up because
it's the formula from physics",00:17:18.560,00:17:24.970
"that you will learn when
you take 8.01 and, in fact,",00:17:24.970,00:17:29.592
"it has to do with the fact
that this is the speed if you",00:17:29.592,00:17:35.060
"differentiate
another time you get",00:17:35.060,00:17:37.340
"acceleration and
acceleration due to gravity",00:17:37.340,00:17:40.550
is 10 meters per second.,00:17:40.550,00:17:42.330
"Which happens to be the
second derivative of this.",00:17:42.330,00:17:44.450
"But anyway I just pulled it
out of a hat from your physics",00:17:44.450,00:17:47.710
class.,00:17:47.710,00:17:48.350
So you can just say see 8.01 .,00:17:48.350,00:17:55.510
"All right, other questions?",00:17:55.510,00:18:02.840
"All right, so let's go on now.",00:18:02.840,00:18:04.970
"Now I have to be a little bit
more systematic about limits.",00:18:04.970,00:18:09.340
So let's do that now.,00:18:09.340,00:18:20.130
"So now what I'd like to talk
about is limits and continuity.",00:18:20.130,00:18:30.370
"And this is a warm
up for deriving",00:18:30.370,00:18:34.200
"all the rest of the formulas,
all the rest of the formulas",00:18:34.200,00:18:37.900
"that I'm going to
need to differentiate",00:18:37.900,00:18:40.430
every function you know.,00:18:40.430,00:18:41.600
"Remember, that's our goal
and we only have about a week",00:18:41.600,00:18:44.120
left so we'd better get started.,00:18:44.120,00:18:47.510
"So first of all there is
what I will call easy limits.",00:18:47.510,00:18:58.980
So what's an easy limit?,00:18:58.980,00:19:00.650
"An easy limit is something like
the limit as x goes to 4 of x",00:19:00.650,00:19:07.285
plus 3 over x^2 + 1.,00:19:07.285,00:19:11.570
"And with this kind of limit all
I have to do to evaluate it is",00:19:11.570,00:19:16.240
"to plug in x = 4 because,
so what I get here is 4 + 3",00:19:16.240,00:19:23.770
divided by 4^2 + 1.,00:19:23.770,00:19:27.900
And that's just 7 / 17.,00:19:27.900,00:19:31.560
And that's the end of it.,00:19:31.560,00:19:33.720
So those are the easy limits.,00:19:33.720,00:19:38.510
"The second kind of limit -
well so this isn't the only",00:19:38.510,00:19:42.669
"second kind of limit but I
just want to point this out,",00:19:42.669,00:19:44.960
"it's very important - is that:
derivatives are are always",00:19:44.960,00:19:55.680
harder than this.,00:19:55.680,00:19:59.370
"You can't get away
with nothing here.",00:19:59.370,00:20:03.230
"So, why is that?",00:20:03.230,00:20:05.090
"Well, when you
take a derivative,",00:20:05.090,00:20:07.620
"you're taking the limit
as x goes to x_0 of f(x),",00:20:07.620,00:20:13.160
"well we'll write it all
out in all its glory.",00:20:13.160,00:20:24.520
"Here's the formula
for the derivative.",00:20:24.520,00:20:28.790
"Now notice that if you plug in
x = x:0, always gives 0 / 0.",00:20:28.790,00:20:39.110
"So it just basically
never works.",00:20:39.110,00:20:42.080
"So we always are going
to need some cancellation",00:20:42.080,00:20:50.940
to make sense out of the limit.,00:20:50.940,00:21:05.960
"Now in order to make things
a little easier for myself",00:21:05.960,00:21:12.570
"to explain what's
going on with limits",00:21:12.570,00:21:15.700
"I need to introduce just
one more piece of notation.",00:21:15.700,00:21:18.660
"What I'm gonna
introduce here is what's",00:21:18.660,00:21:20.490
"known as a left-hand
and a right limit.",00:21:20.490,00:21:23.380
"If I take the limit as x tends
to x_0 with a plus sign here",00:21:23.380,00:21:29.500
"of some function, this is what's
known as the right-hand limit.",00:21:29.500,00:21:42.280
And I can display it visually.,00:21:42.280,00:21:44.870
So what does this mean?,00:21:44.870,00:21:45.950
"It means practically
the same thing",00:21:45.950,00:21:47.530
"as x tends to x_0 except there
is one more restriction which",00:21:47.530,00:21:51.160
"has to do with this plus
sign, which is we're going",00:21:51.160,00:21:53.630
from the plus side of x_0.,00:21:53.630,00:21:55.370
That means x is bigger than x_0.,00:21:55.370,00:21:58.710
"And I say right-hand, so
there should be a hyphen here,",00:21:58.710,00:22:01.770
"right-hand limit because
on the number line,",00:22:01.770,00:22:06.600
"if x_0 is over here
the x is to the right.",00:22:06.600,00:22:14.580
All right?,00:22:14.580,00:22:15.080
So that's the right-hand limit.,00:22:15.080,00:22:16.750
"And then this being the
left side of the board,",00:22:16.750,00:22:19.550
"I'll put on the right side
of the board the left limit,",00:22:19.550,00:22:22.716
just to make things confusing.,00:22:22.716,00:22:24.560
"So that one has the
minus sign here.",00:22:24.560,00:22:30.520
"I'm just a little dyslexic
and I hope you're not.",00:22:30.520,00:22:33.940
So I may have gotten that wrong.,00:22:33.940,00:22:38.200
"So this is the left-hand
limit, and I'll draw it.",00:22:38.200,00:22:41.510
"So of course that just
means x goes to x_0 but x is",00:22:41.510,00:22:45.705
to the left of x_0 .,00:22:45.705,00:22:48.260
"And again, on the number
line, here's the x_0",00:22:48.260,00:22:52.290
"and the x is on the
other side of it.",00:22:52.290,00:22:56.570
"Okay, so those two
notations are going",00:22:56.570,00:22:58.970
"to help us to clarify
a bunch of things.",00:22:58.970,00:23:01.830
"It's much more
convenient to have",00:23:01.830,00:23:04.580
"this extra bit of
description of limits",00:23:04.580,00:23:08.520
"than to just consider
limits from both sides.",00:23:08.520,00:23:15.880
"Okay so I want to give
an example of this.",00:23:15.880,00:23:25.980
"And also an example
of how you're going to",00:23:25.980,00:23:29.310
"think about these
sorts of problems.",00:23:29.310,00:23:32.110
"So I'll take a function which
has two different definitions.",00:23:32.110,00:23:38.020
"Say it's x + 1, when x &gt;
0 and -x + 2, when x &lt; 0.",00:23:38.020,00:23:47.570
So maybe put commas there.,00:23:47.570,00:23:51.280
"So when x &gt; 0, it's x + 1.",00:23:51.280,00:23:58.540
"Now I can draw a
picture of this.",00:23:58.540,00:24:01.030
"It's gonna be kind
of a little small",00:24:01.030,00:24:02.955
"because I'm gonna try
to fit it down in here,",00:24:02.955,00:24:04.830
"but maybe I'll put
the axis down below.",00:24:04.830,00:24:07.670
"So at height 1, I have to
the right something of slope",00:24:07.670,00:24:13.990
1 so it goes up like this.,00:24:13.990,00:24:16.890
All right?,00:24:16.890,00:24:18.240
"And then to the left of 0 I have
something which has slope -1,",00:24:18.240,00:24:26.500
"but it hits the axis
at 2 so it's up here.",00:24:26.500,00:24:30.720
"So I had this sort of
strange antenna figure here,",00:24:30.720,00:24:34.175
which is my graph.,00:24:34.175,00:24:35.150
"Maybe I should draw these in
another color to depict that.",00:24:35.150,00:24:43.710
"And then if I calculate
these two limits here,",00:24:43.710,00:24:47.780
"what I see is that
the limit as x",00:24:47.780,00:24:54.670
"goes to 0 from above of f(x),
that's the same as the limit",00:24:54.670,00:25:00.860
"as x goes to 0 of the
formula here, x + 1.",00:25:00.860,00:25:07.990
Which turns out to be 1.,00:25:07.990,00:25:10.430
"And if I take the limit, so
that's the left-hand limit.",00:25:10.430,00:25:15.360
"Sorry, I told you
I was dyslexic.",00:25:15.360,00:25:20.700
"This is the right, so
it's that right-hand.",00:25:20.700,00:25:23.320
Here we go.,00:25:23.320,00:25:25.080
"So now I'm going from the
left, and it's f(x) again,",00:25:25.080,00:25:31.530
"but now because I'm on that
side the thing I need to plug",00:25:31.530,00:25:35.180
"is the other formula, -x + 2,
and that's gonna give us 2.",00:25:35.180,00:25:43.540
"Now, notice that the left
and right limits, and this",00:25:43.540,00:25:48.310
"is one little tiny subtlety
and it's almost the only thing",00:25:48.310,00:25:51.470
"that I need you to really
pay attention to a little bit",00:25:51.470,00:25:53.770
"right now, is that this, we
did not need x = 0 value.",00:25:53.770,00:26:06.210
"In fact I never even told
you what f(0) was here.",00:26:06.210,00:26:11.860
"If we stick it in we
could stick it in.",00:26:11.860,00:26:14.650
"Okay let's say we stick
it in on this side.",00:26:14.650,00:26:20.050
"Let's make it be that
it's on this side.",00:26:20.050,00:26:22.970
"So that means that this point
is in and this point is out.",00:26:22.970,00:26:32.860
"So that's a typical notation:
this little open circle",00:26:32.860,00:26:37.680
"and this closed dot for
when you include the.",00:26:37.680,00:26:41.530
"So in that case
the value of f(x)",00:26:41.530,00:26:44.830
"happens to be the same
as its right-hand limit,",00:26:44.830,00:26:48.360
"namely the value is
1 here and not 2.",00:26:48.360,00:26:56.530
"Okay, so that's the
first kind of example.",00:26:56.530,00:27:01.140
Questions?,00:27:01.140,00:27:06.610
"Okay, so now our next
job is to introduce",00:27:06.610,00:27:13.420
the definition of continuity.,00:27:13.420,00:27:17.270
"So that was the
other topic here.",00:27:17.270,00:27:20.080
So we're going to define.,00:27:20.080,00:27:23.490
"So f is continuous at x_0 means
that the limit of f(x) as x",00:27:23.490,00:27:39.515
"tends to x_0 is
equal to f(x_0) .",00:27:39.515,00:27:44.440
Right?,00:27:44.440,00:27:47.090
"So the reason why I spend
all this time paying",00:27:47.090,00:27:51.750
"attention to the left and the
right and so on and so forth",00:27:51.750,00:27:54.540
"and focusing is that I want you
to pay attention for one moment",00:27:54.540,00:27:57.340
"to what the content
of this definition is.",00:27:57.340,00:28:01.820
"What it's saying is the
following: continuous at x_0",00:28:01.820,00:28:12.640
has various ingredients here.,00:28:12.640,00:28:15.450
"So the first one is
that this limit exists.",00:28:15.450,00:28:24.540
"And what that means
is that there's",00:28:24.540,00:28:27.080
"an honest limiting value
both from the left and right.",00:28:27.080,00:28:35.150
"And they also have
to be the same.",00:28:35.150,00:28:39.250
"All right, so that's
what's going on here.",00:28:39.250,00:28:41.980
"And the second property
is that f(x_0) is defined.",00:28:41.980,00:28:50.380
"So I can't be in one
of these situations",00:28:50.380,00:28:52.100
"where I haven't
even specified what",00:28:52.100,00:28:54.770
f(x_0) is and they're equal.,00:28:54.770,00:29:05.220
"Okay, so that's the situation.",00:29:05.220,00:29:09.190
"Now again let me
emphasize a tricky part",00:29:09.190,00:29:13.310
of the definition of a limit.,00:29:13.310,00:29:15.560
"This side, the left-hand side
is completely independent,",00:29:15.560,00:29:20.320
"is evaluated by a
procedure which does not",00:29:20.320,00:29:23.790
involve the right-hand side.,00:29:23.790,00:29:25.070
These are separate things.,00:29:25.070,00:29:26.900
"This one is, to evaluate it, you
always avoid the limit point.",00:29:26.900,00:29:34.310
"So that's if you like a
paradox, because it's exactly",00:29:34.310,00:29:37.670
"the question: is it true
that if you plug in x_0",00:29:37.670,00:29:41.290
"you get the same answer as
if you move in the limit?",00:29:41.290,00:29:44.300
"That's the issue that
we're considering here.",00:29:44.300,00:29:46.270
"We have to make that
distinction in order",00:29:46.270,00:29:48.270
"to say that these
are two, otherwise",00:29:48.270,00:29:50.880
this is just tautological.,00:29:50.880,00:29:55.270
It doesn't have any meaning.,00:29:55.270,00:29:56.630
"But in fact it
does have a meaning",00:29:56.630,00:29:58.046
"because one thing is evaluated
separately with reference",00:29:58.046,00:30:00.620
"to all the other
points and the other",00:30:00.620,00:30:03.850
"is evaluated right at
the point in question.",00:30:03.850,00:30:06.870
"And indeed what
these things are,",00:30:06.870,00:30:11.090
are exactly the easy limits.,00:30:11.090,00:30:17.896
"That's exactly what
we're talking about here.",00:30:17.896,00:30:19.770
"They're the ones you
can evaluate this way.",00:30:19.770,00:30:24.150
"So we have to make
the distinction.",00:30:24.150,00:30:25.640
"And these other ones are
gonna be the ones which",00:30:25.640,00:30:27.685
we can't evaluate that way.,00:30:27.685,00:30:29.670
"So these are the
nice ones and that's",00:30:29.670,00:30:31.540
"why we care about them, why
we have a whole definition",00:30:31.540,00:30:33.830
associated with them.,00:30:33.830,00:30:36.470
All right?,00:30:36.470,00:30:38.700
So now what's next?,00:30:38.700,00:30:40.400
"Well, I need to give you a a
little tour, very brief tour,",00:30:40.400,00:30:48.910
"of the zoo of what are known
as discontinuous functions.",00:30:48.910,00:30:54.090
"So sort of everything else
that's not continuous.",00:30:54.090,00:30:57.430
"So, the first example here,
let me just write it down here.",00:30:57.430,00:31:04.550
It's jump discontinuities.,00:31:04.550,00:31:13.670
"So what would a jump
discontinuity be?",00:31:13.670,00:31:15.300
"Well we've actually
already seen it.",00:31:15.300,00:31:18.730
"The jump discontinuity
is the example",00:31:18.730,00:31:21.790
that we had right there.,00:31:21.790,00:31:23.230
"This is when the limit
from the left and right",00:31:23.230,00:31:32.490
"exist, but are not equal.",00:31:32.490,00:31:42.180
"Okay, so that's
as in the example.",00:31:42.180,00:31:50.940
Right?,00:31:50.940,00:31:51.440
"In this example, the
two limits, one of them",00:31:51.440,00:31:53.680
was 1 and of them was 2.,00:31:53.680,00:31:57.890
So that's a jump discontinuity.,00:31:57.890,00:32:02.150
"And this kind of issue,
of whether something",00:32:02.150,00:32:09.310
"is continuous or not, may
seem a little bit technical",00:32:09.310,00:32:14.940
"but it is true that people
have worried about it a lot.",00:32:14.940,00:32:26.120
"Bob Merton, who was a
professor at MIT when",00:32:26.120,00:32:28.820
"he did his work for the
Nobel prize in economics,",00:32:28.820,00:32:33.410
"was interested in
this very issue",00:32:33.410,00:32:36.180
"of whether stock
prices of various kinds",00:32:36.180,00:32:39.320
"are continuous from the left
or right in a certain model.",00:32:39.320,00:32:42.540
"And that was a
very serious issue",00:32:42.540,00:32:44.580
"in developing the model
that priced things",00:32:44.580,00:32:49.150
"that our hedge funds
use all the time now.",00:32:49.150,00:32:51.840
"So left and right can really
mean something very different.",00:32:51.840,00:32:57.630
"In this case left is the
past and right is the future",00:32:57.630,00:33:01.507
"and it makes a big
difference whether things",00:33:01.507,00:33:03.340
"are continuous from the left
or continuous from the right.",00:33:03.340,00:33:06.840
"Right, is it true that
the point is here,",00:33:06.840,00:33:09.120
"here, somewhere in the
middle, somewhere else.",00:33:09.120,00:33:11.720
That's a serious issue.,00:33:11.720,00:33:13.480
"So the next example
that I want to give you",00:33:13.480,00:33:18.210
is a little bit more subtle.,00:33:18.210,00:33:22.720
"It's what's known as a
removable discontinuity.",00:33:22.720,00:33:32.140
"And so what this means is that
the limit from left and right",00:33:32.140,00:33:43.010
are equal.,00:33:43.010,00:33:46.190
"So a picture of
that would be, you",00:33:46.190,00:33:47.980
"have a function which is
coming along like this",00:33:47.980,00:33:50.480
"and there's a hole
maybe where, who knows",00:33:50.480,00:33:52.820
"either the function is undefined
or maybe it's defined up here,",00:33:52.820,00:33:56.270
and then it just continues on.,00:33:56.270,00:33:58.751
All right?,00:33:58.751,00:33:59.250
So the two limits are the same.,00:33:59.250,00:34:01.210
"And then of course the function
is begging to be redefined",00:34:01.210,00:34:05.010
so that we remove that hole.,00:34:05.010,00:34:07.370
"And that's why it's called
a removable discontinuity.",00:34:07.370,00:34:14.470
"Now let me give you
an example of this,",00:34:14.470,00:34:17.710
"or actually a
couple of examples.",00:34:17.710,00:34:22.460
"So these are quite
important examples",00:34:22.460,00:34:28.130
"which you will be working
with in a few minutes.",00:34:28.130,00:34:34.020
"So the first is the function
g(x), which is sin x / x,",00:34:34.020,00:34:41.660
"and the second will be the
function h(x), which is 1 -",00:34:41.660,00:34:45.260
cos x over x.,00:34:45.260,00:34:50.520
"So we have a problem at
g(0), g(0) is undefined.",00:34:50.520,00:35:00.290
"On the other hand it turns
out this function has what's",00:35:00.290,00:35:03.760
called a removable singularity.,00:35:03.760,00:35:05.710
"Namely the limit as x goes
to 0 of sin x / x does exist.",00:35:05.710,00:35:14.630
In fact it's equal to 1.,00:35:14.630,00:35:17.050
"So that's a very important limit
that we will work out either",00:35:17.050,00:35:20.430
"at the end of this lecture or
the beginning of next lecture.",00:35:20.430,00:35:23.420
"And similarly, the
limit of 1 - cos x",00:35:23.420,00:35:30.940
"divided by x, as
x goes to 0, is 0.",00:35:30.940,00:35:35.370
"Maybe I'll put that
a little farther",00:35:35.370,00:35:38.051
away so you can read it.,00:35:38.051,00:35:40.360
"Okay, so these are
very useful facts",00:35:40.360,00:35:44.940
"that we're going
to need later on.",00:35:44.940,00:35:47.800
"And what they say is
that these things have",00:35:47.800,00:35:50.460
"removable singularities, sorry
removable discontinuity at x",00:35:50.460,00:35:58.520
= 0.,00:35:58.520,00:36:04.600
"All right so as I say, we'll
get to that in a few minutes.",00:36:04.600,00:36:13.030
"Okay so are there any
questions before I move on?",00:36:13.030,00:36:16.400
Yeah?,00:36:16.400,00:36:16.900
Student: [INAUDIBLE],00:36:16.900,00:36:30.630
"Professor: The question
is: why is this true?",00:36:30.630,00:36:38.300
Is that what your question is?,00:36:38.300,00:36:40.300
"The answer is it's
very, very unobvious,",00:36:40.300,00:36:44.070
"I haven't shown it to you
yet, and if you were not",00:36:44.070,00:36:48.360
"surprised by it then that
would be very strange indeed.",00:36:48.360,00:36:51.560
So we haven't done it yet.,00:36:51.560,00:36:53.390
"You have to stay
tuned until we do.",00:36:53.390,00:36:55.990
Okay?,00:36:55.990,00:36:57.210
We haven't shown it yet.,00:36:57.210,00:36:59.250
"And actually even
this other statement,",00:36:59.250,00:37:01.320
"which maybe seems
stranger still,",00:37:01.320,00:37:03.600
is also not yet explained.,00:37:03.600,00:37:05.760
"Okay, so we are going
to get there, as I said,",00:37:05.760,00:37:08.865
"either at the end
of this lecture",00:37:08.865,00:37:10.240
or at the beginning of next.,00:37:10.240,00:37:15.410
Other questions?,00:37:15.410,00:37:22.560
"All right, so let me
just continue my tour",00:37:22.560,00:37:28.180
of the zoo of discontinuities.,00:37:28.180,00:37:34.000
"And, I guess, I want
to illustrate something",00:37:34.000,00:37:37.050
"with the convenience of
right and left hand limits",00:37:37.050,00:37:41.440
"so I'll save this board about
right and left-hand limits.",00:37:41.440,00:37:52.180
"So a third type of
discontinuity is",00:37:52.180,00:37:54.970
"what's known as an
infinite discontinuity.",00:37:54.970,00:38:07.320
"And we've already
encountered one of these.",00:38:07.320,00:38:11.950
"I'm going to draw
them over here.",00:38:11.950,00:38:14.450
"Remember the
function y is 1 / x.",00:38:14.450,00:38:19.370
That's this function here.,00:38:19.370,00:38:22.450
"But now I'd like to draw
also the other branch",00:38:22.450,00:38:25.500
"of the hyperbola down here
and allow myself to consider",00:38:25.500,00:38:31.140
negative values of x.,00:38:31.140,00:38:32.320
So here's the graph of 1 / x.,00:38:32.320,00:38:35.910
"And the convenience here
of distinguishing the left",00:38:35.910,00:38:42.640
"and the right hand limits is
very important because here I",00:38:42.640,00:38:46.620
"can write down that the limit
as x goes to 0+ of 1 / x.",00:38:46.620,00:38:51.800
"Well that's coming from the
right and it's going up.",00:38:51.800,00:38:57.300
So this limit is infinity.,00:38:57.300,00:39:00.580
"Whereas, the limit in
the other direction,",00:39:00.580,00:39:05.380
"from the left, that
one is going down.",00:39:05.380,00:39:10.630
"And so it's quite different,
it's minus infinity.",00:39:10.630,00:39:16.510
"Now some people say that
these limits are undefined",00:39:16.510,00:39:19.860
"but actually they're going in
some very definite direction.",00:39:19.860,00:39:22.940
"So you should,
whenever possible,",00:39:22.940,00:39:24.950
specify what these limits are.,00:39:24.950,00:39:26.640
"On the other hand, the
statement that the limit",00:39:26.640,00:39:30.860
"as x goes to 0 of 1 / x is
infinity is simply wrong.",00:39:30.860,00:39:37.250
"Okay, it's not that
people don't write this.",00:39:37.250,00:39:40.340
It's just that it's wrong.,00:39:40.340,00:39:41.680
"It's not that they
don't write it down.",00:39:41.680,00:39:43.470
In fact you'll probably see it.,00:39:43.470,00:39:45.000
"It's because people are just
thinking of the right hand",00:39:45.000,00:39:48.055
branch.,00:39:48.055,00:39:48.790
"It's not that they're making
a mistake necessarily,",00:39:48.790,00:39:51.220
"but anyway, it's sloppy.",00:39:51.220,00:39:53.116
"And there's some sloppiness
that we'll endure",00:39:53.116,00:39:54.990
"and others that
we'll try to avoid.",00:39:54.990,00:39:57.080
"So here, you want to say this,
and it does make a difference.",00:39:57.080,00:40:00.120
"You know, plus infinity is
an infinite number of dollars",00:40:00.120,00:40:04.990
"and minus infinity is and
infinite amount of debt.",00:40:04.990,00:40:07.450
They're actually different.,00:40:07.450,00:40:08.980
They're not the same.,00:40:08.980,00:40:09.890
"So, you know, this is sloppy and
this is actually more correct.",00:40:09.890,00:40:15.540
"Okay, so now in
addition, I just want",00:40:15.540,00:40:17.885
to point out one more thing.,00:40:17.885,00:40:21.350
"Remember, we calculated
the derivative,",00:40:21.350,00:40:24.210
and that was -1/x^2.,00:40:24.210,00:40:26.880
"But, I want to draw
the graph of that",00:40:26.880,00:40:31.196
"and make a few
comments about it.",00:40:31.196,00:40:32.570
"So I'm going to draw
the graph directly",00:40:32.570,00:40:34.420
"underneath the graph
of the function.",00:40:34.420,00:40:38.820
And notice what this graphs is.,00:40:38.820,00:40:41.290
"It goes like this, it's always
negative, and it points down.",00:40:41.290,00:40:48.530
"So now this may look
a little strange,",00:40:48.530,00:40:51.480
"that the derivative of
this thing is this guy,",00:40:51.480,00:40:55.080
"but that's because of
something very important.",00:40:55.080,00:40:58.630
"And you should always remember
this about derivatives.",00:40:58.630,00:41:01.030
"The derivative function looks
nothing like the function,",00:41:01.030,00:41:03.995
necessarily.,00:41:03.995,00:41:04.860
"So you should just forget
about that as being an idea.",00:41:04.860,00:41:07.780
"Some people feel like
if one thing goes down,",00:41:07.780,00:41:10.040
the other thing has to go down.,00:41:10.040,00:41:11.470
Just forget that intuition.,00:41:11.470,00:41:13.030
It's wrong.,00:41:13.030,00:41:14.160
"What we're dealing with here,
if you remember, is the slope.",00:41:14.160,00:41:20.170
"So if you have a slope
here, that corresponds",00:41:20.170,00:41:23.870
"to just a place over
here and as the slope",00:41:23.870,00:41:26.960
"gets a little bit
less steep, that's",00:41:26.960,00:41:30.190
"why we're approaching
the horizontal axis.",00:41:30.190,00:41:33.320
"The number is getting a
little smaller as we close in.",00:41:33.320,00:41:36.480
"Now over here, the
slope is also negative.",00:41:36.480,00:41:41.120
"It is going down and
as we get down here",00:41:41.120,00:41:42.980
"it's getting more
and more negative.",00:41:42.980,00:41:44.580
"As we go here the slope,
this function is going up,",00:41:44.580,00:41:48.170
but its slope is going down.,00:41:48.170,00:41:50.050
"All right, so the slope is down
on both sides and the notation",00:41:50.050,00:41:55.790
"that we use for that is
well suited to this left",00:41:55.790,00:42:03.690
and right business.,00:42:03.690,00:42:09.410
"Namely, the limit as x
goes to 0 of -1 / x^2,",00:42:09.410,00:42:16.030
"that's going to be
equal to minus infinity.",00:42:16.030,00:42:18.140
"And that applies to x going
to 0+ and x going to 0-.",00:42:18.140,00:42:24.760
So both have this property.,00:42:24.760,00:42:31.780
"Finally let me just
make one last comment",00:42:31.780,00:42:34.040
about these two graphs.,00:42:34.040,00:42:37.660
"This function here
is an odd function",00:42:37.660,00:42:42.220
"and when you take the
derivative of an odd function",00:42:42.220,00:42:44.620
you always get an even function.,00:42:44.620,00:42:50.740
"That's closely related to the
fact that this 1 / x is an odd",00:42:50.740,00:42:54.380
"power and-- x^1 is an odd
power and x^2 is an even power.",00:42:54.380,00:43:01.170
"So all of this your intuition
should be reinforcing the fact",00:43:01.170,00:43:05.620
that these pictures look right.,00:43:05.620,00:43:11.070
"Okay, now there's one
last kind of discontinuity",00:43:11.070,00:43:16.010
"that I want to mention
briefly, which I will call",00:43:16.010,00:43:20.460
other ugly discontinuities.,00:43:20.460,00:43:33.990
"And there are lots
and lots of them.",00:43:33.990,00:43:39.770
"So one example would
be the function y = sin",00:43:39.770,00:43:44.220
"1 / x, as x goes to 0.",00:43:44.220,00:43:50.080
"And that looks a
little bit like this.",00:43:50.080,00:43:58.914
"Back and forth and
back and forth.",00:43:58.914,00:44:00.330
"It oscillates infinitely
often as we tend to 0.",00:44:00.330,00:44:06.170
"There's no left or right
limit in this case.",00:44:06.170,00:44:19.260
"So there is a very large
quantity of things like that.",00:44:19.260,00:44:25.330
"Fortunately we're not gonna
deal with them in this course.",00:44:25.330,00:44:29.350
"A lot of times in
real life there",00:44:29.350,00:44:31.500
"are things that oscillate
as time goes to infinity,",00:44:31.500,00:44:34.800
"but we're not going to
worry about that right now.",00:44:34.800,00:44:40.180
"Okay, so that's our final
mention of a discontinuity,",00:44:40.180,00:44:49.090
"and now I need to do just
one more piece of groundwork",00:44:49.090,00:44:54.130
for our formulas next time.,00:44:54.130,00:44:59.360
"Namely, I want to check
for you one basic fact,",00:44:59.360,00:45:09.130
one limiting tool.,00:45:09.130,00:45:10.280
"So this is going
to be a theorem.",00:45:10.280,00:45:12.960
"Fortunately it's a
very short theorem",00:45:12.960,00:45:17.450
and has a very short proof.,00:45:17.450,00:45:19.580
"So the theorem goes under
the name differentiable",00:45:19.580,00:45:22.090
implies continuous.,00:45:22.090,00:45:28.210
"And what it says
is the following:",00:45:28.210,00:45:30.190
"it says that if f is
differentiable, in other words",00:45:30.190,00:45:35.600
"its-- the derivative
exists at x_0, then",00:45:35.600,00:45:45.560
f is continuous at x_0.,00:45:45.560,00:45:59.245
"So, we're gonna need
this is as a tool,",00:45:59.245,00:46:00.870
"it's a key step in the
product and quotient rules.",00:46:00.870,00:46:05.750
"So I'd like to prove
it right now for you.",00:46:05.750,00:46:12.380
So here is the proof.,00:46:12.380,00:46:16.270
"Fortunately the proof
is just one line.",00:46:16.270,00:46:20.430
"So first of all, I want to
write in just the right way what",00:46:20.430,00:46:24.740
it is that we have to check.,00:46:24.740,00:46:27.410
"So what we have to check is that
the limit, as x goes to x_0,",00:46:27.410,00:46:33.540
of f(x) - f(x_0) is equal to 0.,00:46:33.540,00:46:41.347
So this is what we want to know.,00:46:41.347,00:46:42.680
"We don't know it
yet, but we're trying",00:46:42.680,00:46:44.930
"to check whether
this is true or not.",00:46:44.930,00:46:47.650
"So that's the same
as the statement",00:46:47.650,00:46:49.790
"that the function is continuous
because the limit of f(x)",00:46:49.790,00:46:52.180
"is supposed to be f(x_0) and
so this difference should",00:46:52.180,00:46:56.300
have limit 0.,00:46:56.300,00:46:59.690
"And now, the way this
is proved is just",00:46:59.690,00:47:02.730
"by rewriting it by multiplying
and dividing by (x - x_0).",00:47:02.730,00:47:09.720
"So I'll rewrite the limit
as x goes to x_0 of f(x) -",00:47:09.720,00:47:17.381
"f(x_0) divided by x
- x_0 times x - x_0.",00:47:17.381,00:47:25.570
"Okay, so I wrote down the same
expression that I had here.",00:47:25.570,00:47:29.230
"This is just the same limit,
but I multiplied and divided",00:47:29.230,00:47:32.080
by (x - x_0).,00:47:32.080,00:47:38.070
"And now when I take the limit
what happens is the limit",00:47:38.070,00:47:45.150
of the first factor is f'(x_0).,00:47:45.150,00:47:48.830
"That's the thing we know
exists by our assumption.",00:47:48.830,00:47:53.940
"And the limit of the second
factor is 0 because the limit",00:47:53.940,00:48:00.640
"as x goes to x_0 of (x
- x_0) is clearly 0 .",00:48:00.640,00:48:06.700
So that's it.,00:48:06.700,00:48:09.210
"The answer is 0, which
is what we wanted.",00:48:09.210,00:48:12.210
So that's the proof.,00:48:12.210,00:48:14.980
"Now there's something
exceedingly fishy-looking",00:48:14.980,00:48:19.500
"about this proof and let me just
point to it before we proceed.",00:48:19.500,00:48:26.370
"Namely, you're used in limits
to setting x equal to 0.",00:48:26.370,00:48:33.050
"And this looks like we're
multiplying, dividing by 0,",00:48:33.050,00:48:35.880
"exactly the thing
which makes all proofs",00:48:35.880,00:48:38.430
"wrong in all kinds of
algebraic situations",00:48:38.430,00:48:42.562
and so on and so forth.,00:48:42.562,00:48:43.520
"You've been taught
that that never works.",00:48:43.520,00:48:45.780
Right?,00:48:45.780,00:48:47.750
"But somehow these
limiting tricks",00:48:47.750,00:48:51.040
"have found a way around
this and let me just",00:48:51.040,00:48:54.100
make explicit what it is.,00:48:54.100,00:48:55.880
"In this limit we never
are using x = x_0.",00:48:55.880,00:49:03.500
"That's exactly the
one value of x that we",00:49:03.500,00:49:05.720
don't consider in this limit.,00:49:05.720,00:49:09.120
That's how limits are cooked up.,00:49:09.120,00:49:11.910
"And that's sort of been
the themes so far today,",00:49:11.910,00:49:14.840
"is that we don't
have to consider that",00:49:14.840,00:49:17.100
"and so this multiplication
and division by this number",00:49:17.100,00:49:19.990
is legal.,00:49:19.990,00:49:21.450
"It may be small, this number,
but it's always non-zero.",00:49:21.450,00:49:25.200
"So this really works,
and it's really true,",00:49:25.200,00:49:27.670
"and we just checked that a
differentiable function is",00:49:27.670,00:49:31.040
continuous.,00:49:31.040,00:49:32.560
"So I'm gonna have to carry
out these limits, which",00:49:32.560,00:49:38.580
"are very interesting 0
/ 0 limits next time.",00:49:38.580,00:49:42.040
"But let's hang on for one second
to see if there any questions",00:49:42.040,00:49:46.512
before we stop.,00:49:46.512,00:49:47.907
"Yeah, there is a question.",00:49:47.907,00:49:48.990
"Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor:
Repeat this proof right here?",00:49:48.990,00:50:00.970
Just say again.,00:50:00.970,00:50:02.830
Student: [INAUDIBLE],00:50:02.830,00:50:08.230
"Professor: Okay, so there
are two steps to the proof",00:50:08.230,00:50:13.060
"and the step that you're
asking about is the first step.",00:50:13.060,00:50:17.870
Right?,00:50:17.870,00:50:18.580
"And what I'm saying is
if you have a number,",00:50:18.580,00:50:20.890
"and you multiply it by 10
/ 10 it's the same number.",00:50:20.890,00:50:24.640
"If you multiply it by 3
/ 3 it's the same number.",00:50:24.640,00:50:26.920
"2 / 2, 1 / 1, and so on.",00:50:26.920,00:50:30.110
"So it is okay to
change this to this,",00:50:30.110,00:50:32.385
it's exactly the same thing.,00:50:32.385,00:50:34.400
That's the first step.,00:50:34.400,00:50:36.220
Yes?,00:50:36.220,00:50:36.720
Student: [INAUDIBLE],00:50:36.720,00:50:41.560
Professor: Shhhh...,00:50:41.560,00:50:45.010
"The question was how does the
proof, how does this line,",00:50:45.010,00:50:52.100
yeah where the question mark is.,00:50:52.100,00:50:53.960
"So what I checked was
that this number which",00:50:53.960,00:50:55.910
"is on the left hand side
is equal to this very long",00:50:55.910,00:50:59.850
"complicated number which is
equal to this number which",00:50:59.850,00:51:04.800
is equal to this number.,00:51:04.800,00:51:06.270
"And so I've checked that
this number is equal to 0",00:51:06.270,00:51:08.600
because the last thing is 0.,00:51:08.600,00:51:12.120
"This is equal to that is
equal to that is equal to 0.",00:51:12.120,00:51:16.120
And that's the proof.,00:51:16.120,00:51:17.420
Yes?,00:51:17.420,00:51:17.920
Student: [INAUDIBLE],00:51:17.920,00:51:21.910
"Professor: So that's
a different question.",00:51:21.910,00:51:30.580
"Okay, so the hypothesis
of differentiability I",00:51:30.580,00:51:35.750
"use because this limit
is equal to this number.",00:51:35.750,00:51:39.420
That that limit exits.,00:51:39.420,00:51:40.520
"That's how I use the
hypothesis of the theorem.",00:51:40.520,00:51:44.170
"The conclusion of the
theorem is the same",00:51:44.170,00:51:46.560
"as this because being
continuous is the same as limit",00:51:46.560,00:51:51.300
"as x goes to x_0 of
f(x) is equal to f(x_0).",00:51:51.300,00:51:56.020
"That's the definition
of continuity.",00:51:56.020,00:51:57.530
"And I subtracted
f(x_0) from both sides",00:51:57.530,00:52:00.990
"to get this as being
the same thing.",00:52:00.990,00:52:02.860
"So this claim is continuity and
it's the same as this question",00:52:02.860,00:52:08.100
here.,00:52:08.100,00:52:10.350
Last question.,00:52:10.350,00:52:11.180
"Student: How did you
get the 0 [INAUDIBLE]",00:52:11.180,00:52:16.771
"Professor: How did we
get the 0 from this?",00:52:16.771,00:52:18.520
"So the claim that is
being made, so the claim",00:52:18.520,00:52:20.450
is why is this tending to that.,00:52:20.450,00:52:24.670
"So for example, I'm going
to have to erase something",00:52:24.670,00:52:27.410
to explain that.,00:52:27.410,00:52:28.730
"So the claim is that the limit
as x goes to x_0 of x - x_0",00:52:28.730,00:52:33.900
is equal to 0.,00:52:33.900,00:52:35.240
That's what I'm claiming.,00:52:35.240,00:52:37.160
"Okay, does that
answer your question?",00:52:37.160,00:52:39.490
Okay.,00:52:39.490,00:52:40.990
All right.,00:52:40.990,00:52:42.420
"Ask me other stuff
after lecture.",00:52:42.420,00:52:45.320
