"As promised, we will now start
developing generalizations of",00:00:00.680,00:00:04.310
"the different calculations that
we carried out in the",00:00:04.310,00:00:06.840
context of the radar example.,00:00:06.840,00:00:09.000
"The first kind of calculation
that we carried out goes under",00:00:09.000,00:00:11.920
"the name of the multiplication
rule.",00:00:11.920,00:00:14.380
And it goes as follows.,00:00:14.380,00:00:16.129
"Our starting point is the
definition of conditional",00:00:16.129,00:00:18.650
probabilities.,00:00:18.650,00:00:19.950
"The conditional probability of
A given another event, B, is",00:00:19.950,00:00:23.470
"the probability that both events
have occurred divided",00:00:23.470,00:00:26.720
"by the probability of the
conditioning event.",00:00:26.720,00:00:29.590
"We now take the denominator term
and send it to the other",00:00:29.590,00:00:32.940
"side of this equality to obtain
this relation, which we",00:00:32.940,00:00:36.850
can interpret as follows.,00:00:36.850,00:00:38.650
"The probability that two events
occur is equal to the",00:00:38.650,00:00:42.760
"probability that a first event
occurs, event B in this case,",00:00:42.760,00:00:47.450
"times the conditional
probability that the second",00:00:47.450,00:00:49.940
"event, event A, occurs, given
that event B has occurred.",00:00:49.940,00:00:55.360
"Now, out of the two events, A
and B, we're of course free to",00:00:55.360,00:00:59.310
"choose which one we call the
first event and which one we",00:00:59.310,00:01:02.320
call the second event.,00:01:02.320,00:01:03.810
"So the probability of the two
events happening is also equal",00:01:03.810,00:01:08.100
"to an expression of this form,
the probability that A occurs",00:01:08.100,00:01:11.840
"times the conditional
probability that B occurs,",00:01:11.840,00:01:14.380
given that A has occurred.,00:01:14.380,00:01:17.600
"We used this formula in the
context of a tree diagram.",00:01:17.600,00:01:21.789
"And we used it to calculate the
probability of a leaf of",00:01:21.789,00:01:26.000
"this tree by multiplying the
probability of taking this",00:01:26.000,00:01:30.480
"branch, the probability that A
occurs, times the conditional",00:01:30.480,00:01:34.820
"probability of taking this
branch, the probability that",00:01:34.820,00:01:38.400
"event B also occurs given that
event A has occurred.",00:01:38.400,00:01:44.180
"How do we generalize
this calculation?",00:01:44.180,00:01:46.810
"Consider a situation in which
the experiment has an",00:01:46.810,00:01:49.570
"additional third stage that has
to do with another event,",00:01:49.570,00:01:53.680
"C, that may or may not occur.",00:01:53.680,00:01:57.400
"For example, if we have arrived
here, A and B have",00:01:57.400,00:02:01.020
both occurred.,00:02:01.020,00:02:02.110
"And then C also occurs, then we
reach this particular leaf",00:02:02.110,00:02:07.080
of the tree.,00:02:07.080,00:02:08.199
"Or there could be
other scenarios.",00:02:08.199,00:02:10.220
"For example, it could be the
case that A did not occur.",00:02:10.220,00:02:14.910
"Then event B occurred, and
finally, event C did not",00:02:14.910,00:02:20.510
"occur, in which case we end up
at this particular leaf.",00:02:20.510,00:02:24.880
"What is the probability of
this scenario happening?",00:02:24.880,00:02:29.370
"Let us try to do a calculation
similar to the one that we",00:02:29.370,00:02:32.590
"used for the case
of two events.",00:02:32.590,00:02:35.990
"However, we need to deal
here with three events.",00:02:35.990,00:02:40.220
What should we do?,00:02:40.220,00:02:42.010
"Well, we look at the
intersection of these three",00:02:42.010,00:02:44.400
"events and think of it as the
intersection of a composite",00:02:44.400,00:02:48.890
"event, A complement intersection
B, then",00:02:48.890,00:02:53.390
"intersected with the
event C complement.",00:02:53.390,00:02:58.230
"Clearly, you can form the
intersection of three events",00:02:58.230,00:03:01.280
"by first taking the intersection
of two of them",00:03:01.280,00:03:04.370
"and then intersecting
with a third.",00:03:04.370,00:03:06.900
"After we group things this way,
we're dealing with the",00:03:06.900,00:03:09.420
"probability of two events
happening, this composite",00:03:09.420,00:03:13.140
event and this ordinary event.,00:03:13.140,00:03:15.730
"And the probability of two
events happening is equal to",00:03:15.730,00:03:20.230
"the probability that the first
event happens, and then the",00:03:20.230,00:03:27.630
"probability that the second
event happens, given that the",00:03:27.630,00:03:32.070
first one has happened.,00:03:32.070,00:03:33.665
"Can we simplify this
even further?",00:03:37.750,00:03:40.310
Yes.,00:03:40.310,00:03:40.900
"The first term is
the probability",00:03:40.900,00:03:42.780
of two events happening.,00:03:42.780,00:03:44.400
"So it can be simplified further
as the probability",00:03:44.400,00:03:48.130
"that A complement occurs times
the conditional probability",00:03:48.130,00:03:52.740
"that B occurs, given that A
complement has occurred.",00:03:52.740,00:03:57.310
"And then we carry over
the last term",00:03:57.310,00:03:59.810
exactly the way it is.,00:03:59.810,00:04:01.660
"The conclusion is that we can
calculate the probability of",00:04:06.230,00:04:09.400
"this leaf by multiplying the
probability of the first",00:04:09.400,00:04:13.190
"branch times the conditional
probability of the second",00:04:13.190,00:04:17.649
"branch, given that the first
branch was taken, and then",00:04:17.649,00:04:24.070
"finally multiply with the
probability of the third",00:04:24.070,00:04:28.710
"branch, which is the probability
that C complement",00:04:28.710,00:04:31.480
"occurs, given that A
complement and B",00:04:31.480,00:04:35.110
have already occurred.,00:04:35.110,00:04:38.250
"In other words, we can calculate
the probability of a",00:04:38.250,00:04:41.192
"leaf by just multiplying the
probabilities of the different",00:04:41.192,00:04:45.800
"branches involved and where we
use conditional probabilities",00:04:45.800,00:04:49.909
for the intermediate branches.,00:04:49.909,00:04:51.970
"At this point, you can use your
imagination to see that",00:04:51.970,00:04:55.490
"such a formula should also be
valid for the case of more",00:04:55.490,00:04:58.950
than three events.,00:04:58.950,00:05:00.610
"The probability that a bunch of
events all occur should be",00:05:00.610,00:05:04.950
"the probability of the first
event times a number of",00:05:04.950,00:05:09.180
"factors, each corresponding
to a branch in a",00:05:09.180,00:05:12.390
tree of this kind.,00:05:12.390,00:05:14.500
"In particular, the probability
that events A1, A2, up to An",00:05:14.500,00:05:25.220
"all occur is going to be the
probability that the first",00:05:25.220,00:05:30.520
"event occurs times a product of
conditional probabilities",00:05:30.520,00:05:37.880
"that the i-th event occurs,
given that all of the previous",00:05:37.880,00:05:43.380
events have already occurred.,00:05:43.380,00:05:46.165
"And we obtain a term of this
kind for every event, Ai,",00:05:50.710,00:05:54.980
"after the first one, so this
product ranges from 2 up to n.",00:05:54.980,00:06:02.860
"And this is the most general
version of the multiplication",00:06:02.860,00:06:05.730
"rule and allows you to calculate
the probability of",00:06:05.730,00:06:08.970
"several events happening by
multiplying probabilities and",00:06:08.970,00:06:13.590
conditional probabilities.,00:06:13.590,00:06:14.840
