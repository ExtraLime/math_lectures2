"Good morning, everyone.",00:00:22.430,00:00:23.672
And let's get started.,00:00:23.672,00:00:26.060
"Today's lecture is about a
randomized data structure",00:00:26.060,00:00:30.130
called the skip list.,00:00:30.130,00:00:32.200
"And it's a data structure
that, obviously because it's",00:00:32.200,00:00:37.390
"randomized, we'd have to do
a probabilistic analysis for.",00:00:37.390,00:00:41.360
"And we're going to sort of raise
the stakes here a little bit",00:00:41.360,00:00:44.740
"with respect to
our expectation--",00:00:44.740,00:00:48.010
"the pun intended of this
data structure-- in the sense",00:00:48.010,00:00:52.640
"that we're not going to be happy
with just doing an expected",00:00:52.640,00:00:57.410
"value analysis or to get
what the expectation is",00:00:57.410,00:01:01.290
"of the search complexity
in a skip list.",00:01:01.290,00:01:05.129
"We're going to introduce this
notion with high probability,",00:01:05.129,00:01:10.030
"which is a stronger notion than
just giving you the expected",00:01:10.030,00:01:13.630
"value or the expectation for
the complexity of a search",00:01:13.630,00:01:19.020
algorithm.,00:01:19.020,00:01:20.090
"And we're going to prove
that under this notion,",00:01:20.090,00:01:24.690
"that search has a
particular complexity",00:01:24.690,00:01:28.500
with high probability.,00:01:28.500,00:01:30.520
"So we'll get to the with high
probability part a little bit",00:01:30.520,00:01:34.480
"later in the lecture,
but we're just",00:01:34.480,00:01:36.330
"going to start off doing some
cool data structure design,",00:01:36.330,00:01:41.470
"I guess, [INAUDIBLE]
pointing to the skip list.",00:01:41.470,00:01:45.210
"The skip list is a relatively
young data structure",00:01:45.210,00:01:48.810
"invented by a guy called
Bill Pugh in 1989,",00:01:48.810,00:01:54.290
so not much older than you guys.,00:01:54.290,00:01:56.597
"It's relatively easy to
implement as you'll see.",00:01:59.470,00:02:04.240
"I won't really claim
that, but hopefully you'll",00:02:04.240,00:02:07.480
"be convinced by the time you're
done describing the structure.",00:02:07.480,00:02:11.700
"Especially in comparison
to balanced trees.",00:02:11.700,00:02:18.004
"And we can do a comparison after
we do our analysis of the data",00:02:20.670,00:02:24.860
"structure as to what the
complexity comparisons are",00:02:24.860,00:02:30.290
"for search and insert
when you take a skip list",00:02:30.290,00:02:33.920
"and compare it to an
AVL tree, for example,",00:02:33.920,00:02:37.310
"or a red black tree, et cetera.",00:02:37.310,00:02:41.820
"In general, when we
have a data structure,",00:02:41.820,00:02:44.240
we want it to be dynamic.,00:02:44.240,00:02:46.840
"The skip list maintains
a dynamic set.",00:02:46.840,00:02:53.530
"What that means
is not only do you",00:02:53.530,00:02:55.970
"want to search on
it-- obviously it's",00:02:55.970,00:02:58.810
"uninteresting to have a static
data structure and do a search.",00:02:58.810,00:03:03.170
"You want to be able to
change it, want to be",00:03:03.170,00:03:05.750
able to insert values into it.,00:03:05.750,00:03:08.390
"There's a complexity of
insert to worry about.",00:03:08.390,00:03:10.600
"You want to be able
to delete values.",00:03:10.600,00:03:13.170
"And the richness of
the data structure",00:03:13.170,00:03:15.110
"comes from the operations
and the augmentations",00:03:15.110,00:03:17.800
"you can do on it, and the skip
lists are no exception to that.",00:03:17.800,00:03:22.440
"So if you want to maintain
a dynamic set of n elements,",00:03:22.440,00:03:25.870
"and you obviously know a ton
of data structures to do this,",00:03:25.870,00:03:29.320
"each of which has
different characteristics.",00:03:29.320,00:03:32.630
"And this is, if you
ignore hash tables,",00:03:32.630,00:03:37.050
"this is your first real
randomized data structure,",00:03:37.050,00:03:44.280
"if you're just taking
6006 and this class",00:03:44.280,00:03:48.740
"might have seen randomized
structures in other classes.",00:03:48.740,00:03:51.875
"So we're going to try and
do this in order log n time.",00:03:55.050,00:04:00.320
"As you know with
balanced binary trees,",00:04:00.320,00:04:04.190
"you can do things in order
log n time, a ton of things,",00:04:04.190,00:04:07.470
"pretty much everything
that is interesting.",00:04:07.470,00:04:12.070
"And this, given that
it's randomized,",00:04:12.070,00:04:16.010
"it's a relatively
easy analysis to show",00:04:16.010,00:04:19.360
"that the expectation or the
expected value of a search",00:04:19.360,00:04:25.210
"would be order log
n expected time.",00:04:25.210,00:04:28.750
"But we're going to, as I
said, raise the stakes,",00:04:28.750,00:04:31.550
"and we're going to
spend a ton of time",00:04:31.550,00:04:36.020
"the second half of this showing
the with high probability",00:04:36.020,00:04:40.610
"result. And that's
a stronger result",00:04:40.610,00:04:43.850
"than just saying that search
takes expected order log n",00:04:43.850,00:04:47.790
time.,00:04:47.790,00:04:49.120
"All right, so
that's the context.",00:04:49.120,00:04:51.720
"You can think of a
skip list as beginning",00:04:51.720,00:04:55.720
with a simple linked list.,00:04:55.720,00:05:00.800
"So if we have one link list
and that link list-- let's",00:05:00.800,00:05:08.640
"first think of this
as being unsorted.",00:05:08.640,00:05:16.610
"So suppose I have a link
list which is unsorted",00:05:16.610,00:05:19.660
"and I want to search for a
particular value in this link",00:05:19.660,00:05:23.650
list.,00:05:23.650,00:05:24.380
"And we can assume that this
is a doubly-linked list,",00:05:24.380,00:05:29.320
so the arrows go both ways.,00:05:29.320,00:05:32.640
"You have a pointer, let's say,
just to the first element.",00:05:32.640,00:05:38.660
"So if you have a
list that's unsorted",00:05:38.660,00:05:41.920
"and you want to
search for an element,",00:05:41.920,00:05:45.030
"you would want to do
a membership query.",00:05:45.030,00:05:47.270
"If there's n elements,
the complexity is?",00:05:47.270,00:05:50.906
AUDIENCE: Order n.,00:05:50.906,00:05:51.860
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Order n.,00:05:51.860,00:05:53.140
"So a linked list, the search
takes the order n time.",00:05:53.140,00:06:00.370
"Now let's go ahead and say
that we are sorting this list,",00:06:00.370,00:06:05.630
so it's a sorted linked list.,00:06:05.630,00:06:07.930
"So your values here,
14, 23, 34, 42, 50, 59.",00:06:07.930,00:06:17.190
"They're sorted in
ascending order.",00:06:17.190,00:06:20.850
"You still only have a pointer
to the front of the list",00:06:20.850,00:06:25.040
"and it's a
doubly-linked list, what",00:06:25.040,00:06:27.710
"is the complexity of search
in the sorted link list?",00:06:27.710,00:06:34.090
AUDIENCE: Log n.,00:06:34.090,00:06:35.570
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Log n.,00:06:35.570,00:06:36.810
"Oh, I wanted to hear that.",00:06:36.810,00:06:39.200
Because it is?,00:06:39.200,00:06:40.724
AUDIENCE: Order n.,00:06:40.724,00:06:41.474
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: It's order n.,00:06:41.474,00:06:42.520
"log n is-- yeah, that
was a trick question.",00:06:42.520,00:06:44.400
"Because I liked that answer,
the person who said log n",00:06:49.310,00:06:51.910
gets a Frisbee.,00:06:51.910,00:06:52.550
This person won't admit.,00:06:55.790,00:06:56.800
[LAUGHTER],00:06:56.800,00:06:58.270
"Oh, it was you.",00:06:58.270,00:06:59.210
"OK, all right.",00:06:59.210,00:07:00.190
There you go.,00:07:00.190,00:07:02.200
All right.,00:07:02.200,00:07:03.940
"So log n would imply that
you have random access.",00:07:03.940,00:07:12.960
"If you have an array that's
sorted and you can go",00:07:12.960,00:07:16.090
"[? AFi, ?] and you can go
[? AFi ?] divided by 2,",00:07:16.090,00:07:19.660
"or [? AF2i ?] and you can
go directly to that element,",00:07:19.660,00:07:23.150
"then you can do binary search
and you can get a log n,",00:07:23.150,00:07:27.650
order log in.,00:07:27.650,00:07:29.010
"But here, the sorting
actually doesn't help you",00:07:29.010,00:07:33.210
"with respect to the
search simply because you",00:07:33.210,00:07:38.200
"have to start from
the beginning,",00:07:38.200,00:07:40.890
"from the front of the list,
and you've got to keep walking.",00:07:40.890,00:07:43.430
"The only place that it helps you
is that if you know it's sorted",00:07:43.430,00:07:47.390
"and you're looking
for 37, you can",00:07:47.390,00:07:50.850
"stop after you see 42, right?",00:07:50.850,00:07:54.840
"That's pretty much the only
place that it helps you.",00:07:54.840,00:07:57.030
"But it's still
order n because that",00:07:57.030,00:07:58.740
"could happen-- on
average is going",00:07:58.740,00:08:00.650
"to happen halfway through the
list for a given membership",00:08:00.650,00:08:04.410
query.,00:08:04.410,00:08:05.230
"So it's still order n
for a sorted link list.",00:08:05.230,00:08:10.350
"But now let's say that we
had two sorted link lists.",00:08:10.350,00:08:15.110
"And how are these two
link lists structured?",00:08:20.480,00:08:24.710
"Well, they're structured
in a certain way,",00:08:24.710,00:08:27.080
"and let me draw our canonical
example for skip list",00:08:27.080,00:08:32.270
"that I'm going to
keep coming back to.",00:08:32.270,00:08:34.090
"So I won't erase this, but I'll
draw one out-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,",00:08:34.090,00:08:39.974
"6, 7, 8, 9-- 9 elements.",00:08:39.974,00:08:42.605
"So that's my first
list which is sorted,",00:08:56.060,00:09:01.450
"and so I have 14, 23, 34,
42, 50, 59, 66, 72, and 79.",00:09:01.450,00:09:18.110
"What I'm going to have
now is another list sort",00:09:18.110,00:09:20.590
of on top of this.,00:09:20.590,00:09:22.830
"I can move from top
to bottom, et cetera.",00:09:22.830,00:09:31.660
"But I'm not going
to have elements",00:09:31.660,00:09:36.230
on top of each bottom element.,00:09:36.230,00:09:38.733
"By convention, I'm
going to have elements",00:09:42.090,00:09:44.650
"on top of the first
element, regardless",00:09:44.650,00:09:47.490
of how many lists I have.,00:09:47.490,00:09:48.870
We only have two at this point.,00:09:48.870,00:09:50.840
"And so I see a 14, which
is exactly the same element",00:09:50.840,00:09:54.100
duplicated up on the top list.,00:09:54.100,00:09:57.280
"And that list is
also sorted, but I",00:09:57.280,00:09:59.970
"won't have all of the
elements in the top list.",00:09:59.970,00:10:04.340
I'm just picking a couple here.,00:10:04.340,00:10:06.860
"So I've got 34, 42--
they're adjacent here--",00:10:06.860,00:10:11.770
"and then I go all
the way up to 72,",00:10:11.770,00:10:16.070
"and I duplicate it, et cetera.",00:10:16.070,00:10:18.740
"Now, this looks kind of random.",00:10:22.100,00:10:24.227
Anybody recognize these numbers?,00:10:24.227,00:10:25.560
"No one from the great
City of New York?",00:10:31.460,00:10:36.180
No?,00:10:36.180,00:10:36.760
"Yup, yup.",00:10:36.760,00:10:37.290
AUDIENCE: On the subway stops?,00:10:37.290,00:10:38.540
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yeah, subway
stops on the Seventh Avenue",00:10:38.540,00:10:41.520
Express Line.,00:10:41.520,00:10:42.465
"So this is exactly the notion
of a skip list, the fact",00:10:49.640,00:10:53.910
"that you have--
could you stand up?",00:10:53.910,00:10:57.152
Great.,00:10:59.992,00:11:02.970
All right.,00:11:02.970,00:11:04.520
"So the notion here
is that you don't",00:11:04.520,00:11:09.210
"have to make a lot of stops if
you know you have to go far.",00:11:09.210,00:11:14.370
"So if you want to go from
14th Street to 72nd Street,",00:11:14.370,00:11:20.340
you just take the express line.,00:11:20.340,00:11:22.960
"But if you want to go to 66th
Street, what would you do?",00:11:22.960,00:11:27.426
"AUDIENCE: Go to 72nd
and then go back.",00:11:27.426,00:11:30.830
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
Well, that's one way.",00:11:30.830,00:11:33.710
That's one way.,00:11:33.710,00:11:34.790
That's not the way I wanted.,00:11:34.790,00:11:37.156
"The way we're going
to do this is we're",00:11:37.156,00:11:38.780
not going to overshoot.,00:11:38.780,00:11:40.340
"So we want to minimize
distance, let's say.",00:11:40.340,00:11:43.360
"So our secondary
thing is going to be",00:11:43.360,00:11:46.240
minimizing distance travel.,00:11:46.240,00:11:49.730
"And so you're going to pop
up the express line, go",00:11:49.730,00:11:53.610
"all the way to 42nd
Street, and you're",00:11:53.610,00:11:58.400
"going to say if I go to the
next stop on the Express Line,",00:11:58.400,00:12:01.100
I'm going too far.,00:12:01.100,00:12:02.610
"And so you're going to pop
down to the local line.",00:12:02.610,00:12:05.630
"So you can think of this as
being link list L0 and link",00:12:05.630,00:12:09.240
list L1.,00:12:09.240,00:12:10.482
"You're going to pop
down, and then you're",00:12:10.482,00:12:12.190
going to go to 66th Street.,00:12:12.190,00:12:15.150
"So search 66 will be
going from 14 to 42",00:12:15.150,00:12:25.520
"on L1, and then from 42,
let's just say that's walking.",00:12:25.520,00:12:34.730
"42 to 42, L1 to L0.",00:12:34.730,00:12:37.690
And then 42 to 66 on L0.,00:12:43.510,00:12:47.310
"So that's the basic
notion of a skip list.",00:12:50.360,00:12:53.200
"So you can see that it's
really pretty simple.",00:12:53.200,00:12:57.660
"What we're going to do
now is do two things.",00:12:57.660,00:13:02.900
"I want to think about this
double-sorted list as a data",00:13:02.900,00:13:08.090
"structure in its own right
before I dive into skip lists",00:13:08.090,00:13:12.590
in general.,00:13:12.590,00:13:13.920
"And I want to analyze at some
level, the best case situation",00:13:13.920,00:13:21.990
for worst case complexity.,00:13:21.990,00:13:24.870
"And by that I mean I want to
structure the express stops",00:13:24.870,00:13:30.970
in the best manner possible.,00:13:30.970,00:13:33.490
"These stops are very
structured for passengers",00:13:33.490,00:13:35.660
"because they figured fancy
stops on 42nd Avenue, whatever--",00:13:35.660,00:13:38.980
fancy stores.,00:13:38.980,00:13:40.190
"Everybody wants to go there
and so on and so forth.",00:13:40.190,00:13:42.980
"So you have 34 pretty close
to 42 because they're both",00:13:42.980,00:13:46.890
popular destinations.,00:13:46.890,00:13:49.720
"But let's say that
things where I",00:13:49.720,00:13:53.250
"guess more egalitarian and
randomized, if you will.",00:13:53.250,00:13:57.920
"And what I want to do
is I want to structure",00:13:57.920,00:14:00.310
"this double-sorted list so
I get the best worst case",00:14:00.310,00:14:07.030
complexity for search.,00:14:07.030,00:14:10.330
And so let's do that.,00:14:10.330,00:14:12.750
"And before I do that, let me
write out the search algorithm,",00:14:12.750,00:14:20.019
which is going to be important.,00:14:20.019,00:14:21.310
"I want you to assimilate
this, keep it in your head",00:14:21.310,00:14:24.960
"because we're going
to analyze search",00:14:24.960,00:14:27.000
"pretty much for the rest
of the morning here.",00:14:27.000,00:14:29.250
And so I'll write this down.,00:14:29.250,00:14:31.930
"You've got a sense of what it
is based on what I just did here",00:14:31.930,00:14:37.280
"with this example of 66,
but worth writing down.",00:14:37.280,00:14:43.930
"We're going to walk right
in the top linked list,",00:14:43.930,00:14:47.060
"so this is simply
for two linked lists,",00:14:47.060,00:14:50.278
"and we'll generalize
at some point.",00:14:50.278,00:14:53.390
"So we want to walk right
in the top linked list, L1,",00:14:53.390,00:15:00.260
"until going right
would go too far.",00:15:00.260,00:15:06.956
"Now, there was this answer with
72, which I kind of dismissed.",00:15:11.060,00:15:15.210
"But there's no reason
why you can't overshoot",00:15:15.210,00:15:19.260
one stop and go backwards.,00:15:19.260,00:15:21.184
"It would just be a
different search algorithm.",00:15:21.184,00:15:23.100
"It's not something we're
going to analyze here.",00:15:23.100,00:15:25.380
"It turns out in analyzing that
with high probability would",00:15:25.380,00:15:29.770
"be even more painful
than the painful analysis",00:15:29.770,00:15:32.840
we're going to do.,00:15:32.840,00:15:34.290
So we won't go there.,00:15:34.290,00:15:35.355
"And then we walk down
to the bottom list.",00:15:39.690,00:15:45.880
"And the bottom
list we'll call L0.",00:15:52.350,00:15:54.940
"And walk right in L0 until
the element is found or not.",00:15:57.930,00:16:11.960
"And you know that
if you've overshot.",00:16:11.960,00:16:13.630
"So if you're looking here for
route 67, when you get to 72",00:16:16.220,00:16:21.130
"here-- you've seen
66 and you get to 72",00:16:21.130,00:16:24.540
"and you're looking
for 67, search fails.",00:16:24.540,00:16:27.450
It stops and fails.,00:16:27.450,00:16:28.730
Doesn't succeed in this case.,00:16:28.730,00:16:30.880
"So that's what we
got for search.",00:16:30.880,00:16:34.870
"And that's our two
linked list argument.",00:16:34.870,00:16:38.300
"Now, our analysis essentially
says what I have is",00:16:38.300,00:16:45.040
"I'm walking right at
the bottom list here,",00:16:45.040,00:16:53.090
"and my top list is L1,
so I start with L1.",00:16:53.090,00:16:59.530
"And my search cost
is going to be",00:17:02.845,00:17:04.780
approximately the length of L1.,00:17:04.780,00:17:12.420
"The worst case analysis,
I could go all the way",00:17:12.420,00:17:17.470
on the top list-- it's possible.,00:17:17.470,00:17:22.030
"But for a given value, I'm
going to be looking at only",00:17:22.030,00:17:30.680
a portion of the bottom list.,00:17:30.680,00:17:34.730
"I'm not going to go all the
way on the bottom list ever.",00:17:34.730,00:17:37.700
"I'm only going to be
looking at a portion of it.",00:17:37.700,00:17:40.250
"So it's going to be
L0 divided by L1,",00:17:40.250,00:17:44.220
"if I have interspersed my
express stops in a uniform way.",00:17:44.220,00:17:51.180
"So there's no reason--
if I have 100 elements",00:17:51.180,00:17:54.600
"in the bottom list,
and if I had five,",00:17:54.600,00:17:59.750
"just for argument sake,
five in the top list,",00:17:59.750,00:18:02.160
"then I'd put them at, let's
say, the 0 position, 20, 40, 60,",00:18:02.160,00:18:08.060
et cetera.,00:18:08.060,00:18:09.260
"So I want to have
roughly equal spacings.",00:18:09.260,00:18:11.540
"But we need to make that
a little more concrete,",00:18:11.540,00:18:15.505
and a little more precise.,00:18:15.505,00:18:17.600
"And what I'm saying
here simply is",00:18:17.600,00:18:19.210
"that this is the cost of
traversal in the top list,",00:18:19.210,00:18:23.300
"and this is the cost of
traversal in the bottom list,",00:18:23.300,00:18:26.022
"because I'm not going to go
all the way in the bottom list.",00:18:26.022,00:18:28.480
"I'm only going to go a
portion on the bottom list.",00:18:28.480,00:18:31.650
Everybody gets that?,00:18:31.650,00:18:33.152
Yup?,00:18:33.152,00:18:34.400
"All right, good.",00:18:34.400,00:18:35.830
"So if I want to minimize
this cost, which",00:18:35.830,00:18:38.860
"is going to tell
me how to scatter",00:18:38.860,00:18:44.250
"these elements in the top list,
how to choose my express stops,",00:18:44.250,00:18:50.230
"if you will-- I want to
scatter these in a uniform way,",00:18:50.230,00:18:54.560
"then this is minimized
when terms are equal.",00:18:54.560,00:19:01.908
"You could go off and
differentiate and do that.",00:19:04.920,00:19:07.510
It's fairly standard.,00:19:07.510,00:19:09.670
"And what you end up getting
is you want to get L1 square",00:19:09.670,00:19:16.950
equals L0 equals n.,00:19:16.950,00:19:20.510
"So all of the elements are
down at the bottom list,",00:19:20.510,00:19:23.460
"and so the cardinality
of the bottom list is n.",00:19:23.460,00:19:27.730
"And roughly speaking, you're
going to end up optimizing,",00:19:27.730,00:19:34.980
"if you have this satisfied,
which means that L1 is",00:19:34.980,00:19:39.950
going to be square root of n.,00:19:39.950,00:19:42.010
OK?,00:19:42.010,00:19:43.310
"So what you've done here is
you've said a bunch of things,",00:19:43.310,00:19:46.870
actually.,00:19:46.870,00:19:48.030
"You've decided how
many elements are",00:19:48.030,00:19:50.760
going to be in your top list.,00:19:50.760,00:19:53.580
"If there's n elements
in the bottom list,",00:19:53.580,00:19:55.450
"you want to have the square root
of n elements in the top list.",00:19:55.450,00:19:59.580
"And not only that,
in order to make sure",00:19:59.580,00:20:02.100
"that this works properly, and
that you don't get a worse case",00:20:02.100,00:20:07.910
"cost that is not
optimal, you do have",00:20:07.910,00:20:10.930
"to intersperse the
square root of n elements",00:20:10.930,00:20:15.340
"at regular intervals in
relation to the bottom list",00:20:15.340,00:20:19.630
on the top list.,00:20:19.630,00:20:21.020
"OK, so pictorially
what this means is it's",00:20:21.020,00:20:24.820
not what you have here.,00:20:24.820,00:20:26.730
"What you really
want is something",00:20:26.730,00:20:29.780
"that, let's say, looks like
this where this part here",00:20:29.780,00:20:40.920
"is square root of n elements
up until that point,",00:20:40.920,00:20:45.750
"and then let's say we
go from here to here",00:20:45.750,00:20:50.190
"or square root of n
elements, and maybe I'll",00:20:50.190,00:20:52.930
"have a 66 here because
that's exactly where I",00:20:52.930,00:20:57.610
want my square root of n.,00:20:57.610,00:20:59.180
"Basically, three
elements in between.",00:20:59.180,00:21:02.130
"So I got 66 here, et cetera.",00:21:02.130,00:21:06.870
"I mean I chose n to be
a particular value here,",00:21:06.870,00:21:09.310
but you get the picture.,00:21:09.310,00:21:12.230
"So the search now, as you can
see if you just add those up",00:21:12.230,00:21:15.210
"you get square root
of n here, and you",00:21:15.210,00:21:17.240
"got n divided by
square root of n here.",00:21:17.240,00:21:19.270
"So that's square
root of n as well.",00:21:19.270,00:21:21.060
"So the search cost is
order square root of n.",00:21:21.060,00:21:29.530
And so that's it.,00:21:29.530,00:21:30.766
"That's the first
generalization, and really",00:21:30.766,00:21:36.660
"the most important
one, that comes",00:21:36.660,00:21:39.900
"from going from a
single sorted list",00:21:39.900,00:21:42.580
"to an approximation
of a skip list.",00:21:42.580,00:21:47.370
"So what do you do if you
want to make things better?",00:21:47.370,00:21:51.420
"So we want to make
things better?",00:21:51.420,00:21:52.970
"Are we happy with
square root of n?",00:21:52.970,00:21:54.609
AUDIENCE: No.,00:21:54.609,00:21:55.150
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: No.,00:21:55.150,00:21:55.500
"Well, what's our target?",00:21:55.500,00:21:56.966

"SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
Log n, obviously.",00:21:57.760,00:21:59.370
"Well, I guess you can
argue that our target may",00:21:59.370,00:22:01.328
"be order 1 at some point,
but for today's lecture",00:22:01.328,00:22:03.880
"it is order log n
with high probability.",00:22:03.880,00:22:06.960
We'll leave it at that.,00:22:06.960,00:22:08.150
"And so what do you do if
you want to go this way",00:22:08.150,00:22:14.940
and generalize?,00:22:14.940,00:22:16.370
You simply add more lists.,00:22:16.370,00:22:18.525
"I mean it seems to be pretty
much the only thing we",00:22:18.525,00:22:20.650
could do here.,00:22:20.650,00:22:22.050
"So let's go ahead
and add a third list.",00:22:22.050,00:22:25.900
"So if you have two
sorted lists, that",00:22:25.900,00:22:32.710
"implies I have 2
square root of n.",00:22:32.710,00:22:34.560
"If I want to be explicit
about the constant in terms",00:22:34.560,00:22:37.240
"of the search cost,
assuming things",00:22:37.240,00:22:40.050
are interspersed exactly right.,00:22:40.050,00:22:42.900
"Keep that in mind because
that is going to go away",00:22:42.900,00:22:45.560
when we go and randomize.,00:22:45.560,00:22:47.000
"We're going to be flipping
coins and things like that.",00:22:47.000,00:22:50.220
"But so far, things
are very structured.",00:22:50.220,00:22:53.880
"What do you think-- we won't
do this analysis-- the cost is",00:22:53.880,00:22:59.690
"going to be if I
intersperse optimally, what",00:22:59.690,00:23:04.410
"is the cost going
to be for a search",00:23:04.410,00:23:08.830
when I have three sorted lists?,00:23:08.830,00:23:12.575
AUDIENCE: Cube root.,00:23:12.575,00:23:13.624
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Cube root.,00:23:13.624,00:23:14.790
Great guess.,00:23:14.790,00:23:15.540
Who said cube root?,00:23:15.540,00:23:16.930

I need to get rid of these.,00:23:20.780,00:23:21.905
"So it's going to be cube
root, and the constant",00:23:24.810,00:23:29.730

SRINIVAS DEVADAS: 3.,00:23:31.647,00:23:32.480
So you have-- right?,00:23:32.480,00:23:36.380
So let's just keep going.,00:23:36.380,00:23:37.910
You have k sorted lists.,00:23:37.910,00:23:39.860
"You're going to have k
times the k-th root of n.",00:23:39.860,00:23:43.550
That's what you got.,00:23:47.700,00:23:49.310
"And I'm not going to
bother drawing this,",00:23:49.310,00:23:51.070
"but essentially
what happens is you",00:23:51.070,00:23:53.160
"are making the same number
of moves which corresponds",00:23:53.160,00:23:57.110
"to the root of n, the
corresponding root of n,",00:23:57.110,00:24:01.180
at every level.,00:24:01.180,00:24:04.420
"And the last thing we have to do
to get a sense for what happens",00:24:04.420,00:24:12.600
"here is we have log n sorted
lists, so the number of levels",00:24:12.600,00:24:17.630
here is log n.,00:24:17.630,00:24:20.770
"So this is starting to look kind
of familiar because it borrows",00:24:20.770,00:24:24.840
from other data structures.,00:24:24.840,00:24:26.530
"And what this is I'm just going
to substitute log n for k,",00:24:26.530,00:24:31.390
"and I got this kind
of scary looking--",00:24:31.390,00:24:36.240
"I was scared the
first time I saw this.",00:24:36.240,00:24:38.037
"Oh, this is n.",00:24:41.306,00:24:42.150
"It's the log n-th root of n, OK?",00:24:45.050,00:24:49.494
"And so it's kind
of scary looking.",00:24:49.494,00:24:50.910
"But what is the log n-th
root of n-- and we can assume",00:24:50.910,00:24:53.840
that n is a power of two?,00:24:53.840,00:24:56.102
AUDIENCE: 2.,00:24:56.102,00:24:56.602
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: 2, exactly.",00:24:56.602,00:24:58.396
"It's not that scary
looking, and that's",00:24:58.396,00:25:00.020
because I'm not a mathematician.,00:25:00.020,00:25:01.630
That's why I was scared.,00:25:01.630,00:25:03.710
So 2 log n.,00:25:03.710,00:25:06.930
All right.,00:25:06.930,00:25:07.850
So that's it.,00:25:07.850,00:25:10.140

this works now, right?",00:25:10.140,00:25:14.170
"We haven't talked about
randomized structures yet,",00:25:14.170,00:25:16.730

the template that's",00:25:16.730,00:25:18.860

"going to have are-- if it was
static data items and n was",00:25:22.990,00:25:29.990
"a power of two, then
essentially what",00:25:29.990,00:25:32.500
"I'm saying is I'm going to
have a bunch of items, n items,",00:25:32.500,00:25:37.230
at the bottom.,00:25:37.230,00:25:38.620
"I'm going to have n over
2 items at the list that's",00:25:38.620,00:25:41.690
just immediately above.,00:25:41.690,00:25:44.280
"And each of them are
going to be alternating.",00:25:44.280,00:25:46.620
"You're going to have
an item in between.",00:25:46.620,00:25:48.570
"And then on the top I'm
going to see n over 4 items,",00:25:48.570,00:25:52.210
and so on and so forth.,00:25:52.210,00:25:53.940
What does that look like?,00:25:53.940,00:25:56.270
"Kind of looks like
a tree, right?",00:25:56.270,00:25:57.710
"I mean it doesn't
have the structure",00:25:57.710,00:25:59.210
"of a tree in the sense
of the edges of a tree.",00:25:59.210,00:26:02.072
"It's quite different
because you're",00:26:02.072,00:26:03.530
connecting things differently.,00:26:03.530,00:26:06.300
"You have all the
leaves connected down",00:26:06.300,00:26:07.970
"at the bottom of
this so-called tree",00:26:07.970,00:26:10.170
"with this doubly linked
list, but it has the triangle",00:26:10.170,00:26:13.890
structure of a tree.,00:26:13.890,00:26:15.140
"And that's where the
log n comes from.",00:26:15.140,00:26:17.490
"So this is would
all be wonderful",00:26:17.490,00:26:20.290
if this were a static set.,00:26:20.290,00:26:22.340
"And n doesn't have to be a
power of 2-- you could pad it,",00:26:22.340,00:26:25.910
and so on and so forth.,00:26:25.910,00:26:27.180
"But the big thing here
is that we haven't quite",00:26:27.180,00:26:29.400
"accomplished what
we set out to do,",00:26:29.400,00:26:32.900
"even though we seem to have
this log n cost for search.",00:26:32.900,00:26:37.220
"But it's all based on a static
set which doesn't change.",00:26:37.220,00:26:41.840
"And the problem, of course, is
that you could have deletions.",00:26:41.840,00:26:45.010
You want to take away 42.,00:26:45.010,00:26:47.480
"For some reason you
can't go to 42nd Avenue,",00:26:47.480,00:26:50.130
"or I guess art-- you
can't go to [INAUDIBLE]",00:26:50.130,00:26:53.090
would be a better example.,00:26:53.090,00:26:55.300
"So stuff breaks, right?",00:26:55.300,00:26:58.300
"And so you take stuff out
and you insert things in.",00:26:58.300,00:27:01.530
"Suppose I wanted to insert
60, 61, 62, 63, and 64",00:27:01.530,00:27:06.650
into that list that I have?,00:27:06.650,00:27:08.180
What would happen?,00:27:08.180,00:27:10.239
"Yeah, you're shaking your head.",00:27:10.239,00:27:11.530
"I mean that log n would go
away, so it would be a problem.",00:27:11.530,00:27:17.490
"But what we have
to do now is move",00:27:17.490,00:27:20.050
to the probabilistic domain.,00:27:20.050,00:27:22.320
"We have to think
about what happens",00:27:22.320,00:27:23.990
when we insert elements.,00:27:23.990,00:27:25.190
We need an algorithm for insert.,00:27:25.190,00:27:27.000
"So then we can start with the
null list and build it up.",00:27:27.000,00:27:30.510
"And then you start
with a null list",00:27:30.510,00:27:32.990
"and you have a randomized
algorithm for insert,",00:27:32.990,00:27:35.410
"it ain't going to
look that pretty.",00:27:35.410,00:27:37.490
It's going to look random.,00:27:37.490,00:27:39.990
"But you have to have a
certain amount of structure",00:27:39.990,00:27:42.460
"so you can still get
your order log n.",00:27:42.460,00:27:45.190
"So you have to do the
insertion appropriately.",00:27:45.190,00:27:48.630
"So that's what we
have to do next.",00:27:48.630,00:27:50.325
"But any questions
about that complexity",00:27:50.325,00:27:51.950
that I have up there?,00:27:51.950,00:27:52.832
"All right, good.",00:27:55.460,00:27:56.780
"I want a canonical
example of a list here,",00:28:03.280,00:28:08.460
"and I kind of ran out
of room over there,",00:28:08.460,00:28:10.400
"so bear with me as I draw you
a more sophisticated skip list",00:28:10.400,00:28:23.220
that has a few more levels.,00:28:23.220,00:28:25.900
"And the reason for this is
it's only interesting when",00:28:25.900,00:28:30.090
you have three or more levels.,00:28:30.090,00:28:33.100
"The search algorithm
is kind of the same.",00:28:33.100,00:28:35.330
"You go up top and when
you overshoot you pop down",00:28:35.330,00:28:39.070
"one level, and then you do
the same thing over and over.",00:28:39.070,00:28:43.670
"But we are going
to have to bound",00:28:43.670,00:28:48.060
"the number of levels in the skip
list in a probabilistic way.",00:28:48.060,00:28:52.740
"We have to actually discover
the expected number of levels",00:28:52.740,00:28:57.410
"because we're going to be doing
inserts in a randomized way.",00:28:57.410,00:29:01.540
"And so it's worthwhile
having a picture that's",00:29:01.540,00:29:04.380
"a little more interesting than
the picture of the two linked",00:29:04.380,00:29:07.750
lists that I had up there.,00:29:07.750,00:29:09.800
"So I'm going to leave this on
for the rest of the lecture.",00:29:09.800,00:29:14.685
"So that's our bottom,
and that hasn't changed",00:29:23.000,00:29:25.000
from our previous examples.,00:29:25.000,00:29:27.420
"I'm not going to bother drawing
the horizontal connections.",00:29:27.420,00:29:34.450
"When you see things adjacent
horizontally at the same level,",00:29:34.450,00:29:39.080
"assume that they're all
connected-- all of them.",00:29:39.080,00:29:43.896
And so I have four levels here.,00:29:46.950,00:29:52.440
"And you can think of this
as being the entire list",00:29:52.440,00:29:56.310
or part of it.,00:29:56.310,00:29:58.310
"Just to delineate
things nicely, we'll",00:29:58.310,00:30:02.685
"assume that 79, which
is the last element,",00:30:02.685,00:30:07.940
"is all the way up
at the top as well.",00:30:07.940,00:30:10.150
"Sort of the terminus,
termini, corresponding",00:30:10.150,00:30:15.300
to our analogy of subways.,00:30:15.300,00:30:21.980
"And so that's our
top-most level.",00:30:21.980,00:30:24.400
"And then I might have
50 here at this level,",00:30:24.400,00:30:35.470
or so that looks like.,00:30:35.470,00:30:36.720
"I will have 50, so
the invariant here,",00:30:36.720,00:30:39.320
"and that's another reason
I want to draw this out,",00:30:39.320,00:30:41.950
"is that if you have a station
at highest level, then",00:30:41.950,00:30:48.680
"you will have-- it's got
to be sitting on something.",00:30:48.680,00:30:54.000
"So if you've got a 79 at
level four, or level three",00:30:54.000,00:30:57.180
"here if this is L0, then you
will see 79 at L2, L1, and L0.",00:30:57.180,00:31:06.200
"And if you see 50 here,
it's not in L3 so that's OK,",00:31:06.200,00:31:09.900
"but it's in L2, so it's
got to be at L1 as well.",00:31:09.900,00:31:13.420
"Of course you know that
everything is down at L1,",00:31:13.420,00:31:15.660
"so this is interesting from a
standpoint of the relationship",00:31:15.660,00:31:18.800
"between Li and Li plus 1 where
i is greater than or equal to 1.",00:31:18.800,00:31:25.220
"So the implication is that if
you see it at at Li plus 1,",00:31:25.220,00:31:33.440
"it's going to be at
Li and Li minus 1",00:31:33.440,00:31:37.340
"if that happens to
exist, et cetera.",00:31:37.340,00:31:39.940
"And so one last thing
here just to finish it up.",00:31:39.940,00:31:42.980
"I got 34 here, which is
an additional thing which",00:31:42.980,00:31:48.490
ends there.,00:31:48.490,00:31:49.160
"So the highest level is
this second level or L1.",00:31:49.160,00:31:54.060
This is 66.,00:31:54.060,00:31:56.760
And then that's it.,00:31:56.760,00:31:58.850
So that's our skip list.,00:31:58.850,00:32:01.910
"So if you wanted to search
for 72, you would start here,",00:32:01.910,00:32:05.910
"and then you'd go to 79,
or you'd look and say,",00:32:05.910,00:32:09.460
"oh, 79 is too far, so I'm
going to pop down a level.",00:32:09.460,00:32:13.560
"And then you'd say 50, oh, good.",00:32:13.560,00:32:15.320
I can get to 50.,00:32:15.320,00:32:16.690
"79 is too far, so I'm
going to pop down a level.",00:32:16.690,00:32:19.520
"And then you go to 66--
79 is too far-- and at 66,",00:32:19.520,00:32:23.820
"you pop down a level and
then you go 66 to 72.",00:32:23.820,00:32:29.220
So same as what we had before.,00:32:29.220,00:32:31.120
"Hopefully it's not
too complicated.",00:32:31.120,00:32:34.310
So that's our skip list.,00:32:34.310,00:32:36.990
"It's still looking
pretty structured,",00:32:36.990,00:32:40.710
looking pretty regular.,00:32:40.710,00:32:43.000
"But if I start
taking that and start",00:32:43.000,00:32:44.640
"inserting things
and deleting things,",00:32:44.640,00:32:46.590
it could become quite irregular.,00:32:46.590,00:32:48.680
"I could take away
23, for example.",00:32:48.680,00:32:50.540
"And there's nothing
that's stopping me",00:32:50.540,00:32:52.123
from taking away 34 or 79.,00:32:52.123,00:32:54.446
"You've got to delete
an element, you've",00:32:54.446,00:32:56.070
got to delete an element.,00:32:56.070,00:32:57.574
"I mean the fact that
it's in four levels",00:32:57.574,00:32:59.240
shouldn't make a difference.,00:32:59.240,00:33:01.530
"And so that's something
to keep in mind.",00:33:01.530,00:33:03.680
So this could get pretty messy.,00:33:03.680,00:33:07.110
"So let's talk about
insert, and I've",00:33:07.110,00:33:08.830
"spent a bunch of time skirting
around the issue of what",00:33:08.830,00:33:12.190
"exactly happens when
you insert an element.",00:33:12.190,00:33:15.910
Turns out delete is pretty easy.,00:33:15.910,00:33:18.260
Insert is more interesting.,00:33:18.260,00:33:20.330
Let's do insert.,00:33:20.330,00:33:21.090
"To insert an element
x into a skip list,",00:33:43.540,00:33:45.855
"the first thing
we're going to do",00:33:45.855,00:33:47.230
"is search to figure out where
x fits into the bottom list.",00:33:47.230,00:33:59.530
"So you do a search just like
you would if you were just",00:33:59.530,00:34:04.270
doing a search.,00:34:04.270,00:34:06.990
"You always insert into
the appropriate position.",00:34:06.990,00:34:09.750
"So if there's a
single sorted list,",00:34:09.750,00:34:12.040
that would pretty much be it.,00:34:12.040,00:34:13.248
And so that part is easy.,00:34:16.400,00:34:18.810
"If you want to insert 67, you
do all of the search operations",00:34:18.810,00:34:24.530
"that I just went
over, and then you",00:34:24.530,00:34:26.270
insert 67 between 66 and 72.,00:34:26.270,00:34:30.639
"So do your pointer
manipulations, what have you,",00:34:30.639,00:34:33.949
and you're good.,00:34:33.949,00:34:35.250
"But you're not done yet, because
you want this to be a skip list",00:34:35.250,00:34:38.250
"and you want this to
have expected search",00:34:38.250,00:34:41.730
"over any random query as
the list grows and shrinks",00:34:41.730,00:34:47.199
"of order log n, expectation,
and also with high probability.",00:34:47.199,00:34:51.060
"So what you're going to have to
do is when you start inserting,",00:34:51.060,00:34:54.560
"you're going to have
to decide if you're",00:34:54.560,00:34:56.820
"going to what is called
promote these elements or not.",00:34:56.820,00:35:01.740
"And the notion of a
promotion is that you",00:35:01.740,00:35:05.240
"are going up and duplicating
this inserted element",00:35:05.240,00:35:09.500
some number of levels up.,00:35:09.500,00:35:11.820
"So if you just look
at how this works,",00:35:11.820,00:35:16.520
"it's really pretty
straightforward.",00:35:16.520,00:35:18.490
"What is going to happen is
simply that let's say I have 67",00:35:18.490,00:35:22.070
"and I'm going to insert
it between 66 and 72.",00:35:22.070,00:35:25.000
That much is a given.,00:35:25.000,00:35:26.230
That is deterministic.,00:35:26.230,00:35:28.020
"Then I'm going to flip a
coin or spin a Frisbee.",00:35:28.020,00:35:33.550
I like this better.,00:35:33.550,00:35:36.180
"I'm not sure if this
is biased or not.",00:35:36.180,00:35:38.420
It's probably seriously biased.,00:35:38.420,00:35:40.230
[LAUGHTER],00:35:40.230,00:35:42.880
"Would it ever go the
other way is the question.",00:35:42.880,00:35:47.650
Would it ever?,00:35:47.650,00:35:48.400
No.,00:35:48.400,00:35:49.560
All right.,00:35:49.560,00:35:50.120
So we've got a problem here.,00:35:50.120,00:35:51.860
"I think we might have to
do something like that.",00:35:51.860,00:35:53.920
[LAUGHTER],00:35:53.920,00:35:57.030
I'm procrastinating.,00:35:57.030,00:35:58.280
"I don't want to teach the
rest of this material.",00:35:58.280,00:36:00.280
[LAUGHTER],00:36:00.280,00:36:05.630
All right.,00:36:05.630,00:36:06.630
"Let's go, let's go.",00:36:06.630,00:36:08.840
"So I'd like to insert
into some of the lists,",00:36:08.840,00:36:23.640
"and the big question
is which ones?",00:36:23.640,00:36:25.420
It's going to be really cool.,00:36:30.060,00:36:32.370
"I'm just going to flip
coins, fair coins,",00:36:32.370,00:36:36.560
"and decide how much to
promote these elements.",00:36:36.560,00:36:42.855
So flip fair coin.,00:36:51.940,00:36:57.790
"If heads, promote x to the
next level up, and repeat.",00:36:57.790,00:37:13.000
"Else, if you ever get
a tails, you stop.",00:37:21.100,00:37:26.400
"And this next level up
may be newly created.",00:37:26.400,00:37:29.030
"So what might happen with the
67 is that you stick it in here,",00:37:35.370,00:37:41.530
"and it might happen that
the first time you flip you",00:37:41.530,00:37:44.520
"get a tails, in which
case, 67 is going",00:37:44.520,00:37:47.520
to just be at the bottom list.,00:37:47.520,00:37:49.270
"But if you get one heads,
then you're not only",00:37:49.270,00:37:51.760
"going to put 67 in
here, you're going",00:37:51.760,00:37:54.020
to put 67 up here as well.,00:37:54.020,00:37:55.880
And you're going to flip again.,00:37:55.880,00:37:59.160
"And if you get a heads again,
you're going to put 67 up here.",00:37:59.160,00:38:04.890
"And if you get a heads again,
you're going to put 67 up here.",00:38:04.890,00:38:10.040
"And if you get a
heads again, you're",00:38:10.040,00:38:11.650
"going to create a
new list up there,",00:38:11.650,00:38:13.790
"and at this point when
you create the new list,",00:38:13.790,00:38:17.265
"it's only going
to be 67 up there.",00:38:17.265,00:38:20.420
"And that's going to be
the front of your list,",00:38:20.420,00:38:24.330
"because that's the one element
that you're duplicating.",00:38:24.330,00:38:27.210
"So you're going to keep
going until you get a tails.",00:38:27.210,00:38:30.660
"Now, that's why this
coin had better be fair.",00:38:30.660,00:38:34.430
"So you're going to
keep going and you're",00:38:34.430,00:38:36.310
going to keep adding.,00:38:36.310,00:38:37.910
"Every time you insert
there's a potential",00:38:37.910,00:38:40.950
"for increasing the number
of levels in this list.",00:38:40.950,00:38:44.700
"Now, the number
of levels is going",00:38:44.700,00:38:47.810
"to be bounded in expectation
with a high probability",00:38:47.810,00:38:52.270
"of regular
expectation, but I want",00:38:52.270,00:38:55.220
"to make it clear that
every time you insert,",00:38:55.220,00:38:57.820
"if you get a chain
of heads, you're",00:38:57.820,00:38:59.690
going to be adding levels.,00:38:59.690,00:39:02.130
"And so the first time you
get a tails, you just stop.",00:39:02.130,00:39:06.550
You just stop.,00:39:06.550,00:39:08.090
"So you can see that this can
get pretty messy pretty quick.",00:39:08.090,00:39:11.730
"And especially if you were
starting from ground zero",00:39:11.730,00:39:14.180
"and adding 14, 23--
all of those things,",00:39:14.180,00:39:16.610
"the bottom is going
to look exactly",00:39:16.610,00:39:18.120
"like it looks now because
you're going to put it in there.",00:39:18.120,00:39:20.600
It's deterministic.,00:39:20.600,00:39:21.910
"But the very next level after
that looked pretty messy.",00:39:21.910,00:39:24.740
"You could have all of
them chunked up here,",00:39:24.740,00:39:26.560
"and a big gap, et
cetera, et cetera.",00:39:26.560,00:39:29.000
"So it's all about
randomized search cost.",00:39:29.000,00:39:33.600
"The worse case cost here
is going to be order n.",00:39:33.600,00:39:37.920
"Worst case cost is
going to be order n,",00:39:37.920,00:39:40.030
"because you have no idea
where these things are",00:39:40.030,00:39:42.310
going to end up.,00:39:42.310,00:39:43.330
"But the randomized cost
is what's cool about this.",00:39:43.330,00:39:47.020
"Any questions about
insert or anything I said?",00:39:47.020,00:39:50.940
"Yeah, go ahead.",00:39:50.940,00:39:51.887
"AUDIENCE: Is worse
case really order n?",00:39:51.887,00:39:53.512
"What if you had a really
long, like a lot of lists",00:39:53.512,00:39:55.640
"on top of each other, and
you start at the top of that",00:39:55.640,00:39:58.200
"and you had to walk all
the way [INAUDIBLE]?",00:39:58.200,00:40:01.530
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Well, you go
n down and n this way, right?",00:40:01.530,00:40:05.820
"You would be checking
so it would be order n.",00:40:05.820,00:40:08.589
"AUDIENCE: So it's
[? bounded ?] by n?",00:40:08.589,00:40:10.130
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
Yeah, the worst case.",00:40:10.130,00:40:11.980
"AUDIENCE: Worse
case is infinity.",00:40:11.980,00:40:13.790
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
Worse case is infinity.",00:40:13.790,00:40:14.840
"Oh, in that sense, yeah.",00:40:14.840,00:40:15.890
OK.,00:40:15.890,00:40:17.020
"Well, n elements, Eric is right.",00:40:17.020,00:40:19.769
"So what is happening
here is that you",00:40:19.769,00:40:21.310
"have a small probability
that you will",00:40:21.310,00:40:23.700
keep flipping heads forever.,00:40:23.700,00:40:27.840
"So at some level, if you
somehow take that away and use",00:40:27.840,00:40:32.140
"Frisbees instead
or you truncate it.",00:40:32.140,00:40:34.750
"Let's say at some point you
ended up saying that you only",00:40:34.750,00:40:37.780
have n levels total.,00:40:37.780,00:40:39.185
"So it's not a-- I
should have gone there.",00:40:42.310,00:40:47.240
"The question has to
be posed a little more",00:40:47.240,00:40:49.370
"precisely for the
answer to be order n.",00:40:49.370,00:40:52.560
"You have to have some more
limitations to avoid the case",00:40:52.560,00:40:55.420
"that Eric just mentioned, which
is in the randomized situation",00:40:55.420,00:40:59.960
"you will have the
possibility of getting",00:40:59.960,00:41:03.070
an infinite number of heads.,00:41:03.070,00:41:04.807
"Yeah, question back there.",00:41:04.807,00:41:05.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:41:05.890,00:41:06.806
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yes, you
can certainly do capping",00:41:10.110,00:41:13.060
"and you can do a
bunch of other things.",00:41:13.060,00:41:17.100
"It ends up becoming
something which is not",00:41:17.100,00:41:20.290
as clean as what you have here.,00:41:20.290,00:41:22.320
The analysis is messy.,00:41:22.320,00:41:25.090
"And it's sort of in between
a randomized data structure,",00:41:25.090,00:41:28.792
"a purely randomized
data structure,",00:41:28.792,00:41:30.250
and a deterministic one.,00:41:30.250,00:41:31.840
"I think the important
thing to bring out here",00:41:34.510,00:41:37.130
"is the worst case is much
worse than order log n, OK?",00:41:37.130,00:41:43.571
Cool.,00:41:43.571,00:41:44.070
Good.,00:41:44.070,00:41:44.569
Thanks for those questions.,00:41:44.569,00:41:46.560
"And so what we have here now is
an insert algorithm that could",00:41:46.560,00:41:52.720
make things look pretty messy.,00:41:52.720,00:41:56.890
"I'm going to leave the insert
up here, and that, of course,",00:41:56.890,00:42:00.310
is part of that.,00:42:00.310,00:42:02.380
"Now, for the rest
of the lecture we're",00:42:02.380,00:42:04.890
"going to talk about why
skip lists are good.",00:42:04.890,00:42:08.810
"And we're going to justify
this randomized data structure",00:42:08.810,00:42:12.110
"and show lots of nice
results with respect",00:42:12.110,00:42:16.790
"to the expectation on the
number of levels, expectation",00:42:16.790,00:42:20.680
"on the number of
moves in a search,",00:42:20.680,00:42:22.390
"regardless of what items
you're inserting and deleting.",00:42:22.390,00:42:26.410
One last thing.,00:42:26.410,00:42:27.700
"To delete an item,
you just delete it.",00:42:27.700,00:42:31.900
"You find it, search, and
delete at all levels.",00:42:31.900,00:42:40.258
"So you can't leave it
in any of the levels.",00:42:43.000,00:42:45.150
"So you find it, and you have
to have the pointers set up",00:42:45.150,00:42:47.800
"properly-- move the
previous pointer over",00:42:47.800,00:42:51.980
"to the next one, et
cetera, et cetera.",00:42:51.980,00:42:54.550
"We won't get into
that here, but you",00:42:54.550,00:42:56.520
"have to do the delete
at every level.",00:42:56.520,00:43:01.150
"Yeah, question.",00:43:01.150,00:43:01.880
"AUDIENCE: So what happens
if you inserted 10s",00:43:01.880,00:43:04.380
and you flip off a tail?,00:43:04.380,00:43:06.380
"So that's like your
first element is not",00:43:06.380,00:43:08.720
"going to go up all the way,
and then have you do search.",00:43:08.720,00:43:12.772
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
So typically what",00:43:12.772,00:43:14.230
"happens is you need to
have a minus infinity here.",00:43:14.230,00:43:18.520
And that's a good point.,00:43:18.520,00:43:19.559
It's a corner case.,00:43:19.559,00:43:20.350
"You have to have a
minus infinity that",00:43:20.350,00:43:21.933
goes up all the way.,00:43:21.933,00:43:23.990
Good question.,00:43:23.990,00:43:25.240
"So the question was what happens
if I had something less than 14",00:43:25.240,00:43:28.790
and I inserted it?,00:43:28.790,00:43:29.780
"Well, that doesn't
happen because nothing",00:43:29.780,00:43:31.760
"is less than minus infinity,
and that goes up all the way.",00:43:31.760,00:43:35.040
But thanks for bringing it up.,00:43:35.040,00:43:37.740
"And so we're going to do
a little warm-up Lemma.",00:43:37.740,00:43:43.790
"I don't know if
you've ever heard",00:43:43.790,00:43:45.220
"these two terms in juxtaposition
like this-- warm up and Lemma.",00:43:45.220,00:43:51.520
"But here you go, your
first warm-up Lemma.",00:43:51.520,00:43:54.330
"I guess you'd never
have a warm-up theorem.",00:43:54.330,00:43:57.330
"It's a warm-up Lemma for
this theorem, which is",00:43:57.330,00:44:00.300
going to take a while to prove.,00:44:00.300,00:44:04.060
"This comes down to trying to
get a sense of how many levels",00:44:04.060,00:44:09.470
"you're going to have from
a probabilistic standpoint.",00:44:09.470,00:44:12.540
"The number of levels in
an n element skip list",00:44:12.540,00:44:22.290
is order log n.,00:44:22.290,00:44:24.980
"And I'm going to now define
the term with high probability.",00:44:24.980,00:44:29.740
So what does this mean exactly?,00:44:29.740,00:44:32.500
"Well, what this
means is order log n",00:44:32.500,00:44:35.330
"is something like c
log n plus a constant.",00:44:35.330,00:44:39.040
"Let's ignore the constant
and let's stick with c log n.",00:44:39.040,00:44:43.460
"And with high probability
is a probability",00:44:43.460,00:44:48.640
"that is really a
function of n and alpha.",00:44:48.640,00:44:56.790
"And you have this inverse
polynomial relationship",00:44:56.790,00:45:02.710
"in the sense that
obviously as n grows here,",00:45:02.710,00:45:06.530
"an alpha-- we'll assume that
alpha is greater than the 1--",00:45:06.530,00:45:13.300
"you are going to get a
decrease in this quantity.",00:45:13.300,00:45:19.480
"So this is going to get closer
and closer to 1 as n grows.",00:45:19.480,00:45:23.341
"So that's the difference
between with high probability",00:45:23.341,00:45:25.590
"and just sort of giving you
an expectation number where",00:45:25.590,00:45:27.990
you have no such guarantees.,00:45:27.990,00:45:29.800
"What is interesting about
this is that as n grows,",00:45:29.800,00:45:33.360
"you're going to get a higher
and higher probability.",00:45:33.360,00:45:36.940
"And this constant c is going
to be related to alpha.",00:45:36.940,00:45:41.742
"That's the other thing that's
interesting about this.",00:45:41.742,00:45:43.950
"So it's like saying-- and
you can kind of say this",00:45:43.950,00:45:46.680
"for using Chernoff bounds that
we'll get to in a few minutes,",00:45:46.680,00:45:51.810
even for expectation as well.,00:45:51.810,00:45:54.890
"But what this says is that
if, for example, c doubled,",00:45:54.890,00:46:00.980
"then you are saying that
your number of levels",00:46:00.980,00:46:06.620
is order 4 log n.,00:46:06.620,00:46:08.770
"I mean I understand that that
doesn't make too much sense,",00:46:08.770,00:46:11.250
"but it's less than or equal
to 4 log n plus a constant.",00:46:11.250,00:46:14.620
"And that 4 is going to get
reflected in the alpha here.",00:46:14.620,00:46:18.850
"When the 4 goes from 4 to
8, the alpha increases.",00:46:21.720,00:46:25.380
"So the more room that you have
with respect to this constant,",00:46:25.380,00:46:30.600
the higher the probability.,00:46:30.600,00:46:32.350
"It becomes an
overwhelming probability",00:46:32.350,00:46:34.760
"that you're going to be
within those number of levels.",00:46:34.760,00:46:38.190
"So maybe there's
an 80% probability",00:46:38.190,00:46:41.240
that you're within 2 log n.,00:46:41.240,00:46:44.370
"But there's a
99.99999% probability",00:46:44.370,00:46:47.460
"that you're within 4 log
n, and so on and so forth.",00:46:47.460,00:46:50.430
"So that's the kind of thing
that with the high probability",00:46:50.430,00:46:53.000
analysis tells you explicitly.,00:46:53.000,00:46:56.630
"And so you can do that,
you can do this analysis",00:46:56.630,00:47:00.210
fairly straightforwardly.,00:47:00.210,00:47:03.980
"And let me do that
on a different board.",00:47:03.980,00:47:08.390
"Let me go ahead and
do that over here.",00:47:08.390,00:47:10.410
"Actually, I don't
really need this.",00:47:10.410,00:47:12.328
So let's do that over here.,00:47:12.328,00:47:14.110
"And so this is our first with
high probability analysis.",00:47:18.830,00:47:22.510
"And I want to prove
that warm-up Lemma.",00:47:22.510,00:47:26.210
"So usually what you
do here is you look",00:47:26.210,00:47:28.550
at the failure probability.,00:47:28.550,00:47:30.500
"So with high
probability is typically",00:47:30.500,00:47:32.940
"something that
looks like 1 minus 1",00:47:32.940,00:47:35.980
divided by n raised to alpha.,00:47:35.980,00:47:38.100
"And this part here is
the failure probability.",00:47:38.100,00:47:42.060
"And that's typically
what you analyze",00:47:42.060,00:47:43.750
"and what we're
going to do today.",00:47:43.750,00:47:46.430
"So the failure probability
is that it's not less",00:47:46.430,00:47:49.040
"than c log n levels, is the
complement of what we just",00:47:49.040,00:47:52.560
"looked at, which is the
probability that it's strictly",00:47:52.560,00:47:57.250
greater than c log n levels.,00:47:57.250,00:47:58.836
"And that's the probability
that some element gets promoted",00:48:01.610,00:48:14.710
greater than c log n times.,00:48:14.710,00:48:16.265
"So why would you have
more than c log n levels?",00:48:19.080,00:48:24.120
"It's essentially because
you inserted something",00:48:24.120,00:48:27.030
"and that element got promoted
strictly greater than c",00:48:27.030,00:48:30.930
"log n times, which
obviously implies that you",00:48:30.930,00:48:35.160
"had the sequence
of heads, and we'll",00:48:35.160,00:48:37.320
get to that in just a second.,00:48:37.320,00:48:39.110
"But before we go to that
step of figuring out",00:48:39.110,00:48:43.350
"exactly what's going on here
as to why this got promoted",00:48:43.350,00:48:47.130
"and what the probability
of each promotion",00:48:47.130,00:48:48.880
"is, what I have here is I
have a sequence of inserts",00:48:48.880,00:48:56.760
"potentially that
I have to analyze.",00:48:56.760,00:48:58.790
"And in general, when I
have an n element list,",00:48:58.790,00:49:04.020
"I'm going to assume that
each of these elements",00:49:04.020,00:49:06.440
"got inserted into the
list at some point.",00:49:06.440,00:49:09.540
So I've had n inserts.,00:49:09.540,00:49:11.760
"And we just look at the case
where you have n inserts,",00:49:11.760,00:49:16.050
"you could have deletes, and so
you could have more inserts,",00:49:16.050,00:49:18.690
"but it won't really
change anything.",00:49:18.690,00:49:20.980
"You have n inserts corresponding
to each of these elements,",00:49:20.980,00:49:26.480
"and one of those n elements got
promoted in this failure case",00:49:26.480,00:49:31.310
greater than c log n times.,00:49:31.310,00:49:34.380
"That's essentially
what's happened here.",00:49:34.380,00:49:36.320
"And so you don't know which
one, but you can typically",00:49:36.320,00:49:41.120
"do this in with high
probability analysis",00:49:41.120,00:49:42.930
"because the probabilities
are so small",00:49:42.930,00:49:45.410
"and they're inverse
polynomials, polynomials like n",00:49:45.410,00:49:50.545
raised to alpha.,00:49:50.545,00:49:51.620
"You can use what's
called the union bound",00:49:51.620,00:49:53.330
"that I'm sure you've used before
in some context or the other.",00:49:53.330,00:49:58.180
"And you essentially
say that this",00:49:58.180,00:50:00.500
"is less than or equal
to the probability",00:50:00.500,00:50:03.000
that a particular element x.,00:50:03.000,00:50:06.810
"So you just pick an element,
arbitrary element x,",00:50:06.810,00:50:10.740
but you pick one.,00:50:10.740,00:50:12.720
"Gets promoted greater
than c log n times.",00:50:12.720,00:50:18.830
So you have a small probability.,00:50:18.830,00:50:21.440
"You have no idea whether these
events are independent or not.",00:50:21.440,00:50:24.760
"The union bound
doesn't care about it.",00:50:24.760,00:50:27.750
"It's like saying you've got
a 0.001 probability that any",00:50:27.750,00:50:31.800
"of these elements could get
promoted greater than c log n",00:50:31.800,00:50:35.380
"times, and there's
10 of those elements.",00:50:35.380,00:50:38.980
"You don't know whether they're
independent events or not,",00:50:38.980,00:50:41.560
"but you can certainly
use the union",00:50:41.560,00:50:43.060
"bound that says the overall
failure probability is going",00:50:43.060,00:50:46.620
"to be less than or equal to
n equals 10, in my example,",00:50:46.620,00:50:50.990
times that 0.001.,00:50:50.990,00:50:53.460
That's basically it.,00:50:53.460,00:50:55.680
"Now you can go off
and say, what does it",00:50:55.680,00:50:58.460
"mean for an element
to get promoted?",00:50:58.460,00:51:00.700
"What actually has to happen
for an element to get promoted?",00:51:00.700,00:51:05.040
"And you have n times 1
over 2, because you're",00:51:05.040,00:51:09.970
"flipping a fair
coin, and you are",00:51:09.970,00:51:13.250
getting a c log n heads here.,00:51:13.250,00:51:18.950
"You flip and you
get one promotion.",00:51:18.950,00:51:22.230
"There's two levels
associated with a promotion,",00:51:25.705,00:51:27.800
"the level you came from
and the level you went to.",00:51:27.800,00:51:31.330
"And so a promotion
is a move, so you're",00:51:31.330,00:51:33.980
going to have one more level.,00:51:33.980,00:51:37.530
"If you count levels, then you
have the number of promotions,",00:51:37.530,00:51:40.740
right?,00:51:40.740,00:51:41.670
"That's just simply
corresponds to taking this 1/2",00:51:41.670,00:51:46.510
"and raising it to c log n,
because that's essentially",00:51:46.510,00:51:50.340
"the number of
promotions you have.",00:51:50.340,00:51:55.330
"And you got n 1/2 c log n,
and what does that turn into?",00:51:55.330,00:52:02.950
What is n times 1/2 c log n?,00:52:02.950,00:52:07.990
"1 over 2 raised to
log n would give you?",00:52:07.990,00:52:12.490
2 raised to log ns?,00:52:12.490,00:52:14.790
"Is n, right?",00:52:14.790,00:52:15.590
"So you got n divided
by n raised to c, which",00:52:15.590,00:52:20.510
"is 1 divided by n
raised to c minus 1,",00:52:20.510,00:52:23.920
"which is 1 divided by n
raised to alpha where alpha",00:52:23.920,00:52:27.500
is c minus 1.,00:52:27.500,00:52:30.341
So that's it.,00:52:30.341,00:52:30.882
"That's our first with
high probability analysis.",00:52:30.882,00:52:33.970
Not too hard.,00:52:33.970,00:52:35.550
"What I've done is done
exactly what I just told you",00:52:35.550,00:52:39.140
"that the notion of with
high probability is.",00:52:39.140,00:52:42.770
"You have a failure
probability that is related.",00:52:42.770,00:52:48.050
"Inverse polynomial and the
degree of the polynomial alpha",00:52:48.050,00:52:54.380
is related to c.,00:52:54.380,00:52:55.621
"And so that's what
I have out there,",00:52:55.621,00:52:57.120
but c equals-- what did it have?,00:52:57.120,00:53:00.080
"Alpha equals c minus 1
or c equals alpha plus 1.",00:53:00.080,00:53:04.510
"So what I've done here
is done an analysis",00:53:04.510,00:53:07.090
"that tells you with high
probability how many levels",00:53:07.090,00:53:10.480
"I'm going to have given
my insert algorithm.",00:53:10.480,00:53:14.610
"So this is the first part
of what we'd like to show.",00:53:14.610,00:53:19.290
"This just tells us
how big this skip list",00:53:19.290,00:53:22.050
is going to grow vertically.,00:53:22.050,00:53:24.420
"It doesn't tell us anything
about the structure of the list",00:53:24.420,00:53:29.140
"internally as to whether
the randomization is going",00:53:29.140,00:53:35.110
"to cause that pretty
structure that you see up",00:53:35.110,00:53:37.970
"here to be completely messed up
to the point where we don't get",00:53:37.970,00:53:42.710
"order log n search complexity,
because we are spending way too",00:53:42.710,00:53:46.280
"much time let's say on the
bottom list or the list",00:53:46.280,00:53:49.200
"just above the bottom
list, et cetera.",00:53:49.200,00:53:51.590
"So we need to get a sense of
how the structure corresponding",00:53:51.590,00:53:57.580
"to the skip list, whether it's
going to look somewhat uniform",00:53:57.580,00:54:00.130
or not.,00:54:00.130,00:54:00.630
"We have to categorize
that, and the only way",00:54:00.630,00:54:02.810
"we're going to
characterize that is",00:54:02.810,00:54:04.320
"by analyzing search and
counting the number of moves",00:54:04.320,00:54:08.400
that a search makes.,00:54:08.400,00:54:09.970
"And the reason it's
more complicated",00:54:09.970,00:54:11.510
"than what you see up there
is that in a search, as you",00:54:11.510,00:54:15.660
"can see, you're going to be
moving at different levels.",00:54:15.660,00:54:19.110
"You're going to be
moving at the top level.",00:54:19.110,00:54:21.500
"Maybe at relatively
small number of moves,",00:54:21.500,00:54:24.410
"you're going to pop down one,
move a few moves at that level,",00:54:24.410,00:54:28.130
"pop down, et cetera, et cetera.",00:54:28.130,00:54:30.160
"So there's a lot of things
going on in search which",00:54:30.160,00:54:32.680
"happen at different
levels, and the total cost",00:54:32.680,00:54:35.860
"is going to have to
be all of the moves.",00:54:35.860,00:54:38.920
"So we're going to think
about all of the moves--",00:54:38.920,00:54:42.200
"up moves, down moves,
and add them all up.",00:54:42.200,00:54:45.760
"They all have to be order
log n with high probability.",00:54:45.760,00:54:49.090
"There's no getting around that
because each of them costs you.",00:54:49.090,00:54:52.310
"So that's the thing that we'll
spend the next 20 minutes on.",00:54:52.310,00:54:59.400
"And the theorem that we
like to prove for search",00:54:59.400,00:55:04.640
"is that-- this is
what I just said--",00:55:04.640,00:55:08.140
"any search in an n element skip
list costs order log n w.h.p.",00:55:08.140,00:55:26.920
"So it doesn't matter how
this skip list looks.",00:55:26.920,00:55:30.780
"There's n elements,
they got inserted",00:55:30.780,00:55:32.800
"using the insert
algorithm-- that's",00:55:32.800,00:55:34.510
"important to know if you're
going to have to use that.",00:55:34.510,00:55:37.450
"And when I do a search for an
element, it may be in there,",00:55:37.450,00:55:41.300
it may not be in there.,00:55:41.300,00:55:42.854
Doesn't really matter.,00:55:42.854,00:55:43.770
"We'll assume a
successful search.",00:55:43.770,00:55:46.940
"That is going to cost me order
log n with high probability.",00:55:46.940,00:55:51.200
"And the cool idea here in
terms of analyzing the search",00:55:51.200,00:55:55.130
"in order to figure out
how we're going to add up",00:55:55.130,00:55:58.930
"all of these moves is
we're going to analyze",00:55:58.930,00:56:01.280
the search backwards.,00:56:01.280,00:56:04.470
So that's a cool idea.,00:56:04.470,00:56:05.460
So what does that mean exactly?,00:56:09.350,00:56:12.780
"Well, what that
means is that we're",00:56:12.780,00:56:15.890
"going to think
about this b search,",00:56:15.890,00:56:18.280
"which think of it as the
backward search, starts--",00:56:18.280,00:56:24.470
"it actually ends, so that's what
I'm writing in brackets here,",00:56:24.470,00:56:28.540
at the node in the bottom list.,00:56:28.540,00:56:31.000
"So we're assuming a successful
search, as I mentioned before.",00:56:31.000,00:56:35.300
"Otherwise, the point would
just be in between two members.",00:56:35.300,00:56:40.520
"You know that it's not in there
because you're looking for 67",00:56:40.520,00:56:44.180
"and you see 66 to your
left and 72 to your right.",00:56:44.180,00:56:48.820
"So either way it
works, but keep in mind",00:56:48.820,00:56:51.940
"that it's a successful
search because it just makes",00:56:51.940,00:56:55.340
things a little bit easier.,00:56:55.340,00:56:58.310
"Now, at each node that we
visit, what we're going to do",00:56:58.310,00:57:06.760
"is we're going to say that
if the node was not promoted",00:57:06.760,00:57:16.920
"higher, then what
actually happened here",00:57:16.920,00:57:20.480
"was that when you inserted
that particular element,",00:57:20.480,00:57:24.030
you got a tails.,00:57:24.030,00:57:26.330
"Because otherwise you
would have gotten a heads,",00:57:26.330,00:57:29.020
"that element would have
been promoted higher.",00:57:29.020,00:57:31.820
"Then you go-- and
that really means",00:57:31.820,00:57:38.250
"that you came from the left-hand
side, so you make a left move.",00:57:38.250,00:57:44.200
"Now, search of course makes
down moves and right moves,",00:57:44.200,00:57:47.820
"but this is a backward search
so it's going to make left moves",00:57:47.820,00:57:50.680
and up moves.,00:57:50.680,00:57:53.750
What else do I have here?,00:57:53.750,00:57:55.390
"Running out of room, so let
me-- let's continue with that.",00:57:55.390,00:58:06.400
All right.,00:58:18.100,00:58:19.320
"And now the case is if
the node was promoted",00:58:19.320,00:58:29.050
"higher, that means
we got heads here",00:58:29.050,00:58:34.510
in that particular insertion.,00:58:34.510,00:58:36.790
"Then we go, and that means
that during the search",00:58:36.790,00:58:43.990
we came from upstairs.,00:58:43.990,00:58:49.280
"And then lastly, we
stop, which means",00:58:49.280,00:58:52.830
"we start when we reach the top
level or minus infinity if we",00:58:52.830,00:59:06.070
go all the way back.,00:59:06.070,00:59:08.630
So that's it.,00:59:08.630,00:59:10.100
"A lot of writing here, but
this should make things clear.",00:59:10.100,00:59:13.360
"So let's say that
we're searching for 66.",00:59:13.360,00:59:18.020
"I want to trace through what
the backwards path would",00:59:18.020,00:59:20.430
"look like, and keep that
code in mind as I do this.",00:59:20.430,00:59:24.890
"So I'm searching for
66, and obviously, we",00:59:24.890,00:59:27.717
know how to find it.,00:59:27.717,00:59:28.550
We've done that.,00:59:28.550,00:59:29.470
"But let's go backwards
as to what exactly",00:59:29.470,00:59:32.650
happened when we look for 66.,00:59:32.650,00:59:36.380
"When we look for 66, right at
this point when you see 66,",00:59:36.380,00:59:42.230
where would you have come from?,00:59:42.230,00:59:43.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:59:43.790,00:59:44.665
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: You'd
have come from the top.",00:59:44.665,00:59:46.880
"And so if you go look
at what happens here,",00:59:46.880,00:59:50.600
"the node when it got inserted
was promoted one level.",00:59:50.600,00:59:54.800
"So that means that you would go
up top in the backward search",00:59:54.800,00:59:59.591
first.,00:59:59.591,01:00:00.090
"Your first move would
be going up like that.",01:00:00.090,01:00:03.140
"Now, if there's a 66 up there,
you would go up one more.",01:00:03.140,01:00:07.390
"But there's not, so you go left.",01:00:07.390,01:00:09.340
You go to 50.,01:00:12.270,01:00:13.720
"And when you have a 50 up here,
would you stay on this level?",01:00:13.720,01:00:17.310
AUDIENCE: No.,01:00:17.310,01:00:18.291
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: No.,01:00:18.291,01:00:19.166
"You'd go up to 50
because the first chance",01:00:19.166,01:00:22.690
"you get you want to get
up to the higher levels.",01:00:22.690,01:00:26.020
"And again, this 50 was
promoted so you go up there,",01:00:26.020,01:00:28.215
"and you go to 14, and pretty
much that's the end of that.",01:00:28.215,01:00:33.230
"So this would look like you go
like that, you have an up move,",01:00:33.230,01:00:38.860
"then you have a left move--
different colors here",01:00:38.860,01:00:42.860
"would be good-- then
you have an up move,",01:00:42.860,01:00:47.570
"and a left, and then an up.",01:00:47.570,01:00:52.270
So that's our backward search.,01:00:52.270,01:00:55.140
"And it's not that
complicated, hopefully.",01:00:55.140,01:00:58.940
"If you're looking for
66 or 59, you do that.",01:00:58.940,01:01:01.980
"So it's much more natural,
and you just need to flip it.",01:01:01.980,01:01:05.710
Why am I doing all this?,01:01:05.710,01:01:07.520
"Well, the reason
I'm doing all this",01:01:07.520,01:01:09.720
"is that I have to do some
bounding of the moves,",01:01:09.720,01:01:15.770
"and I know that the moves that
correspond to the up moves",01:01:15.770,01:01:21.350
"are probabilistic in the sense
that the reason I'm making them",01:01:21.350,01:01:25.280
"is because I flipped
heads at some point.",01:01:25.280,01:01:29.170
"So all of this is going
to turn into counting",01:01:29.170,01:01:32.560
"how many coin flips
come out heads",01:01:32.560,01:01:36.350
in a long stream of coin flips.,01:01:36.350,01:01:39.672
"So that's what this
backward search",01:01:39.672,01:01:41.130
is going to allow us to do.,01:01:41.130,01:01:42.630
"And that crucial thing is
what we'll look at next.",01:01:42.630,01:01:47.270
"So the analysis itself
is a bit painful,",01:01:47.270,01:01:50.730
but there's a bunch of algebra.,01:01:50.730,01:01:52.139
"But what I want to
do is to make sure",01:01:52.139,01:01:53.680
"that you get the high
level picture, number one,",01:01:53.680,01:01:57.950
"and the insights as to why
the expected value or the with",01:01:57.950,01:02:08.500
"high probability value is
going to be order log n.",01:02:08.500,01:02:10.810
But the key is the strategy.,01:02:10.810,01:02:13.164
"So we're going to
go off and we're",01:02:13.164,01:02:14.580
going to prove this theorem.,01:02:14.580,01:02:15.746
"Our backward search makes
up moves and left moves.",01:02:22.080,01:02:38.330
We know that.,01:02:38.330,01:02:38.900
Each with probability 1/2.,01:02:42.480,01:02:48.310
"And the reason for
that is when you go up",01:02:48.310,01:02:52.910
"is because you got
a heads, and if you",01:02:52.910,01:02:55.050
"didn't get a heads in you got a
tails, that meant you go left.",01:02:55.050,01:02:58.880
"Because of the previous
element, every time you're",01:02:58.880,01:03:01.960
"passing these elements
that are inserted,",01:03:01.960,01:03:06.230
"and they were inserted
by flipping coins.",01:03:06.230,01:03:09.660
So that's key point number one.,01:03:09.660,01:03:13.436
"All of that, if you look
at what happens here",01:03:13.436,01:03:15.310
"when I drew this out,
you got heads here",01:03:15.310,01:03:17.650
and you got tails there.,01:03:17.650,01:03:19.630
"So each of those
things for a fair coin",01:03:19.630,01:03:21.460
"is happening with
probability 1/2.",01:03:21.460,01:03:23.370
"And it's all about
coin flips here.",01:03:23.370,01:03:26.120
"Now, the number
of moves going up",01:03:26.120,01:03:38.700
"is less than the number of
levels-- the number of levels",01:03:38.700,01:03:44.750
is one more than that.,01:03:44.750,01:03:46.100
"And we've shown that that's
c log n with high probability",01:03:46.100,01:03:52.230
by the warm-up Lemma.,01:03:52.230,01:03:53.480
That's what this just did.,01:03:53.480,01:03:55.370
"The number of up moves-- I mean
you can't go off the list here.",01:03:55.370,01:03:59.540
"This list is now you're
not inserting anymore,",01:03:59.540,01:04:01.720
you're doing a search.,01:04:01.720,01:04:02.840
"So it's not like you're
going to be adding",01:04:02.840,01:04:04.750
levels or anything like that.,01:04:04.750,01:04:06.460
"So the number of up moves
we've taken care of.",01:04:06.460,01:04:09.070
"So this last thing here which
I'm going to write out here",01:04:09.070,01:04:11.970
"is the key observation,
which is going to make",01:04:11.970,01:04:15.600
the whole analysis possible.,01:04:15.600,01:04:17.880
"And so this last thing it
says that the total number",01:04:17.880,01:04:23.400
"of moves-- so now the total
number of moves has to include,",01:04:23.400,01:04:27.260
"obviously, the up
moves and the left",01:04:27.260,01:04:28.820
"moves, and there's
no other kind.",01:04:28.820,01:04:30.470
"The total number
of moves is going",01:04:33.146,01:04:38.770
"to correspond to
the number of moves",01:04:38.770,01:04:51.258
till you get c log n up moves.,01:04:51.258,01:05:04.317
So what does that mean?,01:05:07.570,01:05:09.720
"There's some sequence
of heads and tails",01:05:09.720,01:05:11.530
"that I'm getting, each of
them with probability 1/2.",01:05:11.530,01:05:15.270
"Every time that I got a
heads, I moved up a level.",01:05:15.270,01:05:19.090
"The fact of the matter is that
I can't get more than c log n",01:05:19.090,01:05:23.140
"heads because I'm going
to run out of levels.",01:05:23.140,01:05:27.000
That's it.,01:05:27.000,01:05:28.980
"I'm going to run out of room
vertically if I keep popping up",01:05:28.980,01:05:33.530
and keep doing up moves.,01:05:33.530,01:05:35.700
"So at that point I'm
forced to go left.",01:05:35.700,01:05:39.484
"Maybe I'm going
left in the middle",01:05:39.484,01:05:40.900
"there when I still
had a chance to go up.",01:05:40.900,01:05:44.220
"That corresponds to getting a
tails as opposed to a heads.",01:05:44.220,01:05:47.390
"But I can limit the
total number of moves",01:05:47.390,01:05:50.910
"from a probabilistic
standpoint by saying",01:05:50.910,01:05:53.850
"during that sequence
of coin flips I only",01:05:53.850,01:05:57.370
"have a certain number
of heads that I",01:05:57.370,01:05:59.500
could have possibly gotten.,01:05:59.500,01:06:01.080
"Because if I got more heads
than that, I would be up top.",01:06:01.080,01:06:04.910
"I'd be out of the skip
list, and that doesn't work.",01:06:04.910,01:06:10.120
"So the total number of
moves is the number of moves",01:06:10.120,01:06:13.210
"till you get c log n up moves,
which essentially corresponds",01:06:13.210,01:06:18.720
"to-- now, forget about
skip lists for a second.",01:06:18.720,01:06:24.210
"Our claim is the
total number of moves",01:06:24.210,01:06:28.590
"is the number of coin flips,
so these are the same,",01:06:28.590,01:06:33.950
"because every move
corresponds to a coin flip.",01:06:33.950,01:06:37.090
"Until-- it's a fair
coin, probability 1/2--",01:06:37.090,01:06:41.720
"until c log n heads
have been obtained.",01:06:41.720,01:06:49.620
"So the number of
coin flips until c",01:06:49.620,01:06:52.800
"log n heads is the
total number of moves.",01:06:52.800,01:06:56.880
This equals that.,01:06:56.880,01:06:57.920
"And what we now want to show, if
you believe that, and hopefully",01:07:00.450,01:07:06.600
"you do because the
argument is simply",01:07:06.600,01:07:08.480
"that you run out of levels,
that this is order log n w.h.p.",01:07:08.480,01:07:15.740
That's why it's a claim.,01:07:15.740,01:07:17.450
"So the observation is
that the number of coin",01:07:17.450,01:07:21.550
"flips, as you flip a
fair coin, until you",01:07:21.550,01:07:24.330
"get c log n heads will give
you the number of moves",01:07:24.330,01:07:28.700
"in your search, total number
of moves in your search.",01:07:28.700,01:07:33.270
"It includes the up moves
as well as the left moves.",01:07:33.270,01:07:35.880
"And now what we have
to show is that that",01:07:35.880,01:07:41.220
"is going to be order log
n with high probability.",01:07:41.220,01:07:44.150
OK?,01:07:44.150,01:07:45.240
"And then once you do that
you've done two things.",01:07:45.240,01:07:48.650
"You've bounded the number
of levels in the skip list",01:07:48.650,01:07:55.830
"to be order log n
with high probability.",01:07:55.830,01:07:58.910
"And you've said the number
of moves in the search",01:07:58.910,01:08:01.470
"is order log n with high
probability assuming",01:08:01.470,01:08:06.110
"that the number of levels
is c log n, obviously.",01:08:06.110,01:08:11.240
"So it's not that the bottom
one subsumes the top one.",01:08:11.240,01:08:15.650
"It's the last thing to
keep in mind as we get all",01:08:15.650,01:08:18.560
of these items out of the way.,01:08:18.560,01:08:22.520
"This assumes that there are
less than or equal to c log n",01:08:22.520,01:08:26.439
levels.,01:08:26.439,01:08:27.155
"That's the only reason why
I could make an argument",01:08:27.155,01:08:29.279
that I've run out of levels.,01:08:29.279,01:08:31.149
"So if I have this event A
here-- if I call this event A,",01:08:31.149,01:08:35.036
"and I have this event
B, what I really want",01:08:35.036,01:08:39.510
"is-- I've shown you that event
A happens with high probability.",01:08:39.510,01:08:43.390
That's the warm-up Lemma.,01:08:43.390,01:08:45.149
"I need to show you that event B
happens with high probability.",01:08:45.149,01:08:48.649
"And then I have to show you
that event A and event B",01:08:48.649,01:08:51.680
"happen with high probability,
because I need both.",01:08:51.680,01:08:56.490
Any questions?,01:08:56.490,01:08:57.149
We're stopping a minute here.,01:08:57.149,01:08:59.460
"The rest of the analysis,
a bunch of algebra,",01:08:59.460,01:09:01.870
"we'll get through it, you
can look at the notes.",01:09:01.870,01:09:03.910
This is the key point.,01:09:03.910,01:09:05.920
"If you got this, you got it.",01:09:05.920,01:09:08.762
Yeah.,01:09:08.762,01:09:09.262
"AUDIENCE: Can you just say
that because the probability",01:09:09.262,01:09:11.553
"of drawing an up move
instead of a left move",01:09:11.553,01:09:15.869

number of left moves",01:09:15.869,01:09:21.265

"SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
So the argument",01:09:26.649,01:09:28.229
"is that since you
have 1/2, can you",01:09:28.229,01:09:32.410
"simply say that the expected
number of left moves",01:09:32.410,01:09:37.470

the same as the up moves?",01:09:37.470,01:09:40.490
"You can make arguments
about expectation.",01:09:40.490,01:09:42.790

the number of left moves",01:09:42.790,01:09:46.200

going to be two in expectation.",01:09:46.200,01:09:50.090

with high probability proof.",01:09:50.090,01:09:54.290

just wanted to show expectation",01:09:58.630,01:10:02.430

making the assumptions",01:10:08.400,01:10:11.270
"that I've made explicit
here through my observations",01:10:11.270,01:10:13.927
when you do that expectation.,01:10:13.927,01:10:15.135

a precise proof of expected",01:10:15.135,01:10:19.540
"value for search
complexity, you would",01:10:19.540,01:10:22.320

things that I'm doing here.",01:10:22.320,01:10:25.880
"I'm not saying you
waved your hands.",01:10:25.880,01:10:27.380

than what you just said.",01:10:30.120,01:10:34.220
OK?,01:10:34.220,01:10:35.820
"So this is pretty much
what the analysis is.",01:10:35.820,01:10:40.580
"With high probability analysis
we bounded the vertical,",01:10:40.580,01:10:43.800

"SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
It's somewhere.",01:11:04.150,01:11:05.525
All right.,01:11:06.901,01:11:07.400
Good.,01:11:07.400,01:11:08.270
"So let's do what
we can with respect",01:11:08.270,01:11:10.780
to showing this theorem.,01:11:10.780,01:11:14.980
"There's a couple ways
that you could prove this.",01:11:14.980,01:11:17.810
"There's a way that you
could use a Chernoff bound.",01:11:17.810,01:11:26.910
"And this is kind
of a cool result",01:11:26.910,01:11:29.840
that I think is worth knowing.,01:11:29.840,01:11:32.700
"I don't know if
you've seen this,",01:11:32.700,01:11:34.430
"but this is a seminal
theorem by Chernoff",01:11:34.430,01:11:38.430
"that says if you have a
random variable representing",01:11:38.430,01:11:55.220
"the total number of
tails, let's say--",01:11:55.220,01:12:00.700
"it could be heads as
well-- in a series of m--",01:12:00.700,01:12:08.310
"not n, m-- independent coin
flips where each flip has",01:12:08.310,01:12:22.110
"a probability p of
coming up heads,",01:12:22.110,01:12:30.200
"then for all r greater
than 0, we have",01:12:30.200,01:12:38.750
"this beautiful result that
says the probability that y,",01:12:38.750,01:12:45.040
"which is a random variable--
a particular instance",01:12:45.040,01:12:53.320
"when you evaluate
it-- that it is larger",01:12:53.320,01:12:58.980
"than the expectation
by r is bounded.",01:12:58.980,01:13:03.210
"So just a beautiful
result that says here's",01:13:03.210,01:13:07.560
"a random variable that
corresponds to flipping a coin.",01:13:07.560,01:13:12.520
"I'm going to flip
this a bunch of times,",01:13:12.520,01:13:15.700
"and I know what
the expectation is.",01:13:15.700,01:13:17.510
"If it's a fair coin
of 1/2, then I'm",01:13:17.510,01:13:21.790
"going to get m over 2--
expected number of heads",01:13:21.790,01:13:24.400
is going to be m over 2.,01:13:24.400,01:13:25.760
"Expected number of tails
is going to be m over 2.",01:13:25.760,01:13:28.040
"If it's p, then obviously
it's a little bit",01:13:28.040,01:13:30.190
different-- p times m.,01:13:30.190,01:13:32.600
"But what I have here is if you
tell me what the probability is",01:13:32.600,01:13:37.850
"that I'm 10 away
from the expectation",01:13:37.850,01:13:40.500
"and that would imply that r is
10, then that is bounded by e",01:13:40.500,01:13:44.670
"raised to minus 2 times
10 square divided by m.",01:13:44.670,01:13:48.240
So that's Chernoff's bound.,01:13:48.240,01:13:50.369

to our with high probability",01:13:50.369,01:13:52.910
analysis.,01:13:52.910,01:13:53.860

get further and further away",01:14:01.690,01:14:04.730
"from the average or you get
further and further away",01:14:04.730,01:14:07.460

the probability is that you're",01:14:07.460,01:14:10.090
going to be so far away.,01:14:10.090,01:14:11.960
"What is the probability that in
100 coin flips that are fair,",01:14:11.960,01:14:19.260
you get 50 heads?,01:14:19.260,01:14:22.390
"It's a reasonably large number
because the expected value",01:14:22.390,01:14:25.440
corresponds to 50.,01:14:25.440,01:14:28.590
So r is 0.,01:14:28.590,01:14:30.470
"So that just says
this is a-- well,",01:14:30.470,01:14:32.755
"it doesn't tell you much
because this says it's less than",01:14:32.755,01:14:35.130
or equal to 1.,01:14:35.130,01:14:36.750
That's all it's says.,01:14:36.750,01:14:38.400
"But if you had 75, what are
the probability that you",01:14:38.400,01:14:43.360
"get 75 heads when you
flip a coin 100 times?",01:14:43.360,01:14:48.370
"Then e of y for a fair coin
would be 50, r would be 25,",01:14:48.370,01:14:53.390
"and you'd go off and you
could do the math for that.",01:14:53.390,01:14:56.220
"So it's a beautiful
relationship that tells you",01:14:56.220,01:14:59.670
"how the probabilities change as
your random variable value is",01:14:59.670,01:15:05.050
"further and further away
from the expectation.",01:15:05.050,01:15:07.880
"And you can imagine
that this is going",01:15:07.880,01:15:09.900
"to be very useful in showing our
with high probability result.",01:15:09.900,01:15:19.110
"And I think what I
have time for is just",01:15:19.110,01:15:22.760
"to give you a sense of how
this result works out-- I'm not",01:15:22.760,01:15:27.810
going to do the algebra.,01:15:27.810,01:15:28.960
"I don't think it's worth it to
write all of this on the board",01:15:28.960,01:15:32.610
"when you can read
it in the notes.",01:15:32.610,01:15:35.340
"But the bottom
line is we're going",01:15:35.340,01:15:37.260
"to show this little Lemma
that says for any c,",01:15:37.260,01:15:47.730
"invoking this Chernoff
bound, there's a constant d,",01:15:47.730,01:15:53.330
"such that with high
probability, the number of heads",01:15:53.330,01:16:05.406
in flipping d log n.,01:16:05.406,01:16:09.510
So I have a new constant here.,01:16:09.510,01:16:11.240
"d log n fair coins,
or a single fair coin,",01:16:11.240,01:16:15.830
"d log n times,
assuming independence,",01:16:15.830,01:16:20.040
is at least c log n.,01:16:20.040,01:16:23.380
So what does this say?,01:16:23.380,01:16:24.780
A lot of words.,01:16:24.780,01:16:26.390
"It just says, hey, you
want an order log n",01:16:26.390,01:16:32.320
bound here eventually.,01:16:32.320,01:16:34.270
"The beauty of order log n
is that there's a constant",01:16:34.270,01:16:36.590
in there that you control.,01:16:36.590,01:16:38.760
That constant is d.,01:16:38.760,01:16:41.420
"So you tell me
that c log n is 50.",01:16:41.420,01:16:46.530
So c log n is 50.,01:16:46.530,01:16:49.590
"Then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to say something like,",01:16:49.590,01:16:52.570
"well, if I flip a
coin 1,000 times, then",01:16:52.570,01:17:00.760
"I'm going to have an
overwhelming probability",01:17:00.760,01:17:02.970
that I'm going to get 50 heads.,01:17:02.970,01:17:06.070
And that's it.,01:17:06.070,01:17:06.860
That's what the Lemma says.,01:17:06.860,01:17:10.040
It says tell me what c log n is.,01:17:10.040,01:17:12.900
Give me that value.,01:17:12.900,01:17:14.430
"And I will find you a d, such
that by invoking Chernoff,",01:17:14.430,01:17:18.970
"I'm going to show you an
overwhelming probability that",01:17:18.970,01:17:22.250
"for that d you're going to
get at least c log n heads.",01:17:22.250,01:17:25.924
So everybody buy that?,01:17:25.924,01:17:26.840
"Make sense from what
you see up there?",01:17:26.840,01:17:30.117
Yup?,01:17:30.117,01:17:31.520
"So this essentially
can be shown--",01:17:31.520,01:17:33.920
"it turns out that
what you have to do",01:17:33.920,01:17:35.640
"is-- and you don't
have to choose 8,",01:17:35.640,01:17:38.110
but you can choose d equals 8c.,01:17:38.110,01:17:41.620
"Just choose d
equals 8c and you'll",01:17:41.620,01:17:44.030
"see the algebra in the
notes corresponding to what",01:17:44.030,01:17:48.100
each of these values are.,01:17:48.100,01:17:49.560
"So e of y, just to tell
you, would be m over 2.",01:17:49.560,01:17:54.570
"You're flipping m coins, fair
coin with probability 1/2.",01:17:54.570,01:17:58.940
So you got m over 2.,01:17:58.940,01:18:01.075
"And then the last
thing that I'll",01:18:01.075,01:18:02.450
"tell you is that what you want
in terms of invoking that,",01:18:02.450,01:18:08.980
"you want r-- remember we were
talking about tails here-- so r",01:18:08.980,01:18:12.660
"is going to be d
log n minus c log n.",01:18:12.660,01:18:18.990
"So you just invoke Chernoff
with e of y equals m over 2.",01:18:18.990,01:18:23.780
"And what you're saying here
is you want c log n heads.",01:18:23.780,01:18:27.370
"You want to make sure you
get c log n heads, which",01:18:27.370,01:18:34.195
"means that the number
of tails is going",01:18:34.195,01:18:35.820
to be d log n minus c log n.,01:18:35.820,01:18:38.390
"And typically we analyze
failure probability,",01:18:38.390,01:18:41.610
"so what this is is this is
going to be a tiny number.",01:18:41.610,01:18:45.180
"So the failure is when you
get fewer than c log n heads.",01:18:45.180,01:18:51.350
"So the failure is when you
get fewer than c log n heads.",01:18:51.350,01:18:54.140
"And so that means that you're
getting more than d log",01:18:54.140,01:18:59.585
"n minus c log n tails as
you're flipping this coin.",01:18:59.585,01:19:04.330
"Fewer than c log n heads means
you're getting at least d log",01:19:04.330,01:19:07.910
n minus c log n tails.,01:19:07.910,01:19:10.030
"So that's why this
is your r here.",01:19:10.030,01:19:12.130
"And then when your
r gets that large,",01:19:12.130,01:19:14.360
"and you can play around
with the d and the c",01:19:14.360,01:19:16.400
"and choose d equals
8c, you realize",01:19:16.400,01:19:19.580
"that this is going to be
a minuscule probability.",01:19:19.580,01:19:22.640
"And you can turn that
around to a polynomial--",01:19:22.640,01:19:27.790
"again, a little bit of algebra.",01:19:27.790,01:19:29.180
"But you can show
this result on here",01:19:29.180,01:19:32.990
"that says that
the number of coin",01:19:32.990,01:19:34.820
"flips until c log n
heads is order log",01:19:34.820,01:19:37.745
"n with high probability
by appropriately",01:19:37.745,01:19:39.940
"choosing the constant d to
be some time/number over c.",01:19:39.940,01:19:45.700
So I'll let you do that algebra.,01:19:45.700,01:19:47.250
"But this one last thing
that-- we're not quite done.",01:19:47.250,01:19:51.100
"So you thought we were done,
but we're not quite done.",01:19:51.100,01:19:53.880
"And why is it that
we're not quite done?",01:19:53.880,01:19:58.220
"Real quick question
worth five Frisbees.",01:19:58.220,01:20:02.370
"Why is it that we're
not quite done?",01:20:02.370,01:20:04.620
What did I say?,01:20:04.620,01:20:05.840
"I have done event A
and event B, right?",01:20:05.840,01:20:08.733
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,01:20:08.733,01:20:10.100
"SRINIVAS DEVADAS: I haven't
done the last thing which",01:20:10.100,01:20:13.800
"is to show that probability
of event A-- this",01:20:13.800,01:20:22.070
"is with high
probability happens--",01:20:22.070,01:20:25.250
"and I need to show
that probability",01:20:25.250,01:20:26.910
"of event A and event
B happens-- or this",01:20:26.910,01:20:33.385
is with high probability.,01:20:33.385,01:20:34.967
"Or I should just say
event A and event",01:20:34.967,01:20:36.550
B happen with high probability.,01:20:36.550,01:20:42.510
And you can see that.,01:20:42.510,01:20:43.470
"It turns out it's
pretty straightforward,",01:20:43.470,01:20:45.480
but you got the gist of it.,01:20:45.480,01:20:47.440
Thanks for being so patient.,01:20:47.440,01:20:49.020
And there you go guys.,01:20:49.020,01:20:51.870
Woah.,01:20:51.870,01:20:53.420
