"PROFESSOR: Let's
say that I tell you",00:00:29.960,00:00:31.640
"that I'm interested in a gas
that has some temperature.",00:00:31.640,00:00:37.870
"I specify, let's
say, temperature.",00:00:37.870,00:00:39.910
"Pressure is room
temperature, room pressure.",00:00:39.910,00:00:42.560
"And I tell you how
many particles I have.",00:00:42.560,00:00:45.560
"So that's [INAUDIBLE] for
you what the macro state is.",00:00:45.560,00:00:50.870
"And I want to then see what the
corresponding micro state is.",00:00:50.870,00:00:55.690
"So I take one of these
boxes, whereas this is a box",00:00:55.690,00:01:01.010
"that I draw in three dimensions,
I can make a correspondence",00:01:01.010,00:01:05.290
"and draw this is 6N-dimensional
coordinate space, which",00:01:05.290,00:01:09.060
would be hard for me to draw.,00:01:09.060,00:01:10.960
"But basically, a space
of six n dimensions.",00:01:10.960,00:01:13.850
"I figure out where the
position, and the particles,",00:01:13.850,00:01:17.030
and the momenta are.,00:01:17.030,00:01:18.590
"And I sort of find that there
is a corresponding micro state",00:01:18.590,00:01:22.270
"that corresponds to
this macro state.",00:01:22.270,00:01:25.270
"OK, that's fine.",00:01:25.270,00:01:26.180
I made the correspondence.,00:01:26.180,00:01:28.500
"But the thing is that I can
imagine lots and lots of boxes",00:01:28.500,00:01:37.410
"that have exactly the same
macroscopic properties.",00:01:37.410,00:01:40.910
"That is, I can imagine
putting here side by side",00:01:40.910,00:01:45.660
a huge number of these boxes.,00:01:45.660,00:01:48.460
"All of them are described
by exactly the same volume,",00:01:48.460,00:01:53.230
"pressure, temperature,
for example.",00:01:53.230,00:01:55.600
The same macro state.,00:01:55.600,00:01:57.760
"But for each one of them, when
I go and find the macro state,",00:01:57.760,00:02:02.260
"I find that it is
something else.",00:02:02.260,00:02:04.090
"So I will be having
different micro states.",00:02:06.880,00:02:12.210
"So this correspondence
is certainly",00:02:12.210,00:02:15.390
"something where
there should be many,",00:02:15.390,00:02:17.980
"many points here that correspond
to the same thermodynamic",00:02:17.980,00:02:25.160
representation.,00:02:25.160,00:02:27.510
"So faced with that,
maybe it makes sense",00:02:27.510,00:02:31.330
"to follow Gibbs and
define an ensemble.",00:02:31.330,00:02:35.610
"So what we say is,
we are interested",00:02:40.250,00:02:42.950
in some particular macro state.,00:02:42.950,00:02:46.140
"We know that they correspond
to many, many, many",00:02:46.140,00:02:49.170
"different potential
micro states.",00:02:49.170,00:02:52.070
"Let's try to make a map of
as many micro states that",00:02:52.070,00:02:57.380
"correspond to the
same macro state.",00:02:57.380,00:03:00.190
"So consider n copies of
the same macro state.",00:03:00.190,00:03:13.620
"And this would correspond
to n different points",00:03:13.620,00:03:17.370
"that I put in this
6N-dimensional phase space.",00:03:17.370,00:03:21.820
"And what I can do is I can
define an ensemble density.",00:03:21.820,00:03:24.940
"I go to a particular
point in this space.",00:03:33.440,00:03:40.160
"So let's say I pick some
point that corresponds",00:03:40.160,00:03:44.230
to some set of p's and q's here.,00:03:44.230,00:03:46.510
"And what I do is
I draw a box that",00:03:52.370,00:03:55.007
"is 6N-dimensional
around this point.",00:03:55.007,00:04:01.890
"And I define a density
in the vicinity",00:04:01.890,00:04:06.100
"of that point, as follows.",00:04:06.100,00:04:08.455
"Actually, yeah.",00:04:12.520,00:04:16.880
"What I will do is I will
count how many of these points",00:04:16.880,00:04:23.280
"that correspond to micro
states fall within this box.",00:04:23.280,00:04:33.200
"So at the end is the number
of mu points in this box.",00:04:33.200,00:04:45.165
"And what I do is I divide
by the total number.",00:04:49.010,00:04:56.900
"I expect that the result
will be proportional",00:04:56.900,00:05:00.220
to the volume of the box.,00:05:00.220,00:05:02.220
"So if I make the box
bigger, I will have more.",00:05:02.220,00:05:05.650
"So I divide by the
volume of the box.",00:05:05.650,00:05:09.950
"So this is, let's call d
gamma is the volume of box.",00:05:09.950,00:05:14.280
"Of course, I have
to do this in order",00:05:19.280,00:05:22.190
"to get a nice result by
taking the limit where",00:05:22.190,00:05:27.430
"the number of members of the
ensemble becomes quite large.",00:05:27.430,00:05:32.330
"And then presumably, this will
give me a well-behaved density.",00:05:32.330,00:05:37.830
"In this limit, I guess I want
to also have the size of the box",00:05:37.830,00:05:41.870
go to 0.,00:05:41.870,00:05:44.650
OK?,00:05:44.650,00:05:47.600
"Now, clearly, with
the definitions",00:05:47.600,00:05:50.370
"that I have made, if
I were to integrate",00:05:50.370,00:05:54.090
"this quantity against the
volume d gamma, what I would get",00:05:54.090,00:06:05.290
"is the integral dN over N.
N is, of course, a constant.",00:06:05.290,00:06:09.990
"And the integral of dN
is the total number.",00:06:09.990,00:06:12.850
So this is 1.,00:06:12.850,00:06:15.490
"So we find that this quantity
rho that I have constructed",00:06:15.490,00:06:19.410
satisfies two properties.,00:06:19.410,00:06:21.180
"Certainly, it is
positive, because I'm",00:06:21.180,00:06:23.020
counting the number of points.,00:06:23.020,00:06:24.720
"Secondly, it's normalized to 1.",00:06:24.720,00:06:27.030
"So this is a nice
probability density.",00:06:27.030,00:06:29.970
"So this ensemble density is a
probability density function",00:06:29.970,00:06:37.250
"in this phase space
that I have defined.",00:06:37.250,00:06:41.040
OK?,00:06:41.040,00:06:43.490
All right.,00:06:43.490,00:06:44.620
"So once I have a
probability, then I",00:06:44.620,00:06:48.850
"can calculate various
things according",00:06:48.850,00:06:52.230
"to the rules of probability
that we defined before.",00:06:52.230,00:06:55.260
"So for example, I can
define an ensemble average.",00:06:55.260,00:06:59.185
"Maybe I'm interested
in the kinetic energy",00:07:03.000,00:07:05.560
of the particles of the gas.,00:07:05.560,00:07:08.320
"So there is a function
O that depends",00:07:08.320,00:07:12.090
"on the sum of all
of the p squareds.",00:07:12.090,00:07:15.260
"In general, I have some function
of O that depends on p and q.",00:07:15.260,00:07:20.570
"And what I defined the ensemble
average would be the average",00:07:20.570,00:07:25.350
"that I would calculate
with this probability.",00:07:25.350,00:07:28.010
"Because I go over all of
the points in phase space.",00:07:28.010,00:07:31.690
"And let me again emphasize
that what I call d gamma",00:07:31.690,00:07:34.900
"then really is the
product over all points.",00:07:34.900,00:07:41.230
"For each point, I have to
make a volume in both momentum",00:07:41.230,00:07:46.290
and in coordinate.,00:07:46.290,00:07:48.090
"It's a 6N-dimensional
volume element.",00:07:48.090,00:07:51.650
"I have to multiply
the probability, which",00:07:51.650,00:07:55.380
"is a function of p and
q against this O, which",00:07:55.380,00:07:59.980
is another function of p and q.,00:07:59.980,00:08:04.310
Yes?,00:08:04.310,00:08:05.241
"AUDIENCE: Is the
division by M necessary",00:08:05.241,00:08:07.696
"to make it into a
probability density?",00:08:07.696,00:08:09.958
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:08:09.958,00:08:10.583
"AUDIENCE: Otherwise, you
would still have a density.",00:08:10.583,00:08:13.544
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:08:13.544,00:08:14.210
"When I would integrate then,
I would get the total number.",00:08:14.210,00:08:18.210
"But the total
number is up to me,",00:08:18.210,00:08:20.380
"how many members of
the ensemble I took,",00:08:20.380,00:08:22.650
"it's not a very
well-defined quantity.",00:08:22.650,00:08:25.250
It's an arbitrary quantity.,00:08:25.250,00:08:26.710
"If I set it to become very
large and divide by it,",00:08:26.710,00:08:29.940
"then I will get something
that is nicely a probability.",00:08:29.940,00:08:33.100
"And we've developed
all of these tools",00:08:33.100,00:08:35.590
for dealing with probabilities.,00:08:35.590,00:08:37.299

if I don't divide by.",00:08:37.299,00:08:40.982
Yes?,00:08:40.982,00:08:41.944

you have set numbers,",00:08:42.906,00:08:45.792

generate infinite number",00:10:02.950,00:10:06.540

the case when, like,",00:10:06.540,00:10:10.560
"all molecules of gas are
in right half of the box?",00:10:10.560,00:10:13.960
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:10:13.960,00:10:15.282
"Is that a thermodynamically
equilibrium state?",00:10:15.282,00:10:17.602

mention it needed to be?",00:10:17.602,00:10:19.352
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:10:19.352,00:10:20.990

"that can be described
macroscopically.",00:10:23.500,00:10:27.186
"Now, the thing
that you mentioned",00:10:27.186,00:10:28.560
"is actually something that
I would like to work with,",00:10:28.560,00:10:32.300
"because ultimately,
my goal is not only",00:10:32.300,00:10:36.450
"to describe equilibrium, but
how to reach equilibrium.",00:10:36.450,00:10:40.540
"That is, I would like precisely
to answer the question, what",00:10:40.540,00:10:45.520
"happens if you start in a
situation where all of the gas",00:10:45.520,00:10:49.670
"is initially in one
half of the room?",00:10:49.670,00:10:53.650

is a partition,",00:10:53.650,00:10:55.920
"that's a well-defined
macroscopic state.",00:10:55.920,00:10:59.170
And then I remove the partition.,00:10:59.170,00:11:01.930
"And suddenly, it is a
non-equilibrium state.",00:11:01.930,00:11:05.050
"And presumably, over time,
this gas will occupy that.",00:11:05.050,00:11:10.620
"So there is a physical process
that we know happens in nature.",00:11:10.620,00:11:16.200
"And what I would
like eventually to do",00:11:16.200,00:11:19.030
"is to also describe
that physical process.",00:11:19.030,00:11:22.660

is I will start",00:11:22.660,00:11:24.690
"with the initial
configuration with everybody",00:11:24.690,00:11:28.300
in the half space.,00:11:28.300,00:11:30.400

the ensemble",00:11:30.400,00:11:33.360
that corresponds to that.,00:11:33.360,00:11:35.400
And that's unique.,00:11:35.400,00:11:37.270
Then I remove the partition.,00:11:37.270,00:11:39.670
"Then each member of the ensemble
will follow some trajectory",00:11:39.670,00:11:44.690
"as it occupies eventually
the entire box.",00:11:44.690,00:11:48.010
"And we would like to follow
how that evolution takes place",00:11:48.010,00:11:52.020

you will always have,",00:11:52.020,00:11:55.720

many different micro states",00:12:30.610,00:12:39.020

same macro state?",00:12:39.020,00:12:40.562

are already then talking",00:12:40.562,00:12:42.520

which description",00:12:45.018,00:12:48.120
"do you use as the first one
to generate the second one?",00:12:48.120,00:12:51.720

let's do-- [INAUDIBLE]",00:12:51.720,00:12:55.967

PROFESSOR: OK.,00:13:03.765,00:13:04.650
"I know that the way that
I'm presenting things",00:13:04.650,00:13:09.360
"will lead ultimately to a useful
description of this procedure.",00:13:09.360,00:13:14.980
"You are welcome
to try to come up",00:13:14.980,00:13:16.720
with a different prescription.,00:13:16.720,00:13:18.710
"But the thing that I want
to ensure that you agree",00:13:18.710,00:13:22.430
"is that the procedure
that I'm describing here",00:13:22.430,00:13:26.710
has no logical inconsistencies.,00:13:26.710,00:13:30.120
I want to convince you of that.,00:13:30.120,00:13:32.450
"I am not saying that this
is necessarily the only one.",00:13:32.450,00:13:35.420
"As far as I know,
this is the only one",00:13:35.420,00:13:37.350
that people have worked with.,00:13:37.350,00:13:38.640
"But maybe somebody can come up
with a different prescription.",00:13:38.640,00:13:43.770
So maybe there is another one.,00:13:43.770,00:13:45.710
Maybe you can work on it.,00:13:45.710,00:13:47.430
"But I want you
to, at this point,",00:13:47.430,00:13:49.050
"be convinced that this is
a well-defined procedure.",00:13:49.050,00:13:51.440
OK?,00:13:56.180,00:13:58.550
"AUDIENCE: But because it's
a well-defined procedure,",00:13:58.550,00:14:01.646
"if you did exist
on another planet",00:14:01.646,00:14:03.986
"or in some universe where
the physics were different,",00:14:03.986,00:14:07.024
"the point is, you can use this.",00:14:07.024,00:14:08.619
"But can't you use this
for information in general",00:14:08.619,00:14:10.660
"when you want to-- like, if
you have-- the only requirement",00:14:10.660,00:14:14.220
"is that at a fine
scale, you have",00:14:14.220,00:14:18.370
"a consistent way of describing
things; and at a large scale,",00:14:18.370,00:14:21.640
"you have a way of making
sense of generalizing.",00:14:21.640,00:14:25.092
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:14:25.092,00:14:25.800
"AUDIENCE: So it's sort
of like a compression",00:14:25.800,00:14:28.070
"of data, or I use [INAUDIBLE].",00:14:28.070,00:14:31.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:14:31.420,00:14:33.200
"Except that part of this was
starting with some physics",00:14:33.200,00:14:38.040
that we know.,00:14:38.040,00:14:39.550
"So indeed, if you were
in a different universe--",00:14:39.550,00:14:42.980
"and later on in the course, we
will be in a different universe",00:14:42.980,00:14:46.013
"where the rules are
not classical or",00:14:46.013,00:14:47.512
quantum-mechanical.,00:14:47.512,00:14:48.303
"And you have to throw
away this description",00:14:50.289,00:14:52.080
of what a micro state is.,00:14:52.080,00:14:53.850
"And you can still go through
the entire procedure.",00:14:53.850,00:14:57.150
"But I want to do is to
follow these set of equations",00:14:57.150,00:15:00.250
"of motion and this
description of micro state,",00:15:00.250,00:15:02.610
and see where it leads us.,00:15:02.610,00:15:04.600
"And for the gas in this room, it
is a perfectly good description",00:15:04.600,00:15:08.220
of what's happened.,00:15:08.220,00:15:10.170
Yes?,00:15:10.170,00:15:10.670
"AUDIENCE: Maybe a
simpler question.",00:15:10.670,00:15:12.542
"Is big rho defined
only in spaces",00:15:12.542,00:15:15.023
where there are micro states?,00:15:15.023,00:15:17.327
"Like, is there anywhere where
there isn't a micro state?",00:15:17.327,00:15:19.660
"PROFESSOR: Yes, of course.",00:15:19.660,00:15:20.890
"So if I have--
thinking about a box,",00:15:20.890,00:15:23.420
"and if I ask what
is rho out here,",00:15:23.420,00:15:28.100
"I would say the
answer is rho is 0.",00:15:28.100,00:15:30.180
"But if you like, you can
say rho is defined only",00:15:30.180,00:15:33.270
within this space of the box.,00:15:33.270,00:15:35.170
"So the description
of the macro state",00:15:35.170,00:15:38.090
"which has something
to do with the box,",00:15:38.090,00:15:39.980
"over which I am
considering, will also",00:15:39.980,00:15:42.010
limit what I can describe.,00:15:42.010,00:15:45.280
Yes.,00:15:45.280,00:15:47.290
"And certainly, as far as if I
were to change p with velocity,",00:15:47.290,00:15:54.320
"let's say, then you
would say, a space",00:15:54.320,00:15:56.800
"where V is greater than speed
of light is not possible.",00:15:56.800,00:16:00.580
That's the point.,00:16:00.580,00:16:02.150
"So your rules of physics
will also define implicitly",00:16:02.150,00:16:06.580
"the domain over
which this is there.",00:16:06.580,00:16:10.270
"But that's all
part of mechanics.",00:16:10.270,00:16:12.590
"So I'm going to assume that
the mechanics part of it",00:16:12.590,00:16:14.980
is you are comfortable.,00:16:14.980,00:16:16.110
Yes?,00:16:16.110,00:16:17.452
"AUDIENCE: In your definition
of the ensemble average,",00:16:17.452,00:16:20.060
"are you integrating over all
6N dimensions of phase space?",00:16:20.060,00:16:23.790
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:16:23.790,00:16:24.530
"AUDIENCE: So why would your
average depend on p and q?",00:16:24.530,00:16:29.530
If you integrate?,00:16:32.480,00:16:33.300
"PROFESSOR: The average is
of a function of p and q.",00:16:33.300,00:16:36.600
"So in the same sense
that, let's say,",00:16:36.600,00:16:38.650
"I have a particle of
gas that is moving on,",00:16:38.650,00:16:41.520
"and I can write the
symbol, p squared over 2m,",00:16:41.520,00:16:45.070
what is this average?,00:16:45.070,00:16:47.100
"The answer will be KT
over 2, for example.",00:16:47.100,00:16:49.890
It will not depend on p.,00:16:49.890,00:16:51.380
"But the quantity that I'm
averaging inside the triangle",00:16:51.380,00:16:56.530
is a function of p and q.,00:16:56.530,00:16:58.580
Yes?,00:17:01.144,00:17:01.644
"AUDIENCE: So if it's an
integration, or basically",00:17:01.644,00:17:03.685
the--?,00:17:03.685,00:17:04.579
"PROFESSOR: The physical
limit of the problem.",00:17:04.579,00:17:06.970
AUDIENCE: Given a macro state?,00:17:06.970,00:17:10.281
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:17:10.281,00:17:13.130
"So typically, we
will be integrating q",00:17:13.130,00:17:16.430
"over the volume of a box,
and p from minus infinity",00:17:16.430,00:17:20.619
"to infinity,
because classically,",00:17:20.619,00:17:22.740
"without relativity,
this is a lot.",00:17:22.740,00:17:26.814
Yes?,00:17:26.814,00:17:27.314
AUDIENCE: Sorry.,00:17:27.314,00:17:28.103
"So why is the [INAUDIBLE] from
one end for every particle,",00:17:28.103,00:17:36.007
"instead of just
scattering space,",00:17:36.007,00:17:37.983
would you have a [INAUDIBLE]?,00:17:37.983,00:17:40.453
Or is that the same thing?,00:17:40.453,00:17:42.923
"PROFESSOR: I am not sure
I understand the question.",00:17:42.923,00:17:45.630
"So if I want to, let's say,
find out just one particle that",00:17:45.630,00:17:50.560
"is somewhere in this box, so
there is a probability that it",00:17:50.560,00:17:55.600
"is here, there is a
probability that it is there,",00:17:55.600,00:17:58.180
"there is a probability
that it is there.",00:17:58.180,00:18:00.930
"The integral of that probability
over the volume of the room",00:18:00.930,00:18:06.070
is one.,00:18:06.070,00:18:06.850
So how do I do that?,00:18:06.850,00:18:08.150
"I have to do an integral
over dx, dy, dz, probability",00:18:08.150,00:18:12.640
"as a function of x, y, and z.",00:18:12.640,00:18:14.690
Now I just repeat that 6N times.,00:18:14.690,00:18:16.590
OK?,00:18:20.890,00:18:21.390
All right.,00:18:25.390,00:18:26.020
So that's the description.,00:18:28.990,00:18:31.440
"But the first question
to sort of consider",00:18:31.440,00:18:35.660
"is, what is equilibrium
in this perspective?",00:18:35.660,00:18:44.940
"Now, we can even be
generous, although it's",00:18:55.730,00:19:00.100
"a very questionable thing,
to say that, really,",00:19:00.100,00:19:04.370
"when I sort of talk about the
kinetic energy of the gas,",00:19:04.370,00:19:08.320
"maybe I can replace that
by this ensemble average.",00:19:08.320,00:19:14.230
"Now, if I'm in
equilibrium, the results",00:19:14.230,00:19:17.240
"should not depend as
a function of time.",00:19:17.240,00:19:20.640
"So I expect that if
I'm calculating things",00:19:20.640,00:19:24.020
"in equilibrium, the result
of equations such as this",00:19:24.020,00:19:28.530
"should not depend on time,
which is actually a problem.",00:19:28.530,00:19:33.200
"Because we know that if I take
a picture of all of these things",00:19:33.200,00:19:39.740
"that I am constructing
my ensemble with",00:19:39.740,00:19:42.440
"and this picture is at
time t, at time t plus dt,",00:19:42.440,00:19:48.670
"all of the particles
have moved around.",00:19:48.670,00:19:51.420
"And so the point that was
here, the next instant of time",00:19:51.420,00:19:56.150
is going to be somewhere else.,00:19:56.150,00:19:58.020
"This is going to
be somewhere else.",00:19:58.020,00:19:59.670
"Each one of these is flowing
around as a function of time.",00:19:59.670,00:20:04.392
OK?,00:20:04.392,00:20:05.770
"So the picture that I
would like you to imagine",00:20:05.770,00:20:08.175
"is you have a box, and there's
a huge number of bees or flies",00:20:08.175,00:20:12.260
"or whatever your
preferred insect",00:20:12.260,00:20:14.615
"is, are just moving around.",00:20:14.615,00:20:17.010
OK?,00:20:17.010,00:20:18.860
"Now, you can sort of then
take pictures of this cluster.",00:20:18.860,00:20:22.610
"And it's changing potentially
as a function of time.",00:20:22.610,00:20:25.535
"And therefore, this
density should potentially",00:20:25.535,00:20:28.490
change as a function of time.,00:20:28.490,00:20:30.090
"And then this answer could
potentially depend on time.",00:20:33.510,00:20:38.590
"So let's figure out how
is this density changing",00:20:38.590,00:20:42.540
as a function of time.,00:20:42.540,00:20:44.762
"And hope that ultimately,
we can construct a solution",00:20:44.762,00:20:49.100
"for the equation that
governs the change in density",00:20:49.100,00:20:52.970
"as a function of time that
is in fact invariant in time.",00:20:52.970,00:20:58.700
"It is going back to my
flies or bees or whatever,",00:20:58.700,00:21:02.040
"you can imagine a
circumstance in which",00:21:02.040,00:21:04.330
"the bees are constantly
moving around.",00:21:04.330,00:21:07.710
"Each individual bee is now
here, then somewhere else.",00:21:07.710,00:21:12.020
"But all of your pictures have
the same density of bees,",00:21:12.020,00:21:15.810
"because for every bee
that left the box,",00:21:15.810,00:21:18.160
"there was another bee
that came in its place.",00:21:18.160,00:21:21.220
"So one can imagine
a kind of situation",00:21:21.220,00:21:24.290
"where all of these
points are moving around,",00:21:24.290,00:21:26.300
"yet the density
is left invariant.",00:21:26.300,00:21:29.730
"And in order to find whether
such a density is possible,",00:21:29.730,00:21:33.030
"we have to first know
what is the equation that",00:21:33.030,00:21:36.010
"governs the evolution
of that density.",00:21:36.010,00:21:38.494
"And that is given by the
Liouville's equation.",00:21:38.494,00:21:40.410
"So this governs evolution
of rho with time.",00:21:50.180,00:22:01.420
OK.,00:22:01.420,00:22:01.920
"So let's kind of blow off the
picture that we had over there.",00:22:07.430,00:22:12.060
"Previously, they're all
of these coordinates.",00:22:12.060,00:22:15.310
"There is some point
in coordinate space",00:22:15.310,00:22:20.260
that I am looking at.,00:22:20.260,00:22:22.140
"Let's say that the point
that I am looking at is here.",00:22:22.140,00:22:26.560
"And I have constructed
a box around it",00:22:26.560,00:22:30.480
"like this in the
6N-dimensional space.",00:22:30.480,00:22:35.510
"But just to be precise, I will
be looking at some particular",00:22:35.510,00:22:39.540
"coordinate q alpha and the
conjugate momentum p alpha.",00:22:39.540,00:22:45.280
"So this is my original
point corresponds to, say,",00:22:45.280,00:22:48.820
"some specific version
of q alpha p alpha.",00:22:48.820,00:22:53.620
"And that I have, in
this pair of dimensions,",00:22:53.620,00:22:59.260
"created a box that
in this direction",00:22:59.260,00:23:02.570
"has size dq alpha, in this
direction has size dp alpha.",00:23:02.570,00:23:09.110
OK?,00:23:09.110,00:23:11.420
"And this is the picture
that I have at some time t.",00:23:11.420,00:23:17.602
OK?,00:23:17.602,00:23:18.640
"Then I look at an instant of
time that is slightly later.",00:23:18.640,00:23:24.030
"So I go to a time
that is t plus dt.",00:23:24.030,00:23:29.360
"I find that the point that
I had initially over here",00:23:29.360,00:23:33.430
"as the center of this
box has moved around",00:23:33.430,00:23:37.350
"to some other
location that I will",00:23:37.350,00:23:39.890
"call q alpha prime,
p alpha prime.",00:23:39.890,00:23:42.610
"If you ask me what is q alpha
prime and p alpha prime,",00:23:45.560,00:23:48.700
"I say, OK, I know
that, because I",00:23:48.700,00:23:50.330
know with equations of motion.,00:23:50.330,00:23:51.990
"If I was running
this on a computer,",00:23:51.990,00:23:54.220
"I would say that q alpha prime
is q alpha plus the velocity",00:23:54.220,00:24:03.090
"q alpha dot dt, plus
order of dt squared,",00:24:03.090,00:24:09.730
"which hopefully, I will choose
a sufficient and small time",00:24:09.730,00:24:12.480
interval I can ignore.,00:24:12.480,00:24:14.876
"And similarly, p
alpha prime would",00:24:14.876,00:24:19.580
"be p alpha plus p alpha
dot dt order of dt squared.",00:24:19.580,00:24:26.460
OK?,00:24:29.446,00:24:29.946
"So any point that was in
this box will also move.",00:24:35.440,00:24:39.885
"And presumably,
close-by points will",00:24:39.885,00:24:42.015
be moving to close-by points.,00:24:42.015,00:24:45.140
"And overall, anything
that was originally",00:24:45.140,00:24:47.200
"in this square actually
projected from a larger",00:24:47.200,00:24:52.210
"dimensional cube will be part
of a slightly distorted entity",00:24:52.210,00:24:57.830
here.,00:24:57.830,00:24:58.330
"So everything that was
here is now somewhere here.",00:24:58.330,00:25:03.421
OK?,00:25:03.421,00:25:06.410
"I can ask, well, how wide is
this new distance that I have?",00:25:06.410,00:25:14.850
"So originally, the two
endpoints of the square",00:25:14.850,00:25:19.120
were a distance dq alpha apart.,00:25:19.120,00:25:22.020
"Now they're going to be a
distance dq alpha prime apart.",00:25:22.020,00:25:26.430
What is dq alpha prime?,00:25:26.430,00:25:28.740
"I claim that dq alpha prime
is whatever I had originally,",00:25:28.740,00:25:40.220
"but then the two N's
are moving at slightly",00:25:40.220,00:25:43.930
"different velocities,
because the velocity depends",00:25:43.930,00:25:48.080
on where you are in phase space.,00:25:48.080,00:25:50.700
"And so the difference in
velocity between these two",00:25:50.700,00:25:53.590
"points is really the derivative
of the velocity with respect",00:25:53.590,00:26:01.900
"to the separation that I have
between those two points, which",00:26:01.900,00:26:06.880
is dq times dq alpha.,00:26:06.880,00:26:10.715
"And this is how
much I would have",00:26:13.950,00:26:16.490
expanded plus higher order.,00:26:16.490,00:26:18.910
"And I can apply the same thing
in the momentum direction.",00:26:21.694,00:26:25.010
"The new vertical
separation dp alpha prime",00:26:28.330,00:26:40.860
"is different from what
it was originally,",00:26:40.860,00:26:44.230
"because the two
endpoints got stretched.",00:26:44.230,00:26:47.710
"The reason they
got stretched was",00:26:47.710,00:26:49.330
"because their velocities
were different.",00:26:49.330,00:26:53.210
"And their difference
is just the derivative",00:26:53.210,00:26:55.270
"of velocity with
respect to separation",00:26:55.270,00:26:57.640
times their small separation.,00:26:57.640,00:26:59.800
"And if I make
everything small, I",00:26:59.800,00:27:02.650
"can, in principle, write
higher order terms.",00:27:02.650,00:27:05.092
"But I don't have to
worry about that.",00:27:05.092,00:27:06.633
OK?,00:27:13.378,00:27:13.878
"So I can ask, what is the area
of this slightly distorted",00:27:16.790,00:27:24.940
square?,00:27:24.940,00:27:26.440
"As long as the dt is
sufficiently small,",00:27:26.440,00:27:30.680
"all of the distortions, et
cetera, will be small enough.",00:27:30.680,00:27:34.010
"And you can convince
yourself of this.",00:27:34.010,00:27:37.930
"And what you will find
is that the product",00:27:37.930,00:27:41.530
"of dq alpha prime,
dp alpha prime,",00:27:41.530,00:27:46.250
"if I were to multiply
these things,",00:27:46.250,00:27:48.580
"you can see that dq
alpha and dp alpha",00:27:48.580,00:27:51.340
is common to the two of them.,00:27:51.340,00:27:53.125
"So I have dq alpha, dp alpha.",00:27:53.125,00:27:57.200
"From multiplying these
two terms, I will get one.",00:27:57.200,00:28:01.620
"And then I will get two
terms that are order of dt,",00:28:01.620,00:28:06.610
"that I will get from dq alpha
dot with respect to dq alpha,",00:28:06.610,00:28:15.682
"plus dp alpha dot with
respect to dp alpha.",00:28:15.682,00:28:19.750
"And then there will be terms
that are order of dt squared",00:28:19.750,00:28:23.900
"and higher order
types of things.",00:28:23.900,00:28:25.562
OK?,00:28:28.640,00:28:29.140
"So the distortion in the
area of this particle,",00:28:32.090,00:28:38.680
"or cross section, is
governed by something",00:28:38.680,00:28:44.410
that is proportional to dt.,00:28:44.410,00:28:46.680
"And dq alpha dot over dq alpha
plus dp alpha dot dp alpha.",00:28:46.680,00:28:53.170
"But I have formally here for
what P i dot and qi dot are.",00:28:53.170,00:29:02.060
"So this is the dot notation
for the time derivative",00:29:02.060,00:29:06.460
"other than the one that
I was using before.",00:29:06.460,00:29:08.580
"So q alpha dot, what
do I have for it?",00:29:08.580,00:29:11.435
It is dh by dp alpha.,00:29:11.435,00:29:14.490
"So this is d by dq alpha
of the H by dp alpha.",00:29:14.490,00:29:20.205
"Whereas p alpha dot, from which
I have to evaluate d by dp",00:29:22.880,00:29:28.620
"alpha, p alpha dot is
minus dH by dq alpha.",00:29:28.620,00:29:35.780
So what do I have?,00:29:35.780,00:29:37.620
"I have two second derivatives
that appear with opposite sign",00:29:37.620,00:29:43.360
and hence cancel each other out.,00:29:43.360,00:29:45.285
OK?,00:29:49.085,00:29:50.520
"So essentially, what we find
is that the volume element",00:29:50.520,00:29:57.190
is preserved under this process.,00:29:57.190,00:30:01.590
"And I can apply this to
all of my directions.",00:30:01.590,00:30:05.970
"And hence, conclude that
the initial volume that",00:30:11.240,00:30:18.050
"was surrounding my point
is going to be preserved.",00:30:18.050,00:30:24.039
OK?,00:30:24.039,00:30:24.538
"So what that means is that these
classical equations of motion,",00:30:27.820,00:30:34.200
"the Hamiltonian equations, for
this description of micro state",00:30:34.200,00:30:40.030
"that involves the
coordinates and momenta",00:30:40.030,00:30:43.410

that they preserve volume",00:30:43.410,00:30:47.330
"of phase space as
they move around.",00:30:47.330,00:30:50.071
Yes?,00:30:50.071,00:30:50.570
"AUDIENCE: If the Hamiltonian has
expontential time dependence,",00:30:50.570,00:30:53.741
that doesn't work anymore.,00:30:53.741,00:30:55.100
PROFESSOR: No.,00:30:55.100,00:30:55.710
"So that's why I did not
put that over there.",00:30:55.710,00:30:58.459
Yes.,00:30:58.459,00:30:58.959
"And actually, this is
sometimes referred to",00:31:06.070,00:31:10.840
"as being something like
an incompressible fluid.",00:31:10.840,00:31:14.980
"Because if you kind of deliver
hydrodynamics for something",00:31:24.770,00:31:31.680
"like water if you regard
it as incompressible,",00:31:31.680,00:31:34.910
"the velocity field
has the condition",00:31:34.910,00:31:37.810
"that the divergence
of the velocity is 0.",00:31:37.810,00:31:42.050

"field that is composed of q
alpha dot and p alpha dot.",00:31:46.440,00:31:51.790
"And this being 0 is
really the same thing",00:31:51.790,00:31:55.170
"as the divergence in this
6N-dimensional space is 0.",00:31:55.170,00:32:00.190
"And that's a property of
the Hamiltonian dynamics",00:32:00.190,00:32:04.230
that one has.,00:32:04.230,00:32:04.960
Yes?,00:32:07.540,00:32:08.040
"AUDIENCE: Could
you briefly go over",00:32:08.040,00:32:09.960
"why you have to divide
by the separation",00:32:09.960,00:32:15.240
"when you expand the times
between the displacement?",00:32:15.240,00:32:20.126

multiply by the separation?",00:32:20.126,00:32:23.620

PROFESSOR: Where do I divide?,00:32:24.991,00:32:28.280
AUDIENCE: dq alpha by--,00:32:28.280,00:32:30.420
"PROFESSOR: Oh, this.",00:32:30.420,00:32:32.180
"Why do I have to
take a derivative.",00:32:32.180,00:32:35.804
So I have two points here.,00:32:35.804,00:32:39.740
"All of my points
are moving in time.",00:32:39.740,00:32:43.060
"So if these things were
moving with uniform velocity,",00:32:43.060,00:32:47.200
"one second later, this
would have moved here,",00:32:47.200,00:32:50.360
"this would have moved
the same distance,",00:32:50.360,00:32:52.620
"so that the separation
between them",00:32:52.620,00:32:54.470
"would have been
maintained if they",00:32:54.470,00:32:56.640
"were moving with
the same velocity.",00:32:56.640,00:32:59.070
"So if you are following
somebody and you",00:32:59.070,00:33:00.935
"are moving with the
same velocity as them,",00:33:00.935,00:33:03.650
"thus, your separation
does not change.",00:33:03.650,00:33:06.210
"But if one of you is going
faster than the other one,",00:33:06.210,00:33:11.500
"then the difference
in velocity will",00:33:11.500,00:33:14.750
determine how you separate.,00:33:14.750,00:33:17.400
"And what is the
difference in velocity?",00:33:17.400,00:33:20.390
"The difference in velocity
depends, in this case,",00:33:20.390,00:33:23.200
to how far apart the points are.,00:33:23.200,00:33:26.210
"So the difference between
velocity here and velocity",00:33:26.210,00:33:29.300
"here is the
derivative of velocity",00:33:29.300,00:33:32.530
"as a function of
this coordinate.",00:33:32.530,00:33:34.900
"Derivative of velocity as a
function of that coordinate",00:33:34.900,00:33:38.560
multiplied by the separation.,00:33:38.560,00:33:40.145
OK?,00:33:50.520,00:33:52.530
"So what does this
incompressibility condition",00:33:52.530,00:33:54.960
mean?,00:33:54.960,00:33:56.250
"It means that however many
points I had over here,",00:33:56.250,00:34:01.310
"they end up in a box that has
exactly the same volume, which",00:34:01.310,00:34:06.990
"means that the density is going
to be the same around here",00:34:06.990,00:34:13.040
and around this new point.,00:34:13.040,00:34:16.050
"So essentially, what we have is
that the rho at the new point,",00:34:16.050,00:34:25.420
"p prime, q prime, and
time, t, plus dt, is",00:34:25.420,00:34:32.630
"the same thing as the rho at
the old point, p, q, at time, t.",00:34:32.630,00:34:41.670
"Again, this is the
incompressibility condition.",00:34:41.670,00:34:46.310
Now we do mathematics.,00:34:46.310,00:34:47.234
So let's write it again.,00:34:51.690,00:34:53.510
"So I've said, in other
words, that rho p, q, t",00:34:53.510,00:34:59.380
"is the same as the
rho at the new point.",00:34:59.380,00:35:02.510
"What's the momentum
at the new point?",00:35:02.510,00:35:05.270
It is p plus.,00:35:05.270,00:35:10.180
"For each component, it is
p alpha plus p alpha dot.",00:35:10.180,00:35:16.330
"Let's put it this
way. p plus p dot",00:35:16.330,00:35:19.810
"dt, q plus q dot
dt, and t plus dt.",00:35:19.810,00:35:30.118
"That is, if I look at
the new location compared",00:35:30.118,00:35:35.440
"to the old location, the time
changed, the position changed,",00:35:35.440,00:35:40.040
the momentum changed.,00:35:40.040,00:35:42.870
"They all changed--
in each arguments",00:35:42.870,00:35:45.810
"changed infinitesimally
by an amount that",00:35:45.810,00:35:47.880
is proportional to dt.,00:35:47.880,00:35:50.660
"And so what I can do is I
can expand this function",00:35:50.660,00:35:54.320
to order of dt.,00:35:54.320,00:35:56.320
"So I have rho at
the original point.",00:35:56.320,00:36:01.390
So this is all mathematics.,00:36:01.390,00:36:03.590
"I just look at
variation with respect",00:36:03.590,00:36:06.310
to each one of these arguments.,00:36:06.310,00:36:07.930
"So I have a sum
over alpha, p alpha",00:36:07.930,00:36:12.470
"dot d rho by dp
alpha plus q alpha",00:36:12.470,00:36:20.910
"dot d rho by dq alpha plus
the explicit derivative,",00:36:20.910,00:36:28.720
d rho by dt.,00:36:28.720,00:36:30.400
"This entirety is going
to be multiplied by dt.",00:36:30.400,00:36:35.050
"And then, in principle,
the expansion",00:36:35.050,00:36:37.760
would have higher order terms.,00:36:37.760,00:36:39.574
OK?,00:36:43.350,00:36:45.260
"Now, of course, the
first term vanishes.",00:36:45.260,00:36:48.242
It is the same on both times.,00:36:48.242,00:36:51.050
"So the thing that I
will have to set to 0",00:36:51.050,00:36:53.780
is this entity over here.,00:36:53.780,00:36:55.510
"Now, quite generally, if
you have a function of p,",00:36:58.270,00:37:05.785
"q, and t, you evaluate
it at the old point",00:37:05.785,00:37:11.710
"and then evaluate
at the new point.",00:37:11.710,00:37:14.860
"One can define what is
called a total derivative.",00:37:14.860,00:37:21.110
"And just like here,
the total derivative",00:37:21.110,00:37:24.640
"will come from variations
of all of these arguments.",00:37:24.640,00:37:28.000
"We'll have a partial
derivative with respect",00:37:28.000,00:37:30.470
"to time and partial
derivatives with respect",00:37:30.470,00:37:33.970
to any of the other arguments.,00:37:33.970,00:37:35.395
"So I wrote this to sort
of make a distinction",00:37:46.940,00:37:50.320
"between the symbol
that is commonly used,",00:37:50.320,00:37:53.950
"sometimes d by dt, which is
straight, sometimes Df by Dt.",00:37:53.950,00:37:58.360
"And this is either
a total derivative",00:38:02.620,00:38:09.120
or a streamline derivative.,00:38:09.120,00:38:13.470
"That is, you are
taking derivatives",00:38:13.470,00:38:16.580
"as you are moving
along with the flow.",00:38:16.580,00:38:20.560
"And that is to be distinguished
from these partial derivatives,",00:38:20.560,00:38:25.860
"which is really sitting
at some point in space",00:38:25.860,00:38:29.650
"and following how, from one
time instant to another time",00:38:29.650,00:38:33.360
"instant, let's say
the density changes.",00:38:33.360,00:38:36.930
"So Df by Dt with
a partial really",00:38:36.930,00:38:40.190
means sit at the same point.,00:38:40.190,00:38:43.240
"Whereas this big Df by Dt
means, go along with the flow",00:38:43.240,00:38:48.060
and look at the changes.,00:38:48.060,00:38:50.880
"Now, what we have established
here is that for the density,",00:38:50.880,00:38:56.955
"the density has some
special character because",00:38:56.955,00:38:59.990
"of this Liouville's theorem,
that the streamlined derivative",00:38:59.990,00:39:03.125
is 0.,00:39:03.125,00:39:04.500
"So what we have is
that d rho by dt is 0.",00:39:04.500,00:39:09.330
"And this d rho by dt
I can also write down",00:39:11.990,00:39:16.530
"as d rho by dt plus sum
over all 6N directions, d",00:39:16.530,00:39:25.445
rho by dp alpha.,00:39:25.445,00:39:28.550
"But then I substitute for
p alpha dot from here.",00:39:28.550,00:39:34.870
p dot is minus dH by dq.,00:39:34.870,00:39:36.880
"And then I add d
rho by dq alpha.",00:39:44.010,00:39:49.460
q alpha dot is dH by dp r.,00:39:49.460,00:39:52.740
OK?,00:39:56.556,00:39:57.056
"So then I can take this
combination with the minus sign",00:40:01.120,00:40:07.110
"to the other side and
write it as d rho by dt",00:40:07.110,00:40:14.520
"is something that I will
call the Poisson bracket of H",00:40:14.520,00:40:20.780

q, the second one with respect",00:40:44.710,00:40:49.740
to p.,00:40:49.740,00:40:51.100
"And then the whole thing
with the opposite sign.",00:40:51.100,00:40:55.190
"dA, dP, dB, dq.",00:40:55.190,00:40:58.950
So this is the Poisson bracket.,00:41:03.270,00:41:04.895
"And again, from
the definition, you",00:41:10.450,00:41:12.110
"should be able to
see immediately",00:41:12.110,00:41:14.540
"that Poisson bracket
of A and B is",00:41:14.540,00:41:16.870
"minus the Poisson
bracket of B and A. OK?",00:41:16.870,00:41:24.279
"Again, we ask the question
that in general, I",00:42:01.440,00:42:06.290
"can construct in principle
a rho of p, q, let's say,",00:42:06.290,00:42:14.410
for an equilibrium ensemble.,00:42:14.410,00:42:16.280
"But then I did something,
like I removed a partition",00:42:16.280,00:42:20.780
"in the middle of the gas,
and the gas is expanding.",00:42:20.780,00:42:23.940
"And then presumably, this
becomes a function of time.",00:42:23.940,00:42:28.980
"And since I know exactly how
each one of the particles,",00:42:28.980,00:42:33.810
"and hence each one
of the micro states",00:42:33.810,00:42:35.680
"is evolving as a
function of time,",00:42:35.680,00:42:37.740
"I should be able to tell how
this density in phase space",00:42:37.740,00:42:41.200
is changing.,00:42:41.200,00:42:42.430
"So this perspective is,
again, this perspective",00:42:42.430,00:42:46.970
"of looking at all of these
bees that are buzzing around",00:42:46.970,00:42:50.100
"in this 6N-dimensional space,
and asking the question, if I",00:42:50.100,00:42:54.190
"look at the particular point in
this 6N-dimensional space, what",00:42:54.190,00:42:58.350
is the density of bees?,00:42:58.350,00:43:00.600
"And the answer is
that it is given",00:43:00.600,00:43:03.890
"by the Poisson bracket
of the Hamiltonian",00:43:03.890,00:43:08.820
"that governs the evolution
of each micro state",00:43:08.820,00:43:11.709
and the density function.,00:43:11.709,00:43:12.750
All right.,00:43:20.940,00:43:21.470
So what does it mean?,00:43:21.470,00:43:23.880
What can we do with this?,00:43:23.880,00:43:25.320
"Let's play around with it and
look at some consequences.",00:43:29.520,00:43:32.170
"But before that, does
anybody have any questions?",00:43:37.870,00:43:43.402
OK.,00:43:43.402,00:43:44.840
All right.,00:43:44.840,00:43:45.340
"We had something
that I just erased.",00:43:49.350,00:43:51.300
"That is, if I have a
function of p and q,",00:43:51.300,00:43:55.730
"let's say it's not
a function of time.",00:43:55.730,00:43:58.210
"Let's say it's the kinetic
energy for this system where,",00:43:58.210,00:44:01.360
"at t equals to 0, I
remove the partition,",00:44:01.360,00:44:04.290
and the particles are expanding.,00:44:04.290,00:44:06.280
"And let's say the other
place you have a potential,",00:44:06.280,00:44:08.462
"so your kinetic energy on
average is going to change.",00:44:08.462,00:44:11.600
"You want to know what's
happening to that.",00:44:11.600,00:44:14.380
"So you calculate at
each instant of time",00:44:14.380,00:44:17.980
"an ensemble average
of the kinetic energy",00:44:17.980,00:44:21.380
"or any other quantity that
is interesting to you.",00:44:21.380,00:44:24.340
"And your prescription for
calculating an ensemble average",00:44:24.340,00:44:29.460
"is that you integrate against
the density the function",00:44:29.460,00:44:36.440
"that you are
proposing to look at.",00:44:36.440,00:44:42.260
"Now, in principle,
we said that there",00:44:42.260,00:44:45.580
"could be situations where
this is dependent on time,",00:44:45.580,00:44:48.620
"in which case, your average
will also depend on time.",00:44:48.620,00:44:53.040
"And maybe you want to know how
this time dependence occurs.",00:44:53.040,00:44:57.130
"How does the kinetic
energy of a gas that",00:44:57.130,00:44:59.720
"is expanding into some
potential change on average?",00:44:59.720,00:45:04.100
OK.,00:45:04.100,00:45:04.600
So let's take a look.,00:45:04.600,00:45:05.810
"This is a function of
time, because, as we said,",00:45:05.810,00:45:07.990
these go inside the average.,00:45:07.990,00:45:09.220
"So really, the only explicit
variable that we have here",00:45:09.220,00:45:12.710
is time.,00:45:12.710,00:45:13.680
"And you can ask,
what is the time",00:45:13.680,00:45:15.430
dependence of this quantity?,00:45:15.430,00:45:16.765
OK?,00:45:22.000,00:45:24.480
"So the time dependence is
obtained by doing this,",00:45:24.480,00:45:35.380
"because essentially, you
would be adding things",00:45:35.380,00:45:39.950
"at different points in p, q.",00:45:39.950,00:45:43.210
"And at each point, there
is a time dependence.",00:45:43.210,00:45:45.830
"And you take the derivative
in time with respect",00:45:45.830,00:45:49.290
"to the contribution
of that point.",00:45:49.290,00:45:51.860
So we get something like this.,00:45:51.860,00:45:54.940
"Now you say, OK, I know
what d rho by dt is.",00:45:54.940,00:45:58.420
"So this is my integration
over all of the phase space.",00:45:58.420,00:46:05.080
"d rho by dt is this Poisson
bracket of H and rho.",00:46:05.080,00:46:09.400
And then I have O. OK?,00:46:09.400,00:46:14.400
Let's write this explicitly.,00:46:14.400,00:46:16.930
"This is an integral
over a whole bunch",00:46:16.930,00:46:19.340
of coordinates and momenta.,00:46:19.340,00:46:20.530
"There is, for the
Poisson bracket,",00:46:26.340,00:46:30.725
a sum over derivatives.,00:46:30.725,00:46:32.690
"So I have a sum over
alpha-- dH by dq alpha,",00:46:32.690,00:46:39.390
"d rho by dp alpha minus dH by
dp alpha, d rho by dq alpha.",00:46:39.390,00:46:48.030
"And that Poisson
bracket in its entirety",00:46:48.030,00:46:50.970
"then gets multiplied by this
function of phase space.",00:46:50.970,00:46:57.210
OK.,00:46:57.210,00:47:00.080
"Now, one of the
mathematical manipulations",00:47:00.080,00:47:04.475
"that we will do a
lot in this class.",00:47:04.475,00:47:07.760
"And that's why I do this
particular step, although it's",00:47:07.760,00:47:11.160
"not really necessary to
the logical progression",00:47:11.160,00:47:13.795
"that I'm following,
is to remind you",00:47:13.795,00:47:17.470
"how you would do an integration
by parts when you're",00:47:17.470,00:47:21.260
faced with something like this.,00:47:21.260,00:47:23.290
"An integration by
parts is applicable",00:47:23.290,00:47:26.700
"when you have variables that you
are integrating that are also",00:47:26.700,00:47:31.660
appearing as derivatives.,00:47:31.660,00:47:35.340
"And whenever you are
integrating Poisson brackets,",00:47:35.340,00:47:39.740
"you will have derivatives
for the Poisson bracket.",00:47:39.740,00:47:43.130
"And the integration
would allow you",00:47:43.130,00:47:45.360
to use integration by parts.,00:47:45.360,00:47:48.530
"And in particular,
what I would like to do",00:47:48.530,00:47:52.130
"is to remove the derivative
that acts on the densities.",00:47:52.130,00:47:55.510
"So I'm going to
essentially rewrite that as",00:47:58.060,00:48:05.730
"minus an integral
that involves-- again.",00:48:05.730,00:48:11.090
"I don't want to keep
rewriting that thing.",00:48:11.090,00:48:14.190
"I want to basically take
the density out and then",00:48:14.190,00:48:20.340
"have the derivative, which is
this d by dp in the first term",00:48:20.340,00:48:24.070
"and d by dq in the second
term, act on everything else.",00:48:24.070,00:48:28.790
"So in the first case, d
by dp alpha will act on O",00:48:28.790,00:48:36.890
and dH by dq alpha.,00:48:36.890,00:48:38.540
"And in the second case, d
by dq alpha will act on O",00:48:41.150,00:48:48.260
and dH by dp alpha.,00:48:48.260,00:48:49.691
"Again, there is a sum over
alpha that is implicit.",00:48:53.459,00:48:57.000
OK?,00:48:59.916,00:49:01.380
"Again, there is a minus sign.",00:49:01.380,00:49:03.080
"So every time you do this
procedure, there is this.",00:49:03.080,00:49:07.230
"But every time, you also have
to worry about surface terms.",00:49:07.230,00:49:11.000
"So on the surface,
you would potentially",00:49:11.000,00:49:14.050
"have to evaluate things that
involve rho, O, and these d",00:49:14.050,00:49:19.850
by d derivatives.,00:49:19.850,00:49:21.305
"But let's say we are
integrating over momentum",00:49:25.020,00:49:28.290
from minus infinity to infinity.,00:49:28.290,00:49:30.650
"Then the density evaluated at
infinity momenta would be 0.",00:49:30.650,00:49:35.240
"So practicality, in all
cases that I can think of,",00:49:35.240,00:49:38.760
"you don't have to worry
about the boundary terms.",00:49:38.760,00:49:43.280
"So then when you look
at these kinds of terms,",00:49:43.280,00:49:47.200
"this d by dp alpha
can either act on O.",00:49:47.200,00:49:51.380
"So I will get dO by dp
alpha, dH by dq alpha.",00:49:51.380,00:49:58.000
Or it can act on dH by d alpha.,00:49:58.000,00:50:03.070
"So I will get plus O d2
H, dp alpha dq alpha.",00:50:03.070,00:50:08.530
"And similarly, in
this term, either I",00:50:08.530,00:50:11.950
"will have dO by dq alpha, dH by
dp alpha, or O d2 H, dq alpha",00:50:11.950,00:50:20.720
dp alpha.,00:50:20.720,00:50:23.740
"Once more, the second
derivative terms",00:50:23.740,00:50:25.770
"of the Hamiltonian, the
order is not important.",00:50:25.770,00:50:31.620
"And what is left
here is this set",00:50:31.620,00:50:34.600
"of objects, which is none
other than the Poisson bracket.",00:50:34.600,00:50:39.590
"So I can rewrite the whole thing
as d by dt of the expectation",00:50:39.590,00:50:44.440
"value of this quantity,
which potentially",00:50:44.440,00:50:47.630
"is a function of time
because of the time",00:50:47.630,00:50:49.860
"dependence of my density
is the same thing",00:50:49.860,00:50:53.410
"as minus an integration over
the entire phase space of rho",00:50:53.410,00:51:00.090
"against this entity,
which is none",00:51:00.090,00:51:03.170
"other than the Poisson
bracket of H with O.",00:51:03.170,00:51:09.200
"And this integration over
density of this entire space",00:51:09.200,00:51:13.830
"is just our definition
of the expectation value.",00:51:13.830,00:51:17.710
"So we get that the time
derivative of any quantity",00:51:17.710,00:51:27.650
"is related to the average
of its Poisson bracket",00:51:27.650,00:51:32.370
"with the Hamiltonian, which
is the quantity that is really",00:51:32.370,00:51:36.110
governing time dependences.,00:51:36.110,00:51:37.437
Yes?,00:51:40.913,00:51:41.413
"AUDIENCE: Could
you explain again",00:51:41.413,00:51:43.350
"why the time derivative
when N is the integral,",00:51:43.350,00:51:46.420
"it's rho as a
partial derivative?",00:51:46.420,00:51:48.688
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:51:48.688,00:51:50.140
"So suppose I'm doing a
two-dimensional integral",00:51:50.140,00:51:53.190
over p and q.,00:51:53.190,00:51:56.060
"So I have some contribution
from each point in this p and q.",00:51:56.060,00:52:01.010
"And so my integral
is an integral dpdq,",00:52:01.010,00:52:05.220
"something evaluated
at each point in p,",00:52:05.220,00:52:08.770
"q that could potentially
depend on time.",00:52:08.770,00:52:12.420
Imagine that I discretize this.,00:52:12.420,00:52:14.600
"So I really-- if you
are more comfortable,",00:52:14.600,00:52:17.230
"you can think of this
as a limit of a sum.",00:52:17.230,00:52:20.310
So this is my integral.,00:52:20.310,00:52:23.170
"If I'm interested in the time
dependence of this quantity--",00:52:23.170,00:52:26.800
"and I really depends
only on time,",00:52:26.800,00:52:29.130
"because I integrated
over p and q.",00:52:29.130,00:52:32.290
"So if I'm interested
in something",00:52:32.290,00:52:34.970
"that is a sum of
various terms, each term",00:52:34.970,00:52:38.990
is a function of time.,00:52:38.990,00:52:41.760
"Where do I put the
time dependence?",00:52:41.760,00:52:43.880
"For each term in this sum, I
look at how it depends on time.",00:52:43.880,00:52:49.990
"I don't care on its points
to the left and to the right.",00:52:49.990,00:52:53.805
OK?,00:52:59.030,00:52:59.990

moving with the streamline.",00:52:59.990,00:53:04.420

with the streamline.",00:53:04.420,00:53:07.050

this two-dimensional space.",00:53:07.050,00:53:12.350

contribution at that point",00:53:12.350,00:53:15.730
that is time-dependent.,00:53:15.730,00:53:17.380
"And I take the derivative with
respect to time at that point.",00:53:17.380,00:53:20.580
Yes?,00:53:23.200,00:53:23.720
"AUDIENCE: Couldn't you say
that you have function O",00:53:23.720,00:53:27.672
"as just some
function of p and q,",00:53:27.672,00:53:30.636

of Poisson bracket,",00:53:37.291,00:53:38.957

Poisson bracket only",00:54:08.760,00:54:11.090

for averages, right?",00:54:11.090,00:54:14.402
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:54:14.402,00:54:15.360

of what we do with the sign?,00:54:47.390,00:54:48.670
"AUDIENCE: Or if you look not
at the average failure of O",00:54:48.670,00:54:53.230
"but at the value of O
and point, and take-- I",00:54:53.230,00:54:57.745
"guess it would be
streamline derivative of it.",00:54:57.745,00:55:01.050
"So that's assuming that you're
just like assigning value of O",00:55:01.050,00:55:07.214
"to each point, and making
power changes with time",00:55:07.214,00:55:10.570
"as this point moves
across the phase space.",00:55:10.570,00:55:13.076
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:55:13.076,00:55:13.810
"But you still have to do some
bit of derivatives, et cetera,",00:55:13.810,00:55:20.230
because--,00:55:20.230,00:55:21.652
"AUDIENCE: But if you know
that the volume of the",00:55:21.652,00:55:24.520
"in phase space is
conserved, then we basically",00:55:24.520,00:55:28.756
"don't care much
that the function",00:55:28.756,00:55:30.980
"O is any much different
from probability density.",00:55:30.980,00:55:34.340
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:55:34.340,00:55:35.080
"If I understand correctly,
this is what you are saying.",00:55:35.080,00:55:38.070
"Is that for each
representative point,",00:55:38.070,00:55:41.150
"I have an O alpha, which
is a function of time.",00:55:41.150,00:55:46.190
"And then you want to say
that the average of O",00:55:46.190,00:55:51.880
"is the same thing as the sum
over alpha of O alpha of t's",00:55:51.880,00:55:57.370
"divided by N,
something like this.",00:55:57.370,00:55:59.690
AUDIENCE: Eh.,00:55:59.690,00:56:02.150
"Uh, I want to first calculate
what does time derivative of O?",00:56:02.150,00:56:08.020
"O remains in a function
of time and q and p.",00:56:08.020,00:56:12.406
So I can calculate--,00:56:12.406,00:56:13.390
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:56:13.390,00:56:14.380
So this O alpha is a function of,00:56:14.380,00:56:20.834
AUDIENCE: So if I said--,00:56:20.834,00:56:22.176
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:56:22.176,00:56:22.800
OK.,00:56:22.800,00:56:23.140
Fine.,00:56:23.140,00:56:23.640
"AUDIENCE: O is a function
of q and p and t,",00:56:23.640,00:56:27.292
"and I take a streamline
derivative of it.",00:56:27.292,00:56:29.890

"And then I average that
thing over phase space.",00:56:31.616,00:56:37.500

the same version--",00:56:37.500,00:56:39.994

But--,00:56:42.185,00:56:43.035
"PROFESSOR: Very quickly,
I don't think so.",00:56:43.035,00:56:46.890
"Because you are already
explaining things a bit",00:56:46.890,00:56:49.150
"longer than I think I went
through my derivation.",00:56:49.150,00:56:51.455

AUDIENCE: Is there any special--,00:56:55.004,00:56:57.290
"PROFESSOR: But I
agree in spirit, yes.",00:56:57.290,00:56:59.600
"That each one of these will
go along its streamline,",00:56:59.600,00:57:02.920
"and you can calculate the
change for each one of them.",00:57:02.920,00:57:06.280

average of this variety.",00:57:06.280,00:57:08.810
Yes.,00:57:08.810,00:57:09.705

you talk about time derivative",00:57:09.705,00:57:15.254
"of probability density, it's
Poisson bracket of H and rho.",00:57:15.254,00:57:19.300
"But when you talk about
time derivative of average,",00:57:19.300,00:57:23.156
you have to add the minus sign.,00:57:23.156,00:57:27.330
"PROFESSOR: And if you
do this correctly here,",00:57:27.330,00:57:29.840
you should get the same result.,00:57:29.840,00:57:31.134

"AUDIENCE: Well, along
that line, though,",00:57:35.945,00:57:39.005
"are you using the fact
that phase space volume is",00:57:39.005,00:57:43.455
"incompressible to then
argue that the total time",00:57:43.455,00:57:47.074
"derivative of the
ensemble average",00:57:47.074,00:57:49.900

"derivative of O, or not?",00:57:54.045,00:57:56.520
"PROFESSOR: Could
you repeat that?",00:58:08.326,00:58:09.700
"Mathematically,
you want me to show",00:58:09.700,00:58:11.810
"that the time derivative
of what quantity?",00:58:11.810,00:58:16.875
AUDIENCE: Of the average of O.,00:58:16.875,00:58:19.515
"PROFESSOR: Of the
average of O. Yes.",00:58:19.515,00:58:21.970
"AUDIENCE: Is it in any
way related to the average",00:58:21.970,00:58:24.370
of dO over dt?,00:58:24.370,00:58:27.065
"PROFESSOR: No, it's not.",00:58:27.065,00:58:29.520
"Because O-- I mean, so
what do you mean by that?",00:58:29.520,00:58:34.660
"You have to be careful, because
the way that I'm defining this",00:58:34.660,00:58:37.850
"here, O is a
function of p and q.",00:58:37.850,00:58:41.640
"And what you want to do
is to write something",00:58:41.640,00:58:46.250
"that is a sum over all
representative points, divided",00:58:46.250,00:58:56.990
"by the total number, some
kind of an average like this.",00:58:56.990,00:59:00.780

a time derivative here.",00:59:00.780,00:59:04.114
Is that what you are--,00:59:04.114,00:59:05.030
"AUDIENCE: Well, I
mean, I was thinking",00:59:05.030,00:59:06.710
"that even if you start out with
your observable being defined",00:59:06.710,00:59:10.230
"for every point in phase
space, then if you were to,",00:59:10.230,00:59:14.080
"before doing any
ensemble averaging,",00:59:14.080,00:59:16.150
"if you were to take the total
time derivative of that,",00:59:16.150,00:59:19.970
"then you would be accounted for
p dot and q dot as well, right?",00:59:19.970,00:59:25.030
"And then if you were
to take the ensemble",00:59:25.030,00:59:26.960
"average of that
quantity, could you",00:59:26.960,00:59:29.710
"arrive at the same
result for that?",00:59:29.710,00:59:31.420
"PROFESSOR: I'm pretty sure that
if you do things consistently,",00:59:31.420,00:59:34.570
yes.,00:59:34.570,00:59:35.320
"That is, what we have
done is essentially",00:59:35.320,00:59:37.230
"we started with a collection
of trajectories in phase space",00:59:37.230,00:59:41.830
"and recast the result in
terms of density and variables",00:59:41.830,00:59:45.235
"that are defined only as
positions in phase space.",00:59:45.235,00:59:49.950
"The two descriptions
completely are equivalent.",00:59:49.950,00:59:53.200
"And as long as one
doesn't make a mistake,",00:59:53.200,00:59:55.810
one can get one or the other.,00:59:55.810,00:59:58.022
"This is actually a kind
of a well-known thing",00:59:58.022,01:00:01.635
"in hydrodynamics, because
typically, you write down,",01:00:01.635,01:00:05.490
"in hydrodynamics, equations
for density and velocity",01:00:05.490,01:00:09.070
at each point in phase space.,01:00:09.070,01:00:11.850
"But there is an
alternative description",01:00:11.850,01:00:14.220
"which we can say that there's
essentially particles that are",01:00:14.220,01:00:18.400
flowing.,01:00:18.400,01:00:19.700
"And particle that was
here at this location",01:00:19.700,01:00:22.800
"is now somewhere else
at some later time.",01:00:22.800,01:00:25.860
And people have tried hard.,01:00:25.860,01:00:28.820
"And there is a
consistent definition",01:00:28.820,01:00:30.570
"of hydrodynamics that follows
the second perspective.",01:00:30.570,01:00:34.620
"But I haven't seen it
as being practical.",01:00:34.620,01:00:37.700
"So I'm sure that everything
that you guys say is correct.",01:00:37.700,01:00:41.440
"But from the experience of
what I know in hydrodynamics,",01:00:41.440,01:00:45.250
"I think this is the more
practical description",01:00:45.250,01:00:47.450
that people have been using.,01:00:47.450,01:00:49.090
OK?,01:00:53.170,01:00:56.060
So where were we?,01:00:56.060,01:00:58.810
OK.,01:00:58.810,01:00:59.310
So back to our buzzing bees.,01:01:01.920,01:01:05.810
"We now have a way
of looking at how",01:01:09.960,01:01:13.240
"densities and various quantities
that you can calculate,",01:01:13.240,01:01:17.070
"like ensemble averages, are
changing as a function of time.",01:01:17.070,01:01:22.670
"But the question
that I had before",01:01:22.670,01:01:24.145
"is, what about equilibrium?",01:01:24.145,01:01:25.270
"Because the thermodynamic
definition of equilibrium,",01:01:31.700,01:01:35.170
"and my whole ensemble idea,
was that essentially, I",01:01:35.170,01:01:38.550
"have all of these
boxes and pressure,",01:01:38.550,01:01:41.920
"volume, everything
that I can think of,",01:01:41.920,01:01:44.120
"as long as I'm not
doing something that's",01:01:44.120,01:01:46.510
"like opening the box, is
perfectly independent of time.",01:01:46.510,01:01:52.230
"So how can I ensure that
various things that I calculate",01:01:52.230,01:01:56.260
are independent of time?,01:01:56.260,01:01:58.170
"Clearly, I can do that by having
this density not really depend",01:01:58.170,01:02:03.640
on time.,01:02:03.640,01:02:05.950
OK?,01:02:05.950,01:02:07.830
"Now, of course, each
representative point",01:02:07.830,01:02:10.180
is moving around.,01:02:10.180,01:02:11.370
"Each micro state
is moving around.",01:02:11.370,01:02:13.210
Each bee is moving around.,01:02:13.210,01:02:14.710
"But I want the density that is
characteristic of equilibrium",01:02:14.710,01:02:21.100
"be something that does
not change in time.",01:02:21.100,01:02:23.340
It's 0.,01:02:26.030,01:02:26.560
"And so if I posit that this
particular function of p and q",01:02:29.220,01:02:34.830
"is something that is not
changing as a function of time,",01:02:34.830,01:02:38.150
"I have to require that
the Poisson bracket",01:02:38.150,01:02:40.900
"of that function of p and
q with the Hamiltonian,",01:02:40.900,01:02:44.310
"which is another function
of p and q, is 0.",01:02:44.310,01:02:48.435
OK?,01:02:48.435,01:02:49.330
"So in principle,
I have to go back",01:02:49.330,01:02:52.290
"to this equation over here,
which is a partial differential",01:02:52.290,01:02:57.000
"equation in 6N-dimensional
space and solve with equal to 0.",01:02:57.000,01:03:03.190
"Of course, rather than doing
that, we will guess the answer.",01:03:03.190,01:03:06.640
"And the guess is clear from
here, because all I need to do",01:03:06.640,01:03:12.390
"is to make rho equilibrium
depend on coordinates in phase",01:03:12.390,01:03:18.500
"space through some functional
dependence on Hamiltonian,",01:03:18.500,01:03:24.210
"which depends on the
coordinates in phase space.",01:03:24.210,01:03:28.354
OK?,01:03:28.354,01:03:29.820
Why does this work?,01:03:29.820,01:03:31.730
"Because then when I take the
Poisson bracket of, let's",01:03:31.730,01:03:36.580
"say, this function of H with
H, what do I have to do?",01:03:36.580,01:03:45.640
"I have to do a sum over
alpha d rho with respect",01:03:45.640,01:03:50.590
"to, let's say-- actually,
let's write it in this way.",01:03:50.590,01:03:55.510
"I will have the dH by
dp alpha from here.",01:03:55.510,01:04:02.850
"I have to multiply
by d rho by dq alpha.",01:04:02.850,01:04:06.770
"But rho is a function
of only H. So I",01:04:06.770,01:04:10.510
"have to take a derivative of rho
with respect to its argument H.",01:04:10.510,01:04:14.500
And I'll call that rho prime.,01:04:14.500,01:04:16.270
"And then the derivative
of the argument,",01:04:16.270,01:04:18.610
"which is H, with
respect to q alpha.",01:04:18.610,01:04:22.090
That would be the first term.,01:04:22.090,01:04:24.580
"The next term would be, with
the minus sign, from the H here,",01:04:24.580,01:04:29.755
"dH by dq alpha, the derivative
of rho with respect to p alpha.",01:04:29.755,01:04:37.520
"But rho only depends on H, so I
will get the derivative of rho",01:04:37.520,01:04:42.460
"with respect to
its one argument.",01:04:42.460,01:04:44.650
"The derivative of that argument
with respect to p alpha.",01:04:44.650,01:04:49.610
OK?,01:04:49.610,01:04:51.410
"So you can see that up to
the order of the terms that",01:04:51.410,01:04:54.470
"are multiplying here, this is 0.",01:04:54.470,01:04:59.020
OK?,01:04:59.020,01:05:02.020
"So any function I choose of H,
in principle, satisfies this.",01:05:02.020,01:05:10.650
"And this is what we
will use consistently",01:05:10.650,01:05:14.710
"all the time in
statistical mechanics,",01:05:14.710,01:05:17.680
"in depending on the
ensemble that we have.",01:05:17.680,01:05:20.560
"Like you probably
know that when we",01:05:20.560,01:05:22.275
"are in the micro
canonical ensemble,",01:05:22.275,01:05:25.000
"we look at-- in the
micro canonical ensemble,",01:05:25.000,01:05:28.110
we'd say what the energy is.,01:05:28.110,01:05:31.630
"And then we say
that the density is",01:05:31.630,01:05:35.620
"a delta function--
essentially zero.",01:05:35.620,01:05:41.100
"Except places, it's
the surface that",01:05:41.100,01:05:44.820
"corresponds to having
the right energy.",01:05:44.820,01:05:47.410
"So you sort of
construct in phase space",01:05:47.410,01:05:50.160
"the surface that has
the right energy.",01:05:50.160,01:05:53.100
"So it's a function
of these four.",01:05:53.100,01:05:56.889
So this is the micro canonical.,01:05:56.889,01:05:58.180
"When you are in the
canonical, I use",01:06:00.790,01:06:02.750
"a rho this is proportional
to e to the minus beta H",01:06:02.750,01:06:05.822
and other functional features.,01:06:05.822,01:06:07.610
"So it's, again, the same idea.",01:06:07.610,01:06:10.175
OK?,01:06:13.140,01:06:13.640
"That's almost but
not entirely true,",01:06:21.570,01:06:25.910
"because sometimes there are
also other conserved quantities.",01:06:25.910,01:06:29.894
"Let's say that, for example, we
have a collection of particles",01:06:39.640,01:06:43.620
"in space in a cavity that
has the shape of a sphere.",01:06:43.620,01:06:48.100
"Because of the symmetry
of the problem,",01:06:48.100,01:06:50.740
"angular momentum is going
to be a conserved quantity.",01:06:50.740,01:06:56.300
"Angular momentum
you can also write",01:06:56.300,01:06:58.570
"as some complicated
function of p and q.",01:06:58.570,01:07:02.030
"For example, p cross q summed
over all of the particles.",01:07:02.030,01:07:05.340
"But it could be some
other conserved quantity.",01:07:05.340,01:07:10.130
"So what does this
conservation law mean?",01:07:10.130,01:07:13.680
"It means that if you
evaluate L for some time,",01:07:13.680,01:07:20.410
"it is going to be the
same L for the coordinates",01:07:20.410,01:07:23.920
and momenta at some other time.,01:07:23.920,01:07:26.010
"Or in other words,
dL by dt, which",01:07:26.010,01:07:29.700
"you obtained by summing
over all coordinates dL",01:07:29.700,01:07:34.470
"by dp alpha, p alpha dot, plus
dL by dq alpha q alpha dot.",01:07:34.470,01:07:44.370
"Essentially, taking
time derivatives",01:07:44.370,01:07:46.440
of all of the arguments.,01:07:46.440,01:07:48.150
"And I did not put any
explicit time dependence here.",01:07:48.150,01:07:51.780
"And this is again sum
over alpha dL by dp alpha.",01:07:51.780,01:07:57.440
"p alpha dot is minus
dH by dq alpha.",01:07:57.440,01:08:04.670
"And dL by dq alpha, q alpha
dot is dH by dp alpha.",01:08:04.670,01:08:14.570
"So you are seeing that
this is the same thing",01:08:14.570,01:08:17.834
"as the Poisson
bracket of L and H.",01:08:17.834,01:08:24.540
"So essentially, conserved
quantities which",01:08:24.540,01:08:29.830
"are essentially functions
of coordinates and momenta",01:08:29.830,01:08:33.990
"that you calculate that don't
change as a function of time",01:08:33.990,01:08:37.680
"are also quantities
that have zero Poisson",01:08:37.680,01:08:40.420
brackets with the Hamiltonian.,01:08:40.420,01:08:43.700
"So if I have a
conserved quantity,",01:08:43.700,01:08:47.569
"then I have a more
general solution.",01:08:47.569,01:08:49.414
"To my d rho by dt
equals to 0 requirement.",01:08:55.890,01:09:02.140
"I could make a rho
equilibrium which",01:09:02.140,01:09:05.410
"is a function of H of p and q,
as well as, say, L of p and q.",01:09:05.410,01:09:10.563
"And when you go through the
Poisson bracket process,",01:09:14.649,01:09:20.979
"you will either be
taking derivatives",01:09:20.979,01:09:34.120
"with respect to the
first argument here.",01:09:34.120,01:09:37.870
"So you would get rho prime with
respect to the first argument.",01:09:37.870,01:09:43.319
"And then you would get the
Poisson bracket of H and H.",01:09:43.319,01:09:47.859
"Or you would be getting
derivatives with respect",01:09:47.859,01:09:50.810
to the second argument.,01:09:50.810,01:09:53.819
"And then you would be getting
the Poisson bracket of L and H.",01:09:53.819,01:09:59.280
And both of them are 0.,01:09:59.280,01:10:01.540
"By definition, L is
a conserved quantity.",01:10:01.540,01:10:04.850
"So any solution that's a
function of Hamiltonian,",01:10:04.850,01:10:10.440
"the energy of the
system is conserved",01:10:10.440,01:10:12.340
"as a function of
time, as well as",01:10:12.340,01:10:14.570
"any other conserved quantities,
such as angular momentum,",01:10:14.570,01:10:18.190
"et cetera, is certainly
a valid thing.",01:10:18.190,01:10:22.200
"So indeed, when I drew here, in
the micro canonical ensemble,",01:10:22.200,01:10:28.680
"a surface that corresponds
to a constant energy,",01:10:28.680,01:10:33.020
"well, if I am in a
spherical cavity,",01:10:33.020,01:10:36.450
"only part of that
surface that corresponds",01:10:36.450,01:10:39.270
"to the right angular momentum
is going to be accessible.",01:10:39.270,01:10:43.490
"So essentially, what I know
is that if I have conserved",01:10:43.490,01:10:48.870
"quantities, my trajectories
will explore the subspace",01:10:48.870,01:10:55.050
"that is consistent with
those conservation laws.",01:10:55.050,01:10:59.070
"And this statement here is that
ultimately, those spaces that",01:10:59.070,01:11:05.720
"correspond to the
appropriate conservation law",01:11:05.720,01:11:09.720
are equally populated.,01:11:09.720,01:11:11.750
Rho is constant around.,01:11:11.750,01:11:15.400
"So in some sense, we started
with the definition of rho",01:11:15.400,01:11:20.960
"by putting these points
around and calculating",01:11:20.960,01:11:24.460
"probability that way, which
was my objective definition",01:11:24.460,01:11:28.410
of probability.,01:11:28.410,01:11:30.100
"And through this
Liouville theorem,",01:11:30.100,01:11:32.320
"we have arrived
at something that",01:11:32.320,01:11:33.920
"is more consistent with
the subjective assignment",01:11:33.920,01:11:38.770
of probability.,01:11:38.770,01:11:40.040
"That is, the only
thing that I know,",01:11:40.040,01:11:42.790
"forgetting about
the dynamics, is",01:11:42.790,01:11:44.360
"that there are some
conserved quantities,",01:11:44.360,01:11:46.240
"such as H, angular
momentum, et cetera.",01:11:46.240,01:11:49.060
"And I say that any point in
phase space that does not",01:11:49.060,01:11:51.990
"violate those constants in this,
say, micro canonical ensemble",01:11:51.990,01:11:56.600
would be equally populated.,01:11:56.600,01:11:58.520
There was a question somewhere.,01:11:58.520,01:12:00.860
Yes?,01:12:00.860,01:12:02.314
"AUDIENCE: So I almost feel like
the statement that the rho has",01:12:02.314,01:12:11.324
"to not change in time is too
strong, because if you go over",01:12:11.324,01:12:15.967
"to the equation that
says the rate of change",01:12:15.967,01:12:20.458
"is observable is equal
to the integral that",01:12:20.458,01:12:24.574
"was with a Poisson
bracket of rho and H, then",01:12:24.574,01:12:28.795
"it means that for
any observable,",01:12:28.795,01:12:30.450
"it's constant in time, right?",01:12:30.450,01:12:33.138
PROFESSOR: Yes.,01:12:33.138,01:12:34.040
"AUDIENCE: So rho of q means
any observable we can think of,",01:12:34.040,01:12:38.330
"its function of p
and q is constant?",01:12:38.330,01:12:40.232
PROFESSOR: Yep.,01:12:40.232,01:12:42.640
Yep.,01:12:42.640,01:12:43.370
"Because-- and that's
the best thing that we",01:12:43.370,01:12:49.720
"can think of in terms
of-- because if there",01:12:49.720,01:12:53.730
"is some observable that
is time-dependent--",01:12:53.730,01:12:56.660
"let's say 99 observables
are time-independent,",01:12:56.660,01:12:59.655
"but one is time-dependent,
and you can measure that,",01:12:59.655,01:13:03.830
"would you say your
system is in equilibrium?",01:13:03.830,01:13:06.140
Probably not.,01:13:06.140,01:13:07.104
OK?,01:13:11.856,01:13:12.356
"AUDIENCE: It seemed
like the same method",01:13:12.356,01:13:14.022
"that you did to show that
the density is a function of",01:13:14.022,01:13:17.155
"[INAUDIBLE], or
[INAUDIBLE] that it's",01:13:17.155,01:13:20.850
"the function of any observable
that's a function of q.",01:13:20.850,01:13:27.860
Right?,01:13:27.860,01:13:28.360
PROFESSOR: Observables?,01:13:28.360,01:13:29.500
No.,01:13:29.500,01:13:30.530
"I mean, here, if
this answer is 0,",01:13:30.530,01:13:36.000
"it states something about
this quantity averaged.",01:13:36.000,01:13:39.580
"So if this quantity does not
change as a function of time,",01:13:39.580,01:13:43.720
"it is not a statement
that H and 0 is 0.",01:13:43.720,01:13:48.410
"A statement that H and O is 0
is different from its ensemble",01:13:48.410,01:13:52.700
average being 0.,01:13:52.700,01:13:55.330
"What you can show-- and I think
I have a problem set for that--",01:13:55.330,01:13:59.450
"is that if this statement
is correct for every O",01:13:59.450,01:14:04.280
"that the average
is 0, then your rho",01:14:04.280,01:14:08.870
"has to satisfy
this theorem equals",01:14:08.870,01:14:11.940
"to-- Poisson bracket of
rho and H is equal to 0.",01:14:11.940,01:14:15.992
OK.,01:14:23.860,01:14:24.420
"So now the big question
is the following.",01:14:24.420,01:14:28.030
"We arrived that the way of
thinking about equilibrium",01:14:28.030,01:14:31.390
"in a system of
particles and things",01:14:31.390,01:14:34.610
"that are this many-to-one
mapping, et cetera, in terms",01:14:34.610,01:14:38.000
"of the densities-- we arrived
that the definition of what",01:14:38.000,01:14:42.030
"the density is going
to be in equilibrium.",01:14:42.030,01:14:44.990
"But the thermodynamic statement
is much, much more severe.",01:14:44.990,01:14:49.730
"The statement, again,
is that if I have a box",01:14:49.730,01:14:52.770
"and I open the door
of the box, the gas",01:14:52.770,01:14:56.320
"expands to fill the empty space
or the other part of the box.",01:14:56.320,01:15:01.300
And it will do so all the time.,01:15:01.300,01:15:04.850
"Yet the equations of motion
that we have over here",01:15:04.850,01:15:07.790
are time reversal invariant.,01:15:07.790,01:15:10.090
"And we did not manage
to remove that.",01:15:10.090,01:15:12.710
"We can show that this
Liouville equation, et cetera,",01:15:12.710,01:15:15.920
is also time reversal invariant.,01:15:15.920,01:15:19.030
"So for every case,
if you succeed",01:15:19.030,01:15:21.340
"to show that there is a density
that is in half of the box",01:15:21.340,01:15:24.340
"and it expands to
fill the entire box,",01:15:24.340,01:15:27.610
"there will be a density that
presumably goes the other way.",01:15:27.610,01:15:30.940
"Because that will be also a
solution of this equation.",01:15:30.940,01:15:34.760
"So when we sort of go back
from the statement of what",01:15:34.760,01:15:39.430
"is the equilibrium
solution and ask,",01:15:39.430,01:15:42.670
"do I know that I will eventually
reach this equilibrium",01:15:42.670,01:15:46.720
"solution as a function of
time, we have not shown that.",01:15:46.720,01:15:50.210
"And we will attempt
to do so next time.",01:15:50.210,01:15:55.040
