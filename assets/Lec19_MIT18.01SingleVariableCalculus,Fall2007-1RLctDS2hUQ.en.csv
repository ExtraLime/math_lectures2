"PROFESSOR: Today we're going
to continue with integration.",00:00:21.864,00:00:24.280
"And we get to do the-- probably
the most important thing",00:00:24.280,00:00:29.670
of this entire course.,00:00:29.670,00:00:31.090
Which is appropriately named.,00:00:31.090,00:00:33.970
"It's called the fundamental
theorem of calculus.",00:00:33.970,00:00:50.250
"And we'll be abbreviating
it FTC and occasionally I'll",00:00:50.250,00:00:54.900
"put in a 1 here, because there
will be two versions of it.",00:00:54.900,00:00:58.964
"But this is the
one that you'll be",00:00:58.964,00:01:00.380
using the most in this class.,00:01:00.380,00:01:06.420
"The fundamental theorem of
calculus says the following.",00:01:06.420,00:01:14.540
"It says that if F' =
f, so F'(x) = f(x),",00:01:14.540,00:01:26.875
"there's a capital
F and a little f,",00:01:26.875,00:01:30.890
"then the integral from a to b
of f(x) is equal to F(b) - F(a).",00:01:30.890,00:01:45.960
That's it.,00:01:52.160,00:01:52.940
That's the whole theorem.,00:01:52.940,00:01:55.600
And you may recognize it.,00:01:55.600,00:02:00.120
"Before, we had the
notation that F",00:02:00.120,00:02:03.880
"was the antiderivative,
that is, capital F",00:02:03.880,00:02:10.020
was the integral of f(x).,00:02:10.020,00:02:11.635
We wrote it this way.,00:02:11.635,00:02:12.510
"This is this
indefinite integral.",00:02:12.510,00:02:14.860
"And now we're putting
in definite values.",00:02:14.860,00:02:17.970
"And we have a connection
between the two",00:02:17.970,00:02:20.260
uses of the integral sign.,00:02:20.260,00:02:22.420
"But with the definite
values, we get real numbers",00:02:22.420,00:02:24.530
out instead of a function.,00:02:24.530,00:02:26.220
Or a function up to a constant.,00:02:26.220,00:02:29.810
So this is it.,00:02:29.810,00:02:30.990
This is the formula.,00:02:30.990,00:02:32.120
"And it's usually also written
with another notation.",00:02:32.120,00:02:35.400
"So I want to introduce that
notation to you as well.",00:02:35.400,00:02:40.390
So there's a new notation here.,00:02:40.390,00:02:44.950
"Which you'll find
very convenient.",00:02:44.950,00:02:47.320
"Because we don't always
have to give a letter f",00:02:47.320,00:02:51.010
to the functions involved.,00:02:51.010,00:02:52.710
So it's an abbreviation.,00:02:52.710,00:02:54.930
"For right now there'll be
a lot of f's, but anyway.",00:02:54.930,00:02:57.610
So here's the abbreviation.,00:02:57.610,00:02:59.660
"Whenever I have a difference
between a function at two",00:02:59.660,00:03:04.420
"values, I also can
write this as F(x)",00:03:04.420,00:03:09.430
"with an a down here
and a b up there.",00:03:09.430,00:03:12.440
"So that's the
notation that we use.",00:03:12.440,00:03:16.550
"And you can also, for
emphasis, and this sometimes",00:03:16.550,00:03:19.910
"turns out to be important, when
there's more than one variable",00:03:19.910,00:03:23.450
floating around in the problem.,00:03:23.450,00:03:25.750
"To specify that
the variable is x.",00:03:25.750,00:03:28.200
"So this is the same
thing as x = a.",00:03:28.200,00:03:32.270
And x = b.,00:03:32.270,00:03:34.100
"It indicates where
you want to plug in,",00:03:34.100,00:03:36.040
what you want to plug in.,00:03:36.040,00:03:37.450
"And now you take the top
value minus the bottom value.",00:03:37.450,00:03:41.840
So F(b) - F(a).,00:03:41.840,00:03:43.380
"So this is just a notation, and
in that notation, of course,",00:03:43.380,00:03:50.290
"the theorem can be written
with this set of symbols here.",00:03:50.290,00:03:59.420
Equally well.,00:03:59.420,00:04:04.160
"So let's just give a
couple of examples.",00:04:04.160,00:04:06.250
"The first example
is the one that we",00:04:06.250,00:04:08.180
did last time very laboriously.,00:04:08.180,00:04:12.260
"If you take the function F(x),
which happens to be x^3 / 3,",00:04:12.260,00:04:19.370
"then if you differentiate
it, you get, well,",00:04:19.370,00:04:24.090
the the factor of 3 cancels.,00:04:24.090,00:04:25.870
"So you get x^2,
that's the derivative.",00:04:25.870,00:04:29.440
"And so by the
fundamental theorem,",00:04:29.440,00:04:32.760
"so this implies by the
fundamental theorem,",00:04:32.760,00:04:37.290
"that the integral from say, a to
b of x^3 over - sorry, x^2 dx,",00:04:37.290,00:04:47.140
that's the derivative here.,00:04:47.140,00:04:50.280
"This is the function we're
going to use as f(x) here -",00:04:50.280,00:04:55.620
"is equal to this function
here, F(b) - F(a), that's here.",00:04:55.620,00:05:02.530
This function here.,00:05:02.530,00:05:04.220
"So that's F(b) - F(a), and
that's equal to b^3 / 3 -",00:05:04.220,00:05:13.470
a^3 / 3.,00:05:13.470,00:05:19.480
"Now, in this new
notation, we usually",00:05:19.480,00:05:23.710
don't have all of these letters.,00:05:23.710,00:05:25.060
All we write is the following.,00:05:25.060,00:05:26.310
"We write the
integral from a to b,",00:05:26.310,00:05:27.970
"and I'm going to
do the case 0 to b,",00:05:27.970,00:05:29.470
"because that was the one that
we actually did last time.",00:05:29.470,00:05:31.803
So I'm going to set a = 0 here.,00:05:31.803,00:05:35.940
"And then, the problem we
were faced last time as this.",00:05:35.940,00:05:39.590
"And as I said we did
it very laboriously.",00:05:39.590,00:05:41.940
"But now you can see that we
can do it in ten seconds,",00:05:41.940,00:05:47.620
let's say.,00:05:47.620,00:05:48.280
"Well, the antiderivative
of this is x^3 / 3.",00:05:48.280,00:05:52.300
"I'm going to evaluate it
at 0 and at b and subtract.",00:05:52.300,00:05:55.750
"So that's going to
be b^3 / 3 - 0^3 / 3.",00:05:55.750,00:06:00.540
Which of course is b^3 / 3.,00:06:00.540,00:06:03.140
"And that's the end,
that's the answer.",00:06:03.140,00:06:06.010
"So this is a lot
faster than yesterday.",00:06:06.010,00:06:08.820
I hope you'll agree.,00:06:08.820,00:06:10.860
"And we can dispense with
those elaborate computations.",00:06:10.860,00:06:15.060
"Although there's a conceptual
reason, a very important one,",00:06:15.060,00:06:18.460
"for understanding the
procedure that we went through.",00:06:18.460,00:06:21.960
"Because eventually you're
going to be using integrals",00:06:21.960,00:06:26.829
"and these quick ways
of doing things,",00:06:26.829,00:06:28.370
"to solve problems like finding
the volumes of pyramids.",00:06:28.370,00:06:32.280
"In other words, we're going
to reverse the process.",00:06:32.280,00:06:34.700
"And so we need to understand
the connection between the two.",00:06:34.700,00:06:42.100
"I'm going to give a
couple more examples.",00:06:42.100,00:06:45.210
And then we'll go on.,00:06:45.210,00:06:47.280
"So the second
example would be one",00:06:47.280,00:06:49.700
"that would be quite difficult
to do by this Riemann sum",00:06:49.700,00:06:52.440
"technique that we
described yesterday.",00:06:52.440,00:06:55.310
Although it is possible.,00:06:55.310,00:06:57.100
"It uses much higher
mathematics to do it.",00:06:57.100,00:06:59.860
"And that is the area under one
hump of the sine curve, sin x.",00:06:59.860,00:07:16.360
"Let me just draw
a picture of that.",00:07:16.360,00:07:17.920
"The curve goes like this, and
we're talking about this area",00:07:17.920,00:07:20.990
here.,00:07:20.990,00:07:21.490
"It starts out at
0, it goes to pi.",00:07:21.490,00:07:24.370
That's one hump.,00:07:24.370,00:07:28.320
"And so the answer is, it's the
integral from 0 to pi of sin",00:07:28.320,00:07:33.710
x dx.,00:07:33.710,00:07:37.849
"And so I need to take the
antiderivative of that.",00:07:37.849,00:07:39.890
And that's -cos x.,00:07:39.890,00:07:42.970
"That's the thing whose
derivative is sin x.",00:07:42.970,00:07:46.650
Evaluating it at 0 and pi.,00:07:46.650,00:07:49.820
"Now, let's do this
one carefully.",00:07:49.820,00:07:52.070
"Because this is where I see
a lot of arithmetic mistakes.",00:07:52.070,00:07:55.300
"Even though this is the
easy part of the problem.",00:07:55.300,00:07:57.690
"It's hard to pay attention
and plug in the right numbers.",00:07:57.690,00:08:02.100
"And so, let's just pay
very close attention.",00:08:02.100,00:08:04.150
I'm plugging in pi.,00:08:04.150,00:08:05.530
That's -cos pi.,00:08:05.530,00:08:08.444
That's the first term.,00:08:08.444,00:08:09.360
"And then I'm
subtracting the value",00:08:09.360,00:08:12.240
"at the bottom, which is -cos 0.",00:08:12.240,00:08:19.980
"There are already five
opportunities for you",00:08:19.980,00:08:22.350
"to make a transcription
error or an arithmetic",00:08:22.350,00:08:24.680
mistake in what I just did.,00:08:24.680,00:08:26.740
And I've seen all five of them.,00:08:26.740,00:08:30.090
"So the next one is
that this is -(-1).",00:08:30.090,00:08:34.670
"Minus negative 1, if you like.",00:08:34.670,00:08:36.810
"And then this is minus,
and here's another -1.",00:08:36.810,00:08:41.270
So altogether we have 2.,00:08:41.270,00:08:44.250
So that's it.,00:08:44.250,00:08:44.920
That's the area.,00:08:44.920,00:08:46.810
"This area, which is hard
to guess, this is area 2.",00:08:46.810,00:09:02.960
"The third example
is maybe superfluous",00:09:02.960,00:09:06.020
but I'm going to say it anyway.,00:09:06.020,00:09:10.280
"We can take the integral,
say, from 0 to 1, of x^100.",00:09:10.280,00:09:17.740
"Any power, now, is
within our power.",00:09:17.740,00:09:21.260
So let's do it.,00:09:21.260,00:09:24.050
"So here we have the
antiderivative is x^101 / 101,",00:09:24.050,00:09:32.980
evaluated at 0 and 1.,00:09:32.980,00:09:36.550
And that is just 1 / 101.,00:09:36.550,00:09:42.050
That's that.,00:09:42.050,00:09:46.520
"So that's the
fundamental theorem.",00:09:46.520,00:09:49.770
"Now this, as I say,
harnesses a lot",00:09:49.770,00:09:53.670
"of what we've already learned,
all about antiderivatives.",00:09:53.670,00:09:58.110
"Now, I want to give you an
intuitive interpretation.",00:09:58.110,00:10:05.820
So let's try that.,00:10:05.820,00:10:10.120
"We'll talk about a proof
of the fundamental theorem",00:10:10.120,00:10:12.450
a little bit later.,00:10:12.450,00:10:14.170
It's not actually that hard.,00:10:14.170,00:10:16.210
"But we'll give an intuitive
reason, interpretation,",00:10:16.210,00:10:22.470
if you like.,00:10:22.470,00:10:28.040
Of the fundamental theorem.,00:10:28.040,00:10:37.670
"So this is going to
be one which is not",00:10:37.670,00:10:40.330
"related to area, but rather
to time and distance.",00:10:40.330,00:10:43.990
"So we'll consider x(t) is
your position at time t.",00:10:43.990,00:10:55.600
"And then x'(t), which is dx/dt,
is going to be what we know",00:10:55.600,00:11:04.020
as your speed.,00:11:04.020,00:11:12.230
"And then what the theorem is
telling us is the following.",00:11:12.230,00:11:18.150
"It's telling us the integral
from a to b of v(t) dt -",00:11:18.150,00:11:25.580
"so, reading the relationship
- is equal to x (b) - x(a).",00:11:25.580,00:11:31.040
"And so this is some
kind of cumulative sum",00:11:35.930,00:11:40.800
of your velocities.,00:11:40.800,00:11:45.110
"So let's interpret the
right-hand side first.",00:11:45.110,00:11:48.440
This is the distance traveled.,00:11:48.440,00:11:57.290
"And it's also what you
would read on your odometer.",00:11:57.290,00:12:03.030
"Right, from the beginning
to the end of the trip.",00:12:03.030,00:12:05.550
"That's what you would
read on your odometer.",00:12:05.550,00:12:07.540
"Whereas this is what you would
read on your speedometer.",00:12:07.540,00:12:19.500
So this is the interpretation.,00:12:19.500,00:12:23.210
"Now, I want to just
go one step further",00:12:23.210,00:12:25.540
"into this
interpretation, to make",00:12:25.540,00:12:27.160
"the connection with the Riemann
sums that we had yesterday.",00:12:27.160,00:12:32.890
"Because those are very
complicated to understand.",00:12:32.890,00:12:35.447
"And I want you to
understand them viscerally",00:12:35.447,00:12:37.280
on several different levels.,00:12:37.280,00:12:39.090
"Because that's how you'll
understand integration better.",00:12:39.090,00:12:43.280
"The first thing that
I want to imagine,",00:12:43.280,00:12:44.960
"so we're going to do a
thought experiment now,",00:12:44.960,00:12:46.876
"which is that you are
extremely obsessive.",00:12:46.876,00:12:50.090
"And you're driving
your car from time a",00:12:50.090,00:12:53.410
"to time b, place Q
to place R, whatever.",00:12:53.410,00:12:58.010
"And you check your
speedometer every second.",00:12:58.010,00:13:03.900
"OK, so you've read your
speedometer in the i-th second,",00:13:03.900,00:13:09.280
"and you've read that
you're going at this speed.",00:13:09.280,00:13:12.620
"Now, how far do you
go in that second?",00:13:12.620,00:13:16.790
"Well, the answer is
you go this speed",00:13:16.790,00:13:19.530
"times the time interval,
which in this case",00:13:19.530,00:13:22.290
we're imagining as 1 second.,00:13:22.290,00:13:24.950
All right?,00:13:24.950,00:13:25.940
So this is how far you went.,00:13:25.940,00:13:27.980
But this is the time interval.,00:13:27.980,00:13:29.230
"And this is the
distance traveled",00:13:29.230,00:13:37.070
"in that-- second number
i, in the i-th second.",00:13:37.070,00:13:46.210
"The distance traveled in
the i-th second, that's",00:13:46.210,00:13:48.210
a total distance you traveled.,00:13:48.210,00:13:49.640
"Now, what happens if you
go the whole distance?",00:13:49.640,00:13:53.240
"Well, you travel the sum
of all these distances.",00:13:53.240,00:13:56.860
"So it's some massive sum, where
n is some ridiculous number",00:13:56.860,00:14:00.470
of seconds.,00:14:00.470,00:14:01.730
"3600 seconds or
something like that.",00:14:01.730,00:14:04.250
Whatever it is.,00:14:04.250,00:14:05.070
"And that's going to turn out
to be very similar to what you",00:14:05.070,00:14:09.170
would read on your odometer.,00:14:09.170,00:14:11.770
"Because during that second,
you didn't change velocity",00:14:11.770,00:14:14.140
very much.,00:14:14.140,00:14:14.990
"So the approximation
that the speed at one",00:14:14.990,00:14:17.470
"time that you spotted it is
very similar to the speed",00:14:17.470,00:14:21.360
during the whole second.,00:14:21.360,00:14:22.790
It doesn't change that much.,00:14:22.790,00:14:24.430
"So this is a pretty
good approximation",00:14:24.430,00:14:26.250
to how far you traveled.,00:14:26.250,00:14:29.160
"And so the sum is a very
realistic approximation",00:14:29.160,00:14:33.280
to the entire integral.,00:14:33.280,00:14:34.810
Which is denoted this way.,00:14:34.810,00:14:37.664
"Which, by the
fundamental theorem,",00:14:37.664,00:14:39.080
is exactly how far you traveled.,00:14:39.080,00:14:43.370
So this is x(b) - x(a) Exactly.,00:14:43.370,00:14:49.760
The other one is approximate.,00:14:49.760,00:14:55.560
"OK, again this is
called a Riemann sum.",00:14:55.560,00:15:08.950
"All right, so that's the intro
to the fundamental theorem.",00:15:08.950,00:15:17.470
"And now what I need to do
is extend it just a bit.",00:15:17.470,00:15:23.900
"And the way I'm going to
extend it is the following.",00:15:23.900,00:15:29.170
"I'm going to do it on
this example first.",00:15:29.170,00:15:31.140
"And then we'll do
it more formally.",00:15:31.140,00:15:35.530
"So here's this example
where we went someplace.",00:15:35.530,00:15:39.200
"But now I just want to draw
you an additional picture here.",00:15:39.200,00:15:44.370
"Imagine I start here
and I go over to there",00:15:44.370,00:15:49.360
and then I come back.,00:15:49.360,00:15:54.650
"And maybe even I
do a round trip.",00:15:54.650,00:15:56.100
I come back to the same place.,00:15:56.100,00:15:58.090
"Well, if I come back
to the same place,",00:15:58.090,00:16:01.070
"then the position is unchanged
from the beginning to the end.",00:16:01.070,00:16:06.120
"In other words, the
difference is 0.",00:16:06.120,00:16:08.140
"And the velocity, technically
rather than the speed.",00:16:08.140,00:16:12.632
"It's the speed to the right
and the speed to the left",00:16:12.632,00:16:14.840
"maybe are the same,
but one of them",00:16:14.840,00:16:16.640
"is going in the positive
direction and one of them",00:16:16.640,00:16:18.330
"is going in the
negative direction,",00:16:18.330,00:16:19.788
and they cancel each other.,00:16:19.788,00:16:22.090
"So if you have this
kind of situation,",00:16:22.090,00:16:25.340
we want that to be reflected.,00:16:25.340,00:16:26.940
"We like that
interpretation and we",00:16:26.940,00:16:28.550
"want to preserve it even
when-- in the case when",00:16:28.550,00:16:32.260
the function v is negative.,00:16:32.260,00:16:35.090
"And so I'm going to now extend
our notion of integration.",00:16:35.090,00:16:47.280
"So we'll extend integration
to the case f negative.",00:16:47.280,00:17:02.320
Or positive.,00:17:02.320,00:17:04.420
"In other words, it
could be any sign.",00:17:04.420,00:17:08.750
"Actually, there's no change.",00:17:08.750,00:17:10.550
The formulas are all the same.,00:17:10.550,00:17:12.430
"We just-- If this v is
going to be positive,",00:17:12.430,00:17:14.891
we write in a positive number.,00:17:14.891,00:17:16.140
"If it's going to be negative,
we write in a negative number.",00:17:16.140,00:17:18.640
And we just leave it alone.,00:17:18.640,00:17:20.270
"And the real-- So here's--
Let me carry out an example",00:17:20.270,00:17:25.480
and show you how it works.,00:17:25.480,00:17:29.230
"I'll carry out the example
on this blackboard up here.",00:17:29.230,00:17:32.750
Of the sine function.,00:17:32.750,00:17:33.670
"But we're going
to try two humps.",00:17:33.670,00:17:36.020
"We're going to try the
first hump and the one that",00:17:36.020,00:17:38.690
goes underneath.,00:17:38.690,00:17:39.880
There.,00:17:39.880,00:17:40.380
"So our example here is
going to be the integral",00:17:40.380,00:17:43.830
from 0 to 2pi of sin x dx.,00:17:43.830,00:17:50.910
"And now, because the fundamental
theorem is so important, and so",00:17:50.910,00:17:55.710
"useful, and so
convenient, we just",00:17:55.710,00:17:58.410
"assume that it be true
in this case as well.",00:17:58.410,00:18:01.100
"So we insist that this is going
to be -cos x, evaluated at 0",00:18:01.100,00:18:07.170
"and 2pi, with the difference.",00:18:07.170,00:18:10.540
"Now, when we carry
out that difference,",00:18:10.540,00:18:12.770
"what we get here is
-cos 2pi - (-cos 0).",00:18:12.770,00:18:19.320
"Which is -1 - (-1), which is 0.",00:18:24.670,00:18:33.670
"And the interpretation
of this is the following.",00:18:33.670,00:18:39.650
"Here's our double hump,
here's pi and here's 2pi.",00:18:39.650,00:18:43.840
"And all that's happening is that
the geometric interpretation",00:18:43.840,00:18:47.590
"that we had before of
the area under the curve",00:18:47.590,00:18:50.440
"has to be taken with a grain
of salt. In other words,",00:18:50.440,00:18:53.320
"I lied to you before when I said
that the definite integral was",00:18:53.320,00:18:56.530
the area under the curve.,00:18:56.530,00:18:57.610
It's not.,00:18:57.610,00:18:59.030
"The definite
integral is the area",00:18:59.030,00:19:00.790
"under the curve when
it's above the curve,",00:19:00.790,00:19:03.470
"and it counts negatively
when it's below the curve.",00:19:03.470,00:19:08.500
"So yesterday, my geometric
interpretation was incomplete.",00:19:08.500,00:19:12.690
And really just a plain lie.,00:19:12.690,00:19:19.180
"So the true geometric
interpretation",00:19:19.180,00:19:28.860
"of the definite integral
is plus the area",00:19:28.860,00:19:43.760
"above the axis,
above the x-axis,",00:19:43.760,00:19:49.890
minus the area below the x-axis.,00:19:49.890,00:20:00.360
As in the picture.,00:20:00.360,00:20:02.580
"I'm just writing
it down in words,",00:20:02.580,00:20:04.230
"but you should think
of it visually also.",00:20:04.230,00:20:08.870
So that's the setup here.,00:20:08.870,00:20:12.820
"And now we have the complete
definition of integrals.",00:20:12.820,00:20:17.530
"And I need to list for you
a bunch of their properties",00:20:17.530,00:20:19.950
and how we deal with integrals.,00:20:19.950,00:20:21.740
"So are there any
questions before we go on?",00:20:21.740,00:20:25.270
Yeah.,00:20:25.270,00:20:25.770
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:20:25.770,00:20:32.240
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:20:32.240,00:20:39.000
"So the question was,
wouldn't the absolute value",00:20:39.000,00:20:42.733
"of the velocity
function be involved?",00:20:42.733,00:20:45.720
The answer is yes.,00:20:45.720,00:20:48.300
"That is, that's one
question that you could ask.",00:20:48.300,00:20:51.730
"One question you
could ask is what's",00:20:51.730,00:20:54.430
the total distance traveled.,00:20:54.430,00:20:57.360
"And in that case,
you would keep track",00:20:57.360,00:21:00.600
"of the absolute value of
the velocity as you said,",00:21:00.600,00:21:05.534
"whether it's
positive or negative.",00:21:05.534,00:21:06.950
"And then you would get the
total length of this curve here.",00:21:06.950,00:21:13.970
"That's, however, not what the
definite integral measures.",00:21:13.970,00:21:18.520
"It measures the net
distance traveled.",00:21:18.520,00:21:21.640
So it's another thing.,00:21:21.640,00:21:24.049
"In other words, we can do that.",00:21:24.049,00:21:25.340
"We now have the
tools to do both.",00:21:25.340,00:21:27.890
"We could also-- So if you
like, the total distance",00:21:27.890,00:21:35.180
"is equal to the
integral of this.",00:21:35.180,00:21:39.550
From a to b.,00:21:39.550,00:21:40.730
"But the net distance is the
one without the absolute value",00:21:40.730,00:21:49.200
signs.,00:21:49.200,00:21:54.620
So that's correct.,00:21:54.620,00:21:57.350
Other questions?,00:21:57.350,00:22:03.950
All right.,00:22:03.950,00:22:04.590
"So now, let's talk about
properties of integrals.",00:22:04.590,00:22:23.950
"So the properties of integrals
that I want to mention to you",00:22:23.950,00:22:37.630
are these.,00:22:37.630,00:22:39.030
"The first one doesn't
bear too much comment.",00:22:39.030,00:22:47.280
"If you take the cumulative
integral of a sum,",00:22:47.280,00:22:53.370
"you're just trying to get the
sum of the separate integrals",00:22:53.370,00:22:58.820
here.,00:22:58.820,00:23:01.867
And I won't say much about that.,00:23:01.867,00:23:03.200
"That's because sums come
out, the because the integral",00:23:03.200,00:23:06.660
is a sum.,00:23:06.660,00:23:07.790
"Incidentally, you know
this strange symbol here,",00:23:07.790,00:23:15.330
"there's actually a reason
for it historically.",00:23:15.330,00:23:17.302
"If you go back to
old books, you'll",00:23:17.302,00:23:18.760
"see that it actually looks
a little bit more like an S.",00:23:18.760,00:23:21.880
This capital sigma is a sum.,00:23:21.880,00:23:24.530
"S for sum, because
everybody in those days",00:23:24.530,00:23:27.170
knew Latin and Greek.,00:23:27.170,00:23:28.400
"And this one is also
an S, but gradually it",00:23:28.400,00:23:31.360
"was such an important S
that they made a bigger.",00:23:31.360,00:23:33.390
"And then they stretched it out
and made it a little thinner,",00:23:33.390,00:23:35.890
"because it didn't fit into
one typesetting space.",00:23:35.890,00:23:40.590
"And so just for typesetting
reasons it got stretched.",00:23:40.590,00:23:43.550
And got a little bit skinny.,00:23:43.550,00:23:45.390
"Anyway, so it's really an
S. And in fact, in French",00:23:45.390,00:23:48.640
they call it sum.,00:23:48.640,00:23:50.800
Even though we call it integral.,00:23:50.800,00:23:53.900
So it's a sum.,00:23:53.900,00:23:57.690
"So it's consistent
with sums in this way.",00:23:57.690,00:24:00.450
"And similarly, similarly we can
factor constants out of sums.",00:24:00.450,00:24:09.040
"So if you have an integral like
this, the constant factors out.",00:24:09.040,00:24:20.820
"But definitely don't try to
get a function out of this.",00:24:20.820,00:24:25.140
That won't happen.,00:24:25.140,00:24:27.410
"OK, in other words, c
has to be a constant.",00:24:27.410,00:24:30.470
Doesn't depend on x.,00:24:30.470,00:24:41.320
The third property.,00:24:41.320,00:24:44.340
"What do I want to call
the third property here?",00:24:44.340,00:24:46.710
"I have sort of a preliminary
property, yes, here.",00:24:46.710,00:24:51.522
Which is the following.,00:24:51.522,00:24:52.480
And I'll draw a picture of it.,00:24:52.480,00:24:53.730
"I suppose you have three
points along a line.",00:24:53.730,00:24:59.410
"So then I'm going to
draw a picture of that.",00:24:59.410,00:25:01.300
"And I'm going to use the
interpretation above the curve,",00:25:01.300,00:25:03.940
"even though that's
not the whole thing.",00:25:03.940,00:25:05.564
"So here's a, here's
b and here's c.",00:25:05.564,00:25:07.990
"And you can see that
the area of this piece,",00:25:07.990,00:25:10.490
"of the first two pieces
here, when added together,",00:25:10.490,00:25:14.080
gives you the area of the whole.,00:25:14.080,00:25:15.820
"And that's the rule that
I'd like to tell you.",00:25:15.820,00:25:19.400
"So if you integrate
from a to b, and you",00:25:19.400,00:25:23.540
"add to that the
integral from b to c,",00:25:23.540,00:25:28.070
"you'll get the
integral from a to c.",00:25:28.070,00:25:37.344
"This is going to be just
a little preliminary,",00:25:37.344,00:25:39.260
"because the rule is a
little better than this.",00:25:39.260,00:25:41.830
"But I will explain
that in a minute.",00:25:41.830,00:25:47.970
"The fourth rule is
a very simple one.",00:25:47.970,00:25:52.540
"Which is that the integral
from a to a of f(x) dx",00:25:52.540,00:25:57.910
is equal to 0.,00:25:57.910,00:26:00.624
"Now, that you can see very
obviously because there's",00:26:00.624,00:26:02.790
no area.,00:26:02.790,00:26:04.140
No horizontal movement there.,00:26:04.140,00:26:05.900
"The rectangle is
infinitely thin,",00:26:05.900,00:26:08.430
and there's nothing there.,00:26:08.430,00:26:10.350
So this is the case.,00:26:10.350,00:26:12.020
"You can also interpret
it a F(a) - F(a).",00:26:12.020,00:26:17.860
"So that's also consistent
with our interpretation.",00:26:17.860,00:26:21.860
"In terms of the fundamental
theorem of calculus.",00:26:21.860,00:26:24.510
"And it's perfectly reasonable
that this is the case.",00:26:24.510,00:26:28.020
"Now, the fifth property
is a definition.",00:26:28.020,00:26:33.090
It's not really a property.,00:26:33.090,00:26:35.110
But it's very important.,00:26:35.110,00:26:38.080
"The integral from a to b of f(x)
dx equal to minus the integral",00:26:38.080,00:26:46.040
"from b to a, of f( x) dx.",00:26:46.040,00:26:50.960
"Now, really, the right-hand side
here is an undefined quantity",00:26:50.960,00:26:57.490
so far.,00:26:57.490,00:26:58.740
"We never said you
could ever do this",00:26:58.740,00:27:02.380
where the a is less than the b.,00:27:02.380,00:27:05.650
"Because this is
working backwards here.",00:27:05.650,00:27:09.600
"But we just have a convention
that that's the definition.",00:27:09.600,00:27:12.232
"Whenever we write
down this number,",00:27:12.232,00:27:13.690
"it's the same as minus
what that number is.",00:27:13.690,00:27:17.120
"And the reason for
all of these is again",00:27:17.120,00:27:20.229
"that we want them to be
consistent with the fundamental",00:27:20.229,00:27:22.520
theorem of calculus.,00:27:22.520,00:27:23.730
"Which is the thing that
makes all of this work.",00:27:23.730,00:27:26.250
"So if you notice the left-hand
side here is F(b) - F(a),",00:27:26.250,00:27:33.210
"capital F, the
antiderivative of little f.",00:27:33.210,00:27:36.410
"On the other hand, the
other side is minus,",00:27:36.410,00:27:39.420
"and if we just ignore that,
we say these are letters,",00:27:39.420,00:27:42.050
"if we were a machine, we didn't
know which one was bigger than",00:27:42.050,00:27:44.633
"which, we just plugged them in,
we would get here F(a) - F(b),",00:27:44.633,00:27:49.980
over here.,00:27:49.980,00:27:50.690
"And to make these two
things equal, what we want",00:27:50.690,00:27:53.402
is to put that minus sign in.,00:27:53.402,00:27:54.610
Now it's consistent.,00:27:54.610,00:27:59.620
"So again, these
rules are set up so",00:27:59.620,00:28:02.610
that everything is consistent.,00:28:02.610,00:28:05.420
"And now I want to
improve on rule 3 here.",00:28:05.420,00:28:11.190
"And point out to you - so
let me just go back to rule 3",00:28:11.190,00:28:15.010
"for a second - that now that
we can evaluate integrals",00:28:15.010,00:28:21.030
"regardless of the order, we
don't have to have a &lt; b,",00:28:21.030,00:28:24.920
"b &lt; c in order to make
sense out of this.",00:28:24.920,00:28:28.070
"We actually have the possibility
of considering integrals",00:28:28.070,00:28:31.740
"where the a's and the
b's and the c's are",00:28:31.740,00:28:34.180
in any order you want.,00:28:34.180,00:28:36.270
"And in fact, with
this definition,",00:28:36.270,00:28:38.630
"with this definition 5, 3 works
no matter what the numbers are.",00:28:38.630,00:28:43.140
So this is much more convenient.,00:28:43.140,00:28:44.710
"We don't, this is not necessary.",00:28:44.710,00:28:49.570
Not necessary.,00:28:49.570,00:28:51.070
"It just works
using convention 5.",00:28:51.070,00:28:57.220
"OK, with 5.",00:28:57.220,00:29:04.140
"Again, before I go
on, let me emphasize:",00:29:04.140,00:29:08.760
"we really want to respect
the sign of this velocity.",00:29:08.760,00:29:11.510
"We really want the net
change in the position.",00:29:11.510,00:29:15.110
"And we don't want this
absolute value here.",00:29:15.110,00:29:18.180
"Because otherwise, all of our
formulas are going to mess up.",00:29:18.180,00:29:20.740
"We won't always
be able to check.",00:29:20.740,00:29:22.260
"Sometimes you have
letters rather than",00:29:22.260,00:29:24.955
"actual numbers here,
and you won't know",00:29:24.955,00:29:26.580
whether a is bigger than b.,00:29:26.580,00:29:28.160
"So you'll want to know that
these formulas work and are",00:29:28.160,00:29:31.370
consistent in all situations.,00:29:31.370,00:29:36.410
"OK, I'm going to
trade these again.",00:29:36.410,00:29:39.550
"In order to preserve the
ordering 1 through 5.",00:29:39.550,00:29:47.250
"And now I have a sixth property
that I want to talk about.",00:29:47.250,00:29:54.200
This one is called estimation.,00:29:54.200,00:30:02.010
And it says the following.,00:30:02.010,00:30:05.470
"If f(x) &lt;= g(x), then the
integral from a to b of f(x) dx",00:30:05.470,00:30:18.270
"is less than or equal to the
integral from a to b of g(x)",00:30:18.270,00:30:23.180
dx.,00:30:23.180,00:30:28.300
"Now, this one says that if I'm
going more slowly than you,",00:30:28.300,00:30:36.860
then you go farther than I do.,00:30:36.860,00:30:40.840
OK.,00:30:40.840,00:30:41.760
That's all it's saying.,00:30:41.760,00:30:43.710
"For this one, you'd
better have a &lt; b.",00:30:43.710,00:30:47.870
You need it.,00:30:47.870,00:30:49.100
"Because we flip the signs when
we flip the order of a and b.",00:30:49.100,00:30:55.360
"So this one, it's essential
that the lower limit be smaller",00:30:55.360,00:30:59.410
than the upper limit.,00:30:59.410,00:31:04.600
"But let me just emphasize,
because we're dealing",00:31:04.600,00:31:06.930
with the generalities of this.,00:31:06.930,00:31:08.370
"Actually if one of
these is negative",00:31:08.370,00:31:10.350
"and the other one is
negative, then it also works.",00:31:10.350,00:31:14.650
"This one ends up being, if
f is more negative than g,",00:31:14.650,00:31:17.510
"then this added up thing is
more negative than that one.",00:31:17.510,00:31:22.380
"Again, under the assumption
that a is less than b.",00:31:22.380,00:31:25.270
"So as I wrote it it's
in full generality.",00:31:25.270,00:31:34.760
Let's illustrate this one.,00:31:34.760,00:31:37.490
"And then we have one more
property to learn after that.",00:31:37.490,00:31:47.030
"So let me give you an
example of estimation.",00:31:47.030,00:31:58.970
"The example is the same as
one that I already gave you.",00:31:58.970,00:32:01.970
"But this time, because we
have the tool of integration,",00:32:01.970,00:32:05.080
"we can just follow our
noses and it works.",00:32:05.080,00:32:11.290
"I start with the
inequality, so I'm",00:32:11.290,00:32:14.400
"trying to illustrate
estimation, so I",00:32:14.400,00:32:16.090
"want to start with
an inequality which",00:32:16.090,00:32:17.673
is what the hypothesis is here.,00:32:17.673,00:32:19.290
"And I'm going to
integrate the inequality",00:32:19.290,00:32:21.480
to get this conclusion.,00:32:21.480,00:32:22.900
And see what conclusion it is.,00:32:22.900,00:32:25.860
"The inequality that I want
to take is that e^x &gt;= 1,",00:32:25.860,00:32:30.160
for x &gt;= 0.,00:32:30.160,00:32:32.800
"That's going to be
our starting place.",00:32:32.800,00:32:37.620
"And now I'm going
to integrate it.",00:32:37.620,00:32:39.070
"That is, I'm going
to use estimation",00:32:39.070,00:32:40.850
to see what that gives.,00:32:40.850,00:32:42.420
"Well, I'm going to
integrate, say, from 0 to b.",00:32:42.420,00:32:45.100
"I can't integrate below 0
because it's only true above 0.",00:32:45.100,00:32:50.010
"This is e^x dx greater than or
equal to the integral from 0",00:32:50.010,00:32:54.390
to b of 1 dx.,00:32:54.390,00:33:01.990
"Alright, let's work out
what each of these is.",00:33:01.990,00:33:05.980
"The first one, e^x dx, is,
the antiderivative is e^x,",00:33:05.980,00:33:14.370
evaluated at 0 and b.,00:33:14.370,00:33:16.120
So that's e^b - e^0.,00:33:16.120,00:33:18.930
Which is e^b - 1.,00:33:18.930,00:33:23.510
"The other one,
you're supposed to be",00:33:23.510,00:33:28.560
"able to get by
the rectangle law.",00:33:28.560,00:33:32.270
"This is one rectangle
of base b and height 1.",00:33:32.270,00:33:35.840
So the answer is b.,00:33:35.840,00:33:37.350
"Or you can do it by
antiderivatives, but it's b.",00:33:37.350,00:33:44.100
"That means that our inequality
says if I just combine these",00:33:44.100,00:33:49.010
"two things together,
that e^b - 1 &gt;= b.",00:33:49.010,00:33:55.640
"And that's the same
thing as e^b &gt;= 1 + b.",00:33:55.640,00:34:02.040
"Again, this only
works for b &gt;= 0.",00:34:02.040,00:34:05.010
"Notice that if b were
negative, this would be a well",00:34:05.010,00:34:10.520
defined quantity.,00:34:10.520,00:34:13.520
"But this estimation
would be false.",00:34:13.520,00:34:18.240
"We need that the b &gt; 0 in
order for this to make sense.",00:34:18.240,00:34:22.010
So this was used.,00:34:22.010,00:34:24.590
"And that's a good thing, because
this inequality is suspect.",00:34:24.590,00:34:28.640
"Actually, it turns out to
be true when b is negative.",00:34:28.640,00:34:32.060
"But we certainly
didn't prove it.",00:34:32.060,00:34:38.830
"I'm going to just
repeat this process.",00:34:38.830,00:34:42.260
So let's repeat it.,00:34:42.260,00:34:46.400
"Starting from the
inequality, the conclusion,",00:34:46.400,00:34:49.890
which is sitting right here.,00:34:49.890,00:34:51.390
"But I'll write it in a form
e^x &gt;= 1 + x, for x &gt;= 0.",00:34:51.390,00:34:59.970
"And now, if I
integrate this one,",00:34:59.970,00:35:02.160
"I get the integral from 0 to b,
e^x dx is greater than or equal",00:35:02.160,00:35:06.245
"to the integral from
0 to b, (1 + x) dx,",00:35:06.245,00:35:12.360
"and I remind you that we've
already calculated this one.",00:35:12.360,00:35:16.020
This is e^b - 1.,00:35:16.020,00:35:19.000
"And the other one is
not hard to calculate.",00:35:19.000,00:35:21.710
"The antiderivative
is x + x^2 / 2.",00:35:21.710,00:35:25.930
"We're evaluating
that at 0 and b.",00:35:25.930,00:35:28.690
"So that comes out
to be b + b^2 / 2.",00:35:28.690,00:35:34.830
"And so our conclusion is that
the left side, which is e^b -",00:35:34.830,00:35:43.550
1 &gt;= b + b^2 / 2.,00:35:43.550,00:35:48.300
And this is for b &gt;= 0.,00:35:48.300,00:35:51.930
"And that's the same thing
as e^b &gt;= 1 + b + b^2 / 2.",00:35:51.930,00:36:00.510
"This one actually is
false for b negative,",00:36:00.510,00:36:04.050
"so that's something
that you have",00:36:04.050,00:36:09.280
"to be careful with
the b positive's here.",00:36:09.280,00:36:15.560
"So you can keep on
going with this,",00:36:15.560,00:36:17.350
and you didn't have to think.,00:36:17.350,00:36:20.360
"And you'll produce a very
interesting polynomial,",00:36:20.360,00:36:23.330
"which is a good
approximation to e^b.",00:36:23.330,00:36:25.340
"So that's it for the
basic properties.",00:36:30.720,00:36:34.520
"Now there's one tricky property
that I need to tell you about.",00:36:34.520,00:36:38.980
"It's not that tricky,
but it's a little tricky.",00:36:38.980,00:36:47.920
And this is change of variables.,00:36:47.920,00:37:07.390
"Change of variables
in integration,",00:37:07.390,00:37:09.600
we've actually already done.,00:37:09.600,00:37:11.220
"We called that, the last
time we talked about it,",00:37:11.220,00:37:14.190
we called it substitution.,00:37:14.190,00:37:23.430
"And the idea here,
if you may remember,",00:37:23.430,00:37:26.210
"was that if you're faced
with an integral like this,",00:37:26.210,00:37:31.550
"you can change it to, if you put
in u = u(x) and you have a du,",00:37:31.550,00:37:38.340
"which is equal to
u'(x) du-- dx, sorry.",00:37:38.340,00:37:42.700
"Then you can change the
integral as follows.",00:37:42.700,00:37:45.900
"This is the same as
g(u(x)) u'(x) dx.",00:37:45.900,00:37:51.630
"This was the general
procedure for substitution.",00:37:51.630,00:37:58.920
"What's new today is that we're
going to put in the limits.",00:37:58.920,00:38:05.500
"If you have a limit here,
u_1, and a limit here, u_2,",00:38:05.500,00:38:10.350
"you want to know what
the relationship is",00:38:10.350,00:38:12.790
"between the limits here and
the limits when you change",00:38:12.790,00:38:15.690
variables to the new variables.,00:38:15.690,00:38:18.780
"And it's the simplest
possible thing.",00:38:18.780,00:38:21.290
"Namely the two limits over here
are in the same relationship",00:38:21.290,00:38:25.760
"as u(x) is to this
symbol u here.",00:38:25.760,00:38:29.130
"In other words, u_1 =
u(x_1), and u_2 = u(x_2).",00:38:29.130,00:38:35.830
That's what works.,00:38:35.830,00:38:39.310
"Now there's only
one danger here,",00:38:39.310,00:38:42.620
"there's one subtlety
which is, this only works",00:38:42.620,00:38:48.230
if u' does not change sign.,00:38:48.230,00:39:02.010
"I've been worrying a little
bit about going backwards",00:39:02.010,00:39:04.680
"and forwards, and
I allowed myself",00:39:04.680,00:39:06.400
"to reverse and do all
kinds of stuff, right,",00:39:06.400,00:39:08.525
with these integrals.,00:39:08.525,00:39:09.400
So we're sort of free to do it.,00:39:09.400,00:39:11.560
"Well, this is one case where
you want to avoid it, OK?",00:39:11.560,00:39:14.560
Just don't do it.,00:39:14.560,00:39:15.850
"It is possible, actually,
to make sense out of it,",00:39:15.850,00:39:17.990
"but it's also possible to get
yourself infinitely confused.",00:39:17.990,00:39:21.810
"So just make sure
that-- Now, it's",00:39:21.810,00:39:24.350
"OK if u' is always negative,
or always going one way,",00:39:24.350,00:39:27.580
"so OK if u' is always
positive, you're always",00:39:27.580,00:39:30.034
"going the other way,
but if you mix them",00:39:30.034,00:39:31.700
up you'll get yourself mixed up.,00:39:31.700,00:39:39.960
Let me give you an example.,00:39:39.960,00:39:46.210
"The example will be maybe
close to what we did last time.",00:39:46.210,00:39:54.230
"When we first did
substitution, I mean.",00:39:54.230,00:39:57.900
"So the integral from 1 to 2,
this time I'll put in definite",00:39:57.900,00:40:02.160
"limits, of x^2 plus-- sorry,
maybe I call this x^3. x^3 + 2,",00:40:02.160,00:40:09.690
"let's say, I don't know,
to the 5th power, x^2 dx.",00:40:09.690,00:40:17.950
"So this is an example
of an integral",00:40:17.950,00:40:20.310
"that we would have tried to
handle by substitution before.",00:40:20.310,00:40:25.900
"And the substitution we would
have used is u = x^3 + 2.",00:40:25.900,00:40:36.590
"And that's exactly what
we're going to do here.",00:40:36.590,00:40:38.560
"But we're just going to also
take into account the limits.",00:40:38.560,00:40:44.710
"The first step, as in any
substitution or change",00:40:44.710,00:40:47.730
"of variables, is this.",00:40:47.730,00:40:54.070
"And so we can fill
in the things that we",00:40:54.070,00:40:57.056
would have done previously.,00:40:57.056,00:40:58.180
"Which is that this is the
integral and this is u^5.",00:40:58.180,00:41:01.790
"And then because this is
3x^2, we see that this is 3.",00:41:01.790,00:41:09.300
"Sorry, let's write
it the other way.",00:41:09.300,00:41:13.130
1/3 du = x^2 dx.,00:41:13.130,00:41:17.480
"So that's what I'm going to
plug in for this factor here.",00:41:17.480,00:41:20.370
"So here's 1/3 du,
which replaces that.",00:41:20.370,00:41:26.480
"But now there's
the extra feature.",00:41:26.480,00:41:29.430
The extra feature is the limits.,00:41:29.430,00:41:31.660
"So here, really in
disguise, because, and now",00:41:31.660,00:41:35.160
this is incredibly important.,00:41:35.160,00:41:38.280
"This is one of the reasons why
we use this notation dx and du.",00:41:38.280,00:41:44.070
"We want to remind
ourselves which variable",00:41:44.070,00:41:47.120
is involved in the integration.,00:41:47.120,00:41:49.170
"And especially if you're the
one naming the variables,",00:41:49.170,00:41:52.470
"you may get mixed
up in this respect.",00:41:52.470,00:41:54.760
"So you must know which variable
is varying between 1 and 2.",00:41:54.760,00:41:59.200
"And the answer is, it's
x is the one that's",00:41:59.200,00:42:01.510
varying between 1 and 2.,00:42:01.510,00:42:04.150
"So in disguise, even
though I didn't write it,",00:42:04.150,00:42:06.870
"it was contained in
this little symbol here.",00:42:06.870,00:42:10.260
This reminded us which variable.,00:42:10.260,00:42:11.840
"You'll find this amazingly
important when you",00:42:11.840,00:42:14.140
get to multivariable calculus.,00:42:14.140,00:42:16.480
"When there are many
variables floating around.",00:42:16.480,00:42:18.810
"So this is an incredibly
important distinction to make.",00:42:18.810,00:42:21.390
"So now, over here
we have a limit.",00:42:21.390,00:42:23.300
"But of course it's supposed
to be with respect to u, now.",00:42:23.300,00:42:26.270
"So we need to calculate what
those corresponding limits are.",00:42:26.270,00:42:29.490
"And indeed it's just, I plug in
here u_1 is going to be equal",00:42:29.490,00:42:33.270
"to what I plug in for x = 1,
that's going to be 1^3 + 2,",00:42:33.270,00:42:37.430
which is 3.,00:42:37.430,00:42:38.760
"And then u_2 is 2^3 + 2,
which is equal to 10, right?",00:42:38.760,00:42:46.390
8 + 2 = 10.,00:42:46.390,00:42:47.960
"So this is the integral
from 3 to 10, of u^5 1/3 du.",00:42:47.960,00:42:57.700
"And now I can
finish the problem.",00:42:57.700,00:43:00.380
"This is 1/18 u^6, from 3 to 10.",00:43:00.380,00:43:06.390
"And this is where the
most common mistake occurs",00:43:06.390,00:43:10.000
in substitutions of this type.,00:43:10.000,00:43:12.360
"Which is that if
you ignore this,",00:43:12.360,00:43:14.850
"and you plug in
these 1 and 2 here,",00:43:14.850,00:43:17.020
"you think, oh I should just
be putting it at 1 and 2.",00:43:17.020,00:43:20.090
"But actually, it
should be, the u-value",00:43:20.090,00:43:22.940
"that we're interested in,
and the lower limit is u = 3",00:43:22.940,00:43:26.400
and u = 10 is the upper limit.,00:43:26.400,00:43:29.660
So those are suppressed here.,00:43:29.660,00:43:31.405
"But those are the
ones that we want.",00:43:31.405,00:43:35.620
"And so, here we go.",00:43:35.620,00:43:37.360
"It's 1/18 times some ridiculous
number which I won't calculate.",00:43:37.360,00:43:41.770
10^6 - - 3^6.,00:43:41.770,00:43:44.260
"Yes, question.",00:43:47.820,00:43:48.630
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:43:48.630,00:44:07.250
"PROFESSOR: So, if
you want to do things",00:44:07.250,00:44:10.380
"with where you're worrying
about the sign change,",00:44:10.380,00:44:16.290
"the right strategy is,
what you suggested works.",00:44:16.290,00:44:20.820
"And in fact I'm going to
do an example right now",00:44:20.820,00:44:23.090
on this subject.,00:44:23.090,00:44:24.220
"But, the right strategy is
to break it up into pieces.",00:44:24.220,00:44:30.160
"Where u' has one sign
or the other, OK?",00:44:30.160,00:44:34.950
Let me show you an example.,00:44:34.950,00:44:37.430
Where things go wrong.,00:44:37.430,00:44:40.700
"And I'll tell you how
to handle it, roughly.",00:44:40.700,00:44:47.900
So here's our warning.,00:44:47.900,00:44:55.790
"Suppose you're integrating
from -1 to 1, x^2 dx.",00:44:55.790,00:45:00.280
Here's an example.,00:45:00.280,00:45:02.810
"And you have the temptation
to plug in u = x^2.",00:45:02.810,00:45:09.654
"Now, of course, we know
how to integrate this.",00:45:09.654,00:45:11.570
"But let's just pretend we
were stubborn and wanted",00:45:11.570,00:45:16.390
to use substitution.,00:45:16.390,00:45:19.260
Then we have du = 2x dx.,00:45:19.260,00:45:26.610
"And now if I try to
make the correspondence,",00:45:26.610,00:45:30.170
"notice that the limits
are u_1 = (-1)^2,",00:45:30.170,00:45:37.130
that's the bottom limit.,00:45:37.130,00:45:38.860
And u_2 is the upper limit.,00:45:38.860,00:45:40.830
"That's 1^2, that's
also equal to 1.",00:45:40.830,00:45:43.450
Both limits are 1.,00:45:43.450,00:45:45.250
So this is going from 1 to 1.,00:45:45.250,00:45:47.750
"And no matter what it is,
we know it's going to be 0.",00:45:47.750,00:45:53.350
But we know this is not 0.,00:45:53.350,00:45:55.610
"This is the integral
of a positive quantity.",00:45:55.610,00:45:58.620
"And the area under a curve is
going to be a positive area.",00:45:58.620,00:46:03.139
So this is a positive quantity.,00:46:03.139,00:46:04.430
It can't be 0.,00:46:04.430,00:46:07.300
"If you actually plug it in,
it looks equally strange.",00:46:07.300,00:46:12.090
"You put in here this u and then,
so that would be for the u^2.",00:46:12.090,00:46:16.160
"And then to plug in for dx,
you would write dx = 1/(2x) du.",00:46:16.160,00:46:22.110
"And then you might
write that as this.",00:46:22.110,00:46:27.760
"And so what I should put in
here is this quantity here.",00:46:27.760,00:46:31.500
"Which is a perfectly
OK integral.",00:46:31.500,00:46:33.360
"And it has a value, I
mean, it's what it is.",00:46:33.360,00:46:37.870
It's 0.,00:46:37.870,00:46:39.140
So of course this is not true.,00:46:39.140,00:46:45.270
"And the reason is that
u was equal to x^2,",00:46:45.270,00:46:51.540
"and u'(x) was equal to 2x, which
was positive for x positive,",00:46:51.540,00:46:57.340
and negative for x negative.,00:46:57.340,00:47:00.070
"And this was the sign change
which causes us trouble.",00:47:00.070,00:47:03.470
"If we break it off into its
two halves, then it'll be OK",00:47:03.470,00:47:08.160
and you'll be able to use this.,00:47:08.160,00:47:09.710
"Now, there was a mistake.",00:47:09.710,00:47:12.120
"And this was essentially
what you were saying.",00:47:12.120,00:47:15.540
"That is, it's possible to see
this happening as you're doing",00:47:15.540,00:47:19.050
it if you're very careful.,00:47:19.050,00:47:21.680
"There's a mistake
in this process,",00:47:21.680,00:47:23.610
"and the mistake is
in the transition.",00:47:23.610,00:47:26.290
This is a mistake here.,00:47:26.290,00:47:28.230
"Maybe I haven't used
any red yet today,",00:47:28.230,00:47:33.340
so I get to use some red here.,00:47:33.340,00:47:34.940
Oh boy.,00:47:34.940,00:47:36.750
"This is not true, here.",00:47:36.750,00:47:38.310
This step here.,00:47:38.310,00:47:39.200
So why isn't it true?,00:47:39.200,00:47:40.470
"It's not true for
the standard reason.",00:47:40.470,00:47:43.500
"Which is that really, x = plus
or minus square root of u.",00:47:43.500,00:47:50.670
"And if you stick to
one side or the other,",00:47:50.670,00:47:53.930
"you'll have a coherent
formula for it.",00:47:53.930,00:47:55.660
"One of them will be the plus and
one of them will be the minus",00:47:55.660,00:47:58.243
"and it will work out when you
separate it into its pieces.",00:47:58.243,00:48:01.980
So you could do that.,00:48:01.980,00:48:02.880
But this is a can of worms.,00:48:02.880,00:48:04.100
So I avoid this.,00:48:04.100,00:48:06.250
"And just do it in a place where
the inverse is well defined.",00:48:06.250,00:48:10.112
"And where the
function either moves",00:48:10.112,00:48:11.570
steadily up or steadily down.,00:48:11.570,00:48:13.880
