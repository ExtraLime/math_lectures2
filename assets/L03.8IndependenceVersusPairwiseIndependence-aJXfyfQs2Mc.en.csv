"We will now consider an example
that illustrates the",00:00:02.040,00:00:05.440
"difference between the notion
of independence of a",00:00:05.440,00:00:09.030
"collection of events and
the notion of pairwise",00:00:09.030,00:00:12.990
"independence within
that collection.",00:00:12.990,00:00:16.460
The model is simple.,00:00:16.460,00:00:18.290
"We have a fair coin which
we flip twice.",00:00:18.290,00:00:22.700
"So at each flip, there
is probability 1/2",00:00:22.700,00:00:25.460
of obtaining heads.,00:00:25.460,00:00:28.950
"Furthermore, we assume that the
two flips are independent",00:00:28.950,00:00:32.340
of each other.,00:00:32.340,00:00:33.770
"Let H1 be the event that the
first coin toss resulted in",00:00:33.770,00:00:38.760
"heads, which corresponds to this
event in this diagram.",00:00:38.760,00:00:43.655
"Let H2 be the event that the
second toss resulted in heads,",00:00:46.370,00:00:51.700
"which is this event
in the diagram--",00:00:51.700,00:00:56.570
"the two ways that we can have
the second toss being heads.",00:00:56.570,00:01:02.245
"Now, we're assuming that the
tosses are independent.",00:01:04.800,00:01:08.590
"So the event heads-heads has a
probability which is equal to",00:01:08.590,00:01:13.500
"the probability that the first
toss resulted in heads--",00:01:13.500,00:01:16.539
that's 1/2--,00:01:16.539,00:01:17.390
"times the probability that the
second toss resulted in heads,",00:01:17.390,00:01:20.200
which is 1/2.,00:01:20.200,00:01:21.460
So the product is 1/4.,00:01:21.460,00:01:23.730
"We have probability 1/4
for this outcome.",00:01:23.730,00:01:26.880
"Now, the total probability of
event H1 is 1/2, which means",00:01:26.880,00:01:31.430
"that the probability of what
remains should be 1/4, so that",00:01:31.430,00:01:36.560
"the sum of these two
numbers is 1/2.",00:01:36.560,00:01:39.320
"By the same argument, the
probability of this outcome,",00:01:39.320,00:01:42.270
"tails-heads , should be 1/4.",00:01:42.270,00:01:45.880
We have a total of 3/4.,00:01:45.880,00:01:47.940
So what's left is 1/4.,00:01:47.940,00:01:50.070
"And that's going to be the
probability of the outcome",00:01:50.070,00:01:53.080
tails-tails .,00:01:53.080,00:01:55.500
"Let us now introduce a new
event, namely the event that",00:01:55.500,00:02:01.470
"the two tosses had
the same result.",00:02:01.470,00:02:05.040
"So this is the event that we
obtain either heads heads or",00:02:05.040,00:02:10.728
tails-tails.,00:02:10.728,00:02:11.978
"Schematically, event C
corresponds to this blue",00:02:14.210,00:02:18.560
region in the diagram.,00:02:18.560,00:02:21.290
"Is this event C independent
from the events H1 and H2?",00:02:21.290,00:02:26.760
"Let us first look for pairwise
independence.",00:02:26.760,00:02:30.520
"Let's look at the probability
that H1 occurs",00:02:30.520,00:02:34.440
and C occurs as well.,00:02:34.440,00:02:37.150
"So the first toss resulted
in heads.",00:02:37.150,00:02:39.820
"And the two tosses had
the same result.",00:02:39.820,00:02:43.060
"So this is the same as the
probability of obtaining heads",00:02:43.060,00:02:47.200
followed by heads.,00:02:47.200,00:02:48.620
"And this corresponds to just
this outcome that has",00:02:51.340,00:02:54.780
probability 1/4.,00:02:54.780,00:02:56.090
"How about the product of the
probabilities of H1 and of C?",00:02:59.930,00:03:07.250
Is it the same?,00:03:07.250,00:03:09.242
"Well, the probability
of H1 is 1/2.",00:03:09.242,00:03:12.290
And the probability of C--,00:03:15.240,00:03:16.900
what is it?,00:03:16.900,00:03:17.850
"Event C consists of
two outcomes.",00:03:17.850,00:03:21.450
"Each one of these outcomes
has probability 1/4.",00:03:21.450,00:03:24.030
"So the total is, again, 1/2.",00:03:24.030,00:03:27.550
"And therefore, the product of
these probabilities is 1/4.",00:03:27.550,00:03:32.430
"So we notice that the
probability of the two events",00:03:32.430,00:03:34.829
"happening is the same as the
product of their individual",00:03:34.829,00:03:38.020
"probabilities, and therefore,
H1 and C",00:03:38.020,00:03:42.370
are independent events.,00:03:42.370,00:03:44.065
"By the same argument, H2 and C
are going to be independent.",00:03:46.610,00:03:52.500
It's a symmetrical situation.,00:03:52.500,00:03:55.690
"H1 and H2 are also independent
from each other.",00:03:55.690,00:03:59.940
"So we have all of the conditions
for pairwise",00:03:59.940,00:04:02.740
independence.,00:04:02.740,00:04:04.470
"Let us now check whether
we have independence.",00:04:04.470,00:04:08.710
"To check for independence, we
need to also look into the",00:04:08.710,00:04:12.730
"probability of all three events
happening and see",00:04:12.730,00:04:16.329
"whether it is equal to the
product of the individual",00:04:16.329,00:04:19.070
probabilities.,00:04:19.070,00:04:20.420
"So the probability of all
three events happening--",00:04:20.420,00:04:23.770
"this is the probability
that H1 occurs and H2",00:04:23.770,00:04:27.450
occurs and C occurs.,00:04:27.450,00:04:30.750
What is this event?,00:04:30.750,00:04:34.260
"Heads in the first toss, heads
in the second toss, and the",00:04:34.260,00:04:37.460
two tosses are the same--,00:04:37.460,00:04:39.770
"this happens if and only
if the outcome is",00:04:39.770,00:04:44.280
heads followed by heads.,00:04:44.280,00:04:46.780
And this has probability 1/4.,00:04:46.780,00:04:51.060
"On the other hand, if we
calculate the probability of",00:04:51.060,00:04:54.480
"H1 times the probability of H2
times the probability of C, we",00:04:54.480,00:05:01.850
"get 1/2 times 1/2 times
1/2, which is 1/8.",00:05:01.850,00:05:07.490
"These two numbers
are different.",00:05:07.490,00:05:10.900
"And therefore, one of the
conditions that we had for",00:05:10.900,00:05:15.020
independence is violated.,00:05:15.020,00:05:18.340
"So in this example, H1,
H2, and C are pairwise",00:05:18.340,00:05:23.800
"independent, but they're not
independent in the sense of an",00:05:23.800,00:05:29.040
"independent collection
of events.",00:05:29.040,00:05:32.330
"How are we to understand
this intuitively?",00:05:32.330,00:05:34.345
"If I tell you that event H1
occurred and I ask you for the",00:05:37.800,00:05:46.520
"conditional probability
of C given that H1",00:05:46.520,00:05:49.940
"[occurred], what is this?",00:05:49.940,00:05:53.050
"This is the probability that
we obtain, given that the",00:05:53.050,00:05:57.360
"first event is heads, the first
result is heads, the",00:05:57.360,00:06:01.790
"only way that you can have the
two tosses having the same",00:06:01.790,00:06:05.030
"result is going to be in
the second toss also",00:06:05.030,00:06:08.970
resulting in heads.,00:06:08.970,00:06:12.020
"And since H2 and H1 are
independent, this is just the",00:06:12.020,00:06:15.680
"probability that we have heads
in the second toss.",00:06:15.680,00:06:19.340
And this number is 1/2.,00:06:19.340,00:06:22.110
"And 1/2 is also the same as the
probability of C. That's",00:06:22.110,00:06:26.720
"another way of understanding the
independence of H1 and C.",00:06:26.720,00:06:31.380
"Given that the first toss
resulted in heads, this does",00:06:31.380,00:06:36.510
"not help you in any way in
guessing whether the two",00:06:36.510,00:06:41.580
"tosses will have the
same result or not.",00:06:41.580,00:06:45.750
"The first one was heads, but the
second one could be either",00:06:45.750,00:06:49.290
"heads or tails with
equal probability.",00:06:49.290,00:06:52.870
"So event H1 does not carry any
useful information about the",00:06:52.870,00:06:57.670
"occurrence or non-occurrence of
event C. On the other hand,",00:06:57.670,00:07:04.210
"if I were to tell you that
both events, H1 and H2,",00:07:04.210,00:07:12.210
"happened, what would
the conditional",00:07:12.210,00:07:14.560
probability of C be?,00:07:14.560,00:07:17.560
"If both H1 and H2 occurred, then
the results of the two",00:07:17.560,00:07:21.250
"coin tosses were identical, so
you know that C also occurred.",00:07:21.250,00:07:27.400
"So this probability
is equal to 1.",00:07:27.400,00:07:31.540
"And this number, 1, is
different from the",00:07:31.540,00:07:36.000
"unconditional probability
of C, which is 1/2.",00:07:36.000,00:07:41.040
"So we have here a situation
where knowledge of H1 having",00:07:41.040,00:07:46.190
"occurred does not help you in
making a better guess on",00:07:46.190,00:07:51.409
whether C is going to occur.,00:07:51.409,00:07:53.980
"H1 by itself does not carry
any useful information.",00:07:53.980,00:07:57.490
"But the two events together,
H1 and H2, do carry useful",00:07:57.490,00:08:02.320
information about C.,00:08:02.320,00:08:03.630
"Once you know that H1 and
H2 occurred, then C",00:08:03.630,00:08:06.360
is certain to occur.,00:08:06.360,00:08:08.040
"So your original probability for
C, which was 1/2, now gets",00:08:08.040,00:08:12.430
revised to a value of 1.,00:08:12.430,00:08:14.610
"So H1 and H2 carry information
relevant to C. And therefore,",00:08:14.610,00:08:19.720
"C is not independent from these
two events collectively.",00:08:19.720,00:08:25.290
And we say that events H1.,00:08:25.290,00:08:28.810
"H2, and C are not independent.",00:08:28.810,00:08:31.420
