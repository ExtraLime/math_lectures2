ANA BELL: So here's some code.,00:00:23.330,00:00:26.590
"I'm defining a
function named sq,",00:00:26.590,00:00:30.800
and it takes in two parameters.,00:00:30.800,00:00:33.410
"I'm defining a function named
f, takes in one parameter,",00:00:33.410,00:00:37.580
"and then I'm doing
these two lines.",00:00:37.580,00:00:40.460
"The first one is just
calling function sq,",00:00:40.460,00:00:43.640
"and the next one is
just printing the value.",00:00:43.640,00:00:45.613
So let's first see what-- nice.,00:00:48.710,00:00:53.080
OK.,00:00:53.080,00:00:55.850
Let's work through it.,00:00:55.850,00:00:57.000
"So The first things we see here
is two function definitions,",00:01:01.491,00:01:08.130
right?,00:01:08.130,00:01:08.630
"So we don't currently
care about what's",00:01:08.630,00:01:10.254
"inside them right now because
we haven't made a function",00:01:10.254,00:01:12.920
call yet.,00:01:12.920,00:01:14.100
"So the first thing we do
is we have the function",00:01:14.100,00:01:16.880
call calc equal sq f and 2.,00:01:16.880,00:01:21.250
OK?,00:01:21.250,00:01:22.070
"So inside sq, we're
going to have func and x.",00:01:22.070,00:01:29.470
"And func is going
to get mapped to f,",00:01:32.640,00:01:35.700
"and x is going to get
mapped to 2, right?",00:01:35.700,00:01:39.670
"So we're taking the
variables in order",00:01:39.670,00:01:41.530
and mapping them to those.,00:01:41.530,00:01:43.210
"Func is f, and x is 2.",00:01:43.210,00:01:46.560
"First thing the
function does, sq,",00:01:46.560,00:01:48.690
"is create this variable
y is equal to x squared.",00:01:48.690,00:01:52.690
"So we're going to
have y is equal to 4.",00:01:52.690,00:01:56.145
"And then we're going
to return func y.",00:01:59.490,00:02:02.970
"So func of y, this is
going to be-- we're",00:02:02.970,00:02:07.980
"just replacing the
parameters f of 4, right?",00:02:07.980,00:02:14.980
"So now this is
another function call.",00:02:14.980,00:02:18.840
We know what f is.,00:02:18.840,00:02:20.710
This program knows what f is.,00:02:20.710,00:02:22.516
"f is going to be this part right
here, which returns x squared.",00:02:22.516,00:02:29.300
OK?,00:02:29.300,00:02:30.250
"So in f, x gets mapped to
whatever variable we put in,",00:02:30.250,00:02:39.315
which in this case is 4.,00:02:39.315,00:02:40.830
"And we're going to
return to whoever",00:02:45.450,00:02:48.390
"called us, which is over
here, 4 squared, which is 16.",00:02:48.390,00:02:54.520
OK?,00:02:54.520,00:02:55.330
So f of 4 gets replaced with 16.,00:02:55.330,00:02:57.545
"And f of 4 was up here, right?",00:03:02.260,00:03:06.870
"We're just popping
out of scopes now.",00:03:06.870,00:03:09.040
So f of 4 was up here.,00:03:09.040,00:03:11.090
"So then that line there, return
func y, is going to return 16.",00:03:11.090,00:03:17.710
"And whoever called us was down
here, calc is equal to 16.",00:03:17.710,00:03:21.584
"And then we're
just printing calc.",00:03:21.584,00:03:23.000
So 16 was right.,00:03:27.000,00:03:29.990
Yay.,00:03:29.990,00:03:31.540
