OK.,00:00:11.825,00:00:12.325
cameras are rolling.,00:00:14.830,00:00:15.900
"This is lecture fourteen,
starting a new chapter.",00:00:15.900,00:00:21.840
Chapter about orthogonality.,00:00:21.840,00:00:24.660
"What it means for
vectors to be orthogonal.",00:00:24.660,00:00:29.480
"What it means for
subspaces to be orthogonal.",00:00:29.480,00:00:33.070
"What it means for
bases to be orthogonal.",00:00:33.070,00:00:37.370
"So ninety degrees, this is
a ninety-degree chapter.",00:00:37.370,00:00:44.460
So what does it mean --,00:00:44.460,00:00:47.800
let me jump to subspaces.,00:00:47.800,00:00:50.890
"Because I've drawn
here the big picture.",00:00:50.890,00:00:54.830
This is the 18.06 picture here.,00:00:54.830,00:00:59.910
"And hold it down, guys.",00:00:59.910,00:01:04.800
"So this is the picture and we
know a lot about that picture",00:01:04.800,00:01:09.280
already.,00:01:09.280,00:01:10.550
"We know the dimension
of every subspace.",00:01:10.550,00:01:14.570
"We know that these
dimensions are r and n-r.",00:01:14.570,00:01:22.040
"We know that these
dimensions are r and m-r.",00:01:22.040,00:01:26.320
"What I want to show now is
what this figure is saying,",00:01:29.680,00:01:33.780
that the angle --,00:01:33.780,00:01:38.140
"the figure is just my attempt to
draw what I'm now going to say,",00:01:38.140,00:01:43.520
"that the angle between these
subspaces is ninety degrees.",00:01:43.520,00:01:50.510
"And the angle between these
subspaces is ninety degrees.",00:01:50.510,00:01:53.890
"Now I have to say
what does that mean?",00:01:53.890,00:01:55.670
"What does it mean for
subspaces to be orthogonal?",00:01:55.670,00:02:01.080
"But I hope you appreciate
the beauty of this picture,",00:02:01.080,00:02:06.540
"that that those
subspaces are going",00:02:06.540,00:02:11.340
to come out to be orthogonal.,00:02:11.340,00:02:14.170
Those two and also those two.,00:02:14.170,00:02:18.140
"So that's like one point,
one important point",00:02:18.140,00:02:24.870
"to step forward in
understanding those subspaces.",00:02:24.870,00:02:28.960
"We knew what each
subspace was like,",00:02:28.960,00:02:31.140
we could compute bases for them.,00:02:31.140,00:02:33.500
Now we know more.,00:02:33.500,00:02:35.440
Or we will in a few minutes.,00:02:35.440,00:02:38.240
OK.,00:02:38.240,00:02:38.750
"I have to say first of all what
does it mean for two vectors",00:02:38.750,00:02:43.110
to be orthogonal?,00:02:43.110,00:02:44.920
So let me start with that.,00:02:44.920,00:02:46.470
Orthogonal vectors.,00:02:49.560,00:02:50.560
"The word orthogonal is
-- is just another word",00:02:57.010,00:03:00.610
for perpendicular.,00:03:00.610,00:03:02.620
"It means that in
n-dimensional space",00:03:02.620,00:03:05.510
"the angle between those
vectors is ninety degrees.",00:03:05.510,00:03:10.290
"It means that they
form a right triangle.",00:03:10.290,00:03:13.480
"It even means that the going
way back to the Greeks that this",00:03:13.480,00:03:20.940
"angle that this triangle
a vector x, a vector x,",00:03:20.940,00:03:29.010
"and a vector x+y -- of course
that'll be the hypotenuse,",00:03:29.010,00:03:36.560
"so what was it the Greeks
figured out and it's neat.",00:03:36.560,00:03:42.750
It's the fact that the --,00:03:42.750,00:03:45.860
"so these are orthogonal,
this is a right angle, if --",00:03:45.860,00:03:50.980
"so let me put the great
name down, Pythagoras,",00:03:50.980,00:03:57.660
"I'm looking for --
what I looking for?",00:03:57.660,00:04:00.540
"I'm looking for the condition if
you give me two vectors, how do",00:04:00.540,00:04:05.980
I know if they're orthogonal?,00:04:05.980,00:04:08.540
"How can I tell two
perpendicular vectors?",00:04:08.540,00:04:11.490
"And actually you
probably know the answer.",00:04:11.490,00:04:13.830
Let me write the answer down.,00:04:13.830,00:04:15.770
"Orthogonal vectors, what's
the test for orthogonality?",00:04:15.770,00:04:20.550
"I take the dot product which I
tend to write as x transpose y,",00:04:20.550,00:04:29.430
"because that's a
row times a column,",00:04:29.430,00:04:33.060
"and that matrix multiplication
just gives me the right thing,",00:04:33.060,00:04:38.390
"that x1y1+x2y2 and so on, so
these vectors are orthogonal",00:04:38.390,00:04:45.340
"if this result x
transpose y is zero.",00:04:45.340,00:04:52.560
That's the test.,00:04:52.560,00:04:54.130
OK.,00:04:54.130,00:04:55.340
"Can I connect that
to other things?",00:04:55.340,00:05:00.850
"I mean -- it's just beautiful
that here we have we're in n",00:05:00.850,00:05:06.480
"dimensions, we've got
a couple of vectors,",00:05:06.480,00:05:09.390
"we want to know the
angle between them,",00:05:09.390,00:05:11.620
"and the right thing to look at
is the simplest thing that you",00:05:11.620,00:05:16.750
"could imagine, the dot product.",00:05:16.750,00:05:18.930
OK.,00:05:18.930,00:05:19.600
Now why?,00:05:19.600,00:05:20.890
"So I'm answering the
question now why --",00:05:20.890,00:05:24.430
"let's add some justification
to this fact, that's the test.",00:05:24.430,00:05:33.500
"OK, so Pythagoras would say
we've got a right triangle,",00:05:33.500,00:05:38.050
"if that length squared plus
that length squared equals",00:05:38.050,00:05:41.400
that length squared.,00:05:41.400,00:05:43.170
"OK, can I write it as x
squared plus y squared equals",00:05:43.170,00:05:51.800
x plus y squared?,00:05:51.800,00:05:54.890
"Now don't, please don't think
that this is always true.",00:05:54.890,00:05:59.120
"This is only going
to be true in this --",00:05:59.120,00:06:03.360
"it's going to be equivalent
to orthogonality.",00:06:03.360,00:06:07.600
"For other triangles of
course, it's not true.",00:06:07.600,00:06:11.180
For other triangles it's not.,00:06:11.180,00:06:12.540
"But for a right triangle
somehow that fact",00:06:12.540,00:06:16.860
should connect to that fact.,00:06:16.860,00:06:18.810
"Can we just make
that connection?",00:06:18.810,00:06:20.240
"What's the connection between
this test for orthogonality",00:06:23.580,00:06:28.090
"and this statement
of orthogonality?",00:06:28.090,00:06:31.040
"Well, I guess I have to say
what is the length squared?",00:06:31.040,00:06:35.520
"So let's continue on the board
underneath with that equation.",00:06:35.520,00:06:42.370
"Give me another way to express
the length squared of a vector.",00:06:42.370,00:06:47.800
"And let me just
give you a vector.",00:06:47.800,00:06:49.960
"The vector one, two, three.",00:06:49.960,00:06:53.420
That's in three dimensions.,00:06:53.420,00:06:55.730
"What is the length squared of
the vector x equal one, two,",00:06:55.730,00:07:00.720
three?,00:07:00.720,00:07:03.410
"So how do you find
the length squared?",00:07:03.410,00:07:06.820
"Well, really you just, you want
the length of that vector that",00:07:06.820,00:07:10.710
"goes along one -- up
two, and out three --",00:07:10.710,00:07:15.220
"and we'll come back to
that right triangle stuff.",00:07:15.220,00:07:19.910
"The length squared is
exactly x transpose x.",00:07:19.910,00:07:25.928
"Whenever I see x
transpose x, I know",00:07:28.870,00:07:31.230
"I've got a number
that's positive.",00:07:31.230,00:07:35.040
"It's a length
squared unless it --",00:07:35.040,00:07:37.750
"unless x happens to
be the zero vector,",00:07:37.750,00:07:40.440
"that's the one case
where the length is zero.",00:07:40.440,00:07:44.500
"So right -- this is just x1
squared plus x2 squared plus",00:07:44.500,00:07:49.770
"so on, plus xn squared.",00:07:49.770,00:07:51.920
"So one -- in the example I gave
you what was the length squared",00:07:51.920,00:07:55.830
"of that vector one, two, three?",00:07:55.830,00:07:59.230
"So you square those, you
get one, four and nine,",00:07:59.230,00:08:02.070
"you add, you get fourteen.",00:08:02.070,00:08:04.310
"So the vector one, two,
three has length fourteen.",00:08:04.310,00:08:08.590
"So let me just put
down a vector here.",00:08:08.590,00:08:13.000
"Let x be the vector
one, two, three.",00:08:13.000,00:08:15.995
"Let me cook up a vector
that's orthogonal to it.",00:08:19.220,00:08:22.060
"So what's the vector
that's orthogonal?",00:08:25.550,00:08:27.590
"So right down here, x squared
is one plus four plus nine,",00:08:27.590,00:08:33.270
"fourteen, let me cook up a
vector that's orthogonal to it,",00:08:33.270,00:08:38.480
"we'll get right that that
-- those two vectors are",00:08:38.480,00:08:47.170
"orthogonal, the length
of y squared is five,",00:08:47.170,00:08:55.320
"and x plus y is one
and two making three,",00:08:55.320,00:09:02.520
"two and minus one making one,
three and zero making three,",00:09:02.520,00:09:06.290
"and the length of this squared
is nine plus one plus nine,",00:09:06.290,00:09:13.010
nineteen.,00:09:13.010,00:09:15.700
"And sure enough, I
haven't proved anything.",00:09:15.700,00:09:20.810
"I've just like checked to
see that my test x transpose",00:09:20.810,00:09:28.900
"y equals zero, which
is true, right?",00:09:28.900,00:09:31.530
"Everybody sees that x
transpose y is zero here?",00:09:31.530,00:09:35.370
That's maybe the main point.,00:09:35.370,00:09:37.740
"That you should get really
quick at doing x transpose y,",00:09:37.740,00:09:41.910
"so it's just this plus this
plus this and that's zero.",00:09:41.910,00:09:45.980
"And sure enough, that clicks
with fourteen plus five",00:09:45.980,00:09:51.730
agreeing with nineteen.,00:09:51.730,00:09:53.190
"Now let me just do
that in letters.",00:09:53.190,00:09:56.780
So that's y transpose y.,00:09:56.780,00:10:01.110
"And this is x plus y
transpose x plus y.",00:10:01.110,00:10:08.150
OK.,00:10:08.150,00:10:09.290
"So I'm looking, again,
this isn't always true.",00:10:09.290,00:10:12.530
I repeat.,00:10:12.530,00:10:14.110
"This is going to be true
when we have a right angle.",00:10:14.110,00:10:18.020
"And let's just --
well, of course,",00:10:18.020,00:10:20.210
"I'm just going to
simplify this stuff here.",00:10:20.210,00:10:22.850
There's an x transpose x there.,00:10:22.850,00:10:25.960
"And there's a y
transpose y there.",00:10:25.960,00:10:29.850
And there's an x transpose y.,00:10:29.850,00:10:34.450
And there's a y transpose x.,00:10:34.450,00:10:36.610
"I knew I could do that
simplification because I'm just",00:10:41.700,00:10:46.990
"doing matrix multiplication and
I've just followed the rules.",00:10:46.990,00:10:50.150
OK.,00:10:50.150,00:10:50.880
So x transpose x-s cancel.,00:10:50.880,00:10:53.650
Y transpose y-s cancel.,00:10:53.650,00:10:55.910
And what about these guys?,00:10:55.910,00:10:57.950
"What can you tell me about
the inner product of x with y",00:10:57.950,00:11:03.400
"and the inner
product of y with x?",00:11:03.400,00:11:06.890
Is there a difference?,00:11:06.890,00:11:09.620
"I think if we -- while
we're doing real vectors,",00:11:09.620,00:11:15.150
"which is all we're doing now,
there isn't a difference,",00:11:15.150,00:11:18.310
there's no difference.,00:11:18.310,00:11:19.660
"If I take x transpose
y, that'll give me zero,",00:11:19.660,00:11:23.690
"if I took y transpose x I would
have the same x1y1 and x2y2",00:11:23.690,00:11:28.840
"and x3y3, it would be
the same, so this is --",00:11:28.840,00:11:35.280
"this is the same as
that, this is really",00:11:35.280,00:11:37.820
"I'll knock that guy out
and say two of these.",00:11:37.820,00:11:40.070
So actually that's the --,00:11:43.700,00:11:47.360
"this equation boiled down
to this thing being zero.",00:11:47.360,00:11:51.960
Right?,00:11:51.960,00:11:52.670
"Everything else canceled
and this equation",00:11:52.670,00:11:56.010
boiled down to that one.,00:11:56.010,00:11:57.250
So that's really all I wanted.,00:11:57.250,00:12:00.450
"I just wanted to check that
Pythagoras for a right triangle",00:12:00.450,00:12:08.170
"led me to this -- of course
I cancel the two now.",00:12:08.170,00:12:13.250
No problem.,00:12:13.250,00:12:14.680
"To x transpose y equals
zero as the test.",00:12:14.680,00:12:18.880
Fair enough.,00:12:18.880,00:12:19.610
OK.,00:12:19.610,00:12:21.190
You knew it was coming.,00:12:21.190,00:12:23.150
"The dot product of
orthogonal vectors is zero.",00:12:23.150,00:12:27.010
"It's just -- I just want
to say that's really neat.",00:12:27.010,00:12:31.010
That it comes out so well.,00:12:31.010,00:12:32.760
All right.,00:12:32.760,00:12:34.830
"Now what about -- so
now I know if two --",00:12:34.830,00:12:38.760
when two vectors are orthogonal.,00:12:38.760,00:12:40.700
"By the way, what about if one of
these guys is the zero vector?",00:12:40.700,00:12:45.860
"Suppose x is the zero
vector, and y is whatever.",00:12:45.860,00:12:51.660
Are they orthogonal?,00:12:51.660,00:12:55.010
Sure.,00:12:55.010,00:12:57.190
"In math the one thing
about math is you're",00:12:57.190,00:12:59.310
supposed to follow the rules.,00:12:59.310,00:13:01.910
"So you're supposed to --
if x is the zero vector,",00:13:01.910,00:13:05.450
"you're supposed to take the
zero vector dotted with y",00:13:05.450,00:13:09.330
"and of course you
always get zero.",00:13:09.330,00:13:12.180
"So just so we're all
sure, the zero vector",00:13:12.180,00:13:17.340
is orthogonal to everybody.,00:13:17.340,00:13:20.730
But what I want to --,00:13:20.730,00:13:24.770
"what I now want to think
about is subspaces.",00:13:24.770,00:13:32.240
"What does it mean for me to
say that some subspace is",00:13:32.240,00:13:37.530
"orthogonal to some
other subspace?",00:13:37.530,00:13:39.320
So OK.,00:13:39.320,00:13:41.110
Now I've got to write this down.,00:13:41.110,00:13:42.590
"So because we're defining
definition of subspace",00:13:42.590,00:13:47.960
"S is orthogonal so to
subspace let's say T,",00:13:47.960,00:14:02.390
"so I've got a
couple of subspaces.",00:14:02.390,00:14:04.130
"And what should it mean for
those guys to be orthogonal?",00:14:07.350,00:14:11.480
"It's just sort of what's
the natural extension",00:14:11.480,00:14:14.780
"from orthogonal vectors
to orthogonal subspaces?",00:14:14.780,00:14:19.990
"Well, and in
particular, let's think",00:14:19.990,00:14:26.820
"of some orthogonal
subspaces, like this wall.",00:14:26.820,00:14:34.410
Let's say in three dimensions.,00:14:34.410,00:14:37.300
"So the blackboard extended
to infinity, right, is a --",00:14:37.300,00:14:41.320
"is a subspace, a plane, a
two-dimensional subspace.",00:14:41.320,00:14:44.950
"It's a little bumpy
but anyway, it's a --",00:14:47.680,00:14:51.310
"think of it as a subspace, let
me take the floor as another",00:14:51.310,00:14:57.001
subspace.,00:14:57.001,00:14:57.500
"Again, it's not
a great subspace,",00:15:01.850,00:15:07.840
"MIT only built it
like so-so, but I'll",00:15:07.840,00:15:15.400
put the origin right here.,00:15:15.400,00:15:18.840
"So the origin of the
world is right there.",00:15:18.840,00:15:23.040
OK.,00:15:23.040,00:15:23.540
"Thereby giving linear algebra
its proper importance in this.",00:15:26.730,00:15:30.340
OK.,00:15:30.340,00:15:31.190
"So there is one subspace,
there's another one.",00:15:31.190,00:15:34.290
The floor.,00:15:34.290,00:15:35.940
And are they orthogonal?,00:15:35.940,00:15:42.200
"What does it mean
for two subspaces",00:15:42.200,00:15:44.130
"to be orthogonal and
in that special case",00:15:44.130,00:15:46.460
are they orthogonal?,00:15:46.460,00:15:47.650
All right.,00:15:47.650,00:15:48.290
Let's finish this sentence.,00:15:48.290,00:15:50.950
"What does it mean
means we have to know",00:15:50.950,00:15:58.501
what we're talking about,00:15:58.501,00:15:59.500
here.,00:15:59.500,00:16:00.040
"So what would be a reasonable
idea of orthogonal?",00:16:00.040,00:16:05.310
"Well, let me put
the right thing up.",00:16:05.310,00:16:08.740
"It means that every vector
in S, every vector in S,",00:16:08.740,00:16:17.930
is orthogonal to --,00:16:17.930,00:16:23.565
what I going to say?,00:16:27.290,00:16:30.080
Every vector in T.,00:16:30.080,00:16:38.000
"That's a reasonable
and it's a good",00:16:38.000,00:16:42.990

definition for two subspaces",00:16:42.990,00:16:45.560
to be orthogonal.,00:16:45.560,00:16:47.010
"But I just want you to see,
hey, what does that mean?",00:16:47.010,00:16:50.740
"So answer the
question about the --",00:16:50.740,00:16:53.620
the blackboard and the floor.,00:16:53.620,00:16:57.440
"Are those two subspaces,
they're two-dimensional, right,",00:16:57.440,00:17:01.440
and we're in R^3.,00:17:01.440,00:17:03.830
"It's like a xz plane or
something and a xy plane.",00:17:03.830,00:17:09.665

blackboard orthogonal",00:17:17.109,00:17:19.560
"to every vector in the floor,
starting from the origin",00:17:19.560,00:17:23.349
right there?,00:17:23.349,00:17:24.140
Yes or no?,00:17:27.640,00:17:28.900
I could take a vote.,00:17:28.900,00:17:31.010
"Well we get some
yeses and some noes.",00:17:31.010,00:17:35.040
No is the answer.,00:17:35.040,00:17:36.170
They're not.,00:17:36.170,00:17:37.810
"You can tell me a
vector in the blackboard",00:17:37.810,00:17:41.340
"and a vector in the floor
that are not orthogonal.",00:17:41.340,00:17:43.995
"Well you can tell me
quite a few, I guess.",00:17:49.360,00:17:54.960
"Maybe like I could take
some forty-five-degree guy",00:17:54.960,00:17:59.140
"in the blackboard, and
something in the floor,",00:17:59.140,00:18:05.730
"they're not at ninety
degrees, right?",00:18:05.730,00:18:08.580
"In fact, even more,
you could tell me",00:18:08.580,00:18:10.780
"a vector that's in both the
blackboard plane and the floor",00:18:10.780,00:18:17.140
"plane, so it's certainly
not orthogonal to itself.",00:18:17.140,00:18:20.550
"So for sure, those two
planes aren't orthogonal.",00:18:20.550,00:18:25.600
What would that be?,00:18:25.600,00:18:26.950
So what's a vector that's --,00:18:26.950,00:18:29.350
in both of those planes?,00:18:29.350,00:18:32.320
"It's this guy running
along the crack",00:18:32.320,00:18:35.170
"there, in the intersection,
the intersection.",00:18:35.170,00:18:39.540
"A vector, you know --",00:18:39.540,00:18:41.360
"if two subspaces meet at some
vector, well then for sure",00:18:41.360,00:18:45.460
"they're not orthogonal,
because that vector is in one",00:18:45.460,00:18:51.170
"and it's in the other, and
it's not orthogonal to itself",00:18:51.170,00:18:54.240
unless it's zero.,00:18:54.240,00:18:55.770
"So the only I mean
so orthogonal is",00:18:55.770,00:19:01.000
"for me to say these two
subspaces are orthogonal first",00:19:01.000,00:19:04.220
"of all I'm certainly saying
that they don't intersect",00:19:04.220,00:19:09.080
in any nonzero vector.,00:19:09.080,00:19:14.550
"But also I mean more than
that just not intersecting",00:19:14.550,00:19:18.430
isn't good,00:19:18.430,00:19:18.990
enough.,00:19:18.990,00:19:19.490
"So give me an example, oh,
let's say in the plane, oh well,",00:19:19.490,00:19:26.150
"when do we have orthogonal
subspaces in the plane?",00:19:26.150,00:19:30.090
"Yeah, tell me in the
plane, so we don't --",00:19:30.090,00:19:32.100
"there aren't that many different
subspaces in the plane.",00:19:32.100,00:19:34.960
"What what have we got in the
plane as possible subspaces?",00:19:34.960,00:19:38.385
"The zero vector, real small.",00:19:40.900,00:19:44.420
A line through the origin.,00:19:44.420,00:19:47.330
Or the whole plane.,00:19:47.330,00:19:49.570
OK.,00:19:49.570,00:19:50.420
"Now so when is a line
through the origin orthogonal",00:19:50.420,00:19:55.769
to the whole plane?,00:19:55.769,00:19:56.560
"Never, right, never.",00:19:59.870,00:20:02.070
"When is a line through the
origin orthogonal to the zero",00:20:02.070,00:20:05.620
subspace?,00:20:05.620,00:20:06.120
Always.,00:20:09.310,00:20:10.180
Right.,00:20:10.180,00:20:10.910
"When is a line through
the origin orthogonal",00:20:10.910,00:20:13.480
"to a different line
through the origin?",00:20:13.480,00:20:15.920
"Well, that's the case that
we all have a clear picture",00:20:15.920,00:20:19.880
"of, they --",00:20:19.880,00:20:21.070
"the two lines have to
meet at ninety degrees.",00:20:21.070,00:20:23.610
"They have only the -- so
that's like this simple case",00:20:23.610,00:20:28.340
I'm talking about.,00:20:28.340,00:20:29.090
"There's one subspace,
there's the other subspace.",00:20:29.090,00:20:31.970
They only meet at zero.,00:20:31.970,00:20:33.770
And they're orthogonal.,00:20:33.770,00:20:35.570
OK.,00:20:35.570,00:20:36.340
Now.,00:20:36.340,00:20:37.930
"So we now know what it means for
two subspaces to be orthogonal.",00:20:37.930,00:20:43.540
"And now I want to say that
this is true for the row",00:20:43.540,00:20:47.240
space and the null space.,00:20:47.240,00:20:49.080
OK.,00:20:49.080,00:20:49.740
So that's the neat fact.,00:20:49.740,00:20:53.880
"So row space is orthogonal
to the null space.",00:20:53.880,00:21:05.720
Now how did I come up with that?,00:21:05.720,00:21:07.435
"But you see the rank it's
great, that means that these --",00:21:12.540,00:21:16.500
"that these subspaces are
just the right things,",00:21:16.500,00:21:19.020
"they're just cutting
the whole space up",00:21:19.020,00:21:23.220
"into two perpendicular
subspaces.",00:21:23.220,00:21:27.560
OK.,00:21:27.560,00:21:28.060
So why?,00:21:28.060,00:21:28.560
"Well, what have I
got to work with?",00:21:33.710,00:21:38.040
All I know is the null space.,00:21:38.040,00:21:41.230
"The null space has vectors
that solve Ax equals zero.",00:21:41.230,00:21:46.360
So this is a guy x.,00:21:46.360,00:21:49.780
x is in the null space.,00:21:49.780,00:21:53.940
Then Ax is zero.,00:21:53.940,00:21:57.350
"So why is it orthogonal
to the rows of A?",00:21:57.350,00:22:03.250
"If I write down Ax
equals zero, which",00:22:03.250,00:22:05.340
"is all I know about
the null space,",00:22:05.340,00:22:07.720
"then I guess I want you to
see that that's telling me,",00:22:07.720,00:22:13.130
"just that equation right
there is telling me",00:22:13.130,00:22:16.430
"that the rows of A,
let me write it out.",00:22:16.430,00:22:19.670
There's row one of A.,00:22:19.670,00:22:24.000
Row two.,00:22:24.000,00:22:24.540
Row m of A. that's A.,00:22:27.290,00:22:32.300
And it's multiplying X.,00:22:32.300,00:22:34.530
And it's producing zero.,00:22:34.530,00:22:36.560
OK.,00:22:36.560,00:22:37.060
"Written out that
way you'll see it.",00:22:41.550,00:22:47.200
"So I'm saying that a
vector in the row space",00:22:47.200,00:22:50.200
"is perpendicular to this
guy X in the null space.",00:22:50.200,00:22:54.250
And you see why?,00:22:54.250,00:22:57.310
"Because this equation
is telling you",00:22:57.310,00:22:59.550
"that row one of A multiplying
that's a dot product, right?",00:22:59.550,00:23:06.330
"Row one of A dot product with
this x is producing this zero.",00:23:06.330,00:23:11.480
"So x is orthogonal
to the first row.",00:23:11.480,00:23:15.970
And to the second row.,00:23:15.970,00:23:17.670
"Row two of A, x is
giving that zero.",00:23:17.670,00:23:20.630
"Row m of A times x
is giving that zero.",00:23:20.630,00:23:23.590
So x is --,00:23:23.590,00:23:25.020
"the equation is
telling me that x",00:23:25.020,00:23:27.380
is orthogonal to all the rows.,00:23:27.380,00:23:31.309
"Right, it's just sitting there.",00:23:31.309,00:23:32.600
"That's all we -- it had to
be sitting there because we",00:23:32.600,00:23:36.380
"didn't know anything more
about the null space than this.",00:23:36.380,00:23:40.000
"And now I guess to be
totally complete here",00:23:40.000,00:23:46.120
"I'd now check that
x is orthogonal",00:23:46.120,00:23:49.350
to each separate row.,00:23:49.350,00:23:51.720
"But what else strictly
speaking do I have to do?",00:23:51.720,00:23:55.710
"To show that those
subspaces are orthogonal,",00:23:58.670,00:24:02.340
"I have to take this x in
the null space and show that",00:24:02.340,00:24:05.580
"it's orthogonal to every
vector in the row space,",00:24:05.580,00:24:10.380
"every vector in the
row space, so what --",00:24:10.380,00:24:12.740
what else is in the row space?,00:24:12.740,00:24:15.330
"This row is in the row space,
that row is in the row space,",00:24:15.330,00:24:18.970
"they're all there, but it's
not the whole row space,",00:24:18.970,00:24:22.870
"right, we just have to
like remember, what does it",00:24:22.870,00:24:24.990
"mean, what does that
word space telling us?",00:24:24.990,00:24:29.610
"And what else is
in the row space?",00:24:29.610,00:24:34.470
Besides the rows?,00:24:34.470,00:24:37.810
All their combinations.,00:24:37.810,00:24:41.990
"So I really have to
check that sure enough",00:24:41.990,00:24:44.680
"if x is perpendicular
to row one,",00:24:44.680,00:24:46.770
"row two, all the
different separate rows,",00:24:46.770,00:24:49.720
"then also x is perpendicular
to a combination of the rows.",00:24:49.720,00:24:54.110
"And that's just matrix
multiplication again.",00:24:54.110,00:24:57.000
"You know, I have row
one transpose x is zero,",00:24:57.000,00:25:03.300
"so on, row two
transpose x is zero,",00:25:03.300,00:25:11.000
"so I'm entitled to multiply that
by some c1, this by some c2,",00:25:11.000,00:25:16.800
"I still have zeroes,
I'm entitled to add,",00:25:16.800,00:25:20.700
"so I have c1 row one so --
so all this when I put that",00:25:20.700,00:25:24.760
"together that's big parentheses
c1 row one plus c2 row two",00:25:24.760,00:25:33.290
and so on.,00:25:33.290,00:25:34.780
Transpose x is zero.,00:25:34.780,00:25:38.220
Right?,00:25:38.220,00:25:38.720
"I just added the
zeroes and got zero,",00:25:38.720,00:25:41.380
"and I just added these
following the rule.",00:25:41.380,00:25:43.760
No big deal.,00:25:46.550,00:25:48.490
"The whole point was
right sitting in that.",00:25:48.490,00:25:51.890
OK.,00:25:51.890,00:25:54.610
"So if I come back to this figure
now I'm like a happier person.",00:25:54.610,00:26:02.480
Because I have this --,00:26:02.480,00:26:05.090
"I now see how those
subspaces are oriented.",00:26:05.090,00:26:10.730
"And these subspaces
are also oriented.",00:26:10.730,00:26:14.090
"Well, actually why is
that orthogonality?",00:26:14.090,00:26:20.200
"Well, it's the same
statement for A transpose",00:26:20.200,00:26:23.660
that that one was for A.,00:26:23.660,00:26:25.330
"So I won't take time
to prove it again",00:26:25.330,00:26:27.670
"because we've checked
it for every matrix",00:26:27.670,00:26:32.500
"and A transpose is just
as good a matrix as A.",00:26:32.500,00:26:35.960
So we're orthogonal over there.,00:26:35.960,00:26:39.520
"So we really have
carved up this --",00:26:39.520,00:26:46.180
"this was like carving
up m-dimensional space",00:26:46.180,00:26:50.070
"into two subspaces and
this one was carving up",00:26:50.070,00:26:56.070
"n-dimensional space
into two subspaces.",00:26:56.070,00:27:01.810
"And well, one more thing here.",00:27:01.810,00:27:06.500
One more important thing.,00:27:06.500,00:27:07.550
"Let me move into
three dimensions.",00:27:11.110,00:27:13.330
"Tell me a couple of orthogonal
subspaces in three dimensions",00:27:15.990,00:27:22.780
"that somehow don't carve
up the whole space,",00:27:22.780,00:27:27.450
there's stuff left there.,00:27:27.450,00:27:30.330
"I'm thinking of a couple
of orthogonal lines.",00:27:30.330,00:27:34.830
"If I -- suppose I'm in
three dimensions, R^3.",00:27:34.830,00:27:38.550
"And I have one line, one
one-dimensional subspace,",00:27:38.550,00:27:43.510
and a perpendicular one.,00:27:43.510,00:27:46.030
"Could those be the row
space and the null space?",00:27:46.030,00:27:51.170
"Could those be the row
space and the null space?",00:27:51.170,00:27:54.590
"Could I be in three
dimensions and have",00:27:54.590,00:28:00.520
"a row space that's a line and
a null space that's a line?",00:28:00.520,00:28:05.930
No.,00:28:05.930,00:28:07.270
Why not?,00:28:07.270,00:28:10.180
"Because the dimensions
aren't right.",00:28:10.180,00:28:11.840
Right?,00:28:11.840,00:28:12.340
The dimensions are no good.,00:28:12.340,00:28:14.080
"The dimensions here, r and
n-r, they add up to three,",00:28:14.080,00:28:19.050
they add up to n.,00:28:19.050,00:28:21.490
If I take --,00:28:21.490,00:28:23.220
just follow that example --,00:28:23.220,00:28:26.800
"if the row space
is one-dimensional,",00:28:26.800,00:28:30.910

a good in R^3,",00:28:30.910,00:28:36.030

"five, two, four, ten.",00:28:39.560,00:28:43.470
"What's the dimension
of that row space?",00:28:43.470,00:28:45.330
One.,00:28:48.590,00:28:50.220

of the null space?",00:28:50.220,00:28:52.260
"Tell what's the null space
look like in that case?",00:28:56.160,00:28:59.130
"The row space is a line, right?",00:28:59.130,00:29:01.670
"One-dimensional, it's just a
line through one, two, five.",00:29:01.670,00:29:06.440
"Geometrically what's
the row space look like?",00:29:06.440,00:29:08.370
What's its dimension?,00:29:13.950,00:29:15.660
"So here r here n
is three, the rank",00:29:15.660,00:29:20.920
"is one, so the dimension
of the null space,",00:29:20.920,00:29:26.610
"so I'm looking at
this x, x1, x2, x3.",00:29:26.610,00:29:32.180
To give zero.,00:29:32.180,00:29:33.680
"So the dimension of the null
space is we all know is two.",00:29:33.680,00:29:43.300
Right.,00:29:43.300,00:29:43.800
It's a plane.,00:29:43.800,00:29:45.440
"And now actually we know, we
see better, what plane is it?",00:29:45.440,00:29:49.770
What plane is it?,00:29:49.770,00:29:52.660

perpendicular to one,",00:29:52.660,00:29:57.500
"two, five.",00:29:57.500,00:29:59.950
Right?,00:29:59.950,00:30:00.450
We now see.,00:30:00.450,00:30:01.350
"In fact the two, four,
ten didn't actually",00:30:01.350,00:30:04.710
have any effect at all.,00:30:04.710,00:30:07.000
I could have just ignored that.,00:30:07.000,00:30:09.750
"That didn't change the row
space or the null space.",00:30:09.750,00:30:14.340
"I'll just make
that one equation.",00:30:14.340,00:30:17.051
Yeah.,00:30:17.051,00:30:17.550
OK.,00:30:17.550,00:30:18.000
Sure.,00:30:18.000,00:30:18.499
That's the easiest to deal with.,00:30:18.499,00:30:21.210
One equation.,00:30:21.210,00:30:22.130
Three unknowns.,00:30:22.130,00:30:24.440
And I want to ask --,00:30:24.440,00:30:32.670
"what would the equation
give me the null space,",00:30:32.670,00:30:37.180
"and you would have
said back in September",00:30:37.180,00:30:41.380
"you would have said
it gives you a plane,",00:30:41.380,00:30:43.410
and we're completely right.,00:30:43.410,00:30:46.530
"And the plane it gives
you, the normal vector,",00:30:46.530,00:30:49.530
"you remember in calculus, there
was this dumb normal vector",00:30:49.530,00:30:53.610
called N.,00:30:53.610,00:30:54.760
Well there it is.,00:30:54.760,00:30:55.496
"One, two, five.",00:30:55.496,00:30:56.120
OK.,00:30:56.120,00:30:56.620
"What is the what's the
point I want to make here?",00:30:56.620,00:31:08.820
I want to make --,00:31:08.820,00:31:10.010
"I want to emphasize
that not only are the --",00:31:10.010,00:31:14.300
let me write it in words.,00:31:14.300,00:31:15.410
"So I want to write the null
space and the row space are",00:31:19.930,00:31:33.900
"orthogonal, that's this
neat fact, which we've --",00:31:33.900,00:31:40.290
"we've just checked
from Ax equals zero,",00:31:40.290,00:31:43.240
"but now I want to say more
because there's a little more",00:31:43.240,00:31:48.750
that's true.,00:31:48.750,00:31:51.190
"Their dimensions add
to the whole space.",00:31:51.190,00:31:54.940
"So that's like a little
extra information.",00:31:54.940,00:31:57.660
"That it's not like
I could have --",00:31:57.660,00:31:59.860
"I couldn't have a line and
a line in three dimensions.",00:31:59.860,00:32:03.030
"Those don't add up one and
one don't add to three.",00:32:03.030,00:32:07.130
"So I used the word orthogonal
complements in R^n.",00:32:07.130,00:32:17.820
"And the idea of
this word complement",00:32:17.820,00:32:20.000
"is that the orthogonal
complement of a row space",00:32:20.000,00:32:28.720
"contains not just some vectors
that are orthogonal to it,",00:32:28.720,00:32:32.950
but all.,00:32:32.950,00:32:34.400
So what does that mean?,00:32:34.400,00:32:36.050
"That means that the null
space contains all, not just",00:32:36.050,00:32:42.260
"some but all, vectors that are
perpendicular to the row space.",00:32:42.260,00:32:51.270
OK.,00:32:51.270,00:32:52.260
"Really what I've done in this
half of the lecture is just",00:32:52.260,00:33:04.190
"notice some of the
nice geometry that --",00:33:04.190,00:33:09.100
"that we didn't pick up before
because we didn't discuss",00:33:09.100,00:33:12.030
perpendicular vectors before.,00:33:12.030,00:33:15.010
But it was all sitting there.,00:33:15.010,00:33:16.800
And now we picked it up.,00:33:16.800,00:33:18.440
"That these vectors are
orthogonal complements.",00:33:18.440,00:33:21.370
"And I guess I even
call this part",00:33:21.370,00:33:23.740
"one of the fundamental
theorem of linear algebra.",00:33:23.740,00:33:26.730
"The fundamental theorem
of linear algebra",00:33:26.730,00:33:32.330
"is about these four
subspaces, so part one",00:33:32.330,00:33:37.230
"is about their dimension, maybe
I should call it part two now.",00:33:37.230,00:33:41.660
Their dimensions we got.,00:33:41.660,00:33:44.600
"Now we're getting their
orthogonality, that's part two.",00:33:44.600,00:33:49.010
"And part three will be
about bases for them.",00:33:49.010,00:33:54.640
Orthogonal bases.,00:33:54.640,00:33:57.290
So that's coming up.,00:33:57.290,00:34:00.520
OK.,00:34:00.520,00:34:01.570
"So I'm happy with that
geometry right now.",00:34:01.570,00:34:10.870
OK.,00:34:10.870,00:34:11.980
OK.,00:34:11.980,00:34:12.949
"Now what's my next
goal in this chapter?",00:34:12.949,00:34:16.239
"Here's the main
problem of the chapter.",00:34:16.239,00:34:19.087
"The main problem of the chapter
is -- so this is coming.",00:34:19.087,00:34:21.420
It's coming attraction.,00:34:21.420,00:34:22.378
"This is the very last
chapter that's about Ax=b.",00:34:22.378,00:34:37.160
"I would like to solve
that system of equations",00:34:44.030,00:34:48.690
when there is no solution.,00:34:48.690,00:34:50.710
"You may say what a
ridiculous thing to do.",00:34:54.560,00:34:56.880
"But I have to say it's
done all the time.",00:34:56.880,00:35:00.670
In fact it has to be done.,00:35:00.670,00:35:02.440
"You get -- so the
problem is solve --",00:35:02.440,00:35:07.510
"the best possible solve I'll
put quote Ax=b when there is no",00:35:07.510,00:35:20.626
solution.,00:35:20.626,00:35:21.125
"And of course what
does that mean?",00:35:24.470,00:35:25.930
b isn't in the column space.,00:35:25.930,00:35:29.550
"And it's quite typical if this
matrix A is rectangular if I --",00:35:29.550,00:35:35.720
"maybe I have m equations and
that's bigger than the number",00:35:35.720,00:35:40.370
"of unknowns, then for
sure the rank is not m,",00:35:40.370,00:35:47.840
"the rank couldn't be m now, so
there'll be a lot of right-hand",00:35:47.840,00:35:51.910
"sides with no solution,
but here's an example.",00:35:51.910,00:36:00.300
Some satellite is buzzing along.,00:36:00.300,00:36:02.760
You measure its position.,00:36:02.760,00:36:06.196
"You make a thousand
measurements.",00:36:06.196,00:36:07.570
"So that gives you a thousand
equations for the --",00:36:10.190,00:36:13.940
"for the parameters that
-- that give the position.",00:36:13.940,00:36:18.340
"But there aren't a
thousand parameters,",00:36:18.340,00:36:20.350
"there's just maybe
six or something.",00:36:20.350,00:36:23.310
"Or you're measuring the --
you're doing questionnaires.",00:36:23.310,00:36:26.930
You're measuring resistances.,00:36:29.690,00:36:36.210
You're taking pulses.,00:36:36.210,00:36:37.650
"You're measuring
somebody's pulse rate.",00:36:37.650,00:36:41.120
There's just one unknown.,00:36:41.120,00:36:42.190
OK.,00:36:42.190,00:36:42.690
The pulse rate.,00:36:42.690,00:36:44.890
"So you measure it
once, OK, fine,",00:36:44.890,00:36:46.950
"but if you really
want to know it,",00:36:46.950,00:36:49.510
"you measure it multiple times,
but then the measurements have",00:36:49.510,00:36:54.800
"noise in them, so there's --",00:36:54.800,00:36:57.120
"the problem is that
in many many problems",00:36:57.120,00:36:59.820
"we've got too many
equations and they've got",00:36:59.820,00:37:03.740
noise in the right-hand side.,00:37:03.740,00:37:05.240
"So Ax=b I can't expect to
solve it exactly right,",00:37:05.240,00:37:11.780
"because I don't
even know what --",00:37:11.780,00:37:13.230
"there's a measurement
mistake in b.",00:37:13.230,00:37:18.680
But there's information too.,00:37:18.680,00:37:21.790
"There's a lot of information
about x in there.",00:37:21.790,00:37:25.120
"And what I want to do is like
separate the noise, the junk,",00:37:25.120,00:37:30.070
from the information.,00:37:30.070,00:37:33.860
"And so this is a straightforward
linear algebra problem.",00:37:33.860,00:37:38.680
"How do I solve, what's
the best solution?",00:37:38.680,00:37:41.600
OK.,00:37:41.600,00:37:43.600
Now.,00:37:43.600,00:37:45.070
"I want to say so that's
like describes the problem",00:37:45.070,00:37:52.190
in an algebraic way.,00:37:52.190,00:37:55.010
"I got some equations, I'm
looking for the best solution.",00:37:55.010,00:37:58.820
"Well, one way to find it
is -- one way to start,",00:37:58.820,00:38:02.020
"one way to find a solution
is throw away equations until",00:38:02.020,00:38:09.580
"you've got a nice, square
invertible system and solve",00:38:09.580,00:38:12.340
that.,00:38:12.340,00:38:14.760
That's not satisfactory.,00:38:14.760,00:38:18.620
"There's no reason in
these measurements",00:38:18.620,00:38:21.410
"to say these
measurements are perfect",00:38:21.410,00:38:23.300
"and these measurements
are useless.",00:38:23.300,00:38:25.970
"We want to use all
the measurements",00:38:25.970,00:38:27.990
"to get the best information,
to get the maximum information.",00:38:27.990,00:38:32.140
But how?,00:38:32.140,00:38:33.170
OK.,00:38:33.170,00:38:34.390
"Let me anticipate a matrix
that's going to show up.",00:38:34.390,00:38:40.020
This A is typically rectangular.,00:38:40.020,00:38:43.720
"But a matrix that shows
up whenever you have --",00:38:43.720,00:38:47.390
"and we chapter three was all
about rectangular matrices.",00:38:47.390,00:38:52.260
"And we know when
this is solvable,",00:38:52.260,00:38:54.840
"you could do elimination
on it, right?",00:38:54.840,00:38:58.020
"But I'm thinking hey,
you do elimination",00:38:58.020,00:39:00.600
"and you get equation zero
equal other non-zeroes.",00:39:00.600,00:39:03.299
"I'm thinking we really --
elimination is going to fail.",00:39:03.299,00:39:05.590
So that's our question.,00:39:05.590,00:39:05.630
"Elimination will
get us down to --",00:39:05.630,00:39:07.046
"will tell us if there
is a solution or not.",00:39:16.320,00:39:18.700
But I'm now thinking not.,00:39:18.700,00:39:22.600
So what are we going to do?,00:39:22.600,00:39:24.130
OK.,00:39:24.130,00:39:24.720
All right.,00:39:24.720,00:39:25.320
"I want to tell you to jump
ahead to the matrix that",00:39:25.320,00:39:30.810
will play a key role.,00:39:30.810,00:39:32.310
"So this is the matrix that
you want to understand",00:39:32.310,00:39:35.780
for this chapter four.,00:39:35.780,00:39:38.950
"And it's the matrix
A transpose A.",00:39:38.950,00:39:47.740
"What's -- tell me some
things about that matrix.",00:39:47.740,00:39:53.130
"So A is this m by n matrix,
rectangular, but now",00:39:53.130,00:39:58.640
"I'm saying that the good
matrix that shows up in the end",00:39:58.640,00:40:03.100
is A transpose A.,00:40:03.100,00:40:05.130
So tell me something about that.,00:40:05.130,00:40:09.120
"Is it -- what's the first thing
you know about A transpose A.",00:40:09.120,00:40:14.010
It's square.,00:40:14.010,00:40:15.390
Right?,00:40:15.390,00:40:16.780
"Square because this is m
by n and this is n by m.",00:40:16.780,00:40:21.740
So this is the result is n by n.,00:40:21.740,00:40:24.090
Good.,00:40:24.090,00:40:25.240
Square.,00:40:25.240,00:40:26.230
What else?,00:40:26.230,00:40:27.990
It's symmetric.,00:40:27.990,00:40:28.970
Good.,00:40:28.970,00:40:29.535
It's symmetric.,00:40:29.535,00:40:30.160
"Because you remember
how to do that.",00:40:35.920,00:40:39.650
"If we transpose that
matrix let's transpose it,",00:40:39.650,00:40:44.270
"A transpose A, if
I transpose it,",00:40:44.270,00:40:48.510
"then that comes first
transposed, this comes second,",00:40:48.510,00:40:55.230
"transposed, and then transposing
twice is leaves it --",00:40:55.230,00:41:01.990
"brings it back to the
same so it's symmetric.",00:41:01.990,00:41:05.100
Good.,00:41:05.100,00:41:06.620
"Now we now know how to
ask more about a matrix.",00:41:06.620,00:41:11.340
"I'm interested in
is it invertible?",00:41:14.050,00:41:20.110
"If not, what's its null space?",00:41:20.110,00:41:23.810
"So I want to know about --
because you're going to see,",00:41:23.810,00:41:26.940
"well, let me -- let me even,
well I shouldn't do this,",00:41:26.940,00:41:32.260
but I will.,00:41:32.260,00:41:33.350
"Let me tell you what
equation to solve",00:41:33.350,00:41:37.460
when you can't solve that one.,00:41:37.460,00:41:42.300
"The good equation comes
from multiplying both sides",00:41:42.300,00:41:47.450
"by A transpose, so the good
equation that you get to",00:41:47.450,00:41:53.150
is this one.,00:41:53.150,00:41:54.820
"A transpose Ax
equals A transpose b.",00:41:54.820,00:42:00.790
"That will be the central
equation in the chapter.",00:42:04.960,00:42:08.700
"So I think why not
tell it to you.",00:42:08.700,00:42:10.950
Why not admit it right away.,00:42:10.950,00:42:13.290
OK.,00:42:13.290,00:42:14.440
I have to --,00:42:14.440,00:42:15.260
I should really give x.,00:42:15.260,00:42:17.960
"I want to sort of indicate that
this x isn't I mean this x was",00:42:17.960,00:42:27.750
"the solution to that
equation if it existed,",00:42:27.750,00:42:30.580
but probably didn't.,00:42:30.580,00:42:33.440
"Now let me give this a
different name, x hat.",00:42:33.440,00:42:39.020
"Because I'm hoping this
one will have a solution.",00:42:39.020,00:42:45.740
"And I'm saying that
it's my best solution.",00:42:45.740,00:42:49.680
"I'll have to say
what does best mean.",00:42:49.680,00:42:52.400
"But that's going to
be my -- my plan.",00:42:52.400,00:42:55.720
"I'm going to say that the best
solution solves this equation.",00:42:55.720,00:42:59.650
"So you see right away why I'm
so interested in this matrix",00:42:59.650,00:43:03.770
A transpose A.,00:43:03.770,00:43:05.620
And in its invertibility.,00:43:05.620,00:43:07.130
OK.,00:43:07.130,00:43:07.630
"Now, when is it invertible?",00:43:10.210,00:43:11.720
OK.,00:43:14.290,00:43:14.900
"Let me take a case, let me
just do an example and then --",00:43:14.900,00:43:22.040
I'll just pick a matrix here.,00:43:22.040,00:43:25.910
"Just so we see what A
transpose A looks like.",00:43:25.910,00:43:28.510
"So let me take a matrix A
one, one, one, one, two, five.",00:43:28.510,00:43:35.010
Just to invent a matrix.,00:43:35.010,00:43:37.190
So there's a matrix A.,00:43:37.190,00:43:40.600
"Notice that it has M equal three
rows and N equal two columns.",00:43:40.600,00:43:48.390
Its rank is --,00:43:48.390,00:43:50.950
the rank of that matrix is two.,00:43:50.950,00:43:55.200
"Right, yeah, the
columns are independent.",00:43:55.200,00:43:58.460
Does Ax equal b?,00:43:58.460,00:44:01.200
"If I look at Ax=b, so x is
just x1 x2, and b is b1 b2 b3.",00:44:01.200,00:44:09.086
Do I expect to solve Ax=b?,00:44:12.700,00:44:15.300
"What's -- no way, right?",00:44:15.300,00:44:17.760
"I mean linear algebra's
great, but solving",00:44:17.760,00:44:21.440
"three equations with
only two unknowns usually",00:44:21.440,00:44:24.040
we can't do it.,00:44:24.040,00:44:26.020
"We can only solve it if
this vector is b is what?",00:44:26.020,00:44:30.050
"I can solve that equation
if that vector b1 b2 b3",00:44:33.230,00:44:37.780
is in the column space.,00:44:37.780,00:44:41.700
"If it's a combination of
those columns then fine.",00:44:41.700,00:44:44.650
But usually it won't be.,00:44:44.650,00:44:47.030
"The combinations
just fill up a plane",00:44:47.030,00:44:49.580
"and most vectors
aren't on that plane.",00:44:49.580,00:44:52.780
"So what I'm saying is
that I'm going to work",00:44:52.780,00:44:56.630
with the matrix A transpose A.,00:44:56.630,00:44:59.990
"And I just want to figure
out in this example what",00:44:59.990,00:45:03.600
A transpose A is.,00:45:03.600,00:45:07.780
So it's two by two.,00:45:07.780,00:45:09.390
"The first entry is a three,
the next entry is an eight,",00:45:09.390,00:45:13.320
this entry is --,00:45:13.320,00:45:15.160
what's that entry?,00:45:18.040,00:45:20.910
"Eight, for sure.",00:45:20.910,00:45:23.110
"We knew it had to
be, and this entry",00:45:23.110,00:45:25.270
"is, what's that now, getting out
my trusty calculator, thirty,",00:45:25.270,00:45:32.630
is that right?,00:45:32.630,00:45:35.880
And is that matrix invertible?,00:45:35.880,00:45:37.580
Thirty.,00:45:37.580,00:45:38.080
There's an A transpose A.,00:45:38.080,00:45:40.960
"And it is invertible, right?",00:45:40.960,00:45:42.620
"Three, eight is not a
multiple of eight, thirty --",00:45:42.620,00:45:46.040
and it's invertible.,00:45:46.040,00:45:48.050
"And that's the normal,
that's what I expect.",00:45:48.050,00:45:51.420
So this is I want to show.,00:45:51.420,00:45:56.730
"So here's the final --
here's the key point.",00:45:56.730,00:45:59.740
"The null space of
A transpose A --",00:45:59.740,00:46:04.660
"it's not going to be
always invertible.",00:46:04.660,00:46:06.645
Tell me a matrix --,00:46:09.650,00:46:11.450
"I have to say that I can't
say A transpose A is always",00:46:11.450,00:46:15.640
invertible.,00:46:15.640,00:46:16.770
Because that's asking too much.,00:46:16.770,00:46:19.590
"I mean what could the
matrix A be, for example,",00:46:19.590,00:46:22.860
"so that A transpose
A was not invertible?",00:46:22.860,00:46:27.330
"Well, it even could
be the zero matrix.",00:46:27.330,00:46:29.110
I mean that's like extreme case.,00:46:29.110,00:46:32.250
Suppose I make this rank --,00:46:32.250,00:46:38.960
suppose I change to that A.,00:46:38.960,00:46:46.090
"Now I figure out A transpose
A again and I get --",00:46:46.090,00:46:49.240
what do I get?,00:46:49.240,00:46:49.840
"I get nine, I get nine
of course and here I",00:46:53.890,00:46:58.360
get what's that entry?,00:46:58.360,00:47:02.434
Twenty-seven.,00:47:02.434,00:47:02.975
And is that matrix invertible?,00:47:06.900,00:47:09.100
No.,00:47:09.100,00:47:09.600
And why do I --,00:47:12.110,00:47:13.470
"I knew it wouldn't
be invertible anyway.",00:47:13.470,00:47:16.590
"Because this matrix
only has rank one.",00:47:16.590,00:47:23.190
"And if I have a product
of matrices of rank one,",00:47:23.190,00:47:26.100
"the product is not going to
have a rank bigger than one.",00:47:26.100,00:47:30.340
"So I'm not surprised that
the answer only has rank one.",00:47:30.340,00:47:33.810
And that's what I --,00:47:33.810,00:47:36.730
"always happens, that the
rank of A transpose A",00:47:36.730,00:47:41.200
"comes out to equal
the rank of A.",00:47:41.200,00:47:44.460
"So, yes, so the null
space of A transpose A",00:47:44.460,00:47:49.580
"equals the null space of A,
the rank of A transpose A",00:47:49.580,00:47:57.580
equals the rank of A.,00:47:57.580,00:48:01.840
"So let's -- as soon as
I can why that's true.",00:48:01.840,00:48:11.460
"But let's draw from that
what the fact that I want.",00:48:11.460,00:48:18.920
"This tells me that this square
symmetric matrix is invertible",00:48:18.920,00:48:24.810
if --,00:48:24.810,00:48:26.650
so here's my conclusion.,00:48:26.650,00:48:30.460
"A transpose A is invertible
if exactly when --",00:48:30.460,00:48:40.400
"exactly if this null space
is only got the zero vector.",00:48:40.400,00:48:46.390
"Which means the columns
of A are independent.",00:48:46.390,00:48:51.700
"So A transpose A is
invertible exactly",00:48:51.700,00:48:54.342
if A has independent columns.,00:48:54.342,00:48:55.550
"That's the fact that I
need about A transpose A.",00:48:55.550,00:49:12.290
"And then you'll see next
time how A transpose A",00:49:12.290,00:49:17.160
enters everything.,00:49:17.160,00:49:18.780
"Next lecture is
actually a crucial one.",00:49:18.780,00:49:22.130
"Here I'm preparing
for it by getting us",00:49:22.130,00:49:26.280
thinking about A transpose A.,00:49:26.280,00:49:29.000
"And its rank is the
same as the rank of A,",00:49:29.000,00:49:31.970
"and we can decide
when it's invertible.",00:49:31.970,00:49:34.310
OK.,00:49:34.310,00:49:34.980
So I'll see you Friday.,00:49:34.980,00:49:35.938
Thanks.,00:49:35.938,00:49:37.140
