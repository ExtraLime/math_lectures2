&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: All right.,00:00:11.100,00:00:11.490
So welcome back.,00:00:11.490,00:00:12.170
"This is CS50, and the is
the end of week three.",00:00:12.170,00:00:15.180
"&gt;&gt; So recall in the past several weeks,
we've been spending quite a bit of",00:00:15.180,00:00:17.770
"time on C, on programming, on syntax.",00:00:17.770,00:00:20.820
"And it's quite normal, if you're still
struggling with Problem Set 2, to be",00:00:20.820,00:00:24.680
banging your head against the wall.,00:00:24.680,00:00:25.950
"It's cryptic-looking error messages
and bugs that you",00:00:25.950,00:00:28.310
can't quite chase down.,00:00:28.310,00:00:29.220
"Because, rest assured, that in just a
few weeks' time you'll look back on",00:00:29.220,00:00:32.310
"things like Caesar, and [? V-genair, ?]
maybe even Crack, and",00:00:32.310,00:00:35.930
"realize just how far you've come
in a short period of time.",00:00:35.930,00:00:40.050
"So if that's any consolation,
hang in there for now.",00:00:40.050,00:00:43.670
"&gt;&gt; Today, though, we begin to transition
to things higher level.",00:00:43.670,00:00:46.610
"And we start to take for granted that
you guys know how to program, or at",00:00:46.610,00:00:49.820
"least the beginnings of
that comfort level.",00:00:49.820,00:00:52.090
"And we'll start to consider how we can
go about designing programs more",00:00:52.090,00:00:56.520
effectively.,00:00:56.520,00:00:57.440
"How we can go about optimizing the
efficiency of our algorithms, and",00:00:57.440,00:01:01.090
"generally solving more
interesting problems.",00:01:01.090,00:01:03.110
"And starting to take for granted that,
if we wanted to, we could code up any",00:01:03.110,00:01:06.850
of the examples we have in mind.,00:01:06.850,00:01:08.350
"So today, we don't touch the keyboard
for any form of code.",00:01:08.350,00:01:11.430
"It'll be much higher level, and
ultimately, about problem-solving.",00:01:11.430,00:01:15.150
"&gt;&gt; So to get to that point, let me propose
that the following seven",00:01:15.150,00:01:20.490
"rectangles represent seven doors, behind
which are a whole bunch of",00:01:20.490,00:01:24.290
"numbers, among which is the number 50.",00:01:24.290,00:01:26.340
"Let me project this on this
screen here as well.",00:01:26.340,00:01:30.470
"And propose that we need a volunteer to
help find me a number in front of",00:01:30.470,00:01:36.770
the internet here to see.,00:01:36.770,00:01:38.140
"Come on up, in the pink.",00:01:38.140,00:01:40.755
All right.,00:01:40.755,00:01:43.050
What's your name?,00:01:43.050,00:01:43.930
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: [INAUDIBLE],00:01:43.930,00:01:44.850
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Sorry?,00:01:44.850,00:01:45.170
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Jennifer.,00:01:45.170,00:01:45.860
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Jennifer.,00:01:45.860,00:01:46.390
"All right, Jennifer.",00:01:46.390,00:01:46.980
Nice to meet you.,00:01:46.980,00:01:47.630
Come on up.,00:01:47.630,00:01:48.370
"So these here are seven doors, and what
I'd like you to do for us here,",00:01:48.370,00:01:52.430
"in front of all of your classmates,
is find us the number, 50.",00:01:52.430,00:01:56.560
"To find a number, you can peek behind
any of these doors by simply tapping",00:01:56.560,00:02:00.860
"on one of the doors, and it
will reveal its number.",00:02:00.860,00:02:03.030
"And let's see how quickly you
can find us the number, 50.",00:02:03.030,00:02:06.080
&gt;&gt; 15.,00:02:09.979,00:02:11.229
16.,00:02:13.110,00:02:14.360
50.,00:02:16.270,00:02:16.530
Nicely done.,00:02:16.530,00:02:17.350
All right.,00:02:17.350,00:02:18.040
Round of applause for Jennifer.,00:02:18.040,00:02:19.906
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE],00:02:19.906,00:02:21.530
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:02:21.530,00:02:22.320
"So what was your strategy for
finding the number, 50?",00:02:22.320,00:02:25.254
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Um, I thought maybe if--",00:02:25.254,00:02:27.222
[INAUDIBLE],00:02:27.222,00:02:27.714
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Oh.,00:02:27.714,00:02:28.206
Give it one second.,00:02:28.206,00:02:29.630
"So was your strategy for
finding the number, 50?",00:02:29.630,00:02:32.420
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: So I just start at the
beginning to see what the first number",00:02:32.420,00:02:34.760
"was, and then I thought, maybe if
they're sorted, I'll just keep",00:02:34.760,00:02:38.590
tapping higher up?,00:02:38.590,00:02:39.970
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK.,00:02:39.970,00:02:40.140
"And we seem to have found
that to be the case.",00:02:40.140,00:02:42.910
"Although, let's peel back the layers
just a little bit, and you want to go",00:02:42.910,00:02:45.670
"ahead and reveal the other doors
you could have chosen?",00:02:45.670,00:02:47.640
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Oh, dear.",00:02:50.400,00:02:51.712
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Ah.,00:02:51.712,00:02:53.128
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: So I just got lucky.,00:02:53.128,00:02:54.280
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: So you got lucky.,00:02:54.280,00:02:55.270
All right.,00:02:55.270,00:02:55.710
So not bad.,00:02:55.710,00:02:56.795
"But that's an interesting
insight, right?",00:02:56.795,00:02:58.750
"If you assumed, and you did get,
indeed, a bit lucky there.",00:02:58.750,00:03:01.870
"But if you assumed that the numbers were
sorted, can you be more precise",00:03:01.870,00:03:05.350
"as to how that influenced
your behavior?",00:03:05.350,00:03:08.750
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: So if they were sorted, I
thought maybe smallest to largest.",00:03:08.750,00:03:11.715
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK.,00:03:11.715,00:03:11.970
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Or if this ended up being
really big, then largest to smallest.",00:03:11.970,00:03:15.260
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK.,00:03:15.260,00:03:15.540
"So largest to smallest, or
smallest to largest.",00:03:15.540,00:03:18.170
"But let me propose, suppose you had
gotten unlucky, and suppose that they",00:03:18.170,00:03:21.990
"were not, in fact, sorted, how many of
those doors might you have had to peek",00:03:21.990,00:03:26.840
behind in that worst case?,00:03:26.840,00:03:28.590
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: All of them.,00:03:28.590,00:03:29.860
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: All of them.,00:03:29.860,00:03:30.420
So let's generalize that as n.,00:03:30.420,00:03:31.740
"There happens to be 7, but let's more
generally say there's n doors on the",00:03:31.740,00:03:34.790
screen here.,00:03:34.790,00:03:35.650
"So in the worst case, you would have
to look behind 7 doors, or n doors.",00:03:35.650,00:03:40.110
"And so this really is, it's a bit of
luck today, but it's really a linear",00:03:40.110,00:03:44.140
"algorithm of sorts, even though you
were kind of skipping around.",00:03:44.140,00:03:46.440
Is that fair?,00:03:46.440,00:03:47.080
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Yeah.,00:03:47.080,00:03:47.500
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Well, let me see if your
strategy changes if I move us to",00:03:47.500,00:03:50.000
"our second example here with
7 different doors.",00:03:50.000,00:03:52.190
"Same numbers, but this
time they are sorted.",00:03:52.190,00:03:55.240
"What's your strategy here going to be,
trying to put out of your mind what",00:03:55.240,00:03:58.350
the other numbers were--,00:03:58.350,00:03:59.310
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: OK.,00:03:59.310,00:03:59.930
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: --earlier?,00:03:59.930,00:04:02.290
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Let's start
with the first one.",00:04:02.290,00:04:03.180
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: All right.,00:04:03.180,00:04:03.540
Start with the first one.,00:04:03.540,00:04:05.190
4.,00:04:05.190,00:04:05.960
"Now where you going to go, and why?",00:04:05.960,00:04:08.810
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: 4 is really small.,00:04:08.810,00:04:10.040
"So if they're sort maybe smallest
to largest, it should",00:04:10.040,00:04:12.500
"be twice that, and--.",00:04:12.500,00:04:13.290
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK.,00:04:13.290,00:04:13.670
"Let's see, which you think?",00:04:13.670,00:04:15.990
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Try the last one.,00:04:15.990,00:04:19.050
Nice.,00:04:19.050,00:04:19.500
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Very nicely done.,00:04:19.500,00:04:20.880
All right.,00:04:20.880,00:04:21.860
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE],00:04:21.860,00:04:23.010
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK.,00:04:23.010,00:04:24.310
"So you're actually doing this
horribly, because you're",00:04:24.310,00:04:26.790
doing it very well.,00:04:26.790,00:04:27.700
"Which leaves us unable to
make certain points.",00:04:27.700,00:04:31.150
So let's try to roll back here.,00:04:31.150,00:04:32.565
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: OK.,00:04:32.565,00:04:34.560
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Very well
done, nonetheless.",00:04:34.560,00:04:35.980
"So you started at the beginning,
you saw that it was 4, then you",00:04:35.980,00:04:39.060
moved to the end.,00:04:39.060,00:04:40.240
"But suppose you didn't get lucky
there, and suppose 50",00:04:40.240,00:04:42.320
was somewhere else.,00:04:42.320,00:04:42.890
What your third step have been?,00:04:42.890,00:04:46.190
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Go back to the beginning.,00:04:46.190,00:04:47.680
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Go back
to the beginning.",00:04:47.680,00:04:48.320
"OK, so you would've touched
this door, which was 8.",00:04:48.320,00:04:51.320
All right.,00:04:51.320,00:04:51.660
So that's not 50.,00:04:51.660,00:04:52.650
Where would you have looked next?,00:04:52.650,00:04:55.380
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: If I didn't
know they sorted.",00:04:55.380,00:04:56.720
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Correct.,00:04:56.720,00:04:57.005
"Well, if you did know
they were sorted--",00:04:57.005,00:04:58.490
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Oh, did know, yeah.",00:04:58.490,00:04:58.700
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: --but you didn't
know where 50 was yet?",00:04:58.700,00:05:00.910
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Just keep going.,00:05:00.910,00:05:01.785
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: All right.,00:05:01.785,00:05:02.130
OK.,00:05:02.130,00:05:02.520
Keep going.,00:05:02.520,00:05:03.800
"OK, that I can work with.",00:05:03.800,00:05:05.270
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: OK.,00:05:05.270,00:05:05.610
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Now, if you're just
going to keep going, what's your",00:05:05.610,00:05:07.210
algorithm devolving backed into.,00:05:07.210,00:05:09.680
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: The linear--.,00:05:09.680,00:05:10.740
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: It is kind of linear.,00:05:10.740,00:05:11.820
"But let me propose, let
me put on the spot.",00:05:11.820,00:05:13.480
Let me refresh the page.,00:05:13.480,00:05:14.900
"same number, same arrangement,
same doors.",00:05:14.900,00:05:17.120
"But think back to that first day in
class when we tore a phone book in",00:05:17.120,00:05:21.350
"half, sort of, and what was
our strategy there?",00:05:21.350,00:05:25.480
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Start at the middle.,00:05:25.480,00:05:26.450
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK.,00:05:26.450,00:05:26.690
So start at the middle.,00:05:26.690,00:05:27.610
So let's go ahead and simulate that.,00:05:27.610,00:05:28.790
"Start at the middle by
revealing that door.",00:05:28.790,00:05:30.720
So the number 16.,00:05:30.720,00:05:31.660
"So what would the strong guy have done,
who tore the phone book in half,",00:05:31.660,00:05:35.290
to get to the next guess?,00:05:35.290,00:05:38.450
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Go in this half.,00:05:38.450,00:05:39.400
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: And why to the right?,00:05:39.400,00:05:41.700
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: If they were sort of smallest
to largest, then 50 should be",00:05:41.700,00:05:43.900
at that end.,00:05:43.900,00:05:44.720
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Good.,00:05:44.720,00:05:44.920
Totally reasonable.,00:05:44.920,00:05:45.390
"So like a phone book, you go to the
right as opposed to the left, but here",00:05:45.390,00:05:48.380
is the key takeaway.,00:05:48.380,00:05:49.500
"You now can throw away, or tear off,
half of this problem, leaving you not",00:05:49.500,00:05:53.930
"with 7 doors, but really with just 3.",00:05:53.930,00:05:55.970
"Which is roughly half of the
size of the problem.",00:05:55.970,00:05:57.870
All right.,00:05:57.870,00:05:58.350
"So now what you would have
done after you go right?",00:05:58.350,00:06:01.890
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: So 16 is still pretty small,
relative to 50, so maybe I'll try,",00:06:01.890,00:06:05.870
"like, this one.",00:06:05.870,00:06:06.700
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: All right.,00:06:06.700,00:06:07.890
42.,00:06:07.890,00:06:08.720
"All right, so now what's your
instinct telling you?",00:06:08.720,00:06:10.830
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: I can throw away
this and then just--",00:06:10.830,00:06:12.100
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK.,00:06:12.100,00:06:12.360
"Good, you can throw away
the left half there.",00:06:12.360,00:06:14.212
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: --pick this one.,00:06:14.212,00:06:14.890
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: And the right.,00:06:14.890,00:06:15.530
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Yeah.,00:06:15.530,00:06:15.760
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: So even though it's hard
to see perhaps, when there's only",00:06:15.760,00:06:17.820
"7 doors, think about, now,
the consistency of the",00:06:17.820,00:06:21.320
algorithm you just applied.,00:06:21.320,00:06:22.620
"In the previous case, you did
get lucky, which was great.",00:06:22.620,00:06:24.510
"But you did use a heuristic,
I would say.",00:06:24.510,00:06:26.540
"You used sort of your instincts, and
knowing it sorted, if it's pretty",00:06:26.540,00:06:29.150
"small at the beginning, obviously, we've
got to go more to the right.",00:06:29.150,00:06:31.600
"But in some sense, you got lucky,
because maybe this was the number 100,",00:06:31.600,00:06:34.990
and maybe 50 was more in the middle.,00:06:34.990,00:06:36.220
Maybe 50 was even over here.,00:06:36.220,00:06:37.910
"&gt;&gt; But what you did a little differently
this time was, you did the same thing",00:06:37.910,00:06:40.960
again and again.,00:06:40.960,00:06:42.150
"And I would argue that what you just
did, albeit influenced by the phone",00:06:42.150,00:06:45.310
"book example, is something much
more algorithmic, and much",00:06:45.310,00:06:48.100
less special cased.,00:06:48.100,00:06:49.930
Much less instinctive.,00:06:49.930,00:06:51.620
"So in the end of the day, how would
you describe the efficiency of the",00:06:51.620,00:06:57.160
"first algorithm, where you went
left to right, versus the",00:06:57.160,00:07:00.530
second algorithm here?,00:07:00.530,00:07:03.430
"&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: This one should, like, maybe
halve the time, or even more, yeah.",00:07:03.430,00:07:06.460
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK, maybe even more.",00:07:06.460,00:07:07.320
Let's push a little harder on that.,00:07:07.320,00:07:10.150
"What really, if we continue this
logic, we definitely halved the",00:07:10.150,00:07:13.030
"running time with this second algorithm
by throwing away half of the",00:07:13.030,00:07:15.830
"numbers, but what did we do on the next
iteration, when Jennifer revealed",00:07:15.830,00:07:18.470
the second number?,00:07:18.470,00:07:20.615
&gt;&gt; We halved the numbers of doors again.,00:07:20.615,00:07:22.830
"And then what did we do after that, if
there were more doors to play with?",00:07:22.830,00:07:25.270
"We would halve them, and again,
and again, and again.",00:07:25.270,00:07:27.520
"And this was just like you guys all
standing up at the first week of",00:07:27.520,00:07:30.420
"class, half of you sitting down, half
of you sitting down, half of you",00:07:30.420,00:07:33.000
"sitting down, until one lone
soul was standing.",00:07:33.000,00:07:35.440
"And we said that the running time of
that, the number of steps it took was",00:07:35.440,00:07:39.050
on the order of what?,00:07:39.050,00:07:40.430
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE],00:07:40.430,00:07:41.230
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: So log base 2 of n,
or just more simply, log of n.",00:07:41.230,00:07:43.970
So something logarithmic.,00:07:43.970,00:07:45.060
"And the graph wasn't a straight line
that just got worse and worse, it was",00:07:45.060,00:07:48.380
"this interesting curve that didn't
get so bad over time.",00:07:48.380,00:07:52.490
So let's hold on to this idea.,00:07:52.490,00:07:53.910
Let's thank Jennifer.,00:07:53.910,00:07:54.690
Thanks so much for coming on up.,00:07:54.690,00:07:56.150
"And, one sec.",00:07:56.150,00:07:57.400
"No desk lamps today, but we
do have CS50 stress balls.",00:08:00.170,00:08:02.925
&gt;&gt; JENNIFER: Yay.,00:08:02.925,00:08:03.420
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: All right, here.",00:08:03.420,00:08:04.410
"Thank you for incurring
the stress up here.",00:08:04.410,00:08:06.545
All right.,00:08:06.545,00:08:07.350
"So let's see if we can't now
formalize this a bit more.",00:08:07.350,00:08:10.620
"So again, what we just did was
essentially the same thing as we did",00:08:10.620,00:08:14.820
in that first week.,00:08:14.820,00:08:16.660
"But rather than end with just a linear
algorithm, which we depicted",00:08:16.660,00:08:23.780
"previously as this straight line,
whereby, if we put one more door on",00:08:23.780,00:08:27.210
"the screen, then Jennifer would
have had to look, potentially,",00:08:27.210,00:08:29.610
behind one more door.,00:08:29.610,00:08:30.600
"If we put two more doors, she might have
to look behind two more doors.",00:08:30.600,00:08:33.490
"&gt;&gt; And so, there was this linear
relationship between the size of the",00:08:33.490,00:08:35.990
"problem on, say, the x-axis, and
the amount of time it takes to",00:08:35.990,00:08:39.059
solve on the y.,00:08:39.059,00:08:40.440
"But the picture I was alluding to
earlier was this green line.",00:08:40.440,00:08:43.330
"Green deliberately, because
it just felt better.",00:08:43.330,00:08:45.970
"In theory, the algorithm, when we did it
with the phone book, when we did it",00:08:45.970,00:08:49.790
"with you guys counting each other, and
in the second case, when Jennifer just",00:08:49.790,00:08:52.420
"did it up here, it was sort
of fundamentally better.",00:08:52.420,00:08:55.250
Because it wasn't just twice as fast.,00:08:55.250,00:08:57.180
It wasn't even four times as fast.,00:08:57.180,00:08:58.870
"It was entirely dependent on what the
size of the input was, as to how many",00:08:58.870,00:09:03.290
steps it ultimately took.,00:09:03.290,00:09:05.220
"&gt;&gt; And so this simple idea that we all took
for granted with the phone book,",00:09:05.220,00:09:08.040
"can similarly be applied
to something like this.",00:09:08.040,00:09:10.200
"And this might be more casually
known as, as you might",00:09:10.200,00:09:12.380
"imagine, divide and conquer.",00:09:12.380,00:09:13.940
"Not unlike what we did, of course,
with the phone book.",00:09:13.940,00:09:16.390
"&gt;&gt; But the pseudocode, recall, was this.",00:09:16.390,00:09:18.300
"So we won't do this again, but recall
that first week, all of us stood up",00:09:18.300,00:09:21.800
"and then half of you sat down, half of
you sat down, half of you sat down.",00:09:21.800,00:09:25.140
"That algorithm was implemented in a
bit of a cheating way, in that, it",00:09:25.140,00:09:29.280
"wasn't just one of me counting,
fundamentally, more efficiently.",00:09:29.280,00:09:32.870
"In that case, I was leveraging
a secondary resource.",00:09:32.870,00:09:35.830
"Sort of, multiple CPUs, multiple brains,
multiple smart people in the",00:09:35.830,00:09:39.470
"room were helping me get from something
linear to something",00:09:39.470,00:09:42.740
"logarithmic, from something
red to something green.",00:09:42.740,00:09:45.190
"&gt;&gt; But in this case, Jennifer alone can
fundamentally improve upon the",00:09:45.190,00:09:48.650
"performance of her first algorithm by,
again, just thinking a little harder.",00:09:48.650,00:09:52.370
"And now, when it comes time to implement
these things, figuring out",00:09:52.370,00:09:56.650
"what lines of code you can write such
that you can repeat them again, and",00:09:56.650,00:10:00.670
"again, and again, sort of
in a looping fashion.",00:10:00.670,00:10:03.350
"Because you're not going to have the
luxury, like Jennifer did at first, to",00:10:03.350,00:10:06.370
"just have a whole bunch of ifs and say,
hmm, if this first number is 4,",00:10:06.370,00:10:10.460
let me jump all the way to the end.,00:10:10.460,00:10:11.800
"Ooh,if that number's too big,
let me move arbitrarily back",00:10:11.800,00:10:14.180
to the second element.,00:10:14.180,00:10:15.220
"You'll find that it's going to be a lot
harder to formalize what we humans",00:10:15.220,00:10:18.210
"take for granted as very reasonable
heuristics, but a computer is only",00:10:18.210,00:10:21.270
going to do what you tell it to do.,00:10:21.270,00:10:23.260
"&gt;&gt; Now this has very interesting
implications.",00:10:23.260,00:10:25.280
"This graph is sort of meant to sort of
overwhelm visually, but notice, where",00:10:25.280,00:10:29.950
is the straight line in this graph?,00:10:29.950,00:10:32.230
"Where is the linear graph
that we call n?",00:10:32.230,00:10:35.330
"Well, it's sort of toward the bottom
of this picture, right?",00:10:35.330,00:10:37.580
"So all we've done is we've sort of
zoomed out to the x-axis and the",00:10:37.580,00:10:40.500
"y-axis to try to get a sense of what
other types of curves look like.",00:10:40.500,00:10:44.780
"&gt;&gt; And the specifics of the mathematical
expressions today won't matter so",00:10:44.780,00:10:47.760
"much, but notice that there's a lot of
algorithms that are far worse than",00:10:47.760,00:10:52.440
something that's linear.,00:10:52.440,00:10:53.470
"Indeed, n cubed looks pretty bad.",00:10:53.470,00:10:55.410
"2 to the n looks pretty bad.
n squared looks pretty bad.",00:10:55.410,00:10:58.400
"And we'll see what some of those
might be in reality today.",00:10:58.400,00:11:01.630
"And log n doesn't feel as bad, but
better than n is log base 2 of n.",00:11:01.630,00:11:05.430
"But you know, it would have been even
more amazing if Jennifer, or if we,",00:11:05.430,00:11:08.080
"that first week, had come up with
something that's log of log of n.",00:11:08.080,00:11:12.910
"&gt;&gt; So in other words, there's this whole
range of possible solutions to",00:11:12.910,00:11:15.880
"problems, but even here, notice
what's going to happen.",00:11:15.880,00:11:18.570
"When I zoom out, which of these curves
is going to prove to be the absolute",00:11:18.570,00:11:22.910
worst of the ones on the screen now?,00:11:22.910,00:11:26.630
"So n cubed looks pretty
bad at the moment.",00:11:26.630,00:11:28.680
"But if we zoom out and see more of the
x and the y-axis, who's going to",00:11:28.680,00:11:32.470
dominate ultimately?,00:11:32.470,00:11:34.550
"So it actually turns out that 2 to the
n, and you can figure this out just by",00:11:34.550,00:11:37.120
"plugging in some increasingly large
numbers, and you'll see that 2 to the",00:11:37.120,00:11:39.990
"n, indeed, gets bigger much faster.",00:11:39.990,00:11:42.070
"If we really zoom out, a 2 to the
n algorithm absolutely sucks.",00:11:42.070,00:11:45.530
"I mean this is going to take
quite a bit of time for the",00:11:45.530,00:11:48.170
computer to churn through.,00:11:48.170,00:11:49.460
"&gt;&gt; But you'll see over time, especially
with future problem sets and even",00:11:49.460,00:11:52.500
"final projects, is your data
set gets large, all right?",00:11:52.500,00:11:55.600
"Even in the first version of Facebook,
as the number of friends, and the",00:11:55.600,00:11:58.300
"number of registered users got large,
you can sort of phone it in and",00:11:58.300,00:12:01.840
"implement something with linear search,
or a very simple sorting",00:12:01.840,00:12:05.530
"algorithm, as we'll see today.",00:12:05.530,00:12:07.030
"You have to start thinking harder
and harder about these problems.",00:12:07.030,00:12:09.280
"And the types of problems places like
Facebook, and Google, and Microsoft,",00:12:09.280,00:12:12.070
"and others work on is exactly these
sort of big data sort of questions",00:12:12.070,00:12:16.350
increasingly these days.,00:12:16.350,00:12:18.530
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:12:18.530,00:12:18.900
"So Jennifer's success in that second
algorithm, frankly, she did amazingly",00:12:18.900,00:12:23.800
"well the first time, but let's
write it as luck so that we",00:12:23.800,00:12:26.110
can make this point.,00:12:26.110,00:12:27.000
"In the second case, she leveraged an
algorithm that repeated again and",00:12:27.000,00:12:30.970
"again, but she took for granted a
certain assumption that we allowed",00:12:30.970,00:12:34.670
"her, but she exploited some detail the
second time that she didn't have the",00:12:34.670,00:12:39.370
first time.,00:12:39.370,00:12:39.840
Which was what?,00:12:39.840,00:12:41.800
&gt;&gt; That the list was sorted.,00:12:41.800,00:12:43.050
"So as soon as the list was sorted, we
claim that Jennifer was able to do",00:12:43.050,00:12:46.350
fundamentally better.,00:12:46.350,00:12:47.480
"7 doors, yes, is not that interesting,
but suppose it we're 7 million doors.",00:12:47.480,00:12:51.450
"Log of n is definitely going
to perform much, much",00:12:51.450,00:12:54.080
faster in the long run.,00:12:54.080,00:12:55.610
"But she had to have the
doors sorted for her.",00:12:55.610,00:12:58.880
"Now, I took the liberty of doing that
in advance on the computer screen",00:12:58.880,00:13:02.320
"here, but suppose that Jennifer
had to do that herself?",00:13:02.320,00:13:05.160
"Suppose that the doors in question
represented data in a database, or",00:13:05.160,00:13:10.120
"friends registered for Facebook, or
any web pages on the internet that",00:13:10.120,00:13:14.260
"various websites might need
to index or search over.",00:13:14.260,00:13:16.880
"&gt;&gt; Suppose that you just had a raw data
set and it was left to you, or to",00:13:16.880,00:13:20.940
Jennifer to do that sorting?,00:13:20.940,00:13:23.010
"That, rather, requires that we answer
the question, well, how much time",00:13:23.010,00:13:26.950
"would have taken Jennifer, or even me,
to sort those numbers in advance so",00:13:26.950,00:13:31.080
that she could take advantage of that?,00:13:31.080,00:13:32.680
Right?,00:13:32.680,00:13:32.880
"Because the implication, of course, is
if it takes me quite a while to sort",00:13:32.880,00:13:36.620
"the numbers, who the heck cares that you
can find a number like 50 so fast,",00:13:36.620,00:13:40.800
"as in Jennifer's case, if we more than
overwhelmed the amount of total time",00:13:40.800,00:13:44.850
it took by sorting things in advance?,00:13:44.850,00:13:46.920
"&gt;&gt; So let's see if we can't the
paint the picture here.",00:13:46.920,00:13:49.320
"I have a whole bunch more stress
balls, if that helps",00:13:49.320,00:13:51.370

I'm Branson.,00:15:14.620,00:15:15.620
I'm a freshman in Weld.,00:15:15.620,00:15:16.920

I'm Gabe.,00:15:20.230,00:15:21.040
I'm a junior in Cabot.,00:15:21.040,00:15:22.300
&gt;&gt; NEIL: I'm Neil.,00:15:24.826,00:15:25.980
I'm a freshman in Matthews.,00:15:25.980,00:15:29.090
&gt;&gt; JASON: I'm Jason.,00:15:29.090,00:15:29.550
I'm a freshman in Greenough.,00:15:29.550,00:15:32.816
&gt;&gt; MIKE : I'm Mike.,00:15:32.816,00:15:33.700
I'm a freshman in Grays.,00:15:33.700,00:15:37.360
&gt;&gt; JESS: I'm Jess.,00:15:37.360,00:15:37.990
I'm a sophomore in Leverett.,00:15:37.990,00:15:40.313
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Excellent.,00:15:40.313,00:15:41.300
All right.,00:15:41.300,00:15:41.850
"Well, thank you to all of our
volunteers here thus far.",00:15:41.850,00:15:44.190
"And the challenge at hand now is going
to be to sort of these guys, but then",00:15:44.190,00:15:47.110
"we're going to have to think a little
hard about how efficiently we actually",00:15:47.110,00:15:50.250
sorted them.,00:15:50.250,00:15:51.110
So let's first try this.,00:15:51.110,00:15:52.580
"You guys can see each other's numbers
just by placing around the corners.",00:15:52.580,00:15:55.970
"Go ahead and take a few seconds, and
sort yourselves from smallest on the",00:15:55.970,00:15:59.380
left to largest on the right.,00:15:59.380,00:16:01.240
Go.,00:16:01.240,00:16:02.490
&gt;&gt; OK.,00:16:07.010,00:16:07.530
Good.,00:16:07.530,00:16:08.030
That was really darn fast.,00:16:08.030,00:16:09.370
"Now someone here, what was the algorithm
that these guys applied?",00:16:09.370,00:16:14.040
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Least to greatest.,00:16:14.040,00:16:14.900
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK.,00:16:14.900,00:16:15.000
"Least to greatest is really sort of the
objective, but I'm not sure that's",00:16:15.000,00:16:18.070
really an algorithm.,00:16:18.070,00:16:18.890
"Least to greatest doesn't tell
me step-by-step what to do.",00:16:18.890,00:16:21.810
Yeah?,00:16:21.810,00:16:22.833
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE],00:16:22.833,00:16:24.083
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK.,00:16:26.010,00:16:26.280
"So if you see a person smaller than
your number, then move to",00:16:26.280,00:16:28.920
the right of them.,00:16:28.920,00:16:29.680
"So that's now getting more expressive,
more like an algorithm, because you",00:16:29.680,00:16:32.800
"can say, if this, then that.",00:16:32.800,00:16:35.410
"So we have some kind of
conditional construct.",00:16:35.410,00:16:37.050
"And these guys seemed to do that a few
times, because some of you moved a bit",00:16:37.050,00:16:39.700
of a distance.,00:16:39.700,00:16:40.420
"So there was presumably some kind of
looping going on in their minds.",00:16:40.420,00:16:43.410
&gt;&gt; But let's try to formalize that.,00:16:43.410,00:16:44.610
"If you guys could reset back
to this arrangement.",00:16:44.610,00:16:47.540
"Let's see if we can't formalize this a
bit, and then ask the question, just",00:16:47.540,00:16:50.650
how efficient is this?,00:16:50.650,00:16:51.580
"Of course, when we do this more slowly,
it's going to feel as good of",00:16:51.580,00:16:54.220
"an algorithm, but let's see if we can
put our fingers on the precise steps.",00:16:54.220,00:16:57.210
&gt;&gt; So you two guys are four and two.,00:16:57.210,00:16:58.670
Or you correct or incorrect order?,00:16:58.670,00:17:01.020
Obviously incorrect.,00:17:01.020,00:17:01.900
So we swapped.,00:17:01.900,00:17:02.710
"Now I'm going to move aside
here and say, four to six.",00:17:02.710,00:17:05.170
Are you correct or incorrect?,00:17:05.170,00:17:06.240
&gt;&gt; GABE: Correct.,00:17:06.240,00:17:06.599
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Correct.,00:17:06.599,00:17:07.180
Six and one?,00:17:07.180,00:17:08.300
Nope.,00:17:08.300,00:17:08.609
Swap.,00:17:08.609,00:17:09.630
So that's two swaps.,00:17:09.630,00:17:10.490
Six and three?,00:17:10.490,00:17:11.710
Nope.,00:17:11.710,00:17:11.980
Swap.,00:17:11.980,00:17:13.000
Six and seven?,00:17:13.000,00:17:13.930
Looks good.,00:17:13.930,00:17:14.630
Seven and five?,00:17:14.630,00:17:15.396
&gt;&gt; JESS: [INAUDIBLE],00:17:15.396,00:17:16.150
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: OK, swap.",00:17:16.150,00:17:17.089
And sorted.,00:17:17.089,00:17:19.770
All right.,00:17:19.770,00:17:19.980
"So obviously not, right?",00:17:19.980,00:17:21.440
So there was more going on.,00:17:21.440,00:17:22.470
"But, indeed, these guys, even
just instinctively.",00:17:22.470,00:17:24.920
kept moving.,00:17:24.920,00:17:25.450
"They didn't just stop, once they
corrected one problem.",00:17:25.450,00:17:27.710
So.,00:17:27.710,00:17:27.839
"Indeed, I'm going to have
to do the same thing.",00:17:27.839,00:17:29.390
"I'm going to have to sort of rewind back
to the beginning of this problem,",00:17:29.390,00:17:32.720
"or the beginning of this array of
people, let's start calling them.",00:17:32.720,00:17:35.630
"&gt;&gt; And now what should my algorithm
on the second pass be?",00:17:35.630,00:17:38.366
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Same thing.,00:17:38.366,00:17:39.220
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Same thing.,00:17:39.220,00:17:39.940
"And this, I'm starting to like, right?",00:17:39.940,00:17:41.460
"As soon as you can find yourself doing
the same thing again and again, that's",00:17:41.460,00:17:44.720
"becoming more like an algorithm,
and less human instinct.",00:17:44.720,00:17:47.890
"&gt;&gt; So now, here we go again.",00:17:47.890,00:17:48.680
Two and four?,00:17:48.680,00:17:49.870
No.,00:17:49.870,00:17:50.220
Four and one?,00:17:50.220,00:17:51.050
"Ah, there was indeed some
work still to be done.",00:17:51.050,00:17:53.380
For and three?,00:17:53.380,00:17:53.620
Good.,00:17:53.620,00:17:54.572
Four and six?,00:17:54.572,00:17:56.000
Six and five?,00:17:56.000,00:17:58.380
Six and seven?,00:17:58.380,00:17:59.470
"OK, now, done.",00:17:59.470,00:18:00.970
"OK, no.",00:18:00.970,00:18:01.550
I have to go back.,00:18:01.550,00:18:02.710
"&gt;&gt; So now, again, we're doing this
a little more deliberately.",00:18:02.710,00:18:05.130
"And now, there's just one brain
executing this algorithm.",00:18:05.130,00:18:08.700
"One CPU, if you will.",00:18:08.700,00:18:10.290
"And frankly, that's the only resource
we're going to have access to.",00:18:10.290,00:18:13.090
"And once we do go back to a keyboard
and have something like C at our",00:18:13.090,00:18:16.280
"disposal, we're only writing a program
that can do one thing at a time.",00:18:16.280,00:18:19.600
"Whereas, these guys a moment ago, we
leveraged their collective brainpower",00:18:19.600,00:18:22.900
like you guys did in week zero.,00:18:22.900,00:18:24.180
So let's keep doing this.,00:18:24.180,00:18:24.980
&gt;&gt; Two and one.,00:18:24.980,00:18:26.260
Two and three.,00:18:26.260,00:18:26.945
Three and four.,00:18:26.945,00:18:27.460
Four and five.,00:18:27.460,00:18:28.310
Five and six.,00:18:28.310,00:18:28.620
Six and seven.,00:18:28.620,00:18:30.510
Done?,00:18:30.510,00:18:31.880
"So I am, but let me play
devil's advocate.",00:18:31.880,00:18:34.560
"Do I, the sort of computer who just
made a pass through this array of",00:18:34.560,00:18:37.950
"people, know that I'm done?",00:18:37.950,00:18:40.225
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: No.,00:18:40.225,00:18:40.670
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: So why?,00:18:40.670,00:18:41.050
"What would I have to do in order to
conclude decisively that I am done?",00:18:41.050,00:18:46.900
Probably one more pass.,00:18:46.900,00:18:48.230
Right?,00:18:48.230,00:18:48.430
"Because all I know from that previous
pass is that I corrected a mistake.",00:18:48.430,00:18:51.760
"And that means, maybe there's
still another mistake",00:18:51.760,00:18:53.920
that I need to correct.,00:18:53.920,00:18:54.840
"So I can only be sure by rewinding, and
then checking, one to two, two and",00:18:54.840,00:18:58.680
"three, three and four, four and five,
five and six, six and seven.",00:18:58.680,00:19:00.940
"OK, now I did no work.",00:19:00.940,00:19:02.510
"&gt;&gt; I can certainly remember that I did no
work with something like a variable,",00:19:02.510,00:19:05.990
like an int.,00:19:05.990,00:19:06.975
"Call it swaps, and if swaps is 0 once I
get here, and it started at 0, then",00:19:06.975,00:19:12.490
"I would just be stupid to keep going
back and forth, checking again, and",00:19:12.490,00:19:15.520
"again, and again, right?",00:19:15.520,00:19:16.450
"Because you get stuck in some
kind of infinite loop.",00:19:16.450,00:19:18.450
"So as soon as there's 0 swaps,
we can claim that this",00:19:18.450,00:19:21.250
algorithm is indeed complete.,00:19:21.250,00:19:23.810
"&gt;&gt; Now, let's put a name on this.",00:19:23.810,00:19:25.400
"The algorithm that I propose we just
implemented is something called bubble",00:19:25.400,00:19:28.930
"sort, known as such in the sense that
the numbers that are bigger kind of",00:19:28.930,00:19:32.800
"bubble their way up to the top, or up
to the end of the array of numbers.",00:19:32.800,00:19:37.990
But how efficient was this algorithm?,00:19:37.990,00:19:40.270
"How many steps did I physically have to
take, for instance, to sort these",00:19:40.270,00:19:44.600
seven humans?,00:19:44.600,00:19:45.850
&gt;&gt; Four to five?,00:19:48.560,00:19:49.550
"OK, too many is ultimately
going to be the answer.",00:19:49.550,00:19:51.420
"But even then, the specific number
isn't so interesting.",00:19:51.420,00:19:54.960
Let's generalize it as n.,00:19:54.960,00:19:56.670
"So if I had n people up here, and they
were, sort of, in random order at the",00:19:56.670,00:20:00.520
"beginning, in that original order.",00:20:00.520,00:20:02.180
"Well, how many steps did I have
to take on the first pass?",00:20:02.180,00:20:04.910
"It was one, two, three, four, five,
six, and they're seven people, so",00:20:04.910,00:20:09.810
"that's seven, six--, so that's n
minus one steps the first time.",00:20:09.810,00:20:13.670
"&gt;&gt; Now, how many steps did I have
to take when I rewound?",00:20:13.670,00:20:16.280
"Well, we could actually double that if
we really wanted to, but for now, I'm",00:20:16.280,00:20:19.310
"just going to say, all right,
another n minus 1.",00:20:19.310,00:20:22.300
"So the n minus 1 is going to get
annoying to keep track of, so let's",00:20:22.300,00:20:25.240
just round up slightly.,00:20:25.240,00:20:26.400
So 2n steps.,00:20:26.400,00:20:27.770
"So 14 steps, give or take.",00:20:27.770,00:20:29.310
"&gt;&gt; How many times did I take
a step the next time?",00:20:29.310,00:20:31.930
"Well, it's 3n.",00:20:31.930,00:20:33.740
really.,00:20:33.740,00:20:34.510
"And now, in the worst case, for
instance, how many times would I have",00:20:34.510,00:20:37.920
"gone back and forth, back and forth,
executing this algorithm, swapping",00:20:37.920,00:20:41.730
"people on each pass, roughly?",00:20:41.730,00:20:44.620
"It's actually n squared, right?",00:20:47.720,00:20:50.010
"&gt;&gt; Because in the worst case, you can kind
of think about this intuitively,",00:20:50.010,00:20:53.000
"even though it might take a little
bit of time to sink in.",00:20:53.000,00:20:54.800
"In the worst case, what would these
seven people have looked like, in",00:20:54.800,00:20:57.590
"terms of the arrangement
of their numbers?",00:20:57.590,00:21:00.230
"Completely backwards, right?",00:21:00.230,00:21:01.460
"And just to simulate that,
what was your name again?",00:21:01.460,00:21:02.815
&gt;&gt; MIKE : Mike.,00:21:02.815,00:21:03.360
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Mike?,00:21:03.360,00:21:03.640
"OK, Mike, can you just join me over
here for just one second?",00:21:03.640,00:21:08.100
"Actually, no.",00:21:08.100,00:21:08.880
"Sorry Mike, let's rewind.",00:21:08.880,00:21:10.150
What's your name again?,00:21:10.150,00:21:10.910
&gt;&gt; NEIL: Neil.,00:21:10.910,00:21:11.180
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Neil.,00:21:11.180,00:21:11.640
"OK, Neil, you come with
me, if you don't mind.",00:21:11.640,00:21:13.750
"So I'm going to propose, just for
simplicity, that Neil is now in his",00:21:13.750,00:21:17.150
worst possible case.,00:21:17.150,00:21:18.510
"But recall how I implemented
my algorithm.",00:21:18.510,00:21:20.720
"I'm comparing, comparing, comparing,
comparing, comparing, oh.",00:21:20.720,00:21:24.530
"Now these guys are out
of order, so I fix.",00:21:24.530,00:21:26.640
So you guys swap.,00:21:26.640,00:21:27.980
"But consider now, how much farther
does Neil have to go?",00:21:27.980,00:21:31.630
It's roughly n.,00:21:31.630,00:21:32.690
"You know, it's not actually n.",00:21:32.690,00:21:33.570
"It's like, n minus 1, but I'm getting
annoyed keeping track of the little",00:21:33.570,00:21:36.040
"number, so let's just call it n.",00:21:36.040,00:21:37.550
"&gt;&gt; So if Neil moves one step maximally each
time, and to move Neil one step,",00:21:37.550,00:21:42.860
"I have to make this really tedious pass
back and forth, this is roughly",00:21:42.860,00:21:46.580
"doing this, n steps, a total of n times,
because it's going to take me",00:21:46.580,00:21:52.080
"that many steps to get Neil all
the way to where he belongs.",00:21:52.080,00:21:55.820
"Let alone everyone else if you guys
were all mis-ordered as well.",00:21:55.820,00:21:58.620
&gt;&gt; So let's call bubble sort n squared.,00:21:58.620,00:22:01.100
"The running time of this algorithm, the
performance of this algorithm, the",00:22:01.100,00:22:04.860
"efficiency of this algorithm,
we shall just describe more",00:22:04.860,00:22:07.120
generally as n squared.,00:22:07.120,00:22:08.800
"Which is nice, because I could do the
same example with eight people, nine",00:22:08.800,00:22:11.650
"people, a million people, and that
answer is not going to change.",00:22:11.650,00:22:15.450
"&gt;&gt; So if you guys wouldn't mind, let's
reset you to where you started.",00:22:15.450,00:22:18.870
"And let's try two other approaches and
see if we can't do fundamentally",00:22:18.870,00:22:22.510
better than this.,00:22:22.510,00:22:23.820
"So this time, I'm going to propose
a sort of different algorithm.",00:22:23.820,00:22:27.130
"That was very clever of us last time,
and you guys were right to have the",00:22:27.130,00:22:29.950
"right instincts of just kind
of swapping pairwise.",00:22:29.950,00:22:32.470
"But if I really wanted to approach this
simply, and my goal is to move",00:22:32.470,00:22:36.500
"all of the little numbers this way, and
push all of the big numbers that",00:22:36.500,00:22:39.800
"way, why don't I just do that in the
most naive way possible and see if I",00:22:39.800,00:22:43.030
"can do better than what was a
fairly complex algorithm?",00:22:43.030,00:22:45.730
&gt;&gt; So let's see.,00:22:45.730,00:22:46.620
"Four is a pretty small number, so I'm
going to leave you there moment.",00:22:46.620,00:22:48.940
"Ooh, number two is even better.",00:22:48.940,00:22:50.610
"So can you just step forward
for a moment?",00:22:50.610,00:22:52.230
"This is currently my smallest numbered
candidate, and I'm going to remember",00:22:52.230,00:22:55.670
"that with, like, a variable.",00:22:55.670,00:22:57.000
But I'm going to keep checking.,00:22:57.000,00:22:57.930
"Is there someone whose
number is smaller?",00:22:57.930,00:22:59.890
"Six, no.",00:22:59.890,00:23:00.460
"Oh, there's Neil again.",00:23:00.460,00:23:01.390
"&gt;&gt; So I'm going to push you back
sort of conceptually.",00:23:01.390,00:23:04.050
Neil will come forward.,00:23:04.050,00:23:05.120
"And now, the variable that I'm using to
keep track of who has the smallest",00:23:05.120,00:23:08.440
"number is updated to contain
Neil's location.",00:23:08.440,00:23:11.390
"Well, let's see.",00:23:11.390,00:23:12.110
"Three, seven, five.",00:23:12.110,00:23:13.960
"OK, I know Neil was the smallest.",00:23:13.960,00:23:15.590
"What's the simplest thing
for me to do now?",00:23:15.590,00:23:18.110
"I'm not going to waste my time by just
bubbling Neil one spot to the left.",00:23:18.110,00:23:21.410
"Why don't I just put Neil where he
belongs, which is of course where?",00:23:21.410,00:23:25.350
&gt;&gt; All the way at the beginning.,00:23:25.350,00:23:26.160
"So Neil, come with me.",00:23:26.160,00:23:27.720
And what was your name again?,00:23:27.720,00:23:28.910
&gt;&gt; GRACE: Grace.,00:23:28.910,00:23:29.310
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Grace.,00:23:29.310,00:23:29.710
OK.,00:23:29.710,00:23:29.920
"So Grace, unfortunately, you're
kind of in the way.",00:23:29.920,00:23:32.490
So how do we solve this problem?,00:23:32.490,00:23:34.290
Right?,00:23:34.290,00:23:34.490
"If this is an array, there's
only seven locations.",00:23:34.490,00:23:37.500
"Recall that, with Rob, we talked about
declaring ages, and we only had a",00:23:37.500,00:23:40.830
finite number of ages?,00:23:40.830,00:23:41.740
Same idea here.,00:23:41.740,00:23:42.535
We only have a finite number of ints.,00:23:42.535,00:23:44.300
"Grace is kind of in our
way, so how do we fix?",00:23:44.300,00:23:47.590
"&gt;&gt; The simplest way is like,
Grace, sorry.",00:23:47.590,00:23:49.555
"You're going to have to go over
there so we can make room.",00:23:49.555,00:23:51.870
"Now, if you think about this, maybe
we just made the problem worse.",00:23:51.870,00:23:55.290
"And maybe we did, because what if
Grace were in the right place?",00:23:55.290,00:23:58.510
"But we know she's not, because
otherwise, she would have been",00:23:58.510,00:24:01.730
"standing forward instead of
Neil at this time, right?",00:24:01.730,00:24:03.980
We already checked her number out.,00:24:03.980,00:24:05.550
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:24:05.550,00:24:05.770
"So now, Neil's in the right place, and
I can do a slight optimization.",00:24:05.770,00:24:09.110
"For the next minute, I'm going to ignore
Neil all together, so as not to",00:24:09.110,00:24:11.740
"waste his time, or accidentally
swap him to the wrong place.",00:24:11.740,00:24:15.280
"So now, how do I find the next
element that's smallest?",00:24:15.280,00:24:17.805
Two.,00:24:17.805,00:24:18.480
"That's a pretty good number, if
you want to step forward and",00:24:18.480,00:24:20.225
I'll remember you.,00:24:20.225,00:24:21.100
"Six, no good.",00:24:21.100,00:24:21.980
"Four, three, seven, five, no good.",00:24:21.980,00:24:24.820
"So let me move you to
your right place.",00:24:24.820,00:24:26.800
And we just got lucky this time.,00:24:26.800,00:24:28.470
"&gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to ignore these
two guys, and now do one more",00:24:28.470,00:24:31.350
pass through this.,00:24:31.350,00:24:32.260
"Six, that a pretty small number.",00:24:32.260,00:24:33.490
Come on forward.,00:24:33.490,00:24:34.300
"Oh, sorry.",00:24:34.300,00:24:35.220
"Grace's number is better,
so step on forward.",00:24:35.220,00:24:37.640
Four.,00:24:37.640,00:24:38.260
"Sorry, Grace.",00:24:38.260,00:24:39.120
Go back again.,00:24:39.120,00:24:39.950
Number three is better.,00:24:39.950,00:24:41.550
Seven.,00:24:41.550,00:24:42.290
Five.,00:24:42.290,00:24:42.720
And now what's your name again?,00:24:42.720,00:24:43.550
&gt;&gt; JASON: Jason.,00:24:43.550,00:24:44.000
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Jason.,00:24:44.000,00:24:44.420
"So Jason is now the smallest
element I've selected.",00:24:44.420,00:24:47.050
Where is he going to go?,00:24:47.050,00:24:49.160
So where six is.,00:24:49.160,00:24:50.380
And your name is again?,00:24:50.380,00:24:51.210
&gt;&gt; GABE: Gabe.,00:24:51.210,00:24:51.710
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Gabe.,00:24:51.710,00:24:52.340
Gabe's in the way.,00:24:52.340,00:24:53.220
What's the easiest thing to do?,00:24:53.220,00:24:54.640
Swap these two guys and continue.,00:24:54.640,00:24:58.390
So now let's see.,00:24:58.390,00:24:59.020
Who's the smallest?,00:24:59.020,00:25:00.170
Four.,00:25:00.170,00:25:01.030
Let me just kind of cheat.,00:25:01.030,00:25:01.990
Five is going to be the smallest.,00:25:01.990,00:25:03.090
"I find next, if, you want to step
forward, what do I have to do with",00:25:03.090,00:25:05.220
"these guys, with Gabe?",00:25:05.220,00:25:06.820
Swap again.,00:25:06.820,00:25:08.450
"So now, still slightly out of order.",00:25:08.450,00:25:10.740
"I found Gabe to be the smallest, so
I pop him out, move you guys over.",00:25:10.740,00:25:14.140
And done.,00:25:14.140,00:25:15.190
&gt;&gt; So answer is the same.,00:25:15.190,00:25:17.200
The end result is the same.,00:25:17.200,00:25:18.600
"Which of these two algorithms
is better?",00:25:18.600,00:25:22.730
"The second one, I heard.",00:25:22.730,00:25:23.500
Why?,00:25:23.500,00:25:24.252
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 3: It's n steps [INAUDIBLE].,00:25:24.252,00:25:25.900
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: It's n steps at most.,00:25:25.900,00:25:27.600
Interesting.,00:25:27.600,00:25:28.490
So is it though?,00:25:28.490,00:25:30.610
"So how did I find the
smallest element?",00:25:30.610,00:25:33.630
"How many steps did I have to take
the find the smallest element?",00:25:33.630,00:25:37.060
"I had a look all the way
at the end, right?",00:25:37.060,00:25:39.220
"Because in that worst case, what
if Neil were over here?",00:25:39.220,00:25:41.530
"So just finding the smallest element
takes me n steps, or n minus 1.",00:25:41.530,00:25:45.700
"But, OK.",00:25:45.700,00:25:46.100
So fix Neil.,00:25:46.100,00:25:46.980
"Remember that, a minute or so ago.",00:25:46.980,00:25:48.740
"&gt;&gt; But how did I find the next
smallest element?",00:25:48.740,00:25:51.680
"It's n minus 1, or n minus 2 really,
from the number of steps.",00:25:51.680,00:25:54.830
So OK.,00:25:54.830,00:25:55.440
So I did n minus 2.,00:25:55.440,00:25:57.390
All right.,00:25:57.390,00:25:57.600
So that feels a little better.,00:25:57.600,00:25:59.130
All right.,00:25:59.130,00:25:59.730
"How many steps the next time
to find number three?",00:25:59.730,00:26:03.270
So n minus 4.,00:26:03.270,00:26:04.420
"So it's decreasing, one fewer
step on each iteration.",00:26:04.420,00:26:07.670
"So this does feel better, right?",00:26:07.670,00:26:08.740
"If last time it was roughly n times n,
this time it's n minus 1, plus n minus",00:26:08.740,00:26:13.450
"2, plus n minus 3, plus n
minus 4, dot, dot, dot.",00:26:13.450,00:26:16.500
"But if you recall from your high school
textbooks, the little cheat",00:26:16.500,00:26:18.750
"sheet at the back that has formulas, if
you add up this series of numbers,",00:26:18.750,00:26:24.380
"what is the total number of steps
going to be that I take here?",00:26:24.380,00:26:31.280
"&gt;&gt; This is one of those, like, n minus
1, times n, divided by 2.",00:26:31.280,00:26:36.580
"So let me see if I can pull
this up for just a moment.",00:26:36.580,00:26:39.040
"And again, I'm kind of rounding some
numbers just to keep our life simple,",00:26:39.040,00:26:42.230
"but as I recall, it's something like if
I do n minus 1 things, then n minus",00:26:42.230,00:26:47.830
"2, then n minus 3, it's roughly
something like this over 2, and if I",00:26:47.830,00:26:53.570
"multiply this out, that's
actually n square.",00:26:53.570,00:26:55.510
"That's not feeling too good.
n minus n over 2.",00:26:55.510,00:26:58.940
&gt;&gt; But here's the thing.,00:26:58.940,00:27:00.350
"In computer science, when the problems
start to get interesting is when n",00:27:00.350,00:27:03.720
gets really large.,00:27:03.720,00:27:04.700
"And when n gets really large, which of
these values is going to dominate all",00:27:04.700,00:27:08.110
of the others?,00:27:08.110,00:27:09.750
"It's kind of the n squared, right?",00:27:09.750,00:27:10.990
"Yes, dividing by 2 is pretty good.",00:27:10.990,00:27:13.340
"But if you're talking about billions
of pieces of data, or trillions of",00:27:13.340,00:27:16.740
"pieces of data, OK, so
you're twice as fast.",00:27:16.740,00:27:18.700
"But who really cares if that big number,
if this factor is what gets",00:27:18.700,00:27:22.440
bigger and bigger.,00:27:22.440,00:27:23.040
"And surely, it makes more of
a difference than this guy.",00:27:23.040,00:27:25.990
"So even though you guys are right, the
second algorithm, we'll call it",00:27:25.990,00:27:29.120
"selection sort, is, in the real world, a
bit faster potentially, because I am",00:27:29.120,00:27:32.970
"taking fewer and fewer
steps each time.",00:27:32.970,00:27:35.360
&gt;&gt; It's not really fundamentally faster.,00:27:35.360,00:27:37.340
"Because if we actually play this out for
large values of n, at the end of",00:27:37.340,00:27:41.430
"the day, for big enough n, it's still
going to feel pretty slow.",00:27:41.430,00:27:44.750
"Well, let me take one
last pass at that.",00:27:44.750,00:27:46.770
"That's what I would call
selection sort.",00:27:46.770,00:27:48.920
"Can you guys reset yourselves
one last time?",00:27:48.920,00:27:51.040
"And in this last case, I'm going
to propose something",00:27:51.040,00:27:53.550
called insertion sort.,00:27:53.550,00:27:54.970
"Insertion sort being, conceptually,
a bit different.",00:27:54.970,00:27:57.470
"&gt;&gt; Rather than going back and forth and
selecting the smallest element, I'm",00:27:57.470,00:28:00.980
"just going to deal with each of these
guys as I encounter them, and insert",00:28:00.980,00:28:05.030
them into their correct place.,00:28:05.030,00:28:06.850
"So I'm just going to start with Grace,
and I see that she's number four.",00:28:06.850,00:28:10.160
Where does number four belong?,00:28:10.160,00:28:11.720
"I haven't started sorting anything,
so Grace gets to stay right there.",00:28:11.720,00:28:14.940
"And now I'm going to claim, if you could
take a step to your right, this",00:28:14.940,00:28:18.355
"my sorted list, this is my
unsorted remaining list.",00:28:18.355,00:28:21.650
"So now I'm going to proceed next,
and what's your name again?",00:28:21.650,00:28:23.260
&gt;&gt; BRANSON: Branson.,00:28:23.260,00:28:23.700
&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Branson.,00:28:23.700,00:28:24.150
So Branson is number two.,00:28:24.150,00:28:25.375
"So I'm going to take you
out for a moment.",00:28:25.375,00:28:27.490
"And now, where do you belong
in this array?",00:28:27.490,00:28:30.940
So to the right of Grace.,00:28:30.940,00:28:32.360
"So again, we're kind of making
Grace do a lot of work here.",00:28:32.360,00:28:35.670
Where do we put you?,00:28:35.670,00:28:37.290
"So we're going to slide you to the
left, and insert Branson there.",00:28:37.290,00:28:40.120
"But now I claim that
you guys are done.",00:28:40.120,00:28:41.680
"But notice, I'm not using extra space.",00:28:41.680,00:28:43.240
"It's still 2 elements
here, 5 over here.",00:28:43.240,00:28:45.130
"Total array size is 7, so I'm
not cheating, all right?",00:28:45.130,00:28:47.910
"&gt;&gt; So now we have, with Gabe here, the
number six, where do you belong?",00:28:47.910,00:28:51.950
You got lucky again.,00:28:51.950,00:28:52.650
So you get to stay right there.,00:28:52.650,00:28:53.820
"Just take a slight step to the right
just to make clear that you're sorted.",00:28:53.820,00:28:57.210
"And now we have Neil again, number
one, where do you go?",00:28:57.210,00:29:00.520
"And now is where we'll begin to see that
this algorithm, though on first",00:29:00.520,00:29:03.540
"glance, feels pretty smart, watch
what's about to happen.",00:29:03.540,00:29:05.950
If you could step forward.,00:29:05.950,00:29:07.370
&gt;&gt; Where do we want to put Neil?,00:29:07.370,00:29:09.260
"So obviously here, so how
do we get Neil there?",00:29:09.260,00:29:11.830
Let's do this step-by-step.,00:29:11.830,00:29:12.970
"Gabe, where do you need to go?",00:29:12.970,00:29:15.620
"Yep, so take one big step,
or two half-steps to make",00:29:15.620,00:29:19.590
one step over there.,00:29:19.590,00:29:20.820
"Grace, where you go?",00:29:20.820,00:29:21.750
Good.,00:29:21.750,00:29:22.510
So another step.,00:29:22.510,00:29:23.500
"And finally, Branson?",00:29:23.500,00:29:24.960
Another step.,00:29:24.960,00:29:25.460
And now we can put Neil into place.,00:29:25.460,00:29:27.190
"&gt;&gt; So now, continue this logic.",00:29:27.190,00:29:28.440
"Even though we are not shifting Neil
over, and over, and over, to put him",00:29:28.440,00:29:32.420
"where he goes, in the worst case, the
next number we might encounter could",00:29:32.420,00:29:36.420
"be the number, say, there was a number
zero, then we're going to shift all of",00:29:36.420,00:29:42.220
these guys.,00:29:42.220,00:29:42.730
"Suppose that there's a number, negative
one, then we have to shift",00:29:42.730,00:29:44.950
all of these guys.,00:29:44.950,00:29:46.080
"So we're really just kind of flipping
the problem around, such that we're",00:29:46.080,00:29:48.500
"transferring the expense from the
selection process so the insertion",00:29:48.500,00:29:52.620
"process, such that you guys just had
to move roughly n minus something",00:29:52.620,00:29:56.930
number of steps.,00:29:56.930,00:29:57.940
"And that number of steps is only going
to increase as I select more numbers,",00:29:57.940,00:30:01.200
"if I have to keep shoving you guys
back, and back, and back.",00:30:01.200,00:30:04.730
"&gt;&gt; So the sad thing now is all of these
algorithms are n squared.",00:30:04.730,00:30:08.320

guys, and visualize these a bit",00:30:08.320,00:30:10.570

"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: No, you may
keep the numbers as well.",00:30:19.190,00:30:21.990
All right.,00:30:21.990,00:30:23.440
Nicely done.,00:30:23.440,00:30:24.100
All right.,00:30:24.100,00:30:25.300
"So let's see if we can't now summarize
more rapidly, and more visually,",00:30:25.300,00:30:30.510
"exactly what just happened
here as follows.",00:30:30.510,00:30:33.410
"I'm going to go ahead
and pull up Firefox.",00:30:36.510,00:30:38.770
"We'll link this demonstration
on the course's website.",00:30:38.770,00:30:41.310
"Java is a bit annoying to get working
in some browsers these days.",00:30:41.310,00:30:43.870
"So if you do play with this at home,
realize you might need to use Firefox",00:30:43.870,00:30:46.760
to get it working.,00:30:46.760,00:30:47.990
"And what I'm going to do with this
demonstration is the following.",00:30:47.990,00:30:50.440
"&gt;&gt; At the bottom, I have a whole bunch of
menu options, including a start and a",00:30:50.440,00:30:54.875
stop button.,00:30:54.875,00:30:55.840
"Also, as an aside, there seems to be a
bug in these programs, whereby you",00:30:55.840,00:30:59.450
"can't actually see the start or stop
button unless you hold Command or Alt",00:30:59.450,00:31:03.720
"plus and zoom in, which curiously
shows you more buttons.",00:31:03.720,00:31:06.560
"So just FYI if you play
with this at home.",00:31:06.560,00:31:09.090
"Now I'm going to click Start in just a
moment, after specifying a delay of,",00:31:09.090,00:31:12.870
"like, 200 milliseconds here, just
so we can see what happens.",00:31:12.870,00:31:16.810
"&gt;&gt; So I claim that this is a visualization
of the first algorithm",00:31:16.810,00:31:20.180
"these guys did, bubble sort, whereby
we swapped people pair-wise.",00:31:20.180,00:31:23.730
"The key insight to this visualization
is that the height of the bars",00:31:23.730,00:31:27.490
represents the size of the number.,00:31:27.490,00:31:30.510
"So the taller the bar, the
bigger the number.",00:31:30.510,00:31:32.210
"Shorter the bar, smaller the number.",00:31:32.210,00:31:33.680
"And if you notice, we're going through
the first iteration of this algorithm,",00:31:33.680,00:31:38.630
"swapping big and small numbers, so that
the small number comes first and",00:31:38.630,00:31:42.620
the big number goes to the right.,00:31:42.620,00:31:44.280
"&gt;&gt; And as soon as we get the end of array
of many more numbers than seven, we're",00:31:44.280,00:31:48.770
going to go back to the beginning.,00:31:48.770,00:31:49.900
And anticipate this.,00:31:49.900,00:31:51.140
"On the far left, that little guy's going
to swap to the side, and this",00:31:51.140,00:31:54.860
process repeats.,00:31:54.860,00:31:56.010
"Now this visualization quickly gets
boring, so let me go ahead and stop",00:31:56.010,00:31:59.450
"it, change the delay something much
faster just to get now, a feel for",00:31:59.450,00:32:04.170
this algorithm.,00:32:04.170,00:32:05.060
"&gt;&gt; So even though I've sped it up, this is
like upgrading my processor, buying",00:32:05.060,00:32:07.840
a new computer.,00:32:07.840,00:32:08.580
"I haven't fundamentally changed my
algorithm, but you can indeed see more",00:32:08.580,00:32:12.980
"clearly than with humans, that the big
numbers are bubbling up to the top,",00:32:12.980,00:32:16.800
"and the small numbers are bubbling
down to the bottom.",00:32:16.800,00:32:20.900
And now this thing here sorted.,00:32:20.900,00:32:22.390
"And as an aside, in the squares, there's
just some bookkeeping there to",00:32:22.390,00:32:25.260
"help you count how many comparisons,
or how many swaps have",00:32:25.260,00:32:28.010
actually been done.,00:32:28.010,00:32:28.950
"&gt;&gt; Well, let's try one of
the others we saw.",00:32:28.950,00:32:30.750
"Let me click on bubble sort here, and
let me choose, and this whole web page",00:32:30.750,00:32:37.116
is a little buggy.,00:32:37.116,00:32:38.936
"Let's accept the risk
and run it again.",00:32:38.936,00:32:41.155
There we go.,00:32:44.560,00:32:45.030
So let's do selection sort.,00:32:45.030,00:32:47.180
"I don't know why the menu
appears over there.",00:32:47.180,00:32:49.140
"Let's zoom in to fix that
bug, change this to 50.",00:32:49.140,00:32:54.070
"Ah, let's actually do
that much faster.",00:32:54.070,00:32:56.020
"Five milliseconds or so, and Start.",00:32:56.020,00:32:59.160
&gt;&gt; So this is selection sort.,00:32:59.160,00:33:00.470
"So again, think about what we
did with the humans up here.",00:33:00.470,00:33:03.070
"We went through the array and selected
the smallest element again,",00:33:03.070,00:33:08.490
"and again, and again.",00:33:08.490,00:33:09.250
Now I claim that was still pretty bad.,00:33:09.250,00:33:11.110
"It was still n squared, give or take,
but it was, in the real world, a bit",00:33:11.110,00:33:15.010
"faster, because I was indeed taking
slightly fewer steps each time.",00:33:15.010,00:33:18.280
But we're only talking what?,00:33:18.280,00:33:19.800
Maybe 40 or so bars here?,00:33:19.800,00:33:21.830
We're not talking 40 million.,00:33:21.830,00:33:23.200
"So it's not totally clear to me that
was indeed a significant gain.",00:33:23.200,00:33:27.430
"&gt;&gt; Let me now go back and change to our
third algorithm, which was select",00:33:27.430,00:33:32.530
insertion sort.,00:33:32.530,00:33:33.180
"And now it's really buggy because the
menu really shouldn't be down there.",00:33:33.180,00:33:36.380
"So now we'll scroll back up here
and start this algorithm.",00:33:36.380,00:33:40.840
"Whoop, start and stop.",00:33:40.840,00:33:43.270
"So this one kind of has a pretty pattern
to it, whereby we're again",00:33:43.270,00:33:47.160
"inserting the humans, or in
this case, the bars into",00:33:47.160,00:33:50.240
their appropriate location.,00:33:50.240,00:33:52.620
"And it's already done before
I turned around.",00:33:52.620,00:33:55.430
"But this one, too, in theory,
is still n squared.",00:33:55.430,00:33:58.940
"&gt;&gt; So let's see if we can't summarize
these as follows.",00:33:58.940,00:34:01.430
"I'm going to go ahead and just to give
us sort of a common way of talking",00:34:01.430,00:34:04.750
"about these things, let me introduce
just a bit of notation here.",00:34:04.750,00:34:08.489
"You're about to see something called big
O , because it is literally a big",00:34:08.489,00:34:12.480
"O. And this is a way that a computer
scientist or a mathematician even uses",00:34:12.480,00:34:16.320
"to describe the running time
of some algorithm.",00:34:16.320,00:34:19.230
How many steps does it actually take?,00:34:19.230,00:34:21.400
"&gt;&gt; Now I'm going to embarrass myself with
my handwriting here in just a moment.",00:34:21.400,00:34:25.080
"But let me go ahead and say that
this will be big O over here.",00:34:25.080,00:34:29.020
"And let me introduce one other
symbol, a capital omega.",00:34:29.020,00:34:33.610
"Omega is going to be the opposite,
essentially, of big O. Whereas big O",00:34:33.610,00:34:37.080
"means, in the worst case, how much time
might some algorithm take, in",00:34:37.080,00:34:40.790
"terms of n, omega is going to
be how much time might it",00:34:40.790,00:34:43.480
take in the best case.,00:34:43.480,00:34:45.409
"And we'll see what we mean by
best case in just a moment.",00:34:45.409,00:34:48.090
&gt;&gt; So let's start something simple.,00:34:48.090,00:34:49.940
Let me start with a linear search.,00:34:49.940,00:34:54.719
So not sorting.,00:34:54.719,00:34:55.679
We'll call this linear search.,00:34:55.679,00:34:58.000
"And now, make a little
table out of this.",00:34:58.000,00:35:01.140
"And now, in the case of linear search,
in the worst case, how many steps is",00:35:01.140,00:35:06.600
"it going to take me to find a
number of arbitrary choice?",00:35:06.600,00:35:11.770
"And there's n total doors
or n total numbers.",00:35:11.770,00:35:14.540
Worst case.,00:35:14.540,00:35:15.940
"How many steps am I going to have to
take to find the number 50 in an array",00:35:15.940,00:35:18.800
of n doors?,00:35:18.800,00:35:20.830
And why?,00:35:20.830,00:35:21.410
"Because it might be all the
way over onto the end.",00:35:21.410,00:35:23.680
"So much like Jennifer encountered, the
number 50 was all the way over, so in",00:35:23.680,00:35:27.120
"the worst case linear search
is big O of n, we'll say.",00:35:27.120,00:35:30.760
"&gt;&gt; What about the best case,
if you get really lucky?",00:35:30.760,00:35:33.430
"It's just going to take one step,
or a constant number of steps.",00:35:33.430,00:35:36.200
So we'll describe that as 1.,00:35:36.200,00:35:37.830
So this is pretty good.,00:35:37.830,00:35:39.010
"Now what if we did something
like binary search?",00:35:39.010,00:35:41.210
"So binary search, in the worst
case, took how much time?",00:35:43.860,00:35:47.846
&gt;&gt; [INTERPOSING VOICES],00:35:47.846,00:35:49.250
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: So actually, I
heard it in a couple places.",00:35:49.250,00:35:51.310
"So it's actually log n, give or take,
because as we divide the list in half",00:35:51.310,00:35:56.390
"again, and again, and again, we're able
to find, ultimately, the value,",00:35:56.390,00:36:00.730
"if it's there, but there is a catch.",00:36:00.730,00:36:04.750
"What's the assumption that we have to
take for granted for binary search?",00:36:04.750,00:36:08.590
It has to be sorted.,00:36:08.590,00:36:09.700
"It's not sorted, you can split the thing
in half again and again, and you",00:36:09.700,00:36:12.770
"can go left, and you can go right, and
you can go left and right, but you're",00:36:12.770,00:36:15.490
"not going to find the element if
the list isn't sorted, because",00:36:15.490,00:36:18.070
you might miss it.,00:36:18.070,00:36:18.790
"Because your heuristic, for going left
or right is going to be flawed if it's",00:36:18.790,00:36:22.120
indeed not sorted.,00:36:22.120,00:36:23.420
"So there's sort of a hidden cost
to using something like this.",00:36:23.420,00:36:26.110
"&gt;&gt; Now, let's go into our sorting
algorithms not searching--",00:36:26.110,00:36:29.250
"oh, actually let's go in this blank.",00:36:29.250,00:36:31.140
Binary search in the best case?,00:36:31.140,00:36:33.190
"It's also 1 if it just happens to be
in the very middle of the array, or",00:36:33.190,00:36:36.290
the middle of the phone book.,00:36:36.290,00:36:37.810
Now let's do bubble sort.,00:36:37.810,00:36:39.710
"So again, now we're entering the
sorts, not the searches.",00:36:39.710,00:36:42.570
"&gt;&gt; In the worst case, how many steps did we
claim bubble sort's going to take?",00:36:42.570,00:36:47.220
n squared.,00:36:47.220,00:36:48.410
So I'm going to draw that.,00:36:48.410,00:36:49.200
"Ooh, my handwriting looks even worse
when it's projected that big.",00:36:49.200,00:36:51.710
All right.,00:36:51.710,00:36:52.510
So that's n squared.,00:36:52.510,00:36:53.570
"And in the best case of bubble sort,
how many steps is it going to take?",00:36:53.570,00:36:59.460
"1, I heard.",00:36:59.460,00:37:00.980
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: n.,00:37:00.980,00:37:01.760
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: n, I heard.",00:37:01.760,00:37:03.286

"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: 2, I heard.",00:37:04.200,00:37:05.010
Do I hear 3?,00:37:05.010,00:37:06.670
All right.,00:37:06.670,00:37:07.080
"So I've heard 1, n, 2, but let's pick
apart at least the first of those",00:37:07.080,00:37:11.390
"suggestions, 1.",00:37:11.390,00:37:12.330
"It's not a bad instinct, because it
kind of follows a pattern here.",00:37:12.330,00:37:15.370
"But if it only takes 1 step, how in the
world could I claim that the list",00:37:15.370,00:37:19.670
"is sorted, because if I'm only allowed
to take 1 step, how many elements",00:37:19.670,00:37:22.900
could I actually check to be sure?,00:37:22.900,00:37:25.230
"Well, just 1, which means there's n
minus 1 elements that could be out of",00:37:25.230,00:37:28.270
"order, and I'm just going on faith after
looking at 1 element that the",00:37:28.270,00:37:31.310
thing is sorted.,00:37:31.310,00:37:31.850
So 1's not correct here.,00:37:31.850,00:37:33.930
"So minimally, how many
do I have to look at?",00:37:33.930,00:37:35.710
&gt;&gt; [INTERPOSING VOICES],00:37:35.710,00:37:36.680
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: n minus 1, or really,
n, because I need to look at every",00:37:36.680,00:37:40.160
"element to make sure that
it's not out of order.",00:37:40.160,00:37:42.190
"But again, we'll sort of wave our
hands at the smaller numbers and",00:37:42.190,00:37:44.750
"assume that, as n gets large, they're
uninteresting anyway.",00:37:44.750,00:37:47.100
So that's bubble sort.,00:37:47.100,00:37:48.380
"And now, let's do these last two.",00:37:48.380,00:37:49.830
"Selection sort, and then we'll
do insertion sort.",00:37:49.830,00:37:53.520
"And then we will blow your
minds with something much",00:37:53.520,00:37:57.160

time of selection sort?",00:38:00.410,00:38:04.700

"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: n square, I'm hearing.",00:38:05.680,00:38:06.710
"But why n squared, intuitively?",00:38:06.710,00:38:09.790

&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: Because we just did it.,00:38:11.170,00:38:12.260
OK.,00:38:12.260,00:38:12.550
Good answer.,00:38:12.550,00:38:13.380
"But intuitively, why is selection
sort n squared?",00:38:13.380,00:38:16.660
"What did we have to do
again and again?",00:38:16.660,00:38:18.980
"We had to keep scanning through, are
you the smallest, are you the",00:38:18.980,00:38:22.570
"smallest, are you the smallest.",00:38:22.570,00:38:24.020
"And granted, we were able to take n
steps, then n minus 1, then n minus 2.",00:38:24.020,00:38:27.480
"But if you kind of add those all up,
or take it on faith that I've added",00:38:27.480,00:38:30.700
"them up in advance, we get roughly n
squared minus some smaller numbers.",00:38:30.700,00:38:34.810
So I'm going to call this n squared.,00:38:34.810,00:38:36.730
"But with selection sort in the best
case, how many steps is it",00:38:36.730,00:38:39.530
going to take me?,00:38:39.530,00:38:40.632
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 5: [INAUDIBLE],00:38:40.632,00:38:41.840
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J. MALAN: It's unfortunately
still n squared, right?",00:38:41.840,00:38:44.350
"Because if I'm selecting the smallest
element, and we had seven people here,",00:38:44.350,00:38:49.590
"I only know, once I get to the very
end, that I've found the smallest",00:38:49.590,00:38:53.280
"number, wherever he or
she may have been.",00:38:53.280,00:38:55.670
"But how do I find the next
smallest number?",00:38:55.670,00:38:58.820
I have to do another pass.,00:38:58.820,00:39:00.160
"So in the best case, what is the
input to selection sort?",00:39:00.160,00:39:04.810
"It's an already sort list, number one,
number two, number three, number four.",00:39:04.810,00:39:07.830
But I'm a computer.,00:39:07.830,00:39:08.600
"I can only look at one
thing at a time.",00:39:08.600,00:39:10.190
"I can't sort of take a step
back like a human and say,",00:39:10.190,00:39:12.465
"ooh, this looks correct.",00:39:12.465,00:39:14.030
"&gt;&gt; I can only adjudicate correctness in
selection sort by selecting the",00:39:14.030,00:39:17.580
smallest number.,00:39:17.580,00:39:18.370
"But even if I find number one first,
if I don't know anything else about",00:39:18.370,00:39:21.390
"the other numbers, which I don't, all I
know that I've been handed an array",00:39:21.390,00:39:24.460
"or a set of doors behind which are
numbers, the only way I know that one",00:39:24.460,00:39:27.930
was the smallest?,00:39:27.930,00:39:28.680
"If I get all the way here and realize,
damn, one was indeed the smallest.",00:39:28.680,00:39:32.440
"&gt;&gt; But how do I then determine that
two is the next smallest?",00:39:32.440,00:39:34.870
"By doing the same inefficiency
again and again.",00:39:34.870,00:39:38.350
"So finally, with insertion sort,
how, in the worst case,",00:39:38.350,00:39:42.210
did we say it performs?,00:39:42.210,00:39:44.990
It too is n squared.,00:39:44.990,00:39:49.100
And how about with the best case?,00:39:49.100,00:39:53.020
We'll leave that as a cliffhanger.,00:39:53.020,00:39:56.282
"We'll fill in that blank next time,
but first let me propose that we",00:39:56.282,00:40:00.090
"fundamentally do better than
all of these, all right?",00:40:00.090,00:40:02.620
"&gt;&gt; So think for yourself what insertion
sort's going to be.",00:40:02.620,00:40:05.220
"Well, that wasn't very dramatic,
because I'm the only one",00:40:05.220,00:40:06.910
that saw the change.,00:40:06.910,00:40:08.970
Wow.,00:40:08.970,00:40:09.620
OK.,00:40:09.620,00:40:10.420
"So here we have a somewhat
different demonstration.",00:40:10.420,00:40:12.615
"If I zoom in here, you'll see that on
the left we have bubble sort, in the",00:40:12.615,00:40:16.580
"middle we have selection sort, and on
the far right, we have something we",00:40:16.580,00:40:20.740
"haven't looked at yet
called merge sort.",00:40:20.740,00:40:23.380
"But consider what we've been
doing here thus far today.",00:40:23.380,00:40:26.080
"When Jennifer first came up on stage,
we went through the array of numbers",00:40:26.080,00:40:29.200
"again, and again, with linear search,
and we got linear running time, big O",00:40:29.200,00:40:33.750
"of n, so to speak.",00:40:33.750,00:40:35.100
"&gt;&gt; When we now consider the first week of
class, when we had divide and conquer,",00:40:35.100,00:40:41.000
"and we had the phone book tearing,
and Jennifer, and we collectively",00:40:41.000,00:40:43.740
"leveraged that key insight, which was to
repeat yourself again and again by",00:40:43.740,00:40:47.500
"somehow throwing away, throwing away,
throwing away, half of the problem, or",00:40:47.500,00:40:50.930
"generally, dividing a problem in half,
and then treating the smaller piece of",00:40:50.930,00:40:55.320
"the problem as conceptually equivalent
to the other, we somehow did",00:40:55.320,00:40:59.630
fundamentally better.,00:40:59.630,00:41:00.910
"But with bubble sort, with selection
sort, with insertion sort, we've may",00:41:00.910,00:41:04.720
no such insights that Jennifer did.,00:41:04.720,00:41:06.560
"We pretty much just walked back and
forth a whole bunch of times, and we",00:41:06.560,00:41:10.220
"tweaked things a little bit, swapping
in this order, maybe",00:41:10.220,00:41:12.650
inserting or selecting.,00:41:12.650,00:41:13.730
"But at the end of the day, I did a lot
of awkward walking back and forth.",00:41:13.730,00:41:16.950
"We didn't really leverage something
smart like Jennifer did like dividing",00:41:16.950,00:41:21.160
and conquering.,00:41:21.160,00:41:22.040
"&gt;&gt; So merge sort, by contrast, which we
won't see until next week, it's going",00:41:22.040,00:41:25.620
"to leverage that key idea by dividing
the input, and then halving, and then",00:41:25.620,00:41:29.540
"halving, and then halving.",00:41:29.540,00:41:30.580
"And on each iteration of that loop,
sorting the left half, and the right",00:41:30.580,00:41:34.590
"half, then the left half of left half,
and the right half of the left, then",00:41:34.590,00:41:38.200
"the left half of the right half, and
the right half of the right half.",00:41:38.200,00:41:40.990
And repeating again and again.,00:41:40.990,00:41:42.840
"&gt;&gt; So you'll see this visually, but this
is what awaits us next week.",00:41:42.840,00:41:46.170
"And in general, when we think a little
bit harder on any such problem.",00:41:46.170,00:41:49.760
"We have n squared on the left, n
squared in the middle, and n",00:41:52.435,00:41:57.970
log n on the right.,00:41:57.970,00:41:59.400
So there's your real cliffhanger.,00:41:59.400,00:42:00.590
We'll see you on Monday.,00:42:00.590,00:42:02.040
