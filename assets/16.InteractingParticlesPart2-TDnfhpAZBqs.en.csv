"PROFESSOR: OK, let's start.",00:00:20.650,00:00:21.830
"So last time, having
dealt with the ideal gas",00:00:24.530,00:00:29.980
"as much as possible, we started
with interacting systems.",00:00:29.980,00:00:33.225
Let's say interacting gas.,00:00:39.420,00:00:42.660
"And the first topic
that we did was",00:00:42.660,00:00:46.760
"what I called an approach
towards interaction",00:00:46.760,00:00:51.860
through the Cumulant expansion.,00:00:51.860,00:00:54.451
"The idea is that we certainly
solved the problem where",00:00:57.400,00:01:03.720
"we had particles in a box and
it was just a trivial system.",00:01:03.720,00:01:14.550
"Basically, the particles were
independent of each other",00:01:14.550,00:01:20.690
in the canonical ensemble.,00:01:20.690,00:01:23.520
"And things become interesting
if you put interactions",00:01:23.520,00:01:27.540
among all of the particles.,00:01:27.540,00:01:30.710
"Very soon, we will
have a specific form",00:01:30.710,00:01:33.480
of this interaction.,00:01:33.480,00:01:35.520
"But for the beginning,
let's maintain",00:01:35.520,00:01:37.270
it as general as possible.,00:01:37.270,00:01:40.190
"And the idea was
that we are trying",00:01:40.190,00:01:42.240
"to calculate the partition
function for a system that",00:01:42.240,00:01:46.120
has a given temperature.,00:01:46.120,00:01:49.400
"The box has some volume V and
there are N particles in it.",00:01:49.400,00:01:54.410
"And to do so, we have
to integrate over",00:01:54.410,00:01:58.250
"the entirety of the phase
space of N particles.",00:01:58.250,00:02:02.140
"So we have to integrate over all
of the momenta and coordinates",00:02:02.140,00:02:09.100
of e to the minus beta h.,00:02:09.100,00:02:11.710
"But we said that we are
going to first of all,",00:02:11.710,00:02:15.580
"note that for
identical particles,",00:02:15.580,00:02:18.330
"we can't tell apart
the phase space",00:02:18.330,00:02:21.720
"if you were to make these in
[? factorial ?] permutations.",00:02:21.720,00:02:25.340
"And we also made
it dimensionless",00:02:25.340,00:02:27.650
by dividing by h to the 3n.,00:02:27.650,00:02:30.620
"And then we have e
to the minus beta",00:02:30.620,00:02:33.250
"h, which has a part that is
e to the minus sum over i pi",00:02:33.250,00:02:39.340
"squared over 2m, that
depends on the momenta.",00:02:39.340,00:02:43.240
"And a part that depends
on the interaction U.",00:02:43.240,00:02:48.660
"The integrals over the
momenta, we can easily perform.",00:02:48.660,00:02:52.390
"They give us the
result of Gaussians",00:02:52.390,00:02:55.770
"that we can express as
lambda to the power of 3n",00:02:55.770,00:03:03.240
"where we introduced this lambda
to be h over root 2 pi m k t.",00:03:03.240,00:03:09.322
"And actually, sort
of keeping in mind",00:03:12.770,00:03:18.170
"the result that we had for
the case of the ideal gas,",00:03:18.170,00:03:22.620
"let's rewrite this as V over
lambda cubed to the power of N.",00:03:22.620,00:03:28.700
"So I essentially divided
and multiplied by V to the N",00:03:28.700,00:03:34.770
"so that this part
becomes the partition",00:03:34.770,00:03:37.200
"function than I would
have had if U was absent.",00:03:37.200,00:03:42.010
"And so then the remainder is the
integral over all of the q's,",00:03:42.010,00:03:47.650
"but I divided by
V. So basically,",00:03:47.650,00:03:50.580
"with each integration,
I'm uniformly",00:03:50.580,00:03:53.580
"sampling all of the points
inside the box with probability",00:03:53.580,00:03:57.890
"density 1/V e to
the minus beta U.",00:03:57.890,00:04:02.540
"And we said that
this quantity we",00:04:02.540,00:04:05.760
"can regard as sampling
e to the minus beta U",00:04:05.760,00:04:10.470
"through 0 to all
other probability",00:04:10.470,00:04:12.540
"distribution in which the
particles ideal-like are",00:04:12.540,00:04:17.149
uniformly distributed.,00:04:17.149,00:04:19.160
"And we call this e
to the minus beta U.",00:04:19.160,00:04:23.870
"And the index 0
again to indicate",00:04:23.870,00:04:27.810
"that we are dealing
with a uniform 0",00:04:27.810,00:04:31.265
"to order distribution
with respect",00:04:31.265,00:04:33.750
to which this average is taken.,00:04:33.750,00:04:35.584
"And then, this quantity
we can write as Z0.",00:04:38.190,00:04:44.060
"And this exponential
we can formally",00:04:44.060,00:04:46.760
"express as a sum
over all, let's say,",00:04:46.760,00:04:51.160
"l running from 0 to
infinity minus beta",00:04:51.160,00:04:54.750
to the l divided by l factorial.,00:04:54.750,00:04:58.080
"Then, expanding this, a quantity
that depends on the coordinates",00:04:58.080,00:05:02.290
"is U. So I could have U raised
to the l power, this kind",00:05:02.290,00:05:06.930
"of average taken
with respect to that.",00:05:06.930,00:05:10.360
"And immediately, my
writing something like this",00:05:10.360,00:05:13.720
"suggests that what
I'm after eventually",00:05:13.720,00:05:17.110
"is some kind of a
perturbation theory.",00:05:17.110,00:05:20.120
"Because I know how to solve
the problem where U is absent.",00:05:20.120,00:05:24.460
That's the ideal gas problem.,00:05:24.460,00:05:26.370
"Maybe we can start to move
away from the ideal gas",00:05:26.370,00:05:29.900
"and calculate things
perturbatively",00:05:29.900,00:05:33.160
in some quantity.,00:05:33.160,00:05:34.850
"And exactly what
that quantity is",00:05:34.850,00:05:36.910
will become apparent shortly.,00:05:36.910,00:05:39.090
"At this time, it looks like
it's an expansion in beta U",00:05:39.090,00:05:43.260
having to be a small quantity.,00:05:43.260,00:05:46.850
"Now, of course, for calculating
thermodynamic functions",00:05:46.850,00:05:51.050
"and behaviors, we don't
really rely usually on Z,",00:05:51.050,00:05:55.520
"but log Z, which can be
related to the free energy,",00:05:55.520,00:05:59.120
for example.,00:05:59.120,00:06:01.110
"So taking the log
of that expression,",00:06:01.110,00:06:04.230
I have a term that is log of Z0.,00:06:04.230,00:06:07.490
"And a term that is
the log of that sum.",00:06:07.490,00:06:11.190
"But we recognize that
that sum, in some sense,",00:06:11.190,00:06:14.530
"is a generator of moments
of this quantity U.",00:06:14.530,00:06:20.240
"And we have
experienced that when",00:06:20.240,00:06:22.020
"we take the logarithm of a
generator of moments, what",00:06:22.020,00:06:25.565
"we will get is a
generator of Cumulants,",00:06:25.565,00:06:29.350
"now starting with l
equals to 1 minus beta",00:06:29.350,00:06:33.460
"to the power of l
divided by l factorial U",00:06:33.460,00:06:38.180
to the l0 with a subscript c.,00:06:38.180,00:06:42.910
"Of course, this subscript c sort
of captures all of the various",00:06:42.910,00:06:48.880
"subtractions that you
have to make in order",00:06:48.880,00:06:51.600
"to go from a moment
to a Cumulant.",00:06:51.600,00:06:54.120
"But that's quite
general and something",00:06:54.120,00:06:56.070
"that we know essentially is
relating log of the expansion",00:06:56.070,00:07:00.720
to the expansion itself.,00:07:00.720,00:07:02.120
But that's well-known.,00:07:02.120,00:07:03.170
"So presumably, I can
perturbatively calculate these.",00:07:05.790,00:07:10.230
"And I will have,
therefore, progressively",00:07:10.230,00:07:13.410
"better approximations
to log Z in the presence",00:07:13.410,00:07:17.130
of this interaction.,00:07:17.130,00:07:19.810
"Now at this point,
we have to start",00:07:19.810,00:07:22.270
"thinking about a particular
expression for U.",00:07:22.270,00:07:29.150
"So let's imagine that our U is a
sum over pairwise interactions.",00:07:29.150,00:07:34.850
"So if I think about
the particles,",00:07:34.850,00:07:37.290
"there are molecules that
are in the gas in this room.",00:07:37.290,00:07:41.030
"Basically, the most important
thing is when the two of them",00:07:41.030,00:07:43.880
"approach each other and I have
to put a pairwise interaction",00:07:43.880,00:07:47.960
between them of this form.,00:07:47.960,00:07:50.710
"In principle, I could add
three-point and higher-order",00:07:50.710,00:07:53.280
interactions.,00:07:53.280,00:07:54.530
"But for all intents
and purposes,",00:07:54.530,00:07:57.290
this should be enough.,00:07:57.290,00:07:59.140
"And then again, what I
have here to evaluate,",00:07:59.140,00:08:04.190
"the first term
would be minus beta,",00:08:04.190,00:08:07.735
"the average of the first
power, and the next one",00:08:07.735,00:08:14.730
will be beta squared over 2.,00:08:14.730,00:08:17.810
"For the first Cumulant,
it is the same thing",00:08:17.810,00:08:20.090
as the first moment.,00:08:20.090,00:08:21.870
"The second Cumulant is the
thing that is the variance.",00:08:21.870,00:08:24.550
"So this would have been
U squared 0 minus average",00:08:24.550,00:08:28.520
"of U squared, and then
there will be higher orders.",00:08:28.520,00:08:32.633
"So let's calculate these
first two moments explicitly",00:08:38.760,00:08:43.669
for this potential.,00:08:43.669,00:08:46.250
"So the first term U in this 0
to order average, what is it?",00:08:46.250,00:08:54.110
"Well, that's my U. So I
have to do a sum over i",00:08:54.110,00:08:59.270
and j of V of qi minus qj.,00:08:59.270,00:09:06.570
What does the averaging mean?,00:09:06.570,00:09:08.380
"It means I have to integrate
this over all qi divided",00:09:08.380,00:09:14.670
"by V. Let's call this qk divided
V and this is [INAUDIBLE].",00:09:14.670,00:09:19.030
"OK, so let's say we look at the
first term in this series which",00:09:22.958,00:09:28.400
involves V of q1 minus q2.,00:09:28.400,00:09:33.390
"Let's say we pick
that pair, q1 and q2.",00:09:33.390,00:09:36.800
"And explicitly, what I have
here is integrals over q1, q2,",00:09:36.800,00:09:45.940
"qn, each one of them
coming with a factor of V.",00:09:45.940,00:09:54.520
"Now, of course, it doesn't
matter which pair I pick.",00:09:54.520,00:09:58.100
Everything is symmetric.,00:09:58.100,00:09:59.580
"The weight that I start
with uniformly is symmetric.",00:09:59.580,00:10:03.090
"So clearly, my
choice of this pair",00:10:03.090,00:10:06.510
"was arbitrary and
the answer when",00:10:06.510,00:10:08.500
"I do the sum is the answer for
1 times the number of pairs,",00:10:08.500,00:10:12.950
which is N N minus 1 over 2.,00:10:12.950,00:10:14.680
"Now, over here I have
integrals over q3 or qn,",00:10:19.250,00:10:23.510
"et cetera, that don't
appear in the function",00:10:23.510,00:10:26.260
that I'm integrating.,00:10:26.260,00:10:27.840
"So all of those integrals
will give me factors of 1.",00:10:27.840,00:10:32.100
"And really, the only thing
that I am going to be left with",00:10:32.100,00:10:34.660
"is these two integrals
over q1 and q2.",00:10:34.660,00:10:39.020
"But even then, the function
that I'm integrating",00:10:39.020,00:10:42.310
"is only a function of
the relative coordinate",00:10:42.310,00:10:45.230
that I can call q.,00:10:45.230,00:10:47.270
"And then I can, if I want,
integrate over q1 and q.",00:10:47.270,00:10:54.470
"The integral over q1
would also give me",00:10:54.470,00:10:56.970
1 when I divide by the volume.,00:10:56.970,00:10:59.520
"So the answer is going
to be N N minus 1 over 2,",00:10:59.520,00:11:04.280
which is the number of pairs.,00:11:04.280,00:11:06.600
"The integral over the
relative coordinate times",00:11:06.600,00:11:11.420
"the potential-- there
is a factor of 1 over V",00:11:11.420,00:11:14.330
that I can put out here.,00:11:14.330,00:11:17.780
"So you tell me what the
first pair potential is",00:11:17.780,00:11:21.790
"and I tell you that this is the
first correction that you will",00:11:21.790,00:11:25.790
"get once you multiply
by minus beta",00:11:25.790,00:11:29.780
"to log Z from which you
can calculate the partition",00:11:29.780,00:11:32.890
functions.,00:11:32.890,00:11:35.450
Yes.,00:11:35.450,00:11:36.642
"AUDIENCE: How did you turn the
product of two differentials",00:11:36.642,00:11:39.222
"d q1 times d q2 into
just one differential?",00:11:39.222,00:11:44.670
"PROFESSOR: OK, I have
the integral dq q1 dq q2,",00:11:44.670,00:11:49.590
some function of q1 minus q2.,00:11:49.590,00:11:53.000
"I change variables keeping
q1 as one of my variables",00:11:53.000,00:11:58.160
"and q [INAUDIBLE] replace
q2 with q minus q2.",00:11:58.160,00:12:03.800
"So then I have the
integration over q1.",00:12:03.800,00:12:06.950
I have the integration over q2.,00:12:06.950,00:12:10.200
"Not q2, but q f of q.",00:12:10.200,00:12:14.160
And then everything's fine.,00:12:14.160,00:12:15.520
"All right, so that's
the first term.",00:12:23.280,00:12:25.950
Let's calculate the next term.,00:12:25.950,00:12:29.140
"Next term becomes
somewhat interesting.",00:12:29.140,00:12:33.540
"I have to calculate this
quantity as a Cumulant.",00:12:33.540,00:12:39.520
It's the variance.,00:12:39.520,00:12:41.785
V itself is a sum over pairs.,00:12:45.900,00:12:49.480
"So to get V squared
to U squared,",00:12:49.480,00:12:53.200
"I have to essentially
square this expression.",00:12:53.200,00:12:56.160
"So rather than having
sum over one pair ij,",00:12:56.160,00:12:59.780
"I have the sum over
two pairs ij and kl.",00:12:59.780,00:13:02.690
"And then what I
need to calculate",00:13:05.890,00:13:09.120
"is an average that if
I were to square this,",00:13:09.120,00:13:12.910
"I will get v of qi minus
qj, v of qk minus ql 0.",00:13:12.910,00:13:22.230
"This will be the
average of U squared.",00:13:22.230,00:13:25.720
"But when I calculate
the variance,",00:13:25.720,00:13:28.900
"I have to subtract from it
the average of U squared.",00:13:28.900,00:13:32.380
"So I have to subtract V of
qi minus qj V of qk minus ql.",00:13:32.380,00:13:40.502
Fine.,00:13:49.810,00:13:52.510
"So this is just rewriting
of that expression",00:13:52.510,00:13:57.190
in terms of the sum.,00:13:57.190,00:14:00.000
"Now, each one of these is
N N minus 1 over two terms.",00:14:00.000,00:14:06.590
"And so this, when I sum
over all possibility,",00:14:06.590,00:14:10.016
"is the square of N N minus 1
over two possible terms that",00:14:10.016,00:14:15.640
"will occur here in the
series that I've written.",00:14:15.640,00:14:20.220
"Now, let's group those terms
that can occur in this as",00:14:20.220,00:14:26.190
follows.,00:14:26.190,00:14:27.620
"One class of terms
will be when the pair",00:14:27.620,00:14:33.680
"ij that I pick for the first sum
is distinct from the pair kl.",00:14:33.680,00:14:45.260
"So huge number of terms
as I go through the pairs",00:14:45.260,00:14:49.140
will have this possibility.,00:14:49.140,00:14:52.720
"OK, then what happens?",00:14:52.720,00:14:55.400
"Then when I calculate the
average of qi minus qj qk minus",00:14:55.400,00:15:02.640
"ql, which is this part, what
I need to do is to do all",00:15:02.640,00:15:09.580
"of these integral of
this form over all q's.",00:15:09.580,00:15:19.420
"And then I have this V of qi
minus qj V of qk minus ql.",00:15:19.420,00:15:26.630
"Now, my statement is that
I have, let's say here,",00:15:29.745,00:15:32.980
"q1 and q2 and somewhere
else q7 and q8.",00:15:32.980,00:15:37.450
"Or, q7 and q974.",00:15:37.450,00:15:39.740
It doesn't matter.,00:15:39.740,00:15:41.710
"The point is that
this integral that",00:15:41.710,00:15:43.880
"involves this pair
of variables has",00:15:43.880,00:15:45.810
"nothing to do with
the integral that",00:15:45.810,00:15:47.310
"involves the other
pair of variables.",00:15:47.310,00:15:49.650
"So this answer is the same
thing as the average of qi",00:15:49.650,00:15:54.460
minus qj average of qk minus ql.,00:15:54.460,00:16:00.120
"Essentially, in the 0 order
probability that we are using,",00:16:00.120,00:16:04.000
"the particles are
completely independently",00:16:04.000,00:16:06.620
"exploring this space and these
averages will independently",00:16:06.620,00:16:11.040
"rely on one pair
and independently",00:16:11.040,00:16:13.160
rely on another pair.,00:16:13.160,00:16:15.380
"And once this kind of
factorization occurs,",00:16:15.380,00:16:21.060
"it's clear that this
subtraction that I",00:16:21.060,00:16:24.640
"need to do for the variance
will get rid of this term.",00:16:24.640,00:16:28.430
"So these pairs do
not contribute.",00:16:28.430,00:16:33.090
No contribution.,00:16:33.090,00:16:33.765
"If you like, this is this thing.",00:16:38.450,00:16:41.510
"All right, so let's do the
next possible term, ij and ik,",00:16:45.320,00:16:53.678
with k not equal to this k.,00:16:53.678,00:16:57.710
"So basically, I make the pairs
have one point in common.",00:16:57.710,00:17:02.720
"So previously, I had a
pair here, a pair here.",00:17:02.720,00:17:05.460
"Now I joined one
of their points.",00:17:05.460,00:17:08.390
So what do I get here?,00:17:08.390,00:17:11.760
"I will get for this average
qi minus qj qi minus ql.",00:17:11.760,00:17:20.520
"You can see that essentially,
the three integrals that I need",00:17:20.520,00:17:24.470
"to worry about are
the integrals that",00:17:24.470,00:17:27.060
involve these three indices.,00:17:27.060,00:17:28.510
All the others will give me 0.,00:17:28.510,00:17:30.810
"So this is going to be the
integral qi qj ql divided by V.",00:17:30.810,00:17:40.370
"I have V of qi minus
qj V of qi minus ql.",00:17:40.370,00:17:47.170
"AUDIENCE: You
switched [INAUDIBLE].",00:17:50.026,00:17:52.237
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:17:52.237,00:17:52.820
I think that's fine.,00:17:58.720,00:18:00.050
All right.,00:18:04.440,00:18:06.640
"Now, I can do the same
thing that I did over here.",00:18:06.640,00:18:11.150
I have three variables.,00:18:11.150,00:18:13.760
"I will pick qi to stay
as one of my variables.",00:18:13.760,00:18:17.370
"I replace qj with this
difference, q j i.",00:18:17.370,00:18:23.920
"I replace ql with
its distance to i.",00:18:23.920,00:18:29.440
"And again, I can
independently integrate",00:18:32.120,00:18:34.610
over these three variables.,00:18:34.610,00:18:37.810
"So this again,
becomes the same thing",00:18:37.810,00:18:41.520
"as V of qi minus qj average
V of qi minus ql average.",00:18:41.520,00:18:50.670
"And again, there
is no contribution.",00:18:50.670,00:18:52.430
"Now, the first class it was
obvious because this pair",00:19:02.430,00:19:06.180
"and this pair were
completely distinct.",00:19:06.180,00:19:09.800
"This class is a
little bit more subtle",00:19:09.800,00:19:12.830
"because I joined one
of the points together,",00:19:12.830,00:19:17.300
"and then I used this and
this as well as this point",00:19:17.300,00:19:23.090
as independent variables.,00:19:23.090,00:19:25.280
"And I saw that the sum
breaks into pieces.",00:19:25.280,00:19:29.450
"And you won't be
surprised if no matter",00:19:29.450,00:19:32.680
"how complicated I make various
more interactions over here,",00:19:32.680,00:19:37.870
"I can measure all of the
coordinates with respect",00:19:37.870,00:19:40.780
"to the single point and
same thing would happen.",00:19:40.780,00:19:44.150
"This class of diagrams are
called 1-particle reducible.",00:19:44.150,00:19:52.548
"And the first part had to
do with distinct graphs.",00:19:52.548,00:19:56.160
"You didn't have to
worry about them.",00:19:56.160,00:19:58.090
"But if I were to sort of
convert this expression--",00:19:58.090,00:20:01.170
"and we will do so
shortly-- into graphs,",00:20:01.170,00:20:04.150
"it corresponds to
graphs where there",00:20:04.150,00:20:06.575
"is a point from which
everything else is hanging.",00:20:06.575,00:20:10.620
"And measuring
coordinates with respect",00:20:10.620,00:20:12.760
"to that point will allow the
average to break into pieces,",00:20:12.760,00:20:18.490
"and then to be removed
through this subtraction.",00:20:18.490,00:20:23.520
"So this is simple example of
something that is more general.",00:20:23.520,00:20:28.190
"So at the level of this
second-order theorem,",00:20:28.190,00:20:31.560
"the only type of thing
that will survive",00:20:31.560,00:20:34.540
"is if the pairs are
identical, ij and other term",00:20:34.540,00:20:40.030
is also the same pair ij.,00:20:40.030,00:20:41.780
What do I get then?,00:20:44.380,00:20:46.250
"I get V of qi minus
qj squared minus V",00:20:46.250,00:20:58.613
of qi minus qj 0 order squared.,00:20:58.613,00:21:04.740
"So it's the variance of a
single one of these bond",00:21:04.740,00:21:09.260
contributions.,00:21:09.260,00:21:11.060
"If I write that in
terms of integrals,",00:21:11.060,00:21:14.390
"this becomes the
integral d cubed q1,",00:21:14.390,00:21:19.200
"d cubed q2-- well, qi qj.",00:21:19.200,00:21:26.580
"I will have factors
of V. Then, I",00:21:26.580,00:21:30.210
"would have V squared qi
minus qj for the first term",00:21:30.210,00:21:39.250
"and then the square of something
like this for the second term.",00:21:39.250,00:21:51.360
"So putting everything
together up to this order,",00:21:58.680,00:22:04.560
what do I get?,00:22:04.560,00:22:05.580
"I will get log Z,
which is log of Z0.",00:22:05.580,00:22:09.530
"Let me remind you,
log of Z0 was N log",00:22:09.530,00:22:13.560
"of V over lambda cubed N.
That's on form such as this.",00:22:13.560,00:22:24.400
"And then I have
these corrections.",00:22:24.400,00:22:26.865
"Note that both of the
terms that have survived",00:22:29.490,00:22:33.520
"correspond to
looking at one pair.",00:22:33.520,00:22:37.240
"So the corrections will be
of the order of N N minus 1",00:22:37.240,00:22:42.620
over 2.,00:22:42.620,00:22:43.850
"Because in both cases, I
really look at one pair.",00:22:43.850,00:22:48.000
"The first contribution was minus
beta integral d cubed q v of q.",00:22:48.000,00:22:55.230
"There was a factor of
1 over V. Actually,",00:22:55.230,00:22:57.600
"I can take-- well, let's
put the factor of 1 over V",00:22:57.600,00:23:01.270
here for the time being.,00:23:01.270,00:23:03.970
"The next term will be
beta squared over 2",00:23:03.970,00:23:10.290
"because I am looking at
the second-order term.",00:23:10.290,00:23:12.740
And what do I have?,00:23:12.740,00:23:14.701
"I have the difference
of integral d cubed q",00:23:14.701,00:23:19.610
over V V squared.,00:23:19.610,00:23:21.240
"And the square of the integral
of d cubed q over V V.",00:23:25.010,00:23:32.210
"And presumably, there
will be higher-order terms",00:23:32.210,00:23:34.910
as we will discuss.,00:23:34.910,00:23:36.367
"Now, I'm interested in the
limit of thermodynamics",00:23:40.510,00:23:45.760
where N and V are large.,00:23:45.760,00:23:47.800
"And in that limit,
what do I get?",00:23:51.480,00:23:53.250
I will get log Z is log of Z0.,00:23:53.250,00:23:56.800
"And then I can see that these
terms I can write as beta.",00:24:00.520,00:24:10.340
"N N minus 1 I will
replace will N squared.",00:24:10.340,00:24:14.900
"The factors-- here I
have a 1 over V. Here,",00:24:14.900,00:24:18.250
I have 1 over V squared.,00:24:18.250,00:24:20.310
"So this factor is
smaller by an amount that",00:24:20.310,00:24:23.920
"is order of V in
the large V-limit.",00:24:23.920,00:24:28.560
"I will bring the
factor of V outside,",00:24:28.560,00:24:32.770
so I have something like this.,00:24:32.770,00:24:35.310
"And then, what do I have here?",00:24:35.310,00:24:38.090
"Actually, let's keep
this in this form,",00:24:38.090,00:24:43.530
"minus beta integral
d cubed q V plus beta",00:24:43.530,00:24:50.455
"squared over 2 integral d
cubed q V squared [INAUDIBLE].",00:24:50.455,00:24:57.460
"So the kinds of things
that we are interested",00:25:04.590,00:25:06.690
"and we can measure are
the energy of the system,",00:25:06.690,00:25:09.980
"but let's say we
focus on pressure.",00:25:09.980,00:25:11.585
"And if you look through various
things that we derived before,",00:25:15.700,00:25:21.140
"beta times the
pressure you can get",00:25:21.140,00:25:23.510
"from taking a derivative
of log Z with respect to V.",00:25:23.510,00:25:35.220
"We can express the log Z in
terms of the free energy,",00:25:35.220,00:25:39.160
"and then the derivative of free
energy with respect to volume",00:25:39.160,00:25:41.940
"will give you the pressure of
the various factors of beta",00:25:41.940,00:25:44.830
"[? and signs, ?] we
will come up with this.",00:25:44.830,00:25:47.660
"So from the first term, N long
V, we get our ideal gas result.",00:25:47.660,00:25:53.360
"Beta p is the same
thing as density.",00:25:53.360,00:25:57.920
"And we see that we get a
correction from here when",00:25:57.920,00:26:01.830
"I divide by-- when I take
a derivative with respect",00:26:01.830,00:26:05.420
"to V of 1 over V, I will
get minus 1 over V squared.",00:26:05.420,00:26:09.760
"So the next term would be
the square of the density.",00:26:09.760,00:26:13.040
"And then, there is
a series that we",00:26:16.260,00:26:18.310
"will encounter which depends
on the interaction potential.",00:26:18.310,00:26:27.650
"Now, it turns out that
so far I have calculated",00:26:32.960,00:26:37.070
"terms that relied on
only two points, ij.",00:26:37.070,00:26:41.400
"And hence, they
become at the end",00:26:41.400,00:26:43.740
proportional to density squared.,00:26:43.740,00:26:46.750
"If I go further
in my expansion, I",00:26:46.750,00:26:48.930
"will encounter things that I
will need triangular points.",00:26:48.930,00:26:52.770
"For example, i j k
forming a triangle.",00:26:52.770,00:26:56.470
"And then, that would
give me something",00:26:56.470,00:26:58.490
"that would be of the order
of the density cubed.",00:26:58.490,00:27:00.750
"So somehow, I can also see
that ultimately this series",00:27:03.300,00:27:11.030
"in perturbation theory,
as we shall see,",00:27:11.030,00:27:14.080
"also more precisely can be
organized in powers of density.",00:27:14.080,00:27:18.980
Why is that important?,00:27:18.980,00:27:21.210
"Because typically,
as we discussed right",00:27:21.210,00:27:23.930
"at the beginning, when you
look at the pressure of a gas",00:27:23.930,00:27:27.580
"when it is dilute and
over V is very small,",00:27:27.580,00:27:31.050
it is always ideal gas-like.,00:27:31.050,00:27:34.140
"As you make it more
dense, you start",00:27:34.140,00:27:36.620
"to get corrections that you can
express in powers of density.",00:27:36.620,00:27:41.300
"And the coefficients of that
are called Virial coefficients.",00:27:41.300,00:27:45.020
"So in some sense,
we have already",00:27:45.020,00:27:46.810
"started in calculating the
second Virial coefficient,",00:27:46.810,00:27:50.850
"and there are higher-order
Virial coefficients,",00:27:50.850,00:27:53.620
"which together give you the
equation of states relating",00:27:53.620,00:27:56.960
"pressure to density
by a power series.",00:27:56.960,00:28:01.059
AUDIENCE: Question.,00:28:01.059,00:28:01.850
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:28:01.850,00:28:02.632
"AUDIENCE: The
Virial coefficients,",00:28:02.632,00:28:04.048
"if they have integral
over the whole volume,",00:28:04.048,00:28:06.670
"then they will be
functions of volume, right?",00:28:06.670,00:28:09.956
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:28:09.956,00:28:10.580
"But imagine that I'm thinking
about the gas in this room",00:28:10.580,00:28:14.170
"and the interaction of
two oxygen molecules.",00:28:14.170,00:28:16.590
"So what I am saying is you
pick an oxygen molecule.",00:28:16.590,00:28:20.290
"There is interaction and
I have to integrate over",00:28:20.290,00:28:22.940
"where the other
oxygen molecule is.",00:28:22.940,00:28:25.530
"And by the time it
is tiny, tiny bit",00:28:25.530,00:28:28.250
"[? away, ?] the
interaction is 0.",00:28:28.250,00:28:30.800
It doesn't really matter.,00:28:30.800,00:28:33.886
"AUDIENCE: If the characteristic
volume of interaction",00:28:33.886,00:28:36.353
is much smaller than volume--,00:28:36.353,00:28:37.561
PROFESSOR: Of the space.,00:28:37.561,00:28:38.741
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], then
the integrals just converge",00:28:38.741,00:28:41.032
to [? constant. ?],00:28:41.032,00:28:41.660
PROFESSOR: That's right.,00:28:41.660,00:28:42.660
"So if you want to be
even more precise,",00:28:42.660,00:28:45.170
"you will get corrections
when your particles are",00:28:45.170,00:28:48.610
"close to the wall and
uniformity, et cetera,",00:28:48.610,00:28:50.840
is violated.,00:28:50.840,00:28:52.790

OK?,00:33:28.256,00:33:30.570
All right.,00:33:30.570,00:33:31.930

the following-- let's say",00:33:31.930,00:33:36.880

the gas in this room",00:33:36.880,00:33:39.940

"we will clarify
later on-- this term",00:34:07.930,00:34:11.780
"corresponds to taking a
pair of points and a V",00:34:11.780,00:34:14.800
that connects them.,00:34:14.800,00:34:17.449
"And this term
corresponds to two V's",00:34:17.449,00:34:21.080
"going between the
same pair of points.",00:34:21.080,00:34:24.090
"And you say, well,
there will be terms",00:34:24.090,00:34:26.020
"that will involve three
V's, four V's, and they",00:34:26.020,00:34:30.000
"will contribute in the series in
a manner that I can recognize.",00:34:30.000,00:34:35.949
"So why don't I add all
of those terms together?",00:34:35.949,00:34:40.350

the resulting object something",00:34:40.350,00:34:46.699
else.,00:34:46.699,00:34:49.340
What is that something else?,00:34:49.340,00:34:51.219

is I have minus beta V.",00:34:51.219,00:34:55.585
"Well, all of them--
so what is this?",00:34:55.585,00:34:58.430
It is the integral d cubed q.,00:34:58.430,00:35:03.120
"I have minus beta V
plus 1/2 beta V squared.",00:35:03.120,00:35:11.740
"The next term is
going to be minus 1",00:35:11.740,00:35:13.840
"over 3 factorial beta V
cubed because it will come",00:35:13.840,00:35:18.240
"from the third-order
term in the expansion.",00:35:18.240,00:35:21.050
And I can go on.,00:35:21.050,00:35:23.740
"And you say, well,
obviously this whole thing",00:35:23.740,00:35:27.850
"came from the expansion
of e to the minus beta V",00:35:27.850,00:35:31.820
"except that I don't have
the 0 order term, 1.",00:35:31.820,00:35:35.960
"So this quantity that I will
call f of q rather than V of q",00:35:35.960,00:35:44.070
"is obtained as e to the
minus beta V of q minus 1.",00:35:44.070,00:35:49.740
"So if I were to, in fact,
add up an infinite number",00:35:56.220,00:36:00.420
"of terms in the series
rather than having",00:36:00.420,00:36:03.500
"to integrate V V squared
V cubed, each one of them",00:36:03.500,00:36:07.770
is divergence.,00:36:07.770,00:36:09.390
I have to integrate this f of q.,00:36:09.390,00:36:12.600
"So let's see what this f of
q-- or correspondingly, f of r",00:36:12.600,00:36:17.980
looks like as a function of r.,00:36:17.980,00:36:19.670
"So in the range that
I have my hard core",00:36:22.910,00:36:28.970
"and V is large and positive,
this is going to give me 0.",00:36:28.970,00:36:35.650
"So the function is
minus 1 down here.",00:36:35.650,00:36:41.898
"At exactly whatever point it
is that the potential is 0,",00:36:41.898,00:36:49.480
then f is also 0.,00:36:49.480,00:36:51.200
"So basically, I will
come to the same 0.",00:36:51.200,00:36:54.505
"When the potential is negative,
this will be larger than 1.",00:36:57.180,00:37:03.570
My f will be positive.,00:37:03.570,00:37:05.530
"So presumably, it
will have some kind",00:37:05.530,00:37:07.340
"of a peak around
where this peak is.",00:37:07.340,00:37:11.400
"And then at large distances,
it goes back towards 0.",00:37:11.400,00:37:15.690
"So this is going to go back
towards 1 minus 1, which is 0.",00:37:15.690,00:37:21.065
"So actually, this
end of the potential",00:37:21.065,00:37:23.100
is the same thing as minus beta.,00:37:23.100,00:37:25.243
"And whereas I couldn't integrate
any one term in this series,",00:37:30.800,00:37:36.330
"I can certainly integrate
the sum over all positions",00:37:36.330,00:37:40.460
"and it will give
me a number, which",00:37:40.460,00:37:43.320
"will depend on
temperature, the properties",00:37:43.320,00:37:45.500
"of the potential, et cetera.",00:37:45.500,00:37:47.790
"And it is that number
that will tell me",00:37:47.790,00:37:51.080
"what the density squared term in
the expression for the pressure",00:37:51.080,00:37:54.660
"is and what the second
Virial coefficient is.",00:37:54.660,00:37:59.735
Yes.,00:37:59.735,00:38:00.235
"AUDIENCE: Is this basically
an excluded volume of sorts?",00:38:00.235,00:38:03.894
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:38:03.894,00:38:04.560
"So this part if I
sent it to infinity,",00:38:04.560,00:38:06.870
"corresponds to an
excluded volume.",00:38:06.870,00:38:09.040
"So if you want really excluded
volume, this would be minus 1",00:38:09.040,00:38:12.670
up to some point.,00:38:12.670,00:38:14.309
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:38:14.309,00:38:15.225
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:38:15.225,00:38:15.891
"But I'm talking
about very general,",00:38:15.891,00:38:18.800
"so I would say that
excluded volume can",00:38:18.800,00:38:21.730
"be very easily captured
within this [INAUDIBLE].",00:38:21.730,00:38:24.095
All right.,00:38:31.720,00:38:34.400
"So we want to sort of
follow-up from here.",00:38:34.400,00:38:40.340
"But since you will
have a problem set,",00:38:40.340,00:38:42.370
I will mention one other thing.,00:38:42.370,00:38:46.150
"That this reorganization of
the series that I made here",00:38:46.150,00:38:50.640
"is appropriate to the limit
of low densities, where",00:38:50.640,00:38:54.220
"I would have a nice expansion
in powers of density.",00:38:54.220,00:38:58.950
"The problem that
you will deal with",00:38:58.950,00:39:01.100
"has to do with plasmas,
where the interaction",00:39:01.100,00:39:04.370
range is very large.,00:39:04.370,00:39:06.350
"And you already saw
something along those lines",00:39:06.350,00:39:09.710
"when we had the Vlasov
equation as opposed",00:39:09.710,00:39:12.350
to Boltzmann equation.,00:39:12.350,00:39:13.900
"There was a regime where
you had to reorganize",00:39:13.900,00:39:16.450
the series different ways.,00:39:16.450,00:39:17.970
"In that case, it was
the BBGKY hierarchy",00:39:17.970,00:39:21.720
"whether you were looking at the
dense limit or a dilute limit.",00:39:21.720,00:39:25.205
"So this is the analog of where
the Boltzmann equation would",00:39:25.205,00:39:28.890
have been inappropriate.,00:39:28.890,00:39:30.640
"The analog of the
regime where you",00:39:30.640,00:39:32.550
"are dense and something
like the Vlasov equation",00:39:32.550,00:39:43.020
would be appropriate.,00:39:43.020,00:39:44.550
"So there is some kind
of interaction range,",00:39:44.550,00:39:47.150
"n d cubed if it is
much larger than 1.",00:39:47.150,00:39:50.770
"Then it turns out that rather
than looking at diagrams that",00:39:50.770,00:39:55.100
"have the fewest number of
points-- in this case, 2--",00:39:55.100,00:39:58.630
"you have to look
at diagrams that",00:39:58.630,00:40:00.420
"have the largest
number of points.",00:40:00.420,00:40:02.570
"Because each additional
point will give you",00:40:02.570,00:40:05.200
"an additional
factor of N over V.",00:40:05.200,00:40:07.960
"You can see that these
factors of N N minus 1 over 2",00:40:07.960,00:40:13.140
"came from the number of
points that I had selected.",00:40:13.140,00:40:15.810
"So if I had to
select three points,",00:40:15.810,00:40:17.850
"I would have N cubed and the
corresponding V. So the more",00:40:17.850,00:40:23.100
"points that I have
in my series, I",00:40:23.100,00:40:25.010
"will have more powers
of the density.",00:40:25.010,00:40:27.540
"So in that case, it
turns out that rather",00:40:27.540,00:40:29.870
"than looking at two points
and all lines between them,",00:40:29.870,00:40:33.910
"you organize things
in terms of what",00:40:33.910,00:40:36.040
"are called ring
diagrams, which are",00:40:36.040,00:40:40.910
"things such as this, this, this.",00:40:40.910,00:40:46.330
"So basically, for a
given number of lines,",00:40:46.330,00:40:54.090
"the most number of points is
obtained by creating your ring.",00:40:54.090,00:40:59.270
"And so one of the
problems that you have",00:40:59.270,00:41:03.980
"is to sort of sum these ring
diagrams and see what happens.",00:41:03.980,00:41:07.510
"But it seems like what
I'm telling you here",00:41:13.900,00:41:17.150
"is while we calculated
order of density squared,",00:41:17.150,00:41:20.100
"but maybe I want to calculate
order of density cubed.",00:41:20.100,00:41:23.370
"And it makes much more
sense rather than when",00:41:23.370,00:41:27.180
"faced with potentials
of this form arranging",00:41:27.180,00:41:30.910
"the series in powers of
the potential to arrange it",00:41:30.910,00:41:34.310
"in powers of this quantity e
to the minus beta V minus 1.",00:41:34.310,00:41:40.490
"So let's go through a
route in which I directly",00:41:40.490,00:41:45.640
"expand everything in
terms of this quantity.",00:41:45.640,00:41:49.850
"And that's the second
type of expansion",00:41:49.850,00:41:55.440
"that I will call the
cluster expansion.",00:41:55.440,00:41:58.596
"So once more, what
we want to calculate",00:42:05.750,00:42:09.470
is the partition function.,00:42:09.470,00:42:11.110
"It depends on temperature,
volume, number",00:42:11.110,00:42:14.030
"of particles obtained
by integrating over",00:42:14.030,00:42:19.200
all degrees of freedom.,00:42:19.200,00:42:21.580
"The integration over momenta
we saw is very simple.",00:42:21.580,00:42:25.190
"Ultimately, will give us this
N factorial lambda to the 3N.",00:42:25.190,00:42:30.710
"This time, I won't pull
out the factor of V",00:42:30.710,00:42:33.530
to the N at this point.,00:42:33.530,00:42:36.380
"And then I have the integration
over all of these q's.",00:42:36.380,00:42:43.130
"I did not divide by
V because I did not",00:42:43.130,00:42:46.180
multiply by V to the N. OK.,00:42:46.180,00:42:51.030
"And then I have e
to the minus beta U,",00:42:51.030,00:42:54.170
"but this is my U. U is
the sum of various terms.",00:42:54.170,00:43:00.190
"So e to the minus beta U
will be a product over all,",00:43:00.190,00:43:06.630
"let's say-- let's
call this k pairs ij.",00:43:06.630,00:43:15.068
"e to the minus beta
V of qi minus qj.",00:43:15.068,00:43:20.480
"So basically, the
only thing that I did",00:43:23.380,00:43:27.020
"was e to the minus
beta-- this quantity",00:43:27.020,00:43:29.860
"I wrote as a product
of contributions",00:43:29.860,00:43:32.220
from the different pairs.,00:43:32.220,00:43:33.400
"Now, this quantity I have
it in the line above.",00:43:38.490,00:43:42.810
"This is also a
relative position.",00:43:42.810,00:43:45.560
"Clearly, I can
think of this as 1",00:43:45.560,00:43:50.650
"plus the f that would correspond
to the distance between qi",00:43:50.650,00:43:55.420
and qj.,00:43:55.420,00:43:57.310
"And again, I can either write
it as Vf of qi minus qj,",00:43:57.310,00:44:02.510
"or simplify of i-- my notation--
and write it as f i j.",00:44:02.510,00:44:07.630
"So f i j means-- so let
me maybe write it here.",00:44:07.630,00:44:13.900
"f i j I have defined to
be e to the minus beta",00:44:13.900,00:44:18.020
V of qi minus qj minus 1.,00:44:18.020,00:44:21.518
So what do I expect?,00:44:28.190,00:44:31.210
"I saw that the first
correction to something",00:44:31.210,00:44:33.760
"that was interesting to me
had one power of f in it",00:44:33.760,00:44:39.150
"that I had to
ultimately integrate.",00:44:39.150,00:44:41.480
"So maybe what I should do is I
should start organizing things",00:44:41.480,00:44:46.410
in terms of how many f's I have.,00:44:46.410,00:44:49.520
So an expansion in powers of f.,00:44:49.520,00:44:52.970
So what's going to happen here?,00:44:52.970,00:44:54.610
"I would have 1 over N
factorial lambda to the 3N.",00:44:54.610,00:44:59.100
"I have a product of all
of the integrations.",00:44:59.100,00:45:05.460
"And I have all of these
factors of 1 plus f1 2 times 1.",00:45:05.460,00:45:10.010
"So basically, this is maybe--
it's really a product of 1",00:45:10.010,00:45:15.240
"plus f1 2, 1 plus f1 3, 1 plus
all of one of these things.",00:45:15.240,00:45:20.460
"So the thing that has
least number of f's is",00:45:20.460,00:45:23.690
"when I pick the 1 from
all of these brackets",00:45:23.690,00:45:26.570
that are multiplying each other.,00:45:26.570,00:45:29.240
"The next term is to
pick 1f from one pair",00:45:29.240,00:45:37.690
and all the others would be 1.,00:45:37.690,00:45:40.580
"The next term would be sum
over ij kl f i j f k l,",00:45:40.580,00:45:49.840
"and then there will be diagrams
that would progressively",00:45:49.840,00:45:53.270
have more and more factors of f.,00:45:53.270,00:45:55.790
"Now, what I will do is to
represent the various terms",00:46:05.670,00:46:09.350
"that I generate in this
series diagrammatically.",00:46:09.350,00:46:11.546
"So first of all, I have to
integrate over N points.",00:46:25.440,00:46:30.790
"So I put points 1 through
N. So I have 1, 2, 3, 4.",00:46:30.790,00:46:43.925
"It doesn't matter
how I put them-- N.",00:46:43.925,00:46:48.980
"And then, this 1
would correspond",00:46:48.980,00:46:53.840
to just this diagram.,00:46:53.840,00:46:56.970
"The next thing is I
put a line for f i j.",00:46:56.970,00:47:03.330
"So let's say that I
picked in this series",00:47:03.330,00:47:05.700
the term that was f 2 3.,00:47:05.700,00:47:07.400
"I will represent that by a
line that goes between 2 and 3.",00:47:07.400,00:47:13.180
"Later on in the
picture, maybe I will",00:47:13.180,00:47:16.930
pick a term that is f 2 3 f 4 5.,00:47:16.930,00:47:21.580
"So some second-order term
could be something like this.",00:47:21.580,00:47:26.130
"Maybe later on in
the series, I will",00:47:26.130,00:47:28.510
"pick a term that is
connecting f3 and f4.",00:47:28.510,00:47:31.120
"So this would be a third-order
term in the series.",00:47:31.120,00:47:34.760
"Maybe later on the series, I
have some other pair over here.",00:47:34.760,00:47:40.540
"So any one of the
huge number of terms",00:47:40.540,00:47:44.870
"that I have generated
here has one diagram",00:47:44.870,00:47:48.460
that is appearing over here.,00:47:48.460,00:47:50.020
"Now, the next step is, of course
I have to integrate over all",00:47:53.120,00:47:56.630
of the q's.,00:47:56.630,00:47:57.440
"I mean, these diagrams, what
they represent is essentially",00:47:57.440,00:48:00.520
"some f of q1 minus q3,
some f of whatever.",00:48:00.520,00:48:04.130
"And I have to integrate
over all of these q's.",00:48:04.130,00:48:07.570
"So the contribution to
the partition function",00:48:07.570,00:48:11.290
"that I will get would
be some value associated",00:48:11.290,00:48:14.770
"with one of these
graphs obtained by doing",00:48:14.770,00:48:17.140
the integrations over q.,00:48:17.140,00:48:18.420
"Now, the thing that
I want you to notice",00:48:21.560,00:48:24.870
"is that contribution of one
of these graphs or diagrams",00:48:24.870,00:48:38.760
"is the product of contributions
of its linked clusters.",00:48:38.760,00:48:50.640
"So here I have one
particular diagram",00:48:59.190,00:49:02.910
that is represented here.,00:49:02.910,00:49:04.350
"Well, let's say 2, 3,
4, 5 are linked together",00:49:04.350,00:49:10.390
"and separate from
whatever this is.",00:49:10.390,00:49:12.460
"Let's say this is 7, 9.",00:49:12.460,00:49:13.950
"So when I do the integrations
over q2, q3, q4, q5,",00:49:16.640,00:49:21.520
"I don't really rely on
any of the other things.",00:49:21.520,00:49:25.530
"So my integration
here, we break off",00:49:25.530,00:49:28.120
"into the integration
that involves",00:49:28.120,00:49:29.760
"this, the integration that
involves this, as well",00:49:29.760,00:49:32.690
"as integrations over
all of these points",00:49:32.690,00:49:35.060
"that are not
connected to anybody.",00:49:35.060,00:49:36.650
"All of those will simply
give me a factor of v.",00:49:36.650,00:49:41.520
"So is everybody happy
with this simple statement",00:49:41.520,00:49:45.110
"that the contribution-- if I
think of these linked clusters",00:49:45.110,00:49:49.070
"as some collection of points
that are linked together,",00:49:49.070,00:49:52.940
"the value that I would
get for this diagram",00:49:52.940,00:49:55.100
"would be the contribution--
product of the contributions",00:49:55.100,00:49:58.365
that I would have for this.,00:49:58.365,00:49:59.490
So yes?,00:50:04.060,00:50:05.590
"AUDIENCE: Can you
explain [INAUDIBLE]?",00:50:05.590,00:50:07.417
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:50:07.417,00:50:08.000
"So let's pick a
particular thing.",00:50:08.000,00:50:13.060
"Let's say we do
something like this,",00:50:13.060,00:50:16.510
"where this is number
7, 245, 6, 5, 4.",00:50:16.510,00:50:25.795
This is a particular thing.,00:50:25.795,00:50:26.920
So what do I have to do?,00:50:26.920,00:50:28.230
"There's also a whole
bunch of points-- 1, 2, 3.",00:50:28.230,00:50:33.020
"What I am instructed to
do is to integrate over",00:50:33.020,00:50:36.980
"q1, q2, q3, et cetera.",00:50:36.980,00:50:44.490
"Now, the integral over q1
is just the integral of q1.",00:50:44.490,00:50:49.240
"So this integral by
itself will give me",00:50:49.240,00:50:52.110
"V. Any number of points
that are by themselves",00:50:52.110,00:50:57.190
"will also give me
V. So the first term",00:50:57.190,00:51:02.950
"that becomes
nontrivial is when I",00:51:02.950,00:51:04.870
"have to do the integration over
q4, q5, q6 of f 4 5, f 5 6,",00:51:04.870,00:51:23.020
f 6 4.,00:51:23.020,00:51:24.010
"I don't know what
this is, but there",00:51:26.990,00:51:31.350
"is something that
will come from here.",00:51:31.350,00:51:33.960
"Then, later on I have
to integrate over 7",00:51:33.960,00:51:37.570
and something else.,00:51:37.570,00:51:39.310
"So then I have the integral
over q7, q-- let's call this 8.",00:51:39.310,00:51:44.652
f of 7 8.,00:51:49.380,00:51:50.760
So this is something else.,00:51:50.760,00:51:53.910
"So the overall value of this
term in the perturbation theory",00:51:53.910,00:51:59.460
"is the product of contributions
from a huge number of one",00:51:59.460,00:52:02.800
clusters.,00:52:02.800,00:52:04.690
"Here, I have a two cluster.",00:52:04.690,00:52:06.070
"Here, I have a three cluster.",00:52:06.070,00:52:07.740
Maybe I will have more things.,00:52:07.740,00:52:09.360
"Also, notice that if I have
more of these two clusters,",00:52:13.410,00:52:20.140
"the result for them would
be exactly the same.",00:52:20.140,00:52:24.350
"So if I have lots of these
pairs, the same way that I",00:52:24.350,00:52:27.550
"had lots of single
points-- and it became V",00:52:27.550,00:52:30.080
"to the number of
single points-- it",00:52:30.080,00:52:32.020
"will become whatever that
y is to the number of pair",00:52:32.020,00:52:34.820
"points, x, whatever that is,
to the number of triplets",00:52:34.820,00:52:38.530
that I have in triangles.,00:52:38.530,00:52:40.680
"So this is how this
object is built up.",00:52:40.680,00:52:44.970
Yes?,00:52:44.970,00:52:45.680
"AUDIENCE: How are we
deciding how many triplets",00:52:45.680,00:52:48.580
"and how many pairs
we actually have?",00:52:48.580,00:52:51.226
"PROFESSOR: At this point,
I haven't told you.",00:52:51.226,00:52:53.100
"So there is a multiplicity
that we have to calculate.",00:52:53.100,00:52:55.940
Yes.,00:52:55.940,00:52:57.500
"So at this point, all
I'm saying is given",00:52:57.500,00:53:00.080
"this, the answer is the
product of contribution.",00:53:00.080,00:53:03.099
"There is a multiplicity
factor-- you're right.",00:53:03.099,00:53:05.015
We have to calculate that.,00:53:05.015,00:53:07.185
OK?,00:53:09.980,00:53:11.780
Anything else?,00:53:11.780,00:53:14.715
All right.,00:53:14.715,00:53:16.040
"So I mean, think of
this as taking a number",00:53:16.040,00:53:21.300
"and writing it as the
product of its prime factors,",00:53:21.300,00:53:24.850
factorizing into primes.,00:53:24.850,00:53:27.500
"So you sort of immediately know
that somehow prime factors,",00:53:27.500,00:53:31.770
"the prime numbers,
are more important.",00:53:31.770,00:53:34.730
"Because everything else you
can write as prime numbers.",00:53:34.730,00:53:37.920
"So clearly, what is
also buried in heart",00:53:37.920,00:53:40.530
"of calculating this partition
function is these clusters.",00:53:40.530,00:53:46.610
"So let me define the analog
of prime numbers as follows.",00:53:46.610,00:53:56.950
"I define bl to be the
sum over contributions",00:53:56.950,00:54:08.870
"of all linked
clusters of l-points.",00:54:08.870,00:54:17.430
So let's go term by term.,00:54:39.350,00:54:42.050
"b1 corresponds essentially
to the one point",00:54:42.050,00:54:46.480
"by itself in the diagram
that I was drawing down here.",00:54:46.480,00:54:50.460
"And corresponds to
integrating over",00:54:50.460,00:54:53.970
"the coordinate that
goes all over the space.",00:54:53.970,00:54:56.890
"And hence, the volume is the
same thing as the volume V.",00:54:56.890,00:55:03.330
b2 is a cluster of two points.,00:55:03.330,00:55:08.810
So it is this.,00:55:08.810,00:55:11.160
"And so it is the
integral over q1 and q2,",00:55:11.160,00:55:16.300
"which are two endpoints of
this, of f of q1 minus q2.",00:55:16.300,00:55:24.910
"And this we have seen
already many times.",00:55:24.910,00:55:27.430
"It's the same thing as volume,
the integral over q f of q.",00:55:27.430,00:55:33.550
"It is the thing that was
related to our second Virial",00:55:33.550,00:55:36.270
coefficient.,00:55:36.270,00:55:36.770
"Now, this is very
important for b3.",00:55:40.040,00:55:43.600
"I note that I
underlined here ""all.""",00:55:46.640,00:55:52.040
"And this is for
later convenience.",00:55:52.040,00:55:54.580
"It seems that I'm essentially
pushing complexity",00:55:54.580,00:55:57.610
from one place to another.,00:55:57.610,00:56:00.080
"So there are a
number of diagrams",00:56:00.080,00:56:03.090
"that have three things
linked together.",00:56:03.090,00:56:08.130
This is one of them.,00:56:08.130,00:56:09.440
"Let's say, think of 1, 2,
3 connected to each other.",00:56:09.440,00:56:14.380
"But then, I have diagrams.",00:56:14.380,00:56:16.920
"At this stage, I
don't really care",00:56:16.920,00:56:19.380
"that this is one
particle irreducible.",00:56:19.380,00:56:22.430
"Here, I have no constraints on
one particle irreducibility.",00:56:22.430,00:56:26.800
"And in fact, this comes
in three varieties",00:56:26.800,00:56:29.710
"because the bond that is
missing can be one of three.",00:56:29.710,00:56:33.640
"So once I pick the triplets
of three points, sum",00:56:33.640,00:56:38.040
"over all clusters that involve
these three points is this,",00:56:38.040,00:56:42.360
"in particular with this
one, appearing three times.",00:56:42.360,00:56:45.560
Yes.,00:56:45.560,00:56:46.283
"AUDIENCE: Do we still
count all the diagrams",00:56:46.283,00:56:48.116
when particles are identical?,00:56:48.116,00:56:49.990
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:56:49.990,00:56:51.220
"Because here, at
this stage, there",00:56:51.220,00:56:56.230
is an N factorial out here.,00:56:56.230,00:56:57.830
"All I'm really doing
is transcribing",00:56:57.830,00:57:00.410
a mathematical formula.,00:57:00.410,00:57:02.700
"The mathematical
formula says you",00:57:02.700,00:57:04.600
"have to do a bunch
of integrations.",00:57:04.600,00:57:06.840
"And I am just
following translating",00:57:06.840,00:57:09.580
"that mathematical
formula to diagrams.",00:57:09.580,00:57:11.730
"At this stage, we forget.",00:57:11.730,00:57:13.600
"This has nothing to do with
this N factorial or identity.",00:57:13.600,00:57:17.510
"It's just a transcription
of the mathematics",00:57:17.510,00:57:24.990
"So at this stage, don't try
to correct my conceptual parts",00:57:24.990,00:57:31.710
"but try to make sure that my
mathematical steps are correct.",00:57:31.710,00:57:37.090
OK?,00:57:37.090,00:57:39.115
Yes.,00:57:39.115,00:57:39.615
"AUDIENCE: I didn't
understand what",00:57:39.615,00:57:41.070
that missing links represents.,00:57:41.070,00:57:43.690
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:57:43.690,00:57:45.040
"So at the end of this story,
what I want to write down",00:57:45.040,00:57:53.340
"is that the value of some
particular term in this series",00:57:53.340,00:57:57.390
"is related to product
of contributions.",00:57:57.390,00:58:00.610
"I described to you how
productive contributions",00:58:00.610,00:58:03.360
comes along.,00:58:03.360,00:58:05.450
"And each contribution
is a bunch of points",00:58:05.450,00:58:08.880
that are connected together.,00:58:08.880,00:58:12.400
"So what I want to do, in order
to make my algebra easier",00:58:12.400,00:58:16.360
"later on, is to say
that-- let's say",00:58:16.360,00:58:19.360
"these three points
are part of a cluster.",00:58:19.360,00:58:22.760
"They are connected
together somehow.",00:58:22.760,00:58:25.320
"So they will be
giving me some factor.",00:58:25.320,00:58:28.950
"Now, they are connected, if
they are connected like this,",00:58:28.950,00:58:32.030
"like this, like this, like that.",00:58:32.030,00:58:35.360
"So basically, any
one of these is",00:58:35.360,00:58:38.080
"a way of connecting these
three points so that they",00:58:38.080,00:58:41.690
"will make a
contribution together.",00:58:41.690,00:58:43.250
Yes.,00:59:00.960,00:59:01.510
"AUDIENCE: So the one
with all three bonds",00:59:01.510,00:59:03.764
"comes with a
different [INAUDIBLE]",00:59:03.764,00:59:05.252
"in the series than the ones
with only two bonds, right?",00:59:05.252,00:59:08.200
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:59:08.200,00:59:09.030
"Now, there is
reason, ultimately,",00:59:09.030,00:59:11.020
"why I want to group
all of them together.",00:59:11.020,00:59:15.300
"Because there was a
question before about",00:59:15.300,00:59:17.760
multiplicity factors.,00:59:17.760,00:59:19.980
"I can write down a closed
form, nice expression",00:59:19.980,00:59:23.190
"for the multiplicity factor
if I group them together.",00:59:23.190,00:59:27.320
"Otherwise, I have to also worry
that there are three of these",00:59:27.320,00:59:30.660
"and there is one
of them, et cetera.",00:59:30.660,00:59:32.650
"There is an additional
layer of multiplicity.",00:59:32.650,00:59:36.220
"And I want to separate those
two layers of multiplicity.",00:59:36.220,00:59:40.140
"So here, the thing that I have
is I have these endpoints.",00:59:40.140,00:59:46.140
"I want to say that the
eventual result for endpoints",00:59:46.140,00:59:49.870
"comes from clusters that
involves 1's, clusters that",00:59:49.870,00:59:55.630
"involve pairs, and cluster
that involve triplets.",00:59:55.630,01:00:01.350
"Now, I realize suddenly that if
I made the multiplicity count",01:00:01.350,01:00:05.010
"here, then for this triplet,
I could have put all of them",01:00:05.010,01:00:10.140
together like this or like that.,01:00:10.140,01:00:12.440
"And the next order
of business when",01:00:12.440,01:00:14.190
"I am thinking
about four objects,",01:00:14.190,01:00:17.330
"I can connect them together
into a cluster in multiple ways.",01:00:17.330,01:00:21.440
"And there is a separate
way of calculating",01:00:21.440,01:00:25.350
"the relative
multiplicity of what",01:00:25.350,01:00:27.370
"comes outside and the
multiplicity of this quartic",01:00:27.370,01:00:31.650
with respect to entirety.,01:00:31.650,01:00:33.040
"So you have to think
about this a little bit.",01:00:36.690,01:00:39.350
So I'll proceed with this.,01:00:39.350,01:00:44.240
"So this mathematically would
be the integral q1, q2, q3, f",01:00:44.240,01:00:53.640
"1 2, f 2 3, f 3 1 plus, say,
f 1 2, f 2 3, plus f 1 3 f 3 2",01:00:53.640,01:01:05.310
"plus f 2 3, f 3 1,
something like this.",01:01:05.310,01:01:11.250
"Well, 1, 2.",01:01:14.080,01:01:17.230
2 is repeated.,01:01:17.230,01:01:17.945
3 is repeated.,01:01:17.945,01:01:18.750
I should repeat 1.,01:01:18.750,01:01:20.026
OK.,01:01:24.130,01:01:24.780
"Of course, the last
three are the same thing,",01:01:24.780,01:01:26.960
"but this is the
expression for this.",01:01:26.960,01:01:29.630
"Now, before would be a
huge complex of things.",01:01:29.630,01:01:34.340
"It would have a diagram
that is of this form.",01:01:34.340,01:01:37.060
"It would have a number of
diagrams that are of this form.",01:01:37.060,01:01:40.720
"It would have diagrams that
are of this form, diagrams",01:01:40.720,01:01:44.540
"that are like
this, and so forth.",01:01:44.540,01:01:49.250
"Basically, even
within the choice",01:01:49.250,01:01:53.600
"of things that
have four clusters,",01:01:53.600,01:01:55.470
"there is a huge
number when you go",01:01:55.470,01:01:57.760
"to further and
further [? down. ?]",01:01:57.760,01:01:59.975
"OK, so maybe this statement
will now clarify things.",01:02:12.870,01:02:20.340
"So what I have is that
the partition function",01:02:20.340,01:02:26.510
"is 1 over N factorial
lambda to the 3N.",01:02:26.510,01:02:30.650
"And then it is all
of the terms that",01:02:33.380,01:02:42.440
"are obtained by
summing this series.",01:02:42.440,01:02:44.890
"And so I have to look
at all possible ways",01:02:47.450,01:02:54.170
"that I can break N-points
into these clusters.",01:02:54.170,01:02:59.235
"Suppose I created a situation
where I have clusters of size l",01:03:01.880,01:03:14.330
and then I have nl of them.,01:03:14.330,01:03:16.100
"So I saw that the contribution
that I would get from the 1",01:03:19.120,01:03:26.120
"clusters was
essentially the product",01:03:26.120,01:03:28.430
of the number of 1 clusters.,01:03:28.430,01:03:29.650
"It was V to the
number of points that",01:03:29.650,01:03:31.830
are not connected together.,01:03:31.830,01:03:34.250
"So I have to take b1, raise
it to the power of N1,",01:03:34.250,01:03:38.290
"which is the number
of 1 cluster.",01:03:38.290,01:03:41.040
"Then, I have to do the same
thing for b2, b3, et cetera.",01:03:41.040,01:03:47.240
"And then I have to
make sure that I",01:03:47.240,01:03:50.160
"have looked at all
ways of partitioning",01:03:50.160,01:03:54.580
"N the numbers into
these clusters.",01:03:54.580,01:03:56.860
"So I have a sum over nl
l has to add up to n.",01:03:56.860,01:04:02.470
"And I have to sum
over all nl's that are",01:04:02.470,01:04:06.130
consistent with this constraint.,01:04:06.130,01:04:09.060
"But then there is this
issue of the multiplicity.",01:04:11.650,01:04:15.750
"Given that I chose some
articular set of these,",01:04:15.750,01:04:21.166
"if I were to
reorganize the numbers,",01:04:21.166,01:04:26.930
"I would get the
same contribution.",01:04:26.930,01:04:29.130
"So let's say we pick
this diagram that",01:04:29.130,01:04:32.210
"has precisely a
contribution that",01:04:32.210,01:04:34.320
"is V, which is b1 to the
number of these one points.",01:04:34.320,01:04:39.580
"This to the number
of b2 to the power",01:04:39.580,01:04:43.520
"of the number of
these, this, et cetera.",01:04:43.520,01:04:46.290
"But then I can take these
labels-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,",01:04:46.290,01:04:50.100
"6-- that I assigned to these
things and permute them.",01:04:50.100,01:04:54.270
"If I permute them, I will get
exactly the same contribution.",01:04:54.270,01:04:58.510
"So there is a large
number of diagrams",01:04:58.510,01:05:03.310
"that have exactly this
same contribution because",01:05:03.310,01:05:05.990
of this permutation.,01:05:05.990,01:05:06.990
There was a question back there.,01:05:06.990,01:05:09.230
"AUDIENCE: You've
already answered it.",01:05:09.230,01:05:11.086
PROFESSOR: All right.,01:05:15.165,01:05:16.040
"Actually, this is an
interesting thing--",01:05:19.120,01:05:21.060
"I don't know how many
of you recognize this.",01:05:21.060,01:05:23.170
"So essentially, I have
to take a huge number, N,",01:05:23.170,01:05:27.840
"and break it into a number
of 1 clusters, 2 clusters, et",01:05:27.840,01:05:31.210
cetera.,01:05:31.210,01:05:32.460
"The number of ways
of doing that is",01:05:32.460,01:05:34.360
"called a partition
of an integer.",01:05:34.360,01:05:36.700
"And last century,
the [INAUDIBLE]",01:05:36.700,01:05:41.520
calculated what that number is.,01:05:41.520,01:05:43.370
"So there is a [INAUDIBLE]
theorem associated with that.",01:05:43.370,01:05:47.160
"And actually,
later in the course",01:05:47.160,01:05:48.740
"I will give you a
problem to calculate",01:05:48.740,01:05:50.930
"the asymptotic version
of the [INAUDIBLE].",01:05:50.930,01:05:53.445
But this is different story.,01:05:57.160,01:05:58.390
"So given that you had made
one of these partitions",01:05:58.390,01:06:01.830
"of this integer, what is
this degeneracy factor?",01:06:01.830,01:06:05.950
"So let me tell you what
this degeneracy factor is.",01:06:05.950,01:06:09.090
"So given this
choice of nl's, you",01:06:09.090,01:06:13.960
"say-- well, the first
thing is what I told you.",01:06:13.960,01:06:18.550
"For a particular
graph, the value",01:06:18.550,01:06:21.690
"is independent of how these
numbers were assigned.",01:06:21.690,01:06:26.320
"So I will permute those
numbers in all possible ways",01:06:26.320,01:06:29.540
and I will get the same thing.,01:06:29.540,01:06:31.630
"So that will give
me N factorial.",01:06:31.630,01:06:33.272
It's the number of permutations.,01:06:33.272,01:06:34.605
"But then, I have over-counted
things because within,",01:06:37.130,01:06:41.860
"let's say, a 2 cluster--
if I count 7, 8, 8,",01:06:41.860,01:06:45.850
7 they are the same thing.,01:06:45.850,01:06:47.370
"And by multiplying
by this N factorial,",01:06:47.370,01:06:50.520
I have over-counted that.,01:06:50.520,01:06:53.320
"So I have to divide by 2 for
every one of my 2 clusters.",01:06:53.320,01:06:58.990
"So I have to divide by
2 to the power of N2.",01:06:58.990,01:07:04.750
"For the 3 clusters, I have
the permutation of everything",01:07:04.750,01:07:07.700
that is inside.,01:07:07.700,01:07:08.330
So it is 3 factor here.,01:07:08.330,01:07:10.930
"So what I have here
is I have to divide",01:07:10.930,01:07:14.050
"by the over-counting, which
is l factorial-- labels",01:07:14.050,01:07:21.020
"within a cluster-- to
the number of clusters",01:07:21.020,01:07:24.740
"that I have that
are subject to this.",01:07:24.740,01:07:27.790
"There is another thing that this
pair is 100, 101 and this pair",01:07:30.830,01:07:40.195
"is 7, 8.",01:07:40.195,01:07:42.280
"Exchanging that pair of numbers
with that pair of numbers",01:07:42.280,01:07:46.310
"is also part of the symmetries
that I have now over-counted.",01:07:46.310,01:07:50.960
"So that has to be
taken into account",01:07:50.960,01:07:54.210
"because the number of
these 2 clusters here is 2.",01:07:54.210,01:07:59.630
Here is actually 3.,01:07:59.630,01:08:00.790
I have to divide by 3 factorial.,01:08:00.790,01:08:03.050
"In general, I have to
divide by nl factorial.",01:08:03.050,01:08:06.406
OK.,01:08:10.300,01:08:11.490
"Again, this is one
of those things",01:08:11.490,01:08:14.810
"that the best advice that I
can give you is to draw five",01:08:14.810,01:08:19.580
"or six points so
your n is small.",01:08:19.580,01:08:22.890
And draw some diagrams.,01:08:22.890,01:08:25.430
"And convince yourself
that what I told you",01:08:25.430,01:08:27.640
here rapidly is correct.,01:08:27.640,01:08:30.510
And it is correct.,01:08:30.510,01:08:32.590
Yes.,01:08:35.192,01:08:35.691
"AUDIENCE: Can you just clarify
which is in the [INAUDIBLE]?",01:08:35.691,01:08:38.517
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:08:38.517,01:08:39.100
So the N factorial is outside.,01:08:39.100,01:08:41.700
"And then-- so maybe
write it better.",01:08:41.700,01:08:44.290
"For each l, I have to
multiply nl factorial and l",01:08:44.290,01:08:49.819
factorial to the power of nl.,01:08:49.819,01:08:52.422
"So this is my partition function
in terms of these clusters.",01:09:04.020,01:09:07.954
"Even with all of
these definitions",01:09:10.760,01:09:13.270
"that I have up there, maybe
not so obvious an answer.",01:09:13.270,01:09:18.670
"And one of the reason it is
kind of an obscure answer",01:09:18.670,01:09:22.590
"is because here I have
to do a constrained sum.",01:09:22.590,01:09:28.240
"That is, I have all
of these variables.",01:09:28.240,01:09:31.870
"Let's call them n1,
n2, n3, et cetera.",01:09:31.870,01:09:38.220
"Each one of them can
go from 0, 1, 2, 3.",01:09:38.220,01:09:42.920
"But they are all
linked to each other",01:09:42.920,01:09:44.890
"because their sum is kind of
restricted by some total value",01:09:44.890,01:09:49.399
"l, by this constraint.",01:09:49.399,01:09:52.500
"And constrained
sums are hard to do.",01:09:52.500,01:09:57.530
"But in statistical
physics, we know",01:09:57.530,01:10:00.310
"how to gets rid of
constrained sums.",01:10:00.310,01:10:03.170
"The way that we do
that is we essentially",01:10:03.170,01:10:06.290
allow this N to go all the way.,01:10:06.290,01:10:09.560
"So if I say, let's make--
it's very hard for me",01:10:09.560,01:10:13.420
"to do this n1 from
0 to something,",01:10:13.420,01:10:15.560
"n2 from 0 to something with
all of this constrained.",01:10:15.560,01:10:19.760
"My life would be very easier
if I could independently",01:10:19.760,01:10:22.800
"have n1 go take any
value, n2 take any value,",01:10:22.800,01:10:26.080
n3 take any value.,01:10:26.080,01:10:28.450
"But if I do that essentially
for each choice of n1, n2, n3,",01:10:28.450,01:10:32.570
"I have shifted the
value of big N.",01:10:32.570,01:10:38.010
"But there is an
ensemble that I know",01:10:38.010,01:10:39.970
"which has possibly
any value of N,",01:10:39.970,01:10:42.650
and that's the grand canonical.,01:10:42.650,01:10:44.044
"So rather than looking at
the partition function,",01:10:50.820,01:10:54.810
"I say I will look at the
grand partition function",01:10:54.810,01:10:57.840
"Q that is obtained
by summing over",01:10:57.840,01:11:01.920
"all N. Can take any
value from 0 to infinity.",01:11:01.920,01:11:06.470
"I have e to the beta mu N times
the partition function that",01:11:06.470,01:11:12.280
is for N particles.,01:11:12.280,01:11:13.395
"So that's the definition of how
you would go from the canonical",01:11:16.750,01:11:21.130
"where you have fixed
N to grand canonical",01:11:21.130,01:11:23.260
"where you have fixed the
chemical potential mu.",01:11:23.260,01:11:27.630
"So let's apply this
sum over there.",01:11:27.630,01:11:31.620
"I have a sum over N, but
I said that if I allowed",01:11:31.620,01:11:36.690
"the nl's to vary
independently, it",01:11:36.690,01:11:40.940
"is equivalent to varying
that N, recognizing",01:11:40.940,01:11:45.480
that this n is sum over l l nl.,01:11:45.480,01:11:50.019
That's the constraint.,01:11:50.019,01:11:50.935
So that's just the first term.,01:11:54.140,01:11:55.800
"I have rewritten this sum that
was constrained and this sum",01:11:55.800,01:12:01.000
"over the total number as
independent sums over the nl's.",01:12:01.000,01:12:05.370
Got rid of the constraint.,01:12:05.370,01:12:06.640
"Now, I write W. Oh, OK.",01:12:09.570,01:12:12.290
The partition function.,01:12:12.290,01:12:13.404
"Now, write the
partition function.",01:12:13.404,01:12:14.820
I have 1 over N factorial.,01:12:14.820,01:12:18.680
"I have lambda cubed
raised to this power.",01:12:18.680,01:12:21.240
"So actually, let me put
this in this fashion.",01:12:21.240,01:12:25.980
"So both e to the
beta mu over lambda",01:12:25.980,01:12:28.470
"cubed that is raised
to that power.",01:12:28.470,01:12:31.090
"OK, so that's that part.",01:12:31.090,01:12:33.310
The sum I have gotten rid of.,01:12:33.310,01:12:36.140
"I notice that my W
has an N factorial.",01:12:36.140,01:12:40.350
"So this is the N factorial
that came from here.",01:12:40.350,01:12:43.160
"But then there is an N factorial
that is up here from the W.",01:12:45.670,01:12:49.790
"So the two of them will cancel
each other, N factorial.",01:12:49.790,01:12:54.440
"And then I have a product
over all clusters.",01:12:54.440,01:13:00.770
"Part of it is this bl
to the power of nl,",01:13:00.770,01:13:04.980
"and then I have the contribution
that is nl factorial l",01:13:04.980,01:13:08.790
factorial to the power of nl.,01:13:08.790,01:13:10.236
So this part cancels.,01:13:15.930,01:13:17.150
"For each l, I can
now independently",01:13:19.840,01:13:25.360
"sum over the values of nl can
be anything, 0 to infinity.",01:13:25.360,01:13:31.910
And what do I have?,01:13:31.910,01:13:33.762
I have bl to the power of nl.,01:13:33.762,01:13:39.650
I have division by nl factorial.,01:13:39.650,01:13:43.790
"I have l factorial
to the power of nl.",01:13:43.790,01:13:48.630
"And then I have e to the beta
mu over lambda cubed raised",01:13:48.630,01:13:55.920
to the power of l nl.,01:13:55.920,01:13:57.431
"I recognize that each one
of these terms in the sum",01:14:08.500,01:14:12.650
"is 1 over nl factorial something
raised to the power of nl,",01:14:12.650,01:14:19.150
"which is the definition
of the exponential.",01:14:19.150,01:14:22.240
"So my q is a product
over all l's.",01:14:22.240,01:14:27.880
"Once I exponentiate, I
have e to the beta mu",01:14:27.880,01:14:35.690
"over lambda cubed raised
to the power of l.",01:14:35.690,01:14:42.380
"And then I have bl
divided by l factorial.",01:14:42.380,01:14:46.890
"Or, log of Q, which is the
quantity that I'm interested,",01:14:53.080,01:14:59.770
"is obtained by summing
over all clusters 1",01:14:59.770,01:15:04.240
"to infinity e to the beta
mu over lambda cubed raised",01:15:04.240,01:15:11.290
"to the power of l bl
divided by l factorial.",01:15:11.290,01:15:16.366
"So what does this
tell us, which is",01:15:26.840,01:15:30.330
"kind of nice and
fundamentally important?",01:15:30.330,01:15:34.050
"You see, we started at
the beginning over here",01:15:34.050,01:15:38.110
with a huge number of graphs.,01:15:38.110,01:15:40.510
"These graphs could be organizing
all kinds of clusters.",01:15:43.280,01:15:49.240
"And they would give us
either the partition function",01:15:49.240,01:15:51.980
"or summing over N, the
grand partition function.",01:15:51.980,01:15:56.700
"But when we take the log, I get
only single connect objects.",01:15:56.700,01:16:05.230
"And this is something
that you had already",01:16:05.230,01:16:07.510
"seen as the connection
that we have",01:16:07.510,01:16:10.440
between moments and Cumulants.,01:16:10.440,01:16:13.750
"So the way that we
got Cumulants was",01:16:13.750,01:16:17.010
"to look at the
expansion of the log.",01:16:17.010,01:16:19.860
"So the function itself was
the generator of all moments",01:16:19.860,01:16:23.250
and we took the log.,01:16:23.250,01:16:24.830
"And graphically,
we presented that",01:16:24.830,01:16:26.990
"as getting the moments
by putting together",01:16:26.990,01:16:29.480
"all kinds of clusters of points
that corresponded to Cumulants.",01:16:29.480,01:16:34.920
"And this is again,
a representation",01:16:34.920,01:16:37.300
of the same thing.,01:16:37.300,01:16:38.660
"That is, in the log
you have essentially",01:16:38.660,01:16:41.490
individual contributions.,01:16:41.490,01:16:44.290
"Once you exponentiated, you
get multiple contributions.",01:16:44.290,01:16:49.790
"Now, the other thing is, that
if I am thinking about the gas,",01:16:49.790,01:16:54.870
"then log of Q is e
to the minus beta g.",01:16:54.870,01:17:00.730
"And g is E minus TS minus
mu N. Bur for a gas that",01:17:00.730,01:17:11.270
"has extensive properties,
E is TS mu N minus PV.",01:17:11.270,01:17:16.840
"So this is the same
thing as beta PV.",01:17:16.840,01:17:19.210
"So this quantity that
we have calculated here",01:17:22.320,01:17:25.730
"is, in fact, related
to the pressure",01:17:25.730,01:17:27.830
directly through this formula.,01:17:27.830,01:17:30.001
"And the important part or
the important observation",01:17:32.810,01:17:35.770
"is that it says that it should
be proportional to volume.",01:17:35.770,01:17:40.800
"You can see that
each one of my b's",01:17:40.800,01:17:44.170
"that I calculated here will
have one free integral.",01:17:44.170,01:17:48.500
"If you like, its center of mass.",01:17:48.500,01:17:50.010
"You can go over
the entire volume.",01:17:50.010,01:17:52.310
"So all of my b's are indeed
proportionality to volume.",01:17:52.310,01:17:58.560
"And you can see what
disaster it would",01:17:58.560,01:18:00.440
"have been if there was a term
here that was not just a linked",01:18:00.440,01:18:05.310
"cluster but product of
two linked clusters.",01:18:05.310,01:18:07.510
"Then I would have something
that would go like V squared.",01:18:07.510,01:18:10.240
It's not allowed.,01:18:10.240,01:18:12.010
"So essentially, this linked
cluster nature is also",01:18:12.010,01:18:16.970
"related to extensivity
in this sense.",01:18:16.970,01:18:19.850
"So in some sense, what I have
established here-- again,",01:18:23.350,01:18:28.620
"related to that-- is that
clearly all of my bl's",01:18:28.620,01:18:35.170
are proportional to volume.,01:18:35.170,01:18:38.650
"And I can define
something that I",01:18:38.650,01:18:40.510
"will call bl bar, which is
divide the thing by the volume.",01:18:40.510,01:18:48.540
"And then what we
have established",01:18:48.540,01:18:54.770
"is that the pressure of this
interacting gas as an expansion",01:18:54.770,01:19:03.400
"beta p, which takes this
nice, simple form, sum over l",01:19:03.400,01:19:09.142
"e to the beta mu divided
by lambda cubed bl",01:19:09.142,01:19:14.770
"bar-- the intensive part of the
contribution of these cluster--",01:19:14.770,01:19:21.580
divided by l factorial.,01:19:21.580,01:19:23.300
"This, of course, runs
from 1 to [INAUDIBLE].",01:19:23.300,01:19:26.540
Yes.,01:19:29.510,01:19:30.070
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
is raised to the l?",01:19:30.070,01:19:33.592
"PROFESSOR: Who's
asking the question?",01:19:33.592,01:19:35.133
"AUDIENCE: The term in the
parentheses is raised to the l?",01:19:35.133,01:19:37.999
PROFESSOR: Exactly.,01:19:37.999,01:19:38.790
Thank you very much.,01:19:38.790,01:19:42.120
Yes.,01:19:42.120,01:19:43.534
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,01:19:43.534,01:19:44.450
"But they don't, actually.",01:19:53.575,01:19:55.930
"Could that be true, for
example [INAUDIBLE]?",01:19:55.930,01:19:58.870
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:20:04.667,01:20:05.250
"So the triangle, I have it here.",01:20:05.250,01:20:07.750
"Integral d q1, d q2, d
Q3, f 1 2, f 2 3, f 3.",01:20:07.750,01:20:12.320
Let's write it explicitly.,01:20:12.320,01:20:14.370
"It is f of q1 minus q2, f of
q2 minus q3, f of q3 minus q1.",01:20:14.370,01:20:23.210
I call this vector x.,01:20:23.210,01:20:25.725
I call that vector y.,01:20:25.725,01:20:28.500
This vector is x plus y.,01:20:28.500,01:20:30.700
Yes.,01:20:35.310,01:20:36.109
"AUDIENCE: Does the
contribution from [INAUDIBLE]?",01:20:36.109,01:20:38.504
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:20:44.260,01:20:45.290
"So you say that I have here
an expansion for the pressure.",01:20:45.290,01:20:52.720
"I had given you previously
an expansion for pressure",01:20:52.720,01:20:55.930
"that I said is sensible, which
is this Virial expansion, which",01:20:55.930,01:20:59.240
is powers of density.,01:20:59.240,01:21:01.870
"This is not an expansion
in powers of density.",01:21:01.870,01:21:06.160
"So whether or not the
terms in this expansion",01:21:06.160,01:21:10.320
"becomes smaller or
larger will depend",01:21:10.320,01:21:13.230
on density in some indirect way.,01:21:13.230,01:21:16.490
"So my next task, which
I will do next lecture,",01:21:16.490,01:21:21.100
"is within this ensemble
I have told you",01:21:21.100,01:21:23.540
what the chemical potential is.,01:21:23.540,01:21:25.740
"Once I know what the
chemical potential is,",01:21:25.740,01:21:28.160
"I can calculate the
number of particles",01:21:28.160,01:21:30.770
as d log Q by d beta mu.,01:21:30.770,01:21:36.380
"And hence, I can calculate
what the density is.",01:21:36.380,01:21:41.640
"And so the answer for this will
also be a series in powers of e",01:21:41.640,01:21:46.390
to the beta mu.,01:21:46.390,01:21:47.980
"And what then I will do is
I will combine these two",01:21:47.980,01:21:51.280
"series to get an expansion for
pressure in powers of density,",01:21:51.280,01:21:56.620
"and then identify the
convergence of this series",01:21:56.620,01:22:00.410
"and all of that
via that procedure.",01:22:00.410,01:22:03.320
