"VICTOR COSTAN: So I'm excited
about today's recitation,",00:00:20.749,00:00:23.040
"because if I do this
right and you guys get it,",00:00:23.040,00:00:25.560
"then I can mess up every
other recitation after it.",00:00:25.560,00:00:28.750
"And you'll still get
the gist of 6.006.",00:00:28.750,00:00:31.720
"So all I have to do
is get this working.",00:00:31.720,00:00:34.700
"So most of the time
in the real world",00:00:34.700,00:00:36.760
"you're probably not going to be
coming up with new algorithms",00:00:36.760,00:00:39.580
"to do something, but rather
you'll have some code",00:00:39.580,00:00:42.080
and you want to make it faster.,00:00:42.080,00:00:43.960
"And the first step
in making it faster",00:00:43.960,00:00:45.760
"is you realize, how
does it do right now?",00:00:45.760,00:00:48.510
"How does it run, which lines
are slow, which lines are fast,",00:00:48.510,00:00:51.210
"and where you can
make improvements.",00:00:51.210,00:00:53.030
"So in lecture we talked
about the Python Cost Model",00:00:53.030,00:00:56.190
"which is what you use
to look at the code",00:00:56.190,00:00:59.100
"and figure out how much
time it takes to run.",00:00:59.100,00:01:01.590
"And we talked about
document distance,",00:01:01.590,00:01:04.069
"which is a problem
that we'll use",00:01:04.069,00:01:05.530
to practice our analysis skills.,00:01:05.530,00:01:08.180
"And this entire
recitation is all",00:01:08.180,00:01:09.860
"about looking at versions
of document distance",00:01:09.860,00:01:12.610
and analyzing them.,00:01:12.610,00:01:14.810
"So that's what we'll
do, look at Python code,",00:01:14.810,00:01:16.860
"look at Python code,
look at Python code.",00:01:16.860,00:01:19.010
"So you better have handouts,
because I can't project.",00:01:19.010,00:01:21.320
"OK, how many people remember
the document distance problem?",00:01:21.320,00:01:25.637
"You guys said you went
to lecture, right?",00:01:25.637,00:01:27.345
"OK, so very, very fast,
document distance.",00:01:30.540,00:01:33.470
I have two documents.,00:01:33.470,00:01:34.650
The fox is in the hat.,00:01:37.720,00:01:41.780
And the fox is outside.,00:01:45.990,00:01:49.930
"Document 1, document 2.",00:01:54.250,00:01:56.820
"What's the first
thing I want to do?",00:01:56.820,00:01:58.580
"So there are three operations
that Eric mentioned in lecture.",00:01:58.580,00:02:01.940
"Operation one,
take each document,",00:02:01.940,00:02:07.410
break it up into words.,00:02:07.410,00:02:08.820
Right?,00:02:08.820,00:02:10.220
This is a string.,00:02:10.220,00:02:12.610
"When I read it, then it becomes
word one, word two, word three,",00:02:12.610,00:02:15.640
"word four, so on and so forth.",00:02:15.640,00:02:18.060
"Operation two, build
document vectors",00:02:18.060,00:02:20.930
out of the two documents.,00:02:20.930,00:02:22.840
So the documents are D1 and D2.,00:02:22.840,00:02:25.790
"A document vector
is basically a list",00:02:29.080,00:02:30.950
"of the words in the documents
with a count of how many times",00:02:30.950,00:02:35.670
"each word appears
in the document.",00:02:35.670,00:02:37.870
"So let's build a document
vector for document one.",00:02:37.870,00:02:43.112
"I'm not going to
write it formally,",00:02:43.112,00:02:44.570
"so can anyone tell me
what it should look like,",00:02:44.570,00:02:47.120
"and I'll sort of write
it down as a list.",00:02:47.120,00:02:49.110
"So for all the words here,
I want to list the words",00:02:52.780,00:02:55.440
and how many times they show up.,00:02:55.440,00:02:57.640
"Somebody, please.",00:02:57.640,00:03:01.376
AUDIENCE: The is in there twice?,00:03:01.376,00:03:03.840
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.,00:03:03.840,00:03:04.970
"The, twice.",00:03:04.970,00:03:07.735
"AUDIENCE: Fox, once.",00:03:07.735,00:03:10.410
VICTOR COSTAN: One.,00:03:10.410,00:03:11.710
"AUDIENCE: Is, once.",00:03:11.710,00:03:13.340
"VICTOR COSTAN: Is, one.",00:03:13.340,00:03:15.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in once.,00:03:15.090,00:03:16.970
"VICTOR COSTAN: In, one.",00:03:16.970,00:03:18.200
AUDIENCE: Hat once.,00:03:18.200,00:03:18.991
VICTOR COSTAN: Awesome.,00:03:21.242,00:03:22.200
Thank you very much.,00:03:22.200,00:03:24.760
Second one.,00:03:24.760,00:03:25.910
Another volunteer.,00:03:25.910,00:03:27.500
"Yes, go for it.",00:03:27.500,00:03:28.270
"AUDIENCE: The, once.",00:03:28.270,00:03:30.231
"VICTOR COSTAN: The, one.",00:03:30.231,00:03:31.230
"AUDIENCE: Fox, once.",00:03:31.230,00:03:32.740
"VICTOR COSTAN: Fox, one",00:03:32.740,00:03:33.857
"AUDIENCE: Is, one.",00:03:33.857,00:03:35.020
"VICTOR COSTAN: Is, one.",00:03:35.020,00:03:36.708
"AUDIENCE: Outside, one.",00:03:36.708,00:03:38.604
"VICTOR COSTAN: Outside, one.",00:03:38.604,00:03:41.890
"OK, so this is a
document vector.",00:03:41.890,00:03:44.850
Notice two small details.,00:03:44.850,00:03:47.190
"Here, they is capitalized,
here it's not,",00:03:47.190,00:03:49.880
and yet I bundle them together.,00:03:49.880,00:03:52.570
"I know my grammar,
so I put periods",00:03:52.570,00:03:54.160
"at the end of the
sentences, and yet they",00:03:54.160,00:03:56.024
don't show up anywhere here.,00:03:56.024,00:03:57.190
"So we got rid of
the punctuation,",00:03:57.190,00:03:58.800
and we made all words lowercase.,00:03:58.800,00:04:00.185
"These are details,
but they are details",00:04:02.476,00:04:04.100
"that you'll see in
the code, so if you're",00:04:04.100,00:04:05.808
"wondering why, this is why.",00:04:05.808,00:04:07.850
"So step one, read the document,
make it a list of words.",00:04:07.850,00:04:11.180
"Step two, compute
the document vector.",00:04:11.180,00:04:13.250
"Step three, take the
two document vectors,",00:04:13.250,00:04:15.940
and compute the angle.,00:04:15.940,00:04:17.610
"What is the angle of
two document vectors?",00:04:17.610,00:04:20.560
Big ugly math formula.,00:04:20.560,00:04:21.980
"The only thing that's relevant
is that it takes these vectors",00:04:21.980,00:04:25.570
and computes an inner product.,00:04:25.570,00:04:27.860
"So if we look at the code for
angle vector, or vector angle,",00:04:27.860,00:04:33.580
"you'll see that because
numerator denominator lines two",00:04:33.580,00:04:37.400
"and three, it calls
inner product three times",00:04:37.400,00:04:40.450
"and then it does
some math with it.",00:04:40.450,00:04:42.562
We don't care about the math.,00:04:42.562,00:04:43.770
We assume the math is order one.,00:04:43.770,00:04:45.170
"We only care about
inner product.",00:04:45.170,00:04:48.514
How does inner product work?,00:04:48.514,00:04:49.680
"Can anyone help me compute the
inner product for these guys?",00:04:49.680,00:04:52.210
Yes?,00:04:56.960,00:04:57.920
"AUDIENCE: It's like
the dot product?",00:04:57.920,00:04:58.920
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.,00:04:58.920,00:04:59.672
"AUDIENCE: So, if we take the
vectors and you multiply them,",00:04:59.672,00:05:03.445
"like, you're adding to
the components, right?",00:05:03.445,00:05:05.870
Because they're so thick--,00:05:05.870,00:05:08.300
"VICTOR COSTAN: OK, this
is too complicated, then.",00:05:08.300,00:05:10.482
"I'm seriously
depressed, so give me",00:05:10.482,00:05:11.940
"some clear instructions
step by step.",00:05:11.940,00:05:15.600
"AUDIENCE: Like,
I know you divide",00:05:15.600,00:05:17.120
"by the length of
each of the vectors--",00:05:17.120,00:05:18.860
"VICTOR COSTAN: Let's
not worry about that.",00:05:18.860,00:05:20.280
"I have these vectors, and
I want an inner product.",00:05:20.280,00:05:22.420
"I don't care about the angle,
just the inner product.",00:05:22.420,00:05:25.454
"AUDIENCE: OK, well do 2
times 1 for the right.",00:05:25.454,00:05:27.750
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.,00:05:27.750,00:05:28.500
"So I take the here,
shows up twice.",00:05:28.500,00:05:30.620
"I take the here, shows up once.",00:05:30.620,00:05:32.690
"2 times 1, right?",00:05:32.690,00:05:33.970
AUDIENCE: Mhm.,00:05:33.970,00:05:34.640
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.,00:05:34.640,00:05:35.850
And then?,00:05:35.850,00:05:36.758
"AUDIENCE: I would
do the same for fox.",00:05:36.758,00:05:38.927
"VICTOR COSTAN: OK, fox shows up
here once, shows up here once,",00:05:38.927,00:05:41.510
so what I do?,00:05:41.510,00:05:43.739
AUDIENCE: 1 times 1.,00:05:43.739,00:05:45.070
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.,00:05:45.070,00:05:47.380
"AUDIENCE: And do
the same for is.",00:05:47.380,00:05:49.240
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.,00:05:49.240,00:05:50.816
AUDIENCE: And in should be 0.,00:05:50.816,00:05:53.400
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.,00:05:53.400,00:05:54.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in.,00:05:54.150,00:05:55.730
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.,00:05:55.730,00:05:56.480
"AUDIENCE: And then
outside would also be 0,",00:05:56.480,00:05:58.820
and hat would also be 0.,00:05:58.820,00:06:00.750
VICTOR COSTAN: OK.,00:06:00.750,00:06:01.580
"So it turns out you don't
have to go through both lists.",00:06:01.580,00:06:04.020
"It's sufficient to go
through one of the vectors",00:06:04.020,00:06:06.330
"and look up the words
in the other vector.",00:06:06.330,00:06:08.336
"Because if the words don't
show up in any of the vectors,",00:06:08.336,00:06:10.710
"their contribution
is going to be 0.",00:06:10.710,00:06:12.670
"So my algorithm is go
through each of the elements",00:06:12.670,00:06:16.670
"here, look up each of the words
there, look up at the word",00:06:16.670,00:06:20.010
here.,00:06:20.010,00:06:20.780
"And if there's a
word here and here,",00:06:20.780,00:06:23.500
"take out the number of times
it shows up in each document,",00:06:23.500,00:06:26.130
"multiply them, and
then add everything up.",00:06:26.130,00:06:31.470
So this is inner product.,00:06:31.470,00:06:33.440
"Everything else is good if
you're writing a search engine",00:06:33.440,00:06:35.890
"or if you're using the
scenario application,",00:06:35.890,00:06:38.020
"but we're not really
concerned with it.",00:06:38.020,00:06:40.880
"OK, so now we have
the three steps,",00:06:40.880,00:06:42.730
"read the document,
break it up into words,",00:06:42.730,00:06:45.630
"compute document vectors,
compute our inner product.",00:06:45.630,00:06:47.990
So this is what we want to do.,00:06:47.990,00:06:49.870
"And document distance 1 does
it in a painfully slow way,",00:06:49.870,00:06:53.650
"and we're probably not going to
cover everything in recitation.",00:06:53.650,00:06:57.010
"But if you go all the way
up to document distance 1,",00:06:57.010,00:06:59.460
"that's really, really fast.",00:06:59.460,00:07:00.610
"It's 1,000 times faster.",00:07:00.610,00:07:03.960
So this is our job for the day.,00:07:03.960,00:07:06.892
Let's look at the code.,00:07:06.892,00:07:07.850
"Did anyone look at
the code beforehand?",00:07:07.850,00:07:11.440
Nope.,00:07:11.440,00:07:12.400
"OK, so when I look at
a big piece of code,",00:07:12.400,00:07:15.130
"I like to look at
it from top down.",00:07:15.130,00:07:19.820
"So that means I start
to the main function,",00:07:19.820,00:07:22.080
"I see who is it calling,
I see what everything",00:07:22.080,00:07:24.370
"is trying to do, and then
I go into the sub functions",00:07:24.370,00:07:27.720
"and recurves and basically
do the same thing.",00:07:27.720,00:07:30.300
"So I build a tree of
who's calling what,",00:07:30.300,00:07:32.580
"and that helps me figure
out what's going on.",00:07:32.580,00:07:34.720
So let's start with main.,00:07:37.224,00:07:38.265
And let's look at main.,00:07:44.230,00:07:46.140
"Lines 1 through 6
look at the arguments.",00:07:46.140,00:07:49.150
We don't really care.,00:07:49.150,00:07:51.040
"Line 7 and 8 call word
frequencies for file.",00:07:51.040,00:07:54.365
I am abbreviating liberally.,00:08:01.520,00:08:04.770
"And then line 9
calls vector angle.",00:08:04.770,00:08:11.950
"So line 7 and 8 read
the two documents,",00:08:11.950,00:08:17.210
"do steps one and two, and
then 9 does step three.",00:08:17.210,00:08:20.490
OK.,00:08:31.010,00:08:31.700
Word frequencies for files.,00:08:31.700,00:08:33.220
"So the point of this
is to read a file",00:08:33.220,00:08:35.679
"and to produce a word
document vector out of it.",00:08:35.679,00:08:41.100
And it does it in three steps.,00:08:41.100,00:08:45.370
"Reads the file, line two.",00:08:45.370,00:08:48.840
"Breaks up the file into
words, so operation one,",00:08:48.840,00:08:52.300
"this is line 3, and then line
4, it takes up the list of words",00:08:52.300,00:08:56.170
"and computes a document
vector out of it.",00:08:56.170,00:08:58.790
"I don't care about
reading files because I'll",00:08:58.790,00:09:01.110
"assume this is
somehow done for me.",00:09:01.110,00:09:03.420
We care about the algorithms.,00:09:03.420,00:09:05.290
"So as far as I'm
concerned, this function",00:09:05.290,00:09:07.050
"is calling get words
from line list.",00:09:07.050,00:09:08.700
"Get words from line list,
and count frequency.",00:09:11.810,00:09:16.695
"And if we skip all the
way to vector angle--",00:09:26.100,00:09:29.130
"we already talked a little
bit about how all it does",00:09:29.130,00:09:32.440
"is it calls inner
product three times",00:09:32.440,00:09:34.580
"and then in does some
fancy math of it.",00:09:34.580,00:09:37.010
"So this is how the code

"tells me are the words
equal or not, right?",00:42:28.360,00:42:31.430

to be length of sum.",00:43:45.524,00:43:46.018

And then you add in the new one.,00:43:46.518,00:43:48.488
"So every time its going
to be increasing, correct?",00:43:48.488,00:43:50.572

"Yeah, so this time
they're not lists.",00:43:55.020,00:43:56.770
"So if you look at what's
going on inside there,",00:43:56.770,00:44:00.460
"you have count one
and count two are",00:44:00.460,00:44:03.840
"these numbers in the document
vector, so they're numbers.",00:44:03.840,00:44:08.780

out at 0, and then it",00:44:08.780,00:44:11.124
keeps getting numbers.,00:44:11.124,00:44:12.040
So sum is going to be a number.,00:44:12.040,00:44:14.050
"And multiplying numbers
is constant time,",00:44:14.050,00:44:16.240

"VICTOR COSTAN: Because
you're copying a number over.",00:44:24.545,00:44:26.711
"So as long as you're
copying one element over,",00:44:26.711,00:44:28.660
that's constant time.,00:44:28.660,00:44:29.535

this is 1, and then",00:44:52.880,00:44:55.860

"The second document is

dominate L1 and L2, right?",00:47:07.550,00:47:12.960

"So let's look at the vector
angle again, lines 2 and 3.",00:47:42.600,00:47:52.460
"So line 2, it calls inner
product with L1 and L2.",00:47:52.460,00:47:58.330
"But if you look at line
3, it calls inner product",00:47:58.330,00:48:00.670

"And as the length
of the document",00:51:02.814,00:51:04.287
"gets really, really big,
that [INAUDIBLE] constant?",00:51:04.287,00:51:08.215
"VICTOR COSTAN: Yeah, you
might be able to do that.",00:51:11.180,00:51:15.300
"Yes, I think for the cases
that we give you, that is true.",00:51:15.300,00:51:19.150
"Yeah, I never thought
of that, that's cool.",00:51:19.150,00:51:21.036
"AUDIENCE: It doesn't work if
it's not a language, right?",00:51:21.036,00:51:24.012
If you just have gibberish?,00:51:24.012,00:51:25.580
"VICTOR COSTAN: Yes, also, to
say that its constant is useful",00:51:25.580,00:51:32.760
"when the number of
words in English",00:51:32.760,00:51:35.050
"is much smaller than
your input size.",00:51:35.050,00:51:37.660
"So if, say, English
has 50,000 words",00:51:37.660,00:51:40.180
"and your input is 3,000 words,
then the input is much smaller.",00:51:40.180,00:51:43.850
"But if you're input is
a million words, which",00:51:43.850,00:51:45.910
"I think is what
we use, then yeah,",00:51:45.910,00:51:48.330
it comes down to constant.,00:51:48.330,00:51:49.709
"So yeah, that's a good insight.",00:51:49.709,00:51:51.000
That's really nice.,00:51:51.000,00:51:51.791
Anything else?,00:51:54.572,00:51:55.536
"OK, so you get to go through
document distance 3 to 8.",00:52:02.780,00:52:06.410
"We'll tell you what's
changed, and we'll",00:52:06.410,00:52:08.690
"give you a chance to
help you analyze it.",00:52:08.690,00:52:11.020
"But you have to analyze it,
then update the scorecard",00:52:11.020,00:52:13.850
"for each algorithm to
see how things improve.",00:52:13.850,00:52:19.000
Thanks.,00:52:19.000,00:52:20.067
