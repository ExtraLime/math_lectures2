Hey guys.,00:00:01.140,00:00:02.290
Welcome back.,00:00:02.290,00:00:03.570
"Today, we're going to be working
on a problem that asks",00:00:03.570,00:00:07.430
"you to find the PMF of a
function of a random variable.",00:00:07.430,00:00:12.860
So let's just jump right in.,00:00:12.860,00:00:16.410
"The problem statement gives
you the PMF for a random",00:00:16.410,00:00:21.060
variable called x.,00:00:21.060,00:00:23.180
"So we're told that there's this
random variable x that",00:00:23.180,00:00:26.340
"takes on values minus 3, minus
2, minus 1, 1, 2, and 3.",00:00:26.340,00:00:32.100
"And for each of those values,
the probability mass lying",00:00:32.100,00:00:35.440
"over that value is given
by this formula, x",00:00:35.440,00:00:39.030
squared over a.,00:00:39.030,00:00:41.010
"Now I didn't write it here to
save room, but we're also told",00:00:41.010,00:00:44.360
"that a is a real number that
is greater than 0.",00:00:44.360,00:00:47.980
"And we're told that the
probability of x taking on any",00:00:47.980,00:00:52.160
value outside of the set is 0.,00:00:52.160,00:00:56.430
"Now we're asked to do two
things in the problem.",00:00:56.430,00:00:58.930
"First is to find the value
of the parameter a.",00:00:58.930,00:01:03.040
"And that's sort of a natural
question to ask, because if",00:01:03.040,00:01:06.350
"you think about it, the PMF
isn't fully specified.",00:01:06.350,00:01:11.260
"And in fact, if you plug in the
wrong number for a, you",00:01:11.260,00:01:16.000
"actually won't get
a valid PMF.",00:01:16.000,00:01:18.800
"So we'll explore that idea
in the first part.",00:01:18.800,00:01:22.330
"And then the second part, you're
given a new random",00:01:22.330,00:01:24.600
variable called z.,00:01:24.600,00:01:25.905
"And z happens to be
a function of x.",00:01:25.905,00:01:28.550
"In fact, it's equal
to x squared.",00:01:28.550,00:01:30.990
"And then you're asked
to compute that PMF.",00:01:30.990,00:01:34.370
"So this problem is a good
practice problem.",00:01:34.370,00:01:38.810
"I think, at this point, you
guys are sort of newly",00:01:38.810,00:01:41.730
"acquainted with the
idea of a PMF, or",00:01:41.730,00:01:45.360
probability mass function.,00:01:45.360,00:01:47.340
"So this problem will hopefully
help you get more familiar",00:01:47.340,00:01:50.110
"with that concept and how
to manipulate PMFs.",00:01:50.110,00:01:55.570
"And by the way, just to make
sure we're all on the same",00:01:55.570,00:01:58.060
"page, what does a PMF
really tell you?",00:01:58.060,00:02:02.360
"So p sub X, where this is
a capital X, because the",00:02:02.360,00:02:08.389
"convention in this class
is to use capital",00:02:08.389,00:02:10.520
letters for random variables.,00:02:10.520,00:02:12.350
"So p X of k, this is defined
to be the probability that",00:02:12.350,00:02:17.700
"your random variable X takes
on a value of k.",00:02:17.700,00:02:22.740
"So essentially, this says--",00:02:22.740,00:02:25.630
and this is just some number.,00:02:25.630,00:02:27.750
"So in our particular case,
this would be equal to k",00:02:27.750,00:02:31.290
squared over a.,00:02:31.290,00:02:33.260
"And how you can interpret
this is this px guy is",00:02:33.260,00:02:38.470
sort of like a machine.,00:02:38.470,00:02:40.590
"He takes in some value that
your random variable could",00:02:40.590,00:02:45.950
"take on, and then he spits out
the amount of probability mass",00:02:45.950,00:02:50.340
lying over that value.,00:02:50.340,00:02:53.010
OK.,00:02:53.010,00:02:53.330
"So now that we've done that
quick recap, let's get back to",00:02:53.330,00:02:57.930
the first part of the problem.,00:02:57.930,00:02:59.530
"So we have this formula for
px of x, and we need",00:02:59.530,00:03:03.530
to solve for a.,00:03:03.530,00:03:04.930
"So in order to do that, we're
going to use one of our axioms",00:03:04.930,00:03:08.990
"of probability to set
up an equation.",00:03:08.990,00:03:11.160
"And then we can solve
precisely for a.",00:03:11.160,00:03:13.860
"So namely, we know that every
PMF must sum to 1.",00:03:13.860,00:03:20.120
"And so essentially, if you sum
this guy over all possible",00:03:20.120,00:03:24.000
"values of x, you should get a 1,
and that equation will let",00:03:24.000,00:03:27.410
us solve for a.,00:03:27.410,00:03:29.060
So let's do that.,00:03:29.060,00:03:30.910
Summation over x of px of x.,00:03:30.910,00:03:37.090
"So here, essentially
you're only summing",00:03:37.090,00:03:39.430
over these six values.,00:03:39.430,00:03:42.230
"So this is equal to px of minus
3, plus px of minus 2,",00:03:42.230,00:03:49.230
"plus px of minus 1, et cetera.",00:03:49.230,00:03:52.872
Oops. px of 2 plus px of 3.,00:03:52.872,00:03:58.270
OK.,00:03:58.270,00:03:58.760
"And again, like the
interpretation as we said,",00:03:58.760,00:04:01.510
"this number here should be
interpreted as the amount of",00:04:01.510,00:04:08.460
"probability mass lying
over minus 3.",00:04:08.460,00:04:13.810
"And to help you visualize this,
actually, before we go",00:04:13.810,00:04:16.790
"further with the computation,
let's actually plot this PMF.",00:04:16.790,00:04:21.870
"So the amount of probability
mass lying over minus 3, the",00:04:21.870,00:04:27.140
"way we figure that out is we
take minus 3 and we plug it",00:04:27.140,00:04:31.000
into this formula up here.,00:04:31.000,00:04:32.780
So you get 9/a.,00:04:32.780,00:04:34.030
 ,00:04:34.030,00:04:38.480
"Now you can do this
for minus 2.",00:04:38.480,00:04:40.750
"You've got 4/a, looking
at the formula.",00:04:40.750,00:04:43.740
"For 1, you get 1/a.",00:04:43.740,00:04:46.140
"And of course, this graph, it's
the mirror image over 0,",00:04:46.140,00:04:52.130
because of the symmetry.,00:04:52.130,00:04:55.370
"So hopefully this little
visualization helps you",00:04:55.370,00:05:00.600
"understand what I'm
talking about.",00:05:00.600,00:05:01.920
"And now we can just read
these values off of the",00:05:01.920,00:05:04.350
plot we just made.,00:05:04.350,00:05:06.470
"So we know px minus 3
is equal to px of 3.",00:05:06.470,00:05:10.310
"So we can go ahead and just
take 2 times 9/a.",00:05:10.310,00:05:15.330
"Similarly, we get 2 times 4/a,
and then plus 2 times 1/a.",00:05:15.330,00:05:22.700
"So now it's just a question
of algebra.",00:05:22.700,00:05:25.500
"So simplifying this, you're
going to get 18 plus 8 plus 2,",00:05:25.500,00:05:30.670
divided by a.,00:05:30.670,00:05:32.860
And this gives you 28/a.,00:05:32.860,00:05:35.750
"And as I argued before, you
know that if you sum a PMF",00:05:35.750,00:05:40.180
"over all possible values,
you must get 1.",00:05:40.180,00:05:43.120
"So this is equal to 1, which
of course implies that a is",00:05:43.120,00:05:46.910
equal to 28.,00:05:46.910,00:05:48.160
 ,00:05:48.160,00:05:50.330
"So what we've shown here is that
you actually don't have a",00:05:50.330,00:05:54.760
"choice for what value
a can take on.",00:05:54.760,00:05:59.360
It must take on 28.,00:05:59.360,00:06:01.790
"And in fact, if you plug in
any other value than 28 in",00:06:01.790,00:06:05.850
"here, you actually are not going
to have a valid PMF,",00:06:05.850,00:06:08.510
"because it's not going
to sum to 1.",00:06:08.510,00:06:11.810
OK.,00:06:11.810,00:06:12.250
"So I'm going to write my answer
here, and then erase to",00:06:12.250,00:06:16.960
give myself more room for part,00:06:16.960,00:06:20.580
