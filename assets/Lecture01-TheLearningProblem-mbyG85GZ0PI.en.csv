"ANNOUNCER: The following program
is brought to you by Caltech.",00:00:00.580,00:00:03.270
"YASER ABU-MOSTAFA: Welcome to machine
learning, and welcome to our online",00:00:16.250,00:00:19.950
audience as well.,00:00:19.950,00:00:21.650
"Let me start with an outline of the
course, and then go into the material",00:00:21.650,00:00:25.830
of today's lecture.,00:00:25.830,00:00:28.070
"As you see from the outline, the topics
are given colors, and that",00:00:28.070,00:00:34.540
"designates their main content, whether
it's mathematical or practical.",00:00:34.540,00:00:38.860
"Machine learning is
a very broad subject.",00:00:38.860,00:00:41.960
"It goes from very abstract theory to
extreme practice as in rules of thumb.",00:00:41.960,00:00:47.300
"And the inclusion of a topic in the
course depends on the relevance to",00:00:47.300,00:00:52.350
machine learning.,00:00:52.350,00:00:53.370
"So some mathematics is useful because it
gives you the conceptual framework,",00:00:53.370,00:00:57.720
"and then some practical aspects are
useful because they give you the way",00:00:57.720,00:01:02.320
to deal with real learning systems.,00:01:02.320,00:01:05.080
"Now if you look at the topics, these
are not meant to be separate topics",00:01:05.080,00:01:09.370
for each lecture.,00:01:09.370,00:01:10.560
"They just highlight the main
content of those lectures.",00:01:10.560,00:01:13.630
"But there is a story line that goes
through it, and let me tell you what",00:01:13.630,00:01:17.740
the story line is like.,00:01:17.740,00:01:20.380
It starts here with: what is learning?,00:01:20.380,00:01:23.530
Can we learn?,00:01:26.500,00:01:27.750
How to do it?,00:01:29.940,00:01:31.190
How to do it well?,00:01:33.660,00:01:37.250
And then the take-home lessons.,00:01:37.250,00:01:40.410
"There is a logical dependency that goes
through the course, and there's",00:01:40.410,00:01:44.420
"one exception to that
logical dependency.",00:01:44.420,00:01:48.390
"One lecture, which is the third one,
doesn't really belong here.",00:01:48.390,00:01:53.240
"It's a practical topic, and the reason
I included it early on is because I",00:01:53.240,00:01:57.750
"needed to give you some tools to play
around with, to test the",00:01:57.750,00:02:01.740
theoretical and conceptual aspects.,00:02:01.740,00:02:03.990
"If I waited until it belonged normally,
which is to the second aspect of the",00:02:03.990,00:02:09.430
"linear models which is down there, the
beginning of the course would be",00:02:09.430,00:02:15.620
"just too theoretical
for people's taste.",00:02:15.620,00:02:18.730
"And as you see, if you look at the
colors, it is mostly red in the",00:02:18.730,00:02:22.320
beginning and mostly blue in the end.,00:02:22.320,00:02:25.080
"So it starts building the
concepts and the theory.",00:02:25.080,00:02:28.430
"And then it goes on to the
practical aspects.",00:02:28.430,00:02:32.100
"Now, let me start today's lecture.",00:02:32.100,00:02:35.970
"And the subject of the lecture
is the learning problem.",00:02:35.970,00:02:39.790
"It's an introduction to
what learning is.",00:02:39.790,00:02:41.890
"And I will draw your attention
to one aspect of this slide,",00:02:41.890,00:02:45.230
which is this part.,00:02:45.230,00:02:48.450
That's the logo of the course.,00:02:48.450,00:02:50.590
"And believe it or not,
this is not artwork.",00:02:50.590,00:02:53.850
"This is actually a technical
figure that will come up",00:02:53.850,00:02:56.720
in one of the lectures.,00:02:56.720,00:02:57.670
I'm not going to tell you which one.,00:02:57.670,00:02:59.200
"So you can wait in anticipation until it
comes up, but this will actually be",00:02:59.200,00:03:03.100
"a scientific figure that
we will talk about.",00:03:03.100,00:03:06.420
"Now when we move to today's
lecture, I'm going to talk",00:03:06.420,00:03:11.930
today about the following.,00:03:11.930,00:03:14.660
"Machine learning is a very broad
subject, and I'm going to start with",00:03:14.660,00:03:18.590
"one example that captures the
essence of machine learning.",00:03:18.590,00:03:22.100
"It's a fun example about movies
that everybody watches.",00:03:22.100,00:03:26.480
"And then after that, I'm going to
abstract from the learning problem,",00:03:26.480,00:03:30.870
"the practical learning problem,
aspects that are common to all",00:03:30.870,00:03:35.690
"learning situations that
you're going to face.",00:03:35.690,00:03:38.540
"And in abstracting them, we'll have the
mathematical formalization of the",00:03:38.540,00:03:42.030
learning problem.,00:03:42.030,00:03:43.310
"And then we will get our first algorithm
for machine learning today.",00:03:43.310,00:03:47.530
"It's a very simple algorithm, but it
will fix the idea about what is the",00:03:47.530,00:03:51.210
role of an algorithm in this case.,00:03:51.210,00:03:53.060
"And we will survey the types of learning,
so that we know which part we",00:03:53.060,00:03:56.420
"are emphasizing in this course,
and which parts are nearby.",00:03:56.420,00:04:01.400
"And I will end up with a puzzle, a very
interesting puzzle, and it's",00:04:01.400,00:04:04.775
"a puzzle in more ways than
one, as you will see.",00:04:04.775,00:04:08.390
"OK, so let me start with an example.",00:04:08.390,00:04:11.040
"The example of machine learning that
I'm going to start with is how",00:04:14.040,00:04:18.410
a viewer would rate a movie.,00:04:18.410,00:04:22.290
"Now that is an interesting problem, and
it's interesting for us because we",00:04:22.290,00:04:26.195
"watch movies, and very interesting for
a company that rents out movies.",00:04:26.195,00:04:30.020
"And indeed, a company which is Netflix
wanted to improve the in-house system",00:04:30.020,00:04:37.070
by a mere 10%.,00:04:37.070,00:04:40.040
"So they make recommendations when you
log in, they recommend movies that",00:04:40.040,00:04:43.450
"they think you will like, so they think
that you'll rate them highly.",00:04:43.450,00:04:46.650
"And they had a system, and they
wanted to improve the system.",00:04:46.650,00:04:50.230
"So how much is a 10% improvement in
performance worth to the company?",00:04:50.230,00:04:56.610
"It was actually $1 million that was
paid out to the first group that",00:04:56.610,00:05:03.480
"actually managed to get
the 10% improvement.",00:05:03.480,00:05:06.780
"So you ask yourself, 10% improvement
in something like that, why should",00:05:06.780,00:05:10.780
that be worth a million dollars?,00:05:10.780,00:05:13.670
"It's because, if the recommendations
that the movie company makes are spot",00:05:13.670,00:05:19.890
"on, you will pay more attention to the
recommendation, you are likely to rent",00:05:19.890,00:05:25.150
"the movies that they recommend, and they
will make lots of money-- much",00:05:25.150,00:05:27.830
"more than the million dollars
they promised.",00:05:27.830,00:05:30.130
"And this is very typical
in machine learning.",00:05:30.130,00:05:31.910
"For example, machine learning has
applications in financial forecasting.",00:05:31.910,00:05:35.290
"You can imagine that the minutest
improvement in financial forecasting",00:05:35.290,00:05:38.970
can make a lot of money.,00:05:38.970,00:05:40.810
"So the fact that you can actually push
the system to be better using machine",00:05:40.810,00:05:45.410
"learning is a very attractive aspect of
the technique in a wide spectrum of",00:05:45.410,00:05:50.800
applications.,00:05:50.800,00:05:52.480
So what did these guys do?,00:05:52.480,00:05:53.985
"They gave the data, and people started
working on the problem using different",00:05:57.320,00:06:04.260
"algorithms, until someone managed
to get the prize.",00:06:04.260,00:06:08.810
"Now if you look at the problem of
rating a movie, it captures the",00:06:08.810,00:06:12.530
"essence of machine learning, and the
essence has three components.",00:06:12.530,00:06:16.460
"If you find these three components in
a problem you have in your field, then",00:06:16.460,00:06:20.320
"you know that machine learning is
ready as an application tool.",00:06:20.320,00:06:24.300
What are the three?,00:06:24.300,00:06:25.850
"The first one is that
a pattern exists.",00:06:25.850,00:06:29.860
"If a pattern didn't exist, there
would be nothing to look for.",00:06:29.860,00:06:33.810
So what is the pattern here?,00:06:33.810,00:06:35.900
"There is no question that the way
a person rates a movie is related to how",00:06:35.900,00:06:41.990
"they rated other movies, and is
also related to how other",00:06:41.990,00:06:46.200
people rated that movie.,00:06:46.200,00:06:48.870
We know that much.,00:06:48.870,00:06:50.250
"So there is a pattern
to be discovered.",00:06:50.250,00:06:52.670
"However, we cannot really pin
it down mathematically.",00:06:52.670,00:06:57.710
"I cannot ask you to write a 17th-order
polynomial that captures how people",00:06:57.710,00:07:01.740
rate movies.,00:07:01.740,00:07:03.790
"So the fact that there is a pattern,
and that we cannot pin it down",00:07:03.790,00:07:06.880
"mathematically, is the reason why we
are going for machine learning.",00:07:06.880,00:07:10.800
"For ""learning from data"".",00:07:10.800,00:07:12.520
"We couldn't write down the system on our
own, so we're going to depend on",00:07:12.520,00:07:15.930
"data in order to be able
to find the system.",00:07:15.930,00:07:18.930
"There is a missing component
which is very important.",00:07:18.930,00:07:21.080
"If you don't have that,
you are out of luck.",00:07:21.080,00:07:24.970
"We have to have data. We
are learning from data.",00:07:24.970,00:07:28.310
"So if someone knocks on my door with
an interesting machine learning",00:07:28.310,00:07:31.030
"application, and they tell me how
exciting it is, and how great the",00:07:31.030,00:07:33.670
"application would be, and how much
money they would make, the first",00:07:33.670,00:07:37.200
"question I ask, what data do you have?",00:07:37.200,00:07:41.150
"If you data, we are in business.",00:07:41.150,00:07:43.120
"If you don't, you are out of luck.",00:07:43.120,00:07:45.880
"If you have these three components,
you are ready to",00:07:45.880,00:07:48.510
apply machine learning.,00:07:48.510,00:07:50.970
"Now let me give you a solution to the
movie rating, in order to start",00:07:51.750,00:07:56.030
getting a feel for it.,00:07:56.030,00:07:57.220
So here is a system.,00:07:57.220,00:07:59.160
Let me start to focus on part of it.,00:07:59.160,00:08:01.630
"We are going to describe a viewer
as a vector of factors, a profile if",00:08:01.630,00:08:07.230
you will.,00:08:07.230,00:08:08.630
"So if you look here for example, the
first one would be comedy content.",00:08:08.630,00:08:16.320
Does the movie have a lot of comedy?,00:08:17.360,00:08:18.660
"From a viewer point of view,
do they like comedies?",00:08:21.600,00:08:25.020
"Here, do they like action?",00:08:25.020,00:08:27.800
"Do they prefer blockbusters, or
do they like fringe movies?",00:08:27.800,00:08:31.580
"And you can go on all the way, even to
asking yourself whether you like the",00:08:31.580,00:08:36.210
lead actor or not.,00:08:36.210,00:08:38.250
"Now you go to the content of the
movie itself, and you get the",00:08:38.250,00:08:42.909
corresponding part.,00:08:42.909,00:08:44.580
Does the movie have comedy?,00:08:44.580,00:08:46.750
Does it have action?,00:08:46.750,00:08:48.010
Is it a blockbuster?,00:08:48.010,00:08:49.160
And so on.,00:08:49.160,00:08:50.620
"Now you compare the two, and you realize
that if there is a match--",00:08:50.620,00:08:56.310
"let's say you hate comedy and the
movie has a lot of comedy--",00:08:56.310,00:08:59.950
"then the chances are you're
not going to like it.",00:08:59.950,00:09:02.090
"But if there is a match between so many
coordinates, and the",00:09:02.770,00:09:06.670
"number of factors here could be
really like 300 factors.",00:09:06.670,00:09:10.730
"Then the chances are you'll
like the movie.",00:09:10.730,00:09:12.590
"And if there's a mismatch, the
chances are you're not",00:09:12.590,00:09:15.220
going to like the movie.,00:09:15.220,00:09:16.570
"So what do you do,",00:09:16.570,00:09:17.670
"you match the movie and the viewer
factors, and then you add the",00:09:17.680,00:09:21.900
contributions of them.,00:09:21.900,00:09:23.240
"And then as a result of that, you
get the predicted rating.",00:09:23.240,00:09:26.950
"This is all good except for one problem,
which is this is really not",00:09:28.370,00:09:34.100
machine learning.,00:09:34.100,00:09:35.950
"In order to produce this thing, you have
to watch the movie, and analyze",00:09:35.950,00:09:40.190
the content.,00:09:40.190,00:09:41.300
"You have to interview the viewer,
and ask about their taste.",00:09:41.300,00:09:46.180
"And then after that, you combine
them and try to get",00:09:46.180,00:09:49.020
a prediction for the rating.,00:09:49.020,00:09:51.000
"Now the idea of machine learning is that
you don't have to do any of that.",00:09:52.130,00:09:55.590
"All you do is sit down and sip on your
tea, while the machine is doing",00:09:55.590,00:09:59.550
"something to come up with
this figure on its own.",00:09:59.550,00:10:03.050
"So let's look at the
learning approach.",00:10:03.570,00:10:06.460
"So in the learning approach, we know
that the viewer will be a vector of",00:10:06.460,00:10:12.390
"different factors, and different
components for every factor.",00:10:12.390,00:10:16.150
"So this vector will be different
from one viewer to another.",00:10:16.150,00:10:20.680
"For example, one viewer will have a big
blue content here, and one of them",00:10:21.050,00:10:25.500
"will have a small blue content,
depending on their taste.",00:10:25.500,00:10:28.510
"And then, there is the movie.",00:10:28.940,00:10:32.140
"And a particular movie will have different
contents that correspond to those.",00:10:32.140,00:10:37.220
"And the way we said we are computing the
rating, is by simply taking these",00:10:37.220,00:10:42.580
"and combining them and
getting the rating.",00:10:42.580,00:10:45.830
"Now what machine learning will do is
reverse-engineer that process.",00:10:45.830,00:10:51.830
"It starts from the rating, and then
tries to find out what factors would be",00:10:54.310,00:10:59.380
consistent with that rating.,00:10:59.380,00:11:01.800
So think of it this way.,00:11:01.800,00:11:03.120
"You start, let's say, with
completely random factors.",00:11:03.120,00:11:07.690
"So you take these guys, just random
numbers from beginning to end, and",00:11:07.690,00:11:12.260
"these guys, random numbers
from beginning to end.",00:11:12.260,00:11:14.290
"For every user and every movie,
that's your starting point.",00:11:14.290,00:11:17.620
"Obviously, there is no chance in the
world that when you get the inner",00:11:17.620,00:11:22.810
"product between these factors that are
random, that you'll get anything that",00:11:22.810,00:11:26.120
"looks like the rating that actually
took place, right?",00:11:26.120,00:11:30.120
"But what you do is you take a rating
that actually happened, and then you",00:11:30.120,00:11:34.430
"start nudging the factors ever so
slightly toward that rating.",00:11:34.430,00:11:40.010
"Make the direction of the inner product
get closer to the rating.",00:11:40.010,00:11:45.540
"Now it looks like a hopeless thing. I
start with so many factors, they are",00:11:45.540,00:11:49.500
"all random, and I'm trying to
make them match a rating.",00:11:49.500,00:11:51.780
What are the chances?,00:11:51.780,00:11:53.330
"Well the point is that you are going to
do this not for one rating, but for",00:11:53.330,00:11:57.070
a 100 million ratings.,00:11:57.070,00:11:59.050
"And you keep cycling through
the 100 million, over",00:11:59.050,00:12:01.610
and over and over.,00:12:01.610,00:12:03.740
"And eventually, lo and behold, you
find that the factors now are",00:12:03.740,00:12:08.180
meaningful in terms of the ratings.,00:12:08.180,00:12:10.420
"And if you get a user, a viewer here,
that didn't watch a movie, and you get",00:12:10.420,00:12:17.380
"the vector that resulted from that
learning process, and you get the",00:12:17.380,00:12:21.320
"movie vector that resulted from that
process, and you do the inner product,",00:12:21.320,00:12:25.470
"lo and behold, you get a rating which
is actually consistent with how that",00:12:25.470,00:12:29.640
viewer rates the movie.,00:12:29.640,00:12:31.770
That's the idea.,00:12:31.770,00:12:33.480
"Now this actually, the solution I
described, is one of the winning",00:12:35.380,00:12:41.050
"solutions in the competition
that I mentioned.",00:12:41.050,00:12:43.220
"So this is for real, this
actually can be used.",00:12:43.220,00:12:47.170
"Now with this example in mind,
let's actually go to the",00:12:47.170,00:12:51.440
components of learning.,00:12:51.440,00:12:52.610
"So now I would like to abstract from the
learning problems that I see, what",00:12:52.610,00:12:56.700
"are the mathematical components that
make up the learning problem?",00:12:56.700,00:13:00.280
And I'm going to use a metaphor.,00:13:00.280,00:13:01.910
"I'm going to use a metaphor now from
another application domain, which",00:13:01.910,00:13:05.540
is a financial application.,00:13:05.540,00:13:07.280
"So the metaphor we are going to
use is credit approval.",00:13:07.280,00:13:11.900
"You apply for a credit card, and the
bank wants to decide whether it's",00:13:11.900,00:13:15.600
"a good idea to extend a credit
card for you or not.",00:13:15.600,00:13:18.010
"From the bank's point of view,
if they're going to make",00:13:18.010,00:13:19.960
"money, they are happy.",00:13:19.960,00:13:20.800
"If they are going to lose money,
they are not happy.",00:13:20.800,00:13:22.490
That's the only criterion they have.,00:13:22.490,00:13:24.590
"Now, very much like we didn't have
a magic formula for deciding how",00:13:24.590,00:13:29.000
"a viewer will rate a movie, the bank
doesn't have a magic formula for",00:13:29.000,00:13:32.660
"deciding whether a person
is creditworthy or not.",00:13:32.660,00:13:36.230
"What they're going to do, they're going
to rely on historical records of",00:13:36.230,00:13:39.940
"previous customers, and how their credit
behavior turned out, and then",00:13:39.940,00:13:43.950
"try to reverse-engineer the system, and
when they get the system frozen,",00:13:43.950,00:13:47.660
"they're going to apply it
to a future customer.",00:13:47.660,00:13:50.070
That's the deal.,00:13:50.070,00:13:51.480
What are the components here?,00:13:51.480,00:13:54.360
Let's look at it.,00:13:54.360,00:13:56.480
"First, you have the applicant
information.",00:13:56.480,00:13:58.690
"And the applicant information-- you
look at this, and you can see that",00:13:58.690,00:14:02.380
"there is the age, the gender, how much
money you make, how much money you",00:14:02.380,00:14:06.865
"owe, and all kinds of fields that are
believed to be related to the",00:14:06.865,00:14:10.870
creditworthiness.,00:14:10.870,00:14:13.160
"Again, pretty much like we did in
the movie example, there is no question",00:14:13.160,00:14:17.580
"that these fields are related
to the creditworthiness.",00:14:17.580,00:14:21.310
"They don't necessarily uniquely
determine it, but they are related.",00:14:21.310,00:14:25.020
"And the bank doesn't want a sure bet.
They want to get the credit decision",00:14:25.020,00:14:28.680
as reliable as possible.,00:14:28.680,00:14:29.950
"So they want to use that pattern,
in order to be able to come up with",00:14:29.950,00:14:32.970
a good decision.,00:14:32.970,00:14:33.960
"And they take this input, and they want
to approve the credit or deny it.",00:14:34.620,00:14:38.900
So let's formalize this.,00:14:38.900,00:14:41.220
"First, we are going to
have an input.",00:14:41.220,00:14:45.190
"And the input is called
x. Surprise, surprise!",00:14:45.190,00:14:48.640
"And that input happens to be
the customer application.",00:14:48.640,00:14:52.970
"So we can think of it as
a d-dimensional vector, the first",00:14:52.970,00:14:56.280
"component is the salary, years in
residence, outstanding debt, whatever",00:14:56.280,00:15:00.660
the components are.,00:15:00.660,00:15:01.600
"You put it as a vector, and
that becomes the input.",00:15:01.600,00:15:05.170
"Then we get the output y. The output
y is simply the decision, either to",00:15:05.170,00:15:09.690
"extend credit or not to extend
credit, +1 and -1.",00:15:09.690,00:15:14.130
"And being a good or bad customer, that
is from the bank's point of view.",00:15:17.540,00:15:22.980
"Now we have after that,
the target function.",00:15:22.980,00:15:26.380
"The target function is a function
from a domain X, which is the",00:15:26.380,00:15:31.860
set of all of these x's.,00:15:31.860,00:15:34.370
"So it is the set of vectors
of d dimensions.",00:15:34.770,00:15:37.240
"So it's a d-dimensional Euclidean
space, in this case.",00:15:37.240,00:15:40.020
And then the Y is the set of y's.,00:15:40.020,00:15:42.220
"Well, that's an easy one because
y can only be +1 or -1,",00:15:42.220,00:15:44.820
accept or deny.,00:15:44.820,00:15:46.320
"And therefore this is just
a binary co-domain.",00:15:46.320,00:15:49.990
"And this target function is the ideal
credit approval formula, which we",00:15:49.990,00:15:55.620
don't know.,00:15:55.620,00:15:57.280
"In all of our endeavors in machine
learning, the target function is",00:15:57.280,00:16:00.920
unknown to us.,00:16:00.920,00:16:02.740
"If it were known, nobody
needs learning.",00:16:02.740,00:16:05.850
We just go ahead and implement it.,00:16:05.850,00:16:08.120
"But we need to learn it because
it is unknown to us.",00:16:08.120,00:16:11.890
"So what are we going
to do to learn it?",00:16:11.890,00:16:14.850
"We are going to use data, examples.",00:16:14.850,00:16:19.040
"So the data in this case is based on
previous customer application records.",00:16:19.040,00:16:23.360
"The input, which is the information in
their applications, and the output,",00:16:23.360,00:16:28.040
"which is how they turned
out in hindsight.",00:16:28.040,00:16:31.070
"This is not a question of prediction
at the time they applied, but after",00:16:31.070,00:16:33.920
"five years, they turned out
to be a great customer.",00:16:33.920,00:16:36.430
"So the bank says, if someone has
these attributes again, let's approve",00:16:36.430,00:16:40.005
"credit because these guys
tend to make us money.",00:16:40.005,00:16:43.150
"And this one made us lose a lot of
money, so let's deny it, and so on.",00:16:43.150,00:16:47.290
"And the historical records-- there are
plenty of historical records.",00:16:47.290,00:16:50.680
"All of this makes sense when you're
talking about having 100,000 of",00:16:50.680,00:16:54.180
those guys.,00:16:54.180,00:16:55.030
"Then you pretty much say, I will
capture what the essence of that",00:16:55.030,00:16:58.160
function is.,00:16:58.160,00:16:59.330
"So this is the data, and then you use
the data, which is the historical",00:16:59.330,00:17:02.940
"records, in order to
get the hypothesis.",00:17:02.940,00:17:06.829
"The hypothesis is the formal name we're
going to call the formula we get",00:17:06.829,00:17:12.160
to approximate the target function.,00:17:12.160,00:17:14.220
"So the hypothesis lives in the same
world as the target function, and if",00:17:14.220,00:17:19.349
"you look at the value of g, it supposedly
approximates f.",00:17:19.349,00:17:25.780
"While f is unknown to us,
g is very much known--",00:17:25.780,00:17:29.030
"actually we created it-- and the hope
is that it does approximate f well.",00:17:29.030,00:17:33.050
That's the goal of learning.,00:17:33.050,00:17:35.690
"So this notation will be our notation
for the rest of the course, so get",00:17:35.690,00:17:39.310
used to it.,00:17:39.310,00:17:40.170
"The target function is always f, the
hypothesis we produce, which we'll",00:17:40.170,00:17:43.800
"refer to as the final hypothesis will be
called g, the data will always have",00:17:43.800,00:17:47.860
"that notation-- there are capital N
points, which are the data set.",00:17:47.860,00:17:51.400
And the output is always y.,00:17:51.400,00:17:55.630
So this is the formula to be used.,00:17:55.630,00:17:59.120
"Now, let's put it in a diagram in order
to analyze it a little bit more.",00:17:59.120,00:18:03.940
"If you look at the diagram
here, here is the target",00:18:03.940,00:18:07.110
function and it is unknown--,00:18:07.110,00:18:08.810
"that is the ideal approval which we will
never know, but that's what we're",00:18:08.810,00:18:11.740
hoping to get to approximate.,00:18:11.740,00:18:13.860
And we don't see it.,00:18:13.860,00:18:15.170
"We see it only through the eyes
of the training examples.",00:18:15.170,00:18:18.230
"This is our vehicle of understanding
what the target function is.",00:18:18.230,00:18:21.350
"Otherwise the target function is
a mysterious quantity for us.",00:18:21.350,00:18:25.170
"And eventually, we would like to
produce the final hypothesis.",00:18:25.170,00:18:28.440
"The final hypothesis is the formula the
bank is going to use in order to",00:18:28.440,00:18:31.490
"approve or deny credit, with the hope
that g hopefully approximates that f.",00:18:31.490,00:18:36.440
Now what connects those two guys?,00:18:37.300,00:18:41.160
This will be the learning algorithm.,00:18:41.160,00:18:43.110
"So the learning algorithm takes the
examples, and will produce the final",00:18:43.110,00:18:47.340
"hypothesis, as we described in the
example of the movie rating.",00:18:47.340,00:18:51.850
"Now there is another component that
goes into the learning algorithm.",00:18:51.850,00:18:56.880
"So what the learning algorithm does, it
creates the formula from a preset",00:18:56.880,00:19:02.430
"model of formulas, a set of candidate
formulas, if you will.",00:19:02.430,00:19:06.100
"And these we are going to call the
hypothesis set, a set of hypotheses",00:19:06.100,00:19:10.610
"from which we are going to
pick one hypothesis.",00:19:10.610,00:19:13.230
"So from this H comes a bunch of small
h's, which are functions that can be",00:19:13.230,00:19:18.440
"candidates for being the
credit approval.",00:19:18.440,00:19:21.320
"And one of them will be picked by the
learning algorithm, which happens to",00:19:21.320,00:19:24.390
"be g, hopefully approximating f.",00:19:24.390,00:19:27.220
"Now if you look at this part of the
chain, from the target function to the",00:19:27.220,00:19:30.960
"training to the learning algorithm to
the final hypothesis, this is very",00:19:30.960,00:19:34.540
"natural, and nobody will
object to that.",00:19:34.540,00:19:37.280
"But why do we have this
hypothesis set?",00:19:37.280,00:19:40.280
"Why not let the algorithm
pick from anything?",00:19:40.280,00:19:44.030
"Just create the formula, without being
restricted to a particular set of",00:19:44.030,00:19:48.150
formulas H.,00:19:48.150,00:19:50.190
"There are two reasons, and
I want to explain them.",00:19:50.190,00:19:52.790
"One of them is that there is no downside
for including a hypothesis",00:19:52.790,00:19:56.920
set in the formalization.,00:19:56.920,00:19:59.320
And there is an upside.,00:19:59.320,00:20:01.480
"So let me describe why there is no
downside, and then describe why there",00:20:01.480,00:20:05.030
is an upside.,00:20:05.030,00:20:07.040
"There is no downside for the simple
reason that, from a practical point of",00:20:07.040,00:20:11.430
"view, that's what you do.",00:20:11.430,00:20:12.730
"You want to learn, you say I'm going
to use a linear formula.",00:20:12.730,00:20:14.770
I'm going to use a neural network.,00:20:14.770,00:20:16.060
"I'm going to use a support
vector machine.",00:20:16.060,00:20:17.570
"So you are already dictating
a set of hypotheses.",00:20:17.570,00:20:20.990
"If you happen to be a brave soul, and you
don't want to restrict yourself at",00:20:20.990,00:20:25.260
"all, very well, then your hypothesis
set is the set of all possible",00:20:25.260,00:20:29.680
hypotheses.,00:20:29.680,00:20:31.580
Right?,00:20:31.580,00:20:32.200
"So there is no loss of generality
in putting it.",00:20:32.200,00:20:34.600
So there is no downside.,00:20:34.600,00:20:37.410
"The upside is not obvious here, but it
will become obvious as we go through",00:20:37.410,00:20:40.890
the theory.,00:20:40.890,00:20:41.900
"The hypothesis set will play a pivotal
role in the theory of learning.",00:20:41.900,00:20:47.150
"It will tell us: can we learn, and
how well we learn, and whatnot.",00:20:47.150,00:20:50.590
"Therefore having it as an explicit
component in the problem statement",00:20:50.590,00:20:54.370
will make the theory go through.,00:20:54.370,00:20:56.600
So that's why we have this figure.,00:20:56.600,00:20:58.910
"Now, let me focus on the solution
components of that figure.",00:20:59.720,00:21:04.440
"What do I mean by the
solution components?",00:21:04.440,00:21:07.520
"If you look at this, the first part,
which is the target-- let me try to",00:21:07.520,00:21:14.610
expand it--,00:21:14.610,00:21:15.570
"so the target function is
not under your control.",00:21:15.570,00:21:18.540
"Someone knocks on my door and says:
I want to approve credit.",00:21:18.540,00:21:21.640
"That's the target function, I
have no control over that.",00:21:21.640,00:21:24.730
"And by the way, here are
the historical records.",00:21:24.730,00:21:27.110
"I have no control over that,
so they give me the data.",00:21:27.110,00:21:30.440
"And would you please hand me
the final hypothesis?",00:21:30.440,00:21:33.330
"That is what I'm going to give them at
the end, before I receive my check.",00:21:33.330,00:21:36.250
So all of that is completely dictated.,00:21:36.900,00:21:39.170
"Now let's look at the other part. The
learning algorithm, and the hypothesis",00:21:39.170,00:21:49.120
"set that we talked about,
are your solution tools.",00:21:49.120,00:21:52.090
"These are things you choose, in
order to solve the problem.",00:21:52.090,00:21:55.450
"And I would like to take a little bit
of a look into what they look like,",00:21:55.450,00:22:01.150
"and give you an example of them, so that
you have a complete chain for",00:22:01.150,00:22:04.770
the entire figure in your mind.,00:22:04.770,00:22:06.630
"From the target function, to the data
set, to the learning algorithm,",00:22:06.630,00:22:09.670
"hypothesis set, and the
final hypothesis.",00:22:09.670,00:22:12.210
"So, here is the hypothesis set.",00:22:12.780,00:22:15.520
"We chose the notation H for the
set, and the element will be given the",00:22:15.520,00:22:22.820
symbol small h.,00:22:22.820,00:22:23.990
"So h is a function, pretty much
like the final hypothesis g.",00:22:23.990,00:22:27.890
"g is just one of them
that you happen to elect.",00:22:27.890,00:22:30.540
"So when we elect it, we call it g. If
it's sitting there generically, we",00:22:30.540,00:22:34.060
call it h.,00:22:34.060,00:22:35.100
"And then, when you put them together,
they are referred to as",00:22:35.860,00:22:39.090
the learning model.,00:22:39.090,00:22:39.690
"So if you're asked what is the learning
model you are using, you're",00:22:39.690,00:22:42.610
"actually choosing both a hypothesis
set and a learning algorithm.",00:22:42.610,00:22:46.580
"We'll see the perceptron in a moment,
so this would be the",00:22:46.580,00:22:49.400
"perceptron model, and this would be the
perceptron learning algorithm.",00:22:49.400,00:22:52.780
"This could be neural network, and
this would be back propagation.",00:22:52.780,00:22:56.420
"This could be support vector
machines of some kind, let's say",00:22:56.420,00:22:59.050
"radial basis function version, and this
would be the quadratic programming.",00:22:59.050,00:23:02.520
"So every time you have a model, there is
a hypothesis set, and then there is",00:23:02.520,00:23:05.840
"an algorithm that will do the
searching and produce",00:23:05.840,00:23:07.960
one of those guys.,00:23:07.960,00:23:09.280
So this is the standard form,00:23:09.690,00:23:13.630
for the solution.,00:23:13.630,00:23:14.820
"Now, let me go through a simple
hypothesis set in detail so we have",00:23:14.820,00:23:18.860
something to implement.,00:23:18.860,00:23:19.650
"So after the lecture, you can actually
implement a learning algorithm on real",00:23:19.650,00:23:23.860
data if you want to.,00:23:23.860,00:23:24.950
"This is not a glorious model. It's
a very simple model. On the other hand,",00:23:24.950,00:23:28.440
"it's a very clear model to pinpoint
what we are talking about.",00:23:28.440,00:23:33.790
So here is the deal.,00:23:34.570,00:23:35.890
"You have an input, and the input
is x_1 up to x_d, as we said--",00:23:39.660,00:23:43.730
"d-dimensional vector-- and each of them
comes from the real numbers, just",00:23:43.730,00:23:49.210
for simplicity.,00:23:49.210,00:23:49.840
So this belongs to the real numbers.,00:23:49.840,00:23:51.320
"And these are the attributes
of a customer.",00:23:51.320,00:23:53.170
"As we said, salary, years in
residence, and whatnot.",00:23:53.170,00:23:56.470
So what does the perceptron model do?,00:23:56.470,00:24:00.080
It does a very simple formula.,00:24:00.080,00:24:02.730
"It takes the attributes you have and
gives them different weights, w.",00:24:02.730,00:24:08.760
"So let's say the salary is important,
the chances are w corresponding to the",00:24:08.760,00:24:12.110
salary will be big.,00:24:12.110,00:24:13.900
"Some other attribute is
not that important.",00:24:13.900,00:24:15.880
"The chances are the w that
goes with it is not that big.",00:24:15.880,00:24:19.210
"Actually, outstanding
debt is bad news.",00:24:19.210,00:24:21.540
"If you owe a lot, that's not good.",00:24:21.540,00:24:23.370
"So the chances are the weight will
be negative for outstanding",00:24:23.370,00:24:26.600
"debt, and so on.",00:24:26.600,00:24:28.420
"Now you add them together, and you add
them in a linear form-- that's what",00:24:28.420,00:24:32.210
makes it a perceptron--,00:24:32.210,00:24:33.630
"and you can look at this as
a credit score, of sorts.",00:24:33.630,00:24:39.010
"Now you compare the credit
score with a threshold.",00:24:39.760,00:24:43.300
"If you exceed the threshold, they
approve the credit card.",00:24:43.300,00:24:46.690
"And if you don't, they
deny the credit card.",00:24:46.690,00:24:50.420
So that is the formula they,00:24:50.420,00:24:51.710
settle on.,00:24:51.710,00:24:52.520
"They have no idea, yet, what the w's and
the threshold are, but they dictated the",00:24:52.520,00:24:58.500
"formula-- the analytic form that
they're going to use.",00:24:58.500,00:25:01.110
"Now we take this and we put it
in the formalization we had.",00:25:02.040,00:25:06.530
"We have to define a hypothesis h,
and this will tell us what is the",00:25:06.530,00:25:11.370
"hypothesis set that has all the
hypotheses that have the same",00:25:11.370,00:25:14.820
functional form.,00:25:14.820,00:25:16.170
So you can write it down as this.,00:25:16.170,00:25:17.530
"This is a little bit long, but there's
absolutely nothing to it.",00:25:17.530,00:25:22.270
"This is your credit score, and this
is the threshold you compare to by",00:25:22.270,00:25:26.490
subtracting.,00:25:26.490,00:25:27.740
"If this quantity is positive, you belong
to the first thing and you will",00:25:27.740,00:25:30.910
approve credit.,00:25:30.910,00:25:31.890
"If it's negative, you belong here
and you will deny credit.",00:25:31.890,00:25:34.880
"Well, the function that takes a real
number, and produces the sign +1 or",00:25:34.880,00:25:38.440
"-1, is called the sign.",00:25:38.440,00:25:41.010
"So when you take the sign of this thing,
this will indeed be +1 or",00:25:41.010,00:25:43.930
"-1, and this will give
the decision you want.",00:25:43.930,00:25:46.970
"And that will be the form
of your hypothesis.",00:25:46.970,00:25:49.820
"Now let's put it in color, and you
realize that what defines h is your",00:25:49.820,00:25:57.640
choice of w_i and the threshold.,00:25:57.640,00:26:00.290
"These are the parameters that define
one hypothesis versus the other.",00:26:00.290,00:26:05.060
"x is an input that will be
put into any hypothesis.",00:26:05.060,00:26:07.820
"As far as we are concerned, when we are
learning for example, the inputs",00:26:07.820,00:26:11.780
and outputs are already determined.,00:26:11.780,00:26:13.610
These are the data set.,00:26:13.610,00:26:15.010
"But what we vary to get one hypothesis
or another, and what the algorithm",00:26:15.010,00:26:19.640
"needs to vary in order to choose the
final hypothesis, are those parameters",00:26:19.640,00:26:23.270
"which, in this case, are
w_i and the threshold.",00:26:23.270,00:26:27.270
So let's look at it visually.,00:26:28.810,00:26:30.610
"Let's assume that the data
you are working",00:26:30.610,00:26:32.990
with is linearly separable.,00:26:32.990,00:26:34.790
"Linearly separable in this case, for
example, you have nine data points.",00:26:34.790,00:26:38.770
"And if you look at the nine data
points, some of them were good",00:26:38.770,00:26:42.220
"customers and some of them
were bad customers.",00:26:42.220,00:26:44.850
"And you would like now to apply the
perceptron model, in order to separate",00:26:44.850,00:26:48.450
them correctly.,00:26:48.450,00:26:49.460
"You would like to get to this situation,
where the perceptron, which",00:26:49.460,00:26:53.860
"is this purple line, separates the blue
region from the red region or the",00:26:53.860,00:26:57.680
"pink region, and indeed all the good
customers belong to one, and the bad",00:26:57.680,00:27:02.240
customers belong to the other.,00:27:02.240,00:27:03.600
"So you have hope that a future customer,
if they lie here or lie",00:27:03.600,00:27:07.100
"here, they will be classified
correctly.",00:27:07.100,00:27:09.152
"If there is actually a simple linear
pattern to this to be detected.",00:27:09.152,00:27:12.780
"But when you start, you start with
random weights, and the random weights",00:27:12.780,00:27:16.950
will give you any line.,00:27:16.950,00:27:18.990
"So the purple line in both
cases corresponds to the",00:27:18.990,00:27:23.490
purple parameters there.,00:27:23.490,00:27:25.900
"One choice of these w's and the
threshold corresponds to one line.",00:27:25.900,00:27:30.370
"You change them, you get another line.",00:27:30.370,00:27:32.220
"So you can see that the learning
algorithm is playing around with these",00:27:32.220,00:27:35.410
"parameters, and therefore moving the
line around, trying to arrive at this",00:27:35.410,00:27:39.360
happy solution.,00:27:39.360,00:27:40.950
"Now we are going to have a simple
change of notation.",00:27:42.350,00:27:45.620
"Instead of calling it threshold, we're
going to treat it as if it's a weight.",00:27:45.620,00:27:51.000
"It was minus threshold.
Now we call it, plus w_0.",00:27:51.000,00:27:55.030
"Absolutely nothing, all you need
to do is choose w_0 to",00:27:55.030,00:27:58.760
be minus the threshold.,00:27:58.760,00:28:00.930
No big deal.,00:28:00.930,00:28:01.840
So why do we do that?,00:28:03.060,00:28:04.750
"We do that because we are going to
introduce an artificial coordinate.",00:28:04.750,00:28:08.220
"Remember that the input
was x_1 through x_d.",00:28:08.220,00:28:11.780
Now we're going to add x_0.,00:28:11.780,00:28:14.020
"This is not an attribute of
the customer, but",00:28:14.020,00:28:15.910
"an artificial constant we add, which
happens to be always +1.",00:28:15.910,00:28:20.460
"Why are we doing this?
You probably guessed.",00:28:20.460,00:28:22.710
"Because when you do that, then all of
a sudden the formula simplifies.",00:28:22.710,00:28:26.540
"Now you are summing from i equals
0, instead of i equals 1.",00:28:26.540,00:28:30.040
"So you added the zero term,
and what is the zero term?",00:28:30.040,00:28:33.410
"It's the threshold which you
conveniently call w_0 with a plus sign,",00:28:33.410,00:28:37.270
multiplied by the 1.,00:28:37.270,00:28:38.390
"So indeed, this will be the formula
equivalent to that.",00:28:38.390,00:28:41.550
So it looks better.,00:28:41.550,00:28:43.340
"And this is the standard notation
we're going to use.",00:28:43.340,00:28:46.490
"And now we put it as a vector
form, which will simplify matters, so",00:28:46.490,00:28:51.720
"in this case you will be having an inner
product between a vector w,",00:28:51.720,00:28:56.200
"a column vector, and a vector x.",00:28:56.200,00:28:59.190
"So the vector w would be w_0,
w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, et cetera.",00:28:59.190,00:29:04.870
"And x_0, x_1, x_2, et cetera.",00:29:04.870,00:29:07.030
"And you do the inner product by taking
a transpose, and you get a formula",00:29:07.030,00:29:10.180
"which is exactly the formula
you have here.",00:29:10.180,00:29:12.200
"So now we are down to this formula
for the perceptron hypothesis.",00:29:12.200,00:29:17.330
"Now that we have the hypothesis set,
let's look for the learning algorithm",00:29:19.010,00:29:22.540
that goes with it.,00:29:22.540,00:29:23.500
"The hypothesis set tells you the
resources you can work with.",00:29:23.500,00:29:27.170
"Now we need the algorithm that is
going to look at the data, the",00:29:27.170,00:29:29.990
"training data that you're going to use,
and navigate through the space",00:29:29.990,00:29:33.810
"of hypotheses, to bring the one that
is going to output as the final",00:29:33.810,00:29:37.380
"hypothesis that you give
to your customer.",00:29:37.380,00:29:39.660
"So this one is called the perceptron
learning algorithm, and it implements",00:29:39.660,00:29:47.210
this function.,00:29:47.210,00:29:49.420
What it does is the following.,00:29:49.420,00:29:51.610
It takes the training data.,00:29:51.610,00:29:54.560
"That is always what a learning
algorithm does. This is",00:29:54.560,00:29:56.710
their starting point.,00:29:56.710,00:29:58.020
"So it takes existing customers, and
their existing credit behavior in",00:29:58.020,00:30:03.330
hindsight--,00:30:03.330,00:30:04.030
that's what it uses--,00:30:04.030,00:30:05.380
and what does it do?,00:30:05.380,00:30:07.070
It tries to make the w correct.,00:30:07.070,00:30:12.080
"So it really doesn't like at all
when a point is misclassified.",00:30:12.080,00:30:17.640
"So if a point is misclassified,
it means that your w didn't do",00:30:17.640,00:30:22.960
the right job here.,00:30:22.960,00:30:23.850
"So what does it mean to be
a misclassified point here?",00:30:23.850,00:30:26.640
"It means that when you apply your
formula, with the current w--",00:30:26.640,00:30:31.910
"the w is the one that the algorithm
will play with--",00:30:31.910,00:30:34.340
apply it to this particular x.,00:30:34.340,00:30:37.340
Then what happens?,00:30:37.340,00:30:38.170
"You get something that is not the
credit behavior you want.",00:30:38.170,00:30:41.200
It is misclassified.,00:30:41.200,00:30:43.500
"So what do we do when a point
is misclassified?",00:30:43.500,00:30:45.150
We have to do something.,00:30:45.150,00:30:46.840
"So what the algorithm does, it
updates the weight vector.",00:30:46.840,00:30:49.660
"It changes the weight, which changes
the hypothesis, so that it behaves",00:30:49.660,00:30:53.480
better on that particular point.,00:30:53.480,00:30:55.840
And this is the formula that it does.,00:30:55.840,00:30:59.970
So I'll explain it in a moment.,00:30:59.970,00:31:01.480
"Let me first try to explain the inner
product in terms of agreement or",00:31:01.480,00:31:08.430
disagreement.,00:31:08.430,00:31:10.770
"If you have the vector x and the vector
w this way, their inner product",00:31:10.770,00:31:16.890
"will be positive, and the sign
will give you a +1.",00:31:16.890,00:31:21.230
"If they are this way, the inner product
will be negative, and the sign",00:31:21.230,00:31:25.440
will be -1.,00:31:25.440,00:31:27.550
"So being misclassified means that
either they are this way and the",00:31:27.550,00:31:32.180
"output should be -1, or it's this
way and output should be +1.",00:31:32.180,00:31:37.590
"That's what makes it misclassified,
right?",00:31:37.590,00:31:40.840
"So if you look here at this formula, it
takes the old w and adds something",00:31:41.750,00:31:49.720
"that depends on the misclassified
point.",00:31:49.720,00:31:52.130
Both in terms of the x_n and y_n.,00:31:52.130,00:31:55.280
y_n is just +1 or -1.,00:31:55.280,00:31:57.410
"So here you are either adding a vector
or subtracting a vector.",00:31:57.410,00:32:00.800
"And we will see from this diagram that
you're always doing so in such a way",00:32:00.800,00:32:05.490
"that you make the point more likely
to be correctly classified.",00:32:05.490,00:32:09.520
How is that?,00:32:09.520,00:32:10.780
"If y equals +1, as you see here,
then it must be that since the point",00:32:10.780,00:32:15.990
"is misclassified, that
w dot x was negative.",00:32:15.990,00:32:19.530
"Now when you modify this to w plus
y x, it's actually w plus x.",00:32:19.530,00:32:24.900
"You add x to w, and when you add x to
w you get the blue vector instead of",00:32:24.900,00:32:29.330
the red vector.,00:32:29.330,00:32:30.120
"And lo and behold, now the inner
product is indeed positive.",00:32:30.120,00:32:33.850
"And in the other case when it's -1,
it is misclassified because they",00:32:33.850,00:32:38.830
were this way.,00:32:38.830,00:32:39.760
"They give you +1 when
it should be -1.",00:32:39.760,00:32:41.840
"And when you apply the rule, since
y is -1, you are actually",00:32:41.840,00:32:44.520
subtracting x.,00:32:44.520,00:32:45.640
"So you subtract x and get this guy,
and you will get the correct",00:32:45.640,00:32:48.680
classification.,00:32:48.680,00:32:49.620
So this is the intuition behind it.,00:32:49.810,00:32:51.560
"However, it is not the intuition
that makes this work.",00:32:51.560,00:32:53.990
"There are a number of problems
with this approach.",00:32:53.990,00:32:58.930
"I just motivated that
this is not a crazy rule.",00:32:58.930,00:33:02.570
"Whether or not it's a working
rule, that is yet to be seen.",00:33:02.570,00:33:06.660
"Let's look at the iterations of
the perceptron learning algorithm.",00:33:06.660,00:33:11.270
Here is one iteration of PLA.,00:33:11.270,00:33:13.860
"So you look at this thing, and you have
this current w corresponds to",00:33:13.860,00:33:18.950
the purple line.,00:33:18.950,00:33:20.330
This guy is blue in the red region.,00:33:20.330,00:33:22.760
It means it's misclassified.,00:33:22.760,00:33:24.610
"So now you would like to adjust
the weights, that is move around",00:33:24.610,00:33:28.630
"that purple line, such that the
point is classified correctly.",00:33:28.630,00:33:32.340
"If you apply the learning rule, you'll
find that you're actually moving in",00:33:32.340,00:33:35.440
"this direction, which means that the
blue point will likely be correctly",00:33:35.440,00:33:40.210
classified after that iteration.,00:33:40.210,00:33:42.230
"There is a problem because, let's
say that I actually move",00:33:43.790,00:33:46.930
this guy in this direction.,00:33:46.930,00:33:49.700
"Well this one, I got it right, but this
one, which used to be right,",00:33:49.700,00:33:55.010
now is messed up.,00:33:55.010,00:33:56.440
"It moved to the blue region, right?",00:33:56.440,00:33:58.920
"And if you think about it, I'm trying
to take care of one point, and I may be",00:33:58.920,00:34:02.440
"messing up all other points, because
I'm not taking them into",00:34:02.440,00:34:05.450
consideration.,00:34:05.450,00:34:06.980
"Well, the good news for the perceptron",00:34:06.980,00:34:08.469
"learning algorithm is that all you need
to do, is for iterations 1,",00:34:08.469,00:34:12.909
"2, 3, 4, et cetera, pick a misclassified
point, anyone you like.",00:34:12.909,00:34:19.179
And then apply the iteration to it.,00:34:22.020,00:34:24.489
"The iteration we just talked about,
which is this one.",00:34:24.489,00:34:27.870
The top one.,00:34:27.870,00:34:29.480
And that's it.,00:34:29.480,00:34:31.210
"If you do that, and the data was
originally linearly separable, then",00:34:31.210,00:34:35.790
"you will end up with the case that you
will get to a correct solution.",00:34:35.790,00:34:40.310
"You will get to something that
classifies all of them correctly.",00:34:40.310,00:34:42.870
This is not an obvious statement.,00:34:42.870,00:34:44.340
It requires a proof.,00:34:44.340,00:34:45.310
The proof is not that hard.,00:34:45.310,00:34:47.300
"But it gives us the simplest possible
learning model we can think of.",00:34:47.300,00:34:51.570
"It's a linear model, and
this is your algorithm.",00:34:51.570,00:34:54.710
"All you need to do is be very patient,
because 1, 2, 3, 4-- this is",00:34:54.710,00:34:59.060
a really long.,00:34:59.060,00:35:00.200
At times it can be very long.,00:35:00.200,00:35:01.900
But it eventually converges.,00:35:01.900,00:35:03.310
"That's the promise,",00:35:03.310,00:35:04.350
"as long as the data is
linearly separable.",00:35:04.350,00:35:06.970
"So now we have one learning model, and
if I give you now data from a bank--",00:35:06.970,00:35:13.920
"previous customers and their credit
behavior-- you can actually run the",00:35:13.920,00:35:17.216
"perceptron learning algorithm, and come up
with a final hypothesis g that you",00:35:17.216,00:35:21.090
can hand to the bank.,00:35:21.090,00:35:22.630
"Not clear at all that it will be good,
because all you did was match the",00:35:22.630,00:35:26.390
historical records.,00:35:26.390,00:35:27.750
"Well, you may ask the question: if I
match the historical records, does this",00:35:27.750,00:35:31.280
"mean that I'm getting future customers
right, which is the",00:35:31.280,00:35:34.300
only thing that matters?,00:35:34.300,00:35:35.480
"The bank already knows what happened
with the previous customers. It's just",00:35:35.480,00:35:38.240
"using the data to help you
find a good formula.",00:35:38.240,00:35:41.050
"The formula will be good or not good to
the extent that it applies to a new",00:35:41.050,00:35:44.050
"customer, and can predict the
behavior correctly.",00:35:44.050,00:35:47.510
"Well, that's a loaded question
which will be handled in",00:35:47.510,00:35:50.530
"extreme detail, when we talk about
the theory of learning.",00:35:50.530,00:35:53.470
"That's why we have to develop
all of this theory.",00:35:53.470,00:35:57.190
"So, that's it.",00:35:57.190,00:35:58.970
"And that is the perceptron
learning algorithm.",00:35:58.970,00:36:02.340
"Now let me go into the bigger picture
of learning, because what I talked",00:36:02.340,00:36:07.620
about so far is one type of learning.,00:36:07.620,00:36:09.990
"It happens to be by far the most
popular, and the most used.",00:36:09.990,00:36:13.700
But there are other types of learning.,00:36:13.700,00:36:16.250
"So let's talk about the premise of
learning, from which the different",00:36:16.250,00:36:21.540
types came about.,00:36:21.540,00:36:24.180
That's what learning is about.,00:36:24.180,00:36:27.220
"This is the premise that is common
between any problem that you",00:36:29.630,00:36:34.640
would consider learning.,00:36:34.640,00:36:36.650
"You use a set of observations,
what we call data, to uncover",00:36:36.650,00:36:41.450
an underlying process.,00:36:41.450,00:36:43.280
"In our case, the target function.",00:36:43.280,00:36:46.540
"You can see that this is
a very broad premise.",00:36:46.540,00:36:51.170
"And therefore, you can see that people
have rediscovered that over and over",00:36:51.170,00:36:54.730
"and over, in so many disciplines.",00:36:54.730,00:36:57.160
"Can you think of a discipline, other than
machine learning, that uses that",00:36:57.160,00:37:00.870
as its exclusive premise?,00:37:00.870,00:37:02.125
"Anybody have taken courses
in statistics?",00:37:05.420,00:37:09.460
"In statistics, that's what they do.",00:37:09.460,00:37:12.180
"The underlying process is
a probability distribution.",00:37:12.180,00:37:16.090
"And the observations are samples
generated by that distribution.",00:37:16.090,00:37:21.590
"And you want to take the samples, and
predict what the probability",00:37:21.590,00:37:24.220
distribution is.,00:37:24.220,00:37:25.890
"And over and over, there are so many
disciplines under different names.",00:37:25.890,00:37:29.740
"Now when we talk about different types
of learning, it's not like we sit down",00:37:29.740,00:37:34.000
"and look at the world and say, this
looks different from this because the",00:37:34.000,00:37:37.970
assumptions look different.,00:37:37.970,00:37:39.420
"What you do is, you take this premise
and apply it in a context.",00:37:39.420,00:37:43.700
"And that calls for a certain amount
of mathematics and algorithms.",00:37:43.700,00:37:48.100
"If a particular set of assumptions takes
you sufficiently far from the",00:37:48.100,00:37:53.690
"mathematics and the algorithms you used
in the other disciplines, that",00:37:53.690,00:37:57.850
it takes on a life of its own.,00:37:57.850,00:38:00.360
"And it develops its own math and
algorithms, then you declare it",00:38:00.360,00:38:03.900
a different type.,00:38:03.900,00:38:05.250
"So when I list the types, it's not
completely obvious just by the slide",00:38:05.660,00:38:09.750
"itself, that these should be
the types that you have.",00:38:09.750,00:38:13.000
"But for what it's worth, these
are the most important types.",00:38:13.000,00:38:16.370
"First one is supervised learning,
that's what we have",00:38:16.370,00:38:18.110
been talking about.,00:38:18.110,00:38:18.970
"And I will discuss it in detail, and tell
you why it's called supervised.",00:38:18.970,00:38:22.240
"And it is, by far, the concentration
of this course.",00:38:22.240,00:38:26.640
"There is another one which is called
unsupervised learning, and",00:38:26.640,00:38:31.950
"unsupervised learning
is very intriguing.",00:38:31.950,00:38:33.990
"I will mention it briefly here, and then
we will talk about a very famous",00:38:33.990,00:38:37.310
"algorithm for unsupervised learning
later in the course.",00:38:37.310,00:38:40.740
"And the final type is reinforcement
learning, which is even more",00:38:40.740,00:38:44.090
"intriguing, and I will
discuss it in a brief",00:38:44.090,00:38:47.640
introduction in a moment.,00:38:47.640,00:38:49.760
So let's take them one by one.,00:38:50.330,00:38:52.290
Supervised learning.,00:38:52.290,00:38:53.180
So what is supervised learning?,00:38:53.180,00:38:54.460
"Anytime you have the data that is
given to you, with the output",00:38:56.960,00:39:01.320
"explicitly given-- here is the user
and movie, and here is the rating.",00:39:01.320,00:39:07.630
"Here is the previous customer, and
here is their credit behavior.",00:39:07.630,00:39:11.030
"It's as if a supervisor is helping you
out, in order to be able to classify",00:39:11.030,00:39:15.270
the future ones.,00:39:15.270,00:39:16.300
That's why it's called supervised.,00:39:16.300,00:39:18.140
"Let's take an example of coin
recognition, just to be able to",00:39:18.140,00:39:21.160
"contrast it with unsupervised
learning in a moment.",00:39:21.160,00:39:24.110
"Let's say you have a vending machine,
and you would like to make",00:39:24.630,00:39:29.350
"the system able to
recognize the coins.",00:39:29.350,00:39:31.670
So what do you do?,00:39:31.670,00:39:33.030
"You have physical measurements of the
coin, let's be simplistic and say we",00:39:33.030,00:39:36.630
"measure the size and mass
of the coin you put.",00:39:36.630,00:39:39.520
"Now the coins will be quarters,
nickels, pennies, and dimes.",00:39:39.520,00:39:44.980
"25, 5, 1, and 10.",00:39:44.980,00:39:46.800
"And when you put the data in this
diagram, they will belong there.",00:39:47.500,00:39:51.760
"So the quarters, for example, are
bigger, so they will belong here.",00:39:51.760,00:39:56.640
"And the dimes in the US currency happen
to be the smallest of them,",00:39:56.640,00:40:00.480
"so they are smallest here, and there
will be a scatter because of the error",00:40:00.480,00:40:04.200
"in measurement, because of the exposure
to the elements, and whatnot.",00:40:04.200,00:40:07.160
"So let's say that this is your
training data, and it's supervised",00:40:07.160,00:40:10.070
because things are colored.,00:40:10.070,00:40:11.830
"I gave you those and told you they
are 25 cents, 5 cents, et cetera.",00:40:11.830,00:40:15.660
"So you use those in order to train
a system, and the system will then be",00:40:15.660,00:40:20.040
able to classify a future one.,00:40:20.040,00:40:22.100
"For example, if we stick to the
linear approach, you may be able to",00:40:22.100,00:40:26.990
find separator lines like those.,00:40:26.990,00:40:29.890
"And those separator lines will
separate, based on the data, the 10",00:40:29.890,00:40:33.250
"from the 1 from the
5 from the 25.",00:40:33.250,00:40:35.510
"And once you have those,",00:40:35.510,00:40:37.240
"you can bid farewell to the data.
You don't need it anymore.",00:40:37.240,00:40:39.870
"And when you get a future coin that is
now unlabeled, you don't know what it",00:40:39.870,00:40:42.960
"is, when the vending machine is actually
working, then the coin will",00:40:42.960,00:40:47.220
"lie in one region or another, and you're
going to classify it accordingly.",00:40:47.220,00:40:51.090
So that is supervised learning.,00:40:51.090,00:40:53.550
"Now let's look at unsupervised
learning.",00:40:53.550,00:40:56.060
"For unsupervised learning, instead of
having the examples, the training data,",00:40:56.060,00:41:01.490
"having this form which is the
input plus the correct",00:41:01.490,00:41:05.570
target-- the correct output--,00:41:05.570,00:41:07.020
"the customer and how they behaved
in reality in credit,",00:41:07.020,00:41:12.470
"we are going to have examples that have
less information, so much less it",00:41:12.470,00:41:16.765
is laughable.,00:41:16.765,00:41:19.480
"I'm just going to tell you
what the input is.",00:41:19.480,00:41:23.920
"And I'm not going to tell you what
the target function is at all.",00:41:23.920,00:41:27.330
"I'm not going to tell you anything
about the target function.",00:41:27.330,00:41:30.190
"I'm just going to tell you, here
is the data of a customer.",00:41:30.190,00:41:32.770
"Good luck, try to predict the credit.",00:41:32.770,00:41:36.210
OK--,00:41:36.210,00:41:38.300
"How in the world are we
going to do that?",00:41:38.300,00:41:41.340
"Let me show you that the situation
is not totally hopeless.",00:41:41.340,00:41:44.810
That's what I'm going to achieve.,00:41:44.810,00:41:46.010
"I'm not going to tell you
how to do it completely.",00:41:46.010,00:41:48.390
"But let me show you that a situation
like that is not totally hopeless.",00:41:48.390,00:41:51.780
Let's go for the coin example.,00:41:52.620,00:41:55.330
"For the coin example, we have
data that looks like this.",00:41:56.240,00:42:01.550
"If I didn't tell you what the
denominations are, the data",00:42:01.550,00:42:05.800
would look like this.,00:42:05.800,00:42:08.530
Right?,00:42:08.530,00:42:09.940
"You have the measurements, but you don't
know, is that a quarter, is",00:42:09.940,00:42:12.220
it-- you don't know.,00:42:12.220,00:42:14.140
"Now honestly, if you look at this
thing, you say I can know",00:42:14.140,00:42:17.970
something from this figure.,00:42:17.970,00:42:19.720
Things tend to cluster together.,00:42:19.720,00:42:21.740
"So I may be able to classify those
clusters into categories, without",00:42:21.740,00:42:25.880
knowing what the categories are.,00:42:25.880,00:42:28.440
"That will be quite
an achievement already.",00:42:28.440,00:42:29.960
"You still don't know whether it's
25 cents, or whatever.",00:42:29.960,00:42:33.110
"But the data actually made you
able to do something that is",00:42:33.110,00:42:36.040
a significant step.,00:42:36.040,00:42:38.630
"You're going to be able to come
up with these boundaries.",00:42:38.630,00:42:42.370
"And now, you are so close to
finding the full system.",00:42:43.160,00:42:46.210
"So unlabeled data actually
can be pretty useful.",00:42:46.210,00:42:49.470
"Obviously, I have seen the colored
ones, so I actually chose the",00:42:49.470,00:42:52.910
"boundaries right because I still
remember them visually.",00:42:52.910,00:42:55.500
"But if you look at the clusters and
you have never heard about that,",00:42:55.500,00:42:58.300
"especially these guys might not
look like two clusters.",00:42:58.300,00:43:02.830
They may look like one cluster.,00:43:02.830,00:43:04.510
"So it actually could be that this is
ambiguous, and indeed in unsupervised",00:43:04.510,00:43:10.260
"learning, the number of clusters
is ambiguous at times.",00:43:10.260,00:43:13.900
"And then, what you do--",00:43:16.040,00:43:18.145
"this is the output of your system.
Now, I can categorize the",00:43:20.740,00:43:23.110
coins into types.,00:43:23.110,00:43:24.960
"I'm just going to call them
types: type 1, type 2,",00:43:24.960,00:43:28.050
"type 3, type 4.",00:43:28.050,00:43:29.260
"I have no idea which belongs to which,
but obviously if someone comes with",00:43:29.260,00:43:33.140
"a single example of a quarter, a dime, 
et cetera, then you are ready to go.",00:43:33.140,00:43:37.420
"Whereas before, you had to have lots of
examples in order to choose where",00:43:37.890,00:43:40.680
exactly to put the boundary.,00:43:40.680,00:43:42.770
"And this is why a set like that,
which looks like complete",00:43:43.880,00:43:47.600
"jungle, is actually useful.",00:43:47.600,00:43:50.160
"Let me give you another interesting
example of unsupervised learning,",00:43:50.160,00:43:52.850
"where I give you the input without the
output, and you are actually in",00:43:52.850,00:43:55.610
a better situation to learn.,00:43:55.610,00:43:58.320
"Let's say that your company or your
school in this case, is sending you",00:43:58.320,00:44:02.290
for a semester in Rio de Janeiro.,00:44:02.290,00:44:05.190
"So you're very excited, and you
decide that you'd better learn some",00:44:05.190,00:44:09.690
"Portuguese, in order to be able to
speak the language when you arrive.",00:44:09.690,00:44:13.660
"Not to worry, when you arrive, there
will be a tutor who teaches you",00:44:14.370,00:44:17.830
Portuguese.,00:44:17.830,00:44:18.400
"But you have a month to go,
and you want to help",00:44:18.400,00:44:20.400
yourself as much as possible.,00:44:20.400,00:44:22.320

only resource you have is a radio",00:44:22.320,00:44:26.620

"So what you do, you just turn
it on whenever you drive.",00:44:30.080,00:44:35.080
"And for an entire month, you're
bombarded with Portuguese.",00:44:35.080,00:44:38.680
"""tudo bem"", ""como vai"", ""valeu"",
stuff like that comes back.",00:44:38.680,00:44:42.890
"After a while, without knowing anything--
it's unsupervised, nobody",00:44:42.890,00:44:45.550
told you the meaning of any word--,00:44:45.550,00:44:47.250
"you start to develop a model of
the language in your mind.",00:44:47.250,00:44:50.870
"You know what the idioms
are, et cetera.",00:44:50.870,00:44:52.370
"You are very eager to know
what actually ""tudo bem"" ",00:44:52.370,00:44:54.930
-- what does that mean?,00:44:54.930,00:44:56.350
"You are ready to learn, and once
you learn it, it's actually",00:44:56.350,00:44:58.380
fixed in your mind.,00:44:58.380,00:44:59.780
"Then when you go there, you will learn
the language faster than if you didn't",00:44:59.780,00:45:03.130
go through this experience.,00:45:03.130,00:45:05.070
"So you can think of unsupervised
learning, in one way or another, as",00:45:05.070,00:45:08.320
"a way of getting a higher-level
representation of the input.",00:45:08.320,00:45:12.300
"Whether it's extremely high level as
in clusters-- you forgot all the",00:45:12.300,00:45:15.580
"attributes and you just tell me a label,
or higher level as in this-- a better",00:45:15.580,00:45:19.680
"representation than just the
crude input into some model",00:45:19.680,00:45:23.620
in your mind.,00:45:23.620,00:45:25.212
"Now let's talk about
reinforcement learning.",00:45:29.280,00:45:32.250
"In this case, it's not as bad
as unsupervised learning.",00:45:32.250,00:45:35.430
"So again, without the benefit of
supervised learning, you don't get",00:45:35.430,00:45:38.970
the correct output.,00:45:38.970,00:45:40.810
"What you do is-- I will
give you the input.",00:45:40.810,00:45:44.550
"OK, thank you very much,
that's very kind.",00:45:44.550,00:45:46.750
What else?,00:45:46.750,00:45:48.580
I'm going to give you some output.,00:45:48.580,00:45:53.450
The correct output?,00:45:53.450,00:45:54.540
No!,00:45:54.540,00:45:55.200
Some output.,00:45:55.200,00:45:56.690
"OK, that's very nice, but doesn't
seem very helpful.",00:45:56.690,00:46:01.070
"It looks now like unsupervised learning,
because in unsupervised learning I",00:46:01.070,00:46:05.100
could give you some output.,00:46:05.100,00:46:06.460
"Here is a dime. Oh, it's a quarter.",00:46:06.460,00:46:08.080
It's some output!,00:46:08.080,00:46:10.490
Such output has no information.,00:46:10.490,00:46:12.740
The information comes from the next one.,00:46:12.740,00:46:16.240
I'm going to grade this output.,00:46:16.240,00:46:19.520
"So that is the information
provided to you.",00:46:19.520,00:46:21.440
"So I'm not explicitly giving you the
output, but when you choose an output,",00:46:21.440,00:46:26.200
"I'm going to tell you how
well you're doing.",00:46:26.200,00:46:28.900
"Reinforcement learning is interesting
because it is mostly our own",00:46:28.900,00:46:31.850
experience in learning.,00:46:31.850,00:46:33.450
"Think of a toddler, and a hot
cup of tea in front of her.",00:46:33.450,00:46:38.060
"She is looking at it, and
she is very curious.",00:46:38.060,00:46:40.610
So she reaches to touch. Ouch!,00:46:40.610,00:46:43.210
And she starts crying.,00:46:43.210,00:46:44.720
"The reward is very negative
for trying.",00:46:44.720,00:46:47.790
"Now next time she looks at it, and she
remembers the previous experience, and",00:46:47.790,00:46:51.325
she doesn't touch it.,00:46:51.325,00:46:52.760
"But there is a certain level of pain,
because there is an unfulfilled",00:46:52.760,00:46:56.120
curiosity.,00:46:56.120,00:46:57.870
"And curiosity killed the cat. In
three or four trials, the toddler",00:46:57.870,00:47:01.860
tries again.,00:47:01.860,00:47:02.530
Maybe now it's OK.,00:47:02.530,00:47:04.100
And Ouch!,00:47:04.100,00:47:05.420
"Eventually from just the grade of the
behavior of to touch it or not to",00:47:05.420,00:47:09.890
"touch it, the toddler will learn not to
touch cups of tea that have smoke",00:47:09.890,00:47:14.290
coming out of them.,00:47:14.290,00:47:15.350
"So that is a case of
reinforcement learning.",00:47:16.060,00:47:18.930
"The most important application, or one
of the most important applications of",00:47:18.930,00:47:22.340
"reinforcement learning, is
in playing games.",00:47:22.340,00:47:26.650
"So backgammon is one of the games,
and think that you want",00:47:28.290,00:47:32.420
a system to learn it.,00:47:32.420,00:47:33.600
"So what you want, you want to take the
current state of the board, and you",00:47:33.600,00:47:40.050
"roll the dice, and then you decide
what is the optimal move in",00:47:40.050,00:47:44.010
order to stand the best chance to win.,00:47:44.010,00:47:45.960
That's the game.,00:47:45.960,00:47:46.830
"So the target function is the
best move given a state.",00:47:46.830,00:47:50.890
"Now, if I have to generate those things
in order for the system to",00:47:50.890,00:47:55.680
"learn, then I must be a pretty good
backgammon player already.",00:47:55.680,00:48:00.430
So now it's a vicious cycle.,00:48:00.430,00:48:03.580
"Now, reinforcement learning
comes in handy.",00:48:03.580,00:48:06.480
"What you're going to do, you
are going to have the",00:48:06.480,00:48:09.030
computer choose any output.,00:48:09.030,00:48:11.070
"A crazy move, for all you care.",00:48:11.070,00:48:13.790
And then see what happens eventually.,00:48:13.790,00:48:16.070
"So this computer is playing against
another computer, both of",00:48:16.070,00:48:19.280
them want to learn.,00:48:19.280,00:48:21.040
"And you make a move, and eventually
you win or lose.",00:48:21.040,00:48:24.730
"So you propagate back the credit
because of winning or losing,",00:48:24.730,00:48:28.280
"according to a very specific and
sophisticated formula, into all the",00:48:28.280,00:48:31.780
moves that happened.,00:48:31.780,00:48:34.810
"Now you think that's completely hopeless,
because maybe this is not the",00:48:34.810,00:48:37.570
"move that resulted in this,
it's another move.",00:48:37.570,00:48:39.750
"But always remember, that you are going
to do this 100 billion times.",00:48:39.750,00:48:45.390
"Not you, the poor computer.",00:48:45.390,00:48:47.130
"You're sitting down sipping
your tea.",00:48:47.130,00:48:49.610
"A computer is doing this, playing
against an imaginary opponent, and",00:48:49.610,00:48:53.460
"they keep playing and
playing and playing.",00:48:53.460,00:48:55.240
"And in three hours of CPU time, you go
back to the computer-- maybe not three",00:48:55.240,00:48:58.530
"hours, maybe three days of CPU time--
you go back to the computer, and you",00:48:58.530,00:49:02.180
have a backgammon champion.,00:49:02.180,00:49:03.505
"Actually, that's true.",00:49:06.430,00:49:09.960
"The world champion, at some point, was
a neural network that learned the way",00:49:09.960,00:49:13.900
I described.,00:49:13.900,00:49:15.880
"So it is actually a very attractive
approach, because in machine",00:49:15.880,00:49:20.730
"learning now, we have a target function
that we cannot model.",00:49:20.730,00:49:24.590
"That covers a lot of territory,
I've seen a lot of those.",00:49:24.590,00:49:27.590
"We have data coming from
the target function.",00:49:27.590,00:49:29.720
I usually have that.,00:49:30.830,00:49:32.560
"And now we have the lazy
man's approach to life.",00:49:32.560,00:49:36.010
"We are going to sit down, and let the
computer do all of the work, and",00:49:36.010,00:49:39.410
produce the system we want.,00:49:39.410,00:49:40.830
"Instead of studying the thing 
mathematically, and writing code, and",00:49:40.830,00:49:44.090
debugging--,00:49:44.090,00:49:44.900
I hate debugging.,00:49:44.900,00:49:46.740
"And then you go. No,
we're not going to do that.",00:49:46.740,00:49:49.650
"The learning algorithm just works,
and produces something good.",00:49:49.650,00:49:52.550
And we get the check.,00:49:53.040,00:49:54.490
So this is a pretty good deal.,00:49:54.490,00:49:56.950
"It actually is so good, it might
be too good to be true.",00:49:56.950,00:50:03.880
"So let's actually examine if
all of this was a fantasy.",00:50:03.880,00:50:07.120
"So now I'm going to give you
a learning puzzle.",00:50:10.590,00:50:14.080
"Humans are very good learners, right?",00:50:14.080,00:50:16.020
"So I'm now going to give you a learning
problem in the form that I",00:50:17.630,00:50:21.170
"described, a supervised
learning problem.",00:50:21.170,00:50:23.870
"And that supervised learning problem
will give you a training set, some",00:50:23.870,00:50:28.910
"points mapped to +1, some
points mapped to -1.",00:50:28.910,00:50:32.300
"And then I'm going to give you
a test point that is unlabeled.",00:50:32.300,00:50:35.600
"Your task is to look at the examples,
learn the target function, apply it to",00:50:35.600,00:50:41.780
"the test point, and then decide what
the value of the function is.",00:50:41.780,00:50:46.630
"After that, I'm going to ask, who
decided that the function is +1,",00:50:46.630,00:50:50.550
"and who decided that the
function is -1.",00:50:50.550,00:50:53.130
OK? It's clear what the deal is.,00:50:53.130,00:50:55.720
"And I would like our online audience
to do the same thing.",00:50:55.730,00:50:59.680
And please text what the solution is.,00:50:59.680,00:51:02.650
Just +1 or -1.,00:51:02.650,00:51:04.900
Fair enough?,00:51:05.590,00:51:06.560
Let's start the game.,00:51:06.560,00:51:07.810
"What is above the line are
the training examples.",00:51:14.890,00:51:19.390
"I put the input as a three-by-three
pattern in order to be visually easy",00:51:19.390,00:51:23.870
to understand.,00:51:23.870,00:51:24.780
"But this is just really nine
bits worth of information.",00:51:24.780,00:51:28.370
"And they are ones and zeros,
black and white.",00:51:28.370,00:51:31.470
"And for this input, this input, and this
input, the value of the target",00:51:31.470,00:51:36.640
function is -1.,00:51:36.640,00:51:38.760
"For this input, this input, and this
input, the value of the target",00:51:38.760,00:51:42.160
function is +1.,00:51:42.160,00:51:44.470
"Now this is your data set, this
is your training set.",00:51:44.470,00:51:47.980
Now you should learn the function.,00:51:47.980,00:51:49.360
"And when you're done, could you please
tell me what your function will return",00:51:49.360,00:51:52.980
on this test point?,00:51:52.980,00:51:54.680
Is it +1 or -1.,00:51:54.680,00:51:57.130
"I will give everybody 30 seconds
before I ask for an answer.",00:51:57.130,00:52:00.480
"Maybe we should have some
background music?",00:52:05.330,00:52:06.930
"OK, time's up.",00:52:20.400,00:52:22.680
"Your learning algorithm
has converged, I hope.",00:52:22.680,00:52:24.850
"And now we apply it here, and I ask
people here, who says it's +1?",00:52:24.850,00:52:30.835
Thank you.,00:52:34.120,00:52:35.180
Who says it's -1?,00:52:35.180,00:52:37.810
Thank you.,00:52:37.810,00:52:39.270
"I see that the online audience
also contributed?",00:52:39.270,00:52:42.020
"MODERATOR: Yeah, the big
majority says +1.",00:52:42.020,00:52:44.070
"PROFESSOR: But
are there -1's?",00:52:44.070,00:52:45.950
MODERATOR: Two -1's.,00:52:45.950,00:52:46.840
PROFESSOR: Cool.,00:52:47.300,00:52:48.320
"I don't care if it's
a +1 or -1.",00:52:49.050,00:52:50.990
"What I care about is that
I get both answers.",00:52:50.990,00:52:54.270
That is the essence of it.,00:52:54.270,00:52:55.810
Why do I care?,00:52:55.810,00:52:57.280
"Because in reality, this
is an impossible task.",00:52:57.280,00:53:00.760
"I told you the target
function is unknown.",00:53:03.470,00:53:06.090
"It could be anything,
really anything.",00:53:06.090,00:53:11.110
"And now I give you the value of the
target function at 6 points.",00:53:11.110,00:53:15.740
"Well, there are many functions that
fit those 6 points, and behave",00:53:15.740,00:53:19.470
differently outside.,00:53:19.470,00:53:21.470
"For example, if you take the function
to be +1 if the top left square",00:53:21.470,00:53:32.400
"is white, then this should
be -1, right?",00:53:32.400,00:53:40.510
"If you take the function to be +1
if the pattern is symmetric--",00:53:40.510,00:53:49.880
"let's see, I said it
the other way around.",00:53:49.880,00:53:52.700
"So the top one is black,
it would be -1.",00:53:52.700,00:53:57.430
So this would be -1.,00:53:57.430,00:53:58.850
"If it's symmetric, it would be +1.",00:53:58.850,00:54:00.680
"So this would be +1, because
this guy has both-- this is",00:54:00.680,00:54:03.420
"black, and also it is symmetric.",00:54:03.420,00:54:05.380
Right?,00:54:05.380,00:54:06.230
"And you can find infinite
variety like that.",00:54:06.230,00:54:09.320
"And that problem is not restricted
to this case.",00:54:09.320,00:54:12.310
The question here is obvious.,00:54:14.300,00:54:15.530
The function is unknown.,00:54:15.530,00:54:17.010
"You really mean unknown, right?",00:54:17.010,00:54:18.300
"Yes, I mean it.",00:54:18.300,00:54:19.430
Unknown-- anything?,00:54:19.430,00:54:20.260
"Yes, I do.",00:54:20.260,00:54:21.280
OK.,00:54:21.280,00:54:22.160
"You give me a finite sample,
it can be anything outside.",00:54:22.160,00:54:26.110
"How in the world am I going to tell
what the learning outside is?",00:54:26.110,00:54:30.750
"OK, that sounds about right.",00:54:30.750,00:54:33.720
"But we are in trouble, because that's
the premise of learning.",00:54:33.720,00:54:37.150
"If the goal was to memorize the examples
I gave you, that would be",00:54:37.150,00:54:41.400
"memorizing, not learning.",00:54:41.400,00:54:43.780
"Learning is to figure out a pattern
that applies outside.",00:54:43.780,00:54:48.110
"And now we realize that outside,
I cannot say anything.",00:54:48.110,00:54:53.370
"Does this mean that learning
is doomed?",00:54:53.370,00:54:56.641
"Well, this is going to be
a very short course!",00:54:56.641,00:55:00.860
"Well, the good news is that learning
is alive and well.",00:55:00.860,00:55:06.230
"And we are going to show that, without
compromising our basic premise.",00:55:06.230,00:55:13.420
"The target function will
continue to be unknown.",00:55:13.420,00:55:18.320
And we still mean unknown.,00:55:18.320,00:55:21.440
And we will be able to learn.,00:55:21.440,00:55:24.390
"And that will be the subject
of the next lecture.",00:55:24.390,00:55:27.620
"Right now, we are going to go for
a short break, after which we are going",00:55:27.620,00:55:32.410
to take the Q&amp;A. ,00:55:32.410,00:55:40.150
"We'll start the Q&amp;A, and we will get
questions from the class here, and",00:55:43.270,00:55:49.350
from the online audience.,00:55:49.350,00:55:51.270
"And if you'd like to ask a question, let
me ask you to go to this side of",00:55:51.270,00:55:56.160
"the room where the mic is, so that
your question can be heard.",00:55:56.160,00:56:00.630
"And we will alternate, if there are
questions here, we will alternate",00:56:00.630,00:56:04.680
between campus and off campus.,00:56:04.680,00:56:07.540
"So let me start if there is
a question from outside.",00:56:07.540,00:56:11.030
"MODERATOR: Yes, so the most common
question is, how do you determine if",00:56:11.030,00:56:16.080
"a set of points is linearly
separable, and what do you do",00:56:16.080,00:56:19.050
if they're not separable.,00:56:19.050,00:56:20.730
"PROFESSOR: The linear separability
assumption is a very",00:56:20.730,00:56:26.120
"simplistic assumption, and doesn't
apply mostly in practice.",00:56:26.120,00:56:29.850
"And I chose it only because it goes with
a very simple algorithm, which is",00:56:29.850,00:56:34.780
the perceptron learning algorithm.,00:56:34.780,00:56:36.950
"There are two ways to deal with the
case of linear inseparability.",00:56:36.950,00:56:40.850
"There are algorithms, and most
algorithms actually deal with that",00:56:40.850,00:56:44.450
"case, and there's also a technique that
we are going to study next",00:56:44.450,00:56:49.730
"week, which will take a set of points
which is not linearly separable, and",00:56:49.730,00:56:55.330
"create a mapping that makes
them linearly separable.",00:56:55.330,00:56:59.150
So there is a way to deal with it.,00:56:59.150,00:57:02.050
"However, the question how do you
determine it's linearly separable, the",00:57:02.050,00:57:05.990
"right way of doing it in practice is
that, when someone gives you data, you",00:57:05.990,00:57:09.240
"assume in general it's not
linearly separable.",00:57:09.240,00:57:11.870
"It will hardly ever be, and therefore
you take techniques that can deal with",00:57:11.870,00:57:15.310
that case as well.,00:57:15.310,00:57:16.630
"There is a simple modification of the
perceptron learning algorithm, which",00:57:16.630,00:57:20.100
"is called the pocket algorithm,",00:57:20.100,00:57:21.670
"that applies the same rule with a very
minor modification, and deals with the",00:57:21.670,00:57:26.190
case where the data is not separable.,00:57:26.190,00:57:29.460
"However, if you apply the perceptron
learning algorithm, that is guaranteed",00:57:29.460,00:57:34.820
"to converge to a correct solution in the
case of linear separability, and",00:57:34.820,00:57:38.990
"you apply it to data that is not
linearly separable, bad things happen.",00:57:38.990,00:57:43.520
"Not only is it going not to converge,
obviously it is not going to converge",00:57:43.520,00:57:46.800
"because it terminates when there are
no misclassified points, right?",00:57:46.800,00:57:50.600
"If there is a misclassified point, then
there's a next iteration always.",00:57:50.600,00:57:53.640
"So since the data is not linearly
separable, we will never come to",00:57:53.640,00:57:56.500
"a point where all the points
are classified correctly.",00:57:56.500,00:57:59.110
So this is not what is bothering us.,00:57:59.110,00:58:01.220
"What is bothering us is that, as you go
from one step to another, you can",00:58:01.220,00:58:04.570
"go from a very good solution
to a terrible solution.",00:58:04.570,00:58:08.040
In the case of no linear separability.,00:58:08.040,00:58:10.450
"So it's not an algorithm that you
would like to use, and just",00:58:10.450,00:58:13.530
terminate by force at an iteration.,00:58:13.530,00:58:15.650
"A modification of it can be used this
way, and I'll mention it briefly when",00:58:15.650,00:58:21.360
"we talk about linear regression
and other linear methods.",00:58:21.360,00:58:26.120
"MODERATOR: There's also a question of
how does the rate of convergence of",00:58:26.120,00:58:29.770
"the perceptron change with the
dimensionality of the data?",00:58:29.770,00:58:33.810
PROFESSOR: Badly!,00:58:33.810,00:58:35.840
That's the answer.,00:58:35.840,00:58:37.200
Let me put it this way.,00:58:37.200,00:58:38.440
"You can build pathological cases, where
it really will take forever.",00:58:38.440,00:58:42.000
"However, I did not give the perceptron
learning algorithm in the first",00:58:42.000,00:58:45.230
"lecture to tell you that this is
the great algorithm that you",00:58:45.230,00:58:47.900
need to learn.,00:58:47.900,00:58:49.160
"I gave it in the first lecture,
because this is simplest",00:58:49.160,00:58:51.720
algorithm I could give.,00:58:51.720,00:58:53.550
"By the end of this course,
you'll be saying, what?",00:58:53.550,00:58:56.990
Perceptron?,00:58:56.990,00:58:57.650
Never heard of it.,00:58:57.650,00:58:58.880
"So it will go out of contention, after we
get to the more interesting stuff.",00:58:58.880,00:59:02.710
"But as a method that can be used, it
indeed can be used, and can be",00:59:03.240,00:59:07.090
"explained in five minutes
as you have seen.",00:59:07.090,00:59:09.710
"MODERATOR: Regarding the items for
learning, you mentioned that there",00:59:09.710,00:59:15.050
must be a pattern.,00:59:15.050,00:59:15.900
So can you be more specific about that?,00:59:15.900,00:59:18.400
How do you know if there's a pattern?,00:59:18.400,00:59:20.590
PROFESSOR: You don't.,00:59:20.590,00:59:21.940
"My answers seem to be very abrupt,
but that's the way it is.",00:59:21.940,00:59:25.840
"When we get to the theory--
is learning feasible-- it will",00:59:25.840,00:59:29.680
"become very clear that there is
a separation between the target",00:59:29.680,00:59:34.060
"function-- there is
a pattern to detect--",00:59:34.060,00:59:35.730
and whether we can learn it.,00:59:35.730,00:59:37.150
"It is very difficult for me to explain
it in two minutes, it will take a full",00:59:37.150,00:59:40.150
lecture to get there.,00:59:40.150,00:59:41.500
"But the essence of it is that you take
the data, you apply your learning",00:59:41.500,00:59:47.600
"algorithm, and there is something you
can explicitly detect that will",00:59:47.600,00:59:52.710
tell you whether you learned or not.,00:59:52.710,00:59:54.890
"So in some cases, you're not
going to be able to learn.",00:59:54.890,00:59:57.630
"In some cases, you'll be able to learn.",00:59:57.630,00:59:59.890
"And the key is that you're going
to be able to tell by",00:59:59.890,01:00:02.630
running your algorithm.,01:00:02.630,01:00:04.440
"And I'm going to explain that
in more details later on.",01:00:04.440,01:00:07.280
"So basically, I'm also resisting
taking the data, deciding",01:00:08.010,01:00:15.660
"whether it's linearly separable, looking
at it and seeing. You will",01:00:15.660,01:00:19.220
"realize as we go through that it's
a no-no to actually look at the data.",01:00:19.220,01:00:25.370
What?,01:00:25.370,01:00:26.860
"That's what data is for, to look at.",01:00:26.860,01:00:29.580
Bear with me.,01:00:29.580,01:00:30.850
"We will come to the level where we ask
why don't we look at the data--",01:00:30.850,01:00:34.720
"just looking at it and then saying:
It's linearly separable.",01:00:34.720,01:00:37.920
Let's pick the perceptron.,01:00:37.920,01:00:39.890
"That's bad practice, for reasons
that are not obvious now.",01:00:39.890,01:00:42.370
"They will become obvious, once we
are done with the theory.",01:00:42.370,01:00:45.460
"So when someone knocks on my door with
a set of data, I can ask them all",01:00:45.460,01:00:50.330
"kinds of questions about the data-- not
the particular data set that they gave",01:00:50.330,01:00:54.360
"me, but about the general data that
is generated by their process.",01:00:54.360,01:00:57.750
"They can tell me this variable is
important, the function is symmetric,",01:00:57.750,01:01:00.570
"they can give you all kinds of
information that I will take to heart.",01:01:00.570,01:01:04.210
"But I will try, as much as I can, to 
avoid looking at the particular data",01:01:04.210,01:01:08.730
"set that they gave me, lest I should
tailor my system toward this data set,",01:01:08.730,01:01:14.680
"and be disappointed when another
data set comes about.",01:01:14.680,01:01:17.680
"You don't want to get too
close to the data set.",01:01:17.680,01:01:20.100
"This will become very clear
as we go with the theory.",01:01:20.100,01:01:24.190
"MODERATOR: In general about
machine learning, how does it",01:01:24.190,01:01:27.190

"When you study linear regression under
statistics, there is a lot of",01:02:04.330,01:02:07.530

assumptions, because that is the",01:02:07.530,01:02:11.020
purpose of the field.,01:02:11.020,01:02:12.640
"In general, machine learning tries to make
the least assumptions and cover the",01:02:12.640,01:02:18.560
most territory. These go together.,01:02:18.560,01:02:22.090

applied discipline.,01:02:25.640,01:02:26.850
"It spans both the mathematical, to
certain extent, but it is willing to",01:02:26.850,01:02:31.270

don't have mathematical models, and",01:02:31.270,01:02:35.870
still want to apply our techniques.,01:02:35.870,01:02:38.040
"So that is what characterizes
it the most.",01:02:38.040,01:02:40.600

By doing machine learning,",01:02:40.600,01:02:44.120
"you can find it under the name
computational learning,",01:02:44.120,01:02:46.400

with that discipline.",01:03:03.690,01:03:06.840

question about machine learning.",01:03:32.010,01:03:36.180
"Do machine learning algorithms perform
global optimization methods,",01:03:36.190,01:03:42.370

a general question.",01:03:45.810,01:03:47.640

for machine learning.",01:03:48.470,01:03:52.120

that does the job for us.",01:03:52.120,01:03:56.340

specific optimization method.",01:03:56.340,01:03:59.440

machines, it will be quadratic",01:03:59.440,01:04:01.470

"It happens to be the one
that works with that.",01:04:01.990,01:04:04.050

that machine learning people",01:04:04.050,01:04:08.190
study for its own sake.,01:04:08.190,01:04:10.000

it better, and to choose the correct",01:04:10.000,01:04:12.840
optimization method.,01:04:12.840,01:04:14.900
"Now, the question is alluding
to something that will",01:04:14.900,01:04:17.780
"become clear when we talk about neural
networks, which is local minimum versus",01:04:17.780,01:04:21.220
global minimum.,01:04:21.220,01:04:22.830

set can be anything, in principle.",01:04:42.470,01:04:47.160

less, the general idea, but I don't",01:05:26.340,01:05:32.930

you gave about credit approval.",01:05:32.930,01:05:37.160

"This is a good point. Every time
someone asks a question, the",01:05:58.030,01:06:04.465
lecture number comes to my mind.,01:06:04.465,01:06:05.590
"I know when I'm going
to talk about it.",01:06:05.590,01:06:07.570

called sampling bias.",01:06:07.570,01:06:10.410

"But when you use the biased data, let's
say the bank uses historical records.",01:06:12.190,01:06:18.450
"So it sees the people who applied and
were accepted, and for those guys, it",01:06:18.450,01:06:22.450
"can actually predict what the credit
behavior is, because it has their",01:06:22.450,01:06:26.030
credit history.,01:06:26.030,01:06:26.700
"They charged and repaid and maxed
out, and all of this.",01:06:26.700,01:06:30.000
"And then they decide: is this
a good customer or not?",01:06:30.000,01:06:32.590
"For those who were rejected, there's
really no way to tell in this case",01:06:32.590,01:06:36.400

works fairly decently.",01:06:44.050,01:06:48.070

other guys, because the other guys",01:06:48.070,01:06:51.300

and turned out to be bad.",01:06:55.060,01:06:57.940
But the point is well taken.,01:06:58.810,01:07:01.000
"The data set in this case is not
completely representative, and there",01:07:01.000,01:07:04.390
"is a particular principle in learning
that we'll talk about, which is",01:07:04.390,01:07:07.750
"sampling bias, that deals
with this case.",01:07:07.750,01:07:11.400
Another question from here?,01:07:11.400,01:07:14.270
"STUDENT: You explain that we need
to have a lot of data to learn.",01:07:14.270,01:07:17.420
"So how do you decide how much amount
of data that is required for",01:07:17.420,01:07:22.050
"a particular problem, in order to be
able to come up with a reasonable--",01:07:22.050,01:07:26.980
PROFESSOR: Good question.,01:07:26.980,01:07:27.930
"So let me tell you the theoretical,
and the practical answer.",01:07:27.930,01:07:31.710
"The theoretical answer is that this is
exactly the crux of the theory part",01:07:31.710,01:07:36.340
that we're going to talk about.,01:07:36.340,01:07:37.810
"And in the theory, we are going
to see, can we learn?",01:07:38.350,01:07:40.950
And how much data.,01:07:40.950,01:07:43.120
"So all of this will be answered
in a mathematical way.",01:07:43.120,01:07:46.150
So this is the theoretical answer.,01:07:46.150,01:07:48.020
"The practical answer is: that's
not under your control.",01:07:48.020,01:07:52.770
"When someone knocks on your door: Here
is the data, I have 500 points.",01:07:52.770,01:07:57.180
"I tell him, I will give you
a fantastic system if you",01:07:57.180,01:08:00.170
just give me 2000.,01:08:00.170,01:08:02.200
"But I don't have 2000, I have 500.",01:08:02.200,01:08:05.000
"So now you go and you use your theory
to do something to your system, such",01:08:05.000,01:08:09.040
that it can work with the 500.,01:08:09.040,01:08:11.000
There was one case--,01:08:11.710,01:08:12.600
"I worked with data in different
applications--",01:08:12.600,01:08:16.930
"at some point, we had almost
100 million points.",01:08:16.930,01:08:20.330
You were swimming in data.,01:08:20.330,01:08:21.760
You wouldn't complain about data.,01:08:21.760,01:08:23.279
Data was wonderful.,01:08:23.279,01:08:25.200
"And in another case, there were
less than 100 points.",01:08:25.200,01:08:28.779
"And you had to deal with
the data with gloves!",01:08:28.779,01:08:31.890
"Because if you use them the wrong way,
they are contaminated, which is",01:08:31.890,01:08:36.290
"an expression we will see, and
then you have nothing.",01:08:36.290,01:08:38.970
"And you will produce a system, and you
are proud of it, but you have no idea",01:08:38.970,01:08:43.029
whether it will perform well or not.,01:08:43.029,01:08:44.540
"And you cannot give this to the customer,
and have the customer come",01:08:44.540,01:08:46.899
back to you and say: what did you do!?,01:08:46.899,01:08:49.300
"So there is a question of, what
performance can you do given",01:08:49.760,01:08:55.490
what data size you have?,01:08:55.490,01:08:57.090
"But in practice, you really have no
control over the data size in almost",01:08:57.090,01:09:00.520
"all the cases, almost all
the practical cases.",01:09:00.520,01:09:03.140
Yes?,01:09:03.140,01:09:05.960
"STUDENT: Another question I have
is regarding the hypothesis set.",01:09:05.960,01:09:10.540
"So the larger the hypothesis set
is, probably I'll be able to",01:09:10.540,01:09:13.729
better fit the data.,01:09:13.729,01:09:15.649
"But that, as you were explaining, might
be a bad thing to do because",01:09:15.649,01:09:20.420
"when the new data point comes,
there might be troubles.",01:09:20.420,01:09:23.460
"So how do you decide
the size of your--",01:09:23.460,01:09:25.210
"PROFESSOR: You are asking all
the right questions, and all of",01:09:25.210,01:09:27.680
them are coming up.,01:09:27.680,01:09:28.350
"This is again part of the theory,
but let me try to explain this.",01:09:28.350,01:09:32.330
"As we mentioned, learning is about
being able to predict.",01:09:32.330,01:09:35.420
"So you are using the data, not to
memorize it, but to figure out what",01:09:35.420,01:09:40.510
the pattern is.,01:09:40.510,01:09:42.130
"And if you figure out a pattern that
applies to all the data, and it's",01:09:42.130,01:09:45.100
"a reasonable pattern, then you
have a chance that it",01:09:45.100,01:09:47.216
will generalize outside.,01:09:47.216,01:09:49.340
"Now the problem is that, if I give you
50 points, and you use a 7000th-order",01:09:49.340,01:09:53.880
"polynomial, you will fit the
heck out of the data.",01:09:53.880,01:09:57.360
"You will fit it so much with so many
degrees of freedom to spare, but you",01:09:57.360,01:10:01.160
haven't learned anything.,01:10:01.160,01:10:02.070
You just memorized it in a fancy way.,01:10:02.070,01:10:04.610
"You put it in a polynomial form, and
that actually carries all the",01:10:04.610,01:10:08.500
"information about the
data that you have,",01:10:08.500,01:10:10.400
and then some.,01:10:10.400,01:10:11.890
"So you don't expect at all that
this will generalize outside.",01:10:11.890,01:10:15.280
"And that intuitive observation
will be formalized when we",01:10:15.280,01:10:18.450
talk about the theory.,01:10:18.450,01:10:19.580
"There will be a measurement of the
hypothesis set that you give me, that",01:10:19.580,01:10:22.930
"measures the sophistication of it,
and will tell you with that",01:10:22.930,01:10:25.550
"sophistication, you need that amount
of data in order to be able to make",01:10:25.550,01:10:28.850
any statement about generalization.,01:10:28.850,01:10:30.430
So that is what the theory is about.,01:10:30.430,01:10:31.680
"STUDENT: Suppose, I mean, here
whatever we discussed, it is like I",01:10:34.650,01:10:37.880
"had a data set and I came up with
an algorithm, and gave the output.",01:10:37.880,01:10:42.930
"But won't it be also important to see,
OK, we came up with the output, and",01:10:42.930,01:10:48.690
"using that, what was the feedback?",01:10:48.690,01:10:52.790
"Are there techniques where you take
the feedback and try to",01:10:52.790,01:10:57.690
correct your--,01:10:57.690,01:10:58.980
"PROFESSOR: You are alluding
to different techniques here.",01:10:58.980,01:11:03.360
"But one of them would be validation,
which is after you learn, you validate",01:11:03.360,01:11:07.740
your solution.,01:11:07.740,01:11:09.360
"And this is an extremely established and
core technique in machine learning",01:11:09.360,01:11:13.000
"that will be covered in
one of the lectures.",01:11:13.000,01:11:16.870
Any questions from the online audience?,01:11:16.870,01:11:18.810
"MODERATOR: In practice, how many
dimensions would be considered easy,",01:11:18.810,01:11:25.780
"medium, and hard for
a perceptron problem?",01:11:25.780,01:11:28.730
"PROFESSOR: The hard,",01:11:28.730,01:11:31.100
"in most people's mind before they
get into machine learning, is the",01:11:31.100,01:11:34.850
computational time.,01:11:34.850,01:11:36.420
"If something takes a lot of time,
then it's a hard problem.",01:11:36.420,01:11:38.800
"If something can be computed quickly,
it's an easy problem.",01:11:38.800,01:11:42.800
"For machine learning, the bottleneck
in my case, has never been the",01:11:42.800,01:11:47.210
"computation time, even in
incredibly big data sets.",01:11:47.210,01:11:51.340
"The bottleneck for machine learning is
to be able to generalize outside the",01:11:51.340,01:11:55.410
data that you have seen.,01:11:55.410,01:11:56.990
"So to answer your question, the
perceptron behaves badly in terms of",01:11:56.990,01:12:01.790
the computational behavior.,01:12:01.790,01:12:04.090
"We will be able to predict its
generalization behavior, based on the",01:12:04.090,01:12:07.490
"number of dimensions and
the amount of data.",01:12:07.490,01:12:09.370
This will be given explicitly.,01:12:09.370,01:12:11.610
"And therefore, the perceptron algorithm
is bad computationally, good",01:12:11.610,01:12:19.030
in terms of generalization.,01:12:19.030,01:12:20.980
"If you actually can get away with
perceptrons, your chances of",01:12:20.980,01:12:24.900
"generalizing are good because
it's a simplistic",01:12:24.900,01:12:28.460
"model, and therefore its ability to
generalize is good, as we will see.",01:12:28.460,01:12:33.850
"MODERATOR: Also, in the example you
explain the use of binary function.",01:12:33.850,01:12:38.010
"So can you use more multi-valued
or real functions?",01:12:38.010,01:12:43.690
PROFESSOR: Correct.,01:12:43.690,01:12:45.100
"Remember when I told you that there is
a topic that is out of sequence.",01:12:45.100,01:12:47.980
"There was a logical sequence to the
course, and then I took part of the",01:12:47.980,01:12:51.810
"linear models and put it very early on,
to give you something a little bit",01:12:51.810,01:12:55.870
"more sophisticated than perceptrons
to try your hand on.",01:12:55.870,01:12:59.140
"That happens to be for
real-valued functions.",01:12:59.140,01:13:01.560
"And obviously there are hypotheses that
cover all types of co-domains.",01:13:01.560,01:13:05.650
Y could be anything as well.,01:13:05.650,01:13:07.010
"MODERATOR: Another question is, in
the learning process you showed, when",01:13:09.930,01:13:18.730
"do you pick your learning algorithm,
when do you pick your hypothesis set,",01:13:18.730,01:13:22.420
and what liberty do you have?,01:13:22.420,01:13:23.840
"PROFESSOR: The hypothesis set
is the most important aspect of",01:13:28.380,01:13:33.070
"determining the generalization behavior
that we'll talk about.",01:13:33.070,01:13:36.030
"The learning algorithm does play a role,
although it is a secondary role,",01:13:36.030,01:13:38.960
as we will see in the discussion.,01:13:38.960,01:13:41.330
"So in general, the learning
algorithm has the form of",01:13:41.330,01:13:45.960
minimizing an error function.,01:13:45.960,01:13:49.140
"So you can think of the
perceptron, what does",01:13:49.140,01:13:51.540
the algorithm do?,01:13:51.540,01:13:52.290
"It tries to minimize the
classification error.",01:13:52.290,01:13:55.420
"That is your error function, and
you're minimizing it using this",01:13:55.420,01:13:58.710
particular update rule.,01:13:58.710,01:14:00.220
"And in other cases, we'll see that we
are minimizing an error function.",01:14:00.220,01:14:03.700
"Now the minimization aspect is
an optimization question, and once you",01:14:03.700,01:14:08.000
"determine that this is indeed the
error function that I want to",01:14:08.000,01:14:11.180
"minimize, then you go and minimize
as much as you can using the most",01:14:11.180,01:14:15.950
"sophisticated optimization
technique that you find.",01:14:15.950,01:14:18.710
"So the question now translates into
what is the choice of the error",01:14:18.710,01:14:22.160
"function or error measure that
will help or not help.",01:14:22.160,01:14:26.280
"And that will be covered also next week
under the topic, Error and Noise.",01:14:26.280,01:14:29.530
"When I talk about error, we'll talk
about error measures, and this",01:14:29.530,01:14:32.350
"translates directly to the learning
algorithm that goes with them.",01:14:32.350,01:14:37.660
MODERATOR: Back to the perceptron.,01:14:37.660,01:14:38.730
"So what happens if your hypothesis
gives you exactly 0 in this case?",01:14:38.730,01:14:43.220
"PROFESSOR: So remember that
the quantity you compute and",01:14:43.220,01:14:47.200
"compare with the threshold
was your credit score.",01:14:47.200,01:14:49.960
"So I told you what happens if you are
above threshold, and what happens if",01:14:49.960,01:14:53.090
you're below threshold.,01:14:53.090,01:14:54.760
"So what happens if you're exactly
at the threshold?",01:14:54.760,01:14:57.430
Your score is exactly that.,01:14:57.430,01:15:02.340
"The informal answer is that it depends
on the mood of the credit",01:15:02.340,01:15:07.080
officer on that day.,01:15:07.080,01:15:08.650
"If they had a bad day,
you will be denied!",01:15:08.650,01:15:10.870
"But the serious answer is that
there are technical ways of",01:15:10.870,01:15:16.410
defining that point.,01:15:16.410,01:15:17.870
"You can define it as 0,
so the sign of 0 is 0.",01:15:17.870,01:15:21.580
"In which case you are always making
an error, because you are never +1 or",01:15:21.580,01:15:24.190
"-1, when you should be.",01:15:24.190,01:15:25.830
"Or you could make it belong
to the +1 category or",01:15:25.830,01:15:28.230
to the -1 category.,01:15:28.230,01:15:29.700
"There are ramifications for
all of these decisions",01:15:29.700,01:15:32.190
that are purely technical.,01:15:32.190,01:15:33.950
Nothing conceptual comes out of them.,01:15:33.950,01:15:36.010
"That's why I decided not
to include it.",01:15:36.010,01:15:38.790
"Because it clutters the main concept
with something that really has no",01:15:38.790,01:15:42.220
ramification.,01:15:42.220,01:15:43.170
"As far as you're concerned, the easiest
way to consider it is that the",01:15:43.170,01:15:46.090
"output will be 0, and therefore you will
be making an error regardless of",01:15:46.090,01:15:49.040
whether it's +1 or -1.,01:15:49.040,01:15:50.410
"MODERATOR: Is there a kind of problem
that cannot be learned even if",01:15:53.600,01:15:57.070
there's a huge amount of data?,01:15:57.070,01:16:01.480
PROFESSOR: Correct.,01:16:01.480,01:16:02.360
"For example, if I go to my computer
and use a pseudo-random number",01:16:02.360,01:16:07.010
"generator to generate the target over
the entire domain, then patently,",01:16:07.010,01:16:12.090
"nothing I can give you will make
you learn the other guys.",01:16:12.090,01:16:14.960
So remember the three--,01:16:16.360,01:16:17.665
let me try to--,01:16:20.310,01:16:23.170
the essence of machine learning.,01:16:23.170,01:16:24.640
"The first one was, a pattern exists.",01:16:24.640,01:16:28.710
"If there's no pattern that exists,
there is nothing to learn.",01:16:29.510,01:16:34.130
"Let's say that it's like a baby,
and stuff is happening, and the",01:16:34.130,01:16:38.350
"baby is just staring. There is nothing
to pick from that thing.",01:16:38.350,01:16:42.000
"Once there is a pattern, you can see
the smile on the baby's face.",01:16:42.000,01:16:44.740
Now I can see what is going on.,01:16:44.740,01:16:46.500
"So whatever you are learning,
there needs to be a pattern.",01:16:46.500,01:16:49.420
"Now, how to tell that there's
a pattern or not,",01:16:50.240,01:16:52.640
that's a different question.,01:16:52.640,01:16:53.400
"But the main ingredient, there's a pattern.
The other one is we cannot pin",01:16:53.400,01:16:58.300
it down mathematically.,01:16:58.300,01:16:58.980
"If we can pin it down mathematically,
and you decide to do",01:16:58.980,01:17:00.970
"the learning, then you
are really lazy.",01:17:00.970,01:17:02.840
Because you could just write the code.,01:17:02.840,01:17:04.730
But fine.,01:17:04.730,01:17:05.380
"You can use learning in this case, but
it's not the recommended method,",01:17:05.380,01:17:08.280
"because it has certain errors
in performance.",01:17:08.280,01:17:11.620
"Whereas if you have the mathematical
definition, you just implement it and",01:17:11.620,01:17:14.060
you'll get the best possible solution.,01:17:14.060,01:17:16.150
"And the third one, you have data,
which is key.",01:17:16.150,01:17:18.240
"So you have plenty of data, but the
first one is off, you are simply not",01:17:18.240,01:17:22.370
going to learn.,01:17:22.370,01:17:23.890
"And it's not like I have to answer each
of these questions at random.",01:17:23.890,01:17:27.900
"The theory will completely
capture what is going on.",01:17:27.900,01:17:31.460
"So there's a very good reason for going
through four lectures in the",01:17:31.460,01:17:35.820
"outline that are
mathematically inclined.",01:17:35.820,01:17:38.490
This is not for the sake of math.,01:17:38.490,01:17:40.140
"I don't like to do math
hacking, if you will.",01:17:40.140,01:17:45.170
"I pick the math that is necessary
to establish a concept.",01:17:45.170,01:17:48.680
"And these will establish it, and they
are very much worth being patient with",01:17:48.680,01:17:51.530
and going through.,01:17:51.530,01:17:52.480
"Because once you're done with them, you
basically have it cold about what",01:17:52.480,01:17:55.840
"are the components that make learning
possible, and how do we tell, and all",01:17:55.840,01:18:00.520
of the questions that have been asked.,01:18:00.520,01:18:03.360
MODERATOR: Historical question.,01:18:03.360,01:18:04.620
"So why is the perceptron often
related with a neuron?",01:18:04.620,01:18:10.880
"PROFESSOR: I will discuss this
in neural networks, but in general,",01:18:10.880,01:18:14.435
"when you take a neuron and synapses, and
you find what is the function that",01:18:14.435,01:18:19.760
"gets to the neuron, you find that the
neuron fires, which is +1, if the",01:18:19.760,01:18:25.200
"signal coming to it, which is roughly
a combination of the stimuli, exceeds",01:18:25.200,01:18:31.090
a certain threshold.,01:18:31.090,01:18:32.400
"So that was the initial inspiration, and
the initial inspiration was",01:18:32.400,01:18:37.760
"that: the brain does a pretty good
job, so maybe if we mimic the",01:18:37.760,01:18:41.460
"function, we will get something good.",01:18:41.460,01:18:42.890
"But you mimic one neuron, and then you
put it together and you'll get the",01:18:42.890,01:18:45.940
"neural network that you
are talking about.",01:18:45.940,01:18:47.520
"And I will discuss the analogy with
biology, and the extent that it can be",01:18:47.520,01:18:52.780
"benefited from, when we talk
about neural networks, because",01:18:52.780,01:18:55.850
"that will be the more proper
context for that.",01:18:55.850,01:18:57.799
"MODERATOR: Another question is,
regarding the hypothesis set, are there",01:19:02.850,01:19:08.710
"Bayesian hierarchical procedures
to narrow down the hypothesis set?",01:19:08.710,01:19:12.645
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:19:15.660,01:19:16.916
"The choice of the hypothesis set and
the model in general is model",01:19:16.916,01:19:20.320
"selection, and there's quite a bit of
stuff that we are going to talk about",01:19:20.320,01:19:23.820
"in model selection, when we
talk about validation.",01:19:23.820,01:19:26.550
"In general, the word Bayesian was
mentioned here-- if you",01:19:26.550,01:19:31.160
"look at machine learning, there are
schools that deal with the subject",01:19:31.160,01:19:36.330
differently.,01:19:36.330,01:19:37.840
"So for example, the Bayesian school
puts a mathematical framework",01:19:37.840,01:19:41.940
completely on it.,01:19:41.940,01:19:43.160
"And then everything can be derived,
and that is based on Bayesian",01:19:43.160,01:19:47.490
principles.,01:19:47.490,01:19:48.500
"I will talk about that at the very
end, so it's last but not least.",01:19:48.500,01:19:54.380
"And I will make a very specific point
about it, for what it's worth.",01:19:54.380,01:19:57.350
"But what I'm talking about in the course
in all of the details, are the",01:19:57.350,01:20:03.280
"most commonly useful methods
in practice.",01:20:03.280,01:20:08.310
That is my criterion for inclusion.,01:20:08.310,01:20:10.280
"So I will get to that
when we get there.",01:20:10.900,01:20:13.910
"In terms of a hierarchy,",01:20:13.910,01:20:16.080
"there are a number of hierarchical
methods.",01:20:16.080,01:20:19.160
"For example, structural risk
minimization is one of them.",01:20:19.160,01:20:23.360
"There are methods of hierarchies,
and the ramifications of it in",01:20:23.360,01:20:27.060
generalization.,01:20:27.060,01:20:27.910
"I may touch upon it, when I get
to support vector machines.",01:20:27.910,01:20:30.500
"But again, there's a lot of theory,
and if you read a book on machine",01:20:30.500,01:20:35.490
"learning written by someone from pure
theory, you would think that you are",01:20:35.490,01:20:38.860
"reading about a completely
different subject.",01:20:38.860,01:20:41.220
"It's respectable stuff, but
different from the other",01:20:41.220,01:20:44.370
stuff that is practiced.,01:20:44.370,01:20:45.670
"So one of the things that I'm trying to
do, I'm trying to pick from all the",01:20:45.670,01:20:51.950
"components of machine learning, the
big picture that gives you the",01:20:51.950,01:20:56.070
"understanding of the concept, and
the tools to use it in practice.",01:20:56.070,01:20:59.540
That is the criterion for inclusion.,01:20:59.540,01:21:00.790
Any questions from the inside here?,01:21:04.710,01:21:07.340
"OK, we'll call it a day, and
we'll see you on Thursday.",01:21:11.060,01:21:13.040
