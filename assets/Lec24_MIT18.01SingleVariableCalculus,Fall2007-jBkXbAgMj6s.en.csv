want to get started",00:00:21.970,00:00:25.330
"by correcting a mistake
that I made last time.",00:00:25.330,00:00:30.340
"And this was
mistaken terminology.",00:00:30.340,00:00:37.410
"I said that what
we were computing,",00:00:37.410,00:00:41.290
"when we computed in
this candy bar example,",00:00:41.290,00:00:44.480
was energy and not heat.,00:00:44.480,00:00:47.510
But it's both.,00:00:47.510,00:00:49.270
They're the same thing.,00:00:49.270,00:00:51.010
"And in fact, energy,
heat and work",00:00:51.010,00:00:55.320
"are all the same
thing in physics.",00:00:55.320,00:00:59.470
"I was foolishly
considering the much more",00:00:59.470,00:01:03.895
"- what am I trying to say -
the intuitive feeling of heat",00:01:03.895,00:01:08.350
"as just being the
same as temperature.",00:01:08.350,00:01:10.720

heat is measured in calories",00:01:10.720,00:01:17.890
"and energy can be
in lots of things.",00:01:17.890,00:01:20.480
"Maybe kilowatt-hours or ergs,
these are various of the units.",00:01:20.480,00:01:26.610
"And work would be in
things like foot-pounds.",00:01:26.610,00:01:31.840
"That is, lifting some
weight some distance.",00:01:31.840,00:01:35.500
"And the amount of force
you have to apply.",00:01:35.500,00:01:39.240
"And these all have
conversions between them.",00:01:39.240,00:01:42.070
"They're all the same
quantity, in different units.",00:01:42.070,00:01:45.880
"OK, so these are
the same quantity.",00:01:45.880,00:01:54.030
Different units.,00:01:54.030,00:02:00.850
"So that's about as much
physics as we'll do for today.",00:02:00.850,00:02:08.850
And sorry about that.,00:02:08.850,00:02:11.290
"Now, the example that I was
starting to discuss last time",00:02:11.290,00:02:18.800
"and that I'm going
to carry out today",00:02:18.800,00:02:21.980
was this dartboard example.,00:02:21.980,00:02:32.390
"We have a dartboard, which
is some kind of target.",00:02:32.390,00:02:40.160
"And we have a person,
your little brother,",00:02:40.160,00:02:46.380
who's standing over there.,00:02:46.380,00:02:48.540
And somebody is throwing darts.,00:02:48.540,00:02:50.680
"And the question is, how
likely is he to be hit.",00:02:50.680,00:02:55.790
"So I want to describe
to you how we're",00:02:55.790,00:02:59.950
"going to make this problem
into a math problem.",00:02:59.950,00:03:02.550
Yep.,00:03:02.550,00:03:03.050
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:03:03.050,00:03:03.904
"PROFESSOR: What topic is
this that we're going over.",00:03:03.904,00:03:06.070
We're going over an example.,00:03:06.070,00:03:08.250
Which is a dartboard example.,00:03:08.250,00:03:11.650
"And it has to do
with probability.",00:03:11.650,00:03:16.090
OK.,00:03:16.090,00:03:17.370
"So what is the probability that
this guy, your little brother,",00:03:17.370,00:03:38.260
gets hit by a dart.,00:03:38.260,00:03:47.700
"Now, we have to put some
assumptions into this problem",00:03:47.700,00:03:52.020
"in order to make
it a math problem.",00:03:52.020,00:03:53.630
"And I'm really going
to try to make them",00:03:53.630,00:03:55.940
pretty realistic assumptions.,00:03:55.940,00:03:58.630
"So the first assumption is
that the number of hits is",00:03:58.630,00:04:09.580
"proportional to some
constant times e^(-r^2).",00:04:09.580,00:04:21.520
"So that's actually a kind
of a normal distribution.",00:04:24.430,00:04:27.910
That's the bell curve.,00:04:27.910,00:04:30.560
But as a function of the radius.,00:04:30.560,00:04:34.250
"So this is the
assumption that I'm",00:04:34.250,00:04:37.060
going to make in this problem.,00:04:37.060,00:04:39.990
"And a problem in
probability is a problem",00:04:39.990,00:04:44.970
"of the ratio of the
part to the whole.",00:04:44.970,00:04:48.540
"So the part is where this
little guy is standing.",00:04:48.540,00:04:53.580
"And the whole is all
the possible places",00:04:53.580,00:04:56.670
where the dart might hit.,00:04:56.670,00:04:58.232
"Which is maybe the
whole blackboard",00:04:58.232,00:04:59.690
"or extending beyond,
depending on how good an aim",00:04:59.690,00:05:02.670
"you think that this
older child has.",00:05:02.670,00:05:07.780
"So, if you like, the part
is-- We'll start simply.",00:05:07.780,00:05:11.730
"I mean, this doesn't
sweep all the way around.",00:05:11.730,00:05:14.290
"But we're going to talk
about some section.",00:05:14.290,00:05:17.170
Like this.,00:05:17.170,00:05:18.930
"Where this is some radius
r_1, and this other radius",00:05:18.930,00:05:22.400
"is some longer radius, r_2.",00:05:22.400,00:05:24.460
"And the part that we'll
first keep track of",00:05:24.460,00:05:27.830
is everything around there.,00:05:27.830,00:05:29.470
"That's not very well
centered, but it's supposed",00:05:29.470,00:05:31.470
to be two concentric circles.,00:05:31.470,00:05:35.060
"Maybe I should fix that a bit
so that it's a little bit easier",00:05:35.060,00:05:38.840
to read here.,00:05:38.840,00:05:39.784
So here we go.,00:05:39.784,00:05:41.260
"So here I have radius r_1,
and here I have radius r_2.",00:05:41.260,00:05:46.700
"And then the region in
between is what we're",00:05:46.700,00:05:49.610
going to try to keep track of.,00:05:49.610,00:05:56.050
"So I claim that we'll
be able to get--",00:05:56.050,00:05:59.170
"So this is what I'm calling
the part, to start out with.",00:05:59.170,00:06:04.100
"And then we'll take
a section of it",00:06:04.100,00:06:05.570
"to get the place where
the person is standing.",00:06:05.570,00:06:12.220
"Now, I want to take a
side view of e^(-r^2).",00:06:12.220,00:06:22.157
"The function that
we're talking about.",00:06:22.157,00:06:23.740
"Again, that's the bell curve.",00:06:23.740,00:06:28.650
And it sort of looks like this.,00:06:28.650,00:06:31.900
"This is the top value,
this is now the r-axis.",00:06:31.900,00:06:36.090
"And this is up, or
at least-- So you",00:06:36.090,00:06:39.490
"should think of this
in terms of the fact",00:06:39.490,00:06:41.540
"that the horizontal here is
the plane of the dartboard.",00:06:41.540,00:06:46.900
"And the vertical is
measuring how likely",00:06:46.900,00:06:49.390
"it is that there will
be darts piling up here.",00:06:49.390,00:06:52.460
"So if they were
balls tumbling down",00:06:52.460,00:06:55.780
"or something else
falling on, many of them",00:06:55.780,00:06:57.690
would pile up here.,00:06:57.690,00:06:58.530
"Many fewer of them would
be piling up farther away.",00:06:58.530,00:07:02.890
"And the chunk that
we're keeping track of",00:07:02.890,00:07:06.430
"is the chunk
between r_1 and r_2.",00:07:06.430,00:07:09.200
"That's the corresponding
region here.",00:07:09.200,00:07:11.590
"And in order to
calculate this part,",00:07:11.590,00:07:14.180
"we have to calculate this
volume of revolution.",00:07:14.180,00:07:20.500
Sweeping around.,00:07:20.500,00:07:21.350
"Because really, in
disguise, this is a ring.",00:07:21.350,00:07:24.160
"This is a side view,
it's really a ring.",00:07:24.160,00:07:26.480
"Because we're rotating
it around this axis here.",00:07:26.480,00:07:33.100
"So we're trying
to figure out what",00:07:33.100,00:07:34.990
"the total volume
of that ring is.",00:07:34.990,00:07:36.800
"And that's going to be our
weighting, our likelihood",00:07:36.800,00:07:39.930
"for whether the
hits are occurring",00:07:39.930,00:07:41.390
"in this section, or in
this ring, versus the rest.",00:07:41.390,00:07:51.240
"To set this up, I
remind you we're going",00:07:51.240,00:07:53.750
to use the method of shells.,00:07:53.750,00:07:57.570
"That's really the only one
that's going to work here.",00:07:57.570,00:08:03.030
"And we want to integrate
between r_1 and r_2.",00:08:03.030,00:08:07.990
"And the range here is that--
Because this is, if you like,",00:08:07.990,00:08:12.280
a solid of revolution.,00:08:12.280,00:08:13.470
"So the variable r is the same
as what we used to call x.",00:08:13.470,00:08:17.250
"And it's ranging
between r_1 and r_2,",00:08:17.250,00:08:18.924
"and then we're
sweeping it around.",00:08:18.924,00:08:20.340
"And the circumference
of a little piece,",00:08:20.340,00:08:25.920
"so at a fixed distance r
here, the circumference",00:08:25.920,00:08:35.040
is going to be 2 pi r.,00:08:35.040,00:08:37.950
So 2 pi r is the circumference.,00:08:37.950,00:08:40.240
"And then the height is the
height of that green stem",00:08:40.240,00:08:42.710
there.,00:08:42.710,00:08:43.210
That's e^(-r^2).,00:08:43.210,00:08:45.460
"And then we're multiplying by
the thickness, which is dr.",00:08:45.460,00:08:50.460
"So the thickness
of the green is dr.",00:08:50.460,00:08:52.530
"The height of this little
green guy is e^(-r^2),",00:08:52.530,00:08:57.860
"and the circumference is
2 pi times the radius,",00:08:57.860,00:09:01.310
when we sweep the circle around.,00:09:01.310,00:09:03.701
Question.,00:09:03.701,00:09:04.200
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:09:04.200,00:09:21.970
"PROFESSOR: So the
question is, why",00:09:21.970,00:09:23.850
"is what we're interested
in not this pink area.",00:09:23.850,00:09:28.020
"And the reason is
an interpretation",00:09:28.020,00:09:31.810
of what I meant by this.,00:09:31.810,00:09:33.430
"What I meant by this is
that if you wanted to add up",00:09:33.430,00:09:38.310
"what the likelihood is that this
thing will be here versus here,",00:09:38.310,00:09:42.190
"I want it to be,
really, the proportions",00:09:42.190,00:09:44.940
"are the number of hits
times the, if you like,",00:09:44.940,00:09:47.780
I wanted it d area.,00:09:47.780,00:09:49.590
That's really what I meant here.,00:09:49.590,00:09:51.850
"The number of hits
in a little chunk.",00:09:51.850,00:09:56.740
"So little, maybe I'll call
it delta A. A little chunk.",00:09:56.740,00:10:01.370
"Is proportional to
the chunk times that.",00:10:01.370,00:10:04.480
"So there's already
an area factor.",00:10:04.480,00:10:05.920
And there's a height.,00:10:05.920,00:10:06.920
"So there are a total of
three dimensions involved.",00:10:06.920,00:10:09.580
"There's the area and
then this height.",00:10:09.580,00:10:13.120
"So it's a matter of the--
what I was given, what I",00:10:13.120,00:10:18.640
intended to say the problem is.,00:10:18.640,00:10:21.720
"Yeah, another question.",00:10:21.720,00:10:22.720
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:10:22.720,00:10:25.084
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.",00:10:25.084,00:10:26.000
Exactly.,00:10:26.000,00:10:27.060
"The height is c times
that, whatever this c is.",00:10:27.060,00:10:30.570
"In fact, we don't
know what the c is,",00:10:30.570,00:10:32.220
"but because we're going to
have a part and a whole,",00:10:32.220,00:10:34.460
"we'll divide, the c
will always cancel.",00:10:34.460,00:10:37.490
So I'm throwing the c out.,00:10:37.490,00:10:39.240
"I don't know what it is, and
in the end it won't matter.",00:10:39.240,00:10:42.750
"That's a very
important question.",00:10:42.750,00:10:44.330
Yes.,00:10:44.330,00:10:44.830
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:10:44.830,00:10:49.180
PROFESSOR: Say it again?,00:10:49.180,00:10:50.180
STUDENT: PROFESSOR:,00:10:50.180,00:11:02.040
"PROFESSOR: So what I mean is the
number of hits in some chunk.",00:11:02.040,00:11:05.920
"That is, suppose you
imagine, the question",00:11:05.920,00:11:09.520
"is, what does this
left-hand side mean.",00:11:09.520,00:11:11.720
That right?,00:11:11.720,00:11:12.250
"Is that the question
that's you're asking?",00:11:12.250,00:11:17.690
"When I try to understand
what the distribution",00:11:17.690,00:11:21.040
"of dartboard hits is, I
should imagine my dartboard.",00:11:21.040,00:11:25.420
"And very often there'll
be a whole bunch",00:11:25.420,00:11:28.400
of holes in some places.,00:11:28.400,00:11:29.700
And fewer holes else.,00:11:29.700,00:11:30.810
"I'm trying to figure out
what the whole distribution",00:11:30.810,00:11:33.010
of those marks is.,00:11:33.010,00:11:35.590
"And so some places will
have more hits on them",00:11:35.590,00:11:38.410
"and some places will
have fewer hits on them.",00:11:38.410,00:11:41.060
"And so what I want to
measure is, on average,",00:11:41.060,00:11:43.980
the number of hits.,00:11:43.980,00:11:44.910
"So this would really
be some-- This constant",00:11:44.910,00:11:47.387
"of proportionality is
ambiguous because it depends",00:11:47.387,00:11:49.470
on how many times you try.,00:11:49.470,00:11:50.553
"If you throw a
thousand times, it'll",00:11:50.553,00:11:52.470
be much more densely packed.,00:11:52.470,00:11:54.320
"And if you have only a
hundred times it'll be fewer.",00:11:54.320,00:11:58.780
"So that's where this
constant comes in.",00:11:58.780,00:12:01.850
"But given that you have
a certain number of times",00:12:01.850,00:12:04.610
"that you tried, say,
a thousand times,",00:12:04.610,00:12:06.790
"there will be a whole bunch
more piled in the middle.",00:12:06.790,00:12:09.500
"And fewer and fewer as
you get farther away.",00:12:09.500,00:12:12.020
"Assuming that the person's
aim is reasonable.",00:12:12.020,00:12:15.800
So that's what we're saying.,00:12:15.800,00:12:17.024
"So we're thinking in terms
of-- The person's always aiming",00:12:17.024,00:12:19.440
for the center.,00:12:19.440,00:12:20.065
"So it's most likely that the
person will hit the center.",00:12:20.065,00:12:22.660
"But on the other hand,
it's a fallible person,",00:12:22.660,00:12:24.820
so the person may miss.,00:12:24.820,00:12:26.440
"And so it's less and less
likely as you go farther out.",00:12:26.440,00:12:29.272
"And we're just counting how
many times this gets hit,",00:12:29.272,00:12:31.480
how many time this and so on.,00:12:31.480,00:12:33.220
In proportion to the area.,00:12:33.220,00:12:34.830
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:12:34.830,00:12:40.460
"PROFESSOR: Yeah. r_1
and r_2 are arbitrary.",00:12:40.460,00:12:42.252
"We're going to make this
calculation in general.",00:12:42.252,00:12:44.251
"We're going to calculate
what the likelihood is",00:12:44.251,00:12:46.240
that we hit any possible band.,00:12:46.240,00:12:50.290
"And I want to leave those
as just letters for now.",00:12:50.290,00:12:53.010
The r_1 and the r_2.,00:12:53.010,00:12:54.990
"Because I want to be able
to try various different",00:12:54.990,00:12:57.110
possibilities.,00:12:57.110,00:12:57.990
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:12:57.990,00:13:03.730
"PROFESSOR: Say it again, why
do we have to take volume?",00:13:03.730,00:13:06.310
"So this is what we
were addressing before.",00:13:06.310,00:13:08.830
"It's a volume because it's
number of hit per unit area.",00:13:08.830,00:13:13.900
"So there's a height,
that is, number of hits.",00:13:13.900,00:13:17.590
"And then there's an area
and the product of those",00:13:17.590,00:13:19.820
"is-- So this is, if
you like, a histogram",00:13:19.820,00:13:22.610
of the number of hits.,00:13:22.610,00:13:25.100
"But this should be
measured per area.",00:13:25.100,00:13:26.910
Not per length of r.,00:13:26.910,00:13:29.400
"Because on the real diagram,
it's going all the way around.",00:13:29.400,00:13:32.020
"There's a lot more
area to this red band",00:13:32.020,00:13:35.760
than just the distance implies.,00:13:35.760,00:13:41.150
OK.,00:13:41.150,00:13:42.940
"So, having discussed
the setup, this",00:13:42.940,00:13:47.460
"is a pretty standard setup--
Oh, one more question.",00:13:47.460,00:13:49.770
Yes.,00:13:49.770,00:13:50.270
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:13:50.270,00:14:13.564
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:14:13.564,00:14:14.230
"So the question is, why
is this a realistic.",00:14:14.230,00:14:17.700
"Why is this choice of
function here, e^(-r^2),",00:14:17.700,00:14:21.260
"a realistic choice of
function for the darts.",00:14:21.260,00:14:25.670
"So I can answer this
with an analogy.",00:14:25.670,00:14:30.480
"When people were
asking themselves",00:14:30.480,00:14:32.800
"where the V-2 rockets
from Germany hit London,",00:14:32.800,00:14:38.120
they used this model.,00:14:38.120,00:14:39.170
"It turned out to be the one
which was the most accurate.",00:14:39.170,00:14:43.100
"So that gives you an idea
that this is actually real.",00:14:43.100,00:14:48.630
"The question, this makes it
look like people are masters.",00:14:48.630,00:14:53.670
"That is, that they'll
all hit in the center",00:14:53.670,00:14:56.940
more often than elsewhere.,00:14:56.940,00:14:58.870
"But that's actually
somewhat deceptive.",00:14:58.870,00:15:03.960
"There's a difference
between the mode,",00:15:03.960,00:15:08.040
"that is, the most likely spot,
and what happens on average.",00:15:08.040,00:15:13.510
"So in other words, the single
most likely spot is the center.",00:15:13.510,00:15:17.960
"But there's rather little
area in here, and in fact",00:15:17.960,00:15:20.720
"the likelihood of hitting
that is some little tiny bit.",00:15:20.720,00:15:24.860
In here.,00:15:24.860,00:15:25.620
"In fact, you're much more
likely to be out here.",00:15:25.620,00:15:29.850
"So if you take the
total of the volume,",00:15:29.850,00:15:31.539
"you'll see that
much of the volume",00:15:31.539,00:15:32.955
is contributed from out here.,00:15:32.955,00:15:34.260
"And in fact, the person hits
rather rarely near the center.",00:15:34.260,00:15:37.780
"So this is not a
ridiculous thing to do.",00:15:37.780,00:15:42.737
"If you think of it in terms of
somebody's aiming at the center",00:15:42.737,00:15:45.320
"but there's some
random thing which",00:15:45.320,00:15:46.950
"is throwing the
person off, then there",00:15:46.950,00:15:49.770
"is likely to be to
left or to the right,",00:15:49.770,00:15:51.710
"or they might even get
lucky and all those errors",00:15:51.710,00:15:54.080
"cancel themselves
and they happen",00:15:54.080,00:15:55.470
"to hit pretty much
near the center.",00:15:55.470,00:15:59.090
"Yeah, another question.",00:15:59.090,00:16:00.240
"STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR:
How does the little brother",00:16:00.240,00:16:06.266
come into play?,00:16:06.266,00:16:06.890
"The little brother is going
to come into play as follows.",00:16:06.890,00:16:09.390
I'll tell you in advance.,00:16:09.390,00:16:11.300
"So the thing is, the little
brother was not so stupid",00:16:11.300,00:16:15.500
"as to stand in
front of the target.",00:16:15.500,00:16:19.760
I know.,00:16:19.760,00:16:22.220
"He stood about twice the
radius of the target away.",00:16:22.220,00:16:26.800
"And so, we're going to
approximate the location",00:16:26.800,00:16:29.960
by some sector here.,00:16:29.960,00:16:32.460
"Which is just going to be some
chunk of one of these things.",00:16:32.460,00:16:35.920
"We'll just break
off a piece of it.",00:16:35.920,00:16:38.010
"And that's how we're
going to capture.",00:16:38.010,00:16:39.850
"So the point is,
the target is here.",00:16:39.850,00:16:42.030
"But there is the possibility
that the seven-year-old",00:16:42.030,00:16:46.000
"who's throwing the darts
actually missed the target.",00:16:46.000,00:16:48.550
That actually happens a lot.,00:16:48.550,00:16:50.780
"So, does that answer
your question?",00:16:50.780,00:16:54.660
Alright.,00:16:54.660,00:16:55.530
Are we ready now to to do this?,00:16:55.530,00:16:57.170
One more question.,00:16:57.170,00:16:57.950
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:16:57.950,00:17:05.250
"PROFESSOR: I'm giving
you this property here.",00:17:05.250,00:17:08.320
"I'm telling you
that-- This is what's",00:17:08.320,00:17:10.110
"called a mathematical
model, when you give",00:17:10.110,00:17:12.540
somebody something like this.,00:17:12.540,00:17:13.900
"In fact, that requires
further justification.",00:17:13.900,00:17:16.450
It's an interesting issue.,00:17:16.450,00:17:19.120
Yeah.,00:17:19.120,00:17:19.620
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:17:19.620,00:17:26.084
"PROFESSOR: I'm giving
it to you for now.",00:17:26.084,00:17:27.750
"And it's something which
really has to be justified.",00:17:27.750,00:17:30.120
"In certain circumstances
it is justified.",00:17:30.120,00:17:32.080
"But, OK.",00:17:32.080,00:17:37.620
"So anyway, here's our part.",00:17:37.620,00:17:43.800
"This is going to be
our chunk, for now,",00:17:43.800,00:17:46.200
"that we're going to
estimate the importance,",00:17:46.200,00:17:50.760
"the relative importance, of.",00:17:50.760,00:17:56.210
"And now, this is something whose
antiderivative we can just do",00:17:56.210,00:18:01.460
by substitution or by guessing.,00:18:01.460,00:18:03.600
It's just -pi e^(-r^2).,00:18:03.600,00:18:07.870
"If you differentiate
that, you get a -2r, which",00:18:07.870,00:18:10.650
cancels the minus sign here.,00:18:10.650,00:18:12.730
So you get 2pi r e^(-r^2).,00:18:12.730,00:18:15.370
So that's the antiderivative.,00:18:15.370,00:18:18.400
"And we're evaluating
it at r_1 and r_2.",00:18:18.400,00:18:24.710
"So with the minus sign
that's going to get reversed.",00:18:24.710,00:18:28.490
"The answer is going to
be pi times e^(-r_1^2),",00:18:28.490,00:18:33.350
"that's the bottom one, minus
e^(r_2^2), that's the top.",00:18:33.350,00:18:39.090
"So this is what
our part gives us.",00:18:39.090,00:18:45.777
"And, more technically, if you
wanted to multiply through",00:18:45.777,00:18:48.110
"by c, it would be c times this.",00:18:48.110,00:18:50.350
I'll say that in just a second.,00:18:50.350,00:18:55.140
"OK, now I want to
work-- So, if you like,",00:18:55.140,00:18:59.280
"the part is equal to, maybe
even I'll call it c pi,",00:18:59.280,00:19:06.490
times e^(-r_1^2) - e^(-r_2^2).,00:19:06.490,00:19:07.740
"That's what it really is
if I put in this factor.",00:19:12.429,00:19:14.470
"So now there's no prejudice as
to how many attempts we make.",00:19:14.470,00:19:17.690
"Whether it was a thousand
attempts or a million",00:19:17.690,00:19:20.490
attempts at the target.,00:19:20.490,00:19:22.740
"Now, the most important
second feature",00:19:22.740,00:19:25.480
"here of these kinds
of modeling problems",00:19:25.480,00:19:27.250
"is, there is always some
kind of idealization.",00:19:27.250,00:19:30.560
"And the next thing that I
want to discuss with you",00:19:30.560,00:19:33.070
"is the interpretation
of the whole.",00:19:33.070,00:19:36.940
"That is, what's the family
of all possibilities.",00:19:36.940,00:19:41.870
"And in this case, what
I'm going to claim",00:19:41.870,00:19:45.790
"is that the reasonable
way to think of the whole",00:19:45.790,00:19:50.160
"is it's that r can range all
the way from 0 to infinity.",00:19:50.160,00:19:55.940
"Now, you may not like this.",00:19:55.940,00:19:57.210
"But these are maybe my first
and third favorite number,",00:19:57.210,00:20:01.730
"my second favorite
number being 1.",00:20:01.730,00:20:03.810
"So infinity is a
really useful concept.",00:20:03.810,00:20:07.930
"Of course, it's nonsense in
the context of the darts.",00:20:07.930,00:20:12.010
"Because if you think
of the basement wall",00:20:12.010,00:20:14.770
"where the kid might
miss a target,",00:20:14.770,00:20:17.140
he'd probably hit the wall.,00:20:17.140,00:20:19.619
"He's probably not going to hit
one of the walls to the right,",00:20:19.619,00:20:22.160
"and anyway he's certainly
not going to hit over there.",00:20:22.160,00:20:25.080
"So there's something
artificial about sending",00:20:25.080,00:20:28.870
"the possibility of hits all
the way out to infinity.",00:20:28.870,00:20:32.390
"On the other hand, the
shape of this curve",00:20:32.390,00:20:34.850
"is such that the
real tail ends here,",00:20:34.850,00:20:38.310
"because of this exponential
decrease, are tiny.",00:20:38.310,00:20:40.990
And that's negligible.,00:20:40.990,00:20:42.630
"And the point is that
actually the value,",00:20:42.630,00:20:45.700
"if you go all the
way out to infinity,",00:20:45.700,00:20:47.550
"is the easiest
value to calculate.",00:20:47.550,00:20:50.020
"So by doing this, I'm
idealizing the problem",00:20:50.020,00:20:52.697
"but I'm actually making
the numbers come out",00:20:52.697,00:20:54.530
much more cleanly.,00:20:54.530,00:20:55.890
"And this is just always
done in mathematics.",00:20:55.890,00:20:58.180
"That's what we did when
we went from differences",00:20:58.180,00:21:00.290
"to differentials,
to differentiation",00:21:00.290,00:21:02.460
and infinitesimals.,00:21:02.460,00:21:04.640
So we like that.,00:21:04.640,00:21:06.282
"Because it makes things easier,
not because it makes things",00:21:06.282,00:21:08.740
harder.,00:21:08.740,00:21:10.320
"So we're just going to
pretend the whole is",00:21:10.320,00:21:12.240
from 0 to infinity.,00:21:12.240,00:21:13.450
"And now let's just
see what it is.",00:21:13.450,00:21:15.550
"It's c pi times, the
starting place is e^(-0^2).",00:21:15.550,00:21:21.330
"That's r_1, right, this is the
role that r_1 plays is this,",00:21:21.330,00:21:24.630
and the r_2 is this value.,00:21:24.630,00:21:26.374
Minus e^(-infinity^2).,00:21:26.374,00:21:27.290
"Which is that negligibly
small number, 0.",00:21:30.180,00:21:33.940
So this is just c pi.,00:21:33.940,00:21:36.750
"Because this number is 1,
and this other number is 0.",00:21:36.750,00:21:39.700
"This is just (1 - 0), in
the parentheses there.",00:21:39.700,00:21:48.420
"And now I can tell you
from these two numbers",00:21:48.420,00:21:52.300
what the probability is.,00:21:52.300,00:21:54.990
"The probability that
we landed on the target",00:21:54.990,00:21:58.450
"in a radius between r_1 and r_2,
so that's this annulus here,",00:21:58.450,00:22:04.250
"is the ratio of the
part to the whole.",00:22:04.250,00:22:12.350
"Which in this case
just cancels the c pi.",00:22:12.350,00:22:16.060
So it's e^(-r_1^2) - e^(-r_2^2).,00:22:16.060,00:22:21.280
"There's the formula
for the probability.",00:22:21.280,00:22:25.520
"So the c canceled
and the pi canceled.",00:22:25.520,00:22:28.100
It's all gone.,00:22:28.100,00:22:32.170
"Now, again, let
me just emphasize",00:22:32.170,00:22:34.040
"the way this formula
is supposed to work.",00:22:34.040,00:22:35.750
"The total probability
of every possibility",00:22:35.750,00:22:42.210
"here is supposed to
be set up to be 1.",00:22:42.210,00:22:45.900
This is some fraction of 1.,00:22:45.900,00:22:48.530
"If you like, it's a percent.",00:22:48.530,00:22:51.191
Yes.,00:22:51.191,00:22:51.690
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:22:51.690,00:22:57.149
"PROFESSOR: This one is giving--
The question is, doesn't this",00:22:57.149,00:22:59.690
"just give the
probability of the ring?",00:22:59.690,00:23:00.780
"This gives you the
probability of the ring,",00:23:00.780,00:23:02.620
"but this is a very,
very wide ring.",00:23:02.620,00:23:05.510
"This is a ring starting with
0, nothing, on the inside.",00:23:05.510,00:23:08.479
And then going all the way out.,00:23:08.479,00:23:09.770
So that's everything.,00:23:09.770,00:23:11.880
"So this corresponds
to everything.",00:23:11.880,00:23:13.380
This corresponds to a ring.,00:23:13.380,00:23:22.650
"So now, let's see.",00:23:22.650,00:23:24.990
Where do I want to go from here.,00:23:24.990,00:23:26.390

make progress here,",00:23:26.390,00:23:28.550
"I still have to give you one
more piece of information.",00:23:28.550,00:23:31.230

supposed to be realistic.",00:23:31.230,00:23:35.650
"When I was three years old
and my brother's friend Ralph",00:23:35.650,00:23:40.350

a little better at it.",00:23:54.200,00:23:57.080
"But Ralph at age seven,
the probability that he",00:23:57.080,00:23:59.950
hit the target was about 1/2.,00:23:59.950,00:24:08.440
Right?,00:24:08.440,00:24:09.660
"So he hit the target
about half the time.",00:24:09.660,00:24:12.040
"And the other times,
there was cement",00:24:12.040,00:24:14.560
"on the walls of the
basement, it wasn't that bad.",00:24:14.560,00:24:17.870
Just bounced off.,00:24:17.870,00:24:19.250
"That also meant that the points
got a little blunter as time",00:24:19.250,00:24:22.000
went on.,00:24:22.000,00:24:22.560
"So it was a little less
dangerous when they hit.",00:24:22.560,00:24:26.150
Alright.,00:24:26.150,00:24:26.650
"So now, so here's the extra
assumption that I want to make.",00:24:26.650,00:24:33.210
"So a is going to be the
radius of the target.",00:24:33.210,00:24:41.260
"Now, the other realistic
assumption that I want to make",00:24:41.260,00:24:45.660
"is where this little
kid would be standing.",00:24:45.660,00:24:49.170
"And now, here, I want
to get very specific",00:24:49.170,00:24:51.650
"and just do the
computation in one case.",00:24:51.650,00:24:54.280
"We're going to imagine
the target is here.",00:24:54.280,00:25:00.430
"And the kid is standing,
say, between-- So we'll just",00:25:00.430,00:25:03.200
do a section of this.,00:25:03.200,00:25:04.430
"This is between 3
o'clock and 5 o'clock.",00:25:04.430,00:25:13.130
"There's more of him, but it's
lower down and maybe negligible",00:25:13.130,00:25:16.740
here.,00:25:16.740,00:25:17.350
"So this section is
the part, the chunk",00:25:17.350,00:25:20.400
that we want to see about.,00:25:20.400,00:25:23.330
"And this is a, and then
this distance here is 2a.",00:25:23.330,00:25:31.210
"And then the longest
distance here is 3a.",00:25:31.210,00:25:35.330
So the longest distance is 3a.,00:25:35.330,00:25:39.000
"So in other words,
what I'm saying",00:25:39.000,00:25:40.870
"is that the probability, if
you're standing too close,",00:25:40.870,00:25:50.180
"the chance Ralph hits younger
brother is about 1/6-- Right?",00:25:50.180,00:26:06.660
Because 2/12 = 1/6.,00:26:06.660,00:26:12.820
"1/6 of the probability that
we're between a and 3a.",00:26:12.820,00:26:22.020
"That's the number that
we're looking for.",00:26:22.020,00:26:29.052
Another question.,00:26:29.052,00:26:29.760
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:26:29.760,00:26:33.900
"PROFESSOR: The 2/12 came from
the fact that we assumed.",00:26:33.900,00:26:36.680
"So we made a very, very
bold assumption here.",00:26:36.680,00:26:39.250
"We assumed that
this human being,",00:26:39.250,00:26:41.530
"who is actually standing--
The floor is about down here.",00:26:41.530,00:26:46.760
Maybe he wasn't that tall.,00:26:46.760,00:26:48.460
"But anyway, so he's really
a little bigger than this.",00:26:48.460,00:26:51.560
"That the part of him that
was close to the target",00:26:51.560,00:26:53.850
"covered about this section
here, between radius 2a and 3a.",00:26:53.850,00:27:00.500
"As you'll see, actually
from the computation,",00:27:00.500,00:27:02.740
"because the likelihood drops
off pretty quickly, whatever",00:27:02.740,00:27:07.290
"of him was standing
outside there",00:27:07.290,00:27:09.140
wouldn't have mattered anyway.,00:27:09.140,00:27:11.269
"So we're just worried
about the part that's",00:27:11.269,00:27:13.060
closest to the target here.,00:27:13.060,00:27:18.677
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:27:18.677,00:27:19.510
PROFESSOR: Why is it out of 12?,00:27:19.510,00:27:20.801
Because I made it a clock.,00:27:20.801,00:27:22.650
"And I made it from 3
o'clock to 5 o'clock,",00:27:22.650,00:27:25.110
"so it's 2 of the 12
hours of a clock.",00:27:25.110,00:27:28.790
"It's just a way of me making
a section that you can visibly",00:27:28.790,00:27:32.640
see.,00:27:32.640,00:27:36.400
"So now, so here's what
we're trying to calculate.",00:27:36.400,00:27:40.060
"And in order to figure this
out, I need one more item. here.",00:27:40.060,00:27:47.790
"So maybe I'll leave myself
a little bit of room.",00:27:47.790,00:27:49.870
"I have to figure out
something about what",00:27:49.870,00:27:52.010
our information gave us.,00:27:52.010,00:27:53.830
"Which is that the probability,
sorry, this probability",00:27:53.830,00:28:00.380
was 1/2.,00:28:00.380,00:28:01.690
So let's remember what this is.,00:28:01.690,00:28:03.580
"This is going to be
e^(-0^2) - e^(-a^2).",00:28:03.580,00:28:09.470
"That's what's this
probability is.",00:28:09.470,00:28:11.180
And that's equal to 1/2.,00:28:11.180,00:28:16.210
"So that means that -
1 - e^(-a^2). = 1/2.",00:28:16.210,00:28:21.330
Which means that e^(-a^2) = 1/2.,00:28:21.330,00:28:26.620
"I'm not going to
calculate a, this",00:28:26.620,00:28:28.220
"is the part about the
information about a",00:28:28.220,00:28:30.050
that I want to use.,00:28:30.050,00:28:32.480
That's what I'll use.,00:28:32.480,00:28:33.520
"And now I'm going to calculate
this other probability here.",00:28:33.520,00:28:36.250
"So the probability
right up there is this.",00:28:36.250,00:28:41.590
"And that's going to be the same
as e^(-(2a)^2) - e^(-(3a)^2).",00:28:41.590,00:28:47.390
That's what we calculated.,00:28:51.610,00:28:54.650
"And now I want to use some of
the arithmetic of exponents.",00:28:54.650,00:28:59.200
This is (e^(-a^2))^2.,00:28:59.200,00:29:01.380
"Because it's really (2a)^2
is 4-- the quantity is 4a^2,",00:29:05.180,00:29:11.890
"and then I bring
that exponent out.",00:29:11.890,00:29:14.580
"Minus e^(-a^2) to the
9th power, that's 3^2.",00:29:14.580,00:29:19.740
"And so this comes out
to be (1/2)^4 - (1/2)^9.",00:29:25.040,00:29:28.560
Which is approximately 1/16.,00:29:36.190,00:29:39.340
This is negligible.,00:29:39.340,00:29:40.380
This part here.,00:29:40.380,00:29:41.180
"And this is actually
why these tails,",00:29:41.180,00:29:43.110
"as you go out to infinity,
don't really matter that much.",00:29:43.110,00:29:48.130
"So this is a much
smaller number.",00:29:48.130,00:29:49.880
"So the probability of
the whole band is 1/16.",00:29:49.880,00:29:53.390
"And now I can answer
the question up here.",00:29:53.390,00:29:55.720
"This is approximately
1/6 * 1/16.",00:29:55.720,00:30:01.110
"Which is about
1/100, or about 1%.",00:30:01.110,00:30:07.340
"So if I stood there
for 100 attempts,",00:30:07.340,00:30:13.340
"then my chances of getting
hit were pretty high.",00:30:13.340,00:30:18.720
So that's the computation.,00:30:18.720,00:30:27.970
"That's a typical example of
a problem in probability.",00:30:27.970,00:30:34.940
"And let me just make
one more connection",00:30:34.940,00:30:36.860
with what we did before.,00:30:36.860,00:30:42.660
"This is connected to weighted
averages or integrals",00:30:42.660,00:30:46.130
over weights.,00:30:46.130,00:30:47.470
"But the weight that's
involved in this problem",00:30:47.470,00:30:53.110
"was w(r) is equal to-- So let's
just look at what happened",00:30:53.110,00:30:59.810
in all of those integrals.,00:30:59.810,00:31:01.520
"What happened in all
the integrals was, we",00:31:01.520,00:31:03.790
"had this factor here, 2 pi r.",00:31:03.790,00:31:09.060
"And if I include this c, it
was really 2 pi c r e^(-r^2).",00:31:09.060,00:31:23.330
"This was the weight
that we were using.",00:31:23.330,00:31:27.960
"The relative
importance of things.",00:31:27.960,00:31:30.770
"Now, this is not the same as
the e^(-r^2) that we started out",00:31:30.770,00:31:34.260
with.,00:31:34.260,00:31:34.760
"Because this is the
one-dimensional histogram.",00:31:34.760,00:31:38.000
"And that has to do with the
method of shells that gave us",00:31:38.000,00:31:40.850
that extra factor of r here.,00:31:40.850,00:31:43.210
"So that also connects
with the question",00:31:43.210,00:31:45.090
"at the beginning, which had
to do with this paradox,",00:31:45.090,00:31:47.610
"that it looks like these
places in the middle",00:31:47.610,00:31:50.420
are the most likely.,00:31:50.420,00:31:51.440
But that's the plot e^(-r^2).,00:31:51.440,00:31:54.500
"If you actually look
at this plot here,",00:31:54.500,00:31:57.240
"you see that as r goes
to 0, it's going to 0.",00:31:57.240,00:32:00.330
This is a different graph here.,00:32:00.330,00:32:03.010
"And actually, so this is
what's happening really.",00:32:03.010,00:32:07.720
"In terms of how likely
it is that you'll",00:32:07.720,00:32:09.730
"get within a certain distance
of the center of the target.",00:32:09.730,00:32:18.392
"Again, it's not the area under
that curve that we're doing.",00:32:18.392,00:32:20.850
It's that volume of revolution.,00:32:20.850,00:32:27.940
"We're going to
change subjects now.",00:32:27.940,00:32:29.494
"OK, one more question.",00:32:29.494,00:32:30.410
Yes.,00:32:30.410,00:32:31.937
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:32:31.937,00:32:32.770
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's supposed
to be the graph of w(r).",00:32:32.770,00:32:36.120
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:32:36.120,00:32:47.359
"PROFESSOR: Well,
so, the question is,",00:32:47.359,00:32:48.900
"wouldn't the importance
of the center be greatest?",00:32:48.900,00:32:50.983
"It's a question of which
variable you're using.",00:32:50.983,00:32:53.790
"According to pure
radius, it's not.",00:32:53.790,00:32:57.057
"It turns out that
there are some bands",00:32:57.057,00:32:58.640
"in radius which are more
important, more likely",00:32:58.640,00:33:00.930
for hits than others.,00:33:00.930,00:33:06.206
"It really has to
do with the fact",00:33:06.206,00:33:07.580
"that the center, or the core,
of the target is really tiny.",00:33:07.580,00:33:10.980
So it's harder to hit.,00:33:10.980,00:33:11.950
"Whereas a whole band around the
outside has a lot more area.",00:33:11.950,00:33:16.170
"Many, many ways
to hit that band.",00:33:16.170,00:33:18.500
So it's a much larger area.,00:33:18.500,00:33:19.810
"So there's a competition there
between those two things.",00:33:19.810,00:33:24.220
So we're going to move on.,00:33:24.220,00:33:25.910
"And I want to talk now
about a different kind",00:33:25.910,00:33:28.170
of weighted average.,00:33:28.170,00:33:30.550
"These weighted averages are
going to be much simpler.",00:33:30.550,00:33:36.410
"And they come up in what's
called numerical integration.",00:33:36.410,00:34:01.260
"There are many, many methods
of integrating numerically.",00:34:01.260,00:34:04.597
"And they're important
because many, many integrals",00:34:04.597,00:34:06.680
don't have formulas.,00:34:06.680,00:34:08.510
"And so you have to compute them
with a calculator or a machine.",00:34:08.510,00:34:13.980
"So the first type that we've
already done are Riemann sums.",00:34:13.980,00:34:24.400
"They turned out to be
incredibly inefficient.",00:34:24.400,00:34:28.170
They're lousy.,00:34:28.170,00:34:30.270
"The next rule that
I'm going to describe",00:34:30.270,00:34:32.120
is a little improvement.,00:34:32.120,00:34:33.370
"It's called the
trapezoidal rule.",00:34:33.370,00:34:38.130
"And this one is
much more reasonable",00:34:38.130,00:34:41.340
than the Riemann sum.,00:34:41.340,00:34:43.370
"Unfortunately, it's
actually also pretty lousy.",00:34:43.370,00:34:49.140
"There's another rule which is
just a slightly trickier rule.",00:34:49.140,00:34:53.150
"And it's actually
amazing that it exists.",00:34:53.150,00:34:56.030
And it's called Simpson's Rule.,00:34:56.030,00:35:01.750
"And this one is
actually pretty good.",00:35:01.750,00:35:06.690
It's clever.,00:35:06.690,00:35:07.770
So let's get started with these.,00:35:07.770,00:35:12.320
"And the way I'll get
started is by reminding you",00:35:12.320,00:35:15.030
what the Riemann sum is.,00:35:15.030,00:35:16.030
"So this is a good
review, because you need",00:35:16.030,00:35:17.779
to know all three of these.,00:35:17.779,00:35:19.790
"And you're going to want to see
them all laid out in parallel.",00:35:19.790,00:35:26.540
So here's the setup.,00:35:26.540,00:35:31.800
"OK, so here we go.",00:35:31.800,00:35:33.580
"We have our graph, we have our
function, it starts out at a,",00:35:33.580,00:35:36.660
it ends up at b.,00:35:36.660,00:35:38.240
"Maybe goes on, but we're
only paying attention",00:35:38.240,00:35:40.160
to this interval.,00:35:40.160,00:35:41.380
This is a function y = f(x).,00:35:41.380,00:35:44.760
"And we split it up when
we do Riemann sums.",00:35:44.760,00:35:48.160
"So this is 1, this
is Riemann sums.",00:35:48.160,00:35:50.450
"We start out with a, which
is a point we call x_0,",00:35:50.450,00:35:53.930
"and then we go a
certain distance.",00:35:53.930,00:35:57.370
We go all the way over to b.,00:35:57.370,00:35:58.710
"And we subdivide this
thing with these delta x's.",00:35:58.710,00:36:04.150
Which are the step sizes.,00:36:04.150,00:36:08.130
"So we have these little
steps of size delta x.",00:36:08.130,00:36:12.840
"Corresponding to these x values,
we have y values. y_0 = f(x_0),",00:36:12.840,00:36:18.860
that's the point above a.,00:36:18.860,00:36:21.090
"Then y_1 = f(x_1), that's
the point above x_1.",00:36:21.090,00:36:26.840
"And so forth, all the way
up to y_n, which is f(x_n).",00:36:26.840,00:36:33.120
"In order to figure out
the area, you really",00:36:33.120,00:36:35.650
"need to know something
about the function.",00:36:35.650,00:36:37.400
"You need to be able
to evaluate it.",00:36:37.400,00:36:39.217
So that's what we've done.,00:36:39.217,00:36:40.300
"We've evaluated here
at n + 1 points.",00:36:40.300,00:36:43.330
Enumerated 0 through n.,00:36:43.330,00:36:46.150
"And those are the
numbers out of which",00:36:46.150,00:36:48.910
"we're going to get all of our
approximations to the integral.",00:36:48.910,00:36:53.390
"So somehow we want
average these numbers.",00:36:53.390,00:36:56.370
So here's our goal.,00:36:56.370,00:37:01.780
"Our goal is to average, or add,
I'm using average very loosely",00:37:01.780,00:37:14.450
here.,00:37:14.450,00:37:14.950
"But I was going to say
add up these numbers",00:37:14.950,00:37:18.830
to get an approximation.,00:37:18.830,00:37:25.750
To average or add the y's.,00:37:25.750,00:37:30.730
"To get an approximation
to the integral.",00:37:30.730,00:37:37.670
"Which we know is the
area under the curve.",00:37:37.670,00:37:43.410
"So here's what the
Riemann sum is.",00:37:43.410,00:37:49.730
It's the following thing.,00:37:49.730,00:37:51.020
"You take y_0 plus y_1
plus... up to y_(n-1).",00:37:51.020,00:37:56.030
And you multiply by delta x.,00:37:56.030,00:37:57.520
That's it.,00:37:57.520,00:38:00.040
"Now, this one is the
one with left endpoints.",00:38:00.040,00:38:07.010
So the left-hand sum.,00:38:07.010,00:38:09.350
There's also a right one.,00:38:09.350,00:38:11.120
"Which is, if you start
at the right-hand ends.",00:38:11.120,00:38:13.210
"And that will go
from y_1 to y_n.",00:38:13.210,00:38:17.830
"OK, so this one
is the right-hand.",00:38:17.830,00:38:22.170
Right Riemann sum.,00:38:22.170,00:38:25.170
"Those are the two
that we did before.",00:38:25.170,00:38:33.110
"Now I'm going to describe
to you the next two.",00:38:33.110,00:38:35.940
"They have a similar
pattern to them.",00:38:35.940,00:38:42.410
"And the one with trapezoids
requires a picture.",00:38:42.410,00:38:51.200
Here's a shape.,00:38:51.200,00:38:53.110
And here's a bunch of values.,00:38:53.110,00:39:00.690
"And we're trying to estimate
the size of these chunks.",00:39:00.690,00:39:08.870
"And now, instead of doing
something stupid, which",00:39:08.870,00:39:10.950
"is to draw horizontal
lines in rectangles,",00:39:10.950,00:39:14.050
"we're going to do something
slightly more clever.",00:39:14.050,00:39:16.320
"Which is to draw straight
lines that are diagonal.",00:39:16.320,00:39:21.550
"You see that many
of them actually",00:39:21.550,00:39:23.177
"coincide probably pretty
closely with what I drew there.",00:39:23.177,00:39:25.510
"Although if they're curved,
they miss by a little bit.",00:39:25.510,00:39:29.650
"So this is called
the trapezoidal rule.",00:39:29.650,00:39:32.270
"Because if you pick one of
these shapes, say this is y_2",00:39:32.270,00:39:35.660
"and this is y_3, if you
pick one of these shapes,",00:39:35.660,00:39:40.120
"this height here is y_2,
and this height is y_3,",00:39:40.120,00:39:44.440
and this base is delta x.,00:39:44.440,00:39:47.720
This is a trapezoid.,00:39:47.720,00:39:52.590
"So this being a trapezoid,
I can figure out its area.",00:39:52.590,00:40:01.500
And what do I get?,00:40:01.500,00:40:02.760
"I get the base times
the average height.",00:40:02.760,00:40:12.020
"If you think about
if, you work out",00:40:12.020,00:40:14.470
"what happens when
you do something",00:40:14.470,00:40:16.060
"with a straight line
on top, like that,",00:40:16.060,00:40:18.220
you'll get this average.,00:40:18.220,00:40:21.080
"So this is the average
height of the trapezoid.",00:40:21.080,00:40:31.450
And now I want to add up.,00:40:31.450,00:40:34.580
"I want to add them all
up to get my formula",00:40:34.580,00:40:41.600
for the trapezoidal rule.,00:40:41.600,00:40:45.190
So what do I do?,00:40:45.190,00:40:46.090
"I have delta x
times the first one.",00:40:46.090,00:40:50.210
Which is (y_0 + y_1) / 2.,00:40:50.210,00:40:53.040
That's the first trapezoid.,00:40:53.040,00:40:55.010
The next one is (y_1 + y_2) / 2.,00:40:55.010,00:40:59.520
And this keeps on going.,00:40:59.520,00:41:01.710
"And at the end, I have
(y_(n-2) + y_(n-1)) / 2.",00:41:01.710,00:41:07.790
"And then last of all, I
have (y_(n-1) + y_n) / 2.",00:41:07.790,00:41:10.110
That's a very long formula here.,00:41:14.610,00:41:16.560
"We're going to simplify it
quite a bit in just a second.",00:41:16.560,00:41:21.390
What's this equal to?,00:41:21.390,00:41:22.600
"Well, notice that I get
y_0 / 2 to start out with.",00:41:22.600,00:41:28.820
"And now, y_1 got
mentioned twice.",00:41:28.820,00:41:32.930
Each time with a factor of 1/2.,00:41:32.930,00:41:35.400
So we get a whole y_1 in here.,00:41:35.400,00:41:39.405
"And the same thing
is going to be",00:41:39.405,00:41:40.780
true of all the middle terms.,00:41:40.780,00:41:43.940
"You're going to get y_2 and
all the way up to y_(n-1).",00:41:43.940,00:41:48.580
"But then, the last one is
unmatched. y_n is only 1/2,",00:41:48.580,00:41:53.750
only counts 1/2.,00:41:53.750,00:41:59.790
"So here is what's known
as the trapezoidal rule.",00:41:59.790,00:42:17.590
"Now, I'd like to
compare it for you",00:42:17.590,00:42:19.430
"to the Riemann sums, which are
sitting just to the left here.",00:42:19.430,00:42:25.480
"Here's the left one, and
here's the right one.",00:42:25.480,00:42:28.900
"If you take the average
of the left and the right,",00:42:28.900,00:42:32.570
"that is, a half of this
plus a half of that,",00:42:32.570,00:42:34.960
there's an overlap.,00:42:34.960,00:42:36.370
"The y_1 through y_n
things are listed in both.",00:42:36.370,00:42:39.250
"But the y_0 only
gets counted 1/2",00:42:39.250,00:42:41.860
"and the y_n only
gets counted 1/2.",00:42:41.860,00:42:44.170
"So what this is, is this
is the symmetric compromise",00:42:44.170,00:42:46.740
between the two Riemann sums.,00:42:46.740,00:42:49.710
"This is actually equal
to the left Riemann",00:42:49.710,00:42:54.410
"sum plus the right
Riemann sum divided by 2.",00:42:54.410,00:43:02.020
It's the average of them.,00:43:02.020,00:43:10.600
"Now, this would be great and
it does look like it's closer.",00:43:10.600,00:43:13.340
"But actually it's not as
impressive as it looks.",00:43:13.340,00:43:16.500
"If you actually
do it in practice,",00:43:16.500,00:43:18.910
it's not very efficient.,00:43:18.910,00:43:23.190
"Although it's way better
than a Riemann sum,",00:43:23.190,00:43:25.120
it's still not good enough.,00:43:25.120,00:43:27.560
"So now I need to describe
to you the fancier rule.",00:43:27.560,00:43:37.250
"Which is known as
Simpson's Rule.",00:43:37.250,00:43:52.010
"And so, this is, if
you like, 3, Method 3.",00:43:52.010,00:44:00.160
"The idea is again to
divide things into chunks.",00:44:00.160,00:44:09.770
"But now it always
needs n to be even.",00:44:09.770,00:44:16.690
"In other words, we're going
to deal not with just one box,",00:44:16.690,00:44:20.750
"we're going to deal
with pairs of boxes.",00:44:20.750,00:44:24.800
"Here's delta x, and
here's delta x again.",00:44:24.800,00:44:28.370
"And we're going to study
the area of this piece here.",00:44:28.370,00:44:34.720
"So let me focus
just on that part.",00:44:34.720,00:44:39.270
Let's reproduce it over here.,00:44:39.270,00:44:50.700
"And here's the delta
x, here's delta x.",00:44:50.700,00:44:52.684
"And of course there
are various heights.",00:44:52.684,00:44:54.350
"This starts out at
y_0, this is y_2,",00:44:54.350,00:44:57.020
and this middle segment is y_1.,00:44:57.020,00:45:03.490
"Now, the approximating curve
that we're going to use",00:45:03.490,00:45:08.200
is a parabola.,00:45:08.200,00:45:14.690
"That is, we're going to fit a
parabola through these three",00:45:14.690,00:45:17.400
points.,00:45:17.400,00:45:25.240
"And then we're going to use
that as the approximating area.",00:45:25.240,00:45:28.500
"Now, it doesn't look like--
This looks like it misses.",00:45:28.500,00:45:32.360
"But actually, most
functions mostly",00:45:32.360,00:45:34.262
"wiggle either one
way or the other.",00:45:34.262,00:45:35.720
They don't switch.,00:45:35.720,00:45:36.490
"They don't have
inflection points.",00:45:36.490,00:45:38.800
"So, this is a lousy,
at this scale.",00:45:38.800,00:45:41.320
"But when we get to
a smaller scale,",00:45:41.320,00:45:42.890
this becomes really fantastic.,00:45:42.890,00:45:45.110
As an approximation.,00:45:45.110,00:45:47.430
"Now, I need to tell you
what the arithmetic is.",00:45:47.430,00:45:52.400
"And in order to save
time, it's on your problem",00:45:52.400,00:45:56.980
set what the actual formula is.,00:45:56.980,00:46:00.080
"But I'm going to tell you
how to think about it.",00:46:00.080,00:46:05.440
"I want you to think
about it as follows.",00:46:05.440,00:46:09.530
"So the area under
the parabola is",00:46:09.530,00:46:20.530
"going to be a base times
some kind of average height.",00:46:20.530,00:46:30.800
"And the base here,
you can already see.",00:46:30.800,00:46:33.770
It's 2 delta x.,00:46:33.770,00:46:36.020
The base is 2 delta x.,00:46:36.020,00:46:39.430
"Now, the average
height is weird.",00:46:39.430,00:46:40.920
"You have to work out what
it is for a parabola,",00:46:40.920,00:46:43.070
"depending on those three
numbers, y_0, y_1, and y_2.",00:46:43.070,00:46:46.420
"And it turns out to be
the following formula.",00:46:46.420,00:46:48.760
"It has to be an
average, but it's",00:46:48.760,00:46:50.440
an interesting weighted average.,00:46:50.440,00:46:51.910
"So this was the
punchline, if you like.",00:46:51.910,00:46:53.587
"Is that they are such things as
interesting weighted averages.",00:46:53.587,00:46:56.170
"This one's very simple, it
just involves three numbers.",00:46:56.170,00:46:58.680
But it's still interesting.,00:46:58.680,00:46:59.980
It's the following.,00:46:59.980,00:47:00.771
"It turns out to be
(y_0 + 4y_1 + y_2) / 6.",00:47:00.771,00:47:07.260
Why divided by 6?,00:47:07.260,00:47:08.160
"Well, it's supposed
to be an average.",00:47:08.160,00:47:10.730
"So the total is 1 + 4
+ 1 of these things.",00:47:10.730,00:47:13.640
And 6 is in the denominator.,00:47:13.640,00:47:16.090
"So it emphasizes the
middle more than the sides.",00:47:16.090,00:47:19.790
"And that's what happens
with a parabola.",00:47:19.790,00:47:23.440
"So this is a computation
which is on your homework.",00:47:23.440,00:47:30.580
"And now we can put this together
for the full Simpson's Rule",00:47:30.580,00:47:34.440
formula.,00:47:34.440,00:47:36.190
Which I'll put up over here.,00:47:36.190,00:47:51.770
"We have here 2 delta
x, and we divide by 6.",00:47:51.770,00:47:56.350
"And then we have (y_0 +
4y_1 + y_2) / 6 plus--",00:47:56.350,00:48:03.470
That's the first chunk.,00:48:03.470,00:48:05.390
"Now, the second chunk, maybe
I'll just put it in here,",00:48:05.390,00:48:09.130
starts-- This is x_2.,00:48:09.130,00:48:11.820
This is x_0.,00:48:11.820,00:48:14.050
And it goes all the way to x_4.,00:48:14.050,00:48:15.620
"So x_2, x_3, x_4.",00:48:15.620,00:48:18.800
"So the next one involves
the indices 2, 3 and 4.",00:48:18.800,00:48:21.920
"So this is (y_2 +
4y_3 + y_4) / 6.",00:48:21.920,00:48:31.580
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, no.",00:48:31.580,00:48:34.454
"I think I'll get
rid of these 6's.",00:48:34.454,00:48:35.870
I have too many 6's.,00:48:35.870,00:48:37.990
Alright.,00:48:37.990,00:48:39.850
Let's get rid of them here.,00:48:39.850,00:48:41.057
Let's take them out.,00:48:41.057,00:48:41.890
Put them out here.,00:48:41.890,00:48:44.040
Thank you.,00:48:44.040,00:48:47.870
"All the way to the end, which is
y_(n-2) plus 2y_(n-1)-- sorry,",00:48:47.870,00:48:51.650
plus 4y_(n-1) plus y_n.,00:48:51.650,00:48:53.810
"I was about to divide
by 6, but you saved me.",00:48:57.050,00:49:01.580
So here are all the chunks.,00:49:01.580,00:49:04.350
"Now, what does this
pattern come out to be?",00:49:04.350,00:49:06.960
"This comes out to
be the following.",00:49:06.960,00:49:10.740
"This is 1, 4, 1, added to
1, 4, 1 added to 1, 4, 1.",00:49:10.740,00:49:16.950
You add them up.,00:49:16.950,00:49:17.760
"You get 1, 4, and then there's a
repeat, so you get a 2 and a 4,",00:49:17.760,00:49:22.140
and a 2 and a 4 and a 1.,00:49:22.140,00:49:24.170
"So the pattern is that it starts
out with 1's on the far ends.",00:49:24.170,00:49:29.250
And then 4's next in.,00:49:29.250,00:49:30.910
"And then it alternates
2's and 4's in between.",00:49:30.910,00:49:35.230
"So the full pattern of
Simpson's Rule is delta x / 3,",00:49:35.230,00:49:45.440
"I have now succeeded in
canceling this 2 with this 6",00:49:45.440,00:49:48.720
"and getting out
that factor of 2.",00:49:48.720,00:49:50.740
"And then here I have y0 +
4 y1 + 2 y2 + 4 y3 + ...",00:49:50.740,00:50:00.966
"It keeps on going and keeps
on going and keeps on going.",00:50:00.966,00:50:03.520
"And in the end it's 2 y_(n
- 2) + 4 y_(n - 1) + y_n.",00:50:03.520,00:50:10.820
"So again, 1 and a 4 to start.",00:50:10.820,00:50:14.860
4 and a 1 to end.,00:50:14.860,00:50:16.410
"And then alternating 2's
and 4's in the middle.",00:50:16.410,00:50:20.170
"And this weird weighted
average is way better.",00:50:20.170,00:50:25.650
As I will show you next time.,00:50:25.650,00:50:28.890
