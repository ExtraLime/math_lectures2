PROFESSOR: All right.,00:00:19.920,00:00:21.710
"Today's lecture, mostly I want
to talk about what computer",00:00:21.710,00:00:25.390
scientists do.,00:00:25.390,00:00:27.160
"We've sort of been teaching you
computer science in the",00:00:27.160,00:00:30.200
"small, I want to pull back and
think in the large about, what",00:00:30.200,00:00:34.060
"do people do once they learn
about computer science?",00:00:34.060,00:00:36.960
"And then I'll wrap up with a
quick overview of what I think",00:00:36.960,00:00:40.320
we've accomplished this term.,00:00:40.320,00:00:42.920
"So what does a computer
scientist do?",00:00:42.920,00:00:45.350
"What they really do is,
almost everything.",00:00:45.350,00:00:48.700
"Graduates of our department,
other departments, have done",00:00:48.700,00:00:51.500
"things like animation for movies
you've all seen, they",00:00:51.500,00:00:55.310
"keep airplanes from falling
out of the sky, they help",00:00:55.310,00:00:59.050
"surgeons do a better job of
brain surgery, that's",00:00:59.050,00:01:01.620
"something Professor Grimson
has worked on.",00:01:01.620,00:01:04.410
All sorts of exciting things.,00:01:04.410,00:01:10.270
"Mostly what they have in common,
and it's incredibly",00:01:10.270,00:01:13.720
"varied, what you can do with
computer science, but it all",00:01:13.720,00:01:17.220
"involves thinking
computationally.",00:01:17.220,00:01:20.260
"And if I had to use a single
phrase to describe 6.00,",00:01:20.260,00:01:25.070
that's the phrase I would use.,00:01:25.070,00:01:27.080
"The semester is really about
computational thinking.",00:01:27.080,00:01:31.610
"I think this will be a
fundamental skill used by",00:01:31.610,00:01:34.390
"everyone in the world by the
middle of the current century.",00:01:34.390,00:01:39.850
"And it'll be like the, it will
become one of the three r's,",00:01:39.850,00:01:43.790
reading writing arithmetic.,00:01:43.790,00:01:47.020
"And I haven't quite figured I
how to put an r in the front",00:01:47.020,00:01:49.810
"of it, but sooner or later.",00:01:49.810,00:01:53.780
So what is it?,00:01:53.780,00:01:54.480
"Well, the process is the process
that we've sort of",00:01:54.480,00:01:57.550
"been advocating throughout
the semester.",00:01:57.550,00:02:01.010
"You identify or invent
useful abstractions.",00:02:01.010,00:02:04.880
"Sometimes they're out there,
and we can just pluck them.",00:02:04.880,00:02:08.820
"Sometimes you have to invent
them ourselves.",00:02:08.820,00:02:12.580
"We then formulate a solution to
a problem as some sort of a",00:02:12.580,00:02:15.790
computational experiment.,00:02:15.790,00:02:19.280
"Typically using those
abstractions.",00:02:19.280,00:02:22.700
"Then comes the part that many
you get bogged down in, but",00:02:22.700,00:02:26.980
"it'll get easier for
you as you go on.",00:02:26.980,00:02:29.440
"Is to design and construct
a sufficiently efficient",00:02:29.440,00:02:33.310
"implementation of
the experiment.",00:02:33.310,00:02:36.100
"And I want to emphasize the
word sufficiently here, in",00:02:36.100,00:02:39.590
"that it only has to be
fast enough to run",00:02:39.590,00:02:42.330
it and get an answer.,00:02:42.330,00:02:43.980
"And it doesn't have to be
the fastest possible.",00:02:43.980,00:02:48.130
"We then need to validate the
experimental setup, convince",00:02:48.130,00:02:52.070
"ourselves that the code is
right, and then run the",00:02:52.070,00:02:55.390
"experiment, and then evaluate
the results, and",00:02:55.390,00:02:58.680
then repeat as needed.,00:02:58.680,00:03:01.960
"And that's, of course,
the key.",00:03:01.960,00:03:03.120
"By now you've all learned that
these experiments rarely are",00:03:03.120,00:03:07.200
"done the first time
you run them.",00:03:07.200,00:03:10.040
"But of course, this is true of
experiments in biology and",00:03:10.040,00:03:12.950
"physics and chemistry
and everything else.",00:03:12.950,00:03:16.040
But this is the basic process.,00:03:16.040,00:03:18.430
"And I think, it's a view that's
not universally held,",00:03:18.430,00:03:23.940
"but I think is the correct view
of what computational",00:03:23.940,00:03:26.800
thinking is all about.,00:03:26.800,00:03:29.280
"It's an experimental
discipline.",00:03:29.280,00:03:33.520
"So the two a's are abstraction,
choosing the",00:03:33.520,00:03:37.830
"right abstraction, and operating
in terms of multiple",00:03:37.830,00:03:42.020
"layers of abstraction
simultaneously.",00:03:42.020,00:03:45.390
"And that's a little
bit tricky.",00:03:45.390,00:03:47.360
"Something that you've
worked on this term.",00:03:47.360,00:03:50.070
"You invent some beautiful, high
level of abstraction.",00:03:50.070,00:03:56.010
"But then you have to think about
it, and implement it",00:03:56.010,00:03:58.600
"using the rather low level
abstractions provided by the",00:03:58.600,00:04:01.620
programming language.,00:04:01.620,00:04:04.810
"So we'll do a simulation of,
well, the stock market, we've",00:04:04.810,00:04:10.130
looked at it just recently.,00:04:10.130,00:04:12.310
"And you've got this abstraction
of a stock, and at",00:04:12.310,00:04:15.730
"one level, when we're thinking
about the market, we think of",00:04:15.730,00:04:18.230
"a stock abstractly, as something
that has a price",00:04:18.230,00:04:20.550
that moves up and down.,00:04:20.550,00:04:22.580
"But then at the same time, we
say, well, is the movement",00:04:22.580,00:04:25.370
"Gaussian, or uniform, and we're
operating at a somewhat",00:04:25.370,00:04:29.830
different level.,00:04:29.830,00:04:31.090
"And then at a lower level, we're
asking questions like,",00:04:31.090,00:04:34.410
"well, how should we
represent it? is?",00:04:34.410,00:04:37.100
"It a dictionary, is it a list,
that sort of thing.",00:04:37.100,00:04:41.940
"And we always bounce back and
forth and spend a lot of time",00:04:41.940,00:04:46.000
"thinking about how the
layers relate.",00:04:46.000,00:04:49.590
"Now the other thing that's
important, and it really",00:04:49.590,00:04:53.070
"distinguishes, I think,
computing from a lot of other",00:04:53.070,00:04:55.940
disciplines.,00:04:55.940,00:04:57.360
"Is, we don't just write elegant
descriptions of",00:04:57.360,00:05:02.300
"abstractions on paper, the
way you say, would do in",00:05:02.300,00:05:06.130
mathematics.,00:05:06.130,00:05:07.980
"But we have to then automate
those attractions.",00:05:07.980,00:05:11.210
"And we always think in terms of,
how can we mechanize the",00:05:11.210,00:05:14.100
abstractions?,00:05:14.100,00:05:15.490
"And that's the computational
part, in many ways.",00:05:15.490,00:05:19.510
How can we do that?,00:05:19.510,00:05:21.120
"Well, we can do it because we
have precise and exacting",00:05:21.120,00:05:25.280
"notations in which to express
these models.",00:05:25.280,00:05:29.050
"So I'll say a few words about
the model of stocks, or a few",00:05:29.050,00:05:32.870
"words about the model of a
drunk wandering around a",00:05:32.870,00:05:35.680
"field, but I can't get away
with just the words.",00:05:35.680,00:05:40.040
"Eventually I have to convert
the words to code.",00:05:40.040,00:05:44.190
"And that's sort of the
acid test of truth.",00:05:44.190,00:05:47.220
"Have I really understood
what the words mean?",00:05:47.220,00:05:50.620
"Because if I don't, I can't
actually convert it to code.",00:05:50.620,00:05:54.580
"And that's both the cursing
and the bless of being a",00:05:54.580,00:05:57.870
"computer scientist. It's
the curse because, you",00:05:57.870,00:06:02.750
"can't fake it, right?",00:06:02.750,00:06:05.210
"And that's one of the reasons
that many students end up",00:06:05.210,00:06:08.600
"spending a lot of time in
a course like 6.00.",00:06:08.600,00:06:12.620
"Because they know whether or
not their program works.",00:06:12.620,00:06:17.260
"When you write a proof in math,
you can delude we into",00:06:17.260,00:06:20.280
"thinking it's a solid proof,
when it isn't.",00:06:20.280,00:06:23.240
"When you write an essay, you
can delude yourself into",00:06:23.240,00:06:26.120
"thinking it's brilliant,
when it isn't.",00:06:26.120,00:06:28.520
"But here, you look at what it
does, and it either did what",00:06:28.520,00:06:32.250
"you thought it would
do or didn't.",00:06:32.250,00:06:34.500
"And so that means you sometimes
have to work extra",00:06:34.500,00:06:37.140
"hard, but the blessing is, when
it's done, you really",00:06:37.140,00:06:41.550
know you've done it.,00:06:41.550,00:06:43.030
"And you've got something
useful.",00:06:43.030,00:06:45.790
"And that's because there's a
machine that will execute your",00:06:45.790,00:06:49.580
descriptions.,00:06:49.580,00:06:51.450
And that's what makes it fun.,00:06:51.450,00:06:55.030
"So some examples of
computational thinking.",00:06:55.030,00:06:58.710
How difficult is this problem?,00:06:58.710,00:07:00.720
"That's what we talked about
when we talked about",00:07:00.720,00:07:02.720
complexity.,00:07:02.720,00:07:04.280
"And we talked about, for many
problems, for all problems,",00:07:04.280,00:07:08.110
"there's an intrinsic difficulty
of solving the",00:07:08.110,00:07:11.110
problem with the computation.,00:07:11.110,00:07:13.330
"Independent of how efficient
your particular solution is.",00:07:13.330,00:07:18.060
"And then the question is,
how can I best solve it?",00:07:18.060,00:07:21.800
"Theoretical computer science has
given us precise meaning",00:07:21.800,00:07:24.810
"to these and related
questions.",00:07:24.810,00:07:29.020
"Thinking recursively, another
good example.",00:07:29.020,00:07:32.500
"Where we take a seemingly
difficult problem, and",00:07:32.500,00:07:36.250
"reformulate it into one which
we know how to solve.",00:07:36.250,00:07:41.740
"Very often, it's a smaller
instance of",00:07:41.740,00:07:44.470
the original problem.,00:07:44.470,00:07:46.360
"And we say, gosh, this
is hard to solve.",00:07:46.360,00:07:49.140
"But then we think, well suppose
the list only had two",00:07:49.140,00:07:51.240
"elements in it, would I
know how to sort it?",00:07:51.240,00:07:53.780
Yeah.,00:07:53.780,00:07:55.430
"Well, then we can build up and
say, therefore I can use that",00:07:55.430,00:07:58.480
"idea to sort a list
of any size.",00:07:58.480,00:08:02.620
"As part of this thinking
recursively we learn about",00:08:02.620,00:08:05.300
"reduction, we learned how to,
say, reduce the problem of",00:08:05.300,00:08:11.990
"deciding what courses to take to
an optimization problem in",00:08:11.990,00:08:16.120
terms of the knapsack problem.,00:08:16.120,00:08:18.170
"Once we did that, we could say,
oh, we know how to solve",00:08:18.170,00:08:20.350
"all knapsack problems, dynamic
programming has been around a",00:08:20.350,00:08:23.840
"long time, we'll just do that.",00:08:23.840,00:08:27.550
"So we do a lot of these
reductions, in betting,",00:08:27.550,00:08:30.110
"transformations, transforming
one problem into another, and",00:08:30.110,00:08:33.520
simulations.,00:08:33.520,00:08:36.680
"So some other examples, choosing
an appropriate",00:08:36.680,00:08:39.430
"representation, modeling the
relevant abstracts of a",00:08:39.430,00:08:43.780
problem to make it practical.,00:08:43.780,00:08:46.100
"And this is the essence of
abstraction that computer",00:08:46.100,00:08:48.700
"scientists learn, is how to
figure out what's relevant and",00:08:48.700,00:08:53.020
"ignore what is irrelevant,
or less relevant.",00:08:53.020,00:08:57.200
Focus on the important things.,00:08:57.200,00:08:59.760
"That's an enormous
skill in not only",00:08:59.760,00:09:02.250
"computing, but in life.",00:09:02.250,00:09:05.140
"We worry about worst-case
scenarios, damage containment,",00:09:05.140,00:09:09.160
"error correction, all of this
we talked about, we talked",00:09:09.160,00:09:12.560
"about debugging, defensive
programming, making sure the",00:09:12.560,00:09:16.210
"types were right, but again
these are very general things",00:09:16.210,00:09:19.770
that we think about.,00:09:19.770,00:09:21.740
"And we think about the fact,
sometimes, it's kind of a nice",00:09:21.740,00:09:25.520
"idea, the fact that there exists
really hard problems is",00:09:25.520,00:09:29.690
actually a good thing.,00:09:29.690,00:09:32.120
"Because that's what let's us do
things like use encryption",00:09:32.120,00:09:35.720
"to get privacy of our data,
or privacy for our",00:09:35.720,00:09:39.300
"communications, privacy
of our phone calls.",00:09:39.300,00:09:42.710
"Because we have learned
that some problems are",00:09:42.710,00:09:44.970
"intrinsically difficult to
solve, and that's what coding",00:09:44.970,00:09:48.480
is all about.,00:09:48.480,00:09:50.070
Or encryption is all about.,00:09:50.070,00:09:52.470
That's a nice thing.,00:09:52.470,00:09:54.920
"I now want to talk more
specifically about what one",00:09:54.920,00:09:59.370
"group of computer
scientists does.",00:09:59.370,00:10:02.200
And that's my research group.,00:10:02.200,00:10:04.820
"Which consists of mostly
graduate students, but every",00:10:04.820,00:10:09.610
"year I try and incorporate a
few undergraduates in it.",00:10:09.610,00:10:13.170
"We work in the area of medicine,
it's also the area",00:10:13.170,00:10:15.970
"in which Professor Grimson
does most of his work.",00:10:15.970,00:10:19.080
"The goal is pretty simple: we
want to help people live",00:10:19.080,00:10:22.610
longer and better lives.,00:10:22.610,00:10:25.680
Right?,00:10:25.680,00:10:26.240
"I don't think any of you will
think that's a worthless goal.",00:10:26.240,00:10:31.250
"But, a second goal is,
we want to have fun",00:10:31.250,00:10:33.810
while we're doing it.,00:10:33.810,00:10:35.520
"Because life is way too short to
do anything that's not fun",00:10:35.520,00:10:39.500
for very long.,00:10:39.500,00:10:41.310
"So we push the frontiers of
computer science, electrical",00:10:41.310,00:10:44.450
"engineering, and medicine.",00:10:44.450,00:10:46.530
"Working in close collaboration
with physicians, and here",00:10:46.530,00:10:50.020
"you've got logos of some
of the hospitals",00:10:50.020,00:10:51.860
with which we work.,00:10:51.860,00:10:54.870
"It is, of course, fairly
technical work.",00:10:54.870,00:10:57.750
"We use machine learning,

when you do that, that the",00:11:24.040,00:11:25.910

"One of the reasons that people
are surprised by this number",00:12:43.320,00:12:47.020
"is, most folks who
have epilepsy try",00:12:47.020,00:12:49.400
to keep it a secret.,00:12:49.400,00:12:52.420

back to witches,",00:12:52.420,00:12:55.550

to be witches, were",00:12:55.550,00:12:57.780

it a secret because he",00:13:15.990,00:13:18.820
doesn't want to lose his job.,00:13:18.820,00:13:21.710

a significant fraction.",00:13:43.000,00:13:47.430

"Here's one manifestation
of it.",00:14:21.040,00:14:23.310
"On the left is an EEG, and
that's, in this case, a",00:14:23.310,00:14:27.720
"recording of the electrical
activity in the surface of",00:14:27.720,00:14:31.030
this girl's brain.,00:14:31.030,00:14:32.780
"You can see she's wearing what
looks like a very funny",00:14:32.780,00:14:35.070
looking shower cap.,00:14:35.070,00:14:36.630
"That's where the
electrodes are.",00:14:36.630,00:14:38.690
"And it's recording the
electrical activity in the",00:14:38.690,00:14:41.170
"brain, on the right is
obviously a video.",00:14:41.170,00:14:44.090
"Well, pretty frightening.",00:14:44.090,00:14:46.560
"Not all seizures are quite
that frightening.",00:14:46.560,00:14:48.770
"In fact, most of them are not.",00:14:48.770,00:14:50.570
"Sometimes people have what are
called absence seizures, where",00:14:50.570,00:14:53.720
"they just sort of black out
for a period of time.",00:14:53.720,00:14:58.600
"Still not a good thing if
you're, say, driving a car",00:14:58.600,00:15:00.870
when that happens.,00:15:00.870,00:15:03.700
"The key issue here, is that the
onset of the seizure seems",00:15:03.700,00:15:08.150
unpredictable.,00:15:08.150,00:15:10.380
"And in particular, it seems
unpredictable to the person",00:15:10.380,00:15:15.030
who has the seizure.,00:15:15.030,00:15:17.810
And that's the real risk.,00:15:17.810,00:15:19.960
"Seizures are typically
self-limiting.",00:15:19.960,00:15:22.680
"They will correct themselves
over time.",00:15:22.680,00:15:25.870
"Eventually this girl will return
to, quote, normal.",00:15:25.870,00:15:31.180
"The seizure itself will probably
be over in a minute",00:15:31.180,00:15:33.520
"or two, and for about an hour
she'll be confused, and then",00:15:33.520,00:15:37.440
she'll be OK again.,00:15:37.440,00:15:39.520
"But, because they're
unpredictable, even people who",00:15:39.520,00:15:42.760
"have as few as, say, two a year,
it dominates their life.",00:15:42.760,00:15:50.380
"So, if you're that girl, and
even if you're going to have",00:15:50.380,00:15:53.140
"one of those a year, you're
never going to be",00:15:53.140,00:15:55.350
allowed on a bicycle.,00:15:55.350,00:15:57.090
"Because if that happens when
you're on a bicycle, it's",00:15:57.090,00:15:59.640
really bad.,00:15:59.640,00:16:01.090
"If you're an adult, and you
have one or two year, you",00:16:01.090,00:16:03.710
should never drive a car.,00:16:03.710,00:16:04.960
"Imagine if you've been driving
a car when that happened.",00:16:04.960,00:16:10.210
"Almost everybody with
epilepsy eventually",00:16:10.210,00:16:13.310
suffers a serious injury.,00:16:13.310,00:16:15.360
"They have a seizure while
they're on a flight of stairs,",00:16:15.360,00:16:17.730
"and they fall down and
fracture their skull.",00:16:17.730,00:16:20.400
"They get intra-cranial
hematomas, they get burns if",00:16:20.400,00:16:23.590
"they're cooking at the stove,
they drown in the bathtub.",00:16:23.590,00:16:27.910
"And it's the unpredictability
that's bad.",00:16:27.910,00:16:32.030
"Death is high, two to three
times out of the general",00:16:32.030,00:16:34.470
population.,00:16:34.470,00:16:35.790
"Typically by accident related
to the seizure.",00:16:35.790,00:16:40.790
"And then there's something
called sudden unexplained",00:16:40.790,00:16:44.520
"death in epilepsy patients,
SUDEP, which is estimated to",00:16:44.520,00:16:50.590
"be one per 100 patients
per year.",00:16:50.590,00:16:55.270
"Just will die, and
no one knows why.",00:16:55.270,00:16:58.530
"Frequently it will be at night,
while they're in bed,",00:16:58.530,00:17:02.030
"and the conjecture is, they
have a seizure, and end up",00:17:02.030,00:17:04.590
"face down in the pillow,
smother, that kind of thing.",00:17:04.590,00:17:08.540
"So you can imagine, if you're
a parent, you have a child",00:17:08.540,00:17:10.780
"with this, you don't
sleep much.",00:17:10.780,00:17:13.820
Really very sad.,00:17:13.820,00:17:15.930
"So we want to do something
about that.",00:17:15.930,00:17:19.750
"And our idea is to detect
the seizure early.",00:17:19.750,00:17:23.780
"There are two onset times,
electrographic and clinical.",00:17:23.780,00:17:28.060
"Electrographic is when the brain
first starts looking",00:17:28.060,00:17:31.310
"suspicious, and clinical is when
there's a overt physical",00:17:31.310,00:17:36.280
"symptom, that stiffness you
saw in that young girl.",00:17:36.280,00:17:40.060
"Probably it went by too fast for
any of you to notice, but",00:17:40.060,00:17:44.090
"if you'd looked carefully at
the EEG on the left of that",00:17:44.090,00:17:47.180
"picture, you would have seen it
going abnormal before she",00:17:47.180,00:17:53.210
"had any clinical symptoms.
Because the symptoms are",00:17:53.210,00:17:57.290
"caused by the electrical
activity in the brain, by",00:17:57.290,00:18:00.410
"definition, it proceeds the
symptoms, or at least doesn't",00:18:00.410,00:18:03.670
follow them.,00:18:03.670,00:18:05.660
"So our idea was to try
and detect the",00:18:05.660,00:18:08.080
electrographic onset.,00:18:08.080,00:18:11.140
"If you could do this, you
could provide warning.",00:18:11.140,00:18:14.320
"So you could tell somebody, sit
down before you fall down.",00:18:14.320,00:18:18.600
Get out of the bathtub.,00:18:18.600,00:18:19.800
Back away from the stove.,00:18:19.800,00:18:22.460
"Just an oral warning would
be tremendously useful.",00:18:22.460,00:18:25.150
You could summon help.,00:18:25.150,00:18:27.370
"You could tell a parent, come
quick, your child is having a",00:18:27.370,00:18:31.300
"seizure right now in
bed or elsewhere.",00:18:31.300,00:18:34.640
"There are fast-acting drugs,
Ativan, which if you inhale at",00:18:34.640,00:18:39.200
"the start of a seizure, can
stop it, reduce it.",00:18:39.200,00:18:43.250
"And our particular interest
is neural stimulation.",00:18:43.250,00:18:46.930
"There is reason to believe, it's
yet to be proved, that if",00:18:46.930,00:18:51.660
"you apply the correct electrical
stimulation at the",00:18:51.660,00:18:54.840
"very beginning of a seizure,
you can block it.",00:18:54.840,00:18:58.890
"Or at least ameliorate
it greatly.",00:18:58.890,00:19:02.670
"So, here's a picture
of an EEG.",00:19:02.670,00:19:04.960
"And I'll just point
out, seizures can",00:19:04.960,00:19:07.710
be tricky to find.,00:19:07.710,00:19:08.720
"You might think this is a
seizure, but it isn't.",00:19:08.720,00:19:11.050
That's blinking your eyes.,00:19:11.050,00:19:13.570
Oh well.,00:19:13.570,00:19:16.980
"Here is the seizure, but in
fact, it's begun about here.",00:19:16.980,00:19:21.900
"Where things don't look
particularly ominous.",00:19:21.900,00:19:25.070
"So it's pretty subtle
to detect.",00:19:25.070,00:19:30.080
"One of the problems is, EEG
varies across patients.",00:19:30.080,00:19:35.060
"And epileptics have abnormal
baselines.",00:19:35.060,00:19:38.610
Yeah?,00:19:38.610,00:19:38.900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:19:38.900,00:19:48.660
"PROFESSOR: Highly variable
in patients, but",00:19:48.660,00:19:50.020
that's kind of typical.,00:19:50.020,00:19:52.800
"But that would be plenty of
time to back away from the",00:19:52.800,00:19:56.280
"stove, or get off a bicycle.",00:19:56.280,00:19:59.980
"Not so much time to get off the
Mass Turnpike, if you're",00:19:59.980,00:20:03.140
driving a car.,00:20:03.140,00:20:05.920
"But it would be great,
if you can give 10",00:20:05.920,00:20:07.700
or 15 seconds warning.,00:20:07.700,00:20:08.920
"In fact, if you could give five
seconds warning, it would",00:20:08.920,00:20:11.670
be tremendously useful.,00:20:11.670,00:20:14.280
"And for the treatments, it's
even different, right?",00:20:14.280,00:20:18.290
"Yes, you're exactly right,
in that particular case.",00:20:18.290,00:20:21.770
"The problem is, one of the
things I've discovered in",00:20:21.770,00:20:24.590
"medicine, my work, is that
almost all healthy people look",00:20:24.590,00:20:29.360
"alike, and all sick people
look different.",00:20:29.360,00:20:34.360
"So, EEG, if you have epilepsy,
your quote, normal EEG, when",00:20:34.360,00:20:40.430
"you're not having a seizure,
looks weird compared to people",00:20:40.430,00:20:44.030
who don't have epilepsy.,00:20:44.030,00:20:48.810
"People have been building
seizure detectors for about 40",00:20:48.810,00:20:52.150
"years now, and they don't
work very well.",00:20:52.150,00:20:55.740
"Every EEG that gets shipped
comes with a seizure detector,",00:20:55.740,00:20:59.790
"and the first thing most
hospitals do is, turn it off.",00:20:59.790,00:21:03.880
Because it just doesn't work.,00:21:03.880,00:21:07.400
"The good news is, that even
though each epileptics brain",00:21:07.400,00:21:11.480
"signals look different, once
you've learned what an",00:21:11.480,00:21:15.080
"individual's signal looks like,
it's pretty consistent.",00:21:15.080,00:21:19.710
"Both the interictal, between
seizure, and the",00:21:19.710,00:21:22.650
start of the seizure.,00:21:22.650,00:21:25.500
"Well, that tells a computer
scientist, let's use machine",00:21:25.500,00:21:30.380
"learning to figure out what that
patient's EEG looks like.",00:21:30.380,00:21:36.270
"And build a highly specific
detector that will work great",00:21:36.270,00:21:41.720
"for one person, and not at
all for anybody else.",00:21:41.720,00:21:45.470
"And then we'll just install
it, and you know, everyone",00:21:45.470,00:21:48.770
gets their own.,00:21:48.770,00:21:50.470
"So instead of one size fits all,
it's design a detector to",00:21:50.470,00:21:55.400
fit the patient.,00:21:55.400,00:21:58.380
"We have been working on this
now for about six years.",00:21:58.380,00:22:03.810
"We've done, we've looked at
about 80 patients now, more.",00:22:03.810,00:22:09.790
"And, highly successful.",00:22:09.790,00:22:12.730
"And I'm not going to weigh you
down with all the statistical",00:22:12.730,00:22:18.180
"tests and everything, but we've
done the kind of things",00:22:18.180,00:22:20.210
I talked about in class.,00:22:20.210,00:22:21.950
"Looking at the data, doing the
statistics, and suffice it to",00:22:21.950,00:22:25.780
"say, it works great.",00:22:25.780,00:22:27.880
"For nine out of 10 patients,
roughly.",00:22:27.880,00:22:31.600
"And for the tenth, we
just have to say,",00:22:31.600,00:22:33.250
"sorry, we can't do it.",00:22:33.250,00:22:35.600

"We're currently, what you see
here, is a picture of a neural",00:22:40.550,00:22:43.210
stimulator.,00:22:43.210,00:22:44.640
"The stimulator itself gets
implanted under the clavicle,",00:22:44.640,00:22:49.350
"and then a wire runs up and
wraps around the left vagus",00:22:49.350,00:22:52.340
"nerve, which is the longest
nerve in the human body.",00:22:52.340,00:22:56.280
"It runs all away from
the head, down",00:22:56.280,00:22:57.960
into the lower intestine.,00:22:57.960,00:22:59.780
Latin for wanderer.,00:22:59.780,00:23:01.770
"Does amazing things, like
control whether",00:23:01.770,00:23:03.760
you're hungry or not.,00:23:03.760,00:23:07.410
"Its main, one of its main
functions, is it controls the",00:23:07.410,00:23:10.680
"parasympathetic nervous
system for the heart.",00:23:10.680,00:23:13.640
"And it's the nerve that
the brain uses to tell",00:23:13.640,00:23:16.180
"the heart, slow down.",00:23:16.180,00:23:18.700
"But, in addition to transmitting
down from the",00:23:18.700,00:23:21.830
"brain, you can transmit
up the nerve.",00:23:21.830,00:23:24.890
"And in fact, the left one, for
reasons I don't understand,",00:23:24.890,00:23:28.300
"translates much better up
than the right one does.",00:23:28.300,00:23:31.520
"Which transmits much
better down.",00:23:31.520,00:23:34.570
So use the left one.,00:23:34.570,00:23:36.300
"And the notion is, if at the
start of a seizure, we put a",00:23:36.300,00:23:39.240
"current on that wire, we
stimulate the brain and we",00:23:39.240,00:23:42.870
stop the seizure.,00:23:42.870,00:23:44.550
That's the theory.,00:23:44.550,00:23:46.340
"It's been shown to stop
seizures in rats.",00:23:46.340,00:23:50.450

about helping rats.",00:23:50.450,00:23:54.780
"People purport to have shown it
stops seizures in adults,",00:23:54.780,00:23:59.180
or in people.,00:23:59.180,00:24:00.420
"The level of evidence is,
honestly, ambiguous.",00:24:00.420,00:24:04.990
"Because what they've done is,
they've implanted it, and they",00:24:04.990,00:24:09.050
give the patient a magnet.,00:24:09.050,00:24:11.160
"And say, when you're having a
seizure, swipe the magnet",00:24:11.160,00:24:13.860
"across, sorry about that, swipe
the magnet across the",00:24:13.860,00:24:17.860
"stimulator, it will turn it
on and stop your seizure.",00:24:17.860,00:24:21.310
"Well, could you imagine that
little girl trying to swipe a",00:24:21.310,00:24:23.830
magnet across her chest?,00:24:23.830,00:24:26.300
Not likely.,00:24:26.300,00:24:27.870
"So most people don't
do it successfully.",00:24:27.870,00:24:33.810
"Some people report, I thought I
was about to have a seizure,",00:24:33.810,00:24:37.110
"I swiped the magnet and
I didn't have it.",00:24:37.110,00:24:40.020
"Well, how do we know?",00:24:40.020,00:24:43.440
"Did they really stop it, or
did they just imagine they",00:24:43.440,00:24:45.670
were going to have one?,00:24:45.670,00:24:47.100
"So it's pretty ambiguous, but
we're now in the process of",00:24:47.100,00:24:50.940
"doing some real tests

patients, and controlling the",00:24:55.500,00:24:58.270

I'm optimistic.",00:24:58.270,00:25:02.850

ominous sounding.",00:25:06.870,00:25:11.300

Americans have an",00:25:11.300,00:25:14.280
"acute coronary syndrome
each year.",00:25:14.280,00:25:17.160
"That's to say, some sort
of a cardiac event.",00:25:17.160,00:25:20.630
"A heart attack, or an arrhythmia

"20 percent of them will die of a
cardiac-related event within",00:25:33.380,00:25:37.200
the next 4 years.,00:25:37.200,00:25:39.970
Pretty high.,00:25:39.970,00:25:41.530
"In fact, about 5% within the
next 90 days, there about.",00:25:41.530,00:25:47.980
So what do you do?,00:25:47.980,00:25:50.150
"The key thing, we
have treatments.",00:25:50.150,00:25:52.180
"We actually know how to treat
most of these things.",00:25:52.180,00:25:54.850
"But we don't know who to
give the treatments to?",00:25:54.850,00:25:57.960
"So, for example, who gets an
implanted defibrillator?",00:25:57.960,00:26:00.900
"Who should be treated
aggressively with statins?",00:26:00.900,00:26:05.370
"We think we've found a new way
to decide who should get which",00:26:05.370,00:26:09.040
of these kinds of treatments.,00:26:09.040,00:26:10.910
"Something called morphological
variability, which I'll talk",00:26:10.910,00:26:14.130
about only briefly.,00:26:14.130,00:26:16.410
"We've tested it on a fairly
large database.",00:26:16.410,00:26:19.510
"We have a database with
about 8,000 patients.",00:26:19.510,00:26:23.530
"We've looked at 2 days for each
patient, each day has 24",00:26:23.530,00:26:26.760
"hours, each hour has 60 minutes,
each minute has, on",00:26:26.760,00:26:30.460
"average, 70 heartbeats.",00:26:30.460,00:26:32.640
That's a lot of heartbeats.,00:26:32.640,00:26:35.970
Over a billion.,00:26:35.970,00:26:38.080
"So a lot of the techniques we've
talked about this term,",00:26:38.080,00:26:40.720
"about how do you deal with big
things, I live with every day.",00:26:40.720,00:26:45.530
"Actually, more accurately, my
students live with every day,",00:26:45.530,00:26:48.550
and I commiserate.,00:26:48.550,00:26:51.010
"But the tests are pretty
convincing.",00:26:51.010,00:26:56.350
"As an example, they're implanted
defibrillators,",00:26:56.350,00:27:01.240
"they, too, go under
the clavicle.",00:27:01.240,00:27:04.300
"Fortunately we have
two clavicles.",00:27:04.300,00:27:07.270
"And then they connect to the
heart, and they notice, they",00:27:07.270,00:27:10.870
"have a sensor, they notice the
heart is beating very badly,",00:27:10.870,00:27:14.440
and they shock the heart.,00:27:14.440,00:27:16.060
"So you've all seen medical
shows, where people put",00:27:16.060,00:27:17.950
"paddles on, say, clear, the
patient goes boom boom, and",00:27:17.950,00:27:21.700
"then they say, sinus
rhythm restored.",00:27:21.700,00:27:24.410
"Well, this does the same
thing, but you",00:27:24.410,00:27:26.310
walk around with it.,00:27:26.310,00:27:28.020
"Now, you don't want to turn on
all the time, because as you",00:27:28.020,00:27:30.700
"can see, it delivers
quite a jolt.",00:27:30.700,00:27:35.930
"Interestingly, this is an
article from this fall, from",00:27:35.930,00:27:38.490
"the New York Times, 90 percent
of the people who get one",00:27:38.490,00:27:42.970
"implanted, and the device itself
costs about $50,000,",00:27:42.970,00:27:47.260
"let alone the cost
of implanting it.",00:27:47.260,00:27:50.100
"90 percent receive negative
medical benefit.",00:27:50.100,00:27:55.100
"How do I know that they received
medical benefit?",00:27:55.100,00:27:58.890
"Well, I know that 90% of them
are never turned on.",00:27:58.890,00:28:04.190
"Remember, there's a sensor
that decides whether",00:28:04.190,00:28:06.100
to apply the shock.,00:28:06.100,00:28:07.790
"90 percent of them, the sensor
never says, turn on.",00:28:07.790,00:28:12.270
"So 90 percent of them can
deliver no benefit because",00:28:12.270,00:28:15.260
they're never used.,00:28:15.260,00:28:17.120
"On the other hand, clearly
having the surgery to implant",00:28:17.120,00:28:20.410
"this, is some risk.",00:28:20.410,00:28:23.130
"So that's why the benefit
is not only",00:28:23.130,00:28:25.290
"neutral, but negative.",00:28:25.290,00:28:26.400
"You've had fairly serious
surgery, you've risked",00:28:26.400,00:28:29.970
"infection, and, in fact, this
year several people died.",00:28:29.970,00:28:34.960
"I think three or four died
when leads broke",00:28:34.960,00:28:36.900
off on these things.,00:28:36.900,00:28:39.190
"So, clearly we're putting in too
many of them, if only 10",00:28:39.190,00:28:44.120
percent are used.,00:28:44.120,00:28:45.730
"On the other hand, roughly
every one minute and 50",00:28:45.730,00:28:49.700
"seconds, somebody in
this country dies a",00:28:49.700,00:28:51.860
sudden cardiac death.,00:28:51.860,00:28:55.790

of this lecture.",00:28:59.330,00:29:05.680
"If these people all had
defibrillators implanted, many",00:29:05.680,00:29:09.080
of them would not die.,00:29:09.080,00:29:11.120
"So, we have a therapy, we just
don't know who to give it to.",00:29:11.120,00:29:16.820
"So, what does this look like?",00:29:16.820,00:29:18.470
"Again, this is pretty
strong stuff.",00:29:18.470,00:29:25.480

death looks like.",00:29:25.480,00:29:28.660
"An apparently healthy guy,
suddenly he's dead.",00:29:28.660,00:29:34.460

remind us why we can do real",00:29:34.460,00:29:39.260
"useful things with our
talents or skills.",00:29:39.260,00:29:42.310
"So how do you identify
high risk cases?",00:29:42.310,00:29:44.930
"Lots of different ways, I won't
go through them, but",00:29:44.930,00:29:47.500
"we're focusing again
on the electrical",00:29:47.500,00:29:49.670
signals in the heart.,00:29:49.670,00:29:51.480

shape of the heartbeat and",00:29:51.480,00:29:54.670
what's going on.,00:29:54.670,00:29:57.020
"I won't go through details,
the only thing I wanted to",00:29:57.020,00:29:59.670
"point out is, we use
dynamic programming",00:29:59.670,00:30:04.010
to actually do this.,00:30:04.010,00:30:05.630
"So the key idea in our method
depends upon dynamic",00:30:05.630,00:30:09.150
programming.,00:30:09.150,00:30:13.760
"We've evaluated it
several times.",00:30:13.760,00:30:18.350
Here's one evaluation.,00:30:18.350,00:30:20.540
"We took the 25 percent of the
population that we thought was",00:30:20.540,00:30:24.780
at the highest risk.,00:30:24.780,00:30:26.680
"And you'll notice that within,
actually the first 30 days,",00:30:26.680,00:30:30.210
"4.19 percent of those
people were dead.",00:30:30.210,00:30:34.140
"This is a retrospective
study, by the way.",00:30:34.140,00:30:36.880
"The ECG had been recorded, and
we knew, we had follow-ups on",00:30:36.880,00:30:41.300
"them, and of the people we said
were not, the other 3/4",00:30:41.300,00:30:45.260
"of the population, a very
small fraction died.",00:30:45.260,00:30:49.680
"So this is called a Kaplan
Meier curve, and it",00:30:49.680,00:30:54.350
shows a huge gap.,00:30:54.350,00:30:56.260
"And in fact, roughly speaking,
if we think you were at high",00:30:56.260,00:30:59.320
"risk, you were 8 1/2 times more
likely to die within a",00:30:59.320,00:31:02.930
"month, within 90 days.",00:31:02.930,00:31:06.550

do this just so we can say,",00:31:06.550,00:31:09.580
make your will.,00:31:09.580,00:31:11.350
Get your affairs in order.,00:31:11.350,00:31:13.000

can say, all right, this is a",00:31:13.000,00:31:15.350

defibrillator, maybe should",00:31:15.350,00:31:19.700

cleaned out.",00:31:19.700,00:31:22.190

can do something about it.",00:31:24.900,00:31:28.860

just give you a flavor of the",00:31:28.860,00:31:33.640
"kinds of things you've been
learning, are really useful,",00:31:33.640,00:31:37.790
"and can be used to really do
things that are worth doing.",00:31:37.790,00:31:42.410
"So wrapping up the term,
what have you learned?",00:31:42.410,00:31:46.220
"Well, you know, I think
we'll start with this.",00:31:46.220,00:31:50.350
"If you think what you could do
in September, and what you can",00:31:50.350,00:31:54.140
"do now, you've really come
a long way, right?",00:31:54.140,00:31:57.880
"So try and go back and do
problem set number one, and",00:31:57.880,00:32:02.080
"see how long it takes you now,
and how long it took you then.",00:32:02.080,00:32:06.390

are at a place you were",00:32:06.390,00:32:09.590
not in September.,00:32:09.590,00:32:13.400
We covered five major topics.,00:32:13.400,00:32:16.150
"Learning a language for
expressing computations,",00:32:16.150,00:32:19.600
that's Python.,00:32:19.600,00:32:20.390
I already talked about the,00:32:20.390,00:32:22.000
importance of having a notation.,00:32:22.000,00:32:25.130
"Learning about the process
of writing and debugging",00:32:25.130,00:32:27.460
"programs. But more generally,
learning about the process of",00:32:27.460,00:32:32.470
"moving from some relatively
ambiguous problem statement.",00:32:32.470,00:32:36.770
"As you've all noticed in the
current problem set, we left a",00:32:36.770,00:32:39.990
lot of things unspecified.,00:32:39.990,00:32:42.360
"You know, and the email was
flying back and forth, and",00:32:42.360,00:32:44.680
"often the answer was,
you figure it out.",00:32:44.680,00:32:48.680
"Because that's one of the things
we want you to learn.",00:32:48.680,00:32:51.260
"To go from some problem
statement to a computational",00:32:51.260,00:32:54.190
formulation.,00:32:54.190,00:32:57.480
"As a tool to that, you learned
a basic set of recipes, bunch",00:32:57.480,00:33:01.410
"of different algorithms. And
you learned how to use",00:33:01.410,00:33:05.310
"simulations to deal with
problems that did not have",00:33:05.310,00:33:09.160
nice closed form solutions.,00:33:09.160,00:33:12.780
Why Python?,00:33:12.780,00:33:14.920
"Well, believe it or not, it's
an easy language to learn,",00:33:14.920,00:33:18.540
compared to other languages.,00:33:18.540,00:33:20.700
"Simple syntax, it's
interpretive, which helps with",00:33:20.700,00:33:23.610
"the debugging, you don't have to
worry about managing memory",00:33:23.610,00:33:27.230
"as you would in a language
like C. It's modern.",00:33:27.230,00:33:31.760
"It supports, in a fairly elegant
way, object-oriented",00:33:31.760,00:33:35.640
"programming and classes, and
it's increasingly popular.",00:33:35.640,00:33:39.920

going to look like?",00:36:49.850,00:36:52.610

we looked at, successive",00:37:38.980,00:37:43.010
approximation.,00:37:43.010,00:37:44.550

simpler problem.,00:37:48.980,00:37:50.850

"needed to solve, if you solve
something simpler, it",00:37:53.330,00:37:56.520
will do just fine.,00:37:56.520,00:37:58.960
"So you don't find the best
solution, you just find a",00:37:58.960,00:38:01.180
pretty good solution.,00:38:01.180,00:38:02.930

and say, well, I'm",00:38:02.930,00:38:07.560

to make my problem a little",00:38:07.560,00:38:10.050

city a to city b.",00:38:16.480,00:38:20.790

it's an easier problem to",00:38:20.790,00:38:23.740

very important.",00:38:32.140,00:38:35.990

amortized analysis, that you",00:38:35.990,00:38:39.100

something first if you were",00:38:39.100,00:38:41.336
"going to do a lot
of searching.",00:38:41.336,00:38:43.100

kinds of algorithms.",00:38:43.100,00:38:46.440

you a list with all this stuff",00:38:47.380,00:38:49.900

transcribe it.,00:38:52.750,00:38:54.700

of time on simulation.",00:39:12.580,00:39:18.890
"It's important, but maybe not as
important as all that time,",00:39:18.890,00:39:22.810
"relative to the semester, but
it gave me an excuse to talk",00:39:22.810,00:39:27.350
"about some things that
I wanted to cover.",00:39:27.350,00:39:30.120
"So it gave me a framework to
talk a little bit about",00:39:30.120,00:39:32.760
probability and statistics.,00:39:32.760,00:39:35.380

that every MIT student should",00:39:35.380,00:39:38.950
be made to take such a course.,00:39:38.950,00:39:40.880

to sneak it in here.",00:39:40.880,00:39:45.190

stuff to know.",00:39:45.190,00:39:49.460

some interesting programs. So,",00:39:49.460,00:39:54.060
"what I hope you noticed, is as I
went through these things, I",00:39:54.060,00:39:59.130

programs incrementally, to",00:39:59.130,00:40:02.810
"talk about the abstractions,
to talk about how",00:40:02.810,00:40:05.590
I would test them.,00:40:05.590,00:40:07.260

simulation itself, was the",00:40:07.260,00:40:12.980
"process of building
the simulation.",00:40:12.980,00:40:16.330

mechanism to go through some",00:40:16.330,00:40:19.380
"case studies of building some
interesting programs. It let",00:40:19.380,00:40:25.080

stochastic.,00:40:30.750,00:40:32.430

randomness in programs.",00:40:32.430,00:40:36.810

can be used to solve problems",00:40:36.810,00:40:40.470
