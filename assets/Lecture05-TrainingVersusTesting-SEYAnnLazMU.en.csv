"ANNOUNCER: The following program
is brought to you by Caltech.",00:00:00.570,00:00:03.270
YASER ABU-MOSTAFA: Welcome back.,00:00:15.410,00:00:16.660
"Last time, we talked about
error and noise.",00:00:19.150,00:00:23.580
"And these are two notions that relate
the learning problem to practical",00:00:23.580,00:00:27.940
situations.,00:00:27.940,00:00:30.540
"In the case of error measures, we
realized that in order to specify the",00:00:30.540,00:00:36.050
"error that is caused by your hypothesis,
we should try to estimate",00:00:36.050,00:00:40.360
"the cost of using your h, instead of f
which should have been used in the",00:00:40.360,00:00:45.820
first place.,00:00:45.820,00:00:47.050
"And that is something the user can
specify, of the price to pay when they",00:00:47.050,00:00:50.920
use h instead of f.,00:00:50.920,00:00:52.780
"And that is the principled way
of defining an error measure.",00:00:52.780,00:00:57.450
"In the absence of that, which happens
for quite a bit of time, we go to plan",00:00:57.450,00:01:01.580
"B and resort to analytic properties, or
practical properties of optimization,",00:01:01.580,00:01:06.560
in order to choose the error measure.,00:01:06.560,00:01:09.570
"Once you define the error between the
performance of your hypothesis versus",00:01:09.570,00:01:14.510
"the target function on a particular
point, you can plug this in, into",00:01:14.510,00:01:19.010
"different error quantities, like the
in-sample error and the out-of-sample",00:01:19.010,00:01:23.120
"error, and get those values in
terms of the error measure",00:01:23.120,00:01:26.880
by getting an average.,00:01:26.880,00:01:28.670
"In the case of the training set, you
estimate the error on the training",00:01:28.670,00:01:34.180
"points, and then you average with
respect to the N",00:01:34.180,00:01:38.900
examples that you have.,00:01:38.900,00:01:40.510
"And in the case of out-of-sample,
theoretically the definition would be",00:01:40.510,00:01:44.330
"that you also evaluate the error between
h and f on a particular point",00:01:44.330,00:01:48.810
"x, give the weight of x according to its
probability, and get the expected",00:01:48.810,00:01:52.740
value with respect to this x.,00:01:52.740,00:01:56.720
"The notion of noisy targets came from
the fact that what we are trying to",00:01:56.720,00:02:01.170
"learn may not be a deterministic
function, the only function in",00:02:01.170,00:02:04.700
"mathematics, where y is uniquely
determined by the value of x. But",00:02:04.700,00:02:09.740
"rather, when y is affected by x--",00:02:09.740,00:02:12.430
"y is distributed according to
a probability distribution, which gives",00:02:12.430,00:02:17.130
you y given x.,00:02:17.130,00:02:18.830
"And we talked about, for example, in
the case of credit application, two",00:02:18.830,00:02:23.110
"identical applications may lead
to different credit behavior.",00:02:23.110,00:02:26.210
"Therefore, the credit behavior is
a probabilistic thing, not",00:02:26.210,00:02:29.780
"a deterministic function of
the credit application.",00:02:29.780,00:02:32.510
"You can go back to our first example,
let's say, of the movie rentals.",00:02:32.510,00:02:36.360
"If you rate a movie, you may rate the
same movie at different times",00:02:36.360,00:02:40.210
"differently, depending on your
mood and other factors.",00:02:40.210,00:02:42.510
"So there's always a noise factor
in these practical problems.",00:02:42.510,00:02:45.200
"And that is captured by the transitional
probability from x to y, probability",00:02:45.200,00:02:49.450
of y given x.,00:02:49.450,00:02:52.290
"When we look at the diagram involving
this probability--",00:02:52.290,00:02:55.130
"so now we replace the target function,
which used to be a function, by",00:02:55.130,00:02:58.400
"a probability distribution, which
can be modeled as a target",00:02:58.400,00:03:00.970
function plus noise.,00:03:00.970,00:03:02.360
"And these feed into the generation
of the training examples.",00:03:02.360,00:03:06.440
"And when you look at the unknown input
distribution, which we introduced",00:03:06.440,00:03:10.680
"technically in order to get the benefit
of Hoeffding inequality,",00:03:10.680,00:03:14.230
"that also feeds into the
training example.",00:03:14.230,00:03:16.810
This determines x.,00:03:16.810,00:03:18.180
And this determines y given x.,00:03:18.180,00:03:20.210
"And then you generate these examples
independently, according to this",00:03:20.210,00:03:23.070
distribution.,00:03:23.070,00:03:24.510
"So when we had x being the only
probabilistic thing, and y being",00:03:24.510,00:03:28.780
"a deterministic function of x, then
x_1 was independent of x_2,",00:03:28.780,00:03:33.020
independent of x_N.,00:03:33.020,00:03:33.670
"And then you compute each y, according
to the function, on the",00:03:33.670,00:03:36.830
corresponding x.,00:03:36.830,00:03:38.460
"When you have the noisy version, then
the pair x_1 and y_1 is generated",00:03:38.460,00:03:44.090
"according to the joint probability
distribution, which is P of x, the",00:03:44.090,00:03:48.020
"original one, times P of y given
x, the one you introduced to",00:03:48.020,00:03:51.170
accommodate the noise.,00:03:51.170,00:03:52.850
"And then the independence lies
between different pairs.",00:03:52.850,00:03:55.630
"So x_1, y_1 would be independent of x_2,
y_2, independent of x_3, y_3 and so on.",00:03:55.630,00:04:04.820
"And when you get the expected values
for errors, you now have to take into",00:04:04.820,00:04:09.220
"consideration the probability with
respect to both x and y.",00:04:09.220,00:04:12.310
"So what used to be the expected value
with respect to x, is now the expected",00:04:12.310,00:04:16.450
value with respect to x and y.,00:04:16.450,00:04:18.329
"And then you plug in x into h, and
correspond it to the probabilistic",00:04:18.329,00:04:22.110
value of y that happened to occur.,00:04:22.110,00:04:24.210
"And that would be now the out-of-sample
error in this case.",00:04:24.210,00:04:29.640
"Now in this lecture, I'm going to start
the theory track that will last",00:04:29.640,00:04:33.690
"for this particular route three
lectures, followed by another theory",00:04:33.690,00:04:37.440
"lecture on a related but
different topic.",00:04:37.440,00:04:41.170
"And the idea is to relate training to
testing, in-sample and out-of-sample, in",00:04:41.170,00:04:46.400
a realistic way.,00:04:46.400,00:04:48.260
So the outline will be the following.,00:04:48.260,00:04:52.080
"We'll spend some time talking about
training versus testing, a very",00:04:52.080,00:04:55.830
intuitive notion.,00:04:55.830,00:04:57.160
"But we'd like to put the mathematical
framework that describes what is",00:04:57.160,00:05:00.630
training versus testing.,00:05:00.630,00:05:02.470
"And then we will introduce quantities
that will be mathematically helpful in",00:05:02.470,00:05:06.670
characterizing that relationship.,00:05:06.670,00:05:09.300
"And after I give you a number of
examples to make sure that the notion",00:05:09.300,00:05:12.320
"is clear, we are going to introduce
the key notion, the break point.",00:05:12.320,00:05:15.910
"And the break point is the one that will
later result in the VC dimension,",00:05:15.910,00:05:19.520
"the main notion in the
theory of learning.",00:05:19.520,00:05:22.230
"And finally, I end up with a puzzle.",00:05:22.230,00:05:23.580
"It's an interesting puzzle that will
hopefully fix the ideas that we talked",00:05:23.580,00:05:26.890
about in the lecture.,00:05:26.890,00:05:28.980
"So now let's talk about training
versus testing.",00:05:29.970,00:05:32.390
"And I'm going to take a very simple
example that you can relate to.",00:05:32.390,00:05:37.010
"Let's say that I'm giving
you a final exam.",00:05:37.010,00:05:40.430
So now I want to help you out.,00:05:40.430,00:05:42.270
"So before the final exam, I give you
some practice problems and solutions,",00:05:42.270,00:05:47.850
"so you can work on and prepare
yourself for the final exam.",00:05:47.850,00:05:50.890
That is very typical.,00:05:50.890,00:05:53.390
"Now if you look at the practice problems
and solutions, this would be",00:05:53.390,00:05:57.710
"your training set, so to speak.",00:05:57.710,00:06:00.740
You're going to look at the question.,00:06:00.740,00:06:01.870
You're going to answer.,00:06:01.870,00:06:02.700
"You're going to compare it
with the real answer.",00:06:02.700,00:06:04.100
"And then you are going to adjust your
hypothesis, your understanding of the",00:06:04.100,00:06:07.190
"material, in order to do it better, and
go through them and perhaps go through",00:06:07.190,00:06:10.520
"them again, until you get them right or
mostly right or figure out",00:06:10.520,00:06:15.230
the material.,00:06:15.230,00:06:15.930
"And now you are more ready
for the final exam.",00:06:15.930,00:06:20.070
"Now the reason I gave you the practice
problems and solutions is to help you",00:06:20.070,00:06:23.260
"do better on the final, right?",00:06:23.260,00:06:27.000
"Why don't I just give you the
problems on the final, then?",00:06:27.000,00:06:32.070
"Excellent idea, I can see!",00:06:32.070,00:06:34.930
Now the problem is obvious.,00:06:34.930,00:06:36.690
"The problem is that doing well
on the final is not the",00:06:36.690,00:06:40.540
"goal, in and of itself.",00:06:40.540,00:06:43.420
"The goal is for you to learn the
material, to have a small E_out.",00:06:43.420,00:06:50.810
"The final exam is only
a way of gauging how well",00:06:50.810,00:06:55.720
you actually learned.,00:06:55.720,00:06:57.930
"And in order for it to gauge how well
you actually learned, I have to give",00:06:57.930,00:07:01.920
"you the final at the point you have
already fixed your hypothesis.",00:07:01.920,00:07:07.060
You prepared.,00:07:07.060,00:07:07.880
You studied.,00:07:07.880,00:07:08.590
You discussed with people.,00:07:08.590,00:07:09.630
"You now sit down to take
the final exam.",00:07:09.630,00:07:11.960
So you have one hypothesis.,00:07:11.960,00:07:13.380
And you go through the exam.,00:07:13.380,00:07:16.010
"And therefore, your answer on, let's
say, the 50 questions of the final--",00:07:16.010,00:07:20.210
"hopefully, it's not going to be
that long if there's a final--",00:07:20.210,00:07:23.040
"will reflect what your understanding
will be outside.",00:07:23.040,00:07:26.850
So the distinction is conceptual.,00:07:26.850,00:07:29.160
"And now, let's put mathematically
what is training versus testing?",00:07:29.160,00:07:32.420
"It will be an extremely simple
distinction, although it's",00:07:32.420,00:07:35.250
an important distinction.,00:07:35.250,00:07:37.230
"Here is what testing is, in terms
of a mathematical description.",00:07:37.510,00:07:44.860
You have seen this before.,00:07:44.860,00:07:46.700
This is the plain-vanilla Hoeffding.,00:07:46.700,00:07:49.180
"This part is how well you did
on the final exam.",00:07:49.180,00:07:56.110
"This is how well you understand
the material proper.",00:07:56.110,00:07:59.330
"And since you have only one
hypothesis-- this is",00:07:59.330,00:08:01.360
"a final, you are fixed,",00:08:01.360,00:08:02.600
and you just take the exam.,00:08:02.600,00:08:05.140
"Your performance on the exam tracks well
how you understand the material.",00:08:05.140,00:08:09.440
"And therefore, the difference
between them is small.",00:08:09.440,00:08:13.100
"And the probability that it's not small
is becoming less and less, when",00:08:13.100,00:08:20.020
"the number of questions,
in this case, goes up.",00:08:20.020,00:08:22.410
So that is what testing is.,00:08:22.410,00:08:24.940
How about training?,00:08:24.940,00:08:27.140
"Almost identical, except
for one thing--",00:08:27.140,00:08:32.240
this fellow.,00:08:32.240,00:08:34.220
"Because in the case of training,
this is how you performed on",00:08:34.220,00:08:37.039
the practice problems.,00:08:37.039,00:08:38.720
"In the practice problems, you had
the answers, and you modified your",00:08:38.720,00:08:42.260
hypothesis.,00:08:42.260,00:08:42.960
"And you looked at it, and you
got an answer wrong.",00:08:42.960,00:08:45.280
So you modified your hypothesis again.,00:08:45.280,00:08:46.600
You are learning better.,00:08:46.600,00:08:47.580
That's all very nice.,00:08:47.580,00:08:49.250
"But now the practice set
is contaminated.",00:08:49.250,00:08:52.310
"You pretty much almost
memorized what it is.",00:08:52.310,00:08:54.320
"And there's a price to pay for that, in
terms of how your performance on the",00:08:54.320,00:08:57.440
"practice, which is E_in in this case,
tracks how well you understand the",00:08:57.440,00:09:01.470
"material, which is still E_out.",00:09:01.470,00:09:03.490
"And the price you pay is
how much you explored.",00:09:03.490,00:09:06.110
"And that was reflected by
the simple M, which was the number",00:09:06.110,00:09:09.750
"of hypotheses in the very simple
derivation we did.",00:09:09.750,00:09:14.240
"So if you want an executive summary of
this lecture, we are just going to try",00:09:14.240,00:09:19.340
"to get M to be replaced by something
more friendly, because you realize that",00:09:19.340,00:09:25.280
"M-- if you just measure the
complexity of your hypothesis set by",00:09:25.280,00:09:29.390
"the number of hypotheses-- this is next
to useless in almost all cases.",00:09:29.390,00:09:33.740
"Something as simple as the perceptron
has M equals infinity.",00:09:33.740,00:09:38.200
"And therefore, this guarantee
is no guarantee at all.",00:09:38.200,00:09:41.960
"If we can replace M with another
quantity, and justify that, and",00:09:41.960,00:09:46.840
"that quantity is not infinite even if
the hypothesis set is infinite, then",00:09:46.840,00:09:51.040
we are in business.,00:09:51.040,00:09:51.870
"And we can start talking about the
feasibility of learning in an actual",00:09:51.870,00:09:56.140
"model, and be able to establish
the notion in a way that we can apply",00:09:56.140,00:10:01.115
to a real situation.,00:10:01.115,00:10:02.340
That's the plan.,00:10:02.680,00:10:04.430
"We're talking about M, so the
first question is to ask, where",00:10:04.920,00:10:08.260
did this M come from?,00:10:08.260,00:10:10.250
"If we are going to replace it, we need
to understand where it came from, to",00:10:10.250,00:10:13.030
"understand the context
for replacing it.",00:10:13.030,00:10:15.650
"Well, there are bad events that
we have talked about.",00:10:15.650,00:10:21.180
"And the bad events are called
B, because they are bad.",00:10:21.180,00:10:26.430
That's good!,00:10:26.800,00:10:28.380
And then-- these are the bad events.,00:10:28.380,00:10:31.080
"What is the bad event that
we were trying to avoid?",00:10:31.080,00:10:33.830
"We were trying to avoid the situation
where your in-sample performance does",00:10:33.830,00:10:38.500
"not track the out-of-sample
performance.",00:10:38.500,00:10:40.820
"If their difference is bigger than
epsilon, this is a bad situation.",00:10:40.820,00:10:44.280
"And we're trying to say that
the probability of a bad",00:10:44.280,00:10:46.320
situation is small.,00:10:46.320,00:10:47.680
That was the starting point.,00:10:47.680,00:10:49.030
"Now we applied the union bound,
and we got the probability",00:10:51.260,00:10:55.830
of several bad events.,00:10:55.830,00:10:59.830
"This is the bad event for
the first hypothesis.",00:10:59.830,00:11:02.740
"You can see here that there
is m, a small m.",00:11:02.740,00:11:06.515
"m is 1, 2, 3, 4, up to M.
So there are M hypotheses, capital",00:11:06.515,00:11:10.960
M hypotheses that I'm talking about.,00:11:10.960,00:11:12.670
"And I would like the probability of
any of them happening to be small.",00:11:12.670,00:11:17.570
Why is that?,00:11:17.570,00:11:18.680
"Because your learning algorithm is free
to pick whichever hypothesis it",00:11:18.680,00:11:23.170
"wants, based on the examples.",00:11:23.170,00:11:25.570
"So if you tell me that the probability
of any of the bad events is small,",00:11:25.570,00:11:31.780
"then whichever hypothesis your algorithm
picks, they will be OK.",00:11:31.780,00:11:36.240
And I want that guarantee to be there.,00:11:36.240,00:11:38.690
"So let's try to understand the
probability of the B_1 or B_2 or B_M.",00:11:38.690,00:11:44.700
What does it look like?,00:11:44.700,00:11:46.910
"Well, if you look at a Venn diagram,
and you place B_1 and B_2 and B_3 as",00:11:46.910,00:11:52.580
"areas here, these areas--",00:11:52.580,00:11:55.400
these are different events.,00:11:55.400,00:11:56.480
"They could be disjoint, in which case
the circles will be far apart.",00:11:56.480,00:12:00.980
"Or they could be coincident, which
will be on top of each other.",00:12:00.980,00:12:04.480
"They could be independent, which means
that they are proportionately",00:12:04.480,00:12:07.330
overlapping.,00:12:07.330,00:12:08.070
There could be many situations.,00:12:08.070,00:12:10.300
"Now the point of the bound is that we
would like to make that statement",00:12:10.300,00:12:14.460
"regardless of the correlations
between the events.",00:12:14.460,00:12:18.400
"And therefore, we use the union bound,
which actually bounds it by the total",00:12:18.400,00:12:24.010
"area of the first one, plus the total
area of the second one, et cetera, as",00:12:24.010,00:12:27.470
if they were disjoint.,00:12:27.470,00:12:29.390
"Well, that will always hold regardless
of the level of overlap.",00:12:29.390,00:12:32.920
"But you can see that this is a poor
bound because in this case, we are",00:12:32.920,00:12:37.700
"estimating it to be about three times
the area, when it's actually closer to",00:12:37.700,00:12:41.730
"just the area, because the overlap
is so significant.",00:12:41.730,00:12:45.250
"And therefore, we would like to be able
to take into consideration the",00:12:45.250,00:12:49.220
"overlaps, because with no overlaps,
you just get M terms.",00:12:49.220,00:12:52.650
"And you're stuck with M, and
infinity, in almost all the interesting",00:12:52.650,00:12:56.440
hypothesis sets.,00:12:56.440,00:12:58.830
"Now of course, you can go--",00:12:58.830,00:13:01.500
"in principle, you can go",00:13:01.500,00:13:02.940
"and I give you the hypothesis set,
which is the perceptron.",00:13:02.940,00:13:05.840
"And you can try to formalize, what
is this bad event in terms of the",00:13:05.840,00:13:10.330
perceptron.,00:13:10.330,00:13:11.200
"And what happens when you go to the
other perceptron, and try to get the",00:13:11.200,00:13:15.310
"full joint distribution of all of these
guys, and solve this exactly.",00:13:15.310,00:13:19.560
"Well, you can, in principle--
theoretically.",00:13:19.560,00:13:22.090
"It's a complete nightmare,
completely undoable.",00:13:22.090,00:13:24.910
"And if we have to do this for every
hypothesis set you propose, there",00:13:24.910,00:13:28.800
wouldn't be learning theory around.,00:13:28.800,00:13:30.010
People will just,00:13:30.010,00:13:30.860
give up.,00:13:30.860,00:13:32.110
"So what we are going to do, we are
going to try to abstract from the",00:13:32.110,00:13:35.430
"hypothesis set a quantity that is
sufficient to characterize the",00:13:35.430,00:13:41.900
"overlaps, and get us a good bound,
without having to go through the",00:13:41.900,00:13:46.510
"intricate details of analyzing how the
bad events are correlated.",00:13:46.510,00:13:51.020
That would be the goal.,00:13:51.020,00:13:52.670
"And we will achieve it, through
a very simple argument.",00:13:52.670,00:13:56.360
So that's where M comes from.,00:13:57.150,00:14:00.370
"When we asked, can we improve on M?",00:14:00.370,00:14:02.760
Maybe M is the best we can do.,00:14:02.760,00:14:03.980
"It's not like we
wish to improve it,",00:14:03.980,00:14:05.650
so it has to be improved.,00:14:05.650,00:14:06.690
Maybe that's the best we can say.,00:14:06.690,00:14:08.620
"If you have an infinite hypothesis, then
you're stuck, and that's that.",00:14:08.620,00:14:12.250
"But it turns out that, no, the overlap
situation we talked about is actually",00:14:12.250,00:14:16.600
very common.,00:14:16.600,00:14:17.520
"Yes, we can improve on M. And the reason
is that the bad events are",00:14:17.520,00:14:22.050
"extremely overlapping in
a practical situation.",00:14:22.050,00:14:25.610
"Let's take the example we know, which
is the perceptron, to understand",00:14:25.610,00:14:31.050
what this is.,00:14:31.050,00:14:32.010
"I'm going through the example because
now we have lots of binary things--",00:14:32.010,00:14:35.560
"+1 versus -1 for the target,
+1 versus -1 for the",00:14:35.560,00:14:39.420
"hypothesis, agreeing versus
disagreeing, et cetera.",00:14:39.420,00:14:42.870
"I want to pin down exactly what is
the bad event, in terms of this picture,",00:14:42.870,00:14:46.450
"so that we understand what
we are talking about.",00:14:46.450,00:14:49.050
"Here is the target function
for a perceptron.",00:14:49.680,00:14:55.110
"And it returns +1 for some
guys, -1 for some guys.",00:14:55.110,00:14:59.000
That's easy.,00:14:59.620,00:15:01.060
"And then you have a hypothesis,
a perceptron.",00:15:01.060,00:15:04.090
And this is not the final hypothesis.,00:15:04.090,00:15:05.790
This is a badly performing hypothesis.,00:15:05.790,00:15:08.390
But it is a general perceptron.,00:15:08.390,00:15:09.930
"If you find any vector of weights,
you'll find another blue line.",00:15:09.930,00:15:14.110
"So now in terms of this picture, could
someone tell me what is E_out?",00:15:14.910,00:15:20.010
"What is the out-of-sample error for this
hypothesis, when it's applied to",00:15:20.010,00:15:23.930
this target function?,00:15:23.930,00:15:26.010
It's not that difficult.,00:15:26.500,00:15:29.290
"It is actually just these areas,
the differential areas.",00:15:29.290,00:15:34.120
This is where they disagree.,00:15:34.120,00:15:35.880
One is saying +1.,00:15:35.880,00:15:36.980
One is saying -1.,00:15:36.980,00:15:38.730
"So these two areas-- if you get the total
area if it's uniform, the total",00:15:38.730,00:15:42.100
probability,00:15:42.100,00:15:42.650
"if it's not-- then this will give
you the value of E_out.",00:15:42.650,00:15:46.500
That's one quantity.,00:15:46.500,00:15:48.740
How about E_in?,00:15:48.740,00:15:49.990
"For E_in, you need a sample.",00:15:52.600,00:15:53.980
"So first, you generate a sample.",00:15:53.980,00:15:55.410
Here's a constellation of points.,00:15:55.410,00:15:57.180
"Some of these points, as you
see, will fall into the bad",00:15:57.180,00:16:00.470
"region, here and here.",00:16:00.470,00:16:02.810
And I color them red.,00:16:02.810,00:16:04.200
"So the fraction of red compared to
all the sample gives you E_in.",00:16:04.200,00:16:10.290
That is understood.,00:16:10.800,00:16:11.620
This is E_in and E_out.,00:16:11.620,00:16:12.880
"And these are the guys that I
want to track each other.",00:16:12.880,00:16:15.130
"OK, fine.",00:16:15.130,00:16:15.490
I understand this part.,00:16:15.490,00:16:17.000
And in words.,00:16:17.000,00:16:18.730
"Now you'll look at: what is the change
E_in and E_out, when you change your",00:16:18.730,00:16:23.950
hypothesis?,00:16:23.950,00:16:25.310
So here's your first hypothesis.,00:16:25.310,00:16:28.240
Now take another perceptron.,00:16:28.240,00:16:29.750
"You probably already suspect that
this is hugely overlapping.",00:16:33.480,00:16:36.530
"Whatever you're talking about, it must
be overlapping, because they're so",00:16:36.530,00:16:39.500
close to each other.,00:16:39.500,00:16:40.570
"But let's pin down the specific event
that, we would like to argue, is",00:16:40.570,00:16:45.050
overlapping.,00:16:45.050,00:16:46.960
"So the change in E_out when you go from,
let's say, the blue hypothesis,",00:16:46.960,00:16:53.240
"this blue hypothesis, to
the green hypothesis--",00:16:53.240,00:16:56.620
"the change in E_out would be the area
of this yellow thing, not very much.",00:16:56.620,00:17:02.830
A very thin area.,00:17:02.830,00:17:05.319
"That's where E_out changed, right?",00:17:05.319,00:17:08.569
"So if you look at the area, that gives you
delta E_out. If you look at the delta E_in,",00:17:09.329,00:17:16.176
"the change of the labels
of data points--",00:17:16.176,00:17:18.150
"if one of the data points happens
to fall in this yellow region, then",00:17:18.150,00:17:23.910
"its error status will change from one
hypothesis to another, because one",00:17:23.910,00:17:27.859
"hypothesis got it right, and
the other one got it wrong.",00:17:27.859,00:17:30.680
"Now the chances of a point
falling here is small.",00:17:30.680,00:17:33.820
"So you can see why we are arguing that
the change delta E_out and the change",00:17:33.820,00:17:37.570
delta E_in is small.,00:17:37.570,00:17:38.810
"The area is small, and the probability
of a point falling there is small.",00:17:38.810,00:17:42.950
"Moreover, they are actually moving in
the same direction because the change",00:17:42.950,00:17:47.760
"is actually depending on the
area of the yellow part.",00:17:47.760,00:17:51.460
So this--,00:17:51.460,00:17:52.730
let's say that this is increasing.,00:17:52.730,00:17:54.310
"If they increase, they increase both,
because I get a net positive area for",00:17:54.310,00:17:58.240
the delta E_out.,00:17:58.240,00:17:58.950
"And the probability of falling
there also increases.",00:17:58.950,00:18:01.800
"Now, the reason I'm saying that, is
because what we care about are these.",00:18:02.670,00:18:06.680
"We would like to make the statement
that, how E_in tracks E_out for the",00:18:06.680,00:18:12.070
"first hypothesis, for the blue
perceptron, is comparable to how E_in",00:18:12.070,00:18:17.590
tracks E_out for the second one.,00:18:17.590,00:18:19.500
Why are we interested in that?,00:18:19.500,00:18:20.850
"Because we would like to argue that this
exceeding epsilon happens often,",00:18:20.850,00:18:26.620
when this exceeds epsilon.,00:18:26.620,00:18:28.240
The events are overlapping.,00:18:28.240,00:18:30.040
"We are not looking for the absolute
value of those, we are just saying",00:18:30.040,00:18:32.440
"that, if this exceeds epsilon,
this also exceeds",00:18:32.440,00:18:34.860
epsilon most of the time.,00:18:34.860,00:18:36.450
"And therefore, the picture we had
last time is actually true.",00:18:36.450,00:18:39.460
These guys are overlapping.,00:18:39.460,00:18:40.680
The bad events are overlapping.,00:18:40.680,00:18:42.080
"And at least we stand a hope that we
will get something better than just",00:18:42.080,00:18:46.440
"counting the number of hypotheses, for
the complexity we are seeking.",00:18:46.440,00:18:51.110
So we can improve M. That's good news.,00:18:51.110,00:18:54.310
"We can improve M. We're going
to replace it with something.",00:18:54.310,00:18:57.080
What are we going to replace it with?,00:18:57.080,00:18:59.380
"I'm going to introduce to you now the
notion that will replace",00:18:59.380,00:19:03.150
"M. It is not going to be completely
obvious that we can actually replace M",00:19:03.150,00:19:09.420
with this quantity.,00:19:09.420,00:19:10.850
That will require a proof.,00:19:11.400,00:19:12.600
"And that will take us
into next lecture.",00:19:12.600,00:19:14.620
"The purpose here is to define the
quantity, and make you understand it",00:19:14.620,00:19:18.860
"well, because this is the quantity that
will end up characterizing the",00:19:18.860,00:19:22.210
complexity of any model you use.,00:19:22.210,00:19:24.830
So we want to understand it well.,00:19:24.830,00:19:26.660
"And we are going to motivate that it can
replace M. It will be plausible.",00:19:26.660,00:19:29.950
It makes sense.,00:19:29.950,00:19:30.630
It's not a crazy quantity.,00:19:30.630,00:19:31.930
"It also counts the number
of hypotheses, of sorts.",00:19:31.930,00:19:35.290
"And therefore, let's define the quantity
and become familiar with it.",00:19:35.290,00:19:39.370
"And then next time, we will like the
quantity so much that we'll bite the",00:19:39.370,00:19:43.410
"bullet, and go through the proof that we
can actually replace M with",00:19:43.410,00:19:47.260
this quantity.,00:19:47.260,00:19:48.920
So what is the quantity?,00:19:49.110,00:19:51.430
"The quantity is based
on the following.",00:19:51.430,00:19:53.040
"When we count the number of hypotheses,
we obviously take into",00:19:53.040,00:19:56.990
consideration the entire input space.,00:19:56.990,00:19:59.680
What does that mean?,00:19:59.680,00:20:01.610
These are four different perceptrons.,00:20:01.610,00:20:04.840
So I take the input space.,00:20:04.840,00:20:06.270
"And the reason these guys are
different is because they are different",00:20:06.270,00:20:09.330
"on at least one point
in the input space.",00:20:09.330,00:20:12.400
"That's what makes two
functions different.",00:20:12.400,00:20:14.710
"And because the input space is infinite,
continuous, that's why we",00:20:14.710,00:20:18.970
get an infinite number of hypotheses.,00:20:18.970,00:20:21.790
"So let's say that, instead of counting
the number of hypotheses on the entire",00:20:21.790,00:20:27.900
"input space, I'm going to restrict
my attention only to the sample.",00:20:27.900,00:20:35.660
"So I generate only the input points,
which are finite points, put them on",00:20:36.800,00:20:42.760
the diagram.,00:20:42.760,00:20:43.760
"So I have this constellation
of points.",00:20:43.760,00:20:46.510
"And when I look at these points alone,
regardless of the entire input space,",00:20:46.510,00:20:50.840
those perceptrons will classify them.,00:20:50.840,00:20:52.760
"These guys will turn into red and blue,
according to the regions they fall in.",00:20:52.760,00:20:59.190
"Now, in order to fully understand what
it means to count only on the number",00:20:59.190,00:21:02.880
"of points, we have to wipe
out the input space.",00:21:02.880,00:21:05.270
So that's what I'm going to do.,00:21:05.270,00:21:06.730
That's what you have.,00:21:06.730,00:21:08.930
"So you can imagine the perceptron
is somewhere.",00:21:08.930,00:21:10.940
And it's splitting the points.,00:21:10.940,00:21:12.570
And now what I'm counting is--,00:21:12.570,00:21:14.160
"for this constellation, which is
a fixed constellation of points, how",00:21:14.160,00:21:17.590
"many patterns of red
and blue can I get?",00:21:17.590,00:21:22.200
"Now when you do this, you're not
counting the hypotheses proper,",00:21:22.960,00:21:27.630
"because the hypotheses are
defined on the input space.",00:21:27.630,00:21:29.470
"You are counting them
on a restricted set.",00:21:29.470,00:21:32.160
"But still, you're counting.",00:21:32.160,00:21:33.810
"You're counting the number
of hypotheses.",00:21:33.810,00:21:35.550
"For example, if I give you a hypothesis
set where you get all",00:21:35.550,00:21:38.620
"possible combinations of red and blue,
that's a powerful hypothesis.",00:21:38.620,00:21:42.780
"If I give you a hypothesis where you get
only few, that's not so powerful",00:21:42.780,00:21:46.400
a hypothesis.,00:21:46.400,00:21:47.490
"So the count here also corresponds in
our mind to the strength, or the power,",00:21:47.490,00:21:51.320
"of the hypothesis set, which in our mind
is what we try to capture by the crude M.",00:21:51.320,00:21:57.840
"So we are going to
count the number of hypotheses.",00:21:57.840,00:22:01.500
I'm putting them between quotations.,00:22:01.500,00:22:02.820
Why?,00:22:02.820,00:22:03.590
"Because now the hypotheses are defined
only on a subset of the points.",00:22:03.590,00:22:07.010
"So I'm going to give them a different
name, when I define them only on",00:22:07.010,00:22:09.630
"a subset of the points, in order not to
confuse the hypotheses, on the general",00:22:09.630,00:22:13.220
"input space, with this case.",00:22:13.220,00:22:15.060
I'm going to call them dichotomies.,00:22:15.060,00:22:18.810
"And the idea is that
I give you N points.",00:22:18.810,00:22:21.040
"And there is a dichotomy between what
goes into red, and what goes into blue.",00:22:21.040,00:22:25.020
That's where the name came from.,00:22:25.020,00:22:27.310
"So when you look only at the points, and
you look at this, which ones are",00:22:27.310,00:22:31.680
"blue and which ones are
red, are a dichotomy.",00:22:31.680,00:22:36.170
"And if you want to understand
it, let's look at this.",00:22:36.170,00:22:41.940
"Let's say that you're looking
at the full input space.",00:22:41.940,00:22:46.600
And this is your perceptron.,00:22:46.600,00:22:48.480
"And this is the function
it's implementing.",00:22:48.480,00:22:50.680
"And then you put a constellation
of points.",00:22:50.680,00:22:53.520
"The way to understand dichotomies is to
think that I have an opaque sheet",00:22:53.520,00:22:58.060
"of paper, that has holes in it.",00:22:58.060,00:23:03.020
"And you put that opaque sheet of paper
on top of your input space.",00:23:03.020,00:23:07.710
So you don't see the input space.,00:23:07.710,00:23:09.240
"You only see it through the
eyes of those points.",00:23:09.240,00:23:13.170
So what do you see when you put this?,00:23:13.170,00:23:14.930
You end up with this here.,00:23:14.930,00:23:16.410
You don't see anything.,00:23:16.410,00:23:17.540
You don't see where the hypothesis is.,00:23:17.540,00:23:19.270
"You just see that these guys
turned blue, and these guys",00:23:19.270,00:23:22.460
turned red or pink.,00:23:22.460,00:23:25.320
"Now as you vary the perceptron, as you
vary the line here, you are not going",00:23:25.320,00:23:30.880
"to notice it here, until the line
crosses one of the points.",00:23:30.880,00:23:35.720
"So I could be running around here, here,
here, and here, and generating",00:23:35.720,00:23:39.590
"an infinite number of hypotheses, for
which I'm charging a huge M.",00:23:39.590,00:23:43.420
"And this guy is sitting here, looking.",00:23:43.420,00:23:45.340
Nothing happened.,00:23:45.340,00:23:45.950
It's the same thing.,00:23:45.950,00:23:46.720
I'm counting it as 1.,00:23:46.720,00:23:49.220
"And then when you cross, you end
up with another pattern.",00:23:49.220,00:23:52.140
"So all of a sudden, these
guys are blue.",00:23:52.140,00:23:54.080
And these guys are red.,00:23:54.080,00:23:54.870
"That's when, let's say, this guy
is horizontal here rather",00:23:54.870,00:23:59.840
than vertical here.,00:23:59.840,00:24:01.660
"So you can always think that we reduced
the situation to where we're",00:24:01.660,00:24:04.680
"going to look at the problem exactly
as it is, except through this sheet",00:24:04.680,00:24:08.860
that has only N holes.,00:24:08.860,00:24:11.590
"Let's put, in mathematical terms, the
dichotomies which are the mini",00:24:16.035,00:24:21.860
"hypotheses, the hypotheses restricted
to the data points.",00:24:21.860,00:24:27.290
A hypothesis formally is a function.,00:24:27.290,00:24:29.990
"And the function takes the full
input space X, and produces",00:24:29.990,00:24:35.940
"-1, +1.",00:24:35.940,00:24:36.890
"That's the blue and red
region that we saw.",00:24:36.890,00:24:38.770
"A dichotomy, on the other hand,
is also a hypothesis.",00:24:41.370,00:24:44.220
"We can even give it the same name,
because it's returning the same values",00:24:44.220,00:24:46.820
"for the points it's allowed
to return values on.",00:24:46.820,00:24:51.390
"But the domain of it is not
the full input space, but very",00:24:51.390,00:24:55.380
"specifically, x_1 up to x_N.",00:24:55.380,00:24:57.710
These are--,00:24:57.710,00:24:58.750
"each one of these points belongs to
X, to the input space.",00:24:58.750,00:25:03.180
"But now I'm restricting
my function here.",00:25:03.180,00:25:05.530
"And again, the result is -1,
+1, exactly as it was here.",00:25:05.530,00:25:09.660
That's what a dichotomy is.,00:25:09.660,00:25:11.710
"Now if I ask you how many hypotheses
there are, let's say for the",00:25:13.350,00:25:16.650
perceptron case? Very easy.,00:25:16.650,00:25:20.030
It can be infinite.,00:25:20.030,00:25:21.460
"In the case of the perceptron,
it's infinite.",00:25:21.460,00:25:23.395
Why?,00:25:23.395,00:25:23.760
"Because this guy is seriously
infinite.",00:25:23.760,00:25:27.360
"So the number of functions is
just infinite, by a margin!",00:25:27.360,00:25:32.150
So that's fine.,00:25:32.150,00:25:33.510
"Now if you ask yourself, what is
the number of dichotomies?",00:25:33.510,00:25:37.630
"Let's look at the notation first,
and then answer the question.",00:25:37.630,00:25:42.500
"The dichotomy is a function
h applied to one of those.",00:25:42.500,00:25:45.130
"So when I talk about it, the value, I
would say h of x_1 or h of x_2, one",00:25:45.130,00:25:50.090
value at a time.,00:25:50.090,00:25:51.870
"If I decide to use the fancy notation,
I say I'm going to apply small h to",00:25:51.870,00:25:55.620
"the entire vector, x_1, x_2, up to x_N.",00:25:55.620,00:25:58.920
"I would be meaning that you tell me the
values of h of x on each of them.",00:25:58.920,00:26:02.870
"So you return a vector of
the values, h of x_1, h of",00:26:02.870,00:26:05.800
"x_2, up to h of x_N.",00:26:05.800,00:26:07.800
That's not an unusual notation.,00:26:07.800,00:26:11.030
"Now if you apply the entire set of
hypotheses H to that, what you",00:26:11.030,00:26:15.855
"are doing is that you are applying
each member here, which is h, to",00:26:15.855,00:26:19.810
the entire vector.,00:26:19.810,00:26:20.700
"Each time you apply one of those
guys, you get -1, -1, +1,",00:26:20.700,00:26:24.740
"+1, -1, +1, -1, et cetera.",00:26:24.740,00:26:27.410
So you get a full dichotomy.,00:26:27.410,00:26:29.890
"And then you apply another h, and you
get another dichotomy, and so on.",00:26:29.890,00:26:33.780
"However, as you vary h, which has
an infinite number of guys, many of these",00:26:33.780,00:26:38.690
"guys will return exactly the same
dichotomy, because the dichotomies",00:26:38.690,00:26:42.410
are very restricted.,00:26:42.410,00:26:42.980
I have these N points only.,00:26:42.980,00:26:44.830
"And I'm returning +1 or -1
on them only.",00:26:44.830,00:26:47.720
"So how many different ones
can I possibly get?",00:26:47.720,00:26:51.360
"At most, 2 to the N. If H is
extremely expressive, it will get",00:26:51.360,00:26:58.940
"you all 2 to the N. If not, it will get
you smaller than 2 to the N. So I",00:26:58.940,00:27:03.860
"can start with the most infinite
type of hypothesis.",00:27:03.860,00:27:06.310
"And if I translate it into dichotomies,
I have an upper bound of",00:27:06.310,00:27:10.100
"2 to the N for the number
of dichotomies I have.",00:27:10.100,00:27:12.810
"So this thing now becomes a candidate
for replacing the number of",00:27:16.220,00:27:20.890
hypotheses.,00:27:20.890,00:27:21.190
"Instead of the number of hypotheses,
we're talking about the number of",00:27:21.190,00:27:23.510
dichotomies.,00:27:23.510,00:27:25.900
Now we define the actual quantity.,00:27:25.900,00:27:28.690
Capital M is red.,00:27:28.690,00:27:30.640
And I keep it red throughout.,00:27:30.640,00:27:32.350
"And we are going now to define small
m, which I will also keep as red.",00:27:32.350,00:27:36.710
"That will hopefully, and provably
as we will see next time,",00:27:36.710,00:27:40.930
replace M. ,00:27:40.930,00:27:42.780
It's called the growth function.,00:27:42.780,00:27:44.320
"What is the idea of
the growth function?",00:27:44.320,00:27:47.190
"The growth function counts
the most dichotomies you",00:27:47.190,00:27:51.940
"can get, using your hypothesis
set on any N points.",00:27:51.940,00:27:58.930
So here is the game.,00:27:58.930,00:28:01.650
"I give you a budget N.
That's my decision.",00:28:01.650,00:28:06.220
"You choose where to place
the points, x_1 up to x_N.",00:28:06.220,00:28:11.120
"Your choice is based on your attempt
to find as many dichotomies as",00:28:11.120,00:28:15.740
"possible, on the N points, using
the hypothesis set.",00:28:15.740,00:28:20.590
"So it would silly, for example, to take
the points and put them, let's",00:28:20.590,00:28:23.570
"say, on a line, because now you are
restricted in separating them.",00:28:23.570,00:28:27.140
"But you can see the most I can
get if I put them in this general",00:28:27.140,00:28:31.360
constellation.,00:28:31.360,00:28:32.340
"And then you count the number of
dichotomies you are going to get.",00:28:32.340,00:28:35.290
"And what you're going to report to me is
the value of the growth function on",00:28:35.290,00:28:39.430
the N that I passed on to you.,00:28:39.430,00:28:41.630
"So I give you N, you go through this
exercise, and you return a number that",00:28:41.630,00:28:45.760
is the growth function.,00:28:45.760,00:28:47.340
Let's put it formally.,00:28:49.040,00:28:51.560
"The growth function is going to be
called m, in red as I promised.",00:28:51.560,00:28:55.750
And it is the maximum.,00:28:55.750,00:28:58.510
Maximum with respect to what?,00:28:58.510,00:29:00.145
"With respect to any choice of
N points from the input space.",00:29:02.680,00:29:08.570
That is your part.,00:29:08.570,00:29:09.460
"I gave you the N. So I
told you what N is.",00:29:09.460,00:29:13.190
"And then you chose x_1 up to x_N with
a view to maximizing something.",00:29:13.190,00:29:17.980
What are you maximizing?,00:29:17.980,00:29:19.230
"Well, we had this funny notation.",00:29:21.850,00:29:25.360
"H applied to this entire
vector is actually the set of",00:29:25.360,00:29:30.100
"dichotomies, the vectors, -1, +1,
-1, +1, and then the",00:29:30.100,00:29:33.910
"next guy and the next guy--
the actual vectors here.",00:29:33.910,00:29:39.000
"When you put this cardinality on top
of them, you're just counting them.",00:29:39.000,00:29:41.880
"You're asking yourself: how
many dichotomies do I get?",00:29:41.880,00:29:45.290
"So you're maximizing, with respect to the
choice of x_1 up to x_N, this thing.",00:29:45.290,00:29:49.880
"That will give you the most expressive
facet of the hypothesis set on N",00:29:49.880,00:29:55.560
"points, that number.",00:29:55.560,00:29:56.710
I tell you 10.,00:29:56.710,00:29:57.690
And you come back with the number 500.,00:29:57.690,00:29:59.500
"It means that by your choice of the x_1 up
to x_10, you managed to generate 500",00:29:59.500,00:30:03.730
"different guys, according to the
hypothesis set that I gave you.",00:30:03.730,00:30:08.850
"Now because of this, you can see now
that there is an added notation here.",00:30:08.850,00:30:12.490
"It used to be m, but it actually
depends on the hypothesis set, right?",00:30:12.490,00:30:16.470
"It's the growth function for
your hypothesis set.",00:30:16.470,00:30:18.790
"So I'm making that dependency explicit,
by putting a subscript H.",00:30:18.790,00:30:24.990
"Furthermore, this is
a full-fledged function.",00:30:24.990,00:30:27.580
M was a number.,00:30:27.580,00:30:28.720
I give you a hypothesis set.,00:30:28.720,00:30:29.910
It's an number.,00:30:29.910,00:30:30.480
"Well, it happens to be infinite,
but it's a number.",00:30:30.480,00:30:33.490
"Here, I'm giving you
a full function.",00:30:33.490,00:30:36.360
"That is, I tell you N, you tell me
what the growth function is.",00:30:36.360,00:30:39.620
So it's a little bit more complicated.,00:30:39.620,00:30:41.220
"And because it is this way, m_H is
actually a function of N. That's the",00:30:41.220,00:30:46.420
growth function.,00:30:46.420,00:30:48.570
So that is the notion.,00:30:48.570,00:30:51.330
"Now what can we say about
the growth function?",00:30:52.160,00:30:54.700
"Well, if the number of dichotomies is
at most 2 to the N, because that's as",00:30:54.700,00:30:58.790
"many +1, -1, N-tuples you can
produce, then the maximum of them is",00:30:58.790,00:31:04.270
"also bounded by the same thing, at most
2 to the N. Well, if we are going",00:31:04.270,00:31:10.070
"to replace M with m, I would say
2 to the N is an improvement",00:31:10.070,00:31:15.050
over infinity.,00:31:15.050,00:31:16.660
If we can afford to do it.,00:31:16.660,00:31:18.030
"Maybe it's not a great improvement,
nonetheless improvement.",00:31:18.030,00:31:20.450
"Now, let's apply the definition to
the case of perceptrons, in order to",00:31:23.440,00:31:27.370
"give it flesh, so we understand
what the notion is.",00:31:27.370,00:31:30.100
It's not just an abstract quantity.,00:31:30.100,00:31:32.470
"We take the perceptrons, and we would
like to get the growth function",00:31:34.630,00:31:37.620
of the perceptrons.,00:31:37.620,00:31:38.360
"Well, getting the growth function of
the perceptron is quite a task.",00:31:38.360,00:31:41.040
"If I tell you what is M
for the perceptron? Infinity.",00:31:41.040,00:31:44.110
And then you go home.,00:31:44.110,00:31:45.550
"What is the growth function
of the perceptron?",00:31:45.550,00:31:47.200
"You have to tell me what is the growth
function at N equals 1, what is at N",00:31:47.200,00:31:50.640
"equals 2, at N equals
3, at N equals 4.",00:31:50.640,00:31:52.980
It's a whole function.,00:31:52.980,00:31:54.720
"So we say, 1 and 2 is easy.",00:31:54.720,00:31:57.360
Let's start with N equals 3.,00:31:57.360,00:32:02.430
So I'm choosing 3 points.,00:32:02.430,00:32:04.190
"And I chose them wisely, so that I can
maximize the number of dichotomies.",00:32:04.190,00:32:09.010
"And now I'm asking myself, what is the
value of the growth function for the",00:32:09.010,00:32:13.050
"perceptron for the value
N equals 3?",00:32:13.050,00:32:15.920
"Well, it's not that difficult.",00:32:15.920,00:32:18.600
"You can see, I can actually get
everything there is to get.",00:32:18.600,00:32:22.890
Why?,00:32:22.890,00:32:23.170
"Because I can have my line here, or I
can have my line here, or I can have",00:32:23.170,00:32:29.330
my line here.,00:32:29.330,00:32:31.120
"That's 3 possibilities times 2 because
I can make it +1 versus two -1's,",00:32:31.120,00:32:35.820
or -1 versus two +1's.,00:32:35.820,00:32:37.590
We are counting 6 so far.,00:32:37.830,00:32:39.850
"And then I can have my hypothesis
sitting here.",00:32:39.850,00:32:42.560
That will make them all +1.,00:32:42.560,00:32:44.270
"Or I can have it sitting here, which
makes them all -1.",00:32:44.270,00:32:48.176
That's 8.,00:32:48.176,00:32:48.590
That's all of them.,00:32:48.590,00:32:49.910
"The perceptron hypothesis is as strong
as you can get, if you only restrict",00:32:49.910,00:32:54.530
your attention to 3 points.,00:32:54.530,00:32:56.750
So the answer would be what?,00:32:56.750,00:32:58.860
Is it already 8?,00:32:58.860,00:33:00.460
Wait a minute.,00:33:00.460,00:33:01.690
"Someone else chose the points co-linear,
and then found out that if",00:33:01.690,00:33:06.870
"you want these guys to go to the -1
class, and this guy to go to the +1",00:33:06.870,00:33:11.780
"class, there is no perceptron
that is capable of doing this.",00:33:11.780,00:33:16.000
Correct?,00:33:16.000,00:33:17.000
"You cannot pass a line that will make
these two guys go to +1, and this",00:33:17.000,00:33:20.320
"guy go to -1,",00:33:20.320,00:33:21.350
if these are co-linear.,00:33:21.350,00:33:23.450
Does this bother us?,00:33:23.450,00:33:25.750
No.,00:33:25.750,00:33:26.780
Because we are taking the maximum.,00:33:26.780,00:33:29.630
"So this, the quantity you computed
here, since you got to the 8-- you",00:33:29.630,00:33:32.670
cannot go above 8.,00:33:32.670,00:33:33.810
That defines it.,00:33:33.810,00:33:34.670
"And indeed, you can with authority
answer the question that the growth",00:33:34.670,00:33:37.830
"function for this case,
m at N equals 3, is 8.",00:33:37.830,00:33:43.290
"Now let's see if we are still in
luck when we go to N equals 4.",00:33:43.290,00:33:48.010
"What is the growth function
for 4 points?",00:33:48.010,00:33:50.820
"We'll choose the point in
general position again.",00:33:50.820,00:33:53.230
"We are not going to have any
co-linearity, in order to",00:33:53.230,00:33:55.590
maximize our chances.,00:33:55.590,00:33:57.110
"But then we are stuck with
the following problem.",00:33:57.110,00:34:00.160
"Even if you choose the points in
general position, there is this",00:34:00.160,00:34:04.170
constellation--,00:34:04.170,00:34:05.580
"there is this particular pattern on the
constellation, which is -1,",00:34:05.580,00:34:08.810
"-1, and +1, +1.",00:34:08.810,00:34:11.060
"Can you generate this
using a perceptron?",00:34:11.060,00:34:13.780
"No. And the opposite of it,
you cannot either.",00:34:13.780,00:34:17.790
"If this was -1, -1, and
this one, +1, +1.",00:34:17.790,00:34:22.090
"Can you find any other 4 points, where
you can generate everything?",00:34:22.090,00:34:26.710
No.,00:34:26.710,00:34:27.260
"I can play around, and there is always
2 missing guys, or even worse.",00:34:27.260,00:34:30.820
"If I choose the points unwisely,
I will be missing more of them.",00:34:30.820,00:34:34.350
"So the maximum you are getting is that
you are missing 2 out of all the",00:34:34.350,00:34:38.429
possibilities.,00:34:38.429,00:34:39.570
"And the growth function here is 14, not
16, as it might have been if you",00:34:39.570,00:34:44.000
had the maximum.,00:34:44.000,00:34:45.659
"Now this is a very satisfactory
result, because perceptrons are",00:34:45.659,00:34:49.710
pretty limited models.,00:34:49.710,00:34:51.389
"We use them because they are
simple, and there's a nice algorithm",00:34:51.389,00:34:54.230
that goes with them.,00:34:54.230,00:34:55.770
"So we have to expect that the quantity
we are measuring the sophistication of",00:34:55.770,00:35:00.550
"the perceptrons with, which is the
growth function, had better not be the",00:35:00.550,00:35:04.150
maximum possible.,00:35:04.150,00:35:05.040
"Because if it's the maximum possible,
then we are declaring: perceptrons are",00:35:05.040,00:35:07.610
as strong as can be.,00:35:07.610,00:35:08.960
Now they break.,00:35:08.960,00:35:10.720
And they are limited.,00:35:10.720,00:35:12.540
"And if I pick another model, which,
let's say-- just for the extreme",00:35:12.540,00:35:15.560
case-- the set of all hypotheses.,00:35:15.560,00:35:17.520
"What would be the growth function
for the set of all hypotheses?",00:35:17.520,00:35:20.660
"It would be 2 to the N, because
I can generate anything.",00:35:20.660,00:35:23.490
"So now, according to this measure that
I just introduced, the set of all",00:35:23.490,00:35:27.170
"hypotheses is stronger
than the perceptrons.",00:35:27.170,00:35:30.020
"Satisfactory result, simple
but satisfactory.",00:35:30.020,00:35:32.360
Now what I'm going to do--,00:35:35.660,00:35:37.330
"I'm going to take some examples, in
which we can compute the growth",00:35:37.330,00:35:40.980
"function completely for all values of
N. You can see that if I continued",00:35:40.980,00:35:45.450
"with this and say, let's
go with the perceptron.",00:35:45.450,00:35:47.240
5 points.,00:35:47.240,00:35:48.260
"You put the 5 points,
and then you try.",00:35:48.260,00:35:49.990
Am I missing this?,00:35:49.990,00:35:51.360
"Or maybe if I change the position
of the points.",00:35:51.360,00:35:53.550
"It's just a nightmare, just to get 5.",00:35:53.550,00:35:55.390
"And basically, if you just do it by
brute force, it's not going to happen.",00:35:55.390,00:35:59.580
"So I'm taking examples where we can
actually, by a simple counting",00:35:59.580,00:36:02.690
"argument, get the value of the growth
function for the entire domain,",00:36:02.690,00:36:07.030
"N from 1 up to infinity, in
order to get a better feel for the",00:36:07.030,00:36:11.230
growth function.,00:36:11.230,00:36:11.860
That's the purpose of this portion.,00:36:11.860,00:36:13.150
"Our first model, I'm going
to call positive rays.",00:36:17.020,00:36:19.700
"Let's look at what positive
rays look like.",00:36:19.700,00:36:24.270
They are defined on the real line.,00:36:24.270,00:36:25.840
"So the input space is
R, the real numbers.",00:36:25.840,00:36:30.010
And they are very simple.,00:36:30.010,00:36:31.800
"From a point on, which we are going to
call 'a'-- this is the parameter that",00:36:31.800,00:36:36.790
"decides one hypothesis versus
the other in this",00:36:36.790,00:36:39.520
particular hypothesis set.,00:36:39.520,00:36:41.500
"All the points that are
bigger go to +1.",00:36:41.500,00:36:44.170
"All the points that are
smaller go to -1.",00:36:44.170,00:36:46.890
"And it's called positive ray, because
here is the ray-- very simple",00:36:46.890,00:36:50.390
hypothesis set.,00:36:50.390,00:36:52.980
"Now in order to define the growth
function, I need a bunch of points.",00:36:52.980,00:36:56.930
So I'm going to generate some points.,00:36:56.930,00:36:59.100
I'm going to call them x_1 up to x_N.,00:36:59.100,00:37:02.250
"And I am going to choose them
as general as possible.",00:37:02.250,00:37:05.550
"I guess there is very little generality
when you're talking about a line.",00:37:05.550,00:37:08.140
"Just make sure that they don't
fall on each other.",00:37:08.140,00:37:09.910
"If they fall on each other, you cannot
really dichotomize them at all.",00:37:09.910,00:37:13.160
"If you put them separately,
you'll be OK.",00:37:13.160,00:37:15.070
So you have these N points.,00:37:15.070,00:37:17.130
"Now when you apply your hypothesis,
the particular hypothesis that is",00:37:17.130,00:37:20.300
"drawn on the slide, to these points,
you are going to get this pattern.",00:37:20.300,00:37:25.970
True?,00:37:25.970,00:37:28.060
"And you're asking yourself, how many
different patterns I can get on these",00:37:28.060,00:37:32.640
"N points by varying my hypothesis,
which means that I'm varying",00:37:32.640,00:37:37.410
the value of 'a'?,00:37:37.410,00:37:39.250
"That is the parameter that gives me
one hypothesis versus the other.",00:37:39.250,00:37:43.090
"Formally, the hypothesis set is a set
from the real numbers to -1, +1.",00:37:43.090,00:37:50.130
"And I can actually find
an analytic formula here.",00:37:50.130,00:37:53.200
"If you want an analytic formula,
you remember the sign?",00:37:53.200,00:37:56.630
"This is, I think--",00:37:56.630,00:37:57.890
"If you apply it, that's exactly
what I described.",00:37:57.890,00:38:00.900
"Now we ask ourselves, what
is the growth function?",00:38:00.900,00:38:05.420
Here is a very simple argument.,00:38:05.930,00:38:09.000
"If you have N points, the value of the
dichotomy-- which ones go to blue",00:38:09.000,00:38:13.940
"and which ones go to red-- depends on
which segment between the points",00:38:13.940,00:38:19.490
'a' will fall in.,00:38:19.490,00:38:21.050
"If 'a' falls here, you get this pattern.",00:38:21.050,00:38:23.410
"If 'a' falls here, this guy will be red.",00:38:23.410,00:38:26.530
And the rest of the guys will be blue.,00:38:26.530,00:38:28.590
So I get a different dichotomy.,00:38:28.590,00:38:30.260
"I get different dichotomies when
I choose a different line segment.",00:38:30.260,00:38:34.890
"How many line segments are
there to choose from?",00:38:34.890,00:38:38.310
I have N points.,00:38:38.310,00:38:39.650
"I have N minus 1 sandwiched ones, and
one here when all of them are red,",00:38:39.650,00:38:46.240
and one here when all of them are blue.,00:38:46.240,00:38:49.130
Right?,00:38:49.130,00:38:49.890
So I have N plus 1 choices.,00:38:49.890,00:38:52.250
"And that's exactly the number of
dichotomies I'm going to get on N",00:38:52.250,00:38:55.050
"points, regardless of what N is.",00:38:55.050,00:38:57.350
"So I found that the growth function,
for this thing, is exactly",00:38:57.350,00:39:01.420
N plus 1.,00:39:01.420,00:39:02.670
"Let's take a more sophisticated model,
and see if we get a bigger growth",00:39:05.020,00:39:09.020
"function. Because that's
the whole idea, right?",00:39:09.020,00:39:11.860
The next guy is positive intervals.,00:39:11.860,00:39:15.280
What are these?,00:39:16.210,00:39:17.260
"They're like the other guys, except
they're a little bit more elaborate.",00:39:17.260,00:39:20.470
"Instead of having a ray,
you have an interval.",00:39:20.470,00:39:23.000
"Again, you're talking
about the real line.",00:39:23.000,00:39:25.020
"And you are going to define
an interval from here to here.",00:39:25.020,00:39:28.010
"And anything that lies within
here, will map to +1",00:39:28.010,00:39:31.150
and will become blue.,00:39:31.150,00:39:32.270
"And anything outside, whether it's right
or left, will go to -1.",00:39:32.270,00:39:36.210
"That's obviously more powerful than the
previous one, because you can think",00:39:36.830,00:39:40.350
"of the positive ray as having
an infinite interval.",00:39:40.350,00:39:42.760
That's fine.,00:39:42.760,00:39:44.940
So you put the points.,00:39:44.940,00:39:47.330
We have done this before.,00:39:47.330,00:39:49.030
And they get classified this way.,00:39:49.030,00:39:52.310
"And I'm asking myself, how many
different dichotomies I can get now by",00:39:52.310,00:39:57.430
"choosing really 2 parameters, the
beginning of the interval and the end",00:39:57.430,00:40:01.380
of the interval.,00:40:01.380,00:40:02.200
"These are my 2 parameters, that will tell
me one hypothesis versus the other.",00:40:02.200,00:40:05.370
How many different patterns can I get?,00:40:05.370,00:40:08.270
"Again, the function is very simple.",00:40:08.270,00:40:10.200
"It's defined on the real numbers.
And now the counting argument, which is",00:40:10.200,00:40:14.570
an interesting one.,00:40:14.570,00:40:16.020
"The way you get a different dichotomy
is by choosing 2 different line",00:40:18.010,00:40:23.880
"segments, to put the ends
of the interval in.",00:40:23.880,00:40:29.400
"If I start the interval here and
end it here, I get something.",00:40:29.400,00:40:32.220
"If I start the interval here and end
it here, I get something else.",00:40:32.220,00:40:35.030
"If I start the interval here and
end here, I get something else.",00:40:35.030,00:40:39.030
"And that is exactly one-to-one mapping
between the dichotomies and the choice",00:40:39.030,00:40:44.330
of 2 segments.,00:40:44.330,00:40:45.580
"So if this is the case, then I can
very simply say that the growth",00:40:48.110,00:40:51.920
"function, in this case, is the number
of ways to pick 2 segments out the",00:40:51.920,00:40:56.770
N plus 1 segments.,00:40:56.770,00:40:59.590
And that would be N plus 1 choose 2.,00:40:59.590,00:41:04.780
There is only 1 missing.,00:41:04.780,00:41:07.780
"When you count, there are 2 rules--",00:41:07.780,00:41:10.510
"make sure that you count everything,
and make sure that you don't count",00:41:10.510,00:41:14.030
anything twice.,00:41:14.030,00:41:15.400
Very simple.,00:41:15.400,00:41:16.520
So we counted almost everything.,00:41:16.520,00:41:19.210
But the missing guy here is what?,00:41:19.210,00:41:21.355
Let's say that all of them are blue.,00:41:23.860,00:41:26.800
Is this counted already?,00:41:26.800,00:41:28.010
"Yes, because I can choose this
segment and this segment.",00:41:28.010,00:41:31.650
And that is already counted in this.,00:41:31.650,00:41:34.990
"But if they're all red,
what does that mean?",00:41:34.990,00:41:38.270
"It means that the beginning of the
interval, and the end of the interval,",00:41:38.270,00:41:40.850
happen to be within the same segment.,00:41:40.850,00:41:42.270
So they didn't capture any point.,00:41:42.270,00:41:44.040
"And that, I didn't count.",00:41:44.040,00:41:46.120
"And it doesn't matter which segment
they're in, because I will get just",00:41:46.120,00:41:49.050
the all reds.,00:41:49.050,00:41:49.920
So it's one dichotomy.,00:41:49.920,00:41:51.160
So all I need to do is just add 1.,00:41:51.160,00:41:55.100
And that's the number.,00:41:55.100,00:41:57.070
"Do a little algebra, and you get this.",00:41:57.070,00:41:59.930
"That is the growth function
for this hypothesis set.",00:41:59.930,00:42:04.210
"And now I'm happy, because
I see it's quadratic.",00:42:04.210,00:42:06.840
"It's more powerful than the previous
guy, which was linear.",00:42:06.840,00:42:09.490
"Now let's up the ante, and
go to the third one.",00:42:12.210,00:42:17.240
Convex sets.,00:42:17.240,00:42:19.970
"This time, I'm taking the
plane, rather than the line.",00:42:19.970,00:42:25.120
So it's R squared.,00:42:25.120,00:42:27.130
"And my hypotheses are simply
the convex regions.",00:42:27.130,00:42:31.550
"If you look at the values of x at
which the hypothesis is +1, this",00:42:31.550,00:42:37.260
"has to be a convex region,
any convex region.",00:42:37.260,00:42:40.830
"A convex region is a region where,
if you pick any 2 points within the",00:42:40.830,00:42:46.100
"region, the entirety of the line segment
connecting them lies within",00:42:46.100,00:42:50.630
the region.,00:42:50.630,00:42:51.160
That's the definition.,00:42:51.160,00:42:52.740
"So this is my artwork
for a convex region.",00:42:52.740,00:42:57.090
You take any 2 points and--,00:42:57.090,00:42:58.530
So this is an example of that.,00:42:58.530,00:42:59.890
The blue is the +1.,00:42:59.890,00:43:01.090
And the red is the -1.,00:43:01.090,00:43:02.070
That's the entire space.,00:43:02.070,00:43:03.430
So this is a valid hypothesis.,00:43:03.430,00:43:06.070
"Now you can see that there is
an enormous variety of convex sets that",00:43:06.070,00:43:12.100
qualify as hypotheses.,00:43:12.100,00:43:13.550
"But there are some which
don't qualify.",00:43:13.550,00:43:15.610
"For example, this one is not convex,
because of this fellow.",00:43:15.610,00:43:19.610
"Here's the line segment, and
it went out of the region.",00:43:19.610,00:43:21.700
So that's not convex.,00:43:21.700,00:43:22.400
"We understand what the
hypothesis set is.",00:43:22.400,00:43:24.650
Now we come to the task.,00:43:24.650,00:43:26.100
"What is the growth function
for this hypothesis set?",00:43:26.100,00:43:28.710
"In other to answer this, what you
need is-- you put your points.",00:43:32.480,00:43:35.900
"I give you N, and you place them.",00:43:35.900,00:43:37.750
So here is a cloud of points.,00:43:37.750,00:43:40.790
"I give you N, and you say, it seems
like putting them in general",00:43:40.790,00:43:43.920
position is a good idea.,00:43:43.920,00:43:45.950
"So let's put them in
a general position.",00:43:45.950,00:43:48.200
"And let's try to see how many patterns
I can get out of these,",00:43:48.200,00:43:51.040
using convex regions.,00:43:51.040,00:43:54.580
"Man, this is going to be tough
because I can see--",00:43:54.580,00:43:57.370
Let's see.,00:43:57.370,00:43:58.310
"First, I cannot get all
of them, right?",00:43:58.310,00:44:00.800
"Because let's say I take the outermost
points, and map them all to +1.",00:44:00.800,00:44:06.530
"This will force all the internal points
to be +1, because I'm using",00:44:06.530,00:44:10.140
a convex region.,00:44:10.140,00:44:11.790
"Therefore, I cannot get +1's for
the out guys, and any -1",00:44:11.790,00:44:16.670
whatsoever inside.,00:44:16.670,00:44:18.080
So that excludes a lot of dichotomies.,00:44:18.080,00:44:20.490
"Now I have to do real
counting.",00:44:20.490,00:44:23.960
But wait a minute.,00:44:23.960,00:44:25.160
"The criterion for choosing the cloud of
points was not to make them look good",00:44:25.160,00:44:28.290
"and general, but to maximize
your growth function.",00:44:28.290,00:44:32.290
"Is there another choice for the
points that gives me more",00:44:32.290,00:44:35.910
hypotheses than these?,00:44:35.910,00:44:38.240
"As a matter of fact, is there another
choice, for where I put the points, that",00:44:38.240,00:44:41.900
"will give me all possible dichotomies
using convex regions?",00:44:41.900,00:44:46.680
"If you succeed in that, then you
don't care about this cloud.",00:44:46.680,00:44:50.960
"The other one will count, because
you are taking the maximum.",00:44:50.960,00:44:53.690
Here is the way to do it.,00:44:53.690,00:44:56.400
"Take a circle, and put your points
on the perimeter of that circle.",00:44:56.400,00:45:01.671
"Now I maintain that you can get any
dichotomy you want on these points.",00:45:04.760,00:45:10.480
What is the argument?,00:45:10.480,00:45:11.480
"Well, pick your favorite one.",00:45:11.480,00:45:14.490
"I have a bunch of blues
and a bunch of reds.",00:45:14.490,00:45:16.890
"Can I realize this using
a convex region?",00:45:16.890,00:45:18.930
Yes.,00:45:18.930,00:45:21.550
I just connect these guys.,00:45:21.550,00:45:23.490
"And the interior of this
goes to +1.",00:45:23.490,00:45:26.030
"And whatever is outside
goes to -1.",00:45:26.030,00:45:28.060
"And I am assured it's convex, because
the points are on the",00:45:28.060,00:45:30.320
perimeter of a circle.,00:45:30.320,00:45:33.650
That means what?,00:45:34.420,00:45:36.040
"That means that the growth
function is 2 to the N,",00:45:36.040,00:45:40.450
notwithstanding the other guy.,00:45:40.450,00:45:43.180
"You realize now a weakness in
defining the growth function as the",00:45:43.180,00:45:46.220
"maximum, because in a real learning
situation, the chances are the points",00:45:46.220,00:45:50.200
"you're going to get are not going to
end up on a perimeter of a circle.",00:45:50.200,00:45:53.500
"They are likely to be
all over the place.",00:45:53.500,00:45:55.350
"And some of them will be interior
points, in which case you're not",00:45:55.350,00:45:58.600
going to get all possibilities.,00:45:58.600,00:46:01.000
"But we don't want to keep studying the
particular probability distribution,",00:46:01.000,00:46:05.130
"and the particular data
set you get, and so on.",00:46:05.130,00:46:07.590
"We would like to have
a simple quantity.",00:46:07.590,00:46:09.860
"And therefore, we're taking the maximum
overall, which will have",00:46:09.860,00:46:12.240
a simple combinatorial property.,00:46:12.240,00:46:14.350
"The price we pay is that, the chances are
the bound we are going to get is",00:46:14.350,00:46:18.820
not going to be as tight as possible.,00:46:18.820,00:46:21.280
But that's a normal price.,00:46:21.280,00:46:22.470
"If you want a general result that
applies to all situations, it's not",00:46:22.470,00:46:25.880
"going to be all that tight
in any given situation.",00:46:25.880,00:46:28.560
That is the normal tradeoff.,00:46:28.560,00:46:30.760
"But here, the growth function is
indeed 2 to the N.",00:46:30.760,00:46:36.010
"Just as a term, when you get all
possible hypotheses, all possible",00:46:36.010,00:46:39.460
"dichotomies, you say that the hypothesis
set shattered the points--",00:46:39.460,00:46:44.750
broke them in every possible way.,00:46:44.750,00:46:46.860
"So we can say, can we shatter
this set, et cetera?",00:46:46.860,00:46:48.995
That's what it means.,00:46:48.995,00:46:49.720
"You get all possible combinations
on them. Just as a term.",00:46:49.720,00:46:53.790
"Now let's look at the 3 growth functions
on one slide, in order to be",00:46:53.790,00:46:57.080
able to compare.,00:46:57.080,00:46:58.250
"We started with the positive rays, and
we got a linear growth function.",00:46:58.250,00:47:04.190
"And then we went on to the
positive intervals.",00:47:04.190,00:47:07.480
And we had a quadratic function.,00:47:07.480,00:47:11.020
"And that is good, because we are getting
more sophisticated and the",00:47:11.020,00:47:13.750
growth function is getting bigger.,00:47:13.750,00:47:15.850
"And then we went to convex
sets, which are--",00:47:15.850,00:47:18.150
"It's powerful and two-dimensional
and all, but not that powerful.",00:47:18.150,00:47:20.940
Convex sets are still--,00:47:20.940,00:47:22.650
"It's really, although we got a bigger
one, it's inordinately bigger.",00:47:22.650,00:47:26.050
Maybe we should have gotten N cubed.,00:47:26.050,00:47:27.710
But that's what we have.,00:47:27.710,00:47:29.340
At least it goes this way.,00:47:29.340,00:47:30.400
"So sometimes that thing
will be too much.",00:47:30.400,00:47:33.380
"But in general, you can see the trend
that, with more sophisticated, you get",00:47:33.380,00:47:36.560
a bigger growth function.,00:47:36.560,00:47:38.360
"Now let's go back to the big picture,
to see where that growth",00:47:39.830,00:47:42.410
function will fit.,00:47:42.410,00:47:44.020
Remember this inequality?,00:47:45.110,00:47:47.010
"Oh, yes.",00:47:47.010,00:47:47.930
We have seen it.,00:47:47.930,00:47:49.110
We have seen it often.,00:47:49.110,00:47:50.030
We are tired of it!,00:47:50.030,00:47:53.110
"What we are trying to do is replace M.
And we decided to replace",00:47:53.110,00:48:00.960
it with the growth function m.,00:48:00.960,00:48:04.130
M can be infinity.,00:48:04.130,00:48:05.770
"m is a finite number, at most
2 to the N, so that's good.",00:48:05.770,00:48:09.880
"What happens if we replace
M with small m?",00:48:09.880,00:48:12.770
"Let's say that we can do that, which
we'll establish in the next lecture.",00:48:12.770,00:48:16.380
What will happen?,00:48:16.380,00:48:19.040
"If your growth function happens to
be polynomial, you are in great shape.",00:48:19.040,00:48:28.660
Why is that?,00:48:28.660,00:48:30.550
"Because if you look at this quantity,
this is a negative exponential.",00:48:30.550,00:48:35.540
"epsilon can be very, very small.",00:48:35.540,00:48:37.540
"epsilon squared can be really,
really, really small.",00:48:37.540,00:48:40.190
"But this remains a negative exponential
in N. And for any choice",00:48:40.190,00:48:44.720
"of epsilon you wish, this will kill the
heck out of any polynomial you put",00:48:44.720,00:48:50.460
"here, eventually.",00:48:50.460,00:48:53.890
Right?,00:48:53.890,00:48:54.760
"I can put a 1000th-order polynomial,
and can have epsilon equal 10",00:48:54.760,00:48:58.130
to the minus 6.,00:48:58.130,00:48:59.640
"And if you're patient enough, or if your
customer has enough data, which",00:48:59.640,00:49:03.020
"would be an enormous amount of data, you
will eventually get this to win.",00:49:03.020,00:49:07.200
"And you will get the probability to be
diminishingly small, which means that",00:49:07.200,00:49:10.540
you can generalize.,00:49:10.540,00:49:12.830
"That's a very attractive observation,
because now all you need",00:49:12.830,00:49:16.370
"to do is just declare that this is
polynomial, and you're in business.",00:49:16.370,00:49:21.350
"We saw that it's not that easy
to evaluate this explicitly.",00:49:21.350,00:49:25.000
"But maybe, there is a trick that will
make us able to declare that it is",00:49:25.000,00:49:29.310
polynomial.,00:49:29.310,00:49:30.660
"And once you declare that a hypothesis
set has a polynomial growth function,",00:49:30.660,00:49:34.630
"we can declare that learning is feasible
using that hypothesis, period.",00:49:34.630,00:49:38.870
"We may become finicky and ask ourselves,
how many examples do you",00:49:38.870,00:49:42.150
"need for what, et cetera?",00:49:42.150,00:49:43.430
"But at least, we know we can do it.",00:49:43.430,00:49:45.170
"If you're given enough examples, you
will be able to generalize from",00:49:45.170,00:49:48.450
"a finite set, albeit big, to the general
space with a probability assurance.",00:49:48.450,00:49:54.750
So that's pretty good.,00:49:55.380,00:49:57.560
I'm happy that this is the case.,00:49:58.150,00:50:00.000
"So maybe we can, as I mentioned, just
prove that m_H is polynomial, the",00:50:00.000,00:50:04.345
growth function is polynomial.,00:50:04.345,00:50:05.580
Can we do that?,00:50:05.580,00:50:06.570
Maybe we can.,00:50:06.570,00:50:07.540
Maybe we cannot.,00:50:07.540,00:50:08.600
"Here's the key notion that
will enable us to do that.",00:50:08.600,00:50:11.700
"We are going to define what
is called the break point.",00:50:14.580,00:50:17.690
"You give me a hypothesis set, and
I tell you it has a break point.",00:50:17.690,00:50:20.470
"Perceptrons, 4.",00:50:20.950,00:50:22.200
"Another set, the break point is 7.",00:50:24.650,00:50:27.370
Just one number.,00:50:27.370,00:50:30.410
"That's much better than giving
me a full growth function for",00:50:30.410,00:50:33.150
every N. Just one number.,00:50:33.150,00:50:35.430
So what is the break point?,00:50:35.430,00:50:37.930
The definition is the following.,00:50:37.930,00:50:40.400
"It's the point at which you fail
to get all possible dichotomies.",00:50:40.400,00:50:46.120
"So you can see that, if the break point
is 3, this is not a very fancy",00:50:46.120,00:50:49.370
hypothesis set.,00:50:49.370,00:50:50.070
"I can't even generate all 8
possibilities on 3 points.",00:50:50.070,00:50:54.120
"If the break point is 100, well, that's
a pretty respectable guy, because I can",00:50:54.120,00:50:57.810
"generate everything up to 99 points,
all 2 to the 99 of them.",00:50:57.810,00:51:02.130
And then I start failing at 100.,00:51:02.130,00:51:03.730
"So you can see that the break point
also has a correspondence to the",00:51:03.730,00:51:06.500
complexity of the hypothesis set.,00:51:06.500,00:51:09.730
"If no data set of size k can
be shattered by H--",00:51:09.730,00:51:15.615
"that is, if there are no choice of
k points in which you are able to",00:51:15.615,00:51:21.080
generate all possible dichotomies.,00:51:21.080,00:51:23.700
Then you call k a break point for H.,00:51:23.700,00:51:26.898
So let's look at--,00:51:29.400,00:51:31.270
what is the--,00:51:31.270,00:51:32.450
So that's what it means.,00:51:32.620,00:51:33.880
"You can't shatter, so less than
2 to the k, which are all the",00:51:33.880,00:51:36.980
possibilities for k data points.,00:51:36.980,00:51:39.830
"So for the 2D perceptron, can you
think of what is the break point?",00:51:39.830,00:51:44.580
We did it already.,00:51:44.580,00:51:45.370
"We didn't explicitly say
it in those terms.",00:51:45.370,00:51:47.540
But this is the hint.,00:51:47.540,00:51:50.660
"For 3, we did everything.",00:51:50.660,00:51:51.990
"For 4, we knew we cannot
do everything.",00:51:51.990,00:51:55.560
"So it doesn't matter whether
it's 14 or 15 or 12 or 5.",00:51:55.560,00:52:00.790
"As long as it breaks, it breaks.",00:52:00.790,00:52:02.230
It's not 16.,00:52:02.230,00:52:03.800
"And therefore, in this case,
the break point is 4.",00:52:03.800,00:52:08.490
"That number 4 will characterize the
perceptrons. Just to tell me, I",00:52:08.490,00:52:12.720
have a hypothesis set.,00:52:12.720,00:52:14.090
And it is defined--,00:52:14.090,00:52:15.450
I don't want to know the input space.,00:52:15.450,00:52:17.190
Wait a minute.,00:52:17.410,00:52:17.850
"OK, I'm not going to tell
you the input space.",00:52:17.850,00:52:18.790
I'm going to tell you the hypotheses.,00:52:18.790,00:52:20.070
The hypotheses are produced by the--,00:52:20.070,00:52:21.650
I don't want to hear it.,00:52:21.650,00:52:22.820
"Just tell me the break point, and I will
tell you the learning behavior.",00:52:22.820,00:52:27.290
"Also, if you have a break point,",00:52:27.290,00:52:32.410
"every bigger point is also
a break point.",00:52:32.410,00:52:34.980
"That is, if you cannot get all
possibilities on 10 points, then you",00:52:34.980,00:52:38.750
"certainly cannot get
all of them on 11.",00:52:38.750,00:52:40.520
"If you could get them on 11,
just kill one.",00:52:40.520,00:52:42.140
And you will have gotten them on 10.,00:52:42.140,00:52:43.710
"Let's look at the 3 examples, and
find what are the break points.",00:52:46.940,00:52:49.230
Positive rays had this guy.,00:52:52.020,00:52:53.740
This is a formula.,00:52:53.740,00:52:54.880
"We can plug in for N. And we
ask ourselves, when do I get to the",00:52:54.880,00:52:58.830
"point where I no longer get 2 to the N,
numerically for a particular value.",00:52:58.830,00:53:04.070
What is the break point here?,00:53:05.460,00:53:07.100
N equals 1.,00:53:07.100,00:53:07.990
I get 1 plus 1.,00:53:07.990,00:53:08.720
That's 2.,00:53:08.720,00:53:09.370
That also happens to be 2 to the 1.,00:53:09.370,00:53:11.170
2: N plus 1 is 3.,00:53:12.230,00:53:14.830
"Oh, that's less than 4.",00:53:14.830,00:53:16.800
So 2 must be a break point.,00:53:16.800,00:53:19.750
This is,00:53:19.750,00:53:21.230
"since we invested in computing the
function, we are just lazy now and",00:53:21.230,00:53:23.720
just substituting.,00:53:23.720,00:53:24.920
"But you could go for the original thing,
and say that's obvious.",00:53:24.920,00:53:28.080
"Because this particular combination
of points--",00:53:28.080,00:53:30.760
"if I want the rightmost point to be
red, and the left one to be blue,",00:53:30.760,00:53:33.830
"there is no way for the positive
ray to generate that.",00:53:33.830,00:53:37.610
"And therefore, that 2 is a break point.",00:53:37.610,00:53:39.280
There's something where I fail.,00:53:39.280,00:53:42.620
Let's go for this one.,00:53:42.620,00:53:44.120
We need faster calculators now.,00:53:44.120,00:53:46.140
"1, 1/2, et cetera.",00:53:46.140,00:53:50.310
Wow.,00:53:51.970,00:53:52.520
It's exactly.,00:53:52.520,00:53:53.240
"When I put 1, it gives me 2.",00:53:53.240,00:53:54.860
It must be the correct formula.,00:53:54.860,00:53:56.440
Let's write 2.,00:53:56.440,00:53:57.440
"At 4, I get 2.",00:53:57.660,00:53:59.290
And--,00:53:59.290,00:54:00.245
it calculates. What is the break point?,00:54:00.245,00:54:01.590
"It must be bigger than the other guy,
because it's more elaborate.",00:54:05.760,00:54:08.260
And you realize it's 3.,00:54:08.260,00:54:10.400
"If you put 2 points,
you will get the 4.",00:54:10.400,00:54:12.260
"And if you put 3, you'll get
7, which is short of 8.",00:54:12.260,00:54:15.630
"Again, that's not a mystery.",00:54:15.630,00:54:18.320
"That's what you cannot get
using the interval.",00:54:18.320,00:54:21.140
"You cannot get the middle point to be
red while the other ones are blue.",00:54:21.140,00:54:24.350
"So you cannot get all possibilities
on 3 points.",00:54:24.350,00:54:26.610
"Therefore, 3 is a break point.",00:54:26.610,00:54:27.860
"What is the break point
for the convex sets?",00:54:30.820,00:54:35.660
Tell me how many points where I can fail.,00:54:35.660,00:54:37.600
"Well, I'm never going to fail.",00:54:37.600,00:54:38.820
"So if you like, you can
say this is infinity.",00:54:38.820,00:54:42.750
Let's define it,00:54:42.750,00:54:43.340
this way.,00:54:43.340,00:54:44.560
"So also, the break point--
just a single number--",00:54:44.560,00:54:47.230
has the property we want.,00:54:47.230,00:54:48.540
"It gets more sophisticated as the
model gets more sophisticated.",00:54:48.540,00:54:52.090
So what is the main result?,00:54:52.090,00:54:55.380
"The main result is that the
first part will be--",00:54:55.380,00:54:59.570
"if you don't have a break point,
I have news for you.",00:54:59.570,00:55:04.280
"The growth function is
2 to the N. OK, yes.",00:55:04.280,00:55:07.220
That's the definition.,00:55:07.220,00:55:08.250
Thank you.,00:55:08.250,00:55:09.740
"So that cannot possibly
be the main result.",00:55:09.740,00:55:11.780
So what is the main result?,00:55:11.780,00:55:14.840
"The main result is that if you
have a break point, any",00:55:14.840,00:55:18.630

"We are going to make a statement
about the growth function.",00:55:29.450,00:55:32.040

[MAKES DRUM SOUND],00:55:35.515,00:55:39.400
It's guaranteed to be polynomial in N.,00:55:39.400,00:55:43.750
"Wow, we have come a long way.",00:55:43.750,00:55:46.630
"I used to ask you what
are the hypotheses,",00:55:46.630,00:55:48.630
and count them.,00:55:48.630,00:55:49.430
"That was hopeless because
it's infinity.",00:55:49.430,00:55:51.760
"We defined the growth function,
and we have to evaluate it.",00:55:51.760,00:55:53.960
That was painful.,00:55:53.960,00:55:55.820
Then we found the break point.,00:55:55.820,00:55:57.340
"Maybe it's easier to compute
the break point.",00:55:57.340,00:55:59.140
"I just want to find a clever way,
and say that I cannot get it.",00:55:59.140,00:56:03.100
"Now all I need to hear from you
is that there is a break point.",00:56:03.100,00:56:07.820
"And I'm in business as far as the
generalization is concerned, because I",00:56:07.820,00:56:11.310
"know that regardless of what polynomial
you get, you will be able",00:56:11.310,00:56:14.400
to learn eventually.,00:56:14.400,00:56:15.640
"I will become more particular, and ask you
what is the break point, when I try to",00:56:15.640,00:56:18.690

you can use this hypothesis set,",00:56:22.530,00:56:25.810

"And I have to give you a puzzle
to appreciate it.",00:56:35.200,00:56:38.190
"The idea of the puzzle
is the following.",00:56:38.190,00:56:40.220
"If I just tell you that there's
a break point, the constraint on the",00:56:40.220,00:56:44.420
"number of dichotomies you get,",00:56:44.420,00:56:46.530
"because there is a break point,",00:56:46.530,00:56:48.260
is enormous.,00:56:48.260,00:56:50.240
"If I tell you a break point is,
let's say, 3, how many",00:56:50.240,00:56:53.840
can you get on 100 points?,00:56:53.840,00:56:55.750
"On those 100 points, for any choice of
3 guys, you cannot have all",00:56:55.750,00:57:00.940
"possible combinations-- at any 3 points,
all 100 choose 3 of them.",00:57:00.940,00:57:07.230
"So the combinatorial restriction
is enormous.",00:57:07.230,00:57:10.570
"And you will end up losing possible
dichotomies in droves, because of that",00:57:10.570,00:57:14.780
restriction.,00:57:14.780,00:57:15.780
"And therefore, the thing that used to
be 2 to the N, if it's unrestricted,",00:57:15.780,00:57:18.830
will collapse to polynomial.,00:57:18.830,00:57:21.460
"Let's take a puzzle, and try to
compute this in a particular case.",00:57:21.460,00:57:24.990
Here is the puzzle.,00:57:24.990,00:57:27.850
We have only 3 points.,00:57:27.850,00:57:30.180
"And for this hypothesis set, I'm telling
you that the break point is 2.",00:57:30.180,00:57:36.120
"So you cannot get all possible four
dichotomies on any 2 points.",00:57:36.120,00:57:42.410
"If you put x_1 and x_2, you cannot get
-1 -1, -1 +1,",00:57:42.410,00:57:47.050
"+1 -1, and +1 +1. All of them.",00:57:47.050,00:57:50.080
You cannot get it.,00:57:50.080,00:57:50.580
One of them has to be missing.,00:57:50.580,00:57:53.370
"So I'm asking you, given that this is
the constraint, how many dichotomies can",00:57:53.370,00:57:57.620
you get on 3 points?,00:57:57.620,00:57:59.910
"You can see, this is what I'm trying to
do because I'm telling you that the",00:57:59.910,00:58:02.100

"If I didn't have the restriction,
I would be putting eight.",00:58:04.490,00:58:06.910
So I'm just telling you this case.,00:58:06.910,00:58:08.080

"For visual clarity, I'm going to
express them as either black or white",00:58:09.830,00:58:14.440

instead of writing -1 or +1.,00:58:16.400,00:58:18.120
This dichotomy is fine.,00:58:18.700,00:58:19.830
It doesn't violate anything.,00:58:19.830,00:58:21.390
I've only one possibility.,00:58:21.390,00:58:23.910
So we keep adding.,00:58:23.910,00:58:26.870
Everything is fine.,00:58:26.870,00:58:27.860
"As a matter of fact, everything will
remain fine until we get to four, because",00:58:27.860,00:58:31.530
"the whole idea is that I cannot
get all four on any of them.",00:58:31.530,00:58:34.120
"So if I have less than four, I cannot
possibly get four combinations.",00:58:34.120,00:58:37.050

"And we will take the questions
after a short break.",01:00:51.880,01:00:54.382
Let's start with the questions.,01:01:02.254,01:01:03.950
"MODERATOR: The first question is,
what if the target or the",01:01:03.950,01:01:07.670
hypotheses are not binary?,01:01:07.680,01:01:09.740
PROFESSOR: There is a counterpart,01:01:09.740,01:01:12.190
"for the entire theory that
I'm going to develop, for",01:01:12.190,01:01:15.560
"real-valued functions and other
types of functions.",01:01:15.560,01:01:19.840
"The development of the theory is
technical enough, that I'm going to",01:01:19.840,01:01:25.370
"develop it only for the binary case,
because it is manageable.",01:01:25.370,01:01:29.620
"And it carries all of the
concepts that you need.",01:01:29.620,01:01:32.820
The other case is more technical.,01:01:32.820,01:01:36.260
"And I don't find the value of going to
that level of technicality useful, in",01:01:36.260,01:01:42.020
terms of adding insight.,01:01:42.020,01:01:43.930
"What I'm going to do is, I'm going
to apply a different approach to",01:01:43.930,01:01:47.800
"real-valued functions, which is
the bias-variance tradeoff.",01:01:47.800,01:01:51.240
"And it's a completely different approach
from this one, that will give",01:01:51.240,01:01:54.560
"us another angle on generalization
that is particularly suitable for",01:01:54.560,01:01:58.320
real-valued functions.,01:01:58.320,01:01:59.700
"But the short answer is that, if the
function is not binary, there is",01:01:59.700,01:02:03.510
"a counterpart to what I'm
saying that will work.",01:02:03.510,01:02:06.510
"But it is significantly more technical
than the one I am developing.",01:02:06.510,01:02:11.970
MODERATOR: Just as a sanity check.,01:02:11.970,01:02:14.500
"When the hypothesis set can
shatter the points, this is",01:02:14.505,01:02:20.410
"a bad thing, right?",01:02:20.410,01:02:22.650
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:02:22.650,01:02:24.260
"There is a tradeoff that will stay
with us for the entire course.",01:02:24.260,01:02:29.640
It's bad and good.,01:02:29.640,01:02:32.340
"If you shatter the points, it's good
for fitting the data, because I know",01:02:32.340,01:02:36.220
"that if you give me the data, regardless
of what your data is, I'm",01:02:36.220,01:02:39.270
"going to be able to fit them because, I
have something that can generate",01:02:39.270,01:02:42.040
"a hypothesis for any particular
set of combinations.",01:02:42.040,01:02:45.110
"So if your question is,
can I fit the data?",01:02:45.110,01:02:47.790
Then shattering is good.,01:02:47.790,01:02:49.810
"When you go to generalization,
shattering is bad, because basically",01:02:49.810,01:02:53.290
you can get anything.,01:02:53.290,01:02:55.040
"So it doesn't mean anything
that you fit the data.",01:02:55.040,01:02:57.280
"And therefore, you have less hope
of generalization, which will be",01:02:57.280,01:02:59.850
"formalized through the
theoretical results.",01:02:59.850,01:03:02.140
"And the correct answer is, what is the
good balance between the two extremes?",01:03:02.140,01:03:08.630
"And then we'll find a value for which
we are not exactly shattering the",01:03:08.630,01:03:12.310
"points, but we are not very restricted,
in which we are getting some",01:03:12.310,01:03:15.470
"approximation,",01:03:15.470,01:03:16.470
and we're getting some generalization.,01:03:16.470,01:03:18.110
And that will come up.,01:03:18.110,01:03:21.040
"MODERATOR: Is there a similar
trick to the one you used for convex",01:03:21.040,01:03:24.000
sets in higher dimensions?,01:03:24.000,01:03:25.250
PROFESSOR: So if you--,01:03:29.060,01:03:31.640
"The principle I explained,
I explained it in terms of",01:03:31.650,01:03:36.610
two-dimensional and perceptrons.,01:03:36.610,01:03:39.040
"If you look at the essence
of it, the space is X.",01:03:39.040,01:03:43.285
It could be anything.,01:03:43.285,01:03:45.300
"The only restrictions I have
are binary functions.",01:03:45.300,01:03:47.810
So this could be a high-dimensional space.,01:03:47.810,01:03:49.590
"And the surfaces will be very
sophisticated surfaces.",01:03:49.590,01:03:52.160
"And all I'm reading off, as far as this
lecture is concerned, is how many",01:03:52.160,01:03:56.370
"patterns do I get on a number
of N points.",01:03:56.370,01:03:58.680
"MODERATOR: Also a question
on the complexity.",01:04:02.000,01:04:04.700
"Why is usually polynomial time
considered as acceptable?",01:04:04.710,01:04:08.200
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:04:08.200,01:04:09.050
"Polynomial, in this case, is polynomial
growth in the number of points N.",01:04:09.050,01:04:15.560
"It just so happens that we are working
with the Hoeffding inequality that",01:04:15.560,01:04:20.300
"gives us a very helpful term, which
is the negative exponential.",01:04:20.300,01:04:24.580
"And therefore, if you get a polynomial,
as I mentioned, any",01:04:24.580,01:04:28.180
"polynomial, you are guaranteed that for
a large enough N, the probability--",01:04:28.180,01:04:31.795
"the right-hand side of the Hoeffding,
including the growth",01:04:31.795,01:04:34.780
"function, will be small.",01:04:34.780,01:04:36.150
"And therefore, the probability of
something bad happening is small.",01:04:36.150,01:04:39.080
"Now obviously, there are other functions
that also will be killed by",01:04:39.640,01:04:45.730
the negative exponential.,01:04:45.730,01:04:47.290
"For example, if I had a growth function
of the form, let's say, e to",01:04:47.290,01:04:50.070
"the square root of N, that's
not a polynomial.",01:04:50.070,01:04:53.310
"But that will also be killed by the
negative exponential, because it's",01:04:53.310,01:04:56.240
square root versus the other one.,01:04:56.240,01:04:57.950
"It just so happens that we are in the
very fortunate situation that the",01:04:57.950,01:05:01.170
"growth function is either identically
2 to the N, or else it's polynomial.",01:05:01.170,01:05:07.390
There is nothing in between.,01:05:07.390,01:05:09.440
"If you draw something that is
super polynomial and sub exponential",01:05:09.440,01:05:13.110
"and try to find the hypothesis set
for which this is a growth",01:05:13.110,01:05:16.600
"function, you will fail.",01:05:16.600,01:05:18.450
So I'm getting it for free.,01:05:18.450,01:05:20.280
"I'm just taking the simplicity
of the polynomial, because lucky for",01:05:20.280,01:05:23.270
"me, the polynomials are the
ones that come out.",01:05:23.270,01:05:25.370
And they happen to serve the purpose.,01:05:25.370,01:05:28.090
MODERATOR: OK.,01:05:28.090,01:05:29.150
"A few people are asking, could you
repeat the constraints of the puzzle?",01:05:29.150,01:05:34.240
Because they didn't get the--,01:05:34.240,01:05:35.530
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:05:35.530,01:05:36.780
Let's look at the puzzle.,01:05:39.340,01:05:40.830
I am putting 3 bits on every row.,01:05:41.470,01:05:45.130
"I'm trying to get as many different rows
as possible, under the constraint",01:05:45.130,01:05:49.300
"that if you focus on any 2 of them-- so
if I focus on x_1 and x_2 and go down",01:05:49.300,01:05:55.530
"the columns, it must be that one
of the possible patterns for",01:05:55.530,01:06:00.090
x_1 and x_2 is missing.,01:06:00.090,01:06:01.770
"Because I'm saying that 2 is
a break point, so I cannot",01:06:01.770,01:06:05.760
shatter any 2 points.,01:06:05.760,01:06:07.400
"Therefore, I cannot shatter x_1 and x_2,
among others, meaning that I cannot",01:06:07.400,01:06:12.340
get all possible patterns.,01:06:12.340,01:06:13.540
"There are only four possible patterns,
which is, if you take it as a binary",01:06:13.540,01:06:17.350
"0 0, 0 1, 1 0, 1 1.",01:06:17.350,01:06:19.480
"And I'm representing them using
the circles.",01:06:19.480,01:06:22.760
"In this case, the x_1 and x_2
get 0 0, so to speak. If I",01:06:22.760,01:06:28.920
keep adding a pattern--,01:06:28.920,01:06:31.900
So let's look at here.,01:06:31.900,01:06:33.940
"x_1 and x_2,",01:06:33.940,01:06:35.460
how many patterns do they have?,01:06:35.460,01:06:38.120
They have this pattern.,01:06:38.120,01:06:38.870
They have it again.,01:06:38.870,01:06:39.450
That doesn't count.,01:06:39.450,01:06:40.390
"So there's only one pattern
here, plus one, is two.",01:06:40.390,01:06:43.430
"So on x_1 and x_2, I have
only two patterns.",01:06:43.430,01:06:46.030
"So I haven't violated anything, because
I will be only violating if I get all",01:06:46.030,01:06:49.340
four patterns.,01:06:49.340,01:06:50.280
"So I'm OK, and similarly
for the other guys.",01:06:50.280,01:06:52.900
"Things become interesting when you
start getting the fourth row.",01:06:52.900,01:06:56.550
"Now again, if you look at the first 2
points, I get one pattern here and one",01:06:56.550,01:07:03.000
pattern here.,01:07:03.000,01:07:03.490
There are only two patterns.,01:07:03.490,01:07:04.460
"Nothing is violated as far these
2 points are concerned.",01:07:04.460,01:07:07.750
"But the constraint has to be satisfied
for any choice of 2 points.",01:07:07.750,01:07:11.610
"So if you particularly choose x_2 and x_3,
and count the number of patterns,",01:07:11.610,01:07:15.250
"you realize, 0 0,
0 1, 1 0, 1 1.",01:07:15.250,01:07:18.130
I am in trouble.,01:07:18.130,01:07:19.630
That's why we put it in red.,01:07:19.630,01:07:21.820
"Because now these guys have
all possible patterns.",01:07:21.820,01:07:25.020
"And I know, by the assumption of the
problem, that I cannot get all four",01:07:25.020,01:07:28.640
patterns on any 2 points.,01:07:28.640,01:07:30.430
So I cannot get this.,01:07:30.430,01:07:31.790
"So I'm unable to add this row
under those constraints.",01:07:31.790,01:07:35.290
"And therefore, I'm taking it away.",01:07:35.290,01:07:37.500
And I'm going through the exercise.,01:07:37.500,01:07:38.880
"And every time I put a row, I keep
an eye on all possible combinations.",01:07:38.880,01:07:43.450
"So here, I put--",01:07:43.450,01:07:44.710
let's look at x_1 and x_2.,01:07:44.710,01:07:46.450
"1 pattern, 2, 3.",01:07:46.450,01:07:49.990
I'm OK.,01:07:49.990,01:07:51.150
"x_2 and x_3, 1 pattern, which
is here and here.",01:07:51.150,01:07:54.820
"2, 3.",01:07:54.820,01:07:55.940
I'm also OK.,01:07:55.940,01:07:57.220
"And then you put x_1, x_3.",01:07:57.220,01:07:59.730
Here is a pattern.,01:07:59.995,01:08:00.830
It repeats here.,01:08:00.830,01:08:02.250
0 0 and 0 0.,01:08:02.250,01:08:05.590
So that's one.,01:08:05.590,01:08:07.000
"And then I get this one
and this one, 3.",01:08:07.000,01:08:09.340
"So this one is perfect,
everyone.",01:08:09.340,01:08:11.690
"Not perfect in any sense, except
that I didn't violate anything.",01:08:11.690,01:08:14.270
So I'm allowed to put that row.,01:08:14.270,01:08:16.279
"Now when I extend this further, and start
putting the new guys, for this",01:08:16.279,01:08:20.830
"guy, there is a violation.",01:08:20.830,01:08:22.060
"And you can scan your eyes and
try to find the violation.",01:08:22.060,01:08:24.600
And I'm highlighting it in red.,01:08:24.600,01:08:26.399
"So I'm showing you that for x_1 and
x_3, there are the four patterns.",01:08:26.399,01:08:30.049
"Here's one pattern, the second one.",01:08:30.049,01:08:32.370
"I didn't count this one, just because
it's already happened.",01:08:32.370,01:08:34.819
"So I just highlight four different ones,
and then the third one and fourth one.",01:08:34.819,01:08:39.240
"So I cannot possibly add this row,
because it violates the constraint on",01:08:39.240,01:08:42.689
these 2 points.,01:08:42.689,01:08:43.560
So I take it out and keep adding.,01:08:43.560,01:08:45.550
"Another attempt, this is the next guy.",01:08:45.550,01:08:47.859
It still violates.,01:08:47.859,01:08:48.960
Why does it violate?,01:08:48.960,01:08:49.819
For the same argument.,01:08:49.819,01:08:50.710
Look at the red guys.,01:08:50.710,01:08:51.490
You find all possible patterns.,01:08:51.490,01:08:52.520
So I cannot have it.,01:08:52.520,01:08:54.010
So we take it away.,01:08:54.010,01:08:55.100
"And then the last one that
is remaining is this guy.",01:08:55.100,01:08:57.580
"And that also doesn't work, because
it violates it for those guys.",01:08:57.580,01:09:01.310
You can look at it and verify.,01:09:01.310,01:09:02.609
"And the conclusion here is that
I cannot add anything.",01:09:02.609,01:09:04.880
So that's what I'm stuck with.,01:09:04.880,01:09:06.359
"And therefore, the number of different
rows I can get under the constraint",01:09:06.359,01:09:10.310
that 2 is a break point--,01:09:10.310,01:09:11.590
"in this case, is 4.",01:09:11.590,01:09:13.950
"Obviously, the remark I mentioned is
that maybe you can start instead of",01:09:13.950,01:09:18.880
"gradually from 0 0 0, 0 0 1,
maybe you can start",01:09:18.880,01:09:22.010
more cleverly or something.,01:09:22.010,01:09:23.800
"But however, anyway you try it, it's
sufficiently symmetric in the bits",01:09:23.800,01:09:28.029
that it doesn't make a difference.,01:09:28.029,01:09:29.109
You will be stuck with at most 4.,01:09:29.109,01:09:32.506
MODERATOR: OK.,01:09:32.988,01:09:35.180
"In the slide with the Hoeffding
inequality, does anything change when",01:09:35.180,01:09:39.399
you change--,01:09:39.399,01:09:41.050
"specifically, does a probability measure
change when you change from",01:09:41.050,01:09:43.750
a hypothesis to dichotomy?,01:09:43.750,01:09:47.649
PROFESSOR: For this one?,01:09:47.649,01:09:48.430
MODERATOR: Yeah.,01:09:48.430,01:09:48.939
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,01:09:48.939,01:09:49.370
"The idea here,",01:09:49.370,01:09:51.290
"M is the number of hypotheses, period.",01:09:51.290,01:09:55.670
So it's infinity for perceptrons.,01:09:55.670,01:09:57.310
We have to live with that.,01:09:57.310,01:09:59.060
"In our attempt to replace it with the
growth function, we are going to",01:09:59.060,01:10:02.620
"replace it by something that is not
infinite, bounded above by 2 to the N.",01:10:02.620,01:10:05.870
"As you can see, 2 to the N is not
really helpful because I have",01:10:05.870,01:10:07.870
"a positive exponential and
negative exponential.",01:10:07.870,01:10:09.640
And that's not very decisive.,01:10:09.640,01:10:12.140
"Therefore I am trying to find if I can
put a growth function-- not only put",01:10:12.140,01:10:16.220
"the growth function here, but also
show that the growth function is",01:10:16.220,01:10:18.250
"polynomial for the models
of interest",01:10:18.250,01:10:20.460
"that I have, and therefore be able to get
this to be a small quantity for",01:10:20.460,01:10:24.755
"a real learning model, like the perceptron
or the other one, neural",01:10:24.755,01:10:28.040
"networks, et cetera.",01:10:28.040,01:10:28.550
"All of these will have a polynomial
growth function, as we will see.",01:10:28.550,01:10:33.000
"So that's where the number of
hypotheses, which is M, goes to the",01:10:33.000,01:10:37.360
"number of dichotomies, which
is the growth function.",01:10:37.360,01:10:39.550
"Not a direct substitution,
as we will see.",01:10:39.550,01:10:41.110
"There are some technicalities
involved.",01:10:41.110,01:10:42.800
"But that is what gets me the right-hand
side to be a manageable right",01:10:42.800,01:10:47.210
"hand side, and goes to 0 as N grows,
which tells me that the probability of",01:10:47.210,01:10:51.790
generalization will be high.,01:10:51.790,01:10:54.560
MODERATOR: OK.,01:10:54.560,01:10:55.200
"Is there a systematic way
to find the break points?",01:10:55.200,01:10:59.750
PROFESSOR: There is.,01:10:59.750,01:11:01.390
It's not one size fits all.,01:11:01.390,01:11:06.140
"The are arguments, for example, you
can go for neural networks.",01:11:06.150,01:11:08.870
"And sometimes you find it by finding
a particular combination that you cannot",01:11:08.870,01:11:13.440
"break, and argue that this
is the break point.",01:11:13.440,01:11:16.010
"Sometimes you can argue
by--",01:11:16.010,01:11:17.640
"Let me try to find a crude estimate
for the growth function.",01:11:17.640,01:11:20.890
"Let's say the growth function
cannot be more than this.",01:11:20.890,01:11:23.730
"And then as you go by, you realize
that this is not exponential.",01:11:23.730,01:11:26.000
"So there has to be a break point
at some point.",01:11:26.000,01:11:27.830
"This would be less than 2 to the N, and
therefore will be a break point.",01:11:27.830,01:11:31.490
"So in that case, the estimate for the
break point will be just an estimate.",01:11:31.490,01:11:34.080
It will not be an exact value.,01:11:34.080,01:11:37.920
But it will a maximum.,01:11:37.920,01:11:39.020
We have a question in house.,01:11:39.020,01:11:42.280
STUDENT: Hi.,01:11:42.280,01:11:43.260
"So in this slide, the top end is the
number of testing points and the lower",01:11:43.260,01:11:47.660
end is the number of training points.,01:11:47.660,01:11:49.095
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,01:11:49.095,01:11:49.660
N is always the size of the sample.,01:11:49.660,01:11:51.610
"And it's a question of interpretation
between the two, whether that sample is",01:11:51.610,01:11:55.430
"used for testing, which means that you
have already frozen your hypothesis,",01:11:55.430,01:11:58.770
"and you are just verifying,
testing it.",01:11:58.770,01:12:00.960
"Or in the other case, you haven't
frozen your hypothesis.",01:12:00.960,01:12:03.340
"And you are using the same sample
to go around and find one.",01:12:03.340,01:12:06.640
"And you are charged for the going
around aspect by M.",01:12:06.640,01:12:10.570
"STUDENT: So let's say that our
customer gives us k sample points.",01:12:10.570,01:12:15.650
"How do we decide how many of them do
we reserve for testing points, how",01:12:15.650,01:12:19.135
many for training?,01:12:19.135,01:12:20.970
"PROFESSOR: This is
a very good point.",01:12:20.970,01:12:22.470
"There will be a lecture down the
road called validation, in which this",01:12:22.470,01:12:26.340
"is going to be addressed
very specifically.",01:12:26.340,01:12:29.060
There are rules of thumb.,01:12:29.060,01:12:30.250
"There are some mathematical results,",01:12:30.250,01:12:31.550
but there is a rule of thumb.,01:12:31.550,01:12:33.660
"There are few rules of thumb that I'm
going to say without proof, that",01:12:33.660,01:12:37.020
stood the test of time.,01:12:37.020,01:12:38.260
"And one of the rules of thumb has to
apply to, how many do we reserve, in",01:12:38.260,01:12:41.480
"order to first not to diminish the
training set very much, and still have",01:12:41.480,01:12:45.560
"a big enough test set so that
the estimate is reliable?",01:12:45.560,01:12:48.630
So this will come up.,01:12:48.630,01:12:49.600
Thank you.,01:12:49.600,01:12:51.260
There is another question.,01:12:51.260,01:12:54.780
"STUDENT: Hi, professor.",01:12:54.790,01:12:55.460
I have one question.,01:12:55.460,01:12:56.280
"So for 2 hypotheses that have the same
dichotomy, is it true that the",01:12:56.280,01:13:01.610
"in-sample error is the same
for the 2 hypotheses?",01:13:01.610,01:13:04.776
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:13:04.776,01:13:05.730
"If it has the same dichotomy, it's even
a stronger condition than this,",01:13:05.730,01:13:10.090
"because it returns exactly
the same values.",01:13:10.090,01:13:13.090
"Now the in-sample error is
the fraction of errors I",01:13:13.090,01:13:16.330
got right and wrong.,01:13:16.330,01:13:17.330
The target function is fixed.,01:13:17.330,01:13:18.680
So that is not going to change.,01:13:18.680,01:13:20.290
"So obviously, I'm going to get
the same pattern of errors.",01:13:20.290,01:13:23.400
"And if I get the same pattern of errors,
then obviously I'm getting the",01:13:23.400,01:13:26.320
"same fraction of errors,
among other things.",01:13:26.320,01:13:29.810
"Now if you're asking, for these
2 hypotheses, what is the",01:13:29.810,01:13:32.760
out-of-sample error?,01:13:32.760,01:13:33.690
"That's a different story, because for the
out-of-sample error, you take the",01:13:33.690,01:13:36.400
hypothesis in its entirety.,01:13:36.400,01:13:38.610
"So in spite of the fact that it's the
same on the set of points, it may be",01:13:38.610,01:13:41.610
"not the same on the entire input space,
which it isn't because they're",01:13:41.610,01:13:44.130
different hypotheses.,01:13:44.130,01:13:45.030
"And therefore, you get
a different E_out.",01:13:45.030,01:13:46.400
But the answer is yes.,01:13:46.400,01:13:47.230
You will get the same in-sample error.,01:13:47.230,01:13:48.410
"STUDENT: Oh, yes.",01:13:48.410,01:13:48.490
I see.,01:13:48.490,01:13:48.630
That's why I was asking.,01:13:48.630,01:13:49.380
"Because I think that the out-of-sample
error is different for 2 hypotheses.",01:13:49.380,01:13:54.950
So can we replace the M with--,01:13:54.950,01:13:56.980
PROFESSOR: Exactly.,01:13:56.980,01:13:57.350
"And the biggest technicality
in the proof--",01:13:57.350,01:14:01.010
"We were saying, we're going to
replace M by the growth function.",01:14:01.010,01:14:03.800
That's a very helpful thing.,01:14:03.800,01:14:05.600
"Now, there has to be a proof.",01:14:05.600,01:14:07.280
"And I will argue for the proof, and
the overlapping aspects, and some of this.",01:14:07.280,01:14:10.370
"The key point is, what do
I do about this fellow?",01:14:10.370,01:14:13.530
"Because when I consider the sample, this
one is very much under control.",01:14:13.530,01:14:16.860
"As you said, if I have 2 hypotheses
that are the same here, they are the",01:14:16.860,01:14:19.240
same here.,01:14:19.240,01:14:19.890
But they are not the same here.,01:14:19.890,01:14:21.500
"So the statement here depends on
E_out, depends on the whole input space.",01:14:21.500,01:14:24.350
"So how am I going to
get away with that?",01:14:24.350,01:14:25.890
"That's really the main technical
contribution for the proof.",01:14:25.890,01:14:28.750
And that will come up next time.,01:14:28.750,01:14:30.010
"STUDENT: Sure, thank you.",01:14:30.010,01:14:31.720
PROFESSOR: Sure.,01:14:31.728,01:14:34.120
MODERATOR: So--,01:14:34.120,01:14:35.180
why is it called a growth function?,01:14:35.180,01:14:37.300
PROFESSOR: A growth function.,01:14:37.300,01:14:39.820
I really--,01:14:39.820,01:14:40.410
"The person who introduced this
called it a growth function.",01:14:40.420,01:14:43.270
"I guess he called it a growth function,
because it grows, as you",01:14:43.270,01:14:47.850
"increase N. I don't think there is any
particular merit for the name.",01:14:47.850,01:14:52.800
MODERATOR: Is there--,01:14:52.800,01:14:53.975
"what is a real-life situation similar
to the one in the puzzle, where",01:14:53.975,01:14:57.360
"you realize that this break point
may be too small?",01:14:57.360,01:15:01.140
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:15:01.140,01:15:02.030
"The first order of business is to
get the break point out of the way--",01:15:02.030,01:15:05.620
"that there is a break point,",01:15:05.620,01:15:06.570
we are in business.,01:15:06.570,01:15:07.750
"Second one is, how does the value
of the break point relate to",01:15:07.750,01:15:11.500
the learning situation?,01:15:11.500,01:15:12.375
"Do I need more examples when
I have a bigger break point?",01:15:12.375,01:15:14.680
The answer is yes.,01:15:14.680,01:15:15.760
What is the estimate?,01:15:15.760,01:15:16.700
"And there's a theoretical
estimate, a bound.",01:15:16.700,01:15:18.820
Maybe the bound is too loose.,01:15:18.820,01:15:19.880
"So we'll have to find practical rules
of thumb that translate the break",01:15:19.880,01:15:24.110
point to a number of examples.,01:15:24.110,01:15:25.720
All of this is coming up.,01:15:25.720,01:15:26.990
"So the existence of the break point
means learning is feasible.",01:15:26.990,01:15:30.850
"The value of the break point tells us
the resources needed to achieve",01:15:30.850,01:15:34.090
a certain performance.,01:15:34.090,01:15:35.000
And that will be addressed.,01:15:35.000,01:15:37.252
"MODERATOR: Is there a probabilistic
statement for the Hoeffding inequality",01:15:37.252,01:15:42.090
"that is an alternative to the
case-by-case discussion on M's",01:15:42.090,01:15:45.410
growth rate in N?,01:15:45.410,01:15:48.790
"PROFESSOR: There are
alternatives to Hoeffding.",01:15:50.560,01:15:52.840
"So there are alternatives
to Hoeffding,",01:15:52.850,01:15:54.830
"and you can get different results
or emphasize different things.",01:15:54.830,01:15:59.960
I am sticking to Hoeffding.,01:15:59.960,01:16:01.650
"And I'm not indulging too much into its
derivation, or the alternatives,",01:16:01.650,01:16:05.540
"because this is a mathematical
tool that I'm borrowing.",01:16:05.540,01:16:08.750
And I'm taking it for granted.,01:16:08.750,01:16:10.680
"And I picked the one that will help
us the most, which is this one.",01:16:10.680,01:16:13.740
"So yes, there are variations.",01:16:13.740,01:16:15.630
"But I am deliberately not getting
into them, in order not",01:16:15.630,01:16:19.400
to dilute the message.,01:16:19.400,01:16:20.750
"I want people to become so incredibly
familiar and bored with this one, then",01:16:20.750,01:16:26.030
they know it cold.,01:16:26.030,01:16:26.730
"Because when we get to modify it,
including the growth function and the",01:16:26.730,01:16:30.145
"other technical points, I'd like the
base point to be completely clear in",01:16:30.145,01:16:34.330
"people's mind, so that they don't get
lost with the modifications.",01:16:34.330,01:16:36.870
So that's why I'm sticking to this.,01:16:36.870,01:16:40.345
MODERATOR: I think that's it.,01:16:40.776,01:16:42.140
PROFESSOR: Very good.,01:16:42.200,01:16:42.800
We'll see you next time.,01:16:42.800,01:16:44.050
