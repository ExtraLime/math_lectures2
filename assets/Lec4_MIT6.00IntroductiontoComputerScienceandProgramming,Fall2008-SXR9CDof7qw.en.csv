I've done in the previous",00:00:19.930,00:00:23.130
"lectures, let me set the stage
for what we've been doing, so",00:00:23.130,00:00:25.810
"we can use that to talk about
what we're going to do today.",00:00:25.810,00:00:30.080
"So far, we have the following
in our language.",00:00:30.080,00:00:35.840
"Right, we have assignment.",00:00:35.840,00:00:41.760
We have conditionals.,00:00:41.760,00:00:46.190
We have input/output.,00:00:46.190,00:00:47.520
"And we have looping
constructs.",00:00:47.520,00:00:55.350
"These are things like
FOR and WHILE loops.",00:00:55.350,00:01:00.850
"And of course we've got some
data to go with that.",00:01:00.850,00:01:04.430
"One of the things we said last
time was, with that set of",00:01:04.430,00:01:07.650
"things, the ability to give
values-- sorry, to give names",00:01:07.650,00:01:11.160
"to values-- the ability to make
decisions, the ability to",00:01:11.160,00:01:14.480
"loop as a function of that, the
ability get things in and",00:01:14.480,00:01:16.890
"out, we said that that actually
gave us a language we",00:01:16.890,00:01:21.260
said was Turing-complete.,00:01:21.260,00:01:26.640
"And that meant, in English, that
this was enough to write",00:01:26.640,00:01:30.480
any program.,00:01:30.480,00:01:32.590
"Now that's a slight lie-- or
actually in these days of",00:01:32.590,00:01:34.600
"political debates, a slight
misspeaking, a wonderful",00:01:34.600,00:01:37.890
"word-- it is technically
correct.",00:01:37.890,00:01:40.700
"It is enough to allow us to
write any program, but it's",00:01:40.700,00:01:43.310
"not enough to allow us to easily
write any program.",00:01:43.310,00:01:47.620
"And so I joked, badly, I'll
agree, at the end of last",00:01:47.620,00:01:50.990
"lecture, that we can just stop
now, go straight to the final",00:01:50.990,00:01:52.990
"exam, because this is all
you need to know.",00:01:52.990,00:01:54.700
"The point is, yes it's enough to
start with, but we want to",00:01:54.700,00:01:58.000
"add things to this that let
us problem solve well.",00:01:58.000,00:02:00.730
"And one of the things to think
about is, even though I've got",00:02:00.730,00:02:03.970
"all of that, let's think about
what I could do, if I wanted",00:02:03.970,00:02:06.730
to write a piece of code.,00:02:06.730,00:02:09.450
"Right now, you've got to
write it in one file.",00:02:09.450,00:02:11.820
"It's a long sequence of
instructions, it starts at the",00:02:11.820,00:02:14.570
"beginning, walks through, may
jump around a little bit, but",00:02:14.570,00:02:17.520
"eventually comes down
at the end.",00:02:17.520,00:02:19.830
"It's okay for the things you're
doing for the early",00:02:19.830,00:02:21.660
problem sets.,00:02:21.660,00:02:23.110
Ten lines of code.,00:02:23.110,00:02:24.320
Twenty lines of code.,00:02:24.320,00:02:25.900
"Imagine instead, you're writing
code that's a hundred",00:02:25.900,00:02:27.970
"thousand lines, a million
lines, of code.",00:02:27.970,00:02:31.130
"You don't want to write
it in this form.",00:02:31.130,00:02:34.050
"All right, and the reason you
don't want to do that is,",00:02:34.050,00:02:36.400
"well, several.",00:02:36.400,00:02:37.020
"First of all, it's really hard
to figure out where everything",00:02:37.020,00:02:39.240
"is, where everything goes,
making sure I'm",00:02:39.240,00:02:40.840
in the right place.,00:02:40.840,00:02:42.370
"To use an ancient expression
from the 1970's, which only",00:02:42.370,00:02:45.760
"John and I will appreciate, it's
really hard to grok what",00:02:45.760,00:02:48.700
"that code is doing, to
understand what it's trying to",00:02:48.700,00:02:50.950
make happen.,00:02:50.950,00:02:52.370
"And the reason that that's the
case is, what we don't have,",00:02:52.370,00:02:55.830
are two important things.,00:02:55.830,00:03:00.520
"We don't have decomposition, and
we don't have abstraction.",00:03:00.520,00:03:12.460
"And that's what we're
going to add today.",00:03:12.460,00:03:13.360
So what does that mean?,00:03:13.360,00:03:14.160
"Those are fancy terms.
Decomposition is a way of",00:03:14.160,00:03:18.880
"putting structure
onto the code.",00:03:18.880,00:03:20.710
"It's a way of breaking the
code up into modules.",00:03:20.710,00:03:23.650
"Modules that makes sense
on their own.",00:03:23.650,00:03:25.580
"Modules that we can reuse
in multiple places.",00:03:25.580,00:03:28.010
"Modules that, if you
like, isolate",00:03:28.010,00:03:29.950
components of the process.,00:03:29.950,00:03:32.960
"And abstraction is related to
that, abstraction is going to",00:03:32.960,00:03:35.550
let us suppress details.,00:03:35.550,00:03:37.980
"It's going to let us bury away
the specifics of something,",00:03:37.980,00:03:42.420
"and treat that computation
like a black box.",00:03:42.420,00:03:44.980
"And by black box, I mean,
literally behaves like a",00:03:44.980,00:03:47.420
mysterious little black box.,00:03:47.420,00:03:49.100
"You put some inputs in, it has
a contract that says if you",00:03:49.100,00:03:52.200
"put the right kind of inputs
in you'll get a specific",00:03:52.200,00:03:54.600
"output coming out, but you
don't have to know what's",00:03:54.600,00:03:57.060
inside of that box.,00:03:57.060,00:03:58.510
"And that abstraction is
really important.",00:03:58.510,00:04:01.250
"Again, imagine if I'm a writing
a piece of code.",00:04:01.250,00:04:04.960
"I want to just use it, I
shouldn't have to worry about",00:04:04.960,00:04:07.710
"what variables I use inside of
it, I have shouldn't have to",00:04:07.710,00:04:09.840
"worry about where that is in the
code, I should be able to",00:04:09.840,00:04:12.060
just abstract it away.,00:04:12.060,00:04:13.880
"And that's what we want to add
today, are those two things.",00:04:13.880,00:04:16.950
"Now, our mechanism for doing
that-- or at least one",00:04:16.950,00:04:19.770
"mechanism, I shouldn't say the
only one-- one mechanism for",00:04:19.770,00:04:23.120
"doing that is going to be to add
functions to our language.",00:04:23.120,00:04:30.810
"Now, the point of a function is
that it's going to provide",00:04:30.810,00:04:35.250
"both of these things, so the
first thing it's going to do",00:04:35.250,00:04:37.030
"is, it's going to let us
break up into modules.",00:04:37.030,00:04:44.730
"Second thing they're going to do
is let us suppress detail.",00:04:44.730,00:04:51.060
"And in essence what that does
is, the functions, and we're",00:04:51.060,00:04:53.140
"going to look at a bunch of
examples in a second, these",00:04:53.140,00:04:54.920
"functions are going to give us
a way to, in some or in one",00:04:54.920,00:04:58.560
"way of thinking about it is
to create new primitives.",00:04:58.560,00:05:00.640
"And I'm going to put those in
quotes, it's a generalization.",00:05:00.640,00:05:10.360
What do I mean by that?,00:05:10.360,00:05:12.480
"The idea of a function is, that
I'm going to capture a",00:05:12.480,00:05:14.980
common pattern of computation.,00:05:14.980,00:05:17.850
Computing square root.,00:05:17.850,00:05:18.700
"I'm going to capture it in a
piece of code, I'm going to be",00:05:18.700,00:05:21.100
"able to refer to it by a name,
and I'm going to suppress the",00:05:21.100,00:05:24.300
"details, meaning inside of that
computation, you don't",00:05:24.300,00:05:26.910
need to know what it does.,00:05:26.910,00:05:27.730
"You just need to know, if I
give it the right kind of",00:05:27.730,00:05:29.250
"input, it'll give me back an
input that satisfies the",00:05:29.250,00:05:31.850
contract that I set up.,00:05:31.850,00:05:34.320
"And that in essence says, I've
just created the equivalent of",00:05:34.320,00:05:37.555
a new primitive.,00:05:37.555,00:05:38.840
"Same way that I have
multiplication or division as",00:05:38.840,00:05:41.550
"a primitive, functions are going
to give me, or somebody",00:05:41.550,00:05:43.940
"else who wrote them for me as
part of a library, a new",00:05:43.940,00:05:46.430
"primitive that I'm going
to be able to use.",00:05:46.430,00:05:48.440
"And that gives me a lot of power
in terms of what I want",00:05:48.440,00:05:50.580
to have inside of the language.,00:05:50.580,00:05:52.680
OK.,00:05:52.680,00:05:55.520
"So, let's look at an example.",00:05:55.520,00:05:58.390
"To try to see what we're
going to do with this.",00:05:58.390,00:06:01.060
"Before I do that though, let me
try and give you an analogy",00:06:01.060,00:06:03.240
"to keep this in mind of why we
want to basically build these",00:06:03.240,00:06:06.060
"abstractions and what
we need in order to",00:06:06.060,00:06:08.310
have them work together.,00:06:08.310,00:06:10.300
"So here's the supposed
to say silly analogy.",00:06:10.300,00:06:13.520
"You can tell my jokes
are always bad.",00:06:13.520,00:06:15.030
"John's are much better, by the
way, which is why Thursday",00:06:15.030,00:06:17.090
"will be a much better lay--
a better lecture.",00:06:17.090,00:06:19.560
But here's the example.,00:06:19.560,00:06:20.380
"You've been hired by PBS to
produce a nice thirteen-hour",00:06:20.380,00:06:24.130
"documentary, or drama,
that's going to run.",00:06:24.130,00:06:28.310
"And, you know, you start by
saying, OK, thirteen hours,",00:06:28.310,00:06:32.220
"I'm going to break it up into
thirteen different chunks.",00:06:32.220,00:06:34.390
"I'm going to assign each chunk
to a different writer.",00:06:34.390,00:06:37.190
"And they're going to go off and
write that element, that",00:06:37.190,00:06:39.640
hour's worth of stuff.,00:06:39.640,00:06:41.800
"You can imagine what you get:
each hours worth of drama, if",00:06:41.800,00:06:45.620
"you like, may be great, but it
may have absolutely nothing to",00:06:45.620,00:06:49.130
"do with the other
twelve hours.",00:06:49.130,00:06:51.500
"And unless, you know, you've
been hired to do Pirandello's",00:06:51.500,00:06:54.470
"Six Characters In Search Of An
Author, this is not a great",00:06:54.470,00:06:57.420
"thing, because you
get something",00:06:57.420,00:06:58.320
that is really confusing.,00:06:58.320,00:07:00.220
"Now, what's the point
of the analogy?",00:07:00.220,00:07:01.690
"What do I need for
those writers to",00:07:01.690,00:07:03.465
all interact together?,00:07:03.465,00:07:04.910
I need a specification.,00:07:04.910,00:07:06.880
"I need a contract that says,
here's what I want in terms of",00:07:06.880,00:07:10.590
"things that you're going to take
as input, to begin your",00:07:10.590,00:07:12.960
"part of the drama, here's what
you're going to produce at the",00:07:12.960,00:07:15.450
"output, and the details
of what they do",00:07:15.450,00:07:17.610
inside are up to them.,00:07:17.610,00:07:20.050
"An idea of abstraction, that
idea of specification, is",00:07:20.050,00:07:22.580
"exactly what we want to use
inside of our functions.",00:07:22.580,00:07:25.500
"We won't make you write dramas
like Pirandello, but we're",00:07:25.500,00:07:27.520
"going to try make you at
least write good code.",00:07:27.520,00:07:29.360
"And that's we're going
to try and do.",00:07:29.360,00:07:30.450
All right.,00:07:30.450,00:07:31.790
Let's set the stage for it.,00:07:31.790,00:07:33.910
"Up on the screen, I've got--",00:07:33.910,00:07:35.890
"I commented it out, but I've
got a piece of code that",00:07:35.890,00:07:39.420
"you've seen before,
right up here.",00:07:39.420,00:07:41.640
OK?,00:07:41.640,00:07:42.440
What is that?,00:07:42.440,00:07:43.680
"It's the piece of code we wrote
for computing square",00:07:43.680,00:07:45.120
"roots, square roots of actually
perfect squares.",00:07:45.120,00:07:48.160
[UNINTELLIGIBLE],00:07:48.160,00:07:48.610
"Just to remind you what it
does, we bound x to some",00:07:48.610,00:07:51.530
"value, we set up an initial
variable called ANS or answer,",00:07:51.530,00:07:55.910
"and then we run through
a little loop.",00:07:55.910,00:07:57.960
"All right, we're-- well
actually, I should say that",00:07:57.960,00:07:59.820
"better, we first check to see,
is x greater than or equal to",00:07:59.820,00:08:02.960
"zero, if it's not, then we come
down here and we print",00:08:02.960,00:08:05.010
"something out, otherwise we run
through a little loop to",00:08:05.010,00:08:07.160
"get the answer, and then
we check it and we",00:08:07.160,00:08:09.230
spit something out.,00:08:09.230,00:08:10.700
"It does the computation,
that's fine.",00:08:10.700,00:08:13.340
"Suppose I want to compute square
roots a lot of places",00:08:13.340,00:08:16.450
in a big chunk of code.,00:08:16.450,00:08:18.490
"Right now, I have to take that
piece of code and replicate it",00:08:18.490,00:08:22.060
"everywhere I want in
my larger file.",00:08:22.060,00:08:24.830
"And I've got to worry about,
is somebody else using ANS,",00:08:24.830,00:08:27.920
"answer, as a variable, in which
case I've got to be",00:08:27.920,00:08:30.300
really careful.,00:08:30.300,00:08:30.810
"Is somebody else using
x as a variable?",00:08:30.810,00:08:32.950
"I've got to deal with a
lot of those details.",00:08:32.950,00:08:35.620
I want to abstract that.,00:08:35.620,00:08:36.600
"And the abstraction you
see, right here.",00:08:36.600,00:08:40.310
"I'm going to highlight it for
a second so you can see it.",00:08:40.310,00:08:42.580
"I want you to look at it
on the handout as well.",00:08:42.580,00:08:44.980
"This is the creation
of a function.",00:08:44.980,00:08:48.140
"And I want to describe both the
syntax, what we're doing,",00:08:48.140,00:08:51.480
"and then the semantics of
how do we use it and",00:08:51.480,00:08:53.350
what does that mean.,00:08:53.350,00:08:54.090
So.,00:08:54.090,00:08:56.320
"Here's the syntax
of the function.",00:08:56.320,00:09:01.150
"First of all, we have
a keyword. def.",00:09:01.150,00:09:04.490
"Definition or define, depending
on which sort of",00:09:04.490,00:09:07.260
"piece of history
you come from.",00:09:07.260,00:09:08.420

All right?,00:09:34.420,00:09:35.910

that name, we have an open and",00:09:35.910,00:09:41.610

"PROFESSOR ERIC GRIMSON: Ah,
we're going to come back to",00:10:36.040,00:10:36.630
this in a second.,00:10:36.630,00:10:37.310
"But the question was, do
I always need an input?",00:10:37.310,00:10:39.120
"I can have functions with no

"We're going to see an
example in a second.",00:10:46.930,00:10:48.130
Good question.,00:10:48.130,00:10:49.410
"Actually, I've got to get rid of
this candy, so since it was",00:10:49.410,00:10:51.240
"a good question, here you go.",00:10:51.240,00:10:54.700
Nice catch.,00:10:54.700,00:10:56.280
Almost. Sorry.,00:10:56.280,00:10:58.160
OK.,00:10:58.160,00:10:59.780
"No, I'm not.",00:10:59.780,00:11:00.420
I'm sorry.,00:11:00.420,00:11:00.700
"I thought you had it, and then
I've got the wrong glasses on",00:11:00.700,00:11:02.700
"and I realized you didn't,
so I will, ah come",00:11:02.700,00:11:04.560
back to that later.,00:11:04.560,00:11:05.420
What are we doing here?,00:11:05.420,00:11:06.070
"We got definition, we got name,
we got a set of formal",00:11:06.070,00:11:08.930
parameters.,00:11:08.930,00:11:09.750
Right.,00:11:09.750,00:11:10.390
"If you look at the rest of that
code, gee, it looks a lot",00:11:10.390,00:11:13.160
like what I had elsewhere.,00:11:13.160,00:11:14.900
"Of what I had outside
of it, right?",00:11:14.900,00:11:16.100
"It's running through a
similar set of loops.",00:11:16.100,00:11:18.610
"So in some sets, as long as x
has the value I want, it ought",00:11:18.610,00:11:21.130
to do the right thing.,00:11:21.130,00:11:22.770
"However, there's a couple of
other changes there that we",00:11:22.770,00:11:24.810
want to highlight.,00:11:24.810,00:11:26.280
"In particular, notice-- let me
highlight it for you, if I can",00:11:26.280,00:11:31.850
"find it with the wrong glasses
on-- we've got",00:11:31.850,00:11:34.550
these return commands.,00:11:34.550,00:11:37.860
So return is another keyword.,00:11:37.860,00:11:42.040
"And it basically says, when you
get to this point in the",00:11:42.040,00:11:48.710
"computation, stop
the computation.",00:11:48.710,00:11:52.390
"Literally, return the control
from this function, and take",00:11:52.390,00:11:56.460
"the value of the next
expression, and return that as",00:11:56.460,00:11:59.480
"the value of the whole
computation.",00:11:59.480,00:12:02.290
"Now, the one that we're most
interested in is the one",00:12:02.290,00:12:04.530
"where, in fact, it gets out ANS,
so you see down here in",00:12:04.530,00:12:07.340
"the code, there's a spot where
it's going to return the value",00:12:07.340,00:12:10.310
"of ANS, which is what
we want, right?",00:12:10.310,00:12:12.370
"That's the thing that holds the
value that we intended to",00:12:12.370,00:12:14.440
have.,00:12:14.440,00:12:15.940
"But there's another couple of
places in that code where it's",00:12:15.940,00:12:17.950
"got this funky-looking thing,
return none, and notice none's",00:12:17.950,00:12:20.910
in a different color.,00:12:20.910,00:12:22.830
"None is a special value, and
it has the following",00:12:22.830,00:12:33.830
"slightly-odd behavior: it is
a value, we can return it--",00:12:33.830,00:12:38.300
"God bless-- but what none says
is, there is no value coming",00:12:38.300,00:12:42.460
back from this computation.,00:12:42.460,00:12:44.220
"So when it is returned, and
we'll see this in a second, to",00:12:44.220,00:12:46.670
"the interpreter, it
doesn't print.",00:12:46.670,00:12:49.180
OK.,00:12:49.180,00:12:49.870
"It simply doesn't
print anything.",00:12:49.870,00:12:51.150
"Nonetheless, it is actually a
value and we can use it, for",00:12:51.150,00:12:53.950
"example, to do comparisons.",00:12:53.950,00:12:55.860
"If we want to know, did this
function return a value or",00:12:55.860,00:12:58.250
"not, rather than reserving, say,
-1 or some other special",00:12:58.250,00:13:01.620
"thing which you might want to
use some other ways, it",00:13:01.620,00:13:03.380
"literally returns this very
special value that says, there",00:13:03.380,00:13:05.740
"is no actual value return
from this computation.",00:13:05.740,00:13:09.740
OK.,00:13:09.740,00:13:11.480
"Note, by the way, if I chase
through each possible path,",00:13:11.480,00:13:15.270
"like there's some IFs in here,
there's some places to go, at",00:13:15.270,00:13:18.790
"least in this piece of code,
every possible path through",00:13:18.790,00:13:21.340
this code ends in a return.,00:13:21.340,00:13:23.800
"And that's a good programming
discipline, to",00:13:23.800,00:13:25.700
make sure that happens.,00:13:25.700,00:13:27.020
"There's an exception, which
we'll see in a second, but",00:13:27.020,00:13:28.900
"I'll highlight, which is, if
we get to the end of the",00:13:28.900,00:13:30.940
"procedure, there's sort of
an implicit return there.",00:13:30.940,00:13:34.170
"In fact, a return of
none, in that case.",00:13:34.170,00:13:36.140
It comes out of it.,00:13:36.140,00:13:36.750
"But if I look at this, right?",00:13:36.750,00:13:38.060
"If I come into this code, I'm
going to check this branch",00:13:38.060,00:13:41.040
"first, if it's not true, ah,
there's a return at the end of",00:13:41.040,00:13:43.790
that branch.,00:13:43.790,00:13:44.660
"If it is true, I do that, and
then I've got a second test.",00:13:44.660,00:13:48.460
"If it's true, I return,
otherwise a return.",00:13:48.460,00:13:50.830
"So there's a return branch
on every possible",00:13:50.830,00:13:52.960
path through the code.,00:13:52.960,00:13:54.350
"And that's valuable, it's
something you want to think",00:13:54.350,00:13:55.870
about as your right your own.,00:13:55.870,00:13:59.120
OK.,00:13:59.120,00:14:00.820
"What do I do to use this,
in particular?",00:14:00.820,00:14:04.140
How do I invoke this?,00:14:04.140,00:14:07.160
"OK, so I'm going to invoke a
function by passing in values",00:14:07.160,00:14:17.880
for the parameters.,00:14:17.880,00:14:24.100
"And in this case, that literally
means typing sqrt,",00:14:24.100,00:14:29.770
"with some value inside
the parens.",00:14:29.770,00:14:34.650
OK.,00:14:34.650,00:14:36.030
"Now, let's just try this out
to see what happens.",00:14:36.030,00:14:38.050
"I'm going to make sure I've got
it there, so if I type,",00:14:38.050,00:14:42.440
"for example, sqrt
of 16, ah-ha!",00:14:42.440,00:14:50.470
What did it do?,00:14:50.470,00:14:51.680
"Well, let's talk about
what it did.",00:14:51.680,00:14:53.130
"What this invocation does, is
the following: it binds, and",00:14:53.130,00:14:58.810
"I'm going to say this
specifically for this example,",00:14:58.810,00:15:01.460
"rather than general,
it binds x to 16.",00:15:01.460,00:15:06.680
"Just as you would have done with
an assignment statement",00:15:06.680,00:15:09.120
up in the top level thing.,00:15:09.120,00:15:10.740
But this binding is local.,00:15:10.740,00:15:16.130
"Meaning it only holds within
the confines of the code of",00:15:16.130,00:15:19.810
this procedure.,00:15:19.810,00:15:22.000
"Relative to that, think of that
as creating what we, I'm",00:15:22.000,00:15:24.520
"going to call a new
environment.",00:15:24.520,00:15:25.700
"Relative to that, it does all
the other execution we would",00:15:25.700,00:15:28.960
"do, including, notice the first
instruction there is to",00:15:28.960,00:15:30.990
the set up a binding for ANS.,00:15:30.990,00:15:32.920
"So answer, or ANS, is also
bound only locally.",00:15:32.920,00:15:42.410
"Meaning, inside the
confines of this",00:15:42.410,00:15:44.460
environment of this procedure.,00:15:44.460,00:15:46.280
"ANS starts off with a value of
0 and now we just run through",00:15:46.280,00:15:49.310
"that loop just like
we did before.",00:15:49.310,00:15:50.530
"Writing Increments it slowly,
checking to see if ANS squared",00:15:50.530,00:15:53.680
"is bigger than x, and when it
gets to that point, it checks",00:15:53.680,00:15:56.020
"to see, is it actually a perfect
square or not, and it",00:15:56.020,00:15:58.210
returns it.,00:15:58.210,00:15:58.730
"And once it returns it, it
returns a value from that",00:15:58.730,00:16:02.340
"return, that in this case
is just printed out.",00:16:02.340,00:16:06.250
All right.,00:16:06.250,00:16:07.300
"Now I want to say a
couple of things",00:16:07.300,00:16:08.550
about these local bindings.,00:16:08.550,00:16:10.920
"I'm going to repeat this
a second time,",00:16:10.920,00:16:12.310
because it's important.,00:16:12.310,00:16:16.400
"These local bindings do not
affect any global bindings.",00:16:16.400,00:16:28.680
What does that mean?,00:16:28.680,00:16:30.590
"Let me show you a little
example, and then we'll come",00:16:30.590,00:16:32.700
back to this.,00:16:32.700,00:16:34.240
"I've got a little
function here.",00:16:34.240,00:16:36.980
"See, I've defined f of x to be
a function that takes a value",00:16:36.980,00:16:40.670
"of x in, changes x to x+1, and
then just returns the value.",00:16:40.670,00:16:45.060
OK.,00:16:45.060,00:16:45.260
So it's just adding 1 to x.,00:16:45.260,00:16:47.290
"But I want you to see now what
happens if I use this.",00:16:47.290,00:16:49.940
"Let's bind x to the
value of 3.",00:16:49.940,00:16:53.580
"It's creating a binding for x
in this global environment.",00:16:53.580,00:16:56.710
"This is what the interpreter
sees.",00:16:56.710,00:16:57.890
All right?,00:16:57.890,00:16:58.850
"In fact, if I look at
x, its value is 3.",00:16:58.850,00:17:01.710
"Let's bind z eh let's bind z
to the-- if I could type it",00:17:01.710,00:17:08.260
"would help-- say, f of 3.",00:17:08.260,00:17:15.780
OK?,00:17:15.780,00:17:16.260
"So the value is z is 4, it's
what I expect, right?",00:17:16.260,00:17:20.420
"Locally x got bound to 3, I
added 1 to it, whoop-dee-doo,",00:17:20.420,00:17:22.820
I get back a 4.,00:17:22.820,00:17:24.030
But what's the value of x?,00:17:24.030,00:17:27.540
It's still 3.,00:17:27.540,00:17:29.650
"The way to think of this is,
again, I've got multiple",00:17:29.650,00:17:32.380
"scopes, or multiple frames, or
if we're going to come back to",00:17:32.380,00:17:35.430
"those terms, I'm going to use
the word environment, because",00:17:35.430,00:17:37.060
"I'm an old-time Lisp hacker,
multiple environments in which",00:17:37.060,00:17:39.750
there are bindings.,00:17:39.750,00:17:40.810
"So let me spell this out in just
a little bit more detail.",00:17:40.810,00:17:44.680
"What this is saying
is the following.",00:17:44.680,00:17:55.760
"When I'm talking to the
interpreter, when I'm typing",00:17:55.760,00:17:57.890
"things in as I just did, to that
Python environment, I'm",00:17:57.890,00:18:01.600
"getting what I'm going to
call global bindings.",00:18:01.600,00:18:03.970
"I'm going to draw a
little chart here.",00:18:03.970,00:18:15.220
"Think of this as the, as the
world of the interpreter, in",00:18:15.220,00:18:17.610
"that I've got things like x
bound to the value of 3.",00:18:17.610,00:18:23.750
"When I call or invoke a
function, think of it as",00:18:23.750,00:18:30.980
creating a local table.,00:18:30.980,00:18:41.160
"Inside that local table, I bind
the formal parameter,",00:18:41.160,00:18:47.330
"which is what I do I did
16 right to some value.",00:18:47.330,00:18:51.970
This x only gets seen by sqrt.,00:18:51.970,00:18:55.630
"Inside of there, I can bind
other things, like ANS gets",00:18:55.630,00:18:59.050
"locally bound to 0, and then
it increments around and",00:18:59.050,00:19:02.330
"eventually we return
that value out.",00:19:02.330,00:19:04.520
"When I get to a return from
sqrt, some value is returned",00:19:04.520,00:19:09.340
"back to the interpreter, and
that table goes away.",00:19:09.340,00:19:14.760
"But that table does not affect
any bindings for other",00:19:14.760,00:19:18.190
"instances of the variable
like x for ANS.",00:19:18.190,00:19:22.620
OK.,00:19:22.620,00:19:24.320
"Let's look at a couple of
examples, just to sort of",00:19:24.320,00:19:26.320
stress that.,00:19:26.320,00:19:27.090
"And one of the things I
wanted to show is, OK.",00:19:27.090,00:19:33.970
"Again, I can now use a function
just as if it was a",00:19:33.970,00:19:37.110
"primitive, so this is just an
assignment and I going to take",00:19:37.110,00:19:39.260
"test to be the value of that, of
course nothing gets printed",00:19:39.260,00:19:42.270
"because that was an assignment
statement.",00:19:42.270,00:19:43.850
All right?,00:19:43.850,00:19:44.010
"So if I called sqrt alone, that
return value is done, but",00:19:44.010,00:19:47.100
"in this case I bound it to
test, so I can go look at",00:19:47.100,00:19:49.190
"test, and there it is.",00:19:49.190,00:19:51.720
What happens if I do that?,00:19:51.720,00:19:58.810
OK.,00:19:58.810,00:19:59.160
"If you look at the code, it
printed out, it's not a",00:19:59.160,00:20:00.910
"perfect square, which is what I
wanted, but now, what's the",00:20:00.910,00:20:03.350
value of test?,00:20:03.350,00:20:05.720
"OK, I bound test to something,
if I look at it, it doesn't",00:20:05.720,00:20:09.230
"print anything, but--
if I could type--",00:20:09.230,00:20:15.550
"I can ask, is test bound to
that special name none?",00:20:15.550,00:20:20.080
The answer is yes.,00:20:20.080,00:20:23.130
"Boy, this seems like
a nuance, right?",00:20:23.130,00:20:24.570
But it's a valuable thing.,00:20:24.570,00:20:25.760
"It says, in each case, I return
some useful value from",00:20:25.760,00:20:30.880
this procedure.,00:20:30.880,00:20:31.520
"I can check it, so if this
was part of some other",00:20:31.520,00:20:33.270
"computation, I want to
know, did it find a",00:20:33.270,00:20:35.800
perfect square or not?,00:20:35.800,00:20:36.700
"I don't have to go read what it
printed out in the screen.",00:20:36.700,00:20:39.830
"This has returned a value
that I can use.",00:20:39.830,00:20:41.480
"Because I could do a test to
say, is this a return value?",00:20:41.480,00:20:44.190
"If it's not, I'll do something
else with it.",00:20:44.190,00:20:46.730
"So the binding is still
there, it simply",00:20:46.730,00:20:48.280
doesn't print it out.,00:20:48.280,00:20:51.030
OK.,00:20:51.030,00:20:51.400
What do we have out of this?,00:20:51.400,00:20:53.910
"Simple, seems like,
at least addition.",00:20:53.910,00:20:56.700
"We've added this notion
of a function.",00:20:56.700,00:20:59.960
"I've highlighted some of the key
things we got here, right?",00:20:59.960,00:21:02.090
"We have that def keyword, we've
got a name, we've got a",00:21:02.090,00:21:04.740
"list-- or I shouldn't say
a word list, we have a",00:21:04.740,00:21:06.440
"collection of formal parameters
that we're going to",00:21:06.440,00:21:08.260
"use-- we have a body, and the
body looks just like the",00:21:08.260,00:21:11.500
"normal instructions we'd use,
although by the way, we ought",00:21:11.500,00:21:13.640
"to be able to use functions
inside the body, which we're",00:21:13.640,00:21:15.830
"going to do in a second, and
then we're going to simply",00:21:15.830,00:21:18.365
"return some values
out of this.",00:21:18.365,00:21:20.460
"Now I started by saying,
build these functions.",00:21:20.460,00:21:23.330
"I'm trying to get both
decomposition and abstraction.",00:21:23.330,00:21:27.840
"Well, you hopefully can see
the decomposition, right?",00:21:27.840,00:21:29.910
I now have a module.,00:21:29.910,00:21:30.970
"OK, let me set the stage.",00:21:30.970,00:21:33.020
"Imagine I wanted to do sqrt, or
square root-- no, I'm going",00:21:33.020,00:21:35.410
"to use sqrt, that's the name I'm
using here-- square root a",00:21:35.410,00:21:37.710
"hundred different places
in some piece of code.",00:21:37.710,00:21:40.550
"Without function, I'd have to
copy that piece of code",00:21:40.550,00:21:43.650
everywhere.,00:21:43.650,00:21:44.660
"Now I got one just simple
thing, and I simply have",00:21:44.660,00:21:47.730
"isolated that module inside
of that function.",00:21:47.730,00:21:51.650
What about abstraction?,00:21:51.650,00:21:53.550
"Well, I've got part of what
I want for abstraction.",00:21:53.550,00:21:56.300
"Abstraction, again, says I'm
going to suppress details.",00:21:56.300,00:21:58.570
"Now that I've written sqrt, I
can just use it anywhere I",00:21:58.570,00:22:01.430
want in the code.,00:22:01.430,00:22:02.780
"You've got to rely on the fact
that I wrote it correctly, but",00:22:02.780,00:22:05.000
"you can basically suppress the
details of how it's used.",00:22:05.000,00:22:08.380
"There's one more piece that we'd
like to get out of that,",00:22:08.380,00:22:10.640
"and that is-- you may have been
wondering, what's with",00:22:10.640,00:22:13.180
"the funky stuttering here of
three double-quotes in a row.",00:22:13.180,00:22:17.140
All right?,00:22:17.140,00:22:17.410
And that is a specification.,00:22:17.410,00:22:20.640
"Which is a really valuable
thing to have.",00:22:20.640,00:22:22.280
"So what is the specification
going to do?",00:22:22.280,00:22:24.250
"It is my place, as a programmer,
to write",00:22:24.250,00:22:28.740
information to the user.,00:22:28.740,00:22:30.890
"This is me writing one hour of
that episode of Pirandello and",00:22:30.890,00:22:33.750
"telling the other authors,
here's what I'm assuming as",00:22:33.750,00:22:36.560
you use it.,00:22:36.560,00:22:37.910
"So it's up to me to do it right,
but if I do it, I'm",00:22:37.910,00:22:39.810
"going to specify, what does
this function do?",00:22:39.810,00:22:42.660
"What does it expect as input,
and any other information I",00:22:42.660,00:22:45.200
want to pass on.,00:22:45.200,00:22:46.710
"And notice, by the way, if I
do that, I'm going to come",00:22:46.710,00:22:49.360
"down here, and I type sqrt and
open the paren, ah-ha!",00:22:49.360,00:22:56.240
"It shows me what the creator, in
this case actually I stole",00:22:56.240,00:23:00.090
"this from John so what Professor
Guttag put up as his",00:23:00.090,00:23:02.740
"specification for this
piece of code.",00:23:02.740,00:23:06.220
"Now, it's not guaranteed
it's right, right?",00:23:06.220,00:23:07.630
"You're trusting the programmer
did it right, but this now",00:23:07.630,00:23:10.110
tells you something.,00:23:10.110,00:23:10.820
What is this?,00:23:10.820,00:23:11.310
"This is a wonderful piece
of abstraction.",00:23:11.310,00:23:13.050
"It is saying, you don't need
to know squat about what's",00:23:13.050,00:23:16.040
"inside the body of
this function.",00:23:16.040,00:23:18.250
"You don't have to worry about
the parameter names, because",00:23:18.250,00:23:19.980
"they're going to be preserved,
you don't need to worry about",00:23:19.980,00:23:21.490
"how I'm doing it, this tells you
how you can use this, in",00:23:21.490,00:23:24.530
order to use it correctly.,00:23:24.530,00:23:26.560
"Of course, I can then close
it off, and off we go.",00:23:26.560,00:23:30.230
"All right, so that notion of
abstraction and I was going to",00:23:30.230,00:23:32.360
"come back-- we're going to come
back to multiple times",00:23:32.360,00:23:34.700
"during the term-- and it's not
just abstraction, it's the",00:23:34.700,00:23:37.320
idea of a specification.,00:23:37.320,00:23:39.430
"And just to look ahead a little
bit, you could easily",00:23:39.430,00:23:41.270
"imagine that I might want to
not just put a statement in",00:23:41.270,00:23:43.630
"there, what the specs are,
I might want to put some",00:23:43.630,00:23:45.780
constraints.,00:23:45.780,00:23:46.830
"Some specific things to check
for, to make sure that you're",00:23:46.830,00:23:49.450
calling the code right.,00:23:49.450,00:23:50.780
"And it becomes a powerful way of
reasoning about the code, a",00:23:50.780,00:23:53.710
"powerful way of using the code,
so those notions of",00:23:53.710,00:23:55.940
specs are really important.,00:23:55.940,00:23:58.960
"Look, part of the reason I'm
flaming at you is, something",00:23:58.960,00:24:03.540
"like square root, it seems dumb
to write specs on it.",00:24:03.540,00:24:05.830
"Everybody knows what this
is going to do.",00:24:05.830,00:24:07.570
"But you want to get into that
discipline of good hygiene,",00:24:07.570,00:24:10.380
good style.,00:24:10.380,00:24:10.880
"You want to write the specs so
that everybody does in fact",00:24:10.880,00:24:13.970
"know what this piece of code is
doing, and you're writing",00:24:13.970,00:24:15.880
it each time around.,00:24:15.880,00:24:18.870
OK.,00:24:18.870,00:24:20.230
"Now that we've got functions,
let's see what we can do as a",00:24:20.230,00:24:25.690
"problem-solving tool
using them.",00:24:25.690,00:24:27.720
"In a particular, I've already
said I want to get this notion",00:24:27.720,00:24:29.810
"of modularity, it's a module I
can isolate, and I want to get",00:24:29.810,00:24:32.730
"the notion of abstracting away
the details, let's see how we",00:24:32.730,00:24:35.980
"can actually use that to
actually write some reasonably",00:24:35.980,00:24:39.230
"interesting pieces of code, but
in particular, to see how",00:24:39.230,00:24:42.480
"we can use it to capture the
ideas of decomposition and",00:24:42.480,00:24:45.970
abstraction.,00:24:45.970,00:24:47.660
So I'm going to shift gears.,00:24:47.660,00:24:49.070
Start with a simple problem.,00:24:49.070,00:24:57.310
"Boy, we're suddenly be
transported to Nebraska.",00:24:57.310,00:24:59.520
"Or where I grew up,
Saskatchewan.",00:24:59.520,00:25:01.550
"All right, we've got
a farm air problem.",00:25:01.550,00:25:03.550
"I got a farmer, walks out into
his yard, one morning.",00:25:03.550,00:25:07.300
"This farmer has a bunch of pigs
in a punch-- it's been a",00:25:07.300,00:25:10.896
"long day-- a bunch of pigs
and a bunch of chickens.",00:25:10.896,00:25:14.120
"And he walks out into the
farmyard and he observes 20",00:25:14.120,00:25:17.740
heads and 56 legs.,00:25:17.740,00:25:22.470
"And for sake of argument, there
are no amputees among",00:25:22.470,00:25:26.970
the chickens and the pigs.,00:25:26.970,00:25:28.980
"And the question is, so how many
pigs does he have, and",00:25:28.980,00:25:31.160
how many chickens does he have?,00:25:31.160,00:25:33.630
Wow.,00:25:33.630,00:25:34.480
"What a deep problem, right?",00:25:34.480,00:25:36.440
"But you're going to see
why we're going to",00:25:36.440,00:25:37.200
use this in a second.,00:25:37.200,00:25:37.910
"So you know how to solve
this, this is a",00:25:37.910,00:25:39.280
"fifth-grade problem, right?",00:25:39.280,00:25:40.370
"And what's the way
to solve this?",00:25:40.370,00:25:41.930
System of linear equations.,00:25:41.930,00:25:43.790
What are the equations here?,00:25:43.790,00:25:44.820
"Well, I could say, you know,
the number of pigs plus the",00:25:44.820,00:25:48.880
"number of chickens
equals 20, right?",00:25:48.880,00:25:53.570
Because we've got 20 heads.,00:25:53.570,00:25:54.750
And then what else do I have?,00:25:54.750,00:25:55.730
"Four times the number of pigs
plus two times the number of",00:25:55.730,00:26:00.470
"chickens, assuming they're
not next to a",00:26:00.470,00:26:02.590
"nuclear reactor, is 56.",00:26:02.590,00:26:07.700
"And then how would
you solve this?",00:26:07.700,00:26:10.270
"Well, it's, you sort of know
how you'd do it if this was",00:26:10.270,00:26:11.910
grammar school right?,00:26:11.910,00:26:12.860
"You'd pull out your pencil and
paper, you can do it as a",00:26:12.860,00:26:14.830
"matrix inversion if you know
how to do that, or you can",00:26:14.830,00:26:16.740
"just simply do substitution
of one equation into",00:26:16.740,00:26:19.360
another to solve it.,00:26:19.360,00:26:21.270
"That's certainly one way to do
it, but for computers that's",00:26:21.270,00:26:24.100
"not necessarily the
easiest way.",00:26:24.100,00:26:26.870
"So another way of solving it is
to do something we already",00:26:26.870,00:26:29.110
"saw last time, which is
basically, why not simply",00:26:29.110,00:26:31.910
"enumerate all possible examples
and check them?",00:26:31.910,00:26:35.240
"You could say, I could have
zero chickens and 20 pigs,",00:26:35.240,00:26:39.120
does that work?,00:26:39.120,00:26:40.110
"I've got one chicken and
nineteen pigs, does that work?",00:26:40.110,00:26:41.910
"I've got two chickens
and eighteen",00:26:41.910,00:26:43.050
"pigs, you get the idea.",00:26:43.050,00:26:44.460
"So I'm going to solve this by
enumerate and check, which is",00:26:44.460,00:26:52.050
"an example of what's called
a brute-force algorithm.",00:26:52.050,00:27:00.840
"Meaning, I'm just going
to write a little",00:27:00.840,00:27:02.010
loop that does that.,00:27:02.010,00:27:03.700
"All right, so let's go
back to our code.",00:27:03.700,00:27:07.440
"That's right, let me pull
this over a little bit,",00:27:07.440,00:27:10.030
so I can see it.,00:27:10.030,00:27:14.320
"And what I'd like you to look
at, I'm going to highlight it",00:27:14.320,00:27:16.110
"just for a second here, is
those two pieces of code.",00:27:16.110,00:27:19.800
OK?,00:27:19.800,00:27:20.240
Let's start with solve.,00:27:20.240,00:27:24.170
OK.,00:27:24.170,00:27:24.610
Here's the idea of solve.,00:27:24.610,00:27:25.580
"I'm going to have it take in as
input how many legs I got,",00:27:25.580,00:27:28.520
"how many heads do I have,
and I just want to",00:27:28.520,00:27:30.640
write a little loop.,00:27:30.640,00:27:32.160
OK.,00:27:32.160,00:27:32.320
"I know how to do that, right?",00:27:32.320,00:27:34.270
"Write a little loop, all
I'm going to do, is",00:27:34.270,00:27:36.580
run a FOR loop here.,00:27:36.580,00:27:37.660
"I'm going to let the number of
chickens be in this range.",00:27:37.660,00:27:40.910
"Remember what range does, it
gives me a set or a collection",00:27:40.910,00:27:43.730
"or a tuple of integers from 0
up to 1 - is the last value,",00:27:43.730,00:27:48.010
"so it's going to give me
everything from 0 up to the",00:27:48.010,00:27:49.770
total number of heads.,00:27:49.770,00:27:51.730
"Knowing that, I'm going to say,
OK, how many pigs are",00:27:51.730,00:27:53.310
"there, well that's just how
we're, however many I had",00:27:53.310,00:27:55.040
"total, minus that amount, and
then I can see, how many legs",00:27:55.040,00:27:58.290
"does that give, and then I can
check, that the number of legs",00:27:58.290,00:28:01.190
"that I would get for that
solution, is it even equal to",00:28:01.190,00:28:03.300
"the number of legs I
started with, ah!",00:28:03.300,00:28:06.330
Interesting.,00:28:06.330,00:28:06.910
A return.,00:28:06.910,00:28:08.640
"In particular, I'm going
to return a tuple.",00:28:08.640,00:28:10.890
"So, a pair or collection
of those two values.",00:28:10.890,00:28:14.420
"If it isn't, then I'm going to
go back around the loop, and",00:28:14.420,00:28:17.390
notice what happens.,00:28:17.390,00:28:18.220
"If I get all the way around the
loop, that is, all the way",00:28:18.220,00:28:22.100
"through that FOR loop and I
never find a path that takes",00:28:22.100,00:28:24.830
"me through here, then the last
thing I'm going to do is",00:28:24.830,00:28:27.350
"return a pair or a tuple
with a special",00:28:27.350,00:28:30.520
simple number none twice.,00:28:30.520,00:28:32.260
Yep.,00:28:32.260,00:28:32.630
"Are you telling me I want
parens there and",00:28:32.630,00:28:35.870
"not, and not braces?",00:28:35.870,00:28:36.910
All right.,00:28:36.910,00:28:37.650
"I hate this language, because I
always want to have parens.",00:28:37.650,00:28:40.380
"Every time you see a square
bracket, put a paren in.",00:28:40.380,00:28:42.360
All right?,00:28:42.360,00:28:44.750
"Thank you, Christy.",00:28:44.750,00:28:45.850
I'll get it eventually .,00:28:45.850,00:28:48.250
"Having done that, right,
notice what I've got.",00:28:48.250,00:28:51.050
"First of all, two parameters.",00:28:51.050,00:28:53.930
It's OK.,00:28:53.930,00:28:54.760
"All it says is, when I call
this, I need to pass in two",00:28:54.760,00:28:56.910
parameters for this to work.,00:28:56.910,00:28:58.650
All right?,00:28:58.650,00:29:00.100
"Now, if I want to use that,
I'm going to use a second",00:29:00.100,00:29:02.370
"piece of code here,
called Barnyard.",00:29:02.370,00:29:03.540
"I'm going to read in a couple
of values, convert them into",00:29:03.540,00:29:06.310
"integers, and then I'm
going to use solve to",00:29:06.310,00:29:09.735
get a solution out.,00:29:09.735,00:29:11.630
"And what do I know
about solve?",00:29:11.630,00:29:12.910
"It is going to give me back a
tuple a collection of two",00:29:12.910,00:29:16.130
"things, and so check
out the syntax.",00:29:16.130,00:29:19.280

will get bound to the two",00:29:19.280,00:29:22.780
parts of that return tuple.,00:29:22.780,00:29:25.550
"OK, pigs will be the first part,
chickens will be the",00:29:25.550,00:29:27.550
second part.,00:29:27.550,00:29:29.010
"OK, and then once I've got that,
well, notice: I can then",00:29:29.010,00:29:31.620
"check to see, did I return
that special symbol none?",00:29:31.620,00:29:35.450
Is the first part.,00:29:35.450,00:29:36.190
"That says, I took the branch
through here that eventually",00:29:36.190,00:29:38.450
"got to the end and said, there
wasn't a solution, in which",00:29:38.450,00:29:41.540

"going to print out, there ain't
no solution, otherwise",00:29:41.886,00:29:44.170
I'll print out the pieces.,00:29:44.170,00:29:47.030
"All right, let's check it out.",00:29:47.030,00:29:51.130
"Ah, what did I say?",00:29:51.130,00:29:51.890
"Twenty and 56, Right?",00:29:51.890,00:29:54.800
"OK, notice the form.",00:29:54.800,00:29:57.300
"I've got two parameters, they're
separated by a comma.",00:29:57.300,00:30:02.930
"Ah, right.",00:30:02.930,00:30:05.460
Sorry?,00:30:05.460,00:30:09.160
"Yeah, but I see-- it's legs and
heads, but it should not",00:30:09.160,00:30:12.350
still have--,00:30:12.350,00:30:16.790
"Oh, sorry.",00:30:16.790,00:30:17.490
Thank you.,00:30:17.490,00:30:18.160

wrong thing.",00:30:18.160,00:30:19.490

I had looked when I opened",00:30:19.490,00:30:24.420

me a closed paren with no",00:30:24.420,00:30:26.500

so you can see how",00:30:27.610,00:30:29.640
well I can fix from these?,00:30:29.640,00:30:30.740
All right.,00:30:30.740,00:30:31.020
"Now I call that, and it says,
tell me how many heads you",00:30:31.020,00:30:33.550
"want, give it a 20, and tell
it how many legs you want,",00:30:33.550,00:30:37.086

out the answers.",00:30:37.086,00:30:43.190
"I know, whoop-dee-doo.",00:30:43.190,00:30:43.930
"But notice what's
inside if here.",00:30:43.930,00:30:45.570
"First of all, notice
the modularity.",00:30:45.570,00:30:47.420
I've used solve.,00:30:47.420,00:30:48.830
All right?,00:30:48.830,00:30:50.820
Right there.,00:30:50.820,00:30:51.500
"I've captured it as
a computation.",00:30:51.500,00:30:53.790
"It's buried away, all the
details are suppressed.",00:30:53.790,00:30:57.720
"I can use that to return values,
which I can then use",00:30:57.720,00:31:00.150
"elsewhere, which I did-- and
if I just come back and",00:31:00.150,00:31:02.330
"highlight this-- inside
of that computation.",00:31:02.330,00:31:05.480
"But I don't have to know, inside
of Barnyard, what the",00:31:05.480,00:31:08.950
"values are used inside
of solve.",00:31:08.950,00:31:11.430
"I don't know what the names of
the variables are, I don't",00:31:11.430,00:31:13.290
"care, I can basically suppress
away that detail.",00:31:13.290,00:31:17.380
"Second thing we saw is, that
using this as a computation, I",00:31:17.380,00:31:20.360
can return multiple values.,00:31:20.360,00:31:22.030
"Which is actually of
real value to me",00:31:22.030,00:31:23.380
here as I use that.,00:31:23.380,00:31:25.810
OK.,00:31:25.810,00:31:26.710
Yeah.,00:31:26.710,00:31:27.040
Question.,00:31:27.040,00:31:27.360
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:31:27.360,00:31:38.480
PROFESSOR ERIC GRIMSON: Ah.,00:31:38.480,00:31:39.192
"The question was, when it
returns, how does it",00:31:39.192,00:31:41.050
"distinguish between local
and other things?",00:31:41.050,00:31:42.770
So let me try and answer that.,00:31:42.770,00:31:43.940
"Inside of solve, solve creates
an environment where inside of",00:31:43.940,00:31:47.960
"that, it has bindings for the
parameters it's going to use.",00:31:47.960,00:31:50.600
All right?,00:31:50.600,00:31:51.330
"Like, number of-- wait, what
did we call a were solve--",00:31:51.330,00:31:54.150
"number of legs and
number of heads.",00:31:54.150,00:31:56.560
"OK, those are bound locally.",00:31:56.560,00:31:58.090
"When solve is done, it wraps up,
if you like, a value that",00:31:58.090,00:32:02.110
it returns.,00:32:02.110,00:32:03.510
Which is that.,00:32:03.510,00:32:04.800
"That expression, or that
value, or that value,",00:32:04.800,00:32:09.370
"literally gets passed back out
of that local environment to",00:32:09.370,00:32:12.930
"the value that comes
back out of it.",00:32:12.930,00:32:14.700
"So in particular, what's solved
returns is a pair.",00:32:14.700,00:32:18.570
"It could be the pair of none,
none, it could be the pair of,",00:32:18.570,00:32:22.210
"you know, whatever the answer
was that we put up there.",00:32:22.210,00:32:24.820
"That value comes back out and
is now available inside the",00:32:24.820,00:32:28.260
scope of Barnyard.,00:32:28.260,00:32:30.730
OK.,00:32:30.730,00:32:31.740
And Barnyard then uses that.,00:32:31.740,00:32:33.800
Question?,00:32:33.800,00:32:34.190
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:32:34.190,00:32:39.990
PROFESSOR ERIC GRIMSON: Here?,00:32:39.990,00:32:40.270
"So the question is, why is this
return on the same level",00:32:40.270,00:32:42.300
as the FOR?,00:32:42.300,00:32:43.460
Why do you think?,00:32:43.460,00:32:43.990
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:32:43.990,00:32:56.520
PROFESSOR ERIC GRIMSON: No.,00:32:56.520,00:32:56.894
Good question.,00:32:56.894,00:32:57.110
All right?,00:32:57.110,00:32:57.380
"So what's going to
happen here?",00:32:57.380,00:32:58.990
"If I'm inside this FOR, OK, and
I'm running around, if I",00:32:58.990,00:33:02.690
"ever hit a place where this
test is true, I'm going to",00:33:02.690,00:33:06.400
"execute that return,
that return returns",00:33:06.400,00:33:08.790
from the entire procedure.,00:33:08.790,00:33:11.330
OK?,00:33:11.330,00:33:11.850
"So the return comes back
from the procedure.",00:33:11.850,00:33:13.860
"So the question was, why is
this return down at this",00:33:13.860,00:33:17.250
"level, it says, well if I ever
execute out of this FOR loop,",00:33:17.250,00:33:20.130
"I get to the end of the FOR
loop without hitting that",00:33:20.130,00:33:22.020
"branch that took me through the
return, then and only then",00:33:22.020,00:33:25.480
"do I want to actually say,
gee, I got to this place,",00:33:25.480,00:33:28.410
"there isn't any value to return,
I'm going to return",00:33:28.410,00:33:30.050
none and none.,00:33:30.050,00:33:31.780
"I'm still trying to get rid
of this candy, Halloween's",00:33:31.780,00:33:33.660
"coming, where were we?",00:33:33.660,00:33:34.560
"There's one, thank you.",00:33:34.560,00:33:36.120
"I don't think I'm going
to make it, I did.",00:33:36.120,00:33:38.680
Thank you.,00:33:38.680,00:33:41.030
Make sense?,00:33:41.030,00:33:48.540
"The answer is no, I want parens
to create tuple and I",00:33:48.540,00:33:51.240
"get really confused about
the difference",00:33:51.240,00:33:52.630
between lists and tuples.,00:33:52.630,00:33:53.700
"For now, the code is working.",00:33:53.700,00:34:00.550
"Yes is the answer, all right?",00:34:00.550,00:34:02.560
"And we're having a difference
of opinion as to whether we",00:34:02.560,00:34:04.450
"should use a tuple or
a list here, right?",00:34:04.450,00:34:06.610
"But the answer is
yes, you can.",00:34:06.610,00:34:08.300
"And my real answer is, go try it
out, because obviously you",00:34:08.300,00:34:10.630
"can tell I frequently do this
the wrong way and the TAs give",00:34:10.630,00:34:12.960
me a hard time every time.,00:34:12.960,00:34:13.970

"PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: As you'll
see next week, tuples",00:34:18.730,00:34:21.020
"and lists are very close
to the same thing.",00:34:21.020,00:34:23.620
"In almost any place where you
can get away with using tuples",00:34:23.620,00:34:27.740
you can use lists.,00:34:27.740,00:34:29.460
PROFESSOR ERIC GRIMSON: Yes.,00:34:29.460,00:34:29.680
"PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG: But
want to emphasize word is",00:34:29.680,00:34:31.350
"almost, because we'll see a
couple of places where if it",00:34:31.350,00:34:34.970
"expects a tuple and you
use a list you'll",00:34:34.970,00:34:37.290
get an error message.,00:34:37.290,00:34:38.980

that next week.",00:34:38.980,00:34:40.950
"PROFESSOR ERIC GRIMSON: Right,
when the real pro comes in to",00:34:40.950,00:34:43.030
"pick up the pieces I'm leaving
behind for him.",00:34:43.030,00:34:46.500

here by the way is, you",00:34:51.260,00:34:53.610

this example?",00:35:17.830,00:35:18.860
"I want to show you how easy
it is to change the code.",00:35:18.860,00:35:20.630
"But, notice, once I've
added this I",00:35:20.630,00:35:22.130
actually have a problem.,00:35:22.130,00:35:22.820

problem.",00:35:22.820,00:35:24.560
"I have more unknowns than
I have equations.",00:35:24.560,00:35:28.530

actually solve this.",00:35:28.530,00:35:30.700

to change my code?",00:35:33.190,00:35:35.840
"And the answer is fortunately
not a lot.",00:35:35.840,00:35:38.610

look now at this set of",00:35:38.610,00:35:41.010

1 and Barnyard 1.",00:35:41.010,00:35:45.590

1 it looks much the",00:35:47.040,00:35:49.110
same as it did for Barnyard.,00:35:49.110,00:35:50.630
"Right, I'm going to read in the
values of the number of",00:35:50.630,00:35:52.480
heads and the number of legs.,00:35:52.480,00:35:53.760

before, but now I'm going to",00:35:53.760,00:35:56.280
bind out three variables.,00:35:56.280,00:35:58.170

a similar thing to",00:35:58.170,00:35:59.540
print things out.,00:35:59.540,00:36:01.020

"Right, how would I solve
this problem?",00:36:06.240,00:36:07.820
"You can use the same enumerate

"gee let me pick how many
pigs there are.",00:36:10.970,00:36:13.730

of spiders there are.",00:36:14.970,00:36:18.370

in place, I now know how",00:36:21.980,00:36:25.880
"many pigs I must have
and I can run",00:36:25.880,00:36:27.470
through the same solution.,00:36:27.470,00:36:28.490

is this is another very",00:36:28.490,00:36:31.800
standard structure.,00:36:31.800,00:36:32.550
I now have two nested loops.,00:36:32.550,00:36:35.480
"One running through a choice for
one parameter, another one",00:36:35.480,00:36:38.590
"running through a choice
for a second parameter.",00:36:38.590,00:36:40.630
"And then the rest
of the solution",00:36:40.630,00:36:41.800

10?,00:37:22.240,00:37:24.550
All right.,00:37:24.550,00:37:24.880

"Let's just for the
heck of it --",00:37:26.670,00:37:27.990

better examples",00:37:27.990,00:37:29.520
before I tried this.,00:37:29.520,00:37:37.720

"OK, so what have I done?",00:37:40.230,00:37:41.060
"I just added a little
bit more now.",00:37:41.060,00:37:42.220
"I'm now running through
a pair of loops.",00:37:42.220,00:37:43.620

that nice",00:37:43.620,00:37:45.480
"abstraction going on, which
is what I want.",00:37:45.480,00:37:48.450
"Once I get to this stage though
by the way, there might",00:37:48.450,00:37:50.340
be more than one solution.,00:37:50.340,00:37:51.740
"Because in an under-constrained
problem",00:37:51.740,00:37:53.920
"there could be multiple
solutions.",00:37:53.920,00:37:55.610
"So suppose I want to capture
all of them or",00:37:55.610,00:37:57.620
print all of them out.,00:37:57.620,00:37:59.060
"Well I ought to be able
to do that by simply",00:37:59.060,00:38:00.920
generalizing the loop.,00:38:00.920,00:38:02.710
"And that's what the next
piece of code on your a",00:38:02.710,00:38:07.320
hand out shows you.,00:38:07.320,00:38:08.550

you look at this.",00:38:08.550,00:38:09.810

going to run through the same",00:38:09.810,00:38:13.360
"kind of loop, printing out
all of the answers.",00:38:13.360,00:38:16.050
But it's going to keep going.,00:38:16.050,00:38:17.260

return when it finds one, it's",00:38:17.260,00:38:19.670
"going to run through
all of them.",00:38:19.670,00:38:22.410
All right?,00:38:22.410,00:38:23.270
"Sounds like a reasonable
thing to do.",00:38:23.270,00:38:24.330

through all possible answers,",00:38:26.000,00:38:30.020

gee, what if",00:38:30.020,00:38:31.480
there aren't any answers?,00:38:31.480,00:38:32.430
How do I return that case?,00:38:32.430,00:38:35.130
"And that shows you one other
nice little thing we want to",00:38:35.130,00:38:37.230
"do, which is if I look in this
code notice I set up a",00:38:37.230,00:38:40.510
"variable up here called Solution
Found, initially",00:38:40.510,00:38:42.890
bound to false.,00:38:42.890,00:38:44.760
"The rest of that code's
a pair of loops.",00:38:44.760,00:38:47.110
Pick the number of spiders.,00:38:47.110,00:38:48.110
Pick the number of chickens.,00:38:48.110,00:38:49.000
"That sets up the
number of pigs.",00:38:49.000,00:38:50.250
Figure out the legs.,00:38:50.250,00:38:51.020
See if it's right.,00:38:51.020,00:38:52.200

print out the information but",00:38:52.200,00:38:55.200
"I'm also going to change
that variable to true.",00:38:55.200,00:38:58.720

end of that pair of loops",00:38:58.720,00:39:01.620

right here, I can check to see",00:39:01.620,00:39:05.440

not in that case print out",00:39:05.440,00:39:08.980
there is no solution.,00:39:08.980,00:39:11.040

piece which is I can now look",00:39:11.040,00:39:14.320
"for first solution, I can look
for all solutions, and I can",00:39:14.320,00:39:17.140
"maintain some internal variables
that let me know",00:39:17.140,00:39:20.010
what I found.,00:39:20.010,00:39:20.670

use a lot as you write your",00:39:20.670,00:39:22.770

the last 10 minutes with",00:39:24.880,00:39:27.140
"a different variation on how
to use functions to think",00:39:27.140,00:39:30.210
about problems. And that is to,00:39:30.210,00:39:32.510
introduce the idea of recursion.,00:39:32.510,00:39:35.890
"How many of you have heard
the term used before?",00:39:35.890,00:39:44.240

used before in terms of",00:39:44.240,00:39:48.020
programming languages?,00:39:48.020,00:39:50.180
Great.,00:39:50.180,00:39:51.040
"For the rest you,
don't sweat it.",00:39:51.040,00:39:52.380
"This is a highfalutin term that
computer scientists use",00:39:52.380,00:39:55.170
"to try and make them look like
they're smarter than they",00:39:55.170,00:39:57.010
really are.,00:39:57.010,00:39:58.810
"But it is a very handy way of
thinking about, not just how",00:39:58.810,00:40:01.910
"to program, but how to
break problems down",00:40:01.910,00:40:04.710
into nice sized chunks.,00:40:04.710,00:40:06.880
"And the idea behind recursion
I'm going to describe with a",00:40:06.880,00:40:09.640
simple example.,00:40:09.640,00:40:11.310
"And then I'm going to show you
how we can actually use it.",00:40:11.310,00:40:16.720
"The idea of recursion is that
I'm going to take a problem",00:40:16.720,00:40:20.310
"and break it down into a simpler
version of the same",00:40:20.310,00:40:23.000
"problem plus some steps
that I can execute.",00:40:23.000,00:40:26.930

"function, in a second.",00:40:28.590,00:40:29.450
"But let me give you actually
an analogy.",00:40:29.450,00:40:32.830
"If you look at US law, and you
look at the definition of the",00:40:32.830,00:40:37.080
"US legal code that defines
the notion of a",00:40:37.080,00:40:39.040
natural born US citizen.,00:40:39.040,00:40:41.130
"It's actually a wonderful
recursive definition.",00:40:41.130,00:40:43.850
So what's the definition?,00:40:43.850,00:40:45.240
"If you're born in the United
States you are by definition a",00:40:45.240,00:40:49.950
natural born US citizen.,00:40:49.950,00:40:51.680
We call that a base case.,00:40:51.680,00:40:58.140
"It's basically the
simplest possible",00:40:58.140,00:41:05.030
solution to the problem.,00:41:05.030,00:41:07.180
"Now if you were not born in
the United States, you may",00:41:07.180,00:41:09.660
"still be, under definition, a
natural born US citizen if",00:41:09.660,00:41:14.150
"you're born outside this United
States, both of your",00:41:14.150,00:41:16.900
"parents are citizens of the
United States and at least one",00:41:16.900,00:41:19.780
"parent has lived in
the United States.",00:41:19.780,00:41:21.880
"There's a wonderful
legal expression.",00:41:21.880,00:41:24.450
But notice what that is.,00:41:24.450,00:41:25.570
It's a recursive definition.,00:41:25.570,00:41:26.830
"How do you know that your
parents, at least one of your",00:41:26.830,00:41:30.580
"parents satisfies
the definition?",00:41:30.580,00:41:32.840
"Well I've reduced the problem
from am I a natural born US",00:41:32.840,00:41:36.970
"citizen to is one
of my parents a",00:41:36.970,00:41:39.780
natural born US citizen?,00:41:39.780,00:41:41.280
"And that may generalize again
and it keeps going until you",00:41:41.280,00:41:44.070
"either get back to Adam
and Eve, I guess.",00:41:44.070,00:41:46.830
"I don't think they were born in
the US as far as I know, or",00:41:46.830,00:41:49.740
"you find somebody who satisfies
that definition or",00:41:49.740,00:41:52.320
"you find that none
of your parents",00:41:52.320,00:41:54.490
actually are in that category.,00:41:54.490,00:41:55.920
"But that second one is called
the inductive step, or the",00:41:55.920,00:42:00.540
recursive step.,00:42:00.540,00:42:01.630
"And in my words it says break
the problem into a simpler",00:42:01.630,00:42:10.340
"version of the same problem
and some other steps.",00:42:10.340,00:42:28.550
"And I think this is best
illustrated by giving you a",00:42:28.550,00:42:31.090
simple little piece of code.,00:42:31.090,00:42:33.350

about in other ways.,00:42:41.010,00:42:42.320

right as right to left.,00:42:48.170,00:42:50.580
OK?,00:42:50.580,00:42:51.890

"And if they are, then oh,
I just need to know is",00:43:12.210,00:43:14.800

notice what I just did.",00:43:19.030,00:43:21.020

version of the same problem.",00:43:23.320,00:43:27.080

would solve all instances",00:43:27.080,00:43:30.970

what I just described will",00:43:30.970,00:43:34.560
solve the larger size one.,00:43:34.560,00:43:36.940

I have. I would like you",00:43:36.940,00:43:39.300

call it s, binds it locally,",00:43:46.500,00:43:51.360

"PROFESSOR ERIC GRIMSON: Right,
we're going to do that in a",00:48:10.690,00:48:11.275
"second, but the answer is
Fibonacci numbers, we define",00:48:11.275,00:48:13.910
the first two.,00:48:13.910,00:48:14.680

Sorry John.,00:48:35.140,00:48:36.290
"The answer is Fibonacci actually
was actually trying",00:48:36.290,00:48:38.450
"to count rabbits back
in the 1200s.",00:48:38.450,00:48:40.570
"The idea was that rabbits could
mate after a month, at",00:48:40.570,00:48:43.400
age one month.,00:48:43.400,00:48:44.580
"And so he said, if you start off
with a male and a female,",00:48:44.580,00:48:47.380
"at the end of one month they
have an offspring.",00:48:47.380,00:48:49.700
"Let's assume they have
two offspring.",00:48:49.700,00:48:52.040
"At the end of the next month
let's assume those offspring",00:48:52.040,00:48:54.130
have offspring.,00:48:54.130,00:48:54.680
Again a male and female.,00:48:54.680,00:48:55.620
"The question was how many
rabbits do you have at",00:48:55.620,00:48:57.550
the end of a year?,00:48:57.550,00:48:58.160
At the end of two years?,00:48:58.160,00:48:58.860
"At the end of more than that
number of years, and so.",00:48:58.860,00:49:01.470
"We can do this with the
following level definition.",00:49:01.470,00:49:05.950
"We're going to let pairs of 0,
the number of pairs at month",00:49:05.950,00:49:08.320
"0, actually it would not
be 0 it would be 1.",00:49:08.320,00:49:10.200
"We let the number of pairs
at month 1 be 1.",00:49:10.200,00:49:17.650
"And then the number of pairs
at month n is the number of",00:49:17.650,00:49:21.920
"pairs at month n - 1 plus
the number of pairs",00:49:21.920,00:49:25.880
at month n - 2.,00:49:25.880,00:49:27.670
The sum of the previous two.,00:49:27.670,00:49:30.910
"If I write Fibonacci, you
see it right there.",00:49:30.910,00:49:35.350
"And the reason I want to show
you this is to notice that the",00:49:35.350,00:49:37.390
recursion can be doubled.,00:49:37.390,00:49:39.490
"So this says, given a value x,
if it's either 0 or 1, either",00:49:39.490,00:49:43.570
"of those two cases,
just return 1.",00:49:43.570,00:49:45.830
"Otherwise break this down
into two versions",00:49:45.830,00:49:49.260
of a simpler problem.,00:49:49.260,00:49:50.860
"Fib of x - 1 and fib of x - 2,
and then take the sum of those",00:49:50.860,00:49:54.870
and return that as the value.,00:49:54.870,00:49:57.470
"Notice if I'm going to have two
different sub problems I",00:49:57.470,00:50:01.120
"need to have two base cases
here to catch this.",00:50:01.120,00:50:04.690
"And if I only had one
it would error out.",00:50:04.690,00:50:06.200
"And as a consequence, I can go
off and ask about rabbits.",00:50:06.200,00:50:11.730
Let's see.,00:50:11.730,00:50:13.760
"At the end of 12 months,
not so bad.",00:50:13.760,00:50:18.350
"At the end of two years, we're
not looking so good.",00:50:18.350,00:50:24.990
"At the end of three years,
we are now in Australia.",00:50:24.990,00:50:30.790
Overrun with rabbits.,00:50:30.790,00:50:31.860
"In fact I don't think the thing
ever comes back, so I'm",00:50:31.860,00:50:34.460
"going to stop it because it
really gets hung up here.",00:50:34.460,00:50:37.580
And I'm going to restart it.,00:50:37.580,00:50:40.490
What's the point of this?,00:50:40.490,00:50:42.260
"Again, now that I can think
about things recursively, I",00:50:42.260,00:50:44.600
"can similarly break things down
into simpler versions of",00:50:44.600,00:50:47.410
the same problem.,00:50:47.410,00:50:48.660
It could be one version.,00:50:48.660,00:50:49.770
It could be multiple versions.,00:50:49.770,00:50:51.090
"And we're going to come back
throughout the term to think",00:50:51.090,00:50:53.810
"about how to code programs
that reflect this.",00:50:53.810,00:50:56.910
"The last point I want to make
to you is, you've started",00:50:56.910,00:50:59.090
"writing programs that you
would think of as being",00:50:59.090,00:51:01.140
inherently iterative.,00:51:01.140,00:51:02.010
"They're running through
a loop.",00:51:02.010,00:51:04.180
"It's a common way of thinking
about problems. Some problems",00:51:04.180,00:51:07.290
"are naturally tackled
that way.",00:51:07.290,00:51:09.410
"There are other problems that
are much more naturally",00:51:09.410,00:51:11.710
"thought of in a recursive
fashion.",00:51:11.710,00:51:13.900
"And I would suggest palindrome
as a great example of that.",00:51:13.900,00:51:16.390
"That's easy to think
about recursively.",00:51:16.390,00:51:18.440
"It's much harder to think
about iteratively.",00:51:18.440,00:51:20.620
"And you want to get into the
habit of deciding which is the",00:51:20.620,00:51:22.940
right one for you to use.,00:51:22.940,00:51:24.890
"And with that, we'll
see you next time.",00:51:24.890,00:51:27.070
