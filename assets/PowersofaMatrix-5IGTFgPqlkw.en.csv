"PROFESSOR: Hi, and welcome.",00:00:08.320,00:00:10.134
"Today, we're going
to do a problem",00:00:10.134,00:00:11.550
about powers of a matrix.,00:00:11.550,00:00:15.630
"Our problem is first to find
a formula for the k-th power",00:00:15.630,00:00:21.270
"of this matrix C. This is
a two by two matrix that",00:00:21.270,00:00:24.510
depends on variables a and b.,00:00:24.510,00:00:27.834
"And the second
part of our problem",00:00:27.834,00:00:29.250
"is to calculate C to the
100th in the special case",00:00:29.250,00:00:34.210
where a and b are -1.,00:00:34.210,00:00:38.710
"You can hit pause now,
and I'll give you a minute",00:00:38.710,00:00:40.840
to do the problem yourself.,00:00:40.840,00:00:42.990
"And then, I'll come back
and we can do it together.",00:00:42.990,00:00:45.210
OK.,00:00:57.620,00:00:58.720
We're back.,00:00:58.720,00:01:00.220
"Now, what's the first step in
finding powers of a matrix?",00:01:00.220,00:01:05.980
"Well, we need to find the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors",00:01:05.980,00:01:09.130
of this matrix.,00:01:09.130,00:01:10.900
So how do we do that?,00:01:10.900,00:01:13.030
"We compute the determinant of
C minus lambda I, which is just",00:01:13.030,00:01:22.840
"the determinant of this matrix:
2b minus a minus lambda,",00:01:22.840,00:01:35.090
"2b minus 2a; a minus b, and
2a minus b minus lambda.",00:01:35.090,00:01:47.320
OK.,00:01:47.320,00:01:48.780
"If you compute this, well, we
have a lambda squared term.",00:01:48.780,00:01:54.940
OK.,00:01:54.940,00:01:56.760
"Our lambda term,
if you look at it,",00:01:56.760,00:01:59.500
"you'll see we get 2b
minus a plus 2a minus b,",00:01:59.500,00:02:06.800
which is just a plus b.,00:02:06.800,00:02:08.470
And we have a negative sign.,00:02:08.470,00:02:10.680
"And it's negative a
plus b times lambda.",00:02:10.680,00:02:15.080
"And our last term is a
little tougher to compute.",00:02:15.080,00:02:18.930
So I'll let you do it yourself.,00:02:18.930,00:02:21.040
"But you're just going
to get plus a*b.",00:02:21.040,00:02:25.390
"And this will factor as lambda
minus a times lambda minus b.",00:02:25.390,00:02:32.390
"So our eigenvalues
are just a and b.",00:02:32.390,00:02:38.820
"Now we need to find
our eigenvectors.",00:02:38.820,00:02:41.370
So how do we do that?,00:02:41.370,00:02:43.720
"Well, what we need
to do is we need",00:02:43.720,00:02:46.170
"to look at C minus a
times the identity.",00:02:46.170,00:02:51.230
"And we need to find the
null space of this matrix.",00:02:51.230,00:02:54.770
So what do we get here?,00:02:54.770,00:02:58.360
We get 2b minus 2a.,00:02:58.360,00:03:02.010
"And then our next entry here,
we get 2a minus b minus a.",00:03:07.330,00:03:13.080
So this is a minus b.,00:03:13.080,00:03:15.810
Good.,00:03:15.810,00:03:16.850
"So you can see that this
matrix has the same columns",00:03:16.850,00:03:27.310
and the same rows.,00:03:27.310,00:03:30.740
"And so you can see that a
vector in the null space,",00:03:30.740,00:03:37.670
"since this column is
-2 times this column,",00:03:37.670,00:03:43.690
"we can see that our first
eigenvector is just-- or 1, 2,",00:03:43.690,00:03:48.370
I should say.,00:03:48.370,00:03:51.050
"It's just [1, 2].",00:03:51.050,00:03:54.964
Good.,00:03:54.964,00:03:55.464
"Well, I guess we have space
to do the second one too.",00:03:58.220,00:04:02.280
Why not?,00:04:02.280,00:04:04.950
"So let's write out
the second one also.",00:04:04.950,00:04:08.780
"Here, we're subtracting
b instead of a.",00:04:08.780,00:04:11.976
You get b minus a.,00:04:11.976,00:04:14.020
You get 2b minus 2a.,00:04:14.020,00:04:17.620
We get a minus b.,00:04:17.620,00:04:20.870
And what do we have here?,00:04:20.870,00:04:22.430
We have 2a minus 2b.,00:04:22.430,00:04:25.071
"So now, what's in the
null space of this matrix?",00:04:28.400,00:04:33.000
"Well, what you can see
is that this column",00:04:33.000,00:04:40.780
is -1 times that column.,00:04:40.780,00:04:43.090
"So our second eigenvector
is just going to be [1, 1].",00:04:43.090,00:04:50.910
"And I should remind you that
if you have a harder example,",00:04:50.910,00:04:54.020
"you can just find these
null spaces by elimination",00:04:54.020,00:04:57.750
like we always do.,00:04:57.750,00:04:59.490
Great.,00:04:59.490,00:05:00.040
"Now we have our eigenvalues
and our eigenvectors.",00:05:00.040,00:05:02.610
"So now we can write C
in a nice easy way that",00:05:02.610,00:05:05.400
allows us to take powers of it.,00:05:05.400,00:05:09.810
So what's that way?,00:05:09.810,00:05:11.300
"So that's C equals
S lambda S inverse.",00:05:11.300,00:05:21.060
"So this is just, what is S?",00:05:21.060,00:05:24.910
"Remember, S is our
matrix of eigenvectors.",00:05:24.910,00:05:29.750
"So S is the matrix 1, 2; 1, 1.",00:05:29.750,00:05:36.700
Good.,00:05:36.700,00:05:37.680
Now what is lambda?,00:05:37.680,00:05:39.250
"Lambda is the matrix
of eigenvalues.",00:05:39.250,00:05:40.951
Right?,00:05:40.951,00:05:41.450
So it's just a and b.,00:05:41.450,00:05:44.360
"Those are the diagonal
entries of my lambda matrix.",00:05:44.360,00:05:49.330
"And then, we just
find S inverse.",00:05:49.330,00:05:53.110
"So we just take
negative signs here",00:05:53.110,00:05:58.040
"and recall that we have to
divide by the determinant.",00:05:58.040,00:06:05.340
"And the determinant of
this matrix is just -1.",00:06:05.340,00:06:10.840
"So we just change
the signs there.",00:06:10.840,00:06:13.080
Good.,00:06:13.080,00:06:13.680
"So this is our nice
decomposition of C.",00:06:13.680,00:06:18.310
Now how do we take powers of C?,00:06:18.310,00:06:20.740
"Well, C to the k is just S
lambda to the k S inverse.",00:06:20.740,00:06:25.820
"[1, 1; 2, 1]; a to the k,
b to the k; [-1, 1; 2, -1].",00:06:28.360,00:06:39.040
Good.,00:06:39.040,00:06:40.020
"And multiplying these
matrices together,",00:06:40.020,00:06:46.820
"just do a little
arithmetic here.",00:06:46.820,00:06:49.110
"Got a bunch of
powers of a and b.",00:06:54.660,00:06:56.880
"Because we take powers
of the eigenvalues.",00:06:56.880,00:07:02.040
"We have here, we have 2 b
to the k minus a to the k.",00:07:02.040,00:07:09.050
"Have a to the k
minus b to the k.",00:07:09.050,00:07:12.540
2 b to the k minus 2 a to the k.,00:07:15.390,00:07:20.820
"And finally, we get 2 a
to the k minus b to the k.",00:07:20.820,00:07:27.800
"And this is our
k-th power matrix.",00:07:27.800,00:07:30.540
Good.,00:07:33.213,00:07:33.713
A quick check.,00:07:36.560,00:07:37.305
"It's always good to
check your work here.",00:07:37.305,00:07:39.900
Let's plug in k equals 1.,00:07:39.900,00:07:42.880
And what do we get?,00:07:42.880,00:07:43.880
"We get 2b minus a, a minus b,
2b minus 2a, and 2a minus b.",00:07:43.880,00:07:51.080
"And if we can go all the
way back to our matrix",00:07:51.080,00:07:53.410
"at the very beginning,
all the way back here,",00:07:53.410,00:07:57.160
"that agrees perfectly
with what we started with.",00:07:57.160,00:08:00.550
So that's good.,00:08:00.550,00:08:02.250
"That means that we did
this decomposition right.",00:08:02.250,00:08:05.300
Good.,00:08:05.300,00:08:05.810
"So now, we've computed the
k-th power of this matrix.",00:08:05.810,00:08:09.160
Let's do a particular example.,00:08:09.160,00:08:13.750
So let's plug in a and b are -1.,00:08:13.750,00:08:18.380
So a equals b equals -1.,00:08:18.380,00:08:22.470
And k equals 100.,00:08:22.470,00:08:25.690
Then what do we get?,00:08:25.690,00:08:27.240
"Well, -1 to the 100th is just 1.",00:08:27.240,00:08:31.060
"So we're just plugging in 1
for b to the k and a to the k",00:08:31.060,00:08:34.830
everywhere.,00:08:34.830,00:08:35.950
"And we just get, in this
case, C to the 100th is just",00:08:35.950,00:08:42.049
"[1, 0; 0, 1].",00:08:42.049,00:08:45.420
It's just the identity matrix.,00:08:45.420,00:08:49.160
Great.,00:08:49.160,00:08:51.720
Great.,00:08:51.720,00:08:52.290
OK.,00:08:52.290,00:08:52.790
"Now to summarize, how do
we take powers of a matrix?",00:08:52.790,00:08:57.800
"Well, first we diagonalize.",00:08:57.800,00:08:59.940
"We write our matrix
as S lambda S inverse.",00:08:59.940,00:09:02.980
"And then, we just take powers
of the diagonal matrix.",00:09:02.980,00:09:06.358
