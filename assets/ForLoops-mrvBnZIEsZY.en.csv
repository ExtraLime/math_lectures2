"PROFESSOR: So now we
have this last exercise.",00:00:23.830,00:00:27.880
I'm creating a mysum.,00:00:27.880,00:00:30.310
"I'm going to go through
all of these values",00:00:30.310,00:00:32.327
"and you guys have already
told me what values these are,",00:00:32.327,00:00:34.660
"5, 7, 9, not 11.",00:00:34.660,00:00:39.640
And I'm going to add to mysum.,00:00:39.640,00:00:41.440
"So I'm going to keep a running
sum adding all of these values",00:00:41.440,00:00:44.320
together.,00:00:44.320,00:00:47.090
"So the very first time
through the loop, mysum",00:00:47.090,00:00:51.010
gets the value of 5.,00:00:51.010,00:00:55.410
That's this line here.,00:00:55.410,00:00:57.480
"The next thing I see inside
this loop is an if statement.",00:00:57.480,00:01:01.280
If mysum is equal to 5.,00:01:01.280,00:01:03.510
That's true.,00:01:03.510,00:01:06.330
"So I'm going to go
inside this if statement.",00:01:06.330,00:01:08.840
The next thing I see is a break.,00:01:08.840,00:01:10.430
"If I see this break
am I evaluating--",00:01:13.220,00:01:15.300
"am I evaluating
this line or not?",00:01:15.300,00:01:18.180
"No, exactly.",00:01:18.180,00:01:19.600
"Because whenever Python sees
break, it's going to say,",00:01:19.600,00:01:23.990
"I'm going to stop right
here, exit out of the loop",00:01:23.990,00:01:26.510
"that I'm currently in, and
go to the statement that's",00:01:26.510,00:01:29.960
immediately right after it.,00:01:29.960,00:01:32.220
"So what this is going
to print is mysum.",00:01:32.220,00:01:34.820
"And that's the exercise
we were looking at.",00:01:34.820,00:01:37.280
Let's see how the class did.,00:01:37.280,00:01:39.000
Pretty good.,00:01:41.491,00:01:41.990
"Hopefully if you
answered one of these,",00:01:45.370,00:01:48.450
"the explanation
was-- was all right.",00:01:48.450,00:01:50.370
"If not, just go back and try to
work through it step by step.",00:01:50.370,00:01:54.410
