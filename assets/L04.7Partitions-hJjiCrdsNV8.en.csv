"We now come to our last major
class of counting problems.",00:00:00.780,00:00:04.520
"We will count the number of ways
that a given set can be",00:00:04.520,00:00:07.170
"partitioned into pieces
of given sizes.",00:00:07.170,00:00:10.760
"We start with a set
that consists",00:00:10.760,00:00:13.770
of n different elements.,00:00:13.770,00:00:17.540
And we have r persons.,00:00:17.540,00:00:20.300
"We want to give n1 items to
the first person, give n2",00:00:20.300,00:00:28.960
"items to the second
person, and so on.",00:00:28.960,00:00:34.780
"And finally, we want
to give n-sub-r",00:00:34.780,00:00:38.310
items to the rth person.,00:00:38.310,00:00:42.230
"These numbers, n1, n2, up to nr
are given to us, how many",00:00:42.230,00:00:47.510
items each person should get.,00:00:47.510,00:00:49.920
"And these numbers must add to
n so that every item in the",00:00:49.920,00:00:56.140
"original set is given
to some person.",00:00:56.140,00:00:59.380
"We want to count to the number
of ways that this can be done.",00:00:59.380,00:01:04.629
"This is the number of ways that
we can partition a given",00:01:04.629,00:01:08.150
"set into subsets of
prescribed sizes.",00:01:08.150,00:01:12.650
"Let's use c to denote
the number of",00:01:12.650,00:01:15.160
ways this can be done.,00:01:15.160,00:01:16.910
"We want to calculate
this number c.",00:01:16.910,00:01:19.620
"Instead of calculating directly,
we're going to use",00:01:19.620,00:01:22.730
"the same trick that we employed
when we counted",00:01:22.730,00:01:26.400
"combinations and derived the
binomial coefficient.",00:01:26.400,00:01:30.170
"That is, we're going to
consider, in a much simpler",00:01:30.170,00:01:33.229
"counting problem, the problem
of ordering n items, taking",00:01:33.229,00:01:37.840
"the n items in our original
set and putting them in an",00:01:37.840,00:01:42.289
ordered list.,00:01:42.289,00:01:44.380
"Of course, we know in how many
ways this can be done.",00:01:44.380,00:01:48.560
"Ordering n items can be done
in n factorial ways.",00:01:48.560,00:01:54.170
"This is the count
of the number of",00:01:54.170,00:01:55.590
permutations of n items.,00:01:55.590,00:01:57.960
"But now let us think of a
different way of ordering the",00:01:57.960,00:02:00.990
"n items, an indirect way.",00:02:00.990,00:02:03.150
"It proceeds according to
the following stages.",00:02:03.150,00:02:06.250
We start with the n items.,00:02:06.250,00:02:08.340
"And we first distribute them
to the different persons.",00:02:08.340,00:02:14.410
"Having done that, then we ask
person one to take their",00:02:14.410,00:02:19.993
"items, order them, and put
them in the first n1",00:02:19.993,00:02:25.079
slots of our list.,00:02:25.079,00:02:28.390
"Then person two takes their
items and puts them into the",00:02:28.390,00:02:33.950
next n2 slots in our list.,00:02:33.950,00:02:37.430
We continue this way.,00:02:37.430,00:02:38.920
"And finally, the last person
takes the items that they",00:02:38.920,00:02:41.970
"possess and puts them
in the last n-sub-r",00:02:41.970,00:02:45.890
slots in this list.,00:02:45.890,00:02:48.685
"In how many ways can this
process be carried out?",00:02:51.810,00:02:56.050
"We have c choices on how
to partition the",00:02:56.050,00:03:01.060
given set into subsets.,00:03:01.060,00:03:04.200
"Then person one has n1 factorial
choices on how to",00:03:04.200,00:03:12.170
"order the n1 items that
that person processes.",00:03:12.170,00:03:16.570
"Person two has n2 factorial
choices for how to order the",00:03:16.570,00:03:21.140
"n2 items that it possesses,
and so on until the last",00:03:21.140,00:03:25.410
"person, who has nr factorial
choices for",00:03:25.410,00:03:30.200
ordering their elements.,00:03:30.200,00:03:33.230
"This multi-stage process results
in an ordered list of",00:03:33.230,00:03:37.680
the n terms.,00:03:37.680,00:03:39.860
"This is the number of ways these
multi-stage process can",00:03:39.860,00:03:42.780
be carried out.,00:03:42.780,00:03:44.770
"On the other hand, we know that
the number of possible",00:03:44.770,00:03:48.250
"orderings of the items
is n factorial.",00:03:48.250,00:03:51.520
So we have this equality.,00:03:51.520,00:03:55.130
We can solve this for c.,00:03:55.130,00:03:57.820
"And we find the answer, that the
number of ways that the n",00:03:57.820,00:04:02.600
"items can be partitioned into
subsets of the given sizes is",00:04:02.600,00:04:07.090
"n factorial divided by the
product of the factorials of",00:04:07.090,00:04:11.170
the different ni's.,00:04:11.170,00:04:13.710
"This particular expression
is called the multinomial",00:04:13.710,00:04:17.399
"coefficient, and it generalizes
the binomial",00:04:17.399,00:04:20.920
coefficient.,00:04:20.920,00:04:21.970
"The binomial coefficient was
referring to the case where we",00:04:21.970,00:04:26.690
"essentially split our set into
one subset with k elements,",00:04:26.690,00:04:34.870
"and then the second subset gets
the remaining elements.",00:04:34.870,00:04:40.850
"So the special case where r is
equal to 2, and n1 is equal to",00:04:40.850,00:04:47.600
"k, n2 equals to n minus k,
this corresponds to a",00:04:47.600,00:04:51.940
"partition of a set into two
subsets, or what is the same",00:04:51.940,00:04:56.210
"just selecting the first subset
and putting everything",00:04:56.210,00:05:00.910
else in the second subset.,00:05:00.910,00:05:03.260
"And you can check that in this
particular case, the",00:05:03.260,00:05:07.490
"expression for the multinomial
coefficient agrees with the",00:05:07.490,00:05:10.480
"expression that we had derived
for the binomial coefficient.",00:05:10.480,00:05:13.500
