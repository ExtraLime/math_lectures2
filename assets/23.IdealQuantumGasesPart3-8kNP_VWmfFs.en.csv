"PROFESSOR: So we've been
developing the procedure",00:00:21.690,00:00:24.680
"to describe a quantum gas
of identical particles.",00:00:24.680,00:00:27.610
That's our non-interacting.,00:00:38.335,00:00:39.460
So what does that mean?,00:00:48.200,00:00:50.390
"Is that we are thinking
about the Hamiltonian",00:00:50.390,00:00:52.940
for a system of N particles.,00:00:52.940,00:00:55.860
"If they are not
interacting, it can",00:00:55.860,00:00:58.240
"be written as the sum
of the contributions",00:00:58.240,00:01:00.990
for the individual particles.,00:01:00.990,00:01:03.590
"And if they are
identical, it's basically",00:01:03.590,00:01:05.750
"the same particle
for each one of them.",00:01:05.750,00:01:09.360
"Same Hamiltonian for
each one of them.",00:01:09.360,00:01:13.600
OK?,00:01:13.600,00:01:14.840
How do we handle these?,00:01:14.840,00:01:17.420
"Well, if you regard this
as a quantum problem,",00:01:17.420,00:01:20.870
"for a single particle--
so for each one",00:01:20.870,00:01:23.400
"of these Hamiltonians-- we
can find the eigenstates.",00:01:23.400,00:01:28.680
"So there's a bunch of states
that say label by k because we",00:01:28.680,00:01:33.790
"are ultimately have in
mind the plane waves that",00:01:33.790,00:01:36.300
describe gas particles in a box.,00:01:36.300,00:01:41.040
"And there is corresponding
energy levels",00:01:41.040,00:01:43.540
"for the single
particles, epsilon k.",00:01:43.540,00:01:46.020
"And the single particle
spectrum can therefore",00:01:48.680,00:01:53.180
"can be described by a bunch
of energies, a lot of energy",00:01:53.180,00:01:58.230
"levels, with
different values of k",00:01:58.230,00:02:00.980
"and different allowed
discretized energies.",00:02:00.980,00:02:06.790
"Now, when we want to describe
a case of N particles",00:02:06.790,00:02:11.390
"that are
non-interacting, we said",00:02:11.390,00:02:13.930
"that we could, in
principle, pick one k here,",00:02:13.930,00:02:18.250
"one k here, one k here.",00:02:18.250,00:02:21.550
"And if we are
dealing with bosons,",00:02:21.550,00:02:23.580
"potentially more than
one at each side.",00:02:23.580,00:02:27.500
"And so the state would
then be described",00:02:27.500,00:02:31.550
"by a bunch of
occupation numbers Nk.",00:02:31.550,00:02:36.190
"And this Nk will be 0 or 1 if
you are talking about fermions,",00:02:36.190,00:02:40.890
"but any integer if you
are talking about bosons.",00:02:40.890,00:02:44.280
"So this eta being
plus or minus was",00:02:44.280,00:02:46.900
"used to distinguish
appropriate symmetrization",00:02:46.900,00:02:49.162
or anti-symmetrization.,00:02:49.162,00:02:50.120
"Now, once we have a
state such as this,",00:02:53.270,00:02:57.820
"clearly the N
particle hamintonium",00:02:57.820,00:03:02.110
"acting on a state
that is symmetrized",00:03:02.110,00:03:05.385
"with these bunch of
occupation numbers",00:03:05.385,00:03:09.180
will give us back this state.,00:03:09.180,00:03:11.900
"The energy that we
would be getting",00:03:11.900,00:03:14.830
"is summing over all
possible k values, epsilon k",00:03:14.830,00:03:19.890
"times the number of occurrance
of that in this state.",00:03:19.890,00:03:25.850
"Again, multiplying
this state back.",00:03:25.850,00:03:27.970
"Of course, we have a constraint
that the number of particles",00:03:32.750,00:03:39.400
"matches the sum of the
occupation numbers.",00:03:39.400,00:03:42.070
"So then we said,
OK, this is just",00:03:46.760,00:03:49.600
"a description of the state
that they want to describe,",00:03:49.600,00:03:54.930
"or the set of states
that represent",00:03:54.930,00:03:59.600
"this system of identical
non-interacting partners",00:03:59.600,00:04:03.950
in quantum mechanics.,00:04:03.950,00:04:05.960
"So the next stage, we want to
do some kind of first statistics",00:04:05.960,00:04:09.700
for them.,00:04:09.700,00:04:11.100
"And we had seen that
basically, in order",00:04:11.100,00:04:13.830
"to assign appropriate statistics
in case of quantum systems,",00:04:13.830,00:04:19.320
"we have to deal with
a density matrix.",00:04:19.320,00:04:22.670
"And we saw that in the
canonical representation,",00:04:22.670,00:04:26.660
"the density matrix
is complicated",00:04:26.660,00:04:29.480
"and amounts to some kind of
interaction among particles.",00:04:29.480,00:04:33.850
"Although there is no
interaction at this level,",00:04:33.850,00:04:36.930
"the symmetrization or
anti-symmetrization",00:04:36.930,00:04:40.620
"create states that are
intermixed in a manner that",00:04:40.620,00:04:43.960
"appears as if you
have an interaction.",00:04:43.960,00:04:47.080
"We found that, however,
we could get rid of that",00:04:47.080,00:04:49.850
"by going to the grand canonical
ensemble where we would trade",00:04:49.850,00:04:59.960
"in the constraint that
the number of particles",00:04:59.960,00:05:02.440
"is fixed with a
chemical potential.",00:05:02.440,00:05:04.820
"And in this ensemble, we
found that the density matrix",00:05:07.570,00:05:14.150
"is diagonal in this
representation.",00:05:14.150,00:05:17.320
"So the diagonal
elements can be thought",00:05:17.320,00:05:20.090
"of as the probability of one of
these occupation number sets.",00:05:20.090,00:05:25.620
"And so the probability of a
particular set of occupations",00:05:25.620,00:05:32.400
"in this grand
canonical prescription",00:05:32.400,00:05:35.690
"is proportional to e
to the beta-- of course",00:05:35.690,00:05:40.680
"we have mu if we are going to
this grand canonical ensemble--",00:05:40.680,00:05:46.860
"minus epsilon k,
and then we had Nk.",00:05:46.860,00:05:53.610
"So the probability that
a particular one of these",00:05:53.610,00:06:00.720
"is occupied Nk times in this
grand canonical prescription",00:06:00.720,00:06:06.360
is simply an exponential.,00:06:06.360,00:06:09.180
"And of course, the
different k levels",00:06:09.180,00:06:12.280
"are completely
independent of each other.",00:06:12.280,00:06:14.440
"So the probability factor
arises in this fashion.",00:06:14.440,00:06:17.900
"Of course, as any probability,
we have to normalize this.",00:06:17.900,00:06:22.200
Normalization is appropriate.,00:06:22.200,00:06:26.120
"We call the grand canonical
partition function",00:06:26.120,00:06:29.560
"and will be different
whether we are dealing",00:06:29.560,00:06:31.640
"with boson statistics
or fermion statistics.",00:06:31.640,00:06:34.460
"Actually, because we have
a structure such as this,",00:06:37.960,00:06:43.880
"Q is going to be the
product of the normalization",00:06:43.880,00:06:47.330
of each individual one.,00:06:47.330,00:06:50.290
"And therefore, log
of Q is going to be",00:06:50.290,00:06:55.705
"a sum of the
contributions that I",00:06:55.705,00:06:58.970
"would get for the normalization
of each individual ones.",00:06:58.970,00:07:02.960
"And of course, the log
of whatever normalization",00:07:02.960,00:07:06.150
I have for the individual one.,00:07:06.150,00:07:09.280
"If I have the case of a fermions
where Nk gets 0 or 1 as the two",00:07:09.280,00:07:16.780
"possibilities, then
the normalization",00:07:16.780,00:07:19.700
"will be simply 1 plus
this exponential.",00:07:19.700,00:07:24.510
"And I choose to write that
as z e to the minus beta",00:07:24.510,00:07:28.773
"epsilon of k where
I have introduced z",00:07:28.773,00:07:34.566
to be e to the beta mu.,00:07:34.566,00:07:36.900
"Because this combination
occurs all the time,",00:07:36.900,00:07:40.030
"I don't want to
keep repeating that.",00:07:40.030,00:07:44.270
"So this was for the
case of fermions.",00:07:44.270,00:07:47.570
"For the case of bosons where
N goes 0, 1, 2, 3, et cetera,",00:07:47.570,00:07:52.630
this is a geometric series.,00:07:52.630,00:07:55.180
"For the geometric
series, when I sum it,",00:07:55.180,00:07:59.250
I would get 1 over this factor.,00:07:59.250,00:08:01.910
"So when I take the log I
will have a minus sign here.",00:08:01.910,00:08:06.910
"And I can put the
Boson and Fermi cases",00:08:06.910,00:08:10.290
"together by simply putting
a factor of minus eta",00:08:10.290,00:08:14.290
"here so that I have the plus
for the case of fermions",00:08:14.290,00:08:18.990
"and the minus for
the case of bosons.",00:08:18.990,00:08:22.724
OK?,00:08:22.724,00:08:25.610
"So this is one thing
that we will be using.",00:08:25.610,00:08:30.000
"The other thing is that
this is the probability",00:08:30.000,00:08:33.370
"for this level having a
certain occupation number.",00:08:33.370,00:08:38.299
"In k we can always ask,
what is the average of Nk?",00:08:38.299,00:08:43.441
"And from this probability it is
easy to calculate the average.",00:08:46.390,00:08:52.290
"And the answer, again,
can be collapsed",00:08:52.290,00:08:55.100
"into one expression for the
case of bosons and fermions",00:08:55.100,00:08:59.160
"as 1 over z inverse e to the
beta epsilon of k minus eta",00:08:59.160,00:09:07.600
"encompassing both
fermions and bosons.",00:09:07.600,00:09:11.800
"So these results give some idea
both at the microscopic level--",00:09:11.800,00:09:23.760
"in terms of occupation numbers
of these different levels--",00:09:23.760,00:09:28.060
"and macroscopic level a
grand partition function",00:09:28.060,00:09:31.090
"from which we can
construct thermodynamics.",00:09:31.090,00:09:34.130
"Actually, full
probability, again,",00:09:34.130,00:09:36.030
"in this ensemble which we
can transform in principle",00:09:36.030,00:09:39.560
"and get density matrices,
et cetera, in other basis.",00:09:39.560,00:09:43.410
"But these are the
kinds of things",00:09:43.410,00:09:45.940
"that we can do for any
interacting Hamiltonian.",00:09:45.940,00:09:51.390
OK?,00:09:51.390,00:09:54.390
"Now, what I said over
here was that I'm actually",00:09:54.390,00:09:58.370
interested in the case of a gas.,00:09:58.370,00:09:59.905
"So let's again think
about the type of gas",00:10:03.240,00:10:07.670
"such as the one in this
room that we are interested.",00:10:07.670,00:10:10.660
"And again, to make a
contrast with something",00:10:10.660,00:10:14.070
"that we may want
to do later, let's",00:10:14.070,00:10:16.370
"emphasize that it is a
non-relativistic gas.",00:10:16.370,00:10:19.090
"So the Hamiltonian H is
essentially free particle",00:10:26.300,00:10:35.530
"in a box of volume
V, the thing that we",00:10:35.530,00:10:39.100
"have been using
all the time, just",00:10:39.100,00:10:41.090
"the kinetic energy of
a one particle state.",00:10:41.090,00:10:44.160
"And for that we know that
the single particle energy",00:10:44.160,00:10:48.170
"levels are characterized
by a vector k.",00:10:48.170,00:10:53.090
"As three components, in fact.",00:10:53.090,00:10:55.330
"And h bar squared
over 2mk squared.",00:10:55.330,00:10:59.600
"And we've discussed what
the discretization of k",00:10:59.600,00:11:02.590
"is appropriate to
the size of the box.",00:11:02.590,00:11:06.070
We won't go over that.,00:11:06.070,00:11:07.500
"So again, maybe it is
important to mention",00:11:10.790,00:11:13.590
"that because of the
discretizatoin of the k values,",00:11:13.590,00:11:17.630
"the spacing between
possible values of k",00:11:17.630,00:11:20.145
"are 2 pi over l
in each direction.",00:11:20.145,00:11:23.270
"And ultimately
what we want to do",00:11:23.270,00:11:25.510
"is to replace these sums over
k's in the limit of large boxes",00:11:25.510,00:11:33.280
with integrals over k.,00:11:33.280,00:11:35.620
"So these go over to an
integral over k times",00:11:35.620,00:11:41.790
"the density factor that you
get in going from the sum",00:11:41.790,00:11:45.920
"to the integral, which is 2
pi cubed times the volume.",00:11:45.920,00:11:50.490
"I will introduce one
other factor here,",00:11:55.050,00:12:01.020
"which is that when we
are talking about quantum",00:12:01.020,00:12:04.710
"particles and
bosons and fermions,",00:12:04.710,00:12:10.010
"they are typically assigned
also another state--",00:12:10.010,00:12:16.050
"another parameter-- that
characterizes their spin.",00:12:16.050,00:12:19.790
"And depending on the
possible values of spin,",00:12:19.790,00:12:23.430
"you will have g
copies of the system.",00:12:23.430,00:12:27.270
"And this g will be related
to the quantum spin--",00:12:27.270,00:12:32.680
"to the formula 2s 1-- so
that when you have fermions,",00:12:32.680,00:12:38.020
"typically s is half integer and
this will be an even number.",00:12:38.020,00:12:42.440
"Whereas for bosons it
will be an odd number.",00:12:42.440,00:12:46.730
"So that's, again,
something that we've seen.",00:12:46.730,00:12:48.720
"You just, essentially
says multiply everything",00:12:48.720,00:12:51.610
by some factor of g.,00:12:51.610,00:12:53.021
"Now if I go through
this procedure",00:12:55.970,00:12:57.720
"that I have outlined
here, I will ultimately",00:12:57.720,00:13:01.180
"get the grand partition
function of the gas-- which",00:13:01.180,00:13:05.015
"as we will see is related
to its pressure-- in terms",00:13:05.015,00:13:08.210
of the chemical potential.,00:13:08.210,00:13:10.790
"Throughout the course we've seen
that the more interesting thing",00:13:10.790,00:13:13.950
"to look at is how things depend
on density rather than chemical",00:13:13.950,00:13:18.120
potential.,00:13:18.120,00:13:19.290
"So I'd better use this result
to get what the density is.",00:13:19.290,00:13:25.180
How do I do that?,00:13:25.180,00:13:26.475
"Well, once I have determined
what the chemical potential is,",00:13:26.475,00:13:31.780
"the average number
of particles will",00:13:31.780,00:13:34.150
"be the sum over and the
average occupation numbers",00:13:34.150,00:13:38.360
"that I have in all
of these states.",00:13:38.360,00:13:40.070
"And according to the
prescription that we have over",00:13:43.520,00:13:47.630
"here, in the limit of a
large box, this sum over k",00:13:47.630,00:13:51.980
"becomes gV intergral d
cubed k 2 pi Q. Ultimately",00:13:51.980,00:13:58.820
"I will divide by
V so I will have",00:13:58.820,00:14:01.540
the formula for the density.,00:14:01.540,00:14:04.050
And what is Nk?,00:14:04.050,00:14:06.600
"Well, I have the formula for Nk.",00:14:06.600,00:14:08.300
"It is 1 over z

e to the x, if you like.",00:15:08.560,00:15:12.420

Times x to the 1/2.,00:15:32.910,00:15:38.190
OK?,00:15:38.190,00:15:40.900
"Now, I realize that h bar
is in fact h divided by 2pi.",00:15:40.900,00:15:49.590
"So the 2pi I can put
in the numerator.",00:15:49.590,00:15:52.740

actually the combination h",00:15:55.930,00:16:00.710

root of 2pi mkt,",00:16:00.710,00:16:04.540

"so that's the appropriate
thing to choose.",00:16:12.570,00:16:15.195

"I take a square
root of pi inside",00:16:17.220,00:16:19.850

"Again, for later
clarity, let's make",00:16:29.280,00:16:34.020
"sure we remember
this was our lambda.",00:16:34.020,00:16:40.650
"So this is the
variable k that I need.",00:16:40.650,00:16:45.370
"In fact, for the--
for the integration",00:16:45.370,00:16:49.660
"I have to also make
a change in dk.",00:16:49.660,00:16:53.640
"So I not that dk, if I
take a derivative here,",00:16:53.640,00:16:58.830
"I will get x-- 1/2x to the minus

x to the minus 1/2 dx.,00:17:05.030,00:17:06.740
"Actually, the factor
that I need over here",00:17:12.130,00:17:15.700
"is dk-- d cubed
k over 2pi cubed.",00:17:15.700,00:17:20.710
"Now everything only depends
on the magnitude of k.",00:17:23.520,00:17:26.359
"So I will take advantage
of spherical symmetry,",00:17:26.359,00:17:30.260
"write d cubed k as 4pi k
squared dk divided by 8pi cubed.",00:17:30.260,00:17:39.950

from k squared and dk",00:17:39.950,00:17:43.700
above in terms of this x.,00:17:43.700,00:17:47.120

"k squared is simply 4pi

"dk is root pi over lambda
x to the minus 1/2 dx.",00:18:02.870,00:18:10.860

of things cancel out",00:18:14.310,00:18:16.990

in the denominator.,00:18:41.160,00:18:43.940
OK?,00:18:43.940,00:18:46.160

"have on the right
part of the board,",00:18:50.305,00:18:52.460
what do I have for density?,00:18:52.460,00:18:54.330
The density becomes simply g.,00:18:54.330,00:18:58.470
"I have this integral
over k that I",00:18:58.470,00:19:02.500

"Let me pull out the factor of
lambda cubed on the outside.",00:19:11.930,00:19:16.950

"I will pull out to that
factor of root pi over 2",00:19:20.340,00:19:25.450

the integral from 0",00:19:27.500,00:19:29.670
to infinity dx x to the 1/2.,00:19:29.670,00:19:32.910
"Actually, let me write
it in this fashion.",00:19:32.910,00:19:36.820
dx x to the 1/2.,00:19:36.820,00:19:39.840
"And in the denominator,
what do I have?",00:19:39.840,00:19:43.500
"I have z universe
into the x minus 8.",00:19:43.500,00:19:48.390
"So we did all of these and
we ended up with an integral",00:19:52.980,00:19:59.750
that we don't recognize.,00:19:59.750,00:20:02.430
"So what we are going to do is
to pretend that we recognize it",00:20:02.430,00:20:06.600
and give it a name.,00:20:06.600,00:20:08.450
All right?,00:20:08.450,00:20:09.240
"So we define a set of functions
f sub m of variable z.",00:20:09.240,00:20:23.210
"Once I do the integration over
x, I will get a function of z.",00:20:23.210,00:20:29.320
"So that function of z
I will call fm of z.",00:20:29.320,00:20:34.120
"But clearly I have a different
fm if I have eta minus 1 or eta",00:20:34.120,00:20:39.060
plus 1 for bosons of fermions.,00:20:39.060,00:20:41.930
"So there is two
classes of things.",00:20:41.930,00:20:44.080
What's this m?,00:20:44.080,00:20:46.030
OK.,00:20:46.030,00:20:47.180
"So here I had the
integral x to the 1/2.",00:20:47.180,00:20:51.460
"It turns out that you will get
a whole bunch of these integrals",00:20:51.460,00:20:55.120
"where the [INAUDIBLE] that
is out front in the numerator",00:20:55.120,00:20:57.980
is different.,00:20:57.980,00:20:59.700
"So I will generalize this x to
the 1/2, this 1/2 to something",00:20:59.700,00:21:04.680
that I'll call it m minus 1.,00:21:04.680,00:21:07.400
"And then I have z inverse
e to the x minus eta.",00:21:07.400,00:21:13.440
"And if these normalized
so that what is in front",00:21:13.440,00:21:17.470
is 1 over m minus 1 factorial.,00:21:17.470,00:21:19.855
OK?,00:21:26.604,00:21:27.600
"So these are very
important functions.",00:21:27.600,00:21:30.350
"Everything we will
do later on we",00:21:30.350,00:21:32.250
"will be expressing in
terms of these functions.",00:21:32.250,00:21:34.390
"Now, clearly what is happening
here corresponds to m minus 1",00:21:37.300,00:21:42.060
"being equal to 1/2
or m being 3/2.",00:21:42.060,00:21:48.580
What is this normalization?,00:21:48.580,00:21:51.426
"Well, for the normalization,
if this is 1/2",00:21:51.426,00:21:56.230
I would need 1/2 factorial.,00:21:56.230,00:21:59.450
"And if you go and look at
the various definitions",00:21:59.450,00:22:03.070
"that we have for the gamma
function or the factorial,",00:22:03.070,00:22:07.430
"you can check that 1/2
factorial is root pi over 2.",00:22:07.430,00:22:11.580
"And, indeed, we saw
this already when",00:22:11.580,00:22:14.560
"we wrote the expression
for the surface area",00:22:14.560,00:22:17.910
"in general dimensions
that involved",00:22:17.910,00:22:21.246
"factorial function
appearing as fractions.",00:22:21.246,00:22:24.470
"And in order to get the
right result in two or three",00:22:24.470,00:22:27.000
"dimensions, you can
check that this root",00:22:27.000,00:22:30.330
"pi over 2 for 1/2
factorial is correct.",00:22:30.330,00:22:33.830
"So, indeed, I already have
this root pi over 2 over here.",00:22:33.830,00:22:38.670
It was properly normalized.,00:22:38.670,00:22:40.840
"So the whole thing
here can be written",00:22:40.840,00:22:43.490
"as n is g over lambda
cubed f 3/2 eta of z.",00:22:43.490,00:22:51.270
"That is the expression
that relates",00:22:51.270,00:22:53.560
"the density to the chemical
potential or this communication",00:22:53.560,00:22:58.720
"e to the beta mu, which
is z or the fugacity",00:22:58.720,00:23:03.350
is simply this nice formula.,00:23:03.350,00:23:05.930
OK?,00:23:10.240,00:23:10.740
"But what we want is
to calculate something",00:23:19.750,00:23:22.540
like the pressure for the gas.,00:23:22.540,00:23:25.020
"Well, let me remind you that
log Q, essentially, quite",00:23:25.020,00:23:29.880
"generally, log Q comes
from normalizing something",00:23:29.880,00:23:35.430
"that is like mu times the
total number of particles",00:23:35.430,00:23:41.580
"minus the energy-- you can
kind of read that from here--",00:23:41.580,00:23:45.100
"and then there would be TS
from the number of states.",00:23:45.100,00:23:50.820
"This was the general
formula that we had.",00:23:50.820,00:23:53.810
"And when we substitute for
a system that is extensive,",00:23:53.810,00:23:59.660
"where E for a gas is
mu n plus TS minus PV,",00:23:59.660,00:24:08.410
"we see that the log of
the partition function",00:24:08.410,00:24:11.980
"is simply the
combination beta PV.",00:24:11.980,00:24:14.250
"Of course, again, this
pressure as a function",00:24:18.350,00:24:20.785
"of density or chemical
potential would be different",00:24:20.785,00:24:23.860
"whether we are thinking
about bosons of fermions.",00:24:23.860,00:24:26.070
"But it can be calculated
from the kind of sum",00:24:28.760,00:24:32.440
that we have over here.,00:24:32.440,00:24:34.920
So let's do that.,00:24:34.920,00:24:37.060
"So I have beta P
which is something",00:24:37.060,00:24:42.150
"like log Q divided
by V. Is obtained",00:24:42.150,00:24:47.290
"by doing this sum over k
over V. And so what do I get?",00:24:47.290,00:24:52.620
"I will get-- first of all,
I have the minus eta sum",00:24:52.620,00:24:56.780
"over k [INAUDIBLE]

"The volume factor cancels
because I divided by volume.",00:25:06.900,00:25:11.310
"I have log of 1 minus eta z
e to the minus beta-- again,",00:25:11.310,00:25:20.020
"h bar squared k
squared over 2m--",00:25:20.020,00:25:23.820
"are the energy that
I'm dealing with.",00:25:23.820,00:25:27.950
OK?,00:25:27.950,00:25:28.621
Fine.,00:25:28.621,00:25:29.120
What do we do with this?,00:25:29.120,00:25:32.276
"We make the same
change of variables",00:25:32.276,00:25:35.310
"that we have over
here from k to x.",00:25:35.310,00:25:39.450
"So then I would have minus
eta d cubed k over 2pi cubed",00:25:39.450,00:25:47.040
"gets replaced with this 2
over root pi lambda cubed.",00:25:47.040,00:25:53.590

integral 0 to infinity dx",00:25:56.750,00:26:02.272
"x to the 1/2 log of 1 minus
eta z e to the minus x.",00:26:02.272,00:26:11.827
Huh.,00:26:16.210,00:26:18.160
It seems like-- yes?,00:26:18.160,00:26:20.314
"AUDIENCE: What happened
to your factor g?",00:26:20.314,00:26:22.409
PROFESSOR: G?,00:26:22.409,00:26:22.950
Good question.,00:26:22.950,00:26:23.810
Anything else?,00:26:26.570,00:26:27.590
"So I was hoping
to have integrals",00:26:32.520,00:26:35.590
"that are all expressible in
terms of this-- these set",00:26:35.590,00:26:39.270
of functions that I defined.,00:26:39.270,00:26:42.620
"This log does not fall
into this category.",00:26:42.620,00:26:45.530
Should I define something else?,00:26:45.530,00:26:48.050
"Well, the answer
is no because I can",00:26:48.050,00:26:50.010
"make that integral
look like this",00:26:50.010,00:26:53.300
"by simbly doing an
integration by parts.",00:26:53.300,00:26:57.590
"So we do integrate by parts
in which case what I do",00:26:57.590,00:27:09.810
"is I take a derivative
of this and I",00:27:09.810,00:27:14.890
"take an integral
of x to the 1/2.",00:27:14.890,00:27:18.350
"Integral of x to the 1/2

"There is, of course,
a minus sign involved.",00:27:23.910,00:27:27.351
So this minus becomes plus eta.,00:27:27.351,00:27:32.132
"Make sure I have
the g this time.",00:27:32.132,00:27:35.210

from 0 to infinity dx.",00:27:41.010,00:27:46.810
"x to the 1/2 became
x to the 3/2.",00:27:46.810,00:27:50.540
The 3/2 I will bring out front.,00:27:50.540,00:27:52.990
So I have 1 over 3/2 here.,00:27:52.990,00:27:55.300
"And then I have to take the
derivative of this function.",00:27:58.030,00:28:01.480

of the log?",00:28:01.480,00:28:04.180

"of the argument of
the log which is minus",00:28:10.810,00:28:14.820
"eta z, the derivative
of e to the minus x,",00:28:14.820,00:28:17.770

And this minus becomes plus.,00:28:19.320,00:28:21.720
OK?,00:28:25.310,00:28:26.670
"So let's arrange
things a little bit.",00:28:26.670,00:28:30.540
"I can get rid of these etas

"What is the answer, therefore?",00:28:37.350,00:28:38.850
It is g over lambda cubed.,00:28:38.850,00:28:44.900
That's fine.,00:28:44.900,00:28:47.420
"If root pi over 2

"And lo and behold, we have
a function of the variety",00:29:28.060,00:29:32.670

board corresponding to n minus 1",00:29:32.670,00:29:37.310

"So what we have here is
that beta P, depending",00:29:41.180,00:29:46.790
"on whatever statistics
we are dealing with,",00:29:46.790,00:29:49.500
"is g over lambda
cubed f 5/2 eta of z.",00:29:49.500,00:29:57.432
Yes?,00:30:04.390,00:30:05.258
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:30:05.258,00:30:08.130
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:30:08.130,00:30:09.090
"So what you have to
do is always ensure",00:30:09.090,00:30:11.510
"what is happening to
the boundary terms.",00:30:11.510,00:30:14.080
"Boundary terms will
be a product of x",00:30:14.080,00:30:16.630
to the 3/2 and this factor.,00:30:16.630,00:30:21.290
"At x equals to 0, x to the 3/s
will ensure that you are 0.",00:30:21.290,00:30:27.270
"At x goes to infinity,
the exponential",00:30:27.270,00:30:29.960
will ensure that you're to 0.,00:30:29.960,00:30:32.640
"So the boundary
terms are important",00:30:32.640,00:30:34.830
"and indeed you
have to check them.",00:30:34.830,00:30:36.880
"And you can check
that they are 0.",00:30:36.880,00:30:39.440
OK?,00:30:43.390,00:30:44.616
"AUDIENCE: I think the factor
that multiples x to the 3/2",00:30:44.616,00:30:48.350
is [INAUDIBLE].,00:30:48.350,00:30:50.590
"But it's-- the
argument still holds.",00:30:50.590,00:30:52.222
"PROFESSOR: The
argument still holds",00:30:52.222,00:30:53.680
"because as x goes to infinity,
e to the minus x goes to 0.",00:30:53.680,00:30:58.370

"In fact, you can ask,
how does it go to 0?",00:31:00.320,00:31:02.600
It goes to 0 exponentially.,00:31:02.600,00:31:04.690
"Exponentially it
will [INAUDIBLE].",00:31:04.690,00:31:08.300
Yes.,00:31:08.300,00:31:08.800
Thank you for the correction.,00:31:08.800,00:31:10.008
OK?,00:31:18.330,00:31:18.830
All right.,00:31:21.620,00:31:22.130
"There's one other thing
that we can take a look at.",00:31:22.130,00:31:26.720
The total energy.,00:31:26.720,00:31:28.770
OK.,00:31:28.770,00:31:29.830
"So the energy in each
one of these states",00:31:29.830,00:31:33.240
is given by that formula.,00:31:33.240,00:31:35.680
"So if I ask, what is the total
expectation value of energy?",00:31:35.680,00:31:39.640
"And again, in
thermodynamics we expect",00:31:39.640,00:31:43.980
"the extensive quantities such
as the energy should have,",00:31:43.980,00:31:48.040
"in an aerodynamic sense,
well defined values",00:31:48.040,00:31:50.650
"so I won't write the
expectation value.",00:31:50.650,00:31:53.440
"Is going to be a sum
over k Nk epsilon k.",00:31:53.440,00:32:03.020
"And this will depend on the
statistics that I'm looking at.",00:32:03.020,00:32:07.320
"And what I will have is
that this will go over",00:32:07.320,00:32:11.670
"to an integral over k divided
by 2pi cubed multiplied g",00:32:11.670,00:32:21.220
"and multiplied by
V. I have epsilon",00:32:21.220,00:32:28.160
"of k which is h bar
squared k squared over 2m.",00:32:28.160,00:32:33.730
"The expectation
value of N, which",00:32:33.730,00:32:36.840
"is z inverse e to the minus
beta-- sorry-- z inverse",00:32:36.840,00:32:43.900
"e to the plus beta h bar squared
k squared over 2m minus 8.",00:32:43.900,00:32:49.556
OK?,00:32:56.230,00:32:56.730
"So the simplest way to do this
is to first of all divide by V.",00:32:59.550,00:33:08.090
"So I can define
an energy density.",00:33:08.090,00:33:11.960
"Actually, since I'm
going to change variables",00:33:15.770,00:33:20.030
"to this combination
that is x, I notice",00:33:20.030,00:33:23.740
"that up to a factor of
betas the numerator is x.",00:33:23.740,00:33:27.690
"So let me actually calculate
the combination beta e over V.",00:33:27.690,00:33:33.070
"That only depends on
this combination x.",00:33:33.070,00:33:37.080
So what is it?,00:33:37.080,00:33:38.200
"It is g-- the integral
over k, I know",00:33:38.200,00:33:43.360
"how to replace it
with something that",00:33:43.360,00:33:46.090
"involves x-- is going to give
me 2 over root pi lambda cubed.",00:33:46.090,00:33:54.295
Integral 0 to infinity dx.,00:33:54.295,00:33:59.970
"From the change of variables,
I have x to the 1/2.",00:33:59.970,00:34:04.440
"But I introduced
one factor of x here",00:34:04.440,00:34:07.300
"because I have this energy
factor in the numerator.",00:34:07.300,00:34:12.590
"So that changes this
to x to the 3/2.",00:34:12.590,00:34:16.010
"And then again, I have z
inverse e to the x minus 8.",00:34:16.010,00:34:19.214
OK?,00:34:22.179,00:34:22.679
"So if is one of the integrals
that we have defined.",00:34:25.659,00:34:29.230
"In fact, it is exactly what I
have above for the pressure,",00:34:29.230,00:34:34.989
"except that I don't have the
factor of 3/2 that appeared",00:34:34.989,00:34:39.630
"nicely to give the
right normalization.",00:34:39.630,00:34:44.850
"So what I conclude is
that this quantity is",00:34:44.850,00:34:51.920
"in fact g over lambda cubed
times 3/2 of f 5/2 eta of z.",00:34:51.920,00:35:09.199
OK?,00:35:12.691,00:35:13.191
"But they are exactly
the same functions",00:35:18.190,00:35:21.060
for energy and pressure.,00:35:21.060,00:35:22.595
"So you can see
that, irrespective",00:35:25.560,00:35:30.480
"of what the chemical
potential is doing,",00:35:30.480,00:35:33.740
"I can state that for the quantum
system e is always 3/2 PV.",00:35:33.740,00:35:40.110
"Of course, we have seen
this expression classically.",00:35:42.970,00:35:49.110
"Now what happens
quantum mechanically",00:35:49.110,00:35:50.950
"is that the pressure
starts to vary",00:35:50.950,00:35:52.930
"in some complicated
way with density.",00:35:52.930,00:35:55.440
"But what we learn is
that energy will also",00:35:55.440,00:35:58.720
"vary in the same complicated
way with density,",00:35:58.720,00:36:02.810
"such that always this
formula EV 3/2 PV is valid.",00:36:02.810,00:36:10.310
"There is some nice
symmetry reason",00:36:10.310,00:36:12.900
"for why that is the
case that you explore",00:36:12.900,00:36:16.025
"in one of the problems
that you will see.",00:36:16.025,00:36:17.930
OK?,00:36:22.311,00:36:22.810
"So these are the
characteristics.",00:36:25.830,00:36:31.850
"In some sense we have
solved the problem",00:36:31.850,00:36:34.790
"because we know both density
and pressure in terms",00:36:34.790,00:36:39.670
of chemical potential.,00:36:39.670,00:36:41.840
"So all we need to do
is to invert this, get",00:36:41.840,00:36:44.770
"the chemical potential
as a function of density,",00:36:44.770,00:36:47.750
"insert it in the
formula for pressure",00:36:47.750,00:36:49.780
"and we have pressure as
a function of density.",00:36:49.780,00:36:52.420
"But since these are
kind of implicit",00:36:52.420,00:36:55.610
"through these f
functions, we don't quite",00:36:55.610,00:37:00.190
know what that means.,00:37:00.190,00:37:02.480
"So the next stage
is to really study",00:37:02.480,00:37:05.900
"how these f functions
behave and how",00:37:05.900,00:37:10.270
"we can relate their behaviors
to dependence on density.",00:37:10.270,00:37:15.920
"And we will see that we have to
distinguish between low density",00:37:15.920,00:37:20.110
and high density regimes.,00:37:20.110,00:37:23.090
What does it mean?,00:37:23.090,00:37:25.230
"Well, you can see that both
have players on the right hand",00:37:25.230,00:37:27.780
side is dimensionless.,00:37:27.780,00:37:30.650
"The only dimension
full combination",00:37:30.650,00:37:33.390
"that we have here is
N-- well, we can make it",00:37:33.390,00:37:36.970
"dimensionless by multiplying
by lambda cubed over g.",00:37:36.970,00:37:41.850
"So it turns out
that whether or not",00:37:41.850,00:37:46.180
"you see things that are
classical or things that",00:37:46.180,00:37:48.930
"are very quantum
mechanical depend",00:37:48.930,00:37:51.510
on this degeneracy factor.,00:37:51.510,00:37:53.270
"Which, within our context of
statistical physics of gases,",00:37:56.070,00:38:00.780
"we define to be
the communication N",00:38:00.780,00:38:03.400
lambda cubed over g.,00:38:03.400,00:38:04.810
"And we will regain
classical behaviors",00:38:07.480,00:38:11.890
"when degeneracy
is small, density",00:38:11.890,00:38:15.040
"is small enough such that
d is much less than 1.",00:38:15.040,00:38:18.680
"We will see totally
new behavior that",00:38:18.680,00:38:21.320
"is appropriate to quantum
mechanics in other limit",00:38:21.320,00:38:24.990
where [? d ?] becomes large.,00:38:24.990,00:38:27.852
OK?,00:38:27.852,00:38:29.710
"So this distinguishes classical
versus quantum behavior.",00:38:29.710,00:38:42.770
"Now, we expect to regain
classical behavior",00:38:48.540,00:38:53.700
"in the limit of
very low densities.",00:38:53.700,00:38:56.360
"That's what we've
been kind of saying",00:38:56.360,00:38:58.460
"from the very first lecture
that low density gas has",00:38:58.460,00:39:02.050
"this ideal behavior
where PV is Nkt.",00:39:02.050,00:39:06.440
"And, therefore, let's
focus on the limit",00:39:06.440,00:39:09.980
"where V is much less than
1, which is classical.",00:39:09.980,00:39:14.950
"And since d is f
3/2 eta of z, we",00:39:18.290,00:39:31.530
"need the behavior of the
function when it is small--",00:39:31.530,00:39:37.420
"and I'll show you
[INAUDIBLE] consistently",00:39:37.420,00:39:39.830
"that the function is small
when it's argument is small.",00:39:39.830,00:39:45.030
"So we'll see that d
less than 1 implies",00:39:45.030,00:39:49.420
"or is implied by z
being less than 1.",00:39:49.420,00:39:53.035
OK?,00:39:55.770,00:39:57.400
"So let's take a look at
one of these functions,",00:39:57.400,00:40:00.275
"fm eta z, 1 over m
minus 1 factorial, 0",00:40:00.275,00:40:07.400
"to infinity dx, x
to the m minus 1,",00:40:07.400,00:40:11.980
z universe e to the x minus 1.,00:40:11.980,00:40:15.110
"And I'd like to explore the
limit of this when z is small.",00:40:17.940,00:40:24.730
"So that's currently not very
good because I have z inverse.",00:40:24.730,00:40:28.140
"So what I will do is I will
multiply by z e to the minus",00:40:28.140,00:40:32.300
"x both numerator
and denominator.",00:40:32.300,00:40:35.790
"So I will have m minus
1 factorial integral 0",00:40:35.790,00:40:41.480
"to infinity dx x
to the n minus 1.",00:40:41.480,00:40:46.550
I have z e to the minus x.,00:40:46.550,00:40:50.300
"I have-- oops, there
was an eta here.",00:40:50.300,00:40:54.560
1 minus eta z e to the minus x.,00:40:54.560,00:40:59.981
OK?,00:40:59.981,00:41:00.480
"Then I say, well, the
thing that is appearing",00:41:02.990,00:41:05.850
"in the denominator,
I can write as a sum",00:41:05.850,00:41:10.350
"of a geometric series
in powers of z.",00:41:10.350,00:41:12.990
"And that's, after all,
what I'm attempting to do,",00:41:12.990,00:41:15.750
"make an expansion
in powers of z.",00:41:15.750,00:41:18.390
It starts with z to the minus x.,00:41:23.000,00:41:26.620
"And 1 over 1 minus
eta z to the minus",00:41:26.620,00:41:31.180
"x I can write as the sum alpha
going from 0 to infinity of eta",00:41:31.180,00:41:38.300
"z e to the minus x raised
to the power of [INAUDIBLE].",00:41:38.300,00:41:41.980
"This geometric series sums
to what I have over there.",00:41:41.980,00:41:46.390
OK?,00:41:46.390,00:41:48.510
"Let's rearrange
this a little bit.",00:41:48.510,00:41:51.830
"I will take the sum
over alpha outside.",00:41:51.830,00:41:57.090
"Well, I notice that actually
I have here, this first term,",00:41:57.090,00:42:02.320
"which is different from
this by a factor of eta.",00:42:02.320,00:42:04.810
"So let me multiply by an
eta and get another eta.",00:42:04.810,00:42:10.280
"And then I have a sum
that starts from 1",00:42:10.280,00:42:13.600
"to infinity of eta z e to the
minus x to the power of alpha.",00:42:13.600,00:42:23.280
"So I have eta z to
the power of alpha.",00:42:23.280,00:42:27.400
I have one other eta here.,00:42:27.400,00:42:29.410
"And then I have the integration
over x, x to the m minus 1.",00:42:32.620,00:42:42.080
"I didn't write e to the
minus x to the alpha",00:42:46.140,00:42:48.690

out the integration.",00:42:48.690,00:42:51.480
"I will write it now. e
to the minus alpha x.",00:42:51.480,00:42:54.514

over n minus 1 factor.",00:42:57.720,00:43:01.438

integration that you have seen.",00:43:09.260,00:43:14.080
"The result of doing
integral dx x to the m",00:43:14.080,00:43:17.240

simply m minus 1 factorial.",00:43:17.240,00:43:21.440
"Except that it is
not e to the minus",00:43:26.010,00:43:28.270
"x but it's e to
the minus alpha x.",00:43:28.270,00:43:31.160
"I can rescale
everything by alpha",00:43:31.160,00:43:34.280

factor of alpha to there.",00:43:34.280,00:43:38.078
OK?,00:43:38.078,00:43:39.560
So what do we have?,00:43:39.560,00:43:41.700
"We have that fm eta of z
as a [? power series ?]",00:43:41.700,00:43:48.100

minus, et cetera.",00:44:04.690,00:44:07.760
"So if I were to
explicitly write this,",00:44:07.760,00:44:10.440
you will see how nice it is.,00:44:10.440,00:44:12.350

note the following.",00:44:41.930,00:44:46.250
"If I take a derivative of
this function with respect",00:44:46.250,00:44:51.340
"to z-- its argument-- then
in this power series, say,",00:44:51.340,00:44:56.290
z to the 4 becomes 4z cubed.,00:44:56.290,00:45:00.020
"4 will cancel one of
the 4's that I have here",00:45:00.020,00:45:02.880
"and it becomes 4
to the m minus 1.",00:45:02.880,00:45:05.290
This becomes 3 to the m minus 1.,00:45:05.290,00:45:07.840
"So you can see that
the coefficients that",00:45:07.840,00:45:10.070
"were powers of m become
powers of m minus 1.",00:45:10.070,00:45:15.230
"Numerator has gone
down by one factor.",00:45:15.230,00:45:18.290
So let's multiply by z.,00:45:18.290,00:45:21.160
"So the numerator is
now what it was before.",00:45:21.160,00:45:23.880
"The denominators, rather than
being raised to the power of m,",00:45:23.880,00:45:27.020
"are raised to the
power of m minus 1.",00:45:27.020,00:45:29.520
"So clearly, this is the
same thing as fm minus 1.",00:45:29.520,00:45:36.030
"So basically these functions
have this nice character",00:45:36.030,00:45:41.110
that they are like a ladder.,00:45:41.110,00:45:42.400
"You take a derivative
of one and you",00:45:42.400,00:45:44.860
"get the one that is
indexed by one less.",00:45:44.860,00:45:48.623
OK?,00:45:53.053,00:45:53.553
"AUDIENCE: Is there a factor
of eta that comes out to be",00:46:03.413,00:46:06.371
[INAUDIBLE].,00:46:06.371,00:46:09.225
PROFESSOR: In the derivatives?,00:46:09.225,00:46:10.475
"AUDIENCE: I mean, it seems to
me that there's an eta-- like,",00:46:10.475,00:46:15.692
in that relation that--,00:46:15.692,00:46:16.650
PROFESSOR: In this relation?,00:46:16.650,00:46:17.816
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:46:17.816,00:46:18.560
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:46:18.560,00:46:19.143
So let's do it by step.,00:46:19.143,00:46:21.620
"If I take a
derivative, divide dz,",00:46:21.620,00:46:28.420
"I get 1 plus eta z squared
z 2 to the m minus 1 plus",00:46:28.420,00:46:35.700
z squared' 3 to the m minus 1.,00:46:35.700,00:46:40.460
"Then I multiply by
z, this becomes z,",00:46:40.460,00:46:44.845
"this becomes z squared,
this becomes z cubed.",00:46:44.845,00:46:47.500
"And you can see
that the etas are",00:46:47.500,00:46:49.210
exactly where they should be.,00:46:49.210,00:46:52.969
"AUDIENCE: Would you explain
why the index of summation",00:46:52.969,00:47:03.749
starts from--,00:47:03.749,00:47:04.868
PROFESSOR: One?,00:47:04.868,00:47:05.493
AUDIENCE: --one.,00:47:05.493,00:47:06.200
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:47:06.200,00:47:06.930
"So let's take a look
at this function.",00:47:06.930,00:47:11.220
"You can see there is a z
inverse in the denominator.",00:47:11.220,00:47:15.060
So I made it into a z here.,00:47:15.060,00:47:19.290
"So you can see that if z is very
small, if will start with z.",00:47:19.290,00:47:26.640
All right?,00:47:26.640,00:47:27.140
Now what happened here?,00:47:27.140,00:47:28.740
"I wrote this as a sum
of geometric series.",00:47:28.740,00:47:32.090
"I pulled out this factor of
z that was in the numerator,",00:47:32.090,00:47:37.050
"and the denominator I wrote as
a series that starts with 0.",00:47:37.050,00:47:42.480
"But then there is
this z out front.",00:47:42.480,00:47:45.190
"I pulled this z e to the
minus x in front here",00:47:45.190,00:47:49.790
and then it starts with 1.,00:47:49.790,00:47:52.600
"I could have written it--
I can put this in here",00:47:52.600,00:47:55.030
"and write it as alpha
plus 1 with alpha",00:47:55.030,00:47:57.740
"starting from 0, et cetera.",00:47:57.740,00:47:59.235
Or I can write it [INAUDIBLE].,00:47:59.235,00:48:00.640
"Or, alternatively, you can
say, let's put the eta here",00:48:00.640,00:48:04.360
and eta here.,00:48:04.360,00:48:05.770
"And then I see that this is
the geometric series where",00:48:05.770,00:48:08.540
"the first term is this z
to the minus x [INAUDIBLE].",00:48:08.540,00:48:12.309
OK?,00:48:19.294,00:48:19.794
"So I want to erase this
board but keep this formula.",00:48:25.300,00:48:31.230
"So let me erase it
and then rewrite it.",00:48:31.230,00:48:33.826
"So this I will rewrite as
N lambda q over g, which",00:48:46.410,00:48:52.991
"is my degeneracy factor,
is f 3/2 eta of z.",00:48:52.991,00:48:59.170
"And in the limit
where z goes to small,",00:49:02.800,00:49:09.260
"I can use the expansion
that I just derived,",00:49:09.260,00:49:13.950
"which is z plus eta z squared
2 to the-- what is it--",00:49:13.950,00:49:20.840
3/2 plus z cubed.,00:49:20.840,00:49:25.620
3 to the 3/2 and so forth.,00:49:25.620,00:49:30.870
"You can see that precisely
because as z goes to 0,",00:49:30.870,00:49:35.130
"this series goes to
0, that smallness of z",00:49:35.130,00:49:38.860
"is the same thing or implied
by the smallness of z.",00:49:38.860,00:49:41.994
"But that z is equal to d
only at the lowest order.",00:49:44.720,00:49:50.140
"So what happens
at higher orders,",00:49:50.140,00:49:52.010
"z-- inverting this-- is d minus
eta z squared 2 to the 3/2 plus",00:49:52.010,00:49:58.990
"z cubed 3 to the
3/2, and so forth.",00:49:58.990,00:50:05.390
"And we saw this when I
was doing the calculation",00:50:05.390,00:50:10.370
"for the interacting gas, that
clearly to lowest order z",00:50:10.370,00:50:14.660
"equals to d, if I want
to get the next order,",00:50:14.660,00:50:19.200
"I substitute the result
of the previous order",00:50:19.200,00:50:22.150
into this expression.,00:50:22.150,00:50:23.770
"So z I substitute
for d, I will d",00:50:23.770,00:50:27.680
"minus eta d squared 2 to the
3/2 as the first contribution.",00:50:27.680,00:50:35.150
"And then something that
is order of d cubed.",00:50:35.150,00:50:37.470
"And if I want the answer
to the d cubed order,",00:50:40.340,00:50:44.120
"I take this whole thing that
is that order of d squared",00:50:44.120,00:50:47.310
and substitute in this series.,00:50:47.310,00:50:49.830
And so what do I get?,00:50:49.830,00:50:51.310
"I will get d minus
eta 2 to the 3/2,",00:50:51.310,00:50:59.620
"square of z-- which is the
square of this quantity--",00:50:59.620,00:51:03.560
"square of this quantity
is d squared minus twice",00:51:03.560,00:51:08.690
the product of these two terms.,00:51:08.690,00:51:10.960
"So I have twice eta
d cubed 2 to the 3/2.",00:51:10.960,00:51:17.030
"And then square of this term,
but that's order of e to the 4.",00:51:17.030,00:51:21.310
I don't care for that.,00:51:21.310,00:51:23.180
"And then I have, from here,
plus d cubed 3 to the 3/2",00:51:23.180,00:51:32.410
"ignoring terms of the
order of d to the 4th.",00:51:32.410,00:51:34.880
OK?,00:51:37.700,00:51:39.590
So z is--,00:51:39.590,00:51:43.320
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] z equals
d minus and the d [INAUDIBLE].",00:51:43.320,00:51:48.677

OK.,00:52:04.195,00:52:04.695
Fine.,00:52:07.520,00:52:09.076
Now let's organize terms.,00:52:09.076,00:52:11.720
The lowest order I have d.,00:52:11.720,00:52:14.050
"At order of d
squared I have still",00:52:14.050,00:52:17.280
"just this one term, minus eta
d squared over 2 to the 3/2.",00:52:17.280,00:52:25.470
"We knew that was the correct
result at order of d squared.",00:52:25.470,00:52:29.050
"At order of d cubed
I have two terms.",00:52:29.050,00:52:32.330
"One is the product
of these two terms.",00:52:32.330,00:52:35.240
"The etas disappear,
minus 2, and this",00:52:35.240,00:52:39.500
"will give me 2 over
9 which is 1/4.",00:52:39.500,00:52:42.870
"And from other part, I have
1 over 3 to the 3/1 d cubed.",00:52:47.000,00:52:53.180
"And I haven't calculate things
at order of d to the 4th.",00:52:53.180,00:52:57.210
OK?,00:53:01.410,00:53:03.370
Fine.,00:53:03.370,00:53:04.600
"So we have calculated
in a power series",00:53:04.600,00:53:08.120
"that we can go to
whatever order you like.",00:53:08.120,00:53:11.990
"This is z which is related
to chemical potential",00:53:11.990,00:53:14.790
"as a function of
this degeneracy that",00:53:14.790,00:53:16.990
is simply related to density.,00:53:16.990,00:53:19.810
"Now, the formula for the
pressure is up there.",00:53:19.810,00:53:23.760
"It is that eta P is g over
lambda cubed f 5/2 eta of z.",00:53:23.760,00:53:36.150
Right?,00:53:39.130,00:53:40.310
"So reorganizing
this a little bit,",00:53:40.310,00:53:43.940
"the dimensionless
form is beta P lambda",00:53:43.940,00:53:47.470
cubed over g f 5/2 eta of z.,00:53:47.470,00:53:52.812
f 5/2 we can make an expansion.,00:53:52.812,00:53:56.440
"It is z plus eta z squared
2 to the 5/2 plus z cubed 3",00:53:56.440,00:54:04.610
to the 5/2 and so forth.,00:54:04.610,00:54:09.130
"For z I substitute
from the line above.",00:54:09.130,00:54:13.500
"So I have d minus eta d squared
2 to the 3/2 plus 1/4 minus 1",00:54:13.500,00:54:25.710
over 3 to the 3/2 d cubed.,00:54:25.710,00:54:30.500
So that's the first term.,00:54:30.500,00:54:32.630
"The next term is eta 2
to the 5/2 z squared.",00:54:32.630,00:54:40.250
"So I have to square what is
up here and here keeping terms",00:54:40.250,00:54:44.610
to order of d cubed.,00:54:44.610,00:54:47.450
So what do I have?,00:54:47.450,00:54:48.460
"I have d squared from
squaring this term.",00:54:48.460,00:54:56.630
"And a term that is twice the
product of these two terms.",00:54:56.630,00:54:59.590
"That's the only term
that is order of d cubed.",00:54:59.590,00:55:02.420
"So I have minus 2 eta
2 to the 3/2 d cubed.",00:55:02.420,00:55:09.650
"And finally, z cubed
over 3 to the 5/2",00:55:13.220,00:55:16.120
"would be d cubed
over 3 to the 5/2.",00:55:16.120,00:55:21.590
"And I haven't
calculated anything",00:55:21.590,00:55:23.020
at all of d to the 4th.,00:55:23.020,00:55:24.940
OK?,00:55:28.300,00:55:29.910
So what do I have?,00:55:29.910,00:55:30.715
"I have that beta P
lambda cubed over g.",00:55:30.715,00:55:34.675
"Well, you can see
that everything",00:55:37.240,00:55:40.360
"is going to be proportional
to d d squared d cubed.",00:55:40.360,00:55:44.590
"So let's put out the factor of d
which is m lambda cubed over g.",00:55:44.590,00:55:49.280
"So this is just one factor
of d that I have pulled out.",00:55:49.280,00:55:55.510
"So that then I start with 1,
and then the next correction",00:55:55.510,00:56:03.780
"I have an eta d squared
2 to the 3/2 here,",00:56:03.780,00:56:09.730
"eta d squared 2 to the 5/2
here with opposite sign.",00:56:09.730,00:56:15.770
"So this is twice
bigger than that.",00:56:15.770,00:56:19.080
"So the sum total of them would
be minus eta divided by 2",00:56:19.080,00:56:24.350
"to the 5/2 times d
squared-- one factor",00:56:24.350,00:56:29.090
"of d I have out front-- the
other factor I will write here",00:56:29.090,00:56:33.820
and lambda cubed over g.,00:56:33.820,00:56:35.158
"And then at order of d cubed,
I have a bunch of terms.",00:56:38.370,00:56:44.820
"I have a 1/4 here, and from
the product of these terms,",00:56:44.820,00:56:53.360
"I will have etas disappear,
I have 2 divided by 2",00:56:53.360,00:56:59.740
"to the 8/2 which is 2
to the 4th which is 16.",00:56:59.740,00:57:03.900
"So the product of these things
will give me a minus 1/8.",00:57:03.900,00:57:08.830
"I have 1/4 minus
1/8 I will get 1/8.",00:57:08.830,00:57:13.130

PROFESSOR: OK.,00:57:18.605,00:57:19.530
"And then we have minus
3-- 1 over 3 to the 1/2",00:57:19.530,00:57:26.150
and this 3 to the 5/2.,00:57:26.150,00:57:29.050
"This is three times
larger than this.",00:57:29.050,00:57:31.200
This is 3 over 3 to the 5/2.,00:57:31.200,00:57:34.050
"Subtract one of
them, I will be left",00:57:34.050,00:57:36.350

And so forth.,00:57:45.440,00:57:46.210
"So you can see that the
form that we have is beta",00:57:49.010,00:57:54.310
"P-- the pressure--
starts with density.",00:57:54.310,00:57:58.540

through by lambda q over g.",00:57:58.540,00:58:02.440
"I start with the
ideal gas result, n,",00:58:02.440,00:58:07.640
"and then I have a correction
that is order of n squared.",00:58:07.640,00:58:11.960
I can write it as B2 n squared.,00:58:11.960,00:58:17.200
"In view up our
[INAUDIBLE] co-efficients.",00:58:17.200,00:58:20.020

"Remember that B2s, et cetera,
had dimensions of volume.",00:58:41.360,00:58:47.190
"So if the volume is
provided by lambda cubed,",00:58:47.190,00:58:51.190
it is an additional factor.,00:58:51.190,00:58:55.490
"For fermions it's a
positive pressure.",00:58:55.490,00:58:59.060
"So the pressure goes up because
fermions repel each other.",00:58:59.060,00:59:02.340
For bosons it is negative.,00:59:02.340,00:59:04.440

"But then I said that
if I went and tried",00:59:22.500,00:59:25.380
"to calculate the
next correction using",00:59:25.380,00:59:28.370
"the canonical
formulation, I would",00:59:28.370,00:59:30.570
"have to keep track
of diagrams that",00:59:30.570,00:59:32.900
"involve three exchanges
and all kinds of things",00:59:32.900,00:59:36.450
and it was complicated.,00:59:36.450,00:59:38.080
"But in this way of
looking at things,",00:59:38.080,00:59:40.030
"you can see that we can very
easily compute the [INAUDIBLE]",00:59:40.030,00:59:45.520
co-efficients and higher orders.,00:59:45.520,00:59:47.880
"In particular, the
third [INAUDIBLE]",00:59:47.880,00:59:49.490
"co-efficient we compute to be
1/8 minus 2 3 to the 5/2 lambda",00:59:49.490,00:59:58.660
cubed over g squared.,00:59:58.660,01:00:02.390
"And you can keep
going and calculate",01:00:02.390,01:00:05.350
"higher and higher
order corrections.",01:00:05.350,01:00:07.540
AUDIENCE: Question.,01:00:10.869,01:00:11.660
PROFESSOR: Yes.,01:00:11.660,01:00:12.620
"AUDIENCE: So if you're doing
this expansion for the z being",01:00:12.620,01:00:16.225
close to 0--,01:00:16.225,01:00:16.745
PROFESSOR: Yes.,01:00:16.745,01:00:17.370
"AUDIENCE: --it appears
that chemical potential",01:00:17.370,01:00:19.286
is a large negative number.,01:00:19.286,01:00:20.490
PROFESSOR: Yes.,01:00:20.490,01:00:22.020
"AUDIENCE: What
kind of interaction",01:00:22.020,01:00:24.580
"does it imply between our
grand canonical and [INAUDIBLE]",01:00:24.580,01:00:28.240
"and the system from
which it takes particles?",01:00:28.240,01:00:30.240
"Because chemical potential
represents energy threshold",01:00:34.740,01:00:37.990
"for the particle to
move from there to--",01:00:37.990,01:00:40.237
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:00:40.237,01:00:40.820
"So as you say, it corresponds
to being large and negative.",01:00:40.820,01:00:47.650
"Which means that,
essentially, I think",01:00:47.650,01:00:52.940
"the more kind of physical way
of looking at it is-- this z",01:00:52.940,01:00:57.550
"is e to the beta mu-- is
the likelihood of grabbing",01:00:57.550,01:01:01.980
"and adding one particle
to your system.",01:01:01.980,01:01:04.800
"And what we have is that this
is much, much less than 1.",01:01:04.800,01:01:09.470
"And the way to
achieve that is to say",01:01:09.470,01:01:11.610
"that it is very hard to extract
and bring in other particle",01:01:11.610,01:01:16.080
"from whatever
reservoir you have.",01:01:16.080,01:01:18.510
"And because it is
so hard that you",01:01:18.510,01:01:20.840
"have such low density of
particles in the system",01:01:20.840,01:01:24.020
that you have.,01:01:24.020,01:01:25.000
"So for example, if you are in
vacuum and you put a surface,",01:01:25.000,01:01:30.390
"and some atoms from
the surface detach",01:01:30.390,01:01:33.360
"and form a gas in
your container,",01:01:33.360,01:01:36.390
"the energetics of
binding those atoms",01:01:36.390,01:01:39.140
"to the substrate particles
was huge and few of them",01:01:39.140,01:01:42.760
managed to escape.,01:01:42.760,01:01:43.510
OK?,01:01:50.980,01:01:51.480
All right.,01:02:03.480,01:02:04.250
But this is only one limit.,01:02:04.250,01:02:06.600
"And this is the limit
that we already knew.",01:02:06.600,01:02:09.990
"We are really interested
in the other limit",01:02:09.990,01:02:13.450
where we are quantum dominated.,01:02:13.450,01:02:16.000
"And clearly we want
to go to the limit",01:02:16.000,01:02:18.900
"where the argument
here is not small.",01:02:18.900,01:02:22.930
"I have to include a large
number of terms in this series.",01:02:22.930,01:02:26.650
"And then I have to
figure out what happens.",01:02:26.650,01:02:28.500
"I mean, how do I have
to treat the cases where",01:02:28.500,01:02:32.960
"I want to solve this equation
and the left hand side, d, is",01:02:32.960,01:02:41.970
a large number?,01:02:41.970,01:02:44.360
"So how can I make the value
of the function large?",01:02:44.360,01:02:49.820
"What does that imply about
argument of the function?",01:02:49.820,01:02:53.263
OK?,01:02:53.263,01:02:54.170
"So different functions
will become large",01:02:54.170,01:02:57.070
"for different values
of the argument.",01:02:57.070,01:03:00.080
"And as we will show
for the case of bosons,",01:03:00.080,01:03:04.510
"these functions become large
where the argument becomes 1.",01:03:04.510,01:03:08.485
"Whereas, for fermions, they
become large when the argument",01:03:08.485,01:03:12.450
itself becomes very large.,01:03:12.450,01:03:15.020
"So the behavior of these
functions is very different.",01:03:15.020,01:03:17.910
"When they become
large they become",01:03:17.910,01:03:19.610
"large at different
points when we",01:03:19.610,01:03:21.765
"are thinking about
bosons and fermions.",01:03:21.765,01:03:24.550
"And because of
that, at this stage",01:03:24.550,01:03:26.370
"I have to separately
address the two problems.",01:03:26.370,01:03:29.600
"So up to here, the
high temperature limit,",01:03:29.600,01:03:32.530
"we sort of started
from the same point",01:03:32.530,01:03:35.160
"and branched off slightly by
going into boson and fermion",01:03:35.160,01:03:38.550
direction.,01:03:38.550,01:03:39.500
"But when I go to
the other limit,",01:03:39.500,01:03:41.090
"I have to discuss the
two cases separately.",01:03:41.090,01:03:44.050
"So let's start with
the case of fermions.",01:03:44.050,01:03:48.452
"So degenerate-- degenerating
a sense of d being larger",01:04:12.860,01:04:23.510
"than 1 rather than
character flaws.",01:04:23.510,01:04:27.820
So what do we do in this limit?,01:04:27.820,01:04:31.380
"So what I need to know is to
look at one of these functions.",01:04:34.370,01:04:39.450
"So let's say d n lambda
cubed over g is f 3/2 minus",01:04:39.450,01:04:49.460
"of z which is 1 over this
1/2 factorial integral 0",01:04:49.460,01:04:56.970
to infinity dx x to the 1/2.,01:04:56.970,01:05:03.590
"And here I have a
plus because I'm",01:05:03.590,01:05:05.840
"looking at the fermionic
version of these.",01:05:05.840,01:05:09.300
"I have z inverse e to the
x and I can write that as e",01:05:09.300,01:05:14.230
to the x minus log z.,01:05:14.230,01:05:18.652
OK?,01:05:18.652,01:05:19.152
"Now, essentially, if I look
at this function-- actually,",01:05:24.350,01:05:30.400
"let's look at the function
that is just 1 over e",01:05:30.400,01:05:37.370
"to the x minus log z plus
1 as a function of x.",01:05:37.370,01:05:46.450
"What does it do in the
limit where z is large?",01:05:46.450,01:05:51.510
"In the limit where z is large,
log z is also very large.",01:05:51.510,01:05:56.370
"And then what I
have is something",01:05:56.370,01:06:00.990
"that if x is much less
than log z-- essentially,",01:06:00.990,01:06:06.300
"this factor will
be 0 and I have 1.",01:06:06.300,01:06:11.600
"Whereas if x is much
greater than log z,",01:06:11.600,01:06:15.540
"then this is exponentially large
quantity and I will have 0.",01:06:15.540,01:06:19.880
"So basically, at
around log z, this",01:06:19.880,01:06:24.540
"switches from being very
close to 0 to being 1.",01:06:24.540,01:06:28.480
"Indeed, that x equals
2 log z is exactly 1/2.",01:06:28.480,01:06:32.740
So here is 1/2.,01:06:32.740,01:06:34.960
It is switching very rapidly.,01:06:34.960,01:06:37.440
"And you can see
that, essentially,",01:06:40.850,01:06:43.770
"the value of the function
depends on the combination",01:06:43.770,01:06:48.210
x minus log z.,01:06:48.210,01:06:51.030
"So if I were to make
log z much larger,",01:06:51.030,01:06:54.960
"I'm essentially transporting
this combination",01:06:54.960,01:06:59.390
"without changing its shape,
either in one direction",01:06:59.390,01:07:02.750
or the other direction.,01:07:02.750,01:07:05.220
OK?,01:07:05.220,01:07:07.450
"And if I go to the limit,
essentially that log z is",01:07:07.450,01:07:11.430
"very large, I will have 1
for a huge distance and then,",01:07:11.430,01:07:16.290
"at some point, I
would switch to 0.",01:07:16.290,01:07:20.080
"And what I'm doing, therefore,
is to essentially approximately",01:07:20.080,01:07:25.300
"integrating from 0 to
log z x to the 1/2 dx.",01:07:25.300,01:07:32.680
"Which would give me x to the
3/2-- sorry, log z to the 3/2",01:07:32.680,01:07:39.531
over 3/2.,01:07:39.531,01:07:40.030
"And you can see
that I can repeat",01:07:45.190,01:07:46.750
"this for any other
value of m here.",01:07:46.750,01:07:50.870
"I would be integrating
x to the m minus 1.",01:07:50.870,01:07:54.690
"So you would conclude that the
limit as z is much, much larger",01:07:54.690,01:08:00.930
"than 1, of one of these
functions fm minus of z,",01:08:00.930,01:08:08.390
"is obtained by integrating
0 to log z dx x to the m.",01:08:08.390,01:08:12.890
"I will get another
factor of log z.",01:08:12.890,01:08:15.630
"And then I will get
log z to the power",01:08:15.630,01:08:20.439
"of m divided by 1
over m multiplying",01:08:20.439,01:08:24.359
by 1 over m minus 1 factorial.,01:08:24.359,01:08:26.960
It will give me m factorial.,01:08:26.960,01:08:28.390
"Now, of course there will
be correction to this",01:08:35.020,01:08:40.590
"because this function
would be equal to this",01:08:40.590,01:08:44.510
"if I was integrating
a step function.",01:08:44.510,01:08:49.029
"And I don't have
a step function.",01:08:49.029,01:08:50.630
"I have something that
gradually vanishes.",01:08:50.630,01:08:53.350
"Although, the interval
over which it vanishes",01:08:53.350,01:08:56.460
"is scaling much
smaller than log z.",01:08:56.460,01:09:00.180
"So what you can do, is you
can do some manipulations",01:09:00.180,01:09:04.510
"and calculate corrections
to this formula that",01:09:04.510,01:09:08.899
"become significant as log
z is not exactly infinite",01:09:08.899,01:09:14.250
but becomes smaller and smaller.,01:09:14.250,01:09:16.390
"It turns out that that will
generate for you a series that",01:09:16.390,01:09:20.450
is inverse powers of log z.,01:09:20.450,01:09:23.340
"And in fact, inverse
even powers of log z.",01:09:23.340,01:09:27.760
"So that the next term will fall
off as 1 over log z squared.",01:09:27.760,01:09:31.760
"The next term will fall off
as 1 over z to the fourth",01:09:31.760,01:09:36.390
and so forth.,01:09:36.390,01:09:39.609
"And the coefficient of
the first one-- and I",01:09:39.609,01:09:43.350
"show you this in the notes,
how to calculate it--",01:09:43.350,01:09:46.550
"is pi squared over
6 times m m minus 1.",01:09:46.550,01:09:50.800
"The coefficient of
the next term is",01:09:50.800,01:09:53.082
"7 pi to the fourth 360 m m
minus 1, m minus 2, m minus 3.",01:09:53.082,01:10:02.730
"And there's a formula
for subsequent terms",01:10:02.730,01:10:05.740
"in the series, how
they are generated.",01:10:05.740,01:10:08.740
"And this thing is known as
the Sommerfeld expansion.",01:10:08.740,01:10:11.940
OK?,01:10:23.083,01:10:23.583
"So, essentially, if you
plot as a function of z one",01:10:28.030,01:10:38.290
"of these fm minuses of
z's, what we have according",01:10:38.290,01:10:43.670
"to the previous
expansion, as you go to z",01:10:43.670,01:10:48.110
"equals to 0 you have
a linear function z.",01:10:48.110,01:10:52.350
"And then the next correction
is minus z squared.",01:10:52.350,01:10:55.240
"You start to bend
in this direction.",01:10:55.240,01:10:57.920
"And then you have higher
order corrections.",01:10:57.920,01:11:00.540
"What we see, that at larger
values, it keeps growing.",01:11:00.540,01:11:04.340
"And the growth at
larger values is this.",01:11:04.340,01:11:07.850
"So here you have z minus z
squared 2 to the power of m.",01:11:07.850,01:11:12.815
"Out here you have log z
to the m over m factorial.",01:11:12.815,01:11:18.150
"And then this corrections
from the Sommerfeld expansion.",01:11:18.150,01:11:22.980
OK?,01:11:22.980,01:11:24.710
"And so once we
have that function,",01:11:24.710,01:11:28.700
"which is the right hand
side of this equality,",01:11:28.700,01:11:33.630
"for a particular density we are
asking, what is the value of z?",01:11:33.630,01:11:39.440
"And at low densities we are
evaluating solutions here.",01:11:39.440,01:11:45.210
"At high values of
density we are picking up",01:11:45.210,01:11:49.250
solutions on this other.,01:11:49.250,01:11:52.250
OK?,01:11:52.250,01:11:54.270
"So let's imagine that we
are indeed in that limit.",01:11:54.270,01:11:58.810
So what do we have?,01:11:58.810,01:12:01.250
"We have that n lambda
cubed over g is log z",01:12:01.250,01:12:13.360
to the 3/2 over 3/2 factorial.,01:12:13.360,01:12:18.240
That's the leading term.,01:12:18.240,01:12:21.080
"Sub-leading term is 1
plus pi squared over 6.",01:12:21.080,01:12:26.920
"m, in our case, is 3/2.",01:12:26.920,01:12:29.870
"m minus 1 would be 1/2
divided by log z squared.",01:12:29.870,01:12:35.480
I will stop at this order.,01:12:35.480,01:12:36.850
That's all we will need.,01:12:36.850,01:12:40.120
"And so I will use this to
calculate z as a function n.",01:12:40.120,01:12:45.670
"Again, same procedure as before.",01:12:45.670,01:12:48.090
"I can invert this
and write this as log",01:12:48.090,01:12:50.610
"z being 3/2 factorial
n lambda cubed over g.",01:12:50.610,01:12:58.905
so I multiplied by this.,01:12:58.905,01:13:01.170
"I have to raise to the 2/3
power-- the inverse of 3/2.",01:13:01.170,01:13:06.580
"I take this combination
to the other side.",01:13:06.580,01:13:09.260
So I have 1.,01:13:09.260,01:13:11.250
"This becomes plus pi
squared over 8 1 over log z",01:13:11.250,01:13:17.440
"squared raised to
the minus 2/3 power",01:13:17.440,01:13:21.280
"because I had to take
it to the other side.",01:13:21.280,01:13:24.157
OK.,01:13:28.447,01:13:28.947
"So at the lowest order,
what I need to do",01:13:32.790,01:13:40.270
"is to calculate log z from the
zeroed order term and then,",01:13:40.270,01:13:46.100
"at the next order, substitute
that value of log z in here",01:13:46.100,01:13:52.220
and get the next correction.,01:13:52.220,01:13:54.740
"So the lowest order correction

OK?,01:19:09.880,01:19:11.120
"So when you divide 4pi

So kf is 1/3 of that.,01:19:45.493,01:19:48.934
Let's go step by step.,01:19:48.934,01:19:50.656
"A is 6pi squared n
over g to the 1/3.",01:19:50.656,01:19:55.870

"AUDIENCE: So you said that
this is the lowest order",01:20:02.290,01:20:04.460

PROFESSOR: Exactly.,01:20:06.069,01:20:06.860
Yes.,01:20:06.860,01:20:07.360
"AUDIENCE: But aren't there
going to be maybe a second order",01:20:07.360,01:20:10.370

PROFESSOR: Yes.,01:20:12.290,01:20:13.160
"So when we substitute
that formula in here,",01:20:13.160,01:20:17.780
"we will find the value of
the chemical potential.",01:20:17.780,01:20:21.140
"So I will draw it
for you and then",01:20:21.140,01:20:23.440
recalculate the result later.,01:20:23.440,01:20:25.630

chemical potential",01:20:25.630,01:20:27.680
"of the Fermi system as a
function of its temperature.",01:20:27.680,01:20:32.960
What did we establish so far?,01:20:32.960,01:20:35.280
"We established that
at zero temperature",01:20:35.280,01:20:37.195
it is in fact epsilon f.,01:20:37.195,01:20:40.480
"We had established that
at high temperature--",01:20:40.480,01:20:42.790
"this was the discussion
we had before-- it's",01:20:42.790,01:20:44.740
large and negative.,01:20:44.740,01:20:45.990
It is down here.,01:20:45.990,01:20:48.830
"So indeed the behavior
of the chemical potential",01:20:48.830,01:20:52.090
"of the Fermi gas as a
function of temperature",01:20:52.090,01:20:55.830
is something like this.,01:20:55.830,01:20:58.200
"And so the chemical potential at
zero temperature is epsilon f.",01:20:58.200,01:21:03.420
"As you go to finite temperature,
it will get reduced by a factor",01:21:03.420,01:21:08.290
that I will just calculate.,01:21:08.290,01:21:10.925
OK?,01:21:10.925,01:21:12.830
"So if I now substitute
this result in here",01:21:12.830,01:21:19.050
"to get the next
correction, what do I have?",01:21:19.050,01:21:21.350
OK.,01:21:21.350,01:21:21.850
"So this zero to order
term we established",01:21:21.850,01:21:25.090
"is the same thing
as beta epsilon f.",01:21:25.090,01:21:28.965
"And then the next order term
will be 1 plus-- this log",01:21:31.550,01:21:38.480
"z is going to be small--
minus 2/3 times this",01:21:38.480,01:21:42.850
"is going to give me
minus pi squared over 6.",01:21:42.850,01:21:46.455
Right?,01:21:49.880,01:21:50.860
"And then I have 1
over log z squared.",01:21:50.860,01:21:53.970
"One over log z is simply
1 over beta epsilon f",01:21:53.970,01:21:59.830
"which is the same thing as
kT over epsilon f squared So",01:21:59.830,01:22:08.880
"what we see is that the
chemical potential starts",01:22:08.880,01:22:16.780
"to be epsilon f and then it
starts to go down parabolically",01:22:16.780,01:22:22.310
in temperature.,01:22:22.310,01:22:25.180
"And the first correction is of
the order of kT over epsilon f.",01:22:25.180,01:22:30.300
"Not surprisingly,
it will go to 0",01:22:30.300,01:22:34.110
"at the value T that is off the
order of epsilon f over kT.",01:22:34.110,01:22:42.040
"So the chemical potential
of the Fermi gas",01:22:42.040,01:22:44.310
actually changes sign.,01:22:44.310,01:22:45.850
"It's negative and large
at high temperature,",01:22:45.850,01:22:48.890
"it goes to the
Fermi energy which",01:22:48.890,01:22:50.810
is positive at low temperatures.,01:22:50.810,01:22:54.820
"So once we know this behavior
or the chemical potential,",01:22:54.820,01:23:00.270
"we can calculate what the
energy and pressure on.",01:23:00.270,01:23:04.810
"And again, at zero
temperature you",01:23:04.810,01:23:07.630
"will have some energy which
comes from filling out",01:23:07.630,01:23:10.360
"this Fermi C. And then we
will get corrections to energy",01:23:10.360,01:23:15.430
"and pressure that
we can calculate",01:23:15.430,01:23:19.030
"using the types of
formulas that we have that",01:23:19.030,01:23:21.970
"relate pressure and
energy to f 5/2 of z.",01:23:21.970,01:23:27.180
"And so we can start to
calculate the corrections",01:23:27.180,01:23:30.420
"that you have to
completely Fermi sphere.",01:23:30.420,01:23:33.940
"And how those
corrections give you,",01:23:33.940,01:23:35.750
"say, the linear heat
capacity is something",01:23:35.750,01:23:38.690
that we will derive next time.,01:23:38.690,01:23:41.046
