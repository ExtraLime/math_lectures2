Computational complexity",00:00:22.272,00:00:23.730
"is basically about how
hard is a problem, right?",00:00:23.730,00:00:27.167
"There are some problems
that are really easy",00:00:27.167,00:00:29.000

that are really hard.",00:00:29.000,00:00:31.310

line on the board",00:00:31.310,00:00:34.130

that we can possibly have?",00:00:41.990,00:00:44.630
"AUDIENCE: It was chess, right?",00:00:47.822,00:00:49.190

"PROFESSOR: No, there's
something beyond chess.",00:00:50.980,00:00:53.784
AUDIENCE: A halting problem?,00:00:53.784,00:00:54.950
PROFESSOR: Halting problem.,00:00:54.950,00:00:55.256
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:00:55.256,00:00:55.881
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:00:55.881,00:00:56.600
"Halting problem
is somewhere here.",00:00:56.600,00:00:58.530
"So what's the best solution
for the halting problem?",00:01:03.830,00:01:08.710
Running time.,00:01:08.710,00:01:10.006
"AUDIENCE: It is
exponential, or something?",00:01:10.006,00:01:11.755
PROFESSOR: You'd wish.,00:01:11.755,00:01:13.332
AUDIENCE: Oh really?,00:01:13.332,00:01:14.165
It's not even exponential?,00:01:14.165,00:01:15.590
"AUDIENCE: I think
there's like no solution.",00:01:15.590,00:01:17.970
"PROFESSOR: There is no solution

"you cannot solve
the halting problem.",00:01:23.610,00:01:25.420
It's undesignable.,00:01:25.420,00:01:27.080
"So this is the worst kind of
problem you can come up with.",00:01:27.080,00:01:30.617
"AUDIENCE: What exactly
is the halting problem?",00:01:30.617,00:01:32.802
"PROFESSOR: So halting
problem is given",00:01:32.802,00:01:35.210
"a program in any representation
that makes sense to you,",00:01:35.210,00:01:38.100
"machine language, CE, assembly,
parsing tree, whatever",00:01:38.100,00:01:41.680
"you want, decide if
it terminates or not.",00:01:41.680,00:01:46.250
"Sounds really simple, right?",00:01:46.250,00:01:48.080
"Turns out there's a proof that
says it's impossible to solve.",00:01:48.080,00:01:51.910
"So you can't say will terminate
or will not terminate.",00:01:51.910,00:01:54.900
"AUDIENCE: Well, but for some
programs, it's like while true,",00:01:54.900,00:01:58.365
but there's no break.,00:01:58.365,00:02:00.290
PROFESSOR: So Turing Machine.,00:02:00.290,00:02:02.251
Yeah.,00:02:02.251,00:02:02.750
"If you have a machine where
you're not allowed loops,",00:02:02.750,00:02:04.958
"then it's easy to know
what's going to happen.",00:02:04.958,00:02:07.331
"So you need to have a
Turing machine, something",00:02:07.331,00:02:09.289
that allows loops.,00:02:09.289,00:02:10.810
"So some instances
are easy, right?",00:02:10.810,00:02:12.960
"But for the general
case of you have",00:02:12.960,00:02:14.840
"to write a program that gets
another program and outputs",00:02:14.840,00:02:18.470
"this bit, we don't
know how to do that.",00:02:18.470,00:02:21.550
"But we've proven that nobody
will know how to do that,",00:02:21.550,00:02:24.590
so we're OK with it.,00:02:24.590,00:02:26.827
So this means undecidable.,00:02:26.827,00:02:27.910
"We know that nobody will
ever be able to solve this.",00:02:30.950,00:02:34.039
"So if you're given the halting
problem on an interview,",00:02:34.039,00:02:36.330
"it's safe to laugh in the
guy's face and tell them,",00:02:36.330,00:02:38.642
"why don't you show
me how to do it?",00:02:38.642,00:02:40.100
"So what is better
than undecidable?",00:02:43.590,00:02:46.200
"There are these problems here
that are outright impossible.",00:02:46.200,00:02:51.070
What's the next best thing?,00:02:51.070,00:02:54.056
AUDIENCE: Chess?,00:02:54.056,00:02:55.892
"I know chess is in
there somewhere.",00:02:55.892,00:02:57.730
PROFESSOR: Chess is still here.,00:02:57.730,00:02:59.430
"There's something
harder than that.",00:02:59.430,00:03:03.140
"AUDIENCE: Is it R, or
something like that?",00:03:03.140,00:03:05.675
PROFESSOR: Yup.,00:03:05.675,00:03:06.300
"So this is the boundary
for R and this whole thing",00:03:10.380,00:03:13.020
is R. What R?,00:03:13.020,00:03:16.350
"R is-- so if these
are undecidable,",00:03:16.350,00:03:19.110
"R means decidable, right?",00:03:19.110,00:03:20.430
"So you can write an algorithm
that will compute the answer",00:03:20.430,00:03:25.850
"and do that in a
finite amount of time.",00:03:25.850,00:03:29.210
"Will the world end before
the algorithm ends?",00:03:29.210,00:03:31.490
"Maybe, who knows.",00:03:31.490,00:03:33.180
"But at least there's a
finite amount of time,",00:03:33.180,00:03:35.210
"so the problem can
be solved somehow.",00:03:35.210,00:03:39.190
That means R.,00:03:39.190,00:03:40.050
"AUDIENCE: R is like,
real, like it's not.",00:03:40.050,00:03:43.770
"PROFESSOR: Real, OK.",00:03:43.770,00:03:44.790
"AUDIENCE: So like numbers,
like, you know, real numbers--",00:03:44.790,00:03:47.360
"PROFESSOR: So you know it
actually comes from recursive,",00:03:47.360,00:03:49.760
"because some old people
decided that recursive",00:03:49.760,00:03:52.320
"means it terminates
at some point.",00:03:52.320,00:03:55.820
"This is really old
school stuff, 1940.",00:03:55.820,00:03:59.570
"So R actually stands
for recursive.",00:03:59.570,00:04:03.350
"Just know that R
means decidable.",00:04:03.350,00:04:06.710
"Weird abbreviation, but oh well.",00:04:06.710,00:04:09.132
AUDIENCE: I'll go with real.,00:04:09.132,00:04:10.780
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:04:10.780,00:04:12.200
What's next?,00:04:12.200,00:04:12.830
"So some problems are
in R. All the ones",00:04:12.830,00:04:16.000
that we care about are in r.,00:04:16.000,00:04:19.230
So what's better than r?,00:04:19.230,00:04:20.900
"R means it's going to
terminate at some point,",00:04:20.900,00:04:22.930
"there is a running
time for the problem.",00:04:22.930,00:04:24.950
What's the better than that?,00:04:24.950,00:04:26.360
"Exponential, OK.",00:04:26.360,00:04:28.180
What does exponential mean?,00:04:28.180,00:04:30.709
AUDIENCE: Exponential?,00:04:30.709,00:04:31.625
PROFESSOR: Yup.,00:04:35.850,00:04:36.990
"So the running time
looks like what?",00:04:36.990,00:04:40.303
"AUDIENCE: 2 to the 10, or
something constant to the n?",00:04:40.303,00:04:45.213
2 to the n of the C?,00:04:45.213,00:04:48.480
"PROFESSOR: For some
constant C, right?",00:04:48.480,00:04:51.030
So it's not just 2 to the n.,00:04:51.030,00:04:53.230
"The moment you
have a 2 to the n,",00:04:53.230,00:04:54.930
"we're like, OK,
if you're already",00:04:54.930,00:04:56.310
"in this bad of a
situation, I don't",00:04:56.310,00:04:58.480
care if this is a polynomial.,00:04:58.480,00:05:00.790
"I don't care if it's
an n or n to the 100,",00:05:00.790,00:05:02.982
"you're already
pretty much screwed,",00:05:02.982,00:05:04.440
"you're not going to solve
this before the world ends.",00:05:04.440,00:05:07.690
"So that's what
exponential means.",00:05:07.690,00:05:09.979
"Going to solve it, but
not before the world",00:05:09.979,00:05:11.770
"ends for most
practical problems.",00:05:11.770,00:05:15.830
What's better than exponential?,00:05:15.830,00:05:18.956
AUDIENCE: NP.,00:05:18.956,00:05:19.914
"PROFESSOR: OK, and
before we talk about NP,",00:05:25.179,00:05:26.970
"let's talk about the
easy case, the problems",00:05:26.970,00:05:28.880
"that we've talked about all
the time in the semester.",00:05:28.880,00:05:31.115
"AUDIENCE: May I ask
you a stupid question?",00:05:31.115,00:05:33.238
What does NP stand for?,00:05:33.238,00:05:35.867
"PROFESSOR: It's not
a stupid question.",00:05:35.867,00:05:37.450
It has a really hard to answer.,00:05:37.450,00:05:39.450
"So the one-sentence
answer is NP stands",00:05:39.450,00:05:43.830
for non deterministic binomial.,00:05:43.830,00:05:45.700
"And we're going to go
over that at some point",00:05:45.700,00:05:48.251
in the next few minutes.,00:05:48.251,00:05:49.250
"OK, so what problems
have we talked about?",00:06:04.480,00:06:06.760
"All the terms, except
for one problem,",00:06:06.760,00:06:08.810
"for the knapsack
problem, the entire term",00:06:08.810,00:06:11.042
"we talked about some
sort of problems.",00:06:11.042,00:06:12.625
Polynomial.,00:06:15.770,00:06:16.410
"These are the
reasonably easy ones.",00:06:16.410,00:06:20.270
"So polynomial problems are those
where t of n is n to the C,",00:06:20.270,00:06:32.830
so it's a binomial.,00:06:32.830,00:06:34.640
"The running time is a binomial
in terms of the input sites.",00:06:34.640,00:06:38.420
Why does this matter?,00:06:38.420,00:06:40.050
"If you have a
polynomial algorithm,",00:06:40.050,00:06:42.930
"than if you double the
input, then the running time",00:06:42.930,00:06:48.260
"is going to be 2 to
the C times n to the C.",00:06:48.260,00:06:52.870
"So every time you
double the input,",00:06:52.870,00:06:54.460
"the running time will
increase by a constant factor.",00:06:54.460,00:06:57.510
And you know what that is.,00:06:57.510,00:07:00.510
"If your problem is exponential,
then if you double the input,",00:07:00.510,00:07:04.320
"then the running time
increases quadratically.",00:07:04.320,00:07:08.180
It's not a linear increase.,00:07:08.180,00:07:09.990
Here it's a linear increase.,00:07:09.990,00:07:11.185
"The factor isn't 2, but it's
still a linear increase.",00:07:14.890,00:07:17.710
Make sense?,00:07:20.610,00:07:22.230
"So that's why we like
these problems, at least",00:07:22.230,00:07:24.210
"we like them more
than anything else.",00:07:24.210,00:07:27.900
"So polynomial problems
are the nice and easy ones",00:07:27.900,00:07:30.360
that we've talked about so far.,00:07:30.360,00:07:33.740
What does NP stand for?,00:07:33.740,00:07:35.770
Give me a practical definition.,00:07:35.770,00:07:39.257
"AUDIENCE: You can
check it [INAUDIBLE].",00:07:39.257,00:07:40.882
"PROFESSOR: OK, so NP means
that we can write the verifier.",00:07:46.350,00:07:49.015
"I'm going to say exactly what
you said with different words.",00:07:52.660,00:07:56.540
"That takes a solution
to the problem.",00:07:56.540,00:07:58.440
"And of course, it has to
think the input to the problem",00:08:04.420,00:08:09.150
"and tells us is it correct
or is it not correct.",00:08:09.150,00:08:13.590
And this very fire is NP.,00:08:16.430,00:08:20.280
"So the very fire runs
in polynomial time.",00:08:20.280,00:08:22.020
Yes.,00:08:27.160,00:08:27.660
"So if the verifier runs
in polynomial time,",00:08:30.800,00:08:35.350
"what's the solution size
and what's the input size?",00:08:35.350,00:08:38.070
"AUDIENCE: I think the-- I mean,
the solution said it's like 01,",00:08:42.282,00:08:46.000
right?,00:08:46.000,00:08:47.889
"PROFESSOR: If we have
decision problems.",00:08:47.889,00:08:49.555
"An algorithm that
solves an NP problem.",00:08:52.520,00:08:54.460
"If you run it
against the verifier,",00:08:54.460,00:08:56.700
"also has to convince you
that its answer is correct.",00:08:56.700,00:09:01.060
"So the problems that we
talked about in class",00:09:01.060,00:09:04.420
"were decidability problems
where you have to say,",00:09:04.420,00:09:06.750
is it possible to do this?,00:09:06.750,00:09:08.000
Yes or no.,00:09:08.000,00:09:09.414
"When you have a
verifier with you,",00:09:09.414,00:09:10.830
"then you have to output a string
that convinces the verifier",00:09:10.830,00:09:13.750
that your answer is correct.,00:09:13.750,00:09:16.710
"So like if you
have a problem that",00:09:16.710,00:09:18.650
"says-- if you have three
sets, for example-- that says,",00:09:18.650,00:09:23.970
"given a logical expression, can
you assign variable values such",00:09:23.970,00:09:29.380
that the expression is true?,00:09:29.380,00:09:31.090
"If I say yes, what
does that mean?",00:09:31.090,00:09:32.950
That means nothing.,00:09:32.950,00:09:34.060
"How do I convince you
that my answer is correct?",00:09:34.060,00:09:37.140
"I will have to give you
the assignment, right?",00:09:37.140,00:09:39.970
"And then you can verify
in polynomial time",00:09:39.970,00:09:42.960
if my answer is right or not.,00:09:42.960,00:09:46.580
"So the input to the
verifier, this solution,",00:09:46.580,00:09:49.240
is not necessarily the decision.,00:09:49.240,00:09:51.570
"It's not just the
bit, yes or no.",00:09:51.570,00:09:52.990
"So if the verifier runs
in polynomial time,",00:09:56.720,00:09:59.400
"what's true about
the problem input",00:09:59.400,00:10:01.600
"and what's true about
the problem output which",00:10:01.600,00:10:03.880
"becomes an input
to the verifier?",00:10:03.880,00:10:05.340
"They have to be
polynomial in size.",00:10:12.440,00:10:14.270
"Otherwise, my
algorithm wouldn't be",00:10:14.270,00:10:15.990
"able to consume
them fast enough.",00:10:15.990,00:10:17.510
"So actually, polynomial
means that the running time",00:10:21.840,00:10:26.980
is polynomial in the input size.,00:10:26.980,00:10:28.970
"So the input size is
automatically all set.",00:10:28.970,00:10:31.440
"But the solution has to be
polynomial in the input size",00:10:31.440,00:10:34.650
as well.,00:10:34.650,00:10:35.150
"And if you're thinking
decision problems,",00:10:50.222,00:10:51.930
"you can be more rigorous
and call this a proof.",00:10:51.930,00:10:54.100
"So if this proof is
binomial in the input size,",00:11:04.740,00:11:08.750
"then if I'm really,
really lucky,",00:11:08.750,00:11:12.450
"I can take the
input to a problem,",00:11:12.450,00:11:14.500
"and I can flip coins and use
the corn results as bits,",00:11:14.500,00:11:18.950
"and put them together,
and create the proof.",00:11:18.950,00:11:22.420
"If I'm really, really lucky,
I'll get the right proof.",00:11:22.420,00:11:27.150
"Chances of that
happening almost zero,",00:11:27.150,00:11:29.180
"but if I'm really, really lucky,
conceptually I can get a proof.",00:11:29.180,00:11:33.080
"This is what a non-deterministic
polynomial means.",00:11:33.080,00:11:37.750
"It means that if you have
a magical machine where",00:11:37.750,00:11:40.170
"you can flip a coin, and
it will always be lucky,",00:11:40.170,00:11:44.590
"then you can output the
proof in polynomial time.",00:11:44.590,00:11:47.550
So far so good?,00:11:53.170,00:11:54.040
"So this definition of a machine
that can flip random bits",00:11:57.830,00:12:02.430
"is really useful, because we can
use it to build a common sense",00:12:02.430,00:12:06.630
proof that P is not NP.,00:12:06.630,00:12:08.850
"There is no real rigorous
math proof that P's not NP.",00:12:08.850,00:12:11.870
That's worth a million dollars.,00:12:11.870,00:12:14.036
"There is no proof
that P equals NP.",00:12:14.036,00:12:16.220
"If you have proof
that P equals NP, then",00:12:16.220,00:12:19.030
that's worth a lot more.,00:12:19.030,00:12:20.610
"And I will use that in
the common sense proof",00:12:20.610,00:12:23.010
that I'm going to show you now.,00:12:23.010,00:12:26.660
"So we don't know if P is NP--
get it right-- if P is NP",00:12:26.660,00:12:33.450
or if P is not NP.,00:12:33.450,00:12:37.000
"This is an open problem, and
there's at least $1 million",00:12:37.000,00:12:41.380
worth of prize money for it.,00:12:41.380,00:12:44.140
"Let's talk about
an algorithm where",00:12:47.090,00:12:49.880
"if you would know--
so if you would",00:12:49.880,00:12:51.630
"be able to solve NP
problems in polynomial time,",00:12:51.630,00:12:55.620
"you would be able to
make a lot of money.",00:12:55.620,00:12:59.090
"A million dollars
is nothing compared",00:12:59.090,00:13:00.960
"to what you could make
if you could do that.",00:13:00.960,00:13:02.904
"So I'm going to use
that to convince you",00:13:02.904,00:13:04.570
"that nobody knows how to
solve NP problems in P time.",00:13:04.570,00:13:07.996
"Suppose you want to do
something really bad.",00:13:13.620,00:13:15.460
"Suppose you want to
impersonate a bank.",00:13:15.460,00:13:18.370
"So you guys probably
imagine that banks nowadays",00:13:18.370,00:13:21.280
"don't transfer
money to each other",00:13:21.280,00:13:22.710
"by sending trucks
with gold bars.",00:13:22.710,00:13:26.410
"They do that every once in
awhile, but most of the time",00:13:26.410,00:13:29.200
"the transfers happen very
quickly over the internet.",00:13:29.200,00:13:31.620
"So banks have a
secure connection,",00:13:31.620,00:13:33.180
"and they say, yo, give
me a billion dollars.",00:13:33.180,00:13:35.766
"I'll give it back to
you in a few days.",00:13:35.766,00:13:37.390
Sure.,00:13:37.390,00:13:37.889
Done deal.,00:13:37.889,00:13:39.320
"Now imagine what
you could do if you",00:13:39.320,00:13:40.820
"could impersonate
one of those banks.",00:13:40.820,00:13:43.490
"Sweet happy life in some
faraway place, right?",00:13:43.490,00:13:47.310
"What would it take to
impersonate another bank?",00:13:50.160,00:13:52.790
"It turns out that the
encryption algorithm that",00:13:52.790,00:13:58.680
"use to secure this links
is an algorithm called RSA.",00:13:58.680,00:14:02.420
Do you guys remember that?,00:14:02.420,00:14:04.070
Heard about it?,00:14:04.070,00:14:04.920
"So in RSA, each
party-- so each bank",00:14:10.560,00:14:14.530
"has a secret key that
consists of two numbers--",00:14:14.530,00:14:17.450
P and Q-- big prime numbers.,00:14:17.450,00:14:20.540
"And say each of these
are N-bit prime numbers.",00:14:23.530,00:14:28.584
"And then they have
a probably key.",00:14:28.584,00:14:30.000
"So they have a
number that announce",00:14:30.000,00:14:31.650
"that is N equals
P times Q. So this",00:14:31.650,00:14:37.110
"is announced to
the entire world.",00:14:37.110,00:14:39.010
This is public.,00:14:39.010,00:14:39.850
"We went through this
[INAUDIBLE] set, right?",00:14:42.047,00:14:43.880
So this rings a bell.,00:14:43.880,00:14:46.610
"They have to announce this
so that the other people can",00:14:46.610,00:14:50.070
encrypt messages for them.,00:14:50.070,00:14:52.490
"If you want someone else to
be able to send you a message,",00:14:52.490,00:14:54.942
you have to tell them your n.,00:14:54.942,00:14:56.150
"Now if you know P and Q,
you can decrypt messages.",00:15:00.510,00:15:03.270
"So you can pretend
you're the bank.",00:15:03.270,00:15:06.650
"Now let's set up a
problem in this way.",00:15:06.650,00:15:09.050
"Given a verifier that
does long division--",00:15:11.630,00:15:16.460
"so we have a verifier that
the verifiers input is N,",00:15:16.460,00:15:22.740
"and some guess P,
P guess, right?",00:15:22.740,00:15:28.530
"So the verifier will
compute N modulo P.",00:15:28.530,00:15:33.260
"And if N modulo P is 0,
then it will say happy.",00:15:33.260,00:15:38.050
"Actually, it will say,
you're rich as hell.",00:15:38.050,00:15:41.280
"If it's not 0, then well,
tough luck, try again.",00:15:41.280,00:15:45.040
"So if you could make
this verifier happy,",00:15:49.040,00:15:51.540
"you could get P. So
given public information,",00:15:51.540,00:15:58.820
"you could get the
private information that",00:15:58.820,00:16:00.790
"would allow you to
impersonate the bank.",00:16:00.790,00:16:03.700
"This is called a factoring
problem by the way.",00:16:03.700,00:16:05.620
"So P and N are
usually 1024 bits.",00:16:14.520,00:16:20.480
"So the chances of doing
that with a coin flip, no.",00:16:20.480,00:16:23.220
"The chances of guessing it
are one in two to the 1024--",00:16:25.810,00:16:34.800
"it's basically worse
than having to pick",00:16:34.800,00:16:36.610
"a random atom in the universe
and choosing the right one.",00:16:36.610,00:16:39.128
So not going to happen.,00:16:41.880,00:16:44.770
"But if you had an algorithm
that takes a verifier",00:16:44.770,00:16:47.640
"and produces an input
that makes it happy,",00:16:47.640,00:16:52.480
"then you would
solve this problem,",00:16:52.480,00:16:56.570
"and you would
impersonate the bank,",00:16:56.570,00:16:58.326
"and you would
become really rich,",00:16:58.326,00:16:59.700
"and then the whole
world's economic system",00:16:59.700,00:17:02.660
"would be in a
terrible situation.",00:17:02.660,00:17:05.059
"AUDIENCE: P and Q
are primes, right?",00:17:09.079,00:17:13.588
"So couldn't you just
find all the primes?",00:17:13.588,00:17:18.079
"PROFESSOR: Well, so look at
it from this perspective,",00:17:18.079,00:17:22.930
"the economic system
still functions.",00:17:22.930,00:17:25.589
"It's not like everyone's
money disappeared somewhere.",00:17:25.589,00:17:29.870
"Therefore, nobody was
able to pull this off.",00:17:29.870,00:17:34.310
"AUDIENCE: Isn't there a
quantum algorithm to do it",00:17:34.310,00:17:36.700
or that's something different?,00:17:36.700,00:17:40.009
"PROFESSOR: So this
assumes Turing machines.",00:17:40.009,00:17:41.800
"We're assuming regular
Turing machines.",00:17:41.800,00:17:43.870
"A quantum computer
breaks that abstraction.",00:17:43.870,00:17:47.340
"For practical purposes, if
you had a quantum computer",00:17:47.340,00:17:50.300
"that can manipulate
this many bits.",00:17:50.300,00:17:52.210
"Then you would break RSA, and
the world would go to hell.",00:17:52.210,00:17:55.020
"So hopefully by the time quantum
computers get this powerful,",00:17:55.020,00:17:58.410
"we'll invent new security
algorithms that replace them.",00:17:58.410,00:18:03.080
"But the fact that eCommerce
works now and that banks work",00:18:03.080,00:18:07.140
"means that nobody
is able to solve",00:18:07.140,00:18:10.500
NP problems in polynomial time.,00:18:10.500,00:18:13.860
"So by the way, factoring is not
the hardest type of NP problem.",00:18:13.860,00:18:18.830
Factoring is somewhere here.,00:18:18.830,00:18:20.230
OK.,00:18:34.381,00:18:34.880
Any questions about this part?,00:18:34.880,00:18:36.130
"AUDIENCE: So factoring
is not an NP problem?",00:18:36.130,00:18:39.540
"PROFESSOR: Factoring
is NP, but it's not",00:18:39.540,00:18:41.400
"the most difficult
type of NP problem.",00:18:41.400,00:18:43.470
We'll get to those right now.,00:18:43.470,00:18:45.110
"So this is a common sense
proof not the math proof",00:18:48.210,00:18:50.850
"that NP is not P--
that at least nobody",00:18:50.850,00:18:56.340
"knows how to solve NP
problems in polynomial time.",00:18:56.340,00:19:01.250

that if you think about it,",00:19:01.250,00:19:05.940

polynomial in size.",00:19:05.940,00:19:08.180
"We can write a verifier
in polynomial time.",00:19:08.180,00:19:10.800

"If you're a very high picture
guy like managerial type,",00:19:14.820,00:19:17.930
"then you might think,
yeah why, can't you guys",00:19:17.930,00:19:19.970
just figure this out?,00:19:19.970,00:19:21.230
Like come up with an algorithm.,00:19:21.230,00:19:23.170
Isn't that what you guys do?,00:19:23.170,00:19:25.132
"Well, so theory people
have been thinking",00:19:25.132,00:19:26.840
about this for 40 years or more.,00:19:26.840,00:19:29.080

you think about something",00:19:29.080,00:19:31.080
"and you can't come
up with a solution?",00:19:31.080,00:19:32.663
AUDIENCE: Say it's impossible?,00:19:35.210,00:19:36.802
"PROFESSOR: You try to
say that it's impossible.",00:19:36.802,00:19:38.760
"So you try to prove
that P is not NP.",00:19:38.760,00:19:41.840
"But if you fail to do that
too, what do you do next?",00:19:41.840,00:19:46.250
"AUDIENCE: Offer
a million dollars",00:19:46.250,00:19:47.625
to someone who can do it.,00:19:47.625,00:19:48.987
PROFESSOR: That too.,00:19:48.987,00:19:49.820
That might help.,00:19:49.820,00:19:50.486
That might help.,00:19:50.486,00:19:52.010
"Well, you complain that it's
really, really hard, right?",00:19:52.010,00:19:54.476
"You want to go back
to your boss or you",00:19:54.476,00:19:56.100
"want to go back to the world,
and say, we thought about this.",00:19:56.100,00:19:58.782
"It is true that with thought
about it for four years,",00:19:58.782,00:20:00.990
"but it's a really,
really hard problem.",00:20:00.990,00:20:04.680
"Well, so for
undecidable problems--",00:20:04.680,00:20:06.649
"so for the whole
thing problems, they",00:20:06.649,00:20:08.190
"are able to convince the world
that nobody can solve this,",00:20:08.190,00:20:10.810
so we're all good.,00:20:10.810,00:20:12.950
"So we couldn't come up with a
solution, because nobody can.",00:20:12.950,00:20:15.880
"Here, we can't prove
that P is not NP yet.",00:20:15.880,00:20:20.040
"So instead the next best
thing that theory people",00:20:20.040,00:20:22.990
"could come up with
is-- they saw,",00:20:22.990,00:20:25.770
"what are the hardest
kind of NP problems?",00:20:25.770,00:20:28.972
"Let's look at them and let's
see if we can solve them",00:20:28.972,00:20:31.180
in some way.,00:20:31.180,00:20:32.590
"And they found
some problems here",00:20:32.590,00:20:34.390
"that are the
hardest NP problems.",00:20:34.390,00:20:36.760
"And they called them
NP-complete problems.",00:20:36.760,00:20:39.570
"And we'll see why
complete in a bit.",00:20:39.570,00:20:41.236
"So these are the hardest NP
problems that you can have.",00:20:48.530,00:20:50.960
Factoring is not one of them.,00:20:50.960,00:20:52.820
"Factoring is not
with the cool kids,",00:20:52.820,00:20:54.890
"even though it
would make you rich.",00:20:54.890,00:20:56.530
"There are some problems
that are harder than that.",00:20:56.530,00:20:59.030
"OK so for these
NP-complete problems,",00:20:59.030,00:21:01.130
"turns out there are a
few hundred of them that",00:21:01.130,00:21:03.740
"would have practical
implications.",00:21:03.740,00:21:06.122
"So you wouldn't be able
to get rich right away,",00:21:06.122,00:21:08.080
"but still you'd be able to
solved the important problems",00:21:08.080,00:21:10.350
"that would save
companies a lot of money.",00:21:10.350,00:21:12.058
"So you think, if
there's a solution",00:21:12.058,00:21:14.380
someone would come up with it.,00:21:14.380,00:21:16.580
"It also turns out that
they're all interrelated.",00:21:16.580,00:21:19.700
"So if you can solve one problem,
you can solve all of them.",00:21:19.700,00:21:22.842
"And you do that
through reductions,",00:21:22.842,00:21:24.300
which we'll go over in a bit.,00:21:24.300,00:21:26.540
"But the bottom line
is there are hundreds",00:21:26.540,00:21:30.690
of NP-complete problems.,00:21:30.690,00:21:32.640
"And if you solve one, then
you solved everything.",00:21:38.990,00:21:42.960
"For now theory people
are trying to say,",00:21:50.904,00:21:52.570
"look there are all
these problems.",00:21:52.570,00:21:55.330
"If anyone would solve
any of them, all of them",00:21:55.330,00:21:57.980
would go away.,00:21:57.980,00:21:58.700
"Nobody was able to
solve any of them,",00:21:58.700,00:22:00.830
"so they must be
really, really hard.",00:22:00.830,00:22:03.340
"This is the best they
could come up with.",00:22:03.340,00:22:05.700
This is NP complete.,00:22:05.700,00:22:06.855
"AUDIENCE: This is same lecture
that you-- any problem that's",00:22:10.221,00:22:12.720

it to solve all the other ones.",00:22:24.590,00:22:29.050

"means that nobody was
able to solve any of them.",00:22:38.310,00:22:41.752
"AUDIENCE: Like there are some
problems like the chess problem",00:22:41.752,00:22:45.230
"that can be solved
exponential time.",00:22:45.230,00:22:47.299
PROFESSOR: Those are different.,00:22:47.299,00:22:48.590
Chess is here.,00:22:48.590,00:22:49.958
"AUDIENCE: So we can solve
chess though, right?",00:22:49.958,00:22:53.660
It's just exponential time.,00:22:53.660,00:22:57.030
Right?,00:22:57.030,00:22:58.932
"PROFESSOR: As far as I know,
because it's exponential time,",00:22:58.932,00:23:01.390
"there's no algorithm
that can actually",00:23:01.390,00:23:03.740
"look at the entire configuration
space, and tell if you can win",00:23:03.740,00:23:07.130
or not.,00:23:07.130,00:23:07.630
"So solving chess, what's chess?",00:23:10.290,00:23:12.580
Chess has given a board.,00:23:12.580,00:23:15.220
"Can I win or not
from this board?",00:23:15.220,00:23:18.270
"This would be very
useful in playing chess,",00:23:18.270,00:23:20.130
"because you start with
the initial board,",00:23:20.130,00:23:21.838
"and then for every
move you can make,",00:23:21.838,00:23:23.470
"you look at the
resulting board, and you",00:23:23.470,00:23:25.136
"say can I win or
not from that board.",00:23:25.136,00:23:27.780
"If you're in a board
configuration in which you",00:23:27.780,00:23:29.890
"can win, you don't want
to go to a configuration",00:23:29.890,00:23:31.960
"where you won't be
able to win anymore.",00:23:31.960,00:23:34.310
"So if you keep doing
this you eventually win.",00:23:34.310,00:23:36.940
"So it would be really nice
to have this algorithm.",00:23:36.940,00:23:40.340
"Yeah, we don't have it.",00:23:40.340,00:23:42.360
"We don't have it and
chess is unsolved.",00:23:42.360,00:23:44.430
Wait.,00:23:44.430,00:23:44.930
"AUDIENCE: So only things
that are below P--",00:23:44.930,00:23:47.180
"but there are some algorithms
that run in exponential time.",00:23:47.180,00:23:49.785
They just take longer.,00:23:49.785,00:23:53.010
"PROFESSOR: So the problem
is what's the input size?",00:23:53.010,00:23:55.540
Exponential in what?,00:23:55.540,00:23:57.090
"If it's going to be-- if the
running time is 2 to the n,",00:23:57.090,00:23:59.630
"and it's 10, then that's fine.",00:23:59.630,00:24:02.540
"But for chess its exponential
in the board configuration.",00:24:02.540,00:24:05.130
"And it turns out that there's
so many board configurations",00:24:05.130,00:24:07.610
"that we don't have
computers fast",00:24:07.610,00:24:10.410
enough to solve the whole thing.,00:24:10.410,00:24:12.040
"So deep blue goes to
a level-- to a depth",00:24:12.040,00:24:14.750
"I think of somewhere around
15 and can barely competes",00:24:14.750,00:24:18.640
"with humans, but it's not
guaranteed to win all the time.",00:24:18.640,00:24:21.230
"So we don't have something that
has completely solved chess.",00:24:21.230,00:24:25.362
"AUDIENCE: So we can only
solve things below P then.",00:24:25.362,00:24:28.560
"PROFESSOR: We can only
solve things below P",00:24:28.560,00:24:30.780
"fast, reasonably fast.",00:24:30.780,00:24:33.082
"So what we care
about in this class",00:24:33.082,00:24:34.540
is how do our algorithm scale.,00:24:34.540,00:24:36.140
So do we have this or not?,00:24:36.140,00:24:38.400
"Does your algorithm
scale or not?",00:24:38.400,00:24:41.460
"The reason we don't like
algorithms that are after this",00:24:41.460,00:24:44.600
"is that for problem sizes that
are really small like 8, 10,",00:24:44.600,00:24:49.750
"or something small,
they're going to work.",00:24:49.750,00:24:52.700
"But the moment the problem
gets bigger and bigger,",00:24:52.700,00:24:56.510
"you're going to run
into a dead end.",00:24:56.510,00:24:58.506
"AUDIENCE: Well, can
you use DP on chess?",00:24:58.506,00:25:01.612
"PROFESSOR: You can
use DP until you",00:25:01.612,00:25:03.070
get to an exponential algorithm.,00:25:03.070,00:25:06.240
"You might get to an
exponential algorithm",00:25:06.240,00:25:08.030
where the exponent is better.,00:25:08.030,00:25:10.280
"So far all the smart
algorithms for chess",00:25:10.280,00:25:12.480
"have reduced the
c here, but they",00:25:12.480,00:25:15.380
"haven't been able to get
away from 2 to the n part.",00:25:15.380,00:25:19.630
"If you make c smaller, sure
it's going to run faster,",00:25:19.630,00:25:21.920
"and you can explore a
bigger part of the board.",00:25:21.920,00:25:23.878
"But you're still not
going to be able to run",00:25:23.878,00:25:26.120
"through the whole thing
before the world ends.",00:25:26.120,00:25:29.870
"That's a good thing
to think about.",00:25:29.870,00:25:31.690
"Will we solve chess
before the world",00:25:31.690,00:25:33.684
"ends with the current
algorithms and machines?",00:25:33.684,00:25:35.600
No.,00:25:35.600,00:25:38.420
AUDIENCE: I guess.,00:25:38.420,00:25:39.830
Remember the Rubik's cube?,00:25:39.830,00:25:41.920
"Wasn't that bordering
exponential or something?",00:25:41.920,00:25:47.310
"I think Eric said that there
is order one solution where",00:25:47.310,00:25:51.830
"the constant factor
is really high.",00:25:51.830,00:25:53.450
So that's different.,00:25:53.450,00:25:55.250
"raises I think Tetris is
here, but the Rubik's cube--",00:25:55.250,00:26:00.830
"AUDIENCE: It's in
the P, isn't it?",00:26:00.830,00:26:02.290
Yeah.,00:26:02.290,00:26:02.790
"PROFESSOR: There's
a solution that's",00:26:02.790,00:26:04.290
"order one with a high
constant [INAUDIBLE].",00:26:04.290,00:26:06.670
"AUDIENCE: But our
brains can play chess.",00:26:06.670,00:26:09.322
PROFESSOR: Sorry?,00:26:09.322,00:26:10.030
Our brains--,00:26:10.030,00:26:10.529
AUDIENCE: We can play chess.,00:26:10.529,00:26:12.030
"PROFESSOR: Well, we can
play reasonably well,",00:26:12.030,00:26:13.905
"but if someone could
play optimally,",00:26:13.905,00:26:15.580
they'd probably beat you.,00:26:15.580,00:26:17.540
Yeah.,00:26:17.540,00:26:20.435
"AUDIENCE: Can someone
play optimally?",00:26:20.435,00:26:23.928
[INAUDIBLE],00:26:23.928,00:26:26.423
"AUDIENCE: What about
machine learning?",00:26:26.423,00:26:30.230
"PROFESSOR: Machine learning
problems are usually here.",00:26:30.230,00:26:34.180
"That's why they don't
scale, and that's",00:26:34.180,00:26:35.880
"why we've seen a lot of
interesting machine learning,",00:26:35.880,00:26:38.230
"but so far I can't talk
to my computer right.",00:26:38.230,00:26:43.104
"They can't make a
lot of progress,",00:26:43.104,00:26:44.520
"because they have these really
hard problems that they're",00:26:44.520,00:26:46.895
working on.,00:26:46.895,00:26:49.470
"AUDIENCE: There's Siri, right.",00:26:49.470,00:26:50.940
You can talk to Siri.,00:26:50.940,00:26:52.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah OK.,00:26:52.900,00:26:54.420
Sure.,00:26:54.420,00:26:55.280
"I think I've seen
on the Internet",00:26:55.280,00:26:57.230
"that it says some
awful things sometimes.",00:26:57.230,00:26:59.400
"So I wouldn't
consider that solved.",00:26:59.400,00:27:03.220
"So what does NP mean to
us like practical terms?",00:27:03.220,00:27:07.920
"Here's how I see it, you're
on an exam or in an interview,",00:27:07.920,00:27:12.040
you start out with a problem.,00:27:12.040,00:27:14.100
"Suppose all the
possible problems",00:27:14.100,00:27:16.330
"are a graph, because
we work with graphs.",00:27:16.330,00:27:19.030
You have your starting problem.,00:27:19.030,00:27:20.324
"This Is the problem that
you're trying to solve now.",00:27:20.324,00:27:22.490
"Then you have a few
destination nodes.",00:27:25.290,00:27:28.200
Say you have merge sort.,00:27:28.200,00:27:30.786
We know how to solve.,00:27:30.786,00:27:31.660
"If you can reduce your
problem to merge sort,",00:27:31.660,00:27:34.950
then you're in a good position.,00:27:34.950,00:27:36.612
You're writing your solution.,00:27:36.612,00:27:37.820
You're out of the room.,00:27:37.820,00:27:39.740
"If you can reduce your problem
to a graph search algorithm,",00:27:39.740,00:27:42.710
"so to BFS or DFS, you're done.",00:27:42.710,00:27:46.270
"If you can reduce it to
shortest path, you're happy.",00:27:46.270,00:27:50.350
You're done.,00:27:50.350,00:27:51.690
"If you can reduce it to a
dynamic programming problem",00:27:51.690,00:27:54.080
"that we understand, you're done.",00:27:54.080,00:27:56.650
"If you can somehow use hashing
or use divide and conquer",00:27:56.650,00:28:00.090
"with an algorithm that we
studied, you're also happy.",00:28:00.090,00:28:03.310
"So we have all these
destination points.",00:28:03.310,00:28:06.257
"And what you're
trying to do is you're",00:28:06.257,00:28:07.840
"trying to get from here all
the way to here via reductions.",00:28:07.840,00:28:11.885
"So suppose you see
three reductions",00:28:15.440,00:28:18.430
that you could possibly do.,00:28:18.430,00:28:19.754
"You don't have time to
work on all three of them,",00:28:22.409,00:28:24.450
"so let's say you
choose the middle one,",00:28:24.450,00:28:26.310
"because this one seems
like it's the easiest one.",00:28:26.310,00:28:28.594
"So I'm going to
guess that this is",00:28:28.594,00:28:30.010
the easiest one I can tackle.,00:28:30.010,00:28:31.456
"So now I'm going
to work on this.",00:28:31.456,00:28:32.830
"I'm going to put the
original problem aside.",00:28:32.830,00:28:34.663
"And I'm going to say if I can
solve this, then I'm happy.",00:28:34.663,00:28:38.490
"Now say this turns into
three more reductions.",00:28:38.490,00:28:42.470
And this one looks promising.,00:28:42.470,00:28:46.027
it's a hard problem.,00:28:46.027,00:28:46.860
You have to do a few reductions.,00:28:46.860,00:28:48.193
It doesn't work right away.,00:28:48.193,00:28:49.690
"But say I take this one
which looks promising,",00:28:49.690,00:28:51.820
"and I'm able to reduce
it to a happy problem.",00:28:51.820,00:28:55.610
"Reduction, reduction, reduction.",00:28:55.610,00:28:57.380
I write this up.,00:28:57.380,00:28:58.550
I'm done.,00:28:58.550,00:29:00.840
"Exam solved or interview
question solved.",00:29:00.840,00:29:04.304
"Now the problem
is what if instead",00:29:04.304,00:29:05.720
"of going on this path which
is reasonably happy, what if I",00:29:05.720,00:29:08.540
"go on a path that
looks like this?",00:29:08.540,00:29:12.080
"All the reductions that
I can see from there",00:29:12.080,00:29:14.760
"go really, really far
away from the problems",00:29:14.760,00:29:17.280
that I know how to solve.,00:29:17.280,00:29:21.190
"Well you're going to
try some reductions,",00:29:21.190,00:29:23.460
"and eventually you're
going to run out of time.",00:29:23.460,00:29:25.790
"And this other interviewer
is going to say, yeah,",00:29:25.790,00:29:27.940
"do you have any
questions about us?",00:29:27.940,00:29:30.000
"Or the exam people will be like,
hey, can we have the exam back?",00:29:30.000,00:29:34.060
We want to go home now.,00:29:34.060,00:29:36.040
So this is a bad outcome.,00:29:36.040,00:29:38.420
"Up until now, all you had
was good destination points.",00:29:38.420,00:29:42.990
"So this is where
you want to reach.",00:29:42.990,00:29:45.330
"Now we have these NP-complete
problems that we know are hard.",00:29:45.330,00:29:49.230
"I've convinced you
hopefully that their hard.",00:29:49.230,00:29:52.230
"So if you know some
NP-complete problems,",00:29:52.230,00:29:54.250
you also have some landmines.,00:29:54.250,00:29:56.420
"You have some places
where if you got there",00:29:56.420,00:29:58.670
"via reductions, not a good path.",00:29:58.670,00:30:03.220
"You want to backtrack and
think of something else.",00:30:03.220,00:30:06.190
"So for example if this
was an NP-complete problem",00:30:06.190,00:30:13.300
"like if this reduction
then was, oh yeah,",00:30:13.300,00:30:17.360
"solve [INAUDIBLE]
in polynomial time.",00:30:17.360,00:30:20.310
Let's see.,00:30:20.310,00:30:21.060
I don't know how to do that.,00:30:21.060,00:30:22.260
The world tried really hard.,00:30:22.260,00:30:23.600
"Maybe I shouldn't try
this avenue on the exam.",00:30:23.600,00:30:26.430
"So if you know that
this is NP-complete.",00:30:26.430,00:30:28.255
You stop right there.,00:30:28.255,00:30:29.260
You don't waste anymore time.,00:30:29.260,00:30:30.480
So this isn't time wasted.,00:30:33.690,00:30:34.970
"If you understand NP-complete,
and you read the CLRS chapter",00:30:38.740,00:30:42.520
on NP-complete problems.,00:30:42.520,00:30:43.760
"Then you also have
some sad faces here.",00:30:43.760,00:30:47.230
"You have some land mines and
you know not to go there.",00:30:47.230,00:30:51.550
"So now your space that
you're looking through",00:30:51.550,00:30:54.250
is a lot more bonded.,00:30:54.250,00:30:57.336
"Hopefully, you're going to
have better chances of finding",00:30:57.336,00:30:59.710
"a happy path, because not only
you have some destinations,",00:30:59.710,00:31:02.700
"but you have some places that
you know you shouldn't go to.",00:31:02.700,00:31:06.870
"So this is the point
of NP-complete.",00:31:06.870,00:31:09.510
"You're probably really
busy at the end of the term",00:31:09.510,00:31:11.840

guessing you're not",00:31:11.840,00:31:13.940

So those will be your landmines.,00:31:46.880,00:31:48.940
Those will be your sad spots.,00:31:48.940,00:31:50.710
"Guaranteed, after you
do that, your interviews",00:31:50.710,00:31:52.660
"will go a lot better,
because you'll",00:31:52.660,00:31:55.450
be faster at solving problems.,00:31:55.450,00:31:56.790
"And that's what we
really care about.",00:31:56.790,00:31:58.331
"So that's why NP-complete
is relevant in real life.",00:32:01.620,00:32:05.960
It gives us these data points.,00:32:05.960,00:32:07.688
Makes sense?,00:32:11.350,00:32:11.850
"All right, I want to talk about
one NP complete problem that's",00:32:18.430,00:32:21.430
really important.,00:32:21.430,00:32:22.560
And that is SAT.,00:32:22.560,00:32:23.550
So SAT means satisfiability.,00:32:27.400,00:32:29.466
"So given the logical
expression, find some values",00:32:36.500,00:32:38.970
"for the variables
that make it true.",00:32:38.970,00:32:42.050
"Let me grab an
example from here.",00:32:42.050,00:32:45.430
"So in SAT your
expressions come out",00:32:45.430,00:32:47.210
"in a really nice form, so
parsing isn't a big deal.",00:32:47.210,00:32:50.910
"The way they come
out is there a bunch",00:32:50.910,00:32:52.530
of terms separated by AND.,00:32:52.530,00:32:54.500
"So your expressions
look like this-- and,",00:32:54.500,00:33:00.860
"and, and-- say we
have four terms.",00:33:00.860,00:33:07.610
These look good.,00:33:07.610,00:33:10.110
"So you have some
terms, say n terms,",00:33:10.110,00:33:15.580
"and they're all
separated by ANDs.",00:33:15.580,00:33:17.410
This is a term.,00:33:17.410,00:33:20.100
"In a term you have
variables separated by ORs.",00:33:20.100,00:33:23.830
Nothing else.,00:33:23.830,00:33:24.560
"Just either the
variable or a variable",00:33:24.560,00:33:27.590
with a NOT in front of it.,00:33:27.590,00:33:29.750
"So say x1 OR NOT x2, NOT x1 OR
x4, NOT x3 or x4, and X2 OR X4.",00:33:29.750,00:33:55.600
"So this is called the
Conjuntive Normal Form, CNF.",00:33:55.600,00:33:59.050
"The reason this is really
nice to work with is-- OK,",00:34:01.756,00:34:05.610
"you just have some
variables here.",00:34:05.610,00:34:08.460
"You know that these
are all joined by AND,",00:34:08.460,00:34:10.690
"so you're going to have to
make all these terms true.",00:34:10.690,00:34:12.900
And then you have ORs inside.,00:34:16.420,00:34:17.830
"So you know that for
every term, at least one",00:34:17.830,00:34:19.940
"of the things inside
the term has to be true.",00:34:19.940,00:34:22.699
And that's it.,00:34:22.699,00:34:25.007
This is the problem.,00:34:25.007,00:34:25.840
This is SAT.,00:34:25.840,00:34:27.810
You have n terms.,00:34:27.810,00:34:29.080
"And then the number of variables
that you have inside is k.",00:34:29.080,00:34:33.790
"So you have at most k
variables in a term.",00:34:33.790,00:34:37.529
"This k looks like
a constant factor.",00:34:42.120,00:34:44.830
"But it's so important
that in fact it",00:34:44.830,00:34:46.510
"shows up in the
name of the problem.",00:34:46.510,00:34:48.020
The problem is called k-SAT.,00:34:51.400,00:34:53.449
"And there are two
values of k for which",00:34:53.449,00:34:57.630
the problem is important.,00:34:57.630,00:34:58.910
"There's 2-SAT,
and there's 3-SAT.",00:34:58.910,00:35:06.030
2-SAT is polynomial.,00:35:06.030,00:35:08.330
"We have a solution that runs
in order and time in fact.",00:35:08.330,00:35:11.460
Really good.,00:35:11.460,00:35:12.060
"AUDIENCE: But you're
saying that to make--",00:35:17.868,00:35:20.288
"you're actually rearranging
things or you're just--",00:35:20.288,00:35:23.240
"PROFESSOR: So I have to come
up with values for x1, x2, x3,",00:35:23.240,00:35:27.090
"and four, so that the
whole thing is true.",00:35:27.090,00:35:30.290
"And the expression
is already arranged",00:35:30.290,00:35:32.130
in this nice form for you.,00:35:32.130,00:35:36.000
"AUDIENCE: It's just--
it seems like order",00:35:36.000,00:35:38.049
"and, because you're just
evaluating to block, right?",00:35:38.049,00:35:40.215
"PROFESSOR: Well, no, you have
to come up with the values.",00:35:40.215,00:35:42.608
"AUDIENCE: Oh, I know.",00:35:42.608,00:35:43.572
I know.,00:35:43.572,00:35:44.072
But like--,00:35:44.072,00:35:44.572
"PROFESSOR: OK and this
seems really easy, right?",00:35:44.572,00:35:46.610
"Well, wait for it.",00:35:46.610,00:35:47.640
Wait for it.,00:35:47.640,00:35:48.830
2-SAT is polynomial.,00:35:48.830,00:35:51.270
3-SAT is NP-complete.,00:35:51.270,00:35:53.230
"So if you solve it, you're
in turn for a Turing reward,",00:35:58.210,00:36:01.730
"or you can become
really, really rich.",00:36:01.730,00:36:05.730
"So n-SAT can be
reduced to 3-SAT.",00:36:05.730,00:36:08.200
"So for anything
bigger than three,",00:36:12.530,00:36:14.450
"n-SAT can be reduced to 3-SAT
using reasonable reduction.",00:36:14.450,00:36:18.950
"So the input size
won't explode too much.",00:36:18.950,00:36:21.930
So why is this important.,00:36:25.280,00:36:27.290
"This basically shows us
that 3-SAT is NP-complete.",00:36:27.290,00:36:30.700
"And I can make a
three-minute proof",00:36:30.700,00:36:34.630
that 3-SAT is NP-complete.,00:36:34.630,00:36:36.260
"Let's take that verifier
guy that we have there.",00:36:38.780,00:36:42.040
"A verifier wants the
input, which already have",00:36:42.040,00:36:44.480
and the proof.,00:36:44.480,00:36:45.950
"Let's write the
verifier as a circuit",00:36:45.950,00:36:49.110
"that takes the input
and the proof as bits.",00:36:49.110,00:36:53.550
Those are input to the circuit.,00:36:53.550,00:36:55.120
"The circuit is going to
evaluate to true or false.",00:36:55.120,00:36:58.370
"Now that we have a circuit,
it's easy to turn that",00:36:58.370,00:37:00.950
into a logical expression.,00:37:00.950,00:37:02.980
"Turn AND gate and OR gate
into-- and ANDs and ORs,",00:37:02.980,00:37:09.420
"and then reduce N-SAT to
3-SAT and get one of these.",00:37:09.420,00:37:12.365
"If you can solve
3-SAT, then you can",00:37:15.240,00:37:18.510
"compute values for
the proof bits.",00:37:18.510,00:37:21.551
Bam.,00:37:21.551,00:37:22.050
That's it.,00:37:22.050,00:37:22.925
"So I take the verifier and
I turn it into a circuit.",00:37:26.440,00:37:33.210
The circuit is all logic gates.,00:37:36.710,00:37:38.750
"And then it has some inputs,
the original problem input",00:37:38.750,00:37:47.770
and the proof.,00:37:47.770,00:37:50.580
"These are represented
as a series of bits,",00:37:50.580,00:37:52.417
"and they're all
inputs in the circuit.",00:37:52.417,00:37:54.000
"If the algorithm
is polynomial time,",00:38:00.300,00:38:03.290
"then the circuit also has to be
polynomial in the input size.",00:38:03.290,00:38:08.760
"Proof already has to be
polynomial in the input size,",00:38:08.760,00:38:11.010
so we're all good.,00:38:11.010,00:38:11.760
We're all in polynomial world.,00:38:11.760,00:38:14.600
"Now we take this
circuit, and we turn it",00:38:14.600,00:38:17.682
into a logical expression.,00:38:17.682,00:38:18.765
"Sorry not logical, logic, also
known as a Boolean expression.",00:38:23.780,00:38:32.360
"So the input bits become
Boolean variables,",00:38:32.360,00:38:34.670
"and then we express gates as
Boolean functions-- AND, OR,",00:38:34.670,00:38:38.370
"NOT, whatever we want.",00:38:38.370,00:38:40.000
"And this is going to
give us some expression.",00:38:40.000,00:38:41.875
"That expression is going to map
to N-SAT for some value of n.",00:38:44.490,00:38:50.210
"So then we're going to
take this expression,",00:38:50.210,00:38:52.280
"and we're going to
reduce it to 3-SAT.",00:38:52.280,00:38:54.160
"So actually we're going to
reduce the expression to 3-CNF",00:38:57.840,00:39:00.610
and then run 3-SAT on it.,00:39:00.610,00:39:02.840
"The expression will
be reduced to 3-CNF.",00:39:02.840,00:39:05.900
"So to something that
looks like this,",00:39:05.900,00:39:07.570
"except you have three
variables inside everything.",00:39:07.570,00:39:11.280
"Once it's in 3-CNF, you
can run 3-SAT on it.",00:39:11.280,00:39:14.310
"If it is satisfiable,
then 3-SAT has",00:39:18.110,00:39:20.340
"to give us some values
here for the variables.",00:39:20.340,00:39:25.640
"Some of the variables are
the problem input-- Sorry",00:39:25.640,00:39:29.370
"the problem input gets
hard coded in the circuit.",00:39:29.370,00:39:31.470
Sorry.,00:39:31.470,00:39:31.969
"Not thinking here--
hard coded in circuit,",00:39:31.969,00:39:39.580
"because we don't want it to
tell us what the input is.",00:39:39.580,00:39:42.560
"And then the proof is
encoded as a series",00:39:42.560,00:39:44.740
"of bits, which are
inputs in the circuit.",00:39:44.740,00:39:48.511
OK.,00:39:48.511,00:39:49.010
"So problem hard coded, proofs
are inputs in the circuit.",00:39:49.010,00:39:53.210
"We've taken the circuits, turned
it into an input for 3-SAT.",00:39:53.210,00:39:56.150
"If 3-SAT says there is a
valid variable assignment,",00:39:56.150,00:40:02.610
"then that assignment tells me
what the bits are in the proof.",00:40:02.610,00:40:05.630
"So that means I can take the
proof, feed it to the verifier.",00:40:08.210,00:40:11.830
"The verifier will
say it's happy,",00:40:11.830,00:40:13.430
so we solved the problem.,00:40:13.430,00:40:15.650
"And this is true for
any NP-complete problem.",00:40:15.650,00:40:18.600
"NP-complete means it has
to have a verifier that",00:40:18.600,00:40:20.810
runs in polynomial time.,00:40:20.810,00:40:22.180
"So I have to be able
to follow this process.",00:40:22.180,00:40:25.070
"So for the factoring
problem, for example, I",00:40:25.070,00:40:26.990
"would take this
modulo algorithm,",00:40:26.990,00:40:30.080
I would express it as a circuit.,00:40:30.080,00:40:32.050
"The bits of P
would be the input.",00:40:32.050,00:40:34.800
"I take that circuit and I turn
into a 3-CNF formula, run it",00:40:34.800,00:40:38.760
on 3-SAT.,00:40:38.760,00:40:40.840
"The variable values for
which the circuit happy",00:40:40.840,00:40:45.050
are the bits of P that make up.,00:40:45.050,00:40:48.150
"So they're the bits of P.
They make up a factor of n.",00:40:48.150,00:40:51.790
"So if I can run 3-SAT fast
enough to get an answer,",00:40:51.790,00:40:54.690
"then I have P and
I have factor of n.",00:40:54.690,00:40:57.960
"And I've become really, really
rich, and bye guys, I'm gone.",00:40:57.960,00:41:01.120
"AUDIENCE: For each
of those expressions,",00:41:05.854,00:41:07.520
"you said you make
that circuit n.",00:41:07.520,00:41:09.620
"You've got all
these inputs, which",00:41:09.620,00:41:11.090
"are x1, x2,
everything like that.",00:41:11.090,00:41:13.730
"Could you just go through
every possible combination?",00:41:13.730,00:41:17.730
"PROFESSOR: That's
exponential, right?",00:41:17.730,00:41:19.790
"That's two to the n, where
n is number of variables.",00:41:19.790,00:41:24.550
"And the number of
variables can be",00:41:24.550,00:41:26.440
"proportional to the
number of terms.",00:41:26.440,00:41:29.016
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:41:29.016,00:41:29.962
That would be fine with it.,00:41:29.962,00:41:31.275
"PROFESSOR: So that
means you have",00:41:31.275,00:41:32.650
an exponential running time.,00:41:32.650,00:41:33.900
"It's not polynomial,
which is reassuring,",00:41:33.900,00:41:36.090
"because otherwise it would mean
that the whole world has been",00:41:36.090,00:41:39.880
"spinning their wheels around
nothing all this time, right?",00:41:39.880,00:41:42.610
"So it's reassuring
that you can't",00:41:42.610,00:41:44.030
"find the solution in two
minutes to this problem.",00:41:44.030,00:41:46.071
"In fact, so far I've been
trying to convince you",00:41:49.580,00:41:51.580
"that you should not
attempt to solve",00:41:51.580,00:41:53.080
"this problem in real
time, so not on exam time,",00:41:53.080,00:41:56.520
"not on [INAUDIBLE] time,
nor anywhere else where time",00:41:56.520,00:41:59.347
actually matters.,00:41:59.347,00:42:00.055
You guys bored?,00:42:04.130,00:42:05.602
Maybe.,00:42:05.602,00:42:06.880
"Well, so there's
this proof that's",00:42:06.880,00:42:09.410
"not too hard to follow that
says that if you solve 3-SAT",00:42:09.410,00:42:12.830
"you have solved any
NP-complete problem by turning",00:42:12.830,00:42:15.180
"the verifier into a
logical expression.",00:42:15.180,00:42:18.380
That's what it comes down to.,00:42:18.380,00:42:20.280
Now 2-SAT is polynomial.,00:42:20.280,00:42:22.062
"And if you guys want, we
can go through the solution.",00:42:22.062,00:42:24.270
"If not, we can skip that.",00:42:24.270,00:42:26.460
"But this tiny difference
here, how many variables",00:42:26.460,00:42:29.530
"you're allowed
inside, which looks",00:42:29.530,00:42:31.290
"like it might be a constant
factor in an algorithm",00:42:31.290,00:42:34.180
"actually makes the difference
between a very easy problem,",00:42:34.180,00:42:38.300
"a problem that's in P, and
the hardest problem in NP.",00:42:38.300,00:42:42.570
"So 2-SAT is order n,
so it's somewhere here.",00:42:42.570,00:42:45.400
3-SAT is all the way here.,00:42:51.960,00:42:53.530
"Small difference how
many variables you're",00:43:02.401,00:43:04.150
"allowed, two or three.",00:43:04.150,00:43:06.417
"Makes all the
difference in the world.",00:43:06.417,00:43:08.000
"AUDIENCE: There are logic
reductions you can make, right?",00:43:14.552,00:43:19.719
"PROFESSOR: There are
optimizations that you",00:43:19.719,00:43:21.510
can make.,00:43:21.510,00:43:22.130

people who do research",00:43:22.130,00:43:24.620
"on how to solve 3-SAT in
a reasonably fast time.",00:43:24.620,00:43:28.820

3-SAT, any problem",00:43:28.820,00:43:30.580
can be reduced to 3-SAT.,00:43:30.580,00:43:34.990

that we're not going to be able",00:43:34.990,00:43:37.770
"to solve this in
polynomial time,",00:43:37.770,00:43:39.360
"because a lot of people tried,
but some researchers are hoping",00:43:39.360,00:43:42.560
"that well maybe you can solve
3-SAT in order of 2 to the n",00:43:42.560,00:43:46.910
"to the power of 0.00001,
which exponential, right?",00:43:46.910,00:43:53.330
"But you can solve many
problems with this.",00:43:53.330,00:43:58.620
"Active research, so far I don't
think they've come very far.",00:43:58.620,00:44:03.114
"Actually, I shouldn't
say that, because if you",00:44:03.114,00:44:05.030
"apply the brute
force algorithm, then",00:44:05.030,00:44:06.571
you die at about 20 variables.,00:44:06.571,00:44:10.400
"State of the art 3-SAT
solving algorithms,",00:44:10.400,00:44:13.790
"I think it can handle
1,000 to 10,000 variables",00:44:13.790,00:44:16.920
"in a reasonable time,
like a few hours.",00:44:16.920,00:44:20.360
There progress.,00:44:20.360,00:44:22.261
"And that is all by doing the
reductions that you said.",00:44:22.261,00:44:24.510
"You see some optimizations that
you can make in the expression.",00:44:24.510,00:44:27.780
"You draw some
inferences, and you",00:44:27.780,00:44:30.410
"explore the possible
configurations,",00:44:30.410,00:44:32.350
taking us part way.,00:44:32.350,00:44:34.480
"So there's a lot of active
research going in that area",00:44:34.480,00:44:36.730
too.,00:44:36.730,00:44:37.640
"So far, they didn't get here.",00:44:37.640,00:44:42.536
"AUDIENCE: That's almost solving
NP-complete problem then,",00:44:42.536,00:44:46.350
right?,00:44:46.350,00:44:46.850
"PROFESSOR: Well,
yeah, the thing is",00:44:46.850,00:44:48.690
"in the end we care about
practical solutions, right?",00:44:48.690,00:44:52.000
"So they're hoping to get
to a practical solution.",00:44:52.000,00:44:54.260
"AUDIENCE: Well, a few
hours is pretty practical.",00:44:54.260,00:44:56.259
So that's for some problems.,00:44:58.850,00:45:01.490
"Obviously they didn't
solve factoring, right?",00:45:01.490,00:45:04.250
"If they would have solved
1,000-bit factoring in a few",00:45:04.250,00:45:07.070
"hours, then we
would have noticed.",00:45:07.070,00:45:09.120
AUDIENCE: Maybe.,00:45:12.000,00:45:13.920
"Seriously, OK.",00:45:13.920,00:45:15.095
"PROFESSOR: We
would have noticed.",00:45:15.095,00:45:16.470
So far so good?,00:45:21.010,00:45:21.660
Any questions on this stuff?,00:45:21.660,00:45:22.826
"So I want to reemphasize in
two minutes, the reduction",00:45:25.330,00:45:29.110
part of this.,00:45:29.110,00:45:29.820
"So the reason why we
can solve, once we solve",00:45:29.820,00:45:32.810
"one NP-complete problem,
we solve all the other ones",00:45:32.810,00:45:35.270
is reductions.,00:45:35.270,00:45:36.333
"So we've done a lot of graph
transformations in this class.",00:45:39.640,00:45:42.390
"We had three recitations and two
or three exam problems on that,",00:45:42.390,00:45:45.970
"and I think we had some
homework problems on it",00:45:45.970,00:45:48.170
"too-- a lot of graph
transformations.",00:45:48.170,00:45:50.450
"Graph transformations
are just reductions.",00:45:50.450,00:45:52.260
"You take some problem that looks
hard, and you do some magic,",00:45:52.260,00:45:56.790
"and you build a graph that
represents that problem,",00:45:56.790,00:45:59.290
and you run shortest path on it.,00:45:59.290,00:46:01.520
"Then you take the output for
the shortest path algorithm,",00:46:01.520,00:46:04.330
"and you turn it into a solution
to the initial problem.",00:46:04.330,00:46:07.487
"This means that we've
reduced those problems",00:46:07.487,00:46:09.320
to shortest path.,00:46:09.320,00:46:12.440
"Well, you don't have to
reduce to shortest path.",00:46:12.440,00:46:14.440
"If you have a problem that
you know how to solve,",00:46:14.440,00:46:16.481
"you can take any other
problem and reduce to it,",00:46:16.481,00:46:18.990
"and you've solved
that other problem.",00:46:18.990,00:46:21.120
"So basically, here, if you
have your starting problem,",00:46:21.120,00:46:24.960
"shortest path is
just one smiley face.",00:46:24.960,00:46:26.890
"As long as you arrive
to any smiley face,",00:46:26.890,00:46:28.680
you're in good shape.,00:46:28.680,00:46:32.018
"Of course, you
have to be careful",00:46:32.018,00:46:33.720
"that while you're
doing you're reduction,",00:46:33.720,00:46:35.428
"your problem size
doesn't explode.",00:46:35.428,00:46:38.110
"So for example, if you take this
problem-- if you take 3-SAT--",00:46:38.110,00:46:45.420
"if you take a 3-CNF
expression, and you reduce it",00:46:45.420,00:46:49.290
"to the graph that has
3 to the n vertices,",00:46:49.290,00:46:51.471
"and then you try to
run [INAUDIBLE] on it,",00:46:51.471,00:46:53.220
"it was the running
time, 3 to the n.",00:46:53.220,00:46:55.200
"Now I've got a new
polynomial, right?",00:46:55.200,00:46:57.144
"So when you do the
reductions, you",00:46:57.144,00:46:58.560
"have to be careful about what
happens to your input size.",00:46:58.560,00:47:03.020
And that's about it.,00:47:03.020,00:47:04.930
This is complexity theory.,00:47:04.930,00:47:08.024
"It's basically one
big excuse for why",00:47:08.024,00:47:10.300
"we can't solve some
problems that are hard.",00:47:10.300,00:47:13.340
