guys might have heard,",00:00:20.794,00:00:22.460
we have a quiz tomorrow.,00:00:22.460,00:00:24.590
"So we're going to do
a review for that.",00:00:24.590,00:00:26.880
Did everyone turn in P set six?,00:00:26.880,00:00:29.690
Yes?,00:00:29.690,00:00:30.200
Good.,00:00:30.200,00:00:30.900
"All right, so
what's on this quiz?",00:00:30.900,00:00:34.060
Numerics and graph stuff.,00:00:34.060,00:00:37.470
"So are there any
specific pain points?",00:00:37.470,00:00:39.920

placed before the quiz.,00:00:50.580,00:00:51.700
Poor guy.,00:00:51.700,00:00:52.360
So take advantage of that.,00:00:52.360,00:00:55.230
So yeah.,00:00:55.230,00:00:56.085
"AUDIENCE: Numerics, on
P set we were mostly",00:00:56.085,00:00:59.460
"asked-- you said five,
four, whichever came before.",00:00:59.460,00:01:02.140
"You mostly asked for the running
times and things like that.",00:01:02.140,00:01:05.140
"But the numeric lecture
notes are kind of detailed",00:01:05.140,00:01:08.570
"and go into Newtonian
method and all that.",00:01:08.570,00:01:13.320
"How much detail do
we need to know?",00:01:13.320,00:01:15.750
"PROFESSOR: So on the P set
we make your life easier",00:01:15.750,00:01:18.130
"by giving you the
pseudocode of the code",00:01:18.130,00:01:20.800
that you needed to implement.,00:01:20.800,00:01:23.040

algorithm design question,",00:01:23.040,00:01:26.380
"the problem of
finding the k-th root.",00:01:26.380,00:01:28.620
"And that required
you to understand",00:01:28.620,00:01:30.820
"almost everything
that was going on.",00:01:30.820,00:01:32.760

things that are going on",00:01:32.760,00:01:35.410
"to come up with something fairly
similar to what you've seen.",00:01:35.410,00:01:39.951
"So yeah, I know
that I told you guys",00:01:39.951,00:01:41.450
before that ignore numerics.,00:01:41.450,00:01:42.777
"Just close your eyes and
pretend it didn't happen.",00:01:42.777,00:01:44.860
"Actually it turns out there's a
significant amount of numerics",00:01:44.860,00:01:47.950
on the quiz.,00:01:47.950,00:01:48.450
"So we're going to start
with a numerics problem,",00:01:48.450,00:01:50.450
and go through it.,00:01:50.450,00:01:51.770
I'm really sorry about that.,00:01:51.770,00:01:53.500
"Clearly I didn't have
my way for this, right?",00:01:53.500,00:01:55.850
"OK so we started two
big things in numerics.",00:01:55.850,00:02:00.090
"Karatsuba, which is
really easy compared",00:02:00.090,00:02:02.470
"to Newton which requires
a lot of understanding.",00:02:02.470,00:02:07.230
"So we're going to spend
our time on Newton today.",00:02:07.230,00:02:11.200
"OK, so anything aside from that?",00:02:11.200,00:02:12.990
Yes.,00:02:12.990,00:02:13.813
"AUDIENCE: The thing we
were just talking about",00:02:13.813,00:02:15.729

was what kind of edges",00:02:15.729,00:02:17.757
"are produced by depth
first search versus breadth",00:02:17.757,00:02:21.160
first search?,00:02:21.160,00:02:21.701

do they matter?",00:02:21.701,00:02:23.334
"PROFESSOR: And why
do they matter.",00:02:23.334,00:02:24.750
OK.,00:02:24.750,00:02:24.950
"AUDIENCE: Because it's probably
going to be a question on the--",00:02:24.950,00:02:26.010
"PROFESSOR: So I'm going to
go on this very quickly now,",00:02:26.010,00:02:28.830
"because I want to
cover problems,",00:02:28.830,00:02:30.290

the outline for the review.",00:02:30.290,00:02:33.941
"So if you guys can
make it tonight--",00:02:33.941,00:02:35.440
"AUDIENCE: It's late,
so I can't make it.",00:02:35.440,00:02:37.106
PROFESSOR: Sorry.,00:02:37.106,00:02:38.212
"Well, they are also
in the lecture notes.",00:02:38.212,00:02:39.920
"But I'll go through
them very quickly now.",00:02:39.920,00:02:42.110
"OK, anything else?",00:02:42.110,00:02:43.040
"AUDIENCE: Making trees
with DFS and BFS,",00:02:47.780,00:02:49.450
this might be tonight also.,00:02:49.450,00:02:51.049
PROFESSOR: Making trees--,00:02:51.049,00:02:52.090
AUDIENCE: Or your search trees.,00:02:52.090,00:02:54.050
"So instead of-- do you
know what I mean by that?",00:02:54.050,00:02:58.700
"PROFESSOR: Do you mean
graph transformation?",00:02:58.700,00:03:01.255
"AUDIENCE: So you've got a tree
and you search through it.",00:03:01.255,00:03:03.630
"So then when you're
searching through it,",00:03:03.630,00:03:05.627
"the result of searching
it, you can put that",00:03:05.627,00:03:07.460
into almost a binary tree.,00:03:07.460,00:03:11.100
"PROFESSOR: OK so
how BFS and DFS work",00:03:11.100,00:03:12.980
"and how they produce
trees, I'm assuming, right?",00:03:12.980,00:03:15.480
"Because if you start
out with a tree,",00:03:15.480,00:03:17.040
"everything's going to be
really nice and simple.",00:03:17.040,00:03:19.980
AUDIENCE: Right.,00:03:19.980,00:03:21.410
PROFESSOR: Yes?,00:03:21.410,00:03:22.360
AUDIENCE: Bidirectional search.,00:03:22.360,00:03:23.797
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:03:23.797,00:03:24.380
"AUDIENCE: Is that
going to be included?",00:03:24.380,00:03:25.960
"PROFESSOR: At a very
conceptual level",00:03:25.960,00:03:27.501
"because we didn't give
you a P set on it.",00:03:27.501,00:03:31.460
"AUDIENCE: Was that
what rubrics was?",00:03:31.460,00:03:33.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:03:33.140,00:03:34.160
AUDIENCE: It was bidirectional?,00:03:34.160,00:03:34.810
"AUDIENCE: Well it's not going
to be on it so, we're happy.",00:03:34.810,00:03:36.250
"PROFESSOR: Well I mean
we didn't give you--",00:03:36.250,00:03:38.041
"you kind of had to solve a
problem just by-- we have",00:03:38.041,00:03:40.910
"to tell you this
is bidirectional",00:03:40.910,00:03:42.950
"BFS, go code it up.",00:03:42.950,00:03:44.850
"This is bi-directional
Dijkstra, go code it up.",00:03:44.850,00:03:47.250
"So we're not going to ask you
anything too fancy on them.",00:03:47.250,00:03:51.110
So nothing past the P set.,00:03:51.110,00:03:53.204
"AUDIENCE: Will you
have a question",00:03:53.204,00:03:54.620
"like when you were
studying BFS, saying",00:03:54.620,00:03:57.050
"how there will be
levels of graphs?",00:03:57.050,00:04:00.313
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:04:00.313,00:04:00.938
"AUDIENCE: Could there
be anything about that?",00:04:00.938,00:04:02.890
"PROFESSOR: So levels of graphs
as in the levels in BFS?",00:04:02.890,00:04:05.420
"Or the levels that we're using
when we're building graphs?",00:04:05.420,00:04:08.227
"AUDIENCE: Copies of
graphs and then--",00:04:08.227,00:04:09.768
AUDIENCE: Transformations.,00:04:09.768,00:04:10.210
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:04:10.210,00:04:10.570
"OK, transformations and layers.",00:04:10.570,00:04:11.980
"Yeah, I think this is important.",00:04:11.980,00:04:13.447
"AUDIENCE: Any particular tips
on what kind of transformations",00:04:13.447,00:04:15.988
we might encounter?,00:04:15.988,00:04:17.014
PROFESSOR: Sure.,00:04:17.014,00:04:17.680
"Problem one has this
transformation, problem two--",00:04:17.680,00:04:19.882
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER],00:04:19.882,00:04:20.866
"AUDIENCE: Basically,
when do we use these?",00:04:20.866,00:04:24.690
"Is it when we are given more
than one parameter for a cause.",00:04:24.690,00:04:29.440
"PROFESSOR: So I have
some problems on this",00:04:29.440,00:04:31.396
but we have to have a deal.,00:04:31.396,00:04:32.520
"You guys have to help me
go through the problems",00:04:32.520,00:04:34.560
fast enough so that we get here.,00:04:34.560,00:04:36.680
OK?,00:04:36.680,00:04:37.180
"So if you know the
answer, say the answer.",00:04:37.180,00:04:39.830
Don't let me wait.,00:04:39.830,00:04:42.910
OK.,00:04:42.910,00:04:43.665
"AUDIENCE: Also, when you run
Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford",00:04:43.665,00:04:46.660
"on a graph, with
positive edges, they",00:04:46.660,00:04:50.340
"produce the same
shortest path weight",00:04:50.340,00:04:52.970
but might have different trees?,00:04:52.970,00:04:55.570
"PROFESSOR: Yes,
that's conceivable.",00:04:55.570,00:04:57.837
Because they--,00:04:57.837,00:04:58.420
"AUDIENCE: It's one of the
questions on spring 2011.",00:04:58.420,00:05:00.650
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:05:00.650,00:05:01.233
"So first off, they both
have positive edges, so",00:05:01.233,00:05:04.420
"they both work, right?",00:05:04.420,00:05:06.170
"If you had to choose,
which one would you choose?",00:05:06.170,00:05:09.247
"If you had to choose
which are going to run,",00:05:09.247,00:05:11.080
which one would you run?,00:05:11.080,00:05:11.750
AUDIENCE: Dijkstra.,00:05:11.750,00:05:12.541
"PROFESSOR: OK, why Dijkstra?",00:05:12.541,00:05:13.735
AUDIENCE: It's faster.,00:05:13.735,00:05:15.070
PROFESSOR: Faster.,00:05:15.070,00:05:15.960
"OK so positive edges,
Dijkstra is faster.",00:05:15.960,00:05:27.464
"Now if you're going
to run both of them,",00:05:27.464,00:05:29.130
"they relax edges in
different orders.",00:05:29.130,00:05:31.470
Right?,00:05:31.470,00:05:31.970
So let's say we have this.,00:05:31.970,00:05:34.310
"I know you guys remember the
sequence of diamonds, right?",00:05:36.950,00:05:40.560
"My nice example that shows that
the number of paths in a graph",00:05:40.560,00:05:43.710
"is exponential in the
number of vertices.",00:05:43.710,00:05:46.080
So let's have one diamond.,00:05:46.080,00:05:47.376
"1, 1, 1, 1.",00:05:47.376,00:05:50.490
"S, A, B, T. So say we're
looking for shortest path",00:05:50.490,00:05:57.490
from S. Right?,00:05:57.490,00:05:58.550
"So the distance
from S to S is zero,",00:05:58.550,00:06:02.660
"and everything else
starts out as infinity.",00:06:02.660,00:06:05.730
SA is infinity.,00:06:05.730,00:06:07.270
SB is infinity.,00:06:07.270,00:06:10.150
ST is infinity.,00:06:10.150,00:06:12.630
"Suppose I relax
edges in this order.",00:06:12.630,00:06:14.650
"One, two, three, four.",00:06:14.650,00:06:18.150
What am I going to get?,00:06:18.150,00:06:19.190
"If I relax SA, then the
distance from S to A",00:06:19.190,00:06:22.540
"is going to become 1, right?",00:06:22.540,00:06:23.730
Because it's 0 plus 1 1.,00:06:23.730,00:06:27.090
"And then the parent
of A is going to be S.",00:06:27.090,00:06:30.610
Now say I relax AT.,00:06:30.610,00:06:34.300
"The distance from S
to T is going to be 2.",00:06:34.300,00:06:38.440
Sorry.,00:06:38.440,00:06:39.640
"Parent of T is going
to be A. Right?",00:06:39.640,00:06:46.020
OK now I'm relaxing this one.,00:06:46.020,00:06:50.080
"This is going to become
one and the parent of B",00:06:50.080,00:06:53.400
"is going to become S. And
as I'm relaxing this one,",00:06:53.400,00:06:56.820
"nothing happens because I
already had a distance of 2.",00:06:56.820,00:07:00.460
"Now if I relax them
in this order instead,",00:07:00.460,00:07:03.010
"so the bottom one first and
the top one is afterwards,",00:07:03.010,00:07:07.210
"I'm going to get
the different path.",00:07:07.210,00:07:09.220
Right?,00:07:09.220,00:07:09.760
"OK so what path do I
have now from S to T?",00:07:09.760,00:07:11.850
"AUDIENCE: Right
now you have SAT.",00:07:15.440,00:07:16.900
"PROFESSOR: OK, why SAT?",00:07:16.900,00:07:19.250
How do you compute the path?,00:07:19.250,00:07:20.520
"Parent pointers, right?",00:07:20.520,00:07:21.910
"Start at T, look at
the parent pointer.",00:07:21.910,00:07:25.820
Look at the parent pointer.,00:07:25.820,00:07:26.980
"So because I relax
them in this order,",00:07:29.940,00:07:32.550
"this path was considered
before this path.",00:07:32.550,00:07:35.260
"So the parent pointer of
T is A but if I relax them",00:07:35.260,00:07:37.820
"in the other order, the
parent pointer could be B.",00:07:37.820,00:07:40.542
"So by the way, this
could happen if you're",00:07:40.542,00:07:42.420
"running Dijkstra
or Bellman-Ford.",00:07:42.420,00:07:44.102
"Or if you're running
Dijkstra, it's",00:07:44.102,00:07:45.560
"just about how you're going
to have the ties separated.",00:07:45.560,00:07:48.610
"So your priority
queue implementation",00:07:48.610,00:07:50.320
might give you different paths.,00:07:50.320,00:07:52.346
Does it make sense now?,00:07:52.346,00:07:53.840
"So if the order in
which edges are relaxed.",00:07:53.840,00:07:55.730
"That's what defines with path
you're going to end up with.",00:07:55.730,00:07:58.453
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:07:58.453,00:07:59.140
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:07:59.140,00:08:00.050
Hopefully useful.,00:08:00.050,00:08:02.480
All right.,00:08:02.480,00:08:04.560
I saw four hands before.,00:08:04.560,00:08:06.485
"AUDIENCE: Oh, just
overall, how similar",00:08:06.485,00:08:08.720
"is this test compared
to previous tests?",00:08:08.720,00:08:11.370
"PROFESSOR: Less algorithm
design, more concepts.",00:08:11.370,00:08:15.070
AUDIENCE: Nice.,00:08:15.070,00:08:15.695
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:08:15.695,00:08:17.120
"PROFESSOR: Well OK,
not less algorithm--",00:08:17.120,00:08:19.660

using this one",00:12:38.994,00:12:40.410

requires that you compute this.,00:12:55.420,00:12:57.860

root of 6 over 6.",00:13:05.650,00:13:07.920

is a good function.",00:13:08.657,00:13:10.240

"So lets see, if we try
to compute it using this,",00:13:16.830,00:13:18.950
what do we get?,00:13:18.950,00:13:21.215
xi minus,00:13:21.215,00:13:23.125
"AUDIENCE: x cubed minus 6,006.",00:13:23.125,00:13:25.544

"PROFESSOR: I'll
choose the easy step.",00:13:49.515,00:13:51.056
OK.,00:13:53.998,00:13:54.498
So what's x1?,00:14:01.970,00:14:02.845
AUDIENCE: You plug in x0.,00:14:10.030,00:14:12.510

it's very close.",00:14:16.785,00:14:19.160

"So 0.67, let's
get to that later.",00:14:24.310,00:14:28.230
I don't like fractional numbers.,00:14:28.230,00:14:31.210

right answer math-wise,",00:14:31.210,00:14:32.960

"we probably don't want
fractional numbers.",00:14:35.430,00:14:37.180
So very good point there.,00:14:37.180,00:14:38.730
What if I want to compute x2?,00:14:38.730,00:14:40.940

I plug it into where?",00:14:40.940,00:14:43.350
"This thing over here, right?",00:14:47.020,00:14:49.730

compute approximations",00:14:49.730,00:14:51.750
"that get closer and closer
to my original value.",00:14:51.750,00:14:56.240

would you even ask?",00:15:19.900,00:15:21.370

half would be a nice guess.",00:15:25.020,00:15:29.000

this up, by the way.",00:18:33.130,00:18:35.020
"Well, not me but suppose
we want to code this up.",00:18:35.020,00:18:37.061
"What's the first
thing we want to do?",00:18:37.061,00:18:39.156
"AUDIENCE: I think we want an
initial guess at a function.",00:18:39.156,00:18:42.000
"PROFESSOR: OK so we're going
to need an initial guess.",00:18:42.000,00:18:44.250
That's good.,00:18:44.250,00:18:44.930
And what else do we want?,00:18:49.770,00:18:52.259
"AUDIENCE: We need to decide
how much precision we want.",00:18:52.259,00:18:54.550
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:18:54.550,00:18:55.175
And why is that?,00:18:55.175,00:18:56.335
"AUDIENCE: Because this
cube root of 2 is 1.",00:18:56.335,00:18:59.245
If you round down.,00:18:59.245,00:19:01.670
That doesn't tell us very much.,00:19:01.670,00:19:04.580
"I don't know, we don't
like the fractions.",00:19:04.580,00:19:07.022
"PROFESSOR: We don't
like fractions.",00:19:07.022,00:19:08.480
"OK, why don't we like fractions?",00:19:08.480,00:19:10.670
It's a lot easier to code.,00:19:10.670,00:19:11.835
AUDIENCE: Decimal point there.,00:19:11.835,00:19:12.990
"PROFESSOR: Yep, you have to
deal with the decimal point",00:19:12.990,00:19:14.640
and we don't like that.,00:19:14.640,00:19:15.598
"So we want to take
this problem, and we",00:19:15.598,00:19:17.912
"want to move it
into integer land.",00:19:17.912,00:19:20.000
"So what we did
here has fractions.",00:19:20.000,00:19:21.750
"We don't like that because
that's a pain to code.",00:19:21.750,00:19:23.980
"We didn't make you code
fractions on the P set, right?",00:19:23.980,00:19:26.780
"So then we better know
how to avoid fractions",00:19:26.780,00:19:29.190
"if you want to solve
real life problems.",00:19:29.190,00:19:32.670
"So we're going to say that
we're happy with some amount",00:19:32.670,00:19:36.310
of precision in the answer.,00:19:36.310,00:19:38.110
"And then we're going
to do something",00:19:38.110,00:19:39.920
"that lets us do all our
computations in integer land.",00:19:39.920,00:19:42.676
Because that's a happy place.,00:19:49.340,00:19:51.720
"So how do I-- suppose
I'm working in base B",00:19:51.720,00:20:00.020
"and I want d digits
of precision.",00:20:00.020,00:20:03.720
What do I want to compute?,00:20:03.720,00:20:06.300
"How do I transform the
problem in that way?",00:20:06.300,00:20:08.806
Yes?,00:20:08.806,00:20:09.660
"AUDIENCE: You multiply 2
root 3 times B to the d.",00:20:09.660,00:20:15.262
"PROFESSOR: OK so
we want the answer",00:20:15.262,00:20:16.720
to be 2 times B to the d.,00:20:16.720,00:20:22.146
"And if we're integer land, what
are we actually going to get?",00:20:22.146,00:20:24.790
"So suppose B is 10-- let's work
with familiar numbers-- d is 2.",00:20:30.830,00:20:37.210
"So we're going to
want to compute",00:20:37.210,00:20:40.950
square root of 3 2 times 100.,00:20:40.950,00:20:45.005
"Does anyone have a
calculator and can tell me",00:20:45.005,00:20:46.880
what square root of 3 is?,00:20:46.880,00:20:49.390
First two digits?,00:20:49.390,00:20:50.279
AUDIENCE: Cube root of 2.,00:20:50.279,00:20:51.320
"PROFESSOR: Sorry,
cube root of 2.",00:20:51.320,00:20:52.695
AUDIENCE: 1.2.,00:20:57.720,00:20:59.985
"PROFESSOR: So let's say that
square root of 3 is 1.2345.",00:20:59.985,00:21:06.770
"Hopefully someone will
fix this up for us.",00:21:06.770,00:21:08.780
But let's say it's this.,00:21:08.780,00:21:10.020
"If I multiply it by
100 what do I get?",00:21:10.020,00:21:13.310
123 times 45.,00:21:13.310,00:21:14.750
"So multiply by 100 means
you move the decimal point",00:21:18.780,00:21:21.860
to the right.,00:21:21.860,00:21:22.640
Right?,00:21:22.640,00:21:23.140
So it's still not an integer.,00:21:23.140,00:21:24.820
"If we work in integer
land, our algorithm",00:21:24.820,00:21:27.010
will return an integer.,00:21:27.010,00:21:29.450
"What's the integer
that we're hoping",00:21:29.450,00:21:30.950
our algorithm will return?,00:21:30.950,00:21:33.464

"PROFESSOR: We're
hoping so, right?",00:21:35.260,00:21:37.090
Why?,00:21:37.090,00:21:37.590
What can you do with 123?,00:21:37.590,00:21:38.730
Shift right.,00:21:41.950,00:21:42.520
"So if you divide this
by 100, you get 1.23.",00:21:42.520,00:21:47.060
"And this is our answer with
two digits of precision.",00:21:47.060,00:21:49.895

the actual-- it's 1.2599.",00:21:49.895,00:21:56.582

OK.,00:22:04.800,00:22:07.460
"So our algorithm will
give us this, right?",00:22:07.460,00:22:11.320
"So it's not going to
give us exactly cube",00:22:11.320,00:22:16.530

"It's not going to give
us exactly this value.",00:22:18.690,00:22:20.630

close to that.",00:22:23.424,00:22:24.965
"PROFESSOR: So it's going to
give us an integer, right?",00:22:29.720,00:22:32.830

"that says that even though
you're taking floors",00:22:52.310,00:22:54.268
"all the time, it will still
converge to the right thing.",00:22:54.268,00:22:58.430
"So in order to compute
this, how are we",00:22:58.430,00:23:01.739
going to transform the problem?,00:23:01.739,00:23:03.030
"AUDIENCE: Slide

"to compute cube root
of 2 times B to the 3d.",00:23:14.150,00:23:18.466
Fair enough?,00:23:25.580,00:23:26.630

the binary search.",00:26:20.450,00:26:21.950
Binary search from 0 to r.,00:26:21.950,00:26:26.630

g cubed compared to r.",00:26:41.870,00:26:49.440

Make sense for everyone?,00:27:00.120,00:27:01.120
"Sorry, r.",00:27:04.460,00:27:07.060
My bad.,00:27:07.060,00:27:07.560

digit in base, B, so hopefully",00:27:11.700,00:27:14.800
not too much work.,00:27:14.800,00:27:17.740
OK.,00:27:17.740,00:27:18.720
"But remember this, you can;t
do the comparison directly",00:27:18.720,00:27:21.234
"because you can't
compute this directly.",00:27:21.234,00:27:22.900
So you need to do it this way.,00:27:22.900,00:27:26.730
"AUDIENCE: So r is just the
first digit of the number?",00:27:26.730,00:27:30.197

there's no point right now.",00:27:44.360,00:27:46.810

Right?,00:27:56.620,00:27:57.120
"So I compute x0, x1, x2,
x3, so on and so forth.",00:27:57.120,00:28:02.300

That's what you're?,00:28:15.120,00:28:15.990
Right.,00:28:15.990,00:28:16.490

digits in my approximation--",00:28:49.185,00:28:59.100
"the number of correct
digits-- doubles every time.",00:28:59.100,00:29:02.690
"So after log these steps,
I have the right answer.",00:29:02.690,00:29:05.600
"Now what if instead of doing
this I did binary search?",00:29:05.600,00:29:09.420
"So instead of doing Newton's
method I do binary search on 0",00:29:09.420,00:29:14.640
to r?,00:29:14.640,00:29:15.866
"I can do that, right?",00:29:15.866,00:29:16.740
"Because I can get
a guess and then",00:29:16.740,00:29:19.040
"I can use this to see if
my guess is right or wrong.",00:29:19.040,00:29:24.117
"So in theory I could
do it in binary search.",00:29:24.117,00:29:25.950
How fast would that be?,00:29:25.950,00:29:27.100
"AUDIENCE: And what
is the difference",00:29:27.100,00:29:28.600
between big r and little r?,00:29:28.600,00:29:29.724
"PROFESSOR: Big R is-- oh,
I didn't write the big r.",00:29:32.350,00:29:34.895
"Big r is this guy, here.",00:29:34.895,00:29:35.896
"AUDIENCE: Oh, OK, gotcha.",00:29:35.896,00:29:36.936
OK.,00:29:36.936,00:29:37.830
PROFESSOR: And this is little r.,00:29:37.830,00:29:39.220
Sorry.,00:29:39.220,00:29:39.880
"Good question, I
apologize for that.",00:29:39.880,00:29:42.550
"So R is little r
times B to the 3d.",00:29:42.550,00:29:47.960
AUDIENCE: D times log 2 of B--,00:29:47.960,00:29:51.400
AUDIENCE: To the d.,00:29:51.400,00:29:52.400
Log r to the d.,00:29:52.400,00:29:53.164
"AUDIENCE: Oh, it's
the same thing.",00:29:53.164,00:29:54.580
Right.,00:29:54.580,00:29:55.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:29:55.540,00:29:58.400
On the y.,00:29:58.400,00:29:58.900
"PROFESSOR: OK so the
number of guesses is",00:30:02.760,00:30:09.110
AUDIENCE: Log big r.,00:30:09.110,00:30:10.410
PROFESSOR: Log big r.,00:30:10.410,00:30:12.440
"And someone was one step ahead
and said it's order of B times",00:30:12.440,00:30:19.170
log little r.,00:30:19.170,00:30:21.710
Or I think it's d plus little r.,00:30:21.710,00:30:25.300
So this is order of d.,00:30:25.300,00:30:30.590
"Does this make
sense for everyone?",00:30:30.590,00:30:32.928
"AUDIENCE: I didn't quite
follow what happened there.",00:30:32.928,00:30:36.704
"PROFESSOR: So I'm doing a
binary search on the range",00:30:36.704,00:30:38.870
from 0 to r.,00:30:38.870,00:30:40.540
How many steps?,00:30:40.540,00:30:41.240
How many guesses?,00:30:41.240,00:30:43.018
Log r.,00:30:43.018,00:30:43.946
Right?,00:30:43.946,00:30:44.470
This is binary search.,00:30:44.470,00:30:47.750
R is little r times b to the 3d.,00:30:47.750,00:30:53.620
"So if we log this,
log R is log little r",00:30:53.620,00:31:00.420
"plus 3d log B. B is order
one, so we get order of log B.",00:31:00.420,00:31:10.760
"OK so Newton's method
is exponentially faster",00:31:10.760,00:31:14.300
"in terms of the number of digits
compared to binary search.",00:31:14.300,00:31:17.920
"So if you can pull it
off with Newton's method",00:31:17.920,00:31:20.630
"and you have big
numbers, you probably",00:31:20.630,00:31:22.370
want to use Newton's method.,00:31:22.370,00:31:24.299
"Because binary search will
give you a slower algorithm.",00:31:24.299,00:31:26.590
"OK, how are we doing
with these concepts?",00:31:30.238,00:31:32.420
I see everyone's unhappy.,00:31:37.480,00:31:39.530
"Is it because of Newton
or something I said?",00:31:39.530,00:31:41.430
"AUDIENCE: Can you
summarize the difference",00:31:41.430,00:31:43.770
"between binary search
and Newton's, again?",00:31:43.770,00:31:45.520
"So you said binary
search takes kind",00:31:45.520,00:31:47.930
of long versus Newton's method.,00:31:47.930,00:31:50.060
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:31:50.060,00:31:50.790
So how do you do binary search?,00:31:50.790,00:31:53.391
"AUDIENCE: Divide and
conquer, which is--",00:31:53.391,00:31:55.140
"PROFESSOR: Divide
and conquer, right?",00:31:55.140,00:31:56.681
"You start out with an interval,
you guess somewhere in half,",00:31:56.681,00:31:59.459
"and then you see which half of
the interval you recurse onto.",00:31:59.459,00:32:02.000
"And your interval halves
in size every time.",00:32:02.000,00:32:05.040
"So given the initial size of the
interval, the number of guesses",00:32:05.040,00:32:08.700
"you have is log of
that interval size.",00:32:08.700,00:32:12.350
"In this case we're guessing
a number between 0 and r.",00:32:12.350,00:32:16.410
"So the big goal is to
compute cube root of R.",00:32:16.410,00:32:18.975
"And we're guessing that
hey, it has to be somewhere",00:32:18.975,00:32:21.100
"between 0 and R. So we're going
to do binary search on this.",00:32:21.100,00:32:25.250
"And in order to see
how our guess compares,",00:32:25.250,00:32:28.340
"we're going to use
this trick, here.",00:32:28.340,00:32:31.031
"So the number of guesses
we make is log R. Now",00:32:33.740,00:32:37.640
"R is that number, over there.",00:32:37.640,00:32:39.900
It's little r times B to the 3d.,00:32:39.900,00:32:43.070
So how many digits does it have?,00:32:43.070,00:32:44.520
Roughly d digits.,00:32:44.520,00:32:47.530
"So log of R is
going to be order d.",00:32:47.530,00:32:50.390
"OK so if you do binary search
to guess a d digit number,",00:32:53.650,00:32:57.600
"the running time will
be roughly order d.",00:32:57.600,00:32:59.780
Order of the number of digits.,00:32:59.780,00:33:02.200
"If you use Newton's
method and your function",00:33:02.200,00:33:05.150
"is good and
everything converges,",00:33:05.150,00:33:06.600
"then you have
quadratic convergence.",00:33:06.600,00:33:08.400
"Which guarantees that you'll
have log of d guesses.",00:33:08.400,00:33:11.840
Log of d approximations.,00:33:11.840,00:33:14.080
"So Newton's method is a
lot faster for big numbers,",00:33:14.080,00:33:16.780
"because you have a log
there instead of d.",00:33:16.780,00:33:20.450
"So this is the big
difference between them.",00:33:20.450,00:33:22.810
"But for Newton, you
need a lot of things.",00:33:22.810,00:33:24.680
Right?,00:33:24.680,00:33:24.870
"You need that function,
you need an initial guess,",00:33:24.870,00:33:26.953
"you need a lot of
things to make it work.",00:33:26.953,00:33:29.900
Yes?,00:33:29.900,00:33:30.400
"AUDIENCE: So is that just like
the number of times it runs?",00:33:30.400,00:33:32.858
"Because don't you have a
multiplication and a division?",00:33:32.858,00:33:35.985
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:33:35.985,00:33:36.610
"So this is the
number of guesses.",00:33:36.610,00:33:38.830
"The total running time
is quite different.",00:33:38.830,00:33:40.720
"You need to jump through a few
more hoops to analyze that.",00:33:40.720,00:33:43.136
"But this is the number of
guesses or approximations",00:33:43.136,00:33:48.280
that each method makes.,00:33:48.280,00:33:51.362
"So if your math
would be order one,",00:33:51.362,00:33:52.820
this would be the running time.,00:33:52.820,00:33:54.111
"If the math isn't order one,
then it gets more complicated.",00:33:54.111,00:33:59.150
"AUDIENCE: So what's the
running time of a division?",00:33:59.150,00:34:02.432
"PROFESSOR: What is running
time of the division using",00:34:02.432,00:34:04.640
Newton's method?,00:34:04.640,00:34:07.750
"It's the same as the running
time of the multiplication",00:34:07.750,00:34:10.309
"that you're using to
compute your approximations.",00:34:10.309,00:34:12.350
"And it's like two pages
of notes to prove that.",00:34:14.949,00:34:17.889
So let's not go over that now.,00:34:17.889,00:34:20.764
"But the idea is that every
time you're multiplying,",00:34:20.764,00:34:22.889
"you start multiplying
small numbers",00:34:22.889,00:34:24.409
"and the numbers double in size
when you're multiplying them.",00:34:24.409,00:34:26.590
"So only the last
multiplication counts.",00:34:26.590,00:34:28.214
"All the others are
tiny compared to that.",00:34:28.214,00:34:30.420
OK.,00:34:34.679,00:34:35.305
Anything else about Newton?,00:34:35.305,00:34:36.429
"Sorry guys, we have
Newton on the exam",00:34:43.110,00:34:44.840
so we have to go through this.,00:34:44.840,00:34:46.090
"Let's go through some
fun graph problems.",00:34:46.090,00:34:49.900
OK so we kicked off these two.,00:34:49.900,00:34:54.507
"Graphs the BFS edges and
graph transformations.",00:34:54.507,00:34:56.465
"OK I'm going to do a
graph transformation first",00:35:07.532,00:35:09.490
"because I think that's
more useful than BFS edges,",00:35:09.490,00:35:12.166
"but hopefully I'm
going to get to both.",00:35:12.166,00:35:13.790
So suppose I have a graph.,00:35:25.650,00:35:28.460
Each path is either red or blue.,00:35:28.460,00:35:31.220
"By the way, no political
connection whatsoever.",00:35:35.110,00:35:38.440
"And you have weights
on each path.",00:35:38.440,00:35:40.410
"So we want a path from S to T
with the following constraint.",00:35:47.280,00:35:52.430
"So these weights are
the costs of, maybe,",00:35:52.430,00:35:55.650
"how much gas you're
spending to go on that road.",00:35:55.650,00:35:59.250
"So in order to switch from
a red edge to a blue edge,",00:35:59.250,00:36:01.977
you also have to pay some money.,00:36:01.977,00:36:03.310
You have to pay a cost of 5.,00:36:03.310,00:36:06.620
"So if you're going
to go-- if you're",00:36:06.620,00:36:08.920
"going to go from S
to A-- let's call",00:36:08.920,00:36:12.520
"this guy A-- if you're
going to go this way,",00:36:12.520,00:36:16.790
"then your total cost is 3, 1, 4.",00:36:16.790,00:36:23.220
"If you're going to go from S
to B, then if you go this way,",00:36:23.220,00:36:28.600
"your total cost is
going to be 3 plus 1",00:36:28.600,00:36:31.620
"plus 5 for switching from
a red to a blue edge.",00:36:31.620,00:36:35.380
"So the cost for switching
from red to blue is 5.",00:36:35.380,00:36:38.640
"The cost for switching
from blue to red is 5.",00:36:38.640,00:36:42.602
"And I'll let you guys
think of it for a bit",00:36:42.602,00:36:44.393
while I erase the board.,00:36:44.393,00:36:45.393
"AUDIENCE: What's your goal in
playing the best path from--",00:37:09.030,00:37:13.090

Yes.,00:37:28.840,00:37:31.289
"AUDIENCE: It's
kind of on the run,",00:37:31.289,00:37:33.245

the path from S",00:37:55.006,00:38:02.476

the reds.,00:38:07.060,00:38:08.970

just compare the path of S",00:39:16.230,00:39:21.564

I do this so far.",00:39:42.510,00:39:44.559

an edge connecting them",00:40:29.380,00:40:31.340
"on the upper graph, we're
just connecting them.",00:40:31.340,00:40:35.750
"AUDIENCE: Or connect
the respective nodes",00:40:35.750,00:40:38.220
and make it a 5.,00:40:38.220,00:40:40.279
"PROFESSOR: Both
answers work, they",00:40:40.279,00:40:41.695
have the same number of edges.,00:40:41.695,00:40:43.000
"The last answer is
easier to visualize,",00:40:43.000,00:40:44.930
so I'm going to go with that.,00:40:44.930,00:40:47.000
"So I can go from the red
world to the blue world,",00:40:47.000,00:40:49.420
"and back, if I'm
willing to pay 5.",00:40:49.420,00:40:51.190
So this is what--,00:40:55.690,00:40:56.615
"AUDIENCE: And you just use
those with the new edges.",00:41:02.842,00:41:07.261
"Or not DFS, but Dijkstra's.",00:41:07.261,00:41:09.426
"PROFESSOR: All right so all the
edges here are positive, right?",00:41:09.426,00:41:12.050
So I'm going to use Dijkstra.,00:41:12.050,00:41:13.523
"AUDIENCE: Is there any
case in a positive graph",00:41:18.360,00:41:20.564
"that Dijkstra's slower
than Bellman-Ford?",00:41:20.564,00:41:24.860
"Because one is like b log b,
and the other one is like b e.",00:41:24.860,00:41:27.681
Right?,00:41:27.681,00:41:28.180
So if you have a lot of--,00:41:28.180,00:41:29.860
"PROFESSOR: OK so
what is Dijkstra?",00:41:29.860,00:41:31.502
AUDIENCE: B log b-,00:41:31.502,00:41:32.980
PROFESSOR: Almost.,00:41:32.980,00:41:34.132
"AUDIENCE: T log
b, I think, right?",00:41:34.132,00:41:36.020
"That's the theoretical
best case ever,",00:41:36.020,00:41:39.170
"PROFESSOR: So actually,
the theoretical is E plus--",00:41:39.170,00:41:42.569
"AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that's what I meant.",00:41:42.569,00:41:44.068
AUDIENCE: Oh.,00:41:44.068,00:41:45.042
Oh--,00:41:45.042,00:41:45.770
"PROFESSOR: This is what
you get with heaps,",00:41:45.770,00:41:47.561
"so this is what we
got in the P set.",00:41:47.561,00:41:50.722
"AUDIENCE: What
was the first one?",00:41:50.722,00:41:52.500
"AUDIENCE: The first one
is like Fibonacci heaps.",00:41:52.500,00:41:55.375
"It's got a really
high constant factor,",00:41:55.375,00:41:57.000
so you never actually use it.,00:41:57.000,00:41:59.160
"PROFESSOR: So this is a
nice theoretical thing,",00:41:59.160,00:42:01.400
"and this is what
you get in practice.",00:42:01.400,00:42:03.680
"If you use the
regular binary heaps.",00:42:03.680,00:42:06.100
"And so you compare
this to Bellman-Ford",00:42:06.100,00:42:08.290
"which is-- whoops--
V times E. I'm",00:42:08.290,00:42:16.340
"going to guess that this
is faster no matter what.",00:42:16.340,00:42:19.410
"AUDIENCE: Yes, OK.",00:42:19.410,00:42:21.110
"So the theoretical one could
be slower, then, possible.",00:42:21.110,00:42:25.660
The Fibonacci one?,00:42:25.660,00:42:28.430
"Because if you have a ton of
vertices without many edges.",00:42:28.430,00:42:32.499
"PROFESSOR: OK If you
have a ton of vertices",00:42:32.499,00:42:34.290
but not too many edges.,00:42:34.290,00:42:35.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:42:35.580,00:42:36.590
"PROFESSOR: Then you're
saying that this",00:42:36.590,00:42:38.500
"is going to be bigger than--
so what do you do in that case?",00:42:38.500,00:42:42.122
"AUDIENCE: I mean you could just
ignore the vertices, I guess.",00:42:42.122,00:42:45.129
"PROFESSOR: OK so if
you have a ton of",00:42:45.129,00:42:46.670
"vertices and not
that many edges.",00:42:46.670,00:42:48.070
"So if you have edges
smaller-- sorry-- yeah,",00:42:48.070,00:42:51.790
"it's just smaller
than vertices, then",00:42:51.790,00:42:53.750
"some vertices have
to be unconnected.",00:42:53.750,00:42:56.070
So what to do?,00:42:56.070,00:42:57.091
AUDIENCE: You just ignore them.,00:42:57.091,00:42:58.382
"AUDIENCE: You're not going
to reach them anyway.",00:42:58.382,00:42:59.380
"PROFESSOR: How do
you ignore them?",00:42:59.380,00:43:00.930
How do you ignore them in--,00:43:00.930,00:43:01.730
"AUDIENCE: Oh, I see your point.",00:43:01.730,00:43:02.750
"So you're never going
to get to them anyways.",00:43:02.750,00:43:04.624
So--,00:43:04.624,00:43:05.125
"AUDIENCE: Well no, but
once you've started at one,",00:43:05.125,00:43:07.207
"you're going to have
to touch them all.",00:43:07.207,00:43:08.888
"They're all going
to be in the heap.",00:43:08.888,00:43:11.260
Yeah.,00:43:11.260,00:43:12.240
"AUDIENCE: No, don't
put them in the heap",00:43:12.240,00:43:13.906
until you look at them.,00:43:13.906,00:43:16.620
"AUDIENCE: Well, there's
a starting point, right?",00:43:16.620,00:43:19.210
"If you can't go anywhere in the
starting point, you're done.",00:43:19.210,00:43:21.710
"PROFESSOR: OK so you take the
starting point and you do--",00:43:21.710,00:43:26.704
[INTERPOSING VOICES],00:43:26.704,00:43:28.090
"PROFESSOR: Ok so I would take
the starting point and do a BFS",00:43:28.090,00:43:31.740
and ignore everything else.,00:43:31.740,00:43:33.850
"And that is clearly order of
how many vertices and edges that",00:43:33.850,00:43:37.355
are reachable from that.,00:43:37.355,00:43:38.590
"So that will give
you a nice graph.",00:43:38.590,00:43:41.310
"Either that, or if you
initialization your Dijkstra",00:43:41.310,00:43:43.570
"carefully enough, this
actually only reflects",00:43:43.570,00:43:45.765
"the reachable
edges and vertices.",00:43:45.765,00:43:48.630
So you never have this.,00:43:48.630,00:43:50.610
So either one works.,00:43:50.610,00:43:52.730
"In theory mode, it might be
better to say I'll do a BFS",00:43:52.730,00:43:55.235
and reduce the graph.,00:43:55.235,00:43:57.210
Because that's easier to argue.,00:43:57.210,00:43:58.826
Yes.,00:43:58.826,00:43:59.326
"AUDIENCE: So, for
this, when you make all",00:43:59.326,00:44:03.830
"that-- I guess my
question is are we",00:44:03.830,00:44:06.714
"going to be asked to
talk about running times",00:44:06.714,00:44:09.410
for different transformation?,00:44:09.410,00:44:10.880
Or the algorithms?,00:44:10.880,00:44:12.772
"PROFESSOR: Well so at
the very least, last time",00:44:12.772,00:44:14.730
"we said, this is the problem.",00:44:14.730,00:44:17.430
"Give us an algorithm
with this running time.",00:44:17.430,00:44:19.560
AUDIENCE: Right.,00:44:19.560,00:44:19.840
"PROFESSOR: So you have
to be able to know",00:44:19.840,00:44:21.548
your transformations.,00:44:21.548,00:44:22.470
"So not the running for
computing the transformation,",00:44:22.470,00:44:24.636
"but you have to be able to know
how much bigger the graph gets",00:44:24.636,00:44:27.650
"and what that implies
for the running time.",00:44:27.650,00:44:29.811
"Turns out that usually
for these transformations",00:44:29.811,00:44:31.810
"you can compute
them in linear time.",00:44:31.810,00:44:33.310
"So the time for computing
a transformation",00:44:33.310,00:44:35.330
"is much smaller than
the time for running",00:44:35.330,00:44:37.190
Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford.,00:44:37.190,00:44:38.450
"So that's why we don't
really go into that.",00:44:38.450,00:44:43.312
"This one is definitely
linear time.",00:44:43.312,00:44:45.440
"So what happens to the
graph in this case?",00:44:45.440,00:44:50.030
"Number of edges and
number of vertices.",00:44:50.030,00:44:52.503
"AUDIENCE: Number of
edges increases by V",00:44:52.503,00:44:54.868
and number of vertices.,00:44:54.868,00:44:56.760
So increase by V.,00:44:56.760,00:44:59.130
"PROFESSOR: That's
V, and times is 2.",00:44:59.130,00:45:02.692
"So you plug this into
Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra,",00:45:02.692,00:45:04.650
"you find out the
new running time.",00:45:04.650,00:45:06.290
"So every time you see what is
the size of your new graph,",00:45:06.290,00:45:08.990
"and you plug that
into the algorithm.",00:45:08.990,00:45:10.531
"OK so what is the
intuition behind this?",00:45:14.354,00:45:16.020
Did everyone get this problem?,00:45:16.020,00:45:17.370
"So it's the old problem
that we're going through",00:45:20.530,00:45:22.530
"again and again, where you
have a graph that's 2D,",00:45:22.530,00:45:26.050
"and we want to compute
something that Dijkstra",00:45:26.050,00:45:28.977
can't compute on it's own.,00:45:28.977,00:45:30.060
"Or that Bellman-Ford
can't compute on it's own.",00:45:30.060,00:45:32.680
"So in order to be able
to compute those things,",00:45:32.680,00:45:34.800
"we need to add additional
states to the graph.",00:45:34.800,00:45:37.350
"And the way we do that is
we make copies of the graph",00:45:37.350,00:45:39.720
that we call layers.,00:45:39.720,00:45:40.590
"Because we're thinking that if
you take that 2D map, and you",00:45:40.590,00:45:44.550
"create copies of
it, you basically",00:45:44.550,00:45:46.330
"have a 3D graph where there
is the original graph.",00:45:46.330,00:45:49.760
"That's the science part
of the problem, the art",00:45:52.560,00:45:54.520
"part of solving the
problem is figuring out",00:45:54.520,00:45:57.150
"what those layers are
and how you connect them.",00:45:57.150,00:45:59.550
"Because by doing that you
can solve a ton of problems,",00:45:59.550,00:46:01.880
as we have seen in this class.,00:46:01.880,00:46:05.310
"AUDIENCE: Is there a
possibility that you",00:46:05.310,00:46:07.760
"have a very large
number of layers needed",00:46:07.760,00:46:09.991
"to be permutations
of-- different choice",00:46:09.991,00:46:14.598
"to make instead of
just a red or a blue?",00:46:14.598,00:46:17.286
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:46:17.286,00:46:18.190
"So is there a problem where
we had a ton of layers?",00:46:18.190,00:46:21.536
AUDIENCE: Mhmm.,00:46:21.536,00:46:22.160
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:46:22.160,00:46:23.430
"OK so two problems, right?",00:46:23.430,00:46:25.220
AUDIENCE: One for every second.,00:46:25.220,00:46:26.942
[LAUGHS],00:46:26.942,00:46:28.810
"PROFESSOR: And so these
are the layers, presumably.",00:46:28.810,00:46:31.876
"We had two problems that
had a ton of layers.",00:46:31.876,00:46:33.750
"One of them was
the highway problem",00:46:33.750,00:46:35.208
where you had timetables.,00:46:35.208,00:46:37.070
"And there, the number
of layers was the number",00:46:37.070,00:46:39.172
"of minutes in the day
you're considering.",00:46:39.172,00:46:40.880
"So roughly, 1440.",00:46:40.880,00:46:44.010
"And the other one was StarCraft
where the number of layers",00:46:44.010,00:46:47.410
"was something ginormous, right?",00:46:47.410,00:46:50.400
"So as long as that fits
the theory, that's fine.",00:46:50.400,00:46:53.106
"As long as the number of layers
fits whatever the problem wants",00:46:53.106,00:46:55.730
"you to compute, its OK.",00:46:55.730,00:46:57.894
"AUDIENCE: So transforming
another layer,",00:46:57.894,00:47:01.303
"is that like in V time because
copying the number of vertices?",00:47:01.303,00:47:07.150
"PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so you should be",00:47:07.150,00:47:09.946
"able to implement this in
order of V plus E, which",00:47:09.946,00:47:12.640
"is what you need to output
the new graph description.",00:47:12.640,00:47:15.670
I claim that for this you can.,00:47:15.670,00:47:19.405
"AUDIENCE: So for E prime, I
guess, how'd you get that?",00:47:19.405,00:47:24.240
"PROFESSOR: So for
each vertex you",00:47:24.240,00:47:26.375
"are going to create a
red copy and a blue copy.",00:47:26.375,00:47:29.610
"2V, this is easy.",00:47:29.610,00:47:31.080
"Now, the red edges stay in here,
the blue edges stay in here.",00:47:31.080,00:47:34.770
So nothing changed so far.,00:47:34.770,00:47:36.540
"But each red vertex needs to
be connected to the blue vertex",00:47:36.540,00:47:39.280
by an edge of weight 5.,00:47:39.280,00:47:42.320
"So that means that we're going
to copy over the original edges",00:47:42.320,00:47:46.280
"and we're going to add the
edges that connect the vertices.",00:47:46.280,00:47:49.656
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:47:49.656,00:47:51.520
"PROFESSOR: So we're not going
to ask about the running",00:47:51.520,00:47:53.770
"time of the
transformations in general.",00:47:53.770,00:47:55.450
"Because we assume that they
can be done in linear time.",00:47:55.450,00:47:57.990
"But you need to at least have a
sense of whether your graph is",00:47:57.990,00:48:01.150
"going to double,
whether it's going",00:48:01.150,00:48:02.880
"to increase exponentially, or
what's going to happen to it.",00:48:02.880,00:48:06.060
"So let's make a small
tweak to this problem.",00:48:06.060,00:48:08.100
"Suppose that the
instead of having this,",00:48:08.100,00:48:10.150
"I can go from red to
blue, but once I've",00:48:10.150,00:48:13.460
"gone from red to
blue, I can't go back.",00:48:13.460,00:48:16.360
"So I can start out either red
or blue, I can go red to blue,",00:48:16.360,00:48:20.850
"but once I'm in blue I
can't go back to red.",00:48:20.850,00:48:23.794
"AUDIENCE: Make those
directed edges.",00:48:23.794,00:48:25.522
PROFESSOR: From where to where?,00:48:25.522,00:48:27.390
AUDIENCE: Red to blue.,00:48:27.390,00:48:28.785
"PROFESSOR: OK so this is
how I express constraints,",00:48:32.510,00:48:36.600
in constraints among layers.,00:48:36.600,00:48:39.570
"Before, we had two
layers, red and blue.",00:48:39.570,00:48:42.540
"And we connected them by
an edge of weight 5, which",00:48:42.540,00:48:45.216
"says you can go from
red world to blue world,",00:48:45.216,00:48:47.090
"and back, all you
have to do is pay 5.",00:48:47.090,00:48:50.460
"If we have directed edges,
then this is a constraint.",00:48:50.460,00:48:53.510
"If the constraint
said there's no cost,",00:48:53.510,00:48:56.690
"but you can only go
from red to blue,",00:48:56.690,00:48:58.480
you still have to do two layers.,00:48:58.480,00:49:00.440
"And keep track of
which layer you're in.",00:49:00.440,00:49:02.790
"But then your edge
of the weight 0.",00:49:02.790,00:49:05.060
"Since we have to pay,
the edge is weight 5.",00:49:05.060,00:49:07.440
"So we can use layers to
express additional costs,",00:49:10.590,00:49:12.660
or just to express constraints.,00:49:12.660,00:49:13.960

like four of them.",00:49:37.500,00:49:39.100

DFS very briefly, I guess.",00:51:21.060,00:51:24.332
So BFS and DFS.,00:51:27.110,00:51:28.145
What does BFS give us?,00:51:31.200,00:51:32.450
Why is it useful?,00:51:32.450,00:51:35.770
AUDIENCE: Shortest paths.,00:51:35.770,00:51:37.700

the number of edges.",00:51:42.710,00:51:52.370
What does DFS give us?,00:51:52.370,00:51:55.770

I wouldn't call it nothing.,00:51:59.760,00:52:00.885

look at the graph?",00:52:05.090,00:52:07.800
How does it partition the graph?,00:52:07.800,00:52:10.810

"AUDIENCE: The light
distance and the source.",00:52:13.522,00:52:15.355
"PROFESSOR: So you
start with a source,",00:52:17.267,00:52:18.850

A mess?,00:52:34.470,00:52:34.970
"A mess, right?",00:52:34.970,00:52:36.760
So it gives us edge types.,00:52:36.760,00:52:39.890
And it gives us exit times.,00:52:43.650,00:52:46.775

"For each node, BFS or
DFS discovered that node",00:53:11.910,00:53:16.450
"by going from some parent
node across an edge.",00:53:16.450,00:53:19.880

the BFS or to the DFS tree.",00:53:19.880,00:53:23.610

"AUDIENCE: Edges do not
exist in BFS, edge types?",00:55:36.591,00:55:38.591

out of BFS we get levels,",00:55:41.550,00:55:44.160
"and out DFS we get
those edge types.",00:55:44.160,00:55:48.390

about the edge types?",00:55:48.390,00:55:54.360
"PROFESSOR: Some algorithms
use them in their proofs.",00:55:54.360,00:55:57.400
"So the proof for
topological sort",00:55:57.400,00:55:59.610
"uses the fact that in
directed acyclic graphs,",00:55:59.610,00:56:02.030
"you won't have some
types of edges.",00:56:02.030,00:56:04.360
"For the other types
of edges it argues",00:56:04.360,00:56:06.120
"that the order that you
get from topological sort",00:56:06.120,00:56:08.350
is the right order.,00:56:08.350,00:56:09.810
"So it's mostly theoretical
but since we taught you",00:56:09.810,00:56:12.320
"about edge types, we
might ask you about them.",00:56:12.320,00:56:15.295
Yes.,00:56:15.295,00:56:15.794
"AUDIENCE: So does
DFS actually-- is",00:56:15.794,00:56:18.280
"it able to distinguish
between back-crossing over,",00:56:18.280,00:56:21.050

see that the node has already",00:56:21.050,00:56:24.590
been visited by something?,00:56:24.590,00:56:26.930

"There has to be a way to
distinguish between them.",00:56:35.190,00:56:37.780
"AUDIENCE: Because the
DFS does recursive calls",00:56:37.780,00:56:40.604
and you know where the back is.,00:56:40.604,00:56:43.300
"PROFESSOR: So let's
do a DFS tree quickly.",00:56:43.300,00:56:45.690

this, and then this.",00:56:53.630,00:57:02.140

PROFESSOR: OK,00:57:38.819,00:57:39.360

it's downward--",00:57:39.360,00:57:39.830

Is it visited or not?,00:59:08.080,00:59:09.702
AUDIENCE: It's a new vertex.,00:59:09.702,00:59:11.130
AUDIENCE: It's not.,00:59:11.130,00:59:13.990
"PROFESSOR: So v is
not visited yet.",00:59:13.990,00:59:15.450
So this is a tree edge.,00:59:21.160,00:59:23.490
"Now let's compare this
to a forward edge.",00:59:23.490,00:59:25.837
"So what happens
to a forward edge?",00:59:32.180,00:59:34.059
AUDIENCE: Parents of children--,00:59:34.059,00:59:36.933
AUDIENCE: Parent ancestors--,00:59:36.933,00:59:39.345
"PROFESSOR: So you're
at here right now.",00:59:39.345,00:59:40.970
"And you're looking
at the edge uv.",00:59:44.690,00:59:47.260
"Right? so we're
looking at the edge uv.",00:59:47.260,00:59:49.240
"uv would point
downward in the tree.",00:59:49.240,00:59:51.470
What's true about--,00:59:51.470,00:59:53.801
AUDIENCE: v.parent is u.,00:59:53.801,00:59:56.557
AUDIENCE: No--,00:59:56.557,00:59:57.140
AUDIENCE: Not necessarily.,00:59:57.140,00:59:58.223
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:59:58.223,01:00:00.600
So v.parent is u.,01:00:00.600,01:00:04.560
"So it can be the parent,
or the grandparent,",01:00:04.560,01:00:07.220
"or-- so u has to be
somewhere up the tree.",01:00:07.220,01:00:10.350
Right?,01:00:10.350,01:00:11.020
"So I can have a ton
of dot parents here.",01:00:11.020,01:00:14.654
"AUDIENCE: There has to be more
than one dot parent, right?",01:00:14.654,01:00:17.070
"Because otherwise
we get tree edge.",01:00:17.070,01:00:19.278
It can't just be one parent.,01:00:19.278,01:00:21.760
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:00:21.760,01:00:22.644
"AUDIENCE: So you'd have to
recurse up more than once.",01:00:22.644,01:00:25.097
PROFESSOR: Yep.,01:00:25.097,01:00:25.722
"So for a node you go up until
you find u, and if you found u,",01:00:25.722,01:00:29.560
"then it's a forward
edge, otherwise,",01:00:29.560,01:00:33.770
"if you find the root of
the tree then you give up.",01:00:33.770,01:00:35.967
"AUDIENCE: Well then
it's a cross edge.",01:00:35.967,01:00:37.550
"If you go up and you get
to the root but-- oh--",01:00:40.826,01:00:44.230
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, so if
you got to the root,",01:00:44.230,01:00:46.626
it is not the forward edge.,01:00:46.626,01:00:47.750
"Right now we're looking
at what does it mean.",01:00:47.750,01:00:49.880
"So you have to be somewhere
around the ancestor chain of u,",01:00:49.880,01:00:52.745
"so if you keep following v's
parents, you have to see u.",01:00:52.745,01:00:56.070
"If not, it's not
the forward edge.",01:00:56.070,01:00:59.170
OK.,01:00:59.170,01:01:00.010
"And when you see
it, did you visit it",01:01:00.010,01:01:02.070
or did you not visit it?,01:01:02.070,01:01:03.807
AUDIENCE: Already visited.,01:01:03.807,01:01:04.890
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:01:10.650,01:01:11.740
"So now we have two more edge
types, we have back edges,",01:01:11.740,01:01:15.680
and we have cross edges.,01:01:15.680,01:01:17.040
Right?,01:01:17.040,01:01:18.740
Show me a back edge here.,01:01:18.740,01:01:21.608
AUDIENCE: DA.,01:01:21.608,01:01:22.940
PROFESSOR: DA is a back edge.,01:01:22.940,01:01:24.720
"OK back edges are
also reasonably easy.",01:01:24.720,01:01:26.570
So let's do those.,01:01:26.570,01:01:27.320
What's a back edge.,01:01:30.610,01:01:31.630
So I am at u now.,01:01:31.630,01:01:34.525
I'm looking at the edge uv.,01:01:34.525,01:01:37.700
AUDIENCE: It's a cycle.,01:01:37.700,01:01:39.028
AUDIENCE: Node to ancestor.,01:01:39.028,01:01:40.710
PROFESSOR: Sorry?,01:01:40.710,01:01:41.418
"AUDIENCE: It's a
node to an ancestor.",01:01:41.418,01:01:43.330
"PROFESSOR: OK so who
is who's ancestor?",01:01:43.330,01:01:46.295
AUDIENCE: A is D's ancestor.,01:01:46.295,01:01:47.744
AUDIENCE: V is u's ancestor.,01:01:47.744,01:01:48.910
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:01:48.910,01:01:51.680
"So if I keep going,
u.parent many times over,",01:01:51.680,01:02:00.000
"I should eventually
see v. Uhh-- yeah.",01:02:00.000,01:02:05.540
"So the difference
between this and this",01:02:05.540,01:02:09.120
is who is who's parent?,01:02:09.120,01:02:11.324
"AUDIENCE: Wait, wouldn't
u be a parent of v?",01:02:11.324,01:02:16.194
"Because we didn't go from
A to C to D and then at D",01:02:16.194,01:02:20.000
"I realize that I
can go to A, but I",01:02:20.000,01:02:23.302
"won't go because
it's already visited?",01:02:23.302,01:02:27.090
PROFESSOR: Wait.,01:02:27.090,01:02:28.970
AUDIENCE: But assuming that--,01:02:28.970,01:02:30.380
AUDIENCE: A is an ancestor of D.,01:02:30.380,01:02:31.790
"PROFESSOR: So A is
an ancestor of D",01:02:31.790,01:02:33.290
"because by the time
I got to D, I've",01:02:33.290,01:02:35.350
"already set the parent
pointers for C and D.",01:02:35.350,01:02:42.419
AUDIENCE: Yes.,01:02:42.419,01:02:43.385
But-- wait.,01:02:43.385,01:02:45.317
"u.parent is v. Then u is
A here and v is D here--",01:02:45.317,01:02:50.114
AUDIENCE: No u is D here.,01:02:50.114,01:02:51.250
"PROFESSOR: I'm at u
right now, so I'm at D.",01:02:51.250,01:02:53.540
And I'm looking at the edge uv.,01:02:53.540,01:02:57.540
"AUDIENCE: Do we have
a cross edge in here?",01:02:57.540,01:02:59.340
"PROFESSOR: Do we have
a cross edge in here.",01:02:59.340,01:03:01.220
Good question.,01:03:01.220,01:03:01.950
What is the cross edge?,01:03:01.950,01:03:03.838
AUDIENCE: C?,01:03:03.838,01:03:06.680
"PROFESSOR: OK so this
guy is a cross edge.",01:03:06.680,01:03:08.430
"So what is the difference
between a cross edge",01:03:08.430,01:03:10.346
and a forward edge?,01:03:10.346,01:03:12.790
[CLASS MURMURS],01:03:12.790,01:03:16.015
AUDIENCE: It's not an ancestor.,01:03:16.015,01:03:18.440
AUDIENCE: Ancester goes up to S.,01:03:18.440,01:03:22.150
"PROFESSOR: So a cross edge is
very close to a forward edge",01:03:22.150,01:03:26.750
"except u is not an ancestor
of v. v in the DFS tree.",01:03:26.750,01:03:38.670
OK?,01:03:42.750,01:03:44.434
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],01:03:44.434,01:03:47.386
PROFESSOR: Yep.,01:03:47.386,01:03:49.846
Yep.,01:03:49.846,01:03:50.840
"So the only common ancestor
between B and C is the source.",01:03:50.840,01:03:55.998
"OK so please get these
conditions in the notes.",01:04:04.720,01:04:07.850
"So as a summary, if it's
an edge that DFS uses,",01:04:07.850,01:04:11.145
it's a tree edge.,01:04:11.145,01:04:12.970
"If it's going against the way
of the DFS, it's a back edge.",01:04:12.970,01:04:16.960
"If it fast forwards
in DFS, so instead",01:04:16.960,01:04:20.810
"of going one level down, it
does multiple levels down,",01:04:20.810,01:04:24.320
then it's a forward edge.,01:04:24.320,01:04:25.980
"And otherwise, it's weird
edge so it's a cross edge.",01:04:25.980,01:04:30.520
One way to look at it.,01:04:30.520,01:04:31.524
Yeah.,01:04:31.524,01:04:32.024
"AUDIENCE: Is this
only true because we",01:04:32.024,01:04:33.607
were going alphabetically?,01:04:33.607,01:04:35.880
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, this
depends on the order",01:04:35.880,01:04:37.780
"in which the nodes are
listed in the adjacency list.",01:04:37.780,01:04:40.430
"AUDIENCE: So it could've
been pretty different",01:04:40.430,01:04:43.310
if we went from A to E?,01:04:43.310,01:04:46.190
"PROFESSOR: Oh Yeah, yeah.",01:04:46.190,01:04:47.800
Yep.,01:04:47.800,01:04:48.724
"AUDIENCE: I'm trying to
solve this another way.",01:04:48.724,01:04:50.682
The graph information--,01:04:50.682,01:04:54.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah,01:04:54.180,01:04:54.973
"AUDIENCE: --would you say that's
moderate or an easy example?",01:04:54.973,01:04:57.751
The transformation.,01:04:57.751,01:05:00.530
"PROFESSOR: This is
on the easy side.",01:05:00.530,01:05:03.290
"So look at the problems
that we had so far.",01:05:03.290,01:05:05.950
"There are more problems
in this review packet.",01:05:05.950,01:05:08.160
"There are like six,
seven, eight problems.",01:05:08.160,01:05:11.640
It's going to be online.,01:05:11.640,01:05:14.310
"It's the notes for
this recitation.",01:05:14.310,01:05:16.060
"Sorry, bad name.",01:05:16.060,01:05:17.100
"So the notes for
this recitation.",01:05:17.100,01:05:19.550
This is on the easy side.,01:05:19.550,01:05:21.190
"The StarCraft problem, last time
is on the insanely difficult",01:05:21.190,01:05:24.010
"side, so that's not
going to happen.",01:05:24.010,01:05:25.810
"AUDIENCE: I so
don't even get that.",01:05:25.810,01:05:27.910
"PROFESSOR: That's
on the hard side.",01:05:27.910,01:05:30.060
