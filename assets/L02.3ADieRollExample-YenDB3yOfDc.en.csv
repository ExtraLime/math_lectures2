"This is a simple example where
we want to just apply the",00:00:02.910,00:00:06.670
"formula for conditional
probabilities",00:00:06.670,00:00:08.630
and see what we get.,00:00:08.630,00:00:10.610
"The example involves a
four-sided die, if you can",00:00:10.610,00:00:15.140
"imagine such an object, which
we roll twice, and we record",00:00:15.140,00:00:19.300
"the first roll, and
the second roll.",00:00:19.300,00:00:21.830
"So there are 16 possible
outcomes.",00:00:21.830,00:00:24.660
"We assume to keep things simple,
that each one of those",00:00:24.660,00:00:28.350
"16 possible outcomes, each
one of them has the same",00:00:28.350,00:00:32.820
"probability, so each outcome
has the probability 1/16.",00:00:32.820,00:00:35.800
"Let us consider now a particular
event B on which",00:00:39.820,00:00:43.250
we're going to condition.,00:00:43.250,00:00:44.460
"This is the event under which
the smaller of the two die",00:00:44.460,00:00:49.286
"rolls is equal to 2, which means
that one of the dice",00:00:49.286,00:00:53.990
"must have resulted in two, and
the other die has resulted in",00:00:53.990,00:00:57.970
"something which is
2 or larger.",00:00:57.970,00:01:01.220
"So this can happen
in multiple ways.",00:01:01.220,00:01:03.800
"And here are the different
ways that it can happen.",00:01:03.800,00:01:07.130
"So at 2, 2, or 2, 3, or 2, 4;
then a 3, 2 and a 4, 2.",00:01:07.130,00:01:14.100
"All of these are outcomes in
which one of the dice has a",00:01:14.100,00:01:18.080
"value equal to 2, and
the other die",00:01:18.080,00:01:20.200
is at least as large.,00:01:20.200,00:01:22.880
So we condition on this event.,00:01:22.880,00:01:25.560
"This results in a conditional
model where each one of those",00:01:25.560,00:01:29.520
"five outcomes are equally likely
since they used to be",00:01:29.520,00:01:33.820
"equally likely in the
original model.",00:01:33.820,00:01:36.759
"Now let's look at
this quantity.",00:01:36.759,00:01:38.539
"The maximum of the
two die rolls--",00:01:38.539,00:01:41.340
"that is, the largest
of the results.",00:01:41.340,00:01:43.960
"And let us try to calculate
the following quantity--",00:01:43.960,00:01:47.710
"the conditional probability that
the maximum is equal to 1",00:01:47.710,00:01:52.240
"given that the minimum
is equal to 2.",00:01:52.240,00:01:55.420
"So this is the conditional
probability of",00:01:55.420,00:01:57.820
this particular outcome.,00:01:57.820,00:02:00.050
"Well, this particular outcome
cannot happen.",00:02:00.050,00:02:02.480
"If I tell you that the smaller
number is 2, then the larger",00:02:02.480,00:02:06.450
"number cannot be equal to 1, so
this outcome is impossible,",00:02:06.450,00:02:10.669
"and therefore this conditional
probability is equal to 0.",00:02:10.669,00:02:14.870
"Let's do something a little
more interesting.",00:02:14.870,00:02:17.550
"Let us now look at the
conditional probability that",00:02:17.550,00:02:20.910
"the maximum is equal to 3 given
the information that",00:02:20.910,00:02:26.690
event B has occurred.,00:02:26.690,00:02:29.190
"It's best to draw a picture
and see what that event",00:02:29.190,00:02:32.210
corresponds to.,00:02:32.210,00:02:33.990
M is equal to 3--,00:02:33.990,00:02:35.829
the maximum is equal to 3--,00:02:35.829,00:02:38.110
"if one of the dice resulted
in a 3, and the other die",00:02:38.110,00:02:44.500
"resulted in something
that's 3 or less.",00:02:44.500,00:02:48.190
"So this event here corresponds
to the blue",00:02:48.190,00:02:53.770
region in this diagram.,00:02:53.770,00:02:56.630
"Now let us try to calculate the
conditional probability by",00:02:56.630,00:03:00.610
just following the definition.,00:03:00.610,00:03:03.110
"The conditional probability of
one event given another is the",00:03:03.110,00:03:07.910
"probability that
both of them--",00:03:07.910,00:03:10.860
both of the two events--,00:03:10.860,00:03:12.900
"occur, divided by the
probability of the",00:03:12.900,00:03:18.810
conditioning event.,00:03:18.810,00:03:20.690
"That is, out of the total
probability in the",00:03:20.690,00:03:23.880
"conditioning event, we ask,
what fraction of that",00:03:23.880,00:03:27.000
"probability is assigned to
outcomes in which the event of",00:03:27.000,00:03:31.060
interest is also happening?,00:03:31.060,00:03:33.730
So what is this event?,00:03:33.730,00:03:36.200
"The maximum is equal to 3,
which is the blue event.",00:03:36.200,00:03:40.100
"And simultaneously, the red
event is happening.",00:03:40.100,00:03:44.500
"These two events intersect
only in two places.",00:03:44.500,00:03:48.840
"This is the intersection
of the two events.",00:03:48.840,00:03:52.020
"And the probability of that
intersection is 2 out of 16,",00:03:52.020,00:03:58.480
"since there's 16 outcomes and
that event happens only with",00:03:58.480,00:04:02.720
two particular outcomes.,00:04:02.720,00:04:04.910
"So this gives us 2/16
in the numerator.",00:04:04.910,00:04:09.360
How about the denominator?,00:04:09.360,00:04:11.210
"Event B consists of a total
of five possible outcomes.",00:04:11.210,00:04:14.990
"Each one has probability 1/16,
so this is 5/16, so the final",00:04:14.990,00:04:20.360
answer is 2/5.,00:04:20.360,00:04:23.860
"We could have gotten that same
answer in a simple and perhaps",00:04:23.860,00:04:28.470
more intuitive way.,00:04:28.470,00:04:29.870
"In the original model, all
outcomes were equally likely.",00:04:29.870,00:04:33.409
"Therefore, in the conditional
model, the five outcomes that",00:04:33.409,00:04:37.470
"belong to B should also
be equally likely.",00:04:37.470,00:04:41.470
"Out of those five, there's two
of them that make the event of",00:04:41.470,00:04:45.980
interest to occur.,00:04:45.980,00:04:48.190
"So given that we live in B,
there's two ways out of five",00:04:48.190,00:04:52.500
"that the event of interest
will materialize.",00:04:52.500,00:04:54.940
So the event of interest has,00:04:54.940,00:04:57.159
conditional probability [equal to],00:04:57.159,00:04:59.230
2/5.,00:04:59.230,00:05:00.480
