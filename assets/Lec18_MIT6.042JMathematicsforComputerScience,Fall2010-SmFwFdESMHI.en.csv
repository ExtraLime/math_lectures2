PROFESSOR: Let's get started.,00:00:23.170,00:00:25.090
Drop date is coming up.,00:00:25.090,00:00:26.540
"So that you didn't do
very well on the midterm,",00:00:26.540,00:00:28.499
"and you haven't been
doing your homework,",00:00:28.499,00:00:30.206
"and you haven't been
going to recitation,",00:00:30.206,00:00:32.070
"I would strongly
consider drop date.",00:00:32.070,00:00:35.580
"And you can see your
TAs to get some idea",00:00:35.580,00:00:37.820
"of what your grades
are, and what you're",00:00:37.820,00:00:40.040
"likely to do if you keep on
giving the same performance",00:00:40.040,00:00:43.410
you've had so far.,00:00:43.410,00:00:46.400
"Now, today, we're going to
switch gears again and cover",00:00:46.400,00:00:49.740
the last topic for the course.,00:00:49.740,00:00:51.577
"For the remainder
of the course, we're",00:00:51.577,00:00:53.160
going to talk about probability.,00:00:53.160,00:00:55.800
"It's one of the most
important subjects in all",00:00:55.800,00:00:58.880
of math or computer science.,00:00:58.880,00:01:00.540
"In fact, I was at a frat
last night for dinner,",00:01:00.540,00:01:03.020
"and they asked me what my
favorite algorithm was.",00:01:03.020,00:01:05.550
"And I couldn't really think
about my favorite algorithm",00:01:05.550,00:01:08.340
"was, but in terms of one of the
most important subjects for you",00:01:08.340,00:01:11.370
"to know about, after induction,
it's probably probability.",00:01:11.370,00:01:15.730
"It's really important across
math and computer science.",00:01:15.730,00:01:18.850
"Most of the upper level courses
you take in computer science",00:01:18.850,00:01:21.812
are going to use probability.,00:01:21.812,00:01:23.020
"They're going to expect
you to know the basics.",00:01:23.020,00:01:25.660
"For example, when you're
designing algorithms in 006",00:01:25.660,00:01:29.110
"or 6046, you're going to
be designing in some cases",00:01:29.110,00:01:33.360
"probabilistic algorithms--
algorithms that flip coins",00:01:33.360,00:01:36.990
"or generate random
numbers to get the result.",00:01:36.990,00:01:39.910
"And by using randomness,
they run faster.",00:01:39.910,00:01:43.410
"If you're doing software
engineering later,",00:01:43.410,00:01:45.800
"you're going to use
probability when",00:01:45.800,00:01:47.300
"you analyze system performance
or build hash tables.",00:01:47.300,00:01:51.950
"Probability is used
in information theory,",00:01:51.950,00:01:54.190
"in coding theory,
in cryptography.",00:01:54.190,00:01:57.590
"In fact, our nation's
codes, their security",00:01:57.590,00:02:01.150
"depends on
probabilistic analysis.",00:02:01.150,00:02:04.150
"Because the bad guys
are using probabilistic",00:02:04.150,00:02:06.580
"algorithms to break
the crypto-system.",00:02:06.580,00:02:09.199
"And we'll give an example of
that in another week or so.",00:02:09.199,00:02:12.920
"Probability is
obviously important",00:02:12.920,00:02:14.820
"if you're doing game theory
or if you like to gamble,",00:02:14.820,00:02:18.240
really critical in gambling.,00:02:18.240,00:02:19.480
"In fact, we're going to analyze
a lot of different gambling",00:02:19.480,00:02:22.100
games over the next few weeks.,00:02:22.100,00:02:23.350
"And for fun, we'll
play some in class.",00:02:23.350,00:02:25.710
"In fact, we'll play
one later today.",00:02:25.710,00:02:28.170
"And it's amazing how often
the intuition is wrong.",00:02:28.170,00:02:32.010
"You think the
answer goes one way,",00:02:32.010,00:02:33.440
"and then it's
actually the other.",00:02:33.440,00:02:36.000
"Probability is important in
the study of fault tolerance.",00:02:36.000,00:02:39.160
"For example, how
do you figure out",00:02:39.160,00:02:41.090
"the probability there's going
to be some critical failure that",00:02:41.090,00:02:43.730
"causes the space
shuttle to crash?",00:02:43.730,00:02:46.120
"Or a critical failure that
causes a nuclear plant",00:02:46.120,00:02:48.990
to meltdown?,00:02:48.990,00:02:50.350
"That's done through
probabilistic analysis.",00:02:50.350,00:02:52.250
"And we'll do some
examples of that.",00:02:52.250,00:02:54.780
"Probability comes
up in everyday life.",00:02:54.780,00:02:57.370
We just had an election.,00:02:57.370,00:02:59.112
"And running up to
the election, you",00:02:59.112,00:03:00.570
"get all these polls that
say that's so-and-so",00:03:00.570,00:03:03.780
"is ahead of so-and-so by three
points with a margin of error",00:03:03.780,00:03:08.060
of five points.,00:03:08.060,00:03:09.780
"So it's a statistical dead
heat, is what they say.",00:03:09.780,00:03:12.650
"Well, what the heck
does that mean?",00:03:12.650,00:03:14.930
"In fact, usually they've
got it screwed up.",00:03:14.930,00:03:16.990
"And we're going to spend
the recitation where you're",00:03:16.990,00:03:19.156
"going to do a margin of
error analysis for a poll,",00:03:19.156,00:03:22.880
"and see how many people
do you need to poll to get",00:03:22.880,00:03:25.500
a pretty accurate result?,00:03:25.500,00:03:28.490
Comes up in the medical studies.,00:03:28.490,00:03:31.390
"Does cholesterol
cause heart disease?",00:03:31.390,00:03:34.400
Does smoking cause lung cancer?,00:03:34.400,00:03:37.090
How effective is a certain drug?,00:03:37.090,00:03:39.410
"Say you get tested for a disease
and it comes back positive.",00:03:39.410,00:03:43.780
"Well, there's false positives
and false negatives.",00:03:43.780,00:03:45.950
"What are the chances you
really have the disease?",00:03:45.950,00:03:48.970
So the list goes on and on.,00:03:48.970,00:03:51.942
"In fact, we're going to
see all these examples.",00:03:51.942,00:03:53.900
"We've got eight lectures
and eight recitations.",00:03:53.900,00:03:55.910
"And there's just no end
of interesting examples",00:03:55.910,00:03:58.020
"where probability
comes into play.",00:03:58.020,00:04:00.770
"The bad news is,
probability is probably",00:04:00.770,00:04:04.920
"the most misunderstood
subject in all of mathematics",00:04:04.920,00:04:09.400
and the sciences.,00:04:09.400,00:04:11.370
"In fact, Mark Twain
once said, there's",00:04:11.370,00:04:15.750
"three kinds of lies-- lies,
damned lies, and statistics,",00:04:15.750,00:04:23.300
meaning probability.,00:04:23.300,00:04:25.210
"Because it's so easy
to lie with statistics.",00:04:25.210,00:04:29.890
"And we're going to see lots
and lots of examples of that.",00:04:29.890,00:04:33.750
"In fact, newspaper
articles, you know,",00:04:33.750,00:04:36.790
"have all sorts of things that
are just horribly fallacious",00:04:36.790,00:04:40.000
based on statistics.,00:04:40.000,00:04:41.032
And we'll see examples.,00:04:41.032,00:04:41.990
"In fact, we're going to even
debunk a very famous article--",00:04:41.990,00:04:46.690
"published research paper--
by some famous computer",00:04:46.690,00:04:48.920
scientists at Berkeley.,00:04:48.920,00:04:50.720
"Where they got to a conclusion
using a very standard method",00:04:50.720,00:04:53.610
"you see all the time--
completely fallacious.",00:04:53.610,00:04:56.650
And we'll see that.,00:04:56.650,00:04:58.120
"So you can think of that
as, I'm going to teach you",00:04:58.120,00:05:00.280
how to lie with statistics.,00:05:00.280,00:05:03.080
"Even better, how not to be taken
in by incorrect arguments using",00:05:03.080,00:05:08.380
probability theory.,00:05:08.380,00:05:10.860
"Now, at MIT, it's
probably the subject",00:05:10.860,00:05:15.390
"that most often
trips up students",00:05:15.390,00:05:17.910
in their PhD qualifying exams.,00:05:17.910,00:05:20.760
"You know, there's no
better way to strike",00:05:20.760,00:05:23.450
"terror in the heart of a
student then to be sitting there",00:05:23.450,00:05:27.109
"and ask them a
question while they're",00:05:27.109,00:05:28.650
"at the board, what's the
probability that foo happens?",00:05:28.650,00:05:32.480
"It's like panic sets
in when they've got",00:05:32.480,00:05:34.760
to do a probabilistic analysis.,00:05:34.760,00:05:36.060
"And now, MIT PhD
students are good.",00:05:36.060,00:05:39.330
"You know, they can crank out
the most horrendous calculation,",00:05:39.330,00:05:42.260
"no problem, come up with really
clever ideas to solve problems.",00:05:42.260,00:05:45.880
"But you get into probability,
it gets into trouble.",00:05:45.880,00:05:49.170
"In fact, even the other
faculty sitting there",00:05:49.170,00:05:51.070
"start squirming around when
this question's being posed.",00:05:51.070,00:05:55.050
"You know, and probability
questions are--",00:05:55.050,00:05:57.894
"and we'll see some
examples today-- are always",00:05:57.894,00:05:59.810
"the best at faculty
parties, just",00:05:59.810,00:06:01.980
can ruin people's whole night.,00:06:01.980,00:06:03.450
"You know, what's the
probability this happens?",00:06:03.450,00:06:05.366
And it's some weird answer.,00:06:05.366,00:06:06.580
"Now, the strange thing
about this-- well,",00:06:09.180,00:06:11.130
"first strange thing is that our
human intuition is terrible.",00:06:11.130,00:06:13.820
And you will see that.,00:06:13.820,00:06:15.380
"Your intuition will
be wrong, just the way",00:06:15.380,00:06:17.960
"our brains are
created genetically.",00:06:17.960,00:06:21.840
"But the good news is that
probability can be very simple.",00:06:21.840,00:06:25.880
"If you force yourself to just go
to the basic principles-- which",00:06:25.880,00:06:29.880
"we're going to cover-- and
go through the basic template",00:06:29.880,00:06:32.920
"of how to solve a problem--
which we're going to cover--",00:06:32.920,00:06:35.630
"it is easy, and
you can't go wrong.",00:06:35.630,00:06:39.370
"The key is forcing yourself
to just actually write it",00:06:39.370,00:06:43.660
"down, follow the
basic principles,",00:06:43.660,00:06:45.850
and get to the answer.,00:06:45.850,00:06:47.110
"As opposed to saying, oh, the
answer's that and here's why.",00:06:47.110,00:06:51.969
"Because it's amazing how
often you'll be wrong if",00:06:51.969,00:06:54.010
"you just try to rely
on your intuition.",00:06:54.010,00:06:57.620
"Now, we're going to start
today our study of probability",00:06:57.620,00:07:00.730
"with a famous, simple game.",00:07:00.730,00:07:04.760
"And the game is known as
the Monty Hall problem.",00:07:04.760,00:07:08.270
"Now, do you all know
who Monty Hall was?",00:07:08.270,00:07:11.500
You're probably too young.,00:07:11.500,00:07:12.590
"Yeah, OK, not many people
know who Monte Hall was.",00:07:12.590,00:07:14.850
"But back in the 1970s, there
was a very popular daytime TV",00:07:14.850,00:07:19.530
"show-- a game show--
called Let's Make a Deal.",00:07:19.530,00:07:24.850
And it was a great show.,00:07:24.850,00:07:26.090
"It was the precursor
of Wheel of Fortune--",00:07:26.090,00:07:27.870
"if you're old enough to
have seen that-- and then",00:07:27.870,00:07:30.240
Deal or No Deal after that.,00:07:30.240,00:07:31.900
"There's always some game
show that's really popular.",00:07:31.900,00:07:34.500
"Anyway, back in the '70s,
it was Let's Make a Deal,",00:07:34.500,00:07:37.660
and Monty Hall was the host.,00:07:37.660,00:07:40.132
"How many people have ever
heard of Let's Make a Deal?",00:07:40.132,00:07:42.340
"Raise your hand if you've
ever heard of that.",00:07:42.340,00:07:44.214
"OK, so it still has some fame.",00:07:44.214,00:07:45.630
Good.,00:07:45.630,00:07:46.460
All right.,00:07:46.460,00:07:47.690
"Now, Monty Hall, of
course, was the precursor",00:07:47.690,00:07:50.970
"of Pat Sajak of Wheel of
Fortune and Howie Mandel,",00:07:50.970,00:07:54.740
"you know, from Deal or No Deal.",00:07:54.740,00:07:56.410
"And his assistant
was Carol Merrill.",00:07:56.410,00:07:59.070
"She was also famous as
the beautiful assistant.",00:07:59.070,00:08:02.620
"Now, in Let's Make a
Deal, they TV audience",00:08:02.620,00:08:05.430
"would come dressed
up in wild costumes.",00:08:05.430,00:08:08.890
"And Monty would go
into the audience",00:08:08.890,00:08:12.690
"and pick out a contestant
from the audience based",00:08:12.690,00:08:15.240
"on how wild their
costume was-- you know,",00:08:15.240,00:08:17.620
"somebody that would
look interesting for TV.",00:08:17.620,00:08:19.910
"And what he would do is he'd
buy a piece of the costume--",00:08:19.910,00:08:22.440
"maybe their hat or
shirt or something--",00:08:22.440,00:08:25.290
"and give them $100 for a
piece of their costume.",00:08:25.290,00:08:27.960
"And then he would say,
hey look, you know,",00:08:27.960,00:08:31.370
"if you give me back the
$100 I just gave you,",00:08:31.370,00:08:34.340
"I'm going to let you have
your choice of what's",00:08:34.340,00:08:37.230
"behind door number one,
door number two, or door",00:08:37.230,00:08:39.669
number three.,00:08:39.669,00:08:40.730
"Or sometimes it would be box
number one, box number two,",00:08:40.730,00:08:43.320
and box number three.,00:08:43.320,00:08:45.260
"Now, because people have
seen the game show before,",00:08:45.260,00:08:48.560
"they knew that behind
one of the doors",00:08:48.560,00:08:50.620
"was a brand new car or
underneath one of the boxes",00:08:50.620,00:08:54.380
was a diamond ring.,00:08:54.380,00:08:56.520
"And behind the other doors
were goats or donkeys",00:08:56.520,00:09:00.520
or something totally useless.,00:09:00.520,00:09:01.960
"So one of the three
doors has a big prize,",00:09:01.960,00:09:04.010
the other two got nothing.,00:09:04.010,00:09:07.930
"But because anybody would pay
$100 for a one-in-three chance",00:09:07.930,00:09:11.790
"at the car, they played.",00:09:11.790,00:09:12.990
And they're on national TV.,00:09:12.990,00:09:14.820
"So they give the $100 back to
Monty, and they pick a door,",00:09:14.820,00:09:18.930
say door number one.,00:09:18.930,00:09:21.830
"Monty wouldn't open door
number one right away.",00:09:21.830,00:09:24.690
"What he would do is say, OK,
you're sure you like that?",00:09:24.690,00:09:28.110
All right.,00:09:28.110,00:09:29.792
"Carol, can you
please reveal what's",00:09:29.792,00:09:31.250

donkeys sitting there",00:09:35.270,00:09:37.150

only two doors left.",00:09:38.920,00:09:40.650
One of them has the car.,00:09:40.650,00:09:42.500

well, you've seen the goat.",00:09:42.500,00:09:46.070
"There's a car behind
one of the two doors.",00:09:46.070,00:09:48.510

with door number one?",00:09:48.510,00:09:50.620

and get door number two?",00:09:50.620,00:09:54.260

screaming, you know, switch,",00:09:54.260,00:09:56.960

number one, door number two.",00:09:56.960,00:09:59.570

and his career's ruined.,00:10:18.100,00:10:20.560

he gets the right strategy here.",00:10:20.560,00:10:24.250

going to look at today",00:10:24.250,00:10:27.380

the contestant should",00:10:27.380,00:10:29.670

little different.",00:10:43.330,00:10:45.300

"Well, we've got a couple.",00:18:15.810,00:18:17.410
"How many people think
it's 50-50 if you switch?",00:18:17.410,00:18:20.940
"Yeah, a lot.",00:18:20.940,00:18:21.810
"How many people think it's
worse than 50-50 if you switch?",00:18:21.810,00:18:26.250
Not many.,00:18:26.250,00:18:26.990
"How many people think
it's better than 50-50?",00:18:26.990,00:18:29.426
"Ah, that's I think most of
you there, pretty close.",00:18:29.426,00:18:33.250
"All right, now, the
answers to these questions",00:18:33.250,00:18:36.090
"are very easy to work out--
and we're going to do it.",00:18:36.090,00:18:38.320
"We're going to figure out
the probability exactly--",00:18:38.320,00:18:40.700
if you use mathematics.,00:18:40.700,00:18:42.960
"But it's really
tricky if you try",00:18:42.960,00:18:44.500
"to use intuition or
hand waving arguments.",00:18:44.500,00:18:48.490
"Now, for example,
this game-- Carol",00:18:48.490,00:18:51.610
"wants to leave-- yeah, Carol,
let's give Carol a hand here.",00:18:51.610,00:18:54.220
She did a wonderful job.,00:18:54.220,00:18:56.790
Well done.,00:18:56.790,00:18:57.526
[APPLAUSE],00:18:57.526,00:18:58.804
Yikes.,00:19:00.020,00:19:02.249
"I'm going to get in
trouble here, too, now.",00:19:02.249,00:19:04.040
You know?,00:19:04.040,00:19:05.590
OK.,00:19:05.590,00:19:07.770
"For example, this game, and
this particular version of it,",00:19:07.770,00:19:11.710
"was the subject of a series of
articles in Parade Magazine.",00:19:11.710,00:19:16.050
"This is an old version
of Parade Magazine.",00:19:16.050,00:19:19.500
"And what I'm going to do is
hand out the series of articles.",00:19:19.500,00:19:22.260
"And the TAs are going to
help me hand these out.",00:19:22.260,00:19:26.130
"There was three of them with
a lot of write-ins here.",00:19:26.130,00:19:28.580
"I'm going to give
you a bundle here.",00:19:28.580,00:19:32.724
There you go.,00:19:32.724,00:19:34.859
There you go.,00:19:34.859,00:19:35.400
I'll give the rest to Oscar.,00:19:35.400,00:19:36.707
Great.,00:19:39.960,00:19:40.460
"Now, Marilyn has a column
every week in Parade.",00:19:54.100,00:19:59.030
"And people write in
questions, usually",00:19:59.030,00:20:01.200
"about their love life
and weird things.",00:20:01.200,00:20:04.700
And she answers them.,00:20:04.700,00:20:06.350
"And she's well
qualified to do this",00:20:06.350,00:20:08.210
"because she's listed in the
Guinness Book of World Records",00:20:08.210,00:20:10.890
"as having the highest IQ of
a human being ever, at 228.",00:20:10.890,00:20:16.350
"And so, you know
she's in some sense",00:20:16.350,00:20:18.100
"qualified to answer any
question that is written in.",00:20:18.100,00:20:21.600
"Now, in September of 1990-- and
we're passing out the articles",00:20:21.600,00:20:26.390
"now and it shows
the first article--",00:20:26.390,00:20:32.880
"this guy named Craig
Whitaker writes in and asks",00:20:32.880,00:20:36.700
"Marilyn if you should
switch in this game.",00:20:36.700,00:20:40.469
So you can all read that.,00:20:40.469,00:20:41.510
"It says, suppose you're on
a game show and you're given",00:20:41.510,00:20:43.830
the choice of three doors.,00:20:43.830,00:20:45.500
Behind one door is a car.,00:20:45.500,00:20:47.120
"Behind the others, goats.",00:20:47.120,00:20:49.180
"You pick a door, say
number one, and the host,",00:20:49.180,00:20:52.470
"who knows what's
behind the doors,",00:20:52.470,00:20:54.120
"opens another one, say door
three, which has a goat.",00:20:54.120,00:20:58.910
"He says to you, do you want
to pick door number two?",00:20:58.910,00:21:02.480
"Is it to your
advantage to switch?",00:21:02.480,00:21:05.055
"Now, Marilyn writes back
saying, very plainly,",00:21:07.720,00:21:10.670
"yes, you should switch.",00:21:10.670,00:21:12.070
"The first door had a
one-in-three chance of winning.",00:21:12.070,00:21:14.880
"The second door has a
two-in-three chance.",00:21:14.880,00:21:18.530
"Here's a good way to
visualize what's going on.",00:21:18.530,00:21:21.320
"Suppose there are
a million doors.",00:21:21.320,00:21:24.540
You pick door number one.,00:21:24.540,00:21:26.780
"Then the host, who knows
what's behind the doors,",00:21:26.780,00:21:29.480
"reveals every other door
but one and 777,777.",00:21:29.480,00:21:36.710
"Well, it would sort
of look like 777,777",00:21:36.710,00:21:39.900
"is the one with the car, and
you'd switch pretty fast.",00:21:39.900,00:21:43.205
All right that's her argument.,00:21:43.205,00:21:44.620
"That is not exactly a
proof, OK, that the answer",00:21:44.620,00:21:47.990
"is you should switch or
that the probability is 2/3.",00:21:47.990,00:21:52.450
All right?,00:21:52.450,00:21:53.270
"Now, because she's
giving another problem",00:21:53.270,00:21:55.140
"with a million doors, but you've
got a problem with three doors.",00:21:55.140,00:21:58.070
"And as we'll see in recitation
tomorrow, the number of doors",00:21:58.070,00:22:01.530
"actually matters in terms
of some strategies here.",00:22:01.530,00:22:03.980
"So people weren't
convinced by this.",00:22:06.540,00:22:09.760
"And so, if you look
to the next page,",00:22:09.760,00:22:11.510
you see people writing in.,00:22:11.510,00:22:12.930
And there's a lot a write-ins.,00:22:12.930,00:22:15.340
"The first one's by Robert
Sachs, who's actually--",00:22:15.340,00:22:18.830
"I looked him up on
Google, and he's",00:22:18.830,00:22:21.360
"on the faculty at
George Mason University.",00:22:21.360,00:22:25.450
"I also noticed that
in his history,",00:22:25.450,00:22:27.390
he got his BA from Harvard.,00:22:27.390,00:22:29.400
"So that should tell you
something about the quality",00:22:29.400,00:22:32.130
of his response here.,00:22:32.130,00:22:34.400
"He says, since you seem to enjoy
coming straight to the point,",00:22:34.400,00:22:38.330
I'll do the same.,00:22:38.330,00:22:39.560
You blew it.,00:22:39.560,00:22:40.890
Let me explain.,00:22:40.890,00:22:42.170
"If one door is
shown to be a loser,",00:22:42.170,00:22:44.120
"that information
changes the probability",00:22:44.120,00:22:47.120
"of either remaining
choice, neither of which",00:22:47.120,00:22:49.940
"has any reason to
be more likely.",00:22:49.940,00:22:53.210
"And so, the answer is one
half of having the car.",00:22:53.210,00:22:56.340
"Then he says, as a
professional mathematician,",00:22:56.340,00:22:58.830
"I'm very concerned with
the general public's",00:22:58.830,00:23:00.830
lack of mathematical skills.,00:23:00.830,00:23:02.760
"Please help by
confessing your error.",00:23:02.760,00:23:04.545
"And in the future,
be more careful.",00:23:04.545,00:23:07.090
"Just a little gratuitous
extra statement there.",00:23:07.090,00:23:10.810
"Next we've got a PhD from
Florida, Scott Smith, who says,",00:23:10.810,00:23:14.270
"you blew it, and
you blew it big.",00:23:14.270,00:23:16.600
"Since you seem to
have difficulty",00:23:16.600,00:23:18.210
"grasping the basic principles
at work here, I'll explain.",00:23:18.210,00:23:22.350
"After the host reveals
a goat, you now",00:23:22.350,00:23:24.440
"have a one-in-two
chance of being correct.",00:23:24.440,00:23:26.890
"Whether you change
your selection or not,",00:23:26.890,00:23:29.530
the odds are the same.,00:23:29.530,00:23:31.150
"There is enough mathematical
illiteracy in this country,",00:23:31.150,00:23:34.140
"and we don't need the world's
highest IQ propagating more.",00:23:34.140,00:23:37.560
Shame.,00:23:37.560,00:23:39.199
"Well, now, this guy is
right about that one point",00:23:39.199,00:23:41.240
"about mathematical
illiteracy in the country.",00:23:41.240,00:23:44.370
"The next guy, Barry
Pasternack, you know,",00:23:44.370,00:23:47.290
"he lists himself as California
Faculty Association.",00:23:47.290,00:23:50.360
"He actually was president of the
California Faculty Association.",00:23:50.360,00:23:55.050
"He says, your answer to
the question is an error,",00:23:55.050,00:23:57.870
"but if it's any constellation,
many of my academic colleagues",00:23:57.870,00:24:01.120
"have also been stumped
by this problem.",00:24:01.120,00:24:04.080
OK.,00:24:04.080,00:24:04.580
"So next page,
Marilyn writes back.",00:24:04.580,00:24:07.360
"And she says, you
know, good heavens,",00:24:07.360,00:24:09.510
"with so much learned
opposition, I'll",00:24:09.510,00:24:11.572
"bet this is going to keep math
classes all over the country",00:24:11.572,00:24:14.030
busy on Monday.,00:24:14.030,00:24:14.960
And it did.,00:24:14.960,00:24:15.760
"It was a huge uproar
at the time about this.",00:24:15.760,00:24:18.910
"So now she tries
to explain it some",00:24:18.910,00:24:22.230
"more with shells and stuff
under the shells and so forth,",00:24:22.230,00:24:26.430
trying to argue it.,00:24:26.430,00:24:29.040
"And then she says, just try
the experiment six times",00:24:29.040,00:24:32.750
"or something, and you'll see.",00:24:32.750,00:24:35.116
"You know, but, it's
not really convincing.",00:24:35.116,00:24:38.300
It's not a proof.,00:24:38.300,00:24:39.640
"She's sort of waving hands at
it to give you some idea of why",00:24:39.640,00:24:42.340
she thinks she's right.,00:24:42.340,00:24:43.686
"But when I look at
the hand waving here",00:24:43.686,00:24:45.310
"versus the hand waving
on those faculty,",00:24:45.310,00:24:48.080
"well, it's all hand waving.",00:24:48.080,00:24:50.460
All right.,00:24:50.460,00:24:50.960
"So you go to the next
page, and now the letters",00:24:50.960,00:24:53.740
are getting a little nastier.,00:24:53.740,00:24:55.910
"We got another University
of Florida guy.",00:24:55.910,00:24:58.670
"He says, may I suggest
you obtain and refer",00:24:58.670,00:25:01.450
"to a standard textbook

"before you try to answer a
question of this type again.",00:25:03.860,00:25:07.720

"Perhaps you should keep
a few addresses for help",00:25:15.780,00:25:17.970
with future columns.,00:25:17.970,00:25:20.380

"I looked him up, too.",00:25:26.525,00:25:27.400
It's not fake.,00:25:27.400,00:25:28.150
That's his real name.,00:25:28.150,00:25:29.820

"You are utterly incorrect
about the game show question.",00:25:41.080,00:25:44.260
"And I hope this controversy
will call some public attention",00:25:44.260,00:25:47.170
"to the serious national crisis
in mathematical education.",00:25:47.170,00:25:50.415
"Well, that's fair.",00:25:50.415,00:25:52.394
"If you could admit
your error, you",00:25:52.394,00:25:53.810
"will have contributed
constructively",00:25:53.810,00:25:55.310
"towards a solution of
a deplorable situation.",00:25:55.310,00:25:58.091
"Now, here's [INAUDIBLE].",00:25:58.091,00:25:59.090
"How many irate
mathematicians are needed",00:25:59.090,00:26:01.940
to get you to change your mind?,00:26:01.940,00:26:04.380
"Well that's proof by
intimidation, right?",00:26:04.380,00:26:07.794
[LAUGHTER],00:26:07.794,00:26:08.600

here's the reason why.",00:26:08.600,00:26:11.420

"it, they must, must be right.",00:26:13.490,00:26:16.510

after being corrected",00:26:17.550,00:26:19.340

mathematicians,",00:26:19.340,00:26:21.110

see your mistake.",00:26:21.110,00:26:23.300

mathematicians, that's",00:26:23.300,00:26:24.880

for correctness.",00:26:24.880,00:26:28.340

"Maybe women look at math
problems differently than men.",00:26:31.190,00:26:34.970
Ooh.,00:26:34.970,00:26:36.550
"Well, maybe it's a good
thing in this case.",00:26:36.550,00:26:39.220

look at the positive side.",00:26:51.550,00:26:54.230

were wrong, the country",00:26:54.230,00:26:56.840

very serious trouble.",00:26:56.840,00:26:58.620
All right.,00:27:01.481,00:27:01.980
"Now Marilyn writes an
even longer response",00:27:01.980,00:27:05.620

a nationwide experiment,",00:27:11.660,00:27:15.130

really wouldn't prove it either.",00:27:18.490,00:27:21.414
Then we go to the last page.,00:27:21.414,00:27:22.580

the controversy in the press.",00:27:23.630,00:27:27.420

came in and agreed with her.",00:27:41.870,00:27:47.260
OK.,00:27:47.260,00:27:48.490
"It turns out that Marilyn
was correct in her statement",00:27:48.490,00:27:52.650
that you should switch.,00:27:52.650,00:27:54.180
"And if you switch, you have
a 2/3 chance of winning.",00:27:54.180,00:27:57.630
"So if you don't switch, you've
got a 1/3 chance of winning,",00:27:57.630,00:28:01.050
"provided that
Monty is guaranteed",00:28:01.050,00:28:03.750
to open a door with goat.,00:28:03.750,00:28:05.285
"You know and that's
the assumption here.",00:28:05.285,00:28:07.780
And the proof is simple.,00:28:07.780,00:28:10.720
"Although Marilyn's reasoning
wasn't so convincing,",00:28:10.720,00:28:14.270
I didn't think.,00:28:14.270,00:28:15.590
"And all those PhDs that wrote
in with those stupid letters,",00:28:15.590,00:28:18.500
"they're probably
intelligent people.",00:28:18.500,00:28:20.220
"After all, they got advanced
degrees in mathematics,",00:28:20.220,00:28:22.480
"and most of them were
faculty teaching mathematics.",00:28:22.480,00:28:25.270
A little scary.,00:28:25.270,00:28:26.880
"But they just weren't
following the basic principles.",00:28:26.880,00:28:30.640
"They were following
their intuition.",00:28:30.640,00:28:32.600
"They didn't go through
the basic steps",00:28:32.600,00:28:34.220
to figure out the probability.,00:28:34.220,00:28:37.046
"So that's what
we're going to do.",00:28:37.046,00:28:38.420
"We're going to go
through the basic steps",00:28:38.420,00:28:39.602
now and see how to solve it.,00:28:39.602,00:28:41.140
"And we will use these
steps to solve pretty much",00:28:41.140,00:28:43.210
every problem in probability.,00:28:43.210,00:28:45.320
OK?,00:28:45.320,00:28:46.840
"So the key, the first step,
is to look at the sample",00:28:46.840,00:28:52.860
space of possible outcomes.,00:28:52.860,00:28:56.512
"Let me define sample
space and outcome.",00:28:56.512,00:28:58.710
"The sample space for an
experiment, or a probability",00:29:03.080,00:29:13.550
"game-- you can treat this Monty
Hall game as an experiment--",00:29:13.550,00:29:22.000
"is simply the set of
all possible outcomes,",00:29:22.000,00:29:28.990
things that could happen.,00:29:28.990,00:29:30.790
"In fact, let me
define an outcome,",00:29:33.750,00:29:36.660
"also known as an atomic
event or a sample point.",00:29:36.660,00:29:40.040
"An outcome, also
known as a sample",00:29:43.580,00:29:50.790
"point-- we'll use those
terms interchangeably--",00:29:50.790,00:29:59.470
"consists of all the information
about the experiment,",00:29:59.470,00:30:21.320
"including-- and
that's after it's",00:30:21.320,00:30:24.160
"been performed-- including the
values of all random choices.",00:30:24.160,00:30:42.940
"For example, say we want to
know the probability of winning",00:30:55.780,00:31:02.330
in Monty Hall if you switch.,00:31:02.330,00:31:05.486
"All right, let's
figure that out.",00:31:05.486,00:31:07.780
"So in that case, we're going to
define an outcome of the Monty",00:31:07.780,00:31:13.230
"Hall game or a sample point--
and I'm assuming in this case,",00:31:13.230,00:31:30.740
"we know you're going to switch
and the contestant switches--",00:31:30.740,00:31:47.434
consists of three things.,00:31:47.434,00:31:48.475
"First, the box with the prize,
where did Carroll put it?",00:31:52.710,00:32:00.780
"Second, the box chosen
by the contestant.",00:32:00.780,00:32:03.735
"And third, the box
that was revealed.",00:32:10.420,00:32:12.960
"Once you know
those three things,",00:32:18.160,00:32:19.720
"you know everything
about what happened.",00:32:19.720,00:32:23.150
All right?,00:32:23.150,00:32:24.880
"For example, let's look
at a typical sample point.",00:32:24.880,00:32:27.450
"Say I took sample point,
or outcome, 2,1,3.",00:32:30.330,00:32:40.330
"This is the outcome where
the prize is the box 2.",00:32:40.330,00:32:53.490
The player picks first box 1.,00:32:58.290,00:33:09.130
And Carol reveals box 3.,00:33:09.130,00:33:16.150
"OK, now in this case,
in this outcome,",00:33:19.600,00:33:22.140
did the contestant win?,00:33:22.140,00:33:23.205
"Yes, because we're
assuming-- for henceforth,",00:33:28.570,00:33:30.700
"for most of the rest
of the day, we're",00:33:30.700,00:33:31.550
"assuming the switch
case, because we're",00:33:31.550,00:33:33.230
going to analyze that.,00:33:33.230,00:33:34.360
"So that's fixed, they switch.",00:33:34.360,00:33:35.860
"They come in knowing
they're going to switch.",00:33:35.860,00:33:38.470
"So the prize is in 2, all right?",00:33:38.470,00:33:40.900
The prize is here.,00:33:40.900,00:33:41.650
The player started here.,00:33:44.590,00:33:46.560
Carol revealed 3.,00:33:46.560,00:33:48.770
"And when they switched,
they got the prize.",00:33:48.770,00:33:52.370
"So in this outcome,
the player won.",00:33:52.370,00:33:56.310
OK.,00:33:56.310,00:33:57.950
"Now, does every 3-tuple here
correspond to a sample point,",00:33:57.950,00:34:02.570
to our possible outcome?,00:34:02.570,00:34:05.601
No.,00:34:05.601,00:34:06.100
"What's an example of a sample
point with numbers 1, 2,",00:34:06.100,00:34:08.909
and 3 that's not.,00:34:08.909,00:34:09.980
Yeah?,00:34:12.489,00:34:12.989
Very good.,00:34:16.239,00:34:17.199
"Yeah, so for example, 1,
2, 1 is not a sample point,",00:34:17.199,00:34:27.010
"is not in the set,
the sample space,",00:34:27.010,00:34:31.500
"because we can't reveal
the box with the prize.",00:34:31.500,00:34:37.310
"Similarly, 2, 1, 1 is
not a sample point,",00:34:37.310,00:34:42.060
"because we can't reveal the
box that the player picked.",00:34:42.060,00:34:46.810
Yeah?,00:34:46.810,00:34:47.351
"AUDIENCE : I think the first two
pieces of data actually define",00:34:47.351,00:34:49.976
"the third one, because
once, or-- actually, no,",00:34:49.976,00:34:54.732
if they're the same.,00:34:54.732,00:34:57.210
"PROFESSOR: Right,
so if the player",00:34:57.210,00:34:59.490
"picked the box with
the prize, which",00:34:59.490,00:35:02.321
never happened in our case.,00:35:02.321,00:35:04.110
"For example, 1, 1 2 and
1, 1, 3 are both possible",00:35:04.110,00:35:12.460
"because you could put the prize
here, the player could pick it,",00:35:12.460,00:35:16.230
"now Carol has a choice
of revealing 2 or 3.",00:35:16.230,00:35:19.960
OK?,00:35:19.960,00:35:22.000
So these are OK.,00:35:22.000,00:35:22.790
"All right, so let's figure out
a nice way of characterizing",00:35:28.810,00:35:34.030
"all outcomes in
the sample space.",00:35:34.030,00:35:37.400
"Now, to do this, we're
going to set up a tree.",00:35:37.400,00:35:40.920
"And we're going to use
a thing called the tree",00:35:40.920,00:35:42.980
"method to construct
the sample space,",00:35:42.980,00:35:54.679
getting all the outcomes.,00:35:54.679,00:35:55.720
All right.,00:36:07.860,00:36:08.360
"So the first thing we do is
figure out where the prize is.",00:36:08.360,00:36:12.300
"And we'll represent that as
sort of like a decision tree.",00:36:17.060,00:36:19.980
There's three choices.,00:36:19.980,00:36:22.060
"It's in box 1, box 2, or box 3.",00:36:22.060,00:36:26.320
"Then the next thing is the
box that the player picked.",00:36:26.320,00:36:29.971
"And we'll continue our
decision tree here.",00:36:34.210,00:36:36.640
"Each of these now
has three branches.",00:36:36.640,00:36:39.200
"And they're labeled 1, 2, or 3.",00:36:43.910,00:36:45.778
"And then, the last step
is which box is revealed.",00:36:50.520,00:36:55.030
"Now, in this case, if
the prize is in one",00:37:00.190,00:37:03.620
"and the player chose one,
there's two possibilities.",00:37:03.620,00:37:08.680
We could reveal 2 or reveal 3.,00:37:08.680,00:37:12.090
"So we get 1, 2, 3
here and 1, 2, 3 here.",00:37:12.090,00:37:18.830
What about here?,00:37:18.830,00:37:20.880
"Prize is in box 1, box
2 is revealed-- sorry,",00:37:20.880,00:37:26.490
player picked box 2.,00:37:26.490,00:37:27.730
"Prize is in 1, player picks
2, how many choices for which",00:37:27.730,00:37:31.850
box is revealed?,00:37:31.850,00:37:34.940
One.,00:37:34.940,00:37:35.660
"And which box is
going to be revealed?",00:37:35.660,00:37:39.390
3.,00:37:39.390,00:37:41.870
"All right, this is
sample point 1, 2, 3.",00:37:41.870,00:37:44.900
"And here we've got 1,
3, 2 is the only choice.",00:37:44.900,00:37:50.120
All right.,00:37:53.150,00:37:54.660
"And let's do--
maybe I'll, we ought",00:37:54.660,00:37:56.625
"to fill the whole
thing out here.",00:37:56.625,00:37:58.140
"2, 1, 3-- I'm going to run out
of space, but-- 2, 2, now this",00:37:58.140,00:38:08.060
splits into 1 and 3.,00:38:08.060,00:38:13.110
All right?,00:38:13.110,00:38:13.790
"So we have here
2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3.",00:38:13.790,00:38:23.120
"Now let me do the last
one, 2, 3, 1 here.",00:38:23.120,00:38:26.420
"And now I'll bring
these up over here.",00:38:29.390,00:38:33.070
"I've got 3, 1, 2.",00:38:33.070,00:38:36.135
"Then I've got 3, 2, 1.",00:38:41.880,00:38:44.770
"And finally, I've got 3, 3
with two choices, 1 and 2.",00:38:48.210,00:38:53.780
All right?,00:38:59.650,00:39:00.150
"That is now the construction
of the entire sample space,",00:39:00.150,00:39:04.670

That's a win.,00:39:48.180,00:39:48.760
"The prize is here, the player
went there and switched,",00:39:48.760,00:39:51.560
so they wound up there.,00:39:51.560,00:39:53.520
Win.,00:39:53.520,00:39:55.390
"And these are all wins
for the same reason.",00:39:55.390,00:39:58.050

"2, 1, 1, the player got
it right to start with,",00:40:01.280,00:40:04.080
and then switched away.,00:40:04.080,00:40:05.170
That's a loss.,00:40:05.170,00:40:06.830

"Win, win, win.",00:40:08.470,00:40:12.320

right, they switched away,",00:40:12.320,00:40:14.955
it's a lose.,00:40:14.955,00:40:16.350

labeled every outcome",00:40:16.350,00:40:18.680
"as to whether the player
who's switching wins or loses.",00:40:18.680,00:40:23.420
"How many sample points

6.,00:40:27.940,00:40:29.780
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 out of 12.",00:40:29.780,00:40:34.590
Uh-oh.,00:40:34.590,00:40:36.420
Was Marilyn wrong?,00:40:36.420,00:40:37.290
Is it really Bobo was right?,00:40:37.290,00:40:38.590

"Half the sample points
lead to victory.",00:40:40.890,00:40:44.814
"Hm, what's missing here?",00:40:44.814,00:40:46.910
Yeah?,00:40:46.910,00:40:47.932
"AUDIENCE : The first
two are identical,",00:40:47.932,00:40:50.360
"the box with the prize
and the box chosen first.",00:40:50.360,00:40:52.360
"Each of those two sample
points coming from that",00:40:52.360,00:40:55.804
"are half as likely as
the single sample points.",00:40:55.804,00:40:59.876
PROFESSOR: That's right.,00:40:59.876,00:41:00.876
"What we're missing
here is the likelihood",00:41:00.876,00:41:04.060
"of an outcome, the probability
that this is what happens.",00:41:04.060,00:41:08.160
We're missing one more thing.,00:41:08.160,00:41:09.846
"And this is really
critical when you're",00:41:09.846,00:41:11.470
making your sample spaces.,00:41:11.470,00:41:13.630
"You need to make sure you get
the probabilities assigned",00:41:13.630,00:41:16.550
to each event.,00:41:16.550,00:41:17.180
"They're not necessarily
equally likely.",00:41:17.180,00:41:21.650
"In fact, what we need to do is
to construct the probability",00:41:21.650,00:41:25.060
space.,00:41:25.060,00:41:26.400
So lets define that.,00:41:26.400,00:41:27.440
"Your probability space consists
of a sample space-- which",00:41:33.870,00:41:44.300
we've already talked about.,00:41:44.300,00:41:46.670
"That's just all these outcomes--
and a probability function",00:41:46.670,00:42:02.140
"that maps-- and we call
this function, usually, PR.",00:42:02.140,00:42:06.460
"We'll have, sometimes it'll
be f or something like that--",00:42:06.460,00:42:11.500
"but PR maps the sample
space, S, to the real numbers",00:42:11.500,00:42:21.325
"such that first, for every
outcome in the sample space,",00:42:21.325,00:42:30.220
"the probability is between
0 and 1 of that outcome.",00:42:30.220,00:42:37.590
"And 2, if you sum
up the probabilities",00:42:37.590,00:42:40.570
"of all the outcomes, you get 1.",00:42:40.570,00:42:42.870
"So the sum over all outcomes of
the probability of the outcome",00:42:42.870,00:42:50.100
is 1.,00:42:50.100,00:42:52.541
All right?,00:42:52.541,00:42:53.040
"So the sample space
is all the outcomes.",00:42:53.040,00:42:55.750
"The probability space adds
in-- has this extra thing--",00:42:55.750,00:42:58.850
the probability of each outcome.,00:42:58.850,00:43:01.410
"And really, it
could be anything,",00:43:01.410,00:43:02.880
"as long is the probability
of every outcome",00:43:02.880,00:43:05.290
"is between 0 and 1 and
they all add up to 1.",00:43:05.290,00:43:09.140
That's it.,00:43:09.140,00:43:09.710
All right.,00:43:12.190,00:43:12.690
"Now, there's a
natural interpretation",00:43:12.690,00:43:15.550
"of what the probability
function is.",00:43:15.550,00:43:18.090
"And that is the probability
of a sample point,",00:43:18.090,00:43:20.812
"well, should be the
probability of its outcome.",00:43:20.812,00:43:22.770
"And this is sort of where you
get the to Marilyn saying,",00:43:28.967,00:43:31.300
"hey, try it a million times
and you'll see 2/3 of the time,",00:43:31.300,00:43:34.000
"roughly, you get the
right, that you win.",00:43:34.000,00:43:38.600
"So for every outcome,
the probability",00:43:38.600,00:43:42.990
"of that outcome,
that real number,",00:43:42.990,00:43:46.020
"should be the probability that
when you run the experiment,",00:43:46.020,00:43:54.000
w is what happens.,00:43:54.000,00:43:55.045
w will be the outcome.,00:43:59.270,00:44:00.580
"In other words, if
probability of w",00:44:07.090,00:44:08.690
"were a half, what
that means is you",00:44:08.690,00:44:12.620
"should get that half the
time, roughly speaking.",00:44:12.620,00:44:15.670
"We'll get into really
details of that later.",00:44:15.670,00:44:17.915
"In other words, you toss
a fair coin, you flip it.",00:44:17.915,00:44:20.810
"Well, you might say, a
probability half of a heads.",00:44:20.810,00:44:23.260
All right?,00:44:23.260,00:44:23.760
"And so, this function, then,
the probability of heads is 1/2.",00:44:23.760,00:44:28.620
"Now, assigning the right
probabilities to the outcomes",00:44:28.620,00:44:32.540
is 95% of the work.,00:44:32.540,00:44:36.029
"In fact, if you
screw that up, you're",00:44:36.029,00:44:37.570
"doomed because you can't
get the right answer.",00:44:37.570,00:44:40.517
"So for example, if we just
said, OK, each of these",00:44:40.517,00:44:42.600
"is probability 1/12,
we'd get Bobo's answer",00:44:42.600,00:44:46.571
as the probability of winning.,00:44:46.571,00:44:47.820
So that's not too good.,00:44:47.820,00:44:51.009
"Now, to get the right
probabilities for the Monty",00:44:51.009,00:44:53.050
"Hall problem, we have to
make some assumptions.",00:44:53.050,00:44:56.000
So let's write those down.,00:44:58.690,00:45:00.254
"So the first assumption
we're going to make",00:45:24.140,00:45:26.710
"is that Carol put the
prize in a random box.",00:45:26.710,00:45:30.170
They're all equally likely.,00:45:30.170,00:45:33.740
"So the prize is in each
box with probability 1/3.",00:45:33.740,00:45:44.470
"The next assumption
we're going to make",00:45:47.040,00:45:49.380
"is that the player didn't
see which box has the prize.",00:45:49.380,00:45:54.200
OK?,00:45:54.200,00:45:54.700
"In other words, and
more specifically,",00:45:54.700,00:45:58.110
"no matter where the
prize is, the player",00:45:58.110,00:46:08.350
"picks each box with
probability of 1/3.",00:46:08.350,00:46:11.380
"So the player's making,
effectively, a random choice.",00:46:11.380,00:46:13.735
"All right, and there's one more
assumption we're going to make.",00:46:27.449,00:46:30.482
"Anybody have any
ideas about what's",00:46:30.482,00:46:31.940
"left to make as an
assumption here?",00:46:31.940,00:46:34.786
Yeah?,00:46:34.786,00:46:35.286
"AUDIENCE : I guess, if
Carol's the one who's opening",00:46:37.724,00:46:39.890
"the boxes, she knows
where all the prizes are.",00:46:39.890,00:46:42.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:46:42.290,00:46:43.110
OK.,00:46:43.110,00:46:43.740
"So what assumption
should I make?",00:46:43.740,00:46:46.240
"Yeah, that she picks a box at
random if she has a choice.",00:46:50.980,00:46:55.077
"All right, so we're going
to make that assumption.",00:46:55.077,00:46:57.160
"So that no matter
where the prize",00:46:57.160,00:47:04.220
"is, if Carol has a
choice, she picks",00:47:04.220,00:47:19.740
each box with probability 1/2.,00:47:19.740,00:47:21.614
"Now, why is this
third one important?",00:47:35.960,00:47:38.430
Why might that really matter?,00:47:38.430,00:47:41.115
"Can anybody think of a reason
why that could be relevant?",00:47:41.115,00:47:43.490
"What if Carol had
some strategy in mind",00:47:46.358,00:47:50.182
that the contestant knew about?,00:47:50.182,00:47:52.572
"Can you think of why
that might be useful.",00:47:52.572,00:47:54.896
"AUDIENCE : If the contestant
were able to produce",00:47:54.896,00:47:57.794
"information based off of that,
then there's a higher chance",00:47:57.794,00:48:00.853
"a contestant could figure
out which one to choose.",00:48:00.853,00:48:03.107
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:48:03.107,00:48:04.073
"In fact, several years
ago, when I was lecturing,",00:48:04.073,00:48:09.010
"I said, in fact it
could make a difference.",00:48:09.010,00:48:11.770
"That there is a way that
Carol can convey information",00:48:11.770,00:48:14.220
"to the player by of two she's
choosing, which one to pick.",00:48:14.220,00:48:17.930
"Like, if she has a
choice of 2 or 3,",00:48:17.930,00:48:20.150
"say she always
picks bigger one, 3.",00:48:20.150,00:48:22.790
"Well, that might tell
you information about,",00:48:22.790,00:48:24.920
"she didn't pick 2, so
maybe it has to have,",00:48:24.920,00:48:27.370
"or she-- well, I don't know.",00:48:27.370,00:48:30.460
"In fact, that's
wrong, and it doesn't",00:48:30.460,00:48:32.970
"matter in the case of 2
boxes, this assumption.",00:48:32.970,00:48:35.239
"We're going to make
it, because we're going",00:48:35.239,00:48:37.030
to do the analysis with it.,00:48:37.030,00:48:38.900
"But for three boxes, you can
show that it really doesn't",00:48:38.900,00:48:41.640
matter for this assumption.,00:48:41.640,00:48:43.650
"But if you go to
four boxes, it does.",00:48:43.650,00:48:45.820
"And so in recitation
tomorrow, you're",00:48:45.820,00:48:47.510
"going to consider the four
box version of this game.",00:48:47.510,00:48:50.250
"And if Carol has a strategy
that the player knows about,",00:48:50.250,00:48:53.810
"you could improve the
player's chances of winning.",00:48:53.810,00:48:57.480
"But not for three, it turns out.",00:48:57.480,00:48:59.730
"In any case, when you're
setting up a problem,",00:48:59.730,00:49:02.690
"you've got to set
up your assumptions.",00:49:02.690,00:49:04.940
"Otherwise, you
don't get anywhere.",00:49:04.940,00:49:07.530
"These are sort of like
axioms, same kind of thing.",00:49:07.530,00:49:10.900
It's fine to make assumptions.,00:49:10.900,00:49:12.150
Just state what they are.,00:49:12.150,00:49:15.304
"Now, of course, you also
want them to be reasonable.",00:49:15.304,00:49:17.470
All right.,00:49:23.300,00:49:23.800
"So maybe we're going to
go back now and figure out",00:49:23.800,00:49:27.530
"how to get the
probabilities of the sample",00:49:27.530,00:49:31.100
"points, or the outcomes,
for Monty Hall.",00:49:31.100,00:49:34.690
Let's go do that.,00:49:34.690,00:49:36.762
"And maybe I'll draw them
in a different color here.",00:49:36.762,00:49:38.886
"What I'm going to do
is label every edge",00:49:43.280,00:49:45.790
"with a probability associated
with taking that step.",00:49:45.790,00:49:50.990
"So if the prize is placed in
each box with a probability",00:49:50.990,00:49:55.260
"of 1/3, that says this happens
with probability 1/3, that's",00:49:55.260,00:50:00.400
"1/3, and that's 1/3.",00:50:00.400,00:50:02.370
Same thing here.,00:50:05.000,00:50:06.570
"Assumption two says
that no matter where",00:50:06.570,00:50:09.410
"the prize is, say it's in box
1, the player chooses each box",00:50:09.410,00:50:14.820
with a probably of 1/3.,00:50:14.820,00:50:16.680
"So given that the
prize is in box 1,",00:50:16.680,00:50:19.110
"the player chooses 1 with
1/3, 2 with 1/3, 3 with 1/3.",00:50:19.110,00:50:24.330
Same if the prize is in box 2.,00:50:24.330,00:50:27.120
"So I label every edge
here with the probability.",00:50:27.120,00:50:29.120
All right.,00:50:31.780,00:50:34.800
Now I go to this level.,00:50:34.800,00:50:36.850
"And I'm, at this node, I'm
in the state where prize",00:50:36.850,00:50:40.248
"is in box 1, player
selected box 1,",00:50:40.248,00:50:43.960
"so Carol has a choice
of 2 or 3 to reveal.",00:50:43.960,00:50:48.420
"And she's going to reveal
each one with probability 1/2.",00:50:48.420,00:50:53.110
"So I label 1/2 on each
of these, because that's",00:50:53.110,00:50:55.250
what we've assumed.,00:50:55.250,00:50:57.980
"What probability do I
put on this edge here?",00:50:57.980,00:51:00.370
"Probability 1, because
there's no choice.",00:51:03.280,00:51:05.570
Carol has to do it.,00:51:05.570,00:51:07.020
The same here.,00:51:07.020,00:51:08.430
"And I get 1/2, 1/2,
1, 1, 1, 1/2, 1/2.",00:51:08.430,00:51:17.520
"All right, so I've labeled
every edge with its probability.",00:51:17.520,00:51:21.670
"Pretty simple, because
it was all assumed.",00:51:21.670,00:51:24.380
"Now I've got to get a
probability for each outcome.",00:51:24.380,00:51:27.196
"And we do that with
the following rule.",00:51:27.196,00:51:28.820
"The probability
of a sample point",00:51:36.480,00:51:49.680
"is the product of
the probabilities",00:51:49.680,00:52:08.210
"on the path leading
to the outcome,",00:52:08.210,00:52:10.250
"the path in the tree leading
to the outcome or the sample",00:52:10.250,00:52:24.675
point.,00:52:24.675,00:52:25.175
OK.,00:52:32.360,00:52:32.970
"So what this says is just
really, really simple.",00:52:32.970,00:52:38.080
"The probability of this sample
point is 1/3 times 1/3 times",00:52:38.080,00:52:43.410
"1/2, 1/18.",00:52:43.410,00:52:46.620
"The probability of this sample
point is 1/3 times 1/3 times",00:52:46.620,00:52:52.470
"1/2, 1/18.",00:52:52.470,00:52:55.489
"What's the probability of this
sample point going to be here?",00:52:55.489,00:52:58.030
1/9.,00:53:00.570,00:53:01.130
"I've got 1/3 times 1/3 times,
well, this g was 1, is 1/9.",00:53:01.130,00:53:06.200
"The next one here is 1/3
times 1/3 times 1, 1/9.",00:53:10.030,00:53:16.630
Same thing here.,00:53:16.630,00:53:18.310
1/3 times 1/3 times 1 is 1/9.,00:53:18.310,00:53:22.720
"Then I get 1/3 times
1/3 times 1/2 for 1/18.",00:53:22.720,00:53:27.920
And I can keep on going.,00:53:27.920,00:53:30.940
This would be 1/9.,00:53:30.940,00:53:32.970
"This one has a 1, so it's a 1/9.",00:53:32.970,00:53:35.400
An 1/18 and 1/18.,00:53:38.380,00:53:42.116
OK.,00:53:45.100,00:53:45.660
"Now, that's the rule.",00:53:45.660,00:53:46.840
And you'll always do this.,00:53:46.840,00:53:48.900
"You can sort of
see why it works.",00:53:48.900,00:53:51.680
"You'll understand
after another week why,",00:53:51.680,00:53:54.170
"for sure, why it works.",00:53:54.170,00:53:55.740
"But intuitively, you know,
to get to this outcome,",00:53:55.740,00:54:00.080
"these are the choices
we had to make.",00:54:00.080,00:54:02.170
"First, the box
had to be-- sorry,",00:54:02.170,00:54:04.820
the prize had to be in box 1.,00:54:04.820,00:54:06.760
"There's a one-in-three
chance of that happening.",00:54:06.760,00:54:09.220
"Now, in those
one-out-of-three chances,",00:54:09.220,00:54:13.190
"the chance the player
also picked box 1,",00:54:13.190,00:54:16.250
"1/3 of the time of 1/3
of the time that happens.",00:54:16.250,00:54:19.990
All right?,00:54:19.990,00:54:20.950
"1/3 of the time, you're here.",00:54:20.950,00:54:22.360
"And of that, 1/3 of those
times, you get to here.",00:54:22.360,00:54:26.200
"That's 1/3 times 1/3, or 1/9.",00:54:26.200,00:54:28.094
"And then, 1/2 of those times,
Carol happen to reveal box 2.",00:54:28.094,00:54:32.590
That's 1/18.,00:54:32.590,00:54:35.260
"So do you see why
that might make sense,",00:54:35.260,00:54:37.760
why you're multiplying these?,00:54:37.760,00:54:39.580
"Because at every step, you
have a chance to diverge.",00:54:39.580,00:54:42.400
"And the probability
you take the step",00:54:42.400,00:54:45.150
"that we're following
here-- say, in this case,",00:54:45.150,00:54:47.850
"it was 1/2-- that cuts down
the chance you land here",00:54:47.850,00:54:51.670
"by that probability, 1/2.",00:54:51.670,00:54:55.320
Any questions about that?,00:54:55.320,00:54:58.770
All right.,00:54:58.770,00:54:59.270
"For now, you can
take it on faith.",00:54:59.270,00:55:00.686
"We'll see why after we
do a few more of these",00:55:00.686,00:55:04.159
over the next week or so.,00:55:04.159,00:55:05.200
Any questions there?,00:55:07.760,00:55:09.280
Is that OK?,00:55:09.280,00:55:12.100
OK.,00:55:12.100,00:55:12.600
"Oh, yeah, all right?",00:55:12.600,00:55:14.487
AUDIENCE : [INAUDIBLE],00:55:14.487,00:55:15.425
PROFESSOR: On this one?,00:55:19.180,00:55:20.880
Only one choice.,00:55:20.880,00:55:22.160
"So it happens with
probability 1.",00:55:22.160,00:55:24.061
Any other questions?,00:55:27.067,00:55:27.900
OK.,00:55:31.459,00:55:32.860

"So now we can figure out
the probability of winning.",00:55:33.970,00:55:38.780
"Well, the probability of
winning is we have 1/9, 1/9,",00:55:38.780,00:55:42.790
"there's 3 of them,
4 of them, 5, 6.",00:55:42.790,00:55:46.801
All right?,00:55:46.801,00:55:47.300
"So the probability of
winning here is 6 times 1/9.",00:55:47.300,00:55:52.131
"Because you just sum up the
probabilities of the winning",00:56:16.190,00:56:18.730
sample points.,00:56:18.730,00:56:20.240
There's six of winning.,00:56:20.240,00:56:21.310
They're each 1/9.,00:56:21.310,00:56:23.230
And that's 2/3.,00:56:23.230,00:56:26.250
OK?,00:56:26.250,00:56:26.750
So Marilyn was right.,00:56:26.750,00:56:29.110
"There's a 2/3 chance of
winning if you switch.",00:56:29.110,00:56:31.660
"And now, this is
a formal argument",00:56:31.660,00:56:33.900
that gives you that answer.,00:56:33.900,00:56:35.630
"The nice thing is it works
for pretty much every problem",00:56:35.630,00:56:37.980
you ever think about.,00:56:37.980,00:56:39.880
"Now, in general,
if you want to know",00:56:39.880,00:56:41.430
"the probability
of any event, you",00:56:41.430,00:56:44.050
can follow this same method.,00:56:44.050,00:56:45.540
Let me define what an event is.,00:56:45.540,00:56:47.180
"An event is simply a
subset of outcomes,",00:56:53.085,00:56:58.880
a subset of the sample space.,00:56:58.880,00:57:00.136
"For example, we could
define the event of losing.",00:57:10.040,00:57:14.530
"Let's call EL, E sub-L, to be
the event that player loses,",00:57:14.530,00:57:20.840
"the player loses, with
the switch strategy.",00:57:20.840,00:57:26.950
All right?,00:57:35.390,00:57:35.890
"Now, to compute the
probability of an event,",00:57:35.890,00:57:38.110
"we just add the probabilities
of the outcomes in that set.",00:57:38.110,00:57:44.110
So let's get that down.,00:57:44.110,00:57:47.445
"All right, so formally,
the probability",00:58:05.840,00:58:19.577
"that an event occurs is simply
the sum, we'll call an event,",00:58:19.577,00:58:36.805
"e, let's say, event, e.",00:58:36.805,00:58:39.590
"It's a subset of
the sample space.",00:58:39.590,00:58:41.380
"The probability that
e occurs is the sum",00:58:41.380,00:58:44.710
"over the sample points in e of
the probability of those sample",00:58:44.710,00:58:49.920
points.,00:58:49.920,00:58:51.650
"So for example, the
probability of the event, EL,",00:58:51.650,00:58:56.280
"where the player
loses, well, there's",00:58:56.280,00:59:00.850
"six sample points
where the player loses,",00:59:00.850,00:59:03.129
each with the probability 1/18.,00:59:03.129,00:59:04.420
"So it's 1/3 is the probability
the player loses on the switch",00:59:07.760,00:59:12.040
strategy.,00:59:12.040,00:59:13.140
"And that's not surprising
because you either win",00:59:13.140,00:59:16.250
or you lose.,00:59:16.250,00:59:16.880
"The probabilities
have to add to 1.",00:59:16.880,00:59:18.970
"So if won with probability 2/3,
you lose with probability 1/3.",00:59:18.970,00:59:22.820
OK?,00:59:25.570,00:59:27.690
All right.,00:59:27.690,00:59:28.190
"So Marilyn was right,
much better to switch.",00:59:28.190,00:59:31.860
"We'll do a bunch more examples
with Monty Hall tomorrow.",00:59:31.860,00:59:34.810
"Are there any other questions
on Monty Hall before I change",00:59:34.810,00:59:39.630
gears?,00:59:39.630,00:59:40.590
Yeah?,00:59:40.590,00:59:42.572
"AUDIENCE: So you showed
that when you switch,",00:59:42.572,00:59:44.480
"you are more likely
to win than to lose.",00:59:44.480,00:59:47.705
"But you didn't show that
that's not also true",00:59:47.705,00:59:49.580
when you don't switch.,00:59:49.580,00:59:51.020
PROFESSOR: Ah good question.,00:59:51.020,00:59:52.409
"What happens if you're
playing the stay strategy.",00:59:52.409,00:59:54.450
"Right, maybe you win 2/3
of the time when you stay.",00:59:58.900,01:00:03.060
Maybe.,01:00:03.060,01:00:04.190
Maybe not.,01:00:04.190,01:00:05.590
Right?,01:00:05.590,01:00:06.090
"Because if I win
when I switch, what",01:00:06.090,01:00:12.994
"would have happened
if I'd stayed?",01:00:12.994,01:00:14.410
I'd have lost.,01:00:17.680,01:00:19.570
"Because if I win
when I switch, it",01:00:19.570,01:00:21.080
means the prize is over there.,01:00:21.080,01:00:22.380
"So if I stay, I'm going to lose.",01:00:22.380,01:00:24.990
"Which means that if I
do the stay strategy,",01:00:24.990,01:00:27.680
"I'm going to lose
2/3 of the time.",01:00:27.680,01:00:29.220
So you're right.,01:00:31.744,01:00:32.410
I didn't cover that.,01:00:32.410,01:00:33.750
But we can.,01:00:33.750,01:00:34.420
"It's not too hard in this
case because the probability",01:00:34.420,01:00:38.160
"of winning on a switch
equals the probability",01:00:38.160,01:00:41.540
of losing on a stick.,01:00:41.540,01:00:42.490
"So the probability that
you win with switch",01:00:45.760,01:00:52.280
"equals the probability you
lose with a stick strategy.",01:00:52.280,01:00:58.720
All right?,01:01:02.560,01:01:03.080
"And they're both 2/3,
because they're the same",01:01:03.080,01:01:06.080
and this is 2/3.,01:01:06.080,01:01:07.950
"So in fact, what's,
then, the chance",01:01:07.950,01:01:09.530
you win with a stick strategy?,01:01:09.530,01:01:10.780
1/3.,01:01:13.350,01:01:14.952
"And that's sort of you know,
where Marilyn was coming from.",01:01:14.952,01:01:17.410
"Because she said, well,
if you pick the box right",01:01:17.410,01:01:19.677
"the first time, which
is what you need",01:01:19.677,01:01:21.260
"to get to win with
a stick strategy,",01:01:21.260,01:01:23.870
"the chance you pick the
right box is one-in-three.",01:01:23.870,01:01:26.810
"And showing, you know, a
goat over here didn't matter.",01:01:26.810,01:01:29.060
It's still one-in-three.,01:01:29.060,01:01:32.200
"Now that's gets a--
that's intuition,",01:01:32.200,01:01:34.330
"but it can get you
trouble, because say",01:01:34.330,01:01:38.260
"you picked this box and Carol
showed you both of these boxes,",01:01:38.260,01:01:41.450
and they had pocket protectors.,01:01:41.450,01:01:43.519
"Then what do you know
about the probability",01:01:43.519,01:01:45.310
you won with a stick?,01:01:45.310,01:01:47.750
It's 1.,01:01:47.750,01:01:48.710
"Ooh, so things did change there.",01:01:48.710,01:01:50.900
All right?,01:01:50.900,01:01:51.400
"So you have to be a little
careful about how you reason,",01:01:51.400,01:01:54.375
OK?,01:01:54.375,01:01:55.740
You've got to do this.,01:01:55.740,01:01:58.300
"Stay with that and you'll always
be fine for your strategy.",01:01:58.300,01:02:03.630
"So really the key is to
resist the temptation",01:02:03.630,01:02:07.160
"to just sort of use your
intuition to think about it.",01:02:07.160,01:02:12.224
All right.,01:02:12.224,01:02:12.890
"Now, this is a pretty
simple example.",01:02:12.890,01:02:14.880
"So now I'm going
to do one that's",01:02:17.530,01:02:19.270
"a little more interesting and a
little more devious in a sense.",01:02:19.270,01:02:24.200
So I need a volunteer.,01:02:24.200,01:02:25.540
"We're going to do
a gambling game.",01:02:25.540,01:02:27.610
So I need a volunteer.,01:02:27.610,01:02:29.700
All right.,01:02:29.700,01:02:30.570
"Now, he's raised his
hands before I even",01:02:30.570,01:02:32.330
said what the criteria are.,01:02:32.330,01:02:34.690
"First, you gotta be confident
you understand probability.",01:02:34.690,01:02:37.065
"Well, you can fake it.",01:02:40.554,01:02:41.470
"But second, and more
importantly, you've",01:02:41.470,01:02:43.170
"got to have some money in
your product or you've got",01:02:43.170,01:02:46.200
to borrow some on the way down.,01:02:46.200,01:02:48.560
You got a few bucks there?,01:02:48.560,01:02:50.185
AUDIENCE: Yes.,01:02:50.185,01:02:50.769
"PROFESSOR: All
right, come on down.",01:02:50.769,01:02:52.226
"That's really all that
matters, you know.",01:02:52.226,01:02:54.115
"OK, now, in this game,
there's three dice.",01:03:03.735,01:03:08.370
"Well, that's 'cause
you're smart.",01:03:08.370,01:03:10.700
"OK, so let me show you
the dice in this game.",01:03:10.700,01:03:13.610
"And these, of course,
are not normal dice.",01:03:20.980,01:03:22.935
All right?,01:03:38.071,01:03:38.570
"So dice A has a 2, a
6, and a 7, and they're",01:03:38.570,01:03:43.980
the same on the reverse side.,01:03:43.980,01:03:45.390
"So it's a six-sided
die, and it's fair.",01:03:45.390,01:03:47.630
"When you roll it,
the probability A",01:03:47.630,01:03:49.990
comes up 2 is going to be 1/3.,01:03:49.990,01:03:51.970
All right?,01:03:51.970,01:03:52.490
Same for 6 and for 7.,01:03:52.490,01:03:55.640
"Ah, we're just getting started.",01:03:55.640,01:03:58.850
"Dice B has a 1, 5, and a 9 and
dice C has a 3, 4, and an 8.",01:03:58.850,01:04:07.552
"So I got-- they're
all different numbers,",01:04:07.552,01:04:09.260
the numbers from 1 to 9.,01:04:09.260,01:04:11.760
"So just so we're really
clear, the probability",01:04:11.760,01:04:15.190
that A comes up 3 is 1/3.,01:04:15.190,01:04:20.100
"The same for the probability
A comes up 6 is 1/3 and so on.",01:04:20.100,01:04:28.394
"Ah, yes I do mean 2.",01:04:28.394,01:04:30.405
Good.,01:04:30.405,01:04:31.110
"All right, good, you're
paying attention.",01:04:31.110,01:04:31.955
That's good.,01:04:31.955,01:04:32.480
There's some hope.,01:04:32.480,01:04:35.021
All right?,01:04:35.021,01:04:35.520
"Now, here's the game.",01:04:35.520,01:04:36.990
We're each going to pick a die.,01:04:36.990,01:04:38.610
And we're going to roll our die.,01:04:38.610,01:04:40.760
And the higher die wins.,01:04:40.760,01:04:41.890
We're going to roll them once.,01:04:41.890,01:04:43.140
The higher one wins.,01:04:43.140,01:04:44.600
"And the loser pays
the winner $1.",01:04:44.600,01:04:47.420
"And no tears, OK?",01:04:47.420,01:04:50.560
You got that?,01:04:50.560,01:04:51.250
That's good.,01:04:51.250,01:04:51.750
"He's already trying to
figure out which one to pick.",01:04:51.750,01:04:53.916
"So let's put your
dollar on the table.",01:04:53.916,01:04:57.290
Here we go.,01:04:57.290,01:04:59.064
AUDIENCE: I have a $5.,01:04:59.064,01:04:59.980
Do you have change?,01:04:59.980,01:05:01.260
PROFESSOR: I might have change.,01:05:01.260,01:05:03.460
All right.,01:05:03.460,01:05:04.150
Let's see here.,01:05:04.150,01:05:06.630
"Yes, I do have change.",01:05:06.630,01:05:07.750
"AUDIENCE: Oh, I
do have a dollar.",01:05:07.750,01:05:08.150
PROFESSOR: You have a dollar.,01:05:08.150,01:05:09.358
All right.,01:05:09.358,01:05:09.962
"Well, for now anyway.",01:05:09.962,01:05:11.020
"Let's put the dollar
there on the table.",01:05:11.020,01:05:14.707

to be a $20 next.",01:05:14.707,01:05:16.290

getting warmed up here.",01:05:16.290,01:05:18.165

your name, by the way?",01:05:18.165,01:05:20.207

PROFESSOR: Will.,01:05:20.831,01:05:21.660
"OK, nice to meet you, Will.",01:05:21.660,01:05:23.890
There we go.,01:05:23.890,01:05:24.790
All right.,01:05:24.790,01:05:25.290
"Now, there is one problem here.",01:05:25.290,01:05:27.830
I don't really have those dice.,01:05:27.830,01:05:30.595
"So we're going to have to
do a mathematical version",01:05:30.595,01:05:32.720
of this bet.,01:05:32.720,01:05:33.529
"AUDIENCE: You're always
going to win, then.",01:05:33.529,01:05:35.320
"PROFESSOR: So what
we're going to do",01:05:35.320,01:05:37.590
"is pretend that we did
a roll, head-to-head,",01:05:37.590,01:05:40.710
"and whichever one is
more likely to win,",01:05:40.710,01:05:43.770

came out that way, all right?",01:05:43.770,01:05:47.460
"Now, I know you've been
studying those three guys there,",01:05:47.460,01:05:51.330
those three dice.,01:05:51.330,01:05:53.070
"I'm going to be fair and let you
pick first which one you like.",01:05:53.070,01:05:56.620
"Now, as you look at
this, you know, you guys",01:05:56.620,01:06:00.910
"can help him out here if you
can figure out which one's best.",01:06:00.910,01:06:04.140
"This has got a couple
good sized numbers.",01:06:04.140,01:06:06.540
"You know, two of
these beat these.",01:06:06.540,01:06:08.610
"This has the biggest number,
but it also has the smallest.",01:06:08.610,01:06:11.600
This has two small guys in it.,01:06:11.600,01:06:14.960
"You now and you want to pick
the one that's likely to--",01:06:14.960,01:06:17.427
"AUDIENCE: They all add
up to the same thing.",01:06:17.427,01:06:19.260

to the same thing, that's true.",01:06:19.260,01:06:21.920
Yeah.,01:06:21.920,01:06:22.420
Which one do you want?,01:06:25.054,01:06:25.970
Which one do you want here Will?,01:06:38.606,01:06:40.070
What's your best one there?,01:06:42.529,01:06:43.654
A does look pretty good.,01:06:47.610,01:06:49.418
"You've got two
solid numbers there.",01:06:49.418,01:06:52.286
It does.,01:06:52.286,01:06:53.242
"A looks like it beats
up on C pretty good.",01:06:53.242,01:06:57.560

to lose a dollar.",01:06:59.060,01:07:00.554

[LAUGHTER],01:07:02.045,01:07:03.533
[AUDIENCE CHATTER],01:07:04.033,01:07:05.524
I don't know.,01:07:14.967,01:07:15.509
A looks pretty good to us.,01:07:15.509,01:07:16.591
Which one do you like here?,01:07:16.591,01:07:17.773
We'll try them out.,01:07:17.773,01:07:19.192
We'll play more games here.,01:07:19.192,01:07:21.560
"A. All right, Will
likes A. All right.",01:07:21.560,01:07:29.134
"And I'm going to
pick-- I'm going",01:07:29.134,01:07:32.169
"to go with C. I'm going to give
you a fighting chance, right?",01:07:32.169,01:07:34.710
"Because we figured A
beat C for sure, right?",01:07:34.710,01:07:37.190
"Because you've got a couple
of 6 and 7 beat up 3 and 4",01:07:37.190,01:07:39.450
pretty good.,01:07:39.450,01:07:41.050
"Yeah, I'm going to
pick C. All right.",01:07:41.050,01:07:44.597
"And now we're going to
do-- figure out which",01:07:44.597,01:07:46.430
one's more likely to win.,01:07:46.430,01:07:49.050
"And we're going to
make the tree diagram.",01:07:49.050,01:07:51.411
All right?,01:07:51.411,01:07:51.910
"So here's A. You've got 2,
6, and 7 are your choices.",01:07:51.910,01:07:58.265
And they're each 1/3.,01:07:58.265,01:07:59.140
"And then, for mine,
I've got 3, 4, and 8.",01:08:01.930,01:08:05.311
"3, 4, and 8.",01:08:10.720,01:08:13.590
"3, 4, and 8.",01:08:13.590,01:08:15.130
And they're all 1/3 chance.,01:08:15.130,01:08:16.475
"All right, so I
make my tree here.",01:08:19.925,01:08:23.430
"I got squished at the
bottom, but they're all 1/3.",01:08:23.430,01:08:28.495
"All right, now we're
going to see who wins,",01:08:28.495,01:08:30.939
C or A. There's nine outcomes.,01:08:30.939,01:08:34.640
Who wins this outcome?,01:08:34.640,01:08:38.034
"Oh, I do.",01:08:38.034,01:08:38.740
"Yeah, I get all these.",01:08:38.740,01:08:40.584
That's good.,01:08:40.584,01:08:41.380
You're in trouble already.,01:08:41.380,01:08:42.600
"What happens here, though?",01:08:42.600,01:08:43.957
Who wins that?,01:08:43.957,01:08:44.540
"Your 6 beats 3, 6 beats 4.",01:08:48.279,01:08:50.010
You win those.,01:08:50.010,01:08:51.240
I got you here.,01:08:51.240,01:08:53.609
Then you win 7 beats 3.,01:08:53.609,01:08:56.210
A wins.,01:08:56.210,01:08:57.350
"7 beats 4, A wins.",01:08:57.350,01:08:59.149
"It's tied, but, oh,
my 8 beat your 7.",01:08:59.149,01:09:01.370
All right.,01:09:03.950,01:09:04.609
So let's see here.,01:09:04.609,01:09:07.939
"There's one, two, three, four,
five for me, each at 1/9.",01:09:07.939,01:09:14.000
"All right, so I'm going to win.",01:09:14.000,01:09:18.583
All right?,01:09:18.583,01:09:20.180
"Now, in this case, the
sample space is uniform.",01:09:20.180,01:09:24.510
"Every probability is the
same for the outcomes.",01:09:24.510,01:09:27.140
They're all 1/9.,01:09:27.140,01:09:28.950
1/3 times 1/3.,01:09:28.950,01:09:29.700
1/3 times 1/3.,01:09:29.700,01:09:31.240
All right?,01:09:31.240,01:09:31.740
"So that's the case where we say
the sample space is uniform.",01:09:31.740,01:09:36.090
Don't go anywhere.,01:09:36.090,01:09:36.960
"We're going to do
some more here.",01:09:36.960,01:09:39.160
"The sample space is uniform
if every sample point",01:09:42.180,01:09:53.689
has the same probability.,01:09:53.689,01:09:54.730
"In which case, the probability
of the sample points",01:10:01.880,01:10:05.350
"would be 1 in the cardinality
of the sample space.",01:10:05.350,01:10:08.760
"In this case,
there's nine points.",01:10:08.760,01:10:10.320
They each have probability 1/9.,01:10:10.320,01:10:13.270
"And in this case, C beats
A with probability of 5/9.",01:10:13.270,01:10:21.190
That means I win the dollar.,01:10:23.970,01:10:27.070
All right.,01:10:27.070,01:10:29.058
"So do you have some
more money in there?",01:10:29.058,01:10:32.274
In that wallet?,01:10:32.274,01:10:33.300
I'll make change for you.,01:10:33.300,01:10:35.170
"So, what we're going
to do is play again.",01:10:35.170,01:10:38.220
"And you've learned something
now, that C beats A.",01:10:38.220,01:10:40.910
"So we play again,
you're probably",01:10:40.910,01:10:42.750
"not going to want
to pick A. In fact,",01:10:42.750,01:10:46.070
C is surprisingly good there.,01:10:46.070,01:10:49.050
"Now, I'll let you
wager more, if you",01:10:49.050,01:10:50.550
"want, to win your dollar back.",01:10:50.550,01:10:51.800
"Do you want to do
double or nothing?",01:10:51.800,01:10:53.845
[LAUGHTER],01:10:53.845,01:10:55.745
"AUDIENCE: So you always
get to pick second, though?",01:10:59.335,01:11:02.184
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,01:11:02.184,01:11:02.850
I've got to be fair here.,01:11:02.850,01:11:04.092
I'm going to let you pick first.,01:11:04.092,01:11:05.425
[LAUGHTER],01:11:05.425,01:11:07.470
"All right, you got
a couple bucks?",01:11:07.470,01:11:09.866
We'll do double or nothing.,01:11:09.866,01:11:10.990
What do you say?,01:11:10.990,01:11:11.656
I'll make change for you.,01:11:11.656,01:11:13.270
There you go.,01:11:13.270,01:11:14.690
Here's $5.,01:11:14.690,01:11:15.565
I'll change your $5.,01:11:15.565,01:11:17.220
And then we'll bet $2.,01:11:17.220,01:11:18.270
How's that?,01:11:18.270,01:11:19.390
"I've actually got
a $2 bill here.",01:11:19.390,01:11:23.166
There we go.,01:11:23.166,01:11:23.780
You've got $2.,01:11:23.780,01:11:24.440
There we go.,01:11:24.440,01:11:25.640
"All right, double or nothing.",01:11:25.640,01:11:28.560
"Will, what do you like?",01:11:28.560,01:11:29.924
"You're obviously
not going to pick",01:11:29.924,01:11:31.340
"A. That just got beat by C.
What do you like, B or C?",01:11:31.340,01:11:34.245
"Well, one of them's
got to be best.",01:11:42.724,01:11:44.801
"One of them's got
to be best here.",01:11:44.801,01:11:46.217
"You've just got to figure
out which one it is.",01:11:46.217,01:11:48.712
"AUDIENCE: I feel like everyone's
going to have [INAUDIBLE].",01:11:48.712,01:11:51.970
"If I choose C, let me see.",01:11:51.970,01:11:54.500
"That would be
[INAUDIBLE] so I guess.",01:11:54.500,01:11:58.610
"PROFESSOR: I won't pick
A, that's for sure.",01:11:58.610,01:12:00.604
"AUDIENCE: If you pick
B, I get one from 4,",01:12:00.604,01:12:02.354
"I get two from the
8, which is four.",01:12:02.354,01:12:03.854
And you get the other five.,01:12:03.854,01:12:05.318
"If I pick C and you pick A,
that means I get one from the 3,",01:12:05.318,01:12:09.270
I get one from the 4.,01:12:09.270,01:12:11.246
"If I get two from the
8, you still get 5.",01:12:11.246,01:12:14.704
PROFESSOR: That's good.,01:12:14.704,01:12:16.186
"You've figured out
you're screwed here.",01:12:16.186,01:12:19.644
That's very good.,01:12:19.644,01:12:20.650
All right.,01:12:20.650,01:12:21.980
"So, yeah, so he's sort
of-- he's doing great.",01:12:21.980,01:12:24.120
"He's figured out, because
he went through this sort",01:12:24.120,01:12:26.245
"of like this method, what all
the possible outcomes were.",01:12:26.245,01:12:28.800
"And he's discovered that,
no matter what he picks,",01:12:28.800,01:12:31.680
I'm going to beat him.,01:12:31.680,01:12:33.830
"So let's see why
that's the case.",01:12:33.830,01:12:35.340
So let's see.,01:12:35.340,01:12:36.440
"So because you figured it
out, I won't take your money",01:12:36.440,01:12:39.130
this time.,01:12:39.130,01:12:39.990
"But we'll do some
more in a minute.",01:12:39.990,01:12:41.770
"So say Will picked--
say he picked C.",01:12:41.770,01:12:46.900
"And say that then I
will pick B. All right,",01:12:46.900,01:12:52.000
"so on C, there's three choices.",01:12:52.000,01:12:55.220
3.,01:12:55.220,01:12:55.830
"4, and 8.",01:12:55.830,01:12:57.480
"And then, on my choice of
B, there's 1, 5, and 9.",01:12:57.480,01:13:01.775
"All right, so I get 1, 5, and 9.",01:13:06.160,01:13:09.120
"And now we can
see who wins here.",01:13:09.120,01:13:12.070
"Well, C wins there,
loses here, loses there.",01:13:12.070,01:13:17.810
"C wins here, and B
wins the next two.",01:13:17.810,01:13:22.370
And C wins these.,01:13:22.370,01:13:24.000
And B wins the tiebreaker.,01:13:24.000,01:13:26.650
"So B beats C with
probability 5/9.",01:13:26.650,01:13:30.280
All right.,01:13:38.420,01:13:38.920
"So you don't want to pick
A, you don't want to pick C,",01:13:38.920,01:13:43.650
you want to try a bet with B?,01:13:43.650,01:13:45.094
"I mean, look, you've got B
beats C. We just showed that.",01:13:48.363,01:13:52.840
"C beats A. I mean, that's a
sure bet if I ever saw one.",01:13:52.840,01:13:57.847
[LAUGHTER],01:13:57.847,01:13:59.284
PROFESSOR: What do you think?,01:13:59.284,01:14:01.200
"AUDIENCE: So if I pick B and you
pick C, that means [INAUDIBLE]",01:14:01.200,01:14:06.268
[AUDIENCE CHATTER],01:14:09.220,01:14:12.172
"But if he picks A, then
I get [INAUDIBLE] Yeah,",01:14:12.172,01:14:22.012
"I'd still get 4, so--",01:14:22.012,01:14:24.010
"PROFESSOR: So if you pick
B, what am I going to do?",01:14:24.010,01:14:26.752
"AUDIENCE: Oh, you're
going to pick A.",01:14:26.752,01:14:28.499
"PROFESSOR: I'm going to pick A.
Let's see how that works out.",01:14:28.499,01:14:31.040
"All right, so B has 1, 5, and 9.",01:14:31.040,01:14:36.850
"A is, yeah, 2, 6, and 7.",01:14:36.850,01:14:40.685
"OK, so you're going to
lose all three there.",01:14:46.780,01:14:50.670
A wins those.,01:14:50.670,01:14:53.320
"A wins-- no, you win.",01:14:53.320,01:14:56.950
"B wins there, but A
wins the next couple.",01:14:56.950,01:15:00.967
"And then, you win
the last three.",01:15:00.967,01:15:02.341
"So A wins, again,
5/9 of the time.",01:15:05.500,01:15:13.090
So how is this possible?,01:15:13.090,01:15:15.880
"We've got A beats B,
beats C, beats A. All 5/9.",01:15:15.880,01:15:26.040
How is that possible?,01:15:26.040,01:15:27.885
Did we make a mistake?,01:15:27.885,01:15:29.250
"Well, why isn't it possible?",01:15:32.440,01:15:35.610
"Whoever said probabilities
were transitive?",01:15:35.610,01:15:40.050
Right?,01:15:40.050,01:15:40.912
"I mean, you'd sort
of think there's",01:15:40.912,01:15:42.370
a best of the three die.,01:15:42.370,01:15:44.260
"But for any one that
you pick, that he picks,",01:15:44.260,01:15:46.220
I can find one that's better.,01:15:46.220,01:15:47.428
And it goes in a cycle.,01:15:47.428,01:15:49.630
All right?,01:15:49.630,01:15:50.130
"So you'd think picking
first, you've got a shot",01:15:50.130,01:15:52.820
to pick the best one.,01:15:52.820,01:15:53.780
"But picking second
always wins this game,",01:15:53.780,01:15:56.890
if you pick the right one.,01:15:56.890,01:15:59.411
All right.,01:15:59.411,01:15:59.910
"You know, since you did
good and figured that out,",01:15:59.910,01:16:02.280
"I'm going to give you a
special opportunity here.",01:16:02.280,01:16:05.850
All right?,01:16:05.850,01:16:06.350
"Now, I'm going to
let you go second.",01:16:06.350,01:16:11.540
All right?,01:16:11.540,01:16:13.030
"So I'm going to
pick one, and I'm",01:16:13.030,01:16:15.740
going to let you pick after me.,01:16:15.740,01:16:17.360
And then we're going to bet.,01:16:17.360,01:16:19.480
"There's going to be
a little twist to it.",01:16:19.480,01:16:22.812
"But you want to
pick second, right?",01:16:22.812,01:16:24.270
"All right, well, let me tell
you what I'm going to do.",01:16:28.235,01:16:30.485
"Just to make it-- I want
to do a different analysis.",01:16:30.485,01:16:32.030
"We already did these three,
so what I'm going to do",01:16:32.030,01:16:34.155
"is an analysis where
we roll them twice.",01:16:34.155,01:16:37.289
"Otherwise, it's the
same basic thing,",01:16:37.289,01:16:38.830
"but I want to do an analysis
with more outcomes here.",01:16:38.830,01:16:41.510
"We've sort of beat
this one to death.",01:16:41.510,01:16:43.310
So I'm going to go first.,01:16:43.310,01:16:45.210
"And let's see, what
do I want to pick?",01:16:45.210,01:16:52.860
Hm.,01:16:52.860,01:16:54.520
"Well, what should I pick,
if I'm going to do this?",01:16:54.520,01:16:56.720
"I guess I'll pick B, all right?",01:16:56.720,01:17:01.330
So I'm going to pick B here.,01:17:01.330,01:17:03.190
All right.,01:17:06.940,01:17:07.440
"How much do you
want to bet here?",01:17:07.440,01:17:07.970
"I'm going to let you
win your money back.",01:17:07.970,01:17:09.678
I'll let you bet up to $10.,01:17:09.678,01:17:11.630
Your choice.,01:17:11.630,01:17:12.245
"What do you-- what do
you want to bet here?",01:17:15.179,01:17:16.970
"We've got to put some
money on the table,",01:17:16.970,01:17:18.280
make it a little interesting.,01:17:18.280,01:17:19.488
"Yeah, you pick--",01:17:22.190,01:17:23.314
"AUDIENCE: Do you roll a
different die or what?",01:17:23.314,01:17:25.230
"PROFESSOR: No, the same ones.",01:17:25.230,01:17:26.438
The die don't change.,01:17:26.438,01:17:27.680
"I'm picking B. And I'm going
to roll it a couple times.",01:17:27.680,01:17:31.220
"And I'm going to
add up my score.",01:17:31.220,01:17:32.700
"And then, you get to pick
whatever die you want.",01:17:32.700,01:17:34.700
I'm going to let you pick.,01:17:34.700,01:17:35.783
"I mean, I'm going to let you
pick the one that beats it.",01:17:35.783,01:17:39.770
You roll yours a couple times.,01:17:39.770,01:17:41.620
"And now we see which
one has the higher",01:17:41.620,01:17:43.310
"sum, who's more likely to win.",01:17:43.310,01:17:45.393
"AUDIENCE: So it's the sum
total, like you roll a 9 and 9",01:17:45.393,01:17:47.726
and I roll a 7 and 7.,01:17:47.726,01:17:48.777
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, then I'm
going to win, because I get 18",01:17:48.777,01:17:51.110
and you got 14.,01:17:51.110,01:17:52.090
"If I roll a 9 and
a 1, I get a 10.",01:17:52.090,01:17:54.270
"You roll a 6 and a
7, you beat me at 13.",01:17:54.270,01:17:56.884
All right?,01:17:56.884,01:17:58.360
"So which one do
you want to pick?",01:17:58.360,01:18:02.490
"You could pick C. But you've got
to put the money on the table",01:18:02.490,01:18:05.740
"here, whatever you want to bet.",01:18:05.740,01:18:08.739
"You know, I want to give you a
chance to win your money back.",01:18:08.739,01:18:11.280
"What's the probability
he's going to lose?",01:18:14.830,01:18:18.032
[LAUGHTER],01:18:18.032,01:18:19.514
You got a T-Card?,01:18:19.514,01:18:20.449
What've you got in there?,01:18:20.449,01:18:21.490
"Ah, I'll take the
[INAUDIBLE] card.",01:18:21.490,01:18:23.512
What's that worth?,01:18:23.512,01:18:24.985
"Ah, it's worth a few bucks here.",01:18:24.985,01:18:27.931
"All right, so I'm picking
B. Which are you picking?",01:18:27.931,01:18:33.390
"I've really got his
head messed up now.",01:18:37.110,01:18:40.304
"AUDIENCE: There's
$4 on the table.",01:18:40.304,01:18:41.720
Take that and run.,01:18:41.720,01:18:43.690
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, really.",01:18:43.690,01:18:44.690
"We already saw-- I'll
give you a hint here.",01:18:44.690,01:18:46.570
"A beats B. 5/9 of the time,
A comes up higher than B.",01:18:46.570,01:18:50.860
"So if we roll them
twice, your odds",01:18:50.860,01:18:54.030
"got even better that
A beats B. All right,",01:18:54.030,01:18:59.420
"so Will goes with A. Will,
that was a big mistake.",01:18:59.420,01:19:03.850
All right.,01:19:03.850,01:19:05.020
How can it be a mistake?,01:19:05.020,01:19:06.020
A beats B 5/9 of the time.,01:19:06.020,01:19:09.220
"Now what we're going to do
is make the decision tree.",01:19:09.220,01:19:12.220
"If we roll B twice,
if we roll A twice.",01:19:12.220,01:19:15.351
All right.,01:19:15.351,01:19:15.850
Let's see what happens.,01:19:15.850,01:19:17.530
"This is a nasty
one to write down.",01:19:17.530,01:19:19.090
"In fact, you'll start
seeing this when you",01:19:19.090,01:19:20.840
do these tree method things.,01:19:20.840,01:19:22.100
"Sometimes the trees
get a little hairy,",01:19:22.100,01:19:23.725
"so we've got to sort of
approximate it a little bit.",01:19:23.725,01:19:27.520
"So here's B, right?",01:19:27.520,01:19:30.140
"I got 1, 5, and 9
for my first roll.",01:19:30.140,01:19:33.950
"And then I got 1, 5, and
9 for my second roll.",01:19:33.950,01:19:36.430
And I add these up.,01:19:42.100,01:19:44.590
"See, if you read the notes
ahead, sometimes that helps.",01:19:44.590,01:19:47.990
6-- here are my outcomes.,01:19:47.990,01:19:49.495
"These are the numbers
I'm going to get.",01:19:49.495,01:19:51.120
These are my nine values.,01:19:54.300,01:19:57.000
"Your nine values,
you got 2, 6, and 7.",01:19:57.000,01:20:01.360
"Then each 2, 6, and 7 again.",01:20:01.360,01:20:05.170
"So we add those up, you got 4,
8, 9, 8, 12, 13, 9, 13, and 14.",01:20:05.170,01:20:15.165
"And now, we have
each one of these",01:20:15.165,01:20:17.290
against each one of these.,01:20:17.290,01:20:19.130
Because there's 81 outcomes.,01:20:19.130,01:20:20.830
I got four levels to the tree.,01:20:20.830,01:20:22.230
"And rather than draw four
levels of this [INAUDIBLE] tree",01:20:22.230,01:20:25.370
"to get 81 outcomes,
you're going to say",01:20:25.370,01:20:27.250
"that each one of
these corresponds",01:20:27.250,01:20:30.280
"to this tree, all right,
that has nine leaves.",01:20:30.280,01:20:34.330
"And now we can just count
up how many times I win.",01:20:34.330,01:20:40.205
"Well, 2 got nothing.",01:20:40.205,01:20:41.630
That's a 0.,01:20:41.630,01:20:44.270
Let's see how many times 6 wins.,01:20:44.270,01:20:46.120
One-- one time.,01:20:46.120,01:20:50.064
"10-- one, two,
three, four, five.",01:20:50.064,01:20:53.210
"All right, we've got that.",01:20:55.890,01:20:57.050
"6 wins, we already
decided, once.",01:20:57.050,01:21:01.260
"10, we decided already,
wins five times.",01:21:01.260,01:21:06.630
"14 wins one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,",01:21:06.630,01:21:09.612
"eight, and ties once.",01:21:09.612,01:21:12.290
Tie-- one.,01:21:12.290,01:21:15.390
"10, we already got was five.",01:21:15.390,01:21:18.550
"14, we already got,
was eight and a tie.",01:21:18.550,01:21:23.260
"And finally, I get
18 wins every time.",01:21:23.260,01:21:28.000
Let's add this up.,01:21:28.000,01:21:28.780
"I got 17, 22, 30,
35, 36, 41, 42 times",01:21:28.780,01:21:36.210
plus half the ties out of 81.,01:21:36.210,01:21:42.370
"How much money's on
this [INAUDIBLE] card?",01:21:42.370,01:21:44.120
"Ah, smart guy.",01:21:49.224,01:21:50.440
How did this happen?,01:21:53.919,01:21:55.410
"A is more likely to
beat B, higher than B.",01:21:55.410,01:21:58.550
"But you roll them
twice, and it's",01:21:58.550,01:22:00.160
"less likely to be
as large on the sum?",01:22:00.160,01:22:03.770
"Well, why not?",01:22:03.770,01:22:05.020
"It's just our intuition's
all screwed up.",01:22:05.020,01:22:07.760
But the math is straightforward.,01:22:07.760,01:22:10.160
"In fact, an amazing
thing happens.",01:22:10.160,01:22:12.410
"If you roll them twice,
they reverse completely.",01:22:12.410,01:22:17.710
"A is worse than B, is worse
than C, is worse than A",01:22:17.710,01:22:22.590
if you roll them twice.,01:22:22.590,01:22:24.150
"If you roll them three times,
something else happens.",01:22:24.150,01:22:27.570
"In fact, it was known
for a long time,",01:22:27.570,01:22:29.540
"this phenomenon
happens with one roll.",01:22:29.540,01:22:31.665
"And when I was making lecture
notes a few years ago,",01:22:31.665,01:22:34.070
"I noticed they reverse
with two rolls.",01:22:34.070,01:22:35.869
"And then we did a class
project to discover",01:22:35.869,01:22:37.660
what happens with k rolls.,01:22:37.660,01:22:39.830
"And it turns out that you can
get every possible combination.",01:22:39.830,01:22:44.034
"You know, on some
number of rolls,",01:22:44.034,01:22:45.450
"A beats both B and C and B
beats C. Other number of rolls,",01:22:45.450,01:22:50.230
A beats them both and C beats B.,01:22:50.230,01:22:53.010
"And then, motivated by
that, some researchers",01:22:53.010,01:22:55.600
"out in San Diego showed
that there's arbitrarily",01:22:55.600,01:22:59.330
"strange dice, now, not
with just three sides,",01:22:59.330,01:23:03.600
but with more sides.,01:23:03.600,01:23:05.830
"Such that, for any tournaments--
remember a tournament",01:23:05.830,01:23:09.025
"from graph theory,
where everybody beats,",01:23:09.025,01:23:11.410
"you know, between a pair of
players, one player wins.",01:23:11.410,01:23:14.580
"You can make the relation
for any tournament",01:23:14.580,01:23:18.130
"show up for a
particular set of dice",01:23:18.130,01:23:20.110
"by rolling a certain
number of times.",01:23:20.110,01:23:22.489
"All right, which is
just really fascinating",01:23:22.489,01:23:24.280
that you can prove that.,01:23:24.280,01:23:25.280
"So these dice can
get arbitrarily weird",01:23:25.280,01:23:27.660
"in terms of which die is
likely to come up and be",01:23:27.660,01:23:30.900
better than another die.,01:23:30.900,01:23:32.989
"All right, that's it for today.",01:23:32.989,01:23:34.280
"Let me give you your
money back here.",01:23:34.280,01:23:35.430
"And I've got a gift
certificate you can",01:23:35.430,01:23:37.055
have for being a good sport.,01:23:37.055,01:23:40.170
Here you go.,01:23:40.170,01:23:40.670
How much money did I take here?,01:23:40.670,01:23:42.160
AUDIENCE: I think only like $2.,01:23:42.160,01:23:43.697
PROFESSOR: $2?,01:23:43.697,01:23:44.280
"All right, there you go.",01:23:44.280,01:23:45.620
Very good.,01:23:45.620,01:23:46.270
Thanks.,01:23:46.270,01:23:46.770
"So we'll do a lot more examples
over the next week or two.",01:23:49.480,01:23:53.140
