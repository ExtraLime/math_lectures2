"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: All, right welcome back.",00:00:11.470,00:00:12.764
This is CS50.,00:00:12.764,00:00:14.140
And this is the start of week nine.,00:00:14.140,00:00:16.800
"And this is the start of the rest of
your time in CS50, in which we",00:00:16.800,00:00:19.960
"transition now, finally, to the web
aspect of the course, where you'll",00:00:19.960,00:00:23.170
"find that a lot of the fundamentals that
we've been exporting for weeks",00:00:23.170,00:00:26.200
"still come back to visit,
or haunt, us.",00:00:26.200,00:00:29.270
"But now, you'll find that it's an
order of magnitude easier to",00:00:29.270,00:00:33.440
"accomplish certain tasks and
solve certain problems--",00:00:33.440,00:00:36.540
"so much so that even if you thought
certain problem sets were fun in their",00:00:36.540,00:00:41.050
"own way, I think that you'll find
that p set 7, p set 8, and then,",00:00:41.050,00:00:44.200
"ultimately, the final project will be
all the more gratifying because you'll",00:00:44.200,00:00:47.990
"find that we begin to take for granted
now things like memory management, and",00:00:47.990,00:00:51.830
"pointers, and what's going
on underneath the hood.",00:00:51.830,00:00:54.190
"And again, thematic, all throughout the
semester has been this layering",00:00:54.190,00:00:57.310
and layering.,00:00:57.310,00:00:58.030
"And now we're sort of up
here, standing on the",00:00:58.030,00:01:00.530
shoulders of weeks past.,00:01:00.530,00:01:01.930
"&gt;&gt; Now, recall from last time that we
talked about how the internet worked.",00:01:01.930,00:01:05.360
"And this was perhaps an
oversimplification, but remember that",00:01:05.360,00:01:08.120
"every computer in the world has an IP
address, although that's a bit of an",00:01:08.120,00:01:12.960
oversimplification still.,00:01:12.960,00:01:14.570
"And those addresses are used to uniquely
identify machines so that",00:01:14.570,00:01:18.180
"when you send information, or packets,
so to speak, they can have an origin",00:01:18.180,00:01:22.010
address and a destination address.,00:01:22.010,00:01:24.000
"And those same IP addresses can be used
both for good and also for evil,",00:01:24.000,00:01:27.830
"to track you, for instance.",00:01:27.830,00:01:29.270
"In fact, every one of you with a laptop
open now, or a phone in your",00:01:29.270,00:01:32.200
"pocket, has an IP address
on Harvard's network.",00:01:32.200,00:01:35.070
"And it's not all that difficult to
correlate that to who and where you",00:01:35.070,00:01:39.120
are these days.,00:01:39.120,00:01:40.180
"But more on that perhaps
in the future.",00:01:40.180,00:01:42.090
"&gt;&gt; Now I thought I'd bring back some
memories of [? enhance ?] and give you",00:01:42.090,00:01:46.510
"another clip from a show you
might find familiar.",00:01:46.510,00:01:49.360
"If we could dim the lights
for just a few seconds.",00:01:49.360,00:01:52.710
The show Numb3rs.,00:01:52.710,00:01:53.960
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 2: It's a 32-bit IPP4 address.,00:01:57.510,00:02:00.540
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 3: IPP, as in internet?",00:02:00.540,00:02:01.610
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 2: Private network.,00:02:01.610,00:02:02.968
To Amita's private network.,00:02:02.968,00:02:04.960
She is so amazing.,00:02:16.930,00:02:19.602
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 3: Come on, Charlie.",00:02:19.602,00:02:21.030
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 2: It's.,00:02:21.030,00:02:21.490
A mirror IP address.,00:02:21.490,00:02:22.470
"She's letting us watch what
she's doing in real time.",00:02:22.470,00:02:27.680
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: OK, so a few things
wrong with this picture.",00:02:27.680,00:02:30.930
"So one, and this one is acceptable,
this is actually",00:02:30.930,00:02:32.920
not a valid IP address.,00:02:32.920,00:02:34.400
"A valid IP address has to be numbers
of the form w.x.y.z, where each of",00:02:34.400,00:02:38.190
those letters is 0 to 255.,00:02:38.190,00:02:40.000
"But that's fine because just like the
movies where they fake phone numbers,",00:02:40.000,00:02:42.330
they fake IP addresses.,00:02:42.330,00:02:43.520
You don't actually hit real servers.,00:02:43.520,00:02:45.230
"&gt;&gt; But mind you, this is a browser.",00:02:45.230,00:02:46.760
"And browsers do not start outputting
computer code like this.",00:02:46.760,00:02:50.760
"And if we look a little deeper, notice
that the language that they're seeing",00:02:50.760,00:02:54.230
"on the screen is a language called
Objective C, which is the language in",00:02:54.230,00:02:57.040
"which iPhone apps are written,
particularly the ones involving",00:02:57.040,00:02:59.520
"crayons, as you can see from
the source code here.",00:02:59.520,00:03:03.540
"&gt;&gt; OK, I thought this was funny.",00:03:06.600,00:03:07.560
"So this snippet of code has absolutely
nothing to do with whatever this",00:03:07.560,00:03:12.240
particular episode was about.,00:03:12.240,00:03:13.940
"So the joke is sort of on the folks
taking for this granted.",00:03:13.940,00:03:17.590
"But this is not all that hard to get
these technical details right.",00:03:17.590,00:03:20.220
And I would encourage you.,00:03:20.220,00:03:21.980
"And actually, 50 might very well spoil
a lot of TV shows and movies or you",00:03:21.980,00:03:25.530
"because you'll find that it's just
not possible what they're",00:03:25.530,00:03:27.320
doing on the screen.,00:03:27.320,00:03:28.630
"But indeed, this is the code that you
might see it in an iPhone application",00:03:28.630,00:03:31.750
or Mac OS application.,00:03:31.750,00:03:33.640
"It has nothing at all
to do with security.",00:03:33.640,00:03:35.685
"So keep an eye out for more
such fun things like that.",00:03:35.685,00:03:38.610
"&gt;&gt; But today we begin to dive in really
deeply to a whole range of languages.",00:03:38.610,00:03:42.720
"An indeed, one of the overarching
takeaways of this portion of the",00:03:42.720,00:03:45.410
"course is not to learn how to program
in PHP, not to learn SQL per se, not",00:03:45.410,00:03:51.815
"to learn JavaScript per se, but rather
to teach yourself how to teach",00:03:51.815,00:03:58.100
"yourself new languages because, indeed,
we begin to take now the",00:03:58.100,00:04:02.030
"training wheels off so that after
course's end, you don't expect a 20",00:04:02.030,00:04:06.020
"page specification to tell you how
to implement some program.",00:04:06.020,00:04:08.890
"You have enough ingredients in your
mind, and enough tools in your tool",00:04:08.890,00:04:12.970
"kit, with which to start building
solutions to problems of interest to",00:04:12.970,00:04:15.750
"you for some students group, for some
research project, or really anything",00:04:15.750,00:04:19.130
of interest to you.,00:04:19.130,00:04:20.140
"&gt;&gt; So toward that end, recall that this was
the picture we drew it last time.",00:04:20.140,00:04:24.150
"And this is two computers, client and
sever, talking to one another.",00:04:24.150,00:04:27.620
"And the protocol, the language, so to
speak, that these two computers happen",00:04:27.620,00:04:31.130
to be speaking is called HTTP.,00:04:31.130,00:04:33.220
"And that's just the protocol used by
computers to transfer information over",00:04:33.220,00:04:37.730
the world wide web.,00:04:37.730,00:04:38.710
"The web, of course, is just one service
that runs on top of the",00:04:38.710,00:04:41.770
so-called internet.,00:04:41.770,00:04:43.000
"What's another service available on
top of the internet these days?",00:04:43.000,00:04:48.660
Some other protocol or-- what's that?,00:04:48.660,00:04:51.600
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: FTP.,00:04:51.600,00:04:52.300
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: FTP.,00:04:52.300,00:04:52.790
So File Transfer Protocol is another.,00:04:52.790,00:04:54.630
Most of you probably haven't used it.,00:04:54.630,00:04:56.050
"But most of you probably have used
things like Gchat, or instant",00:04:56.050,00:04:58.830
"messaging more generally,
certainly email.",00:04:58.830,00:05:00.970
"And those, too, are services that run on
top of the internet because, at the",00:05:00.970,00:05:04.470
"end of the day, the internet itself
really just get data from point A to",00:05:04.470,00:05:08.180
"point B. And it uses a number of
particles itself, one of them or two",00:05:08.180,00:05:12.480
"of them most generally called TCP/IP,
which is to say that one computer on",00:05:12.480,00:05:17.340
"the internet can actually be doing
different things, email,",00:05:17.340,00:05:19.960
"and web, and so forth.",00:05:19.960,00:05:20.980
Google does a lot of this.,00:05:20.980,00:05:22.220
"So how are those services uniquely
identified, did we say, on a computer",00:05:22.220,00:05:26.310
"that might actually be doing
multiple things?",00:05:26.310,00:05:29.080
&gt;&gt; The port number.,00:05:29.080,00:05:29.860
"And these are just arbitrary human
conventions like 80 is web, 443 is",00:05:29.860,00:05:34.180
"encrypted web, 25 is email.",00:05:34.180,00:05:36.580
And there's a bunches of others.,00:05:36.580,00:05:38.230
"And those numbers are simply included in
those packets of information, those",00:05:38.230,00:05:41.860
"virtual envelope, that actually
contained a request or a response.",00:05:41.860,00:05:46.230
"&gt;&gt; So when you get back a response from the
web, typically, you don't see any",00:05:46.230,00:05:51.300
"numbers whatsoever in terms of the
status code of the response.",00:05:51.300,00:05:54.780
"You don't actually see the
inner workings of the",00:05:54.780,00:05:56.770
packets that come back.,00:05:56.770,00:05:58.090
But 200 does indeed mean OK.,00:05:58.090,00:05:59.860
And that means all is well.,00:05:59.860,00:06:01.530
You might have seen a bunch of these.,00:06:01.530,00:06:02.870
"Which is probably the most common
you've seen on the web?",00:06:02.870,00:06:05.710
&gt;&gt; 404.,00:06:05.710,00:06:05.980
It just means file not found.,00:06:05.980,00:06:07.330
It means someone screwed up.,00:06:07.330,00:06:08.270
"You did by mistyping the URL, or someone
else did by giving you an",00:06:08.270,00:06:11.450
"invalid URL, or they deleted the
file and the URL is still",00:06:11.450,00:06:15.100
being used by people.,00:06:15.100,00:06:16.130
"So any number of reasons can explain
why a file is not found.",00:06:16.130,00:06:19.670
"And you'll see, in the weeks to come,
these other error codes, and you'll",00:06:19.670,00:06:22.990
take advantage of some of them.,00:06:22.990,00:06:24.195
The worst is 500.,00:06:24.195,00:06:25.760
"If you get a 500 error in code you've
written, think of that as sort of the",00:06:25.760,00:06:29.820
"analog of seg faults in the
world of web programming.",00:06:29.820,00:06:33.290
It's not quite as dire.,00:06:33.290,00:06:34.560
"But it just means that, somewhere,
you screwed up.",00:06:34.560,00:06:36.660
So look forward to those.,00:06:36.660,00:06:38.260
"&gt;&gt; But let's see if we can
see these in context.",00:06:38.260,00:06:39.910
"Let me go to a browser here
and do the following.",00:06:39.910,00:06:43.460
"So this is Chrome, which happens to
be installed in the appliance.",00:06:43.460,00:06:45.710
"But most every browser these days has
some equivalent functionality.",00:06:45.710,00:06:49.410
"I'm going to go up the Chrome's menu,
and go to Tools, and I'm going to go",00:06:49.410,00:06:52.610
to Developer Tools.,00:06:52.610,00:06:53.990
"And you'll see that this little panel
opens in the bottom of the window.",00:06:53.990,00:06:57.040
"Another shortcut, to be honest, that I
usually use myself is to Right click",00:06:57.040,00:07:00.190
"or Control click anywhere on the web
page and just go to Inspect Element.",00:07:00.190,00:07:04.370
"And that will not only open
this have for you.",00:07:04.370,00:07:07.440
"It will also open, specifically,
the Elements portion on",00:07:07.440,00:07:10.230
the left hand side.,00:07:10.230,00:07:11.430
&gt;&gt; So we're of course seeing Google.,00:07:11.430,00:07:12.460
They changed their logo today.,00:07:12.460,00:07:13.930
"But on if I scroll down up here, notice
that under Elements, you see",00:07:13.930,00:07:20.200
"what's called HTML, HyperText Markup
Language, and this is the language",00:07:20.200,00:07:23.460
"that this and all web pages,
really, are written in.",00:07:23.460,00:07:26.000
"But it's actually formatted for
us so much more readably",00:07:26.000,00:07:28.950
than it normally is.,00:07:28.950,00:07:29.970
"In fact, if I zoom out, and I instead
just Right click or Control Click",00:07:29.970,00:07:34.810
"click on the page, and then go to View
Page Source, this is literally what",00:07:34.810,00:07:39.630
Google sent down to my browser.,00:07:39.630,00:07:42.150
"&gt;&gt; So some person or persons wrote
Google.com using this source code.",00:07:42.150,00:07:46.480
Most of this is not HTML.,00:07:46.480,00:07:47.790
"It's actually a language called
JavaScript, which",00:07:47.790,00:07:49.340
we'll come to on Wednesday.,00:07:49.340,00:07:50.880
"But what Chrome, and what every browser
can do for us, is kind of see",00:07:50.880,00:07:55.580
"past all of the distractions of the
crazy syntax, and reinsert white space",00:07:55.580,00:07:59.610
"for us, and even syntax highlight,
or colorize things for us.",00:07:59.610,00:08:02.940
"So you'll find that these so-called
developer tools built into browsers",00:08:02.940,00:08:06.470
"will make your life so, so much easier
because you can explore, via this menu",00:08:06.470,00:08:10.830
"interface, exactly what the underlying
source code is for",00:08:10.830,00:08:13.940
any page on the internet.,00:08:13.940,00:08:15.750
"And indeed, this is one of the most
effective ways to learn how to do",00:08:15.750,00:08:19.070
"something new, at least if the page
isn't so complex as to overwhelm, is",00:08:19.070,00:08:22.860
"to start poking around it's HTML, look
at its so-called CSS, which we'll come",00:08:22.860,00:08:26.700
"to a bit as well, to get an
understanding of how that programmer",00:08:26.700,00:08:30.310
"implemented some particular
feature of the page.",00:08:30.310,00:08:33.480
"&gt;&gt; But more technically interesting right
now it's going to be this.",00:08:33.480,00:08:36.530
"If I go to the Network tab,
let's now clear this.",00:08:36.530,00:08:39.429
"I'm going to click the little
cross symbol here, and then",00:08:39.429,00:08:43.429
go to another website.,00:08:43.429,00:08:45.630
"And I'm just going to type
in Facebook.com.",00:08:45.630,00:08:48.430
"No HTTP, no HTTPS, no WWW.",00:08:48.430,00:08:51.940
Let's actually see what happens here.,00:08:51.940,00:08:53.850
&gt;&gt; Enter.,00:08:53.850,00:08:55.030
"Now notice a whole bunch of stuff just
appeared in this bottom panel, in",00:08:55.030,00:08:58.480
"addition to the web page
appearing in the top.",00:08:58.480,00:09:00.285
"I'm going to scroll back up into the
Network tab here, and I'm going to",00:09:00.285,00:09:04.890
click on the first row.,00:09:04.890,00:09:06.080
"What this tool is going to reveal to us
is every one of the HTTP requests",00:09:06.080,00:09:10.580
"that rapidly just went back and
forth between my browser",00:09:10.580,00:09:13.550
and Facebook's server.,00:09:13.550,00:09:14.930
"And so every one of those rows
represents one such request or",00:09:14.930,00:09:17.830
"response, one or more of
those virtual envelope.",00:09:17.830,00:09:20.970
"Or more casually, it's like a person
like a person, a customer in a",00:09:20.970,00:09:24.080
"restaurant, asking for something
again, and again, and again.",00:09:24.080,00:09:26.710
"And the waiter keeps bringing
it back one at a time.",00:09:26.710,00:09:29.400
"&gt;&gt; So now, if I zoom in on this, notice
and this will be the sort of thing",00:09:29.400,00:09:33.850
"that you're welcome to and encouraged
to play with on your own, because we",00:09:33.850,00:09:36.600
"won't go through everything
in great detail.",00:09:36.600,00:09:38.150
"But notice there's a
few sub tabs here--",00:09:38.150,00:09:40.070
"Headers, Preview, Response,
Cookies, and timing.",00:09:40.070,00:09:43.700
"I'm just going to look at headers
for now because these are little",00:09:43.700,00:09:48.280
"ingredients inside of the envelope that
help data get to and from places.",00:09:48.280,00:09:53.600
"&gt;&gt; So first, let me click this, View
Source next to Request Headers.",00:09:53.600,00:09:57.590
"There is the request that my browser,
Chrome, in this case, sent inside of",00:09:57.590,00:10:01.910
that virtual envelope.,00:10:01.910,00:10:02.910
"You'll recall last week I
manually typed it while",00:10:02.910,00:10:04.800
pretending to be a browser.,00:10:04.800,00:10:06.380
"Then it reminded the server that it's
looking for the host called",00:10:06.380,00:10:09.980
Facebook.com.,00:10:09.980,00:10:10.835
"And then there's a bit more arcane
information that we'll wave",00:10:10.835,00:10:13.630
our hands for now.,00:10:13.630,00:10:14.830
"&gt;&gt; But if I start to scroll down now in
this window, let me get to the",00:10:14.830,00:10:18.640
response headers.,00:10:18.640,00:10:19.980
"This was what's in the virtual
envelope that came back from",00:10:19.980,00:10:23.270
Facebook.com.,00:10:23.270,00:10:24.095
"And if I click View Source just
to see the raw text of it,",00:10:24.095,00:10:27.390
notice a few things.,00:10:27.390,00:10:28.400
"One, Facebook also speaks the same
protocol, version 1.1 thereof.",00:10:28.400,00:10:32.130
So that's nice.,00:10:32.130,00:10:33.390
"But status code 301,
moved permanently.",00:10:33.390,00:10:36.820
"&gt;&gt; Well, where the heck did Facebook go?",00:10:36.820,00:10:38.880
What's this trying to convey to us?,00:10:38.880,00:10:40.430
"Well, notice down here there's another
header called Location.",00:10:40.430,00:10:44.310
"So why is Facebook telling me that they
moved permanently to that URL",00:10:44.310,00:10:51.050
next to Location?,00:10:51.050,00:10:53.580
I forgot the www.,00:10:53.580,00:10:54.962
&gt;&gt; So that was my choice.,00:10:54.962,00:10:56.250
"In fact, most of us rarely, probably,
type www.whatever.com these days.",00:10:56.250,00:11:00.450
"But it turns out a system administrator,
like Facebook's, can",00:11:00.450,00:11:03.390
"configure their servers in such a way
that either Facebook.com works, or",00:11:03.390,00:11:06.800
"www.Facebook.com works, or, really,
any such prefix in front of their",00:11:06.800,00:11:12.450
domain name.,00:11:12.450,00:11:13.210
So they've done that for us.,00:11:13.210,00:11:14.500
"And they are redirecting us, probably
for some technical,",00:11:14.500,00:11:16.910
some marketing reasons.,00:11:16.910,00:11:18.100
"They just want to canonicalize
on www.Facebook.com.",00:11:18.100,00:11:21.570
&gt;&gt; But that's not quite it.,00:11:21.570,00:11:24.040
"If I scroll down here, let's
see what happens.",00:11:24.040,00:11:28.560
"This is telling me we
moved permanently to",00:11:28.560,00:11:30.810
http://www.Facebook.com.,00:11:30.810,00:11:33.450
"So let's look at the second request
that my browser sends.",00:11:33.450,00:11:36.620
"Unfortunately, it looks like Facebook
has moved again because the second",00:11:36.620,00:11:40.070
"request, by selecting that URL instead,
says that, too, moved",00:11:40.070,00:11:44.420
permanently.,00:11:44.420,00:11:45.010
"And let me scroll down here
to the response headers.",00:11:45.010,00:11:48.140
Where has Facebook gone now?,00:11:48.140,00:11:51.530
&gt;&gt; So HTTPS.,00:11:51.530,00:11:52.680
"So now Facebook has started,
particularly in light of current",00:11:52.680,00:11:56.130
"events in recent months, especially and
also in the past couple of years",00:11:56.130,00:11:59.750
"to compel all of their users, in a good
way, to use HTTPS, which is more",00:11:59.750,00:12:03.670
"secure, although not entirely secure.",00:12:03.670,00:12:06.210
"And so now my page, my browser is
going to request this third URL.",00:12:06.210,00:12:10.000
"And now, finally, we get the
otherwise unseen 200 OK.",00:12:10.000,00:12:14.710
"&gt;&gt; So what in the world or all of
these other rows down here.",00:12:14.710,00:12:18.830
"I literally typed one thing, and my
browser seems to have requested like",00:12:18.830,00:12:22.630
20 some odd things.,00:12:22.630,00:12:23.840
What is that?,00:12:23.840,00:12:24.640
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Scripts?,00:12:24.640,00:12:25.810
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Scripts, so other files
written in a language called",00:12:25.810,00:12:28.460
"JavaScript, which, again, we'll
see a bit of on Wednesday.",00:12:28.460,00:12:30.780
What else?,00:12:30.780,00:12:32.760
Style sheets.,00:12:32.760,00:12:33.390
"So something in a language called
CSS, which we'll see in a bit.",00:12:33.390,00:12:36.350
"Gifs, and jpegs, and pngs, and images,
and movie files-- whatever a web page",00:12:36.350,00:12:40.690
"has is most likely in
the form of a file.",00:12:40.690,00:12:43.280
"And so what we're seeing on the left
hand side there is all of the files",00:12:43.280,00:12:46.750
"that Chrome had to download,
recursively, if you will, in order to",00:12:46.750,00:12:50.280
compose the entirety of the page.,00:12:50.280,00:12:52.430
"&gt;&gt; So what we saw a moment ago with Google,
if I click on the Elements",00:12:52.430,00:12:56.210
"tab, this, sure, is the HTML, the
language that composes this page.",00:12:56.210,00:13:00.470
But there's bunches of other things.,00:13:00.470,00:13:01.890
There's a logo.,00:13:01.890,00:13:02.640
"There's those blue-ish
icons over there.",00:13:02.640,00:13:04.680
"And there's other elements still on
the page that themselves might be",00:13:04.680,00:13:07.610
separate files.,00:13:07.610,00:13:08.610
"&gt;&gt; So what's nice about a browser is that
it looks at the language we're going",00:13:08.610,00:13:11.860
"to start writing, or you've already
started writing in P set 7, figures",00:13:11.860,00:13:14.690
"out where those files live, and
goes and grabs them as well.",00:13:14.690,00:13:17.970
"And I can't emphasize enough, even
though some of this might look a bit",00:13:17.970,00:13:21.010
"arcane or overwhelming at first glance,
learning how to program",00:13:21.010,00:13:24.820
"applications for the web, it's
invaluable to understand how these",00:13:24.820,00:13:28.500
little tools work.,00:13:28.500,00:13:29.410
"These are sort of like GDB like tools,
but much simpler, ultimately, to use--",00:13:29.410,00:13:33.830
"and really gives you eyes into what
we've been taking for granted for",00:13:33.830,00:13:37.690
quite some time now.,00:13:37.690,00:13:39.170
"&gt;&gt; So what can we now do with
this information?",00:13:39.170,00:13:42.270
"Well, let's actually take a look at
the concepts underlying HTML.",00:13:42.270,00:13:44.875
"And we'll defer, as we already have, to
sections this week, to the problem",00:13:44.875,00:13:49.025
"set 7 specification, to some of the more
particulars of these languages.",00:13:49.025,00:13:53.260
"But let's see if we can't paint a
picture of what you should understand",00:13:53.260,00:13:57.020
overall here.,00:13:57.020,00:13:57.940
"&gt;&gt; So HTML, HyperText Markup Language,
is not a programming language.",00:13:57.940,00:14:02.280
What does that really mean?,00:14:02.280,00:14:03.520
So HTML looks like this.,00:14:03.520,00:14:05.690
And some of you already know this.,00:14:05.690,00:14:06.810
"Some of you have been doing
this for some time.",00:14:06.810,00:14:08.130
"But let's see if we can't fill
in some blanks as well.",00:14:08.130,00:14:10.270
So notice a couple of things here.,00:14:10.270,00:14:11.760
"One, it's just text.",00:14:11.760,00:14:13.030
"So it's just like source code in
C, or some other language.",00:14:13.030,00:14:15.960
"&gt;&gt; Notice that there seems
to be a pattern here.",00:14:15.960,00:14:17.750
"There's indentation, but technically
the indentation is just human",00:14:17.750,00:14:20.870
convention.,00:14:20.870,00:14:21.205
"A browsers doesn't care if there's new
lines and tabs like we see there.",00:14:21.205,00:14:24.980
"But notice that there's
symmetries here.",00:14:24.980,00:14:27.410
"There's what I'll call, at the top of
this file, the open tag, or the start",00:14:27.410,00:14:31.180
"tag, called HTML.",00:14:31.180,00:14:33.030
"And then, down below, perfectly lined
up, much like we do with curly braces,",00:14:33.030,00:14:36.800
"we see open bracket, forward
slash, HTML, close bracket.",00:14:36.800,00:14:40.910
"So that's the corresponding close
tag, or end tag, for that thing.",00:14:40.910,00:14:44.610
"&gt;&gt; Together, everything inside of the
so-called open tag and close tag",00:14:44.610,00:14:47.990
compose what we'll call an element.,00:14:47.990,00:14:50.440
"And we'll see, in just a moment, it's
really like a node in a trees.",00:14:50.440,00:14:53.910
"Because if you think about now the
indentation that's implied here, you",00:14:53.910,00:14:57.470
"kind of have, like, a grandparent
node called HTML.",00:14:57.470,00:15:00.780
"How many children might you say, based
on this picture, the HTML element has?",00:15:00.780,00:15:06.870
&gt;&gt; So probably two.,00:15:06.870,00:15:07.720
"One is the head element, apparently.",00:15:07.720,00:15:10.240
And one is the body element.,00:15:10.240,00:15:11.710
And why two children?,00:15:11.710,00:15:12.555
"Well, I'm just kind of inferring that if
I have an open head tag and then a",00:15:12.555,00:15:15.840
"close head tag, that's an element.",00:15:15.840,00:15:17.820
"And then, if there's another open body
tag and a close body tag, that's like",00:15:17.820,00:15:21.200
another element.,00:15:21.200,00:15:22.340
"So in the sense that if I kind of rotate
the picture on its side, it's",00:15:22.340,00:15:26.000
"like having an HTML tag, and then a
head tag, and then a body tag, and",00:15:26.000,00:15:29.910
"then some text, hello world, dangling
off of the body tag itself.",00:15:29.910,00:15:34.290
"&gt;&gt; So we can draw a picture that
might look like this.",00:15:34.290,00:15:36.620
The shapes are arbitrary.,00:15:36.620,00:15:38.020
"But notice that I've used sort of an
ellipse at the top to represent the",00:15:38.020,00:15:40.870
document itself.,00:15:40.870,00:15:41.860
"It turns out there can be other stuff
inside of a web page that I've not",00:15:41.860,00:15:45.980
drawn here.,00:15:45.980,00:15:46.940
"So we're going to even hang the HTML
node off of a so-called document node.",00:15:46.940,00:15:50.800
"And then we have head and
body and title, notice,",00:15:50.800,00:15:53.730
which is nested further.,00:15:53.730,00:15:55.360
"I didn't bother putting additional line
breaks inside of the title tag.",00:15:55.360,00:15:58.650
"It just felt like it was getting
a little too verbose.",00:15:58.650,00:16:02.710
"So I left it in one line there, with
open title, hello world, close title.",00:16:02.710,00:16:07.000
"And then we have some text
dangling off of here.",00:16:07.000,00:16:09.380
"&gt;&gt; So this picture will come back to
us when we dive into JavaScript.",00:16:09.380,00:16:12.200
"And understanding that when you
write HTML like this, what",00:16:12.200,00:16:15.110
is a browser doing?,00:16:15.110,00:16:16.250
"Well, we don't have to worry about
how it's doing this, or with what",00:16:16.250,00:16:19.290
"algorithm, but at the end of the day,
when a browser receives HTML like",00:16:19.290,00:16:23.090
"that, from Facebook or Google, it parses
it, so to speak, it reads it,",00:16:23.090,00:16:27.510
"with something like fread, top to
bottom, left to right, and as it",00:16:27.510,00:16:31.160
"realizes, oh, open tag, and then close
tag, it starts to malloc, so to speak,",00:16:31.160,00:16:36.300
a node in a tree.,00:16:36.300,00:16:37.800
"And when it encounters, as we've implied
here with the indentation, a",00:16:37.800,00:16:41.130
"child node, it mallocs a node for that
and attached that to the tree.",00:16:41.130,00:16:45.400
"&gt;&gt; So the tree structures, binary trees,
ternary trees, and bigger trees, that",00:16:45.400,00:16:49.150
"we glanced at a week or two ago, notice
that the same principle is",00:16:49.150,00:16:53.380
coming back to us.,00:16:53.380,00:16:54.220
"And whoever implemented, Chrome whatever
team did that, presumably had",00:16:54.220,00:16:57.590
"to implement some kind of tree structure
underneath the hood.",00:16:57.590,00:17:00.800
"And that itself is probably in a
language like C, or C++, or a lower",00:17:00.800,00:17:05.329
"level language that we'll
now use atop the web.",00:17:05.329,00:17:08.540
"&gt;&gt; So now, maybe, this will
make more sense.",00:17:08.540,00:17:11.200
"Actual tattoo from some guy who might
regret it eventually, kind of.",00:17:11.200,00:17:15.420
"OK, all right, so a lot of web humor.",00:17:15.420,00:17:17.359
"It's not really going
over so well today.",00:17:17.359,00:17:18.599
So we'll move on.,00:17:18.599,00:17:19.560
All right.,00:17:19.560,00:17:20.180
"&gt;&gt; So let's take a look now
at a few examples.",00:17:20.180,00:17:22.760
"The simplest possible
thing might be this.",00:17:22.760,00:17:24.660
"I'm going to go ahead and open up in
gedit a file called hello.php.",00:17:24.660,00:17:29.170
"And inside of here, I'm going to quickly
just do this, printf, quote",00:17:31.730,00:17:36.330
"unquote, ""hello world.""",00:17:36.330,00:17:38.590
"&gt;&gt; So notice, and I'll do my backslash n,
I've not bothered to declare main.",00:17:38.590,00:17:42.460
"It turns out, in php, and a lot of
languages, you don't need a main",00:17:42.460,00:17:45.310
function per se.,00:17:45.310,00:17:46.090
"You can just start writing
your program.",00:17:46.090,00:17:47.720
"Now, when I save this file, notice I'm
going to have to do the following.",00:17:47.720,00:17:51.210
"I'm not going to use make, and I'm not
going to use clang because PHP, unlike",00:17:51.210,00:17:55.360
"C, is not a compiled language.",00:17:55.360,00:17:57.400
"It's what's called an interpreted
language, which means that you run it",00:17:57.400,00:18:01.400
"as an input through another program
called an interpreter.",00:18:01.400,00:18:04.650
"And that program reads it, top to
bottom, left to right, and does",00:18:04.650,00:18:08.150
whatever you tell it to do.,00:18:08.150,00:18:09.290
"&gt;&gt; So in this case here I have
one line that says printf.",00:18:09.290,00:18:12.920
"So when I run this source code,
hello.php, though a program that",00:18:12.920,00:18:17.990
"happens, conveniently, to be called PHP,
that program PHP is going to read",00:18:17.990,00:18:22.830
"this file, top to bottom, left to right,
and it's going to do what I",00:18:22.830,00:18:26.120
"tell it to do-- executing code, and if
it doesn't recognize something, just",00:18:26.120,00:18:30.110
spitting it out.,00:18:30.110,00:18:31.320
"So I'm going to go ahead and
run PHP of hello.php.",00:18:31.320,00:18:34.940
Enter.,00:18:34.940,00:18:37.110
&gt;&gt; And that's not quite what I intended.,00:18:37.110,00:18:39.690
"Well, why is that?",00:18:39.690,00:18:40.530
"Well, PHP is a language that's actually
designed to be fairly",00:18:40.530,00:18:43.910
intertwined with the web.,00:18:43.910,00:18:46.150
"When making web pages with this language
PHP, as we'll soon see, we'll",00:18:46.150,00:18:50.460
"want to do something like print
out lines like this.",00:18:50.460,00:18:54.560
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to do this.,00:18:54.560,00:18:55.940
"Open bracket, question mark, PHP, and
now I'm just going indent just to keep",00:18:55.940,00:19:00.810
things nice.,00:19:00.810,00:19:01.960
"And now I'm going to do a question
mark close bracket.",00:19:01.960,00:19:04.910
So there's a bit of asymmetry here.,00:19:04.910,00:19:06.270
You don't do this.,00:19:06.270,00:19:07.490
"And you don't do a slash, so
PHP is a little different.",00:19:07.490,00:19:10.530
"&gt;&gt; But now, if I rerun this program,
PHP hello.php, now I",00:19:10.530,00:19:14.610
actually get Hello World.,00:19:14.610,00:19:16.090
And we'll see why this is valuable.,00:19:16.090,00:19:17.750
"One, it allows me to specify,
super explicitly, this is",00:19:17.750,00:19:20.960
"code, execute this.",00:19:20.960,00:19:22.480
"And that's indeed what these
special tags imply here.",00:19:22.480,00:19:25.480
"&gt;&gt; But it also means that if I just do
something like I aim over here, that",00:19:25.480,00:19:30.330
"means that, literally, that will just
be printed out without the need to",00:19:30.330,00:19:34.000
"actually call printf, or print,
or any similar function.",00:19:34.000,00:19:36.850
"So we'll come back to that
in just a moment.",00:19:36.850,00:19:39.445
"&gt;&gt; First, let's do this.",00:19:39.445,00:19:40.470
"Inside of the appliance, we have a
directory called Vhosts, for virtual",00:19:40.470,00:19:43.950
"hosts, slash local host, slash public.",00:19:43.950,00:19:47.000
"So it's a bit verbose, but long story
short, the appliance is designed not",00:19:47.000,00:19:50.240
"only to support C. It's also
designed to support PHP.",00:19:50.240,00:19:53.770
"But it's also designed to be a web
server, and a database server.",00:19:53.770,00:19:57.440
"And it's designed, and truly configured,
to be reminiscent of any",00:19:57.440,00:20:00.230
"commercial web hosting company that
you might pay $5 a month for,",00:20:00.230,00:20:04.230
$100 a month for.,00:20:04.230,00:20:05.040
"Whatever the service is, it's configured
to be very similar to a",00:20:05.040,00:20:08.200
real world production server.,00:20:08.200,00:20:10.170
"&gt;&gt; And what that means is that running on
the appliance is web server software.",00:20:10.170,00:20:13.485
It happens to be called Apache.,00:20:13.485,00:20:15.060
"It's just free, and open source,
and very popular.",00:20:15.060,00:20:17.790
"And we have configured Apache to know
that if I visit a certain URL, with",00:20:17.790,00:20:23.260
"Chrome or any browser inside of the
appliance, to look into this directory",00:20:23.260,00:20:28.060
"for the files that the
user is requesting.",00:20:28.060,00:20:31.030
"&gt;&gt; In other words, let me
go ahead and do this.",00:20:31.030,00:20:32.790
"Inside of my public directory, I'm going
to go ahead and create a file",00:20:32.790,00:20:36.890
called index.html.,00:20:36.890,00:20:39.580
That gives me the tab here.,00:20:39.580,00:20:41.000
"And I'm going to go very quickly
and go ahead and bang out",00:20:41.000,00:20:44.210
this program here.,00:20:44.210,00:20:45.010
"Doctype HTML, which for now, just
assume you have to type.",00:20:45.010,00:20:48.410
"It's just an arcane tag, that's not
truly an HTML tag, that specifies that",00:20:48.410,00:20:53.490
here comes some HTML.,00:20:53.490,00:20:55.050
"&gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and recreate
what we saw a moment ago.",00:20:55.050,00:20:57.400
Here's the head of the page.,00:20:57.400,00:20:58.650
Inside of the head was the--,00:20:58.650,00:21:01.170
so title.,00:21:01.170,00:21:01.890
"So we'll say hello, world.",00:21:01.890,00:21:04.340
And then down here was the body tag.,00:21:04.340,00:21:06.570
Let me close the body tag.,00:21:06.570,00:21:08.580
"And then in here I'll also say,
just for clarity, hello world.",00:21:08.580,00:21:12.280
"&gt;&gt; So this is, arguably, the simplest
possible web page you",00:21:12.280,00:21:14.770
can make that's valid.,00:21:14.770,00:21:15.770
It's syntactically valid.,00:21:15.770,00:21:17.030
Everything that's opened is closed.,00:21:17.030,00:21:18.620
"Everything's nicely in
styled and indented.",00:21:18.620,00:21:20.910
"So let's see now how I
can access this file.",00:21:20.910,00:21:23.600
"&gt;&gt; Well, let me go to Chrome here.",00:21:23.600,00:21:25.540
"And let me go to
http://localhost/index.html.",00:21:25.540,00:21:35.050
So what's local host?,00:21:35.050,00:21:36.200
"Well, most any computer in the world,
Linux, Mac OS, Windows, has a nickname",00:21:36.200,00:21:39.400
called local host.,00:21:39.400,00:21:40.680
"So if you ever want to talk
to your own computer--",00:21:40.680,00:21:42.900
"albeit, oddly reflexively--",00:21:42.900,00:21:45.140
you call yourself local host.,00:21:45.140,00:21:47.080
"No matter what your actual computer is
called, whether it's David's MacBook",00:21:47.080,00:21:50.390
"Air, or something more
verbose like that.",00:21:50.390,00:21:52.490
"&gt;&gt; So this URL is apparently going to use
the HTTP to talk to the local host,",00:21:52.490,00:21:57.760
"the same computer, the appliance, and
it's going to ask for, just take a",00:21:57.760,00:22:00.800
"guess, what file?",00:22:00.800,00:22:02.570
Index.html.,00:22:02.570,00:22:04.460
"So the appliance has been configured in
advance to know that if I'm asking",00:22:04.460,00:22:08.650
"for something like index.html, look for
in a folder called Vhosts, in a",00:22:08.650,00:22:13.460
"folder called localhost, in a folder
therein called public.",00:22:13.460,00:22:17.950
"That's where all of my public
files are going to be.",00:22:17.950,00:22:20.400
So I'm now going to hit Enter.,00:22:20.400,00:22:22.610
"&gt;&gt; And damn, there is that forbidden
message, otherwise known as 403, the",00:22:22.610,00:22:27.100
numeric code for it.,00:22:27.100,00:22:28.490
So what's wrong here?,00:22:28.490,00:22:30.130
"Well, it's not enough to just put
the file inside of my folder.",00:22:30.130,00:22:33.210
I need to actually do the following.,00:22:33.210,00:22:35.790
"&gt;&gt; Let me go into my Vhosts directory, into
localhost, into public, and let",00:22:35.790,00:22:40.210
me do ls dash l.,00:22:40.210,00:22:41.680
"And there's a few other things
in here for today's purposes.",00:22:41.680,00:22:44.510
"But notice on the left hand side, next
to index.html, we only see one RW.",00:22:44.510,00:22:50.540
"And in the past, what
has RW stood for?",00:22:50.540,00:22:53.560
&gt;&gt; Just read or write.,00:22:53.560,00:22:54.240
"The fact that it says rw on the left
means I, the owner of this file, can",00:22:54.240,00:22:58.000
read or write it.,00:22:58.000,00:22:59.020
"But I need to let all people in the
world read this, though not write it.",00:22:59.020,00:23:05.010
"So I'm going to change the mode of the
file, chmod, all plus r to give",00:23:05.010,00:23:09.650
"everyone read permission on the
file called index.html.",00:23:09.650,00:23:13.910
"&gt;&gt; And if I now retype ls dash l, notice
that, over here, some more",00:23:13.910,00:23:18.040
R's have popped up.,00:23:18.040,00:23:19.160
"And for now, the spec goes
into more detail.",00:23:19.160,00:23:21.090
"For P set 7, that just means everyone
can now read this file.",00:23:21.090,00:23:24.450
"If I go back to my browser
now and reload, voila.",00:23:24.450,00:23:27.790
Hello world.,00:23:27.790,00:23:28.750
"&gt;&gt; And I can even open my Chrome tools
and see, just like with Google and",00:23:28.750,00:23:32.260
"Facebook that there's my HTML,
formatted a little",00:23:32.260,00:23:34.590
differently and colorized.,00:23:34.590,00:23:35.930
"If I go to the network tab and reload
the page, notice that there is the get",00:23:35.930,00:23:40.450
"request that Chrome is sending
to the appliance.",00:23:40.450,00:23:42.900
"There's the 200 for that
particular file.",00:23:42.900,00:23:46.020
"So in short, this is how all these
various pieces are coming together.",00:23:46.020,00:23:49.340
"It just so happens that the web server
we're using right now isn't remote,",00:23:49.340,00:23:53.530
like Facebook.,00:23:53.530,00:23:54.210
"It's literally on the same computer,
which is perfectly OK.",00:23:54.210,00:23:58.330
&gt;&gt; So what more can we do in a web page?,00:23:58.330,00:24:00.590
"Well, just, let's breeze through
a couple of these things.",00:24:00.590,00:24:03.110
"But let me go ahead and reopen
Gedit with index.html.",00:24:03.110,00:24:07.860
"And let me go ahead and say hello CS50,
save this file, go back to the",00:24:07.860,00:24:13.980
"browser, really underwhelming change.",00:24:13.980,00:24:16.260
"&gt;&gt; But what if we want to actually
link to something now?",00:24:16.260,00:24:19.130
"So it turns out that we can have the
links in HTML that are just tags",00:24:19.130,00:24:23.480
themselves.,00:24:23.480,00:24:24.140
"It happens to be called the
anchor tag. a href equals",00:24:24.140,00:24:27.320
"https://www.cs50.net, www.cs50.net
close quote, close bracket.",00:24:27.320,00:24:33.190
"And now let's see what
else comes next.",00:24:33.190,00:24:35.230
&gt;&gt; I've opened the tag.,00:24:35.230,00:24:36.500
"I now need to give it
a phrase like CS50.",00:24:36.500,00:24:38.990
Let me close the tag.,00:24:38.990,00:24:40.600
And notice a few things.,00:24:40.600,00:24:42.010
"Even though there's this cryptic thing
here, I have not repeated it when you",00:24:42.010,00:24:45.270
close the tag.,00:24:45.270,00:24:46.010
"You just close the tag
with its name alone.",00:24:46.010,00:24:48.230
"And this is what's known as
an attribute with a value.",00:24:48.230,00:24:50.940
"Attributes just modify the behavior
of some tag inside of a page.",00:24:50.940,00:24:56.070
"&gt;&gt; So this is specifying that the hyper
reference, the fancy way of saying the",00:24:56.070,00:24:59.150
"URL for this anchor, for this
link, should be CS50.net.",00:24:59.150,00:25:03.660
"And the text that we want to show the
user isn't that raw URL, but rather",00:25:03.660,00:25:07.440
the word CS50.,00:25:07.440,00:25:08.730
"&gt;&gt; So if now I reload, let me zoom in for
clarity, let me reload the page,",00:25:08.730,00:25:13.710
"notice that we have this old school
blue underlined link.",00:25:13.710,00:25:16.460
"And if I hover over it, and it's going
to be tough to see, in the bottom left",00:25:16.460,00:25:20.000
"hand corner of the screen, notice
that it says the URL to which",00:25:20.000,00:25:23.690
I'm going to go.,00:25:23.690,00:25:24.430
"And if I click there, voila,
now I'm making web pages.",00:25:24.430,00:25:27.940
"And we've led ourselves
to the home page.",00:25:27.940,00:25:30.140
"&gt;&gt; But notice what potential
this offers us.",00:25:30.140,00:25:32.670
"Security is very much
in vogue these days.",00:25:32.670,00:25:34.890
"What if I instead say something like
this, and I instead go to, say, let's",00:25:34.890,00:25:41.210
"see, fakeCS50.net.",00:25:41.210,00:25:42.460
Reload this page.,00:25:44.660,00:25:46.360
"&gt;&gt; OK, so notice it still looks like I'm
going to CS50, unless an astute eye",00:25:46.360,00:25:50.180
will notice I'm going to fake CS50.,00:25:50.180,00:25:51.560
I'm guessing this domain is not taken.,00:25:51.560,00:25:54.550
"OK, so it's not available.",00:25:54.550,00:25:55.960
So that's good.,00:25:55.960,00:25:56.600
No one actually has that domain.,00:25:56.600,00:25:57.900
"&gt;&gt; But let's be a little more malicious
because that's kind of stupid.",00:25:57.900,00:26:00.380
What if we change this to Paypal.,00:26:00.380,00:26:02.240
"And what if we call this, like,
www.paypal.badguy.com,",00:26:02.240,00:26:09.960
whatever the domain is.,00:26:09.960,00:26:12.070
That probably exists.,00:26:12.070,00:26:13.700
So now let me reload the page.,00:26:13.700,00:26:16.260
"And here we have sort of a phishing
attack, P-H-I-S-H-I-N-G, which is the",00:26:16.260,00:26:22.890
"silly word given for an attack that
tries to fish information, or, better",00:26:22.890,00:26:26.760
"yet, money, out of people by tricking
them into providing information that",00:26:26.760,00:26:30.450
they might not otherwise do.,00:26:30.450,00:26:31.990
"This looks totally legit, right?",00:26:31.990,00:26:33.500
I must have a link here to Paypal.com.,00:26:33.500,00:26:34.930
"In fairness, if I sexed it up with some
graphics, we can make it look",00:26:37.700,00:26:40.430
more like PayPal.,00:26:40.430,00:26:41.310
Right?,00:26:41.310,00:26:41.510
"Because I could, as an aside,
I could go to Paypal.com.",00:26:41.510,00:26:43.815
"And we've just seen how I can
see all of their HTML.",00:26:43.815,00:26:47.110
"I could just copy it and recreate the
aesthetics of Paypal rather than go",00:26:47.110,00:26:50.560
old school here.,00:26:50.560,00:26:51.490
"But notice, of course, and it's a little
small still, only in the bottom",00:26:51.490,00:26:55.010
"left hand corner, in like a 10 point
font, do you see what URL you're",00:26:55.010,00:26:59.190
actually going to be led to.,00:26:59.190,00:27:01.310
"&gt;&gt; And so if you've ever gotten spam saying
go ahead, and you're account",00:27:01.310,00:27:06.580
has been compromised.,00:27:06.580,00:27:07.420
"Please click this link and let us know
your password so we can ensure you're",00:27:07.420,00:27:10.615
"you, don't ever do that.",00:27:10.615,00:27:13.010
These things should go without saying.,00:27:13.010,00:27:14.180
"But it's wonderfully amusing, and
tragic, how every year this seems to",00:27:14.180,00:27:17.670
"happen to some non-zero
number of people.",00:27:17.670,00:27:19.660
"&gt;&gt; And that's the beauty
of phishing attacks.",00:27:19.660,00:27:21.400
You can send out a million emails.,00:27:21.400,00:27:23.160
"And even if 0.01% of people actually
click on Paypal and give you your",00:27:23.160,00:27:27.720
"password, that's still a non-zero number
of people who've just giving",00:27:27.720,00:27:31.040
you their money.,00:27:31.040,00:27:32.200
"And sending emails, of course, is quite
easy and, essentially, free",00:27:32.200,00:27:36.170
these days.,00:27:36.170,00:27:36.970
"&gt;&gt; So long story short, wonderfully
beautiful idea, right?",00:27:36.970,00:27:40.410
"Years ago, this was the earliest
web, enabling a web of",00:27:40.410,00:27:44.620
hyperlinks among resources.,00:27:44.620,00:27:46.330
"But so quickly could it be
used for ill purposes.",00:27:46.330,00:27:49.520
"And email, suffice it to say, these
days, have HTML embedded inside.",00:27:49.520,00:27:54.100
"&gt;&gt; Well, let me just one other thing.",00:27:54.100,00:27:55.410
"And we'll defer largely to section in
problem set seven to allow you to",00:27:55.410,00:27:58.640
explore the particulars.,00:27:58.640,00:28:00.000
"But let me go ahead and
do a few things here.",00:28:00.000,00:28:01.990
"I'm going to go in and declare
what's called a div, or",00:28:01.990,00:28:04.840
"division, of the page.",00:28:04.840,00:28:06.080
Let me close that div tag.,00:28:06.080,00:28:07.770
"&gt;&gt; And I'm going to say up
here top of page.",00:28:07.770,00:28:11.460
"And then below this, I'm going to do
something like another div, close this",00:28:11.460,00:28:14.940
"tag, and do bottom of page.",00:28:14.940,00:28:17.800
And let's save it.,00:28:17.800,00:28:18.840
&gt;&gt; So now let's go back to my file.,00:28:18.840,00:28:21.040
Very underwhelming.,00:28:21.040,00:28:22.120
"But what division is used for,
underneath the hood, is it's actually",00:28:22.120,00:28:25.520
a nice structural element.,00:28:25.520,00:28:26.920
"It doesn't have any aesthetics so far as
we can see, other than, apparently,",00:28:26.920,00:28:30.300
putting things on new lines.,00:28:30.300,00:28:31.890
"&gt;&gt; But notice, as an aside, just hitting
Enter does not cut it in HTML like it",00:28:31.890,00:28:36.290
"does in C. You might think that that's
going to put a nice big gap between",00:28:36.290,00:28:39.840
the top and bottom of the page.,00:28:39.840,00:28:41.300
But it's ignored.,00:28:41.300,00:28:43.420
"White space is essentially ignored in
web pages other than the very first",00:28:43.420,00:28:48.040
"space bar character, or carriage return,
that you hit on the keyboard.",00:28:48.040,00:28:51.530
"If you want more line breaks, you
have to specify it yourself.",00:28:51.530,00:28:55.370
"&gt;&gt; So I'm going to do a few things
here to show what's going on.",00:28:55.370,00:28:59.080
"I'm going to add an attribute that
exists And again, the way you learn",00:28:59.080,00:29:02.700
"what attributes exist, what tags exist,
really, is online references.",00:29:02.700,00:29:07.110
"HTML is the sort of language-- it's
not a programming language.",00:29:07.110,00:29:09.750
"It's a markup language-- that after a
good half hour, maybe, an hour with",00:29:09.750,00:29:12.460
"it, you'll certainly grasp, most
likely, the basic idea.",00:29:12.460,00:29:15.930
"And then a Google search away is all
the possible tags that you might be",00:29:15.930,00:29:20.350
interested in.,00:29:20.350,00:29:21.170
"And per the spec, that is quite
welcome and encouraged here.",00:29:21.170,00:29:24.290
"&gt;&gt; So now let me go ahead and
do something like this.",00:29:24.290,00:29:26.120
Background-color.,00:29:26.120,00:29:28.690
"And now, I'm going to do something
like red, semicolon.",00:29:28.690,00:29:32.060
"And you can do this in
a few different ways.",00:29:32.060,00:29:33.970
"I'm just kind of typing it as super
explicitly as possible.",00:29:33.970,00:29:36.770
"&gt;&gt; But it turns out that this value here is
what's called CSS, Cascading Style",00:29:36.770,00:29:41.960
"Sheets, which is another
language altogether.",00:29:41.960,00:29:43.700
"CSS has nothing to do with
open tags and close tags.",00:29:43.700,00:29:46.770
It has to do with properties.,00:29:46.770,00:29:48.230
"&gt;&gt; And properties are simply key value
pairs, which just means some word,",00:29:48.230,00:29:52.660
"colon, and then some other word.",00:29:52.660,00:29:54.680
"And if you have multiple ones, or just
one here, you can end it with a",00:29:54.680,00:29:57.940
"semicolon, just for clarity.",00:29:57.940,00:29:59.390
"But that, too, will work here.",00:29:59.390,00:30:01.370
&gt;&gt; Now what's this going to do?,00:30:01.370,00:30:02.500
You can probably guess.,00:30:02.500,00:30:03.610
Let me go ahead and reload this page.,00:30:03.610,00:30:05.930
And now it's really coming along.,00:30:05.930,00:30:07.300
So top of my page is red.,00:30:07.300,00:30:09.150
"But what's key here is that, I mentioned
earlier, that div gives you",00:30:09.150,00:30:12.380
a division of the page.,00:30:12.380,00:30:13.220
And that's indeed what it does.,00:30:13.220,00:30:14.410
"It essentially divides the page into
a rectangle that you can then",00:30:14.410,00:30:17.920
manipulate.,00:30:17.920,00:30:18.720
"&gt;&gt; And this notion of rectangles is kind of
compelling in that, if you think of",00:30:18.720,00:30:22.330
"most any website, there's probably
some structure to it.",00:30:22.330,00:30:26.410
"Most of you have probably rarely seen
Facebook's homepage if you're logged",00:30:26.410,00:30:29.620
in all the time.,00:30:29.620,00:30:30.440
"&gt;&gt; But on Facebook's home page, there's
some kind of div along the top.",00:30:30.440,00:30:33.920
"And it might not be as simple
as one div, but there's a",00:30:33.920,00:30:36.140
rectangular region there.,00:30:36.140,00:30:37.560
"The rest of the page is like
a huge div, like a much",00:30:37.560,00:30:40.290
bigger rectangular region.,00:30:40.290,00:30:41.910
"So long story short, just by having
these little building blocks, the",00:30:41.910,00:30:44.540
"ability to model things as rectangles,
whether wide or narrow, you can also",00:30:44.540,00:30:49.250
"make columns potentially, allows you to
lay out pages, really, however you",00:30:49.250,00:30:53.680
would like.,00:30:53.680,00:30:54.100
"We're really just scratching
the surface here.",00:30:54.100,00:30:56.170
"&gt;&gt; Indeed, if I do one other one,
let me go ahead and do style,",00:30:56.170,00:30:59.820
"background-color, we'll do something
like blue, close quotes.",00:30:59.820,00:31:05.410
Let's reload this.,00:31:05.410,00:31:06.620
So now it's getting even uglier.,00:31:06.620,00:31:08.260
"But now I can kind of show off
my P set five skills, right?",00:31:08.260,00:31:11.520
Red.,00:31:11.520,00:31:12.690
"It reminds me of RGB, Red
Green Blue triples.",00:31:12.690,00:31:15.640
"Well, it turns out in web programming,
or web design, which is this, we've",00:31:15.640,00:31:19.330
"not yet programmed anything
per se, you can actually",00:31:19.330,00:31:21.650
have hexadecimal code.,00:31:21.650,00:31:22.880
"So something something, something
something, something something.",00:31:22.880,00:31:26.480
"So you can have six hexadecimal
characters, or three, in some cases,",00:31:26.480,00:31:30.650
"and each of those question marks
has to be a hexadecimal digits,",00:31:30.650,00:31:33.480
zero through f.,00:31:33.480,00:31:34.985
"&gt;&gt; If I want to have a lot of red, and
no green, and no blue, what's the",00:31:34.985,00:31:41.000
opposite of zero when using hex?,00:31:41.000,00:31:43.740
It's f.,00:31:43.740,00:31:44.480
"So I can do ff, zero zero, zero zero,
save this, and now come down here.",00:31:44.480,00:31:51.130
And I don't actually see a change.,00:31:51.130,00:31:52.700
"So quote unquote ""red"" is apparently
synonymous for all red,",00:31:52.700,00:31:56.230
"no green, no blue.",00:31:56.230,00:31:57.610
"Meanwhile, let's deliberately change
this one to be something",00:31:57.610,00:31:59.960
"random, like ABCDF.",00:31:59.960,00:32:01.210
&gt;&gt; Let's see what that is.,00:32:03.790,00:32:05.860
"It's a really nice blue,
actually, baby blue.",00:32:05.860,00:32:08.530
"All right, so these are just now
somewhat random combinations of",00:32:08.530,00:32:11.820
characters.,00:32:11.820,00:32:12.210
So we won't get bogged down in here.,00:32:12.210,00:32:13.410
"But again, this speaks to the precision
that you can begin to",00:32:13.410,00:32:15.930
"apply-- even if you're very overwhelmed
by the aesthetics.",00:32:15.930,00:32:19.090
"In fact, if you really want to be
impressed, let me go ahead and change",00:32:19.090,00:32:21.750
"the font size, for instance.",00:32:21.750,00:32:23.500
"And notice the semicolon, which
is necessary there.",00:32:23.500,00:32:25.960
"&gt;&gt; Font size, we can be just ridiculous
here, 96 point.",00:32:25.960,00:32:29.570
Save that.,00:32:29.570,00:32:31.280
"Wow, that's a big font size.",00:32:31.280,00:32:33.670
"All right, so it's very easy.",00:32:33.670,00:32:35.490
"And actually, you're essentially seeing
the very first web page I made",00:32:35.490,00:32:38.260
"years ago, when I first
learned this stuff.",00:32:38.260,00:32:40.060
"It's very easy to make very
hideous things quickly.",00:32:40.060,00:32:42.190
"&gt;&gt; And if you're familiar with the Wayback
Machine on archive.org, you",00:32:42.190,00:32:46.115
"can find all my hideous
undergrad web pages.",00:32:46.115,00:32:48.210
One had Kermit the Frog on the front.,00:32:48.210,00:32:50.090
"I went through a phase where I thought
it was cool to take the background of",00:32:50.090,00:32:53.150
"a red curtain, when I learned how you
can tile images again, and again, and",00:32:53.150,00:32:56.320
"again, to fill a page with
a big tacky red curtain.",00:32:56.320,00:32:59.540
"And then, on top of this, was an icon
that you had to click to enter my home",00:32:59.540,00:33:03.120
"page because that was
very much in vogue.",00:33:03.120,00:33:04.960
"&gt;&gt; And then my first program I ever wrote
wasn't in PHP, but in a language",00:33:04.960,00:33:08.870
"called Pearl, wrote a guest book, which
is a really cool thing that a",00:33:08.870,00:33:12.260
"lot of people expect you
to have on a home page.",00:33:12.260,00:33:14.250
"When you get to the page, they want you
to sign in, and say who you are,",00:33:14.250,00:33:17.510
and why you're there.,00:33:17.510,00:33:18.720
This is very 1990s style web design.,00:33:18.720,00:33:21.320
"&gt;&gt; But these days, surely, we've
come a lot farther.",00:33:21.320,00:33:24.130
"And you'll see, in section, and even
in the problem set seven, by",00:33:24.130,00:33:27.560
"leveraging libraries these days,
it's so much easier to make",00:33:27.560,00:33:31.570
prettier things quickly.,00:33:31.570,00:33:33.400
"Really here, we're just scratching
the surface of what you can do",00:33:33.400,00:33:36.550
stylistically.,00:33:36.550,00:33:37.400
"&gt;&gt; And in fact, already, let me emphasize
that this is already getting ugly, not",00:33:37.400,00:33:41.660
"just aesthetically, but in terms
of style of my code, or the",00:33:41.660,00:33:46.030
design of my code.,00:33:46.030,00:33:47.260
"I have currently comingled HTML, which
is the greenish open tags there, with",00:33:47.260,00:33:52.350
"CSS properties, which
is totally legit.",00:33:52.350,00:33:55.160
"This is really where the language
had its origins.",00:33:55.160,00:33:57.200
"&gt;&gt; But in the interest of clean design,
much like we started factoring stuff",00:33:57.200,00:34:01.030
"out from C files into .h files, let
me actually practice that kind of",00:34:01.030,00:34:05.370
"principle and start doing
this instead.",00:34:05.370,00:34:07.990
"Let me put a style tag up here, which
also exists in HTML, and let me",00:34:07.990,00:34:13.280
specify the following.,00:34:13.280,00:34:15.330
Let me delete this.,00:34:15.330,00:34:16.360
Background color is going to be red.,00:34:16.360,00:34:18.110
I'm going to delete this entirely.,00:34:18.110,00:34:19.800
"I'm going to get rid of the style
attribute, and I'm going to uniquely",00:34:19.800,00:34:22.580
identify this div with a word--,00:34:22.580,00:34:24.620
"arbitrarily, but reasonably, quote
unquote ""top."" And id is a special",00:34:24.620,00:34:28.750
"attribute that uniquely defines
a certain HTML element",00:34:28.750,00:34:32.530
as having that id.,00:34:32.530,00:34:33.850
"&gt;&gt; If I now want to stylized it, up here in
the head of my page, inside of the",00:34:33.850,00:34:37.969
"style tag, notice that
I can do hash top.",00:34:37.969,00:34:41.730
"And then I can put a couple of curly
braces, reminiscent of C, and then let",00:34:41.730,00:34:45.300
me paste in that stylization.,00:34:45.300,00:34:47.130
"And let me go ahead here and anticipate
where I'm going with this.",00:34:47.130,00:34:49.929
"Let me also create one
for the bottom div.",00:34:49.929,00:34:53.380
"Let me grab this hideous code from down
here, put it in here, and I'll be",00:34:53.380,00:34:58.010
"a little more anal now and stylized it
by just putting things on their own",00:34:58.010,00:35:00.770
"line, ending with semicolons.",00:35:00.770,00:35:02.540
Let me get rid of the style tag.,00:35:02.540,00:35:04.430
&gt;&gt; But I'm not done yet.,00:35:04.430,00:35:05.320
I need to do one other thing.,00:35:05.320,00:35:07.406
"Yeah, id equals quote unquote, ""bottom,""
or whatever id I want to",00:35:07.406,00:35:10.070
give that element.,00:35:10.070,00:35:11.740
"Now, let me go back over here.",00:35:11.740,00:35:13.420
And this is atrocious.,00:35:13.420,00:35:14.360
I can't deal with 96 point.,00:35:14.360,00:35:15.805
Let's do 24 point.,00:35:15.805,00:35:16.960
Or you could be more precise.,00:35:16.960,00:35:18.320
"You can actually use pixels, px, so
that you really get finer grain",00:35:18.320,00:35:21.800
control over your page.,00:35:21.800,00:35:23.220
"&gt;&gt; As an aside, that's not necessarily
the best thing if users, for",00:35:23.220,00:35:26.860
"accessibility reasons, want to
be able to increase sizes.",00:35:26.860,00:35:29.650
"So realize that there are ways of doing
things that don't necessarily",00:35:29.650,00:35:32.650
hard code everything.,00:35:32.650,00:35:34.230
"&gt;&gt; All right, so it's bigger, 24 point,
than whatever the default is.",00:35:34.230,00:35:37.220
But now it's a little cleaner.,00:35:37.220,00:35:38.630
And let me take this one step further.,00:35:38.630,00:35:40.230
"Just like the idea of header files,
notice we're one step closer to that.",00:35:40.230,00:35:47.220

inside of my page, those CSS rules.",00:35:47.220,00:35:52.000
"Why might I want to take this one step
further, remove this altogether, and",00:35:52.000,00:35:56.200
put it in a separate file?,00:35:56.200,00:35:59.860
"&gt;&gt; So I can reuse it, right?",00:35:59.860,00:36:01.070
"This is just kind of intuition
right now.",00:36:01.070,00:36:03.155
"Before, I claimed that it was just
getting ugly having the style",00:36:03.155,00:36:06.340
"attributes inside of the
divs themselves.",00:36:06.340,00:36:08.480
But just kind of think that through.,00:36:08.480,00:36:09.750

you're putting here, and here, and",00:36:09.750,00:36:13.560

called with those contents.,00:36:41.100,00:36:45.290
&gt;&gt; And let me do this.,00:36:45.290,00:36:46.680
Save this file.,00:36:51.150,00:36:51.920
"I say styles.css, arbitrary,
but conventional.",00:36:51.920,00:36:55.580
"I'll put it in John Harvard's home
directory now for simplicity.",00:36:55.580,00:36:58.770
"And what I can do in my web page is get
rid of the style tag altogether,",00:36:58.770,00:37:03.880
"and somewhat unintuitively, use a link
tag, which does not give you a link in",00:37:03.880,00:37:08.270
"the hyperlink, clickable sense, but
where I say link, href equals",00:37:08.270,00:37:13.140
styles.css.,00:37:13.140,00:37:15.120
"And the relationship that this element
has with the web page is to serve as",00:37:15.120,00:37:20.050
its style sheet.,00:37:20.050,00:37:21.280
&gt;&gt; So how did I know this?,00:37:21.280,00:37:22.670
"One, you just read the manual,
or you Google around, and you",00:37:22.670,00:37:25.950
look at various resources.,00:37:25.950,00:37:27.000
"I mean, that truly is how you pick up
techniques like this, and, consistent",00:37:27.000,00:37:30.520
"with this idea of teaching oneself new
languages, again, you'll find that",00:37:30.520,00:37:34.720
"there's only a finite number of things
to any language that, once you get",00:37:34.720,00:37:38.830
"them, you'll find that it gets
faster and faster to write.",00:37:38.830,00:37:41.310
"Indeed, learning a new programming
language is so much faster than a new",00:37:41.310,00:37:44.180
"spoken language because these things
are much smaller and much more",00:37:44.180,00:37:47.380
precisely defined.,00:37:47.380,00:37:48.820
"&gt;&gt; But I've highlighted a bit
of an anomaly here.",00:37:48.820,00:37:51.590
"Why have I highlighted this
forward slash here?",00:37:51.590,00:37:57.750
Because I have to close the tag.,00:37:57.750,00:37:59.420
I should close the tag.,00:37:59.420,00:38:00.530
"And you'll find innumerable resources
online that don't",00:38:00.530,00:38:02.750
necessarily close tags.,00:38:02.750,00:38:04.080
"And realistically, it's not strictly
necessary for technical and there are",00:38:04.080,00:38:08.770
"reasons of reality, browsers are just
fairly tolerant of mistakes in web",00:38:08.770,00:38:11.950
"pages, for better or for worse,
but mostly worse.",00:38:11.950,00:38:14.360
"&gt;&gt; So this here is just a cleaner way of
saying something stupid like this,",00:38:14.360,00:38:18.830
"where if you want to open the link tag
but close it, there's really no notion",00:38:18.830,00:38:22.330
of content for a link tag.,00:38:22.330,00:38:23.720
"It just means load this
file and put it here.",00:38:23.720,00:38:26.000
"It's like sharp include in C. You can
open and close a tag all at once",00:38:26.000,00:38:30.610
within the same tag.,00:38:30.610,00:38:31.660
And there's other examples of this.,00:38:31.660,00:38:33.520
"This is not the way to do this, but
the br tag, for line breaks, if I",00:38:33.520,00:38:37.280
"really wanted to achieve what I was
trying to before by hitting Enter, if",00:38:37.280,00:38:41.780
"I explicitly say line break, line break,
line break, line break, and",00:38:41.780,00:38:45.380
"then reload this page, now you'll notice
that bottom of the page is,",00:38:45.380,00:38:49.100
"indeed, much farther down in
the bottom of the page.",00:38:49.100,00:38:51.940
"But even that can be done much more
cleanly with CSS, and with margins,",00:38:51.940,00:38:55.840
"and with other such aesthetic
techniques.",00:38:55.840,00:38:58.120
"&gt;&gt; So for now, the takeaways are this.",00:38:58.120,00:38:59.940
"In HTML, we have these
things called tags.",00:38:59.940,00:39:02.320
"In CSS, we have these things
called properties.",00:39:02.320,00:39:04.830
"We can comingle these two languages,
either by using the style attribute,",00:39:04.830,00:39:08.700
"or the style tag, or best yet, factoring
it out altogether, as we do",00:39:08.700,00:39:14.240
in problem set 7.,00:39:14.240,00:39:17.270
"Questions, then, about the
conceptual basics here?",00:39:17.270,00:39:23.820
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I have a question.,00:39:23.820,00:39:24.740
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Oh, sorry.",00:39:24.740,00:39:25.630
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Why wasn't it colored--,00:39:25.630,00:39:28.880
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Oh, in the other tab?",00:39:28.880,00:39:31.410
This here?,00:39:31.410,00:39:32.232
"&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: No, it's like the--",00:39:32.232,00:39:33.482
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Oh, that's because
I was being sloppy.",00:39:35.330,00:39:39.480
I put the file in the wrong place.,00:39:39.480,00:39:41.350
"So if I actually put it here, and I
chmod it, all + r for styles.css, and",00:39:41.350,00:39:47.840
"now reload the page, now we
get the stylization back.",00:39:47.840,00:39:52.050
"And because the font sizes are
different, we don't see quite as much",00:39:52.050,00:39:54.530
white space.,00:39:54.530,00:39:55.010
"We instead see what's the
default is instead.",00:39:55.010,00:39:58.240
Good question.,00:39:58.240,00:40:00.050
Yes?,00:40:00.050,00:40:00.846
"&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Why is the link
tag inside the header?",00:40:00.846,00:40:02.630
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Why is the links
tag inside of the header--",00:40:02.630,00:40:06.270
"short answer, just because.",00:40:06.270,00:40:07.650
That is what was decided.,00:40:07.650,00:40:08.930
"That's where the link tags go when
you have what's called an",00:40:08.930,00:40:10.720
external style sheet.,00:40:10.720,00:40:13.650
Other questions?,00:40:13.650,00:40:16.430
"&gt;&gt; All right, well let's do this.",00:40:16.430,00:40:17.770
We have so much fun ahead of us today.,00:40:17.770,00:40:20.500
"That's just scratching
the surface of CSS.",00:40:20.500,00:40:22.480
Let's do this.,00:40:22.480,00:40:23.010
"Let's take a five minute break here
because, per my email, let's hang in",00:40:23.010,00:40:25.980
there till 2:30-ish today.,00:40:25.980,00:40:27.200
"But if you do have to
leave, that's fine.",00:40:27.200,00:40:28.540
"But we'll forge ahead after
a five minute break.",00:40:28.540,00:40:30.380
"And we'll learn a little something
about PHP, MySQL, and more.",00:40:30.380,00:40:35.930
"&gt;&gt; All right, so let's try, now, to tie a
few of these ideas together and make,",00:40:35.930,00:40:44.520
"say, our own search engine.",00:40:44.520,00:40:46.180
"I noticed, rather curiously,
the following.",00:40:46.180,00:40:48.570
"When you are at Google.com, you're
typically at a URL like this one here",00:40:48.570,00:40:52.610
with nothing after the dot com.,00:40:52.610,00:40:54.870
"But if I search something stupid like
cats, and hit Enter, we'll get-- not",00:40:54.870,00:40:59.760
"stupid, but you know.",00:40:59.760,00:41:01.300
"&gt;&gt; OK, so notice, at the top of the page,
now, the URL has, of course, changed.",00:41:01.300,00:41:05.410
"And this is not anything
new to any of us.",00:41:05.410,00:41:07.190
"You click links and stuff
happens on the web.",00:41:07.190,00:41:09.290
"But what's interesting here
is the following.",00:41:09.290,00:41:11.420
"There's a whole lot of clutter, but let
me throw away stuff that I don't",00:41:11.420,00:41:14.500
"quite understand or doesn't
really look relevant.",00:41:14.500,00:41:16.600
&gt;&gt; Let me get rid of this.,00:41:16.600,00:41:18.490
Let me get rid of this.,00:41:18.490,00:41:20.030
"And let me just get rid
of all of this.",00:41:20.030,00:41:22.630
"And now notice that cats is in the URL,
followed with a q, then an equal",00:41:22.630,00:41:28.840
sign in front of it.,00:41:28.840,00:41:29.710
"So it turns out this is how the
way it works when it comes",00:41:29.710,00:41:32.110
to input and output.,00:41:32.110,00:41:33.360
"&gt;&gt; We've long talked about
black boxes, right?",00:41:33.360,00:41:37.510
"So if this is a function implemented
here as a black box, it takes input",00:41:37.510,00:41:41.650
"and produces output, well, the means
by which you provide input to a",00:41:41.650,00:41:45.290
"website is by way, often, of its URLs.",00:41:45.290,00:41:49.270
"You simply put a question mark
and then a key equals value.",00:41:49.270,00:41:52.850
"And then maybe an ampersand, and then
another key equals value, then maybe",00:41:52.850,00:41:56.740
"another ampersand, key equals value.",00:41:56.740,00:41:58.810
"That's how you pass in keys and
values, pairs of inputs.",00:41:58.810,00:42:03.030
"&gt;&gt; So if I hit Enter now, what's
interesting about Google is that all",00:42:03.030,00:42:07.050
"that clutter I deleted doesn't appear
to be strictly necessary.",00:42:07.050,00:42:10.420
"All I need to send to Google is question
mark q equals cats to get",00:42:10.420,00:42:15.120
back some cats.,00:42:15.120,00:42:16.160
"Well, the implication of that, then,
is if I pull up gedit, I've started",00:42:16.160,00:42:20.160
"making my own search engine here
in a file called seach0.html.",00:42:20.160,00:42:24.360
"&gt;&gt; And let me go ahead and delete
one more line that you",00:42:24.360,00:42:26.750
weren't supposed to see.,00:42:26.750,00:42:27.910
"And now, let me go into my own browser,
so not to Google, and go to",00:42:27.910,00:42:31.070
http://localhost.,00:42:31.070,00:42:34.900
And that's going to get in the way.,00:42:34.900,00:42:36.220
"So we're going to have to say goodbye to
that for now, move this over here,",00:42:36.220,00:42:43.240
"oh, now we're going to have to
say goodbye to that file.",00:42:43.240,00:42:46.270
"&gt;&gt; Whenever you have a file called
index.html or index.php in a",00:42:46.270,00:42:51.700
"directory, if the web server is
configured in this way, what you'll",00:42:51.700,00:42:54.980
"see, by default, is the contents of that
file rather than a listing of the",00:42:54.980,00:42:59.600
"directory, as I wanted here.",00:42:59.600,00:43:02.330
More on this in the spec.,00:43:02.330,00:43:03.750
You didn't see that.,00:43:03.750,00:43:04.610
&gt;&gt; So this is what I actually wanted.,00:43:04.610,00:43:06.360
"But a moment ago, there was a
file in this folder called",00:43:06.360,00:43:08.810
index.html and index.php.,00:43:08.810,00:43:11.290
"And so the web server was
showing me those files.",00:43:11.290,00:43:13.380
"Instead, I want this directory
listing here.",00:43:13.380,00:43:15.900
"&gt;&gt; So I'm going to go into
CSS and go to search0.",00:43:15.900,00:43:18.340
"And I claim that this is it going to be
the beginning of my own competitive",00:43:18.340,00:43:21.770
search engine.,00:43:21.770,00:43:22.490
"And to do this, I'm going to go in
here, into CSS, and open up with",00:43:22.490,00:43:27.630
"gedit, search 0.",00:43:27.630,00:43:30.190
"But unfortunately, there's
not much going on here.",00:43:30.190,00:43:32.280
"All I did was use a heading tag, which
happens to be called h1, which",00:43:32.280,00:43:35.690
"essentially means big and
bold, and that's it.",00:43:35.690,00:43:38.180
"But the means by which we can
provide inputs are via these",00:43:38.180,00:43:40.810
things called forms.,00:43:40.810,00:43:42.180
"&gt;&gt; So let me go ahead and open and close,
preemptively, a form tag there.",00:43:42.180,00:43:46.040
"And let me go ahead and do
something like this.",00:43:46.040,00:43:48.060
"Input, type equals text.",00:43:48.060,00:43:51.430
"And then let's close the tag within
the brackets themselves.",00:43:51.430,00:43:56.320
"I don't need to start a text field
and stop a text field.",00:43:56.320,00:43:58.800
It's just going to be there or not.,00:43:58.800,00:44:01.080
"&gt;&gt; And then below that, let's do
input type equals submit.",00:44:01.080,00:44:06.210
Save this.,00:44:06.210,00:44:06.870
"And now let's just do a
quick sanity check.",00:44:06.870,00:44:08.630
Let's reload.,00:44:08.630,00:44:09.820
"&gt;&gt; OK, so it's not bad.",00:44:09.820,00:44:10.890
"It's not Google's style,
but it's pretty close.",00:44:10.890,00:44:13.260
There's a text field.,00:44:13.260,00:44:13.920
"I can type some stuff in, hit Enter,
but nothing happens yet.",00:44:13.920,00:44:17.190
"And that's because I haven't specified
an action for this form, so to speak.",00:44:17.190,00:44:21.090
"So if I go back to the form element,
it turns out, and I know this only",00:44:21.090,00:44:23.860
"from having read the documentation, that
the form tag takes an attribute",00:44:23.860,00:44:27.460
"called action that is the URL
of the website to which you",00:44:27.460,00:44:31.880
want to send the form.,00:44:31.880,00:44:34.790
"&gt;&gt; I don't really think we have time to
implement the whole back end for a",00:44:34.790,00:44:37.610
search engine today.,00:44:37.610,00:44:38.570
"So we're just going to say, eh,
go to google.com/search.",00:44:38.570,00:44:41.900
And now let me close my quotes.,00:44:41.900,00:44:43.450
"And let me further specify that
the method to use is going",00:44:43.450,00:44:46.070
to be called get.,00:44:46.070,00:44:47.120
"&gt;&gt; Long story short, there's two ways, at
least, that you can submit information",00:44:47.120,00:44:50.650
from browser to server.,00:44:50.650,00:44:51.880
"One is get, and, for today's purposes,
that just means in the URL.",00:44:51.880,00:44:55.340
"You see exactly the question marks, the
equals signs, and ampersands that",00:44:55.340,00:44:58.730
we saw earlier.,00:44:58.730,00:44:59.780
Or there's an alternative called post.,00:44:59.780,00:45:02.890
"For now, know that post is often used
when you want to upload files, like",00:45:02.890,00:45:06.490
"images and so forth, or when you want to
submit credit card information, or",00:45:06.490,00:45:09.820
"passwords, anything that it doesn't
really make sense, conceptually, or",00:45:09.820,00:45:13.810
"security wise, to end up in the URL of
your browser, where snooping parents,",00:45:13.810,00:45:18.020
"or roommates, or anyone with access
to your computer might see.",00:45:18.020,00:45:21.520
&gt;&gt; So let's save that here.,00:45:21.520,00:45:23.110
And I need to do one other thing.,00:45:23.110,00:45:24.480
"It doesn't suffice just to
say give me a text field.",00:45:24.480,00:45:27.250
"I have to give that field's
value a name.",00:45:27.250,00:45:29.850
"So let me borrow Google's choice of
names, q, and specify that second",00:45:29.850,00:45:34.500
"attribute I don't really care about
the name of the Submit button.",00:45:34.500,00:45:38.150
"All I care about is submitting
what the user types in.",00:45:38.150,00:45:40.890
&gt;&gt; And now this is kind of ugly.,00:45:40.890,00:45:41.940
It just says submit.,00:45:41.940,00:45:42.820
"It turns out, and I know this from the
documentation, I can actually say",00:45:42.820,00:45:46.350
"value equals quote unquote ""cs50
seach,"" close quote.",00:45:46.350,00:45:51.710
Then let's reload again.,00:45:51.710,00:45:53.030
"So I keep hitting Command-R, or
Control-R on my keyboard to reload.",00:45:53.030,00:45:57.020
"&gt;&gt; Now we have a more interesting
search engine.",00:45:57.020,00:45:58.605
"It doesn't quite look like
Google yet, though.",00:45:58.605,00:46:00.340
"So let's go ahead in here and
do a little line break.",00:46:00.340,00:46:04.100
"&gt;&gt; OK, so now we have Google.",00:46:04.100,00:46:06.066
We actually almost do have Google.,00:46:06.066,00:46:08.260
So now what's going to happen?,00:46:08.260,00:46:10.460
"I'm going to type in something
like Cats.",00:46:10.460,00:46:12.220
"And the browser is going to parse
that form that I defined.",00:46:12.220,00:46:16.570
"And it's going to send
the user to that URL.",00:46:16.570,00:46:19.470
"So this time, for some curious reason,
I got more information about stocks",00:46:19.470,00:46:23.420
than about actual cats.,00:46:23.420,00:46:24.410
"But that's fine because notice we still
ended up here, q equals cats.",00:46:24.410,00:46:30.580
"&gt;&gt; So long story short, it seems fairly
trivial to get input from the user.",00:46:30.580,00:46:35.200
"And to be fair, there's bunches
of other types of form fields.",00:46:35.200,00:46:38.190
"There's check boxes, and little mutually
exclusive radio buttons, and",00:46:38.190,00:46:41.510
"drop down menus, and more.",00:46:41.510,00:46:42.960
"But all of those are as relatively
easily implemented as",00:46:42.960,00:46:46.160
this text field was.,00:46:46.160,00:46:48.040
"And ultimately, we just have to make
sure someone is listening on the other",00:46:48.040,00:46:52.050
"end of the line in order to get that
information processed, somehow, and",00:46:52.050,00:46:56.490
give us back our cats.,00:46:56.490,00:46:58.440
"&gt;&gt; Let's look at a slightly
more involved example.",00:46:58.440,00:47:00.840
"Let me go into my Vhost's directory,
into local host, public, and where I",00:47:00.840,00:47:06.020
put today's source code.,00:47:06.020,00:47:06.980
"All of this will be on the course's
website for you to tinker with.",00:47:06.980,00:47:09.800
"And if I go into froshims, let me open
up this file now, froshim0.php.",00:47:09.800,00:47:15.420
"This one's a little more verbose, so
we won't write this from scratch.",00:47:15.420,00:47:18.460
"But just notice now a few somewhat
familiar characteristics.",00:47:18.460,00:47:21.970
"&gt;&gt; One, form tag, different action.",00:47:21.970,00:47:24.550
It's not a full URL.,00:47:24.550,00:47:25.670
"Now, it's apparently to file called
register0.php because, in a moment,",00:47:25.670,00:47:29.930
"I'm going to teach myself a little
something about PHP, a programming",00:47:29.930,00:47:32.660
"language, because PHP can be used to
implement what Google implemented as",00:47:32.660,00:47:37.360
the back end of their search engines.,00:47:37.360,00:47:39.650
"&gt;&gt; Google, in reality, probably uses
some Python, some C++, and",00:47:39.650,00:47:42.890
bunches of other languages.,00:47:42.890,00:47:44.230
"But we could certainly implement search
results using PHP if we wanted.",00:47:44.230,00:47:48.230
"But for now, we'll keep it simple.",00:47:48.230,00:47:49.610
"And this is actually reminiscent of one
of the other very first websites I",00:47:49.610,00:47:53.320
made years ago.,00:47:53.320,00:47:54.490
"&gt;&gt; Back in my day, you registered for
intramural sports as a freshman by",00:47:54.490,00:47:58.160
"filling out a piece of paper, walking
across the yard, and dropping it in",00:47:58.160,00:48:00.880
"the mailbox of a Proctor in
Wigglesworth, and that was how you",00:48:00.880,00:48:04.890
registered.,00:48:04.890,00:48:05.460
"And so my project shortly after CS50,
was to put that, which makes perfect",00:48:05.460,00:48:09.650
"sense, onto the web, which wasn't
as in vogue then as it is now.",00:48:09.650,00:48:13.460
"But all we had to do was create,
essentially, an HTML form.",00:48:13.460,00:48:17.510
"&gt;&gt; And that form looked
roughly like this.",00:48:17.510,00:48:19.640
"I had an input for the
freshman's name.",00:48:19.640,00:48:22.480
"I had another check box for whether or
or not they wanted to be captain, what",00:48:22.480,00:48:27.780
"their gender was, and
what their dorm was.",00:48:27.780,00:48:30.400
"And then I hard coded in things
like Apley Court, and Canaday,",00:48:30.400,00:48:33.370
"Grays, and so forth.",00:48:33.370,00:48:34.880
"&gt;&gt; So again, new tags.",00:48:34.880,00:48:36.300
"Haven't seen these before, new
attributes, but fairly accessible.",00:48:36.300,00:48:39.820
"Once you see an example, you can kind
of borrow that idea and make a drop",00:48:39.820,00:48:42.360
down menu for most anything.,00:48:42.360,00:48:43.820
"But what's key is that each of
these things have names.",00:48:43.820,00:48:46.350
"And at the bottom of this form, there's
a submit button whose label,",00:48:46.350,00:48:49.720
"or value, is register.",00:48:49.720,00:48:51.510
&gt;&gt; So let's go to this page.,00:48:51.510,00:48:52.670
"Let me go back into the
directory listing.",00:48:52.670,00:48:55.050
"Let me go into froshims,
and go to froshim0.php.",00:48:55.050,00:48:59.410
"So it's hideous, to be fair.",00:48:59.410,00:49:01.150
"So I could definitely stylize this
with some CSS, I could make some",00:49:01.150,00:49:03.950
"graphics, maybe add some colors,
and make this prettier.",00:49:03.950,00:49:06.890
"But functionally, I'd argue that this
is actually pretty complete.",00:49:06.890,00:49:10.530
"&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, when I fill this out,
David, Captain, Male, we'll choose,",00:49:10.530,00:49:15.190
"let's say Matthews, Register,
all that happens is this.",00:49:15.190,00:49:20.510
But notice a couple of takeaways.,00:49:20.510,00:49:21.910
"One, what file returned those
results, apparently?",00:49:21.910,00:49:27.130
"So it is, indeed, register0.php.",00:49:27.130,00:49:29.470
"So the fact that we saw that action
value a moment ago for register0, this",00:49:29.470,00:49:34.570
"corroborates that we indeed ended
up at that particular file.",00:49:34.570,00:49:37.500
&gt;&gt; Now this is just ugly text.,00:49:37.500,00:49:39.040
"But notice that this text is
coming from local host,",00:49:39.040,00:49:42.810
which is from the appliance.,00:49:42.810,00:49:44.170
"Think of the appliance now as just
a web server that could be in the",00:49:44.170,00:49:46.350
Science Center.,00:49:46.350,00:49:46.910
It could be on the actual web.,00:49:46.910,00:49:48.060
So it's publicly accessible.,00:49:48.060,00:49:49.850
"&gt;&gt; So clearly, there's some way of passing
form field inputs to a server",00:49:49.850,00:49:55.480
so that it can do something with them.,00:49:55.480,00:49:56.840
"Unfortunately, register0
is pretty stupid.",00:49:56.840,00:49:59.020
"All it does is print out an array
that looks like this.",00:49:59.020,00:50:01.870
"And it's not an array in the
sense that we know it.",00:50:01.870,00:50:04.790
"Turns out that PHP, and a lot of
languages, have not only numerically",00:50:04.790,00:50:08.760
"indexed arrays whose first index is
zero, then one, then two, then dot,",00:50:08.760,00:50:12.350
"dot, dot, n minus 1.",00:50:12.350,00:50:13.780
"&gt;&gt; This is what's called an
associative array.",00:50:13.780,00:50:16.400
"An associative array is one in which
you can store key value pairs where",00:50:16.400,00:50:21.150
the key is not necessarily a number.,00:50:21.150,00:50:23.160
"It could in fact be a string, a word.",00:50:23.160,00:50:25.580
"And so this can be implemented,
underneath the hood, it turns out,",00:50:25.580,00:50:28.230
using a data structure known as a?,00:50:28.230,00:50:31.896
"Thought something dramatic
was about to happen--",00:50:31.896,00:50:33.600
hash table.,00:50:33.600,00:50:34.840
"&gt;&gt; So a hash table, recall, those of you
who did it for P set 6, or even recall",00:50:34.840,00:50:38.955
"it, at least even if you did a try, a
hash table, in our usage, was used to",00:50:38.955,00:50:44.110
just store words.,00:50:44.110,00:50:45.090
"But really, you were storing
keys and values.",00:50:45.090,00:50:47.980
"If you implemented a hash table for P
set 6 dictionary, the keys were the",00:50:47.980,00:50:51.940
"words themselves, and the values
were effectively true or false.",00:50:51.940,00:50:56.890
"Yes, here, or implicitly,
no, not here.",00:50:56.890,00:51:00.190
"&gt;&gt; Well, we can generalize that idea.",00:51:00.190,00:51:02.140
"And we could use a very similar data
structure to store not the string",00:51:02.140,00:51:06.230
"itself alone in your hash table, but
suppose that in every one of your hash",00:51:06.230,00:51:10.180
table's nodes.,00:51:10.180,00:51:11.130
"And you could even do this in a try
rather than just have a bool.",00:51:11.130,00:51:14.210
You could have something else.,00:51:14.210,00:51:15.350
"What if the key was not maxwell, for
instance, but quote unquote ""name,"" or",00:51:15.350,00:51:19.590
"quote unquote ""captain."" And inside of
your C data structure, you put a",00:51:19.590,00:51:22.900
"value, not just a Boolean, but of value
like quote unquote ""David,"" or",00:51:22.900,00:51:26.170
"""M,"" or ""Matthews,"" and so forth.",00:51:26.170,00:51:28.690
"&gt;&gt; So those same data structures we used
apparently exist in other languages.",00:51:28.690,00:51:33.170
"And I'd argue they're actually much,
much simpler to access here.",00:51:33.170,00:51:37.650
"Let's in fact take a look
now at some such syntax.",00:51:37.650,00:51:40.300
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go into a PHP directory.,00:51:40.300,00:51:43.120
"And I'm going to open up a better
version of hello-0 from before.",00:51:43.120,00:51:48.390
"Notice that all I did was
add some comments.",00:51:48.390,00:51:50.270
So we can get rid of that distraction.,00:51:50.270,00:51:52.530
"&gt;&gt; And this program does indeed prints
hello because I've specified between",00:51:52.530,00:51:57.610
tags that I want to execute that code.,00:51:57.610,00:52:01.420
"Now, we'll see in a moment
why this is useful.",00:52:01.420,00:52:03.380
But let's open one other example here.,00:52:03.380,00:52:05.630
"Let me go ahead and open up say,
gedit of conditions one.",00:52:05.630,00:52:10.430
&gt;&gt; This is way back in time now.,00:52:10.430,00:52:12.970
"But weeks ago, I think, in week one or
week two, we had an example called",00:52:12.970,00:52:16.320
conditions1.c.,00:52:16.320,00:52:18.470
"And I decided to reimplement it in PHP,
just to kind of emphasize that",00:52:18.470,00:52:22.050
"PHP, syntactically, is almost identical
to C. This isn't a huge leap",00:52:22.050,00:52:26.500
from last week to this.,00:52:26.500,00:52:27.840
"&gt;&gt; Notice at the top of this program, which
begins, as before, with some",00:52:27.840,00:52:31.230
"comments, which I'll get rid
of as a distraction.",00:52:31.230,00:52:34.260
"Notice that I'm in PHP
mode in this file.",00:52:34.260,00:52:37.410
"So this code, we'll see,
will get executed.",00:52:37.410,00:52:40.160
"Notice that there's readline,
which is probably the",00:52:40.160,00:52:42.670
analog in PHP of getstring.,00:52:42.670,00:52:46.230
Notice it's a little different.,00:52:46.230,00:52:47.390
"You actually specify a prompt to the
function called read line, and that's",00:52:47.390,00:52:51.410
what the user sees.,00:52:51.410,00:52:52.180
So you don't have to printf manually.,00:52:52.180,00:52:53.520
But that's not a big deal.,00:52:53.520,00:52:54.860
"I'm going to store, inside of $n, the
return value of this, so whatever the",00:52:54.860,00:52:59.150
user types in is their int.,00:52:59.150,00:53:00.490
And here's another curiosity.,00:53:00.490,00:53:01.660
"It turns out, in PHP, any variable
just has to be prefixed",00:53:01.660,00:53:05.810
with a dollar sign.,00:53:05.810,00:53:06.970
It's a little annoying.,00:53:06.970,00:53:08.110
But notice what I haven't done in PHP.,00:53:08.110,00:53:10.870
"What's missing from the left hand
side of the equals sign?",00:53:10.870,00:53:13.980
&gt;&gt; No mention of type.,00:53:13.980,00:53:15.430
"So this is different from C. For better
or for worse, PHP is a loosely",00:53:15.430,00:53:19.400
typed language.,00:53:19.400,00:53:20.550
It does have numbers.,00:53:20.550,00:53:22.010
It does have strings.,00:53:22.010,00:53:23.240
It does have Booleans.,00:53:23.240,00:53:24.015
"And it does have a few
other data types.",00:53:24.015,00:53:26.220
"But you, the programmer, usually
don't have to care about them.",00:53:26.220,00:53:30.570
"The upside of this is that it makes
it a little easier to program.",00:53:30.570,00:53:34.010
You can think a little less.,00:53:34.010,00:53:35.380
"The downside is it also opens you up to
potential bugs if you accidentally",00:53:35.380,00:53:39.840
"treat a number as a string, a string
as a number, potentially, but even",00:53:39.840,00:53:43.080
"then, PHP, and a lot of languages,
are pretty tolerant.",00:53:43.080,00:53:46.150
"They will use what's called
implicit casting.",00:53:46.150,00:53:49.050
"And if you try to use n in the context
of a numeric situation, it will",00:53:49.050,00:53:55.220
"convert what here is going to be a
string, because if the user types",00:53:55.220,00:53:58.040
"something in, and you get the result,
as with readline, or get string,",00:53:58.040,00:54:01.570
that's going to return a string.,00:54:01.570,00:54:02.910
"&gt;&gt; But notice, a couple lines later, I
check if n is greater than zero.",00:54:02.910,00:54:07.360
"So PHP is going to implicitly cast my
""string"" 123, or whatever the user",00:54:07.360,00:54:13.370
"types in, into an int.",00:54:13.370,00:54:14.860
"So in short, stuff just works
a lot more intuitively.",00:54:14.860,00:54:18.730
"So we now begin to relax a few of the
things that we've done in the past.",00:54:18.730,00:54:23.410
"&gt;&gt; A lot of this stuff is
the same, though.",00:54:23.410,00:54:24.780
Still have equals equals.,00:54:24.780,00:54:26.340
"As an aside PHP also has equals equals
equals, but more on that, perhaps, in",00:54:26.340,00:54:30.350
the future.,00:54:30.350,00:54:30.850
That was a.,00:54:30.850,00:54:31.150
"Typo but two equals signs means the same
thing as before, for comparison.",00:54:31.150,00:54:35.660
printf means the same thing as before.,00:54:35.660,00:54:37.060
"Backslash n means the same
thing as before.",00:54:37.060,00:54:39.160
&gt;&gt; So how do I run this program?,00:54:39.160,00:54:40.390
"Well, as before, if I do PHP,
conditions1.php, and type in",00:54:40.390,00:54:44.400
a number like 123.,00:54:44.400,00:54:46.560
That's a positive number.,00:54:46.560,00:54:47.720
"If I type in 0, I pick 0.",00:54:47.720,00:54:49.510
"And if I type in negative 123, I get
back a negative number, which is only",00:54:49.510,00:54:53.700
"to say, syntactically, PHP
is super, super similar.",00:54:53.700,00:54:59.050
"&gt;&gt; So why is this now useful
in a web context?",00:54:59.050,00:55:03.250
"Well, let's go back to this froshims
example, which looked,",00:55:03.250,00:55:06.710
"again, like this here.",00:55:06.710,00:55:08.600
"And let's actually pull up the web page
again, which looked like this.",00:55:08.600,00:55:11.580
"What can we do with the
data that's submitted?",00:55:11.580,00:55:14.930
"&gt;&gt; Well, let me open up a newer
version of this.",00:55:14.930,00:55:18.770
"And you'll see that the problem
sets specification walks you",00:55:18.770,00:55:20.920
through a few of these.,00:55:20.920,00:55:22.850
"Rather than start with zero,
let's look at froshims3,",00:55:22.850,00:55:29.610
which does a bit more.,00:55:29.610,00:55:31.410
"&gt;&gt; Notice first, actually, let's open
up what 0 was, so you see",00:55:31.410,00:55:34.780
what register 0 was.,00:55:34.780,00:55:37.170
Notice what register 0 did.,00:55:37.170,00:55:40.040
"One, I have comments at the top.",00:55:40.040,00:55:41.730
Delete those and focus only on this.,00:55:41.730,00:55:43.900
"Most of the contents of register0.php
are, obviously, what language?",00:55:43.900,00:55:48.730
Just raw PHP.,00:55:48.730,00:55:49.980
"&gt;&gt; So notice, this file does not start
with, at the moment, open bracket,",00:55:49.980,00:55:53.430
"question mark, PHP.",00:55:53.430,00:55:54.970
"PHP does allow you to intermingle
PHP code with HTML tags.",00:55:54.970,00:55:59.800
"But I've done that here inside
of the page over here.",00:55:59.800,00:56:04.130
"&gt;&gt; Now, again, you'd only know this from
having looked at the manual. print_r,",00:56:04.130,00:56:08.180
"it turns out, is print_recursive.
_recursive And this is just a handy",00:56:08.180,00:56:13.410
"utility function that just prints out,
recursively, whatever you hand it.",00:56:13.410,00:56:16.780
"If you hand it an array,
it'll print an array.",00:56:16.780,00:56:18.760
"If you hand it a number,
it'll print a number.",00:56:18.760,00:56:20.180
"Hand it a string, it'll
print a string.",00:56:20.180,00:56:21.570
"If you hand it a hash table, it
will print out a hash table.",00:56:21.570,00:56:24.500
"You don't have to write all
of that code yourself.",00:56:24.500,00:56:26.730
"&gt;&gt; Now notice that I'm entering
PHP mode over here.",00:56:26.730,00:56:29.490
I'm exiting PHP mode over here.,00:56:29.490,00:56:32.070
"So when the web server reads this file
top to bottom, left to right, because",00:56:32.070,00:56:35.950
"it ends in a filename called .php,
whatever's not inside of PHP tags is",00:56:35.950,00:56:40.750
"just going to be spit
out, like raw HTML.",00:56:40.750,00:56:42.820
No big deal.,00:56:42.820,00:56:43.630
"But as soon as the web server notices
this, it's going to say, I should not",00:56:43.630,00:56:49.280
"spit out, literally, print_r of post.",00:56:49.280,00:56:51.850
"I should execute the following
line of code.",00:56:51.850,00:56:54.910
"&gt;&gt; So the last question, then, of this file
is, well, what the heck is this?",00:56:54.910,00:56:59.850
Take a guess.,00:56:59.850,00:57:00.530
"What is $_POST, probably?",00:57:00.530,00:57:04.230
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:57:04.230,00:57:07.070
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Yeah, the posted data.",00:57:07.070,00:57:08.830
"Recall, let's scroll back in
time for just a moment.",00:57:08.830,00:57:11.350
"froshim0, again, looked like this.",00:57:11.350,00:57:13.165
A super majority of this is just HTML.,00:57:13.165,00:57:15.640
"Again, some tags you haven't
seen yet, or with which",00:57:15.640,00:57:18.410
you are already familiar.,00:57:18.410,00:57:19.360
But the interesting thing was this.,00:57:19.360,00:57:21.990
"This one line is what really links
it to our register0.php file.",00:57:21.990,00:57:27.270
I'm submitting via method post.,00:57:27.270,00:57:29.200
"And that means that the parameters
the user types in are not",00:57:29.200,00:57:33.130
going to end up where.,00:57:33.130,00:57:35.150
"&gt;&gt; They're not going to
show up in the URL.",00:57:35.150,00:57:36.175
"They are still going to be sent from the
client, from the browser, to the",00:57:36.175,00:57:39.020
"server, but just via some other
mechanism that we'll waive our hands",00:57:39.020,00:57:42.080
"at for today, but it's not in the URL.",00:57:42.080,00:57:44.330
"But notice the relationship now with
post, which, by convention, is",00:57:44.330,00:57:47.630
lowercase here.,00:57:47.630,00:57:49.160
"&gt;&gt; But if I open up register0.php,
I'm apparently printing this.",00:57:49.160,00:57:54.090
"So this is kind of a weird
naming convention.",00:57:54.090,00:57:56.450
"But what's nice in PHP is that when
using PHP in a web context, not at a",00:57:56.450,00:58:01.430
"command line like I did a moment ago,
when you're actually using it in a web",00:58:01.430,00:58:04.480
"page, in a Vhost directory as we are,
automatically will PHP fill this",00:58:04.480,00:58:10.580
"thing, which is an associative array,
so to speak, a hash table, with",00:58:10.580,00:58:15.560
everything the user typed in.,00:58:15.560,00:58:17.290
"&gt;&gt; In short, $_POST in all caps is a
global variable that PHP just",00:58:17.290,00:58:22.000
"magically creates for you when
using PHP in a web context.",00:58:22.000,00:58:25.050
"And it puts inside of it all of the
names of parameters in the form that",00:58:25.050,00:58:29.160
"was submitted to this file and all of
the values that the user typed in.",00:58:29.160,00:58:33.200
"So it hands to you what the user
typed in to that form.",00:58:33.200,00:58:37.790
"&gt;&gt; So before, we got really stupid output
of just seeing this because all I did",00:58:37.790,00:58:42.210
was recursively print this array.,00:58:42.210,00:58:44.400
"The key is name, the value is David.",00:58:44.400,00:58:46.060
The key is Captain.,00:58:46.060,00:58:46.980
The value is on.,00:58:46.980,00:58:47.970
"And the double arrow and the angle
bracket there, this is just arbitrary.",00:58:47.970,00:58:52.300
This is not code.,00:58:52.300,00:58:53.270
"This is just PHP's way of showing you
what the value of some key is.",00:58:53.270,00:58:57.690
"&gt;&gt; But now let me propose that in
froshIMs3, it's almost identical",00:58:57.690,00:59:03.000
except it submits to this file.,00:59:03.000,00:59:04.950
"And again, we're going to kind of just
glance at this, just to see some",00:59:04.950,00:59:08.570
"syntax, but notice what
this file does.",00:59:08.570,00:59:12.040
"Take a guess just based on the lines of
code, which probably do look like",00:59:12.040,00:59:14.930
"Greek, to some extent,
is apparently doing.",00:59:14.930,00:59:17.410
"&gt;&gt; This file is somehow related
to mail, email.",00:59:20.580,00:59:23.110
So what is this program doing?,00:59:23.110,00:59:24.770
"In this version, if I were to actually
fill out this form-- and let me go to",00:59:24.770,00:59:28.740
"froshIMs3, not froshIMs0--",00:59:28.740,00:59:30.760
the form looks the same.,00:59:33.280,00:59:34.540
"David, captain, male, dorm, Matthews.",00:59:34.540,00:59:37.980
"But if I submit this, this file is
going to go to register3.php.",00:59:37.980,00:59:42.980
"&gt;&gt; And I claim, by looking at it's
source code, it's going to",00:59:42.980,00:59:46.330
somehow involve email.,00:59:46.330,00:59:47.650
"Let me go ahead and open this
up in a bigger window, so we",00:59:47.650,00:59:49.620
can see it more cleanly.,00:59:49.620,00:59:51.030
"We're in Vhosts, local host,
public, froshims.",00:59:51.030,00:59:57.220
"I'm going to open up a different
program, just so we",00:59:57.220,00:59:58.680
can see more at once.,00:59:58.680,01:00:00.160
"&gt;&gt; So now here, notice a few things.",01:00:00.160,01:00:03.100
"At the top of the file is open
bracket, question mark, PHP.",01:00:03.100,01:00:06.530
"Then there's a bunch of comments,
which we can ignore, is",01:00:06.530,01:00:08.920
uninteresting for now.,01:00:08.920,01:00:10.450
&gt;&gt; Now there's this.,01:00:10.450,01:00:11.300
"It turns out PHP has a lot
of code called require.",01:00:11.300,01:00:14.200
"It's very similar in spirit to C's
include, hash include, which",01:00:14.200,01:00:19.110
"essentially grabs the contents of some
other file and just plops them here,",01:00:19.110,01:00:21.980
so you can use them.,01:00:21.980,01:00:22.930
"In this case, the appliance has,
pre-installed, a library, free and",01:00:22.930,01:00:27.060
"open source library called PHP
mailer that anyone can",01:00:27.060,01:00:29.900
download from the internet.,01:00:29.900,01:00:30.770
We just did it for you.,01:00:30.770,01:00:32.000
"And this means I now have email
functionality at my disposal.",01:00:32.000,01:00:36.130
"&gt;&gt; Now, notice a few things.",01:00:36.130,01:00:38.170
"I'm going to validate the
form's submission.",01:00:38.170,01:00:41.120
"Turns out PHP, one, has exclamation
points for the not operator, just like",01:00:41.120,01:00:45.980
"C. But PHP also has a function
called empty.",01:00:45.980,01:00:49.810
"&gt;&gt; Empty just returns true if the value
of the thing you hand it in",01:00:49.810,01:00:53.920
"parentheses is empty, like the
user didn't type anything in.",01:00:53.920,01:00:57.190
"So this is saying, and notice the
syntax, very reminiscent of C, if the",01:00:57.190,01:01:02.680
"name key, so the name field in the form,
which was submitted via post, by",01:01:02.680,01:01:07.730
"the user, is not to empty, and their
gender is not empty in the form as",01:01:07.730,01:01:13.010
"well, and their dorm is not empty--",01:01:13.010,01:01:15.980
"but notice I don't care about Captain,
then what are we going to do?",01:01:15.980,01:01:19.980
"&gt;&gt; I'm going to execute
this line of code.",01:01:19.980,01:01:21.990
"And you can think of this kind of
like malloc, but it's a little",01:01:21.990,01:01:24.100
fancier than that.,01:01:24.100,01:01:24.800
"But for now this gives me a special
struct of type PHP mailer.",01:01:24.800,01:01:29.200
But ignore the keyword new for today.,01:01:29.200,01:01:31.410
"&gt;&gt; Now I'm going to call a function called
IsSMTP, which says, use SMTP.",01:01:31.410,01:01:35.670
"This is port 25, just like the video
last week, when the thing was throwing",01:01:35.670,01:01:39.380
emails into the firewall.,01:01:39.380,01:01:40.710
Port 25 is SMTP.,01:01:40.710,01:01:42.440
SMTP means use the mail server.,01:01:42.440,01:01:44.410
"Which one, we can use Harvard's
SMTP.fas.harvard.edu.",01:01:44.410,01:01:46.215
"&gt;&gt; We can set the from address
to be John Harvard's.",01:01:48.850,01:01:51.590
"If I scroll down further, I can set
the recipient address, just",01:01:51.590,01:01:55.090
"arbitrarily, to be John
Harvard's as well.",01:01:55.090,01:01:56.840
So he's going to be emailing himself.,01:01:56.840,01:01:59.210
"&gt;&gt; Now I can set the subject
to be registration.",01:01:59.210,01:02:01.600
"And I can set the body
of email as follows.",01:02:01.600,01:02:03.700
"This line looks a little more cryptic,
but that's just because there's a lot",01:02:03.700,01:02:06.500
of information in it.,01:02:06.500,01:02:07.450
"One, there's a dot operator.",01:02:07.450,01:02:10.670
"Someone must know already what
the dot operator does.",01:02:10.670,01:02:14.510
It's concatenation.,01:02:14.510,01:02:15.436
"So if you want to take a string in PHP,
and append it, or prepend it, to",01:02:15.436,01:02:19.240
"another string in PHP, thank God you
don't have to use strcopy and malloc,",01:02:19.240,01:02:23.500
and all of that anymore.,01:02:23.500,01:02:25.490
"&gt;&gt; If you want to concatenate two strings,
who cares about the memory.",01:02:25.490,01:02:28.765
Let PHP figure that out for you.,01:02:28.765,01:02:30.850
"What PHP will do with the dot operator
here is just make a big sentence out",01:02:30.850,01:02:35.200
"of this line, this line,
this line, this line.",01:02:35.200,01:02:37.900
"And now notice, it's going
to be plugging in values.",01:02:37.900,01:02:40.460
"So the email that John Harvard's going
to receive is literally going to say",01:02:40.460,01:02:43.680
"name, colon, something, rather, then we
close the string and concatenate on",01:02:43.680,01:02:49.450
"whatever the user typed
in, then a new line.",01:02:49.450,01:02:52.220
"&gt;&gt; Then, on the next line of John Harvard's
email, it's going to say",01:02:52.220,01:02:54.570
"Captain, On or Nothing.",01:02:54.570,01:02:55.910
"It's going to say gender,
male or female.",01:02:55.910,01:02:57.810
"Dorm is going to be Matthews
in my case.",01:02:57.810,01:02:59.680
"And then notice familiar semicolon
at the very end.",01:02:59.680,01:03:03.400
"And then, down here, notice, somewhat
cryptic still, but again, following a",01:03:03.400,01:03:07.830
"pattern that will become more familiar
after P set 7, if sending the mail",01:03:07.830,01:03:12.730
"returns false, then go ahead and die.",01:03:12.730,01:03:16.610
"&gt;&gt; So PHP has a function called die,
which, literally, just kills the",01:03:16.610,01:03:19.610
"website and just prints out whatever
you tell it-- its is dying",01:03:19.610,01:03:22.830
"words, so to speak.",01:03:22.830,01:03:24.280
"And that, in the case, it will print
out what the error info is for",01:03:24.280,01:03:28.310
whatever happened to go wrong.,01:03:28.310,01:03:29.860
"So long story short here, what we have
is an example where when the user",01:03:29.860,01:03:34.490
"submits the form, froshim0,
froshims3.php, it goes to",01:03:34.490,01:03:39.150
register3.php.,01:03:39.150,01:03:40.760
"But register3.php then proceeds
to execute all of these lines.",01:03:40.760,01:03:45.290
&gt;&gt; So there's a few take aways here.,01:03:45.290,01:03:46.620
"One, it's apparently fairly easy,
programmatically, to send emails,",01:03:46.620,01:03:50.380
which is good.,01:03:50.380,01:03:50.830
"When users register for your site, in
this case, when they register for your",01:03:50.830,01:03:53.500
"sport, you can email the freshman
Proctor, or John",01:03:53.500,01:03:56.220
"Harvard, in this case.",01:03:56.220,01:03:57.650
&gt;&gt; But it also means you can do what?,01:03:57.650,01:04:01.630
Send emails from anyone to anyone.,01:04:01.630,01:04:03.970
And this is very true.,01:04:03.970,01:04:05.430
"This is not as easily done if
you're used to using Gmail.",01:04:05.430,01:04:08.580
"But if you've ever used Eudora or
Outlook, you can pretty much tell a",01:04:08.580,01:04:11.310
"mail server that you are
anyone you want.",01:04:11.310,01:04:13.720
"And this is where I need to put on
that hat and say, don't do this.",01:04:13.720,01:04:16.450
"But this is testament to just how easy
it is to perform phishing attacks, and",01:04:16.450,01:04:21.140
"send anonymous emails, and
spam, more generally.",01:04:21.140,01:04:24.310
"And it really boils down to the
fact that all you need is some",01:04:24.310,01:04:27.330
programmatic access.,01:04:27.330,01:04:28.500
"&gt;&gt; As an aside, my closest encounter with
the ad board, my own freshman year,",01:04:28.500,01:04:31.940
"was when I discovered this cool
trick that, wow, you can",01:04:31.940,01:04:34.320
send emails from anyone.,01:04:34.320,01:04:36.850
"And so we were having some stupid
argument, literally, in Matthews,",01:04:36.850,01:04:39.770
among my Proctor group.,01:04:39.770,01:04:40.790
"I don't even remember
what the issue was.",01:04:40.790,01:04:42.470
"But I wanted to try to put an
end to this stupid debate.",01:04:42.470,01:04:44.970
"&gt;&gt; So I decided I will just send an email
to my Proctor group, pretending to be",01:04:44.970,01:04:48.580
"the other guy, with whose opinion I
disagreed, and have him acquiesce to",01:04:48.580,01:04:52.000
"whatever my opinion was in
this particular debate.",01:04:52.000,01:04:54.680

technique similar in spirit to this.",01:04:54.680,01:04:59.320
"But it was actually easier
at the time.",01:04:59.320,01:05:01.256
Hit send.,01:05:01.256,01:05:02.435
"He was not pleased, nor would
have been the ad board.",01:05:02.435,01:05:06.660
"&gt;&gt; And I was very quickly caught within
seconds because, as you know, I sign",01:05:06.660,01:05:10.280
my emails in a certain way.,01:05:10.280,01:05:11.420
"And though I do it manually, in large
part, 15 years later because I was",01:05:11.420,01:05:14.200
traumatized by that.,01:05:14.200,01:05:15.080
"I don't have a signature
on my email now.",01:05:15.080,01:05:16.960

Proctor group, I acquiesce my opinion",01:05:20.440,01:05:24.630

so, new line, new line, DJM.",01:05:24.630,01:05:31.240

your final project, when making a",01:05:36.220,01:05:39.950

"leverage other services on the internet

send things using code.,01:05:47.000,01:05:49.440
&gt;&gt; So how can we improve upon this?,01:05:49.440,01:05:51.240
"Well, first let's take a quick tour of
some of the things that you'll see,",01:05:51.240,01:05:54.370
"and then take a look at
a couple of examples.",01:05:54.370,01:05:56.170
"So one, to reassure, because
we're flying through PHP.",01:05:56.170,01:05:59.500
"And I know, at some point, you'll have
to actually start writing this if you",01:05:59.500,01:06:02.470
haven't already.,01:06:02.470,01:06:03.460
"Realize that, one, main is kind
of out the window with PHP.",01:06:03.460,01:06:06.220
"If you want to write code that gets
executed, you just start writing it in",01:06:06.220,01:06:09.420
"a file called .php so long as
you have the open bracket",01:06:09.420,01:06:13.970
question mark PHP tag.,01:06:13.970,01:06:15.620
"&gt;&gt; But notice these are
conditions in php.",01:06:15.620,01:06:19.730
"Notice, this is the exact same slide
we had in week one when we had",01:06:19.730,01:06:22.610
"conditions in C. Conditions in
PHP are structurally and",01:06:22.610,01:06:25.670
syntactically the same.,01:06:25.670,01:06:27.140
"Only real difference is if you've got
variables involved, you have those",01:06:27.140,01:06:30.290
dollar signs.,01:06:30.290,01:06:31.600
"&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Boolean expressions
look just like this for",01:06:31.600,01:06:33.970
or-ing or and-ing together.,01:06:33.970,01:06:35.725
Switches look exactly the same.,01:06:35.725,01:06:37.780
"What's nice in PHP, whereas in C,
switches have to be cases on",01:06:37.780,01:06:42.180
"primitives like ints or chars, in PHP
your case statements can actually be",01:06:42.180,01:06:46.380
"on a whole strings, which is
actually kind of nice.",01:06:46.380,01:06:48.430
Saves you some time.,01:06:48.430,01:06:49.480
Couldn't do that in C.,01:06:49.480,01:06:50.820
&gt;&gt; Here's a for loop in PHP.,01:06:50.820,01:06:52.880
It's identical.,01:06:52.880,01:06:53.740
"Might have some dollar signs
for the variables.",01:06:53.740,01:06:55.400
"You don't have to mention that
something is an int.",01:06:55.400,01:06:57.530
"You just declare it with a dollar sign
and the name of the variable.",01:06:57.530,01:07:00.580
But a for loop is the same.,01:07:00.580,01:07:01.430
A while loop is the same.,01:07:01.430,01:07:02.760
A do while loop is the same.,01:07:02.760,01:07:04.870
&gt;&gt; This is a little different.,01:07:04.870,01:07:06.170
"So with PHP, with an array, you can
statically declare an array, as in C,",01:07:06.170,01:07:12.410
but you use square brackets.,01:07:12.410,01:07:14.420
"In C, you would use curly braces,
if you even knew that.",01:07:14.420,01:07:17.060
"But this is actually very common in PHP
to declare an array, in this case,",01:07:17.060,01:07:20.910
"of numbers, and call the
variable numbers.",01:07:20.910,01:07:23.640
&gt;&gt; Variables themselves look like this.,01:07:23.640,01:07:25.300
"Here is a string, quote unquote ""hello
world."" You could have a backslash n.",01:07:25.300,01:07:28.710
I simply don't in this case.,01:07:28.710,01:07:30.950
&gt;&gt; Now this is an interesting construct.,01:07:30.950,01:07:32.640
C does not have this.,01:07:32.640,01:07:33.700
But this is super helpful.,01:07:33.700,01:07:34.700
"And you'll see this in P set 7
spec-- a for each construct.",01:07:34.700,01:07:38.160
"If you want to reiterate over all of the
elements an array, you don't have",01:07:38.160,01:07:41.800
"to deal with $i and $n,
and ++, and all that.",01:07:41.800,01:07:45.500
"You can literally say, in PHP, this--",01:07:45.500,01:07:47.640
"for each numbers as number, so
I'm assuming that $numbers",01:07:47.640,01:07:51.890
is an array of numbers.,01:07:51.890,01:07:53.380
"And when I say for each numbers
as number, this is going to",01:07:53.380,01:07:56.460
"automatically, as my loop executes,
update, on each iteration, the value",01:07:56.460,01:08:00.505
inside of dollar sign number--,01:08:00.505,01:08:03.260
"again, and again, and again walking
for me over that array.",01:08:03.260,01:08:07.730
So it just saves us code.,01:08:07.730,01:08:08.735
"No semicolons, no ++'s, no i's,
no n's, it's just nice.",01:08:08.735,01:08:12.250
&gt;&gt; But PHP also has this.,01:08:12.250,01:08:13.700
And this is super powerful.,01:08:13.700,01:08:14.830
"And you'll use this, hands
on, in P set 7.",01:08:14.830,01:08:17.410
"And associative array is also declared
with square brackets.",01:08:17.410,01:08:21.990
But notice the syntax now.,01:08:21.990,01:08:23.569
"It's reminiscent of what we saw
with print_r a moment ago.",01:08:23.569,01:08:26.880
"How many keys, as a little sanity check,
does this array seem to have.",01:08:26.880,01:08:31.810
&gt;&gt; So it has two.,01:08:31.810,01:08:32.689
And I call this an array.,01:08:32.689,01:08:33.830
"But if it helps, you can think
of this as hash table, or as",01:08:33.830,01:08:36.760
an associative array.,01:08:36.760,01:08:37.930
"But it is just a different
type of array.",01:08:37.930,01:08:39.580
"And again, different languages
have these.",01:08:39.580,01:08:41.080
"We'll see something similar
in JavaScript as well.",01:08:41.080,01:08:43.810
There's two keys.,01:08:43.810,01:08:44.609
"One is quote unquote, ""symbol,"" one is
quote unquote ""price."" And those keys",01:08:44.609,01:08:48.390
each have a value.,01:08:48.390,01:08:49.250
"In this case symbol's value is FB, for
Facebook, and price's value is 49, 26,",01:08:49.250,01:08:54.420
"which was Facebook's stock
price as of this morning.",01:08:54.420,01:08:56.899
"&gt;&gt; So what is useful about
an associative array.",01:08:56.899,01:09:00.170
"I could have had a numerically
indexed array with just",01:09:00.170,01:09:02.620
simple square brackets.,01:09:02.620,01:09:04.120
"And I could have had dollar sign
quote equals just this.",01:09:04.120,01:09:09.380
Let me actually do it.,01:09:09.380,01:09:10.529
"Suppose I instead just declared
this array like that.",01:09:10.529,01:09:14.796
"That is perfectly valid,
syntactically.",01:09:14.796,01:09:17.590
"It doesn't lose any information,
per se.",01:09:17.590,01:09:20.569
"I still see that the symbol is fb,
and that the price is 49, 26.",01:09:20.569,01:09:24.760
"So why are associative
arrays compelling?",01:09:24.760,01:09:28.939
"&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: You don't have to remember
where you put stuff.",01:09:28.939,01:09:30.189
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Exactly, you don't have
to remember where you put stuff.",01:09:32.050,01:09:34.130
"You don't have to arbitrarily remember
that stock symbol is in bracket zero,",01:09:34.130,01:09:37.670
"and stock prices is in bracket one,
which is particularly dangerous if you",01:09:37.670,01:09:41.479
"change things, eventually.",01:09:41.479,01:09:43.220
"It's much nicer to associate
what we'll call metadata",01:09:43.220,01:09:46.399
with your actual data.,01:09:46.399,01:09:48.340
"I'd argue that what we really care
about here is fb and 49, 26.",01:09:48.340,01:09:52.399
"The symbol and price is metadata
that describes the data we",01:09:52.399,01:09:57.020
actually care about.,01:09:57.020,01:09:58.180
"But this is just so much
easier to access.",01:09:58.180,01:10:01.910
"&gt;&gt; Now, as an aside what's
the price we pay?",01:10:01.910,01:10:04.090
"We've been doing this
in CS50 for weeks.",01:10:04.090,01:10:06.600
This feature must come at some cost.,01:10:06.600,01:10:10.740
Memory.,01:10:10.740,01:10:11.350
"So you're not just storing a 32-bit
integer, for instance.",01:10:11.350,01:10:13.830
"You're storing symbol/0, probably.",01:10:13.830,01:10:17.980
So you're using more memory.,01:10:17.980,01:10:19.160
"&gt;&gt; And what's the performance of
looking something up in an",01:10:19.160,01:10:22.540
"associative array, probably?",01:10:22.540,01:10:24.822
It's probably slower.,01:10:24.822,01:10:26.590
"Random access is nice, especially
when you can do binary search.",01:10:26.590,01:10:29.670
"But if you're actually now looking not
for numbers, but for strings, this",01:10:29.670,01:10:33.380
"truly is implemented underneath the
hood, probably as a hash table, where",01:10:33.380,01:10:37.630
"you use either a hash table
with separate chaining.",01:10:37.630,01:10:42.950
"Or you use a try to actually
store the values.",01:10:42.950,01:10:46.040
"So maybe you can do constant time, but
you still have to look at S-Y-M-B-O-L,",01:10:46.040,01:10:50.550
"potentially, instead of just 32
bits to look something up.",01:10:50.550,01:10:54.510
"So again, those same ideas coming
back to recur in this context.",01:10:54.510,01:10:58.430
"&gt;&gt; But again, PHP now has some super
globals that, it turns out, are",01:10:58.430,01:11:02.120
associative arrays.,01:11:02.120,01:11:02.900
"We saw one a moment ago, $_POST.",01:11:02.900,01:11:05.590
"And that super global
has keys and values.",01:11:05.590,01:11:08.400
"Specifically, the keys
line up with what?",01:11:08.400,01:11:10.550
Where do the keys in $_POST come from?,01:11:10.550,01:11:14.520
Just to recap?,01:11:14.520,01:11:15.380
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Name.,01:11:15.380,01:11:16.480

&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],01:11:17.900,01:11:19.860
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Name is the attribute.,01:11:19.860,01:11:20.750
"Well where, where did they
originally come from?",01:11:20.750,01:11:23.480
The form.,01:11:23.480,01:11:24.120
"So if an HTML page has a form tag,
inside of which are some inputs, like",01:11:24.120,01:11:30.140
"check boxes, text boxes, drop down
menus, each of which has a name, those",01:11:30.140,01:11:34.760
"names end up as keys in $_POST, and,
frankly, for that matter, $_GET.",01:11:34.760,01:11:40.260
"If the method is get, same idea.",01:11:40.260,01:11:42.130
It's just in a different super global.,01:11:42.130,01:11:43.830
"And the values, of course, come from
whatever the user typed in at his or",01:11:43.830,01:11:47.620
her browser.,01:11:47.620,01:11:48.890
&gt;&gt; But there's a few others.,01:11:48.890,01:11:49.830
"There's cookie, which we'll
come back to eventually.",01:11:49.830,01:11:52.140
"But those are the things that you know
the web uses for some good or evil.",01:11:52.140,01:11:56.050
But we'll come back to that.,01:11:56.050,01:11:57.420
"Server and session, and those two
have some special utility.",01:11:57.420,01:12:01.720
&gt;&gt; But let's take a look at this.,01:12:01.720,01:12:03.940
"Let me go ahead and open up an example
called mvc0.php So MVC",01:12:03.940,01:12:13.330
stands for the following.,01:12:13.330,01:12:14.900
"And we introduce this earlier than is
typical, really, to get you designing",01:12:14.900,01:12:19.390
"Problem set 7, and also final projects,
in sort of an industry",01:12:19.390,01:12:22.180
"standard way, and clean way.",01:12:22.180,01:12:23.670
It's good design.,01:12:23.670,01:12:24.820
"&gt;&gt; So you're about to see, and you'll
experience, in P set 7, paradigm, sort",01:12:24.820,01:12:29.090
"of a programming mindset, that looks
a little something like this.",01:12:29.090,01:12:32.260
"M for Model, C for Controller,
V for View.",01:12:32.260,01:12:35.570
"Long story short, MVC is just kind
of a methodology, a way of making",01:12:35.570,01:12:39.690
"websites, in particular, whereby you
put all of your, stupid phrase--",01:12:39.690,01:12:43.360
business logic--,01:12:43.360,01:12:44.970
"all of your intellectual property in
what's called a controller, a file",01:12:44.970,01:12:49.710
"like index.php, or we'll see,
quote.php, or buy.php.",01:12:49.710,01:12:54.840
"&gt;&gt; In the context of Problem set 7, your
models typically contain your data,",01:12:54.840,01:12:59.570
"anything related to a database, as we'll
eventually see, and your views",01:12:59.570,01:13:03.860
"contain the aesthetics of your
site, the HTML, the CSS.",01:13:03.860,01:13:07.510
"So we already saw this in C a little
bit by using .h files.",01:13:07.510,01:13:10.420
"We really saw it a moment ago with CSS,
by factoring the CSS stylization",01:13:10.420,01:13:15.010
stuff out of our HTML.,01:13:15.010,01:13:16.520
"&gt;&gt; So MVC is really just about drawing
lines in the sand and saying, the",01:13:16.520,01:13:20.730
"interesting programming code for your
website belongs in what we'll call the",01:13:20.730,01:13:25.400
controller.,01:13:25.400,01:13:26.400
"Stuff related to database typically
ends up in a model.",01:13:26.400,01:13:29.280
"But you'll see, in Problem set 7, we
merge C and M to keep it simple.",01:13:29.280,01:13:33.070
"But view is where all of your HTML
and aesthetics typically go.",01:13:33.070,01:13:37.630
&gt;&gt; So what does this mean in real terms?,01:13:37.630,01:13:39.160
"Well, let me go into our MVC
directory as follows.",01:13:39.160,01:13:45.980
"And you'll see more of these
toured through in the spec.",01:13:45.980,01:13:48.880
"So in mvc0, I claim that this is, like,
version 0 of CS50's websites.",01:13:48.880,01:13:53.200
"&gt;&gt; All we have is some HTML, like
a big h1 tag, apparently.",01:13:53.200,01:13:56.670
And then a bulleted list.,01:13:56.670,01:13:57.800
"I've never seen a bulleted list
before, but no big deal.",01:13:57.800,01:13:59.860
Let's quickly look at the source code.,01:13:59.860,01:14:01.590
"Turns out an unordered list with bullets
is open bracket ul with one or",01:14:01.590,01:14:06.610
"more list items, li.",01:14:06.610,01:14:09.065
So notice here is an anchor tag.,01:14:09.065,01:14:10.650
We saw that a moment ago.,01:14:10.650,01:14:12.130

this page.",01:14:12.130,01:14:13.810
"I've got two links, two list items, one

pretty website, version 0 here.",01:14:18.460,01:14:22.700
"But what's interesting now is how this
is implemented underneath the hood.",01:14:22.700,01:14:26.840
"&gt;&gt; Let me go into gedit and open up this
very first example to paint a picture.",01:14:26.840,01:14:33.590
"And we'll look at what's flawed,
potentially, in here.",01:14:33.590,01:14:37.070
"Now if I go into localhost, public,
MVC, notice a few files.",01:14:37.070,01:14:43.260
"I'm going to call these, for the
moment, all controllers.",01:14:43.260,01:14:45.780
"But that's a bit of an abuse because
you'll see everything's commingled",01:14:45.780,01:14:48.640
inside of them.,01:14:48.640,01:14:49.620
&gt;&gt; And let me go inside of index.php.,01:14:49.620,01:14:52.330
"And we see, literally, the same HTML.",01:14:52.330,01:14:54.700
"So even though this file ends in
.php, It doesn't mean it has to",01:14:54.700,01:14:57.970
have any PHP code.,01:14:57.970,01:14:59.500
"It can just be raw HTML, although
that's kind of silly.",01:14:59.500,01:15:02.290
"But notice there's no open bracket PHP
tag, except for this, which, frankly,",01:15:02.290,01:15:07.650
is just there to serve as a comment.,01:15:07.650,01:15:09.160
"But that's functionally not
even that interesting.",01:15:09.160,01:15:12.080
&gt;&gt; But notice this.,01:15:12.080,01:15:12.960
"What's interesting now is what
changes on this page.",01:15:12.960,01:15:15.400
Let me click Lectures.,01:15:15.400,01:15:16.650
And notice the URL is about to change.,01:15:16.650,01:15:18.560
Now I'm at lectures.php.,01:15:18.560,01:15:20.930
Let me click zero.,01:15:20.930,01:15:22.630
"Now I'm at week0.php And now let
me open these files in gedit.",01:15:22.630,01:15:27.200
"Not just index, but let
me open up lectures.",01:15:27.200,01:15:30.120
"And let me get rid of the comments
to focus on this part only.",01:15:30.120,01:15:33.900
"&gt;&gt; And now let me open up just one more,
week0.php, throw away the comments,",01:15:33.900,01:15:37.680
just to clean this up.,01:15:37.680,01:15:39.910
And now notice the following.,01:15:39.910,01:15:41.720
"Thinking really sort of carefully about
design, and let's make it line",01:15:41.720,01:15:47.340
"up the same, what could be done
better here, do you think?",01:15:47.340,01:15:52.013
&gt;&gt; How did I make a week one?,01:15:56.450,01:15:57.780
How about this.,01:15:57.780,01:15:58.480
So this is how I made week one.,01:15:58.480,01:16:00.450
"I went up to File, New, Paste, Save,
week1.php, and then I went in here.",01:16:00.450,01:16:08.290
And I changed one--,01:16:08.290,01:16:09.875
"what was this, one to Friday.",01:16:09.875,01:16:11.646
I changed the zeros to one.,01:16:14.430,01:16:15.810
I changed this to one.,01:16:15.810,01:16:17.150
"&gt;&gt; OK, so now look at my files.",01:16:17.150,01:16:20.350
What could be done differently?,01:16:20.350,01:16:22.100
"Where's the opportunity, perhaps?",01:16:22.100,01:16:25.310
"So there's the opportunity to start
factoring this stuff out.",01:16:25.310,01:16:28.330
"Let me open up, as a spoiler, for
what you'll see in P set 7.",01:16:28.330,01:16:32.950
"If I open up, now, index.php in version
five of this, it looks way",01:16:32.950,01:16:38.750
"more cryptic, admittedly.",01:16:38.750,01:16:40.730
"&gt;&gt; But this, now, is what I'll call a
controller that's controlling the",01:16:40.730,01:16:43.710
logic of my page.,01:16:43.710,01:16:44.770
"And you can kind of reconstruct,
intuitively, perhaps, what's going on.",01:16:44.770,01:16:48.510
"On the first line, it's
a little cryptic.",01:16:48.510,01:16:50.630
"But notice I'm requiring, like with
sharp include, a file called",01:16:50.630,01:16:54.040
helpers.php.,01:16:54.040,01:16:55.930
"And then I'm calling, apparently, a
function, called render, passing in",01:16:55.930,01:16:59.980
two arguments.,01:16:59.980,01:17:00.850
"&gt;&gt; One is quote unquote, header.",01:17:00.850,01:17:02.440
"And the other is, what kind of
data type is this, based",01:17:02.440,01:17:04.800
on our syntax earlier?,01:17:04.800,01:17:07.180
It's an associated array.,01:17:07.180,01:17:08.160
"Specifically, it's passing in the title
with some metadata that reminds",01:17:08.160,01:17:11.730
me what it is and its value.,01:17:11.730,01:17:13.430
"Then I see a hard coded
ul, so some raw HTML.",01:17:13.430,01:17:16.340
"But then I'm back in PHP mode
calling a function render.",01:17:16.340,01:17:20.020
"So even if you've never used HTML or PHP
before, and even though this looks",01:17:20.020,01:17:24.390
"scarier, why is this probably
better design?",01:17:24.390,01:17:27.480
"What's better about it,
based on inference?",01:17:27.480,01:17:31.310
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],01:17:31.310,01:17:32.130
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Less redundant in that
there's no more HTML tag, no more",01:17:32.130,01:17:35.750
"heads tag, no more body tag
in every damn file.",01:17:35.750,01:17:38.410
"Instead, I've factored out the
commonalities and presumably put them",01:17:38.410,01:17:41.860
"into a file somehow related
to a header.",01:17:41.860,01:17:45.150
"And same thing for the close body
tag, the close HTML tag.",01:17:45.150,01:17:48.500
"That's probably down here inside
of the footer somewhere.",01:17:48.500,01:17:52.165
"And you'll see, in Problem set 7,
a little tour through this.",01:17:52.165,01:17:57.050
&gt;&gt; So what lies ahead?,01:17:57.050,01:17:58.070
"The one thing we haven't the ability
yet for is to actually store data.",01:17:58.070,01:18:03.390
"And so what we'll start to see
Wednesday, for instance, is that your",01:18:03.390,01:18:06.110
"old friend Excel, or numbers,
allows you to store lots of",01:18:06.110,01:18:08.450
data in rows and columns.,01:18:08.450,01:18:10.060
"Turns out you can do that in what's
called a database, programmatically.",01:18:10.060,01:18:12.570
"manic And it turns out, after that,
we'll be able to store things like",01:18:12.570,01:18:16.620
"this, which you'll see again in P set
7, a whole bunch of usernames and",01:18:16.620,01:18:20.550
"passwords, the latter of which are
actually encrypted, much like they",01:18:20.550,01:18:23.690
were in P set 2's hacker edition.,01:18:23.690,01:18:25.550
"And eventually, you'll implement this,
your own eTrade-like website that",01:18:25.550,01:18:29.600
implements collectively CS50 finance.,01:18:29.600,01:18:32.220

give you not only advice, at the SCES",01:18:36.000,01:18:41.120
