PROFESSOR: OK.,00:00:21.580,00:00:23.630
"Now, today we get to move on
from integral formulas and",00:00:23.630,00:00:29.220
"methods of integration back
to some geometry.",00:00:29.220,00:00:34.620
"And this is more or less going
to lead into the kinds of",00:00:34.620,00:00:38.290
"tools you'll be using in
multivariable calculus.",00:00:38.290,00:00:43.120
"The first thing that we're going
to do today is discuss",00:00:43.120,00:00:46.510
arc length.,00:00:46.510,00:00:58.220
"Like all of the cumulative sums
that we've worked on,",00:00:58.220,00:01:02.940
"this one has a storyline and the
picture associated to it,",00:01:02.940,00:01:06.710
"which involves dividing
things up.",00:01:06.710,00:01:09.360
"If you have a roadway, if you
like, and you have mileage",00:01:09.360,00:01:12.650
"markers along the road, like
this, all the way up to, say,",00:01:12.650,00:01:19.400
"sn here, then the length along
the road is described by this",00:01:19.400,00:01:28.060
"parameter, s.",00:01:28.060,00:01:30.560
Which is arc length.,00:01:30.560,00:01:32.930
"And if we look at a graph of
this sort of thing, if this is",00:01:32.930,00:01:38.080
"the last point b, and this is
the first point a, then you",00:01:38.080,00:01:42.390
"can think in terms of having
points above x1, x2, x3, etc.",00:01:42.390,00:01:50.460
"The same as we did with
Riemann sums.",00:01:50.460,00:01:53.940
"And then the way that we're
going to approximate this is",00:01:53.940,00:02:00.710
"by taking the straight lines
between each of these points.",00:02:00.710,00:02:09.470
"As things get smaller and
smaller, the straight line is",00:02:09.470,00:02:12.260
"going to be fairly close
to the curve.",00:02:12.260,00:02:15.210
And that's the main idea.,00:02:15.210,00:02:16.980
"So let me just depict one
little chunk of this.",00:02:16.980,00:02:20.050
Which is like this.,00:02:20.050,00:02:20.900
"One straight line, and here's
the curved surface there.",00:02:20.900,00:02:24.530
"And the distance along the
curved surface is what I'm",00:02:24.530,00:02:26.940
"calling delta s, the change in
the length between, so this",00:02:26.940,00:02:32.000
"would be s2 - s1 if I
depicted that one.",00:02:32.000,00:02:34.920
"So this would be delta s is,
say s. si - si - 1, some",00:02:34.920,00:02:43.170
increment there.,00:02:43.170,00:02:45.240
"And then I can figure out what
the length of the orange",00:02:45.240,00:02:50.500
segment is.,00:02:50.500,00:02:51.750
"Because the horizontal
distance is delta x.",00:02:51.750,00:02:54.630
"And the vertical distance
is delta y.",00:02:54.630,00:02:57.290
"And so the formula is that the
hypotenuse is delta x ^2 +",00:02:57.290,00:03:04.390
delta y ^2.,00:03:04.390,00:03:06.470
Square root.,00:03:06.470,00:03:09.420
"And delta s is approximately
that.",00:03:09.420,00:03:11.870
"So what we're saying is
that delta s ^2 is",00:03:11.870,00:03:13.980
approximately this.,00:03:13.980,00:03:16.370
So this is the hypotenuse.,00:03:16.370,00:03:21.870
Squared.,00:03:21.870,00:03:23.500
"And it's very close to the
length of the curve.",00:03:23.500,00:03:29.520
"And the whole idea of calculus
is in the infinitesimal, this",00:03:29.520,00:03:35.120
is exactly correct.,00:03:35.120,00:03:44.150
"So that's what's going to
happen in the limit.",00:03:44.150,00:03:48.010
"And that is the basis for
calculating arc length.",00:03:48.010,00:03:52.000
"I'm going to rewrite that
formula on the next board.",00:03:52.000,00:03:56.060
"But I'm going to write it in
the more customary fashion.",00:03:56.060,00:03:59.460
"We've done this before,
a certain amount.",00:03:59.460,00:04:02.200
"But I just want to emphasize
it here because this",00:04:02.200,00:04:04.460
"handwriting is a little
bit peculiar.",00:04:04.460,00:04:09.390
"This ds is really
all one thing.",00:04:09.390,00:04:11.710
"What I really mean is to put
the parenthesis around it.",00:04:11.710,00:04:15.690
It's one thing.,00:04:15.690,00:04:16.660
"It's not d * s, it's ds.",00:04:16.660,00:04:19.070
It's one thing.,00:04:19.070,00:04:20.020
And we square it.,00:04:20.020,00:04:20.940
"But for whatever reason people
have gotten into the habit of",00:04:20.940,00:04:23.940
omitting the parentheses.,00:04:23.940,00:04:26.650
"So you're just going to have
to live with that.",00:04:26.650,00:04:28.070
"And realize that this is not d
of s ^2 or anything like that.",00:04:28.070,00:04:31.050
"And similarly, this is a single
number, and this is a",00:04:31.050,00:04:33.470
single number.,00:04:33.470,00:04:34.130
Infinitesimal.,00:04:34.130,00:04:36.060
"So that's just the way that this
idea here gets written in",00:04:36.060,00:04:41.300
our notation.,00:04:41.300,00:04:42.350
"And this is the first time we're
dealing with squares of",00:04:42.350,00:04:44.710
infinitesimals.,00:04:44.710,00:04:46.070
"So it's just a little
different.",00:04:46.070,00:04:47.600
"But immediately the first thing
we're going to do is",00:04:47.600,00:04:49.490
take the square root.,00:04:49.490,00:04:51.750
"If I take the square root,
that's the square root of dx",00:04:51.750,00:04:55.780
^2 + dy ^2.,00:04:55.780,00:04:58.640
"And this is the form
in which I always",00:04:58.640,00:05:00.640
remember this formula.,00:05:00.640,00:05:02.400
"Let's put it in some brightly
decorated form.",00:05:02.400,00:05:07.030
"But there are about 4, 5, 6
other forms that you'll derive",00:05:07.030,00:05:13.200
"from this, which all mean
the same thing.",00:05:13.200,00:05:16.110
"So this is, as I say, the
way I remember it.",00:05:16.110,00:05:18.520
"But there are other ways
of thinking of it.",00:05:18.520,00:05:20.270
"And let's just write a
couple of them down.",00:05:20.270,00:05:23.070
"The first one is that you
can factor out the dx.",00:05:23.070,00:05:27.380
So that looks like this.,00:05:27.380,00:05:29.480
1 + (dy / dx)^2.,00:05:29.480,00:05:34.680
"And then I factored
out the dx.",00:05:34.680,00:05:37.630
So this is a variant.,00:05:37.630,00:05:39.820
"And this is the one which
actually we'll be using in",00:05:39.820,00:05:43.780
"practice right now
on our examples.",00:05:43.780,00:05:47.490
"So the conclusion is that the
arc length, which if you like",00:05:47.490,00:05:57.260
"is this total sn - s0, if you
like, is going to be equal to",00:05:57.260,00:06:06.800
"the integral from a to b
of the square root of 1",00:06:06.800,00:06:13.180
+ (dy / dx)^2 dx.,00:06:13.180,00:06:20.490
"In practice, it's also
very often written",00:06:20.490,00:06:26.680
informally as this.,00:06:26.680,00:06:29.090
The integral ds.,00:06:29.090,00:06:30.750
"So the change in this little
variable s, and this is what",00:06:30.750,00:06:34.490
"you'll see notationally
in many textbooks.",00:06:34.490,00:06:40.410
"So that's one way of writing it,
and of course the second",00:06:40.410,00:06:42.430
"way of writing it which is
practically the same thing is",00:06:42.430,00:06:45.950
"square root of 1 +
f ' ( x^2) dx.",00:06:45.950,00:06:50.040
"Mixing in a little bit
of Newton's notation.",00:06:50.040,00:06:52.330
And this is with y = f (x).,00:06:52.330,00:06:57.250
"So this is the formula
for arc length.",00:06:57.250,00:07:03.310
"And as I say, I remember
it this way.",00:07:03.310,00:07:05.770
"But you're going to have to
derive various variants of it.",00:07:05.770,00:07:09.060
"And you'll have to use
some arithmetic to",00:07:09.060,00:07:11.120
get to various formulas.,00:07:11.120,00:07:12.650
And there will be more later.,00:07:12.650,00:07:15.190
"Yeah, question.",00:07:15.190,00:07:16.030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:07:16.030,00:07:20.820
"PROFESSOR: OK, the question is,
is f ' (x)^2 = f '' (x).",00:07:20.820,00:07:27.350
And the answer is no.,00:07:27.350,00:07:31.020
And let's just see what it is.,00:07:31.020,00:07:33.090
"So, for example, if f ( x) = x
^2, which is an example which",00:07:33.090,00:07:39.360
"will come up in a few minutes,
then f ' (x) = 2x and f ' ( x",00:07:39.360,00:07:46.450
")^2 = = (2x), which is 4x ^2.",00:07:46.450,00:07:52.380
"Whereas f '' ( x) is equal to,
if I differentiate this",00:07:52.380,00:07:56.180
"another time, it's equal to 2.",00:07:56.180,00:07:58.750
"So they don't mean
the same thing.",00:07:58.750,00:08:03.440
The same thing over here.,00:08:03.440,00:08:04.700
"You can see this dy / dx, this
is the rate of change of y",00:08:04.700,00:08:07.360
with respect to x.,00:08:07.360,00:08:08.190
The quantity squared.,00:08:08.190,00:08:09.780
"So in other words, this
thing is supposed to",00:08:09.780,00:08:11.400
mean the same as that.,00:08:11.400,00:08:13.450
Yeah.,00:08:13.450,00:08:13.800
Another question.,00:08:13.800,00:08:19.580
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:08:19.580,00:08:25.660
"PROFESSOR: So the question is,
you got a little nervous",00:08:25.660,00:08:28.850
"because I left out
these limits.",00:08:28.850,00:08:30.430
"And indeed, I did that on
purpose because I didn't want",00:08:30.430,00:08:32.800
to specify what was going on.,00:08:32.800,00:08:34.530
"Really, if you wrote it in terms
of ds, you'd have to",00:08:34.530,00:08:37.230
"write it as starting at s0 and
ending at sn to be consistent",00:08:37.230,00:08:40.760
with the variable s.,00:08:40.760,00:08:42.180
"But of course, if you write it
in terms of another variable,",00:08:42.180,00:08:45.730
you put that variable in.,00:08:45.730,00:08:46.940
"So this is what we do when we
change variables, right?",00:08:46.940,00:08:48.990
"We have many different choices
for these limits.",00:08:48.990,00:08:51.570
"And this is the clue as to
which variable we use.",00:08:51.570,00:08:54.530
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:08:54.530,00:08:59.060
"PROFESSOR: Correct. s0 and
sn are not the same",00:08:59.060,00:09:02.180
thing as a and b.,00:09:02.180,00:09:03.310
"In fact, this is xn.",00:09:03.310,00:09:05.290
"And this x0, over here.",00:09:05.290,00:09:07.740
That's what a and b are.,00:09:07.740,00:09:08.990
"But s0 and sn are mileage
markers on the road.",00:09:08.990,00:09:13.250
"They're not the same thing as
keeping track of what's",00:09:13.250,00:09:15.450
happening on the x axis.,00:09:15.450,00:09:16.950
"So when we measure arc length,
remember it's mileage along",00:09:16.950,00:09:20.240
the curved path.,00:09:20.240,00:09:27.980
"So now, I need to give
you some examples.",00:09:27.980,00:09:32.410
"And my first example is going
to be really basic.",00:09:32.410,00:09:40.820
"But I hope that it helps to give
some perspective here.",00:09:40.820,00:09:45.630
"So I'm going to take the example
y = m x, which is a",00:09:45.630,00:09:49.560
"linear function, a
straight line.",00:09:49.560,00:09:52.550
"And then y ' would = m, and so
ds is going to be the square",00:09:52.550,00:09:58.630
root of 1 + (y ') ^2 dx.,00:09:58.630,00:10:02.650
"Which is the square root
of 1 + m ^2 dx.",00:10:02.650,00:10:10.840
"And now, the length, say, if
we go from, I don't know,",00:10:10.840,00:10:17.700
"let's say 0 to 10, let's say.",00:10:17.700,00:10:24.990
"Of the graph is going to be the
integral from 0 to 10 of",00:10:24.990,00:10:29.620
"the square root of
1 + m ^2 dx.",00:10:29.620,00:10:33.990
"Which of course is just 10
square root of 1 + m ^2.",00:10:33.990,00:10:39.910
Not very surprising.,00:10:39.910,00:10:41.810
This is a constant.,00:10:41.810,00:10:43.360
"It just factors out and
the integral from 0",00:10:43.360,00:10:45.570
to 10 of dx is 10.,00:10:45.570,00:10:51.210
"Let's just draw a
picture of this.",00:10:51.210,00:10:54.340
"This is something which
has slope m here.",00:10:54.340,00:10:57.530
And it's going to 10.,00:10:57.530,00:10:59.020
So this horizontal is 10.,00:10:59.020,00:11:02.340
And the vertical is 10 m.,00:11:02.340,00:11:05.930
"Those are the dimensions
of this.",00:11:05.930,00:11:08.030
"And the Pythagorean theorem says
that the hypotenuse, not",00:11:08.030,00:11:12.050
"surprisingly, let's draw it in
here in orange to remind",00:11:12.050,00:11:15.530
"ourselves that it was the same
type of orange that we had",00:11:15.530,00:11:17.840
"over there, this length
here is the square",00:11:17.840,00:11:21.850
root of 10 ^2 + (10m)^2.,00:11:21.850,00:11:27.160
"That's the formula for
the hypotenuse.",00:11:27.160,00:11:31.400
"And that's exactly
the same as this.",00:11:31.400,00:11:38.520
"Maybe you're saying duh,
this is obvious.",00:11:38.520,00:11:40.540
"But the point that I'm trying
to make is this.",00:11:40.540,00:11:44.160
"If you can figure out these
formulas for linear functions,",00:11:44.160,00:11:48.220
"calculus tells you how to do
it for every function.",00:11:48.220,00:11:52.510
"The idea of calculus is that
this easy calculation here,",00:11:52.510,00:11:56.370
"which you can do without any
calculus at all, all of the",00:11:56.370,00:12:01.100
"tools, the notations of
differentials and limits and",00:12:01.100,00:12:05.050
"integrals, is going to
make you be able to",00:12:05.050,00:12:07.430
do it for any curve.,00:12:07.430,00:12:10.040
"Because we can break things
up into these little",00:12:10.040,00:12:12.000
infinitesimal bits.,00:12:12.000,00:12:13.070
"This is the whole idea of all of
the methods that we had to",00:12:13.070,00:12:16.380
set up integrals here.,00:12:16.380,00:12:18.620
"This is the main point
of these integrals.",00:12:18.620,00:12:25.770
"Now, so let's do something
slightly more interesting.",00:12:25.770,00:12:32.480
"Our next example is going to be
the circle, so y = square",00:12:32.480,00:12:41.140
root of 1 - x ^2.,00:12:41.140,00:12:48.590
"If you like, that's the
graph of a semicircle.",00:12:48.590,00:12:51.820
"And maybe we'll set it
up here this way.",00:12:51.820,00:12:57.040
"So that the semicircle goes
around like this.",00:12:57.040,00:13:00.030
"And well start it
here at x = 0.",00:13:00.030,00:13:02.310
And we'll go over to a.,00:13:02.310,00:13:04.250
"And we'll take this little
piece of the circle.",00:13:04.250,00:13:06.560
So down to here.,00:13:06.560,00:13:08.150
If you like.,00:13:08.150,00:13:11.850
"So here's the portion of the
circle that I'm going to",00:13:11.850,00:13:16.010
measure the length of.,00:13:16.010,00:13:17.660
"Now, we know that length.",00:13:17.660,00:13:19.110
It's called arc length.,00:13:19.110,00:13:20.160
"And I'm going to give it a name,
I'm going to call it",00:13:20.160,00:13:21.760
alpha here.,00:13:21.760,00:13:23.400
"So alpha's the arc length
along the circle.",00:13:23.400,00:13:39.640
"Now, let's figure
out what it is.",00:13:39.640,00:13:42.660
"First, in order to do this,
I have to figure",00:13:42.660,00:13:44.560
out what y ' is.,00:13:44.560,00:13:45.970
"Or, if you like, dy / dx.",00:13:45.970,00:13:47.960
"Now, that's a calculation that
we've done a number of times.",00:13:47.960,00:13:50.680
"And I'm going to do it
slightly faster.",00:13:50.680,00:13:52.830
"But you remember it gives
you a square root in the",00:13:52.830,00:13:55.180
denominator.,00:13:55.180,00:13:57.160
"And then you have the derivative
of what's inside",00:13:57.160,00:14:00.070
the square root.,00:14:00.070,00:14:01.180
Which is - 2x.,00:14:01.180,00:14:02.260
"But then there's also 1/2,
because in disguise it's",00:14:02.260,00:14:05.320
really (1 - x ^2)^2 1/2.,00:14:05.320,00:14:07.840
"So we've done this calculation
enough times that I'm not",00:14:07.840,00:14:11.160
"going to carry it
out completely.",00:14:11.160,00:14:12.500
"I want you to think
about what it is.",00:14:12.500,00:14:14.290
"It turns out to - x up
here, because the",00:14:14.290,00:14:16.950
1/2 and the 2 cancel.,00:14:16.950,00:14:22.890
"And now the thing that we have
to integrate is this arc",00:14:22.890,00:14:27.410
"length element, as
it's called. ds.",00:14:27.410,00:14:30.190
"And that's going to be
the square root of",00:14:30.190,00:14:32.970
1 + (y ') ^2 dx.,00:14:32.970,00:14:38.350
"And so I'm going to have to
carry out the calculation,",00:14:38.350,00:14:41.060
some messy calculation here.,00:14:41.060,00:14:42.970
"Which is that this is 1
+ ( - x / square root",00:14:42.970,00:14:47.020
of 1 - x ^2) ^2.,00:14:47.020,00:14:49.610
"So I have to figure out what's
under the square root sign",00:14:49.610,00:14:52.410
"over here in order to carry
out this calculation.",00:14:52.410,00:14:55.740
Now let's do that.,00:14:55.740,00:14:58.570
This is 1 + x ^2 / 1 - x ^2.,00:14:58.570,00:15:03.310
"That's what this
simplifies to.",00:15:03.310,00:15:06.140
"And then that's equal
to, over a common",00:15:06.140,00:15:08.700
"denominator, (1 - x ^2).",00:15:08.700,00:15:11.190
1 - x ^2 + x^2.,00:15:11.190,00:15:13.580
"And there is a little bit
of simplification now.",00:15:13.580,00:15:16.500
Because the 2x ^2's cancel.,00:15:16.500,00:15:19.190
And we get 1 / 1 - x^2.,00:15:19.190,00:15:28.640
"So now I get to finish off the
calculation by actually",00:15:28.640,00:15:36.350
"figuring out what the
arc length is.",00:15:36.350,00:15:40.580
And what is it?,00:15:40.580,00:15:42.460
"Well, this alpha is equal
to the integral",00:15:42.460,00:15:47.630
from 0 to a of ds.,00:15:47.630,00:15:51.990
"Well, it's going to
be the square root",00:15:51.990,00:15:53.510
of what I have here.,00:15:53.510,00:15:55.110
"This was a square, this is just
what was underneath the",00:15:55.110,00:15:57.950
square root sign.,00:15:57.950,00:15:58.710
This is 1 + (y ') ^2.,00:15:58.710,00:16:01.500
"Have to take the square
root of that.",00:16:01.500,00:16:03.270
"So what I get here is dx / the
square root of 1 - x ^2.",00:16:03.270,00:16:13.350
"And now, we recognize this.",00:16:13.350,00:16:18.590
"The antiderivative of this is
something that we know.",00:16:18.590,00:16:21.100
This is the inverse sine.,00:16:21.100,00:16:23.790
Evaluated at 0 and a.,00:16:23.790,00:16:25.830
"Which is just giving us the
inverse sine of a, because the",00:16:25.830,00:16:30.380
inverse sine of 0 = 0.,00:16:30.380,00:16:35.860
"So alpha = the inverse
sine of a.",00:16:35.860,00:16:43.980
"That's a very fancy way of
saying that sine alpha = a.",00:16:43.980,00:16:51.320
"That's the equivalent
statement here.",00:16:51.320,00:16:54.870
"And what's going on here is
something that's just a little",00:16:54.870,00:17:00.150
deeper than it looks.,00:17:00.150,00:17:01.950
Which is this.,00:17:01.950,00:17:03.120
"We've just figured out a
geometric interpretation of",00:17:03.120,00:17:08.180
what's going on here.,00:17:08.180,00:17:09.350
"That is, that we went a distance
alpha along this arc.",00:17:09.350,00:17:13.680
"And now remember that the
radius here is 1.",00:17:13.680,00:17:28.570
"And this horizontal distance
here is a.",00:17:28.570,00:17:34.430
This distance here is a.,00:17:34.430,00:17:37.450
"And so the geometric
interpretation of this is that",00:17:37.450,00:17:43.710
this angle is alpha radians.,00:17:43.710,00:17:51.000
And sine alpha = a.,00:17:51.000,00:17:54.950
"So this is consistent with our
definition previously, our",00:17:54.950,00:17:58.480
"previous geometric definition
of radians.",00:17:58.480,00:18:02.530
"But this is really your first
true definition of radians.",00:18:02.530,00:18:07.190
"We never actually, people told
you that radians were the arc",00:18:07.190,00:18:11.380
length along this curve.,00:18:11.380,00:18:12.570
"This is the first time
you're deriving it.",00:18:12.570,00:18:14.770
"This is the first time you're
seeing it correctly done.",00:18:14.770,00:18:18.420
"And furthermore, this is the
first time you're seeing a",00:18:18.420,00:18:20.780
"correct definition of
the sine function.",00:18:20.780,00:18:24.100
"Remember we had this crazy
way, we we defined the",00:18:24.100,00:18:26.590
"exponential function, then we
had another way of defining",00:18:26.590,00:18:29.190
"the ln function as
an integral.",00:18:29.190,00:18:30.660
"Then we defined the exponential
in terms of it.",00:18:30.660,00:18:32.900
"Well, this is the same
sort of thing.",00:18:32.900,00:18:34.690
"What's really happening here
is that if you want to know",00:18:34.690,00:18:37.040
"what radians are, you have
to calculate this number.",00:18:37.040,00:18:40.900
"If you've calculated this number
then by definition if",00:18:40.900,00:18:44.070
"sine is the thing whose alpha
radian amount gives you a,",00:18:44.070,00:18:49.280
"then it must be that this
is sine inverse of a.",00:18:49.280,00:18:52.520
"And so the first thing that gets
defined is the arc sine.",00:18:52.520,00:18:55.530
"And the next thing that gets
defined is the sine",00:18:55.530,00:18:57.940
afterwards.,00:18:57.940,00:19:00.250
"This is the way the foundational
approach actually",00:19:00.250,00:19:04.500
"works when you start from
first principles.",00:19:04.500,00:19:06.730
"This arc length being one
of the first principles.",00:19:06.730,00:19:10.200
"So now we have a solid
foundation for trig functions.",00:19:10.200,00:19:13.720
"And this is giving
that connection.",00:19:13.720,00:19:16.150
"Of course, it's consistent with
everything you already",00:19:16.150,00:19:18.020
"knew, so you don't
have to make any",00:19:18.020,00:19:19.730
transitional thinking here.,00:19:19.730,00:19:22.220
"It's just that this is the first
time it's being done",00:19:22.220,00:19:24.700
rigorously.,00:19:24.700,00:19:25.570
"Because you only now
have arc length.",00:19:25.570,00:19:36.380
"So these are examples,
as I say, that",00:19:36.380,00:19:39.520
maybe you already know.,00:19:39.520,00:19:41.220
"And maybe we'll do one that we
don't know quite as well.",00:19:41.220,00:19:44.820
"Let's find the length
of a parabola.",00:19:44.820,00:19:49.300
This is Example 3.,00:19:49.300,00:19:59.180
"Now, that was what I
was suggesting we",00:19:59.180,00:20:00.740
were going to do earlier.,00:20:00.740,00:20:03.140
"So this is the function
y = x ^2. y ' = 2x.",00:20:03.140,00:20:09.800
"And so ds = the square root
of 1 + (2x) ^2 dx.",00:20:09.800,00:20:20.120
"And now I can figure out what
a piece of a parabola is.",00:20:20.120,00:20:24.600
"So I'll draw the piece of
parabola up to a, let's say,",00:20:24.600,00:20:28.830
starting from 0.,00:20:28.830,00:20:30.840
So that's the chunk.,00:20:30.840,00:20:32.680
"And then its arc length, between
0 and a of this curve,",00:20:32.680,00:20:45.450
"is the integral from 0 to a of
square root of 1 + 4x ^2 dx.",00:20:45.450,00:21:02.400
"OK, now if you like, this is
the answer to the question.",00:21:02.400,00:21:08.490
"But people hate looking at
answers when they're integrals",00:21:08.490,00:21:12.270
if they can be evaluated.,00:21:12.270,00:21:13.800
"So one of the reasons why
we went through all this",00:21:13.800,00:21:15.830
"rigamarole of calculating these
things is to show you",00:21:15.830,00:21:18.800
"that we can actually evaluate
a bunch of these functions",00:21:18.800,00:21:22.120
here more explicitly.,00:21:22.120,00:21:23.340
"It doesn't help a lot, but
there is an explicit",00:21:23.340,00:21:27.850
calculation of this.,00:21:27.850,00:21:28.680
"So remember how you
would do this.",00:21:28.680,00:21:30.560
"So this is just a little
bit of review.",00:21:30.560,00:21:33.040
"What we did in techniques
of integration.",00:21:33.040,00:21:35.420
The first step is what?,00:21:35.420,00:21:39.000
A substitution.,00:21:39.000,00:21:40.700
It's a trig substitution.,00:21:40.700,00:21:43.950
And what is it?,00:21:43.950,00:21:45.030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:21:45.030,00:21:47.250
"PROFESSOR: So x equals
something tan theta.",00:21:47.250,00:21:50.270
"I claim that it's 1/2 tan, and
I'm going to call it u.",00:21:50.270,00:21:54.930
"Because I'm going to use theta
for something else",00:21:54.930,00:21:56.910
in a couple of days.,00:21:56.910,00:21:58.325
OK?,00:21:58.325,00:21:58.660
So this is the substitution.,00:21:58.660,00:22:01.420
"And then of course dx =
1/2 sec ^2 u du , etc.",00:22:01.420,00:22:10.620
"So what happens if
you do this?",00:22:10.620,00:22:12.750
"I'll write down the answer,
but I'm not going",00:22:12.750,00:22:15.265
to carry this out.,00:22:15.265,00:22:16.330
"Because every one of these
is horrendous.",00:22:16.330,00:22:19.090
But I think I worked it out.,00:22:19.090,00:22:22.190
Let's see if I'm lucky.,00:22:22.190,00:22:23.370
Oh yeah.,00:22:23.370,00:22:24.300
I think this is what it is.,00:22:24.300,00:22:26.380
"It's a 1/4 ln 2x + square root
of 1 + 4x ^2 + 1/2 x ( square",00:22:26.380,00:22:40.740
root of 1 + 4x ^2).,00:22:40.740,00:22:46.540
Evaluated at a and 0.,00:22:46.540,00:22:52.190
So yick.,00:22:52.190,00:22:53.090
"I mean, you know.",00:22:53.090,00:22:53.810
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:22:53.810,00:22:55.720
"PROFESSOR: Why I did
I make it 1/2?",00:22:55.720,00:22:58.850
"Because it turns out that
when you differentiate.",00:22:58.850,00:23:01.400
"So the question is, why
there 1/2 there?",00:23:01.400,00:23:02.780
"If you differentiate it without
the 1/2, you get this",00:23:02.780,00:23:05.420
"term and it looks like it's
going to be just right.",00:23:05.420,00:23:07.650
"But then if you differentiate
this one",00:23:07.650,00:23:08.990
you get another thing.,00:23:08.990,00:23:09.950
And it all mixes together.,00:23:09.950,00:23:12.170
"And it turns out that
there's more.",00:23:12.170,00:23:13.660
So it turns out that it's 1/2.,00:23:13.660,00:23:15.280
Differentiate it and check.,00:23:15.280,00:23:18.750
"So this just an incredibly
long calculation.",00:23:18.750,00:23:21.530
"It would take fifteen minutes
or something like that.",00:23:21.530,00:23:24.220
"But the point is, you
do know in principle",00:23:24.220,00:23:26.220
how to do these things.,00:23:26.220,00:23:27.840

about because when you square",00:23:53.080,00:23:56.270

formula, of x = 0 and x = a,",00:24:35.000,00:24:40.820
"it goes back to those in
the original variables.",00:24:40.820,00:24:44.740
"So if I write things in the
original variables, I have the",00:24:44.740,00:24:47.100
original limits.,00:24:47.100,00:24:48.980
"If I use the u variables, I
would have to change limits.",00:24:48.980,00:24:52.020
"But I'm not carrying out the
integration, because",00:24:52.020,00:24:53.840
I don't want to.,00:24:53.840,00:24:55.060
"So I brought it back
to the x formula.",00:24:55.060,00:25:00.630
Other questions.,00:25:00.630,00:25:07.080
"OK, so now we're ready to launch
into three-space a",00:25:07.080,00:25:11.180
little bit here.,00:25:11.180,00:25:14.250
"We're going to talk about
surface area.",00:25:14.250,00:25:41.310
"You're going to be doing a
lot with surface area in",00:25:41.310,00:25:46.660
multivariable calculus.,00:25:46.660,00:25:48.550
"It's one of the really
fun things.",00:25:48.550,00:25:50.990
"And just remember, when it gets
complicated, that the",00:25:50.990,00:25:55.870
"simplest things are the
most important.",00:25:55.870,00:25:58.180
"And the simple things are, if
you can handle things for",00:25:58.180,00:26:00.090
"linear functions, you know all
the rest. So there's going to",00:26:00.090,00:26:03.450
"be some complicated stuff but
it'll really only involve",00:26:03.450,00:26:06.390
what's happening on planes.,00:26:06.390,00:26:09.480
"So let's start with
surface area.",00:26:09.480,00:26:11.680
"And the example that I'd like to
give, this is the only type",00:26:11.680,00:26:18.630
"of example that we'll have, is
the surface of rotation.",00:26:18.630,00:26:28.560
"And as long as we have
our parabola there,",00:26:28.560,00:26:31.990
we'll use that one.,00:26:31.990,00:26:33.300
"So we have y = x ^2, rotated
around the x axis.",00:26:33.300,00:26:51.920
"So let's take a look at
what this looks like.",00:26:51.920,00:26:54.480
"It's the parabola, which
is going like that.",00:26:54.480,00:26:57.910
"And then it's being spun
around the x axis.",00:26:57.910,00:27:01.850
"So some kind of shape like
this with little circles.",00:27:01.850,00:27:08.390
"It's some kind of trumpet
shape, right?",00:27:08.390,00:27:17.880
"And that's the shape
that we're.",00:27:17.880,00:27:19.850
"Now, again, it's the surface.",00:27:19.850,00:27:20.980
"It's just the metal of the
trumpet, not the insides.",00:27:20.980,00:27:27.770
"Now, the principle for figuring
out what the formula",00:27:27.770,00:27:32.600
"for area is, is not that
different from what we did for",00:27:32.600,00:27:37.160
surfaces of revolution.,00:27:37.160,00:27:38.530
"But it just requires a little
bit of thought and",00:27:38.530,00:27:41.600
imagination.,00:27:41.600,00:27:42.610
"We have a little chunk of
arc length along here.",00:27:42.610,00:27:50.360
"And we're going to spin
that around this axis.",00:27:50.360,00:27:55.580
"Now, if this were a horizontal
piece of arc length, then it",00:27:55.580,00:28:02.230
"would spin around just
like a shell.",00:28:02.230,00:28:04.500
It would just be a surface.,00:28:04.500,00:28:07.550
"But if it's tilted, if it's
tilted, then there's more",00:28:07.550,00:28:12.660
"surface area proportional to the
amount that it's tilted.",00:28:12.660,00:28:17.040
"So it's proportional to the
length of the segment that you",00:28:17.040,00:28:19.650
spin around.,00:28:19.650,00:28:22.890
"So the total is going
to be ds, that's one",00:28:22.890,00:28:27.370
of the factors here.,00:28:27.370,00:28:29.430
Maybe I'll write that second.,00:28:29.430,00:28:32.220
That's one of the dimensions.,00:28:32.220,00:28:33.560
"And then the other dimension
is the circumference.",00:28:33.560,00:28:36.660
"Which is 2 pi, in this case y.",00:28:36.660,00:28:43.180
"So that's the end of
the calculation.",00:28:43.180,00:28:46.300
"This is the area element
of surface area.",00:28:46.300,00:28:55.990
"Now, when you get to 18.02, and
maybe even before that,",00:28:55.990,00:28:59.860
"you'll also see some people
referring to this area element",00:28:59.860,00:29:03.000
"when it's a curvy surface like
this with a notation d S.",00:29:03.000,00:29:09.190
"That's a little confusing
because we have a",00:29:09.190,00:29:10.770
lower case s here.,00:29:10.770,00:29:12.070
"We're not going to
use it right now.",00:29:12.070,00:29:15.450
"But the lower case s is
usually arc length.",00:29:15.450,00:29:17.620
"The upper case s is usually
surface area.",00:29:17.620,00:29:23.950
So.,00:29:23.950,00:29:25.650
Also used for dA.,00:29:25.650,00:29:32.510
The area element.,00:29:32.510,00:29:33.730
"Because this is a curved
area element.",00:29:33.730,00:29:39.780
"So let's figure out
this example.",00:29:39.780,00:29:47.630
"So in the example, is equal to x
^2 then the situation is, we",00:29:47.630,00:29:54.230
"have the surface area is equal
to the integral from, I don't",00:29:54.230,00:30:01.280
"know, 0 to a if those
are the limits that",00:30:01.280,00:30:03.350
we wanted to choose.,00:30:03.350,00:30:05.040
"Of 2 pi x ^2, right?",00:30:05.040,00:30:10.470
"Because y = x ^2 ( the square
root of 1 + 4x ^2) dx.",00:30:10.470,00:30:17.960
"Remember we had this from
our previous example.",00:30:17.960,00:30:20.300
This was ds from previous.,00:30:20.300,00:30:32.850
"And this, of course,
is 2 pi y.",00:30:32.850,00:30:41.930
"Now again, the calculation of
this integral is kind of long.",00:30:41.930,00:30:49.150
And I'm going to omit it.,00:30:49.150,00:30:52.060
"But let me just point out that
it follows from the same",00:30:52.060,00:30:54.950
substitution.,00:30:54.950,00:30:56.350
"Namely, x = 1/2 tan u.",00:30:56.350,00:31:01.870
"Is going to work for
this integral.",00:31:01.870,00:31:05.150
It's kind of a mess.,00:31:05.150,00:31:06.200
"There's a tan ^2 here
and the sec ^2.",00:31:06.200,00:31:08.590
"There's another secant
and so on.",00:31:08.590,00:31:10.170
"So it's one of these trig
integrals that then takes a",00:31:10.170,00:31:13.955
while to do.,00:31:13.955,00:31:19.670
"So that just is going to
trail off into nothing.",00:31:19.670,00:31:22.940
"And the reason is that
what's important",00:31:22.940,00:31:25.200
here is more the method.,00:31:25.200,00:31:27.250
"And the setup of
the integrals.",00:31:27.250,00:31:29.650
"The actual computation, in
fact, you could go to a",00:31:29.650,00:31:32.450
"program and you could plug in
something like this and you",00:31:32.450,00:31:34.790
"would spit out an answer
immediately.",00:31:34.790,00:31:37.300
"So really what we just want is
for you to have enough control",00:31:37.300,00:31:41.100
"to see that it's an integral
that's a manageable one.",00:31:41.100,00:31:43.640
"And also to know that if
you plugged it in, you",00:31:43.640,00:31:45.760
would get an answer.,00:31:45.760,00:31:50.970
"When I actually do carry out a
calculation, though, what I",00:31:50.970,00:31:53.630
"want to do is to do something
that has an answer that you",00:31:53.630,00:31:59.090
can remember.,00:31:59.090,00:32:00.190
And that's a nice answer.,00:32:00.190,00:32:02.090
"So that turns out to be
the example of the",00:32:02.090,00:32:05.530
surface area of a sphere.,00:32:05.530,00:32:07.580
"So it's analogous
to this 2 here.",00:32:07.580,00:32:10.110
"And maybe I should remember
this result here.",00:32:10.110,00:32:15.170
"Which was that the arc length
element was given by this.",00:32:15.170,00:32:24.390
"So we'll save that
for a second.",00:32:24.390,00:32:38.700
"So we're going to do this
surface area now.",00:32:38.700,00:32:41.710
"So if you like, this
is another example.",00:32:41.710,00:32:43.930
The surface area of a sphere.,00:32:43.930,00:32:54.820
"This is a good example, and
one, as I say, that has a",00:32:54.820,00:33:00.170
really nice answer.,00:33:00.170,00:33:01.160
So it's worth doing.,00:33:01.160,00:33:07.130
"So first of all, I'm not going
to set it up quite the way I",00:33:07.130,00:33:09.850
did in Example 2.,00:33:09.850,00:33:11.840
"Instead, I'm going to take the
general sphere, because I'd",00:33:11.840,00:33:14.080
"like to watch the dependence
on the radius.",00:33:14.080,00:33:18.790
"So here this is going
to be the radius.",00:33:18.790,00:33:22.160
It's going to be radius a.,00:33:22.160,00:33:27.250
"And now, if I carry out the same
calculations as before,",00:33:27.250,00:33:31.890
"if you think about it for a
second, you're going to get",00:33:31.890,00:33:35.290
this result.,00:33:35.290,00:33:39.680
"And then, the rest of the
arithmetic, which is sitting",00:33:39.680,00:33:43.780
"up there in the case, a = 1,
will give us that ds = what?",00:33:43.780,00:33:53.120
"Well, maybe I'll just
carry it out.",00:33:53.120,00:33:56.670
Because that's always nice.,00:33:56.670,00:33:58.510
"So we have 1 + x ^2
/ a ^2 - x ^2.",00:33:58.510,00:34:03.630
That's 1 + (y ') ^2.,00:34:03.630,00:34:07.060
"And now I put this over
a common denominator.",00:34:07.060,00:34:09.630
And I get a ^2 - x ^2.,00:34:09.630,00:34:11.800
"And I have in the numerator
a ^2 - x ^2 + x^2.",00:34:11.800,00:34:15.030
"So the same cancellation
occurs.",00:34:15.030,00:34:17.590
"But now we get an a ^2
in the numerator.",00:34:17.590,00:34:25.390
So now I can set up the ds.,00:34:25.390,00:34:28.070
And so here's what happens.,00:34:28.070,00:34:30.200
"The area of a section of the
sphere, so let's see.",00:34:30.200,00:34:35.370
"We're going to start at some
starting place x1, and end at",00:34:35.370,00:34:39.270
some place x2.,00:34:39.270,00:34:40.760
So what does that look like?,00:34:40.760,00:34:43.110
Here's the sphere.,00:34:43.110,00:34:45.140
"And we're starting
at a place x1.",00:34:45.140,00:34:47.490
"And we're ending
at a place x2.",00:34:47.490,00:34:49.810
"And we're taking more or less
the slice here, if you like.",00:34:49.810,00:34:53.830
The section of this sphere.,00:34:53.830,00:34:59.480
"So the area's going
to equal this.",00:34:59.480,00:35:02.150
And what is it going to be?,00:35:02.150,00:35:06.730
"Well, so I have here 2 pi y.",00:35:06.730,00:35:12.820
"I'll write it out, just
leave it as y for now.",00:35:12.820,00:35:15.310
And then I have ds.,00:35:15.310,00:35:19.190
"So that's always what the
formula is when you're",00:35:19.190,00:35:22.110
revolving around the x axis.,00:35:22.110,00:35:25.880
"And then I'll plug in
for those things.",00:35:25.880,00:35:29.920
"So 2 pi, the formula for y is
square root a ^2 - x ^2.",00:35:29.920,00:35:38.700
"And the formula for ds, well,
it's the square root",00:35:38.700,00:35:42.860
of this times dx.,00:35:42.860,00:35:44.970
"So it's the square root of
a ^2 / a ^2 - x ^2 dx.",00:35:44.970,00:35:51.760
So this part is ds.,00:35:51.760,00:35:54.880
And this part is y.,00:35:54.880,00:36:02.170
"And now, I claim we have a nice",00:36:02.170,00:36:05.230
cancellation that takes place.,00:36:05.230,00:36:07.590
Square root of a ^2 = a.,00:36:07.590,00:36:09.770
"And then there's another
good cancellation.",00:36:09.770,00:36:12.740
As you can see.,00:36:12.740,00:36:13.990
"Now, what we get here is the
integral from x1 to x2, of 2",00:36:13.990,00:36:17.805
"pi a dx, which is about
the easiest",00:36:17.805,00:36:21.160
integral you can imagine.,00:36:21.160,00:36:23.340
"It's just the integral
of a constant.",00:36:23.340,00:36:24.940
So it's 2 pi a ( x2 - x1).,00:36:24.940,00:36:36.810
"Let's check this in a
couple of examples.",00:36:36.810,00:36:40.780
"And then see what it's saying
geometrically, a little bit.",00:36:40.780,00:36:48.390
"So what this is saying, so
special cases that you should",00:36:48.390,00:36:54.190
"always check when you have a
nice formula like this, at",00:36:54.190,00:36:58.220
"least. But really with anything
in order to make sure",00:36:58.220,00:37:01.250
"that you've got the
right answer.",00:37:01.250,00:37:03.250
"If you take, for example,
the hemisphere.",00:37:03.250,00:37:05.710
"So you take 1/2 of
this sphere.",00:37:05.710,00:37:08.920
"So that would be starting
at 0, sorry.",00:37:08.920,00:37:11.090
And ending at a.,00:37:11.090,00:37:14.300
"So that's the integral
from 0 to a.",00:37:14.300,00:37:17.270
"So this is the case
x1 = 0. x2 = a.",00:37:17.270,00:37:21.890
"And what you're going to
get is a hemisphere.",00:37:21.890,00:37:29.190
And the area is (2 pi a ) a.,00:37:29.190,00:37:36.270
"Or in other words, 2 pi a ^2.",00:37:36.270,00:37:42.410
"And if you take the whole
sphere, that's starting at x1",00:37:42.410,00:37:50.520
"= - a, and x2 = a, you're
getting (2 pi a) ( a - (- a)).",00:37:50.520,00:38:02.640
Which is 4 pi a ^2.,00:38:02.640,00:38:06.380
That's the whole thing.,00:38:06.380,00:38:09.230
"Yeah, question.",00:38:09.230,00:38:10.140
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:38:10.140,00:38:21.780
"PROFESSOR: The question is,
would it be possible to rotate",00:38:21.780,00:38:24.590
around the y axis?,00:38:24.590,00:38:27.730
And the answer is yes.,00:38:27.730,00:38:30.330
"It's legal to rotate
around the y axis.",00:38:30.330,00:38:34.550
"And there is, if you use
vertical slices as we did",00:38:34.550,00:38:41.400
"here, that is, well they're sort
of tips of slices, it's a",00:38:41.400,00:38:45.710
different idea.,00:38:45.710,00:38:46.790
"But anyway, it's using dx as the
integral of the variable",00:38:46.790,00:38:50.910
of integration.,00:38:50.910,00:38:52.670
"So we're checking each little
piece, each little",00:38:52.670,00:38:55.800
strip of that type.,00:38:55.800,00:38:58.750
"If we use dx here,
we get this.",00:38:58.750,00:39:00.540
"If you did the same thing
rotated the other way, and use",00:39:00.540,00:39:03.130
"dy as the variable, you get
exactly the same answer.",00:39:03.130,00:39:06.140
"And it would be the
same calculation.",00:39:06.140,00:39:08.120
Because they're parallel.,00:39:08.120,00:39:14.080
"So you're, yep.",00:39:14.080,00:39:14.870
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:14.870,00:39:17.280
"PROFESSOR: Can you do service
area with shells?",00:39:17.280,00:39:19.770
"Well, ah shell shape.",00:39:19.770,00:39:23.330
The short answer is not quite.,00:39:23.330,00:39:26.540
"The shell shape is a vertical
shell which is itself already",00:39:26.540,00:39:32.340
"three-dimensional, and
it has a thickness.",00:39:32.340,00:39:34.850
"So this is just a matter
of terminology, though.",00:39:34.850,00:39:37.270
"This thickness is this dx, when
we do this rotation here.",00:39:37.270,00:39:41.210
"And then there are two
other dimensions.",00:39:41.210,00:39:43.820
"If we have a curved surface,
there's no other dimension",00:39:43.820,00:39:47.080
left to form a shell.,00:39:47.080,00:39:56.460
"But basically, you can chop
things up into any bits that",00:39:56.460,00:39:59.760
you can actually measure.,00:39:59.760,00:40:00.670
"That you can figure out
what the area is.",00:40:00.670,00:40:04.020
That's the main point.,00:40:04.020,00:40:08.270
"Now, I said we were going to,
we've just launched into",00:40:08.270,00:40:10.960
three-dimensional space.,00:40:10.960,00:40:12.910
"And I want to now move on to
other space-like phenomena.",00:40:12.910,00:40:21.650
But we're going to do this.,00:40:21.650,00:40:26.780
"So this is also a preparation
for 18.02, where you'll be",00:40:26.780,00:40:31.980
"doing this a tremendous
amount.",00:40:31.980,00:40:34.840
"We're going to talk now about
parametric equations.",00:40:34.840,00:40:49.530
Really just parametric curves.,00:40:49.530,00:40:57.150
"So you're going to see this
now and we're going to",00:40:57.150,00:40:59.320
"interpret it a couple of times,
and we're going to",00:40:59.320,00:41:00.890
think about polar coordinates.,00:41:00.890,00:41:02.580
"These are all preparation for
thinking in more variables,",00:41:02.580,00:41:05.920
"and thinking in a different
way than you've",00:41:05.920,00:41:08.570
been thinking before.,00:41:08.570,00:41:09.720
"So I want you to prepare
your brain to make",00:41:09.720,00:41:12.520
a transition here.,00:41:12.520,00:41:14.130
"This is the beginning
of the transition to",00:41:14.130,00:41:16.540
multivariable thinking.,00:41:16.540,00:41:21.580
"We're going to consider
curves like this.",00:41:21.580,00:41:26.350
"Which are described with x being
a function of t and y",00:41:26.350,00:41:29.850
being a function of t.,00:41:29.850,00:41:31.410
"And this letter t is called
the parameter.",00:41:31.410,00:41:35.630
"In this case you should think
of it, the easiest way to",00:41:35.630,00:41:38.150
think of it is as time.,00:41:38.150,00:41:39.700
"And what you have is what's
called a trajectory.",00:41:39.700,00:41:43.840
"So this is also called
a trajectory.",00:41:43.840,00:41:48.090
"And its location, let's
say, at time 0, is",00:41:48.090,00:41:52.410
this location here.,00:41:52.410,00:41:54.590
"Of (0, y ( 0)), that's
a point in the plane.",00:41:54.590,00:41:58.310
"And then over here, for
instance, maybe",00:41:58.310,00:42:00.640
"it's (x ( 1), y (1)).",00:42:00.640,00:42:04.410
"And I drew arrows along here to
indicate that we're going",00:42:04.410,00:42:07.630
"from this place over
to that place.",00:42:07.630,00:42:10.110
"These are later times. t = 1
is a later time than t = 0.",00:42:10.110,00:42:16.190
"So that's just a very casual,
it's just the way",00:42:16.190,00:42:20.560
we use these notations.,00:42:20.560,00:42:22.680
"Now let me give you the first
example, which is x = a cos t,",00:42:22.680,00:42:33.040
y = a sin t.,00:42:33.040,00:42:40.340
"And the first thing to figure
out is what kind",00:42:40.340,00:42:43.140
of curve this is.,00:42:43.140,00:42:45.490
"And to do that, we want to
figure out what equation it",00:42:45.490,00:42:48.770
"satisfies in rectangular
coordinates.",00:42:48.770,00:42:52.000
"So to figure out what curve this
is, we recognize that if",00:42:52.000,00:42:54.880
we square and add.,00:42:54.880,00:42:57.720
"So we add x ^2 to y^2, we're
going to get something very",00:42:57.720,00:43:01.300
nice and clean.,00:43:01.300,00:43:02.670
"We're going to get a^2 cos
^2 t + a ^2 sin ^2 t.",00:43:02.670,00:43:11.990
"Yeah that's right, OK.",00:43:11.990,00:43:13.500
"Which is just a ^2 (cos^2
+ sin ^2), or",00:43:13.500,00:43:16.842
in other words a^2.,00:43:16.842,00:43:19.230
"So lo and behold, what
we have is a circle.",00:43:19.230,00:43:23.450
"And then we know what
shape this is now.",00:43:23.450,00:43:27.840
"And the other thing I'd like
to keep track of is which",00:43:27.840,00:43:33.850
"direction we're going
on the circle.",00:43:33.850,00:43:35.990
"Because there's more to this
parameter then just the shape.",00:43:35.990,00:43:40.020
"There's also where we
are at what time.",00:43:40.020,00:43:42.570
"This would be, think
of it like the",00:43:42.570,00:43:44.000
trajectory of a planet.,00:43:44.000,00:43:46.610
"So here, I have to do this by
plotting the picture and",00:43:46.610,00:43:52.060
figuring out what happens.,00:43:52.060,00:43:53.250
"So at t = 0, we have (x, y) is
equal to, plug in here (a cos",00:43:53.250,00:44:02.770
"0, a sin 0).",00:44:02.770,00:44:06.190
"Which is just a * 1
+ a * 0, so a0.",00:44:06.190,00:44:10.570
And that's here.,00:44:10.570,00:44:11.830
"That's the point (a, 0).",00:44:11.830,00:44:14.660
"We know that it's the
circle of radius a.",00:44:14.660,00:44:18.810
"So we know that the curve
is going to go",00:44:18.810,00:44:20.360
around like this somehow.,00:44:20.360,00:44:22.140
"So let's see what happens
at t = pi / 2.",00:44:22.140,00:44:26.390
"So at that point, we have
(x,y) = ( a cos pi /",00:44:26.390,00:44:32.500
"2, a sin pi / 2).",00:44:32.500,00:44:37.310
"Which is (0, a), because
sine of pi / 2 = 1.",00:44:37.310,00:44:41.580
So that's up here.,00:44:41.580,00:44:43.190
"So this is what happens
at t = 0.",00:44:43.190,00:44:46.100
"This is what happens
at t = pi / 2.",00:44:46.100,00:44:49.220
"And the trajectory clearly
goes this way.",00:44:49.220,00:44:51.390
"In fact, this turns out
to be t = pi, etc.",00:44:51.390,00:44:54.800
And it repeats at t = 2 pi.,00:44:54.800,00:44:58.330
"So the other feature that we
have, which is qualitative",00:44:58.330,00:45:01.600
"feature, is that it's
counterclockwise.",00:45:01.600,00:45:11.560
"No the last little bit is going
to be the arc length.",00:45:11.560,00:45:17.020
"Keeping track of
the arc length.",00:45:17.020,00:45:19.030
And we'll do that next time.,00:45:19.030,00:45:23.390
