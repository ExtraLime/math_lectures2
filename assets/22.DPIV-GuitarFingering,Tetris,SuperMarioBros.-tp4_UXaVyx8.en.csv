"PROFESSOR: Today's
our last lecture",00:00:27.322,00:00:28.780
"on dynamic programming,
the grand finale.",00:00:28.780,00:00:31.270
"And we have a bunch of fun
examples today on piano,",00:00:31.270,00:00:35.550
"guitar, Tetris and
Super Mario Brothers.",00:00:35.550,00:00:39.440
What could be better?,00:00:39.440,00:00:42.090
"We are, again, going to
follow this five-step plan",00:00:42.090,00:00:44.830
"to dynamic programming, define
sub-problems, guess something",00:00:44.830,00:00:48.260
"in order to solve a sub-problem,
write a recurrence that",00:00:48.260,00:00:51.110
"uses that guessing to relate
different sub-problems,",00:00:51.110,00:00:53.920
"then build your dynamic
programming either",00:00:53.920,00:00:56.220
"by just implementing as
a recursive algorithm",00:00:56.220,00:00:58.130
"and memorizing or
building it bottom up.",00:00:58.130,00:01:01.940
"For the first, you need to check
with the recurrence is acyclic.",00:01:01.940,00:01:05.360
"For the second, you need an
actual topological order.",00:01:05.360,00:01:08.020
"These are, of course,
equivalent constraints.",00:01:08.020,00:01:10.880
"Personally, I like to write
down on topological order",00:01:10.880,00:01:13.220
"because that proves to
me that it is acyclic,",00:01:13.220,00:01:15.310
if I think about it.,00:01:15.310,00:01:17.400
But either way is fine.,00:01:17.400,00:01:19.955
"Then we get that the
total running time",00:01:19.955,00:01:21.580
"is number of sub-problems
times time per sub-problems,",00:01:21.580,00:01:24.292
"and then we need to solve
our original problem.",00:01:24.292,00:01:26.250
"Usually it's just one
of the sub-problems,",00:01:26.250,00:01:27.999
"but sometimes we have to
look at a few of them.",00:01:27.999,00:01:31.056
"So that's what
we're going to do.",00:01:31.056,00:01:32.430
"And we have one
new concept today",00:01:32.430,00:01:34.320
"that all these examples
will illustrate,",00:01:34.320,00:01:38.200
"which is a kind of
second kind of guessing.",00:01:38.200,00:01:41.570
"We've talked about
guessing in part two",00:01:41.570,00:01:44.270
"here in which we saw
the obvious thing.",00:01:44.270,00:01:46.620
"In the recurrence, we
usually take the min",00:01:46.620,00:01:48.400
"of a bunch of options or the
max of a bunch of options.",00:01:48.400,00:01:51.830
"And those options correspond
to a guessed feature.",00:01:51.830,00:01:54.744
"We don't know whether
the go left or go right,",00:01:54.744,00:01:56.660
so we try them both.,00:01:56.660,00:01:57.493
That's guessing.,00:01:57.493,00:01:59.000
"But there's another
way to guess.",00:01:59.000,00:02:02.110
So two kinds of guessing.,00:02:02.110,00:02:11.640
So you can do it in step two.,00:02:17.590,00:02:21.377
"Let's see what I have
to say about these.",00:02:21.377,00:02:23.085
"In step two and three,
you are guessing usually",00:02:26.320,00:02:36.270
"which sub-problems
to use in order",00:02:36.270,00:02:38.250
"to solve your
bigger sub-problem.",00:02:38.250,00:02:44.140
"So that's what we've seen
many, many times by now.",00:02:50.470,00:02:52.720
"Every DP that we've covered
except for Fibonacci numbers",00:02:52.720,00:02:55.940
has used this kind of guessing.,00:02:55.940,00:02:58.020
"And it's sort of the most
common, I guess you might say.",00:02:58.020,00:03:00.980
"But there's a higher
level of guessing",00:03:00.980,00:03:03.160
"that you can use, which
we've sort of seen",00:03:03.160,00:03:05.750
"in the knapsack dynamic
programming, dynamic program,",00:03:05.750,00:03:09.200
"which is when you define your
sub-problems, you can add more.",00:03:09.200,00:03:13.680
"Add more sub-problems to
guess or you can think of it",00:03:21.140,00:03:26.350
"as remembering more
features of the solution.",00:03:26.350,00:03:31.315
And we just leave it at that.,00:03:38.820,00:03:40.300
"Essentially what this does--
so remember with knapsack,",00:03:43.240,00:03:49.400
we had a sequence of items.,00:03:49.400,00:03:50.950
They had values and sizes.,00:03:50.950,00:03:54.460
"And we had some target
knapsack, some capacity.",00:03:54.460,00:03:57.115
"We wanted to pack those
items into that knapsack.",00:03:57.115,00:03:59.340
"And the obvious sub-problems
were suffixes of the items.",00:03:59.340,00:04:02.370
"Because we always know
suffixes, prefixes, substrings,",00:04:02.370,00:04:04.620
"those are the obvious
things to try.",00:04:04.620,00:04:06.370
"But suffixes wasn't
quite enough.",00:04:06.370,00:04:07.970
"Because if we
looked at a suffix,",00:04:07.970,00:04:09.630
"we didn't know of
the prefix that we've",00:04:09.630,00:04:12.290
"skipped over how
many of those items",00:04:12.290,00:04:14.251
"were in-- and in particular,
how much of the capacity",00:04:14.251,00:04:16.459
we'd used up.,00:04:16.459,00:04:17.722
"And so we needed to
add more sub-problems",00:04:17.722,00:04:19.430
"to remember how much capacity
had we used up in the prefix.",00:04:19.430,00:04:23.440
"We did that by multiplying
every sub-problem",00:04:23.440,00:04:25.610
"by s different choices, which is
how many units of the knapsack",00:04:25.610,00:04:32.190
still remain.,00:04:32.190,00:04:34.234
"So in some sense,
we're remembering more",00:04:34.234,00:04:35.900
about the prefix.,00:04:35.900,00:04:37.460
"You can also think of it as--
in the more forward direction,",00:04:37.460,00:04:41.110
we have the suffix problem.,00:04:41.110,00:04:42.480
"I'm going to solve
it s different times,",00:04:42.480,00:04:44.420
or s plus 1 different times.,00:04:44.420,00:04:45.664
I'm going to solve it.,00:04:45.664,00:04:46.580
What if I had a big knapsack?,00:04:46.580,00:04:47.816
"What if I had a
smaller knapsack?",00:04:47.816,00:04:49.190
"What if I had a
zero-size knapsack?",00:04:49.190,00:04:50.780
"All of those different
versions of the problem.",00:04:50.780,00:04:53.130
"In some sense, you were
solving more sub-problems.",00:04:53.130,00:04:57.270
"You're, in some, sense
finding more solutions",00:04:57.270,00:04:59.330
to that sub-problem.,00:04:59.330,00:05:00.286
You're looking at a suffix.,00:05:00.286,00:05:01.410
"And I want to know all these
different solutions that",00:05:01.410,00:05:04.750
"use different amounts
of the knapsack.",00:05:04.750,00:05:07.619
"So in that sense, you're just
adding more sub-problems.",00:05:07.619,00:05:09.910
"But from a guessing
perspective, you're",00:05:09.910,00:05:11.534
remembering more about the past.,00:05:11.534,00:05:12.980
"We're going to see a bunch of
examples of this type today.",00:05:12.980,00:05:16.220
"We'll always use
this type, but we'll",00:05:16.220,00:05:18.780
"see more of this where the
obvious sub-problems don't work",00:05:18.780,00:05:23.230
and we need to add more.,00:05:23.230,00:05:25.940
"So the first example is
piano and guitar fingering.",00:05:25.940,00:05:33.080
"This is a practical problem for
any musicians in the audience.",00:05:38.030,00:05:42.940
"How many people here play
piano, or have played piano?",00:05:42.940,00:05:45.770
"OK, about a quarter.",00:05:45.770,00:05:46.740
"How many people
have played guitar?",00:05:46.740,00:05:49.740
"A few, all right.",00:05:49.740,00:05:51.560
I brought my guitar.,00:05:51.560,00:05:52.480
"I've been learning
this semester.",00:05:52.480,00:05:53.855
"I'm not very good yet,
but we'll fool around",00:05:53.855,00:05:56.320
with it a little bit.,00:05:56.320,00:05:58.010
"So the general idea is you're
given some musical piece",00:05:58.010,00:06:03.553
that you want to play.,00:06:03.553,00:06:05.810
"And on a piano, there's
a bunch of keys.",00:06:05.810,00:06:07.870
"You have all these
keyboards, so you",00:06:07.870,00:06:09.480
"know what a piano looks
like, more or less.",00:06:09.480,00:06:11.045
"It's just like a
keyboard, but only row.",00:06:11.045,00:06:12.711
It's crazy.,00:06:12.711,00:06:13.470
"Each key that you
press makes a note,",00:06:16.910,00:06:18.930
"and every key has
a different note.",00:06:18.930,00:06:20.800
"So it's very simple from
a computer scientist's",00:06:20.800,00:06:23.900
perspective.,00:06:23.900,00:06:24.480
"You want to play a
note, you push the key.",00:06:24.480,00:06:26.229
"But you could push it with
any one of these fingers.",00:06:26.229,00:06:29.630
Humans have 10 fingers.,00:06:29.630,00:06:30.840
Most humans.,00:06:30.840,00:06:31.940
I guess a few have more.,00:06:31.940,00:06:33.560
"But you want to know,
which finger should I",00:06:33.560,00:06:37.800
use to play each note?,00:06:37.800,00:06:39.340
It may not seem like a big deal.,00:06:39.340,00:06:40.680
"And if you're only playing
one note, it's not a big deal.",00:06:40.680,00:06:43.140
"But if you're going to play
a long sequence of notes,",00:06:43.140,00:06:46.250
"some transitions are
easier than others.",00:06:46.250,00:06:48.760
"So let's say we're given
a sequence of n notes",00:06:48.760,00:06:55.620
we want to play.,00:06:55.620,00:06:58.470
"And we want to find a
fingering for each note.",00:06:58.470,00:07:07.060
"So fingering, so let's
say there are-- I'm",00:07:12.100,00:07:15.780
"going to label the fingers
on your hand, 1 up to f.",00:07:15.780,00:07:21.540
"For humans, f is
5 or 10, depending",00:07:21.540,00:07:24.820
"on if you're doing one
hand or two hand stuff.",00:07:24.820,00:07:27.480
"I think to keep it simple, let's
think about piano, right hand",00:07:27.480,00:07:33.040
"only, and just you're playing
one note at the time, OK?",00:07:33.040,00:07:36.320
"We're going to make it
more complicated later.",00:07:36.320,00:07:38.320
"But let's just think of a
note as being a single note.",00:07:38.320,00:07:41.470
"OK, or you can think of
guitar, single note, left hand",00:07:44.816,00:07:48.710
is playing things.,00:07:48.710,00:07:50.590
"You want to assign one of
these fingers to each node.",00:07:50.590,00:07:54.160
"And then you have a
difficulty measure, d.",00:07:54.160,00:08:04.870
"And this you need to
think about for awhile",00:08:04.870,00:08:06.850
"musically, or anatomically,
how to define.",00:08:06.850,00:08:12.620
"If we have some note p
and we're on finger f",00:08:12.620,00:08:16.380
"and we want to transition
to note q using figure g,",00:08:16.380,00:08:20.980
how hard is that?,00:08:20.980,00:08:23.410
"So this is-- the p and
q are notes to play.",00:08:23.410,00:08:28.280
I guess p stands for pitch.,00:08:28.280,00:08:30.730
And f and g are fingers.,00:08:30.730,00:08:34.400
"So this is how hard is it
to transition from f on p",00:08:34.400,00:08:39.340
to g on q.,00:08:39.340,00:08:40.470
"There's a huge
literature on for piano.",00:08:43.580,00:08:47.960
"There are a lot of
rules like, well,",00:08:47.960,00:08:51.350
"if p is much smaller than
q, unless they're stretched,",00:08:51.350,00:08:55.420
then that becomes hard.,00:08:55.420,00:08:58.370
"And if you want to
stretch, you probably",00:08:58.370,00:09:00.520
"need to use fingers that are
far away from each other.",00:09:00.520,00:09:04.230
"If your playing legato-- so you
have to smoothly go from one",00:09:04.230,00:09:07.460
"note the other-- you can't use
the same finger on both keys.",00:09:07.460,00:09:10.150
"So if f equals g and
you're playing legato,",00:09:10.150,00:09:13.950
"then p better be the
same as q sort of thing.",00:09:13.950,00:09:17.680
There's a weak finger rule.,00:09:20.166,00:09:21.290
"You tend to avoid fingers
four and five, these two.",00:09:21.290,00:09:25.730
"Apparently going from-- I'm
not much of a pianist-- so",00:09:25.730,00:09:29.120
"going from between
three and four,",00:09:29.120,00:09:31.547
"which I can barely hold them
up, it's kind of difficult,",00:09:31.547,00:09:33.880
"is ""annoying.""",00:09:33.880,00:09:34.975
That's what I wrote down.,00:09:34.975,00:09:36.880
"So between three and four
transitions you try and avoid.",00:09:36.880,00:09:40.170
"And so you can encode
into this function.",00:09:40.170,00:09:42.210
It's a giant table.,00:09:42.210,00:09:43.190
"You can just put
in whatever values",00:09:43.190,00:09:44.720
"you want that you're
most comfortable with.",00:09:44.720,00:09:46.690
"And music theorists
work a lot on trying",00:09:46.690,00:09:48.940
to define these function so.,00:09:48.940,00:09:51.735
So you can do that.,00:09:51.735,00:09:53.880
"And for guitar, maybe I
should do a little example.",00:09:53.880,00:09:58.736
Get this out.,00:09:58.736,00:10:01.770
"I can't play much,
so bear with me.",00:10:01.770,00:10:04.605
"Bet you didn't think
this would happen in 006.",00:10:07.984,00:10:09.900
[LAUGHTER],00:10:09.900,00:10:12.220
So let's see.,00:10:12.220,00:10:15.100
"So let's say you're trying
to play your favorite song.",00:10:15.100,00:10:17.670
"[STRUMS ""SUPER MARIO BROTHERS""
 THEME]",00:10:17.670,00:10:20.484
[LAUGHTER],00:10:20.484,00:10:22.360
OK.,00:10:22.360,00:10:23.300
"So when I'm playing that, I have
to think about the fingering.",00:10:23.300,00:10:26.530
"Which finger is going to
go where to play each note?",00:10:26.530,00:10:29.060
"OK, so the first notes
are actually open,",00:10:29.060,00:10:31.920
so it's really easy.,00:10:31.920,00:10:33.230
"And then I go up to holding the
first fret on the fifth string.",00:10:33.230,00:10:40.730
"OK, and I'm using my index
finger because everyone",00:10:40.730,00:10:43.840
loves to use their index finger.,00:10:43.840,00:10:45.230
"And in particular because
the very next note",00:10:45.230,00:10:48.010
"I'm going to play-- well,
actually it's down here.",00:10:48.010,00:10:50.720
"Then the next note is
going to be this one.",00:10:50.720,00:10:53.640
"So I'm holding on the third
fret of the bottom string.",00:10:53.640,00:10:57.860
"And then I've got to
transition over here.",00:10:57.860,00:10:59.770
"And actually, usually I do
it with my middle finger.",00:10:59.770,00:11:02.370
"I don't know quite why I
find that easier, but I do.",00:11:02.370,00:11:05.553
"OK, and so I've actually
played that opening a zillion",00:11:05.553,00:11:09.731
"times with lots of
different things.",00:11:09.731,00:11:11.230
"This is the one I found to
be the most comfortable.",00:11:11.230,00:11:13.355
"And there's this issue, right?",00:11:13.355,00:11:14.604
"If your pinky is here, where
can I reach with this finger?",00:11:14.604,00:11:17.150
"Where can I reach
with this finger?",00:11:17.150,00:11:19.690
It gets difficult.,00:11:19.690,00:11:20.444
"And in particular,
it's very hard for me",00:11:20.444,00:11:22.110
"to reach down here
when my pink is there.",00:11:22.110,00:11:25.440
"And so you can encode
that in this d function",00:11:25.440,00:11:28.440
however you want.,00:11:28.440,00:11:30.410
You get the idea.,00:11:30.410,00:11:33.038
[APPLAUSE],00:11:33.038,00:11:35.930
Thanks.,00:11:35.930,00:11:37.499
"I'll skip to our lessons.
[? We're ?] [? worth ?]",00:11:37.499,00:11:39.540
"[? it. ?] So let's solve this
with dynamic programming, OK?",00:11:39.540,00:11:46.350
That's the cool thing.,00:11:46.350,00:11:47.420
So we can do it.,00:11:47.420,00:11:49.710
"And we follow our
five step procedure.",00:11:49.710,00:11:54.450
"So the first thing is
to define sub-problems.",00:11:54.450,00:11:56.340
"What are the sub-problems
for a set-up like this?",00:11:56.340,00:11:59.530
"What are the three
obvious candidates?",00:12:04.710,00:12:06.370
Do you remember last lecture?,00:12:20.990,00:12:22.400
How many people know the answer?,00:12:27.367,00:12:28.700
Just checking.,00:12:28.700,00:12:29.283
One person.,00:12:32.544,00:12:34.432
Go for it.,00:12:34.432,00:12:35.376
"AUDIENCE: Prefixes,
suffixes, and substrings.",00:12:35.376,00:12:37.262
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:12:37.262,00:12:37.970
"Prefixes, suffixes,
and substrings.",00:12:37.970,00:12:39.428
We have a sequence of notes.,00:12:39.428,00:12:40.595
"We're not going to worry
about the sequence of fingers.",00:12:40.595,00:12:42.886
"I don't think that's
too big a deal.",00:12:42.886,00:12:44.530
That's what we're finding.,00:12:44.530,00:12:45.800
"What we're given is
a sequence of notes,",00:12:45.800,00:12:48.030
"so we should try suffixes,
prefixes, or substrings.",00:12:48.030,00:12:50.530
"I'll just tell you,
suffixes are fine.",00:12:50.530,00:12:54.318
Kind of.,00:12:54.318,00:12:55.690
"So a sub-problem
will be suffixes,",00:12:55.690,00:13:01.500
"so how to play notes
from i onwards.",00:13:01.500,00:13:10.440
"Intuitively, we
want to figure out,",00:13:10.440,00:13:12.120
"how should we play
the first note?",00:13:12.120,00:13:13.782
"And then we go on to the
second note and so on.",00:13:13.782,00:13:15.740
"So we're applying
them one by one",00:13:15.740,00:13:17.770
"from left to right
from the prefix side.",00:13:17.770,00:13:19.930
"And so we'll always
be left with a suffix.",00:13:19.930,00:13:22.040
"OK, then we need
to guess something.",00:13:24.940,00:13:28.340
"What's the obvious
thing to guess,",00:13:28.340,00:13:30.510
"given I need to
play notes i onward?",00:13:30.510,00:13:32.390
Think little harder.,00:13:36.315,00:13:38.939
"This one you shouldn't
have to think.",00:13:38.939,00:13:40.480
That's what I tell you.,00:13:40.480,00:13:43.080
"Try suffixes, try
prefixes, try substrings.",00:13:43.080,00:13:45.195
Yeah?,00:13:55.121,00:13:55.621
"AUDIENCE: Maybe which
finger to just put around i?",00:13:55.621,00:13:58.050
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, which we're
going to use for note i.",00:13:58.050,00:14:00.330
"Our whole point is
to assign fingering.",00:14:00.330,00:14:02.555
The first note here is i.,00:14:02.555,00:14:03.850
"So let's think about i,
what could you do for i?",00:14:03.850,00:14:06.090
We'll try all the possibilities.,00:14:06.090,00:14:07.960
Which finger to use for note i?,00:14:07.960,00:14:14.660
"OK, now the really hard part--
because it's impossible--",00:14:19.460,00:14:22.680
is to write a recurrence.,00:14:22.680,00:14:23.960
"This is wrong, by the way, but
it's the first thing to try.",00:14:23.960,00:14:28.936
"So this is what
I want to ask you",00:14:28.936,00:14:30.310
to do because it's not possible.,00:14:30.310,00:14:31.980
"But intuitively, what
we might try to do",00:14:31.980,00:14:34.060
"is we're trying
to solve DP for i.",00:14:34.060,00:14:37.930
"And we want to find--
this is difficulty,",00:14:37.930,00:14:40.110
"so you want to
minimize difficulty.",00:14:40.110,00:14:42.450
"So we'll take a min
over all of our guesses",00:14:42.450,00:14:45.550
"of what it would take to
solve the rest of the notes,",00:14:45.550,00:14:50.730
"to play the rest of the
notes, plus somehow the cost",00:14:50.730,00:14:53.720
of playing the first note.,00:14:53.720,00:14:56.640
"So what's the cost of
playing the first note?",00:14:56.640,00:14:59.750
"And then is going to be
a for loop over fingers.",00:14:59.750,00:15:01.770
"OK, that's going to be the min.",00:15:05.649,00:15:06.940
"We want to try all possible
fingers for note i.",00:15:06.940,00:15:11.700
"Then we have to play
all the remaining notes.",00:15:11.700,00:15:13.700
"And then there's
this transition cost",00:15:13.700,00:15:15.241
"where you're going from
note i to i plus 1.",00:15:15.241,00:15:17.300
"So it's going to
be something like d",00:15:17.300,00:15:19.470
"of if-- we know that we use
finger f to play i-- then",00:15:19.470,00:15:23.010
we have to go to note i plus 1.,00:15:23.010,00:15:25.720
"But then the problem is we have
no idea what to write here,",00:15:25.720,00:15:28.515
"because we don't know
what finger we're",00:15:28.515,00:15:30.140
"going to guess
for note i plus 1.",00:15:30.140,00:15:34.200
So this cannot be known.,00:15:34.200,00:15:38.535
"OK, but it's the
first thing you should",00:15:38.535,00:15:41.470
"try, because often this works.",00:15:41.470,00:15:43.940
"For simple DPs, that's
enough for sub-problems.",00:15:43.940,00:15:47.320
"But we need to know
more information",00:15:47.320,00:15:49.640
"about what we're
going to do next.",00:15:49.640,00:15:52.150
"And this seems very
worrisome, maybe",00:15:52.150,00:15:54.120
now we have to guess two things.,00:15:54.120,00:15:55.715
"Do we have to guess
more than two things?",00:15:55.715,00:15:57.900
Turns out two things is enough.,00:15:57.900,00:15:59.210
"But we cannot use
this type of guessing.",00:15:59.210,00:16:01.160
"We need to use-- we need
to add more sub-problems.",00:16:01.160,00:16:05.000
"More sub-problem, more power.",00:16:05.000,00:16:08.560
"So any guesses what we
could do for sub-problem?",00:16:08.560,00:16:12.850
A couple of right answers here.,00:16:15.680,00:16:17.180
Yeah?,00:16:23.485,00:16:24.940
"AUDIENCE: Maybe like all
the suffixes [INAUDIBLE]",00:16:24.940,00:16:28.820
"like the i, for all written i's,
like all the possible fingers",00:16:28.820,00:16:32.640
for i?,00:16:32.640,00:16:33.552
"PROFESSOR: All the
possible fingers",00:16:33.552,00:16:35.010
for i in the sub-problem.,00:16:35.010,00:16:36.051
"Yeah, good.",00:16:36.051,00:16:37.980
"How to play-- it's still
about the suffixes.",00:16:37.980,00:16:43.781
We're still going to use that.,00:16:43.781,00:16:45.030
"But we're going to
suppose we already",00:16:52.709,00:16:54.250
"know what finger to use
for the first note, note i.",00:16:54.250,00:17:02.230
"OK, this is a little weird,
because we were guessing that",00:17:02.230,00:17:04.700
before.,00:17:04.700,00:17:05.970
"Now we're just
supposing someone tells",00:17:05.970,00:17:07.589
"us, use finger f for that note.",00:17:07.589,00:17:11.760
This will work.,00:17:11.760,00:17:12.869
That's the one I had in mind.,00:17:12.869,00:17:15.042
"But the question becomes,
what should we guess?",00:17:15.042,00:17:17.000
Anyone else?,00:17:21.329,00:17:22.731
"You clearly get
[? a pillow. ?] I",00:17:22.731,00:17:24.105
"don't know how many
you have by now.",00:17:24.105,00:17:25.985
Have another one.,00:17:25.985,00:17:28.170
That's tough.,00:17:28.170,00:17:28.950
This is not easy to figure out.,00:17:28.950,00:17:30.560
"Now, given that that's
our sub-problem, what",00:17:33.377,00:17:35.210
is the next thing to guess?,00:17:35.210,00:17:36.470
Do you have an idea?,00:17:46.844,00:17:47.773
"AUDIENCE: I got an
idea to define it.",00:17:47.773,00:17:49.314
"Like either the next or
previous finger for the--",00:17:49.314,00:17:51.445
"PROFESSOR: The next
or previous finger.",00:17:51.445,00:17:53.070
"Well, I'm looking at suffixes.",00:17:53.070,00:17:54.360
"So I only care
about the next one.",00:17:54.360,00:17:56.431
Yeah.,00:17:56.431,00:17:56.930
"I see what you mean
by next or previous.",00:17:59.504,00:18:01.170
"But what we mean
is note i plus 1,",00:18:01.170,00:18:03.320
"that's the next thing
we don't know about.",00:18:03.320,00:18:05.260
"So we're going to
guess finger-- we'll",00:18:05.260,00:18:08.540
call it g-- for note i plus 1.,00:18:08.540,00:18:12.600
"And now magically,
this recurrence",00:18:17.460,00:18:19.750
becomes easy to write.,00:18:19.750,00:18:22.030
So it's almost the same thing.,00:18:22.030,00:18:23.540
"I wish I could just copy and
paste this over, but I can't.",00:18:28.090,00:18:31.850
It's not a digital blackboard.,00:18:31.850,00:18:35.580
Are there digital blackboards?,00:18:35.580,00:18:36.830
That would be cool.,00:18:36.830,00:18:39.080
Someone should make that.,00:18:39.080,00:18:41.140
"I don't know why switched from
open parens to square brackets,",00:18:41.140,00:18:43.795
but I did.,00:18:43.795,00:18:45.440
"Then we have-- I think it's just
the obvious thing, if i plus 1",00:18:45.440,00:18:51.601
g.,00:18:51.601,00:18:52.100
"Ahh, this is a
slightly wrong, though.",00:18:52.100,00:18:55.010
It's a copy paste error.,00:18:55.010,00:18:57.050
"This should really
be DP of i comma",00:18:57.050,00:19:00.420
"f, because now sub-problem
consists of two things-- which",00:19:00.420,00:19:03.020
"suffix am I in, and what's
my finger for note I?",00:19:03.020,00:19:07.260
"And so when I call DP, I also
have to provide two arguments.",00:19:07.260,00:19:11.290
"It's going to be DP
of i plus 1 comma g.",00:19:11.290,00:19:16.250
And then I'm looping over g.,00:19:16.250,00:19:17.630
"I'm trying all
possibilities for g.",00:19:17.630,00:19:20.790
That's the recurrence.,00:19:24.920,00:19:27.600
"So if I want starting
with finger f on note i,",00:19:27.600,00:19:30.870
"how do I solve
the suffix from i?",00:19:30.870,00:19:32.870
"Well, I guess what
finger am I going",00:19:32.870,00:19:36.110
to use for the very next note.,00:19:36.110,00:19:39.120
"Then I have to pay this
transition cost for f on i",00:19:39.120,00:19:42.650
to g on i plus 1.,00:19:42.650,00:19:44.570
"Yeah, OK.",00:19:48.746,00:19:50.670
"So slightly, I'm cheating
the notation here.",00:19:50.670,00:19:53.430
"This probably should be
the note, what is note i,",00:19:53.430,00:19:58.730
"and this thing should be
what is note i plus 1.",00:19:58.730,00:20:01.180
"If you think of this d
function just being given",00:20:04.320,00:20:07.100
"notes, pitches that
you need to play,",00:20:07.100,00:20:09.180
"instead of indices
into the array.",00:20:09.180,00:20:11.235
"It doesn't really matter, but
that's how I defined it before.",00:20:11.235,00:20:14.790
"OK, so I have to pay
this transition cost.",00:20:14.790,00:20:16.540
"What does it take to make that
transition from i to i plus 1?",00:20:16.540,00:20:19.910
"And then what does it take to
do the rest of the notes, given",00:20:19.910,00:20:24.480
"that now my finger is-- or now
finger g is playing the note",00:20:24.480,00:20:29.320
i plus 1?,00:20:29.320,00:20:30.310
"So we transition from
f to g, and that's now",00:20:30.310,00:20:32.910
"kept track of in
the sub-problem.",00:20:32.910,00:20:35.310
"This is the magic of
defining more sub-problem.",00:20:35.310,00:20:37.640
"We needed to know where
our finger used to be.",00:20:37.640,00:20:39.830
"And now we're telling it,
oh, your finger right now",00:20:39.830,00:20:42.280
is finger f.,00:20:42.280,00:20:44.120
"Finger f is the one that's
currently playing the note.",00:20:44.120,00:20:46.372
"And then afterwards, g is
the finger that's currently",00:20:46.372,00:20:48.580
"playing the note, and we
can keep track of that.",00:20:48.580,00:20:50.960
"You could also define
this to say, oh,",00:20:50.960,00:20:52.810
"f was the finger that was
used for the previous note,",00:20:52.810,00:20:55.860
note i minus 1.,00:20:55.860,00:20:56.940
"But it's just a shifting
of the indices here.",00:20:56.940,00:21:00.800
"You can do i minus 1 to i
instead of i to i plus 1.",00:21:00.800,00:21:04.730
"But this is, I think,
slightly cleaner.",00:21:04.730,00:21:06.930
"OK, and then we
have a DP, right?",00:21:09.550,00:21:11.310
"We've just memoized
that recurrence.",00:21:11.310,00:21:13.760
"We get a recursive DP, or
you could build it bottom up.",00:21:13.760,00:21:16.324
"If you were building
it bottom up,",00:21:16.324,00:21:17.740
"you'd want to know
a topological order.",00:21:17.740,00:21:19.680
"And this requires a
little bit of care",00:21:22.650,00:21:25.120
because there's two parameters.,00:21:25.120,00:21:26.860
"And so it's going
to be a for loop",00:21:26.860,00:21:28.290
"over those two
parameters in some order.",00:21:28.290,00:21:30.480
"And I believe the
right order is for i",00:21:30.480,00:21:33.980
"has to go from right to left
because this is suffixes.",00:21:33.980,00:21:37.230
"So I would write reversed range
n python if there are n notes.",00:21:37.230,00:21:46.260
"And then within that loop, I
would do a for loop over f.",00:21:46.260,00:21:49.260
"If you reverse the order
of these for loops,",00:21:52.557,00:21:54.390
"it would not be in the right
order, I'm pretty sure.",00:21:54.390,00:21:57.450
But this one will work.,00:21:57.450,00:21:58.740
You can check it.,00:21:58.740,00:21:59.970
"And then to solve our
original problem, here",00:21:59.970,00:22:07.130
"we require a little
more work because none",00:22:07.130,00:22:13.480
"of these sub-problems
are what we",00:22:13.480,00:22:14.880
"want to solve because we don't
know what the first finger is.",00:22:14.880,00:22:19.899
We know what the first note is.,00:22:19.899,00:22:21.190
That's note 0.,00:22:21.190,00:22:22.570
But what finger goes there?,00:22:22.570,00:22:24.350
I don't know.,00:22:24.350,00:22:24.980
"And DP of 0 requires
us to give it a finger.",00:22:24.980,00:22:30.780
"Give it the finger, ha.",00:22:30.780,00:22:32.650
"Give it the finger for
whatever is the first note.",00:22:32.650,00:22:36.990
So this is pretty easy though.,00:22:36.990,00:22:38.250
"We just take a min
over those choices.",00:22:38.250,00:22:40.505
Which finger should we give it?,00:22:43.390,00:22:44.995
That should do it.,00:22:53.100,00:22:54.200
"So we don't know what
finger to start with.",00:22:54.200,00:22:56.070
"Just try them all, take the min.",00:22:56.070,00:22:58.140
"This is just like the
guessing that we did here,",00:22:58.140,00:23:00.710
just a slightly simpler version.,00:23:00.710,00:23:02.840
"There's no transition cost
because there's no transition.",00:23:02.840,00:23:05.245
We weren't anywhere before.,00:23:05.245,00:23:06.882
"Just what finger
do you start with?",00:23:06.882,00:23:08.340
"I don't care what
finger I start with.",00:23:08.340,00:23:09.923
"It's how I transition from one
note to the next that's hard.",00:23:09.923,00:23:13.730
"OK, done.",00:23:13.730,00:23:17.030
That's the DP.,00:23:17.030,00:23:17.815
"Now, if this is not
obvious or not clear,",00:23:17.815,00:23:21.330
"I think it's easier to think
about it in the DAG form.",00:23:21.330,00:23:26.470
"So let's draw all
the sub problems.",00:23:26.470,00:23:28.390
"We have here a two dimensional
matrix of sub-problems.",00:23:28.390,00:23:32.110
"We have the different
suffixes on the one hand.",00:23:32.110,00:23:35.260
"So this is it, it stats
a 9, goes to n minus 1.",00:23:35.260,00:23:41.230
"And then in the
other dimension, we",00:23:41.230,00:23:43.110
"have what finger
to use from 1 to f.",00:23:43.110,00:23:49.020
"And so in each of these
positions, there a note.",00:23:49.020,00:23:51.654
There's a sub-problem.,00:23:51.654,00:23:52.570
Race.,00:23:59.526,00:24:00.025
"I wanted to get five rows
because there are five fingers.",00:24:04.840,00:24:07.730
"And then our
transitions basically",00:24:07.730,00:24:09.940
"look-- if we're at
finger one on this note,",00:24:09.940,00:24:13.360
"we can go to finger
one on the next note.",00:24:13.360,00:24:16.040
"Or we can go, if
we're not legato,",00:24:16.040,00:24:17.940
"or we can go to finger
two on the next note,",00:24:17.940,00:24:19.910
"or finger three or finger
four or finger five.",00:24:19.910,00:24:22.870
"And then if we're
starting with finger two,",00:24:22.870,00:24:25.367
we could go to any one of these.,00:24:25.367,00:24:26.700
"So you get a complete
bipartite graph,",00:24:26.700,00:24:30.270
"which you usually
draw like this.",00:24:30.270,00:24:33.670
"That is how graph theorists
draw complete bipartite graphs.",00:24:33.670,00:24:38.398
"OK, but I tried to draw a
little more explicitly here.",00:24:38.398,00:24:40.750
"It's just any
possible transition.",00:24:40.750,00:24:42.220
"And for each of
these, the point is",00:24:42.220,00:24:43.870
"you can compute the
D cost, because you",00:24:43.870,00:24:45.817
know what figure you were at.,00:24:45.817,00:24:47.210
"You know what finger
you are going to",00:24:47.210,00:24:49.674
"and what note
you're starting from",00:24:49.674,00:24:51.090
and what note you're going to.,00:24:51.090,00:24:52.780
"Those are the four
arguments you need for D.",00:24:52.780,00:24:55.580
"So you put those
weights on, and then",00:24:55.580,00:24:57.370
"you solve shortest
paths on this DAG.",00:24:57.370,00:25:00.480
"And that is exactly what
this DP is doing, OK?",00:25:00.480,00:25:06.350
"Except there's no
single source here,",00:25:06.350,00:25:08.590
which is kind of annoying.,00:25:08.590,00:25:09.950
"And so you need to take
this min over what's",00:25:09.950,00:25:12.691
"the shortest path from
here, what's the shortest",00:25:12.691,00:25:14.690
"path from here, from here,
from here, from here.",00:25:14.690,00:25:16.754
"Of course, you
don't actually need",00:25:16.754,00:25:18.170
"to do that by running single
source shortest paths f times.",00:25:18.170,00:25:23.830
"If you're a clever
shortest paths person,",00:25:23.830,00:25:26.660
"you would add an extra
source note, connect",00:25:26.660,00:25:29.190
"that with 0 weight to
all of these sources.",00:25:29.190,00:25:35.460
So put 0s on there.,00:25:35.460,00:25:38.090
"And then do single
shortest paths from here.",00:25:38.090,00:25:40.650
And you will find the best way.,00:25:40.650,00:25:42.040
"You don't really care
where you started,",00:25:42.040,00:25:43.706
"so this is trying
all the options.",00:25:43.706,00:25:45.660
"That's exactly what
we're doing here.",00:25:45.660,00:25:47.754
"But here I'm doing it with
the shortest paths trick,",00:25:47.754,00:25:49.920
"here I'm doing it with guessing
and taking a min like DP style.",00:25:49.920,00:25:56.030
"OK, so that's how to do
piano figuring and guitar",00:25:56.030,00:26:01.560
"fingering for single
hand, one note at time.",00:26:01.560,00:26:04.660
Questions?,00:26:04.660,00:26:05.799
"And this even worse
for aliens if you",00:26:05.799,00:26:07.340
"have arbitrarily many
fingers on your hand.",00:26:07.340,00:26:09.570
"I guess we should figure
out what's the running time.",00:26:09.570,00:26:13.130
So we have sub-problems.,00:26:13.130,00:26:15.670
"We see how many
sub-problems there are here.",00:26:15.670,00:26:17.920
There's n times f sub-problems.,00:26:17.920,00:26:22.000
"How much time, or how
many choices are there",00:26:22.000,00:26:24.810
for our guess?,00:26:24.810,00:26:26.160
"Well there's f different
choices for what finger we use.",00:26:26.160,00:26:31.800
"And when we do this min,
we spend theta F time.",00:26:31.800,00:26:35.640
"Because there's a
for loop over F,",00:26:40.710,00:26:42.220
"we're doing constant
work assuming",00:26:42.220,00:26:43.636
D lookups take constant time.,00:26:43.636,00:26:45.760
This is theta F time.,00:26:45.760,00:26:46.800
"So we multiply those
two things together,",00:26:46.800,00:26:49.520
"and we get the total time, the
number of sub-problems which",00:26:49.520,00:26:53.570
"is n times F, and
we multiply them",00:26:53.570,00:26:56.320
by theta F for each sub-problem.,00:26:56.320,00:26:58.840
So this is nF squared.,00:26:58.840,00:27:02.510
"And given F is usually pretty
small, it's almost linear time.",00:27:02.510,00:27:09.100
"So that's a pretty
good algorithm.",00:27:09.100,00:27:10.530
"But in reality, you tend
to play multiple notes",00:27:18.460,00:27:22.202
at the same time.,00:27:22.202,00:27:22.910
"In music, typically
you're playing a chord.",00:27:26.035,00:27:29.270
"With piano, you're
playing several notes",00:27:29.270,00:27:33.550
"with one hand, maybe several
notes with another hand.",00:27:33.550,00:27:36.840
"Two handed piano, it's crazy.",00:27:36.840,00:27:38.360
"You could do four handed piano,
make it a little more exciting.",00:27:38.360,00:27:41.000
"With the guitar, play-- I
don't know very many chords,",00:27:41.000,00:27:44.393
but I know at least one.,00:27:44.393,00:27:47.290
"You play, I don't know.",00:27:47.290,00:27:49.000
This looks like something.,00:27:49.000,00:27:52.115
That's a G chord.,00:27:52.115,00:27:53.702
Do I know any others?,00:27:53.702,00:27:56.700
And that's an E chord.,00:27:56.700,00:27:59.499
"All right, you get the idea.",00:27:59.499,00:28:03.585
"I mean, for each
of these chords,",00:28:03.585,00:28:04.960
"different people use
different fingers,",00:28:04.960,00:28:06.260
even for a single cord.,00:28:06.260,00:28:07.260
"So it's sort of a
personal taste how",00:28:07.260,00:28:09.010
"you're going to define
your difficulty measure.",00:28:09.010,00:28:11.490
"But I could play an E like
this, or I could-- I don't know,",00:28:11.490,00:28:15.150
play it like this.,00:28:15.150,00:28:17.040
Or I could play like this.,00:28:17.040,00:28:21.180
"And there's lots of crazy
ways to put your finger here",00:28:21.180,00:28:24.100
"and your finger here
and your finger here.",00:28:24.100,00:28:26.120
"And for each of them, you
could define some difficulty.",00:28:26.120,00:28:28.480
"And then, of course,
is a transition",00:28:28.480,00:28:29.979
from one chord to another.,00:28:29.979,00:28:31.530
"And because there's different
ways to play different chords,",00:28:31.530,00:28:33.290
"that wasn't a very good
example because they all",00:28:33.290,00:28:35.290
look pretty bad.,00:28:35.290,00:28:37.730
"Well, this one for example,
this is the G again.",00:28:37.730,00:28:41.320
"I could use my-- one, two,
three, four-- fourth finger",00:28:41.320,00:28:45.630
"here, or I could
use my fifth finger.",00:28:45.630,00:28:48.645
"My instructor says we should
use our pinky because people",00:28:48.645,00:28:51.020
tend not to use their pinky.,00:28:51.020,00:28:52.186
"But it makes a
difference what I'm",00:28:52.186,00:28:53.834
going to transition to next.,00:28:53.834,00:28:55.000
"Maybe my pinky really
needs to go over here next",00:28:55.000,00:28:56.999
"and I should free
it up for later,",00:28:56.999,00:28:58.480
"or maybe it's better if this
one's freed because then I",00:28:58.480,00:29:01.060
can move it somewhere else.,00:29:01.060,00:29:02.620
"So that's what we'd
like to capture",00:29:02.620,00:29:04.640
"in a generalized form
or this dynamic program,",00:29:04.640,00:29:07.010
and we can do it.,00:29:07.010,00:29:08.980
"So I'll try to do
it quickly so we",00:29:08.980,00:29:12.360
"can get on to the
other examples.",00:29:12.360,00:29:14.320
"All right, other fun stuff.",00:29:14.320,00:29:16.142
"Actually, there's
another fun thing",00:29:16.142,00:29:17.600
"with guitar, which
is that there's",00:29:17.600,00:29:20.310
"more than one way
to play each note.",00:29:20.310,00:29:22.740
There are six strings here.,00:29:22.740,00:29:24.330
"And you could play like this
note for the Super Mario",00:29:24.330,00:29:29.530
Brothers.,00:29:29.530,00:29:30.460
"I could also play that
doing the fifth thing here.",00:29:30.460,00:29:34.720
"It's slightly out of tune, but
those sound almost the same.",00:29:34.720,00:29:39.970
"Or I could play on the 10th
fret on the third string.",00:29:39.970,00:29:44.850
That's the same as bottom one.,00:29:44.850,00:29:46.300
"So a lot of options, so you
also like to capture that.",00:29:46.300,00:29:50.710
This is actually not too hard.,00:29:50.710,00:29:52.260
"You just need to generalize
the notion of finger",00:29:52.260,00:30:02.000
"to what finger you're using
and what string you're using.",00:30:02.000,00:30:07.570
"So there are f different choices
for what finger you're using.",00:30:07.570,00:30:10.744
"If you use a generalized
guitar, there's",00:30:10.744,00:30:12.410
"s choices for what
string you're playing.",00:30:12.410,00:30:14.145
"There's a lot of different
guitars with various numbers",00:30:14.145,00:30:16.436
"of strings, so we can
just generalize that.",00:30:16.436,00:30:18.451
"And now it's not only, which
finger am I going to use,",00:30:18.451,00:30:20.700
"but what sting
will I play it on?",00:30:20.700,00:30:22.220
"And then you can still
define a difficulty measure",00:30:22.220,00:30:26.390
"like this for this
set up, depending",00:30:26.390,00:30:29.704
"both on the finger
and the string.",00:30:29.704,00:30:31.120
"And then the running
time grows slightly.",00:30:31.120,00:30:34.890
"It's now n times F
squared S squared,",00:30:34.890,00:30:39.320
"because now I have to take
the product of F and S. OK,",00:30:39.320,00:30:41.760
so that's first thing.,00:30:41.760,00:30:42.950
"But then if I wanted
to do multiple notes,",00:30:42.950,00:30:50.990
"well, you can imagine it's
a similar type of deal.",00:30:50.990,00:30:54.390
It's going to get harder though.,00:30:54.390,00:30:56.992
"First thing we need to
generalize is the input.",00:30:56.992,00:30:58.950
"Before the input was
a sequence of notes.",00:30:58.950,00:31:02.190
"Now it's going to be a
sequence of multi-notes.",00:31:02.190,00:31:05.780
"So notes of i is now
going to be, let's say,",00:31:05.780,00:31:11.110
"a list of notes that all
need to be played at once.",00:31:11.110,00:31:16.400
"And conveniently, it's probably
going to be, at most, F notes,",00:31:16.400,00:31:19.330
"because you really can only
play one note with each finger",00:31:19.330,00:31:23.260
pretty much.,00:31:23.260,00:31:24.110
"I guess you could try to
play two notes at once",00:31:24.110,00:31:26.220
"on a piano with
a finger, but eh.",00:31:26.220,00:31:28.477
It sounds difficult.,00:31:28.477,00:31:29.310
"For a guitar, it's
at most s notes.",00:31:29.310,00:31:33.980
"You can only play one note
per string, more or less.",00:31:33.980,00:31:38.330
So that's our input.,00:31:38.330,00:31:42.660
"And now we need to adjust
the dynamic program.",00:31:42.660,00:31:45.550
"And I think I'll tell
you how to do this.",00:31:49.910,00:31:52.240
"Basically, now you need to know
where all your fingers are.",00:32:24.410,00:32:26.870
"So you go from one
pose to another pose,",00:32:26.870,00:32:31.140
from one chord to another.,00:32:31.140,00:32:32.760
Different ways to finger that.,00:32:32.760,00:32:34.062
"Which fingers are
and which strings",00:32:34.062,00:32:35.520
"and which frets on the
guitar, which fingers",00:32:35.520,00:32:39.040
"are on which keys
on the keyboard.",00:32:39.040,00:32:41.220
"But you just need
to know all that.",00:32:41.220,00:32:43.140
"And all your fingers
might be doing something,",00:32:43.140,00:32:46.540
"and you've got to know for
each finger what note is it on,",00:32:46.540,00:32:49.080
or is it not being used at all.,00:32:49.080,00:32:51.290
"So how many different ways to
do such a mapping are there?",00:32:51.290,00:32:54.370
"I mean, this is just a function.",00:32:54.370,00:32:56.240
"So it's the number of
targets of the function.",00:32:56.240,00:32:59.250
So how many of these are there.,00:32:59.250,00:33:03.110
"Gosh, well, I guess we said
there are, at most, f notes.",00:33:03.110,00:33:06.880
"So f plus 1 is the maximum
number of possible things",00:33:06.880,00:33:12.530
each finger can do.,00:33:12.530,00:33:13.660
"And we raise that to the power
of the number of fingers.",00:33:13.660,00:33:16.520
"That's the possible mappings
of what all of my fingers",00:33:16.520,00:33:19.470
could be doing.,00:33:19.470,00:33:20.375
"It's exponential
in f, not so great.",00:33:20.375,00:33:22.300
"But if f is 5, it's all right.",00:33:22.300,00:33:25.140
"And then-- well, then you
just generalize the rest.",00:33:25.140,00:33:28.050
"I don't think I'll
write it down in detail.",00:33:28.050,00:33:30.890
"But our sub-problems
now are going",00:33:30.890,00:33:33.030
"to be-- let me
switch boards here.",00:33:33.030,00:33:37.000
"How do we play these
multi-notes from i onwards,",00:33:40.700,00:33:46.130
"given that we're going to
use that pose-- or I called",00:33:46.130,00:33:48.930
"it the state of all my fingers--
for the first notes of i",00:33:48.930,00:33:54.540
is now a whole bunch of notes.,00:33:54.540,00:33:56.160
"So given I'm now going
to play those notes",00:33:56.160,00:33:57.909
"with this particular
finger assignment,",00:33:57.909,00:34:01.910
how do I play the rest?,00:34:01.910,00:34:04.280
"And then what we'll guess is
the entire finger assignment",00:34:04.280,00:34:07.560
"for the next set of
notes, i plus 1--",00:34:07.560,00:34:09.630
"the next chord, if you will.",00:34:09.630,00:34:11.929
"And that guessing involves
now F plus 1 to the F time.",00:34:11.929,00:34:17.071
"And then we just write the
recurrence in the same way.",00:34:17.071,00:34:19.320
"So we're basically generalizing
here we call the finger,",00:34:19.320,00:34:22.480
"now it's an entire
pose for your hand.",00:34:22.480,00:34:25.760
"Instead of F, you might write
H for hand or something.",00:34:25.760,00:34:28.949
"And so the running
time in this situation",00:34:28.949,00:34:31.969
"is going to go up to something
like n times F of plus",00:34:31.969,00:34:36.630
1 to the F. Did I miss anything?,00:34:36.630,00:34:42.382
Probably have to square that.,00:34:42.382,00:34:43.590
2F.,00:34:46.270,00:34:47.766
"Before it was F
squared, now it's",00:34:47.766,00:34:49.140
just F plus 1 to the F squared.,00:34:49.140,00:34:51.360
"So if F is small,
this is all right.",00:34:51.360,00:34:52.860
"Otherwise, not so great.",00:34:52.860,00:34:53.900

"Then I can
retroactively figure out",00:35:20.280,00:35:21.738
why using the dynamic program.,00:35:21.738,00:35:23.812

move on to Tetris.",00:35:23.812,00:35:25.270
"All these problems are going
to have the same flavor.",00:35:33.662,00:35:35.870
"You can solve them
with basically",00:35:35.870,00:35:37.130
the same dynamic program.,00:35:37.130,00:35:38.171
"It's all about figuring out
what should the sub-problems be.",00:35:38.171,00:35:41.900
"So let me-- does anyone
here not know Tetris?",00:35:41.900,00:35:45.312
"OK, good.",00:35:45.312,00:35:45.980
No one's willing to admit it.,00:35:45.980,00:35:47.595
"So you've got these
blocks falling.",00:35:47.595,00:35:49.170
"But I'm going to make several
artificial constraints.",00:35:49.170,00:35:53.640
"First of all, I tell
you the entire sequence",00:35:53.640,00:35:56.426
"of pieces that
are going to come.",00:35:56.426,00:35:57.800
"This is more like
a Tetris puzzle.",00:35:57.800,00:35:59.220
"OK, we're given sequence
of n pieces that will fall.",00:36:02.320,00:36:08.510
"For each of them, we must
drop the piece from the top.",00:36:08.510,00:36:12.090
"OK, and if you're a
fancy Tetris player,",00:36:15.660,00:36:18.900
"you can let a piece fall and
then rotate it at very end",00:36:18.900,00:36:21.500
"to do some clever, clever thing.",00:36:21.500,00:36:23.610
I disallow that.,00:36:23.610,00:36:24.464
"You always have to
push the drop button.",00:36:24.464,00:36:26.130
"So the piece starts here, it
goes instantly to the ground.",00:36:26.130,00:36:29.330
This will be necessary.,00:36:29.330,00:36:30.400
"I don't know how to
solve the problem",00:36:30.400,00:36:31.941
without this constraint.,00:36:31.941,00:36:33.740
"OK, and then the
other weird thing--",00:36:33.740,00:36:37.410
"this is very weird for Tetris--
full rows normally clear,",00:36:37.410,00:36:41.710
but now they don't clear.,00:36:41.710,00:36:44.880
This is like hardcore Tetris.,00:36:44.880,00:36:46.700
"You're guaranteed
to die eventually.",00:36:46.700,00:36:48.640
"The question is, can you
survive these n pieces?",00:36:48.640,00:36:53.287
That's the question.,00:36:53.287,00:36:54.120
Can you survive?,00:36:54.120,00:36:54.786
"Oh, I've got one
other constraint.",00:36:57.462,00:36:59.310
"This is actually
kind of natural.",00:36:59.310,00:37:02.240
"The width of the board is
small, relatively small,",00:37:02.240,00:37:07.200
"because we're going to
be exponential in w.",00:37:07.200,00:37:09.410
"In real life it's 12, I think?",00:37:09.410,00:37:12.137
AUDIENCE: Ten.,00:37:12.137,00:37:12.720
"PROFESSOR: Ten, sorry.",00:37:12.720,00:37:13.865
"It's been a while since
I wrote my Tetris paper.",00:37:13.865,00:37:17.030
"So all right, these are all
kind of weird constraints.",00:37:17.030,00:37:20.070
"If you don't make all of
these constraints-- oh,",00:37:20.070,00:37:22.730
"also the board is
initially empty.",00:37:22.730,00:37:25.110
That's like level one of Tetris.,00:37:25.110,00:37:26.770
"If all of these things
are not the case, which",00:37:34.170,00:37:36.460
"is regular Tetris, if you
just have the first thing",00:37:36.460,00:37:39.314
"then this problem is
called NP-complete.",00:37:39.314,00:37:40.980
"We'll be defining
that next class.",00:37:40.980,00:37:42.730
"So it's computationally
intractable.",00:37:42.730,00:37:45.562
"But if you make all
of these assumptions,",00:37:45.562,00:37:47.270
"the problem becomes
easy, and you",00:37:47.270,00:37:49.940
"can do it by
dynamic programming.",00:37:49.940,00:37:53.260
So how do we do it?,00:37:53.260,00:37:57.240
"We define sub-problems
just like before.",00:37:57.240,00:38:00.490
"The obvious thing
to try is suffixes.",00:38:00.490,00:38:02.080
"How do we play a suffix
of pieces i onwards?",00:38:07.230,00:38:13.900
How to play those guys.,00:38:13.900,00:38:18.330
"And just like fingering, this is
not enough information, right?",00:38:18.330,00:38:23.600
"Because if we're going to play
from pieces i onward, what",00:38:23.600,00:38:26.130
"we need to now is what the
board currently looks like.",00:38:26.130,00:38:28.410
"I said here the board
is initially empty.",00:38:28.410,00:38:30.312
"That's not going to
be the case after you",00:38:30.312,00:38:32.020
place the very first piece.,00:38:32.020,00:38:33.672
"So in general, after we've
placed the first i pieces,",00:38:33.672,00:38:35.880
"we need to know what
the board looks like.",00:38:35.880,00:38:38.972
"And here's where I'm going to
use all of these assumptions.",00:38:38.972,00:38:41.430
"If you always drop things from
the top and rows don't clear,",00:38:41.430,00:38:46.380
"then all you really care about
is how high each column is.",00:38:46.380,00:38:51.455
"This is what you might call
the skyline of the board.",00:38:51.455,00:38:54.980
"OK, now in reality,
there might be holes here",00:38:58.140,00:39:02.220
"because you drop
things in silly ways.",00:39:02.220,00:39:03.885
"Maybe you drop a
piece like this.",00:39:03.885,00:39:07.030
"And then I claim, because
I'm dropping things",00:39:07.030,00:39:09.090
"from infinity from
the sky, I really",00:39:09.090,00:39:12.339
"don't care about that
there's a whole here.",00:39:12.339,00:39:14.130
"I can just fill that in and
say, OK, that's my new skyline.",00:39:14.130,00:39:17.150
"Because if you can't do
these last minute twists",00:39:17.150,00:39:19.300
"and if lines never clear,
that's going to be gone.",00:39:19.300,00:39:22.580
That material is wasted.,00:39:22.580,00:39:25.380
"OK, so all I need to remember
is how high is each column.",00:39:25.380,00:39:30.630
"So I should say given
the board skyline.",00:39:30.630,00:39:38.882
"Now, how many choices
are there for that?",00:39:38.882,00:39:40.590
"It's quite similar to this
function, the fingering.",00:39:40.590,00:39:45.220
Let's see.,00:39:45.220,00:39:45.720
"There's the height of the
board, different choices.",00:39:45.720,00:39:48.970
It's going to be h.,00:39:48.970,00:39:50.892
"For each column it could be
anywhere between 0 and h,",00:39:50.892,00:39:53.100
"so I guess h plus 1 if
you want to get technical.",00:39:53.100,00:39:56.090
"And then we raise
it to the power w,",00:39:56.090,00:39:57.840
"because there's w different
columns and each of them",00:39:57.840,00:40:00.860
is independent choice.,00:40:00.860,00:40:03.697
"So this is going to n times
that different sub-problems.",00:40:03.697,00:40:06.030
"And here's what I
need the is small",00:40:10.870,00:40:12.850
"because this is
exponential in w.",00:40:12.850,00:40:14.330
"So it's reasonable in
h, but exponential in w.",00:40:14.330,00:40:18.780
"OK, then what do I guess?",00:40:18.780,00:40:21.880
Any suggestions what to guess?,00:40:21.880,00:40:23.265
"AUDIENCE: So where the new
piece falls, as in [INAUDIBLE]?",00:40:38.380,00:40:43.184
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:40:43.184,00:40:43.850
What should I do with piece i?,00:40:43.850,00:40:46.530
There's not that many choices.,00:40:46.530,00:40:47.980
"I can rotate it zero,
one, two, or three times.",00:40:47.980,00:40:51.640
"I can choose
someplace to drop it,",00:40:51.640,00:40:53.170
but those are my only choices.,00:40:53.170,00:40:55.456
"So it's just how
to play piece i.",00:40:55.456,00:41:01.060
"And given that guess,
you can figure out",00:41:01.060,00:41:02.870
"how the skyline updates,
like I did here.",00:41:02.870,00:41:05.900
"If I drop that piece like
that, then I fill in this part",00:41:05.900,00:41:08.730
and recompute my new skyline.,00:41:08.730,00:41:09.965
"So it's going to
be something like 4",00:41:12.590,00:41:14.120
"times w different choices,
roughly-- 4 for the rotation,",00:41:14.120,00:41:19.705
w for the x-coordinate.,00:41:19.705,00:41:20.663
"And so the running
time is just going",00:41:23.170,00:41:24.840
to be the product of these.,00:41:24.840,00:41:26.010
"n times w times h
plus 1 to the w.",00:41:42.220,00:41:49.030
"Open problem, if I drop any
one of these assumptions,",00:41:49.030,00:41:53.810
"can you get a dynamic
program that's reasonable?",00:41:53.810,00:41:56.400
Could you do it if w is large?,00:41:56.400,00:41:58.040
I don't know.,00:41:58.040,00:41:58.955
Could you do if rows do clear?,00:41:58.955,00:42:02.220

natural constraint here.",00:42:02.220,00:42:04.779
I don't know.,00:42:04.779,00:42:05.320
Puzzle for you to think about.,00:42:07.850,00:42:09.330
I'd love to know the answer.,00:42:09.330,00:42:10.496
"You can obviously do the
rest of the steps, right?",00:42:16.780,00:42:19.004
"You can write down
the recurrence.",00:42:19.004,00:42:20.420
It's the same thing.,00:42:20.420,00:42:21.253
"You take the min
over all guesses.",00:42:21.253,00:42:23.850
What are we minimizing?,00:42:23.850,00:42:25.080
Hmm.,00:42:25.080,00:42:25.710
"I guess here the
question is survival.",00:42:25.710,00:42:29.700
Can you survive?,00:42:29.700,00:42:31.580
"So this is one of the first
examples where the answer is",00:42:31.580,00:42:34.270
"a Boolean value, true or false.",00:42:34.270,00:42:37.470
"But if you think of true
or false as 0 and 1,",00:42:37.470,00:42:40.050
"then it's still a
maximization problem.",00:42:40.050,00:42:43.086
You want to maximize.,00:42:43.086,00:42:43.960
You want 1 if possible.,00:42:43.960,00:42:45.120
"Otherwise, you'll get
0 when you maximize.",00:42:45.120,00:42:47.630
"So you can write the
recurrence using max.",00:42:47.630,00:42:50.320
"And in the base case, you have
truth values, true or false.",00:42:50.320,00:42:53.880

Did I die?,00:42:55.530,00:42:56.980

can play it on an emulator",00:43:20.980,00:43:23.700
and just see how it is.,00:43:23.700,00:43:27.430
"So what I'm going
to talk about next,",00:43:27.430,00:43:29.520
"in theory, works for many
different platform games,",00:43:29.520,00:43:31.900
side-scrolling platform games.,00:43:31.900,00:43:34.320
"But Super Mario Brothers
1 has some nice features.",00:43:34.320,00:43:39.140
"In particular, a nice feature
is that whenever anything",00:43:39.140,00:43:41.840
"moves off of the screen, it
disappears from the world.",00:43:41.840,00:43:46.460
"So the monster moves
off, it's gone.",00:43:46.460,00:43:48.190
"You can think of there's
a static level there.",00:43:51.410,00:43:53.560
"When the level comes into
screen, when a monster comes",00:43:53.560,00:43:56.140
"on screen, then
it starts acting.",00:43:56.140,00:43:58.389
"But as soon as you move the
screen-- you can't actually",00:43:58.389,00:44:00.680
"move backwards in Super
Mario 1, but as soon",00:44:00.680,00:44:02.513
"as you move forwards and
that character is offscreen,",00:44:02.513,00:44:05.570
it's gone.,00:44:05.570,00:44:06.630
"So in a sense, that
part of the level",00:44:06.630,00:44:08.171
reset to its initial state.,00:44:08.171,00:44:09.560
"Now, as long as your screen is
not too big-- and thankfully,",00:44:09.560,00:44:12.960
"on NES screens
were not very big.",00:44:12.960,00:44:14.700
"It's 320p, or whatever.",00:44:14.700,00:44:18.030
This will work.,00:44:18.030,00:44:21.270
"If you are given
the entire level--",00:44:21.270,00:44:27.430
"so let's say there's n
bits of information there--",00:44:27.430,00:44:30.900
"and you have a small screen,
w by h screen, w and h",00:44:30.900,00:44:38.000
are not too big.,00:44:38.000,00:44:39.580
"Then I claim we can
solve Super Mario",00:44:39.580,00:44:42.100
Brothers by dynamic programming.,00:44:42.100,00:44:43.440
"So let's say we want
to maximize our score.",00:44:43.440,00:44:46.101
"Want to run through the level
and maximize your score,",00:44:46.101,00:44:48.350
"or you want to minimize
the amount of time you use.",00:44:48.350,00:44:50.160
You're doing level runs.,00:44:50.160,00:44:51.230
"Pick your favorite measure,
all of those can be solved.",00:44:51.230,00:44:54.515
"And the way to do it, this
sort of general approach",00:44:54.515,00:44:56.640
"to all these DPs is
we need to write down",00:44:56.640,00:44:58.840
"what do I need to know
about the game state.",00:44:58.840,00:45:01.325
I'll call that a configuration.,00:45:01.325,00:45:02.616
"What can we care about
for Super Mario Brothers?",00:45:05.780,00:45:07.780
"Well, I guess
everything on screen.",00:45:07.780,00:45:13.190
"This is a bit tricky, but
there's stuff on screen.",00:45:17.280,00:45:20.629
There are monsters and objects.,00:45:20.629,00:45:21.920
"For the monsters, I need to
know their current position.",00:45:21.920,00:45:24.253
"For the objects, I
need to know-- like,",00:45:24.253,00:45:26.292
is there a question mark box?,00:45:26.292,00:45:27.500
Did I hit it already?,00:45:27.500,00:45:28.910
"Did I already get the coin or
did I already get the mushroom?",00:45:28.910,00:45:31.880
"So for each of those
things, there's",00:45:31.880,00:45:33.910
"some amount of information
you need to store.",00:45:33.910,00:45:35.940
How much information?,00:45:35.940,00:45:38.980
"I think something like constant
to the w times h should do.",00:45:38.980,00:45:45.000
"That's saying for every
pixel on the screen",00:45:45.000,00:45:47.084
"or for every square
on the screen,",00:45:47.084,00:45:48.500
"however you-- whatever you
define the resolution here",00:45:48.500,00:45:50.790
to be.,00:45:50.790,00:45:51.290
"Let's say for every little
unit square in Mario land,",00:45:51.290,00:45:54.800
is it a brick?,00:45:54.800,00:45:56.750
"Is it a hard brick, or has
it been a destroyed brick?",00:45:56.750,00:46:01.640
Is a monster there right now?,00:46:01.640,00:46:03.490
Is Mario there right now?,00:46:03.490,00:46:04.850
All these kinds of information.,00:46:04.850,00:46:07.300
"OK, so there's a cost number
of choices for each pixel.",00:46:07.300,00:46:10.580
You can write them all down.,00:46:10.580,00:46:12.340
"You might also want
Mario's velocity.",00:46:12.340,00:46:16.880
"I had to play it
again just to check",00:46:16.880,00:46:18.860
that there is indeed velocity.,00:46:18.860,00:46:20.400
"Turning around is slower
than going forward.",00:46:20.400,00:46:23.260
You do accelerate a little bit.,00:46:23.260,00:46:24.700
So you've got to remember that.,00:46:24.700,00:46:25.790
"There's probably only
a constant number",00:46:25.790,00:46:27.415
"of choices for what
your velocity is.",00:46:27.415,00:46:30.840
What else?,00:46:30.840,00:46:33.408
"Ah, I want to
remember the score.",00:46:33.408,00:46:36.710
You want to maximize score.,00:46:36.710,00:46:38.120
"And let's say you also--
how much time is left.",00:46:38.120,00:46:40.577
There's a time counter.,00:46:40.577,00:46:41.535
"If it hits zero, you die.",00:46:41.535,00:46:43.510
"Now, these are kind of annoying,
because they're integers.",00:46:43.510,00:46:46.460
They could be kind of large.,00:46:46.460,00:46:48.300
"So I'm going to say the
score could be capital S big,",00:46:48.300,00:46:51.010
and time could be capital T big.,00:46:51.010,00:46:53.510
"So this'll be a
pseudopolynomial algorithm.",00:46:53.510,00:46:56.720
"The number of
configurations in total",00:46:56.720,00:46:58.520
"here is the product
of these things.",00:46:58.520,00:47:00.320
It's exponential in w and h.,00:47:00.320,00:47:03.980
"And then multiply by
S and T. So that's",00:47:03.980,00:47:09.420
the number of configurations.,00:47:09.420,00:47:11.390
"And that's also going
to be our sub-problem.",00:47:11.390,00:47:13.500
"I guess we should
also write down",00:47:13.500,00:47:15.910
"where is the screen
relative to the level.",00:47:15.910,00:47:21.310
"OK, how far to the
right have you gone?",00:47:21.310,00:47:24.270
That's another w.,00:47:24.270,00:47:25.420
That's not a big deal.,00:47:28.710,00:47:30.030
"OK, given this information,
you know everything",00:47:30.030,00:47:32.270
"you need to know about
playing from here on.",00:47:32.270,00:47:35.580
"And the time counter's
always going to keep ticking.",00:47:35.580,00:47:38.140
"So you can draw a graph
of all configurations,",00:47:38.140,00:47:41.190
"just enumerate all
of these things.",00:47:41.190,00:47:42.800
It's this many of them.,00:47:42.800,00:47:44.550
"And then draw, for
every configuration,",00:47:44.550,00:47:47.240
"what are the possible
things I can do?",00:47:47.240,00:47:48.960
I could push this button.,00:47:48.960,00:47:50.040
"I can push the A button, I
can release the A button.",00:47:50.040,00:47:52.080
"I can push the B button, I
can release the B button.",00:47:52.080,00:47:54.246
I can push the up arrow.,00:47:54.246,00:47:55.487
"Those are all the
things you could do.",00:47:55.487,00:47:57.070
"It's a constant
number of choices.",00:47:57.070,00:47:58.820
"So each vertex will have
constant out degree.",00:47:58.820,00:48:01.500
"If you did this, what
configuration would I reach?",00:48:01.500,00:48:04.335
Just draw that whole graph.,00:48:04.335,00:48:05.620
Do shortest paths.,00:48:05.620,00:48:07.840
"Or dynamic programming,
these are your sub-problems.",00:48:07.840,00:48:11.626
There are no suffixes here.,00:48:11.626,00:48:12.750
These are your sub-problem.,00:48:12.750,00:48:14.760
"And then you take
a max, if you're",00:48:14.760,00:48:18.410
"trying to maximize score or max
if you're trying to maximize",00:48:18.410,00:48:20.910
"time, minimize the time you use.",00:48:20.910,00:48:23.440
This is time remaining.,00:48:23.440,00:48:25.580
"And you can relate
each sub-problem",00:48:25.580,00:48:27.229
"to a constant number
of other sub-problems.",00:48:27.229,00:48:29.020
"So your running
time will be this,",00:48:29.020,00:48:30.436
"because you only pay constant
time per sub-problem.",00:48:30.436,00:48:33.270
"And now you can solve Super
Mario Brothers optimally,",00:48:33.270,00:48:35.540
"as long as your screen is
not too big and as long",00:48:35.540,00:48:37.957
"as your scores and times
don't get too big either,",00:48:37.957,00:48:40.040
"because we're only
pseudopolynomial with respect",00:48:40.040,00:48:42.040
to S and T.,00:48:42.040,00:48:43.990
Questions?,00:48:43.990,00:48:46.700
All right.,00:48:46.700,00:48:47.200
That's-- yeah?,00:48:47.200,00:48:48.140
"AUDIENCE: So are we
going to be trying",00:48:48.140,00:48:51.593
"to memoize all of these
possible configurations?",00:48:51.593,00:48:56.059
"PROFESSOR: If you do
the recursive version,",00:48:56.059,00:48:57.850
"you will end up memoizing all
of these configuration values.",00:48:57.850,00:49:00.820
"Well, anyone that's reachable
from the initial state.",00:49:00.820,00:49:04.009
"Some configurations
might not be reachable,",00:49:04.009,00:49:05.800
"but the ones that
are reachable you're",00:49:05.800,00:49:08.090
