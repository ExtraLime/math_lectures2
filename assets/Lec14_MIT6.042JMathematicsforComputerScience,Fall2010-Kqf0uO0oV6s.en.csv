"TOM LEIGHTON: This
week we're going",00:00:22.802,00:00:24.260
"to talk about recurrences,
how to set them up,",00:00:24.260,00:00:26.940
"how to model a problem
as a recurrent problem,",00:00:26.940,00:00:29.570
and then how to solve them.,00:00:29.570,00:00:31.950
"This stuff is really useful when
you get into algorithm design",00:00:31.950,00:00:35.160
and algorithm analysis.,00:00:35.160,00:00:36.770
"6006 and 6046, we you
use this stuff a lot.",00:00:36.770,00:00:41.060
"We're going to start with a very
famous recurrent problem known",00:00:41.060,00:00:44.290
as the Towers of Hanoi problem.,00:00:44.290,00:00:46.430
"And I'm guessing
that many of you",00:00:46.430,00:00:47.920
"have seen this problem
in one form or another.",00:00:47.920,00:00:51.300
"In the Tower of
Hanoi problem, you've",00:00:51.300,00:00:54.030
"got three pegs and n disks,
these little guys here.",00:00:54.030,00:01:00.260
All different sizes.,00:01:00.260,00:01:02.040
"And the object is to start
with a stack like this",00:01:02.040,00:01:07.340
"and move the disks
around so they wind up",00:01:07.340,00:01:09.990
with the stack on another disk.,00:01:09.990,00:01:13.640
"Now, the rules are you can
only move one disk at a time.",00:01:13.640,00:01:18.750
"And you can never put a big
disk over a little disk.",00:01:18.750,00:01:22.270
So that you can't do.,00:01:22.270,00:01:24.720
So that would have to go there.,00:01:24.720,00:01:26.900
Then you could do this.,00:01:26.900,00:01:29.200
"And now I've gotten the
top two moved over to here.",00:01:29.200,00:01:34.220
"And the goal is to take
the minimum number of moves",00:01:34.220,00:01:37.650
"to get the whole stack
moved over to here,",00:01:37.650,00:01:40.980
"and to even figure
out if that's doable.",00:01:40.980,00:01:45.010
"Now, this was invented by a
famous French mathematician",00:01:45.010,00:01:51.910
named Edward Lucas in 1883.,00:01:51.910,00:01:55.470
"And in the original
legend around this puzzle,",00:01:55.470,00:01:58.750
there were 64 disks.,00:01:58.750,00:02:00.870
This one has just seven on it.,00:02:00.870,00:02:03.770
"And the story was at
the beginning of time,",00:02:03.770,00:02:08.030
"God placed the 64 disks on
one of the three golden pegs.",00:02:08.030,00:02:14.390
"And he got an order of
monks whose lifelong mission",00:02:14.390,00:02:18.900
"was to move the disks one
at a time so at the end",00:02:18.900,00:02:22.440
"all 64 disks were lined
up on an adjacent peg.",00:02:22.440,00:02:26.550
"And according to legend,
when that task was done",00:02:26.550,00:02:29.990
"the tower would crumble
and the world would end.",00:02:29.990,00:02:34.540
"Sort of explains
why monks are never",00:02:34.540,00:02:37.520
"smiling, because
they work forever",00:02:37.520,00:02:39.750
"and then just
something bad happens.",00:02:39.750,00:02:42.530
"Now, the question we
want to be able to answer",00:02:42.530,00:02:44.830
"is, how long till
the world ends?",00:02:44.830,00:02:48.220
"So we can start with
a simpler version.",00:02:48.220,00:02:53.300
"Say let's take three
disks and start with that.",00:02:53.300,00:02:58.940
"And let's see, is it doable?",00:02:58.940,00:03:00.890
"Well, we could.",00:03:00.890,00:03:02.660
"That's one, that's two,
three, four, five, six, seven.",00:03:02.660,00:03:16.740
So it's doable with three disks.,00:03:16.740,00:03:18.820
And we took seven moves.,00:03:18.820,00:03:20.180
"Maybe there's a
better way, and that's",00:03:20.180,00:03:22.220
"part of what we'll
try to study today.",00:03:22.220,00:03:25.420
"In fact, what we'd like to know
is how many moves for n disks?",00:03:25.420,00:03:31.512
And is it even finite?,00:03:34.820,00:03:36.470
"So we're going to define t
sub n to be the minimum number",00:03:36.470,00:03:42.330
of moves for n disks.,00:03:42.330,00:03:49.330
"So to take a stack of
n disks and move them",00:03:49.330,00:03:51.880
to an adjacent peg.,00:03:51.880,00:03:54.510
"So, for example, what's t1?",00:03:54.510,00:03:58.010
One.,00:03:58.010,00:03:58.510
"I got one peg, I just move it.",00:03:58.510,00:03:59.860
That's easy.,00:03:59.860,00:04:01.726
"t2, 3.",00:04:01.726,00:04:05.040
"Move the little
guy, move the base,",00:04:05.040,00:04:07.870
move the little guy back on top.,00:04:07.870,00:04:10.000
That's the best you can do.,00:04:10.000,00:04:12.090
"And we've seen that
t3 is at most 7.",00:04:12.090,00:04:16.510
Maybe there's a better way.,00:04:16.510,00:04:19.060
"But let's try to first get
an upper bound on this.",00:04:19.060,00:04:22.930
"Any thoughts about how we
might go about a general upper",00:04:22.930,00:04:26.220
bound for n for this problem?,00:04:26.220,00:04:31.710
Like say I had four disks.,00:04:31.710,00:04:35.270
"Any thoughts about
a strategy where",00:04:35.270,00:04:37.540
"we might be able to
analyze or get an upper",00:04:37.540,00:04:39.510
"bound the number of steps
for four disks here?",00:04:39.510,00:04:43.570
Or more disks.,00:04:43.570,00:04:44.400
Any thoughts?,00:04:44.400,00:04:45.556
Yeah.,00:04:45.556,00:04:46.056
"AUDIENCE: You can look
at the previous problem",00:04:47.999,00:04:51.412
"and then add a certain
number of [INAUDIBLE].",00:04:51.412,00:04:55.890
"TOM LEIGHTON: Look at
the three disk problem.",00:04:55.890,00:04:57.780
That's a good idea.,00:04:57.780,00:04:59.370
"In fact, you know, I could
look at the three disk problem",00:04:59.370,00:05:03.240
recursively.,00:05:03.240,00:05:04.210
I got these three disks.,00:05:04.210,00:05:05.450
"Say I move them over a series
of steps, seven steps at most,",00:05:05.450,00:05:10.160
to put them here.,00:05:10.160,00:05:12.035
What would I do next?,00:05:12.035,00:05:13.282
"Move the lower one and then
do this recurrent problem",00:05:16.240,00:05:20.000
again back.,00:05:20.000,00:05:22.860
"All right, so we can take
a problem with n disks",00:05:22.860,00:05:26.310
and solve it recursively.,00:05:26.310,00:05:29.900
"Let's see what happens
when we do that.",00:05:29.900,00:05:31.698
"So let's look at a
recursive solution.",00:05:35.087,00:05:36.670
And let's draw it for n.,00:05:43.920,00:05:46.000
"So the first phase
that you described",00:05:46.000,00:05:50.220
"is I start, here
are my three pegs,",00:05:50.220,00:05:52.430
"and I start with this,
1, 2, 3 down to end here,",00:05:52.430,00:05:55.900
and nothing on these pegs.,00:05:55.900,00:05:58.170
"And I'm going to use recursion
to take the top and minus 1",00:05:58.170,00:06:02.520
and move them out here.,00:06:02.520,00:06:04.510
So I leave the nth guy there.,00:06:04.510,00:06:06.130
Nothing here.,00:06:06.130,00:06:07.680
"And I go 1, 2, to n minus 1.",00:06:07.680,00:06:12.870
"How many steps does that move
take, that series of moves",00:06:12.870,00:06:17.870
"take, that phase?",00:06:17.870,00:06:20.650
In terms of t.,00:06:20.650,00:06:23.740
"t of n minus 1, because I'm
taking an n minus 1 disk stack",00:06:23.740,00:06:28.020
and moving it.,00:06:28.020,00:06:28.980
So that is tn minus 1 steps.,00:06:28.980,00:06:32.030
"All right, now my next
move is to take this guy",00:06:36.230,00:06:40.600
and stick him here.,00:06:40.600,00:06:41.523
So we'll draw that over here.,00:06:44.120,00:06:46.460
"So the nth guy moves there and
I leave all these guys here.",00:06:46.460,00:06:49.502
That's going to be phase two.,00:06:52.030,00:06:53.460
I move the largest disk.,00:06:57.840,00:06:59.370
"And how many steps
did that take?",00:07:04.120,00:07:07.590
One step.,00:07:07.590,00:07:08.500
Just move one disk.,00:07:08.500,00:07:09.590
One step for that.,00:07:13.430,00:07:14.370
"And then my last phase
is to take all these",00:07:14.370,00:07:18.620
and move them onto here.,00:07:18.620,00:07:19.708
"And so then it looks like
the final result, 1, 2,",00:07:30.240,00:07:34.800
over n minus 1 over n.,00:07:34.800,00:07:36.930
"And how many steps
this phase three take?",00:07:36.930,00:07:39.111
tn minus 1.,00:07:42.200,00:07:43.888
Good.,00:07:43.888,00:07:44.388
"All right, so we've
got an algorithm now,",00:07:47.710,00:07:49.660
a recursive algorithm.,00:07:49.660,00:07:52.080
"And the total time,
the number of moves tn",00:07:52.080,00:08:03.610
"is at most tn minus 1 plus
tn minus 1 is 2tn minus 1",00:08:03.610,00:08:10.820
plus the one step up there.,00:08:10.820,00:08:14.970
"For example, which
we already know,",00:08:14.970,00:08:16.930
"t3 is at most 2t2 plus 1,
which is 2 times 3 plus 1 is 7.",00:08:16.930,00:08:26.070
"So we already knew we
could do it in seven.",00:08:26.070,00:08:28.470
"What's an upper bound on
the time to move four disks?",00:08:28.470,00:08:33.210
15.,00:08:33.210,00:08:34.559
OK?,00:08:34.559,00:08:36.330
"All right, so t4 is at most 15.",00:08:36.330,00:08:41.390
But maybe there's a better way.,00:08:41.390,00:08:43.070
This is just one way to do it.,00:08:43.070,00:08:45.740
"How many people think there's a
better way than this approach?",00:08:45.740,00:08:51.590
"How many people think
there is no better way?",00:08:51.590,00:08:53.770
"All right, very good.",00:08:53.770,00:08:55.250
"Yeah, this is the
best you can do.",00:08:55.250,00:08:57.570
And let's prove that.,00:08:57.570,00:08:58.710
Let's get a lower bound.,00:08:58.710,00:08:59.820
"All right, to see why this is
optimal, think about the step",00:09:07.500,00:09:13.610
where the nth disk moves.,00:09:13.610,00:09:17.010
"At some point in our procedure,
the biggest disk has to move.",00:09:17.010,00:09:23.600
"Now, it could move to
this peg or that peg,",00:09:23.600,00:09:25.670
doesn't really matter.,00:09:25.670,00:09:26.700
"But when it moves,
what do I know",00:09:26.700,00:09:29.835
"had to have happened
before that guy moved?",00:09:29.835,00:09:32.250
"Everything on top of it had
to move to the other peg.",00:09:37.150,00:09:42.360
"I started with 1
through n minus 1 here.",00:09:42.360,00:09:44.840
None of them can be here.,00:09:44.840,00:09:46.410
They all have to be here.,00:09:46.410,00:09:49.680
OK?,00:09:49.680,00:09:50.970
"So that means that I have to
have had tn minus 1 steps.",00:09:50.970,00:09:57.330
"So at least tn minus 1 steps
before the big disk moves.",00:09:57.330,00:10:07.792
All right?,00:10:12.520,00:10:13.560
"Then there is the step
when the big guy moves.",00:10:13.560,00:10:18.850
"One step for the
big guy to move.",00:10:18.850,00:10:20.570
"Because it's got to
move at least once.",00:10:27.954,00:10:29.578
"And then after it moves, I got
to get everything else, one way",00:10:33.490,00:10:39.140
"or another, on top of it.",00:10:39.140,00:10:42.500
"At some point after the
last time the big guy moves,",00:10:42.500,00:10:46.110
"everything else
has to go on top.",00:10:46.110,00:10:48.890
"And that's another
tn minus 1 steps.",00:10:48.890,00:10:51.219
"So after the last time
the big guy moves,",00:10:55.350,00:11:04.160
"you've got to take
tn minus 1 steps.",00:11:04.160,00:11:05.988
"OK, so that means
there's a lower bound",00:11:10.560,00:11:12.640
"that no matter what you do tn
is at least 2tn minus 1 plus 1.",00:11:12.640,00:11:21.420
"And so in fact, it's equal.",00:11:21.420,00:11:24.880
tn equals 2tn minus 1 plus 1.,00:11:24.880,00:11:30.730
"So t3 is 7, t4 is 15.",00:11:30.730,00:11:34.750
Any questions about that?,00:11:34.750,00:11:38.920
"All right, well we'd like to
know how long till the world",00:11:42.080,00:11:44.590
"ends, which is t64.",00:11:44.590,00:11:47.580
"So we'd like to get
a formula for t of n.",00:11:47.580,00:11:50.440
"We could just compute
it 64 times and see.",00:11:50.440,00:11:54.080
"But much nicer just
to get a formula.",00:11:54.080,00:11:56.237
"And that's what we're going
to learn how to do this week",00:11:56.237,00:11:58.570
"is to get formulas,
closed form expressions,",00:11:58.570,00:12:01.570
to solve recurrences.,00:12:01.570,00:12:03.304
"And there's a bunch of
different methods you can use",00:12:03.304,00:12:05.470
"and we're going to
talk about them.",00:12:05.470,00:12:07.380
"The simplest is to guess the
answer and then check it.",00:12:07.380,00:12:12.500
"It's called guess and
verify, also known",00:12:12.500,00:12:16.750
as the substitution method.,00:12:16.750,00:12:18.270
"Now, what's a good
guess for t of n?",00:12:33.140,00:12:36.850
2 to the n minus 1.,00:12:40.070,00:12:41.250
"You got t of 1 is 1, t of 2 is
3, t of 3 is 7, t of 4 is 15.",00:12:41.250,00:12:49.170
"You won't compute too many
before you guess that t of n",00:12:49.170,00:12:57.730
is 2 to the n minus 1.,00:12:57.730,00:12:59.291
"Now, that doesn't
mean it's true.",00:13:02.570,00:13:04.900
"So how are we going
to verify that guess?",00:13:04.900,00:13:08.760
What proof technique?,00:13:08.760,00:13:11.360
Induction.,00:13:11.360,00:13:12.600
It just keeps coming back.,00:13:12.600,00:13:14.060
"You just never finish
with induction.",00:13:14.060,00:13:16.880
"So we're going to verify
this by induction.",00:13:16.880,00:13:21.172
What's our induction hypothesis?,00:13:28.922,00:13:30.255
Any thoughts?,00:13:33.020,00:13:33.638
Right there.,00:13:38.280,00:13:39.190
"p of n is going to be that
tn equals 2 to the n minus 1.",00:13:39.190,00:13:43.670
Very typical.,00:13:43.670,00:13:44.340
"So the predicate is that t
of n is 2 to the n minus 1.",00:13:47.390,00:13:52.670
Base case.,00:13:52.670,00:13:53.260
We'll pick n equals 1.,00:13:57.970,00:14:00.150
"T of 1 is 1 and that
is 2 to the 1 minus 1.",00:14:00.150,00:14:05.260
So the base case works.,00:14:05.260,00:14:06.310
Now we'll do the inductive step.,00:14:09.120,00:14:10.836
We're going to assume p of n.,00:14:16.950,00:14:20.330
"We're going to assume that
tn equals 2 to the n minus 1",00:14:20.330,00:14:24.320
"to prove pn minus 1, which
is tn plus 1 equals 2",00:14:24.320,00:14:30.940
to the n plus 1 minus 1.,00:14:30.940,00:14:33.970
So a very standard induction.,00:14:33.970,00:14:35.960
So let's look at tn plus 1 now.,00:14:35.960,00:14:39.600
tn plus 1 equals 2n plus 1.,00:14:39.600,00:14:45.910
"Yeah, 2tn plus 1.",00:14:45.910,00:14:49.220
Now we plug in here.,00:14:49.220,00:14:51.320
That's just the recurrence.,00:14:51.320,00:14:52.500
"Now we plug in using our
assumption from the induction.",00:14:52.500,00:14:56.490
"This is 2 to the
n minus 1 plus 1.",00:14:56.490,00:15:04.580
Multiply the 2.,00:15:04.580,00:15:05.330
That's 2 to the n plus 1.,00:15:05.330,00:15:07.430
Minus 2 plus 1 is minus 1.,00:15:07.430,00:15:11.730
And so we're done.,00:15:11.730,00:15:14.651
"All right, so we
guessed the answer.",00:15:14.651,00:15:16.150
It was a pretty easy guess.,00:15:16.150,00:15:17.600
"Very simple to prove
it by induction.",00:15:17.600,00:15:21.087
Any questions?,00:15:21.087,00:15:21.670
"All right, how
long would it take",00:15:24.250,00:15:25.850
"me to do all seven disks
on this puzzle here?",00:15:25.850,00:15:31.010
How many steps?,00:15:31.010,00:15:31.795
127 steps.,00:15:35.118,00:15:37.060
"How long till the
end of the world?",00:15:37.060,00:15:40.350
A long time.,00:15:40.350,00:15:41.500
"2 to the 64th minus 1 is
18 billion, billion moves.",00:15:41.500,00:15:46.070
"So going to keep those monks
busy for a little while",00:15:46.070,00:15:50.020
before the world ends.,00:15:50.020,00:15:52.180
"Now in general, this method
is sort of the best method",00:15:52.180,00:15:56.900
for solving a recurrence.,00:15:56.900,00:15:58.620
"We'll see lots of examples
where it works great.",00:15:58.620,00:16:01.950
"The only problem is it
requires that divine insight",00:16:01.950,00:16:04.530
"thing, that guess to
guess the right answer.",00:16:04.530,00:16:06.970
"Obviously if we guess the wrong
answer, it's not going to work.",00:16:06.970,00:16:10.480
"Guessing is many times
easy, but not always.",00:16:10.480,00:16:15.520
"So you need other methods
when you can't guess it.",00:16:15.520,00:16:18.220
"The next most common
method has a lot of names.",00:16:18.220,00:16:21.320
"It's called plug and chug,
expansion, iteration,",00:16:21.320,00:16:26.780
"brute force, exhaustion.",00:16:26.780,00:16:30.572
"Let me show you how that
works in this example.",00:16:30.572,00:16:32.530
"OK, so plug and chug.",00:16:44.640,00:16:46.190
"So we'll solve the
same recurrence.",00:16:51.040,00:16:54.410
"So we've got tn
equals, and I'm going",00:16:54.410,00:16:56.880
"to write it just
reversed, 1 plus 2tn.",00:16:56.880,00:17:01.030
"Because I'm going to expand
out the recurrent term.",00:17:01.030,00:17:04.280
"That's why it's
called expansion also.",00:17:04.280,00:17:08.109
"Well, that's equal to 1 plus 2.",00:17:08.109,00:17:11.150
"Now I expand this out
using the recurrence.",00:17:11.150,00:17:14.230
1 plus 2 tn minus 1.,00:17:14.230,00:17:17.066
"All right, now I do a
little chugging here.",00:17:20.048,00:17:22.250
So I plugged here.,00:17:22.250,00:17:24.700
Now I'll do chug.,00:17:24.700,00:17:27.089
"That's 1 plus 2
plus 4 tn minus 1.",00:17:27.089,00:17:33.420
Now I'm going to plug in again.,00:17:33.420,00:17:34.906
What's that?,00:17:37.580,00:17:38.738
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:17:38.738,00:17:39.654
TOM LEIGHTON: You're right.,00:17:42.700,00:17:45.290
"You're right, I've got to get
minus 1 here and minus 2 here.",00:17:45.290,00:17:49.140
That is correct.,00:17:49.140,00:17:50.310
Very good.,00:17:50.310,00:17:50.810
I would have run into trouble.,00:17:50.810,00:17:52.400
That's good.,00:17:52.400,00:17:53.118
Now I plug in here.,00:17:55.730,00:17:57.350
"1 plus 2 plus 4, 1
plus 2 tn minus 3.",00:17:57.350,00:18:04.680
Then we do the chug.,00:18:04.680,00:18:05.525
"1 plus 2 plus 4
plus 8 tn minus 3.",00:18:19.230,00:18:26.770
"All right, and now we're
going to try to observe",00:18:26.770,00:18:29.270
the pattern we're getting.,00:18:29.270,00:18:30.412
"So there's a little bit of a
guess going on in this context",00:18:30.412,00:18:32.870
still.,00:18:32.870,00:18:33.850
But you see the pattern.,00:18:33.850,00:18:34.850
We've got powers of 2.,00:18:34.850,00:18:36.760
Pretty easy pattern.,00:18:36.760,00:18:37.690
"So you might say if
I keep on doing this,",00:18:37.690,00:18:39.890
"I'm going to get 1
plus 2 plus 4 plus",00:18:39.890,00:18:43.170
"dot dot dot plus 2 to
the i minus 1 plus 2",00:18:43.170,00:18:48.690
to the i tn minus i.,00:18:48.690,00:18:52.964
Got 2 to the 3 tn minus 3 there.,00:18:52.964,00:18:56.930
"And then I take this all the way
down to i equals n minus 1, 1",00:18:56.930,00:19:01.770
"plus 2 plus 4 plus 2
to the n minus 2 plus 2",00:19:01.770,00:19:10.230
to the n minus 1 t1.,00:19:10.230,00:19:12.910
And t1 is just 1.,00:19:15.570,00:19:17.300
"So I'm just getting the
sum of the powers of 2",00:19:21.950,00:19:24.660
up to the n minus 1.,00:19:24.660,00:19:26.810
"And we know what that is
from last time, for sure.",00:19:26.810,00:19:30.180
That's just 2 to the n minus 1.,00:19:30.180,00:19:34.000
"So we've derived the answer
with only a little bit",00:19:34.000,00:19:36.570
"of a-- we had to observe
the pattern here,",00:19:36.570,00:19:38.930
which is often easy to do.,00:19:38.930,00:19:40.310
"But now we've
derived the answer.",00:19:40.310,00:19:42.980
"Now to be really safe,
we've got to go back",00:19:42.980,00:19:45.170
"and still do verify,
just to make sure",00:19:45.170,00:19:47.390
"that we didn't make a mistake in
how we did the derivation here.",00:19:47.390,00:19:53.580
OK?,00:19:53.580,00:19:55.610
"Any questions about
that approach?",00:19:55.610,00:19:59.210
"You just keep plugging it
back into the recurrence,",00:19:59.210,00:20:01.580
"look at the pattern you get, and
try to guess it from that point",00:20:01.580,00:20:05.330
and then solve.,00:20:05.330,00:20:08.040
"All right, let's do a little
more interesting recurrence.",00:20:08.040,00:20:10.916
"This is a fairly famous
one that comes up",00:20:13.690,00:20:15.680
"in a well known algorithm for
sorting called merge sort.",00:20:15.680,00:20:19.780
"This is an algorithm
you'll look at in 6046,",00:20:19.780,00:20:22.890
"one of the many
sorting algorithms",00:20:22.890,00:20:24.380
"you'll study when you
take an algorithms class.",00:20:24.380,00:20:27.290
"So you're given n numbers and
your task is to sort them,",00:20:39.310,00:20:43.740
put them in order.,00:20:43.740,00:20:45.140
"And you're allowed
to do comparisons",00:20:45.140,00:20:46.890
between the numbers.,00:20:46.890,00:20:48.120
"You can think of them as
you've got a list of names,",00:20:48.120,00:20:51.240
"putting them in
alphabetical order.",00:20:51.240,00:20:53.380
"How many comparisons do you
have to do to make that happen?",00:20:53.380,00:20:57.260
"And this is one way to do
it that's very efficient.",00:20:57.260,00:21:01.360
So to sort n items.,00:21:01.360,00:21:05.250
"In fact, we're going to look
at n being a power of 2.",00:21:05.250,00:21:07.910
"Call the items x1, x2, xn.",00:21:07.910,00:21:13.270
"n's going to be a power of
2 to make it simple for now.",00:21:13.270,00:21:17.348
"The first thing
we're going to do",00:21:20.186,00:21:21.560
"is recursively
sort the first half",00:21:21.560,00:21:24.680
"of the items and
the second half.",00:21:24.680,00:21:29.860
"So we use recursion to short
the first n over 2 items",00:21:29.860,00:21:33.960
and the last n over 2 items.,00:21:33.960,00:21:35.640
"And then we're going to
merge those two sorted lists",00:21:46.290,00:21:48.668
together.,00:21:48.668,00:21:49.167
"So we're going to merge
this list and that list.",00:21:52.830,00:21:54.830
"So let's see how this works and
figure out how many comparisons",00:21:54.830,00:21:59.170
we have to do to sort the list.,00:21:59.170,00:22:01.630
"For example, let's say
we're sorting this list.",00:22:09.580,00:22:16.140
"10, 7, 23, 5, 2, 4, 3, and 9.",00:22:16.140,00:22:25.260
"So I've got eight numbers
that I'm going to sort.",00:22:25.260,00:22:29.420
"So the first step is to
recursively sort that list.",00:22:29.420,00:22:35.110
"And when I do that, I produce,
so I'm sorting 10, 7, 23, 5.",00:22:35.110,00:22:44.380
"And that produces, let's see,
I'm going to get 5, 7, 10, 23.",00:22:44.380,00:22:48.725
"And then I recursively
sort these guys.",00:22:55.050,00:22:59.200
"And that produces
2, 3, 4, and 9.",00:22:59.200,00:23:05.430
"I've done comparisons,
but haven't counted them",00:23:08.500,00:23:10.850
"because they're
in the recursion.",00:23:10.850,00:23:12.640
"Now I'm going to use
comparisons to merge the lists,",00:23:12.640,00:23:16.210
"And the way I'm
going to do that is",00:23:16.210,00:23:21.740
"to look at the smallest item
in each list and compare them.",00:23:21.740,00:23:28.150
"Because I know the
smallest item overall",00:23:28.150,00:23:30.150
is either this one or that one.,00:23:30.150,00:23:32.220
"And when I compare 2 to
5, 2's the smaller one,",00:23:32.220,00:23:36.870
so I start with 2.,00:23:36.870,00:23:39.150
And I strike it.,00:23:39.150,00:23:42.520
"What two items do I compare next
to get the next smallest item?",00:23:42.520,00:23:47.360
5 and 3.,00:23:47.360,00:23:48.520
Smallest remaining guys.,00:23:48.520,00:23:49.520
I get 3.,00:23:49.520,00:23:51.110
Scratch that guy.,00:23:51.110,00:23:52.960
And I compare 5 and 4.,00:23:52.960,00:23:55.290
"Get 4, scratch him.",00:23:55.290,00:23:58.310
And 5 and 9.,00:23:58.310,00:24:00.610
5 is the smallest.,00:24:00.610,00:24:02.720
7 and 9.,00:24:02.720,00:24:05.048
7.,00:24:05.048,00:24:05.952
9 and 10.,00:24:05.952,00:24:07.000
"And actually now I
don't really have",00:24:09.700,00:24:11.920
to do any more comparisons.,00:24:11.920,00:24:13.230
All I've got is one list left.,00:24:13.230,00:24:15.360
"So I can just send
these guys down.",00:24:15.360,00:24:18.580
And I produced a sorted list.,00:24:21.330,00:24:22.906
"Now, how many comparisons do
I have to do in the worst case",00:24:27.050,00:24:33.410
"if this is n over 2 items here
and this is n over 2 here?",00:24:33.410,00:24:40.620
"How many comparisons
do I have to do",00:24:40.620,00:24:43.710

have the sub list sorted?,00:24:46.080,00:24:49.260
What is it?,00:24:49.260,00:24:50.860
n.,00:24:50.860,00:24:51.360
Very close.,00:24:51.360,00:24:53.340
"n minus 1 is right,
because every time I",00:24:53.340,00:24:58.260
"do a comparison I pull an
item and stick it in the list.",00:24:58.260,00:25:02.420
"But once I get down
to the very last item,",00:25:02.420,00:25:05.020
"just one guy sitting there, I
don't have to do a comparison.",00:25:05.020,00:25:07.820
It was just the last guy.,00:25:07.820,00:25:08.930
I know he's the largest.,00:25:08.930,00:25:11.060
"So it could go up to n
minus 1 in the worst case.",00:25:11.060,00:25:15.290
"In this situation, I
actually did n minus 2",00:25:15.290,00:25:18.340
"because I was left with
two guys at the end,",00:25:18.340,00:25:20.180
I just bring them down.,00:25:20.180,00:25:21.350
"But it might have been that
the next largest thing to 23",00:25:21.350,00:25:24.480
"was here and then I would
have done n minus 1.",00:25:24.480,00:25:29.660
Any questions?,00:25:29.660,00:25:31.740
Yeah.,00:25:31.740,00:25:32.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:25:32.540,00:25:35.380
Would that make it faster?,00:25:35.380,00:25:37.145
"TOM LEIGHTON: Well,
that's what's going",00:25:37.145,00:25:38.770
to happen with the recursion.,00:25:38.770,00:25:40.872
"Because the first
thing we're going to do",00:25:40.872,00:25:42.580

set up the recursion",00:26:11.230,00:26:12.980
"to count how many
comparisons are",00:26:12.980,00:26:15.510
"needed for the whole thing,
not just the last merge phase.",00:26:15.510,00:26:19.280
"All right, so let's define.",00:26:34.200,00:26:36.225
"And instead of t sub n,
I'm going to write t of n",00:26:39.250,00:26:41.635
as a function.,00:26:41.635,00:26:42.620
"Makes no difference,
but you'll see people",00:26:42.620,00:26:44.420
do recurrences both ways.,00:26:44.420,00:26:46.440
t of n or t sub n.,00:26:46.440,00:26:48.477
"It's going to be the
number of comparisons.",00:26:48.477,00:26:50.268
"Use my merge sort
to sort n numbers.",00:26:56.180,00:27:02.770
"In the worst case, worst case.",00:27:02.770,00:27:04.853
"All right, so we already
know that merging",00:27:07.650,00:27:14.270
"takes n minus 1 comparisons
in the worst case.",00:27:14.270,00:27:23.810
"And you always want to
prepare for the worst case.",00:27:23.810,00:27:26.215
"How many comparisons are
used in the recursive",00:27:29.860,00:27:35.010
"steps to sort this list and
to sort that list, in general.",00:27:35.010,00:27:41.030
"tn over 2 to do
this list times 2.",00:27:41.030,00:27:48.400
"Because you've got two
lists of size n over 2.",00:27:48.400,00:27:50.520
"Two sub problems
besides n over 2.",00:27:50.520,00:27:52.430
Each takes t of n over 2.,00:27:52.430,00:27:55.650
"All right, so you've got
2 tn over 2 comparisons",00:27:55.650,00:28:04.030
for the recursive sorting.,00:28:04.030,00:28:05.852
"That means that t of n equals
2 t of n over 2 plus n minus 1.",00:28:13.010,00:28:24.850
"And we should say
what t of 1 is.",00:28:24.850,00:28:26.960
What's that?,00:28:26.960,00:28:28.808
What's the time to sort?,00:28:28.808,00:28:31.390
0.,00:28:31.390,00:28:31.960
"You don't do any comparisons
if there's one item.",00:28:31.960,00:28:34.430
"So we'll set that
as our base case.",00:28:34.430,00:28:36.016
"All right, so let's
find the answer.",00:28:42.180,00:28:46.710
"So the first thing to always
do when you see a recurrence",00:28:46.710,00:28:49.892
"is to take a few values,
compute a few values,",00:28:49.892,00:28:54.560
and try to guess the answer.,00:28:54.560,00:28:57.560
So what's t of 2?,00:28:57.560,00:28:59.090
1.,00:29:03.020,00:29:03.660
Plug it in.,00:29:03.660,00:29:04.930
"I get 2t of 1, t of
1's 0, plus 2 minus 1.",00:29:04.930,00:29:08.220
That's 1.,00:29:08.220,00:29:08.740
"And we're only doing
powers of 4 here.",00:29:11.530,00:29:13.490
"Sorry, powers of 2.",00:29:13.490,00:29:14.310
So I go to t of 4 next.,00:29:14.310,00:29:15.720
What's t of 4?,00:29:15.720,00:29:16.691
5.,00:29:22.420,00:29:24.280
"Right, because I got double
this is 2 plus 4 minus 1.",00:29:24.280,00:29:28.670
That's adding 3.,00:29:28.670,00:29:30.080
So I get 5.,00:29:30.080,00:29:32.630
"All right, let's look at t of 8.",00:29:32.630,00:29:36.500
That's twice 5 plus 8 minus 1.,00:29:36.500,00:29:43.380
17.,00:29:43.380,00:29:43.880
Not so clear what to guess here.,00:29:48.320,00:29:51.360
We can try one more.,00:29:51.360,00:29:54.370
"T of 16 equals 2 times
17 plus 16 minus 1",00:29:54.370,00:29:59.480
equals 34 and 15 is 49.,00:29:59.480,00:30:07.280
Is that right?,00:30:07.280,00:30:09.450
34 and 15.,00:30:09.450,00:30:10.782
Any guesses?,00:30:13.460,00:30:14.496
You're not going to guess this.,00:30:18.780,00:30:20.729
That's not going to work.,00:30:20.729,00:30:21.770
That happens.,00:30:21.770,00:30:22.994
"And a miracle could happen,
you get a divine insight",00:30:22.994,00:30:25.160
"and guess it, but I
think it's not likely.",00:30:25.160,00:30:28.730
"All right, so let's
go to plug and chug.",00:30:28.730,00:30:33.180
See if that works.,00:30:33.180,00:30:34.104
"All right, so now plug and chug.",00:30:44.370,00:30:46.257
"All right, so we
write down t of n",00:30:51.620,00:30:54.270
"is-- and you always write their
current part last for plug",00:30:54.270,00:30:57.310
and chug to keep it simpler.,00:30:57.310,00:30:59.830
2 t of n over 2.,00:30:59.830,00:31:03.790
"And then I substitute, I
plug in for t of n over 2.",00:31:03.790,00:31:08.310
"So I have n minus 1
plus 2 n over 2 minus 1",00:31:08.310,00:31:14.290
plus 2 t of n over 4.,00:31:14.290,00:31:19.410
Then I chug.,00:31:19.410,00:31:22.010
"So I have n minus 1
plus that's n minus 2.",00:31:22.010,00:31:28.710
Plus 4 tn over 4.,00:31:28.710,00:31:30.861
"All right, then
we'll plug in here.",00:31:33.950,00:31:35.578
"And I get n over 4 minus
1 plus 4 tn over 8.",00:31:41.630,00:31:47.705
And now we chug.,00:31:50.510,00:31:51.365
That's an n here minus a 4.,00:31:57.180,00:32:00.150
I did something wrong.,00:32:03.080,00:32:04.580
That should be 2.,00:32:04.580,00:32:06.670
4 times 2 is 8 tn over 8.,00:32:06.670,00:32:09.652
"All right, can you start to
guess the pattern here maybe?",00:32:12.590,00:32:17.470
"We probably should do
one more to be safe.",00:32:17.470,00:32:19.820
"But you got an n minus 1 plus
an n minus 2 plus an n minus 4.",00:32:19.820,00:32:25.850
"And if we do one more, what's
the next term going to be?",00:32:25.850,00:32:29.820
n minus 8.,00:32:29.820,00:32:31.720
"And this is looking
pretty simple.",00:32:31.720,00:32:33.530
"So we could guess now that
the pattern is n minus 1",00:32:33.530,00:32:39.830
"plus n minus 2 plus
n minus 4 all the way",00:32:39.830,00:32:45.070
"out to plus n minus
2 to the i minus 1",00:32:45.070,00:32:49.290
"plus 2 to the i t
n over 2 to the i.",00:32:49.290,00:32:55.350
"And now we go all
the way down where",00:32:55.350,00:32:57.160
"i equals log n, base
2, and see what we get.",00:32:57.160,00:33:02.480
"1 plus n minus 2 plus all
the way down n minus 2",00:33:05.810,00:33:11.390
"to the log n minus 1 plus
2 to the log n t of 1.",00:33:11.390,00:33:22.270
What's t of 1?,00:33:22.270,00:33:25.070
0.,00:33:25.070,00:33:25.780
That's nice.,00:33:25.780,00:33:26.460
That goes away.,00:33:26.460,00:33:28.680
"All right, so this is
not looking so bad.",00:33:28.680,00:33:31.640
"This equals the sum i equals 0
to log n minus 1 of n minus 2",00:33:31.640,00:33:42.120
to the i.,00:33:42.120,00:33:42.768
"All right, and this
will be good practice",00:33:45.102,00:33:46.810
maybe for towards the test.,00:33:46.810,00:33:49.850
"Well, I can split that sum up.",00:33:49.850,00:33:52.346
"i equals 0 to log n minus 1
of n minus the i equals 0 log",00:33:52.346,00:34:02.160
n minus 1 of 2 to the i.,00:34:02.160,00:34:04.063
"Well, this is easy.",00:34:06.841,00:34:07.940
"I'm just adding n up a
total of log n times.",00:34:07.940,00:34:12.639
So I have n log n.,00:34:12.639,00:34:13.659
"This is just something
the powers of 2",00:34:17.150,00:34:19.050
which we know how to do.,00:34:19.050,00:34:20.460
"So that's going to be
2 to the log n minus 1.",00:34:20.460,00:34:26.659
"And so we get our answer
is n log n minus 2",00:34:26.659,00:34:33.730
"the log n is just n
minus 1 is a plus 1.",00:34:33.730,00:34:39.710
"Well, we derived an answer.",00:34:39.710,00:34:41.072
"Let's just go back and
check some of the values.",00:34:43.670,00:34:47.060
n equals 1.,00:34:47.060,00:34:48.870
That's 0 and I get 1 minus 1.,00:34:48.870,00:34:50.850
It works.,00:34:50.850,00:34:52.630
n equals 2.,00:34:52.630,00:34:55.159
2 log 2 is 2 minus 2 plus 1.,00:34:55.159,00:35:00.040
Works.,00:35:00.040,00:35:01.360
"Plug in 4, I get 4 log 4 is
8 minus 4 is 4 plus 1 is 5.",00:35:01.360,00:35:07.900
So it works for those examples.,00:35:07.900,00:35:10.060
"Now, to be really careful we
should prove it by induction.",00:35:10.060,00:35:14.690
"Because when you do
enough of these equations,",00:35:14.690,00:35:17.170
"you make mistakes like I
invariably do even up here.",00:35:17.170,00:35:19.920
"And even though it's
written down here,",00:35:19.920,00:35:21.590
"I'll make mistakes
writing it on the board.",00:35:21.590,00:35:23.840
"And so you want to
check by induction.",00:35:23.840,00:35:26.245
"OK, so this is the answer.",00:35:30.310,00:35:31.880
"This is how many comparisons
are done in merge sort.",00:35:31.880,00:35:36.600
"And the nice thing is this
is growing nearly linearly.",00:35:36.600,00:35:40.550
It grows as n log n.,00:35:40.550,00:35:41.810
"And that's why this algorithm
is used a lot in practice.",00:35:41.810,00:35:44.510
"Much better than
comparing every item",00:35:44.510,00:35:46.330
"to every other item, which would
be more like n squared steps.",00:35:46.330,00:35:50.000
"So much better than a
naive sorting algorithm.",00:35:50.000,00:35:54.270
"Any questions about
what we did there?",00:35:54.270,00:35:59.060
"Just one rule of thumb when
you're doing the plug and chug.",00:35:59.060,00:36:05.240
"Notice that I didn't try to
collapse terms along the way.",00:36:05.240,00:36:10.870
"It makes it easier sometimes
to see the pattern.",00:36:10.870,00:36:13.470
"I left it as n minus 1 plus n
minus 2 and then plus n minus 4",00:36:13.470,00:36:17.570
"rather than saying,
oh, this is 3 n",00:36:17.570,00:36:19.350
"minus 7, which might have made
it harder to guess the pattern.",00:36:19.350,00:36:23.560
"So you don't always, when you're
doing the chugging, collapse",00:36:23.560,00:36:26.130
everything down.,00:36:26.130,00:36:26.810
"You want to try and
see if there are some.",00:36:26.810,00:36:28.440
"Because this is the amount
of work done at each step,",00:36:28.440,00:36:30.050
"and you want to see if you
can see a pattern in that.",00:36:30.050,00:36:32.258
"All right, so let's write
down our two recurrences",00:36:37.070,00:36:39.250
and sort of compare them.,00:36:39.250,00:36:42.090
"So first we did Towers of
Hanoi, which was t of n",00:36:52.870,00:36:57.000
equals 2 t of n minus 1 plus 1.,00:36:57.000,00:37:02.380
"And the answer was t of
n is tilde 2 to the n.",00:37:02.380,00:37:08.455
"It was actually 2
to the n minus 1.",00:37:08.455,00:37:11.680
"Then we did merge sort, which is
t of n equals 2 t of n over 2.",00:37:11.680,00:37:19.760
Difference there.,00:37:19.760,00:37:21.240
Plus n minus 1.,00:37:21.240,00:37:23.990
And now the answer was t of n.,00:37:23.990,00:37:26.970
What's the tilde for this one?,00:37:26.970,00:37:29.540
For merge sort.,00:37:29.540,00:37:32.600
n log n.,00:37:32.600,00:37:33.600
"Yeah, I can forget the rest
if I know the tilde, n log n.",00:37:33.600,00:37:36.433
Wow.,00:37:40.140,00:37:42.360
"These are pretty
different answers, right?",00:37:42.360,00:37:45.290
"This one's nearly linear,
that one's exponential.",00:37:45.290,00:37:48.170
"The recurrences
looks pretty similar,",00:37:50.810,00:37:54.320
"in fact, this one
sort of looks worse",00:37:54.320,00:37:55.970
"because I'm adding in n minus
1 every time instead of 1.",00:37:55.970,00:38:00.960
"But the answer's a lot
better, a lot smaller.",00:38:00.960,00:38:05.060
"What's the critical difference
between these recurrences?",00:38:05.060,00:38:09.030
Yeah?,00:38:09.030,00:38:09.530
"AUDIENCE: You're dropping the
argument of t a lot faster.",00:38:12.440,00:38:17.201
"You're cutting it
in half every time",00:38:17.201,00:38:18.700
instead of subtracting one.,00:38:18.700,00:38:19.990
TOM LEIGHTON: Right.,00:38:19.990,00:38:21.010
"AUDIENCE: So it's going
to go away faster.",00:38:21.010,00:38:22.430
TOM LEIGHTON: That's right.,00:38:22.430,00:38:23.555
"Here I've got two
problems of size one less.",00:38:23.555,00:38:26.560
"Here I've got two
problems of half a size.",00:38:26.560,00:38:30.230
"And that makes an enormous
difference in the answer.",00:38:30.230,00:38:33.450
"Even though I'm
doing more work after",00:38:33.450,00:38:36.450
"did the recursive problems,
much faster running",00:38:36.450,00:38:39.700
"time or answer if these are
algorithms that I'm analyzing.",00:38:39.700,00:38:45.540
All right?,00:38:45.540,00:38:47.520
"In fact, let's
take a look at what",00:38:47.520,00:38:50.330
"happens if I didn't use that n
minus 1, I just put a 1 there.",00:38:50.330,00:38:55.050
"Let's see what impact
that n minus 1 had.",00:38:55.050,00:38:59.590
"So let's do the
following recurrence.",00:38:59.590,00:39:05.080
"This one is going to be a little
bit different because I'm not",00:39:05.080,00:39:09.640
going to stick to powers of 2.,00:39:09.640,00:39:10.900
"I'm going to get a little
messier, because that often",00:39:10.900,00:39:13.130
happens in reality.,00:39:13.130,00:39:15.130
"And I'm going to
define s of 1 is 0.",00:39:15.130,00:39:20.690
"s of n is s of the floor
function of n over 2",00:39:20.690,00:39:29.600
"plus s of the ceiling
function of n over 2 plus 1.",00:39:29.600,00:39:35.540
"Now, the ceiling function
means the smallest integer",00:39:40.120,00:39:45.460
that's at least that big.,00:39:45.460,00:39:46.947
"So you're sort of rounding
up to the next integer.",00:39:46.947,00:39:49.030
"And the floor function
means you're rounding down",00:40:00.260,00:40:02.850
to the next integer.,00:40:02.850,00:40:04.430
"So it's the biggest integer
less than equal to n over 2.",00:40:04.430,00:40:13.190
All right.,00:40:13.190,00:40:14.010
"Now, if we had just
powers of 2, this",00:40:14.010,00:40:17.480
would be much easier to write.,00:40:17.480,00:40:19.380
"It would just be sn
equals 2 sn over 2 plus 1.",00:40:19.380,00:40:24.985
"So it's analogous to what we're
doing up there where we're just",00:40:24.985,00:40:27.610
adding 1 instead of n minus 1.,00:40:27.610,00:40:29.746
But I'm being careful. now.,00:40:29.746,00:40:30.870
"I'm going to make
this recurrence",00:40:30.870,00:40:32.245
work for all natural numbers.,00:40:32.245,00:40:35.561
"Because sometimes
in reality, you're",00:40:35.561,00:40:37.060
dealing with non powers of 2.,00:40:37.060,00:40:39.250
"All right, let's see
if we can solve this.",00:40:43.440,00:40:47.580
"What's the first thing
to try to solve this?",00:40:47.580,00:40:50.170
What do you do?,00:40:50.170,00:40:50.890
"What's the first step
when you get a recurrence?",00:40:56.520,00:40:59.060
You try to solve.,00:40:59.060,00:41:00.142
What method should you try?,00:41:03.300,00:41:06.420
Guess.,00:41:06.420,00:41:07.470
"And to guess, well, you
got to plug some values in.",00:41:07.470,00:41:10.840
It's sort of hard to guess.,00:41:10.840,00:41:12.720
"I mean, looking at that, I guess
nothing comes to mind other",00:41:12.720,00:41:15.940
than panic looking at that.,00:41:15.940,00:41:18.820
"But if we plug in some values,
then maybe it won't be so bad.",00:41:18.820,00:41:21.470
So we've got s1 equals 0.,00:41:21.470,00:41:25.200
What's s2?,00:41:25.200,00:41:26.026
"It's not 3, because this is 2
over 2 is 1, floor of 1 is 1.",00:41:34.040,00:41:39.380
s of 1 is 0.,00:41:39.380,00:41:42.590
"Ceiling of 1 is 1
because it's an integer.",00:41:42.590,00:41:45.460
s of 1 is 0 plus 1.,00:41:45.460,00:41:48.630
So s of 2 is 1.,00:41:48.630,00:41:51.400
What's s of 3?,00:41:51.400,00:41:53.530
"Yikes, all right.",00:41:53.530,00:41:55.510
3 over 2 is 1 and 1/2.,00:41:55.510,00:41:57.510
What's the floor of 1 and 1/2?,00:41:57.510,00:41:59.890
1.,00:41:59.890,00:42:00.460
s of 1 is 0.,00:42:00.460,00:42:01.360
That's gone.,00:42:01.360,00:42:02.530
What's the ceiling of 1 and 1/2?,00:42:02.530,00:42:05.090
2.,00:42:05.090,00:42:05.780
s of 2 is 1 plus 1.,00:42:05.780,00:42:09.470
What's the answer for s of 3?,00:42:09.470,00:42:10.800
"2, because I've got 0, 1, and 1.",00:42:14.070,00:42:20.120
s of 4.,00:42:20.120,00:42:21.710
"This one's easy
because it's even.",00:42:21.710,00:42:25.540
"I get s of 2, which is 1 plus
s of two which is 1 plus 1.",00:42:25.540,00:42:31.500
So what's s of 4?,00:42:31.500,00:42:33.500
3.,00:42:33.500,00:42:36.040
You might try a guess.,00:42:36.040,00:42:38.880
What would you guess?,00:42:38.880,00:42:42.010
"Yeah, n minus 1.",00:42:42.010,00:42:43.860
"So we're going to guess
s of n equals n minus 1.",00:42:43.860,00:42:51.297
"And that's not so bad, actually.",00:42:51.297,00:42:52.630
It's pretty simple.,00:42:52.630,00:42:53.421
"Looking at that mess, you'd
never think of that right away.",00:42:53.421,00:42:56.900
"But once you plug in some
values it's not so bad.",00:42:56.900,00:43:00.250
"All right, let's verify it.",00:43:00.250,00:43:02.012
"And we're going to verify
by strong induction.",00:43:05.270,00:43:07.261
"The induction
hypothesis is our guess.",00:43:14.790,00:43:16.720
The base case is easy.,00:43:26.704,00:43:28.560
Because I've got s of 1 is 0.,00:43:31.870,00:43:36.820
And that equals 1 minus 1.,00:43:36.820,00:43:40.160
So that's good.,00:43:40.160,00:43:41.970
So let's do the induction step.,00:43:41.970,00:43:44.124
"All right, so the
induction step.",00:44:00.530,00:44:02.340
"We're going to assume that
p1 is true, p2 is true,",00:44:07.690,00:44:15.850
"all the way up to pn, to
prove pn plus 1 is true.",00:44:15.850,00:44:24.128
For n better than or equal to 1.,00:44:26.820,00:44:28.690
"And then we look at
the n plus first term.",00:44:28.690,00:44:32.880
"That equals s of floor n plus
1 over 2 plus s of ceiling n",00:44:32.880,00:44:41.990
plus 1 over 2 plus 1.,00:44:41.990,00:44:47.710
"All right, now I don't know what
these are exactly depending on",00:44:47.710,00:44:52.470
whether n is even a rod.,00:44:52.470,00:44:55.820
"First let me plug in using
the induction hypothesis.",00:44:55.820,00:45:00.070
"I know that this is n
plus 1 over 2 minus 1.",00:45:00.070,00:45:06.040
"This is ceiling n
plus 1 over 2 minus 1.",00:45:06.040,00:45:11.850
"And then I carry
the plus 1 down.",00:45:11.850,00:45:13.400
"That's by the
induction hypothesis.",00:45:13.400,00:45:15.350
"All right, now I don't
know exactly what",00:45:20.760,00:45:23.600
"either of these values is
unless I know the parity of n.",00:45:23.600,00:45:26.640
"But I do know the sum
of these two things.",00:45:26.640,00:45:30.680
"The floor of something plus
the ceiling of that something",00:45:30.680,00:45:34.150
is twice the something.,00:45:34.150,00:45:37.600
"All right, so this plus
that equals n plus 1.",00:45:37.600,00:45:42.940
"Minus 1 minus 1
plus 1 is minus 1.",00:45:42.940,00:45:46.740
"And so in fact, we
prove that s of n plus 1",00:45:46.740,00:45:49.670
equals n plus 1 minus 1.,00:45:49.670,00:45:54.040
"So we verified the
induction hypothesis.",00:45:54.040,00:45:58.680
Yeah?,00:45:58.680,00:45:59.591
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:45:59.591,00:46:00.507
Taking the n [INAUDIBLE].,00:46:08.040,00:46:09.150
"TOM LEIGHTON: Let's
see, I'm not sure.",00:46:11.877,00:46:13.460
"So are you asking why I
started sn plus 1 here?",00:46:13.460,00:46:18.282
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:46:18.282,00:46:19.198
TOM LEIGHTON: Doesn't matter.,00:46:27.332,00:46:28.540
"But the expression
is s of whatever",00:46:28.540,00:46:33.140
"this is, the induction
hypothesis would be,",00:46:33.140,00:46:36.380
"s of whatever's inside there
is what's inside there minus 1.",00:46:36.380,00:46:40.240
"And so the induction hypothesis
says s of this is that minus 1.",00:46:40.240,00:46:45.178
Any other questions?,00:46:48.437,00:46:49.270
"So let's write that
on our table up here.",00:46:55.260,00:46:57.086
"So this is sn equals
s of floor n over 2",00:47:01.950,00:47:07.980
"plus s of ceiling
n over 2 plus 1.",00:47:07.980,00:47:13.926
"And the answer is, sn is tilde.",00:47:13.926,00:47:19.020
What's the tilde of?,00:47:19.020,00:47:20.010
n.,00:47:23.140,00:47:23.680
The answer is n minus 1.,00:47:23.680,00:47:24.680
So it's tilde of n.,00:47:24.680,00:47:27.850
"Now, this is the same expression
is this if n's a power of 2.",00:47:27.850,00:47:32.310
"I'd have 2 sn over 2 plus
1 instead of n minus 1.",00:47:32.310,00:47:37.440
"And by going from n minus 1 to
1, I got rid of the log term.",00:47:37.440,00:47:44.450
But it's still not exponential.,00:47:44.450,00:47:48.040
"And that's because I'm
cutting down the insides",00:47:48.040,00:47:50.370
here by a factor of 2 roughly.,00:47:50.370,00:47:53.388
"All right, so all the
recurrences we've seen so far",00:47:59.260,00:48:03.300
have been pretty simple.,00:48:03.300,00:48:05.540
"If guess and verify doesn't
work after seeing a few terms,",00:48:05.540,00:48:08.330
"you can use plug and chug
and you can figure it out.",00:48:08.330,00:48:11.750
"The good news is, that
happens a lot in practice.",00:48:11.750,00:48:15.640
"The bad news is, sometimes
it doesn't and you",00:48:15.640,00:48:18.300
can get nasty recurrences.,00:48:18.300,00:48:19.630
"So let me show you a nasty
one that actually was once",00:48:19.630,00:48:27.250
"asked in 6046, I think, on a
quiz with disastrous results.",00:48:27.250,00:48:37.417
"All right, so this one is t
of x equals 2 t of x over 2",00:48:46.340,00:48:57.960
"plus 8/9 t of 3x
over 4 plus x squared",00:48:57.960,00:49:08.260
"for x bigger and equal
to 1, and otherwise it's",00:49:08.260,00:49:11.720
0 when x is less than 1.,00:49:11.720,00:49:14.410
"Now, this is nasty
for a lot of reasons.",00:49:18.230,00:49:21.890
"First, it's not just a
find on the integers.",00:49:21.890,00:49:25.610
"We can make an integer version
by putting floors or ceilings",00:49:25.610,00:49:28.690
here.,00:49:28.690,00:49:29.500
"But the way you set it up now,
it's defined on real numbers.",00:49:29.500,00:49:32.730
"You can, in theory, solve
it with plug and chug.",00:49:36.650,00:49:41.150
"The nasty part is, you've got
a bunch of things going down",00:49:41.150,00:49:44.520
"by powers of 2 and a bunch of
things going down by 3/4 here.",00:49:44.520,00:49:49.410
"And so you have to keep
track of all the terms",00:49:49.410,00:49:51.400
"that are decreasing, and that's
a nightmare plug and chug.",00:49:51.400,00:49:54.179
"Because it's not just one
thing that's unfolding,",00:49:54.179,00:49:56.220
"it's two things
that are unfolding.",00:49:56.220,00:49:58.890
So very painful.,00:49:58.890,00:50:01.280
"Now, it used to be that
was the state of life.",00:50:01.280,00:50:05.390

teaching this course sometime",00:50:05.390,00:50:09.080
"around then, there
just was nothing else",00:50:09.080,00:50:11.700
"to say other than life's
tough and sometimes you've",00:50:11.700,00:50:14.870
"got to do these things
and it's a pain.",00:50:14.870,00:50:18.030
Just had to make the best of it.,00:50:18.030,00:50:20.140
"And then in the mid-90s,
one day two students",00:50:20.140,00:50:24.730
"at the American University
in Beirut came by my office.",00:50:24.730,00:50:28.900

my office and they",00:50:39.139,00:50:40.680

add a 5 t of x over 7.",00:50:46.460,00:50:51.590

just will always work.",00:50:52.580,00:50:56.490
"And the general form
that they claim to solve",00:50:56.490,00:51:00.100
was the following.,00:51:00.100,00:51:02.020
"It's the general class of
divide and conquer recurrences.",00:51:02.020,00:51:06.490

get from an algorithm",00:51:06.490,00:51:08.460

pieces by a constant factor,",00:51:08.460,00:51:12.130
they claim to solve.,00:51:12.130,00:51:14.390
So let me define this class.,00:51:14.390,00:51:16.810
It's a little painful.,00:51:16.810,00:51:18.290
"So a divide and conquer
recurrence has the form.",00:51:28.330,00:51:34.268
"There's a simple version
and the hard version.",00:51:38.450,00:51:41.290
"The simple version is
it looks like that.",00:51:41.290,00:51:45.080
You got a bunch of terms.,00:51:45.080,00:51:47.210
"Inside each term, you cut
it down by a constant factor",00:51:47.210,00:51:50.460
"and then you add
something at the end.",00:51:50.460,00:51:52.290
"That's the simple version
of what a divide and conquer",00:51:52.290,00:51:55.020
recurrence is.,00:51:55.020,00:51:56.130
"And you can throw in floors and
ceilings and other junk too.",00:51:56.130,00:51:59.856
"Now I'm going to give
you the formal version.",00:51:59.856,00:52:01.730

like floors and ceilings",00:52:17.080,00:52:20.170
and who knows what else.,00:52:20.170,00:52:22.170
And then you get more of these.,00:52:22.170,00:52:23.630
"You get a2, t of b2x plus
epsilon 2x and so forth.",00:52:23.630,00:52:33.450

any number of these",00:52:33.450,00:52:34.950
you want up to a constant.,00:52:34.950,00:52:37.120

b sub kx plus epsilon kx.",00:52:37.120,00:52:43.285
"Plus some function of x sitting
out here, like the x squared.",00:52:45.860,00:52:51.330

bigger than some fixed value,",00:52:51.330,00:52:55.520
some constant.,00:52:55.520,00:52:57.690

k is fixed.,00:53:19.740,00:53:21.660

functions can't be too big.",00:53:25.720,00:53:29.990

can't let them be too big",00:53:34.390,00:53:37.100

down by a constant factor.",00:53:37.100,00:53:42.390

too hung up over this",00:53:42.390,00:53:44.260

too deep in the details.",00:53:44.260,00:53:48.030

that's expressed",00:54:03.720,00:54:05.510

g of x is less than x",00:54:05.510,00:54:11.720
to the c for some constant c.,00:54:11.720,00:54:13.820
That's it.,00:54:18.450,00:54:19.020
So this is a mouthful.,00:54:19.020,00:54:20.900
"But like I said before,
anything that looks",00:54:20.900,00:54:23.560
"like that, basically.",00:54:23.560,00:54:26.520
"As long as you don't
throw in exponentials",00:54:26.520,00:54:28.270
"or do something too
wild to it, it works.",00:54:28.270,00:54:32.370
"So let's see which of our
guys over here are divide",00:54:32.370,00:54:36.790
and conquer recurrences.,00:54:36.790,00:54:37.790
How about this one?,00:54:43.390,00:54:44.210
"Towers of Hanoi, is that a
divide and conquer recurrence?",00:54:44.210,00:54:49.300
"Some yes, some no.",00:54:49.300,00:54:52.350
"Who thinks no can
tell me why it's not?",00:54:52.350,00:54:54.540
Why isn't that?,00:54:54.540,00:54:55.479
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:54:55.479,00:54:56.395
TOM LEIGHTON: That's right.,00:54:58.936,00:55:00.060
"The recurrence
problem is n minus 1",00:55:00.060,00:55:03.290
"and we've got to make it down
by a constant factor here.",00:55:03.290,00:55:07.300
The b1 is less than 1.,00:55:07.300,00:55:09.080
It can't be equal to 1.,00:55:09.080,00:55:10.820
"And this is not big enough
to make up for the x over 2",00:55:10.820,00:55:14.330
term or something we're missing.,00:55:14.330,00:55:16.600
"So whenever you have an
n minus 1 and minus 2,",00:55:16.600,00:55:19.690
that is not divide and conquer.,00:55:19.690,00:55:22.690
"We'll discuss those
next time, on Thursday,",00:55:22.690,00:55:24.860
how to solve those.,00:55:24.860,00:55:26.510
"So that's not
divide and conquer.",00:55:26.510,00:55:29.957
What about this one?,00:55:29.957,00:55:30.790
Is that divide and conquer here?,00:55:30.790,00:55:32.180
Yes.,00:55:35.480,00:55:36.710
"You've got two problems
of half the size",00:55:36.710,00:55:39.750
"and you're adding
a linear function.",00:55:39.750,00:55:42.060
It's not exponential.,00:55:42.060,00:55:43.310
It's polynomial.,00:55:43.310,00:55:45.130
That is divide and conquer.,00:55:45.130,00:55:47.710
What about this nasty guy?,00:55:47.710,00:55:50.822
Is that divide and conquer?,00:55:50.822,00:55:51.946
Yeah.,00:55:54.700,00:55:55.940
"You've got basically
n over 2 here.",00:55:55.940,00:55:58.400
Two n over 2 terms now.,00:55:58.400,00:56:00.320
"This is where that epsilon
thing comes in handy.",00:56:00.320,00:56:03.200
"Because epsilon 1
of n, in this case,",00:56:03.200,00:56:05.600
"is floor n over
2 minus n over 2.",00:56:05.600,00:56:13.020
"And that's, at most, 1.",00:56:13.020,00:56:14.876
"So maybe we're adding a half
here or something like that.",00:56:18.180,00:56:21.570
"And we're allowed
to add anything up",00:56:21.570,00:56:23.070
"to n over log
squared of n to fit.",00:56:23.070,00:56:27.240
"So you can mess around with
the low order terms in here.",00:56:27.240,00:56:30.580
And adding 1 is fine as well.,00:56:30.580,00:56:33.560
So that qualifies.,00:56:33.560,00:56:34.432
"Let's check that
this thing qualifies.",00:56:37.670,00:56:40.830
Let's check that.,00:56:40.830,00:56:41.866
"Well, yeah.",00:56:50.570,00:56:51.280
I got 2 constant a1 t of 1/2 x.,00:56:51.280,00:56:57.840
That's OK.,00:56:57.840,00:56:59.050
8/9 t of 3/4 x.,00:56:59.050,00:57:01.450
That's OK.,00:57:01.450,00:57:02.850
My g function is a polynomial.,00:57:02.850,00:57:04.690
The derivative is 2x.,00:57:04.690,00:57:06.020
"That's less than x to a
power or of x to a power.",00:57:06.020,00:57:09.800
So this fits.,00:57:09.800,00:57:10.455
"Any questions about
the definition",00:57:14.430,00:57:16.860
"of a divide and
conquer recurrence?",00:57:16.860,00:57:18.486
"And you can see why
sort of they come up,",00:57:23.722,00:57:25.430
"because whenever you're solving
a problem with recursive pieces",00:57:25.430,00:57:28.800
"that are a constant
factor smaller,",00:57:28.800,00:57:30.780
"you're going to have something
that looks like that.",00:57:30.780,00:57:34.140
"OK, so getting back
to Akra and Bazzi.",00:57:34.140,00:57:36.100
B They show up in my office.,00:57:36.100,00:57:38.580
"They claim to have solved
anything like this.",00:57:38.580,00:57:41.050
"Now needless to say,
I'm a little skeptical.",00:57:41.050,00:57:44.817
"I got to tell you, you're a
professor at MIT, especially",00:57:44.817,00:57:47.150
"mathematics, and
people are always",00:57:47.150,00:57:49.790
"coming by with proofs of
the Riemann hypothesis,",00:57:49.790,00:57:54.020
"p equals np, p doesn't equal np.",00:57:54.020,00:57:57.210
And this was a classic problem.,00:57:57.210,00:58:00.020
"Hundreds of
researchers had studied",00:58:00.020,00:58:01.960
recurrences for decades.,00:58:01.960,00:58:04.960
"And not only, it
wasn't even believed",00:58:04.960,00:58:06.670
"that there was
possibly a solution.",00:58:06.670,00:58:08.792
"It's not like it's one of these
open questions where we all",00:58:08.792,00:58:11.250
"believe p doesn't
equal np and it's just",00:58:11.250,00:58:13.300
a matter of proving it.,00:58:13.300,00:58:14.930
"People didn't think a solution
existed that would be clean.",00:58:14.930,00:58:18.770
"I mean, look at just
the definition's a mess.",00:58:18.770,00:58:20.970
"And how could there possibly
be a clean solution to that?",00:58:20.970,00:58:25.060
"So it's sort of
like the holy grail.",00:58:25.060,00:58:28.020
"It doesn't exist, but
it's fun to think about,",00:58:28.020,00:58:29.940
"that fantasy, maybe there's a
solution and you could find it.",00:58:29.940,00:58:35.370
"And much less, these aren't
reputable researchers",00:58:35.370,00:58:38.380
in my office.,00:58:38.380,00:58:38.980
"These are two
students from Beirut",00:58:38.980,00:58:41.860
"named Akra and Bazzi
claiming they've figured out",00:58:41.860,00:58:44.740
"this thing that all these
professors been teaching",00:58:44.740,00:58:47.030
"this stuff in 6046 for
years said you've got to do",00:58:47.030,00:58:50.830
plug and chug.,00:58:50.830,00:58:53.350
"Anyway, they'd been kicked out
of everybody else's office,",00:58:53.350,00:58:56.420
"so I said, OK, let's do it.",00:58:56.420,00:58:58.320
Show me the solution.,00:58:58.320,00:59:00.650
And they did.,00:59:00.650,00:59:01.930
"And I go, holy cow.",00:59:01.930,00:59:04.280
It's right.,00:59:04.280,00:59:05.297
It looks good.,00:59:05.297,00:59:05.880
"Now, they had a
few details wrong,",00:59:05.880,00:59:07.296
"but my goodness, the
answer was correct",00:59:07.296,00:59:09.560
and it's amazingly simple.,00:59:09.560,00:59:12.680
So now we teach it.,00:59:12.680,00:59:15.260
"And in fact, you can
write the solution",00:59:15.260,00:59:18.610
"down easier than you can
write the definition of divide",00:59:18.610,00:59:21.800
and conquer recurrence.,00:59:21.800,00:59:24.870
Really remarkable.,00:59:24.870,00:59:25.790
"So the theorem by
Akra and Bazzi in '96.",00:59:28.870,00:59:39.950
"Set p, real number, So that
the sum i equals 1 to k",00:59:44.290,00:59:55.240
"of ai times bi to
the p equals 1.",00:59:55.240,01:00:00.720
"So the ai's are
these things here.",01:00:00.720,01:00:04.160
The bi's are the fractions here.,01:00:04.160,01:00:07.720
"All right, find a p
such that this sum is 1.",01:00:07.720,01:00:13.540
Then the answer is this.,01:00:13.540,01:00:16.920
Then t of x equals theta.,01:00:16.920,01:00:21.740
"We're going to use our
asymptotic notation.",01:00:21.740,01:00:24.030
"x to the p plus x to
the p times the integral",01:00:24.030,01:00:29.180
from 1 to x g of u.,01:00:29.180,01:00:33.060
"G is that polynomial thing,
that thing at the end.",01:00:33.060,01:00:37.070
Over u to the p minus 1 du.,01:00:37.070,01:00:40.020
That's it.,01:00:43.050,01:00:45.460
"This is really great
news for you guys,",01:00:45.460,01:00:47.910
"especially if you
go on to algorithms,",01:00:47.910,01:00:49.940
"because you don't
have to deal with plug",01:00:49.940,01:00:51.606
and chug on nasty things.,01:00:51.606,01:00:53.460
You just solve the answer.,01:00:53.460,01:00:55.896
"Now, the proof is
by guess and verify.",01:00:58.790,01:01:03.300
"And they made a
really good guess.",01:01:03.300,01:01:04.875
"You wouldn't think of
looking at that, oh,",01:01:07.510,01:01:09.951
I'm going to guess this.,01:01:09.951,01:01:10.950
Probably not.,01:01:10.950,01:01:13.070
"And there's no real numbers
to try to guess this.",01:01:13.070,01:01:16.310
It's asymptotic notation.,01:01:16.310,01:01:18.850
But it works.,01:01:18.850,01:01:19.860
You can verify it by induction.,01:01:19.860,01:01:21.640
"It's a little painful
to verify by induction,",01:01:21.640,01:01:23.920
but you can do it.,01:01:23.920,01:01:24.880
We won't do it in class.,01:01:24.880,01:01:26.580
"I did try one year,
and it was a disaster,",01:01:26.580,01:01:28.660
"so we don't do it
in class anymore.",01:01:28.660,01:01:31.400
"But let's see some examples
of how to apply this.",01:01:31.400,01:01:33.990
"So let's start with merge sort,
which is the second one here.",01:01:36.750,01:01:42.481
Let's do that.,01:01:42.481,01:01:43.064
"All right, so you
got an example here.",01:01:53.190,01:01:56.390
"t of x equals 2 t of x over 2
plus n minus 1, or x minus 1, x",01:01:56.390,01:02:06.760
now.,01:02:06.760,01:02:07.860
"And I'm not even going to worry
about powers of 2 anymore.",01:02:07.860,01:02:10.630
I don't care.,01:02:10.630,01:02:11.210
It's going to be fine.,01:02:11.210,01:02:14.210
"All right, what
is p in this case?",01:02:14.210,01:02:17.670
I've only got one term.,01:02:17.670,01:02:18.780
"I don't even need a sum from
that definition over there.",01:02:18.780,01:02:22.260
"What's the value
of p for this guy?",01:02:22.260,01:02:27.400
So I've got a1 is 2.,01:02:27.400,01:02:30.760
b1 is 1/2.,01:02:30.760,01:02:33.280
Just one term.,01:02:33.280,01:02:34.202
"What's the value of p such that
2 times 1/2 to the p equals 1?",01:02:37.320,01:02:42.900
1.,01:02:42.900,01:02:43.410
Doesn't get much simpler.,01:02:43.410,01:02:46.020
"So 2 times 1/2 to the p
equals 1 implies p is 1.",01:02:46.020,01:02:53.460
"All right, now I just plug
into the integral over there.",01:02:53.460,01:02:57.370
"All right, let's do that.",01:02:57.370,01:02:58.476
So t of x equals theta.,01:03:12.370,01:03:17.210
"Well, x to the p is x to
the 1 plus just take off",01:03:17.210,01:03:20.620
"the 1, plus x times
the integral 1 to x.",01:03:20.620,01:03:24.960
What's the g function?,01:03:24.960,01:03:29.220
What's g of x in this case?,01:03:29.220,01:03:31.020
x minus 1.,01:03:34.000,01:03:35.950
"So I take the integral of
g of u is just u minus 1",01:03:35.950,01:03:42.730
"over u to the p
plus 1 p minus 1.",01:03:42.730,01:03:53.770
Did I write the formula right?,01:03:53.770,01:03:56.310
Is it plus 1 or minus 1 here?,01:03:56.310,01:04:00.840
Did I get it?,01:04:00.840,01:04:01.640
p plus 1.,01:04:01.640,01:04:02.520
"Sorry, didn't write that right.",01:04:02.520,01:04:04.970
p plus 1 over here.,01:04:04.970,01:04:07.136
"All right, so u to the p
plus 1 is u squared du.",01:04:10.670,01:04:14.860
"This is theta of x plus x
integral 1 over u minus 1",01:04:18.410,01:04:27.580
over u squared.,01:04:27.580,01:04:28.340
"The integral of 1 over
u is the log of u.",01:04:40.650,01:04:42.970
"The integral of 1 over
u squared is 1 over u,",01:04:45.500,01:04:50.640
but I changed the sign there.,01:04:50.640,01:04:53.800
1 to x.,01:04:53.800,01:04:54.680
"All right, so I get theta of
x plus x times log of x plus 1",01:04:59.860,01:05:08.670
over x minus log of 0.,01:05:08.670,01:05:12.790
That's log of 1 is nothing.,01:05:12.790,01:05:15.820
Minus 1.,01:05:15.820,01:05:16.758
"And I'm doing thetas here so I
can forget the low order terms.",01:05:21.160,01:05:27.870
So I get x log x plus 1 minus x.,01:05:27.870,01:05:32.430
"This is the only term
that survives, x log x.",01:05:32.430,01:05:35.400
And that's right.,01:05:40.040,01:05:42.860
"t of n is in fact tilde n log n,
so in fact, it's theta n log n.",01:05:42.860,01:05:47.956
"Now, in this case, going through
the integral and all that,",01:05:53.030,01:05:56.150
"maybe that was harder than
just guessing and verifying.",01:05:56.150,01:05:59.420
"And by the way, guess and verify
got it really the exact answer.",01:05:59.420,01:06:04.060
"The nice thing is this works
for the nasty guys too.",01:06:04.060,01:06:09.730
"In fact, let's figure
out the solution",01:06:09.730,01:06:14.390
"to this thing, which I
guarantee you is a pain",01:06:14.390,01:06:17.950
to do without this method.,01:06:17.950,01:06:21.042
"The first thing to
do is compute p.",01:06:33.520,01:06:37.050
"So to do that, we need to
find a p such that 2 times 1/2",01:06:37.050,01:06:42.610
"to the p plus 8/9 times
3/4 to the p equals 1.",01:06:42.610,01:06:55.270
"I gotta find a p for
which that's true.",01:06:55.270,01:06:57.000
Any guesses what p works?,01:06:59.700,01:07:01.854
p equals 1 not going to do it.,01:07:06.140,01:07:08.460
p equals 2?,01:07:12.170,01:07:14.330
Let's try that.,01:07:14.330,01:07:17.220
"I'd have 2 times 1/4
plus 8/9 times 9/16.",01:07:17.220,01:07:26.000
That looks pretty good.,01:07:26.000,01:07:27.800
I get 1/2 plus 1/2 equals 1.,01:07:27.800,01:07:32.310
So p equals 2 works.,01:07:32.310,01:07:33.430
"All right, so let's
do the integral.",01:07:37.500,01:07:39.337
"tx is theta of x to the p plus
x to the p times the integral.",01:07:42.190,01:07:49.640
"All right, what is g
of x in this thing?",01:07:49.640,01:07:55.170
x squared.,01:07:55.170,01:07:56.670
"So the integral
is 1 to x. g of u",01:07:56.670,01:08:00.240
"is u squared divided
by u to the 1 plus p.",01:08:00.240,01:08:07.580
"u to the 1 plus 2
is just u cubed.",01:08:07.580,01:08:10.276
"This is theta x squared
plus x squared times, well,",01:08:15.860,01:08:20.830
"the integral of 1 over
u is just log of you.",01:08:20.830,01:08:23.140
And that's just log of x.,01:08:29.069,01:08:32.529
"So the answer is,
x square ln of x.",01:08:32.529,01:08:35.390
Done.,01:08:35.390,01:08:38.020
"So that's pretty good
what these guys did.",01:08:38.020,01:08:42.000
"In fact, that is
the correct answer.",01:08:42.000,01:08:47.120
So really easy to pug in.,01:08:47.120,01:08:50.029
Any questions on that?,01:08:50.029,01:08:55.930
Yeah.,01:08:55.930,01:08:57.274
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] or does
it give the actual number?",01:08:57.274,01:09:03.069

"is less than infinity
and bigger than 0.",01:09:13.609,01:09:16.779

it's 10x squared lnx",01:09:18.760,01:09:20.710

because I've got a tilde.",01:09:48.529,01:09:51.560

Any other questions?,01:10:51.430,01:10:52.380
Yeah.,01:10:52.380,01:10:53.364
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,01:10:53.364,01:10:56.190
"TOM LEIGHTON: Ah, good question.",01:10:56.190,01:10:59.480
"Well, let's see.",01:10:59.480,01:11:00.915
It goes back to over here.,01:11:00.915,01:11:03.553
"See, the b's are
between 0 and 1.",01:11:13.340,01:11:15.390
"By making p big enough,
I drive the value down.",01:11:15.390,01:11:19.000
"By making p be large and
negative, I drag the value up.",01:11:19.000,01:11:22.460
So there is some value of p.,01:11:22.460,01:11:23.710
But that's a good question.,01:11:23.710,01:11:25.040
"Let's see what happens
when p is not so nice.",01:11:25.040,01:11:30.310
"Because the examples I gave
you, in one case p was 1",01:11:30.310,01:11:32.565
"and one p was 2, sort of nice.",01:11:32.565,01:11:35.220
Let's look at a bad case there.,01:11:35.220,01:11:37.175
Let's look at this recurrence.,01:11:43.130,01:11:44.523
"3 t of x over 3 plus 4 t
of x over 4 plus x squared.",01:11:50.790,01:12:01.041
"All right, so that's
the recurrence.",01:12:01.041,01:12:02.540
And first step is to compute p.,01:12:02.540,01:12:04.210
"And this time it's
not going to be nice.",01:12:04.210,01:12:07.420
"So I need to find a p such that
3 times 1/3 of the p plus 4",01:12:07.420,01:12:11.890
times 1/4 to the p equals 1.,01:12:11.890,01:12:17.600
"And you might say, OK,
let's try p equals 1.",01:12:17.600,01:12:20.412
I get 1 plus 1 is 2.,01:12:24.500,01:12:29.540
That's too big.,01:12:29.540,01:12:31.850
"So which way do I
have to go on p?",01:12:31.850,01:12:34.010
"Do I need a bigger
p or a smaller p?",01:12:34.010,01:12:37.370
Bigger.,01:12:37.370,01:12:38.230
"Because I got to get
from 2 down to 1.",01:12:38.230,01:12:40.800
"So I know that p
is bigger than 1.",01:12:40.800,01:12:44.241
"All right, so the
next thing to try",01:12:47.190,01:12:49.050
"would be hoping the world
is nice, p equals 2.",01:12:49.050,01:12:54.440
Maybe I'll do that over here.,01:12:54.440,01:12:55.800
Let's try p equals 2.,01:12:55.800,01:12:56.980
"So I get three times
1/9 plus 4 times 1/16",01:13:00.250,01:13:07.190
and that equals a 1/3 plus 1/4.,01:13:07.190,01:13:12.200
That's less than 1.,01:13:12.200,01:13:15.590
That didn't work.,01:13:15.590,01:13:16.300
What do I have to do now with p?,01:13:16.300,01:13:17.633
"Is it bigger than
2 or less than 2?",01:13:17.633,01:13:20.700
Less than 2.,01:13:20.700,01:13:21.647
That's sort of a pain.,01:13:24.940,01:13:26.690
"P is between one and two,
so it's not an integer.",01:13:26.690,01:13:30.270
"Now, you can sort of do
divide and conquer here.",01:13:30.270,01:13:32.400
"Next I'd try p is 3/2,
get my calculator out",01:13:32.400,01:13:36.300
and see which way it goes.,01:13:36.300,01:13:37.870
"And you could sort
of home in on it.",01:13:37.870,01:13:39.980
"But there's
something really nice",01:13:39.980,01:13:41.360
that happens with Akra Bazzi.,01:13:41.360,01:13:45.110
"And that is if you
ever conclude that p",01:13:45.110,01:13:48.450
"is less than your
exponent here, you",01:13:48.450,01:13:52.700
don't even have to compute it.,01:13:52.700,01:13:55.610
Let's see why.,01:13:55.610,01:13:56.407
Let's do an example.,01:13:56.407,01:13:57.240
This will happen a lot.,01:14:02.240,01:14:05.870
"There's some p, but it's just
going to be a pain to evaluate.",01:14:05.870,01:14:08.810
But let's see what happens here.,01:14:08.810,01:14:10.300
"So I'm just going
to try to solve",01:14:14.226,01:14:15.600
"it, write the solution
anyway. t of x",01:14:15.600,01:14:17.810
"equals theta x to the p plus
x to the p integral 1 to x.",01:14:17.810,01:14:25.420
What's g of x?,01:14:25.420,01:14:27.366
x squared.,01:14:27.366,01:14:28.400
"So that's u squared
over u 1 plus p.",01:14:28.400,01:14:33.354
"And I still don't
know what it is,",01:14:33.354,01:14:34.770
"but I'm going to
give it a try here.",01:14:34.770,01:14:39.020
"That's theta x to the
p plus x to the p.",01:14:39.020,01:14:44.150
"Well, this is now the integral
of u to the 1 minus p du.",01:14:44.150,01:14:51.466
And p is bigger than 1.,01:14:51.466,01:14:53.125
I know that.,01:14:53.125,01:14:55.470
"This is theta x to
the p plus x to the p.",01:14:55.470,01:15:02.020
"Well, the integral here
is x to the 2 minus p.",01:15:02.020,01:15:07.880
Up to constants.,01:15:07.880,01:15:08.730
"I don't even care about
dividing by 2 minus p,",01:15:08.730,01:15:10.830
because I got big theta.,01:15:10.830,01:15:13.090
Just put that p up here.,01:15:13.090,01:15:15.920
OK,01:15:15.920,01:15:17.250
"Well, this equals theta x to
the p plus cancelled there,",01:15:17.250,01:15:24.270
x squared.,01:15:24.270,01:15:24.790
"And what's the
answer going to be?",01:15:27.340,01:15:30.280
"x squared, because
p is less than 2.",01:15:30.280,01:15:33.240
So this is a small order term.,01:15:33.240,01:15:36.000
"So I didn't even
know what p was, just",01:15:36.000,01:15:37.950
that it was less than two.,01:15:37.950,01:15:40.020
And I got the answer.,01:15:40.020,01:15:41.235
And what do you know?,01:15:41.235,01:15:42.110
The answer was just this thing.,01:15:42.110,01:15:45.440
That's sort of nice and simple.,01:15:45.440,01:15:48.070
"And in fact, that's a theorem.",01:15:48.070,01:15:51.750
"Which will state, in general, if
g of x equals theta x to the t,",01:15:51.750,01:16:11.900
"for some t bigger
and equal to 0.",01:16:11.900,01:16:13.502
"And when you plug that
value in and take your sum.",01:16:16.320,01:16:21.610
Trying to compute the p value.,01:16:21.610,01:16:22.860
So I take ai times bi to the t.,01:16:22.860,01:16:26.320
"And that comes out
to be less than 1",01:16:26.320,01:16:28.500
"like it did here when I plugged
in p equals 2 and I computed it",01:16:28.500,01:16:34.987
and it was less than 1.,01:16:34.987,01:16:36.970
"But if that happens in
general, then the answer",01:16:36.970,01:16:42.940
is theta g of x.,01:16:42.940,01:16:50.350
Plain and simple.,01:16:50.350,01:16:51.900
"It just turns out to be the g of
x term up to constant factors.",01:16:51.900,01:16:58.460
"So you don't even
have to compute it.",01:16:58.460,01:17:00.430
"Just do that check on
the power here to see",01:17:00.430,01:17:03.280
is it smaller than that.,01:17:03.280,01:17:05.969
I won't prove that there.,01:17:05.969,01:17:07.010
It's actually not hard to do.,01:17:07.010,01:17:08.310
"The proof is pretty much
what I did with this example,",01:17:08.310,01:17:10.980
so it's not too hard.,01:17:10.980,01:17:12.082
"OK, any questions?",01:17:15.820,01:17:16.860
"I want to show you
one more thing,",01:17:19.550,01:17:21.200
but just make sure that's OK.,01:17:21.200,01:17:24.060
"And this is something never to
do with an asymptotic notation,",01:17:24.060,01:17:30.530
like we talked about last time.,01:17:30.530,01:17:33.860
"When you're using Akra Bazzi and
when you're doing occurrences",01:17:33.860,01:17:36.840
"with algorithm, you always
are using asymptotic notation.",01:17:36.840,01:17:41.630
"Your answer is
theta of something.",01:17:41.630,01:17:44.490
"And in fact, what will
start happening is",01:17:44.490,01:17:46.360
"you'll do this stuff because the
constant factors don't matter.",01:17:46.360,01:17:52.470
"Because you're wiping them
out in the theta notation,",01:17:52.470,01:17:55.320
"what you'll see is
things like this.",01:17:55.320,01:17:56.860
"Your recurrence will be set up
to be t of n is 2 t of n over 2",01:17:56.860,01:18:02.300
plus o of n or plus theta of n.,01:18:02.300,01:18:07.230
"And then you'll
conclude that t of n",01:18:07.230,01:18:11.130
"is theta of n log
n using Akra Bazzi",01:18:11.130,01:18:15.550
or whatever method you want.,01:18:15.550,01:18:18.769
"Because it doesn't
really matter what",01:18:18.769,01:18:20.310
"the constant is on g because
the constants disappear.",01:18:20.310,01:18:26.330
Doesn't matter.,01:18:26.330,01:18:27.410
"And so people stop
worrying about it early on.",01:18:27.410,01:18:31.650
"All right, now here's
the bad example.",01:18:31.650,01:18:34.830
"Let me show you a false
proof like last time.",01:18:39.394,01:18:44.230
"And this time I think it'll be
pretty easy to spot the flaw.",01:18:44.230,01:18:47.342
Theorem not.,01:19:01.960,01:19:03.060
"If t of n equals 2 t of
n over 2 plus n minus 1,",01:19:08.630,01:19:16.050
"this is the recurrence we had
for merge sort, and t of 1",01:19:16.050,01:19:20.590
"equals 0, then I'm going to
prove that t of n is o event.",01:19:20.590,01:19:29.118
"Now, that can't be right
because we've proved it's theta",01:19:32.360,01:19:38.150
"then log n, tilde then log n.",01:19:38.150,01:19:40.050
"And that is not o of n, right?",01:19:40.050,01:19:42.340
n log n grows faster than n.,01:19:42.340,01:19:46.190
But let's see the proof.,01:19:46.190,01:19:47.190
By strong induction.,01:19:52.920,01:19:53.911
"The induction
hypothesis is going",01:20:00.720,01:20:04.800
"to be what we're
trying to prove.",01:20:04.800,01:20:07.240
Base case.,01:20:16.770,01:20:19.830
n equals 1.,01:20:19.830,01:20:21.600
t of 1 is 0.,01:20:21.600,01:20:23.810
0 is surely o of 1.,01:20:23.810,01:20:26.050
The induction step.,01:20:29.360,01:20:30.873
"We're going to assume p1, p2,
p3 up to pn minus 1 to prove pn.",01:20:36.370,01:20:41.730
And let's look at p of n.,01:20:55.190,01:20:57.190
"So I look at tn is 2 t of
n over 2 plus n minus 1.",01:20:57.190,01:21:04.820
"Induction hypothesis
on n over 2 says",01:21:04.820,01:21:07.230
"this is 2 times o of n
over 2 plus n minus 1.",01:21:07.230,01:21:12.920
"Twice o of n over 2 is
o of n plus n is o of n.",01:21:12.920,01:21:18.000
This is o of n.,01:21:18.000,01:21:19.780
And I'm done.,01:21:19.780,01:21:22.520
"I just proved that
t of n is o of n.",01:21:22.520,01:21:25.580
What's the bad step?,01:21:28.890,01:21:30.420
What's the bug?,01:21:30.420,01:21:31.050
See the bug?,01:21:33.710,01:21:35.150
What is it?,01:21:35.150,01:21:36.514
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,01:21:36.514,01:21:37.430
"TOM LEIGHTON:
Induction hypothesis.",01:21:37.430,01:21:38.890
What's wrong with that?,01:21:38.890,01:21:40.541
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,01:21:40.541,01:21:41.457
TOM LEIGHTON: Right.,01:21:46.017,01:21:46.850
"The end from the predicate
cannot be in the o of n.",01:21:46.850,01:21:50.260
"Because remember, o of n means,
this statement here by itself",01:21:50.260,01:21:54.930
"means the limit as n goes
to infinity of t of n over n",01:21:54.930,01:22:01.240
is less than infinity.,01:22:01.240,01:22:04.160
"But this makes no sense if I
specified n in a predicate.",01:22:04.160,01:22:10.700
So what's the rule?,01:22:10.700,01:22:11.710
Same rule as last time.,01:22:11.710,01:22:13.290
Same bug.,01:22:13.290,01:22:14.170
What's the rule?,01:22:14.170,01:22:15.075
"Never do asymptotic notation
in induction hypothesis.",01:22:18.360,01:22:21.730
Never mix big o and a predicate.,01:22:21.730,01:22:24.430
"Never, ever.",01:22:24.430,01:22:25.930
"It looks so nice to
do, but it is so wrong.",01:22:25.930,01:22:30.400
It just makes nonsense.,01:22:30.400,01:22:32.910
"All right, very good.",01:22:32.910,01:22:34.430
"So remember ice cream tonight,
recitation optional tomorrow.",01:22:34.430,01:22:39.650
But study session is there.,01:22:39.650,01:22:42.300
