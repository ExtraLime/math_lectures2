Let's get started.,00:00:22.090,00:00:24.030
"Today's topic would be
distributed algorithms.",00:00:24.030,00:00:28.250
"We will look at
two new algorithms.",00:00:28.250,00:00:31.900
"But they are similar to what
you have seen in the lectures.",00:00:31.900,00:00:35.210
"So it will also be a review
of some concepts in lectures.",00:00:35.210,00:00:38.930
"So our first example
would be, again,",00:00:52.250,00:00:56.130
"[INAUDIBLE], the
simplest example.",00:00:56.130,00:00:59.390
"But this time, the network
and topology would be a ring.",00:01:05.670,00:01:11.730
"So in the lectures,
the example we see",00:01:21.810,00:01:25.700
"is a click, meaning they
are fully connected.",00:01:25.700,00:01:28.570
Right.,00:01:28.570,00:01:29.070
"Every node can talk
to every other node.",00:01:29.070,00:01:32.340
"There, if you remember,
our solution for everyone",00:01:32.340,00:01:36.240
"to generate a UID
or a random number.",00:01:36.240,00:01:39.100
"And if you are the maximum, then
you output, you're the leader",00:01:39.100,00:01:45.260
"You can do that because, yeah,
you are connected to everybody.",00:01:45.260,00:01:48.610
"So you immediately know
what random number everybody",00:01:48.610,00:01:52.000
generates.,00:01:52.000,00:01:52.640
"And you can compare whether
you are the largest.",00:01:52.640,00:01:55.870
"Now, the idea is the
same if we have a ring.",00:01:55.870,00:02:00.830
"So you want everyone to
generate a ID or random number.",00:02:00.830,00:02:04.940
I'll just say ID from now on.,00:02:04.940,00:02:07.550
"And you want to collect
everyone else ID",00:02:07.550,00:02:11.780
"so that you know
whether your ID is",00:02:11.780,00:02:13.840
the largest among all of them.,00:02:13.840,00:02:18.326
OK.,00:02:18.326,00:02:18.826
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:02:24.754,00:02:28.212

LING REN: OK.,00:02:34.289,00:02:34.830
"The question is where did
the comparison happen?",00:02:34.830,00:02:39.270
"So we first need
some way to pass",00:02:39.270,00:02:42.200
"the numbers around
such that everyone",00:02:42.200,00:02:44.810
has everyone else's number.,00:02:44.810,00:02:47.370
Right.,00:02:47.370,00:02:47.870
"You have the number
of everyone, then",00:02:47.870,00:02:49.460
"you can compare whether
the largest equals yours.",00:02:49.460,00:02:52.791
OK.,00:02:52.791,00:02:53.290
"If the largest equals
yours, then you",00:02:53.290,00:02:55.000
know you are the largest.,00:02:55.000,00:02:56.041
"And you're going to
output, I'm the leader.",00:02:56.041,00:03:01.130
OK.,00:03:01.130,00:03:01.630
"So the difficulty is just
how to pass the numbers",00:03:01.630,00:03:05.300
"around so that everyone
sees everyone else's number.",00:03:05.300,00:03:08.220
Any ideas?,00:03:11.120,00:03:12.790
Simple solution.,00:03:12.790,00:03:13.520
"Well, there's not
much you can do.",00:03:39.755,00:03:41.590
"You are just connect to your
two neighbors, the left one",00:03:41.590,00:03:43.990
and the right one.,00:03:43.990,00:03:44.740
"So how do you propagate
the information?",00:03:54.800,00:03:56.835
Go ahead.,00:04:06.134,00:04:07.130
"AUDIENCE: You can take
the maximum of your ID",00:04:07.130,00:04:10.616
"and neighbor's IDs and
kind of broadcast that.",00:04:10.616,00:04:14.579
LING REN: OK.,00:04:14.579,00:04:15.120
"So what does
broadcast mean here?",00:04:15.120,00:04:16.519
"AUDIENCE: Like
tell your neighbors",00:04:16.519,00:04:17.935
"what the largest of
your value [INAUDIBLE]",00:04:17.935,00:04:21.720
LING REN: OK.,00:04:21.720,00:04:23.230
And yes.,00:04:23.230,00:04:25.170
"Let me call them A, B, C, E,
F. Then, yes, C can tell D",00:04:25.170,00:04:32.650
"or can tell B, but
how does C tell E?",00:04:32.650,00:04:35.167
"AUDIENCE: It waited around to
I guess propagate the maximum.",00:04:41.498,00:04:47.267
LING REN: Yep.,00:04:47.267,00:04:47.850
"So it would be just,
say, everyone talks",00:04:47.850,00:04:53.970
to its right neighbor.,00:04:53.970,00:04:55.660
"And then B has A's IDs, C
these B's ID, D has C's ID,",00:04:55.660,00:04:58.930
"and then continue and
pass around next time.",00:04:58.930,00:05:02.360
"So just to make
it perfect clear.",00:05:05.390,00:05:08.260
"Say they generate some
random IDs that's 5, 10, 20.",00:05:08.260,00:05:15.280
"And then in the next round,
A would send its ID to B, B",00:05:15.280,00:05:19.035
"would send its ID to C,
C would send its ID to D.",00:05:19.035,00:05:22.470
"And in the next round, B would
pass this information along",00:05:22.470,00:05:25.520
"to C. And C would pass
the information to D.",00:05:25.520,00:05:28.930
And just continue.,00:05:28.930,00:05:31.320
"And eventually everyone will
have everyone else's ID.",00:05:31.320,00:05:36.240
So how many rounds do we need?,00:05:36.240,00:05:38.720
"If they are in
nodes in the system.",00:05:51.790,00:05:58.001
"AUDIENCE: I think probably
in just one direction or two",00:05:58.001,00:06:00.292
neighbors.,00:06:00.292,00:06:02.110
"LING REN: I think you
can do it either way.",00:06:02.110,00:06:05.190
"If you propagate both ways,
it probably 2x faster, yeah.",00:06:05.190,00:06:09.914
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:06:09.914,00:06:11.390
"LING REN: Yeah, correct.",00:06:11.390,00:06:12.870
It's just O(n).,00:06:12.870,00:06:14.700
"But to keep it simple,
let's say we just",00:06:14.700,00:06:16.810
propagate in one direction.,00:06:16.810,00:06:18.240
That's also fine.,00:06:18.240,00:06:19.030
Still O(n).,00:06:19.030,00:06:21.340
"So how many messages
are sent in total?",00:06:21.340,00:06:25.983
AUDIENCE: n squared.,00:06:25.983,00:06:28.388
LING REN: Pardon?,00:06:28.388,00:06:29.487

LING REN: n squared.,00:06:30.320,00:06:31.399
Yep.,00:06:31.399,00:06:31.898
Is that obvious to everyone?,00:06:34.590,00:06:37.660
OK.,00:06:37.660,00:06:38.160
Give an explanation.,00:06:38.160,00:06:40.132
"AUDIENCE: Yeah, at
each round everyone",00:06:40.132,00:06:41.715
"sends a message
to its neighbors.",00:06:41.715,00:06:44.900
LING REN: Yeah.,00:06:44.900,00:06:45.900
Yeah.,00:06:45.900,00:06:48.030
"Every round, everyone
sends a message.",00:06:48.030,00:06:50.350
"Or you can think of every
message as propagated n times.",00:06:50.350,00:06:54.550
"And there are n
messages in total.",00:06:54.550,00:06:58.700
OK.,00:06:58.700,00:07:00.171
Yeah.,00:07:00.171,00:07:00.670
That's definitely a solution.,00:07:00.670,00:07:04.180
"Well, you can imagine, it's
probably the naive solution.",00:07:04.180,00:07:07.000
And can we do better than that?,00:07:07.000,00:07:09.220
"AUDIENCE: In this case,
are we assuming they",00:07:14.566,00:07:16.996

LING REN: OK.,00:07:21.380,00:07:22.280
Good question.,00:07:22.280,00:07:23.370
"So if they know
there are n of them,",00:07:23.370,00:07:25.989
"yep, then they know
how to terminate.",00:07:25.989,00:07:27.530
"So your question is how
to terminate, right?",00:07:27.530,00:07:30.230
"If they don't, eventually
you will receive your own ID",00:07:30.230,00:07:35.070
on the other side.,00:07:35.070,00:07:36.230
"If we keep sending

on the left port.",00:07:38.850,00:07:40.600
"And, yeah, that's an
indication of termination.",00:07:40.600,00:07:44.265
Question?,00:07:47.498,00:07:47.998
"AUDIENCE: Are we
assuming the trajectory",00:07:47.998,00:07:49.664

LING REN: Yeah.,00:07:51.165,00:07:51.790
"We usually assume that, yeah.",00:07:51.790,00:07:55.480
"Either it's a unique
user-- sorry, UID.",00:07:55.480,00:08:00.420
"What does U stand
for by the way?",00:08:00.420,00:08:02.260
"Or if you generate random

"it's very unlikely
that they collide.",00:08:06.630,00:08:08.180
OK.,00:08:20.560,00:08:21.230
So can we do better than that?,00:08:21.230,00:08:22.480
You have some idea?,00:08:37.990,00:08:40.700
"AUDIENCE: Once
something [INAUDIBLE]",00:08:40.700,00:08:47.560
"where you only pass it
to the one that's bigger.",00:08:47.560,00:08:52.204
LING REN: Hm-mm.,00:08:52.204,00:08:52.870
OK.,00:08:52.870,00:08:53.200
I think you have two ideas.,00:08:53.200,00:08:54.490
"And binary search, we'll
see how that works later.",00:08:54.490,00:08:58.080
"So you said only forward
something that's larger?",00:08:58.080,00:09:01.250

forward things are larger.",00:09:02.580,00:09:04.746
"LING REN: OK, yeah,
that's on the right track.",00:09:08.014,00:09:09.930
"So one obvious
thing we can do is",00:09:09.930,00:09:13.730
"that so we actually don't care
what all the IDs are, right.",00:09:13.730,00:09:18.920
"We only care whether a
certain ID's the largest.",00:09:18.920,00:09:23.100
"So for example, in this case,
when A send its ID 5 to B,",00:09:23.100,00:09:29.060
"B knows this 5
won't be the leader.",00:09:29.060,00:09:32.210
All right.,00:09:32.210,00:09:32.710
Because 5 is too small.,00:09:32.710,00:09:33.970
It's even smaller than his ID.,00:09:33.970,00:09:36.220
"So we can choose to
drop this message.",00:09:36.220,00:09:40.190
"There's no point in passing
that message further.",00:09:40.190,00:09:44.720
Same thing for this message.,00:09:44.720,00:09:46.810
C knows that 10 is too small.,00:09:46.810,00:09:49.420
"And it doesn't have
to pass it along.",00:09:49.420,00:09:53.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:09:53.980,00:09:57.452
"LING REN: Oh, the ID?",00:09:58.940,00:09:59.940
"It's just the integer each
node chooses at random.",00:09:59.940,00:10:03.460
See.,00:10:03.460,00:10:06.210
"Yeah, the only purpose of
the ID is to break symmetry.",00:10:06.210,00:10:10.280
"So, yeah.",00:10:10.280,00:10:11.720
"Like we have seen the lecture,
if they don't do this,",00:10:11.720,00:10:14.230
"if they don't have
any unique identifier,",00:10:14.230,00:10:17.284
"they won't be able
to select the leader.",00:10:17.284,00:10:18.950
"And when they have
a unique number,",00:10:21.570,00:10:25.120
"then they can select, yeah,
the largest one or smallest",00:10:25.120,00:10:28.100
one in some way.,00:10:28.100,00:10:30.210
OK.,00:10:34.490,00:10:34.990
"Does this optimization
make sense?",00:10:34.990,00:10:37.190
"We can cut [INAUDIBLE]
messages that",00:10:37.190,00:10:42.650
"have no chance of
becoming the leader.",00:10:42.650,00:10:47.365
"AUDIENCE: What is the
upper bound of it?",00:10:47.365,00:10:49.031
Is it still n squared?,00:10:49.031,00:10:51.310
LING REN: Correct.,00:10:51.310,00:10:52.060
Yeah.,00:10:52.060,00:10:52.559
"That's a very good question and
very good answer, by the way.",00:10:52.559,00:10:57.300
But how effective is this?,00:10:57.300,00:11:00.660
"Well in average case, we may
be able to drop some messages.",00:11:00.660,00:11:04.510
"But there pathological
case where it actually",00:11:04.510,00:11:08.190
doesn't help at all.,00:11:08.190,00:11:09.270
Say this is the ID we choose.,00:11:09.270,00:11:12.530
"Then when there's
20, it send around.",00:11:12.530,00:11:15.450
B cannot drop it.,00:11:15.450,00:11:17.180
"Right, because it
may be the largest.",00:11:17.180,00:11:20.320
"And when this 10 is sent
to C, C cannot drop it.",00:11:20.320,00:11:23.240
"And when 20 comes along,
it also cannot drop it.",00:11:23.240,00:11:26.130
So no node can drop any message.,00:11:26.130,00:11:30.420
"Its worst case is
still n square.",00:11:30.420,00:11:32.585
OK.,00:11:51.770,00:11:52.270
"So let's think about the
binary search equivalent, yeah,",00:11:52.270,00:11:58.320
"or how to binary
search in this case.",00:11:58.320,00:12:00.240

the first difficulty",00:14:02.877,00:14:04.460

you cut it by half,",00:14:04.460,00:14:06.870

"Let the weak candidates
shut up early.",00:15:07.380,00:15:10.030

we have several round, so this B",00:15:12.630,00:15:17.790

only propagate to A and C first.",00:15:17.790,00:15:25.690

we will let a node",00:16:00.910,00:16:07.950

the number of round.",00:18:50.160,00:18:56.150

"And every node when
forwarding the message",00:19:05.420,00:19:08.170
will decrease the that h by 1.,00:19:08.170,00:19:12.220

This message I should say ID.,00:19:36.220,00:19:41.040

it means like these two",00:22:27.180,00:22:29.350

OK.,00:22:56.285,00:22:58.710
And there are two directions.,00:22:58.710,00:23:00.955

send the message forward",00:23:08.400,00:23:11.760

Does this algorithm work?,00:30:09.060,00:30:12.455
"Yeah, I don't see any problem.",00:30:12.455,00:30:13.790
OK.,00:30:22.376,00:30:23.810
"But let me still repeat
what our algorithm",00:30:23.810,00:30:28.650
"is because it's closer
to what's in the lecture.",00:30:28.650,00:30:34.900
"So we're going to find a
spanning tree of this network.",00:30:34.900,00:30:42.305
"A spanning tree
means, well, like I",00:30:44.960,00:30:47.720
have to cut one of these edges.,00:30:47.720,00:30:49.135
"If I have a tree, then I
can have every child report",00:30:52.840,00:30:56.860
to its parent.,00:30:56.860,00:30:58.610
"Like how many offsprings,
including myself do I have.",00:30:58.610,00:31:05.130
"And this node will sum
up all its children",00:31:05.130,00:31:11.510
and report to its parent.,00:31:11.510,00:31:12.670
Does everyone get that?,00:31:18.370,00:31:20.440
"So first, we'll find
a spanning tree.",00:31:20.440,00:31:23.550
"And second, we'll have
child reports to parent.",00:31:29.466,00:31:37.154
"AUDIENCE: How can we
find the spanning tree?",00:31:50.790,00:31:54.470
LING REN: Good question.,00:31:54.470,00:31:55.470
"So in the lecture, we
have seen algorithm",00:31:55.470,00:31:59.770
"that find BFS spanning tree
for synchronous networks.",00:31:59.770,00:32:12.105
OK.,00:32:15.330,00:32:15.830
This is review of the lecture.,00:32:15.830,00:32:17.380
How does it work?,00:32:20.732,00:32:21.440
"Each node will, say, we
need to first choose a root.",00:32:35.290,00:32:39.280
"And our root will just send
a message to its neighbor",00:32:39.280,00:32:43.350
"and, yeah, saying, you are
my child, you are my child,",00:32:43.350,00:32:46.950
you are my child.,00:32:46.950,00:32:49.000
"And then every node upon
receiving this message",00:32:49.000,00:32:53.300
"from the parent will
search among its neighbors.",00:32:53.300,00:33:00.724
All right.,00:33:00.724,00:33:01.690
"So the neighbors that
haven't got a parent",00:33:01.690,00:33:04.260
"will acknowledge this
sender as the parent.",00:33:04.260,00:33:08.515
OK.,00:33:12.400,00:33:12.900
That's a little messy.,00:33:12.900,00:33:13.910
"So this node will
search to the leaf node.",00:33:27.650,00:33:33.380
"But then it will also try
to search for this guy.",00:33:33.380,00:33:36.250
"But this guy already had
a parent, then, yeah,",00:33:36.250,00:33:38.630
"it will say I already got a
parent and blah, blah, blah.",00:33:38.630,00:33:44.210
"This will give us a
BFS spanning tree.",00:33:44.210,00:33:47.330
What does it mean?,00:33:47.330,00:33:48.080
"It's a spanning
tree found by BFS.",00:33:48.080,00:33:50.075
"Does it work for
asynchronous network?",00:33:52.620,00:33:54.680
Go ahead.,00:33:59.680,00:34:00.395
AUDIENCE: This version doesn't.,00:34:00.395,00:34:01.172
"But there's a
different version that",00:34:01.172,00:34:02.672
"contains an edge for
relaxation technique.",00:34:02.672,00:34:05.110
LING REN: Yeah.,00:34:05.110,00:34:05.840
Correct.,00:34:05.840,00:34:06.470
"And so why does this version not
work for a synchronous network?",00:34:06.470,00:34:10.931
"AUDIENCE: Because
different nodes",00:34:10.931,00:34:12.306
"can be on a different
round number",00:34:12.306,00:34:14.290
"so that a longer path could
end up going to the node even.",00:34:14.290,00:34:18.270
"LING REN: Yeah, exactly.",00:34:18.270,00:34:19.290
"So let me give a
concrete example.",00:34:19.290,00:34:23.030
"What does asynchronous
network mean?",00:34:23.030,00:34:25.080
"Is that, well, messages
travel at different speed.",00:34:25.080,00:34:28.580
"Say this link for some
reason is temporarily down.",00:34:28.580,00:34:32.760
"And this node doesn't receive
the message from the root.",00:34:32.760,00:34:37.030
"And then this message
travels very fast.",00:34:37.030,00:34:41.210
"And this message also
travels very fast.",00:34:41.210,00:34:43.000
"So this message may
reach this node earlier.",00:34:43.000,00:34:47.480
"And then this node will think
of it as a child of this node.",00:34:47.480,00:34:52.300
OK.,00:34:52.300,00:34:52.850
"And then this message
comes along, finally.",00:34:52.850,00:34:55.889
"But this node says, yeah,
I already have a parent.",00:34:55.889,00:34:58.490
And I'm going to reject you.,00:34:58.490,00:35:00.870
"AUDIENCE: So it still
makes a spanning tree?",00:35:00.870,00:35:03.070
LING REN: Yes.,00:35:03.070,00:35:04.220
Good point.,00:35:04.220,00:35:05.330
"This is not a BFS spanning tree
but it's still a spanning tree.",00:35:05.330,00:35:09.143
All right.,00:35:09.143,00:35:09.870
"So in our problem, we're
totally fine with it.",00:35:09.870,00:35:12.600
Yeah.,00:35:16.340,00:35:16.840
"But you do have to know if
you really want a BFS spanning",00:35:16.840,00:35:20.210
"tree in an asynchronous
network, then",00:35:20.210,00:35:22.580
"you have to like record the
distance and do the relaxation",00:35:22.580,00:35:25.002
and so on and so forth.,00:35:25.002,00:35:25.960
OK.,00:35:29.229,00:35:30.170
"So we will just use this
algorithm, the BFS spanning",00:35:30.170,00:35:33.740
"tree algorithm, just
run it asynchronously.",00:35:33.740,00:35:37.139
"It doesn't find the
BFS spanning tree",00:35:37.139,00:35:38.680
but it finds some spanning tree.,00:35:38.680,00:35:40.610
OK.,00:35:46.990,00:35:47.490
How does this algorithm work?,00:35:47.490,00:35:48.850
We will have several variables.,00:35:56.290,00:35:58.030
The first one is parent.,00:35:58.030,00:36:01.510
"We will initialize to
this undefined single.",00:36:01.510,00:36:04.540
OK.,00:36:13.900,00:36:14.900
"Then every node will pass
around this search message.",00:36:14.900,00:36:20.350
"I'll use a slightly
more shorthand notation",00:36:20.350,00:36:23.170
than from the lecture.,00:36:23.170,00:36:24.185
OK.,00:36:32.746,00:36:33.250
"Let's say the code I
wrote is for a process u.",00:36:33.250,00:36:38.920
OK.,00:36:42.392,00:36:44.880
"If we receive a message,
a search message, from v",00:36:44.880,00:36:51.410
"to u, that means u-- sorry, v
is trying to become a parent.",00:36:51.410,00:37:01.135
OK.,00:37:01.135,00:37:01.635
"And if I do not
have a parent yet,",00:37:05.130,00:37:11.530
"I should set the
parent to v. OK.",00:37:11.530,00:37:25.310
So what's the next step?,00:37:25.310,00:37:26.432
"Now, we got this search
message from our parent.",00:37:38.990,00:37:41.120
And we have to pass it along.,00:37:41.120,00:37:43.200
"AUDIENCE: Should we
send it to the like",00:37:49.687,00:37:52.431
add your child [INAUDIBLE].,00:37:52.431,00:37:53.690
"LING REN: Oh, yeah.",00:37:53.690,00:37:54.830
Great.,00:37:54.830,00:37:55.330
"Yeah, we first need to
respond by saying, OK,",00:37:58.746,00:38:03.310
I'll use a shorter notation.,00:38:03.310,00:38:07.300
"Send these a cue that
that's the message that will",00:38:07.300,00:38:12.860
be sent to v at some point.,00:38:12.860,00:38:14.640
The message we send is parent 1.,00:38:17.350,00:38:21.330
Parent 2.,00:38:21.330,00:38:23.640
"This is a response to v saying,
yeah, you are my parent.",00:38:23.640,00:38:30.107
OK.,00:38:34.400,00:38:34.990

respond by saying parent 0.",00:38:34.990,00:38:50.720
"You are not my parent because I
already got some other parent.",00:38:50.720,00:38:54.820
OK.,00:38:54.820,00:38:55.320
Missing a step here.,00:38:55.320,00:38:56.474
If we receive a search message.,00:39:03.590,00:39:05.255
Go ahead.,00:39:05.255,00:39:06.500
"AUDIENCE: We send messages
to all the other nodes.",00:39:06.500,00:39:08.935

"We need to pass it to all
my potential children.",00:39:09.560,00:39:17.170
"So I use this comma u,
meaning the neighbors of u.",00:39:17.170,00:39:26.050
"And then I'll send
them a message.",00:39:26.050,00:39:27.870
What message?,00:39:31.959,00:39:32.500
Search.,00:39:35.410,00:39:35.910
OK.,00:39:47.041,00:39:47.540
OK.,00:39:59.465,00:39:59.965
"So, well, naturally since
we have a search message",00:39:59.965,00:40:06.000
"and we know how to
deal with it, now we",00:40:06.000,00:40:08.130

with better deal with it.",00:40:08.130,00:40:10.620
Right.,00:40:10.620,00:40:11.940

"be if we receive this parent
message, I'll say parent b,",00:40:15.940,00:40:25.030

I'm still u here.,00:40:38.700,00:40:40.780

this particular w",00:40:55.930,00:41:03.530
take me as its parent.,00:41:03.530,00:41:06.810
Make sense?,00:41:06.810,00:41:09.360
OK.,00:41:09.360,00:41:10.210
"So I'd better have a

I want to keep track of that.,00:41:14.280,00:41:16.500
How?,00:41:16.500,00:41:17.000

"Yeah, empty set.",00:41:32.100,00:41:33.190
"And now if this b

to put w in this children list.,00:41:42.040,00:41:45.182
OK.,00:41:49.910,00:41:51.170
"I'm leaving some space

"So if u equals root,
we say the root is v0.",00:42:14.130,00:42:20.800

Give me a minute.,00:46:27.975,00:46:29.130
"In this case, I'm going to
send my parent a message.",00:46:29.130,00:46:34.780
"This is the step
of converge cast.",00:46:34.780,00:46:38.460
What do I send?,00:46:38.460,00:46:39.257
I'm going to send them I'm done.,00:46:39.257,00:46:40.590
OK.,00:46:48.318,00:46:49.780
"Then whenever we
create a message,",00:46:49.780,00:46:52.620
"we should deal
with that message.",00:46:52.620,00:46:56.440
"If we receive a message
I'm done, what do we do?",00:46:56.440,00:47:02.821
OK.,00:47:02.821,00:47:03.320
"From w, then we're going
to mark that node as done.",00:47:03.320,00:47:11.480
OK.,00:47:26.030,00:47:26.830
There's this other point.,00:47:26.830,00:47:28.470
"So someone has to
initiate the done signal.",00:47:28.470,00:47:32.450
"That's going to be
our leaves, right.",00:47:32.450,00:47:34.550
"Because when this
condition check,",00:47:34.550,00:47:37.160
they don't have any children.,00:47:37.160,00:47:38.510
"Their children
list is empty set.",00:47:38.510,00:47:40.130
"And their done list
is also empty set.",00:47:40.130,00:47:42.270
"But they're going to send
the I'm done signal first.",00:47:42.270,00:47:45.580
"And then in the
median nodes, we'll",00:47:45.580,00:47:47.740
"send a done signal when
all its children are done.",00:47:47.740,00:47:52.281
All right.,00:47:52.281,00:47:52.780
"So this is the
converged cast version.",00:47:52.780,00:47:57.150
"Only gives us a
termination point",00:47:57.150,00:48:00.930
of our spanning tree search.,00:48:00.930,00:48:04.380
"We haven't count the number
of nodes in the network.",00:48:04.380,00:48:08.090
But that's a small modification.,00:48:11.072,00:48:15.330
"We're just going to include that
number in the I'm done signal.",00:48:15.330,00:48:19.700
"So then I need to define
another variable called",00:48:19.700,00:48:24.190
total that's initialized to 0.,00:48:24.190,00:48:27.460
"This variable will
attract how many",00:48:27.460,00:48:31.040
"nodes do I have in
my subtree, including",00:48:31.040,00:48:35.560
me and all my children.,00:48:35.560,00:48:36.720
"Then when I send
the I'm done signal,",00:48:39.740,00:48:43.040
I'm going to send this-- sorry.,00:48:43.040,00:48:47.370
That's not right way.,00:48:47.370,00:48:50.700
"When I'm sending
the I'm done signal,",00:48:50.700,00:48:52.790
"I'm going to send my total
number of offspring with it.",00:48:52.790,00:48:57.980
"And when I receive,
one of my children",00:48:57.980,00:49:03.330
"reports that I do
have t children.",00:49:03.330,00:49:05.110
"I need to increment my
total by that amount.",00:49:08.310,00:49:12.070
OK.,00:49:21.601,00:49:22.100
I made a mistake again.,00:49:22.100,00:49:24.240
Should be total plus 1.,00:49:24.240,00:49:28.060
Right.,00:49:28.060,00:49:29.010
"Because I'm counting
all my children and then",00:49:29.010,00:49:30.930
I should include myself.,00:49:30.930,00:49:32.030
"So that's the
complete algorithm.",00:49:43.426,00:49:44.800
Yeah.,00:49:49.370,00:49:49.870
"One purpose is just to create
a different angle to look",00:49:49.870,00:49:53.970
at distributed algorithm.,00:49:53.970,00:49:55.070
"Usually just draw
that network graphs.",00:49:55.070,00:49:58.310
"But sometimes it's
helpful to think about how",00:49:58.310,00:50:00.980
the code actually works.,00:50:00.980,00:50:02.227
OK.,00:50:05.703,00:50:06.203
That's all for today.,00:50:10.180,00:50:12.170
