"PROFESSOR: All right, we've
got some good competition here.",00:00:22.630,00:00:25.570
"So let's actually
work through it.",00:00:25.570,00:00:27.560
"So I have a function
called always sunny",00:00:34.220,00:00:37.070
"and it's going to take in two
variables right, t1 and t2.",00:00:37.070,00:00:42.050
"And I'm calling it
with cloudy and cold.",00:00:42.050,00:00:47.810
"So when I do my
function call, t1",00:00:47.810,00:00:51.770
is going to be equal to cloudy.,00:00:51.770,00:00:56.465
"These are strings
but I'm not going",00:00:59.140,00:01:01.810
to bother putting the quotes.,00:01:01.810,00:01:03.910
And t2 is equal to cold comma.,00:01:03.910,00:01:10.840
"So remember what I said,
with a comma it's a tuple,",00:01:10.840,00:01:15.180
without a comma it's a string.,00:01:15.180,00:01:17.280
"So t1 is actually
going to be a string.",00:01:17.280,00:01:20.930
And t2 is actually a tuple.,00:01:20.930,00:01:23.090
OK.,00:01:23.090,00:01:23.835
"So that's the first sort
of trick to this question.",00:01:23.835,00:01:25.960
"So I've made my function call
and I've assigned t1 and t2",00:01:29.230,00:01:32.040
to be those two values.,00:01:32.040,00:01:35.970
"So the next line is sun is
equal to sunny comma sun.",00:01:35.970,00:01:39.910
"So sun is going to be
this tuple of two strings.",00:01:39.910,00:01:42.175
"The next line is figuring
out what first is.",00:01:44.820,00:01:50.250
"So first is going to be-- so
I'm looking at my t1 here,",00:01:50.250,00:01:57.350
it's a string.,00:01:57.350,00:01:58.939
"The fact that I have
parentheses doesn't actually",00:01:58.939,00:02:00.980
"make a difference when
I'm talking about strings.",00:02:00.980,00:02:05.801
Like that.,00:02:05.801,00:02:06.300
"So when I'm indexing into
a string, t1 at position 0",00:02:09.229,00:02:13.550
"actually just gives
me a C because it's",00:02:13.550,00:02:17.070
a string not a tuple.,00:02:17.070,00:02:18.050
"And t2 up position zero
says, OK well, this",00:02:22.240,00:02:26.200
"is a tuple that contains
only one element.",00:02:26.200,00:02:28.900
"That element being
at position 0,",00:02:28.900,00:02:31.870
"and that element is
the string, cold.",00:02:31.870,00:02:34.150
So this is a tuple.,00:02:37.670,00:02:39.090
"So I'm taking everything
right before the first comma.",00:02:39.090,00:02:42.861
"And that happens to be just the
one element that's in there.",00:02:42.861,00:02:45.360
"So this is just
the string C cold.",00:02:48.150,00:02:50.160
"And then I'm returning
here a tuple.",00:02:53.780,00:02:57.730
"And the tuple I'm returning
is sun at position 0,",00:02:57.730,00:03:01.290
so that's just sunny comma.,00:03:01.290,00:03:07.520
Just doing what's in here.,00:03:07.520,00:03:09.590
"And then first, and first
was this string, C cold.",00:03:09.590,00:03:13.574
"So really the important
thing about this example",00:03:16.960,00:03:20.291
"was to make sure
that you understand",00:03:20.291,00:03:21.790
"the difference between what a
string is and what a tuple is.",00:03:21.790,00:03:26.610
