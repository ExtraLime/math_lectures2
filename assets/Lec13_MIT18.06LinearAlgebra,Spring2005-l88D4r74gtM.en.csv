OK.,00:00:09.510,00:00:10.100
"Uh this is the review
lecture for the first part",00:00:10.100,00:00:16.500
"of the course, the Ax=b
part of the course.",00:00:16.500,00:00:21.880
"And the exam will
emphasize chapter three.",00:00:21.880,00:00:28.710
"Because those are
the --0 chapter",00:00:28.710,00:00:31.890
"three was about the
rectangular matrices",00:00:31.890,00:00:34.940
"where we had null spaces and
null spaces of A transpose,",00:00:34.940,00:00:39.750
"and ranks, and all
the things that",00:00:39.750,00:00:43.450
"are so clear when the matrix
is square and invertible,",00:00:43.450,00:00:49.890
"they became things to think
about for rectangular matrices.",00:00:49.890,00:00:57.080
"So, and vector spaces and
subspaces and above all",00:00:57.080,00:01:01.590
those four subspaces.,00:01:01.590,00:01:04.400
"OK, I'm thinking to
start at least I'll",00:01:04.400,00:01:07.940
"just look at old exams,
read out questions, write",00:01:07.940,00:01:13.210
"on the board what
I need to and we",00:01:13.210,00:01:15.320
can see what the answers are.,00:01:15.320,00:01:17.980
"The first one I see is
one I can just read out.",00:01:17.980,00:01:22.420
"Well, I'll write a little.",00:01:22.420,00:01:23.930
"Suppose u, v and w are
nonzero vectors in R^7.",00:01:23.930,00:01:32.145
"What are the possible -- they
span a -- a vector space.",00:01:39.230,00:01:44.190
"They span a subspace of R^7,
and what are the possible",00:01:44.190,00:01:47.510
dimensions?,00:01:47.510,00:01:49.130
"So that's a
straightforward question,",00:01:49.130,00:01:50.840
"what are the possible dimensions
of the subspace spanned",00:01:50.840,00:01:55.610
"by u, v and w?",00:01:55.610,00:01:58.040
"OK, one, two, or three, right.",00:01:58.040,00:02:03.430
"One, two or three.",00:02:03.430,00:02:05.320
"Couldn't be more because
we've only got three vectors,",00:02:05.320,00:02:08.930
and couldn't be zero because --,00:02:08.930,00:02:12.430
"because I told you the
vectors were nonzero.",00:02:15.580,00:02:19.030
"Otherwise if I allowed the
possibility that those were all",00:02:19.030,00:02:23.020
"the zero vector -- then the
zero-dimensional subspace would",00:02:23.020,00:02:27.319
have been in there.,00:02:27.319,00:02:28.110
OK.,00:02:28.110,00:02:29.250
"Now can I jump to a
more serious question?",00:02:29.250,00:02:35.970
OK.,00:02:35.970,00:02:37.600
We have a five by three matrix.,00:02:37.600,00:02:41.850
And I'm calling it U.,00:02:41.850,00:02:44.860
I'm saying it's in echelon form.,00:02:44.860,00:02:47.010
"And it has three pivots, r=3.",00:02:47.010,00:02:50.600
Three pivots.,00:02:50.600,00:02:51.810
Ok.,00:02:57.560,00:02:58.140
"First question what's
the null space?",00:02:58.140,00:03:01.820
"What's the null
space of this matrix",00:03:01.820,00:03:03.865
"U, so this matrix is five by
three, and I find it helpful to",00:03:03.865,00:03:11.910
just see,00:03:11.910,00:03:13.860
"visually what five by three
means, what that shape is.",00:03:13.860,00:03:17.750
Three columns.,00:03:17.750,00:03:19.420
"Three columns in U,",00:03:19.420,00:03:20.810
"then five rows,",00:03:20.810,00:03:23.040
"three pivots,",00:03:23.040,00:03:24.430
and what's the null space?,00:03:24.430,00:03:26.650
The null space of U is --,00:03:26.650,00:03:29.360
"and it asks for a
spec-of course I'm",00:03:29.360,00:03:33.000
"looking for an answer
that isn't just",00:03:33.000,00:03:35.390
"the definition of
the null space,",00:03:35.390,00:03:37.340
"but is the null space of this
matrix, with this information.",00:03:37.340,00:03:42.030
And what is it?,00:03:42.030,00:03:44.220
It's only the zero vector.,00:03:44.220,00:03:46.110
"Because we're told
that the rank is three,",00:03:46.110,00:03:48.810
"so those three columns must be
independent, no combination --",00:03:48.810,00:03:53.840
"of those columns is the
zero vector except --",00:03:53.840,00:03:58.890
"so the only thing in this
null space is the zero vector,",00:03:58.890,00:04:01.671
and I --,00:04:01.671,00:04:02.170
"I could even say what that
vector is, zero, columns also?",00:04:02.170,00:04:05.030
"zero, zero.",00:04:05.030,00:04:06.200
That's OK.,00:04:06.200,00:04:07.870
"So that's what's
in the null space.",00:04:07.870,00:04:10.020
"All right? let me go on with
-- this question has multiple",00:04:10.020,00:04:15.015
parts.,00:04:15.015,00:04:15.515
"What's the -- oh now it asks you
about a ten by three matrix, B,",00:04:18.089,00:04:24.950
which is the matrix U and two U.,00:04:24.950,00:04:31.530
"It actually -- I would
probably be writing R --",00:04:31.530,00:04:37.340
"and maybe I should be
writing R here now.",00:04:37.340,00:04:40.630
"This exam goes back a few
years when I emphasized U more",00:04:40.630,00:04:47.800
than R.,00:04:47.800,00:04:49.980
"Now, what's the echelon
form for that matrix?",00:04:49.980,00:04:54.630
"So the echelon form,
what's the rank,",00:04:54.630,00:04:57.150
"Yes. and what's
the echelon form?",00:04:57.150,00:04:59.125
"Let's suppose this is
in reduced echelon form,",00:05:04.160,00:05:06.270
"so that I could be
using the letter R.",00:05:06.270,00:05:06.360
"So I'll ask for the reduced row
echelon form so imagine that",00:05:06.360,00:05:06.480
"So I'm seeing the same length
in b, three, and also in x.",00:05:06.480,00:05:06.610
these are --,00:05:06.610,00:05:07.110
"U is in reduced row
echelon form but now",00:05:07.110,00:05:09.880
"I've doubled the
height of the matrix,",00:05:09.880,00:05:15.500
"So the (x)-s that it multiplies
have three components,",00:05:15.500,00:05:22.720
"what will happen when
we do row reduction?",00:05:22.720,00:05:29.150
"What row reduction will
take us to what matrix here?",00:05:29.150,00:05:32.950
So you start doing elimination.,00:05:39.170,00:05:42.270
"You're doing elimination
on single rows.",00:05:42.270,00:05:44.590
"But of course we're
allowed to think of blocks.",00:05:44.590,00:05:48.050
"So what, well, what's
the answer look like?",00:05:48.050,00:05:51.820
U and z- or R --,00:05:51.820,00:05:53.921
"let's -- I'll stay with this
letter U but I'm what was",00:05:53.921,00:05:56.170
"the name of that --2 winning
a million dollars or really",00:05:56.170,00:05:56.660
"thinking it's in
reduced form, and zero.",00:05:56.660,00:06:00.030
OK.,00:06:00.030,00:06:00.710
Fine.,00:06:00.710,00:06:01.810
"Then it asks oh, further,
it asks about this matrix.",00:06:01.810,00:06:10.390
"U, U, U, and zero.",00:06:10.390,00:06:15.720
"OK, what's the
echelon form of this?",00:06:15.720,00:06:18.190
"So it's just like
practice in thinking",00:06:18.190,00:06:20.050
"through what would
row elimination,",00:06:20.050,00:06:22.560
what would row reduction do.,00:06:22.560,00:06:25.790
"Have I thought this through,
so what -- what are we --",00:06:25.790,00:06:29.450
"if we start doing elimination,
basically we're going",00:06:29.450,00:06:31.920
"to subtract these
rows from these --",00:06:31.920,00:06:34.030
"In the column
space, because I do",00:06:34.030,00:06:36.080
"know that it can so it's going
to take us to U, U, zero,",00:06:36.080,00:06:40.190
"and minus U, For example, I'm
going to ask you for a I guess,",00:06:40.190,00:06:44.090
right?,00:06:44.090,00:06:44.590
"But is it a- is
it three by three?",00:06:44.590,00:06:47.240
"Take the thing all the way to R
-- let's suppose U is really R.",00:06:47.240,00:06:53.690
"Suppose that we're really going
for the reduced row echelon",00:06:53.690,00:06:56.660
"doing linear
algebra of course --",00:06:56.660,00:06:56.930
"but I didn't have
to do the form.",00:06:56.930,00:06:58.390
Then would we stop there?,00:06:58.390,00:07:01.090
No.,00:07:01.090,00:07:03.260
"We would clean out, we would
-- we could use this to --",00:07:03.260,00:07:07.740
"is that right, can I
so I took this row --",00:07:07.740,00:07:10.770
"these rows away from
these to get there.",00:07:10.770,00:07:13.540
"Now I take these rows away from
these, so that gives me zero.",00:07:13.540,00:07:16.885
"There. there?1 And now what
more would I do if I'm really",00:07:19.460,00:07:25.030
"shooting for R, the
reduced row echelon form?",00:07:25.030,00:07:29.460
"I would -- then I want
plus ones in the pivot,",00:07:29.460,00:07:33.200
"so I would multiply through by
minus one to get plus there.",00:07:33.200,00:07:37.750
"So essentially I'm seeing
reduced row echelon form",00:07:37.750,00:07:42.170
"there and there, and there's
just one little twist",00:07:42.170,00:07:46.180
still to go.,00:07:46.180,00:07:47.040
"Do you see what that
final twist might be?",00:07:47.040,00:07:51.324
It certainly has three rows.,00:07:51.324,00:07:52.490
"To have if -- if U is in
reduced row echelon form and now",00:07:52.490,00:07:57.790
"I'm looking at U, U, there's
one little step to take,",00:07:57.790,00:08:02.490
"this isn't like a big
deal at all, but --",00:08:02.490,00:08:05.090
"but if I really want this
to be in reduced form,",00:08:05.090,00:08:08.880
what would I still --,00:08:08.880,00:08:11.050
might I still have to do?,00:08:11.050,00:08:14.740
"I might have some
zero rows here,",00:08:14.740,00:08:17.750
"I might have some zero
rows here that strictly",00:08:17.750,00:08:20.720
should move to the bottom.,00:08:20.720,00:08:22.720
"Well, I'm not going to
make a project out of that.",00:08:22.720,00:08:26.079
first of all?,00:08:26.079,00:08:26.620
OK.,00:08:26.620,00:08:27.760
What's the rank of that matrix?,00:08:27.760,00:08:29.445
"What's the rank
of this matrix C?",00:08:32.510,00:08:37.250
"Given that I know that the
original U has rank three,",00:08:37.250,00:08:40.854
what's the rank of this guy?,00:08:40.854,00:08:42.020
"Six, right.",00:08:42.020,00:08:42.080
"That has rank six, I can tell.",00:08:42.080,00:08:42.289
"What was -- what's the
rank of this B, while --",00:08:42.289,00:08:43.030
"while we're at on TV for a
few weeks, did you see that,",00:08:43.030,00:08:43.159
it?,00:08:43.159,00:08:43.659
"The rank of B, is
that six or three?",00:08:43.659,00:08:56.690
So A is a three by three matrix.,00:08:56.690,00:08:58.200
Three is right.,00:08:58.200,00:08:59.300
Three is right.,00:08:59.300,00:08:59.940
"Because we actually got it to
where we could just see three",00:08:59.940,00:09:02.520
pivots.,00:09:02.520,00:09:03.330
"OK, and oh, now
finally this easy one,",00:09:03.330,00:09:08.230
"what's the dimension be solved
exactly when B is in the column",00:09:08.230,00:09:15.020
"space, of the null space --",00:09:15.020,00:09:18.410
"of the null space
of C transpose?",00:09:18.410,00:09:22.370
"Oh, boy.",00:09:22.370,00:09:22.980
"OK, so what do I -- if I want
the dimension of a null space,",00:09:22.980,00:09:27.260
"I want to know the
size of the matrix --",00:09:27.260,00:09:29.240
"so what's the size
of the matrix C?",00:09:29.240,00:09:32.450
"It looks like it's
ten by six, is it?",00:09:32.450,00:09:38.200
"Ten by six, so C is ten by six,
so m is ten, so C has ten rows,",00:09:38.200,00:09:49.280
"C transpose has ten columns,
so there are ten columns there.",00:09:49.280,00:09:54.190
"So how many free variables
have I got, once I --",00:09:54.190,00:09:57.950
"There's quite a few trues,
shall I take a poll,",00:09:57.950,00:10:00.950
"if I start with the ten
columns in C transpose,",00:10:00.950,00:10:03.950
that's the m for the original C.,00:10:03.950,00:10:06.050
And what do I subtract off?,00:10:06.050,00:10:07.640
Six.,00:10:07.640,00:10:08.140
"Because we said
that was the rank.",00:10:08.140,00:10:10.240
So I'm left with four.,00:10:10.240,00:10:11.540
Thanks.,00:10:11.540,00:10:12.040
OK.,00:10:12.040,00:10:12.540
"If b is in the -- and what
would -- what does the exam say",00:10:12.540,00:10:16.840
"So I think that's
the right answer --",00:10:16.840,00:10:19.080
"the dimension of the null space
of C transpose would be four.",00:10:19.080,00:10:23.580
Right.,00:10:23.580,00:10:24.870
OK.,00:10:24.870,00:10:25.870
Yeah.,00:10:25.870,00:10:27.570
OK.,00:10:27.570,00:10:28.650
"So that's one question, at
least it brought in some --",00:10:28.650,00:10:34.710
some of the dimension counts.,00:10:34.710,00:10:37.130
OK.,00:10:37.130,00:10:37.630
"Here's another type of question.
think about, what's the --",00:10:37.630,00:10:40.088
"what's the shape of the matrix,",00:10:40.088,00:10:44.520
"I give you an equation,
Ax equals two four two.",00:10:44.520,00:10:52.870
"And I give you the
complete solution.",00:10:52.870,00:10:54.590
And what's its rank?,00:10:54.590,00:10:57.992
But I don't give you the matrix.,00:10:57.992,00:10:59.325
"And another -- there's another
vector, zero, zero, one.",00:11:05.390,00:11:10.810
OK.,00:11:10.810,00:11:11.310
All right.,00:11:15.951,00:11:16.450
"My first question is what's
the dimension of the row space?",00:11:16.450,00:11:22.660
Of the matrix A?,00:11:22.660,00:11:24.160
"So the main thing that you
want to get from this question",00:11:24.160,00:11:31.890
"is that a question
could start this way.",00:11:31.890,00:11:36.130
"exam, don't just tell me.",00:11:36.130,00:11:38.770
Sort of backward way.,00:11:38.770,00:11:40.890
"so I guess I'm
asking you what is",00:11:40.890,00:11:45.130
"the column space for this
basis for the null space.",00:11:45.130,00:11:50.420
"By giving you the answer and
not telling you what the problem",00:11:50.420,00:11:56.770
"homework, so I was watching
it, so there were three --",00:11:56.770,00:12:02.590
the is.,00:12:02.590,00:12:03.650
"But we can get a
lot of information,",00:12:03.650,00:12:07.890

If the null space --,00:18:45.190,00:18:46.930
I have a square matrix.,00:18:46.930,00:18:49.400

"know about the null

Also the zero vector.,00:19:06.430,00:19:07.420
Good.,00:19:07.420,00:19:07.960
"And that's a very
very important fact.",00:19:07.960,00:19:10.270
OK.,00:19:10.270,00:19:11.630
How about this?,00:19:11.630,00:19:15.000
"These -- look at the space
of five by five matrices",00:19:15.000,00:19:20.450

space.,00:19:25.690,00:19:26.190
All five by five matrices.,00:19:26.190,00:19:28.990
Look at the invertible matrices.,00:19:28.990,00:19:31.770
Do they form a subspace?,00:19:31.770,00:19:35.430

"But now I narrow down
to the invertible ones.",00:19:44.180,00:19:48.110
And I ask are they a subspace?,00:19:48.110,00:19:50.700

"quiet, but nevertheless
definite, no.",00:19:54.600,00:19:57.418
Right?,00:20:00.130,00:20:00.800
"Because if I add two invertible
matrices I have no idea if the",00:20:00.800,00:20:04.040
No. answer is invertible.,00:20:04.040,00:20:06.570

"I have to be able to
multiply by zero --",00:20:13.630,00:20:16.020

wouldn't work either.",00:20:21.010,00:20:24.210

our particular solution?",00:32:49.020,00:32:54.790

"I-- actually the
first column of B,",00:33:00.090,00:33:05.360

Q: value.,00:34:10.280,00:34:10.780
OK.,00:34:10.780,00:34:11.300

particular x particular,",00:34:11.300,00:34:15.000

when I multiply by this guy,",00:34:15.000,00:34:22.330

first column of B.",00:34:22.330,00:34:26.850

solution, I multiply B,",00:34:26.850,00:34:30.050

the first column of B,",00:34:30.050,00:34:34.060

the right-hand side.,00:34:39.480,00:34:41.300

first column of that matrix B.",00:34:41.300,00:34:47.340
"If you do the
multiplication, it's --",00:34:47.340,00:34:50.780
"so what's the first
column of that matrix?",00:34:50.780,00:34:52.659

that multiplication?",00:34:52.659,00:34:54.370
"I multiply that matrix
by that first column.",00:34:54.370,00:34:56.203

of B is exactly that.",00:34:59.400,00:35:11.020

solution will be this guy.",00:35:11.020,00:35:18.650

that we pick out.,00:35:26.320,00:35:28.180

a question like that?",00:38:45.510,00:38:53.000
"Of course if you want to
answer it yes, then I would --",00:38:53.000,00:38:56.500
"then they'd have to
think of a reason why.",00:38:56.500,00:38:59.460
"If you want to answer no
way, then you would --",00:38:59.460,00:39:02.050
"and I would sort of like
first I would try to think no,",00:39:02.050,00:39:06.410
"I would say can I come up with
an example where it isn't true?",00:39:06.410,00:39:10.540
Let me repeat the question.,00:39:10.540,00:39:17.680
And then write the answer.,00:39:17.680,00:39:24.810
"matrix, then what --",00:39:24.810,00:39:30.520
"suppose it's six by
six invertible matrix,",00:39:30.520,00:39:40.510
"then what's its row space, and
its column space is all of R^6,",00:39:40.510,00:39:59.070
"and the null space, and the null
space of A transpose would be",00:39:59.070,00:40:17.620
the zero vector.,00:40:17.620,00:40:21.900
"So every invertible matrix
is going to give that answer.",00:40:21.900,00:40:36.170
"If I have a six by
six invertible matrix,",00:40:36.170,00:40:49.020
I know what those subspaces are.,00:40:49.020,00:40:51.602
"Heck, that was back
in chapter two,",00:40:51.602,00:40:53.060
"when I didn't even know
what subspaces were.",00:40:53.060,00:40:55.720
"The row space and column space
are both all six-dimensional",00:40:55.720,00:41:01.890
"space -- the whole space,
and the rank is six,",00:41:01.890,00:41:05.470
"in other words, and the null
spaces have zero dimension.",00:41:05.470,00:41:10.280
So do you see now the answer?,00:41:10.280,00:41:11.870
So A and B could be.,00:41:11.870,00:41:13.060
"So A and B could be for example
any -- so I'm going to say",00:41:13.060,00:41:16.970
false.,00:41:16.970,00:41:17.470
Because A and B for example --,00:41:17.470,00:41:21.070
"So an example: A and B any
invertible six by six, six",00:41:21.070,00:41:34.230
by six.,00:41:34.230,00:41:34.730
"So those would have
the same four subspaces",00:41:34.730,00:41:39.230
but they wouldn't be the same.,00:41:39.230,00:41:40.480
"Of course th- there should be
something about those matrices",00:41:40.480,00:41:44.890
that would be the same.,00:41:44.890,00:41:45.930
"It's sort of a natural
problem, so now actually we're",00:41:45.930,00:41:50.070
getting to a math question.,00:41:50.070,00:41:52.120
The answer is this is not true.,00:41:52.120,00:41:54.390
"One matrix doesn't have to
be a multiple of the other.",00:41:54.390,00:41:59.300
"But there must be
something that's true.",00:41:59.300,00:42:02.420
"And that would be sort of like
a natural question to ask.",00:42:02.420,00:42:07.770
"If they have the same
subspaces, same four subspaces,",00:42:07.770,00:42:15.850
then what -- what could you --,00:42:15.850,00:42:29.700
"instinct wasn't
necessarily right.",00:42:29.700,00:42:32.480
"But I hope you now see that
the correct answer is false.",00:42:32.480,00:42:37.700
"And then you might think
OK, well, they certainly",00:42:37.700,00:42:40.550
do have the same rank.,00:42:40.550,00:42:43.530
"But do -- obviously if they
have the same four subspaces,",00:42:43.530,00:42:51.860
they have the same rank.,00:42:51.860,00:42:54.460
"I might say if
they have the well,",00:42:54.460,00:42:58.620
"I could extend that question and
think about other possibilities",00:42:58.620,00:43:03.820
"and finally come up with
something that was true.",00:43:03.820,00:43:08.500
But I won't press that one.,00:43:08.500,00:43:11.620
"Let me keep going with
practice questions.",00:43:11.620,00:43:15.270
"And these practice questions
are quite appropriate I",00:43:15.270,00:43:19.430
think for the exam.,00:43:19.430,00:43:21.510
OK.,00:43:21.510,00:43:22.030
let's see.,00:43:22.030,00:43:23.070
"If I exchange two rows of A
which subspaces stay the same?",00:43:23.070,00:43:29.310
"So I'm trying to
take out questions",00:43:29.310,00:43:32.950
"that we can answer without you
know we can answer quickly.",00:43:32.950,00:43:38.670
"If I have a matrix A, and I
exchange two of its rows, which",00:43:38.670,00:43:45.560
subspaces stay the same?,00:43:45.560,00:43:47.570
"The row space does
stay the same.",00:43:47.570,00:43:50.560
"And the null space
stays the same.",00:43:50.560,00:43:53.440
Good.,00:43:53.440,00:43:54.270
Good.,00:43:54.270,00:43:55.200
Correct.,00:43:55.200,00:43:56.690
"Column space would
be a wrong answer.",00:43:56.690,00:43:59.170
OK.,00:43:59.170,00:44:00.280
"all right, here's a question.",00:44:00.280,00:44:03.140
"Oh, this leads into
the next chapter.",00:44:03.140,00:44:05.730
"Why can the vector
one, two, three not",00:44:05.730,00:44:08.990
"be a row and also
in the null space?",00:44:08.990,00:44:12.280
"Fitting we close
with this question.",00:44:12.280,00:44:15.040
"Close is -- so V
equal this one, two,",00:44:15.040,00:44:19.860
"three can't be in the null space
of a matrix and the row space.",00:44:19.860,00:44:33.900
And my question is why not?,00:44:33.900,00:44:40.690
Why not?,00:44:40.690,00:44:41.378
"So this is a
question that we can",00:44:45.030,00:44:47.950
"because it's sort of asked
in a straightforward way,",00:44:47.950,00:44:51.360
we can figure out an answer.,00:44:51.360,00:44:55.410
"Well, actually yeah --",00:44:55.410,00:44:57.460
"I'll even pin it down, it
can't be in the null space --",00:44:57.460,00:45:00.550
and be a row.,00:45:00.550,00:45:04.420
I'll even pin it down further.,00:45:04.420,00:45:07.050
Ask it to be a row of A.,00:45:07.050,00:45:12.550
Why not?,00:45:12.550,00:45:15.000
"So I'm -- we know the
dimensions of these spaces.",00:45:15.000,00:45:18.820
"But now I'm asking you sort
of like the overlap between --",00:45:18.820,00:45:26.330
"so the null space
and the row space,",00:45:26.330,00:45:30.320
"those are in the same
n-dimensional space.",00:45:30.320,00:45:33.210
"Those are -- well, those are
both subspaces of n-dimensional",00:45:33.210,00:45:41.410
"space, and I'm basically
saying they can't overlap.",00:45:41.410,00:45:45.060
"I can't have a vector like
this, a typical vector, that's",00:45:45.060,00:45:49.040
"in the null space and it's
also a row of the matrix.",00:45:49.040,00:45:53.110
Why is that?,00:45:53.110,00:45:54.580
So that's a new sort of idea.,00:45:54.580,00:45:56.350
"Let's just see
what it would mean.",00:45:56.350,00:45:58.320
"I mean that A times this V,
why can this A times this",00:45:58.320,00:46:04.860
V it can't be zero.,00:46:04.860,00:46:07.770
"Oh well, if it's
zero, so this is --",00:46:07.770,00:46:12.410
"I'm getting it into
the null space here.",00:46:12.410,00:46:16.830
"So this is -- now let's put
that vector's in the null space,",00:46:16.830,00:46:20.750
"why can't the first row of
a matrix be one, two, three?",00:46:20.750,00:46:27.600
"I can fill out the
matrix as I like.",00:46:27.600,00:46:35.470
Why is that impossible?,00:46:35.470,00:46:37.010
"Well, you're seeing
it's impossible, right?",00:46:37.010,00:46:39.310
"That if that was a row of the
matrix and in the null space,",00:46:39.310,00:46:44.690
"that number would not be
zero, it would be fourteen.",00:46:44.690,00:46:48.421
Right.,00:46:48.421,00:46:48.920
"So now we actually are beginning
to get a more complete picture",00:46:48.920,00:46:52.960
of these four subspaces.,00:46:52.960,00:46:55.170
"The two that are over
in n-dimensional space,",00:46:55.170,00:47:00.220
"they actually only
share the zero vector.",00:47:00.220,00:47:04.450
"The intersection of the
null space and the row space",00:47:04.450,00:47:08.110
is only the zero vector.,00:47:08.110,00:47:09.310
"And in fact the null space is
perpendicular to the row space.",00:47:09.310,00:47:14.970
"That'll be the first
topic let's see,",00:47:14.970,00:47:18.920
we have a holiday Monday --,00:47:18.920,00:47:23.940
"and I'll see you Wednesday
with perpendiculars.",00:47:23.940,00:47:29.800
And I'll see you Friday.,00:47:29.800,00:47:33.980
So good luck on the quiz.,00:47:33.980,00:47:39.710
