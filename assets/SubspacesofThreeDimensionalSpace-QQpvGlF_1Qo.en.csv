"PROFESSOR: Hi, welcome
back to recitation.",00:00:06.860,00:00:09.560
"In the lecture, we've learned
very important concepts--",00:00:09.560,00:00:13.490
"linear space and
linear subspace.",00:00:13.490,00:00:16.620
"Well, as you can imagine, if
we call something a space,",00:00:16.620,00:00:20.200
"we're putting a lot of things,
a lot of objects into one set.",00:00:20.200,00:00:24.670
"But for linear space, we
want to put them in according",00:00:24.670,00:00:28.400
to a particular manner.,00:00:28.400,00:00:30.680
"So can you recall what are
the conditions for a set",00:00:30.680,00:00:33.890
to be a linear space?,00:00:33.890,00:00:36.280
"You take any two elements from
that set, take the sum of them.",00:00:36.280,00:00:40.490
"You want the sum to be
still in the same set.",00:00:40.490,00:00:43.400
That's the first condition.,00:00:43.400,00:00:45.370
"Second, you take any multiple
of any element from that set,",00:00:45.370,00:00:50.010
"the result will
still be in that set.",00:00:50.010,00:00:53.190
That's the second condition.,00:00:53.190,00:00:56.140
"And if, within a
linear space, you",00:00:56.140,00:00:58.970
"can find a subset which also
satisfies the two conditions,",00:00:58.970,00:01:03.510
that will give you a subspace.,00:01:03.510,00:01:06.560
"Today, we're going to
look at this example",00:01:06.560,00:01:09.620
"to review these two important
properties of linear space",00:01:09.620,00:01:13.880
and subspace.,00:01:13.880,00:01:16.870
"I have two vectors, x_1 and x_2.",00:01:16.870,00:01:20.980
Both of them are vectors in R^3.,00:01:20.980,00:01:23.480
"So, as you can see,
I've drawn them here.",00:01:23.480,00:01:26.910
"This is x_1, and this is x_2.",00:01:26.910,00:01:30.750
"So first, we want to find the
subspace generated by x_1.",00:01:30.750,00:01:36.740
I call it V_1.,00:01:36.740,00:01:38.820
"Let me say a word about
this ""generated by.""",00:01:38.820,00:01:43.430
"So what do I mean by a
subspace generated by x_1?",00:01:43.430,00:01:48.190
"I'm looking for the smallest
subspace that contains x_1, as",00:01:48.190,00:01:53.200
small as you can get.,00:01:53.200,00:01:55.470
"Similarly, I want to find out
the subspace generated by x_2,",00:01:55.470,00:02:00.690
call it V_2.,00:02:00.690,00:02:03.520
"Then we want to say something
about the intersection of V_1",00:02:03.520,00:02:07.830
and V_2.,00:02:07.830,00:02:09.240
That's the first question.,00:02:09.240,00:02:11.080
"And the second question, we
want to put vector x_1 and x_2",00:02:11.080,00:02:16.570
"together and look at the
subspace generated by x_1",00:02:16.570,00:02:21.040
and x_2 at the same time.,00:02:21.040,00:02:22.890
So I call it V_3.,00:02:22.890,00:02:25.950
"And a good question
to be asked here",00:02:25.950,00:02:28.400
"is: what is the relation
of v3 to V_1 union V_2?",00:02:28.400,00:02:34.820
Do you think they're equal?,00:02:34.820,00:02:37.830
"Within the second
question, I would also",00:02:37.830,00:02:40.320
"like you to find a subspace,
call it S, of V_3 such",00:02:40.320,00:02:45.850
"that neither x_1
nor x_2 is in s.",00:02:45.850,00:02:51.730
"And the last
question is I'd like",00:02:51.730,00:02:54.330
"you to say something about
the intersection of V_3",00:02:54.330,00:02:58.030
with the xy-plane.,00:02:58.030,00:03:00.380
"So notice that, of course,
xy-plane is also a subspace",00:03:00.380,00:03:04.850
of R^3.,00:03:04.850,00:03:06.170
"So again, I'm looking at the
intersection of two subspaces.",00:03:06.170,00:03:11.740
"All right, why don't
you hit the pause now,",00:03:11.740,00:03:14.170
"and try to solve these
three problems on your own.",00:03:14.170,00:03:17.860
"And I'd like you to identify
your answers in this picture",00:03:17.860,00:03:23.040
whenever you can.,00:03:23.040,00:03:24.980
"I'll come back later and
continue working with you.",00:03:24.980,00:03:27.740
"OK, how did your drawing go?",00:03:36.620,00:03:39.280
Let's look at this together.,00:03:39.280,00:03:41.350
"First, we want to find
subspace generated by x_1.",00:03:41.350,00:03:45.660
So here is x_1.,00:03:45.660,00:03:47.520
"Let's keep in mind
the two conditions",00:03:47.520,00:03:50.100
that a subspace has to satisfy.,00:03:50.100,00:03:52.710
"Well, if I want to
obtain the subspace,",00:03:52.710,00:03:57.080
"at least I have to be able
to take any multiple of x_1,",00:03:57.080,00:04:01.210
right?,00:04:01.210,00:04:01.880
"So that means at least I have to
include the straight line that",00:04:01.880,00:04:07.320
contains x_1.,00:04:07.320,00:04:09.000
"So I'm going to try to draw
the straight line here.",00:04:09.000,00:04:13.340
"So I'm just simply going
to extend this x1 along",00:04:13.340,00:04:17.430
to both directions.,00:04:17.430,00:04:19.384
"So x_1, I will try very
hard to make it straight.",00:04:19.384,00:04:32.520
"But to be honest, it's
really hard for me",00:04:32.520,00:04:35.400
"to draw straight
lines on the board.",00:04:35.400,00:04:39.020
Is that straight?,00:04:39.020,00:04:40.315
Seems fine.,00:04:40.315,00:04:41.990
"All right, so this
entire line contains x_1.",00:04:41.990,00:04:46.690
"So at least this line
has to be in V_1.",00:04:46.690,00:04:50.982
"Is there anything
else beyond this line?",00:04:50.982,00:04:55.000
"Now let's turn to
the second condition.",00:04:55.000,00:04:57.920
"The second condition
says that we",00:04:57.920,00:04:59.990
"have to be able to take any
two elements, take the sum,",00:04:59.990,00:05:04.110
"and the sum will
remain in that set.",00:05:04.110,00:05:06.500
Does it work for this line?,00:05:06.500,00:05:08.440
"You take any two
vectors on this line,",00:05:08.440,00:05:12.030
"or you can say any two
points on this line,",00:05:12.030,00:05:14.940
"and then you take
to sum of them.",00:05:14.940,00:05:17.140
"Of course, you still get
something on this line.",00:05:17.140,00:05:20.450
"You won't be able
to escape from it.",00:05:20.450,00:05:23.340
"Which means this line
is a perfect set that",00:05:23.340,00:05:26.910
satisfies the two conditions.,00:05:26.910,00:05:29.220
"So this line simply
gives me V_1.",00:05:29.220,00:05:33.880
"That is the smallest
subspace that contains x_1.",00:05:33.880,00:05:37.010
"So in other words, the subspace
generated by x_1 is V_1.",00:05:37.010,00:05:42.580
"So similarly, let's look at x_2.",00:05:42.580,00:05:45.560
"What is the subspace
generated by x_2?",00:05:45.560,00:05:48.700
"Again, you get the
entire straight line",00:05:48.700,00:05:51.030
that contains x_2.,00:05:51.030,00:05:53.050
"So I'm going to extend
x_2 in both directions.",00:05:53.050,00:05:57.445
I hope it's straight.,00:06:08.530,00:06:09.490
Not too bad.,00:06:12.480,00:06:14.650
That will give me V_2.,00:06:14.650,00:06:16.810
"All right, V_1, V_2.",00:06:16.810,00:06:19.840
"Both of them are
subspaces of R^3.",00:06:19.840,00:06:23.890
"Now let's look at the
intersection of V_1 and V_2.",00:06:23.890,00:06:27.630
"So we know that both of
them are straight lines.",00:06:27.630,00:06:31.280
"And clearly they're
not parallel,",00:06:31.280,00:06:33.690
"because x_1 and x_2
are not parallel.",00:06:33.690,00:06:36.770
"So what is the intersection
of V_1 and V_2?",00:06:36.770,00:06:40.650
"The intersection of V_1
and V_2 is the only point",00:06:40.650,00:06:47.520
at which they cross.,00:06:47.520,00:06:49.110
And where's that point?,00:06:49.110,00:06:51.490
"It's here, right at the origin.",00:06:51.490,00:06:53.280
"Because both of them
pass the origin.",00:06:53.280,00:06:56.420
I'm going to use O to denote.,00:06:56.420,00:06:59.690
"That's the intersection
of V_1 and V_2.",00:06:59.690,00:07:03.360
"This is a set with
only one element.",00:07:03.360,00:07:07.120
What can you say about this set?,00:07:07.120,00:07:10.250
"I claim this is also
a subspace of R^3.",00:07:10.250,00:07:15.330
"By saying space, we usually
mean a lot of objects together.",00:07:15.330,00:07:20.210
But look at this set.,00:07:20.210,00:07:22.110
"This set fits perfectly
into the conditions",00:07:22.110,00:07:24.580
of being a linear space.,00:07:24.580,00:07:27.040
"You take any multiple of 0,
again you get 0-- 0 plus 0,",00:07:27.040,00:07:33.260
you get 0.,00:07:33.260,00:07:34.470
"So that's a perfectly
fine subspace of R^3.",00:07:34.470,00:07:38.840
"All right, so what
we have got here is:",00:07:38.840,00:07:41.340
"I take the intersection
of V_1 and V_2,",00:07:41.340,00:07:44.940
"and the result, again,
becomes a subspace,",00:07:44.940,00:07:48.510
which only contains the origin.,00:07:48.510,00:07:51.230
"That completes the
first question.",00:07:51.230,00:07:53.640
Let's look at the second one.,00:07:53.640,00:07:56.210
"In the second question, I want
to put x_1 and x_2 together,",00:07:56.210,00:08:00.980
"and look at the subspace
generated by x_1 and x_2.",00:08:00.980,00:08:05.860
"And I would also like
you to say something",00:08:05.860,00:08:08.790
"about the relation
between V_1 union V_2",00:08:08.790,00:08:13.140
"to the subspace
generated by x_1, x_2.",00:08:13.140,00:08:17.210
"Let's try to answer the
second question first.",00:08:17.210,00:08:20.980
"Is there a chance that
V_1 union V_2 equal to v3?",00:08:20.980,00:08:26.100
"OK, so what is V_1 union V_2?",00:08:26.100,00:08:29.220
"That's clearly just
two lines, right?",00:08:29.220,00:08:31.700
This line union this line.,00:08:31.700,00:08:35.360
"Is there a chance that this
union will be a subspace?",00:08:35.360,00:08:39.710
Let's check the two conditions.,00:08:39.710,00:08:41.830
"First, you take any multiple
of the elements in this union.",00:08:41.830,00:08:47.260
"It's either on this
line or on this line.",00:08:47.260,00:08:52.210
"Seems that the multiple is still
going to stay inside the union.",00:08:52.210,00:08:56.080
"So the first condition
is actually satisfied.",00:08:56.080,00:08:58.596
What about the second one?,00:08:58.596,00:09:00.700
"The second one says
that I have to be",00:09:00.700,00:09:02.760
"able to take any sum, the
sum of any two elements,",00:09:02.760,00:09:07.280
from these two lines.,00:09:07.280,00:09:09.240
"Let's just try a simple
sum, x_1 plus x_2.",00:09:09.240,00:09:12.610
So what is x_1 plus x_2?,00:09:12.610,00:09:14.210
You just sum up each coordinate.,00:09:18.570,00:09:20.710
"That will give you [2, 5, 3].",00:09:20.710,00:09:26.370
"In this picture-- can I
draw it in this picture?",00:09:29.500,00:09:32.880
It's going to be somewhere here.,00:09:32.880,00:09:41.045
That's x_1 plus x_3.,00:09:50.280,00:09:54.824
Did you notice something?,00:09:54.824,00:09:57.560
"You clearly have got
out of this union.",00:09:57.560,00:10:02.530
"So this sum is not
inside V_1 union V_2.",00:10:02.530,00:10:11.230
"Which means V_1 union
V-2 is not a subspace.",00:10:11.230,00:10:15.730
"Then it's impossible that
this union will equal to V_3.",00:10:15.730,00:10:20.830
"So the answer to
the second question",00:10:20.830,00:10:24.640
"is no, V_3 is not
equal to V_1 union V_2.",00:10:24.640,00:10:29.020
Now let's identify V_3.,00:10:29.020,00:10:31.540
"Well, as you can see, since we
have seen from this argument",00:10:31.540,00:10:35.340
"that we have to
be able to include",00:10:35.340,00:10:38.650
this diagonal vector here.,00:10:38.650,00:10:40.490
"But in fact, as you can see
since we can take any elements",00:10:40.490,00:10:44.170
"from these two
lines, we're actually",00:10:44.170,00:10:46.400
"including every vector on the
plane spanned by V_1 and V_2.",00:10:46.400,00:10:53.680
"So in other words, I'm actually
looking at this huge plane",00:10:53.680,00:11:01.460
that is spanned by V_1 and V_2.,00:11:01.460,00:11:06.690
That will give me V_3.,00:11:06.690,00:11:08.520
So that's reasonable.,00:11:12.600,00:11:14.300
"I'm looking at the subspace
generated by two lines in R^3.",00:11:14.300,00:11:18.380
"And that two line will be
able to span a plane in R^3.",00:11:18.380,00:11:23.780
"Now for the last
part of question two,",00:11:23.780,00:11:27.780
"I want to find a
subspace S of V_3--",00:11:27.780,00:11:30.710
"so I want to find a
subspace of this plane--",00:11:30.710,00:11:33.210
"such that x_1 is not S,
x_2 is not in S either.",00:11:33.210,00:11:38.460
"So I want to stay away from
this line and this line.",00:11:38.460,00:11:43.530
"Can you find such
a subspace of V_3?",00:11:43.530,00:11:47.880
It's right here.,00:11:47.880,00:11:50.470
"Because if you look at this
vector, x_1 plus x_2-- sorry,",00:11:50.470,00:11:55.280
that should be x_2.,00:11:55.280,00:11:56.300
"If you look at this
vector, and if you",00:12:00.240,00:12:02.960
"look at the subspace
generated by this vector,",00:12:02.960,00:12:06.520
"again you know it's
going to be a line.",00:12:06.520,00:12:08.990
And this line is right here.,00:12:08.990,00:12:10.390
"This line forms a
perfect subspace of V_3.",00:12:18.790,00:12:22.840
"But neither x_1 nor x_2
is inside this subspace.",00:12:22.840,00:12:27.960
"So let's just make it S. Of
course, the choice is not",00:12:27.960,00:12:33.640
unique.,00:12:33.640,00:12:34.480
"You can take twice x_1 plus
x_2 or x_1 plus twice x_2.",00:12:34.480,00:12:40.280
"OK, we have completed
the second problem.",00:12:40.280,00:12:44.350
"The last problems ask us to
find the intersection of V_3",00:12:44.350,00:12:49.380
with xy-plane.,00:12:49.380,00:12:51.430
"Well, just think about that.",00:12:51.430,00:12:52.930
"We've identified
V_3 as this plane",00:12:52.930,00:12:56.350
spanned by line V_1 and V_2.,00:12:56.350,00:12:59.500
And xy is also a plane.,00:12:59.500,00:13:02.150
"So we're talking about the
intersection of two planes",00:13:02.150,00:13:05.290
in R^3.,00:13:05.290,00:13:06.830
What would that be?,00:13:06.830,00:13:08.660
"So you have two
planes intersect.",00:13:08.660,00:13:11.590
"The intersection will be a
straight line again, right?",00:13:11.590,00:13:15.120
"So let's locate
that straight line.",00:13:15.120,00:13:18.080
"We want to find something that
is inside V_3 and xy-plane",00:13:18.080,00:13:23.050
at the same time.,00:13:23.050,00:13:23.850
"What can you say about
the points in xy-plane?",00:13:26.480,00:13:30.380
The z-coordinate has to be 0.,00:13:30.380,00:13:33.880
"And at the same time, we know
that at least x_1 and x_2",00:13:33.880,00:13:38.720
are in V_3.,00:13:38.720,00:13:40.290
So did you notice that?,00:13:40.290,00:13:43.130
"x_2 is a vector
that lies in V_3.",00:13:43.130,00:13:47.760
"But at the same time, the
z-coordinate of x_2 is 0.",00:13:47.760,00:13:52.830
That is what we're looking for.,00:13:52.830,00:13:55.160
"So the intersection
of V_3 with xy-plane",00:13:55.160,00:14:09.550
"will simply be the
line that contains x_2.",00:14:09.550,00:14:15.090
"And here we've
identified that as V_2.",00:14:15.090,00:14:20.820
That's it.,00:14:20.820,00:14:22.340
This is a subspace of R^3.,00:14:22.340,00:14:24.610
And this is the subspace of R^3.,00:14:24.610,00:14:26.580
"The intersection is
again a subspace of R^3.",00:14:26.580,00:14:32.740
"I hope you've learned a
way to somehow visualize",00:14:32.740,00:14:36.590
"this linear space and subspace
through this exercise.",00:14:36.590,00:14:41.380
"Thank you for watching,
and I'll see you next time.",00:14:41.380,00:14:44.407
