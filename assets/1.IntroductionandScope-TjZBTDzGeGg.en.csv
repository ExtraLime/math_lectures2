"PATRICK WINSTON: Welcome
to 6034.",00:00:18.200,00:00:26.190
"I don't know if I can deal
with this microphone.",00:00:26.190,00:00:28.230
We'll see what happens.,00:00:28.230,00:00:29.405
It's going to be a good year.,00:00:29.405,00:00:30.380
"We've got [INAUDIBLE] a bunch
of interesting people.",00:00:30.380,00:00:33.530
"It's always interesting to see
what people named their",00:00:33.530,00:00:35.790
children two decades ago.,00:00:35.790,00:00:39.820
"And I find they were overwhelmed
with Emilys.",00:00:39.820,00:00:42.510
"And there are not too many
Peters, Pauls, and Marys, but",00:00:42.510,00:00:45.420
"enough to call forth a suitable
song at some point.",00:00:45.420,00:00:50.540
"We have lots of Jesses
of both genders.",00:00:50.540,00:00:55.630
We have a [INAUDIBLE],00:00:55.630,00:00:57.220
of both genders.,00:00:57.220,00:00:59.890
"And we have a Duncan,
where's Duncan?",00:00:59.890,00:01:02.810
"There you are, Duncan.",00:01:02.810,00:01:04.080
You've changed your hairstyle.,00:01:04.080,00:01:06.900
"I want to assure use that the
Thane of Cawdor is not taking",00:01:06.900,00:01:10.130
the course this semester.,00:01:10.130,00:01:12.390
"What I'm going to do is tell
you about artificial",00:01:12.390,00:01:14.890
"intelligence today, and what
this subject is about.",00:01:14.890,00:01:18.680
"There's been about a 10% percent
turnover in the roster",00:01:18.680,00:01:24.100
in the last 24 hours.,00:01:24.100,00:01:25.320
"I expect another 10% turnover
in the next 24 hours, too.",00:01:25.320,00:01:29.680
"So I know many of you are
sightseers, wanting to know if",00:01:29.680,00:01:32.600
"this is something
you want to do.",00:01:32.600,00:01:33.720
"So I'm going to tell you about
what we're going to do this",00:01:33.720,00:01:36.140
"semester, and what you'll know
when you get out of here.",00:01:36.140,00:01:40.229
"I'm going to walk you through
this outline.",00:01:40.229,00:01:43.620
"I'm going to start by talking
about what artificial",00:01:43.620,00:01:45.539
"intelligence is, and
why we do it.",00:01:45.539,00:01:48.630
"And then I'll give you a little
bit of the history of",00:01:48.630,00:01:50.160
"artificial intelligence, and
conclude with some of the",00:01:50.160,00:01:54.000
"covenants by which we
run the course.",00:01:54.000,00:01:56.570
"One of which is no
laptops, please.",00:01:56.570,00:01:58.140
"I'll explain why we have these
covenants at the end.",00:02:00.900,00:02:05.620
So what is it?,00:02:05.620,00:02:07.360
"Well, it must have something
to do with thinking.",00:02:07.360,00:02:12.220
"So let's start up here, a
definition of artificial",00:02:12.220,00:02:15.280
"intelligence, by saying that
it's about thinking,",00:02:15.280,00:02:21.820
whatever that is.,00:02:21.820,00:02:23.850
"My definition of artificial
intelligence has",00:02:23.850,00:02:26.100
to be rather broad.,00:02:26.100,00:02:28.560
"So we're going to say it's
not only about thinking.",00:02:28.560,00:02:31.710
"It's also about perception,
and it's about action.",00:02:31.710,00:02:39.110
"And if this were a philosophy
class, then I'd stop right",00:02:42.610,00:02:46.060
"there and just say, in this
subject we're going to talk",00:02:46.060,00:02:49.120
"about problems involving
thinking,",00:02:49.120,00:02:52.370
"perception, and action.",00:02:52.370,00:02:54.860
"But this is not a philosophy
class.",00:02:54.860,00:02:57.890
This a Course six class.,00:02:57.890,00:02:59.050
"It's an engineering
school class.",00:02:59.050,00:03:00.350
It's an MIT class.,00:03:00.350,00:03:02.000
So we need more than that.,00:03:02.000,00:03:03.940
"And therefore we're going to
talk about models that are",00:03:03.940,00:03:12.380
"targeted at thinking,
perception, and action.",00:03:12.380,00:03:20.329
"And this should not be strange
to you, because model making",00:03:20.329,00:03:23.800
is what MIT is about.,00:03:23.800,00:03:26.900
"You run into someone at a bar,
or relative asks you what you",00:03:26.900,00:03:29.540
"do at MIT, the right knee jerk
reaction is to say, we learned",00:03:29.540,00:03:33.200
how to build models.,00:03:33.200,00:03:35.130
That's what we do at MIT.,00:03:35.130,00:03:36.990
"We build the models using
differential equations.",00:03:36.990,00:03:40.570
"We build models using
probabilities.",00:03:40.570,00:03:43.450
"We build models using physical
and computational simulations.",00:03:43.450,00:03:47.829
"Whatever we do, we
build models.",00:03:47.829,00:03:50.300
"Even in humanities class, MIT
approach is to make models",00:03:50.300,00:03:55.710
"that we can use to explain the
past, predict the future,",00:03:55.710,00:04:00.290
"understand the subject,
and control the world.",00:04:00.290,00:04:03.050
That's what MIT is about.,00:04:03.050,00:04:04.290
"And that's what this subject
is about, too.",00:04:04.290,00:04:06.400
"And now, our models are
models of thinking.",00:04:06.400,00:04:10.650
"So you might say,
if I take this",00:04:10.650,00:04:12.060
classic will I get smarter?,00:04:12.060,00:04:13.840
And the answer is yes.,00:04:13.840,00:04:14.760
You will get smarter.,00:04:14.760,00:04:15.500
"Because you'll have better
models of your own thinking,",00:04:15.500,00:04:17.980
"not just the subject matter of
the subject, but better models",00:04:17.980,00:04:21.120
of your own thinking.,00:04:21.120,00:04:23.840
"So models targeted at thinking,",00:04:23.840,00:04:25.370
"perception, and action.",00:04:25.370,00:04:27.670
"We know that's not quite enough,
because in order to",00:04:27.670,00:04:29.460
"have a model, you have to
have representation.",00:04:29.460,00:04:33.790
"So let's say that artificial
intelligence is about",00:04:33.790,00:04:37.040
"representations that support
the making of models to",00:04:37.040,00:04:52.470
"facilitate an understanding
of thinking,",00:04:52.470,00:04:55.040
"perception, and action.",00:04:55.040,00:04:57.500
"Now you might say to me, well
what's a representation?",00:04:57.500,00:04:59.409
And what good can it do?,00:04:59.409,00:05:00.170
"So I'd like to take a brief
moment to tell you about",00:05:00.170,00:05:02.780
gyroscopes.,00:05:02.780,00:05:03.540
"Many of you have friends in
mechanical engineering.",00:05:03.540,00:05:06.380
"One of the best ways embarrass
them is to say here's a",00:05:06.380,00:05:10.980
bicycle wheel.,00:05:10.980,00:05:12.210
"And if I spin it, and blow hard
on it right here, on the",00:05:12.210,00:05:16.720
"edge of the wheel, is
going to turn over",00:05:16.720,00:05:19.110
this way or this way?,00:05:19.110,00:05:23.160
"I guarantee that what they will
do is they'll put their",00:05:23.160,00:05:26.250
"hand in an arthritic posture
called the right hand screw",00:05:26.250,00:05:29.400
"rule, aptly named because people
who use it tend to get",00:05:29.400,00:05:35.870
"the right answer about
50% of the time.",00:05:35.870,00:05:41.460
"But we're never going to make
that mistake again.",00:05:41.460,00:05:44.560
"Because we're electrical
engineers,",00:05:44.560,00:05:45.780
not mechanical engineers.,00:05:45.780,00:05:46.820
"And we know about
representation.",00:05:46.820,00:05:49.300
"What we're going to do is we're
going to think about it",00:05:49.300,00:05:51.290
a little bit.,00:05:51.290,00:05:52.486
"And we're going to use some
duct tape to help us think",00:05:52.486,00:05:54.780
"about just one piece
of the wheel.",00:05:54.780,00:05:57.730
"So I want you to just think
about that piece of the wheel",00:05:57.730,00:06:01.270
"as the wheel comes flying
over the top, and I",00:06:01.270,00:06:03.050
blow on it like that.,00:06:03.050,00:06:04.810
"What's going to happen
to that one piece?",00:06:04.810,00:06:08.090
"It's going to go off
that way, right?",00:06:08.090,00:06:10.520
"And the next piece is going
to go off that way too.",00:06:10.520,00:06:13.400
"So when it comes over, it
has to go that way.",00:06:13.400,00:06:17.610
"Let me do some ground f
here just to be sure.",00:06:17.610,00:06:19.440
It's very powerful feeling.,00:06:22.200,00:06:23.450
Try it.,00:06:26.760,00:06:28.730
We need a demonstration.,00:06:28.730,00:06:29.540
"I don't anybody think that
I'm cheating, here.",00:06:29.540,00:06:33.010
"So let's just twist it
one way or the other.",00:06:33.010,00:06:39.840
"So that's powerful
pull, isn't it.",00:06:39.840,00:06:42.100
"Alex is now never going to get
the gyroscope wrong, because",00:06:42.100,00:06:46.820
"he's got the right
representation.",00:06:46.820,00:06:49.870
"So much of what you're going to
accumulate in this subject",00:06:49.870,00:06:52.130
"is a suite of representations
that will help you to build",00:06:52.130,00:06:54.560
programs that are intelligent.,00:06:54.560,00:06:56.990
"But I want to give you a second
example, one a little",00:06:56.990,00:07:00.330
bit more computational.,00:07:00.330,00:07:01.300
"But one of which was very
familiar to you by the time",00:07:01.300,00:07:03.990
"you went to first grade,
in most cases.",00:07:03.990,00:07:06.690
"It's the problem of the farmer,
the fox, the goose,",00:07:06.690,00:07:09.610
and the grain.,00:07:09.610,00:07:11.020
"There's a river, a leaky rowboat
that can only carry",00:07:11.020,00:07:14.070
"the farmer, and one of
his four possessions.",00:07:14.070,00:07:17.340
So what's the right,00:07:17.340,00:07:18.080
representation for this problem?,00:07:18.080,00:07:21.220
"It might be a picture
of the farmer.",00:07:21.220,00:07:24.370
"It might be a poem about the
situation, perhaps a haiku.",00:07:24.370,00:07:29.570
"We know that those are not
the right representation.",00:07:29.570,00:07:33.240
"Somehow, we get the sense that
the right representation most",00:07:33.240,00:07:38.340
"involve something about the
location of the participants",00:07:38.340,00:07:42.440
in this scenario.,00:07:42.440,00:07:44.270
"So we might draw a picture
that looks like this.",00:07:44.270,00:07:48.480
"There's the scenario, and
here in glorious green,",00:07:48.480,00:07:54.150
"representing our algae infested
rivers is the river.",00:07:54.150,00:07:58.450
"And here's the farmer, the fox,
the goose, and the grain.",00:07:58.450,00:08:05.306
An initial situation.,00:08:05.306,00:08:07.900
"Now there are other situations
like this one, for example.",00:08:07.900,00:08:10.743
"We have the river, and
the farmer, and the",00:08:13.360,00:08:19.200
goose is on that side.,00:08:19.200,00:08:21.590
"And the fox and the grain
is on that side.",00:08:21.590,00:08:26.160
"And we know that the farmer can
execute a movement from",00:08:26.160,00:08:31.520
one situation to another.,00:08:31.520,00:08:34.929
"So now we're getting somewhere
where with the problem.",00:08:34.929,00:08:36.980
"This is at MIT approach
to the farmer, fox,",00:08:36.980,00:08:39.120
"goose, and grain problem.",00:08:39.120,00:08:40.010
"It might have stumped you when
you were a little kid.",00:08:40.010,00:08:41.669
"How many such situations
are there?",00:08:45.370,00:08:46.870
"What do you think, Tanya?",00:08:50.180,00:08:52.632
"It looks to me like all four of
individuals can be on one",00:08:52.632,00:08:56.280
side or the other.,00:08:56.280,00:08:58.740
"So for every position the farmer
can be, each of the",00:08:58.740,00:09:01.480
"other things can be on either
side of the river.",00:09:01.480,00:09:03.530
"So it would be two to the fourth
she says aggressively",00:09:06.060,00:09:09.500
and without hesitation.,00:09:09.500,00:09:12.060
"Yes, two to the fourth,
16 possibilities.",00:09:12.060,00:09:14.020
"So we could actually draw
out the entire graph.",00:09:14.020,00:09:17.590
It's small enough.,00:09:17.590,00:09:19.770
"There's another position over
here with the farmer, fox,",00:09:19.770,00:09:24.620
"goose, and grain.",00:09:24.620,00:09:25.832
"And in fact that's
the one we want.",00:09:25.832,00:09:28.560
"And if we draw out the entire
graph, it looks like this.",00:09:28.560,00:09:32.660
"This is a graph of the
situations and the allowed",00:09:35.910,00:09:40.250
connections between them.,00:09:40.250,00:09:42.960
Why are there not 16?,00:09:42.960,00:09:47.280
Because the other--,00:09:47.280,00:09:48.420
how many have I got?,00:09:48.420,00:09:49.170
Four?,00:09:49.170,00:09:49.625
10?,00:09:49.625,00:09:51.720
"The others are situations in
which somebody gets eaten.",00:09:51.720,00:09:55.600
"So we don't want to go to
any of those places.",00:09:55.600,00:09:58.490
"So having got the
representation, something",00:09:58.490,00:10:00.850
magical has happened.,00:10:00.850,00:10:02.750
"We've got our constraints
exposed.",00:10:02.750,00:10:04.030
"And that's why we build
representations.",00:10:18.420,00:10:19.860
"That's whey you algebra in high
school, because algebraic",00:10:19.860,00:10:23.080
"notation exposes the constraints
that make it",00:10:23.080,00:10:25.410
"possible to actually figure out
how many customers you get",00:10:25.410,00:10:29.630
"for the number of advertisements
you place in",00:10:29.630,00:10:31.510
the newspaper.,00:10:31.510,00:10:32.760
"So artificial intelligence is
about constraints exposed by",00:10:34.420,00:10:36.870
"representations that support
models targeted to thinking--",00:10:36.870,00:10:39.760
"actually there's one
more thing, too.",00:10:39.760,00:10:41.450
Not quite done.,00:10:41.450,00:10:42.800
"Because after all, in the end,
we have to build programs.",00:10:42.800,00:10:48.500
"So it's about algorithms enabled
by constraints exposed",00:10:48.500,00:11:04.820
"by representations that model
targeted thinking, perception,",00:11:04.820,00:11:09.510
and action.,00:11:09.510,00:11:11.000
"So these algorithms, or we might
call them just as well",00:11:11.000,00:11:15.520
"procedures, or we might call
them just as well methods,",00:11:15.520,00:11:18.620
whatever you like.,00:11:18.620,00:11:20.030
"These are the stuff of what
artificial intelligence is",00:11:20.030,00:11:21.980
"about-- methods, algorithms,
representations.",00:11:21.980,00:11:24.860
"I'd like to give you
one more example.",00:11:24.860,00:11:27.470
"It's something we call, in
artificial intelligence,",00:11:27.470,00:11:29.570
generated test.,00:11:29.570,00:11:31.770
"And it's such a simple idea,
you'll never hear it again in",00:11:31.770,00:11:33.640
this subject.,00:11:33.640,00:11:34.840
"But it's an idea you need to

definition.",00:16:24.570,00:16:27.165

"In the past, and in other
places, artificial",00:17:01.410,00:17:04.740

answer to the puzzle.",00:17:46.090,00:17:47.760

"Yeah, six.",00:18:21.995,00:18:23.040
What happened is a miracle.,00:18:23.040,00:18:25.970
"The miracle is that I have
communicated with you through",00:18:25.970,00:18:29.770

about there.",00:20:13.660,00:20:15.470

was a period in which we",00:34:15.840,00:34:21.900

made these accidental changes,",00:34:50.600,00:34:55.219
"accidental evolutionary
products,",00:34:55.219,00:34:57.210
more capable of sticking.,00:34:57.210,00:35:00.500
"This leads us to speculate on
what it was that happened",00:35:00.500,00:35:02.820
"50,000 years ago.",00:35:02.820,00:35:04.750
"And paleoanthropologists, Noam
Chomsky, a lot of people",00:35:04.750,00:35:10.520
reached similar conclusions.,00:35:10.520,00:35:12.580
And that conclusion is--,00:35:12.580,00:35:15.050
I'll quote Chomsky.,00:35:15.050,00:35:16.700
He's the voice of authority.,00:35:16.700,00:35:18.990
"""It seems that shortly before
50,000 years ago, some small",00:35:18.990,00:35:22.020
"group of us acquired the ability
to take two concepts,",00:35:22.020,00:35:26.040
"and combine them to make a
third concept, without",00:35:26.040,00:35:29.020
"disturbing the original two
concepts, without limit."" And",00:35:29.020,00:35:33.540
"from a perspective of an AI
person like me, what Chomsky",00:35:33.540,00:35:37.110
"seems to be saying is, we
learned how to begin to",00:35:37.110,00:35:39.490
"describe things, in a way
that was intimately",00:35:39.490,00:35:42.270
connected with language.,00:35:42.270,00:35:43.790
"And that, in the end, is what
separates us from the",00:35:43.790,00:35:46.360
chimpanzees.,00:35:46.360,00:35:49.150
"So you might say, well let's
just study language.",00:35:49.150,00:35:50.790
"No, you can't do that, because
we think with our eyes.",00:35:50.790,00:35:53.580
So language does two things.,00:35:53.580,00:35:55.510
"Number one, it enables us
to make descriptions.",00:35:55.510,00:35:57.790
"Descriptions enable us
to tell stories.",00:35:57.790,00:36:00.040
"And storytelling and story
understanding is what all of",00:36:00.040,00:36:02.400
education is about.,00:36:02.400,00:36:03.730
That's going up.,00:36:03.730,00:36:04.810
"And going down enables us to
marshal the resources of our",00:36:04.810,00:36:09.370
"perceptual systems, and even
command our perceptual systems",00:36:09.370,00:36:12.950
"to imagine things we've
never seen.",00:36:12.950,00:36:17.450
So here's an example.,00:36:17.450,00:36:20.120
"Imagine running down
the street with a",00:36:20.120,00:36:22.420
full bucket of water.,00:36:22.420,00:36:24.640
What happens?,00:36:24.640,00:36:25.890
Your leg gets wet.,00:36:27.810,00:36:29.100
The water sloshes out.,00:36:29.100,00:36:30.780
"You'll never find that fact
anywhere on the web.",00:36:30.780,00:36:34.600
"You've probably never been told
that that's what happens",00:36:34.600,00:36:37.470
"when you run down the street
with a full bucket of water.",00:36:37.470,00:36:39.910
"But you easily imagine this
scenario, and you know what's",00:36:39.910,00:36:43.400
going to happen.,00:36:43.400,00:36:43.990
"There was internal imagination
simulation.",00:36:43.990,00:36:47.150
"We're never going to understand
human intelligence",00:36:47.150,00:36:49.030
until we can understand that.,00:36:49.030,00:36:51.670
Here's another example.,00:36:51.670,00:36:52.540
"Imagine running down
the street with a",00:36:52.540,00:36:53.670
full bucket of nickels?,00:36:53.670,00:36:55.620
What happens?,00:36:55.620,00:36:56.870
Nickels weigh a lot.,00:36:59.460,00:37:00.415
You're going to be bent over.,00:37:00.415,00:37:01.395
You're going to stagger.,00:37:01.395,00:37:03.850
But nobody ever told you that.,00:37:03.850,00:37:05.690
"You won't find it anywhere
on the web.",00:37:05.690,00:37:08.080
"So language is at the center of
things because it enables",00:37:08.080,00:37:10.720
"storytelling going up, and
marshalling the resources of",00:37:10.720,00:37:14.380
"the perceptual apparatus,
going down.",00:37:14.380,00:37:18.240
"And that's where we're going
to finish the subject the",00:37:18.240,00:37:20.950
"semester, by trying to
understand more about that",00:37:20.950,00:37:23.320
phenomenon.,00:37:23.320,00:37:25.950
"So that concludes everything
I wanted to say about the",00:37:25.950,00:37:28.150
material and the subject.,00:37:28.150,00:37:30.520
"Now I want to turn my attention
a little bit to how",00:37:30.520,00:37:32.290
"we are going to operate
the subject.",00:37:32.290,00:37:34.090
"Because there are many
characteristics of the subject",00:37:34.090,00:37:36.915
that are confusing.,00:37:36.915,00:37:38.715
"First of all, we have
four kinds of",00:37:43.610,00:37:46.840
activities in the course.,00:37:46.840,00:37:48.180
"And each of these has
a different purpose.",00:38:17.930,00:38:22.870
So I did the lectures.,00:38:39.580,00:38:40.850
"And the lectures are supposed
to be an hour about",00:38:40.850,00:38:43.910
"introducing the material
and the big picture.",00:38:43.910,00:38:46.740
They're about powerful ideas.,00:38:46.740,00:38:48.880
"They're about the experience
side of the course.",00:38:52.138,00:38:56.060
"Let me step aside and
make a remark.",00:38:56.060,00:38:59.130
MIT is about two things.,00:38:59.130,00:39:00.390
"It's about skill building,
and it's about big ideas.",00:39:00.390,00:39:06.200
"So you can build a skill at
home, or at Dartmouth, or at",00:39:06.200,00:39:10.120
"Harvard, or Princeton, or all
those kinds of places.",00:39:10.120,00:39:13.830
"But the experience you
can only get at MIT.",00:39:13.830,00:39:16.280
"I know everybody there is
to know in artificial",00:39:16.280,00:39:18.000
intelligence.,00:39:18.000,00:39:18.940
"I can tell you about
how they think.",00:39:18.940,00:39:20.190
"I can tell you about
how I think.",00:39:20.190,00:39:21.250
"And that's something
you're not going to",00:39:21.250,00:39:22.620
get any other place.,00:39:22.620,00:39:25.120
"So that's my role, as I see it,
in giving these lectures.",00:39:25.120,00:39:29.640
"Recitations are four buttressing
and expanding on",00:39:29.640,00:39:34.160
"the material, and providing a
venue that's small enough for",00:39:34.160,00:39:37.430
discussion.,00:39:37.430,00:39:38.680
"Mega recitations are
[? a usual ?]",00:39:40.540,00:39:42.200
components of the course.,00:39:42.200,00:39:43.380
"They're taught at the same
hour on Fridays.",00:39:43.380,00:39:46.230
"Mark Seifter, my graduate
student,",00:39:46.230,00:39:48.100
will be teaching those.,00:39:48.100,00:39:49.510
"And those are wrapped around
past quiz problems.",00:39:49.510,00:39:53.140
"And Mark will show you
how to work them.",00:39:53.140,00:39:55.700
"It's very important component
to the subject.",00:39:55.700,00:40:00.050
"And finally the tutorials
are about helping",00:40:00.050,00:40:02.400
you with the homework.,00:40:02.400,00:40:04.890
"So you might say to me,
well, do I really",00:40:04.890,00:40:09.160
need to go to class?,00:40:09.160,00:40:11.590
"I like to say that the answer
is, only if you like to pass",00:40:11.590,00:40:15.170
the subject.,00:40:15.170,00:40:17.870
But you are MIT students.,00:40:17.870,00:40:19.920
"And MIT people always like
to look at the data.",00:40:19.920,00:40:22.190
"So this is a scattergram we
made after the subject was",00:40:26.150,00:40:29.640
"taught last fall, which shows
the relationship between",00:40:29.640,00:40:33.010
"attendance at lectures and the
grades awarded in the course.",00:40:33.010,00:40:38.680
"And if you're not sure what
that all means, here's the",00:40:38.680,00:40:40.820
regression line.,00:40:40.820,00:40:42.070
"So that information is a
little suspect for two",00:40:46.160,00:40:50.400
"reasons, one of which is we
asked people to self report on",00:40:50.400,00:40:55.520
"how many lectures they thought
they attended.",00:40:55.520,00:40:58.330
"And our mechanism for assigning
these numerical",00:40:58.330,00:41:02.340
grades is a little weird.,00:41:02.340,00:41:03.590
"And there's a third thing, too,
and that is, one must",00:41:06.560,00:41:08.470
"never confuse correlation
with cause.",00:41:08.470,00:41:12.860
"You can think of other
explanations for why that",00:41:12.860,00:41:15.150
"trend line goes up, different
from whether it has something",00:41:15.150,00:41:21.230
"to do with lectures producing
good grades.",00:41:21.230,00:41:25.840
"You might ask how I feel about
the people up there on the",00:41:25.840,00:41:28.070
other upper left hand corner.,00:41:28.070,00:41:30.580
"There are one or two people who
were near the top of the",00:41:30.580,00:41:32.970
"subject who didn't go
to class at all.",00:41:32.970,00:41:37.190
"And I have mixed feelings
about that.",00:41:37.190,00:41:40.890
You're adults.,00:41:40.890,00:41:41.550
It's your call.,00:41:41.550,00:41:43.460
"On the other hand, I wish that
if that's what you do",00:41:43.460,00:41:46.490
"habitually in all the subjects
you take at MIT, that you",00:41:46.490,00:41:49.780
"would resign and go somewhere
else, and let somebody else",00:41:49.780,00:41:52.450
take their slot.,00:41:52.450,00:41:53.780
"Because you're not benefiting
from the powerful ideas, and",00:41:53.780,00:41:57.050
"the other kinds of things
that involve",00:41:57.050,00:41:58.930
interaction with faculty.,00:41:58.930,00:42:01.150
So it can be done.,00:42:01.150,00:42:02.350
But I don't recommend it.,00:42:02.350,00:42:03.310
"By the way, all of the four
activities that we have here",00:42:03.310,00:42:06.970
show similar regression lines.,00:42:06.970,00:42:08.440
"But what about that
five point scale?",00:42:11.280,00:42:12.930
"Let me explain how that
works to you.",00:42:12.930,00:42:14.940
"We love to have people
ask us what the class",00:42:14.940,00:42:18.060
average is on a quiz.,00:42:18.060,00:42:20.430
"Because that's when we get
to use our blank stare.",00:42:20.430,00:42:23.480
"Because we have no idea
what the class average",00:42:23.480,00:42:26.180
ever is on any quiz.,00:42:26.180,00:42:28.740
Here's what we do.,00:42:28.740,00:42:29.990
"Like everybody else, we
start off with a score",00:42:46.110,00:42:48.660
from zero to 100.,00:42:48.660,00:42:50.680
"But then we say to ourselves,
what score would you get if",00:42:50.680,00:42:54.750
"you had a thorough understanding
of the material?",00:42:54.750,00:42:57.260
"And we say, well, for this
particular exam, it's this",00:42:57.260,00:43:00.400
number right here.,00:43:00.400,00:43:02.480
"And what score would you
get if you had a good",00:43:02.480,00:43:04.630
understanding of the material?,00:43:04.630,00:43:05.500
That's that score.,00:43:05.500,00:43:07.340
"And what happens if you're
down here is that you're",00:43:07.340,00:43:10.040
"following off the edge of the
range in which we think you",00:43:10.040,00:43:12.670
need to do more work.,00:43:12.670,00:43:14.940
"So what we do is, we say that if
you're in this range here--",00:43:14.940,00:43:18.830
"following MIT convention
with GPAs and stuff,",00:43:18.830,00:43:21.520
that gets you a five.,00:43:21.520,00:43:23.440
"If you're in this range
down here, there's a",00:43:23.440,00:43:25.300
sharp drop off to four.,00:43:25.300,00:43:28.170
"If you're in this range
down here, there's a",00:43:28.170,00:43:29.710
sharp fall off to three.,00:43:29.710,00:43:33.070
"So that means if you're in the
middle of one of those",00:43:33.070,00:43:34.950
"plateaus there's no point
in arguing with this.",00:43:34.950,00:43:37.790
"Because it's not going
to do you any good.",00:43:37.790,00:43:40.550
"We have these boundaries where
we think performance break",00:43:40.550,00:43:43.020
points are.,00:43:43.020,00:43:45.430
"So you say, well that seems
a little harsh.",00:43:45.430,00:43:47.870
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
and start arguing.",00:43:47.870,00:43:49.850
"But then we will come back with
a second major innovation",00:43:49.850,00:43:53.560
we have in the course.,00:43:53.560,00:43:54.860
"That is that your grade is
calculated in several parts.",00:43:54.860,00:44:00.300
"Part one is the max of
your grade on Q1, and",00:44:00.300,00:44:06.970
part one of the final.,00:44:06.970,00:44:09.830
"So in other words, you get
two shots at everything.",00:44:09.830,00:44:12.780
"So if you have complete glorious
undeniable horrible F",00:44:12.780,00:44:18.080
"on the first quiz, it gets
erased on the final if you do",00:44:18.080,00:44:21.540
"well on that part
of the final.",00:44:21.540,00:44:23.910
"So each quiz has
a corresponding",00:44:23.910,00:44:25.590
mirror on the final.,00:44:25.590,00:44:27.080
"You get the max of the score you
got on those two pieces.",00:44:27.080,00:44:32.680
"And now you say to me,
I'm an MIT student.",00:44:32.680,00:44:36.540
I have a lot of guts.,00:44:36.540,00:44:38.066
"I'm only going to
take the final.",00:44:38.066,00:44:39.740
It has been done.,00:44:44.020,00:44:46.060
We don't recommend it.,00:44:46.060,00:44:49.400
"And the reason we don't
recommend it is that we don't",00:44:49.400,00:44:51.970
"expect everybody to do
all of the final.",00:44:51.970,00:44:53.730
"So there would be a lot of time
pressure if you had to do",00:44:53.730,00:44:55.740
"all of the final, all five
parts of the final.",00:44:55.740,00:45:00.200
So we have four quizzes.,00:45:00.200,00:45:02.890
"And the final has a fifth part
because there's some material",00:45:02.890,00:45:05.590
"that we teach you after the last
date on which we can give",00:45:05.590,00:45:08.710
"you a final by institute
rules.",00:45:08.710,00:45:11.010
"But that's roughly
how it works.",00:45:11.010,00:45:12.050
"And you can read about more of
the details in the FAQ on the",00:45:12.050,00:45:16.690
subject homepage.,00:45:16.690,00:45:17.940
So now we're almost done.,00:45:19.910,00:45:21.050
"I just want to talk a little bit
about how we're going to",00:45:21.050,00:45:24.190
"communicate with you in the
next few days, while we're",00:45:24.190,00:45:27.840
getting ourselves organized.,00:45:27.840,00:45:29.710
"So, number one-- if I could ask
the TAs to help me pass",00:45:29.710,00:45:32.560
these out--,00:45:32.560,00:45:34.570
"we need to schedule you
into tutorials.",00:45:34.570,00:45:37.890
"So we're going to ask you to
fill out this form, and give",00:45:37.890,00:45:39.970
it to us before you leave.,00:45:39.970,00:45:41.220
"So you'll be hearing from
us once we do the sort.",00:45:44.250,00:45:48.910
"There's the issue of whether
