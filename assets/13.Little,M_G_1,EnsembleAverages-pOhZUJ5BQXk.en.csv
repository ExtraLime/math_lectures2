PROFESSOR: OK.,00:00:23.292,00:00:24.170
So let's get started.,00:00:24.170,00:00:27.390
"We want to first review Wald's
equality a little bit.",00:00:27.390,00:00:32.060
"Wald's equality is very
tricky thing.",00:00:32.060,00:00:36.230
"If you think you understand
it, you will go along.",00:00:36.230,00:00:40.590
"And at some point, you will be
using it and you will say, I",00:00:40.590,00:00:44.310
"don't understand
what this says.",00:00:44.310,00:00:47.040
"And that will happen
for a long time.",00:00:47.040,00:00:50.340
"It still happens to
me occasionally.",00:00:50.340,00:00:52.870
"What happens is you
work with it for",00:00:52.870,00:00:55.000
longer and longer times.,00:00:55.000,00:00:57.420
"The periods when it becomes
confusing become rarer.",00:00:57.420,00:01:02.280
"And the expected time
to straighten",00:01:02.280,00:01:04.190
it out becomes smaller.,00:01:04.190,00:01:06.045
"It is a strange kind
of result.",00:01:08.810,00:01:12.230
"So we started out with a
stopping trial definition.",00:01:12.230,00:01:18.700
"J is a stopping trial for a
sequence of random variables.",00:01:18.700,00:01:26.500
"If it's a random variable and
it has the property that for",00:01:26.500,00:01:30.600
"each n greater than or equal
to 1, the indicator random",00:01:30.600,00:01:34.460
"variable indicator of J
equals n is a function",00:01:34.460,00:01:38.770
of X1 to X sub n.,00:01:38.770,00:01:41.200
"In other words, the decision of
whether to stop at time n",00:01:41.200,00:01:47.840
is a function of 1 up to n.,00:01:47.840,00:01:51.210
"A possibly effective stopping
trial is the same, except that",00:01:54.437,00:01:58.040
"might be a defective
random variable.",00:01:58.040,00:02:00.000
"And the reason you want to have
possibly defective random",00:02:00.000,00:02:02.780
"variables is that before you
start analyzing something that",00:02:02.780,00:02:06.860
"might be a stopping rule, you
generally have no way of",00:02:06.860,00:02:10.150
"knowing whether that actually is
a stopping rule or whether",00:02:10.150,00:02:15.720
"it's a detective
stopping rule.",00:02:15.720,00:02:17.250
"So you might as well just say
it's a defective stopping rule",00:02:17.250,00:02:20.740
"to start with and show
that it's not.",00:02:20.740,00:02:24.680
"Then from that, we went on to
Wald's equality which added",00:02:24.680,00:02:28.930
"the condition that X sub n that
this is based on is a",00:02:28.930,00:02:33.690
"sequence of IID random
variables.",00:02:33.690,00:02:35.930
"To be a stopping trial,
you don't",00:02:35.930,00:02:38.450
need IID random variables.,00:02:38.450,00:02:40.240
"You don't need any restriction
at all, other than the fact",00:02:40.240,00:02:43.760
"that you can make a decision on
when to stop based on what",00:02:43.760,00:02:46.960
you've already seen.,00:02:46.960,00:02:49.310
"That's the only condition
there.",00:02:49.310,00:02:51.030
"Wald's equality is based on this
extra condition that the",00:02:51.030,00:02:55.270
random variables are IID.,00:02:55.270,00:02:58.030
"Each of them, with
some mean, X bar.",00:02:58.030,00:03:01.710
"If J is a stopping trial and as
the expected value of J is",00:03:01.710,00:03:06.880
"less than infinity, then the
sum S sub J at the stopping",00:03:06.880,00:03:12.570
"trial, J, satisfies this
relationship here.",00:03:12.570,00:03:17.380
"And remember we proved
that last time.",00:03:17.380,00:03:20.040
"And the key to proving it,
the hard part of it--",00:03:20.040,00:03:25.896
"well, it's not hard
if you see it.",00:03:25.896,00:03:28.880
"But what's difficult is when you
start looking at how you",00:03:28.880,00:03:35.810
"find the expected value of S
sub J that's equal to a sum",00:03:35.810,00:03:40.820
"over n of X sub n times the
indicator function of J being",00:03:40.820,00:03:48.360
greater than or equal to n.,00:03:48.360,00:03:50.910
"Now the condition here is that
this indicator at J equals n",00:03:50.910,00:03:56.810
"is a function of these
quantities here.",00:03:56.810,00:03:59.810
"When you add the IID quantity
down here, what you find then",00:03:59.810,00:04:04.790
"is the indicator function for J
greater than or equal to n.",00:04:04.790,00:04:09.180
"It's also the indicator function
for J 1 minus the",00:04:09.180,00:04:13.160
"indicator function for
J less than n.",00:04:13.160,00:04:17.860
"It's independent of X1 up to
X sub blah, blah, blah.",00:04:17.860,00:04:25.090
"That indicator random variable
is then a function only of X1",00:04:25.090,00:04:30.430
"up to X sub n minus 1, because
it's 1 minus the indicator of",00:04:30.430,00:04:35.770
"J less than or equal
to n minus 1.",00:04:35.770,00:04:39.190
"J less than n, which means that
X1 up to X n minus 1 is",00:04:39.190,00:04:46.890
independent of Xn.,00:04:46.890,00:04:49.090
"And X1 up to X n minus 1 is what
determines this indicator",00:04:49.090,00:05:01.050
function J less than n.,00:05:01.050,00:05:04.770
"It's the J less than n
which is important.",00:05:04.770,00:05:08.870
"So we got that Wald's
equality.",00:05:08.870,00:05:14.730
"What I want to do today to start
off with is to do the",00:05:14.730,00:05:18.750
"elementary renewal theorem,
which is a strange result.",00:05:18.750,00:05:23.350
"Wald's equality, you can use it
to determine the expected",00:05:23.350,00:05:27.380
value of N of t.,00:05:27.380,00:05:29.140
"Now why do we want to determine
the expected",00:05:29.140,00:05:31.300
value of N of t?,00:05:31.300,00:05:33.220
"We already have shown in great
generality that there's a very",00:05:33.220,00:05:38.450
"nice, with probability, one type
limit theorem associated",00:05:38.450,00:05:44.140
with N of t over t.,00:05:44.140,00:05:45.570
"We know that N of t over
t approaches t",00:05:45.570,00:05:49.310
with probability 1.,00:05:49.310,00:05:50.670
"Namely, all the sample
functions, except a set of",00:05:50.670,00:05:53.270
"probability 0, all approach
this same",00:05:53.270,00:05:57.330
"constant, 1 over X bar.",00:05:57.330,00:05:59.430
"So it seems that we know
everything we want to know",00:05:59.430,00:06:02.530
"about the expected value of
N of t, about N of t, and",00:06:02.530,00:06:06.360
everything else.,00:06:06.360,00:06:08.220
But no.,00:06:08.220,00:06:10.470
"And there are two reasons
why you want to do",00:06:10.470,00:06:12.370
something more than that.,00:06:12.370,00:06:14.180
"One of them is that very often
you want to know how N of t",00:06:14.180,00:06:25.110
"over t approaches the limit
of 1 over X bar.",00:06:25.110,00:06:29.900
"The other is that sometimes you
really are interested in,",00:06:29.900,00:06:33.430
"what is N of t at some
finite value of t?",00:06:33.430,00:06:37.880
"N of t is a random variable,
some finite value of t.",00:06:37.880,00:06:40.830
So you can't evaluate it.,00:06:40.830,00:06:42.590
"But at least you would
like to know what its",00:06:42.590,00:06:44.460
expected value is.,00:06:44.460,00:06:45.690
"You might want to know what
it's variance is too.",00:06:45.690,00:06:48.420
"But people who study renewal
theory have spent an enormous",00:06:48.420,00:06:52.880
"amount of time on trying
to find the expected",00:06:52.880,00:06:55.960
value of N of t.,00:06:55.960,00:06:57.940
"It's the basic problem that
people work on all the time.",00:06:57.940,00:07:03.120
"The elementary renewal theorem
is something which says a",00:07:03.120,00:07:12.490
little more for finite times.,00:07:12.490,00:07:13.940
"And it actually says the
expected value of N of t over",00:07:16.700,00:07:20.870
"t and the limit is equal
to 1 over X bar.",00:07:20.870,00:07:25.810
"Sounds like much less than
what we've done before.",00:07:25.810,00:07:29.480
"And perhaps this is because this
was a computational thing",00:07:29.480,00:07:35.080
"that people could do without
computers, before computers",00:07:35.080,00:07:37.850
came along.,00:07:37.850,00:07:39.630
"And all the work on renewal
theory went on basically from",00:07:39.630,00:07:43.990
1900 until about 1970.,00:07:43.990,00:07:46.900
"People didn't have any computers
to compute things.",00:07:46.900,00:07:49.245
"And all the mathematicians who
were interested in this field",00:07:53.250,00:07:56.620
"really loved to compute
ugly things.",00:07:56.620,00:07:59.270
"And they computed ugly
things all the time.",00:07:59.270,00:08:01.850
"And the expected value of N of
t was one of the ugly things",00:08:01.850,00:08:05.430
"that they could really
do a lot with.",00:08:05.430,00:08:07.350
"So it probably has more
importance in this field than",00:08:07.350,00:08:10.440
it deserves.,00:08:10.440,00:08:12.200
"But it does have some
importance.",00:08:12.200,00:08:14.830
"Anyway, what we want to do is
to get some idea of why this",00:08:14.830,00:08:19.080
"elementary renewal
theorem is true.",00:08:19.080,00:08:21.240
"Later on we will study how to
actually find the expected",00:08:21.240,00:08:24.870
value of N of t.,00:08:24.870,00:08:27.230
"N of t is the number of arrivals
that have occurred up",00:08:27.230,00:08:29.870
to and including t.,00:08:29.870,00:08:32.820
"So N of t plus 1 is the
number of the first",00:08:32.820,00:08:37.110
arrival after t since--,00:08:37.110,00:08:44.000
that should be a t there--,00:08:44.000,00:08:45.900
"the expected value of N of t is
finite, the expected value",00:08:45.900,00:08:49.930
J is also finite.,00:08:49.930,00:08:52.740
"In other words, we're defining
J to be N of t plus 1.",00:08:52.740,00:08:57.800
"We want to show the J is
actually a stopping trial.",00:08:57.800,00:09:03.640
"And therefore we can use
Wald's equality on it.",00:09:03.640,00:09:07.430
"Let's stop and think
for a minute.",00:09:07.430,00:09:09.110
"Why don't we just define a
stopping trial to be the",00:09:09.110,00:09:16.530
"number of arrivals that have
occurred up until time t?",00:09:16.530,00:09:21.370
What's the matter with that?,00:09:21.370,00:09:22.770
"If I let you observe a sequence
of these IID random",00:09:27.620,00:09:33.990
"variables, the first
inter-arrival interval, the",00:09:33.990,00:09:36.620
"second inter-arrival interval,
the third inter-arrival",00:09:36.620,00:09:40.770
"interval, and so forth, and I
say stop when you have the",00:09:40.770,00:09:47.600
last dozen that's less than t.,00:09:47.600,00:09:51.340
"The question is, is that
a stopping trial?",00:09:51.340,00:09:56.330
"You have to be able to determine
that just from what",00:09:56.330,00:09:59.750
"you've seen up until
the present.",00:09:59.750,00:10:03.810
"But when you see that last
arrival, there's no way you",00:10:03.810,00:10:06.750
"know that it's the last arrival
less than t unless you",00:10:06.750,00:10:10.110
"see the arrival after that,
also to see whether that's",00:10:10.110,00:10:13.400
greater than t.,00:10:13.400,00:10:14.680
"So the only way you can define
a stopping trial of this form",00:10:14.680,00:10:19.640
"is to define the stopping trial
not at N of t, but of N",00:10:19.640,00:10:24.240
of t plus 1.,00:10:24.240,00:10:26.560
"So now we want to apply Wald's
equality to the expected value",00:10:26.560,00:10:33.130
"of the time at which N
of t plus 1 arises.",00:10:33.130,00:10:37.540
"Do you see now why we want to
call this a stopping trial",00:10:37.540,00:10:40.650
instead of a stopping time?,00:10:40.650,00:10:42.710
"If you call that a stopping
time, you want to know what",00:10:42.710,00:10:45.810
you were doing at this point.,00:10:45.810,00:10:47.860
"Because the stopping trial says
you're looking at the",00:10:47.860,00:10:51.470
"first arrival that occurs
after time t.",00:10:51.470,00:10:57.030
"Then you're looking at
the time at which",00:10:57.030,00:10:58.840
that arrival occurs.,00:10:58.840,00:11:00.240
"Wald's equality says the
expected value of that time is",00:11:00.240,00:11:05.900
"equal to the expected value of
the inter-arrival time times",00:11:05.900,00:11:10.870
"the expected value of J.
J is a stopping trial.",00:11:10.870,00:11:14.790
"The expected value
of J is just--",00:11:14.790,00:11:18.210
J is N of t plus 1.,00:11:18.210,00:11:19.970
"So that's expected value of
N of t plus 1 times X bar.",00:11:19.970,00:11:25.240
That's simple.,00:11:25.240,00:11:27.120
"It's simple until you try to
recreate that argument.",00:11:27.120,00:11:31.280
"I would suggest to all of you
that sometime later today you",00:11:31.280,00:11:35.660
"go back and try to recreate
this argument.",00:11:35.660,00:11:37.905
"And if you can do it, then
you understand it.",00:11:37.905,00:11:40.820
"If you can't, think about
it a little more.",00:11:40.820,00:11:43.980
"Because it is deceptively
simple.",00:11:43.980,00:11:45.715
"So that was a relationship
we had.",00:11:48.620,00:11:52.290
"Wald's equality then is
relating two unknown",00:11:52.290,00:11:55.160
quantities.,00:11:55.160,00:11:55.770
"It's relating the expected
value of N of t with the",00:11:55.770,00:11:59.250
"expected value of the first
arrival time after t.",00:11:59.250,00:12:05.560
"That's one of the troubles
with Wald's equality.",00:12:05.560,00:12:07.710
"It relates two things that,
neither of which you know in",00:12:07.710,00:12:11.410
many cases.,00:12:11.410,00:12:12.400
"There are many situations
in which you do",00:12:12.400,00:12:14.440
know one or the other.,00:12:14.440,00:12:15.870
We talked about one last time.,00:12:15.870,00:12:18.500
"But in most of them, you don't
know either of them.",00:12:18.500,00:12:22.250
"So it doesn't help
you immediately.",00:12:22.250,00:12:24.190
"You have to find
something else.",00:12:24.190,00:12:26.560
"So what we're going to do here
is say, well we can't find",00:12:26.560,00:12:30.820
"expected value of N
of t from this.",00:12:30.820,00:12:32.880
But we can at least bound it.,00:12:32.880,00:12:34.570
"And we can bound it by saying
that S sub N of t plus 1.",00:12:34.570,00:12:39.330
"This is the time of the
first arrival after t.",00:12:39.330,00:12:43.050
"The first arrival after t has
to be at a time greater than",00:12:43.050,00:12:46.750
or equal to t.,00:12:46.750,00:12:48.000
"So expected value of S sub N
of t plus 1 also is greater",00:12:48.000,00:12:53.450
than or equal to t.,00:12:53.450,00:12:55.130
"So expected value of N of t,
solving this equation is",00:12:55.130,00:13:00.810
"expected value of S sub N of t
plus 1 over X bar minus 1.",00:13:00.810,00:13:06.960
"And then you lower bound
expected value of this first",00:13:06.960,00:13:10.900
arrival after t by t.,00:13:10.900,00:13:14.330
"So the expected value of N of
t has to be greater than t",00:13:14.330,00:13:18.740
over X bar minus 1.,00:13:18.740,00:13:22.140
"Well this seems to be useful,
because if what you're",00:13:22.140,00:13:26.010
"interested in is the expected
value of N of t over t.",00:13:26.010,00:13:29.850
"And that's what we're interested
in for the",00:13:29.850,00:13:31.670
elementary renewal theorem.,00:13:31.670,00:13:35.030
"You're saying that that's
greater than 1 over X bar",00:13:35.030,00:13:39.240
minus 1 over t.,00:13:39.240,00:13:41.280
"And when t gets large, that 1
over t term gets very small.",00:13:41.280,00:13:45.555
"What that means is you have a
lower bound on expected value",00:13:50.920,00:13:54.020
"of N of t, which is going
to 1 over X bar.",00:13:54.020,00:14:00.090
"The elementary renewal theorem
then says, let X bar be the",00:14:00.090,00:14:03.250
mean inter-renewal.,00:14:03.250,00:14:04.500
"Then the limit of t approaches
infinity of the expected value",00:14:06.250,00:14:10.180
"of N of t over t is equal
to 1 over X bar.",00:14:10.180,00:14:14.300
Very weak result.,00:14:14.300,00:14:16.990
"At least it seems to be
a very weak result.",00:14:16.990,00:14:21.030
"But we need an upper bound on
the expected value of N of t.",00:14:21.030,00:14:25.760
"We don't have any upper bound
on this quantity here.",00:14:25.760,00:14:29.180
Because you remember these--,00:14:29.180,00:14:31.150
"Actually S sub N of t plus 1
minus t is this residual",00:14:35.910,00:14:46.860
life at time t.,00:14:46.860,00:14:48.570
"And we found that the residual
life at time t can be pretty",00:14:48.570,00:14:51.490
badly behaved.,00:14:51.490,00:14:53.230
So we're in trouble.,00:14:53.230,00:14:54.140
So what do we do?,00:14:54.140,00:14:55.890
"Well the argument is done
carefully in the notes.",00:14:55.890,00:15:01.560
"It's very discouraging to me,
because this should be a",00:15:01.560,00:15:04.240
simple result.,00:15:04.240,00:15:05.750
"And here this argument
is incredibly tricky.",00:15:05.750,00:15:10.600
"So we're working very hard to
do something that's not--",00:15:10.600,00:15:15.570
"Well, it seems like it ought
to be elementary.",00:15:15.570,00:15:19.770
"It is an elementary result in
terms of its usefulness.",00:15:19.770,00:15:23.270
"It's a very hard result in terms
of trying to prove it.",00:15:23.270,00:15:27.700
"So the way you prove this is
first you truncate the random",00:15:27.700,00:15:31.460
"variable X. Namely instead of
having a random variable with",00:15:31.460,00:15:37.000
"this arbitrary, non-negative
probability distribution, what",00:15:37.000,00:15:41.340
"you do is you look at another
random variable, which has the",00:15:41.340,00:15:45.580
"same distribution up until some
large value B. And then",00:15:45.580,00:15:50.140
you truncate it at that point.,00:15:50.140,00:15:52.000
"So the distribution function
looks like--",00:15:52.000,00:15:54.210
"Here's f of x, however
it might look.",00:15:59.970,00:16:03.230
This is 1 here.,00:16:06.460,00:16:08.140
"This is supposed to be
going up towards 1.",00:16:08.140,00:16:10.390
"And what you do is you truncate
it at some point B.",00:16:13.110,00:16:18.350
"So this is a truncated version
which stops at B. And this",00:16:18.350,00:16:28.280
here is the actual Fx of x.,00:16:28.280,00:16:34.850
"So first you truncate
the random variable.",00:16:34.850,00:16:38.010
"Then you prove the elementary
renewal theorem for that",00:16:38.010,00:16:43.190
"truncated random variable,
which is easy.",00:16:43.190,00:16:46.680
"Because at that point, the
expected value of S sub N of t",00:16:46.680,00:16:50.820
"plus 1 is less than or
equal to t plus B.",00:16:50.820,00:17:01.080
"And then the next thing you have
to do is monkey around",00:17:01.080,00:17:03.570
"with the difference between
X bar and X tilde bar.",00:17:03.570,00:17:11.079
"And you have to go through a
bunch of strange inequalities.",00:17:11.079,00:17:14.520
"You have to then let B approach
infinity as t is",00:17:14.520,00:17:17.880
"approaching infinity in
just the right way.",00:17:17.880,00:17:20.460
"And when you get all of done
doing this, bingo.",00:17:20.460,00:17:24.230
"You get the elementary
renewal theorem.",00:17:24.230,00:17:26.530
"You see why I don't want to
go through that in class.",00:17:26.530,00:17:30.230
"And you see, I hope, why
probably most of you will not",00:17:30.230,00:17:35.380
"want to go through it
in detail either.",00:17:35.380,00:17:38.400
"Because if you want to learn
how to do truncation",00:17:38.400,00:17:41.800
"arguments, this is probably not
the best one to use as a",00:17:41.800,00:17:48.090
"way of figuring out
how to do that.",00:17:48.090,00:17:50.330
"If you want to learn how to use
truncation arguments, do",00:17:50.330,00:17:55.170
"the Weak law of large
numbers where you",00:17:55.170,00:17:58.310
don't have a variance.,00:17:58.310,00:17:59.460
It's done back in chapter one.,00:17:59.460,00:18:02.010
"It's a nice relatively simple
argument where you truncate a",00:18:02.010,00:18:05.950
random variable.,00:18:05.950,00:18:06.860
This one is just peculiar.,00:18:06.860,00:18:08.900
"We do all of that with stopping
trials as we've",00:18:14.990,00:18:18.080
defined them.,00:18:18.080,00:18:18.950
"Very often, and particularly
when you get to queuing",00:18:18.950,00:18:21.890
"theory, you want to define
stopping trials in a more",00:18:21.890,00:18:25.730
general way.,00:18:25.730,00:18:27.260
"And here's a more general
definition.",00:18:27.260,00:18:28.903
"A generalized stopping trial
for a sequence of pairs of",00:18:32.300,00:18:36.690
"random variables, X1, V1, X2,
V2, X3, V3, is a positive",00:18:36.690,00:18:43.840
"integer random variable such as
for each n greater than or",00:18:43.840,00:18:47.770
"equal to 1, the indicator
function, which tells you",00:18:47.770,00:18:51.310
"whether to stop or not, is
a function of X1, V1, X2,",00:18:51.310,00:18:55.730
"V2, up to Xn, Vn.",00:18:55.730,00:18:58.020
"In other words, you don't have
to decide whether to stop or",00:18:58.020,00:19:01.060
"not in terms of these random
variables X1 to Xn that you're",00:19:01.060,00:19:05.270
interested in.,00:19:05.270,00:19:06.430
"You have this other set of
random variables too.",00:19:06.430,00:19:09.400
"Typically in queuing situations,
these other random",00:19:09.400,00:19:12.740
"variables that you're
interested",00:19:12.740,00:19:14.140
in are service times.,00:19:14.140,00:19:16.170
And the X's are arrival times.,00:19:16.170,00:19:19.740
"And these things are going on
in parallel with each other.",00:19:19.740,00:19:24.250
"And still, you can do the same
arguments about stopping",00:19:24.250,00:19:29.950
"trials by looking at just the
past history of the input",00:19:29.950,00:19:37.630
"random variables and these
other random variables,",00:19:37.630,00:19:40.800
whatever they happen to be.,00:19:40.800,00:19:43.550
"Wald's equality then says that
the expected value of S sub n",00:19:43.550,00:19:48.530
"is equal to X bar times the
expected value J, where Sn is",00:19:48.530,00:19:53.610
the sum of the X's.,00:19:53.610,00:19:55.920
"And Wald's equality holds
by exactly the",00:19:55.920,00:19:58.130
same proof as before.,00:19:58.130,00:20:00.680
There's nothing new.,00:20:00.680,00:20:01.580
"You just look at the proof
and you say, OK.",00:20:01.580,00:20:07.110
"All these V's are involved
there also.",00:20:07.110,00:20:10.560
"You can replace each of Vi in
this definition with a whole",00:20:10.560,00:20:14.670
vector of random variable.,00:20:14.670,00:20:16.170
"So you can make this
as general as you",00:20:16.170,00:20:18.420
want to make it.,00:20:18.420,00:20:19.710
"In fact, a lot of people prove
Wald's equality by skipping",00:20:19.710,00:20:27.030
"all of this stuff about
stopping trials.",00:20:27.030,00:20:30.760
"And what they say is that the
rule for stopping at time J is",00:20:30.760,00:20:41.530
"independent of all of
the future arrivals.",00:20:41.530,00:20:46.450
"And that lets you prove the
theorem immediately.",00:20:46.450,00:20:49.490
"It doesn't give you any clue at
all as to when that holds,",00:20:49.490,00:20:56.490
"so that in fact you're taking
Wald's equality and making it",00:20:56.490,00:21:00.350
essentially a truism.,00:21:00.350,00:21:02.680
"And you're avoiding the real
problem, which is to know when",00:21:02.680,00:21:05.880
"you have a stopping rule
and when you don't",00:21:05.880,00:21:08.980
have a stopping rule.,00:21:08.980,00:21:10.360
"But anyway, we can generalize
it in this way.",00:21:10.360,00:21:15.230
"And now we want to use this to
look at a fairly general",00:21:15.230,00:21:21.020
queueing situation.,00:21:21.020,00:21:23.020
"We talked about the G/G/M
queue before.",00:21:23.020,00:21:26.600
"Let's just talk about the G/G/1
queue at this point.",00:21:26.600,00:21:30.060
"This is a queue with general
independent IID and her",00:21:30.060,00:21:34.860
"arrival times, IID
service times.",00:21:34.860,00:21:39.730
"So what you wind up with is
at time 0, you assume that",00:21:39.730,00:21:45.080
there's an arrival at time 0.,00:21:45.080,00:21:47.330
"You don't count it as part of
the arrival renewal process.",00:21:47.330,00:21:51.970
So this arrival is here.,00:21:51.970,00:21:54.560
"That arrival goes
into service.",00:21:54.560,00:21:56.780
"There's some service
time V sub 0.",00:21:56.780,00:22:00.430
"At some inter-arrival time, X1,
another arrival comes in.",00:22:00.430,00:22:06.730
"In this particular sample
function here, the second",00:22:06.730,00:22:10.760
"arrival comes in before this 0
arrival that we didn't account",00:22:10.760,00:22:17.850
finishes service.,00:22:17.850,00:22:20.030
And I'm sorry.,00:22:20.030,00:22:20.770
I should have--,00:22:20.770,00:22:22.500
"It might make better sense to
call this X1 and call this V1.",00:22:22.500,00:22:26.680
"It would make all the
notation simpler.",00:22:26.680,00:22:29.610
"Or call this X0 and
call this V0.",00:22:29.610,00:22:32.290
"But unfortunately that's not
consistent with any of the",00:22:34.920,00:22:37.990
"notation that anybody
uses for talking",00:22:37.990,00:22:40.750
about renewal processes.,00:22:40.750,00:22:42.940
"Because you want these X's
to be the elements",00:22:42.940,00:22:46.170
of a renewal process.,00:22:46.170,00:22:48.280
"You want the V's to be
IID random variables.",00:22:48.280,00:22:52.520
"And this, unfortunately, is
the way it has to be.",00:22:52.520,00:22:56.560
So these arrivals come in.,00:22:56.560,00:22:58.640
"This is the inter-arrival
time before--",00:22:58.640,00:23:01.465
"This is S1 here, which is
the time of the first",00:23:04.900,00:23:08.640
arrival after 0.,00:23:08.640,00:23:10.810
"This is S2, which is the
time of the first",00:23:10.810,00:23:13.540
arrival after time 0.,00:23:13.540,00:23:18.350
"And when you count the arrival
at time 0 in, this function",00:23:18.350,00:23:22.740
here is N of t plus 1.,00:23:22.740,00:23:28.730
"So this is N of t plus
1 going along here.",00:23:28.730,00:23:32.070
"This is the arrival process
plus 1, where now we've",00:23:32.070,00:23:35.940
"counted this arrival
at time 0.",00:23:35.940,00:23:39.220
"You have these services
going on.",00:23:39.220,00:23:41.300
"V0 for this particular sample
function is the time of the",00:23:41.300,00:23:46.230
service of this 0 arrival.,00:23:46.230,00:23:50.410
"V1 is the time of the
service of this X1--",00:23:50.410,00:23:55.990
"well, it's the service time of
the arrival that has come in",00:23:55.990,00:24:15.300
at this point.,00:24:15.300,00:24:16.230
"This is the service time of
the arrival at time 0.",00:24:16.230,00:24:22.530
"This is the service time of
the arrival at this time.",00:24:22.530,00:24:26.190
"This as the service time
of the arrival at",00:24:26.190,00:24:28.230
this time and so forth.,00:24:28.230,00:24:29.840
"I want to make sure that you
understand this model here",00:24:35.170,00:24:38.340
before we go on.,00:24:38.340,00:24:40.540
"Because if you don't understand
this, you won't",00:24:40.540,00:24:42.480
"understand anything
we do after this.",00:24:42.480,00:24:44.940
"If you look at this now, you see
a departure process which",00:24:47.610,00:24:51.060
is going on also.,00:24:51.060,00:24:53.600
"These departure times are
determined partly as a sum of",00:24:53.600,00:25:03.220
"the number of customers to
have departed by time t.",00:25:03.220,00:25:07.920
"And this example here is just
the sum of V0 plus V1 plus V2.",00:25:07.920,00:25:14.720
"So it's almost the same as this
renewal process here,",00:25:14.720,00:25:19.810
"except here you're talking about
a renewal process of",00:25:19.810,00:25:22.920
"dealing with the departure
times.",00:25:22.920,00:25:25.310
"This changes any time that
the queue empties out.",00:25:25.310,00:25:29.340
"Because when the queue empties
out, the server isn't doing",00:25:29.340,00:25:32.680
anything for a while.,00:25:32.680,00:25:34.150
"So suddenly, the number of
departures slows up.",00:25:34.150,00:25:37.675
"And in some sense, you
reset things here.",00:25:40.200,00:25:43.750
"What I want to do in this
argument today is to explain",00:25:43.750,00:25:47.800
"much more carefully why you can
actually restart things",00:25:47.800,00:25:52.030
when this new arrival occurs.,00:25:52.030,00:25:55.110
"So I want to say that, in fact,
this is a renewal time",00:25:55.110,00:26:00.710
"for this entire queuing
process.",00:26:00.710,00:26:04.650
"These are renewal times
for the arrivals",00:26:04.650,00:26:07.800
to the queuing process.,00:26:07.800,00:26:09.510
"This thing here, the next
arrival to an empty server and",00:26:09.510,00:26:15.350
"so forth, are all, in fact,
renewals of the",00:26:15.350,00:26:20.830
entire queuing system.,00:26:20.830,00:26:22.640
"We want to understand
why that is.",00:26:22.640,00:26:24.960
"We want to use this idea
of stopping trials",00:26:24.960,00:26:28.100
to understand this.,00:26:28.100,00:26:30.440
"So look at the first arrival
to start a new busy period.",00:26:30.440,00:26:34.770
"Well, think of that as a
generalized stopping trial.",00:26:34.770,00:26:38.130
"Why is it generalized
stopping trial?",00:26:38.130,00:26:40.960
"Well the sequence of paired
random variables we want to",00:26:40.960,00:26:43.850
"look at is X1, V0, X2, V1,
X3, V2, and so forth.",00:26:43.850,00:26:52.430
"And stopping at J equals 3 is
actually a function of this",00:26:52.430,00:26:59.660
"first pair, the second pair, and
the third pair, which is",00:26:59.660,00:27:06.070
"the restriction we need
for a stopping trial.",00:27:06.070,00:27:09.630
"So the stopping trial stop when
the first arrival comes",00:27:09.630,00:27:15.640
"to an empty system is in fact a
function of the arrivals and",00:27:15.640,00:27:21.960
"as the departure intervals
up until that time.",00:27:21.960,00:27:25.230
"Wald's equality holds because,
in fact, every time you get a",00:27:28.050,00:27:32.870
"new arrival, it's independent
of all the old arrivals.",00:27:32.870,00:27:37.440
"It's independent of all
the old service times.",00:27:37.440,00:27:39.960
"It's independent of all
the new service",00:27:39.960,00:27:41.780
"times also, sort of.",00:27:41.780,00:27:44.640
"But you have to be more
careful with that.",00:27:44.640,00:27:48.080
"But in fact, the service
times are all IID.",00:27:48.080,00:27:51.160
So that works too.,00:27:51.160,00:27:54.030
So Wald's equality holds here.,00:27:54.030,00:27:56.950
"But that's not what we're
interested in here.",00:27:56.950,00:28:00.190
"What we're interested in is
trying to show that you do get",00:28:00.190,00:28:04.070
renewals at these times here.,00:28:04.070,00:28:07.310
"So let's try to argue
why that is.",00:28:07.310,00:28:11.800
Did I--,00:28:11.800,00:28:12.861
AUDIENCE: Question?,00:28:12.861,00:28:16.298
"Do V's have to be independent
somehow?",00:28:16.298,00:28:18.262
PROFESSOR: What?,00:28:18.262,00:28:19.110
"AUDIENCE: Do the V's have to
be independent somehow?",00:28:19.110,00:28:21.360
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:28:21.360,00:28:22.072
Yes.,00:28:22.072,00:28:22.310
"AUDIENCE: So they have to be
independent from one another?",00:28:22.310,00:28:24.685
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:28:24.685,00:28:25.635
"AUDIENCE: It was the case
here, you said.",00:28:25.635,00:28:27.550
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:28:27.550,00:28:28.180
"That's what you mean
by a G/G/1 queue.",00:28:28.180,00:28:32.490
A G/G/1 queue is--,00:28:32.490,00:28:34.500
"AUDIENCE: You have a service
time and the arrival.",00:28:34.500,00:28:36.600
PROFESSOR: Service time.,00:28:36.600,00:28:37.120
"AUDIENCE: They're both
independent.",00:28:37.120,00:28:38.036
"PROFESSOR: They're both
independent, yes.",00:28:38.036,00:28:39.870
"AUDIENCE: And that makes
the departure?",00:28:39.870,00:28:41.785
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:28:41.785,00:28:42.810
"And in fact, the first G says
that the arrivals are IID,",00:28:42.810,00:28:47.480
"have an arbitrary
distribution.",00:28:47.480,00:28:50.390
"The second G says that the
service times are IID, but",00:28:50.390,00:28:54.640
"have an arbitrary
distribution.",00:28:54.640,00:28:56.960
"And then the 1, our the M, or
whatever, says how many",00:28:56.960,00:29:01.240
servers there are.,00:29:01.240,00:29:04.196
"AUDIENCE: And that makes the
departures independent?",00:29:04.196,00:29:07.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:29:07.010,00:29:07.950
"So you can really have much
more general queuing",00:29:07.950,00:29:10.450
situations than this.,00:29:10.450,00:29:11.720
And you often do.,00:29:11.720,00:29:13.940
Yes?,00:29:13.940,00:29:14.370
"AUDIENCE: With the departure
process, it's not a renewal?",00:29:14.370,00:29:17.457
PROFESSOR: What?,00:29:17.457,00:29:18.380
AUDIENCE: The departures.,00:29:18.380,00:29:18.600
"PROFESSOR: The departure process
is not a renewal",00:29:18.600,00:29:21.670
"process, because every
once in while, the",00:29:21.670,00:29:23.860
server stops doing anything.,00:29:23.860,00:29:27.370
What?,00:29:27.370,00:29:27.580
"AUDIENCE: That's how I got
confused actually.",00:29:27.580,00:29:29.530
"Because every once in a while,
the server somehow--",00:29:29.530,00:29:31.750
"PROFESSOR: Every once
in a while, the",00:29:31.750,00:29:32.800
server stops working.,00:29:32.800,00:29:34.560
"But V1, V2, V3 are defined
as the service time",00:29:34.560,00:29:42.470
of the first customer.,00:29:42.470,00:29:44.470
"Well actually V0, the service
time of the zeroth customer.",00:29:44.470,00:29:49.260
"V1 is the service time of
the first customer.",00:29:49.260,00:29:52.720
"Namely the time from when the
customer enters service to",00:29:52.720,00:29:56.100
"when the customer's finished
with service.",00:29:56.100,00:29:57.795
"And the reason why
these things--",00:30:01.740,00:30:04.400
"If you looked at the sequence
V0, V1, V2, V3, you could call",00:30:04.400,00:30:09.480
that a renewal process.,00:30:09.480,00:30:12.130
"But it wouldn't be a renewal
process of any interest to",00:30:12.130,00:30:15.040
"you, because it would be a
renewal process where the",00:30:15.040,00:30:21.650
"renewals occur at V0,
at V0 plus V1, at V0",00:30:21.650,00:30:27.540
plus V1 plus V2.,00:30:27.540,00:30:29.320
"And those might not be the time
when these customers are",00:30:29.320,00:30:32.340
finishing service.,00:30:32.340,00:30:33.590
"Because there are these
idle times to take",00:30:36.310,00:30:38.410
into account also.,00:30:38.410,00:30:40.020
"If you didn't have the ideal
times to take into account,",00:30:40.020,00:30:43.400
"you wouldn't have to think about
queuing theory at all.",00:30:43.400,00:30:46.610
"Because all you'd have is two
separate and independent",00:30:46.610,00:30:49.810
renewal processes.,00:30:49.810,00:30:52.090
"So this is where all of the
gimmickry in all of queuing",00:30:52.090,00:30:57.270
theory comes from.,00:30:57.270,00:31:00.050
"But what I wanted to come back
and say that I didn't say very",00:31:00.050,00:31:06.330
well before.,00:31:06.330,00:31:08.350
"In the notes, the assumption
is that these",00:31:08.350,00:31:11.070
pairs here are IID.,00:31:11.070,00:31:13.580
"What you really would like is
something a little more",00:31:16.740,00:31:19.370
"general than that, which says
that each Xi is independent of",00:31:19.370,00:31:25.450
all of the earlier pairs.,00:31:25.450,00:31:28.790
"So that that's giving you a
little bit of flexibility for",00:31:28.790,00:31:33.560
how these other random,00:31:33.560,00:31:34.810
variables impact the situation.,00:31:34.810,00:31:39.581
"And in fact, they can be
anything at all, just so long",00:31:39.581,00:31:42.840
"as you have this condition that
each Xi is independent of",00:31:42.840,00:31:46.980
all these past things here.,00:31:46.980,00:31:48.520
"So we said that Wald's
equality holds.",00:31:54.230,00:31:56.205
"But the other thing, which is
what we really want, is the",00:31:58.900,00:32:03.060
new arrivals.,00:32:03.060,00:32:04.720
"Namely the arrival after S3,
which comes at S3 plus X3.",00:32:04.720,00:32:15.360
"That's X sub J plus 1, X sub
J plus 2, and so forth.",00:32:15.360,00:32:19.630
"And the service times, in this
case V sub J, is the service",00:32:19.630,00:32:25.770
time that occurs after this.,00:32:25.770,00:32:29.160
"V sub J plus 1, and so forth,
are all independent of the old",00:32:29.160,00:32:33.820
"arrivals and the old
service times.",00:32:33.820,00:32:36.840
"So in fact, this is actually
saying that everything that",00:32:36.840,00:32:40.170
"happens after this J's arrival
is independent of everything",00:32:40.170,00:32:48.670
that happens before.,00:32:48.670,00:32:49.920
"And when I say everything, you
have to be careful about that,",00:32:49.920,00:32:56.550
"because we're talking about all
the inter-arrival times",00:32:56.550,00:32:59.790
that occur after this.,00:32:59.790,00:33:01.470
"And we're talking about all of
the service times that occur",00:33:01.470,00:33:05.240
after this.,00:33:05.240,00:33:05.960
"We're not talking about things
like S sub n plus 1, which is",00:33:05.960,00:33:10.550
"the time of the next arrival,
because that's this arrival",00:33:10.550,00:33:16.310
"time plus that next
inter-arrival time.",00:33:16.310,00:33:23.950
"So each of these intervals
are in fact",00:33:23.950,00:33:27.870
independent of each other.,00:33:27.870,00:33:29.500
"And what we've done here is use
this idea of a stopping",00:33:29.500,00:33:33.850
"trial not to define when we stop
this whole process, but",00:33:33.850,00:33:39.700
"to define when a
renewal occurs.",00:33:39.700,00:33:41.810
"In other words, we're using
it to define when the old",00:33:41.810,00:33:45.950
"inter-renewal period ends
and a new one begins.",00:33:45.950,00:33:50.230
"This can be called a stopping
trial, if in fact you stop the",00:33:50.230,00:33:56.640
"whole process at that
point and then",00:33:56.640,00:33:58.820
don't do anything further.,00:33:58.820,00:34:00.890
"So that's what's nice about this
idea of stopping trials.",00:34:00.890,00:34:05.710
"They let you not only
do Wald's equality.",00:34:05.710,00:34:08.940
"But they also let you actually
see why it is that these",00:34:08.940,00:34:14.239
"arrivals that start after this
point are independent of the",00:34:14.239,00:34:18.719
"arrivals and departures
before that.",00:34:18.719,00:34:20.940
"So let me just try to
say that again.",00:34:24.639,00:34:28.100
"The stopping rule is the index
of the first arrival in a new",00:34:28.100,00:34:32.480
busy period.,00:34:32.480,00:34:33.880
"The arrivals and departures
in the new busy period are",00:34:33.880,00:34:36.510
"independent and identically
distributed to",00:34:36.510,00:34:39.540
those in the old.,00:34:39.540,00:34:41.500
"Thus the intervals between
new busy periods",00:34:41.500,00:34:44.350
form a renewal process.,00:34:44.350,00:34:46.350
"And that's the thing that
we're going to use in",00:34:46.350,00:34:48.570
everything else we do here.,00:34:48.570,00:34:51.460
"So we have one renewal process,
which is embedded in",00:34:51.460,00:34:54.449
another renewable process.,00:34:54.449,00:34:57.760
"The outside renewal process of
the arrivals are what you",00:34:57.760,00:35:03.770
start out with.,00:35:03.770,00:35:05.510
"These embedded renewals are, in
fact, functions of both the",00:35:05.510,00:35:11.410
"arrival process and the
service distribution.",00:35:11.410,00:35:15.680
"So that's a more complicated
thing.",00:35:15.680,00:35:18.250
"But at least you now know that
that's an arrival process.",00:35:18.250,00:35:21.970
"It says that you can analyze
any one of these queuing",00:35:21.970,00:35:26.230
"systems or any considerably
broader type of queueing",00:35:26.230,00:35:31.420
"system, which has the same
property of having renewals",00:35:31.420,00:35:34.860
"every once in a while, by
looking at what happens within",00:35:34.860,00:35:38.730
a renewal period.,00:35:38.730,00:35:40.260
"Then using what happens within
a renewal period and applying",00:35:40.260,00:35:44.080
"one of these limit theorems on
the embedded renewals to get",00:35:44.080,00:35:48.010
"some time average
overall time.",00:35:48.010,00:35:50.510
"So that's what we're
really up to here.",00:35:50.510,00:35:54.590
"This same analysis
applies to G/G/m.",00:35:54.590,00:35:58.280
"Applies to lots of
queueing systems.",00:35:58.280,00:36:01.310
"You have to look at a
queuing system and",00:36:01.310,00:36:03.630
see whether it applies.,00:36:03.630,00:36:05.760
"To get some idea of how you
can see that without going",00:36:05.760,00:36:10.710
"through this whole analysis,
suppose that you decided to",00:36:10.710,00:36:16.040
"try to call this point here,
at which the system first",00:36:16.040,00:36:22.080
"became empty the end of
a renewal period.",00:36:22.080,00:36:26.470
Why couldn't you do that?,00:36:26.470,00:36:27.740
"Why is this not a
renewal period?",00:36:35.060,00:36:37.690
"Well, is it a stopping trial?",00:36:45.310,00:36:48.300
"It certainly isn't a stopping
trial for the X's.",00:36:48.300,00:36:53.060
"Because at this time when this
last departure has left, you",00:36:53.060,00:36:58.840
"have no idea how long this new
inter-arrival period that's",00:36:58.840,00:37:03.360
going on here is going to be.,00:37:03.360,00:37:06.050
"That has some arbitrary
distribution.",00:37:06.050,00:37:08.060
"All we know at this point is
that it's longer than this.",00:37:08.060,00:37:12.620
"And if you had a busy period end
at some point close to the",00:37:12.620,00:37:17.860
"beginning of this inter-arrival
period, you have",00:37:17.860,00:37:20.980
"a different distribution from
when it occurs close to the",00:37:20.980,00:37:25.180
"end of an inter-arrival
period.",00:37:25.180,00:37:27.050
"Well, because these
inter-arrivals are not",00:37:30.540,00:37:33.540
memoryless.,00:37:33.540,00:37:35.150
"They have memory which says
their conditional distribution",00:37:35.150,00:37:40.250
"depends on how long they've
been running.",00:37:40.250,00:37:43.450
"So this is the only sensible
place you can define a renewal",00:37:43.450,00:37:52.740
process here.,00:37:52.740,00:37:53.990
So let's go on.,00:38:02.540,00:38:05.140
"There is something called
Little's theorem, which was",00:38:05.140,00:38:08.880
"invented by John Little
not all that long ago.",00:38:08.880,00:38:13.270
"And Little's theorem is curious,
because you can view",00:38:13.270,00:38:17.060
"it as being either trivial
or non-trivial.",00:38:17.060,00:38:22.020
"I will try to convince you that
it's trivial and also",00:38:22.020,00:38:25.560
"convince you that it's
non-trivial.",00:38:25.560,00:38:28.950
"And what I mean by that is that
it's trivial in terms of",00:38:28.950,00:38:32.870
trying to use it someplace.,00:38:32.870,00:38:36.040
"It's then nontrivial to try
to justify that you",00:38:36.040,00:38:38.970
can actually do that.,00:38:38.970,00:38:40.960
"But you get the idea of doing
it in many, many places.",00:38:40.960,00:38:46.070
"We're going to assume an arrival
at time 0, like we've",00:38:46.070,00:38:48.700
been doing before.,00:38:48.700,00:38:50.800
"Service process can be
almost anything.",00:38:50.800,00:38:53.780
"But let's assume a G/G/1
queue to be specific.",00:38:53.780,00:38:56.530
"The system empties out
eventually with probability 1.",00:38:59.230,00:39:03.240
"And assume that it restarts
on the next arrival.",00:39:03.240,00:39:05.220
"We've seen that intervals
between restarting form a",00:39:08.180,00:39:11.560
"renewal process for
the G/G/1 queue.",00:39:11.560,00:39:14.850
"And we've argued that it forms
a renewal process for an even",00:39:14.850,00:39:18.820
broader class of queues.,00:39:18.820,00:39:20.235
That's normally.,00:39:22.930,00:39:24.670
"Who can tell me when you don't
get a renewal process when you",00:39:24.670,00:39:33.340
have a G/G/1 queue?,00:39:33.340,00:39:35.650
"We made an assumption
here without talking",00:39:35.650,00:39:40.470
at all about it.,00:39:40.470,00:39:43.640
And what's that assumption?,00:39:43.640,00:39:46.770
What?,00:39:46.770,00:39:47.246
"AUDIENCE: Starting with
an empty queue.",00:39:47.246,00:39:50.380
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:39:50.380,00:39:51.010
"Every once in a while, you
get an empty queue.",00:39:51.010,00:39:53.830
"If you have a system where
service times are greater than",00:39:53.830,00:40:01.960
"inter-arrival times, what's
going to happen is that",00:40:01.960,00:40:05.330
"arrivals keep coming
in, eventually",00:40:05.330,00:40:08.310
building up more and more.,00:40:08.310,00:40:10.090
"The queue gets longer
and longer.",00:40:10.090,00:40:13.690
"And you never have any
renewals occurring.",00:40:13.690,00:40:18.600
"So one thing we didn't say here
is we're talking about",00:40:18.600,00:40:21.950
"G/G/1 queues and more general
queues, and the more important",00:40:21.950,00:40:25.950
"case where the queue sometimes
empty out.",00:40:25.950,00:40:30.180
"We want to use this to
analyze when they",00:40:30.180,00:40:32.870
actually do empty out.,00:40:32.870,00:40:34.580
So here's the picture.,00:40:37.560,00:40:40.650
"The same kind of picture as
before of an arrival process.",00:40:40.650,00:40:44.636
"And every time we're talking
about these kinds of things,",00:40:47.270,00:40:49.880
"these queuing situations, we
will distinguish the arrival",00:40:49.880,00:40:54.280
"process, which is a
renewal process.",00:40:54.280,00:40:56.710
"But when we talk about the
renewal process, we'll talk",00:40:56.710,00:40:59.940
"about this renewal process which
starts on arrivals to an",00:40:59.940,00:41:04.840
empty system.,00:41:04.840,00:41:05.710
So here's a renewal.,00:41:05.710,00:41:07.280
"Here's a renewal,
and so forth.",00:41:07.280,00:41:11.430
"Suppose we look at the
difference between A",00:41:11.430,00:41:15.375
of t and D of t.,00:41:15.375,00:41:17.250
"A of t is the number of arrivals
that have come in up",00:41:17.250,00:41:21.560
"until time t, counting this
arrival at time 0.",00:41:21.560,00:41:26.220
"D of t is the number of
departures that have occurred.",00:41:26.220,00:41:29.280
What is the difference?,00:41:29.280,00:41:30.970
"The difference, L of t, is the
number of customers in the",00:41:30.970,00:41:34.910
system at time t.,00:41:34.910,00:41:36.310
"And one of the things you'd like
to be able to analyze in",00:41:38.950,00:41:41.620
"a queuing system is, what's
the distribution?",00:41:41.620,00:41:44.880
"What do you know about how
busy the queue is?",00:41:44.880,00:41:49.050
"If you build storage for 100
customers, you would like to",00:41:49.050,00:41:53.730
"know what's the likelihood
that that",00:41:53.730,00:41:56.200
storage will fill up.,00:41:56.200,00:41:58.050
"And you have to drop customers
on the floor or do whatever",00:41:58.050,00:42:01.050
"you do to customers when
the queue is full.",00:42:01.050,00:42:06.400
"So L of t is clearly something
we want to look at.",00:42:06.400,00:42:09.420
"It's the number of customers
in the system at any time.",00:42:09.420,00:42:12.820
"Not the number of customers
waiting in queue, but the",00:42:12.820,00:42:15.340
"number of customers both to
waiting in queue and being",00:42:15.340,00:42:19.410
served currently.,00:42:19.410,00:42:20.660
"We can view this as a
generalized renewal reward",00:42:24.080,00:42:27.660
"function at this point, because
this number in the",00:42:27.660,00:42:31.350
"system at any given time t, is a
function what happens within",00:42:31.350,00:42:39.230
"this inter-renewal
period here.",00:42:39.230,00:42:41.110
"It's a function of these
arrivals within this",00:42:41.110,00:42:44.090
"inter-renewal period and these
departures within this",00:42:44.090,00:42:47.380
inter-renewal period.,00:42:47.380,00:42:48.630
"So we can use renewal
reward theory.",00:42:51.330,00:42:54.700
"The total reward with an inner
renewal period is the integral",00:42:54.700,00:42:59.870
of L of tau over that period.,00:42:59.870,00:43:02.850
This is the way we found--,00:43:02.850,00:43:04.100
"Every time we looked at renewal
reward theory, we",00:43:11.010,00:43:14.250
"looked at the reward within
one inter-renewal period.",00:43:14.250,00:43:19.180
"And then we tried to look at
what happened when we started",00:43:19.180,00:43:22.530
"to look at many, many
inter-renewal periods.",00:43:22.530,00:43:25.920
"So we want to look at
L of tau integrated",00:43:25.920,00:43:29.920
over one renewal period.,00:43:29.920,00:43:32.080
"And then we want to go on to
see how we apply renewal",00:43:32.080,00:43:35.730
theory over that.,00:43:35.730,00:43:37.770
"So in each inter-renewal period,
the aggregate number",00:43:37.770,00:43:43.680
"and queue number in the system
integrated over the duration",00:43:43.680,00:43:50.370
"of that inter-renewal period is
this integral of L of tau.",00:43:50.370,00:43:55.750
"Here I've stated Little's
theorem really.",00:43:55.750,00:43:58.590
"Let's go back and see where
that comes from.",00:43:58.590,00:44:01.920
"If I want to look at the
integral of L of t over this",00:44:01.920,00:44:07.130
"period of time, what is it?",00:44:07.130,00:44:10.580
"I can view it as W1
plus W2 plus W3.",00:44:10.580,00:44:16.540
"That's the easy way to integrate
this function.",00:44:16.540,00:44:19.380
You start out here.,00:44:19.380,00:44:21.050
You're integrating up to here.,00:44:21.050,00:44:22.410
1 times D tau.,00:44:26.100,00:44:27.890
And you have 2 times D tau.,00:44:27.890,00:44:30.170
"Then 1, then 2, and
then 1 again.",00:44:30.170,00:44:34.270
"But the easy way to integrate it
is just say the integral is",00:44:34.270,00:44:37.690
"W1 plus W2 times this
height, plus W3.",00:44:37.690,00:44:41.900
"For those of you who have
studied Lebesgue integration,",00:44:44.520,00:44:48.800
"it's the idea of a Lebesgue
integral as opposed to a",00:44:48.800,00:44:52.020
Riemann integral.,00:44:52.020,00:44:53.350
"If you haven't studied it,
don't worry about it.",00:44:53.350,00:44:55.910
"It's just a trivial idea that
you can integrate this way as",00:44:55.910,00:44:59.740
well as integrating this way.,00:44:59.740,00:45:01.380
"That's the crux of
Little's theorem.",00:45:05.930,00:45:07.630
"The crux of Little's theorem is
this equality between the",00:45:07.630,00:45:13.150
"integral of L of t and the
sum of the waiting",00:45:13.150,00:45:19.520
times of each customer.,00:45:19.520,00:45:21.860
"W1 is the waiting time
of customer--",00:45:21.860,00:45:26.050
"Well it's the waiting time of
customer 0 in this case.",00:45:26.050,00:45:28.450
"W2 is the waiting time of
customer 1, from the time it",00:45:28.450,00:45:31.920
"comes in, it's waiting in
queue until this time.",00:45:31.920,00:45:35.180
Then it starts service.,00:45:35.180,00:45:36.430
Next customer comes in here.,00:45:38.980,00:45:40.860
Waits in queue.,00:45:40.860,00:45:42.010
Finally starts service.,00:45:42.010,00:45:43.380
Then the system is empty.,00:45:43.380,00:45:45.300
"And you integrate L of t
from here up to here.",00:45:45.300,00:45:49.210
You sum the W's.,00:45:49.210,00:45:51.090
"And that's what I did
in the next slide.",00:45:51.090,00:45:52.555
"And I can integrate over as many
inter-renewal periods as",00:45:58.660,00:46:02.440
you want to integrate over.,00:46:02.440,00:46:05.030
And what's going to happen?,00:46:05.030,00:46:06.610
"I'm adding up these individual
inter-renewal periods.",00:46:06.610,00:46:10.310
"I'm adding up this integral
over each of them.",00:46:10.310,00:46:13.400
"I'm also adding up the sum of
the waiting times over that",00:46:13.400,00:46:18.350
larger interval.,00:46:18.350,00:46:20.180
"And this equality
still occurs.",00:46:20.180,00:46:22.980
"Any time I integrate over
an integer number of",00:46:22.980,00:46:26.470
"inter-renewal periods, I have
this equality between the",00:46:26.470,00:46:30.130
"integral of L of t and
the sum of W sub i's.",00:46:30.130,00:46:34.690
"One of the things that we
observe from renewal theory is",00:46:34.690,00:46:38.850
"when you start taking limits
between 0 and infinity, one",00:46:38.850,00:46:43.240
"inter-renewal period doesn't
make any difference.",00:46:43.240,00:46:47.100
"When we go on through the
mathematics there, we've done",00:46:47.100,00:46:49.380
it carefully.,00:46:49.380,00:46:50.080
We've upper bound it.,00:46:50.080,00:46:51.460
And we've lower bound it.,00:46:51.460,00:46:52.900
"And we've then shown that it
doesn't make any difference.",00:46:52.900,00:46:56.930
"But at this point, you know
that it doesn't make any",00:46:56.930,00:46:59.080
difference.,00:46:59.080,00:47:01.690
"So that you know that when you
take the time average, the",00:47:01.690,00:47:08.210
"time average number in the
system is equal to the limit",00:47:08.210,00:47:12.910
"as t goes to infinity of 1 over
t times i equals 1 up to",00:47:12.910,00:47:18.740
"the number of arrivals up until
time t times W sub i.",00:47:18.740,00:47:23.970
"When you take that limit, it's
W sub i over A of t times the",00:47:23.970,00:47:28.630
limit of A of t over t.,00:47:28.630,00:47:32.340
"Both of these go to a limit with
probability 1, because",00:47:32.340,00:47:36.840
"this is just a strong law
of large numbers again.",00:47:36.840,00:47:40.390
"This is just the renewal
theorem again.",00:47:40.390,00:47:43.890
"And that limit here is the
time average of W. It's a",00:47:43.890,00:47:50.890
"little awkward calling
this a time average.",00:47:50.890,00:47:54.000
"Because what this really is
is a sample path average.",00:47:54.000,00:47:58.670
"That's a sample path average
which exists",00:47:58.670,00:48:00.910
with probability 1.,00:48:00.910,00:48:02.540
"This is a sample path every over
any old sample path you",00:48:02.540,00:48:06.880
"want to look at of the time
average over all of the",00:48:06.880,00:48:12.420
customers that come in.,00:48:12.420,00:48:13.580
"You add up all the customers
that come in and you divide by",00:48:13.580,00:48:17.800
the number of customers.,00:48:17.800,00:48:19.220
"And that gives you the time
average delay that a customer",00:48:19.220,00:48:25.000
experiences.,00:48:25.000,00:48:26.160
"So what Little's theorem says
is that the time average of",00:48:26.160,00:48:30.640
"the expected number of customers
in the system at a",00:48:30.640,00:48:34.090
"given time is equal to lambda,
which is the arrival rate--",00:48:34.090,00:48:38.595
"A of t over t, is
arrival rate--",00:48:38.595,00:48:41.620
"times the expected delay that
each customer experiences.",00:48:41.620,00:48:44.090
"That's a very useful
relationship.",00:48:48.290,00:48:50.990
"Like all of the things that come
from the Wald equality,",00:48:50.990,00:48:58.760
"it only gives you a relationship
between two",00:48:58.760,00:49:01.080
things that you don't know.,00:49:01.080,00:49:04.460
"But one relationship between two
things you don't know is",00:49:04.460,00:49:07.580
"better than no relationships
between two",00:49:07.580,00:49:10.290
things you don't know.,00:49:10.290,00:49:12.050
"Here we have this one
useful relationship.",00:49:12.050,00:49:15.470
"We can understand intuitively
what's going on here if we",00:49:15.470,00:49:21.420
look this diagram again.,00:49:21.420,00:49:23.135
"If you look at the diagram
again, if you expand this",00:49:39.130,00:49:46.460
"whole diagram in t, if you
measure it in hours instead of",00:49:46.460,00:49:53.540
"measuring it in milliseconds,
for example.",00:49:53.540,00:49:56.410
"This whole thing spreads
out enormously.",00:49:56.410,00:49:59.410
And what happens?,00:49:59.410,00:50:00.750
"The W's all get multiplied
by a very large amount.",00:50:00.750,00:50:06.170
A of tau stays the same.,00:50:06.170,00:50:10.310
"Lambda, the expected
arrival rate,",00:50:10.310,00:50:13.210
becomes very much larger.,00:50:13.210,00:50:14.890
"Arrivals per hour rather than
arrivals per millisecond.",00:50:14.890,00:50:21.090
"So you see that at least as
far as scaling is scaling,",00:50:21.090,00:50:34.340
"there's no way of relating this
to this without having",00:50:34.340,00:50:38.050
"something there, which is
something per unit time.",00:50:38.050,00:50:41.890
This is time.,00:50:41.890,00:50:43.070
This is a time average.,00:50:43.070,00:50:47.790
So we have Little's theorem.,00:50:47.790,00:50:50.900
"Useful in many, many
situations.",00:50:50.900,00:50:54.340
"It's useful as an approximation
in many places",00:50:54.340,00:50:56.910
where it doesn't hold.,00:50:56.910,00:50:58.160
"But the right way to look at
this, this is really an",00:51:01.650,00:51:05.840
accounting identity.,00:51:05.840,00:51:07.420
"There was this first thing
we brought out, that this",00:51:07.420,00:51:10.400
"integral of L of t over 1
inter-renewal period was equal",00:51:10.400,00:51:19.100
"to the sum of the waiting
times over",00:51:19.100,00:51:20.850
that one renewal period.,00:51:20.850,00:51:23.670
"All of the mathematics and all
of the stuff we've been",00:51:23.670,00:51:26.460
"struggling with have all been
concerned with showing that",00:51:26.460,00:51:31.160
"when you go to the limit as t
goes to infinity, all of these",00:51:31.160,00:51:37.760
things make sense.,00:51:37.760,00:51:39.320
"Question is not whether L equals
lambda W, but whether",00:51:39.320,00:51:42.900
"these quantities exist as
sensible time averages or is",00:51:42.900,00:51:46.860
limiting ensemble averages.,00:51:46.860,00:51:48.690
"What we're dealing with
now is time averages.",00:51:48.690,00:51:52.130

same things with limiting",00:51:52.130,00:51:55.430

as the simplest",00:56:23.610,00:56:26.810
answer to your question.,00:56:26.810,00:56:29.420

in trouble.,00:56:40.620,00:56:41.700
"If that's less than 1, normally",00:56:41.700,00:56:43.260
you're not in trouble.,00:56:43.260,00:56:44.990
"This formula says it's something
worse than that.",00:56:44.990,00:56:49.940

"We get that from this by using
Little's relationship.",00:58:07.220,00:58:11.420

system is lambda squared times",00:58:11.420,00:58:14.570
"V squared bar over 2
times 1 minus rho.",00:58:14.570,00:58:20.560

get lambda V bar,",00:58:26.740,00:58:29.150

the same amount of",00:59:11.940,00:59:14.350

"V bar squared is a second moment
of the service time.",00:59:19.620,00:59:22.780

we had before.",00:59:26.490,00:59:28.245

times V bar.",00:59:40.650,00:59:46.450

V bar squared over 2",00:59:46.450,00:59:50.240
times 1 minus rho.,00:59:50.240,00:59:52.260
"You look at exponential
inter-arrivals, suddenly you",00:59:52.260,00:59:57.190
"get twice as much
wait in queue.",00:59:57.190,01:00:00.460

service times than",01:00:00.460,01:00:07.780
"it is to have Fx deterministic
service times.",01:00:07.780,01:00:13.300
"If you look at this strange kind
of distribution we talked",01:00:13.300,01:00:16.950

1 minus rho.",01:00:43.490,01:00:46.010

behavior we had before.",01:00:46.010,01:00:48.960
"You have an enormous
residual life.",01:00:48.960,01:00:51.540
"And therefore, the time that
you wait for a customer in",01:00:51.540,01:00:54.900
"service to get finished
is very, very large.",01:00:54.900,01:00:59.100
"It's what you notice all the
time if you're waiting in some",01:00:59.100,01:01:05.970

of the customers",01:01:05.970,01:01:10.780
get very rapid service.,01:01:10.780,01:01:12.680
"And every once in while,
there's a disaster.",01:01:12.680,01:01:15.600

airline, when you've missed",01:01:15.600,01:01:20.610
your plane or something.,01:01:20.610,01:01:22.140
"And you go up to
a booth there.",01:01:22.140,01:01:24.860

just a matter of",01:01:24.860,01:01:27.560
printing them out a ticket.,01:01:27.560,01:01:29.040
"They're done in 20

a customer who",01:01:31.600,01:01:34.110
has enormous problems.,01:01:34.110,01:01:36.830

them to be served.",01:01:36.830,01:01:40.100
"That's exactly this
situation here.",01:01:40.100,01:01:42.790

waiting time in q, before you",01:01:42.790,01:01:47.010

service time is very, very",01:02:15.820,01:02:21.710

"This term here is a separate
kind of term.",01:02:33.980,01:02:38.220
"And this has to do simply with
a service time distribution",01:02:38.220,01:02:42.200
"that says that bad service time
distributions affect you",01:02:42.200,01:02:46.580
"in exactly the same way,
no matter what",01:02:46.580,01:02:49.880
the duty factor is.,01:02:49.880,01:02:51.850

between these two",01:02:51.850,01:02:54.580

the way it is.",01:02:54.580,01:02:57.640

what this has to be.,01:04:28.610,01:04:29.680
I have these triangles here.,01:04:29.680,01:04:31.580
I have this idle time here.,01:04:31.580,01:04:34.050
How much idle time is there?,01:04:34.050,01:04:35.530
"How much triangle
time is there?",01:04:35.530,01:04:39.160
"The triangles are these one half
V sub i's that we're used",01:04:39.160,01:04:43.230
to from before.,01:04:43.230,01:04:45.460
"And then this empty time here
is a 1 minus rho term.",01:04:45.460,01:04:50.740
"It's 1 minus the duty factor
of the system.",01:04:50.740,01:04:54.630
"And that's the amount of time
over a very long period of",01:04:54.630,01:04:57.370
"time, the fraction of time,
that the system is empty.",01:04:57.370,01:05:01.765
"That fraction has to be 1 minus
rho, because the system",01:05:01.765,01:05:05.370
is busy with fraction rho.,01:05:05.370,01:05:07.375
"It's empty with fraction
1 minus rho.",01:05:07.375,01:05:09.830
"So you can write down the answer
to this without really",01:05:09.830,01:05:14.360
"having much of a justification
for it.",01:05:14.360,01:05:17.175
"So now we want to figure out
why this is what it is.",01:05:22.570,01:05:27.785
This is all right.,01:05:43.070,01:05:45.490
"I want to take the limit as tau
goes to infinity of this",01:05:45.490,01:05:48.890
integral here over time.,01:05:48.890,01:05:52.470
"And what that is going
to be is 1 over tau.",01:05:52.470,01:05:56.980
"And what this is is an analytic
way of finding that",01:05:56.980,01:06:00.900
"factor of 1 minus rho
that I really",01:06:00.900,01:06:05.840
didn't talk about before.,01:06:05.840,01:06:07.870
"So this integral here, if I look
at it out to A of tau, is",01:06:07.870,01:06:13.610
"going to be 1 over tau times
the sum of all of these",01:06:13.610,01:06:18.480
"triangles here up to the number
of customers which have",01:06:18.480,01:06:22.950
arrived up until time tau.,01:06:22.950,01:06:25.070
"So I have all of these out to
time tau, which is going to be",01:06:25.070,01:06:29.190
out here now.,01:06:29.190,01:06:30.330
So I sum all of these up.,01:06:30.330,01:06:33.510
"And now I ask the question, what
is that sum going to be",01:06:33.510,01:06:38.900
"and the limit as tau
goes to infinity?",01:06:38.900,01:06:42.210
"Well, we know how to evaluate
that kind of thing, because",01:06:42.210,01:06:46.810
"we've done it four or
five times already.",01:06:46.810,01:06:50.960
"The limit as tau goes to
infinity of 1 over tau times",01:06:50.960,01:07:02.560
"the summation from i equals
1 to A of tau Vi",01:07:02.560,01:07:10.520
squared divided by 2.,01:07:10.520,01:07:18.030
"You can write this as limit of A
of tau over tau times 1 over",01:07:18.030,01:07:37.180
"A of tau times the sum
from i equals 1",01:07:37.180,01:07:41.975
to A of tau Vi squared.,01:07:41.975,01:07:47.070
"Now as tau increases, this A of
tau is going to increase.",01:07:47.070,01:07:52.890
"These are IID random
variables.",01:07:52.890,01:07:55.690
"So what we're doing is
increasing the sample average",01:07:55.690,01:08:00.180
of these IID random variables.,01:08:00.180,01:08:02.640
So this quantity goes to what?,01:08:02.640,01:08:08.200
"It goes to the expected value of
V squared by the strong law",01:08:08.200,01:08:19.939
of large numbers.,01:08:19.939,01:08:21.189
"And what does this
quantity go to?",01:08:24.340,01:08:28.250
"A of tau over tau, that's
the number of",01:08:28.250,01:08:30.630
arrivals per unit time.,01:08:30.630,01:08:33.170
And that goes to lambda.,01:08:33.170,01:08:36.054
Is that what I got there?,01:08:36.054,01:08:38.060
I forgot this 2 here.,01:08:42.460,01:08:44.170
"So that goes 1/2 expected
value of V squared.",01:08:47.800,01:08:53.010
"So this is the careful way of
doing it, where you bring all",01:08:53.010,01:08:56.200
"of this enormous power to bear
for something that you could",01:08:56.200,01:09:00.279
"intuit without using
any of the power.",01:09:00.279,01:09:02.690
And what is W sub q then?,01:09:05.649,01:09:08.600
"What is the average time
we spend in the queue?",01:09:08.600,01:09:13.850
"Well you have two components
of time you",01:09:13.850,01:09:16.370
spend in the queue.,01:09:16.370,01:09:17.819
"If you arrive when the server is
busy, you're going to have",01:09:17.819,01:09:23.359
"to wait this residual lifetime,
which is the",01:09:23.359,01:09:27.910
"expected value of r, which
is residual life.",01:09:27.910,01:09:32.350
"The other thing you're going
to have to wait for is for",01:09:32.350,01:09:35.330
"every customer in the
queue to be served.",01:09:35.330,01:09:39.350
Now how long does that take?,01:09:39.350,01:09:42.120
"Well here you have to be quite
careful, because you have a",01:09:42.120,01:09:47.410
"number of customers that have
been built up in the queue.",01:09:47.410,01:09:51.210
"Each customer that's in the
queue has a service time",01:09:51.210,01:09:54.910
associated with it.,01:09:54.910,01:09:57.450
Think of a customer.,01:09:57.450,01:09:58.590
"When it comes in, it's given a
little packet with its service",01:09:58.590,01:10:02.580
time in it.,01:10:02.580,01:10:04.900
"So you look at the sum
of all those terms.",01:10:04.900,01:10:09.240
"The question is, is the expected
number in the queue",01:10:09.240,01:10:15.990
"independent of the service
time of the",01:10:15.990,01:10:19.150
customers in the queue?,01:10:19.150,01:10:20.400
"And how do you reason
that out?",01:10:23.370,01:10:24.940
"And at this point, you really
don't want to reason it out in",01:10:28.070,01:10:30.780
"terms of writing a
lot of equations.",01:10:30.780,01:10:32.770
"You want to just
think about it.",01:10:32.770,01:10:35.910
"How does a queueing system work,
if you have a first come",01:10:35.910,01:10:39.320
first served queuing system?,01:10:39.320,01:10:41.680
Customers come in.,01:10:41.680,01:10:44.810
"Each of them has a certain
amount of time to be served,",01:10:44.810,01:10:48.710
"which it's holding in a little
bag at its side, but which",01:10:48.710,01:10:53.050
nobody else sees.,01:10:53.050,01:10:54.910
"And these are independent,
random variables.",01:10:54.910,01:10:57.740
"But when it comes in, there
are a certain number of",01:10:57.740,01:11:01.210
"customers in the queue
in front of it.",01:11:01.210,01:11:03.210
"So the number of customers that
are in the queue before",01:11:06.730,01:11:09.700
"it each have their own service
times sitting in their own",01:11:09.700,01:11:12.770
little pockets.,01:11:12.770,01:11:14.970
"So the amount of time that it
takes for me to be served is",01:11:14.970,01:11:22.520
"this sum of all of the
previous times.",01:11:22.520,01:11:25.650
"And all these previous
times are",01:11:25.650,01:11:27.650
"independent, random variables.",01:11:27.650,01:11:29.630
"And each of them are independent
of how many",01:11:29.630,01:11:32.010
"customers are in the queue
at the time they arrive.",01:11:32.010,01:11:35.725
"So what I'm trying to argue is
that the number of customers",01:11:38.520,01:11:42.180
"in the queue at time t are
independent of the service",01:11:42.180,01:11:47.900
"time of each of those customers,
because the service",01:11:47.900,01:11:52.420
"times are not apparent to the
system until a person getting",01:11:52.420,01:11:57.130
"into service takes it out of his
pocket and looks at what",01:11:57.130,01:11:59.730
his service time is.,01:11:59.730,01:12:02.130
"And that's unknown
to the system",01:12:02.130,01:12:04.410
until the service starts.,01:12:04.410,01:12:07.340
"So when you take N q bar
independent of V bar0--",01:12:07.340,01:12:12.640
"Incidentally, if you read the
notes, this is explained in a",01:12:12.640,01:12:15.110
"slightly more mathematical than
customers having little",01:12:15.110,01:12:19.640
pockets which they read.,01:12:19.640,01:12:21.950
"But it doesn't help
a whole lot.",01:12:21.950,01:12:25.440
"But anyway, when you go through
that argument, you",01:12:25.440,01:12:28.520
then get this expression.,01:12:28.520,01:12:31.030
"And then you add a
little Little.",01:12:31.030,01:12:34.010
"Namely a little Little's
theorem, which says that N sub",01:12:34.010,01:12:37.430
"q is equal to lambda
times W sub q.",01:12:37.430,01:12:41.400
"So you can take this over
on the other side.",01:12:41.400,01:12:45.850
"And this gives you lambda
V squared over 2,",01:12:45.850,01:12:50.090
which is this term.,01:12:50.090,01:12:52.430
"And at the same time,
you get 1 over--",01:12:52.430,01:12:55.870
Excuse me.,01:12:59.790,01:13:00.880
"Lambda V squared over
2 is this term.",01:13:00.880,01:13:05.290
"And W q minus N q V bar is
1 minus is W q times 1--",01:13:05.290,01:13:15.540
I'll do it at the board.,01:13:15.540,01:13:18.490
Probably I'll see it.,01:13:18.490,01:13:19.570
"But W sub q is equal to lambda
V squared over 2.",01:13:19.570,01:13:33.820
"That's the expected value of
r plus lambda W sub Q bar.",01:13:33.820,01:13:42.700
"So we take this over
on this side.",01:13:42.700,01:13:45.840
"And then we get W q bar equals
lambda V squared over 2 times",01:13:45.840,01:13:57.930
1 over 1 minus lambda.,01:13:57.930,01:14:00.445
1 minus lambda V bar.,01:14:06.430,01:14:08.710
Where did the V bar come from?,01:14:08.710,01:14:10.850
Beats me.,01:14:10.850,01:14:11.926
"Oh, came from this
quantity there.",01:14:11.926,01:14:16.430
"Let's patch up our lambda
V bar times W sub q bar.",01:14:16.430,01:14:29.430
So now we get lambda V bar.,01:14:29.430,01:14:32.396
"That is all I had
to say today.",01:14:36.700,01:14:39.790
And so have any questions?,01:14:39.790,01:14:42.200
