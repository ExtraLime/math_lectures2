ANA BELL: OK.,00:00:23.473,00:00:24.014
We have our class.,00:00:27.330,00:00:30.570
"We've done pretty much
everything up until here,",00:00:30.570,00:00:35.730
"and we're going to add
this special function here.",00:00:35.730,00:00:40.480
"So we're implementing
this underscore underscore",00:00:40.480,00:00:42.480
eq underscore underscore.,00:00:42.480,00:00:45.650
"And implementing this
is going to allow us",00:00:45.650,00:00:49.700
to compare two types of cars.,00:00:49.700,00:00:51.990
"So the way I've decided to
compare two types of cars",00:00:55.200,00:00:57.570
"is I'm saying the
two cars are going",00:00:57.570,00:01:00.180
"to be equal if they have
the same number of wheels,",00:01:00.180,00:01:02.370
"they have the same
color, and if they",00:01:02.370,00:01:03.911
have the same number of doors.,00:01:03.911,00:01:08.542
OK?,00:01:08.542,00:01:09.410
"So if all of these are
equal, then return true",00:01:09.410,00:01:13.540
and else return false.,00:01:13.540,00:01:14.665
"Inside the actual
program here, I'm",00:01:18.440,00:01:20.390
"creating one car, four
wheels, two doors.",00:01:20.390,00:01:23.300
I'm changing its color to red.,00:01:23.300,00:01:25.280
"I'm creating another car--
four wheels, two doors.",00:01:25.280,00:01:29.420
"By default, this new
car, or your car,",00:01:29.420,00:01:33.020
"is going to have the
color empty string,",00:01:33.020,00:01:34.850
"because that's how a new
car gets initialized, right?",00:01:34.850,00:01:38.610
"So between my car and
your car, the difference",00:01:41.640,00:01:44.810
is going to be the color.,00:01:44.810,00:01:46.020
OK?,00:01:46.020,00:01:46.760
"So the color is not
going to be the same,",00:01:46.760,00:01:48.035
"but they have the
same number of wheels",00:01:48.035,00:01:49.280
and the same number of doors.,00:01:49.280,00:01:50.488
"So because I implemented
the equal method in my code,",00:01:52.810,00:01:57.220
this does not throw an error.,00:01:57.220,00:01:59.200
This lets me proceed.,00:01:59.200,00:02:00.580
"It compares four with
four, which is good,",00:02:00.580,00:02:03.000
"two with two, which is good.",00:02:03.000,00:02:04.250
"And then the colors
don't match, so it's",00:02:04.250,00:02:06.100
"going to say false,
which most of the guys",00:02:06.100,00:02:09.479
are getting it right.,00:02:09.479,00:02:11.133
