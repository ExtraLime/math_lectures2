PROFESSOR: Hi there.,00:00:07.065,00:00:07.920
Welcome back to recitation.,00:00:07.920,00:00:09.540
"In lecture, you've been learning
about when vectors are linearly",00:00:09.540,00:00:12.870
"independent, when they span
the space, what a basis is,",00:00:12.870,00:00:17.550
"what a dimension of
a vector space is.",00:00:17.550,00:00:19.790
"And the problem for today
is exactly about that.",00:00:19.790,00:00:23.630
"We have a vector
space that is given.",00:00:23.630,00:00:26.500
"It's spanned by
these four vectors.",00:00:26.500,00:00:28.780
"And we're asked to find the
dimension of that vector space",00:00:28.780,00:00:32.009
and the basis for it.,00:00:32.009,00:00:33.190
"Well, why don't you hit pause
on the video, and work on it",00:00:35.700,00:00:39.270
for a while.,00:00:39.270,00:00:39.770
"And I'll come back in a little
bit to help you out with it.",00:00:39.770,00:00:42.510
We're back.,00:00:51.120,00:00:51.900
Let's work on it.,00:00:51.900,00:00:54.900
"So we need to find the
dimension and the basis.",00:00:54.900,00:01:00.310
Remember what the dimension is?,00:01:00.310,00:01:01.970
"It's simply the
number of vectors",00:01:01.970,00:01:03.570
in a basis for the vector space.,00:01:03.570,00:01:05.590
"So actually, the
problem is backwards.",00:01:05.590,00:01:07.680
"We want to find the
basis for the space",00:01:07.680,00:01:09.460
"first, and then
find the dimension.",00:01:09.460,00:01:11.840
"I'll write ""first""
here and ""second"" here.",00:01:11.840,00:01:19.700
"So we want to find a basis
for the vector space spanned",00:01:19.700,00:01:22.270
by these four vectors.,00:01:22.270,00:01:24.040
"So you might be
tempted to just say",00:01:24.040,00:01:26.040
"that a basis for
this vector space",00:01:26.040,00:01:27.680
"is those four vectors, because
they span the vector space.",00:01:27.680,00:01:31.410
"But there's another thing
that a basis has to satisfy.",00:01:31.410,00:01:34.350
"And it is the elements
of the basis have",00:01:34.350,00:01:36.920
to be linearly independent.,00:01:36.920,00:01:38.760
We don't know that these are.,00:01:38.760,00:01:40.340
So we have to check.,00:01:40.340,00:01:42.636
"How do we check
that four vectors",00:01:42.636,00:01:44.010
are linearly independent?,00:01:44.010,00:01:45.670
"Well, there's a couple
of different ways.",00:01:45.670,00:01:47.800
"But here's what
we're going to do.",00:01:47.800,00:01:50.610
"We're going to put these
vectors as rows of a matrix.",00:01:50.610,00:01:54.340
And then we'll do elimination.,00:01:54.340,00:01:57.070
"And when we get to the end,
the rows that have pivots",00:01:57.070,00:02:00.710
are the independent ones.,00:02:00.710,00:02:02.570
So let's do that.,00:02:02.570,00:02:04.220
"1, 1, -2, 0, -1; 1, 2, 0, -4, 1;
0, 1, 3, -3, 2; 2, 3, 0, -2, 0.",00:02:06.760,00:02:25.740
"By now you must have done
elimination a million times,",00:02:30.480,00:02:32.730
so I'll go a little bit faster.,00:02:32.730,00:02:36.310
"1, 1, -2, 0, -1; 0,
1, 0, +2, -4, 2--",00:02:36.310,00:02:48.864
"this one's already done-- 1,
3, -3, 2; 2 minus 2, 3 minus 2,",00:02:48.864,00:02:56.670
"0 plus 4, -2, and 2.",00:02:56.670,00:03:02.170
One more step.,00:03:05.457,00:03:06.040
"1, 1, -2, 0, -1-- all these
are done-- 0, 1, 2, -4, 2; 0,",00:03:08.740,00:03:21.146
"1 minus 1 is 0, 3 minus 2 is 1,
-3 plus 4 is 1, 2 minus 2 is 0,",00:03:21.146,00:03:30.491
"1 minus 1 is 0,
2, 2 again, and 0.",00:03:30.491,00:03:37.402
"Well, you can see
where this is going.",00:03:37.402,00:03:39.280
"In the next step, this
row is going to disappear.",00:03:39.280,00:03:41.760
"1, 1, -2, 0 -1; 0, 1, 2, -4, 2;
0, 0, 1, 1, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.",00:03:44.748,00:03:59.120
All right.,00:03:59.120,00:03:59.954
We're done with elimination.,00:03:59.954,00:04:01.120
So let's circle our pivots.,00:04:03.890,00:04:05.300
"All right, here are our pivots.",00:04:08.934,00:04:10.470
We have three pivots.,00:04:10.470,00:04:14.040
"And so these three rows
are linearly independent.",00:04:14.040,00:04:17.340
"And in fact, these rows
still span the same space",00:04:19.950,00:04:24.140
that the initial four rows did.,00:04:24.140,00:04:25.801
"Because when you do elimination,
all that you're doing",00:04:25.801,00:04:28.050
"is recombining
your rows by doing",00:04:28.050,00:04:31.380
linear combinations of them.,00:04:31.380,00:04:32.560
"So, for example, your first
row stayed the same throughout.",00:04:32.560,00:04:36.310
"Your second row was replaced
by row 2 minus row 1.",00:04:36.310,00:04:41.850
"But it's really still
spanning the same space.",00:04:41.850,00:04:45.310
And it goes on.,00:04:45.310,00:04:46.330
"And then the fourth row,
it turns out, was useless.",00:04:46.330,00:04:48.640
You only needed the first three.,00:04:48.640,00:04:50.590
"So the elements for a basis--
well, it will be these three.",00:04:50.590,00:04:57.295
So let me write that.,00:04:57.295,00:04:58.170
"Basis [1, 1, -2, 0, -1],
2, 2, and [0, 0, 1, 1, 0].",00:05:01.170,00:05:18.640
"Could you have used
the first three rows?",00:05:18.640,00:05:22.440
"Yes, you could.",00:05:22.440,00:05:24.230
You can't always do that.,00:05:24.230,00:05:25.640
"Sometimes in elimination,
you have to switch rows,",00:05:25.640,00:05:28.390
"because there's a 0
where a pivot should be.",00:05:28.390,00:05:30.750
"When that happens, you
have to use these three,",00:05:30.750,00:05:33.380
"or you have to keep
track of which row",00:05:33.380,00:05:35.310
"you switched to go back
and use the initial ones.",00:05:35.310,00:05:39.200
"But it's really safe
to use these ones.",00:05:39.200,00:05:41.110
"And also they're simpler than
the ones that you started with,",00:05:41.110,00:05:43.880
so why not?,00:05:43.880,00:05:45.820
"The other question
that we had was:",00:05:45.820,00:05:47.840
"what is the dimension
of the vector space?",00:05:47.840,00:05:49.740
"Well, this is the easy part.",00:05:49.740,00:05:52.780
"The dimension of the
vector space is 1, 2, 3.",00:05:52.780,00:05:58.100
And that solves the problem.,00:05:58.100,00:05:59.620
"But there's one more thing
that I want to tell you.",00:05:59.620,00:06:03.530
"I told you that there's
a couple of ways",00:06:03.530,00:06:05.210
"to find out which of
those four vectors",00:06:05.210,00:06:08.950
are linearly independent.,00:06:08.950,00:06:10.480
"And the one that I used
was I put them into rows",00:06:10.480,00:06:12.990
"and performed elimination
and picked out the rows",00:06:12.990,00:06:16.920
that have pivots on them.,00:06:16.920,00:06:19.050
"Another way to do it is to
write the initial vectors",00:06:19.050,00:06:23.380
"as columns of the matrix and
then perform elimination.",00:06:23.380,00:06:26.840
"That also works
and, as you know,",00:06:26.840,00:06:28.880
"because you're only working with
the transpose of this matrix,",00:06:28.880,00:06:31.870
"you get the same
number of pivots.",00:06:31.870,00:06:34.990
"Let's go over here where I have
the same-- well, the transpose",00:06:34.990,00:06:40.250
"of that matrix-- I
have the same vectors,",00:06:40.250,00:06:42.260
but now written as columns.,00:06:42.260,00:06:44.100
"My four initial vectors
written as columns.",00:06:44.100,00:06:46.740
"And here I have
performed elimination.",00:06:46.740,00:06:49.440
"And this is the final result.
Let me circle the pivots again.",00:06:49.440,00:06:55.466
"Here they are,
three, which is going",00:06:55.466,00:06:57.870
"to give me three linearly
independent vectors",00:06:57.870,00:07:01.210
"and hence, three elements
of the basis, and hence,",00:07:01.210,00:07:04.060
"dimension 3 for
the vector space.",00:07:04.060,00:07:06.350
"But I could no longer
use these three columns",00:07:06.350,00:07:11.040
"as elements of the basis,
because when I did elimination,",00:07:11.040,00:07:15.040
I changed the column space.,00:07:15.040,00:07:17.500
"So the column space
of this matrix",00:07:17.500,00:07:20.410
"is not the same as
the column space",00:07:20.410,00:07:22.650
of the eliminated version.,00:07:22.650,00:07:24.290
So I cannot use these.,00:07:24.290,00:07:27.410
"In fact, if you
look at them, you",00:07:27.410,00:07:29.550
"can probably understand
that they're not",00:07:29.550,00:07:31.550
"going to span the
same space as these.",00:07:31.550,00:07:34.790
"Because all that I
have down here are 0's,",00:07:34.790,00:07:37.040
"and I get a lot more than
just 0's in the last two",00:07:37.040,00:07:39.960
entries of the vectors.,00:07:39.960,00:07:41.840
"So what I need to
do is-- the pivots",00:07:41.840,00:07:45.260
"are in the first, second,
and third columns.",00:07:45.260,00:07:48.310
"I need to use these three
columns as my basis.",00:07:48.310,00:07:53.550
I'll just write basis down here.,00:07:53.550,00:07:57.420
And that will work too.,00:07:57.420,00:07:58.790
"So see, I have produced
two different bases",00:07:58.790,00:08:01.200
"for the same vector space,
which is totally fine.",00:08:01.200,00:08:04.190
"You can pick the
basis that you prefer.",00:08:04.190,00:08:06.420
All right.,00:08:06.420,00:08:07.100
We're done.,00:08:07.100,00:08:08.040
Thank you.,00:08:08.040,00:08:09.398
