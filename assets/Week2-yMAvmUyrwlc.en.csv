"&gt;&gt; DAVID J MALAN: All right,
welcome back to CS50.",00:00:10.920,00:00:14.680
This is the start of week two.,00:00:14.680,00:00:16.500
"A word from one of our
friends on campus--",00:00:16.500,00:00:18.940
"if you are interested, possibly, either
now or in some future term",00:00:18.940,00:00:22.620
"even, once more comfortable, teaching
middle school students a little",00:00:22.620,00:00:25.670
"something about computer science,
do head to that URL.",00:00:25.670,00:00:27.680
"They are in particular need right now of
teachers, particularly if you have",00:00:27.680,00:00:32.360
had some exposure to computer science.,00:00:32.360,00:00:34.700
"&gt;&gt; So recall that last time, we introduced
a few data types in C, and",00:00:34.700,00:00:38.060
"you may have started to get your
hands dirty with these thus far",00:00:38.060,00:00:40.590
in problem set one.,00:00:40.590,00:00:41.940
And we had a char.,00:00:41.940,00:00:43.230
"So in somewhat technical terms, what
is a char as you know it today?",00:00:43.230,00:00:49.100
"&gt;&gt; So it's a character, but let's
be more precise now.",00:00:49.100,00:00:51.050
"What do we mean by character
or individual char?",00:00:51.050,00:00:53.735
A non-numerical character--,00:00:56.700,00:00:59.500
so not necessarily.,00:00:59.500,00:01:00.670
"It turns out that even numbers, even
punctuation and letters are",00:01:00.670,00:01:04.580
"represented with this data
type known as a char.",00:01:04.580,00:01:06.980
So it's not necessarily alphabetical.,00:01:06.980,00:01:09.440
Yeah?,00:01:09.440,00:01:11.100
&gt;&gt; So it's an ASCII character.,00:01:11.100,00:01:12.275
"So if you think back to week zero, when
we had our byte of volunteers",00:01:12.275,00:01:15.510
"come up and either hold their hands up
or not all, they represented bits.",00:01:15.510,00:01:19.150
"But collectively as a group of eight,
they represented a byte.",00:01:19.150,00:01:22.450
"And we introduced the notion of ASCII
at that lecture, which simply is a",00:01:22.450,00:01:26.030
mapping between numbers and letters.,00:01:26.030,00:01:28.170
"And ASCII uses, as those humans
implied, eight bits",00:01:28.170,00:01:32.010
to represent a character.,00:01:32.010,00:01:33.660
"&gt;&gt; So accordingly, if eight bits can
each take on one of two values--",00:01:33.660,00:01:36.890
zero or one--,00:01:36.890,00:01:38.010
"that means there were two possibilities
for this person--",00:01:38.010,00:01:40.280
zero or one--,00:01:40.280,00:01:41.230
"two for this person, two for this
person, two for this one.",00:01:41.230,00:01:44.070
"So a total of two times two times
two times two times two--",00:01:44.070,00:01:47.450
so two the eighth in total.,00:01:47.450,00:01:49.700
"So there's a total number of characters
256 possible that you can",00:01:49.700,00:01:54.320
represent with eight bits.,00:01:54.320,00:01:55.750
"&gt;&gt; Now, those of you who speak Asian
languages might know that there's more",00:01:55.750,00:01:59.210
"characters in the world than just
As and Bs and Cs and Ds.",00:01:59.210,00:02:02.620
"And indeed, ASCII does not suffice for
a lot of languages of the world.",00:02:02.620,00:02:06.130
But more on that another time.,00:02:06.130,00:02:07.760
"For now, know that in C if you want
to represent a letter, a piece of",00:02:07.760,00:02:11.240
"punctuation, or just something character
in nature, we use a char.",00:02:11.240,00:02:15.780
And it's one byte or eight bits.,00:02:15.780,00:02:18.240
&gt;&gt; How about an int?,00:02:18.240,00:02:19.690
"Well, an int is an integer.",00:02:19.690,00:02:20.780
"How many bits, if you recall,
was an integer typically?",00:02:20.780,00:02:23.175
Anyone recall?,00:02:25.930,00:02:27.512
So it's typically 32.,00:02:27.512,00:02:29.600
"It actually depends on the computer
that you're using.",00:02:29.600,00:02:32.120
"But in the appliance, and in a lot of
computers, it's 32 bits or four",00:02:32.120,00:02:35.770
bytes-- eight times four.,00:02:35.770,00:02:37.140
"And ints are just used for storing
numbers, either negative,",00:02:37.140,00:02:39.790
"positive, or zero.",00:02:39.790,00:02:41.610
"&gt;&gt; And if you've got 32 bits and you only
care about positive numbers, can",00:02:41.610,00:02:45.250
"anyone ballpark how many possible
integers a computer can represent from",00:02:45.250,00:02:48.960
zero on up?,00:02:48.960,00:02:51.820
"So it would be two to the 32, which
is roughly four billion.",00:02:51.820,00:02:56.130
"So these powers of two are going to be
recurring themes in computer science.",00:02:56.130,00:02:59.720
"As we'll see, they're quite convenient
to work with even if it's not quite",00:02:59.720,00:03:03.930
easy to do the math in one's head.,00:03:03.930,00:03:05.790
&gt;&gt; So we'll say roughly four billion.,00:03:05.790,00:03:07.000
"Now, a long long--",00:03:07.000,00:03:08.620
you can kind of guess.,00:03:08.620,00:03:09.770
It's longer than an int.,00:03:09.770,00:03:10.480
How many bits?,00:03:10.480,00:03:12.440
So 64 bits or eight bytes.,00:03:12.440,00:03:14.250
"This just means you can represent even
bigger numbers, bigger positive or",00:03:14.250,00:03:17.480
bigger negative numbers.,00:03:17.480,00:03:19.160
&gt;&gt; And how about float?,00:03:19.160,00:03:20.060
"That's a floating point
value of 32 bits.",00:03:20.060,00:03:22.260
"This is just a real number, something
with a decimal point.",00:03:22.260,00:03:25.180
"But if you instead need more places
after the decimal point or you want to",00:03:25.180,00:03:30.100
"represent a bigger number with some
fraction after it, you can use a",00:03:30.100,00:03:33.720
"double, which is 64 bits.",00:03:33.720,00:03:36.260
"&gt;&gt; But there's an interesting
takeaway here.",00:03:36.260,00:03:38.240
"So if ints are limited by 32 bits and
even long longs are limited by 64",00:03:38.240,00:03:42.890
"bits, that sort of begs the question,
what if you actually want to count",00:03:42.890,00:03:46.180
higher than 4 billion for an int?,00:03:46.180,00:03:48.790
"Well, you just use a long long.",00:03:48.790,00:03:50.330
"But what if you want to count higher
than two to the 64th, give or take?",00:03:50.330,00:03:54.200
"&gt;&gt; Now, that's a huge number.",00:03:54.200,00:03:55.810
"But eventually, you might actually
care about these kinds of values,",00:03:55.810,00:03:59.250
"especially if you are using a database
and starting to collect lots and lots",00:03:59.250,00:04:03.070
"and lots of data and assigning unique
numbers to each piece of that data.",00:04:03.070,00:04:06.190
So we kind of have a problem.,00:04:06.190,00:04:07.430
"And similarly, with floating point
values-- floats or doubles--",00:04:07.430,00:04:10.700
"if you've only got a finite number of
bits, how many total numbers could you",00:04:10.700,00:04:14.290
possibly represent?,00:04:14.290,00:04:16.980
"&gt;&gt; Well, it's less clear when you
involve a decimal point.",00:04:16.980,00:04:19.540
But it's surely finite.,00:04:19.540,00:04:20.899
"If you have a finite number of bits,
a finite number of humans, a finite",00:04:20.899,00:04:24.390
"number of light bulbs, surely you can
only represent a finite number of",00:04:24.390,00:04:27.350
floating point values.,00:04:27.350,00:04:28.510
"But how many real numbers
are their in the world?",00:04:28.510,00:04:33.170
There's an infinite.,00:04:33.170,00:04:33.680
"So that's kind of a problem because we
don't have an infinite amount of",00:04:33.680,00:04:37.280
memory or RAM inside of our computers.,00:04:37.280,00:04:39.970
So some challenging things can happen.,00:04:39.970,00:04:41.780
"&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and try
to express this here.",00:04:41.780,00:04:43.900
Let me go ahead and open up gedit.,00:04:43.900,00:04:46.240
"I'm going to go ahead and save a file
called ""floats0.c"" just to be",00:04:46.240,00:04:50.360
"consistent with an example that is
available online, if you would like.",00:04:50.360,00:04:54.630
"And I'm going to go ahead and
define it as follows--",00:04:54.630,00:04:58.080
"I'm going to go ahead and say, int
main void, as we often do.",00:04:58.080,00:05:01.540
"&gt;&gt; And then in this program, I'm going to
declare myself a float, so a 32-bit",00:05:01.540,00:05:07.190
"variable called f, arbitrarily.",00:05:07.190,00:05:09.700
"And then I'm going to store in it
I don't know, one tenth, so 0.1.",00:05:09.700,00:05:13.910
"So I'm going to express that as one
divided by 10, which is perfectly",00:05:13.910,00:05:16.590
legitimate in C.,00:05:16.590,00:05:17.790
"&gt;&gt; And then on the second line, I simply
want to print out that value.",00:05:17.790,00:05:20.460
"So recall that we can use
the familiar printf.",00:05:20.460,00:05:22.950
We don't want to use %i for an int.,00:05:22.950,00:05:25.420
We want to use %f for a float.,00:05:25.420,00:05:28.360
"And then I'm going to do backslash n,
close quote, comma, f, semicolon.",00:05:28.360,00:05:33.080
&gt;&gt; So here's my program.,00:05:33.080,00:05:34.400
There's already one bug.,00:05:34.400,00:05:35.820
"Does someone for whom this clicked
already want to point at least",00:05:35.820,00:05:38.640
one bug I've made?,00:05:38.640,00:05:40.220
Yeah?,00:05:40.220,00:05:42.470
Yeah.,00:05:42.470,00:05:42.800
"I forgot ""#include "" at the
top, they symptom of which if I try to",00:05:42.800,00:05:47.860
"compile this is going to be that the
compiler is going to yell at me,",00:05:47.860,00:05:50.490
"saying undefined symbol or
something to that effect.",00:05:50.490,00:05:52.770
"It doesn't understand something
like printf.",00:05:52.770,00:05:55.360
"&gt;&gt; So I'm going to do ""#include
"", save the file.",00:05:55.360,00:05:59.380
And now it's in better shape.,00:05:59.380,00:06:00.400
"But I'm also going to point
out one new detail today.",00:06:00.400,00:06:02.690
"In addition to specifying place
holders like %f %i %s, you can",00:06:02.690,00:06:08.620
"sometimes influence the behavior
of that placeholder.",00:06:08.620,00:06:12.320
"For instance, in the case of a floating
point value, if I only want",00:06:12.320,00:06:15.540
"to display one decimal place after the
period, I can actually do 0.1f.",00:06:15.540,00:06:22.200
"So in other words, I separate the f and
the percent sign with 0.1, just",00:06:22.200,00:06:26.830
"telling printf, you might have a whole
bunch of numbers after the decimal",00:06:26.830,00:06:30.200
point for me.,00:06:30.200,00:06:30.930
But I only want to see one of them.,00:06:30.930,00:06:32.870
"&gt;&gt; So I'm going to go ahead now and save
this program, go into my terminal",00:06:32.870,00:06:36.280
"window, and I'm going to go ahead
and type make float 0, enter.",00:06:36.280,00:06:41.870
"I see that somewhat cryptic line that
will begin to make more sense as we",00:06:41.870,00:06:44.930
tease it apart this week and next.,00:06:44.930,00:06:46.900
"Now I'm going to go ahead
and run float zero.",00:06:46.900,00:06:50.480
"And, damn.",00:06:50.480,00:06:52.020
"&gt;&gt; So there's another bug
here for some reason.",00:06:52.020,00:06:54.880
"I'm pretty sure that one tenth, or
one divided by 10, is not 0.0.",00:06:54.880,00:07:02.490
"Maybe I'm just not looking
at enough digits.",00:07:02.490,00:07:04.590
"So why don't I say two .2 to see two
decimal places instead of just one.",00:07:04.590,00:07:08.580
"Let me go back to my terminal window
here and hit up a couple of times to",00:07:08.580,00:07:11.810
see my history.,00:07:11.810,00:07:12.840
"Do make float zero again,
and then up again.",00:07:12.840,00:07:15.910
And now enter.,00:07:15.910,00:07:17.730
&gt;&gt; And now I'm pretty sure this is wrong.,00:07:17.730,00:07:20.000
"And I could do three and four, and I'm
probably going to keep seeing zeros.",00:07:20.000,00:07:23.030
So where is the bug?,00:07:23.030,00:07:24.880
One divided by 10 should be 0.1.,00:07:24.880,00:07:27.910
"Someone want to take a stab at what
the fundamental issue is?",00:07:27.910,00:07:30.310
Yeah?,00:07:30.310,00:07:32.400
They're both integers.,00:07:32.400,00:07:33.420
So what?,00:07:33.420,00:07:33.920
"So with one divided by 10, that's
what I do in arithmetic.",00:07:33.920,00:07:37.820
And I get 0.1.,00:07:37.820,00:07:41.185
&gt;&gt; Yeah.,00:07:41.185,00:07:41.660
And so it is indeed that issue.,00:07:41.660,00:07:43.240
"When you take an integer in a computer
and you divide it by another integer,",00:07:43.240,00:07:46.700
"the computer by default is going to
assume that you want an integer.",00:07:46.700,00:07:50.430
"The problem though, of course, is
that 0.1 is not an integer.",00:07:50.430,00:07:54.620
It's a real number.,00:07:54.620,00:07:55.680
"And so what the computer does by
default is it just throws away",00:07:55.680,00:07:59.610
everything after the decimal point.,00:07:59.610,00:08:01.070
It doesn't round down or up per se.,00:08:01.070,00:08:03.380
"It just throws away everything
after the decimal point.",00:08:03.380,00:08:06.480
And now that makes sense.,00:08:06.480,00:08:07.430
"Because now we're clearly
left with zero.",00:08:07.430,00:08:09.740
&gt;&gt; But wait a minute.,00:08:09.740,00:08:10.250
I'm not seeing an int zero.,00:08:10.250,00:08:11.840
I'm actually seeing 0.00.,00:08:11.840,00:08:14.910
So how do I reconcile this now?,00:08:14.910,00:08:16.340
"If one divided by 10 is zero, but I'm
seeing 0.00, where is it getting",00:08:16.340,00:08:22.850
converted back to a real number?,00:08:22.850,00:08:24.250
Yeah.,00:08:24.250,00:08:25.500
Exactly.,00:08:29.850,00:08:30.630
"&gt;&gt; So up here in line five, when I actually
store that 0.1, which is then",00:08:30.630,00:08:35.600
"truncated to zero, inside of a float,
that's effectively equivalent to",00:08:35.600,00:08:39.549
"storing it not as an int but,
indeed, as a float.",00:08:39.549,00:08:42.100
"Moreover, I'm then using printf to
explicitly print that number to two",00:08:42.100,00:08:46.540
"decimal places even though there
might not actually be any.",00:08:46.540,00:08:49.740
"&gt;&gt; So this kind of sucks, right?",00:08:49.740,00:08:51.020
"Apparently you can't do math,
at least at this level of",00:08:51.020,00:08:53.640
"precision, in a computer.",00:08:53.640,00:08:55.600
But surely there's a solution.,00:08:55.600,00:08:56.930
"What's the simplest fix we could maybe
do, even just intuitively here to",00:08:56.930,00:09:00.410
solve this?,00:09:00.410,00:09:01.130
Yeah?,00:09:01.130,00:09:02.380
Turn the integers into--,00:09:04.700,00:09:06.574
yeah.,00:09:06.574,00:09:06.976
"Even if I'm not quite sure what's
really going on here, if it",00:09:06.976,00:09:10.420
"fundamentally has to do with these both
being ints, well, why don't I",00:09:10.420,00:09:13.440
"make that 10.0, making this
1.0, resave the file.",00:09:13.440,00:09:18.230
"Let me go back down to the
bottom and recompile.",00:09:18.230,00:09:20.990
Let me now rerun.,00:09:20.990,00:09:23.030
And there--,00:09:23.030,00:09:23.420
"now, I've got my one tenth
represented as 0.10.",00:09:23.420,00:09:27.690
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:09:27.690,00:09:28.420
So that's not bad.,00:09:28.420,00:09:29.220
"And let me point out one other way
we could have solved this.",00:09:29.220,00:09:31.730
"Let me actually roll back in time
to when we had this as one",00:09:31.730,00:09:35.580
tenth a moment ago.,00:09:35.580,00:09:36.680
"And let me go ahead and resave this file
as a different file name, just to",00:09:36.680,00:09:40.800
have a little checkpoint.,00:09:40.800,00:09:41.750
So that was version one.,00:09:41.750,00:09:43.450
"And now let me go ahead and
do one more version.",00:09:43.450,00:09:45.520
"We'll call this version
two zero indexed.",00:09:45.520,00:09:48.540
"&gt;&gt; And I'm going to instead do
this-- you know what?",00:09:48.540,00:09:51.280
Adding dot zero works in this case.,00:09:51.280,00:09:54.400
But suppose one were a variable.,00:09:54.400,00:09:56.060
Supposed 10 were a variable.,00:09:56.060,00:09:57.680
"In other words, suppose that I couldn't
just hard-code .0 at the end",00:09:57.680,00:10:00.680
of this arithmetic expression.,00:10:00.680,00:10:02.340
"Well, I can actually do something
in parentheses called casting.",00:10:02.340,00:10:05.820
"I can cast that integer 10 to a float,
and I can cast that integer one to a",00:10:05.820,00:10:11.920
"float, as well.",00:10:11.920,00:10:12.800
"Then the math that's going to be done
is effectively 1.0 divided by 10.0,",00:10:12.800,00:10:17.190
"the result of which goes
in f as before.",00:10:17.190,00:10:19.250
"So if I recompile this as make floats
2, and now floats 2, I get the same",00:10:19.250,00:10:26.130
"answer, as well.",00:10:26.130,00:10:27.020
"&gt;&gt; So this is a fairly contrived example,
to solve this problem",00:10:27.020,00:10:29.640
by introducing casting.,00:10:29.640,00:10:31.400
"But in general, casting's going to be
a powerful thing, particularly for",00:10:31.400,00:10:34.410
"problem set two in a week's time, when
you want to convert one data type to",00:10:34.410,00:10:38.180
"another that at the end of the day
are represented in the same way.",00:10:38.180,00:10:41.800
"At the end of the day, every single
thing we've talked about thus far is",00:10:41.800,00:10:44.970
just ints underneath the hood.,00:10:44.970,00:10:46.710
"Or if that's too low-level for
you, they're just numbers",00:10:46.710,00:10:48.950
underneath the hood.,00:10:48.950,00:10:49.750
"Even characters, again, recall
from week zero, are numbers",00:10:49.750,00:10:52.850
underneath the hood.,00:10:52.850,00:10:53.990
"&gt;&gt; Which is to say, we can convert between
different types of numbers if",00:10:53.990,00:10:57.240
they're just bits.,00:10:57.240,00:10:58.060
"We can convert between numbers
and letters if they're just",00:10:58.060,00:11:01.020
"bits, and vice versa.",00:11:01.020,00:11:02.580
"And casting in this way is a mechanism
in programming that lets you forcibly",00:11:02.580,00:11:07.170
change one data type to another.,00:11:07.170,00:11:10.970
"Unfortunately, this isn't as
straightforward as I might have liked.",00:11:10.970,00:11:14.570
"&gt;&gt; I'm going to go back into floats
1, which was the simpler, more",00:11:14.570,00:11:19.220
"straightforward one with
.0 added on to each.",00:11:19.220,00:11:22.830
"And just as a quick refresher,
let me go ahead and recompile",00:11:22.830,00:11:25.260
"this, make floats 2--",00:11:25.260,00:11:27.670
"sorry, this is make floats 1.",00:11:27.670,00:11:30.300
And now let's run floats 1.,00:11:30.300,00:11:32.050
"And in the bottom, notice
that I indeed get 0.1.",00:11:32.050,00:11:34.810
"So, problem solved.",00:11:34.810,00:11:36.165
&gt;&gt; But not yet.,00:11:36.165,00:11:37.280
"I'm now going to get a little curious,
and I'm going to go back into my",00:11:37.280,00:11:40.000
"printf statement and
say, you know what?",00:11:40.000,00:11:41.620
"I'd like to confirm that this
is really one tenth.",00:11:41.620,00:11:44.090
"And I'm going to want to see this
to, say, five decimal places.",00:11:44.090,00:11:47.890
It's not a problem.,00:11:47.890,00:11:48.570
"I change the two to a five,
I recompile with make.",00:11:48.570,00:11:52.020
I rerun it as floats 1.,00:11:52.020,00:11:53.770
Looking pretty good.,00:11:53.770,00:11:54.990
"My sanity checks might end there, but
I'm getting a little more adventurous.",00:11:54.990,00:11:58.570
I'm going to change 0.5 to 0.10.,00:11:58.570,00:12:00.330
"I want to see 10 digits after
the decimal place.",00:12:00.330,00:12:03.440
"&gt;&gt; And I'm going to go ahead and recompile
this and rerun floats 1.",00:12:03.440,00:12:09.060
"I kind of regret having tested this
further because my math is not so",00:12:09.060,00:12:13.060
"correct anymore, it seems.",00:12:13.060,00:12:14.320
"But wait a minute, maybe
that's just a fluke.",00:12:14.320,00:12:15.630
"Maybe the computer is acting
a little bit strange.",00:12:15.630,00:12:17.810
"Let me go ahead and do 20 decimal points
and reassure myself that I know",00:12:17.810,00:12:21.810
how to do math.,00:12:21.810,00:12:22.540
I know how to program.,00:12:22.540,00:12:23.460
"Make floats 1, recompile, and damn it.",00:12:23.460,00:12:26.960
"That is really, really getting
far from the mark.",00:12:26.960,00:12:31.110
&gt;&gt; So what's going on here?,00:12:31.110,00:12:32.490
"Intuitively, based on our assumptions
earlier about the size of data types,",00:12:32.490,00:12:36.050
"what must be happening here
underneath the hood?",00:12:36.050,00:12:38.040
Yeah?,00:12:38.040,00:12:39.290
Exactly.,00:12:43.000,00:12:43.590
"If you want this much precision, and
that's a heck of a lot of precision--",00:12:43.590,00:12:46.480
20 numbers after the decimal point.,00:12:46.480,00:12:48.770
"You can't possibly represent an
arbitrary number unless you have an",00:12:48.770,00:12:51.990
arbitrary number of bits.,00:12:51.990,00:12:52.930
But we don't.,00:12:52.930,00:12:54.190
"For a float, we only have 32 bits.",00:12:54.190,00:12:57.200
"&gt;&gt; So if 32 bits can only be permuted in a
way-- just like our humans on, stage",00:12:57.200,00:13:02.260
"hands up or down-- in a finite number of
ways, there's only a finite number",00:13:02.260,00:13:05.780
"of real numbers you can represent
with those bits.",00:13:05.780,00:13:08.640
"And so the computer eventually
is going to have to",00:13:08.640,00:13:10.500
start cutting corners.,00:13:10.500,00:13:11.730
"The computer can hide those details
from us for a little bit of time.",00:13:11.730,00:13:15.500
"But if we start poking at the numbers
and looking farther and farther at the",00:13:15.500,00:13:18.880
"trailing numbers in the whole number,
then we start to see that it's",00:13:18.880,00:13:23.220
"actually approximating the
idea of one tenth.",00:13:23.220,00:13:26.480
"&gt;&gt; And so it turns out, tragically, there's
an infinite number of numbers",00:13:26.480,00:13:29.860
"we cannot represent precisely in a
computer, at least with a finite",00:13:29.860,00:13:35.060
"number of bits, a finite
amount of RAM.",00:13:35.060,00:13:38.030
"Now unfortunately, this sometimes
has real-world consequences.",00:13:38.030,00:13:41.210
"If people don't quite appreciate this
or sort of take for granted the fact",00:13:41.210,00:13:45.980
"that their computer will just do what
they tell it to do and don't",00:13:45.980,00:13:48.310
"understand these underlying
representation details--",00:13:48.310,00:13:51.430
"which, frankly, in some languages are
hidden from the user, unlike in C--",00:13:51.430,00:13:55.290
some bad things can happen.,00:13:55.290,00:13:56.500
"&gt;&gt; And what I thought we'd do
is take a step back.",00:13:56.500,00:13:58.650
"And this is about an
eight-minute video.",00:13:58.650,00:14:00.420
"It aired a few years ago, and it gives
insights into actually what can go",00:14:00.420,00:14:04.200
"wrong when you under-appreciate these
kinds of details in the very all-too",00:14:04.200,00:14:09.290

"If we could dim the lights
for a few minutes.",00:14:10.080,00:14:12.965
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: We now return to engineering,00:14:12.965,00:14:14.360
disasters on Modern Marvels.,00:14:14.360,00:14:17.160
&gt;&gt; Computers--,00:14:17.160,00:14:18.680
"we've all come to accept the
often frustrating problems",00:14:18.680,00:14:21.340
that go with them.,00:14:21.340,00:14:23.170
"Bugs, viruses, and software glitches
are small prices to pay for the",00:14:23.170,00:14:27.570
convenience.,00:14:27.570,00:14:28.960
"But in high-tech and high-speed
military and space program",00:14:28.960,00:14:32.040
"applications, the smallest problem
can be magnified into disaster.",00:14:32.040,00:14:38.650
"&gt;&gt; On June 4, 1996, scientists prepared to
launch an unmanned Ariane 5 rocket.",00:14:38.650,00:14:44.480
"It was carrying scientific satellites
designed to establish precisely how",00:14:44.480,00:14:48.700
"the Earth's magnetic field interacts
with solar winds.",00:14:48.700,00:14:53.250
"The rocket was built for the European
Space Agency and lifted off from its",00:14:53.250,00:14:57.540
"facility on the coast
of French Guiana.",00:14:57.540,00:14:59.906
"&gt;&gt; JACK GANSSLE: At about 37 seconds into
the flight, they first noticed",00:14:59.906,00:15:03.660
something was going wrong.,00:15:03.660,00:15:04.910
"The nozzles were swiveling in
a way they really shouldn't.",00:15:04.910,00:15:08.130
"Around 40 seconds into the flight,
clearly the vehicle was in trouble.",00:15:08.130,00:15:12.380
"And that's when they made a
decision to destroy it.",00:15:12.380,00:15:14.400
"The range safety officer, with
tremendous guts, pressed the button,",00:15:14.400,00:15:18.520
"blew up the rocket before it could
become a hazard to public safety.",00:15:18.520,00:15:23.900
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: This was the maiden voyage
of the Ariane 5, and its destruction",00:15:23.900,00:15:27.810
"took place because of a flaw embedded
in the rocket's software.",00:15:27.810,00:15:32.020
"&gt;&gt; JACK GANSSLE: The problem on the Ariane
was that there was a number",00:15:32.020,00:15:33.980
that required 64 bits to express.,00:15:33.980,00:15:36.390
"And they wanted to convert
to a 16-bit number.",00:15:36.390,00:15:39.420
"They assumed that the number was never
going to be very big, that most of",00:15:39.420,00:15:43.130
"those digits in the 64-bit
number were zeros.",00:15:43.130,00:15:46.810
They were wrong.,00:15:46.810,00:15:48.270
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: The inability of one software
program to accept the kind of",00:15:48.270,00:15:51.380
"number generated by another was
at the root of the failure.",00:15:51.380,00:15:55.350
"Software development had become a very
costly part of new technology.",00:15:55.350,00:15:59.970
"The Ariane 4 rocket had been very
successful, so much of the software",00:15:59.970,00:16:03.980
"created for it was also
used in the Ariane 5.",00:16:03.980,00:16:07.480
"&gt;&gt; PHILIP COYLE: The basic problem was
that the Ariane 5 was faster,",00:16:07.480,00:16:11.980
accelerated faster.,00:16:11.980,00:16:13.720
"And the software hadn't
accounted for that.",00:16:13.720,00:16:17.250
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: The destruction of the rocket
was a huge financial disaster,",00:16:17.250,00:16:20.770
all due to a minute software error.,00:16:20.770,00:16:24.200
"But this wasn't the first time data
conversion problems had plagued modern",00:16:24.200,00:16:27.820
rocket technology.,00:16:27.820,00:16:30.620
"&gt;&gt; JACK GANSSLE: In 1991, with the start
of the first Gulf War, the Patriot",00:16:30.620,00:16:34.480
"missile experienced a similar kind
of a number conversion problem.",00:16:34.480,00:16:38.610
"As a result, 28 American soldiers were
killed and about 100 others wounded",00:16:38.610,00:16:44.910
"when the Patriot, which was supposed
to protect against incoming Scuds,",00:16:44.910,00:16:48.600
failed to fire a missile.,00:16:48.600,00:16:51.630
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: When Iraq invaded Kuwait and
America launched Desert Storm in",00:16:51.630,00:16:55.110
"early 1991, Patriot missile batteries
were deployed to protect Saudi Arabia",00:16:55.110,00:17:00.570
"and Israel from Iraqi Scud
missile attacks.",00:17:00.570,00:17:04.760
"The Patriot is a US medium-range
surface-to-air system manufactured by",00:17:04.760,00:17:09.720
the Raytheon company.,00:17:09.720,00:17:11.569
"&gt;&gt; THEODORE POSTOL: The size of the Patriot
interceptor itself is roughly",00:17:11.569,00:17:16.410
20-feet long.,00:17:16.410,00:17:17.710
And it weighs about 2000 pounds.,00:17:17.710,00:17:20.800
And it carries a warhead of about--,00:17:20.800,00:17:22.940
I think it's roughly 150 pounds.,00:17:22.940,00:17:24.905
"And the warhead itself is a
high explosive which has",00:17:24.905,00:17:31.030
fragments around it.,00:17:31.030,00:17:33.270
"The casing of the warhead is designed
to act like buckshot.",00:17:33.270,00:17:37.490
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: The missiles are carried four
per container and are transported",00:17:37.490,00:17:40.720
by a semi trailer.,00:17:40.720,00:17:43.050
"&gt;&gt; PHILIP COYLE: The Patriot anti-missile
system goes back at",00:17:43.050,00:17:47.490
least 20 years now.,00:17:47.490,00:17:50.710
"It was originally designed as
an air defense missile to",00:17:50.710,00:17:54.350
shoot down enemy airplanes.,00:17:54.350,00:17:56.190
"In the first Gulf War, when that war
came along, the Army wanted to use it",00:17:56.190,00:18:02.490
"to shoot down Scuds, not airplanes.",00:18:02.490,00:18:05.535
"The Iraqi air force was not
so much of a problem.",00:18:05.535,00:18:09.310
But the Army was worried about Scuds.,00:18:09.310,00:18:12.450
"And so they tried to upgrade
the Patriot.",00:18:12.450,00:18:15.950
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Intercepting an enemy missile
traveling at mach five was",00:18:15.950,00:18:18.750
going to be challenging enough.,00:18:18.750,00:18:20.890
"But when the Patriot was rushed into
service, the Army was not aware of an",00:18:20.890,00:18:25.590
"Iraqi modification that made their
Scuds nearly impossible to hit.",00:18:25.590,00:18:31.710
"&gt;&gt; THEODORE POSTOL: What happened
is the Scuds that were",00:18:31.710,00:18:35.240
coming in were unstable.,00:18:35.240,00:18:36.570
They were wobbling.,00:18:36.570,00:18:37.532
"The reason for this was the Iraqis, in
order to get 600 kilometers out of a",00:18:37.532,00:18:43.220
"300-kilometer-range missile, took
weight out of the front warhead.",00:18:43.220,00:18:47.530
They made the warhead lighter.,00:18:47.530,00:18:49.290
"So now the Patriot's trying
to come at the Scud.",00:18:49.290,00:18:53.110
"And most of the time, the overwhelming
majority of the time, it would just",00:18:53.110,00:18:56.470
fly by the Scud.,00:18:56.470,00:18:58.730
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Once the Patriot system
operators realized the Patriot missed",00:18:58.730,00:19:01.760
"its target, they detonated the Patriots
warhead to avoid possible",00:19:01.760,00:19:06.690
"casualties if it was allowed
to fall to the ground.",00:19:06.690,00:19:10.300
"&gt;&gt; THEODORE POSTOL: That was what most
people saw as big fireballs in the sky",00:19:10.300,00:19:14.540
"and misunderstood as intercepts
of Scud warheads.",00:19:14.540,00:19:20.350
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Although in the night skies
Patriots appeared to be successfully",00:19:20.350,00:19:23.320
"destroying Scuds, at Dhahran there
could be no mistake about its",00:19:23.320,00:19:27.530
performance.,00:19:27.530,00:19:29.140
"There, the Patriot's radar system lost
track of an incoming Scud and never",00:19:29.140,00:19:34.180
launched due to a software flaw.,00:19:34.180,00:19:36.380
"&gt;&gt; It was the Israelis who first discovered
that the longer the system",00:19:39.890,00:19:42.700
"was on, the greater the time discrepancy
became due to a clock",00:19:42.700,00:19:48.020
embedded in the system's computer.,00:19:48.020,00:19:50.470
"&gt;&gt; JACK GANSSLE: About two weeks before the
tragedy in Dhahran, the Israelis",00:19:50.470,00:19:54.640
"reported to the Defense Department
that the system was losing time.",00:19:54.640,00:19:58.440
"After about eight hours of running,
they noticed that the system is",00:19:58.440,00:20:01.280
becoming noticeably less accurate.,00:20:01.280,00:20:03.530
"The Defense Department responded by
telling all of the Patriot batteries",00:20:03.530,00:20:07.710
"to not leave the systems
on for a long time.",00:20:07.710,00:20:10.500
They never said what a long time was.,00:20:10.500,00:20:12.430
Eight hours?,00:20:12.430,00:20:13.330
10 hours?,00:20:13.330,00:20:13.810
"1,000 hours?",00:20:13.810,00:20:14.990
Nobody knew.,00:20:14.990,00:20:17.150
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: The Patriot battery stationed
at the barracks at Dhahran",00:20:17.150,00:20:20.220
"and its flawed internal clock had been
on over 100 hours on the night of",00:20:20.220,00:20:24.660
February 25th.,00:20:24.660,00:20:27.470
"&gt;&gt; JACK GANSSLE: It tracked time to an
accuracy of about a tenth of a second.",00:20:27.470,00:20:31.770
"Now, a tenth of a second is an
interesting number because it can't be",00:20:31.770,00:20:34.480
"expressed in binary exactly, which means
it can't be expressed exactly in",00:20:34.480,00:20:39.940
any modern digital computer.,00:20:39.940,00:20:42.500
"It's hard to believe, but
use this as an example.",00:20:42.500,00:20:46.920
Let's take the number one third.,00:20:46.920,00:20:49.000
"One third cannot be expressed
in decimal exactly.",00:20:49.000,00:20:53.150
"One third is 0.333 going
on for infinity.",00:20:53.150,00:20:57.500
"There's no way to do that with
absolute accuracy in decimal.",00:20:57.500,00:21:02.270
"That's exactly the same kind of problem
that happened in the Patriot.",00:21:02.270,00:21:05.370
"The longer the system ran, the
worst the time error became.",00:21:05.370,00:21:09.880
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: After 100 hours of operation,
the error in time was only",00:21:09.880,00:21:13.840
about one third of a second.,00:21:13.840,00:21:16.140
"But in terms of targeting a missile
traveling at mach five, it resulted in",00:21:16.140,00:21:20.800
a tracking error of over 600 meters.,00:21:20.800,00:21:24.410
"It would be a fatal error for
the soldiers at Dhahran.",00:21:24.410,00:21:27.670
"&gt;&gt; THEODORE POSTOL: What happened is a
Scud launch was detected by early",00:21:27.670,00:21:33.450
warning satellites.,00:21:33.450,00:21:34.280
"And they knew that the Scud was coming
in their general direction.",00:21:34.280,00:21:38.550
They didn't know where it was coming.,00:21:38.550,00:21:41.000
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: It was now up to the radar
component of the Patriot system",00:21:41.000,00:21:43.900
"defending Dhahran to locate and keep
track of the incoming enemy missile.",00:21:43.900,00:21:48.910
"&gt;&gt; JACK GANSSLE: The radar
was very smart.",00:21:48.910,00:21:50.580
"It would actually track the position of
the Scud and then predict where it",00:21:50.580,00:21:53.770
"probably would be the next time
the radar sent a pulse out.",00:21:53.770,00:21:57.160
That was called the range gate.,00:21:57.160,00:21:58.870
"&gt;&gt; THEODORE POSTOL: Then once the Patriot
decides enough time has passed to go",00:21:58.870,00:22:04.020
"back and check the next location for
this detected object, it goes back.",00:22:04.020,00:22:09.420
"So when it went back to the wrong
place, it then sees no object.",00:22:09.420,00:22:14.450
"And it decides that there was no object,
it was a false detection, and",00:22:14.450,00:22:18.200
drops the track.,00:22:18.200,00:22:19.680
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: The incoming Scud disappeared
from the radar screen, and",00:22:19.680,00:22:22.970
"seconds later it slammed
into the barracks.",00:22:22.970,00:22:26.050
"The Scud killed 28 and was the last one
fired during the first Gulf War.",00:22:26.050,00:22:31.950
"Tragically, the updated software arrived
at Dhahran the following day.",00:22:31.950,00:22:37.700
"The software flaw had been fixed,
closing one chapter in the troubled",00:22:37.700,00:22:41.800
history of the Patriot missile.,00:22:41.800,00:22:43.690
"&gt;&gt; Patriot is actually an acronym
for Phased Array TRacking",00:22:46.780,00:22:50.710
Intercept Of Target.,00:22:50.710,00:22:51.960
"&gt;&gt; DAVID J MALAN: All right, so a
sobering example, to be sure.",00:22:54.650,00:23:00.840
"And fortunately, these lower level
bugs are not something that we'll",00:23:00.840,00:23:03.430
"typically have to appreciate, certainly
not with some of our",00:23:03.430,00:23:06.220
earliest of programs.,00:23:06.220,00:23:07.360
"Rather, most of the bugs you'll
encounter will be logical in nature,",00:23:07.360,00:23:10.450
"syntactic in nature whereby the
code just doesn't work right.",00:23:10.450,00:23:12.900
And you know it pretty fast.,00:23:12.900,00:23:14.140
"&gt;&gt; But particularly when we get to the
end of the semester, it's going to",00:23:14.140,00:23:16.850
"become more and more of a possibility to
really think hard about the design",00:23:16.850,00:23:20.620
"of your programs and the underlying
representation",00:23:20.620,00:23:22.960
"there, too, of the data.",00:23:22.960,00:23:24.520
"For instance, we'll introduce MySQL,
which is a popular database engine",00:23:24.520,00:23:28.010
"that you can use with websites to
store data on the back end.",00:23:28.010,00:23:30.850
"And you'll have to start to decide at
the end of the semester not only what",00:23:30.850,00:23:34.630
"types of data along these lines to use
but exactly how many bits to use,",00:23:34.630,00:23:38.790
"whether or not you want to store dates
as dates and times as times, and also",00:23:38.790,00:23:42.740
"things like how big do you want the
unique IDs to be for, say, the users",00:23:42.740,00:23:46.890
in your database.,00:23:46.890,00:23:47.680
"&gt;&gt; In fact, if some of you have had
Facebook accounts for quite some time,",00:23:47.680,00:23:51.210
"and you know how to get access
to your User ID--",00:23:51.210,00:23:53.680
"which sometimes shows up in your
profile's URL unless you've chosen a",00:23:53.680,00:23:57.930
"nickname for the URL, or if you've
used Facebook's Graph API, the",00:23:57.930,00:24:02.070
"publicly available API by which you
can ask Facebook for raw data--",00:24:02.070,00:24:05.510
you can see what your numeric ID is.,00:24:05.510,00:24:07.580
"And some years ago, Facebook essentially
had to change from using",00:24:07.580,00:24:10.880
"the equivalent of ints to using long
long because over time as users come",00:24:10.880,00:24:15.980
"and go and create lots of accounts and
fake accounts, even they very easily",00:24:15.980,00:24:19.780
"were able to exhaust something like a 4
billion possible value like an int.",00:24:19.780,00:24:24.630
"&gt;&gt; So more on those kinds of issues
down the road, as well.",00:24:24.630,00:24:28.340
"All right, so that was casting.",00:24:28.340,00:24:30.750
That was imprecision.,00:24:30.750,00:24:31.670
A couple of quick announcements.,00:24:31.670,00:24:32.730
"So sections formally begin this coming
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.",00:24:32.730,00:24:35.710
"You'll hear via email later this week
as to your section assignment.",00:24:35.710,00:24:39.080
"And you'll also here at that point how
to change your section if your",00:24:39.080,00:24:42.570
"schedule has now changed or your
comfort level has now changed.",00:24:42.570,00:24:45.660
"Meanwhile P-set one and hacker one are
due this Thursday with the option to",00:24:45.660,00:24:49.380
"extend that deadline per the
specifications to Friday",00:24:49.380,00:24:52.450
in a typical way.,00:24:52.450,00:24:53.830
"&gt;&gt; Realize that included with the problem
set specifications are instructions on",00:24:53.830,00:24:57.500
"how to use the CS50 appliance, make,
as well as some CS50 specific tools",00:24:57.500,00:25:02.770
"like style 50, which can provide you
with feedback dynamically on the",00:25:02.770,00:25:06.540
"quality of your code style and also
check 50, which can provide you with",00:25:06.540,00:25:10.230
"dynamic feedback as to your
code's correctness.",00:25:10.230,00:25:13.160
"Forgive that we're still ironing
out a few kinks with check 50.",00:25:13.160,00:25:16.850
"A few of your classmates who did start
around four AM on Friday night when",00:25:16.850,00:25:21.490
"the spec went up have noticed since then
a few bugs that we are working",00:25:21.490,00:25:25.130
"through, and apologies for anyone who
has experienced undue frustrations.",00:25:25.130,00:25:29.010
The fault is mine.,00:25:29.010,00:25:30.340
"But we'll follow up on the CS50
discuss when that is resolved.",00:25:30.340,00:25:34.080
&gt;&gt; So a word on scores themselves.,00:25:34.080,00:25:35.700
"So it'll be a week or two before you
start to get feedback on problem sets",00:25:35.700,00:25:38.990
"because you don't yet have
a teaching fellow.",00:25:38.990,00:25:40.640
"And even then, we will start to evaluate
the C problem sets before we",00:25:40.640,00:25:44.510
"go back and evaluate scratch so
that you get more relevant",00:25:44.510,00:25:46.970
feedback more quickly.,00:25:46.970,00:25:48.150
"But in general per the syllabus, CS50
problem sets are evaluated along the",00:25:48.150,00:25:51.870
following four axes--,00:25:51.870,00:25:53.580
"scope, correctness, design, and style.",00:25:53.580,00:25:55.760
"&gt;&gt; Scope is going to be a number typically
between zero and five that",00:25:55.760,00:25:59.210
"captures how much of the
piece that you bit off.",00:25:59.210,00:26:01.830
"Typically, you want this to be five.",00:26:01.830,00:26:03.750
You at least tried everything.,00:26:03.750,00:26:05.300
"And notice it's a multiplicative factor
so that doing only part of the",00:26:05.300,00:26:09.330
problem set is not the best strategy.,00:26:09.330,00:26:12.520
"&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, more obvious is the
importance of correctness--",00:26:12.520,00:26:15.610
"just is your program correct with
respect to the specification?",00:26:15.610,00:26:18.620
"This is weighted deliberately more
heavily than the other two axes by a",00:26:18.620,00:26:21.510
"factor of three because we recognize
that typically you're going to spend a",00:26:21.510,00:26:24.450
"lot more time chasing down some bugs,
getting your code to work, then you",00:26:24.450,00:26:28.600
"are indenting it and choosing
appropriate variable names and the",00:26:28.600,00:26:31.540
"like, which is on the other end
of the spectrum of style.",00:26:31.540,00:26:33.800
"&gt;&gt; That's not to say style is not
important, and we'll preach it over",00:26:33.800,00:26:36.160
time both in lectures and in sections.,00:26:36.160,00:26:37.920
"Style refers to the aesthetics
of your code.",00:26:37.920,00:26:40.520
"Have you chosen well-named variables
that are short but somewhat",00:26:40.520,00:26:43.980
descriptive?,00:26:43.980,00:26:44.680
"Is your code indented as you've seen in
lecture and in a manner consistent",00:26:44.680,00:26:47.840
with style 50?,00:26:47.840,00:26:49.070
"&gt;&gt; Lastly is design right
there in the middle.",00:26:49.070,00:26:51.220
"Design is the harder one to put a
finger on because it's much more",00:26:51.220,00:26:54.090
subjective.,00:26:54.090,00:26:55.000
"But it's perhaps the most important of
the three axes in terms of pedagogical",00:26:55.000,00:26:58.610
"value over time and that this will be
the teaching fellow's opportunity to",00:26:58.610,00:27:02.050
provide you with qualitative feedback.,00:27:02.050,00:27:04.110
"Indeed, in CS50 even though we do have
these formulas and scores, at the end",00:27:04.110,00:27:08.100
"of the day these are very deliberately
very small buckets-- point values",00:27:08.100,00:27:11.350
"between zero and three
and zero and five.",00:27:11.350,00:27:13.460
"We don't try to draw very coarse lines
between problem sets or between",00:27:13.460,00:27:17.800
"students but rather focus as much as
we can on qualitative, longhand",00:27:17.800,00:27:21.490
"feedback, either typed or verbal from
your particular teaching fellow,",00:27:21.490,00:27:25.490
you'll get to know quite well.,00:27:25.490,00:27:27.050
"&gt;&gt; But in general, those are the weights
that the various axes will have.",00:27:27.050,00:27:32.340
"Meanwhile, too, it's worth keeping in
mind that you should not assume that a",00:27:32.340,00:27:35.480
"three out of five is a 60% and
therefore roughly failing.",00:27:35.480,00:27:38.870
"Three is deliberately meant to be
sort of middle of the road good.",00:27:38.870,00:27:41.410
"If you're getting threes at the
beginning of the semester, that's",00:27:41.410,00:27:43.480
"indeed meant to be a good
place to begin.",00:27:43.480,00:27:46.340
"If you're getting twos, fairs, there's
definitely some work to pay a little",00:27:46.340,00:27:50.510
"more attention, to take advantage
of sections and office hours.",00:27:50.510,00:27:53.250
"&gt;&gt; If you're getting fours
and fives, great.",00:27:53.250,00:27:54.590
"But really, we hope to see trajectories
among students-- very",00:27:54.590,00:27:57.430
"individualized per student, but starting
the semester here in sort of",00:27:57.430,00:28:00.575
"the two to the three range but ending
up here in the four to five range.",00:28:00.575,00:28:04.100
That's what we're really looking for.,00:28:04.100,00:28:05.440
"And we do keep in mind the delta that
you exhibit between week zero and week",00:28:05.440,00:28:09.590
12 when I'm doing grades.,00:28:09.590,00:28:12.170
"It doesn't matter to us absolutely how
you fair at the beginning if your",00:28:12.170,00:28:16.380
"trajectory is indeed
upward and strong.",00:28:16.380,00:28:19.330
"&gt;&gt; Academic honesty-- so let me put on my
more serious voice for just a moment.",00:28:19.330,00:28:24.000
"So this course has the distinction of
sending more students than any other",00:28:24.000,00:28:28.510
"in history to the ad board, I believe.",00:28:28.510,00:28:30.950
"We have sort of lost count at this
point of how often this happens.",00:28:30.950,00:28:34.220
"And that's not because students in 50
are any more dishonest than their",00:28:34.220,00:28:37.090
classmates elsewhere.,00:28:37.090,00:28:38.690
"But realize, too, that we are very good
at detecting this sort of thing.",00:28:38.690,00:28:42.800
"&gt;&gt; And that is the advantage that a
computer science class has in that we",00:28:42.800,00:28:45.920
"can and we do compare all students
problem sets pair-wise against every",00:28:45.920,00:28:49.110
"other, not only this year
but all prior years.",00:28:49.110,00:28:51.470
"We have the ability, like students in
the class, to Google and to find code",00:28:51.470,00:28:55.080
"on sites like github and
discussion forums.",00:28:55.080,00:28:57.440
"There are absolutely solutions to CS50's
p-sets floating around there.",00:28:57.440,00:29:00.840
"But if you can find them,
we can find them.",00:29:00.840,00:29:02.710
"And all of this is very much automated
and easy and sad for us to find.",00:29:02.710,00:29:07.130
"&gt;&gt; But I want to emphasize, too, that the
course's academic honesty policy is",00:29:07.130,00:29:10.990
"very much meant to be very much
the opposite of that spirit.",00:29:10.990,00:29:13.960
"Indeed, this year we've rephrased things
in the syllabus to be this, dot",00:29:13.960,00:29:17.506
"dot dot, with more detail
in the syllabus.",00:29:17.506,00:29:19.790
"But the overarching theme in the course
really is to be reasonable.",00:29:19.790,00:29:22.860
"We recognize that there is a significant

"just look at mine and figure
it out from that.",00:30:20.730,00:30:22.510

"Or are you sure you want
that semicolon here?",00:30:32.760,00:30:34.800
"Or oh, that error message means this.",00:30:34.800,00:30:37.090
"Those are very reasonable and

campus because of that poor judgment.,00:31:13.070,00:31:15.150
But it's very easy to skirt that line.,00:31:15.150,00:31:17.840
"&gt;&gt; And here is a little picture to cheer
you up from Reddit so that now",00:31:17.840,00:31:22.950
everything will be OK.,00:31:22.950,00:31:25.720
"&gt;&gt; So a quick recap, then,
of where we left off.",00:31:25.720,00:31:30.210
"So last week, recall that we introduce
conditions, not in Scratch",00:31:30.210,00:31:33.690
but in C this time.,00:31:33.690,00:31:34.880
"And there was some new syntax but
really no new ideas per se.",00:31:34.880,00:31:38.300
"We had Boolean expressions that we could
or together with two vertical",00:31:38.300,00:31:42.630
"bars or and together with two
ampersands, saying that both the left",00:31:42.630,00:31:46.490
"and the right must be true
for this to execute.",00:31:46.490,00:31:49.990
"Then we had switches, which we looked
at briefly, but I propose are really",00:31:49.990,00:31:53.150
"just different syntax for achieving the
same kind of goal if you know in",00:31:53.150,00:31:56.830
"advance what your cases
are going to be.",00:31:56.830,00:31:59.270
&gt;&gt; We looked at loops.,00:31:59.270,00:32:00.160
"A for loop is maybe the most common,
or at least the one that people",00:32:00.160,00:32:03.340
typically reach for instinctively.,00:32:03.340,00:32:05.330
"Even though it looks a little cryptic,
you'll see many, many examples of this",00:32:05.330,00:32:08.240
"before long, as you have
already late last week.",00:32:08.240,00:32:11.590
"While loops can similarly
achieve the same thing.",00:32:11.590,00:32:14.280
"But if you want to do any incrementation
or updating of",00:32:14.280,00:32:17.550
"variable's values, you have to
do it more manually than the",00:32:17.550,00:32:20.230
for loop before allows.,00:32:20.230,00:32:22.440
"And then there's the do-while loop,
which allows us to do something at",00:32:22.440,00:32:25.310
"least once while something
else is true.",00:32:25.310,00:32:28.460
"And this is particularly good for
programs or for games where you want",00:32:28.460,00:32:31.550
"to prompt the user for something
at least once.",00:32:31.550,00:32:33.810
"And then if he or she doesn't cooperate,
you might want to do it",00:32:33.810,00:32:37.110
again and again.,00:32:37.110,00:32:38.420
"&gt;&gt; With variables, meanwhile, we had lines
of code like this, which could",00:32:38.420,00:32:41.270
be two lines.,00:32:41.270,00:32:41.950
"You could declare an int called
counter, semicolon.",00:32:41.950,00:32:44.830
"Or you can just declare and
define it, so to speak.",00:32:44.830,00:32:47.660
Give it a value at the same time.,00:32:47.660,00:32:49.950
"&gt;&gt; And then lastly, we talked
about functions.",00:32:49.950,00:32:51.890
"And this was a nice example in
the sense that it illustrates",00:32:51.890,00:32:54.270
two types of functions.,00:32:54.270,00:32:55.840
"One is GetString(), which, again,
gets a string from the user.",00:32:55.840,00:32:59.030
"But GetString() is kind of interesting,
so far as we've used it,",00:32:59.030,00:33:02.040
"because we've always used it with
something on the left-hand side of an",00:33:02.040,00:33:05.620
equal sign.,00:33:05.620,00:33:06.600
"That is to say that GetString()
returns a value.",00:33:06.600,00:33:09.830
"It returns, of course, a string.",00:33:09.830,00:33:11.970
"And then on the left-hand side, we're
simply saving that string inside of a",00:33:11.970,00:33:15.130
variable called name.,00:33:15.130,00:33:16.580
"&gt;&gt; This is different, in a sense, from
printf because printf, at least in our",00:33:16.580,00:33:21.100
"usage here, does not return anything.",00:33:21.100,00:33:23.540
"As an aside, it does return something.",00:33:23.540,00:33:24.960
We just don't care what it is.,00:33:24.960,00:33:26.380
"But it does have what's
called a side effect.",00:33:26.380,00:33:29.090
"And what is that side effect in every
case we've seen thus far?",00:33:29.090,00:33:31.840
What does printf do?,00:33:31.840,00:33:34.720
"It prints something to the screen,
displays text or numbers or something",00:33:34.720,00:33:37.780
on the screen.,00:33:37.780,00:33:38.380
"And that's just considered a side effect
because it's not really handing",00:33:38.380,00:33:41.170
it back to me.,00:33:41.170,00:33:41.900
"It's not an answer inside of
a black box that I can then",00:33:41.900,00:33:44.770
reach into and grab.,00:33:44.770,00:33:46.130
"It's just doing it on its own, much
like Colton was plugged into this",00:33:46.130,00:33:49.160
"black box last week, and he somehow
magically was drawing on the board",00:33:49.160,00:33:52.560
without me actually involved.,00:33:52.560,00:33:54.500
That would be a side effect.,00:33:54.500,00:33:55.560
"But if I actually had to reach back in
here and say, oh, here is the string",00:33:55.560,00:33:59.100
"from the user, that would
be a return value.",00:33:59.100,00:34:02.040
"&gt;&gt; And thus far we've only used functions
that other people have written.",00:34:02.040,00:34:05.650
"But we can actually do these
kinds of things ourselves.",00:34:05.650,00:34:09.219
"So I'm going to go into the
CS50 appliance again.",00:34:09.219,00:34:12.730
"Let me close the tab that we
had open a moment ago.",00:34:12.730,00:34:16.020
"And let me go ahead and
create a new file.",00:34:16.020,00:34:18.530
"And I'm going to go ahead and
call this one positive.c.",00:34:18.530,00:34:22.400
"So I want to do something with
positive numbers here.",00:34:22.400,00:34:24.770
So I'm going to go ahead and do int--,00:34:24.770,00:34:27.219
sorry--,00:34:27.219,00:34:28.000
#include .,00:34:28.000,00:34:31.840
"Let's not make that same
mistake as before.",00:34:31.840,00:34:34.280
"Int main (void), open curly
brace, closed curly brace.",00:34:34.280,00:34:40.020
&gt;&gt; And now I want to do the following.,00:34:40.020,00:34:41.639
"I want to write a program that
insists that the user gives",00:34:41.639,00:34:44.600
me a positive integer.,00:34:44.600,00:34:46.770
"So there is no GetPositiveInt function
in the CS50 library.",00:34:46.770,00:34:50.969
There's only GetInt().,00:34:50.969,00:34:52.610
"But that's OK because I have the
constructs with which I can impose a",00:34:52.610,00:34:55.790
little more constraint on that value.,00:34:55.790,00:34:59.360
I could do something like this.,00:34:59.360,00:35:00.990
&gt;&gt; So int n--,00:35:00.990,00:35:02.780
"and if you're typing along, just realize
I'm going to go back and",00:35:02.780,00:35:04.920
change some things in a moment--,00:35:04.920,00:35:06.430
so int n equals GetInt().,00:35:06.430,00:35:09.960
"And that's going to put
an int inside of n.",00:35:09.960,00:35:11.780
And let me be a more descriptive.,00:35:11.780,00:35:13.830
"Let me say something like I demand that
you give me a positive integer.",00:35:13.830,00:35:23.270
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:35:23.270,00:35:23.550
So just a little bit of instructions.,00:35:23.550,00:35:25.250
And now what can I do?,00:35:25.250,00:35:26.270
"Well, I already know from my simple
conditions or branches, just like I",00:35:26.270,00:35:29.840
"had in Scratch, I could say something
like if n is less than or equal to",00:35:29.840,00:35:36.100
"zero, then I want to do something
like, that is not positive.",00:35:36.100,00:35:44.460
And then I could do--,00:35:44.460,00:35:45.560
"OK, but I really want to get that int.",00:35:45.560,00:35:47.310
"So I could go up here and I could kind
of copy this and indent this.",00:35:47.310,00:35:52.020
"And then, OK.",00:35:52.020,00:35:52.570
"So if n is less than or
equal to zero do this.",00:35:52.570,00:35:56.990
"&gt;&gt; Now, what if the user
doesn't cooperate?",00:35:56.990,00:35:58.900
"Well, then I'm going to
borrow this here.",00:35:58.900,00:36:01.560
"And then I go in here
and here and here.",00:36:01.560,00:36:03.130
"So this is clearly not
the solution, right?",00:36:03.130,00:36:06.420
Because there's no end in sight.,00:36:06.420,00:36:07.810
"If I want to demand that the user gives
me a positive integer, I can",00:36:07.810,00:36:13.100
actually get the int.,00:36:13.100,00:36:14.150
I can then check for that int.,00:36:14.150,00:36:15.620
"But then I want to check it again and
check it again and check it again.",00:36:15.620,00:36:18.570
"So obviously, what's the better
construct to be using here?",00:36:18.570,00:36:21.680
"All right, so some kind of loop.",00:36:21.680,00:36:22.840
"&gt;&gt; So I'm going to get rid
of almost all of this.",00:36:22.840,00:36:25.430
"And I want to get this
int at least once.",00:36:25.430,00:36:27.320
So I'm going to say do--,00:36:27.320,00:36:28.890
"and I'll come back to the
while in just a moment--",00:36:28.890,00:36:32.110
"now, do what?",00:36:32.110,00:36:33.050
I'm going to do int n gets GetInt().,00:36:33.050,00:36:35.860
OK.,00:36:35.860,00:36:36.080
So that's pretty good.,00:36:36.080,00:36:37.250
"And now how often do
I want to do this?",00:36:37.250,00:36:39.750
"&gt;&gt; Let me put the printf inside of the loop
so I can demand again and again,",00:36:39.750,00:36:45.770
if need be.,00:36:45.770,00:36:46.740
"And what do I want this
while condition to do?",00:36:46.740,00:36:49.720
"I want to keep doing this
while what is the case?",00:36:49.720,00:36:53.870
Yeah.,00:36:53.870,00:36:54.125
N is less than or equal to zero.,00:36:54.125,00:36:55.390
"So already, we've significantly
cleaned this code up.",00:36:55.390,00:36:58.180
"We've borrowed a very simple construct--
the do-while loop.",00:36:58.180,00:37:00.700
"I've stolen just the important lines
of code that I started copying and",00:37:00.700,00:37:04.690
"pasting, which was not wise.",00:37:04.690,00:37:05.960
"And so now I'm going to actually paste
it in here and just do it once.",00:37:05.960,00:37:09.790
"&gt;&gt; And now what do I want to do at
the very end of this program?",00:37:09.790,00:37:12.990
"I'll just say something simple
like, thanks for the-- and",00:37:12.990,00:37:16.810
I'll do %i for int--,00:37:16.810,00:37:18.980
"backslash n, comma, and then
plug in n, semicolon.",00:37:18.980,00:37:23.270
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:37:23.270,00:37:23.910
"So let's see what happens now
when I run this program.",00:37:23.910,00:37:27.290
"I'm going to go ahead and
do make positive.",00:37:27.290,00:37:30.600
Damn.,00:37:30.600,00:37:30.880
A few errors.,00:37:30.880,00:37:31.600
So let me scroll back up to the first.,00:37:31.600,00:37:32.960
Don't work through them backwards.,00:37:32.960,00:37:34.020
"Work through them from top down
lest they cascade and only",00:37:34.020,00:37:37.000
one thing be wrong.,00:37:37.000,00:37:38.630
"Implicit declaration of
function GetInt().",00:37:38.630,00:37:42.532
Yeah.,00:37:42.532,00:37:43.020
So it wasn't enough.,00:37:43.020,00:37:44.420
"I kind of made the same mistake but
a little different this time.",00:37:44.420,00:37:46.760
"I need to not only include stdio.h but
also cs50.h, which includes the",00:37:46.760,00:37:51.940
"so-called declarations of get int, which
teach the appliance, or teaches",00:37:51.940,00:37:56.770
C what GetInt() is.,00:37:56.770,00:37:58.760
&gt;&gt; So let me resave.,00:37:58.760,00:37:59.550
"I'm going to ignore the other errors
because I'm going to hope that they're",00:37:59.550,00:38:02.040
"somehow related to the error
I already fixed.",00:38:02.040,00:38:05.210
"So let me go ahead and recompile
with make positive, Enter.",00:38:05.210,00:38:08.710
Damn.,00:38:08.710,00:38:09.020
"Three errors, still.",00:38:09.020,00:38:09.985
Let me scroll up to the first.,00:38:09.985,00:38:12.650
Unused variable n.,00:38:12.650,00:38:14.320
We've not seen this before.,00:38:14.320,00:38:15.850
"And this, too, is a little cryptic.",00:38:15.850,00:38:17.200
This is the output of the compiler.,00:38:17.200,00:38:18.850
"And what that highlighted line
there-- positive.c:9:13--",00:38:18.850,00:38:23.610
"is saying, it's saying on line nine of
positive.c, at the 13th character,",00:38:23.610,00:38:28.960
"13th column, you made this mistake.",00:38:28.960,00:38:31.510
"&gt;&gt; And in particular, it's telling
me unused variable n.",00:38:31.510,00:38:34.230
So let's see--,00:38:34.230,00:38:35.790
line nine.,00:38:35.790,00:38:37.150
"I'm using n in the sense that
I'm giving it a value.",00:38:37.150,00:38:40.430
"But what the compiler doesn't like is
that I'm not seemingly using it.",00:38:40.430,00:38:44.200
"But wait a minute, I am using it.",00:38:44.200,00:38:45.560
"In line 11, I'm using it here.",00:38:45.560,00:38:48.170
"But if I scroll down further
at positive.c:11--",00:38:48.170,00:38:52.430
"so at line 11, character 12, the
compiler's telling me, use of",00:38:52.430,00:38:56.230
undeclared identifier n.,00:38:56.230,00:38:58.670
"&gt;&gt; So undeclared means I have
not specified it as a",00:38:58.670,00:39:02.760
variable with a data type.,00:39:02.760,00:39:04.970
But wait a minute.,00:39:04.970,00:39:05.500
I did exactly that in line nine.,00:39:05.500,00:39:09.150
So someone is really confused here.,00:39:09.150,00:39:11.100
"It's either me or the compiler because
in line nine, again, I'm declaring an",00:39:11.100,00:39:14.900
"int n, and I'm assigning it the
return value of GetInt().",00:39:14.900,00:39:18.650
"Then I'm using that variable n in line
11 and checking if its value is less",00:39:18.650,00:39:22.930
than or equal to zero.,00:39:22.930,00:39:24.050
"But this apparently is
bad and broken why?",00:39:24.050,00:39:27.430
Say it again?,00:39:30.630,00:39:32.490
"&gt;&gt; Ah, I have to declare n before
entering the loop.",00:39:32.490,00:39:35.690
But why?,00:39:35.690,00:39:36.370
"I mean, we just proposed a bit ago that
it's fine to declare variables",00:39:36.370,00:39:39.830
"all on one line and then
assign them some value.",00:39:39.830,00:39:43.600
"A global variable-- let's come back
to that idea in just a moment.",00:39:43.600,00:39:46.790
"Why do you want me to put
it outside of the loop?",00:39:46.790,00:39:48.690
It is.,00:40:03.170,00:40:03.830
Exactly.,00:40:03.830,00:40:06.780
"&gt;&gt; So, albeit, somewhat counterintuitive,
let me summarize.",00:40:06.780,00:40:09.610
"When you declare n inside
of the do block there--",00:40:09.610,00:40:13.510
"specifically inside of
those curly braces--",00:40:13.510,00:40:16.320
"that variable n has what's
called a scope--",00:40:16.320,00:40:19.210
"unrelated to our scoring system in the
course-- but has a scope that's",00:40:19.210,00:40:23.210
limited to those curly braces.,00:40:23.210,00:40:25.190
"In other words, typically if you declare
a variable inside a set of",00:40:25.190,00:40:28.460
"curly braces, that variable only exists
inside of those curly braces.",00:40:28.460,00:40:33.370
"So by that logic alone, even though
I've declared n in line nine, it",00:40:33.370,00:40:37.320
"essentially disappears from scope,
disappears from memory, so to speak,",00:40:37.320,00:40:41.910
by the time I hit line 11.,00:40:41.910,00:40:43.370
"Because line 11, unfortunately, is
outside of those curly braces.",00:40:43.370,00:40:47.370
"&gt;&gt; So I unfortunately can't fix this by
going back to what I did it before.",00:40:47.370,00:40:51.540
You might at first do this.,00:40:51.540,00:40:53.370
"But what are you now not
doing cyclically?",00:40:53.370,00:40:56.370
"You're obviously not getting
the int cyclically.",00:40:56.370,00:40:58.260
"So we can leave the GetInt(), and we
should leave the GetInt() inside the",00:40:58.260,00:41:01.320
"loop because that's what we want to
pester the user for again and again.",00:41:01.320,00:41:04.420
"But it does suffice to go
up to line, say, six.",00:41:04.420,00:41:08.660
"Int n, semicolon.",00:41:08.660,00:41:10.150
"Don't give it a value yet because
you don't need to just yet.",00:41:10.150,00:41:12.990
"&gt;&gt; But now down here, notice-- this
would be a very easy mistake.",00:41:12.990,00:41:16.220
"I don't want to shadow my previous
declaration of n.",00:41:16.220,00:41:19.440
"I want to use the n that
actually exists.",00:41:19.440,00:41:22.830
"And so now in line 10,
I assign n a value.",00:41:22.830,00:41:25.780
"But in line six, I declare n.",00:41:25.780,00:41:28.580
"And so can I or can I not
use it in line 12 now?",00:41:28.580,00:41:32.940
"I can because between which curly
braces is n declared now?",00:41:32.940,00:41:37.120
The one up here on line five.,00:41:37.120,00:41:38.770
To one here on line 14.,00:41:38.770,00:41:40.330
"So if I now zoom out, save this file, go
back into and run make positive, it",00:41:40.330,00:41:49.770
compiled this time.,00:41:49.770,00:41:50.820
So that's already progress.,00:41:50.820,00:41:51.940
"Slash. ./positive, Enter.",00:41:51.940,00:41:53.640
"&gt;&gt; I demand that you give me
a positive integer.",00:41:53.640,00:41:56.060
Negative 1.,00:41:56.060,00:41:57.750
Negative 2.,00:41:57.750,00:41:59.020
Negative 3.,00:41:59.020,00:42:00.680
Zero.,00:42:00.680,00:42:01.760
One.,00:42:01.760,00:42:03.000
"And thanks for the one is
what's now printed.",00:42:03.000,00:42:05.130
"&gt;&gt; Let me try something else,
out of curiosity.",00:42:05.130,00:42:07.400
I'm being told to input an integer.,00:42:07.400,00:42:09.600
But what if I instead type in lamb?,00:42:09.600,00:42:12.870
So you now see a different prompt--,00:42:12.870,00:42:14.460
retry.,00:42:14.460,00:42:15.350
"But nowhere in my code
did I write retry.",00:42:15.350,00:42:17.670
"So where, presumably, is this retry
prompt coming from, would you say?",00:42:17.670,00:42:22.320
"Yeah, from GetInt() itself.",00:42:22.320,00:42:23.540
"So one of the things CS50's staff does
for you, at least in these first few",00:42:23.540,00:42:26.650
"weeks, is we have written some amount
of error checking to ensure that if",00:42:26.650,00:42:30.400
"you call GetInt(), you will at least
get back an int from the user.",00:42:30.400,00:42:34.260
You won't get a string.,00:42:34.260,00:42:35.460
You won't get a char.,00:42:35.460,00:42:36.440
"You won't get something
else altogether.",00:42:36.440,00:42:39.660
You'll get an int.,00:42:39.660,00:42:40.510
"&gt;&gt; Now, it might not be positive.",00:42:40.510,00:42:41.890
It might not be negative.,00:42:41.890,00:42:42.770
We make no guarantees around that.,00:42:42.770,00:42:44.550
"But we will pester the user to retry,
retry, retry until he or she actually",00:42:44.550,00:42:48.960
cooperates.,00:42:48.960,00:42:49.810
"Similarly, if I do 1.23,
that is not an int.",00:42:49.810,00:42:53.085
"But if I do type in, say, 50, that
gives me a value that I wanted.",00:42:53.085,00:42:58.400
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:42:58.400,00:42:59.050
So not bad.,00:42:59.050,00:43:01.380
Any questions on what we've just done?,00:43:01.380,00:43:04.780
"The key takeaway being, to be clear, not
so much the loop, which we've seen",00:43:04.780,00:43:07.930
"before even though we haven't really
used it, but the issue of scope, where",00:43:07.930,00:43:10.880
"variables can only be can only be used
within some specified scope.",00:43:10.880,00:43:17.045
"&gt;&gt; All right, let me address the suggestion
you made earlier, that of a",00:43:17.045,00:43:19.830
global variable.,00:43:19.830,00:43:20.860
"As an aside, it turns out that another
solution to this problem, but",00:43:20.860,00:43:24.880
"typically an incorrect solution or
a poorly designed solution, is to",00:43:24.880,00:43:28.880
"declare your variable as what's
called a global variable.",00:43:28.880,00:43:31.670
"Now I'm kind of violating my definition
of scope because there are",00:43:31.670,00:43:34.610
"no curly braces at the very top
and the very bottom of a file.",00:43:34.610,00:43:37.680
"But the implication of that
is that now in line four,",00:43:37.680,00:43:40.190
n is a global variable.,00:43:40.190,00:43:41.710
"And as the name implies, it's
just accessible everywhere.",00:43:41.710,00:43:44.460
&gt;&gt; Scratch actually has these.,00:43:44.460,00:43:45.790
"If you used a variable, you might recall
you had to choose if it's for",00:43:45.790,00:43:48.650
this sprite or for all sprites.,00:43:48.650,00:43:50.780
"Well, all sprites is just the clearer
way of saying global.",00:43:50.780,00:43:54.270
Yeah?,00:43:54.270,00:43:55.520
"Ah, really good question.",00:44:09.690,00:44:10.990
"&gt;&gt; So recall that in the very first version
of my code, when I incorrectly",00:44:10.990,00:44:14.310
declared and defined n in line nine--,00:44:14.310,00:44:17.700
"I declared it as a variable
and I gave it a value with",00:44:17.700,00:44:19.980
the assignment operator--,00:44:19.980,00:44:21.160
this gave me two errors.,00:44:21.160,00:44:22.520
"One, the fact that n wasn't used,
and two, that in line 11",00:44:22.520,00:44:26.560
it just wasn't declared.,00:44:26.560,00:44:27.770
"So the first one I didn't
address at the time.",00:44:27.770,00:44:31.120
"It is not strictly an error to declare
a variable but not use it.",00:44:31.120,00:44:35.130
"But one of the things we've done in
the CS50 appliance, deliberately,",00:44:35.130,00:44:38.540
"pedagogically, is we've cranked up the
expectations of the compiler to make",00:44:38.540,00:44:43.340
"sure that you're doing things not just
correctly but really correctly.",00:44:43.340,00:44:46.970
"&gt;&gt; Because if you're declaring a variable
like n and never using it, or using it",00:44:46.970,00:44:51.520
"correctly, then what
is it doing there?",00:44:51.520,00:44:53.700
It truly serves no purpose.,00:44:53.700,00:44:55.650
"And it's very easy over time, if you
don't configure your own computer in",00:44:55.650,00:44:58.980
"this way, to just have code that has
little remnants here, remnants there.",00:44:58.980,00:45:01.960
"And then months later you look back and
you're like, why is this line of",00:45:01.960,00:45:04.390
code there?,00:45:04.390,00:45:05.060
"And if there's no good reason, it
doesn't benefit you or your colleagues",00:45:05.060,00:45:07.940
"down the road to have to
stumble over it then.",00:45:07.940,00:45:10.650
"&gt;&gt; As an aside, where is
that coming from?",00:45:10.650,00:45:12.540
"Well, recall that every time we compile
program, all of this stuff is",00:45:12.540,00:45:16.410
being printed.,00:45:16.410,00:45:17.380
So we'll come back to this.,00:45:17.380,00:45:18.350
"But again, make is a utility that
automates the process of compiling by",00:45:18.350,00:45:22.230
"running the actual compiler
called clang.",00:45:22.230,00:45:24.830
"This thing, we'll eventually see, has
to do with debugging with a special",00:45:24.830,00:45:27.650
program called the debugger.,00:45:27.650,00:45:29.060
"This has to do with optimizing the
code-- more on that in future.",00:45:29.060,00:45:32.150
Std=c99--,00:45:32.150,00:45:33.620
"this just means use the 1999 version of
C. C's been around even longer than",00:45:33.620,00:45:37.870
"that, but they made some nice
changes 10 plus years ago.",00:45:37.870,00:45:40.830
&gt;&gt; And here's the relevant ones.,00:45:40.830,00:45:42.690
"We are saying make anything that
previously would have been a warning",00:45:42.690,00:45:45.880
"an error preventing the student
from compiling.",00:45:45.880,00:45:48.560
"And wall means do that for a
whole bunch of things, not",00:45:48.560,00:45:51.400
just related to variables.,00:45:51.400,00:45:53.060
"And then let me scroll to
the end of this line.",00:45:53.060,00:45:54.700
"And this, too, we'll eventually
come back to.",00:45:54.700,00:45:56.430
"This is obviously the name of
the file I'm compiling.",00:45:56.430,00:45:59.040
"This recalls the name of the file
I'm outputting as the name",00:45:59.040,00:46:02.160
of my runnable program.,00:46:02.160,00:46:04.070
"This -lcs50 just means use the CS50
library, and any zeros and ones that",00:46:04.070,00:46:08.970
"the staff wrote and compiled earlier
this year, integrate",00:46:08.970,00:46:12.390
them into my program.,00:46:12.390,00:46:13.490
&gt;&gt; And anyone know what -lm is?,00:46:13.490,00:46:16.130
"It's the math library, which is
just there even if you're",00:46:16.130,00:46:18.150
not doing any math.,00:46:18.150,00:46:19.320
"It's just automatically provided
to us by make.",00:46:19.320,00:46:22.620
"&gt;&gt; Well, let me do one other example
here by opening up a new file.",00:46:22.620,00:46:26.540
And let me save this one as string.c.,00:46:26.540,00:46:30.560
"It turns out that as we talk about data
types today, there's even more",00:46:30.560,00:46:37.980
"going on underneath the hood
than we've seen thus far.",00:46:37.980,00:46:40.630
So let me quickly do a quick program.,00:46:40.630,00:46:42.290
Include stdio.h.,00:46:42.290,00:46:44.510
And I'll save that.,00:46:44.510,00:46:45.730
"And you know, let me not make the
same mistake again and again.",00:46:45.730,00:46:48.110
Include cs50.h.,00:46:48.110,00:46:50.540
"And let me go ahead now
and do int main(void).",00:46:50.540,00:46:54.870
"&gt;&gt; And now I simply want to do a program
that does this-- declare a string",00:46:54.870,00:46:58.790
"called s and get a string
from the user.",00:46:58.790,00:47:03.610
"And let me do a little
instructions here--",00:47:03.610,00:47:05.820
"please give me a string-- so
the user knows what to do.",00:47:05.820,00:47:09.960
"And then down here below this,
I want to do the following--",00:47:09.960,00:47:13.190
for int i gets zero.,00:47:13.190,00:47:16.060
"Again, computer scientists typically
start counting at zero, but we could",00:47:16.060,00:47:18.580
make that one if we really wanted.,00:47:18.580,00:47:20.340
"Now I'm going to do i is less
than the string length of s.",00:47:20.340,00:47:27.240
So strlen--,00:47:27.240,00:47:28.430
S-T-R-L-E-N--,00:47:28.430,00:47:29.510
"again, it's concise because it's easier
to type, even though it's a",00:47:29.510,00:47:31.650
little cryptic.,00:47:31.650,00:47:32.590
"&gt;&gt; That is a function we've not used
before but literally does that--",00:47:32.590,00:47:35.290
"return to me a number that represents
the length of the string",00:47:35.290,00:47:37.810
that the user typed.,00:47:37.810,00:47:38.690
"If they typed in hello, it would return
five because there's five",00:47:38.690,00:47:41.740
letters in hello.,00:47:41.740,00:47:42.890
"Then, on each iteration of
this loop, i plus plus.",00:47:42.890,00:47:45.390
"So again, a standard construct even if
you're not quite too comfortable or",00:47:45.390,00:47:49.170
familiar with it yet.,00:47:49.170,00:47:50.420
"&gt;&gt; But now on each iteration of this loop,
notice what I'm going to do.",00:47:50.420,00:47:53.220
"I want to go ahead and print
out a single character--",00:47:53.220,00:47:56.690
so %c backslash n on a new line.,00:47:56.690,00:47:59.940
"And then, you know what I want to do?",00:47:59.940,00:48:00.990
"Whatever the word is that the user types
in, like hello, I want to print",00:48:00.990,00:48:05.090
"H-E-L-L-O, one character per line.",00:48:05.090,00:48:09.530
"In other words, I want to get at the
individual characters in a string,",00:48:09.530,00:48:13.080
"whereby up until now a string has just
been a sequence of characters.",00:48:13.080,00:48:16.770
"&gt;&gt; And it turns out I can do s, bracket,
i, close bracket, close",00:48:16.770,00:48:21.690
"parenthesis, semicolon.",00:48:21.690,00:48:23.580
And I do have to do one more thing.,00:48:23.580,00:48:25.640
"It's in a file called string.h
that strlen is declared.",00:48:25.640,00:48:30.570
"So if I want to use that function,
I need to tell the compiler,",00:48:30.570,00:48:33.190
expect to use it.,00:48:33.190,00:48:34.450
"Now let me go ahead and make
the program called string.",00:48:34.450,00:48:37.040
"Dot, slash, string.",00:48:37.040,00:48:39.150
&gt;&gt; Please give me a string.,00:48:39.150,00:48:40.130
I'll go ahead and type it.,00:48:40.130,00:48:40.900
"Hello, in all caps, Enter.",00:48:40.900,00:48:43.040
"And now notice I've printed this
one character after the other.",00:48:43.040,00:48:47.390
"So the new detail here is that a string,
at the end of the day, can be",00:48:47.390,00:48:51.450
"accessed by way of its individual
characters by introducing the square",00:48:51.450,00:48:54.810
bracket notation.,00:48:54.810,00:48:55.840
"And that's because a string underneath
the hood is indeed a sequence of",00:48:55.840,00:48:59.090
characters.,00:48:59.090,00:48:59.810
"But what's neat about them is
in your computer's RAM--",00:48:59.810,00:49:02.010
"Mac, PC, whatever it is-- they're
literally back to back to back--",00:49:02.010,00:49:05.300
H-E-L-L-O--,00:49:05.300,00:49:06.225
"at individual, adjacent
bytes in memory.",00:49:06.225,00:49:09.920
"&gt;&gt; So if you want to get at the eighth such
byte, which in this loop would be",00:49:09.920,00:49:13.210
"bracket zero, bracket one, bracket two,
bracket three, bracket four--",00:49:13.210,00:49:16.900
that's zero indexed up until five--,00:49:16.900,00:49:18.890
"that will print out H-E-L-L-O
on its own line.",00:49:18.890,00:49:23.330
"&gt;&gt; Now, as a teaser, let me show you the
sorts of things you'll eventually be",00:49:23.330,00:49:26.320
"able to understand, at least
with some close looking.",00:49:26.320,00:49:31.950
"For one, what we included in today's
examples, if you'd like, is actually",00:49:31.950,00:49:35.610
"one of the very first jailbreaks
for the iPhone.",00:49:35.610,00:49:38.300
"Jailbreaking means cracking the phone
so you can actually use it on a",00:49:38.300,00:49:40.800
"different carrier or install
your own software.",00:49:40.800,00:49:43.380
"And you'll notice this looks completely
cryptic, most likely.",00:49:43.380,00:49:45.660
But look at this.,00:49:45.660,00:49:46.520
"The iPhone was apparently cracked with
a for loop, an if condition, an else",00:49:46.520,00:49:50.420
"condition, a bunch of functions
we've not seen.",00:49:50.420,00:49:52.580
"&gt;&gt; And again, you won't at
first glance probably",00:49:52.580,00:49:54.230
understand how this is working.,00:49:54.230,00:49:55.620
"But everything that we sort of take
for granted in our modern lives",00:49:55.620,00:49:58.940
"actually tends to reduce even to some
of these fundamentals we've been",00:49:58.940,00:50:02.040
looking at.,00:50:02.040,00:50:02.820
"Let me go ahead and open one
other program, holloway.c.",00:50:02.820,00:50:06.680
"So this, too, is something you
shouldn't really know.",00:50:06.680,00:50:08.970
"Even none of the staff or I could
probably figure this out by looking at",00:50:08.970,00:50:12.440
"it because this was someone's code
that was submitted to what's",00:50:12.440,00:50:15.450
"historically known as an obfuscated C
contest, where you write a program",00:50:15.450,00:50:19.630
"that compiles and runs but is so damn
cryptic no human can understand what",00:50:19.630,00:50:24.670
"it's going to do until
they actually run it.",00:50:24.670,00:50:27.530
"&gt;&gt; So indeed, if you look at this
code, I see a switch.",00:50:27.530,00:50:29.940
I see main.,00:50:29.940,00:50:30.870
"I see these square brackets implying
some kind of an array.",00:50:30.870,00:50:33.800
"Does anyone want to guess what
this program actually",00:50:33.800,00:50:35.970
does if I run Holloway?,00:50:35.970,00:50:37.220
Yes.,00:50:39.940,00:50:40.750
OK.,00:50:40.750,00:50:43.050
Well done.,00:50:43.050,00:50:44.690
"So only the staff and I cannot figure
out what these things do.",00:50:44.690,00:50:48.090
"&gt;&gt; And now lastly, let me go ahead
and open up one other program.",00:50:48.090,00:50:51.670
This one--,00:50:51.670,00:50:53.440
"again, we'll make the source code
available online-- this one's just",00:50:53.440,00:50:55.550
kind of pretty to look at.,00:50:55.550,00:50:57.480
"All they did is hit the
space bar quite a bit.",00:50:57.480,00:50:59.750
But this is real code.,00:50:59.750,00:51:01.320
"So if you think that's pretty, if we
actually run this at the prompt,",00:51:01.320,00:51:04.790
"eventually you'll see how we
might do things like this.",00:51:04.790,00:51:08.970
"&gt;&gt; So we'll leave you on that note
and see you on Wednesday.",00:51:08.970,00:51:14.008
