PROFESSOR: Hi.,00:00:07.977,00:00:08.560
Welcome to recitation.,00:00:08.560,00:00:10.010
"My name is Martina, and I'll
be your recitation instructor",00:00:10.010,00:00:12.480
"for some of these
linear algebra videos.",00:00:12.480,00:00:14.940
"Today's problem is
a straightforward",00:00:14.940,00:00:16.740
"solve the following
linear system",00:00:16.740,00:00:18.580
"with four equations
and four unknowns,",00:00:18.580,00:00:20.600
using the method of elimination.,00:00:20.600,00:00:22.270
"The system is x minus y minus
z plus u equals 0, 2x plus 2z",00:00:22.270,00:00:28.220
"equals 8, minus y
minus 2z equals -8,",00:00:28.220,00:00:32.290
"and 3x minus 3y minus
2z plus 4u equals 7.",00:00:32.290,00:00:36.560
"And although you might
know different ways",00:00:36.560,00:00:38.310
"to solve the system
at this point,",00:00:38.310,00:00:39.984
"the method of
elimination is going",00:00:39.984,00:00:41.400
"to show up a million
times during these videos,",00:00:41.400,00:00:45.562
"so it's really important
to get it right.",00:00:45.562,00:00:47.270
"So I suggest you try solving
this system now, using",00:00:47.270,00:00:50.180
"the method of elimination as
it was described in class.",00:00:50.180,00:00:52.584
"I'm going to leave you
alone with the problem.",00:00:52.584,00:00:54.500
"You should pause the
video, solve it yourself,",00:00:54.500,00:00:56.860
"and then come back and compare
your solution with mine.",00:00:56.860,00:00:59.452
And we're back.,00:01:06.750,00:01:07.890
"So the method of elimination,
if you remember it from class,",00:01:07.890,00:01:11.560
"consisted of replacing this
system with an equivalent",00:01:11.560,00:01:14.410
"system-- equivalent meaning
they have the same solution--",00:01:14.410,00:01:17.390
by a series of row operations.,00:01:17.390,00:01:19.360
"Row operations are not
supposed to change the solution",00:01:19.360,00:01:22.060
to the system.,00:01:22.060,00:01:23.000
"And they're, for
example, exchange",00:01:23.000,00:01:24.860
the order of two equations.,00:01:24.860,00:01:26.320
"Multiply an equation
with a nonzero number,",00:01:26.320,00:01:29.000
"and add a nonzero multiple
of one equation to the other.",00:01:29.000,00:01:32.310
So let's do that.,00:01:32.310,00:01:33.950
"As we're going to do this
series of arithmetic operations,",00:01:33.950,00:01:36.537
"we don't really want
to copy the names",00:01:36.537,00:01:38.120
"of the variables and the
equality signs every time.",00:01:38.120,00:01:41.060
"So we're going to keep the
important information which",00:01:41.060,00:01:43.680
are these numbers.,00:01:43.680,00:01:45.380
"these coefficients
here, we're going",00:01:45.380,00:01:46.940
"to keep that
information in a matrix.",00:01:46.940,00:01:48.650
So let's write a matrix.,00:01:52.250,00:01:54.520
"Each row is going to
correspond to an equation,",00:01:54.520,00:01:56.930
"and each column is going to
correspond to an unknown.",00:01:56.930,00:01:59.850
"So the first row
is 1, -1, -1, 1.",00:01:59.850,00:02:09.220
"The second row, corresponding
to the second equation,",00:02:13.190,00:02:15.625
"is 2, 0, 2, 0.",00:02:15.625,00:02:24.450
"And you want to be very careful
to put 0's on the right spots",00:02:24.450,00:02:27.080
here.,00:02:27.080,00:02:28.560
"The third equation is
0-- I haven't left myself",00:02:28.560,00:02:31.550
"enough room-- 0, -1, -2, 0.",00:02:31.550,00:02:38.840
"And the fourth
row, corresponding",00:02:38.840,00:02:41.480
"to the fourth equation,
is 3, -3, -2, 4.",00:02:41.480,00:02:49.990
"And as we care about the
right-hand side as well,",00:02:49.990,00:02:52.360
"we're going to copy this
information as well,",00:02:52.360,00:02:54.770
"and get the augmented
matrix of the system.",00:02:54.770,00:02:57.230
"0, 8, -8, 7.",00:02:57.230,00:03:01.100
"OK, and now let's try
reducing this matrix",00:03:03.620,00:03:05.686
to an upper triangular one.,00:03:05.686,00:03:06.810
"We start with the
first column, and we're",00:03:10.102,00:03:11.810
"going to use this
number, called a pivot,",00:03:11.810,00:03:14.070
"to get rid of all
the numbers under it,",00:03:14.070,00:03:15.860
so to get 0's here and here.,00:03:15.860,00:03:18.650
"A way to do it is-- well,
to get rid of this 2,",00:03:18.650,00:03:23.230
"I have to multiply
the first row by -2,",00:03:23.230,00:03:26.400
and add it to the second one.,00:03:26.400,00:03:29.050
"Writing this here is
not strictly necessary,",00:03:29.050,00:03:30.990
"but I like to do a
bit of bookkeeping,",00:03:30.990,00:03:32.600
"because I'm prone to
make a lot of errors",00:03:32.600,00:03:35.040
"while doing this simple
arithmetic operations.",00:03:35.040,00:03:37.200
"And then if I get
to the end, figure",00:03:37.200,00:03:38.930
"out I made a mistake
somewhere, this bookkeeping",00:03:38.930,00:03:41.110
"makes it easier to
backtrack and find the place",00:03:41.110,00:03:43.680
where I made this mistake.,00:03:43.680,00:03:45.416
"So we replace this matrix
with another matrix.",00:03:45.416,00:03:48.650
The first row stays the same.,00:03:48.650,00:03:51.020
"1, -1, -1, 1, 0.",00:03:51.020,00:03:57.480
"The second row gets replaced
by the second row minus 2 times",00:03:57.480,00:04:01.500
the first row.,00:04:01.500,00:04:02.580
"The aim of that is to get
a 0 here, so that's good.",00:04:02.580,00:04:06.000
"Next, on this position
here, we get -2 times -1,",00:04:06.000,00:04:09.720
"which is 2, plus 0 which is 2.",00:04:09.720,00:04:13.640
"-1 times -2, which is
2, plus 2, which is 4.",00:04:13.640,00:04:20.339
-2 plus 0 which is -2.,00:04:20.339,00:04:23.700
"And 8 minus 2
times 0 which is 8.",00:04:23.700,00:04:27.512
"The third row
already has a 0 here,",00:04:27.512,00:04:29.630
so I can just copy it over.,00:04:29.630,00:04:31.360
"0, -1, -2, 0, -8.",00:04:31.360,00:04:37.380
"And to get a 0 here, I'm going
to multiply the first row by -3",00:04:37.380,00:04:42.940
"and add it to the fourth row
and get 0, -3 times -1 is 3,",00:04:42.940,00:04:50.560
minus 3 is 0.,00:04:50.560,00:04:53.880
"-3 minus 1-- oh, sorry-- 3 minus
2 is 1, and -3 plus 4 is 1.",00:04:53.880,00:05:04.100
And there we go.,00:05:09.524,00:05:10.190
"The first column looks
like a first column",00:05:10.190,00:05:12.280
of an upper triangular matrix.,00:05:12.280,00:05:14.200
"Now let's do the same
to the second column.",00:05:14.200,00:05:16.950
"This is going to be our
pivot, the number that we use",00:05:16.950,00:05:19.340
to get rid of numbers under it.,00:05:19.340,00:05:21.220
"And we see that to
get rid of this number",00:05:21.220,00:05:23.540
"here, we will need to
multiply it with 1/2.",00:05:23.540,00:05:28.270
"So multiply the whole
second row with 1/2,",00:05:28.270,00:05:30.220
and add it to the third row.,00:05:30.220,00:05:31.830
"The matrix that we get will
have the first row the same.",00:05:31.830,00:05:38.370
It stays the same.,00:05:38.370,00:05:39.910
"1, -1, -1, 1, 0.",00:05:39.910,00:05:48.360
The second row stays the same.,00:05:48.360,00:05:50.360
"0, 2, 4, -2, 8.",00:05:50.360,00:05:56.510
"The third row gets
replaced by the third row",00:05:59.100,00:06:01.720
"plus 1/2 times the second row
and becomes 0, 0, 2 minus 2",00:06:01.720,00:06:10.180
"which is 0, -1 plus 0 which is
-1, and 4 minus 8 which is -4.",00:06:10.180,00:06:22.970
"And the fourth row already has
a 0 here so I just copy it over.",00:06:22.970,00:06:28.230
"0, 0, 1, 1, 7.",00:06:28.230,00:06:34.544
"And now let's look
at this matrix.",00:06:34.544,00:06:35.960
"It has the first two columns
as they're supposed to be,",00:06:35.960,00:06:39.310
0's under the diagonal.,00:06:39.310,00:06:41.010
And now we want to get a 0 here.,00:06:41.010,00:06:43.480
"Normally what I would do is
to circle this number here,",00:06:43.480,00:06:47.120
"multiply it by something
so that I get a -1,",00:06:47.120,00:06:50.330
"and add it to this
row to get a 0 here.",00:06:50.330,00:06:53.440
But that's not going to work.,00:06:53.440,00:06:54.870
"You might remember from lecture
that 0's can never be pivots.",00:06:54.870,00:06:58.310
"Or you can just try finding
a number such that 0",00:06:58.310,00:07:01.020
"times this number
equals -1, and seeing",00:07:01.020,00:07:03.296
"that such a number
doesn't exist,",00:07:03.296,00:07:04.670
"because you're always
going to get 0.",00:07:04.670,00:07:06.500
"So we can proceed
as we did until now.",00:07:06.500,00:07:09.390
"But is there another
way to get a 0 here?",00:07:09.390,00:07:12.920
"There is a very
simple row operation,",00:07:12.920,00:07:17.690
"which consists just of switching
the third and the fourth row.",00:07:17.690,00:07:20.820
"It certainly doesn't change
the solution of the system.",00:07:20.820,00:07:23.380
So let's do that.,00:07:23.380,00:07:25.930
"And let's get the next matrix
which is 1, -1, -1, 1, 0.",00:07:25.930,00:07:35.770
"0, 2, 4, -2, 8.",00:07:35.770,00:07:42.250
Then we put the fourth row here.,00:07:42.250,00:07:43.790
"0, 0, 1, 1, 7.",00:07:43.790,00:07:47.920
"And we put the third row
here, 0, 0, 0, -1, -4.",00:07:47.920,00:07:54.050
And there it is.,00:07:59.740,00:08:01.590
"This is an upper
triangular matrix.",00:08:01.590,00:08:03.830
"So in the same way as at the
beginning, we had a system",00:08:03.830,00:08:06.560
"and then wrote the
matrix representing it,",00:08:06.560,00:08:08.600
"this matrix also
represents a system.",00:08:08.600,00:08:11.010
"And this system has the same
solutions as the initial system",00:08:11.010,00:08:13.740
but is much easier to solve.,00:08:13.740,00:08:15.400
"Now let's write this
back as a system,",00:08:15.400,00:08:18.257
"and let me do that not starting
from the first equation,",00:08:18.257,00:08:20.590
"but starting from
the last equation.",00:08:20.590,00:08:23.900
"So the last equation
here reads -u",00:08:23.900,00:08:30.030
"equals -4, which
is, as equations go,",00:08:30.030,00:08:36.770
a pretty easy one to solve.,00:08:36.770,00:08:39.530
The solution is u equals 4.,00:08:39.530,00:08:41.734
"Now let's go back to
the third equation.",00:08:41.734,00:08:43.400
"The third equation
reads y-- no, I'm",00:08:43.400,00:08:47.360
"sorry-- z-- the third column
corresponds to z-- plus u",00:08:47.360,00:08:57.670
equals 7.,00:08:57.670,00:08:59.410
But we know what's u now.,00:08:59.410,00:09:01.690
"So, it reads z plus 4 equals 7,
which just becomes z equals 3.",00:09:01.690,00:09:13.980
"The second equation is 2
times y plus 4 times z,",00:09:13.980,00:09:22.100
"but z is 3, minus 2 times
u, but u is 4, equals 8.",00:09:22.100,00:09:33.160
"And from this, one can easily
compute that y is equal to 2.",00:09:33.160,00:09:37.870
"And finally, the first equation
reads x minus y minus z plus u",00:09:37.870,00:09:52.200
"equals 0, or x equals 1.",00:09:52.200,00:09:58.770
And this is our solution.,00:09:58.770,00:09:59.980
"x, y, z, and u equal
1, 2, 3, and 4.",00:09:59.980,00:10:04.884
"This finishes the problem,
but I would very strongly",00:10:04.884,00:10:07.050
"encourage you now to
take this solution",00:10:07.050,00:10:09.610
"and plug it back into
the original system",00:10:09.610,00:10:11.510
"and check if it's
really a solution.",00:10:11.510,00:10:13.300
"And that's all I
wanted to say today.",00:10:13.300,00:10:15.960
