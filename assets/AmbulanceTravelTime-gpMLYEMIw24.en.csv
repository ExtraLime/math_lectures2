"In this problem, we'll be
looking at an ambulance that",00:00:00.890,00:00:03.020
"is traveling back and forth
in interval of size l.",00:00:03.020,00:00:06.790
Say from 0 to l.,00:00:06.790,00:00:09.030
"At some point in time, there's
an accident occurring, let's",00:00:09.030,00:00:11.900
say at location x.,00:00:11.900,00:00:14.070
"And we'll assume the accident
occurs in a random location so",00:00:14.070,00:00:16.940
"that x is uniformly distributed
between 0 and l.",00:00:16.940,00:00:21.540
"Now, at this point in time,
let's say the ambulance turns",00:00:21.540,00:00:24.280
out to be at location y.,00:00:24.280,00:00:26.640
"Again, we'll assume that y is
a uniform random variable",00:00:26.640,00:00:29.860
"between 0 and l, and also that
x and y are independently",00:00:29.860,00:00:34.110
distributed.,00:00:34.110,00:00:35.570
"The question we're interested
in answering is how long it",00:00:35.570,00:00:39.100
"would take an ambulance to
respond to travel from point y",00:00:39.100,00:00:42.760
to point x.,00:00:42.760,00:00:44.500
"Let's call this time T. And in
particular, we want to know",00:00:44.500,00:00:48.240
"everything about distribution of
T. For example, what is the",00:00:48.240,00:00:52.170
"CDF of T given by the
probability of big T, less",00:00:52.170,00:00:56.330
"than or equal to little t, or
the PDF, which is done by",00:00:56.330,00:01:00.710
"differentiating the CDF
once we have it.",00:01:00.710,00:01:03.680
"Now, to start, we'll express T
you as a function of X and Y.",00:01:03.680,00:01:08.850
"Since we know that
the ambulance",00:01:08.850,00:01:10.450
travels at a speed V--,00:01:10.450,00:01:13.301
"V meters or V units of
distance per second--",00:01:13.301,00:01:16.990
"then we can write that big T is
simply equal to Y minus X,",00:01:16.990,00:01:21.420
"absolute value the distance
between X and Y, divided by",00:01:21.420,00:01:25.160
"the speed at which the ambulance
is traveling at, V.",00:01:25.160,00:01:27.620
"So now if we look at the
probability of T less than or",00:01:27.620,00:01:32.910
"equal to little t, this is then
equal to the probability",00:01:32.910,00:01:36.950
"that Y minus X divided
by V less than or",00:01:36.950,00:01:40.720
equal to little t.,00:01:40.720,00:01:43.300
"We now take off the absolute
value by writing the",00:01:43.300,00:01:46.620
"expression as negative vt less
equal to Y minus X less equal",00:01:46.620,00:01:52.690
to positive vt.,00:01:52.690,00:01:55.060
"Here we multiply v on the other
side of t, and then took",00:01:55.060,00:01:59.350
out the absolute value sign.,00:01:59.350,00:02:02.210
"As a final step, we'll also move
X to the other side of",00:02:02.210,00:02:06.280
"inequalities by writing this as
X minus vt less equal to y",00:02:06.280,00:02:12.080
less equal to x plus vt.,00:02:12.080,00:02:16.560
"To compute this quantity, we'll
define a set A as a set",00:02:16.560,00:02:20.960
"of all points that satisfies
this condition right here.",00:02:20.960,00:02:24.870
"In particular, it's a pair of
all X and Y such that X minus",00:02:24.870,00:02:30.890
"vt less equal to little y less
equal to X plus vt, and also",00:02:30.890,00:02:37.580
"that X is within 0 and
l, and so is Y.",00:02:37.580,00:02:45.570
"So the set A will be the
set of values we'll",00:02:45.570,00:02:48.420
be integrating over.,00:02:48.420,00:02:50.040
"Now that we have A, we can
express the above probability",00:02:50.040,00:02:53.620
"as the integral of all X and Y,
this pair within the set A,",00:02:53.620,00:03:00.870
"integrating the PDF of f of
X, Y, little x, little y.",00:03:00.870,00:03:06.840
 ,00:03:06.840,00:03:12.100
"Let's now evaluate this
expression right here in a",00:03:12.100,00:03:15.130
graphical way.,00:03:15.130,00:03:16.460
"On the right, we're plotting out
what we just illustrated",00:03:16.460,00:03:19.710
"here, where the shaded region is
precisely the set A. As we",00:03:19.710,00:03:23.860
"can see, this is a set of values
of X and Y where Y is",00:03:23.860,00:03:27.930
"sandwiched between two lines,
the upper one being X plus vt",00:03:27.930,00:03:33.150
"right here, and the lower line
being X minus vt, right here.",00:03:33.150,00:03:39.190
"So these are the values that
correspond to the set A.",00:03:39.190,00:03:45.310
"Now that we have A, let's
look f of x, y.",00:03:45.310,00:03:48.250
"We know that both x and y are
uniform random variables",00:03:48.250,00:03:51.840
"between 0 and l, and therefore,
since they're",00:03:51.840,00:03:55.700
"independent, the probability
density of x and y being at",00:03:55.700,00:04:00.390
"any point between 0 and l is
precisely 1 over l squared,",00:04:00.390,00:04:06.000
"where l squared is the size of
this square box right here.",00:04:06.000,00:04:11.810
"So given this picture, all we
need to do is to multiply by 1",00:04:11.810,00:04:16.730
"over l squared the area of the
region A. And depending on the",00:04:16.730,00:04:25.940
"value of T, we'll get different",00:04:25.940,00:04:27.640
answers as right here.,00:04:27.640,00:04:30.010
"If T is less than 0, obviously,
the area of A",00:04:30.010,00:04:33.440
"diminishes to nothing,
so we get 0.",00:04:33.440,00:04:35.880
"If T is greater than l over V,
the area of A fills up the",00:04:35.880,00:04:40.180
"entire square, and we get 1.",00:04:40.180,00:04:42.830
"Now, if T is somewhere in
between 0 and l over v, we",00:04:42.830,00:04:46.570
"will have 1 over l squared,
multiply by the area looking",00:04:46.570,00:04:51.540
"like something like that right
here-- the shaded region.",00:04:51.540,00:04:55.440
"Now, if you wonder how we
arrive at exactly this",00:04:55.440,00:04:58.020
"expression right here, here is
a simple way to calculate it.",00:04:58.020,00:05:01.170
"What we want is 1 over l squared
times the area A. Now,",00:05:01.170,00:05:05.820
"area A can be viewed as the
entire square, l squared,",00:05:05.820,00:05:12.320
"minus whatever's not in area
A, which is these two",00:05:12.320,00:05:16.810
triangles right here.,00:05:16.810,00:05:19.990
"Now, each triangle has area
1/2, l minus vt squared.",00:05:19.990,00:05:27.090
"This multiply 2, and this, after
some algebra, will give",00:05:27.090,00:05:30.830
the answer right here.,00:05:30.830,00:05:33.270
"At this point, we have obtained
the probability of",00:05:33.270,00:05:35.660
big T less equal to little t.,00:05:35.660,00:05:37.470
"Namely, we have gotten the CDF
for T. And as a final step, we",00:05:37.470,00:05:43.425
"can also compute the probability
density function",00:05:43.425,00:05:46.430
"for T. We'll call it
little f of t.",00:05:46.430,00:05:50.720
"And we do so by simply
differentiating the CDF in",00:05:50.720,00:05:54.580
different regions of T.,00:05:54.580,00:05:57.270
"To begin, we'll look at t
between 0 and l over v right",00:05:57.270,00:06:01.670
"here at differentiating the
expression right here with",00:06:01.670,00:06:06.210
respect to t.,00:06:06.210,00:06:07.410
"And doing so will give
us 2v over l minus 2v",00:06:07.410,00:06:12.660
squared t over L squared.,00:06:12.660,00:06:16.350
"And this applies to t greater or
equal to 0, less than l/v.",00:06:16.350,00:06:22.350
"Now, any other region, either
t less than 0 or t greater",00:06:22.350,00:06:26.680
"than l/v, we have a constant
for the CDF, and hence its",00:06:26.680,00:06:32.860
derivative will be 0.,00:06:32.860,00:06:34.770
So this is for any other t.,00:06:34.770,00:06:37.246
We call it otherwise.,00:06:37.246,00:06:39.430
"Now, this completely
characterized the PDF of big",00:06:39.430,00:06:42.620
"T, and hence, we've also
finished a problem.",00:06:42.620,00:06:45.270
