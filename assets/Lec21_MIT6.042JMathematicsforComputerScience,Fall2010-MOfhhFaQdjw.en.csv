"PROFESSOR: So far in our
discussion of probability,",00:00:24.160,00:00:26.400
"we've focused our attention
on the probability",00:00:26.400,00:00:29.210
"that some kind of event
occurs-- the probability you",00:00:29.210,00:00:33.220
"win the Monty Hall game,
the probability that you get",00:00:33.220,00:00:36.600
"a heads when you flip a
coin, the probability we all",00:00:36.600,00:00:40.870
"have different birthdays in
the room-- that kind of thing.",00:00:40.870,00:00:44.570
"In each case, the event
happens or it doesn't.",00:00:44.570,00:00:47.760
It's a zero-one kind of thing.,00:00:47.760,00:00:50.630
"For the rest of
the course, we're",00:00:50.630,00:00:52.710
"going to start talking about
more complicated situations.",00:00:52.710,00:00:56.460
"Instead of talking
about zero-one events,",00:00:56.460,00:00:58.840
"like winning or
losing, we're going",00:00:58.840,00:01:00.890
"to start talking about
how much you win.",00:01:00.890,00:01:04.610
"Instead of talking
about whether or not",00:01:04.610,00:01:06.926
"you get a heads in
a coin flip, we're",00:01:06.926,00:01:08.970
"going to talk about
flipping lots of coins",00:01:08.970,00:01:10.930
"and asking how many
heads did you get?",00:01:10.930,00:01:16.080
"Now, this involves the
notion of a random variable",00:01:16.080,00:01:21.420
"to count how much or how
many in a random situation.",00:01:21.420,00:01:24.990
"And actually, the
name is sort of weird.",00:01:24.990,00:01:27.250
It's not a variable at all.,00:01:27.250,00:01:29.650
"In fact, a random variable
is a function from the sample",00:01:29.650,00:01:33.080
space to the real numbers.,00:01:33.080,00:01:34.190
"See random variable R is a
function R from the sample",00:01:45.390,00:01:56.220
space to the reals.,00:01:56.220,00:02:00.512
"So this is the random
variable, and we'll often",00:02:00.512,00:02:02.470
denote that by rv.,00:02:02.470,00:02:05.040
"This is the sample space
of all possible outcomes.",00:02:05.040,00:02:07.980
And this is just the reals.,00:02:11.190,00:02:12.460
"All right, so in other
words, a random variable",00:02:17.460,00:02:19.600
"is just a way of
assigning a real number",00:02:19.600,00:02:22.150
to each possible outcome.,00:02:22.150,00:02:25.440
"For example, say that
we toss three coins.",00:02:25.440,00:02:28.085
"We could let R equal the number
of heads among the three coins.",00:02:36.560,00:02:45.080
And R is thus a random variable.,00:02:45.080,00:02:47.040
"For example, for the outcome
where the first coin is heads,",00:02:47.040,00:02:51.920
"the second is tails,
and the third is heads,",00:02:51.920,00:02:54.050
"R would be the real
number 2, indicating I",00:02:54.050,00:02:57.610
got two heads in that outcome.,00:02:57.610,00:02:59.310
"We could also define another
value called M, which we'll say",00:03:02.160,00:03:07.300
"is 1 if all three coins match,
if they're all the same,",00:03:07.300,00:03:16.680
"and 0 otherwise, if
they're not all the same.",00:03:16.680,00:03:19.987
"For example, M on the outcome
heads, heads, tails is 0.",00:03:23.400,00:03:32.780
"M on the outcome
tails, tails, tails",00:03:32.780,00:03:36.190
"would be 1, because
they all are the same.",00:03:36.190,00:03:38.120
Is M a random variable?,00:03:40.930,00:03:42.120
"Yeah, it assigns a value, a
real number, to every outcome.",00:03:45.480,00:03:49.370
"And that value is
either 0 or 1, depending",00:03:49.370,00:03:52.110
on if all the coins match.,00:03:52.110,00:03:53.980
"In fact, it's a very special
kind of random variable",00:03:53.980,00:03:56.870
"that's called an indicator
random variable, also",00:03:56.870,00:03:59.520
"known as Bernoulli or
characteristic random variable,",00:03:59.520,00:04:03.820
because it's zero-one.,00:04:03.820,00:04:05.270
"An indicator also
known as a Bernoulli",00:04:08.860,00:04:21.209
"or characteristic
random variable,",00:04:21.209,00:04:35.890
"is a random variable whose
range or possible values",00:04:35.890,00:04:44.130
is just 0 and 1.,00:04:44.130,00:04:47.910
"So it's a random variable
where the real numbers",00:04:47.910,00:04:50.030
"are 0, 1 that you assign
to every sample point.",00:04:50.030,00:04:53.140
"And it's called a characteristic
or indicator random variable",00:04:53.140,00:04:56.920
"because it indicates
which sample points have",00:04:56.920,00:05:00.660
a certain property.,00:05:00.660,00:05:02.430
"In this case, all the
coins were the same.",00:05:02.430,00:05:05.480
"Or it indicates
that a sample point",00:05:05.480,00:05:07.310
"has a certain
characteristic, which",00:05:07.310,00:05:09.110
"is why it's called a
characteristic random variable.",00:05:09.110,00:05:11.742
"And we're going to
be talking a lot",00:05:11.742,00:05:13.200
"about these kinds
of random variables",00:05:13.200,00:05:14.800
over the next couple of weeks.,00:05:14.800,00:05:17.760
"Now, in general, a random
variable is equivalent to,",00:05:17.760,00:05:21.440
"or it can define a partition
on the sample space.",00:05:21.440,00:05:26.470
"For an indicator
random variable,",00:05:26.470,00:05:29.710
"it defines a partition
with two blocks.",00:05:29.710,00:05:33.220
"For example, say we look at the
sample space with three coin",00:05:33.220,00:05:38.470
tosses there.,00:05:38.470,00:05:41.080
There's eight outcomes.,00:05:41.080,00:05:42.180
"There's heads, heads,
heads; heads, tails, heads;",00:05:42.180,00:05:50.400
"heads, heads, tails;
tail, heads, heads;",00:05:50.400,00:05:55.556
and the reverse of those.,00:05:55.556,00:05:56.835
"This is the sample space
when I toss three coins.",00:06:04.470,00:06:07.180
There's eight possible outcomes.,00:06:07.180,00:06:09.940
"The random variable M
defines this partition.",00:06:09.940,00:06:12.845
"Up top, you have M equals 1, and
down below you have M equals 0.",00:06:15.700,00:06:20.790
"Because these are the outcomes
where all the coins match.",00:06:20.790,00:06:23.450
These are the ones that don't.,00:06:23.450,00:06:24.700
"The random variable R defines
a different partition.",00:06:27.820,00:06:30.775
"In that case, the
partition has four blocks.",00:06:33.740,00:06:38.320
"Here is R equals 0, no heads.",00:06:38.320,00:06:44.860
"This is R equals 1, to one head.",00:06:44.860,00:06:48.660
"R equals 2, and R equals 3.",00:06:48.660,00:06:51.340
"So a random variable just sort
of organizes your sample space,",00:06:54.460,00:06:58.750
"partitions it into
blocks, defined",00:06:58.750,00:07:01.450
"by all the elements
in the block,",00:07:01.450,00:07:03.560
"the outcomes in the
block have the same value",00:07:03.560,00:07:05.976
for the random variable.,00:07:05.976,00:07:06.975
"And, in fact, every
block is really an event.",00:07:09.500,00:07:14.000
"In particular, we
can say that, if you",00:07:14.000,00:07:17.040
"look at the outcomes for
which the random variable",00:07:17.040,00:07:21.530
"on that outcome
equals some value x,",00:07:21.530,00:07:24.830
"this is simply the
event that R equals x.",00:07:24.830,00:07:32.160
The random variable is x.,00:07:32.160,00:07:34.900
"And, of course, an event is just
a subset of the sample space.",00:07:34.900,00:07:37.490
"It's a collection of outcomes
that define the event.",00:07:37.490,00:07:40.345
"And since we know we could talk
about probabilities of events,",00:07:42.890,00:07:45.870
we can now say things like this.,00:07:45.870,00:07:47.900
"We can say the probability
that a random variable equals",00:07:47.900,00:07:52.610
"x is simply the probability
of that event happening, which",00:07:52.610,00:07:57.950
"is the sum over all outcomes
for which the random variable",00:07:57.950,00:08:03.890
"equals x for that outcome,
summing its probability.",00:08:03.890,00:08:08.850
"So the probability that the
random variable equals a value",00:08:08.850,00:08:12.060
"is the sum of the probabilities
of the sample points",00:08:12.060,00:08:14.500
for which R has that value.,00:08:14.500,00:08:17.500
"All right, this is all
really basic stuff,",00:08:17.500,00:08:19.250
but important to get down.,00:08:19.250,00:08:23.200
"So, for example,
what's the probability",00:08:23.200,00:08:26.960
"that R equals 2 in our
case with the three coins?",00:08:26.960,00:08:31.372
"You flip three coins-- let's say
the coins are fair and mutually",00:08:31.372,00:08:35.090
independent.,00:08:35.090,00:08:35.860
We probably need to know that.,00:08:35.860,00:08:38.720
"What is the
probability R equals 2?",00:08:38.720,00:08:41.675
AUDIENCE: 3/8?,00:08:41.675,00:08:42.950
"PROFESSOR: 3/8, because you've
got three outcomes, each",00:08:42.950,00:08:47.780
with a probability 1/8.,00:08:47.780,00:08:50.050
"All right, so by
this definition, that",00:08:50.050,00:08:52.590
"would be the same as the
probability of heads, heads,",00:08:52.590,00:08:56.640
"tails; heads, tails,
heads; tails, heads,",00:08:56.640,00:09:01.240
heads; that's 3/8.,00:09:01.240,00:09:03.160
"What's the probability
that M equals 1?",00:09:06.760,00:09:10.660
"What's the probability
that M equals 1?",00:09:16.928,00:09:19.300
M is 1 if all the coins match.,00:09:19.300,00:09:23.050
"1/4 because you've got two
cases there-- heads, heads,",00:09:23.050,00:09:27.360
"heads-- whoops--
or tails, tails,",00:09:27.360,00:09:31.720
"tails; and that's 2/8, or 1/4.",00:09:31.720,00:09:36.982
"Now we can also talk
about the probability",00:09:36.982,00:09:39.840
"that a random variable
is in some range.",00:09:39.840,00:09:43.930
"For example, I could ask,
what's the probability",00:09:43.930,00:09:47.180
that R is at least 2?,00:09:47.180,00:09:49.925
"All right, that would mean the
sum i equals 2 to infinity,",00:09:52.525,00:09:58.340
the probability R equals i.,00:09:58.340,00:10:02.230
And what is that?,00:10:02.230,00:10:03.035
What's the probability?,00:10:05.930,00:10:07.150
R is at least 2.,00:10:07.150,00:10:09.740
1/2.,00:10:09.740,00:10:10.480
"It's the probability
that R equals 2,",00:10:10.480,00:10:12.469
"plus the probability
that R equals 3.",00:10:12.469,00:10:14.010
"There's four outcomes there,
each with 1/8, so that's 1/2.",00:10:14.010,00:10:16.840
"And finally, we can talk
about the probability",00:10:21.300,00:10:24.030
that R is in some set of values.,00:10:24.030,00:10:28.770
"So we could say, for
example, for any subset",00:10:28.770,00:10:34.670
"of the real numbers, we
define the probability",00:10:34.670,00:10:38.830
"that R attains a value
in that set is simply",00:10:38.830,00:10:44.100
"the sum over all possible
values in the set,",00:10:44.100,00:10:50.660
"that the probability
R equals that value.",00:10:50.660,00:10:52.570
"So we could ask, what's the
probability that, say, we",00:10:55.570,00:11:00.170
"take A being the set 1, 3.",00:11:00.170,00:11:04.950
"I could ask for
the probability R",00:11:04.950,00:11:08.120
"is A when it's 1, 3, which is
the same as the probability",00:11:08.120,00:11:13.380
R is odd.,00:11:13.380,00:11:15.220
"Because Our could
only be 0, 1, 2, or 3.",00:11:15.220,00:11:18.210
"What's the probability R
is odd in this example?",00:11:18.210,00:11:24.494
"Flip three coins, we're
asking the probability",00:11:24.494,00:11:26.410
"you get an odd number of
heads-- one or three heads.",00:11:26.410,00:11:31.240
1/2.,00:11:31.240,00:11:32.650
"Again, you've got four sample
points-- here and there.",00:11:32.650,00:11:40.057
So that's 1/2.,00:11:40.057,00:11:40.640
"All right, any questions
about the definition?",00:11:44.820,00:11:48.125
"All right, now, we're only
going to worry about the case",00:11:51.210,00:11:54.130
"when random variables
are discrete.",00:11:54.130,00:11:58.100
"Namely, there's a
finite number of values.",00:11:58.100,00:12:02.940
"If you have continuous random
variables, which they'll",00:12:02.940,00:12:05.190
"deal with in other
courses, instead",00:12:05.190,00:12:06.550
"of doing sums and
stuff like that,",00:12:06.550,00:12:08.010
you're working with integrals.,00:12:08.010,00:12:09.260
"But for this course, it's
going to be all countable sets,",00:12:09.260,00:12:12.840
and usually often finite sets.,00:12:12.840,00:12:16.770
"Now, conditional probability
carries over very nicely",00:12:16.770,00:12:21.300
to random variables as well.,00:12:21.300,00:12:22.690
"For example, we could
write down the probability",00:12:22.690,00:12:27.160
"that R equals 2 given that M
equals 1, where R and M are",00:12:27.160,00:12:33.974
"the same random variables
we've been looking at when",00:12:33.974,00:12:36.140
you flip the three coins.,00:12:36.140,00:12:38.340
What is that probability?,00:12:38.340,00:12:40.830
"0, the probability of getting
exactly two heads when they're",00:12:40.830,00:12:43.960
"all the same, can't happen.",00:12:43.960,00:12:46.210
It's 0.,00:12:46.210,00:12:46.990
"You can either have
three heads or no heads.",00:12:46.990,00:12:50.590
So that's 0.,00:12:50.590,00:12:51.380
"The notion of independence
also carries over",00:12:54.920,00:12:57.852
"to random variables,
but you've got",00:12:57.852,00:12:59.310
to be a little careful here.,00:12:59.310,00:13:00.530
"Two random variables,
R1 and R2, are",00:13:06.670,00:13:12.870
"said to be independent if-- and
this is a little complicated--",00:13:12.870,00:13:26.070
"for all possible
values, x1 and x2",00:13:26.070,00:13:31.392
"in the real numbers, the
probability that R1 is x1,",00:13:31.392,00:13:40.290
"given that R2 is x2, is the
same as the probability of R1",00:13:40.290,00:13:46.580
"equals x1 not knowing
anything about R2.",00:13:46.580,00:13:48.910
"Or there's a special case
when this can't happen.",00:13:54.060,00:13:57.610
"Namely, the probability
that R2 equals x2 is 0.",00:13:57.610,00:14:02.190
"So, for two random
variables to be independent,",00:14:05.020,00:14:08.830

no matter what happens out here",00:14:08.830,00:14:12.720

you know about it,",00:14:12.720,00:14:15.910
"it can't influence
the probability for R1",00:14:15.910,00:14:19.740
to equal anything.,00:14:19.740,00:14:22.030
"So no value of R2
influences any value of R1.",00:14:22.030,00:14:27.790
"So it's the strongest possible
thing with independence",00:14:27.790,00:14:31.180
"for it to apply to
random variables.",00:14:31.180,00:14:33.946
"And there's an
equivalent definition,",00:14:33.946,00:14:36.570
"and we're going to use these
interchangeably, just as there",00:14:36.570,00:14:39.260
"were two definitions for
independence of events,",00:14:39.260,00:14:43.010
there's the product for them.,00:14:43.010,00:14:45.840
"So the equivalent
definitions says",00:14:45.840,00:14:48.890
"for all x1 and x2 in the
real numbers, the probability",00:14:48.890,00:14:55.500
"that R1 equals x1 and
R2 equals x2 is simply",00:14:55.500,00:15:02.550
"the product of
those probabilities.",00:15:02.550,00:15:05.680
"Probability R1 equals x1 times
the probability R2 equals x2.",00:15:05.680,00:15:12.410
"And you don't have to
worry about that case",00:15:15.029,00:15:16.820
where R2 being x2 is 0.,00:15:16.820,00:15:19.980
"So we can use both of those
as definitions of independence",00:15:19.980,00:15:24.490
of random variables.,00:15:24.490,00:15:27.550
"All right, so let's
see an example.",00:15:27.550,00:15:29.430

about two random variables.",00:15:29.430,00:15:33.500
"Are they independent
random variables?",00:15:33.500,00:15:36.320
"M is the indicated
random variable",00:15:40.610,00:15:42.790
for all the coins matching.,00:15:42.790,00:15:44.630
"R is the random variable
that tells us how many heads",00:15:44.630,00:15:47.180
there were in three coins.,00:15:47.180,00:15:49.210
Are they independent?,00:15:49.210,00:15:50.790
AUDIENCE: No.,00:15:50.790,00:15:51.510
"PROFESSOR: No, why not?",00:15:51.510,00:15:54.024
"AUDIENCE: Because information
with what one is narrows down",00:15:54.024,00:15:57.293
[INAUDIBLE].,00:15:57.293,00:15:57.934
"PROFESSOR: Yes, that's true.",00:15:57.934,00:15:59.100
"Information about
what one value is",00:15:59.100,00:16:01.560
"influences the probability
that the other guy",00:16:01.560,00:16:04.210
has a certain value.,00:16:04.210,00:16:05.240
"In particular, we can
find a case of x1 and x2",00:16:05.240,00:16:09.030
where this fails.,00:16:09.030,00:16:11.020
"One case would be
the probability",00:16:11.020,00:16:12.910
"of what we've already done,
that R equals 2 and M equals 1.",00:16:12.910,00:16:21.036
What was this probability?,00:16:21.036,00:16:23.930
0.,00:16:23.930,00:16:24.650
"If everything matches,
you can't have two heads.",00:16:24.650,00:16:26.780
That's 0.,00:16:26.780,00:16:28.110
"That does not equal
the probability",00:16:28.110,00:16:31.220
"of two heads times the
probability they all match.",00:16:31.220,00:16:36.580
"Because this probability,
two heads is 3/8,",00:16:36.580,00:16:40.550
"probability they
all match is 1/4.",00:16:40.550,00:16:43.045
And 3/8 times a 1/4 is not 0.,00:16:43.045,00:16:47.510
So R and M are not independent.,00:16:47.510,00:16:49.730
"OK, now in general to
show two random variables",00:16:57.470,00:17:00.560
"are not independent,
all you gotta",00:17:00.560,00:17:03.070
"do is find one pair of [? out ?]

"So it's harder show
independence in general.",00:17:15.390,00:17:17.480
"All right, let's
do another example,",00:17:20.720,00:17:24.588
get a little practice with this.,00:17:24.588,00:17:26.569
"Say we have two fair independent

"that the first
die has any value.",00:18:09.020,00:18:12.690

another value, S,",00:18:12.690,00:18:15.500
"to be D1 plus D2,
the sum of the dice.",00:18:15.500,00:18:19.825

"a number between 2 and 12, OK?",00:18:36.026,00:18:41.700
Let's do another one.,00:18:41.700,00:18:43.560
"Let's let T be 1 if S is 7,

"In particular now,
this can't be 12.",00:20:45.306,00:20:49.230
"So what I could do is say
the probability that S",00:20:49.230,00:20:51.570
"equals 12 and the first die

equal the probability",00:21:01.300,00:21:03.980
"S is 12 times the probability
the first die was 1.",00:21:03.980,00:21:08.380
"Or we could plug it into
the other definition.",00:21:11.240,00:21:13.690
"The probability that S equals
12 given the first die is 1",00:21:13.690,00:21:18.290
"is not equal to the
probability S equals 12.",00:21:18.290,00:21:21.440
"And, in fact, probability
the first die is 1 is not 0.",00:21:21.440,00:21:24.510
"So either definition,
of course, works",00:21:24.510,00:21:26.750
to show that they are dependent.,00:21:26.750,00:21:29.630
So S and D1 are dependent.,00:21:29.630,00:21:31.350

one possible pair",00:21:35.800,00:21:38.430

That's usually easy to do.,00:21:40.360,00:21:41.660
"All right, what about
D1, the first die, and T,",00:21:46.350,00:21:52.700

"Are D1 and T independent
random variables?",00:21:59.150,00:22:03.310
"All right, somebody's
shaking their head no.",00:22:05.815,00:22:08.860
"They seem to be dependent
because knowing the first die",00:22:08.860,00:22:12.430
"seems like it should tell you
something about the probability",00:22:12.430,00:22:15.660
of getting a 7 for the sum.,00:22:15.660,00:22:19.930
That's a good first intuition.,00:22:19.930,00:22:22.140

be, but 7 is not.",00:22:41.540,00:22:44.380

PROFESSOR: 6/36.,00:23:27.240,00:23:28.670
There's six ways to do it.,00:23:28.670,00:23:30.160
"1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 4, 4
and 3, 5 and 2, and 6 and 1,",00:23:30.160,00:23:35.880
"out of 36 possibilities
equally likely.",00:23:35.880,00:23:39.370
So that worked here.,00:23:39.370,00:23:42.670

"Probability of getting a 7 given
that your first die is a 2.",00:23:53.740,00:23:58.310

have the second die be a 5,",00:23:58.310,00:24:02.720
and that happens 1/6.,00:24:02.720,00:24:05.670

keep on going here.",00:24:08.740,00:24:11.800
"Probability T equals 1,
given D1 is anything, 6.",00:24:11.800,00:24:18.560

value of D1, there's",00:24:18.560,00:24:20.450
"exactly one value of
D2 that adds to a 7.",00:24:20.450,00:24:25.690

the probability of getting",00:24:25.690,00:24:31.060
the 7 in the first place.,00:24:31.060,00:24:33.770

it works every time.,00:25:25.710,00:25:28.050

to get more than a 6.",00:25:41.040,00:25:42.960

x1, and R2 is x2, and Rn is xn",00:27:08.650,00:27:19.170
"equals the product of the
individual probabilities.",00:27:19.170,00:27:21.450
"It's the natural generalization
for two variables.",00:27:30.880,00:27:35.420
"And there's also
the equivalent form",00:27:35.420,00:27:37.950
"in conditional probabilities,
but that's a little harrier",00:27:37.950,00:27:40.665
"to write down, and we
generally don't work with that.",00:27:40.665,00:27:43.710
"Any questions about
mutual independence?",00:27:49.880,00:27:54.340
Yeah.,00:27:54.340,00:27:55.227
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:27:55.227,00:27:56.143
PROFESSOR: So any subset what?,00:28:04.173,00:28:05.664
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:28:05.664,00:28:06.580
"PROFESSOR: Yes, in
the conditional form",00:28:09.860,00:28:11.720
"you check any subset,
here you don't have",00:28:11.720,00:28:15.770
to worry about the subsets.,00:28:15.770,00:28:16.940
"You take any possible
value for all of them,",00:28:16.940,00:28:20.550
"so there's no subset
notation in this version,",00:28:20.550,00:28:24.290
so you can do without it.,00:28:24.290,00:28:25.706
"That would be
equivalent, there's",00:28:25.706,00:28:27.080
"another form where you look
at all the possible subsets",00:28:27.080,00:28:29.371
"as well, and
conditioning on that.",00:28:29.371,00:28:31.030
"But this is good enough,
and this is probably",00:28:31.030,00:28:32.932
"the simplest way to do
the mutual independence,",00:28:32.932,00:28:34.890
is like this.,00:28:34.890,00:28:36.150
"So every variable
is included here.",00:28:36.150,00:28:38.850
"And that will imply the
same thing for any subset.",00:28:38.850,00:28:41.950
"You don't have to check
every subset here.",00:28:41.950,00:28:45.380
"And then you could do
that by just summing",00:28:45.380,00:28:47.620
"over Rn being everything,
and that cancels away",00:28:47.620,00:28:51.560
to get rid of items.,00:28:51.560,00:28:53.016
"But you don't have
to worry about that.",00:28:53.016,00:28:54.640
"OK, so we're going to
change gears a little bit",00:28:58.020,00:29:00.540
"now, and talk about the
probability distribution",00:29:00.540,00:29:06.990
"function, which is just
a way a sort of writing",00:29:06.990,00:29:10.600
"down or characterizing the
probabilities associated",00:29:10.600,00:29:14.860
with each value being attained.,00:29:14.860,00:29:16.625
"So given a random variable,
R, the probability",00:29:21.920,00:29:33.690
"also known as the point,
distribution function,",00:29:33.690,00:29:53.360
"also denoted pdf, probability
distribution function, for R",00:29:53.360,00:30:01.580
"is, well, it's very simple.",00:30:01.580,00:30:03.700
"It's just the function
f of x, which equals",00:30:03.700,00:30:07.940
the probability that R is x.,00:30:07.940,00:30:11.320
Very simple.,00:30:11.320,00:30:12.940
"But now we're characterizing
it as a function.",00:30:12.940,00:30:17.170
"And there's also a notion of
the cumulative distribution",00:30:17.170,00:30:20.320
"function, which is going to
be the probability that R",00:30:20.320,00:30:24.830
is less than or equal to x.,00:30:24.830,00:30:27.130
Let's write that down.,00:30:27.130,00:30:28.231
"The cumulative
distribution function F",00:30:52.800,00:31:12.500
"for random variable
R is simply f",00:31:12.500,00:31:19.820
"of x is the probability that
R is at most x, which is just",00:31:19.820,00:31:25.840
"the sum over all y
less than or equal to x",00:31:25.840,00:31:30.730
the probability R equals y.,00:31:30.730,00:31:32.510
"So the distribution functions
characterize the probability",00:31:35.480,00:31:40.930
"a random variable
takes on any value,",00:31:40.930,00:31:43.560
"and there's certain common ones
that just come up all the time.",00:31:43.560,00:31:47.400
"And so people have
done a lot of analysis",00:31:47.400,00:31:49.190
"about them because they
occur so frequently.",00:31:49.190,00:31:52.990
"And we're going to talk
about three of them today.",00:31:52.990,00:31:56.110
"The first is really
simple, and that",00:32:02.830,00:32:06.860
"is the Bernoulli
random variable,",00:32:06.860,00:32:10.000
or indicator random variable.,00:32:10.000,00:32:11.820
"All right, so for an indicator
random variable, f 0 is p,",00:32:14.430,00:32:29.520
"and f 1 is 1 minus p, for sum p.",00:32:29.520,00:32:36.290
"The probability could be half,
if you're flipping a coin.",00:32:36.290,00:32:38.817
"The probability of heads could
be a half, probability of tails",00:32:38.817,00:32:41.400
would be a half.,00:32:41.400,00:32:42.066
"It's just two values, 0 and 1.",00:32:42.066,00:32:45.360
"And then the cumulative
function is very simple.",00:32:45.360,00:32:48.770
"F 0 is p, big F of 1 is 1.",00:32:48.770,00:32:53.130
"So that is about as simple
of functions as you can get.",00:32:55.710,00:32:58.225
"The next simplest,
and also very common,",00:33:03.670,00:33:07.390
"is called a uniform
random variable.",00:33:07.390,00:33:10.370
Let's define that.,00:33:14.970,00:33:16.380
"For a uniform random
variable-- and we",00:33:26.300,00:33:32.610
"have to define what
it's defined on--",00:33:32.610,00:33:35.000
"on say the integers from 1 to n,
every value is equally likely.",00:33:35.000,00:33:42.900
"All the integers from 1 to n
are equally likely to occur.",00:33:42.900,00:33:46.600
"And so in this case, n is a
parameter of the function.",00:33:46.600,00:33:51.470
fn of K is simply 1/n.,00:33:51.470,00:33:54.750
"Each integer from 1 to
n is equally likely.",00:33:54.750,00:33:57.860
So it's 1 and n.,00:33:57.860,00:33:59.260
"All right, what is the
cumulative distribution",00:34:03.990,00:34:06.360
function for this?,00:34:06.360,00:34:08.920
"What is big F of n
of K for the uniform?",00:34:08.920,00:34:13.989
"The probability that
the random variable",00:34:13.989,00:34:18.350
takes a value that's at most K?,00:34:18.350,00:34:22.518

"PROFESSOR: Close, K/n.",00:34:24.449,00:34:27.199
"And you could
think of K being 1.",00:34:27.199,00:34:30.139
"You have a least the
1 over n probability.",00:34:30.139,00:34:33.469
So you have K chances.,00:34:33.469,00:34:35.290
"It could be 1, 2, 3, 4 up
to K, each has a 1/n chance.",00:34:35.290,00:34:40.159

the definition",00:34:40.159,00:34:42.380
"is less than or
equal, not less than.",00:34:42.380,00:34:47.469
"Uniform distributions
come up all the time,",00:34:51.020,00:34:53.250
"rolling a fair die is uniform
on 1 through 6 for values.",00:34:53.250,00:34:59.460
"If I pick a random student
in the class, the chance",00:34:59.460,00:35:02.560
"I pick you is 1 in
the size of the class.",00:35:02.560,00:35:05.940
We have uniform sample spaces.,00:35:05.940,00:35:07.520
"Each outcome occurs
equally likely.",00:35:07.520,00:35:12.300
"All right, any
questions about uniform?",00:35:12.300,00:35:16.340
[INAUDIBLE],00:35:16.340,00:35:18.552

talking about uniform,",00:35:18.552,00:35:20.260
"I want to play a
game, whose optimal",00:35:20.260,00:35:24.970

turn out to be related",00:35:24.970,00:35:26.980
to uniform distributions.,00:35:26.980,00:35:30.120
Now the game works as follows.,00:35:30.120,00:35:33.750
"I'm going to have
two envelopes here.",00:35:33.750,00:35:37.890
"And inside each envelope,
I've written a number.",00:35:37.890,00:35:42.400
"And the number in
this case is a number",00:35:42.400,00:35:45.060
between 0 and 100 inclusive.,00:35:45.060,00:35:47.155
"It's not a random number,
because I wrote it,",00:35:50.710,00:35:54.090
"and maybe I'm not
such a nice guy.",00:35:54.090,00:35:56.600
"I might have picked nasty
numbers to write here.",00:35:56.600,00:35:59.230
"They are different, though.",00:35:59.230,00:36:00.910
"The numbers are different
in the envelopes.",00:36:00.910,00:36:04.060
"Now I'm going to pick a
volunteer from the class,",00:36:04.060,00:36:07.260
"and their job is to pick
the envelope with the bigger",00:36:07.260,00:36:10.630
number.,00:36:10.630,00:36:12.200
"And if they get the one
with the bigger number,",00:36:12.200,00:36:14.910
"then they get one of
these guys for ice cream.",00:36:14.910,00:36:19.520
"And if they don't get the
one with the bigger number,",00:36:19.520,00:36:22.910
"they get the nerd
pride pocket protector.",00:36:22.910,00:36:27.340
"Now, since you don't know
which number I put in which,",00:36:27.340,00:36:31.030
"50-50 if you get the prize,
the $10 gift certificate.",00:36:31.030,00:36:35.520
"So to give you a
little bit of an edge,",00:36:35.520,00:36:37.980
"I'm going to let you
open one of the envelopes",00:36:37.980,00:36:41.060
and see what number's there.,00:36:41.060,00:36:43.320
"Then you have to decide, do
you want the number you got,",00:36:43.320,00:36:46.780
"or do you want the
other envelope?",00:36:46.780,00:36:50.210
OK?,00:36:50.210,00:36:52.330
"Is the game clear,
what we're going to do?",00:36:52.330,00:36:54.850
"OK, so need a couple
of volunteers.",00:36:54.850,00:36:56.740

played before.",00:37:03.520,00:37:05.017

"Who hasn't played before, wants
to-- all right, come on up.",00:37:07.190,00:37:12.510
"Now you want to be thinking
about, boy, is there a strategy",00:37:12.510,00:37:15.641
here?,00:37:15.641,00:37:16.140
"Or is this just
dumb luck, 50-50?",00:37:16.140,00:37:17.660
"OK, what's your name?",00:37:20.960,00:37:21.965

two envelopes, Sean.",00:37:23.410,00:37:25.700
"They are numbers
between 0 and 100.",00:37:25.700,00:37:28.170
"And you can pick one, and
we'll reveal the number,",00:37:28.170,00:37:33.707

What are you going to do?,00:39:54.520,00:39:55.830
92.,00:39:55.830,00:39:57.300
"What should he do, guys?",00:39:57.300,00:39:58.540
AUDIENCE: Stay.,00:39:58.540,00:39:59.174
PROFESSOR: Stay.,00:39:59.174,00:39:59.840
Oh he's got a big number there.,00:39:59.840,00:40:02.780
You're going to switch?,00:40:02.780,00:40:04.160
You're giving up a 92?,00:40:04.160,00:40:06.670
"Ooh, you're sure?",00:40:06.670,00:40:09.480
You don't want the 92?,00:40:09.480,00:40:10.410
"How many people think
Drew is going to win?",00:40:13.140,00:40:15.641
AUDIENCE: He's trying to lose.,00:40:15.641,00:40:16.890
PROFESSOR: A couple people.,00:40:16.890,00:40:18.250
Let's see.,00:40:18.250,00:40:20.909
AUDIENCE: 91.,00:40:20.909,00:40:21.450
It's either 91 or 93.,00:40:24.366,00:40:26.320
"PROFESSOR: 93, how did you
know there was a bigger number?",00:40:26.320,00:40:29.870
"Wow, very good.",00:40:29.870,00:40:31.229
There you go.,00:40:31.229,00:40:31.770
What was your strategy?,00:40:31.770,00:40:33.500
"AUDIENCE: I figured you'd
probably pick them within 1.",00:40:33.500,00:40:36.580
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's good.",00:40:36.580,00:40:38.068
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:40:38.068,00:40:38.984
"PROFESSOR: Actually, they're
both [INAUDIBLE] to 93.",00:40:49.972,00:40:52.452
Would you still switch?,00:40:52.452,00:40:54.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:40:54.350,00:40:56.560
PROFESSOR: Still switch.,00:40:56.560,00:40:57.600
Hmm.,00:40:57.600,00:40:58.480
"All right, so is it 50-50 then?",00:40:58.480,00:41:00.518
"Because you see a 92 a 93,
you're switching either way.",00:41:00.518,00:41:03.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:41:03.410,00:41:04.300
PROFESSOR: 50-50.,00:41:04.300,00:41:05.635
"All right, how many
people still like 50-50?",00:41:05.635,00:41:07.670
He can't beat 50-50 here.,00:41:07.670,00:41:10.880
Any ideas?,00:41:10.880,00:41:11.380
Can you beat 50-50?,00:41:11.380,00:41:12.840
Yeah.,00:41:12.840,00:41:13.796
"AUDIENCE: I just pay
attention to your face.",00:41:13.796,00:41:16.664
"PROFESSOR: I guess
I gave it away.",00:41:16.664,00:41:19.391
"I think I've lost every bet
so far in the course here,",00:41:19.391,00:41:22.300
"even on Monty Hall, every time.",00:41:22.300,00:41:24.320
"So I guess I have a
tell or something here.",00:41:24.320,00:41:27.450
"Now, in fact, you
can beat 50-50.",00:41:27.450,00:41:31.210
The information is helpful.,00:41:31.210,00:41:32.530
"Now, just to be clear,
are these numbers",00:41:32.530,00:41:34.835
that I wrote down random?,00:41:34.835,00:41:37.760
No.,00:41:37.760,00:41:38.490
"No, I'm trying
not to give away--",00:41:38.490,00:41:40.100
"my ice cream bill is going
through the roof here.",00:41:40.100,00:41:42.180
I'm trying to make it hard.,00:41:42.180,00:41:43.320
They're very much not random.,00:41:43.320,00:41:45.570
"There were two
smalls and two bigs.",00:41:45.570,00:41:48.400
What is random here?,00:41:48.400,00:41:51.086
"AUDIENCE: Which
one he picked is.",00:41:51.086,00:41:52.460
"PROFESSOR: Which one he saw,
that's 50-50, effectively.",00:41:52.460,00:41:55.810
So that's random there.,00:41:55.810,00:41:58.920
"Now his strategy could also
be random, but it wasn't.",00:41:58.920,00:42:03.810
"His strategy was, if
he sees a big number,",00:42:03.810,00:42:05.710
"he's swapping, which is odd.",00:42:05.710,00:42:07.320
"Most people see the big
number, they want to keep it.",00:42:07.320,00:42:09.914
"You know, I'd have
done well today",00:42:09.914,00:42:11.330
"if I had a really big number
and a really small number,",00:42:11.330,00:42:13.621
"because then I would
have won both times.",00:42:13.621,00:42:15.470
"OK, so to see why there might
be a winning strategy, or better",00:42:19.560,00:42:23.530
"than 50-50, imagine
that I had been nice",00:42:23.530,00:42:27.510
"and put a very small
number in one envelope",00:42:27.510,00:42:30.020
"and a very big number
of the other envelope.",00:42:30.020,00:42:32.640
"Say I had a 5 in one
and a 92 in the other.",00:42:32.640,00:42:37.520
"Can you win then,
if you know that?",00:42:37.520,00:42:41.230
"OK, how do you win if
you know there's one less",00:42:41.230,00:42:43.280
than 10 and one bigger than 90?,00:42:43.280,00:42:46.100
Yeah?,00:42:46.100,00:42:47.247
"AUDIENCE: If you get the
one less than 10, switch.",00:42:47.247,00:42:49.330
"PROFESSOR: Yeah,
and you're going",00:42:49.330,00:42:50.705
to win with what probability?,00:42:50.705,00:42:52.820
1.,00:42:52.820,00:42:53.675
It's a certainty.,00:42:53.675,00:42:55.910
"All right, well, but
I'm not that nice, say.",00:42:55.910,00:43:03.700
"Say, though, there
is a threshold",00:43:03.700,00:43:06.190
"x, such that one of the
numbers is less than x,",00:43:06.190,00:43:10.720
"and one is bigger than
x, and you know x.",00:43:10.720,00:43:15.510
Can you win now?,00:43:15.510,00:43:16.330
"Say you know that one number
is less than 47 and 1/2,",00:43:19.600,00:43:22.750
"and one is bigger
than 47 and 1/2.",00:43:22.750,00:43:25.700
Can you win?,00:43:25.700,00:43:27.380
"Yeah, because if you get the
one less than 47 and 1/2,",00:43:27.380,00:43:31.030
you switch.,00:43:31.030,00:43:31.947
And otherwise you'll stay.,00:43:31.947,00:43:33.030
"So again, you win
with certainty.",00:43:33.030,00:43:36.240
"All right, that's good.",00:43:36.240,00:43:38.730
Is there always such an x?,00:43:38.730,00:43:40.130
"You may not know it, but
is there always such an x?",00:43:43.400,00:43:46.810
"Yeah, because the
numbers are different.",00:43:46.810,00:43:48.840
"Just pick up a real
number in between them.",00:43:48.840,00:43:51.080
"You know, with 92 and
93, there's 92 and 1/2,",00:43:51.080,00:43:54.110
is such an x.,00:43:54.110,00:43:55.670
"Now the only problem
is you don't know it.",00:43:55.670,00:43:59.470
"And there's no way to
figure it out that's",00:43:59.470,00:44:01.920
within the rules of the game.,00:44:01.920,00:44:04.580
"Now in life, if you
don't know something,",00:44:04.580,00:44:08.970
"and you can't figure it
out, what can you do?",00:44:08.970,00:44:12.870
AUDIENCE: Guess.,00:44:12.870,00:44:13.670
PROFESSOR: Guess it.,00:44:13.670,00:44:15.340
"All right, now this turns out
to be a really good thing to do,",00:44:15.340,00:44:18.080
"and especially good in a lot
of computer science situations.",00:44:18.080,00:44:21.757
"If you don't know it,
and you can't know it,",00:44:21.757,00:44:23.590
"well you could try to guess
and you might be right.",00:44:23.590,00:44:28.210
"Now, if you guess x
and you are right,",00:44:28.210,00:44:31.570
"what's your
probability of winning?",00:44:31.570,00:44:34.060
1.,00:44:34.060,00:44:35.970
"If you don't guess x, what's
your probability of winning?",00:44:35.970,00:44:40.220
"Say you guess wrong, but
you follow the rule that",00:44:40.220,00:44:44.100
"if it's less than what
you guessed, you swap it,",00:44:44.100,00:44:46.100
otherwise you don't.,00:44:46.100,00:44:47.560
"What's your probability
of winning that?",00:44:47.560,00:44:51.370
P?,00:44:51.370,00:44:51.960
"Well, yeah, what's P?",00:44:51.960,00:44:55.490
It's a nice value of P.,00:44:55.490,00:44:58.840
"You know, say you
guessed-- well,",00:44:58.840,00:45:00.900
"say you weren't paying
attention and you guessed 200.",00:45:00.900,00:45:04.719
"And your rule is, if you're
less than what you guessed,",00:45:04.719,00:45:07.010
"you're less than 200,
you swap, which means",00:45:07.010,00:45:09.650
you're just going to swap.,00:45:09.650,00:45:12.040
"And you started with a
random one, so what's",00:45:12.040,00:45:14.690
your chance of winning?,00:45:14.690,00:45:17.370
A half.,00:45:17.370,00:45:19.190
"So if you guessed wrong,
you didn't lose anything.",00:45:19.190,00:45:21.670
"You still win with
probability a half.",00:45:21.670,00:45:23.580
"If you guessed right, you
win with probability 1,",00:45:23.580,00:45:27.860
"and there's some chance
you guessed right,",00:45:27.860,00:45:29.610
"so now you've got a
strategy that beats 50-50,",00:45:29.610,00:45:33.250
because you guessed.,00:45:33.250,00:45:35.970
"OK, and this is a whole
field in computer science",00:45:35.970,00:45:39.040
"where you get randomized
algorithms, where",00:45:39.040,00:45:41.840
"this strategy depends on a
coin flip, on guessing a value.",00:45:41.840,00:45:46.760
"And it leads to getting
potentially a better outcome.",00:45:46.760,00:45:51.360
"All right, so let's
prove that now",00:45:51.360,00:45:53.260
"and see what the probability
is of winning with the guess",00:45:53.260,00:45:57.320
"strategy and what's
a good way to guess.",00:45:57.320,00:45:59.468
"So we're going to first
formalize our random protocol.",00:46:07.290,00:46:10.780
"All right, so if this
is the winning strategy,",00:46:21.350,00:46:30.500
"well first the envelopes
contain y and z,",00:46:30.500,00:46:42.020
"and they're in the
interval 0 to n.",00:46:42.020,00:46:45.730
"And y is going to
be less than z.",00:46:45.730,00:46:47.587
"That's how we're
going to define them.",00:46:47.587,00:46:49.170
"Now you don't know
y and z, but y",00:46:49.170,00:46:53.290
"is the smaller number in the
envelope, z is the larger.",00:46:53.290,00:46:56.730
"And in our example, n was 100.",00:46:56.730,00:47:01.230
"Now the player
chooses x randomly,",00:47:01.230,00:47:12.540
"uniformly among all the
possible half integers.",00:47:12.540,00:47:18.800
"So he might pick 1/2, he might
pick 1 and 1/2, 2 and 1/2,",00:47:21.520,00:47:26.230
all the way out to n minus 1/2.,00:47:26.230,00:47:29.844
"You know, because if the
player picks anything else,",00:47:29.844,00:47:32.010
it's useless.,00:47:32.010,00:47:33.500
He won't have a chance to win.,00:47:33.500,00:47:35.590
"But he might, in
the case of 5 and 6,",00:47:35.590,00:47:37.880
might have picked 5 and 1/2.,00:47:37.880,00:47:40.570
"And we're going to make our
random guess be equally likely",00:47:40.570,00:47:44.100
"among those n values, because
well he doesn't really",00:47:44.100,00:47:48.060
"know what the numbers are
I put in the envelopes.",00:47:48.060,00:47:52.290
"If he sees 6, he doesn't
know if it's 5 or it's 7, OK?",00:47:52.290,00:47:56.976
"So that's why we're going to
pick them all equally likely",00:47:56.976,00:47:59.350
and it's uniform.,00:47:59.350,00:48:00.058
"Now the player is hoping
that he picked a value that",00:48:02.860,00:48:07.850
"splits y and z, OK?",00:48:07.850,00:48:12.500
Because then he's going to win.,00:48:12.500,00:48:15.329
"If he picked an x between
the numbers in the envelopes,",00:48:15.329,00:48:17.620
"and follows the swap, if he got
the small number less than x,",00:48:17.620,00:48:21.860
"he's going to win, all right?",00:48:21.860,00:48:27.050
"Then the player opens a
random envelope, 50-50,",00:48:27.050,00:48:41.100
"to reveal a number r,
which is either y or z,",00:48:41.100,00:48:47.340
"but the player doesn't
know which one.",00:48:47.340,00:48:51.730
"So one of the numbers
gets revealed.",00:48:51.730,00:48:55.690
"And then the last step
is the player swaps",00:48:55.690,00:49:03.100
"if the number he revealed is
less than the guessed split",00:49:03.100,00:49:08.720
number.,00:49:08.720,00:49:09.220
"That's the strategy,
and it's a strategy",00:49:12.580,00:49:16.400
"that depends on a random
guess or a random number.",00:49:16.400,00:49:22.720
"So let's figure
out the probability",00:49:26.302,00:49:27.760
of winning with that strategy.,00:49:27.760,00:49:30.060
"And we're going to
use the tree method.",00:49:30.060,00:49:33.640
"Well, the first branch
in the tree method",00:49:33.640,00:49:37.410
"is whether or not--
where the guess wound up.",00:49:37.410,00:49:40.700
"And there's three cases
for how the guess did.",00:49:40.700,00:49:42.770
"You might have guessed
too low, in which case,",00:49:45.320,00:49:48.660
"x is less than y,
and y is less than z.",00:49:48.660,00:49:53.590
"You might have guessed
perfectly, in which case",00:49:53.590,00:49:57.130
"x is between y and z,
equals not possible.",00:49:57.130,00:50:02.570
"Or you might have
guessed too high,",00:50:02.570,00:50:04.840
"in which case y is less
than z is less than x.",00:50:04.840,00:50:08.470
"All right, so here's low,
here's high, and here's",00:50:08.470,00:50:13.545
"an OK guess, a good guess.",00:50:13.545,00:50:17.270
"Now what's the probability
you guessed low, that you",00:50:17.270,00:50:21.920
picked an x less than y?,00:50:21.920,00:50:25.130
"y is integers, x is
the half integers.",00:50:25.130,00:50:30.140
"What's the probability
to assign to that chance,",00:50:30.140,00:50:33.690
that you guessed low?,00:50:33.690,00:50:36.925
"You could use the value
of y in your answer.",00:50:36.925,00:50:39.547
"You don't know y, but we
can write it on the tree.",00:50:39.547,00:50:41.630
What if y was 1?,00:50:44.790,00:50:47.686
"The smallest number
in the envelopes",00:50:47.686,00:50:49.185
"is one, what's the probability
you guessed below 1?",00:50:49.185,00:50:54.310
"Not quite 0, one of your
possible end guesses",00:50:57.660,00:51:02.950
"would be too low,
namely, a half.",00:51:02.950,00:51:05.920
"If the smallest number
y were 2, what's",00:51:05.920,00:51:10.170
"the probability
you guess below 2?",00:51:10.170,00:51:13.340

"because each one
is 1 in n chance.",00:51:31.920,00:51:34.190

"What's the probability
your guess is good,",00:51:37.250,00:51:39.070

"Each could have been guessed
with probability 1/n.",00:51:56.910,00:51:59.792

got the first branch.",00:52:16.570,00:52:19.620

is the revealed value.",00:52:19.620,00:52:24.620

with probability a half.",00:52:59.870,00:53:02.790

thing we have to figure out",00:53:46.872,00:53:49.080
"is, do you swap?",00:53:49.080,00:53:49.995

bigger than my split value",00:53:59.460,00:54:04.240

"And so I am guessing I've
got the biggest value.",00:54:06.270,00:54:10.890
So I don't swap.,00:54:10.890,00:54:13.800

What about here?,00:54:18.340,00:54:19.060
Do I swap here?,00:54:19.060,00:54:20.140
"I open z, I saw z.",00:54:23.070,00:54:26.060
"z is bigger than what I
think the midpoint is,",00:54:26.060,00:54:29.890

the value I reveal",00:54:30.740,00:54:33.830

bigger than my midpoint,",00:54:37.142,00:54:40.270
I think I've got the big one.,00:54:40.270,00:54:42.256
So there's no swap.,00:54:42.256,00:54:45.794
What about here?,00:54:45.794,00:54:46.460
Do I swap here?,00:54:46.460,00:54:48.490
"Yes, here I swap

"something that's less
than my guessed midpoint,",00:54:50.360,00:54:52.714
"so I think I've got the small
one so I'm going to swap.",00:54:52.714,00:54:55.005
What about here?,00:54:59.060,00:54:59.750
Do I swap here?,00:54:59.750,00:55:01.620
"No swap, because I
opened up something",00:55:01.620,00:55:03.340
that's bigger than midpoint.,00:55:03.340,00:55:05.070
What about here?,00:55:05.070,00:55:07.080
I swap.,00:55:07.080,00:55:09.760
And what about here?,00:55:09.760,00:55:11.540
"Swap on both of them,
because both of them",00:55:11.540,00:55:13.532
"are smaller than my
guessed midpoint.",00:55:13.532,00:55:17.370
"All right, now let's figure
out if you won or you lost.",00:55:17.370,00:55:21.210
"So here I did not swap and I
started with a smaller value.",00:55:21.210,00:55:26.522
So what happened?,00:55:26.522,00:55:27.230
Did I win or lose?,00:55:27.230,00:55:29.715
Lose.,00:55:29.715,00:55:30.850
"I opened he smaller
value and did not swap.",00:55:30.850,00:55:33.550

I win.,00:55:35.970,00:55:36.650
"I open the bigger
value and did not swap.",00:55:36.650,00:55:40.020
Here what happened?,00:55:40.020,00:55:42.350
"Win, I opened the small value
when I swapped, that's a win.",00:55:42.350,00:55:45.950
Here?,00:55:45.950,00:55:48.330
"I opened the big
value, did not swap.",00:55:48.330,00:55:51.280
It's a win.,00:55:51.280,00:55:53.590
"Here I opened a small value
and swap, that's a win.",00:55:53.590,00:55:57.590
"And here I opened a big value
and swap, that's a lose.",00:55:57.590,00:56:02.812
"All right, now we can compute
the probability of winning.",00:56:02.812,00:56:05.610
"The probability of a win is
the sum of these four sample",00:56:08.240,00:56:12.540
"points-- y over 2n plus
z minus y over 2n plus",00:56:12.540,00:56:22.110
"z minus y-- whoops-- over
2n plus n minus z over 2n.",00:56:22.110,00:56:29.220
"That equals-- z cancels the
z, and a y cancels the y,",00:56:33.090,00:56:38.830
"so I've got n, one left,
n left, one z left,",00:56:38.830,00:56:44.820
and one negative y left over 2n.,00:56:44.820,00:56:49.730
And I can simplify that.,00:56:49.730,00:56:50.990
"N over 2n is 1/2, plus
now what's left over",00:56:50.990,00:56:55.420
is z minus y over 2n.,00:56:55.420,00:56:59.430
"And we know the z and y are
different by at least 1.",00:57:02.140,00:57:06.960
"So this is at least
1/2 plus 1 over 2n.",00:57:06.960,00:57:11.270
"And so if n is 100, you've got
a 50 and 1/2% chance of winning.",00:57:14.360,00:57:20.280
"If n is 10, the numbers
are from 0 to 10,",00:57:20.280,00:57:24.930
"you've got at least
a 55% chance to win,",00:57:24.930,00:57:28.220
"which is pretty high, OK?",00:57:28.220,00:57:31.430
Any questions here?,00:57:33.990,00:57:35.700
You see what's going on?,00:57:35.700,00:57:36.700
"So here's the zone
where you guessed right.",00:57:36.700,00:57:39.660
You get the win either way.,00:57:39.660,00:57:41.190
"Here you guess low, and it
doesn't make any difference.",00:57:41.190,00:57:43.630
You're 50-50.,00:57:43.630,00:57:44.940
"You guessed high and
you're 50-50 again.",00:57:44.940,00:57:48.690
So guessing helps.,00:57:48.690,00:57:52.920

"a random value of y
between 0 and n minus 1,",00:59:53.520,00:59:57.820

about this, and there's",01:00:01.217,01:00:03.050
"whole classes you can
take on game theory,",01:00:03.050,01:00:06.520

uniformly from 0 to n minus 1.",01:00:11.170,01:00:14.900

anything between 0 and 99,",01:00:14.900,01:00:18.510

bigger number's just one more.",01:00:18.510,01:00:22.550

49 and 1/2 and 50 and 1/2.",01:01:49.010,01:01:52.819

construed as that way.",01:01:52.819,01:01:54.610

randomly, and that sort",01:01:54.610,01:01:57.400

"There's the unbiased
binomial distribution",01:04:17.910,01:04:21.820

k is between 0 and n.",01:04:42.000,01:04:48.560

something happening.",01:05:20.640,01:05:23.330

case, you've got nnp.",01:05:23.330,01:05:26.560
"The unbiased case
corresponds to when p is 1/2.",01:05:26.560,01:05:30.750

"n minus k, and that's
just 2 to the minus n.",01:05:35.200,01:05:38.600

you an example why",01:05:46.330,01:05:50.100
"this is so important, why
it comes up all the time.",01:05:50.100,01:05:54.230

in the number of failures,",01:06:47.450,01:06:51.400

you've got n components.",01:07:51.920,01:07:55.000

first component,",01:07:55.000,01:07:57.180
and that can fail or not.,01:07:57.180,01:08:00.480

second component.",01:08:05.710,01:08:08.132

you get to the nth component.",01:08:20.210,01:08:22.733

probability p or 1 minus p,",01:08:27.229,01:08:32.850

vectors of failure or not.",01:08:47.120,01:08:54.160

work on this formula.",01:15:50.660,01:15:53.900
"Because we're saying that if
we sum this up for k ending 100",01:15:53.900,01:15:57.820
"and k being 0 to 25,
and p being a half,",01:15:57.820,01:16:01.470
it's an incredibly tiny number.,01:16:01.470,01:16:04.600
So let's see why that is.,01:16:04.600,01:16:05.922
"And this phenomenon
is course going",01:16:05.922,01:16:07.380
"to be important in
computer science",01:16:07.380,01:16:09.690
"because it's going to enable
you to tell almost exactly how",01:16:09.690,01:16:12.290
"many components are going
to fail in a system,",01:16:12.290,01:16:15.120
if they're mutually independent.,01:16:15.120,01:16:16.617
"All right, now I'm not going
to drag you through the math.",01:16:30.624,01:16:33.040
"It's bad enough I'm going
to write it on the board.",01:16:33.040,01:16:36.760
"There's a bunch of
this in the text.",01:16:36.760,01:16:40.320
"And instead of k, I'm going to
represent by a parameter alpha",01:16:40.320,01:16:43.560
times n to be the integer k.,01:16:43.560,01:16:46.452
"All right, this will replace
k with a new parameter alpha.",01:16:46.452,01:16:50.330
"It's at most, and also it's
asymptotically equivalent",01:16:50.330,01:16:54.190
"using tilde-- both of those are
true-- to this nasty looking",01:16:54.190,01:16:58.390
"expression, 2 to the
alpha log p over alpha",01:16:58.390,01:17:08.900
"plus 1 minus alpha log 1 minus
p over 1 minus alpha times",01:17:08.900,01:17:18.740
"and n-- that's a big number,
it's 100-- over square root 2",01:17:18.740,01:17:26.000
pi alpha 1 minus alpha n.,01:17:26.000,01:17:31.840
"And this, of course,
alpha is between 0 and 1.",01:17:31.840,01:17:33.875
"Now when you do the
derivative on this thing,",01:17:37.790,01:17:39.970
"it turns out its maximum
value is when alpha equals p.",01:17:39.970,01:17:42.840
"And when you have alpha equals
p, you get log of 1 is 0,",01:17:51.320,01:17:57.580
log of 1 is 0.,01:17:57.580,01:17:58.640
"All this messy stuff goes
away and we just get that.",01:17:58.640,01:18:03.090
"And so in that case, fnp
of pn is at most, and also",01:18:03.090,01:18:10.520
"asymptotically equal to 1 over
square root 2 pi p 1 minus p n.",01:18:10.520,01:18:19.130
"And now you can plug in
values and compute things.",01:18:21.650,01:18:23.860
"For example, if
I flip 100 coins,",01:18:23.860,01:18:26.880
"and I want to know the
probability of getting 50--",01:18:26.880,01:18:29.720
"that means alpha's a
half, and they're fair,",01:18:29.720,01:18:32.240
"which means p is a
half, the answer is 8%.",01:18:32.240,01:18:38.080
"So n equals 100 coins,
p is a half, then",01:18:38.080,01:18:42.240
the probability of 50 heads.,01:18:42.240,01:18:44.730
"I just plug in p is a half here,
I get 1 over square root 50 pi,",01:18:49.370,01:18:55.840
which equals 0.080 and so forth.,01:18:55.840,01:19:00.670
"So there's an 8% chance of
getting exactly 50 heads.",01:19:00.670,01:19:05.905
"Now let's look at
the probability",01:19:05.905,01:19:07.280
of getting 25 or fewer.,01:19:07.280,01:19:10.670
"And we'll see why that
is so surprisingly small.",01:19:10.670,01:19:13.548
"OK, so for n equal
100 and p equal",01:19:30.170,01:19:38.160
"a half an alpha equal a quarter,
because we want 25 heads,",01:19:38.160,01:19:42.630
I'll get exactly 25 heads first.,01:19:42.630,01:19:46.110
"Probability of 25
heads is at most,",01:19:46.110,01:19:52.460
"well that square root thing
comes out to about 0.09.",01:19:52.460,01:19:57.900
Then I get 2 to something.,01:19:57.900,01:20:00.230
"I get 2 to the minus, all those
logs come out the 0.1887 times",01:20:00.230,01:20:09.380
"n, which is the
kicker, that's 100.",01:20:09.380,01:20:12.920
"So I get a 2 to the
minus 18th here.",01:20:12.920,01:20:16.730
"And that makes this
thing be smaller than",01:20:16.730,01:20:21.080
"or equal about to 1.913
times 10 to the minus 7.",01:20:21.080,01:20:26.230
So about 1 in 5 million.,01:20:26.230,01:20:29.960
"The reason this gets
so small is because you",01:20:29.960,01:20:32.760
"get the n in that
exponent up there.",01:20:32.760,01:20:35.872
"And of course, this
is all computed",01:20:35.872,01:20:37.330
"using Stirling's formula,
if you actually want",01:20:37.330,01:20:39.560
to go through the calculations.,01:20:39.560,01:20:41.370
"You go start with n choose
k, which is your n factorial,",01:20:41.370,01:20:46.190
"times over k factorial
n minus k factorial.",01:20:46.190,01:20:48.980
"Plug in Stirling's formula and
you do a bunch of messy stuff,",01:20:48.980,01:20:52.280
and these things pop out.,01:20:52.280,01:20:54.840
"And so it gets exponentially
small, exponentially fast.",01:20:54.840,01:20:57.720
"In fact, if you were
to plot this thing,",01:20:57.720,01:21:00.270
"if you plot the binomial
distribution function,",01:21:00.270,01:21:03.510
it looks something like this.,01:21:03.510,01:21:06.520
"All right, so I have
0 to n, and then I",01:21:17.330,01:21:21.380
"have pn, which is the maximum.",01:21:21.380,01:21:24.957
Here's the probability.,01:21:24.957,01:21:25.915
It goes 0 to 1.,01:21:25.915,01:21:28.560
"And your maximum value is here
at 8% in the case of 100 coins,",01:21:28.560,01:21:33.310
"and it just zooms down
exponential small.",01:21:33.310,01:21:39.980
"You can't even draw because
it gets so small so fast.",01:21:39.980,01:21:43.110
"This height here is
about 1 over root n.",01:21:43.110,01:21:50.840
"And this width here of
the hump, is about root n.",01:21:50.840,01:21:55.920
"And these things zoom down
to 0, exponentially fast.",01:21:55.920,01:22:01.470
"And so that's what the binomial
distribution looks like.",01:22:01.470,01:22:04.220
"And so it says that you are very
likely to be very close to pn",01:22:04.220,01:22:12.110
"heads, or pn things happening.",01:22:12.110,01:22:15.494
"And I won't go through the
math now-- probably do it",01:22:15.494,01:22:17.660
"in recitation
tomorrow-- of computing",01:22:17.660,01:22:20.300
"at most 25 heads, which is
the cumulative distribution",01:22:20.300,01:22:23.770
function.,01:22:23.770,01:22:25.222
"And this comes up in
all sorts of places.",01:22:25.222,01:22:26.930
"Like you have a noisy
communications channel,",01:22:26.930,01:22:29.920
"and every bit as
dropped with 1% chance.",01:22:29.920,01:22:33.620
"If you have 10,000
bits, you'd like",01:22:33.620,01:22:35.340
"to know, what's the
probability I lost 2% of them",01:22:35.340,01:22:40.000
when I have 1% failure rate?,01:22:40.000,01:22:42.990
"The chance of losing
2% out of 10,000",01:22:42.990,01:22:46.050
"is like 2 to the minus 60 if
they're mutually independent.",01:22:46.050,01:22:49.500
So no chance of losing 2%.,01:22:49.500,01:22:52.001
"All right, very good.",01:22:52.001,01:22:52.876
"We'll do more this in
recitation tomorrow.",01:22:52.876,01:22:55.730
