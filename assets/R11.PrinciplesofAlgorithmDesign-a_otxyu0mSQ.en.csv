my heart's back in place.",00:00:21.380,00:00:23.720

everyone's gone.",00:00:23.720,00:00:26.812
"AUDIENCE: Well you mean passed
out and died from the test?",00:00:26.812,00:00:29.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:00:29.480,00:00:30.250
"AUDIENCE: OK, no there
were a few students left.",00:00:30.250,00:00:32.380

good, that's good.",00:00:32.380,00:00:35.400
"I think once we release the
results everyone will calm",00:00:35.400,00:00:37.650
"down, and we'll realize that
the mistake was on our part.",00:00:37.650,00:00:41.498
AUDIENCE: The mistake?,00:00:41.498,00:00:42.710
"PROFESSOR: I mean the results
are lower than what we thought.",00:00:42.710,00:00:46.120
"And it's because we
haven't covered something",00:00:46.120,00:00:48.600
that I will cover today.,00:00:48.600,00:00:51.870
"So we think-- well we
talked about it yesterday,",00:00:51.870,00:00:54.346
"and we think we haven't
done enough algorithm",00:00:54.346,00:00:56.220
design with you guys.,00:00:56.220,00:00:57.094
"So today I have
problems, and we're",00:00:57.094,00:00:59.230
going to come up with solutions.,00:00:59.230,00:01:01.870
"AUDIENCE: Are you
not going to tell us",00:01:01.870,00:01:03.453
what [INAUDIBLE] number is?,00:01:03.453,00:01:05.519
"PROFESSOR: It's in
the lecture notes.",00:01:05.519,00:01:07.060
It's actually quite boring.,00:01:07.060,00:01:09.650
I promise it's really boring.,00:01:09.650,00:01:11.080
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:01:11.080,00:01:12.004
"PROFESSOR: And if you want
to do that next time when",00:01:12.004,00:01:14.170
"we'll actually talk
about numerics.",00:01:14.170,00:01:15.780
"The thing is numerics
are straightforward.",00:01:15.780,00:01:17.150
"Once you learn the
algorithms you're",00:01:17.150,00:01:18.649
"not going to come
up with a new one.",00:01:18.649,00:01:21.100
I'm pretty sure about that.,00:01:21.100,00:01:22.546
"Like you're not going to come
up with a revolutionary way",00:01:22.546,00:01:24.920
of adding two numbers.,00:01:24.920,00:01:26.980
AUDIENCE: I don't know.,00:01:26.980,00:01:29.420
You never know.,00:01:29.420,00:01:30.340
"PROFESSOR: Well you
can tell me why.",00:01:30.340,00:01:31.840
"Think about it and
then you can tell me",00:01:31.840,00:01:32.950
why you are not going to.,00:01:32.950,00:01:33.750
"AUDIENCE: OK, got it.",00:01:33.750,00:01:34.740
"PROFESSOR: OK so let's
start with a problem.",00:01:37.680,00:01:41.450
"We know what sorted
arrays look like, right?",00:01:41.450,00:01:43.450
"1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12.",00:01:46.130,00:01:50.890
This is a sorted array.,00:01:50.890,00:01:53.809
"If we're given a
sorted array we know",00:01:53.809,00:01:55.350
"how to find the
number in it, right?",00:01:55.350,00:01:59.210
"What's the running
time for that.",00:01:59.210,00:02:01.729
AUDIENCE: For any given number?,00:02:01.729,00:02:03.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:02:03.020,00:02:04.656
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:02:04.656,00:02:06.390
"PROFESSOR: Well what's
the best way that we know?",00:02:06.390,00:02:09.338
AUDIENCE: Logarithm.,00:02:09.338,00:02:10.230
"PROFESSOR: Log and
binary search, right?",00:02:10.230,00:02:11.896
"Well instead of this we're
given a shifted array.",00:02:14.580,00:02:18.040
"And shifted means
that-- say you're",00:02:18.040,00:02:20.880
"shifting the array
by K elements.",00:02:20.880,00:02:23.185
We're taking these guys.,00:02:23.185,00:02:25.090
"So the array is
shifted to the left.",00:02:25.090,00:02:27.890
"So these K elements
end up on the right.",00:02:27.890,00:02:30.930
"These N minus K elements
end up on the left.",00:02:30.930,00:02:34.760
"So 7, 9, 12, 1, 3, 5, 6.",00:02:34.760,00:02:39.000
"So still N elements they are
shifted by some number K.",00:02:42.780,00:02:48.130
"And I want to find one
number, e, in the array.",00:02:48.130,00:02:51.220
I don't know K by the way.,00:02:51.220,00:02:52.805
"We just know that
it's a shifted array.",00:02:52.805,00:02:54.430
This is 12.,00:02:58.120,00:02:58.930
"So the first thing
you do is figure out",00:03:06.490,00:03:12.430
"how much time you
have for this, right?",00:03:12.430,00:03:14.635
"If you're on a test, you
roughly know how much time",00:03:14.635,00:03:16.760
you have for a problem.,00:03:16.760,00:03:17.590
"If you're on an
interview you have",00:03:17.590,00:03:18.890
"to figure out how much
time the interviewer is",00:03:18.890,00:03:20.520
willing to give you for problem.,00:03:20.520,00:03:21.950
"And spend the first,
I don't, a third",00:03:21.950,00:03:24.960
of the time thinking maybe.,00:03:24.960,00:03:26.357
"Come up with the best
solution that you can.",00:03:26.357,00:03:28.190
"And then stop there,
and start talking.",00:03:28.190,00:03:30.800
"So the first thing
you do, you want",00:03:30.800,00:03:32.540
"to make sure that when
you run out of time",00:03:32.540,00:03:33.930
you have something to say.,00:03:33.930,00:03:35.013
"The most awful thing you can
say is, dude I'm going home now.",00:03:35.013,00:03:37.670
Or leave the answer blank.,00:03:37.670,00:03:39.422
"If you leave the
answer blank we're",00:03:39.422,00:03:40.880
"not going to give
you points, right?",00:03:40.880,00:03:42.570
So not good.,00:03:42.570,00:03:43.780
"So what's the worst
answer you could give us?",00:03:43.780,00:03:46.140
OK worst is a bad term.,00:03:50.260,00:03:54.460
"What's the brute force
solution to this?",00:03:54.460,00:03:56.630
"The solution where we don't
care about the running time,",00:03:56.630,00:03:58.970
but we want the correct answer.,00:03:58.970,00:04:02.100
AUDIENCE: Look everywhere.,00:04:02.100,00:04:03.350
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:04:03.350,00:04:04.710
So do a linear search.,00:04:04.710,00:04:06.600
"Pretend we don't know
anything about this array.",00:04:06.600,00:04:09.350
"Lose the information that
it's a shifted array.",00:04:09.350,00:04:11.420
"Linear search
running time order N.",00:04:11.420,00:04:16.860
"OK so this is
something, at least now",00:04:16.860,00:04:19.108
"when your time runs
out you have something.",00:04:19.108,00:04:20.899
"You're not going to
leave empty handed.",00:04:20.899,00:04:22.524
Let's start thinking now.,00:04:25.010,00:04:26.250
Next step.,00:04:26.250,00:04:26.770
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
can we shift it again?",00:04:30.011,00:04:32.764
"PROFESSOR: So the
fact that it's shifted",00:04:32.764,00:04:34.430
"means that-- so originally
it was sorted, right?",00:04:34.430,00:04:37.640
"But now instead of it
being completely sorted,",00:04:37.640,00:04:39.900
"you have all the elements
are shifted to the left.",00:04:39.900,00:04:42.580
"And then so there's a
rotation thing going on here.",00:04:42.580,00:04:45.610
"So these elements
got out of the array",00:04:45.610,00:04:48.430
"and then they are put back
in from the other side.",00:04:48.430,00:04:51.182
AUDIENCE: Why do we do that?,00:04:51.182,00:04:52.870
"PROFESSOR: That's how
the info looks like.",00:04:52.870,00:04:54.820
We don't do it.,00:04:54.820,00:04:55.910
It was done to us.,00:04:55.910,00:04:58.042
AUDIENCE: Oh OK.,00:04:58.042,00:04:58.932
So now what do we want?,00:04:58.932,00:04:59.890
"PROFESSOR: We want
to find an element--",00:04:59.890,00:05:00.980
"AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.",00:05:00.980,00:05:01.620
"PROFESSOR: --despite the fact
that the array looks like this.",00:05:01.620,00:05:04.161
"AUDIENCE: Do we know that
the list that we have",00:05:04.161,00:05:06.235
is shifted already?,00:05:06.235,00:05:07.240
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:05:07.240,00:05:07.910
"So we're promised that
this is a shifted array.",00:05:07.910,00:05:11.280
So it will look like this.,00:05:11.280,00:05:13.130
But we don't know what K is.,00:05:13.130,00:05:15.710
"If we knew what K is,
could we do something fast?",00:05:15.710,00:05:20.810
What would we do?,00:05:20.810,00:05:22.010
"AUDIENCE: Yeah, you'd
just re-shift [INAUDIBLE].",00:05:22.010,00:05:24.754
"PROFESSOR: OK so
if you re-shifted",00:05:24.754,00:05:26.170
what's the running time?,00:05:26.170,00:05:28.610
"AUDIENCE: For order
K [INAUDIBLE].",00:05:28.610,00:05:31.560
"PROFESSOR: OK so if
we actually shifted",00:05:31.560,00:05:33.225
"and then do a binary search
it's order K plus log",00:05:33.225,00:05:36.450
"N. So for big K's
that's not better.",00:05:36.450,00:05:40.692
"AUDIENCE: Why is it not
order N plus log [INAUDIBLE].",00:05:40.692,00:05:45.542
"PROFESSOR: You can say that
since we don't have any promise",00:05:45.542,00:05:48.000
"on K it's N. It's order K if
you can shift things out of both",00:05:48.000,00:05:53.620
N's.,00:05:53.620,00:05:54.410
"With Python this
would be order N,",00:05:54.410,00:05:55.970
"just popping out one element
is order N in Python.",00:05:55.970,00:05:58.610
"So this is assuming
a smart array.",00:05:58.610,00:06:01.430
"Otherwise if it's
Python, good point.",00:06:01.430,00:06:03.420
"It's straight up order N.
So now another good point.",00:06:03.420,00:06:07.920
"You have this solution, and you
have the brute force solution.",00:06:07.920,00:06:12.420
They have the same running time.,00:06:12.420,00:06:14.760
You run out of time.,00:06:14.760,00:06:16.110
"Which one are you
going to code up?",00:06:16.110,00:06:17.950
Which one are you going to show?,00:06:17.950,00:06:21.257
AUDIENCE: The simpler one.,00:06:21.257,00:06:22.340
"PROFESSOR: The simpler
one, excellent.",00:06:22.340,00:06:23.923
"So the reason is,
if you're on a test",00:06:23.923,00:06:26.230
"it's probably give the
pseudocode, then analyze it.",00:06:26.230,00:06:30.787
"If you're in an interview
the guy will ask you OK,",00:06:30.787,00:06:32.870
what's the running time?,00:06:32.870,00:06:34.290
"Code it up on the board in
C, Java, whatever he knows.",00:06:34.290,00:06:38.121
"So you want to code
the simplest solution,",00:06:38.121,00:06:39.870
"because that reduces the
chance that you'll have bugs.",00:06:39.870,00:06:42.170
"So that gives you
the most points.",00:06:42.170,00:06:44.290
"So this solution
shows more insight,",00:06:44.290,00:06:46.270
"but it doesn't have
a better run time.",00:06:46.270,00:06:49.490
Stick to the simple solution.,00:06:49.490,00:06:51.760
"However if you
have this then you",00:06:51.760,00:06:53.166
"have some insight
on the problem.",00:06:53.166,00:06:54.540
"So you can keep
going and hope you",00:06:54.540,00:06:57.300
"can come up with
a better answer.",00:06:57.300,00:06:59.480
"So if we knew K, one
thing we could do",00:06:59.480,00:07:02.090
"is reduce the array
to an unshifted array.",00:07:02.090,00:07:05.300
What's another thing we can do?,00:07:05.300,00:07:07.850
"So I claim that
if you know K you",00:07:07.850,00:07:10.080
"can come up with a
reasonably easy log N method.",00:07:10.080,00:07:16.196
"AUDIENCE: If you're
doing binary search,",00:07:16.196,00:07:18.370
"like if you just pretend like
the array is all together,",00:07:18.370,00:07:23.530
"but if you know K. So let's
say you're looking for 6.",00:07:23.530,00:07:28.013
"Then you'd say oh well I'm
going to split the array half,",00:07:28.013,00:07:32.340
"but you're actually
going to start at K",00:07:32.340,00:07:34.080
and then split it in half.,00:07:34.080,00:07:35.470
So it's like you pretend that--,00:07:35.470,00:07:38.300
"PROFESSOR: So what
you want to say",00:07:38.300,00:07:39.780
"is you have a pretend
array in your mind, right?",00:07:39.780,00:07:43.827
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:07:43.827,00:07:44.410
It's [INAUDIBLE] by K.,00:07:44.410,00:07:47.110
"PROFESSOR: And you want to
access the middle element",00:07:47.110,00:07:49.590
"to see if what you're looking
for is bigger or smaller.",00:07:49.590,00:07:53.030
"Instead of looking at
the middle element here,",00:07:53.030,00:07:55.100
"you look at the
middle plus K, right?",00:07:55.100,00:07:57.636
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:07:57.636,00:07:58.219
"Oh, there you go.",00:07:58.219,00:07:59.638
Plus K.,00:07:59.638,00:08:01.530
"PROFESSOR: This is one way of
doing it, good running time.",00:08:01.530,00:08:04.219
The problem is it's hard.,00:08:04.219,00:08:05.260
"You'll have to rewrite binary
search and hope it works.",00:08:05.260,00:08:08.490
"What I would do,
given that I've had",00:08:08.490,00:08:10.580
"a bit of time to think
about it, is this is sorted.",00:08:10.580,00:08:15.460
This is sorted.,00:08:15.460,00:08:17.790
"So two binary searched are
also going to be log N time.",00:08:17.790,00:08:22.630
"Two binary searches,
two lines of pseudocode.",00:08:22.630,00:08:25.270
"The running time analysis
is pretty simple.",00:08:25.270,00:08:27.540
"Correctness is
also pretty simple.",00:08:27.540,00:08:30.880
"And also this gives
me some insight",00:08:30.880,00:08:32.710
"on the rest of the
problem I claim.",00:08:32.710,00:08:34.689
"OK so if we have K we can do
log N. What if we don't have K?",00:08:37.470,00:08:43.780
What do we do?,00:08:43.780,00:08:45.830
Yes?,00:08:45.830,00:08:46.909
AUDIENCE: Figure out what K is.,00:08:46.909,00:08:48.200
"PROFESSOR: All right let's try
to find K. We know how to do it",00:08:48.200,00:08:50.783
"if we have K. So let's try
to find K. What-- if I want",00:08:50.783,00:08:55.360
"to arrive to a
solution that's log N,",00:08:55.360,00:09:00.020
"how much time can I
spend on finding K?",00:09:00.020,00:09:01.830
"OK so let's find
K in log N time.",00:09:04.340,00:09:07.260
"AUDIENCE: Binary
search for minimum?",00:09:11.220,00:09:13.210
"PROFESSOR: Binary search--
so I like binary search,",00:09:13.210,00:09:15.720
"because binary search
is an algorithm that",00:09:15.720,00:09:17.780
runs on an array.,00:09:17.780,00:09:19.590
And that runs in log N time.,00:09:19.590,00:09:21.300
"So if I'm able to make it
work I know everything's",00:09:21.300,00:09:24.092
"going to be right
in terms of time.",00:09:24.092,00:09:25.550
"So what do you run
a binary search for?",00:09:25.550,00:09:28.335
"AUDIENCE: The smallest
number possible?",00:09:28.335,00:09:29.960
"I guess that's kind of going
through all of them, though.",00:09:29.960,00:09:32.335
It doesn't really help.,00:09:32.335,00:09:33.400
"PROFESSOR: So if
you have the min.",00:09:33.400,00:09:35.280
"Sorry, you can
speak in one second.",00:09:35.280,00:09:36.902
AUDIENCE: Oh we have the min!,00:09:36.902,00:09:38.110
"PROFESSOR: So no, if
you can't have the min.",00:09:38.110,00:09:39.943
I think it's good insight.,00:09:39.943,00:09:41.080
"So if you knew where the min
is, you know this is K, right?",00:09:41.080,00:09:45.134
AUDIENCE: Yes.,00:09:45.134,00:09:45.970
"PROFESSOR: So this
is the minimum,",00:09:45.970,00:09:47.900
"that's K. OK, what
were you going to say?",00:09:47.900,00:09:51.105
"AUDIENCE: Oh for
just binary search",00:09:51.105,00:09:52.653
"it would not
[INAUDIBLE] minimum.",00:09:52.653,00:09:55.491
"I was thinking that if we start
at 1 we will see to our right",00:09:55.491,00:10:01.900
and left.,00:10:01.900,00:10:02.900
"And the point where
[INAUDIBLE] are ending",00:10:02.900,00:10:05.304
"is where we have something
larger to our right",00:10:05.304,00:10:08.004
"and something
smaller to our left.",00:10:08.004,00:10:09.420
"PROFESSOR: OK so there's
a discontinuity here,",00:10:09.420,00:10:11.420
"that's what you're
saying, right?",00:10:11.420,00:10:12.180
So this is sorted.,00:10:12.180,00:10:13.180
"But then at this
point this breaks.",00:10:13.180,00:10:15.390
"AUDIENCE: Yes, we are kind
of finding that point where",00:10:15.390,00:10:18.700
"something to the
right that's greater",00:10:18.700,00:10:20.650
"than [INAUDIBLE] and
something to the left",00:10:20.650,00:10:22.682
"is also greater
than [INAUDIBLE].",00:10:22.682,00:10:24.225
"PROFESSOR: OK so let's
see if we can do that.",00:10:24.225,00:10:26.100
"So for binary search you
have to go somewhere.",00:10:26.100,00:10:29.030
"So in our case we're
trying to get K, right?",00:10:29.030,00:10:32.890
"And we know that it's
somewhere between 1 and 10.",00:10:32.890,00:10:36.200
"And what binary search
does is it makes a guess.",00:10:36.200,00:10:38.515
"It says hey, I think it's
in the middle of the array.",00:10:42.970,00:10:45.820
"So it will probably
guess n over 2.",00:10:45.820,00:10:49.380
"And it makes a
guess and you have",00:10:49.380,00:10:52.030
"to tell it was the
guess too small,",00:10:52.030,00:10:54.290
or was the guess too large?,00:10:54.290,00:10:57.310
"Because this is what
allows you to recurse",00:10:57.310,00:10:59.220
"on either the left interval
or on the right interval.",00:10:59.220,00:11:02.930
"The problem with a discontinuity
is, if I guess here,",00:11:02.930,00:11:07.100
"and if I guess here, I still
don't see the discontinuity.",00:11:07.100,00:11:10.850
"So it's good inside,
but it's not enough.",00:11:10.850,00:11:12.860
I need a little bit more.,00:11:12.860,00:11:14.540
"Yes, 2, 3 hands oh wow
you guys don't got it?",00:11:14.540,00:11:18.531
"AUDIENCE: So I think
we can arbitrarily",00:11:18.531,00:11:20.155
"take the halfway point
instead of subtracting",00:11:20.155,00:11:22.497
from the first element.,00:11:22.497,00:11:23.455
"And then if it's
a negative number,",00:11:23.455,00:11:27.085
"then discontinuity
will be in this half.",00:11:27.085,00:11:30.055
"If it's [INAUDIBLE] it
will be in the other half.",00:11:30.055,00:11:32.107
And then you recurse on that.,00:11:32.107,00:11:33.315
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:11:33.315,00:11:34.920
So let's draw this up.,00:11:34.920,00:11:37.950
"So in a sorted array the
numbers look like this.",00:11:37.950,00:11:43.740
"In a shifted array
we splice it here,",00:11:43.740,00:11:47.170
and this guy goes to the right.,00:11:47.170,00:11:49.530
"So it's like this
and then like this.",00:11:49.530,00:11:57.220
"So this picture shows me the
insight that I had before,",00:11:57.220,00:11:59.750
"that this part is sorted
and this part is sorted.",00:11:59.750,00:12:03.320
"The missing part,
which I just heard now,",00:12:03.320,00:12:05.110
"is that since the whole
array was originally sorted,",00:12:05.110,00:12:09.880
"this guy is smaller
than this guy.",00:12:09.880,00:12:13.020
"So if I draw a
horizontal line here,",00:12:13.020,00:12:19.160
"I can draw a horizontal
line somewhere,",00:12:19.160,00:12:21.150
"and this and this
will not cross it.",00:12:21.150,00:12:24.990
"So this whole thing
is taller than this.",00:12:24.990,00:12:29.670
"So by the way, K was where
the discontinuity was, right?",00:12:29.670,00:12:33.130
You said discontinuity.,00:12:33.130,00:12:34.580
"This is K, it's somewhere here.",00:12:34.580,00:12:38.450
So this is a better.,00:12:38.450,00:12:39.540
"So if I make my guess and
I land somewhere here,",00:12:39.540,00:12:44.330
"I can know that my
guess is too big,",00:12:44.330,00:12:46.150
because it's below the line.,00:12:46.150,00:12:48.450
"If I make my guess and
it's somewhere here,",00:12:48.450,00:12:51.830
"I know my guess is too small,
because the number that I",00:12:51.830,00:12:54.410
see here is above the line.,00:12:54.410,00:12:56.530
Who sets the line?,00:12:56.530,00:12:57.820
The first element here.,00:12:57.820,00:12:58.950
"So this is how you
look at it graphically.",00:13:02.010,00:13:04.030
"If you don't want to
look at it graphically,",00:13:04.030,00:13:06.410
this was a sorted array.,00:13:06.410,00:13:08.820
"If this is the Kth
element, then everything",00:13:08.820,00:13:12.960
here is smaller than it.,00:13:12.960,00:13:14.950
"So all these guys are smaller
than the first element.",00:13:14.950,00:13:18.470
"OK so honestly who
understands the solution?",00:13:24.180,00:13:26.780
"3, 4, OK.",00:13:29.360,00:13:31.432
"Oh, OK pretty good.",00:13:31.432,00:13:34.230
"Do we want to code
this up, or do we",00:13:34.230,00:13:36.380
want to look at another problem?,00:13:36.380,00:13:39.019
"OK who wants to look
at another problem?",00:13:39.019,00:13:40.685
"Clear majority, all right.",00:13:43.900,00:13:45.560
"Usually I have to
do both choices,",00:13:45.560,00:13:46.980
"because not enough people are
paying attention to get this.",00:13:46.980,00:13:49.780
So I am happy.,00:13:49.780,00:13:51.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:13:51.560,00:13:53.515
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:13:53.515,00:13:54.140
"All right so before I start
another problem, one thing",00:13:59.870,00:14:02.120
I want to say.,00:14:02.120,00:14:03.130
"Not only do I have a
solution for this problem,",00:14:03.130,00:14:05.186
"but I have a
process that allowed",00:14:05.186,00:14:06.560
"me to go from nothing to
a few partial solutions.",00:14:06.560,00:14:11.040
"And while I was doing
that, I was getting insight",00:14:11.040,00:14:13.230
"and I was making sure that if
I run out of time before I have",00:14:13.230,00:14:16.300
"the final solution, I don't walk
out of the room empty handed.",00:14:16.300,00:14:20.670
"So I don't just want to
show you the final solution,",00:14:20.670,00:14:23.000
I want to show you the process.,00:14:23.000,00:14:24.630
"You can look at the notes
and see the final solution.",00:14:24.630,00:14:26.838
"That's not everything I
want you to get out of this.",00:14:26.838,00:14:30.860
"OK, problem 2 has a heap.",00:14:30.860,00:14:33.900
"And this is a minimum heap,
so it looks like this.",00:14:38.960,00:14:41.420
"So this is a minimum
heap, N elements.",00:14:51.360,00:14:55.520
"And I want to extract the kth
smallest element in the heap.",00:14:55.520,00:14:59.440
"So if K equals 3, this is the
third smallest element, right?",00:15:03.330,00:15:07.450
"K equals 4, it's this guy.",00:15:07.450,00:15:09.240
"5, and 6, 1 and 2 are here.",00:15:09.240,00:15:12.130
"OK the good running
time that we want,",00:15:14.740,00:15:18.756
"because this is a hard
problem so we give you",00:15:18.756,00:15:20.630
"the running time,
is K log K. However",00:15:20.630,00:15:25.300
"before we do that I want to
hear some brute force solutions.",00:15:25.300,00:15:29.942
AUDIENCE: All of them.,00:15:29.942,00:15:31.555
PROFESSOR: And?,00:15:31.555,00:15:32.180
OK you need to sort them first.,00:15:35.110,00:15:37.170
"So this heap is actually
an array, right?",00:15:37.170,00:15:41.600
"2, 5, 7, 6, 8, oh
it's 6, 9, 8, sorry.",00:15:41.600,00:15:49.840
"So you're saying sort
the array, then K--",00:15:49.840,00:15:53.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:15:53.200,00:15:54.640
"PROFESSOR: OK what's the
running time for this?",00:15:54.640,00:15:57.004
AUDIENCE: Log N.,00:15:57.004,00:16:04.090
"PROFESSOR: All right
we have a solution.",00:16:04.090,00:16:05.910
"We're not going to
leave empty handed.",00:16:05.910,00:16:09.180
OK let's try to go a bit better.,00:16:09.180,00:16:12.857
"What's another way
of going it that'll",00:16:12.857,00:16:14.440
give me a better running time?,00:16:14.440,00:16:18.190
"AUDIENCE: You could pop 5 of
the K elements off of the--",00:16:18.190,00:16:20.815
"PROFESSOR: All right so
this is a mean heap, right?",00:16:20.815,00:16:22.940
So it has find min.,00:16:22.940,00:16:24.281
"And find min runs in order
log N. So if I call it K times",00:16:26.990,00:16:33.950
"I'm going to get the
K smallest elements.",00:16:33.950,00:16:36.910
"By the way heap sort
says pop and times,",00:16:36.910,00:16:39.610
"and you'll have all the
elements in sorted order.",00:16:39.610,00:16:42.190
"So we're doing a
heap sort, except we",00:16:42.190,00:16:43.970
"stop when we lose
interest after K elements.",00:16:43.970,00:16:47.710
"So we're down from
N log N to K log N.",00:16:47.710,00:16:54.700
"So I would be interested in
hearing a solution that's",00:16:54.700,00:16:58.600
"worse, because it would
look like N log K.",00:16:58.600,00:17:03.890
But shows me more insight.,00:17:03.890,00:17:06.826
So by the way this is good.,00:17:06.826,00:17:07.950
"You're already K log N. So
K log N, the correct answer",00:17:07.950,00:17:12.190
"is K log K. Small
difference, right?",00:17:12.190,00:17:16.569
It's a logarithm factor.,00:17:16.569,00:17:18.280
At least it's not an N factor.,00:17:18.280,00:17:19.930
"If you code this up
chances are we're",00:17:19.930,00:17:21.499
"not going to be able to
distinguish between this.",00:17:21.499,00:17:23.540
"So you'll never
see this on a PSet.",00:17:23.540,00:17:24.998
So you're almost there.,00:17:24.998,00:17:28.150
"And this is just applying
straight up knowledge",00:17:28.150,00:17:30.790
that we had before.,00:17:30.790,00:17:32.830
"Let's look at this
solution, if anyone sees it.",00:17:32.830,00:17:36.210
Before we attempt K log K.,00:17:38.800,00:17:41.640
"AUDIENCE: In another
case would we",00:17:41.640,00:17:43.490
"just pop off first K elements,
why would that be in log N?",00:17:43.490,00:17:48.070
"Because it's actually
an array, so I",00:17:48.070,00:17:51.620
"would think that we'd
just take the K time.",00:17:51.620,00:17:54.980
PROFESSOR: So this is a heap.,00:17:54.980,00:17:56.650
"If you don't maintain
the heaping variant",00:17:56.650,00:17:58.516
"after you do the
first pop you're",00:17:58.516,00:17:59.890
"not going to be able
to do the second one.",00:17:59.890,00:18:02.570
"OK, cool.",00:18:02.570,00:18:05.970
So let me give you a hint.,00:18:05.970,00:18:07.480
"How would we find--
if this is an array--",00:18:07.480,00:18:10.260
how do I find the minimum?,00:18:10.260,00:18:12.280
"2, 5, 7, did I forget something?",00:18:12.280,00:18:14.680
No.,00:18:14.680,00:18:16.180
"Let's pretend this array doesn't
start with 2, because it's",00:18:16.180,00:18:19.280
boring if it starts with 2.,00:18:19.280,00:18:21.530
How do I find the minimum?,00:18:21.530,00:18:23.140
"I keep one variable that says
the best I've seen so far,",00:18:23.140,00:18:26.300
right?,00:18:26.300,00:18:27.250
"Let's see, N-- oh
this is still boring.",00:18:27.250,00:18:31.570
Let's start here.,00:18:31.570,00:18:32.960
"So we start with
best seen equals 7.",00:18:32.960,00:18:38.120
"Then when we go to 6 we see,
is 6 better than best seen?",00:18:38.120,00:18:41.970
"If so, replace best seen with 6.",00:18:41.970,00:18:45.500
If not keep going.,00:18:45.500,00:18:46.940
Then I get to 9.,00:18:46.940,00:18:47.950
Is 9 better than best seen?,00:18:47.950,00:18:50.400
"Nope, keep going.",00:18:50.400,00:18:51.430
Is 8 better than best seen?,00:18:51.430,00:18:52.820
"Nope, keep going.",00:18:52.820,00:18:54.200
"So I compare every element
with the best seen,",00:18:54.200,00:18:59.210
"and then whenever the element
is better I do a replacement.",00:18:59.210,00:19:02.950
"And then at the end, best seen
will have the smallest element.",00:19:02.950,00:19:06.060
"So this algorithm
works for k equals",00:19:06.060,00:19:08.130
"1, which isn't very useful.",00:19:08.130,00:19:11.510
"So can we generalize
this somehow",00:19:11.510,00:19:14.130
"to-- so we have a
running time here.",00:19:14.130,00:19:17.557
"That might give you a hint about

"and I want to generalize
it for all values of K.",00:19:20.140,00:19:28.749
"AUDIENCE: If you go to the
power of 2 then it's less than--",00:19:28.749,00:19:33.334
"the nearest power
of 2 less than K--",00:19:33.334,00:19:35.070

"AUDIENCE: --that element, and
iterate forward with your best",00:19:35.985,00:19:42.010
seen.,00:19:42.010,00:19:42.510
Does that make sense?,00:19:42.510,00:19:44.470
"If you want the kth, if you
want the tenth smallest element,",00:19:44.470,00:19:48.610
"then it has to be
after the 8th row",00:19:48.610,00:19:55.040
"because it's the next
level in the tree.",00:19:55.040,00:19:57.690
Does that make sense?,00:19:57.690,00:19:58.565
That doesn't make sense.,00:19:58.565,00:20:00.020
"PROFESSOR: It makes sense,
but I don't think it's right.",00:20:00.020,00:20:03.417
"So you're thinking that
the tenth smallest element",00:20:03.417,00:20:05.500
"has to be somewhere
below, right?",00:20:05.500,00:20:07.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:20:07.220,00:20:07.845
"PROFESSOR: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, and then pretend",00:20:10.270,00:20:20.630
that there are numbers here.,00:20:20.630,00:20:22.570
"11, 12, 13, 14, 15, do
you see what I'm saying?",00:20:22.570,00:20:27.480
So this is a heap.,00:20:27.480,00:20:28.340
"So I can keep filling
it with bigger elements,",00:20:34.420,00:20:37.640
and 10 is here.,00:20:37.640,00:20:40.490
"However you can
do something else",00:20:40.490,00:20:43.910
to limit the size of the heap.,00:20:43.910,00:20:48.350
"It will give us a
different running time,",00:20:48.350,00:20:50.640
but you can do something.,00:20:50.640,00:20:52.280
You can think about it.,00:20:52.280,00:20:53.660
"How can you chop up
some of the heap?",00:20:53.660,00:20:56.490
"For example if I have
a heap that's ten deep",00:20:56.490,00:20:58.450
"and I look at the fourth
element, what can I do?",00:20:58.450,00:21:03.250
You can think about that.,00:21:03.250,00:21:04.840
And let's try to get to this.,00:21:04.840,00:21:08.262
"So I'll accept an
answer for either",00:21:08.262,00:21:09.720
"how do we limit the
heap in that case,",00:21:09.720,00:21:12.010
"or how do we generalize
this algorithm.",00:21:12.010,00:21:15.270
Yes?,00:21:15.270,00:21:16.580
"AUDIENCE: You want us to
remember the smallest K",00:21:16.580,00:21:18.870
"elements, you'd make a max
heap [INAUDIBLE] K [INAUDIBLE]",00:21:18.870,00:21:23.406
[INAUDIBLE].,00:21:23.406,00:21:25.310
"PROFESSOR: OK so
I want to have--",00:21:25.310,00:21:27.060
"I'll break down your
solution into parts .",00:21:27.060,00:21:30.050
"So you want to have a bag of
the smallest K elements, right?",00:21:30.050,00:21:35.090
"So instead of the best seen, you
want to have the K best seen.",00:21:35.090,00:21:40.960
"And once you have a bag you want
to go through your elements.",00:21:40.960,00:21:44.930
"And then if you have
something that's",00:21:44.930,00:21:46.920
"better than what
you have in the bag,",00:21:46.920,00:21:48.817
you want to put that in the bag.,00:21:48.817,00:21:50.150
"Suppose I have,
suppose K equals 3,",00:21:52.710,00:21:55.100
"and I have 2, 5,
and 7 in the bag.",00:21:55.100,00:21:59.310
And I see 6.,00:21:59.310,00:22:00.820
"Who do I want to
compare it with?",00:22:00.820,00:22:03.120
"The biggest thing
in the bag, right?",00:22:03.120,00:22:05.700
"So if I want the K
smallest elements,",00:22:05.700,00:22:09.790
"if this guy is
smaller than anything,",00:22:09.790,00:22:11.830
"these aren't the K
smallest elements anymore.",00:22:11.830,00:22:14.830
"So I want to take the
maximum in the bag,",00:22:14.830,00:22:17.500
"compare it with what
I'm seeing right now,",00:22:17.500,00:22:20.160
"and if what I'm seeing is
smaller I want to replace it.",00:22:20.160,00:22:23.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:22:29.704,00:22:30.620
"PROFESSOR: Because I
keep doing this maximum,",00:22:30.620,00:22:32.700
"I keep asking this
maximum question,",00:22:32.700,00:22:34.400
this has to be a max heap.,00:22:34.400,00:22:35.490
That's why he said max heap.,00:22:35.490,00:22:36.882
"So you did all
these steps at once",00:22:41.610,00:22:43.900
"and then gave me
the final answer.",00:22:43.900,00:22:45.450
"But this is how you
do it step by step.",00:22:45.450,00:22:47.230
"So it looks like finding
the minimum element,",00:22:47.230,00:22:52.810
except you have a bag.,00:22:52.810,00:22:54.450
"And that bag has to
be a maximum heap.",00:22:54.450,00:22:56.590
"And the original heap
is a minimum heap.",00:22:56.590,00:22:58.380
"So the fact that you have
to use a maximum heap",00:22:58.380,00:23:00.338
is a bit nontrivial.,00:23:00.338,00:23:01.960
Good answer.,00:23:01.960,00:23:03.020
"All right so we
have K log N, and we",00:23:03.020,00:23:06.100
"have N log K, so choose what
you want to have in your log.",00:23:06.100,00:23:10.270
We have a solution for you.,00:23:10.270,00:23:11.410
How about this.,00:23:14.530,00:23:15.680
How are we doing here?,00:23:15.680,00:23:16.770
"So suppose I'm looking
for the fourth element,",00:23:20.480,00:23:22.690
and my heap has 10 levels.,00:23:22.690,00:23:25.120
"How can I chop it--
how can I reduce",00:23:25.120,00:23:28.050
"the number of things
I'm looking at?",00:23:28.050,00:23:29.650
"AUDIENCE: You can reduce
it down to 4 levels.",00:23:37.330,00:23:40.230
"PROFESSOR: I can reduce it
down to 4 levels, exactly.",00:23:40.230,00:23:43.550
So this heap has log N levels.,00:23:43.550,00:23:48.640
"And my K is smaller than log
N. I can reduce the heap down",00:23:48.640,00:23:52.490
"to K levels and discard
everything below.",00:23:52.490,00:23:55.700
"And the reason for that is
we have a mean heap, right?",00:23:59.150,00:24:03.310
"So if we go down from, on any
path from the roots to a leaf,",00:24:03.310,00:24:07.690
"the values have to
increase, right?",00:24:07.690,00:24:11.150
Otherwise it's not a mean keep.,00:24:11.150,00:24:12.520
"Otherwise there's an invariant
violation somewhere there.",00:24:12.520,00:24:15.290
"So as I go down on any path
my numbers are going up.",00:24:15.290,00:24:21.650
"So these are all the
paths of length 4.",00:24:21.650,00:24:26.615
"All of them have
to go through here.",00:24:26.615,00:24:29.370
"All the paths of length
4 will stop here.",00:24:29.370,00:24:32.320
"So I know that
everything here has",00:24:32.320,00:24:34.450
"to be bigger than
the first 4 elements.",00:24:34.450,00:24:37.210
"So if I reduce this to K and
I discard everything else,",00:24:37.210,00:24:41.330
what's the running time?,00:24:41.330,00:24:44.630
"So if I use my find my
extract min algorithm before,",00:24:44.630,00:24:47.150
what was the running time?,00:24:47.150,00:24:49.389
AUDIENCE: It was [INAUDIBLE].,00:24:49.389,00:24:51.361
PROFESSOR: So it's not the--,00:24:56.790,00:24:58.300
AUDIENCE: Oh sorry it's the--,00:24:58.300,00:25:01.085
"PROFESSOR: So what's
one operation in a heap?",00:25:01.085,00:25:02.960
"If I have the height of a
heap, what's an operation?",00:25:02.960,00:25:06.420
"How much time does it
take to do one operation",00:25:06.420,00:25:08.604
"as a function of the
height of the heap?",00:25:08.604,00:25:10.270
"So if my heap has h
levels, in this case",00:25:13.940,00:25:17.010
"h happens to be log
N, it's order h.",00:25:17.010,00:25:20.840
"So if I reduce it-- I'm not
reducing it from N to K.",00:25:20.840,00:25:24.090
I wish I could.,00:25:24.090,00:25:24.950
I'm reducing it from log N to K.,00:25:24.950,00:25:26.800
"So for really tiny K's,
this becomes order K.",00:25:26.800,00:25:30.670
"And my total running
time is K squared.",00:25:30.670,00:25:38.410
"So I'm going to do K
operations, K extract mins.",00:25:38.410,00:25:42.230
"OK now the reason I wanted
to entertain this is I",00:25:42.230,00:25:45.730
"claim it's going to be useful
to help us find the answer.",00:25:45.730,00:25:48.970
"So everything that we have
here gives us some insight",00:25:48.970,00:25:52.630
into what the correct answer is.,00:25:52.630,00:25:56.350
Well what our correct answer is.,00:25:56.350,00:25:57.900
There might be others.,00:25:57.900,00:26:01.040
"So let's think for a bit,
and see if we can do better.",00:26:01.040,00:26:04.350
Am I covering something?,00:26:13.220,00:26:14.678
I hope not.,00:26:14.678,00:26:15.674
"So by the way, when you
have problems on your own,",00:26:27.321,00:26:29.404
"say you are looking at
CLRS or at old exams,",00:26:29.404,00:26:31.470
"you want to give yourselves
half an hour, an hour to think.",00:26:31.470,00:26:35.270
"And just this process
alone is going",00:26:35.270,00:26:37.027
to help you do better on a test.,00:26:37.027,00:26:38.360
"Because while you're thinking
you're going through everything",00:26:38.360,00:26:40.290
you know.,00:26:40.290,00:26:40.850
"And you're rearranging
stuff in your brain",00:26:40.850,00:26:43.050
"in a way that will be
easier to access it later.",00:26:43.050,00:26:45.336

what do I know about heaps?",00:26:45.336,00:26:47.710
"What do I know that
takes log N time?",00:26:47.710,00:26:50.640
"What do I know that
takes N log N time?",00:26:50.640,00:26:52.380

be better at answering",00:26:52.380,00:26:55.340
these kinds of questions later.,00:26:55.340,00:26:57.129
"Now we're not going to
give you 30 minutes,",00:26:57.129,00:26:58.920

us run out of time.",00:26:58.920,00:27:01.860
"AUDIENCE: You want to reduce
it down to K elements.",00:27:05.129,00:27:08.047

to only have to look",00:27:08.047,00:27:09.630
"at K elements, that's good.",00:27:09.630,00:27:11.650

can't plug K into the search.",00:27:11.650,00:27:14.160
"PROFESSOR: Yep,
OK so that's good.",00:27:14.160,00:27:16.640
"AUDIENCE: Which is interesting,
because it's K log K,",00:27:16.640,00:27:19.630
"and that kind of
suggests that you'd",00:27:19.630,00:27:21.130
have K elements in the tree.,00:27:21.130,00:27:23.420

for each one in the tree.",00:27:23.420,00:27:27.860

maybe I'm not going",00:27:27.860,00:27:29.440
"to be able to cut this heap
into K elements, right?",00:27:29.440,00:27:32.430

see how this keep",00:27:50.080,00:27:52.090
would look like if it's cut.,00:27:52.090,00:27:53.940

second element in a heap,",00:28:13.090,00:28:16.000

I have to look at?",00:28:16.000,00:28:18.220
"Two, 5 and 7, because everything
below will be bigger, right?",00:28:18.220,00:28:22.940
"OK I look at them,
I compare them,",00:28:22.940,00:28:26.180
I know 5 is the smallest one.,00:28:26.180,00:28:29.230

find the third element.",00:28:29.230,00:28:31.990

7 or the thing under 5.,00:28:39.120,00:28:40.640
"So 7 is still in
the race for sure.",00:28:40.640,00:28:42.630
"And then I have to look
at the children of 5.",00:28:42.630,00:28:47.420

pseudocode into it.",00:30:24.580,00:30:27.300
So does the concept make sense?,00:30:27.300,00:30:31.595
AUDIENCE: Is that K log K?,00:30:31.595,00:30:33.455
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:30:33.455,00:30:34.080
"So the idea here is that I
have a horizon that says,",00:30:37.560,00:30:40.960
"what are the next elements
that I'm willing to consider?",00:30:40.960,00:30:44.320
"And first the horizon
starts with just the root,",00:30:44.320,00:30:46.730
"because I know that's
the minimum element.",00:30:46.730,00:30:48.920
"And when I take an
element out of the horizon",00:30:48.920,00:30:50.890
I put in its children.,00:30:50.890,00:30:52.970
That's what I did all the time.,00:30:52.970,00:30:56.160
"So given a horizon how do I
know what the next elements",00:30:56.160,00:30:59.160
to extract out of the horizon?,00:30:59.160,00:31:01.536
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:31:01.536,00:31:03.000
"PROFESSOR: The mean, OK.",00:31:03.000,00:31:04.720
"So I want a data
structure for the horizon",00:31:04.720,00:31:06.620
that can extract means quickly.,00:31:06.620,00:31:09.490
"OK what am I going to
use for the horizon?",00:31:09.490,00:31:13.030
"A min heap, excellent.",00:31:13.030,00:31:15.490
"So let's try to
go for pseudocode.",00:31:15.490,00:31:17.405
"Suppose we have H as
our original heap.",00:31:26.030,00:31:30.694
So H is a mean heap.,00:31:30.694,00:31:31.527
We will make Z be our horizon.,00:31:34.150,00:31:36.300
I can't use H again.,00:31:36.300,00:31:37.279
"It would be nice if
I could, but I'll",00:31:37.279,00:31:38.820
"use Z because Z's also
a letter in horizon.",00:31:38.820,00:31:41.610
So Z's the mean heap.,00:31:41.610,00:31:44.910
"And then first I
will insert into Z.",00:31:44.910,00:31:48.700
"I'll insert the
heap's root, right?",00:31:48.700,00:31:51.620
So Z dot insert H of 1.,00:31:51.620,00:31:55.910
"Remember that heaps
are actually arrays.",00:31:55.910,00:31:58.220
I hinted to his earlier.,00:31:58.220,00:31:59.220
"So these nodes have are
elements in an array.",00:31:59.220,00:32:04.740
"So this is the first element,
second, third, fourth, fifth,",00:32:04.740,00:32:09.550
sixth.,00:32:09.550,00:32:11.970
"So we're using array
backed heaps, and H of one",00:32:11.970,00:32:15.130
is going to be the root.,00:32:15.130,00:32:16.670
"Then I'm going to compute the
first K elements like this,",00:32:16.670,00:32:21.120
"for K in range-- sorry,
for i in range K,",00:32:21.120,00:32:29.380
so K is going to go from 1 to K.,00:32:29.380,00:32:33.480
What I want to do?,00:32:33.480,00:32:34.280
"Take, compute the ith element.",00:32:38.590,00:32:41.420
How do I do that?,00:32:41.420,00:32:43.508
AUDIENCE: Extract min.,00:32:43.508,00:32:46.190
"PROFESSOR: i equals
Z dot extract min.",00:32:46.190,00:32:48.346
"And then I want to insert
the children in the horizon.",00:32:57.010,00:32:59.335
Right?,00:33:02.170,00:33:04.290
How do I do that?,00:33:04.290,00:33:05.075
AUDIENCE: 2i and 2i plus 1.,00:33:08.664,00:33:11.030
"PROFESSOR: OK so this is
if I know the index, right?",00:33:11.030,00:33:16.110
"When I'm putting
things in the heap",00:33:19.450,00:33:21.880
"the keys are going
to be the values,",00:33:21.880,00:33:23.520
"so that I can take
out the minimum.",00:33:23.520,00:33:25.936
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] heap
first and then inserted H Y.",00:33:25.936,00:33:30.460
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.",00:33:30.460,00:33:33.370
This is empty.,00:33:33.370,00:33:36.800
And this is the input.,00:33:36.800,00:33:38.000
"OK so I need to use the
numbers as the keys.",00:33:45.560,00:33:49.050
"So when I extract
something out of the heap,",00:33:49.050,00:33:51.440
"so when I extract the first
element it's going to say 2,",00:33:51.440,00:33:53.870
it's not going to say 1.,00:33:53.870,00:33:56.770
If I want to--,00:33:56.770,00:33:58.137
"AUDIENCE: Why wouldn't Z dot
extract [INAUDIBLE] because--",00:33:58.137,00:34:02.790
"PROFESSOR: So this will give
me the next key in the horizon.",00:34:02.790,00:34:07.600
"AUDIENCE: But-- oh I
see, you're starting out",00:34:07.600,00:34:11.550
with just the first one.,00:34:11.550,00:34:13.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:34:13.150,00:34:14.439
"AUDIENCE: Oh and then you
want to add in the next.",00:34:14.439,00:34:15.409
"PROFESSOR: So at the
end of this whole thing,",00:34:15.409,00:34:17.283
"if I'm extracting them right, I
can return this variable here.",00:34:17.283,00:34:25.639
"Because after K durations this
is going to be the Kth element.",00:34:25.639,00:34:29.190
So I return it and I'm done.,00:34:29.190,00:34:31.250
"The problem is I want this
guy's index too, right?",00:34:31.250,00:34:37.520
"So I can't just store
the key in the heap.",00:34:37.520,00:34:40.739
"I have to augment the heap
to let me store values.",00:34:40.739,00:34:43.020
And I have to store the index.,00:34:43.020,00:34:45.340
"So for this guy would
have Z insert H of 1,",00:34:45.340,00:34:49.090
and then it's index 1.,00:34:49.090,00:34:51.530
"Then when I get
out the ith element",00:34:51.530,00:34:56.300
I'll also get out it's index.,00:34:56.300,00:34:58.040
A variable name for that?,00:34:58.040,00:35:00.144
AUDIENCE: j.,00:35:00.144,00:35:01.130
PROFESSOR: j.,00:35:01.130,00:35:02.930
"OK why would you name
your variables like this?",00:35:02.930,00:35:07.770
"In the previous section I had
a similar suggestion, i, i.",00:35:07.770,00:35:10.640
"So why would you name
your variables like this?",00:35:10.640,00:35:14.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:35:14.680,00:35:16.530
PROFESSOR: Job security.,00:35:16.530,00:35:17.530
All right.,00:35:20.750,00:35:21.930
So it's OK here.,00:35:21.930,00:35:23.540
"Try to not to do that when
doing an exam or an interview,",00:35:23.540,00:35:26.580
"because it reflects
poorly on you.",00:35:26.580,00:35:28.184
"For an interview and for
an exam you'll get us upset",00:35:28.184,00:35:30.350
and we might be less lenient.,00:35:30.350,00:35:32.800
"Or at least explain
what you're doing.",00:35:32.800,00:35:34.940
"So extract min is going
to give us the key.",00:35:34.940,00:35:38.390
"And it's going to give
us index in the heap.",00:35:38.390,00:35:40.830
What do we do afterwards?,00:35:40.830,00:35:41.970
"AUDIENCE: We add to
[INAUDIBLE] H of--",00:35:46.052,00:35:48.870
"PROFESSOR: All right
so when we take out 2--",00:35:48.870,00:35:53.430
"so we start out with
an horizon of 2.",00:35:53.430,00:35:55.430
"When we take it out 2's the
only thing that's in the horizon",00:35:55.430,00:35:58.610
first.,00:35:58.610,00:35:59.110
"Then we take it out and its two
children get in the horizon.",00:35:59.110,00:36:03.540
"Then we take out
one of the children",00:36:03.540,00:36:06.300
"and put its children
in the horizon.",00:36:06.300,00:36:09.564
"So when we take
out a node we want",00:36:09.564,00:36:10.980
"to put its children
in the horizon.",00:36:10.980,00:36:13.400
So we're going to say Z dot--,00:36:13.400,00:36:15.790
AUDIENCE: Insert.,00:36:15.790,00:36:17.640
PROFESSOR: Insert.,00:36:17.640,00:36:19.740
What do I insert?,00:36:19.740,00:36:22.800
AUDIENCE: H of I times 2.,00:36:22.800,00:36:26.055
j times 2.,00:36:26.055,00:36:27.406
PROFESSOR: See?,00:36:27.406,00:36:28.030
It's working already.,00:36:28.030,00:36:31.330
"The job security
thing is working.",00:36:31.330,00:36:33.010
And?,00:36:33.010,00:36:35.206
AUDIENCE: 2j plus 1.,00:36:35.206,00:36:36.630
You have to do two lines.,00:36:40.940,00:36:42.825
"PROFESSOR: OK, sweet.",00:36:42.825,00:36:43.700
OK.,00:36:57.990,00:36:59.920
Does this work?,00:36:59.920,00:37:01.214
"I mean does this do what
we wanted it to do earlier?",00:37:01.214,00:37:03.380
"AUDIENCE: Wait,
we're extracting oh--",00:37:08.260,00:37:11.188
PROFESSOR: All right first nod.,00:37:16.304,00:37:17.595
"AUDIENCE: I mean if
K is small enough.",00:37:21.710,00:37:24.146
"Eventually you'll ask for
something that is out of range.",00:37:24.146,00:37:29.940
"PROFESSOR: Oh so you're
thinking that eventually these",00:37:29.940,00:37:32.700
will run out of range.,00:37:32.700,00:37:33.617
"AUDIENCE: If you have
your really lopsided array",00:37:33.617,00:37:35.616
"eventually you'll ask for
something that's [INAUDIBLE].",00:37:35.616,00:37:37.950
"PROFESSOR: OK what would
we want to do in that case?",00:37:37.950,00:37:42.150
"AUDIENCE: Just want to check to
make sure that the [INAUDIBLE].",00:37:42.150,00:37:46.764
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, but
otherwise move on, right?",00:37:46.764,00:37:48.680
"If an element doesn't have kids,
we don't add on to the horizon.",00:37:48.680,00:37:52.600
"So we need some bounce
checks, exception checking,",00:37:52.600,00:37:56.540
things like that in here.,00:37:56.540,00:37:58.390
"And I won't add
that because that",00:37:58.390,00:37:59.880
will make it look long and ugly.,00:37:59.880,00:38:01.990
So this is the idea.,00:38:01.990,00:38:05.350
"OK what's the running
time for this?",00:38:05.350,00:38:06.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:38:09.774,00:38:10.690
PROFESSOR: Cool.,00:38:14.530,00:38:15.520
"So creating heaps, initializing,
all order 1, insertion,",00:38:15.520,00:38:22.020
this heap is almost empty now.,00:38:22.020,00:38:23.400
So this is order 1.,00:38:23.400,00:38:25.030
Then these happen K times.,00:38:25.030,00:38:28.520
"And these are all
operations on the heap Z.",00:38:28.520,00:38:32.070
"And the heap for the heap Z,
it has some number of elements.",00:38:32.070,00:38:37.090
"And it's not always going
to have one element,",00:38:37.090,00:38:40.570
"because every time
I'm extracting",00:38:40.570,00:38:42.010
one element I'm adding two.,00:38:42.010,00:38:43.450
"So well how many elements
is it going to have at most?",00:38:43.450,00:38:49.461
AUDIENCE: K.,00:38:49.461,00:38:49.960
PROFESSOR: OK why is that?,00:38:49.960,00:38:51.961
"AUDIENCE: Because each time
you add it it's one element.",00:38:51.961,00:38:54.850
"PROFESSOR: So I
extract one for sure.",00:38:54.850,00:38:56.430
"And then I add at
most two elements.",00:38:56.430,00:38:58.760
"So the heap size grows by at
most 1 in every iteration.",00:38:58.760,00:39:03.070
"So the heap size Z will
have at most K elements.",00:39:03.070,00:39:07.550
"So now I know the running
for all these operations.",00:39:11.030,00:39:13.270
What is it?,00:39:13.270,00:39:15.350
Log K. Cool.,00:39:15.350,00:39:18.680
"So it's K times log K. And
the reason that it works,",00:39:18.680,00:39:24.440
it's a bit harder to see.,00:39:24.440,00:39:26.270
"You have to convince yourself
maybe using this bigger tree,",00:39:26.270,00:39:29.440
"that whenever you're spending
expanding the horizon",00:39:29.440,00:39:31.800
"you're expanding
it the right way.",00:39:31.800,00:39:34.250
"So the idea is
again that whatever",00:39:34.250,00:39:37.600
"path you take down you're
going to see ascending numbers.",00:39:37.600,00:39:42.760
"So when you're
increasing the horizon",00:39:42.760,00:39:44.360
"you're always pushing
it down in such a way",00:39:44.360,00:39:47.220
"that your invariant is that
all the numbers in the horizon",00:39:47.220,00:39:52.100
are smaller then their children.,00:39:52.100,00:39:55.140
And so on and so forth.,00:39:55.140,00:39:57.260
"So the horizon is
always guaranteed",00:39:57.260,00:39:59.040
"to have the smallest number
that you haven't extracted yet.",00:39:59.040,00:40:02.330
"And that's really the
only thing you need.",00:40:02.330,00:40:04.372
OK does this make some sense?,00:40:07.230,00:40:10.430
"AUDIENCE: It never would have
occurred to me on an exam.",00:40:10.430,00:40:13.471
PROFESSOR: Yeah exactly.,00:40:13.471,00:40:14.470
"This would not occur on an
exam unless you think a lot,",00:40:14.470,00:40:17.610
"you're super inspired, all that.",00:40:17.610,00:40:19.640
"If it doesn't occur
to you what do you do?",00:40:19.640,00:40:22.570
"AUDIENCE: Go with
the N log K solution.",00:40:22.570,00:40:24.970
"PROFESSOR: OK, very good.",00:40:24.970,00:40:26.410
Wait.,00:40:26.410,00:40:27.138
AUDIENCE: K log N.,00:40:27.138,00:40:28.890
"PROFESSOR: OK, K log N
or N log K, which one?",00:40:28.890,00:40:32.450
AUDIENCE: K log N.,00:40:32.450,00:40:33.740
PROFESSOR: Why?,00:40:33.740,00:40:34.370
Two reasons.,00:40:34.370,00:40:36.840
"K log N is-- so two
reasons, faster and simpler.",00:40:36.840,00:40:40.630
So you write this down.,00:40:44.510,00:40:47.110
"And you get half score or 3/4
of the score and you're done.",00:40:47.110,00:40:53.510
"It's better than
nothing, anything,",00:40:53.510,00:40:55.240
"and getting a 0, right?",00:40:55.240,00:40:57.630
"I mean 3/4 of a score for
two lines of pseudocode",00:40:57.630,00:41:01.560
"is reasonable, right?",00:41:01.560,00:41:03.854
Two or three lines.,00:41:03.854,00:41:04.645
This is three lines probably.,00:41:04.645,00:41:06.231
"Also on most exams
we're humans, right?",00:41:10.160,00:41:13.510
"We might mess them up, we
might make them too long.",00:41:13.510,00:41:16.394
"If we make them
too long, you want",00:41:16.394,00:41:17.810
"to get the most
number of points.",00:41:17.810,00:41:20.610
"You'll have time to
figure out one or two",00:41:20.610,00:41:23.050
problems at that level.,00:41:23.050,00:41:24.170
"But if we give you too
many, for the rest of them",00:41:24.170,00:41:26.397
"you want to have
something simple that",00:41:26.397,00:41:27.980
gives you some of the points.,00:41:27.980,00:41:30.954
Same for an interview.,00:41:30.954,00:41:31.870
"For most interviews
most people don't really",00:41:31.870,00:41:34.060
"have a clue how many
problems you can solve,",00:41:34.060,00:41:37.670
"how many problems
are reasonable.",00:41:37.670,00:41:39.420
"So you want, for
every problem you",00:41:39.420,00:41:41.350
"want to show some
solution reasonably fast.",00:41:41.350,00:41:44.890
And then see if they're happy.,00:41:44.890,00:41:46.589
"And if they're happy move
on to the next problem.",00:41:46.589,00:41:48.630
"And if they're not happy
only then spend more time.",00:41:48.630,00:41:51.990
So this is as important as that.,00:41:51.990,00:41:54.960
"If you look at the recitation
notes we'll have some problems",00:41:54.960,00:41:58.100
and we'll have some solutions.,00:41:58.100,00:42:00.076
"What are going to do,
memorize the solutions?",00:42:00.076,00:42:01.950
"Yay, you know how to
solve more problems.",00:42:01.950,00:42:03.540
"There are probably a
million problems in total.",00:42:03.540,00:42:05.498
That doesn't get you very far.,00:42:05.498,00:42:07.904
"So what you want is to
understand this process",00:42:07.904,00:42:09.820
that we went through.,00:42:09.820,00:42:10.694
"So every time we tried
something we got from some point",00:42:10.694,00:42:14.782
"to some point with a
better running time.",00:42:14.782,00:42:16.490
Well except for here.,00:42:16.490,00:42:17.850
"And where we had more
insight on the problem.",00:42:17.850,00:42:19.890
So this is the important part.,00:42:19.890,00:42:23.030
"And I'm going to show you one
more problem, really quickly.",00:42:23.030,00:42:27.080
"We're probably not going
to be able to solve it,",00:42:27.080,00:42:29.200
because it's hard.,00:42:29.200,00:42:30.660
"But we are going
to talk about it",00:42:30.660,00:42:32.660
"and see if we can
get some insight.",00:42:32.660,00:42:36.300
"Let's see, what do
I want to erase?",00:42:36.300,00:42:38.730
This.,00:42:38.730,00:42:39.968
I like that.,00:42:39.968,00:42:41.462
"All right, so we have an array
random numbers, 7, 2, 5--",00:43:02.910,00:43:07.380
"this time there's no
order in it-- 8, 9, 4.",00:43:07.380,00:43:15.020
"And we tell you that the
array has 2 to the N numbers,",00:43:15.020,00:43:18.340
to make the problem easier.,00:43:18.340,00:43:20.280
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.",00:43:20.280,00:43:22.534
6.,00:43:26.390,00:43:27.840
So you have this array.,00:43:27.840,00:43:30.030
"And we want to answer
queries of this shape.",00:43:30.030,00:43:33.580
"Say this array is E,
and it has N elements,",00:43:33.580,00:43:37.080
"and you know that N
is some 2 to the K.",00:43:37.080,00:43:40.750
"Minimum of all the
elements from i to j.",00:43:40.750,00:43:45.240
"So you have two
phases, just like we",00:43:47.870,00:43:49.552
had on a problem on the exam.,00:43:49.552,00:43:50.760
"You have a pre-processing
stage where you get the array,",00:43:50.760,00:43:53.093
"you do some computation,
you save some information.",00:43:53.093,00:43:56.342
"And then you have
a querying phase,",00:43:56.342,00:43:57.800
"where you have to answer
these as fast as possible.",00:43:57.800,00:44:02.280
"I see most people
have unhappy faces.",00:44:02.280,00:44:04.310
"Bad memories, huh?",00:44:04.310,00:44:06.740
"OK let's not worry
about that problem.",00:44:06.740,00:44:09.780
Let's look at this one.,00:44:09.780,00:44:11.820
"So assuming you have
as much time as you",00:44:11.820,00:44:14.210
"want to do the
pre-processing, what's",00:44:14.210,00:44:16.900
"the fastest way you
could answer these?",00:44:16.900,00:44:20.260
Yes?,00:44:20.260,00:44:22.065
"AUDIENCE: If you
had as much time",00:44:22.065,00:44:23.460
"for pre-processing
[INAUDIBLE] memorize it.",00:44:23.460,00:44:27.055
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:44:27.055,00:44:27.930
"So if we compute the answers to
all possible solutions, right?",00:44:27.930,00:44:32.510
How would I store that?,00:44:32.510,00:44:34.770
So I want to do this in order 1.,00:44:34.770,00:44:37.930
"So how would I
store these answers?",00:44:37.930,00:44:40.266
AUDIENCE: Just sort your array.,00:44:40.266,00:44:43.220
"PROFESSOR: OK so
I sort my array.",00:44:43.220,00:44:44.885
"AUDIENCE: Then you want
the minimum from i to j,",00:44:44.885,00:44:47.830
"so look at the ith element
and that's your [INAUDIBLE].",00:44:47.830,00:44:50.770
PROFESSOR: OK so figure it out?,00:44:59.610,00:45:01.650
"Well I mean if I can sort
it I can also say hey,",00:45:04.690,00:45:06.921
"why don't we use
this array instead?",00:45:06.921,00:45:08.420
"And then I'll
answer the queries.",00:45:12.016,00:45:13.390
"You can go off a tangent
trying to sort the elements",00:45:18.820,00:45:21.600
and keep their keys.,00:45:21.600,00:45:22.550
"The important thing is if
you think about it for awhile",00:45:22.550,00:45:25.230
"and you see that things
stop making sense, back out.",00:45:25.230,00:45:27.570
Look somewhere else.,00:45:27.570,00:45:29.627
"We spent some time trying
to find a solution based",00:45:29.627,00:45:31.710
on sorting in my last section.,00:45:31.710,00:45:34.410
It's not going to work.,00:45:34.410,00:45:36.030
So--,00:45:36.030,00:45:38.252
"AUDIENCE: Can't you just take
the [INAUDIBLE] from i to j?",00:45:38.252,00:45:42.570
"PROFESSOR: OK let's
get to that in a bit.",00:45:45.032,00:45:46.740
So let's keep that in mind.,00:45:46.740,00:45:47.865
"Because that's another point
on the trade off curve.",00:45:47.865,00:45:50.960
"So if I want to serve
my queries in order 1,",00:45:50.960,00:45:54.970
"then the way I do that is I will
have a hash of all the arrays",00:45:54.970,00:46:01.780
"that look like i, j.",00:46:01.780,00:46:04.100
So all the possible intervals.,00:46:04.100,00:46:08.790
And I'll store the answer here.,00:46:08.790,00:46:12.830
"The minimum the
elements from i to j.",00:46:12.830,00:46:18.200
"And I can do a hash lookup
in order 1 and get the answer",00:46:18.200,00:46:20.950
and return the answer.,00:46:20.950,00:46:23.490
"How many elements
so I have here?",00:46:23.490,00:46:25.080
"So how much storage do
I have to use for this?",00:46:28.760,00:46:31.739
AUDIENCE: O of N squared.,00:46:31.739,00:46:32.780
"PROFESSOR: OK N values for this,
N values for this, so roughly",00:46:32.780,00:46:38.560
N squared.,00:46:38.560,00:46:40.540
"What's the time
for computing this?",00:46:40.540,00:46:43.620
"Brute force, let's not think.",00:46:43.620,00:46:44.930
"What's the time
for computing this?",00:46:44.930,00:46:48.314
AUDIENCE: N cubed.,00:46:48.314,00:46:49.280
PROFESSOR: N cubed.,00:46:49.280,00:46:50.179
You're thinking.,00:46:50.179,00:46:50.845
"So I have unsquared
elements here.",00:46:54.290,00:46:56.370
"For every element
I have to compute",00:46:56.370,00:46:59.060
"the minimum of potentially
order N elements, right?",00:46:59.060,00:47:04.330
So this is N cubed.,00:47:04.330,00:47:05.350
"I could reduce it to N squared
by noticing that if I have",00:47:05.350,00:47:08.110
"the minimum of these
elements, and I",00:47:08.110,00:47:10.390
"want to compute the
minimum of these elements,",00:47:10.390,00:47:13.050
"really all I have to
do is compute, compare",00:47:13.050,00:47:14.980
this minimum with this element.,00:47:14.980,00:47:18.000
"So every time I start
with an interval of size 1",00:47:18.000,00:47:20.730
and then I expand it by 1.,00:47:20.730,00:47:22.550
So I have my two for loops here.,00:47:22.550,00:47:24.350
And I keep growing my minimum.,00:47:24.350,00:47:27.310
"So I could get down to
order of N squared times.",00:47:27.310,00:47:33.025
"So I have one solution
that has order",00:47:37.210,00:47:41.750
"of N squared time and
space, and then answers",00:47:41.750,00:47:44.280
the queries in order 1.,00:47:44.280,00:47:46.480
"You had a solution you
said where, what you do",00:47:46.480,00:47:49.790
"is, when you get a query
you compute this, right?",00:47:49.790,00:47:53.890
"You were suggesting
sorting the array.",00:47:53.890,00:47:55.890
"That would be N log N. I
would suggest not sorting it.",00:47:55.890,00:47:58.715
"Do the splicing, you look
through all the elements,",00:47:58.715,00:48:00.840
and you find the minimum.,00:48:00.840,00:48:03.596
"AUDIENCE: I was saying that
if the original E spans i to j",00:48:03.596,00:48:06.844
and started at the--,00:48:06.844,00:48:08.660
"PROFESSOR: So when you
get a query the i's",00:48:08.660,00:48:10.410
and j's change for every query.,00:48:10.410,00:48:14.300
"Otherwise we could
compute the answer.",00:48:14.300,00:48:16.710
"So we have one answer
where we take order",00:48:16.710,00:48:21.300
N time to answer a query.,00:48:21.300,00:48:23.510
"And what do we do
for pre-processing?",00:48:23.510,00:48:25.768
Nothing.,00:48:32.400,00:48:32.900
Order 1.,00:48:32.900,00:48:34.940
"So these are two ends
of a trade off, right?",00:48:34.940,00:48:39.350
"One possible extreme is that you
pre-compute all your answers.",00:48:39.350,00:48:43.257
"The other possible extreme
is that you don't do anything",00:48:43.257,00:48:45.590
"and you brute
force every answer.",00:48:45.590,00:48:47.590
"And now we want to
find a point somewhere",00:48:47.590,00:48:49.704
"on this line between
the extremes.",00:48:49.704,00:48:51.120
"So the answer that we're
going to show in the solutions",00:48:55.320,00:48:57.800
uses order N log N space.,00:48:57.800,00:49:05.980
"And it answers
the query by using",00:49:05.980,00:49:09.240
"order 1 elements in this
order N log N data structure.",00:49:09.240,00:49:17.580
"So I have order N
log N partial minima.",00:49:17.580,00:49:20.550
And I will only use two of them.,00:49:20.550,00:49:24.540
"So the total running time
isn't actually order 1.",00:49:24.540,00:49:28.300
"But we only use
order 1 elements.",00:49:28.300,00:49:30.898
"Let's start thinking
very quickly.",00:49:35.350,00:49:39.600
"Let's think for about a
minute, and then we'll",00:49:39.600,00:49:42.070
go through the solution.,00:49:42.070,00:49:44.460
"And there are
multiple solutions.",00:49:44.460,00:49:45.864
"All of them are interesting
in different ways.",00:49:45.864,00:49:47.780
"And there are other
solutions that",00:49:47.780,00:49:50.200
"are equally fun and applicable
with not the same running time.",00:49:50.200,00:49:55.002
Let me make some space here.,00:50:00.820,00:50:02.155
"So like I said, thinking is
a useful process on its own.",00:50:26.647,00:50:28.980
"So you're getting better
just by doing this.",00:50:28.980,00:50:31.510
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] using
more than one space total?",00:50:35.010,00:50:38.760
"PROFESSOR: We're
using N log N space.",00:50:38.760,00:50:40.520
"AUDIENCE: Oh and it
takes constant time--",00:50:40.520,00:50:43.106
"PROFESSOR: It will only
look at two elements.",00:50:43.106,00:50:44.980
It's actually not constant time.,00:50:44.980,00:50:46.313
"We're not going to worry
too much about time.",00:50:46.313,00:50:48.730
It turns out being log.,00:50:48.730,00:50:51.722
"AUDIENCE: Ok, what
was the order 1 then?",00:50:51.722,00:50:53.700
"PROFESSOR: You only
access order 1 elements.",00:50:53.700,00:50:56.440
Order 1 partial minimum.,00:50:56.440,00:50:58.854
"AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.",00:50:58.854,00:50:59.562
"Does it have to do
with two different K?",00:51:04.442,00:51:07.370
PROFESSOR: Maybe.,00:51:07.370,00:51:08.346
"AUDIENCE: I don't know
what to do with that.",00:51:08.346,00:51:12.738
"There's probably some
sort of tree involved.",00:51:12.738,00:51:14.770
"PROFESSOR: So you're going to
want to split things, right?",00:51:21.120,00:51:23.536
Into halves.,00:51:23.536,00:51:25.130
"And you're going to want to be
able to do this all the time.",00:51:25.130,00:51:28.020
"And we say 2 to the K so we
don't have to worry about,",00:51:28.020,00:51:30.800
"oh my God what happens if
the halves aren't equal?",00:51:30.800,00:51:33.384
"You can usually solve this
when you implement the problem.",00:51:33.384,00:51:35.800
"But it's useful
to not worry about",00:51:35.800,00:51:38.000
"that when you come up
with your first algorithm.",00:51:38.000,00:51:41.760
"If you're going to start
dividing in halves.",00:51:41.760,00:51:43.656
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:51:53.586,00:51:54.502
PROFESSOR: Um.,00:51:59.460,00:52:00.415
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:52:00.415,00:52:01.331
"PROFESSOR: So that leads
to another useful solution.",00:52:04.740,00:52:08.090
"That leads to a solution
that takes-- that has N log N",00:52:08.090,00:52:12.060
"storage and it will
run in N log N time",00:52:12.060,00:52:14.340
with N log N element axes.,00:52:14.340,00:52:17.210
"So what you thinking
of is you're",00:52:17.210,00:52:18.790
"going to have your array
of elements, right?",00:52:18.790,00:52:21.710
"And say you want to find the
minimum from here to here.",00:52:21.710,00:52:25.510
"You're going to have
your array split in half.",00:52:25.510,00:52:28.380
"So you're going to find
the minimum of this,",00:52:28.380,00:52:31.620
and the minimum of this.,00:52:31.620,00:52:33.377
"But to do that you'll
have to recurse.",00:52:33.377,00:52:34.960
"So this is also
say split in half.",00:52:34.960,00:52:37.075
"So you'll have to
find-- so it turns out",00:52:37.075,00:52:40.550
"that if you do this,
in the end you'll",00:52:40.550,00:52:42.340
"have log N minima that
you have to look at.",00:52:42.340,00:52:46.300
"But this is more, this is a
cooler and more useful thing,",00:52:46.300,00:52:49.600
"so I'll try to put it
on a PSet or something",00:52:49.600,00:52:51.570
to make you think about it.,00:52:51.570,00:52:53.820
"So this is-- don't
tell people yet.",00:52:53.820,00:52:55.526
"You might have a
solution to a problem.",00:52:55.526,00:52:57.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:53:05.880,00:53:07.350
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:53:07.350,00:53:09.100
"So what we thought of, or the
way we thought of doing it,",00:53:09.100,00:53:13.100
"is 6, 7, 2, 5, 3, 8, 9, 4.",00:53:13.100,00:53:19.870
"So we compute these
partial minima.",00:53:19.870,00:53:21.630
We split the array into two.,00:53:21.630,00:53:23.930
"And these are the
minima that we compute.",00:53:23.930,00:53:28.313
"Sorry, this is like
this, this is like this.",00:53:32.480,00:53:35.994
"So everything, so all the
left half then these guys,",00:53:38.940,00:53:42.022
"then these guys, then this guy.",00:53:42.022,00:53:44.510
"Everything here, then these
guys, then these guys,",00:53:44.510,00:53:48.510
then this guy.,00:53:48.510,00:53:50.220
"So if your i and j are on
different sides of the middle,",00:53:50.220,00:53:55.100
"then you do two
lookups, you're done.",00:53:55.100,00:53:58.110
"If they're in the
same half, then you",00:53:58.110,00:54:00.810
"have a problem
that's half the size.",00:54:00.810,00:54:02.759
"So you're going to have
to take this array that's",00:54:02.759,00:54:04.800
"half the size, 2, 5.",00:54:04.800,00:54:07.380
"Split it into halves
and do the same thing.",00:54:07.380,00:54:09.410
"And then we're going to have to
do the same to this other one.",00:54:12.290,00:54:15.690
"3, 8, 9, 4, split it into
halves and do the same thing.",00:54:15.690,00:54:19.450
"So in the end you'll
end up in someplace",00:54:23.010,00:54:25.110
"where your interval ages are on
different sides of the middle.",00:54:25.110,00:54:29.410
"And you look at two
elements and you're done.",00:54:29.410,00:54:33.420
"Let's see how much
space this takes.",00:54:33.420,00:54:35.860
"Can someone tell me a
recursion for how much",00:54:35.860,00:54:38.770
"space, for how many minimums
I would need to keep?",00:54:38.770,00:54:45.220
So space for an elements is?,00:54:45.220,00:54:47.220
"AUDIENCE: The first
level you have 8.",00:54:51.070,00:54:54.990
So go down by an order of 2.,00:54:54.990,00:54:59.390
"PROFESSOR: So what's
the first level?",00:54:59.390,00:55:01.780
AUDIENCE: Of 8 N.,00:55:01.780,00:55:03.010
PROFESSOR: So order N plus?,00:55:03.010,00:55:05.200
AUDIENCE: N over 2?,00:55:08.310,00:55:09.550
t of N over 2?,00:55:09.550,00:55:10.682
"PROFESSOR: OK S
because it's space.",00:55:10.682,00:55:12.140
N over 2.,00:55:12.140,00:55:13.560
OK.,00:55:13.560,00:55:16.045
And?,00:55:16.045,00:55:16.545
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:55:18.750,00:55:19.666
"PROFESSOR: You're
missing something.",00:55:22.940,00:55:24.660
Look at this picture.,00:55:24.660,00:55:25.930
So this is the whole thing.,00:55:25.930,00:55:27.970
Then I have a half.,00:55:27.970,00:55:29.590
And then what else do I have?,00:55:29.590,00:55:33.120
AUDIENCE: 2.,00:55:33.120,00:55:33.910
PROFESSOR: The other half.,00:55:33.910,00:55:35.008
"AUDIENCE: Oh, 2.",00:55:35.008,00:55:36.229
"PROFESSOR: OK so the
difference between these two",00:55:36.229,00:55:38.270
"is that one of them
gives you order N,",00:55:38.270,00:55:39.853
"the other one gives you N log
N. So I gave you the answer,",00:55:39.853,00:55:43.170
"so I can't ask you
for the answer now.",00:55:43.170,00:55:45.050
"But where did we
see this before?",00:55:45.050,00:55:46.870
Pretend these are t's.,00:55:46.870,00:55:48.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:55:48.130,00:55:49.310
PROFESSOR: Sorry?,00:55:49.310,00:55:50.620
"So these are t's, this is the
recursion for [? more sort ?].",00:55:50.620,00:55:53.450
"So once you put it up you
don't draw the recursion tree",00:55:53.450,00:55:56.049
and solve it.,00:55:56.049,00:55:56.590
"You say this is what we saw
in [? more sort. ?] Therefore,",00:55:56.590,00:55:59.270
"the solution is N
log N. So this is",00:55:59.270,00:56:05.720
"how you show you
have N log N space,",00:56:05.720,00:56:07.380
"and it's pretty clear
that you're only",00:56:07.380,00:56:09.290
going to access two elements.,00:56:09.290,00:56:10.975
"AUDIENCE: I don't
understand how [INAUDIBLE].",00:56:10.975,00:56:12.875
PROFESSOR: How it works?,00:56:16.680,00:56:18.070
"So you have your i
and you have your j.",00:56:18.070,00:56:23.340
Let's make that one i here.,00:56:23.340,00:56:25.250
"If you want to find
the minimum, if i and j",00:56:25.250,00:56:27.385
"are on different sides of the
half, you have this and this.",00:56:27.385,00:56:33.550
"And these two partial minima
cover your entire interval.",00:56:33.550,00:56:36.060
"Now if they're on the
same side of the half then",00:56:39.830,00:56:44.630
"you recurse to a
smaller problem.",00:56:44.630,00:56:47.121
"AUDIENCE: Well you don't have
to there because you already",00:56:47.121,00:56:49.537
"have the minimum
of that section.",00:56:49.537,00:56:52.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:56:52.140,00:56:53.875
"AUDIENCE: It wouldn't work
if you had 6 and 2, right?",00:56:53.875,00:56:57.280
Or that.,00:56:57.280,00:56:59.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:56:59.220,00:57:00.636
"AUDIENCE: Well why not
just take 7 and 2 then?",00:57:00.636,00:57:03.410
"Why do you have to break
up the entire panel?",00:57:03.410,00:57:05.657
"PROFESSOR: Assume there's
more things there.",00:57:05.657,00:57:07.490
AUDIENCE: Oh I see.,00:57:10.490,00:57:11.440
"PROFESSOR: So if you have this,
now it's no longer true, right?",00:57:11.440,00:57:16.660
"So wherever they are
here, you do that.",00:57:16.660,00:57:19.830
"And remember your pseudocode
has to be as simple as possible",00:57:19.830,00:57:22.670
"to reduce the
probability of bugs.",00:57:22.670,00:57:24.730
"So you want to do the
simplest possible thing,",00:57:24.730,00:57:26.870
not have special cases.,00:57:26.870,00:57:29.680
OK.,00:57:29.680,00:57:31.670
"By the way there's
a study that shows",00:57:31.670,00:57:33.450
"that for good or bad
programmers, if you have",00:57:33.450,00:57:37.080
"1,000 lines of code, there's a
constant probability of a bug.",00:57:37.080,00:57:40.724
"And the constants are
different for good",00:57:40.724,00:57:42.390
"versus bad programmers,
but it's still a constant.",00:57:42.390,00:57:45.830
"So how many mistakes
you make is directly",00:57:45.830,00:57:49.030
"proportional to
how much you write.",00:57:49.030,00:57:50.957
"This is why we like
simple solutions.",00:57:50.957,00:57:52.498
"OK, any questions on this?",00:57:55.850,00:57:59.350
So we have four problems.,00:57:59.350,00:58:00.990
We didn't cover one.,00:58:00.990,00:58:02.390
"Look at the other one,
look at the solution.",00:58:02.390,00:58:04.830
"Ideally look at the problem,
think for at least half",00:58:04.830,00:58:07.120
"an hour, then look
at the solution.",00:58:07.120,00:58:09.320
"What I want you to take
away is not just oh, here",00:58:09.320,00:58:11.792
"are three problems, let's
memorize how we solve them.",00:58:11.792,00:58:14.000
"But the whole process
thing, and how",00:58:14.000,00:58:15.780
"we played with data structures
and how we used all the hints",00:58:15.780,00:58:19.100
"that we possibly could to build
more insights into the problem.",00:58:19.100,00:58:23.170
"OK, cool.",00:58:23.170,00:58:25.020
