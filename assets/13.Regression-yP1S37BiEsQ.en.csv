"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: It's
because if I was not,",00:00:20.292,00:00:22.790
"this would be basically the
last topic we would ever see.",00:00:22.790,00:00:25.640
"And this is arguably, probably
the most important topic",00:00:25.640,00:00:29.201
"in statistics, or at
least that's probably",00:00:29.201,00:00:30.950
"the reason why most of
you are taking this class.",00:00:30.950,00:00:33.470
"Because regression
implies prediction,",00:00:33.470,00:00:36.980
"and prediction is what people
are after to now, right?",00:00:36.980,00:00:39.260
"You don't need to
understand what",00:00:39.260,00:00:40.340
"the model for the
financial market",00:00:40.340,00:00:41.960
"is if you actually
have a formula",00:00:41.960,00:00:43.460
"to predict what the stock
prices are going to be tomorrow.",00:00:43.460,00:00:47.430
"And regression, in a way,
allows us to do that.",00:00:47.430,00:00:49.705
"And we'll start with a very
simple version of regression,",00:00:49.705,00:00:52.080
"which is linear regression,
which is the most standard one.",00:00:52.080,00:00:55.130
"And then we'll move on to
slightly more advanced notions",00:00:55.130,00:00:58.070
"such as nonparametric
regression.",00:00:58.070,00:00:59.560
"At least, we're going to see
the principles behind it.",00:00:59.560,00:01:02.960
"And I'll touch upon a little bit
of high dimensional regression,",00:01:02.960,00:01:06.570
"which is what people
are doing today.",00:01:06.570,00:01:09.450
"So the goal of
regression is to try",00:01:09.450,00:01:12.290
"to predict one variable
based on another variable.",00:01:12.290,00:01:16.220
"All right, so here the
notation is very important.",00:01:16.220,00:01:19.290
It's extremely standard.,00:01:19.290,00:01:22.220
"It goes everywhere essentially,
and essentially you're",00:01:22.220,00:01:25.600
"trying to explain why
as a function of x,",00:01:25.600,00:01:29.840
"which is the usual y
equals f of x question--",00:01:29.840,00:01:33.320
"except that, you know, if
you look at a calculus class,",00:01:33.320,00:01:36.090
"people tell you y equals
f of x, and they give you",00:01:36.090,00:01:39.930
"a specific form for f,
and then you do something.",00:01:39.930,00:01:42.142
"Here, we're just going
to try to estimate",00:01:42.142,00:01:43.850
what this length function is.,00:01:43.850,00:01:46.040
"And this is why we often
call y the explained variable",00:01:46.040,00:01:49.790
and x the explanatory variable.,00:01:49.790,00:01:52.800
"All right, so we're
statisticians,",00:01:52.800,00:01:55.960
so we start with data.,00:01:55.960,00:01:56.925
"All right, then what
does our data look like?",00:01:56.925,00:01:58.800
"Well, it looks like a
bunch of input, output",00:01:58.800,00:02:01.820
to this relationship.,00:02:01.820,00:02:03.110
"All right, so we have
a bunch of xi, yi.",00:02:03.110,00:02:05.870
"Those are pairs, and I can do
a scatterplot of those guys.",00:02:05.870,00:02:09.280
"So each point here has a
x-coordinate, which is xi,",00:02:09.280,00:02:14.390
"and a y-coordinate,
which is yi, and here, I",00:02:14.390,00:02:16.550
have a bunch of endpoints.,00:02:16.550,00:02:17.810
And I just draw them like that.,00:02:17.810,00:02:19.830
"Now, the functions we're
going to be interested in",00:02:19.830,00:02:23.700
"are often function of the form
y equals a plus b times x, OK.",00:02:23.700,00:02:30.170
"And that means that this
function looks like this.",00:02:30.170,00:02:32.870
"So if I do x and
y, this function",00:02:36.310,00:02:38.200
"looks exactly like a line,
and clearly those points",00:02:38.200,00:02:41.530
are not on the line.,00:02:41.530,00:02:42.980
"And it will basically
never happen",00:02:42.980,00:02:44.577
that those points are on a line.,00:02:44.577,00:02:45.910
"There's a famous
T-shirt from, I think,",00:02:45.910,00:02:48.460
"U.C. Berkeley's
staff department,",00:02:48.460,00:02:50.320
"that shows this picture
and put a line between them",00:02:50.320,00:02:52.736
like we're going to see it.,00:02:52.736,00:02:53.860
"And it says, oh,
statisticians, so many points,",00:02:53.860,00:02:56.890
"and you still managed
to miss all of them.",00:02:56.890,00:02:59.590
"And so essentially, we don't
believe that this relationship",00:02:59.590,00:03:04.150
"y is equal to a plus bx is true,
but maybe up to some noise.",00:03:04.150,00:03:08.912
"And that's where the statistics
is going to come into play.",00:03:08.912,00:03:11.370
"There's going to be some random
noise that's going to play out,",00:03:11.370,00:03:13.995
"and hopefully the noise is
going to be spread out evenly,",00:03:13.995,00:03:17.470
"so that we can average it
if we have enough points.",00:03:17.470,00:03:20.950
"Average it out, OK.",00:03:20.950,00:03:22.830
"And so this epsilon here is not
necessarily due to randomness.",00:03:22.830,00:03:26.910
"But again, just like we did
modeling in the first place,",00:03:26.910,00:03:29.387
"it essentially
accounts for everything",00:03:29.387,00:03:30.970
"we don't understand
about this relationship.",00:03:30.970,00:03:33.520
"All right, so for example--",00:03:33.520,00:03:36.200
"so here, I'm not going to be--",00:03:36.200,00:03:37.630
"give me one second, so we'll
see an example in a second.",00:03:37.630,00:03:41.960
"But the idea here is
that if you have data,",00:03:41.960,00:03:44.050
"and if you believe
that it's of the form,",00:03:44.050,00:03:45.850
"a plus b x plus
some noise, you're",00:03:45.850,00:03:47.740
"trying to find the line
that will explain your data",00:03:47.740,00:03:50.410
"the best, right?",00:03:50.410,00:03:51.640
"In the terminology
we've been using before,",00:03:51.640,00:03:54.650
"this would be the most likely
line that explains the data.",00:03:54.650,00:03:58.060
"So we can see that
it's slightly--",00:03:58.060,00:03:59.680
"we've just added
another dimension",00:03:59.680,00:04:01.145
to our statistical problem.,00:04:01.145,00:04:02.270
"We don't have just x's,
but we have y's, and we're",00:04:02.270,00:04:04.353
"trying to find the most likely
explanation of the relationship",00:04:04.353,00:04:07.450
between y and x.,00:04:07.450,00:04:09.220
"All right, and so
in practice, the way",00:04:09.220,00:04:12.379
"it's going to look like is that
we're going to have basically",00:04:12.379,00:04:14.920
"two parameters to
find the slope b",00:04:14.920,00:04:17.470
"and the intercept
a, and given data,",00:04:17.470,00:04:20.240
"the goal is going to be to try
to find the best possible line.",00:04:20.240,00:04:23.120
All right?,00:04:23.120,00:04:24.514
"So what we're going
to find is not",00:04:24.514,00:04:25.930
"exactly a and b, the ones that
actually generate the data,",00:04:25.930,00:04:29.310
"but some estimators of those
parameters, a hat and b hat",00:04:29.310,00:04:33.790
constructed from the data.,00:04:33.790,00:04:35.680
"All right, so we'll see
that more generally,",00:04:35.680,00:04:38.260
"but we're not going to go too
much in the details of this.",00:04:38.260,00:04:40.990
"There's actually
quite a bit that you",00:04:40.990,00:04:42.190
"can understand if
you do what's called",00:04:42.190,00:04:43.773
"univariate regression
when x is actually",00:04:43.773,00:04:47.260
a real valued random variable.,00:04:47.260,00:04:49.940
"So when this happens, this is
called univariate regression.",00:04:49.940,00:04:52.720
"And when x is in rp for p
larger than or equal to 2,",00:04:59.640,00:05:05.550
"this is called
multivariate regression.",00:05:05.550,00:05:07.810
"OK, and so here we're
just trying to explain y",00:05:16.640,00:05:20.340
is a plus bx plus epsilon.,00:05:20.340,00:05:23.940
"And here we're going to have
something more complicated.",00:05:23.940,00:05:26.620
"We're going to have y, which is
equal to a plus b1, x1 plus b2,",00:05:26.620,00:05:33.510
"x2 plus bp, xp plus epsilon--",00:05:33.510,00:05:39.780
where x is equal to--,00:05:39.780,00:05:42.150
"the coordinates of x are
given by x1, 2xp, rp.",00:05:42.150,00:05:46.710
"OK, so it's still linear.",00:05:46.710,00:05:49.200
"Right, they still add
all the coordinates",00:05:49.200,00:05:51.030
"of x with a coefficient
in front of them,",00:05:51.030,00:05:53.370
"but it's a bit more complicated
than just one coefficient",00:05:53.370,00:05:56.360
"for one coordinate of x, OK?",00:05:56.360,00:05:58.770
"So we'll come back to
multivariate regression.",00:05:58.770,00:06:03.420
"Of course, you can write
this as x transpose b, right?",00:06:03.420,00:06:08.280
"So this entire thing here,
this linear combination",00:06:08.280,00:06:14.800
"is of the form x
transpose b, where",00:06:14.800,00:06:17.710
"b is the vector that has
coordinates b1 to bp.",00:06:17.710,00:06:23.310
OK?,00:06:23.310,00:06:25.700
"Sorry, here, it's in [? rd, ?]
p is the natural notation.",00:06:25.700,00:06:31.100
"All right, so our goal
here, in the univariate one,",00:06:31.100,00:06:35.660
"is to try to write
the model, make sense",00:06:35.660,00:06:38.360
of this little twiddle here--,00:06:38.360,00:06:40.910
"essentially, from a
statistical modeling question,",00:06:40.910,00:06:44.050
"the question is going to be,
what distributional assumptions",00:06:44.050,00:06:47.480
do you want to put on epsilon?,00:06:47.480,00:06:48.730
"Are you going to say
they're Gaussian?",00:06:48.730,00:06:50.313
"Are you going to say
they're binomial?",00:06:50.313,00:06:52.720
"OK, are you going to
say they're binomial?",00:07:00.160,00:07:03.450
"Are you going to say
they're Bernoulli?",00:07:03.450,00:07:05.532
"So that's going to be what we
we're going to make sense of,",00:07:05.532,00:07:07.990
"and then we're going
to try to find a method",00:07:07.990,00:07:10.230
to estimate a and b.,00:07:10.230,00:07:11.700
"And then maybe we're
going to try to do",00:07:11.700,00:07:13.680
some inference about a and b--,00:07:13.680,00:07:15.030
"maybe test if a and b take
certain values, if they're",00:07:15.030,00:07:18.390
"less than something,
maybe find some confidence",00:07:18.390,00:07:20.850
"regions for a and b, all right?",00:07:20.850,00:07:24.290
"So why would you
want to do this?",00:07:24.290,00:07:25.990
"Well, I'm sure all of you have
an application, if I give you",00:07:25.990,00:07:29.810
"some x, you're trying
to predict what y is.",00:07:29.810,00:07:32.260
"Machine learning is all
about doing this, right?",00:07:32.260,00:07:34.730
"Without maybe trying
to even understand",00:07:34.730,00:07:36.994
"the physics behind
this, they're saying,",00:07:36.994,00:07:38.660
"well, you give me
a bag of words,",00:07:38.660,00:07:40.590
"I want to understand whether
it's going to be a spam or not.",00:07:40.590,00:07:43.520
"You give me a bunch of
economic indicators,",00:07:43.520,00:07:47.370
"I want you to tell me how much
I should be selling my car for.",00:07:47.370,00:07:51.530
"You give me a bunch of
measurements on some patient,",00:07:51.530,00:07:55.774
"I want you to predict
how this person is",00:07:55.774,00:07:57.440
"going to respond to my
drug-- and things like this.",00:07:57.440,00:08:00.110
"All right, and often we actually
don't have much modeling",00:08:00.110,00:08:04.830
"intuition about what the
relationship between x and y",00:08:04.830,00:08:07.380
"is, and this linear thing is
basically the simplest function",00:08:07.380,00:08:10.350
we can think of.,00:08:10.350,00:08:11.530
"Arguably, linear functions
are the simplest functions",00:08:11.530,00:08:15.235
that are not trivial.,00:08:15.235,00:08:16.110
"Otherwise, we would just say,
well, let's just predict x of y",00:08:16.110,00:08:19.110
"to be a constant, meaning
it does not depend on x.",00:08:19.110,00:08:21.445
"But if you want it
to depend on x, then",00:08:21.445,00:08:23.070
"your functions are basically
as simple as it gets.",00:08:23.070,00:08:25.710
"It turns out, amazingly, this
does the trick quite often.",00:08:25.710,00:08:30.840
"So for example, if
you look at economics,",00:08:30.840,00:08:33.750
"you might want to assume
that the demand is",00:08:33.750,00:08:35.909
a linear function of the price.,00:08:35.909,00:08:38.039
"So if your price
is zero, there's",00:08:38.039,00:08:40.200
going to be a certain demand.,00:08:40.200,00:08:41.640
"And as the price increases,
the demand is going to move.",00:08:41.640,00:08:45.037
"Do you think b is going to
be positive or negative here?",00:08:45.037,00:08:47.370
What?,00:08:51.000,00:08:52.069
"Typically, it's
negative unless we're",00:08:52.069,00:08:53.610
"talking about
maybe luxury goods,",00:08:53.610,00:08:56.292
"where you know,
the more expensive,",00:08:56.292,00:08:57.750
"the more people
actually want it.",00:08:57.750,00:09:00.130
"I mean, if we're talking
about actual economic demand,",00:09:00.130,00:09:02.380
"that's probably
definitely negative.",00:09:02.380,00:09:06.030
"It doesn't have to be,
you know, clearly linear,",00:09:06.030,00:09:11.360
"so that you can actually
make it linear, transform it",00:09:11.360,00:09:13.724
into something linear.,00:09:13.724,00:09:14.640
"So for example, you have
this like multiplicative",00:09:14.640,00:09:17.520
"relationship, PV equals nRT,
which is the Ideal gas law.",00:09:17.520,00:09:24.330
"If you want to actually
write this relationship,",00:09:24.330,00:09:26.670
"if you want to predict
what the pressure is",00:09:26.670,00:09:28.680
"going to be as a function of
the volume and the temperature--",00:09:28.680,00:09:33.690
"and well, let's assume that
n is the Avogadro constant,",00:09:33.690,00:09:37.810
"and let's assume that the
radius is actually fixed.",00:09:37.810,00:09:42.060
"Then you take the log on each
side, so you get PV equals nRT.",00:09:42.060,00:09:47.840
"So what that means is that
log PV is equal to log nRT.",00:10:03.610,00:10:07.690
"So that means log P plus log V
is equal to the log nR plus log",00:10:10.600,00:10:23.180
"T. So we said that R is
constant, so this is actually",00:10:23.180,00:10:28.737
your constant.,00:10:28.737,00:10:29.320
I'm going to call it a.,00:10:29.320,00:10:31.400
"And then that
means that log P is",00:10:31.400,00:10:35.410
"equal to minus log V. That
log P is equal to a minus log",00:10:35.410,00:10:49.430
V plus log T. OK?,00:10:49.430,00:10:55.070
"And so in particular, if I
write b equal to negative 1",00:10:55.070,00:11:01.650
"and c equal to plus 1,
this gives me the formula",00:11:01.650,00:11:04.800
that I have here.,00:11:04.800,00:11:06.210
"Now again, it might be the case
that this is the ideal gas law.",00:11:06.210,00:11:10.670
"So in practice, if I
start recording pressure,",00:11:10.670,00:11:12.960
"and temperature, and volume, I
might make measurement errors,",00:11:12.960,00:11:16.830
"there might be slightly
different conditions",00:11:16.830,00:11:18.950
"in such a way that I'm not
going to get exactly those.",00:11:18.950,00:11:21.346
"And I'm just going to
put this little twiddle",00:11:21.346,00:11:23.220
"to account for the fact
that the points that I'm",00:11:23.220,00:11:25.350
"going to be recording
for log pressure,",00:11:25.350,00:11:28.170
"log volume, and log
temperature are not going",00:11:28.170,00:11:30.180
to be exactly on one line.,00:11:30.180,00:11:32.590
"OK, they're going to be close.",00:11:32.590,00:11:33.840
"Actually, in those
physics experiments,",00:11:33.840,00:11:36.150
"usually, they're very close
because the conditions",00:11:36.150,00:11:39.600
"are controlled under
lab experiments.",00:11:39.600,00:11:41.740
"So it means that the
noise is very small.",00:11:41.740,00:11:44.670
"But for other cases,
like demand and prices,",00:11:44.670,00:11:47.160
"it's not a law of physics,
and so this must change.",00:11:47.160,00:11:50.820
"Even the linear structure is
probably not clear, right.",00:11:50.820,00:11:53.180
"At some points,
there's probably going",00:11:53.180,00:11:54.763
"to be some weird
curvature happening.",00:11:54.763,00:11:57.550
"All right, so this slide is
just to tell you maybe you",00:11:57.550,00:12:00.910
"don't have, obviously,
a linear relationship,",00:12:00.910,00:12:03.071
"but maybe you do
if you start taking",00:12:03.071,00:12:04.570
"logs exponentials, squares.",00:12:04.570,00:12:08.380
"You can sometimes take the
product of two variables,",00:12:08.380,00:12:10.820
"things like this, right.",00:12:10.820,00:12:12.040
"So this is variable
transformation,",00:12:12.040,00:12:13.570
"and it's mostly
domain-specific, so we're not",00:12:13.570,00:12:15.610
"going to go into
more details of this.",00:12:15.610,00:12:18.076
Any questions?,00:12:18.076,00:12:19.480
"All right, so now I'm
going to be giving--",00:12:22.290,00:12:27.100
"so if we start thinking
a little more about what",00:12:27.100,00:12:29.100
"these coefficients
should be, well,",00:12:29.100,00:12:32.100
"remember-- so
everybody's clear why",00:12:32.100,00:12:34.440
I don't put the little i here?,00:12:34.440,00:12:36.280
"Right, I don't put the
little i because I'm just",00:12:41.971,00:12:43.970
"talking about a generic
x and a generic y,",00:12:43.970,00:12:47.120
"but the observations
are x1, y1, right.",00:12:47.120,00:12:49.870
"So typically, on
the blackboard I'm",00:12:49.870,00:12:53.450
"often going to write only xy,
but the data really is x1,",00:12:53.450,00:13:02.980
"y1, all the way to xn, yn.",00:13:02.980,00:13:07.180
"So those are those points in
this two dimensional plot.",00:13:07.180,00:13:10.810
"But I think of those as being
independent copies of the pair",00:13:10.810,00:13:21.830
xy.,00:13:21.830,00:13:24.500
They have to have--,00:13:24.500,00:13:26.120
to contain their relationship.,00:13:26.120,00:13:27.420
"And so when I talk
about distribution",00:13:27.420,00:13:29.630
"of those random variables, I
talk about the distribution",00:13:29.630,00:13:32.420
"of xy, and that's the same.",00:13:32.420,00:13:34.240
"All right, so the first
thing you might want to ask",00:13:34.240,00:13:36.950
"is, well, if I have an
infinite amount of data,",00:13:36.950,00:13:41.790
"what can I hope to
get for a and b?",00:13:41.790,00:13:44.390
"If my simple size
goes to infinity,",00:13:44.390,00:13:46.350
"then I should actually
know exactly what",00:13:46.350,00:13:48.110
the distribution of xy is.,00:13:48.110,00:13:50.040
"And so there should
be an a and a b",00:13:50.040,00:13:52.670
"that captures this linear
relationship between y and x.",00:13:52.670,00:13:57.305
"And so in particular,
we're going",00:13:57.305,00:13:59.180
"to try to ask the population,
or theoretic, values of a and b,",00:13:59.180,00:14:02.709
"and you can see that
you can actually",00:14:02.709,00:14:04.250
compute them explicitly.,00:14:04.250,00:14:05.960
So let's just try to find how.,00:14:05.960,00:14:08.510
"So as I said, we have
a bunch of points",00:14:08.510,00:14:10.640
"on this line close
to a line, and I'm",00:14:10.640,00:14:16.460
trying to find the best fit.,00:14:16.460,00:14:20.520
"All right, so this
guy is not a good fit.",00:14:20.520,00:14:23.330
This guy is not a good fit.,00:14:23.330,00:14:24.960
"And we know that this guy
is a good fit somehow.",00:14:24.960,00:14:27.870
"So we need to mathematically
formulate the fact",00:14:27.870,00:14:30.680
"that this line here is
better than this line here",00:14:30.680,00:14:35.150
or better than this line here.,00:14:35.150,00:14:37.460
"So what we're trying to do
is to create a function that",00:14:37.460,00:14:41.030
"has values that are
smaller for this curve",00:14:41.030,00:14:43.580
and larger for these two curves.,00:14:43.580,00:14:45.590
"And the way we do it is
by measuring the fit,",00:14:45.590,00:14:47.630
"and the fit is essentially
the aggregate distance",00:14:47.630,00:14:51.740
of all the points to the curve.,00:14:51.740,00:14:55.310
"And there's many
ways I can measure",00:14:55.310,00:14:56.930
the distance to a curve.,00:14:56.930,00:14:58.550
"So if I want to find so--
let's just open a parenthesis.",00:14:58.550,00:15:01.730
"If I have a point
here-- so we're",00:15:01.730,00:15:03.290
"going to do it for
one point at a time.",00:15:03.290,00:15:05.250
"So if I have a point,
there's many ways",00:15:05.250,00:15:07.120
"I can measure its distance
to the curve, right?",00:15:07.120,00:15:09.530
I can measure it like that.,00:15:09.530,00:15:12.800
"That is one distance
to the curve.",00:15:12.800,00:15:14.690
"I can measure it like that by
having a right angle here that",00:15:14.690,00:15:19.280
is one distance to the curve.,00:15:19.280,00:15:20.840
Or I can measure it like that.,00:15:20.840,00:15:23.430
"That is another distance
to the curve, right.",00:15:23.430,00:15:27.490
"There's many ways
I can go for it.",00:15:27.490,00:15:29.650
"It turns out that
one is actually",00:15:29.650,00:15:31.030
"going to be fairly
convenient for us,",00:15:31.030,00:15:33.040
"and that's the one that says,
let's look at the square",00:15:33.040,00:15:36.910
of the value of x on the curve.,00:15:36.910,00:15:38.720
"So if this is the curve,
y is equal to a plus bx.",00:15:38.720,00:15:43.690
"Now, I'm going to think of
this point as a random point,",00:15:51.260,00:15:54.140
"capital X, capital
Y, so that means",00:15:54.140,00:15:57.050
"that it's going to be x1,
y1 or x2, y2, et cetera.",00:15:57.050,00:16:02.210
"Now, I want to
measure the distance.",00:16:02.210,00:16:04.250
"Can somebody tell me
which of the three--",00:16:04.250,00:16:06.390
"the first one, the second
one, or the third one--",00:16:06.390,00:16:08.870
"this formula, expectation of y
minus a minus bx squared is--",00:16:08.870,00:16:13.610
"which of the three
is it representing?",00:16:13.610,00:16:18.578
AUDIENCE: The second one.,00:16:18.578,00:16:20.020
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
The second one",00:16:20.020,00:16:21.395
where I have the right angle?,00:16:21.395,00:16:22.740
"OK, everybody agrees with this?",00:16:22.740,00:16:26.710
"Anybody wants to vote
for something else?",00:16:26.710,00:16:28.730
Yeah?,00:16:28.730,00:16:29.320
AUDIENCE: The third one?,00:16:29.320,00:16:30.320
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
The third one?",00:16:30.320,00:16:31.695
"Everybody agrees
with the third one?",00:16:31.695,00:16:34.520
"So by default, everybody's
on the first one?",00:16:34.520,00:16:38.975
"Yeah, it is the vertical
distance actually.",00:16:38.975,00:16:42.010
"And the reason is if it was the
one with the straight angle,",00:16:42.010,00:16:44.555
"with the right angle,
it would actually",00:16:44.555,00:16:46.180
"be a very complicated
mathematical formula,",00:16:46.180,00:16:48.430
"so let's just see y, right?",00:16:48.430,00:16:51.240
"And by y, I mean y.",00:16:51.240,00:16:53.470
"OK, so this means that this
is my x, and this is my y.",00:16:53.470,00:16:59.460
"All right, so that means
that this point is xy.",00:17:02.500,00:17:05.829
"So what I'm measuring
is the difference",00:17:05.829,00:17:07.900
"between y minus
a plus b times x.",00:17:07.900,00:17:15.965
"This is the thing I'm going
to take the expectation off--",00:17:15.965,00:17:18.339
"the square and then
the expectation-- so a",00:17:18.339,00:17:20.290
"plus b times x, if this is
this line, this is this point.",00:17:20.290,00:17:24.140
So that's this value here.,00:17:24.140,00:17:27.310
"This value here is
a plus bx, right?",00:17:27.310,00:17:33.254
"So what I'm really
measuring is the difference",00:17:33.254,00:17:35.170
"between y and N plus bx,
which is this distance here.",00:17:35.170,00:17:38.740
"And since I like things
like Pythagoras theorem,",00:17:42.400,00:17:45.846
"I'm actually going
to put a square here",00:17:45.846,00:17:47.470
before I take the expectation.,00:17:47.470,00:17:51.500
"So now this is a
random variable.",00:17:51.500,00:17:53.090
This is this random variable.,00:17:53.090,00:17:55.210
"And so I want a number,
so I'm going to turn it",00:17:55.210,00:17:58.420
into a deterministic number.,00:17:58.420,00:18:00.020
"And the way I do this is
by taking expectation.",00:18:00.020,00:18:03.400
"And if you think expectations
should be close to average,",00:18:03.400,00:18:07.330
"this is the same
thing as saying,",00:18:07.330,00:18:09.310
"I want that in
average, the y's are",00:18:09.310,00:18:12.010
"close to the a plus bx, right?",00:18:12.010,00:18:14.440
"So we're doing it
in expectation,",00:18:14.440,00:18:16.570
"but that's going to
translate into doing it",00:18:16.570,00:18:18.370
in average for all the points.,00:18:18.370,00:18:20.650
"All right, so this is the
thing I want to measure.",00:18:20.650,00:18:22.850
"So that's this
vertical distance.",00:18:22.850,00:18:24.500
Yeah?,00:18:24.500,00:18:26.321
OK.,00:18:26.321,00:18:26.820
This is my fault actually.,00:18:32.750,00:18:36.292
"Maybe we should
close those shades.",00:18:36.292,00:18:37.890
"OK, I cannot do just
one at a time, sorry.",00:18:50.230,00:18:53.280
"All right, so now that I do
those vertical distances,",00:19:11.910,00:19:15.640
"I can ask-- well, now,
I have this function,",00:19:15.640,00:19:18.340
"right-- to have a function that
takes two parameters a and b,",00:19:18.340,00:19:22.020
"maps it to the expectation
of y minus a plus bx squared.",00:19:22.020,00:19:30.220
"Sorry, the square is here.",00:19:30.220,00:19:32.170
"And I could ask, well,
this is a function that",00:19:32.170,00:19:35.080
"measures the fit of the
parameters a and b, right?",00:19:35.080,00:19:38.320
This function should be small.,00:19:38.320,00:19:40.210
"The value of this
function here, function",00:19:40.210,00:19:45.700
"of a and b that measures
how close the point xy is",00:19:45.700,00:20:07.370
"to the line a plus
b times x while y",00:20:07.370,00:20:14.210
"is equal to a plus b
times x in expectation.",00:20:14.210,00:20:18.869
"OK, agreed?",00:20:23.760,00:20:24.400
This is what we just said.,00:20:24.400,00:20:27.030
"Again, if you're not
comfortable with the reason why",00:20:27.030,00:20:29.480
"you get expectations, just
think about having data points",00:20:29.480,00:20:32.290
"and taking the average
value for this guy.",00:20:32.290,00:20:34.410
"So it's basically an
aggregate distance",00:20:34.410,00:20:36.360
of the points to their line.,00:20:36.360,00:20:41.070
"OK, everybody agrees this
is a legitimate measure?",00:20:41.070,00:20:44.390
"If all my points were on the
line-- if my distribution--",00:20:44.390,00:20:48.150
"if y was actually equal
to a plus bx for some a",00:20:48.150,00:20:51.720
"and b then this function
would be equal to 0",00:20:51.720,00:20:54.780
"for the correct a and b, right?",00:20:54.780,00:20:57.906
"If they are far--
well, it's going",00:20:57.906,00:20:59.510
"to depend on how much
noise I'm getting,",00:20:59.510,00:21:01.460
"but it's still going to be
minimized for the best one.",00:21:01.460,00:21:04.190
So let's minimize this thing.,00:21:04.190,00:21:06.800
"So here, I don't make any--",00:21:06.800,00:21:11.000
"again, sorry.",00:21:11.000,00:21:12.350
"I don't make an assumption on
the distribution of x or y.",00:21:12.350,00:21:21.800
"Here, I assume, somehow,
that the variance of x",00:21:21.800,00:21:27.290
is not equal to 0.,00:21:27.290,00:21:28.289
Can somebody tell me why?,00:21:28.289,00:21:29.330
Yeah?,00:21:29.330,00:21:30.310
"AUDIENCE: Not really a
question-- the slides,",00:21:30.310,00:21:33.250
"you have y minus a minus bx
quantity squared expectation",00:21:33.250,00:21:38.150
"of that, and here you've written
square of the expectation.",00:21:38.150,00:21:41.204
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
No, here I'm actually",00:21:41.204,00:21:42.870

of the square.",00:21:42.870,00:21:46.890
"If I wanted to write the
square of the expectation,",00:21:46.890,00:21:49.200
I would just do this.,00:21:49.200,00:21:52.350
So let's just make it clear.,00:21:52.350,00:21:53.680
Right?,00:22:00.970,00:22:01.575
"Do you want me to put an
extra set of parenthesis?",00:22:01.575,00:22:03.820

confusing with the [INAUDIBLE]",00:22:06.690,00:22:11.034

AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:22:14.700,00:22:15.680
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Oh, the
expectation of the square,",00:22:15.680,00:22:17.180
sorry.,00:22:17.180,00:22:17.680
"Yeah, dyslexia.",00:22:20.310,00:22:22.130
"All right, any question?",00:22:22.130,00:22:25.100
Yeah?,00:22:25.100,00:22:25.600
"AUDIENCE: Does this assume
that the error is Gaussian?",00:22:25.600,00:22:28.400
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: No.,00:22:28.400,00:22:29.316
"AUDIENCE: I mean, in
the sense that like,",00:22:32.290,00:22:34.133
"if we knew that the
error was, like,",00:22:34.133,00:22:36.980
"even the minus followed
like-- so even the minus x",00:22:36.980,00:22:40.062
"to the fourth distribution,
would we want to minimise",00:22:40.062,00:22:44.942
"the expectation of what
the fourth power of y minus",00:22:44.942,00:22:48.358
"a equals bx in order to get
[? what the ?] [? best is? ?]",00:22:48.358,00:22:52.280
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Why?,00:22:52.280,00:22:53.238
"So you know the answers
to your question,",00:22:57.372,00:22:59.080
"so I just want you to
use the words that--",00:22:59.080,00:23:01.760
"right, so why would you want
to use the fourth power?",00:23:01.760,00:23:04.756
"AUDIENCE: Well,
because, like, we",00:23:04.756,00:23:06.429
"want to more strongly
penalize deviations",00:23:06.429,00:23:08.137
"because we'd expect very
large deviations to be",00:23:08.137,00:23:11.518
"very rare, or more
rare, than it would",00:23:11.518,00:23:15.870
"with the Gaussian
[INAUDIBLE] power.",00:23:15.870,00:23:18.170
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah so,
that would be the maximum likely",00:23:18.170,00:23:19.360
"estimator that you're
describing to me, right?",00:23:19.360,00:23:21.290
"I can actually
write the likelihood",00:23:21.290,00:23:22.850
of a pair of numbers ab.,00:23:22.850,00:23:25.340
"And if I know this,
that's actually",00:23:25.340,00:23:26.847
"what's going to come
into it because I",00:23:26.847,00:23:28.430
"know that the density is
going to come into play when",00:23:28.430,00:23:31.610
I talk about there.,00:23:31.610,00:23:32.740
"But here, I'm just
talking about--",00:23:32.740,00:23:34.580
this is a mechanical tool.,00:23:34.580,00:23:36.350
"I'm just saying, let's minimize
the distance to the curve.",00:23:36.350,00:23:39.640
"Another thing I could have
done is take the absolute value",00:23:39.640,00:23:42.320
"of this thing, for example.",00:23:42.320,00:23:43.750
"I just decided to take the
square root before I did it.",00:23:43.750,00:23:46.190
"OK, so regardless
of what I'm doing,",00:23:46.190,00:23:48.630
"I'm just taking the
squares because that's just",00:23:48.630,00:23:50.600
"going to be convenient for me
to do my computations for now.",00:23:50.600,00:23:53.600
"But we don't have
any statistical model",00:23:53.600,00:23:55.400
at this point.,00:23:55.400,00:23:56.940
"I didn't say anything--
that y follows this.",00:23:56.940,00:23:59.040
X follows this.,00:23:59.040,00:24:00.320
"I'm just doing
minimal assumptions",00:24:00.320,00:24:01.760
"as we go, all right?",00:24:01.760,00:24:04.250
"So the variance of
x is not equal to 0?",00:24:04.250,00:24:06.140
Could somebody tell me why?,00:24:06.140,00:24:07.270
"What would my cloud point
look like if the variance of x",00:24:11.330,00:24:14.490
was equal to 0?,00:24:14.490,00:24:16.130
"Yeah, they would all
be at the same point.",00:24:16.130,00:24:18.122
"So it's going to be hard for
me to start fitting in a line,",00:24:18.122,00:24:20.580
right?,00:24:20.580,00:24:21.180
"I mean, best case
scenario, I have this x.",00:24:21.180,00:24:24.100
"It has variance, zero, so
this is the expectation of x.",00:24:24.100,00:24:26.700
"And all my points have
the same expectation,",00:24:26.700,00:24:31.020
"and so, yes, I could
probably fit that line.",00:24:31.020,00:24:33.780
"But that wouldn't help
very much for other x's.",00:24:33.780,00:24:38.340
"So I need a bit of variance
so that things spread out",00:24:38.340,00:24:41.400
a little bit.,00:24:41.400,00:24:42.010
"OK, I'm going to
have to do this.",00:24:47.440,00:24:51.130
I think it's just my--,00:24:51.130,00:24:52.370
"All right, so I'm going to
put a little bit of variance.",00:25:10.200,00:25:13.460
"And the other thing is here,
I don't want to do much more,",00:25:13.460,00:25:15.960
"but I'm actually going to think
of x as having means zero.",00:25:15.960,00:25:22.440
"And the way I do
this is as follows.",00:25:22.440,00:25:24.430
"Let's define x tilde, which is
x minus the expectation of x.",00:25:24.430,00:25:30.570
"OK, so definitely the
expectation of x tilde is what?",00:25:30.570,00:25:33.920
"Zero, OK.",00:25:36.620,00:25:38.110
"And so now I want to
minimize in ab, expectation",00:25:38.110,00:25:43.350
"of y minus a plus b, x squared.",00:25:43.350,00:25:53.920
"And the way I'm going to do this
is by turning x into x tilde",00:25:53.920,00:26:03.810
and stuffing the extra--,00:26:03.810,00:26:07.060
"and putting the extra
expectation of x into the a.",00:26:07.060,00:26:12.760
"So I'm going to write this as
an expectation of y minus a plus",00:26:12.760,00:26:19.840
b expectation of x--,00:26:19.840,00:26:25.180
which I'm going to a tilde--,00:26:25.180,00:26:27.530
and plus b x tilde.,00:26:27.530,00:26:30.300
OK?,00:26:33.930,00:26:35.630
And everybody agrees with this?,00:26:35.630,00:26:38.920
"So now I have two
parameters, a tilde and b,",00:26:38.920,00:26:41.490
"and I'm going to pretend
that now x tilde--",00:26:41.490,00:26:44.350
"so now the role of x is played
by x tilde, which is now",00:26:44.350,00:26:50.830
a centered random variable.,00:26:50.830,00:26:53.020
"OK, so I'm going to
call this guy a tilde,",00:26:53.020,00:26:55.660
"but for my computations
I'm going to call it a.",00:26:55.660,00:26:58.859
"So how do I find the
minimum of this thing?",00:26:58.859,00:27:00.650
"Derivative equal to zero, right?",00:27:05.114,00:27:06.620
So here it's a quadratic thing.,00:27:06.620,00:27:08.235
It's going to be like that.,00:27:08.235,00:27:09.360
"I take the derivative,
set it to zero.",00:27:09.360,00:27:10.880
"So I'm first going to take
the derivative with respect",00:27:10.880,00:27:13.130
"to a and set it equal to zero,
so that's equivalent to saying",00:27:13.130,00:27:16.370
that the expectation of--,00:27:16.370,00:27:18.320
"well, here, I'm going
to pick up a 2--",00:27:18.320,00:27:21.315
"y minus a plus bx
tilde is equal to zero.",00:27:21.315,00:27:33.720
"And then I also have that the
derivative with respect to b is",00:27:33.720,00:27:36.580
"equal to zero, which is
equivalent to the expectation",00:27:36.580,00:27:40.260
"of-- well, I have a
negative sign somewhere,",00:27:40.260,00:27:42.100
so let me put it here--,00:27:42.100,00:27:43.410
"minus 2x tilde, y
minus a plus bx tilde.",00:27:43.410,00:27:50.950
"OK, see that's why I don't want
to put too many parenthesis.",00:27:55.644,00:27:58.910
OK.,00:28:03.140,00:28:05.741
"So I just took the
derivative with respect",00:28:05.741,00:28:07.490
"to a, which is just
basically the square,",00:28:07.490,00:28:09.920
"and then I have a negative 1
that comes out from inside.",00:28:09.920,00:28:12.569
"And then I take the
derivative with respect",00:28:12.569,00:28:14.360
"to b, and since b has x tilde.",00:28:14.360,00:28:17.010
"In [? factor, ?] it
comes out as well.",00:28:17.010,00:28:19.340
"All right, so the minus 2's
really won't matter for me.",00:28:19.340,00:28:24.420
And so now I have two equations.,00:28:24.420,00:28:26.706
"The first equation,
while it's pretty simple,",00:28:26.706,00:28:28.580
"it's just telling me that
the expectation of y minus a",00:28:28.580,00:28:31.955
is equal to zero.,00:28:31.955,00:28:33.710
"So what I know is that a is
equal to the expectation of y.",00:28:33.710,00:28:41.870
"And really that
was a tilde, which",00:28:41.870,00:28:44.060
"implies that the a
I want is actually",00:28:44.060,00:28:47.870
"equal to the
expectation of y minus b",00:28:47.870,00:29:00.690
times the expectation of x.,00:29:00.690,00:29:05.030
OK?,00:29:05.030,00:29:05.530
"Just because a tilde is a plus
b times the expectation of x.",00:29:10.240,00:29:13.450
So that's for my a.,00:29:16.830,00:29:19.360
"And then for my b, I
use the second one.",00:29:19.360,00:29:22.180
"So the second one tells me that
the expectation of x tilde of y",00:29:22.180,00:29:27.990
"is equal to a plus b times
the expectation of x tilde",00:29:27.990,00:29:32.430
"which is zero, right?",00:29:32.430,00:29:33.520
OK?,00:29:38.640,00:29:39.460
"But this a is actually
a tilde in this problem,",00:29:39.460,00:29:41.630
"so it's actually a plus
b expectation of x.",00:29:41.630,00:29:47.210
"Now, this is the
expectation of the product",00:29:51.900,00:29:53.890
"of two random variables, but
x tilde is centered, right?",00:29:53.890,00:29:57.480
"It's x minus expectation of
x, so this thing is actually",00:29:57.480,00:30:00.670
"equal to the covariance
between x and y",00:30:00.670,00:30:03.640
by definition of covariance.,00:30:03.640,00:30:05.140
"So now I have everything
I need, right.",00:30:09.130,00:30:11.840
How do I just--,00:30:11.840,00:30:14.110
I'm sorry about that.,00:30:14.110,00:30:16.520
So I have everything I need.,00:30:16.520,00:30:18.330
"Now, I now have two
equations with two unknowns,",00:30:18.330,00:30:22.560
"and all I have to do is
to basically plug it in.",00:30:22.560,00:30:25.110
"So it's essentially telling
me that the covariance of xy--",00:30:25.110,00:30:29.460
"so the first equation tells
me that the covariance of xy",00:30:29.460,00:30:31.980
"is equal to a plus b expectation
of x, but a is expectation of y",00:30:31.980,00:30:36.750
minus b expectation of x.,00:30:36.750,00:30:39.640
"So it's-- well, actually,
maybe I should start with b.",00:30:39.640,00:30:45.113
"Oh, sorry.",00:30:54.780,00:30:56.010
"OK, I forgot one thing.",00:30:56.010,00:30:59.580
"This is not true, right.",00:30:59.580,00:31:00.750
I forgot this term.,00:31:00.750,00:31:02.516
"x tilde multiplies x
tilde here, so what",00:31:02.516,00:31:05.850
I'm left with is x tilde--,00:31:05.850,00:31:07.680
"it's minus b times the
expectation of x tilde squared.",00:31:07.680,00:31:11.320
"So that's actually minus
b times the variance of x",00:31:11.320,00:31:14.800
"tilde because x tilde
is already centered,",00:31:14.800,00:31:17.970
"which is actually
the variance of x.",00:31:17.970,00:31:19.760
"So now I have that this thing
is actually a plus b expectation",00:31:23.850,00:31:29.790
of x minus b variance of x.,00:31:29.790,00:31:36.570
"And I also have that a
is equal to expectation",00:31:36.570,00:31:42.180
of y minus b expectation of x.,00:31:42.180,00:31:45.960
"So if I sum the two, those
guys are going to cancel.",00:31:53.720,00:31:58.100
Those guys are going to cancel.,00:31:58.100,00:32:00.740
"And so what I'm going to be
left with is covariance of xy",00:32:00.740,00:32:05.630
"is equal to expectation
of x, expectation of y,",00:32:05.630,00:32:10.570
"and then I'm left with
this term here, minus",00:32:10.570,00:32:12.610
b times the variance of x.,00:32:12.610,00:32:14.050
And so that tells me that b--,00:32:17.070,00:32:20.171
"why do I still have
the variance there?",00:32:20.171,00:32:21.796
"AUDIENCE: So is the
covariance really",00:32:34.692,00:32:37.668
"the expectation of x tilde
times y minus expectation of y?",00:32:37.668,00:32:43.124
"Because y is not
centered, correct?",00:32:43.124,00:32:46.092
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.,00:32:46.092,00:32:47.092
"AUDIENCE: OK, but x
is still the center.",00:32:47.092,00:32:48.814
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: But x
is still the center, right.",00:32:48.814,00:32:50.980
"So you just need
to have one that's",00:32:50.980,00:32:52.700
centered for this to work.,00:32:52.700,00:32:53.830
"Right, I mean, you can check it.",00:32:57.187,00:32:58.520
"But basically when
you're going to have",00:32:58.520,00:33:00.144
"the product of the expectations,
you only need one of the two",00:33:00.144,00:33:02.877
in the product to be zero.,00:33:02.877,00:33:03.960
So the product is zero.,00:33:03.960,00:33:04.920
"OK, why do I keep my--",00:33:09.090,00:33:11.020
"so I get a, a, and
then the b expectation.",00:33:11.020,00:33:14.542
"OK, so that's probably
earlier that I made a mistake.",00:33:14.542,00:33:16.750
So I get-- so this was a tilde.,00:33:25.620,00:33:29.140
Let's just be clear about the--,00:33:29.140,00:33:30.548
So that tells me that a tilde--,00:33:40.508,00:33:43.350
"maybe it's not super
fair of me to--",00:33:43.350,00:33:45.570
"yeah, OK, I think I know
where I made a mistake.",00:33:48.310,00:33:50.426
I should not have centered.,00:33:50.426,00:33:51.550
"I wanted to make my life
easier, and I should not",00:33:51.550,00:33:54.760
have done that.,00:33:54.760,00:33:55.960
"And the reason is a
tilde depends on b,",00:33:55.960,00:33:59.140
"so when I take the
derivative with respect",00:33:59.140,00:34:01.780
"to b, what I'm left with here--",00:34:01.780,00:34:04.840
"since a tilde
depends on b, when I",00:34:04.840,00:34:06.880
"take the derivative of
this guy, I actually",00:34:06.880,00:34:09.370
"don't get a tilde here,
but I really get--",00:34:09.370,00:34:12.550
"so again, this was not--",00:34:17.570,00:34:20.896
so that's the first one.,00:34:20.896,00:34:21.960
This is actually x here--,00:34:30.389,00:34:33.800
"because when I take the
derivative with respect to b.",00:34:33.800,00:34:38.050
"And so now, what I'm left with
is that the expectation-- so",00:34:38.050,00:34:40.929
"yeah, I'm basically left
with nothing that helps.",00:34:40.929,00:34:43.929
So I'm sorry about.,00:34:43.929,00:34:46.300
"Let's start from the
beginning because this is not",00:34:46.300,00:34:49.929
"getting us anywhere, and a
fix is not going to help.",00:34:49.929,00:34:53.090
So let's just do it again.,00:34:53.090,00:34:55.370
Sorry about that.,00:34:55.370,00:34:56.320
"So let's not center anything
and just do brute force",00:34:56.320,00:34:59.230
because we're going to--,00:34:59.230,00:35:01.120
b x squared.,00:35:01.120,00:35:04.820
All right.,00:35:04.820,00:35:07.270
"Partial, with respect
to a, is giving",00:35:07.270,00:35:09.520
"equal zero is
equivalent, so my minus 2",00:35:09.520,00:35:11.920
"is going to cancel, right.",00:35:11.920,00:35:13.060
"So I'm going to actually
forget about this.",00:35:13.060,00:35:14.851
"So it's actually telling
me that the expectation",00:35:14.851,00:35:17.980
"of y minus a plus bx
is equal to zero, which",00:35:17.980,00:35:25.660
"is equivalent to a plus
b expectation of x, is",00:35:25.660,00:35:31.090
equal to the expectation of y.,00:35:31.090,00:35:33.775
"Now, if I take the
derivative with respect to",00:35:33.775,00:35:35.650
"b and set it equal to
zero, this is telling me",00:35:35.650,00:35:38.830
that the expectation of--,00:35:38.830,00:35:41.656
"well, it's the same thing
except that this time I'm",00:35:41.656,00:35:43.780
going to pull out an x.,00:35:43.780,00:35:45.280
This guy is equal to zero--,00:35:52.470,00:35:54.310
this guy is not here--,00:35:54.310,00:35:56.660
"and so that implies that
the expectation of xy",00:35:56.660,00:36:03.650
"is equal to a times
the expectation of x,",00:36:03.650,00:36:09.560
"plus b times the
expectation of x square.",00:36:09.560,00:36:16.726
OK?,00:36:16.726,00:36:17.226
"All right, so the first one is
actually not giving me much,",00:36:21.540,00:36:26.720
"so I need to actually work
with the two of those guys.",00:36:26.720,00:36:29.700
So I'm going to take the first--,00:36:29.700,00:36:31.470
"so let me rewrite those two
inequalities that I have.",00:36:31.470,00:36:33.690
"I have a plus b, e of
x is equal to e of y.",00:36:33.690,00:36:40.830
And then I have e of xy.,00:36:40.830,00:36:43.092
"OK, and now what I do is
that I multiply this guy.",00:36:50.970,00:37:01.160
"So I want to cancel one
of those things, right?",00:37:01.160,00:37:03.230
So what I'm going to--,00:37:03.230,00:37:04.455
"so I'm going to take
this guy, and I'm",00:37:12.197,00:37:13.780
"going to multiply it by e of
x and take the difference.",00:37:13.780,00:37:19.030
"So I do times e of x, and then
I take the sum of those two,",00:37:19.030,00:37:26.330
"and then those two terms
are going to cancel.",00:37:26.330,00:37:28.840
"So then that tells
me that b times e",00:37:28.840,00:37:33.550
"of x squared, plus the
expectation of xy is equal to--",00:37:33.550,00:37:45.180
"so this guy is the
one that cancelled.",00:37:45.180,00:37:48.423
"Then I get this guy
here, expectation",00:37:53.850,00:37:56.570
"of x times the expectation
of y, plus the guy that",00:37:56.570,00:38:02.450
remains here--,00:38:02.450,00:38:04.070
"which is b times the
expectation of x square.",00:38:04.070,00:38:08.752
"So here I have b expectation
of x, the whole thing squared.",00:38:11.920,00:38:16.220
"And here I have b
expectation of x square.",00:38:16.220,00:38:18.400
"So if I pull this guy
here, what do I get?",00:38:18.400,00:38:22.440
"b times the variance of x, OK?",00:38:22.440,00:38:26.140
So I'm going to move here.,00:38:26.140,00:38:28.180
"And this guy here, when
I move this guy here,",00:38:28.180,00:38:31.160
"I get the expectation
of x times y,",00:38:31.160,00:38:32.980
"minus the expectation of x
times the expectation of y.",00:38:32.980,00:38:35.590
"So this is actually telling me
that the covariance of x and y",00:38:35.590,00:38:40.540
"is equal to b times
the variance of x.",00:38:40.540,00:38:45.450
"And so then that
tells me that b is",00:38:45.450,00:38:48.840
"equal to covariance of xy
divided by the variance of x.",00:38:48.840,00:38:55.519
"And that's why I actually
need the variance",00:38:55.519,00:38:57.310
"of x to be non-zero because
I couldn't do that otherwise.",00:38:57.310,00:39:01.690
"And because if it
was, it would mean",00:39:01.690,00:39:03.190
"that b should be
plus infinity, which",00:39:03.190,00:39:04.890
"is what the limit of this
guy is when the variance goes",00:39:04.890,00:39:08.220
to zero or negative infinity.,00:39:08.220,00:39:11.200
I can not sort them out.,00:39:11.200,00:39:14.410
"All right, so I'm
sorry about the mess,",00:39:14.410,00:39:16.130
but that should be more clear.,00:39:16.130,00:39:19.070
"Then a, of course,
you can write it",00:39:19.070,00:39:21.410
"by plugging in the
value of b, so you",00:39:21.410,00:39:23.240
"know it's only a function
of your distribution, right?",00:39:23.240,00:39:27.030
"So what are the characteristics
of the distribution--",00:39:27.030,00:39:29.240
"so distribution can
have a bunch of things.",00:39:29.240,00:39:31.031
"It can have movements
of order 4, of order 26.",00:39:31.031,00:39:34.330
"It can have heavy
tails or light tails.",00:39:34.330,00:39:36.590
"But when you compute
least squares,",00:39:36.590,00:39:39.320
"the only thing that
matters are the variance",00:39:39.320,00:39:41.900
"of x, the expectation
of the individual ones--",00:39:41.900,00:39:45.320
"and really what captures how
y changes when you change x,",00:39:45.320,00:39:50.300
is captured in the covariance.,00:39:50.300,00:39:51.590
"The rest is really
just normalization.",00:39:51.590,00:39:54.510
"It's just telling you, I want
things to cross the y-axis",00:39:54.510,00:39:58.550
at the right place.,00:39:58.550,00:39:59.360
"I want things to cross the
x-axis at the right place.",00:39:59.360,00:40:02.330
"But the slope is really captured
by how much more covariance",00:40:02.330,00:40:05.720
"you have relative to
the variance of x.",00:40:05.720,00:40:08.330
"So this is essentially setting
the scale for the x-axis,",00:40:08.330,00:40:12.350
"and this is telling
you for a unit scale,",00:40:12.350,00:40:15.410
"this is the unit of y
that you're changing.",00:40:15.410,00:40:20.460
"OK, so we have explicit forms.",00:40:20.460,00:40:23.600
"And what I could do, if I
wanted to estimate those things,",00:40:23.600,00:40:26.300
"is just say, well again, we
have expectations, right?",00:40:26.300,00:40:32.510
"The expectation of xy minus the
product of the expectations,",00:40:32.510,00:40:36.050
"I could replace
expectations by averages",00:40:36.050,00:40:38.510
"and get an empirical
covariance just",00:40:38.510,00:40:40.310
"like we can replace the
expectations for the variance",00:40:40.310,00:40:42.710
and get a sample covariance.,00:40:42.710,00:40:44.720
"And this is basically what
we're going to be doing.",00:40:44.720,00:40:47.300
"All right, this is
essentially what you want.",00:40:47.300,00:40:49.470
"The problem is that if
you view it that way,",00:40:49.470,00:40:51.950
"you sort of prevent yourself
from being able to solve",00:40:51.950,00:40:54.860
the multivariate problem.,00:40:54.860,00:40:56.510
"Because it's only in
the univariate problem",00:40:56.510,00:40:58.430
"that you have closed form
solutions for your problem.",00:40:58.430,00:41:00.930
"But if you actually
go to multivariate,",00:41:00.930,00:41:03.080
"this is not where you want
to replace expectations",00:41:03.080,00:41:05.510
by averages.,00:41:05.510,00:41:06.230
"You actually want to replace
expectation by averages here.",00:41:06.230,00:41:09.120
"And once you do
it here, then you",00:41:12.520,00:41:14.950
"can actually just solve
the minimisation problem.",00:41:14.950,00:41:17.920
"OK, so one thing that
arises from this guy",00:41:23.240,00:41:29.840
"is that this is an
interesting formula.",00:41:29.840,00:41:35.795
"All right, think about it.",00:41:40.640,00:41:43.740
"If I have that y is a
plus bx plus some noise.",00:41:43.740,00:42:00.190
"Things are no
longer on something.",00:42:00.190,00:42:02.680
"I have that y is equal to
a bx plus some noise, which",00:42:02.680,00:42:08.470
is usually denoted by epsilon.,00:42:08.470,00:42:11.210
"So that's the
distribution, right?",00:42:11.210,00:42:12.910
"If I tell you the
distribution of x, and I",00:42:12.910,00:42:15.760
say y is a plus b epsilon--,00:42:15.760,00:42:17.470
"I tell you the
distribution of y,",00:42:17.470,00:42:18.940
"and if [? they mean ?] that
those two are independent,",00:42:18.940,00:42:21.190
you have a distribution on y.,00:42:21.190,00:42:23.860
"So what happens is that I can
actually always say-- well, you",00:42:23.860,00:42:27.364
"know, this is
equivalent to saying",00:42:27.364,00:42:28.780
"that epsilon is equal to
y minus a plus bx, right?",00:42:28.780,00:42:35.560
"I can always write
this as just--",00:42:35.560,00:42:37.540
"I mean, as tautology.",00:42:37.540,00:42:40.320
"But here, for those guys--",00:42:40.320,00:42:42.069
"this is not for any guy, right.",00:42:42.069,00:42:43.360
"This is really for
the best fit, a",00:42:43.360,00:42:45.770
"and b, those ones that
satisfy this gradient is",00:42:45.770,00:42:50.170
equal to zero thing.,00:42:50.170,00:42:51.610
"Then what we had is that
the expectation of epsilon",00:42:51.610,00:42:55.330
"was equal to expectation
of y minus a plus",00:42:55.330,00:42:59.380
"b expectation of x by linearity
of the expectation, which",00:42:59.380,00:43:03.430
was equal to zero.,00:43:03.430,00:43:05.560
"So for this best
fit we have zero.",00:43:05.560,00:43:10.180
"Now, the covariance
between x and y--",00:43:10.180,00:43:13.630
"Between, sorry, x
and epsilon, is what?",00:43:17.190,00:43:20.530
"Well, it's the
covariance between x--",00:43:20.530,00:43:23.420
"and well, epsilon was
y minus a plus bx.",00:43:23.420,00:43:27.540
"Now, the covariance is
bilinear, so what I have",00:43:30.100,00:43:33.240
"is that the
covariance of this is",00:43:33.240,00:43:35.640
the covariance of xn times y--,00:43:35.640,00:43:38.760
"sorry, of x and y, minus
the variance-- well,",00:43:38.760,00:43:41.790
"minus a plus b,
covariance of x and x,",00:43:41.790,00:43:50.220
which is the variance of x?,00:43:50.220,00:43:54.720
"Covariance of xy minus
a plus b variance of x.",00:43:59.050,00:44:03.510
"OK, I didn't write it.",00:44:12.384,00:44:13.300
"So here I have
covariance of xy is",00:44:13.300,00:44:16.080
"equal to b variance of x, right?",00:44:16.080,00:44:17.910
Covariance of xy.,00:44:34.070,00:44:35.270
"Yeah, that's because they cannot
do that with the covariance.",00:44:35.270,00:44:38.057
"Yeah, I have those
averages again.",00:44:44.030,00:44:46.520
"No, because this
is centered, right?",00:44:46.520,00:44:48.320
"Sorry, this is centered,
so this is actually",00:44:48.320,00:44:51.000
"equal to the expectation of
x times y minus a plus bx.",00:44:51.000,00:44:56.760
"The covariance is
equal to the product",00:45:01.527,00:45:03.110
"just because this insight
is actually centered.",00:45:03.110,00:45:05.750
"So this is the
expectation of x times y",00:45:05.750,00:45:09.980
"minus the expectation of a times
the expectation of x, plus b",00:45:09.980,00:45:20.100
"minus b times the
expectation of x squared.",00:45:20.100,00:45:23.013
"Well, actually maybe I
should not really go too far.",00:45:32.200,00:45:34.720
"So this is actually
the one that I need.",00:45:38.894,00:45:40.560
"But if I stop here, this is
actually equal to zero, right.",00:45:40.560,00:45:47.300
Those are the same equations.,00:45:47.300,00:45:49.095
OK?,00:45:52.065,00:45:53.050
Yeah?,00:45:53.050,00:45:53.550
"AUDIENCE: What are
we doing right now?",00:45:53.550,00:45:55.516
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
So we're just saying",00:45:55.516,00:45:57.140
"that if I actually believe that
this best fit was the one that",00:45:57.140,00:46:01.070
"gave me the right
parameters, what would",00:46:01.070,00:46:02.990
"that imply on the noise
itself, on this epsilon?",00:46:02.990,00:46:05.804
"So here we're
actually just trying",00:46:05.804,00:46:07.220
"to find some necessary condition
for the noise to hold--",00:46:07.220,00:46:10.070
for the noise.,00:46:10.070,00:46:11.030
"And so those conditions are,
that first, the expectation",00:46:11.030,00:46:14.540
is zero.,00:46:14.540,00:46:15.290
That's what we've got here.,00:46:15.290,00:46:17.090
"And then, that the covariance
between the noise and x",00:46:17.090,00:46:20.480
has to be zero as well.,00:46:20.480,00:46:22.900
"OK, so those are
actually conditions",00:46:22.900,00:46:24.770
that the noise must satisfy.,00:46:24.770,00:46:26.360
"But the noise was just not
really defined as noise itself.",00:46:26.360,00:46:29.450
"We were just
saying, OK, if we're",00:46:29.450,00:46:31.550
"going to put some assumptions
on the epsilon, what",00:46:31.550,00:46:35.230
do we better have?,00:46:35.230,00:46:36.110
"So the first one is that
it's centered, which is good,",00:46:36.110,00:46:38.360
"because otherwise, the noise
would shift everything.",00:46:38.360,00:46:41.150
"So now when you look at a
linear regression model--",00:46:41.150,00:46:45.620
"typically, if you open a book,
it doesn't start by saying,",00:46:45.620,00:46:48.590
"let the noise be the
difference between y",00:46:48.590,00:46:50.920
"and what I actually
want y to be.",00:46:50.920,00:46:52.940
"It says let y be a
plus bx plus epsilon.",00:46:52.940,00:46:57.210
"So conversely, if we assume that
this is the model that we have,",00:46:57.210,00:47:02.120
"then we're going to have
to assume that epsilon--",00:47:02.120,00:47:04.340
"we're going to assume
that epsilon is centered,",00:47:04.340,00:47:06.298
"and that the covariance
between x and epsilon is zero.",00:47:06.298,00:47:10.840
"Actually, often, we're
going to assume much more.",00:47:10.840,00:47:13.760
"And one way to ensure that
those two things are satisfied",00:47:13.760,00:47:17.600
"is to assume that x is
independent of epsilon,",00:47:17.600,00:47:19.940
for example.,00:47:19.940,00:47:21.290
"If you assume that x is
independent of epsilon,",00:47:21.290,00:47:23.940
"of course the covariance
is going to be zero.",00:47:23.940,00:47:28.332
"Or we might assume that
the conditional expectation",00:47:28.332,00:47:30.720
"of epsilon, given x, is equal
to zero, then that implies that.",00:47:30.720,00:47:35.450
"OK, now the fact that it's
centered is one thing.",00:47:35.450,00:47:38.710
"So if we make this assumption,
the only thing it's telling us",00:47:38.710,00:47:43.500
"is that those ab's that come--
right, we started from there.",00:47:43.500,00:47:47.700
"y is equal to a plus bx plus
some epsilon for some a,",00:47:47.700,00:47:51.240
for some b.,00:47:51.240,00:47:51.960
"What it turns out is that
those a's and b's are actually",00:47:51.960,00:47:55.890
"the ones that you would get
by solving this expectation",00:47:55.890,00:47:58.680

"All right, so when you asked--",00:48:00.690,00:48:02.610
back when you were following--,00:48:02.610,00:48:04.530
"so when you asked,
you know, why don't we",00:48:04.530,00:48:07.170
"take the square, for
example, or the power",00:48:07.170,00:48:10.290
"4, or something like this--",00:48:10.290,00:48:12.210
"then here, I'm saying, well, if
I have y is equal to a plus bx,",00:48:12.210,00:48:15.990
"I don't actually need to put
too much assumptions on epsilon.",00:48:15.990,00:48:19.230
"If epsilon is actually
satisfying those two things,",00:48:19.230,00:48:22.320
"expectation is equal to
zero and the covariance",00:48:22.320,00:48:25.620
"with x is equal to zero,
then the right a and b",00:48:25.620,00:48:28.912
"that I'm looking for are
actually the ones that",00:48:28.912,00:48:30.870
come with the square--,00:48:30.870,00:48:32.120
not with power 4 or power 25.,00:48:32.120,00:48:36.750
"So those are actually
pretty weak assumptions.",00:48:36.750,00:48:39.300
"If we want to do
inference, we're",00:48:39.300,00:48:41.510
"going to have to
assume slightly more.",00:48:41.510,00:48:43.350
"If we want to use
T-distributions at some point,",00:48:43.350,00:48:45.690
"for example, and we
will, we're going",00:48:45.690,00:48:47.520
"to have to assume that epsilon
has a Gaussian distribution.",00:48:47.520,00:48:50.800
"So if you want to start doing
more statistics beyond just",00:48:50.800,00:48:53.700
"like doing this least square
thing, which is minimizing",00:48:53.700,00:48:56.550
"the square of criterion,
you're actually",00:48:56.550,00:48:58.350
"going to have to put
more assumptions.",00:48:58.350,00:48:59.933
"But right now, we
did not need them.",00:48:59.933,00:49:01.710
"We only need that epsilon
as mean zero and covariant",00:49:01.710,00:49:04.210
zero with x.,00:49:04.210,00:49:04.998
"OK, so that was basically
probabilistic, right.",00:49:08.750,00:49:13.040
"If I were to do
probability and I",00:49:13.040,00:49:14.450
"were trying to model the
relationship between two",00:49:14.450,00:49:17.090
"random variables, x
and y, in the form",00:49:17.090,00:49:20.330
"y is a plus bx plus some noise,
this is what would come out.",00:49:20.330,00:49:24.320
Everything was expectations.,00:49:24.320,00:49:25.640
There was no data involved.,00:49:25.640,00:49:27.290
"So now let's go to the
data problem, which is now,",00:49:27.290,00:49:33.620
"I do not know what
those expectations are.",00:49:33.620,00:49:35.540
"In particular, I don't know what
the covariance of x and y is,",00:49:35.540,00:49:38.240
"and I don't know with
the expectation of x",00:49:38.240,00:49:40.610
and the expectation of y r.,00:49:40.610,00:49:42.950
So I have data to do that.,00:49:42.950,00:49:44.570
So how am I going to do this?,00:49:44.570,00:49:45.880
"Well, I'm just
going to say, well,",00:49:49.244,00:49:50.660
"if I want x1, y1,
xn, yn, and I'm going",00:49:50.660,00:49:57.570
"to assume that
they're [? iid. ?]",00:49:57.570,00:49:59.781
"And I'm actually going
to assume that they",00:49:59.781,00:50:01.530
"have some model, right.",00:50:01.530,00:50:02.820
"So I'm going to assume
that I have that a--",00:50:02.820,00:50:06.570
"so that Yi follows
the same model.",00:50:06.570,00:50:09.150
"So epsilon i
[? rad, ?] and I won't",00:50:14.620,00:50:17.000
"say that expectation of epsilon
i is zero and covariance of xi,",00:50:17.000,00:50:23.610
epsilon i is equal to zero.,00:50:23.610,00:50:25.630
"So I'm going to put the
same model on all the data.",00:50:25.630,00:50:28.880
"So you can see that a is
not ai, and b is not bi.",00:50:28.880,00:50:31.420
It's the same.,00:50:31.420,00:50:32.380
"So as my data
increases, I should",00:50:32.380,00:50:34.090
"be able to recover
the correct things--",00:50:34.090,00:50:36.850
"as the size of my
data increases.",00:50:36.850,00:50:39.430
"OK, so this is what the
statistical problem look like.",00:50:39.430,00:50:43.030
You're given the points.,00:50:43.030,00:50:45.250
"There is a true line
from which this point",00:50:45.250,00:50:47.350
"was generated, right.",00:50:47.350,00:50:48.557
There was this line.,00:50:48.557,00:50:49.390
"There was a true ab that
I use to draw this plot,",00:50:49.390,00:50:54.250
and that was the line.,00:50:54.250,00:50:55.190
"So first I picked an
x, say uniformly at",00:50:55.190,00:50:59.320
"on this intervals, 0 to 2.",00:50:59.320,00:51:02.110
I said that was this one.,00:51:02.110,00:51:03.610
"Then I said well, I
want y to be a plus bx,",00:51:03.610,00:51:06.800
"so it should be
here, but then I'm",00:51:06.800,00:51:08.500
"going to add some noise
epsilon to go away again",00:51:08.500,00:51:10.840
back from this line.,00:51:10.840,00:51:13.270

actually got two points correct",00:51:13.270,00:51:16.970
on this line.,00:51:16.970,00:51:18.070
"So there's basically
two epsilons",00:51:18.070,00:51:20.170
"that were small enough
that the dots actually",00:51:20.170,00:51:22.330

"Everybody's clear
about what I'm drawing?",00:51:24.720,00:51:27.060

you're a statistician,",00:51:27.060,00:51:28.810
you don't see this.,00:51:28.810,00:51:29.620

"And you have to
recover this guy,",00:51:30.810,00:51:32.610

look like this.",00:51:32.610,00:51:34.260

actually generated the data.,00:51:42.610,00:51:44.230

while this line corresponds",00:51:44.230,00:51:46.810
"to some parameters
a hat and b hat,",00:51:46.810,00:51:48.967

two lines-- how far those two",00:51:48.967,00:51:51.550
lines are?,00:51:51.550,00:51:52.060
"And one to address
this question is",00:51:52.060,00:51:53.620
"to say how far is a from a hat,
and how far is b from b hat?",00:51:53.620,00:51:57.920
OK?,00:51:57.920,00:51:58.785
"Another question, of
course, that you may ask",00:51:58.785,00:52:00.660
"is, how do you find
a hat and b hat?",00:52:00.660,00:52:04.470
"And as you can see, it's
basically the same thing.",00:52:04.470,00:52:07.530
"Remember, what was a-- so b
was the covariance between x",00:52:07.530,00:52:15.210
"and y divided by the
variance of x, right?",00:52:15.210,00:52:21.240
We check and rewrite this.,00:52:21.240,00:52:22.410

xy minus expectation",00:52:22.410,00:52:26.430

The whole thing's--,00:52:35.580,00:52:37.540
OK?,00:52:37.540,00:52:39.040
"If you look at the
expression for b hat,",00:52:39.040,00:52:42.910
"I basically replaced all
the expectations by bars.",00:52:42.910,00:52:47.670
"So I said, well,
this guy I'm going",00:52:47.670,00:52:49.800
to estimate by an average.,00:52:49.800,00:52:53.480
"So that's the xy
bar, and is 1 over n,",00:52:53.480,00:52:59.970
"[? sum ?] from [? i co ?]
1, to n of Xi, times Yi.",00:52:59.970,00:53:03.025
"x bar, of course, is just
the one that we're used to.",00:53:05.555,00:53:08.380
And same for y bar.,00:53:12.690,00:53:14.970
"X squared bar, the
one that's here,",00:53:14.970,00:53:20.580
is the average of the squares.,00:53:20.580,00:53:22.290
"And x bar square is the
square of the average.",00:53:22.290,00:53:24.426
"OK, so you just basically
replace this guy by x bar,",00:53:39.510,00:53:44.070
"this guy by y bar, this
guy by x square bar,",00:53:44.070,00:53:47.820
"and this guy by x
bar and no square.",00:53:47.820,00:53:52.350
"OK, so that's basically
one way to do it.",00:53:52.350,00:53:54.810
"Everywhere you see
an expectation,",00:53:54.810,00:53:56.340
you replace it by an average.,00:53:56.340,00:53:58.740
"That's the usual
statistical hammer.",00:53:58.740,00:54:02.070
"You can actually be slightly
more subtle about this.",00:54:02.070,00:54:04.720
"And as an exercise,
I invite you--",00:54:09.980,00:54:12.420
"just to make sure that you know
how to do this competition,",00:54:12.420,00:54:14.940

same kind of competitions",00:54:14.940,00:54:17.400
that we've done.,00:54:17.400,00:54:18.840
"But as an exercise,
you can check",00:54:18.840,00:54:20.670
"that if you actually
look at say, well,",00:54:20.670,00:54:23.311
"what I wanted to minimize here,
I had an expectation, right?",00:54:23.311,00:54:25.810
"And I said, let's
minimize this thing.",00:54:32.720,00:54:35.660
"Well, let's replace this
by an average first.",00:54:35.660,00:54:41.800
And now minimize.,00:54:51.630,00:54:54.270
"OK, so if I do
this, it turns out",00:54:54.270,00:54:57.100
"I'm going to actually
get the same result.",00:54:57.100,00:55:00.160
"The minimum of the
average is basically--",00:55:00.160,00:55:03.940
"when I replace the
average by-- sorry,",00:55:03.940,00:55:06.160
"when I replace the
expectation by the average",00:55:06.160,00:55:09.040
"and then minimize,
it's the same thing",00:55:09.040,00:55:11.817
"as first minimizing and
then replacing expectation",00:55:11.817,00:55:13.900
by averages in this case.,00:55:13.900,00:55:17.510
"Again, this is a much
more general principle",00:55:17.510,00:55:21.764
"because if you
don't have a closed",00:55:21.764,00:55:23.180
"form for the minimum like for
some, say, likelihood problems,",00:55:23.180,00:55:27.530
"well, you might not
actually have a possibility",00:55:27.530,00:55:30.579
"to just look at what the
formula looks like-- see where",00:55:30.579,00:55:32.870
"the expectations show up-- and
then just plug in the averages",00:55:32.870,00:55:35.480
instead.,00:55:35.480,00:55:36.380
"So this is the one you
want to keep in mind.",00:55:36.380,00:55:39.170
"And again, as an exercise.",00:55:39.170,00:55:41.000
"OK, so here, and then
you do expectation",00:55:47.000,00:55:48.870
replaced by averages.,00:55:48.870,00:55:52.980
"And then that's the same
answer, and I encourage",00:55:52.980,00:55:57.800
you to solve the exercise.,00:55:57.800,00:56:00.080

is actually the same expression",00:56:00.080,00:56:03.770

and we're hoping that,",00:58:23.787,00:58:25.620
"together, they can help
us do a better prediction.",00:58:25.620,00:58:29.460
"All right, so maybe I
don't have only the price,",00:58:29.460,00:58:31.890
"but maybe I have a bunch
of other social indicators.",00:58:31.890,00:58:35.670
"Maybe I know the competition,
the price of the competition.",00:58:35.670,00:58:40.484
"And maybe I know a
bunch of other things",00:58:40.484,00:58:42.150
that are actually relevant.,00:58:42.150,00:58:43.980
"And so I'm trying to find a way
to combine a bunch of points,",00:58:43.980,00:58:48.030
a bunch of measures.,00:58:48.030,00:58:50.880
"There's a nice
example that I like,",00:58:50.880,00:58:52.540
"which is people were
trying to measure something",00:58:52.540,00:58:56.370
"related to your body
mass index, so basically",00:58:56.370,00:59:00.750
"the volume of your-- the
density of your body.",00:59:00.750,00:59:04.820
"And the way you can do
this is by just, really,",00:59:04.820,00:59:07.380
"weighing someone and
also putting them",00:59:07.380,00:59:10.170
"in some cubic meter of water
and see how much overflows.",00:59:10.170,00:59:13.920
"And then you have
both the volume",00:59:13.920,00:59:15.750
"and the mass of
this person, and you",00:59:15.750,00:59:20.850
can start computing density.,00:59:20.850,00:59:23.370
"But as you can
imagine, you know,",00:59:23.370,00:59:25.860
"I would not personally
like to go to a gym",00:59:25.860,00:59:27.684
"when the first thing
they ask me is to just go",00:59:27.684,00:59:29.600
"in a bucket of
water, and so people",00:59:29.600,00:59:33.240
"try to find ways to measure this
based on other indicators that",00:59:33.240,00:59:36.840
are much easier to measure.,00:59:36.840,00:59:38.110
"For example, I don't know,
the length of my forearm,",00:59:38.110,00:59:41.040
"and the circumference of
my head, and maybe my belly",00:59:41.040,00:59:45.090
"would probably be
more appropriate here.",00:59:45.090,00:59:46.870
"And so you know, they
just try to find something",00:59:46.870,00:59:48.870
that actually makes sense.,00:59:48.870,00:59:50.340
"And so there's
actually a nice example",00:59:50.340,00:59:52.094
"where you can show
that if you measure--",00:59:52.094,00:59:53.760
"I think one of the
most significant",00:59:53.760,00:59:55.050
"was with the circumference
of your wrist.",00:59:55.050,00:59:56.860
"This is actually a very good
indicator of your body density.",00:59:56.860,01:00:02.070
"And it turns out that if you
stuff all the bunch of things",01:00:02.070,01:00:06.780
"together, you might actually
get a very good formula that",01:00:06.780,01:00:09.240
explains things.,01:00:09.240,01:00:10.840
"All right, so what
we're going to do",01:00:10.840,01:00:12.390
"is rather than saying
we have only one x",01:00:12.390,01:00:14.406
"to explain y's,
let's say we have",01:00:14.406,01:00:15.780
"20 x's that we're trying
to combine to explain y.",01:00:15.780,01:00:19.510
"And again, just like assuming
something of the form,",01:00:19.510,01:00:22.410
"y is a plus b times x was the
simplest thing we could do,",01:00:22.410,01:00:26.107
"here we're just going to
assume that we have y is a plus",01:00:26.107,01:00:28.440
"b1, x1 plus b2, x2, plus b3, x3.",01:00:28.440,01:00:31.650
"And we can write
it in a vector form",01:00:31.650,01:00:33.690
"by writing that Yi is
Xi transposed b, which",01:00:33.690,01:00:39.210
is now a vector plus epsilon i.,01:00:39.210,01:00:42.770
"OK, and here, on
the board, I'm going",01:00:42.770,01:00:44.520
"to have a hard time
doing boldface,",01:00:44.520,01:00:46.980
"but all these things are
vectors except for y,",01:00:46.980,01:00:52.360
which is a number.,01:00:52.360,01:00:53.520
Yi is a number.,01:00:53.520,01:00:54.450
"It's always the
value of my y-axis.",01:00:54.450,01:00:57.780
So even if my x-axis lives on--,01:00:57.780,01:00:59.930
"this is x1, and this is x2, y
is really just the real valued",01:00:59.930,01:01:04.350
function.,01:01:04.350,01:01:05.249
"And so I'm going to get
a bunch of points, x1,y1,",01:01:05.249,01:01:07.290
"and I'm going to see
how much they respond.",01:01:07.290,01:01:10.380
"So for example, my
body density is y,",01:01:10.380,01:01:13.560
"and then all the x's are
a bunch of other things.",01:01:13.560,01:01:16.562
Agreed with that?,01:01:16.562,01:01:17.270
"So this is an equation that
holds on the real line,",01:01:17.270,01:01:20.870
"but this guy here is an r
p, and this guy's an rp.",01:01:20.870,01:01:27.390
"It's actually common to
talk to call b, beta,",01:01:30.080,01:01:33.550
"when it's a vector, and that's
the usual linear regression",01:01:33.550,01:01:38.650
notation.,01:01:38.650,01:01:39.370
Y is x beta plus epsilon.,01:01:39.370,01:01:42.470
"So x's are called
explanatory variables.",01:01:42.470,01:01:45.780
"y is called explained variable,
or dependent variable,",01:01:45.780,01:01:50.600
or response variable.,01:01:50.600,01:01:52.000
It has a bunch of names.,01:01:52.000,01:01:53.050
"You can use whatever you
feel more comfortable with.",01:01:53.050,01:01:55.877
"It should actually
be explicit, right,",01:01:55.877,01:01:57.460
so that's all you care about.,01:01:57.460,01:01:58.668
"Now, what we typically do
is that rather-- so you",01:02:01.100,01:02:05.840
"notice here, that there's
actually no intercept.",01:02:05.840,01:02:07.840
"If I actually fold that
back down to one dimension,",01:02:07.840,01:02:10.840
"there's actually a is
equal to zero, right?",01:02:10.840,01:02:13.210
"If I go back to p
is equal to 1, that",01:02:13.210,01:02:18.350
"would imply that Yi is,
well, say, beta times",01:02:18.350,01:02:22.430
x plus epsilon i.,01:02:22.430,01:02:24.979
"And that's not good, I
want to have an intercept.",01:02:24.979,01:02:27.020
"And the way I do this,
rather than writing",01:02:27.020,01:02:29.480
"a plus this, and
you know, just have",01:02:29.480,01:02:31.910
"like an overload of notation,
what I am actually doing",01:02:31.910,01:02:35.420
is that I fold back.,01:02:35.420,01:02:37.670
"I fold my intercept
back into my x.",01:02:37.670,01:02:40.750
"And so if I measure
20 variables,",01:02:43.460,01:02:46.190
"I'm going to create a
21st variable, which",01:02:46.190,01:02:48.080
is always equal to 1.,01:02:48.080,01:02:49.700
"OK, so you should need
to think of x as being 1.",01:02:49.700,01:02:52.650
And then x1 xp.,01:02:52.650,01:02:58.120
"And sorry, xp minus 1, I guess.",01:02:58.120,01:03:00.790
"OK, and now this is an rp.",01:03:00.790,01:03:02.293
"I'm always going to assume
that the first one is 1.",01:03:05.590,01:03:07.900
I can always do that.,01:03:07.900,01:03:09.250
If I have a table of data--,01:03:09.250,01:03:11.320
"if my data is given to me
in an Excel spreadsheet--",01:03:11.320,01:03:15.940
"and here I have the density
that I measured on my data,",01:03:15.940,01:03:19.990
"and then maybe here
I have the height,",01:03:19.990,01:03:22.940
"and here I have the
wrist circumference.",01:03:22.940,01:03:25.544
And I have all these things.,01:03:25.544,01:03:26.710
"All I have to do is to create
another column here of ones,",01:03:26.710,01:03:31.100
and I just put 1-1-1-1-1.,01:03:31.100,01:03:34.180
"OK, that's all I have to
do to create this guy.",01:03:34.180,01:03:37.090
Agreed?,01:03:37.090,01:03:39.190
"And now my x is going to
be just one of those rows.",01:03:39.190,01:03:43.940
"So that's this is
Xi, this entire row.",01:03:43.940,01:03:46.190
And this entry here is Yi.,01:03:46.190,01:03:47.622
"So now, for my
noise coefficients,",01:03:54.430,01:03:56.920
"I'm still going to
ask for the same thing",01:03:56.920,01:03:59.300

covariance is not between x--",01:03:59.300,01:04:04.090

"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah, I
mean, the covariance vector",01:04:31.380,01:04:33.630
"is equal to 0 is the same thing
as [INAUDIBLE] equal to zero,",01:04:33.630,01:04:36.171

thought of entry-wise.",01:04:36.171,01:04:39.270

for all coordinates.",01:04:47.430,01:04:50.370

instances, we're going",01:04:50.370,01:04:52.020
"to think that epsilon
is independent",01:04:52.020,01:04:53.520

can understand without thinking",01:04:53.520,01:04:56.310
about coordinates.,01:04:56.310,01:04:59.022

can you repeat the question?",01:05:06.774,01:05:09.190

become the whole vector of beta",01:05:14.141,01:05:18.485
now.,01:05:18.485,01:05:19.394
"AUDIENCE: And
what's [INAUDIBLE]??",01:05:19.394,01:05:20.810
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Well, can
you think of an intercept",01:05:22.720,01:05:25.219
of a function that take--,01:05:25.219,01:05:26.260
"I mean, there is one actually.",01:05:26.260,01:05:28.630
"There's the one
for which betas--",01:05:28.630,01:05:30.370
"all the betas that
don't correspond",01:05:30.370,01:05:31.840
"to the vector of all
ones, so the intercept",01:05:31.840,01:05:35.200
"is really the weight
that I put on this guy.",01:05:35.200,01:05:38.469
"That's the beta that's
going to come to this guy,",01:05:38.469,01:05:40.510
"but we don't really
talk about intercept.",01:05:40.510,01:05:44.310
"So if x lives in two
dimensions, the way",01:05:44.310,01:05:49.210
"you want to think
about this is you",01:05:49.210,01:05:50.950
"take a sheet of paper
like that, so now I",01:05:50.950,01:05:54.420
"have points that live
in three dimensions.",01:05:54.420,01:05:57.080
"So let's say one
direction here is x1.",01:05:57.080,01:05:59.320
"This direction is x2,
and this direction is y.",01:05:59.320,01:06:02.710

to happen is that I'm",01:06:02.710,01:06:04.960
"going to have my points
that live in this three",01:06:04.960,01:06:07.120
dimensional space.,01:06:07.120,01:06:08.710
"And what I'm trying
to do when I'm",01:06:08.710,01:06:10.180
"trying to do a linear
model for those guys--",01:06:10.180,01:06:12.580
when I assume a linear model.,01:06:12.580,01:06:13.990
"What I assume is that there's
a plane in those three",01:06:13.990,01:06:17.380
dimensions.,01:06:17.380,01:06:17.950
"So think of this guy
as going everywhere,",01:06:17.950,01:06:20.170
"and there's a plane close to
which all my points should be.",01:06:20.170,01:06:23.920
"That's what's happening
in two dimensional.",01:06:23.920,01:06:26.320
"If you see higher dimensions
then congratulations to you,",01:06:26.320,01:06:29.930
but I can't.,01:06:29.930,01:06:30.975
"But you know, you can definitely
formalize that fairly easily",01:06:33.530,01:06:36.470
"mathematically and just
talk about vectors.",01:06:36.470,01:06:38.405
"So now here, if I talk about the
least square error estimator,",01:06:40.940,01:06:44.200
"or just the least squares
estimator of beta,",01:06:44.200,01:06:47.470
"it's simply the same
thing as before.",01:06:47.470,01:06:49.990
Just like we said--,01:06:49.990,01:06:52.460
"so remember, you
should think of as beta",01:06:52.460,01:06:56.750
"as being both the
pair a b generalized.",01:06:56.750,01:06:59.930
"So we said, oh, we wanted to
minimize the expectation of y",01:06:59.930,01:07:05.060
"minus a plus bx squared, right?",01:07:05.060,01:07:13.640
"Now, so that's in--
for p is equal to 1.",01:07:13.640,01:07:16.910
"Now for p lower
than or equal to 2,",01:07:16.910,01:07:19.510
"we're just going to write it
as y minus x transpose beta",01:07:19.510,01:07:28.760
squared.,01:07:28.760,01:07:29.260
"OK, so I'm just trying to
minimize this quantity.",01:07:34.210,01:07:37.900
"Of course, I don't
have access to this,",01:07:37.900,01:07:40.857
"so what I'm going to do
with them going to replace",01:07:40.857,01:07:42.940
my expectation by an average.,01:07:42.940,01:07:44.881
"So here I'm using the notation
t because beta is the true one,",01:07:51.010,01:07:54.890
and I don't want you to just--,01:07:54.890,01:07:56.960
"so here, I have a variable
t that's just moving around.",01:07:56.960,01:07:59.960
"And so now I'm going to take
the square of this thing.",01:07:59.960,01:08:02.390
"And when I minimize this over
all t in rp, the arc min,",01:08:02.390,01:08:08.450

hat, which is my estimator.",01:08:08.450,01:08:19.584
OK?,01:08:19.584,01:08:20.084

actually compute--",01:08:25.359,01:08:29.337
yeah?,01:08:29.337,01:08:29.837

on the last slide",01:08:29.837,01:08:31.420

"AUDIENCE: So I'm saying like
[? in that sign, ?] we'll say",01:08:46.539,01:08:48.984
"the noise [? terms ?] we want to
satisfy the covariance of that",01:08:48.984,01:08:51.918
"[? side. ?] We also want them
to satisfy expectation of each",01:08:51.918,01:08:55.830
[? noise turn ?] zero?,01:08:55.830,01:08:56.808
"PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: And
so the answer is yes.",01:09:07.827,01:09:09.660
"I was just trying to think
if this was captured.",01:09:09.660,01:09:13.050
"So it is not
captured in this guy",01:09:13.050,01:09:15.180
"because this is just telling
me that the expectation",01:09:15.180,01:09:17.700
"of epsilon i minus expectation
of some i is equal to zero.",01:09:17.700,01:09:23.750
"OK, so yes I need to have
that epsilon has mean zero--",01:09:23.750,01:09:27.380
"let's assume that
expectation of epsilon",01:09:27.380,01:09:29.130
is zero for this problem.,01:09:29.130,01:09:31.545
"And we're going
to need something",01:09:43.640,01:09:45.374
"about some sort of question
about the variance being",01:09:45.374,01:09:47.540
"not equal to zero, right, but
this is going to come up later.",01:09:47.540,01:09:51.060
"So let's think for one second
about doing the same approach",01:09:51.060,01:09:54.710
as we did before.,01:09:54.710,01:09:55.490
"Take the partial
derivative with respect",01:09:55.490,01:09:57.320
"to the first coordinate
of t, with respect",01:09:57.320,01:09:59.279
"to the second coordinate
of t, with respect",01:09:59.279,01:10:01.070
"to the third coordinate
of t, et cetera.",01:10:01.070,01:10:03.320
So that's what we did before.,01:10:03.320,01:10:04.610
"We had two equations,
and we reconciled them",01:10:04.610,01:10:07.460
"because it was fairly
easy to solve, right?",01:10:07.460,01:10:10.190
"But in general,
what's going to happen",01:10:10.190,01:10:11.826
"is we're going to have
a system of equations.",01:10:11.826,01:10:13.700
"We're going to have a system
of p equations, one for each",01:10:13.700,01:10:17.150
of the coordinates of t.,01:10:17.150,01:10:19.340
"And we're going to have p
unknowns, each coordinate of t.",01:10:19.340,01:10:23.960
"And so we're going to
have the system to solve--",01:10:23.960,01:10:26.559
"actually, i turns out it's
going to be a linear system.",01:10:26.559,01:10:28.850
"But it's not going
to be something",01:10:28.850,01:10:29.960
"that we're going to be able to
solve coordinate by coordinate.",01:10:29.960,01:10:32.543
"It's going to be
annoying to solve.",01:10:32.543,01:10:34.020
"You know, you can guess that
what's going to happen, right.",01:10:34.020,01:10:36.820
"Here, it involved the covariance
between x and epsilon, right.",01:10:36.820,01:10:40.700
"That's what it involved
to understand--",01:10:40.700,01:10:43.910
"sorry, the correlation
between x and y",01:10:43.910,01:10:47.540
"to understand how the
solution of this problem was.",01:10:47.540,01:10:50.660
"In this case,
there's going to be",01:10:50.660,01:10:52.070
"only the covariance between
x1 and y, x2 and y, x3, et",01:10:52.070,01:10:57.930
"cetera, all the way to xp and y.",01:10:57.930,01:10:59.510
"There's also going to be all
the cross covariances between xj",01:10:59.510,01:11:02.960
and xk.,01:11:02.960,01:11:04.077
"And so this is going
to be a nightmare",01:11:04.077,01:11:05.660
"to solve, like, in this system.",01:11:05.660,01:11:08.210
"And what we do is that we go
on to using a matrix notation,",01:11:08.210,01:11:12.100
"so that when we
take derivatives,",01:11:12.100,01:11:14.600
"we talk about
gradients, and then we",01:11:14.600,01:11:16.340
"can invert matrices and solve
linear systems in a somewhat",01:11:16.340,01:11:20.390
"formal manner by just saying
that, if I want to solve",01:11:20.390,01:11:23.330
the system ax equals b--,01:11:23.330,01:11:27.230
"rather than actually
solving this",01:11:27.230,01:11:28.760
"for each coordinate
of x individually,",01:11:28.760,01:11:30.440
"I just say that x is
equal to a inverse times.",01:11:30.440,01:11:33.770
"So that's really why we're
going to the equation one,",01:11:33.770,01:11:37.490
"because we have a
formalism to write that x",01:11:37.490,01:11:40.730
is the solution of the system.,01:11:40.730,01:11:42.260
"I'm not telling you
that this is going",01:11:42.260,01:11:43.843
"to be easy to solve numerically,
but at least I can write it.",01:11:43.843,01:11:48.110
And so here's how it goes.,01:11:48.110,01:11:51.307
I have a bunch of vectors.,01:11:51.307,01:11:52.390
"So what are my vectors, right?",01:11:55.540,01:11:56.790
So I have x1--,01:11:56.790,01:11:57.875
"oh, by the way,
I didn't actually",01:11:57.875,01:11:59.250
"mention that when I
put the lowercase, when",01:11:59.250,01:12:01.320
"I put the subscript, I'm
talking about the observation.",01:12:01.320,01:12:03.660
"And when I put the
superscript, I'm",01:12:03.660,01:12:05.118
"talking about the
coordinates, right?",01:12:05.118,01:12:07.110
"So I have x1, which is
equal to x1, x1 [? 1, ?]",01:12:07.110,01:12:13.290
"x 1p, x2, which is 1.",01:12:13.290,01:12:19.965
"x2, 1, x2 p, all the way to
xn, which is 1, xn 1, x np.",01:12:19.965,01:12:32.380
"All right, so those are n
observed x's, and then I",01:12:32.380,01:12:35.210
"have another y1, y2, yn, that
comes paired with those guys.",01:12:35.210,01:12:40.870
OK?,01:12:40.870,01:12:42.510
"So the first thing
is that I'm going",01:12:42.510,01:12:44.640
"to stack those guys
into some vector",01:12:44.640,01:12:46.290
that I'm going to call y.,01:12:46.290,01:12:47.520
"So maybe I should put
an arrow for the purpose",01:12:47.520,01:12:49.710
"of the blackboard, and
it's just y1 to yn.",01:12:49.710,01:12:53.310
"OK, so this is a vector in rn.",01:12:53.310,01:12:56.720
"Now, if I want to stack
those guys together,",01:12:56.720,01:12:59.150
"I can either create a long
vector of size n times p,",01:12:59.150,01:13:03.449
"but the problem is that I lose
the role of who's a coordinate",01:13:03.449,01:13:05.990
and who's an observation.,01:13:05.990,01:13:08.815
"And so it's actually
nicer for me",01:13:08.815,01:13:10.190
"to just put those guys
next to each other",01:13:10.190,01:13:12.840
and create one new variable.,01:13:12.840,01:13:15.320
"And so the way I'm going to do
this is-- rather than actually",01:13:15.320,01:13:18.020
"stacking those guys like that,
I'm getting their transpose",01:13:18.020,01:13:22.220
"and stack them as
rows of a matrix.",01:13:22.220,01:13:24.530
"OK, so I'm going to
create a matrix, which",01:13:24.530,01:13:26.870
here is denoted typically by--,01:13:26.870,01:13:28.700
I'm going to write x double bar.,01:13:28.700,01:13:31.295
"And here, I'm going to
actually just-- so since I'm",01:13:31.295,01:13:33.420
"taking those guys like
this, the first column",01:13:33.420,01:13:35.940
is going to be only ones.,01:13:35.940,01:13:37.010
And then I'm going to have--,01:13:40.510,01:13:41.950
"well, x1, 1, [? 1, ?] x1, p.",01:13:41.950,01:13:47.130
"And here, I'm going
to have x n1, x np.",01:13:47.130,01:13:52.890
"OK, so here the number of rows
is n, and the number of columns",01:13:52.890,01:13:57.690
is p.,01:13:57.690,01:13:58.800
"One row per observation,
one column per coordinate.",01:13:58.800,01:14:02.352
"And again, I make your life
miserable because this really",01:14:05.010,01:14:10.710
"should be p minus 1
because I already used",01:14:10.710,01:14:13.380
the first one for this guy.,01:14:13.380,01:14:15.850
I'm sorry about that.,01:14:15.850,01:14:16.820
It's a bit painful.,01:14:16.820,01:14:18.400
"So usually we don't even
write what's in there.",01:14:18.400,01:14:20.490
"So we don't have
to think about it.",01:14:20.490,01:14:21.948
"Those are just
vectors of size p.",01:14:21.948,01:14:23.970
OK?,01:14:23.970,01:14:25.380
"So now that I
created this thing,",01:14:25.380,01:14:27.740
"I can actually just basically
stack up all my models.",01:14:27.740,01:14:31.340
"So Yi equals Xi transpose
beta plus epsilon i for all i",01:14:31.340,01:14:39.270
equal 1 to n.,01:14:39.270,01:14:41.430
"This transforms into-- this
is equivalent to saying",01:14:41.430,01:14:44.010
"that the vector y is
equal to the matrix x",01:14:44.010,01:14:47.610
"times beta plus a matrix,
plus a vector epsilon,",01:14:47.610,01:14:51.150
"where epsilon is just epsilon
1 to epsilon n, right.",01:14:51.150,01:14:57.940
"So I have just
this system, which",01:14:57.940,01:14:59.830
"I write as a matrix,
which really just consists",01:14:59.830,01:15:02.000
"in stacking up all these
equations next to each other.",01:15:02.000,01:15:04.900
"So now that I have this model--
this is the usual least squares",01:15:10.195,01:15:12.820
model.,01:15:12.820,01:15:13.330
"And here, when I want to write
my least squares criterion",01:15:13.330,01:15:16.150
"in terms of matrices, right?",01:15:16.150,01:15:17.500
"My least squares
criterion, remember,",01:15:17.500,01:15:19.041
"was sum from i equal 1 to n
of Yi minus Xi transposed beta",01:15:19.041,01:15:27.010
squared.,01:15:27.010,01:15:28.210
"Well, here it's
really just the sum",01:15:28.210,01:15:31.060
"of the square of the
coefficients of the vector",01:15:31.060,01:15:35.260
y minus x beta.,01:15:35.260,01:15:37.540
"So this is actually
equal to the norm squared",01:15:37.540,01:15:40.380
of y minus x beta square.,01:15:40.380,01:15:43.090
That's just the square.,01:15:46.382,01:15:47.340
"Norm is, by definition,
the sum of the square",01:15:47.340,01:15:49.470
of the coordinates.,01:15:49.470,01:15:51.720
"And so now I can actually
talk about minimizing",01:15:51.720,01:15:53.885
"a norm squared,
and here it's going",01:15:53.885,01:15:56.090
"to be easier for me
to take derivatives.",01:15:56.090,01:15:58.160
"All right, so we'll
do that next time.",01:15:58.160,01:16:01.300
