Hi.,00:00:00.390,00:00:01.170
"In this problem, we'll get some
practice working with",00:00:01.170,00:00:03.250
"PDFs and also using PDFs
to calculate CDFs.",00:00:03.250,00:00:08.000
"So the PDF that we're given
in this problem is here.",00:00:08.000,00:00:11.170
"So we have a random variable,
z, which is a continuous",00:00:11.170,00:00:13.390
random variable.,00:00:13.390,00:00:14.250
"And we're told that the PDF of
this random variable, z, is",00:00:14.250,00:00:17.550
"given by gamma times 1 plus z
squared in the range of z",00:00:17.550,00:00:21.790
between negative 2 and 1.,00:00:21.790,00:00:23.480
"And outside of this
range, it's 0.",00:00:23.480,00:00:26.520
"All right, so first thing we
need to do and the first part",00:00:26.520,00:00:29.850
"of this problem is we need to
figure out what gamma is",00:00:29.850,00:00:32.420
"because it's not really a
fully specified PDF yet.",00:00:32.420,00:00:35.250
"We need to figure out exactly
what the value gamma is.",00:00:35.250,00:00:37.490
And how do we do that?,00:00:37.490,00:00:38.620
"Well, we've done analogous
things before for",00:00:38.620,00:00:40.670
the discrete case.,00:00:40.670,00:00:42.360
"So the tool that we use
is that the PDF must",00:00:42.360,00:00:46.200
integrate to 1.,00:00:46.200,00:00:47.130
"So in the discrete case, the
analogy was that the PMF had",00:00:47.130,00:00:50.240
to sum to 1.,00:00:50.240,00:00:52.140
So what do we know?,00:00:52.140,00:00:53.150
"We know that when you integrate
this PDF from",00:00:53.150,00:00:56.380
"negative infinity to infinity,
fz of z, it has to equal 1.",00:00:56.380,00:01:04.330
"All right, so what
do we do now?",00:01:04.330,00:01:07.050
"Well, we know what
the PDF is--",00:01:07.050,00:01:09.300
"partially, except for gamma--
so let's plug that in.",00:01:09.300,00:01:11.880
"And the first thing that we'll
do is we'll simplify this",00:01:11.880,00:01:15.150
"because we know that the PDF is
actually only non-zero in",00:01:15.150,00:01:20.440
the range negative 2 to 1.,00:01:20.440,00:01:21.580
"So instead of integrating from
negative infinity to infinity,",00:01:21.580,00:01:23.900
"we'll just integrate from
negative 2 to 1.",00:01:23.900,00:01:26.580
"And now let's plug in
this gamma times 1",00:01:26.580,00:01:30.190
plus z squared dc.,00:01:30.190,00:01:34.380
"And now the rest of the problem
is just applying",00:01:34.380,00:01:36.610
calculus and integrating this.,00:01:36.610,00:01:38.350
"So let's just go through
that process.",00:01:38.350,00:01:42.480
"So we get z plus 1/3 z cubed
from minus 2 to 1.",00:01:42.480,00:01:50.720
"And now we'll plug
in the limits.",00:01:50.720,00:01:53.340
"And we get gamma, and that's 1
plus 1/3 minus minus 2 plus",00:01:53.340,00:02:02.280
1/3 times minus 2 cubed.,00:02:02.280,00:02:04.816
 ,00:02:04.816,00:02:08.470
"And then if we add this all up,
you get 4/3 plus 2 plus",00:02:08.470,00:02:13.980
"8/3, which will give you 6.",00:02:13.980,00:02:17.130
"So what we end up with
in the end is that 1",00:02:17.130,00:02:22.280
is equal to 6 gamma.,00:02:22.280,00:02:23.690
So what does that tell us?,00:02:23.690,00:02:24.640
"That tells us that, in this
case, gamma is 1/6.",00:02:24.640,00:02:29.110
 ,00:02:29.110,00:02:32.030
"OK, so we've actually figured
out what this PDF really is.",00:02:32.030,00:02:37.420
"And let's just substitute
that in.",00:02:37.420,00:02:41.870
So we know what gamma is.,00:02:41.870,00:02:46.610
So it's 1/6.,00:02:46.610,00:02:48.970
"So from this PDF, we can
calculate anything",00:02:48.970,00:02:52.190
that we want to.,00:02:52.190,00:02:53.430
"This PDF, basically, fully
specifies everything that we",00:02:53.430,00:02:56.930
"need to know about this
random variable, z.",00:02:56.930,00:02:59.420
"And one of the things that
we can calculate from",00:02:59.420,00:03:00.980
the PDF is the CDF.,00:03:00.980,00:03:03.520
"So the next part of the
problem asks us to",00:03:03.520,00:03:05.830
calculate the CDF.,00:03:05.830,00:03:07.460
"So remember the CDF, we use
capital F. And the definition",00:03:07.460,00:03:13.350
"is that you integrate from
negative infinity to this z.",00:03:13.350,00:03:19.630
And what do you integrate?,00:03:19.630,00:03:20.650
You integrate the PDF.,00:03:20.650,00:03:22.120
"And all use some dummy variable,
y, here in the",00:03:22.120,00:03:26.580
integration.,00:03:26.580,00:03:28.420
So what is it really doing?,00:03:28.420,00:03:29.510
"It's basically just taking the
PDF and taking everything to",00:03:29.510,00:03:33.130
the left of it.,00:03:33.130,00:03:33.650
"So another way to think about
this-- this is the probability",00:03:33.650,00:03:38.920
"that the random variable
is less than or equal",00:03:38.920,00:03:42.290
to some little z.,00:03:42.290,00:03:44.620
"It's just accumulating
probability as you go from",00:03:44.620,00:03:48.020
left to right.,00:03:48.020,00:03:49.270
 ,00:03:49.270,00:03:51.580
"So the hardest part about
calculating the CDFs, really,",00:03:51.580,00:03:54.120
"is actually just keeping track
of the ranges, because unless",00:03:54.120,00:03:59.710
"the PDF is really simple, you'll
have cases where the",00:03:59.710,00:04:03.340
"PDF cold be 0 in some ranges and
non-zero in other ranges.",00:04:03.340,00:04:06.820
"And then what you really have
to keep track of is where",00:04:06.820,00:04:09.710
"those ranges are and where you
actually have non-zero",00:04:09.710,00:04:12.800
probability.,00:04:12.800,00:04:14.040
"So in this case, we actually
break things down into three",00:04:14.040,00:04:17.120
"different ranges because
this PDF actually looks",00:04:17.120,00:04:21.370
something like this.,00:04:21.370,00:04:24.600
"So it's non-zero between
negative 2 and 1, and it's 0",00:04:24.600,00:04:31.060
everywhere else.,00:04:31.060,00:04:33.250
"So then what that means is
that our job is a little",00:04:33.250,00:04:35.700
"simpler because everything to
the left of negative 2, the",00:04:35.700,00:04:40.070
"CDF will be 0 because there's
no probability",00:04:40.070,00:04:42.510
density to the left.,00:04:42.510,00:04:44.190
"And then everything to the
right of 1, well we've",00:04:44.190,00:04:49.710
"accumulated all the probability
in the PDF because",00:04:49.710,00:04:52.780
"we know that when you integrate
from negative 2 to",00:04:52.780,00:04:55.640
"1, you capture everything.",00:04:55.640,00:04:57.060
"So anything to the right of
1, the CDF will be 1.",00:04:57.060,00:05:00.510
"So the only hard part is
calculating what the CDF is in",00:05:00.510,00:05:05.370
"this intermediate range, between
negative 2 and 1.",00:05:05.370,00:05:08.390
So let's do that case first--,00:05:08.390,00:05:10.300
"so the case of z is between
negative 2 and 1.",00:05:10.300,00:05:17.910
 ,00:05:17.910,00:05:22.850
"So what is the CDF
in that case?",00:05:22.850,00:05:24.980
"Well, the definition is to
integrate from negative",00:05:24.980,00:05:32.690
infinity to z.,00:05:32.690,00:05:34.190
"But we know that everything
to the left of negative 2,",00:05:34.190,00:05:37.610
there's no probably density.,00:05:37.610,00:05:39.010
"So we don't need to
include that.",00:05:39.010,00:05:40.550
"So we can actually change this
lower limit to negative 2.",00:05:40.550,00:05:43.340
"And the upper limit is
wherever this z is.",00:05:43.340,00:05:48.500
So that becomes our integral.,00:05:48.500,00:05:51.410
"And the inside is
still the PDF.",00:05:51.410,00:05:53.560
So let's just plug that in.,00:05:53.560,00:05:56.550
We know that it's 1/6 1 plus--,00:05:56.550,00:06:00.680
we'll make this y squared--,00:06:00.680,00:06:04.620
by.,00:06:04.620,00:06:07.130
"And now it's just
calculus again.",00:06:07.130,00:06:09.910
"And in fact, it's more or less
the same integral, so what we",00:06:09.910,00:06:12.800
"get is y plus 1/3 y cubed
from negative 2 to z.",00:06:12.800,00:06:22.370
"Notice the only thing that's
different here is that we're",00:06:22.370,00:06:24.760
"integrating from negative 2 to
z instead of negative 2 to 1.",00:06:24.760,00:06:30.180
"And when we calculate this out,
what we get is z plus 1/3",00:06:30.180,00:06:37.360
"z cubed minus minus 2 plus 1/3
minus 2 cubed, which gives us",00:06:37.360,00:06:48.520
"1/6 z plus 1/3 z cubed plus plus
2 plus 8/3 gives us 14/3.",00:06:48.520,00:07:01.976
 ,00:07:01.976,00:07:06.470
"So that actually is our CDF
between the range of",00:07:06.470,00:07:10.730
negative 2 to 1.,00:07:10.730,00:07:12.660
"So for full completeness, let's
actually write out the",00:07:12.660,00:07:15.450
"entire CDF, because there's two
other parts in the CDF.",00:07:15.450,00:07:20.950
"So the first part is that
it's 0 if z is less",00:07:20.950,00:07:26.380
than negative 2.,00:07:26.380,00:07:28.530
"And it's 1 if z is
greater than 1.",00:07:28.530,00:07:34.850
"And in between, it's this
thing that we've just",00:07:34.850,00:07:37.190
calculated.,00:07:37.190,00:07:37.340
"So it's 1/6 z plus 1/3 z cubed
plus 14/3 if z is between",00:07:37.340,00:07:55.240
minus 2 and 1.,00:07:55.240,00:07:58.410
So that is our final answer.,00:07:58.410,00:08:00.650
 ,00:08:00.650,00:08:03.170
"So the main point of this
problem was to drill a little",00:08:03.170,00:08:07.400
"bit more the concepts
of PDFs and CDFs.",00:08:07.400,00:08:10.400
"So for the PDF, the important
thing to remember is that in",00:08:10.400,00:08:13.320
"order to be a valid PDF, the
PDF has to integrate to 1.",00:08:13.320,00:08:16.970
"And you can use that fact to
help you calculate any unknown",00:08:16.970,00:08:19.790
constants in the PDF.,00:08:19.790,00:08:21.450
"And then to calculate the CDF,
it's just integrating the PDF",00:08:21.450,00:08:24.980
"from negative infinity to
whatever point that you want",00:08:24.980,00:08:27.490
to cut off at.,00:08:27.490,00:08:28.290
"And the tricky part, as I said
earlier, was really just",00:08:28.290,00:08:31.270
keeping track of the ranges.,00:08:31.270,00:08:32.230
"In this case, we've broke it
down into three ranges.",00:08:32.230,00:08:34.159
"If we had a slightly more
complicated PDF, then you",00:08:34.159,00:08:37.120
"would have to keep track
of even more ranged.",00:08:37.120,00:08:40.710
"All right, so I hope that
was helpful, and we'll",00:08:40.710,00:08:42.429
see you next time.,00:08:42.429,00:08:43.679
 ,00:08:43.679,00:08:44.579
