"PROFESSOR: So
welcome to this week.",00:00:23.310,00:00:26.490
"We are going to talk
about number theory.",00:00:26.490,00:00:28.980
"Actually, before I
forget, there are",00:00:28.980,00:00:30.560
some handouts at the very back.,00:00:30.560,00:00:32.450
"Please raise you hand if you
don't have any, then one of us",00:00:32.450,00:00:35.670
"can actually come
over and hand you",00:00:35.670,00:00:37.802
"out this sheet, which
contain some facts",00:00:37.802,00:00:41.070
about the visibility.,00:00:41.070,00:00:43.900
Thanks a lot.,00:00:43.900,00:00:45.824
"And we will be using these
throughout the lecture.",00:00:45.824,00:00:50.780
"So today we're going to
talk about number theory.",00:00:50.780,00:00:53.330
"And this is a really different
way of thinking, actually.",00:00:53.330,00:00:56.420
"But we will use
the same concepts",00:00:56.420,00:00:58.170
"as you have learned before,
like induction, and invariance,",00:00:58.170,00:01:01.280
"stuff like that, to
prove whole theorems.",00:01:01.280,00:01:04.179
So what is number theory?,00:01:04.179,00:01:05.220
"Well, first of all,
it's a very old science.",00:01:09.070,00:01:12.050
"One of the oldest
mathematical disciplines.",00:01:12.050,00:01:14.940
"And only recently
it actually got",00:01:14.940,00:01:19.340
"to have some more
practical applications.",00:01:19.340,00:01:21.480
So what this number theory--,00:01:21.480,00:01:23.450
"it's actually the
study of the integers.",00:01:23.450,00:01:28.200
And what are the integers?,00:01:31.580,00:01:33.160
"Well, these are the numbers
0, 1, 2 3, and so on.",00:01:33.160,00:01:38.950
So number theory got--,00:01:38.950,00:01:41.260
"Oh, there's some more over here.",00:01:41.260,00:01:44.430
Another handout over there.,00:01:44.430,00:01:45.555
"So number theory got used
actually in cryptography",00:01:48.530,00:01:53.870
only about 40 years ago.,00:01:53.870,00:01:56.890
"And at the end of
the second lecture,",00:01:56.890,00:01:59.880
"we will be talking about this
application into cryptography.",00:01:59.880,00:02:03.150
"There are many application
in cryptography.",00:02:03.150,00:02:05.970
"But we'll be talking
about one of them",00:02:05.970,00:02:07.700
"to show you how useful
this actually is.",00:02:07.700,00:02:10.500
"Now cryptography is the study
and practice of hiding numbers.",00:02:10.500,00:02:16.110
"So you can imagine
how important that is.",00:02:16.110,00:02:19.230
"We have like medical
data that we need",00:02:19.230,00:02:23.090
to store outside in the cloud.,00:02:23.090,00:02:25.360
Right?,00:02:25.360,00:02:25.860
"So, gee.",00:02:25.860,00:02:27.500
Do we really want that?,00:02:27.500,00:02:29.490
"We actually want to
hide our information.",00:02:29.490,00:02:33.200
"We do not want
others who are not",00:02:33.200,00:02:35.680
"allowed to see my private
information to see it.",00:02:35.680,00:02:39.030
"So this art of
hiding information",00:02:39.030,00:02:40.850
"is extremely important,
especially nowadays.",00:02:40.850,00:02:44.080
"And number theory actually
will help us with this.",00:02:44.080,00:02:47.020
"So number theory is something,
you'll be very surprised,",00:02:47.020,00:02:52.530
that can be used to save--,00:02:52.530,00:02:56.680

I have to put this on.,00:02:57.520,00:03:00.110
"To save New York City in the
Die Hard number 3, I believe.",00:03:00.110,00:03:04.550
So let me start up again.,00:03:04.550,00:03:05.960
So let's see where it plays.,00:03:16.339,00:03:17.505

How do we turn this thing off?,00:04:27.100,00:04:28.908
"-On the front there
should be two jugs.",00:04:28.908,00:04:30.830

-No.,00:04:55.930,00:04:56.429
-Get the jugs.,00:04:59.067,00:04:59.650

the three gallon jug will",00:05:02.407,00:05:04.490
"four gallons of water, right?",00:05:04.490,00:05:06.096
-Obviously.,00:05:06.096,00:05:06.690
-I know.,00:05:06.690,00:05:07.190
There we go.,00:05:07.190,00:05:08.610
"We fill the three gallon jug
exactly to the top, right?",00:05:08.610,00:05:11.210
-Uh-huh.,00:05:11.210,00:05:11.710
-OK.,00:05:11.710,00:05:12.210
"Now we pour that three gallons
into the five gallon jugs,",00:05:12.210,00:05:14.760

in the five gallon jug, right?",00:05:14.760,00:05:17.180
-Right.,00:05:17.180,00:05:17.680
Then what?,00:05:17.680,00:05:18.640
"-Now, we take the
three gallon jug,",00:05:18.640,00:05:20.799

"You can imagine what we are
going to do right here, right?",00:05:36.370,00:05:39.690
So.,00:05:39.690,00:05:42.510
"You can imagine what's
below this table is a bomb.",00:05:42.510,00:05:45.594

"So who has an idea
of what we can do?",00:06:00.040,00:06:02.380
So.,00:06:02.380,00:06:02.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:06:05.720,00:06:07.196
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:06:07.196,00:06:08.680
Let's first do that.,00:06:08.680,00:06:09.690
Fill up the three gallons.,00:06:09.690,00:06:11.180
"AUDIENCE: And pout
it into the five.",00:06:11.180,00:06:12.680
"PROFESSOR: Let's
pour it into five.",00:06:12.680,00:06:16.170
Maybe someone else can--,00:06:16.170,00:06:17.880
can continue.,00:06:17.880,00:06:19.010
Over there.,00:06:19.010,00:06:20.700
"AUDIENCE: If we
do the same again,",00:06:20.700,00:06:22.450
"we'll end up with just one
gallon in the three gallon.",00:06:22.450,00:06:26.000
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.,00:06:26.000,00:06:26.750
"So, let's do that.",00:06:26.750,00:06:28.405
"Because that's true, right.",00:06:28.405,00:06:29.530
"You can only fill it
up to five gallons.",00:06:29.530,00:06:32.010
"So only, at more,
two gallons can add",00:06:32.010,00:06:34.030
"to this, exactly two gallons.",00:06:34.030,00:06:36.190
And one gallon is left.,00:06:36.190,00:06:37.780
"All right, next one.",00:06:37.780,00:06:38.877

AUDIENCE: Take out the five.,00:06:40.168,00:06:41.335
PROFESSOR: Take out the five.,00:06:41.335,00:06:42.542
All right.,00:06:42.542,00:06:43.120
And then what?,00:06:47.300,00:06:48.424
"AUDIENCE: Pour the
one over there.",00:06:48.424,00:06:49.840

"AUDIENCE: Then fill
the three gallon,",00:06:56.769,00:06:58.310
and put it into the five.,00:06:58.310,00:07:00.042
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:07:00.042,00:07:01.399
That's great.,00:07:01.399,00:07:01.940
And I fill it up right here.,00:07:01.940,00:07:03.380
Fantastic.,00:07:03.380,00:07:04.720
"So we actually have
four gallons here.",00:07:04.720,00:07:07.690
"And luckily, they are safe.",00:07:07.690,00:07:08.870
Right?,00:07:08.870,00:07:09.370
"So you say, thank god.",00:07:09.370,00:07:10.730
6042,00:07:10.730,00:07:13.354
So we can continue.,00:07:13.354,00:07:14.145
"So this is actually
pretty amazing, though.",00:07:17.400,00:07:20.230
"How can we get four gallon
out of three gallon jug,",00:07:20.230,00:07:22.770
and a five gallon jug?,00:07:22.770,00:07:23.750
"And that's what we are
going to talk about in more",00:07:23.750,00:07:26.370
"generality, actually.",00:07:26.370,00:07:28.190
"And if you would just change
it a little bit, right?",00:07:28.190,00:07:32.250
"Then things would get more
difficult. For example,",00:07:32.250,00:07:36.060
"if you would change the five
gallon jug into a six gallon",00:07:36.060,00:07:40.850
"jug, can we still
get four gallons?",00:07:40.850,00:07:44.320
No.,00:07:44.320,00:07:44.820
Why not?,00:07:44.820,00:07:45.319
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:07:47.695,00:07:49.690
"PROFESSOR: Everything has
to be multiples of three.",00:07:49.690,00:07:51.826
That's exactly right.,00:07:51.826,00:07:54.410
This is a multiple of 3.,00:07:54.410,00:07:55.510
1 times 3.,00:07:55.510,00:07:56.190
This is 2 times 3.,00:07:56.190,00:07:57.280
"So if I do combinations
with those,",00:07:57.280,00:07:59.770
"like pouring one into the
other completely, or emptying,",00:07:59.770,00:08:03.440
"of filling up, we
always will have",00:08:03.440,00:08:05.350
"a multiple of three gallons in
either one of those, or both.",00:08:05.350,00:08:10.160
"So we can never
have four gallons.",00:08:10.160,00:08:12.630
"So this is something
that we would like",00:08:12.630,00:08:15.540
to analyze a little bit more.,00:08:15.540,00:08:16.960
"And to do that, we're
going to first a all",00:08:16.960,00:08:20.420
start with a definition.,00:08:20.420,00:08:22.080
"Actually you can put up
the screen over here.",00:08:22.080,00:08:25.080
So let me take that out.,00:08:28.480,00:08:29.930
"Can someone up there
pull up the screen?",00:08:33.840,00:08:37.610
Maybe not?,00:08:37.610,00:08:38.520
Maybe later.,00:08:38.520,00:08:40.190
All right.,00:08:40.190,00:08:40.840
So let's go with a definition.,00:08:40.840,00:08:42.524
"We say n denote by m and a bar,
and a, we mean m defines a.",00:08:48.150,00:08:59.340
And how do you define this?,00:08:59.340,00:09:00.920
"Well, we say that n
divides a, if and only",00:09:00.920,00:09:04.910
"if there exists an
integer k, such that a can",00:09:04.910,00:09:11.260
"be written as some multiple
m, mainly k times m.",00:09:11.260,00:09:18.100
"So if you look at
this definition",00:09:18.100,00:09:21.980
"we, for example, have
that 3 divides 6,",00:09:21.980,00:09:25.100
like what we just discussed.,00:09:25.100,00:09:27.645
"There's something
interesting going on.",00:09:27.645,00:09:29.270
Suppose a is equal to 0.,00:09:29.270,00:09:33.160
"Well, any integer will
define a, will define 0.",00:09:33.160,00:09:38.030
Why is that?,00:09:38.030,00:09:39.030
"Because I can't take
k to be equal to 0,",00:09:39.030,00:09:42.090
"so this is equal to 0
times any integer m.",00:09:42.090,00:09:45.190
So m defines 0 for all integers.,00:09:45.190,00:09:48.910
"So this is kind of
the exception, right?",00:09:48.910,00:09:51.440
"And we are going to use
this to set up a theorem,",00:09:51.440,00:09:56.840
"and analyze this whole
situation over here.",00:09:56.840,00:10:02.090
"Now in order to do that, we
will need to sort of define",00:10:02.090,00:10:08.310
what we can do with all this.,00:10:08.310,00:10:09.790
So there are states.,00:10:09.790,00:10:12.710
We will define a state machine.,00:10:12.710,00:10:14.940
"We will see what kind
of possible transitions",00:10:14.940,00:10:18.060
we can have.,00:10:18.060,00:10:19.230
"And once we have modeled
all this very precisely,",00:10:19.230,00:10:22.120
we can start proofing stuff.,00:10:22.120,00:10:25.520
"Now let me first of all write
out what our assumptions are.",00:10:25.520,00:10:30.970
"So suppose we have
an a gallon jug.",00:10:30.970,00:10:36.980
"So in our case, a equals 3.",00:10:40.110,00:10:44.500
And we have also b gallon jug.,00:10:44.500,00:10:46.480
"And in our case,
b equals 5, right?",00:10:50.140,00:10:53.740
"And we issue that
a is at most b.",00:10:53.740,00:10:58.180
"That is sort of the situation
that we are working with.",00:10:58.180,00:11:01.169
"And he would like
to prove a theorem.",00:11:01.169,00:11:02.710
"Exactly what we notice over
here, that three defines both.",00:11:05.220,00:11:08.330
"The three gallon jug,
and the six gallon jug,",00:11:08.330,00:11:10.580
"we would like to prove
something like this.",00:11:10.580,00:11:13.740
"If m defines a, and
also m defines be,",00:11:13.740,00:11:20.270
"well, then m should
define any results",00:11:20.270,00:11:26.720
"that I can get with the pouring,
and emptying and filling",00:11:26.720,00:11:32.670
those jugs.,00:11:32.670,00:11:34.042
"So this is the theorem,
if you'd like to prove.",00:11:34.042,00:11:36.000
"And we can only do that
if you start to have",00:11:36.000,00:11:38.080
a proper model for this.,00:11:38.080,00:11:40.380
So let's go for that.,00:11:40.380,00:11:43.020
And--,00:11:43.020,00:11:44.060
"And, well, the state machine
that we're going to use here",00:11:47.490,00:11:52.570
looks like this.,00:11:52.570,00:11:53.380
"First of all, the
states that we have",00:12:00.570,00:12:05.060
"are the number of gallons
that are in these two jugs.",00:12:05.060,00:12:08.750
"So we will denote
those by pairs.",00:12:08.750,00:12:10.575
"Pairs x, comma y.",00:12:13.810,00:12:16.700
"And x denotes the number of
gallons in the a gallon jug.",00:12:16.700,00:12:24.020
"The number of gallons m m that
we abbreviate as by the a jug,",00:12:26.640,00:12:33.560
"and y is the number of
gallons in the b jug.",00:12:33.560,00:12:41.970
So these are the states.,00:12:41.970,00:12:43.960
"And the start state it
exactly as it is right there.",00:12:43.960,00:12:49.760
"We have nothing in
either of the jugs.",00:12:49.760,00:12:51.717
"So that's the pair 0, comma 0.",00:12:55.300,00:12:57.980
"So now we start to build up
some mathematics here, right?",00:12:57.980,00:13:00.590
"So we express the state
of this whole situation",00:13:00.590,00:13:04.380
by a pair of number.,00:13:04.380,00:13:05.980
"Now we need to find out
what they can do with it.",00:13:05.980,00:13:08.877
So what are the transitions?,00:13:08.877,00:13:10.043
"The transitions are,
as we have seen, right?",00:13:18.480,00:13:20.650
"We can just fill
one of the jugs.",00:13:20.650,00:13:22.830
We can empty those.,00:13:22.830,00:13:23.881
"And the other
possibility is that we",00:13:23.881,00:13:25.380
"can pour one jug over into the
other one as much as we can.",00:13:25.380,00:13:29.020
So let's write all of those out.,00:13:29.020,00:13:30.590
We can do emptying.,00:13:34.320,00:13:36.010
"Well, how does that
change the state?",00:13:36.010,00:13:38.080
"If we have x gallons
in this jug, and y--",00:13:40.820,00:13:44.850
"and y gallons in that one,
we can transition this into,",00:13:44.850,00:13:48.670
"for example, emptying
the a gallon jug.",00:13:48.670,00:13:51.420
So be y of 0.,00:13:51.420,00:13:53.540
Or we can empty the b jug.,00:13:53.540,00:14:00.262
"Well, filling is
something similar.",00:14:00.262,00:14:01.720
"But now we are actually pouring
more water from the fountain,",00:14:05.710,00:14:10.860
essentially.,00:14:10.860,00:14:11.430
Right?,00:14:11.430,00:14:11.930
All those tennis balls here.,00:14:11.930,00:14:13.930
"And we can fill up say the
a gallon up to a gallons,",00:14:13.930,00:14:20.430
and leave the b jug as it is.,00:14:20.430,00:14:23.410
"Or w we can fill up the b gallon
jug, and leave the a gallon jug",00:14:23.410,00:14:30.410
as it is.,00:14:30.410,00:14:32.520
"So these are these
two transitions.",00:14:32.520,00:14:34.670
And the pouring of one--,00:14:34.670,00:14:39.025
"of one jug into the
other is actually",00:14:39.025,00:14:41.370
a little bit more complex.,00:14:41.370,00:14:42.570
So let's have a look.,00:14:42.570,00:14:43.850
So how does pouring work?,00:14:47.370,00:14:49.770
"Well, suppose we
start with x and y.",00:14:49.770,00:14:55.000
So let's have a look here.,00:14:55.000,00:14:57.562
"Um, I don't know.",00:14:57.562,00:14:58.270
"Suppose we have 2 balls in
here, and 2 balls in here.",00:14:58.270,00:15:02.450
"Well, in that case, I can say
pour all of these over in here.",00:15:02.450,00:15:06.400
Right?,00:15:06.400,00:15:07.670
So that's easy.,00:15:07.670,00:15:08.930
"But there's also another
possibility, better",00:15:08.930,00:15:11.920
"when I pour all of
these over in here.",00:15:11.920,00:15:13.840
"But hey, I can
only put in 1 ball,",00:15:13.840,00:15:16.340
"because it's only
a three gallon jug.",00:15:16.340,00:15:19.000
So I'm left with only 1.,00:15:19.000,00:15:22.170
A gallon in this jug.,00:15:22.170,00:15:25.410
So these are two--,00:15:25.410,00:15:27.110
"these are two situations
that we need to explain.",00:15:27.110,00:15:30.080
"So let's first do the first
example that I just did.",00:15:30.080,00:15:34.400
"I pour everything over
into the other jug.",00:15:34.400,00:15:37.210
"So we have 0 gallons
left in here,",00:15:37.210,00:15:41.440
"and x plus y gallons
left in the other jug.",00:15:41.440,00:15:45.800
"And this can happen if there's
sufficient space, right?",00:15:45.800,00:15:50.160
"So this can only happen
if x plus y is at most b.",00:15:50.160,00:15:55.320
"Which is the capacity
of this b gallon jug.",00:15:55.320,00:15:59.530
"Now if that's not
the case, then I",00:15:59.530,00:16:01.170
"can pour in just a little
bit, like just say 1 ball.",00:16:01.170,00:16:04.680
"Like just one of
these can go in here.",00:16:04.680,00:16:08.480
So that's the other case.,00:16:08.480,00:16:10.090
"So x, y we'll actually go to--",00:16:10.090,00:16:16.450
"well, let's just
see how this works.",00:16:16.450,00:16:19.580
"How many gallons are left in
this b gallon jug to fill up?",00:16:19.580,00:16:25.260
"Well, we have b minus
y gallons left, right?",00:16:25.260,00:16:28.600
Space left.,00:16:28.600,00:16:30.080
"So we can take b minus y
gallons out of this one",00:16:30.080,00:16:33.790
to fill up this one.,00:16:33.790,00:16:35.410
So let's do it.,00:16:35.410,00:16:37.170
"We take b minus y
gets out of the a jug,",00:16:37.170,00:16:42.580
"and put it all in here, and it
makes it completely filled up.",00:16:42.580,00:16:46.300
So we have b gallons over here.,00:16:46.300,00:16:48.800
"So this is really equal to
x plus y minus b, comma b.",00:16:48.800,00:16:56.350
And this only is possible if--,00:16:56.350,00:17:01.200
"if you are essentially in
the complimentary case.",00:17:01.200,00:17:05.119
"So we have that x
plus y is at least b,",00:17:05.119,00:17:12.980
"such that there is enough
gallons in the a jug",00:17:12.980,00:17:19.720
"to be poured over to
fill up the b jug.",00:17:19.720,00:17:22.460
"So these are the
two kinds of cases.",00:17:22.460,00:17:24.430
"And, of course,
by symmetry we can",00:17:24.430,00:17:26.180
"do also the pouring from the
other jug into the first.",00:17:26.180,00:17:29.830
"So let's write all
those out, as well.",00:17:29.830,00:17:32.650
"So x, y can actually go
to x plus y, comma 0.",00:17:32.650,00:17:38.530
"I pour everything
from here to there.",00:17:38.530,00:17:41.750
"And this only holds if
x plus y is at most a.",00:17:41.750,00:17:47.435
"The other possibility is
where, exactly as in this case,",00:17:54.970,00:17:59.720
"we can only pour a minus
x gallons over from y",00:17:59.720,00:18:06.170
into this particular jug.,00:18:06.170,00:18:08.220
"And then this one is
completely filled up.",00:18:08.220,00:18:10.300
"And then I have a few
gallons left over here.",00:18:10.300,00:18:12.740
So how does that look?,00:18:12.740,00:18:14.910
"Well, we completely fill
this up to its capacity.",00:18:14.910,00:18:21.460
"And what is left
this is y minus--",00:18:21.460,00:18:24.210
"how much did we have
to pour in here?",00:18:24.210,00:18:26.990
"Well, that's a minus x.",00:18:26.990,00:18:31.180
"And we again have
a similar formula.",00:18:31.180,00:18:34.920
"But it now looks a
little bit different.",00:18:34.920,00:18:36.870
X plus y minus a.,00:18:36.870,00:18:38.720
"And this is only for the case
where x plus y is at least a.",00:18:38.720,00:18:45.060
OK.,00:18:47.891,00:18:48.390
So these are all the cases.,00:18:48.390,00:18:50.050
"So maybe there are some
questions about this.",00:18:50.050,00:18:52.990
"Is this clear, that we have
these different possibilities?",00:18:52.990,00:18:56.940
"Like when we look at
these jugs we can either",00:18:56.940,00:18:59.090
"empty them, filling them up.",00:18:59.090,00:19:00.840
"Or we can pour say
only 1 ball over up",00:19:00.840,00:19:04.260
"to the full capacity
of this jug.",00:19:04.260,00:19:05.940
"Or we can just pour everything
over into, say, this jug.",00:19:05.940,00:19:09.660
"So those are the different cases
that are now fully described",00:19:09.660,00:19:12.660
by this state machine.,00:19:12.660,00:19:14.380
"So now we can start to prove
this theorem over here.",00:19:14.380,00:19:18.100
So how do we go ahead?,00:19:18.100,00:19:20.410
"How are we going to use what
you've learned like induction,",00:19:20.410,00:19:24.100
and invariance?,00:19:24.100,00:19:25.660
So let's do it.,00:19:25.660,00:19:27.880
"But before,
actually, we do this,",00:19:27.880,00:19:30.470
"let's take this
example that we had",00:19:30.470,00:19:34.940
"and see how we can describe all
the transitions that we just",00:19:34.940,00:19:39.088
"did, as far as I remember them.",00:19:39.088,00:19:41.920
"So we have that a
equals 3, b equals 5.",00:19:41.920,00:19:45.850
Right?,00:19:45.850,00:19:47.320
We start with empty jugs.,00:19:47.320,00:19:51.760
"We need to filled up the
five gallon jug, right?",00:19:51.760,00:19:54.980
"Then we started pouring
the five gallon jug as much",00:19:59.060,00:20:03.330
"as we could into the
three gallon jug.",00:20:03.330,00:20:05.240
So it's one of those rules.,00:20:05.240,00:20:07.100
We've got 3 into 2.,00:20:07.100,00:20:09.860
"Then we emptied the
three gallon jug.",00:20:09.860,00:20:13.080
We got 0 and 2.,00:20:13.080,00:20:14.330
Then we did--,00:20:16.940,00:20:18.730
What did we did next?,00:20:18.730,00:20:20.070
"Oh yeah, we poured
everything into this one.",00:20:20.070,00:20:24.750
"So we have 2, 0
as the next state.",00:20:24.750,00:20:28.890
"We filled up-- actually I
forgot exactly what we did next.",00:20:28.890,00:20:35.550
"But I think we filled
up the five gallon jug.",00:20:35.550,00:20:40.790
"And then we simply
poured over as much",00:20:40.790,00:20:43.170
"as he could from
the five gallon jug.",00:20:43.170,00:20:45.400
"And we got 3 and
4, and here we are.",00:20:45.400,00:20:49.040
We got 4 gallons.,00:20:49.040,00:20:51.440
"So what we just did is fully
describe this state machine.",00:20:51.440,00:20:55.265
"So let's not try to
prove this theorem.",00:20:55.265,00:20:56.890
"So as I said, we're
going to use induction.",00:21:02.769,00:21:04.560
"So you always would
like to write this out",00:21:09.660,00:21:13.840
if you solve your problems.,00:21:13.840,00:21:15.085
What are we going to assume?,00:21:17.880,00:21:19.810
"Well, we assume actually
that m defines a,",00:21:19.810,00:21:25.170
and m defines also b.,00:21:25.170,00:21:27.919
"That's the assumption
of the theorem,",00:21:27.919,00:21:29.460
"and now we need to prove that
defies any result that you can",00:21:29.460,00:21:32.880
achieve in this state machine.,00:21:32.880,00:21:36.340
"So what's the invariance
that we are thinking about?",00:21:36.340,00:21:39.560
Invariance is going to be--,00:21:43.090,00:21:44.600
Oops.,00:21:47.401,00:21:47.900
It's a predicate.,00:21:50.890,00:21:53.530
"And it says something
like, if the state xy--",00:21:53.530,00:22:00.000
"if this is the state
after n transitions--",00:22:00.000,00:22:03.605
"Then we would like to conclude
that m the fights both x,",00:22:14.300,00:22:20.900
and m defines y.,00:22:20.900,00:22:23.220
So this is our--,00:22:23.220,00:22:25.910
our invariance.,00:22:25.910,00:22:27.150
"And we like to use this
to prove our theorem.",00:22:27.150,00:22:29.690
"So how do we start
usually, right?",00:22:29.690,00:22:31.280
So we always start with--,00:22:31.280,00:22:33.250
with a base state.,00:22:33.250,00:22:34.500
Great.,00:22:34.500,00:22:35.690
So let's do it.,00:22:35.690,00:22:36.880
The base case is--,00:22:40.690,00:22:43.660
"well, we start with the all
0s, like the empty jugs.",00:22:43.660,00:22:49.400
"It's-- well, and we also--",00:22:49.400,00:22:52.390
"have paid a little
bit of extra attention",00:22:52.390,00:22:54.160
"to what we mean by
division over here.",00:22:54.160,00:22:56.120
"We said that all integers
actually divide 0.",00:22:56.120,00:23:00.400
"So in particular,
m. m divides 0.",00:23:00.400,00:23:02.790
"m, 0.",00:23:02.790,00:23:04.450
"So the very initial
state, 0 comma 0,",00:23:04.450,00:23:07.790
"is indeed complying to
is particular invariant.",00:23:07.790,00:23:13.760
So let's write it out.,00:23:13.760,00:23:16.070
"So we have the
initial state 0, 0.",00:23:16.070,00:23:19.000
We know that m divides 0.,00:23:19.000,00:23:21.360
"And therefore, we
know that p 0 is true.",00:23:21.360,00:23:27.060
So that's great.,00:23:27.060,00:23:28.920
So the inductive step.,00:23:28.920,00:23:31.380
"How do we start the
inductive step--",00:23:31.380,00:23:33.380
step all the time?,00:23:33.380,00:23:34.720
"And we will assume,
actually, p of n, right?",00:23:38.720,00:23:42.420
So lets assume that.,00:23:42.420,00:23:45.230
"And now we would like to
prove p, and then n plus 1.",00:23:45.230,00:23:51.310
So what do we really want to do?,00:23:51.310,00:23:53.620
"We want to say, well, we know
that we reached a certain state",00:23:53.620,00:23:57.910
"x comma y, for which m
divides x, and m divides y.",00:23:57.910,00:24:03.810
"Now we would like to show
that if we transition",00:24:03.810,00:24:06.370
"to a next state, we again have
that same property, that m",00:24:06.370,00:24:10.050
"divides the number of gallons
in both jugs once more.",00:24:10.050,00:24:14.820
And then we can con--,00:24:14.820,00:24:16.200
"can conclude p, n plus 1.",00:24:16.200,00:24:17.700
So that's how we always proceed.,00:24:17.700,00:24:21.020
"So let's see where
we can write it out",00:24:21.020,00:24:22.900
in a bit more formal way.,00:24:22.900,00:24:24.330
OK.,00:24:29.121,00:24:29.620
So how do we go ahead?,00:24:29.620,00:24:33.270
"Suppose that x, y is the
state after n transitions.",00:24:33.270,00:24:45.175
"Well, what can we conclude?",00:24:50.350,00:24:53.150
"Well, we have the predicate
pn, the invariant.",00:24:53.150,00:24:57.160
"So we know that n divides
x, and n divides y.",00:24:57.160,00:25:06.390
"And we concluded that
because pn is true.",00:25:06.390,00:25:08.780
So after another transition--,00:25:13.320,00:25:14.900
"what happens after
another transition?",00:25:14.900,00:25:17.580
"So we can conclude
that the jugs are",00:25:17.580,00:25:25.280
"filled by the different
types of numbers",00:25:25.280,00:25:30.625
"that we see here this
is state machine.",00:25:30.625,00:25:32.840
So let's write them out.,00:25:32.840,00:25:34.660
"So after another transition,
um, each of the jugs",00:25:34.660,00:25:44.060
is actually filled--,00:25:44.060,00:25:45.890
"Um, are filled with--",00:25:45.890,00:25:52.840
"well, either if I've emptied
it, say a 0, 0 gallons, a, b, x",00:25:52.840,00:26:01.360
and y.,00:26:01.360,00:26:01.990
I see appearing over here.,00:26:01.990,00:26:04.060
"And I also notice
that I see x plus y.",00:26:04.060,00:26:06.810
"And x plus y, minus b.",00:26:06.810,00:26:08.330
"And x plus y, minus a.",00:26:08.330,00:26:09.980
"Those are all the
different number",00:26:09.980,00:26:11.740
of gallons that can be in jug.,00:26:11.740,00:26:13.040
"Yes, please?",00:26:13.040,00:26:14.161
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:26:14.161,00:26:15.604
PROFESSOR: In our example--,00:26:18.490,00:26:19.680
"Yeah, that's a good question.",00:26:19.680,00:26:20.888
"So in our example
problems of 3 and 5,",00:26:20.888,00:26:23.450
"it turns out that
the only number that",00:26:23.450,00:26:26.480
"divides 5 both the three gallon
jug, and the five gallon jugs",00:26:26.480,00:26:29.765
is actually one.,00:26:29.765,00:26:31.390
"So in our example, we
would have that m equals 1.",00:26:31.390,00:26:35.790
"So over here we have
that only 1 divides a,",00:26:35.790,00:26:44.330
as well as 1 divides b.,00:26:44.330,00:26:47.030
So m equals 1 in our case.,00:26:47.030,00:26:49.800
"But for example, in the three
gallon jug, and the six gallon",00:26:49.800,00:26:53.240
jug--,00:26:53.240,00:26:53.770
Right?,00:26:53.770,00:26:54.650
"We have that m equals 3, like
3 divides 3, And 3 divides 6.",00:26:54.650,00:27:01.320
"So those are the two cases that
you sort of look at right now.",00:27:01.320,00:27:04.630
"But you put into a much
more general setting, right,",00:27:04.630,00:27:06.870
"we are distracted away
from the actual numbers.",00:27:06.870,00:27:09.270
"And use a and b as
representations.",00:27:09.270,00:27:13.355
Are any other questions?,00:27:15.950,00:27:19.130
"So after another
transition, each of the jugs",00:27:19.130,00:27:22.790
"are filled with, well,
either 0 gallons, if we",00:27:22.790,00:27:25.890
have a completely emptied them.,00:27:25.890,00:27:28.120
"Or we have filled the first
a gallon jug, or it can be b.",00:27:28.120,00:27:33.170
We also noticed that it can be--,00:27:33.170,00:27:36.040
"it can be of x, of course.",00:27:36.040,00:27:37.650
"It can be y, because that's
the state that we are in.",00:27:37.650,00:27:41.610
"And we can have x plus y, minus
a, which appears over here.",00:27:41.610,00:27:47.950
"And x plus y, minus b.",00:27:47.950,00:27:49.570
"So these are all the
different number--",00:27:53.770,00:27:55.550
possible number of gallons.,00:27:58.175,00:27:59.300
The x plus y.,00:28:02.262,00:28:04.280
That's also present.,00:28:04.280,00:28:06.520
Is that true?,00:28:06.520,00:28:08.473
Yeah.,00:28:08.473,00:28:08.973
That's right. x plus y.,00:28:08.973,00:28:10.370
So we also have x plus y.,00:28:10.370,00:28:13.280
"Actually, it's good
to check that again.",00:28:13.280,00:28:14.980
"So we have 0, x, y, a, b.",00:28:14.980,00:28:18.340
Got those.,00:28:18.340,00:28:19.280
"X plus y, and x plus y, minus
p, and x plus y minus b.",00:28:19.280,00:28:24.090
Yeah.,00:28:24.090,00:28:26.090
So now we can start using our--,00:28:26.090,00:28:29.860
our assumptions.,00:28:29.860,00:28:32.120
So what our they?,00:28:32.120,00:28:33.600
"We have that in order
to prove this-- right?",00:28:33.600,00:28:36.980
"At the top over here, we assume
that m divides, and m divides",00:28:36.980,00:28:40.980
b.,00:28:40.980,00:28:42.420
"So we know that first of
all, m divides 0, of course.",00:28:42.420,00:28:46.900
But we know that m divides a.,00:28:46.900,00:28:49.460
We know that m divides b.,00:28:49.460,00:28:52.000
"We have concluded
that m divides x.",00:28:52.000,00:28:54.970
And also m divides y.,00:28:54.970,00:28:56.370
"So if you now use some
facts about divisibility",00:28:58.980,00:29:02.790
"on your handout, which
we will not prove now.",00:29:02.790,00:29:05.770
"But I think most of them will be
on your problem set, actually.",00:29:05.770,00:29:10.520
"We can conclude that also linear
combination of a, b x and y",00:29:10.520,00:29:16.270
will be divisible by m.,00:29:16.270,00:29:18.660
"In particular, m
will divide x plus y.",00:29:18.660,00:29:21.850
"m will divide x plus y minus
a, and also x plus y, minus b.",00:29:21.850,00:29:26.400
"So we will conclude
that m actually",00:29:26.400,00:29:34.040
divides any possible results.,00:29:34.040,00:29:37.960
So divides any of the above.,00:29:37.960,00:29:41.680
And now we're done.,00:29:41.680,00:29:44.380
Why is that?,00:29:44.380,00:29:45.120
"Because we have shown now that
after the next transition--",00:29:45.120,00:29:48.510
"after we have reached
x, y after n steps,",00:29:48.510,00:29:52.870
"then in our n plus 1-th step,
all that you can achieve",00:29:52.870,00:29:58.980
is divisible by m.,00:29:58.980,00:30:01.180
"So that's exactly
the invariance.",00:30:01.180,00:30:03.810
"So we conclude that
p, n plus 1 is true.",00:30:03.810,00:30:08.620
And so now we're done.,00:30:08.620,00:30:09.600
"Are any questions
about this proof?",00:30:12.230,00:30:14.900
"So this is like the
standard technique",00:30:14.900,00:30:16.540
"that we tried to use all
the time here in this class.",00:30:16.540,00:30:20.200
"We will use it in all
the other areas, as well.",00:30:20.200,00:30:22.850
"In graph theory, in particular.",00:30:22.850,00:30:26.440
"And especially in number
theory, will also use it,",00:30:26.440,00:30:30.430
especially in this class.,00:30:30.430,00:30:33.220
OK.,00:30:33.220,00:30:33.720
So let's apply this to theorem.,00:30:33.720,00:30:36.660
"Let's I think about
this movie that we saw,",00:30:39.870,00:30:43.790
this Die Hard number 3.,00:30:43.790,00:30:46.150
Die Hard number 4 came out.,00:30:46.150,00:30:48.120
"And then the cast got
stuck in Die Hard number 5.",00:30:48.120,00:30:51.890
"There's was a problem,
because the rumors",00:30:51.890,00:30:55.730
"were that in Die Hard number 5,
they had like a 33 gallon jug.",00:30:55.730,00:31:01.810
That's a lot.,00:31:01.810,00:31:02.760
And a 55 gallon jug.,00:31:02.760,00:31:05.680
"So Bruce has in
training his muscles,",00:31:05.680,00:31:13.252
"because you can imagine
those are pretty heavy.",00:31:13.252,00:31:15.210
"So if you want the pour one
into the other, my goodness.",00:31:15.210,00:31:17.560
"So-- but the question is, is
he training the right muscles?",00:31:17.560,00:31:22.810
"So can we apply this theorem
now, and showed that--",00:31:22.810,00:31:27.450
"Oh, I should to tell
you what is the problem.",00:31:27.450,00:31:31.100
"Well, again, he has to
get say 4 gallons out",00:31:31.100,00:31:35.980
of this-- out of these two jugs.,00:31:35.980,00:31:39.750
So is that possible?,00:31:39.750,00:31:42.260
It's not.,00:31:42.260,00:31:42.760
I see someone shaking his head.,00:31:42.760,00:31:44.280
Do you want to explain why?,00:31:44.280,00:31:48.030
"AUDIENCE: A and b are
both divisible by 11.",00:31:48.030,00:31:50.874
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:31:50.874,00:31:51.540
"AUDIENCE: So any other
configuration will also",00:31:51.540,00:31:54.640
have to be divisible by 11.,00:31:54.640,00:31:56.360
And 4 is not divisible by 11.,00:31:56.360,00:31:58.590
PROFESSOR: Exactly.,00:31:58.590,00:31:59.810
"4 is not divisible by 11, so
the whole cast got blown up",00:31:59.810,00:32:02.540
in Die Hard number 5.,00:32:02.540,00:32:04.310
"And so we have no Die
Hard number 6, as well.",00:32:04.310,00:32:08.510
"OK, so-- so now
all of this stuff",00:32:08.510,00:32:13.520
"actually helps us to define
a new concept, as well.",00:32:13.520,00:32:17.860
So let's do that.,00:32:17.860,00:32:20.580
I'll put it up here.,00:32:20.580,00:32:21.485
"We will use the
terminology GCD of a and b",00:32:29.630,00:32:42.770
"as being the greatest
common divisor of a and b.",00:32:42.770,00:32:59.530
"So, for example, if we
are looking at a equals 3,",00:32:59.530,00:33:04.380
"and b equals 5, well
then the GCD of 3 and 5",00:33:04.380,00:33:11.030
is actually equal to 1.,00:33:11.030,00:33:13.360
"There's no other larger integer
that divides both 3 and 5.",00:33:13.360,00:33:20.450
"In other examples are, for
example, if we have the GCD of",00:33:20.450,00:33:25.250
say 52 and 44.,00:33:25.250,00:33:29.410
"Well, what's this equal to?",00:33:29.410,00:33:31.550
"Well, this actually
is 4 times 13.",00:33:31.550,00:33:35.630
This is 4 times 11.,00:33:35.630,00:33:38.170
"So 4 divides both this,
and both this one.",00:33:38.170,00:33:41.350
"But nothing larger can
divide both of those.",00:33:41.350,00:33:44.220
"So we have that
this is equal to 4.",00:33:44.220,00:33:45.940
"We will have a
separate definition",00:33:49.330,00:33:52.110
"that talks about this
very special case where",00:33:52.110,00:33:54.650
two numbers--,00:33:54.650,00:33:56.270
"if you look at their
greatest common divisor--",00:33:56.270,00:33:59.630
"when that greatest common
divisor is equal to 1,",00:33:59.630,00:34:02.445
"we actually define
those two numbers",00:34:02.445,00:34:04.240
"to be relatively
prime to one another.",00:34:04.240,00:34:08.310
So let's put that out over here.,00:34:08.310,00:34:10.979
So that's another definition.,00:34:20.550,00:34:23.630
"We say that a and
b are relatively",00:34:23.630,00:34:28.929
"prime if the greatest common
divisor is actually equal to 1.",00:34:28.929,00:34:39.610
"Now today we will not really
use his definition so much,",00:34:42.840,00:34:45.810
"but it's actually
very important.",00:34:45.810,00:34:47.510
"And we'll come back
to this next lecture.",00:34:47.510,00:34:49.714
"So if we now look at this
particular thing them",00:34:53.520,00:34:56.600
"over here, can we see a
nice corollary of this?",00:34:56.600,00:35:02.490
"Like a result, if you
think about this greatest",00:35:02.490,00:35:04.460
common divisor.,00:35:04.460,00:35:06.160
"Well, the greatest
common divisor off a an b",00:35:06.160,00:35:09.200
divides both a and b.,00:35:09.200,00:35:11.670
"So the greatest common
divisor of a and b",00:35:11.670,00:35:14.080
"will divide any result that
we can generate by playing",00:35:14.080,00:35:18.930
this game with the jugs.,00:35:18.930,00:35:20.650
"So the corollary here is
that the GCD of a and b",00:35:20.650,00:35:28.060
divides any result.,00:35:28.060,00:35:31.751
"OK, so that's really cool.",00:35:34.440,00:35:37.200
"So this already tells us
quite a bit about this game",00:35:37.200,00:35:40.950
that we have here.,00:35:40.950,00:35:42.590
"So now what we would
like to do is to find out",00:35:42.590,00:35:46.830
what exactly we can be reached?,00:35:46.830,00:35:49.050
"We have a property that
we have shown here.",00:35:49.050,00:35:51.760
But what else can we do here?,00:35:51.760,00:35:55.300
"Now it turns out that
you can say much more,",00:35:55.300,00:35:58.640
"and we would like to prove the
following theorem to make--",00:35:58.640,00:36:03.330
"to analyze this whole
thing much better.",00:36:03.330,00:36:05.920
"I don't think I need the
state machine anymore.",00:36:05.920,00:36:09.400
So let's take that off.,00:36:09.400,00:36:10.709
"The theorem that we
would like to prove",00:36:19.810,00:36:21.580
"is that any linear
combination of the-- let's",00:36:21.580,00:36:29.022
"change this into
the 3 and 5 again.",00:36:29.022,00:36:32.210
"Any linear combination
of 3 and 5,",00:36:32.210,00:36:35.180
"I can make with these 3
and the 5 a gallon jug.",00:36:35.180,00:36:41.280
So let's write it out.,00:36:41.280,00:36:42.660
"So any linear
combination l, which",00:36:42.660,00:36:55.680
"we writes as some integer s
times a, plus some integer",00:36:55.680,00:37:01.330
t times b.,00:37:01.330,00:37:02.360
"So any linear combination
of a and b, with--",00:37:05.170,00:37:14.717
"well, of course, the
number of gallons",00:37:14.717,00:37:16.300
should fit the largest the jug.,00:37:16.300,00:37:19.850
"So with 0 is, at most l.",00:37:19.850,00:37:25.430
Is it mostly can be reached.,00:37:25.430,00:37:27.620
"So this theorem we
would like to prove now.",00:37:34.520,00:37:37.920
"And in order to
do that, we would",00:37:37.920,00:37:39.610
"like to already think about
some kind of a property",00:37:39.610,00:37:44.260
that we have.,00:37:44.260,00:37:45.250
"So when we talk about linear
combinations, the s and the t",00:37:45.250,00:37:49.090
"can be negative, or positive.",00:37:49.090,00:37:50.820
We really don't care.,00:37:50.820,00:37:51.760
"So for example, we could
have like, I don't know,",00:37:51.760,00:37:56.560
minus 2 times--,00:37:56.560,00:37:58.070
"so for example, 4 is equal
to minus 2, times 3, plus--",00:37:58.070,00:38:05.130
"actually, is that true?",00:38:05.130,00:38:06.140
Yeah.,00:38:06.140,00:38:06.820
"Plus 2, times 5.",00:38:06.820,00:38:10.590
"So here we have s to be equal
to minus 2, and t is equal to 2.",00:38:10.590,00:38:18.710
"And of course, a is
equal to 3, right?",00:38:18.710,00:38:20.430
And be is equal to 5.,00:38:20.430,00:38:23.210
"So 4 is a linear
combination of these two.",00:38:23.210,00:38:27.160
"And according to the theorem,
we can create that number",00:38:27.160,00:38:31.070
of gallons in this jug.,00:38:31.070,00:38:33.280
"And we already saw
that, because we did it.",00:38:33.280,00:38:36.480
"But for our theorem,
in order to prove this,",00:38:36.480,00:38:40.430
"we really would like
s to be positive.",00:38:40.430,00:38:43.020
So how can we do that?,00:38:43.020,00:38:45.390
"If anybody has an
indea what we could do?",00:38:45.390,00:38:48.150
"AUDIENCE: Let's assume
that b is greater than m.",00:38:48.150,00:38:51.224
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:38:51.224,00:38:51.890
"We have still that a
is supposed to be--",00:38:51.890,00:38:54.240
"We will assume that
throughout the whole lecture.",00:38:54.240,00:38:57.821
Thanks.,00:38:57.821,00:38:58.320
"So in order to prove
this, we really",00:39:00.731,00:39:02.230
"would like to have
s to be positive.",00:39:02.230,00:39:04.110
"So let's just play
around a little bit",00:39:04.110,00:39:05.867
"with linear combinations
to get a little bit",00:39:05.867,00:39:07.700
of feeling for that.,00:39:07.700,00:39:09.280
"How could we write
4 differently,",00:39:09.280,00:39:11.510
"as a linear
combination of 3 and 5,",00:39:11.510,00:39:14.150
"such that we have actually
a positive number over here?",00:39:14.150,00:39:19.150
"Does anybody see
another way to see that?",00:39:19.150,00:39:23.895
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:23.895,00:39:25.937
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's true.",00:39:25.937,00:39:27.145
"3 times 3, minus--",00:39:27.145,00:39:29.940
minus 5.,00:39:29.940,00:39:31.270
So-- and how did we do that?,00:39:31.270,00:39:33.460
"Well, we can just say
5 times 3 to this one,",00:39:33.460,00:39:38.580
"and then subtract the same
again, minus 3 times 5,",00:39:38.580,00:39:42.090
over here.,00:39:42.090,00:39:43.320
"And if he adds those
things together,",00:39:43.320,00:39:46.170
"he will see 5 minus 2, is
3 times 3, as you said.",00:39:46.170,00:39:50.870
"And we have minus 3 plus 2
is actually minus 1 times 5.",00:39:50.870,00:39:55.580
"And this will be a different
linear combination of 4.",00:39:55.580,00:39:58.900
"So what we can do here, we can
sort of play around and make",00:39:58.900,00:40:02.930
"this s over here, which we now
say call s prime, is positive.",00:40:02.930,00:40:07.260
"Actually, it's larger than 0.",00:40:10.200,00:40:11.640
"So let's start the
proof for this theorem.",00:40:17.340,00:40:22.960
"It's pretty amazing
to me, actually,",00:40:22.960,00:40:27.595
"that you can do so
much a game like this,",00:40:27.595,00:40:31.470
and see so much happening.,00:40:31.470,00:40:35.020
"So let's figure
out how this works.",00:40:35.020,00:40:40.651
OK.,00:40:40.651,00:40:41.150
"So let's first formalize this
particular trick over here.",00:40:45.300,00:40:51.850
And how do we go ahead with it?,00:40:51.850,00:40:54.030
"Ah, well, notice
that we can rewrite",00:40:54.030,00:40:59.990
"L, which is equal to s
times a, plus t times b.",00:40:59.990,00:41:05.780
"s, you know, we can just add
a multiple of b over here.",00:41:05.780,00:41:13.130
"n times b, say m times a.",00:41:13.130,00:41:16.880
"And we can subtract the
same amount over here,",00:41:16.880,00:41:22.140
"minus n times a, times b.",00:41:22.140,00:41:24.370
"So do you see what
I did over here?",00:41:24.370,00:41:26.530
"I have added n times b, times a,
and subtracted n, times a times",00:41:26.530,00:41:30.570
b.,00:41:30.570,00:41:32.760
"And we did something similar
over here, not exactly",00:41:32.760,00:41:35.140
the same.,00:41:35.140,00:41:35.750
But that's what we did.,00:41:35.750,00:41:37.990
"And you can imagine
that we can choose m,",00:41:37.990,00:41:42.390
"such that s plus n times
b will be larger than 0.",00:41:42.390,00:41:45.970
We can do that.,00:41:45.970,00:41:47.030
"So essentially this proved to
us that there exists an x prime,",00:41:47.030,00:41:53.450
"and also the t
prime, such that L",00:41:53.450,00:41:57.050
"can be rewritten as
a linear combination,",00:41:57.050,00:41:59.610
"s prime, times a,
plus t prime, times b.",00:41:59.610,00:42:04.600
"But now with you extra
property, that s prime",00:42:04.600,00:42:08.710
is actually positive.,00:42:08.710,00:42:13.010
"Now this is really
important, because we're",00:42:13.010,00:42:15.690
"going to create an
algorithm of playing",00:42:15.690,00:42:18.840
"with those jugs that can
achieve this particular linear",00:42:18.840,00:42:22.410
combination.,00:42:22.410,00:42:23.280
"And that's how we're going
to prove this theorem.",00:42:23.280,00:42:26.700
"So let's assume that 0 is
less than L, is less than b.",00:42:26.700,00:42:36.215
"I know that we, in
the theorem, we also",00:42:36.215,00:42:39.690
"consider the case is L
equals 0, and L equals b.",00:42:39.690,00:42:42.472
"But those are obvious, right?",00:42:42.472,00:42:43.680
"You could either empty
the jugs, or just",00:42:43.680,00:42:46.020
fill up with the bigger one.,00:42:46.020,00:42:49.130
"So we will consider
just this case.",00:42:49.130,00:42:51.260
All right.,00:42:54.580,00:42:55.080
"So what's the algorithm
going to do for us?",00:42:55.080,00:42:57.243
"The algorithm is going to
repeatedly fill and pour",00:43:03.159,00:43:12.740
our jugs in a very special way.,00:43:12.740,00:43:16.160
"And miraculously we
will be able to get",00:43:16.160,00:43:20.470
"the desired linear
combination every single time.",00:43:20.470,00:43:23.520
"And of course, we're going
to use induction again",00:43:26.229,00:43:28.270
to prove this property.,00:43:28.270,00:43:30.611
OK.,00:43:30.611,00:43:31.110
So how does the algorithm work?,00:43:31.110,00:43:33.330
"Well, to obtain L gallons
we're going to repeat",00:43:33.330,00:43:45.980
"s prime times, which is the
number that we have over here.",00:43:45.980,00:43:50.047
"The following algorithm--
we first of all,",00:43:53.320,00:44:00.260
we will fill the a jug.,00:44:00.260,00:44:02.160
This one.,00:44:06.800,00:44:08.609
"After we have done
this, we are going",00:44:08.609,00:44:10.150
to pour this into the b jug.,00:44:10.150,00:44:12.380
So how do we go ahead?,00:44:12.380,00:44:15.090
We pour- oops.,00:44:15.090,00:44:18.470
This into the b jug.,00:44:18.470,00:44:19.615
"And when this b jug becomes
full, we are going pour it out.",00:44:23.450,00:44:28.960
So let's write it out.,00:44:28.960,00:44:31.040
"So when it becomes full, it
will actually empty it out.",00:44:31.040,00:44:45.080
"And we will continue pouring
the a jug into the b jug.",00:44:49.080,00:44:53.610
So we'll continue this process.,00:44:53.610,00:44:56.060
"So let's take an example
to see how that works.",00:45:00.120,00:45:04.060
"So we keep on doing this until
the a jug is actually empty.",00:45:04.060,00:45:10.680
So let's take an example.,00:45:13.920,00:45:15.070
So let's see.,00:45:18.436,00:45:20.890
Let's do that over here.,00:45:20.890,00:45:22.555
"Actually we can do
the tennis balls, too.",00:45:26.560,00:45:29.960
Let's do that first.,00:45:29.960,00:45:32.100
See how that works.,00:45:32.100,00:45:34.810
"So essentially, in
order to get 4 gallons,",00:45:34.810,00:45:41.510
"we just fill up the
three gallon jug.",00:45:41.510,00:45:45.100
We empty it all in here.,00:45:45.100,00:45:47.230
We fill it up again.,00:45:49.780,00:45:51.670
You pour in as much as we can.,00:45:51.670,00:45:54.110
That's-- that's it.,00:45:54.110,00:45:56.480
We have to empty this one.,00:45:56.480,00:45:58.501
Oops.,00:45:58.501,00:45:59.000
We have to keep on pouring.,00:46:01.760,00:46:04.040
Put this in here.,00:46:04.040,00:46:05.740
"Fill this one up, and then pour
over into the five gallon jug.",00:46:05.740,00:46:12.900
"And now we've got 4
gallons over here.",00:46:12.900,00:46:15.640
So what did we do?,00:46:15.640,00:46:17.160
So let's write it out.,00:46:17.160,00:46:19.490
"So for our special linear
combination over here,",00:46:19.490,00:46:23.180
"we have that 4 equals 3,
times 3, minus 1, times 5.",00:46:23.180,00:46:29.040
"So we need to repeat
this process three times.",00:46:29.040,00:46:33.620
So let's do that.,00:46:33.620,00:46:35.740
"In our first loop we
will do the following.",00:46:35.740,00:46:42.150
"We start with the start
state, the pair 0, 0.",00:46:42.150,00:46:47.490
"We're going to fill up the
very first jug all the way up",00:46:47.490,00:46:50.720
"to its capacity, 3.",00:46:50.720,00:46:52.950
"And we put it all
over into the b jug.",00:46:52.950,00:46:57.860
What happens in the second loop?,00:46:57.860,00:46:59.414
"The second loop, we
again fill up the a jug.",00:47:04.850,00:47:09.200
"So we have-- we start at 0, 3.",00:47:09.200,00:47:13.320
We fill it up.,00:47:13.320,00:47:15.730
"We get 3, 3, the pair 3, 3.",00:47:15.730,00:47:18.430
"We pour everything in
here, as much as we can.",00:47:18.430,00:47:22.330
"That give us 1, 5.",00:47:22.330,00:47:24.320
"Only 2 gallons are poured
into the bigger gallon.",00:47:24.320,00:47:29.180
"We empty the bigger
gallon, the bigger jug.",00:47:29.180,00:47:32.230
"We get 1, 0.",00:47:32.230,00:47:34.940
"And we keep on pouring,
and you get 0, 1.",00:47:34.940,00:47:39.110
So now in the third loop--,00:47:39.110,00:47:41.070
"and that's where we
should get the 4 gallons.",00:47:41.070,00:47:43.276
"We start off with 0,1.",00:47:47.110,00:47:51.440
"Um, we fill up the a jug.",00:47:51.440,00:47:57.150
"We pour everything over into
the bigger jug, and we get 0, 4.",00:47:57.150,00:48:03.910
And that's the end result.,00:48:03.910,00:48:06.210
"So this algorithm seems to work
for this particular example.",00:48:06.210,00:48:09.970
"Of course we would like to prove
it for the general situation.",00:48:09.970,00:48:13.489
So how do we do it?,00:48:13.489,00:48:14.280
"Well, we're going to just
to analyze the algorithm",00:48:16.800,00:48:22.780
in the following way.,00:48:22.780,00:48:23.660
"We can notice that
in this algorithm,",00:48:27.000,00:48:32.530
"we fill up s prime
times the a jug,",00:48:32.530,00:48:36.020
"and we essentially pour
everything out into the b jugs,",00:48:36.020,00:48:42.420
"and we sometimes
empty the b jug.",00:48:42.420,00:48:45.660
"So let's try to think
about this a little bit,",00:48:45.660,00:48:48.170
"and see how we could
try to formalize this.",00:48:48.170,00:48:51.030
So let's write it out.,00:48:51.030,00:48:52.160
"We have filled the a
gallon jug s prime times.",00:48:54.700,00:49:02.720
"We also know that the
b jug has been emptied",00:49:05.360,00:49:09.500
a certain number of times.,00:49:09.500,00:49:10.880
So let's-- let's just assume--,00:49:10.880,00:49:15.510
"suppose that the b jug is
actually emptied, say, u times.",00:49:15.510,00:49:24.375
I do not know how many times.,00:49:30.700,00:49:32.800
"But I say, well, let's
assume it's u times,",00:49:32.800,00:49:34.900
"and try to figure
out whether we can",00:49:34.900,00:49:37.340
find some algebraic expression.,00:49:37.340,00:49:40.470
"So at the very end
of the algorithm,",00:49:40.470,00:49:44.690
let r be what is in the b jug.,00:49:44.690,00:49:48.270
"So let r be the remainder,
in the b gallon jug.",00:49:48.270,00:49:58.235
So now we can continue.,00:50:03.500,00:50:06.220
"We know if r is what left
in the b gallon jug, well,",00:50:06.220,00:50:09.940
"we know already
some property of it.",00:50:09.940,00:50:13.780
"Actually, let's put
that on the next board.",00:50:13.780,00:50:17.040
"We know that 0 is at
most r, and at most b,",00:50:17.040,00:50:22.580
"because that's what's left
in the b gallon jug, right?",00:50:22.580,00:50:25.170
So we know these bounds.,00:50:25.170,00:50:27.740
"We have assumed that 0 is
less than L, is less than b,",00:50:27.740,00:50:33.700
which we put over there.,00:50:33.700,00:50:36.620
"We know that r must
be equal to what",00:50:36.620,00:50:40.650
"kind of linear combination
of s prime, and u?",00:50:40.650,00:50:46.720
"So-- Well, we have been
filling of s prime times.",00:50:46.720,00:50:52.240
"So this is what we added in
water to the whole system,",00:50:52.240,00:50:57.020
"you can say, s prime times a.",00:50:57.020,00:50:59.660
And we poured out water.,00:50:59.660,00:51:02.060
"Well, we did that u times
from the b gallon jug.",00:51:02.060,00:51:06.890
"So we poured out
u times b gallons.",00:51:06.890,00:51:09.830
"So this is the remainder that
this left in this bigger jug,",00:51:09.830,00:51:13.520
right?,00:51:13.520,00:51:14.910
"So are there any
questions about this?",00:51:14.910,00:51:17.940
So-- OK.,00:51:17.940,00:51:22.150
"So we also know that
L is equal to s prime,",00:51:22.150,00:51:27.470
"times a, plus t prime, times b.",00:51:27.470,00:51:31.220
"And this is the
linear combination",00:51:31.220,00:51:33.500
"that we would try
to prove of, that it",00:51:33.500,00:51:36.820
is left at the very end.,00:51:36.820,00:51:39.240
"So what we want to show
is that r equals L.",00:51:39.240,00:51:42.440
So how do we do that now?,00:51:42.440,00:51:44.290
"How are we going to show
that r can be expressed",00:51:44.290,00:51:51.110
"in L, in a special way.",00:51:51.110,00:51:52.770
So let's have a look.,00:51:52.770,00:51:53.710
"So these are all
tricks in the sense",00:51:53.710,00:51:58.150
"that I'm giving you
this proof, but how do",00:51:58.150,00:52:01.000
you come up with this yourself?,00:52:01.000,00:52:03.340
"Sometimes you play a lot
with these kinds of things,",00:52:03.340,00:52:05.990
"and you get a feeling
of what kind of--",00:52:05.990,00:52:11.070
"sort of pattern exists,
and what kind of intuition",00:52:11.070,00:52:16.080
"you need in order to write
down a proof like this.",00:52:16.080,00:52:19.070
So let's rewrite this.,00:52:19.070,00:52:22.910
I'm going add t prime times b.,00:52:22.910,00:52:26.030
"And I'm going to
subtract it again.",00:52:26.030,00:52:27.570
"So I have s prime times
a, plus t prime times b.",00:52:30.530,00:52:34.650
"I subtract it again, and I
still have this amount left open",00:52:34.650,00:52:38.240
here.,00:52:38.240,00:52:39.820
So what is this equal to?,00:52:39.820,00:52:41.755
"Well this part is equal to L.
So this is equal to minus--",00:52:41.755,00:52:48.840
"and I have a multiple
of b, which is t prime,",00:52:48.840,00:52:52.140
plus u times b.,00:52:52.140,00:52:53.708
Hm.,00:52:56.636,00:52:59.072
Now this is very interesting.,00:52:59.072,00:53:00.280
"Does anybody see how
we could continue here?",00:53:00.280,00:53:02.760
"So we have r expressed as
L, minus a multiple of b.",00:53:02.760,00:53:08.260
"And I also know that
L is in this range.",00:53:08.260,00:53:10.630
"I also know that r
is in this range.",00:53:10.630,00:53:13.489
"So that's kind of
interesting, right?",00:53:13.489,00:53:15.030
So how can that be?,00:53:15.030,00:53:18.730
What should be the case here?,00:53:18.730,00:53:20.560
"Does anybody see what kind
of property t prime plus u",00:53:20.560,00:53:25.660
"must have in order
to make that happen?",00:53:25.660,00:53:30.490
So let's have a look here.,00:53:30.490,00:53:31.960
We have L. It's in this range.,00:53:31.960,00:53:35.300
So let's just draw an axis.,00:53:35.300,00:53:37.720
"So at 0, we have b.",00:53:37.720,00:53:40.340
"And somehow in this
range, we have L. Now",00:53:40.340,00:53:48.300
"if I subtract like actually
b, or something more than b,",00:53:48.300,00:53:53.590
or I add more than b.,00:53:53.590,00:53:55.470
"I will jump out of this range,
and I go somewhere over here,",00:53:55.470,00:53:59.010
or I go somewhere over there.,00:53:59.010,00:54:01.510
Right?,00:54:01.510,00:54:02.160
"So if I said suppose
L is over here,",00:54:02.160,00:54:06.050
"then L minus b would be over
here, which would be negative.",00:54:06.050,00:54:09.960
"Or if I add b, it
will be over here,",00:54:09.960,00:54:12.900
which would be more than b.,00:54:12.900,00:54:15.670
"Now we know that this is equal
to r, but r is in this range.",00:54:15.670,00:54:20.120
So that's not really possible.,00:54:20.120,00:54:21.810
So let's write it out.,00:54:21.810,00:54:23.780
"So if t prime plus
u is unequal to 0,",00:54:23.780,00:54:29.370
"so we're actually
really subtract",00:54:29.370,00:54:31.420
or add a multiple of b.,00:54:31.420,00:54:36.300
"Then I know that r is
either smaller than 0,",00:54:36.300,00:54:41.770
or r is larger than b.,00:54:41.770,00:54:45.110
"Now we know that
cannot be the case,",00:54:45.110,00:54:46.910
"so we can conclude that
t prime plus u equals 0.",00:54:46.910,00:54:51.600
"Now that implies that
t prime equals minus u,",00:54:51.600,00:54:58.520
"or maybe other way around,
because that's easier",00:54:58.520,00:55:01.040
to see what's happening.,00:55:01.040,00:55:02.200
So u equals minus t prime.,00:55:02.200,00:55:06.300
"If you plug that
in here, well, we",00:55:06.300,00:55:09.720
get exactly the same expression.,00:55:09.720,00:55:11.510
You see?,00:55:11.510,00:55:12.590
"Minus, minus t prime is
equal to plus t prime.",00:55:12.590,00:55:16.640
"And we get the exact
same linear combination.",00:55:16.640,00:55:18.560
So we conclude that r equals L.,00:55:18.560,00:55:21.910
And now we're done.,00:55:21.910,00:55:23.370
Why is that?,00:55:23.370,00:55:24.420
"Well, we have shown that the
very last number of gallons",00:55:24.420,00:55:29.034
"that is left after
this procedure,",00:55:29.034,00:55:30.450
"after this algorithm,
is actually",00:55:30.450,00:55:32.670
"exactly equal to the
linear combination",00:55:32.670,00:55:35.090
that we wanted to achieve.,00:55:35.090,00:55:36.630
"So now we got the
proof for this theorem",00:55:36.630,00:55:39.550
"that tells us that any linear
combination is actually--",00:55:39.550,00:55:49.260
"of a and b can
actually be reached",00:55:49.260,00:55:51.920
"by pouring gallons
over and back,",00:55:51.920,00:55:54.250
"and emptying and
filling those jugs.",00:55:54.250,00:55:56.980
All right let's continue.,00:55:56.980,00:55:59.170
"So there was a question over
here that I would like to--",00:55:59.170,00:56:01.707
that I would like to address.,00:56:01.707,00:56:02.915
"So maybe I did not make
so clear what the s prime,",00:56:05.990,00:56:10.600
and the t prime is over here.,00:56:10.600,00:56:12.900
"And in this proof,
we started off",00:56:12.900,00:56:16.222
with this linear combination.,00:56:16.222,00:56:17.430
"I would like to
have an algorithm",00:56:17.430,00:56:20.270
"of pouring that creates L
gallons in say the bigger jug.",00:56:20.270,00:56:25.990
"So in order to do that,
I want to find, say,",00:56:25.990,00:56:30.870
"a linear combination that
makes this L such that this",00:56:30.870,00:56:35.040
s prime is an integer--,00:56:35.040,00:56:37.110
positive integer.,00:56:37.110,00:56:38.160
"Why do I want to have
a positive integer?",00:56:38.160,00:56:40.900
"Because in this algorithm,
I'm going to repeat something",00:56:40.900,00:56:44.420
s prime times.,00:56:44.420,00:56:45.190
"If s prime is negative,
I cannot do it, right?",00:56:45.190,00:56:47.670
"So s prime has to be
a positive integer.",00:56:47.670,00:56:50.710
"In order to create such
a positive integer,",00:56:50.710,00:56:55.200
"I can just add like
1,000 times b times,",00:56:55.200,00:56:59.450
"and subtract 1,000
times a times b.",00:56:59.450,00:57:03.160
"That's OK I could
just add a lot.",00:57:03.160,00:57:06.080
"And if I add enough, I can
make s plus n times b positive.",00:57:06.080,00:57:11.220
"Even if s is, say, minus 100,
well, if I add 1,000 times 5,",00:57:11.220,00:57:17.620
I will get a positive number.,00:57:17.620,00:57:19.770
"So that's sort of
the reason this proof",00:57:19.770,00:57:22.520
"that we want to rewrite
the linear combination",00:57:22.520,00:57:25.310
"to a new one, such that
s prime is positive.",00:57:25.310,00:57:29.040
"And if we have s prime
positive, then we",00:57:29.040,00:57:31.800
"can actually talk
about this algorithm,",00:57:31.800,00:57:34.070
"because we can only repeat
something s prime times,",00:57:34.070,00:57:37.890
"if s prime is say 1, or 2,
or 3, or something positive.",00:57:37.890,00:57:41.435
All right.,00:57:44.970,00:57:46.330
"So let's-- I'll talk
about say the next part.",00:57:46.330,00:57:51.470
So we have gone--,00:57:51.470,00:57:53.560
We have proved two theorems.,00:57:53.560,00:57:56.480
"But in the end we would like
to have a characterization",00:57:56.480,00:58:01.529
of the greatest common divisor.,00:58:01.529,00:58:02.820
That's the goal of this lecture.,00:58:02.820,00:58:05.410
So let's do it.,00:58:05.410,00:58:07.250
Um.,00:58:07.250,00:58:10.000
"In order to do this,
let's first of all",00:58:10.000,00:58:14.750
"look at our five gallon,
and three gallon example.",00:58:14.750,00:58:18.290
"We know that the greatest
common divisor is equal to 1.",00:58:18.290,00:58:22.830
"We know that 1 can be rewritten
as a linear combination, as 2",00:58:22.830,00:58:30.740
"times 3, minus 1 times 5.",00:58:30.740,00:58:35.960
"So that means that according
to the theorem that we",00:58:35.960,00:58:38.530
"have up here, we can
actually make exactly 1",00:58:38.530,00:58:44.120
gallon in one of these jugs.,00:58:44.120,00:58:48.140
"So that means that we can also
have any multiple of those.",00:58:48.140,00:58:51.770
So we can reach any multiple 1.,00:58:51.770,00:58:54.970
That's very special.,00:58:54.970,00:58:56.180
"So this particular case,
we know that any multiple",00:58:56.180,00:58:59.730
"of 1, any number of
gallons can be reached.",00:58:59.730,00:59:03.100
"So can we sort of
generalize this a little bit",00:59:03.100,00:59:06.270
"by using the greatest
common divisor?",00:59:06.270,00:59:08.050
"So the greatest common
divisor 3 and 5 is equal to 1.",00:59:08.050,00:59:11.680
"And we have shown that the
greatest common divisor defies",00:59:11.680,00:59:16.700
"any result. Can we
say something more?",00:59:16.700,00:59:19.000
"Can we say that the
greatest common divisor",00:59:19.000,00:59:21.840
"can be maybe written
as a linear combination",00:59:21.840,00:59:25.040
of this type over there?,00:59:25.040,00:59:26.830
"And that's how we are
going to proceed now.",00:59:26.830,00:59:30.610
"So let's set talk about the
very special algorithm which",00:59:30.610,00:59:40.300
is called Euclid's algorithm.,00:59:40.300,00:59:43.240
"And I think in the book it's
also called The Pulverizer.",00:59:43.240,00:59:47.410
"And you will have
a problem on this",00:59:47.410,00:59:50.940
"just to see how that works,
and to really understand it.",00:59:50.940,00:59:55.660
"So let's explain
what we want here.",00:59:55.660,00:59:59.100
"So first of all, we know
that for any b and a,",00:59:59.100,01:00:05.390
"there exists a unique
quotient and remainder r.",01:00:05.390,01:00:08.580
So let's write it out.,01:00:08.580,01:00:11.740
"There exists unique q, which
we will call the quotient.",01:00:11.740,01:00:20.110
And r.,01:00:25.280,01:00:26.720
We call this the remainder.,01:00:26.720,01:00:27.845
"Such that b equals
q times a, plus r.",01:00:33.280,01:00:44.670
"With the property that 0 is
at least r, and at most a.",01:00:44.670,01:00:54.380
"So we're not going to
prove this statement.",01:00:54.380,01:00:58.630
"It's actually like
a theorem, right?",01:00:58.630,01:01:00.160
"But let's just
assume it for now.",01:01:00.160,01:01:02.387
"And in the book you
can read about it.",01:01:02.387,01:01:03.970
"We're going to use this to prove
the following lemma that we",01:01:07.805,01:01:13.110
"will need to give
a characterization",01:01:13.110,01:01:15.030
"of the greatest common divisor,
as a linear combination",01:01:15.030,01:01:18.090
of integers.,01:01:18.090,01:01:20.235
"Oh, before I forget, you
will denote this remainder",01:01:23.280,01:01:28.040
"as rem of b, a.",01:01:28.040,01:01:34.400
"And this is the notation
that we use in this lecture.",01:01:34.400,01:01:38.930
So what's the lemma?,01:01:38.930,01:01:40.090
"The lemma is that the greatest
common divisor of a and b,",01:01:40.090,01:01:46.730
"is equal to the greatest common
divisor of the remainder of b",01:01:46.730,01:01:52.790
and a.,01:01:52.790,01:01:53.441
With a.,01:01:56.090,01:01:56.590
So what did we do?,01:01:56.590,01:01:58.420
"Let's give an example
to see how this works.",01:01:58.420,01:02:02.810
"For example, let's take--",01:02:02.810,01:02:06.230
"actually let's do it
on this white board.",01:02:06.230,01:02:08.405
"So, let's see.",01:02:14.678,01:02:16.175
"For example, let's
see whether we",01:02:19.666,01:02:21.040
"can use this to calculate the
greatest common divisor 105,",01:02:21.040,01:02:27.590
and 224.,01:02:27.590,01:02:28.940
So how can we go ahead?,01:02:31.260,01:02:33.250
"Well, according
to this lemma, we",01:02:33.250,01:02:38.000
"can rewrite this as the
greatest common divisor",01:02:38.000,01:02:41.430
"of first the remainder of
224, after dividing out",01:02:41.430,01:02:49.720
"as many multiples
of 105 as possible.",01:02:49.720,01:02:54.680
And 105.,01:02:54.680,01:02:55.180
"So what are we
going to use here?",01:02:58.000,01:03:01.640
"We're going to use that 224 is
actually equal to 2 times 105,",01:03:01.640,01:03:09.370
plus 14.,01:03:09.370,01:03:10.803
So we had the GCD of 14 and 105.,01:03:14.070,01:03:18.340
Now why can I do this?,01:03:18.340,01:03:20.490
"Well, I'm essentially just
subtracting like 2 times 135",01:03:20.490,01:03:28.540
from 224.,01:03:28.540,01:03:30.850
"Well, the greatest
common divisor",01:03:30.850,01:03:32.320
"that divides 105 and
224 also divides 105,",01:03:32.320,01:03:40.050
"and a linear
combination of 105, 224.",01:03:40.050,01:03:43.700
"That's essentially
what we are using.",01:03:43.700,01:03:46.430
"And that's actually
stated in this lemma,",01:03:46.430,01:03:49.370
"and that's what we
would like to prove.",01:03:49.370,01:03:52.840
"So let's continue
with this process,",01:03:52.840,01:03:55.370
and do the same trick once more.,01:03:55.370,01:03:58.330
"So we can say that we can
rewrite this as the greatest",01:03:58.330,01:04:03.900
"common divisor of, well,
the remainder of 105",01:04:03.900,01:04:14.660
"after taking out this many
multiples of 14 as possible,",01:04:14.660,01:04:20.150
and 14.,01:04:20.150,01:04:22.580
"So what are we going
to use over here?",01:04:22.580,01:04:25.720
"We are going to use that 105
is equal to 7 times 14, plus 7.",01:04:25.720,01:04:34.200
"So this is the greatest
common divisor of 7, and 14.",01:04:34.200,01:04:40.580
"Now if you just
continue this process,",01:04:40.580,01:04:45.550
"we can see that this is equal
to the greatest common divisor,",01:04:45.550,01:04:49.230
"again, of the
remainder of now 14,",01:04:49.230,01:04:53.760
"after dividing out as many
multiples of 7 with 7.",01:04:53.760,01:05:00.090
"Now this is equal to 0, 7.",01:05:00.090,01:05:05.630
Why is that?,01:05:05.630,01:05:06.180
"Because 14 is equal
to 2 times 7, plus 0.",01:05:06.180,01:05:14.630
"So 0 is the remainder
after dividing out",01:05:14.630,01:05:18.940
"7 as many possible
times as possible.",01:05:18.940,01:05:21.510
OK.,01:05:21.510,01:05:22.010
"So we have the greatest
common divisor of 0, and 7.",01:05:22.010,01:05:25.180
"What's the largest integer
that can divide both 0 and 7?",01:05:25.180,01:05:28.950
"Well, any integer can divide 0.",01:05:28.950,01:05:32.590
"So we know that
this is equal to 7.",01:05:32.590,01:05:36.280
"So essentially, what
we have done here,",01:05:36.280,01:05:38.590
"we have repeatedly used
this particular lemma",01:05:38.590,01:05:42.600
"to compute in the end, the
greatest common divisor of 105",01:05:42.600,01:05:49.360
and 224.,01:05:49.360,01:05:51.290
And we have been very methodol--,01:05:51.290,01:05:54.690
we have used a specific method.,01:05:54.690,01:05:57.030
"We used the lemma,
and we worked it out.",01:05:57.030,01:06:01.490
"We used the lemma
again, and we just",01:06:01.490,01:06:04.120
plugged in the actual numbers.,01:06:04.120,01:06:05.880
Used to lemma again.,01:06:05.880,01:06:06.860
"Plugged in the actual
numbers, and so on.",01:06:06.860,01:06:09.860
"And this is what is
called Euclid's algorithm.",01:06:09.860,01:06:14.020
"And in the book it's also
called The Pulverizer.",01:06:14.020,01:06:16.910
"And there's, I think,
a few other names.",01:06:16.910,01:06:20.270
But I like this one.,01:06:20.270,01:06:23.190
"So this is an example
of Euclid's algorithm.",01:06:23.190,01:06:29.010
"So now let's have
to look whether we",01:06:29.010,01:06:31.370
"can have prove this particular
lemma, and actually I will--",01:06:31.370,01:06:41.910
Yep.,01:06:41.910,01:06:42.970
We're going to prove this lemma.,01:06:42.970,01:06:44.930
OK.,01:06:55.240,01:06:56.030
So how do we do the proof?,01:06:56.030,01:07:01.190
"Well, first before we
know that if- yeah.",01:07:01.190,01:07:05.640
"Well, how do we do this?",01:07:05.640,01:07:06.840
"You would like to prove that
if the great-- well, if n",01:07:06.840,01:07:10.350
"divides a and b, in
particular, the greatest",01:07:10.350,01:07:13.380
common divisor divides a and b.,01:07:13.380,01:07:17.360
"We would like to show
that it's dividing also",01:07:17.360,01:07:21.910
"the remainder of b, after
dividing out a, and a itself.",01:07:21.910,01:07:27.890
"If you can show
that, then we know",01:07:27.890,01:07:30.200
"that the greatest common
divisor of this thing",01:07:30.200,01:07:33.330
"is at least what
we have over here.",01:07:33.330,01:07:35.740
So I said a lot right now.,01:07:35.740,01:07:37.370
"So let's try to write
it out a little bit.",01:07:37.370,01:07:40.210
"So suppose that m
is any divisor of a.",01:07:40.210,01:07:44.860
"And at the same time,
m also divides b.",01:07:44.860,01:07:48.205
"Well, then I know
that m also divides",01:07:51.690,01:07:57.920
"b minus, say, the quotient, q
that we had over here, times a.",01:07:57.920,01:08:04.520
"And-- and this is actually equal
to the remainder of b and a.",01:08:04.520,01:08:11.250
"Now we also note
that m divides a.",01:08:11.250,01:08:14.950
So what did we show here?,01:08:14.950,01:08:16.210
"We showed that if m divides,
and m divides b, then m",01:08:16.210,01:08:22.439
"also divides the
remainder of b and a.",01:08:22.439,01:08:25.649
And n divides a.,01:08:25.649,01:08:27.700
So what does is prove?,01:08:27.700,01:08:29.790
"Well, it proves
that, in particular,",01:08:29.790,01:08:32.370
"the greatest common divisor
over here divides this one.",01:08:32.370,01:08:36.470
That's interesting.,01:08:36.470,01:08:37.859
"That essentially means that
we have shown this inequality.",01:08:37.859,01:08:42.930
"Because if this
one divides this,",01:08:42.930,01:08:49.180
"well, that means that
this number over here",01:08:49.180,01:08:51.970
"must be at least what
we have over here.",01:08:51.970,01:08:55.569
OK.,01:08:55.569,01:08:56.399
So let's continue.,01:08:56.399,01:08:58.400
We consider two cases.,01:09:07.620,01:09:09.080
"If the remainder of b and
a is unequal to 0, well,",01:09:09.080,01:09:14.439
what can we say now?,01:09:14.439,01:09:17.600
"We can say that if I
know that m divides",01:09:17.600,01:09:21.859
"this remainder of b and a, which
can be rewritten as b minus q,",01:09:21.859,01:09:27.569
times a.,01:09:27.569,01:09:29.819
And I also note that--,01:09:29.819,01:09:32.390
"if I also know that n
divides a, then this actually",01:09:32.390,01:09:38.520
"implies the reverse of this
statement, that n divides a,",01:09:38.520,01:09:43.120
and divides b.,01:09:43.120,01:09:45.290
Now why is that?,01:09:45.290,01:09:46.910
"Well, we're actually
using the fact",01:09:46.910,01:09:49.439
"that if n divides b, minus
q, times a, and m divides a,",01:09:49.439,01:09:53.960
"then m also defies any linear
combination of these two.",01:09:53.960,01:09:57.680
"In particular, this plus
q, times a, which is b.",01:09:57.680,01:10:04.620
m divides b.,01:10:04.620,01:10:05.710
"So maybe I'm going a little
bit fast here, I notice.",01:10:05.710,01:10:10.780
"This all also has to do with
all the lecture handouts.",01:10:10.780,01:10:15.000
"You see a few facts
on the divisibility.",01:10:15.000,01:10:17.650
"And in particular, item number
three that talks about the fact",01:10:17.650,01:10:23.380
that I'm using here.,01:10:23.380,01:10:24.380
"If a divides b on your handout,
and a divides c, then I",01:10:24.380,01:10:28.610
"know that a divides any
linear combination of b and c.",01:10:28.610,01:10:33.800
"So that's essentially what
I'm using here repeatedly.",01:10:33.800,01:10:36.255
OK,01:10:39.090,01:10:41.250
So let's look at the other case.,01:10:43.610,01:10:48.930
"If the remainder is equal
to 0, well, then I actually",01:10:48.930,01:10:54.620
"know that b minus q,
times a is equal to 0.",01:10:54.620,01:11:00.540
"Well, if I know that
m divides a, well,",01:11:00.540,01:11:07.780
"then since 0 equals b minus q,
times a, I know that b equals",01:11:07.780,01:11:16.380
"q, times a.",01:11:16.380,01:11:17.450
"So if m divides a, I also
now that m divides b.",01:11:17.450,01:11:21.260
So this is one argument.,01:11:23.920,01:11:25.570
This is another one.,01:11:25.570,01:11:27.240
And this was--,01:11:27.240,01:11:28.775
"These are the three
arguments that",01:11:28.775,01:11:30.610
"now show that anything
that divides these two also",01:11:30.610,01:11:35.970
divides a and b.,01:11:35.970,01:11:37.439
"So now we have the
reverse argument, right?",01:11:37.439,01:11:39.230
"So this greatest common
divisor divides this one here,",01:11:39.230,01:11:43.590
and this one.,01:11:43.590,01:11:45.340
"And we just proved that
it divides a and b,",01:11:45.340,01:11:49.002
"and so it must
divides the greatest",01:11:49.002,01:11:50.460
common divisor of a and b.,01:11:50.460,01:11:51.940
"So now we have shown
the other inequality,",01:11:51.940,01:11:55.030
and this proves equality.,01:11:55.030,01:11:56.190
"So you should definitely look
this up in your lecture notes.",01:11:56.190,01:11:59.160
"So now we can finally prove
this beautiful theorem",01:12:02.110,01:12:05.790
"a that will help us to
characterize the-- actually,",01:12:05.790,01:12:12.895
let me put this over here.,01:12:12.895,01:12:14.360
"So the final theorem
that we prove here",01:12:21.600,01:12:24.600
"is that the greatest
common divisor of a and b",01:12:24.600,01:12:30.630
"is actually a linear
combination of a and b.",01:12:30.630,01:12:38.280
"So we're going to use this
algorithm that you have",01:12:40.910,01:12:43.280
"over here, Euclid's algorithm.",01:12:43.280,01:12:47.460
"And we are going to do a
proof, again, by induction.",01:12:47.460,01:12:53.860
And we use an invariance.,01:12:53.860,01:12:55.470
"So we use a similar kind
of strategy, of course.",01:12:55.470,01:13:03.360
"The invariance that we
are going to use says--",01:13:03.360,01:13:09.105
"well, if Euclid's algorithm
reaches the greatest",01:13:12.230,01:13:26.050
common divisor of x and y--,01:13:26.050,01:13:29.140
"so for example, it's reach, say,
7 or 14, and 105, for example.",01:13:29.140,01:13:36.350
"Then, say, after n steps
then both x and y are",01:13:36.350,01:13:47.790
linear combinations of a and b.,01:13:47.790,01:13:51.950
"So then x and y are linear
combinations of a and b.",01:13:51.950,01:14:04.370
"And at the same
time, we also know",01:14:04.370,01:14:07.020
"that the greatest common
divisor of a and b",01:14:07.020,01:14:10.270
"is equal to the greatest
common divisor of x and y.",01:14:10.270,01:14:15.020
So this is my invariance.,01:14:15.020,01:14:17.390
"And the way I will go ahead is
to simply do what you do always",01:14:17.390,01:14:24.540
in these situations.,01:14:24.540,01:14:25.650
So we start with the base case.,01:14:25.650,01:14:28.210
"And we can immediately see that
after 0 steps in the Euclidean",01:14:28.210,01:14:33.220
"algorithm, I've done
absolutely nothing.",01:14:33.220,01:14:35.530
"So obviously after
0 steps, x equals a.",01:14:35.530,01:14:42.890
y equals b.,01:14:42.890,01:14:44.200
"So of course, they are linear
combinations of a and b.",01:14:44.200,01:14:48.060
"And this equality
holds, as well.",01:14:48.060,01:14:51.440
So for the base case--,01:14:51.440,01:14:52.680
"So after 0 steps, we immediately
know that p 0 is true.",01:14:58.130,01:15:04.790
"Now for the inductive step, we
have to do a little bit more.",01:15:04.790,01:15:08.690
"As usual, right?",01:15:17.780,01:15:19.025
We always assume p n.,01:15:19.025,01:15:24.410
"And now we would like
to prove p n plus 1.",01:15:24.410,01:15:27.320
So how do we do this?,01:15:27.320,01:15:29.572
"Well, we notice that
there exists a q such",01:15:29.572,01:15:41.510
"that the remainder of y and x
is equal to y minus q, times x.",01:15:41.510,01:15:49.730
So we assume p n.,01:15:49.730,01:15:51.270
"We have reached
some state, x, y.",01:15:51.270,01:15:54.470
"We know that the remainder
of y, x equals y minus q,",01:15:54.470,01:15:57.910
"times x, for some quotient q.",01:15:57.910,01:16:02.830
"We know that y is a linear
combination of a and b,",01:16:02.830,01:16:06.610
"and x is, as well.",01:16:06.610,01:16:08.610
"So that means that this
one is actually also",01:16:08.610,01:16:12.530
a linear combination of a and b.,01:16:12.530,01:16:18.860
"So now when we look at this
, algorithm we can see that--",01:16:18.860,01:16:25.257
"that if you look at
the remainder that",01:16:25.257,01:16:26.840
"appears in here, that's still a
linear combination of a and b.",01:16:26.840,01:16:30.850
"So after a extra step, we
notice that what we have reached",01:16:30.850,01:16:35.420
"are still in
combinations of a and b.",01:16:35.420,01:16:38.170
"And of course, the
lemme has showed--",01:16:38.170,01:16:40.890
"has shown us that what
we reach is still equal--",01:16:40.890,01:16:46.270
"the greatest common
divisor is still",01:16:46.270,01:16:47.770
"equal to what we originally
started out with.",01:16:47.770,01:16:51.320
So this proves p of n plus 1.,01:16:51.320,01:16:54.300
"So n-- let's finish
this particular proof.",01:16:58.800,01:17:03.380
"So for the very last
step, if you now",01:17:03.380,01:17:07.004
look at this particular--,01:17:07.004,01:17:08.045
"so if you look at the very end,
we notice that in every step",01:17:12.600,01:17:16.770
"the remainder is getting
smaller, and smaller,",01:17:16.770,01:17:19.750
and smaller.,01:17:19.750,01:17:20.260
Right?,01:17:20.260,01:17:22.250
"And you can use a similar
kind of proof technique",01:17:22.250,01:17:24.700
"to show that after a
finite number of steps,",01:17:24.700,01:17:28.510
"we will reach a GDP of 0, y.",01:17:28.510,01:17:33.190
Something like this.,01:17:33.190,01:17:35.200
"So in the very last step
of Euclid's algorithm",01:17:35.200,01:17:41.030
"we achieve something
off this form.",01:17:41.030,01:17:44.890
"We now use our
predicate over here,",01:17:44.890,01:17:49.220
"and say that y is a linear
combination of a and b,",01:17:49.220,01:17:53.890
"but the greatest
common divisor of 0, y",01:17:53.890,01:17:57.020
"is also equal to the original
greatest common divisor",01:17:57.020,01:17:59.900
that we want to characterize.,01:17:59.900,01:18:01.860
"So now we have
proved the theorem",01:18:01.860,01:18:05.760
"that says that the greatest
common divisor of a and b",01:18:05.760,01:18:08.110
"is actually a
linear combination.",01:18:08.110,01:18:11.830
"So now we're going to
combine all those three",01:18:11.830,01:18:13.840
theorems in one go.,01:18:13.840,01:18:16.969
"And that will show
us the final result,",01:18:16.969,01:18:25.580
"which is that the theorem that
the greatest common divisor",01:18:25.580,01:18:35.230
"of a and b is
actually the smallest",01:18:35.230,01:18:42.010
"positive linear
combination of a and b.",01:18:42.010,01:18:54.000
"So we're going to combine
all of these together.",01:18:54.000,01:18:56.840
"We know that the greatest common
divisor divides any result.",01:18:56.840,01:19:01.970
"The theorem up there says
that any linear combination",01:19:01.970,01:19:05.160
can be reached.,01:19:05.160,01:19:07.160
And also just showed--,01:19:07.160,01:19:08.949
"have shown that the
greatest common divisor",01:19:08.949,01:19:10.740
"is a linear
combination of a and b.",01:19:10.740,01:19:13.890
"So we can combine those
three to get this theorem.",01:19:13.890,01:19:17.450
So how do we do it?,01:19:17.450,01:19:19.120
"Well, let's just look
0 all the way up to b.",01:19:19.120,01:19:25.620
"Suppose these are all
the results that we",01:19:25.620,01:19:29.770
can reach in our problem.,01:19:29.770,01:19:32.530
"We know that the greatest common
divisor divides all of those.",01:19:32.530,01:19:38.160
"At the same time, it's
also linear combination",01:19:38.160,01:19:41.390
that's over here.,01:19:41.390,01:19:42.160
"Since it's a linear combination,
it can also be reached, right?",01:19:42.160,01:19:45.860
By the theorem that we have.,01:19:45.860,01:19:47.840
"So suppose that this is the
greatest common divisor.",01:19:47.840,01:19:51.099
"But we also know that the
greatest common divisor",01:19:51.099,01:19:53.140
"is dividing all of these points
here that can be reached.",01:19:53.140,01:19:57.760
"So therefore, it must
be the smallest one.",01:19:57.760,01:20:01.420
"And I will leave you
with some homework",01:20:01.420,01:20:04.050
"to think about this
very carefully.",01:20:04.050,01:20:06.210
"And you can show for
yourself that you can now",01:20:06.210,01:20:09.220
"combine those three
arguments together, and see",01:20:09.220,01:20:12.660
"that the greatest common divisor
must be the smallest positive",01:20:12.660,01:20:15.630
linear combination.,01:20:15.630,01:20:18.420
"So, I will see next Thursday.",01:20:18.420,01:20:21.770
