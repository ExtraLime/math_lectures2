ANA BELL: All right.,00:00:29.957,00:00:30.790
Let's begin.,00:00:30.790,00:00:33.100
"As I mentioned
before, this lecture",00:00:33.100,00:00:35.830
will be recorded for OCW.,00:00:35.830,00:00:37.690
"Again, in future
lectures, if you",00:00:37.690,00:00:39.309
"don't want to have the
back of your head show up,",00:00:39.309,00:00:41.350
"just don't sit in
this front area here.",00:00:41.350,00:00:44.880
"First of all, wow,
what a crowd, you guys.",00:00:44.880,00:00:46.630
We're finally in 26-100.,00:00:46.630,00:00:48.490
"6.0001 made it big, huh?",00:00:48.490,00:00:52.240
"Good afternoon and welcome to
the very first class of 6.0001,",00:00:52.240,00:00:55.960
"and also 600, this semester.",00:00:55.960,00:00:58.960
My name is Ana Bell.,00:00:58.960,00:01:00.610
"First name, Ana.",00:01:00.610,00:01:01.840
"Last name, Bell.",00:01:01.840,00:01:03.250
"I'm a lecturer in
the EECS Department.",00:01:03.250,00:01:06.460
"And I'll be giving some
of the lectures for today,",00:01:06.460,00:01:08.680
"along with later on in the term,
Professor Eric Grimson, who's",00:01:08.680,00:01:13.030
"sitting right down there, will
be giving some of the lectures,",00:01:13.030,00:01:15.820
as well.,00:01:15.820,00:01:17.620
"Today we're going to go over
some basic administrivia,",00:01:17.620,00:01:21.550
"a little bit of
course information.",00:01:21.550,00:01:23.101
"And then, we're going
to talk a little bit",00:01:23.101,00:01:24.850
about what is computation?,00:01:24.850,00:01:26.164
"We'll discuss at
a very high level",00:01:26.164,00:01:27.580
"what computers do just
to make sure we're all",00:01:27.580,00:01:29.860
on the same page.,00:01:29.860,00:01:31.610
"And then, we're going to dive
right into Python basics.",00:01:31.610,00:01:34.180
"We're going to talk a little bit
about mathematical operations",00:01:34.180,00:01:36.763
you can do with Python.,00:01:36.763,00:01:38.134
"And then, we're going to
talk about Python variables",00:01:38.134,00:01:40.300
and types.,00:01:40.300,00:01:42.010
"As I mentioned in my
introductory email, all",00:01:42.010,00:01:43.907
"the slides and code that I'll
talk about during lectures",00:01:43.907,00:01:46.240
"will be up before
lecture, so I highly",00:01:46.240,00:01:48.250
"encourage you to download
them and to have them open.",00:01:48.250,00:01:52.540
"We're going to go through some
in-class exercises which will",00:01:52.540,00:01:56.020
be available on those slides.,00:01:56.020,00:01:57.820
And it's fun to do.,00:01:57.820,00:01:59.830
"And it's also great if could
take notes about the code just",00:01:59.830,00:02:07.420
for future reference.,00:02:07.420,00:02:09.210
It's true.,00:02:09.210,00:02:10.210
"This is a really
fast-paced course,",00:02:10.210,00:02:12.220
and we ramp up really quickly.,00:02:12.220,00:02:14.110
"We do want to position you
to succeed in this course.",00:02:14.110,00:02:17.842
"As I was writing
this, I was trying",00:02:17.842,00:02:19.300
"to think about when
I was first starting",00:02:19.300,00:02:21.160
"to program what helped
me get through my very",00:02:21.160,00:02:24.580
first programming course.,00:02:24.580,00:02:26.110
And this is really a good list.,00:02:26.110,00:02:29.470
"The first thing was I just
read the psets as soon",00:02:29.470,00:02:31.840
"as they came out, made sure that
the terminology just sunk in.",00:02:31.840,00:02:37.600
"And then, during
lectures, if the lecturer",00:02:37.600,00:02:39.760
"was talking about something
that suddenly I remembered,",00:02:39.760,00:02:42.967
"oh, I saw that word in the pset
and I didn't know what it was.",00:02:42.967,00:02:45.550
"Well, hey, now I
know what it is.",00:02:45.550,00:02:46.720
Right?,00:02:46.720,00:02:47.200
So just give it a read.,00:02:47.200,00:02:48.158
You don't need to start it.,00:02:48.158,00:02:51.520
"If you're new to programming, I
think the key word is practice.",00:02:51.520,00:02:55.390
It's like math or reading.,00:02:55.390,00:02:57.880
"The more you practice,
the better you get at it.",00:02:57.880,00:03:00.260
"You're not going to
absorb programming",00:03:00.260,00:03:01.877
"by watching me write programs
because I already know how",00:03:01.877,00:03:04.210
to program.,00:03:04.210,00:03:05.170
You guys need to practice.,00:03:05.170,00:03:07.966
"Download the code
before lecture.",00:03:07.966,00:03:09.340
Follow along.,00:03:09.340,00:03:10.090
"Whatever I type,
you guys can type.",00:03:10.090,00:03:12.430
"And I think, also,
one of the big things",00:03:12.430,00:03:14.436
"is if you're new to
programming, you're",00:03:14.436,00:03:16.060
"kind of afraid that you're
going to break your computer.",00:03:16.060,00:03:19.360
"And you can't really do that
just by running Anaconda",00:03:19.360,00:03:24.400
and typing in some commands.,00:03:24.400,00:03:26.485
"So don't be afraid to
just type some stuff in",00:03:26.485,00:03:28.360
and see what it does.,00:03:28.360,00:03:29.480
"Worst case, you just
restart the computer.",00:03:29.480,00:03:31.230
Yeah.,00:03:35.390,00:03:36.411
"That's probably the
big thing right there.",00:03:36.411,00:03:38.160
"I should have probably
highlighted it,",00:03:38.160,00:03:39.743
but don't be afraid.,00:03:39.743,00:03:40.881
Great.,00:03:40.881,00:03:41.380
"So this is pretty much a
roadmap of all of 6.0001 or 600",00:03:41.380,00:03:46.780
as I've just explained it.,00:03:46.780,00:03:47.890
"There's three big things we
want to get out of this course.",00:03:47.890,00:03:51.880
"The first thing is the
knowledge of concepts,",00:03:51.880,00:03:54.130
"which is pretty much true of
any class that you'll take.",00:03:54.130,00:03:56.650
"The class will teach you
something through lectures.",00:03:56.650,00:03:59.740
"Exams will test
how much you know.",00:03:59.740,00:04:02.500
This is a class in programming.,00:04:02.500,00:04:05.830
"The other thing we want
you to get out of it",00:04:05.830,00:04:08.950
is programming skills.,00:04:08.950,00:04:10.841
"And the last thing,
and I think this",00:04:10.841,00:04:12.340
"is what makes this
class really great,",00:04:12.340,00:04:13.923
"is we teach you how
to solve problems.",00:04:13.923,00:04:16.240
"And we do that
through the psets.",00:04:16.240,00:04:18.730
"That's really how I feel
the roadmap of this course",00:04:18.730,00:04:21.010
looks like.,00:04:21.010,00:04:22.600
"And underlying all of
these is just practice.",00:04:22.600,00:04:25.300
"You have to just type some
stuff away and code a lot.",00:04:25.300,00:04:29.800
"And you'll succeed in
this course, I think.",00:04:29.800,00:04:33.490
OK.,00:04:33.490,00:04:35.590
"So what are the things we're
going to learn in this class?",00:04:35.590,00:04:38.800
"I feel like the things we're
going learn in this class",00:04:38.800,00:04:41.650
"can be divided into basically
three different sections.",00:04:41.650,00:04:44.470
"The first one is related to
these first two items here.",00:04:44.470,00:04:50.290
"It's really about
learning how to program.",00:04:50.290,00:04:53.380
"Learning how to
program, part of it",00:04:53.380,00:04:55.330
"is figuring out what
objects to create.",00:04:55.330,00:04:58.990
You'll learn about these later.,00:04:58.990,00:05:00.394
"How do you represent knowledge
with data structures?",00:05:00.394,00:05:02.560
"That's sort of the
broad term for that.",00:05:02.560,00:05:04.529
"And then, as you're
writing programs,",00:05:04.529,00:05:06.070
"you need to-- programs
aren't just linear.",00:05:06.070,00:05:08.830
Sometimes programs jump around.,00:05:08.830,00:05:10.300
They make decisions.,00:05:10.300,00:05:11.260
"There's some control
flow to programs.",00:05:11.260,00:05:13.690
"That's what the second
line is going to be about.",00:05:13.690,00:05:18.620
"The second big
part of this course",00:05:18.620,00:05:20.900
"is a little bit more
abstract, and it",00:05:20.900,00:05:24.590
"deals with how do you write
good code, good style,",00:05:24.590,00:05:29.000
code that's readable.,00:05:29.000,00:05:30.530
"When you write code, you
want to write it such",00:05:30.530,00:05:33.020
"that-- you're in big company,
other people will read it,",00:05:33.020,00:05:35.480
"other people will
use it, so it has",00:05:35.480,00:05:37.970
"to be readable and
understandable by others.",00:05:37.970,00:05:40.220
"To that end, you
need to write code",00:05:40.220,00:05:41.900
"that's well organized,
modular, easy to understand.",00:05:41.900,00:05:48.820
"And not only that, not
only will your code",00:05:48.820,00:05:50.570
"be read by other people,
but next year, maybe,",00:05:50.570,00:05:53.577
"you'll take another
course, and you'll",00:05:53.577,00:05:55.160
"want to look back at
some of the problems",00:05:55.160,00:05:56.868
that you wrote in this class.,00:05:56.868,00:05:58.320
"You want to be able
to reread your code.",00:05:58.320,00:06:00.740
"If it's a big mess, you might
not be able to understand--",00:06:00.740,00:06:03.950
"or reunderstand--
what you were doing.",00:06:03.950,00:06:06.530
"So writing readable
code and organizing code",00:06:06.530,00:06:08.630
is also a big part.,00:06:08.630,00:06:10.360
"And the last section is going
to deal with-- the first two",00:06:10.360,00:06:15.680
"are actually part of the
programming in Introduction",00:06:15.680,00:06:19.100
"to Programming and
Computer Science in Python.",00:06:19.100,00:06:21.440
"And the last one deals mostly
with the computer science part",00:06:21.440,00:06:26.000
"in Introduction to Programming
and Computer Science in Python.",00:06:26.000,00:06:29.540
"We're going to talk about,
once you have learned",00:06:29.540,00:06:31.970
"how to write programs
in Python, how do",00:06:31.970,00:06:33.650
you compare programs in Python?,00:06:33.650,00:06:35.540
"How do you know that one program
is better than the other?",00:06:35.540,00:06:38.162
"How do you know
that one program is",00:06:38.162,00:06:39.620
more efficient than the other?,00:06:39.620,00:06:41.084
"How do you know
that one algorithm",00:06:41.084,00:06:42.500
is better than the other?,00:06:42.500,00:06:45.230
"That's what we're going to
talk about in the last part",00:06:45.230,00:06:47.480
of the course.,00:06:47.480,00:06:48.850
OK.,00:06:48.850,00:06:50.250
"That's all for the
administrative part",00:06:50.250,00:06:52.920
of the course.,00:06:52.920,00:06:54.230
"Let's start by talking at a high
level what does a computer do.",00:06:54.230,00:06:59.640
"Fundamentally, it
does two things.",00:06:59.640,00:07:03.130
"One, performs calculations.",00:07:03.130,00:07:05.960
"It performs a lot
of calculations.",00:07:05.960,00:07:07.770
"Computers these days
are really, really fast,",00:07:07.770,00:07:09.680
"a billion calculations per
second is probably not far off.",00:07:09.680,00:07:15.240
"It performs these
calculations and it",00:07:15.240,00:07:16.920
has to store them somewhere.,00:07:16.920,00:07:18.550
Right?,00:07:18.550,00:07:19.050
Stores them in computer memory.,00:07:19.050,00:07:21.030
"So a computer also has
to remember results.",00:07:21.030,00:07:24.070
"And these days, it's not
uncommon to find computers",00:07:24.070,00:07:26.280
"with hundreds of
gigabytes of storage.",00:07:26.280,00:07:30.390
"The kinds of calculations
that computers do,",00:07:30.390,00:07:34.457
there are two kinds.,00:07:34.457,00:07:35.290
"One are calculations that
are built into the language.",00:07:35.290,00:07:37.590
"These are the very
low level types",00:07:37.590,00:07:39.450
"of calculations,
things like addition,",00:07:39.450,00:07:41.890
"subtraction,
multiplication, and so on.",00:07:41.890,00:07:45.610
"And once you have
a language that",00:07:45.610,00:07:47.790
"has these primitive calculation
types, you, as a programmer,",00:07:47.790,00:07:53.070
"can put these types
together and then define",00:07:53.070,00:07:55.890
your own calculations.,00:07:55.890,00:07:57.680
"You can create new
types of calculations.",00:07:57.680,00:08:00.210
"And the computer will be able
to perform those, as well.",00:08:00.210,00:08:04.570
"I think, one thing
I want to stress--",00:08:04.570,00:08:07.810
"and we're going to
come back to this",00:08:07.810,00:08:09.930
"again during this entire
lecture, actually--",00:08:09.930,00:08:12.300
"is computers only know
what you tell them.",00:08:12.300,00:08:15.690
"Computers only do what
you tell them to do.",00:08:15.690,00:08:18.220
They're not magical.,00:08:18.220,00:08:19.860
They don't have a mind.,00:08:19.860,00:08:22.667
"They just know how to
perform calculations really,",00:08:22.667,00:08:24.750
really quickly.,00:08:24.750,00:08:26.340
"But you have to tell them
what calculations to do.",00:08:26.340,00:08:29.936
Computers don't know anything.,00:08:32.940,00:08:34.500
All right.,00:08:34.500,00:08:35.220
We've come to that.,00:08:35.220,00:08:36.050
"Let's go into the
types of knowledge.",00:08:40.059,00:08:44.320
"The first type of knowledge
is declarative knowledge.",00:08:44.320,00:08:48.220
"And those are things
like statements of fact.",00:08:48.220,00:08:50.730
"And this is where my
email came into play.",00:08:50.730,00:08:53.080
"If you read it all
the way to the bottom,",00:08:53.080,00:08:55.500
you would have entered a raffle.,00:08:55.500,00:08:57.960
"So a statement of fact
for today's lecture",00:08:57.960,00:08:59.890
"is, someone will win a
prize before class ends.",00:08:59.890,00:09:03.280
"And the prize was
a Google Cardboard.",00:09:03.280,00:09:06.820
"Google state-of-the-art
virtual reality glasses.",00:09:06.820,00:09:09.890

We're MIT students.,00:12:37.190,00:12:39.110
And we love numbers here at MIT.,00:12:39.110,00:12:41.900

declarative knowledge",00:12:50.000,00:12:51.470

the square root of 16.",00:13:28.620,00:13:30.940
"We're going to calculate
g times g is 9.",00:13:30.940,00:13:34.320

ask is if g times g",00:13:34.320,00:13:36.120
"is close enough to x, then
stop and say, g is the answer.",00:13:36.120,00:13:39.670
"I'm not really happy with
9 being really close to 16.",00:13:39.670,00:13:42.699

I'm not stopping here.",00:13:42.699,00:13:44.490
I'm going to keep going.,00:13:44.490,00:13:47.130
"If it's not close
enough, then I'm",00:13:47.130,00:13:48.690
"going to make a new guess
by averaging g and x over g.",00:13:48.690,00:13:52.920

"And that's the
average over there.",00:13:54.480,00:13:57.150

going to be my new guess.",00:13:57.150,00:14:00.120

is using the new guess,",00:14:05.430,00:14:07.680
repeat the process.,00:14:07.680,00:14:08.790

parts of the recipe?",00:14:31.604,00:14:33.270

sequence of steps.",00:14:33.270,00:14:36.090

control, so there were",00:14:39.270,00:14:42.660
parts where we made decisions.,00:14:42.660,00:14:45.360
Are we close enough?,00:14:45.360,00:14:46.980
"There were parts where
we repeated some steps.",00:14:46.980,00:14:49.320

repeat steps 1, 2, 3.",00:14:49.320,00:14:52.890
That's the flow of control.,00:14:52.890,00:14:55.320

recipe was a way to stop.",00:14:55.320,00:14:58.340
"You don't want a program
that keeps going and going.",00:14:58.340,00:15:00.660
"Or for a recipe, you don't want
to keep baking bread forever.",00:15:00.660,00:15:03.869

"Like 10 breads is enough, right?",00:15:05.160,00:15:07.800
"So you have to have
a way of stopping.",00:15:07.800,00:15:10.230
"In the previous example,
the way of stopping",00:15:10.230,00:15:12.780
"was that we decided
we were close enough.",00:15:12.780,00:15:15.240

"And the test is going to
either return true or false.",00:19:13.200,00:19:17.630
"And depending on the
result of that test,",00:19:17.630,00:19:20.810
"you might either go to
the next instruction,",00:19:20.810,00:19:24.530

way that a computer works.",00:19:47.180,00:19:53.420

the stored program computer",00:19:53.420,00:19:55.790
"that contains these
sequences of instructions.",00:19:55.790,00:19:59.140
"The primitive operations
that it can do",00:19:59.140,00:20:00.950
"are addition, subtraction,
logic operations, tests--",00:20:00.950,00:20:06.050

to something else, something",00:20:06.050,00:20:08.840

on-- and moving data,",00:20:08.840,00:20:10.790
"so storing data, moving data
around, and things like that.",00:20:10.790,00:20:14.390

through every instruction",00:20:14.390,00:20:19.836

to go to the next instruction,",00:20:19.836,00:20:22.460
"skip instructions, or repeat
instructions, and so on.",00:20:22.460,00:20:28.830
"So we've talked
about primitives.",00:20:28.830,00:20:30.570
"And in fact, Alan Turing, who
was a really great computer",00:20:30.570,00:20:35.267
"scientist, he showed that
you can compute anything",00:20:35.267,00:20:37.350

these six primitives",00:21:16.080,00:21:19.230
"is that if you can compute
something in Python,",00:21:19.230,00:21:22.290

program that computes something",00:21:22.290,00:21:25.770

Think about that again.,00:21:39.660,00:21:40.860
That's really powerful.,00:21:40.860,00:21:41.910
"Once you have your
set of primitives",00:21:45.240,00:21:49.980
"for a particular language, you
can start creating expressions.",00:21:49.980,00:21:53.839

primitive constructs",00:22:14.020,00:22:15.520

this, ""3.2 times 5, is OK.",00:24:11.440,00:24:15.950

English, et cetera.",00:29:52.930,00:29:55.700

Python objects,",00:30:09.640,00:30:11.200

object in Python.",00:30:11.200,00:30:14.934
"There are actually
two types of objects.",00:30:14.934,00:30:16.600
One are scalar objects.,00:30:16.600,00:30:18.100
"That means these are very basic
objects in Python from which",00:30:18.100,00:30:21.370
everything can be made.,00:30:21.370,00:30:24.760
These are scalar objects.,00:30:24.760,00:30:26.050
That can't be subdivided.,00:30:26.050,00:30:28.480
"The other type of object
is a non-scalar object.",00:30:28.480,00:30:31.210
"And these are objects that
have some internal structure.",00:30:31.210,00:30:33.700
"For example, the
number five is a scalar",00:30:33.700,00:30:36.730
"object because it
can't be subdivided.",00:30:36.730,00:30:39.070
"But a list of numbers,
for example, 5, 6,",00:30:39.070,00:30:41.710
"7,8, is going to be
a non-scalar object",00:30:41.710,00:30:45.370
because you can subdivide it.,00:30:45.370,00:30:46.600
"You can subdivide it into--
you can find parts to it.",00:30:46.600,00:30:53.120
"It's made up of a
sequence of numbers.",00:30:53.120,00:30:55.130
"Here's the list of all of
the scalar objects in Python.",00:30:58.700,00:31:01.220
"We have integers, for example,
all of the whole numbers.",00:31:01.220,00:31:05.870
"Floats, which are all of
the real numbers, anything",00:31:05.870,00:31:10.130
with a decimal.,00:31:10.130,00:31:11.510
Bools are Booleans.,00:31:11.510,00:31:13.760
"There's only two
values to Booleans.",00:31:13.760,00:31:16.100
That's True and False.,00:31:16.100,00:31:18.500
"Note the capitalization,
capital T and capital F.",00:31:18.500,00:31:23.060
"And this other thing
called NoneType.",00:31:23.060,00:31:24.805
It's special.,00:31:24.805,00:31:26.510
"It has only one
value called None.",00:31:26.510,00:31:28.590
"And it represents the
absence of a type.",00:31:28.590,00:31:30.500
"And it sometimes comes in
handy for some programs.",00:31:30.500,00:31:34.640
"If you want to find
the type of an object,",00:31:34.640,00:31:36.390
"you can use this special
command called type.",00:31:36.390,00:31:39.532
"And then in the
parentheses, you put down",00:31:39.532,00:31:41.240
"what you want to
find the type of.",00:31:41.240,00:31:44.840
"You can write into
the shell ""type of 5,""",00:31:44.840,00:31:47.480
"and the shell will tell
you, that's an integer.",00:31:47.480,00:31:49.566
"If you happen to want to convert
between two different types,",00:31:52.990,00:31:56.290
Python allows you to do that.,00:31:56.290,00:31:58.180
"And to do that, you
put the type that you",00:31:58.180,00:32:01.450
"want to convert to
right before the object",00:32:01.450,00:32:03.820
that you want to convert to.,00:32:03.820,00:32:05.270
"So float(3) will convert the
integer 3 to the float 3.0.",00:32:05.270,00:32:12.700
"And similarly, you can convert
any float into an integer.",00:32:12.700,00:32:16.870
"And converting to an
integer just truncates.",00:32:16.870,00:32:20.170
"It just takes away the
decimal and whatever's",00:32:20.170,00:32:22.180
"after it-- it does not round--
and keeps just the integer",00:32:22.180,00:32:26.150
part.,00:32:26.150,00:32:26.650
"For this slide, I'm
going to talk about it.",00:32:30.119,00:32:31.910
"But if you'd like if
you have the slides up,",00:32:31.910,00:32:35.060
go to go to this exercise.,00:32:35.060,00:32:37.200
"And after I'm done
talking about the slide,",00:32:37.200,00:32:41.000
"we'll see what people
think for that exercise.",00:32:41.000,00:32:45.532
"One of the most
important things that you",00:32:45.532,00:32:47.240
"can do in basically
any programming,",00:32:47.240,00:32:51.280
"in Python also, is
to print things out.",00:32:51.280,00:32:55.520
"Printing out is how you
interact with the user.",00:32:55.520,00:33:00.292
"To print things out, you
use the print command.",00:33:00.292,00:33:02.250
"If you're in the shell, if
you simply type ""3 plus 2,""",00:33:04.850,00:33:07.560
you do see a value here.,00:33:07.560,00:33:09.700
"Five, right?",00:33:09.700,00:33:11.720
"But that's not actually
printing something out.",00:33:11.720,00:33:13.850
"And that becomes apparent
when you actually",00:33:13.850,00:33:18.380
type things into the editor.,00:33:18.380,00:33:19.640
"If you just do ""3 plus 2,"" and
you run the program-- that's",00:33:19.640,00:33:23.160
"the green button here-- you see
on the right-hand side here,",00:33:23.160,00:33:26.270
it ran my program.,00:33:26.270,00:33:27.080
"But it didn't actually
print anything.",00:33:27.080,00:33:30.200
"If you type this
into the console,",00:33:30.200,00:33:32.150
"it does show you this
value, but that's",00:33:32.150,00:33:33.920
"just like peeking into the
value for you as a programmer.",00:33:33.920,00:33:39.470
"It's not actually
printing it out to anyone.",00:33:39.470,00:33:41.412
"If you want to
print something out,",00:33:41.412,00:33:42.870
"you have to use the print
statement like that.",00:33:42.870,00:33:47.990
"In this case, this is actually
going to print this number",00:33:47.990,00:33:50.630
five to the console.,00:33:50.630,00:33:52.290
That's basically what it says.,00:33:58.296,00:33:59.545
"It just tells you it's an
interaction within the shell",00:33:59.545,00:34:01.794
only.,00:34:01.794,00:34:02.410
"It's not interacting
with anyone else.",00:34:02.410,00:34:04.529
"And if you don't
have any ""Out,"" that",00:34:04.529,00:34:06.070
"means it got printed
out to the console.",00:34:06.070,00:34:09.489
All right.,00:34:09.489,00:34:09.989
"We talked a little
bit about objects.",00:34:09.989,00:34:13.320
"Once you have objects, you can
combine objects and operators",00:34:13.320,00:34:16.050
to form these expressions.,00:34:16.050,00:34:17.170
"And each expression is
going to have a value.",00:34:17.170,00:34:19.440
"So an expression
evaluates to a value.",00:34:19.440,00:34:22.949
"The syntax for an
expression is going",00:34:22.949,00:34:24.600
"to be object, operator,
object, like that.",00:34:24.600,00:34:30.449
"And these are some operators
you can do on ints and floats.",00:34:30.449,00:34:34.409
"There's the typical ones,
addition, subtraction,",00:34:34.409,00:34:36.580
"multiplication, and division.",00:34:36.580,00:34:38.710
"If, for the first
three, the answer",00:34:38.710,00:34:43.104
"that you get-- the type of
the answer that you get--",00:34:43.104,00:34:45.270
"is going to depend on the
type of your variables.",00:34:45.270,00:34:48.480
"If both of the variables of
the operands are integers,",00:34:48.480,00:34:52.769
"then the result you're going
to get is of type integer.",00:34:52.769,00:34:55.060
"But if at least one of
them is a float, then",00:34:55.060,00:34:56.893
"the result you're going
to get is a float.",00:34:56.893,00:34:58.940
"Division is a little
bit special in that",00:34:58.940,00:35:02.340
"no matter what the
operands are, the result",00:35:02.340,00:35:04.690
is always going to be a float.,00:35:04.690,00:35:05.940
"The other operations you can
do, and these are also useful,",00:35:09.760,00:35:14.480
"are the remainder,
so the percent sign.",00:35:14.480,00:35:19.140
"If you use the percent
sign between two operands,",00:35:19.140,00:35:22.960
"that's going to give you the
remainder when you divide i",00:35:22.960,00:35:25.540
by j.,00:35:25.540,00:35:28.024
"And raising something to
the power of something else",00:35:28.024,00:35:30.190
is using the star star operator.,00:35:30.190,00:35:32.770
"And i star stars j is going
to take i to the power of j.",00:35:32.770,00:35:36.050
"These operations have
the typical precedence",00:35:41.390,00:35:43.940
"that you might expect
in math, for example.",00:35:43.940,00:35:47.060
"And if you'd like
to put precedence",00:35:47.060,00:35:49.075
"toward some other
operations, you",00:35:49.075,00:35:50.450
can use parentheses to do that.,00:35:50.450,00:35:52.270
All right.,00:36:01.490,00:36:03.990
"So we have ways of
creating expressions.",00:36:03.990,00:36:07.050
"And we have operations
we can do on objects.",00:36:07.050,00:36:13.500
"But what's going to be useful
is to be able to save values",00:36:13.500,00:36:19.140
to some name.,00:36:19.140,00:36:21.390
"And the name is going to
be something that you pick.",00:36:21.390,00:36:24.780
"And it should be a
descriptive name.",00:36:24.780,00:36:27.840

the value to a name,",00:36:27.840,00:36:32.310
"you're going to be able
to access that value later",00:36:32.310,00:36:36.030
on in your program.,00:36:36.030,00:36:37.950
And that's very useful.,00:36:37.950,00:36:40.440
"To save a value to a variable
name, you use the equal sign.",00:36:40.440,00:36:45.270
"And the equal sign
is an assignment.",00:36:49.180,00:36:51.520
"It assigns the
right-hand side, which",00:36:51.520,00:36:53.080
"is a value, to the
left-hand side, which",00:36:53.080,00:36:55.540
is going to be a variable name.,00:36:55.540,00:36:56.898
"In this case, I assigned
the float 3.14159",00:36:59.500,00:37:03.000
to the variable pi.,00:37:03.000,00:37:05.590
"And in the second
line, I'm going",00:37:05.590,00:37:08.200
"to take this expression,
22 divided by 7,",00:37:08.200,00:37:10.750

with some decimal number.",00:37:13.090,00:37:16.060

in Python, we",00:37:21.520,00:37:22.960

the name to the value.",00:37:22.960,00:37:26.950
"When you use that name
later on in your program,",00:37:26.950,00:37:30.850
"you're going to be referring
to the value in memory.",00:37:30.850,00:37:35.650
"And if you ever want
to refer to the value",00:37:35.650,00:37:37.879

you just simply type",00:37:37.879,00:37:39.670
"the name of the variable
that you've assigned it to.",00:37:39.670,00:37:44.470

names to expressions?",00:37:44.470,00:37:48.250
"Well, you want to reuse the
names instead of the values.",00:37:48.250,00:37:51.670

the calculation for me.",00:38:30.100,00:38:32.850

expression here.",00:40:40.630,00:40:44.590

the values for pi",00:40:44.590,00:40:46.630

value that this expression",00:40:49.950,00:40:54.730
evaluates to.,00:40:54.730,00:40:56.310

that into the memory.",00:40:56.310,00:40:57.940

radius to be something else.",00:41:08.310,00:41:14.940
"Radius i is bound
to the value 2.2.",00:41:14.940,00:41:21.540

is equal to radius plus 1,",00:41:21.540,00:41:24.540

away the binding to 2.2.",00:41:24.540,00:41:27.600
"We're going to do
this calculation.",00:41:27.600,00:41:29.970

did not change.",00:42:18.980,00:42:20.450
"And it did not change because
these are all the instructions",00:42:23.150,00:42:26.000
we told the computer to do.,00:42:26.000,00:42:28.460

what we tell it to do.",00:42:44.430,00:42:46.954

how do you tell the computer",00:42:51.150,00:42:53.570
