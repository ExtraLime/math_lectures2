is the start of week one.",00:00:11.375,00:00:14.430
"And what we thought we'd do is pull back
the curtain of a device that many",00:00:14.430,00:00:17.930
"of you have probably walked past now
for years, but perhaps never quite",00:00:17.930,00:00:20.970
known what it is.,00:00:20.970,00:00:22.280
"So this device will probably look
familiar to most of you by now.",00:00:22.280,00:00:26.000

"&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: So that's what you see in
the Science Center, which is where",00:01:18.600,00:01:21.980
that machine is now housed.,00:01:21.980,00:01:23.540
You actually only see part of it.,00:01:23.540,00:01:25.910
"Only a portion is currently on display,
and that's a device called",00:01:25.910,00:01:28.800
"the Mark I, and it was essentially
a really huge calculator.",00:01:28.800,00:01:31.970
"It was succeeded by the Mark II, and
it's from the Mark II that we actually",00:01:31.970,00:01:36.250
get a bit of lexicon.,00:01:36.250,00:01:39.210
"&gt;&gt; This is the first recorded instance of
something you're about to become all",00:01:39.210,00:01:43.780
"too familiar with over the
course of the semester--",00:01:43.780,00:01:45.860
"namely, a bug.",00:01:45.860,00:01:48.460
"So it turned out at one point the Mark
II device was not functioning",00:01:48.460,00:01:52.030
"properly, and upon closer inspection,
there was indeed a bug-- a moth--",00:01:52.030,00:01:55.930
that moth--,00:01:55.930,00:01:56.910
inside.,00:01:56.910,00:01:57.610
"And ever since, we have referred to
mistakes in programs as bugs.",00:01:57.610,00:02:03.130
So more on that to come.,00:02:03.130,00:02:05.330
"&gt;&gt; Speaking of video as well, if you
haven't already, know that CS50 is",00:02:05.330,00:02:08.919
obviously filmed.,00:02:08.919,00:02:09.669
"The lectures typically go up right after
class in sort of a pre-release",00:02:09.669,00:02:13.330
"unedited format, and then a day or two
later, we put up a higher resolution",00:02:13.330,00:02:17.240
and higher quality version.,00:02:17.240,00:02:18.490
"You may recall Vanessa, who had the
fortune of playing with Google Glass,",00:02:18.490,00:02:21.800
"which I remembered to
charge this time.",00:02:21.800,00:02:23.540
"So if you want to come up after class
and play, they should work today.",00:02:23.540,00:02:26.450
"And if you'd like to see what Vanessa
saw the other day, what you'll see",00:02:26.450,00:02:30.816
"here-- let me raise the volume
here on my laptop.",00:02:30.816,00:02:35.260

&gt;&gt; -So let me queue this is up.,00:02:35.690,00:02:37.620
All right.,00:02:37.620,00:02:38.070
So touch this.,00:02:38.070,00:02:40.930
All right.,00:02:40.930,00:02:41.720
"OK, Glass.",00:02:41.720,00:02:43.470
Record a video.,00:02:43.470,00:02:44.720
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:02:47.240,00:02:48.640
Vanessa?,00:02:48.640,00:02:50.446
&gt;&gt; [END VIDEO PLAYBACK],00:02:50.446,00:02:50.870
"&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: All right, so the reason
that it didn't work for most of you at",00:02:50.870,00:02:53.485
"the end of class was because I proceeded
to record an hour of that",00:02:53.485,00:02:56.540
"footage pointing at myself after
I put the glasses down.",00:02:56.540,00:02:59.505
"So today, I'll leave them off, but thank
you to Vanessa for being such a",00:02:59.505,00:03:04.010
good sport.,00:03:04.010,00:03:05.420
"&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, a couple of announcements
before we forge ahead today.",00:03:05.420,00:03:08.330
"So one, CS50 has a tradition of doing
what we can to try to make a very",00:03:08.330,00:03:11.120
large class feel smaller.,00:03:11.120,00:03:12.630
"And toward that end, most every Friday,
we gather at a restaurant in",00:03:12.630,00:03:16.640
"the square, Fire and Ice, with 30 or 40
of your classmates, myself, some of",00:03:16.640,00:03:20.160
"the teaching staff, and we just
have a very casual lunch.",00:03:20.160,00:03:22.520
"We often invite friends from industry,
alumni of the class, alumni of the",00:03:22.520,00:03:26.280
"college, really just to chat each
other up, talk about life after",00:03:26.280,00:03:30.340
"college, life in college,
and the like.",00:03:30.340,00:03:32.260
"So if you would like to partake in this
first such lunch this Friday at",00:03:32.260,00:03:35.570
"1:15 PM, head to that
URL at some point.",00:03:35.570,00:03:38.640
"&gt;&gt; Space is limited, so we'll do
first come first serve.",00:03:38.640,00:03:40.830
"But we'll do this again on a recurring
basis, so not to worry if you don't",00:03:40.830,00:03:43.880
make it into this first batch.,00:03:43.880,00:03:45.800
"&gt;&gt; Now, in terms of the resources provided
curricularly by the course,",00:03:45.800,00:03:48.960
"there's a whole slew, and if you haven't
pulled up the course's website",00:03:48.960,00:03:51.500
"already, in particular, under lectures,
you'll find that everything",00:03:51.500,00:03:54.310
"we did last week is there, both
in video and some sort",00:03:54.310,00:03:57.070
of electronic form.,00:03:57.070,00:03:58.435
"But beyond the videos, you'll find
that there are now full text",00:03:58.435,00:04:01.210
"transcripts, for instance,
of every lecture.",00:04:01.210,00:04:03.290
"&gt;&gt; So if we actually go back to this screen
here with Vanessa, and navigate",00:04:03.290,00:04:08.260
"to the bottom corner of the screen,
you'll find that actually, not for",00:04:08.260,00:04:12.010
"Friday's lecture, but if we go back to
Wednesday, since this feature takes a",00:04:12.010,00:04:15.060
"few days, you'll find that you can
actually pull up, for better or for",00:04:15.060,00:04:17.870
"worse, every word that I or
a volunteer on stage said.",00:04:17.870,00:04:22.260
And more than just that.,00:04:22.260,00:04:23.270
"You can actually search it, you can
click on any of those sentences, jump",00:04:23.270,00:04:25.700
"to that point in the video, all toward
and end of making the material all the",00:04:25.700,00:04:29.250
more navigable.,00:04:29.250,00:04:30.620
"&gt;&gt; But if you'd rather not follow it
in such detail, you'll find, for",00:04:30.620,00:04:34.550
"instance, this little menu here for 1.5x
speed, 2x speed, or i f I already",00:04:34.550,00:04:39.710
"speak too fast for you, 0.75x speed.",00:04:39.710,00:04:42.100
"So realize all of that is
available there for you.",00:04:42.100,00:04:45.190
"&gt;&gt; But beyond that, for lectures, realize
that we also make these resources",00:04:45.190,00:04:49.120
available as well.,00:04:49.120,00:04:50.530
"Slides, example code, anything that I
do on stage or in advance of class,",00:04:50.530,00:04:55.240
"we'll post there so that you can play
along at home or in Sanders.",00:04:55.240,00:04:58.160
"But what we also thought we'd do this
year for the first time is also",00:04:58.160,00:05:01.280
"provide you with walkthroughs
of these examples.",00:05:01.280,00:05:04.240
"Increasingly, as I've reflected on the
value of CS50's lectures, I've begun",00:05:04.240,00:05:08.120
"to question just how useful it is for
you guys to sit there, for me to stand",00:05:08.120,00:05:11.450
"here, and for me to talk at you,
particularly as the material, the",00:05:11.450,00:05:15.020
"examples, get more complex.",00:05:15.020,00:05:17.020
"Because invariably, after some number of
minutes, someone will zone out, and",00:05:17.020,00:05:20.790
"then you miss some key insight of some
example, and then you're essentially",00:05:20.790,00:05:24.310
"gone for the remaining portion of class,
which is not the best use of",00:05:24.310,00:05:27.720
"your time, or, really, ours
collectively as a class.",00:05:27.720,00:05:31.330
"&gt;&gt; And so what we thought we'd try to do,
particularly for some of the more",00:05:31.330,00:05:33.920
"complex examples that I might not do
justice to in class, that we might not",00:05:33.920,00:05:37.700
"have time for in class, or you might
just zone out during, is we'll produce",00:05:37.700,00:05:41.560
"a series of walkthroughs of these
examples so that if you go to, for",00:05:41.560,00:05:45.500
"instance, last Friday's video page here
under examples, you'll see that",00:05:45.500,00:05:51.410
"for Friday, there's now this
link to walkthroughs.",00:05:51.410,00:05:54.050
"And the format of these
will change over time.",00:05:54.050,00:05:55.780
"For now, we're using a simple
YouTube playlist.",00:05:55.780,00:05:58.080
"&gt;&gt; But what I did with our production team
afterwards was walk through each",00:05:58.080,00:06:00.980
"and every one of those examples again,
hopefully pointing out in much greater",00:06:00.980,00:06:04.480
"clarity exactly what the takeaways
could be or should be from each.",00:06:04.480,00:06:07.550
"So you'll find, for instance, from last
week, all of the scratch examples",00:06:07.550,00:06:10.560
"we went through are done linearly
in that fashion.",00:06:10.560,00:06:12.950
"So feel free to engage or not
engage in this material.",00:06:12.950,00:06:15.840
"Really a theme of this particular course
is that there's probably more",00:06:15.840,00:06:19.140
"in the way of resources than you
could possibly absorb over",00:06:19.140,00:06:21.870
the course of a semester.,00:06:21.870,00:06:23.260
&gt;&gt; But that's deliberate.,00:06:23.260,00:06:23.980
"It's meant to be so that you as
individual students can self-select",00:06:23.980,00:06:26.990
based on your learning style.,00:06:26.990,00:06:28.070
"So if lectures work for you, great.",00:06:28.070,00:06:29.790
"If sections work for you, great.",00:06:29.790,00:06:31.090
"If walkthroughs work for
you better, great.",00:06:31.090,00:06:32.930
"It really will be up to you to choose
what resources work best for you.",00:06:32.930,00:06:36.980
"&gt;&gt; Finally, thanks to an alumnus of the
course, we also provide a canonical",00:06:36.980,00:06:40.380
set of scribe notes.,00:06:40.380,00:06:41.890
"So rather than have you guys heads
down in lectures scribbling down",00:06:41.890,00:06:46.270
"things that come up in class, we, the
staff, will provide you with what we",00:06:46.270,00:06:49.880
"feel are a canonical set of notes to
free you of that distraction, so that",00:06:49.880,00:06:53.410
"if you are here and engaged, you are
truly engaged with what's going on,",00:06:53.410,00:06:57.150
"with your classmates are doing up on
stage, with what's up on the screen,",00:06:57.150,00:07:00.110
"and not simply writing down verbatim
what happened to have been said.",00:07:00.110,00:07:03.570
"So realize all of those resources
are available to you.",00:07:03.570,00:07:06.730
"&gt;&gt; Sectioning, in answer to an FAQ,
will begin this Wednesday.",00:07:06.730,00:07:09.210
"We essentially wait until after most
other classes are done so that we can",00:07:09.210,00:07:12.050
"minimize the number of changes
that we need to do.",00:07:12.050,00:07:14.420
"But coming up this weekend, starting
Sunday, will be a one time instance of",00:07:14.420,00:07:20.010
what we call super sections.,00:07:20.010,00:07:21.360
"These will be filmed for those who can't
attend, and essentially, the",00:07:21.360,00:07:23.990
"course's heads will walk us through some
of the C portion of the course,",00:07:23.990,00:07:28.880
"toward an end of problem set one, which
is going to be our first C based",00:07:28.880,00:07:32.330

have 90 minute sections in a very",00:07:41.600,00:07:45.130

I just graduated in May.,00:09:46.240,00:09:47.430
I was in Kirkland.,00:09:47.430,00:09:49.650
"I'm excited for this semester,
and I hope you are too.",00:09:49.650,00:09:53.670
"&gt;&gt; DAVID MALAN: Thank you to this year's
heads, and to RJ as well.",00:09:53.670,00:09:56.650
&gt;&gt; So a few final notes on resources.,00:09:59.910,00:10:02.310
"One, p set 0 is already up.",00:10:02.310,00:10:04.090
"This one exists only in standard
edition, which is meant for the",00:10:04.090,00:10:06.620
entirety of the class.,00:10:06.620,00:10:07.610
"Starting with p set 1, there will be
hacker editions of most problem sets,",00:10:07.610,00:10:10.940
"which, again, will cover the material
with a bit more of a challenge, while",00:10:10.940,00:10:14.660
"still touching on some
of the same topics.",00:10:14.660,00:10:17.400
"Do take a look at the course's website
for that specification for p set 0.",00:10:17.400,00:10:21.400
"&gt;&gt; Office hours, too, will begin this week,
tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday,",00:10:21.400,00:10:25.140
"and Thursday in various dining
halls on campus.",00:10:25.140,00:10:27.670
"Check out cs50.net/ohs for the office
hours for the course, and realize this",00:10:27.670,00:10:32.140
"will be very casual opportunities,
certainly, at the start of the",00:10:32.140,00:10:34.430
"semester, to come by with your
laptop during brain break.",00:10:34.430,00:10:37.190
"Bring some friends and chat up the
course's TFs and CAs with any",00:10:37.190,00:10:40.500
questions that you might have.,00:10:40.500,00:10:41.750
"&gt;&gt; And I can't emphasize enough, even for
scratch and problem set 0, there",00:10:41.750,00:10:45.320
really is no dumb question.,00:10:45.320,00:10:47.110
"There is no student too uncomfortable
to ask questions.",00:10:47.110,00:10:51.200
"Please feel free to take advantage
of this resource.",00:10:51.200,00:10:53.940
"It will be there recurringly
throughout the semester,",00:10:53.940,00:10:56.430
as will CS50 Discuss.,00:10:56.430,00:10:57.840
"This is the course's online discussion
forums at that address there.",00:10:57.840,00:11:00.900
"&gt;&gt; What we'll also do during lectures is
also monitor this, thanks to the",00:11:00.900,00:11:04.490
course's teaching team.,00:11:04.490,00:11:05.580
"And so if you have a question during
lecture, because I said something",00:11:05.580,00:11:08.390
"poorly or not at all, by all means, ask
that in real time if you have your",00:11:08.390,00:11:11.690
"laptop or phone on the website, and
we'll do our best in near real time to",00:11:11.690,00:11:15.700
respond to that.,00:11:15.700,00:11:17.410
&gt;&gt; Are there any questions about CS 50?,00:11:17.410,00:11:21.500
Then one last notes of mine.,00:11:21.500,00:11:23.930
That issue of SAT UNSAT.,00:11:23.930,00:11:25.530
"As you finalize your study cards, if you
haven't already, realize that the",00:11:25.530,00:11:28.550
"overarching vision of SAT UNSAT,
available for all students, is really",00:11:28.550,00:11:32.360
"to help take the edge off of a course
like this, so to speak, so that if you",00:11:32.360,00:11:36.350
"find yourself late at night, 2AM, 3AM,
really banging your head up against",00:11:36.350,00:11:40.510
"the wall where you know you're 99% of
the way there to completion, but you",00:11:40.510,00:11:43.960
"have so many other things to do,
I think a better use, often, of",00:11:43.960,00:11:47.510
"students' time is to indeed move on to
those other things so that you can",00:11:47.510,00:11:51.260
optimize your time all around.,00:11:51.260,00:11:52.780
"And SAT UNSAT is one mechanism via which
you can take comfort in the fact",00:11:52.780,00:11:56.950
"that 99% of the way there is
still pretty darn good.",00:11:56.950,00:12:00.530
"&gt;&gt; Similarly, too, if you've come into the
course with no prior background or",00:12:00.530,00:12:03.790
"not nearly as much background as you
think your classmates might have, true",00:12:03.790,00:12:07.960
"or false, realize that this is an
opportunity to get your hands dirty",00:12:07.960,00:12:13.210
"with the course, put your toes in the
water, so to speak, much like I myself",00:12:13.210,00:12:16.590
did years ago with pass/fail.,00:12:16.590,00:12:18.500
"As I said last week, had this course,
like others, not been available",00:12:18.500,00:12:21.850
"pass/fail at the time, I probably would
not have ever stepped foot in",00:12:21.850,00:12:25.090
"the class, even though I did, five weeks
later, change my mind, which you",00:12:25.090,00:12:28.310
"may as well, and switch over to
or from letter graded status.",00:12:28.310,00:12:32.400
&gt;&gt; All right.,00:12:32.400,00:12:32.990
"So we looked at things like this on
Friday, and we're very quickly going",00:12:32.990,00:12:37.380
"to transition to something that
looks more cryptic today.",00:12:37.380,00:12:39.890
"But it's nonetheless the
same fundamental idea.",00:12:39.890,00:12:42.300
"What was the general term that we
used to describe a puzzle piece",00:12:42.300,00:12:45.540
that looked like this?,00:12:45.540,00:12:47.690
"&gt;&gt; So, a statement.",00:12:47.690,00:12:48.510
"And you can call this any
number of things.",00:12:48.510,00:12:50.020
"But we'll just call it a statement,
and a statement",00:12:50.020,00:12:51.870
just tells the program--,00:12:51.870,00:12:53.200
"or in the case of Scratch,
the sprite--",00:12:53.200,00:12:55.290
to do something.,00:12:55.290,00:12:56.520
Say hello in this case.,00:12:56.520,00:12:58.430
"&gt;&gt; Something like this we
instead called what?",00:12:58.430,00:13:01.450
"Yeah, so a Boolean expression.",00:13:01.450,00:13:03.560
"A Boolean expression is just something
that is true or false, and so Scratch",00:13:03.560,00:13:07.380
"draws them with this shape, but also
with a question mark to convey the",00:13:07.380,00:13:10.530
"idea that the answer to this question
is either true or false, yes or no",00:13:10.530,00:13:14.510
"one, 1 or 0.",00:13:14.510,00:13:15.910
"&gt;&gt; And we use these Boolean expressions
inside of constructs like these, which",00:13:15.910,00:13:19.290
we called what?,00:13:19.290,00:13:21.010
"So, condition or branch.",00:13:21.010,00:13:22.460
"And the condition you see here in
Scratch has a little placeholder for a",00:13:22.460,00:13:25.600
"puzzle piece of that shape, the purpose
of which is so that you can",00:13:25.600,00:13:28.260
"drag it and drop it on top and then
dictate to the program if this Boolean",00:13:28.260,00:13:32.670
"expression is true, do this set of
instructions, this set of statements,",00:13:32.670,00:13:36.410
"else do this other set
of instructions.",00:13:36.410,00:13:39.320
"&gt;&gt; And recall that you can
nest these things.",00:13:39.320,00:13:41.270
"Even though there's not much room
visually in that puzzle piece, Scratch",00:13:41.270,00:13:44.170
"will grow and shrink to fit whatever
puzzle pieces you drag and drop in",00:13:44.170,00:13:47.820
"there so you can actually nest this and
have a three way fork in the road.",00:13:47.820,00:13:51.410
"If, else if, else.",00:13:51.410,00:13:53.870
"And you can even go beyond that by
nesting further and further as needed.",00:13:53.870,00:13:58.100
"&gt;&gt; So lastly, we saw constructs like
this, otherwise known as a loop.",00:13:58.100,00:14:02.520
"And this is just something that does
something again and again and again.",00:14:02.520,00:14:05.690
"In this case, it happens to be a finite
number of times, but we also",00:14:05.690,00:14:09.250
"saw an example where the number of
times came from a variable, so it",00:14:09.250,00:14:12.890
could change.,00:14:12.890,00:14:13.690
"And we also saw another block altogether
called a forever block that",00:14:13.690,00:14:16.910
allowed us to loop infinitely long.,00:14:16.910,00:14:19.590
"&gt;&gt; So one other construct that Scratch
2.0 has-- and those of you more",00:14:19.590,00:14:23.300
"comfortable with prior background are
already well familiar with this",00:14:23.300,00:14:26.330
construct--,00:14:26.330,00:14:27.080
these things we called what?,00:14:27.080,00:14:29.910
"So we called these functions, otherwise
known as procedures.",00:14:29.910,00:14:32.540
"There's a slight semantic difference,
but we'll call them just functions.",00:14:32.540,00:14:35.030
"&gt;&gt; And a function, in the case of Scratch,
is a custom puzzle piece that",00:14:35.030,00:14:39.950
"you yourself can create so that you have
a new puzzle piece that, in this",00:14:39.950,00:14:43.670
"case, would be called cough, that
appears among all of the other",00:14:43.670,00:14:47.190
available puzzle pieces in Scratch.,00:14:47.190,00:14:48.730
"Even though MIT didn't invent
this puzzle piece, you did.",00:14:48.730,00:14:52.010
"&gt;&gt; So a function allows you to create new
behavior, give it a function name, and",00:14:52.010,00:14:57.600
"then call it, so to speak.",00:14:57.600,00:14:59.200
"Really use it in programs again and
again and again without having to wait",00:14:59.200,00:15:04.690
"for someone like MIT down the road to
invent new functionality from Scratch.",00:15:04.690,00:15:08.600
"You yourself can build these puzzle
pieces yourself, and then reuse them",00:15:08.600,00:15:12.460
in your own programs.,00:15:12.460,00:15:13.600
"And we'll see a recurring example
of that today and onward.",00:15:13.600,00:15:17.520
"&gt;&gt; So today, we transition now
to something more arcane.",00:15:17.520,00:15:20.960
"But at the end of the day, something
more powerful and expressive and more",00:15:20.960,00:15:24.350
"representative of the path that we'll be
on all semester throughout a number",00:15:24.350,00:15:28.110
of languages--,00:15:28.110,00:15:28.800
that of code or source code.,00:15:28.800,00:15:30.800
"And source code, it turns out,
is not what a computer",00:15:30.800,00:15:34.720
typically actually runs.,00:15:34.720,00:15:37.400
Source code looks something like this.,00:15:37.400,00:15:39.860
"&gt;&gt; So this is, again, perhaps the simplest
program we can write in a",00:15:39.860,00:15:43.010
"language called C. We will start to
tease this apart before long, and if",00:15:43.010,00:15:46.670
"this really does look like Greek
to you right now, trust me.",00:15:46.670,00:15:49.260
"Within just a week or two's time, this
will be all too familiar and actually",00:15:49.260,00:15:54.040
"quite representative of increasingly
complex examples with which you'll",00:15:54.040,00:15:57.780
also get more comfortable.,00:15:57.780,00:15:59.870
"&gt;&gt; But you can't just run this
kind of code usually.",00:15:59.870,00:16:03.100
"You have to turn it into something that
the computer itself understands.",00:16:03.100,00:16:06.750
"And so for that, we need something
we're going to call a compiler.",00:16:06.750,00:16:09.840
"A compiler is a program that takes
source code, like you just saw, as",00:16:09.840,00:16:13.910
"input, and it produces zeroes and
ones as output, otherwise",00:16:13.910,00:16:17.680
known as object code.,00:16:17.680,00:16:19.210
"And it's those zeroes and ones that
might look quite like this that",00:16:19.210,00:16:23.190
"ultimately are understood
by your Mac or your PC.",00:16:23.190,00:16:26.310
"&gt;&gt; If you've ever heard the marketing
expression Intel Inside, that just",00:16:26.310,00:16:30.050
"means that a company called
Intel has manufactured the",00:16:30.050,00:16:32.800
brains of your computer--,00:16:32.800,00:16:34.130
"otherwise known as the CPU,
central processing unit--",00:16:34.130,00:16:37.270
"and that's just the thing that
understands patterns",00:16:37.270,00:16:39.640
of zeroes and ones.,00:16:39.640,00:16:40.880
"And so by converting source code into
object code through this process here",00:16:40.880,00:16:46.330
"that we'll do with a couple of commands
in just a bit, you are",00:16:46.330,00:16:49.130
"creating patterns of zeroes and ones
that the employees at Intel have",00:16:49.130,00:16:53.070
decided represent certain statements.,00:16:53.070,00:16:56.000
"&gt;&gt; Now, I don't quite know which
is which by just glancing at",00:16:56.000,00:16:58.810
these zeroes and ones.,00:16:58.810,00:16:59.890
Most humans these days don't.,00:16:59.890,00:17:01.420
"But somewhere in there is a pattern of
zeroes and ones that represents the",00:17:01.420,00:17:04.900
statement print.,00:17:04.900,00:17:06.349
"Somewhere in there could be a different
set of zeroes and ones that",00:17:06.349,00:17:10.460
"represent the notion of forever or
repeat 10 times or even meow, if it's",00:17:10.460,00:17:16.940
"actually a program that can
include some sounds.",00:17:16.940,00:17:20.000
"&gt;&gt; So in short, humans have just decided,
much like we did for ASCII--",00:17:20.000,00:17:24.390
"for letters of the alphabet last week--
humans have decided that even",00:17:24.390,00:17:27.480
"more complex patterns of zeroes and ones
represent more complex behavior",00:17:27.480,00:17:32.200
like printing or saying or meowing.,00:17:32.200,00:17:35.650
"And so for today, and largely onward
in the semester, we'll take for",00:17:35.650,00:17:38.640
"granted that someone has figured
out how to do that mapping.",00:17:38.640,00:17:41.820
"But we, consistent with this idea of
layering on top of the work of people",00:17:41.820,00:17:45.560
"who've come before us, will take for
granted the fact that this is going on",00:17:45.560,00:17:49.340
underneath the hood.,00:17:49.340,00:17:50.300
"But we're much more interested in
building things that are more",00:17:50.300,00:17:53.840
interesting on top of all this.,00:17:53.840,00:17:55.880
"&gt;&gt; And so indeed, the first program we
wrote in Scratch was this super simple",00:17:55.880,00:17:58.900
"one, Hello World.",00:17:58.900,00:18:00.600
"And you can think of this as being the
main program that governs Scratch's",00:18:00.600,00:18:05.100
behavior as of last Friday.,00:18:05.100,00:18:07.280
"&gt;&gt; Today, we're going to start to translate
Scratch puzzle pieces into",00:18:07.280,00:18:11.510
"source code in this language called
C so that what looked like this on",00:18:11.510,00:18:16.040
"Friday, starting today onward, is
now going to look like this.",00:18:16.040,00:18:20.230
Admittedly more cryptic.,00:18:20.230,00:18:21.860
"It's pretty distracting and sort of mind
numbing to see all of the quotes",00:18:21.860,00:18:25.010
"and the semicolons and the
parentheses and so forth.",00:18:25.010,00:18:27.760
"&gt;&gt; But if you start to ignore anything you
don't understand, and really look",00:18:27.760,00:18:32.350
"at the essence of the white text on the
screen, surely you see, like I do,",00:18:32.350,00:18:35.960
"""hello, world."" That lines up with the
purple statement up top, and it turns",00:18:35.960,00:18:40.360
"out that the keyword main is going to
line up conceptually with when green",00:18:40.360,00:18:44.790
flag clicked.,00:18:44.790,00:18:46.350
"&gt;&gt; So in other words, whereas in Scratch,
we implement this Hello World program",00:18:46.350,00:18:49.820
"with those two puzzle pieces, in C,
we're going to implement it with these",00:18:49.820,00:18:53.360
four somewhat cryptic lines.,00:18:53.360,00:18:55.510
"But as we dive deeper into this, you'll
see that each one of those",00:18:55.510,00:18:58.130
"white characters on the screen actually
has some significant meaning,",00:18:58.130,00:19:02.730
"and most of our programs are going to
look structurally quite the same.",00:19:02.730,00:19:05.880
"So a statement, to be clear, what
looked like ""say hello world"" on",00:19:05.880,00:19:08.980
"Friday is going to start looking
like this on Monday.",00:19:08.980,00:19:12.020
"printf (""hello, world"").",00:19:12.020,00:19:15.250
"And there's some weird backslash
n, there's parentheses, there's",00:19:15.250,00:19:17.700
semicolons.,00:19:17.700,00:19:18.490
"&gt;&gt; But at the end of the day, the key
takeaway today is that all we're doing",00:19:18.490,00:19:21.950
"is translating things from picture
form to text form.",00:19:21.950,00:19:25.710
"So a loop that looked like this
last week is going to now look",00:19:25.710,00:19:28.820
something like this.,00:19:28.820,00:19:30.140
"&gt;&gt; And let me disclaim, just like in
Scratch, there's different ways to",00:19:30.140,00:19:33.020
achieve the same goal.,00:19:33.020,00:19:34.110
"Same in C. I'm not showing you the only
way to do things, but one way to",00:19:34.110,00:19:38.860
"translate this forever
block to a loop in C.",00:19:38.860,00:19:43.230
"&gt;&gt; This one here, repeat 10 times.",00:19:43.230,00:19:44.980
"This one really kind of bends the
mind the first time you see it.",00:19:44.980,00:19:47.580
"But to implement that henceforth,
we're going to use a",00:19:47.580,00:19:49.860
"for loop, so to speak.",00:19:49.860,00:19:51.990
"And clearly there's some syntax that's
a little complex there with I and",00:19:51.990,00:19:56.150
"equal and 0, but once we dive into that
today onward, you're just going",00:19:56.150,00:19:59.740
"to see that that's all simply doing some
basic arithmetic to get us from 0",00:19:59.740,00:20:04.260
on up to 9 or 10 in this case.,00:20:04.260,00:20:07.720
"&gt;&gt; Lastly, with variables, you'll recall
that a variable is a piece of storage.",00:20:07.720,00:20:11.570
"Well, what we had on the left there last
week is going to look a little",00:20:11.570,00:20:14.290
something like this this week.,00:20:14.290,00:20:15.920
"But again, more on that to come.",00:20:15.920,00:20:17.870
"&gt;&gt; We had Boolean expressions, which
last week, looked like this.",00:20:17.870,00:20:20.700
"This week onward, they're going to
start to look a little like that.",00:20:20.700,00:20:23.370
"&gt;&gt; And this one's actually
a little reassuring.",00:20:23.370,00:20:24.890
"It's actually almost as simple
as the green blocks.",00:20:24.890,00:20:27.680
"But here we have, again, some new syntax
with ampersands, but you can",00:20:27.680,00:20:31.115
"perhaps guess whereas in Scratch, you
say A-N-D, apparently in C, we're",00:20:31.115,00:20:35.390
going to say ampersand ampersand.,00:20:35.390,00:20:37.070
"But all of this will become
natural before long.",00:20:37.070,00:20:39.650
&gt;&gt; Conditions.,00:20:39.650,00:20:40.680
"Last week, it looked like
this on the left.",00:20:40.680,00:20:42.610
"This week, on the right, it's
going to look like that.",00:20:42.610,00:20:44.800
"But again, the key takeaway here is that
as you see things like that on",00:20:44.800,00:20:48.560
"the right, and especially if less
comfortable, it's sort of over your",00:20:48.560,00:20:51.950
"head, you get a little overwhelmed that
I really have no idea how I could",00:20:51.950,00:20:54.950
"possibly come up with
that from scratch--",00:20:54.950,00:20:58.420
no pun intended--,00:20:58.420,00:20:59.500
"just realize that it's really the same
idea that probably felt so much more",00:20:59.500,00:21:05.300
natural the previous week.,00:21:05.300,00:21:06.760
"And even if you haven't dived into
problem set 0, I daresay you'll find",00:21:06.760,00:21:10.960
"that the puzzle pieces are fairly
intuitive, or at least",00:21:10.960,00:21:13.790
become so over time.,00:21:13.790,00:21:16.050
&gt;&gt; So let's dive in.,00:21:16.050,00:21:16.990
"Let's get our hands dirty here with
this first simple program.",00:21:16.990,00:21:20.760
"And simple is, of course, relative.",00:21:20.760,00:21:22.410
"To do this, I'm going to change screens
to that device I called the",00:21:22.410,00:21:25.190
CS50 appliance.,00:21:25.190,00:21:26.150
"The CS50 appliance is a piece of
software that's running inside a",00:21:26.150,00:21:29.700
"window on my Mac, and you can also run
it in a window inside of your PC, that",00:21:29.700,00:21:33.920
"allows me to have the same exact
computer environment as every TF, as",00:21:33.920,00:21:38.720
"every CA, as every student
in the class.",00:21:38.720,00:21:40.940
"Because the CS50 appliance is literally
another operating system",00:21:40.940,00:21:44.590
called Linux--,00:21:44.590,00:21:45.410
specifically Fedora Linux--,00:21:45.410,00:21:47.160
"and we, the staff, have configured
the installation process for this",00:21:47.160,00:21:51.320
"operating system in such a way that one,
there's a little CS50 logo in the",00:21:51.320,00:21:55.200
"middle, two, there's a custom menu at
the bottom, and three, pedagogically,",00:21:55.200,00:21:59.240
"we've simplified the user interface as
much as possible so that when you",00:21:59.240,00:22:02.570
"first boot this thing up on your own
Mac or PC, you have the same",00:22:02.570,00:22:05.540
"environment as everyone else, and you
have all of the tools that you need",00:22:05.540,00:22:08.280
"for the course without having to figure
out how to install each and",00:22:08.280,00:22:11.390
every tool individually.,00:22:11.390,00:22:13.280
"&gt;&gt; So this looks relatively
like Mac OS or Windows.",00:22:13.280,00:22:15.840
"In the bottom left hand corner, you
essentially have a Start menu of",00:22:15.840,00:22:18.760
"sorts, or an Apple menu.",00:22:18.760,00:22:20.280
"And then you have what we suspect will
be your three most common icons.",00:22:20.280,00:22:23.700
One is Chrome.,00:22:23.700,00:22:24.460
"There's a browser inside
of the appliance.",00:22:24.460,00:22:26.460
"&gt;&gt; Two is a program called gedit, which
we saw briefly last week, which is",00:22:26.460,00:22:29.970
just a graphical editor.,00:22:29.970,00:22:31.310
"And three is a Terminal program, which
is a black and white window from",00:22:31.310,00:22:35.350
"yesteryear that allows us to type more
arcane but more powerful commands at",00:22:35.350,00:22:39.860
our keyboard.,00:22:39.860,00:22:40.660
"So I'm going to go ahead and click on
gedit, and rest assured that problem",00:22:40.660,00:22:44.220
"set 1, to be released on Friday, will
walk you through all these same steps.",00:22:44.220,00:22:48.520
"&gt;&gt; Notice that I have a pretty simple
user interface with three parts.",00:22:48.520,00:22:51.730
"On the left, I have a big empty
window called source code.",00:22:51.730,00:22:54.990
"That's where I'm going to see a summary
of any code that I write.",00:22:54.990,00:22:58.930
"On the right hand side, I have a big
tab, currently unsaved, and that's",00:22:58.930,00:23:01.990
where my code's going to go.,00:23:01.990,00:23:03.510
"And on the bottom, I have an embedded
Terminal window, a black and white",00:23:03.510,00:23:06.780
"prompt at which I can type commands to
compile and to run my programs-- that",00:23:06.780,00:23:12.060
"is, to make and to run my programs.",00:23:12.060,00:23:14.110
&gt;&gt; So let's start simple.,00:23:14.110,00:23:15.170
"Let me go up to File, Save.",00:23:15.170,00:23:17.700
"I'm going to go ahead and
go into jharvard.",00:23:17.700,00:23:20.530
"So the appliance, irrespective of what
your name is, belongs to a guy named",00:23:20.530,00:23:24.320
"John Harvard, who has a jharvard home
directory inside of which all of your",00:23:24.320,00:23:28.250
files will go.,00:23:28.250,00:23:29.100
"It's your own copy of his account,
so we're not all sharing",00:23:29.100,00:23:31.640
the same hard drive.,00:23:31.640,00:23:33.530
"You just have the illusion
of John Harvard's own.",00:23:33.530,00:23:35.580
"&gt;&gt; In advance, I actually
installed Dropbox.",00:23:35.580,00:23:38.350
"The appliance comes preprepared with
Dropbox so that if anything goes wrong",00:23:38.350,00:23:42.600
"during the semester, if you've
configured your appliance with a free",00:23:42.600,00:23:45.950
"Dropbox account, all of your files will
be automatically backed up so you",00:23:45.950,00:23:48.950
can very easily recover them.,00:23:48.950,00:23:50.430
"And I'm going to go into my Dropbox
directory, and there's already going",00:23:50.430,00:23:53.980
to be a couple other things there.,00:23:53.980,00:23:55.530
"&gt;&gt; But I'm going to go ahead
and go to File, Save.",00:23:55.530,00:24:02.090
"I'm going to go into jharvard, Dropbox,
and up here, I'm going to",00:24:02.090,00:24:05.930
"give my program a super simple
name, hello.c, and then save.",00:24:05.930,00:24:10.590
So I have the same interface now.,00:24:10.590,00:24:11.810
"The only thing that's changed
is the tab up top.",00:24:11.810,00:24:14.190
"So I'm very quickly going to recreate
that program from the",00:24:14.190,00:24:17.170
slides a moment ago.,00:24:17.170,00:24:19.060
"&gt;&gt; So into main(void), and then printf,
""hello, world,"" a somewhat cryptic",00:24:19.060,00:24:25.690
"backslash n, close quote, close
parenthesis, semicolon, and",00:24:25.690,00:24:29.920
then Ctrl S to save.,00:24:29.920,00:24:32.030
"And notice as an aside what just
appeared here on the top left.",00:24:32.030,00:24:34.860
"And this is not useful today, but
will be useful over time.",00:24:34.860,00:24:37.490
"You just see, again, a summary of
the code that you've written.",00:24:37.490,00:24:40.160
"And because I wrote something called
main, that's why the word main popped",00:24:40.160,00:24:43.320
up over there.,00:24:43.320,00:24:44.030
"But for the most part, we
don't need that today.",00:24:44.030,00:24:46.610
"&gt;&gt; All right, so I claim that this is my
first program written in a programming",00:24:46.610,00:24:51.130
"language called C. We know from Friday
that what this thing is going to do",00:24:51.130,00:24:54.620
"very uninterestingly when I
run it is just display--",00:24:54.620,00:24:58.450
"in other words, print, as a computer
scientist would say--",00:24:58.450,00:25:01.270
hello world on the screen.,00:25:01.270,00:25:03.310
"So to do this, you'll notice that I have
to go down here to my terminal",00:25:03.310,00:25:06.800
"window, and now I have
a blinking prompt.",00:25:06.800,00:25:09.250
"But this is now a keyboard version of
my John Harvard home directory.",00:25:09.250,00:25:15.480
"It's a keyboard way via which
to navigate my hard drive.",00:25:15.480,00:25:19.610
"&gt;&gt; So I can't actually type like I did
last week make hello, because it's",00:25:19.610,00:25:25.380
going to say no rule to make target--,00:25:25.380,00:25:27.230
something's wrong.,00:25:27.230,00:25:27.950
"I don't quite know what that message
means, but that's because by default,",00:25:27.950,00:25:31.690
"when this black and white window is
opened, I'm inside of John Harvard's",00:25:31.690,00:25:35.350
home directory.,00:25:35.350,00:25:36.160
But where did I save that program?,00:25:36.160,00:25:39.180
In my Dropbox folder.,00:25:39.180,00:25:40.440
"&gt;&gt; Now, all of us have grown up with
computers where you just double click",00:25:40.440,00:25:43.110
"on a folder's icon, it
opens up, and voila.",00:25:43.110,00:25:45.610
"That's where the file called
hello.c would be.",00:25:45.610,00:25:48.280
"So in fact, let's do that.",00:25:48.280,00:25:49.470
"&gt;&gt; Let me go ahead and minimize gedit
just like you would on",00:25:49.470,00:25:51.610
Windows or Mac OS.,00:25:51.610,00:25:52.990
"Let me go into the Home
folder at top left.",00:25:52.990,00:25:56.160
I'll see here a bunch of folders.,00:25:56.160,00:25:57.620
Here's my Dropbox folder.,00:25:57.620,00:25:58.870
The checkmarks means it's been synced.,00:25:58.870,00:26:00.770
"And there's a few things in here,
but notice that hello.c is",00:26:00.770,00:26:04.040
indeed right there.,00:26:04.040,00:26:04.960
"&gt;&gt; And so in Mac OS or Windows, normally,
I'd double click that, it opens up in",00:26:04.960,00:26:08.050
"whatever program, and I'm good to go.",00:26:08.050,00:26:10.220
"But now, at least starting today, we
need to take a step backwards just to",00:26:10.220,00:26:13.370
"give you some basic tools for your
tool kit with which to do more",00:26:13.370,00:26:16.960
powerful things before long.,00:26:16.960,00:26:18.980
"&gt;&gt; So at this prompt, I have to do the
equivalent of double clicking the",00:26:18.980,00:26:22.280
Dropbox folder.,00:26:22.280,00:26:23.560
"And to do that, I'm going to type CD for
change directory, Dropbox, enter.",00:26:23.560,00:26:29.900
"And now notice the parentheses at my
so-called prompt now says that I'm in",00:26:29.900,00:26:36.100
"tilde, the little squiggly
symbol at the top left of",00:26:36.100,00:26:38.470
"most keyboards, /Dropbox.",00:26:38.470,00:26:40.860
"This is just shorthand notation for
saying human, you are now inside of",00:26:40.860,00:26:45.200
"the Dropbox folder, just as though
you had double clicked on it.",00:26:45.200,00:26:48.650
"&gt;&gt; So now if I go ahead and type make
hello, enter, I see a very cryptic",00:26:48.650,00:26:54.610
"command, but not an error message,
it seems, and then",00:26:54.610,00:26:57.450
another blinking prompt.,00:26:57.450,00:26:59.020
"And if you recall, ever so quickly
on Friday, we did this. ./hello.",00:26:59.020,00:27:04.470
"&gt;&gt; What you're about to see is the result
of my running this program, or, in Mac",00:27:04.470,00:27:10.000
"OS and PC terms, if I'd normally double
click on a program-- a .app",00:27:10.000,00:27:14.310
"program or a .exe, it opens
a window and runs.",00:27:14.310,00:27:17.620
"Typing ./hello is just like double
clicking a program to run it, but",00:27:17.620,00:27:21.920
using my keyboard.,00:27:21.920,00:27:23.280
"&gt;&gt; Enter, hello world.",00:27:23.280,00:27:25.410
And that's it.,00:27:25.410,00:27:26.150
"So let's tease this apart to so it
doesn't feel too much like Greek.",00:27:26.150,00:27:29.150
&gt;&gt; So ./ means what?,00:27:29.150,00:27:31.370
"Anyone who's ever navigated a keyboard
environment like this, what's dot",00:27:31.370,00:27:34.120
referring to?,00:27:34.120,00:27:36.690
The current directory.,00:27:36.690,00:27:37.800
"&gt;&gt; So the current directory is just
a synonym for a folder.",00:27:37.800,00:27:41.320
"So by saying dot slash, I am saying,
look for a program called hello in the",00:27:41.320,00:27:46.230
current directory--,00:27:46.230,00:27:47.250
in the current folder.,00:27:47.250,00:27:48.540
"In other words, my Dropbox folder.",00:27:48.540,00:27:50.480
"And that's why hitting Enter thereafter
actually runs that program.",00:27:50.480,00:27:54.220
"&gt;&gt; If I now type LS, notice that I see
everything in my Dropbox folder.",00:27:54.220,00:27:58.790
"Getting Started.pdf, which Dropbox
gives you for free, my photos",00:27:58.790,00:28:02.000
"directory, a public directory, Unsaved
Document 1 which I made by mistake a",00:28:02.000,00:28:05.450
"moment ago, foo.c, which I made earlier
today, and then two lines--",00:28:05.450,00:28:09.730
hello.c and hello.,00:28:09.730,00:28:12.090
"&gt;&gt; Hello.c is the program I wrote with
gedit, and what is hello in green?",00:28:12.090,00:28:17.280
The hello in green is the executable.,00:28:20.920,00:28:22.940
"In other words, when I ran this command
a moment ago-- let me roll",00:28:22.940,00:28:27.020
back in time--,00:28:27.020,00:28:28.040
"when I ran make hello, that's
the middle step here.",00:28:28.040,00:28:32.400
And it took hello.c as input--,00:28:32.400,00:28:34.410
"AKA source code-- and it produced a
file called hello as output, which",00:28:34.410,00:28:39.910
contains all of these zeros and ones.,00:28:39.910,00:28:42.510
"And that's why, in the end, I can
actually run a command like ./hello.",00:28:42.510,00:28:47.640
"Because of Intel Inside, my operating
system, Linux, opens up those zeros",00:28:47.640,00:28:53.310
"and ones, feeds them into the
brains of my computer--",00:28:53.310,00:28:55.820

"and that CPU knows, oh, here's a pattern
of zeros and ones that says",00:28:56.580,00:29:00.460
"print the following thing
on the screen.",00:29:00.460,00:29:02.800
&gt;&gt; What's the following thing?,00:29:02.800,00:29:04.450
"Quote unquote, ""hello world.""",00:29:04.450,00:29:07.650
"&gt;&gt; All right, so a quick summary of some of
these commands so that we can start",00:29:07.650,00:29:12.100
taking them for granted.,00:29:12.100,00:29:13.350
"Let me skip ahead to
where we left off.",00:29:13.350,00:29:15.550
"And you'll recall that we had CD
at our back end a moment ago.",00:29:15.550,00:29:22.230
"These are, I dare say, for
today's purposes--",00:29:22.230,00:29:24.880
"maybe this week-- the only commands we
might need to type at the command",00:29:24.880,00:29:29.010
prompt besides make.,00:29:29.010,00:29:30.580
&gt;&gt; So CD stood for what?,00:29:30.580,00:29:34.510
Change directory.,00:29:34.510,00:29:35.180
"It's just the equivalent of double
clicking on a folder.",00:29:35.180,00:29:38.010
"And as an aside, if you get
lost ever inside of your",00:29:38.010,00:29:41.320
"appliance, such that Dropbox--",00:29:41.320,00:29:43.430
"I want to get back to my
jharvard directory--",00:29:43.430,00:29:45.420
"when in doubt, CD, enter, with no other
words, and it just zips you back",00:29:45.420,00:29:50.490
"to where you started, which
is a nice little shortcut.",00:29:50.490,00:29:53.110
"&gt;&gt; All right, so now other commands.",00:29:53.110,00:29:54.840
LS.,00:29:54.840,00:29:55.660
I typed that a moment ago.,00:29:55.660,00:29:56.840
What do you think LS stands for?,00:29:56.840,00:29:59.500
"&gt;&gt; So, list, right?",00:29:59.500,00:30:00.470
"Back in the day, when humans were coming
up with these commands, they",00:30:00.470,00:30:03.300
"were trying to be efficient, and rather
type out L-I-S-T enter, they",00:30:03.300,00:30:07.180
decided LS.,00:30:07.180,00:30:08.470
That's fine.,00:30:08.470,00:30:09.080
It sounds enough like list.,00:30:09.080,00:30:10.420
"Let's just type LS enter, and that
lists the files or folders in my",00:30:10.420,00:30:13.870
current folder.,00:30:13.870,00:30:15.000
"&gt;&gt; mkdir, you can probably guess.",00:30:15.000,00:30:17.530
Make directory.,00:30:17.530,00:30:18.440
"So you don't go to some file menu and
choose New Folder in this environment.",00:30:18.440,00:30:22.010
"Rather, you type the command mkdir space
and then the name of the folder",00:30:22.010,00:30:27.410
"that you want to create,
and it will be done.",00:30:27.410,00:30:29.850
"&gt;&gt; rm, you can probably guess.",00:30:29.850,00:30:32.380
Remove or delete.,00:30:32.380,00:30:33.480
"So if you want to delete a file, you'll
see in the problem set how you",00:30:33.480,00:30:36.740
can do this.,00:30:36.740,00:30:37.240
"And rmdir, remove directory.",00:30:37.240,00:30:39.510
"&gt;&gt; So, again, I'll tend to fly through some
of these details, one, because",00:30:39.510,00:30:42.320
"they're not all that much fun to spend
time on, but two, we'll provide you in",00:30:42.320,00:30:46.010
"much greater detail in any of the
course's problem sets, particularly",00:30:46.010,00:30:48.720
"the standard editions, any of the steps
that you might need to type so",00:30:48.720,00:30:52.370
"that you get more and more
comfy with these things.",00:30:52.370,00:30:54.830
"&gt;&gt; But now let me tease apart
one other thing.",00:30:54.830,00:30:57.430
"When we typed make hello a moment ago,
we saw a cryptic sequence of commands.",00:30:57.430,00:31:02.580
"We saw, again, make hello.",00:31:02.580,00:31:04.805
"OK, let's do this.",00:31:07.640,00:31:08.520
"I was about to make a mistake, but
[INAUDIBLE] now admit I was about to",00:31:08.520,00:31:11.840
and do it deliberately.,00:31:11.840,00:31:14.400
&gt;&gt; What did I do wrong just now?,00:31:14.400,00:31:15.810
"Yeah, so I'm not in the Dropbox
directory, because a moment ago I",00:31:18.680,00:31:21.060
typed CD and just hit enter.,00:31:21.060,00:31:22.720
"That zoomed me back to where I started,
which is not where my file",00:31:22.720,00:31:25.480
"is, so I really need to do CD Dropbox
enter, and now I can do rm hello",00:31:25.480,00:31:31.720
"enter, remove regular file hello.",00:31:31.720,00:31:34.060
I don't know why it's so cryptic.,00:31:34.060,00:31:35.200
"That just means are you sure
you want to delete hello?",00:31:35.200,00:31:37.600
"You can type y for yes, enter,
and now it's gone.",00:31:37.600,00:31:41.510
"&gt;&gt; And now if I type make hello again, it's
going to recreate my object code,",00:31:41.510,00:31:46.010
recreate those zeros and ones.,00:31:46.010,00:31:47.460
"But what is the deal with
this very long command?",00:31:47.460,00:31:51.070
"Well, we'll tease this apart
before long, but make--",00:31:51.070,00:31:53.960
I told a bit of a white lie before--,00:31:53.960,00:31:55.500
is not a compiler.,00:31:55.500,00:31:56.880
"Make is a program that automatically
figures out how to run a",00:31:56.880,00:32:00.350
compiler for you.,00:32:00.350,00:32:02.060
"&gt;&gt; So the command that you really should be
running in order to convert hello.c",00:32:02.060,00:32:07.490
"into hello actually looks
a little more like this.",00:32:07.490,00:32:11.240
"And God forbid we have to actually
remember to ever type that whole",00:32:11.240,00:32:15.900
sequence of commands out.,00:32:15.900,00:32:17.280
"The purpose of make in life is to
remember that degree of complexity for",00:32:17.280,00:32:21.360
"us and automate what would otherwise
be very tedious steps.",00:32:21.360,00:32:24.470
&gt;&gt; But I can approximate that.,00:32:24.470,00:32:26.040
"So per this little cheat sheet here, I
can approximate what that command is",00:32:26.040,00:32:29.960
"doing by simply typing clang, which is
the name of the compiler we'll be",00:32:29.960,00:32:33.960
using this semester.,00:32:33.960,00:32:35.170
"If any of you have ever done iOS
development for the iPhone or iPad,",00:32:35.170,00:32:38.500
"Clang is the program you've used
within xcode to make your apps.",00:32:38.500,00:32:42.930
"Clang, though, is just another program
whose name we can type at the command",00:32:42.930,00:32:46.360
"prompt, and by introducing this now,
I can introduce something that's a",00:32:46.360,00:32:49.210
"little representative
of commands to come.",00:32:49.210,00:32:52.410
So let me do this manually.,00:32:52.410,00:32:53.910
"&gt;&gt; So rm hello, and now notice in case
I, just as a sanity check--",00:32:53.910,00:32:59.240
"./hello, what do you think I
should see if I do this?",00:32:59.240,00:33:03.180
Some kind of error.,00:33:03.180,00:33:04.060
No such file directory.,00:33:04.060,00:33:05.110
So that one's actually pretty direct.,00:33:05.110,00:33:06.740
&gt;&gt; So now let me clear the screen.,00:33:06.740,00:33:08.110
"Control S just clears the screen
to remove some distractions.",00:33:08.110,00:33:11.370
"And now I'm going to manually
type clang -o hello hello.c.",00:33:11.370,00:33:17.160
So what is this about to do?,00:33:17.160,00:33:18.890
"Exactly the same thing that make did for
us, but I did throw away some of",00:33:18.890,00:33:23.820
the superfluous words.,00:33:23.820,00:33:25.430
"&gt;&gt; Clang is the program that's going to
take a .c file as input and produce",00:33:25.430,00:33:28.570
zeros and ones as output.,00:33:28.570,00:33:30.110
"But -o henceforth will call
a switch or a flag.",00:33:30.110,00:33:35.120
"This is just techie jargon for saying
this is a word you type at a prompt",00:33:35.120,00:33:39.080
"that somehow influences the behavior
of the program you're running.",00:33:39.080,00:33:42.590
"So does anyone want to guess
what -o conveys?",00:33:42.590,00:33:47.180
&gt;&gt; Output.,00:33:47.180,00:33:47.840
"It's just someone decided -o means
output a file called hello and take as",00:33:47.840,00:33:52.670
"input whatever the last word on the
prompt is, hello.c, so that if I hit",00:33:52.670,00:33:56.440
"Enter now, nothing seems to happen.",00:33:56.440,00:33:58.930
"And oddly enough, in this world of
programming, if nothing happens,",00:33:58.930,00:34:02.010
"that's probably a good thing
because there's no error",00:34:02.010,00:34:03.980
message on the screen.,00:34:03.980,00:34:05.350
"Hello, Enter.",00:34:05.350,00:34:07.190
My program has now run.,00:34:07.190,00:34:08.670
"&gt;&gt; But I can do stupid little things like
this. clang -o, hihihi, hello.c,",00:34:08.670,00:34:14.517
"enter, and now I have an identical
program named hihihi.",00:34:14.517,00:34:18.590
"It behaves the same, but
the name is different.",00:34:18.590,00:34:20.739
"&gt;&gt; So this is only to say that if you want
to influence the behavior of a",00:34:20.739,00:34:23.360
"program, we're going to increasingly
see things called",00:34:23.360,00:34:25.909
command line arguments.,00:34:25.909,00:34:27.739
This is a line.,00:34:27.739,00:34:28.639
You're typing commands.,00:34:28.639,00:34:29.580
"Ergo, command line.",00:34:29.580,00:34:30.969
"And command line arguments are just
words or little pieces of syntax that",00:34:30.969,00:34:35.690
"somehow influence the behavior of
programs that we are running.",00:34:35.690,00:34:40.840
"&gt;&gt; All right, that is perhaps the most
boring program we can write and see.",00:34:40.840,00:34:44.639
"Let's now do something
more interesting.",00:34:44.639,00:34:46.670
Let me go ahead and create a new file.,00:34:46.670,00:34:49.420
"I'm going to go ahead and save this in
John Harvard's home directory as,",00:34:49.420,00:34:53.139
"let's call it custom.c, to be
a little custom program.",00:34:53.139,00:34:58.670
"I'm going to zoom in at my top of
the tabs here and start again.",00:34:58.670,00:35:01.920
&gt;&gt; Include standard stdio.h.,00:35:01.920,00:35:03.730
More on that in a moment.,00:35:03.730,00:35:04.990
"int main(void), more on
that in a moment.",00:35:04.990,00:35:08.240
"printf (""hello, David"").",00:35:08.240,00:35:09.490
"Much more interesting, right?",00:35:12.810,00:35:14.560
"&gt;&gt; So now if-- not because of my name,
just because it's different--",00:35:14.560,00:35:20.690
make custom enter.,00:35:20.690,00:35:24.950
"Custom, hello, David.",00:35:24.950,00:35:26.780
"But even that, too, is a white lie.",00:35:26.780,00:35:28.020
"This program might as well be called
david.c, because it's not custom",00:35:28.020,00:35:30.850
behavior at all.,00:35:30.850,00:35:31.880
"Really, I want a program that asks
the user for their name.",00:35:31.880,00:35:35.080
&gt;&gt; So how do I do that?,00:35:35.080,00:35:36.320
"Well, let me scroll up over here.",00:35:36.320,00:35:38.520
"And before I use a statement in
Scratch, before I use printf,",00:35:38.520,00:35:42.960
"otherwise known as a function, let me
first ask the user for some input.",00:35:42.960,00:35:47.600
"&gt;&gt; So to do this, I need to
do a couple of things.",00:35:47.600,00:35:49.690
"One, I need a place to store the user's
name after I've asked him or",00:35:49.690,00:35:53.360
her for it.,00:35:53.360,00:35:54.510
"What construct do I need to use probably
to store a value like that?",00:35:54.510,00:36:00.120
A variable.,00:36:00.120,00:36:00.910
"&gt;&gt; So unlike Scratch, where you just get a
nice puzzle piece, here, we have to",00:36:00.910,00:36:05.130
"use, obviously, words to
express ourselves.",00:36:05.130,00:36:07.620
"And henceforth, anytime you want a
word or a phrase, in programming,",00:36:07.620,00:36:11.510
we're going to call that a string.,00:36:11.510,00:36:13.090
So a string is a word or a phrase.,00:36:13.090,00:36:14.990
"It's a sequence of zero or more
characters, more formally.",00:36:14.990,00:36:18.170
"&gt;&gt; And if you want such a variable to
exist, you have to say give me one.",00:36:18.170,00:36:22.520
"And the way by which you do that is to
say string s semicolon, where s can be",00:36:22.520,00:36:27.490
anything you want.,00:36:27.490,00:36:28.740
"In fact, s is a little underwhelming.",00:36:28.740,00:36:30.510
"Let me go ahead and more
clearly call it name.",00:36:30.510,00:36:33.250
Give me a string called name.,00:36:33.250,00:36:36.570
"&gt;&gt; But now, what is the person's
name by default?",00:36:36.570,00:36:40.180
"Well, if the human doesn't type anything
in, obviously, there's going",00:36:40.180,00:36:42.930
to be no value in name.,00:36:42.930,00:36:44.310
"And it turns out in C, if you don't give
a variable a value, it's going to",00:36:44.310,00:36:48.120
have a garbage value.,00:36:48.120,00:36:49.180
"It might have some random zeros and
ones, so you're just going to see",00:36:49.180,00:36:51.650
"garbage, truly, on the screen
if you try to display it.",00:36:51.650,00:36:54.570
"&gt;&gt; But I can fix that by saying, actually,
store inside of name the",00:36:54.570,00:36:59.800
following value.,00:36:59.800,00:37:01.400
"The way you store values in variables is
if you have a variable name on the",00:37:01.400,00:37:09.240
"left, you have to somehow put what you
want to store in it on the right, and",00:37:09.240,00:37:13.370
"the syntax for that's going
to be as follows.",00:37:13.370,00:37:17.650
"&gt;&gt; We've not seen this before, but take
on faith for a moment that there",00:37:17.650,00:37:22.120
"exists another statement in the world
that I'm going to again call function,",00:37:22.120,00:37:26.270
"and this function is
called get string.",00:37:26.270,00:37:28.310
And it does literally that.,00:37:28.310,00:37:29.670
"It somehow gets a sequence of characters
from the human and then",00:37:29.670,00:37:34.680
does something with it.,00:37:34.680,00:37:36.380
"&gt;&gt; And this does look like
cryptic syntax.",00:37:36.380,00:37:38.410
"Normally, if you're using equal signs--
you're in the world of, say,",00:37:38.410,00:37:40.880
"algebra, and you're actually
saying x equals 1.",00:37:40.880,00:37:43.740
"Here we're not saying that
name equals get string.",00:37:43.740,00:37:46.570
"We're saying store in name what's
on the right hand side",00:37:46.570,00:37:51.270
of that equals sign.,00:37:51.270,00:37:52.400
"The equals sign represents
the assignment operator.",00:37:52.400,00:37:55.030
"It's the syntax that says put what's on
the right hand side inside what's",00:37:55.030,00:37:58.240
on the left.,00:37:58.240,00:37:59.090
"So get string is a new piece of
functionality that not only does",00:37:59.090,00:38:03.040
something--,00:38:03.040,00:38:03.670
asks the user for a string--,00:38:03.670,00:38:05.000
"it also returns it, so to speak.",00:38:05.000,00:38:08.500
"&gt;&gt; So let's see what's going
to happen here.",00:38:08.500,00:38:10.690
"I'm going to go ahead now and zoom out,
and I'm going to get a couple of",00:38:10.690,00:38:14.300
mistakes at my prompt.,00:38:14.300,00:38:15.780
"I'm going to type make custom, enter.",00:38:15.780,00:38:18.750
Wow.,00:38:18.750,00:38:19.230
A whole bunch of mistakes.,00:38:19.230,00:38:20.500
"&gt;&gt; All right, so this is kind of
overwhelming, certainly at first, but",00:38:20.500,00:38:23.120
"it turns out all of these very
admittedly cryptic error messages are",00:38:23.120,00:38:27.220
"referring to some patterns that
we'll start to see over time.",00:38:27.220,00:38:30.700
"So this one I'll pluck off,
because it's first.",00:38:30.700,00:38:32.600
Use of undeclared identifier string.,00:38:32.600,00:38:35.700
"&gt;&gt; That just means that gedit, or Clang,
in this case, doesn't know",00:38:35.700,00:38:39.400
what I mean by string.,00:38:39.400,00:38:40.780
"And that's because in C, the programming
language, there actually",00:38:40.780,00:38:43.880
is no variable of type string.,00:38:43.880,00:38:47.750
C does not know that strings exist.,00:38:47.750,00:38:49.810
"&gt;&gt; But we, CS50 staff, do.",00:38:49.810,00:38:52.260
"And so in advance of class, we
created a file called CS50.h.",00:38:52.260,00:38:57.080
"And inside of this file-- and
more on the syntax to come--",00:38:57.080,00:39:00.060
"inside of this file is a definition
of what I just defined",00:39:00.060,00:39:03.730
verbally as a string.,00:39:03.730,00:39:05.340
"So simply by concluding this one line
of code in my program, I am now",00:39:05.340,00:39:09.100
"teaching gedit and make and Clang
all in turn what a string is.",00:39:09.100,00:39:14.620
&gt;&gt; I don't know how yet.,00:39:14.620,00:39:15.475
"In a few weeks, we'll peel
back that layer.",00:39:15.475,00:39:17.110
"But for now, know that this teaches
the compiler what a",00:39:17.110,00:39:20.340
string actually is.,00:39:20.340,00:39:22.020
"&gt;&gt; So now let me clear my
terminal down here.",00:39:22.020,00:39:24.230
"Let me re-run make custom, and I
solved all of those problems.",00:39:24.230,00:39:28.530
"So this, too, is going to
be a recurring theme.",00:39:28.530,00:39:30.210
"I only wrote a 9 line program, and
yet I had 18 lines of errors.",00:39:30.210,00:39:34.190
That's kind of intimidating.,00:39:34.190,00:39:35.650
"But realize that they often cascade such
that one little mistake triggers",00:39:35.650,00:39:39.260
"the confusion for the compiler, and
it looks much worse than it is.",00:39:39.260,00:39:43.070
"&gt;&gt; So now an astute observer will know
that I'm getting a string from the",00:39:43.070,00:39:47.460
"user, but I'm not actually
doing what with it?",00:39:47.460,00:39:51.460
"I'm not actually doing
anything with it.",00:39:51.460,00:39:53.570
"So if I actually run custom again,
it's going to just sit there.",00:39:53.570,00:40:01.240
What's going on?,00:40:01.240,00:40:03.380
"My program seems to be stuck on
what line, would you say?",00:40:03.380,00:40:07.990
&gt;&gt; So it's actually stuck on line 7.,00:40:07.990,00:40:09.860
"And we've not seen this before, but
on line 7, there's, again, this",00:40:09.860,00:40:13.600
"statement, get string.",00:40:13.600,00:40:14.650
And it does what it says.,00:40:14.650,00:40:15.930
"It's waiting now for the human
to take the string.",00:40:15.930,00:40:18.480
"This is completely unintuitive to me,
the human, because I haven't been told",00:40:18.480,00:40:22.230
what to do.,00:40:22.230,00:40:23.040
"&gt;&gt; But let me go ahead on faith and
let me pretend to be Rob.",00:40:23.040,00:40:27.320
Enter.,00:40:27.320,00:40:28.500
That's not the program I intended.,00:40:28.500,00:40:30.930
So we have our first blog.,00:40:30.930,00:40:32.350
"&gt;&gt; But let's try to reason through
why this is the case.",00:40:32.350,00:40:34.390
"First, let me fix this first problem.",00:40:34.390,00:40:36.940
"Let me add a line here that says
printf, what is your name?",00:40:36.940,00:40:44.690
"Let's just do close quote,
close parenthesis.",00:40:44.690,00:40:47.700
&gt;&gt; Now let me re-run the program.,00:40:47.700,00:40:51.350
Problem.,00:40:51.350,00:40:51.760
I'm not seeing that.,00:40:51.760,00:40:54.690
&gt;&gt; Right.,00:40:54.690,00:40:54.930
I didn't recompile it.,00:40:54.930,00:40:55.990
"So in a language like C, because you
change the source code does not mean",00:40:55.990,00:40:59.800
"that you have changed your object code
to generate new object code,",00:40:59.800,00:41:03.170
new zeros and ones.,00:41:03.170,00:41:04.330
You have to recompile.,00:41:04.330,00:41:05.590
"If I now re-run custom, enter,
ah, a little more clear.",00:41:05.590,00:41:10.300
My name is Rob.,00:41:10.300,00:41:11.890
Still buggy.,00:41:11.890,00:41:12.760
"&gt;&gt; And I'd argue there's
a couple bugs now.",00:41:12.760,00:41:14.170
"This just looks hideous, frankly.",00:41:14.170,00:41:15.450
"Like, minimally, I should have
a space there, or move the",00:41:15.450,00:41:18.980
cursor to the new line.,00:41:18.980,00:41:20.330
"&gt;&gt; And actually, new line.",00:41:20.330,00:41:21.370
"That's kind of a key phrase here that
we've seen but not defined.",00:41:21.370,00:41:24.660
"The way in which you get a text
to move onto the next line,",00:41:24.660,00:41:28.560
you don't do this.,00:41:28.560,00:41:29.480
This is confusing to the computer.,00:41:29.480,00:41:31.070
"This looks like two separate lines
of code, neither of which",00:41:31.070,00:41:33.830
is perfectly correct.,00:41:33.830,00:41:35.010
"You instead have to be more explicit and
say, give me a new line, which we",00:41:35.010,00:41:39.380
represent in c with backslash n.,00:41:39.380,00:41:41.810
&gt;&gt; So there's a few such characters.,00:41:41.810,00:41:43.230
Backslash n will fix that aesthetic.,00:41:43.230,00:41:45.080
Let me recompile my program.,00:41:49.640,00:41:50.870
Let me re-run my program.,00:41:50.870,00:41:52.300
&gt;&gt; This looks better.,00:41:52.300,00:41:53.520
"It's still pretty primitive,
but it's also still buggy.",00:41:53.520,00:41:56.960
So there's one--,00:41:56.960,00:41:58.090
"even if you've never programmed before,
you can probably take a guess",00:41:58.090,00:42:01.680
at why this program is still flawed.,00:42:01.680,00:42:04.960
"What do I need to do that
I haven't done yet?",00:42:04.960,00:42:08.540
"&gt;&gt; So I have to actually do
something with name.",00:42:08.540,00:42:10.450
"Just like in scratch, you might actually
assign a variable like n or",00:42:10.450,00:42:14.190
"counter like we did last
week-- a value.",00:42:14.190,00:42:16.150
"But if you don't do anything with
it, nothing's going to happen.",00:42:16.150,00:42:18.930
"&gt;&gt; All right, so let fix.",00:42:18.930,00:42:20.210
"Let me type my variable there,
and let me go down here.",00:42:20.210,00:42:23.670
"Let me recompile, let me re-run, Rob.",00:42:23.670,00:42:29.120
"Now I'm just an idiot, right?",00:42:29.120,00:42:30.540
"&gt;&gt; So this is not really getting
me any further.",00:42:30.540,00:42:33.280
"But that was a perfectly natural
instinct, I'd argue, right?",00:42:33.280,00:42:35.850
"If the variable is called name, and I
want it to go there, why don't I just",00:42:35.850,00:42:39.340
type it there?,00:42:39.340,00:42:40.200
"&gt;&gt; Well, of course, we have
to distinguish now",00:42:40.200,00:42:42.210
between what is a string?,00:42:42.210,00:42:44.070
"Notice that quote unquote
here, hello name?",00:42:44.070,00:42:47.060
This actually itself is a string.,00:42:47.060,00:42:48.960
It's hard coded.,00:42:48.960,00:42:49.820
It's not from the human.,00:42:49.820,00:42:50.690
"It's from me, the original programmer,
but it's still a string.",00:42:50.690,00:42:54.020
"&gt;&gt; So if you literally write N-A-M-E inside
of a string, what's going to",00:42:54.020,00:42:58.300
get printed?,00:42:58.300,00:42:59.120
"Well, N-A-M-E. We instead need
to tell printf, don't print",00:42:59.120,00:43:03.660
out literally name.,00:43:03.660,00:43:04.870
Print out the value of name.,00:43:04.870,00:43:06.680
"&gt;&gt; And to do that, we do the following.",00:43:06.680,00:43:08.410
And this is just a human convention.,00:43:08.410,00:43:09.800
"We instead say %s, and that
stands for string.",00:43:09.800,00:43:14.990
"And then at the end of my close quotes,
I'm going to put a comma and",00:43:14.990,00:43:19.810
"pass a second argument
into this statement.",00:43:19.810,00:43:23.790
I'm going to type name there.,00:43:23.790,00:43:25.970
"&gt;&gt; So now notice we have a
slightly new syntax.",00:43:25.970,00:43:27.960
"We still have two parentheses, and
henceforth let me say that the stuff",00:43:27.960,00:43:32.320
"between parentheses represents
arguments into a function--",00:43:32.320,00:43:36.830
"inputs that are somehow going
to influence its behavior.",00:43:36.830,00:43:39.730
"So by that logic, how many arguments
does printf seem to be",00:43:39.730,00:43:43.010
taking at this moment?,00:43:43.010,00:43:45.450
"&gt;&gt; So it seems to be taking two,
and that's indeed implied",00:43:45.450,00:43:48.370
by the comma here.,00:43:48.370,00:43:49.570
"So this is one argument
in between quotes.",00:43:49.570,00:43:51.640
"Even though it has a comma in it,
everything's in quotes, which means",00:43:51.640,00:43:54.540
it's one long string.,00:43:54.540,00:43:56.230
"Comma, variable name.",00:43:56.230,00:43:58.280
&gt;&gt; So now let me zoom out.,00:43:58.280,00:44:00.680
Let me re-run it.,00:44:00.680,00:44:02.240
Rob.,00:44:02.240,00:44:03.490
"Damn it, what did I do wrong?",00:44:03.490,00:44:06.520
"&gt;&gt; All right, so you have to recompile.",00:44:06.520,00:44:07.920
"So again, easy mistakes to make
early on again and again.",00:44:07.920,00:44:11.030
"So now re-run custom, Rob,
enter, and voila.",00:44:11.030,00:44:15.280
We now have a custom program.,00:44:15.280,00:44:17.110
"&gt;&gt; So I now have a program that
using a few characteristics",00:44:17.110,00:44:21.660
that are worth noting.,00:44:21.660,00:44:22.520
"One, I'm using CS50.h, otherwise
known as the CS50 library.",00:44:22.520,00:44:27.850
"And inside of the CS50 library are
functions that other people wrote--",00:44:27.850,00:44:33.050
namely the staff--,00:44:33.050,00:44:33.980
"for you to use, and get
string is one of them.",00:44:33.980,00:44:36.620
"&gt;&gt; Inside of line 2 is stdio.h,
and why is this there?",00:44:36.620,00:44:41.310
Take a guess.,00:44:41.310,00:44:42.070
"What exists inside of
standard IO parent?",00:44:42.070,00:44:46.200
Printf.,00:44:46.200,00:44:46.940
"So printf, you don't see it anywhere
else on the screen.",00:44:46.940,00:44:49.600
"It must come with the
computer somehow.",00:44:49.600,00:44:51.870
Where does it come from?,00:44:51.870,00:44:54.870
"It's inside of-- it's declared,
so to speak, inside of",00:44:54.870,00:44:57.660
a file called stdio.h.,00:44:57.660,00:44:59.890
"&gt;&gt; Now, for this stuff, we'll come back
to eventually, because it's a bit",00:44:59.890,00:45:02.670
distracting for now.,00:45:02.670,00:45:03.930
This refers to our return type.,00:45:03.930,00:45:05.490
This refers to an argument.,00:45:05.490,00:45:07.660
"But for today, we're focused
just here on these lines.",00:45:07.660,00:45:10.230
"&gt;&gt; So string name, just to recap,
what did this do for me?",00:45:10.230,00:45:13.280
"So it declared a variable
of type string.",00:45:16.940,00:45:19.560
"So it's meant to be for words,
not for numbers.",00:45:19.560,00:45:22.630
"Just as an aside, if I did want
it to be a number, I would say",00:45:22.630,00:45:25.530
something like int.,00:45:25.530,00:45:26.560
"If I wanted to be a floating point
value, something with a decimal point,",00:45:26.560,00:45:29.740
I would say float.,00:45:29.740,00:45:30.600
"But for today, I've just said string.",00:45:30.600,00:45:32.640
"&gt;&gt; And I've given this variable
a name of name, but I could",00:45:32.640,00:45:35.940
have called it anything.,00:45:35.940,00:45:37.240
"In fact, originally, I called it S.",00:45:37.240,00:45:39.340
&gt;&gt; This here is just another statement.,00:45:39.340,00:45:41.050
"How many arguments is this
statement taking?",00:45:41.050,00:45:44.170
"So it's just taking one, and that
is simply an aesthetic detail of",00:45:44.170,00:45:47.890
"displaying something on
the screen to me.",00:45:47.890,00:45:49.610
"What is this line 8 doing
in layman's terms?",00:45:49.610,00:45:54.750
"&gt;&gt; It's getting a value from the
user-- namely, a string--",00:45:54.750,00:45:57.320
and what's it doing with it?,00:45:57.320,00:45:58.770
"It's essentially handing it over to the
guy on the left hand side of the",00:45:58.770,00:46:02.450
"equals sign so that in this case, the
name variable can actually store it.",00:46:02.450,00:46:07.100
"&gt;&gt; And then printf is another
instance of a function.",00:46:07.100,00:46:10.020
And we say to call a function.,00:46:10.020,00:46:11.870
"To use a function is
to call a function.",00:46:11.870,00:46:13.870
"This thing apparently
takes two arguments.",00:46:13.870,00:46:15.640
"This one, comma, this one.",00:46:15.640,00:46:18.100
"&gt;&gt; This one itself is just a string
that contains a placeholder.",00:46:18.100,00:46:20.910
%s means put another string here.,00:46:20.910,00:46:23.860
"And so by putting name after
the comma, that's inserting",00:46:23.860,00:46:27.360
that thing for me.,00:46:27.360,00:46:29.420
&gt;&gt; So I can do other things still.,00:46:29.420,00:46:31.300
"Let me go ahead now and do a bit of a
silly program, but let me delete this,",00:46:31.300,00:46:36.820
and let me create a loop.,00:46:36.820,00:46:38.880
While true.,00:46:38.880,00:46:41.390
"The symbol true is obviously
always going to be true.",00:46:41.390,00:46:45.210
"So what kind of loop am I inducing
by writing a line like this?",00:46:45.210,00:46:49.830
"&gt;&gt; So an infinite loop, right?",00:46:49.830,00:46:51.070
Just while true.,00:46:51.070,00:46:52.090
"There's no way I can change the word
true to be anything else, so this is",00:46:52.090,00:46:56.210
just going to run forever.,00:46:56.210,00:46:57.310
"So if you've ever actually had a program
in your Mac or PC that seems",00:46:57.310,00:46:59.960
"to have locked up, or it's doing
something and something, and you just",00:46:59.960,00:47:02.480
"can't get the thing to quit unless you
reboot your computer or pull up the",00:47:02.480,00:47:05.500
"Task Manager or the like,
here's such an example.",00:47:05.500,00:47:08.360
"&gt;&gt; I can say, ""I am a buggy program.""
Close quote, close",00:47:08.360,00:47:14.340
"parenthesis, semicolon.",00:47:14.340,00:47:15.780
"So again, notice the patterns.",00:47:15.780,00:47:17.010
"Even though some of our syntax is new,
the keyword while, the keyword true,",00:47:17.010,00:47:21.440
"notice I have the same
kind of curly braces.",00:47:21.440,00:47:23.590
I've got a semicolon and parentheses.,00:47:23.590,00:47:25.890
"&gt;&gt; So now let's go ahead
and compile this.",00:47:25.890,00:47:28.000
"Make custom, custom.",00:47:28.000,00:47:29.630
"So at this point, you do not need to
restart your appliance, all right?",00:47:32.690,00:47:36.660
"So the easy lesson here is with
two fingers, Control C,",00:47:36.660,00:47:39.925
we'll quit that program.,00:47:39.925,00:47:41.230
"But you can see exactly why this thing
was repeating itself again and again.",00:47:41.230,00:47:45.430
"&gt;&gt; I can do something a little
more complex as a teaser.",00:47:45.430,00:47:48.080
"I'm going to go ahead and
say the following.",00:47:48.080,00:47:49.600
"For int, which is an integer, i is just
a generic name we give to most",00:47:49.600,00:47:55.210
"variables in programming when you're
just counting, equals 0.",00:47:55.210,00:47:59.500
"Let me go ahead and say while i is,
let's say, less than 100, i plus plus.",00:47:59.500,00:48:08.640
"We'll back to this syntax,
but this just means",00:48:08.640,00:48:10.240
increment i again and again.,00:48:10.240,00:48:12.270
&gt;&gt; And what do I want to do here?,00:48:12.270,00:48:14.200
"Printf, ""I can count to i.""
This is a buggy program.",00:48:14.200,00:48:21.130
What did I actually intend here?,00:48:21.130,00:48:22.450
"&gt;&gt; Percent not s, but you wouldn't guess
this. %d is a decimal integer.",00:48:25.220,00:48:30.940
Comma i.,00:48:30.940,00:48:32.720
Let me roll back.,00:48:32.720,00:48:34.340
&gt;&gt; Let me now recompile with make.,00:48:34.340,00:48:37.170
Let me now rerun with custom.,00:48:37.170,00:48:39.280
"I can count really damn fast when
I write a program like this.",00:48:39.280,00:48:42.410
"&gt;&gt; Now let's do something a
little unintentional.",00:48:42.410,00:48:45.480
"How about let's do this while i
is greater than or equal to 0.",00:48:45.480,00:48:51.220
What's this going to induce?,00:48:51.220,00:48:53.630
"So logically, this is not so wise,
because now if I rerun this, recount,",00:48:53.630,00:49:01.030
"I can now count really, really high.",00:49:01.030,00:49:05.050
"Unfortunately, about as high as I can
count is 4 billion, so this is going",00:49:05.050,00:49:08.850
to take a while.,00:49:08.850,00:49:10.140
"&gt;&gt; So why don't we leave this as our
cliffhanger, promising that on",00:49:10.140,00:49:13.440
"Wednesday, we'll see if
this program is done.",00:49:13.440,00:49:15.650
"Two, we'll introduce how you yourself
write your own function so that very",00:49:15.650,00:49:19.260
"quickly, by Wednesday, we'll, as we
transition from Scratch into C, start",00:49:19.260,00:49:22.930
"writing ever increasingly complex
programs that do much,",00:49:22.930,00:49:25.880
much more than this.,00:49:25.880,00:49:27.070
We will see you then.,00:49:27.070,00:49:28.766
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE],00:49:28.766,00:49:31.580
"&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: At the next CS50,
Puzzle Day was a success.",00:49:31.580,00:49:34.690
