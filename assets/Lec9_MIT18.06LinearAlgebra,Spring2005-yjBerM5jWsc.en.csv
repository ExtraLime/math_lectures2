"OK, this is linear
algebra lecture nine.",00:00:09.840,00:00:14.610
"And this is a key lecture, this
is where we get these ideas",00:00:14.610,00:00:21.130
"of linear independence,
when a bunch of vectors are",00:00:21.130,00:00:27.480
independent --,00:00:27.480,00:00:29.600
"or dependent,
that's the opposite.",00:00:29.600,00:00:33.890
The space they span.,00:00:33.890,00:00:36.680
"A basis for a subspace
or a basis for a vector",00:00:36.680,00:00:40.550
"space, that's a central idea.",00:00:40.550,00:00:42.730
"And then the dimension
of that subspace.",00:00:42.730,00:00:47.060
"So this is the day
that those words",00:00:47.060,00:00:50.240
get assigned clear meanings.,00:00:50.240,00:00:52.960
"And emphasize that we talk
about a bunch of vectors",00:00:52.960,00:00:58.380
being independent.,00:00:58.380,00:00:59.550
"Wouldn't talk about a
matrix being independent.",00:00:59.550,00:01:02.780
"A bunch of vectors
being independent.",00:01:02.780,00:01:05.150
"A bunch of vectors
spanning a space.",00:01:05.150,00:01:07.840
"A bunch of vectors
being a basis.",00:01:07.840,00:01:11.480
"And the dimension
is some number.",00:01:11.480,00:01:15.070
"OK, so what are the definitions?",00:01:15.070,00:01:17.480
"Can I begin with a fact,
a highly important fact,",00:01:17.480,00:01:21.840
"that, I didn't call directly
attention to earlier.",00:01:21.840,00:01:28.240
"Suppose I have a matrix and
I look at Ax equals zero.",00:01:28.240,00:01:35.900
"Suppose the matrix
has a lot of columns,",00:01:35.900,00:01:39.530
so that n is bigger than m.,00:01:39.530,00:01:43.340
So I'm looking at n equations --,00:01:43.340,00:01:46.320
"I mean, sorry, m
equations, a small number",00:01:46.320,00:01:48.920
"of equations m,
and more unknowns.",00:01:48.920,00:01:52.650
"I have more unknowns
than equations.",00:01:52.650,00:01:55.960
Let me write that down.,00:01:55.960,00:01:57.040
More unknowns than equations.,00:01:57.040,00:01:59.850
More unknown x-s than equations.,00:01:59.850,00:02:03.170
"Then the conclusion
is that there's",00:02:03.170,00:02:15.440
"something in the null
space of A, other",00:02:15.440,00:02:19.330
than just the zero vector.,00:02:19.330,00:02:21.350
"The conclusion is there
are some non-zero x-s",00:02:21.350,00:02:26.320
such that Ax is zero.,00:02:26.320,00:02:28.220
"There are some
special solutions.",00:02:28.220,00:02:30.030
And why?,00:02:30.030,00:02:31.060
We know why.,00:02:31.060,00:02:33.590
"I mean, it sort of like seems
like a reasonable thing, more",00:02:33.590,00:02:38.120
"unknowns than equations,
then it seems reasonable",00:02:38.120,00:02:42.150
that we can solve them.,00:02:42.150,00:02:43.540
"But we have a, a clear algorithm
which starts with a system",00:02:43.540,00:02:49.210
"and does elimination, gets
the thing into an echelon",00:02:49.210,00:02:55.440
"form with some pivots
and pivot columns,",00:02:55.440,00:03:01.630
"and possibly some free columns
that don't have pivots.",00:03:01.630,00:03:06.050
"And the point is here there
will be some free columns.",00:03:06.050,00:03:09.290
"The reason, so the
reason is there must --",00:03:09.290,00:03:14.940
"there will be free
variables, at least one.",00:03:14.940,00:03:20.080
That's the reason.,00:03:25.010,00:03:27.580
That we now have this --,00:03:27.580,00:03:30.130
"a complete, algorithm, a
complete systematic way to say,",00:03:30.130,00:03:36.200
"OK, we take the
system Ax equals zero,",00:03:36.200,00:03:38.860
"we row reduce, we identify
the free variables,",00:03:38.860,00:03:42.370
"and, since there are n
variables and at most m pivots,",00:03:42.370,00:03:48.690
"there will be some free
variables, at least one,",00:03:48.690,00:03:51.840
"at least n-m in fact, left over.",00:03:51.840,00:03:55.090
"And those variables I can
assign non-zero values to.",00:03:55.090,00:04:00.480
"I don't have to
set those to zero.",00:04:00.480,00:04:02.110
"I can take them to be
one or whatever I like,",00:04:02.110,00:04:04.580
"and then I can solve
for the pivot variables.",00:04:04.580,00:04:07.970
"So then it gives me a
solution to Ax equals zero.",00:04:07.970,00:04:11.870
"And it's a solution
that isn't all zeros.",00:04:11.870,00:04:15.820
"So, that's an important
point that we'll",00:04:15.820,00:04:21.769
use now in this lecture.,00:04:21.769,00:04:26.350
"So now I want to say what does
it mean for a bunch of vectors",00:04:26.350,00:04:30.110
to be independent.,00:04:30.110,00:04:31.470
OK.,00:04:31.470,00:04:32.370
"So this is like the
background that we know.",00:04:32.370,00:04:36.276
"Now I want to speak
about independence.",00:04:36.276,00:04:37.900
OK.,00:04:41.500,00:04:42.000
Let's see.,00:04:46.110,00:04:48.740
"I can give you the abstract
definition, and I will,",00:04:48.740,00:04:55.430
"but I would also like to
give you the direct meaning.",00:04:55.430,00:05:00.325
"So the question is, when
vectors x1, x2 up to --",00:05:03.700,00:05:12.700
"Suppose I have n vectors
are independent if.",00:05:12.700,00:05:19.860
Now I have to give you --,00:05:19.860,00:05:22.350
or linearly independent --,00:05:22.350,00:05:25.560
"I'll often just say and
write independent for short.",00:05:25.560,00:05:30.470
OK.,00:05:30.470,00:05:31.300
"I'll give you the
full definition.",00:05:31.300,00:05:33.580
"These are just vectors
in some vector space.",00:05:33.580,00:05:36.920
I can take combinations of them.,00:05:36.920,00:05:39.360
"The question is, do any
combinations give zero?",00:05:39.360,00:05:45.070
"If some combination
of those vectors",00:05:45.070,00:05:47.210
"gives the zero vector,
other than the combination",00:05:47.210,00:05:51.030
"of all zeros, then
they're dependent.",00:05:51.030,00:05:55.520
"They're independent if no
combination gives the zero",00:05:55.520,00:06:06.100
vector --,00:06:06.100,00:06:08.550
"and then I have, I'll have
to put in an except the zero",00:06:08.550,00:06:17.070
combination.,00:06:17.070,00:06:18.840
So what do I mean by that?,00:06:18.840,00:06:21.160
"No combination gives
the zero vector.",00:06:21.160,00:06:23.720
"Any combination
c1 x1+c2 x2 plus,",00:06:23.720,00:06:29.950
"plus cn xn is not zero except
for the zero combination.",00:06:29.950,00:06:39.260
"This is when all the c-s,
all the c-s are zero.",00:06:39.260,00:06:45.610
Then of course.,00:06:45.610,00:06:46.315
"That combination --
I know I'll get zero.",00:06:49.290,00:06:52.100
"But the question is, does any
other combination give zero?",00:06:52.100,00:06:55.950
"If not, then the
vectors are independent.",00:06:55.950,00:06:59.970
"If some other combination
does give zero,",00:06:59.970,00:07:02.630
the vectors are dependent.,00:07:02.630,00:07:04.880
OK.,00:07:04.880,00:07:05.510
Let's just take examples.,00:07:05.510,00:07:08.420
"Suppose I'm in, say, in
two dimensional space.",00:07:08.420,00:07:14.510
OK.,00:07:14.510,00:07:15.590
I give you --,00:07:15.590,00:07:16.940
"I'd like to first
take an example --",00:07:16.940,00:07:19.900
"let me take an example where
I have a vector and twice that",00:07:19.900,00:07:24.480
vector.,00:07:24.480,00:07:26.290
"So that's two vectors, V and 2V.",00:07:26.290,00:07:29.720
"Are those dependent
or independent?",00:07:29.720,00:07:33.830
"Those are dependent
for sure, right,",00:07:33.830,00:07:35.820
"because there's one
vector is twice the other.",00:07:35.820,00:07:40.380
"One vector is twice
as long as the other,",00:07:40.380,00:07:42.250
"so if the word dependent
means anything,",00:07:42.250,00:07:44.780
these should be dependent.,00:07:44.780,00:07:46.670
And they are.,00:07:46.670,00:07:47.910
"And in fact, I would
take two of the first --",00:07:47.910,00:07:51.860
"so here's, here is a vector V
and the other guy is a vector",00:07:51.860,00:07:56.750
"2V, that's my --",00:07:56.750,00:07:59.350
"so there's a vector V1 and
my next vector V2 is 2V1.",00:07:59.350,00:08:04.730
"Of course those are
dependent, because two",00:08:04.730,00:08:08.630
"of these first vectors minus
the second vector is zero.",00:08:08.630,00:08:14.120
"That's a combination of these
two vectors that gives the zero",00:08:14.120,00:08:17.620
vector.,00:08:17.620,00:08:18.120
"OK, that was clear.",00:08:18.120,00:08:20.060
"Suppose, suppose
I have a vector --",00:08:20.060,00:08:24.430
here's another,00:08:24.430,00:08:25.060
example.,00:08:25.060,00:08:25.800
It's easy example.,00:08:25.800,00:08:26.950
"Suppose I have a vector and the
other guy is the zero vector.",00:08:26.950,00:08:31.010
"Suppose I have a vector V1
and V2 is the zero vector.",00:08:31.010,00:08:36.820
"Then are those vectors
dependent or independent?",00:08:36.820,00:08:43.309
They're dependent again.,00:08:43.309,00:08:46.230
"You could say, well, this
guy is zero times that one.",00:08:46.230,00:08:50.480
"This one is some
combination of those.",00:08:50.480,00:08:52.970
"But let me write
it the other way.",00:08:52.970,00:08:54.900
"Let me say -- what combination,
how many V1s and how many V2s",00:08:54.900,00:09:01.110
shall I take to get the zero,00:09:01.110,00:09:02.671
vector?,00:09:02.671,00:09:03.170
"If, if V1 is like the vector two
one and V2 is the zero vector,",00:09:05.810,00:09:11.490
"zero zero, then I
would like to show",00:09:11.490,00:09:15.740
"that some combination of
those gives the zero vector.",00:09:15.740,00:09:18.640
What shall I take?,00:09:18.640,00:09:19.820
How many V1s shall I take?,00:09:19.820,00:09:22.660
Zero of them.,00:09:22.660,00:09:23.540
"Yeah, no, take no V1s.",00:09:23.540,00:09:25.310
But how many V2s?,00:09:25.310,00:09:28.290
Six.,00:09:28.290,00:09:28.970
OK.,00:09:28.970,00:09:31.700
Or five.,00:09:31.700,00:09:34.790
"Then -- in other words,
the point is if the zero",00:09:34.790,00:09:38.590
"vector's in there,
if the zero --",00:09:38.590,00:09:41.340
"if one of these vectors
is the zero vector,",00:09:41.340,00:09:44.760
"independence is dead, right?",00:09:44.760,00:09:47.490
"If one of those vectors is the
zero vector then I could always",00:09:47.490,00:09:50.440
take --,00:09:50.440,00:09:51.970
"include that one and
none of the others,",00:09:51.970,00:09:54.120
"and I would get the zero answer,
and I would show dependence.",00:09:54.120,00:09:59.370
OK.,00:09:59.370,00:10:00.230
"Now, let me, let me
finally draw an example",00:10:00.230,00:10:04.890
where they will be independent.,00:10:04.890,00:10:06.860
Suppose that's V1 and that's V2.,00:10:06.860,00:10:10.900
"Those are surely
independent, right?",00:10:10.900,00:10:14.820
"Any combination of
V1 and V2, will not",00:10:14.820,00:10:19.400
"be zero except, the
zero combination.",00:10:19.400,00:10:22.780
So those would be independent.,00:10:22.780,00:10:24.390
"But now let me, let me
stick in a third vector, V3.",00:10:24.390,00:10:28.040
"Independent or dependent
now, those three vectors?",00:10:31.100,00:10:34.200
So now n is three here.,00:10:34.200,00:10:37.390
"I'm in two dimensional space,
whatever, I'm in the plane.",00:10:37.390,00:10:42.150
"I have three vectors that
I didn't draw so carefully.",00:10:42.150,00:10:47.390
"I didn't even tell you
what exactly they were.",00:10:47.390,00:10:50.520
"But what's this answer on
dependent or independent?",00:10:50.520,00:10:55.820
Dependent.,00:10:55.820,00:10:57.200
"How do I know those
are dependent?",00:10:57.200,00:11:00.570
"How do I know that some
combination of V1, V2, and V3",00:11:00.570,00:11:05.570
gives me the zero vector?,00:11:05.570,00:11:09.010
I know because of that.,00:11:09.010,00:11:12.130
"That's the key
fact that tells me",00:11:12.130,00:11:20.160
"that three vectors in the
plane have to be dependent.",00:11:20.160,00:11:23.990
Why's that?,00:11:23.990,00:11:25.120
"What's the connection between
the dependence of these three",00:11:25.120,00:11:28.650
vectors and that fact?,00:11:28.650,00:11:30.620
OK.,00:11:30.620,00:11:31.140
So here's the connection.,00:11:31.140,00:11:33.350
"I take the matrix A that has
V1 in its first column, V2",00:11:33.350,00:11:42.260
"in its second column,
V3 in its third column.",00:11:42.260,00:11:46.560
So it's got three columns.,00:11:46.560,00:11:48.560
And V1 --,00:11:48.560,00:11:49.600
"I don't know, that
looks like about two one",00:11:49.600,00:11:51.950
to me.,00:11:51.950,00:11:52.880
"V2 looks like it
might be one two.",00:11:52.880,00:11:56.430
"V3 looks like it might be maybe
two, maybe two and a half,",00:11:56.430,00:12:01.990
minus one.,00:12:01.990,00:12:03.570
OK.,00:12:07.520,00:12:08.230
"Those are my three vectors, and
I put them in the columns of A.",00:12:08.230,00:12:13.900
"Now that matrix A
is two by three.",00:12:13.900,00:12:18.530
"It fits this pattern, that
where we know we've got extra",00:12:18.530,00:12:22.960
"variables, we know we
have some free variables,",00:12:22.960,00:12:25.900
"we know that there's
some combination --",00:12:25.900,00:12:28.640
"and let me instead of x-s, let
me call them c1, c2, and c3 --",00:12:28.640,00:12:34.650
that gives the zero vector.,00:12:34.650,00:12:39.380
"Sorry that my little bit
of art got in the way.",00:12:39.380,00:12:41.830
Do you see the point?,00:12:41.830,00:12:44.470
"When I have a matrix,
I'm interested",00:12:44.470,00:12:48.600
"in whether its columns are
dependent or independent.",00:12:48.600,00:12:53.710
"The columns are
dependent if there",00:12:53.710,00:12:56.470
is something in the null space.,00:12:56.470,00:12:58.480
"The columns are
dependent because this,",00:12:58.480,00:13:00.860
"this thing in the
null space says",00:13:00.860,00:13:03.090
"that c1 of that plus c2 of
that plus c3 of this is zero.",00:13:03.090,00:13:09.190
"So in other words, I can go
out some V1, out some more V2,",00:13:09.190,00:13:13.670
"back on V3, and end up zero.",00:13:13.670,00:13:16.260
OK.,00:13:19.010,00:13:19.850
"So let -- here I've give the
general, abstract definition,",00:13:19.850,00:13:25.290
"but let me repeat
that definition --",00:13:25.290,00:13:28.360
this is like repeat --,00:13:28.360,00:13:31.840
let me call them Vs now.,00:13:31.840,00:13:39.270
"V1 up to Vn are the
columns of a matrix A.",00:13:39.270,00:13:47.450
"In other words,
this is telling me",00:13:47.450,00:13:50.120
"that if I'm in m
dimensional space,",00:13:50.120,00:13:57.510
"like two dimensional
space in the example,",00:13:57.510,00:14:00.630
"I can answer the
dependence-independence",00:14:00.630,00:14:03.940
"question directly by
putting those vectors",00:14:03.940,00:14:10.180
in the columns of a matrix.,00:14:10.180,00:14:11.580
"They are independent if the
null space of A, of A, is what?",00:14:14.330,00:14:30.380
"If I have a bunch of
columns in a matrix,",00:14:33.230,00:14:36.370
"I'm looking at
their combinations,",00:14:36.370,00:14:38.870
"but that's just A times
the vector of c-s.",00:14:38.870,00:14:44.850
"And these columns
will be independent",00:14:44.850,00:14:48.020
"if the null space of
A is the zero vector.",00:14:48.020,00:14:56.390
"They are dependent if there's
something else in there.",00:15:01.270,00:15:11.960
"If there's something else in
the null space, if A times c",00:15:11.960,00:15:17.380
"gives the zero vector
for some non-zero vector",00:15:17.380,00:15:25.240
c in the null space.,00:15:25.240,00:15:26.575
"Then they're dependent,
because that's",00:15:29.160,00:15:30.770
"telling me a combination of the
columns gives the zero column.",00:15:30.770,00:15:34.380
"I think you're with
be, because we've seen,",00:15:34.380,00:15:38.040
"like, lecture after
lecture, we're",00:15:38.040,00:15:40.340
"looking at the combinations
of the columns and asking,",00:15:40.340,00:15:43.500
do we get zero or don't we?,00:15:43.500,00:15:45.550
"And now we're giving
the official name,",00:15:45.550,00:15:49.030
"dependent if we do,
independent if we don't.",00:15:49.030,00:15:54.010
"So I could express this
in other words now.",00:15:54.010,00:15:57.890
"I could say the rank -- what's
the rank in this independent",00:15:57.890,00:16:01.420
case?,00:16:01.420,00:16:02.450
"The rank r of the,
of the matrix,",00:16:02.450,00:16:05.020
"in the case of
independent columns, is?",00:16:05.020,00:16:08.235
So the columns are independent.,00:16:11.570,00:16:14.740
"So how many pivot
columns have I got.",00:16:14.740,00:16:18.560
All n.,00:16:18.560,00:16:19.850
"All the columns would
be pivot columns,",00:16:19.850,00:16:23.310
"because free columns
are telling me",00:16:23.310,00:16:25.980
"that they're a combination
of earlier columns.",00:16:25.980,00:16:29.820
"So this would be the
case where the rank is n.",00:16:29.820,00:16:33.080
"This would be the case where
the rank is smaller than n.",00:16:33.080,00:16:36.910
"So in this case the rank is
n and the null space of A",00:16:39.650,00:16:44.770
is only the zero vector.,00:16:44.770,00:16:48.750
And no free variables.,00:16:48.750,00:16:50.800
No free variables.,00:16:50.800,00:16:52.400
"And this is the case
yes free variables.",00:16:56.520,00:16:58.975
"If you'll allow me to stretch
the English language that far.",00:17:04.300,00:17:09.589
"That's the case where
we have, a combination",00:17:09.589,00:17:16.290
that gives the zero column.,00:17:16.290,00:17:19.040
"I'm often interested in the
case when my vectors are",00:17:19.040,00:17:23.089
popped into a matrix.,00:17:23.089,00:17:25.560
"So the, the definition
over there of independence",00:17:25.560,00:17:28.349
didn't talk about any matrix.,00:17:28.349,00:17:31.270
"The vectors didn't have to be
vectors in N dimensional space.",00:17:31.270,00:17:36.130
"And I want to give
you some examples",00:17:36.130,00:17:38.530
"of vectors that
aren't what you think",00:17:38.530,00:17:41.710
of immediately as vectors.,00:17:41.710,00:17:43.970
"But most of the time, this is
-- the vectors we think of are",00:17:43.970,00:17:49.420
columns.,00:17:49.420,00:17:51.200
And we can put them in a matrix.,00:17:51.200,00:17:54.570
"And then independence
or dependence",00:17:54.570,00:17:57.330
comes back to the null space.,00:17:57.330,00:18:01.650
OK.,00:18:01.650,00:18:02.162
"So that's the idea
of independence.",00:18:02.162,00:18:03.620
"Can I just, yeah, let
me go on to spanning a",00:18:06.410,00:18:13.770
"What does it mean for a bunch
of vectors to span a space?",00:18:13.770,00:18:19.480
space.,00:18:19.480,00:18:20.580
"Well, actually, we've
seen it already.",00:18:20.580,00:18:23.800
"You remember, if we had
a columns in a matrix,",00:18:23.800,00:18:28.040
"we took all their
combinations and that gave us",00:18:28.040,00:18:33.130
the column space.,00:18:33.130,00:18:36.640
"Those vectors that we started
with span that column space.",00:18:36.640,00:18:41.250
So spanning a space means --,00:18:41.250,00:18:44.490
"so let me move that
important stuff right up.",00:18:44.490,00:18:48.440
OK.,00:18:53.130,00:18:54.050
"So vectors -- let me call
them, say, V1 up to --",00:18:54.050,00:19:02.400
"call you some different
letter, say Vl --",00:19:02.400,00:19:06.360
"span a space, a subspace,
or just a vector space",00:19:06.360,00:19:15.680
"I could say, span a
space means, means",00:19:15.680,00:19:24.790
"the space consists of all
combinations of those vectors.",00:19:24.790,00:19:40.270
"That's exactly what we
did with the column space.",00:19:46.464,00:19:48.505
"So now I could say in shorthand
the columns of a matrix",00:19:51.040,00:19:54.740
span the column space.,00:19:54.740,00:19:57.090
"So you remember it's a bunch of
vectors that have this property",00:19:57.090,00:20:00.750
"that they span a space, and
actually if I give you a bunch",00:20:00.750,00:20:05.450
of vectors and say --,00:20:05.450,00:20:06.480
"OK, let S be the
space that they span,",00:20:06.480,00:20:10.720
"in other words let S contain
all their combinations,",00:20:10.720,00:20:14.870
"that space S will
be the smallest",00:20:14.870,00:20:17.750
"space with those
vectors in it, right?",00:20:17.750,00:20:21.830
"Because any space with
those vectors in it",00:20:21.830,00:20:24.300
"must have all the combinations
of those vectors in it.",00:20:24.300,00:20:28.730
"And if I stop there, then
I've got the smallest space,",00:20:28.730,00:20:34.540
"and that's the space
that they span.",00:20:34.540,00:20:37.300
OK.,00:20:37.300,00:20:37.800
So I'm just --,00:20:37.800,00:20:39.150
"rather than, needing to say,
take all linear combinations",00:20:39.150,00:20:44.150
"and put them in a space,
I'm compressing that",00:20:44.150,00:20:48.950
into the word span.,00:20:48.950,00:20:50.740
Straightforward.,00:20:53.169,00:20:53.835
"So if I think of a, of
the column space of a",00:20:57.520,00:21:00.015
OK. matrix.,00:21:00.015,00:21:00.515
"I've got their -- so I
start with the columns.",00:21:03.890,00:21:07.380
I take all their combinations.,00:21:07.380,00:21:08.930
That gives me the columns space.,00:21:08.930,00:21:10.760
They span the column space.,00:21:10.760,00:21:13.440
Now are they independent?,00:21:13.440,00:21:16.230
"Maybe yes, maybe no.",00:21:16.230,00:21:19.620
"It depends on the particular
columns that went into that",00:21:19.620,00:21:23.060
matrix.,00:21:23.060,00:21:24.470
"But obviously I'm highly
interested in a set",00:21:24.470,00:21:29.700
"of vectors that spans a
space and is independent.",00:21:29.700,00:21:36.870
"That's, that means like I've
got the right number of vectors.",00:21:36.870,00:21:41.630
"If I didn't have all of them,
I wouldn't have my whole space.",00:21:41.630,00:21:47.580
"If I had more than that,
they probably wouldn't --",00:21:47.580,00:21:50.290
they wouldn't be independent.,00:21:50.290,00:21:52.450
"So, like, basis -- and that's
the word that's coming --",00:21:52.450,00:21:56.860
is just right.,00:21:56.860,00:21:58.600
"So here let me put
what that word means.",00:21:58.600,00:22:01.310
"A basis for a vector space is,
is a, is a sequence of vectors",00:22:01.310,00:22:14.270
--,00:22:14.270,00:22:14.770
"shall I call them V1, V2,
up to let me say Vd now,",00:22:20.050,00:22:27.040
"I'll stop with that letters
-- that has two properties.",00:22:27.040,00:22:33.600
"I've got enough vectors
and not too many.",00:22:33.600,00:22:36.230
It's a natural idea of a basis.,00:22:36.230,00:22:39.340
"So a basis is a bunch
of vectors in the space",00:22:39.340,00:22:42.570
"and it's a so it's a sequence
of vectors with two properties,",00:22:42.570,00:22:47.200
with two properties.,00:22:47.200,00:22:50.050
"One, they are independent.",00:22:54.760,00:22:57.675
"And two -- you
know what's coming?",00:23:05.020,00:23:07.990
-- they span the space.,00:23:07.990,00:23:10.040
OK.,00:23:20.560,00:23:21.880
Let me take --,00:23:21.880,00:23:25.050
"so time for examples, of course.",00:23:25.050,00:23:28.510
"So I'm asking you now
to put definition one,",00:23:28.510,00:23:32.320
"the definition of independence,
together with definition two,",00:23:32.320,00:23:38.030
"and let's look at examples,
because this is --",00:23:38.030,00:23:41.800
"this combination
means the set I've --",00:23:41.800,00:23:44.840
"of vectors I have is
just right, and the --",00:23:44.840,00:23:47.690
"so that this idea of a
basis will be central.",00:23:47.690,00:23:51.210
"I'll always be asking
you now for a basis.",00:23:51.210,00:23:54.480
"Whenever I look at a
subspace, if I ask you for --",00:23:54.480,00:23:58.760
"if you give me a basis
for that subspace,",00:23:58.760,00:24:00.760
you've told me what it is.,00:24:00.760,00:24:02.920
"You've told me everything I need
to know about that subspace.",00:24:02.920,00:24:07.430
"Those -- I take their
combinations and I know that I",00:24:07.430,00:24:10.520
need all the combinations.,00:24:10.520,00:24:12.460
OK.,00:24:12.460,00:24:13.210
Examples.,00:24:13.210,00:24:13.790
"OK, so examples of a basis.",00:24:13.790,00:24:16.640
"Let me start with two
dimensional space.",00:24:16.640,00:24:20.060
"Suppose the space
-- say example.",00:24:20.060,00:24:22.350
"The space is, oh,
let's make it R^3.",00:24:26.520,00:24:31.150
Real three dimensional space.,00:24:31.150,00:24:35.980
Give me one basis.,00:24:35.980,00:24:37.330
One basis is?,00:24:37.330,00:24:38.705
"So I want some vectors, because
if I ask you for a basis,",00:24:43.970,00:24:49.010
"I'm asking you for vectors,
a little list of vectors.",00:24:49.010,00:24:53.390
And it should be just right.,00:24:53.390,00:24:57.610
"So what would be a basis
for three dimensional space?",00:24:57.610,00:25:02.880
"Well, the first basis that
comes to mind, why don't we",00:25:02.880,00:25:05.540
write that down.,00:25:05.540,00:25:07.240
"The first basis
that comes to mind",00:25:07.240,00:25:09.220
"is this vector, this
vector, and this vector.",00:25:09.220,00:25:18.850
OK.,00:25:18.850,00:25:19.790
That's one basis.,00:25:19.790,00:25:23.540
"Not the only basis, that's
going to be my point.",00:25:23.540,00:25:27.190
"But let's just see --
yes, that's a basis.",00:25:27.190,00:25:30.930
"Are, are those
vectors independent?",00:25:30.930,00:25:33.500
"So that's the like the x, y,
z axes, so if those are not",00:25:36.110,00:25:40.120
"independent, we're in trouble.",00:25:40.120,00:25:41.780
"Certainly, they are.",00:25:41.780,00:25:43.580
"Take a combination c1 of this
vector plus c2 of this vector",00:25:43.580,00:25:48.630
"plus c3 of that
vector and try to make",00:25:48.630,00:25:51.340
it give the zero vector.,00:25:51.340,00:25:55.290
What are the c-s?,00:25:55.290,00:25:57.110
"If c1 of that plus c2 of that
plus c3 of that gives me 0 0 0,",00:25:57.110,00:26:03.080
then the c-s are all --,00:26:03.080,00:26:05.600
"0, right.",00:26:05.600,00:26:06.920
"So that's the test
for independence.",00:26:06.920,00:26:09.980
"In the language of matrices,
which was under that board,",00:26:09.980,00:26:16.210
"I could make those the
columns of a matrix.",00:26:16.210,00:26:19.700
"Well, it would be
the identity matrix.",00:26:19.700,00:26:22.880
"Then I would ask, what's the
null space of the identity",00:26:22.880,00:26:25.590
matrix?,00:26:25.590,00:26:26.760
"And you would say it's
only the zero vector.",00:26:26.760,00:26:30.560
"And I would say, fine, then
the columns are independent.",00:26:30.560,00:26:34.740
"The only thing -- the identity
times a vector giving zero,",00:26:34.740,00:26:38.370
"the only vector that
does that is zero.",00:26:38.370,00:26:40.810
OK.,00:26:40.810,00:26:41.980
Now that's not the only basis.,00:26:41.980,00:26:45.710
Far from it.,00:26:45.710,00:26:46.660
"Tell me another basis, a
second basis, another basis.",00:26:46.660,00:26:50.680
"So, give me -- well,
I'll just start it out.",00:26:57.560,00:27:03.030
One one two.,00:27:03.030,00:27:04.090
Two two five.,00:27:06.950,00:27:10.780
Suppose I stopped there.,00:27:10.780,00:27:14.420
"Has that little bunch of
vectors got the properties that",00:27:14.420,00:27:20.980

a basis for R^3?",00:27:20.980,00:27:24.350

Yes.,00:27:30.430,00:27:31.330

No.,00:27:33.610,00:27:34.340

some vectors in R3 that",00:27:37.550,00:27:41.640
are not combinations of those.,00:27:41.640,00:27:44.120

So suppose I add in --,00:27:44.930,00:27:47.830
"I need another vector
then, because these two",00:27:47.830,00:27:50.390
don't span the space.,00:27:50.390,00:27:52.021
OK.,00:27:52.021,00:27:52.520
"Now it would be foolish for me
to put in three three seven,",00:27:52.520,00:27:56.360
"right, as the third vector.",00:27:56.360,00:27:58.810
That would be a goof.,00:27:58.810,00:27:59.950
"Because that, if I put
in three three seven,",00:27:59.950,00:28:03.380
"those vectors would
be dependent, right?",00:28:03.380,00:28:07.680
"If I put in three
three seven, it",00:28:07.680,00:28:09.440
"would be the sum
of those two, it",00:28:09.440,00:28:12.170
"would lie in the
same plane as those.",00:28:12.170,00:28:15.020
It wouldn't be independent.,00:28:15.020,00:28:18.590
"My attempt to create
a basis would be dead.",00:28:18.590,00:28:21.930
"But if I take -- so
what vector can I take?",00:28:21.930,00:28:26.420
"I can take any vector
that's not in that plane.",00:28:26.420,00:28:30.340
Let me try --,00:28:30.340,00:28:31.430
I hope that 3 3 8 would do it.,00:28:31.430,00:28:33.590
"At least it's not the
sum of those two vectors.",00:28:37.340,00:28:40.470
But I believe that's a basis.,00:28:40.470,00:28:44.160
"And what's the test then,
for that to be a basis?",00:28:44.160,00:28:49.310
"Because I just picked those
numbers, and if I had picked,",00:28:49.310,00:28:53.160
"5 7 -14 how would we know do
we have a basis or don't we?",00:28:53.160,00:29:02.300
"You would put them in
the columns of a matrix,",00:29:02.300,00:29:05.430
"and you would do
elimination, row reduction --",00:29:05.430,00:29:09.280
"and you would see do you
get any free variables",00:29:09.280,00:29:15.340
"or are all the
columns pivot columns.",00:29:15.340,00:29:18.500
"Well now actually
we have a square --",00:29:18.500,00:29:20.590
"the matrix would
be three by three.",00:29:20.590,00:29:22.760
"So, what's the test
on the matrix then?",00:29:22.760,00:29:26.260
"The matrix -- so in this case,
when my space is R^3 and I have",00:29:29.280,00:29:34.790
"three vectors, my matrix is
square and what I asking about",00:29:34.790,00:29:44.740
"that matrix in order for
those columns to be a basis?",00:29:44.740,00:29:49.780
So in this --,00:29:49.780,00:29:51.190
"for R^n, if I have -- n vectors
give a basis if the n by n",00:29:51.190,00:30:06.380
"matrix with those columns,
with those columns, is what?",00:30:06.380,00:30:19.850
"What's the requirement
on that matrix?",00:30:19.850,00:30:24.070
"Invertible, right, right.",00:30:24.070,00:30:27.010
The matrix should be invertible.,00:30:27.010,00:30:28.590
"For a square matrix, that's
the, that's the perfect answer.",00:30:28.590,00:30:33.187
Is invertible.,00:30:33.187,00:30:33.770
"So that's when, that's when the
space is the whole space R^n.",00:30:38.260,00:30:43.380
"Let me, let me be sure
you're with me here.",00:30:46.140,00:30:50.360
Let me remove that.,00:30:50.360,00:30:53.540
"Are those two vectors a
basis for any space at all?",00:30:53.540,00:31:01.580
"Is there a vector
space that those really",00:31:01.580,00:31:04.020
"are a basis for, those, that
pair of vectors, this guy",00:31:04.020,00:31:08.540
"and this 1, 1 1 2 and 2 2 5?",00:31:08.540,00:31:11.580
"Is there a space for
which that's a basis?",00:31:11.580,00:31:15.360
Sure.,00:31:15.360,00:31:16.220
"They're independent, so they
satisfy the first requirement,",00:31:16.220,00:31:21.970
"so what space shall I take
for them to be a basis",00:31:21.970,00:31:24.740
of?,00:31:24.740,00:31:25.240
"What spaces will
they be a basis for?",00:31:25.240,00:31:29.080
The one they span.,00:31:29.080,00:31:31.180
Their combinations.,00:31:31.180,00:31:32.350
"It's a plane, right?",00:31:32.350,00:31:33.920
It'll be a plane inside R^3.,00:31:33.920,00:31:36.340
"So if I take this vector
1 1 2, say it goes there,",00:31:36.340,00:31:40.930
"and this vector 2 2
5, say it goes there,",00:31:40.930,00:31:44.240
"those are a basis for --
because they span a plane.",00:31:44.240,00:31:50.797
"And they're a basis for
the plane, because they're",00:31:50.797,00:31:52.880
independent.,00:31:52.880,00:31:53.550
"If I stick in some
third guy, like 3 3 7,",00:31:53.550,00:31:56.800
"which is in the plane -- suppose
I put in, try to put in 3 3 7,",00:31:56.800,00:32:01.050
"then the three vectors
would still span the plane,",00:32:01.050,00:32:05.740
"but they wouldn't be a basis
anymore because they're not",00:32:05.740,00:32:09.180
independent anymore.,00:32:09.180,00:32:12.260
"So, we're looking at
the question of --",00:32:12.260,00:32:19.420
"again,",00:32:19.420,00:32:21.360
"OK. the case with
independent columns",00:32:21.360,00:32:25.390
"is the case where the column
vectors span the column space.",00:32:25.390,00:32:32.090
"They're independent, so they're
a basis for the column space.",00:32:32.090,00:32:35.830
OK.,00:32:35.830,00:32:36.520
"So now there's one
bit of intuition.",00:32:36.520,00:32:42.490
Let me go back to all of R^n.,00:32:42.490,00:32:46.420
So I -- where I put 3 3 8.,00:32:46.420,00:32:48.150
OK.,00:32:51.110,00:32:51.740
"The first message is that the
basis is not unique, right.",00:32:51.740,00:32:56.510
There's zillions of bases.,00:32:56.510,00:32:58.090
"I take any invertible
three by three matrix,",00:32:58.090,00:33:02.790
its columns are a basis for R^3.,00:33:02.790,00:33:07.800
"The column space is
R^3, and if those,",00:33:07.800,00:33:11.200
"if that matrix is invertible,
those columns are independent,",00:33:11.200,00:33:15.180
I've got a basis for R^3.,00:33:15.180,00:33:17.100
"So there're many, many bases.",00:33:17.100,00:33:19.860
"But there is something in
common for all those bases.",00:33:19.860,00:33:27.730
"There's something that this
basis shares with that basis",00:33:27.730,00:33:32.810
and every other basis for R^3.,00:33:32.810,00:33:35.880
And what's that?,00:33:35.880,00:33:37.515
"Well, you saw it coming, because
when I stopped here and asked",00:33:40.040,00:33:47.410
"if that was a basis
for R^3, you said no.",00:33:47.410,00:33:51.180
"And I know that you said
no because you knew there",00:33:51.180,00:33:54.730
weren't enough vectors there.,00:33:54.730,00:33:57.410
"And the great fact is that
there're many, many bases,",00:33:57.410,00:34:03.670
"but -- let me put in somebody
else, just for variety.",00:34:03.670,00:34:12.139
"There are many, many
bases, but they all",00:34:12.139,00:34:14.850
have the same number of vectors.,00:34:14.850,00:34:18.639
"If we're talking
about the space R^3,",00:34:18.639,00:34:21.350
"then that number of
vectors is three.",00:34:21.350,00:34:25.040
"If we're talking
about the space R^n,",00:34:25.040,00:34:27.650
"then that number
of vectors is n.",00:34:27.650,00:34:31.320
"If we're talking about
some other space,",00:34:31.320,00:34:36.389
"the column space of some matrix,
or the null space of some",00:34:36.389,00:34:41.570
"matrix, or some other space
that we haven't even thought",00:34:41.570,00:34:45.420
"of, then that still is
true that every basis --",00:34:45.420,00:34:52.820
"that there're lots of bases but
every basis has the same number",00:34:52.820,00:34:57.270
of vectors.,00:34:57.270,00:34:57.950
"Let me write that
great fact down.",00:34:57.950,00:35:02.000
"Every basis --
we're given a space.",00:35:02.000,00:35:07.940
Given a space.,00:35:07.940,00:35:10.680
"R^3 or R^n or some other column
space of a matrix or the null",00:35:13.950,00:35:18.840
"space of a matrix or
some other vector space.",00:35:18.840,00:35:21.790
"Then the great fact
is that every basis",00:35:21.790,00:35:25.200
"for this, for the space has
the same number of vectors.",00:35:25.200,00:35:40.365
"If one basis has six vectors,
then every other basis",00:35:47.750,00:35:50.770
has six vectors.,00:35:50.770,00:35:52.770
"So that number six
is telling me like",00:35:52.770,00:35:56.050
"it's telling me how
big is the space.",00:35:56.050,00:35:59.250
"It's telling me
how many vectors do",00:35:59.250,00:36:01.640
I have to have to have a basis.,00:36:01.640,00:36:04.650
"And of course we're
seeing it this way.",00:36:04.650,00:36:08.440
"That number six, if
we had seven vectors,",00:36:08.440,00:36:10.900
then we've got too many.,00:36:10.900,00:36:13.150
"If we have five vectors
we haven't got enough.",00:36:13.150,00:36:17.070
"Sixes are like just right
for whatever space that is.",00:36:17.070,00:36:21.860
And what do we call that number?,00:36:21.860,00:36:24.600
"That number is -- now I'm ready
for the last definition today.",00:36:24.600,00:36:29.550
"It's the dimension
of that space.",00:36:29.550,00:36:33.650
"So every basis for a space has
the same number of vectors in",00:36:33.650,00:36:37.410
it.,00:36:37.410,00:36:37.910
"Not the same vectors,
all sorts of bases --",00:36:37.910,00:36:41.860
"but the same number of
vectors is always the same,",00:36:41.860,00:36:44.850
"and that number
is the dimension.",00:36:44.850,00:36:47.010
This is definitional.,00:36:47.010,00:36:47.900
"This number is the
dimension of the space.",00:36:50.780,00:36:58.245
OK.,00:37:03.390,00:37:03.890
OK.,00:37:06.670,00:37:08.417
Let's do some examples.,00:37:08.417,00:37:09.375
"Because now we've
got definitions.",00:37:12.930,00:37:14.410
"Let me repeat the four
things, the four words that",00:37:14.410,00:37:17.550
have now got defined.,00:37:17.550,00:37:19.270
"Independence, that looks
at combinations not",00:37:19.270,00:37:23.320
being zero.,00:37:23.320,00:37:24.560
"Spanning, that looks at
all the combinations.",00:37:24.560,00:37:27.700
"Basis, that's the
one that combines",00:37:27.700,00:37:30.580
independence and spanning.,00:37:30.580,00:37:32.360
"And now we've got the idea
of the dimension of a space.",00:37:32.360,00:37:36.460
"It's the number of
vectors in any basis,",00:37:36.460,00:37:40.470
"because all bases
have the same number.",00:37:40.470,00:37:43.160
OK.,00:37:43.160,00:37:44.580
Let's take examples.,00:37:44.580,00:37:47.750
"Suppose I take, my space
is -- examples now --",00:37:47.750,00:37:53.790
"space is the, say, the
column space of this matrix.",00:37:53.790,00:37:58.170
Let me write down a matrix.,00:37:58.170,00:38:00.240
"1 1 1, 2 1 2, and I'll
-- just to make it clear,",00:38:00.240,00:38:06.370
"I'll take the sum there, 3 2 3,
and let me take the sum of all",00:38:06.370,00:38:12.430
"-- oh, let me put
in one -- yeah,",00:38:12.430,00:38:15.050
I'll put in one one one again.,00:38:15.050,00:38:18.530
OK.,00:38:18.530,00:38:20.300
So that's four vectors.,00:38:20.300,00:38:21.260
"OK, do they span the column
space of that matrix?",00:38:24.710,00:38:29.310
"Let me repeat, do they span the
column space of that matrix?",00:38:29.310,00:38:35.290
"By definition, that's
what the column space --",00:38:35.290,00:38:37.700
Yes. where it comes from.,00:38:37.700,00:38:39.280
"Are they a basis for
the column space?",00:38:39.280,00:38:41.470
Are they independent?,00:38:41.470,00:38:43.920
"No, they're not independent.",00:38:43.920,00:38:45.860
"There's something
in that null space.",00:38:45.860,00:38:49.460
"Maybe we can -- so let's look
at the null space of the matrix.",00:38:49.460,00:38:55.140
"Tell me a vector that's in
the null space of that matrix.",00:38:55.140,00:38:58.490
"So I'm looking for some vector
that combines those columns",00:39:01.090,00:39:05.320
and produces the zero column.,00:39:05.320,00:39:08.350
"Or in other words, I'm
looking for solutions",00:39:08.350,00:39:10.680
to A X equals zero.,00:39:10.680,00:39:12.280
"So tell me a vector
in the null space.",00:39:12.280,00:39:16.930
"Maybe -- well, this was, this
column was that one plus that",00:39:16.930,00:39:21.070
"one, so maybe if I have one of
those and minus one of those",00:39:21.070,00:39:25.030
"that would be a
vector in the null",00:39:25.030,00:39:26.560
space.,00:39:26.560,00:39:27.060
"So, you've already told me now,
are those vectors independent,",00:39:29.450,00:39:33.440
"the answer is -- those column
vectors, the answer is --",00:39:33.440,00:39:38.140
no.,00:39:38.140,00:39:38.670
Right?,00:39:38.670,00:39:39.170
They're not independent.,00:39:39.170,00:39:40.770
"Because -- you knew they
weren't independent.",00:39:40.770,00:39:44.060
"Anyway, minus one
of this minus one",00:39:44.060,00:39:47.060
"of this plus one of this zero
of that is the zero vector.",00:39:47.060,00:39:50.530
"OK, so they're not independent.",00:39:54.120,00:39:55.660
OK.,00:39:55.660,00:39:55.720
"They span, but they're
not independent.",00:39:55.720,00:39:57.500
"Tell me a basis for
that column space.",00:39:57.500,00:40:04.560
"What's a basis for
the column space?",00:40:04.560,00:40:06.300
"These are all the questions that
the homework asks, the quizzes",00:40:06.300,00:40:09.220
"ask, the final exam will ask.",00:40:09.220,00:40:11.800
"Find a basis for the column
space of this matrix.",00:40:11.800,00:40:17.710
OK.,00:40:17.710,00:40:20.280
"Now there's many
answers, but give me",00:40:20.280,00:40:22.500
the most natural answer.,00:40:22.500,00:40:25.590
Columns one and two.,00:40:25.590,00:40:29.670
Columns one and two.,00:40:29.670,00:40:31.170
That's the natural answer.,00:40:31.170,00:40:32.410
"Those are the pivot
columns, because, I mean,",00:40:32.410,00:40:35.320
we s- we begin systematically.,00:40:35.320,00:40:37.140
"We look at the first
column, it's OK.",00:40:37.140,00:40:39.300
We can put that in the basis.,00:40:39.300,00:40:41.330
"We look at the second
column, it's OK.",00:40:41.330,00:40:43.550
We can put that in the basis.,00:40:43.550,00:40:46.300
"The third column we
can't put in the basis.",00:40:46.300,00:40:48.960
"The fourth column
we can't, again.",00:40:48.960,00:40:54.070
So the rank of the matrix is --,00:40:54.070,00:40:57.570
what's the rank of our matrix?,00:40:57.570,00:40:59.850
Two.,00:40:59.850,00:41:01.210
Two.,00:41:01.210,00:41:02.000
"And, and now that rank is also
-- we also have another word.",00:41:02.000,00:41:06.610
"We, we have a
great theorem here.",00:41:06.610,00:41:08.710
"The rank of A, that rank r,
is the number of pivot columns",00:41:08.710,00:41:23.060
and it's also --,00:41:23.060,00:41:25.340
"well, so now please
use my new word.",00:41:25.340,00:41:27.890
"This, it's the number
two, of course,",00:41:32.640,00:41:34.700
"two is the rank
of my matrix, it's",00:41:34.700,00:41:41.790
"the number of pivot columns,
those pivot columns form",00:41:41.790,00:41:44.440
"a basis, of course,
so what's two?",00:41:44.440,00:41:49.104
It's the dimension.,00:41:49.104,00:41:49.895
"The rank of A, the
number of pivot columns,",00:41:52.820,00:41:55.580
"is the dimension of
the column space.",00:41:55.580,00:42:02.555
"Of course, you say.",00:42:07.450,00:42:08.840
It had to be.,00:42:08.840,00:42:10.670
Right.,00:42:10.670,00:42:12.000
"But just watch, look
for one moment at the,",00:42:12.000,00:42:17.440
"the language, the
way the English words",00:42:17.440,00:42:20.240
get involved here.,00:42:20.240,00:42:21.810
"I take the rank of a matrix,
the rank of a matrix.",00:42:21.810,00:42:28.610
"It's a number of columns
and it's the dimension of --",00:42:28.610,00:42:34.580
"not the dimension of the matrix,
that's what I want to say.",00:42:34.580,00:42:37.810
"It's the dimension of a space,
a subspace, the column space.",00:42:37.810,00:42:43.890
"Do you see, I don't
take the dimension of A.",00:42:43.890,00:42:46.800
That's not what I want.,00:42:46.800,00:42:49.600
"I'm looking for the dimension
of the column space of A.",00:42:49.600,00:42:53.190
"If you use those words right,
it shows you've got the idea",00:42:53.190,00:42:56.050
right.,00:42:56.050,00:42:57.400
Similarly here.,00:42:57.400,00:42:59.170
"I don't talk about the
rank of a subspace.",00:42:59.170,00:43:03.430
It's a matrix that has a rank.,00:43:03.430,00:43:05.440
"I talk about the
rank of a matrix.",00:43:05.440,00:43:08.040
"And the beauty is that
these definitions just",00:43:08.040,00:43:11.750
"merge so that the
rank of a matrix",00:43:11.750,00:43:14.160
"is the dimension of
its column space.",00:43:14.160,00:43:16.170
And in this example it's two.,00:43:16.170,00:43:18.840
"And then the further
question is, what's a basis?",00:43:18.840,00:43:22.570
"And the first two
columns are a basis.",00:43:22.570,00:43:25.450
Tell me another basis.,00:43:25.450,00:43:27.500
"Another basis for
the columns space.",00:43:27.500,00:43:29.710
"You see I just keep
hammering away.",00:43:29.710,00:43:31.390
"I apologize, but it's,
I have to be sure you",00:43:31.390,00:43:35.140
have the idea of basis.,00:43:35.140,00:43:36.660
"Tell me another basis
for the column space.",00:43:36.660,00:43:40.940
"Well, you could take
columns one and three.",00:43:40.940,00:43:47.410
"That would be a basis
for the column space.",00:43:47.410,00:43:49.930
"Or columns two and
three would be a basis.",00:43:49.930,00:43:53.220
Or columns two and four.,00:43:53.220,00:43:55.660
"Or tell me another basis that's
not made out of those columns",00:43:55.660,00:43:58.871
at all?,00:43:58.871,00:43:59.370
"So -- I guess I'm giving you
infinitely many possibilities,",00:44:03.290,00:44:07.180
"so I can't expect a
unanimous answer here.",00:44:07.180,00:44:11.150
"I'll tell you -- but let's
look at another basis, though.",00:44:11.150,00:44:14.770
"I'll just -- because it's
only one out of zillions,",00:44:14.770,00:44:17.836
"I'm going to put it down
and I'm going to erase it.",00:44:17.836,00:44:19.960
"Another basis for the
column space would be --",00:44:19.960,00:44:26.680
let's see.,00:44:26.680,00:44:27.879
"I'll put in some things
that are not there.",00:44:27.879,00:44:29.670
"Say, oh well, just to make
it -- my life easy, 2 2 2.",00:44:29.670,00:44:33.830
That's in the column space.,00:44:33.830,00:44:37.040
"And, that was sort of obvious.",00:44:37.040,00:44:40.380
"Let me take the sum
of those, say 6 4 6.",00:44:40.380,00:44:43.458
"Or the sum of all of the
columns, 7 5 7, why not.",00:44:46.810,00:44:52.040
That's in the column space.,00:44:52.040,00:44:54.910
"Those are independent and
I've got the number right,",00:44:54.910,00:44:59.540
I've got two.,00:44:59.540,00:45:01.290
"Actually, this is a key point.",00:45:01.290,00:45:02.940
"If you know the dimension of
the space you're working with,",00:45:05.890,00:45:09.170
"and we know that this column
-- we know that the dimension,",00:45:09.170,00:45:14.480
"DIM, the dimension of
the column space is two.",00:45:14.480,00:45:19.430
"If you know the
dimension, then --",00:45:23.730,00:45:30.120
"and we have a couple of
vectors that are independent,",00:45:30.120,00:45:33.670
they'll automatically be a,00:45:33.670,00:45:35.710
basis.,00:45:35.710,00:45:36.550
"If we've got the number
of vectors right,",00:45:36.550,00:45:38.890
"two vectors in this case,
then if they're independent,",00:45:38.890,00:45:43.760
"they can't help
but span the space.",00:45:43.760,00:45:47.037
"Because if they
didn't span the space,",00:45:47.037,00:45:48.620
"there'd be a third guy
to help span the space,",00:45:48.620,00:45:52.130
but it couldn't be independent.,00:45:52.130,00:45:54.160
"So, it just has
to be independent",00:45:54.160,00:45:58.190
if we've got the numbers right.,00:45:58.190,00:46:01.640
And they span.,00:46:01.640,00:46:02.590
OK.,00:46:02.590,00:46:03.280
Very good.,00:46:03.280,00:46:04.100
"So you got the
dimension of a space.",00:46:04.100,00:46:06.060
"So this was another basis
that I just invented.",00:46:06.060,00:46:08.870
OK.,00:46:08.870,00:46:09.470
"Now, now I get to ask
about the null space.",00:46:09.470,00:46:16.270
"What's the dimension
of the null space?",00:46:16.270,00:46:18.320
"So we, we got a
great fact there,",00:46:18.320,00:46:20.700
"the dimension of the
column space is the rank.",00:46:20.700,00:46:28.560
"Now I want to ask you
about the null space.",00:46:28.560,00:46:30.760
"That's the other
part of the lecture,",00:46:30.760,00:46:34.190
"and it'll go on to
the next lecture.",00:46:34.190,00:46:38.320
OK.,00:46:38.320,00:46:40.320
"So we know the dimension of the
column space is two, the rank.",00:46:40.320,00:46:44.230
What about the null space?,00:46:44.230,00:46:46.280
"This is a vector
in the null space.",00:46:46.280,00:46:47.870
"Are there other vectors
in the null space?",00:46:47.870,00:46:49.770
Yes or no?,00:46:52.280,00:46:53.530
Yes.,00:46:53.530,00:46:54.870
"So this isn't a basis because
it's doesn't span, right?",00:46:54.870,00:46:58.820
"There's more in the null
space than we've got so far.",00:46:58.820,00:47:01.970
I need another vector at least.,00:47:01.970,00:47:04.570
"So tell me another
vector in the null space.",00:47:04.570,00:47:08.790
"Well, the natural choice, the
choice you naturally think of",00:47:08.790,00:47:12.290
"is I'm going on to
the fourth column,",00:47:12.290,00:47:16.140
"I'm letting that free
variable be a one,",00:47:16.140,00:47:20.210
"and that free variable
be a zero, and I'm asking",00:47:20.210,00:47:23.750
"is that fourth
column a combination",00:47:23.750,00:47:26.130
of my pivot columns?,00:47:26.130,00:47:27.410
"Yes, it is.",00:47:27.410,00:47:28.670
And it's -- that will do.,00:47:28.670,00:47:31.650
"So what I've written
there are actually the two",00:47:35.730,00:47:37.820
"special solutions, right?",00:47:37.820,00:47:39.860
"I took the two free
variables, free and free.",00:47:39.860,00:47:44.520
"I gave them the values 1 0
or 0 I figured out the rest.",00:47:44.520,00:47:50.410
"So do you see, let me
just say it in words.",00:47:50.410,00:47:53.640
"This vector, these vectors in
the null space are telling me,",00:47:53.640,00:47:58.000
"they're telling me
the combinations",00:47:58.000,00:48:00.190
of the columns that give zero.,00:48:00.190,00:48:02.610
"They're telling me in what way
the, the columns are dependent.",00:48:02.610,00:48:08.770
"That's what the
null space is doing.",00:48:08.770,00:48:10.770
Have I got enough now?,00:48:10.770,00:48:13.890
And what's the null space now?,00:48:13.890,00:48:15.780
"We have to think
about the null space.",00:48:15.780,00:48:18.540
"These are two vectors
in the null space.",00:48:18.540,00:48:20.740
They're independent.,00:48:20.740,00:48:21.790
"Are they a basis
for the null space?",00:48:21.790,00:48:24.620
"What's the dimension
of the null space?",00:48:24.620,00:48:27.650
"You see that those questions
just keep coming up all the",00:48:27.650,00:48:30.100
time.,00:48:30.100,00:48:31.120
"Are they a basis
for the null space?",00:48:31.120,00:48:34.500
"You can tell me the answer
even though we haven't",00:48:34.500,00:48:36.940
written out a proof of that.,00:48:36.940,00:48:39.460
Can you?,00:48:39.460,00:48:40.190
Yes or no?,00:48:40.190,00:48:41.050
"Do these two special
solutions form",00:48:41.050,00:48:44.510
a basis for the null space?,00:48:44.510,00:48:46.400
"In other words,
does the null space",00:48:46.400,00:48:48.790
"consist of all combinations
of those two guys?",00:48:48.790,00:48:52.390
Yes or no?,00:48:52.390,00:48:54.110
Yes.,00:48:54.110,00:48:55.180

two dimensional.",00:48:56.880,00:48:58.970

dimension of the null space,",00:48:58.970,00:49:01.500
is the number of free variables.,00:49:01.500,00:49:03.530
"So the dimension
of the null space",00:49:03.530,00:49:09.330

give me the formula.",00:49:17.260,00:49:21.420

"We have n columns, r of
them are pivot columns,",00:49:36.740,00:49:42.360
