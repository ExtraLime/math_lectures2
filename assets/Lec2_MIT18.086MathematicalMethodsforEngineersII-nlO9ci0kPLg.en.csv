"PROFESSOR: So this is the
second 086 lecture and it'll be",00:00:14.350,00:00:21.340
"my second and last lecture on
solving ordinary differential",00:00:21.340,00:00:27.040
"equations -- u prime
equal f of u and t.",00:00:27.040,00:00:33.270
"So last time, we got Euler's
method, both ordinary,",00:00:33.270,00:00:40.290
"forward Euler, which is this
method for the particular",00:00:40.290,00:00:45.970
"equation -- so I'm using my
model problem, as always,",00:00:45.970,00:00:49.530
u prime equal a*u.,00:00:49.530,00:00:51.440
That's the model.,00:00:51.440,00:00:54.090
"And I'm using small u for
the true solution and capital",00:00:54.090,00:00:59.530
U for the approximation.,00:00:59.530,00:01:02.210
"By whatever method we use,
and right now, that method",00:01:02.210,00:01:05.380
is forward Euler.,00:01:05.380,00:01:09.050
"We looked at the
idea of stability,",00:01:09.050,00:01:11.720
"but now let me
follow up right away",00:01:11.720,00:01:15.760
with the point of stability.,00:01:15.760,00:01:18.160
Where does stability come in?,00:01:18.160,00:01:20.740
"So I want to do that for
this simplest of all methods,",00:01:20.740,00:01:24.740
"because you'll see how we
get to an error equation",00:01:24.740,00:01:32.820
"and we'll get to a similar
error equation for much",00:01:32.820,00:01:36.610
better methods.,00:01:36.610,00:01:38.710
"So the accuracy of
Euler is minimal,",00:01:38.710,00:01:42.630
"but the question of
how stability enters",00:01:42.630,00:01:46.010
"and how we show
that it converges",00:01:46.010,00:01:49.740
"will be the same, also in
partial differential equations,",00:01:49.740,00:01:52.880
so this is the place to see it.,00:01:52.880,00:01:55.670
"So I'll start with that, but
then after that topic will",00:01:55.670,00:02:02.410
"come better methods than
Euler and the first step",00:02:02.410,00:02:06.680
"will be, of course,
second-order methods,",00:02:06.680,00:02:09.240
"because Euler and backward
Euler are only first-order.",00:02:09.240,00:02:12.440
"And we'll see -- actually,
that'll be the point.",00:02:12.440,00:02:15.300
"Not only will show
when they converge,",00:02:15.300,00:02:18.460
"why they converge, but also
how fast they converge.",00:02:18.460,00:02:21.790
What's the error?,00:02:21.790,00:02:23.460
"This estimate of the
error is something",00:02:23.460,00:02:25.410
"that every code is going
to somehow use internally",00:02:25.410,00:02:29.700
"to control the
step size delta t.",00:02:29.700,00:02:33.530
"So I'm just going to go
with the model problem,",00:02:33.530,00:02:36.380
"u prime equal a*u,
the Euler method.",00:02:36.380,00:02:40.260
"So here is the evaluation
-- a*u is f there,",00:02:40.260,00:02:45.200
"so it's really delta
t multiplying f,",00:02:45.200,00:02:48.760
"which is just a*u
in this easy case.",00:02:48.760,00:02:51.600
"Here's the true
solution and then",00:02:51.600,00:02:53.460
"here is the new point, that
when I plug the true solution",00:02:53.460,00:02:58.460
"in to the difference
equation, it, of course,",00:02:58.460,00:03:03.320
doesn't satisfy exactly.,00:03:03.320,00:03:05.800
"There's some error term -- this,
I would call the discretization",00:03:05.800,00:03:10.510
"error -- making the
problem discrete.",00:03:10.510,00:03:15.030
"So this is the, you could say,
the error at a single time step",00:03:19.040,00:03:23.600
"-- it's the new error that's
introduced at time step n.",00:03:23.600,00:03:28.510
"Error, now, is going to be
-- e will be u, the true one,",00:03:32.370,00:03:38.220
"minus the approximate, so I
just subtract to get an equation",00:03:38.220,00:03:43.970
"for the error at
time step n plus 1.",00:03:43.970,00:03:48.830
"That subtraction
gives e_n, a delta t.",00:03:48.830,00:03:52.210
"That subtraction gives e_n, and
this is the inhomogeneous term,",00:03:52.210,00:03:59.360
"you could say, the new error.",00:03:59.360,00:04:02.620
"So the question is -- first, the
question is, what size is that,",00:04:02.620,00:04:08.240
the local error?,00:04:08.240,00:04:10.340
"Then the key question is, when I
combine all these local errors,",00:04:10.340,00:04:17.830
what's the global error?,00:04:17.830,00:04:20.460
"So first, the local error.",00:04:20.460,00:04:23.890
"You can see what this
is, approximately,",00:04:23.890,00:04:27.090
"because the true solution would
be e to the a*t and we all know",00:04:27.090,00:04:34.200
"that e to the a*t times
u_0 -- e to the at --",00:04:34.200,00:04:40.990
"there's a 1 plus an a delta
-- from a single time step --",00:04:40.990,00:04:47.470
"sorry, I should have said the
true solution would grow by e",00:04:47.470,00:04:53.420
to the a delta t over one step.,00:04:53.420,00:04:56.700
"It would multiply by
e to the a delta t,",00:04:56.700,00:05:00.080
"but instead of multiplying
by that exponential e",00:05:00.080,00:05:03.190
"to the a delta t, we're only
multiplying by the first two",00:05:03.190,00:05:06.510
terms in the series.,00:05:06.510,00:05:08.940
"So the error here is going to
be something like a half delta t",00:05:08.940,00:05:18.220
"squared -- that's the key point
where we see the local error --",00:05:18.220,00:05:25.830
"times probably a squared --
we needed an a squared and u.",00:05:25.830,00:05:38.840
"So a squared u_n,
that would really",00:05:38.840,00:05:42.820
be the second derivative.,00:05:42.820,00:05:44.240
"I'll put it in as
second derivative,",00:05:44.240,00:05:46.740
"because that's what it would
look like in a nonlinear case.",00:05:46.740,00:05:53.390
"So I'm working the linear
case for simplicity,",00:05:53.390,00:05:56.840
"but the point is that this
is the Euler local error.",00:05:56.840,00:06:03.360
"That's so typical,
that you really",00:06:03.360,00:06:05.250
"want to look at that local
error, see what it looks like.",00:06:05.250,00:06:09.280
"There is some constant and
that has a certain effect",00:06:09.280,00:06:13.840
on the quality of the method.,00:06:13.840,00:06:17.310
"There's a power of delta
t and the question,",00:06:17.310,00:06:19.720
"what is that exponent
has a big effect.",00:06:19.720,00:06:22.660
"So that exponent is
the order plus 1.",00:06:22.660,00:06:29.430
"So for me, Euler's method
has accuracy p equal 1.",00:06:29.430,00:06:35.100
"Over a single delta t step,
the error is delta t squared,",00:06:35.100,00:06:41.710
"but we'll see that when I
take 1 over delta t steps",00:06:41.710,00:06:46.550
"to get somewhere, to get
to some fixed time like 1,",00:06:46.550,00:06:51.330
"then I have one over
delta t of these things",00:06:51.330,00:06:55.760
"and the 2 comes back down to
the 1, which I expect for Euler.",00:06:55.760,00:07:00.860
"And finally, this term is out
of our control, basically.",00:07:00.860,00:07:07.550
"That's coming from the
differential equation.",00:07:07.550,00:07:11.680
"That would tell us how
hard or easy the method",00:07:11.680,00:07:16.950
"is, the equation is.",00:07:16.950,00:07:20.020
"So if u double
prime is real big,",00:07:20.020,00:07:22.770
"we're going to expect to have
to reduce delta t to keep this",00:07:22.770,00:07:26.590
"error under control, so
that's a typical term --",00:07:26.590,00:07:30.300
"a constant delta t to a power
of p plus 1 and the p plus first",00:07:30.300,00:07:37.550
"derivative, the second
derivative matching that 2",00:07:37.550,00:07:41.430
of the solution.,00:07:41.430,00:07:43.050
"So that's -- if
I now put this --",00:07:43.050,00:07:49.990
"think of that as here in the
-- as the sort of inhomogeneous",00:07:49.990,00:07:56.670
term or the new source term.,00:07:56.670,00:08:00.680
I just want to estimate e_n now.,00:08:00.680,00:08:03.410
"So I've done the local
part and now I'm interested",00:08:03.410,00:08:06.260
in putting it all together.,00:08:06.260,00:08:09.050
"How do I look at e -- so
I really want, somehow,",00:08:09.050,00:08:12.750
"the solution -- e at some
definite time n is what?",00:08:12.750,00:08:21.240
"I'm asking, really, for the
solution to this system,",00:08:21.240,00:08:27.450
"and sort of in words
-- so that's a good --",00:08:27.450,00:08:35.470
"a totally typical
error equation.",00:08:35.470,00:08:39.600
"I think the way to
look at it in words",00:08:42.440,00:08:44.720
"is, at each step, some new
term, new error is committed,",00:08:44.720,00:08:52.480
"and what happens to that
error at later steps?",00:08:52.480,00:08:58.090
"At later steps, that
error committed then",00:08:58.090,00:09:01.710
"gets multiplied by 1 plus a
delta t at the next step and 1",00:09:01.710,00:09:06.110
"plus a delta t at
the following step.",00:09:06.110,00:09:08.780
"So I think we have something
like, after n steps,",00:09:08.780,00:09:14.300
"we would have 1 plus a delta
t to the n-th times the error",00:09:14.300,00:09:22.480
"that we did -- our
first step error.",00:09:22.480,00:09:24.750
"So that's -- you see
what's happening here?",00:09:28.390,00:09:31.010
"Whatever error we commit
grows or decays according",00:09:31.010,00:09:35.530
to this growth factor.,00:09:35.530,00:09:38.750
"Then of course, we made
an error at step two",00:09:38.750,00:09:41.230
"and we made an error at
step k, so at step k,",00:09:41.230,00:09:45.490
"it will have n minus
k steps still to grow.",00:09:45.490,00:09:51.370
"This is DE, the
error DE at step k,",00:09:51.370,00:10:03.220
"and all the way through the --
I guess it would end with DE_N.",00:10:03.220,00:10:10.440
"DE_N would be the last
thing that hadn't yet",00:10:10.440,00:10:16.550
started to grow or decay.,00:10:16.550,00:10:18.890
Okay.,00:10:18.890,00:10:19.760
So that's our formula.,00:10:19.760,00:10:22.570
"It looks a little messy,
but it shows everything.",00:10:22.570,00:10:28.860
"It shows the crucial important
of stability and how it enters.",00:10:28.860,00:10:33.980
"Stability controls -- so there
is the error that we made way",00:10:33.980,00:10:37.930
"at the beginning and then
this is the growth factor that",00:10:37.930,00:10:41.960
"happened n time, so you see
that if 1 plus a delta t has",00:10:41.960,00:10:49.870
"magnitude bigger than 1,
what's going to happen?",00:10:49.870,00:10:54.890
"That will explode
and the computer",00:10:54.890,00:11:00.040
"will very quickly show
totally out of bounds output.",00:11:00.040,00:11:10.480
"But if it's stable, if
this thing is less than 1,",00:11:10.480,00:11:15.980
"less or equal to 1, then that
stability means that this error",00:11:15.980,00:11:21.480
"is not growing and so
we get -- so let me put,",00:11:21.480,00:11:27.270
"if we have this stability,
1 plus a delta t,",00:11:27.270,00:11:32.430
"smaller equal 1, then we
get the bound that we want.",00:11:32.430,00:11:35.980
"So can you see what
that looks like?",00:11:35.980,00:11:38.500
"We've got N terms, right?",00:11:41.500,00:11:47.310
"To get to point N, we've made
N errors -- capital N errors --",00:11:47.310,00:11:52.600
"and then each term,
that gives a 1.",00:11:52.600,00:11:57.140
"That's the critical
role of stability.",00:11:57.140,00:12:01.000
"And the error is of this order,
so I'm getting something like",00:12:01.000,00:12:08.270
"a half delta t squared
over 2 times --",00:12:08.270,00:12:16.050
let's say some maximum.,00:12:16.050,00:12:18.350
"I'll use u double prime for
a maximum value, let's say,",00:12:18.350,00:12:24.160
of the second derivative.,00:12:24.160,00:12:27.580
"That's a typical good
satisfactory error estimate.",00:12:27.580,00:12:34.000
So what's up here?,00:12:34.000,00:12:36.060
"So N times delta t --
times one delta t --",00:12:36.060,00:12:39.710
"is the time that
we reached, right?",00:12:39.710,00:12:41.840
"We took N steps,
delta t each step.",00:12:41.840,00:12:45.030
"So this is the same as --
this is what I'm wanting",00:12:45.030,00:12:48.470
"and it's going to
fit on this board --",00:12:48.470,00:12:50.460
"there's a one half T -- I
should make it T over 2, right?",00:12:50.460,00:12:58.490
"N delta t is some time
capital T. We have the half.",00:12:58.490,00:13:04.830
We still have one delta t.,00:13:04.830,00:13:07.180
That's the key.,00:13:07.180,00:13:09.190
"We have this u double
prime, which is fixed.",00:13:09.190,00:13:14.650
"Anyway, we have
first-order convergence.",00:13:14.650,00:13:18.410
"So the error after n steps
goes down like delta t.",00:13:18.410,00:13:24.460
"If I cut the time step in
half, I cut the error in half.",00:13:27.540,00:13:32.710
"So that's not a great
rate of convergence.",00:13:32.710,00:13:36.340
"That's, like, the minimal
rate of convergence --",00:13:36.340,00:13:38.530
just one power delta t.,00:13:38.530,00:13:41.300
"And that's why we call
Euler a first-order method.",00:13:41.300,00:13:44.650
"I think, I hope you've seen and
can kind of -- because we'll --",00:13:47.190,00:13:51.660
"this expression for the solution
is messy but meaningful.",00:13:51.660,00:14:00.110
"That's a little bit of
pure algebra or something",00:14:03.910,00:14:10.510
"that shows how stability
is used, where it enters.",00:14:10.510,00:14:16.630
"So now I'm ready, if you are,
to move to second-order methods.",00:14:16.630,00:14:22.070
"Now we're actually
going to get methods",00:14:24.690,00:14:26.690
that people would really use.,00:14:26.690,00:14:28.280
"So all those methods are,
I think, worth looking at.",00:14:32.340,00:14:38.340
"Can I say that the notes
that are on the web --",00:14:38.340,00:14:41.680
"you may have spotted chapter
five, section one, for example,",00:14:41.680,00:14:46.580
"which is this material --
so I'm -- after the lecture,",00:14:46.580,00:14:51.060
"I always think back, what did
I say and improve those notes,",00:14:51.060,00:14:57.580
"so possibly later this
afternoon a revised,",00:14:57.580,00:15:01.810
"improved version of this
material will go up and then",00:15:01.810,00:15:06.740
"next week starts the real thing,
what I think of as the real",00:15:06.740,00:15:10.870
"thing, the wave equation
and the heat equation --",00:15:10.870,00:15:13.310
"partial differential
equations -- but it's worth --",00:15:13.310,00:15:17.590
here we saw how stability works.,00:15:17.590,00:15:19.970
"Here we're going to see how
accuracy can be increased",00:15:19.970,00:15:24.570
and in different ways.,00:15:24.570,00:15:31.600
"In this way -- so what do I
notice about the trapezoidal",00:15:31.600,00:15:35.580
method?,00:15:35.580,00:15:36.080
"Sometimes it's called
Crank-Nicolson.",00:15:39.670,00:15:43.140
"In PDEs, the same idea was
proposed by Crank and Nicolson.",00:15:43.140,00:15:50.840
So what's their idea?,00:15:50.840,00:15:53.150
"Or what's the trapezoidal
idea in the first place?",00:15:53.150,00:15:57.550
"Basically, we've centered --
we've recentered the method",00:15:57.550,00:16:01.920
at what time position?,00:16:01.920,00:16:04.710
You can go ahead.,00:16:07.280,00:16:09.240
"So where -- instead of
Euler, which was, like,",00:16:09.240,00:16:13.080
"started at time n,
t_n, or backward Euler,",00:16:13.080,00:16:17.190
"that was sort of focused
on the new time, t_(n+1),",00:16:17.190,00:16:21.180
"this combination is at time
n plus a half delta t, right?",00:16:21.180,00:16:29.750
"Somehow we've symmetrized
everything around a half",00:16:29.750,00:16:35.460
"and the point is that
around the midpoint,",00:16:35.460,00:16:42.810
the accuracy jumps up to 2.,00:16:42.810,00:16:44.410
"Let me try, always,
u prime equal a*u.",00:16:48.840,00:16:51.350
So f is a*u.,00:16:54.990,00:16:56.990
Then what does this become?,00:16:56.990,00:17:01.030
"Can I, as you would
have to do in coding it,",00:17:01.030,00:17:04.410
separate the implicit part?,00:17:04.410,00:17:06.590
"This is implicit, of course.",00:17:06.590,00:17:07.930
"That stands for this: f_(n+1)
means f of the new unknown u",00:17:10.620,00:17:17.650
at the new time.,00:17:17.650,00:17:21.060
So it's implicit.,00:17:21.060,00:17:22.340
"So let me bring that
over to the left side,",00:17:26.760,00:17:29.802
"because it's sort of
part of the unknown.",00:17:29.802,00:17:31.510
"I'll multiply through by delta
t and I'll take f to be a*u.",00:17:31.510,00:17:37.490
"So I just want to rewrite
that for our model problem.",00:17:37.490,00:17:41.330
"So it will be 1 minus a
half, when I bring that over,",00:17:41.330,00:17:47.310
minus a delta t over 2 U_(n+1).,00:17:47.310,00:17:52.140
"Is that what I get, when I
multiply through by delta t",00:17:55.110,00:17:58.360
"and bring the
implicit part over?",00:17:58.360,00:18:00.220
"And now I bring the
explicit part to that side,",00:18:00.220,00:18:03.340
"so it's 1 plus a half
delta t a delta t U_n.",00:18:03.340,00:18:10.210
"So that's what we actually
solve at every step.",00:18:12.950,00:18:17.000
"So first of all, I see
that it's pretty centered.",00:18:20.840,00:18:25.210
"I see that there's something
has to be inverted.",00:18:25.210,00:18:27.530
"That's because the
method's implicit.",00:18:27.530,00:18:31.590
"If this was a matrix,
a system of equations,",00:18:31.590,00:18:34.330
"which is very typical -- could
be a large system of equations",00:18:34.330,00:18:39.360
"with a matrix, capital A. Then
u would be a vector and we would",00:18:39.360,00:18:46.230
"be solving this system: matrix
times vector equals known",00:18:46.230,00:18:52.750
right-hand side from time n.,00:18:52.750,00:18:55.650
"But here it's a scalar,
it's just a division,",00:18:55.650,00:18:59.580
"so what is stability
going to depend on?",00:18:59.580,00:19:03.700
What does stability require?,00:19:03.700,00:19:05.680
"At every step, we
don't want to grow.",00:19:05.680,00:19:08.960
"So if we take a step -- that's
1 plus a over 2 delta t divided",00:19:08.960,00:19:15.830
"by 1 minus a over 2 delta
t, that's the growth factor,",00:19:15.830,00:19:22.920
"the decay factor that multiplies
U_n to give you n plus 1,",00:19:22.920,00:19:28.730
"so the stability question is,
is this smaller or equal to 1?",00:19:28.730,00:19:34.600
"That's stability for
this trapezoidal method.",00:19:34.600,00:19:42.530
What's the story on that?,00:19:42.530,00:19:44.180
Suppose a is very negative.,00:19:44.180,00:19:48.580
"That's what killed
forward Euler, right?",00:19:48.580,00:19:51.880
"If a delta t -- that's where
we look for instability.",00:19:51.880,00:19:56.230
"If a delta t becomes
too negative,",00:19:56.230,00:20:01.660
"we lost stability
in forward Euler",00:20:01.660,00:20:06.700
"and we'll lose stability in
other, better methods too.",00:20:06.700,00:20:10.890
"But here, if a
delta t is negative,",00:20:10.890,00:20:16.850
that denominator is good.,00:20:16.850,00:20:18.680
"It's bigger than the
numerator, right?",00:20:18.680,00:20:23.790
So we have a -- you'll see it.,00:20:23.790,00:20:26.630
"If a delta t is less than 0,
if it's very much less than 0,",00:20:26.630,00:20:31.940
"then this is approaching maybe
minus 1, but it's below 1.",00:20:31.940,00:20:40.500
So this method is A-stable.,00:20:40.500,00:20:44.860
Absolutely stable.,00:20:44.860,00:20:46.730
Stable for all a less than 0.,00:20:46.730,00:20:52.530
We're fine.,00:20:52.530,00:20:55.140
"Delta t can be, in principle,
as large as we like.",00:20:55.140,00:21:00.800
"So we might ask, why
don't I just jump",00:21:00.800,00:21:03.990
"in one step to the time that
I want to reach and not bother",00:21:03.990,00:21:08.700
taking a lot of small steps?,00:21:08.700,00:21:10.640
"What's the -- in
that little paradox?",00:21:10.640,00:21:15.270
"It would be stable,
but what's no good?",00:21:15.270,00:21:20.750
"So if I jumped in
one giant step,",00:21:20.750,00:21:24.890
"this thing would be about
minus 1 or something.",00:21:24.890,00:21:27.630
"So u here would be
about minus 1 times u_0,",00:21:31.350,00:21:34.260
"and of course that's
not the answer.",00:21:34.260,00:21:37.810
"So why do we still
need a delta t?",00:21:37.810,00:21:44.030
"Because of the
discretization error.",00:21:44.030,00:21:47.410
"Because this isn't the
exact differential equation,",00:21:47.410,00:21:57.410
"so we still need -- we don't
have problem with stability,",00:21:57.410,00:22:02.640
"but we still have to get the
local errors down to whatever",00:22:02.640,00:22:11.310
level we want.,00:22:11.310,00:22:13.080
"Now what are those local
errors for this guy?",00:22:13.080,00:22:17.460
"What are the local
errors for that method?",00:22:17.460,00:22:25.030
Let's see.,00:22:25.030,00:22:25.530
Can we actually see it?,00:22:25.530,00:22:28.430
"I mean, you know what
I'm thinking, right?",00:22:28.430,00:22:31.480
"I'm thinking that
the local error",00:22:31.480,00:22:33.120
is of order delta t cubed.,00:22:33.120,00:22:36.840
"That's a second-order
method for me.",00:22:36.840,00:22:38.780
Delta t cubed at each step.,00:22:38.780,00:22:41.580
"1 over delta t steps, so
delta t squared overall,",00:22:41.580,00:22:45.550
and that's second order.,00:22:45.550,00:22:47.170
But do we see why this is?,00:22:47.170,00:22:49.780
"I mean, instinctively, we say,
it's centered, it should be.",00:22:49.780,00:22:53.510
"But let me expand
this to see, are we --",00:22:53.510,00:23:02.450
"is e to the a delta t --
how close is it to 1 --",00:23:02.450,00:23:08.740
"so it's approximately 1 plus
a over 2 delta t divided by 1",00:23:08.740,00:23:17.080
minus a half a delta t.,00:23:17.080,00:23:22.530
"I just want to see that sure
enough, this is second order.",00:23:22.530,00:23:26.370
"So of course, I have
a denominator here",00:23:26.370,00:23:28.900
that I want to multiply.,00:23:28.900,00:23:30.730
"So that's 1 plus a delta t
over 2, the explicit part,",00:23:30.730,00:23:35.340
"and then everybody
knows the 1 --",00:23:35.340,00:23:37.870
"there are only two series
to know, the truth is.",00:23:37.870,00:23:44.890
"We study infinite series
a lot, but the two",00:23:44.890,00:23:47.940
"that everybody needs to know
are the exponential series,",00:23:47.940,00:23:52.260
"which is for the left side,
and the geometric series,",00:23:52.260,00:23:58.150
"for the right side, 1
over 1 minus x is 1 plus x",00:23:58.150,00:24:05.570
plus x squared plus so on.,00:24:05.570,00:24:13.830
"So that's the -- this
came from the denominator,",00:24:16.980,00:24:20.450
"getting it up in the numerator
where I can multiply the other",00:24:20.450,00:24:24.180
"term and get 1 plus a
delta t, which is good",00:24:24.180,00:24:29.830
"and what's the coefficient
of a squared delta t squared?",00:24:29.830,00:24:33.630
Can you see what it is?,00:24:40.300,00:24:41.630
"If I do that multiplication,
what does -- you see it?",00:24:41.630,00:24:50.330
"Where do I get a delta
t squared from this?",00:24:50.330,00:24:54.980
"I get one here, times 1/4
and I get 1 here times 1/4,",00:24:54.980,00:25:00.850
"so that's 2/4, is 1/2.",00:25:00.850,00:25:02.200
"So it's great, right?",00:25:05.180,00:25:07.040
"It got the next term correct
in the exponential series.",00:25:07.040,00:25:12.470
"so that's why it's one
order higher, because it",00:25:12.470,00:25:15.230
"got the right number there, but
it won't get the right number",00:25:15.230,00:25:18.490
at the next step.,00:25:18.490,00:25:20.230
"What's the -- I'd have to
find out what the cube --",00:25:20.230,00:25:23.470
"this would be a delta t over
2 cubed, so what will it --",00:25:23.470,00:25:29.080
"the I'll get a wrong
coefficient for a delta t cubed.",00:25:29.080,00:25:33.620
"I'll get -- that would give
me 1/8 and this would give me",00:25:33.620,00:25:40.520
"another 1/8, I think, so I think
I'm getting two eighths out",00:25:40.520,00:25:43.790
of that.,00:25:43.790,00:25:44.290
"I'm getting 1/4, which is wrong.",00:25:44.290,00:25:47.290
What's right there?,00:25:47.290,00:25:49.660
"For the exponential
series, it should",00:25:49.660,00:25:52.850
be one over three factorial.,00:25:52.850,00:25:55.220
It should be 1/6.,00:25:55.220,00:25:56.820
"So I got 1/4, not
1/6, and the error",00:25:56.820,00:26:02.760
"is the difference between
them, which is 1/12.",00:26:02.760,00:26:05.900
So 1/12 would be this number.,00:26:05.900,00:26:10.130
"The local error, so
the local error DE",00:26:10.130,00:26:15.700
"would be like the missing 1/12,
the delta t to the third power",00:26:15.700,00:26:25.660
"now, and the third derivative.",00:26:25.660,00:26:29.310
"That's what would come out
if I patiently went through",00:26:32.340,00:26:39.030
"the estimate, just to
see, because we'll --",00:26:39.030,00:26:45.590
"in these weeks, we'll be
creating difference methods",00:26:45.590,00:26:49.990
"for partial differential
equations and we'll want",00:26:49.990,00:26:53.620
"to know, what's
controlling the error?",00:26:53.620,00:26:56.500
"This is the kind of calculation,
the beginning of a Taylor",00:26:56.500,00:27:00.660
"series that answers
that question.",00:27:00.660,00:27:03.370
"So the main point is, local
error delta t cubed, stable",00:27:03.370,00:27:09.890
for every a delta t.,00:27:09.890,00:27:12.550
"So our method would move from
Euler to trapezoidal and it",00:27:12.550,00:27:19.170
"would give us a final
error e -- sorry, small e.",00:27:19.170,00:27:25.810
I can say it without writing it.,00:27:25.810,00:27:27.680
"The error, small e, would
be delta t to -- what power?",00:27:27.680,00:27:32.740
"Squared, delta t squared.",00:27:32.740,00:27:34.680
Good.,00:27:34.680,00:27:36.690
"The same kind of reasoning
-- now I want to ask about --",00:27:36.690,00:27:42.700
"so that takes care
of trapezoidal,",00:27:42.700,00:27:45.660
which is a pretty good method.,00:27:45.660,00:27:47.980
"I think it's -- in MATLAB, it
would be ode something small t",00:27:47.980,00:27:56.090
for trapezoidal.,00:27:56.090,00:27:58.220
"Forgot -- maybe 1, 2.",00:27:58.220,00:27:59.670
I should know.,00:27:59.670,00:28:00.270
It's used quite a bit.,00:28:03.710,00:28:04.790
"Of course, we're going to
get higher than second order,",00:28:08.360,00:28:11.970
"but second order is often,
in computational mathematics,",00:28:11.970,00:28:16.730
a good balance.,00:28:16.730,00:28:18.310
"Newton's method for
solving nonlinear equation",00:28:18.310,00:28:21.720
"is second order and it
doesn't pay to go to higher.",00:28:21.720,00:28:25.130
"You could invent a -- you
could beat Newton by going,",00:28:25.130,00:28:30.700
"by inventing some third-order
method for solving a nonlinear",00:28:30.700,00:28:35.330
"equation, but in the end,
Newton would be the favorite.",00:28:35.330,00:28:41.240
"So second order is
pretty important.",00:28:41.240,00:28:43.600
"So let me point to --
so that was implicit,",00:28:46.130,00:28:52.220
"because it involved f_(n+1),
but Adams had another idea,",00:28:52.220,00:29:00.110

"Instead of implicit,
using f_(n+1),",00:29:04.250,00:29:08.170

f_(n-1), which we already know.",00:29:08.170,00:29:14.590
"We've already, at
that previous step,",00:29:14.590,00:29:17.640
substituted u_(n-1) into f.,00:29:17.640,00:29:23.520
"That might have
been time consuming,",00:29:23.520,00:29:25.180

it once and we only",00:29:25.180,00:29:28.130
have to do it once with Adams.,00:29:28.130,00:29:31.480

we already know.",00:29:31.480,00:29:33.690

we get explicitly the new u.",00:29:36.690,00:29:46.120

maintained high stability",00:30:37.450,00:30:43.470

one for importance, for use.",00:30:46.230,00:30:53.700
"So you're really seeing
three pretty good methods",00:30:53.700,00:30:56.850
that can be written down.,00:30:56.850,00:30:58.840
"So these numbers
were chosen to get",00:30:58.840,00:31:03.500
"that extra accuracy, which we
didn't get from backward Euler.",00:31:03.500,00:31:09.590
"When those numbers
were 1 and minus 1,",00:31:09.590,00:31:11.990
"backward Euler was
only first order.",00:31:11.990,00:31:15.080
"Now this goes up to second order
and you can guess that we can",00:31:15.080,00:31:23.890
"-- that every term
we allow ourselves,",00:31:23.890,00:31:27.250

coefficients well,",00:31:27.250,00:31:30.320
"so that the order
goes up by one more.",00:31:30.320,00:31:34.880
"Now if you looked at that,
you might say, why not keep --",00:31:34.880,00:31:45.150
you could come back to this.,00:31:45.150,00:31:47.870
"Why not combine the idea of
backward differences, more",00:31:47.870,00:31:52.170
"left-hand sides, with
the Adams-Bashforth idea",00:31:52.170,00:31:57.770
of more right-hand sides?,00:31:57.770,00:31:59.120
"Suppose I come back
to Adams-Bashforth",00:31:59.120,00:32:01.420

an 18.086 method.",00:32:01.420,00:32:06.020
"That'll be third order,
but still will only",00:32:06.020,00:32:09.660
go back one step.,00:32:09.660,00:32:11.090
"So it will somehow use
some combination like this,",00:32:11.090,00:32:15.160
"that goes back -- I'm not
writing this method down,",00:32:15.160,00:32:19.780
"for a good reason, of course,
but it will use something like",00:32:19.780,00:32:25.030
"this on the left side
and something like this",00:32:25.030,00:32:30.120
"on the right side and that
gives us enough freedom,",00:32:30.120,00:32:38.280
"enough coefficients to choose
-- two coefficients there,",00:32:38.280,00:32:41.340

that we can get third-order",00:32:41.340,00:32:46.780

"in the formula to get
that extra accuracy.",00:32:56.980,00:33:00.320
"So why isn't that the
most famous method of all?",00:33:00.320,00:33:04.740
"Why isn't that
even on the board?",00:33:04.740,00:33:08.430
You can guess.,00:33:08.430,00:33:10.230
"It's violently
unstable, so sadly,",00:33:10.230,00:33:15.410

"the numbers that show
up here are bad news.",00:33:27.630,00:33:32.030
"It's a fact of life and so
that's why we go backwards.",00:33:32.030,00:33:41.300
"We have to make a choice:
We go backwards with u,",00:33:41.300,00:33:46.210
"or Adams goes backwards with
f, or we think of something way",00:33:46.210,00:33:55.410
"to hype up the accuracy even
further within one step method.",00:33:55.410,00:34:02.020

the beginning of a table.",00:34:02.020,00:34:10.260
"People could figure out the
formulas for any order p,",00:34:10.260,00:34:16.230

give the beginning",00:34:16.230,00:34:18.480
"of a table for p equal 1,
which is Euler; p equal 2,",00:34:18.480,00:34:22.120

equal 3 and p equal 4,",00:34:22.120,00:34:25.270

"And those tables
show the constants.",00:34:32.970,00:34:39.200
"So they show the 1/12
or the 1/2 or whatever",00:34:39.200,00:34:42.680
"that is, and they show
the stability limit",00:34:42.680,00:34:48.880
"and of course, that's critical.",00:34:48.880,00:34:52.730
"The stability limit is much
better for backward differences",00:34:52.730,00:34:57.240
than it is for Adams-Bashforth.,00:34:57.240,00:34:59.260
"So actually, I only learned
recently that Adams-Bashforth,",00:34:59.260,00:35:06.410
"which we all teach, which all
books teach, I should say,",00:35:06.410,00:35:11.580
"isn't that much used way back --
maybe the astronomers might use",00:35:11.580,00:35:15.660
"it or they might use
backward differences,",00:35:15.660,00:35:19.600
which are more stable.,00:35:19.600,00:35:23.080
"So backward differences
has an important role",00:35:23.080,00:35:25.500
"and then one-step methods
will have an important role.",00:35:25.500,00:35:28.680
"Backward differences
are implicit,",00:35:28.680,00:35:31.490

-- you turn that way for stiff",00:35:31.490,00:35:37.010
"equations and for
nonstiff equations,",00:35:37.010,00:35:45.800
"let me show you what
the workhorse method is",00:35:45.800,00:35:48.810
in a moment.,00:35:48.810,00:35:51.000
"So I have a number 4 here,
whose name I better put up here.",00:35:51.000,00:35:57.680
"Let me put up the name
of method 4, which",00:35:57.680,00:36:01.890
is two names: Runge-Kutta.,00:36:01.890,00:36:05.200
"So that's a sort of
one compound step.",00:36:08.260,00:36:12.900
"So what do I mean by --
what's the point of --",00:36:19.700,00:36:24.090
"this looked pretty efficient,
but there are two aspects that",00:36:24.090,00:36:28.470
"we didn't really -- I
didn't really mention,",00:36:28.470,00:36:32.020
"and on those two aspects,
Runge-Kutta wins by being just",00:36:32.020,00:36:36.010
a single self-contained step.,00:36:36.010,00:36:39.330
"So what are the
drawbacks of a multistep",00:36:39.330,00:36:45.550
method like this or like this?,00:36:45.550,00:36:47.950
"You have to store the
old value, no problem,",00:36:51.840,00:36:55.970
"but at the beginning, at t
equals 0, what's the problem?",00:36:55.970,00:36:59.740
"You don't know the old value, so
you have to get started somehow",00:37:02.420,00:37:08.320
"with some separate -- you
can't use this at t equals 0,",00:37:08.320,00:37:12.600
"because it's calling for a
value at minus delta t and you",00:37:12.600,00:37:16.150
haven't got it.,00:37:16.150,00:37:18.030
"So you need -- it takes
a separate method.",00:37:18.030,00:37:21.580
"You can deal with that,
create -- use Runge-Kutta,",00:37:21.580,00:37:23.810
"for example, to get
that first step.",00:37:23.810,00:37:27.700
"But then there's another
problem with these backward step",00:37:27.700,00:37:30.670
"methods, which again,
can be resolved.",00:37:30.670,00:37:32.500
So this is a live method.,00:37:32.500,00:37:36.760
"The other problem is, if you
want to change delta t --",00:37:36.760,00:37:40.590
"suppose you want to
cut delta t in half,",00:37:40.590,00:37:43.760
"then this is looking for a
value that's a half delta t back",00:37:43.760,00:37:48.530
"in time and you haven't
got that either,",00:37:48.530,00:37:51.640
"but you've got values 1 delta
t back and 2 delta t back",00:37:51.640,00:37:56.760
"and some interpolation process
will produce that half value.",00:37:56.760,00:38:03.110
So what am I saying?,00:38:03.110,00:38:04.260
"I'm just saying
that getting started",00:38:04.260,00:38:08.170
"takes a special
attention, changing",00:38:08.170,00:38:11.730
"delta t takes a little
special attention,",00:38:11.730,00:38:14.060
"but still, it's all doable.",00:38:14.060,00:38:15.710
"So that this method, which I
gave a name to last time --",00:38:15.710,00:38:21.340
I've forgotten what it was.,00:38:21.340,00:38:23.270
"I think it was
something like ode15s",00:38:23.270,00:38:28.730
"for stiff is much used
for stiff equations.",00:38:28.730,00:38:40.150
"So now I'm left -- let
me not only write down",00:38:40.150,00:38:45.330
"Runge-Kutta's name,
but the other --",00:38:45.330,00:38:47.990
so multistep I've spoken about.,00:38:47.990,00:38:50.440
"I just -- this is -- I'm just
going to write this to remind",00:38:50.440,00:38:53.150
"myself to say one
word about it -- DAE.",00:38:53.150,00:38:59.890
Can I say one word even now?,00:39:03.750,00:39:05.460
I'm sorry.,00:39:05.460,00:39:06.370
Then I'll say one word later.,00:39:06.370,00:39:09.030
"So that's a differential
algebraic equation.",00:39:09.030,00:39:14.570
"That's like a situation
which comes up",00:39:14.570,00:39:16.870
"in chemical engineering and
many other places, in which,",00:39:16.870,00:39:21.400
"out of our n given
equations, some of them",00:39:21.400,00:39:26.990
"are differential
equations, but others",00:39:26.990,00:39:29.330
"are ordinary algebra equations,
so there's no d by dt in them.",00:39:29.330,00:39:38.270
"Nevertheless, we have to
solve, and there is a d by dt",00:39:38.270,00:39:41.850
in the others.,00:39:41.850,00:39:43.270
"So this is a whole
little world of DAEs,",00:39:43.270,00:39:46.950
which you may never meet.,00:39:46.950,00:39:48.400
I have never personally met.,00:39:48.400,00:39:51.940
"But it has to be dealt
with and there are codes --",00:39:51.940,00:39:57.350
"I'll just mention the
code DASSL by Petzold --",00:39:57.350,00:40:03.900
I'll finish saying the one word.,00:40:03.900,00:40:05.830
"A model problem here
would be some matrix times",00:40:05.830,00:40:13.130
"u prime equal f of u and t, so
a sort of implicit differential",00:40:13.130,00:40:23.460
"equation, because I'm
not given u prime,",00:40:23.460,00:40:25.740
I'm only given M u prime.,00:40:25.740,00:40:28.700
"If M is singular -- otherwise
I could multiply by M inverse",00:40:28.700,00:40:35.310
"and make it totally normal,
but if M, at some times t --",00:40:35.310,00:40:42.040
"or M may depend on u and
t -- it could go singular.",00:40:42.040,00:40:48.430
"If it goes singular, then
this system is degenerating",00:40:48.430,00:40:51.800
and we have to think what to do.,00:40:51.800,00:40:53.650
"And this DASSL code would be
one of the good ones that does.",00:40:53.650,00:41:00.200
"So that's sort of like
my memory to myself",00:41:00.200,00:41:03.240
"to say something about
DAEs before completing",00:41:03.240,00:41:08.890
"this topic of ordinary
differential equations.",00:41:08.890,00:41:12.320
Now for Runge-Kutta.,00:41:12.320,00:41:14.450
Let me take p equal to 2 first.,00:41:14.450,00:41:18.130
"The famous Runge-Kutta
is the one at p equal --",00:41:18.130,00:41:22.130
with forth order accuracy.,00:41:22.130,00:41:23.430
"That will take more of the
little internal compounded",00:41:29.000,00:41:35.990
"steps than p equal
to 2 takes, but p",00:41:35.990,00:41:39.395
equal to 2 makes the point.,00:41:39.395,00:41:41.070
"So this'll be simplified
Runge-Kutta -- p equal to 2.",00:41:45.300,00:41:49.980
"It'll be U_(n+1) minus U_n --
you see, it's just one step,",00:41:49.980,00:41:59.990
but what goes here?,00:41:59.990,00:42:01.830
Do I remember?,00:42:05.250,00:42:06.260
The notes will tell me.,00:42:06.260,00:42:07.930
"I better -- since it's
going to be kept forever,",00:42:07.930,00:42:12.230
I better get it right.,00:42:12.230,00:42:14.890
"It involves f_n and f of f,
so Runge-Kutta, here we go.",00:42:14.890,00:42:25.770
"It has a half of f_n, the usual
Euler figure out this slope.",00:42:25.770,00:42:35.110
"But then, the other half is
the same f at -- I take Euler,",00:42:35.110,00:42:44.800
"so doing this part allowed me
to take a forward Euler step,",00:42:44.800,00:42:49.800
"and now I put that forward Euler
step in as like a U_(n+1) delta",00:42:49.800,00:42:58.730
"t f_n at time --
what's the right time?",00:42:58.730,00:43:04.830
"Probably -- that's sort of
-- this is like u_(n+1),",00:43:04.830,00:43:12.020
"but we didn't have to do --
we're not implicit and so I",00:43:12.020,00:43:16.620
"presume that that's
at time n plus 1.",00:43:16.620,00:43:19.050
"So I've written in one
line what the code would",00:43:23.590,00:43:27.800
have to write in two lines.,00:43:27.800,00:43:30.020
"The first line of code would
be compute f at the old U_n,",00:43:30.020,00:43:38.590
"then take an Euler step,
multiply it by delta t and add",00:43:38.590,00:43:44.400
"to U_n, so this gives
something that's like U_(n+1),",00:43:44.400,00:43:50.000
but didn't cost us anything.,00:43:50.000,00:43:55.420
"So can you compare
that with trapezoidal?",00:43:55.420,00:43:58.460
"You see, the comparison with
trapezoidal is trapezoidal has",00:44:01.330,00:44:05.780
"the 1/2 f_n, the same, but it
has the 1/2 f_(n+1) at the new",00:44:05.780,00:44:12.340
"step, involving the new U_(n+1),
where this one is something",00:44:12.340,00:44:19.620
"like it, but something we
already knew from Euler.",00:44:19.620,00:44:23.600
So that's the natural idea.,00:44:23.600,00:44:27.120
"All these ideas actually
would occur to all of us,",00:44:27.120,00:44:30.190
"if we started thinking
about these for a few weeks.",00:44:30.190,00:44:35.440
"But, I guess I'm not planning
to spend a few weeks on that,",00:44:35.440,00:44:39.820
"so I'm just jumping ahead to
what people have thought of.",00:44:39.820,00:44:46.610
"So that's, you could
say, two-step Euler.",00:44:46.610,00:44:51.680
"There's two evaluations
of f within a step.",00:44:51.680,00:44:58.700
So what's p equal 4?,00:44:58.700,00:45:00.130
"The famous Runge-Kutta
is four of those.",00:45:00.130,00:45:04.670
"So you take --
there's an Euler step.",00:45:04.670,00:45:06.500
That'll be step one.,00:45:06.500,00:45:08.300
"Then you'll stick that into
something, at step n plus 1/2.",00:45:08.300,00:45:13.890
"That'll be a second
evaluation of f.",00:45:13.890,00:45:16.430
That'll give you some output.,00:45:16.430,00:45:18.450
"You plug that in and
that will actually,",00:45:18.450,00:45:22.480
"if it's correctly chosen, be
another, better approximation",00:45:22.480,00:45:25.770
"at 1/2, at n plus 1/2.",00:45:25.770,00:45:28.440
"You put that into
the fourth one,",00:45:28.440,00:45:30.040
"which will give you something
close to U_(n+1) and then you",00:45:30.040,00:45:34.180
take the right weights.,00:45:34.180,00:45:35.900
Here they were 1/2 and 1/2.,00:45:35.900,00:45:37.090
"Anyway, you can do it.",00:45:39.890,00:45:42.330
"The algebra begins to get
messy beyond p equal 4,",00:45:42.330,00:45:46.150
but you can go beyond p equal 4.,00:45:46.150,00:45:48.730
"I mean, there's books
on Runge-Kutta methods",00:45:48.730,00:45:53.180
"because the algebra gets
-- of these f of f of f.",00:45:53.180,00:45:56.470
"If there's anything that -- any
construction in math that looks",00:45:56.470,00:46:02.330
"so easy, just take f of f
of f of f of a function,",00:46:02.330,00:46:09.080
of a number.,00:46:09.080,00:46:11.640
"That seems so simple, but
actually it's extremely hard",00:46:11.640,00:46:14.510
to understand what happens.,00:46:14.510,00:46:16.490
"Maybe you know that Mandelbrot's
fractal sets and all",00:46:16.490,00:46:22.430
"these problems of chaos
come exactly that way",00:46:22.430,00:46:25.410
"and they're extremely hard
to see what's happening.",00:46:25.410,00:46:29.940
"When you do repeated
composition,",00:46:29.940,00:46:34.380
you would call that f of f of f.,00:46:34.380,00:46:37.760
"So Runge-Kutta stops
at 4 and then there",00:46:37.760,00:46:43.740
"is actually an
implicit Runge-Kutta",00:46:43.740,00:46:46.640
"that people work
on, but I don't dare",00:46:46.640,00:46:48.655
"to begin to write that
down and I won't even",00:46:48.655,00:46:50.910
"write the details of that
one, which are in our notes",00:46:50.910,00:46:54.250
and in every set of notes.,00:46:54.250,00:46:57.100
But what's the point?,00:46:57.100,00:46:58.370
"First, we get the
accuracy, so what's",00:47:01.920,00:47:04.420
"the other thing you
have to ask about?",00:47:04.420,00:47:07.120
Stability.,00:47:07.120,00:47:09.390
"So what does our
stability calculation",00:47:09.390,00:47:11.940
give for Runge-Kutta?,00:47:11.940,00:47:15.740
"The thing that you
have to work with,",00:47:18.960,00:47:20.590
"actually, turns out
to be quite nice.",00:47:20.590,00:47:23.150
"It's just the series for
e to the a*t chopped off",00:47:23.150,00:47:30.010
"at the power, however
far you're going.",00:47:30.010,00:47:33.330
"So this is Runge-Kutta
stability, p equal to 2.",00:47:33.330,00:47:44.480
"The growth factor
will be from --",00:47:44.480,00:47:48.990
"if I just do this and I take
the model problem, f equal a*u,",00:47:48.990,00:47:56.140
"you could -- if I took
that out of there,",00:47:56.140,00:47:59.230
"the growth factor will be 1 plus
a delta t plus 1/2 a delta t",00:47:59.230,00:48:06.540
squared.,00:48:06.540,00:48:09.210
Stop.,00:48:09.210,00:48:09.710
"That's what this would
give, for the model problem,",00:48:13.540,00:48:17.160
"as the growth factor that
multiplies each U to get",00:48:17.160,00:48:19.990
"the next U. What p equal 4 would
give would be the same thing",00:48:19.990,00:48:30.420
"plus -- it's just the right
-- it's just the exponential",00:48:30.420,00:48:35.150
"series chopped off
at the fourth term.",00:48:35.150,00:48:43.370
"So of course, you
see immediately,",00:48:43.370,00:48:45.220
what's the discretization error?,00:48:45.220,00:48:47.840
It's delta t of the fifth.,00:48:47.840,00:48:49.420
"It's the first missing term
that Runge-Kutta didn't capture,",00:48:49.420,00:48:57.640
"multiplied by 1
over 5 factorial,",00:48:57.640,00:48:59.880
"so you know right away that
the constant is 1 over 120,",00:48:59.880,00:49:03.740
which is pretty good.,00:49:03.740,00:49:07.280
"But the question
is the stability.",00:49:07.280,00:49:10.070
So what do we want to know here?,00:49:10.070,00:49:12.730
"We want to know -- so let
me let a delta t be some --",00:49:12.730,00:49:18.170
"because that same number is
coming up -- let me call it z,",00:49:18.170,00:49:21.020
right?,00:49:21.020,00:49:21.810
"So the stability test,
for p equal to 2,",00:49:21.810,00:49:26.790
"is to look at the
magnitude of 1 plus z",00:49:26.790,00:49:31.540
"plus 1/2 z squared and we
want it to be less than",00:49:31.540,00:49:35.925
or equal to 1.,00:49:35.925,00:49:43.370
"Now, the point is,
this is something --",00:49:43.370,00:49:47.360
"I hope you try
this this weekend.",00:49:47.360,00:49:50.530
"Somehow get MATLAB to plot,
in the complex plane --",00:49:50.530,00:49:54.440
"see you really -- up there now
we've just -- at some point z,",00:49:54.440,00:50:00.990
"some negative value of z -- it's
going to hit 1 and then after",00:50:00.990,00:50:05.770
"that, it's going to be unstable.",00:50:05.770,00:50:11.040
"Of course, there's got to be
a point where it's unstable.",00:50:11.040,00:50:13.750
This is an explicit method.,00:50:13.750,00:50:16.420
Runge-Kutta is explicit.,00:50:16.420,00:50:19.860
"So it can't -- if the
problem is too stiff,",00:50:19.860,00:50:22.820
"we're going to be killed, but
if it's an ordinary problem,",00:50:22.820,00:50:27.410
this is a winner.,00:50:27.410,00:50:28.880
"So p equal 4, this is the
code ode45, which uses --",00:50:28.880,00:50:35.030
"combines Runge-Kutta with 4 on
a higher-order formula to get",00:50:35.030,00:50:41.960
"an estimate for the
error in that step.",00:50:41.960,00:50:47.770
"So I could make some comment
on predictor-corrector methods,",00:50:47.770,00:50:51.540
"but I'll leave
that in the notes.",00:50:51.540,00:50:54.100
"So, what does that
region look like?",00:50:54.100,00:51:02.430
"And then, the other one is, what
does the region 1 plus the z",00:51:02.430,00:51:07.115
"plus 1/2 z squared plus
1/6 z cubed plus 1/24 z",00:51:07.115,00:51:12.820
"to the fourth,
less or equal 1 --",00:51:12.820,00:51:15.430
what's that region look like?,00:51:15.430,00:51:18.760
"I mean, if those regions
are small, the method loses.",00:51:18.760,00:51:24.680
"If those regions
are bigger than we",00:51:24.680,00:51:27.940
"get from Adams-Bashforth
or backward differences,",00:51:27.940,00:51:30.830
"then the methods in there
are good, successful.",00:51:30.830,00:51:38.240
"I've forgotten exactly what
the picture is like there.",00:51:38.240,00:51:43.260
Why am I in the complex plane?,00:51:43.260,00:51:45.000
"Because the number
a -- z is a delta t.",00:51:45.000,00:51:50.430
That number a can be complex.,00:51:50.430,00:51:53.050
How can it be complex?,00:51:53.050,00:51:56.110
"I'm not really thinking that
our model equation u prime equal",00:51:56.110,00:51:59.860
"a*u will be complex, but our
model system would be u prime",00:51:59.860,00:52:05.400
"equals a matrix times u and then
it's the eigenvalues of that",00:52:05.400,00:52:11.270
"matrix that take the
place of little a.",00:52:11.270,00:52:18.010
"So we have n different
little a's going for a system",00:52:18.010,00:52:21.860
"and the eigenvalues of a totally
real matrix can be nonreal,",00:52:21.860,00:52:28.330
can be complex numbers.,00:52:28.330,00:52:30.220
"Let's just think when that
happens and then I'll --",00:52:30.220,00:52:35.797
what does the figure looks like?,00:52:35.797,00:52:37.130
"For p equals 4, I sort of
remember that the figure even",00:52:37.130,00:52:41.010
"captures a little bit of that
plane and then it goes --",00:52:41.010,00:52:46.010
"why should I mess
up the board with --",00:52:46.010,00:52:52.570
it's a pretty good-sized region.,00:52:52.570,00:52:54.440
"It's probably not
shaped like that at all,",00:52:54.440,00:52:59.390
"but the point is, maybe
this reaches out to about e,",00:52:59.390,00:53:04.810
minus e.,00:53:04.810,00:53:05.410
"I think it does,
somewhere around --",00:53:05.410,00:53:06.910
"I don't know if that's
an accurate -- right,",00:53:06.910,00:53:09.210
"reaches out around minus --
and reaches up to around 2.",00:53:09.210,00:53:15.780
"So in this last second, I
was just going to say --",00:53:15.780,00:53:18.960
"and we'll see it plenty of times
-- where do we get complex --",00:53:18.960,00:53:23.640
"where do we get nice,
real, big systems,",00:53:23.640,00:53:27.640
"stiff systems with complex
eigenvalues in real",00:53:27.640,00:53:33.430

"By real calculations,
I really mean PDEs.",00:53:36.360,00:53:40.560
"So in a partial
differential equation --",00:53:40.560,00:53:43.630
"so this is just a throw-away
comment that we'll deal with",00:53:43.630,00:53:48.130
"again -- in partial
differential equations,",00:53:48.130,00:53:51.230
"a u_(x,x) term or a u_(y,y)
term -- that get multiplied,",00:53:51.230,00:53:58.920
"typically, by diffusion,
those are diffusion terms --",00:53:58.920,00:54:05.310
"those produce symmetric things,
symmetric negative definite.",00:54:05.310,00:54:10.790
"But convection, advection
terms, velocity terms that get",00:54:10.790,00:54:17.120
"multiplied by some -- that
are first derivatives --",00:54:17.120,00:54:21.960
"those produce -- those
are antisymmetric.",00:54:21.960,00:54:25.890
"Those produce these
complex eigenvalues",00:54:25.890,00:54:28.620
that we have to deal with.,00:54:28.620,00:54:30.630
"So, everybody wants to
solve convection-diffusion.",00:54:30.630,00:54:36.480
"Convection has these
terms, diffusion has these.",00:54:36.480,00:54:40.170
"The coefficient
may be very small.",00:54:40.170,00:54:42.770
"The hard -- that's
the hard case,",00:54:42.770,00:54:44.470
when the convection is serious.,00:54:44.470,00:54:47.530

the imaginary axis,",00:54:47.530,00:54:50.970

us to the left",00:54:50.970,00:54:54.370

time thinking of good methods",00:54:54.370,00:54:58.740
for that.,00:54:58.740,00:55:00.350
