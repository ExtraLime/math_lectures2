"ANA RITA PIRES:
In lecture, you've",00:00:06.454,00:00:07.870
"learned about Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization,",00:00:07.870,00:00:10.260
"and that's what today's
problem is about.",00:00:10.260,00:00:12.600
"We have a matrix A, and its
columns are a, b, and c.",00:00:12.600,00:00:17.790
"And I want you to find
orthonormal vectors",00:00:17.790,00:00:21.000
"q_1, q_2, and q_3 from
those three columns.",00:00:21.000,00:00:24.360
"Then I want you to write A
as a-- it's QR decomposition",00:00:24.360,00:00:28.890
"where Q is an orthogonal matrix,
and R is an upper triangular",00:00:28.890,00:00:32.240
matrix.,00:00:32.240,00:00:33.270
"Remember, an orthogonal matrix
is a matrix whose columns",00:00:33.270,00:00:36.730
are orthonormal vectors.,00:00:36.730,00:00:39.480
"Work on it for a
little while, hit",00:00:39.480,00:00:41.169
"pause, and when you're
ready I'll come back",00:00:41.169,00:00:42.960
and we'll do it together.,00:00:42.960,00:00:44.001
"Did you manage to
solve that all right?",00:00:52.170,00:00:55.160
"Well let's start
solving it together.",00:00:55.160,00:00:58.490
"So Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization,",00:00:58.490,00:01:00.850
"as you should
remember from lecture,",00:01:00.850,00:01:04.250
consists of the following.,00:01:04.250,00:01:06.210
"At each step, you find
your orthonormal vector",00:01:06.210,00:01:10.540
"by taking the vector that
you started with, a, b, or c",00:01:10.540,00:01:15.000
"in this case, and
making it orthonormal",00:01:15.000,00:01:18.420
to the previous ones.,00:01:18.420,00:01:22.430
Let's actually do it.,00:01:22.430,00:01:25.780
We want to find q_1.,00:01:25.780,00:01:27.920
"Well, to find q_1,
start with a, and make",00:01:27.920,00:01:30.780
"it orthonormal to
the previous one.",00:01:30.780,00:01:32.890
"There's no previous one,
so that's very easy.",00:01:32.890,00:01:35.020
"The direction of a
is fine and you just",00:01:35.020,00:01:37.390
"need to ensure that your
vector has length 1.",00:01:37.390,00:01:40.950
"Well, a is the vector [1, 0, 0].",00:01:40.950,00:01:44.790
"So you should divide
it by its length,",00:01:44.790,00:01:46.520
"but its length is 1, so
this is simply [1, 0, 0].",00:01:46.520,00:01:54.240
q_1 is done.,00:01:54.240,00:01:55.280
Now let's do q_2.,00:01:55.280,00:01:56.360
"So with q_2, I will
start with my vector b.",00:01:59.000,00:02:03.560
"And then I want to
make it, well first",00:02:03.560,00:02:05.520
"of all, orthogonal to what I
already have, which is q_1.",00:02:05.520,00:02:09.210
"For that, I'm going to subtract
off from b the projection of b",00:02:09.210,00:02:14.070
onto q_1.,00:02:14.070,00:02:16.290
Minus b dot q_1 times q_1.,00:02:16.290,00:02:21.970
"Usually, when you're doing the
projection of a vector onto",00:02:21.970,00:02:25.010
"another vector, you have
to divide it by the length",00:02:25.010,00:02:27.630
"of, in this case, q1_.",00:02:27.630,00:02:29.600
"But because q_1 has length
1, you don't need to do that.",00:02:29.600,00:02:34.700
So what will it be here?,00:02:34.700,00:02:36.260
"Well b dot q_1 is going
to be-- b is [2, 0, 3],",00:02:36.260,00:02:46.770
"minus, b dot q_1 will
be 2, and [1, 0, 0].",00:02:46.770,00:02:53.360
"So this will be [0, 0, 3].",00:02:53.360,00:02:59.870
"This vector is
orthogonal to this one,",00:02:59.870,00:03:02.320
"and you can check by
doing your dot product.",00:03:02.320,00:03:04.440
"It should be 0, and it is.",00:03:04.440,00:03:07.250
"We need it also to be length
1, because we want these two",00:03:07.250,00:03:11.780
vectors to be orthonormal.,00:03:11.780,00:03:13.920
So this is not actually q_2.,00:03:13.920,00:03:15.810
"Let's call this one
q_2 prime, and set q_2",00:03:15.810,00:03:20.200
"equals to q_2 prime divided by
its length, which in this case",00:03:20.200,00:03:25.520
is 3.,00:03:25.520,00:03:26.755
"[0, 0, 1].",00:03:29.580,00:03:32.890
That's my vector q_2.,00:03:32.890,00:03:35.140
"Let's go on to the
third one, q_3.",00:03:35.140,00:03:40.960
"Well again, I start
with my third vector, c.",00:03:40.960,00:03:45.220
"And then I want to subtract
the projection of c",00:03:45.220,00:03:49.370
"onto q_1 and onto q_2,
and that will give me",00:03:49.370,00:03:52.620
"a q_3 that is orthogonal
to both q_1 and q_2.",00:03:52.620,00:03:56.830
"c minus c dot q_1 times q_1
minus c dot q_2 dot q_2.",00:03:56.830,00:04:09.270
"This will be c, [4, 5, 6]
minus, q_1 was [1 0 0],",00:04:09.270,00:04:17.910
"so 4, times [1, 0, 0],
minus-- q2-- 6 [0, 0, 1].",00:04:17.910,00:04:28.590
"So this vector
will be [0, 5,  0].",00:04:28.590,00:04:34.930
"And once again, this one is
orthogonal to q_1 and q_2,",00:04:34.930,00:04:39.990
but it is not norm 1 yet.,00:04:39.990,00:04:42.270
"So q_3-- I'll call
that one q_3 prime,",00:04:42.270,00:04:47.350
"and I'll set q_3 equal
to q_3 prime divided",00:04:47.350,00:04:51.630
by its length which is 5.,00:04:51.630,00:04:55.770
"q_3 is the vector [0, 1, 0].",00:04:55.770,00:04:59.480
"One thing that I
want you to note",00:05:04.310,00:05:05.720
"is that my vectors q_1, q_2,
q_3 are very nice in this case.",00:05:05.720,00:05:10.410
"Usually, when you perform
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization,",00:05:10.410,00:05:13.230
"you end up with
lots of square roots",00:05:13.230,00:05:14.930
"because you're
dividing by the length.",00:05:14.930,00:05:17.100
"In this case, we have
everything is integers,",00:05:17.100,00:05:22.190
"which is, well, very lucky.",00:05:22.190,00:05:25.550
"Next part of the problem
is we want to write the QR",00:05:25.550,00:05:28.440
"decomposition of the matrix A. A
equals Q*R. Well, the matrix A,",00:05:28.440,00:05:37.210
you already know what it is.,00:05:37.210,00:05:38.660
"It is the matrix
[1, 2, 4; 0, 0,  5; 0, 3, 6].",00:05:38.660,00:05:50.450
"And Q you want to be
an orthogonal matrix.",00:05:50.450,00:05:54.620
"Like I said before,
an orthogonal matrix",00:05:54.620,00:05:56.680
"has orthonormal vectors
for its columns.",00:05:56.680,00:06:00.130
"And we already
have such a matrix.",00:06:00.130,00:06:02.590
"It's the matrix that has q_1,
q_2, and q_3 as its column",00:06:02.590,00:06:06.160
vectors.,00:06:06.160,00:06:07.640
"1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1; and 0, 1, 0.",00:06:07.640,00:06:15.250
"Now, we need an upper
triangular matrix",00:06:15.250,00:06:18.400
that makes this equality true.,00:06:18.400,00:06:21.450
"Take a moment to
look at your matrix",00:06:21.450,00:06:23.120
"Q. It is simply a
permutation matrix,",00:06:23.120,00:06:27.020
"so it's very easy to come
up with a matrix that",00:06:27.020,00:06:29.290
should fit here.,00:06:29.290,00:06:30.850
"What this permutation
matrix does is it",00:06:30.850,00:06:34.220
"exchanges rows two and three
from my matrix R to give you A.",00:06:34.220,00:06:39.310
So you know what R must be.,00:06:39.310,00:06:40.970
"It must be 1, 2, 4; 0, 3, 6--
that's the third row of A--",00:06:40.970,00:06:47.910
"and then 0, 0, 5, which
is the second row of A.",00:06:47.910,00:06:52.420
"And indeed, R is
upper triangular.",00:06:52.420,00:06:56.420
"This is your QR decomposition of
the matrix A. Q is orthogonal,",00:06:56.420,00:07:00.810
R is upper triangular.,00:07:00.810,00:07:04.059
"But let's see where these
numbers in the matrix R",00:07:04.059,00:07:06.100
are coming from.,00:07:06.100,00:07:08.360
"Let me label these columns for
you, a, b, c and q_1, q_2, q_3.",00:07:08.360,00:07:15.990
And then I have my matrix R.,00:07:15.990,00:07:18.385
"You know from the way that
matrix multiplication works",00:07:18.385,00:07:21.900
"that A is going
to be this matrix",00:07:21.900,00:07:27.800
"Q times the first
column of R. So you",00:07:27.800,00:07:30.906
"can regard that as these
numbers in the first column of R",00:07:30.906,00:07:34.370
"are giving you the linear
coefficients in which you",00:07:34.370,00:07:37.400
"need to take these
vectors to add up",00:07:37.400,00:07:40.730
to A. Let me write that down.,00:07:40.730,00:07:43.130
"A is going to be 1 times q_1
plus 0 times q_2 plus 0 times",00:07:43.130,00:07:50.550
q_3.,00:07:50.550,00:07:51.980
Let's do it for b.,00:07:51.980,00:07:53.380
"The second column of this matrix
will be Q times this column.",00:07:53.380,00:07:57.740
"So it will be 2 times q_1 plus
3 times q_2 plus 0 times q_3.",00:07:57.740,00:08:08.140
"And finally, for c I will have
c is equal to this matrix times",00:08:08.140,00:08:14.500
"this vector, 4*q_1
plus 6*q_2 plus 5*q_3.",00:08:14.500,00:08:23.910
"Now let's go back and see where
these numbers are showing up.",00:08:23.910,00:08:26.800
"I wanted to have A
equals 1 times q_1.",00:08:30.100,00:08:34.320
Well that's very easy.,00:08:34.320,00:08:35.340
"It comes from here,
a equals 1 times q_1.",00:08:35.340,00:08:39.039
Let's try the second one.,00:08:42.830,00:08:44.320
b equals 2*q_1 plus 3*q_2.,00:08:44.320,00:08:49.640
"Well q_2, let's see.",00:08:49.640,00:08:52.650
"q_2 prime is equal
to 3 times q_2,",00:08:52.650,00:08:54.960
"so let me write
this here to help.",00:08:54.960,00:08:57.430
3*q_2.,00:08:57.430,00:08:59.900
"Now let me remind you that
b dot q_1 was equal to 2.",00:08:59.900,00:09:05.460
Now look at this equation.,00:09:05.460,00:09:06.600
"You we have b is equal
to 2*q_1 plus 3*q_2,",00:09:06.600,00:09:12.690
which is what we wanted.,00:09:12.690,00:09:14.570
Let's check q_3.,00:09:14.570,00:09:15.680
"q_3 prime is equal to 5*q_3 so
let me write that here, 5*q_3.",00:09:18.720,00:09:25.450
"And now I have c is equal
to-- this number was 4,",00:09:25.450,00:09:32.545
"and this number was 6-- c is
equal to 4*q_1 plus 6*q_2 plus",00:09:32.545,00:09:40.320
"5*q_3, which indeed,
is what we wanted.",00:09:40.320,00:09:45.250
"So this is where these
numbers from the matrix R",00:09:45.250,00:09:47.280
are coming from.,00:09:47.280,00:09:49.780
And that finishes this problem.,00:09:49.780,00:09:52.380
"I hope you have a better grasp
of the QR decomposition now.",00:09:52.380,00:09:56.920
Bye.,00:09:56.920,00:09:57.420
See you next time.,00:09:57.420,00:09:59.414
