"Conditional probabilities are
like ordinary probabilities,",00:00:01.940,00:00:05.900
"except that they apply to a
new situation where some",00:00:05.900,00:00:08.680
"additional information
is available.",00:00:08.680,00:00:11.210
"For this reason, any concept
relevant to probability models",00:00:11.210,00:00:14.850
"has a counterpart
that applies to",00:00:14.850,00:00:17.520
conditional probability models.,00:00:17.520,00:00:20.050
"In this spirit, we can define
a notion of conditional",00:00:20.050,00:00:23.230
"independence, which is nothing
but the notion of independence",00:00:23.230,00:00:27.440
"applied to a conditional
model.",00:00:27.440,00:00:29.840
Let us be more specific.,00:00:29.840,00:00:31.720
"Suppose that we have a
probability model and two",00:00:31.720,00:00:34.590
"events, A and B. We are then
told that event C occurred,",00:00:34.590,00:00:42.190
"and we construct a conditional
model.",00:00:42.190,00:00:44.690
"Conditional independence
is defined as ordinary",00:00:44.690,00:00:47.250
"independence but with respect
to the conditional",00:00:47.250,00:00:50.100
probabilities.,00:00:50.100,00:00:51.430
"To be more precise, remember
that independence is defined",00:00:51.430,00:00:56.420
"in terms of this relation, that
the probability of two",00:00:56.420,00:00:59.710
"events happening is the product
of the probabilities",00:00:59.710,00:01:03.840
"that one of them is happening
times the probability that the",00:01:03.840,00:01:07.780
other one is happening.,00:01:07.780,00:01:10.890
"This is the definition of
independence in the original",00:01:10.890,00:01:15.240
unconditional model.,00:01:15.240,00:01:17.350
"Now, in the conditional model we
just use the same relation,",00:01:17.350,00:01:21.950
"but with conditional
probabilities instead of",00:01:21.950,00:01:26.960
ordinary probabilities.,00:01:26.960,00:01:29.050
"So this is the definition of
conditional independence.",00:01:29.050,00:01:34.190
"We may now ask, is there a
relation between independence",00:01:34.190,00:01:38.170
and conditional independence?,00:01:38.170,00:01:40.100
Does one imply the other?,00:01:40.100,00:01:42.120
Let us look at an example.,00:01:42.120,00:01:44.789
"Suppose that we have two events
and these two events",00:01:44.789,00:01:48.160
are independent.,00:01:48.160,00:01:50.320
"We then condition on another
event, C. And suppose that the",00:01:50.320,00:01:54.440
"picture is like the
one shown here.",00:01:54.440,00:01:59.220
"Are A and B conditionally
independent?",00:01:59.220,00:02:02.620
"Well, in the new universe where
C has happened, events A",00:02:05.460,00:02:10.850
and B have no intersection.,00:02:10.850,00:02:13.860
"As we discussed earlier this
means that events A and B are",00:02:13.860,00:02:17.290
extremely dependent.,00:02:17.290,00:02:19.180
"Within G, if A occurs, this
tells us that B did not occur.",00:02:19.180,00:02:27.240
"The conclusion from this example
is that independence",00:02:27.240,00:02:31.440
"does not imply conditional
independence.",00:02:31.440,00:02:35.090
"So in this particular example,
we saw that the",00:02:35.090,00:02:38.090
answer here is no.,00:02:38.090,00:02:40.160
"Given C, A and B are
not independent.",00:02:40.160,00:02:43.070
