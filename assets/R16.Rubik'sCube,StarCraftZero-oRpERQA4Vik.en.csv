So who's going lecture?,00:00:21.490,00:00:25.020
Good.,00:00:25.020,00:00:27.290
Does everything makes sense?,00:00:27.290,00:00:29.905

to talk about is, first,",00:00:34.460,00:00:37.240
"there's a subtlety in the
Rubik's cube problem, which I'm",00:00:37.240,00:00:39.750
"guessing nobody has seen yet,
but we're going to talk about",00:00:39.750,00:00:42.462
"it anyway, because otherwise
you'll trip on it while you're",00:00:42.462,00:00:44.920
doing the problem.,00:00:44.920,00:00:46.340

"AUDIENCE: I'm curious, did you
write this week's problem set?",00:00:57.960,00:01:00.600

Chinese in there.",00:01:00.600,00:01:02.630

"AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.",00:01:03.260,00:01:03.968
"PROFESSOR: No,
someone else wrote it.",00:01:03.968,00:01:06.580

that in there, though.",00:01:06.580,00:01:08.675

awesome internship, right?",00:01:11.675,00:01:13.857

the AMD [INAUDIBLE] questions?",00:01:14.811,00:01:17.767
PROFESSOR:Of course.,00:01:17.767,00:01:18.600
That's my stuff.,00:01:18.600,00:01:19.266
OK.,00:01:22.531,00:01:23.030
So Rubik's cubes.,00:01:23.030,00:01:25.280
"Did everyone see a 2
by 2 by 2 Rubik's cube?",00:01:25.280,00:01:27.319
"You guys are going
to lecture, right?",00:01:27.319,00:01:28.860
You have one.,00:01:28.860,00:01:29.700
Yeah.,00:01:29.700,00:01:31.240
"Did you guys see Eric's
2 by 2 by 2 Rubik's cube?",00:01:31.240,00:01:34.210
It looks sort of like this.,00:01:36.830,00:01:37.960
"All right, so big
Rubik's cube has how many",00:01:48.140,00:01:51.230
small cubelets in it?,00:01:51.230,00:01:53.319
AUDIENCE: 80.,00:01:53.319,00:01:53.860
AUDIENCE: 80.,00:01:53.860,00:01:55.820
"AUDIENCE: I like cubelets
better than cubies.",00:01:55.820,00:01:58.270
Cubies is hard to say.,00:01:58.270,00:01:59.687
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
would say cubicles.",00:01:59.687,00:02:01.270
"So let's go for--
let's try cubelets",00:02:01.270,00:02:03.260
and see how this works.,00:02:03.260,00:02:05.410
OK.,00:02:05.410,00:02:06.410
"So each cubelet has six
faces, but three faces",00:02:06.410,00:02:11.750
are always facing inwards.,00:02:11.750,00:02:13.460
"They're always attached
to the center of the cube.",00:02:13.460,00:02:15.960
So we don't care about them.,00:02:15.960,00:02:17.810
"We only care about
the other three faces.",00:02:17.810,00:02:19.760
"So if you have a
plastic Rubik's cube.",00:02:19.760,00:02:22.060
"Say this is a plastic--
This is a plastic cube.",00:02:22.060,00:02:27.360
"Then you're going to have
eight plastic cubelets.",00:02:27.360,00:02:30.870
"Each cubelet has
three colored faces",00:02:30.870,00:02:32.722
"and three faces that
we don't care about.",00:02:32.722,00:02:34.430
"So how many total plastic
faces in a cubelet, sorry,",00:02:38.440,00:02:42.020
plastic cube?,00:02:42.020,00:02:44.728
"AUDIENCE: Twenty-four.
[INAUDIBLE]",00:02:44.728,00:02:46.144
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:02:50.975,00:02:51.850
"Now let's play with
an imaginary cube.",00:02:51.850,00:02:54.010
"And I call this
a wireframe cube,",00:02:54.010,00:02:56.224
because I draw it like this.,00:02:56.224,00:02:57.390
"So, here pretend you have the
skeleton of a Rubik's cube,",00:03:11.800,00:03:14.460
"made out of wires or out
of wood or something.",00:03:14.460,00:03:17.510
"So it's basically a small sheet
of wood, small piece of wood,",00:03:17.510,00:03:22.130
"small sheet of wood,
so on and so forth.",00:03:22.130,00:03:24.200
"And so this doesn't
have any colors in it,",00:03:24.200,00:03:28.310
"but it's the right shape
and sort of the right look.",00:03:28.310,00:03:32.700
"So the way you would build
the configuration is,",00:03:32.700,00:03:35.440
"you take 24 plastic faces that
you get from a plastic cube,",00:03:35.440,00:03:41.050
"and you paste them one
by one onto the faces",00:03:41.050,00:03:45.590
of a wireframe cube.,00:03:45.590,00:03:47.430
"And they claim that this
can build any configuration",00:03:47.430,00:03:50.200
that you can think about.,00:03:50.200,00:03:53.570
"If you look at a cube, after
no matter how many moves",00:03:53.570,00:03:56.110
"you've done to it,
it's going to have",00:03:56.110,00:03:58.750
"some-- it's going to have
the faces somewhere, right?",00:03:58.750,00:04:01.420
"So you can take the
faces and face them",00:04:01.420,00:04:03.275
"where they belong
and there you go.",00:04:03.275,00:04:05.250
"You have a real cube
built out of a wireframe",00:04:05.250,00:04:07.560
and plastic faces.,00:04:07.560,00:04:08.570
"How many wireframe
faces there are?",00:04:16.810,00:04:19.630
Please don't get this wrong.,00:04:19.630,00:04:21.864
AUDIENCE: Twenty-four.,00:04:21.864,00:04:22.780
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:04:22.780,00:04:25.107
"AUDIENCE: There are
some configurations",00:04:25.107,00:04:26.732
"that aren't possible, right?",00:04:26.732,00:04:28.807
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:04:28.807,00:04:29.390
"There are some configurations
that aren't possible,",00:04:29.390,00:04:31.400
and that is very good news.,00:04:31.400,00:04:32.590
We'll get to that later.,00:04:32.590,00:04:33.640
"Let's see how the code
talks about these faces.",00:04:41.830,00:04:46.060
"So suppose we have a cubelet
that has these faces.",00:04:46.060,00:04:49.720
"Front faces yellow, this face is
blue, and this face is orange.",00:04:49.720,00:04:56.740
"This facing code is called--
so this yellow face here",00:04:56.740,00:05:01.580
is called y o b.,00:05:01.580,00:05:06.520
"So y is yellow, that's
the yellow face,",00:05:06.520,00:05:08.972
"and is the yellow
facing the cubelet that",00:05:08.972,00:05:11.110
"has a yellow face, an orange
face, and a blue face.",00:05:11.110,00:05:14.880
"Fortunately, there
aren't two cubelets",00:05:14.880,00:05:17.010
"that have the same face
color, so this is good enough",00:05:17.010,00:05:20.180
"to distinguish
between all of them.",00:05:20.180,00:05:22.599
"Let's see if you guys
are paying attention.",00:05:22.599,00:05:24.390
How would I call this face?,00:05:24.390,00:05:27.330
AUDIENCE: o y b?,00:05:32.674,00:05:33.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:05:37.914,00:05:38.580
"Either that or o b y, whichever
one the code happens to use.",00:05:38.580,00:05:43.670
"So the principal is,
these are the colors",00:05:43.670,00:05:45.810
"and the first one is the
face that you're pointing at.",00:05:45.810,00:05:49.960
"So there are 24
plastic faces, so there",00:05:49.960,00:05:53.310
"are 24 names for
these plastic faces.",00:05:53.310,00:05:55.960
"Let's see how we name
the wireframe faces.",00:05:55.960,00:05:57.825
"If I take this face-- so
we don't have colors here,",00:06:01.650,00:06:07.570
they're all the same.,00:06:07.570,00:06:08.450
"So instead we care
about their position.",00:06:08.450,00:06:11.550
"A cube has a front
and a back, right?",00:06:11.550,00:06:14.650
"This cubelet is on the
front somewhere, right?",00:06:14.650,00:06:18.770
"So I'm going to have front
somewhere in the name.",00:06:18.770,00:06:23.660
"It has an upper face
and a lower face.",00:06:23.660,00:06:29.610
"Is this going to
be upper or lower?",00:06:29.610,00:06:32.034
AUDIENCE: Upper.,00:06:32.034,00:06:34.990
"PROFESSOR: And
the left or right?",00:06:34.990,00:06:36.816
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:06:36.816,00:06:37.524
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:06:40.870,00:06:41.570
"So front upper right,
which face am I looking at?",00:06:41.570,00:06:46.702
AUDIENCE: The front.,00:06:46.702,00:06:47.777
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:06:47.777,00:06:48.360
"f u r, fur.",00:06:51.330,00:06:53.630
How about this space?,00:06:53.630,00:06:55.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:06:59.524,00:07:00.440
PROFESSOR: So far so good?,00:07:04.940,00:07:07.604
"Or it could be r u f, right?",00:07:07.604,00:07:09.490
PROFESSOR: Or it could be r u f.,00:07:09.490,00:07:10.908
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:07:10.908,00:07:11.824
"PROFESSOR: I really don't know
what it means, I'm behind.",00:07:17.770,00:07:20.322
AUDIENCE: Ruff like a dog?,00:07:20.322,00:07:21.405
It has fur.,00:07:21.405,00:07:22.830
"PROFESSOR: Oh, ruff ruff ruff.",00:07:22.830,00:07:23.100
OK.,00:07:23.100,00:07:23.600
That's not too bad.,00:07:23.600,00:07:24.500
I was afraid of something worse.,00:07:24.500,00:07:25.833
OK.,00:07:25.833,00:07:26.970
That's cool.,00:07:26.970,00:07:28.270
"So a configuration
will take plastic faces",00:07:28.270,00:07:32.860
"and face them onto
the wireframe faces.",00:07:32.860,00:07:34.890
"So a configuration is going
to be an array of 24 elements.",00:07:37.460,00:07:40.730
"And the first element is going
to tell me which plastic face",00:07:47.820,00:07:51.660
"ends up in-- Let's say if
you are the second one,",00:07:51.660,00:07:57.270
"says which plastic
face ends up in r u f,",00:07:57.270,00:08:03.607
"and the third one, let's
assume it's the space.",00:08:03.607,00:08:06.210
AUDIENCE: Ruff.,00:08:09.204,00:08:10.035
PROFESSOR: Ruff.,00:08:10.035,00:08:10.701
"And there are 21
more faces, right?",00:08:14.200,00:08:16.120
"So each face has
a number from zero",00:08:16.120,00:08:17.960
"to 23, because we're in Python,
so we like zero-based indexing.",00:08:17.960,00:08:22.990
"And 24 elements in the
array, 24 plastic faces.",00:08:22.990,00:08:29.050
"Which plastic face
goes into f u r?",00:08:29.050,00:08:32.799
"Assuming this cubelet here--
see, I said cubicle anyway.",00:08:32.799,00:08:37.970
"This cubelet here goes here
in exactly this configuration.",00:08:37.970,00:08:41.945
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:08:45.350,00:08:47.576
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:08:47.576,00:08:49.770
So this face ends up here.,00:08:49.770,00:08:53.110
"And that's what it means that
the first element in the array",00:08:53.110,00:08:55.630
is y o b.,00:08:55.630,00:08:57.420
How about r u f?,00:08:57.420,00:08:59.416
Who ends up in r u f?,00:08:59.416,00:09:00.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:09:03.882,00:09:05.646
AUDIENCE: B o y.,00:09:05.646,00:09:06.312
"PROFESSOR: And who
ends up in e r f?",00:09:10.210,00:09:14.314
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:09:14.314,00:09:15.230
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:09:19.347,00:09:19.930
"So does everyone
understand configurations?",00:09:19.930,00:09:22.680
Does this make sense?,00:09:22.680,00:09:24.422
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:09:24.422,00:09:25.047
I got lost somewhere in there.,00:09:25.047,00:09:26.544
"Can you explain the order
for f u r and [INAUDIBLE]?",00:09:26.544,00:09:30.037
Like front upright?,00:09:30.037,00:09:31.727
PROFESSOR: Oh.,00:09:31.727,00:09:32.310
"So do you mean-- so the
order of the letters.",00:09:32.310,00:09:34.907
So there are two orderings here.,00:09:34.907,00:09:36.240
"One is the order of the
letters and there is an order.",00:09:36.240,00:09:39.500
"I think the code
uses clockwise order,",00:09:39.500,00:09:41.570
"but what really matters is the
first letter tells you which",00:09:41.570,00:09:44.970
face you're talking about.,00:09:44.970,00:09:46.404
AUDIENCE: So this is front face.,00:09:46.404,00:09:48.020
"PROFESSOR: Face, up face.",00:09:48.020,00:09:50.758
AUDIENCE: What's up?,00:09:50.758,00:09:51.666
What's front?,00:09:51.666,00:09:53.940
"PROFESSOR: So for this
cubelet, this is front,",00:09:53.940,00:09:57.480
"this is the right, this is up.",00:09:57.480,00:09:58.730
"This cubelet wold have a
front, an up, and a left.",00:10:02.310,00:10:11.230
"So now there are
24 faces and all",00:10:11.230,00:10:13.580
of them get numbers from 0 23.,00:10:13.580,00:10:16.370
"And here we assume that
f u r is space zero,",00:10:16.370,00:10:19.400
"r u f is space 1, and
e r f is face 2, which",00:10:19.400,00:10:21.800
"is not quite [INAUDIBLE], but
you'll have the mapping there.",00:10:21.800,00:10:26.830
OK.,00:10:26.830,00:10:27.330
"So a configuration is in
an array of 24 elements",00:10:27.330,00:10:30.610
"and it maps plastic faces
to wireframe faces, which",00:10:30.610,00:10:33.450
"brings us to, how many
configurations are there?",00:10:33.450,00:10:36.530
"AUDIENCE: You mean like
mapping 4 factorial?",00:10:43.208,00:10:45.847
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:10:45.847,00:10:46.430
So let's see what it does.,00:10:49.000,00:10:50.280
We have 24 plastic faces.,00:10:50.280,00:10:51.625
From 0 to 23.,00:10:57.600,00:11:00.550
"And they have to be
mapped to 24 positions.",00:11:00.550,00:11:04.832

"AUDIENCE: There's six
colors, aren't there?",00:11:13.537,00:11:15.525
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:11:15.525,00:11:17.040
"PROFESSOR: There are six colors,
but if this is also yellow,",00:11:17.040,00:11:21.022
but there's a red here.,00:11:21.022,00:11:21.980
"This is a different face,
see, this is yellow,",00:11:21.980,00:11:24.160
"red, and there's
a green down here.",00:11:24.160,00:11:26.230
"Then this is the yellow face of
the yellow, green, red cubelet.",00:11:26.230,00:11:29.960
"So we care about the
individual faces.",00:11:29.960,00:11:31.800
"So yeah, your answer was right.",00:11:31.800,00:11:33.141
"I'm trying to explain
it to everyone else.",00:11:33.141,00:11:34.890
But your answer is right.,00:11:34.890,00:11:36.158
"AUDIENCE: Well, wait.",00:11:36.158,00:11:37.033
"But you can't-- I mean, we
talk about some are impossible.",00:11:37.033,00:11:40.485
"Like, you're always gonna
have a grouping of y o b.",00:11:40.485,00:11:43.540
That's never gonna change.,00:11:43.540,00:11:45.352
PROFESSOR: Right.,00:11:45.352,00:11:46.060
"So some of these
aren't reachable,",00:11:46.060,00:11:48.870
"because you're not allowed
to break up the cube.",00:11:48.870,00:11:50.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:11:50.870,00:11:51.730
PROFESSOR: And that's OK.,00:11:51.730,00:11:53.709
"This is still how the
code represents them.",00:11:53.709,00:11:55.500
"So I'm asking if you had-- if
all these would be possible,",00:11:55.500,00:11:59.655
how many would we get?,00:11:59.655,00:12:01.880
"And the answer is that

"So this mapping is called--
anyone good with math?",00:12:07.050,00:12:13.120
AUDIENCE: 1 to 1.,00:12:13.120,00:12:14.460
AUDIENCE: Bijection.,00:12:14.460,00:12:15.560
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:12:15.560,00:12:16.450
So when you're taking-- OK.,00:12:16.450,00:12:22.320
"So when we have two sets and you
have a bijection between them",00:12:22.320,00:12:26.190
"or 1 to 1 mapping, that
function is also called?",00:12:26.190,00:12:31.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:12:31.270,00:12:32.270
"PROFESSOR: You probably
don't know the answer yet.",00:12:32.270,00:12:34.353
"You have to wait
until the end of 6042.",00:12:34.353,00:12:38.900
"So I'm trying to hint that
right now, if you remember",00:12:38.900,00:12:41.300
"the end of 6042, maybe the
answer is somewhere there.",00:12:41.300,00:12:44.264
AUDIENCE: Blur?.,00:12:44.264,00:12:44.930
AUDIENCE: Perfect.,00:12:49.830,00:12:52.770

AUDIENCE: Permut--.,00:12:54.919,00:12:55.710
"AUDIENCE: I totally learned
about that in middle school,",00:12:57.487,00:12:59.820
I think.,00:12:59.820,00:13:01.000
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:13:01.000,00:13:03.276
So this is--,00:13:03.276,00:13:03.775
"AUDIENCE: Permutations
and combinations.",00:13:03.775,00:13:05.590
"PROFESSOR: So this
is a permutation.",00:13:05.590,00:13:07.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:13:07.240,00:13:08.320
"PROFESSOR: How many permutations
do you have out of 24 elements?",00:13:08.320,00:13:11.095
"AUDIENCE: Does that order
[? mean ?] [? matters ?]",00:13:15.100,00:13:17.183
[INAUDIBLE] 24 [INAUDIBLE].,00:13:17.183,00:13:19.155
"PROFESSOR: So this is a
lot of permutations, right?",00:13:23.110,00:13:25.577
"It's a good thing
that we're not going",00:13:25.577,00:13:27.160
"to explore most of
these configurations.",00:13:27.160,00:13:29.830
"So we said before,
that we're going",00:13:29.830,00:13:31.980
"to build a graph where the
vertices are configurations,",00:13:31.980,00:13:36.490
"and the edges are
moves that get us",00:13:36.490,00:13:38.180
"from one configuration
to another configuration.",00:13:38.180,00:13:41.460
"Can they afford to build
this graph first and then run",00:13:41.460,00:13:43.920
BFS on it?,00:13:43.920,00:13:46.850
"Not going to work, right?",00:13:46.850,00:13:48.190
"We don't have
enough RAM for this.",00:13:48.190,00:13:51.410
"So instead we're going
to have to operate",00:13:51.410,00:13:53.220
"on an implicit graph
for presentation.",00:13:53.220,00:13:55.580
"Well, fortunately, BFS
doesn't want the whole graph.",00:13:55.580,00:13:58.340
"The way BFS works is
it has a list of nodes",00:13:58.340,00:14:00.620
"that it has to visit, and
when it visits a node,",00:14:00.620,00:14:02.980
it wants to know its neighbors.,00:14:02.980,00:14:06.170
And that's it.,00:14:06.170,00:14:08.280
Yes?,00:14:08.280,00:14:09.400
Everyone happy with it?,00:14:09.400,00:14:11.290
"So all they have
to do is, in order",00:14:11.290,00:14:14.040
"to build this implicit
graph representation,",00:14:14.040,00:14:16.030
"is we have to know
the start node,",00:14:16.030,00:14:18.200
So BFS can start somewhere.,00:14:18.200,00:14:20.670
"And we have to be able
to give it a node,",00:14:20.670,00:14:23.190
"we have to be able to generate
all the neighbor nodes.",00:14:23.190,00:14:25.860
"So given the
configuration, we have",00:14:25.860,00:14:27.360
"to be able to generate
the configurations that",00:14:27.360,00:14:29.276
"would result by applying
most of that configuration.",00:14:29.276,00:14:33.950
"So what are the moves
that you can do with this?",00:14:33.950,00:14:36.810
Suppose you have a cubelet.,00:14:36.810,00:14:38.440
What are the possible moves?,00:14:38.440,00:14:40.020
There aren't that many.,00:14:40.020,00:14:41.030
"We're interested in the
simplest kind of moves.",00:14:41.030,00:14:44.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:14:44.840,00:14:46.766
"AUDIENCE: Yeah, you
can make the right side",00:14:46.766,00:14:49.260
"go right, which is equivalent
to the left side going left.",00:14:49.260,00:14:52.760
"And then you can do [INAUDIBLE]
4, left [INAUDIBLE].",00:14:52.760,00:14:57.760
AUDIENCE: It's a nice number.,00:14:57.760,00:14:59.260
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:14:59.260,00:15:00.240
"I think there are a few more,
so here's how I look at it.",00:15:00.240,00:15:04.610
"You can take the front
face, so these four,",00:15:04.610,00:15:07.460
"and do a clockwise
rotation, 90 degrees,",00:15:07.460,00:15:10.430
"or you can do a counterclockwise
rotation, 90 degrees.",00:15:10.430,00:15:13.260
"And you can do
that for each face.",00:15:13.260,00:15:16.830
"AUDIENCE: But doing a front
clockwise rotation is the same",00:15:16.830,00:15:20.470
"as doing a back counter
clockwise rotation, which",00:15:20.470,00:15:23.499
is [? it-- ?],00:15:23.499,00:15:24.727
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:15:24.727,00:15:26.700
"PROFESSOR: Doing
a front clockwise,",00:15:26.700,00:15:28.170
"doing a back counterclockwise
is the same thing",00:15:28.170,00:15:30.400
"after you account
for symmetries.",00:15:30.400,00:15:32.990
Yeah.,00:15:32.990,00:15:33.490
AUDIENCE: Exactly.,00:15:33.490,00:15:35.080
AUDIENCE: So it's six?,00:15:35.080,00:15:36.330
PROFESSOR: Yep.,00:15:36.330,00:15:36.520
"So there's only six after
you account for symmetries.",00:15:36.520,00:15:38.728
"Let's play devil's
advocate and assume",00:15:38.728,00:15:40.330
we don't account for symmetries.,00:15:40.330,00:15:41.620
"We're actually doing
the code, because I",00:15:41.620,00:15:43.286
need to teach you something.,00:15:43.286,00:15:45.610
So let's assume we don't apply.,00:15:45.610,00:15:47.616
"By the way, how
would you account",00:15:47.616,00:15:48.990
"for symmetries, easy way?",00:15:48.990,00:15:51.110
"Did anyone read the
comments in the code?",00:15:51.110,00:15:52.990
OK.,00:15:58.091,00:15:58.590
"So would you account
for symmetries.",00:15:58.590,00:16:03.125
"AUDIENCE: Doesn't
it just happen?",00:16:03.125,00:16:04.610
"The permutation is
going to [INAUDIBLE].",00:16:10.070,00:16:11.850
"AUDIENCE: Can you
just look at it,",00:16:11.850,00:16:13.266
"like, each space is neighboring
faces, and [INAUDIBLE]?",00:16:13.266,00:16:18.430
"PROFESSOR: So the way we do
it is we anchor one cubelet.",00:16:18.430,00:16:22.580
"So we have one cubelet that
is a plastic cubelet that",00:16:22.580,00:16:27.870
is always going to go here.,00:16:27.870,00:16:30.910
"So three plastic
faces here are always",00:16:30.910,00:16:34.320
"going to go to three
wireframed faces here.",00:16:34.320,00:16:39.339
"And if you fix those
three faces then",00:16:39.339,00:16:40.880
"you don't have simple
symmetries anymore.",00:16:40.880,00:16:43.690
All right?,00:16:43.690,00:16:44.500
"Three axes of symmetry, so
fixing three faces settles it.",00:16:44.500,00:16:47.684
"AUDIENCE: Wait, so then how
many moves are possible?",00:16:50.774,00:16:52.940
12?,00:16:52.940,00:16:55.430
AUDIENCE: No.,00:16:55.430,00:16:56.090
"But you only do
one thing, though.",00:16:56.090,00:16:57.960
"Now you don't do
counterclock-- you don't do.",00:16:57.960,00:16:59.980
"AUDIENCE: If one is
anchored, there's six left.",00:16:59.980,00:17:01.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:17:01.190,00:17:01.340
Yeah.,00:17:01.340,00:17:01.370
You don't move the anchored one.,00:17:01.370,00:17:02.703
"AUDIENCE: Oh yeah, because
you can only [INAUDIBLE] two",00:17:05.259,00:17:07.550
"of the-- three of
the faces now, but.",00:17:07.550,00:17:11.256
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:17:11.256,00:17:11.839
So let's look at the left face.,00:17:11.839,00:17:15.390
So you have a configuration.,00:17:15.390,00:17:17.660
"So you can move the
left face clockwise,",00:17:17.660,00:17:20.210
left face counterclockwise.,00:17:20.210,00:17:21.760
"You can move the top
face clockwise, top face",00:17:21.760,00:17:26.910
"counterclockwise,
and a couple more.",00:17:26.910,00:17:28.680
So what does a move look like?,00:17:32.240,00:17:35.610
Someone said it before.,00:17:35.610,00:17:36.670
"So when you're doing a move,
what's going to happen is,",00:17:39.190,00:17:42.550
"a move doesn't
create plastic faces",00:17:42.550,00:17:44.652
"and it doesn't
destroy them, right?",00:17:44.652,00:17:46.110
"It just changes their
position on the wireframe.",00:17:46.110,00:17:51.580
"So if you have an initial
configuration that",00:17:51.580,00:17:55.150
"has plastic faces assigned
to wireframe faces,",00:17:55.150,00:17:57.560
"and you have a
final configuration,",00:17:57.560,00:18:02.340
"these plastic faces are
going to end up somewhere",00:18:02.340,00:18:09.882
on the wireframe.,00:18:09.882,00:18:10.590
"And that's true for
all the plastic faces.",00:18:13.380,00:18:15.130
"So the plastic faces are
going to end up somewhere.",00:18:15.130,00:18:19.270
"Also, what's nice is if
we look at the wireframe,",00:18:19.270,00:18:22.930
"if I do a clockwise rotation
in the front, whatever",00:18:22.930,00:18:27.940
"plastic face was here
is going to end up here.",00:18:27.940,00:18:31.440
"Whatever plastic face was
here is going to end up here,",00:18:31.440,00:18:34.520
so on and so forth.,00:18:34.520,00:18:37.374
"So it's a function of rotation
[INAUDIBLE] inside [INAUDIBLE].",00:18:37.374,00:18:41.658
"Like the four faces that
correspond to each other,",00:18:41.658,00:18:45.693
rotate.,00:18:45.693,00:18:46.540
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:18:46.540,00:18:47.930
"That's some good-- that's
going deeper than want to go.",00:18:47.930,00:18:52.010
"I want to account for
something simpler.",00:18:52.010,00:18:55.530
"So my point is that
the arrows will always,",00:18:55.530,00:18:58.120
"if I do a right
clockwise rotation,",00:18:58.120,00:19:02.030
"the arrows will
always look the same.",00:19:02.030,00:19:04.880
"So the only thing that changes
is what's inside the array.",00:19:04.880,00:19:08.200
"But if you take one
configuration array",00:19:08.200,00:19:10.670
"and you move things
according to the way you're",00:19:10.670,00:19:13.750
"supposed to move them for
the front clockwise move,",00:19:13.750,00:19:17.390
"you're going to get
the right result.",00:19:17.390,00:19:20.712
"So what is this a
bunch of arrows called?",00:19:20.712,00:19:22.420
What does it do?,00:19:22.420,00:19:25.510
What does it do to the faces?,00:19:25.510,00:19:26.750
"What does it do to the
elements of the array?",00:19:26.750,00:19:29.286
"AUDIENCE: It moves
in different spots.",00:19:29.286,00:19:31.120
"PROFESSOR: OK, so
fancy math name?",00:19:31.120,00:19:32.982
AUDIENCE: Shuffle.,00:19:32.982,00:19:34.280
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:19:34.280,00:19:35.762
So this is what I got before.,00:19:35.762,00:19:36.970
"This is how you
think of it, right?",00:19:36.970,00:19:38.428
"It's a shuffle, so fancy
math name for a shuttle.",00:19:38.428,00:19:42.404
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:19:42.404,00:19:43.340
PROFESSOR: All right.,00:19:43.340,00:19:46.105
"AUDIENCE: Something
going on here.",00:19:46.105,00:19:48.850
PROFESSOR: So then a move is a?,00:19:48.850,00:19:50.338
"AUDIENCE: Rotation
[? permutation?].",00:19:50.338,00:19:51.838
[INAUDIBLE],00:19:54.754,00:19:55.254
"PROFESSOR: All right, so the
thing is-- the difficult part",00:20:00.640,00:20:03.410
"of the code is you
have two things that",00:20:03.410,00:20:05.190
are represented by permutations.,00:20:05.190,00:20:07.320
"Configurations are
permutations of plastic faces",00:20:07.320,00:20:12.030
"onto the array, onto the
array of wireframes faces.",00:20:12.030,00:20:16.540
"And then a move is a
permutation of a configuration",00:20:16.540,00:20:20.145
into another configuration.,00:20:20.145,00:20:21.270
"OK, so now if I want
to compute neighbors,",00:20:24.340,00:20:26.420
"I take-- we think
there are six moves,",00:20:26.420,00:20:28.730
so I'm going to take six moves.,00:20:28.730,00:20:31.520
"I'm going to type out the
permutations, so 6 times",00:20:31.520,00:20:33.950
"24 numbers, and that's it.",00:20:33.950,00:20:37.800
Now I can compute neighbors.,00:20:37.800,00:20:39.921
Does that make sense?,00:20:39.921,00:20:40.795

have all the permutations.",00:20:43.440,00:20:45.942

are six moves, right?",00:20:45.942,00:20:47.650
"AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
then it's right.",00:20:47.650,00:20:48.063

pieces of good news.",00:22:14.980,00:22:17.920

redundant in our case, two,",00:22:17.920,00:22:20.629

you don't have to write them,",00:22:20.629,00:22:23.170

you how we did them,",00:22:23.170,00:22:25.741

a permutation is cool",00:22:25.741,00:22:29.030
"and I think it's a
good concept to know.",00:22:29.030,00:22:31.054
"So let's look at how
a permutation looks",00:22:31.054,00:22:32.720

"This is how permutations
look like in math mode.",00:22:55.190,00:22:57.940
"If you want to be
more explicit, you",00:22:57.940,00:22:59.520
can add a row numbers above.,00:22:59.520,00:23:01.730
"And this is a bit more explicit
about what a permutation does.",00:23:04.830,00:23:07.860
"So permutation takes an input
list, let's say a b c d e.",00:23:07.860,00:23:11.010
"And for this is an output list,
according to the recipe that",00:23:14.351,00:23:16.850
you see here .,00:23:16.850,00:23:17.790

first element of the output",00:23:17.790,00:23:21.110

of the output is which letter?",00:24:00.060,00:24:03.215

to get c instead of a?",00:24:06.971,00:24:10.740
No.,00:24:10.740,00:24:11.240

sense, wouldn't it?",00:24:12.264,00:24:13.930
Thank you.,00:24:13.930,00:24:15.800
OK.,00:24:15.800,00:24:16.300

start with this.",00:25:03.640,00:25:05.140

get different results.",00:25:07.220,00:25:09.340
"So this is the permutation,
and I want pi to the minus 1.",00:25:09.340,00:25:14.920
AUDIENCE: So you take the value.,00:25:14.920,00:25:20.890
So you have 3 4 1 5 2.,00:25:20.890,00:25:23.150
"So the value at index
1 you put that index,",00:25:23.150,00:25:28.920
"that index has a value
of index 3, et cetera.",00:25:28.920,00:25:35.390

go to position 1?",00:25:35.390,00:25:37.580

that you can run pi,",00:25:41.042,00:25:42.750

eventually equal pi inverse?",00:25:42.750,00:25:49.030
"PROFESSOR: Yes, but
that's complicated algebra",00:25:49.030,00:25:52.272

"Just like make that
[INAUDIBLE] thing that you made",00:25:57.092,00:26:00.650

"Except this doesn't
look very pretty,",00:26:12.349,00:26:13.890
"so I need to sort
them again, right?",00:26:13.890,00:26:15.389
"So 1 3, 2 5, 3 1, 4 2, 5 4.",00:26:15.389,00:26:22.350
Right?,00:26:24.871,00:26:25.370

up with it now?",00:26:25.370,00:26:28.080
Congrats.,00:26:28.080,00:26:29.990
So this is good.,00:26:29.990,00:26:30.740
"This is how you
compute an inverse.",00:26:30.740,00:26:32.198
"Let's figure out why you
compute an inverse that way.",00:26:32.198,00:26:34.640
Let's look at b.,00:26:34.640,00:26:36.200
"So b starts out at
position 2, right?",00:26:36.200,00:26:40.730
"And then pi of 5 equals 2, which
means that, after applying 5,",00:26:40.730,00:26:52.030
b is going to go to position 5.,00:26:52.030,00:26:55.500
"So pi inverse has to
take b and put it where?",00:26:55.500,00:27:00.220
"Back to 2, right?",00:27:00.220,00:27:01.060
"Otherwise it's not
a good inverse.",00:27:01.060,00:27:04.160
So pi inverse of 2.,00:27:04.160,00:27:08.860
"So the second
element in the output",00:27:08.860,00:27:10.410
"has to be which
element in the input?",00:27:10.410,00:27:12.374
"5, right?",00:27:15.360,00:27:17.160
"Otherwise, this wouldn't
undo the effect of pi.",00:27:17.160,00:27:19.840
"So if you write out our
permutation and split",00:27:24.550,00:27:28.140
"the index and the value, we
get the inverse permutation.",00:27:28.140,00:27:31.587
"So you can compute that with a
couple of lines of Python code.",00:27:31.587,00:27:34.170
OK.,00:27:36.770,00:27:37.270
"So this lets us now compute
some of the permutations there.",00:27:37.270,00:27:41.240
"So we only have to type
up two, three, four,",00:27:41.240,00:27:43.460
or something like that.,00:27:43.460,00:27:44.892
"It's a bit nicer
and you guys don't",00:27:44.892,00:27:46.350
"have to type up any,
because we gave them to you.",00:27:46.350,00:27:48.680
Aren't we nice?,00:27:48.680,00:27:51.200

"Any questions about
permutations or Rubik's cubes?",00:27:51.700,00:27:53.783

to get high inverse",00:27:56.790,00:27:58.620
"based off those numbers,
you just-- well,",00:27:58.620,00:28:02.312
it's the same thing.,00:28:02.312,00:28:03.910
"Wait, but 5 got flipped.",00:28:03.910,00:28:06.320
"Or you think the maybe if the
inverse of that matrix then?",00:28:06.320,00:28:09.430
"PROFESSOR: So you take these
two and you flip them, right?",00:28:09.430,00:28:12.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:28:12.260,00:28:13.176
"PROFESSOR: And then you keep
these bound, but you sort them.",00:28:16.140,00:28:19.530
"2 5, 3 1, 4, no-- 3 5 1 2 4.",00:28:22.700,00:28:28.477
"AUDIENCE: Oh they're still
based off the top row?",00:28:28.477,00:28:30.518

"AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.",00:28:31.277,00:28:31.985
"AUDIENCE: Wait, how did
he get the second one?",00:28:31.985,00:28:34.077
AUDIENCE: Based off the top row.,00:28:34.077,00:28:35.410
"PROFESSOR: So you sort this
one, but you keep the bonds,",00:28:35.410,00:28:39.090
"so 3 ends up here and it
gives it 1, 4 ends up here",00:28:39.090,00:28:42.780
and it gives us 2.,00:28:42.780,00:28:45.600
OK.,00:28:45.600,00:28:46.360
So this make sense?,00:28:46.360,00:28:49.370
Good.,00:28:49.370,00:28:49.870
"We're remembering
that, that's good.",00:28:49.870,00:28:51.590
Now let's talk about a problem.,00:28:51.590,00:28:52.890
"So this is a Rubik's cube,
this is how it works.",00:28:52.890,00:28:54.890
"Hopefully we will remember
how to solve game.",00:28:54.890,00:28:57.750
"Let's try to solve
StarCraft Well,",00:28:57.750,00:29:05.130
of course we're going to cheat.,00:29:05.130,00:29:06.526
"We're going to solve a
simpler version of StarCraft",00:29:06.526,00:29:08.650
"because it turns out you
can't really solve StarCraft",00:29:08.650,00:29:11.210
"with the computers
that we have now.",00:29:11.210,00:29:14.950
"So let's make a few
simplifying assumptions.",00:29:14.950,00:29:17.470
"Who play StarCraft, by the way?",00:29:17.470,00:29:20.980
Two?,00:29:20.980,00:29:21.580
OK.,00:29:21.580,00:29:22.080
"So you guys, please
pay attention",00:29:22.080,00:29:23.817
"to the simplifying
assumptions, because this",00:29:23.817,00:29:25.650
isn't real StarCraft.,00:29:25.650,00:29:26.990
"It's a lot easier, so that we
can build a problem out of it.",00:29:26.990,00:29:31.830
All right.,00:29:31.830,00:29:32.330
"So we're going to play
with a race called Zerg.",00:29:32.330,00:29:38.070
"And so the idea of StarCraft
is you build an army",00:29:38.070,00:29:44.230
"and then you take
this army and you",00:29:44.230,00:29:45.820
"destroy your opponent,
nice and simple.",00:29:45.820,00:29:48.140
Good old violent games.,00:29:48.140,00:29:50.860
"So we're going to look at the
build order part of the game.",00:29:50.860,00:29:54.240
"So the build order is the
opening strategy and it takes",00:29:54.240,00:29:56.840
"care of the building process,
so it's the strategy that says,",00:29:56.840,00:30:00.830
"what are you going
to build and when,",00:30:00.830,00:30:02.820
"in order to come up with an
army as quickly as possible?",00:30:02.820,00:30:05.760
"So the main goal is to amass
an army quickly and then take",00:30:05.760,00:30:08.970
"that army and
destroy the opponent.",00:30:08.970,00:30:10.732
"And yes, I know, not
real life StarCraft,",00:30:10.732,00:30:12.440
but let's go with it.,00:30:12.440,00:30:13.780
"OK, so these are the
rules in our toy StarCraft",00:30:18.880,00:30:21.660
"And the Zerg is started with a
building called the hatchery.",00:30:21.660,00:30:26.690
"And out of a hatchery--
the currency of the game,",00:30:26.690,00:30:29.810
"by the way, is minerals.",00:30:29.810,00:30:31.170
"We'll write that
down as dollars.",00:30:31.170,00:30:33.510
"So out of a hatchery
you can build a drone",00:30:33.510,00:30:38.040
by spending 50 minerals.,00:30:38.040,00:30:40.400
"You can build an
overlord by spending 100,",00:30:40.400,00:30:44.760
"or you can build a
Zergling by spending 50.",00:30:44.760,00:30:49.970
"All right, what do
each of these do?",00:30:49.970,00:30:51.940
"A drone harvests minerals
for you, so it's a worker.",00:30:51.940,00:30:55.180
"So, for every drone
that you have,",00:30:55.180,00:30:59.050
you get eight minerals a second.,00:30:59.050,00:31:00.500

minerals a second.",00:31:03.220,00:31:06.100
"As Zergling is your
attack unit, so this",00:31:06.100,00:31:08.060
"is the guy that you want
to build in the end.",00:31:08.060,00:31:10.130
So this destroys your opponents.,00:31:10.130,00:31:12.600
"I don't know how to make a
nice icon for that, so big",00:31:12.600,00:31:16.020
smiley green.,00:31:16.020,00:31:17.540
This makes it happy.,00:31:17.540,00:31:20.260
All right.,00:31:20.260,00:31:20.850
"Overlords help you
control your units,",00:31:20.850,00:31:22.680
"so drones and
Zerglings are units.",00:31:22.680,00:31:26.830
"You can't build-- for every
eight units that you build,",00:31:26.830,00:31:29.670
you have to have an overlord.,00:31:29.670,00:31:31.330
"Otherwise, you can't
build more units",00:31:31.330,00:31:32.960
until you build overlords.,00:31:32.960,00:31:34.710
"So if you have eight drones,
you can't build a ninth on one",00:31:34.710,00:31:38.000
you build an overlord.,00:31:38.000,00:31:38.950
"If you have eight drones
and these eight Zerglings,",00:31:38.950,00:31:41.300
"you have to build
a second overlord",00:31:41.300,00:31:43.020
to be able to build more units.,00:31:43.020,00:31:45.840
"So one overlord can help
you control eight units.",00:31:45.840,00:31:49.225
"In order to build
a Zergling, which",00:31:52.130,00:31:53.900
"is what you want
to do in the end,",00:31:53.900,00:31:55.316
"because these are the attack
units, you need to spend $50,",00:31:55.316,00:31:57.930
"and you also need to
have one building called",00:31:57.930,00:32:00.280
a spawning pool.,00:32:00.280,00:32:01.090
You what?,00:32:05.070,00:32:07.250
All right.,00:32:07.250,00:32:07.800
"So how do you build
that spawning pool?",00:32:07.800,00:32:09.960
"Drones can work for
you, but they can also",00:32:09.960,00:32:12.390
transform into buildings.,00:32:12.390,00:32:14.080
"So a drone mutates into a
building, and after it mutates,",00:32:14.080,00:32:16.749
"it doesn't work for you
anymore, by the way, so no more",00:32:16.749,00:32:19.040
minerals.,00:32:19.040,00:32:20.500
"So a drone can mutate into the
spawning pool for 200 minerals,",00:32:20.500,00:32:28.230
I think.,00:32:28.230,00:32:29.230
It can mutate into a hatchery.,00:32:29.230,00:32:31.740
"That's the same thing
that you have up here for,",00:32:31.740,00:32:35.590
how much is it?,00:32:35.590,00:32:37.230
$450.,00:32:37.230,00:32:40.340
"And it can mutate into
an evolution chamber",00:32:40.340,00:32:43.590
"that we'll talk
about soon, for $400.",00:32:43.590,00:32:51.030
OK.,00:32:51.030,00:32:51.530
"Why do we care about having
more than one hatchery?",00:32:51.530,00:32:54.360
"One hatchery can build one unit
per second, no more than that.",00:32:54.360,00:32:57.650
"So once you have a lot
of drones and you're",00:33:00.689,00:33:02.480
"making a lot of money, you need
to have a lot of hatcheries",00:33:02.480,00:33:05.220
so that you can spend the money.,00:33:05.220,00:33:07.180
"Our goal is not to amass money,
it's to build units, right?",00:33:07.180,00:33:09.670
"So money doesn't
help you, I'm going",00:33:09.670,00:33:11.004
to spend it as fast as possible.,00:33:11.004,00:33:12.337
OK.,00:33:15.140,00:33:16.300
"An evolution chamber
lets you build-- let's",00:33:16.300,00:33:19.126
"you upgrade research
to technologies.",00:33:19.126,00:33:20.850
"And these technologies
aren't like badges.",00:33:20.850,00:33:22.600
"Once you get them,
you keep them.",00:33:22.600,00:33:26.420
"So you can research
an attack upgrade",00:33:26.420,00:33:28.630
"and you can research
a defense upgrade.",00:33:28.630,00:33:33.560
"They're both 1,000 minerals,
but you only have to do it once.",00:33:33.560,00:33:38.030
Why do I care about these?,00:33:38.030,00:33:40.040
"They decide how strong
your Zerglings are.",00:33:40.040,00:33:43.340
"So, given a Zergling, at
the beginning of the game,",00:33:43.340,00:33:47.870
"you don't have the
attack upgrade,",00:33:47.870,00:33:50.670
"and you don't have
a defense upgrade.",00:33:50.670,00:33:52.760
So the Zerglings attack is 1.,00:33:52.760,00:33:55.150
"If you research
the attack upgrade,",00:33:55.150,00:33:57.360
"but you haven't researched
the defense one,",00:33:57.360,00:33:59.580
their total power is 133.,00:33:59.580,00:34:02.530
"If you research the defense
upgrade, but not the attack",00:34:02.530,00:34:05.010
"upgrade, their
total power is 1.2.",00:34:05.010,00:34:07.670
"And after your research both of
them, their total power is 2.",00:34:07.670,00:34:11.750
"Again, oversimplifying.",00:34:11.750,00:34:13.730
"So, we have to build an army
that's as powerful as possible.",00:34:13.730,00:34:17.480
"So in the end you want to
have both of these researched.",00:34:17.480,00:34:21.370
All right.,00:34:21.370,00:34:21.870
"Now there's one more
limitation, that is,",00:34:21.870,00:34:24.080
"you cannot control more than
200 of these units total,",00:34:24.080,00:34:27.280
"because even if you
have a lot of overlords,",00:34:27.280,00:34:29.130
"your brain isn't immensely huge,
so you can only control 200",00:34:29.130,00:34:33.100
units.,00:34:33.100,00:34:34.199
"So we want to build these 200
units as fast as possible.",00:34:34.199,00:34:40.489
"And out of these
200 units, we want",00:34:40.489,00:34:44.699
to have at least 150 Zerglings.,00:34:44.699,00:34:49.330
"If you build 200
drones, you're not",00:34:49.330,00:34:50.794
"going to attack your
opponent with that,",00:34:50.794,00:34:52.460
those aren't very useful.,00:34:52.460,00:34:54.650
"But you need some drones
in order to make money,",00:34:54.650,00:34:56.650
so you need the balance.,00:34:56.650,00:34:58.280
"So the goal is to get to 200
units as quickly as possible,",00:34:58.280,00:35:02.170
and at least 150 Zergs.,00:35:02.170,00:35:03.532
Yes?,00:35:06.160,00:35:07.960
Evolution chamber.,00:35:07.960,00:35:10.560
"Easy, that's too much.",00:35:10.560,00:35:13.811
OK.,00:35:13.811,00:35:14.310
So how do we solve this?,00:35:14.310,00:35:15.624
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:35:18.500,00:35:19.416
"PROFESSOR: So how
do we solve this?",00:35:23.680,00:35:26.830
AUDIENCE: Watch the pros play.,00:35:26.830,00:35:29.064
"PROFESSOR: Well, they're going
to play real StarCraft this",00:35:29.064,00:35:31.480
"is toy StarCraft this is
six-level 6 StarCraft so it's",00:35:31.480,00:35:34.622
not going to work.,00:35:34.622,00:35:37.320
"But there is a simple
strategy, because I",00:35:37.320,00:35:39.030
"haven't added one
last constraint.",00:35:39.030,00:35:42.688
AUDIENCE: Lets me guess.,00:35:42.688,00:35:44.700
PROFESSOR: No.,00:35:44.700,00:35:45.310
"It's going to be
harassing your enemy.",00:35:45.310,00:35:48.340
"But if you don't have to
harass your enemy intuitively",00:35:48.340,00:35:50.590
"and build your economy
first, so first",00:35:50.590,00:35:53.100
"build your drones
and hatcheries,",00:35:53.100,00:35:54.950
"and then pop out
Zerglings, right?",00:35:54.950,00:35:57.222
So there's a greedy strategy.,00:35:57.222,00:35:58.430
"If you spend about an hour
with a sheet of paper,",00:35:58.430,00:36:00.450
"you can realize what
is the right order",00:36:00.450,00:36:02.074
"to build drones and
hatcheries and overlords,",00:36:02.074,00:36:05.510
"so that you get to a nice
big economy, and then, Bam!",00:36:05.510,00:36:08.680
Build Zerglings.,00:36:08.680,00:36:10.944
"Once you get to 50 drones,
you start build Zerglings",00:36:10.944,00:36:13.110
as fast as possible.,00:36:13.110,00:36:14.130
"So this is a greedy
strategy, you",00:36:16.670,00:36:19.540
"don't need to do a
lot of work for that.",00:36:19.540,00:36:21.250
"So we want to make
things more interesting.",00:36:21.250,00:36:23.041
"So in order to make
things more interesting,",00:36:23.041,00:36:25.450
the game time goes in seconds.,00:36:25.450,00:36:26.780
"Everything that we had
here is in seconds.",00:36:26.780,00:36:28.820
"Every two minutes, so two
minutes, which is 120 seconds.",00:36:28.820,00:36:36.865
"So every two minutes
I want to assemble",00:36:36.865,00:36:38.490
"a small pack of
Zerglings and send them",00:36:38.490,00:36:41.570
to the enemy to harass them.,00:36:41.570,00:36:43.160
"And the Antonio enemy
will defend themselves",00:36:43.160,00:36:45.140
"and they will
destroy my Zerglings,",00:36:45.140,00:36:46.690
"but they won't be able to
focus on the game very well.",00:36:46.690,00:36:49.360
"So I need to do this in order
to have a good chance to win.",00:36:49.360,00:36:52.320
"If I don't do this, my
strategy is invalid.",00:36:52.320,00:36:54.290
"AUDIENCE: Does the enemy,
does it do that to us as well?",00:36:54.290,00:36:57.070
PROFESSOR: No.,00:36:57.070,00:36:58.119
We're sending them facts.,00:36:58.119,00:36:59.160
"We are going to have a really
fast strategy, because we're",00:36:59.160,00:37:01.230
"computing the optimal
strategy, so they're not",00:37:01.230,00:37:03.450
going to have time.,00:37:03.450,00:37:04.410
"They're going to
be fighting us off.",00:37:04.410,00:37:06.840
"OK, how many
Zerglings do I send?",00:37:06.840,00:37:09.330
"I have to send enough
Zerglings so that the attack",00:37:09.330,00:37:12.170
"power at minutes 2m is
6 times log 1 plus m.",00:37:12.170,00:37:19.198
"You knew there has to
be some mapping there.",00:37:19.198,00:37:21.031
"So the reason for this is, let's
look at the first two minutes.",00:37:23.720,00:37:27.080
"After two minutes, if we
haven't researched any upgrades,",00:37:27.080,00:37:30.050
"we need to send this
in six Zerglings.",00:37:30.050,00:37:32.500
"If we researched both
upgrades, we only",00:37:32.500,00:37:34.800
need to send in three Zerglings.,00:37:34.800,00:37:37.379
"If we researched
one of the upgrades,",00:37:37.379,00:37:38.920
"we need to send
in five Zerglings.",00:37:38.920,00:37:41.240
"So this is the
total attack power,",00:37:41.240,00:37:42.911
"not the numbers are of
Zerglings that we need to send.",00:37:42.911,00:37:45.160
AUDIENCE: And is minutes?,00:37:50.480,00:37:53.630
"PROFESSOR: Actually,
it's basically",00:37:53.630,00:37:55.110
"which attack wave you're
doing, so every two minutes.",00:37:55.110,00:37:59.810
"AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.",00:37:59.810,00:38:00.600
"So the first one
is m equals zero.",00:38:00.600,00:38:03.060
PROFESSOR: And 1.,00:38:03.060,00:38:05.064
"That is not the one attacking
right in the beginning",00:38:05.064,00:38:07.230
when we don't have Zerglings.,00:38:07.230,00:38:08.764

n equals 3, so on and so forth.",00:38:09.680,00:38:12.310
"AUDIENCE: How did
you get that formula?",00:38:12.310,00:38:13.935
OK.,00:38:16.978,00:38:18.176
"PROFESSOR: Is it
making your life hard?",00:38:18.176,00:38:19.800
"Would that be logged base
2, or is that log base 10?",00:38:19.800,00:38:23.233
"PROFESSOR: Sure, log base 2.",00:38:23.233,00:38:24.399
Fine.,00:38:31.204,00:38:31.704
"OK, so how are we
going to solve this?",00:38:36.857,00:38:38.440
"Intuitively, how did
we solve all the game",00:38:38.440,00:38:40.460
"problems, all the
problems recently?",00:38:40.460,00:38:44.660

first thing we're",00:38:47.982,00:38:49.440
"going to build a graph, right?",00:38:49.440,00:38:50.993
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:38:50.993,00:38:51.880
PROFESSOR: So build a graph.,00:38:51.880,00:38:53.046
"The vertices are the
states of the game,",00:38:55.890,00:38:58.240

me what state I'm in",00:38:58.240,00:39:00.700
"and an edge shows
possible moves that I do.",00:39:00.700,00:39:05.930

in the vertex, what's my state?",00:39:05.930,00:39:09.792
"AUDIENCE: How much money
you have, and how many units",00:39:09.792,00:39:12.648
you have?,00:39:12.648,00:39:14.552

you're making money?",00:39:14.552,00:39:16.932

the states, are",00:39:16.932,00:39:18.870
states-- they're not movable?,00:39:18.870,00:39:21.274

moveable [INAUDIBLE] could",00:39:21.274,00:39:23.440
"do nothing, in the
next second, right?",00:39:23.440,00:39:25.252

you need to keep track of time,",00:39:25.252,00:39:27.710
too?,00:39:27.710,00:39:28.475
AUDIENCE: I don't know.,00:39:28.475,00:39:29.840
PROFESSOR: OK so maybe time.,00:39:29.840,00:39:31.100
What else?,00:39:33.920,00:39:35.668
"AUDIENCE: Badge
[INAUDIBLE] thing.",00:39:35.668,00:39:37.120

going to say buildings.",00:39:42.104,00:39:43.895

Zergling is a building?",00:39:47.380,00:39:50.190

we started looking at units.",00:40:05.065,00:40:08.870

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PHEC--,00:40:26.418,00:40:27.900
PROFESSOR: Almost.,00:40:27.900,00:40:29.179
"So I want to know the
number of hatcheries,",00:40:29.179,00:40:30.970
"because this is how
fast I can produce.",00:40:30.970,00:40:33.280
"But then how many spawning
pools am I going to build?",00:40:33.280,00:40:37.681
Good.,00:40:37.681,00:40:38.180
So that was StarCraft player 1.,00:40:38.180,00:40:39.930
"Once you have a spawning
pool, you can build Zerglings,",00:40:39.930,00:40:42.300
"there's no reason to
build more than one.",00:40:42.300,00:40:44.260
"So a spawning pool is
going to be like a badge.",00:40:44.260,00:40:46.417
"Once you build it, you
have it, you're done.",00:40:46.417,00:40:48.250
So it's Boolean.,00:40:48.250,00:40:49.976
"AUDIENCE: Wait, what's
a spawning pool again?",00:40:49.976,00:40:51.900
"PROFESSOR: So a spawning
pool is something",00:40:51.900,00:40:53.280
"that you build off a drone
and once you have it,",00:40:53.280,00:40:55.280
"you can build Zerglings
from a hatchery.",00:40:55.280,00:40:57.940
So that's all it does.,00:40:57.940,00:40:58.987
"AUDIENCE: Why would
you want two if you",00:40:58.987,00:41:00.612
can build four Zerglings?,00:41:00.612,00:41:02.735
"PROFESSOR: So the spawning
pool doesn't build a Zergling.",00:41:02.735,00:41:05.110
"See, the hatchery
builds the Zerglings.",00:41:05.110,00:41:07.560
"So the spawning
pool is just there.",00:41:07.560,00:41:09.019
"You need to have it
to cross the edge.",00:41:09.019,00:41:10.601
Otherwise you can't.,00:41:10.601,00:41:11.456
AUDIENCE: OK.,00:41:11.456,00:41:11.997
I understand.,00:41:11.997,00:41:13.303
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:41:13.303,00:41:13.886
So what else for buildings?,00:41:16.810,00:41:20.720
"Whether you have
it or not, right?",00:41:20.720,00:41:23.220
OK.,00:41:23.220,00:41:23.830
How about upgrades?,00:41:23.830,00:41:26.172
"[INAUDIBLE] a u, d u.",00:41:26.172,00:41:28.900
"PROFESSOR: So two
flags, a u, d u.",00:41:28.900,00:41:33.060
Cool.,00:41:33.060,00:41:33.560
"So now we have the thorny
issues of money and time.",00:41:33.560,00:41:37.540
"Let's say that we're going to
have some sort of approximation",00:41:37.540,00:41:41.460
"that's going to allow us
to not keep track of money,",00:41:41.460,00:41:44.390
"because money is-- you
can have a lot of money,",00:41:44.390,00:41:47.290
"so that will give us
an explosion of states.",00:41:47.290,00:41:50.057
"So we're going to assume
that we're spending money",00:41:50.057,00:41:52.140
"as fast as possible,
because that's",00:41:52.140,00:41:54.130
what you usually want to do.,00:41:54.130,00:41:56.054
"AUDIENCE: So should your
money always be zero then?",00:41:56.054,00:41:59.040
PROFESSOR: Almost.,00:41:59.040,00:42:00.486
It's very close to that.,00:42:00.486,00:42:01.920
So you start off with no money.,00:42:01.920,00:42:05.840
"You accumulate
money, then you're",00:42:05.840,00:42:07.310
"going to issue some build
orders and build something.",00:42:07.310,00:42:10.230
"And your money's
going to drop, maybe",00:42:10.230,00:42:12.210
"to zero, maybe to almost zero.",00:42:12.210,00:42:14.470
"Then you wait to
accumulate more money,",00:42:14.470,00:42:16.770
issue another build order.,00:42:16.770,00:42:18.630
"Wait to accumulate more money,
hopefully it goes faster now.",00:42:18.630,00:42:22.660
Issue another build order.,00:42:22.660,00:42:24.456
"We're going to approximate
that every time we",00:42:24.456,00:42:26.330
"issue a build order,
so every time we",00:42:26.330,00:42:27.890
"tell our things to
build something,",00:42:27.890,00:42:29.350
the money will drop to zero.,00:42:29.350,00:42:32.420
"So that doesn't mean you
can only build one thing",00:42:32.420,00:42:34.470
"and then your money
drops to zero.",00:42:34.470,00:42:36.120
"If you wait for a few
seconds and then you",00:42:36.120,00:42:39.550
"have two hatcheries and tell
both of them to build drones,",00:42:39.550,00:42:42.390
"you build two drones and
then your money goes to zero.",00:42:42.390,00:42:45.640
"So that means that if we
model our states carefully,",00:42:45.640,00:42:48.909
"we don't have to
keep track of money.",00:42:48.909,00:42:50.450
"AUDIENCE: You should
probably keep track of time.",00:42:56.722,00:42:58.763
"AUDIENCE: Actually
keep track of the rate",00:43:01.697,00:43:04.000
"you're gathering though, right?",00:43:04.000,00:43:06.470
"PROFESSOR: So what's the
rate that you're gathering?",00:43:06.470,00:43:08.750
AUDIENCE: It's the number of--,00:43:08.750,00:43:11.055
"AUDIENCE: Oh [INAUDIBLE]
drones, yeah. [INAUDIBLE], OK.",00:43:11.055,00:43:14.440
"PROFESSOR: So this
multiplied by 8%.",00:43:14.440,00:43:17.721
"AUDIENCE: So we should
keep track of time.",00:43:17.721,00:43:19.947
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:43:19.947,00:43:20.530
"So how would we solve it
if we keep track of time?",00:43:20.530,00:43:23.441
AUDIENCE: You multiply,00:43:26.880,00:43:28.449
"AUDIENCE: Can you do
that layer thing again?",00:43:28.449,00:43:30.282
Where is that?,00:43:30.282,00:43:31.190
"PROFESSOR: So you're going
to have-- so what's a layer?",00:43:31.190,00:43:34.766
"AUDIENCE: Actually, never mind.",00:43:34.766,00:43:36.057
"AUDIENCE: I want to
know what a layer is.",00:43:39.190,00:43:41.240
PROFESSOR: Sorry?,00:43:41.240,00:43:41.968
"AUDIENCE: I want to
know what a layer is.",00:43:41.968,00:43:43.676
"PROFESSOR: So last time we-- we
solved problems by saying that,",00:43:43.676,00:43:47.000
so we had the graph of streets.,00:43:47.000,00:43:48.680
We had a highway graph.,00:43:48.680,00:43:50.000
And that was a 2D graph.,00:43:50.000,00:43:51.820
"And we made it into a
3D graph by adding time",00:43:51.820,00:43:54.190
as a third dimension.,00:43:54.190,00:43:56.260
"So we had layers,
where each layer was,",00:43:56.260,00:43:58.570
"said that you're at
a point in the graph",00:43:58.570,00:44:00.310
at a certain point in time.,00:44:00.310,00:44:03.780
"So there's a layer 4
times 0, layer 4 time 1,",00:44:03.780,00:44:05.769
so on and so forth.,00:44:05.769,00:44:06.560
"And you start at time 0 and
kept going up the graph.",00:44:06.560,00:44:09.250
"AUDIENCE: You have
a flag that says,",00:44:12.687,00:44:14.300
I've just purchased something?,00:44:14.300,00:44:16.180
"Because that way then you'll
know that you've completely",00:44:16.180,00:44:19.600
"exhausted your-- that
maybe that will tell you",00:44:19.600,00:44:23.420
"that you can't buy
anything for awhile, right?",00:44:23.420,00:44:25.502
"Because if we're not
keeping track of money then",00:44:25.502,00:44:27.562
we should know [INAUDIBLE].,00:44:27.562,00:44:28.700
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:44:28.700,00:44:29.283
So that's a good point.,00:44:29.283,00:44:31.200
"So if I have-- so suppose here
I have to wait for five seconds",00:44:31.200,00:44:35.280
"to get enough
money to do a move.",00:44:35.280,00:44:37.060
"If I keep track of
time in my state and I",00:44:37.060,00:44:38.880
have five things here.,00:44:38.880,00:44:41.431
"I also have to keep
track of money, right?",00:44:41.431,00:44:43.180
"I have to know how
much money I'm getting,",00:44:43.180,00:44:44.929
"so that I know where
I'm buying things.",00:44:44.929,00:44:46.600
"On the other hand,
in this case, if I",00:44:46.600,00:44:49.020
"keep track of both time
and money as states,",00:44:49.020,00:44:51.620
"I can implement a
precise strategy.",00:44:51.620,00:44:53.190
I don't need this approximation.,00:44:53.190,00:44:54.523
"If I do that, then what
search algorithm would I use?",00:44:57.060,00:45:01.610
"So if I have time in states,
so each vertex in my note",00:45:01.610,00:45:05.930
"says that I get from some
states to some other state",00:45:05.930,00:45:09.490
in one unit of time.,00:45:09.490,00:45:12.200
"What algorithm do I use
to search for my strategy?",00:45:12.200,00:45:15.975
Yeah.,00:45:20.100,00:45:20.600
Why do I use BFS?,00:45:20.600,00:45:21.659
"AUDIENCE: Because every
edge has the same weight.",00:45:21.659,00:45:23.700
"PROFESSOR: Every edge has
the same weight, right?",00:45:23.700,00:45:25.450
"So if we keep
track of time, then",00:45:25.450,00:45:27.040
"we-- we keep track of time,
we keep track of money,",00:45:27.040,00:45:29.970
"we use BFS, we have a solution.",00:45:29.970,00:45:32.592
So.,00:45:32.592,00:45:33.092
"Let's try to not do
it, either of these.",00:45:44.240,00:45:46.680
"If I don't want to
keep track of time",00:45:46.680,00:45:48.290
"and I don't want to
keep track of money,",00:45:48.290,00:45:50.640
what would an edge be?,00:45:50.640,00:45:53.360
"If I want to say that, hey, this
is a state and this is a state.",00:45:53.360,00:45:57.880
"What should be the
edge connecting them.",00:45:57.880,00:45:59.879
"AUDIENCE: What other
item you got is.",00:45:59.879,00:46:01.420
"AUDIENCE: Is that
after a second?",00:46:01.420,00:46:04.170
"PROFESSOR: So the
distance between these",00:46:04.170,00:46:05.930
"won't be a second, right?",00:46:05.930,00:46:07.550
"If I have to wait
for five seconds to",00:46:07.550,00:46:09.130
"accumulate enough to
issue this build order",00:46:09.130,00:46:11.670
"that would get me
the state then--",00:46:11.670,00:46:13.825
"AUDIENCE: The time
you have to wait?",00:46:13.825,00:46:15.325
"PROFESSOR: So that's what
I would put on an edge.",00:46:18.060,00:46:20.221
"So this way I don't have
to keep track of money,",00:46:20.221,00:46:22.220
"I don't have to
keep track of time.",00:46:22.220,00:46:23.678
So the graph is smaller.,00:46:23.678,00:46:25.130
"So I can look into
bigger graphs.",00:46:25.130,00:46:27.350
"If I do this, what
algorithm do I use?",00:46:27.350,00:46:30.700
To find my strategy?,00:46:30.700,00:46:33.404
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:46:33.404,00:46:34.320
[INTERPOSING VOICES],00:46:34.320,00:46:36.310
"PROFESSOR: So no time, no money.",00:46:36.310,00:46:38.100
And [? extra ?].,00:46:41.650,00:46:43.670
"So this looks
reasonably easy, right?",00:46:43.670,00:46:46.010
"I mean, if you want to get
from one state to another,",00:46:46.010,00:46:49.280
"you see what you'd
have to build,",00:46:49.280,00:46:50.890
"you see how much
it costs, and you",00:46:50.890,00:46:52.870
"see how much you have to wait
to accumulate those resources.",00:46:52.870,00:46:55.910
Except there's one glitch.,00:46:55.910,00:46:57.435
How do we deal with this?,00:47:01.840,00:47:02.990
"How do we make sure that we do
our attacks on time and how do",00:47:02.990,00:47:05.880
"we know that we're-- how
do we keep track of them?",00:47:05.880,00:47:10.518
"AUDIENCE: What is this
again representing?",00:47:10.518,00:47:12.881
"PROFESSOR: So this is
that every two minutes you",00:47:12.881,00:47:14.880
"have to have a
number of Zerglings",00:47:14.880,00:47:16.930
"that you're sending
to attack the enemy.",00:47:16.930,00:47:19.039
"And the number of Zerglings
that you need to have",00:47:19.039,00:47:21.080
"depends on the time and
it depends on the upgrades",00:47:21.080,00:47:23.670
that you got.,00:47:23.670,00:47:24.220
So how do we keep track of this?,00:47:28.650,00:47:30.140
"AUDIENCE: If the edges
are a function of time,",00:47:34.830,00:47:37.650
"then just know that at radius
120-- at radius 120 over 5,",00:47:37.650,00:47:46.853
"then you'd have to
send more Zerglings.",00:47:46.853,00:47:50.610
"PROFESSOR: So what if not all
the edges have the same weight.",00:47:50.610,00:47:55.110
"So let's look at how a graph
looks like for a little bit.",00:47:55.110,00:47:57.840
"So we're going to
have an initial state,",00:47:57.840,00:48:00.810
"say one hatchery and six
drones and one overlord.",00:48:00.810,00:48:06.710
"And we want to
build a new drone.",00:48:06.710,00:48:11.016
"Say we want to
build a new drone.",00:48:11.016,00:48:12.390
A drone costs 50 minerals.,00:48:12.390,00:48:15.060
We have six drones.,00:48:15.060,00:48:17.730
"Each drone gets us
eight minerals a second,",00:48:17.730,00:48:19.890
"so in one second we're
going to get 48 minerals.",00:48:19.890,00:48:22.510
"So bummer, we have to wait for
two seconds to build one drone.",00:48:22.510,00:48:25.180
"And now we're going to be in
the state of one hatchery, seven",00:48:29.700,00:48:34.660
"drones, one overlord.",00:48:34.660,00:48:39.830
"If you said we want to
build a hatchery-- then",00:48:39.830,00:48:45.900
"we're going to need to
accumulate 400 or 450.",00:48:45.900,00:48:50.260
"Oh, we have to accumulate 450,
using six drones, 48 minerals,",00:48:50.260,00:48:56.340
so I guess nine seconds.,00:48:56.340,00:48:58.222
"So we're going to have
to wait for nine seconds",00:48:58.222,00:49:00.180
to get that money.,00:49:00.180,00:49:01.070
"And then when we
build, we're going",00:49:03.772,00:49:05.230
"to spend the drone
building, because it's",00:49:05.230,00:49:07.240
going to turn into a hatchery.,00:49:07.240,00:49:08.500
"And then we're going to end
up with two hatcheries, five",00:49:08.500,00:49:12.330
"drones, and one overlord.",00:49:12.330,00:49:14.820
So edges have different weights.,00:49:14.820,00:49:17.030
"So I can't look at the radius
in terms of number of his edges.",00:49:17.030,00:49:19.937
"AUDIENCE: Everything
builds instantaneously.",00:49:19.937,00:49:21.770
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, sure.",00:49:24.750,00:49:25.696
"AUDIENCE: You could keep track
of just the total distance",00:49:25.696,00:49:28.070
"from whatever starting
build you are?",00:49:28.070,00:49:30.370
"AUDIENCE: Actually,
if the distance",00:49:30.370,00:49:32.250
"from the origin to where
you're at is a multiple of 120,",00:49:32.250,00:49:35.980
"then you should
have another state",00:49:35.980,00:49:38.820
that you have to [INAUDIBLE].,00:49:38.820,00:49:42.288
"AUDIENCE: Assuming you have any
drones left, hopefully you do.",00:49:42.288,00:49:46.240
PROFESSOR: So that's modeling.,00:49:46.240,00:49:48.654
"One way of doing it is
sure, model every round",00:49:48.654,00:49:50.570
"of the attack as one,
every round of harassment",00:49:50.570,00:49:53.190
"is one there in the graph,
and we can do it that way.",00:49:53.190,00:49:56.460
Is that what you're saying?,00:49:56.460,00:49:58.760
"So you can't-- once
you're at 120 seconds,",00:49:58.760,00:50:01.562
"you have to do an attack and
then you get to the next layer",00:50:01.562,00:50:04.020
in the graph.,00:50:04.020,00:50:05.320
"AUDIENCE: That makes
a lot of sense.",00:50:05.320,00:50:05.900
"AUDIENCE: Of course that's
what we were thinking.",00:50:05.900,00:50:07.900
"PROFESSOR: How about
let's not do that.",00:50:07.900,00:50:09.524
"How about let's represent
it without layers?",00:50:09.524,00:50:11.790
So that's good.,00:50:11.790,00:50:12.610
"You're getting closer
to the solution.",00:50:12.610,00:50:14.193
"It is much better than
representing every time.",00:50:14.193,00:50:16.620
"Write the number of
layers this time over 120,",00:50:16.620,00:50:18.926
it's a huge improvement.,00:50:18.926,00:50:20.720
"Well, we can do it
without any-- we can do it",00:50:20.720,00:50:24.070
"without any time
notion whatsoever.",00:50:24.070,00:50:27.384
"Let's see, can I let
you think about it?",00:50:27.384,00:50:29.050
"Oh, I can let you think
about it for 30 seconds.",00:50:29.050,00:50:31.135
"So there's a key
insight here that--",00:50:37.490,00:50:39.377
AUDIENCE: Ooh.,00:50:39.377,00:50:39.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:50:39.960,00:50:42.256
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] but if
you figure how much time has",00:50:42.256,00:50:44.740
"elapsed, based on
the items we have",00:50:44.740,00:50:47.050
"and our starting state, right?",00:50:47.050,00:50:48.766
"Because if we have
two hatcheries",00:50:48.766,00:50:50.140
"and we started
with one hatchery,",00:50:50.140,00:50:51.625
"we know that at least
nine seconds has elapsed.",00:50:51.625,00:50:53.730
"PROFESSOR: Well, so I like the
first part of what you said,",00:50:53.730,00:50:56.190
"the second part is
too complicated.",00:50:56.190,00:50:58.350
"But we can know
what time we're at.",00:50:58.350,00:51:01.740
Why?,00:51:01.740,00:51:03.190
"AUDIENCE: Because it takes
a certain amount of time",00:51:03.190,00:51:05.350
"to achieve everything,
each thing.",00:51:05.350,00:51:09.241
"AUDIENCE: Are we assuming
that we take the shortest",00:51:09.241,00:51:11.366
"path to get to each
state that we're at?",00:51:11.366,00:51:14.931
"PROFESSOR: So we're
using the extra.",00:51:14.931,00:51:16.430
How does the extra work?,00:51:19.250,00:51:20.510
"You have a queue,
a priority queue.",00:51:20.510,00:51:22.630
"You extract a node, you
look at the neighbors.",00:51:22.630,00:51:25.140
"When you extract
the node, do you",00:51:25.140,00:51:26.650
know the distance to that node?,00:51:26.650,00:51:30.557
AUDIENCE: Can you explain?,00:51:30.557,00:51:31.640
You ask?,00:51:31.640,00:51:33.110
PROFESSOR: I'm asking.,00:51:33.110,00:51:34.045
"AUDIENCE: I know, but like
the node asks and says,",00:51:34.045,00:51:36.220
how far away are you?,00:51:36.220,00:51:39.074
"PROFESSOR: So you need to keep
that in the priority queue.",00:51:39.074,00:51:41.490
"So the extra--
the main invariant",00:51:41.490,00:51:44.100
"is that once you
pull out the node,",00:51:44.100,00:51:46.330
"you're not going to find any
shorter path to that node.",00:51:46.330,00:51:49.467
"So you already know
the shortest path.",00:51:49.467,00:51:51.050
"That how you sort the nodes
in the priority queue.",00:51:51.050,00:51:53.860
"So when we're at
a configuration--",00:51:53.860,00:51:57.920
"Say we're at some
configuration here,",00:51:57.920,00:52:00.330
"two hatches, six drones,
and five Zerglings.",00:52:00.330,00:52:07.090
"We already know that, say
we're at time 119 seconds.",00:52:07.090,00:52:11.780
"If what I want to do next
is build another hatchery,",00:52:11.780,00:52:15.940
"then I have to wait, what, six
drones, same thing as before.",00:52:15.940,00:52:18.836
"I have to wait for
nine seconds, right?",00:52:18.836,00:52:20.460
"So the edge would
look like this.",00:52:23.450,00:52:25.850
"And then we're going to get
to three hatcheries, five",00:52:25.850,00:52:28.270
"drones, five Zerglings.",00:52:28.270,00:52:31.480
"This crosses a one, this crosses
a two-minute boundary, right?",00:52:31.480,00:52:35.200
"So when I cross
this boundary, I'd",00:52:39.110,00:52:40.810
"better have enough
Zerglings to do an attack.",00:52:40.810,00:52:42.980
"Do I have enough
Zerglings to do an attack?",00:52:42.980,00:52:46.660
No.,00:52:46.660,00:52:47.520
So is this a valid move?,00:52:47.520,00:52:48.920
"Is this the valid
edge in our graph?",00:52:48.920,00:52:52.610
It's not.,00:52:52.610,00:52:54.480
"So when you're at a node,
you already know the time",00:52:54.480,00:52:56.700
"that you need to
get to that node,",00:52:56.700,00:52:58.120
"so when you generate
the neighbors,",00:52:58.120,00:53:00.070
"you can check for
each edge to see",00:53:00.070,00:53:01.630
it crosses that 120 second game.,00:53:01.630,00:53:04.149
Now let's assume it does.,00:53:04.149,00:53:05.190
"Let's see how this
works and this",00:53:05.190,00:53:06.564
is the last thing we're doing.,00:53:06.564,00:53:08.350
"So suppose you have two
hatcheries, six drones,",00:53:08.350,00:53:12.260
and eight Zerglings.,00:53:12.260,00:53:14.390
"And you're going to
build that same hatchery.",00:53:14.390,00:53:18.380
"So you're going to go
past this 120 second mark.",00:53:18.380,00:53:22.990
"What state are you
going to end up in?",00:53:22.990,00:53:24.635
How many hatcheries?,00:53:27.250,00:53:28.707
AUDIENCE: Three.,00:53:28.707,00:53:29.960
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:53:29.960,00:53:31.140
How many drones.,00:53:31.140,00:53:32.330
AUDIENCE: Five.,00:53:32.330,00:53:33.585
PROFESSOR: How many Zerglings.,00:53:33.585,00:53:34.834
AUDIENCE: Two.,00:53:34.834,00:53:37.618
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:53:37.618,00:53:39.010
"So key elements, two
Zerglings, because this edge",00:53:39.010,00:53:42.950
"crosses the 120-second
harassment boundary,",00:53:42.950,00:53:46.200
"so you have to send
in six Zerglings",00:53:46.200,00:53:47.800
and you're going to lose them.,00:53:47.800,00:53:50.370
"So we're taking advantage of
how the extra works to sort",00:53:50.370,00:53:53.580
"of generate our
edges on the fly.",00:53:53.580,00:53:55.620
"So we wouldn't be able
to regenerate this graph,",00:53:55.620,00:53:58.390
even if we wanted to have to.,00:53:58.390,00:53:59.610
"We have to work with the
implicit representation",00:53:59.610,00:54:01.610
"and, as we learn the
distances to the nodes,",00:54:01.610,00:54:04.610
"the minimum distances,
we also learned the edges",00:54:04.610,00:54:07.990
"that we have coming
out of those nodes.",00:54:07.990,00:54:10.165
"AUDIENCE: So it's kinda of
like this graph that's growing",00:54:10.165,00:54:12.540
"and we're like as it
gets to a certain point",00:54:12.540,00:54:14.373
"we kill a bunch of paths
and then it keeps on going.",00:54:14.373,00:54:17.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:54:17.340,00:54:19.459
Doesn't this makes sense?,00:54:19.459,00:54:20.500
"So the good news is
that this is like we're",00:54:25.010,00:54:27.420
"training you to run
a 10-mile marathon,",00:54:27.420,00:54:29.310
"so you can run 50
meters for the test.",00:54:29.310,00:54:32.230
"Let's still try to
get it, because I",00:54:32.230,00:54:33.730
think it's a cool problem.,00:54:33.730,00:54:35.880
