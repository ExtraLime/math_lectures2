"Previously, we learned the
concept of independent",00:00:00.590,00:00:03.420
experiments.,00:00:03.420,00:00:04.890
"In this exercise, we'll see how
the seemingly simple idea",00:00:04.890,00:00:08.119
"of independence can help us
understand the behavior of",00:00:08.119,00:00:11.080
quite complex systems.,00:00:11.080,00:00:13.240
"In particular, we'll combined
the concept of independence",00:00:13.240,00:00:15.720
"with the idea of divide and
conquer, where we break a",00:00:15.720,00:00:19.430
"larger system into smaller
components, and then using",00:00:19.430,00:00:22.630
"independent properties to
glue them back together.",00:00:22.630,00:00:26.310
"Now, let's take a look
at the problem.",00:00:26.310,00:00:27.740
"We are given a network of
connected components, and each",00:00:27.740,00:00:30.950
component can be good with,00:00:30.950,00:00:32.299
probability P or bad otherwise.,00:00:32.299,00:00:35.680
"All components are independent
from each other.",00:00:35.680,00:00:38.370
"We say the system is operational
if there exists a",00:00:38.370,00:00:41.620
"path connecting point A here
to point B that go through",00:00:41.620,00:00:47.620
only the good components.,00:00:47.620,00:00:49.690
"And we'd like to understand,
what is the probability that",00:00:49.690,00:00:52.450
system is operational?,00:00:52.450,00:00:54.490
"Which we'll denote
by P of A to B.",00:00:54.490,00:01:01.794
"Although the problem might seem
a little complicated at",00:01:01.794,00:01:04.150
"the beginning, it turns
out only two",00:01:04.150,00:01:05.920
structures really matter.,00:01:05.920,00:01:07.420
So let's look at each of them.,00:01:07.420,00:01:10.800
"In the first structure, which we
call the serial structure,",00:01:10.800,00:01:14.320
"we have a collection of k
components, each one having",00:01:14.320,00:01:18.640
"probability P being good,
connected one next to each",00:01:18.640,00:01:22.290
other in a serial line.,00:01:22.290,00:01:24.230
"Now, in this structure, in order
for there to be a good",00:01:24.230,00:01:26.770
"path from A to B, every
single one of the",00:01:26.770,00:01:29.500
components must be working.,00:01:29.500,00:01:31.380
"So the probability of having
a good path from A to B is",00:01:31.380,00:01:35.380
"simply P times P, so on and so,
repeated k times, which is",00:01:35.380,00:01:41.640
P raised to the k power.,00:01:41.640,00:01:43.940
"Know that the reason we can
write the probability this",00:01:43.940,00:01:46.320
"way, in terms of this product,
is because of the",00:01:46.320,00:01:49.530
independence property.,00:01:49.530,00:01:51.210
 ,00:01:51.210,00:01:58.720
"Now, the second useful",00:01:58.720,00:01:59.510
structure is parallel structure.,00:01:59.510,00:02:01.750
"Here again, we have k components
one, two, through",00:02:01.750,00:02:05.265
"k, but this time they're
connected in parallel to each",00:02:05.265,00:02:08.419
"other, namely they start from
one point here and ends at",00:02:08.419,00:02:11.780
"another point here,
and this holds for",00:02:11.780,00:02:13.900
every single component.,00:02:13.900,00:02:15.420
"Now, for the parallel structure
to work, namely for",00:02:15.420,00:02:18.250
"there to exist a good path from
A to B, it's easy to see",00:02:18.250,00:02:22.370
"that as long as one of these
components works the whole",00:02:22.370,00:02:25.330
thing will work.,00:02:25.330,00:02:26.760
"So the probability of A to B
is the probability that at",00:02:26.760,00:02:30.640
"least one of these
components works.",00:02:30.640,00:02:33.260
"Or in the other word, the
probability of the complement",00:02:33.260,00:02:36.260
"of the event where all
components fail.",00:02:36.260,00:02:39.125
"Now, if each component has
probability P to be good, then",00:02:39.125,00:02:44.740
"the probability that all key
components fail is 1 minus P",00:02:44.740,00:02:49.920
raised to the kth power.,00:02:49.920,00:02:51.740
"Again, having this expression
means that we have used the",00:02:51.740,00:02:55.000
"property of independence, and
that is probability of having",00:02:55.000,00:02:58.620
a good parallel structure.,00:02:58.620,00:03:00.990
"Now, there's one more
observation that will be",00:03:00.990,00:03:02.760
useful for us.,00:03:02.760,00:03:03.800
"Just like how we define two
components to be independent,",00:03:03.800,00:03:07.360
"we can also find two collections
of components to",00:03:07.360,00:03:10.920
"be independent from
each other.",00:03:10.920,00:03:13.430
"For example, in this diagram,
if we call the components",00:03:13.430,00:03:16.820
"between points C and E as
collection two, and the",00:03:16.820,00:03:21.580
"components between E and
B as collection three.",00:03:21.580,00:03:25.580
"Now, if we assume that each
component in both",00:03:25.580,00:03:28.760
collections--,00:03:28.760,00:03:29.570
"they're completely independent
from each other, then it's not",00:03:29.570,00:03:32.210
"hard to see that collection
two and three behave",00:03:32.210,00:03:35.600
independently.,00:03:35.600,00:03:36.780
"And this will be very helpful
in getting us the breakdown",00:03:36.780,00:03:41.250
"from complex networks
to simpler elements.",00:03:41.250,00:03:45.710
"Now, let's go back to the
original problem of",00:03:45.710,00:03:47.630
"calculating the probability of
having a good path from point",00:03:47.630,00:03:50.990
"big A to point big B
in this diagram.",00:03:50.990,00:03:54.560
"Based on that argument of
independent collections, we",00:03:54.560,00:03:57.920
"can first divide the whole
network into three",00:03:57.920,00:04:00.070
"collections, as you see here,
from A to C, C to E and E to",00:04:00.070,00:04:04.870
"B. Now, because they're
independent and in a serial",00:04:04.870,00:04:09.330
"structure, as seen by the
definition of a serial",00:04:09.330,00:04:12.180
"structure here, we see that the
probability of A to B can",00:04:12.180,00:04:16.140
"be written as a probability of
A to C multiplied by C to E,",00:04:16.140,00:04:24.580
"and finally, E to B.",00:04:24.580,00:04:29.230
"Now, the probability of A to
C is simply P because the",00:04:29.230,00:04:33.880
"collection contains
only one element.",00:04:33.880,00:04:36.510
"And similarly, the probability
of E to B is not that hard",00:04:36.510,00:04:41.090
"knowing the parallel
structure here.",00:04:41.090,00:04:43.070
"We see that collection three
has two components in",00:04:43.070,00:04:47.010
"parallel, so this probability
will be given by 1 minus 1",00:04:47.010,00:04:53.500
minus P squared.,00:04:53.500,00:04:55.945
 ,00:04:55.945,00:04:59.480
"And it remains to calculate just
the probability of having",00:04:59.480,00:05:02.930
"a good path from point C to
point E. To get a value for P",00:05:02.930,00:05:08.650
"C to E, we notice again, that
this area can be treated as",00:05:08.650,00:05:16.710
"two components, C1 to E and C2
to E connected in parallel.",00:05:16.710,00:05:24.260
"And using the parallel law we
get this probability is 1",00:05:24.260,00:05:27.570
"minus 1 minus P C1 to E
multiplied by the 1 minus P C2",00:05:27.570,00:05:36.790
"to E. Know that I'm using two
different characters, C1 and",00:05:36.790,00:05:43.010
"C2, to denote the same node,
which is C. This is simply for",00:05:43.010,00:05:47.760
"making it easier to analyze
two branches where they",00:05:47.760,00:05:51.610
"actually do note
the same node.",00:05:51.610,00:05:53.930
"Now P C1 to E is another serial
connection of these",00:05:53.930,00:06:02.600
"three elements here with
another component.",00:06:02.600,00:06:08.660
"So the first three elements are
connected in parallel, and",00:06:08.660,00:06:13.580
"we know the probability of that
being successful is 1",00:06:13.580,00:06:16.580
"minus P3, and the
last one is P.",00:06:16.580,00:06:22.430
"And finally, P C2 to E. It's
just a single element",00:06:22.430,00:06:29.570
"component with probability of
successful being P. At this",00:06:29.570,00:06:34.400
"point, there is no longer any
unknown variables, and we have",00:06:34.400,00:06:37.720
"indeed obtained exact values
for all the quantities that",00:06:37.720,00:06:41.180
we're interested in.,00:06:41.180,00:06:42.740
"So starting from this equation,
we can plug in the",00:06:42.740,00:06:44.960
"values for P C2 to E, P C1 to E
back here, and then further",00:06:44.960,00:06:51.290
plug in P C to E back here.,00:06:51.290,00:06:54.520
"That will give us the final
solution, which is given by",00:06:54.520,00:06:57.880
"the following somewhat
complicated formula.",00:06:57.880,00:07:01.370
"So in summary, in this problem,
we learned how to use",00:07:01.370,00:07:04.240
"the independence property among
different components to",00:07:04.240,00:07:07.820
"break down the entire fairly
complex network into simple",00:07:07.820,00:07:11.850
"modular components, and use the
law of serial and parallel",00:07:11.850,00:07:15.570
"connections to put the
probabilities back together in",00:07:15.570,00:07:19.580
"common with the overall success
probability of finding",00:07:19.580,00:07:22.640
a path from A to B.,00:07:22.640,00:07:24.700
