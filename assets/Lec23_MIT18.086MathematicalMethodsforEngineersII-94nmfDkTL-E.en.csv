PROFESSOR: Let's get started.,00:00:17.090,00:00:19.790
"Could I start first with
an announcement of a talk",00:00:19.790,00:00:25.510
this afternoon.,00:00:25.510,00:00:27.670
"I know your schedules
are full, but --",00:00:27.670,00:00:32.350
"the abstract for the talk I
think will go up on the top",00:00:32.350,00:00:37.020
of our web page.,00:00:37.020,00:00:38.730
"It's a whole range
of other applications",00:00:42.300,00:00:45.200
"that I would hope to
get to, by an expert.",00:00:45.200,00:00:49.550
"Professor Rannacher,
his applications",00:00:49.550,00:00:52.140
"include optimal control,
which is certainly",00:00:52.140,00:00:54.750
a big area of optimization.,00:00:54.750,00:00:58.610
"Actually, MathWorks, we think
of them as doing linear algebra,",00:00:58.610,00:01:04.160
"but their number one customer
is the control theory world,",00:01:04.160,00:01:08.910
"and it totally connects
with everything we're doing.",00:01:08.910,00:01:14.070
"He's also interested in adaptive
meshing for finite element",00:01:14.070,00:01:20.220
"or other methods -- how to
refine the mesh where it pays",00:01:20.220,00:01:25.700
"off in arrow problems,
all sorts of problems.",00:01:25.700,00:01:32.720
"The math behind it is this
same saddle point structure,",00:01:32.720,00:01:38.350
"same KK -- when he
says KKT equations,",00:01:38.350,00:01:42.270
that's our two equations.,00:01:42.270,00:01:44.390
"I've been calling them,
sometimes, Kuhn-Tucker,",00:01:44.390,00:01:47.670
"but after Kuhn
and Tucker, it was",00:01:47.670,00:01:49.830
"noticed that a graduate
student named Karush, also a K,",00:01:49.830,00:01:55.370
"had written a Masters thesis in
which these important equations",00:01:55.370,00:01:59.740
appeared.,00:01:59.740,00:02:00.740
"So now, they're often
called KKT equations.",00:02:00.740,00:02:03.590
I think Rannacher will do that.,00:02:03.590,00:02:05.920
"Anyway, I don't
know if you're free,",00:02:05.920,00:02:08.220
"but it'll be a full talk in this
program of computational design",00:02:08.220,00:02:17.300
and optimization.,00:02:17.300,00:02:18.360
"I don't know if you know
MIT's new masters degree",00:02:18.360,00:02:22.100
program in CDO.,00:02:22.100,00:02:24.590
"So it's mostly engineering,
a little optimization",00:02:24.590,00:02:29.800
"that's down in
Operations Research,",00:02:29.800,00:02:32.160
and a couple of guys in math.,00:02:32.160,00:02:35.140
"So that's a talk
this afternoon, which",00:02:35.140,00:02:38.490
"will be right on
target for this area",00:02:38.490,00:02:43.560
"and bring up applications
that are highly important.",00:02:43.560,00:02:48.690
"Well, so I thought
today, my job is going",00:02:48.690,00:02:54.652
to be pretty straightforward.,00:02:54.652,00:02:55.860
"I want to do now the
continuous problem.",00:02:59.420,00:03:02.300
So I have functions as unknowns.,00:03:02.300,00:03:05.020
"I have integrals
as inner products.",00:03:05.020,00:03:09.360
"But I still have a
minimization problem.",00:03:09.360,00:03:12.410
"So I have a minimization
problem and I'll call,",00:03:12.410,00:03:15.100
"it's often a
potential energy, so",00:03:15.100,00:03:17.300
"let me use P. Our
unknown function is u,",00:03:17.300,00:03:21.460
"so that's a function u of
x; u of x, y; u of x, y, z.",00:03:21.460,00:03:26.620
"And instead of inner
products we have integrals,",00:03:26.620,00:03:30.320
so there's a c of x.,00:03:30.320,00:03:31.810
"This is going to be
a pure quadratic,",00:03:35.010,00:03:36.960
"so it's going to lead
me to a linear equation.",00:03:36.960,00:03:39.770
"In between comes
something important --",00:03:43.540,00:03:47.250
"what people now call the
weak form of the equation.",00:03:47.250,00:03:53.250
"So, this is would
be the simplest",00:03:53.250,00:03:59.580
"example I could put forward
of the calculus of variations.",00:03:59.580,00:04:07.042
"So that's what
we're talking about.",00:04:07.042,00:04:08.500
Calculus of variations.,00:04:08.500,00:04:10.240
"What's the derivative
of P with respect to u?",00:04:14.320,00:04:17.360
"Somehow, that's what
we have to find,",00:04:17.360,00:04:19.120
"and we're going to set
it to zero to minimize.",00:04:19.120,00:04:22.810
"Then why do we know
it's a minimum?",00:04:22.810,00:04:24.800
"Well, that's always
the second --",00:04:24.800,00:04:26.860
"the quadratic terms here
are going to be positive.",00:04:26.860,00:04:32.060
"So we have a positive
definite problem.",00:04:32.060,00:04:34.980
"Positive definite means
things go this way, convex,",00:04:38.590,00:04:43.200
"and you locate the
bottom, the minimum",00:04:43.200,00:04:47.560
is where the derivative is zero.,00:04:47.560,00:04:50.130
But what's the derivative?,00:04:50.130,00:04:51.410
That's the question.,00:04:51.410,00:04:53.680
"It's not even called
derivative in this subject,",00:04:53.680,00:04:56.800
it's called the first variation.,00:04:56.800,00:04:59.110
"Instead of saying
first derivative,",00:04:59.110,00:05:01.630
I'll say first variation.,00:05:01.630,00:05:03.740
"And instead of writing
dP/du, I'll write --",00:05:03.740,00:05:09.700
where can I write it?,00:05:09.700,00:05:10.980
"So this is key word,
so this is going",00:05:10.980,00:05:14.455
"to be the first
variation, and I'm",00:05:14.455,00:05:18.660
"going to write it with a
different d, a Greek delta,",00:05:18.660,00:05:24.080
dP/du.,00:05:24.080,00:05:25.490
"It's just sort of a
reminder that we're",00:05:25.490,00:05:27.510
"dealing with functions
and integrals of functions",00:05:27.510,00:05:32.422
and so on.,00:05:32.422,00:05:33.300
"So it's just change the
notation in the name",00:05:33.300,00:05:36.210
"a little as a trigger
to the memory.",00:05:36.210,00:05:42.150
"But this board
really has a lot --",00:05:42.150,00:05:47.840
"not all the details
are here, of course.",00:05:47.840,00:05:50.230
"This is a summary of what the
calculus of variations does.",00:05:50.230,00:05:56.030
"So it takes a
minimization problem.",00:05:56.030,00:06:00.660
"So I'm looking for
a function u of x.",00:06:00.660,00:06:03.840
"And always since we're
in continuous problems,",00:06:03.840,00:06:08.720
we have boundary conditions.,00:06:08.720,00:06:10.490
"So as always, those could be --
let me imagine that those are",00:06:10.490,00:06:17.390
the boundary conditions.,00:06:17.390,00:06:19.800
"So I would call those
essential conditions.",00:06:19.800,00:06:23.950
"Every function that's
allowed into the minimum",00:06:23.950,00:06:27.600
"has to satisfy the
boundary condition.",00:06:27.600,00:06:30.050
"So it's a minimum over all u
with the boundary conditions,",00:06:30.050,00:06:35.039
with those boundary conditions.,00:06:35.039,00:06:36.330
"There are two kinds of
boundary conditions,",00:06:40.719,00:06:42.510
"and maybe I'll postpone thinking
about boundary conditions",00:06:42.510,00:06:45.940
"till I get the equations,
the differential",00:06:45.940,00:06:48.740
equation inside the interval.,00:06:48.740,00:06:51.970
"So all these intervals
go from zero to one.",00:06:51.970,00:06:54.360
I won't put that.,00:06:54.360,00:06:56.010
We're in 1D.,00:06:56.010,00:06:56.710
"So, how do you find
the function, u of x?",00:06:59.300,00:07:03.890
that stands for du/dx.,00:07:03.890,00:07:06.990
"So the given data
for the problem",00:07:06.990,00:07:10.340
"is some load, some
source term, f",00:07:10.340,00:07:12.985
"of x, which is going to show
up on the right-hand side,",00:07:12.985,00:07:16.820
"and some coefficient
c of x, which is going",00:07:16.820,00:07:19.740
to show up in the equation.,00:07:19.740,00:07:22.180
"They depend on x, in general.",00:07:22.180,00:07:25.570
"Many, many, many physical
problems look like this.",00:07:25.570,00:07:30.330
"Sort of steady-state
problems, I would say.",00:07:30.330,00:07:33.700
"I'm not talking about
Navier-Stokes fluid flow",00:07:33.700,00:07:36.330
"convection, I'm talking about
static problems, first of all.",00:07:36.330,00:07:45.340
"So here's the general idea of
the calculus of variations.",00:07:45.340,00:07:53.030
"It's the same as the
general idea of calculus.",00:07:53.030,00:07:56.050
"How do you identify a
minimum in calculus?",00:07:56.050,00:08:03.860
"If the minimum is at u,
you perturb it a little,",00:08:03.860,00:08:09.440
"by some delta u, that I'm going
to call v to have just one",00:08:09.440,00:08:15.720
letter instead of two here.,00:08:15.720,00:08:17.970
"You say OK, if I look at that
neighboring point, u plus delta",00:08:17.970,00:08:22.260
"u, my quantity is bigger.",00:08:22.260,00:08:29.490
The minimum is at u.,00:08:29.490,00:08:31.460
"So we're remembering calculus --
I guess I'm saying I've written",00:08:35.220,00:08:39.370
that here.,00:08:39.370,00:08:39.980
"Compare u with u plus
v, which you could",00:08:39.980,00:08:42.470
think of as u plus delta u.,00:08:42.470,00:08:44.920
"It's like -- v you might think
of as a small movement away",00:08:44.920,00:08:50.790
from the best function.,00:08:50.790,00:08:53.390
"In calculus it's
a small movement",00:08:53.390,00:08:55.740
away from the best point.,00:08:55.740,00:08:57.650
So let me draw the calculus.,00:08:57.650,00:09:01.300
"If you think of this blackboard
as being function space instead",00:09:01.300,00:09:04.950
"of just a blackboard, then I'm
doing calculus of variations.",00:09:04.950,00:09:08.730
"But let me just
do calculus here.",00:09:08.730,00:09:10.540
"So there's the minimum, at u.",00:09:10.540,00:09:13.330
And here is u plus v near it.,00:09:13.330,00:09:16.930
"Could be on this side or
it could be on this side.",00:09:16.930,00:09:20.740
"Those are both u plus
v. Well, you maybe",00:09:20.740,00:09:24.020
"want me to call one
of them u minus v.",00:09:24.020,00:09:26.100
"But the point is v
could have either sign.",00:09:26.100,00:09:31.870
"I'm looking at minimum
sort of inside, where I can",00:09:31.870,00:09:36.230
go to the right or the left.,00:09:36.230,00:09:39.410
So what's the deal?,00:09:39.410,00:09:41.240
"Well, that point is then that
at that point or at that point",00:09:41.240,00:09:46.090
"or at any of these other
points, P of u plus v",00:09:46.090,00:09:50.430
"is bigger then what
it is at the minimum.",00:09:50.430,00:09:54.400
"That tells us that
u is the winner.",00:09:54.400,00:09:58.110
"Now how do we get an
equation out of that?",00:09:58.110,00:10:04.040
Calculus comes in now.,00:10:04.040,00:10:05.860
"We expand this thing -- this is
some small movement away from",00:10:05.860,00:10:10.800
u.,00:10:10.800,00:10:11.890
"So we expand it, we look at
the leading term -- well,",00:10:11.890,00:10:15.220
"of course, the leading
term is P of u.",00:10:15.220,00:10:18.420
Then what is the next term?,00:10:18.420,00:10:22.730
"What's the first-order,
first variation",00:10:22.730,00:10:27.190
in P when I vary u to u plus v?,00:10:27.190,00:10:32.910
"Well, it's the whole point
of calculus, actually.",00:10:32.910,00:10:37.550
"The central point of calculus
is that this is some function",00:10:37.550,00:10:42.290
"that we call P prime of u times
v, plus order of v squared.",00:10:42.290,00:10:49.940
"When v is small, v
squared is very small.",00:10:52.960,00:10:57.420
So what's our equation?,00:10:57.420,00:10:59.640
"Well, if this has to be
bigger than P of u --",00:10:59.640,00:11:03.490
"I could just cancel P of u --
so this thing has to be bigger",00:11:03.490,00:11:07.050
equal zero now.,00:11:07.050,00:11:09.600
"I've squeezed it in a corner,
but since it's calculus",00:11:09.600,00:11:12.090
we kind of remember it.,00:11:12.090,00:11:14.580
"Also, it's easy to learn
calculus and forget",00:11:14.580,00:11:19.205
the main point.,00:11:19.205,00:11:20.460
"So this has to be
greater equal zero.",00:11:20.460,00:11:23.250
"Now this is going to
be -- if v is small,",00:11:23.250,00:11:26.530
"this is going to be very
small, so it won't help.",00:11:26.530,00:11:29.630
"So this thing had
better be zero, right?",00:11:29.630,00:11:35.910
That had better be zero.,00:11:35.910,00:11:38.750
"Because if it isn't zero, I
could take v of the right sign",00:11:38.750,00:11:42.700
"to make it positive,
and take v small, so",00:11:42.700,00:11:47.040
that this would dominate this.,00:11:47.040,00:11:48.610
"Maybe I wanted to take
v of the right sign",00:11:51.440,00:11:53.730
to make that negative anyway.,00:11:53.730,00:11:57.190
I need P prime of u to be zero.,00:11:57.190,00:12:00.930
"So that's what I end up with,
of course, as everybody knew.",00:12:00.930,00:12:04.300
"That P prime of
u had to be zero.",00:12:04.300,00:12:08.810
"So in that tiny picture,
I've remembered what we know.",00:12:08.810,00:12:13.130
"Now let me come
back to what we have",00:12:13.130,00:12:19.920
to do when we have functions.,00:12:19.920,00:12:21.310
So what happened?,00:12:23.900,00:12:26.690
"I compare P of u -- u is
now a function, u of x --",00:12:26.690,00:12:31.060
"with P of u plus v.
So I plug in u plus v,",00:12:31.060,00:12:39.360
"I compare with what
I get with only u,",00:12:39.360,00:12:42.840
and what's the difference?,00:12:42.840,00:12:44.020
"I look at the difference
and the difference",00:12:44.020,00:12:47.670
"will have a linear term from
u prime plus v prime squared",00:12:47.670,00:12:56.724
"and then I'm going to take away
the u prime squared because I",00:12:56.724,00:12:59.265
gotta compare the two.,00:12:59.265,00:13:01.070
So what's left?,00:13:01.070,00:13:02.070
"There will be a 2
u prime, v prime.",00:13:02.070,00:13:04.600
I'm maybe just being lazy here.,00:13:04.600,00:13:07.500
"I'm asking you to do
it mentally and then",00:13:07.500,00:13:09.740
I'll do it a little better.,00:13:09.740,00:13:11.720
"So the difference in
this comparison is a 2 u",00:13:11.720,00:13:15.170
"prime v prime times
c, and the 2's cancel.",00:13:15.170,00:13:18.670
"There's the difference
right there.",00:13:18.670,00:13:22.170
"What's the difference
over in this term?",00:13:22.170,00:13:24.540
"Well, I have that
term and then I",00:13:24.540,00:13:26.150
"have the same term with u plus
v, and then when I subtract,",00:13:26.150,00:13:29.370
I just have the term with v.,00:13:29.370,00:13:34.020
"So this is the dP/du that
has to be zero for every v.",00:13:34.020,00:13:46.610
"Now I'm really saying
the important thing.",00:13:46.610,00:13:49.440
"This weak form is
like saying this",00:13:49.440,00:13:56.470
"has to be zero for every
v. Then, of course,",00:13:56.470,00:14:02.990
"in this scalar case, it
was like a very small step",00:14:02.990,00:14:06.800
"to decide, well, if this
is zero for every v,",00:14:06.800,00:14:09.580
"then that's zero, which
is the strong form.",00:14:09.580,00:14:11.720
Are you with me?,00:14:15.320,00:14:16.540
"So we have a minimum
problem, minimize P,",00:14:16.540,00:14:20.190
"we have a weak form,
the first variation,",00:14:20.190,00:14:25.600
"the first derivative,
the first-order term",00:14:25.600,00:14:27.760
"has to be zero for every v. Then
if it's zero for every v, that",00:14:27.760,00:14:33.730
"forces the derivative to be
zero and that's the strong form.",00:14:33.730,00:14:39.630
"Now over here it
took more space.",00:14:39.630,00:14:47.570
"But the ultimate
idea is the same.",00:14:47.570,00:14:50.600
"We looked at P of
u plus v compared",00:14:50.600,00:14:53.550
"with P of u, subtracted,
looked at the linear term",00:14:53.550,00:14:56.480
"and there it is,
the first variation.",00:14:56.480,00:14:59.550
"That has to be zero
for every v. I'll just",00:14:59.550,00:15:05.990
"mentioned boundary
conditions now,",00:15:05.990,00:15:07.590
"as long as we're
at this weak form.",00:15:07.590,00:15:10.440
"Don't think of this weak form as
just some mathematical nonsense",00:15:10.440,00:15:15.570
"to get to the
differential equation,",00:15:15.570,00:15:17.680

foundation for the finite",00:15:17.680,00:15:20.860
"element method -- all
sorts of discrete methods,",00:15:20.860,00:15:25.730

begin with the weak form,",00:15:25.730,00:15:30.510
"the weighted integral form,
rather than the strong form.",00:15:30.510,00:15:36.980
"I was just going to say a word
about boundary conditions.",00:15:36.980,00:15:39.720
"What are the boundary
conditions on v?",00:15:39.720,00:15:41.810
"So you could say well, v stands
for a virtual displacement.",00:15:46.460,00:15:55.730
"Virtual meaning kind of
we just imagining it,",00:15:55.730,00:15:59.510
"it's a displacement that we can
imagine moving by that amount,",00:15:59.510,00:16:05.700
"but the whole point is the
nature fix the minimum.",00:16:05.700,00:16:11.690
What's the boundary condition?,00:16:11.690,00:16:12.940
"Well, all the candidates have
to satisfy these boundary",00:16:12.940,00:16:17.270
conditions.,00:16:17.270,00:16:17.900
"So I have to have u plus v
at zero also has to equal a,",00:16:17.900,00:16:22.870
"and u plus v at 1
also has to equal b,",00:16:22.870,00:16:27.050
"if I took these simple
boundary conditions.",00:16:27.050,00:16:31.370
"So, by subtraction, I learn
the boundary conditions",00:16:31.370,00:16:36.190
"on v. When I say all v, I
mean v of zero has to be what?",00:16:36.190,00:16:44.880
Zero.,00:16:44.880,00:16:46.740
"And v of 1 has to be zero --
when we had those boundary",00:16:46.740,00:16:49.800
conditions.,00:16:49.800,00:16:50.809
"Different problems could bring
different boundary conditions,",00:16:50.809,00:16:53.350
"of course, but this is
easier than -- simplest.",00:16:53.350,00:16:58.560
"So when I say all v,
I mean every function",00:16:58.560,00:17:01.350
"that starts at zero
and ends at zero",00:17:01.350,00:17:05.930
"is a candidate in
this weak form.",00:17:05.930,00:17:07.870
"I have to get the answer
zero for all those functions.",00:17:10.450,00:17:14.900
"Now somehow, I want
to get to this point,",00:17:14.900,00:17:21.320
"the differential equation, and
why don't we give it the name",00:17:21.320,00:17:27.710
"that everybody -- the two guys'
names, Euler-Lagrange -- well,",00:17:27.710,00:17:34.100
pretty famous names.,00:17:34.100,00:17:35.320
"This is the
Euler-Lagrange equation.",00:17:37.850,00:17:39.350
"So maybe before where I said
Kuhn-Tucker or something,",00:17:45.580,00:17:49.330
"if I'm talking about
differential equations,",00:17:49.330,00:17:52.060
I go back to these guys.,00:17:52.060,00:17:55.160
"Now, how did I get from
weak form to strong form?",00:17:55.160,00:18:00.720
That's a key.,00:18:00.720,00:18:03.130
"If you see these two steps
from the minimum principle",00:18:03.130,00:18:07.540
"to the weak form, that's
just, again, plug in u plus v,",00:18:07.540,00:18:13.820
"subtract and take
the linear part.",00:18:13.820,00:18:18.430
Then it's true for all v's.,00:18:18.430,00:18:22.100
"Now, how do I get
from here to here?",00:18:22.100,00:18:23.780
"Notice that this form
is an integrated form.",00:18:26.710,00:18:32.780
This form is at every point.,00:18:32.780,00:18:35.370
"So it's much stronger
and much more demanding.",00:18:35.370,00:18:39.620
"You could say OK, that
gives us the equation --",00:18:42.910,00:18:46.060
"that's the equation as
we usually see them.",00:18:46.060,00:18:49.450
"I'll do 2D and that'll be
Laplace's equation or somebody",00:18:49.450,00:18:53.060
"else's equation, but
minimal surface equation,",00:18:53.060,00:18:59.100
all sorts of equations.,00:18:59.100,00:19:00.610
Everything.,00:19:00.610,00:19:01.590
"All sorts of
applications including",00:19:01.590,00:19:04.460
this afternoon's lecture.,00:19:04.460,00:19:07.080
How to get from here to here?,00:19:07.080,00:19:08.820
"Well, there's one trick in
advanced calculus, actually.",00:19:08.820,00:19:14.440
"The most important trick
in advanced calculus",00:19:14.440,00:19:17.050
is integration by parts.,00:19:17.050,00:19:20.550
"Well, we use those words,
integration by parts,",00:19:20.550,00:19:23.070
in 1D here.,00:19:23.070,00:19:24.120
So I'll do that.,00:19:26.720,00:19:28.330
"We use maybe somebody
else's name --",00:19:28.330,00:19:30.870
"Green's formula or
Green's theorem,",00:19:30.870,00:19:33.000
"or Green-Gauss or the
divergence theorem or whatever,",00:19:33.000,00:19:39.060
in more dimensions.,00:19:39.060,00:19:40.930
"But 1D, I just
integrate by parts.",00:19:40.930,00:19:43.740
"Do you remember how
integration by parts goes?",00:19:43.740,00:19:45.760
"I want to get v by
itself, but I got v prime,",00:19:51.860,00:19:58.120
"because when I plugged in
u plus v here, out came --",00:19:58.120,00:20:02.260
"it's the derivative so
I've got a derivative.",00:20:02.260,00:20:04.920
"So how do I get rid
of a derivative?",00:20:04.920,00:20:07.250
Integrate by parts.,00:20:07.250,00:20:08.770
"Take the derivative off of v --
can I just do that this quick",00:20:08.770,00:20:12.570
way?,00:20:12.570,00:20:14.170
"Put the derivative onto
-- I almost said onto u.",00:20:14.170,00:20:19.090
"I'm doing integration by parts
and saying how important it is",00:20:22.070,00:20:25.670
but not writing out every step.,00:20:25.670,00:20:29.140
"So I take the derivative off
of this and I put it onto this,",00:20:29.140,00:20:33.260
"and it's gotta be -- and a minus
sign appears when I do that.",00:20:33.260,00:20:42.530
"Where the heck am I gonna
put that minus sign?",00:20:42.530,00:20:46.130
Right in there.,00:20:46.130,00:20:48.210
Minus.,00:20:48.210,00:20:51.950
"Then everybody knows that
there's also a boundary term,",00:20:51.950,00:20:55.060
right?,00:20:55.060,00:20:56.770
"So I have to squeeze somewhere
in this boundary term.",00:20:56.770,00:20:59.660
"So now that I've done
an integration by parts,",00:20:59.660,00:21:02.380
"the boundary term will be
the v times the c u prime",00:21:02.380,00:21:09.930
at the ends of the interval.,00:21:09.930,00:21:16.165
I think that's right.,00:21:16.165,00:21:17.040
"What we hope is
that that goes away.",00:21:24.440,00:21:28.670
"Well, of course, if it
doesn't, then we have to --",00:21:28.670,00:21:32.230
"that there's a good reason that
we don't want it to, but here",00:21:32.230,00:21:35.520
it's nice if it goes away.,00:21:35.520,00:21:37.490
"You see that it
does, because we just",00:21:37.490,00:21:40.630
"decided that the
boundary conditions on v",00:21:40.630,00:21:43.110
were zero at both ends.,00:21:43.110,00:21:48.070
"So, v being zero at both
ends kills that term.",00:21:48.070,00:21:52.900
"So now, do you see
what I have here?",00:21:52.900,00:21:55.410
"I could write it a
little more cleanly.",00:21:55.410,00:21:59.250
"The whole point is that the v --
I now have v there and I have v",00:21:59.250,00:22:02.910
"there so I can
factor v out of this.",00:22:02.910,00:22:05.180
Just put it there.,00:22:09.080,00:22:09.900
That was a good move.,00:22:14.100,00:22:15.120
"This minus sign
is still in here.",00:22:18.020,00:22:20.500
"So I now have the integral of
some function times v is zero.",00:22:20.500,00:22:28.170
That's what I'm looking for.,00:22:28.170,00:22:30.240
"The integral of some
function, some stuff, times v,",00:22:30.240,00:22:36.710
"and v can be
anything -- is zero.",00:22:36.710,00:22:40.230
What happens now?,00:22:40.230,00:22:44.200
"This integral has to
be zero for every v.",00:22:44.200,00:22:47.360
"So if this stuff had
a little bump up,",00:22:47.360,00:22:50.930
"I could take a v to
have the same bump",00:22:50.930,00:22:54.030
"and the integral
wouldn't be zero.",00:22:54.030,00:22:57.640
"So this stuff can't bump
up, it can't bump down,",00:22:57.640,00:23:01.740
it can't do anything.,00:23:01.740,00:23:02.840
"It has to be zero and
that's the strong form.",00:23:02.840,00:23:06.560
"So the strong form is with
this minus sign in there,",00:23:06.560,00:23:10.030
"minus the derivative -- see,
an extra derivative came onto",00:23:10.030,00:23:16.120
"the c u prime because
it came off the v,",00:23:16.120,00:23:20.230
"and the f was just sitting
there in the linear,",00:23:20.230,00:23:25.980
in the no derivative.,00:23:25.980,00:23:28.310
"So, do you see that pattern?",00:23:33.640,00:23:35.630
"You may have seen it before,
but calculus variations",00:23:35.630,00:23:39.060
"have sort of
disappeared as a subject",00:23:39.060,00:23:41.560
to teach in advanced calculus.,00:23:41.560,00:23:50.590
"It used to be here in courses
that Professor Hildebrand",00:23:50.590,00:23:54.110
taught.,00:23:54.110,00:23:55.420
"But actually it comes back
because we so much need",00:23:55.420,00:23:59.560
"the weak form in finite
elements and other methods.",00:23:59.560,00:24:05.600
"What I wrote over here is
the discrete equivalent.",00:24:05.600,00:24:14.250
"I can't resist looking at the
matrix form, for two reasons.",00:24:14.250,00:24:24.580
"First, it's simpler
and it copies this.",00:24:24.580,00:24:27.300
"Do you see how this
is a copy of that?",00:24:27.300,00:24:29.960
"That matrix form
is supposed to be",00:24:29.960,00:24:32.760
"exactly analogous to
this continuous form.",00:24:32.760,00:24:36.560
Why is that?,00:24:36.560,00:24:37.880
"Because u transpose f, that's
an inner product of u with f --",00:24:37.880,00:24:42.540
that's what this is.,00:24:42.540,00:24:44.040
That integral.,00:24:44.040,00:24:45.320
A*u is u prime in this analogy.,00:24:45.320,00:24:52.610
"So this is u prime times c
times u prime with the 1/2,",00:24:52.610,00:24:57.950
"and that, again, that transpose
is telling us inner product",00:24:57.950,00:25:02.711
integral.,00:25:02.711,00:25:03.210
"So if I forget u prime and
think of it as a matrix problem,",00:25:06.910,00:25:11.210
"that's my minimum
problem for matrices.",00:25:11.210,00:25:13.860
"I want to find an equation
for the winning u.",00:25:20.730,00:25:25.560
"In the end, this is
going to be the equation.",00:25:25.560,00:25:29.710
"That's the equation
that minimizes that.",00:25:29.710,00:25:31.850
"Half of 18.085 was
about this problem.",00:25:34.750,00:25:39.390
"Well, I concentrated
in 18.085 on this one,",00:25:39.390,00:25:41.979
"because minimum principles are
just that little bit trickier,",00:25:41.979,00:25:44.520
so that's 18.086.,00:25:44.520,00:25:47.160
"And then, in between,
something people seldom",00:25:47.160,00:25:52.650
"write about but, of
course, it's going to work,",00:25:52.650,00:25:55.470
"is that I change u to u plus v,
I multiply it out, I subtract,",00:25:55.470,00:26:07.070
"I look at the term linear
in v, and that's it.",00:26:07.070,00:26:09.960
"That would be if I make
that just a minus sign",00:26:14.280,00:26:18.390
"and put it all together
the way I did here,",00:26:18.390,00:26:20.650
that's the same thing.,00:26:20.650,00:26:22.900
So this is the weak form.,00:26:22.900,00:26:24.270
"This is the minimum form,
this is the weak form,",00:26:24.270,00:26:27.824
and this is the strong form.,00:26:27.824,00:26:28.990
You see that weak form?,00:26:36.900,00:26:40.020
"Somehow in the discrete case,
it's pretty clear that --",00:26:40.020,00:26:48.560
let's see.,00:26:48.560,00:26:49.290
"I could write this as --
you see, it's u transpose,",00:26:49.290,00:26:55.440
"A transpose C*A*v
equal f transpose v.",00:26:55.440,00:27:00.770
"The conclusion is if
this holds for every v,",00:27:00.770,00:27:04.280
then this is the same as this.,00:27:04.280,00:27:07.820
"If two things have the same
inner product with every vector",00:27:07.820,00:27:11.560
"v, they're the same, and
that's the strong form.",00:27:11.560,00:27:14.630
"You'd have to transpose the
whole thing, but no problem.",00:27:17.410,00:27:20.730
"So now I guess I've tried to
give the main sequence of logic",00:27:23.530,00:27:32.490
"in the continuous
case, and it's parallel",00:27:32.490,00:27:37.260
"in the discrete case
for this example.",00:27:37.260,00:27:42.020
"For this specific example
because it's the easiest.",00:27:42.020,00:27:45.320
"Let me do what Euler and
Lagrange did by extending",00:27:45.320,00:27:54.460

scalar equations.,00:43:53.820,00:43:56.480
So what's the deal?,00:43:56.480,00:43:59.180
"I've done the
integration by parts,",00:43:59.180,00:44:01.060
"so I've got everything
multiplying a v.",00:44:01.060,00:44:04.000
"So what's the strong
form of this problem?",00:44:04.000,00:44:15.020
"Well, if this integral has
to be zero for every v,",00:44:17.970,00:44:25.550
"then the conclusion is that this
stuff in the brackets is zero.",00:44:25.550,00:44:30.910
That's always the same.,00:44:30.910,00:44:33.100
That's the strong form.,00:44:33.100,00:44:36.040
"So that's Laplace's
equation or actually",00:44:36.040,00:44:38.590
"Poisson's equation because I
have a right-hand side, f of x.",00:44:38.590,00:44:41.970
"Well, those are the mechanics.",00:44:45.470,00:44:47.360
"Now, what else comes into
the calculus of variations?",00:44:47.360,00:44:55.210
You've seen the pattern here.,00:44:55.210,00:44:57.630
"There's one important
further possibility",00:44:57.630,00:45:01.560
"that we met last time,
which was constraints.",00:45:01.560,00:45:07.940
"We're dealing here with
a pure minimization.",00:45:07.940,00:45:10.320
"I didn't impose
any side conditions",00:45:13.370,00:45:17.060
"on u except maybe the
boundary condition.",00:45:17.060,00:45:21.740
"So let me give you
an example which --",00:45:21.740,00:45:27.910
"I'll just close with an example
that I'm going to follow up,",00:45:27.910,00:45:35.460
"and it's going to
have a constraint.",00:45:35.460,00:45:39.340
"So it'll look like the
original problem, but, well,",00:45:39.340,00:45:44.960
there will be two u's.,00:45:44.960,00:45:46.930
"So can I try to
get it right here?",00:45:46.930,00:45:49.510
"My minimization, my unknown
will have two components, u_1",00:45:53.740,00:46:04.580
and u_2.,00:46:04.580,00:46:05.080
And it'll be in 2D actually.,00:46:09.770,00:46:13.980
"What I'm going to produce here
is called the Stokes problem.",00:46:13.980,00:46:21.860
"I'll study it next time, so if
I run out of time, as I probably",00:46:21.860,00:46:25.270
"will, that's part of the plan.",00:46:25.270,00:46:28.020
"So it's Stokes and
not Navier-Stokes.",00:46:31.010,00:46:34.710
"All I want to do is to write
down a problem in which there",00:46:34.710,00:46:38.050
is a constraint.,00:46:38.050,00:46:40.120
"So I write it as a minimization,
say, dv_1/ d -- oh,",00:46:40.120,00:46:48.730
"probably all these
guys are in here.",00:46:48.730,00:46:50.830
"dv_1/dx and dv_1/dy and
dv_2/dx and dv_2/dy --",00:46:50.830,00:47:00.990
sorry about all this stuff.,00:47:00.990,00:47:02.470
"Probably an f_1*v --
oh, I've written v,",00:47:05.360,00:47:13.290
"because my mind is saying
that the usual notation,",00:47:13.290,00:47:16.150
"I should be writing u
because that would fit with",00:47:16.150,00:47:20.050
today's lecture.,00:47:20.050,00:47:22.120
"It's a velocity and that's
why many people call it v,",00:47:22.120,00:47:25.400
"and then they have to call
the perturbation some w.",00:47:25.400,00:47:30.450
"f_1*u_1, f_2*u_2,
all that stuff.",00:47:30.450,00:47:35.240
No problem.,00:47:35.240,00:47:36.960
"That would lead to Laplace's
equation, just the same,",00:47:36.960,00:47:39.820
Poisson's equation.,00:47:39.820,00:47:42.440
"But I'm going to
add a constraint.",00:47:42.440,00:47:47.140
"This [u 1, u 2] is a
velocity, despite the letter.",00:47:47.140,00:47:54.980
"I want to make the
material incompressible.",00:47:54.980,00:48:00.530
"I have flow here and
it's like flow of water,",00:48:00.530,00:48:06.740
probably incompressible.,00:48:06.740,00:48:09.580
"So incompressible means that
dv_1/dx plus dv_2/dx is zero.",00:48:09.580,00:48:24.042
So that's a constraint.,00:48:24.042,00:48:25.000
How the heck do we deal with it?,00:48:31.160,00:48:32.550
"So I could do this minimization
but with the constraint.",00:48:35.790,00:48:38.870
"So all this stuff I'm
totally cool with now.",00:48:45.380,00:48:50.260
"That would just be
calculus of variations,",00:48:50.260,00:48:53.310
"that would get me
the dP/du, but I have",00:48:53.310,00:48:56.130
to account for the constraint.,00:48:56.130,00:48:57.490
"So how do you account
for a constraint?",00:48:57.490,00:49:01.230
"You build it into the problem
with a Lagrange multiplier.",00:49:01.230,00:49:06.790
"So I multiply this thing by
some Lagrange multiplier,",00:49:06.790,00:49:11.140
"and as I emphasized last time,
Lagrange multipliers always",00:49:11.140,00:49:14.360
"turn out to mean
something physically,",00:49:14.360,00:49:16.940
and here it's the pressure.,00:49:16.940,00:49:18.980
"So it's natural to call the
Lagrange multiplier p of x, y.",00:49:18.980,00:49:26.650
"I build that in, so I subtract
the Lagrange multiplier",00:49:26.650,00:49:34.320
"times this thing
that has to be zero.",00:49:34.320,00:49:38.820
That gets in the problem.,00:49:38.820,00:49:42.050
"Now my function now depends
on u and the pressure.",00:49:42.050,00:49:50.380
"I'm not going to push
this to the very limit",00:49:54.690,00:50:00.420
to find the strong form.,00:50:00.420,00:50:02.520
"But the strong form is
the Stokes equations",00:50:02.520,00:50:04.940
that we'll study.,00:50:04.940,00:50:06.960
"So we have a lot to
do here to make this",00:50:06.960,00:50:12.960
"into practical calculations
where we can compute something.",00:50:12.960,00:50:18.060
"And finite elements is
a powerful way to do it.",00:50:18.060,00:50:22.560
"So we have to turn these
continuous problems",00:50:22.560,00:50:25.570
into discrete problems.,00:50:25.570,00:50:27.460
"And then, later, we have to
turn this type of problem, which",00:50:27.460,00:50:32.490
"will be a saddle point problem
because it's got this Lagrange",00:50:32.490,00:50:35.910
"multiplier in there,
into a discrete problem.",00:50:35.910,00:50:40.010
"Let me just stop by putting
the words saddle point there,",00:50:40.010,00:50:45.910
"and just as in the lecture
this afternoon, saddle points",00:50:45.910,00:50:52.690
"appear as soon as you have
constraints and Lagrange",00:50:52.690,00:50:57.190
multipliers.,00:50:57.190,00:50:59.320
"Well, thanks for your patience.",00:50:59.320,00:51:00.750
"That's a lot of material
that will quickly -- Now,",00:51:00.750,00:51:05.100
"those basic steps will be
section 7.2 and will go up",00:51:05.100,00:51:11.260
"on the web quickly, just as
soon as we get them revised.",00:51:11.260,00:51:18.160
"And I'm writing notes
on your projects",00:51:18.160,00:51:22.060
"and I hope I'll have
them ready for Friday.",00:51:22.060,00:51:25.430
"I'll aim for Friday because
Monday is Patriot's Day",00:51:25.430,00:51:29.220
"and you have to
run the marathon.",00:51:29.220,00:51:32.160
So I'll see you Friday.,00:51:32.160,00:51:33.440
Good.,00:51:33.440,00:51:33.940
Thanks.,00:51:33.940,00:51:35.190
