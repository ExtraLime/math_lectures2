"Let us now conclude with a fun
problem, which is also a",00:00:00.900,00:00:04.100
little bit of a puzzle.,00:00:04.100,00:00:05.970
"We are told that the
king comes from a",00:00:05.970,00:00:08.210
family of two children.,00:00:08.210,00:00:10.460
"What is the probability that
his sibling is female?",00:00:10.460,00:00:13.980
"Well, the problem is too loosely
stated, so we need to",00:00:13.980,00:00:17.220
"start by making some
assumptions.",00:00:17.220,00:00:19.370
"First, let's assume that we're
dealing with an anachronistic",00:00:19.370,00:00:22.800
"kingdom where boys
have precedence.",00:00:22.800,00:00:25.840
"In other words, if the royal
family has two children, one",00:00:29.930,00:00:34.640
"of which is a boy and one is a
girl, it is always the boy who",00:00:34.640,00:00:38.960
"becomes king, even if the
girl was born first.",00:00:38.960,00:00:43.830
"Let us also assume that when
a child is born, it has 50%",00:00:43.830,00:00:48.380
"probability of being
a boy and 50%",00:00:48.380,00:00:51.820
probability of being a girl.,00:00:51.820,00:00:53.320
"And in addition, let's assume
that different children are",00:00:58.890,00:01:03.790
"independent as far as their
gender is concerned.",00:01:03.790,00:01:07.195
"Given these assumptions,
perhaps we",00:01:10.070,00:01:12.850
can argue as follows.,00:01:12.850,00:01:15.240
"The king's sibling is
a child which is",00:01:15.240,00:01:18.620
independent from the king.,00:01:18.620,00:01:20.600
"Its gender is independent from
the king's gender, so it's",00:01:20.600,00:01:24.710
"going to be a girl with
probability 1/2.",00:01:24.710,00:01:29.160
"And so this is one possible
answer to this problem.",00:01:29.160,00:01:34.750
Is this a correct answer?,00:01:34.750,00:01:36.770
"Well, let's see.",00:01:36.770,00:01:37.640
"We have to make a more precise
model, so let's",00:01:37.640,00:01:40.710
go ahead with it.,00:01:40.710,00:01:42.180
"We have two children, so there
are four possible outcomes--",00:01:42.180,00:01:47.460
"boy, boy; boy, girl; girl,
boy; and girl, girl.",00:01:47.460,00:01:53.240
"Each one of these outcomes has
probability 1/4 according to",00:01:55.780,00:02:01.290
our assumptions.,00:02:01.290,00:02:02.920
"For example, the probability of
a boy followed by a boy is",00:02:02.920,00:02:05.750
"1/2 times 1/2, where we're
also using independence.",00:02:05.750,00:02:10.960
"So each one of these four
outcomes has the same",00:02:10.960,00:02:15.150
"probability, 1/4.",00:02:15.150,00:02:16.460
"Now, we know that there is a
king, so there must be at",00:02:19.660,00:02:23.740
least one boy.,00:02:23.740,00:02:25.720
"Given this information, one
of the outcomes becomes",00:02:25.720,00:02:30.560
"impossible, namely the
outcome girl, girl.",00:02:30.560,00:02:35.050
"And we're restricted to a
smaller universe with only",00:02:35.050,00:02:39.150
three possible outcomes.,00:02:39.150,00:02:41.620
"Our new universe is this green
universe, which includes all",00:02:41.620,00:02:45.470
"outcomes that have at least
one boy, so that",00:02:45.470,00:02:48.100
we can get a king.,00:02:48.100,00:02:50.930
"We should, therefore, use the
conditional probabilities that",00:02:50.930,00:02:54.530
"are appropriate to this
new universe.",00:02:54.530,00:02:57.590
"Since these three outcomes
inside the green set have",00:02:57.590,00:03:01.920
"equal unconditional
probabilities, they should",00:03:01.920,00:03:05.170
"also have equal conditional
probabilities.",00:03:05.170,00:03:08.460
"So each one of these three
outcomes should have a",00:03:08.460,00:03:12.230
"conditional probability
equal to 1/3.",00:03:12.230,00:03:14.460
"In two of these outcomes the
sibling is a girl and",00:03:17.079,00:03:21.340
"therefore, the conditional
probability given that there",00:03:21.340,00:03:25.275
"is a king and therefore given
that there is a boy, the",00:03:25.275,00:03:28.930
"conditional probability
is going to be 2/3.",00:03:28.930,00:03:34.570
"So this is actually the official
answer to this",00:03:34.570,00:03:37.680
"problem, and this answer
is incorrect.",00:03:37.680,00:03:40.710
"Are we satisfied with
this answer?",00:03:43.610,00:03:45.960
"Maybe yes, maybe no.",00:03:45.960,00:03:48.760
"Actually, some more assumptions
are needed in",00:03:48.760,00:03:52.579
"order to say that 2/3 is
the correct answer.",00:03:52.579,00:03:56.290
"Let me state what these
assumptions are.",00:03:56.290,00:04:00.160
"We assume that the royal family
decided to have exactly",00:04:00.160,00:04:04.960
two children.,00:04:04.960,00:04:06.830
"So the number two that we
have here is not random.",00:04:06.830,00:04:11.900
"It was something that
was predetermined.",00:04:11.900,00:04:14.760
"Once they decided to have the
two children, they had them.",00:04:14.760,00:04:20.140
"At least one turned out
to be a boy and that",00:04:20.140,00:04:23.720
boy became a king.,00:04:23.720,00:04:26.460
"Under this situation, indeed,
the probability that the",00:04:26.460,00:04:30.780
"sibling of the king
is female is 2/3.",00:04:30.780,00:04:36.540
"But these assumptions that I
just stated are not the only",00:04:36.540,00:04:39.760
possible ones.,00:04:39.760,00:04:41.840
"Let's consider some alternative
assumptions.",00:04:41.840,00:04:46.040
"For example, suppose
that the royal",00:04:46.040,00:04:48.190
family operated as follows.,00:04:48.190,00:04:51.110
"They decided to have children
until they get one boy.",00:04:51.110,00:04:56.930
What does this tell us?,00:05:00.820,00:05:02.610
"Well, since they had two
children, this tells us",00:05:02.610,00:05:06.080
something--,00:05:06.080,00:05:06.660
"that the first child
was a girl.",00:05:06.660,00:05:10.300
"So in this case, the probability
that the king's",00:05:13.170,00:05:16.110
"sibling is a girl
is equal to 1.",00:05:16.110,00:05:20.340
"The only reason why they had two
children was because the",00:05:20.340,00:05:23.350
"first was a girl and then
the second was a boy.",00:05:23.350,00:05:27.570
"Suppose that the royal family
made some different choices.",00:05:27.570,00:05:30.890
"They decided to have children
until they would get two boys,",00:05:30.890,00:05:36.670
"just to be sure that the line
of succession was secured.",00:05:36.670,00:05:41.190
"In this case, if we are told
that there are only two",00:05:41.190,00:05:45.520
"children, this means that there
were exactly two boys,",00:05:45.520,00:05:51.460
"because if one of the two
children was a girl, the royal",00:05:51.460,00:05:54.220
family would have continued.,00:05:54.220,00:05:56.170
"So in this particular case,
the probability that the",00:05:56.170,00:05:59.720
"sibling is a girl is
equal to zero.",00:05:59.720,00:06:02.970
"And you can think of other
scenarios, as well, that might",00:06:02.970,00:06:05.970
give you different answers.,00:06:05.970,00:06:09.610
"So 2/3 is the official answer,
as long as we make the precise",00:06:09.610,00:06:15.330
"assumptions that the number of
children, the number two, was",00:06:15.330,00:06:19.120
"predetermined before anything
else happened.",00:06:19.120,00:06:24.280
"The general moral from this
story is that when we deal",00:06:24.280,00:06:27.070
"with situations that are
described in words somewhat",00:06:27.070,00:06:30.440
"vaguely, we must be very careful
to state whatever",00:06:30.440,00:06:34.010
assumptions are being made.,00:06:34.010,00:06:36.090
"And that needs to be done before
we are able to fix a",00:06:36.090,00:06:39.909
"particular probabilistic
model.",00:06:39.909,00:06:43.050
"This process of modeling will
always be something of an art",00:06:43.050,00:06:47.710
"in which judgment calls
will have to be made.",00:06:47.710,00:06:50.590
