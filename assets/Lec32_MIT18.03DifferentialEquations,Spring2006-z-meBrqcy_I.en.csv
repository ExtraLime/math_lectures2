"First of all,
the way a nonlinear autonomous",00:00:08.000,00:00:11.638
"system looks,
you have had some practice with",00:00:11.638,00:00:15.361
"it by now.
This is nonlinear.",00:00:15.361,00:00:17.730
"The right-hand side are no
longer simple combinations ax",00:00:17.730,00:00:22.384
"plus by.
Nonlinear and autonomous,",00:00:22.384,00:00:26.192
"these are function just of x
and y.",00:00:26.192,00:00:30.000
"There is no t on the right-hand
side.",00:00:30.000,00:00:33.789
"Now, most of today will be
geometric.",00:00:33.789,00:00:37.578
"The way to get a geometric
picture of that is first by",00:00:37.578,00:00:43.157
"constructing the velocity field
whose components are the",00:00:43.157,00:00:48.947
"functions f and g.
This is a velocity field that",00:00:48.947,00:00:53.894
"gives a picture of the system
and has solutions.",00:00:53.894,00:01:00.000
"The solutions to the system,
from the point of view of",00:01:00.000,00:01:05.120
"functions, they would look like
pairs of functions,",00:01:05.120,00:01:09.950
"x of t, y of t.",00:01:09.950,00:01:12.751
"But, from the point of view of
geometry, when you plot them as",00:01:12.751,00:01:18.644
"parametric equations,
they are called trajectories of",00:01:18.644,00:01:23.668
"the field F, which simply means
that they are curves everywhere",00:01:23.668,00:01:29.657
"having the right velocity.
So a typical curve would look",00:01:29.657,00:01:34.971
"like --
There is a trajectory.",00:01:34.971,00:01:38.497
"And we know it is a trajectory
because at each point the vector",00:01:38.497,00:01:42.715
"on it has, of course,
the right direction,",00:01:42.715,00:01:45.505
"the tangent direction,
but more than that,",00:01:45.505,00:01:48.295
"it has the right velocity.
So here, for example,",00:01:48.295,00:01:51.494
"the point is traveling more
slowly.",00:01:51.494,00:01:53.807
"Here it is traveling more
rapidly because the velocity",00:01:53.807,00:01:57.414
"vector is bigger,
longer.",00:01:57.414,00:02:00.000
"So this is a picture of a
typical trajectory.",00:02:00.000,00:02:03.955
"The only other things that I
should mention are the critical",00:02:03.955,00:02:09.258
"points.
If you have worked the problems",00:02:09.258,00:02:12.674
"for this week,
the first couple of problems,",00:02:12.674,00:02:16.539
"you have already seen the
significance of the critical",00:02:16.539,00:02:21.303
"points.
Well, from Monday's lecture you",00:02:21.303,00:02:24.719
"know from the point of view of
solutions they are constant",00:02:24.719,00:02:29.842
solutions.,00:02:29.842,00:02:32.000
"From the point of view of the
field they are where the field",00:02:37.000,00:02:41.224
"is zero.
There is no velocity vector,",00:02:41.224,00:02:43.801
"in other words.
The velocity vector is zero.",00:02:43.801,00:02:46.880
"And, therefore,
a point being there has no",00:02:46.880,00:02:49.816
"reason to go anywhere else.
And, spelling it out,",00:02:49.816,00:02:53.252
"it's where the partial
derivatives, where the values of",00:02:53.252,00:02:57.119
"the functions on the right-hand
side, which give the two",00:02:57.119,00:03:01.057
"components, the i and j
components of the field,",00:03:01.057,00:03:04.422
where they are zero.,00:03:04.422,00:03:07.000
"That is all I will need by way
of a recall today.",00:03:11.000,00:03:14.645
"I don't think I will need
anything else.",00:03:14.645,00:03:17.607
"The topic for today is another
kind of behavior that you have",00:03:17.607,00:03:22.164
"not yet observed at the computer
screen, unless you have worked",00:03:22.164,00:03:26.873
"ahead, and that is there are
trajectories which go along to",00:03:26.873,00:03:31.278
"infinity or end up at a critical
point.",00:03:31.278,00:03:35.000
"They are the critical points
that just sit there all the",00:03:35.000,00:03:39.631
"time.
But there is a third type of",00:03:39.631,00:03:42.410
"behavior that a trajectory can
have where it neither sits for",00:03:42.410,00:03:47.463
"all time nor goes off for all
time.",00:03:47.463,00:03:50.326
"Instead, it repeats itself.
Such a thing is called a closed",00:03:50.326,00:03:55.210
"trajectory.
What does it look like?",00:03:55.210,00:03:59.000
"Well, it is a closed curve in
the plane that at every point,",00:03:59.000,00:04:05.051
"it is a trajectory,
i.e., the arrows at each point,",00:04:05.051,00:04:10.179
"let's say it is traced in the
clockwise direction.",00:04:10.179,00:04:15.205
"And so the arrows of the field
will go like this.",00:04:15.205,00:04:20.128
"Here it is going slowly,
here it is very slow and here",00:04:20.128,00:04:25.564
"it picks up a little speed again
and so on.",00:04:25.564,00:04:31.000
"Now, for such a trajectory what
is happening?",00:04:31.000,00:04:35.938
"Well, it goes around in finite
time and then repeats itself.",00:04:35.938,00:04:42.561
"It just goes round and round
forever if you land on that",00:04:42.561,00:04:48.734
"trajectory.
It represents a system that",00:04:48.734,00:04:53.000
"returns to its original state
periodically.",00:04:53.000,00:04:57.714
"It represents periodic behavior
of the system.",00:04:57.714,00:05:04.000
"Now, we have seen one example
of that, a simple example where",00:05:16.000,00:05:23.651
"this simple system,
x prime equals y,",00:05:23.651,00:05:29.644
y prime equals negative x.,00:05:29.644,00:05:35.000
"We could write down the
solutions to that directly,",00:05:40.000,00:05:43.521
"but if you want to do
eigenvalues and eigenvectors the",00:05:43.521,00:05:47.253
"matrix will look like this.
The equation will be lambda",00:05:47.253,00:05:51.056
"squared plus zero lambda plus
one equals zero,",00:05:51.056,00:05:55.070
so the eigenvalues will be plus,00:05:55.070,00:05:58.521
"or minus i.
In fact, from then on you could",00:05:58.521,00:06:02.084
"work out in the usual ways the
eigenvectors,",00:06:02.084,00:06:04.976
"complex eigenvectors and
separate them.",00:06:04.976,00:06:07.531
"But, look, you can avoid all
that just by writing down the",00:06:07.531,00:06:11.364
"solution.
The solutions are sines and",00:06:11.364,00:06:13.785
"cosines.
One basic solution will be x",00:06:13.785,00:06:16.206
"equals cosine t,
in which case what is y?",00:06:16.206,00:06:19.904
"Well, y is the derivative of
that.",00:06:19.904,00:06:22.123
That will be minus sine t.,00:06:22.123,00:06:24.880
"Another basic solution,
we will start with x equals",00:06:24.880,00:06:28.242
"sine t.
In which case y will be cosine",00:06:28.242,00:06:33.861
"t, its derivative.",00:06:33.861,00:06:36.914
"Now, if you do that,
what do these things look like?",00:06:36.914,00:06:41.779
"Well, either of these two basic
solutions looks like a circle,",00:06:41.779,00:06:47.598
"not traced in the usual way but
in the opposite way.",00:06:47.598,00:06:52.463
"For example,
when t is equal to zero it",00:06:52.463,00:06:56.088
"starts at the point one,
zero.",00:06:56.088,00:07:00.000
"Now, if the minus sign were not
there this would be x equals",00:07:00.000,00:07:04.224
"cosine t,
y equals sine t,",00:07:04.224,00:07:08.162
"which is the usual
counterclockwise circle.",00:07:08.162,00:07:11.169
"But if I change y from sine t
to negative sine t",00:07:11.169,00:07:15.465
"it is going around the
other way.",00:07:15.465,00:07:18.472
"So this circle is traced that
way.",00:07:18.472,00:07:20.835
"And this is a family of
circles, according to the values",00:07:20.835,00:07:24.773
"of c1 and c2,
concentric, all of which go",00:07:24.773,00:07:27.637
"around clockwise.
So those are closed",00:07:27.637,00:07:31.330
"trajectories.
Those are the solutions.",00:07:31.330,00:07:33.921
"They are trajectories of the
vector field.",00:07:33.921,00:07:36.792
"They are closed.
They come around and they",00:07:36.792,00:07:39.663
"repeat in finite time.
Now, these are no good.",00:07:39.663,00:07:42.815
"These are the kind I am not
interested in.",00:07:42.815,00:07:45.686
"These are commonplace,
and we are interested in good",00:07:45.686,00:07:49.257
"stuff today.
And the good stuff we are",00:07:49.257,00:07:51.848
interested in is limit cycles.,00:07:51.848,00:07:55.000
"A limit cycle is a closed
trajectory with a couple of",00:08:01.000,00:08:06.185
"extra hypotheses.
It is a closed trajectory,",00:08:06.185,00:08:10.472
"just like those guys,
but it has something they don't",00:08:10.472,00:08:15.658
"have, namely,
it is king of the roost.",00:08:15.658,00:08:19.347
"They have to be isolated,
no other guys nearby.",00:08:19.347,00:08:23.934
"And they also have to be
stable.",00:08:23.934,00:08:27.025
"See, the problem here is that
none of these stands out from",00:08:27.025,00:08:32.809
"any of the others.
In other words,",00:08:32.809,00:08:37.406
"there must be,
isolated means,",00:08:37.406,00:08:40.125
no others nearby.,00:08:40.125,00:08:42.000
"That is just what goes wrong
here.",00:08:49.000,00:08:51.506
"Arbitrarily close to each of
these circles is yet another",00:08:51.506,00:08:55.759
"circle doing exactly the same
thing.",00:08:55.759,00:08:58.417
"That means that there are some
that are only of mild interest.",00:08:58.417,00:09:03.050
"What is much more interesting
is to find a cycle where there",00:09:03.050,00:09:07.531
"is nothing nearby.
Something, therefore,",00:09:07.531,00:09:10.493
that looks like this.,00:09:10.493,00:09:13.000
"Here is our pink guy.
Let's make this one go",00:09:22.000,00:09:25.405
"counterclockwise.
Here is a limit cycle,",00:09:25.405,00:09:28.495
"it seems to be.
And now what do nearby guys do?",00:09:28.495,00:09:33.089
"Well, they should approach it.
Somebody here like that does",00:09:33.089,00:09:38.870
"this, spirals in and gets ever
and every closer to that thing.",00:09:38.870,00:09:44.950
"Now, it can never join it
because, if it joined it at the",00:09:44.950,00:09:50.531
"joining point,
I would have two solutions",00:09:50.531,00:09:54.518
"going through this point.
And that is illegal.",00:09:54.518,00:10:00.000
"All it can do is get
arbitrarily close.",00:10:00.000,00:10:02.727
"On the computer screen it will
look as if it joins it but,",00:10:02.727,00:10:06.818
"of course, it cannot.
It is just the resolution,",00:10:06.818,00:10:10.191
"the pixels.
Not enough pixels.",00:10:10.191,00:10:12.272
"The resolution isn't good
enough.",00:10:12.272,00:10:14.569
"And the ones that start further
away will take longer to find",00:10:14.569,00:10:18.875
"their way to the limit cycle and
they will always stay outside of",00:10:18.875,00:10:23.468
"the earlier guys,
but they will get arbitrarily",00:10:23.468,00:10:26.770
"close, too.
How about inside?",00:10:26.770,00:10:30.000
"Inside, well,
it starts somewhere and does",00:10:30.000,00:10:33.517
"the same thing.
It starts here and will try to",00:10:33.517,00:10:37.378
"join the limit cycle.
That is what I mean by",00:10:37.378,00:10:41.067
"stability.
Stability means that nearby",00:10:41.067,00:10:44.241
"guys, the guys that start
somewhere else eventually",00:10:44.241,00:10:48.530
"approach the limit cycle,
regardless of whether they",00:10:48.530,00:10:52.906
"start from the outside or start
from the inside.",00:10:52.906,00:10:56.938
"So that is stable.
An unstable limit cycle --",00:10:56.938,00:11:02.000
"But I am not calling it a limit
cycle if it is unstable.",00:11:02.000,00:11:06.078
"I am just calling it a closed
trajectory, but let's draw one",00:11:06.078,00:11:10.454
"which is unstable.
Here is the way we will look if",00:11:10.454,00:11:14.088
"it is unstable.
Guys that start nearby will be",00:11:14.088,00:11:17.425
"repelled, driven somewhere else.
Or, if they start here,",00:11:17.425,00:11:21.504
"they will go away from the
thing instead of going toward",00:11:21.504,00:11:25.583
"it.
This is unstable.",00:11:25.583,00:11:27.066
"And I don't call it a limit
cycle.",00:11:27.066,00:11:29.514
It is just a closed trajectory.,00:11:29.514,00:11:33.000
"Cycle because it cycles round
and round.",00:11:38.000,00:11:40.902
"Limit because it is the limit
of the nearby curves.",00:11:40.902,00:11:44.624
"The other case where it is
unstable is not the limit.",00:11:44.624,00:11:48.495
"Of course, you could have a
case also where the curves",00:11:48.495,00:11:52.440
"outside spiral in toward it but
the ones inside are repelled and",00:11:52.440,00:11:57.129
"do this.
That would be called",00:11:57.129,00:11:59.213
"semi-stable.
And you can make up all sorts",00:11:59.213,00:12:03.261
"of cases.
And I think I,",00:12:03.261,00:12:05.055
"at one point,
drew them in the notes,",00:12:05.055,00:12:07.863
"but I am not going to.
The only interesting one,",00:12:07.863,00:12:11.529
"of permanent importance that
people study,",00:12:11.529,00:12:14.727
"are the actual limit cycles.
No, it was the stable closed",00:12:14.727,00:12:19.094
"trajectories.
Notice, by the way,",00:12:19.094,00:12:21.590
"a closed trajectory is always a
simple curve.",00:12:21.590,00:12:25.022
"Remember what that means from
18.02?",00:12:25.022,00:12:29.000
"Simple means it doesn't cross
itself.",00:12:29.000,00:12:32.335
"Why doesn't it cross itself?
It cannot cross itself because,",00:12:32.335,00:12:37.801
"if it tried to,
what is wrong with that point?",00:12:37.801,00:12:41.970
"At that point which way does
the vector field go,",00:12:41.970,00:12:46.416
"that way or that way?
Why the interest of limit",00:12:46.416,00:12:50.678
"cycles?
Well, because there are systems",00:12:50.678,00:12:54.198
"in nature in which just this
type of behavior,",00:12:54.198,00:12:58.367
"they have a certain periodic
motion.",00:12:58.367,00:13:03.000
"And, if you disturb it,
gradually it returns to its",00:13:03.000,00:13:07.128
"original periodic state.
A simple example is breathing.",00:13:07.128,00:13:11.587
"Now I have made you all
self-conscious.",00:13:11.587,00:13:14.724
"All of you are breathing.
If you are here you are",00:13:14.724,00:13:18.688
"breathing.
At what rate are you breathing?",00:13:18.688,00:13:22.073
"Well, you are unaware of it,
of course, except now.",00:13:22.073,00:13:26.201
"If you are sitting here
listening.",00:13:26.201,00:13:30.000
"There is a certain temperature
and a certain air circulation in",00:13:30.000,00:13:34.248
"the room.
You are not thinking of",00:13:34.248,00:13:36.441
"anything, certainly not of the
lecture, and the lecture is not",00:13:36.441,00:13:40.621
"unduly exciting,
you will breathe at a certain",00:13:40.621,00:13:43.705
"steady rate which is a little
different for every person but",00:13:43.705,00:13:47.748
"that is your rate.
Now, you can artificially",00:13:47.748,00:13:50.695
"change that.
You could say now I am going to",00:13:50.695,00:13:53.642
"breathe faster.
And indeed you can.",00:13:53.642,00:13:57.000
"But, as soon as you stop being
aware of what you are doing,",00:13:57.000,00:14:01.917
"the levels of various hormones
and carbon dioxide in your",00:14:01.917,00:14:06.665
"bloodstream and so on will
return your breathing to its",00:14:06.665,00:14:11.244
"natural state.
In other words,",00:14:11.244,00:14:13.703
"that system of your breathing,
which is controlled by various",00:14:13.703,00:14:18.790
"chemicals and hormones in the
body, is exhibiting exactly this",00:14:18.790,00:14:23.962
"type of behavior.
It has a certain regular",00:14:23.962,00:14:27.438
"periodic motion as a system.
And, if disturbed,",00:14:27.438,00:14:32.120
"if artificially you set it out
somewhere else,",00:14:32.120,00:14:34.921
"it will gradually return to its
original state.",00:14:34.921,00:14:37.785
"Now, of course,
if I am running it will be",00:14:37.785,00:14:40.337
"different.
Sure.",00:14:40.337,00:14:41.271
"If you are running you breathe
faster, but that is because the",00:14:41.271,00:14:45.068
"parameters in the system,
the a's and the b's in the",00:14:45.068,00:14:48.242
"equation, the f of (x,
y) and g of (x,",00:14:48.242,00:14:50.546
"y), the parameters in those",00:14:50.546,00:14:53.658
"functions will be set at
different levels.",00:14:53.658,00:14:56.210
"You will have different
hormones, a different of carbon",00:14:56.210,00:14:59.572
"dioxide and so on.
Now, I am not saying that",00:14:59.572,00:15:04.056
"breathing is modeled by a limit
cycle.",00:15:04.056,00:15:07.100
"It is the sort of thing which
one might look for a limit",00:15:07.100,00:15:11.624
"cycle.
That is, of course,",00:15:11.624,00:15:13.681
"a question for biologists.
And, in general,",00:15:13.681,00:15:17.136
"any type of periodic behavior
in nature, people try to see if",00:15:17.136,00:15:22.071
"there is some system of
differential equations which",00:15:22.071,00:15:26.267
"governs it in which perhaps
there is a limit cycle,",00:15:26.267,00:15:30.380
"which contains a limit cycle.
Well, what are the problems?",00:15:30.380,00:15:36.467
"In a sense, limit cycles are
easy to lecture about because so",00:15:36.467,00:15:41.755
"little is known about them.
At the end of the period,",00:15:41.755,00:15:46.338
"if I have time,
I will show you that the",00:15:46.338,00:15:49.776
"simplest possible question you
could ask, the answer to it is",00:15:49.776,00:15:55.064
"totally known after 120 years of
steady trying.",00:15:55.064,00:16:00.000
"But let's first talk about what
sorts of problems people address",00:16:00.000,00:16:05.163
"with limit cycles.
First of all is the existence",00:16:05.163,00:16:09.016
problem.,00:16:09.016,00:16:10.000
"If I give you a system,
you know, the right-hand side",00:16:16.000,00:16:19.436
"is x squared plus 2y cubed minus
3xy,",00:16:19.436,00:16:23.202
"and the g is something similar.
I say does this have limit",00:16:23.202,00:16:26.969
"cycles?
Well, you know how to find its",00:16:26.969,00:16:29.414
"critical points.
But how do you find out if it",00:16:29.414,00:16:34.797
"has limit cycles?
The answer to that is nobody",00:16:34.797,00:16:40.690
"has any idea.
This problem,",00:16:40.690,00:16:44.095
"in general, there are not much
in the way of methods.",00:16:44.095,00:16:50.904
Not much.,00:16:50.904,00:16:53.000
"Not much is known.
There is one theorem that you",00:17:00.000,00:17:03.660
"will find in the notes,
a simple theorem called the",00:17:03.660,00:17:07.555
"Poincare-Bendixson theorem
which, for about 60 or 70 years",00:17:07.555,00:17:11.994
"was about the only result known
which enabled people to find",00:17:11.994,00:17:16.590
"limit cycles.
Nowadays the theorem is used",00:17:16.590,00:17:19.783
"relatively little because people
try to find limit cycles by",00:17:19.783,00:17:24.379
"computer.
Now, the difficulty is you have",00:17:24.379,00:17:27.494
"to know where to look for them.
In other words,",00:17:27.494,00:17:32.062
"the computer screen shows that
much and you set the axes and it",00:17:32.062,00:17:36.454
"doesn't show any limit cycles.
That doesn't mean there are not",00:17:36.454,00:17:40.775
"any.
That means they are over there,",00:17:40.775,00:17:43.254
"or it means there is a big one
like there.",00:17:43.254,00:17:46.158
"And you are looking in the
middle of it and don't see it.",00:17:46.158,00:17:50.125
"So, in general,
people don't look for limit",00:17:50.125,00:17:53.099
"cycles unless the physical
system that gave rise to the",00:17:53.099,00:17:56.924
"pair of differential equations
suggests that there is something",00:17:56.924,00:18:01.316
"repetitive going on like
breathing.",00:18:01.316,00:18:05.000
"And, if it tells you that,
then it often gives you",00:18:05.000,00:18:09.281
"approximate values of the
parameters and the variables so",00:18:09.281,00:18:14.174
"you know where to look.
Basically this is done by",00:18:14.174,00:18:18.368
"computer search guided by the
physical problem.",00:18:18.368,00:18:23.000
"Therefore, I cannot say much
more about it today.",00:18:31.000,00:18:35.495
"Instead I am going to focus my
attention on nonexistence.",00:18:35.495,00:18:40.740
"When can you be sure that a
system will not have any limit",00:18:40.740,00:18:46.078
"cycles?
And there are two theorems.",00:18:46.078,00:18:49.262
"One, again, due to Bendixson
who was a Swedish mathematician",00:18:49.262,00:18:54.788
"who lived around 1900 or so.
There is a criterion due to",00:18:54.788,00:18:59.939
"Bendixson.
And there is one involving",00:18:59.939,00:19:04.277
"critical points.
And I would like to describe",00:19:04.277,00:19:08.131
"both of them for you today.
First of all,",00:19:08.131,00:19:11.635
Bendixson's criterion.,00:19:11.635,00:19:14.000
"It is very simply stated and
has a marvelous proof,",00:19:22.000,00:19:25.418
"which I am going to give you.
We have D as a region of the",00:19:25.418,00:19:29.316
plane.,00:19:29.316,00:19:30.000
"And what Bendixson's criterion
tells you to do is take your",00:19:35.000,00:19:40.080
"vector field and calculate its
divergence.",00:19:40.080,00:19:43.671
"We are set back in 1802,
and this proof is going to be",00:19:43.671,00:19:48.313
"straight 18.02.
You will enjoy it.",00:19:48.313,00:19:51.204
"Calculate the divergence.
Now, I am talking about the",00:19:51.204,00:19:55.759
"two-dimensional divergence.
Remember that is fx,",00:19:55.759,00:20:00.671
"the partial of f with respect
to x, plus the partial of the g,",00:20:00.671,00:20:05.768
"the j component with respect to
y.",00:20:05.768,00:20:08.525
"And assume that that is a
continuous function.",00:20:08.525,00:20:12.285
"It always will be with us.
Practically all the examples I",00:20:12.285,00:20:16.964
"will give you f and g will be
simple polynomials.",00:20:16.964,00:20:20.975
"They are smooth,
continuous and nice and behave",00:20:20.975,00:20:24.819
"as you want.
And you calculate that and",00:20:24.819,00:20:27.994
"assume --
Suppose, in other words,",00:20:27.994,00:20:32.415
"that the divergence of f,
I need more room.",00:20:32.415,00:20:36.641
"The hypothesis is that the
divergence of f is not zero in",00:20:36.641,00:20:42.276
"that region D.
It is never zero.",00:20:42.276,00:20:45.396
"It is not zero at any point in
that region.",00:20:45.396,00:20:49.622
"The conclusion is that there
are no limit cycles in the",00:20:49.622,00:20:55.056
"region.
If it is not zero in D,",00:20:55.056,00:20:58.075
"there are no limit cycles.
In fact, there are not even any",00:20:58.075,00:21:04.844
"closed trajectories.
You couldn't even have those",00:21:04.844,00:21:09.250
"bunch of concentric circles,
so there are no closed",00:21:09.250,00:21:13.838
"trajectories of the original
system whose divergence you",00:21:13.838,00:21:18.886
"calculated.
There are no closed",00:21:18.886,00:21:21.639
"trajectories in D.
For example,",00:21:21.639,00:21:24.392
"let me give you a simple
example to put a little flesh on",00:21:24.392,00:21:29.531
"it.
Let's see.",00:21:29.531,00:21:32.057
"What do I have?
I prepared an example.",00:21:32.057,00:21:35.971
"x prime equals,
here is a simple nonlinear",00:21:35.971,00:21:40.307
"system, x cubed plus y cubed.",00:21:40.307,00:21:45.278
"And y prime equals 3x plus y
cubed plus 2y.",00:21:45.278,00:21:51.519
"Does this system have limit
cycles?",00:21:59.000,00:22:01.604
"Well, even to calculate its
critical points would be a",00:22:01.604,00:22:05.665
"little task, but we can easily
answer the question as to",00:22:05.665,00:22:09.879
"whether it has limit cycles or
not by Bendixson's criterion.",00:22:09.879,00:22:14.399
"Let's calculate the divergence.
The divergence of the vector",00:22:14.399,00:22:18.919
"field whose components are these
two functions is,",00:22:18.919,00:22:22.673
"well, 3x squared,
it's the partial of the first",00:22:22.673,00:22:26.887
"guy with respect to x plus the
partial of the second guy with",00:22:26.887,00:22:31.483
"respect to y,
which is 3y squared plus two.",00:22:31.483,00:22:34.625
"Now, can that be zero anywhere",00:22:34.625,00:22:39.654
"in the x,y-plane?
No, because it is the sum of",00:22:39.654,00:22:43.635
"these two squares.
This much of it could be zero",00:22:43.635,00:22:47.793
"only at the origin,
but that plus two eliminates",00:22:47.793,00:22:51.951
"even that.
This is always positive in the",00:22:51.951,00:22:55.490
"entire x,y-plane.
Here my domain is the whole",00:22:55.490,00:22:59.383
"x,y-plane and,
therefore, the conclusion is",00:22:59.383,00:23:03.099
"that there are no closed
trajectories in the x,y-plane,",00:23:03.099,00:23:07.876
anywhere.,00:23:07.876,00:23:10.000
"And we have done that with just
a couple of lines of calculation",00:23:15.000,00:23:18.566
"and nothing further required.
No computer search.",00:23:18.566,00:23:21.283
"In fact, no computer search
could ever proof this.",00:23:21.283,00:23:24.056
"It would be impossible because,
no matter where you look,",00:23:24.056,00:23:27.226
"there is always some other
place to look.",00:23:27.226,00:23:30.000
"This is an example where a
couple lines of mathematics",00:23:30.000,00:23:35.404
"dispose of the matter far more
effectively than a million",00:23:35.404,00:23:41.115
"dollars worth of calculation.
Well, where does Bendixson's",00:23:41.115,00:23:46.927
"theorem come from?
Yes, Bendixson's theorem comes",00:23:46.927,00:23:51.822
"from 18.02.
And I am giving it to you both",00:23:51.822,00:23:56.003
"to recall a little bit of 18.02
to you.",00:23:56.003,00:24:01.000
"Because it is about the first
example in the course that we",00:24:01.000,00:24:06.272
"have had of an indirect
argument.",00:24:06.272,00:24:09.181
"And indirect arguments are
something you have to slowly get",00:24:09.181,00:24:14.454
"used to.
I am going to give you an",00:24:14.454,00:24:17.454
"indirect proof.
Remember what that is?",00:24:17.454,00:24:20.818
"You assume the contrary and you
show it leads to a",00:24:20.818,00:24:25.272
"contradiction.
What would assuming the",00:24:25.272,00:24:28.636
"contrary be?
Contrary would be I will assume",00:24:28.636,00:24:34.335
"the divergence is not zero,
but I will suppose there is a",00:24:34.335,00:24:40.360
"closed trajectory.
Suppose there is a closed",00:24:40.360,00:24:44.987
trajectory that exists.,00:24:44.987,00:24:48.000
Let's draw a picture of it.,00:24:56.000,00:24:59.000
"And let's say it goes around
this way.",00:25:08.000,00:25:11.243
"There is a closed trajectory
for our system.",00:25:11.243,00:25:15.011
"Let's call the curve C.
And I am going to call the",00:25:15.011,00:25:19.306
"inside of it R,
the way one often does in",00:25:19.306,00:25:22.812
"18.02.
D is all this region out here,",00:25:22.812,00:25:25.968
"in which everything is taking
place.",00:25:25.968,00:25:30.000
"This is to exist in D.
Now, what I am going to do is",00:25:30.000,00:25:35.257
"calculate a line integral around
that curve.",00:25:35.257,00:25:40.000
"A line integral of this vector
field.",00:25:45.000,00:25:47.825
"Now, there are two things you
can calculate.",00:25:47.825,00:25:51.201
"One of the line integrals,
I will put in a few of the",00:25:51.201,00:25:55.283
"vectors here.
The vectors I know are pointing",00:25:55.283,00:25:58.737
"this way because that is the
direction in which the curve is",00:25:58.737,00:26:03.368
"being traversed in order to make
it a trajectory.",00:26:03.368,00:26:08.000
"Those are a few of the typical
vectors in the field.",00:26:08.000,00:26:12.087
"I am going to calculate the
line integral around that curve",00:26:12.087,00:26:16.735
"in the positive sense.
In other words,",00:26:16.735,00:26:19.700
"not in the direction of the
salmon-colored arrow,",00:26:19.700,00:26:23.547
"but in the normal sense in
which you calculate it using",00:26:23.547,00:26:27.874
"Green's theorem,
for example.",00:26:27.874,00:26:31.000
"The positive sense means the
one which keeps the region,",00:26:31.000,00:26:34.752
"the inside on your left,
as you walk around like that",00:26:34.752,00:26:38.301
"the region stays on your left.
That is the positive sense.",00:26:38.301,00:26:42.190
"That is the sense in which I am
integrating.",00:26:42.190,00:26:45.124
"I am going to use Green's
theorem, but the integral that I",00:26:45.124,00:26:49.014
"am going to calculate is not the
work integral.",00:26:49.014,00:26:52.152
"I am going to calculate instead
the flux integral,",00:26:52.152,00:26:55.496
"the integral that represents
the flux of F across C.",00:26:55.496,00:27:00.000
"Now, what is that integral?
Well, at each point,",00:27:00.000,00:27:04.372
"you station a little ant and
the ant reports the outward flow",00:27:04.372,00:27:09.953
"rate across that point which is
F dotted with the normal vector.",00:27:09.953,00:27:15.813
"I will put in a few normal
vectors just to remind you.",00:27:15.813,00:27:20.744
"The normal vectors look like
little unit vectors pointing",00:27:20.744,00:27:25.953
"perpendicularly outwards
everywhere.",00:27:25.953,00:27:29.209
"These are the n's.
F dotted with the unit normal",00:27:29.209,00:27:34.594
"vector, and that is added up
around the curve.",00:27:34.594,00:27:38.619
"This quantity gives me the flux
of the field across C.",00:27:38.619,00:27:43.361
"Now, we are going to calculate
that by Green's theorem.",00:27:43.361,00:27:48.191
"But, before we calculate it by
Green's theorem,",00:27:48.191,00:27:52.306
"we are going to psych it out.
What is it?",00:27:52.306,00:27:55.884
"What is the value of that
integral?",00:27:55.884,00:28:00.000
"Well, since I am asking you to
do it in your head there can",00:28:00.000,00:28:04.131
"only be one possible answer.
It is zero.",00:28:04.131,00:28:06.910
"Why is that integral zero?
Well, because at each point the",00:28:06.910,00:28:10.970
"field vector,
the velocity vector is",00:28:10.970,00:28:13.464
"perpendicular to the normal
vector.",00:28:13.464,00:28:15.886
"Why?
The normal vector points",00:28:15.886,00:28:17.881
"perpendicularly to the curve but
the field vector always is",00:28:17.881,00:28:22.013
"tangent to the curve because
this curve is a trajectory.",00:28:22.013,00:28:27.000
"It is always supposed to be
going in the direction given by",00:28:27.000,00:28:34.631
"that white field vector.
Do you follow?",00:28:34.631,00:28:39.631
"A trajectory means that it is
always tangent to the field",00:28:39.631,00:28:47.000
"vector and, therefore,
always perpendicular to the",00:28:47.000,00:28:53.447
"normal vector.
This is zero since F dot n is",00:28:53.447,00:28:59.105
"always zero.
Everywhere on the curve,",00:28:59.105,00:29:03.846
"F dot n has to be zero.
There is no flux of this field",00:29:03.846,00:29:07.923
"across the curve because the
field is always in the same",00:29:07.923,00:29:12.153
"direction as the curve,
never perpendicular to it.",00:29:12.153,00:29:15.923
"It has no components
perpendicular to it.",00:29:15.923,00:29:19.000
"Good.
Now let's do it the hard way.",00:29:19.000,00:29:21.615
"Let's use Green's theorem.
Green's theorem says that the",00:29:21.615,00:29:25.846
"flux across C should be equal to
the double integral over that",00:29:25.846,00:29:30.538
"region of the divergence of F.
It's like Gauss theorem in two",00:29:30.538,00:29:35.950
"dimensions, this version of it.
Divergence of F,",00:29:35.950,00:29:39.006
"that is a function,
I double integrate it over the",00:29:39.006,00:29:42.191
"region, and then that is dx /
dy, or let's say da because you",00:29:42.191,00:29:46.092
"might want to do it in polar
coordinates.",00:29:46.092,00:29:48.693
"And, on the problem set,
you certainly will want to do",00:29:48.693,00:29:52.139
"it in polar coordinates,
I think.",00:29:52.139,00:29:55.000
"All right.
How much is that?",00:30:00.000,00:30:02.769
"Well, we haven't yet used the
hypothesis.",00:30:02.769,00:30:06.871
"All we have done is set up the
problem.",00:30:06.871,00:30:10.769
"Now, the hypothesis was that
the divergence is never zero",00:30:10.769,00:30:16.512
"anywhere in D.
Therefore, the divergence is",00:30:16.512,00:30:20.820
"never zero anywhere in R.
What I say is the divergence is",00:30:20.820,00:30:26.564
"either greater than zero
everywhere in R.",00:30:26.564,00:30:32.000
"Or less than zero everywhere in
R.",00:30:32.000,00:30:35.017
"But it cannot be sometimes
positive and sometimes negative.",00:30:35.017,00:30:40.321
"Why not?
In other words,",00:30:40.321,00:30:42.424
"I say it is not possible the
divergence here is one and here",00:30:42.424,00:30:47.820
"is minus two.
That is not possible because,",00:30:47.820,00:30:51.660
"if I drew a line from this
point to that,",00:30:51.660,00:30:55.318
"along that line the divergence
would start positive and end up",00:30:55.318,00:31:00.896
"negative.
And, therefore,",00:31:00.896,00:31:04.021
"have to be zero some time in
between.",00:31:04.021,00:31:06.473
"It's because it is a continuous
function.",00:31:06.473,00:31:09.198
"It is a continuous function.
I am assuming that.",00:31:09.198,00:31:12.399
"And, therefore,
if it sometimes positive and",00:31:12.399,00:31:15.328
"sometimes negative it has to be
zero in between.",00:31:15.328,00:31:18.529
"You cannot get continuously
from plus one to minus two",00:31:18.529,00:31:22.139
"without passing through zero.
The reason for this is,",00:31:22.139,00:31:27.915
"since the divergence is never
zero in R it therefore must",00:31:27.915,00:31:35.014
"always stay positive or always
stay negative.",00:31:35.014,00:31:40.591
"Now, if it always stays
positive, the conclusion is then",00:31:40.591,00:31:47.563
"this double integral must be
positive.",00:31:47.563,00:31:52.253
"Therefore, this double integral
is either greater than zero.",00:31:52.253,00:32:01.000
"That is if the divergence is
always positive.",00:32:01.000,00:32:04.911
"Or, it is less than zero if the
divergence is always negative.",00:32:04.911,00:32:10.333
"But the one thing it cannot be
is not zero.",00:32:10.333,00:32:14.066
"Well, the left-hand side,
Green's theorem is supposed to",00:32:14.066,00:32:18.955
"be true.
Green's theorem is our bedrock.",00:32:18.955,00:32:22.422
"18.02 would crumble without
that so it must be true.",00:32:22.422,00:32:26.955
"One way of calculating the
left-hand side gives us zero.",00:32:26.955,00:32:33.000
"If we calculate the right-hand
side it is not zero.",00:32:33.000,00:32:36.352
"That is called the
contradiction.",00:32:36.352,00:32:38.498
"Where did the contradiction
arise from?",00:32:38.498,00:32:41.046
"It arose from the fact that I
supposed that there was a closed",00:32:41.046,00:32:45.137
"trajectory in that region.
The conclusion is there cannot",00:32:45.137,00:32:48.892
"be any closed trajectory of that
region because it leads to a",00:32:48.892,00:32:52.915
"contradiction via Green's
theorem.",00:32:52.915,00:32:56.000
"Let me see if I can give you
some of the argument for the",00:33:02.000,00:33:06.210
"other, well, let's at least
state the other criterion I",00:33:06.210,00:33:10.270
wanted to give you.,00:33:10.270,00:33:12.000
"Suppose, for example,
we use this system,",00:33:21.000,00:33:25.067

Does this have limit cycles?,00:33:50.000,00:33:53.000
Does that have limit cycles?,00:33:59.000,00:34:02.000
"Let's Bendixson it.
We will calculate the",00:34:08.000,00:34:12.329
"divergence of a vector field.
It is 2x from the top function.",00:34:12.329,00:34:18.824
"The partial with respect to x
is 2x.",00:34:18.824,00:34:22.613
"The second function with
respect to y is negative 2y.",00:34:22.613,00:34:29.000
"That certainly could be zero.
In fact, this is zero along the",00:34:29.000,00:34:34.736
"entire line x equals y.
Its divergence is zero here",00:34:34.736,00:34:39.516
"along that whole line.
The best I could conclude was,",00:34:39.516,00:34:44.488
"I could conclude that there is
no limit cycle like this and",00:34:44.488,00:34:50.033
"there is no limit cycle like
this, but there is nothing so",00:34:50.033,00:34:55.483
"far that says a limit cycle
could not cross that because",00:34:55.483,00:35:00.741
"that would not violate
Bendixson's theorem.",00:35:00.741,00:35:06.000
"In other words,
any domain that contained part",00:35:06.000,00:35:09.686
"of this line,
the divergence would be zero",00:35:09.686,00:35:13.044
"along that line.
And, therefore,",00:35:13.044,00:35:15.583
"I could conclude nothing.
I could have limit cycles that",00:35:15.583,00:35:20.088
"cross that line,
as long as they included a",00:35:20.088,00:35:23.529
"piece of that line in them.
The answer is I cannot make a",00:35:23.529,00:35:28.116
"conclusion.
Well, that is because I am",00:35:28.116,00:35:32.059
"using the wrong criterion.
Let's instead use the critical",00:35:32.059,00:35:36.495

makes a nice positive statement",00:35:55.000,00:35:58.956

way.",00:35:58.956,00:36:01.032

let's first state it",00:36:01.032,00:36:03.108
"positively, even though that is
not the way to use it.",00:36:03.108,00:36:07.000
"The positive statement will be,
once again, we have our region",00:36:07.000,00:36:13.808
"D and we have a region of the xy
plane and we have our C,",00:36:13.808,00:36:20.058

A closed trajectory of what?",00:36:20.058,00:36:26.084
"Of our system.
And that is supposed to be in",00:36:26.084,00:36:30.883
"D.
The critical point criterion",00:36:30.883,00:36:35.333
"says something very simple.
If you have that situation it",00:36:35.333,00:36:42.000
"says that inside that closed
trajectory there must be a",00:36:42.000,00:36:48.428
critical point somewhere.,00:36:48.428,00:36:52.000
"It says that inside C is a
critical point.",00:37:00.000,00:37:08.000
"Now, this won't help us with
the existence problem.",00:37:15.000,00:37:18.652
"This won't help us find a
closed trajectory.",00:37:18.652,00:37:21.794
"We will take our system and say
it has a critical point here and",00:37:21.794,00:37:26.397
"a critical point there.
Does it have a closed",00:37:26.397,00:37:29.611
"trajectory?
Well, all I know is the closed",00:37:29.611,00:37:33.091
"trajectory, if it exists,
will have to go around one or",00:37:33.091,00:37:36.855
"more of those critical points.
But I don't know where.",00:37:36.855,00:37:40.550
"It is not going to go around it
like this.",00:37:40.550,00:37:43.408
"It might go around it like
this.",00:37:43.408,00:37:45.569
"And my computer search won't
find it because it is looking at",00:37:45.569,00:37:49.752
"too small a part of the screen.
It doesn't work that way.",00:37:49.752,00:37:53.656

contraposition.",00:37:53.656,00:37:56.235

contrapositive is?",00:37:56.235,00:38:00.000

A implies B says the same thing",00:38:00.000,00:38:07.764

What would be the",00:38:27.282,00:38:29.027
"contrapositive here?
If you have a closed trajectory",00:38:29.027,00:38:35.939
"inside is a critical point.
The theorem is used this way.",00:38:35.939,00:38:44.862
"If D has no critical points,
it has no closed trajectories",00:38:44.862,00:38:53.945
"and therefore has no limit
cycle.",00:38:53.945,00:39:00.000

closed trajectory,",00:39:00.000,00:39:03.909

point.",00:39:03.909,00:39:07.090

point.",00:39:07.090,00:39:10.181

this system that Bendixson could",00:39:10.181,00:39:15.727
"not handle at all.
We can dispose of this system",00:39:15.727,00:39:20.000
"immediately.
Namely, what is it?",00:39:20.000,00:39:22.818
"Where are its critical points?
Well, where is that zero?",00:39:22.818,00:39:29.000
"x squared plus y 
squared is one,",00:39:29.000,00:39:32.550
"plus one is never zero.
This is positive.",00:39:32.550,00:39:35.449
"Or, worse, zero.
And then I add the one to it",00:39:35.449,00:39:38.637
"and it is not zero anymore.
This has no zeros and,",00:39:38.637,00:39:42.188
"therefore, it does not matter
that this one has a lot of",00:39:42.188,00:39:46.173
"zeros.
It makes no difference.",00:39:46.173,00:39:48.275
"It has no critical points.
It has none,",00:39:48.275,00:39:51.028

give you the proof of this.",00:40:01.000,00:40:04.705

time remaining.",00:40:04.705,00:40:07.804

telling you a story.",00:40:15.351,00:40:18.382

y prime.",00:40:37.000,00:40:39.880

if you change variables you can",00:40:49.406,00:40:52.655

system behavior.",00:41:21.832,00:41:25.778

it was first proposed is how",00:41:42.016,00:41:47.228

other on what the right",00:42:12.155,00:42:16.433
"conjecture is.
But let me tell you a little",00:42:16.433,00:42:20.026
"bit of its history.
There were attempts to solve it",00:42:20.026,00:42:24.304
"in the 20 or 30 years after it
was first proposed,",00:42:24.304,00:42:28.497
"through the 1920 and `30s which
all seemed to have gaps in them.",00:42:28.497,00:42:35.000
"Until finally around 1950 two
Russians mathematicians,",00:42:35.000,00:42:39.818
"one of whom is extremely
well-known, Petrovski,",00:42:39.818,00:42:44.000
"a specialist in systems of
ordinary differential equations",00:42:44.000,00:42:49.181
"published a long and difficult,
complicated 100 page paper in",00:42:49.181,00:42:54.636

maximum number is three.",00:42:54.636,00:43:00.000
"I won't put down their names.
Petrovski-Landis.",00:43:00.000,00:43:03.575
"The maximum number was three.
And then not many people were",00:43:03.575,00:43:08.084
"able to read the paper,
and those who did there seemed",00:43:08.084,00:43:12.203
"to be gaps in the reasoning in
various places until finally",00:43:12.203,00:43:16.712
"Arnold who was the greatest
Russian, in my opinion,",00:43:16.712,00:43:20.598

mathematician,",00:43:20.598,00:43:23.785
"certainly in this field of
analysis and differential",00:43:23.785,00:43:27.750
"equations, but in other fields,
too, he still is great,",00:43:27.750,00:43:31.947

now, criticized it.",00:43:31.947,00:43:37.000

there is a really big gap in",00:43:37.000,00:43:41.164

cannot be considered to be",00:43:41.164,00:43:46.546

People tried working very hard",00:43:46.546,00:43:50.304

success.",00:43:50.304,00:43:53.757
