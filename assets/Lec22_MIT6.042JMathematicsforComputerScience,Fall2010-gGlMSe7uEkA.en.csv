"PROFESSOR: OK,
let's get started.",00:00:24.780,00:00:26.497
"Last week we talked
about random variables.",00:00:29.400,00:00:32.520
"And this week
we're going to talk",00:00:32.520,00:00:34.540
about their expected value.,00:00:34.540,00:00:37.550
"The expected value
of a random variable",00:00:37.550,00:00:41.000
"comes up in all sorts
of applications.",00:00:41.000,00:00:42.637
"We're going to spend a
whole week talking about it",00:00:42.637,00:00:44.720
"and some of next week
talking about variations",00:00:44.720,00:00:46.980
from the expected value.,00:00:46.980,00:00:48.496
"And it's probably
one of the best",00:00:48.496,00:00:49.870
"tools you have for
working with probability",00:00:49.870,00:00:52.190
problems in practice.,00:00:52.190,00:00:54.289
"So let's write down
the definition.",00:00:54.289,00:00:55.747
"The expected value
also has other names.",00:01:04.129,00:01:12.320
"It's also known as the
average or the mean",00:01:12.320,00:01:23.570
of a random variable.,00:01:23.570,00:01:24.683
"Random variable R over
a probability space S",00:01:29.390,00:01:41.950
is denoted by a lot of ways.,00:01:41.950,00:01:44.520
"We're going to use Ex
to denote it, Ex of R.",00:01:44.520,00:01:48.760
"And it's the sum over all
possible outcomes in the sample",00:01:48.760,00:01:52.070
"space of the value of
the random variable",00:01:52.070,00:01:55.670
"on that outcome times the
probability of that outcome.",00:01:55.670,00:02:01.190
"In other words, the expected
value of a random variable",00:02:01.190,00:02:04.310
"is just a weighted average
of all possible values",00:02:04.310,00:02:09.080
"of the random variable where
the weight is the probability",00:02:09.080,00:02:13.380
of that happening.,00:02:13.380,00:02:15.910
"For example, suppose we
roll a fair six sided die.",00:02:15.910,00:02:27.438
"So the numbers that
come up are 1 to 6.",00:02:30.860,00:02:33.810
"And we let R be the
random variable denoting",00:02:33.810,00:02:37.890
"the outcome, 1 through 6.",00:02:37.890,00:02:40.135
"So the expected
value of the role,",00:02:43.330,00:02:45.990
"we can easily compute
from the definition.",00:02:45.990,00:02:50.160
"Well, there's a 1/6 chance
that it comes out a 1.",00:02:50.160,00:02:54.890
The next outcome would be a 2.,00:02:54.890,00:02:56.200
That happens with 1/6 chance.,00:02:56.200,00:02:59.600
"3, 4, 5, and six all
happen with a 1/6 chance.",00:02:59.600,00:03:03.025
"If I sum up 1, 2, 3, 4 up to
6, I get 6 times 7 over 2 times",00:03:06.680,00:03:13.000
"the 1/6 is just 7
over 2 or 3 and 1/2.",00:03:13.000,00:03:16.910
"So expected value when I roll
a die, a fair six sided die,",00:03:19.590,00:03:23.320
is just 3 and 1/2.,00:03:23.320,00:03:25.320
"And as you can see
from this example,",00:03:25.320,00:03:27.880
"the expected value doesn't
have to be attainable by one",00:03:27.880,00:03:31.210
of the outcomes.,00:03:31.210,00:03:33.030
"You don't get a 3 and
1/2 when you roll a die.",00:03:33.030,00:03:36.730
But that's the average value.,00:03:36.730,00:03:39.840
"Now the expected value, the
expectation, the average,",00:03:39.840,00:03:44.080
"the mean, they're
all the same thing.",00:03:44.080,00:03:46.812
"They're all defined based
on a random variable.",00:03:46.812,00:03:48.770
They all mean the same thing.,00:03:48.770,00:03:50.890
"They are all different
than the median.",00:03:50.890,00:03:54.384
"That's something
that's different.",00:03:54.384,00:03:55.800
So let me define the median.,00:03:55.800,00:03:58.400
"Basically it is the
outcome which splits",00:03:58.400,00:04:02.090
the probabilities in half.,00:04:02.090,00:04:03.390
"In other words, you've
got a 50% chance",00:04:03.390,00:04:05.030
"of being bigger than the median
and a 50% chance of being",00:04:05.030,00:04:08.260
smaller.,00:04:08.260,00:04:09.760
"Now precisely you can
define it this way.",00:04:09.760,00:04:17.209
"The median of a
random variable R",00:04:17.209,00:04:24.950
"is the value in the range of
R such that the probability",00:04:24.950,00:04:35.300
"that the random variable is
less than this median point is",00:04:35.300,00:04:39.700
at most 1/2.,00:04:39.700,00:04:42.020
"And the probability
that random variable",00:04:42.020,00:04:44.330
"is bigger than the median
is strictly less than 1/2.",00:04:44.330,00:04:48.086
"Now, some texts
do it differently.",00:04:50.910,00:04:52.950
"They swap this less than
or equal to with this one.",00:04:52.950,00:04:56.944
"And it could give you
a different answer",00:04:56.944,00:04:58.610
if you do that.,00:04:58.610,00:05:01.170
"And I think in the text,
actually, we screwed it up.",00:05:01.170,00:05:04.506
"So we have to get
that corrected.",00:05:04.506,00:05:05.880
"I think we might have
put a less than or equal",00:05:05.880,00:05:07.796
"here, which is not
the right definition.",00:05:07.796,00:05:09.990
"So this is the right
definition that we'll use.",00:05:09.990,00:05:13.160
"So using this definition,
what is the median",00:05:13.160,00:05:16.730
"of the random variable that
corresponds to rolling a die?",00:05:16.730,00:05:20.950
"What's the median when I
roll a six sided fair die?",00:05:20.950,00:05:24.551
"Not 3 and 1/2, because it's
got to be one of the values.",00:05:27.810,00:05:32.820
"The median does have
to be in the realm",00:05:32.820,00:05:35.652
of the random variable.,00:05:35.652,00:05:36.610
"It has to one of the
attainable values.",00:05:36.610,00:05:39.340
"What's the median value
when I roll a die?",00:05:39.340,00:05:41.900
AUDIENCE: Four.,00:05:41.900,00:05:43.280
PROFESSOR: Four.,00:05:43.280,00:05:43.980
Let's try that out.,00:05:43.980,00:05:45.580
"If I plug in 4 here, the
probability I'm less than 4",00:05:45.580,00:05:49.620
is 1/2.,00:05:49.620,00:05:50.790
"Could be 1, 2, or 3.",00:05:50.790,00:05:52.540
"The probability of greater
than 4 is 5 or six is 1/3.",00:05:52.540,00:05:57.330
That's less than 1/2.,00:05:57.330,00:05:58.470
So 4 works.,00:05:58.470,00:06:00.280
"3 doesn't work, because the
probability I'm bigger than 3",00:06:00.280,00:06:05.290
is 1/2.,00:06:05.290,00:06:06.710
So it doesn't work.,00:06:06.710,00:06:08.296
"And the other definition
sometimes people use",00:06:08.296,00:06:10.170
"would turn out that
three is the median.",00:06:10.170,00:06:11.960
"Now, we're not going
to spend any more",00:06:14.560,00:06:16.160
time talking about the median.,00:06:16.160,00:06:18.330
"What's really important in
probability is the mean.",00:06:18.330,00:06:21.430
"And that's because
you can do a whole lot",00:06:21.430,00:06:23.170
more with it in applications.,00:06:23.170,00:06:25.970
"Any question about the
definitions so far?",00:06:25.970,00:06:31.770
"All right, so now we're going to
do a more interesting example.",00:06:31.770,00:06:36.890
"We're going to play
a gambling game",00:06:36.890,00:06:39.780
"and we're going to analyze the
expected winnings, the expected",00:06:39.780,00:06:43.110
return.,00:06:43.110,00:06:44.810
"And this is a simple
three person game",00:06:44.810,00:06:47.090
"that you can see played
in bars and informally.",00:06:47.090,00:06:52.480
"But to play it I
need a volunteer",00:06:52.480,00:06:55.590
"from the class, somebody
who wants to play.",00:06:55.590,00:06:57.625
You've done it.,00:06:57.625,00:06:58.250
Who hasn't done it?,00:06:58.250,00:06:59.041
Have you done it?,00:06:59.041,00:07:00.359
You haven't played.,00:07:00.359,00:07:01.150
"Do you have money
in your pocket?",00:07:01.150,00:07:03.012
You got to borrow some money.,00:07:03.012,00:07:04.220
"If you don't have any money,
you got to borrow some.",00:07:04.220,00:07:07.048
AUDIENCE: How much money?,00:07:07.048,00:07:08.770
"PROFESSOR: Oh, I
don't know, $5 or $10.",00:07:08.770,00:07:11.560
Got it?,00:07:11.560,00:07:12.120
"All right, come on down.",00:07:12.120,00:07:13.507
"you're going to play
against a couple of TAs.",00:07:15.746,00:07:17.620
"Maybe a couple of you
will want to play.",00:07:17.620,00:07:20.910
"I'll get Nick and
Martyna to play here.",00:07:20.910,00:07:23.630
"Now, this is a very simple game.",00:07:23.630,00:07:27.960
"In each round, each of the
players is going to wager $2.",00:07:27.960,00:07:33.060
"So I can loan you guys
some money here, I guess.",00:07:33.060,00:07:36.950
So you have $2?,00:07:36.950,00:07:39.741
"All right, I have
to loan you money.",00:07:39.741,00:07:41.240
I better count this out.,00:07:41.240,00:07:42.646
"AUDIENCE: I think I
can find the Zimbabwe",00:07:42.646,00:07:44.354
dollars I had here somewhere.,00:07:44.354,00:07:45.900
"PROFESSOR: I don't know
if I'm taking those.",00:07:45.900,00:07:47.260
"Here, you can split that up.",00:07:47.260,00:07:48.426
I loaned you guys $10 there.,00:07:48.426,00:07:49.850
You got $2.,00:07:49.850,00:07:50.880
Put it on the table.,00:07:50.880,00:07:53.780
Wager your $2.,00:07:53.780,00:07:55.760
"Now what we're going
to do is they're each",00:07:55.760,00:07:58.160
"going to guess the
results of a coin toss.",00:07:58.160,00:08:02.230
"We'll put the pot
together here, mix it up.",00:08:02.230,00:08:05.371
You only have to do two.,00:08:05.371,00:08:06.370
You can save those for now.,00:08:06.370,00:08:08.250
"Oh, that's your two.",00:08:08.250,00:08:09.420
"All right, so we
have $6 in the pot.",00:08:09.420,00:08:12.220
"Now, each of you is going to
guess the outcome of a coin.",00:08:12.220,00:08:15.670
So here's the guesses.,00:08:15.670,00:08:17.330
"Heads or tails, that's for you.",00:08:17.330,00:08:19.930
"Heads or tails,
the guess for you.",00:08:19.930,00:08:21.399
And you get a heads or a tails.,00:08:21.399,00:08:22.690
"So instead of writing
it down, you're",00:08:22.690,00:08:24.270
"going to sort of
hide those, maybe",00:08:24.270,00:08:26.070
"get some advice from
the class, and you're",00:08:26.070,00:08:27.820
"going to pick one and put it on
the table here as your guess.",00:08:27.820,00:08:32.409
"And then one of you out
there is going to flip a coin",00:08:32.409,00:08:35.650
"and announce the
result. And then we're",00:08:35.650,00:08:38.909
"going to reveal their
guesses and the winners",00:08:38.909,00:08:42.480
split the money.,00:08:42.480,00:08:44.670
"And if there's no winners,
well, they take their $2 back",00:08:44.670,00:08:47.940
and they split the pot.,00:08:47.940,00:08:49.570
So this is a very fair game.,00:08:49.570,00:08:52.520
"They make their
choices, you guys",00:08:52.520,00:08:54.810
"toss the coin, and the
winners share of the pot.",00:08:54.810,00:08:57.350
"If there's one, winner they get
$6, which is a profit of $4.",00:08:57.350,00:09:01.650
"Two winners, they each
get three, profit of one,",00:09:01.650,00:09:04.480
the other one's out two bucks.,00:09:04.480,00:09:06.790
"Nobody wins, they get
their money back, profit 0.",00:09:06.790,00:09:08.940
"They all win, they get
their money back, profit 0.",00:09:08.940,00:09:11.300
Is the game clear?,00:09:11.300,00:09:13.520
Who's got a coin out there?,00:09:13.520,00:09:15.810
You've got a coin?,00:09:15.810,00:09:17.030
Very good.,00:09:17.030,00:09:17.870
"Now you've got to
guess the coin.",00:09:17.870,00:09:19.510
"Don't show each
other your guesses.",00:09:19.510,00:09:22.520
"And put your guesses
on the table here.",00:09:22.520,00:09:26.459
You get to pick heads or tails.,00:09:26.459,00:09:27.750
Put it on the table.,00:09:27.750,00:09:28.583
[LAUGHS],00:09:35.270,00:09:36.620
This is not a hard game.,00:09:36.620,00:09:37.950
"You got a heads
and a tails, right?",00:09:41.140,00:09:44.710
"Well, yeah, did you put a
heads or a tails in there?",00:09:44.710,00:09:48.198
"Yeah, there's one
heads, one tails.",00:09:48.198,00:09:51.650
"No, that's blank.",00:09:51.650,00:09:52.420
You don't win that way.,00:09:52.420,00:09:53.909
There you go.,00:09:53.909,00:09:54.450
That's the tails.,00:09:54.450,00:09:55.158
AUDIENCE: I thought you meant--,00:09:55.158,00:09:56.940
PROFESSOR: Heads.,00:09:56.940,00:09:57.690
"So if you want heads,
you go like that.",00:09:57.690,00:09:59.418
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:09:59.418,00:09:59.846
"I thought you meant
do it the other way.",00:09:59.846,00:10:01.560
PROFESSOR: There you go.,00:10:01.560,00:10:02.345
"AUDIENCE: All right, I'll have
to make these indistinguishable",00:10:02.345,00:10:04.205
now.,00:10:04.205,00:10:05.140
"PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.",00:10:05.140,00:10:06.140
"One of them is
all ripped up now.",00:10:06.140,00:10:09.030
"They already guessed, so they've
already done their guess.",00:10:09.030,00:10:11.490
"So you pick one
and put it there.",00:10:11.490,00:10:12.800
"AUDIENCE: This is
what I was originally",00:10:12.800,00:10:14.425
going to guess anyway.,00:10:14.425,00:10:15.997
PROFESSOR: So that's good.,00:10:15.997,00:10:17.080
"And you now flip the coin
and tell us what it came out.",00:10:17.080,00:10:24.690
AUDIENCE: Heads.,00:10:24.690,00:10:25.562
PROFESSOR: Heads.,00:10:25.562,00:10:26.270
"All right, let's
reveal your choices.",00:10:26.270,00:10:27.811
"All right, so there's one heads.",00:10:30.280,00:10:31.930
Martyna takes all the money.,00:10:31.930,00:10:35.780
"Just bad luck there, right?",00:10:35.780,00:10:37.377
We're going to play again.,00:10:37.377,00:10:38.460
We're going to play a few times.,00:10:38.460,00:10:39.793
"But let's start recording
what happened here.",00:10:39.793,00:10:43.490
So the coin came out heads.,00:10:43.490,00:10:46.850
"OK, remind me your name?",00:10:46.850,00:10:48.005
AUDIENCE: Adam.,00:10:48.005,00:10:48.630
PROFESSOR: Adam gassed tails.,00:10:48.630,00:10:50.950
And Martyna.,00:10:54.850,00:10:56.061
Is it Y?,00:10:59.230,00:11:01.290
"Martyna guessed heads and
Nick, he also loses at tails.",00:11:01.290,00:11:07.680
So in this case Adam is out $2.,00:11:07.680,00:11:13.780
Martyna got a profit of $4.,00:11:13.780,00:11:16.800
And Nick is also down $2.,00:11:16.800,00:11:20.230
"All right, let's try it again.",00:11:20.230,00:11:22.800
"So again, pick another
heads or tails.",00:11:22.800,00:11:26.500
"Adam's busily working
out probabilities here.",00:11:26.500,00:11:30.802
"Well you got to put your
money on the table here now.",00:11:30.802,00:11:33.010
You got $2.,00:11:33.010,00:11:35.700
That's three.,00:11:35.700,00:11:37.480
Here you go.,00:11:37.480,00:11:38.517

You can make change if you want.,00:11:41.330,00:11:43.390
There we go.,00:11:43.390,00:11:44.650
"All right, make your choices.",00:11:44.650,00:11:47.990
You got one?,00:11:47.990,00:11:50.800
"As long as you guys don't
show him your choices,",00:11:50.800,00:11:53.050
"we should be good here, I think.",00:11:53.050,00:11:55.340
And you got to pick one here.,00:11:55.340,00:11:56.790
Very good.,00:12:00.140,00:12:00.640

"All right, good job.",00:12:07.560,00:12:08.480
"OK, Adam got heads and
Martyna's on a roll here.",00:12:08.480,00:12:11.506
So we got to split this up.,00:12:11.506,00:12:12.630
"Can you make change
for him here?",00:12:12.630,00:12:14.360
He gets $3.,00:12:14.360,00:12:16.080
So it was heads.,00:12:16.080,00:12:18.750
"Adam had heads, Martyna has
heads, and Nick's in trouble.",00:12:18.750,00:12:23.870
"Nick's off another
$2 of my money.",00:12:23.870,00:12:28.180
"Martyna is up $1 because she
wagered two and got three",00:12:28.180,00:12:32.690
"and Adam is up $1
here for that one.",00:12:32.690,00:12:37.570
"All right, let's make
another selection.",00:12:37.570,00:12:39.420
Heads or tails?,00:12:39.420,00:12:41.700
"Put the money up here, $2.",00:12:41.700,00:12:43.860

expectations in a minute,",00:13:09.275,00:13:11.400
do the tree method.,00:13:11.400,00:13:12.191
Is there any catch going on?,00:13:12.191,00:13:15.080

"Oh Adam, tough break.",00:17:00.930,00:17:02.110
Nick again.,00:17:02.110,00:17:03.580
Nick is the sole winner.,00:17:03.580,00:17:04.859
So he collects on the heads.,00:17:04.859,00:17:06.880
"All right, so it's plus $4
for Nick, minus 2 for Martina,",00:17:11.440,00:17:17.119
minus 2 for Adam.,00:17:17.119,00:17:19.880
"All right, let's see
how they did in total.",00:17:19.880,00:17:22.980
"Oh, poor Adam.",00:17:22.980,00:17:24.020
Minus $6 here.,00:17:24.020,00:17:26.940
How did that happen?,00:17:26.940,00:17:27.800
Martyna is plus $6.,00:17:27.800,00:17:32.560
Now we know how it happened.,00:17:32.560,00:17:34.570
And Nick is even.,00:17:34.570,00:17:37.655
Even.,00:17:40.266,00:17:40.766
"Yeah, so that's just a
tough break for Adam.",00:17:46.950,00:17:50.050

you probably should.",00:17:57.779,00:17:59.320
"But I need to get paid
back from Nick here.",00:17:59.320,00:18:02.500
"Now obviously this is
a fair game, right?",00:18:02.500,00:18:06.420
"So how many people think
that Adam was just unlucky?",00:18:06.420,00:18:08.760
A few.,00:18:12.010,00:18:13.010
"How many people think we

"Yeah, you're right.",00:18:17.450,00:18:19.000
"But let's do the analysis
to see what happened here.",00:18:19.000,00:18:23.260
"Meanwhile, I probably
should give him his $6.",00:18:23.260,00:18:26.156

Thanks very much.,00:19:07.840,00:19:10.247
Just leave the money here.,00:19:10.247,00:19:11.330
Yeah.,00:19:11.330,00:19:12.377

give them back their $6.",00:19:21.672,00:19:24.570
"Well, otherwise they
could report me,",00:19:24.570,00:19:26.304
and I'd be in trouble.,00:19:26.304,00:19:27.220
And it's all on film.,00:19:27.220,00:19:28.450
That would not be good.,00:19:28.450,00:19:31.120
"OK, so what we're going to
do now is analyze the game.",00:19:31.120,00:19:35.990
"And I'm going to
prove to you he was",00:19:35.990,00:19:38.320
"just unlucky, despite
the fact that you",00:19:38.320,00:19:40.520
think I screwed him here.,00:19:40.520,00:19:42.830

Adam's expected winnings",00:19:42.830,00:19:46.730
playing this game.,00:19:46.730,00:19:48.910
So let's do that.,00:19:48.910,00:19:49.840
"So we're going to make
the tree, as usual.",00:19:52.600,00:19:55.880
"Now, the first thing we
have is Adam's choice.",00:19:55.880,00:20:00.500
"Now, Adam were you doing
anything besides sort",00:20:00.500,00:20:02.467
of randomly picking?,00:20:02.467,00:20:03.300
"Were you trying to
psych out the coin?",00:20:03.300,00:20:04.883
"AUDIENCE: Apparently I
wouldn't be able to bribe him",00:20:07.784,00:20:09.950
from all the way down here.,00:20:09.950,00:20:11.370
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
you did lose most of it.",00:20:11.370,00:20:13.280
"We'll say Adam
was playing 50-50.",00:20:13.280,00:20:16.870
It's a reasonable assumption.,00:20:16.870,00:20:18.850
"And then we have
Martyna and then",00:20:18.850,00:20:22.550
we have Nick and their choices.,00:20:22.550,00:20:26.010
"And let's say they're 50-50
as well, because none of them",00:20:26.010,00:20:29.530
"know what coin is
going to be tossed.",00:20:29.530,00:20:31.280
"And I'm not going to draw
this bottom half of the tree,",00:20:31.280,00:20:33.571
but it's totally symmetric.,00:20:33.571,00:20:35.000
It just gets too deep otherwise.,00:20:35.000,00:20:38.060
"And then we have Nick's choices,
heads, tails, heads, tails.",00:20:38.060,00:20:45.230
And they're 50-50.,00:20:45.230,00:20:46.027
And then we have the coin.,00:20:50.342,00:20:51.425
"And I'll start
drawing it down here.",00:20:53.941,00:20:55.440
"And the coin can
be heads or tails.",00:20:55.440,00:20:57.197
"And we're going to
assume it was a fair coin",00:20:57.197,00:20:59.030
"toss back there, because
it looked like it",00:20:59.030,00:21:00.780
was flipping a bunch of times.,00:21:00.780,00:21:02.320
"And you don't look
like Persi Diaconis,",00:21:02.320,00:21:04.640
"so we're going to
assume you didn't",00:21:04.640,00:21:06.240
learn how to flip heads always.,00:21:06.240,00:21:09.150
So those are 50-50.,00:21:09.150,00:21:10.118
A little tight here.,00:21:13.790,00:21:16.330
Everything is 50-50.,00:21:16.330,00:21:17.370
"So the probabilities
are all 1/16.",00:21:23.040,00:21:27.680
I got 16 possible outcomes.,00:21:27.680,00:21:30.670
2 by 2 by 2 by 2.,00:21:30.670,00:21:32.330
They're all equally likely.,00:21:32.330,00:21:34.044
"So all the
probabilities are 1/16.",00:21:34.044,00:21:35.460
And now let's see the winnings.,00:21:41.970,00:21:45.380
So we'll take Adam's game.,00:21:45.380,00:21:48.957
It'll turn out to be negative.,00:21:48.957,00:21:50.207
"Now, in this case if Adam's
heads and Martyna and Nick",00:21:53.790,00:21:58.440
"are heads and the coin comes
up heads, they all win,",00:21:58.440,00:22:02.990
they split the pot.,00:22:02.990,00:22:03.880
"So how much is the gain
for Adam in that case?",00:22:03.880,00:22:07.670
0.,00:22:07.670,00:22:10.630
"Now they all guessed heads,
but the coin comes out tails,",00:22:10.630,00:22:14.600
so they split the pot.,00:22:14.600,00:22:15.720
What's Adam's gain there?,00:22:15.720,00:22:19.150
"0, because they just
split the pot again.",00:22:19.150,00:22:21.240
He gets his $2 back.,00:22:21.240,00:22:22.350
That's 0.,00:22:22.350,00:22:25.010
"Now we have a case
where Nick is tails,",00:22:25.010,00:22:29.430
"Adam and Martyna were heads,
and it comes out heads.",00:22:29.430,00:22:33.100
So Nick is losing here.,00:22:33.100,00:22:34.870
"The pot is split by
Adam and Martyna.",00:22:34.870,00:22:37.500
What does Adam get as a profit?,00:22:37.500,00:22:40.540
1.,00:22:40.540,00:22:41.040
"He gets half the part because
he splits with Martyna.",00:22:41.040,00:22:43.290
"That's $3 he put into,
he gets 1, plus 1.",00:22:43.290,00:22:49.080
"Now it turns out same
scenario of guesses,",00:22:49.080,00:22:51.710
"but it comes out tails,
so Nick wins everything.",00:22:51.710,00:22:54.740
What's Adam's status here?,00:22:54.740,00:22:57.550
Minus 2.,00:22:57.550,00:22:58.360
"He bet $2, he lost it.",00:22:58.360,00:23:01.800
"Then we have heads for
Adam, tails for Martyna,",00:23:01.800,00:23:07.000
heads for Nick.,00:23:07.000,00:23:08.330
"Coin comes up heads, Adam splits
with Nick, he gets a net of $1.",00:23:08.330,00:23:15.550
"Same scenario
guesses, but now it's",00:23:15.550,00:23:17.300
"tails, so Martina wins
everything, Adam loses $2.",00:23:17.300,00:23:22.770
"Now we go down to
here where it's",00:23:22.770,00:23:24.180
"heads for Adam, tails
for Martyna and Nick,",00:23:24.180,00:23:28.650
"and heads comes up, so
Adam wins the whole thing.",00:23:28.650,00:23:31.520
What does he get in this case?,00:23:31.520,00:23:34.430
Plus 4.,00:23:34.430,00:23:35.020
"He wins the whole
part of 6 minus 2.",00:23:35.020,00:23:36.640
So he gets 4 net.,00:23:36.640,00:23:38.410
"And then lastly, in this
scenario it comes up tails",00:23:38.410,00:23:42.690
"and Martina and Nick
split the pot, Adam loses.",00:23:42.690,00:23:46.920
Minus 2.,00:23:46.920,00:23:48.810
"And then the same thing
is happening down here.",00:23:48.810,00:23:52.030
Same thing.,00:23:52.030,00:23:52.860
"It's just everything is
reversed by symmetry.",00:23:52.860,00:23:56.800
"Now, they're all equally likely.",00:23:56.800,00:23:59.290
"So what we do to compute
the expected gain",00:23:59.290,00:24:01.380
"is take each value times its
probability and add them up.",00:24:01.380,00:24:05.290
"So 0 times 1/16
plus 0 times 1/16",00:24:05.290,00:24:08.420
"plus 1 times 1/16 minus 2
times 1/16 and so forth.",00:24:08.420,00:24:12.190
"So it's easier just to add
these up and multiply by 1/16.",00:24:12.190,00:24:15.450
"And when we do, we get 0.",00:24:15.450,00:24:18.430
We get 0.,00:24:18.430,00:24:20.070
"If I add all these up, I get 0.",00:24:20.070,00:24:21.510
The same thing for down here.,00:24:21.510,00:24:23.420
"So the expected
gain for Adam is 0.",00:24:23.420,00:24:34.050
And that is a fair game.,00:24:34.050,00:24:35.841
What do you think?,00:24:39.320,00:24:40.746
"Do you think we'd go to
all that trouble just",00:24:40.746,00:24:42.620
to play a fair game?,00:24:42.620,00:24:43.670
"Or do you think we're trying to
set him up and take his money?",00:24:43.670,00:24:46.800
Yeah.,00:24:46.800,00:24:48.666
"AUDIENCE: Martyna and
Nick are alternating,",00:24:48.666,00:24:51.890
"so the branch with
the plus 4 goes away.",00:24:51.890,00:24:53.824
"PROFESSOR: Oh,
that's interesting.",00:24:53.824,00:24:55.240
Look what happened here.,00:24:55.240,00:24:56.396
"Nick and Martina,
well, they're opposite.",00:24:59.588,00:25:09.350
That's opposite.,00:25:09.350,00:25:11.290
That's opposite.,00:25:11.290,00:25:12.090
That's opposite.,00:25:12.090,00:25:14.180
"You don't suppose they
planned that, do you?",00:25:14.180,00:25:16.050
"And how could that possibly
help that they just",00:25:19.610,00:25:22.620
happened to guess opposite?,00:25:22.620,00:25:24.414
"AUDIENCE: One of
them always wins.",00:25:24.414,00:25:25.830
"PROFESSOR: One of
them always wins.",00:25:25.830,00:25:27.920
"And what does that
mean for poor Adam?",00:25:27.920,00:25:29.956
"AUDIENCE: He never
takes the whole pot.",00:25:29.956,00:25:31.580
"PROFESSOR: He never
takes the whole pot.",00:25:31.580,00:25:34.660
"Well, all right.",00:25:34.660,00:25:36.430
"Let's see if that
changed anything here.",00:25:36.430,00:25:40.050
"So if Nick and
Martyna are always",00:25:40.050,00:25:43.950
"opposite, that means some of
these branches can't occur.",00:25:43.950,00:25:48.260
"So if Martyna's heads,
Nick is tails, this is out.",00:25:48.260,00:25:51.760
"So this is happening
with probability 1 now.",00:25:51.760,00:25:55.100
"So these points are at
1/8 each instead of 1/16.",00:25:55.100,00:26:02.210
"And these go to 0 because
that branch can't happen.",00:26:02.210,00:26:06.770
Same thing here.,00:26:06.770,00:26:07.490
"When you go tails to
Martyna, Nick can't be tails,",00:26:07.490,00:26:11.290
has to be heads.,00:26:11.290,00:26:13.110
So these go to 1/8.,00:26:13.110,00:26:16.590
These go to 0.,00:26:16.590,00:26:17.755
"Now, you notice this isn't
working out so well for Adam",00:26:21.180,00:26:24.190
"because we're putting
more weight here",00:26:24.190,00:26:26.830
"where he's got a net negative
compared to an even situation.",00:26:26.830,00:26:31.750
"And here he's gone from a
positive situation, that's",00:26:31.750,00:26:35.200
"getting wiped out
to a net negative.",00:26:35.200,00:26:37.380
"So let's compute
his probability now.",00:26:37.380,00:26:39.960
"And I'll get the same
contribution down here.",00:26:39.960,00:26:42.480
"I've got 1 minus 2 plus 1
of 0 minus 2 is negative 2.",00:26:42.480,00:26:49.760
"I'll get a negative 2
down here times 1/8.",00:26:49.760,00:26:52.760
"In this case, I'll
have the expected gain",00:26:52.760,00:26:55.080
for Adam is going to be minus.,00:26:55.080,00:27:00.330
Let's make sure I do this right.,00:27:00.330,00:27:02.270
"It's going to be 2 for the
top and bottom times 1/8",00:27:02.270,00:27:09.130
times these guys.,00:27:09.130,00:27:12.560
1 minus 2 plus 1 minus 2.,00:27:12.560,00:27:17.110
And that equals minus 2.,00:27:17.110,00:27:20.890
That's minus 1/2.,00:27:20.890,00:27:21.880
"So in fact, if they come up
here and guess differently,",00:27:27.540,00:27:31.600
who knew?,00:27:31.600,00:27:33.330
"Now the expected gain
for Adam is minus $0.50.",00:27:33.330,00:27:36.610
"Every time he plays, he expects
to lose $0.50 on his $2 bet.",00:27:36.610,00:27:42.420
"That's a lousy game for
Adam to be playing, even",00:27:42.420,00:27:46.290
though it seemed very fair.,00:27:46.290,00:27:50.830
You see what's going on here?,00:27:50.830,00:27:52.680
"Now, this kind of trick is used
in all sorts of gambling games.",00:27:52.680,00:27:58.790
"Maybe you've probably
played some of these games",00:27:58.790,00:28:00.790
"and may not have realized
maybe somebody was",00:28:00.790,00:28:02.623
using this trick against you.,00:28:02.623,00:28:05.240
"For example, how
many of you have",00:28:05.240,00:28:06.640
"been in some kind of
sports betting pool?",00:28:06.640,00:28:10.424
"It's March Madness,
you're betting",00:28:10.424,00:28:11.840
on the victors in round one.,00:28:11.840,00:28:15.350
"It's a football pool
for the weekend.",00:28:15.350,00:28:17.180
"You're going to guess
against the spread.",00:28:17.180,00:28:18.550
Who's going to win?,00:28:18.550,00:28:19.341
"All right, some of
you have done that.",00:28:19.341,00:28:21.420
"All right, now everybody
puts $1 into the pool.",00:28:21.420,00:28:24.160
"And the winner is the
guy who was the most wins",00:28:24.160,00:28:27.110
or games picked right.,00:28:27.110,00:28:28.330
All the winners split the pot.,00:28:28.330,00:28:31.240
"Now, what this says, by doing
the same kind of analysis we",00:28:31.240,00:28:34.380
"just did, is that if you
collude with one or two or three",00:28:34.380,00:28:39.430
"other players in the pool
to always pick differently",00:28:39.430,00:28:43.260
"on all the games, it's
going to give you an edge.",00:28:43.260,00:28:47.170
Same reasoning.,00:28:47.170,00:28:48.330
"When they pick differently,
it gives them an edge",00:28:48.330,00:28:51.280
"and now your expected
return is bigger than 0,",00:28:51.280,00:28:54.580
"at the expense of
the other players who",00:28:54.580,00:28:57.080
"just go in and are
putting their picks, if we",00:28:57.080,00:28:59.640
assume each one is 50-50.,00:28:59.640,00:29:02.340
"In fact, a former professor
of statistics here at MIT",00:29:02.340,00:29:06.590
"used this idea, a guy named
Herman Chernoff, in the 1980s",00:29:06.590,00:29:12.030
to beat the state lottery.,00:29:12.030,00:29:15.190
"Now, everyone knows
that lotteries",00:29:15.190,00:29:17.600
"are the worst game around
because everybody puts",00:29:17.600,00:29:20.430
"the money in, the
state takes half,",00:29:20.430,00:29:24.080
"and then the winners
split the pot.",00:29:24.080,00:29:26.850
So it's a horrendous game.,00:29:26.850,00:29:28.540
"Your expected return is
half of what you put in.",00:29:28.540,00:29:31.190
"So you expect to lose half your
bet, because the state's taking",00:29:31.190,00:29:33.850
"half and splitting the remainder
among all the participants.",00:29:33.850,00:29:38.830
"Now, what Chernoff realized is
that people don't bet randomly.",00:29:38.830,00:29:45.170
"They tend to pick the
same sets of numbers.",00:29:45.170,00:29:49.540
It might be a birthday.,00:29:49.540,00:29:50.780
"There's only so many
birthdays out there.",00:29:50.780,00:29:54.500
"Might be number of
home runs Papi's hit,",00:29:54.500,00:29:57.660
"his batting average,
Pabelbon's ERA.",00:29:57.660,00:30:00.530
Who knows?,00:30:00.530,00:30:03.100
"But they pick a
relatively small set",00:30:03.100,00:30:05.880
"of numbers that
tend to collapse on.",00:30:05.880,00:30:08.620
"In fact, if you graph
how people tend to pick.",00:30:08.620,00:30:14.370
"And say you're
playing pick four,",00:30:14.370,00:30:16.010
where you pick four numbers.,00:30:16.010,00:30:18.187
"And now you look at the
frequency with which",00:30:18.187,00:30:20.020
the numbers are picked.,00:30:20.020,00:30:21.690
"Very crudely it looks
something like this.",00:30:21.690,00:30:25.090
"Every once in a while
you get a hot ticket",00:30:25.090,00:30:27.230
"where a lot of people
pick that number.",00:30:27.230,00:30:31.890
"For example, if you're
picking four numbers,",00:30:31.890,00:30:33.940
"MIT students might
pick 2, 4, 6, 16.",00:30:33.940,00:30:39.422
"They might pick that and
so it'd be a big spike",00:30:39.422,00:30:41.380
for that set of four.,00:30:41.380,00:30:43.070
"Down the street they're
probably picking in 1, 2, 3, 4.",00:30:43.070,00:30:47.274
"Something like that and
there's a spike there.",00:30:47.274,00:30:49.190
"If you knew this was
the histogram of what",00:30:52.280,00:30:55.550
"people were picking and
you knew half the pot was",00:30:55.550,00:30:58.640
"going to get split with the
winners, what would you pick?",00:30:58.640,00:31:03.430
Would you pick these?,00:31:03.430,00:31:05.215
"No, because now you're splitting
the pot with 100 people.",00:31:05.215,00:31:07.590
That's no good.,00:31:07.590,00:31:09.190
You pick down here.,00:31:09.190,00:31:11.640
"And now when you win,
you get half the pot.",00:31:11.640,00:31:15.202
"The state always takes
half, but you don't have",00:31:15.202,00:31:17.160
to split it with anybody else.,00:31:17.160,00:31:19.470
"And that means if you're
picking down here,",00:31:19.470,00:31:21.950
"your expected
return is positive,",00:31:21.950,00:31:25.820
even with the state taking half.,00:31:25.820,00:31:27.640
"Because so much of the money
is piled up in these things.",00:31:27.640,00:31:32.330
"And so Chernoff proved
that in fact, he",00:31:32.330,00:31:36.910
"didn't know which
numbers were popular.",00:31:36.910,00:31:39.550
He didn't know that.,00:31:39.550,00:31:40.960
So what did he do?,00:31:40.960,00:31:42.009
"If you don't know where
the spikes are but you're",00:31:42.009,00:31:44.050
"trying to avoid them and
there's not very many spikes,",00:31:44.050,00:31:46.350
what would you do to avoid them?,00:31:46.350,00:31:49.470
Pick random.,00:31:49.470,00:31:51.637
"Because if you pick random,
probably you miss the spike.",00:31:51.637,00:31:53.970
You're down here.,00:31:53.970,00:31:55.680
"With a number nobody would
have thought to pick,",00:31:55.680,00:31:57.680
if some random number.,00:31:57.680,00:31:59.430
"And he showed that, in
fact, if you pick randomly,",00:31:59.430,00:32:02.240
"your expected gain for
the lottery at the time",00:32:02.240,00:32:06.870
"was 7%, or $0.7 on the dollar.",00:32:06.870,00:32:10.500
"So positive even with
the state taking half.",00:32:10.500,00:32:13.500
"Now, shortly after that,
you saw the proliferation",00:32:13.500,00:32:17.160
"of these random machines that
we create random numbers.",00:32:17.160,00:32:20.970
"Because the state wanted
to balance it out and not",00:32:20.970,00:32:23.090
have this kind of a scenario.,00:32:23.090,00:32:25.310
"So now a lot of the
picks are randomly",00:32:25.310,00:32:26.910
"generated in a lot
of the lotteries.",00:32:26.910,00:32:29.570
"These things are not
immediately obvious,",00:32:34.210,00:32:36.280
"but become very clear once you
know the mathematics behind it.",00:32:36.280,00:32:42.240
Any questions?,00:32:42.240,00:32:43.860
Yeah.,00:32:43.860,00:32:44.645
"AUDIENCE: How would a
person hit a random number?",00:32:44.645,00:32:47.900
"PROFESSOR: Oh, you go to
your favorite computer",00:32:47.900,00:32:49.870
"and do a random
number generator.",00:32:49.870,00:32:52.290
"Now, that's not
perfectly random.",00:32:52.290,00:32:54.490
"People do get into
a science of this",00:32:54.490,00:32:56.050
"where they're
certain cosmic rays",00:32:56.050,00:32:58.512
"or whatever hitting the
earth and the frequency",00:32:58.512,00:33:00.470
"they try to get random
numbers out of it",00:33:00.470,00:33:02.136

of clocks and stuff",00:33:02.136,00:33:04.220
"like that, the tiny
low order bits.",00:33:04.220,00:33:07.090
"Actually getting really
independent random numbers",00:33:07.090,00:33:10.069
can be challenging.,00:33:10.069,00:33:10.860
"A lot of the things you do
with a computer generating",00:33:10.860,00:33:13.140
"random numbers, they're
distributed nicely,",00:33:13.140,00:33:16.140
"but they're not
mutually independent.",00:33:16.140,00:33:17.850
"And there's whole texts
that go into how to do",00:33:17.850,00:33:20.250
that for mutual independence.,00:33:20.250,00:33:22.385
"Getting something that's
fair for one of them",00:33:22.385,00:33:24.260
is not too hard.,00:33:24.260,00:33:27.100
Any questions about that?,00:33:27.100,00:33:30.920
There's another example.,00:33:30.920,00:33:32.970
"How many people
ever participated",00:33:32.970,00:33:34.920
in a Super Bowl bet?,00:33:34.920,00:33:38.090
"OK, like maybe you're trying to
guess the over under on point",00:33:38.090,00:33:40.810
scored.,00:33:40.810,00:33:42.930
"And the person who guesses close
to the total number of points",00:33:42.930,00:33:47.050
wins the pot.,00:33:47.050,00:33:48.370
"And if there's a
tie, it's shared.",00:33:48.370,00:33:50.760
"So in that kind of
situation, some people",00:33:50.760,00:33:53.490
"figured out that the average
number of points scored",00:33:53.490,00:33:56.570
"in a Super Bowl is, say, 30.",00:33:56.570,00:34:00.860
"And a lot of the guesses then
will cluster around 30 points.",00:34:00.860,00:34:07.730
"Now, if you knew this and you
knew a lot of the guesses,",00:34:07.730,00:34:10.840
"because there may be people who
cared betting, where would you",00:34:10.840,00:34:13.639
"make, say, this is, I don't
know, 40 and this is 20,",00:34:13.639,00:34:16.560
where would you guess?,00:34:16.560,00:34:19.440
You could guess here.,00:34:19.440,00:34:20.480
That's a good one.,00:34:20.480,00:34:22.120
Or you could guess here.,00:34:22.120,00:34:24.620
"Not only are you not going to
share the pot, which helps you,",00:34:24.620,00:34:27.448
"but in this case you'd
actually, because being closest,",00:34:27.448,00:34:29.739
"you'd capture all
the scores out here.",00:34:29.739,00:34:32.630
So that's really good.,00:34:32.630,00:34:34.870
"So these are the best guesses to
make for your expected return,",00:34:34.870,00:34:38.198
"assuming everybody is guessing
around here because they",00:34:38.198,00:34:40.489
know that's the median.,00:34:40.489,00:34:41.880
Yeah?,00:34:41.880,00:34:42.846
"AUDIENCE: But those scores
aren't likely to happen.",00:34:42.846,00:34:45.384
"PROFESSOR: They're
not likely to happen,",00:34:45.384,00:34:47.050
"but it can outweigh splitting
the pot with all the people",00:34:47.050,00:34:51.159
that guessed here.,00:34:51.159,00:34:53.870
And you get to cover more bases.,00:34:53.870,00:34:56.744
"So you're right, they're
less likely to happen",00:34:56.744,00:34:58.660
"because so many people guessed
in here where it's likely.",00:34:58.660,00:35:02.170
"Your expected return
is better out here.",00:35:02.170,00:35:05.790
"You may not be likely
to win, but your payoff",00:35:05.790,00:35:08.750
will be very large when you do.,00:35:08.750,00:35:11.790
"Now, if you're in
a bet or a pool",00:35:11.790,00:35:14.590
"with a bunch of 6042
students and they're all",00:35:14.590,00:35:17.400
"guessing out here, well then
you want to go back home here.",00:35:17.400,00:35:22.542
Then it's better.,00:35:22.542,00:35:23.250
"So it all depends on what
that distribution looks like.",00:35:23.250,00:35:28.800
"All right, any more
questions about this?",00:35:28.800,00:35:31.660
Yeah.,00:35:31.660,00:35:32.672
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
if you're going",00:35:32.672,00:35:34.213
"to be playing a
whole bunch of times,",00:35:34.213,00:35:35.883
"and if you're only
playing once, wouldn't you",00:35:35.883,00:35:37.758
look at the most likely result?,00:35:37.758,00:35:40.158
PROFESSOR: Say that again now?,00:35:40.158,00:35:41.408
"AUDIENCE: If you're going to be
only playing once wouldn't you",00:35:41.408,00:35:43.929
"only be concerned
with the result that's",00:35:43.929,00:35:45.595
most likely to show up?,00:35:45.595,00:35:47.606
"PROFESSOR: Well, it
depends on your strategy.",00:35:47.606,00:35:49.480
"If you want the expected
gain to be maximized,",00:35:49.480,00:35:52.580
"it doesn't matter how
many times you're playing.",00:35:52.580,00:35:54.760
"And that can be very
different than maximizing",00:35:54.760,00:35:57.400
your probability of winning.,00:35:57.400,00:35:59.480
"If you want to maximize
your probability of winning,",00:35:59.480,00:36:02.210
"you're going to go right
at the center point here.",00:36:02.210,00:36:06.165
"Because if you look at the
probability distribution",00:36:06.165,00:36:08.290
"and say the probability
distribution looks like that,",00:36:08.290,00:36:12.572
"then you want to bet
here, because that's",00:36:12.572,00:36:14.280
the maximum chance of winning.,00:36:14.280,00:36:17.390
"But say so many people bet
there, you'd split 30 ways.",00:36:17.390,00:36:22.250
"Well, this divided by 30 is
smaller than this divided by 1.",00:36:22.250,00:36:27.260
"And so your expected return
will be bigger out here.",00:36:27.260,00:36:31.280
So two different things.,00:36:31.280,00:36:32.500
"Maximizing the probability
of winning and maximizing",00:36:32.500,00:36:35.160
your expected return.,00:36:35.160,00:36:36.830
Yeah?,00:36:36.830,00:36:37.394
"AUDIENCE: When you
say maximizing,",00:36:37.394,00:36:38.810
do you just do derivatives?,00:36:38.810,00:36:41.144
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, then
you could do derivatives",00:36:41.144,00:36:43.060
and all that kind of stuff.,00:36:43.060,00:36:43.840
That's right.,00:36:43.840,00:36:44.350
"Once you have the curve,
you figure it out.",00:36:44.350,00:36:46.141
Yeah.,00:36:46.141,00:36:47.820
Yeah.,00:36:47.820,00:36:48.551
"AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it
be better to maximize",00:36:48.551,00:36:50.342
"your expected value versus
the probability that you win?",00:36:50.342,00:36:56.115
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:36:56.115,00:36:56.740
"In general, you want to
maximize the expected return",00:36:56.740,00:37:01.160
"on the basis that
probably over life you're",00:37:01.160,00:37:03.170
doing lots of things.,00:37:03.170,00:37:04.950
"And that overall puts
you in a better state.",00:37:04.950,00:37:06.990
"Now, we're going
to talk about this",00:37:06.990,00:37:09.110
"some next time in terms
of taking high risk",00:37:09.110,00:37:14.750
"bets with high, high payoffs.",00:37:14.750,00:37:17.860
"That can maximize
your expected return,",00:37:17.860,00:37:20.370
"but you have a very decent
chance of losing a lot.",00:37:20.370,00:37:23.230
"And so you might not
want to go there.",00:37:23.230,00:37:24.840
"And we'll talk about
that next time we",00:37:24.840,00:37:26.423
"talk about variance and
actually what your choice is.",00:37:26.423,00:37:29.790
"Because that is a
fundamental choice you face.",00:37:29.790,00:37:32.110
"Maximizing chance of winning,
maximizing expected return.",00:37:32.110,00:37:35.760
"And of course, tied into
that is the risk of losing",00:37:35.760,00:37:37.970
"and what kind of risk
you're willing to tolerate.",00:37:37.970,00:37:40.011
"We're going to do a bunch more
examples, but before I do,",00:37:43.530,00:37:47.050
"I want to show you
some other equivalent",00:37:47.050,00:37:48.810
definitions of expectation.,00:37:48.810,00:37:49.940
"So the expected value
of a random variable,",00:38:03.650,00:38:06.150
"you can also compute
it by summing over",00:38:06.150,00:38:09.290
"all possible values of
the random variable.",00:38:09.290,00:38:12.400
"x being in the range of
R. x times the probability",00:38:12.400,00:38:17.600
that R equals x.,00:38:17.600,00:38:20.330
And let's see why this is true.,00:38:20.330,00:38:22.200
It follows from the definition.,00:38:22.200,00:38:24.058
"From the definition, we
know the expected value",00:38:27.600,00:38:30.270
"is the sum over
all sample points",00:38:30.270,00:38:33.600
"of the value of the random
variable on the sample",00:38:33.600,00:38:35.970
point times its probability.,00:38:35.970,00:38:37.365
"And now we can organize this
sum by the value that R takes.",00:38:39.970,00:38:46.880
"So we're going to split
this into a double sum",00:38:46.880,00:38:50.480
"where here we're looking
first at x in the range of R.",00:38:50.480,00:38:57.330
"And then here we look at
sample points for which R",00:38:57.330,00:39:02.030
on that point is x.,00:39:02.030,00:39:04.380
"So this sum is
equivalent to this one.",00:39:04.380,00:39:07.220
"Here we're just
organizing all the sample",00:39:07.220,00:39:08.970
points for the same value of x.,00:39:08.970,00:39:10.345
"All right, now in
the inner sum, I've",00:39:28.990,00:39:32.430
"only got values for which
R w equals x, so I can just",00:39:32.430,00:39:36.140
replace this with x.,00:39:36.140,00:39:37.410
The same as before.,00:39:50.710,00:39:53.860
"Only now I've just
put x instead of Rw.",00:39:53.860,00:39:56.575
"Now I can pull the x out since
it's a constant independent",00:40:01.750,00:40:05.805
of that sum.,00:40:05.805,00:40:06.670
"Now here I'm summing up the
probability of all the sample",00:40:23.070,00:40:27.280
"points for which R of
the sample point is x.",00:40:27.280,00:40:32.100
"And that is just the
probability that R equals x.",00:40:32.100,00:40:37.890
"That's the definition of the
probability of that event.",00:40:37.890,00:40:40.540
"And so now my answer
is some overall values",00:40:40.540,00:40:44.310
"x in the range of x times
of probability R equals x.",00:40:44.310,00:40:48.177
"And that's what I
was trying to prove.",00:40:48.177,00:40:49.760
"OK, any questions about that?",00:40:55.870,00:41:00.990
"Now there are some
special cases of this",00:41:00.990,00:41:03.230
"when the random variable
is on the natural numbers.",00:41:03.230,00:41:07.917
"So the range of R is
the natural numbers.",00:41:07.917,00:41:09.625
So a corollary.,00:41:21.960,00:41:22.631
"If the random variable has a
range on the natural numbers,",00:41:25.400,00:41:33.400
"then another way to compute
the expected value of r",00:41:33.400,00:41:37.560
"is to simply sum i equals
1 to infinity i times",00:41:37.560,00:41:43.640
the probability R equals i.,00:41:43.640,00:41:45.760
"And the proof, well, it's really
just saying the same thing",00:41:48.330,00:41:51.190
here.,00:41:51.190,00:41:51.890
"I'm just summing over
the natural numbers.",00:41:51.890,00:41:54.160
"And the case with
0 doesn't matter",00:41:54.160,00:41:56.140
"because I get 0 times
the probability of 0.",00:41:56.140,00:41:58.830
"And that adds
nothing to the sum.",00:41:58.830,00:42:02.390
"So I just have to sum over the
positive integers in that case.",00:42:02.390,00:42:09.390
"All right, there's
another special case",00:42:09.390,00:42:11.620
"of this, which
makes it even easier",00:42:11.620,00:42:15.060
"sometimes to compute
the expected value.",00:42:15.060,00:42:17.600
"If R is a random variable
in the natural numbers,",00:42:39.910,00:42:46.260
"then the expected
value of R is simply",00:42:46.260,00:42:50.570
"the sum i equals 0 to
infinity of the probability",00:42:50.570,00:42:56.240
"the random variable
is bigger than i.",00:42:56.240,00:43:00.400
"Which is the same as summing
i equals 1 to infinity,",00:43:00.400,00:43:05.755
"the probability R is
bigger than or equal to i.",00:43:05.755,00:43:09.300
They're the same thing.,00:43:09.300,00:43:11.077
"For example, the first
term here, your probability",00:43:11.077,00:43:13.160
R bigger than 0.,00:43:13.160,00:43:14.750
"That's the same as saying R
is bigger than or equal to 1",00:43:14.750,00:43:18.510
and so forth.,00:43:18.510,00:43:19.220
So these are clearly the same.,00:43:19.220,00:43:22.000
"And the difference
here is we have i times",00:43:22.000,00:43:25.760
probability R equals i.,00:43:25.760,00:43:28.230
"Here we have probability
R is bigger than I,",00:43:28.230,00:43:30.990
with no i out in front.,00:43:30.990,00:43:32.120
So let's see why that's true.,00:43:32.120,00:43:33.328
"Well, we're going to work
backwards and evaluate",00:43:57.200,00:44:00.460
that sum.,00:44:00.460,00:44:02.830
"The sum i equal 0 to infinity
probability R is bigger than i.",00:44:02.830,00:44:13.350
"Well, that's the
probability R is bigger",00:44:13.350,00:44:17.250
"than 0 plus the
probability R is bigger",00:44:17.250,00:44:21.450
"than 1 plus probability
R is bigger than 2,",00:44:21.450,00:44:27.700
and so forth out to infinity.,00:44:27.700,00:44:29.133
Adding those up.,00:44:32.610,00:44:35.340
"And now I can
write this one out.",00:44:35.340,00:44:36.910
"That's the probability R
equals 1 plus the probability R",00:44:36.910,00:44:43.250
"equals 2 plus the probability
R equals 3 and so forth.",00:44:43.250,00:44:49.666
"Probability are bigger than
1 equals, well, R could be 2,",00:44:52.450,00:44:58.110
"R could be 3, and so forth.",00:44:58.110,00:45:03.760
R bigger than 2.,00:45:03.760,00:45:05.460
"Well, R could be
3, 4, and so forth.",00:45:05.460,00:45:12.010
"And so now if I
add all these up,",00:45:12.010,00:45:18.110
"well, I get 1 times
probability R equals 1.",00:45:18.110,00:45:23.780
Two of these guys.,00:45:23.780,00:45:24.910
Three of these guys.,00:45:30.810,00:45:32.400
"And you can see
the pattern here.",00:45:32.400,00:45:34.042
Before the next and so forth.,00:45:36.970,00:45:39.810
"And so we've shown that this
value equals that value, which",00:45:39.810,00:45:45.150
"is by the corollary just
the expected value of R.",00:45:45.150,00:45:54.635
"So by the corollary, we know
that the expected value of R",00:45:54.635,00:45:57.010
equals the sum up there.,00:45:57.010,00:46:00.188
"And that's the proof
of the theorem.",00:46:00.188,00:46:01.688
"Sometimes it's easier to use
that top expression there.",00:46:06.900,00:46:11.280
"And as a good example, it
gives a really easy way",00:46:11.280,00:46:15.610
"to compute the mean time
to failure in a system.",00:46:15.610,00:46:19.690
So let's do that.,00:46:19.690,00:46:20.548
"Suppose you have a system and
it fails with probability p",00:46:30.290,00:46:42.020
at each step.,00:46:42.020,00:46:45.210
"And let's assume
that the failures",00:46:45.210,00:46:47.160
are mutually independent.,00:46:47.160,00:46:50.500
"So if the system has
been going for t steps,",00:46:50.500,00:46:53.340
"it still will fail on step
t plus 1 with probability p,",00:46:53.340,00:46:56.700
"no matter what's
happened before.",00:46:56.700,00:46:59.380
"And the question is, what's
the expected number of steps",00:46:59.380,00:47:02.950
before the system fails?,00:47:02.950,00:47:04.330
"How long is it going to
live before you get a crash?",00:47:04.330,00:47:07.680
"And we're going to let R
be that random variable.",00:47:07.680,00:47:11.720
"It will be the step when
failure occurs, first failure.",00:47:11.720,00:47:17.000
"We want to know what's the
expected value of R. Mean time",00:47:25.120,00:47:28.770
to failure.,00:47:28.770,00:47:29.336
"And we're going to use
that top formula up there.",00:47:32.430,00:47:36.350
"Makes it a lot
simpler to do that",00:47:36.350,00:47:38.807
than the other definitions.,00:47:38.807,00:47:39.932
"Now, the probability
that R is bigger than i",00:47:45.010,00:47:50.130
"is the same as the
probability it did not",00:47:50.130,00:47:53.520
fail in the first i steps.,00:47:53.520,00:47:55.396
"So this equals the probability
of no failure in the first i",00:47:58.970,00:48:08.465
steps.,00:48:08.465,00:48:08.965
"Because this event,
R bigger than i",00:48:13.900,00:48:15.840
"means that the first failure
was not in the first steps,",00:48:15.840,00:48:19.840
"so the system was fine
for the first i steps.",00:48:19.840,00:48:23.380
"And because of
mutual independence",00:48:23.380,00:48:25.970
"on when failure
occurs, this is simply",00:48:25.970,00:48:29.110
"the product that we're OK,
no failure in the first step",00:48:29.110,00:48:37.140
times the probability.,00:48:37.140,00:48:38.600
"We're OK in the second step and
so forth up to the ith step.",00:48:38.600,00:48:47.800
We're OK in ith step.,00:48:47.800,00:48:49.134
"And this is where we're
using mutual independence,",00:48:52.830,00:48:55.040
"because I've gone
from a situation where",00:48:55.040,00:48:57.420
we're OK in the first i steps.,00:48:57.420,00:48:58.990
"The probability of that is the
product of the probabilities.",00:48:58.990,00:49:02.280
"We're OK in each
step individually.",00:49:02.280,00:49:04.860
So that needed independents.,00:49:04.860,00:49:06.213
"Well, what is the probability
we're OK in the first step?",00:49:09.890,00:49:13.410
"What's the probability of
no failure on step one?",00:49:17.610,00:49:21.208
"1 minus p, because p is the
probability we did fail.",00:49:21.208,00:49:24.950
"So we're OK with
probability 1 minus p.",00:49:24.950,00:49:28.120
"What is the probability
we're OK in the second step?",00:49:28.120,00:49:31.930
"1 minus p and so
forth for all i steps.",00:49:31.930,00:49:39.040
So this is 1 minus p to the eye.,00:49:39.040,00:49:42.480
"And it's usually simpler to
write that as alpha to the i",00:49:42.480,00:49:48.960
where alpha equals 1 minus p.,00:49:48.960,00:49:53.200
"Because what we've got
here now is the sum.",00:49:53.200,00:49:59.150
"Expected value of R
is a sum, i equals 0",00:49:59.150,00:50:02.360
"to infinity of that probability,
which is just alpha to the i.",00:50:02.360,00:50:10.990
"And we all know what
that sum is, right?",00:50:10.990,00:50:14.280
What's that sum?,00:50:14.280,00:50:15.040
1 over 1 minus alpha.,00:50:19.430,00:50:20.985
"And that plug back in
the alpha to be 1 minus",00:50:23.640,00:50:26.790
p is 1 over 1 minus 1 minus p.,00:50:26.790,00:50:32.702
And that's very simple.,00:50:32.702,00:50:33.660
That's 1 over p.,00:50:33.660,00:50:37.300
"So the expected time to
fail, the expected step",00:50:37.300,00:50:40.310
"of when you're going to
fail, is 1 over p where",00:50:40.310,00:50:43.210
p is the failure probability.,00:50:43.210,00:50:45.500
"So for example, if you have a 1%
chance of failing on any step,",00:50:45.500,00:50:50.120
"your mean time to
failure is what?",00:50:50.120,00:50:54.510
100.,00:50:54.510,00:50:55.322
1 over 0.01.,00:50:55.322,00:50:57.260
"So very easy to compute
mean time to failure.",00:50:57.260,00:51:01.870
Any questions about that?,00:51:01.870,00:51:06.264
"Of course, you can do it
with the other definitions,",00:51:06.264,00:51:08.430
"but the calculations are
a little more painful.",00:51:08.430,00:51:11.660
Yeah.,00:51:11.660,00:51:12.573
AUDIENCE: Why are we summing it?,00:51:12.573,00:51:13.906
"Is it like an accumulative
solution basically?",00:51:13.906,00:51:17.250
PROFESSOR: Why are we summing?,00:51:17.250,00:51:18.860
"Well, that's the definition.",00:51:18.860,00:51:20.830
"The theorem says the expected
value of a random variable",00:51:20.830,00:51:25.930
"is the sum of the probability
that it's bigger than i.",00:51:25.930,00:51:30.832
That's what the theorem says.,00:51:30.832,00:51:32.040
"So we're just plugging
into the theorem.",00:51:32.040,00:51:34.540
"And then the theorem
was proved based",00:51:34.540,00:51:37.420
"on the corollary, which came
from the theorem and then",00:51:37.420,00:51:42.020
the definition.,00:51:42.020,00:51:43.129
"So we went through
a series of steps.",00:51:43.129,00:51:44.670
"We started with a definition
of expected value, which",00:51:44.670,00:51:47.510
makes sense.,00:51:47.510,00:51:48.599
"Then we got another
way to compute it",00:51:48.599,00:51:50.140
based on that definition.,00:51:50.140,00:51:51.181
"And then a corollary
to that and then",00:51:53.770,00:51:56.782
"we use the corollary
to prove another way",00:51:56.782,00:51:58.490
of computing expected values.,00:51:58.490,00:51:59.710
"We went through a
bunch of general steps",00:51:59.710,00:52:01.754
"and then we used, basically
you could use this",00:52:01.754,00:52:03.670
"as a definition of this
point for expected value.",00:52:03.670,00:52:06.354
"And it just says you
sum those things up",00:52:06.354,00:52:08.020
and you get the answer.,00:52:08.020,00:52:08.978
Any other questions?,00:52:12.510,00:52:13.568
"OK, there's a variation
on this problem",00:52:16.990,00:52:19.380
"that you see all the time
in sort of trick questions",00:52:19.380,00:52:22.890
"or in the popular
press sometime, that",00:52:22.890,00:52:25.650
often confuses people.,00:52:25.650,00:52:27.220
"People sometimes think
of it as a paradox,",00:52:27.220,00:52:29.630
though it's not really one.,00:52:29.630,00:52:31.930
"And the example's something
like the following.",00:52:31.930,00:52:34.060
"Say that a couple, they're
going to have kids.",00:52:34.060,00:52:36.610
"What they really
want is a baby girl.",00:52:36.610,00:52:38.890
"They get a boy,
fine, but that's not",00:52:38.890,00:52:40.390
what they're concerned about.,00:52:40.390,00:52:41.598
They want to have a baby girl.,00:52:41.598,00:52:43.440
"And let's say that
each time they have",00:52:43.440,00:52:45.310
a kid it's 50-50 boy or girl.,00:52:45.310,00:52:48.300
"And let's say that it's
mutually independent from one",00:52:48.300,00:52:51.710
"kid to the next, which
is not true in practice.",00:52:51.710,00:52:54.380
There tends to be correlation.,00:52:54.380,00:52:55.735
"But let's assume it's
mutually independent from one",00:52:55.735,00:52:57.860
kid to the next.,00:52:57.860,00:52:59.500
"Now, if on the first
try a couple get a girl,",00:52:59.500,00:53:03.750
"great, they're done, they
have one kid, that's it,",00:53:03.750,00:53:06.110
because they just wanted a girl.,00:53:06.110,00:53:07.680
"If they get a boy,
OK, try again.",00:53:07.680,00:53:11.140
"And they keep trying again
until they get the girl,",00:53:11.140,00:53:14.890
even if it's 50 kids.,00:53:14.890,00:53:16.480
"They wait till
they get the girl.",00:53:16.480,00:53:18.570
"And the question is,
how many baby boys",00:53:18.570,00:53:21.830
"do you expect to get
before you have the girl?",00:53:21.830,00:53:27.190
what's?,00:53:27.190,00:53:27.690
"The expected number of boys to
get the girl, then you quit?",00:53:27.690,00:53:32.461
So let's do that.,00:53:32.461,00:53:37.331
So we want to know.,00:53:48.070,00:53:49.735
We have the following data.,00:53:49.735,00:53:52.690
The probability of a boy is 1/2.,00:53:52.690,00:53:57.860
"You keep having boys until
you get a girl, then you quit.",00:53:57.860,00:54:00.838
"We're going to let R
be the random variable",00:54:06.840,00:54:10.527
for the number of boys.,00:54:10.527,00:54:11.485
"And everything is mutually
independent from one child",00:54:14.050,00:54:21.290
to the next.,00:54:21.290,00:54:23.300
"How many people think you expect
to have more boys than the one",00:54:23.300,00:54:28.430
girl?,00:54:28.430,00:54:30.330
"You keep having boys
till you get the girl.",00:54:30.330,00:54:32.680
Most people think this.,00:54:32.680,00:54:33.880
"How many people think you expect
to have fewer than one boy?",00:54:33.880,00:54:39.390
Nobody.,00:54:39.390,00:54:40.630
"How many people think you
expect to have an equal number?",00:54:40.630,00:54:43.136
Expect one boy.,00:54:43.136,00:54:44.160
"Good, OK, so that's the answer.",00:54:44.160,00:54:46.140
"In fact, you expect
to have just one boy.",00:54:46.140,00:54:48.700
"And the proof, we sort
of just did it here.",00:54:48.700,00:54:52.859
"Now, in this case,
we're going to set it up",00:54:52.859,00:54:54.650
as a mean time to failure.,00:54:54.650,00:54:56.460
Same kind of thing.,00:54:56.460,00:54:58.480
"Now, in this case the failure
mode, they want the girl,",00:54:58.480,00:55:01.950
"but that's when you stop,
so that's the failure mode.",00:55:01.950,00:55:05.640
"And a working step
is you have a boy",00:55:05.640,00:55:07.210
"and you keep having the
working steps until you have",00:55:07.210,00:55:08.860
failure mode and then you stop.,00:55:08.860,00:55:10.570
"And in this case,
we're not counting",00:55:10.570,00:55:12.630
the step when you stop.,00:55:12.630,00:55:13.610
"So we know from that that
the expected value of R",00:55:13.610,00:55:19.270
"is 1 over p, which
is going to be 1/2.",00:55:19.270,00:55:22.620
"That's the number of
children you have.",00:55:22.620,00:55:26.420
"And that equals the
mean time to failure.",00:55:26.420,00:55:30.170
Minus the girl.,00:55:30.170,00:55:34.250
"Because you count the girl
as one of the children.",00:55:34.250,00:55:37.810
"And that's going to be the
expected number of boys.",00:55:37.810,00:55:40.039
"So number of children
you're expected",00:55:40.039,00:55:41.580
to have minus the girl.,00:55:41.580,00:55:43.880
This is 1 over 1/2.,00:55:43.880,00:55:44.770
And that is 2 minus 1 equals 1.,00:55:49.115,00:55:53.330
"So you expect to have one
boy before you get the girl.",00:55:53.330,00:55:58.770
Any questions on that?,00:55:58.770,00:56:02.930
"OK, how about this?",00:56:02.930,00:56:06.180
"Some couples want to have
at least one of each sex.",00:56:06.180,00:56:09.840
"They want to have at least
one boy and one girl.",00:56:09.840,00:56:13.530
"So they keep having children
until they get one of each",00:56:13.530,00:56:16.170
and then they stop.,00:56:16.170,00:56:18.170
"How many children do
they expect to have?",00:56:18.170,00:56:20.210
Somebody said two.,00:56:25.910,00:56:27.580
That's a minimum number.,00:56:27.580,00:56:30.820
"So it's not likely to
be the expected number.",00:56:30.820,00:56:34.380
Three.,00:56:34.380,00:56:35.580
"Well, OK, who said three?",00:56:35.580,00:56:37.730
Why do you think three?,00:56:37.730,00:56:39.030
"AUDIENCE: Because you have to
have at least the first two,",00:56:39.030,00:56:42.848
so it can be greater than one.,00:56:42.848,00:56:45.820
"I mean, one probability
is greater than one child,",00:56:45.820,00:56:48.302
"one probability is
greater than two children.",00:56:48.302,00:56:50.534
"And after that it's halves
which add up to one.",00:56:50.534,00:56:55.080
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.",00:56:55.080,00:56:56.330
That's a good proof.,00:56:56.330,00:56:57.163
Very good.,00:56:57.163,00:56:58.000
That'll work.,00:56:58.000,00:56:58.850
"Yeah, yeah.",00:56:58.850,00:56:59.838
"AUDIENCE: I have a
question about what",00:56:59.838,00:57:01.421
you were doing before.,00:57:01.421,00:57:02.383
"If you were to switch your
expectations for a girl",00:57:02.383,00:57:05.429
"and boy, wouldn't it come
out to the same number",00:57:05.429,00:57:07.674
"but wouldn't it kind
of contradict itself?",00:57:07.674,00:57:10.570
"PROFESSOR: No, if you stopped
as soon as you had a boy,",00:57:10.570,00:57:12.940
"you'd expect to have one
girl before you got a boy.",00:57:12.940,00:57:15.780
Totally symmetric.,00:57:15.780,00:57:17.057
"In this case, we're stopping
when we get the girl,",00:57:17.057,00:57:19.140
so we expect to have one boy.,00:57:19.140,00:57:21.560
"You might have none, you might
have one, you might have two.",00:57:21.560,00:57:24.354
"and as he mentions, if you put
the probabilities in there,",00:57:24.354,00:57:26.770
"they will work
out the right way,",00:57:26.770,00:57:28.000
"but we just did it simpler
by the mean time to failure.",00:57:28.000,00:57:30.291
"And in fact, there's
also another proof,",00:57:32.840,00:57:34.910
what you're doing.,00:57:34.910,00:57:37.220
"Another way to think
about how many kids",00:57:37.220,00:57:39.530
you have to get one of each.,00:57:39.530,00:57:41.400
Well you have the first kid.,00:57:41.400,00:57:43.880
"And now you have this
problem, because you",00:57:43.880,00:57:47.260
want one of the other sex.,00:57:47.260,00:57:49.200
"And you keep on trying to
get one of the other sex",00:57:49.200,00:57:51.980
"and you expect to
have two children",00:57:51.980,00:57:55.850
to get one of the other sex.,00:57:55.850,00:57:57.090
So you have one to start.,00:57:57.090,00:57:58.420
Whatever it is doesn't matter.,00:57:58.420,00:57:59.760
"And now you expect
to have two more",00:57:59.760,00:58:01.690
until you hit the other sex.,00:58:01.690,00:58:03.280
"So a total of three is the
expected number of children",00:58:03.280,00:58:05.970
"to get one boy and
one girl, at least.",00:58:05.970,00:58:10.985
Any questions about expectation?,00:58:10.985,00:58:13.314
"OK, let's do another example.",00:58:15.980,00:58:22.010
"This comes up all the
time in experimental work.",00:58:22.010,00:58:26.120
"Probably all of you are going to
have some example at some point",00:58:26.120,00:58:29.540
"where you're going to
do a problem like this.",00:58:29.540,00:58:33.050
"And most all the time,
people do it wrong.",00:58:33.050,00:58:37.020
So let's see an example.,00:58:37.020,00:58:39.520
"Say that you want to measure the
latency of some communications",00:58:39.520,00:58:44.390
channel.,00:58:44.390,00:58:46.410
"And you want to know
what's the average latency.",00:58:46.410,00:58:49.490
So you set up an experiment.,00:58:49.490,00:58:52.570
"You send a package
to the channel,",00:58:52.570,00:58:54.180
"you measure when it started,
when it got to the other end,",00:58:54.180,00:58:56.740
"and you record the answer,
and then you do it 100 times",00:58:56.740,00:59:00.900
and you take the average.,00:59:00.900,00:59:02.940
"And you say that's the expected
latency of the channel.",00:59:02.940,00:59:06.270
"Very, very typical kind of thing
to do, and sometimes OK to do.",00:59:06.270,00:59:10.827
So you'd do something like this.,00:59:10.827,00:59:12.160
"You pick a random
variable D, which",00:59:12.160,00:59:15.690
"is going to denote the
delay of a packet going",00:59:15.690,00:59:23.197
through the channel.,00:59:23.197,00:59:24.030
"And there's, of course,
some underlying distribution",00:59:28.560,00:59:31.010
"here, which we'll
denote by f of x.",00:59:31.010,00:59:35.990
"And that's just the
probability that D equals x.",00:59:35.990,00:59:38.500
"That's the probability
distribution function.",00:59:38.500,00:59:40.510
"And as part of doing
your stuff, you",00:59:46.450,00:59:49.120
"notice that if I
look at plot f here,",00:59:49.120,00:59:52.110
"if I look at x on that
axis and f of x here,",00:59:52.110,00:59:58.320
it looks something like this.,00:59:58.320,01:00:00.045
"The chance of
getting the observed",01:00:02.910,01:00:05.100
"cases where I got a long delay
were small, low probability.",01:00:05.100,01:00:09.290
"And almost all the time
I got a short delay.",01:00:09.290,01:00:11.890
"So very typically you'll get
a curve that looks something",01:00:11.890,01:00:14.540
"like that in terms
of the observations",01:00:14.540,01:00:17.430
of your experiment.,01:00:17.430,01:00:20.600
"And say that you do your
experiment 100 times",01:00:20.600,01:00:25.930
"and the average latency
was 10 milliseconds.",01:00:25.930,01:00:28.710
"And sometimes you want
to be really careful,",01:00:31.887,01:00:33.720
"so you do the whole thing
again, you do another 100 times.",01:00:33.720,01:00:37.150
"And maybe it's nine
milliseconds the next time.",01:00:37.150,01:00:39.190
"And that sort of
confirms your belief",01:00:39.190,01:00:41.280
"that your first
experiment was valid",01:00:41.280,01:00:43.250
"and that the expected
latency on this channel",01:00:43.250,01:00:45.430
is 10 milliseconds.,01:00:45.430,01:00:48.510
Sounds pretty good.,01:00:48.510,01:00:51.390
But it can be completely wrong.,01:00:51.390,01:00:53.710
"And not just because
you're unlucky,",01:00:53.710,01:00:55.390
"but because you're taking
a simple method like that.",01:00:55.390,01:00:57.870
"And let me show you an
example where it is way off.",01:00:57.870,01:01:04.400
"All right, say you
were just a little more",01:01:14.310,01:01:17.210
sophisticated about this.,01:01:17.210,01:01:19.350
"And when you did
your observations,",01:01:19.350,01:01:22.010
"you tried to figure out what
this curve really looks like.",01:01:22.010,01:01:26.930
"And say that you,
looking at the data,",01:01:26.930,01:01:29.090
"concluded that the probability
that you have a delay of more",01:01:29.090,01:01:33.330
than i milliseconds is 1 and i.,01:01:33.330,01:01:37.610
"That looks like this curve,
as close as anything.",01:01:37.610,01:01:41.480
"So from your data,
you conclude this.",01:01:41.480,01:01:45.234
"That's a little more
sophisticated conclusion,",01:01:45.234,01:01:47.150
"because now you've
identified what",01:01:47.150,01:01:49.300
"you believe the
distribution is, which",01:01:49.300,01:01:51.560
is stronger than expectation.,01:01:51.560,01:01:55.000
"How would you go about
figuring out the expected value",01:01:55.000,01:01:58.754
if you had that information?,01:01:58.754,01:01:59.920
"I mean, you could average
the 100 sample points.",01:02:03.800,01:02:06.380
"But is there any way, if you
assume this, what would you",01:02:06.380,01:02:10.550
do for the expected value?,01:02:10.550,01:02:14.680
"Yeah, did I erase the theorem?",01:02:14.680,01:02:16.500
"No, it's over there.",01:02:16.500,01:02:18.870
We just plug it to the theorem.,01:02:18.870,01:02:22.190
"The expected delay
is going to be",01:02:22.190,01:02:23.590
"the sum of those probabilities
from 1 to infinity.",01:02:23.590,01:02:29.800
"So we would compute
from the theorem",01:02:29.800,01:02:32.760
"the expected delay is i equals
1 to infinity probability.",01:02:32.760,01:02:39.626
Do I want to do the 0 case?,01:02:43.090,01:02:44.804
"Want to be sure I don't get
caught up in the 0 case.",01:02:44.804,01:02:46.970
"We'll use the case
1 to infinity.",01:02:46.970,01:02:48.560
"Probability D greater
than or equal to i.",01:02:48.560,01:02:51.070
"So let me put greater
than or equal to here.",01:02:51.070,01:02:52.960
"That equals the sum i equals
1 to infinity of 1 over i.",01:02:56.740,01:03:02.220
What's that?,01:03:02.220,01:03:03.220
"What's the sum of 1 over
i, i from 1 to infinity?",01:03:07.220,01:03:11.630
It's infinite.,01:03:11.630,01:03:13.290
Remember those harmonic number?,01:03:13.290,01:03:15.830
"i going from 1 to n
gives you about log n.",01:03:15.830,01:03:19.120
"Remember that, the
book stacking thing?",01:03:19.120,01:03:22.290
"i going from 1 to
infinity, that's infinity.",01:03:22.290,01:03:28.620
"So in fact, your expected
latency is infinite.",01:03:28.620,01:03:33.070
"And you just published a paper
saying it was 10 milliseconds,",01:03:33.070,01:03:35.720
maybe nine.,01:03:35.720,01:03:36.450
"So it's very dangerous to just
take a bunch of the points,",01:03:41.020,01:03:43.460
"add them up, and average them
and say that is the answer.",01:03:43.460,01:03:47.904
"Especially if you
have some reason",01:03:47.904,01:03:49.320
"to believe the distribution
looks like this",01:03:49.320,01:03:51.130
"and it really is
something like that.",01:03:51.130,01:03:52.671
It could be infinite.,01:03:52.671,01:03:54.844
"Now in some cases, if your
distribution is very well",01:03:54.844,01:03:57.010
"behaved, averaging
your sample points",01:03:57.010,01:03:58.970
is the perfect thing to do.,01:03:58.970,01:04:01.320
"But it helps to know it's not
necessarily the case that's",01:04:01.320,01:04:05.183
a good way to go.,01:04:05.183,01:04:06.090
Any ideas what went wrong?,01:04:09.000,01:04:10.518
Yeah.,01:04:10.518,01:04:11.018
AUDIENCE: I have a question.,01:04:11.018,01:04:12.184
"What would be your
probability be over i squared?",01:04:12.184,01:04:14.290
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, what
would happen then?",01:04:14.290,01:04:15.956
"If in fact, it was
1 over i squared.",01:04:15.956,01:04:19.700
So you need to do this sum.,01:04:23.840,01:04:26.457
"Here's a good review
question for the final.",01:04:26.457,01:04:28.290
"What method do you
use to estimate that?",01:04:28.290,01:04:30.110
Remember the how do we do that?,01:04:32.770,01:04:35.360
Is that infinite?,01:04:35.360,01:04:37.540
No.,01:04:37.540,01:04:38.580
He used the integration bound.,01:04:38.580,01:04:41.250
"And you'll see what
this is pretty small.",01:04:41.250,01:04:45.072
"It'll be, what, 1 and
a 1/2, 2, something",01:04:45.072,01:04:46.780
"like that where we can do
the integration method here.",01:04:46.780,01:04:49.660
So huge difference.,01:04:49.660,01:04:51.890
This is O of 1.,01:04:51.890,01:04:52.740
This is bounded.,01:04:52.740,01:04:54.190
"Probably less than 2, if we
did the integration method.",01:04:54.190,01:04:58.760
"So huge difference here
in what the outcome is.",01:04:58.760,01:05:02.650
"Now, how can it be
that I've got something",01:05:02.650,01:05:07.120
"with expected infinite value
and I average 100 points",01:05:07.120,01:05:12.150
and I got 10 milliseconds?,01:05:12.150,01:05:14.180
Yeah.,01:05:14.180,01:05:16.130
"AUDIENCE: The infinite
value comes from the fact",01:05:16.130,01:05:18.130
"that there is a
decent probability",01:05:18.130,01:05:20.973
that delay is going to be huge.,01:05:20.973,01:05:23.228
"However, if you only take a
finite number of sample points,",01:05:23.228,01:05:26.306
"then chances are
you're not going",01:05:26.306,01:05:28.828
to get any monstrous delays.,01:05:28.828,01:05:30.790
PROFESSOR: Exactly.,01:05:30.790,01:05:32.010
"The chance of seeing anything
beyond 100 milliseconds",01:05:32.010,01:05:34.670
is 1 in 100.,01:05:34.670,01:05:37.886
"So I'm probably
not going to see.",01:05:37.886,01:05:39.260
"In a sample size of
100, almost surely",01:05:39.260,01:05:41.530
"I won't see something that takes
a second, 1,000 milliseconds.",01:05:41.530,01:05:46.550
"But yet it's those
rare sample points",01:05:46.550,01:05:49.470
"that are causing
that sum to blow up.",01:05:49.470,01:05:52.620
"If I sum that from 1 to
100, I get log of 10.",01:05:52.620,01:05:56.150
Pretty small.,01:05:56.150,01:05:56.742
"So I get log of 100,
which is pretty small.",01:05:59.300,01:06:04.082
"So what's happening when
you do your finite sample is",01:06:04.082,01:06:06.290
"you're missing
the big guys which",01:06:06.290,01:06:08.950
"are very rare, but enough
to blow up your expectation.",01:06:08.950,01:06:12.130
"Now, you can draw two
conclusions from that.",01:06:12.130,01:06:15.020
One of them is just we did.,01:06:15.020,01:06:16.250
"The other is,
well, expectation's",01:06:16.250,01:06:17.640
the wrong measure.,01:06:17.640,01:06:18.534
"And really what

this is it.,01:07:36.100,01:07:36.600

it is and then you get",01:07:47.470,01:07:49.700

you take the various cases",01:07:49.700,01:07:53.050

the most important theorem",01:08:53.020,01:08:55.319
on probability.,01:08:55.319,01:08:55.973
"For any random variables, R1 and
R2, on a probability space S,",01:08:58.810,01:09:13.420

equals the expected value of R1",01:09:13.420,01:09:21.890
plus the expected value of R2.,01:09:21.890,01:09:26.290
Very simple.,01:09:26.290,01:09:27.547
"It's another way of
saying expectation",01:09:27.547,01:09:29.130
is a linear function.,01:09:29.130,01:09:32.080
The proof.,01:09:32.080,01:09:32.579
"No, skip the proof here.",01:09:37.109,01:09:38.330
"It's not hard and
it's in the text.",01:09:38.330,01:09:39.981
"Follows pretty simply
from the definition.",01:09:43.760,01:09:45.864
"There's a generalization for
more than two random variables.",01:09:53.250,01:09:57.067
So corollary.,01:09:59.810,01:10:00.997
"For all k in the natural numbers
and k random variables R1,",01:10:03.990,01:10:12.390
"R2, up to Rk on the
sample probability space",01:10:12.390,01:10:18.920
"S. The expected value of
R1 plus R2 plus Rk is just",01:10:18.920,01:10:28.090
the sum of the expected values.,01:10:28.090,01:10:29.465
"And the proof of that is by
induction using that result.",01:10:36.220,01:10:40.212
"And the really important
thing about this",01:10:40.212,01:10:41.920
"is that neither of these
results needs independence.",01:10:41.920,01:10:44.430
"It is true whether or not
the Ri are independent.",01:10:47.370,01:10:52.764
"Pretty much everything
we do in probability",01:10:58.850,01:11:01.190
"to manipulate random variables
needs them to be independent.",01:11:01.190,01:11:04.530
You don't need that here.,01:11:04.530,01:11:06.050
"And that'll make
it very powerful.",01:11:06.050,01:11:08.412
So let's do an example.,01:11:08.412,01:11:09.370
Say I roll two fair dice.,01:11:28.370,01:11:32.446
Six sided dice.,01:11:35.780,01:11:36.720
Not necessarily independent.,01:11:42.320,01:11:45.360
"R1 is the outcome
on the first die.",01:11:45.360,01:11:48.730
"And R2 will be the
outcome on the second one.",01:11:53.990,01:12:00.740
"And I'm interested in
the sum of the dice.",01:12:00.740,01:12:04.680
"So with that R
it'd be R1 plus R2.",01:12:04.680,01:12:08.470
"And I want to know the expected
value of the sum of the dice",01:12:08.470,01:12:12.062
when I roll them.,01:12:12.062,01:12:12.770
"Now, if I didn't
use that theorem",01:12:16.280,01:12:20.260
"I'd compute the tree
in the sample space.",01:12:20.260,01:12:22.740
"I'd get 36 possible outcomes,
take the probability of each.",01:12:22.740,01:12:27.360
"It'd take you a
little while to do it,",01:12:27.360,01:12:29.210
"but using linearity of
expectation, it's easy.",01:12:29.210,01:12:33.320
"It's expected value of R1
plus the expected value of R2.",01:12:33.320,01:12:38.070
"Each of these we already
figured out is 3 and 1/2.",01:12:38.070,01:12:43.230
And so the answer is 7.,01:12:43.230,01:12:46.330
"So if you roll a pair
of dice, whether or not",01:12:46.330,01:12:49.170
"they are independent, the
expected sum is seven.",01:12:49.170,01:12:52.721

what is the random variable?,01:14:14.924,01:14:16.090
"R1 is the case
when you get a boy.",01:14:16.090,01:14:17.820

"R2 is the indicator
for getting a girl.",01:14:19.940,01:14:22.790
"R1 plus R2 is by

because you got a boy or a girl.,01:14:25.310,01:14:26.760

kind of game.",01:14:29.920,01:14:32.690

easier for things like that.",01:14:36.440,01:14:39.305

"This problem we call
the hat check problem.",01:14:44.180,01:14:46.230
"And the idea here
behind this is say",01:14:51.560,01:14:54.250
"that you have n men at a
restaurant having dinner.",01:14:54.250,01:14:59.350

into the restaurant,",01:14:59.350,01:15:01.110
"they check their hats
in the coat room.",01:15:01.110,01:15:04.360

wrong in the coat room",01:15:04.360,01:15:06.790
"and the hats are all
scrambled up randomly.",01:15:06.790,01:15:10.200
"Let's say a random
permutation of the hats.",01:15:10.200,01:15:13.010
"So the men come back
to get their hats",01:15:13.010,01:15:15.480
"and they get a random
hat coming back.",01:15:15.480,01:15:19.370
"So each man gets a random
hat back after dinner.",01:15:19.370,01:15:31.220
"And the question is, what is
the expected number of men",01:15:31.220,01:15:35.520
to get the right hat back?,01:15:35.520,01:15:37.331
"So we let R be the
random variable",01:15:39.980,01:15:41.840
"that says the
number of men to get",01:15:41.840,01:15:45.590
"the right hat, their happen.",01:15:45.590,01:15:49.162
"And we want to know the
expected value of R.",01:15:52.000,01:15:57.140
"Now, from the
definition, that's just",01:15:57.140,01:15:58.850
the sum of all possibilities.,01:15:58.850,01:16:01.570
K from 1 to n.,01:16:01.570,01:16:04.556

probability R equals k.",01:16:04.556,01:16:09.100

the definitions, we",01:16:09.100,01:16:12.330
"could compute the
expected value this way.",01:16:12.330,01:16:14.310
"In fact, if you were to
be assigned this on a test",01:16:14.310,01:16:17.820
"or on homework, that's
probably how you'd",01:16:17.820,01:16:19.770
start something like that.,01:16:19.770,01:16:21.010
"And then, well, the
next step you'd take",01:16:23.560,01:16:25.994
"would be to figure out what's
the probability that exactly",01:16:25.994,01:16:28.410
K men get the right hat back.,01:16:28.410,01:16:32.980
"In fact, we actually
asked this once before we",01:16:32.980,01:16:35.280
started doing it in class.,01:16:35.280,01:16:37.430
"And it was really hard if
you went down this path.",01:16:37.430,01:16:40.170
"Because if you spent all
night with your buddies,",01:16:40.170,01:16:44.230
"you would maybe get
to the conclusion",01:16:44.230,01:16:46.780
"that probability R
equals K is this.",01:16:46.780,01:16:52.330
"1 over K factorial times n minus
K down here for K less than",01:16:52.330,01:16:59.800
or equal to n minus 2.,01:16:59.800,01:17:02.680
"And 1 over n factorial if
K equals n minus 1 or n.",01:17:02.680,01:17:10.130
"Then you would plug that nasty
looking thing into there.",01:17:10.130,01:17:14.590
"So multiply by K. And
you'd have to sum it up.",01:17:14.590,01:17:18.330
And Lord help you.,01:17:18.330,01:17:19.780
That's just a nightmare to do.,01:17:19.780,01:17:22.000
"You'd have a very hard
time getting the answer.",01:17:22.000,01:17:24.640
"If you doubt that, try it.",01:17:24.640,01:17:27.980
"But that would be a
natural way to proceed.",01:17:27.980,01:17:29.964
"But it turns out there is a
trivial way to get the answer.",01:17:32.790,01:17:35.430
"And this is a very
powerful technique",01:17:35.430,01:17:37.940
using linearity of expectation.,01:17:37.940,01:17:40.200
"And for sure there will be a
problem on the final exam just",01:17:40.200,01:17:43.590
like this.,01:17:43.590,01:17:45.790
"And so if you go down this path,
which is a natural first path,",01:17:45.790,01:17:49.620
"it may take you the rest
of the day to solve it.",01:17:49.620,01:17:53.630
"But the method I'm
going to show you",01:17:53.630,01:17:55.130
"will take you a couple
minutes to do it.",01:17:55.130,01:17:57.407
"Now, the trick is to use
linearity of expectations.",01:18:02.370,01:18:05.070
"So the problem is
there's no sum here.",01:18:05.070,01:18:09.610
"So what we need to do is
we're going to express R",01:18:09.610,01:18:11.960
as the sum of random variables.,01:18:11.960,01:18:16.300
"And the way we're going
to do that is as follows.",01:18:16.300,01:18:22.740
"And it's not obvious,
but once you see it,",01:18:22.740,01:18:24.540
it's easy to keep using it.,01:18:24.540,01:18:26.094
"We let R be the sum
of R1 plus R2 plus Rn.",01:18:28.700,01:18:35.825
"And Ri is going to
tell us the event.",01:18:35.825,01:18:40.075
"This is sort of what
you were talking",01:18:40.075,01:18:42.570
"about before with the event
of a boy or event of a girl.",01:18:42.570,01:18:45.170
"This is going to be the
event of the ith man",01:18:45.170,01:18:47.580
gets his right hat back.,01:18:47.580,01:18:50.830
"So it's an indicator
random variable.",01:18:50.830,01:18:52.710
"It's 1 if the ith man
gets the right hat.",01:18:52.710,01:18:59.610
And it's 0 if he doesn't.,01:19:02.170,01:19:04.110
"So whenever the ith guy gets his
hat back, that counts as one,",01:19:10.060,01:19:14.700
"and now you can see
why this sum works.",01:19:14.700,01:19:17.095
"R is the number of men to
get the right hat back.",01:19:17.095,01:19:21.110
"And it basically there's a
one counted in here every time",01:19:21.110,01:19:24.210
"a guy gets his hat back,
and 0 if he doesn't.",01:19:24.210,01:19:28.740
"So this sum is counting how many
men got their right hat back.",01:19:28.740,01:19:33.276
"Non-obvious the first
time, gets really simple",01:19:36.280,01:19:38.980
the fourth or fifth time.,01:19:38.980,01:19:41.420

couple of them today.",01:19:41.420,01:19:43.896

value of R is easy.",01:19:48.290,01:19:52.505
"It's just by linearity
of expectation,",01:19:55.230,01:19:57.270
"expected value of
R1 and so forth",01:19:57.270,01:20:00.590

"The expected value of an
indicator random variable",01:20:05.310,01:20:10.150

that it's 1.",01:20:10.150,01:20:13.350
"Right it's 1 times
the probability,",01:20:13.350,01:20:15.040
"it's 0 times the
probability of 0.",01:20:15.040,01:20:17.484

"What's the probability that the
first man gets the right hat",01:20:28.650,01:20:31.680
back?,01:20:31.680,01:20:34.400
1 over n.,01:20:34.400,01:20:35.080
There's n hats.,01:20:35.080,01:20:35.730
He gets a random one.,01:20:35.730,01:20:38.820
"What's the probability that the
second man gets his hat back?",01:20:38.820,01:20:41.607
Not 1 over n minus 1.,01:20:44.870,01:20:47.980
"He's coming in whether he's
first, second, or last.",01:20:47.980,01:20:50.760
He gets a random hat.,01:20:50.760,01:20:53.630
1 in n chance it's his.,01:20:53.630,01:20:55.310
"What's the probability the last
man gets the right hat back?",01:20:59.340,01:21:04.660
One over n.,01:21:04.660,01:21:05.200
"Doesn't really matter
if he's first or last.",01:21:05.200,01:21:07.033
"Just sort of tricks
up a little bit.",01:21:07.033,01:21:09.030
He's getting a random hat back.,01:21:09.030,01:21:11.480
So it's 1 over n.,01:21:11.480,01:21:12.470
"I got n of each, 1
over n, so what's",01:21:15.330,01:21:17.880
"the expected number of men
to get the right hat back?",01:21:17.880,01:21:21.170
One.,01:21:21.170,01:21:23.290
"Now, the math doesn't get
much easier than that.",01:21:23.290,01:21:26.680
"Now, the amazing
thing is we just",01:21:26.680,01:21:29.480
"proved that if we take
that mess, stick it in here",01:21:29.480,01:21:34.730
"and sum it up, what
answer do we get?",01:21:34.730,01:21:38.610
1.,01:21:38.610,01:21:39.900
"That is certainly not obvious,
but that is a consequence",01:21:39.900,01:21:42.310
of everything we've just done.,01:21:42.310,01:21:44.240
"We've just given a probability
proof of that fact.",01:21:44.240,01:21:47.560
"But the nice thing here
is there's actually",01:21:47.560,01:21:50.170
even more powerful.,01:21:50.170,01:21:52.920
"Did I need to assume that it
was a random permutation of hats",01:21:52.920,01:21:56.870
"like I would need
to assume for this?",01:21:56.870,01:21:58.600
No independence is needed.,01:22:03.180,01:22:06.040
"In fact, there's all sorts
of distributions that will",01:22:06.040,01:22:09.350
give the same expected value.,01:22:09.350,01:22:11.140
"All I need is that each
person gets the right hat back",01:22:11.140,01:22:14.220
with probability 1 over n.,01:22:14.220,01:22:17.246
"In fact, this is an example
of a different distribution",01:22:17.246,01:22:19.960
"for which the
result is the same.",01:22:19.960,01:22:22.390
"Say you're at a
Chinese restaurant.",01:22:22.390,01:22:24.459
"And you know they have
the thing that spins",01:22:24.459,01:22:26.250
in the middle of the table?,01:22:26.250,01:22:28.640
"Say that you each
order an appetizer.",01:22:28.640,01:22:30.380
"There's n people and they're
around a big circular table.",01:22:30.380,01:22:32.850
Everybody gets their appetizer.,01:22:32.850,01:22:35.110
"Wonton soup, whatever.",01:22:35.110,01:22:36.930
"And then there's always the
joker who spins the thing",01:22:36.930,01:22:40.540
"and spins around
and then it stops",01:22:40.540,01:22:44.560
"and now you've got a random
appetizer in front of you.",01:22:44.560,01:22:48.480
"In this case, we
want to know what's",01:22:48.480,01:22:50.930
"the expected number of people
to get the right appetizer back.",01:22:50.930,01:22:53.920
"Not the other guys
wonton soup, but yours.",01:22:53.920,01:22:58.460
"That's a different
probability space",01:22:58.460,01:23:00.120
"because there's only n
sample points, n places where",01:23:00.120,01:23:02.362
the thing could have stopped.,01:23:02.362,01:23:03.570
Not n factorial like the hats.,01:23:03.570,01:23:08.390
"Well, does the analysis change?",01:23:08.390,01:23:12.670
Exactly the same.,01:23:12.670,01:23:14.660
"Ri is the indicator
variable for the ith person",01:23:14.660,01:23:17.320
gets the right appetizer back.,01:23:17.320,01:23:20.200
Linearity of expectation.,01:23:20.200,01:23:22.650
"The expected value of
the indicator variable",01:23:22.650,01:23:24.580
"is just the probability
that it's 1.",01:23:24.580,01:23:26.750
"And the probability
that any person",01:23:26.750,01:23:28.210
"gets the right
appetizer is 1 over n.",01:23:28.210,01:23:31.010
So the answer is the same.,01:23:31.010,01:23:32.150
"The expected number of people
to get the right appetizer",01:23:32.150,01:23:34.483
back is 1.,01:23:34.483,01:23:36.400
"So totally different
probability spaces, exactly",01:23:36.400,01:23:40.130
the same analysis and answer.,01:23:40.130,01:23:43.840
"OK, so we'll do more
of this next time.",01:23:43.840,01:23:47.260
