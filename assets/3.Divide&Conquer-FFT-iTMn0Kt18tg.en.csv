"ERIK DEMAINE: All right,
let's get started.",00:00:21.240,00:00:24.360
I am Erik Demaine.,00:00:24.360,00:00:25.510
You can call me Erik.,00:00:25.510,00:00:27.130
"Today we're going
to do another divide",00:00:27.130,00:00:29.020
"and conquer algorithm called
the fast Fourier transform.",00:00:29.020,00:00:31.970
"It's probably the most
taught algorithm at MIT.",00:00:31.970,00:00:35.870
"It's used in all
sorts of contexts,",00:00:35.870,00:00:39.300
"especially digital
signal processing",00:00:39.300,00:00:41.440
"like MP3 compression,
and all sorts of things.",00:00:41.440,00:00:45.046
"But we're going to
think about it today",00:00:45.046,00:00:46.670
"in the context of divide
and conquer and polynomials.",00:00:46.670,00:00:51.560
"So let me remind you-- I
mean, this class is all",00:00:51.560,00:00:55.540
"about polynomial time, but
usually with polynomial time",00:00:55.540,00:00:59.160
"we only care about
the lead term.",00:00:59.160,00:01:01.250
"Today-- and today
only, pretty much--",00:01:01.250,00:01:04.250
"we're going to be thinking about
all the terms in a polynomial.",00:01:04.250,00:01:09.670
"So I'll talk about
polynomials mostly a and b.",00:01:09.670,00:01:13.080
"You have a constant
term, and then",00:01:13.080,00:01:15.480
"a linear term, and a quadratic
term, and so on up to-- I",00:01:15.480,00:01:22.170
"will say that there are
n terms-- which means",00:01:22.170,00:01:24.160
the last one is a n minus 1.,00:01:24.160,00:01:28.150
"Normally the degree the
polynomial here is n minus 1.",00:01:28.150,00:01:32.320
"I wish the degree was defined
to be n here, but whatever.",00:01:32.320,00:01:35.819
"That's-- I'm not-- I can't
change the definitions",00:01:35.819,00:01:37.860
in algebra.,00:01:37.860,00:01:39.110
"So this is the
traditional algebraic way",00:01:39.110,00:01:42.060
of thinking about a polynomial.,00:01:42.060,00:01:44.680
"Of course, you can write
it with summation notation.",00:01:44.680,00:01:48.640
"akx to the k, k
equals 0 to n minus 1.",00:01:48.640,00:01:52.990
"We'll jump back and
forth between them.",00:01:52.990,00:01:54.790
"I'm also going to introduce a
vector notation for polynomials",00:01:54.790,00:01:59.350
"because-- so the ai's are
real numbers, typically.",00:01:59.350,00:02:06.770
"We might change
that at some point,",00:02:06.770,00:02:09.620
"but usually-- a common
reason-- maybe you",00:02:09.620,00:02:11.904
"don't care much
about polynomials,",00:02:11.904,00:02:13.320
"but you definitely
care about vectors.",00:02:13.320,00:02:15.260
"Any kind of
one-dimensional data set",00:02:15.260,00:02:17.180
"is a string of real
numbers, like if you're",00:02:17.180,00:02:20.780
"sampling audio--
like right now we're",00:02:20.780,00:02:22.530
"recording this
microphone-- you're",00:02:22.530,00:02:25.240
"seeing lots of different--
the movement of the membrane",00:02:25.240,00:02:29.800
in this microphone over time.,00:02:29.800,00:02:32.120
"You're sampling-- whatever--
40,000 times the second.",00:02:32.120,00:02:35.875
"Each one you're
measuring a real number",00:02:35.875,00:02:37.500
about where that thing is.,00:02:37.500,00:02:38.860
"That is a sequence
of real numbers.",00:02:38.860,00:02:40.910
"Now, you can convert it into
a polynomial if you want.",00:02:40.910,00:02:43.610
They're the same thing.,00:02:43.610,00:02:44.740
"x is not necessarily
meaningful here.",00:02:44.740,00:02:46.990
"We really care about
other coefficients.",00:02:46.990,00:02:49.770
"Now, given such a
polynomial there",00:02:49.770,00:02:52.000
"are three typical
things we want to do.",00:02:52.000,00:02:55.330
"So these are the
operations on polynomials.",00:02:55.330,00:02:58.670
"I'll say why we want
to do them in a second.",00:03:04.730,00:03:08.800
"So the obvious one, if
you do care about x,",00:03:08.800,00:03:11.740
is some kind of evaluation.,00:03:11.740,00:03:14.650
"So maybe I give you
a polynomial-- a",00:03:14.650,00:03:18.140
"of x-- and I give you a
number-- let's call it x0--",00:03:18.140,00:03:23.390
"and I want to compute
what is a of x0.",00:03:23.390,00:03:26.660
"So if I plug in-- x here
is a general variable,",00:03:26.660,00:03:29.600
"but if I give you an
actual real number,",00:03:29.600,00:03:31.490
"say, for the x's, what
does that add up to?",00:03:31.490,00:03:36.060
"So, how would you
solve evaluation",00:03:39.070,00:03:41.390
"before we go to the
other operations?",00:03:41.390,00:03:43.220
There's an obvious way.,00:03:48.230,00:03:50.300
"We, you know-- you compute
all the terms and add them up,",00:03:50.300,00:03:53.580
"but if you do that
naively, computing",00:03:53.580,00:03:59.190
"x to the k-- in this form,
maybe-- computing x to the k",00:03:59.190,00:04:03.700
"maybe takes k
multiplications, and so",00:04:03.700,00:04:06.540
"the total runtime
of the quadratic,",00:04:06.540,00:04:08.139
but we can do better than that.,00:04:08.139,00:04:09.430
"I know it's 11 o'clock-- too
early in the morning think.",00:04:15.307,00:04:17.640
Yeah.,00:04:25.850,00:04:26.654
"AUDIENCE: When you've already
calculated x to the i,",00:04:26.654,00:04:28.820
"you can calculate x to the
i plus 1 by multiplying it.",00:04:28.820,00:04:31.030
ERIK DEMAINE: Good.,00:04:31.030,00:04:31.390
"Once you've computed
x to the k, you",00:04:31.390,00:04:33.230
"can compute x to the k plus
1 with one multiplication,",00:04:33.230,00:04:36.920
"and so you can compute all
x to n's in linear time",00:04:36.920,00:04:42.150
"and then you're basically
doing a dot product between x",00:04:42.150,00:04:48.300
to the k's and the a vector.,00:04:48.300,00:04:51.330
"Cool, my first Frisbee.",00:04:51.330,00:04:52.785
"So, that's one way to do it.",00:04:56.510,00:04:59.550
"There's a slightly
slicker way to write",00:04:59.550,00:05:01.360
"it called Horner's
Rule, but it's",00:05:01.360,00:05:02.850
"doing exactly the same
thing that you said.",00:05:02.850,00:05:04.641
"It's a-- this is just a nice
algebraic way of writing it.",00:05:08.410,00:05:11.950
"a of x is the same as a0 plus
x times a1 plus x times a2",00:05:11.950,00:05:18.580
"plus, and so on.",00:05:18.580,00:05:21.340
"x times a n minus 1, and then
lots of-- close parentheses.",00:05:21.340,00:05:28.250
"So this is, of course,
equivalent to that expression",00:05:28.250,00:05:31.380
"by the law of distribution,
and this is essentially doing",00:05:31.380,00:05:36.440
the x-products one at a time.,00:05:36.440,00:05:38.940
"So, this is clearly order n
additions and multiplication,",00:05:38.940,00:05:41.890
so we get order n time.,00:05:41.890,00:05:45.530
"In this lecture,
time is the number",00:05:45.530,00:05:48.260
of arithmetic operations.,00:05:48.260,00:05:50.065
That's our model.,00:05:50.065,00:05:50.950
"Assume it takes constant
time to multiply or add",00:05:50.950,00:05:54.850
two real numbers.,00:05:54.850,00:05:55.675
OK.,00:06:00.971,00:06:01.470
Cool.,00:06:04.550,00:06:05.050
"So, evaluation-- that's easy.",00:06:05.050,00:06:07.850
"Linear time, for today, is good.",00:06:07.850,00:06:10.330
Quadratic is bad.,00:06:10.330,00:06:12.260
We want to beat quadratic.,00:06:12.260,00:06:14.200
"OK, second thing you might
want to do with polynomials",00:06:14.200,00:06:16.690
is add them.,00:06:16.690,00:06:18.430
"The third thing
is multiply them.",00:06:18.430,00:06:21.280
"So, we're given two
polynomials-- a of x and b",00:06:21.280,00:06:25.220
"of x-- and we want to compute
a new polynomial-- c of x--",00:06:25.220,00:06:29.950
that is the summation.,00:06:29.950,00:06:31.730
How do you define the summation?,00:06:31.730,00:06:33.900
"Well, you would like
c of x to equal a of x",00:06:33.900,00:06:36.570
plus b of x for all x.,00:06:36.570,00:06:39.390
That's the definition.,00:06:39.390,00:06:41.010
"Of course, we can do it
algebraically as well",00:06:41.010,00:06:43.570
"because these are
numbers in the end--",00:06:43.570,00:06:47.110
"for any x this
evaluates to a number--",00:06:47.110,00:06:49.610
"so if we add two
polynomials of this form--",00:06:49.610,00:06:51.970
"one with ai's, one with the b
i's-- all we're doing is adding",00:06:51.970,00:06:56.660
corresponding ai's and b i's.,00:06:56.660,00:06:59.470
"So, this is easy.",00:06:59.470,00:07:02.180
"We just need ck to equal
ak plus bk for all k.",00:07:02.180,00:07:09.860
"So, again, linear
time-- no problem.",00:07:09.860,00:07:14.050
"Third operation is the exciting
one, the hard one to get good,",00:07:14.050,00:07:22.450
"otherwise this lecture would be
over in a couple more minutes.",00:07:22.450,00:07:26.840
So multiplication-- same deal.,00:07:26.840,00:07:28.930
"We're given a of x
and b of x, and we",00:07:28.930,00:07:31.730
"want to convert that into
some c of x that, for all x,",00:07:31.730,00:07:36.640
"evaluates to the product
of those two polynomials.",00:07:36.640,00:07:41.225
How do we do this?,00:07:44.720,00:07:47.750
"We can't just multiply
corresponding ak's and bk's.",00:07:47.750,00:07:53.040
"In fact, if you take
a big thing like this",00:07:53.040,00:07:54.830
"and you multiply it by
corresponding big thing-- eh,",00:07:54.830,00:07:57.520
let's do it.,00:07:57.520,00:07:58.030
This doesn't look like fun.,00:08:11.328,00:08:12.453
We get-- let's see.,00:08:17.800,00:08:19.020
"So, the constant term is just
the product-- that's easy,",00:08:19.020,00:08:22.560
"the constant terms--
but then, if I",00:08:22.560,00:08:25.070
"take this product or this
product, I get linear terms.",00:08:25.070,00:08:28.360
"So it's going to be
a1b0 plus a0b1 times x,",00:08:28.360,00:08:36.330
"and then there's
a quadratic term",00:08:36.330,00:08:38.370
"which I get from-- switch
colors-- this and this",00:08:38.370,00:08:44.960
and this.,00:08:44.960,00:08:46.170
"So there's three
things times x squared,",00:08:46.170,00:08:49.330
and that's where I get tired.,00:08:49.330,00:08:51.280
"I'm going to switch to
the summation notation.",00:08:51.280,00:08:55.875
"I didn't go to high school, but
I assume in high school algebra",00:08:55.875,00:08:58.500
you learn this.,00:08:58.500,00:09:00.720
"ck is the sum of
j equals 0 to k.",00:09:00.720,00:09:10.180
ajbk minus j.,00:09:10.180,00:09:13.770
"That's the general form
because aj came from an x",00:09:13.770,00:09:17.180
"to the j term, bk minus j came
from x to the k minus j term.",00:09:17.180,00:09:21.290
"When you multiply those
together, you get x to the k,",00:09:21.290,00:09:23.970
"so this is the
coefficient of x to the k.",00:09:23.970,00:09:26.980
Cool?,00:09:26.980,00:09:28.830
"So, that's what we'd
like to compute.",00:09:28.830,00:09:31.060
"Given a and b we want to
compute this polynomial c.",00:09:31.060,00:09:34.340
How long does it take?,00:09:34.340,00:09:35.280
We have to do this for all k.,00:09:38.816,00:09:41.780
"So, to compute the k-th
term takes order k time,",00:09:41.780,00:09:45.210
so the total time is n squared.,00:09:45.210,00:09:46.660
"So, that's not good
for this lecture.",00:09:52.370,00:09:55.620
We want to do better.,00:09:55.620,00:09:57.240
"In fact, today we
will achieve n log n.",00:09:57.240,00:10:03.920
"That's our goal-- polynomial
multiplication in n log n.",00:10:06.560,00:10:11.230
"Why do we care about
polynomial multiplication?",00:10:11.230,00:10:14.120
"Because it's equivalent
to another operation which",00:10:14.120,00:10:16.770
"we use all the time in
digital signal processing,",00:10:16.770,00:10:20.900
"image editing, all sorts
of different things,",00:10:20.900,00:10:23.530
which is convolution.,00:10:23.530,00:10:24.790
"Convolution is usually thought
of as an operation on vectors.",00:10:32.910,00:10:35.640
"So, remember this
vector notation,",00:10:44.450,00:10:48.079
"where we're just thinking
about the coefficients.",00:10:48.079,00:10:50.120
x's are kind of irrelevant.,00:10:50.120,00:10:51.420
"We're just thinking about
a sequence of real numbers.",00:10:51.420,00:10:54.380
"So, maybe that sequence of
real numbers for a represents",00:10:54.380,00:10:58.790
waveform.,00:10:58.790,00:10:59.930
"Maybe this is the
audio I'm speaking now.",00:10:59.930,00:11:03.080
"And then I take
some other waveform.",00:11:03.080,00:11:05.940
"Here I have a Gaussian
function-- e to the minus",00:11:05.940,00:11:09.890
"x squared-- and I want to
take-- for all possible shifts",00:11:09.890,00:11:15.080
"of this Gaussian
I want to compute",00:11:15.080,00:11:17.290
"the dot product
between the blackboard",00:11:17.290,00:11:19.650
and the piece of paper.,00:11:19.650,00:11:21.325
"That's some kind of
smoothing function,",00:11:21.325,00:11:22.950
"if I wanted to clean up
noise or something like that.",00:11:22.950,00:11:26.342
"You can do the same thing
on a two-dimensional image.",00:11:26.342,00:11:28.550
"It's a little harder
to think about,",00:11:28.550,00:11:30.060
"but you can map a
two-dimensional image",00:11:30.060,00:11:31.370
to a one-dimensional vector.,00:11:31.370,00:11:32.750
"And you have a
two-dimensional Gaussian--",00:11:32.750,00:11:34.458
"if you ever do Gaussian
blur in Photoshop",00:11:34.458,00:11:36.920
"this is what you're
doing-- a convolution--",00:11:36.920,00:11:39.530
"and it's used to pretend that
your lens is out of focus",00:11:39.530,00:11:43.910
when you do that.,00:11:43.910,00:11:45.640
"It's done in audio processing,
and all sorts of things.",00:11:45.640,00:11:50.090
"So, formally, you're
given two vectors",00:11:50.090,00:11:54.210
"and you want to take all
possible shifts of one vector",00:11:54.210,00:11:57.480

with the other one.",00:11:57.480,00:12:00.200
I have that written down.,00:12:00.200,00:12:01.880
"I just-- dot product, same
thing as inner product,",00:12:01.880,00:12:07.140
"which just means multiply
corresponding positions",00:12:07.140,00:12:11.244
and add them up.,00:12:11.244,00:12:11.910
"And, if you ignore
this minus sign,",00:12:22.260,00:12:24.544
"that's exactly
what this is doing.",00:12:24.544,00:12:25.960
"This is taking aj versus
bk, pretend it's plus j.",00:12:25.960,00:12:30.810
"So, that's the bj vector, but
with all possible shifts k.",00:12:30.810,00:12:34.650
We compute this for all k.,00:12:34.650,00:12:38.120
That's really cool.,00:12:38.120,00:12:39.780
"We're going to compute
it in n log n time.",00:12:39.780,00:12:42.120
"All different n shifts of b will
take the dot product with a.",00:12:42.120,00:12:45.309
"It's kind of magical
because it looks",00:12:45.309,00:12:46.850
"like you're doing
n squared work,",00:12:46.850,00:12:48.280
"but we will do it
in n log n time.",00:12:48.280,00:12:50.030
"The only issue is we
have to reverse b.",00:12:53.160,00:12:56.210
"Then the minus signs
turn into plus signs.",00:12:56.210,00:12:58.809
"And there's some
boundary conditions,",00:12:58.809,00:13:00.350
but it's basically the same.,00:13:00.350,00:13:01.710
"If we can solve
polynomial multiplication,",00:13:01.710,00:13:03.860
we can solve convolution.,00:13:03.860,00:13:05.253
Cool?,00:13:05.253,00:13:07.040
"So, that's why we care
about multiplication.",00:13:07.040,00:13:09.430
"So, how are we
going to solve this?",00:13:12.040,00:13:15.190
"What I'd like to do is talk
about alternate representations",00:13:15.190,00:13:18.760
of polynomials.,00:13:18.760,00:13:19.650
That's the next thing here.,00:13:19.650,00:13:21.270
We just did operations.,00:13:21.270,00:13:22.730
"Let's talk about
different representations.",00:13:22.730,00:13:25.140

one representation--",00:13:25.140,00:13:27.460
"it's one way to
represent polynomial--",00:13:27.460,00:13:30.177
but it's not the only one.,00:13:30.177,00:13:31.260
You probably know others.,00:13:31.260,00:13:32.310
"So, on the one hand we
have representation a",00:13:35.490,00:13:43.890
is a coefficient vector.,00:13:43.890,00:13:45.920

represent a polynomial.",00:13:52.280,00:13:56.900
"Can anyone give me another
way to represent a polynomial?",00:13:56.900,00:13:59.730

We'll check.,00:14:53.500,00:14:54.550
Yep.,00:14:54.550,00:14:55.780

"ERIK DEMAINE: Roots, yeah.",00:15:52.043,00:15:53.126
"Roots is the other
answer I was looking for,",00:15:56.320,00:15:58.790
"but it's not going to be so good
algorithmically, as we'll see.",00:15:58.790,00:16:01.951
Sorry.,00:16:01.951,00:16:02.450
"So, I can give you
a sequence of roots.",00:16:05.076,00:16:06.700
"This is the fundamental
theorem of algebra",00:16:06.700,00:16:08.450
"that every polynomial
is uniquely determined",00:16:08.450,00:16:11.590
by its set of roots.,00:16:11.590,00:16:12.980
"If you allow roots
with multiplicity then",00:16:12.980,00:16:15.680
"every polynomial of degree
n has exactly n roots.",00:16:15.680,00:16:19.420
"So, this would be some sequence
of r1 up to rn minus 1,",00:16:19.420,00:16:27.686
"and the polynomial would
be given as-- you actually",00:16:27.686,00:16:29.810
"need a constant multiplier--
but x minus r0, x minus r1.",00:16:29.810,00:16:36.920
That would be polynomial.,00:16:36.920,00:16:39.800
"The trouble with roots
is that if I give you",00:16:39.800,00:16:41.990
"a coefficient vector and I
want to compute the roots,",00:16:41.990,00:16:45.290

There is no quintic formula.,00:17:01.690,00:17:03.060
That's an old result. 1800s.,00:17:03.060,00:17:05.250
"So, going from coefficient
vector to roots",00:17:05.250,00:17:08.420
takes infinite time.,00:17:08.420,00:17:10.119
It's not so good.,00:17:10.119,00:17:11.530
"And, in particular, if we
think about our operations,",00:17:11.530,00:17:14.859
"addition becomes
really difficult.",00:17:14.859,00:17:18.000

as a sequence of roots.,00:17:22.621,00:17:23.579
I want to multiply them.,00:17:23.579,00:17:24.579

the vectors--",00:17:24.579,00:17:27.540
"taking union the vectors
of their root lists.",00:17:27.540,00:17:31.676

"I'm multiplying
the c's, I guess.",00:17:32.300,00:17:34.150
"But addition is really
hard because addition",00:17:34.150,00:17:36.190
"is sort of fundamentally
about coefficient vectors.",00:17:36.190,00:17:39.670
"And then, once
you go there-- you",00:17:39.670,00:17:42.455
"can go from roots to coefficient
vectors and add them up,",00:17:42.455,00:17:44.830
"but then there's no
relation between the roots",00:17:44.830,00:17:46.746
"of the sum of the
polynomials versus the roots",00:17:46.746,00:17:49.193

"I don't know for sure
that that's impossible.",00:17:51.975,00:17:53.850
"It's definitely very, very
hard, probably impossible.",00:17:53.850,00:17:56.505
Let me draw a little table.,00:18:02.200,00:18:04.940
"Each of these representations
has some advantages",00:18:04.940,00:18:08.170
"and a disadvantage in terms
of these three operations.",00:18:08.170,00:18:12.700
"So, on the one hand,
we have the algorithms",00:18:12.700,00:18:18.670
"we care about-- evaluation,
addition, and multiplication--",00:18:18.670,00:18:38.790
"and on the other axis we have
our representations, which",00:18:38.790,00:18:42.400
"are coefficient vectors,
roots, and samples.",00:18:42.400,00:18:52.074
"You'll see why I chose
this order in a moment.",00:18:52.074,00:18:53.990
"It makes for a
nice, pretty matrix.",00:18:53.990,00:18:55.448
"We've talked about almost
every cell in this matrix,",00:19:03.950,00:19:07.260
but let me just summarize.,00:19:07.260,00:19:08.950
"We started out just thinking
about coefficient vector,",00:19:08.950,00:19:12.310
and evaluation was linear time.,00:19:12.310,00:19:16.320
Addition was linear time.,00:19:16.320,00:19:18.600
"Multiplication, so
far, was quadratic,",00:19:18.600,00:19:20.760
"although our goal
is to make n log n.",00:19:20.760,00:19:23.820
"For roots, I just said
multiplication is easy.",00:19:23.820,00:19:28.670
"That's linear time,
addition is really hard--",00:19:28.670,00:19:34.381
"like, infinite time--
and evaluation,",00:19:34.381,00:19:38.920
I guess that's linear time.,00:19:38.920,00:19:41.910
"In fact, the way it's
written, you only",00:19:41.910,00:19:43.560
"have a linear number
of subtractions",00:19:43.560,00:19:45.070
"and multiplications, so it's
really easy to evaluate.",00:19:45.070,00:19:49.330
"And then sample vectors-- we
haven't talked much about that.",00:19:49.330,00:19:55.100
"The idea is, suppose you're
given two polynomials with",00:19:55.100,00:19:58.160
the same xk's.,00:19:58.160,00:19:59.840
We're going to fix xk's.,00:19:59.840,00:20:00.980
"All we need is that
they're distinct.",00:20:00.980,00:20:02.521
"So xk could equal
k, for example,",00:20:02.521,00:20:04.650
just a bunch of integers.,00:20:04.650,00:20:06.230
"And then we are told what
polynomial a evaluates",00:20:06.230,00:20:10.270
"to at every xk, and we're
told what polynomial",00:20:10.270,00:20:12.330
b evaluates to at every xk.,00:20:12.330,00:20:14.940
"So, we're given some yk's
and some zk's, and then we",00:20:14.940,00:20:18.790
"want to compute, say, the sum
or the product of those two",00:20:18.790,00:20:23.970
vectors.,00:20:23.970,00:20:24.850
What do we do?,00:20:24.850,00:20:26.580
"Just add or multiply the
corresponding yk and zk's,",00:20:26.580,00:20:32.030
"because if we're
told we want c of x",00:20:32.030,00:20:36.290
"to equal a of x times b of
x, or c of x to equal a of x",00:20:36.290,00:20:39.390
"plus b of x for all x, Well, now
we know what x's we care about.",00:20:39.390,00:20:42.760
We just do it at the xk's.,00:20:42.760,00:20:44.600
"That's what we're
told for a and for b,",00:20:44.600,00:20:46.590
"and so to compute c of
xk it's just the sum",00:20:46.590,00:20:50.275
or the product of yk and zk.,00:20:50.275,00:20:53.290
"So multiplication is really
easy in the sample view,",00:20:53.290,00:20:56.180
"and this is why we are
going to use this view.",00:20:56.180,00:20:59.460
"We're also going to use this
view because, as we'll see,",00:20:59.460,00:21:02.270
there's a problem.,00:21:02.270,00:21:04.270
"Addition is easy,
multiplication is easy,",00:21:04.270,00:21:08.800
evaluation is annoying.,00:21:08.800,00:21:13.130
"I can evaluate a of
x at xk for any k,",00:21:13.130,00:21:19.010
"but I can't evaluate it at
some arbitrary value of x.",00:21:19.010,00:21:23.880
That's annoying.,00:21:23.880,00:21:25.500
"I'm told at these
finite sample points,",00:21:25.500,00:21:27.210
"but now I have to
somehow interpolate.",00:21:27.210,00:21:29.100
"This is called
polynomial interpolation,",00:21:29.100,00:21:31.170
"well studied in numerical
analysis and so on.",00:21:31.170,00:21:33.620
"You can do it, but it takes
quadratic time, in general.",00:21:33.620,00:21:38.960
"The best known
algorithms are quadratic.",00:21:38.960,00:21:40.800
"So, this is bad, this
is bad, and this is bad,",00:21:43.890,00:21:52.020
so no representation is perfect.,00:21:52.020,00:21:56.380
Life sucks.,00:21:56.380,00:21:59.100
"What we'd like is to
get the best-- now",00:21:59.100,00:22:00.789
"this one is really hard to work
with because converting inter",00:22:00.789,00:22:03.330
"roots is impossible in
an arithmetic model,",00:22:03.330,00:22:08.210
"so we're going to focus
on column A and column",00:22:08.210,00:22:11.530
"C. We kind of like to take
the min of those two columns.",00:22:11.530,00:22:15.860
We won't quite get that.,00:22:15.860,00:22:17.440
"What we will get is an
algorithm for converting",00:22:17.440,00:22:20.620
"between these two
representations in n log n",00:22:20.620,00:22:23.720
"time-- it's not quite
linear, but close--",00:22:23.720,00:22:28.110
"and once we can do that,
if we want to multiply two",00:22:28.110,00:22:31.080
"things in the coefficient land
we can convert to sample land,",00:22:31.080,00:22:35.090
"do it in linear time,
and then convert back.",00:22:35.090,00:22:38.070
"So that's the magical
transformation",00:22:38.070,00:22:41.230
"we're going to cover, and it
is called the fast Fourier",00:22:41.230,00:22:43.861
transfer.,00:22:43.861,00:22:44.360
"Fast Fourier transform
is the algorithm.",00:22:44.360,00:22:46.390
"Discrete Fourier transform
is that transformation",00:22:46.390,00:22:49.691
mathematically.,00:22:49.691,00:22:50.316
Cool.,00:22:53.172,00:22:54.150

the game is converting",00:22:54.150,00:22:56.990

almost the same,",00:23:00.720,00:23:02.180

Any questions before we proceed?,00:23:05.920,00:23:08.834
Yeah.,00:23:08.834,00:23:09.808

b first then multiply?",00:23:11.680,00:23:15.564
ERIK DEMAINE: Ah.,00:23:15.564,00:23:16.550
"So, OK, the question
is, if I want",00:23:16.550,00:23:20.700
"to-- we'll get
there in a second--",00:23:20.700,00:23:22.730
"but if I want to
multiply, and it's",00:23:22.730,00:23:25.110
"so easy to do in sample land,
why don't I just sample a and b",00:23:25.110,00:23:28.480
and then multiply them?,00:23:28.480,00:23:29.550
"That's right, but [? effect ?]
sampling is not so easy.",00:23:29.550,00:23:32.690
It takes quadratic time.,00:23:32.690,00:23:34.520
Let's go there now.,00:23:34.520,00:23:35.770
"Because we have n samples to do,
each one will cost linear time.",00:23:43.290,00:23:47.950
"Remember, to evaluate a
polynomial takes linear time.",00:23:47.950,00:23:51.160
"If you want to think
of it in a matrix--",00:23:51.160,00:23:53.600
"let's enter the matrix--
then we get a big matrix.",00:23:53.600,00:24:00.725

"I'm just going to write
a bunch of these rows",00:24:47.960,00:24:51.342

Pretty simple.,00:24:58.527,00:25:01.200
"This is called the
Vandermonde matrix.",00:25:09.580,00:25:13.270

using the letter i.",00:25:47.260,00:25:49.800

"We can compute it

we suggested earlier--",00:26:05.640,00:26:07.730
"compute each term

it in quadratic time--",00:26:17.910,00:26:20.820
"I'm just computing each

"This is the same thing as
computing V times the A vector,",00:26:38.210,00:26:45.860

multiplication,",00:26:45.860,00:26:48.440
which takes n squared time.,00:26:48.440,00:26:50.630
OK?,00:26:54.100,00:26:55.000
"On the other hand--
so, that's a problem",00:26:55.000,00:26:58.110
"because we're trying to beat
quadratic multiplication,",00:26:58.110,00:27:00.730

"it doesn't matter if
this is linear time.",00:27:02.880,00:27:04.740

"One is that conversion
costs too much.",00:27:05.450,00:27:07.033

Gaussian elimination.",00:27:58.130,00:27:59.250
"Turns out inverse is
the right answer here,",00:27:59.250,00:28:01.215

would be the standard way",00:28:01.215,00:28:04.020
"to solve a linear
system like that.",00:28:04.020,00:28:06.360
"The trouble with
Gaussian elimination",00:28:06.360,00:28:09.250
"is it takes cubic time
in its normal form.",00:28:09.250,00:28:16.080
"In this case it's a
little bit special",00:28:16.080,00:28:17.780
"because this matrix
is essentially fixed.",00:28:17.780,00:28:19.830

or something, so we can--",00:28:22.130,00:28:26.720
"in this case it's
a little better",00:28:26.720,00:28:28.160
to compute the inverse first.,00:28:28.160,00:28:30.320
"So we could also just
do v inverse times a.",00:28:30.320,00:28:35.451
"From a numerical analysis
standpoint this is very bad,",00:28:35.451,00:28:37.700

about it for now.",00:28:37.700,00:28:39.120
"We're going to get a
better algorithm today.",00:28:39.120,00:28:41.070
"Anyway, it doesn't
involve matrices at all,",00:28:41.070,00:28:43.780

is, if computing",00:28:43.780,00:28:45.980
"the inverse, that
takes n cubed time,",00:28:45.980,00:28:47.657
but you only have to do it once.,00:28:47.657,00:28:48.990
"So if you have to
do this many times",00:28:48.990,00:28:51.150
"you can do this product
in n squared time.",00:28:51.150,00:28:53.840
"You just have to maintain that
v inverse once and for all.",00:28:53.840,00:28:59.300
"OK, great.",00:28:59.300,00:29:00.250

quadratic algorithms",00:29:00.250,00:29:01.820
"to go back and forth between
these representations.",00:29:01.820,00:29:03.960
"That, at least,
tells us it's doable,",00:29:03.960,00:29:06.110
"but we, of course,
need better than",00:29:06.110,00:29:09.600
"quadratic to improve on the
naive multiplication algorithm,",00:29:09.600,00:29:14.526

we're going to do.",00:29:14.526,00:29:15.900
"In general, we
can't do any better,",00:29:18.740,00:29:20.730

which is we have said nothing",00:29:20.730,00:29:24.960
about the x case.,00:29:24.960,00:29:26.430
"We can choose them to be
whatever we want them to be.",00:29:26.430,00:29:29.770
I keep saying xk equals k.,00:29:29.770,00:29:31.800
That seems fine.,00:29:31.800,00:29:32.930
"It's actually really bad choice
for a reason we will get to,",00:29:32.930,00:29:36.200
"but there is a choice where,
magically, this transformation",00:29:36.200,00:29:39.210
"becomes easy and you can
do it in n log n time.",00:29:39.210,00:29:43.910
"Before we get there,
I want to give you",00:29:43.910,00:29:48.310
"some motivation for how
this could possibly work.",00:29:48.310,00:29:54.160
"As you might expect, even just
from that n log n running time,",00:30:15.140,00:30:18.680
"we're going to be using
divide and conquer,",00:30:18.680,00:30:23.930
"so let's just think about how
divide and conquer could work.",00:30:23.930,00:30:28.780
"I'm going to show
you an idea and then",00:30:28.780,00:30:31.190
"we'll figure out how that
idea could possibly work.",00:30:31.190,00:30:33.760
"It doesn't work at
the moment, but we",00:30:33.760,00:30:36.190
"will be able to choose
the xk so that it works.",00:30:36.190,00:30:40.210
"So, let's say the goal-- I mean,
what we want to do is compute",00:30:40.210,00:30:45.490
this v times a.,00:30:45.490,00:30:47.880
"I'm going to convert-- think of
that back into polynomial land.",00:30:47.880,00:30:54.110
"So our goal is to compute a
of x for all x in some set x.",00:30:54.110,00:31:01.270
"This is taking a
bunch of samples.",00:31:05.050,00:31:10.420
"Set x is just a set
of the xk's, but I'm",00:31:10.420,00:31:13.580
"going to change that set in
a moment using recursion.",00:31:13.580,00:31:19.410
"So the input to this algorithm
is a polynomial a of x,",00:31:19.410,00:31:22.390
"and it's a set
capital X of positions",00:31:22.390,00:31:26.520
"that I'd like to evaluate
that polynomial at.",00:31:26.520,00:31:28.420
"This is clearly more
general than the problem",00:31:28.420,00:31:30.295
"we're trying to solve, and I'm
going to solve it with divide",00:31:30.295,00:31:33.450
and conquer.,00:31:33.450,00:31:33.950
"In divide and conquer
there are three steps.",00:31:33.950,00:31:35.783
"Divide, conquer, and combine.",00:31:35.783,00:31:39.440
Let's start with divide.,00:31:39.440,00:31:40.640
Here's the big idea.,00:31:43.660,00:31:44.610
"I would say there
are two natural ways",00:31:47.997,00:31:49.580
to divide a vector.,00:31:49.580,00:31:50.500
"One is in the middle,
that's what we've always",00:31:50.500,00:31:52.470
"seen with merge sort and
convex hull from last time,",00:31:52.470,00:31:58.390
"but there's another way
which will work better here,",00:31:58.390,00:32:01.000
"which is the even entries
and the odd entries.",00:32:01.000,00:32:05.480
"So I'm going to divide into
even and odd coefficients.",00:32:05.480,00:32:08.820
Let me write that down.,00:32:15.410,00:32:18.150
"One of them is called a sub
even of x-- that's a polynomial.",00:32:18.150,00:32:21.860
"It's going to have half
the degree, so it's",00:32:21.860,00:32:24.440
"going to be sum from k
equals 0 to-- I wrote n here,",00:32:24.440,00:32:31.750
"but I think I want something
like n over 2 minus 1,",00:32:31.750,00:32:36.150
"n minus 1 over 2, one of those
things-- of a to k x to the k.",00:32:36.150,00:32:45.910
"So, really, what I want--
which is easier to write-- is,",00:32:45.910,00:32:49.470
"in the vector notation, I
want all the even entries.",00:32:49.470,00:32:54.762
"I won't try to figure
out what the last one is,",00:32:54.762,00:32:56.720
but it's roughly n over 2-ish.,00:32:56.720,00:32:58.120
I'll just write that.,00:33:00.750,00:33:02.220
You can go a little bit extra.,00:33:02.220,00:33:03.470
"It's fine if you define a sub
n to be 0, and a sub n plus 1",00:33:03.470,00:33:07.210
"to be zero, and all those to be
0, those terms will disappear.",00:33:07.210,00:33:10.700
"So the key thing here is
I'm taking the even entries,",00:33:10.700,00:33:13.170
but I don't have 2k up here.,00:33:13.170,00:33:18.040
This is the x to the 0 term.,00:33:18.040,00:33:20.640
This is the x to the 1 term.,00:33:20.640,00:33:21.930
This is the x to the 2 term.,00:33:21.930,00:33:24.020
"So there's a difference between
x to the k's and the sub 2k,",00:33:24.020,00:33:29.601
"but, I mean, just think
about it in vector form.",00:33:29.601,00:33:31.600
"Don't worry about
the algebra for now.",00:33:31.600,00:33:33.620
"We're going to have to
worry about it in a second,",00:33:33.620,00:33:35.703
"but, intuitively,
what I want to do",00:33:35.703,00:33:38.050
"is extract from the vector
of all the ai's these two",00:33:38.050,00:33:42.620
"vectors-- the odd
coefficients in order",00:33:42.620,00:33:48.090
"and the even
coefficients in order--",00:33:48.090,00:33:50.830
"but I'm going to need the
algebraic form in a moment",00:33:50.830,00:33:53.500
for the combined step.,00:33:53.500,00:33:54.750
It should be 2k plus 1 x to k.,00:33:58.260,00:34:01.950
That's step one.,00:34:06.684,00:34:07.350
Easy to do.,00:34:10.290,00:34:10.812
"Linear time, of course.",00:34:10.812,00:34:11.770
"Let's jump ahead to
step three, combine.",00:34:14.510,00:34:16.510
"In order to compute
a of x from-- what",00:34:20.739,00:34:24.560
"I'd like to do is
recursively compute a even",00:34:24.560,00:34:26.690
"of x and a odd of x
for some values x.",00:34:26.690,00:34:29.082
It's not going to be x and x.,00:34:29.082,00:34:30.290
It's going to be some other set.,00:34:30.290,00:34:32.469
"Let's think about
how I can compute",00:34:32.469,00:34:35.300
"a of x given some solutions
to a even of x and a odd of x.",00:34:35.300,00:34:40.739
"So this is step three, combine.",00:34:40.739,00:34:49.604
"So I would like
a of x over here,",00:34:52.780,00:35:00.040
"and I want a even of something
and a odd of something",00:35:00.040,00:35:10.880
and something in here.,00:35:10.880,00:35:13.330
Anyone see the algebra?,00:35:13.330,00:35:15.680
Maybe start with this?,00:35:19.260,00:35:20.190
I hear a mumble.,00:35:25.130,00:35:26.366
Yeah.,00:35:26.366,00:35:26.866
AUDIENCE: x squared.,00:35:26.866,00:35:27.360
ERIK DEMAINE: x squared.,00:35:27.360,00:35:28.250
Exactly.,00:35:28.250,00:35:28.750
Time for a purple one.,00:35:32.138,00:35:33.086
I'm getting better.,00:35:36.404,00:35:38.070
Why x squared?,00:35:38.070,00:35:38.970
"Because we have
this mismatch here.",00:35:38.970,00:35:41.740
We have a sub 2k.,00:35:41.740,00:35:43.290
We want x to the 2k.,00:35:43.290,00:35:45.446
How could we do that?,00:35:45.446,00:35:46.320
"Well, we could put x squared to
the 2k, and x squared to the k",00:35:46.320,00:35:54.190
"is the same thing
as x to the 2k.",00:35:54.190,00:35:58.670
"And so magically this
transforms into the even entries",00:35:58.670,00:36:03.760
of a of x.,00:36:03.760,00:36:04.790
That's half of them.,00:36:04.790,00:36:06.110
"We do the same thing for the
odd ones and we're almost there.",00:36:06.110,00:36:11.260
"Now we have a sub 2k plus 1
times x to the 2k, no plus 1.",00:36:11.260,00:36:18.180
So how can I add a plus 1?,00:36:18.180,00:36:20.617
AUDIENCE: Multiply by x.,00:36:20.617,00:36:21.900
"ERIK DEMAINE:
Multiply by x here.",00:36:21.900,00:36:25.320
"Take the whole
thing, multiply by x,",00:36:25.320,00:36:27.700
"then I get all of the
odd terms of a of x.",00:36:27.700,00:36:31.010
I add these together.,00:36:31.010,00:36:32.880
I get a of x.,00:36:32.880,00:36:35.727
"I mean, you could prove
this more carefully,",00:36:35.727,00:36:37.560
"but that's just algebra to
see that this is correct.",00:36:37.560,00:36:42.980
"Once you have this, it
tells you what I need to do",00:36:42.980,00:36:45.700
"is compute a even of x
squared for all x in x,",00:36:45.700,00:36:50.940
so this is 4x and x.,00:36:50.940,00:36:54.080
There's a for loop for you.,00:36:54.080,00:36:55.620
"So that's going to
take linear time.",00:36:55.620,00:36:57.120
"If I already know this value
and I already know this value,",00:36:57.120,00:37:00.350
"I do one multiplication,
one addition, and boom.",00:37:00.350,00:37:03.140
I get a of x.,00:37:03.140,00:37:05.760
"So in the conquer step I
want to recursively compute--",00:37:05.760,00:37:20.580
"I think I'll call it-- a even
of y, and a odd of y for y",00:37:20.580,00:37:33.460
in x squared.,00:37:33.460,00:37:35.440
"x squared is the set of
squares of all numbers in x.",00:37:35.440,00:37:39.695
So I'm changing my set x.,00:37:43.220,00:37:44.700
"I started with a
polynomial a and a set x.",00:37:44.700,00:37:48.240
"Recursively, I'm doing
a different polynomial",00:37:48.240,00:37:51.310
"of half the degree-- half
the number of terms--",00:37:51.310,00:37:57.000
"but with a different
set of the same size.",00:37:57.000,00:38:02.650
I started with x.,00:38:02.650,00:38:04.500
"x squared has the
same size as x, right?",00:38:04.500,00:38:08.300
"So let's try to figure out how
fast or slow this algorithm is.",00:38:08.300,00:38:12.995
"But that isn't
divide and conquer.",00:38:15.504,00:38:16.920
"That is going to be
our golden ticket.",00:38:16.920,00:38:20.290
"It's pretty simple, but we're
going to need another trick.",00:38:20.290,00:38:26.070
"So I'm going to
write a recurrence.",00:38:26.070,00:38:29.540
"Now, this recurrence
depends on two things.",00:38:29.540,00:38:32.720
"One is how many terms are there
in a that we've been calling n?",00:38:32.720,00:38:37.610
"And the other is how many
numbers are there in x?",00:38:37.610,00:38:40.170
"How many different places do I
have to evaluate my polynomial?",00:38:40.170,00:38:43.150
"So we've got t of n, and I
always call it size of x.",00:38:43.150,00:38:47.450
"So divide and conquer goes
hand-in-hand with recurrences.",00:38:51.680,00:38:55.620
"Generally you've got
the recursive part,",00:38:55.620,00:38:58.310
"so that's just how big
are the subproblems.",00:38:58.310,00:39:00.440
How many are there?,00:39:00.440,00:39:01.280
There are two subproblems.,00:39:01.280,00:39:03.100
"They have half the
size in terms of n,",00:39:03.100,00:39:05.910
"but they have the same
size in terms of x.",00:39:05.910,00:39:08.920
"So, all right, 2
times-- because there's",00:39:08.920,00:39:14.190
"two subproblems-- each with
size n over 2 and size x, plus",00:39:14.190,00:39:24.610
"what goes here is however much
it costs to do the divide step,",00:39:24.610,00:39:28.240
"plus however much it costs
to do the combined step-- all",00:39:28.240,00:39:30.690
the non-recursive parts.,00:39:30.690,00:39:32.620
"So this is just partitioning
the vectors-- linear scan,",00:39:32.620,00:39:35.640
linear time.,00:39:35.640,00:39:37.290
"This is-- we talked
about it-- it's",00:39:37.290,00:39:39.480
"a constant number of arithmetic
operations for each x.",00:39:39.480,00:39:43.560
"So this cause-order x time,
this cause-order n time.",00:39:43.560,00:39:48.390
"So, in general, we get n plus x.",00:39:48.390,00:39:55.560
"Now, this is, again,
not a recurrent solvable",00:39:55.560,00:39:58.252
"by the master method because
it has two variables.",00:39:58.252,00:40:00.335
"So usually when you're faced
with this sort of thing,",00:40:03.130,00:40:05.500
"you want to do back of
the envelope picture.",00:40:05.500,00:40:08.600
Draw a recursion tree.,00:40:08.600,00:40:10.110
That's a good way to go.,00:40:10.110,00:40:11.600
"So at the root-- now, I know
that initially x equals n.",00:40:11.600,00:40:16.720
"When I start out I
have n coefficients,",00:40:16.720,00:40:18.540
"I have n different positions
I want to evaluate them",00:40:18.540,00:40:21.270
"at because that's
what I want to do",00:40:21.270,00:40:23.270
"to do this conversion from
coefficients to samples.",00:40:23.270,00:40:26.490
"So at the root of the recursion
tree I'm just going to write n.",00:40:26.490,00:40:29.330
"Order n work to get started
and to do the recursions.",00:40:29.330,00:40:33.360
There are two recursive calls.,00:40:33.360,00:40:35.610
"One has som-- both have
size n over 2 in terms of a,",00:40:35.610,00:40:39.242
"and they have the same
x-- which is also known",00:40:39.242,00:40:42.670
as n-- in those two recursions.,00:40:42.670,00:40:45.340
"So in fact, the linear
work here will be n and n,",00:40:45.340,00:40:48.740
and then we'll get n and n.,00:40:48.740,00:40:50.680
"x never goes down,
so x always remains",00:40:50.680,00:40:53.100
n-- the original value of n.,00:40:53.100,00:40:56.120
This is a bad recurrence.,00:40:56.120,00:40:59.240
"There are n-- sorry,
there are log n levels.",00:40:59.240,00:41:01.855
That's the good news.,00:41:01.855,00:41:02.730
"Once we get down to constant
size we can kind of stop.",00:41:02.730,00:41:06.300
"When there's only
one coefficient",00:41:06.300,00:41:08.020
"I know how to evaluate the
polynomial with just a 0.",00:41:08.020,00:41:11.740
That's easy.,00:41:11.740,00:41:13.090
"So down at the bottom
here, at the last level--",00:41:13.090,00:41:17.010
"this is the height log n--
the last level is just, again,",00:41:17.010,00:41:20.550
"going to be a whole bunch
of n's-- all the same n.",00:41:20.550,00:41:23.440
"Here n is the original
value of x because we",00:41:23.440,00:41:25.740
haven't changed that.,00:41:25.740,00:41:27.246
"How many n's are
there down here?",00:41:27.246,00:41:28.620
AUDIENCE: 2 to the log n.,00:41:33.629,00:41:34.670
"ERIK DEMAINE: 2 to the
log n, also known as n.",00:41:34.670,00:41:36.586
Good.,00:41:40.681,00:41:41.180
"So we had-- because
we had log n levels,",00:41:41.180,00:41:44.410
"we had binary branching, so
it's 2 to the number of levels,",00:41:44.410,00:41:47.830
which is just n.,00:41:47.830,00:41:49.100
So this is n squared.,00:41:49.100,00:41:54.180
"All this work, still n squared.",00:41:54.180,00:41:56.095
"Clearly what we need is
for x to get smaller, too.",00:42:01.540,00:42:06.500
"If x-- if, in this
recursion-- let",00:42:06.500,00:42:09.750
"me, in red, draw the recursion
I would like to have.",00:42:09.750,00:42:12.365
"If x became x over
2 here, that's",00:42:15.980,00:42:18.480
the only change we'd need.,00:42:18.480,00:42:20.740
"Then n and x change in
exactly the same way,",00:42:20.740,00:42:24.640
"and so then we can
just forget about x--",00:42:24.640,00:42:26.700
it's going to be the same as n.,00:42:26.700,00:42:28.310
"Then we get 2 times n
over 2 plus order n.",00:42:28.310,00:42:33.040
Look familiar?,00:42:33.040,00:42:34.440
"It is our bread and
butter recurrence--",00:42:34.440,00:42:36.140
merge sort recurrence.,00:42:36.140,00:42:37.500
That's n log n.,00:42:37.500,00:42:39.247
That's what we need to do.,00:42:39.247,00:42:40.330
"Somehow, when we convert
our set x to x squared,",00:42:40.330,00:42:48.050
I want x to get smaller.,00:42:48.050,00:42:49.520
Is that at all plausible?,00:42:52.100,00:42:53.595
Let's think about it.,00:42:53.595,00:42:54.470
What's the base case?,00:43:04.150,00:43:06.680
"To keep things simple let's say
the base case when x equals 1,",00:43:06.680,00:43:13.210
"I'll just let x be-- let's say
I want to compute my a at 1.",00:43:13.210,00:43:19.231
Keep it simple.,00:43:19.231,00:43:19.855
What if I want two values in x?,00:43:22.810,00:43:26.007
"I'd like to have the
feature that when",00:43:26.007,00:43:27.590
"I square all the values in
x-- so I want two values,",00:43:27.590,00:43:32.080
"but when I square them
I only have one value.",00:43:32.080,00:43:34.820
Solve for x.,00:43:38.240,00:43:39.110
Yeah.,00:43:44.346,00:43:44.846
AUDIENCE: Negative 1 and 1?,00:43:44.846,00:43:45.971

"Whew, tough one.",00:43:49.320,00:43:51.264
Ehh.,00:43:51.264,00:43:52.240
Not bad.,00:43:52.240,00:43:53.470
Good catch.,00:43:53.470,00:43:55.720
Negative 1 and 1.,00:43:55.720,00:43:56.710
That could work.,00:43:56.710,00:43:58.977
What are negative 1 and 1?,00:43:58.977,00:44:00.060
They're the square roots of 1.,00:44:00.060,00:44:02.750
"Negative 1 squared
is 1, 1 squared is 1.",00:44:02.750,00:44:05.870

for every number.",00:44:07.920,00:44:09.750
Interesting.,00:44:09.750,00:44:11.480

keep taking square roots,",00:44:11.480,00:44:14.300

"set x-- or, a set is collapsing

"is the size of x divided

x squared is collapsing.,00:44:58.265,00:44:59.265
"So I need this to work all
the way down the recursion.",00:45:04.810,00:45:07.310
"Or I need a base case,
which is just x equals 1.",00:45:07.310,00:45:11.020
There's a single item in x.,00:45:11.020,00:45:12.750
"So I happened to start
with x equals the item 1.",00:45:12.750,00:45:15.610
It didn't have to be 1.,00:45:15.610,00:45:16.720

you won't get two numbers.",00:45:18.980,00:45:22.930

a power of 2 just",00:45:56.550,00:45:58.260
round up to the next power of 2.,00:45:58.260,00:45:59.680
"That only hurts me
by a factor of 2.",00:45:59.680,00:46:03.370

"Actually, the root

in front of each of these.,00:47:05.250,00:47:06.610
"I was like, there weren't
enough terms there.",00:47:06.610,00:47:08.485
"Now I've got eight-- sorry,
I've got four numbers here.",00:47:08.485,00:47:11.190
I've got four numbers there.,00:47:11.190,00:47:12.465
"How in the world
could I remember this?",00:47:12.465,00:47:15.020
Maybe I memorized it.,00:47:15.020,00:47:16.050
"No, I didn't memorize it.",00:47:16.050,00:47:17.530
"It's actually really
easy to figure this out",00:47:17.530,00:47:21.330
if you know geometry.,00:47:21.330,00:47:23.715
Geometry.,00:47:23.715,00:47:25.500
Let's do geometry over here.,00:47:25.500,00:47:27.710
It's convenient.,00:47:36.090,00:47:36.861
I'm actually a geometer.,00:47:36.861,00:47:37.860
"You know, complex numbers
have two parts, right?",00:47:43.180,00:47:45.380
"The real part and
the complex part.",00:47:45.380,00:47:47.570
"I'm going to draw that in what's
called the complex plane, where",00:47:47.570,00:47:50.560
"we draw the real
part here, and I",00:47:50.560,00:47:53.690
"guess it's usually called the
imaginary part on the y-axis.",00:47:53.690,00:47:57.260
"Every point in this plane is
a complex number, and vice",00:47:57.260,00:48:00.190
versa-- the same thing.,00:48:00.190,00:48:01.190
So what did we start with?,00:48:04.320,00:48:05.870
We started with the number 1.,00:48:05.870,00:48:08.160
Number 1 will be here.,00:48:08.160,00:48:12.510
"It has no imaginary
part, so it's",00:48:12.510,00:48:14.240
"on the x-axis-- this is
the real line down here--",00:48:14.240,00:48:17.061
"and it's at position 1, which
I'm going to just define",00:48:17.061,00:48:19.310
to be right there.,00:48:19.310,00:48:21.547
Then we've got negative 1.,00:48:21.547,00:48:22.630
That's over here.,00:48:22.630,00:48:24.650
Then we got i.,00:48:24.650,00:48:26.860
"That's here, 1 times i.",00:48:26.860,00:48:28.940
Then we've got negative i.,00:48:28.940,00:48:30.440
That's here.,00:48:30.440,00:48:33.380
"Then we've got root 2
over 2 times i plus 1.",00:48:33.380,00:48:36.660
That's here.,00:48:36.660,00:48:40.470
Root 2 over 2 by root 2 over 2.,00:48:40.470,00:48:43.060
"What is a property of root 2
over 2 comma root 2 over 2?",00:48:43.060,00:48:46.920
"It has distance exactly
1 to the origin.",00:48:46.920,00:48:50.850
"If I draw this triangle,
root 2 over 2, root 2 over 2.",00:48:50.850,00:48:57.012
I square this.,00:48:57.012,00:48:58.290
I get a half.,00:48:58.290,00:48:58.990
I square this I get a half.,00:48:58.990,00:49:00.720
"I add them together, I get what?",00:49:00.720,00:49:02.900
"Take the square root, I still
get 1, so this distance is 1.",00:49:02.900,00:49:06.870
Interesting.,00:49:06.870,00:49:08.270
"And then I got the negative
of that, which is over here,",00:49:08.270,00:49:11.070
and a negative of that.,00:49:11.070,00:49:12.670
"Then this is the-- with a
negative-- did I get it wrong?",00:49:12.670,00:49:17.095
"Yep, sorry.",00:49:17.095,00:49:18.870
"It doesn't matter, but I'll
think of it as i minus-- killed",00:49:18.870,00:49:25.082
a chalk-- i minus 1.,00:49:25.082,00:49:30.201
"It's the same because I
have the plus and minus,",00:49:30.201,00:49:32.200
but I like the geometry.,00:49:32.200,00:49:34.150
"So this point is negative root
2 over 2 by root 2 over 2,",00:49:34.150,00:49:40.380
"and then there's the
negative over here.",00:49:40.380,00:49:43.724
"What property do
these points have?",00:49:43.724,00:49:45.415
I heard a word.,00:49:50.770,00:49:51.574
AUDIENCE: Unit circle?,00:49:51.574,00:49:52.490
ERIK DEMAINE: Unit circle.,00:49:52.490,00:49:53.573
Good.,00:49:57.690,00:49:58.650
Who said unit circle?,00:49:58.650,00:50:00.660
Nice.,00:50:00.660,00:50:02.160
"It's a unit circle, right?",00:50:02.160,00:50:03.890
"Clearly that deserves
a Frisbee end.",00:50:03.890,00:50:05.390
Unit circle.,00:50:09.970,00:50:11.200
Hm.,00:50:11.200,00:50:13.150
Circle.,00:50:13.150,00:50:14.980
It seem good.,00:50:14.980,00:50:17.020
"What's going on here
is I took this number.",00:50:17.020,00:50:24.100
"I claimed it was
the square root of i",00:50:24.100,00:50:28.000
"because it turns out, if you
take points on the unit circle",00:50:28.000,00:50:30.470
"in the complex plane,
when you square",00:50:30.470,00:50:32.360
"a number it's like doubling the
angle relative to the x-axis.",00:50:32.360,00:50:36.260
This is angle 0.,00:50:36.260,00:50:37.560
"This is angle-- what do
you call it-- 45 degrees.",00:50:37.560,00:50:40.900
This is angle 90 degrees.,00:50:40.900,00:50:42.550
"So when I square this
number I get 90 degrees.",00:50:42.550,00:50:45.360
"That's why this number
is a square root of i.",00:50:45.360,00:50:49.774
"I probably should have
labeled some of these.",00:50:49.774,00:50:51.648
This is i.,00:50:51.648,00:50:53.022
This is minus i.,00:50:53.022,00:50:54.770
"This is minus 1, and this is 1.",00:50:54.770,00:51:00.320
"In general, we get something
called-- so these are",00:51:00.320,00:51:12.520
called the n-th roots of unity.,00:51:12.520,00:51:15.040
"Unity is just a
fancy word for 1.",00:51:19.040,00:51:23.330
"1 is here, and first we
computed the square roots of 1.",00:51:23.330,00:51:27.380
They were minus 1 and 1.,00:51:27.380,00:51:28.920
"Then we computed the
fourth roots of 1.",00:51:28.920,00:51:32.280
"All of these numbers, if
you take the fourth power,",00:51:32.280,00:51:37.910
you get 1.,00:51:37.910,00:51:39.590
"Then we computed the
eighth roots of 1.",00:51:39.590,00:51:41.970
"All of these numbers, if
you take the 8th power,",00:51:41.970,00:51:45.160
you get 1 again.,00:51:45.160,00:51:46.140
"So, in general,
n-th roots of unity.",00:51:46.140,00:51:49.074
"We're going to assume
n is a power of 2,",00:51:49.074,00:51:50.740
"but this notion actually
makes sense for any n.",00:51:50.740,00:51:53.730
"And they're just uniformly
spaced around the circle,",00:51:53.730,00:51:56.000
"and if you know some geometry
and how it relates to trig,",00:51:56.000,00:51:59.640
"you know that a general
point on the circle",00:51:59.640,00:52:01.820
is cos theta comma sine theta.,00:52:01.820,00:52:04.610
x-coordinate is cos theta.,00:52:04.610,00:52:06.480
y-coordinate is sine theta.,00:52:06.480,00:52:07.650
"This is also a funny notation
for complex numbers--",00:52:07.650,00:52:09.990
"not so funny, this is the
geometric interpretation",00:52:09.990,00:52:13.020
of cos theta plus i sine theta.,00:52:13.020,00:52:21.510
"And if I want them uniformly
spaced around the circle,",00:52:21.510,00:52:23.810
"and I want to include
this point-- also known",00:52:23.810,00:52:27.060
"as theta equals 0-- because
when theta equals 0,",00:52:27.060,00:52:30.510
"cos theta is 1, sine theta 0.",00:52:30.510,00:52:32.425
"So I want to say 4
theta equals to 0,",00:52:35.070,00:52:40.380
"and then-- here I'm going
to get fancy-- tau over n",00:52:40.380,00:52:46.630
"to tau over n up to n
minus 1 over n times tau.",00:52:46.630,00:52:54.280
What's tau?,00:52:54.280,00:52:55.637
AUDIENCE: 2pi.,00:52:55.637,00:52:56.220
"ERIK DEMAINE: 2pi, thank you.",00:52:56.220,00:52:57.720
"This is modern notation just
over the last couple years.",00:53:00.590,00:53:04.390
"I believe in tau so much I
got it tattooed on my arm.",00:53:04.390,00:53:09.790
Tau is the fundamental constant.,00:53:09.790,00:53:12.260
Screw pi.,00:53:12.260,00:53:14.310
None of that 3 and change.,00:53:14.310,00:53:16.000
Six and change is where it's at.,00:53:16.000,00:53:19.460
So tau.,00:53:19.460,00:53:21.196
Clearly this is much nicer.,00:53:21.196,00:53:22.320
"Tau over n, not 2pi over n.",00:53:22.320,00:53:24.840
Tau is a whole circle.,00:53:24.840,00:53:28.870
"This is one n-th of a circle,
2n-ths of a circle, n minus 1",00:53:28.870,00:53:32.062
over n-ths of a circle.,00:53:32.062,00:53:33.020
"I didn't do n n-ths of a
circle because that's also",00:53:33.020,00:53:35.340
the same as 0.,00:53:35.340,00:53:36.240
"Now, why did I
introduce this notation?",00:53:39.020,00:53:47.290
"Because there's this
other great thing",00:53:47.290,00:53:49.540
"called Euler's formula,
which is that this",00:53:49.540,00:53:55.460
equals e to the i theta.,00:53:55.460,00:54:02.810
Double check.,00:54:07.130,00:54:09.380
"It's so rare that I get
to do real calculus.",00:54:09.380,00:54:14.050
"This is Euler's
formula-- e for Euler--",00:54:14.050,00:54:16.460
another number-- 2 and change.,00:54:16.460,00:54:18.840
"e to the i-- this is funny
because it's complex-- times",00:54:18.840,00:54:21.810
"theta is equal to cos
theta plus i sine theta.",00:54:21.810,00:54:24.780
"This is the relation between
exponentials and trigonometry.",00:54:24.780,00:54:28.980
That's a big thing Euler did.,00:54:28.980,00:54:31.670
Cool.,00:54:31.670,00:54:33.080
So what?,00:54:33.080,00:54:33.660
"Because this lets
us understand how",00:54:33.660,00:54:36.080
"squares work-- not squares the
shape, squares the operation.",00:54:36.080,00:54:42.640
"When I take squares-- so
if I take e to the i theta,",00:54:50.580,00:54:57.060
"this is one of my
roots of unity.",00:54:57.060,00:55:00.020
Let me expand out what theta is.,00:55:00.020,00:55:02.380
"So theta is some k
times tau over n.",00:55:02.380,00:55:07.460
Let's do it this way first.,00:55:07.460,00:55:09.010
"So in reality we have k tau
over n, but when I square it,",00:55:09.010,00:55:17.070
"that's the same thing as
putting the 2 right here.",00:55:17.070,00:55:19.790
"This is the same thing
as e to i times 2 theta.",00:55:19.790,00:55:24.390
Bingo.,00:55:24.390,00:55:24.890
"I get what I was claiming, that
if I start at some angle theta",00:55:24.890,00:55:28.200
"relative to the x-axis,
when I square the number",00:55:28.200,00:55:31.450
I just double the angle.,00:55:31.450,00:55:32.950
This is why.,00:55:32.950,00:55:35.370
"This is obvious just
from regular algebra.",00:55:35.370,00:55:39.770
"And then this thing,
Euler's formula,",00:55:39.770,00:55:41.820
"tells me that corresponds to
doubling the angle on a circle.",00:55:41.820,00:55:45.680
"So it only works with
points on a circle.",00:55:45.680,00:55:47.970
"So when I go here I get e to
the i2k times tau over n--",00:55:47.970,00:55:58.610
twice as far around circle.,00:55:58.610,00:56:02.080
All right.,00:56:02.080,00:56:03.850
Fine.,00:56:03.850,00:56:06.530
"What happens if I take this
number and I square it?",00:56:06.530,00:56:10.520
This has a really big angle.,00:56:10.520,00:56:12.030
"This is 1/2 plus 1/8, whatever
that is-- 5/8 times tau.",00:56:12.030,00:56:20.500
"When I double that
angle I go to here.",00:56:20.500,00:56:28.230
"Now, this, you might
call it, 10/8, or you",00:56:28.230,00:56:31.910
"might also call it 1/4 because
when you go around the circle",00:56:31.910,00:56:36.540
you stay on the circle.,00:56:36.540,00:56:37.684
"So there's another
thing going on,",00:56:37.684,00:56:39.100
"which is really-- this is e to
the i times 2 theta mod tau.",00:56:39.100,00:56:47.580
"Usually we think of mods
relative to integers,",00:56:47.580,00:56:49.720
"but what I mean is every time
I add a multiple of tau nothing",00:56:49.720,00:56:54.040
changes.,00:56:54.040,00:56:54.540
"If I go around the circle five
times and then do something,",00:56:54.540,00:56:56.998
"it's the same as just
doing the something.",00:56:56.998,00:56:59.290
So I kind of need that.,00:56:59.290,00:57:01.620
"And this is true because
e to the i tau equals 1.",00:57:01.620,00:57:08.340
"You may know it as e to
the i pi equals negative 1,",00:57:08.340,00:57:12.500
"but clearly this is a superior
formula-- so superior I got",00:57:12.500,00:57:15.990
it tattooed on my other arm.,00:57:15.990,00:57:17.220
[LAUGHTER],00:57:17.220,00:57:20.549
"It's amazing what you can
do with a laser printer",00:57:20.549,00:57:22.590
and a temporary tattoo kit.,00:57:22.590,00:57:24.260
"Sadly, these won't last, but
definitely try it at home.",00:57:24.260,00:57:31.440
Cool.,00:57:31.440,00:57:32.090
"So e to the i tau equals
1, so going around",00:57:32.090,00:57:36.390
in circles-- same thing as not.,00:57:36.390,00:57:38.550
All right.,00:57:38.550,00:57:39.860
"So you can draw on this
picture for every number, what",00:57:39.860,00:57:42.580
is its square?,00:57:42.580,00:57:44.440
"And, in general, if you
look at these four guys,",00:57:44.440,00:57:47.957
"their squares are just
going to be these two guys.",00:57:47.957,00:57:50.040
"If you look at these
four guys, their squares",00:57:50.040,00:57:52.510
"are going to be among
these four guys.",00:57:52.510,00:57:55.000
So I started with 8 guys.,00:57:55.000,00:57:56.440
"I square them, I get 4.",00:57:56.440,00:57:57.530
"I square them, I get 2.",00:57:57.530,00:57:58.500
"I square them, I get 1.",00:57:58.500,00:57:59.510
"That's how we
constructed it, but you",00:57:59.510,00:58:01.640
"can see it works not
only for this 8-point set",00:58:01.640,00:58:05.100
"that we constructed
sort of by hand,",00:58:05.100,00:58:07.800
"but it works for the
n-th roots of unity.",00:58:07.800,00:58:09.770
"As long as n is a power
of 2 this set of points",00:58:09.770,00:58:14.260
will be collapsing.,00:58:14.260,00:58:15.055
"So if n is the power of
2 for some integer k,",00:58:17.690,00:58:23.240
"then n-th roots of
unity are collapsing",00:58:23.240,00:58:42.210
according to this definition.,00:58:42.210,00:58:44.700
And that's what we want.,00:58:44.700,00:58:46.480
"Then this divide and conquer
algorithm runs in n log n time",00:58:46.480,00:58:50.140
"because every time
we square the set x,",00:58:50.140,00:58:53.000
"we reduce its size
by a factor of 2.",00:58:53.000,00:58:55.510
"We get t of n equals 2
times t of n over 2 plus n.",00:58:55.510,00:58:58.990
"Plus order n and
that's order n log n.",00:58:58.990,00:59:01.190
"And so this whole thing we
compute-- in other words,",00:59:01.190,00:59:05.000
"we set xk to be e to
the ik tau over n.",00:59:05.000,00:59:13.280
"Now, I guess I should
say how to compute that,",00:59:13.280,00:59:15.780
"but let's just say that's
given to you for free.",00:59:15.780,00:59:18.500
"It takes constant time to
compute each roots of unity.",00:59:18.500,00:59:21.586
"In fact, again, we
only need to do this",00:59:21.586,00:59:23.210
"once and for all
for each value of n,",00:59:23.210,00:59:27.000
"so you can think of it as just
being part of the algorithm.",00:59:27.000,00:59:29.680
These are the xk's we use.,00:59:29.680,00:59:30.990
"I said xk could be anything
we want as long as they're all",00:59:30.990,00:59:33.550
"different, so I'm
going to choose them",00:59:33.550,00:59:35.290
"to be n uniformly spaced points
around the complex unit circle.",00:59:35.290,00:59:41.830
"And then magically this
algorithm runs in n log n time.",00:59:41.830,00:59:46.610
It's pretty cool.,00:59:46.610,00:59:49.109
"Intuitively, you think of
real numbers x squared,",00:59:49.109,00:59:51.150
"of course it has
the same sides as x.",00:59:51.150,00:59:54.360
"But once you go
to complex numbers",00:59:54.360,00:59:56.580
"there's this nifty
trick where you",00:59:56.580,00:59:58.420
"start with one
n-th of the circle",00:59:58.420,01:00:00.920
"and you'd uniformly space
points after the first level",01:00:00.920,01:00:03.345
of recursion.,01:00:03.345,01:00:03.920
"You only have to be
dealing with n over two",01:00:03.920,01:00:06.000
"of those points,
namely the even ones,",01:00:06.000,01:00:08.580
"also known as the n over
[? 2th ?] roots of unity.",01:00:08.580,01:00:11.179
"And after the next
level of recursion",01:00:11.179,01:00:12.720
"is the n over fourth
roots of unity.",01:00:12.720,01:00:14.220
And so on.,01:00:14.220,01:00:14.870
"So this recursion
is well defined.",01:00:14.870,01:00:16.930
"When you have a vector
of size n you just",01:00:16.930,01:00:19.030
"have to deal with the n-th roots
of unity, and you're happy.",01:00:19.030,01:00:21.670
That is fast Fourier transform.,01:00:25.710,01:00:28.090
"That algorithm with
these xi's is FFT.",01:00:28.090,01:00:33.750
So let me write this somewhere.,01:00:33.750,01:00:35.230
It kind of snuck up on us.,01:00:44.590,01:00:46.040
"This is the algorithm
we were aiming to find.",01:00:46.040,01:00:50.690
"Fast Fourier transform is that
divide and conquer algorithm",01:00:50.690,01:01:05.549
on the right.,01:01:05.549,01:01:06.090
I'll write it abstractly.,01:01:12.570,01:01:14.860
"For something called the
DFT-- the discrete Fourier",01:01:14.860,01:01:18.080
"transform-- is the corresponding
mathematical transformation.",01:01:18.080,01:01:29.570
The fast is about an algorithm.,01:01:29.570,01:01:31.310
Discrete is about discrete.,01:01:31.310,01:01:34.840
"So DFT is this thing that
we wanted to compute,",01:01:34.840,01:01:40.040
"which was basically
the product v times a.",01:01:40.040,01:01:45.660
"Remember, v was the
Vandermonde matrix,",01:01:45.660,01:01:48.310
"and it depended
on all these xk's.",01:01:48.310,01:01:52.430
"And we're going to set xk to
be this e to the ik tau over n.",01:01:52.430,01:02:00.240
"So if you remember the vjk
here was xj to the k-th power,",01:02:03.400,01:02:14.810
"so this just becomes e
to the ijk tau over n.",01:02:14.810,01:02:23.650
"It's a little funny
these are all consecutive",01:02:23.650,01:02:26.120
"because this is a
totally different,",01:02:26.120,01:02:27.640
but-- that's the matrix.,01:02:27.640,01:02:31.620
"If you take that
matrix times a vector,",01:02:31.620,01:02:35.044
"that is called a discrete
Fourier transform",01:02:35.044,01:02:36.835
"of the vector, and FFT is a way
to compute it in n log n time.",01:02:36.835,01:02:41.780
"You just run this algorithm
and for those xk's it'll",01:02:41.780,01:02:44.680
just work in n log n time.,01:02:44.680,01:02:46.104
Cool.,01:02:48.880,01:02:50.480
"But if you remember way back to
the beginning, what we needed",01:02:50.480,01:02:53.560
"is a way-- this converts
a coefficient vector",01:02:53.560,01:02:56.300
into a sample vector.,01:02:56.300,01:02:58.390
"Then we can multiply
the polynomials,",01:02:58.390,01:03:04.890
"then we need to transform the
sample vector that results back",01:03:04.890,01:03:08.150
into a coefficient vector.,01:03:08.150,01:03:09.820
So we're only half done.,01:03:09.820,01:03:11.750
I only have 15 minutes.,01:03:11.750,01:03:13.840
"Luckily, the other half is
almost identical to this half,",01:03:13.840,01:03:17.040
so let's do that next.,01:03:17.040,01:03:19.420
Maybe over here.,01:03:19.420,01:03:20.390
"So we've got our great
divide and conquer algorithm,",01:03:28.160,01:03:31.130
"what we need now--
let me give you",01:03:31.130,01:03:33.290
"the polynomial
multiplication algorithm.",01:03:33.290,01:03:35.630
"Let's call this-- sound more
exotic-- fast polynomial",01:03:38.520,01:03:42.660
"multiplication, fast
meaning n log n.",01:03:42.660,01:03:45.565
"Let's say that we're
given two polynomials, a",01:03:48.830,01:03:53.400
"and b, represented
in coefficient form.",01:03:53.400,01:03:56.460
"What we need is-- I'll
call it a star, which is",01:04:00.770,01:04:06.280
the result of running FFT on a.,01:04:06.280,01:04:10.230
"It's the discrete Fourier
transform of a. b star,",01:04:10.230,01:04:15.320
do the same thing.,01:04:15.320,01:04:17.430
"So we know what this
means is convert",01:04:17.430,01:04:20.250
"a from a coefficient vector
into a sample vector.",01:04:20.250,01:04:23.040
"Convert b from a coefficient
vector into a sample vector.",01:04:23.040,01:04:25.970
"Now I have the samples of a star
at the n-th roots of unity--",01:04:25.970,01:04:31.880
"these guys-- and
I have the samples",01:04:31.880,01:04:36.400
"of b at the exact same points--
the n-th roots of unity--",01:04:36.400,01:04:40.250
"so I can compute c star, the
transform version-- the DFT",01:04:40.250,01:04:45.900
"of c-- is just the,
I mean, c star k",01:04:45.900,01:04:51.920
equals a star k times b star k.,01:04:51.920,01:04:55.900
"This is the multiplication
algorithm for sample vectors.",01:04:55.900,01:05:01.160
We started with that.,01:05:01.160,01:05:02.440
That's linear time.,01:05:02.440,01:05:03.990
"And then the missing
piece is I need",01:05:03.990,01:05:06.420
"to re-compute c, which is
the inverse fast Fourier",01:05:06.420,01:05:10.640
transform of c star.,01:05:10.640,01:05:14.005
"So this is the missing
link, so to speak.",01:05:17.940,01:05:21.030
"We need to be able
to go backwards",01:05:21.030,01:05:22.477
in this transformation.,01:05:22.477,01:05:23.435
"Good news is the algorithm
is not going to change.",01:05:32.910,01:05:36.630
"What we're computing
isn't going to change.",01:05:36.630,01:05:40.104
"All that's going to
change are the xk's.",01:05:40.104,01:05:41.770
Why?,01:05:45.230,01:05:46.740
"Because, remember
from the top-- right",01:05:46.740,01:05:51.210
"now we know how to compute
v times a, but what we now",01:05:51.210,01:05:53.940
"need to compute is
the inverse times a.",01:05:53.940,01:05:57.230
"So the only question
is, what is the inverse?",01:05:57.230,01:06:00.470
"This matrix has a super special
structure-- it's symmetric,",01:06:00.470,01:06:05.660
"lots of points on a
circle-- maybe the inverse",01:06:05.660,01:06:08.340
has a nice structure.,01:06:08.340,01:06:10.560
And it does.,01:06:10.560,01:06:13.070
"Claim is the inverse is v
complex conjugate divided by n.",01:06:13.070,01:06:25.220
What's complex conjugate?,01:06:25.220,01:06:27.340
"For a geometer, it's
reflection through the x-axis.",01:06:27.340,01:06:30.220
"For an algebraic
person, a plus ib,",01:06:30.220,01:06:35.130
"the complex conjugate
is a minus ib.",01:06:35.130,01:06:40.000
"So just apply that to
every entry in the matrix,",01:06:40.000,01:06:43.560
"and then divide all
the entries by n.",01:06:43.560,01:06:45.647
You get the inverse.,01:06:45.647,01:06:46.480
Cool.,01:06:50.130,01:06:51.490
"Very cool because what
this tells us is we",01:06:51.490,01:06:55.610
"run exactly the same
algorithm and do exactly",01:06:55.610,01:06:58.850
the same transformation.,01:06:58.850,01:07:01.320
"If we want to do the
inverse we can actually",01:07:01.320,01:07:04.410
"just use v, but with a
different choice of xk.",01:07:04.410,01:07:08.310
"Namely, for the inverse,
we'll call it xk inverse.",01:07:08.310,01:07:13.315
"We just take the
complex conjugate",01:07:16.280,01:07:19.230
"of this thing, which
turns out to be",01:07:19.230,01:07:24.040
"e to the minus ijk
tau over n, and then",01:07:24.040,01:07:32.534
divide the whole thing by n.,01:07:32.534,01:07:33.700
"I'm using a fact here, which
is that the complex conjugate",01:07:36.610,01:07:39.550
"of this number is
actually, just,",01:07:39.550,01:07:42.990
you put a minus sign here.,01:07:42.990,01:07:45.090
Why does that hold?,01:07:45.090,01:07:45.940
Because geometry.,01:07:45.940,01:07:46.815
"Theta is usually measuring
the counterclockwise angle",01:07:49.350,01:07:53.040
from the x-axis.,01:07:53.040,01:07:54.990
"If you take the complex
conjugate you go from up here",01:07:54.990,01:07:57.890
"to down here-- the
reflection to the x-axis.",01:07:57.890,01:08:00.395
"That's the same thing
as if you measure theta",01:08:00.395,01:08:02.270
"as a clockwise angle
from the x-axis.",01:08:02.270,01:08:05.380
"That's the same thing
as negating the angle.",01:08:05.380,01:08:07.790
"So that's just a
little geometry.",01:08:07.790,01:08:09.361
"You can prove it
algebraically, although I",01:08:09.361,01:08:11.110
don't know how off-hand.,01:08:11.110,01:08:13.850
It's not hard.,01:08:13.850,01:08:15.830
"So if I want to take
some angle and then",01:08:15.830,01:08:18.370
"flip it through the x-axis,
it's the same as the negative",01:08:18.370,01:08:21.189
of the angle.,01:08:21.189,01:08:21.750
"So the complex
conjugate of this number",01:08:21.750,01:08:24.439
"is the same thing
with a minus sign.",01:08:24.439,01:08:26.997
And then we have to divide by n.,01:08:26.997,01:08:28.330
If I just-- did I lie?,01:08:28.330,01:08:31.570
"I can't divide by n, sorry.",01:08:34.979,01:08:37.279
It's in the wrong spot.,01:08:37.279,01:08:38.640
"I use these xk's and then
I apply the transform.",01:08:38.640,01:08:43.670
I take this thing.,01:08:43.670,01:08:45.670
"I get not quite the inverse, but
I end up getting n the inverse.",01:08:45.670,01:08:49.939
I multiply that by my a star.,01:08:49.939,01:08:53.649
"That's going to
give me n times n.",01:08:53.649,01:08:55.702
"So then I just take that
vector and divided by n.",01:09:02.000,01:09:05.289
"Boom, I've got the
inverse transform.",01:09:05.289,01:09:06.830
"So this is how you do inverse
fast Fourier transform.",01:09:06.830,01:09:13.200
"You just flip the sign and
the exponent in the xk's,",01:09:13.200,01:09:17.000
"then you do the same
matrix-vector product,",01:09:17.000,01:09:20.270
and then you divide by n.,01:09:20.270,01:09:21.495
"And then you've
done the inverse.",01:09:21.495,01:09:22.870
"So that's how you do-- if you
believe this claim-- that's",01:09:22.870,01:09:25.757
how you do this last step.,01:09:25.757,01:09:26.840
Question?,01:09:26.840,01:09:27.340

Just k.,01:09:37.180,01:09:38.680
Thank you.,01:09:38.680,01:09:40.700
Other questions?,01:09:40.700,01:09:43.720
"So what remains is
to prove this claim.",01:09:43.720,01:09:48.390
"I'd be very happy if I-- I
should probably have better--",01:09:48.390,01:09:54.420
"anyway, that's not the best.",01:09:54.420,01:09:57.570
I'm going to call this xk prime.,01:09:57.570,01:10:01.600
"Then when I plug that in, I get
a different matrix, v prime.",01:10:01.600,01:10:06.850
"And what this claim
says is that v prime is",01:10:06.850,01:10:12.040
equal to n times the inverse.,01:10:12.040,01:10:16.330
"So I apply the same
f of t algorithm,",01:10:16.330,01:10:18.810
"but with v prime
instead of v, then I",01:10:18.810,01:10:21.510
"get not quite the
product I want,",01:10:21.510,01:10:23.390
"but just n times
the product I want.",01:10:23.390,01:10:25.230
"Divide every term by n
and we get the inverse.",01:10:25.230,01:10:29.165
"This is the cool thing
about complex numbers.",01:10:29.165,01:10:31.040
Here we get another cool thing.,01:10:31.040,01:10:33.580
"All right, but we have
to prove this claim.",01:10:33.580,01:10:36.120
"So let's do a little
bit of algebra.",01:10:36.120,01:10:38.420
"No pain, no gain.",01:10:38.420,01:10:39.240
Good.,01:10:41.851,01:10:42.350
So let's look at vjk prime.,01:10:45.460,01:10:49.885
Sorry.,01:10:55.240,01:10:55.740
"So let's look at p,
the product of v,",01:11:04.690,01:11:12.460
"and v complex conjugate-- what
I was calling v prime up there.",01:11:12.460,01:11:18.550
"I claim that this thing
is n times the identity",01:11:18.550,01:11:22.500
"matrix, with 1's
down the diagonal",01:11:22.500,01:11:24.355
and 0's everywhere else.,01:11:24.355,01:11:26.860
So let's look at this product.,01:11:26.860,01:11:28.990

the jk-th item in the product.",01:11:28.990,01:11:35.370
"That's going to come from row
j of V, dot product with column",01:11:35.370,01:11:43.670
k of the complex conjugate.,01:11:43.670,01:11:47.620
"Now the matrices
here are symmetric,",01:11:47.620,01:11:49.120
"so actually rows and
columns are the same,",01:11:49.120,01:11:50.890
"but that's the general
definition of the cell",01:11:50.890,01:11:53.267
and the product of two matrices.,01:11:53.267,01:11:54.600
"So let's write it
out and a summation.",01:11:57.330,01:12:01.170
"We have-- from m equals
0-- it's so hard not",01:12:01.170,01:12:05.560
to use i for my summations.,01:12:05.560,01:12:07.450
"It's the only class I have to do
it because i is already taken,",01:12:07.450,01:12:10.270
"but I guess I can
still use capital I,",01:12:10.270,01:12:12.040
"but we'll use m because i
is complex number today.",01:12:12.040,01:12:18.120
"So we have e to the i
tau jm over n times e",01:12:18.120,01:12:30.570
to the minus i tau mk k over n.,01:12:30.570,01:12:36.010
"I don't know why I
changed the order.",01:12:36.010,01:12:37.924
"I put the tau here instead
of there, but same thing.",01:12:37.924,01:12:40.090
"This is just the
for every position",01:12:42.720,01:12:46.040
"m in the cell and
corresponding position",01:12:46.040,01:12:47.980
"m in-- sorry, m in the
row, corresponding position",01:12:47.980,01:12:51.020
"m in the column, I have
jm and I have mk-- again,",01:12:51.020,01:12:55.929
the order doesn't matter.,01:12:55.929,01:12:56.970
"It's symmetric, but I'm
getting it right here.",01:12:56.970,01:12:59.600
"This is-- we're
using this formula.",01:12:59.600,01:13:03.520
"I put a minus sign here because
this is the complex conjugate.",01:13:03.520,01:13:09.600
So now I just do some algebra.,01:13:09.600,01:13:11.440
These share a lot.,01:13:11.440,01:13:12.230
They share i.,01:13:12.230,01:13:13.520
"They share m, and they
share the divided by n.",01:13:13.520,01:13:20.500
"So this is sum m equals 0,
n minus 1 e to the i-- oh,",01:13:20.500,01:13:28.910
"they also share tau-- tau
m over n times j minus k.",01:13:28.910,01:13:40.060
"Please correct me if
I make any mistakes.",01:13:40.060,01:13:43.450
Cool.,01:13:43.450,01:13:43.950
"So it depends how and
k relate, of course.",01:13:43.950,01:13:48.660
"If j equals k, that's also known
as something on the diagonal.",01:13:48.660,01:13:54.410
"I want the matrix
n, n, n, n, 0, 0.",01:13:54.410,01:13:59.090
So j equals k.,01:13:59.090,01:14:00.590
That's the diagonal.,01:14:00.590,01:14:01.510
"That's where I want to get n,
and, indeed, if j equals k,",01:14:01.510,01:14:04.240
this becomes 0.,01:14:04.240,01:14:05.320
"So all this becomes
0. e to the 0 is 1,",01:14:05.320,01:14:09.410
and so I'm summing up 1 n times.,01:14:09.410,01:14:11.920
I get n.,01:14:11.920,01:14:14.260
Cool.,01:14:14.260,01:14:15.060
That's one case.,01:14:15.060,01:14:15.810
"This is n if j equals k, and
somehow I claim that everywhere",01:14:15.810,01:14:21.110
else I get 0's.,01:14:21.110,01:14:23.300
So let's prove that.,01:14:23.300,01:14:24.750
"So if j does not
equal k-- I'm going",01:14:43.810,01:14:51.030
to rewrite this a little bit.,01:14:51.030,01:14:54.070
j and k are fixed.,01:14:54.070,01:14:57.010
"m is changing in the sum,
so I want to write this",01:14:57.010,01:15:01.500
"as sum m equals 0 to n minus
1, e to the i tau j minus k,",01:15:01.500,01:15:17.880
"over m, times m.",01:15:17.880,01:15:22.510
"In other words, this thing
raised to the n-th power.",01:15:22.510,01:15:27.430
What is this series?,01:15:27.430,01:15:28.569
One word.,01:15:33.460,01:15:34.836
AUDIENCE: Geometric.,01:15:34.836,01:15:35.760
ERIK DEMAINE: Geometric.,01:15:35.760,01:15:36.760
Thank you.,01:15:36.760,01:15:37.435
"This is a geometric
series, and I",01:15:41.100,01:15:44.820
"guess I should have waited to
give you the Frisbee until you",01:15:44.820,01:15:48.010
"tell me how do you
solve a geometric series",01:15:48.010,01:15:50.380
with a finite term?,01:15:50.380,01:15:51.660
So think of this as z to the m.,01:15:51.660,01:15:55.050
Do you know the formula?,01:15:55.050,01:15:56.080
"AUDIENCE: That's
the e to the i tau--",01:15:56.080,01:15:59.315
ERIK DEMAINE: Just z.,01:15:59.315,01:16:00.190
"ERIK DEMAINE: Oh,
z to the n minus 1.",01:16:00.190,01:16:03.295
"ERIK DEMAINE: Z
to the n minus 1.",01:16:03.295,01:16:04.670
Almost.,01:16:04.670,01:16:05.290
AUDIENCE: Over z minus 1.,01:16:05.290,01:16:06.332
ERIK DEMAINE: Over z minus 1.,01:16:06.332,01:16:07.540
Yep.,01:16:07.540,01:16:08.250
"That's-- If you have sum of z to
the k, k equals 0 to n minus 1.",01:16:08.250,01:16:14.210
That's that.,01:16:14.210,01:16:14.830
"It's in the appendix
of your textbook.",01:16:14.830,01:16:17.290
"So we just plug
that in and we get--",01:16:17.290,01:16:21.340
"oh boy-- e to the-- better
chalk-- e to the i tau",01:16:21.340,01:16:29.380
"j minus k over n to the n-th
power minus 1 over e to the i.",01:16:29.380,01:16:39.224
"Actually, the denominator
doesn't really",01:16:39.224,01:16:40.890
"matter because this
is supposed to be 0,",01:16:40.890,01:16:43.660
"so it's all about the numerator,
but it's the same thing.",01:16:43.660,01:16:48.360
Minus 1.,01:16:48.360,01:16:49.130
Where's my red?,01:16:53.130,01:16:54.306
Red.,01:16:54.306,01:16:56.590
The n cancels with the n.,01:16:56.590,01:17:00.280
"This is an integer not equal to
zero, so we have e to the i tau",01:17:00.280,01:17:07.090
to an integer power.,01:17:07.090,01:17:09.020
What's e to the i tau?,01:17:09.020,01:17:12.270
1.,01:17:12.270,01:17:12.770
"Convenient that I
have that there.",01:17:15.430,01:17:17.170
"1 minus 1 is 0, so we get 0.",01:17:17.170,01:17:21.011
Satisfying.,01:17:21.011,01:17:21.510
So that proves this claim.,01:17:24.670,01:17:26.700
"We prove that, on the
diagonal, we get n",01:17:26.700,01:17:28.780
because we had n copies of 1.,01:17:28.780,01:17:30.370
"Off the diagonal we
get 0, like this.",01:17:30.370,01:17:34.110
"Therefore, v complex conjugate
times n is the v inverse.",01:17:34.110,01:17:40.530
"Therefore, this
algorithm actually",01:17:40.530,01:17:42.320
"computes the inverse
fast Fourier transform.",01:17:42.320,01:17:46.520
"So that's it for
algorithms today,",01:17:46.520,01:17:49.460
"but let me quickly tell you
about some applications.",01:17:49.460,01:17:52.730
"You've probably
taken other classes",01:17:52.730,01:17:54.560
"that use applications of
fast Fourier transform,",01:17:54.560,01:17:56.560
so I will just summarize.,01:17:56.560,01:17:58.510
"If you've ever edited
audio, you probably",01:17:58.510,01:18:02.380
"did it in-- unless you're just
pasting audio clips together--",01:18:02.380,01:18:08.490
"you probably did it in what's
called frequency space.",01:18:08.490,01:18:11.160
"So you know that-- as I talked
about in the beginning--",01:18:11.160,01:18:13.910
"when we're measuring where the
membrane on this microphone",01:18:13.910,01:18:16.480
"goes over time, that is in
the time domain for every time",01:18:16.480,01:18:21.550
"we sample where,
physically, this thing is.",01:18:21.550,01:18:23.850
"If you apply-- I think
the way I defined it here",01:18:23.850,01:18:26.277
"is the inverse fast
Fourier transform,",01:18:26.277,01:18:27.860
"usually it's called Fourier
transform-- to that time domain",01:18:27.860,01:18:32.430
"vector, you get a new vector.",01:18:32.430,01:18:34.950
Now it's a complex vector.,01:18:34.950,01:18:36.826
"You may have started
with real numbers.",01:18:36.826,01:18:38.450
You get complex numbers.,01:18:38.450,01:18:40.000
"So for every position
in the vector--",01:18:40.000,01:18:43.850
"what it corresponds to-- the
x-axis is no longer time.",01:18:43.850,01:18:47.060
Now it's frequency.,01:18:47.060,01:18:48.360
"For every frequency
you're measuring,",01:18:48.360,01:18:51.390
"essentially, you're
viewing this vector--",01:18:51.390,01:18:53.510
"the waveform-- as a bunch
of trigonometric functions--",01:18:53.510,01:18:57.130
"say, sine of
something times theta.",01:18:57.130,01:19:01.201
"If you look at one of the
entries in the vector,",01:19:01.201,01:19:03.200
"and it's a complex
number-- if you compute",01:19:03.200,01:19:04.810
"the magnitude of
the complex number--",01:19:04.810,01:19:06.351
"the length of the
vector, of the length",01:19:06.351,01:19:08.640
"of that two-coordinate vector--
that is how much stuff--",01:19:08.640,01:19:13.695
of that frequency-- you have.,01:19:13.695,01:19:15.900
"And then the angle
of the vector, in 2D,",01:19:15.900,01:19:18.630
"is how that trigonometric
function shifted in time.",01:19:18.630,01:19:23.670
"So if you take a pure note,
like if I was playing a bell",01:19:23.670,01:19:27.900
"and it's exactly C major,
it looks really wavy.",01:19:27.900,01:19:32.980
"It's actually a
nice perfect sine",01:19:32.980,01:19:35.780
"curve-- some offset
depending on when I hit it--",01:19:35.780,01:19:39.127
"and then if you apply the
Fourier transform what you get",01:19:39.127,01:19:41.460
"is 0's everywhere except for the
one frequency that's appearing,",01:19:41.460,01:19:44.790
"and there you get 1, and
everywhere else you get 0.",01:19:44.790,01:19:48.540
"Well, 1 possibly rotated,
depending on the phase.",01:19:48.540,01:19:52.650
"And you can take
any audio stream,",01:19:52.650,01:19:55.410
"convert it by a
Fourier transform,",01:19:55.410,01:19:57.292
do manipulations there.,01:19:57.292,01:19:58.250
"For example, you've probably
heard of high-pass filters that",01:19:58.250,01:20:01.095
"removes all the
high frequencies,",01:20:01.095,01:20:02.470
"or low-pass filters remove
all of the low frequencies.",01:20:02.470,01:20:04.400
"You just convert to
this space and zero out",01:20:04.400,01:20:06.225
"the parts you want, and
then you convert back",01:20:06.225,01:20:08.100
with inverse Fourier transform.,01:20:08.100,01:20:10.230
"If you've used Adobe
Audition or Audacity,",01:20:10.230,01:20:11.980
they can all do these things.,01:20:11.980,01:20:14.140
"And there are tons
of contexts where",01:20:14.140,01:20:15.720
"converting to Fourier
space makes life easy.",01:20:15.720,01:20:18.500
"And, in general, if you
have any time-based signal",01:20:18.500,01:20:20.790
"you should always think about
what do you get with FFT",01:20:20.790,01:20:23.220
"when you transform to
frequency-based signal,",01:20:23.220,01:20:26.714
"and you can do
lots of cool things",01:20:26.714,01:20:28.130
you couldn't do otherwise.,01:20:28.130,01:20:29.213
And it only takes n log n time.,01:20:29.213,01:20:30.790
Plus people do it in hardware.,01:20:30.790,01:20:32.360
"There's a fast
implementation called",01:20:32.360,01:20:33.860
"FFTW-- the fastest Fourier
transform in the west-- which",01:20:33.860,01:20:37.640
"is made here at MIT
a bunch of years ago,",01:20:37.640,01:20:40.360
"and is still the best software
implementation of FFT.",01:20:40.360,01:20:43.390
So people use it everywhere.,01:20:43.390,01:20:46.150
"Your noise-cancelling headsets
probably use it, MP3 uses it.",01:20:46.150,01:20:49.720
