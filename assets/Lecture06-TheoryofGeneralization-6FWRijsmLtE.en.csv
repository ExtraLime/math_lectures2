"ANNOUNCER: The following program
is brought to you by Caltech.",00:00:02.860,00:00:05.525
 ,00:00:05.525,00:00:18.210
YASER ABU-MOSTAFA: Welcome back.,00:00:18.210,00:00:21.090
"Last time, we introduced some important
concepts in our theoretical",00:00:21.090,00:00:25.630
development.,00:00:25.630,00:00:27.550
And the first concept was dichotomies.,00:00:27.550,00:00:31.710
"And the idea is that there is an input
space behind this opaque sheet, and",00:00:31.710,00:00:36.250
"there is a hypothesis that's
separating red",00:00:36.250,00:00:38.480
regions from blue regions.,00:00:38.480,00:00:40.400
But we don't get to see that.,00:00:40.400,00:00:42.550
"What we get to see are just the
data points, holes in that",00:00:42.550,00:00:46.760
sheet if you will.,00:00:46.760,00:00:48.270
"And there could be very exciting stuff
happening behind that sheet, and all",00:00:48.270,00:00:52.140
"you get to see is when the boundary
crosses one of these points, and a blue",00:00:52.140,00:00:56.030
point turns red or vice-versa.,00:00:56.030,00:00:58.790
"So if you think of the purpose for the
dichotomies, we had a problem with",00:00:58.790,00:01:03.600
"counting the number of hypotheses,
because we end up with",00:01:03.600,00:01:06.250
a very large number.,00:01:06.250,00:01:07.770
"But if you restrict your attention to
dichotomies, which are the hypotheses",00:01:07.770,00:01:11.850
"restricted to a finite set of points,
the blue and red points here, then you",00:01:11.850,00:01:17.020
"don't have to count everything
that is happening outside.",00:01:17.020,00:01:19.640
"You only count it as different when
something different happens only on",00:01:19.640,00:01:22.980
those points.,00:01:22.980,00:01:24.090
"So a dichotomy is a mini-hypothesis,
if you will.",00:01:24.090,00:01:27.610
"And it counts the hypotheses only
on the finite set of points.",00:01:27.610,00:01:34.170
"This resulted in a definition that
parallels the number of hypotheses,",00:01:34.170,00:01:38.740
"which is the number of dichotomies
in this case.",00:01:38.740,00:01:41.730
So we define the growth function.,00:01:41.730,00:01:43.980
"The growth function is-- you pick
the points x_1 up to x_N.",00:01:43.980,00:01:48.230
"You pick them wisely, with a view to
maximizing the dichotomies, such that",00:01:48.230,00:01:52.180
"the number you get will be more than any
number another person gets with N",00:01:52.180,00:01:56.545
points. That's the purpose.,00:01:56.545,00:01:58.540
"So you take your hypothesis set, which
applies to the entire input",00:01:58.540,00:02:02.650
"space, and then apply it
only to x_1 up to x_N.",00:02:02.650,00:02:07.660
"This will result in a pattern of
+1 or -1's, N of them.",00:02:07.660,00:02:11.690
"And as you vary the hypothesis within
this set, you will get another",00:02:11.690,00:02:14.855
"pattern, another pattern,
another pattern.",00:02:14.855,00:02:17.060
"So you will get a set of different
patterns that are all the dichotomies",00:02:17.060,00:02:20.390
"that can be generated by this hypothesis
set, on this set of points.",00:02:20.390,00:02:24.910
"And the number of those guys is
what we are interested in.",00:02:24.910,00:02:27.520
"It will play the role of the
number of hypotheses.",00:02:27.520,00:02:30.600
And that is the growth function.,00:02:30.600,00:02:33.220
"Now in principle, the growth function
can be 2 to the N. You may be in",00:02:33.220,00:02:37.290
"an input space and a hypothesis set,
such that you can generate",00:02:37.290,00:02:40.690
any pattern you want.,00:02:40.690,00:02:42.410
"However, in most of the cases, the
restriction of using hypotheses coming",00:02:42.410,00:02:46.300
"from H will result in missing
out on some of the patterns.",00:02:46.300,00:02:50.150
"Some patterns will simply
be impossible.",00:02:50.150,00:02:52.580
"And that led us to the idea
of a break point.",00:02:52.580,00:02:55.390
"For the case of a perceptron in
two dimensions, which is the case we",00:02:55.390,00:02:58.770
"studied, we realize that for four
points, there will always be a pattern",00:02:58.770,00:03:03.030
"that cannot be realized
by a perceptron.",00:03:03.030,00:03:05.430
"There is no way to have a line come
here, and separate those red points",00:03:05.430,00:03:09.620
from the blue points.,00:03:09.620,00:03:10.810
"And any choice of four points will
also result in",00:03:10.810,00:03:14.930
missing patterns.,00:03:14.930,00:03:16.290
"Therefore, the number k equals 4, in this
case, is defined as a break point",00:03:16.290,00:03:21.110
for the perceptrons.,00:03:21.110,00:03:22.890
"And our theoretical goal is to take that
single number, which is the break",00:03:22.890,00:03:26.720
"point, and be able to characterize the
entire growth function for every N.",00:03:26.720,00:03:31.950
"And therefore, be able to characterize
the generalization, as we will see.",00:03:31.950,00:03:38.080
"We then talked about the maximum
number of dichotomies, under the",00:03:38.080,00:03:41.690
"constraint that there
is a break point.",00:03:41.690,00:03:43.210
"And we had an illustrative example to
tell you that, when you tell me that",00:03:43.210,00:03:46.950
you cannot get all patterns on any--,00:03:46.950,00:03:49.480
"in this case, two points--",00:03:49.480,00:03:51.680
"that is a very strong restriction on
the number of dichotomies you can",00:03:51.680,00:03:55.160
get on a larger number of points.,00:03:55.160,00:03:56.960
So this is the simplest case.,00:03:56.960,00:03:59.350
"If you take any two columns, you
cannot get all four patterns.",00:03:59.350,00:04:02.710
That's by decree.,00:04:02.710,00:04:03.840
"I'm telling you that the hypothesis
has a break point of 2.",00:04:03.840,00:04:07.000
"And then I'm asking you, under those
constraints, how many lines you can",00:04:07.000,00:04:10.180
"get, how many different
patterns you can get.",00:04:10.180,00:04:12.710
"And you go and you add them
up, and you end up in this",00:04:12.710,00:04:15.370
case with only four.,00:04:15.370,00:04:16.420
So you lost half of them.,00:04:16.420,00:04:17.779
"And you can see that if we have 10
points, and you apply the same",00:04:17.779,00:04:20.769
"restriction, there will be so many
lost, because now the restriction",00:04:20.769,00:04:23.820
applies to any pair of points.,00:04:23.820,00:04:26.500
"Now, if you look at this schedule,
this does not appeal to any",00:04:26.500,00:04:30.140
"particulars of the hypothesis set or the
input space, other than the fact",00:04:30.140,00:04:34.800
that the break point is 2.,00:04:34.800,00:04:36.950
"I could be in a situation, where the
hypothesis set cannot generate some of",00:04:36.950,00:04:40.990
these guys for other reasons.,00:04:40.990,00:04:42.990
"But here, I'm abstracting only
a hypothesis set and an input space.",00:04:42.990,00:04:46.800
"I don't want to bother to
know more about them.",00:04:46.800,00:04:48.990
"Just tell me that they have a break
point, and I'm trying to find under",00:04:48.990,00:04:52.240
"that single constraint, how many
can I possibly have?",00:04:52.240,00:04:56.110
"And I already have, by that
combinatorial constraint,",00:04:56.110,00:04:58.900
"a restriction which is strong enough
to get me a good-enough result.",00:04:58.900,00:05:02.330
"That's good, because now I don't have
to worry about every hypothesis",00:05:02.330,00:05:05.640
"set, and every input space, you give me.",00:05:05.640,00:05:07.450
"I just ask you:
what is the break point?",00:05:07.450,00:05:09.030
"And I'm able to make a statement about
the growth function not being bigger",00:05:09.030,00:05:12.400
than something.,00:05:12.400,00:05:13.120
That is the key.,00:05:13.120,00:05:15.250
"We move on to today's lecture, and
the title is, properly, the Theory of",00:05:15.250,00:05:19.900
Generalization.,00:05:19.900,00:05:20.760
It's very theoretical.,00:05:20.760,00:05:22.320
"And today's lecture is the most
theoretical of the entire course.",00:05:22.320,00:05:26.760
"So fasten your seat belts,
and let's start!",00:05:26.760,00:05:31.770
We have two items of business.,00:05:31.770,00:05:34.450
"The first one is to show that the growth
function, with a break point, is",00:05:34.450,00:05:38.240
indeed polynomial.,00:05:38.240,00:05:40.320
"The second one is to show that we can
actually take that notion, the growth",00:05:40.320,00:05:45.410
"function, and put it in place of
M, the number of hypotheses,",00:05:45.410,00:05:49.650
in Hoeffding's inequality.,00:05:49.650,00:05:52.580
"So basically, we are saying in the
first part: it's worthwhile to study",00:05:52.580,00:05:57.590
the growth function.,00:05:57.590,00:05:58.830
"Because being polynomial will
be very advantageous.",00:05:58.830,00:06:01.770
"And then, the second one is: we can
actually do something good with it.",00:06:01.770,00:06:05.780
We can do the replacement.,00:06:05.780,00:06:07.020
These are the only two items.,00:06:07.020,00:06:10.170
Let's start.,00:06:10.170,00:06:12.660
"We are going to bound the growth
function by a polynomial.",00:06:12.660,00:06:16.240
"And I just wanted to point some
of the aspects of that.",00:06:16.240,00:06:20.880
"If I say m_H of N is polynomial, it's not
that I am going to actually solve",00:06:20.880,00:06:25.360
"for the growth function, and show that
it is this particular polynomial, and",00:06:25.360,00:06:28.910
the coefficients.,00:06:28.910,00:06:29.780
"All I am saying is that it is really
just bounded above by a polynomial.",00:06:29.780,00:06:36.130
"I don't have to get the particulars
of m_H of N, the growth function.",00:06:36.130,00:06:40.330
"I am going to just tell you that this
is less than something, less than",00:06:40.330,00:06:42.530
"something, less than a polynomial.",00:06:42.530,00:06:43.830
"That's all I need, because eventually
I am going to put this in the",00:06:43.830,00:06:47.730
Hoeffding inequality.,00:06:47.730,00:06:48.980
"And as long as it's bounded by
a polynomial, I am in business.",00:06:48.980,00:06:51.890
"Because the negative exponential
will kill it, as we",00:06:51.890,00:06:53.920
"discussed, and we are OK.",00:06:53.920,00:06:55.560
"So we can be a bit loose, which
is very good in theory.",00:06:55.560,00:06:58.010
"Because now you leave a lot
of artifacts that you",00:06:58.010,00:07:01.690
don't need to study.,00:07:01.690,00:07:02.680
"And just talk about the upper bound in
the general case, and still get what",00:07:02.680,00:07:06.440
you want to get.,00:07:06.440,00:07:07.690
 ,00:07:07.690,00:07:09.610
"The key quantity we are going to use,
which is a purely combinatorial",00:07:09.610,00:07:12.820
"quantity, we are going to
call it B of N and k.",00:07:12.820,00:07:17.910
"This is exactly the quantity we
were seeking in the puzzle.",00:07:17.910,00:07:22.050
I give you N points.,00:07:22.050,00:07:23.970
"I tell you that k is a break point, and
ask you: how many different patterns",00:07:23.970,00:07:28.830
can you get under those conditions?,00:07:28.830,00:07:31.530
"In that case, we had three points
and the break point was 2.",00:07:31.530,00:07:35.800
"And we answered this question
by construction.",00:07:35.800,00:07:38.020
"We played around with the patterns until
we got it, and then we said it's 4.",00:07:38.020,00:07:42.090
"Now, as I develop the theory,
the puzzle will come up",00:07:42.090,00:07:45.700
in one of the results.,00:07:45.700,00:07:47.030
"I would like you to keep an eye and
say which slide, and which particular",00:07:47.030,00:07:51.960
"part of the slide, addresses the very
specific puzzle we talked about.",00:07:51.960,00:07:57.390
"The definition here is the maximum
number of dichotomies on N points,",00:07:57.390,00:08:03.010
such that they have a break point k.,00:08:03.010,00:08:05.400
So this is N and this is k.,00:08:05.400,00:08:09.080
"And the good thing here is that I didn't
appeal to any hypothesis set, or",00:08:09.080,00:08:13.350
any input space.,00:08:13.350,00:08:14.530
"This is a purely combinatorial
quantity.",00:08:14.530,00:08:16.820
"And because it's a combinatorial quantity,
I am going to be able to pin",00:08:16.820,00:08:19.470
"it down exactly, as it turns out.",00:08:19.470,00:08:22.670
"And now, when I pin it down exactly, you
go and you find the fanciest input",00:08:22.670,00:08:26.910
"space, and the fanciest hypothesis set.",00:08:26.910,00:08:28.930
"You pick the break point for that, and
you use that here, ridding the",00:08:28.930,00:08:35.630
"problem of all the other aspects, and
you still are able to make an upper",00:08:35.630,00:08:39.090
bound statement.,00:08:39.090,00:08:39.780
"You can say that the growth function,
for the particular case you talked",00:08:39.780,00:08:43.059
"about, is less than or equal
to-- and just go to this",00:08:43.059,00:08:45.610
combinatorial quantity.,00:08:45.610,00:08:47.790
The plan is clear.,00:08:47.790,00:08:49.550
"So let's look at the bound
for B of N, k.",00:08:49.550,00:08:52.890
And we are going to do it recursively.,00:08:52.890,00:08:54.150
"It's a very cute argument, and I am
going to build it very carefully.",00:08:54.150,00:08:57.530
So I want your attention.,00:08:57.530,00:09:00.900
Consider the following table.,00:09:00.900,00:09:02.160
"Very much like the puzzle, we are
going to list x_1, x_2, up to x_N.",00:09:02.160,00:09:07.040
"N points, which used
to be three points.",00:09:07.040,00:09:09.390
"And I am going to try to put as many
patterns as I can, under a constraint",00:09:09.390,00:09:13.910
that there is a break point.,00:09:13.910,00:09:15.780
"So I will be putting the first pattern
this way, and the second pattern, and so",00:09:15.780,00:09:21.430
"on, trying to fill this table.",00:09:21.430,00:09:24.290
"Now, I am going to do a structural
analysis of this, and this will happen",00:09:24.290,00:09:31.040
through this division.,00:09:31.040,00:09:32.840
Let's look at it.,00:09:32.840,00:09:34.120
"Still the same problem, x_1
and x_N is my vector.",00:09:34.120,00:09:37.640
"And I am trying to fill this with
as many rows as possible, under",00:09:37.640,00:09:40.540
a constraint of a break point.,00:09:40.540,00:09:42.390
"But now I am going to isolate
the last point.",00:09:42.390,00:09:45.370
Why am I isolating the last point?,00:09:45.370,00:09:46.660
Because I want a recursion.,00:09:46.660,00:09:48.340
"I want to be able to relate this fellow,
to the same fellow applied to",00:09:48.340,00:09:52.890
smaller quantities.,00:09:52.890,00:09:54.540
"And you have seen enough of that to
realize that, if I manage to do that, I",00:09:54.540,00:09:57.490
"might be able to actually
solve for B of N and k.",00:09:57.490,00:10:00.520
"That's why I'm isolating
the last point.",00:10:00.520,00:10:03.470
"After I do the isolation, I am going
to group the rows of the big",00:10:03.470,00:10:10.890
"matrix, into some groups.",00:10:10.890,00:10:13.540
"This is just my way
of looking at things.",00:10:13.540,00:10:15.990
I haven't changed anything.,00:10:15.990,00:10:17.650
"What I am going to do, I am going to
shuffle the rows around, after you have",00:10:17.650,00:10:22.310
constructed them.,00:10:22.310,00:10:23.020
"So we have a full matrix now, and I am
shuffling them, and putting some guys",00:10:23.020,00:10:27.210
in the first group.,00:10:27.210,00:10:29.150
"And the first group I
am going to call S_1.",00:10:29.150,00:10:33.110
"Here is the definition
of the group S_1.",00:10:33.110,00:10:36.020
"These are the rows that appear
only once, as far as x_1 up to",00:10:36.020,00:10:42.480
x_N-1 are concerned.,00:10:42.480,00:10:45.500
"Well, every row in its entirety appears
only once, because these are",00:10:45.500,00:10:50.610
different rows.,00:10:50.610,00:10:51.400
"That's how I'm constructing
the matrix.",00:10:51.400,00:10:53.410
"But if you take out the last guy, it is
conceivable that the first N minus",00:10:53.410,00:10:57.790
"1 coordinates happen twice, once with
extension -1, once with",00:10:57.790,00:11:02.280
extension +1.,00:11:02.280,00:11:03.950
"So I am taking the guys that
go with only one extension,",00:11:03.950,00:11:07.050
whatever it might be.,00:11:07.050,00:11:07.810
"Could be -1 or could be +1,
but not both, and putting",00:11:07.810,00:11:10.860
them in this group.,00:11:10.860,00:11:12.980
Fairly well defined.,00:11:12.980,00:11:16.700
"So you fill it up, and these are all the
rows that have a single extension.",00:11:16.700,00:11:22.480
"Now, you go under this, and you
define the number of rows in",00:11:22.480,00:11:28.400
this group to be alpha.,00:11:28.400,00:11:29.470
It is a number.,00:11:29.470,00:11:30.250
I am just going to call it alpha.,00:11:30.250,00:11:32.510
"And you can see where this is going,
because now I'm going to claim that",00:11:32.510,00:11:36.380
"the B of N and k, which is the total
number of rows in the entire matrix,",00:11:36.380,00:11:40.460
is alpha plus something.,00:11:40.460,00:11:42.800
That is obvious.,00:11:42.800,00:11:43.270
"I have already taken care of alpha,
and I am going to add up the",00:11:43.270,00:11:45.830
other stuff later on.,00:11:45.830,00:11:49.260
So what is the other stuff?,00:11:49.260,00:11:51.730
"That is the stuff I am
going to call S_2.",00:11:51.730,00:11:54.100
"And you probably have a good
guess what these are.",00:11:54.100,00:11:56.410
"These are the guys that happen
with both patterns.",00:11:56.410,00:12:01.830
"That is, they happen with extension
+1 and with -1.",00:12:01.830,00:12:05.980
That is disjoint from the first group.,00:12:05.980,00:12:08.060
"A typical member will
look like this.",00:12:08.060,00:12:11.530
"This is the same guy from x_1 up to
x_N-1, as it appears here.",00:12:11.530,00:12:16.850
"It just appears here with +1,
and appears here with -1.",00:12:16.850,00:12:22.080
And I keep doing it.,00:12:22.080,00:12:23.040
"So what I'm doing, I just reorganize
the rows of the matrix to",00:12:23.040,00:12:26.180
fall into these nice categories.,00:12:26.180,00:12:27.430
The other guy?,00:12:27.430,00:12:27.980
Exactly the same thing.,00:12:27.980,00:12:29.170
"So the second one corresponds to
the second one, and so on.",00:12:29.170,00:12:34.330
"Now, that covers all the rows.",00:12:34.330,00:12:37.590
I look at x_1 up to x_N-1.,00:12:37.590,00:12:39.270
"I either have both extensions,
or one extension. That's it.",00:12:39.270,00:12:42.580
"One extension belongs to the first
group. Two extensions belong to the",00:12:42.580,00:12:45.650
"second group in both ways,
with +1 and -1.",00:12:45.650,00:12:49.540
"In terms of the counting, this has
beta rows, whatever beta might be.",00:12:49.540,00:12:54.020
"This also has beta rows, because
they're identical.",00:12:54.020,00:12:56.620
"And therefore, the number B of N and
K, which I'm interested in, is",00:12:56.620,00:13:02.520
alpha plus 2 beta.,00:13:02.520,00:13:06.810
That is complete.,00:13:06.810,00:13:07.390
Just calling things names.,00:13:07.390,00:13:10.520
"So now, I am going to try to find
a handle on alphas and betas, so that I",00:13:10.520,00:13:15.350
"can find a recursion for the big
function B of N and k.",00:13:15.350,00:13:19.160
"B of N and k are the maximum
number of rows--",00:13:19.160,00:13:22.880
"patterns I can get on N points,
such that no k columns have",00:13:22.880,00:13:30.140
all possible patterns.,00:13:30.140,00:13:32.780
That's the definition.,00:13:32.780,00:13:34.040
"I am going to relate that to the same
quantity on smaller numbers, smaller N",00:13:34.040,00:13:37.910
and smaller k.,00:13:37.910,00:13:39.160
 ,00:13:39.160,00:13:41.560
"So the first is to estimate
alpha and beta.",00:13:41.560,00:13:43.980
 ,00:13:43.980,00:13:46.990
"I'd like to ask you to focus on
the x_1 up to x_N-1 columns.",00:13:46.990,00:13:51.750
"And I am going to help you visually
do that, by graying out the rest.",00:13:51.750,00:13:57.990
 ,00:13:57.990,00:13:59.340
"Now for a moment, look at these.",00:13:59.340,00:14:02.220
Are these rows different?,00:14:02.220,00:14:04.940
"They used to be different when
you have the extension.",00:14:04.940,00:14:07.750
"Well, let me see.",00:14:07.750,00:14:09.200
"The first group, I know they
are different, because",00:14:09.200,00:14:11.480
they have one extension.,00:14:11.480,00:14:13.460
"If there is one which is repeated, then
it must be repeated with both",00:14:13.460,00:14:17.570
"extensions, in order to get different
rows all over, and that violates the",00:14:17.570,00:14:22.520
condition for being here.,00:14:22.520,00:14:23.730
"They are here because they
have only one extension.",00:14:23.730,00:14:27.000
These guys are the same.,00:14:27.000,00:14:28.920
"This one appears with -1, and
here appears with +1.",00:14:28.920,00:14:32.700
"But if you cut the last guy, this
guy is identical to this guy, right?",00:14:32.700,00:14:39.470
"This second guy is identical
to the second guy.",00:14:39.470,00:14:42.820
"So I cannot count these
as different rows.",00:14:42.820,00:14:45.990
"I can do that when I gray
out one of the groups.",00:14:45.990,00:14:51.150
"Now, these are patently different.",00:14:51.150,00:14:54.480
"Nothing here is repeated, because we said
they have only one extension, and",00:14:54.480,00:14:58.220
they are all tucked in here.,00:14:58.220,00:15:00.040
"These two guys, there are no two guys
here that are equal, because they all",00:15:00.040,00:15:03.550
have the same extension.,00:15:03.550,00:15:05.290
"And supposedly, the whole row
makes it different rows.",00:15:05.290,00:15:09.770
"Therefore, these guys are
different from each other.",00:15:09.770,00:15:12.850
"And these guys are different from here
because again, if they are equal, then",00:15:12.850,00:15:16.770
I will have an extension.,00:15:16.770,00:15:18.010
"And then the guys here will belong to
a row that had both extensions.",00:15:18.010,00:15:22.190
Very easy.,00:15:22.190,00:15:22.780
"Just a verbose argument,
but we end up with these guys",00:15:22.780,00:15:26.410
being different.,00:15:26.410,00:15:27.930
"Now, I like the fact that these guys are
being different, because when they",00:15:27.930,00:15:30.900
"are different, I can relate
them to B of N and k.",00:15:30.900,00:15:33.700
"B of N and k was the maximum number of
patterns-- different rows,",00:15:33.700,00:15:38.280
that's how I am counting them--,00:15:38.280,00:15:39.610
such that a condition occurs.,00:15:39.610,00:15:41.560
"So what is the condition
that is occurring here?",00:15:41.560,00:15:44.310
"I can say that alpha plus beta, which
is the total number of rows or",00:15:44.310,00:15:49.460
"patterns in this mini-matrix, can I say
something about a break point for",00:15:49.460,00:15:55.290
this small matrix?,00:15:55.290,00:15:58.160
Yeah.,00:15:58.160,00:15:59.550
"The original matrix, I could
not find all possible",00:15:59.550,00:16:02.270
"patterns on any k columns, right?",00:16:02.270,00:16:05.830
"So I cannot possibly find all possible
patterns on any k columns on this",00:16:05.830,00:16:10.410
smaller set.,00:16:10.410,00:16:11.700
"Because if I find all possible patterns
on k columns here, they will",00:16:11.700,00:16:15.710
"serve as all possible patterns
in the big matrix.",00:16:15.710,00:16:19.050
"And I know, that doesn't exist.",00:16:19.050,00:16:21.570
"So I can now confidently say that alpha
plus beta, which is the number",00:16:21.570,00:16:25.850
"of different guys here, is less than or
equal to B of N minus 1, because I",00:16:25.850,00:16:31.920
"have only x_1 up to x_N-1,",00:16:31.920,00:16:34.730
"and k, because that is the break
point for these guys as well.",00:16:34.730,00:16:39.690
"Why am I saying less than
or equal to, not equal?",00:16:39.690,00:16:44.000
"When I constructed the original matrix,
it was equal by construction.",00:16:44.000,00:16:48.000
"I looked at the maximum number
of rows I get.",00:16:48.000,00:16:50.530
"And I told you this is
what I constructed.",00:16:50.530,00:16:52.230
"And therefore, by definition,
this is B of N and k.",00:16:52.230,00:16:55.210
"Here, I obtained this
in a special way.",00:16:55.210,00:16:58.250
"I took out a guy from the other
matrix, and did that.",00:16:58.250,00:17:01.670
"I am not sure that this is the best way
to maximize the number of rows.",00:17:01.670,00:17:04.930
At least it's conceivably not.,00:17:04.930,00:17:06.770
"But for sure it's at most B of
N minus 1 and k, because that",00:17:06.770,00:17:10.530
is the maximum number.,00:17:10.530,00:17:11.720
"I am safe saying that it's
less than or equal to.",00:17:11.720,00:17:13.980
 ,00:17:13.980,00:17:16.640
So I have the first one.,00:17:16.640,00:17:19.730
"Now, let's try to estimate
beta by itself.",00:17:19.730,00:17:21.810
This is the more subtle argument.,00:17:21.810,00:17:24.430
"In this case, we are going to
focus now on the second part",00:17:24.430,00:17:28.540
"only, the S_2 part.",00:17:28.540,00:17:30.410
"The guys that appear twice
in the big matrix.",00:17:30.410,00:17:34.010
So let's focus on them.,00:17:34.010,00:17:37.480
"Now, when I focus on them, these
guys are very easy to analyze.",00:17:37.480,00:17:41.020
"They are here and here
exactly the same.",00:17:41.020,00:17:44.040
"This block is identical
to this block.",00:17:44.040,00:17:48.550
"The interesting thing, when I look at
these guys, is that I am going to be",00:17:48.550,00:17:51.530
"able to argue that these guys have
a break point of k minus 1, not k.",00:17:51.530,00:18:00.272
The argument is very cute.,00:18:00.272,00:18:03.260
"Let's say that you have all possible
patterns on k minus 1 guys, in this",00:18:03.260,00:18:07.860
small matrix.,00:18:07.860,00:18:08.890
"First, I have to kill these.",00:18:08.890,00:18:11.106
"These are not different guys, because
these are identical to these.",00:18:11.106,00:18:14.540
"So let me reduce it to the guys
that are patently different.",00:18:14.540,00:18:17.930
I'm now looking at this matrix.,00:18:17.930,00:18:19.400
"I am claiming that k minus
1 is a break point here.",00:18:19.400,00:18:22.240
Why is that?,00:18:22.240,00:18:23.200
"Because if you had k minus 1 guys
here, where you get all possible",00:18:23.200,00:18:26.920
"patterns, then by adding both copies,
+1 and -1, and adding x_N, you",00:18:26.920,00:18:34.040
"will be getting k columns overall that
have all possible patterns, which you",00:18:34.040,00:18:40.312
"know you cannot have because k is
a break point for the whole thing.",00:18:40.312,00:18:44.310
"So now I'm taking advantage of the
fact that these guys repeat.",00:18:44.310,00:18:47.510
"It's very dangerous to have k minus 1
guys, because now I have the k that I",00:18:47.510,00:18:51.830
know doesn't exist.,00:18:51.830,00:18:53.620
Let's do it illustratively.,00:18:53.620,00:18:57.090
Here is a pattern here.,00:18:57.090,00:18:58.200
"You add the +1 extension
and the -1 extension,",00:18:58.200,00:19:00.640
by taking this column.,00:19:00.640,00:19:02.870
"If you get all possible patterns on k
minus 1, and you add this guy, then you",00:19:02.870,00:19:07.150
"have both patterns here, and you will
end up with all possible patterns on k",00:19:07.150,00:19:11.040
points on the overall matrix.,00:19:11.040,00:19:12.330
 ,00:19:12.330,00:19:14.950
"That enables me to actually count
this in terms of B of N and k, again,",00:19:14.950,00:19:19.500
with the proper values of N and k.,00:19:19.500,00:19:21.030
"We can say that beta is less than
or equal to-- again, less than or",00:19:21.030,00:19:24.630
"equal to because I obtained this
matrix by lots of eliminations.",00:19:24.630,00:19:27.620
"I didn't do it deliberately to maximize
the number, so I don't know",00:19:27.620,00:19:30.220
whether it's the maximum.,00:19:30.220,00:19:31.290
"But I sure know that it's less than or
equal to the maximum, by the definition",00:19:31.290,00:19:34.480
of what a maximum is.,00:19:34.480,00:19:36.410
And that would be of what?,00:19:36.410,00:19:38.420
"I have N minus 1 point and I argued
for a break point of k minus 1.",00:19:38.420,00:19:44.260
So I end up with this fellow.,00:19:44.260,00:19:47.630
Both arguments are very simple.,00:19:47.630,00:19:49.650
"Now, we pull the rabbit out of the hat!",00:19:49.650,00:19:53.230
You put it together.,00:19:53.230,00:19:54.580
What do we have?,00:19:54.580,00:19:55.610
This is the full matrix.,00:19:55.610,00:19:57.640
"The first item was just calling things
names, the number of rows in the big",00:19:57.640,00:20:02.530
"matrix is B of N and k,
by definition-- by construction.",00:20:02.530,00:20:06.460
"I organized it such that there is alpha,
and there is beta, and there is",00:20:06.460,00:20:10.190
"another beta, so this one is the first
result I got, which is B of N and k",00:20:10.190,00:20:14.350
equals alpha plus 2 beta.,00:20:14.350,00:20:16.910
What else did I get?,00:20:16.910,00:20:19.150
"I got that alpha plus beta is at
most B of N minus 1 and k.",00:20:19.150,00:20:24.240
"That was the first slide
of the analysis.",00:20:24.240,00:20:27.480
We have seen that.,00:20:27.480,00:20:28.990
"So this basically takes this matrix,
and does an analysis on it.",00:20:28.990,00:20:35.110
"And it has a break point k, because k
will be inherited when you go to the",00:20:35.110,00:20:38.500
bigger one.,00:20:38.500,00:20:39.090
That's what we did.,00:20:39.090,00:20:40.640
"The other one is, beta is less than
B of N minus 1 and k minus 1.",00:20:40.640,00:20:45.420
"And this is the case where I only looked
at this guy, and now I have to",00:20:45.420,00:20:48.970
"be more restrictive in terms of all
possible patterns, because I have",00:20:48.970,00:20:51.770
"an extension to add, and I would be
violating the big constraint.",00:20:51.770,00:20:54.650
"So I ended up with this being less
than or equal to B of N minus",00:20:54.650,00:20:57.100
1 and k minus 1.,00:20:57.100,00:20:59.760
Anybody notice anything in this slide?,00:20:59.760,00:21:03.530
"How convenient! I have alpha plus 2 beta
there, and I have alpha plus beta",00:21:03.530,00:21:07.700
"on one, and beta on one.",00:21:07.700,00:21:10.380
"If I add them, I am in business.",00:21:10.380,00:21:12.220
"I can actually now relate B of N and k
to other B of N and k, and alpha and",00:21:12.220,00:21:17.190
beta are gone.,00:21:17.190,00:21:19.900
"B of N and k, now I know, has
to be at most this fellow.",00:21:19.900,00:21:25.400
"So you can see where the
recursion is going.",00:21:25.400,00:21:28.440
"Now I know that this property
holds for the B of N and k.",00:21:28.440,00:21:32.210
"And now all I need to do is solve it, in
order to find an actual numerical",00:21:32.210,00:21:36.080
value for B of N and k.,00:21:36.080,00:21:37.690
"And that numerical value will serve as
an upper bound for any growth function",00:21:37.690,00:21:42.480
"of a hypothesis set that
has a break point k.",00:21:42.480,00:21:45.690
 ,00:21:45.690,00:21:48.450
"Let's do the numerical
computation first.",00:21:48.450,00:21:53.020
"I have this recursion, and I can see
that, from smaller values of N and",00:21:53.020,00:21:58.170
"K, I can get bigger values, or I can get
an upper bound on bigger values.",00:21:58.170,00:22:02.400
Let's do it in a table.,00:22:02.400,00:22:06.520
Here is a table.,00:22:06.520,00:22:07.900
"Here is the value of N-- 1, 2.",00:22:07.900,00:22:09.710
"This is the number of points, the
number of columns in the matrix.",00:22:09.710,00:22:13.470
And this is k.,00:22:13.470,00:22:14.420
"This is the break point
I am talking about.",00:22:14.420,00:22:16.240
"So this will be-- there's a break point
of 1, break point 2, break point",00:22:16.240,00:22:19.030
"3, et cetera.",00:22:19.030,00:22:20.540
"And what I'd like to do here, I'd like
to fill this table with an upper bound",00:22:20.540,00:22:24.960
on B of N and k.,00:22:24.960,00:22:25.930
"I'd like to put numbers here, that I know
that B of N and k can be at most",00:22:25.930,00:22:29.660
that number.,00:22:29.660,00:22:31.290
"And we can construct this matrix very,
very easily having this recursion.",00:22:31.290,00:22:35.060
Here's what we do.,00:22:35.060,00:22:38.000
"First, I fill the boundary conditions.",00:22:38.000,00:22:41.280
Let's look at this.,00:22:41.280,00:22:42.990
"Here it says that there
is a break point of 1.",00:22:42.990,00:22:47.360
"I cannot get all possible
patterns on one point.",00:22:47.360,00:22:51.435
"Well, what are all possible
patterns on one point?",00:22:51.435,00:22:55.080
-1 and +1.,00:22:55.080,00:22:55.930
It's one point.,00:22:55.930,00:22:57.200
"So I cannot get both
-1 and +1.",00:22:57.200,00:22:59.760
That's a pretty heavy restriction.,00:22:59.760,00:23:01.930
"So I'm asking myself, let's say you
have now N columns in the matrix.",00:23:01.930,00:23:05.930
"How many different rows can you get in
that matrix, under that constraint?",00:23:05.930,00:23:11.070
"Well, I'm in trouble.",00:23:11.070,00:23:12.240
"Because if I have the first pattern, and
then I put a second pattern, the",00:23:12.240,00:23:18.430
"second pattern must be different from
the first one in at least one column.",00:23:18.430,00:23:23.080
That's what makes it different.,00:23:23.080,00:23:24.080
"If it's identical in every column, then
it's not a different pattern, right?",00:23:24.080,00:23:28.490
"So you go to that point,
where it's different.",00:23:28.490,00:23:30.760
"And unfortunately, for that point
you get both possible patterns.",00:23:30.760,00:23:36.910
So we are stuck.,00:23:36.910,00:23:37.790
"We can only have one pattern
under this constraint.",00:23:37.790,00:23:41.715
"Hence, the 1's--",00:23:41.715,00:23:42.940
"1, 1, 1, 1, 1.",00:23:42.940,00:23:45.040
That's good.,00:23:45.040,00:23:46.670
"Now, in the other direction,
it's also easy.",00:23:46.670,00:23:51.160
"In this case, it's 2.",00:23:51.160,00:23:52.650
It's very easy to argue.,00:23:52.650,00:23:53.890
"Now, I am taking the case where
I have only one column.",00:23:53.890,00:23:58.250
"So I'm asking myself, how many patterns
I can get for one column.",00:23:58.250,00:24:02.145
"Well, the most is 2.",00:24:02.145,00:24:04.630
Why am I getting 2's here?,00:24:04.630,00:24:06.500
"Because in the upper diagonal of
this table, the constraint I",00:24:06.500,00:24:12.160
am putting is vacuous.,00:24:12.160,00:24:15.760
"Here, for example, I am telling you how
many different patterns can you",00:24:15.760,00:24:19.460
"get on one point, such that no four
points have all possible patterns.",00:24:19.460,00:24:26.750
"Four points, what are
you talking about?",00:24:26.750,00:24:27.990
You have only one point.,00:24:27.990,00:24:29.470
So that's no constraint at all.,00:24:29.470,00:24:32.090
"Therefore, it doesn't restrict the
choices, and the maximum number is the",00:24:32.090,00:24:35.530
"maximum number I would get unrestricted,
which happens to be 2.",00:24:35.530,00:24:39.080
"If I have one point,
I get two patterns.",00:24:39.080,00:24:40.970
"That's why you have the
2's sitting here.",00:24:40.970,00:24:44.030
"Now, I covered the boundary conditions,
and that's really all I need to",00:24:44.030,00:24:48.030
"complete the entire table, given the
nature of the constraint I have.",00:24:48.030,00:24:53.020
Why is that?,00:24:53.020,00:24:55.110
Because that constraint looks like this.,00:24:55.110,00:24:58.800
"If you know the solid blue guys, I
will tell you the empty blue guy.",00:24:58.800,00:25:03.770
"Because this would be--
look at N and k.",00:25:03.770,00:25:06.680
This is N and k.,00:25:06.680,00:25:08.680
This would be N minus 1 and k.,00:25:08.680,00:25:12.450
This would be N minus 1 and k minus 1.,00:25:12.450,00:25:16.170
That's exactly what this says.,00:25:16.170,00:25:19.460
"So if I have these two points, I can
get a value here, which will be",00:25:19.460,00:25:22.550
an upper bound on this fellow.,00:25:22.550,00:25:25.320
"Let us actually go through
this table, and fill it up.",00:25:25.320,00:25:29.370
"The first guy I'm going
to take is this 1 and 2.",00:25:29.370,00:25:32.940
"According to this shape, I might
be able to get this fellow.",00:25:32.940,00:25:36.350
What would that fellow be?,00:25:36.350,00:25:37.740
 ,00:25:37.740,00:25:40.400
"3, right?",00:25:40.400,00:25:41.930
You just add the two numbers.,00:25:41.930,00:25:43.680
How about the next guy?,00:25:43.680,00:25:46.340
Anybody has a guess here?,00:25:46.340,00:25:49.090
"OK, 4.",00:25:49.090,00:25:53.150
And then?,00:25:53.150,00:25:53.920
A bunch of 4's.,00:25:53.920,00:25:56.020
Always get 2's.,00:25:56.020,00:25:57.590
"I am actually happy about this because
you see that when k grows big, much",00:25:57.590,00:26:02.440
"bigger than N, as we said, the
constraint is vacuous.",00:26:02.440,00:26:05.060
"So I should be getting all
possible patterns on the",00:26:05.060,00:26:07.150
number of points I have.,00:26:07.150,00:26:08.390
"And as you can see, for
1, I get the 2's.",00:26:08.390,00:26:10.450
"For 2, I will get eventually the 4's.",00:26:10.450,00:26:12.760
"And for 3, it will be the 8's.",00:26:12.760,00:26:14.520
So that is very nice.,00:26:14.520,00:26:16.600
Let's go over the next row.,00:26:16.600,00:26:17.870
Can I solve this one?,00:26:17.870,00:26:18.820
"Now that I got this one, I can become
more sophisticated and get this one.",00:26:18.820,00:26:23.840
See where this came from?,00:26:23.840,00:26:25.810
"How about the next one,
what would that be?",00:26:25.810,00:26:27.710
"That should be 7, right?",00:26:27.710,00:26:28.960
 ,00:26:28.960,00:26:31.710
8.,00:26:31.710,00:26:33.710
A bunch of 8's.,00:26:33.710,00:26:35.480
This is kind of fun.,00:26:35.480,00:26:37.810
And you can fill up the entire table.,00:26:37.810,00:26:42.160
"So we have it completely
solved, numerically.",00:26:42.160,00:26:44.620
"It would be nice to have a formula,
which we will have in a minute.",00:26:44.620,00:26:47.510
"But numerically, we will have that.",00:26:47.510,00:26:50.650
"Now, let me highlight one guy.",00:26:50.650,00:26:53.480
"Do you see anything that
changed colors?",00:26:53.480,00:26:55.340
 ,00:26:55.340,00:26:58.060
"I claim that you have
seen this before.",00:26:58.060,00:26:59.355
 ,00:26:59.355,00:27:02.930
That's the puzzle.,00:27:02.930,00:27:04.180
 ,00:27:04.180,00:27:06.760
You had three points.,00:27:06.760,00:27:09.800
Your break point was 2.,00:27:09.800,00:27:12.060
"And now we know for a fact that the
maximum number you can get is 4,",00:27:12.060,00:27:16.510
"without having to go through
the entire torture we went",00:27:16.510,00:27:19.170
through last time.,00:27:19.170,00:27:20.120
Can we try this?,00:27:20.120,00:27:20.810
"Can we try that?
Oh, I am violating--",00:27:20.810,00:27:22.440
You don't have to do that.,00:27:22.440,00:27:23.960
"Here are the numbers, just by computing
a very simple recursion.",00:27:23.960,00:27:28.600
"Now, let's go for the analytic
version of that.",00:27:28.600,00:27:30.830
"What I'd like to do, I'd like to
find a formula that computes this",00:27:30.830,00:27:35.510
number outright.,00:27:35.510,00:27:36.540
"I don't have to go through this
computation numerically.",00:27:36.540,00:27:40.680
So let's do that.,00:27:40.680,00:27:41.920
"This is the analytic solution
for B of N and k.",00:27:41.920,00:27:44.060
 ,00:27:44.060,00:27:46.830
"Again, this is the recursion.",00:27:46.830,00:27:49.280
And now we have a theorem.,00:27:49.280,00:27:52.180
"Yeah, when you're doing mathematical
theory, you have to have theorems.",00:27:52.180,00:27:55.560
"Otherwise, you lose your
qualifications!",00:27:55.560,00:27:58.450
What does the theorem say?,00:27:58.450,00:27:59.810
 ,00:27:59.810,00:28:02.410
"It tells you that this is a formula
that is an upper bound",00:28:02.410,00:28:06.870
for B of N and k.,00:28:06.870,00:28:08.640
What is this formula?,00:28:08.640,00:28:09.620
"This is N choose i, the combinatorial
quantity.",00:28:09.620,00:28:13.420
"And you sum this up from
i equals 0 to k minus 1.",00:28:13.420,00:28:16.120
So both N and k appear.,00:28:16.120,00:28:17.660
"N appears as the number here, and k
appears as the limit for the index of",00:28:17.660,00:28:22.900
summation-- appears as k minus 1.,00:28:22.900,00:28:25.420
"This quantity will be an upper
bound for B of N and k.",00:28:25.420,00:28:29.460
"You can now, if you believe that,
which we will argue in a moment,",00:28:29.460,00:28:33.320
you compute this number.,00:28:33.320,00:28:34.750
"And that will be an upper bound for the
growth function of any hypothesis",00:28:34.750,00:28:39.570
"set that has a break point k, without
asking any questions whatsoever about",00:28:39.570,00:28:43.970
the hypothesis set or the input space.,00:28:43.970,00:28:46.940
"It shouldn't come as a surprise
that this quantity is right, because if",00:28:46.940,00:28:51.400
"you look at this, this is really
screaming for something binomial or",00:28:51.400,00:28:56.560
combinatorial.,00:28:56.560,00:28:57.630
"Clearly, it will come
out one way or the other.",00:28:57.630,00:28:59.910
But why is it this way?,00:28:59.910,00:29:01.520
"Well, what we are going to show, we are
going to show that this is exactly",00:29:01.520,00:29:04.330
"the quantity we computed numerically
for the other table.",00:29:04.330,00:29:07.780
"And we are going to do
it by induction.",00:29:07.780,00:29:10.470
"So the recursion we did, we are just
going to do it analytically.",00:29:10.470,00:29:13.960
How do you do that?,00:29:13.960,00:29:16.370
You start with boundary conditions.,00:29:16.370,00:29:18.820
What were the boundary conditions?,00:29:18.820,00:29:20.060
"We argued that this is, indeed,
the value of B of N and k.",00:29:20.060,00:29:22.950
"And hence, an upper bound on
it, from the last slide.",00:29:22.950,00:29:26.120
"Now we want to verify that this
quantity actually returns those",00:29:26.120,00:29:30.110
"numbers, when you plug in the value
N equals 1 or k equals 1.",00:29:30.110,00:29:36.270
How do I do that?,00:29:36.270,00:29:38.190
You just do it.,00:29:38.190,00:29:39.560
"Just plug in, and it will come out.",00:29:39.560,00:29:41.040
I'm not going even to bother doing it.,00:29:41.040,00:29:42.750
It's a very simple formula.,00:29:42.750,00:29:43.700
"You just evaluate it, and you get that.",00:29:43.700,00:29:46.140
The interesting part is the recursion.,00:29:46.140,00:29:49.120
"I would like to argue that if
this formula holds for the solid blue",00:29:49.120,00:29:57.330
"points, then it will also
hold for this guy.",00:29:57.330,00:30:01.210
"And then by induction, since it holds
for all of these guys, I can just do",00:30:01.210,00:30:04.760
"this step by step and fill the schedule,
with the truth of this being",00:30:04.760,00:30:09.870
"the correct value for the numbers
that appear here.",00:30:09.870,00:30:15.160
"Everybody is clear
about the logic of it?",00:30:15.160,00:30:18.900
So let's do the induction.,00:30:18.900,00:30:21.200
We have the induction step.,00:30:21.200,00:30:22.660
"We just want to make clear
what the induction step is.",00:30:22.660,00:30:26.460
"You are going to assume that
the formula holds for this",00:30:26.460,00:30:33.640
point and this point.,00:30:33.640,00:30:36.290
"So indeed, if you plug in the values for
N and k, which here, N minus 1 and k",00:30:36.290,00:30:39.430
"minus 1, and here it would be N minus
1 and k, you plug it into that",00:30:39.430,00:30:43.070
particular formula.,00:30:43.070,00:30:45.250
Then the numbers will be correct.,00:30:45.250,00:30:47.090
That's the assumption.,00:30:47.090,00:30:49.100
"And then you prove that, if this is true,
then the formula will hold here.",00:30:49.100,00:30:53.610
That's the induction step.,00:30:53.610,00:30:55.890
Fair enough.,00:30:55.890,00:30:56.900
So let's do that.,00:30:56.900,00:30:59.910
This is the formula for N and k.,00:30:59.910,00:31:02.020
You just need to remember it.,00:31:02.020,00:31:04.290
N appears here and k appears here.,00:31:04.290,00:31:06.610
"Minus 1 is an integral
part of the formula.",00:31:06.610,00:31:08.850
"This is the value for
k, not for k minus 1.",00:31:08.850,00:31:11.740
"The value, for k, happens to be the sum
from i equals 0 to that k, minus 1.",00:31:11.740,00:31:16.520
"So this is the formula that
is supposed to be here.",00:31:16.520,00:31:21.190
"And we would like to argue
that this is equal to--",00:31:21.190,00:31:25.880
what is this one?,00:31:25.880,00:31:26.840
"This one is for N minus 1, and still k.",00:31:26.840,00:31:32.020
So this would be--,00:31:32.020,00:31:32.910
I am moved from here to here.,00:31:32.910,00:31:36.000
So this will be the value here.,00:31:36.000,00:31:38.830
And what is the other guy?,00:31:38.830,00:31:41.720
That will be the value for N minus 1.,00:31:41.720,00:31:43.870
"And now it's for k minus 1, because
you still take the other minus 1.",00:31:43.870,00:31:46.940
It becomes k minus 2.,00:31:46.940,00:31:48.230
This part belongs here.,00:31:48.230,00:31:51.860
So this is the induction step.,00:31:51.860,00:31:53.120
We don't have it yet.,00:31:53.120,00:31:54.000
That's what we want to establish.,00:31:54.000,00:31:55.140
"So let me put a question mark
to make sure that we haven't",00:31:55.140,00:31:57.580
established it yet.,00:31:57.580,00:31:59.920
"What I am going to do, I am going to
take the right-hand side, and keep",00:31:59.920,00:32:04.230
"reducing it, until the left-hand
side appears.",00:32:04.230,00:32:07.290
That's all.,00:32:07.290,00:32:08.200
"And then we'll be done with
the induction step.",00:32:08.200,00:32:10.070
"And since we have the boundary
conditions, we will have proved the",00:32:10.070,00:32:13.480
theorem we asserted.,00:32:13.480,00:32:16.570
"The first thing I am going to do,
I am going to look at this fellow.",00:32:16.570,00:32:20.380
"And I notice that the index goes
here from i equals 0 to k minus 1.",00:32:20.380,00:32:24.290
"Here, it goes from i equals 0
to k minus 2.",00:32:24.290,00:32:26.820
I'd like to merge the two summations.,00:32:26.820,00:32:29.110
"So in order to merge the two summations,
I will make them the same",00:32:29.110,00:32:31.680
"number of terms, first.",00:32:31.680,00:32:33.970
"Very easy. I will just take the zeroth
term, which would be N minus 1 choose",00:32:33.970,00:32:38.280
"0, which is 1, out.",00:32:38.280,00:32:40.500
"And now the summation goes from
i equals 1 to k minus 1.",00:32:40.500,00:32:45.410
"Now, I go to the other
guy and do this.",00:32:45.410,00:32:49.400
What did I do?,00:32:49.400,00:32:51.010
"I just changed the name of
the dummy variable i.",00:32:51.010,00:32:54.480
"I wanted the index to go from 1
to k minus 1, in order to be",00:32:54.480,00:32:57.530
able to merge it easily.,00:32:57.530,00:32:58.810
"Here, it goes from 0 to k minus 2.",00:32:58.810,00:33:00.960
So what do I do?,00:33:00.960,00:33:02.030
"I just make this i, and
make this i minus 1.",00:33:02.030,00:33:04.630
"So i minus 1 goes from 0 to k
minus 2, as this i used to.",00:33:04.630,00:33:08.910
Just changing the names.,00:33:08.910,00:33:10.860
"And now, having done that, I am ready
to merge the two summations.",00:33:10.860,00:33:15.580
And they are merged.,00:33:15.580,00:33:19.160
"Now, I would like to be able to take
this, and produce one quantity.",00:33:19.160,00:33:25.390
And you can do it by brute force.,00:33:25.390,00:33:27.240
This is no mysterious quantity.,00:33:27.240,00:33:28.290
This is what?,00:33:28.290,00:33:28.760
"This is N minus 1 times N minus
2 times N minus 3, i terms,",00:33:28.760,00:33:33.930
divided by i factorial.,00:33:33.930,00:33:35.890
And this one applies the same thing.,00:33:35.890,00:33:37.700
"So you end up with something, and then
you do all kinds of algebra, and it",00:33:37.700,00:33:43.220
looks familiar.,00:33:43.220,00:33:43.880
"And then you reduce it
to another quantity.",00:33:43.880,00:33:45.310
"So there's always an algebraic
way of reducing it.",00:33:45.310,00:33:47.950
"But I am going to reduce it with a very
simple combinatorial argument.",00:33:47.950,00:33:51.830
I am going to claim that this is--,00:33:51.830,00:33:53.680
the 1 remains the same.,00:33:53.680,00:33:55.790
"And this actually, the whole thing
here reduces to N choose i.",00:33:55.790,00:33:58.720
So these two guys become this one.,00:33:58.720,00:34:01.850
"Instead of doing the algebra,
I am going to give you",00:34:01.850,00:34:05.060
a combinatorial argument.,00:34:05.060,00:34:06.710
"That is, this quantity is identical
to N choose i.",00:34:06.710,00:34:11.650
"Let's say that I am trying to choose
10 people from this room.",00:34:11.650,00:34:17.719
"And let's say that the room
has N people.",00:34:17.719,00:34:20.699
There are N people.,00:34:20.699,00:34:22.500
"How many ways can you chose 10
people out of this room?",00:34:22.500,00:34:28.000
That is N choose 10.,00:34:28.000,00:34:31.949
Let's put this on the side.,00:34:31.949,00:34:34.320
Here is another way of counting it.,00:34:34.320,00:34:37.870
"We can count the number of ways you can
pick 10 people, excluding me, plus",00:34:37.870,00:34:44.290
"the number of ways you can pick
10 people, including me.",00:34:44.290,00:34:50.150
Right?,00:34:50.150,00:34:50.550
"These are disjoint, and they
cover all the cases.",00:34:50.550,00:34:53.540
Let's look at excluding me.,00:34:53.540,00:34:55.480
"How many ways can you pick 10 people
from the room, excluding me?",00:34:55.480,00:35:00.720
"Well, then you are picking the
10 people from N minus 1.",00:35:00.720,00:35:04.220
I am the minus 1.,00:35:04.220,00:35:06.110
So that would be N minus 1 choose 10.,00:35:06.110,00:35:10.080
Put this in the bank.,00:35:10.080,00:35:13.310
"How many ways can you pick
10 people, including me?",00:35:13.310,00:35:17.890
"Well, you already decided you are
including me, so you are only deciding",00:35:17.890,00:35:20.410
on the 9 remaining guys.,00:35:20.410,00:35:22.820
So that would be N minus 1 choose 9.,00:35:22.820,00:35:27.510
"So we have N minus 1 choose 10, plus
N minus 1 choose 9, that equals the",00:35:27.510,00:35:32.750
"original number, which
was N choose 10.",00:35:32.750,00:35:37.020
Look at this.,00:35:37.020,00:35:37.730
What do we have?,00:35:37.730,00:35:38.980
 ,00:35:38.980,00:35:41.800
This is excluding me.,00:35:41.800,00:35:43.900
This is including me.,00:35:43.900,00:35:45.820
And this is the original count.,00:35:45.820,00:35:47.930
"So it's a combinatorial identity, and
we don't have to go through the",00:35:47.930,00:35:50.730
"torture of the algebra in order to
prove that it's exactly the same.",00:35:50.730,00:35:55.260
"Now, I go back.",00:35:55.260,00:35:56.520
"I look, this goes from
i equals 1 to k minus 1.",00:35:56.520,00:35:59.140
"I have this 1, so I conveniently put
it back, and get this formula.",00:35:59.140,00:36:04.240
Have you seen it before?,00:36:04.240,00:36:06.585
"Yeah, it looks familiar.",00:36:06.585,00:36:07.690
"Oh, this is the one we want to prove.",00:36:07.690,00:36:09.930
So it means that we are done.,00:36:09.930,00:36:13.380
That's it.,00:36:13.380,00:36:14.380
"We have an exact solution for the
upper bound on B of N and k.",00:36:14.380,00:36:20.150
"Since we spent some time developing
it, let's look at it and",00:36:20.150,00:36:25.980
"celebrate it, and be happy about it.",00:36:25.980,00:36:28.450
"First thing: yes, it's a polynomial,
because all of this torture was to get",00:36:28.450,00:36:32.880
"a polynomial, right?",00:36:32.880,00:36:34.415
"If we did all of this, and it's perfect
math, and the end result was not",00:36:34.415,00:36:37.870
"a polynomial, then we are in trouble.",00:36:37.870,00:36:39.460
"Because although the quantity is
correct, it's not going to be useful",00:36:39.460,00:36:42.850
in the utility that we are aiming at.,00:36:42.850,00:36:45.560
So why is it polynomial?,00:36:45.560,00:36:47.650
"Remember that for a particular
hypothesis set, the break point is",00:36:47.650,00:36:51.950
a fixed point.,00:36:51.950,00:36:52.510
"It doesn't grow with N. You
ask in a hypothesis set,",00:36:52.510,00:36:55.500
"can I get all possible dichotomies
on four points?",00:36:55.500,00:36:59.490
That's a question for the perceptron.,00:36:59.490,00:37:00.820
No.,00:37:00.820,00:37:01.540
"Then 4, in the perceptron,
is a break point.",00:37:01.540,00:37:04.670
"Now, I can ask myself what the
perceptron does on 100 points.",00:37:04.670,00:37:08.040
"And the break point is still
4, just a constant.",00:37:08.040,00:37:11.370
"You give me a hypothesis set,
I give you a break point.",00:37:11.370,00:37:14.060
That's a fixed number.,00:37:14.060,00:37:15.310
 ,00:37:15.310,00:37:17.930
"So according to our argument now, the
growth function for a hypothesis set",00:37:17.930,00:37:23.680
"that has a break point k is less than or
equal to the purely combinatorial",00:37:23.680,00:37:29.860
"quantity, B of N and k, which is defined
as the maximum such number of",00:37:29.860,00:37:34.470
"dichotomies you can get, under the
constraint that k is a break point.",00:37:34.470,00:37:38.230
"And that was less than or equal
to the nice formula we had.",00:37:38.230,00:37:41.550
So we can now make this statement.,00:37:41.550,00:37:44.450
"You go in a real learning
situation.",00:37:44.450,00:37:47.430
"Let's say you have a neural network
making a decision, and you tell me the",00:37:47.430,00:37:50.740
"break point for that neural
network is 17.",00:37:50.740,00:37:54.730
"I don't ask you what is a neural
network, because we don't know yet, so",00:37:54.730,00:37:57.480
you don't have to know.,00:37:57.480,00:37:58.520
"I don't ask you what is the
dimensionality of the Euclidean space",00:37:58.520,00:38:01.020
you are working on.,00:38:01.020,00:38:01.980
You told me 17.,00:38:01.980,00:38:02.910
"Your growth function of your neural
network that I don't know, in",00:38:02.910,00:38:07.430
"the space that I don't know, happens to
be less than or equal to that, and I",00:38:07.430,00:38:10.700
know that I'm correct.,00:38:10.700,00:38:13.570
So is this quantity polynomial in N?,00:38:13.570,00:38:16.470
That's what we need.,00:38:16.470,00:38:17.570
"Because remember, in the Hoeffding, there
was a negative exponential in N.",00:38:17.570,00:38:21.370
"If we get this to be polynomial
in N, we are in business.",00:38:21.370,00:38:24.450
"Well, any one of those guys is what?",00:38:24.450,00:38:28.130
"N times N minus 1 times N minus 2,
i times, divided by i factorial.",00:38:28.130,00:38:33.110
"i factorial doesn't matter,
it's a constant.",00:38:33.110,00:38:34.760
"So you basically get N multiplied by
itself a number of times, i times, for",00:38:34.760,00:38:38.790
the i-th term.,00:38:38.790,00:38:40.320
"The most that N will be multiplied by
itself is when you get to i equals",00:38:40.320,00:38:44.330
"k minus 1, the maximum.",00:38:44.330,00:38:46.160
"And then N will be multiplied
by itself k minus 1 times.",00:38:46.160,00:38:49.980
"Therefore, the maximum power in this
quantity is N to the k minus 1.",00:38:49.980,00:38:59.070
"This comes from N times N minus
1 times N minus 2 times--",00:38:59.070,00:39:03.860
"k times, that corresponds to the
case where i equals k minus 1.",00:39:03.860,00:39:07.860
"When you get N choose k minus
1, that's what you get.",00:39:07.860,00:39:10.680
"Anything else, will give you a power
of N, but it's a smaller power.",00:39:10.680,00:39:14.670
This is the most you will have.,00:39:14.670,00:39:16.770
What do we know about this fellow k?,00:39:16.770,00:39:19.080
We know it's just a number.,00:39:19.080,00:39:20.910
It's a constant.,00:39:20.910,00:39:21.620
"It doesn't change with N. And
therefore, this is indeed",00:39:21.620,00:39:25.690
"a polynomial in N. And we have achieved
what we set out to do.",00:39:25.690,00:39:32.110
That is pretty good.,00:39:32.110,00:39:35.910
"Let's take three examples, in order to
make this relate to experiences we",00:39:35.910,00:39:40.060
had before.,00:39:40.060,00:39:41.310
 ,00:39:41.310,00:39:44.540
This is the famous quantity by now.,00:39:44.540,00:39:46.080
You know it by heart.,00:39:46.080,00:39:47.300
I have the N.,00:39:47.300,00:39:48.060
I remember k.,00:39:48.060,00:39:48.730
I have to put minus 1.,00:39:48.730,00:39:49.760
"And that is the upper bound for anything
that has a break point k.",00:39:49.760,00:39:53.210
"Now, let's take hypothesis sets we
looked at before, for which we computed",00:39:53.210,00:39:58.380
"the growth function explicitly, and see
if they actually satisfy the bound.",00:39:58.380,00:40:03.280
"They had better, because this is math.",00:40:03.280,00:40:04.760
We proved it.,00:40:04.760,00:40:05.760
"But just to see that this
is, indeed, the case.",00:40:05.760,00:40:08.260
Positive rays.,00:40:08.260,00:40:10.265
"Oh, remember positive rays
from some time ago?",00:40:10.265,00:40:13.460
"We have one dimension,
so just the real line.",00:40:13.460,00:40:15.870
"Then we take from a point on,
it goes to +1.",00:40:15.870,00:40:19.170
"And we said that the whole analysis
here is exactly to",00:40:19.170,00:40:22.590
avoid what I just did.,00:40:22.590,00:40:23.790
"You don't have to tell
me what is the input.",00:40:23.790,00:40:25.640
You don't have to tell me--,00:40:25.640,00:40:26.650
you just have to tell me what?,00:40:26.650,00:40:29.360
What is the break point?,00:40:29.360,00:40:32.810
That's all we want.,00:40:32.810,00:40:34.530
you can call it positive rays.,00:40:34.530,00:40:36.500
"You can call it George, I don't care!",00:40:36.500,00:40:38.020
It has a break point of 2.,00:40:38.020,00:40:39.930
That's what I pull.,00:40:39.930,00:40:42.630
"We did compute the growth
function for the positive rays.",00:40:42.630,00:40:46.440
We did it by brute force.,00:40:46.440,00:40:47.600
"We looked at it, and we see what
the patterns are, and did",00:40:47.600,00:40:49.690
a combinatorial argument.,00:40:49.690,00:40:50.670
"And we ended up, that the growth function
for this guy is N plus 1.",00:40:50.670,00:40:54.360
"Let us see if this satisfies
the bound.",00:40:54.360,00:40:57.840
"This is supposedly
less than or equal to.",00:40:57.840,00:41:00.160
"And you substitute here for
N, which is the number here.",00:41:00.160,00:41:04.100
And the break point is k.,00:41:04.100,00:41:05.710
"So you're summing, from i equals
0 to 1, this quantity.",00:41:05.710,00:41:10.650
"You have N choose
0, also known as 1.",00:41:10.650,00:41:14.310
"Plus N choose 1, also known
as N. That's it.",00:41:14.310,00:41:19.040
"So you get this to be less
than or equal to--",00:41:19.040,00:41:21.560
wow!,00:41:21.560,00:41:22.810
 ,00:41:22.810,00:41:25.230
"Look at the analysis we did
to get the N plus 1.",00:41:25.230,00:41:27.430
And we get exactly the same.,00:41:27.430,00:41:28.640
With all the bounds and--,00:41:28.640,00:41:30.130
"we think that there is
a big slack here.",00:41:30.130,00:41:32.540
"But here, actually it's exactly tight.",00:41:32.540,00:41:34.130
"We get the same answer exactly, without
looking at anything of the geometry of",00:41:34.130,00:41:39.460
what the hypothesis set was.,00:41:39.460,00:41:42.490
Let's try another one.,00:41:42.490,00:41:43.230
Maybe we'll continue to be lucky.,00:41:43.230,00:41:44.780
Positive intervals.,00:41:44.780,00:41:45.860
"Yeah, I remember those were
the more sophisticated--",00:41:45.860,00:41:48.240
"oh, I'm sorry.",00:41:48.240,00:41:49.110
"I am not supposed to ask any questions
about the hypothesis.",00:41:49.110,00:41:51.000
I'm asking about the break point only.,00:41:51.000,00:41:52.680
I remember now.,00:41:52.680,00:41:53.800
So tell me what the break point is.,00:41:53.800,00:41:56.100
That was k equals 3.,00:41:56.100,00:41:58.730
"And we did compute the
growth function.",00:41:58.730,00:42:01.670
"Remember, this one was a funny one.",00:42:01.670,00:42:03.120
"We're picking two segments out of
N plus 1, and then adding the 1.",00:42:03.120,00:42:07.950
"So we ended up-- this
would be the formula.",00:42:07.950,00:42:10.940
"What would be the bound according
to the result we just had?",00:42:10.940,00:42:14.990
"This would be again, this formula.",00:42:14.990,00:42:16.380
And now k equals 3.,00:42:16.380,00:42:18.480
"So I have N choose 0 plus N
choose 1 plus N choose 2.",00:42:18.480,00:42:23.900
"I get 1 plus N plus something
that has squared terms.",00:42:23.900,00:42:27.030
"And I do the reduction
and what do I get?",00:42:27.030,00:42:31.900
"Boring, boring.",00:42:31.900,00:42:33.550
I seem to be getting it all the time.,00:42:33.550,00:42:36.290
It doesn't happen this way.,00:42:36.290,00:42:37.520
"It will always happen
that it's true.",00:42:37.520,00:42:40.420
"But there will be a slack
in many cases.",00:42:40.420,00:42:44.200
"So, we verified it.",00:42:44.200,00:42:46.140
"We are very comfortable
now with the result.",00:42:46.140,00:42:48.050
"Let's apply it to something where we
could not get the growth function.",00:42:48.050,00:42:53.120
Remember this old fellow?,00:42:53.120,00:42:54.940
"Well, in the two-dimensional perceptron,
we went through a full",00:42:54.940,00:42:57.710
"argument just to prove that
the break point is 4.",00:42:57.710,00:43:02.130
"But we didn't bother go through
a general number of points N, and ask",00:43:02.130,00:43:05.450
"ourselves, how many hypotheses can the
perceptron generate on N points?",00:43:05.450,00:43:09.820
Can you imagine the torture?,00:43:09.820,00:43:11.370
We do this--,00:43:11.370,00:43:12.500
can I get this pattern--,00:43:12.500,00:43:14.600
"And you have to do this for every
N. So we didn't do it.",00:43:14.600,00:43:17.230
The growth function is unknown to us.,00:43:17.230,00:43:19.810
We just know the break point.,00:43:19.810,00:43:21.570
"But using just that factor, we are
able to bound the growth function",00:43:21.570,00:43:25.240
completely.,00:43:25.240,00:43:26.080
"And you substitute again
with k equals 4.",00:43:26.080,00:43:28.410
"You get another term, which is cubic.",00:43:28.410,00:43:30.240
And you do the reduction.,00:43:30.240,00:43:31.750
"And lo and behold, you
have that statement.",00:43:31.750,00:43:34.120
"That statement holds for the perceptrons
in two dimensions.",00:43:34.120,00:43:37.700
"And you can see that this
will apply to anything.",00:43:37.700,00:43:40.340
"So now it was all worth the trouble,
because now we have a very simple",00:43:40.340,00:43:44.010
characterization of hypothesis sets.,00:43:44.010,00:43:46.870
"And we can take this, and
move to the other part.",00:43:46.870,00:43:51.870
"Remember, this part, which has now
disappeared is proving that it's",00:43:51.870,00:43:55.900
polynomial.,00:43:55.900,00:43:56.420
"Proving that we are interested
in the growth function.",00:43:56.420,00:43:59.170
"If it wasn't polynomial, we wouldn't
be interested in it.",00:43:59.170,00:44:01.340
"Now, this is an interesting
quantity.",00:44:01.340,00:44:04.440
"This one tells us that-- oh, and by the
way, it's not only interesting.",00:44:04.440,00:44:07.820
You actually can use it.,00:44:07.820,00:44:09.670
"We can put it in the Hoeffding
inequality, and claim that the",00:44:09.670,00:44:12.090
"Hoeffding inequality is true
using the growth function.",00:44:12.090,00:44:14.390
 ,00:44:14.390,00:44:16.900
"Now let's see what we want, to remind
you of the context of substituting for",00:44:16.900,00:44:24.110
"the total number of hypotheses
by the growth function.",00:44:24.110,00:44:28.330
"We wanted, instead of
having this fellow--",00:44:28.330,00:44:31.630
"this is Hoeffding, and this is the number
of hypotheses using the union",00:44:31.630,00:44:35.380
"bound, which we said is next
to useless whenever M",00:44:35.380,00:44:37.810
"is big, or M is infinite.",00:44:37.810,00:44:39.930
"And instead of that, we wanted
really to substitute for this",00:44:39.930,00:44:43.020
by the growth function.,00:44:43.020,00:44:44.640
So this is what we are trying to do.,00:44:44.640,00:44:46.145
"We are trying to justify that instead
of this, you can actually say that.",00:44:46.145,00:44:49.540
"Well, it turns out that this is not
exactly what we are going to say.",00:44:49.540,00:44:53.140
"We are going to modify the constants
here for technical reasons that will",00:44:53.140,00:44:56.690
become clear.,00:44:56.690,00:44:57.670
But the essence is the same.,00:44:57.670,00:44:58.970
"There would be the growth
function here.",00:44:58.970,00:45:00.560
"It will be polynomial in N, and it
will be killed by the negative",00:45:00.560,00:45:03.980
"exponential, provided that there is
a break point-- any break point.",00:45:03.980,00:45:09.280
"Now, how are we going
to prove that?",00:45:09.280,00:45:10.880
 ,00:45:10.880,00:45:14.100
"We are going to have
a pictorial proof.",00:45:14.100,00:45:16.000
"What a relief, because I think
you are exhausted by now.",00:45:16.000,00:45:19.140
"So the formal proof is
in the Appendix.",00:45:19.140,00:45:22.150
It's six pages.,00:45:22.150,00:45:23.830
"My purpose of the presentation here
is to give you the key points in",00:45:23.830,00:45:27.820
"the proof, so that you don't get
lost in epsilon's and delta's.",00:45:27.820,00:45:31.690
"There are basically certain things
you need to establish.",00:45:31.690,00:45:34.520
"And once you know that that's what you
are looking for, you can bite the",00:45:34.520,00:45:37.210
bullet and go through it line by line.,00:45:37.210,00:45:40.280
The two aspects are the following.,00:45:40.280,00:45:43.230
Why did we do this growth function?,00:45:43.230,00:45:46.370
"We used the growth function because it's
smaller, so it will be helpful.",00:45:46.370,00:45:49.750
But how could it possibly replace M?,00:45:49.750,00:45:53.020
"Because M was assuming no overlaps
at all in the bad regions.",00:45:53.020,00:45:57.860
Remember?,00:45:57.860,00:45:58.880
"So now that we know that there are
overlaps, this will take care of it.",00:45:58.880,00:46:03.160
"The question is, how does the
growth function actually",00:46:03.160,00:46:06.750
relate to the overlaps?,00:46:06.750,00:46:08.640
You need to establish that.,00:46:08.640,00:46:10.810
So this is the first one.,00:46:10.810,00:46:12.360
"And when we establish that, we find that
it's a completely clean argument at",00:46:12.360,00:46:15.680
"everything, except for
one annoying aspect.",00:46:15.680,00:46:18.860
"Growth function relates
to a finite sample.",00:46:18.860,00:46:21.290
"So we will get a perfect handle
on the E_in, the in-sample",00:46:21.290,00:46:24.710
error part of the deal.,00:46:24.710,00:46:26.590
"But in the Hoeffding inequality,
there is this E_out.",00:46:26.590,00:46:29.280
"And E_out relates to the performance
over the entire space.",00:46:29.280,00:46:32.740
"So we are no longer talking about
dichotomies, we are talking about full",00:46:32.740,00:46:35.270
hypotheses.,00:46:35.270,00:46:36.510
"We lose the benefit of
the growth function.",00:46:36.510,00:46:39.920
So what do we do about E out?,00:46:39.920,00:46:41.440
"That was a question that
was asked last time.",00:46:41.440,00:46:43.650
"What to do about E_out, in order
to get the argument to conform",00:46:43.650,00:46:48.130
"while we are just using a finite
sample, is the second step.",00:46:48.130,00:46:51.740
"After that, it's a technical
putting it together, in order to get",00:46:51.740,00:46:54.620
the final result.,00:46:54.620,00:46:55.580
That's the plan.,00:46:55.580,00:46:56.990
But the proofs are pictures.,00:46:56.990,00:46:58.840
So let's have a blank page.,00:46:58.840,00:47:01.180
"And let's say you are an artist
and this is your canvas.",00:47:01.180,00:47:06.240
It's a very special canvas.,00:47:06.240,00:47:08.400
It's the canvas of data sets.,00:47:08.400,00:47:13.520
What is that?,00:47:13.520,00:47:15.190
"Every point here is an entire
data set, x_1, x_2, up to x_N.",00:47:15.190,00:47:21.110
Fix N in your mind.,00:47:21.110,00:47:22.600
So this is one vector.,00:47:22.600,00:47:24.190
This is another vector.,00:47:24.190,00:47:25.190
This is another vector.,00:47:25.190,00:47:26.900
"And this canvas covers the entire
set of possible data sets.",00:47:26.900,00:47:32.920
"Now, why am I doing this space?",00:47:32.920,00:47:34.760
"Well, I am doing this space because the
event of being good or bad, whether",00:47:34.760,00:47:39.000
"E_in goes to E out, depends
on the sample.",00:47:39.000,00:47:41.610
Depends on the data set.,00:47:41.610,00:47:43.040
"For some data sets, you will
be close to the E_out.",00:47:43.040,00:47:46.410
"For some data sets, you are
not going to be close.",00:47:46.410,00:47:49.380
"So I want to draw it here, in order to
look at the bad regions and the",00:47:49.380,00:47:53.170
"overlaps, and then argue why
the growth function is",00:47:53.170,00:47:55.450
useful for the overlaps.,00:47:55.450,00:47:57.290
"Now, we assume that there's
a probability distribution.",00:47:57.290,00:47:59.430
"And for simplicity, let's say that the
area corresponds to the probability.",00:47:59.430,00:48:03.150
So the total area of the canvas is 1.,00:48:03.150,00:48:07.280
"Now, you look at the event, the
bad event, that E_in is",00:48:07.280,00:48:11.410
far away from E_out.,00:48:11.410,00:48:12.750
"And let's say that you paint
the points that correspond",00:48:12.750,00:48:15.980
to that event red.,00:48:15.980,00:48:17.780
"So you pick-- is this data
set good or bad?",00:48:17.780,00:48:19.610
"What does it mean, good or bad?",00:48:19.610,00:48:20.620
"I look at E_in in that data set, compare
it to E_out on a particular",00:48:20.620,00:48:23.760
"hypothesis, and then paint
it red if it's bad.",00:48:23.760,00:48:27.730
"So I have a hypothesis in mind, and I am
painting the points here red or",00:48:27.730,00:48:31.770
"leaving them alone, according to whether
they violate Hoeffding's",00:48:31.770,00:48:34.740
inequality or not.,00:48:34.740,00:48:37.530
"And I get this, just illustratively.",00:48:37.530,00:48:40.860
"And you realize that I didn't
paint a lot of area.",00:48:40.860,00:48:43.650
"And that is because of
Hoeffding inequality.",00:48:43.650,00:48:46.015
"Hoeffding inequality tells me
that that area is small.",00:48:46.015,00:48:49.990
So I'm entitled to put a small patch.,00:48:49.990,00:48:53.540
"Now we went from one hypothesis, which
is this guy, to the case where we have",00:48:53.540,00:48:59.860
"multiple hypotheses, using
the union bound.",00:48:59.860,00:49:02.470
"So again, this is the space of data
sets, exactly the same one.",00:49:02.470,00:49:05.830
"And now, I am saying for the first
hypothesis, you get this bad region.",00:49:05.830,00:49:11.860
"What happens when you have
a second hypothesis?",00:49:11.860,00:49:14.470
"Because I am using the very pessimistic
union bound, I am hedging",00:49:14.470,00:49:18.200
"my bets and saying you get
a bad region that is disjoint.",00:49:18.200,00:49:23.990
Another hypothesis--,00:49:23.990,00:49:26.920
two of them.,00:49:26.920,00:49:27.910
More.,00:49:27.910,00:49:30.460
More.,00:49:30.460,00:49:31.415
"Oh, no.",00:49:31.415,00:49:34.210
We are in trouble.,00:49:34.210,00:49:35.310
The colored area is the bad area.,00:49:35.310,00:49:37.170
Now the canvas is the bad area.,00:49:37.170,00:49:39.380
"That's why we get the problem
with the union bound.",00:49:39.380,00:49:42.790
"Because obviously, having them disjoint
fills up the canvas very quickly.",00:49:42.790,00:49:46.640
"Each of them is small, but
I have so many of them.",00:49:46.640,00:49:48.890
Infinity of them as a matter of fact.,00:49:48.890,00:49:50.360
This will overflow.,00:49:50.360,00:49:51.280
"Well, no, it won't overflow.",00:49:51.280,00:49:52.580
Just figuratively speaking.,00:49:52.580,00:49:54.660
So that's what I'm going to have.,00:49:54.660,00:49:57.010
"What is the argument
we are applying now?",00:49:57.010,00:50:00.180
We are not applying the union bound.,00:50:00.180,00:50:01.850
We are going to a new canvas.,00:50:01.850,00:50:04.440
"And that canvas is called the VC bound,
as in Vapnik-Chervonenkis.",00:50:04.440,00:50:10.700
We'll see it in a moment.,00:50:10.700,00:50:12.570
So what do you do?,00:50:12.570,00:50:13.400
"Your first hypothesis, same thing.",00:50:13.400,00:50:16.660
"When you take the second hypothesis,
you take the overlaps into",00:50:16.660,00:50:19.320
consideration.,00:50:19.320,00:50:21.340
So it falls here.,00:50:21.340,00:50:22.870
You get more.,00:50:22.870,00:50:24.270
You get more.,00:50:24.270,00:50:26.110
You get all of them.,00:50:26.110,00:50:27.360
 ,00:50:27.360,00:50:30.000
It's not as good as the first one.,00:50:30.000,00:50:32.500
I never expected it to be.,00:50:32.500,00:50:34.130
"But definitely not as bad as the
second one, because now they are",00:50:34.130,00:50:37.040
overlapping.,00:50:37.040,00:50:37.600
"And indeed, the total area, which is
the bad region-- something bad",00:50:37.600,00:50:41.200
happening--,00:50:41.200,00:50:42.000
"is a small fraction of
the whole thing.",00:50:42.000,00:50:44.070
And I can learn.,00:50:44.070,00:50:46.610
"So we are trying to characterize
this overlap.",00:50:46.610,00:50:50.180
"That's the whole deal with
the growth function.",00:50:50.180,00:50:52.620
"One way to do it is the one that
I alluded to before. Study the",00:50:52.620,00:50:56.910
hypothesis set.,00:50:56.910,00:50:58.030
Study the probability distribution.,00:50:58.030,00:50:59.930
"Get the full joint probability
distribution of any two events",00:50:59.930,00:51:02.940
"involving two hypotheses, and
then characterize this.",00:51:02.940,00:51:06.480
"Well, good luck!",00:51:06.480,00:51:08.170
We won't do that.,00:51:08.170,00:51:09.780
"The reason we introduced the growth
function, because it's an abstract",00:51:09.780,00:51:12.950
"quantity that is simple, and is going
to characterize the overlaps.",00:51:12.950,00:51:16.810
"The question is, how is the
growth function going to",00:51:16.810,00:51:19.530
characterize the overlaps?,00:51:19.530,00:51:20.930
Here is what is going to happen.,00:51:20.930,00:51:24.480
"I will tell you that if you look at
this canvas, if any point gets",00:51:24.480,00:51:29.510
"painted at all, it will get
painted over 100 times.",00:51:29.510,00:51:36.050
Let's say that I have that guarantee.,00:51:36.050,00:51:38.050
"I don't know which hypotheses
will paint it again.",00:51:38.050,00:51:40.330
"But any point that gets a red, it will
get a blue, and a green-- 100 times.",00:51:40.330,00:51:46.650
"If I tell you that statement, what
do you know about the total",00:51:46.650,00:51:50.020
area that is colored?,00:51:50.020,00:51:52.650
"Now it's, at most, one hundredth
of what it used to be.",00:51:52.650,00:51:57.480
"Because when I had them non-overlapping,
they filled it over.",00:51:57.480,00:52:00.330
"Now for every point that is colored,
I have to do it 100 times.",00:52:00.330,00:52:03.300
"So I am overusing these guys, and
these guys will have to shrink.",00:52:03.300,00:52:06.560
And I will get one hundredth of that.,00:52:06.560,00:52:09.160
"That is basically the essence
of the argument.",00:52:09.160,00:52:11.150
"What the growth function tells you is
that-- what is the growth function?",00:52:11.150,00:52:14.750
Number of dichotomies.,00:52:14.750,00:52:15.710
"If you take a dichotomy, this is not
the full hypothesis, but the",00:52:15.710,00:52:19.150
hypothesis on a finite set of points.,00:52:19.150,00:52:21.770
"There are many, many hypotheses that
return the exact same dichotomy.",00:52:21.770,00:52:28.860
"Remember the gray sheet
with the holes.",00:52:28.860,00:52:32.240
"Lots of stuff can be happening
behind the sheet.",00:52:32.240,00:52:34.410
"And as far am I am concerned, they
are all the same dichotomy.",00:52:34.410,00:52:37.610
"So all of these guys will be behaving
exactly the same way.",00:52:37.610,00:52:41.410
"If one of them colored the
point, the others will.",00:52:41.410,00:52:45.520
"This tells me that the
redundancy is captured",00:52:45.520,00:52:48.520
by the growth function.,00:52:48.520,00:52:50.700
That would be a very clean argument.,00:52:50.700,00:52:52.780
"And it would have been a very simple
proof, except for one annoyance.",00:52:52.780,00:52:57.200
"That the point being colored doesn't
depend only on the sample, but depends",00:52:57.200,00:53:01.780
also on the entire space.,00:53:01.780,00:53:03.680
"Because the point gets colored
because it's a bad point.",00:53:03.680,00:53:06.850
What is a bad point?,00:53:06.850,00:53:08.190
"The frequency on the sample, that is
patently on the sample, deviates",00:53:08.190,00:53:12.810
from E_out.,00:53:12.810,00:53:14.850
"Oh, E_out involves the
entire hypothesis.",00:53:14.850,00:53:17.340
"If I have the gray sheet and the
holes, I cannot compute E out.",00:53:17.340,00:53:21.110
"I have to peel it off, look, and get
the areas in order to get E out.",00:53:21.110,00:53:26.290
"So the argument is great, as long as you
can tell me how do I go around",00:53:26.290,00:53:31.850
the presence of E_out?,00:53:31.850,00:53:33.720
"And that's the second
part of the proof.",00:53:33.720,00:53:35.450
 ,00:53:35.450,00:53:39.090
What to do about E_out.,00:53:39.090,00:53:41.300
The simplest argument possible.,00:53:41.300,00:53:44.300
"That is really the breakthrough
that Vapnik and",00:53:44.300,00:53:46.570
Chervonenkis did.,00:53:46.570,00:53:48.840
"Back to the bin, just because it's
an illustration of the binary case.",00:53:48.840,00:53:51.960
"So here, we have one hypothesis.",00:53:51.960,00:53:54.940
"And we have E out, which is the
overall, in the entire space--",00:53:54.940,00:53:59.800
the error in the entire space.,00:53:59.800,00:54:01.910
"We pick a sample, and then we get E_in,
which is the value for the error",00:54:01.910,00:54:06.600
on this one.,00:54:06.600,00:54:07.170
So we have seen this before.,00:54:07.170,00:54:08.730
"And we said this tracks this, according
to the Hoeffding inequality.",00:54:08.730,00:54:12.780
"And the problem is that when you have
many, many bins, some of these guys",00:54:12.780,00:54:16.320
"will start deviating from E_out, to the
level if you pick according to the",00:54:16.320,00:54:19.750
"sample, you are no longer sure that
you picked the right one, because the",00:54:19.750,00:54:22.660
deviation could be big.,00:54:22.660,00:54:23.720
That was the argument.,00:54:23.720,00:54:25.240
"Now, I want to get rid of E_out.",00:54:25.240,00:54:27.172
The way I am going to do it is this.,00:54:27.172,00:54:29.180
 ,00:54:29.180,00:54:31.810
"Instead of picking one sample, I
am going to pick two samples,",00:54:31.810,00:54:38.020
independently.,00:54:38.020,00:54:40.010
"So obviously, they are not
identical samples.",00:54:40.010,00:54:41.630
"Some of them are green
or red, et cetera.",00:54:41.630,00:54:43.140
"But they are coming from
the same distribution.",00:54:43.140,00:54:45.660
"Now, let's see what is going on.",00:54:45.660,00:54:48.860
"E_out and E_in track each other, because
E_in is generated from this",00:54:48.860,00:54:53.150
distribution.,00:54:53.150,00:54:55.580
"Now, let's say I look at these two
samples and give them names.",00:54:55.580,00:55:00.340
"I am going to call them
E_in and E_in dash.",00:55:00.340,00:55:04.240
They're both in-sample.,00:55:04.240,00:55:05.340
It happens to be a different sample.,00:55:05.340,00:55:06.150
So I have two samples.,00:55:06.150,00:55:07.620
"I am going to call this E_in,
and this E_in dash.",00:55:07.620,00:55:11.320
"My question is, does E_in track
E_in dash, if you have one bin?",00:55:11.320,00:55:19.750
"Well, each of them tracks
E_out, right?",00:55:19.750,00:55:23.820
Because it was generated by it.,00:55:23.820,00:55:25.440
"So consequently, they
track each other.",00:55:25.440,00:55:28.750
"A bit more loosely, because
you have now two ways of",00:55:28.750,00:55:32.390
getting the sample error.,00:55:32.390,00:55:34.310
"On the other hand, if I do
two presidential polls--",00:55:34.310,00:55:38.550
one polling asks 3000 people.,00:55:38.550,00:55:41.470
Another asks 3000 people.,00:55:41.470,00:55:43.310
These are different 3000 people.,00:55:43.310,00:55:45.250
"You fully expect that the result will
be close to each other, right?",00:55:45.250,00:55:50.350
So these guys track each other.,00:55:50.350,00:55:52.990
"OK, fine.",00:55:52.990,00:55:54.490
What is the advantage?,00:55:54.490,00:55:55.280
The advantage is the following.,00:55:55.280,00:55:57.220
"If I now have multiple bins, the
problem I had here is reflected",00:55:57.220,00:56:03.010
exactly in the new tracking.,00:56:03.010,00:56:06.170
"When I had multiple bins, the tie
between E_out and E_in became looser",00:56:06.170,00:56:11.040
and looser.,00:56:11.040,00:56:11.890
"Because I'm looking for worst case, and
I might be unlucky enough, that the",00:56:11.890,00:56:16.490
"tracking now lost the tightness that one
bin with Hoeffding would dictate.",00:56:16.490,00:56:24.340
"If I am doing multiple bins, and not
looking at the bin at all, just",00:56:24.340,00:56:27.870
"looking at the two samples from each
bin, they track each other, but they",00:56:27.870,00:56:32.890
"also get loosely apart
as I go for more.",00:56:32.890,00:56:37.470
"Let's say, I tell you this experiment.",00:56:37.470,00:56:40.540
You pick two samples.,00:56:40.540,00:56:42.280
"They are close in terms of
the fraction of red.",00:56:42.280,00:56:45.550
"If you keep repeating it, can you get
one sample to be mostly red, and the",00:56:45.550,00:56:49.650
other sample to be mostly green?,00:56:49.650,00:56:51.700
Yeah.,00:56:51.700,00:56:52.110
"If you are patient enough,
it will happen.",00:56:52.110,00:56:53.950
"Exactly for the same reason,
because you keep looking",00:56:53.950,00:56:56.410
for it until it happens.,00:56:56.410,00:56:58.360
"So the mathematical ramifications of
multiple hypotheses happen here,",00:56:58.360,00:57:03.660
exactly the same way they happen here.,00:57:03.660,00:57:06.710
"The finesse now is that, if I
characterize it using the two",00:57:06.710,00:57:10.250
"samples, then I am completely
in the realm of dichotomies.",00:57:10.250,00:57:15.860
"Because now I'm not appealing
to E_out at all.",00:57:15.860,00:57:17.840
"I am only appealing to what
happens in a sample.",00:57:17.840,00:57:20.280
It's a bigger sample.,00:57:20.280,00:57:21.850
"I have 2N marbles now instead of N.
But still, I can define a growth",00:57:21.850,00:57:27.030
function on them.,00:57:27.030,00:57:28.200
"And now the characterization is
full, and I am ready to go.",00:57:28.200,00:57:31.600
"These are the only two components
you need to worry about as",00:57:31.600,00:57:34.240
you read the proof.,00:57:34.240,00:57:36.550
"Now, let's put it together.",00:57:36.550,00:57:39.610
 ,00:57:39.610,00:57:42.270
This is what we wanted.,00:57:42.270,00:57:43.670
This is not true.,00:57:43.670,00:57:44.650
Don't hold this against me.,00:57:44.650,00:57:45.900
"And to make sure, this is
not quite what we have.",00:57:45.900,00:57:49.340
"This would be direct substitution of the
plain-vanilla growth function in",00:57:49.340,00:57:53.530
terms of M.,00:57:53.530,00:57:56.500
"We are not going to have that, but we
are going instead to have this.",00:57:56.500,00:58:03.850
Lets look and compare.,00:58:03.850,00:58:05.100
 ,00:58:05.100,00:58:08.450
"These look the same, except
that this 2 became 4.",00:58:08.450,00:58:12.210
Is this good or bad?,00:58:12.210,00:58:13.790
"Well, it's bad.",00:58:13.790,00:58:14.650
We want this probability to be small.,00:58:14.650,00:58:16.430
"Bad, but not fatal.",00:58:16.430,00:58:17.680
 ,00:58:17.680,00:58:19.930
This one goes to here.,00:58:19.930,00:58:21.850
I have twice the sample.,00:58:21.850,00:58:22.810
You know why I have 2 now.,00:58:22.810,00:58:24.710
"Because now I use the bigger sample
for the argument, so I need 2N.",00:58:24.710,00:58:29.275
"Oh, but all of this was about
a polynomial and now I don't know",00:58:29.275,00:58:32.550
whether this will be a polynomial.,00:58:32.550,00:58:33.590
"Yes, you do.",00:58:33.590,00:58:34.970
"If it's polynomial in N, it's
polynomial in N here.",00:58:34.970,00:58:37.850
"Because you get 2N to the
k, then you get 2 to the k.",00:58:37.850,00:58:40.630
That's a constant.,00:58:40.630,00:58:42.130
And you still get N to the k.,00:58:42.130,00:58:44.250
So that remains a polynomial.,00:58:44.250,00:58:45.910
A bigger polynomial.,00:58:45.910,00:58:47.130
"I don't like it, but you
don't have to like it.",00:58:47.130,00:58:49.780
"It just has to be true, and
do the job we want.",00:58:49.780,00:58:53.230
"And finally, you can see this is minus
2, which was a very helpful factor.",00:58:53.230,00:58:56.380
This is in the exponent.,00:58:56.380,00:58:57.960
"2 in the exponent goes
a lot of mileage.",00:58:57.960,00:59:01.170
"And now we knock it down
all the way to 1/8.",00:59:01.170,00:59:03.830
"That's really, really bad news.",00:59:03.830,00:59:06.400
"The reason this is happening
is that, as we go through the",00:59:06.400,00:59:08.840
"technicalities of the proof, the epsilon
will become epsilon over 2.",00:59:08.840,00:59:13.340
"And then will become epsilon over 4, just
to take care of different steps.",00:59:13.340,00:59:17.310
"And when you plug in epsilon over 4
here, you get epsilon squared over 16.",00:59:17.310,00:59:20.480
And so you get a factor of 1/8.,00:59:20.480,00:59:22.200
That's the reason for it.,00:59:22.200,00:59:24.320
So this is what we will end up with.,00:59:24.320,00:59:26.140
"And you can be finicky and try to
improve this constant a lot, but the",00:59:26.140,00:59:29.530
"basic message is that here is
a statement that holds true for any",00:59:29.530,00:59:35.020
hypothesis set that has a break point.,00:59:35.020,00:59:37.210
"And this fellow is polynomial in N,
with the order of the polynomial",00:59:37.210,00:59:44.020
decided by the break point.,00:59:44.020,00:59:45.370
"And you will eventually learn, because
if N is big enough-- if I give you",00:59:45.370,00:59:49.460
"enough examples-- using that hypothesis,
you will be able to claim that E_in",00:59:49.460,00:59:53.435
tracks E_out correctly.,00:59:53.435,00:59:56.610
"This result, which is called the
Vapnik-Chervonenkis inequality, is the",00:59:56.610,01:00:01.560
"most important theoretical result
in machine learning.",01:00:01.560,01:00:06.120
"On that happy note, we will stop
here and take questions",01:00:06.120,01:00:09.730
after a short break.,01:00:09.730,01:00:10.980
 ,01:00:10.980,01:00:19.140
Let's start the Q&amp;A.,01:00:19.140,01:00:22.730
"MODERATOR: First, a few
clarifications from the beginning.",01:00:22.730,01:00:29.260
 ,01:00:29.260,01:00:29.270
"In slide 5, when you choose the N points,
does it mean your data set is",01:00:29.270,01:00:40.450
"of N points, or you just chose
N points from the data set?",01:00:40.450,01:00:44.710
"PROFESSOR: When I apply this to an actual
hypothesis set in an input space, then",01:00:44.710,01:00:50.170
 ,01:00:50.170,01:00:50.180
"these actually correspond
to a particular set of",01:00:50.180,01:00:52.730
points in that space.,01:00:52.730,01:00:54.970
"However, in the abstraction that just
defines the function B, these are just",01:00:54.970,01:01:00.810
abstract labels.,01:01:00.810,01:01:02.290
"These are labels for which
column I'm talking about.",01:01:02.290,01:01:06.220
"So although I call them x_1 up to
x_N-1, these are not really--",01:01:06.220,01:01:11.740
"in the abstraction here, they don't
correspond to any particular input",01:01:11.740,01:01:14.380

"But when they do, they will
correspond to a sample.",01:01:15.050,01:01:17.910
"And I am supposed to pick the sample
in that space that maximizes the",01:01:17.910,01:01:21.490
"number of dichotomies, et cetera, as
we defined the growth function.",01:01:21.490,01:01:25.200
"But it's a sample that I pick when I
apply this to a particular input space",01:01:25.200,01:01:29.340
and a hypothesis set.,01:01:29.340,01:01:30.590
 ,01:01:30.590,01:01:32.900
"MODERATOR: Also, there are
some people asking--",01:01:32.900,01:01:36.850
 ,01:01:36.850,01:01:36.860
"they didn't understand exactly why
alpha was different to beta.",01:01:36.860,01:01:40.590
"PROFESSOR: alpha
is different from beta?",01:01:40.590,01:01:41.900
MODERATOR: Yeah. Why?,01:01:41.900,01:01:42.655
 ,01:01:42.655,01:01:42.660
"PROFESSOR: Well, the short
answer is that I never made the",01:01:42.660,01:01:47.480
"statement that alpha is
different from beta.",01:01:47.480,01:01:49.530
"I just didn't bother ascertain any
relationship between alpha and beta.",01:01:49.530,01:01:54.170
I just called them names.,01:01:54.170,01:01:55.380
"If they happen to be
equal, I am happy.",01:01:55.380,01:01:56.790
"If they happen to be
unequal, I am happy.",01:01:56.790,01:01:58.660
"So all I'm doing here is just calling
the guys that happen to have a single",01:01:58.660,01:02:02.670
"extension, the number of
them, calling it alpha.",01:02:02.670,01:02:05.740
"Calling the guys that happen to
have double extension beta.",01:02:05.740,01:02:10.190
"I don't know whether alpha is bigger
than beta, or smaller than beta, in any",01:02:10.190,01:02:13.010
particular case.,01:02:13.010,01:02:14.060
"And it doesn't matter as far as
the analysis is concerned.",01:02:14.060,01:02:16.830
"If I call them this way, then it will
always be true that the total number",01:02:16.830,01:02:20.110
"of rows here is alpha plus beta plus
beta, which is alpha plus twice beta.",01:02:20.110,01:02:24.730
"So there is really no assertion about
the relative value of alpha and beta.",01:02:24.730,01:02:29.890
"MODERATOR: Moving on to the case
where you show the break points, and",01:02:29.890,01:02:35.040
how it satisfies the bound.,01:02:35.040,01:02:36.910
What happens if k equals infinity?,01:02:36.910,01:02:39.930
"No break points, basically.",01:02:39.930,01:02:44.010
"PROFESSOR: This is for the
positive rays and whatnot?",01:02:44.010,01:02:47.000
MODERATOR: Yeah.,01:02:47.000,01:02:47.560
"So for example, if you
had the convex sets.",01:02:47.560,01:02:50.966
"PROFESSOR: k equals infinity
means there is no break point.",01:02:50.966,01:02:53.770
"In that case, you don't have to bother
with any of the analysis I did.",01:02:53.770,01:02:57.090
No break points means what?,01:02:57.090,01:02:58.890
"Means the growth function is
2 to the N for every N, right? We",01:02:58.890,01:03:02.790
just computed it exactly.,01:03:02.790,01:03:04.780
"If you want a bound for it, yes,
it's bounded by 2 to the N. Not",01:03:04.780,01:03:07.710
a polynomial.,01:03:07.710,01:03:09.130
"So all of these cases, we're addressing
the case where there is",01:03:09.130,01:03:11.820
"a break point, because that is the case
where I can guarantee a polynomial.",01:03:11.820,01:03:15.860
"And therefore, I can
guarantee learning.",01:03:15.860,01:03:18.150
That is the interesting case.,01:03:18.150,01:03:19.300
"If there is no break point, this
theoretical line of analysis will not",01:03:19.300,01:03:23.770
guarantee learning.,01:03:23.770,01:03:25.300
"So if I have a hypothesis set that
happens to be able to shatter every",01:03:25.300,01:03:28.810
"set of points, I cannot make a statement
using this line of analysis",01:03:28.810,01:03:33.610
that it will learn.,01:03:33.610,01:03:34.790
"And one example we had
was convex sets.",01:03:34.790,01:03:37.270
"So convex sets have a growth function
of 2 to the N. Well, it really is",01:03:37.270,01:03:41.250
"a very pessimistic estimate here, because
the points have to be really, really",01:03:41.250,01:03:44.930
very funny.,01:03:44.930,01:03:45.280
"You have to build the pathological case,
in order not to be able to learn.",01:03:45.280,01:03:48.350
"And in many cases, you might be.",01:03:48.350,01:03:50.530
"But again, if I want a uniform statement
based only on the break",01:03:50.530,01:03:54.820
"point, this is the most I can say
using this line of analysis.",01:03:54.820,01:03:58.420
 ,01:03:58.420,01:04:04.050
MODERATOR: OK.,01:04:04.050,01:04:06.450
Just a quick review.,01:04:06.450,01:04:09.020
How is the break point calculated?,01:04:09.020,01:04:11.710
PROFESSOR: Calculated.,01:04:11.710,01:04:12.530
"The break point is-- this is the only
time you actually need to visit the",01:04:12.530,01:04:15.940
input space and the hypothesis set.,01:04:15.940,01:04:18.400
"You basically-- you are sitting in
a room with your hypothesis set.",01:04:18.400,01:04:22.630
"Someone gave you a problem
for credit approval.",01:04:22.630,01:04:24.980
"You decided to use perceptrons, and
you decided to use a nonlinear",01:04:24.980,01:04:29.110
transformation.,01:04:29.110,01:04:29.930
"And you do all of that, and you
start programming it.",01:04:29.930,01:04:32.230
"And you would like to know some
prediction of the generalization",01:04:32.230,01:04:35.630
performance that you are going to get.,01:04:35.630,01:04:38.160
"So you go into the room, and ask yourself:
for this hypothesis set, over",01:04:38.160,01:04:41.040
"this input space,",01:04:41.040,01:04:41.800
what is the break point?,01:04:41.800,01:04:43.290
"So now you have to actually go and
study your hypothesis set.",01:04:43.290,01:04:47.310
"And then find out that using this
hypothesis set, I cannot separate,",01:04:47.310,01:04:50.720
"let's say, 10 points in
every possible way.",01:04:50.720,01:04:52.860
"Very much along the argument we used for
the perceptron in two dimensions.",01:04:52.860,01:04:56.030
"We found out that we cannot separate
four points in every possible way.",01:04:56.030,01:05:00.800
"But the good news is that, you don't have
to do it anew, because for most of",01:05:00.800,01:05:04.650
"the famous learning models, this
has already been done.",01:05:04.650,01:05:08.370
"For the perceptrons, we will
get an exact break point.",01:05:08.370,01:05:11.960
For any-dimensional perceptron.,01:05:11.960,01:05:14.050
"So 20-dimensional perceptron,
here's the break point, and",01:05:14.050,01:05:16.590
here's the growth function.,01:05:16.590,01:05:17.680
"Or, here's the bound.",01:05:17.680,01:05:19.270
"Similarity from neural networks,
there is a break point.",01:05:19.270,01:05:22.150
"Not exact estimate of the break point,
but a bound on the break point.",01:05:22.150,01:05:25.460
"And again, in most of these cases,
bounds work, because we are always",01:05:25.460,01:05:28.850
trying to bound above.,01:05:28.850,01:05:30.440
"And we have room to play with, because
a polynomial is a polynomial",01:05:30.440,01:05:34.730
is a polynomial.,01:05:34.730,01:05:35.810
"So if you become a little bit sloppy
and forget something, and the break",01:05:35.810,01:05:40.530
point-- you say 10 instead of 7--,01:05:40.530,01:05:42.370
"it's not going to break the back of
learning versus non-learning.",01:05:42.370,01:05:45.380
"It's just going to tell you more
pessimistically, how much resources do",01:05:45.380,01:05:49.830
you need in order to learn?,01:05:49.830,01:05:51.180
"Which is more benign damage
than deciding, oh, I",01:05:51.180,01:05:54.825
cannot learn at all.,01:05:54.825,01:05:57.460
MODERATOR: OK.,01:05:57.460,01:05:58.710
 ,01:05:58.710,01:06:00.790
"Can you come up with an example, where
these bounds are not tight as here?",01:06:00.790,01:06:06.910
"PROFESSOR: There's one case,
which I could have covered but I",01:06:06.910,01:06:09.430
"didn't, where you take positive
and negative rays.",01:06:09.430,01:06:13.860
"So positive rays, you
take the real line.",01:06:13.860,01:06:16.160
"And from a point on it's +1.
Before, it's -1.",01:06:16.160,01:06:19.510
"Positive and negative rays, it means you
are also allowed to take rays that",01:06:19.510,01:06:23.640
"return +1 first, and
then -1 later.",01:06:23.640,01:06:26.900
"And the union of them is the model
called positive and negative rays.",01:06:26.900,01:06:30.550
It's a good exercise to do.,01:06:30.550,01:06:31.740
"Take that home and try to find,
what is the break point?",01:06:31.740,01:06:34.270
"And you'll find that although the break
point for positive rays is 2,",01:06:34.270,01:06:37.100
"in this case the break
point is actually 3.",01:06:37.100,01:06:39.290
"And the reason is that for two points,
now you can get everything because you",01:06:39.290,01:06:43.257
know the ray can be here.,01:06:43.257,01:06:44.620
So they are both minus.,01:06:44.620,01:06:46.030
The ray could be here.,01:06:46.030,01:06:47.030
They are both plus.,01:06:47.030,01:06:48.080
The ray could be here.,01:06:48.080,01:06:49.040
It's minus plus.,01:06:49.040,01:06:50.280
"But now, use the negative ray
to get the +1, -1.",01:06:50.280,01:06:53.750
So now you can shatter two points.,01:06:53.750,01:06:55.640
"And you would fail only for the three
points, when the middle guy is",01:06:55.640,01:06:58.000
"different, because you cannot
get it this way.",01:06:58.000,01:07:00.330
"So you will get-- and the
break point is 3.",01:07:00.330,01:07:02.060
"When you do the break point of
3, you will get the bound,",01:07:02.060,01:07:04.390
the blue bound here.,01:07:04.390,01:07:05.450
You will get that to be squared.,01:07:05.450,01:07:06.720
"Pretty much like here, because we have
a break point that corresponds",01:07:06.720,01:07:09.370
directly to squared.,01:07:09.370,01:07:10.340
"I don't care whether the 3 is coming
from positive intervals, or coming from",01:07:10.340,01:07:13.520
positive and negative rays.,01:07:13.520,01:07:15.190
It's 3.,01:07:15.190,01:07:15.470
"Therefore, the blue bound
is quadratic.",01:07:15.470,01:07:17.690
"If you compute the number of dichotomies
you can get, which is the",01:07:17.690,01:07:22.370
"growth function, it will
actually be linear.",01:07:22.370,01:07:24.620
"So there will be a discrepancy between
linear for the exact estimate of the",01:07:24.620,01:07:27.730
"growth function, to quadratic
of the bound.",01:07:27.730,01:07:30.320
"So there are cases that
you can come up with, easily.",01:07:30.320,01:07:31.520
"And as a matter of fact, this
is the exception on this,",01:07:31.520,01:07:34.450
rather than the rule.,01:07:34.450,01:07:35.330
"In most of the cases, there
will be a slack.",01:07:35.330,01:07:37.140
 ,01:07:37.140,01:07:39.770
"MODERATOR: And this question drives
the point of the whole lecture.",01:07:39.770,01:07:43.710
 ,01:07:43.710,01:07:43.720
"It says, we have been focusing on
having E_in equal to E_out, or close",01:07:43.720,01:07:49.555
"to E_out, not in the
actual value of E_in.",01:07:49.555,01:07:54.720
"So using our hypotheses, there are just
as many percentage errors in the",01:07:54.720,01:07:58.300
training data as the real data.,01:07:58.300,01:07:59.850
Why is that?,01:07:59.850,01:08:02.090
"PROFESSOR: This goes back to
separating the question of learning",01:08:02.090,01:08:04.880
into the two questions.,01:08:04.880,01:08:06.620
"There was one question which
was addressed now.",01:08:06.620,01:08:08.820
"We are trying to get E_in
to track E_out.",01:08:08.820,01:08:11.850
Why do I need that?,01:08:11.850,01:08:13.160
"Because I don't know E_out, and
I will not know E_out.",01:08:13.160,01:08:16.700
"That is simply an unknown
quantity for me.",01:08:16.700,01:08:19.270
"And I want to work with
something to minimize.",01:08:19.270,01:08:21.260
"I cannot minimize something
that I don't know.",01:08:21.260,01:08:23.520
"So if the theoretical guarantees tell me
that E_in is a proxy for E_out, and",01:08:23.520,01:08:28.340
"if I minimize E_in, E_out
will follow suit.",01:08:28.340,01:08:30.800
"Then I can now work with a quantity
that I know, and do it.",01:08:30.800,01:08:33.700
"That's the first part, that
they are tracking each other.",01:08:33.700,01:08:35.939
The second part is the practical.,01:08:35.939,01:08:37.220
"Now, I am going to go and
try to minimize E_in.",01:08:37.220,01:08:40.569
This is the second part of it.,01:08:40.569,01:08:45.140
"MODERATOR: Also, they're asking if--",01:08:45.140,01:08:46.800
"can you clarify more, why
is the VC dimension useful?",01:08:46.800,01:08:52.220

as of now, is an unknown quantity.",01:08:52.220,01:08:54.630

digesting the lecture.,01:09:21.450,01:09:22.500

"As I mentioned before, if you didn't
follow this in real time, don't be",01:09:23.609,01:09:27.300
discouraged.,01:09:27.300,01:09:27.750
It's actually very sweet material.,01:09:27.750,01:09:30.000
And you can look at the lecture again.,01:09:30.000,01:09:31.830
And you can read the proof.,01:09:31.830,01:09:33.210
"And you can do all of the homework,
until it settles in your mind.",01:09:33.210,01:09:37.640
"This is the most abstract, or the
most theoretical, lecture",01:09:37.640,01:09:40.410
of the entire course.,01:09:40.410,01:09:41.600

"good shape as far as the
rest of the course.",01:09:44.200,01:09:45.740

be more friendly mathematics.",01:09:45.740,01:09:49.510
"Friendly, as in less abstract.",01:09:49.510,01:09:50.910
"For someone who is not theoretically
inclined, the more abstract the",01:09:50.910,01:09:55.760
"mathematics is, the less they
can follow it, because they",01:09:55.760,01:09:58.370
cannot relate to it.,01:09:58.370,01:09:59.380
So this one has the abstraction.,01:09:59.380,01:10:01.110

much easier to relate to.",01:10:01.110,01:10:04.380

what I'm trying to do, to",01:10:19.800,01:10:24.320
what has already happened.,01:10:24.320,01:10:25.370
"There used to be M in place
of the growth function.",01:10:25.370,01:10:28.660
So the growth function is here.,01:10:28.660,01:10:32.170
"There used to be M. So the easiest
way for me to describe what is",01:10:32.170,01:10:35.400
"happening with the theory, is to tell
you that you are going to take",01:10:35.400,01:10:37.770
"M out, and replace it with this.",01:10:37.770,01:10:40.000
"As usual, it's not that easy.",01:10:40.000,01:10:42.120
"Even remember with the Hoeffding,
when I complained about the 2",01:10:42.120,01:10:44.360
here and the 2 here?,01:10:44.360,01:10:45.840
"Well, you have to have them, in order
for the statement to be true.",01:10:45.840,01:10:48.490
"So for the statement to be true, we
needed to do some technical stuff that",01:10:48.490,01:10:51.870
"really didn't change the essence of
the statement here, but made it",01:10:51.870,01:10:56.420
"a little bit different by changing
the constants.",01:10:56.420,01:10:58.660
"And therefore, we have a proof
for it. It holds.",01:10:58.660,01:11:00.980
And it captures the essence of that.,01:11:00.980,01:11:03.080
"I just didn't want to bother telling you
this because, if I told you this in",01:11:03.080,01:11:06.180
"the first place, you would have
been completely lost.",01:11:06.180,01:11:08.210
Why 4?,01:11:08.210,01:11:08.830
Why 2?,01:11:08.830,01:11:09.240
What is this 1/8?,01:11:09.240,01:11:10.620
And forget about the essence.,01:11:10.620,01:11:12.370
"So the easiest way to do it,
we are replacing it.",01:11:12.370,01:11:14.370
"This is not the final form,
but we are replacing it.",01:11:14.370,01:11:16.490
"Until you get the idea: indeed,
I can replace it.",01:11:16.490,01:11:19.010
"But oh, in order to replace it,
I need to have a bigger sample",01:11:19.010,01:11:21.770
that we argued for.,01:11:21.770,01:11:22.520
So I need 2N.,01:11:22.520,01:11:23.660
"Oh, and now the bigger samples are not
tracking to each other as well as each",01:11:23.660,01:11:27.570
"of them is tracking the actual
out-of-sample error.",01:11:27.570,01:11:30.900
"So I need to modify these
values, and so on.",01:11:30.900,01:11:33.490
So it becomes much easier to swallow.,01:11:33.490,01:11:35.400
"The technicalities will come in, in order
to make the proof go through.",01:11:35.400,01:11:39.230
MODERATOR: OK.,01:11:39.230,01:11:40.700
"Can you review the definition
of B of N and k?",01:11:40.700,01:11:43.804
PROFESSOR: B of N and k.,01:11:43.804,01:11:48.070
"Assume you have N points, and assume
that k is a break point.",01:11:48.070,01:11:52.270
"So you're assured that no
k points will have all",01:11:52.270,01:11:55.400
possible patterns on them.,01:11:55.400,01:11:58.630
"After these two assumptions, make
no further assumptions.",01:11:58.630,01:12:01.490
You don't know where this came from.,01:12:01.490,01:12:03.010
"You don't know what space
you are working with.",01:12:03.010,01:12:04.560
"You don't know what the
hypothesis set is.",01:12:04.560,01:12:06.610
"You just know that in your setup,
when you get N points--",01:12:06.610,01:12:10.910
that is the N here--,01:12:10.910,01:12:11.830
"and the break point is
k-- that is k here.",01:12:11.830,01:12:14.590
"Under those conditions, can you
bound the growth function?",01:12:14.590,01:12:18.420
"Can you tell me that the growth
function can never",01:12:18.420,01:12:20.320
be bigger than something?,01:12:20.320,01:12:22.410
"That something is what I am
calling B of N and k.",01:12:22.410,01:12:25.850
So what am I doing?,01:12:25.850,01:12:26.660
"I'm taking the minimal conditions
you gave me.",01:12:26.660,01:12:28.600
"I have N points, and k
is a break point.",01:12:28.600,01:12:30.540
"And asking myself: what is the maximum
number of dichotomies you can possibly",01:12:30.540,01:12:34.820
"have, under no other constraints,
in order to satisfy these two",01:12:34.820,01:12:38.580
constraints?,01:12:38.580,01:12:39.390
And I'm calling this B of N and k.,01:12:39.390,01:12:41.620
Why did I do it?,01:12:41.620,01:12:42.460
"First, it's going to help, being an upper
bound for any hypothesis set",01:12:42.460,01:12:46.660
"that has a break point k, because
it is the maximum.",01:12:46.660,01:12:49.660
"The second one, it's a purely
combinatorial quantity.",01:12:49.660,01:12:53.140
"So I have a much better chance of
analyzing it, without going through the",01:12:53.140,01:12:56.920
"hairy details of input spaces, and
correlation between events, and so on.",01:12:56.920,01:13:01.260
"And that is indeed, what ended
up being the case.",01:13:01.260,01:13:03.770
"We had a very simple recursion on it,
and we found a formula for it.",01:13:03.770,01:13:06.880
"And that formula now serves as
an upper bound for the more hairy",01:13:06.880,01:13:09.820
"quantity, which is the growth function
that is very particular to a learning",01:13:09.820,01:13:13.320
"situation, an input space,
and a hypothesis set.",01:13:13.320,01:13:16.310
"MODERATOR: Also, a particular question
on the proof of B of N and k, the recursion.",01:13:16.310,01:13:20.010
 ,01:13:20.010,01:13:20.020
Slide 5.,01:13:20.020,01:13:21.270
 ,01:13:21.270,01:13:24.880
"The question is, why does k not
change when going back from",01:13:24.880,01:13:29.990
N to N minus 1?,01:13:29.990,01:13:32.750
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:13:32.750,01:13:34.000
 ,01:13:34.000,01:13:35.640
"Here, if you look at x_1, x_2, up to
x_N, the disappearing x_N here, no k",01:13:35.640,01:13:43.400
"columns can have all
possible patterns.",01:13:43.400,01:13:46.290
"These k columns could involve the last
column, and could involve only the",01:13:46.290,01:13:51.210
first N minus 1 columns.,01:13:51.210,01:13:52.960
"Just no k columns whatsoever can
have all possible patterns.",01:13:52.960,01:13:57.270
"So when I look at the reduced one, N
minus 1, I know for a fact that no k",01:13:57.270,01:14:02.040
"columns of these guys can have
all possible patterns.",01:14:02.040,01:14:05.520
"Because that would qualify as
k columns of the bigger one.",01:14:05.520,01:14:09.170
So k doesn't really change.,01:14:09.170,01:14:11.930
"The only time I had a different k
is when I had a nice argument",01:14:11.930,01:14:17.010
"that, if you have k minus 1 points which
have all possible patterns on",01:14:17.010,01:14:22.150
"the smaller set, then adding the
last column will get us in",01:14:22.150,01:14:25.500
trouble with k columns.,01:14:25.500,01:14:28.270
"So for that, I needed an argument.",01:14:28.270,01:14:30.790
"But in general, when I take the
statement on face value, k is fixed.",01:14:30.790,01:14:34.220
And the k columns could be anything.,01:14:34.220,01:14:35.660
"Could be involving the last column, or
could be restricted to the first guy.",01:14:35.660,01:14:39.180
"Could be the first k columns,
for all I care.",01:14:39.180,01:14:40.960
 ,01:14:40.960,01:14:44.350
"MODERATOR: How does this formalization
apply to, say, a regression problem?",01:14:44.350,01:14:50.200
 ,01:14:50.200,01:14:50.210
"PROFESSOR: Again, this
is all binary functions.",01:14:50.210,01:14:52.390
"So the classification of
+1 and -1.",01:14:52.390,01:14:54.960
"And as I mentioned, the entire analysis,
the VC analysis, can be",01:14:54.960,01:14:58.400
extended to real-valued functions.,01:14:58.400,01:15:00.140
"It's a very technical extension that, in
my humble opinion, does not add to",01:15:00.140,01:15:04.560
the insight.,01:15:04.560,01:15:05.620
"And therefore, instead of doing that and
going very technical, in order to",01:15:05.620,01:15:10.020
"gain very little in terms of the
insight, I decided that when I get to",01:15:10.020,01:15:14.530
"regression functions, I am going to
apply a completely different approach,",01:15:14.530,01:15:17.660
which is the bias-variance tradeoff.,01:15:17.660,01:15:19.490
"It will give us another insight into
the situation, and will tackle",01:15:19.490,01:15:22.800
"the real-valued functions directly,
the regression functions.",01:15:22.800,01:15:25.460
"And therefore, I think we'll have both
the benefit of having another way of",01:15:25.460,01:15:28.000
"looking at it, and covering
both types of functions.",01:15:28.000,01:15:32.170
"MODERATOR: There's this person that
says, I feel silly asking this, but is",01:15:32.170,01:15:36.060
"the bottom line that we can prove
learnability if the learning model",01:15:36.060,01:15:39.320
cannot learn everything?,01:15:39.320,01:15:42.140
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:15:42.140,01:15:44.410
"We proved learnability under a condition
about the hypothesis set.",01:15:44.410,01:15:49.120
"When you say learning everything,
you are really talking",01:15:49.120,01:15:51.930
about the target function.,01:15:51.930,01:15:54.250
So the target function is unknown.,01:15:54.250,01:15:56.080
"What I am telling you here is that, if
you tell me that there is a break",01:15:56.080,01:15:59.540
"point, I can tell you that if you have
enough examples, E_in will be close to",01:15:59.540,01:16:04.460
"E_out for the hypothesis you pick,
whichever way you pick it.",01:16:04.460,01:16:09.610
"It remains to be seen whether you are
going to be able to minimize E_in, to",01:16:09.610,01:16:14.550
a level that will make you happy.,01:16:14.550,01:16:16.080
"I will never know that until
you start minimizing.",01:16:16.080,01:16:18.740
"So if the target function happens to be
extremely difficult, or completely",01:16:18.740,01:16:22.300
"random-- unlearnable, you are not
going to see this in the",01:16:22.300,01:16:25.000
generalization question.,01:16:25.000,01:16:26.380
"The generalization question is
independent of the target function.",01:16:26.380,01:16:29.520
I didn't bring it up here at all.,01:16:29.520,01:16:31.060
"It has to do with the
hypothesis set only.",01:16:31.060,01:16:34.240
"The target function will come in--
if I get E_in to be small, E_out",01:16:34.240,01:16:38.590
will be small.,01:16:38.590,01:16:39.090
"I know that from the generalization
argument that I made.",01:16:39.090,01:16:41.650
Can I get E_in to be small?,01:16:41.650,01:16:43.460
"If the target function is random, you
will get a sample that that is",01:16:43.460,01:16:46.620
extremely difficult to fit.,01:16:46.620,01:16:48.480
"And you are not going to be able
to get E_in to be small.",01:16:48.480,01:16:51.320
"But at least, you will realize that
you could not learn, in",01:16:51.320,01:16:55.470
that particular case.,01:16:55.470,01:16:56.550
"And in another target function, you will
realize that you can learn, because",01:16:56.550,01:16:59.310
E_in went down.,01:16:59.310,01:17:01.000
"So the question of whether I can learn
or not, the generalization part of it",01:17:01.000,01:17:06.100
is independent of the target function.,01:17:06.100,01:17:08.770
"The second question is very much
dependent on the target function, but",01:17:08.770,01:17:12.470
"the good news is that it
happens in sample.",01:17:12.470,01:17:14.250
"I can observe it, and realize how
well, or not so well, I learned.",01:17:14.250,01:17:18.220
 ,01:17:18.220,01:17:21.000
"MODERATOR: Also, going back to a previous
question, does this also generalize",01:17:21.000,01:17:25.950
to multi-class problems?,01:17:25.950,01:17:27.200
 ,01:17:27.200,01:17:29.620
"PROFESSOR: Basically, there
is no restriction on the",01:17:29.620,01:17:31.540
inputs or the outputs.,01:17:31.540,01:17:32.680
There is a counterpart.,01:17:32.680,01:17:34.050
"And instead of saying break point,
what is a break point?",01:17:34.050,01:17:36.560
"And dichotomies, they are
not really dichotomies.",01:17:36.560,01:17:37.980
You have real values.,01:17:37.980,01:17:38.980
"You have no real values, so
there are technicalities to be done in",01:17:38.980,01:17:41.710
"order to be able to reduce
them to this case.",01:17:41.710,01:17:43.660
"But the same principle applies,
regardless of the type of",01:17:43.660,01:17:46.850
function you have.,01:17:46.850,01:17:49.120
MODERATOR: I think that's it.,01:17:49.120,01:17:50.090
