"The coefficients n-choose-k
that we calculated in the",00:00:00.000,00:00:04.320
"previous segment are known as
the binomial coefficients.",00:00:04.320,00:00:08.220
"They are intimately related
to certain probabilities",00:00:08.220,00:00:11.060
"associated with coin tossing
models, the so-called binomial",00:00:11.060,00:00:15.590
probabilities.,00:00:15.590,00:00:16.930
"This is going to
be our subject.",00:00:16.930,00:00:19.670
"We consider a coin which we
toss n times in a row,",00:00:19.670,00:00:25.540
independently.,00:00:25.540,00:00:28.190
"For each one of the tosses of
this coin, we assume that",00:00:28.190,00:00:31.840
"there is a certain probability,
p, that the",00:00:31.840,00:00:34.360
"result is heads, which of
course, implies that the",00:00:34.360,00:00:38.290
"probability of obtaining tails
in any particular toss is",00:00:38.290,00:00:42.340
going to be 1 minus p.,00:00:42.340,00:00:45.180
"The question we want to address
is the following.",00:00:45.180,00:00:49.740
"We want to calculate the
probability that in those n",00:00:49.740,00:00:53.400
"independent coin tosses,
we're going to",00:00:53.400,00:00:56.010
observe exactly k heads.,00:00:56.010,00:00:58.835
"Let us start working our way
towards the solution to this",00:01:02.060,00:01:05.980
"problem by looking first
at a simple setting",00:01:05.980,00:01:10.600
and then move on.,00:01:10.600,00:01:13.300
"So let us answer this
simple question.",00:01:13.300,00:01:16.600
"What is the probability
that we observe",00:01:16.600,00:01:19.530
this particular sequence?,00:01:19.530,00:01:21.940
"Of course here we take n equal
to six, and we wish to",00:01:21.940,00:01:26.780
calculate this probability.,00:01:26.780,00:01:29.020
"Now, because we have assumed
that the coin tosses are",00:01:29.020,00:01:32.200
"independent, we can multiply
probabilities.",00:01:32.200,00:01:35.250
"So the probability of this
sequence is equal to the",00:01:35.250,00:01:38.000
"probability that the first
toss is heads times the",00:01:38.000,00:01:42.690
"probability that the second
toss is tails, which is 1",00:01:42.690,00:01:45.850
"minus p, times the probability
that the third toss is tails,",00:01:45.850,00:01:49.860
"which is 1 minus p, times the
probability of heads, times",00:01:49.860,00:01:53.460
"the probability of
heads, times the",00:01:53.460,00:01:54.820
probability of heads.,00:01:54.820,00:01:56.289
"And by collecting terms, this is
p to the 4th times 1 minus",00:01:56.289,00:02:01.290
p to the second power.,00:02:01.290,00:02:02.620
"More generally, if I give you a
particular sequence of heads",00:02:05.880,00:02:11.840
"and tails, as in this example,
and I ask you, what is the",00:02:11.840,00:02:15.910
"probability that this particular
sequence is",00:02:15.910,00:02:18.710
"observed, then by generalizing
from this answer or from the",00:02:18.710,00:02:25.160
"derivation of this answer, you
see that you're going to get p",00:02:25.160,00:02:31.170
to the power number of heads.,00:02:31.170,00:02:33.615
"And the reason is that each
time that there's a head",00:02:36.120,00:02:39.940
"showing up in this sequence,
there's a corresponding factor",00:02:39.940,00:02:43.220
of p in this numerical answer.,00:02:43.220,00:02:46.570
"And then there are factors
associated with tails.",00:02:46.570,00:02:50.450
"Each tail contributes a
factor of 1 minus p.",00:02:50.450,00:02:54.050
"And so we're going to have
here 1 minus p to a power",00:02:54.050,00:02:57.980
equal to the number of tails.,00:02:57.980,00:02:59.910
"Now, if I ask you about the
probability of a particular",00:03:04.050,00:03:08.270
"sequence and that particular
sequence has happened to have",00:03:08.270,00:03:11.720
"exactly k heads, what is the
probability of that sequence?",00:03:11.720,00:03:15.400
"Well, we already calculated
what it is.",00:03:15.400,00:03:18.340
"It is the previous answer,
except we use the symbol k",00:03:18.340,00:03:22.920
"instead of just writing out
explicitly ""number of heads.""",00:03:22.920,00:03:27.560
"And the number of tails is the
number of tosses minus how",00:03:27.560,00:03:31.960
many tosses resulted in heads.,00:03:31.960,00:03:36.400
"Now, we're ready to consider
the actual problem that we",00:03:36.400,00:03:40.810
"want to solve, which
is calculate the",00:03:40.810,00:03:43.100
probability of k heads.,00:03:43.100,00:03:46.010
"The event of obtaining
k heads can happen in",00:03:46.010,00:03:50.270
many different ways.,00:03:50.270,00:03:52.490
"Any particular k-head sequence
makes that event to occur.",00:03:52.490,00:03:58.280
"Any particular k-head sequence
has a probability equal to",00:03:58.280,00:04:04.590
this expression.,00:04:04.590,00:04:06.840
"The overall probability of k
heads is going to be the",00:04:06.840,00:04:11.170
"probability of any particular
k-head sequence, times the",00:04:11.170,00:04:18.230
"number of k-head sequences
that we have.",00:04:18.230,00:04:22.170
"Now, the reason why we can carry
out this argument is the",00:04:27.490,00:04:31.800
"fact that any k-head sequence
has the same probability.",00:04:31.800,00:04:36.090
"Otherwise, we wouldn't be able
to write down an answer which",00:04:36.090,00:04:39.520
"is just the product
of two terms.",00:04:39.520,00:04:41.980
"But because every k-head
sequence has the same",00:04:41.980,00:04:44.600
"probability, to find the overall
probability, we take",00:04:44.600,00:04:47.860
"the probability of each one of
them and multiply it with the",00:04:47.860,00:04:52.050
"number of how many
of these we have.",00:04:52.050,00:04:55.360
"So to make further progress, now
we need to calculate the",00:04:55.360,00:05:00.110
"number of possible
k-head sequences.",00:05:00.110,00:05:03.550
How many are there?,00:05:03.550,00:05:05.920
"Well, specifying a k-head
sequence is",00:05:05.920,00:05:09.340
the same as the following.,00:05:09.340,00:05:11.160
"You think of having
n time slots.",00:05:11.160,00:05:14.580
"These time slots corresponds
to the different",00:05:14.580,00:05:17.590
tosses of your coin.,00:05:17.590,00:05:20.240
"And to specify a k-head
sequence, you need to tell me",00:05:20.240,00:05:24.410
"which ones of these slots happen
to contain a head.",00:05:24.410,00:05:31.610
"You need to tell me
k of those slots.",00:05:31.610,00:05:35.420
"So in other words, what you're
doing is you're specifying a",00:05:35.420,00:05:40.800
"subset of the set of
these n slots, a",00:05:40.800,00:05:45.460
subset that has k elements.,00:05:45.460,00:05:48.290
"You need to choose k of the
slots out of the n and tell me",00:05:48.290,00:05:53.070
that those k slots have heads.,00:05:53.070,00:05:55.630
"That's the way of specifying a
particular k-head sequence.",00:05:55.630,00:05:59.560
"So what's the number of
k-head sequences?",00:05:59.560,00:06:02.630
"Well, it's the same as the
number of ways that you can",00:06:02.630,00:06:05.760
"choose k slots out of the n
slots, which is our binomial",00:06:05.760,00:06:11.110
"coefficient, n-choose-k.",00:06:11.110,00:06:14.410
"Therefore, the answer to our
problem is this expression",00:06:14.410,00:06:18.420
"here, times n-choose-k, which
is shown up here.",00:06:18.420,00:06:25.590
"At this point, we can pause and
consider a simple question",00:06:25.590,00:06:30.080
"to check your understanding of
the binomial probabilities.",00:06:30.080,00:06:34.040
