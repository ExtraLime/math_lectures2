"We are going to start today in
a serious way on the",00:00:07.000,00:00:12.882
"inhomogenous equation,
second-order linear",00:00:12.882,00:00:17.705
"differential,
I'll simply write it out",00:00:17.705,00:00:22.058
"instead of writing out all the
words which go with it.",00:00:22.058,00:00:28.294
"So, such an equation looks
like, the second-order equation",00:00:28.294,00:00:35.000
"is going to look like y double
prime plus p of x,",00:00:35.000,00:00:40.647
"t, x plus q of x times y.
Now, up to now the right-hand",00:00:40.647,00:00:47.991
"side has been zero.
So, now we are going to make it",00:00:47.991,00:00:53.147
"not be zero.
So, this is going to be f of x.",00:00:53.147,00:00:57.479
In the most frequent,00:00:57.479,00:01:00.470
"applications,
x is time.",00:01:00.470,00:01:02.843
"x is usually time,
often, but not always.",00:01:02.843,00:01:08.000
"So, maybe just for today,
I will use X in talking about",00:01:08.000,00:01:13.030
"the general theory.
And, from now on,",00:01:13.030,00:01:16.383
"I'll probably make X equal time
because that's what is most of",00:01:16.383,00:01:22.065
"the time in the applications.
So, this is the part we've been",00:01:22.065,00:01:27.654
"studying up until now.
It has a lot of names.",00:01:27.654,00:01:31.753
"It's input, signal,
commas between those,",00:01:31.753,00:01:35.479
"a driving term,
or sometimes it's called the",00:01:35.479,00:01:39.484
"forcing term.
You'll see all of these in the",00:01:39.484,00:01:44.160
"literature, and it pretty much
depends upon what course you're",00:01:44.160,00:01:48.554
"sitting at, what the professor
habitually calls it.",00:01:48.554,00:01:52.155
"I will try to use all these
terms now and then,",00:01:52.155,00:01:55.468
"probably most often I will
lapse into input as the most",00:01:55.468,00:01:59.357
"generic term,
suggesting nothing in",00:01:59.357,00:02:01.806
"particular, and therefore,
equally acceptable or",00:02:01.806,00:02:05.191
"unacceptable to everybody.
The response,",00:02:05.191,00:02:09.651
"the solution,
then, the solution as you know",00:02:09.651,00:02:15.116
"is then called the response.
The response,",00:02:15.116,00:02:20.325
"sometimes it's called the
output.",00:02:20.325,00:02:24.392
"I think I'll stick pretty much
with response.",00:02:24.392,00:02:31.000
"So, I'm using pretty much the
same terminology we use for",00:02:31.000,00:02:35.894
"studying first-order equations.
Now, as you will see,",00:02:35.894,00:02:40.439
"the reason we had to study the
homogeneous case first was",00:02:40.439,00:02:45.333
"because you cannot solve this
without knowing the homogeneous",00:02:45.333,00:02:50.577
"solutions.
So, that's the inhomogeneous",00:02:50.577,00:02:53.898
"case.
But the homogeneous one,",00:02:53.898,00:02:56.432
"the corresponding homogeneous
thing, y double prime plus p of",00:02:56.432,00:03:01.676
"x y prime plus q of x times y
equals zero",00:03:01.676,00:03:06.745
"is an essential
part of the solution to this",00:03:06.745,00:03:11.640
"equation.
That's called,",00:03:11.640,00:03:15.304
"therefore, it has names.
Now, unfortunately,",00:03:15.304,00:03:19.311
"it doesn't have a single name.
I don't know what to call it,",00:03:19.311,00:03:24.810
"but I think I'll probably call
it the associated homogeneous",00:03:24.810,00:03:30.308
"equation, or ODE,
the associated homogeneous",00:03:30.308,00:03:34.315
"equation, the one associated to
the guy on the left.",00:03:34.315,00:03:40.000
"It's also called the reduced
equation by some people.",00:03:40.000,00:03:44.013
"There is some other term for
it, which escapes me totally,",00:03:44.013,00:03:48.412
"but what the heck.
Now, its solution has a name.",00:03:48.412,00:03:52.040
"So, its solution,
of course, doesn't depend on",00:03:52.040,00:03:55.513
"anything in particular,
the general solution,",00:03:55.513,00:03:58.909
"because the right-hand side is
always zero.",00:03:58.909,00:04:03.000
"So, its solution,
we know can be written as y",00:04:03.000,00:04:06.285
"equals in the form c1 y1 plus c2
y2,",00:04:06.285,00:04:10.093
"where y1 and y2 are any two
independent solutions of that,",00:04:10.093,00:04:14.349
"and then c1's and c2's are
arbitrary constants.",00:04:14.349,00:04:17.783
"Now, what you are looking at
this equation,",00:04:17.783,00:04:20.920
"you're going to need this also.
And therefore,",00:04:20.920,00:04:24.279
"it has a name.
It has various names.",00:04:24.279,00:04:26.893
"Sometimes there is a subscript,
c, there.",00:04:26.893,00:04:31.000
"Sometimes there's a subscript,
h.",00:04:31.000,00:04:34.139
"Sometimes there's no subscript
at all, which is the most",00:04:34.139,00:04:39.534
"confusing of all.
But, anyway,",00:04:39.534,00:04:42.379
"what's the name given to it?
Well, there is no name.",00:04:42.379,00:04:47.382
"Many books call it the solution
to the associated homogeneous",00:04:47.382,00:04:53.268
"equation.
That's maximally long.",00:04:53.268,00:04:56.310
"Your book calls it the
complementary solution.",00:04:56.310,00:05:02.000
"Many people call it that,
and many will look at you with",00:05:02.000,00:05:06.282
"a blank, who know differential
equations very well,",00:05:06.282,00:05:10.176
"and will not have the faintest
idea what you're talking about.",00:05:10.176,00:05:14.926
"If you call it (y)h,
then you are thinking of it as",00:05:14.926,00:05:18.819
"the solution;
the h is for homogeneous to",00:05:18.819,00:05:21.934
"indicate it's the solution.
So, it's the solution to the,",00:05:21.934,00:05:26.295
"I'm not going to write that.
You put it in her books if you",00:05:26.295,00:05:30.811
"like writing.
Write solution to the",00:05:30.811,00:05:33.459
"associated homogeneous equation,
y(h).",00:05:33.459,00:05:36.340
"But, it's all the same thing.
Now, or the solution to the",00:05:36.340,00:05:41.981
"reduced equation,
I see I have in my notes.",00:05:41.981,00:05:45.064
"Okay, good, the solution to the
reduced equation,",00:05:45.064,00:05:48.587
"too.
Okay, now, the examples,",00:05:48.587,00:05:50.642
"there are, of course,
two classical examples,",00:05:50.642,00:05:53.871
"of which you know one.
But, use them as the model for",00:05:53.871,00:05:57.688
"what solutions of these things
should look like and how they",00:05:57.688,00:06:02.018
"should behave.
So, the model you know already",00:06:02.018,00:06:06.500
"is the one, I won't make the
leading coefficient one because",00:06:06.500,00:06:11.416
"it usually isn't,
is the one, m x double prime,",00:06:11.416,00:06:15.166
"so t is the
independent variable,",00:06:15.166,00:06:18.750
"plus b x prime plus k x equals
f of t.",00:06:18.750,00:06:23.416
"That's the spring-mass system,",00:06:23.416,00:06:26.500
"the spring-mass-dashpot system.
Mass, the damping constant and",00:06:26.500,00:06:32.550
"the spring constant,
except up to now,",00:06:32.550,00:06:35.694
"it's always been zero here.
What does this f of t",00:06:35.694,00:06:40.540
"represent?
Well, if you think of the way",00:06:40.540,00:06:43.855
"in which I derived the equation,
the mx, that was the Newton's",00:06:43.855,00:06:49.040
"law.
That's the acceleration.",00:06:49.040,00:06:51.420
"So, it's the acceleration,
the mass times the",00:06:51.420,00:06:55.160
"acceleration.
By Newton's law,",00:06:55.160,00:06:57.625
"this is equal to the imposed
force on the little mass truck.",00:06:57.625,00:07:04.000
"Okay, you got that truck,
there.",00:07:04.000,00:07:06.214
"I'm not going to draw the truck
for the nth time.",00:07:06.214,00:07:09.642
"You'll have to imagine it.
So, here's our truck.",00:07:09.642,00:07:13.000
"Okay, forces are acting on it.
Remember, the forces were ",00:07:13.000,00:07:17.357
"minus kx.
That came from the spring.",00:07:17.357,00:07:20.000
"There was a force,
minus b x prime.",00:07:20.000,00:07:23.071
"That came from the dashpot,
the damping force.",00:07:23.071,00:07:26.285
"So, this other guy is f of t.",00:07:26.285,00:07:30.000
"What's this?
This is the external force,",00:07:30.000,00:07:32.489
"which is acting out.
In other words,",00:07:32.489,00:07:34.723
"instead of the little truck
going back and forth and doing",00:07:34.723,00:07:38.361
"its own thing all by itself,
here's someone with an",00:07:38.361,00:07:41.553
"electromagnet,
and the mass it's carrying is a",00:07:41.553,00:07:44.425
"big pile of iron ore.
You're turning it on and off,",00:07:44.425,00:07:47.617
"and pulling that thing from
afar where nobody can see it.",00:07:47.617,00:07:51.191
"So, this is the external force.
Now, think, that is the model",00:07:51.191,00:07:55.021
"you must have in your mind of
how these equations are treated.",00:07:55.021,00:08:00.000
"In other words,
when f of t is zero,",00:08:00.000,00:08:03.204
"the system is passive.
There is no external force on",00:08:03.204,00:08:07.377
"it when this is zero.
The system is sitting,",00:08:07.377,00:08:10.581
"and just doing what it wants to
do, all by itself.",00:08:10.581,00:08:14.233
"You wanted up by giving it an
initial push,",00:08:14.233,00:08:17.362
"and putting its initial
position somewhere.",00:08:17.362,00:08:20.492
"But after that,
you lay your hands off.",00:08:20.492,00:08:23.324
"The system then just passively
responds to its initial",00:08:23.324,00:08:27.274
"conditions and does what it
wants.",00:08:27.274,00:08:31.000
"The other model is that you
don't let it respond the way it",00:08:31.000,00:08:35.205
"wants to.
You force it from the outside",00:08:35.205,00:08:37.960
"by pushing it with an external
force.",00:08:37.960,00:08:40.570
"Now, those are clearly two
entirely different problems:",00:08:40.570,00:08:44.485
"what it does by itself,
or what it does when it's acted",00:08:44.485,00:08:48.399
"on from outside.
And, when I explained to you",00:08:48.399,00:08:51.590
"how the thing is to be solved,
you have to keep in mind those",00:08:51.590,00:08:55.940
"two models.
So, this is the forced system.",00:08:55.940,00:09:00.000
"I'll just use the word,
forced system,",00:09:00.000,00:09:02.967
"that's where f of t is
not zero, versus the passive",00:09:02.967,00:09:07.699
"system where there is no
external applied force.",00:09:07.699,00:09:11.468
"The passive system,
the forced system,",00:09:11.468,00:09:14.436
"now, you have to both,
even if you wanted to solve the",00:09:14.436,00:09:18.686
"forced system,
the way the system would behave",00:09:18.686,00:09:22.295
"if nothing would be done to it
from the outside is nonetheless",00:09:22.295,00:09:27.187
"going to be an important part of
the solution.",00:09:27.187,00:09:32.000
"And, I won't be able to give
you that solution without",00:09:32.000,00:09:35.700
"knowing this also.
Now, I'd like to give you the",00:09:35.700,00:09:38.981
"other model very rapidly because
it's in your book.",00:09:38.981,00:09:42.472
"It's in the problems I have to
give you.",00:09:42.472,00:09:45.195
"You know, it's part of
everybody's culture,",00:09:45.195,00:09:48.128
"whether they like it or not.
So, that's example number one.",00:09:48.128,00:09:52.177
"Example number two,
which follows the differential",00:09:52.177,00:09:55.599
"equation just as perfectly as
the spring-mass-dashpot system",00:09:55.599,00:09:59.718
"is the simple electric circuit.
The inductance,",00:09:59.718,00:10:04.367
"you don't know yet what an
inductance is,",00:10:04.367,00:10:08.013
"officially, but you will,
a resistance,",00:10:08.013,00:10:11.477
"sorry, that's okay,
put the capacitance up there,",00:10:11.477,00:10:15.852
"resistance, and then maybe a
thing.",00:10:15.852,00:10:18.951
"So, this is a resistance.
I think you know these symbols.",00:10:18.951,00:10:24.056
"By now, you certainly know the
system for capacitance.",00:10:24.056,00:10:28.887
"What I mean when I say C is the
capacitance, you may not know",00:10:28.887,00:10:34.356
"yet what L is.
That's called the inductance.",00:10:34.356,00:10:39.100
"So, this is something called a
coil because it looks like one.",00:10:39.100,00:10:43.518
"L is what's called its
inductance.",00:10:43.518,00:10:45.908
"And, the differential equation,
there are two differential",00:10:45.908,00:10:50.037
"equations which can be used in
this.",00:10:50.037,00:10:52.572
"They are essentially the same.
One is simply the derivative of",00:10:52.572,00:10:56.990
"the other.
Both differential equations",00:10:56.990,00:10:59.670
"come from Kirchhoff's voltage
law, that the sum of the voltage",00:10:59.670,00:11:04.088
"drops as you move around the
circuit --",00:11:04.088,00:11:08.000
"-- has to be zero because
otherwise, I don't have to,",00:11:08.000,00:11:11.596
"that's because of somebody's
law, Kirchhoff,",00:11:11.596,00:11:14.570
"with two h's.
The sum of the voltage drops to",00:11:14.570,00:11:17.613
"zero, and now you know the
voltage drop across this,",00:11:17.613,00:11:21.141
"and you know the voltage drop
across that because you learned",00:11:21.141,00:11:25.291
"in 8.02.
You will, one day,",00:11:25.291,00:11:27.089
"learn the voltage drop across
this.",00:11:27.089,00:11:29.440
"But, I already know it.
It's Li.",00:11:29.440,00:11:32.828
"So, i is the current.
I'll write this thing in its",00:11:32.828,00:11:37.902
"primitive form first.
So, i is the current that's",00:11:37.902,00:11:42.872
"flowing in the circuit.
q is the charge on the",00:11:42.872,00:11:47.532
"capacitance.
So, the voltage drop across the",00:11:47.532,00:11:51.985
"coil is L times i.
The voltage shop across the,",00:11:51.985,00:11:57.473
"Li prime,
the voltage drop across the",00:11:57.473,00:12:02.029
"resistance is,
well, you know that.",00:12:02.029,00:12:07.000
"And, the voltage shop across
the capacitance is q ",00:12:07.000,00:12:10.885
"divided by C.
And so, that's equal to,",00:12:10.885,00:12:13.124
"well, it's equal to zero,
except if there's a battery",00:12:13.124,00:12:16.548
"here or something generating a
voltage drop,",00:12:16.548,00:12:19.380
"so, let's call that E is a
generic word.",00:12:19.380,00:12:21.948
"E could be a battery.
It could be a source of",00:12:21.948,00:12:24.846
"alternating current,
something like that.",00:12:24.846,00:12:27.480
"But, there's a voltage drop
across it, and I'm giving E the",00:12:27.480,00:12:31.299
"name of the voltage drop.
So, and then there's the",00:12:31.299,00:12:35.566
"question of the signs,
which I know I'll never",00:12:35.566,00:12:38.503
"understand.
But, let's assume you've chosen",00:12:38.503,00:12:41.244
"the sign convention so that this
comes out nicely on the",00:12:41.244,00:12:44.834
"right-hand side.
So, this might be varying",00:12:44.834,00:12:47.510
"sinusoidally,
in which case you'd have source",00:12:47.510,00:12:50.382
"of alternating current.
Or, it might be constant,",00:12:50.382,00:12:53.515
"in which that would be a
battery, a little dry cell",00:12:53.515,00:12:56.778
"giving you direct current of a
constant voltage,",00:12:56.778,00:12:59.846
"stuff like that.
So, you could make this minus",00:12:59.846,00:13:03.808
"if you want, but everything will
have the wrong signs,",00:13:03.808,00:13:07.114
"so don't do it.
Now, this doesn't look like",00:13:07.114,00:13:09.734
"what it's supposed to look like
because it's got q and i.",00:13:09.734,00:13:13.227
"So, the final thing you have to
know is that q prime is ",00:13:13.227,00:13:17.156
"equal to i.
The rate at which that charge",00:13:17.156,00:13:19.776
"leaves the condenser and hurries
around the circuit to find its",00:13:19.776,00:13:23.643
"little soul mate on the other
side is the current that's",00:13:23.643,00:13:27.074
"flowing in the circuit.
That's why current flows,",00:13:27.074,00:13:30.068
"except nothing really happens.
Electrons just push on each",00:13:30.068,00:13:35.131
"other, and they stay where they
are.",00:13:35.131,00:13:37.894
"I don't understand this at all.
So, if I differentiate this,",00:13:37.894,00:13:42.552
"you can do two things.
Either you could integrate i,",00:13:42.552,00:13:46.578
"and expressed the thing
entirely in terms of q,",00:13:46.578,00:13:50.210
"or you can differentiate it,
and express everything in terms",00:13:50.210,00:13:54.868
"of i.
Your book does nicely both,",00:13:54.868,00:13:57.394
"does not take sides.
So, let's differentiate it,",00:13:57.394,00:14:02.021
"and then it will look like L i
double prime plus R i prime plus",00:14:02.021,00:14:06.664
"i divided by C equals,",00:14:06.664,00:14:09.809
"and now, watch out,
you have now not the",00:14:09.809,00:14:12.729
"electromotive force,
but its derivative.",00:14:12.729,00:14:15.649
"So, if you were so unfortunate
as to put a little dry cell",00:14:15.649,00:14:19.917
"there, now you've got nothing,
and you've got the homogeneous",00:14:19.917,00:14:24.410
"case.
That's okay.",00:14:24.410,00:14:25.683
"Where are the erasers?
One eraser?",00:14:25.683,00:14:28.154
I don't believe this.,00:14:28.154,00:14:31.000
"So, there's the equation.
There are our two equations.",00:14:43.000,00:14:47.116
"Why don't we put them up in
colored chalk.",00:14:47.116,00:14:50.300
"There's the spring equation.
And, here's the equation that",00:14:50.300,00:14:54.728
"governs the current,
for how the current flows in",00:14:54.728,00:14:58.456
"that circuit.
And now, you can see,",00:14:58.456,00:15:01.097
"again, what does it mean?
If this is zero,",00:15:01.097,00:15:04.281
"for example,
if I have a dry cell there,",00:15:04.281,00:15:07.310
"or if I have nothing at all in
the circuit, then this",00:15:07.310,00:15:11.349
"represents the passive circuit.
It's just sitting there.",00:15:11.349,00:15:16.465
"It wouldn't do anything at all,
except that you've put a charge",00:15:16.465,00:15:20.250
"on the capacitor,
and waited, and of course,",00:15:20.250,00:15:22.875
"when you put a charge on there,
it's got a discharge,",00:15:22.875,00:15:26.049
"and discharges through the
circuit, and swings back and",00:15:26.049,00:15:29.345
"forth a little bit if it's
under-damped until finally",00:15:29.345,00:15:32.520
"towards the end the current dies
away to zero.",00:15:32.520,00:15:36.000
"But, what usually happens is
that you drive this passive",00:15:36.000,00:15:39.940
"circuit by putting an effective
E in it, and then you want to",00:15:39.940,00:15:44.238
"know how the current behaves.
So, those are the two problems,",00:15:44.238,00:15:48.537
"the passive circuit without an
applied electromotive force,",00:15:48.537,00:15:52.692
"or plugging it into the wall,
and wanting it to do things.",00:15:52.692,00:15:56.776
"That's the normal state of
affairs.",00:15:56.776,00:16:00.000
"People don't want passive
circuits, they want circuits",00:16:00.000,00:16:03.975
"which do things because,
okay, that's why they want to",00:16:03.975,00:16:07.950
"solve inhomogeneous equations
instead of homogeneous",00:16:07.950,00:16:11.774
"equations.
But as I said,",00:16:11.774,00:16:13.575
"you have to do the homogeneous
case first.",00:16:13.575,00:16:16.649
"Okay, you are now officially
responsible for this,",00:16:16.649,00:16:20.325
"and I don't care that you
haven't had it in physics yet.",00:16:20.325,00:16:24.450
"You will before the next exam.
So, I don't even feel guilty.",00:16:24.450,00:16:30.000
"But, you're going to start
using it on the problem set",00:16:30.000,00:16:34.303
"right away.
So, it's never too soon to",00:16:34.303,00:16:37.307
"start learning it.
Okay, now, the main theorem,",00:16:37.307,00:16:41.042
"I now want to go,
so that was just examples to",00:16:41.042,00:16:44.696
"give you some physical feeling
for the sorts of differential",00:16:44.696,00:16:49.487
"equations we'll be talking
about.",00:16:49.487,00:16:52.085
"I now want to tell you briefly
about the key theorem about",00:16:52.085,00:16:56.713
"solving the homogeneous
equation.",00:16:56.713,00:16:59.311
"So, the main theorem about
solving the homogeneous equation",00:16:59.311,00:17:04.021
"is, the inhomogeneous equation.
So, I'm going to write the",00:17:04.021,00:17:09.993
"inhomogeneous equation out.
I'm going to make the left-hand",00:17:09.993,00:17:14.440
"side a linear operator,
and am going to write the",00:17:14.440,00:17:18.121
equation as Ly equals f of x.,00:17:18.121,00:17:21.341
"That's the inhomogeneous
equation.",00:17:21.341,00:17:23.872
"So, L is the linear operator,
second order because I'm only",00:17:23.872,00:17:28.319
"talking about second-order
equations.",00:17:28.319,00:17:32.000
"L is a linear operator,
and then this is the",00:17:32.000,00:17:37.262
"differential equation.
So, here's our differential",00:17:37.262,00:17:43.259
"equation.
It's inhomogeneous because it's",00:17:43.259,00:17:48.155
"go the f of x on the
right hand side.",00:17:48.155,00:17:53.662
"And, what the theorem says is
that the solution has the",00:17:53.662,00:18:00.271
"following form,
y sub p, I'll explain what that",00:18:00.271,00:18:05.901
"is in just a moment,
plus y sub c.",00:18:05.901,00:18:13.000
"So, the hypothesis is we've got
the linear equation,",00:18:13.000,00:18:17.155
"and the conclusion is that
that's what its solution looks",00:18:17.155,00:18:21.718
"like.
Now, you already know what y",00:18:21.718,00:18:24.407
"sub c looks like.
In other words,",00:18:24.407,00:18:27.014
"if I write this out in more
detail, it would be i.e.,",00:18:27.014,00:18:31.251
"department of fuller
explanation, --",00:18:31.251,00:18:35.000
"-- the general solution looks
like y equals yp,",00:18:35.000,00:18:38.763
"and then this thing is going to
look like an arbitrary constant",00:18:38.763,00:18:43.836
"times y1 plus an arbitrary
constant times y2,",00:18:43.836,00:18:47.436
"where these are solutions of
the homogeneous equation.",00:18:47.436,00:18:51.772
"So, Yc looks like this part,
and the yp, what's yp?",00:18:51.772,00:18:55.863
"p stands for particular,
the most confusing word in this",00:18:55.863,00:19:00.363
"subject.
But, you've got at least four",00:19:00.363,00:19:04.974
"weeks to learn what it means.
Okay, yp is a particular",00:19:04.974,00:19:10.410
solution to Ly equals f of x.,00:19:10.410,00:19:14.717
"Now, I'm not going to explain
what particular means.",00:19:14.717,00:19:19.948
"First, I'll chat as if you knew
what it meant,",00:19:19.948,00:19:24.564
"and then we'll see if you have
picked it up.",00:19:24.564,00:19:30.000
"In other words,
the procedure for solving this",00:19:30.000,00:19:33.824
"equation is composed of two
steps.",00:19:33.824,00:19:36.628
"First, to find this part.
In other words,",00:19:36.628,00:19:40.028
"to find the complementary
solution, in other words,",00:19:40.028,00:19:44.277
"to do what we've been doing for
the last week,",00:19:44.277,00:19:48.101
"solve not the equation you are
given, but the reduced equation.",00:19:48.101,00:19:53.371
"So, the first step is to find
this.",00:19:53.371,00:19:56.260
"The second step is to find yp.
Now, what's yp?",00:19:56.260,00:20:01.301
"yp is a particular solution to
the whole equation.",00:20:01.301,00:20:05.552
"Yeah, but which one?
Well, if it's any one,",00:20:05.552,00:20:09.196
"then it's not a particular
solution, yeah.",00:20:09.196,00:20:12.753
"I say, unfortunately the word
particular here is not being",00:20:12.753,00:20:17.698
"used in exactly the same sense
in which most people use it in",00:20:17.698,00:20:22.904
"ordinary English.
It's a perfectly valid way to",00:20:22.904,00:20:26.894
"use it.
It's just confusing,",00:20:26.894,00:20:29.237
"and no one has ever come up
with a better word.",00:20:29.237,00:20:33.228
"So, particular means any one
solution.",00:20:33.228,00:20:38.000
"Any one will do.
Okay, even these have slightly",00:20:38.000,00:20:45.131
"different meanings.
Any questions about this?",00:20:45.131,00:20:51.953
"I refuse to answer them.
[LAUGHTER]",00:20:51.953,00:20:58.000
"Now, well, examples of course
will make it all clear.",00:20:58.000,00:21:03.927
"But I'd like,
first, to prove the theorem,",00:21:03.927,00:21:08.601
"to show you how simple it is.
It's extremely simple if you",00:21:08.601,00:21:15.098
"just use the fact that L is a
linear operator.",00:21:15.098,00:21:20.227
"We've got two things to prove.
What have we got to prove?",00:21:20.227,00:21:26.611
"Well, I have to prove two
statements, first of all,",00:21:26.611,00:21:32.310
"that all the yp plus c1 y1 plus
c2 y2 are",00:21:32.310,00:21:39.264
"solutions.
How are we going to prove that?",00:21:39.264,00:21:43.817
"Well, how do you know if
something is a solution?",00:21:43.817,00:21:46.631
"Well, you plug it into the
equation, and you see if it",00:21:46.631,00:21:49.739
"satisfies the equation.
Good, let's do it,",00:21:49.739,00:21:52.143
"proof.
L, I'm going to plug it into",00:21:52.143,00:21:54.136
"the equation.
That means I calculate L of yp",00:21:54.136,00:21:56.657
plus c1 y1 plus c2 y2.,00:21:56.657,00:22:00.000
"Now, what's the answer?
Because this is a linear",00:22:00.000,00:22:04.321
"operator, and notice,
the argument doesn't use the",00:22:04.321,00:22:08.827
"fact that the equation is second
order.",00:22:08.827,00:22:12.321
"It immediately generalizes to a
linear equation of any order,",00:22:12.321,00:22:17.839
"whatever-- 47.
Okay, this is L of yp plus L of",00:22:17.839,00:22:21.977
c1 y1 plus c2 y2.,00:22:21.977,00:22:25.563
"Well, what's that?
What's L of the complementary",00:22:25.563,00:22:29.885
"solution?
What does it mean to be the",00:22:29.885,00:22:34.032
"complementary solution?
It means when you apply the",00:22:34.032,00:22:37.797
"operator L to it,
you get zero because this",00:22:37.797,00:22:40.960
"satisfies the homogeneous
equation.",00:22:40.960,00:22:43.519
"So, this is zero.
What's L of yp?",00:22:43.519,00:22:46.682
"Well, it was a particular
solution to the equation.",00:22:46.682,00:22:50.447
"Therefore, when I plugged it
into the equation,",00:22:50.447,00:22:53.910
"I must have gotten out on the
right-hand side,",00:22:53.910,00:22:57.298
"f of x.
So, this is since yp is a",00:22:57.298,00:23:00.385
"solution to the whole equation.
So, what's the conclusion?",00:23:00.385,00:23:06.017
"That, if I take any one of
these guys, no matter what c1",00:23:06.017,00:23:10.286
"and c2 are, apply the linear
operator, L to it,",00:23:10.286,00:23:13.856
"the answer comes out
to be f of.",00:23:13.856,00:23:17.116
"Therefore, this proves that
this shows that these are all",00:23:17.116,00:23:21.462
"solutions because that's what it
means.",00:23:21.462,00:23:24.411
"Therefore, they satisfy L of y
equals f of x.",00:23:24.411,00:23:30.000
"They satisfy the whole
inhomogeneous differential",00:23:30.000,00:23:34.189
"equation, and that's it.
Well, that's only half the",00:23:34.189,00:23:38.553
"story.
The other half of the story is",00:23:38.553,00:23:41.695
"to show that there are no other
solutions.",00:23:41.695,00:23:45.274
"Okay, so we got our little u of
x coming up again,",00:23:45.274,00:23:50.336
"and he thinks he's a solution.
Okay, so, to prove there are no",00:23:50.336,00:23:55.660
"other solutions,
it almost sounds biblical,",00:23:55.660,00:23:59.326
"thou shalt have no other
solutions before me,",00:23:59.326,00:24:03.167
"okay.
There are no other solutions",00:24:03.167,00:24:07.011
"accept these guys for different
values of c1 and c2.",00:24:07.011,00:24:10.676
"Okay, so, u of x is a
solution.",00:24:10.676,00:24:13.479
"I have to show that u of x is
one of these guys.",00:24:13.479,00:24:16.856
"How am I going to do that?
Easy.",00:24:16.856,00:24:19.083
"If it's a solution that,
L of u,",00:24:19.083,00:24:21.958
"okay, I'm going to drop the x,
okay, just to make the,",00:24:21.958,00:24:25.766
"like I dropped the x over
there.",00:24:25.766,00:24:29.000
"If it's a solution to the whole
inhomogeneous equation,",00:24:29.000,00:24:33.768
"then this must come out to be f
of x.",00:24:33.768,00:24:37.742
"Now, what's L of yp?
That's f of x too,",00:24:37.742,00:24:41.981
"by secret little particular
solution I've got in my pocket.",00:24:41.981,00:24:47.103
"Okay, I pull it out,
ah-ha, L of yp,",00:24:47.103,00:24:50.194
"that's f of x,
too.",00:24:50.194,00:24:51.784
"Now, I'm going to not add them.
I'm going to subtract them.",00:24:51.784,00:24:56.906
What is L of u minus yp?,00:24:56.906,00:25:00.174
"Well, it's zero.
It's zero because this is a",00:25:00.174,00:25:05.009
"linear operator.
This would be L of u minus L of",00:25:05.009,00:25:08.508
"yp.
I guess the answer is zero on",00:25:08.508,00:25:12.156
"the right-hand side.
And therefore,",00:25:12.156,00:25:14.687
"what is the conclusion?
If that's zero,",00:25:14.687,00:25:17.516
"it must be a solution to the
homogeneous equation.",00:25:17.516,00:25:21.163
"Therefore, u minus yp 
is equal to,",00:25:21.163,00:25:24.439
"there must be c1 and c2.
I won't give them the generic",00:25:24.439,00:25:28.384
"names.
I'll give them a name,",00:25:28.384,00:25:30.468
"a particular one.
I'll put a tilde to indicate",00:25:30.468,00:25:34.995
"it's a particular one.
c1 plus c2 y2 tilde,",00:25:34.995,00:25:37.987
"so, in other words,
for some choice of these",00:25:37.987,00:25:41.051
"constants, and I'll call those
particular choices c1 tilde and",00:25:41.051,00:25:45.398
"c2 tilde, it must be that these
are equal.",00:25:45.398,00:25:48.319
"Well, what does that say?
It says that u is equal to yp",00:25:48.319,00:25:52.167
"plus c1 tilde,
blah, blah, blah,",00:25:52.167,00:25:54.375
"blah, plus c2 tilde,
blah, blah, blah,",00:25:54.375,00:25:57.012
"blah, and therefore chose that
u wasn't a new solution.",00:25:57.012,00:26:02.000
"It was one of these.
So, u isn't new.",00:26:02.000,00:26:08.476
"So, I should write it down.
Otherwise some of you will have",00:26:08.476,00:26:18.910
"missed the punch line.
Okay, therefore,",00:26:18.910,00:26:25.746
"u is equal to yp plus c1 tilde
y1 plus c2 tilde y2.",00:26:25.746,00:26:36.000
"And, it shows.
This guy who thought he was new",00:26:36.000,00:26:39.441
"was not new at all.
It was just one of the other",00:26:39.441,00:26:43.036
"solutions.
Okay, well, now,",00:26:43.036,00:26:45.025
"since the coefficient's a
constant, apparently we've done",00:26:45.025,00:26:49.308
"half the work.
We know what the complementary",00:26:49.308,00:26:52.674
"solution is because you know how
to do those in terms of",00:26:52.674,00:26:56.881
"exponentials and complex
exponentials,",00:26:56.881,00:26:59.711
"signs and cosines,
and so on.",00:26:59.711,00:27:03.000
"So, what's left to do?
All we have to do is find to",00:27:03.000,00:27:07.285
"solve equations,
which are inhomogeneous.",00:27:07.285,00:27:10.714
"All we have to do is find a
particular solution,",00:27:10.714,00:27:14.742
"find one solution.
It doesn't matter which one,",00:27:14.742,00:27:18.685
"any one.
Just find one,",00:27:18.685,00:27:20.571
"okay?
Now, we're going to spend the",00:27:20.571,00:27:23.485
"next two weeks trying to do
this.",00:27:23.485,00:27:26.228
"I'll give you various methods.
I'll give you a general method",00:27:26.228,00:27:32.352
"involving Fourier series because
it's a good excuse for learning",00:27:32.352,00:27:37.294
"what Fourier series are.
But, the answer is that in",00:27:37.294,00:27:41.215
"general, for a few standard
functions, it's known how to do",00:27:41.215,00:27:45.764
"this.
You will learn those methods",00:27:45.764,00:27:48.352
"for finding those using
operators.",00:27:48.352,00:27:50.941
"For all the others,
it's done by a series,",00:27:50.941,00:27:54.156
"or a method involving
approximation.",00:27:54.156,00:27:58.000
"Or, the worse comes to worst,
you throw it on a computer and",00:27:58.000,00:28:02.916
"just take a graph and the
numerical output of answers as",00:28:02.916,00:28:07.500
"the particular solution.
Okay, now before,",00:28:07.500,00:28:10.916
"we are going to start that
work, not today.",00:28:10.916,00:28:14.416
"We'll start it next Monday,
and it will last,",00:28:14.416,00:28:18.083
"as I say the next two weeks.
And, we will be up to spring",00:28:18.083,00:28:22.750
"break.
But, before we do that,",00:28:22.750,00:28:25.166
"I'd like to relate this to what
we did for first order equations",00:28:25.166,00:28:30.416
"because there is something to be
learned from that.",00:28:30.416,00:28:36.000
"Think back to the linear
first-order equation,",00:28:36.000,00:28:38.840
"and I'm going to,
since from now on for the rest",00:28:38.840,00:28:41.808
"of the period,
I'm going to be considering the",00:28:41.808,00:28:44.648
"case for constant coefficients.
In other words,",00:28:44.648,00:28:47.553
"this case of springs or
circuits or simple systems which",00:28:47.553,00:28:51.025
"behave like those and have
constant coefficients.",00:28:51.025,00:28:54.055
"So, for the linear,
first-order equation,",00:28:54.055,00:28:56.580
"there, too, I'm going to think
of constant coefficients.",00:28:56.580,00:29:01.000
"We talked quite a bit about
this equation.",00:29:01.000,00:29:04.000
"What did I call the right-hand
side?",00:29:04.000,00:29:06.560
"I think we usually called it q
of t,",00:29:06.560,00:29:09.780
"right?
This is in ancient history.",00:29:09.780,00:29:12.195
"The definition of ancient
history was before the first",00:29:12.195,00:29:16.073
"exam.
Okay, now how does that fit",00:29:16.073,00:29:18.414
"into this theorem that I've
given you?",00:29:18.414,00:29:21.121
"Remember what the solution
looked like.",00:29:21.121,00:29:25.000
"The solution looked like,
remember, you took the",00:29:25.000,00:29:28.962
"integrating factor was e to the
kt,",00:29:28.962,00:29:32.756
"and then after you integrated
both sides, multiplied through,",00:29:32.756,00:29:37.815
"and then the final answer
looked like this,",00:29:37.815,00:29:41.356
"y equaled, it was e to the
negative kt times",00:29:41.356,00:29:45.994
"either an indefinite integral,
or a definite integral",00:29:45.994,00:29:50.378
"depending on your preference,
q of t,",00:29:50.378,00:29:54.172
"so, x is metamorphosed into t.
I gather you've got that,",00:29:54.172,00:29:58.809
"e to the kt plus,
what was the other term?",00:29:58.809,00:30:02.266
"A constant times e to the
negative kt",00:30:02.266,00:30:08.000
"How does this fit into the
paradigm I've given you over",00:30:08.000,00:30:12.258
"there for solving the second
order equation?",00:30:12.258,00:30:15.648
"Which term is which?
Well, this has the arbitrary",00:30:15.648,00:30:19.433
"constant in it.
So, this must be the",00:30:19.433,00:30:22.193
"complementary solution.
Is it?",00:30:22.193,00:30:24.480
"Is this the solution to the
associated homogeneous equation?",00:30:24.480,00:30:30.000
"What's the associated
homogeneous equation?",00:30:30.000,00:30:32.698
"Put zero here.
Okay, if you put zero there,",00:30:32.698,00:30:35.396
"what's the solution?
Now, this you ought to know.",00:30:35.396,00:30:38.479
y prime equals negative ky.,00:30:38.479,00:30:40.985
"What's the solution?
e to the negative kt.",00:30:40.985,00:30:43.554
You are supposed to come into,00:30:43.554,00:30:46.188
"this course knowing that,
except there's an arbitrary",00:30:46.188,00:30:49.528
"constant in front.
So, right, this is exactly the",00:30:49.528,00:30:52.612
"solution to the associated
homogeneous equation,",00:30:52.612,00:30:55.631
"where there is zero here.
Then, what's this thing?",00:30:55.631,00:31:00.000
"This is a particular solution.
This is my yp.",00:31:00.000,00:31:02.743
"But that's not a particular
solution because this indefinite",00:31:02.743,00:31:06.423
"integral, you know,
has an arbitrary constant in",00:31:06.423,00:31:09.354
"it.
In fact, it's just that",00:31:09.354,00:31:10.975
"arbitrary constant.
So, it's totally confusing.",00:31:10.975,00:31:13.844
"But, this symbol,
you know when you actually",00:31:13.844,00:31:16.525
"solve the equation this way,
all you did was you found one",00:31:16.525,00:31:20.080
"function here.
You didn't throw in the",00:31:20.080,00:31:22.387
"arbitrary constant right away.
All you needed to do was find",00:31:22.387,00:31:26.066
"one function.
And, even if you really are",00:31:26.066,00:31:29.788
"bothered by the fact that this
is so indefinite,",00:31:29.788,00:31:32.900
"and therefore,
make it a particular solution",00:31:32.900,00:31:35.748
"by making this zero,
make it a definite integral,",00:31:35.748,00:31:38.927
"zero, here, t there,
and then change those t's to",00:31:38.927,00:31:42.105
"dummy t's, t1's or t tildes,
or something like that.",00:31:42.105,00:31:45.483
"So, this fits into that thing.
In other words,",00:31:45.483,00:31:48.463
"I could have done it at that
time, but I didn't the point",00:31:48.463,00:31:52.172
"because this can be solved
directly, whereas,",00:31:52.172,00:31:55.086
"of course, the general second
order equation in homogeneous",00:31:55.086,00:31:58.927
"cannot be solved directly,
and therefore you have to be",00:31:58.927,00:32:02.503
"willing to talk about what its
solutions look like in advance.",00:32:02.503,00:32:08.000
"Now, remember I said,
we talked, I said there was two",00:32:08.000,00:32:12.071
"different cases,
although both of them had the",00:32:12.071,00:32:15.594
"identical looking solution.
Their meaning in the physical",00:32:15.594,00:32:19.978
"world was so different that they
really should be considered as",00:32:19.978,00:32:24.832
"solving the same equation.
And, one of these was the case.",00:32:24.832,00:32:30.000
"Of the two, perhaps the more
important was the case when k",00:32:30.000,00:32:34.692
"was positive,
and of course the other is when",00:32:34.692,00:32:38.314
"k is negative.
When k is positive,",00:32:38.314,00:32:41.031
"that had the effect of
separating that solution into",00:32:41.031,00:32:45.230
"this part, which was a
transient, and the other part,",00:32:45.230,00:32:49.510
"which was a steady state.
The steady state solution,",00:32:49.510,00:32:53.709
"that was the yp part of it in
that terminology.",00:32:53.709,00:32:57.496
"And, the transient part,
it was trangent because it went",00:32:57.496,00:33:02.024
"to zero.
If k is positive,",00:33:02.024,00:33:05.558
"the exponential dies regardless
of what c is.",00:33:05.558,00:33:09.593
"So, the transient,
that's the yc part.",00:33:09.593,00:33:12.985
"It goes to zero as Ttgoes to
infinity.",00:33:12.985,00:33:16.378
"The transient depends on,
uses, the initial condition,",00:33:16.378,00:33:21.237
"whatever it is,
because that's what determines",00:33:21.237,00:33:25.363
"the value of c.
On the other hand,",00:33:25.363,00:33:28.389
"this initial condition makes no
difference as t goes towards",00:33:28.389,00:33:33.799
"infinity.
All that's left is this steady",00:33:33.799,00:33:38.788
"state solution.
And, all solutions tend to the",00:33:38.788,00:33:42.971
"steady state solution.
So, if k is positive,",00:33:42.971,00:33:46.967
"one gets this analysis of the
solutions into the sum of one",00:33:46.967,00:33:52.358
"basic solution,
and the others,",00:33:52.358,00:33:55.147
"which just die away,
have no influence on this,",00:33:55.147,00:33:59.423
"less and less influence as time
goes to infinity.",00:33:59.423,00:34:05.000
"For k less than zero,
this analysis does not work",00:34:05.000,00:34:09.160
"because this term,
if k is less than zero,",00:34:09.160,00:34:12.715
"this term goes to infinity or
negative infinity,",00:34:12.715,00:34:16.789
"and typically tends to dominate
that.",00:34:16.789,00:34:19.910
"So, it's the start that the
important one.",00:34:19.910,00:34:23.464
"It depends on the initial
conditions, and the analysis is",00:34:23.464,00:34:28.318
"meaningless.
So, the above is meaningless.",00:34:28.318,00:34:33.000
"And now, what I'd like to do is
try to see what the analog of",00:34:33.000,00:34:39.570
"that is for second order
equations, and higher order",00:34:39.570,00:34:45.155
"equations.
If you understand second-order,",00:34:45.155,00:34:49.645
"that's good enough.
Higher order goes exactly the",00:34:49.645,00:34:54.902
"same way.
So, the question is,",00:34:54.902,00:34:58.077
"for second-order,
let's make it with constant",00:34:58.077,00:35:02.896
"coefficients plus,
I could call it b and k,",00:35:02.896,00:35:07.495
"oh, no, b k,
or p.",00:35:07.495,00:35:11.000
"The trouble is,
that wouldn't take care of the",00:35:11.000,00:35:14.292
"electrical circuits.
So, I just want to use neutral",00:35:14.292,00:35:17.951
"letters, which suggest nothing.
And, you can make them turn it",00:35:17.951,00:35:22.414
"into a circuit,
so springs, or yet other",00:35:22.414,00:35:25.268
"examples undreamt of.
But these are constants.",00:35:25.268,00:35:28.560
"And I'm going to think of it as
time.",00:35:28.560,00:35:32.000
"I think I'll switch back to
time, let x be the time.",00:35:32.000,00:35:37.300
"So, B y equals f of t.
So, there is our equation.",00:35:37.300,00:35:43.224
"A and B are constants.
And, the question is,",00:35:43.224,00:35:47.693
"the question I'm asking,
can think of either of these",00:35:47.693,00:35:53.098
"two models or others,
the question I'm asking is,",00:35:53.098,00:35:58.087
"under what circumstances can I
make that same type of analysis",00:35:58.087,00:36:04.426
"into steady-state and transient?
Well, what does the solution",00:36:04.426,00:36:11.750
"look like?
The solution looks like y",00:36:11.750,00:36:15.187
"equals a particular solution
plus c1 y1 plus c2 y2.",00:36:15.187,00:36:20.687
"Therefore, to make that look",00:36:20.687,00:36:24.812
"like this, the c1 and c2 contain
the initial conditions.",00:36:24.812,00:36:31.000
"This part does not.
Therefore, if I want to say",00:36:31.000,00:36:35.815
"that the solutions look like a
steady state solution plus",00:36:35.815,00:36:41.678
"something that dies away,
which becomes less and less",00:36:41.678,00:36:47.122
"important as time goes on,
what I'm really asking is,",00:36:47.122,00:36:52.566
"under what circumstances is
this part guaranteed to go to",00:36:52.566,00:36:58.429
"zero?
So, the question is,",00:36:58.429,00:37:01.960
"when, in other words,
under what conditions on the",00:37:01.960,00:37:06.764
"equation A and B,
in effect, is what we are",00:37:06.764,00:37:10.882
"asking.
When does c1 y1 plus c2 y2 go",00:37:10.882,00:37:14.411
"to zero as t goes to infinity,",00:37:14.411,00:37:19.901
"regardless of what
c1 and c2 are for all c1 c2.",00:37:19.901,00:37:25.588
"Now, here there was no
difficulty.",00:37:25.588,00:37:30.000
"We had the thing very
explicitly, and you could see k",00:37:30.000,00:37:34.019
"is positive: this goes to zero.
And if k is negative,",00:37:34.019,00:37:38.039
"it doesn't go to zero.
It goes to infinity.",00:37:38.039,00:37:41.286
"Here, I want to make the same
kind of analysis,",00:37:41.286,00:37:44.842
"except it's just going to take,
it's a little more trouble.",00:37:44.842,00:37:49.325
"But the answer,
when it finally comes out is",00:37:49.325,00:37:52.649
"very beautiful.
So, when are all these guys",00:37:52.649,00:37:55.896
"going to go to zero?
First of all,",00:37:55.896,00:37:58.447
"you might as well just have the
definition.",00:37:58.447,00:38:01.694
"So, all the good things that
this is going to imply,",00:38:01.694,00:38:05.636
"if this is so,
in other words,",00:38:05.636,00:38:07.878
"if they all go to zero,
everything in the complementary",00:38:07.878,00:38:12.052
"solution, then the ODE is called
stable.",00:38:12.052,00:38:17.000
"Some people call it
asymptotically stable.",00:38:17.000,00:38:21.961
"I don't know what to call it.
I can make the analysis,",00:38:21.961,00:38:28.375
"and then I use the identical
terminology, c1 y1 plus c2 y2.",00:38:28.375,00:38:36.000
"This is called the transient
because it goes to zero.",00:38:36.000,00:38:40.244
"This is called the particular
solution now that we labored so",00:38:40.244,00:38:45.142
"hard to get for the next two
weeks.",00:38:45.142,00:38:47.918
"It's the important part.
It's the steady-state part.",00:38:47.918,00:38:52.081
"It's what lasts out to infinity
after the other stuff has",00:38:52.081,00:38:56.653
"disappeared.
So, this is the steady-state",00:38:56.653,00:38:59.918
"solution, steady-state solution,
okay?",00:38:59.918,00:39:04.000
"And, the differential equation
is called stable.",00:39:04.000,00:39:07.174
"Now, it's of the highest
interest to know when a",00:39:07.174,00:39:10.348
"differential equation is stable,
linear differential equation is",00:39:10.348,00:39:14.602
"stable in this sense because you
have a control.",00:39:14.602,00:39:17.776
"You know what its solutions
look like.",00:39:17.776,00:39:20.275
"You have some feeling for how
it's behaving in the long term.",00:39:20.275,00:39:24.327
"If this is not so,
each equation is a law unto",00:39:24.327,00:39:27.366
"itself if you don't know.
So, let's do the work.",00:39:27.366,00:39:31.826
"For the rest of the period,
what I'd like to do is to find",00:39:31.826,00:39:36.560
"out what the conditions are,
which make this true.",00:39:36.560,00:39:40.629
"Those were the equations which
we will have a right to call",00:39:40.629,00:39:45.446
"stable.
So, when does this happen,",00:39:45.446,00:39:48.186
"and where is it going to
happen?",00:39:48.186,00:39:50.761
"I don't know.
I guess, here.",00:39:50.761,00:39:54.000
"Now, I think the first step is
fairly easy, and it will give",00:40:05.000,00:40:10.070
"you a good review of what we've
been doing up until now.",00:40:10.070,00:40:14.796
"So, I'm simply going to make a
case-by-case analysis.",00:40:14.796,00:40:19.265
"Don't worry,
it won't take very long.",00:40:19.265,00:40:22.359
"What are the cases we've been
studying?",00:40:22.359,00:40:25.625
"Well, what do the
characteristic roots look like?",00:40:25.625,00:40:29.750
"The roots of the characteristic
equation, in other words,",00:40:29.750,00:40:34.562
"remember, there are cases.
The first case is they are real",00:40:34.562,00:40:41.557
"and distinct,
r1 not equal to r2,",00:40:41.557,00:40:45.229
"real and distinct.
What are the other cases?",00:40:45.229,00:40:50.163
"Well, r1 equals r2.
And then, there's the case",00:40:50.163,00:40:56.704
"where there are complex.
So, I will write it r equals a",00:40:56.704,00:41:02.901
"plus or minus b i.
What do the solutions look",00:41:02.901,00:41:07.673
"like?
So, my ham-handed approach to",00:41:07.673,00:41:09.862
"this problem is going to be,
in each case,",00:41:09.862,00:41:12.501
"I'll look at the solutions,
and first get the condition on",00:41:12.501,00:41:16.170
"the roots.
So, in other words,",00:41:16.170,00:41:18.036
"I'm not going to worry right
away about the a and the b.",00:41:18.036,00:41:21.577
"I'm going, instead,
to worry about expressing this",00:41:21.577,00:41:24.731
"condition of stability in terms
of the characteristic roots.",00:41:24.731,00:41:28.528
"In fact, that's the only way in
which many people know the",00:41:28.528,00:41:32.197
"conditions.
You're going to be smarter.",00:41:32.197,00:41:35.913
"Okay, what do the solutions
look like?",00:41:35.913,00:41:38.535
"Well, the general solution
looks like e to the r1 t plus c2",00:41:38.535,00:41:42.645
e to the r2 t.,00:41:42.645,00:41:45.480
"Okay, so, what's the stability
condition?",00:41:45.480,00:41:48.314
"In other words,
if equation happened to have",00:41:48.314,00:41:51.362
"its characteristic roots,
real and distinct,",00:41:51.362,00:41:54.409
"under what circumstances would
it be stable?",00:41:54.409,00:41:57.456
"Would it, in other words,
all its solutions go to zero?",00:41:57.456,00:42:01.283
"So, I'm talking about the
homogeneous equation,",00:42:01.283,00:42:04.543
"the reduced equation,
the associated homogeneous",00:42:04.543,00:42:07.874
"equation.
Why?",00:42:07.874,00:42:10.291
"Because that's all that's
involved in this.",00:42:10.291,00:42:13.348
"In other words,
when I write that,",00:42:13.348,00:42:15.750
"I am no longer interested in
the whole equation.",00:42:15.750,00:42:19.172
"All I'm interested in is the
reduced equation,",00:42:19.172,00:42:22.448
"the equation where you turn the
f of t on the",00:42:22.448,00:42:26.306
"right-hand side into zero.
So, what's the stability",00:42:26.306,00:42:31.529
"condition?
Well, let's write it out.",00:42:31.529,00:42:35.219
"Under what circumstances will
all these guys go to zero?",00:42:35.219,00:42:41.017
"If r1 and r2 should be
negative, can they be zero?",00:42:41.017,00:42:46.182
"No, because then it will be a
constant and it will go to zero.",00:42:46.182,00:42:52.612
"How about this one?
Well, in this one,",00:42:52.612,00:42:56.512
"it's (c1 plus c2 times t)
multiplied by e to the r1 t.",00:42:56.512,00:43:01.994
"Of course, both of these are",00:43:01.994,00:43:08.159
"the same.
I'll just arbitrarily pick one",00:43:08.159,00:43:11.168
"of them.
What happens to this as things",00:43:11.168,00:43:14.099
"go to zero?
Well, this part is rising,",00:43:14.099,00:43:16.954
"at least if c2 is positive.
This part is either helping or",00:43:16.954,00:43:21.351
"it's hindering.
But, I hope you know what these",00:43:21.351,00:43:24.900
"functions look like,
and you know which of them go",00:43:24.900,00:43:28.679
"to zero.
They go to zero if r1 is",00:43:28.679,00:43:31.148
"negative.
It might rise in the beginning,",00:43:31.148,00:43:35.948
"but after a while they lose the
energy.",00:43:35.948,00:43:39.561
"Of course, if r1 is equal to
zero, what do these guys do?",00:43:39.561,00:43:44.887
"Linear, go to infinity.
Well, we are doing okay.",00:43:44.887,00:43:49.357
"How about here?
Well, here, it's a little more",00:43:49.357,00:43:53.636
"complicated.
The solutions look like e to",00:43:53.636,00:43:57.440
"the at times (c1 cosine bt plus
c2 sine bt).",00:43:57.440,00:44:03.337
"Now, this part is a pure",00:44:03.337,00:44:07.828
"oscillation.
You know that.",00:44:07.828,00:44:09.809
"It might have a big amplitude,
but whatever it does,",00:44:09.809,00:44:13.695
"it does the same thing all the
time.",00:44:13.695,00:44:16.361
"So, whether this goes to zero
depends entirely upon what that",00:44:16.361,00:44:20.933
"exponential is doing.
And, that exponential goes to",00:44:20.933,00:44:24.742
"zero if a is negative.
So here, the condition is",00:44:24.742,00:44:28.323
"negative.
And now, the only thing left to",00:44:28.323,00:44:33.677
"do is to say it nicely.
I've got three cases,",00:44:33.677,00:44:38.898
"and I want to say them all in
one breath.",00:44:38.898,00:44:43.644
"So, the stability condition is,
the ODE is stable.",00:44:43.644,00:44:49.457
"So, this is,
or f of t.",00:44:49.457,00:44:53.135
"It doesn't matter.
But, psychologically,",00:44:53.135,00:44:57.762
"you can put this as zero there,
is stable if what?",00:44:57.762,00:45:05.000
"In case one,
this is true.",00:45:05.000,00:45:07.764
"In case two,
that's true.",00:45:07.764,00:45:10.418
"In case three,
that's true.",00:45:10.418,00:45:13.293
"But that's ugly.
Make it beautiful.",00:45:13.293,00:45:17.052
"The beautiful way of saying it
is if all the characteristic",00:45:17.052,00:45:23.466
"roots have negative real parts.
If the characteristic roots,",00:45:23.466,00:45:31.227
"the r's or the a plus or minus
b i, have negative real part.",00:45:31.227,00:45:38.027
"That's the form in which the
electrical engineers will nod",00:45:38.027,00:45:44.596
"their head, tell you,
yeah, that's right,",00:45:44.596,00:45:49.206
"negative real part,
sorry.",00:45:49.206,00:45:52.088
"Isn't it right?
Is that right here?",00:45:52.088,00:45:56.006
"Yeah.
What's the real part of these",00:45:56.006,00:45:59.925
"guys?
They themselves,",00:45:59.925,00:46:03.836
"because they are real.
What's the real part of this?",00:46:03.836,00:46:09.691
"Yeah.
The only case in which I really",00:46:09.691,00:46:13.824
"had to use real part is when I
talk about the complex case",00:46:13.824,00:46:20.367
"because a is just the real part
of a complex number.",00:46:20.367,00:46:26.222
It's not the whole thing.,00:46:26.222,00:46:27.888
