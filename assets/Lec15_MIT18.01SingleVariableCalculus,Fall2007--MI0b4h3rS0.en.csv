"PROFESSOR: Today we're moving
on from theoretical things,",00:00:22.530,00:00:24.970
"from the mean value theorem,
to the introduction to what's",00:00:24.970,00:00:30.570
"going to occupy us for the
whole rest of the course, which",00:00:30.570,00:00:33.120
is integration.,00:00:33.120,00:00:34.850
"So, in order to
introduce that subject,",00:00:34.850,00:00:38.850
"I need to introduce for
you a new notation, which",00:00:38.850,00:00:42.660
is called differentials.,00:00:42.660,00:00:52.640
"I'm going to tell you
what a differential is,",00:00:52.640,00:00:55.640
"and we'll get used to
using it over time.",00:00:55.640,00:01:02.040
"If you have a function
which is y = f(x),",00:01:02.040,00:01:10.290
"then the differential of y
is going to be denoted dy,",00:01:10.290,00:01:27.650
and it's by definition f'(x) dx.,00:01:27.650,00:01:29.500
So here's the notation.,00:01:34.160,00:01:41.410
"And because y is really
equal to f, sometimes",00:01:41.410,00:01:44.800
"we also call it the
differential of f.",00:01:44.800,00:01:50.140
"It's also called the
differential of f.",00:01:50.140,00:01:58.700
"That's the notation,
and it's the same thing",00:01:58.700,00:02:06.750
"as what happens if you
formally just take this dx,",00:02:06.750,00:02:11.630
"act like it's a number
and divide it into dy.",00:02:11.630,00:02:14.910
"So it means the same thing
as this statement here.",00:02:14.910,00:02:22.670
"And this is more or less
the Leibniz interpretation",00:02:22.670,00:02:29.160
of derivatives.,00:02:29.160,00:02:38.360
"Of a derivative as a ratio of
these so called differentials.",00:02:38.360,00:02:50.990
"It's a ratio of what are
known as infinitesimals.",00:02:50.990,00:03:04.290
"Now, this is kind of a vague
notion, this little bit",00:03:04.290,00:03:09.050
here being an infinitesimal.,00:03:09.050,00:03:12.830
"It's sort of like an
infinitely small quantity.",00:03:12.830,00:03:16.110
"And Leibniz perfected
the idea of dealing",00:03:16.110,00:03:21.300
with these intuitively.,00:03:21.300,00:03:23.050
"And subsequently, mathematicians
use them all the time.",00:03:23.050,00:03:26.730
"They're way more effective than
the notation that Newton used.",00:03:26.730,00:03:33.350
"You might think that
notations are a small matter,",00:03:33.350,00:03:36.250
"but they allow you to think
much faster, sometimes.",00:03:36.250,00:03:40.960
"When you have the right
names and the right symbols",00:03:40.960,00:03:43.565
for everything.,00:03:43.565,00:03:44.190
"And in this case it made
it very big difference.",00:03:44.190,00:03:47.860
"Leibniz's notation was adopted
on the continent and Newton",00:03:47.860,00:03:52.850
"dominated in Britain
and, as a result,",00:03:52.850,00:03:56.650
"the British fell
behind by one or two",00:03:56.650,00:03:58.800
"hundred years in the
development of calculus.",00:03:58.800,00:04:01.850
It was really a serious matter.,00:04:01.850,00:04:03.540
"So it's really well
worth your while to get",00:04:03.540,00:04:05.860
used to this idea of ratios.,00:04:05.860,00:04:08.940
"And it comes up all over the
place, both in this class",00:04:08.940,00:04:12.140
"and also in
multivariable calculus.",00:04:12.140,00:04:14.320
It's used in many contexts.,00:04:14.320,00:04:17.380
"So first of all, just
to go a little bit easy.",00:04:17.380,00:04:20.030
"We'll illustrate it by its
use in linear approximations,",00:04:20.030,00:04:25.320
which we've already done.,00:04:25.320,00:04:36.420
"The picture here, which we've
drawn a number of times,",00:04:36.420,00:04:38.780
is that you have some function.,00:04:38.780,00:04:41.020
"And here's a value
of the function.",00:04:41.020,00:04:44.300
And it's coming up like that.,00:04:44.300,00:04:47.060
So here's our function.,00:04:47.060,00:04:48.330
"And we go forward
a little increment",00:04:48.330,00:04:51.090
"to a place which is
dx further along.",00:04:51.090,00:04:56.540
"The idea of this
notation is that dx",00:04:56.540,00:04:59.350
"is going to replace
the symbol delta x,",00:04:59.350,00:05:05.260
which is the change in x.,00:05:05.260,00:05:07.370
"And we won't think
too hard about-- well,",00:05:07.370,00:05:10.270
"this is a small quantity,
this is a small quantity,",00:05:10.270,00:05:12.560
"we're not going to think too
hard about what that means.",00:05:12.560,00:05:16.030
"Now, similarly, if you see
how much we've gone up - well,",00:05:16.030,00:05:20.780
"this is kind of low, so
it's a small bit here.",00:05:20.780,00:05:26.600
"So this distance
here is, previously",00:05:26.600,00:05:31.240
we called it delta y.,00:05:31.240,00:05:36.040
"But now we're just
going to call it dy.",00:05:36.040,00:05:41.810
So dy replaces delta y.,00:05:41.810,00:05:51.200
"So this is the change in
level of the function.",00:05:51.200,00:05:57.450
"And we'll represent it
symbolically this way.",00:05:57.450,00:05:59.760
"Very frequently, this just
saves a little bit of notation.",00:05:59.760,00:06:04.050
"For the purposes
of this, we'll be",00:06:04.050,00:06:05.930
"doing the same things we did
with delta x and delta y,",00:06:05.930,00:06:09.620
"but this is the way that
Leibniz thought of it.",00:06:09.620,00:06:12.540
"And he would just have
drawn it with this.",00:06:12.540,00:06:14.690
"So this distance here is dx
and this distance here is dy.",00:06:14.690,00:06:24.670
"So for an example of
linear approximation,",00:06:24.670,00:06:30.320
"we'll say what's 64.1,
say, to the 1/3 power,",00:06:30.320,00:06:35.970
approximately equal to?,00:06:35.970,00:06:39.500
"Now, I'm going to carry this
out in this new notation here.",00:06:39.500,00:06:43.470
The function involved is x^1/3.,00:06:43.470,00:06:47.810
"And then it's a
differential, dy.",00:06:47.810,00:06:50.990
"Now, I want to use this
rule to get used to it.",00:06:50.990,00:06:53.670
"Because this is what we're going
to be doing all of today is,",00:06:53.670,00:06:56.870
"we're differentiating, or
taking the differential of y.",00:06:56.870,00:07:00.010
"So that is going to be
just the derivative.",00:07:00.010,00:07:02.490
That's 1/3 x^(-2/3) dx.,00:07:02.490,00:07:11.980
"And now I'm just going to
fill in exactly what this is.",00:07:11.980,00:07:18.060
"At x = 64, which is the natural
place close by where it's easy",00:07:18.060,00:07:25.450
"to do the evaluations, we have
y = 64^(1/3), which is just 4.",00:07:25.450,00:07:36.110
And how about dy?,00:07:36.110,00:07:39.740
"Well, so this is a little
bit more complicated.",00:07:39.740,00:07:42.360
Put it over here.,00:07:42.360,00:07:43.540
So dy = 1/3 64^(-2/3) dx.,00:07:43.540,00:07:50.690
"And that is 1/3 * 1/16
dx, which is 1/48 dx.",00:07:55.800,00:08:16.680
"And now I'm going
to work out what",00:08:16.680,00:08:19.810
"64 to the, whatever it is
here, this strange fraction.",00:08:19.810,00:08:26.320
"I just want to be very careful
to explain to you one more",00:08:26.320,00:08:31.210
thing.,00:08:31.210,00:08:33.170
"Which is that
we're using x = 64,",00:08:33.170,00:08:37.780
"and so we're thinking of x
+ dx is going to be 64.1.",00:08:37.780,00:08:45.240
"So that means that dx
is going to be 1/10.",00:08:45.240,00:08:53.700
"So that's the increment
that we're interested in.",00:08:53.700,00:08:59.760
"And now I can carry
out the approximation.",00:08:59.760,00:09:03.910
"The approximation says
that 64.1^(1/3) is, well,",00:09:03.910,00:09:11.230
"it's approximately what
I'm going to call y + dy.",00:09:11.230,00:09:14.710
"Because really, the dy
that I'm determining here",00:09:14.710,00:09:18.060
"is determined by this linear
relation. dy = 1/48 dx.",00:09:18.060,00:09:26.450
"And so this is only
approximately true.",00:09:26.450,00:09:29.820
"Because what's really
true is that this",00:09:29.820,00:09:33.430
is equal to y + delta y.,00:09:33.430,00:09:37.690
In our previous notation.,00:09:37.690,00:09:39.590
So this is in disguise.,00:09:39.590,00:09:41.600
What this is equal to.,00:09:41.600,00:09:42.960
"And that's the
only approximately",00:09:42.960,00:09:44.500
"equal to what the linear
approximation would give you.",00:09:44.500,00:09:47.470
"So, really, even though I wrote
dy is this increment here,",00:09:47.470,00:09:51.730
"what it really is if
dx is exactly that,",00:09:51.730,00:09:54.830
"is it's the amount
it would go up",00:09:54.830,00:09:57.410
"if you went straight
up the tangent line.",00:09:57.410,00:10:00.270
"So I'm not going to do
that because that's not",00:10:00.270,00:10:02.300
what people write.,00:10:02.300,00:10:03.370
"And that's not even
what they think.",00:10:03.370,00:10:06.040
"They're really thinking
of both dx and dy",00:10:06.040,00:10:08.110
as being infinitesimally small.,00:10:08.110,00:10:10.750
"And here we're going to the
finite level and doing it.",00:10:10.750,00:10:15.900
"So this is just something
you have to live with,",00:10:15.900,00:10:20.350
"is a little ambiguity
in this notation.",00:10:20.350,00:10:28.120
This is the approximation.,00:10:28.120,00:10:29.490
"And now I can just calculate
these numbers here.",00:10:29.490,00:10:32.970
y at this value is 4.,00:10:32.970,00:10:36.130
"And dy, as I said, is 1/48 dx.",00:10:36.130,00:10:43.630
"And that turns out to be 4
+ 1/480, because dx is 1/10.",00:10:43.630,00:10:50.440
So that's approximately 4.002.,00:10:50.440,00:10:54.390
And that's our approximation.,00:10:54.390,00:11:04.550
"Now, let's just compare it
to our previous notation.",00:11:04.550,00:11:20.760
"This will serve as
a review of, if you",00:11:20.760,00:11:22.970
"like, of linear approximation.",00:11:22.970,00:11:35.870
"But what I want to emphasize
is that these things",00:11:35.870,00:11:38.990
are supposed to be the same.,00:11:38.990,00:11:43.210
"Just that it's really
the same thing.",00:11:43.210,00:11:45.520
"It's just a different
notation for the same thing.",00:11:45.520,00:11:52.280
"I remind you the basic formula
for linear approximation is",00:11:52.280,00:11:56.360
"that f(x) is approximately
f(a) + f'(a) (x-a).",00:11:56.360,00:12:00.980
"And we're applying it in the
situation that a = 64 and f(x)",00:12:05.160,00:12:11.620
= x^(1/3).,00:12:11.620,00:12:12.910
"And so f(a), which is
f(64), is of course 4.",00:12:17.980,00:12:27.580
"And f'(a), which is 1/3
a^(-2/3), is in our case 1/16.",00:12:27.580,00:12:43.210
"No, 1/48.",00:12:43.210,00:12:49.600
"OK, that's the same
calculation as before.",00:12:49.600,00:12:52.980
"And then our relationship
becomes x^(1/3) is",00:12:52.980,00:12:59.490
"approximately equal to 4 plus
1/48 times x minus a, which is",00:12:59.490,00:13:08.420
64.,00:13:08.420,00:13:12.250
"So look, every single number
that I've written over here",00:13:12.250,00:13:14.820
"has a corresponding number
for this other method.",00:13:14.820,00:13:20.030
"And now if I plug in the
value we happen to want,",00:13:20.030,00:13:23.250
"which is the 64.1, this
would be 4 + 1/48 1/10,",00:13:23.250,00:13:32.500
"which is just the same
thing we had before.",00:13:32.500,00:13:38.580
"So again, same answer.",00:13:38.580,00:13:45.270
"Same method, new notation.",00:13:45.270,00:13:55.300
"Well, now I get to use this
notation in a novel way.",00:13:55.300,00:14:02.300
"So again, here's the notation.",00:14:02.300,00:14:04.640
This notation of differential.,00:14:04.640,00:14:16.410
"The way I'm going to use it
is in discussing something",00:14:16.410,00:14:20.520
"called antiderivative Again,
this is a new notation now.",00:14:20.520,00:14:32.560
But it's also a new idea.,00:14:32.560,00:14:33.680
"It's one that we
haven't discussed yet.",00:14:33.680,00:14:37.850
"Namely, the notation that
I want to describe here",00:14:37.850,00:14:42.500
"is what's called the
integral of g(x) dx.",00:14:42.500,00:14:48.090
"And I'll denote that by a
function capital G of x.",00:14:48.090,00:14:51.560
"So it's, you start
with a function g(x)",00:14:51.560,00:14:53.820
"and you produce a
function capital",00:14:53.820,00:14:55.380
"G(x), which is called
the antiderivative of g.",00:14:55.380,00:15:12.190
"Notice there's a
differential sitting in here.",00:15:12.190,00:15:15.330
"This symbol, this guy here,
is called an integral sign.",00:15:15.330,00:15:31.380
"Or an integral, or this whole
thing is called an integral.",00:15:31.380,00:15:34.600
"And another name for
the antiderivative of g",00:15:34.600,00:15:37.830
is the indefinite integral of g.,00:15:37.830,00:15:50.700
"And I'll explain to you why
it's indefinite in just--",00:15:50.700,00:15:58.050
very shortly here.,00:15:58.050,00:16:04.330
"Well, so let's carry
out some examples.",00:16:04.330,00:16:13.330
"Basically what I'd like
to do is as many examples",00:16:13.330,00:16:16.840
"along the lines of
all the derivatives",00:16:16.840,00:16:18.510
"that we derived at the
beginning of the course.",00:16:18.510,00:16:21.329
"In other words, in
principle you want",00:16:21.329,00:16:22.870
"to be able to integrate as
many things as possible.",00:16:22.870,00:16:26.550
"We're going to start out with
the integral of sin x dx.",00:16:26.550,00:16:34.680
"That's a function whose
derivative is sin x.",00:16:34.680,00:16:40.670
So what function would that be?,00:16:40.670,00:16:44.990
"Cosine x, minus, right.",00:16:44.990,00:16:48.400
It's -cos x.,00:16:48.400,00:16:49.590
"So -cos x differentiated
gives you sin x.",00:16:52.700,00:16:56.240
"So that is an
antiderivative of sine.",00:16:56.240,00:17:00.540
And it satisfies this property.,00:17:00.540,00:17:02.210
"So this function,
G(x) = - cos x,",00:17:02.210,00:17:09.520
"has the property that
its derivative is sin x.",00:17:09.520,00:17:15.170
"On the other hand, if you
differentiate a constant,",00:17:15.170,00:17:20.700
you get 0.,00:17:20.700,00:17:22.230
"So this answer is what's
called indefinite.",00:17:22.230,00:17:25.090
"Because you can also
add any constant here.",00:17:25.090,00:17:28.910
And the same thing will be true.,00:17:28.910,00:17:33.610
"So, c is constant.",00:17:33.610,00:17:38.060
"And as I said, the integral
is called indefinite.",00:17:38.060,00:17:41.660
"So that's an explanation
for this modifier",00:17:41.660,00:17:45.410
"in front of the ""integral"".",00:17:45.410,00:17:46.810
"It's indefinite because
we actually didn't",00:17:46.810,00:17:48.960
specify a single function.,00:17:48.960,00:17:50.540
We don't get a single answer.,00:17:50.540,00:17:52.170
"Whenever you take the
antiderivative of something",00:17:52.170,00:17:54.400
it's ambiguous up to a constant.,00:17:54.400,00:18:08.110
"Next, let's do some
other standard functions",00:18:08.110,00:18:12.340
from our repertoire.,00:18:12.340,00:18:13.890
We have the integral of x^a dx.,00:18:13.890,00:18:17.820
"Some power, the
integral of a power.",00:18:17.820,00:18:20.730
"And if you think about it, what
you should be differentiating",00:18:20.730,00:18:24.680
is one power larger than that.,00:18:24.680,00:18:27.590
"But then you have to
divide by 1/(a+1),",00:18:27.590,00:18:33.250
"in order that the
differentiation be correct.",00:18:33.250,00:18:36.780
"So this just is the fact
that d/dx of x^(a+1),",00:18:36.780,00:18:44.360
"or maybe I should
even say it this way.",00:18:44.360,00:18:46.600
"Maybe I'll do it in
differential notation.",00:18:46.600,00:18:49.620
d(x^(a+1)) = (a+1) x^a dx.,00:18:49.620,00:18:54.230
"So if I divide that
through by a+1,",00:18:57.370,00:19:02.950
then I get the relation above.,00:19:02.950,00:19:06.280
"And because this is
ambiguous up to a constant,",00:19:06.280,00:19:11.800
"it could be any
additional constant",00:19:11.800,00:19:15.820
added to that function.,00:19:15.820,00:19:20.830
"Now, the identity that I
wrote down below is correct.",00:19:20.830,00:19:26.290
"But this one is
not always correct.",00:19:26.290,00:19:30.700
What's the exception?,00:19:30.700,00:19:35.200
Yeah. a equals--,00:19:35.200,00:19:38.211
STUDENT: 0.,00:19:38.211,00:19:38.710
PROFESSOR: Negative 1.,00:19:38.710,00:19:42.060
So this one is OK for all a.,00:19:42.060,00:19:47.440
"But this one fails because
we've divided by 0 when a = -1.",00:19:47.440,00:19:52.550
"So this is only true when
a is not equal to -1.",00:19:52.550,00:20:04.770
"And in fact, of course,
what's happening when a = 0,",00:20:04.770,00:20:07.790
"you're getting 0 when you
differentiate the constant.",00:20:07.790,00:20:11.670
"So there's a third case
that we have to carry out.",00:20:11.670,00:20:15.510
"Which is the exceptional case,
namely the integral of dx/x.",00:20:15.510,00:20:25.230
"And this time, if
we just think back",00:20:25.230,00:20:31.265
"to what our-- So
what we're doing",00:20:31.265,00:20:32.640
"is thinking backwards here,
which a very important thing",00:20:32.640,00:20:35.080
to do in math at all stages.,00:20:35.080,00:20:38.690
"We got all of our formulas, now
we're reading them backwards.",00:20:38.690,00:20:41.800
"And so this one, you
may remember, is ln x.",00:20:41.800,00:20:49.890
"The reason why I want to do
this carefully and slowly now,",00:20:49.890,00:20:53.370
"is right now I also want to
write the more standard form",00:20:53.370,00:20:57.299
which is presented.,00:20:57.299,00:20:58.090
"So first of all, first we
have to add a constant.",00:20:58.090,00:21:01.540
"And please don't put
the parentheses here.",00:21:01.540,00:21:04.160
The parentheses go there.,00:21:04.160,00:21:10.360
"But there's another formula
hiding in the woodwork",00:21:10.360,00:21:14.700
here behind this one.,00:21:14.700,00:21:16.500
"Which is that you can also
get the correct formula",00:21:16.500,00:21:19.260
when x is negative.,00:21:19.260,00:21:20.870
"And that turns out
to be this one here.",00:21:20.870,00:21:27.130
"So I'm treating the case, x
positive, as being something",00:21:27.130,00:21:32.670
that you know.,00:21:32.670,00:21:34.460
"But let's check the
case, x negative.",00:21:34.460,00:21:43.530
"In order to check
the case x negative,",00:21:43.530,00:21:45.810
"I have to differentiate the
logarithm of the absolute value",00:21:45.810,00:21:51.750
of x in that case.,00:21:51.750,00:21:55.680
"And that's the
same thing, again,",00:21:55.680,00:21:57.612
"for x negative as the derivative
of the logarithm of negative x.",00:21:57.612,00:22:02.170
"That's the formula,
when x is negative.",00:22:02.170,00:22:08.410
"And if you carry
that out, what you",00:22:08.410,00:22:10.980
"get, maybe I'll put
this over here, is,",00:22:10.980,00:22:18.400
"well, it's the chain rule.",00:22:18.400,00:22:20.800
"It's 1/(-x) times the derivative
with respect to x of -x.",00:22:20.800,00:22:27.160
"So see that there
are two minus signs.",00:22:27.160,00:22:30.730
"There's a -x in the
denominator and then",00:22:30.730,00:22:32.750
"there's the derivative
of -x in the numerator.",00:22:32.750,00:22:35.610
That's just -1.,00:22:35.610,00:22:38.070
This part is -1.,00:22:38.070,00:22:39.160
"So this -1 over
-x, which is 1/x.",00:22:39.160,00:22:43.100
So the negative signs cancel.,00:22:43.100,00:22:53.200
"If you just keep track of this
in terms of ln(-x) and its",00:22:53.200,00:23:00.090
"graph, that's a function
that looks like this.",00:23:00.090,00:23:05.480
For x negative.,00:23:05.480,00:23:08.370
"And its derivative
is 1/x, I claim.",00:23:08.370,00:23:14.170
"And if you just look at
it a little bit carefully,",00:23:14.170,00:23:17.120
"you see that the slope
is always negative.",00:23:17.120,00:23:23.431
Right?,00:23:23.431,00:23:23.930
So here the slope is negative.,00:23:23.930,00:23:26.950
"So it's going to
be below the axis.",00:23:26.950,00:23:30.480
"And, in fact, it's getting
steeper and steeper negative",00:23:30.480,00:23:32.890
as we go down.,00:23:32.890,00:23:34.980
"And it's getting less and less
negative as we go horizontally.",00:23:34.980,00:23:37.980
"So it's going like
this, which is indeed",00:23:37.980,00:23:40.790
"the graph of this
function, for x negative.",00:23:40.790,00:23:43.770
"Again, x negative.",00:23:43.770,00:23:53.320
"So that's one other
standard formula.",00:23:53.320,00:23:56.850
"And very quickly, very often,
we won't put the absolute value",00:23:56.850,00:24:00.501
signs.,00:24:00.501,00:24:01.000
"We'll only consider the
case x positive here.",00:24:01.000,00:24:03.180
"But I just want you to
have the tools to do it",00:24:03.180,00:24:06.280
"in case we want to
use, we want to handle,",00:24:06.280,00:24:08.710
both positive and negative x.,00:24:08.710,00:24:14.040
"Now, let's do two more examples.",00:24:14.040,00:24:28.620
The integral of sec^2 x dx.,00:24:28.620,00:24:35.870
"These are supposed to
get you to remember",00:24:35.870,00:24:38.270
"all of your differentiation
formulas, the standard ones.",00:24:38.270,00:24:41.130
"So this one, integral of
sec^2 dx is what? tan x.",00:24:41.130,00:24:48.200
"And here we have + c, all right?",00:24:48.200,00:24:50.690
"And then the last one of, a
couple of, this type would be,",00:24:50.690,00:24:55.520
let's see.,00:24:55.520,00:24:56.800
"I should do at least this one
here, square root of 1 - x^2.",00:24:56.800,00:25:04.139
"This is another
notation, by the way,",00:25:04.139,00:25:05.680
which is perfectly acceptable.,00:25:05.680,00:25:07.240
"Notice I've put the
dx in the numerator",00:25:07.240,00:25:10.280
"and the function in
the denominator here.",00:25:10.280,00:25:13.400
"So this one turns
out to be sin^(-1) x.",00:25:13.400,00:25:18.880
"And, finally, let's see.",00:25:18.880,00:25:23.710
"About the integral
of dx / (1 + x^2).",00:25:23.710,00:25:28.470
That one is tan^(-1) x.,00:25:28.470,00:25:41.320
"For a little while, because
you're reading these things",00:25:41.320,00:25:43.652
"backwards and
forwards, you'll find",00:25:43.652,00:25:45.110
this happens to you on exams.,00:25:45.110,00:25:46.970
"It gets slightly worse
for a little while.",00:25:46.970,00:25:49.540
"You will antidifferentiate when
you meant to differentiate.",00:25:49.540,00:25:53.120
"And you'll differentiate
when you're",00:25:53.120,00:25:54.620
meant to antidifferentiate.,00:25:54.620,00:25:57.230
"Don't get too
frustrated by that.",00:25:57.230,00:26:00.190
"But eventually, you'll
get them squared away.",00:26:00.190,00:26:05.270
"And it actually helps
to do a lot of practice",00:26:05.270,00:26:08.130
"with antidifferentiations,
or integrations,",00:26:08.130,00:26:15.410
as they're sometimes called.,00:26:15.410,00:26:17.100
"Because that will
solidify your remembering",00:26:17.100,00:26:19.790
"all of the
differentiation formulas.",00:26:19.790,00:26:25.820
"So, last bit of
information that I",00:26:25.820,00:26:30.080
"want to emphasize before
we go on some more",00:26:30.080,00:26:32.730
complicated examples is this.,00:26:32.730,00:26:44.130
"It's obvious because the
derivative of a constant is 0.",00:26:44.130,00:26:49.250
"That the antiderivative is
ambiguous up to a constant.",00:26:49.250,00:26:55.330
"But it's very
important to realize",00:26:55.330,00:26:56.920
"that this is the only
ambiguity that there is.",00:26:56.920,00:27:01.410
"So the last thing that
I want to tell you about",00:27:01.410,00:27:04.390
"is uniqueness of antiderivatives
up to a constant.",00:27:04.390,00:27:24.070
The theorem is the following.,00:27:24.070,00:27:30.290
"The theorem is if F' =
G', then F equals G--",00:27:30.290,00:27:41.230
"so F(x) equals G(x)
plus a constant.",00:27:41.230,00:27:43.620
"But that means, not only that
these are antiderivatives,",00:27:48.420,00:27:54.050
"all these things with these
plus c's are antiderivatives.",00:27:54.050,00:27:56.640
But these are the only ones.,00:27:56.640,00:28:02.080
Which is very reassuring.,00:28:02.080,00:28:03.300
"And that's a kind of uniqueness,
although its uniqueness up",00:28:03.300,00:28:06.020
"to a constant, it's
acceptable to us.",00:28:06.020,00:28:09.660
"Now, the proof of
this is very quick.",00:28:09.660,00:28:12.850
But this is a fundamental fact.,00:28:12.850,00:28:18.216
The proof is the following.,00:28:18.216,00:28:19.340
"If F' = G', then if you take
the difference between the two",00:28:19.340,00:28:29.340
"functions, its derivative,
which of course is F' -",00:28:29.340,00:28:33.520
"G', is equal to 0.",00:28:33.520,00:28:40.110
"Hence, F(x) - G(x)
is a constant.",00:28:40.110,00:28:55.300
"Now, this is a key fact.",00:28:55.300,00:28:58.940
Very important fact.,00:28:58.940,00:28:59.870
"We deduced it last time
from the mean value theorem.",00:28:59.870,00:29:03.840
It's not a small matter.,00:29:03.840,00:29:05.370
"It's a very, very
important thing.",00:29:05.370,00:29:06.850
It's the basis for calculus.,00:29:06.850,00:29:08.690
"It's the reason why
calculus make sense.",00:29:08.690,00:29:11.550
"If we didn't have the fact
that the derivative is",00:29:11.550,00:29:14.120
"0 implied that the function
was constant, we would be done.",00:29:14.120,00:29:18.890
"We would have-- Calculus
would be just useless for us.",00:29:18.890,00:29:23.012
"The point is, the
rate of change is",00:29:23.012,00:29:24.470
"supposed to determine
the function up",00:29:24.470,00:29:27.330
to this starting value.,00:29:27.330,00:29:29.650
"So this conclusion
is very important.",00:29:29.650,00:29:32.330
"And we already checked it
last time, this conclusion.",00:29:32.330,00:29:35.010
"And now just by
algebra, I can rearrange",00:29:35.010,00:29:37.710
"this to say that F(x) is
equal to G(x) plus a constant.",00:29:37.710,00:30:03.340
"Now, maybe I should leave
differentials up here.",00:30:03.340,00:30:07.530
"Because I want to
illustrate-- So let's",00:30:07.530,00:30:21.390
"go on to some trickier,
slightly trickier, integrals.",00:30:21.390,00:30:29.050
Here's an example.,00:30:29.050,00:30:35.740
"The integral of, say,
x^3 (x^4 + 2)^5 dx.",00:30:35.740,00:30:42.010
"This is a function
which you actually",00:30:51.210,00:30:53.480
"do know how to integrate,
because we already",00:30:53.480,00:30:56.500
have a formula for all powers.,00:30:56.500,00:30:59.840
"Namely, the integral of
x^a is equal to this.",00:30:59.840,00:31:03.280
"And even if it were a negative
power, we could do it.",00:31:03.280,00:31:06.520
So it's OK.,00:31:06.520,00:31:08.630
"On the other hand, to expand the
5th power here is quite a mess.",00:31:08.630,00:31:14.290
"And this is just a
very, very bad idea.",00:31:14.290,00:31:18.480
"There's another trick for
doing this that evaluates this",00:31:18.480,00:31:21.320
much more efficiently.,00:31:21.320,00:31:23.060
"And it's the only
device that we're going",00:31:23.060,00:31:26.950
to learn now for integrating.,00:31:26.950,00:31:31.550
"Integration actually is much
harder than differentiation,",00:31:31.550,00:31:36.690
symbolically.,00:31:36.690,00:31:37.520
"It's quite difficult. And
occasionally impossible.",00:31:37.520,00:31:42.610
"And so we have to
go about it gently.",00:31:42.610,00:31:45.550
"But for the purposes
of this unit,",00:31:45.550,00:31:47.450
"we're only going
to use one method.",00:31:47.450,00:31:50.069
Which is very good.,00:31:50.069,00:31:50.860
"That means whenever
you see an integral,",00:31:50.860,00:31:52.526
"either you'll be able to divine
immediately what the answer is,",00:31:52.526,00:31:56.180
or you'll use this method.,00:31:56.180,00:31:57.830
So this is it.,00:31:57.830,00:31:59.090
"The trick is called the
method of substitution.",00:31:59.090,00:32:09.470
"And it is tailor-made for
notion of differentials.",00:32:09.470,00:32:17.860
"So tailor-made for
differential notation.",00:32:17.860,00:32:36.510
The idea is the following.,00:32:36.510,00:32:37.840
"I'm going to to
define a new function.",00:32:37.840,00:32:40.260
"And it's the messiest
function that I see here.",00:32:40.260,00:32:43.200
It's u = x^4 + 2.,00:32:43.200,00:32:50.290
"And then, I'm going to take
its differential and what",00:32:50.290,00:32:56.300
"I discover, if I
look at its formula,",00:32:56.300,00:32:58.840
"and the rule for differentials,
which is right here.",00:32:58.840,00:33:02.570
Its formula is what?,00:33:02.570,00:33:06.070
4x^3 dx.,00:33:06.070,00:33:10.180
"Now, lo and behold with
these two quantities,",00:33:10.180,00:33:14.000
"I can substitute, I can
plug in to this integral.",00:33:14.000,00:33:17.940
"And I will simplify
it considerably.",00:33:17.940,00:33:21.760
So how does that happen?,00:33:21.760,00:33:23.350
"Well, this integral is the
same thing as, well, really",00:33:23.350,00:33:34.740
"I should combine
it the other way.",00:33:34.740,00:33:36.350
So let me move this over.,00:33:36.350,00:33:41.420
So there are two pieces here.,00:33:41.420,00:33:43.340
And this one is u^5.,00:33:43.340,00:33:46.440
And this one is 1/4 du.,00:33:46.440,00:33:54.990
"Now, that makes it the
integral of u^5 du / 4.",00:33:54.990,00:34:01.840
"And that's relatively
easy to integrate.",00:34:01.840,00:34:04.040
That is just a power.,00:34:04.040,00:34:05.460
So let's see.,00:34:05.460,00:34:06.410
"It's just 1/20 u to
the-- whoops, not 1/20.",00:34:06.410,00:34:11.250
"The antiderivative
of u^5 is u^6.",00:34:11.250,00:34:15.480
"With the 1/6, so
it's 1/24 u^6 + c.",00:34:15.480,00:34:25.480
"Now, that's not the
answer to the question.",00:34:25.480,00:34:29.050
"It's almost the answer
to the question.",00:34:29.050,00:34:32.260
Why isn't it the answer?,00:34:32.260,00:34:33.287
"It isn't the answer
because now the answer's",00:34:33.287,00:34:35.120
expressed in terms of u.,00:34:35.120,00:34:37.480
"Whereas the problem was posed
in terms of this variable x.",00:34:37.480,00:34:41.750
"So we must change back
to our variable here.",00:34:41.750,00:34:45.960
"And we do that just
by writing it in.",00:34:45.960,00:34:47.990
So it's 1/24 (x^4 + 2)^6 + c.,00:34:47.990,00:34:56.190
"And this is the
end of the problem.",00:34:56.190,00:35:02.120
"Yeah, question.",00:35:02.120,00:35:02.990
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:35:02.990,00:35:16.350
"PROFESSOR: The question is,
can you see it directly?",00:35:16.350,00:35:19.330
Yeah.,00:35:19.330,00:35:20.160
"And we're going to talk about
that in just one second.",00:35:20.160,00:35:23.820
OK.,00:35:23.820,00:35:30.290
"Now, I'm going to
do one more example",00:35:30.290,00:35:35.500
and illustrate this method.,00:35:35.500,00:35:44.310
Here's another example.,00:35:44.310,00:35:45.405
"The integral of x dx over
the square root of 1 + x^2.",00:35:45.405,00:35:51.430
"Now, here's another example.",00:35:51.430,00:35:56.610
"Now, the method of substitution
leads us to the idea u = 1 +",00:35:56.610,00:36:03.475
x^2.,00:36:03.475,00:36:05.190
"du = 2x dx, etc.",00:36:05.190,00:36:11.540
"It takes about as long as
this other problem did.",00:36:11.540,00:36:14.450
To figure out what's going on.,00:36:14.450,00:36:15.720
"It's a very similar
sort of thing.",00:36:15.720,00:36:17.440
You end up integrating u^(-1/2).,00:36:17.440,00:36:20.870
"It leads to the
integral of u^(-1/2) du.",00:36:20.870,00:36:23.480
"Is everybody seeing
where this...?",00:36:28.350,00:36:31.630
"However, there is a
slightly better method.",00:36:31.630,00:36:37.540
So recommended method.,00:36:37.540,00:36:46.070
"And I call this method
advanced guessing.",00:36:46.070,00:36:59.250
"What advanced guessing
means is that you've",00:36:59.250,00:37:01.077
"done enough of these
problems that you",00:37:01.077,00:37:02.660
can see two steps ahead.,00:37:02.660,00:37:04.750
"And you know what's
going to happen.",00:37:04.750,00:37:08.030
"So the advanced
guessing leads you",00:37:08.030,00:37:10.440
"to believe that here
you had a power -1/2,",00:37:10.440,00:37:12.817
"here you have the
differential of the thing.",00:37:12.817,00:37:14.650
"So it's going to
work out somehow.",00:37:14.650,00:37:16.790
"And the advanced guessing allows
you to guess that the answer",00:37:16.790,00:37:19.670
"should be something like
this. (1 + x^2)^(1/2).",00:37:19.670,00:37:23.520
So this is your advanced guess.,00:37:26.050,00:37:27.800
"And now you just differentiate
it, and see whether it works.",00:37:27.800,00:37:31.670
"Well, here it is.",00:37:31.670,00:37:32.550
"It's 1/2 (1 + x^2)^(-1/2) 2x,
that's the chain rule here.",00:37:32.550,00:37:39.330
"Which, sure enough, gives you
x over square root of 1 + x^2.",00:37:39.330,00:37:44.770
So we're done.,00:37:44.770,00:37:45.480
"And so the answer is square
root of (1 + x^2) + c.",00:37:45.480,00:37:56.960
"Let me illustrate this
further with another example.",00:37:56.960,00:38:02.160
"I strongly recommend
that you do this,",00:38:02.160,00:38:06.010
but you have to get used to it.,00:38:06.010,00:38:09.270
So here's another example.,00:38:09.270,00:38:11.490
e^(6x) dx.,00:38:11.490,00:38:18.900
My advanced guess is e^(6x).,00:38:18.900,00:38:26.360
"And if I check, when
I differentiate it,",00:38:26.360,00:38:30.020
I get 6e^(6x).,00:38:30.020,00:38:33.180
That's the derivative.,00:38:33.180,00:38:35.020
"And so I know that
the answer, so now I",00:38:35.020,00:38:38.030
know what the answer is.,00:38:38.030,00:38:39.030
It's 1/6 e^(6x) + c.,00:38:39.030,00:38:46.300
"Now, OK, you could,
it's also OK, but slow,",00:38:46.300,00:38:54.510
"to use a substitution,
to use u = 6x.",00:38:54.510,00:39:02.550
"Then you're going to get
du = 6dx, dot, dot, dot.",00:39:02.550,00:39:07.920
"It's going to work, it's
just a waste of time.",00:39:07.920,00:39:23.220
"Well, I'm going to give
you a couple more examples.",00:39:23.220,00:39:26.760
So how about this one.,00:39:26.760,00:39:27.910
x e^(-x^2) dx.,00:39:33.560,00:39:35.120
What's the guess?,00:39:41.340,00:39:45.600
Anybody have a guess?,00:39:45.600,00:39:51.270
"Well, you could also correct.",00:39:51.270,00:39:52.480
"So I don't want you to
bother - yeah, go ahead.",00:39:52.480,00:39:54.438
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:54.438,00:39:56.787
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, so you're
already one step ahead of me.",00:39:56.787,00:39:59.120
Because this is too easy.,00:39:59.120,00:40:02.050
"When they get more
complicated, you just",00:40:02.050,00:40:04.110
want to make this guess here.,00:40:04.110,00:40:05.690
"So various people have said
1/2, and they understand",00:40:05.690,00:40:08.884
that there's 1/2 going here.,00:40:08.884,00:40:10.050
"But let me just show
you what happens, OK?",00:40:10.050,00:40:13.890
"If you make this guess
and you differentiate it,",00:40:13.890,00:40:19.140
"what you get here is
e^(-x^2) times the derivative",00:40:19.140,00:40:23.940
"of negative 2x, so that's -2x.",00:40:23.940,00:40:28.130
"x^2, so it's -2x.",00:40:28.130,00:40:30.400
"So now you see that you're off
by a factor of not 2, but -2.",00:40:30.400,00:40:37.970
"So a number of you
were saying that.",00:40:37.970,00:40:39.820
"So the answer is
-1/2 e^(-x^2) + c.",00:40:39.820,00:40:43.120
"And I can guarantee
you, having watched",00:40:46.510,00:40:49.090
"this on various problems, that
people who don't write this out",00:40:49.090,00:40:55.290
make arithmetic mistakes.,00:40:55.290,00:40:57.360
"In other words, there
is a limit to how much",00:40:57.360,00:41:00.140
"people can think ahead
and guess correctly.",00:41:00.140,00:41:02.760
"Another way of doing
it, by the way,",00:41:02.760,00:41:04.760
"is simply to write
this thing in and then",00:41:04.760,00:41:06.680
"fix the coefficient by doing
the differentiation here.",00:41:06.680,00:41:10.160
That's perfectly OK as well.,00:41:10.160,00:41:14.850
"All right, one more example.",00:41:14.850,00:41:18.920
"We're going to integrate
sin x cos x dx.",00:41:18.920,00:41:30.840
"So what's a good
guess for this one?",00:41:30.840,00:41:33.750
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:41:33.750,00:41:36.520
"PROFESSOR: Someone
suggesting sin^2 x.",00:41:36.520,00:41:38.850
So let's try that.,00:41:38.850,00:41:41.490
"Over 2 - well, we'll get the
coefficient in just a second.",00:41:41.490,00:41:45.020
"So sin^2 x, if I differentiate,
I get 2 sin x cos x.",00:41:45.020,00:41:50.970
So that's off by a factor of 2.,00:41:50.970,00:41:53.380
So the answer is 1/2 sin^2 x.,00:41:53.380,00:42:04.540
"But now I want to
point out to you",00:42:04.540,00:42:12.320
"that there's another way
of doing this problem.",00:42:12.320,00:42:17.120
"It's also true that if
you differentiate cos^2 x,",00:42:17.120,00:42:31.240
you get 2 cos x (-sin x).,00:42:31.240,00:42:34.600
"So another answer is that the
integral of sin x cos x dx is",00:42:38.130,00:42:51.030
equal to -1/2 cos^2 x + c.,00:42:51.030,00:43:01.840
So what is going on here?,00:43:01.840,00:43:03.740
What's the problem with this?,00:43:03.740,00:43:06.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:43:06.890,00:43:10.785
PROFESSOR: Pardon me?,00:43:10.785,00:43:11.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:43:11.660,00:43:15.060
"PROFESSOR: Integrals
aren't unique.",00:43:15.060,00:43:18.130
"That's part of the-- but
somehow these two answers still",00:43:18.130,00:43:21.390
have to be the same.,00:43:21.390,00:43:22.320
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:43:22.320,00:43:32.910
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:43:32.910,00:43:35.910
What do you think?,00:43:35.910,00:43:36.660
"STUDENT: If you add them
together, you just get c.",00:43:36.660,00:43:38.743
"PROFESSOR: If you add
them together you get c.",00:43:38.743,00:43:40.900
"Well, actually,
that's almost right.",00:43:40.900,00:43:44.185
"That's not what you
want to do, though.",00:43:44.185,00:43:45.810
You don't want to add them.,00:43:45.810,00:43:47.620
You want to subtract them.,00:43:47.620,00:43:50.930
"So let's see what happens
when you subtract them.",00:43:50.930,00:43:53.750
"I'm going to ignore the
c, for the time being.",00:43:53.750,00:43:56.840
"I get sin^2 x, 1/2 sin^2
x - (-1/2 cos^2 x).",00:43:56.840,00:44:05.520
"So the difference between
them, we hope to be 0.",00:44:05.520,00:44:08.880
"But actually of
course it's not 0.",00:44:08.880,00:44:10.760
"What it is, is it's 1/2 sine
squared plus cosine squared,",00:44:10.760,00:44:17.680
which is 1/2.,00:44:17.680,00:44:18.850
"It's not 0, it's a constant.",00:44:18.850,00:44:24.200
"So what's really going on here
is that these two formulas",00:44:24.200,00:44:27.310
are the same.,00:44:27.310,00:44:29.290
"But you have to understand
how to interpret them.",00:44:29.290,00:44:31.740
"The two constants, here's
a constant up here.",00:44:31.740,00:44:34.450
"There's a constant, c_1
associated to this one.",00:44:34.450,00:44:37.900
"There's a different constant,
c_2 associated to this one.",00:44:37.900,00:44:43.250
"And this family of functions
for all possible c_1's",00:44:43.250,00:44:45.960
"and all possible c_2's, is
the same family of functions.",00:44:45.960,00:44:49.860
"Now, what's the relationship
between c_1 and c_2?",00:44:49.860,00:44:52.940
"Well, if you do the
subtraction, c_1 - c_2",00:44:52.940,00:44:57.210
has to be equal to 1/2.,00:44:57.210,00:44:59.240
"They're both constants,
but they differ by 1/2.",00:44:59.240,00:45:06.610
"So this explains,
when you're dealing",00:45:06.610,00:45:08.404
"with families of things, they
don't have to look the same.",00:45:08.404,00:45:10.820
"And there are lots
of trig functions",00:45:10.820,00:45:12.560
which look a little different.,00:45:12.560,00:45:16.280
"So there can be several formulas
that actually are the same.",00:45:16.280,00:45:19.050
"And it's hard to check that
they're actually the same.",00:45:19.050,00:45:21.960
"You need some trig
identities to do it.",00:45:21.960,00:45:28.950
Let's do one more example here.,00:45:28.950,00:45:55.210
Here's another one.,00:45:55.210,00:46:06.250
"Now, you may be thinking,
and a lot of people",00:46:06.250,00:46:13.510
"are, thinking ugh,
it's got a ln in it.",00:46:13.510,00:46:22.250
"If you're experienced,
you actually",00:46:22.250,00:46:24.400
"can read off the
answer just the way",00:46:24.400,00:46:26.130
"there were several people
who were shouting out",00:46:26.130,00:46:28.088
"the answers when we were doing
the rest of these problems.",00:46:28.088,00:46:31.000
"But, you do need to relax.",00:46:31.000,00:46:32.970
"Because in this case, now
this is definitely not",00:46:32.970,00:46:35.790
"true in general when
we do integrals.",00:46:35.790,00:46:37.490
"But, for now, when
we do integrals,",00:46:37.490,00:46:39.080
they'll all be manageable.,00:46:39.080,00:46:40.570
And there's only one method.,00:46:40.570,00:46:42.670
Which is substitution.,00:46:42.670,00:46:47.390
"And in the substitution
method, you",00:46:47.390,00:46:49.680
"want to go for the
trickiest part.",00:46:49.680,00:46:52.200
And substitute for that.,00:46:52.200,00:46:55.220
"So the substitution
that I proposed",00:46:55.220,00:46:57.630
"to you is that this should
be, u should be ln x.",00:46:57.630,00:47:02.200
"And the advantage that that
has is that its differential",00:47:02.200,00:47:06.270
is simpler than itself.,00:47:06.270,00:47:08.720
So du = dx / x.,00:47:08.720,00:47:15.570
"Remember, we use that in
logarithmic differentiation,",00:47:15.570,00:47:18.500
too.,00:47:18.500,00:47:21.550
"So now we can express this
using this substitution.",00:47:21.550,00:47:28.810
"And what we get is,
the integral of,",00:47:28.810,00:47:32.290
"so I'll divide the
two parts here.",00:47:32.290,00:47:33.990
"It's 1 / ln x, and
then it's dx / x.",00:47:33.990,00:47:36.515
"And this part is 1 /
u, and this part is du.",00:47:36.515,00:47:43.370
So it's the integral of du / u.,00:47:43.370,00:47:49.260
And that is ln u + c.,00:47:49.260,00:47:58.490
"Which altogether, if I put back
in what u is, is ln (ln x) + c.",00:47:58.490,00:48:11.030
"And now we see
some uglier things.",00:48:11.030,00:48:14.290
"In fact, technically
speaking, we",00:48:14.290,00:48:15.900
"could take the
absolute value here.",00:48:15.900,00:48:18.730
"And then this would be
absolute values there.",00:48:18.730,00:48:28.130
"So this is the type of
example where I really",00:48:28.130,00:48:33.090
"would recommend that you
actually use the substitution,",00:48:33.090,00:48:35.740
at least for now.,00:48:35.740,00:48:39.030
"All right, tomorrow
we're going to be",00:48:39.030,00:48:41.820
doing differential equations.,00:48:41.820,00:48:43.080
"And we're going to
review for the test.",00:48:43.080,00:48:45.130
"I'm going to give you a handout
telling you just exactly",00:48:45.130,00:48:47.649
what's going to be on the test.,00:48:47.649,00:48:48.940
"So, see you tomorrow.",00:48:48.940,00:48:52.298
