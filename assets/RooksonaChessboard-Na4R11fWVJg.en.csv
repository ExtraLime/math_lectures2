"Today, we're going to do a fun
problem called rooks on a",00:00:01.970,00:00:06.290
chessboard.,00:00:06.290,00:00:07.720
"And rooks on a chessboard is a
problem that's going to test",00:00:07.720,00:00:11.770
your ability on counting.,00:00:11.770,00:00:15.010
"So hopefully by now in class,
you've learned a few tricks to",00:00:15.010,00:00:19.840
approach counting problems.,00:00:19.840,00:00:21.300
"You've learned about
permutations, you've learned",00:00:21.300,00:00:23.360
"about k-permutations, you've
learned about combinations,",00:00:23.360,00:00:26.690
"and you've learned
about partitions.",00:00:26.690,00:00:29.160
"And historically for students
that we've taught in the past",00:00:29.160,00:00:32.460
"and many people, counting
can be a tricky topic.",00:00:32.460,00:00:36.700
"So this is just one drill
problem to help you get those",00:00:36.700,00:00:40.500
skills under your belt.,00:00:40.500,00:00:43.450
"So what does the rooks on a
chessboard problem ask you?",00:00:43.450,00:00:48.120
"Well, you're given an 8-by-8
chessboard, which I've tried",00:00:48.120,00:00:52.550
to draw here.,00:00:52.550,00:00:54.210
It's not very symmetrical.,00:00:54.210,00:00:55.350
Sorry about that.,00:00:55.350,00:00:57.770
"And you're told that you
have eight rooks.",00:00:57.770,00:01:01.950
"I'm sure most of you guys
are familiar with chess.",00:01:01.950,00:01:04.200
"But if any of you aren't,
chess is a",00:01:04.200,00:01:08.210
sophisticated board game.,00:01:08.210,00:01:09.790
"And one of the types of pieces
you have in this game is",00:01:09.790,00:01:12.780
called a rook.,00:01:12.780,00:01:13.840
"And in this particular problem,",00:01:13.840,00:01:15.450
there are eight rooks.,00:01:15.450,00:01:17.150
"And your job is to place all
eight rooks onto this 8-by-8",00:01:17.150,00:01:21.020
chessboard.,00:01:21.020,00:01:22.380
"Now, you're told in the problem
statement that all",00:01:22.380,00:01:26.880
"placements of rooks are
equally likely.",00:01:26.880,00:01:30.780
"And you are tasked with finding
the probability that",00:01:30.780,00:01:38.030
you get a safe arrangement.,00:01:38.030,00:01:39.630
"So that is to say, you place
your eight rooks on the board.",00:01:39.630,00:01:42.920
"What is the probability
that the way you",00:01:42.920,00:01:44.940
placed them is safe?,00:01:44.940,00:01:47.320
"So what do I mean by ""safe""?",00:01:47.320,00:01:49.160
"Well, if you're familiar with
the way chess works, so if you",00:01:49.160,00:01:55.900
"place a rook here, it can move
vertically or it can move",00:01:55.900,00:01:59.770
horizontally.,00:01:59.770,00:02:00.680
"Those are the only two
legal positions.",00:02:00.680,00:02:03.360
"So if you place a rook here
and you have another piece",00:02:03.360,00:02:07.250
"here, then this is not a safe
arrangement, because the rook",00:02:07.250,00:02:11.430
"can move this way
and kill you.",00:02:11.430,00:02:14.804
"Similarly, if you have a rook
here and another piece here,",00:02:14.804,00:02:18.010
"the rook can move horizontally
and kill you that way.",00:02:18.010,00:02:21.120
"So two rooks on this board are
only safe from each other if",00:02:21.120,00:02:25.870
"they are neither in the same
column nor in the same row.",00:02:25.870,00:02:30.060
"And that's going to be key for
us to solve this problem.",00:02:30.060,00:02:34.200
"So let's see-- where
did my marker go?",00:02:34.200,00:02:37.690
"I've been talking a lot,
and I haven't really",00:02:37.690,00:02:39.410
been writing anything.,00:02:39.410,00:02:40.520
"So our job is again, to find the
probability that you get a",00:02:40.520,00:02:47.050
safe arrangement.,00:02:47.050,00:02:50.100
"So I'm just going to do
""arrange"" for short.",00:02:50.100,00:02:53.570
"Now, I talked about this
previously, and you guys have",00:02:53.570,00:02:56.760
heard it in lecture.,00:02:56.760,00:02:58.550
"Hopefully you remember something
called the discrete",00:02:58.550,00:03:01.250
uniform law.,00:03:01.250,00:03:03.000
"So the discrete uniform law is
applicable when your sample",00:03:03.000,00:03:07.100
"space is discrete and all
outcomes are equally likely.",00:03:07.100,00:03:11.720
"So let's do a quick
check here.",00:03:11.720,00:03:14.480
"What is our sample space
for this problem?",00:03:14.480,00:03:17.500
"Well, a logical choice would
be that the set of all",00:03:17.500,00:03:21.510
"possible outcomes is the set
of all possible spatial",00:03:21.510,00:03:26.070
arrangements of rooks.,00:03:26.070,00:03:28.630
"And hopefully it's clear to
you that that is discrete.",00:03:28.630,00:03:33.140
"And the problem statement
furthermore gives us that",00:03:33.140,00:03:35.510
they're equally likely.,00:03:35.510,00:03:37.080
"So the discrete uniform
law is in fact",00:03:37.080,00:03:39.820
applicable in our setting.,00:03:39.820,00:03:41.430
"So I'm going to go ahead and
write what this means.",00:03:41.430,00:03:45.690
"So when your sample space is
discrete and all outcomes are",00:03:45.690,00:03:50.320
"equally likely, then you can
compute the probability of any",00:03:50.320,00:03:53.740
"event, A, simply by counting
the number of outcomes in A",00:03:53.740,00:03:58.500
"and then dividing it by the
total number of outcomes in",00:03:58.500,00:04:01.310
your sample space.,00:04:01.310,00:04:02.820
"So here we just have to find
the number of total safe",00:04:02.820,00:04:06.500
"arrangements and then divide
it by the total number of",00:04:06.500,00:04:14.680
arrangements.,00:04:14.680,00:04:15.930
 ,00:04:15.930,00:04:17.990
"So again, as you've seen in
other problems, the discrete",00:04:17.990,00:04:21.410
"uniform law is really nice,
because you reduce the problem",00:04:21.410,00:04:24.310
"of computing probabilities to
the problem of counting.",00:04:24.310,00:04:27.970
"And so here's where we're
going to exercise those",00:04:27.970,00:04:29.980
"counting skills, as I
promised earlier.",00:04:29.980,00:04:34.000
"Now, I would like to start
with computing the",00:04:34.000,00:04:37.630
"denominator, or the total
number of arrangements,",00:04:37.630,00:04:40.370
"because I think it's a slightly
easier computation.",00:04:40.370,00:04:44.280
"So we don't care about the
arrangements being safe.",00:04:44.280,00:04:46.775
"We just care about
how many possible",00:04:46.775,00:04:49.700
arrangements are there.,00:04:49.700,00:04:51.760
"Now, again, we have eight rooks,
and we need to place",00:04:51.760,00:04:55.190
all of them.,00:04:55.190,00:04:56.770
And we have this 8-by-8 board.,00:04:56.770,00:04:58.760
"So pretty quickly, you guys
could probably tell me that",00:04:58.760,00:05:02.670
"the total number of square
is 64, because this is",00:05:02.670,00:05:07.340
just 8 times 8.,00:05:07.340,00:05:10.950
"Now, I like to approach
problems sequentially.",00:05:10.950,00:05:16.130
"That sort of really helps me
think clearly about them.",00:05:16.130,00:05:18.490
"So I want you to imagine a
sequential process during",00:05:18.490,00:05:22.330
"which we place each rook
one at a time.",00:05:22.330,00:05:25.270
So pick a rook.,00:05:25.270,00:05:27.340
"The chessboard is
currently empty.",00:05:27.340,00:05:29.450
"So how many squares can you
place that rook in?",00:05:29.450,00:05:35.725
"Well, nobody's on the board.",00:05:35.725,00:05:37.090
You can place it in 64 spots.,00:05:37.090,00:05:39.580
"So for the first rook that you
pick, there are 64 spots.",00:05:39.580,00:05:47.635
 ,00:05:47.635,00:05:50.180
"Now, once you place this rook,
you need to place the second",00:05:50.180,00:05:53.790
"rook, because again, we're
not done until",00:05:53.790,00:05:55.430
all eight are placed.,00:05:55.430,00:05:56.930
"So how many possible
spots are left.",00:05:56.930,00:06:00.650
"Well, I claim that there are 63,
because one rule of chess",00:06:00.650,00:06:04.300
"is that if you put a piece in
a particular square, you can",00:06:04.300,00:06:07.670
"no longer put anything
else on that square.",00:06:07.670,00:06:09.550
"You can't put two
or more things.",00:06:09.550,00:06:12.080
"So the first rook is occupying
one spot, so there's only 63",00:06:12.080,00:06:16.650
spots left.,00:06:16.650,00:06:18.320
"So the second rook has 63 spots
that it could go in.",00:06:18.320,00:06:25.360
"Similarly, the third
rook has 62 spots.",00:06:25.360,00:06:31.680
Hopefully you see the pattern.,00:06:31.680,00:06:33.150
You can continue this down.,00:06:33.150,00:06:34.730
"And remember, we have to
place all eight rooks.",00:06:34.730,00:06:37.310
"So you could do it out
yourself or just",00:06:37.310,00:06:40.330
do the simple math.,00:06:40.330,00:06:42.030
"You'll figure out that the
eighth rook only has 57 spots",00:06:42.030,00:06:46.560
that it could be in.,00:06:46.560,00:06:47.810
 ,00:06:47.810,00:06:51.610
So this is a good start.,00:06:51.610,00:06:53.000
"We've sort of figured out if
we sequentially place each",00:06:53.000,00:06:56.460
"rook, how many options
do we have.",00:06:56.460,00:06:59.330
"But we haven't combined these
numbers in any useful way yet.",00:06:59.330,00:07:03.910
"We haven't counted the number
of total arrangements.",00:07:03.910,00:07:08.265
 ,00:07:08.265,00:07:10.800
"And this may already be obvious
to some, but it wasn't",00:07:10.800,00:07:13.690
"obvious to me when I was first
learning this material, so I",00:07:13.690,00:07:16.130
"want to go through
this slowly.",00:07:16.130,00:07:18.960
"You have probably heard in
lecture by now about the",00:07:18.960,00:07:21.290
counting principle.,00:07:21.290,00:07:22.930
"And what the counting principle
tells you is that",00:07:22.930,00:07:25.820
"whenever you have a process that
is done in stages and in",00:07:25.820,00:07:30.430
"each stage, you have a
particular number of choices,",00:07:30.430,00:07:35.430
"to get the total number of
choices available at the end",00:07:35.430,00:07:38.940
"of the process, you simply
multiply the number of choices",00:07:38.940,00:07:42.420
at each stage.,00:07:42.420,00:07:43.670
 ,00:07:43.670,00:07:45.950
"This might be clear to you,
again, simply from the",00:07:45.950,00:07:48.170
"statement, for some of you.",00:07:48.170,00:07:49.860
"But for others, it might
still not be clear.",00:07:49.860,00:07:51.980
"So let's just take
a simple example.",00:07:51.980,00:07:54.390
"Forget about the rook problem
for a second.",00:07:54.390,00:07:56.870
"Let's say you're at
a deli, and you",00:07:56.870,00:07:59.520
want to make a sandwich.,00:07:59.520,00:08:00.940
"And to make a sandwich, you need
a choice of bread and you",00:08:00.940,00:08:04.510
need a choice of meat.,00:08:04.510,00:08:06.030
"So we have a sandwich-building
process,",00:08:06.030,00:08:08.020
and there's two stages.,00:08:08.020,00:08:09.160
"First, you have to pick the
bread, and then you have to",00:08:09.160,00:08:11.100
pick the meat.,00:08:11.100,00:08:12.260
"So let's say for the choice
of bread, you can",00:08:12.260,00:08:15.270
choose wheat or rye.,00:08:15.270,00:08:18.700
"So again, you can always use
a little decision tree--",00:08:18.700,00:08:22.270
wheat or rye.,00:08:22.270,00:08:24.490
"And then let's say that
for the meats,",00:08:24.490,00:08:26.480
you have three options.,00:08:26.480,00:08:27.840
"You have ham, turkey,
and salami.",00:08:27.840,00:08:31.440
"So you can have ham,
turkey, or salami--",00:08:31.440,00:08:35.460
"ham, turkey, or salami.",00:08:35.460,00:08:40.059
"How many total possible
sandwiches can you make?",00:08:40.059,00:08:43.210
"Well, six.",00:08:43.210,00:08:44.620
"And I got to that
by 2 times 3.",00:08:44.620,00:08:48.320
"And hopefully this makes sense
for you, because there's two",00:08:48.320,00:08:51.130
options in the first stage.,00:08:51.130,00:08:54.220
Freeze an option.,00:08:54.220,00:08:56.090
"Given this choice, there's
three options",00:08:56.090,00:08:58.410
at the second stage.,00:08:58.410,00:09:01.120
"But you have to also realize
that for every other option",00:09:01.120,00:09:06.350
"you have at the first stage, you
have to add an additional",00:09:06.350,00:09:09.450
"three options for the
second stage.",00:09:09.450,00:09:11.770
"And this is the definition
of multiplication.",00:09:11.770,00:09:15.540
"If you add three two times,
you know that's 3 times 2.",00:09:15.540,00:09:19.260
"So if you extrapolate this
example to a larger, more",00:09:19.260,00:09:22.990
"general picture, you will have
derived for yourself the",00:09:22.990,00:09:26.620
counting principle.,00:09:26.620,00:09:28.860
"And we're going to use the
counting principle here to",00:09:28.860,00:09:33.800
"determine what the total number
of arrangements are.",00:09:33.800,00:09:36.970
"So we have a sequential process,
because we're placing",00:09:36.970,00:09:40.650
"the first rook and then the
second rook, et cetera.",00:09:40.650,00:09:43.340
"So at the first stage,
we have 64 choices.",00:09:43.340,00:09:48.810
"At the second stage,
we have 63 choices.",00:09:48.810,00:09:53.550
"At the third stage, we have
62 choices, et cetera.",00:09:53.550,00:09:57.610
"And so I'm just multiplying
these numbers together,",00:09:57.610,00:10:01.000
"because the counting principle
says I can do this.",00:10:01.000,00:10:04.220
"So my claim is that this product
is equal to the total",00:10:04.220,00:10:10.320
number of arrangements.,00:10:10.320,00:10:13.580
"And we could stop here, but I'm
going to actually write",00:10:13.580,00:10:17.540
this in a more useful way.,00:10:17.540,00:10:20.160
"You guys should have
been introduced to",00:10:20.160,00:10:22.920
the factorial function.,00:10:22.920,00:10:24.510
"So you can express this
equivalently as 64 factorial",00:10:24.510,00:10:29.800
divided by 56 factorial.,00:10:29.800,00:10:32.530
"And this is not necessary for
your problem solution, but",00:10:32.530,00:10:36.190
"sometimes it's helpful to
express these types of",00:10:36.190,00:10:38.340
"products in factorials,
because you can see",00:10:38.340,00:10:41.170
cancellations more easily.,00:10:41.170,00:10:44.210
"So if it's OK with everybody,
I'm going to erase this work",00:10:44.210,00:10:48.300
to give myself more room.,00:10:48.300,00:10:51.580
"So we'll just put our answer for
the denominator up here,",00:10:51.580,00:10:56.310
"and then we're going to get
started on the numerator.",00:10:56.310,00:11:00.230
"So for the numerator, thanks to
the discrete uniform law,",00:11:00.230,00:11:04.170
"we only need to count the number
of safe arrangements.",00:11:04.170,00:11:09.410
"But this is a little bit more
tricky, because now, we have",00:11:09.410,00:11:12.100
"to apply our definition
of what ""safe"" means.",00:11:12.100,00:11:15.420
"But we're going to use the same
higher-level strategy,",00:11:15.420,00:11:18.440
"which is realizing that we can
place rooks sequentially.",00:11:18.440,00:11:22.510
"So we can think of it as
a sequential process.",00:11:22.510,00:11:25.810
"And then if we figure out how
many choices you have in each",00:11:25.810,00:11:29.940
"stage that sort of maintain the
""safeness"" of the setup,",00:11:29.940,00:11:35.040
"then you can use the counting
principle to multiply all",00:11:35.040,00:11:37.680
"those numbers together
and get your answer.",00:11:37.680,00:11:41.250
"So we have to place
eight rooks.",00:11:41.250,00:11:45.060
"Starting the same way we did
last time, how many spots are",00:11:45.060,00:11:49.210
"there for the first rook
that are safe?",00:11:49.210,00:11:52.880
"Nobody is on the board yet, so
nobody can harm the first rook",00:11:52.880,00:11:56.520
we put down.,00:11:56.520,00:11:57.500
"So I claim that it's just
our total of 64.",00:11:57.500,00:12:01.940
"Now, let's see what happens.",00:12:01.940,00:12:04.050
"Let's pick a random
square in here.",00:12:04.050,00:12:05.740
"Let's say we put our
first rook here.",00:12:05.740,00:12:08.520
"Now, I claim a bunch of spots
get invalidated because of the",00:12:08.520,00:12:13.210
rules of chess.,00:12:13.210,00:12:14.390
"So before, I told you a rook can
kill anything in the same",00:12:14.390,00:12:18.570
column or in the same row.,00:12:18.570,00:12:20.680
"So you can't put a rook here,
because they'll kill each",00:12:20.680,00:12:25.020
"other, and you can't
put a rook here.",00:12:25.020,00:12:27.250
"So by extension, you can see
that everything in the column",00:12:27.250,00:12:33.250
"and the row that I'm
highlighting in blue, it's no",00:12:33.250,00:12:36.970
longer an option.,00:12:36.970,00:12:37.850
"You can't place a
rook in there.",00:12:37.850,00:12:39.880
"Otherwise, we will
have violated",00:12:39.880,00:12:41.780
"our ""safety"" principle.",00:12:41.780,00:12:45.140
"So where can our
second rook go?",00:12:45.140,00:12:50.580
"Well, our second rook can go in
any of the blank spots, any",00:12:50.580,00:12:55.140
"of the spots that are not
highlighted by blue.",00:12:55.140,00:12:57.630
"And let's stare at this
a little bit.",00:12:57.630,00:13:00.110
 ,00:13:00.110,00:13:02.640
"Imagine that you were to take
scissors to your chessboard",00:13:02.640,00:13:06.560
"and cut along this line
and this line and this",00:13:06.560,00:13:09.370
line and this line.,00:13:09.370,00:13:10.200
"So you essentially sawed off
this cross that we created.",00:13:10.200,00:13:14.190
"Then you would have four
free-floating chessboard",00:13:14.190,00:13:18.470
"pieces-- this one, this one,
this one, and this one.",00:13:18.470,00:13:23.070
"So this is a 3-by-4 piece,
this is 3-by-3, this is",00:13:23.070,00:13:27.650
"4-by-3, and this is 4-by-4.",00:13:27.650,00:13:30.020
"Well, because you cut this part
out, you can now slide",00:13:30.020,00:13:33.600
those pieces back together.,00:13:33.600,00:13:36.000
"And hopefully you can convince
yourself that that would leave",00:13:36.000,00:13:39.950
you with a 7-by-7 chessboard.,00:13:39.950,00:13:43.390
"And you can see that the
dimensions match up here.",00:13:43.390,00:13:48.650
"So essentially, the second rook
can be placed anywhere in",00:13:48.650,00:13:53.000
"the remaining 7-by-7
chessboard.",00:13:53.000,00:13:55.970
"And of course, there are 49
spots in a 7-by-7 chessboard.",00:13:55.970,00:14:00.280
So you get 49.,00:14:00.280,00:14:03.430
"So let's do this experiment
again.",00:14:03.430,00:14:07.150
"Let me rewrite the reduced
7-by-7 chessboard.",00:14:07.150,00:14:11.860
"You're going to have to forgive
me if the lines are",00:14:11.860,00:14:14.540
not perfect--,00:14:14.540,00:14:16.680
"one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven; one, two, three,",00:14:16.680,00:14:22.760
"four, five, six, seven.",00:14:22.760,00:14:23.210
"Yep, I did that right.",00:14:23.210,00:14:24.630
"And then we have one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.",00:14:24.630,00:14:32.030
"That's not too bad for
my first attempt.",00:14:32.030,00:14:36.800
"So again, how did I get this
chessboard from this one?",00:14:36.800,00:14:39.980
"Well, I took scissors and I cut
off of the blue strips,",00:14:39.980,00:14:43.210
"and then I just merged the
remaining four pieces.",00:14:43.210,00:14:46.690
"So now, I'm placing
my second rook.",00:14:46.690,00:14:50.160
"So I know that I can place my
second rook in any of these",00:14:50.160,00:14:54.350
"squares, and it'll be
safe from this rook.",00:14:54.350,00:14:58.770
"Of course, in reality, you
wouldn't really cut up your",00:14:58.770,00:15:00.830
chessboard.,00:15:00.830,00:15:01.390
"I'm just using this as a visual
aid to help you guys",00:15:01.390,00:15:05.470
see why there are 49 spots.,00:15:05.470,00:15:08.220
"Another way you could see 49
spots is literally just by",00:15:08.220,00:15:11.020
"counting all the white squares,
but I think it takes",00:15:11.020,00:15:15.890
time to count 49 squares.,00:15:15.890,00:15:17.720
"And this is a faster
way of seeing it.",00:15:17.720,00:15:20.501
"So you can put your second
rook anywhere here.",00:15:20.501,00:15:23.930
"Let's actually put in the
corner, because the corner is",00:15:23.930,00:15:26.340
a nice case.,00:15:26.340,00:15:27.590
"If you put your rook in the
corner, immediately, all the",00:15:27.590,00:15:30.700
"spots in here and all the spots
in here become invalid",00:15:30.700,00:15:35.360
"for the third rook, because
otherwise, the rooks can hurt",00:15:35.360,00:15:38.230
each other.,00:15:38.230,00:15:40.070
"So again, you'll see that if you
take scissors and cut off",00:15:40.070,00:15:45.130
"the blue part, you will have
reduced the dimension of the",00:15:45.130,00:15:47.940
chessboard again.,00:15:47.940,00:15:49.730
"And you can see pretty quickly
that what you're left with is",00:15:49.730,00:15:52.820
a 6-by-6 chessboard.,00:15:52.820,00:15:55.100
"So for the third rook, you get a
6-by-6 chessboard, which has",00:15:55.100,00:16:02.820
36 free spots.,00:16:02.820,00:16:06.020
"And I'm not going to insult
your intelligence.",00:16:06.020,00:16:08.880
You guys can see the pattern--,00:16:08.880,00:16:11.280
"64, 49, 36.",00:16:11.280,00:16:13.130
"These are just perfect
squares decreasing.",00:16:13.130,00:16:16.310
"So you know that the fourth
rook will have 25 spots.",00:16:16.310,00:16:21.740
"I'm going to come over here
because I'm out of room.",00:16:21.740,00:16:24.840
"The fifth rook will
have 16 spots.",00:16:24.840,00:16:27.970
"The sixth rook will
have nine spots.",00:16:27.970,00:16:31.230
"The seventh rook will
have four spots.",00:16:31.230,00:16:33.900
"And the eighth rook will
just have one spot.",00:16:33.900,00:16:37.780
"And now, here we're going
to invoke the",00:16:37.780,00:16:39.360
counting principle again.,00:16:39.360,00:16:40.880
"Remember the thing that I just
defined to you by talking",00:16:40.880,00:16:43.930
about sandwiches.,00:16:43.930,00:16:46.680
"And we'll see that to get
the total number of safe",00:16:46.680,00:16:49.240
"arrangements, we can
just multiply",00:16:49.240,00:16:50.860
these numbers together.,00:16:50.860,00:16:52.910
"So I'm going to go ahead
and put that up here.",00:16:52.910,00:16:54.750
"You get 64 times 49 times
36 times 25 times 16",00:16:54.750,00:17:02.360
times 9 times 4.,00:17:02.360,00:17:05.079
"And in fact, this
is our answer.",00:17:05.079,00:17:07.810
So we're all done.,00:17:07.810,00:17:10.859
"So I really like this problem,
because we don't normally ask",00:17:10.859,00:17:15.630
"you to think about different
spatial arrangements.",00:17:15.630,00:17:18.690
"So it's a nice exercise, because
it lets you practice",00:17:18.690,00:17:22.339
"your counting skills in a
new and creative way.",00:17:22.339,00:17:27.069
"And in particular, the thing
that we've been using for a",00:17:27.069,00:17:31.220
"while now is the discrete
uniform law.",00:17:31.220,00:17:33.730
"But now, I also introduced
the counting principle.",00:17:33.730,00:17:36.730
"And we used the counting
principle twice--",00:17:36.730,00:17:39.310
"once to compute the numerator
and once to compute the",00:17:39.310,00:17:41.910
denominator.,00:17:41.910,00:17:44.210
"Counting can take a long time
for you to absorb it.",00:17:44.210,00:17:49.480
"So if you still don't totally
buy the counting",00:17:49.480,00:17:52.850
"principle, that's OK.",00:17:52.850,00:17:54.450
"I just recommend you do some
more examples and try to",00:17:54.450,00:17:59.440
"convince yourself that it's
really counting the right",00:17:59.440,00:18:02.280
number of things.,00:18:02.280,00:18:04.020
"So counting principle is
the second takeaway.",00:18:04.020,00:18:07.510
"And then the other thing that
is just worth mentioning is,",00:18:07.510,00:18:10.520
"you guys should get really
comfortable with these",00:18:10.520,00:18:12.980
"factorials, because they will
just show up again and again.",00:18:12.980,00:18:19.960
"So that's the end of the
problem, and I'll",00:18:19.960,00:18:21.960
see you next time.,00:18:21.960,00:18:23.210
 ,00:18:23.210,00:18:27.134
