"PROFESSOR: Well, because
our subject today",00:00:21.840,00:00:25.190
"is trig integrals
and substitutions,",00:00:25.190,00:00:28.280
"Professor Jerison called in his
substitute teacher for today.",00:00:28.280,00:00:33.640
That's me.,00:00:33.640,00:00:46.150
Professor Miller.,00:00:46.150,00:00:49.860
"And I'm going to try to tell
you about trig substitutions",00:00:49.860,00:00:52.790
and trig integrals.,00:00:52.790,00:00:54.610
"And I'll be here tomorrow to
do more of the same, as well.",00:00:54.610,00:00:59.650
"So, this is about trigonometry,
and maybe first thing I'll do",00:00:59.650,00:01:02.320
"is remind you of some basic
things about trigonometry.",00:01:02.320,00:01:24.180
"So, if I have a
circle, trigonometry",00:01:24.180,00:01:27.110
"is all based on the
circle of radius 1",00:01:27.110,00:01:29.730
and centered at the origin.,00:01:29.730,00:01:32.000
"And so if this is an angle
of theta, up from the x-axis,",00:01:32.000,00:01:34.870
"then the coordinates
of this point",00:01:34.870,00:01:36.350
are cosine theta and sine theta.,00:01:36.350,00:01:39.550
"And so that leads right away
to some trig identities,",00:01:39.550,00:01:42.090
which you know very well.,00:01:42.090,00:01:43.330
"But I'm going to put them up
here because we'll use them",00:01:43.330,00:01:46.820
over and over again today.,00:01:46.820,00:01:51.220
"Remember the convention sin^2
theta secretly means (sin",00:01:51.220,00:01:55.220
theta)^2.,00:01:55.220,00:01:57.530
"It would be more
sensible to write",00:01:57.530,00:01:59.040
"a parenthesis around
the sine of theta",00:01:59.040,00:02:01.600
and then say you square that.,00:02:01.600,00:02:03.350
"But everybody in the world puts
the 2 up there over the sin,",00:02:03.350,00:02:06.380
and so I'll do that too.,00:02:06.380,00:02:09.080
"So that follows just because
the circle has radius 1.",00:02:09.080,00:02:11.995
"But then there are some
other identities too,",00:02:11.995,00:02:13.870
which I think you remember.,00:02:13.870,00:02:15.410
"I'll write them down
here. cos(2theta),",00:02:15.410,00:02:19.170
"there's this double angle
formula that says cos(2theta) =",00:02:19.170,00:02:22.490
cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).,00:02:22.490,00:02:23.840
"And there's also the
double angle formula",00:02:29.090,00:02:31.000
for the sin(2theta).,00:02:31.000,00:02:34.620
Remember what that says?,00:02:34.620,00:02:38.480
2 sin(theta) cos(theta).,00:02:38.480,00:02:41.300
"I'm going to use
these trig identities",00:02:46.437,00:02:48.020
"and I'm going to use them
in a slightly different way.",00:02:48.020,00:02:50.370
"And so I'd like to pay a little
more attention to this one",00:02:50.370,00:02:53.090
"and get a different way
of writing this one out.",00:02:53.090,00:02:57.120
"So this is actually
the half angle formula.",00:02:57.120,00:03:06.930
"And that says, I'm going to
try to express the cos(theta)",00:03:06.930,00:03:14.170
in terms of the cos(2theta).,00:03:14.170,00:03:16.400
"So if I know the
cos(2theta), I want",00:03:16.400,00:03:19.590
"to try to express the
cos theta in terms of it.",00:03:19.590,00:03:23.320
"Well, I'll start with a
cos(2theta) and play with that.",00:03:23.320,00:03:30.130
OK.,00:03:30.130,00:03:30.630
"Well, we know what this is, it's
cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).",00:03:30.630,00:03:36.600
"But we also know what the
sin^2(theta) is in terms",00:03:36.600,00:03:39.520
of the cosine.,00:03:39.520,00:03:40.250
"So I can eliminate the
sin^2 from this picture.",00:03:40.250,00:03:44.630
"So this is equal to cos^2(theta)
minus the quantity 1 -",00:03:44.630,00:03:48.400
cos^2(theta).,00:03:48.400,00:03:50.650
"I put in what sin^2 is in
terms of cos^2 And so that's 2",00:03:50.650,00:03:57.510
cos^2(theta) - 1.,00:03:57.510,00:03:59.940
"There's this cos^2,
which gets a plus sign.",00:03:59.940,00:04:02.240
"Because of these
two minus signs.",00:04:02.240,00:04:04.540
"And there's the one
that was there before,",00:04:04.540,00:04:06.290
"so altogether there
are two of them.",00:04:06.290,00:04:10.270
"I want to isolate
what cosine is.",00:04:10.270,00:04:12.380
"Or rather, what cos^2 is.",00:04:12.380,00:04:16.070
So let's solve for that.,00:04:16.070,00:04:17.680
"So I'll put the 1
on the other side.",00:04:17.680,00:04:20.120
And I get 1 + cos(2theta).,00:04:20.120,00:04:24.120
"And then, I want to divide by
this 2, and so that puts a 2",00:04:24.120,00:04:27.910
in this denominator here.,00:04:27.910,00:04:30.280
"So some people call that
the half angle formula.",00:04:30.280,00:04:33.280
"What it really is for us is
it's a way of eliminating powers",00:04:33.280,00:04:36.730
from sines and cosines.,00:04:36.730,00:04:38.800
"I've gotten rid of this
square at the expense",00:04:38.800,00:04:41.290
of putting in a 2theta here.,00:04:41.290,00:04:43.720
We'll use that.,00:04:43.720,00:04:45.260
"And, similarly, same calculation
shows that sin^2(theta) = (1 -",00:04:45.260,00:04:51.022
cos(2theta)) / 2.,00:04:51.022,00:04:51.730
"Same cosine, in that formula
also, but it has a minus sign.",00:04:55.850,00:05:01.480
For the sin^2.,00:05:01.480,00:05:03.640
"OK. so that's my little
review of trig identities",00:05:03.640,00:05:07.860
"that we'll make use of
as this lecture goes on.",00:05:07.860,00:05:14.620
"I want to talk about trig
identity-- trig integrals,",00:05:14.620,00:05:17.720
"and you know some trig
integrals, I'm sure, already.",00:05:17.720,00:05:23.500
"Like, well, let me write
the differential form first.",00:05:23.500,00:05:26.740
"You know that d sin
theta, or maybe I'll",00:05:26.740,00:05:30.400
"say d sin x, is,
let's see, that's",00:05:30.400,00:05:35.620
"the derivative of sin
x times dx, right.",00:05:35.620,00:05:39.030
"The derivative of
sin x is cos x, dx.",00:05:39.030,00:05:46.120
"And so if I integrate both sides
here, the integral form of this",00:05:46.120,00:05:50.080
is the integral of cos x dx.,00:05:50.080,00:05:55.390
Is sin x plus a constant.,00:05:55.390,00:05:59.850
"And in the same way,
d cos x = -sin x dx.",00:05:59.850,00:06:07.410
"Right, the derivative of
the cosine is minus sine.",00:06:07.410,00:06:10.320
"And when I integrate that, I
find the integral of sin x dx",00:06:10.320,00:06:15.330
is -cos x + c.,00:06:15.330,00:06:21.140
So that's our starting point.,00:06:21.140,00:06:22.820
"And the game today, for the
first half of the lecture,",00:06:22.820,00:06:27.510
"is to use that basic-- just
those basic integration",00:06:27.510,00:06:33.550
"formulas, together with
clever use of trig identities",00:06:33.550,00:06:37.710
"in order to compute more
complicated formulas involving",00:06:37.710,00:06:41.260
trig functions.,00:06:41.260,00:06:42.820
"So the first thing,
the first topic,",00:06:42.820,00:06:47.040
"is to think about integrals of
the form sin^n (x) cos^n (x)",00:06:47.040,00:06:52.250
dx.,00:06:52.250,00:06:52.750
"Where here I have in mind m and
n are non-negative integers.",00:06:56.190,00:07:04.070
So let's try to integrate these.,00:07:04.070,00:07:05.950
"I'll show you some applications
of these pretty soon.",00:07:05.950,00:07:09.640
"Looking down the
road a little bit,",00:07:09.640,00:07:11.250
"integrals like this show
up in Fourier series",00:07:11.250,00:07:14.050
"and many other subjects
in mathematics.",00:07:14.050,00:07:16.190
"It turns out they're quite
important to be able to do.",00:07:16.190,00:07:20.000
"So that's why we're
doing them now.",00:07:20.000,00:07:23.860
"Well, so there are two
cases to think about here.",00:07:23.860,00:07:29.690
"When you're integrating
things like this.",00:07:29.690,00:07:32.070
"There's the easy case, and
let's do that one first.",00:07:32.070,00:07:35.890
"The easy case is when at
least one exponent is odd.",00:07:35.890,00:07:49.495
That's the easy case.,00:07:49.495,00:07:50.370
"So, for example, suppose
that I wanted to integrate,",00:07:50.370,00:07:55.870
"well, let's take the case m = 1.",00:07:55.870,00:08:02.560
"So I'm integrating
sin^n (x) cos x dx.",00:08:02.560,00:08:09.530
"I'm taking-- Oh, I
could do that one.",00:08:09.530,00:08:17.050
"Let's see if that's
what I want to take.",00:08:17.050,00:08:23.600
Yeah.,00:08:23.600,00:08:27.540
"My confusion is that I meant
to have this a different power.",00:08:27.540,00:08:30.590
You were thinking that.,00:08:30.590,00:08:34.750
"So let's do this
case when m = 1.",00:08:34.750,00:08:36.670
"So the integral I'm
trying to do is any power",00:08:36.670,00:08:38.680
of the sine times the cosine.,00:08:38.680,00:08:41.450
"Well, here's the trick.",00:08:41.450,00:08:44.520
"Recognize, use this
formula up at the top",00:08:44.520,00:08:48.920
"there to see cos x dx as
something that we already",00:08:48.920,00:08:53.570
have on the blackboard.,00:08:53.570,00:08:55.670
"So, the way to exploit that
is to make a substitution.",00:08:55.670,00:08:59.570
"And substitution is
going to be u = sin x.",00:08:59.570,00:09:08.320
And here's why.,00:09:08.320,00:09:09.610
"Then this integral that I'm
trying to do is the integral",00:09:09.610,00:09:12.820
"of u^n, that's already
a simplification.",00:09:12.820,00:09:18.760
And then there's that cos x dx.,00:09:18.760,00:09:22.160
"When you make a substitution,
you've got to go all the way",00:09:22.160,00:09:25.120
"and replace everything
in the expression",00:09:25.120,00:09:27.970
"by things involving this new
variable that I've introduced.",00:09:27.970,00:09:33.000
"So I'd better get
rid of the cos x dx",00:09:33.000,00:09:35.390
"and rewrite it in terms
of du or in terms of u.",00:09:35.390,00:09:39.140
"And I can do that because du,
according to that formula,",00:09:39.140,00:09:45.290
is cos x dx.,00:09:45.290,00:09:50.600
Let me put a box around that.,00:09:50.600,00:09:53.810
That's our substitution.,00:09:53.810,00:09:55.800
"When you make a
substitution, you also",00:09:55.800,00:09:57.500
"want to compute the
differential of the variable",00:09:57.500,00:10:00.740
that you substitute in.,00:10:00.740,00:10:03.100
"So the cos x dx that appears
here is just, exactly, du.",00:10:03.100,00:10:08.800
"And I've replaced this trig
integral with something",00:10:08.800,00:10:11.500
"that doesn't involve
trig functions at all.",00:10:11.500,00:10:13.330
This is a lot easier.,00:10:13.330,00:10:14.240
"We can just plug into
what we know here.",00:10:14.240,00:10:17.420
"This is u^(n+1) /
(n+1) plus a constant,",00:10:17.420,00:10:23.640
and I've done the integral.,00:10:23.640,00:10:26.620
"But I'm not quite done
with the problem yet.",00:10:26.620,00:10:29.580
"Because to be nice to your
reader and to yourself,",00:10:29.580,00:10:34.310
"you should go back at
this point, probably,",00:10:34.310,00:10:36.560
"go back and get rid of this new
variable that you introduced.",00:10:36.560,00:10:40.399
"You're the one who introduced
this variable, you.",00:10:40.399,00:10:42.440
"Nobody except you,
really, knows what it is.",00:10:42.440,00:10:45.950
"But the rest of the
world knows what",00:10:45.950,00:10:48.080
"they asked for the first
place that involved x.",00:10:48.080,00:10:51.360
"So I have to go back
and get rid of this.",00:10:51.360,00:10:53.460
"And that's not hard to do in
this case, because u = sin x.",00:10:53.460,00:10:57.830
"And so I make this
back substitution.",00:10:57.830,00:11:04.390
And that's what you get.,00:11:04.390,00:11:05.820
So there's the answer.,00:11:05.820,00:11:11.040
"OK, so the game was, I use this
odd power of the cosine here,",00:11:11.040,00:11:15.930
"and I could see it appearing as
the differential of the sine.",00:11:15.930,00:11:19.180
"So that's what made
this substitution work.",00:11:19.180,00:11:22.470
"Let's do another example
to see how that works out",00:11:22.470,00:11:25.060
in a slightly different case.,00:11:25.060,00:11:36.490
So here's another example.,00:11:36.490,00:11:48.420
Now I do have an odd power.,00:11:48.420,00:11:50.050
"One of the exponents is odd,
so I'm in the easy case.",00:11:50.050,00:11:53.800
But it's not 1.,00:11:53.800,00:11:56.310
"The game now is to
use this trig identity",00:11:56.310,00:12:05.590
"to get rid of the largest
even power that you can,",00:12:05.590,00:12:10.500
from this odd power here.,00:12:10.500,00:12:13.870
"So use sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x, to
eliminate a lot of powers from",00:12:13.870,00:12:24.710
that odd power.,00:12:24.710,00:12:26.220
Watch what happens.,00:12:26.220,00:12:28.370
"So this is not really a
substitution or anything,",00:12:28.370,00:12:31.490
this is just a trig identity.,00:12:31.490,00:12:34.320
"This sine cubed is sine
squared times the sine.",00:12:34.320,00:12:38.130
"And the sine squared
is 1 - cos^2 x.",00:12:38.130,00:12:41.360
"And then I have the
remaining sin x.",00:12:41.360,00:12:43.770
And then I have cos^2 x dx.,00:12:43.770,00:12:48.970
"So let me rewrite that a little
bit to see how this works out.",00:12:48.970,00:12:53.580
"This is the integral
of cos^2 x minus,",00:12:53.580,00:12:59.490
"and then there's the
product of these two.",00:12:59.490,00:13:01.240
That's cos^4 x times sin x dx.,00:13:01.240,00:13:09.370
"So now I'm really
exactly in the situation",00:13:09.370,00:13:12.200
that I was in over here.,00:13:12.200,00:13:13.700
"I've got a single power
of a sine or cosine.",00:13:13.700,00:13:17.570
"It happens that
it's a sine here.",00:13:17.570,00:13:20.060
"But that's not going
to cause any trouble,",00:13:20.060,00:13:21.960
"we can go ahead and play the
same game that I did there.",00:13:21.960,00:13:26.290
"So, so far I've just been
using trig identities.",00:13:26.290,00:13:28.860
"But now I'll use a
trig substitution.",00:13:28.860,00:13:41.770
"And I think I want to write
these as powers of a variable.",00:13:41.770,00:13:45.335
"And then this is going to be the
differential of that variable.",00:13:45.335,00:13:47.960
"So I'll take u to be cos x, and
that means that du = -sin x dx.",00:13:47.960,00:13:58.190
There's the substitution.,00:13:58.190,00:14:04.950
"So when I make that
substitution, what do we get.",00:14:04.950,00:14:09.550
Cosine squared becomes u^2.,00:14:09.550,00:14:11.710
"Cosine to the 4th becomes u^4,
and sin x dx becomes not quite",00:14:15.470,00:14:23.150
"du, watch for the signum,
watch for this minus sign here.",00:14:23.150,00:14:27.570
It becomes -du.,00:14:27.570,00:14:32.100
But that's OK.,00:14:32.100,00:14:32.820
The minus sign comes outside.,00:14:32.820,00:14:34.720
"And I can integrate
both of these powers,",00:14:34.720,00:14:36.860
so I get -u^3 / 3.,00:14:36.860,00:14:43.540
"And then this 4th power gives me
a 5th power, when I integrate.",00:14:43.540,00:14:48.950
And don't forget the constant.,00:14:48.950,00:14:53.390
Am I done?,00:14:53.390,00:14:55.100
Not quite done.,00:14:55.100,00:14:55.850
"I have to back
substitute and get rid",00:14:55.850,00:14:57.690
"of my choice of variable, u,
and replace it with yours.",00:14:57.690,00:15:00.830
Questions?,00:15:00.830,00:15:01.330
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:15:01.330,00:15:06.049
PROFESSOR: There should indeed.,00:15:06.049,00:15:07.340
"I forgot this minus sign
when I came down here.",00:15:07.340,00:15:10.190
"So these two gang up
to give me a plus.",00:15:10.190,00:15:12.690
"Was that what the other
question was about, too?",00:15:12.690,00:15:14.960
Thanks.,00:15:14.960,00:15:16.720
So let's back substitute.,00:15:16.720,00:15:18.030
"And I'm going to
put that over here.",00:15:18.030,00:15:23.900
"And the result is, well, I just
replace the u by cosine of x.",00:15:23.900,00:15:27.920
"So this is - -cos^3(x) / 3 plus,
thank you, cos^5(x) / 5 + c.",00:15:27.920,00:15:38.160
And there's the answer.,00:15:38.160,00:15:44.670
"By the way, you can remember
one of the nice things",00:15:44.670,00:15:47.210
"about doing an
integral is it's fairly",00:15:47.210,00:15:49.160
easy to check your answer.,00:15:49.160,00:15:51.280
"You can always differentiate
the thing you get,",00:15:51.280,00:15:53.680
"and see whether you get the
right thing when you go back.",00:15:53.680,00:15:56.890
"It's not too hard
to use the power",00:15:56.890,00:15:59.280
"rules and the
differentiation rule",00:15:59.280,00:16:02.500
"for the cosine to get
back to this if you",00:16:02.500,00:16:06.080
want to check the work.,00:16:06.080,00:16:09.350
"Let's do one more
example, just to handle",00:16:09.350,00:16:12.830
"an example of this
easy case, which you",00:16:12.830,00:16:15.980
might have thought of at first.,00:16:15.980,00:16:18.490
"Suppose I just want to
integrate a cube. sin^3 x.",00:16:18.490,00:16:22.720
No cosine in sight.,00:16:29.320,00:16:32.040
"But I do have an
odd power of a trig",00:16:32.040,00:16:35.780
"function, of a sine or cosine.",00:16:35.780,00:16:37.180
So I'm in the easy case.,00:16:37.180,00:16:39.020
"And the procedure that I was
suggesting says I want to take",00:16:39.020,00:16:44.740
"out the largest even power
that I can, from the sin^3.",00:16:44.740,00:16:48.700
"So I'll take that out, that's
a sin^2, and write it as 1 -",00:16:48.700,00:16:52.870
cos^2.,00:16:52.870,00:16:53.370
"Well, now I'm very happy.",00:16:57.020,00:16:58.380
"Because it's just
like the situation",00:16:58.380,00:17:00.470
"we had somewhere
on the board here.",00:17:00.470,00:17:06.017
"It's just like the
situation we had up here.",00:17:06.017,00:17:07.850
"I've got a power of a
cosine times sin x dx.",00:17:07.850,00:17:11.660
"So exactly the same
substitution steps in.",00:17:11.660,00:17:16.310
"You get, and maybe
you can see what",00:17:16.310,00:17:19.070
happens without doing the work.,00:17:19.070,00:17:20.860
Shall I do the work here?,00:17:20.860,00:17:22.630
I make the same substitution.,00:17:22.630,00:17:24.450
"And so this is (1 - u
(1 - u^2) times -du.",00:17:24.450,00:17:30.680
Which is u - u^3 / 3.,00:17:33.540,00:17:40.050
"But then I want to put
this minus sign in place,",00:17:40.050,00:17:42.050
"and so that gives me -u +
u^3 / 3 plus a constant.",00:17:42.050,00:17:47.700
"And then I back substitute
and get cos x + cos^3 x / 3.",00:17:47.700,00:17:58.090
So this is the easy case.,00:17:58.090,00:17:59.350
"If you have some odd
power to play with,",00:17:59.350,00:18:02.190
"then you can make use of it and
it's pretty straightforward.",00:18:02.190,00:18:07.990
"OK the harder case is when
you don't have an odd power.",00:18:07.990,00:18:10.680
So what's the program?,00:18:10.680,00:18:11.610
"I'm going to do the
harder case, and then I'm",00:18:11.610,00:18:13.770
"going to show you an example of
how to integrate square roots.",00:18:13.770,00:18:19.340
"And do an application, using
these ideas from trigonometry.",00:18:19.340,00:18:26.260
"So I want to keep
this blackboard.",00:18:26.260,00:18:30.250
"Maybe I'll come back
and start here again.",00:18:30.250,00:18:34.470
"So the harder case is when
they're only even exponents.",00:18:34.470,00:18:55.240
"I'm still trying to
integrate the same form.",00:18:55.240,00:18:58.190
"But now all the
exponents are even.",00:18:58.190,00:19:00.370
So we have to do some game.,00:19:00.370,00:19:03.510
"And here the game is use
the half angle formula.",00:19:03.510,00:19:10.400
"Which I just erased, very
sadly, on the board here.",00:19:10.400,00:19:16.455
"Maybe I'll rewrite
them over here",00:19:16.455,00:19:17.830
so we have them on the board.,00:19:17.830,00:19:23.550
"I think I remember
what they were.",00:19:23.550,00:19:44.270
"So the game is I'm going
to use that half angle",00:19:44.270,00:19:46.300
"formula to start getting
rid of those even powers.",00:19:46.300,00:19:50.180
"Half angle formula written like
this, exactly, talks about-- it",00:19:50.180,00:19:54.510
"rewrites even powers
of sines and cosines.",00:19:54.510,00:19:57.790
"So let's see how that
works out in an example.",00:19:57.790,00:20:00.950
"How about just the cosine
squared for a start.",00:20:00.950,00:20:08.880
What to do?,00:20:08.880,00:20:09.700
I can't pull anything out.,00:20:09.700,00:20:11.970
"I could rewrite
this as 1 - sin^2,",00:20:11.970,00:20:15.180
"but then I'd be faced with
integrating the sin^2,",00:20:15.180,00:20:17.290
which is exactly as hard.,00:20:17.290,00:20:19.480
"So instead, let's use
this formula here.",00:20:19.480,00:20:23.100
"This is really the same
as (1+cos(2theta)) / 2.",00:20:23.100,00:20:29.180
"And now, this is easy.",00:20:29.180,00:20:32.700
It's got two parts to it.,00:20:32.700,00:20:34.340
"Integrating one half
gives me theta over-- Oh.",00:20:34.340,00:20:38.550
"Miraculously, the x
turned into a theta.",00:20:38.550,00:20:42.440
Let's put it back as x.,00:20:42.440,00:20:44.330
I get x/2 by integrating 1/2.,00:20:44.330,00:20:47.440
"So, notice that something
non-trigonometric occurs here",00:20:47.440,00:20:50.110
when I do these even integrals.,00:20:50.110,00:20:52.710
x/2 appears.,00:20:52.710,00:20:54.800
"And then the other one, OK, so
this takes a little thought.",00:20:54.800,00:20:57.880
"The integral of the
cosine is the sine,",00:20:57.880,00:21:01.870
or is it minus the sine.,00:21:01.870,00:21:05.520
Negative sine.,00:21:05.520,00:21:11.390
Shall we take a vote?,00:21:11.390,00:21:12.634
I think it's positive.,00:21:12.634,00:21:13.550
"And so you get sin(2x),
but is that right?",00:21:13.550,00:21:18.310
Over 2.,00:21:18.310,00:21:19.420
"If I differentiate the
sin(2x), this 2 comes out.",00:21:19.420,00:21:24.150
"And would give me
an extra 2 here.",00:21:24.150,00:21:25.950
"So there's an extra 2
that I have to put in here",00:21:25.950,00:21:29.580
when I integrate it.,00:21:29.580,00:21:34.670
And there's the answer.,00:21:34.670,00:21:37.230
This is not a substitution.,00:21:37.230,00:21:39.480
"I just played with
trig identities here.",00:21:39.480,00:21:41.550
"And then did a
simple trig integral,",00:21:41.550,00:21:45.020
"getting your help to
get the sign right.",00:21:45.020,00:21:46.900
"And thinking about what
this 2 is going to do.",00:21:46.900,00:21:49.310
"It produces a 2 in
the denominator.",00:21:49.310,00:21:52.990
"But it's not applying
any complicated thing.",00:21:52.990,00:21:59.270
It's just using this identity.,00:21:59.270,00:22:03.100
"Let's do another example
that's a little bit harder.",00:22:03.100,00:22:05.580
"This time, sin^2 times cos^2.",00:22:05.580,00:22:07.690
"Again, no odd powers.",00:22:35.940,00:22:37.920
"I've got to work a
little bit harder.",00:22:37.920,00:22:40.730
"And what I'm going to do
is apply those identities",00:22:40.730,00:22:42.930
up there.,00:22:42.930,00:22:44.210
"Now, what I recommend
doing in this situation",00:22:44.210,00:22:47.670
"is going over to
the side somewhere.",00:22:47.670,00:22:51.370
And do some side work.,00:22:51.370,00:22:55.610
"Because it's all just
playing with trig functions.",00:22:55.610,00:22:58.680
"It's not actually doing
any integrals for a while.",00:22:58.680,00:23:06.280
"So, I guess one way to get rid
of the sin^2 and the cos^2 is",00:23:06.280,00:23:11.815
"to use those identities
and so let's do that.",00:23:11.815,00:23:14.180
"So the sine is (1
- cos(2x)) / 2.",00:23:14.180,00:23:16.210
"And the cosine is
(1 + cos(2x)) / 2.",00:23:20.350,00:23:22.170
So I just substitute them in.,00:23:27.890,00:23:29.870
And now I can multiply that out.,00:23:29.870,00:23:31.560
"And what I have is a
difference times a sum.",00:23:31.560,00:23:38.030
So you know a formula for that.,00:23:38.030,00:23:40.771
"Taking the product of these two
things, well there'll be a 4",00:23:40.771,00:23:43.270
in the denominator.,00:23:43.270,00:23:44.430
"And then in the numerator,
I get the square",00:23:44.430,00:23:46.490
"of this minus the
square of this.",00:23:46.490,00:23:49.650
"(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 -
b^2. = - So I get that.",00:23:49.650,00:23:59.840
"Well, I'm a little bit
happier, because at least I",00:23:59.840,00:24:02.450
don't have 4.,00:24:02.450,00:24:03.710
"I don't have 2
different squares.",00:24:03.710,00:24:07.430
"I still have a square, and
want to integrate this.",00:24:07.430,00:24:09.940
I'm still not in the easy case.,00:24:09.940,00:24:12.170
"I got myself back to
an easier hard case.",00:24:12.170,00:24:16.970
"But we do know what
to do about this.",00:24:16.970,00:24:18.670
Because I just did it up there.,00:24:18.670,00:24:21.140
"And I could play into
this formula that we got.",00:24:21.140,00:24:24.430
"But I think it's just as easy
to continue to calculate here.",00:24:24.430,00:24:29.010
"Use the half angle
formula again for this,",00:24:29.010,00:24:32.880
and continue on your way.,00:24:32.880,00:24:34.900
So I get a 1/4 from this bit.,00:24:34.900,00:24:37.720
And then minus 1/4 of cos^2(2x).,00:24:37.720,00:24:43.260
"And when I plug in 2x in for
theta, there in the top board,",00:24:45.780,00:24:51.630
"I'm going to get a 4x
on the right-hand side.",00:24:51.630,00:24:59.650
So it comes out like that.,00:24:59.650,00:25:02.130
"And I guess I could simplify
that a little bit more.",00:25:02.130,00:25:04.600
This is a 1/4.,00:25:04.600,00:25:05.790
"Oh, but then there's a 2 here.",00:25:05.790,00:25:07.840
It's half that.,00:25:07.840,00:25:10.630
"So then I can simplify
a little more.",00:25:10.630,00:25:12.200
"It's 1/4 - 1/8, which is 1/8.",00:25:12.200,00:25:16.070
And then I have 1/8 cos(4x).,00:25:16.070,00:25:19.630
"OK, that's my side work.",00:25:25.510,00:25:27.560
"I just did some trig
identities over here.",00:25:27.560,00:25:30.590
"And rewrote sine
squared times cosine",00:25:30.590,00:25:32.840
"squared as something which
involves just no powers",00:25:32.840,00:25:35.930
"of trig, just cosine by itself.",00:25:35.930,00:25:37.940
And a constant.,00:25:37.940,00:25:41.330
"So I can take that and
substitute it in here.",00:25:41.330,00:25:45.090
"And now the integration
is pretty easy.",00:25:45.090,00:25:48.810
"1/8, cos(4x) / 8,
dx, which is, OK",00:25:48.810,00:25:57.810
the 1/8 is going to give me x/8.,00:25:57.810,00:26:01.340
"The integral or cosine is
plus or minus the sine.",00:26:01.340,00:26:06.314
"The derivative of the
sine is plus the cosine.",00:26:06.314,00:26:08.230
"So it's going to be plus the--
Only there's a minus here.",00:26:08.230,00:26:11.440
"So it's going to be the
sine-- minus sin(4x) / 8,",00:26:11.440,00:26:17.890
"but then I have an additional
factor in the denominator.",00:26:17.890,00:26:20.797
And what's it going to be?,00:26:20.797,00:26:21.880
I have to put a 4 there.,00:26:21.880,00:26:28.830
"So we've done that
calculation, too.",00:26:28.830,00:26:32.730
"So any of these-- If you keep
doing this kind of process,",00:26:32.730,00:26:38.250
"these two kinds
of procedures, you",00:26:38.250,00:26:45.530
"can now integrate
any expression that",00:26:45.530,00:26:48.840
"has a power of a sine times
a power of a cosine in it,",00:26:48.840,00:26:52.040
by using these ideas.,00:26:52.040,00:26:56.860
"Now, let's see.",00:26:56.860,00:27:01.730
"Oh, let me give you an alternate
method for this last one here.",00:27:01.730,00:27:16.210
I know what I'll do.,00:27:16.210,00:27:26.460
"Let me give an alternate
method for doing, really",00:27:26.460,00:27:28.850
doing the side work over there.,00:27:28.850,00:27:31.670
"I'm trying to deal
with sin^2 times cos^2.",00:27:31.670,00:27:35.920
"Well that's the
square of sin x cos x.",00:27:35.920,00:27:50.080
"And sin x cos x
shows up right here.",00:27:50.080,00:27:54.240
In another trig identity.,00:27:54.240,00:27:55.900
"So we can make use of that, too.",00:27:55.900,00:27:58.410
"That reduces the number of
factors of sines and cosines",00:27:58.410,00:28:01.330
by 1.,00:28:01.330,00:28:01.930
"So it's going in
the right direction.",00:28:01.930,00:28:04.190
"This is equal to 1/2
sin(2x), squared.",00:28:04.190,00:28:11.270
"Sine times cosine is
1/2-- Say this right.",00:28:11.270,00:28:17.730
"It's sin(2x) / 2, and then
I want to square that.",00:28:17.730,00:28:21.280
So what I get is sin^2(2x) / 4.,00:28:21.280,00:28:31.030
"Which is, well, I'm
not too happy yet,",00:28:31.030,00:28:33.930
"because I still
have an even power.",00:28:33.930,00:28:35.639
"Remember I'm trying to
integrate this thing in the end,",00:28:35.639,00:28:37.930
even powers are bad.,00:28:37.930,00:28:39.060
I try to get rid of them.,00:28:39.060,00:28:40.910
"By using that formula,
the half angle formula.",00:28:40.910,00:28:46.360
"So I can apply that
to sin x here again.",00:28:46.360,00:28:48.950
I get 1/4 of (1 - cos(4x)) / 2.,00:28:48.950,00:28:52.600
"That's what the half angle
formula says for sin^2(2x).",00:28:57.480,00:28:59.730
"And that's exactly the
same as the expression",00:29:02.330,00:29:04.790
"that I got up here, as well.",00:29:04.790,00:29:08.660
"It's the same expression
that I have there.",00:29:08.660,00:29:11.710
"So it's the same
expression as I have here.",00:29:11.710,00:29:16.680
"So this is just an alternate
way to play this game of using",00:29:16.680,00:29:20.000
the half angle formula.,00:29:20.000,00:29:24.940
"OK, let's do a little
application of these things",00:29:24.940,00:29:27.790
"and change the
topic a little bit.",00:29:27.790,00:29:46.060
So here's the problem.,00:29:46.060,00:29:48.210
"So this is an
application and example",00:29:48.210,00:29:56.900
of a real trig substitution.,00:29:56.900,00:30:07.570
"So here's the problem
I want to look at.",00:30:07.570,00:30:22.080
"OK, so I have a circle
whose radius is a.",00:30:22.080,00:30:26.210
"And I cut out from it
a sort of tab, here.",00:30:26.210,00:30:31.710
This tab here.,00:30:31.710,00:30:36.330
"And the height of
this thing is b.",00:30:36.330,00:30:38.590
So this length is a number b.,00:30:38.590,00:30:42.110
"And what I want to do is compute
the area of that little tab.",00:30:42.110,00:30:47.219
That's the problem.,00:30:47.219,00:30:48.010
So there's an arc over here.,00:30:48.010,00:30:50.360
"And I want to find the
area of this, for a and b,",00:30:50.360,00:30:55.060
in terms of a and b.,00:30:55.060,00:30:57.980
"So the area, well,
I guess one way",00:30:57.980,00:31:06.730
"to compute the area would be
to take the integral of y dx.",00:31:06.730,00:31:12.370
"You've seen the idea
of splitting this up",00:31:12.370,00:31:15.980
"into vertical strips whose
height is given by a function",00:31:15.980,00:31:20.600
y(x).,00:31:20.600,00:31:21.100
And then you integrate that.,00:31:21.100,00:31:22.266
"That's an interpretation
for the integral.",00:31:22.266,00:31:24.040
The area is given by y dx.,00:31:24.040,00:31:27.210
"But that's a little bit awkward,
because my formula for y",00:31:27.210,00:31:30.327
is going to be a little strange.,00:31:30.327,00:31:31.660
"It's constant, value of b, along
here, and then at this point",00:31:31.660,00:31:34.630
"it becomes this
arc, of the circle.",00:31:34.630,00:31:37.660
"So working this
out, I could do it",00:31:37.660,00:31:39.500
"but it's a little awkward
because expressing y",00:31:39.500,00:31:42.100
"as a function of x, the
top edge of this shape,",00:31:42.100,00:31:45.880
"it's a little awkward, and
takes two different regions",00:31:45.880,00:31:50.090
to express.,00:31:50.090,00:31:51.740
"So, a different way to
say it is to say x dy.",00:31:51.740,00:31:58.620
"Maybe that'll work
a little bit better.",00:31:58.620,00:32:00.350
"Or maybe it won't,
but it's worth trying.",00:32:00.350,00:32:02.810
"I could just as well
split this region up",00:32:02.810,00:32:05.290
into horizontal strips.,00:32:05.290,00:32:08.420
"Whose width is dy,
and whose length is x.",00:32:08.420,00:32:13.010
"Now I'm thinking of
this as a function of y.",00:32:13.010,00:32:17.250
"This is the graph
of a function of y.",00:32:17.250,00:32:20.870
"And that's much better, because
the function of y is, well,",00:32:20.870,00:32:24.880
"it's the square root
of a^2 - y^2, isn't it.",00:32:24.880,00:32:28.010
That's x x^2 + y^2 = a^2.,00:32:28.010,00:32:34.300
So that's what x is.,00:32:34.300,00:32:38.640
"And that's what I'm
asked to integrate, then.",00:32:38.640,00:32:41.740
"Square root of (a^2 - y^2), dy.",00:32:41.740,00:32:45.580
"And I can even put in
limits of integration.",00:32:45.580,00:32:47.500
"Maybe I should do that,
because this is supposed",00:32:47.500,00:32:49.500
to be an actual number.,00:32:49.500,00:32:50.910
"I guess I'm integrating it
from y = 0, that's here.",00:32:50.910,00:32:55.130
"To y = b, dy.",00:32:55.130,00:33:00.059
So this is what I want to find.,00:33:00.059,00:33:01.350
"This is a integral formula
for the area of that region.",00:33:01.350,00:33:07.420
And this is a new form.,00:33:07.420,00:33:08.730
"I don't think that
you've thought",00:33:08.730,00:33:13.970
"about integrating expressions
like this in this class before.",00:33:13.970,00:33:20.310
"So, it's a new form and I
want to show you how to do it,",00:33:20.310,00:33:23.660
"how it's related
to trigonometry.",00:33:23.660,00:33:30.290
"It's related to trigonometry
through that exact picture",00:33:30.290,00:33:33.080
that we have on the blackboard.,00:33:33.080,00:33:36.710
"After all, this a^2 - y^2
is the formula for this arc.",00:33:36.710,00:33:42.610
"And so, what I
propose is that we",00:33:42.610,00:33:45.460
"try to exploit the
connection with the circle",00:33:45.460,00:33:49.700
and introduce polar coordinates.,00:33:49.700,00:33:52.860
"So, here if I measure
this angle then there",00:33:52.860,00:34:03.499
are various things you can say.,00:34:03.499,00:34:04.790
"Like the coordinates of this
point here are a cos(theta),",00:34:04.790,00:34:08.076
"a-- Well, I'm sorry, it's not.",00:34:08.076,00:34:17.670
"That's an angle, but I
want to call it theta_0.",00:34:17.670,00:34:20.780
"And, in general you know
that the coordinates of this",00:34:20.780,00:34:25.300
"point are (a cos(theta),
a sin(theta)).",00:34:25.300,00:34:31.010
"If the radius is a, then
the angle here is theta.",00:34:31.010,00:34:39.370
"So x = a cos(theta),
and y = a sin(theta),",00:34:39.370,00:34:45.170
"just from looking at the
geometry of the circle.",00:34:45.170,00:34:49.100
"So let's make that
substitution. y = a sin(theta).",00:34:49.100,00:34:52.530
"I'm using the picture to
suggest that maybe making",00:34:56.600,00:35:00.740
"the substitution is
a good thing to do.",00:35:00.740,00:35:02.870
"Let's follow along
and see what happens.",00:35:02.870,00:35:06.020
"If that's true, what we're
interested in is integrating,",00:35:06.020,00:35:10.310
a^2 - y^2.,00:35:10.310,00:35:13.580
"Which is a^2-- We're interested
in integrating the square root",00:35:13.580,00:35:18.900
of a^2 - y^2.,00:35:18.900,00:35:20.770
"Which is the square
root of a^2 minus this.",00:35:20.770,00:35:24.130
a^2 sin^2(theta).,00:35:24.130,00:35:27.100
"And, well, that's
equal to a cos theta.",00:35:27.100,00:35:35.870
"That's just sin^2 + cos^2
= 1, all over again.",00:35:35.870,00:35:41.710
It's also x.,00:35:41.710,00:35:42.830
This is x.,00:35:42.830,00:35:44.560
And this was x.,00:35:44.560,00:35:46.070
"So there are a lot of different
ways to think of this.",00:35:46.070,00:35:48.960
"But no matter how you say
it, the thing we're trying",00:35:48.960,00:35:51.650
"to integrate, a^2 - y^2 is,
under this substitution it is",00:35:51.650,00:35:59.270
a cos(theta).,00:35:59.270,00:36:02.570
"So I'm interested in integrating
the square root of (a^2 - y^2),",00:36:02.570,00:36:06.700
dy.,00:36:06.700,00:36:09.260
"And I'm going to make this
substitution y = a sin(theta).",00:36:09.260,00:36:14.330
"And so under that substitution,
I've decided that the square",00:36:17.330,00:36:22.320
"root of a^2 - y^2
is a cos(theta).",00:36:22.320,00:36:26.170
That's this.,00:36:31.170,00:36:33.240
What about the dy?,00:36:33.240,00:36:34.690
"Well, I'd better compute the dy.",00:36:34.690,00:36:38.310
"So dy, just differentiating
this expression,",00:36:38.310,00:36:40.920
is a cos(theta) d theta.,00:36:40.920,00:36:44.820
"So let's put that in. dy
= a cos(theta) d theta.",00:36:44.820,00:36:57.240
OK.,00:36:57.240,00:36:58.310
"Making that trig substitution,
y = a sin(theta),",00:36:58.310,00:37:03.720
"has replaced this integral
that has a square root in it.",00:37:03.720,00:37:06.750
And no trig functions.,00:37:06.750,00:37:08.640
"With an integral that involves
no square roots and only trig",00:37:08.640,00:37:12.630
functions.,00:37:12.630,00:37:15.140
"In fact, it's not too hard to
integrate this now, because",00:37:15.140,00:37:17.630
of the work that we've done.,00:37:17.630,00:37:19.270
The a^2 comes out.,00:37:19.270,00:37:20.980
This is cos^2(theta) d theta.,00:37:20.980,00:37:22.630
"And maybe we've done that
example already today.",00:37:26.200,00:37:28.580
I think we have.,00:37:28.580,00:37:35.920
"Maybe we can think it through,
but maybe the easiest thing",00:37:35.920,00:37:38.435
"is to look back at notes
and see what we got before.",00:37:38.435,00:37:42.550
"That was the first example
in the hard case that I did.",00:37:42.550,00:37:46.330
"And what it came out to, I used
x instead of theta at the time.",00:37:46.330,00:38:03.060
So this is a good step forward.,00:38:03.060,00:38:05.570
"I started with this
integral that I really",00:38:05.570,00:38:08.130
"didn't know how to do by any
means that we've had so far.",00:38:08.130,00:38:12.440
"And I've replaced it
by a trig integral",00:38:12.440,00:38:15.000
that we do know how to do.,00:38:15.000,00:38:16.250
"And now I've done
that trig integral.",00:38:16.250,00:38:19.160
"But we're still not quite
done, because of the problem",00:38:19.160,00:38:22.400
of back substituting.,00:38:22.400,00:38:23.830
"I'd like to go back and
rewrite this in terms",00:38:23.830,00:38:27.670
"of the original variable, y.",00:38:27.670,00:38:32.150
"Or, I'd like to go
back and rewrite it",00:38:32.150,00:38:34.280
"in terms of the original
limits of integration",00:38:34.280,00:38:36.390
"that we had in the
original problem.",00:38:36.390,00:38:40.050
"In doing that, it's going
to be useful to rewrite",00:38:40.050,00:38:42.870
"this expression and get
rid of the sin(2theta).",00:38:42.870,00:38:47.150
"After all, the original
y was expressed in terms",00:38:47.150,00:38:51.840
"of sin(theta), not sin(2theta).",00:38:51.840,00:38:54.660
"So let me just do that here,
and say that this, in turn,",00:38:54.660,00:39:04.220
"is equal to a^2
theta / 2 plus, well,",00:39:04.220,00:39:09.507
"sin(2theta) = 2
sin(theta) cos(theta).",00:39:09.507,00:39:11.090
"And so, when there's a 4 in
the denominator, what I'll get",00:39:18.080,00:39:20.970
is sin(theta) cos(theta) / 2.,00:39:20.970,00:39:25.390
"I did that because I'm getting
closer to the original terms",00:39:32.580,00:39:36.630
that the problem started with.,00:39:36.630,00:39:39.080
Which was sin(theta).,00:39:39.080,00:39:40.130
"So let me write down the
integral that we have now.",00:40:05.480,00:40:08.055
"The square root of a^2
- y^2, dy is, so far,",00:40:08.055,00:40:14.680
"what we know is a^2 (theta / 2 +
sin(theta) cos(theta) / 2) + c.",00:40:14.680,00:40:26.810
"But I want to go
back and rewrite this",00:40:26.810,00:40:28.460
in terms of the original value.,00:40:28.460,00:40:30.660
"The original variable, y.",00:40:30.660,00:40:32.650
"Well, what is theta
in terms of y?",00:40:32.650,00:40:37.430
"Let's see. y in terms of
theta was given like this.",00:40:37.430,00:40:40.760
So what is theta in terms of y?,00:40:40.760,00:40:44.120
Ah.,00:40:44.120,00:40:44.950
"So here the fearsome arcsine
rears its head, right?",00:40:44.950,00:40:48.710
"Theta is the angle so
that y = a sin(theta).",00:40:48.710,00:40:53.680
"So that means that theta is
the arcsine, or sine inverse,",00:40:53.680,00:40:58.230
of y/a.,00:40:58.230,00:41:00.750
"So that's the first
thing that shows up here.",00:41:07.450,00:41:12.630
"arcsin(y/a), all over 2.",00:41:12.630,00:41:18.290
That's this term.,00:41:18.290,00:41:19.360
Theta is arcsin(y/a) / 2.,00:41:19.360,00:41:24.530
"What about the other side, here?",00:41:24.530,00:41:26.630
"Well sine and cosine, we knew
what they were in terms of y",00:41:26.630,00:41:30.620
"and in terms of x, if you like.",00:41:30.620,00:41:37.830
"Maybe I'll put the
a^2 inside here.",00:41:37.830,00:41:40.300
"That makes it a
little bit nicer.",00:41:40.300,00:41:42.710
"Plus, and the other term is
a^2 sin(theta) cos(theta).",00:41:42.710,00:41:49.310
So the a sin(theta) is just y.,00:41:49.310,00:41:52.610
"Maybe I'll write this (a
sin(theta)) (a cos(theta))",00:41:52.610,00:41:55.140
/ 2 + c.,00:41:55.140,00:41:57.550
And so I get the same thing.,00:42:02.330,00:42:03.840
"And now here a
sin(theta), that's y.",00:42:03.840,00:42:06.204
And what's the a cos(theta)?,00:42:06.204,00:42:07.370
"It's x, or, if you like, it's
the square root of a^2 - y^2.",00:42:12.490,00:42:16.440
"And so there I've
rewritten everything, back",00:42:22.010,00:42:28.140
"in terms of the
original variable, y.",00:42:28.140,00:42:31.250
And there's an answer.,00:42:31.250,00:42:36.060
"So I've done this indefinite
integration of a form--",00:42:36.060,00:42:41.070
"of this quadratic, this square
root of something which is",00:42:41.070,00:42:44.810
a constant minus y^2.,00:42:44.810,00:42:46.940
"Whenever you see that, the thing
to think of is trigonometry.",00:42:46.940,00:42:50.640
"That's going to play into
the sin^2 + cos^2 identity.",00:42:50.640,00:42:54.310
"And the way to exploit it
is to make the substitution",00:42:54.310,00:42:56.880
y = a sin(theta).,00:42:56.880,00:43:01.100
"You could also make a
substitution y = a cos(theta),",00:43:01.100,00:43:04.340
if you wanted to.,00:43:04.340,00:43:05.540
"And the result would come out
to exactly the same in the end.",00:43:05.540,00:43:12.290
"I'm still not quite done
with the original problem",00:43:12.290,00:43:14.430
"that I had, because
the original problem",00:43:14.430,00:43:23.990
asked for a definite integral.,00:43:23.990,00:43:25.810
"So let's just go back
and finish that as well.",00:43:25.810,00:43:33.000
"So the area was
the integral from 0",00:43:33.000,00:43:37.910
to b of this square root.,00:43:37.910,00:43:45.740
"So I just want to evaluate
the right-hand side here.",00:43:45.740,00:43:48.220
"The answer that we came up
with, this indefinite integral.",00:43:48.220,00:43:50.880
"I want to evaluate
it at 0 and at b.",00:43:50.880,00:43:53.374
"Well, let's see.",00:43:53.374,00:43:54.040
"When I evaluate it at b, I get
a^2 arcsin(b/a) / 2 plus y,",00:43:54.040,00:44:13.470
"which is b, times the
square root of a^2 - b^2,",00:44:13.470,00:44:18.900
"putting y = b, divided by 2.",00:44:18.900,00:44:23.050
"So I've plugged in y
= b into that formula,",00:44:23.050,00:44:26.300
this is what I get.,00:44:26.300,00:44:27.290
"Then when I plug in y = 0,
well the, sine of 0 is 0,",00:44:27.290,00:44:31.280
so the arcsine of 0 is 0.,00:44:31.280,00:44:34.040
So this term goes away.,00:44:34.040,00:44:35.720
"And when y = 0,
this term is 0 also.",00:44:35.720,00:44:38.930
"And so I don't get any
subtracted terms at all.",00:44:38.930,00:44:43.210
"So there's an
expression for this.",00:44:43.210,00:44:45.600
"Notice that this arcsin(b/a),
that's exactly this angle.",00:44:45.600,00:44:52.360
"arcsin(b/a), it's the angle
that you get when y = b.",00:44:52.360,00:45:00.550
"So this theta is
the arcsin(b/a).",00:45:00.550,00:45:06.760
Put this over here.,00:45:09.990,00:45:15.870
That is theta_0.,00:45:15.870,00:45:17.090
"That is the angle
that the corner makes.",00:45:17.090,00:45:21.560
"So I could rewrite this as a
a^2 theta_0 / 2 plus b times",00:45:21.560,00:45:28.460
"the square root of
a^2 - b^2, over 2.",00:45:28.460,00:45:34.722
"Let's just think about
this for a minute.",00:45:34.722,00:45:36.430
"I have these two terms in
the sum, is that reasonable?",00:45:36.430,00:45:40.320
The first term is a^2.,00:45:40.320,00:45:44.080
"That's the radius squared
times this angle, times 1/2.",00:45:44.080,00:45:50.370
"Well, I think that is exactly
the area of this sector.",00:45:50.370,00:45:54.280
"a^2 theta / 2 is the formula
for the area of the sector.",00:45:54.280,00:46:03.170
"And this one, this is
the vertical elevation.",00:46:03.170,00:46:07.070
This is the horizontal.,00:46:07.070,00:46:09.500
a^2 - b^2 is this distance.,00:46:09.500,00:46:14.550
Square root of a^2 - b^2.,00:46:14.550,00:46:16.980
"So the right-hand term is b
times the square root of a^2 -",00:46:16.980,00:46:20.420
"b^2 divided by 2, that's
the area of that triangle.",00:46:20.420,00:46:31.930
"So using a little
bit of geometry",00:46:31.930,00:46:34.280
"gives you the same answer as
all of this elaborate calculus.",00:46:34.280,00:46:39.890
"Maybe that's enough
cause for celebration",00:46:39.890,00:46:41.610
for us to quit for today.,00:46:41.610,00:46:43.620
