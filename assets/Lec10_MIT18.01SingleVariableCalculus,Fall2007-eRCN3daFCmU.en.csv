"JERISON: So, we're ready to
begin Lecture 10, and what I'm",00:00:22.240,00:00:25.940
"going to begin with is
by finishing up some",00:00:25.940,00:00:29.060
things from last time.,00:00:29.060,00:00:33.880
"We'll talk about approximations,
and I want to",00:00:33.880,00:00:42.810
"fill in a number of comments and
get you a little bit more",00:00:42.810,00:00:50.420
"oriented in the point of view
that I'm trying to express",00:00:50.420,00:00:54.350
about approximations.,00:00:54.350,00:00:55.980
"So, first of all, I want to
remind you of the actual",00:00:55.980,00:00:59.740
"applied example that I
wrote down last time.",00:00:59.740,00:01:03.800
"So that was this
business here.",00:01:03.800,00:01:08.730
"There was something from
special relativity.",00:01:08.730,00:01:11.590
"And the approximation that
we used was the linear",00:01:11.590,00:01:15.990
"approximation, with a - 1/2
power that comes out to be t(",00:01:15.990,00:01:20.360
1 1/2 v^2 / C^2).,00:01:20.360,00:01:23.730
"I want to reiterate why
this is a useful way",00:01:27.340,00:01:30.290
of thinking of things.,00:01:30.290,00:01:31.930
"And why this is that this
comes up in real life.",00:01:31.930,00:01:34.830
"Why this is maybe more important
than everything that",00:01:34.830,00:01:37.200
"I've taught you about
technically so far.",00:01:37.200,00:01:39.820
"So, first of all, what this is
telling us is the change in t",00:01:39.820,00:01:46.750
"/ t, if you do the arithmetic
here and subtract t that's",00:01:46.750,00:01:51.440
"using the change in
t is t' - t here.",00:01:51.440,00:01:55.970
"If you work that out, this is
approximately the same as 1/2",00:01:55.970,00:02:01.440
(v^2 / C^2).,00:02:01.440,00:02:04.140
So what is this saying?,00:02:04.140,00:02:06.270
"This is saying that if you have
this satellite, which is",00:02:06.270,00:02:08.670
"going at speed v, and little c
is the speed of light, then",00:02:08.670,00:02:13.280
"the change in the watch down
here on earth, relative to the",00:02:13.280,00:02:18.220
"time on the satellite, is going
to be proportional to",00:02:18.220,00:02:22.270
this ratio here.,00:02:22.270,00:02:24.050
"So, physically, this
makes sense.",00:02:24.050,00:02:25.710
This is time divided by time.,00:02:25.710,00:02:28.120
"And this is velocity squared
divided by velocity squared.",00:02:28.120,00:02:30.670
"So, in each case, the
units divide out.",00:02:30.670,00:02:32.620
"So this is a dimensionless
quantity.",00:02:32.620,00:02:34.880
"And this is a dimensionless
quantity.",00:02:34.880,00:02:36.960
"And the only point here that
we're trying to make is just",00:02:36.960,00:02:41.560
this notion of proportionality.,00:02:41.560,00:02:43.440
So I want to write this down.,00:02:43.440,00:02:45.470
"Just, in summary.",00:02:45.470,00:02:48.010
"So the error fraction, if you
like, which is sort of the",00:02:48.010,00:02:51.100
"number of significant digits
that we have in our",00:02:51.100,00:02:55.030
"measurement, is proportional,
in this",00:02:55.030,00:03:00.390
"case, to this quantity.",00:03:00.390,00:03:04.860
"It happens to be proportional
to this quantity here.",00:03:04.860,00:03:09.030
"And the factor is, happens
to be, 1/2.",00:03:09.030,00:03:16.980
"So these proportionality
factors are what",00:03:16.980,00:03:20.450
we're looking for.,00:03:20.450,00:03:21.350
Their rates of change.,00:03:21.350,00:03:22.590
"Their rates of change of
something with respect to",00:03:22.590,00:03:24.380
something else.,00:03:24.380,00:03:25.550
"Now, on your homework,
you have something",00:03:25.550,00:03:28.800
rather similar to this.,00:03:28.800,00:03:30.740
"So in Problem, on Part 2b, Part
II, Problem 1, there's",00:03:30.740,00:03:38.880
"the speed of a pitch, right?",00:03:38.880,00:03:41.580
"And the speed of the pitch is
changing depending on how high",00:03:41.580,00:03:44.640
the mound is.,00:03:44.640,00:03:45.600
"And the point here is that
that's approximately",00:03:45.600,00:03:48.390
"proportional to the change in
the height of the mound.",00:03:48.390,00:03:52.320
"In that problem, we had this
delta h, that was the x",00:03:52.320,00:03:55.390
variable in that problem.,00:03:55.390,00:03:56.890
"And what you're trying to
figure out is what the",00:03:56.890,00:03:58.780
"constant of proportionality
is.",00:03:58.780,00:04:03.350
"That's what you're aiming
for in this problem.",00:04:03.350,00:04:04.820
"So there's a linear
relationship, approximately,",00:04:04.820,00:04:08.070
"to all intents and purposes
this is an equality.",00:04:08.070,00:04:11.890
"Because the lower
order terms are",00:04:11.890,00:04:13.290
unimportant for the problem.,00:04:13.290,00:04:14.720
"Just as over here, this function
is a little bit",00:04:14.720,00:04:17.120
complicated.,00:04:17.120,00:04:18.020
"This function is a little
more simple.",00:04:18.020,00:04:19.800
"For the purposes of this
problem, they are the same.",00:04:19.800,00:04:22.800
"Because the errors are
negligible for the particular",00:04:22.800,00:04:28.240
problem that we're working on.,00:04:28.240,00:04:29.760
"So we might as well work with
the simpler relationship.",00:04:29.760,00:04:34.210
"And similarly, over here, so
you could do this with, in",00:04:34.210,00:04:37.920
"this case with square roots,
it's not so hard here with",00:04:37.920,00:04:40.280
reciprocals of square roots.,00:04:40.280,00:04:41.980
"It's also not terribly hard
to do it numerically.",00:04:41.980,00:04:45.300
"And the reason why we're not
doing it numerically is that,",00:04:45.300,00:04:49.030
"as I say, this is something
that happens all across",00:04:49.030,00:04:52.570
engineering.,00:04:52.570,00:04:53.560
"People are looking for these
linear relationships between",00:04:53.560,00:04:56.040
"the change in some input and
the change in the output.",00:04:56.040,00:05:00.240
"And if you don't make these
simplifications, then when you",00:05:00.240,00:05:03.910
"get, say, a dozen of them
together, you can't figure out",00:05:03.910,00:05:07.680
what's going on.,00:05:07.680,00:05:09.540
In this case the design of the,00:05:09.540,00:05:11.090
"satellite, it's very important.",00:05:11.090,00:05:12.640
"The speed actually isn't
just one speed.",00:05:12.640,00:05:15.160
"Because it's the relative speed
of u to the satellite.",00:05:15.160,00:05:19.070
"And you might be, it depends
on your angle of sight with",00:05:19.070,00:05:21.750
"the satellite what
the speed is.",00:05:21.750,00:05:22.890
So it varies quite a bit.,00:05:22.890,00:05:24.300
"So you really need this
rule of thumb.",00:05:24.300,00:05:26.280
"Then there are all
kinds of other",00:05:26.280,00:05:27.640
considerations in this question.,00:05:27.640,00:05:29.080
"Like, for example, there's the
fact that we're sitting on",00:05:29.080,00:05:31.530
"Earth and so we're rotating
around on what's called a",00:05:31.530,00:05:34.250
non-inertial frame.,00:05:34.250,00:05:36.250
"So there's the question
of that acceleration.",00:05:36.250,00:05:38.790
"There's the question that the
gravity that I experience here",00:05:38.790,00:05:41.220
"on Earth is not the same
as up at the satellite.",00:05:41.220,00:05:44.830
"And that also creates a
difference in time, as a",00:05:44.830,00:05:48.070
result of general relativity.,00:05:48.070,00:05:49.580
"So all of these considerations
come down to formulas which",00:05:49.580,00:05:54.470
"are this complicated or
maybe a tiny bit more.",00:05:54.470,00:05:56.910
Not really that much.,00:05:56.910,00:05:58.330
"And then people simplify them
enormously to these very",00:05:58.330,00:06:00.700
simple-minded rules.,00:06:00.700,00:06:02.090
"And they don't keep track
of what's going on.",00:06:02.090,00:06:05.130
"So in order to design the
system, you must make these",00:06:05.130,00:06:08.070
"simplifications, otherwise you
can't even think about",00:06:08.070,00:06:10.440
what's going on.,00:06:10.440,00:06:12.630
This comes up in everything.,00:06:12.630,00:06:13.860
"In weather forecasting,
economic forecasting.",00:06:13.860,00:06:17.680
"Figuring out whether there's
going to be an asteroid that's",00:06:17.680,00:06:19.880
going to hit the Earth.,00:06:19.880,00:06:22.140
"Every single one of these things
involves dozens of",00:06:22.140,00:06:24.580
these considerations.,00:06:24.580,00:06:27.900
"OK, there was a question
that I saw, here.",00:06:27.900,00:06:30.050
Yes.,00:06:30.050,00:06:30.450
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:06:30.450,00:06:38.920
PROF.,00:06:38.920,00:06:39.320
JERISON: Yeah.,00:06:39.320,00:06:40.120
"Basically, any problem where
you have a derivative, the",00:06:40.120,00:06:42.600
"rate of change also depends upon
what the base point is.",00:06:42.600,00:06:46.100
That's the question.,00:06:46.100,00:06:46.850
"You're saying, doesn't this
delta v also depend, I had a",00:06:46.850,00:06:50.060
base point in that problem.,00:06:50.060,00:06:51.050
"I happened to decide that
pitchers pitch on average",00:06:51.050,00:06:53.290
about 90 miles an hour.,00:06:53.290,00:06:55.350
"Whereas, in fact, some pitchers
pitch at 100 miles an",00:06:55.350,00:06:58.390
"hour, some pitch at 80 miles
an hour, and of course they",00:06:58.390,00:07:00.410
vary the speed of the pitch.,00:07:00.410,00:07:02.040
"And so, this varies
a little bit.",00:07:02.040,00:07:03.510
"In fact, that's sort of
a second order effect.",00:07:03.510,00:07:05.165
"It does change the constant
of proportionality.",00:07:05.165,00:07:08.220
"It's a rate of change at
a different base point.",00:07:08.220,00:07:11.790
Which we're considering fixed.,00:07:11.790,00:07:14.230
"In fact, that's sort of
a second order effect.",00:07:14.230,00:07:17.060
"When you actually do the
computations, what you",00:07:17.060,00:07:19.250
"discover is that it doesn't
make that much difference.",00:07:19.250,00:07:21.940
To the a.,00:07:21.940,00:07:22.630
"And that's something that
you get from experience.",00:07:22.630,00:07:25.040
"That it turns out, which
things matter and",00:07:25.040,00:07:28.270
which things don't.,00:07:28.270,00:07:28.980
"And yet again, that's exactly
the same sort of consideration",00:07:28.980,00:07:31.820
"but at the next order of what
I'm talking about here is.",00:07:31.820,00:07:34.670
"You have to have enough
experience with numbers to",00:07:34.670,00:07:36.540
"know that if you take, if you
vary something a little bit",00:07:36.540,00:07:39.210
"it's not going to change
the answer that you're",00:07:39.210,00:07:40.950
looking for very much.,00:07:40.950,00:07:42.680
"And that's exactly the point
that I'm making.",00:07:42.680,00:07:45.530
"So I can't make them all at
once, all such points.",00:07:45.530,00:07:51.830
"So that's my pitch for
understanding things from this",00:07:51.830,00:07:55.590
point of view.,00:07:55.590,00:07:56.470
"Now, we're going to go
on, now, to quadratic",00:07:56.470,00:08:00.090
"approximations, which are a
little more complicated.",00:08:00.090,00:08:13.290
"So, we talked a little bit about
this last time but I",00:08:13.290,00:08:16.110
didn't finish.,00:08:16.110,00:08:16.850
So I want to finish this up.,00:08:16.850,00:08:19.930
"And the first thing that I
should say is that you use the",00:08:19.930,00:08:26.920
"when the linear approximation
is not enough.",00:08:26.920,00:08:35.680
"OK, so, that's something that
you really need to get a",00:08:35.680,00:08:38.660
little experience with.,00:08:38.660,00:08:40.390
"In economics, I told you they
use logarithms. So sometimes",00:08:40.390,00:08:44.480
they use log linear functions.,00:08:44.480,00:08:46.030
"Sometimes they use log quadratic
functions when the",00:08:46.030,00:08:48.190
log linear ones don't work.,00:08:48.190,00:08:49.860
"So most modeling in
economics is with",00:08:49.860,00:08:51.840
log quadratic functions.,00:08:51.840,00:08:53.730
"And if you've made it
any more complicated",00:08:53.730,00:08:55.250
"than that, it's useless.",00:08:55.250,00:08:56.740
And it's a mess.,00:08:56.740,00:08:57.850
And people don't do it.,00:08:57.850,00:08:58.810
"So they stick with the quadratic
ones, typically.",00:08:58.810,00:09:02.790
"So the basic formula here, and
I'm going to take the base",00:09:02.790,00:09:07.010
"point to be 0, is that f (
x ) is approximately f",00:09:07.010,00:09:10.745
( 0 ) f' ( 0 )x.,00:09:10.745,00:09:14.380
That's the linear part.,00:09:14.380,00:09:16.100
Plus this extra term.,00:09:16.100,00:09:17.520
Which is f'' ( 0 ) / 2x^2.,00:09:17.520,00:09:21.440
"And this is supposed to
work for x near 0.",00:09:21.440,00:09:27.740
"So it shows in the base point
as simply as possible.",00:09:27.740,00:09:34.310
"So here's more or less where
we left off last time.",00:09:34.310,00:09:38.060
"And one thing that I said I was
going to explain, which I",00:09:38.060,00:09:41.950
"will now, is why it's
(1/2) f'' ( 0 ).",00:09:41.950,00:09:48.390
So we need to know that.,00:09:48.390,00:09:51.610
"So let's work that out
here first of all.",00:09:51.610,00:09:54.770
"So I'm just going to
do it by example.",00:09:54.770,00:09:57.290
"So if you like, the answer is
just, well, what happens when",00:09:57.290,00:10:00.720
you have a parabola?,00:10:00.720,00:10:03.600
A parabola's a quadratic.,00:10:03.600,00:10:06.640
"It had better, its quadratic
approximation",00:10:06.640,00:10:08.750
had better be itself.,00:10:08.750,00:10:10.450
It's got to be the best one.,00:10:10.450,00:10:11.480
So it's got to be itself.,00:10:11.480,00:10:13.010
"So this formula, if it's
going to work, has",00:10:13.010,00:10:15.500
to work on the nose.,00:10:15.500,00:10:19.550
For quadratic functions.,00:10:19.550,00:10:21.890
"So, let's take a look.",00:10:21.890,00:10:23.770
"If I differentiate,
I get b 2cx.",00:10:23.770,00:10:28.130
"If I differentiate a second
time, I get 2c.",00:10:28.130,00:10:32.230
And now let's plug it in.,00:10:32.230,00:10:34.580
"Well, we can recover, what is
it that we want to recover?",00:10:34.580,00:10:39.450
"We want to recover these numbers
a, b and c using the",00:10:39.450,00:10:42.650
derivatives evaluated at 0.,00:10:42.650,00:10:45.930
So let's see.,00:10:45.930,00:10:49.500
"It's pretty easy, actually.
f ( 0 ) = a.",00:10:49.500,00:10:52.680
That's on the nose.,00:10:52.680,00:10:53.360
"If you plug in x = 0 here,
these terms drop",00:10:53.360,00:10:56.320
out and you get a.,00:10:56.320,00:10:58.070
"And now, f' ( 0 ), whoops
that was wrong.",00:10:58.070,00:11:02.220
"So I wrote f' but what
I meant was f.",00:11:02.220,00:11:05.100
So f ( 0 ) is a.,00:11:05.100,00:11:07.950
"Let's back up. f ( 0 ) is a, so
if I plug in x = 0 I get a.",00:11:07.950,00:11:13.130
"Now, f' ( 0 ), that's this next
formula here, f' ( 0 ), I",00:11:13.130,00:11:18.870
"plug in 0 here, and I get b.",00:11:18.870,00:11:21.180
That's also good.,00:11:21.180,00:11:22.230
"And that's exactly what the
linear approximation is",00:11:22.230,00:11:24.620
supposed to be.,00:11:24.620,00:11:25.540
"But now you notice, f'' is 2c.",00:11:25.540,00:11:28.480
"So to recover c, I better
take half of it.",00:11:28.480,00:11:34.440
And that's it.,00:11:34.440,00:11:35.120
That's the reason.,00:11:35.120,00:11:38.010
"There's no chance that any
other formula could work.",00:11:38.010,00:11:40.690
And this one does.,00:11:40.690,00:11:45.050
"So that's the explanation
for the formula.",00:11:45.050,00:11:50.310
"And now I remind you that I
had a collection of basic",00:11:50.310,00:11:53.700
formulas written on the board.,00:11:53.700,00:11:55.090
"And I want to just make sure
we know all of them again.",00:11:55.090,00:12:00.700
"So, first of all, there was
sine x is approximately x.",00:12:00.700,00:12:07.580
"Cosine x is approximately
1 - 1/2 x^2.",00:12:07.580,00:12:12.610
"And e ^ x is approximately
1 x 1/2 x^2.",00:12:12.610,00:12:19.230
"So those were three that
I mentioned last time.",00:12:19.230,00:12:22.230
"And, again, this is
all for x near 0.",00:12:22.230,00:12:28.980
All for x near 0 only.,00:12:28.980,00:12:31.160
"These are wildly wrong, Far
away, but near 0 they're nice,",00:12:31.160,00:12:35.760
"good, quadratic approximations.",00:12:35.760,00:12:37.730
"Now, the other two
approximations that I want to",00:12:37.730,00:12:39.800
"mention are the logarithm and we
use the base point shifted.",00:12:39.800,00:12:46.960
So we can put it at x near 0.,00:12:46.960,00:12:50.500
"And this one - sorry,
this is an",00:12:50.500,00:12:51.630
approximately equals sign there.,00:12:51.630,00:12:55.420
Turns out to be x - 1/2 x^2.,00:12:55.420,00:12:59.410
"And the last one is one (1 x)
^ r, which turns out to be 1",00:12:59.410,00:13:07.350
rx r ( r - 1) / 2x^2.,00:13:07.350,00:13:14.480
"Now, eventually, your mind will
converge on all of these",00:13:14.480,00:13:19.980
"and you'll find them relatively
easy to memorize.",00:13:19.980,00:13:23.380
"But it'll take some
getting used to.",00:13:23.380,00:13:25.820
"And I'm not claiming that you
should recognize them and",00:13:25.820,00:13:30.000
understand them all now.,00:13:30.000,00:13:32.370
"But I'm going to put a giant
box around this.",00:13:32.370,00:13:35.630
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:13:35.630,00:13:42.150
PROF.,00:13:42.150,00:13:42.293
JERISON: Yes.,00:13:42.293,00:13:42.580
"So the question was, you get all
of these if you use that",00:13:42.580,00:13:45.625
equation there.,00:13:45.625,00:13:45.775
"That's exactly what are you
going to do. so I already did",00:13:45.775,00:13:48.920
"it actually for these
three, last time.",00:13:48.920,00:13:52.350
"But I didn't do it yet
for these two.",00:13:52.350,00:13:55.880
"But I will do it in
about two minutes.",00:13:55.880,00:13:58.490
"Well, maybe five minutes.",00:13:58.490,00:14:00.405
"But first I want to explain just
a few things about these.",00:14:00.405,00:14:10.410
"They all follow from
the basic formula.",00:14:10.410,00:14:12.850
"In fact, that one deserves a
pink box too, doesn't it.",00:14:12.850,00:14:16.780
That one's pretty important.,00:14:16.780,00:14:18.020
Alright.,00:14:18.020,00:14:19.770
Yeah.,00:14:19.770,00:14:23.020
"Maybe even some little
sparkles.",00:14:23.020,00:14:25.100
Alright.,00:14:25.100,00:14:32.830
OK.,00:14:32.830,00:14:33.430
So that's pretty important.,00:14:33.430,00:14:36.390
"Almost as important as
the more basic one",00:14:36.390,00:14:38.450
without this term here.,00:14:38.450,00:14:41.190
"So now, let me just tell you
a little bit more about the",00:14:41.190,00:14:47.880
significance.,00:14:47.880,00:14:54.740
"Again, this is just to reinforce
something that we've",00:14:54.740,00:14:57.050
already done.,00:14:57.050,00:14:57.640
"But it's closely related to
what you're doing on your",00:14:57.640,00:14:59.780
problem set.,00:14:59.780,00:15:00.880
"So it's worth your while
to recall this.",00:15:00.880,00:15:05.230
"So, there's this expression
that we were dealing with.",00:15:05.230,00:15:10.870
"And we talked about
it in lecture.",00:15:10.870,00:15:13.370
"And we showed that this tends
to e as k goes to infinity.",00:15:13.370,00:15:19.900
"So that's what we showed
in lecture.",00:15:19.900,00:15:21.110
"And the way that we did that
was, we took the logarithm and",00:15:21.110,00:15:25.460
"we wrote it as k times, sorry,
the ln of 1 (1 / k).",00:15:25.460,00:15:32.530
"And then we evaluated
the limit of this.",00:15:32.530,00:15:35.780
"And I want to do this limit
again, using linear",00:15:35.780,00:15:39.220
approximation.,00:15:39.220,00:15:40.220
To show you how easy it is.,00:15:40.220,00:15:41.850
"If you just remember the
linear approximation.",00:15:41.850,00:15:44.820
"And then we'll explain
where the quadratic",00:15:44.820,00:15:46.630
approximation comes in.,00:15:46.630,00:15:48.390
"So I claim that this
is approximately",00:15:48.390,00:15:51.770
equal to k ( 1 / k).,00:15:51.770,00:15:59.300
"Now, why is that?",00:15:59.300,00:16:00.750
"Well, that's just this
linear approximation.",00:16:00.750,00:16:04.350
So what did I use here?,00:16:04.350,00:16:05.500
"I used ln of 1 x is
approximately x.",00:16:05.500,00:16:10.600
For x = 1 / k.,00:16:10.600,00:16:14.760
"That's what I used in this
approximation here.",00:16:14.760,00:16:18.600
"And that's the linear
approximation",00:16:18.600,00:16:20.330
to the natural logarithm.,00:16:20.330,00:16:24.010
"And this number is relatively
easy to evaluate.",00:16:24.010,00:16:27.250
I know how to do it.,00:16:27.250,00:16:28.150
It's equal to 1.,00:16:28.150,00:16:31.010
"That's the same, well, so
where does this work?",00:16:31.010,00:16:34.680
"This works where this
thing is near 0.",00:16:34.680,00:16:37.450
"Which is when k is going
to infinity.",00:16:37.450,00:16:41.610
"This thing is working only when
k is going to infinity.",00:16:41.610,00:16:44.170
"So what it's really saying, this
approximation formula,",00:16:44.170,00:16:46.660
"it's really saying that as we
go to infinity, in k, this",00:16:46.660,00:16:50.910
thing is going to 1.,00:16:50.910,00:16:54.720
As k goes to infinity.,00:16:54.720,00:16:58.890
So that's what it's saying.,00:16:58.890,00:17:00.410
That's the substance there.,00:17:00.410,00:17:01.740
"And that's how we want to use
it, in many instances.",00:17:01.740,00:17:05.200
Just to evaluate limits.,00:17:05.200,00:17:06.580
"We also want to realize that
it's nearby when k is pretty",00:17:06.580,00:17:10.000
"large, like 100 or something
like that.",00:17:10.000,00:17:12.800
"Now, so that's the idea of
the linear approximation.",00:17:12.800,00:17:16.660
"Now, if you want to get the rate
of convergence here, so",00:17:16.660,00:17:22.120
"the rate of what's called
convergence.",00:17:22.120,00:17:27.950
"So convergence means how fast
this is going towards that.",00:17:27.950,00:17:34.260
"What I have to do is take
the difference.",00:17:34.260,00:17:36.220
"I have to take ln ak, and I have
to subtract 1 from it.",00:17:36.220,00:17:40.670
"And I know that this is going to
0, and the question is how",00:17:40.670,00:17:43.860
big is this.,00:17:43.860,00:17:47.870
We want it to be very small.,00:17:47.870,00:17:51.760
"And the answer we're going to
get, so the answer just uses",00:17:51.760,00:17:56.810
the quadratic approximation.,00:17:56.810,00:18:03.570
"So if I just have a little bit
more detail, then this",00:18:03.570,00:18:06.750
"expression here, in other words,
I have the next higher",00:18:06.750,00:18:10.580
order term.,00:18:10.580,00:18:11.210
"This is like 1 / k, this
is like 1 / k^2.",00:18:11.210,00:18:15.420
"Then I can understand how big
the difference is between the",00:18:15.420,00:18:21.100
"expression that I've
got and its limit.",00:18:21.100,00:18:24.260
"And so that's what's
on your homework.",00:18:24.260,00:18:26.200
This is on your problem set.,00:18:26.200,00:18:31.610
"OK, so that is more or less an
explanation for one of the",00:18:31.610,00:18:35.210
"things that quadratic
approximations are good for.",00:18:35.210,00:18:38.860
"And I'm going to give you
one more illustration.",00:18:38.860,00:18:42.900
One more illustration.,00:18:42.900,00:18:45.360
"And then we'll actually
check these formulas.",00:18:45.360,00:18:47.580
"Yeah, another question.",00:18:47.580,00:18:48.430
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:18:48.430,00:18:55.940
PROF.,00:18:55.940,00:18:56.020
"JERISON: That's a very
good question here.",00:18:56.020,00:18:58.470
"When they, which in this case
means maybe, me, when I give",00:18:58.470,00:19:02.520
"you a question, does one specify
whether you want to",00:19:02.520,00:19:11.020
"use a linear or a quadratic
approximation.",00:19:11.020,00:19:14.430
"The answer is, in real life
when you're faced with a",00:19:14.430,00:19:18.920
"problem like this, where some
satellite is orbiting and you",00:19:18.920,00:19:23.130
"want to know the effects of
gravity or something like",00:19:23.130,00:19:25.330
"that, nobody is going to
tell you anything.",00:19:25.330,00:19:28.780
"They're not even going to tell
you whether a linear",00:19:28.780,00:19:30.320
"approximation is relevant, or
a quadratic or anything.",00:19:30.320,00:19:33.740
So you're on your own.,00:19:33.740,00:19:36.170
"When I give you a question, at
least for right now, I'm",00:19:36.170,00:19:40.290
always going to tell you.,00:19:40.290,00:19:42.640
"But as time goes on I'd like you
to get used to when it's",00:19:42.640,00:19:47.050
"enough to get away with a
linear approximation.",00:19:47.050,00:19:49.840
"And you should only use a
quadratic approximation if",00:19:49.840,00:19:53.720
somebody forces you to.,00:19:53.720,00:19:55.690
"You should always start trying
with a linear one.",00:19:55.690,00:19:57.960
"Because the quadratic ones are
much more complicated as",00:19:57.960,00:20:00.480
"you'll see in this
next example.",00:20:00.480,00:20:03.390
"OK, so the example that I want
to use is, you're going to be",00:20:03.390,00:20:06.660
"stuck with it because I'm asking
for the quadratic.",00:20:06.660,00:20:09.110
"So we're going to find the
quadratic approximation near,",00:20:09.110,00:20:17.450
for x near 0.,00:20:17.450,00:20:23.740
To what?,00:20:23.740,00:20:24.525
"Well, this is the same function
that we used in the",00:20:24.525,00:20:29.490
last lecture.,00:20:29.490,00:20:30.840
"I think this was it. e
^ - 3x (1 x) ^ - 1/2.",00:20:30.840,00:20:37.460
OK.,00:20:37.460,00:20:40.670
"So, unfortunately, I stuck it in
the wrong place to be able",00:20:40.670,00:20:45.390
"to fit this very long
formula here.",00:20:45.390,00:20:47.620
So I'm going to switch it.,00:20:47.620,00:20:51.100
"I'm just going to
write it here.",00:20:51.100,00:20:57.070
"And we're going to just
do the approximation.",00:20:57.070,00:21:00.140
"So we're going to say quadratic,
in parentheses.",00:21:00.140,00:21:03.830
And we'll say x near 0.,00:21:03.830,00:21:08.450
So that's what I want.,00:21:08.450,00:21:12.160
"So now, here's what
I have to do.",00:21:12.160,00:21:15.520
"Well, I have to write in the
quadratic approximation for e",00:21:15.520,00:21:18.310
"^ - 3x, and I'm going to use
this formula right here.",00:21:18.310,00:21:25.710
"And so that's (1 (-
3x) (- 3x)^2 / 2).",00:21:25.710,00:21:33.970
"And the other factor, I'm going
to have to use this",00:21:33.970,00:21:38.670
"formula down here. because
r is - 1/2.",00:21:38.670,00:21:43.460
"And so that's (1 - 1/2 x 1/2
( - 1/2)( - 3/2)x^2).",00:21:43.460,00:21:53.040
"So this is the r term, and
this is the r - 1 term.",00:21:59.090,00:22:09.970
"And now I'm going to do
something which is the only",00:22:09.970,00:22:12.750
"good thing about quadratic
approximations.",00:22:12.750,00:22:15.550
"They're messy, they're long,
there's nothing particularly",00:22:15.550,00:22:18.500
good about them.,00:22:18.500,00:22:19.450
"But there is one good
thing about them.",00:22:19.450,00:22:21.670
"Which is that you always get
to ignore the higher order",00:22:21.670,00:22:25.110
"terms. So even though this
looks like a very ugly",00:22:25.110,00:22:27.980
"multiplication, I can
do it in my head.",00:22:27.980,00:22:31.590
Just watching it.,00:22:31.590,00:22:33.940
"Because I get a 1 * 1, I'm
forced with that term here.",00:22:33.940,00:22:38.710
"And then I get the cross terms
which are linear, which is -",00:22:38.710,00:22:42.070
3x - 1/2 x.,00:22:42.070,00:22:44.150
"We already did that when we
calculated the linear",00:22:44.150,00:22:46.920
"approximation, so that's
this times the 1 and",00:22:46.920,00:22:50.260
this times that 1.,00:22:50.260,00:22:51.670
And now I have three,00:22:51.670,00:22:53.100
cross-terms which are quadratic.,00:22:53.100,00:22:55.230
"So one of them is these two
linear terms are multiplying.",00:22:55.230,00:22:58.880
So that's plus 3/2 x^2.,00:22:58.880,00:23:02.160
That's (- 3)( - 1/2).,00:23:02.160,00:23:05.210
"And then there's this term,
multiplying the 1,",00:23:05.210,00:23:08.160
that's plus 9/2 x^2.,00:23:08.160,00:23:11.730
"And then there's one
last term, which is",00:23:11.730,00:23:13.090
this monster here.,00:23:13.090,00:23:15.080
"Multiplying 1, and
that is - 3/8.",00:23:15.080,00:23:23.260
"So the great thing is, we drop
x^3, x ^ 4, etc., terms. Yeah?",00:23:23.260,00:23:37.930

"JERISON: OK, well
so copy it down.",00:23:40.156,00:23:42.500
"And you work it out as
I'm doing it now.",00:23:42.500,00:23:45.620
"So what I did is, I
multiplied 1 by 1.",00:23:45.620,00:23:47.930
"I'm using the distributive
law here.",00:23:47.930,00:23:50.290
That was this one.,00:23:50.290,00:23:51.560
"I multiplied this 3x by this
one, that was that term.",00:23:51.560,00:23:55.120
"I multiplied this by this,
that's that term.",00:23:55.120,00:23:58.550
"And then I multiplied
this by this.",00:23:58.550,00:24:01.120
"In other words, 2 x terms
that gave me an x^2",00:24:01.120,00:24:03.860
and a (- 3)( - 1/2).,00:24:03.860,00:24:06.940
"And I'm going to stop
at that point.",00:24:06.940,00:24:08.720
"Because the point is it's
just all the rest of the",00:24:08.720,00:24:10.440
terms that come up.,00:24:10.440,00:24:12.230
"Now, the reason, the only reason
why it's easy is that I",00:24:12.230,00:24:14.600
"only have to go up to
x squared term.",00:24:14.600,00:24:16.170
"I don't have to do
the higher ones.",00:24:16.170,00:24:21.600
"Another question,
way back here.",00:24:21.600,00:24:22.795
"Yeah, right there.",00:24:22.795,00:24:23.420

JERISON: OK.,00:24:29.196,00:24:29.550
"So somebody can check
my arithmetic, too.",00:24:29.550,00:24:38.690
Good.,00:24:38.690,00:24:39.470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:24:39.470,00:24:40.630
PROF.,00:24:40.630,00:24:40.861
"JERISON: Why do I get to drop
all the higher-order terms.",00:24:40.861,00:24:43.466
"So, that's because the situation
where I'm going to",00:24:43.466,00:24:46.600
"apply this is the situation
in which x is, say, 1/100.",00:24:46.600,00:24:52.610
So if here's about 1/100.,00:24:52.610,00:24:55.030
"Here's something which is
on the order of 100.",00:24:55.030,00:24:57.210
"This is on the order
of 1/100^2.",00:24:57.210,00:25:00.130
"1/100^2, all of these terms.
Now, these cubic and quartic",00:25:00.130,00:25:05.220
"terms are of the order
of 1/100^3.",00:25:05.220,00:25:10.520
That's 10 ^ - 6.,00:25:10.520,00:25:12.420
"And the point is that I'm
not claiming that I",00:25:12.420,00:25:14.870
have an exact answer.,00:25:14.870,00:25:16.230
"And I'm going to drop things
of that order of magnitude.",00:25:16.230,00:25:19.950
"So I'm saving everything
up to 4 decimal places.",00:25:19.950,00:25:22.890
"I'm throwing away things which
are 6 decimal places out.",00:25:22.890,00:25:29.300
"Does that answer
your question?",00:25:29.300,00:25:30.870
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:25:30.870,00:25:35.380
PROF.,00:25:35.380,00:25:35.710
JERISON: So.,00:25:35.710,00:25:36.370
"That's the situation, and now
you can combine the terms. I",00:25:36.370,00:25:39.850
"mean, it's not very
impressive here.",00:25:39.850,00:25:43.780
"This is equal to 1 - 7/2
x, maybe 51/8 x^2.",00:25:43.780,00:25:54.300
"If I've made that, if those
minus signs hadn't canceled, I",00:25:54.300,00:25:57.610
"would have gotten the
wrong answer here.",00:25:57.610,00:25:59.560
Anyway.,00:25:59.560,00:26:00.140
"So, this is a 2 here, sorry.",00:26:00.140,00:26:03.430
7/2.,00:26:03.430,00:26:04.920
"This is the linear approximation
we got last time",00:26:04.920,00:26:07.940
"and here's the extra information
that we got from",00:26:07.940,00:26:09.970
this calculation.,00:26:09.970,00:26:11.540
Which is this 51/8 term.,00:26:11.540,00:26:17.650
"Right, you have to accept that
there's a certain degree of",00:26:17.650,00:26:20.500
"complexity to this problem and
the answer is sufficiently",00:26:20.500,00:26:23.220
"complicated so it can't be less
arithmetic because we get",00:26:23.220,00:26:25.900
"this peculiar 51/8
there, right.",00:26:25.900,00:26:29.380
"So one of the things to realize
is that these kinds of",00:26:29.380,00:26:33.090
"problems, because they involve
many, many terms are always",00:26:33.090,00:26:37.050
"going to involve a little bit
of complicated arithmetic.",00:26:37.050,00:26:43.960
"Last little bit, I did promise
you that I was going to derive",00:26:43.960,00:26:48.740
"these two relations,
as I said.",00:26:48.740,00:26:51.360
"Did the ones in the
left column.",00:26:51.360,00:26:53.020
So let's carry that out.,00:26:53.020,00:26:56.640
"And as someone just pointed out,
it all comes from this",00:26:56.640,00:27:00.840
formula here.,00:27:00.840,00:27:01.900
So let's just check it.,00:27:01.900,00:27:07.710
"So we'll start with
the ln function.",00:27:07.710,00:27:12.160
"This is the function, f,
and then f' is 1/1 x.",00:27:12.160,00:27:18.810
"And f'', so this is f', this
is f'', is - 1/1 x^2.",00:27:18.810,00:27:25.030
"And now I have to
plug in x = 0.",00:27:28.160,00:27:31.730
"So at x = 0 this is
ln 1, which is 0.",00:27:31.730,00:27:35.180
So this is at x = 0.,00:27:35.180,00:27:37.860
"I'm getting 0 here, I plug
in 0 and I get 1.",00:27:37.860,00:27:41.850
"And here, I plug in
0 and I get - 1.",00:27:41.850,00:27:45.720
"So now I go and I look up at
that formula, which is way in",00:27:45.720,00:27:49.110
that upper corner there.,00:27:49.110,00:27:50.270
"And I see that the coefficient
on the constant is 0.",00:27:50.270,00:27:53.420
The coefficient on x is 1.,00:27:53.420,00:27:55.260
"And then the other coefficient,
the very last",00:27:55.260,00:27:57.160
"one, is - 1/2.",00:27:57.160,00:27:59.290
So this is the - 1 here.,00:27:59.290,00:28:01.010
"And then in the formula,
there's a 2 in the",00:28:01.010,00:28:04.720
denominator.,00:28:04.720,00:28:05.340
"So it's half of whatever
I get for this second",00:28:05.340,00:28:07.820
"derivative, at 0.",00:28:07.820,00:28:10.590
"So this is the approximation
formula, which is way up in",00:28:10.590,00:28:13.870
that corner there.,00:28:13.870,00:28:17.260
"Similarly, if I do it for
(1 x) ^ r, I have to",00:28:17.260,00:28:21.590
"differentiate that I get r( 1
x) ^ r - 1, and then r ( r -",00:28:21.590,00:28:27.630
1( x 1) ^ r - 2.,00:28:27.630,00:28:31.270
So here are the derivatives.,00:28:31.270,00:28:33.830
"And so if I evaluate them
at x = 0, I get 1.",00:28:33.830,00:28:41.110
That's 1 ^ r = 1.,00:28:41.110,00:28:43.240
"And here I get r.
(1 ^ r - 1)r.",00:28:43.240,00:28:49.580
"And here, I plug in x = 0
and I get r ( r - 1).",00:28:49.580,00:28:59.790
"So again, the pattern is
right above it here.",00:28:59.790,00:29:02.880
"The 1 is there, the
r is there.",00:29:02.880,00:29:05.300
"And then instead of r ( r
- 1), I have half that.",00:29:05.300,00:29:08.920
For the coefficient.,00:29:08.920,00:29:21.480
So these are just examples.,00:29:21.480,00:29:22.660
"Obviously if we had a more
complicated functional, we",00:29:22.660,00:29:24.975
might carry this out.,00:29:24.975,00:29:26.050
"But as a practical matter, we
try to stick with the ones in",00:29:26.050,00:29:29.810
"the pink box and just use
algebra to get other formulas.",00:29:29.810,00:29:42.460
"So I want to shift gears now and
treat the subject that was",00:29:42.460,00:29:46.430
supposed to be this lecture.,00:29:46.430,00:29:48.910
"And we're not quite caught up,
but we will try to do our best",00:29:48.910,00:29:53.080
to do as much as we can today.,00:29:53.080,00:29:54.890
"So the next topic is
curve sketching.",00:29:54.890,00:29:59.880
"And so let's get started
with that.",00:29:59.880,00:30:18.120
"So now, happily in this subject,
there are more",00:30:18.120,00:30:23.630
"pictures and it's a little
bit more geometric.",00:30:23.630,00:30:26.880
"And there's relatively
little computation.",00:30:26.880,00:30:30.420
So let's hope we can do this.,00:30:30.420,00:30:33.600
"So I want to, so here
we go, we'll",00:30:33.600,00:30:36.890
start with curve sketching.,00:30:36.890,00:30:44.930
And the goal here,00:30:44.930,00:30:47.520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:30:47.520,00:30:56.860
PROF.,00:30:56.860,00:30:56.910
"JERISON: So that's like,
liner, the last time.",00:30:56.910,00:31:00.880
"That's kind of sketchy
spelling, isn't it?",00:31:00.880,00:31:09.600
"Yeah, there are certain kinds of
things which I can't spell.",00:31:09.600,00:31:12.800
"But, alright.",00:31:12.800,00:31:16.640
Sketching.,00:31:16.640,00:31:18.970
Alright.,00:31:18.970,00:31:19.240
So here's our goal.,00:31:19.240,00:31:21.350
"Our goal is to draw the graph
of f, using f' and f''.",00:31:21.350,00:31:38.280
"Whether they're positive
or negative.",00:31:42.380,00:31:47.190
So that's it.,00:31:47.190,00:31:48.440
This is the goal here.,00:31:48.440,00:31:52.400
"However, there is a
big warning that I",00:31:52.400,00:31:56.120
want to give you.,00:31:56.120,00:31:57.020
"And this is one that
unfortunately I now have to",00:31:57.020,00:32:06.170
"make you unlearn, especially
those that you that have",00:32:06.170,00:32:08.040
"actually had a little bit of
calculus before, I want to",00:32:08.040,00:32:10.910
"make you unlearn some of your
instincts that you developed.",00:32:10.910,00:32:13.720
"So this will be harder for those
of you who have actually",00:32:13.720,00:32:15.670
done this before.,00:32:15.670,00:32:19.840
"But for the rest of you, it
will be relatively easy.",00:32:19.840,00:32:22.650
"Which is, don't abandon your
precalculus skills.",00:32:22.650,00:32:35.490
And common sense.,00:32:35.490,00:32:42.380
"So there's a great deal of
common sense in this.",00:32:42.380,00:32:46.760
"And it actually trumps
some of the calculus.",00:32:46.760,00:32:50.555
"The calculus just fills
in what you",00:32:50.555,00:32:53.850
didn't quite know yet.,00:32:53.850,00:32:56.190
"So I will try to illustrate
this.",00:32:56.190,00:32:59.660
"And because we're running a bit
late, I won't get to the",00:32:59.660,00:33:02.690
"some of the main punchlines
until next lecture.",00:33:02.690,00:33:05.970
But I want you to do it.,00:33:05.970,00:33:07.380
"So for now, I'm just going to
tell you about the general",00:33:07.380,00:33:10.120
principles.,00:33:10.120,00:33:10.620
"And in the process I'm going to
introduce the terminology.",00:33:10.620,00:33:14.100
"Just, the words that we need
to use to describe what is",00:33:14.100,00:33:17.470
that we're doing.,00:33:17.470,00:33:18.000
"And there's also a certain
amount of carelessness with",00:33:18.000,00:33:20.150
"that in many of the treatments
that you'll see.",00:33:20.150,00:33:23.070
And a lot of hastiness.,00:33:23.070,00:33:24.750
"So just be a little patient
and we will do this.",00:33:24.750,00:33:29.350
"So, the first principle
is the following.",00:33:29.350,00:33:33.740
"If f' is positive, then
f is increasing.",00:33:33.740,00:33:40.670
"That's a straightforward idea,
and it's closely related to",00:33:40.670,00:33:44.630
"this tangent line approximation
or the linear",00:33:44.630,00:33:47.330
approximation that I just did.,00:33:47.330,00:33:49.220
You can just imagine.,00:33:49.220,00:33:50.230
"Here's the tangent line,
here's the function.",00:33:50.230,00:33:53.050
"And if the tangent line is
pointing up, then the function",00:33:53.050,00:33:56.310
"is also going up, too.",00:33:56.310,00:33:58.490
"So that's all that's
going on here.",00:33:58.490,00:34:00.310
"Similarly, if f' is negative,
then f is decreasing.",00:34:00.310,00:34:10.370
And that's the basic idea.,00:34:10.370,00:34:12.220
"Now, the second step is also
fairly straightforward.",00:34:12.220,00:34:17.170
"It's just a second order effect
of the same type.",00:34:17.170,00:34:21.130
"If you have f'' as positive,
then that means that f' is",00:34:21.130,00:34:29.190
increasing.,00:34:29.190,00:34:33.150
"That's the same principle
applied one step up.",00:34:33.150,00:34:36.740
Right?,00:34:36.740,00:34:37.320
"Because if f'' is positive,
that means it's the",00:34:37.320,00:34:41.470
derivative of f'.,00:34:41.470,00:34:42.710
"So it's the same principle
just repeated.",00:34:42.710,00:34:45.970
"And now I just want to draw
a picture of this.",00:34:45.970,00:34:49.710
"Here's a picture
of it, I claim.",00:34:49.710,00:34:52.470
"And it looks like something's
going down.",00:34:52.470,00:34:54.790
And I did that on purpose.,00:34:54.790,00:34:56.430
"But there is something that's
increasing here.",00:34:56.430,00:34:58.650
"Which is, the slope is very
steep negative here.",00:34:58.650,00:35:02.470
"And it's less steep negative
over here.",00:35:02.470,00:35:06.330
"So we have the slope which
is some negative",00:35:06.330,00:35:08.940
"number, say, - 4.",00:35:08.940,00:35:10.135
And here it's - 3.,00:35:10.135,00:35:13.500
So it's increasing.,00:35:13.500,00:35:14.800
"It's getting less negative,
and maybe eventually it'll",00:35:14.800,00:35:18.250
curve up the other way.,00:35:18.250,00:35:19.680
"And this is a picture of what
I'm talking about here.",00:35:19.680,00:35:23.180
"That's what it means to say
that f' is increasing.",00:35:23.180,00:35:25.630
The slope is getting larger.,00:35:25.630,00:35:28.020
"And the way to describe a curve
like this is that it's",00:35:28.020,00:35:32.610
concave. So f is concave up.,00:35:32.610,00:35:41.620
"And similarly, f'' negative is
going to be the same thing as",00:35:41.620,00:35:48.520
"f concave, or implies
f concave down.",00:35:48.520,00:35:59.770
"So those are the ways in which
derivatives will help us",00:35:59.770,00:36:04.850
qualitatively to draw graphs.,00:36:04.850,00:36:08.270
"But as I said before, we still
have to use a little bit of",00:36:08.270,00:36:10.950
"common sense when we
draw the graphs.",00:36:10.950,00:36:13.360
"These are just the additional
bits of help that",00:36:13.360,00:36:15.800
we have from calculus.,00:36:15.800,00:36:17.850
In drawing pictures.,00:36:17.850,00:36:25.410
"So I'm going to go through
one example to",00:36:25.410,00:36:34.260
introduce all the notations.,00:36:34.260,00:36:36.190
"And then eventually, so probably
at the beginning of",00:36:36.190,00:36:40.970
"next time, I'll give you a
systematic strategy that's",00:36:40.970,00:36:45.510
"going to work when what I'm
describing now goes wrong, or",00:36:45.510,00:36:49.890
a little bit wrong.,00:36:49.890,00:36:52.360
"So let's begin with a
straightforward example.",00:36:52.360,00:36:58.730
"So, the first example that I'll
give you is the function",00:36:58.730,00:37:01.360
f (x) = 3x - x^3.,00:37:01.360,00:37:04.690
"Just, as I said, to be able to
introduce all the notations.",00:37:07.520,00:37:11.130
"Now, if you differentiate
it, you get 3 - 3x^2.",00:37:11.130,00:37:17.640
And I can factor that.,00:37:17.640,00:37:20.970
This is 3 ( 1 - x)( 1 x).,00:37:20.970,00:37:26.440
OK?,00:37:26.440,00:37:27.750
"And so, I can decide whether
the derivative",00:37:27.750,00:37:33.140
is positive or negative.,00:37:33.140,00:37:37.390
Easily enough.,00:37:37.390,00:37:38.830
"Namely, just staring at this,
I can see that when -1 &lt; x &lt;",00:37:38.830,00:37:49.520
"1, in that range there, both
these numbers, both these",00:37:49.520,00:37:53.150
"factors, are positive.",00:37:53.150,00:37:55.360
"1 - x is a positive number and
1 x is a positive number.",00:37:55.360,00:37:59.290
"So, in this range, f'
( x ) is positive.",00:37:59.290,00:38:04.710
"So this thing is, so
f is increasing.",00:38:04.710,00:38:09.700
"And similarly, in the other
ranges, if x is very, very",00:38:09.700,00:38:14.540
"large, this becomes, if it
crosses 1, in fact, this",00:38:14.540,00:38:17.290
"becomes, this factor becomes
negative and",00:38:17.290,00:38:19.570
this one stays positive.,00:38:19.570,00:38:21.310
"So when x &gt; 1, we have that
f ' (x) is negative.",00:38:21.310,00:38:29.680
And so f is decreasing.,00:38:29.680,00:38:35.510
"And the same thing goes
for the other side.",00:38:35.510,00:38:39.540
"When it's less than - 1, that
also works this way.",00:38:39.540,00:38:42.500
"Because when it's less
than - 1, this",00:38:42.500,00:38:44.950
number factors positive.,00:38:44.950,00:38:46.420
But the other one is negative.,00:38:46.420,00:38:50.300
"So in both of these cases, we
get that it's decreasing.",00:38:50.300,00:38:56.290
"So now, here's the schematic
picture of this function.",00:38:56.290,00:39:07.300
"So here's - 1, here's 1.",00:39:07.300,00:39:12.950
"It's going to go
down, up, down.",00:39:12.950,00:39:19.840
That's what it's doing.,00:39:19.840,00:39:21.590
"Maybe I'll just leave
it alone like this.",00:39:21.590,00:39:23.710
That's what it looks like.,00:39:23.710,00:39:28.120
"So, this is the kind of
information we can get right",00:39:28.120,00:39:32.050
off the bat.,00:39:32.050,00:39:32.980
"And you notice immediately that
it's very important, from",00:39:32.980,00:39:38.415
"the features of the function,
the sort of key features of",00:39:38.415,00:39:40.560
"the function that we see here,
are these two places.",00:39:40.560,00:39:44.690
"Maybe I'll even mark them
in a, like this.",00:39:44.690,00:39:49.270
"And these things are
turning points.",00:39:49.270,00:39:59.090
So what are they?,00:39:59.090,00:40:00.430
"Well, they're just the
points where the",00:40:00.430,00:40:03.990
derivative changes sign.,00:40:03.990,00:40:05.800
"Where it's negative here and
it's positive there, so there",00:40:05.800,00:40:08.105
it must be 0.,00:40:08.105,00:40:09.850
"So we have a definition, and
this is the most important",00:40:09.850,00:40:12.830
"definition in this subject,
which is that is if f' (x0) =",00:40:12.830,00:40:21.110
"0, we call x0 a critical
point.",00:40:21.110,00:40:33.370
"The word 'turning point' is
not used just because, in",00:40:33.370,00:40:36.360
"fact, it doesn't have to turn
around at those points.",00:40:36.360,00:40:38.880
"But certainly, if it turns
around then this will happen.",00:40:38.880,00:40:42.710
"And we also have another
notation, which is the number",00:40:42.710,00:40:46.160
"y0 which is f ( x0 ) is called
a critical value.",00:40:46.160,00:40:59.100
"So these are the key numbers
that we're going to have to",00:40:59.100,00:41:02.680
"work out in order to understand
what the function",00:41:02.680,00:41:06.010
looks like.,00:41:06.010,00:41:18.750
"So what I'm going to do
is just plot them.",00:41:18.750,00:41:27.990
"We're going to plot
the critical",00:41:27.990,00:41:29.220
points and the values.,00:41:29.220,00:41:30.440
"Well, we found the critical
points relatively easily.",00:41:30.440,00:41:34.650
"I didn't write it down here
but it's pretty obvious.",00:41:34.650,00:41:37.240
"If you set f(x) = 0, that
implies that (1 - x)( 1 x) =",00:41:37.240,00:41:45.230
"0, which implies that
x is or - 1.",00:41:45.230,00:41:50.570
"So those are known as
the critical points.",00:41:50.570,00:41:52.710
"And now, in order to get the
critical values here, I have",00:41:52.710,00:41:56.720
"to plug in f (1), for instance,
the function is 3x -",00:41:56.720,00:42:02.280
"x^2, so there's this 3 *
1 - 1^3, which is 2.",00:42:02.280,00:42:07.480
"And f ( - 1), which is 3 ( -
1) - (- 1)^3, which is - 2.",00:42:07.480,00:42:17.180
"And so I can plot the
function here.",00:42:17.180,00:42:21.780
"So here's the point - 1 and
here's, up here, is 2.",00:42:21.780,00:42:26.160
"So this is - whoops,
which one is it?",00:42:26.160,00:42:28.620
Yeah.,00:42:28.620,00:42:29.160
"This is - 1, so it's
down here.",00:42:29.160,00:42:32.560
"So it's (- 1, - 2).",00:42:32.560,00:42:35.160
"And then over here, I have
the point (1, 2).",00:42:35.160,00:42:41.570
"Alright, now, what information
do I get from - so I've now",00:42:41.570,00:42:47.320
"plotted two, I claim, very
interesting points.",00:42:47.320,00:42:50.630
"What information do
I get from this?",00:42:50.630,00:42:55.000
"The answer is, I know something
very nearby.",00:42:55.000,00:42:59.680
"Because I've already checked
that the thing is coming down",00:42:59.680,00:43:02.630
"from the left, and
coming back up.",00:43:02.630,00:43:04.770
"And so it must be shaped
like this.",00:43:04.770,00:43:07.370
Over here.,00:43:07.370,00:43:08.330
"The tangent line is 0, it's
going to be level there.",00:43:08.330,00:43:11.620
"And similarly over here,
it's going to do that.",00:43:11.620,00:43:14.490
"So this is what we know
so far, based",00:43:14.490,00:43:17.280
on what we've computed.,00:43:17.280,00:43:22.250
Question.,00:43:22.250,00:43:22.710

"JERISON: The question
is, what happens if",00:43:37.416,00:43:38.240
there's a sharp corner.,00:43:38.240,00:43:38.600
"The answer is, calculus, it's
not called a critical point.",00:43:38.600,00:43:45.050
It's a something else.,00:43:45.050,00:43:47.090
"And it's a very important
point, too.",00:43:47.090,00:43:50.440
"And we will be discussing
those kinds of points.",00:43:50.440,00:43:52.570
"There are much more dramatic
instances of that.",00:43:52.570,00:43:54.540
"That's part of what we're
going to say.",00:43:54.540,00:43:56.640
"But I just want to save
that, alright.",00:43:56.640,00:43:58.670
We will be discussing.,00:43:58.670,00:44:02.490
Yeah.,00:44:02.490,00:44:03.010
Question.,00:44:03.010,00:44:03.540
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE],00:44:03.540,00:44:08.140
PROF.,00:44:08.140,00:44:08.516
"JERISON: The question that was
asked was, how did I know at",00:44:08.516,00:44:11.330
"the critical point that it's
concave down over here and",00:44:11.330,00:44:14.960
concave up over here.,00:44:14.960,00:44:17.190
"The answer is that I actually
did not use the second",00:44:17.190,00:44:22.860
derivative yet.,00:44:22.860,00:44:24.300
"What I used is another
piece of information.",00:44:24.300,00:44:26.510
"I used the information that
I derived over here.",00:44:26.510,00:44:28.760
"That f' is positive, where
f' is positive",00:44:28.760,00:44:32.500
and where it's negative.,00:44:32.500,00:44:33.670
"So what I know is that the graph
is going down to the",00:44:33.670,00:44:37.220
left of - 1.,00:44:37.220,00:44:39.470
"It's going up to the
right, here.",00:44:39.470,00:44:41.530
"It's going up here and it's
going down there.",00:44:41.530,00:44:44.920
"I did not use the second
derivative.",00:44:44.920,00:44:47.060
I used the first derivative.,00:44:47.060,00:44:49.960
"OK, but I didn't just use the
fact that there was a turning",00:44:49.960,00:44:53.410
point here.,00:44:53.410,00:44:56.040
"So, actually, I was using
the fact that it",00:44:56.040,00:44:57.360
was a turning point.,00:44:57.360,00:44:58.210
"I wasn't using the fact
that it had the",00:44:58.210,00:45:00.200
"second derivative, though.",00:45:00.200,00:45:01.730
OK.,00:45:01.730,00:45:01.980
For now.,00:45:01.980,00:45:03.120
"You can also see it by the
second derivative as well.",00:45:03.120,00:45:09.500
"So now, the next thing that
I'd like to do, I need to",00:45:09.500,00:45:14.220
finish off this graph.,00:45:14.220,00:45:16.170
"And I just want to do it a
little bit carefully here.",00:45:16.170,00:45:19.950
"In the order that
is reasonable.",00:45:19.950,00:45:22.710
"Now, you might happen to notice,
and there's nothing",00:45:22.710,00:45:27.310
"wrong with this, so let's
even fill in a guess.",00:45:27.310,00:45:35.120
"In order to fill in a guess,
though, and have it be even",00:45:35.120,00:45:37.190
"vaguely right, I do have to
notice that this thing",00:45:37.190,00:45:39.080
"crosses, this function
crosses the origin.",00:45:39.080,00:45:41.800
"The function f(x) = 3x - x^3
happens also have the property",00:45:41.800,00:45:48.660
that f ( 0 ) = 0.,00:45:48.660,00:45:50.780
"Again, common sense.",00:45:50.780,00:45:52.560
"You're allowed to use
your common sense.",00:45:52.560,00:45:54.590
"You're allowed to notice
a value of the",00:45:54.590,00:45:56.250
function and put it in.,00:45:56.250,00:45:58.320
"So there's nothing
wrong with that.",00:45:58.320,00:46:00.270
"If you happen to have
such a value.",00:46:00.270,00:46:03.960
"So, now we can guess what
our function is",00:46:03.960,00:46:06.060
going to look like.,00:46:06.060,00:46:06.650
"It's going to maybe come
down like this.",00:46:06.650,00:46:10.010
Come up like this.,00:46:10.010,00:46:11.670
And come down like this.,00:46:11.670,00:46:13.130
"That could be what
it looks like.",00:46:13.130,00:46:15.230
"But, you know, another
possibility is it sort of",00:46:15.230,00:46:17.390
"comes along here and
goes out that way.",00:46:17.390,00:46:19.820
"Comes along here and goes
out that way, who knows?",00:46:19.820,00:46:22.260
"It happens, by the way, that
it's an odd function.",00:46:22.260,00:46:25.280
Right?,00:46:25.280,00:46:25.570
Those are all odd powers.,00:46:25.570,00:46:26.640
"So, actually, it's symmetric
on the right half",00:46:26.640,00:46:28.710
and the left half.,00:46:28.710,00:46:29.860
And crosses at 0.,00:46:29.860,00:46:31.610
"So everything that we do on the
right is going to be the",00:46:31.610,00:46:33.310
"same as what happens
on the left.",00:46:33.310,00:46:34.530
"That's another piece
of common sense.",00:46:34.530,00:46:36.620
"You want to make use of that as
much as possible, whenever",00:46:36.620,00:46:39.000
you're drawing anything.,00:46:39.000,00:46:40.060
"Don't want to throw
out information.",00:46:40.060,00:46:42.340
"So this function happens
to be odd.",00:46:42.340,00:46:46.540
"Odd, and f ( 0 ) = 0.",00:46:46.540,00:46:48.700
"I'm considering those to be
kinds of precalculus skills",00:46:48.700,00:46:52.520
"that I want you to use
as much as you can.",00:46:52.520,00:47:00.610
"So now, here's the first feature
which is unfortunately",00:47:00.610,00:47:03.990
"ignored in most discussions
of functions.",00:47:03.990,00:47:08.880
"And it's strange, because
nowadays we",00:47:08.880,00:47:11.340
have graphing things.,00:47:11.340,00:47:13.380
"And it's really the only part
of the exercise that you",00:47:13.380,00:47:19.410
"couldn't do, at least on this
relatively simpleminded level,",00:47:19.410,00:47:26.420
with a graphing calculator.,00:47:26.420,00:47:28.180
"And that is what I would call
the ends of the problem.",00:47:28.180,00:47:33.790
"So what happens off the screen,
is the question.",00:47:33.790,00:47:37.000
"And that basically is the
theoretical part of the",00:47:37.000,00:47:39.600
"problem that you have
to address.",00:47:39.600,00:47:41.430
You can program this.,00:47:41.430,00:47:42.920
"You can draw all the pictures
that you want.",00:47:42.920,00:47:45.410
"But what you won't see is
what's off the screen.",00:47:45.410,00:47:48.190
"You need to know something
to figure out",00:47:48.190,00:47:50.260
what's off the screen.,00:47:50.260,00:47:51.780
"So, in this case, I'm talking
about what's off the screen",00:47:51.780,00:47:54.560
"going to the right, or
going to the left.",00:47:54.560,00:48:01.930
So let's check the ends.,00:48:01.930,00:48:06.100
"So here, let's just
take a look.",00:48:06.100,00:48:07.680
"We have the function f(x), which
is, sorry, 3x - x^3.",00:48:07.680,00:48:12.280
"Again this is a precalculus
sort of thing.",00:48:12.280,00:48:14.620
"And we're imagining now,
let's just do x",00:48:14.620,00:48:16.650
goes to plus infinity.,00:48:16.650,00:48:18.360
So what happens here.,00:48:18.360,00:48:19.670
"When x is gigantic, this term
is completely negligible.",00:48:19.670,00:48:25.460
"And it just behaves like -
x^3, which goes to minus",00:48:25.460,00:48:29.410
"infinity as x goes
to plus infinity.",00:48:29.410,00:48:32.600
"And similarly, f (x) goes to
plus infinity if x goes to",00:48:32.600,00:48:42.170
minus infinity.,00:48:42.170,00:48:46.150
"Now let me pull down this
picture again, and show you",00:48:46.150,00:48:50.060
"what piece of the information
we've got.",00:48:50.060,00:48:53.140
"We now know that it is
heading up this way.",00:48:53.140,00:48:55.610
"It doesn't go like this,
it goes up like that.",00:48:55.610,00:48:58.560
"And I'm going to put an
arrow for it, And it's",00:48:58.560,00:49:00.470
going down like this.,00:49:00.470,00:49:02.580
"Heading down to minus infinity
as x goes out",00:49:02.580,00:49:06.210
farther to the right.,00:49:06.210,00:49:07.310
"And going out to plus infinity
as x goes farther to the left.",00:49:07.310,00:49:15.120
"So now there's hardly
anything left of",00:49:15.120,00:49:19.270
this function to describe.,00:49:19.270,00:49:21.910
"There's really nothing left
except maybe decoration.",00:49:21.910,00:49:27.120
"And we kind of like that
decoration, so we will pay",00:49:27.120,00:49:31.540
attention to it.,00:49:31.540,00:49:32.560
"And to do that, we'll have to
check the second derivative.",00:49:32.560,00:49:35.580
"So if we differentiate a
second time, the first",00:49:35.580,00:49:38.200
"derivative was, remember,
3 - 3x^2.",00:49:38.200,00:49:42.680
"So the second derivative
is - 6x.",00:49:42.680,00:49:53.540
"So now we notice that f'' (x) is
negative if x is positive.",00:49:53.540,00:50:02.470
"And f'' ( x) is positive
if x is negative.",00:50:02.470,00:50:08.310
"And so in this part
it's concave down.",00:50:08.310,00:50:13.170
"And in this part it's
concave up.",00:50:13.170,00:50:18.990
"And now I'm going to switch
the boards so that",00:50:18.990,00:50:21.170
"you'll, and draw it.",00:50:21.170,00:50:24.860
"And you see that it was begging
to be this way.",00:50:24.860,00:50:30.630
"So we'll fill in the
rest of it here.",00:50:30.630,00:50:32.960
Maybe in a nice color here.,00:50:32.960,00:50:35.560
"So this is the whole graph and
this is the correct graph.",00:50:35.560,00:50:38.100
"It comes down in one swoop down
here, and comes up here.",00:50:38.100,00:50:41.450
"And then it changes to concave
down right at the origin.",00:50:41.450,00:50:46.620
"So this point is of interest,
not only because it's the",00:50:46.620,00:50:49.670
"place where it crosses the axis,
but it's also what's",00:50:49.670,00:50:52.630
called an inflection point.,00:50:52.630,00:51:00.690
"Inflection point, that's a point
where because f'' at",00:51:00.690,00:51:04.170
that place is equal to 0.,00:51:04.170,00:51:07.620
"So it's a place where the
second derivative is 0.",00:51:07.620,00:51:10.970
"We also consider those to
be interesting points.",00:51:10.970,00:51:15.160
"Now, so let me just making
one closing remark here.",00:51:15.160,00:51:21.010
"Which is that all of this
information fits together.",00:51:21.010,00:51:26.590
"And we're going to have much,
much harder examples of this",00:51:26.590,00:51:29.610
"where you'll actually have to
think about what's going on.",00:51:29.610,00:51:32.570
"But there's a lot of stuff
protecting you.",00:51:32.570,00:51:35.190
"And functions will behave
themselves and turn around",00:51:35.190,00:51:39.990
appropriately.,00:51:39.990,00:51:40.920
"Anyway, we'll talk about
it next time.",00:51:40.920,00:51:43.570
