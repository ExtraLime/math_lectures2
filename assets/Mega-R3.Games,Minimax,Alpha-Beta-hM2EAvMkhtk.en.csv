"The main thing that you guys
want to talk about with games",00:00:29.724,00:00:32.140
"is how to do that
alpha-beta thing.",00:00:32.140,00:00:34.330
Because it's pretty confusing.,00:00:34.330,00:00:36.300

in a corner or something.",00:00:36.300,00:00:40.490
"Whereas doing the regular
minimax, in my experience,",00:00:40.490,00:00:43.820
most 6034 students can do that.,00:00:43.820,00:00:45.590
"And they do it right
pretty much all the time.",00:00:45.590,00:00:48.450
"However, we're going to focus
on all the different components",00:00:48.450,00:00:51.560

"It has nodes from
A through R. This",00:01:25.300,00:01:29.970
"is our standard
game tree from 6034.",00:01:29.970,00:01:33.250

up at the top",00:01:33.250,00:01:35.922
"who's trying to get the
highest score possible.",00:01:35.922,00:01:37.880
The minimizer is her opponent.,00:01:37.880,00:01:41.770

we can do regular minimax",00:02:01.180,00:02:06.130

and figure out the minimax",00:02:06.130,00:02:09.639
value at A.,00:02:09.639,00:02:11.270
So let's see how that works.,00:02:11.270,00:02:13.900
"All right, as you guys
remember, the game search",00:02:13.900,00:02:19.010
"when using regular
minimax is essentially",00:02:19.010,00:02:22.320
a depth first search.,00:02:22.320,00:02:24.550
"And at each level, it
chooses between all",00:02:24.550,00:02:28.080
"of the children whichever
value that the parent wants.",00:02:28.080,00:02:32.510
"So here after it would choose
the maximum of K and L,",00:02:32.510,00:02:35.480
for instance.,00:02:35.480,00:02:36.330
"But that's getting
ahead of ourselves.",00:02:36.330,00:02:37.570
"Because it's a
depth first search.",00:02:37.570,00:02:38.986
So we best start at the top.,00:02:38.986,00:02:40.874
"I'll help you guys
up for a while.",00:02:40.874,00:02:42.290
"So we're doing A. We
need the maximum of B, C,",00:02:42.290,00:02:44.480
"D, depth first search.",00:02:44.480,00:02:45.770
"We go to B. We're looking
for the minimum of E and F.",00:02:45.770,00:02:49.760
"So having looked at E, our
current minimum of E and F",00:02:49.760,00:02:55.980
is just 2 for the moment.,00:02:55.980,00:02:58.780
"So this is going to be
less than or equal to 2.",00:02:58.780,00:03:04.040
"All right, then we go down
to F, which is a maximizer.",00:03:04.040,00:03:06.690
"And its children are
K and L. So now I'm",00:03:06.690,00:03:09.850
"going to start making
you guys do stuff.",00:03:09.850,00:03:11.650
So what do you think?,00:03:11.650,00:03:13.960
"What is going to be
the minimax value at F?",00:03:13.960,00:03:17.620
"The minimax value at
F, what will that be?",00:03:17.620,00:03:20.659
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:03:20.659,00:03:21.534
"PROFESSOR: So that level is
a maximizer-- max, min, max.",00:03:25.150,00:03:29.090
F is a maximizer.,00:03:29.090,00:03:30.280
"K and L themselves
are minimizers.",00:03:30.280,00:03:32.420
"But they're pretty
impotent minimizers.",00:03:32.420,00:03:34.200
"Because they don't
get to choose.",00:03:34.200,00:03:35.590
"They just have to do K or L.
So the minimax value is three.",00:03:35.590,00:03:39.950
"And yeah, the path it
would like to go is K.",00:03:39.950,00:03:42.660
"So we'll say that the
minimax value here is 3.",00:03:42.660,00:03:45.510
It's in fact exactly equal to 3.,00:03:45.510,00:03:48.680
"So if this is 3 and this
is 2, then everyone,",00:03:48.680,00:03:53.410
we know that the value of B is?,00:03:53.410,00:03:55.476
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:03:55.476,00:03:57.710
PROFESSOR: I hear 3 and 2.,00:03:57.710,00:03:58.960
Which one is it?,00:03:58.960,00:04:00.281
AUDIENCE: 2.,00:04:00.281,00:04:00.780
"PROFESSOR: 2, that's right.",00:04:00.780,00:04:03.150
So the value here is 2.,00:04:03.150,00:04:04.600
"Great, let's go down
into this branch.",00:04:04.600,00:04:06.790
"So C is going to be
the minimum of G and 6.",00:04:06.790,00:04:09.427
But we don't see that yet.,00:04:09.427,00:04:10.510
"Because we're doing
a depth first search.",00:04:10.510,00:04:12.218
"It's going to be
the minimum of G.",00:04:12.218,00:04:13.840
"Now we need the
maximum of M and N.",00:04:13.840,00:04:16.540
We're going to need the minimum.,00:04:16.540,00:04:18.160
"M is the minimum of Q and
R. So let's switch sides.",00:04:18.160,00:04:23.530
The minimum of Q and R is?,00:04:23.530,00:04:27.100
AUDIENCE: 1.,00:04:27.100,00:04:28.305
PROFESSOR: Let's see.,00:04:28.305,00:04:29.180
"That's right, it's 1.",00:04:29.180,00:04:30.570
So M has a value of 1.,00:04:30.570,00:04:32.170
But I'm going to stay over here.,00:04:32.170,00:04:34.240
Because M has a value of 1.,00:04:34.240,00:04:36.140
"Knowing that, then we know
that G has a value of?",00:04:36.140,00:04:39.100
AUDIENCE: 7,00:04:39.100,00:04:39.600
PROFESSOR: That's right.,00:04:39.600,00:04:40.600
7 is higher than 1.,00:04:40.600,00:04:41.930
"And since G is a 7, we
now know going up to C",00:04:41.930,00:04:45.550
that C has a value of?,00:04:45.550,00:04:47.850
AUDIENCE: 6.,00:04:47.850,00:04:48.850
"PROFESSOR: Yes, C
has a value of 6.",00:04:48.850,00:04:50.830
That's the minimum 6 and 7.,00:04:50.830,00:04:52.710
"So now I'm going
to go back down.",00:04:52.710,00:04:54.600
"Because we've done one
of the other sub-trees.",00:04:54.600,00:04:57.370
This is a 6.,00:04:57.370,00:04:58.751
"All right, great.",00:04:58.751,00:04:59.950
"Now we're going to go down to D.
Hopefully it won't be too bad.",00:04:59.950,00:05:03.900
"These things usually
aren't terrible.",00:05:03.900,00:05:05.760
"Because they're made to be
pruned a lot in alpha-beta.",00:05:05.760,00:05:08.710
"So let's see, in D, we go down
to I. And that's just a 1.",00:05:08.710,00:05:12.350
"We go down to J. And let's see,
what's the minimax value of J?",00:05:12.350,00:05:17.040
AUDIENCE: It's 20.,00:05:17.040,00:05:17.860
PROFESSOR: That's right.,00:05:17.860,00:05:18.860
20 is the maximum of 20 and 2.,00:05:18.860,00:05:21.120
"Great, so what's the
minimax value of D?",00:05:21.120,00:05:24.780
Everyone said it-- 1.,00:05:24.780,00:05:25.990
"All right, so what's
the minimax value at A?",00:05:25.990,00:05:27.946
AUDIENCE: 6.,00:05:27.946,00:05:29.574
PROFESSOR: 6 is right.,00:05:29.574,00:05:30.490
6 is higher than 2.,00:05:30.490,00:05:31.660
It's higher than 1.,00:05:31.660,00:05:32.740
Our value is 6.,00:05:32.740,00:05:34.020
"And our path is-- everyone--
A, C, H. That's it.",00:05:34.020,00:05:41.960
"Great, is everyone
good with minimax?",00:05:41.960,00:05:46.329
"I know that usually
a lot of people are.",00:05:46.329,00:05:47.995
"There's usually a few
people who aren't.",00:05:47.995,00:05:49.510
"So if you're one
of the people who",00:05:49.510,00:05:50.950
"would like some clarifications
on minimax, raise your hand.",00:05:50.950,00:05:54.150
"There's probably a few other
people who would like some too.",00:05:54.150,00:05:58.680
OK.,00:05:58.680,00:06:00.536
"AUDIENCE: When you're doing
this minimax, whatever values",00:06:00.536,00:06:03.350
"are not showing, you
keep going down the tree",00:06:03.350,00:06:06.752
"and then just look
at whether you're",00:06:06.752,00:06:08.452
trying to find the minimax.,00:06:08.452,00:06:09.670
"And just whatever values
you get you go back up one?",00:06:09.670,00:06:12.380
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:06:12.380,00:06:14.710
"The question was, when you go
to do the minimax-- and let's",00:06:14.710,00:06:20.340
"say you got E was
2, and you know",00:06:20.340,00:06:21.724
"that B is going to be
less than or equal to 2,",00:06:21.724,00:06:23.640
but you don't know F yet.,00:06:23.640,00:06:25.160
"The question is, do you go down
the tree, find the value at F,",00:06:25.160,00:06:28.350
and then go back up?,00:06:28.350,00:06:29.460
The answer is yes.,00:06:29.460,00:06:31.270
"By default, we use a
depth first search.",00:06:31.270,00:06:33.300
"However, in non alpha-beta
version, just regular minimax,",00:06:33.300,00:06:36.550
"it turns out it probably
doesn't matter what you do.",00:06:36.550,00:06:40.900
"I suggested doing a depth
first search to get yourself",00:06:40.900,00:06:43.150
in the mindset of alpha-beta.,00:06:43.150,00:06:44.630
"Because order is very, very
important in alpha-beta.",00:06:44.630,00:06:49.290
"But here, I don't know, you
could do some weird bottom",00:06:49.290,00:06:52.150
up search.,00:06:52.150,00:06:53.110
"Whatever you want, it's going
to give you the right answer",00:06:53.110,00:06:56.010
"unless it asks what
order they evaluated.",00:06:56.010,00:06:58.380
But here's a hint.,00:06:58.380,00:06:59.280
"The order they're evaluated in
is depth first search order.",00:06:59.280,00:07:03.790
"So without even doing anything,
E, K, L, Q, R, N, H, I, O, P",00:07:03.790,00:07:09.620
"are the order of starting
evaluation in this tree.",00:07:09.620,00:07:13.355
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:07:13.355,00:07:14.230
"PROFESSOR: So the question
is, nodes like M and G",00:07:20.330,00:07:23.950
"we don't have to
put values next to.",00:07:23.950,00:07:26.130
"Technically, if we were
doing this very formally,",00:07:26.130,00:07:28.420
"and we couldn't
remember, and I wasn't",00:07:28.420,00:07:30.560
"up there among the people,
we would put 1 there.",00:07:30.560,00:07:33.780
"So at M, we would put a 1.",00:07:33.780,00:07:36.580
But people remembered that.,00:07:36.580,00:07:37.829
So we didn't do it.,00:07:37.829,00:07:38.620
"But then at G, we would put a 7.",00:07:38.620,00:07:40.599
"So if we were writing
it out very formally,",00:07:40.599,00:07:42.390
we would have a 1 and a 7.,00:07:42.390,00:07:45.280
"And at this D, we
would have a 1.",00:07:45.280,00:07:47.920
"And then at the A,
we would put a 6.",00:07:47.920,00:07:50.650
And then that's the answer.,00:07:50.650,00:07:53.140
"Also, we've even put things
like less than or greater",00:07:53.140,00:07:55.510
than part way along the way.,00:07:55.510,00:07:57.070
"However, I believe that
our alpha-beta search",00:07:57.070,00:08:00.590
"is going to definitely
fulfill everyone's quota",00:08:00.590,00:08:03.960
"of pedantically putting lots
of numbers next to nodes",00:08:03.960,00:08:07.030
on a game tree.,00:08:07.030,00:08:08.650
"And so once you've
done alpha-beta,",00:08:08.650,00:08:11.470
"if you can do it
correctly, you'll",00:08:11.470,00:08:13.870
"think, oh, minimax, oh,
those were the days.",00:08:13.870,00:08:16.260
It's going to be easy.,00:08:16.260,00:08:17.590
"Because alpha-beta is a
little bit more complicated.",00:08:17.590,00:08:22.170
"There's a lot of things
that trip people up here.",00:08:22.170,00:08:24.490
"For alpha-beta,
however, I will erase",00:08:24.490,00:08:26.270
"some of these numbers
for the moment.",00:08:26.270,00:08:28.750
They're still right.,00:08:28.750,00:08:30.660
"But we do it a
little differently.",00:08:30.660,00:08:33.700
"So what do alpha-beta and
beta add to this formula?",00:08:33.700,00:08:38.470
"Well, this is all sort
of a winning formula,",00:08:38.470,00:08:40.710
except for it's not.,00:08:40.710,00:08:41.679
Because it takes too long.,00:08:41.679,00:08:43.490
But it's a very nice formula.,00:08:43.490,00:08:45.620
"U is the maximizer, say.",00:08:45.620,00:08:47.600
"I would try to think, if I do
this, what's he going to do?",00:08:47.600,00:08:50.410
"And then if he does that,
what am I going to do?",00:08:50.410,00:08:52.430
"And then what is
he going to do if I",00:08:52.430,00:08:54.340
"do that, et cetera, et cetera,
all the way to the bottom.",00:08:54.340,00:08:57.040
"With alpha and
beta, we add in what",00:08:57.040,00:08:58.560
I like to call nuclear options.,00:08:58.560,00:09:02.644
"I'd like in this game
of maximizer minimizer--",00:09:02.644,00:09:04.560
"you can think of it as like the
Cold War or the Peloponnesian",00:09:04.560,00:09:07.389
"War, except the Peloponnesian
War didn't have nukes, so",00:09:07.389,00:09:09.680
probably the Cold War.,00:09:09.680,00:09:12.710
"And in the Cold War,
or any situation",00:09:12.710,00:09:17.200
"where you're up against an
adversary who-- actually,",00:09:17.200,00:09:19.477
"this doesn't really work
as well for the Cold War.",00:09:19.477,00:09:21.560
"But in any situation
where you're",00:09:21.560,00:09:22.935
"up against an adversary
whose only goal in life",00:09:22.935,00:09:24.920
"is to destroy you,
you always want",00:09:24.920,00:09:27.260
"to find out what the best
thing you can possibly do",00:09:27.260,00:09:29.480
"is if they hit that button
and send nukes in from Cuba,",00:09:29.480,00:09:32.850
"or if they send fighter pilots,
or whatever is going on.",00:09:32.850,00:09:36.270
"So the idea of alpha
and beta is that they",00:09:36.270,00:09:38.600
"are numbers that represent
the fail-safe, the worst case.",00:09:38.600,00:09:45.030
"Because obviously
in the Cold War,",00:09:45.030,00:09:47.590
"sending nukes was
not a good plan.",00:09:47.590,00:09:50.820
"But presumably, us
sending nukes would",00:09:50.820,00:09:55.230
"be better than just being
attacked and killed.",00:09:55.230,00:09:57.880
"So the alpha and beta represent
the worst possible outcome",00:09:57.880,00:10:04.150
"you'd be willing to
accept for your side.",00:10:04.150,00:10:07.470
"Because right now,
you know you're",00:10:07.470,00:10:10.080
"guaranteed to be able to force
the conflict to that point",00:10:10.080,00:10:15.400
or better.,00:10:15.400,00:10:16.840
"So the alpha is the nuclear
option, the fail-safe,",00:10:16.840,00:10:19.780
of the maximizer.,00:10:19.780,00:10:22.420
"Nuclear options-- alpha is
maximizer's nuclear option.",00:10:22.420,00:10:27.890
"And beta is the
minimizer's nuclear option.",00:10:34.980,00:10:40.430
"So we ask ourselves-- and
people who were paying attention",00:10:46.994,00:10:49.410
"at lecture or wrote stuff
down know the answer already--",00:10:49.410,00:10:52.240
"what could we possibly
set to start off?",00:10:52.240,00:10:55.240
"Before we explore the
tree and find anything,",00:10:55.240,00:10:57.230
"what will we set as
our nuclear option,",00:10:57.230,00:10:59.760
as our sort of fail-safe?,00:10:59.760,00:11:01.280
"We could always fall
back on this number.",00:11:01.280,00:11:04.490
So you could set 0.,00:11:04.490,00:11:06.630
"You could try to set some
low number for the maximizer.",00:11:06.630,00:11:10.580
"Because if you set a high
number for the maximizer",00:11:10.580,00:11:12.960
"as its fail-safe, it's going to
be really snooty and just say,",00:11:12.960,00:11:16.150
"oh, I won't take this path.",00:11:16.150,00:11:17.310
"I already have a
fail-safe that's",00:11:17.310,00:11:18.770
better than all these paths.,00:11:18.770,00:11:19.970
"If you set, like,
100, you have no tree.",00:11:19.970,00:11:23.460
"Our default usually, in 6034,
is to set negative infinity",00:11:23.460,00:11:26.990
"for alpha or negative some very
large number if you're doing it",00:11:26.990,00:11:30.340
in your lab.,00:11:30.340,00:11:32.770
"So if we set negative infinity
as a default for alpha,",00:11:32.770,00:11:37.670
"that negative infinity is
basically maximizer loses.",00:11:37.670,00:11:41.600
"So the maximizer
goes in thinking,",00:11:41.600,00:11:43.020
"oh my god, if I don't
look at this game tree,",00:11:43.020,00:11:44.894
I automatically lose.,00:11:44.894,00:11:46.260
"He's willing to take the
first path possibly presented.",00:11:46.260,00:11:51.070
"And that's why that
negative infinity",00:11:51.070,00:11:52.764
is a good default for alpha.,00:11:52.764,00:11:53.930
"Anyone have a good idea
what a good default for beta",00:11:53.930,00:11:56.096
"is, or just remember?",00:11:56.096,00:11:57.710
"Positive infinity, that's right.",00:11:57.710,00:11:59.090
"Because the minimizer comes
in, and she's like, oh crap,",00:11:59.090,00:12:01.423
"the maximizer automatically wins
if I don't look at this node",00:12:01.423,00:12:05.660
here.,00:12:05.660,00:12:06.320
"That makes sure the
maximizer and the minimizer",00:12:06.320,00:12:08.278
"both are willing to look at the
first path they see every time.",00:12:08.278,00:12:12.240
Because look on this tree.,00:12:12.240,00:12:13.635
"If 10 was alpha, the
maximizer would just",00:12:13.635,00:12:16.560
"reject out of hand
everything except for P.",00:12:16.560,00:12:19.020
"And then we wouldn't
have a tree.",00:12:19.020,00:12:20.440
"The maximizer would lose,
because he would be like, hmm,",00:12:20.440,00:12:24.750
"this test game is
very interesting.",00:12:24.750,00:12:26.790
"However, I have
another option-- pft,",00:12:26.790,00:12:29.120
"and then you throw
over the table.",00:12:29.120,00:12:31.380
"That's 10 for me, because you
have to pick up the pieces.",00:12:31.380,00:12:33.976
I don't own this set.,00:12:33.976,00:12:34.850
I don't know.,00:12:34.850,00:12:36.990
"So that is why we set negative
infinity and positive infinity",00:12:36.990,00:12:40.440
"as the default for
alpha and beta.",00:12:40.440,00:12:42.770
"So how do alpha
and beta propagate?",00:12:42.770,00:12:44.240
And what do they do?,00:12:44.240,00:12:45.870
"The main purpose of alpha
and beta is that, as we said,",00:12:45.870,00:12:49.110
"alpha-- let's say we have
some chart of values.",00:12:49.110,00:12:52.130
"Alpha, which starts
at negative infinity,",00:12:52.130,00:12:55.700
"is the worst that the
maximizer is willing to accept.",00:12:55.700,00:12:58.935
"Because they know they can
get that much or better.",00:12:58.935,00:13:01.060
"It starts out, that's the
worst thing you can have.",00:13:01.060,00:13:03.800
So it's not a problem.,00:13:03.800,00:13:05.470
"Infinity is the highest that the
minimizer is willing to accept.",00:13:05.470,00:13:09.890
That's beta.,00:13:09.890,00:13:11.430
"As you go along,
though, the minimizer",00:13:11.430,00:13:13.250
"sees, oh, look at that.",00:13:13.250,00:13:14.970
"I can guarantee that at
best the maximizer gets 100.",00:13:14.970,00:13:18.610
"Haha, beta is now 100.",00:13:18.610,00:13:20.700
"The maximizer says, oh yeah?",00:13:20.700,00:13:22.790
"Well I can guarantee that the
lowest you can get me to go to",00:13:22.790,00:13:27.490
is 0.,00:13:27.490,00:13:28.280
So it's going to be 0.,00:13:28.280,00:13:31.330
"And this keeps going on
until maybe at 6-- note,",00:13:31.330,00:13:36.990
not drawn to scale.,00:13:36.990,00:13:38.670
"Maybe at 6, the
maximizer said, haha,",00:13:38.670,00:13:41.940
"you can't make me
go lower than 6.",00:13:41.940,00:13:44.030
"And the minimizer says, aha, you
can't make me go higher than 6.",00:13:44.030,00:13:47.650
And then 6 is the answer.,00:13:47.650,00:13:50.120
"If you ever get to a point where
beta gets lower than alpha,",00:13:50.120,00:13:56.950
"or alpha gets lower than beta,
then you just say, screw this.",00:13:56.950,00:14:02.000
"I'm not even going to look
at the remaining stuff.",00:14:02.000,00:14:05.570
"I'm going to just prune now
and go somewhere else that's",00:14:05.570,00:14:09.870
less pointless than this.,00:14:09.870,00:14:11.780
"Because if the alpha gets higher
than the beta, what that's",00:14:11.780,00:14:15.220
"saying is the maximizer says,
oh man, look at this, minimizer.",00:14:15.220,00:14:18.515
"The lowest you can
make me go is, say, 50.",00:14:18.515,00:14:22.450
"And the minimizer
says, that's strange.",00:14:22.450,00:14:24.300
"Because the highest that
you can make me go is 40.",00:14:24.300,00:14:28.760
"So something's
generally amiss there.",00:14:28.760,00:14:32.210
"It usually means that
one of the two of them",00:14:32.210,00:14:35.220
"doesn't even want to be
exploring that branch at all.",00:14:35.220,00:14:37.890
So you prune at that point.,00:14:37.890,00:14:40.816
"All right, so given that
that's what we're looking for,",00:14:40.816,00:14:43.470
"how do we move the alphas and
betas throughout the tree?",00:14:43.470,00:14:46.650
"There's a few different
ways to draw them.",00:14:46.650,00:14:48.400
"And some of them I
consider to be very busy.",00:14:48.400,00:14:52.830
"Probably in recitation
and tutorial",00:14:52.830,00:14:54.930
"you will see a way that's
busier and has more numbers.",00:14:54.930,00:14:57.980
"Technically, every node has
both an alpha and a beta.",00:14:57.980,00:15:01.060
"However, the one that that
node is paying attention to",00:15:01.060,00:15:04.560
"is the alpha, if
it's a maximizer,",00:15:04.560,00:15:06.190
"and the beta if
it's a minimizer.",00:15:06.190,00:15:08.360
"So I generally, for my purposes,
only draw the alpha out",00:15:08.360,00:15:12.290
"for the maximizer and only draw
the beta out for the minimizer.",00:15:12.290,00:15:16.330
"Very rarely, but it happens,
they'll sometimes ask you,",00:15:16.330,00:15:19.742
"well, what's the beta
of this node, which",00:15:19.742,00:15:21.450
is a maximizer node?,00:15:21.450,00:15:22.460
"So it's good to know
how it's derived.",00:15:22.460,00:15:24.680
"But I think that it wastes
your time to write it out.",00:15:24.680,00:15:27.540
That's my opinion.,00:15:27.540,00:15:28.520
We'll see how it goes.,00:15:28.520,00:15:29.820
"So the way that it works, the
way that alpha and beta works,",00:15:29.820,00:15:32.720
is the Snow White principal.,00:15:32.720,00:15:33.970
"So does everyone know
the story of Snow White?",00:15:33.970,00:15:37.100
So there's a beautiful princess.,00:15:37.100,00:15:38.860
"There's an evil
queen stepmother.",00:15:38.860,00:15:40.696
"Mirror mirror on the wall,
who's the fairest of them all,",00:15:40.696,00:15:43.070
"finds out that it's
the stepdaughter.",00:15:43.070,00:15:46.620
"So much like in the real
world, in Snow White,",00:15:46.620,00:15:49.130
"the stepdaughter, Snow White,
had the beauty of her parents.",00:15:49.130,00:15:52.440
She inherited those.,00:15:52.440,00:15:54.070
"However, much like in
the real world, maybe",00:15:54.070,00:15:56.560
"or perhaps not, the stepmother
had an even better plan.",00:15:56.560,00:16:00.810
"She hired a hunter to
sort of hunt Snow White,",00:16:00.810,00:16:04.980
"pull out Snow White's
heart, and feed it",00:16:04.980,00:16:07.560
"to her so that she
could gain Snow White's",00:16:07.560,00:16:09.710
beauty for herself.,00:16:09.710,00:16:11.590
"How many people knew that
version of the story?",00:16:11.590,00:16:14.900
A few people.,00:16:14.900,00:16:15.590
"That's the original
version of the story.",00:16:15.590,00:16:17.298
Disney didn't put that in.,00:16:17.298,00:16:18.570
"The hunter then
brought the heart",00:16:18.570,00:16:19.944
"of a deer, which I think in
Disney the hunter did kill",00:16:19.944,00:16:22.250
"a deer arbitrarily,
but it was not",00:16:22.250,00:16:24.130
"explained that that's
why he was doing it.",00:16:24.130,00:16:26.260
"So in alpha-beta,
it's just like that.",00:16:26.260,00:16:29.540
"By which I mean you start
by inheriting the alpha",00:16:29.540,00:16:32.760
and beta of your parents.,00:16:32.760,00:16:34.400
"But if you see something that
you like amongst your children,",00:16:34.400,00:16:38.360
"you take it for yourself--
the Snow White principle.",00:16:38.360,00:16:42.810
So let's see how that goes.,00:16:42.810,00:16:44.100
"Well, I told you guys that
the default alpha was--",00:16:44.100,00:16:48.200
AUDIENCE: Negative infinity.,00:16:48.200,00:16:49.612
PROFESSOR: Negative infinity.,00:16:49.612,00:16:50.820
"So here alpha is
negative infinity.",00:16:50.820,00:16:54.300
"And I told you that the default
beta was positive infinity.",00:16:54.300,00:16:58.310
"We're doing a depth
first search here.",00:16:58.310,00:17:01.110
"All right, beta is infinity.",00:17:01.110,00:17:03.590
"All right, so we come here to
E. Now, we could put an alpha.",00:17:03.590,00:17:09.099
"But I never put
an alpha or a beta",00:17:09.099,00:17:12.140
for one of the terminal nodes.,00:17:12.140,00:17:14.250
"Because it can't
really do anything.",00:17:14.250,00:17:17.329
It's just 2.,00:17:17.329,00:17:19.060
"So as we go down, we
take the alpha and beta",00:17:19.060,00:17:22.352
from our parents.,00:17:22.352,00:17:23.060
"But as we go up to a
parent, if the parent likes",00:17:23.060,00:17:25.830
"what it sees in the child,
it takes it instead.",00:17:25.830,00:17:28.450
"So I ask you all the
question, would the minimizer",00:17:28.450,00:17:31.440
"prefer this 2 that it sees from
its child or its own infinity",00:17:31.440,00:17:35.490
for a beta?,00:17:35.490,00:17:36.630
AUDIENCE: 2,00:17:36.630,00:17:37.390
PROFESSOR: It likes the 2.,00:17:37.390,00:17:38.790
That's absolutely right.,00:17:38.790,00:17:40.190
So 2.,00:17:40.190,00:17:44.060
"All right, great, so now we go
down to F. What is F's alpha?",00:17:44.060,00:17:48.575
Who says negative infinity?,00:17:51.854,00:17:55.938
Who says 2?,00:17:55.938,00:17:58.220
"No one-- oh, you guys are good.",00:17:58.220,00:18:01.690
It's negative infinity.,00:18:01.690,00:18:03.220
"Technically, it also
will have a beta of 2.",00:18:03.220,00:18:06.094
But we're ignoring the beta.,00:18:06.094,00:18:07.260
"And the alphas that have
been progressing downward",00:18:07.260,00:18:09.890
"from the parents--
negative infinity.",00:18:09.890,00:18:11.962
"That's why I called it the
grandfather clause before.",00:18:11.962,00:18:14.170
"Because you would often look up
to your grandparent to see what",00:18:14.170,00:18:19.280
your default number is.,00:18:19.280,00:18:21.800
"So we get an alpha
of negative infinity.",00:18:21.800,00:18:23.830
"We then go down to the K.
It's a static evaluation.",00:18:23.830,00:18:26.134
"And now I'm going to start
calling on people individually.",00:18:26.134,00:18:28.550
"So hopefully people
paid attention",00:18:28.550,00:18:30.450
"to the mob, who
were always correct.",00:18:30.450,00:18:34.010
"All right, so we go down
to K. And we see a 3.",00:18:34.010,00:18:38.520
F is a maximizer node.,00:18:38.520,00:18:40.520
So what does F do now?,00:18:40.520,00:18:43.300
"AUDIENCE: Switches
its alpha to 3.",00:18:43.300,00:18:45.450
"PROFESSOR: Yes, switches
its alpha to 3, great.",00:18:45.450,00:18:48.350
"All right, so that's
already quite good.",00:18:55.430,00:18:59.005
It switches alpha to 3.,00:18:59.005,00:19:00.075
It's very happy.,00:19:00.075,00:19:01.330
It's got a 3 here.,00:19:01.330,00:19:03.526
That's a nice value.,00:19:03.526,00:19:06.360
"So what does it do
at L, the next node?",00:19:06.360,00:19:16.736
"It's gone to K, went
back up to F. Depth",00:19:16.736,00:19:18.865
"first search, the next
one would be L, right?",00:19:18.865,00:19:20.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:19:23.274,00:19:24.149
"PROFESSOR: Well, technically
F could take L's value of 0",00:19:27.376,00:19:32.420
if it liked it better than 3.,00:19:32.420,00:19:34.690
But it's a maximizer.,00:19:34.690,00:19:35.590
So does it want to take that?,00:19:35.590,00:19:37.535
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:19:37.535,00:19:38.410
"PROFESSOR: OK, that
technically would be correct.",00:19:38.410,00:19:40.310
But I'm sorry.,00:19:40.310,00:19:40.893
"I burdened you with
a trick question.",00:19:40.893,00:19:43.830
"In fact, we don't
look at L at all.",00:19:43.830,00:19:47.180
Does everyone see that?,00:19:51.780,00:19:53.510
I'll explain.,00:19:53.510,00:19:54.740
The alpha at F has reached 3.,00:19:54.740,00:19:57.190
But the beta at B is 2.,00:19:57.190,00:20:00.700
"So B looks down and
says, wait a minute.",00:20:00.700,00:20:03.600
"If I go down to F, my
enemy's nuclear option,",00:20:03.600,00:20:06.990
"my enemy is the worst it
can be for-- the best it",00:20:06.990,00:20:10.450
can be for me is 3.,00:20:10.450,00:20:11.960
F is trumpeting it around.,00:20:11.960,00:20:14.320
"I was thinking of eating
his heart, or whatever,",00:20:14.320,00:20:16.436
but I didn't want to.,00:20:16.436,00:20:17.310
But it's going to be 3.,00:20:17.310,00:20:19.050
"It's going to be 3 or
higher down there at F.",00:20:19.050,00:20:24.146
There's no way I want that.,00:20:24.146,00:20:25.270
"I already have my own
default escape plan.",00:20:25.270,00:20:29.310
And that's 2.,00:20:29.310,00:20:30.219
"That's going to be better
than whatever comes out",00:20:30.219,00:20:32.260
of that horrible F. So screw it.,00:20:32.260,00:20:35.871
"And we never look at L.
Does everyone get that?",00:20:35.871,00:20:39.535
"That is the main principle
of alpha-beta pruning.",00:20:39.535,00:20:43.520
"If you see an alpha that's
higher than the beta above it--",00:20:43.520,00:20:47.100
"as I said, if alpha
goes up above the beta--",00:20:47.100,00:20:50.020
"or if you see a beta, like
if there's a beta down here,",00:20:50.020,00:20:55.360
"and it's lower than the
alpha above it, prune it.",00:20:55.360,00:20:59.450
Stop doing that.,00:20:59.450,00:21:02.450
"And the question is, who prunes?",00:21:02.450,00:21:04.270
"Who decides that
you don't look at L?",00:21:04.270,00:21:06.840
"The person who is
thinking not to look at L",00:21:06.840,00:21:09.560
"is always up higher by
at least two levels.",00:21:09.560,00:21:13.460
"So up here, B is
saying, hmm, I don't",00:21:13.460,00:21:15.670
"want to look at L. Because F
is already so terrible for me",00:21:15.670,00:21:19.130
that it's just beyond belief.,00:21:19.130,00:21:22.890
"If this is 100, it might be 100.",00:21:22.890,00:21:25.920
"Even if it's lower, I'm
still going to get a three.",00:21:25.920,00:21:29.350
"There's a sanity check that
I've written that I sort of came",00:21:29.350,00:21:33.330
"up with just in case you're
not sure that you can skip it.",00:21:33.330,00:21:36.180
"Because on a lot of
these tests, we ask you,",00:21:36.180,00:21:38.060
"which one's do you evaluate,
which ones do you skip, right?",00:21:38.060,00:21:40.884
"Or we just say, which
ones do you evaluate,",00:21:40.884,00:21:42.675
"and you don't write
the ones that you skip.",00:21:42.675,00:21:44.760
"Here's my sanity test to
see if you can skip it.",00:21:44.760,00:21:48.860
"Ask yourself, if
that node that I'm",00:21:48.860,00:21:52.080
"about to skip contained
a negative infinity",00:21:52.080,00:21:54.040
"or some arbitrarily small
number, negative infinity",00:21:54.040,00:21:56.550
"being the minimizer wins,
would it change anything?",00:21:56.550,00:22:01.260
"Now that I've
answered that, if it",00:22:01.260,00:22:02.920
"contained a positive infinity,
would it change anything?",00:22:02.920,00:22:07.350
"If the answer is no
both times, then you're",00:22:07.350,00:22:11.820
"definitely correct
in pruning it.",00:22:11.820,00:22:13.760
So look at that 0.,00:22:13.760,00:22:14.850
"If it was a negative
infinity, minimizer wins,",00:22:14.850,00:22:16.810
what would happen?,00:22:16.810,00:22:17.705
"The maximizer would say, I'm
not touching that was a 10 foot",00:22:17.705,00:22:20.320
"pole, choosing 3.",00:22:20.320,00:22:22.370
"The minimizer would say,
screw that, I'll take E.",00:22:22.370,00:22:26.380
"Let's say it was a
positive infinity.",00:22:26.380,00:22:28.005
"The maximizer would say,
eureka, holy grain, I win.",00:22:28.005,00:22:31.075
"The minimizer would say,
yeah, if I'm a moron,",00:22:31.075,00:22:33.080
"and go down to F, and then
would go to E and take 2.",00:22:33.080,00:22:36.450
"So no matter what was there,
the minimizer would go to E.",00:22:36.450,00:22:41.640
"And you could say, well,
what if it was exactly 2?",00:22:41.640,00:22:44.100
"But still the
maximizer would choose",00:22:44.100,00:22:46.130
"K. The minimizer would
go to E. So there's",00:22:46.130,00:22:48.520
no reason to go down there.,00:22:48.520,00:22:49.680
"We can just prune
it off right now.",00:22:49.680,00:22:51.410
"Does everyone
agree, everyone see",00:22:51.410,00:22:54.070
what I'm talking about here?,00:22:54.070,00:22:55.720
"Great, so we're now
done with this branch.",00:22:55.720,00:23:00.225
Because beta is 2.,00:23:00.225,00:23:01.790
"So now we're up at
old grandpappy A.",00:23:01.790,00:23:05.232
"And he has an alpha
of negative infinity.",00:23:05.232,00:23:06.940
"Everyone, what will he do?",00:23:06.940,00:23:11.660
He'll take the 2.,00:23:11.660,00:23:12.709
"It's better than negative
infinity for him.",00:23:12.709,00:23:14.500
It's not wonderful.,00:23:14.500,00:23:15.600
"But certainly anything is
better than an automatic loss.",00:23:15.600,00:23:19.670
"All right, now our
highest node is a 2.",00:23:19.670,00:23:23.780
"So let's keep that in
mind for our alpha.",00:23:23.780,00:23:27.380
"OK, so let's go over here.",00:23:27.380,00:23:29.820
"Let's see, so what
will be the value at C?",00:23:29.820,00:23:32.854
What will be the beta value?,00:23:32.854,00:23:34.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:23:37.366,00:23:40.282
"PROFESSOR: You go
back to which one?",00:23:42.712,00:23:44.660
To G. I'm not at G yet.,00:23:44.660,00:23:47.090
"I'm actually just starting
the middle branch.",00:23:47.090,00:23:49.800
"So I'm going to C. And what's
going to be its starting",00:23:49.800,00:23:52.280
beta before I go down?,00:23:52.280,00:23:54.902
AUDIENCE: Infinity.,00:23:54.902,00:23:56.170
"PROFESSOR: Infinity, that's
right-- default value.",00:23:56.170,00:23:58.910
It's easier than it seemed.,00:23:58.910,00:24:00.570
"All right, so yes, beta
is equal to infinity.",00:24:00.570,00:24:03.690
This should be better erased.,00:24:06.370,00:24:08.090
I think it's confusing people.,00:24:08.090,00:24:09.570
"Great, OK, so beta is
equal to infinity at C.",00:24:09.570,00:24:14.790
"Now we go down depth
first search to G. What's",00:24:14.790,00:24:17.110
going to be our alpha at G?,00:24:17.110,00:24:18.460
AUDIENCE: Minus infinity.,00:24:18.460,00:24:19.620
"PROFESSOR: Ahh,
it would seem so.",00:24:19.620,00:24:21.560
"However, take a look up
at the great-grandpappy A.",00:24:21.560,00:24:26.110
It seems to have changed to 2.,00:24:26.110,00:24:28.490
So this time it's 2.,00:24:28.490,00:24:29.930
"Why is it 2 instead
of negative infinity?",00:24:29.930,00:24:31.680
"Why can we let A be so noxious
and not start with saying,",00:24:31.680,00:24:34.873
"oh, I automatically lose?",00:24:34.873,00:24:36.710
"Well, A knows that no
matter how awful things get",00:24:36.710,00:24:40.040
"in that middle branch,
he can just say,",00:24:40.040,00:24:42.680
screw the whole middle branch.,00:24:42.680,00:24:43.930
I'm going to B.,00:24:43.930,00:24:45.110
"That's something that
the minimizer can't do.",00:24:45.110,00:24:47.796
"And we have to start at
infinity for the minimizer.",00:24:47.796,00:24:49.920
But the maximizer can.,00:24:49.920,00:24:51.140
"Because he has the
choice at the top.",00:24:51.140,00:24:52.790
Does everyone see that?,00:24:52.790,00:24:53.850
"He can just say, oh, I'm
not even going to C. Yeah,",00:24:53.850,00:24:56.440
shows you.,00:24:56.440,00:24:57.330
I'm going to A and taking the 2.,00:24:57.330,00:24:59.320
"So therefore alpha
is actually 2 at G.",00:24:59.320,00:25:03.640
"All right, great, so
we've got an alpha that's",00:25:03.640,00:25:06.500
"2 at G. We're going to go
down to M. It's a minimizer.",00:25:06.500,00:25:10.790
"All right, what's going
to be our beta value at M?",00:25:10.790,00:25:14.407
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:25:14.407,00:25:15.282
"PROFESSOR: Or which is
the beta default, minus",00:25:19.230,00:25:21.325
or positive infinity?,00:25:21.325,00:25:22.200
What would be the minimizer?,00:25:22.200,00:25:24.554
AUDIENCE: Positive.,00:25:24.554,00:25:25.345
"PROFESSOR: Positive
infinity, that's right.",00:25:25.345,00:25:27.180
"M is going to be a
positive infinity for beta.",00:25:27.180,00:25:29.250
"Again, it picks it
up from C. Great,",00:25:29.250,00:25:34.670
"now we get to some
actual values.",00:25:34.670,00:25:39.030
So we're at some actual values.,00:25:39.030,00:25:41.390
"We are at Q. So
what's going to happen",00:25:41.390,00:25:45.520
at M when M sees that Q is 1?,00:25:45.520,00:25:47.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:25:53.431,00:25:55.040
PROFESSOR: What is beta?,00:25:55.040,00:25:56.040
It says infinity.,00:25:56.040,00:25:56.371
"I'm sorry, it's hard to read.",00:25:56.371,00:25:57.890
Beta is infinity at M.,00:25:57.890,00:25:59.486
"AUDIENCE: OK, so it's
going to minimize, right?",00:25:59.486,00:26:01.470
"So it's going to be
like, OK, [INAUDIBLE].",00:26:01.470,00:26:05.001
PROFESSOR: That's right.,00:26:05.001,00:26:06.000
"So they're going
to put beta to 1.",00:26:06.000,00:26:08.270
"Because it sees Q. Great,
so my next question is,",00:26:08.270,00:26:16.250
what's going to happen at R?,00:26:16.250,00:26:19.124
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:26:19.124,00:26:22.052
PROFESSOR: Very smart.,00:26:28.030,00:26:30.010
You've detected my trap.,00:26:30.010,00:26:31.397
"The question is,
does it look at R?",00:26:31.397,00:26:32.855
"The answer is, no.",00:26:32.855,00:26:35.142
"It doesn't look at R.
Why doesn't it look at R?",00:26:35.142,00:26:37.100
Does everyone see?,00:26:37.100,00:26:39.020
"Yeah, alpha is now greater
than the beta below it.",00:26:39.020,00:26:42.330
"Beta has gotten
lower than alpha.",00:26:42.330,00:26:43.917
"This is the same thing I
was talking about before,",00:26:43.917,00:26:46.000
"when we figured out that
the alpha here is 2.",00:26:46.000,00:26:48.090
"The maximizer says,
wait a minute.",00:26:48.090,00:26:52.470
"The maximizer G says, if I go
to M, the best I'm getting out",00:26:52.470,00:26:55.740
of this is 1.,00:26:55.740,00:26:56.759
"Because if this is
negative infinity,",00:26:56.759,00:26:58.300
the minimizer will choose it.,00:26:58.300,00:26:59.680
"If this is positive
infinity, he'll choose 1.",00:26:59.680,00:27:01.555
"The best I'm going to
get out of here is 1.",00:27:01.555,00:27:04.237
"If that's the case, I might
as well have just gone",00:27:04.237,00:27:06.320
"to B and not even gone to C.
So I'm not going to go to M.",00:27:06.320,00:27:09.600
"I'll go to N, maybe.",00:27:09.600,00:27:10.440
Maybe N is better.,00:27:10.440,00:27:13.370
Does everyone see that?,00:27:13.370,00:27:15.300
"Great, so let's say that
the maximizer does go to N.",00:27:15.300,00:27:20.270
"So what's going to
happen with this alpha?",00:27:20.270,00:27:23.379
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:27:23.379,00:27:24.800
"PROFESSOR: That's right,
it's going to be 7.",00:27:24.800,00:27:26.640
7 is better than 2.,00:27:26.640,00:27:28.080
"And the maximizer has
control to get to that seven,",00:27:28.080,00:27:30.960
"at least if it gets to G. All
right, now the minimizer at C--",00:27:30.960,00:27:36.940
we'll do everyone this time.,00:27:36.940,00:27:38.580
"The minimizer at C, seeing that
7, what does the minimizer do?",00:27:38.580,00:27:43.798
Anyone?,00:27:43.798,00:27:44.298
So it sees the 7.,00:27:48.200,00:27:49.210
What does it do to its beta?,00:27:49.210,00:27:50.680
"It takes the 7-- better
than infinity, anyway.",00:27:50.680,00:27:55.330
"And yeah, then it checks H.
And everybody, again, what",00:27:55.330,00:27:58.290
happens at H?,00:27:58.290,00:28:00.100
It takes the 6.,00:28:00.100,00:28:00.970
It's lower than 7.,00:28:00.970,00:28:01.865
"All right, now we'll
go back to having",00:28:04.730,00:28:07.747
people do it on their own.,00:28:07.747,00:28:08.830
"Well, all the way
back to the top,",00:28:08.830,00:28:10.246
"what does A do when it
sees the 6 coming out of C?",00:28:10.246,00:28:13.216
AUDIENCE: Changes to 6.,00:28:13.216,00:28:15.150
"PROFESSOR: Changes
to 6, that's right.",00:28:15.150,00:28:17.330
Alpha equals 6.,00:28:17.330,00:28:18.910
"Great-- homestretch,
people, homestretch.",00:28:18.910,00:28:24.620
"So the minimizer, everyone,
has a beta of infinity.",00:28:24.620,00:28:31.650
"And if I wasn't a static node,
it would have an alpha of 6.",00:28:31.650,00:28:35.070
But it is a static node.,00:28:35.070,00:28:36.090
So it just has a value of 1.,00:28:36.090,00:28:38.570
"So since it has a value of 1,
everyone, the beta becomes 1.",00:28:38.570,00:28:43.380
"And what next, everyone?",00:28:43.380,00:28:45.264
AUDIENCE: Prune.,00:28:45.264,00:28:45.930
"PROFESSOR: Prune, that's right.",00:28:45.930,00:28:49.960
Why prune?,00:28:49.960,00:28:51.110
"Well, this time it's A
himself who can prune.",00:28:51.110,00:28:54.650
"A says, well darn,
if I go to D, I'm",00:28:54.650,00:28:56.723
"going to get 1 or something
even worse than 1.",00:28:56.723,00:28:59.360
"I might as well take
my 6 while I have it,",00:28:59.360,00:29:02.550
"prune all the rest
all the way down.",00:29:02.550,00:29:04.875
Everyone see that?,00:29:09.210,00:29:10.620
Everyone cool with that?,00:29:10.620,00:29:12.710
"It's not too bad if you
take it one step at a time.",00:29:12.710,00:29:16.060
We did it.,00:29:16.060,00:29:18.410
"Our question is, which nodes
are evaluated in order?",00:29:18.410,00:29:21.966
"Our answer is, everyone-- E, K,
Q, N, H, I. OK, not so obvious,",00:29:21.966,00:29:35.170
I guess.,00:29:35.170,00:29:35.670
A few people followed me.,00:29:35.670,00:29:36.980
"But it is E, K, Q, N, H, I.
It's just depth first order.",00:29:36.980,00:29:40.590
And we pruned some of them away.,00:29:40.590,00:29:43.220
"Great, so that is alpha-beta.",00:29:43.220,00:29:47.260
"Any questions about that
before I give some questions",00:29:47.260,00:29:49.470
about progressive deepening?,00:29:49.470,00:29:52.022
"All right, we've got a bunch.",00:29:52.022,00:29:53.230
So first question.,00:29:53.230,00:29:55.182
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
nodes like F, B, C, and D?",00:29:55.182,00:30:02.480
"PROFESSOR: The
question is, when asked",00:30:02.480,00:30:04.190
"for the order of evaluation,
are we excluding F, B, C, and D?",00:30:04.190,00:30:07.900
"The answer is we're talking
about here static evaluation.",00:30:07.900,00:30:11.250
"The static evaluator is a
very important and interesting",00:30:11.250,00:30:14.720
function.,00:30:14.720,00:30:15.400
"And I'll get back to something
a few students have asked me",00:30:15.400,00:30:18.230
"about the static evaluator later
and try to explain what it is.",00:30:18.230,00:30:21.484
"It's basically the thing
that pops out those numbers",00:30:21.484,00:30:23.650
at the bottom of the leaves.,00:30:23.650,00:30:25.015
"So when we ask, what
is the order of nodes",00:30:25.015,00:30:26.765
"that were statically
evaluated, we mean leaves only.",00:30:26.765,00:30:31.510
That's a good question.,00:30:31.510,00:30:32.580
Any other questions?,00:30:32.580,00:30:33.620
"Let's see, there was
one up here before.",00:30:33.620,00:30:35.430
But it's gone.,00:30:35.430,00:30:36.170
It might have been the same one.,00:30:36.170,00:30:37.885
Question?,00:30:37.885,00:30:38.384
AUDIENCE: So a similar question.,00:30:38.384,00:30:39.717
"When you say, static nodes,
that just means the leaf nodes?",00:30:39.717,00:30:42.578
"PROFESSOR: Means the
leaf nodes, that's right.",00:30:42.578,00:30:43.750
"The question is, does static
nodes mean the leaf nodes.",00:30:43.750,00:30:46.041
The answer is yes.,00:30:46.041,00:30:46.903
"AUDIENCE: And so
static evaluation",00:30:46.903,00:30:48.319
"is when you compare the value
of a static node to something?",00:30:48.319,00:30:51.737
"PROFESSOR: Static
evaluation is when you get",00:30:51.737,00:30:53.570
"that number, the static node.",00:30:53.570,00:30:55.180
Let me explain.,00:30:55.180,00:30:56.480
"Unless someone else has another
question about alpha-beta,",00:30:56.480,00:30:59.140
let me explain static values.,00:30:59.140,00:31:00.500
Because I was about to do that.,00:31:00.500,00:31:02.030
"There is a question
about alpha-beta.",00:31:02.030,00:31:03.571
"I'll come back to both of
yours after I answer this.",00:31:03.571,00:31:06.326
"AUDIENCE: You were
mentioning [INAUDIBLE].",00:31:06.326,00:31:09.437
And I'm a little bit confused.,00:31:09.437,00:31:11.385
"If you're looking at
one node, and you're",00:31:11.385,00:31:13.576
"seeing either grab the
value from the grandparent",00:31:13.576,00:31:16.255
or grab it from the--,00:31:16.255,00:31:18.203
"PROFESSOR: So it always
starts-- the question is, what",00:31:18.203,00:31:21.134
is the Snow White principle?,00:31:21.134,00:31:22.300
How does it work?,00:31:22.300,00:31:23.380
"Every node always
starts off with taking",00:31:23.380,00:31:26.760
"the value of the same
type, alpha or beta,",00:31:26.760,00:31:29.865
from its grandparent.,00:31:29.865,00:31:30.740
It always starts that way.,00:31:30.740,00:31:33.010
"Now, you say, why
the grandparent?",00:31:33.010,00:31:34.427
"Wouldn't it take
it from the parent?",00:31:34.427,00:31:35.926
It actually does.,00:31:35.926,00:31:37.050
"But I'm not drawing out the
alphas at all the minimizer",00:31:37.050,00:31:39.430
levels.,00:31:39.430,00:31:39.700
Because they don't do anything.,00:31:39.700,00:31:40.991
"They're only even there
to pass them down.",00:31:40.991,00:31:44.200
"So all of the values pass
down, down, down, down, down",00:31:44.200,00:31:48.110
to begin.,00:31:48.110,00:31:49.050
"Every node, in fact, starts
off with its grandparents",00:31:49.050,00:31:55.390
"with its parents' values, OK?",00:31:55.390,00:31:57.920
"But then when the
node sees a child,",00:31:57.920,00:32:00.730
it's completely done evaluating.,00:32:00.730,00:32:02.780
It's finished.,00:32:02.780,00:32:05.360
It can't be in the process.,00:32:05.360,00:32:08.380
"Let's say C. When C sees
that G is completely",00:32:08.380,00:32:13.550
"done with all of
its sub-branches",00:32:13.550,00:32:15.780
"and is ready to return
a value, or if it's just",00:32:15.780,00:32:18.760
"a static evaluation, then it's
automatically completely done.",00:32:18.760,00:32:22.120
Because it has no children.,00:32:22.120,00:32:25.020
"A static value like K of 3 is
automatically completely done.",00:32:25.020,00:32:29.550
It's got a 3.,00:32:29.550,00:32:30.830
"Similarly, when we came
back to G after going to N,",00:32:30.830,00:32:33.360
"and we knew that the value was
7, that was completely done.",00:32:33.360,00:32:36.140
The value was definitely 7.,00:32:36.140,00:32:37.730
"There was no other
possibilities.",00:32:37.730,00:32:39.480
"AUDIENCE: That's after looking
at the children, right?",00:32:39.480,00:32:40.830
PROFESSOR: Yes.,00:32:40.830,00:32:41.500
"So once you're done with
all the children of G,",00:32:41.500,00:32:44.630
"then G comes up and
says, guess what?",00:32:44.630,00:32:46.250
"Guess what, guys?",00:32:46.250,00:32:47.409
"So technically before
that, you would",00:32:47.409,00:32:48.950
"have said that G's alpha is
greater than or equal to 1",00:32:48.950,00:32:53.210
"when we looked at Q. And then
we looked at M. We'd say,",00:32:53.210,00:32:55.950
it's equal exactly to 7.,00:32:55.950,00:32:57.640
We're done here.,00:32:57.640,00:32:58.890
"And then at that point,
when it's fresh and ripe",00:32:58.890,00:33:02.170
"and has all of its highest
value or its best value,",00:33:02.170,00:33:04.890
"that's when the parent can eat
its heart and gain that value",00:33:04.890,00:33:08.100
itself.,00:33:08.100,00:33:08.980
"So that's when C says,
for instance, oh man,",00:33:08.980,00:33:12.340
I have an infinity.,00:33:12.340,00:33:14.550
I really like that 7 better.,00:33:14.550,00:33:16.060
And it takes the 7.,00:33:16.060,00:33:17.390
"But then it saw H. And it
said, oh man, that's a 6.",00:33:17.390,00:33:19.840
That's even better than 7.,00:33:19.840,00:33:20.980
So it took the 6.,00:33:20.980,00:33:21.765
"AUDIENCE: So shouldn't
the alpha take 7 then?",00:33:21.765,00:33:24.510
PROFESSOR: So alpha takes 6.,00:33:24.510,00:33:25.780
Because C is a minimizer.,00:33:25.780,00:33:27.300
"C took the 7 from
G, but then right",00:33:27.300,00:33:29.960
"after that C saw
H and took the 6.",00:33:29.960,00:33:32.810
Because 6 is even lower than 7.,00:33:32.810,00:33:35.880
And then alpha took the 6.,00:33:35.880,00:33:38.160
Because 6 was higher than 2.,00:33:38.160,00:33:40.260
"AUDIENCE: So it's not going
to look below the branch?",00:33:40.260,00:33:42.824
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, the problem
is that the maximizer doesn't",00:33:42.824,00:33:45.240
have control there.,00:33:45.240,00:33:46.490
"The minimizer has
got control at C.",00:33:46.490,00:33:48.464
"And the minimizer
is going to make",00:33:48.464,00:33:49.880
sure it's as low as possible.,00:33:49.880,00:33:52.020
"The maximizer at A, his only
control, or her only control,",00:33:52.020,00:33:56.470
"is the ability to send
either way to B or C",00:33:56.470,00:33:59.460
"or D. And then at
that point, at C,",00:33:59.460,00:34:02.346
"the minimizer gets to
choose if we go to G or H.",00:34:02.346,00:34:04.345
"And it's never going to choose
G. Because G is higher than H.",00:34:04.345,00:34:07.300
"All right, awesome, was
there another question?",00:34:07.300,00:34:09.829
"All right, let's go back
to static evaluations.",00:34:09.829,00:34:12.830
"When I first took this class,
I had some weird thoughts",00:34:12.830,00:34:16.139
about static evolutions.,00:34:16.139,00:34:17.139
"I heard some
students ask me this.",00:34:17.139,00:34:18.739
"I almost got a question about
it onto one of the tests,",00:34:18.739,00:34:21.475
"but it was edited to some
other weird question that",00:34:21.475,00:34:23.600
"was m to the b to the
d minus 1 or something",00:34:23.600,00:34:25.451
like that at the last minute.,00:34:25.451,00:34:26.659
"So I'm going to pose you
guys the actual question that",00:34:26.659,00:34:28.909
"would have been on one
of the older test, which",00:34:28.909,00:34:31.520
is the following.,00:34:31.520,00:34:32.790
"I had a student who came
to me and said, you know,",00:34:32.790,00:34:34.873
"[INAUDIBLE], when we do this
alpha-beta pruning, and all",00:34:34.873,00:34:37.489
"this other stuff, we're trying
to assume that we're really",00:34:37.489,00:34:40.560
"saving that much
time by getting rid",00:34:40.560,00:34:42.870
of a few static evaluations.,00:34:42.870,00:34:44.361
"In fact, when we do
progressive deepening,",00:34:44.361,00:34:46.110
"we're always just counting,
how many static evaluations",00:34:46.110,00:34:48.401
do we have to do?,00:34:48.401,00:34:49.290
"And he said, I look at
these static evaluations.",00:34:49.290,00:34:51.586
And there's just a 3 there.,00:34:51.586,00:34:52.710
"It takes no time to do
the static evaluation.",00:34:52.710,00:34:56.520
It's on the board.,00:34:56.520,00:34:57.890
"It takes much longer
to do the alpha-beta.",00:34:57.890,00:34:59.920
"It's faster by far
to not do alpha-beta.",00:34:59.920,00:35:02.770
"So I then tried to
explain to that student.",00:35:02.770,00:35:04.680
"I said, OK, we need
to be clear about what",00:35:04.680,00:35:07.050
static evaluations are.,00:35:07.050,00:35:08.340
You guys get it easy.,00:35:08.340,00:35:09.590
"We put these numbers
on the board.",00:35:09.590,00:35:11.657
"A static evaluation--
let's say you're",00:35:11.657,00:35:13.240
playing a game like chess.,00:35:13.240,00:35:17.010
"Static evaluation
takes a long time.",00:35:17.010,00:35:19.050
"When I was in 6170,
Java [INAUDIBLE],",00:35:19.050,00:35:21.910
"the class that used to
exist, we had a program",00:35:21.910,00:35:24.150
"called Anti-Chess where I used
my 6034 skills to write the AI.",00:35:24.150,00:35:28.440
"And the static evaluator
took a long time.",00:35:28.440,00:35:31.890
And we were timed.,00:35:31.890,00:35:32.970
"So getting the static
evaluator faster,",00:35:32.970,00:35:34.970
"that was the most
important thing.",00:35:34.970,00:35:36.602
Why does it take a long time?,00:35:36.602,00:35:37.810
"Well, the static
evaluator is an evaluation",00:35:37.810,00:35:39.875
"of the board position,
the state of the game,",00:35:39.875,00:35:43.730
at a snapshot of time.,00:35:43.730,00:35:45.519
"And that's not as easy as just
saying, oh, here's the answer.",00:35:45.519,00:35:48.060
"Because in chess,
first of all, not only",00:35:48.060,00:35:51.500
"did I have to look at
how many pieces I had,",00:35:51.500,00:35:53.780
what areas that I controlled.,00:35:53.780,00:35:56.520
"Also-- well, it was anti-chess.",00:35:56.520,00:35:58.154
But that's not withstanding.,00:35:58.154,00:35:59.320
"Let's pretend it's
regular chess.",00:35:59.320,00:36:01.110
"I also had to look, if
it was in regular chess--",00:36:01.110,00:36:03.900
"and I still had to do
this in anti-chess--",00:36:03.900,00:36:05.650
if my king was in check.,00:36:05.650,00:36:06.850
"And what that meant
is I had to look",00:36:06.850,00:36:08.350
"at all of my opponent's
moves, possible moves,",00:36:08.350,00:36:11.040
"to see if anyone of
them could take my king.",00:36:11.040,00:36:13.120
"Because in regular chess,
it's illegal to put your king",00:36:13.120,00:36:15.921
into check.,00:36:15.921,00:36:16.420
"So you better not
even allow that move.",00:36:16.420,00:36:18.830
"And regardless,
getting into checkmate",00:36:18.830,00:36:20.500
is negative infinity for you.,00:36:20.500,00:36:22.670
"So it takes a really long
time to do static evaluations,",00:36:22.670,00:36:27.100
"at least good ones, usually.",00:36:27.100,00:36:29.380
You want to avoid them.,00:36:29.380,00:36:30.400
"Because they're not just
some number on the page.",00:36:30.400,00:36:32.740
"They are some function
you wrote that does",00:36:32.740,00:36:34.910
"a very careful analysis of the
state of the game and says,",00:36:34.910,00:36:38.230
"I'm good to heuristically
guess that my value is",00:36:38.230,00:36:41.770
"pi, or some other
number, and then rates",00:36:41.770,00:36:45.580
that compared to other states.,00:36:45.580,00:36:47.060
"Does that make
sense to everyone?",00:36:47.060,00:36:49.530
"So the answer to the
hypothetical question",00:36:49.530,00:36:51.790
"that might have been
on the old test, when",00:36:51.790,00:36:53.628
"the person said, I've got this
great idea where you do tons",00:36:53.628,00:36:56.086
"of static evaluation,
and you don't",00:36:56.086,00:36:57.544
"have to do this long
alpha-beta, is, don't do that.",00:36:57.544,00:37:00.620
"The static evaluations
actually take a long time.",00:37:00.620,00:37:04.805
"Does that clear it up
for people who asked me",00:37:04.805,00:37:06.680
"before about what is a static
evaluation, why are the leaf",00:37:06.680,00:37:11.130
nodes called static?,00:37:11.130,00:37:12.030
"And you might ask, why are
some of these static just",00:37:14.730,00:37:17.550
arbitrarily?,00:37:17.550,00:37:19.140
"The answer is, when you're
running out of time to expand",00:37:19.140,00:37:23.030
"deeper, and you just need to
stop that stage of the game--",00:37:23.030,00:37:26.270
"maybe it's just
getting too hairy,",00:37:26.270,00:37:27.744
"maybe it's spreading
out too much,",00:37:27.744,00:37:29.160
"you have some
heuristic that says,",00:37:29.160,00:37:30.760
"this is where I
stop for now-- it's",00:37:30.760,00:37:33.500
a heuristic guess of the value.,00:37:33.500,00:37:35.740
"It's kind of like those
heuristic values in the search",00:37:35.740,00:37:37.990
tree.,00:37:37.990,00:37:38.330
"It's a guess of
how much work you",00:37:38.330,00:37:39.704
have left to get to the goal.,00:37:39.704,00:37:41.340
"Here, you say, well, I
wish I could go deeper.",00:37:41.340,00:37:43.720
But I just don't have the time.,00:37:43.720,00:37:45.100
"So here's how I think
I'm doing at this level.",00:37:45.100,00:37:48.250
It's not always right.,00:37:48.250,00:37:49.359
"And that's going to
lead us into the answer",00:37:49.359,00:37:51.150
"to one of the questions
about progressive deepening.",00:37:51.150,00:37:53.210
"So I'll put up the
progressive deepening",00:37:53.210,00:37:54.876
question really quickly.,00:37:54.876,00:37:56.050
So the question is this.,00:37:56.050,00:38:00.610
"Let me see, this is
a maximizer-- yes.",00:38:00.610,00:38:02.610
"Suppose that we do progressive
deepening on the tree that",00:38:02.610,00:38:10.515
is only two levels deep.,00:38:10.515,00:38:11.600
"What is progressive deepening
in a nutshell if you don't",00:38:11.600,00:38:13.620
remember from the lecture?,00:38:13.620,00:38:14.930
The idea is this.,00:38:14.930,00:38:17.890
"In this tree, it doesn't work.",00:38:17.890,00:38:20.080
"But in trees that actually
branch like 2 to the n,",00:38:20.080,00:38:22.550
"it doesn't take that much time
to do some of the top levels",00:38:22.550,00:38:26.280
"first and then move on
to the bottom levels.",00:38:26.280,00:38:29.240
Just do them one at a time.,00:38:29.240,00:38:31.250
"So let's say we only did it
up through J. We only did",00:38:31.250,00:38:33.840
the top two levels of the tree.,00:38:33.840,00:38:35.890
"We'd like to reorder the
tree so that alpha-beta",00:38:35.890,00:38:38.690
"can prune as much as it
possibly can, at least we hope.",00:38:38.690,00:38:43.250
"So let's pretend that we
had a psychic awesome genius",00:38:43.250,00:38:47.240
"friend who told us that the
static values when we went up",00:38:47.240,00:38:50.520
"to two levels-- remember,
when we go to two levels,",00:38:50.520,00:38:52.680
"F, G, and J have to get
a static value, right?",00:38:52.680,00:38:55.440
Because we're not going down.,00:38:55.440,00:38:56.750
We do a static evaluation.,00:38:56.750,00:38:58.180
"They get the exact correct
numbers-- 3, 7, and 20.",00:38:58.180,00:39:02.410
"Genius, brilliant.",00:39:02.410,00:39:03.573
"All right, so if
that happens, what",00:39:03.573,00:39:07.500
"is the best way that we
could reorder that tree?",00:39:07.500,00:39:10.200
"Oh yeah, so it's A, B, C, D with
values of 2, 3, 7, 6, 1, 20.",00:39:10.200,00:39:18.880
I'll draw that.,00:39:18.880,00:39:21.880
This is the non-reordered tree.,00:39:21.880,00:39:23.390
"Let's see, so it's
2, 3, 7, 6, 1, 20.",00:39:29.890,00:39:41.410
"So what's the best
way to reorder?",00:39:41.410,00:39:43.584
"Well, first of all,
does anyone remember",00:39:43.584,00:39:45.250
"what Patrick said when he talked
about progressive deepening?",00:39:45.250,00:39:49.300
"Usually no one does, so
don't worry about it.",00:39:49.300,00:39:53.800
"Because at that time
you guys didn't think,",00:39:53.800,00:39:55.880
"oh, I have to do
this for the quiz.",00:39:55.880,00:39:57.390
"You were just
thinking, oh man, we've",00:39:57.390,00:39:58.987
"already heard alpha-beta
and all this other stuff.",00:39:58.987,00:40:01.070
And this is just a small fact.,00:40:01.070,00:40:02.570
But it's a very important fact.,00:40:02.570,00:40:04.650
"And now you know you have
to do it for the quiz.",00:40:04.650,00:40:06.720
"So you're probably
going to remember it.",00:40:06.720,00:40:08.600
"The way you do it is you
try to guess, and you say,",00:40:08.600,00:40:13.510
"which one of these is
going to be a winner?",00:40:13.510,00:40:16.030
"Whichever one I think is going
to be a winner at that level,",00:40:16.030,00:40:19.530
I put first.,00:40:19.530,00:40:21.360
Why is that the case?,00:40:21.360,00:40:22.500
"Well, something interesting
you may have noticed here--",00:40:22.500,00:40:27.110
"whenever you have a winner,
like the middle node,",00:40:27.110,00:40:30.590
"or whenever you have
whatever is the current best",00:40:30.590,00:40:34.060
"for your alpha, you sort
of have to explore out",00:40:34.060,00:40:36.790
a lot of that area.,00:40:36.790,00:40:39.160
"Like for instance, the left
node was our current best at 2.",00:40:39.160,00:40:42.390
"The middle branch
was our current best,",00:40:42.390,00:40:44.250
at that time was 6.,00:40:44.250,00:40:45.130
It was the total best.,00:40:45.130,00:40:46.382
"We had to explore a
good number of nodes.",00:40:46.382,00:40:48.090
"But on the right, we
just saw, oh, there's 1.",00:40:48.090,00:40:50.370
We're done.,00:40:50.370,00:40:50.930
We cut everything off.,00:40:50.930,00:40:53.070
"In other words, the
branch that turns out",00:40:53.070,00:40:55.150
"to be the one that
you take, you have",00:40:55.150,00:40:57.052
"to do a pretty good
amount of exploration",00:40:57.052,00:40:58.760
"to prove that it's
the right one.",00:40:58.760,00:41:00.554
"Whereas if it's
the wrong one, you",00:41:00.554,00:41:01.970
"can sometimes with just one
node say, this is wrong, done.",00:41:01.970,00:41:05.320
"So therefore, if the
one that turns out",00:41:05.320,00:41:07.100
"to be the eventual
winner is first of all,",00:41:07.100,00:41:10.510
"then it's really easy to
reject all the other branches.",00:41:10.510,00:41:13.290
"Do people see that sort of
conceptually a little bit,",00:41:13.290,00:41:16.490
"that if you get the
best node right away,",00:41:16.490,00:41:19.250
"you can just reject all the
wrong ones pretty quickly?",00:41:19.250,00:41:22.390
That's our goal.,00:41:22.390,00:41:23.560
"So how can we, quote, ""get
the right one,"" the best one",00:41:23.560,00:41:25.970
right away?,00:41:25.970,00:41:27.040
"Well, here's how we do it.",00:41:27.040,00:41:30.050
"Let's say we're at B. Which one
is the minimizer likely to pick",00:41:30.050,00:41:33.590
"assuming that our
heuristic is good",00:41:33.590,00:41:35.800
"and that these guesses are
pretty much close to the truth?",00:41:35.800,00:41:38.920
"It turns out they're perfect,
so this is going to work.",00:41:38.920,00:41:41.261
"So which one will
the minimizer pick",00:41:41.261,00:41:42.760
"if it has to choose between
E and F, do we think?",00:41:42.760,00:41:44.801
AUDIENCE: E.,00:41:44.801,00:41:45.534
"PROFESSOR: E, perfect.",00:41:45.534,00:41:46.450
"Which one will it
pick between G and H?",00:41:46.450,00:41:48.981
AUDIENCE: H.,00:41:48.981,00:41:49.481
"PROFESSOR: H. Which one will
it pick between I and J?",00:41:49.481,00:41:51.689
AUDIENCE: I.,00:41:51.689,00:41:52.470
"PROFESSOR: OK, so
what we're saying",00:41:52.470,00:41:54.660
"is we think it's
going to pick E.",00:41:54.660,00:41:56.790
"We think it's going to pick H.
We think it's going to pick I.",00:41:56.790,00:41:59.576
"So first of all, we should
put E before F, H before G,",00:41:59.576,00:42:02.830
"and I before J. Because we think
it's going to pick those first.",00:42:02.830,00:42:06.490
"Those are probably our best ones
to invalidate a poor branch.",00:42:06.490,00:42:10.190
"So now between 2,
6, and 1, which",00:42:10.190,00:42:12.360
"is what we think we're going
to get, which one do we think",00:42:12.360,00:42:15.110
the maximizer is going to take?,00:42:15.110,00:42:16.691
AUDIENCE: 6.,00:42:16.691,00:42:17.190
PROFESSOR: 6.,00:42:17.190,00:42:18.050
"Then if it couldn't take 6, what
would be its next best choice?",00:42:18.050,00:42:21.940
"2, then 1.",00:42:21.940,00:42:23.690
"That's just our
order-- simple as that.",00:42:23.690,00:42:27.120
"It couldn't be
anything easier that",00:42:27.120,00:42:28.630
"evolves really complex trees,
a huge number of numbers,",00:42:28.630,00:42:31.130
and reordering those trees.,00:42:31.130,00:42:33.200
"So C-- you guys told me C, B,
D. You told me C, B, D, I think?",00:42:33.200,00:42:42.905
"Yeah, those are the ones
the maximizer likes.",00:42:42.905,00:42:44.780
"And then the ones the minimizer
likes you told me was H,",00:42:44.780,00:42:49.740
"and before G. Because
H is smaller than G.",00:42:49.740,00:42:53.150
"You guys told me E before F.
And you guys told me I before J.",00:42:53.150,00:43:03.710
"And you guys would be
correct in all regards.",00:43:03.710,00:43:07.120
"We have 6, 7, 2, 3, 1, 20.",00:43:07.120,00:43:12.490
"All the minimizers choose
from smallest to highest.",00:43:12.490,00:43:15.450
"The maximizer chooses from
highest to lowest of the ones",00:43:15.450,00:43:19.840
that the minimizers will take.,00:43:19.840,00:43:21.690
"And if we did that, you
can see we would probably",00:43:21.690,00:43:24.320
save some time.,00:43:24.320,00:43:26.160
Let's see how much time.,00:43:26.160,00:43:27.640
Let's say we looked at H first.,00:43:27.640,00:43:30.770
"Well, if we looked
at H first, we",00:43:30.770,00:43:34.010
"would still have actually had
to look at Q and N. However,",00:43:34.010,00:43:39.060
"we would not have had to
look at K. Do people see why?",00:43:39.060,00:43:43.340
"If we already knew
this branch was 6,",00:43:43.340,00:43:44.970
"as soon as we saw 2 for the
beta here-- 2 is less than 6--",00:43:44.970,00:43:48.160
we could have pruned.,00:43:48.160,00:43:49.752
"We still would have had
to look at I over here.",00:43:49.752,00:43:51.710
"Because you have to
look at at least one",00:43:51.710,00:43:53.480
thing in the new sub-branch.,00:43:53.480,00:43:55.760
"And it actually only would
have saved us one node-- oops.",00:43:55.760,00:44:00.500
"So it winds up that in
total, how many nodes would",00:44:00.500,00:44:04.740
"we have evaluated if we did that
little scheme of reordering?",00:44:04.740,00:44:10.350
"Well, we normally had to
do six-- E, K, Q, N, H, I.",00:44:10.350,00:44:17.050
"How many do we evaluate if we
do this progressive deepening",00:44:17.050,00:44:20.391
scheme?,00:44:20.391,00:44:20.890
"How many times do we run
the static evaluator,",00:44:20.890,00:44:22.845
"which of course you know
the static evaluator takes",00:44:22.845,00:44:24.970
a long time?,00:44:24.970,00:44:26.620
Anyone have a guess?,00:44:26.620,00:44:29.400
"I told you the only one we don't
evaluate is K. Raise your hand.",00:44:29.400,00:44:36.170
"I won't make anyone
give this one.",00:44:36.170,00:44:40.460
"So I said the only
one we save on is K.",00:44:40.460,00:44:43.410
"So we still do E, Q,
N, H, and I over here.",00:44:43.410,00:44:49.180
"There's two possible
answers that I will accept.",00:44:49.180,00:44:51.180
"So you have a higher
chance of guessing it.",00:44:51.180,00:44:53.171
Anyway?,00:44:53.171,00:44:53.670
"Does everyone agree
that we did six before?",00:44:57.200,00:44:59.405
"If we didn't do any
progressive deepening,",00:44:59.405,00:45:01.210
"we just did E, K, Q, N, H, I.
And now we're not doing K. OK,",00:45:01.210,00:45:08.932
people are saying five.,00:45:08.932,00:45:09.890
"All right, good.",00:45:09.890,00:45:11.074
That's not the right answer.,00:45:11.074,00:45:12.240
"But it at least shows that you
can do taking away the one.",00:45:12.240,00:45:15.680
We did at least five over here.,00:45:15.680,00:45:17.489
"There's two possible
answers, though.",00:45:17.489,00:45:19.030
Because look over there.,00:45:19.030,00:45:20.412
"In order to do the
progressive deepening,",00:45:20.412,00:45:22.120
"we had to do those static
evaluations, right?",00:45:22.120,00:45:27.850
"So we either did all
those static evaluations",00:45:27.850,00:45:34.190
"and these five-- E, K, Q, N,
H, I-- static evaluations.",00:45:34.190,00:45:39.470
Because we didn't do the K.,00:45:39.470,00:45:42.590
"Or we might have
saved ourselves.",00:45:42.590,00:45:46.010
"Because maybe we were
smart and decided",00:45:46.010,00:45:47.970
"to cache the static values when
we were going down the tree.",00:45:47.970,00:45:51.899
"It's an implementation detail
that on this test when we asked",00:45:51.899,00:45:54.440
that question we didn't say.,00:45:54.440,00:45:56.210
"What I mean by cache is
when we did it here and saw",00:45:56.210,00:45:58.400
"that E was a 2, and
then here-- oh, we",00:45:58.400,00:46:01.540
"have to do the static value
at E. If we were smart,",00:46:01.540,00:46:03.990
"we might have made a little
hash table or something",00:46:03.990,00:46:06.520
"and put down 2 so we didn't have
to do a static evaluation at E.",00:46:06.520,00:46:09.985
"And if that happened,
well, we save E, H, and I,",00:46:09.985,00:46:12.602
and we do three fewer.,00:46:12.602,00:46:15.270
Does everyone see that?,00:46:15.270,00:46:16.660
"However, that's
still more than six.",00:46:16.660,00:46:18.177
So it didn't save us time.,00:46:18.177,00:46:19.260
"So you might say, oh,
progressive deepening",00:46:19.260,00:46:21.051
is a waste of time.,00:46:21.051,00:46:22.250
But it's not.,00:46:22.250,00:46:23.670
"Because this is a very, very
small, not very branchy tree",00:46:23.670,00:46:28.050
"that was made so that
you guys could easily",00:46:28.050,00:46:30.750
"do alpha-beta and take the
quiz, and it wouldn't be bad.",00:46:30.750,00:46:34.060
"If this was actually branching
even double at each level,",00:46:34.060,00:46:40.120
"it would have, what, 16 nodes
down here at the bottom.",00:46:40.120,00:46:44.310
"Then you would want to be doing
that progressive deepening.",00:46:44.310,00:46:47.390
"So now I ask you a
conceptual riddle question.",00:46:47.390,00:46:51.360
"It's not really that
much of a riddle.",00:46:51.360,00:46:53.180
"But we'll see if
anyone wants to answer.",00:46:53.180,00:46:54.846
"Again, I won't call
on you for this.",00:46:54.846,00:46:57.670
"According to this
test, a student",00:46:57.670,00:46:59.730
"named Steve says,
OK, I know I have",00:46:59.730,00:47:01.730
"to pay to do the
progressive deepening here.",00:47:01.730,00:47:05.320
But let's ignore that.,00:47:05.320,00:47:06.490
"Because it's small in
a large tree, right?",00:47:06.490,00:47:09.320
"It's not going to
take that much.",00:47:09.320,00:47:11.320
"Let's ignore the costs of
the progressive deepening",00:47:11.320,00:47:13.720
"and only look at
how much we do here.",00:47:13.720,00:47:16.450
"He says, when it comes to
performing the alpha-beta",00:47:16.450,00:47:18.920
"on the final level,
I'm guaranteed",00:47:18.920,00:47:21.220
"to always prune at
least as well or better",00:47:21.220,00:47:23.600
"if I rearrange the nodes
based on the best result",00:47:23.600,00:47:25.970
from progressive deepening.,00:47:25.970,00:47:27.830
Do you agree?,00:47:27.830,00:47:28.759
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:47:31.876,00:47:32.751
PROFESSOR: Can I repeat it?,00:47:32.751,00:47:34.250
"OK, the question is,
ignoring the cost",00:47:34.250,00:47:36.850
"that we pay progressively
deepening here-- just",00:47:36.850,00:47:39.170
"forget about it-- at the final
step, at the final iteration,",00:47:39.170,00:47:42.295
"the question is, am I
guaranteed to do at least as",00:47:42.295,00:47:45.590
"well or better in my
alpha-beta pruning",00:47:45.590,00:47:47.530
"when I reorder based
on the best order",00:47:47.530,00:47:51.137
for progressive deepening?,00:47:51.137,00:47:52.220
Here certainly we did.,00:47:52.220,00:47:53.935
"But the question is,
is Steve guaranteed?",00:47:53.935,00:47:57.020
Answer?,00:47:57.020,00:47:58.526
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:47:58.526,00:47:59.675
PROFESSOR: What did you say?,00:47:59.675,00:48:00.841
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:48:00.841,00:48:02.162
"PROFESSOR: That's the
answer and the why,",00:48:02.162,00:48:03.870
which we asked to explain.,00:48:03.870,00:48:05.150
"The answer we got is, doesn't
that depend on the heuristic?",00:48:05.150,00:48:08.160
Perfectly correct.,00:48:08.160,00:48:09.025
"The answer is, no,
we're not guaranteed,",00:48:09.025,00:48:11.130
and it depends on the heuristic.,00:48:11.130,00:48:12.780
"So if we were
guaranteed, that would",00:48:12.780,00:48:14.920
"be our heuristic was
godlike, like this heuristic.",00:48:14.920,00:48:17.310
"If your heuristic
already tells you",00:48:17.310,00:48:18.960
"the correct answer no matter
what, don't do game search.",00:48:18.960,00:48:22.180
"Just go to the
empty chess board,",00:48:22.180,00:48:25.340
"put all the pieces
in the front rows,",00:48:25.340,00:48:28.170
"and run static
evaluator on that.",00:48:28.170,00:48:29.990
"And it'll say, oh, it looks
like with this game not",00:48:29.990,00:48:33.110
"started that white is stupid,
so black will win in 15 turns.",00:48:33.110,00:48:36.466
And then you're done.,00:48:36.466,00:48:37.340
And you don't do a search.,00:48:37.340,00:48:38.690
"We know that our heuristic
is flawed in some way.",00:48:38.690,00:48:41.290
It could be very flawed.,00:48:41.290,00:48:42.790
"If it's flawed so
badly that it tells us",00:48:42.790,00:48:44.850
"a very bad result of what's
actually going to happen,",00:48:44.850,00:48:47.320
"even though we think the
minimizer is going to go to H,",00:48:47.320,00:48:49.646
"maybe it's wrong by a
lot and it goes to G.",00:48:49.646,00:48:52.070
"It could take us up
an even worse path",00:48:52.070,00:48:54.590
and make us take longer.,00:48:54.590,00:48:56.180
Question?,00:48:56.180,00:48:56.972
"AUDIENCE: If it's
the heuristic, how",00:48:56.972,00:48:58.506
"could you cache the
values so you didn't",00:48:58.506,00:48:59.804
have to recalculate them later?,00:48:59.804,00:49:01.096
"PROFESSOR: The question
is, how can you",00:49:01.096,00:49:02.720
"cache the values if it's
a heuristic so you don't",00:49:02.720,00:49:04.780
have to recalculate them later?,00:49:04.780,00:49:06.390
"The answer is, it wouldn't
help if there weren't",00:49:06.390,00:49:09.770
"these weird multi-level
things where",00:49:09.770,00:49:11.780
"we stop at E for some reason,
even though it goes down",00:49:11.780,00:49:14.860
to five levels.,00:49:14.860,00:49:16.270
"The way you could cache
it is it is a heuristic.",00:49:16.270,00:49:19.430
But it's consistent.,00:49:19.430,00:49:20.635
"And I don't mean
consistent from search.",00:49:20.635,00:49:22.960
"I mean it's a consistent
heuristic in-- the game state",00:49:22.960,00:49:25.890
"E is, let's say that's the
state where I moved out",00:49:25.890,00:49:29.190
"my knight as the maximizer,
and the minimizer said,",00:49:29.190,00:49:31.530
"you're doing the
knight opening, really,",00:49:31.530,00:49:33.270
and then did a counterattack.,00:49:33.270,00:49:35.820
"No matter how we
get to E, or where",00:49:35.820,00:49:37.740
"we go to get to E, that's
always going to be state E.",00:49:37.740,00:49:40.980
"It's always going to have
the same heuristic value.",00:49:40.980,00:49:43.430
"It's not like some guy who goes
around and just randomly pulls",00:49:43.430,00:49:46.730
a number out of a hat.,00:49:46.730,00:49:49.007
"We're going to have
some value that gives us",00:49:49.007,00:49:50.840
"points based on
state E. And it's",00:49:50.840,00:49:52.510
"going to be the same
any time we go to state",00:49:52.510,00:49:54.670
E. Does that make sense?,00:49:54.670,00:49:57.020
It is a heuristic.,00:49:57.020,00:49:57.980
"But it's always going to give
the same value at E no matter",00:49:57.980,00:50:01.250
how you got to E.,00:50:01.250,00:50:04.500
But it could be really bad.,00:50:04.500,00:50:05.705
"In fact, you might
consider a heuristic",00:50:05.705,00:50:07.330
"that's the opposite of correct
and always tells us the worst",00:50:07.330,00:50:09.830
move and claims it's the best.,00:50:09.830,00:50:11.112
"That's the heuristic that
the minimizer program",00:50:11.112,00:50:13.070
"did to our computer, perhaps.",00:50:13.070,00:50:14.860
"In that case, when we do
progressive deepening and we",00:50:14.860,00:50:17.450
"reorder, we'll probably get
the worst pruning possible.",00:50:17.450,00:50:22.100
We might not.,00:50:22.100,00:50:22.880
But we may.,00:50:22.880,00:50:23.830
"So in that case,
you're not guaranteed.",00:50:23.830,00:50:26.560
I hope that's given a few clues.,00:50:26.560,00:50:28.450
"In tutorial, you
guys are going to see",00:50:28.450,00:50:30.090
"some more interesting
problems that",00:50:30.090,00:50:32.500
go into a few other details.,00:50:32.500,00:50:33.870
"I at least plan on doing
[INAUDIBLE] interesting game",00:50:33.870,00:50:36.160
"problem from last year, which
asked a bunch of varied things",00:50:36.160,00:50:41.649
"that are a little bit
different from these.",00:50:41.649,00:50:43.440
"So it should be a lot of fun,
hopefully, or at least useful,",00:50:43.440,00:50:47.360
to do the next quiz.,00:50:47.360,00:50:49.910
So have a great weekend.,00:50:49.910,00:50:51.550
"Don't stress out too
much about the quiz.",00:50:51.550,00:50:54.711
