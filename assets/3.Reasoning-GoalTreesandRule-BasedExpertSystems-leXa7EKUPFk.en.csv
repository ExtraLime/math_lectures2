"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Ladies and gentlemen, the",00:00:09.330,00:00:10.970
engineers drinking song.,00:00:10.970,00:00:13.670
"Back in the day, I've drunk
quite a lot to that song.",00:00:13.670,00:00:16.309
"And as drinking songs
go, it's not bad.",00:00:16.309,00:00:20.420
"I caution you, however, before
playing this song in the",00:00:20.420,00:00:24.260
"presence of small children,
audition it first.",00:00:24.260,00:00:28.240
"Some of the verses are
sufficiently gross as to make",00:00:28.240,00:00:32.460
a sailor go beyond blushing.,00:00:32.460,00:00:37.130
"It's an interesting song because
there are an infinite",00:00:37.130,00:00:39.380
number of verses.,00:00:39.380,00:00:41.580
Here's the mathematical proof.,00:00:41.580,00:00:43.840
"Suppose there were a finite
number of verses.",00:00:43.840,00:00:46.920
"Then there would be
a last verse.",00:00:46.920,00:00:49.080
"And if there were a last verse,
then some drunk alumni",00:00:49.080,00:00:52.540
would compose a new one.,00:00:52.540,00:00:54.570
"Therefore, there is no last
verse, the size is not finite,",00:00:54.570,00:00:58.400
"and there are an infinite
number of verses.",00:00:58.400,00:01:02.430
"I play it for you today because
I'm an engineer.",00:01:02.430,00:01:05.610
I like to build stuff.,00:01:05.610,00:01:07.336
I build stuff out of wood.,00:01:07.336,00:01:09.010
I build stuff out of metal.,00:01:09.010,00:01:10.810
I build stuff out of rocks.,00:01:10.810,00:01:12.830
"And I especially like
to write programs.",00:01:12.830,00:01:16.470
"I don't know, sometimes people
come to me and say, I'm",00:01:16.470,00:01:20.180
"majoring in computer science,
but I don't",00:01:20.180,00:01:21.960
like to write programs.,00:01:21.960,00:01:23.030
"I've always been mystified
by that.",00:01:23.030,00:01:26.470
"I mean, if you want to show how
tough you are, you can go",00:01:26.470,00:01:29.900
"bungee jumping or drive a nail
through your hand or something",00:01:29.900,00:01:32.430
like that instead.,00:01:32.430,00:01:33.680
"But I've written quite a few
programs for demonstrating",00:01:35.850,00:01:38.750
stuff in this subject.,00:01:38.750,00:01:42.650
"They're all written in Java,
principally because I can",00:01:42.650,00:01:46.520
"therefore make them available to
you and to the rest of the",00:01:46.520,00:01:48.660
world by way of Web Start.,00:01:48.660,00:01:50.785
"A few weeks ago, I was mucking
around with the system and",00:01:50.785,00:01:55.050
"broke the version on the server,
and within 15 minutes,",00:01:55.050,00:01:57.490
"I got an email from somebody
in the depths of Anatolia",00:01:57.490,00:02:01.490
"complaining about it and asking
me to bring it back up.",00:02:01.490,00:02:03.960
"This particular program
is patterned",00:02:07.500,00:02:09.699
after an early AI classic.,00:02:09.699,00:02:14.830
"And it was the business end of
a program written by Terry",00:02:14.830,00:02:19.130
"Winograd, who became, and is,
a professor of computer",00:02:19.130,00:02:24.290
"science at Stanford
University--",00:02:24.290,00:02:27.220
"which is on the west coast
for those of you--",00:02:27.220,00:02:28.940
"on the strength of his work on
the natural language front end",00:02:31.990,00:02:35.510
of this program.,00:02:35.510,00:02:37.100
"But the natural language part
is not what makes it of",00:02:37.100,00:02:40.260
interest for us today.,00:02:40.260,00:02:44.080
"It's more the other
kinds of stuff.",00:02:44.080,00:02:48.440
Let's pile these things up.,00:02:48.440,00:02:51.550
"Now, I'm going to ask to
do something, maybe put",00:02:51.550,00:02:55.320
B2 on top of B7.,00:02:55.320,00:02:58.970
Not bad.,00:03:07.140,00:03:07.840
How about B6 on B3?,00:03:07.840,00:03:09.320
This program's kind of clever.,00:03:18.500,00:03:20.880
Let me do one more.,00:03:25.140,00:03:26.580
Let's put B7 on B2.,00:03:26.580,00:03:28.280
"OK, now let's see.",00:03:39.250,00:03:40.510
Maybe B5 on B2?,00:03:40.510,00:03:42.530
"B4 on B3 first, maybe?",00:03:46.170,00:03:49.730
"Oh, I must have clicked
the wrong button.",00:03:52.820,00:03:55.885
"Oh, there it goes.",00:03:55.885,00:03:56.675
OK.,00:03:56.675,00:03:58.780
Let's put B4 on B1.,00:03:58.780,00:04:02.716
"Agh, my mouse keeps getting
out of control.",00:04:02.716,00:04:08.190
"Now, let's put B1 on B2.",00:04:15.660,00:04:17.519
"This is an example I'm
actually going to",00:04:17.519,00:04:18.779
work out on the board.,00:04:18.779,00:04:20.029
"Oh, I see.",00:04:23.646,00:04:25.740
"My touch pad accidentally
got activated.",00:04:25.740,00:04:27.750
B1 on B2.,00:04:27.750,00:04:30.440
"Now, let's ask a question.",00:04:44.550,00:04:45.800
OK.,00:04:58.075,00:04:59.560
Well.,00:04:59.560,00:05:00.190
SPEAKER 2: [SINGING],00:05:00.190,00:05:01.636
"PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Stop.",00:05:01.636,00:05:03.564
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER],00:05:03.564,00:05:07.420
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Had enough of that.",00:05:07.420,00:05:08.866
Let's see.,00:05:11.760,00:05:12.550
Why did you put--,00:05:12.550,00:05:15.460
"why did you want to
get rid of B4?",00:05:15.460,00:05:22.720
"OK, one--",00:05:22.720,00:05:24.660
SPEAKER 2: [SINGING],00:05:24.660,00:05:28.540
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Maybe
they think, that's what",00:05:28.540,00:05:34.010
"happens when you use software
you write yourself.",00:05:34.010,00:05:35.575
"Why did you want to clear
the top of B2?",00:05:42.010,00:05:51.662
Did I do that?,00:05:51.662,00:05:55.050
"Why did you clear
the top of B1?",00:05:55.050,00:06:01.050
OK.,00:06:01.050,00:06:01.520
SPEAKER 2: [SINGING],00:06:01.520,00:06:03.400
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER],00:06:03.400,00:06:06.700
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Oh, it's haunting me.",00:06:06.700,00:06:08.460
Yeah.,00:06:08.460,00:06:09.290
"So the drinking song is easily
offended, I guess.",00:06:09.290,00:06:13.350
"But I won't develop that
scenario again.",00:06:29.160,00:06:31.310
"What I want to show you is that
this program looks like",00:06:31.310,00:06:35.260
"it's kind of smart, and it
somehow can answer questions",00:06:35.260,00:06:39.430
about its own behavior.,00:06:39.430,00:06:40.230
"Have you ever written a program
that's answered",00:06:40.230,00:06:41.800
"questions about its
own behavior?",00:06:41.800,00:06:44.020
Probably not.,00:06:44.020,00:06:44.620
"Would you like to learn
how to do that?",00:06:44.620,00:06:46.322
OK.,00:06:46.322,00:06:47.680
"So by the end of the hour,
you'll be able to write this",00:06:47.680,00:06:49.470
"program and many more like it
that know how to answer",00:06:49.470,00:06:53.400
"questions about their
own behavior.",00:06:53.400,00:06:55.040
"There have been tens of
thousands of such programs",00:06:55.040,00:06:57.020
"written, but only by people who
know the stuff I'm going",00:06:57.020,00:07:00.175
"to tell you about
right now, OK?",00:07:00.175,00:07:03.080
"So what I want to do is I want
to start by taking this",00:07:03.080,00:07:05.240
"program apart on the board and
talking to you about the",00:07:05.240,00:07:08.500
"modules, the subroutines
that it contains.",00:07:08.500,00:07:12.670
So here it is.,00:07:12.670,00:07:14.070
"The first thing we need
to think about,",00:07:17.440,00:07:20.280
here are some blocks.,00:07:20.280,00:07:21.530
"What has to happen if I'm going
to put the bottom block",00:07:23.600,00:07:27.500
on the larger block?,00:07:27.500,00:07:29.570
"Well, first of all, I have
to find space for it.",00:07:29.570,00:07:32.680
"Then I have to grasp
the lower block.",00:07:32.680,00:07:35.340
"And I have to move it and
I have to ungrasp it.",00:07:35.340,00:07:38.380
"So those are four things I need
to do in order to achieve",00:07:38.380,00:07:42.620
what I want to do.,00:07:42.620,00:07:44.140
"So therefore, I know that the
put-on method has four pieces.",00:07:44.140,00:07:52.450
"It has to find space on
the target block.",00:07:52.450,00:07:57.480
"It has to grasp the block that
it's been commanded to move.",00:07:57.480,00:08:05.500
"Then it has to move, and
then it has to ungrasp.",00:08:05.500,00:08:10.580
"But taking hints from some of
the questions that it did",00:08:15.720,00:08:18.680
"answer before I got haunted by
the music, taking our cue from",00:08:18.680,00:08:23.350
"that, we know that in order to
grasp something, in this",00:08:23.350,00:08:26.850
"particular world, you can't have
anything on top of it.",00:08:26.850,00:08:30.150
"So grasp, therefore, may call
clear top in order to get",00:08:30.150,00:08:36.929
"stuff off from the
target object.",00:08:36.929,00:08:41.710
"And that may happen in an
iterative loop because there",00:08:41.710,00:08:45.020
may be several things on top.,00:08:45.020,00:08:47.450
"And how do you get
rid of stuff?",00:08:47.450,00:08:49.120
"Well, by calling get rid of.",00:08:49.120,00:08:50.370
"And that may go around
a loop several times.",00:08:54.810,00:08:57.660
"And then, the way you get rid of
stuff is by calling put-on.",00:08:57.660,00:09:04.210
"So that gives us recursion, and
it's from the recursion",00:09:04.210,00:09:06.780
"that we get a lot of the
apparent complexity of the",00:09:06.780,00:09:09.110
"program's behavior when
it solves a problem.",00:09:09.110,00:09:13.920
"Now, in order to find space,
you also have to",00:09:13.920,00:09:16.830
call get rid of.,00:09:16.830,00:09:19.070
"So that's where I meant to
put this other iterative",00:09:19.070,00:09:20.820
"loop, not down here.",00:09:20.820,00:09:22.270
"Cleat top has got the iterative
loop inside of it.",00:09:22.270,00:09:25.400
"So that's the structure
of the program.",00:09:25.400,00:09:26.930
It's extremely simple.,00:09:26.930,00:09:29.610
"And you might say to me, well,
how can you get such",00:09:29.610,00:09:31.810
"apparently complex-looking
behavior out of",00:09:31.810,00:09:34.140
such a simple program?,00:09:34.140,00:09:35.065
A legitimate question.,00:09:35.065,00:09:36.665
"But before we tackle that one
head on, I'd like to do a",00:09:36.665,00:09:41.090
"simulation of this program
with a very",00:09:41.090,00:09:42.870
simple blocks problem.,00:09:42.870,00:09:44.120
"And it's the one I almost
showed you, but",00:09:48.790,00:09:51.380
it goes like this.,00:09:51.380,00:09:53.180
Here's B1.,00:09:53.180,00:09:54.786
"We'll call this BX because
I forgot its name.",00:09:54.786,00:09:58.920
Here's BY.,00:09:58.920,00:10:01.250
And here's B2.,00:10:01.250,00:10:03.380
"And the task is to
put B1 on B2.",00:10:03.380,00:10:12.080
"And according to our system
diagram, that results in four",00:10:12.080,00:10:17.090
calls to subroutines.,00:10:17.090,00:10:19.410
We have to find space.,00:10:19.410,00:10:20.660
We have to grasp B1.,00:10:25.750,00:10:27.995
"We have to move, and
then we ungrasp.",00:10:34.270,00:10:38.630
"Now, the way we grasp something
is the first thing",00:10:44.120,00:10:46.260
"we have to do is clear
off its top.",00:10:46.260,00:10:49.900
So grasp calls clear top.,00:11:03.250,00:11:04.640
"And clear top in turn
calls get rid of.",00:11:08.760,00:11:10.900
And let me see.,00:11:18.080,00:11:18.620
Let me keep track of these.,00:11:18.620,00:11:19.650
"This is clearing the top
of B1, and this is",00:11:19.650,00:11:23.630
getting rid of BX.,00:11:23.630,00:11:26.230
"And the way we get rid of BX is
by putting BX on the table.",00:11:26.230,00:11:34.685
"And then that in turn causes
calls to another find space,",00:11:38.710,00:11:44.800
"another grasp, another move,
and another ungrasp.",00:11:44.800,00:11:48.314
"So that's a little trace of
the program as it works on",00:11:48.314,00:11:51.410
this simple problem.,00:11:51.410,00:11:53.960
"So how does it go about
answering the questions that I",00:11:53.960,00:11:56.440
"demonstrated to you
a moment ago?",00:11:56.440,00:11:59.660
"Let's do that by using
this trace.",00:11:59.660,00:12:03.340
"So how, for example, does it
answer the question, why did",00:12:03.340,00:12:09.810
you get rid of BX?,00:12:09.810,00:12:11.060
"[INAUDIBLE], what
do you think?",00:12:17.980,00:12:19.520
"How can it answer
that question?",00:12:19.520,00:12:21.343
SPEAKER 4: [INAUDIBLE],00:12:21.343,00:12:22.593
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
it goes up one level and",00:12:26.280,00:12:29.480
reports what it sees.,00:12:29.480,00:12:31.590
"So it says, and said in the
demonstration, I got rid of BX",00:12:31.590,00:12:36.800
"because I was trying to
clear the top of B1.",00:12:36.800,00:12:40.660
"So if I were to say why did you
clear the top of B1, it",00:12:40.660,00:12:44.325
"would say because I was
trying to grasp it.",00:12:44.325,00:12:47.015
"If I were to say, why did you
grasp B1, it would say because",00:12:47.015,00:12:49.840
I was putting B1 on B2.,00:12:49.840,00:12:51.990
"If I say, why did you put
B1 on B2, it would say,",00:12:51.990,00:12:56.120
"slavishly, because
you told me to.",00:12:56.120,00:12:59.910
"OK, so that's how it deals
with why questions.",00:12:59.910,00:13:03.770
How about how questions?,00:13:03.770,00:13:06.620
"Timothy, what do you think
about that one?",00:13:09.410,00:13:11.680
"How would it go about answering
a question about how",00:13:11.680,00:13:13.400
you did something?,00:13:13.400,00:13:14.650
Do you have a thought?,00:13:17.210,00:13:18.400
"TIMOTHY: Um, yeah, it would
think about what I was trying",00:13:18.400,00:13:21.428
to accomplish.,00:13:21.428,00:13:21.750
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Yeah, but",00:13:21.750,00:13:21.820
how would it do that?,00:13:21.820,00:13:22.710
How would the program do that?,00:13:22.710,00:13:24.550
"We know that answering
a why question makes",00:13:24.550,00:13:26.150
it go up one level.,00:13:26.150,00:13:28.710
"How does it answer
a how question?",00:13:28.710,00:13:30.660
Sebastian?,00:13:30.660,00:13:31.800
"SEBASTIAN: It goes
down one level.",00:13:31.800,00:13:32.560
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
You go down one level.",00:13:32.560,00:13:34.420
"So you start off all the way
up here with a put-on.",00:13:34.420,00:13:40.210
"You will say, oh, well I
did these four things.",00:13:40.210,00:13:42.360
"You say, why did you grasp B1?",00:13:42.360,00:13:43.890
"It will say because I was
trying to clear its top.",00:13:43.890,00:13:46.170
Why did you clear its top?,00:13:46.170,00:13:46.960
"Because I was trying
to get rid of it.",00:13:46.960,00:13:48.930
"Why were you trying
to get rid of it?",00:13:48.930,00:13:50.080
"Because I was trying to
put it on the table.",00:13:50.080,00:13:52.890
"So that's how it answers how
questions, by going down in",00:13:52.890,00:13:56.570
"this tree and this trace of the
program of action so as to",00:13:56.570,00:14:02.280
"see how things are
put together.",00:14:02.280,00:14:05.100
"What are these things that
are being put together?",00:14:05.100,00:14:07.940
"What's the word I've been
avoiding so as to bring this",00:14:07.940,00:14:10.460
to a crescendo?,00:14:10.460,00:14:13.360
"What are these objectives, these
things it wants to do?",00:14:13.360,00:14:17.310
They're goals.,00:14:17.310,00:14:19.530
"So this thing is leaving a
trace, which is a goal tree.",00:14:19.530,00:14:25.780
Does that sound familiar?,00:14:25.780,00:14:29.260
"Three days ago, we talked about
goal trees in connection",00:14:29.260,00:14:31.400
with integration.,00:14:31.400,00:14:33.820
"So this thing is building a goal
tree, also known as an",00:14:33.820,00:14:36.440
and-or tree.,00:14:36.440,00:14:38.320
So this must be an and tree.,00:14:38.320,00:14:40.940
"And if this is an and tree,
are there any and nodes?",00:14:40.940,00:14:44.300
"Sure, there's one right there.",00:14:44.300,00:14:45.590
"So do you think then that you
can answer questions about",00:14:48.860,00:14:53.030
"your own behavior as long as
you build an and-or tree?",00:14:53.030,00:14:56.740
Sure.,00:14:56.740,00:14:58.232
"Does this mean that the
integration program could",00:14:58.232,00:15:00.880
"answer questions about
its own behavior?",00:15:00.880,00:15:04.110
Sure.,00:15:04.110,00:15:05.990
"Because they both build goal
trees, and wherever you got a",00:15:05.990,00:15:08.140
"goal tree, you can answer
certain kinds of questions",00:15:08.140,00:15:10.270
about your own behavior.,00:15:10.270,00:15:11.520
"So let me see if in fact it
really does build itself a",00:15:15.290,00:15:22.910
"goal tree as it solves
problems.",00:15:22.910,00:15:25.660
"So this time, we'll put
B6 on B3 this time.",00:15:25.660,00:15:31.560
"But watch it develop
its goal tree.",00:15:35.400,00:15:37.000
"So in contrast to the simple
example I was working on the",00:15:42.490,00:15:44.950
"board, this gets to be a pretty
complicated goal tree.",00:15:44.950,00:15:49.726
"But I could still answers
questions about behavior.",00:15:49.726,00:15:52.550
"For example, I could say, why
did you put B6 on B3?",00:15:52.550,00:15:59.430
Because you told me to.,00:16:02.440,00:16:04.790
"All right, so the complexity of
the behavior is largely a",00:16:04.790,00:16:08.090
"consequence not of the
complexity of the program in",00:16:08.090,00:16:10.780
"this particular case, but the
building of this giant goal",00:16:10.780,00:16:13.230
"tree as a consequence of the
complexity of the problem.",00:16:13.230,00:16:17.880
"This brings us to one of
our previous matters--",00:16:17.880,00:16:20.400
"early on to one of the gold
star ideas of today.",00:16:20.400,00:16:24.130
"And this gold star idea goes
back to a lecture given in the",00:16:24.130,00:16:29.080
"late '60s by Herb Simon, who was
the first Nobel Laureate",00:16:29.080,00:16:32.470
"in the pseudo Nobel Prize
for economics.",00:16:32.470,00:16:36.030
"Is that right, Bob?",00:16:36.030,00:16:36.690
Was he the first?,00:16:36.690,00:16:37.390
"All right, he was the first
winner of the Nobel Prize,",00:16:37.390,00:16:39.810
"pseudo Nobel Prize
in economics.",00:16:39.810,00:16:42.800
"And in this lecture, which was
titled ""The Sciences of the",00:16:42.800,00:16:45.170
"Artificial,"" he said imagine
that you're looking on a beach",00:16:45.170,00:16:50.500
at the path of a ant.,00:16:50.500,00:16:53.705
"And he said, well, you know,
the path of the ant looks",00:16:53.705,00:16:56.580
extremely complicated.,00:16:56.580,00:16:58.070
"And you're tempted to think the
ant is some kind of genius",00:16:58.070,00:17:02.640
or monster brain ant.,00:17:02.640,00:17:05.670
"But in fact, when you take a
closer look, what you discover",00:17:05.670,00:17:10.780
"is that there are a bunch of
pebbles on the beach, and all",00:17:10.780,00:17:14.490
"the ant is doing is avoiding
those pebbles on his way home.",00:17:14.490,00:17:19.609
"So the complexity of the
behavior, said Simon, is a",00:17:19.609,00:17:23.450
"consequence of the complexity
of the environment, not the",00:17:23.450,00:17:25.900
complexity of the program.,00:17:25.900,00:17:27.900
"So that's the metaphoric
Simon's ant.",00:17:27.900,00:17:30.620
"And what it says is that the
complexity of the behavior is",00:17:30.620,00:17:39.910
"the max of the complexity of the
program and the complexity",00:17:39.910,00:17:50.270
of the environment.,00:17:50.270,00:17:51.520
"So that's something we'll see
many times during the rest of",00:17:58.720,00:18:01.960
the semester.,00:18:01.960,00:18:02.830
"Complex behavior,
simple program.",00:18:02.830,00:18:05.000
"You think it's going
to be complicated.",00:18:05.000,00:18:06.105
"It turns out to be simple
because the problem has the",00:18:06.105,00:18:09.130
"complexity, not the program.",00:18:09.130,00:18:11.810
"So that brings us to check box
three in today's talk, and",00:18:14.350,00:18:17.350
"there's a little bit of a scene
here because now I want",00:18:17.350,00:18:19.520
"to stop talking about
goal-centered programming and",00:18:19.520,00:18:24.140
"start talking about rule-based
expert systems.",00:18:24.140,00:18:28.840
"The rule-based expert systems
were developed in a burst of",00:18:28.840,00:18:35.190
"enthusiasm about the prospects
for commercial applications of",00:18:35.190,00:18:38.870
"artificial intelligence
in the mid-1980s.",00:18:38.870,00:18:45.530
"At that time, it was supposed
lengthy articles are written,",00:18:45.530,00:18:50.010
"but you could account for
useful aspects of human",00:18:50.010,00:18:52.620
"intelligence by writing all the
knowledge in the form of",00:18:52.620,00:18:55.980
simple rules.,00:18:55.980,00:18:57.870
"So if this is true,
then that's true.",00:18:57.870,00:19:02.700
"If you want to achieve
this, then do that.",00:19:02.700,00:19:07.070
"But all the knowledge had to be
encapsulated in the form of",00:19:07.070,00:19:09.690
simple rules.,00:19:09.690,00:19:12.440
"So what might you want
to do with this?",00:19:12.440,00:19:13.780
All sorts of things.,00:19:13.780,00:19:15.110
"Thousands of these systems
were written,",00:19:15.110,00:19:16.510
as I indicated before.,00:19:16.510,00:19:18.760
But here's an example.,00:19:18.760,00:19:19.890
"I'm going to work out an example
having to do with",00:19:19.890,00:19:21.790
identification.,00:19:21.790,00:19:23.870
"And this example is patterned
off of a classic program,",00:19:23.870,00:19:28.980
"strangely also written at
Stanford, called MYCIN.",00:19:28.980,00:19:31.885
"It was developed to
diagnose bacterial",00:19:31.885,00:19:34.210
infections in the blood.,00:19:34.210,00:19:36.470
So you come in.,00:19:36.470,00:19:37.140
"You got some horrible disease,
and the doctor gets curious",00:19:37.140,00:19:40.800
"about what antibiotic would be
perfect for your disease.",00:19:40.800,00:19:43.880
"He starts asking a
lot of questions.",00:19:43.880,00:19:45.500
"So I'm not going to deal with
that because that world has",00:19:49.380,00:19:54.710
"all kinds of unpronounceable
terms like bacterioides and",00:19:54.710,00:19:59.250
anaerobic and stuff like that.,00:19:59.250,00:20:01.310
"So it's completely analogous
to talk about identifying",00:20:01.310,00:20:04.770
"animals in a little zoo, sort
of a small town type of zoo.",00:20:04.770,00:20:12.210
"So I'm going to suggest that
we write down on a piece of",00:20:12.210,00:20:15.320
"paper all the things we can
observe about an animal, and",00:20:15.320,00:20:18.710
"then we'll try to figure
out what the animal is.",00:20:18.710,00:20:23.210
"So I don't know, what
can we start with?",00:20:23.210,00:20:26.610
Has hair.,00:20:26.610,00:20:27.860
"Then there are some
characteristics of the",00:20:34.440,00:20:37.660
following form.,00:20:37.660,00:20:39.080
Has claws.,00:20:39.080,00:20:40.330
Sharp teeth.,00:20:45.590,00:20:46.840
And forward-pointing eyes.,00:20:53.580,00:20:55.060
"And these are all
characteristics of carnivores.",00:21:04.390,00:21:08.120
"We happen to have
forward-pointing eyes too, but",00:21:08.120,00:21:10.190
"that's more because we used to
swing around the trees a lot,",00:21:10.190,00:21:12.560
"and we needed the
stereo vision.",00:21:12.560,00:21:14.420
"And we don't have the claws
and the sharp teeth",00:21:14.420,00:21:16.530
that go with it.,00:21:16.530,00:21:18.400
"But anyhow, those are typically
characteristics of",00:21:18.400,00:21:21.030
"carnivores, as is eating meat.",00:21:21.030,00:21:23.040
"And this particular little
animal we're looking at has",00:21:28.250,00:21:31.090
"also got spots, and
it's very fast.",00:21:31.090,00:21:35.435
What is it?,00:21:39.770,00:21:42.550
"Well, everybody says
it's a cheetah.",00:21:42.550,00:21:44.480
"Let's see how our program
would figure that out.",00:21:44.480,00:21:46.970
"Well, program might say, let's
see if it has hair, then rule",00:21:46.970,00:21:53.210
"one says that that means
it must be a mammal.",00:21:53.210,00:21:57.985
"We can imagine another rule that
says if you have sharp",00:22:03.690,00:22:07.450
"claws, sharp teeth, and
forward-pointing eyes, then",00:22:07.450,00:22:12.410
you're a carnivore.,00:22:12.410,00:22:14.750
"And I'm using sort of hardware
notation here.",00:22:14.750,00:22:17.670
"That's an and gate, right?",00:22:17.670,00:22:19.940
"So that means we have to have
all of these characteristics",00:22:19.940,00:22:23.040
"before we will conclude that
the animal is a carnivore.",00:22:23.040,00:22:26.170
"Now, this animal has been also
observed to eat meat.",00:22:32.490,00:22:36.870
"So that means we've got extra
evidence that the animal is",00:22:36.870,00:22:40.750
carnivorous.,00:22:40.750,00:22:42.700
"And now, because the animal is
a mammal and a carnivore and",00:22:42.700,00:22:52.020
"has spots, and it's very fast,
then the animal is a cheetah.",00:22:52.020,00:22:59.700
"And I hope all of our African
students agree that",00:23:05.116,00:23:07.850
it must be a cheetah.,00:23:07.850,00:23:09.000
It's a small zoo--,00:23:09.000,00:23:09.980
"I mean, a big zoo.",00:23:09.980,00:23:11.420
Who knows what it is?,00:23:11.420,00:23:11.830
"It's probably got some
unpronouncable name--",00:23:11.830,00:23:13.700
there's possibilities.,00:23:13.700,00:23:14.990
"But for our small zoo,
that will do.",00:23:14.990,00:23:17.010
"So we have group now written
down in the form",00:23:17.010,00:23:20.260
of these and gates.,00:23:20.260,00:23:22.270
"Several rules, R1, R2--
and there needs to",00:23:22.270,00:23:27.030
be an and gate here--,00:23:27.030,00:23:29.040
that's R3 and an R4.,00:23:29.040,00:23:31.665
"All of which indicate that
this animal is a cheetah.",00:23:36.950,00:23:40.500
"So we built ourself a little
rule-based expert system that",00:23:40.500,00:23:43.155
"can recognize exactly one
animal, but you could imagine",00:23:43.155,00:23:45.400
"filling out this system with
other rules so that you could",00:23:45.400,00:23:48.540
"recognize giraffes and penguins
and all the other",00:23:48.540,00:23:50.750
"sorts of things you find
in a small zoo.",00:23:50.750,00:23:52.590
"So when you have a system like
this that works as I've",00:23:55.890,00:23:57.920
"indicated, then what we're
going to call that, we're",00:23:57.920,00:24:01.236
"going to give that a special
name, and we're going to call",00:24:01.236,00:24:04.660
"that a forward-chaining
rule-based--",00:24:04.660,00:24:16.560
because it uses rules--,00:24:16.560,00:24:17.810
expert system.,00:24:26.050,00:24:30.403
"And we're going to put expert
in parentheses because when",00:24:34.320,00:24:38.050
"these things were developed,
for marketing reasons, they",00:24:38.050,00:24:41.280
"called them expert systems
instead of novice systems.",00:24:41.280,00:24:45.470
"But are they really experts
in a human sense?",00:24:45.470,00:24:47.490
"Not really, because they have
these knee-jerk rules.",00:24:47.490,00:24:51.880
"They're not equipped with
anything you might want to",00:24:51.880,00:24:53.500
call common sense.,00:24:53.500,00:24:55.800
"They don't have an ability to
deal with previous cases, like",00:24:55.800,00:24:59.700
"we do when we go to
medical school.",00:24:59.700,00:25:01.940
"So they really ought to be
called rule-based novice",00:25:01.940,00:25:04.170
"systems because they reason
like novices on",00:25:04.170,00:25:06.120
the basis of rules.,00:25:06.120,00:25:08.170
"But the tradition
is to call them",00:25:08.170,00:25:09.585
rule-based expert systems.,00:25:09.585,00:25:11.590
"And this one works forward from
the facts we give it to",00:25:11.590,00:25:18.310
"the conclusion off
on the right.",00:25:18.310,00:25:20.260
"That's why it's a
forward-chaining system.",00:25:20.260,00:25:22.350
"Can this system answer
questions",00:25:26.850,00:25:28.420

here where you have multiple",00:25:56.920,00:26:00.180
"reasons for believing that the
thing is a carnivore, that's",00:26:00.180,00:26:02.190
creating an or node.,00:26:02.190,00:26:03.960

can answer questions about",00:26:03.960,00:26:05.820
"your own behavior if you leave
behind a trace of a goal tree.",00:26:05.820,00:26:10.440
So look at this.,00:26:10.440,00:26:11.620
"If I say to it, why were
you interested in",00:26:11.620,00:26:20.260
the animal's claws?,00:26:20.260,00:26:21.520
"Because I was trying to see
if it was a carnivore.",00:26:21.520,00:26:25.020
"How did you know that the
animal is a mammal?",00:26:25.020,00:26:28.710
Because it has hair.,00:26:28.710,00:26:31.190
"Why did you think it
was a cheetah?",00:26:31.190,00:26:33.450
"Because it's a mammal,
a carnivore, has",00:26:33.450,00:26:36.190
"spots, and very fast.",00:26:36.190,00:26:38.010
"So by working forward and
backward in this goal tree,",00:26:38.010,00:26:41.570
"this too can answer questions
about its own behavior.",00:26:41.570,00:26:44.990
"So now you know how, going
forward, you can write",00:26:44.990,00:26:47.020
"programs that answer questions
about their behavior.",00:26:47.020,00:26:50.900
"Either you write the subroutines
so that each one",00:26:50.900,00:26:52.950
"is wrapped around a goal, so
you've got goal-centered",00:26:52.950,00:26:55.710
"programming, or you build a
so-called expert system using",00:26:55.710,00:26:59.420
"rules, in which case it's easy
to make it leave behind a",00:26:59.420,00:27:03.010
"trace of a goal tree, which
makes it possible to answer",00:27:03.010,00:27:06.180

"But now, a little
more vocabulary.",00:27:12.290,00:27:16.330
"I'm going to save time by
erasing all of these things",00:27:16.330,00:27:20.260
"that I previously drew by
way of connections.",00:27:20.260,00:27:22.210
"And I'm going to approach this
zoo in a little different way.",00:27:25.818,00:27:33.610
"I'm going to not ask any
questions about the animal.",00:27:33.610,00:27:39.360
"Instead, I'm going to say,
mommy, is this thing I'm",00:27:39.360,00:27:43.510
looking at a cheetah?,00:27:43.510,00:27:46.220
"And how would mommy go about
figuring it out.",00:27:46.220,00:27:50.640
"In her head, she would say,
well, I don't know.",00:27:50.640,00:27:54.330
"If it's going to be a cheetah,
then it must be the case that",00:27:54.330,00:27:58.425
"it's a carnivore, and it must be
the case that it has spots.",00:27:58.425,00:28:05.010
"And it must be the case
that it's very fast.",00:28:05.010,00:28:09.350
"So so far, what we've
established is that if it's",00:28:09.350,00:28:12.210
"going to be a cheetah, it
has to have the four",00:28:12.210,00:28:14.940
"characteristics that
mommy finds behind",00:28:14.940,00:28:17.880
this rule are four.,00:28:17.880,00:28:20.440
"So instead of working forward
from facts, what I'm going to",00:28:20.440,00:28:24.710
"do is work backward
from a hypothesis.",00:28:24.710,00:28:31.460
"So here the hypothesis is
this thing is a cheetah.",00:28:31.460,00:28:35.720
"How do I go about showing
whether that's true or not?",00:28:35.720,00:28:40.110
"Well, I haven't done anything so
far because all I know is a",00:28:40.110,00:28:44.250
"cheetah if all these things are
true, but are they true?",00:28:44.250,00:28:46.740
"Well, to find out if it's a
mammal, I can use rule one.",00:28:46.740,00:28:51.160
"And if I know or can determine
that the animal has hair, then",00:28:51.160,00:28:55.270
"that part of it is
taken care of.",00:28:55.270,00:28:57.790
"And I can similarly work my way
back through carnivore.",00:28:57.790,00:29:01.990
"I say, well, it's a carnivore if
it has claws, sharp teeth,",00:29:01.990,00:29:06.870
and forward-pointing eyes.,00:29:06.870,00:29:09.680
"And then as much as the
animal in question",00:29:09.680,00:29:11.860
"does, then I'm through.",00:29:11.860,00:29:13.720
I know it's a carnivore.,00:29:13.720,00:29:14.555
"I don't have to go through and
show that it's a carnivore",00:29:14.555,00:29:16.980
another way.,00:29:16.980,00:29:18.230
"So I never actually ask
questions about",00:29:18.230,00:29:20.400
whether it eats meat.,00:29:20.400,00:29:23.600
"Finally, the final two
conditions are met by just an",00:29:23.600,00:29:27.720
inspection of the animal.,00:29:27.720,00:29:30.020
"That's to say, it's
in the database.",00:29:30.020,00:29:31.300
"I don't have to use any rules
to determine that the animal",00:29:31.300,00:29:34.400
has spots and is very fast.,00:29:34.400,00:29:37.290
"So now, I've got everything in
place to say that it's a",00:29:37.290,00:29:39.610
"cheetah, because it's a
carnivore, because it has",00:29:39.610,00:29:42.490
"claws, sharp teeth, and
forward-pointing eyes, and all",00:29:42.490,00:29:45.330
"the rest of this stuff is
similarly determined by going",00:29:45.330,00:29:47.980
"backwards, backwards from the
hypothesis toward the facts,",00:29:47.980,00:29:54.170
"instead of from the facts
forward to the conclusions.",00:29:54.170,00:29:57.730
"So building a system that works
like that, I have a",00:29:57.730,00:30:09.180
"backward-chaining rule-based
expert system.",00:30:09.180,00:30:15.980
"But there's a very important
characteristic of this system",00:30:15.980,00:30:19.040
"in both backward and forward
mode, and that is that this",00:30:19.040,00:30:22.620
thing is a deduction system.,00:30:22.620,00:30:24.400
"That's because it's
working with facts",00:30:29.090,00:30:31.760
to produce new facts.,00:30:31.760,00:30:33.750
"When you have a deduction
system, you can never take",00:30:33.750,00:30:35.730
anything away.,00:30:35.730,00:30:37.920
"But these rule-based systems are
also used in another mode,",00:30:37.920,00:30:40.790
"where it's possible to
take something away.",00:30:40.790,00:30:42.530
"See, in fact world, in deduction
world, you're",00:30:42.530,00:30:45.110
talking about proving things.,00:30:45.110,00:30:46.920
"And once you prove something
is true, it can't be false.",00:30:46.920,00:30:51.320
"If it is, you've got a
contradiction in your system.",00:30:51.320,00:30:54.100
"But if you think of this as a
programming language, if you",00:30:54.100,00:30:56.340
"think of using rules as a
programming language, then you",00:30:56.340,00:30:59.510
"can think of arranging it so
these rules add or subtract",00:30:59.510,00:31:04.770
from the database.,00:31:04.770,00:31:06.380
"Let me show you an example
of a couple of systems.",00:31:06.380,00:31:11.500
"First of all, since I've talked
about the MYCIN system,",00:31:11.500,00:31:15.650
"let me show you an example
of a MYCIN dialogue.",00:31:15.650,00:31:41.910
That's a MYCIN dialogue.,00:31:41.910,00:31:43.750
"And you can see the appearance
of words you have to go to",00:31:43.750,00:31:47.320
medical school to learn.,00:31:47.320,00:31:48.570
"And here's a typical MYCIN rule,
just like the rules for",00:31:51.000,00:31:53.830
"doing zoo analysis, only a
more complicated domain.",00:31:53.830,00:31:58.252
"But here's another example of a
system that was written, not",00:31:58.252,00:32:01.130
"in the '80s, but just a couple
of years ago by a student in",00:32:01.130,00:32:04.300
"the architecture department,
Ph.D. thesis.",00:32:04.300,00:32:09.340
"He was interested in the
architecture of a Portuguese",00:32:09.340,00:32:13.150
architect named Siza.,00:32:13.150,00:32:15.250
"And Siza's done a lot of
mass housing stuff.",00:32:15.250,00:32:18.180
"And Siza has the idea that you
ought to be able to design",00:32:18.180,00:32:20.570
your own house.,00:32:20.570,00:32:22.500
"And so Jose Duarte, a Portuguese
student, a Ph.D.",00:32:22.500,00:32:27.240
"student in architecture, wrote
a rule-based system that was",00:32:27.240,00:32:31.260
"capable of designing Siza-like
houses in response to the",00:32:31.260,00:32:35.950
"requirements and recommendations
and desires of",00:32:35.950,00:32:39.080
"the people who are going
to occupy the houses.",00:32:39.080,00:32:42.740
"So the most compelling part of
this thing, of this exercise,",00:32:42.740,00:32:46.150
"was that Duarte took some of
the designs of the program,",00:32:46.150,00:32:51.780
"mixed them up with some of the
designs of Siza, and put them",00:32:51.780,00:32:55.330
"in front of Siza, and said,
which ones did you do?",00:32:55.330,00:32:58.840
And Siza couldn't tell.,00:32:58.840,00:33:01.550
"So somehow, the rule-based
system that was built using",00:33:01.550,00:33:04.600
"this kind of technology was
sufficient to confuse even the",00:33:04.600,00:33:08.530
"expert that they were
patterned after.",00:33:08.530,00:33:13.040
"But this program is a
little complicated.",00:33:13.040,00:33:14.555
"It, too, has its own
specialized lingo.",00:33:14.555,00:33:17.710
"So I'm not going to talk about
it in detail, but rather talk",00:33:17.710,00:33:21.460
"instead about an analogous
problem.",00:33:21.460,00:33:24.320
"And that is a problem that
everyone has faced at one",00:33:24.320,00:33:27.910

but not as",00:36:27.690,00:36:31.690
much as I would like.,00:36:31.690,00:36:32.950
"And so in order to really make
progress on tasks like this,",00:36:32.950,00:36:37.800
you have to exercise--,00:36:37.800,00:36:38.790
"you know about some principles
of knowledge engineering.",00:36:38.790,00:36:43.040
"So principle number one, which
I've listed over here as part",00:36:43.040,00:36:48.310
"of a gold star idea, is deal
with specific cases.",00:36:48.310,00:36:52.950
"So while you're at the site, if
all you do is talk to the",00:36:52.950,00:36:55.870
"experts like Lisa and
[INAUDIBLE], all you're going",00:36:55.870,00:36:59.210
"to get is vague generalities
because they won't think of",00:36:59.210,00:37:01.490
everything.,00:37:01.490,00:37:03.260
"So what you do is you
say, well, let me",00:37:03.260,00:37:05.620
watch you on the line.,00:37:05.620,00:37:07.870
"And then you'll see that they
have to have some way of",00:37:07.870,00:37:09.810
dealing with the milk.,00:37:09.810,00:37:12.540
"And then you'll see that they
have to have some way of",00:37:12.540,00:37:14.220
dealing with the potato chips.,00:37:14.220,00:37:15.600
"Nobody mentioned potato chips,
except insofar as they might",00:37:15.600,00:37:19.150
be squishy.,00:37:19.150,00:37:20.400
"We don't have a definition
for squishy.",00:37:22.650,00:37:24.520
"Nobody talked about
the macaroni.",00:37:24.520,00:37:27.840
"And no one talked about
the motor oil.",00:37:27.840,00:37:29.790
This is a convenience store.,00:37:29.790,00:37:32.050
"I don't want that in the
same bag with the meat.",00:37:32.050,00:37:35.240
"And then no one talked
about canned stuff.",00:37:35.240,00:37:37.890
Here's a can of olives.,00:37:37.890,00:37:40.450
"So by looking at specific cases,
you elicit from people",00:37:40.450,00:37:45.930
"knowledge they otherwise would
not have thought to give you.",00:37:45.930,00:37:48.620
"That's knowledge engineering
rule number one.",00:37:51.210,00:37:55.450
"And within a very few minutes,
you'll have all three",00:37:55.450,00:37:57.310
"knowledge engineering rules and
be prepared to be a highly",00:37:57.310,00:37:59.480
paid knowledge engineer.,00:37:59.480,00:38:00.730
"Heuristic, let's call
these heuristics.",00:38:03.190,00:38:05.350
"Heuristic number one,
specific cases.",00:38:05.350,00:38:07.120
"Heuristic number two is ask
questions about things that",00:38:07.120,00:38:11.100
"appear to be the same, but are
actually handled differently.",00:38:11.100,00:38:15.070
"So there's some Birds Eye
frozen peas, and here--",00:38:15.070,00:38:20.888
"ugh, some fresh cut
sweet peas.",00:38:20.888,00:38:27.160
"And to me, the person who's
never touched a grocery bag in",00:38:27.160,00:38:31.540
"my life-- maybe I'm
from Mars--",00:38:31.540,00:38:33.900
I can't tell the difference.,00:38:33.900,00:38:34.990
They're both peas.,00:38:34.990,00:38:36.910
"But I observe that the experts
are handling these objects",00:38:36.910,00:38:40.980
differently.,00:38:40.980,00:38:42.650
"So I say, why did you handle
those peas differently from",00:38:42.650,00:38:45.940
"those peas, and what
do they say?",00:38:45.940,00:38:48.250
"One's canned, and
one's frozen.",00:38:48.250,00:38:51.410
So what happens?,00:38:51.410,00:38:53.150
"Bingo, I've got some new
words in my vocabulary.",00:38:53.150,00:38:57.280
"And those new vocabulary words
are going to give me power",00:38:57.280,00:38:59.660
"over the domain because
I can now use",00:38:59.660,00:39:01.570
those words in my rules.,00:39:01.570,00:39:03.380
"And I can write rules like if
frozen, then put them all",00:39:03.380,00:39:07.540
"together in a little
plastic bag.",00:39:07.540,00:39:09.910
"Actually, that's too
complicated, but that's what",00:39:09.910,00:39:11.660
"we end up doing, right?",00:39:11.660,00:39:13.000
"Why do we put them
all together in a",00:39:13.000,00:39:14.720
little plastic bag?,00:39:14.720,00:39:16.141
SPEAKER 8: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:16.141,00:39:18.105
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
What's that?",00:39:18.105,00:39:19.087
SPEAKER 8: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:19.087,00:39:20.070
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Well, there are two",00:39:20.070,00:39:20.690
explanations.,00:39:20.690,00:39:21.940
There's the MIT explanation.,00:39:24.390,00:39:26.750
"We know that temperature flow
is equal to the fourth power",00:39:26.750,00:39:31.120
"of the temperature difference
and the surface area and all",00:39:31.120,00:39:33.400
that kind of stuff.,00:39:33.400,00:39:34.130
"We want to get them all together
in a ball, sphere.",00:39:34.130,00:39:39.500
"The normal explanation is that
they're going to melt anyway,",00:39:39.500,00:39:41.660
"so they might as well not
get everything else wet.",00:39:41.660,00:39:43.808
All right.,00:39:43.808,00:39:44.784
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER],00:39:44.784,00:39:50.640
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
that's heuristic number two.",00:39:50.640,00:39:52.760
"And actually, there's heuristic
number three, that I",00:39:52.760,00:39:56.140
"just want to relate to you for
the first time because I have",00:39:56.140,00:39:59.860
"been dealing with it a lot
over this past summer.",00:39:59.860,00:40:01.770
"Heuristic number three is you
build a system, and you see",00:40:01.770,00:40:04.160
when it cracks.,00:40:04.160,00:40:05.820
"And when it cracks is when you
don't have one of the rules",00:40:05.820,00:40:07.770
you need in order to execute--,00:40:07.770,00:40:11.130
"in order to get the program
to execute as",00:40:11.130,00:40:13.180
you want it to execute.,00:40:13.180,00:40:14.890
"So if I were to write a grocery
store bagging program",00:40:14.890,00:40:17.730
"and have it bag some groceries,
again, eventually",00:40:17.730,00:40:20.290
"it would either make a mistake
or come to a grinding halt,",00:40:20.290,00:40:22.680
"and bingo, I know that there's
a missing rule.",00:40:22.680,00:40:24.350
"Isn't that what happens when you
do a problem set, and you",00:40:28.150,00:40:32.090
hit an impasse?,00:40:32.090,00:40:34.360
"You're performing an experiment
on yourself, and",00:40:34.360,00:40:36.920
"you're discovering that you
don't have the whole program.",00:40:36.920,00:40:40.560
"In fact, I've listed this as a
gold star idea having to do",00:40:40.560,00:40:45.140
"with engineering yourself
because all of these things",00:40:45.140,00:40:47.460
"that you can do for knowledge
engineering are things you can",00:40:47.460,00:40:50.400
"do when you learn a new
subject yourself.",00:40:50.400,00:40:52.170
"Because essentially, you're
making yourself into an expert",00:40:52.170,00:40:54.730
"system when you're learning
circuit theory or",00:40:54.730,00:40:56.940
"electromagnetism or something
of that sort.",00:40:56.940,00:41:00.230
"You're saying to yourself,
well, let's look at some",00:41:00.230,00:41:02.420
specific cases.,00:41:02.420,00:41:04.310
"Well, what are the vocabulary
items here that tell me why",00:41:04.310,00:41:06.870
"this problem is different
from that problem?",00:41:06.870,00:41:08.450
"Oh, this is a cylinder
instead of a sphere.",00:41:08.450,00:41:11.380
"Or you're working with a problem
set, and you discover",00:41:11.380,00:41:13.200
"you can't work with the problem,
and you need to get",00:41:13.200,00:41:16.000
"another chunk of knowledge
that makes it possible",00:41:16.000,00:41:17.860
for you to do it.,00:41:17.860,00:41:19.600
"So this sort of thing, which
you think of primarily as a",00:41:19.600,00:41:23.260
"mechanism, heuristics for doing
knowledge engineering,",00:41:23.260,00:41:26.400
"are also mechanisms for making
yourself smarter.",00:41:26.400,00:41:32.515
"So that concludes what I want to
talk with you about today.",00:41:36.910,00:41:40.990
"But the bottom line is, that
if you build a rule-based",00:41:40.990,00:41:43.320
"expert system, it can
answer questions",00:41:43.320,00:41:44.880
about its own behavior.,00:41:44.880,00:41:46.540
"If you build a program that's
centered on goals, it can",00:41:46.540,00:41:49.850
"answer questions about
its own behavior.",00:41:49.850,00:41:51.815
"If you build an integration
program, it can answer",00:41:51.815,00:41:54.190
"questions about its
own behavior.",00:41:54.190,00:41:56.120
"And if you want to build one of
these systems, and you need",00:41:56.120,00:41:57.950
"to extract knowledge from an
expert, you need to approach",00:41:57.950,00:42:00.760
"it with these kinds of
heuristics because the expert",00:42:00.760,00:42:03.610
"won't think what to tell you
unless you elicit that",00:42:03.610,00:42:06.320
"information by specific cases,
by asking questions about",00:42:06.320,00:42:09.680
"differences, and by ultimately
doing some experiments to see",00:42:09.680,00:42:12.760
where your program is correct.,00:42:12.760,00:42:14.850
"So that really concludes what I
had to say, except I want to",00:42:14.850,00:42:19.960
"ask the question, is this all
we need to know about human",00:42:19.960,00:42:25.080
intelligence?,00:42:25.080,00:42:26.010
Can these things be--,00:42:26.010,00:42:27.260
are these things really smart?,00:42:27.260,00:42:30.500
"And the traditional answer is
no, they're not really smart",00:42:30.500,00:42:34.890
"because their intelligence is
this sort of thin veneer.",00:42:34.890,00:42:39.610
"And when you try to get
underneath it, as written,",00:42:39.610,00:42:44.090
they tend to crack.,00:42:44.090,00:42:46.160
"For example, we talk about a
rule, we could talk about a",00:42:46.160,00:42:50.030
"rule that knows that you should
put the potato chips on",00:42:50.030,00:42:53.290
the top of the bag.,00:42:53.290,00:42:54.540
"But a program that knows that
would have no idea why you",00:42:57.080,00:43:00.375
"would want to put the potato
chips on top of the bag.",00:43:00.375,00:43:03.660
"They wouldn't know that if you
put them on the bottom of the",00:43:03.660,00:43:05.610
"bag, they'll get crushed.",00:43:05.610,00:43:09.870
"And it wouldn't know that if
they get crushed, the customer",00:43:09.870,00:43:13.310
"will get angry, because people
don't like to eat crushed",00:43:13.310,00:43:17.630
potato chips.,00:43:17.630,00:43:19.340
"So that's what I mean when I
say the knowledge of these",00:43:19.340,00:43:21.280
things tends to be a veneer.,00:43:21.280,00:43:23.790
"So the MYCIN program, during
debugging, once prescribed a",00:43:23.790,00:43:28.000
"barrel of penicillin to be
administered to a patient for",00:43:28.000,00:43:31.595
its disease.,00:43:31.595,00:43:34.340
"They don't know, they don't
have any common sense.",00:43:34.340,00:43:38.510
"So the question then becomes,
well, I don't know.",00:43:38.510,00:43:43.620
Does rule-based--,00:43:43.620,00:43:45.460
"do rules have anything to
do with common sense?",00:43:45.460,00:43:50.550
"And I'm becoming a little bit
agnostic on that subject.",00:43:50.550,00:43:53.340
"Because there are certain
indications, there are certain",00:43:57.840,00:44:00.440
"situations, in which rules could
be said to play a role",00:44:00.440,00:44:06.600
"in our ordinary understanding
of things.",00:44:06.600,00:44:08.495
"Would you like to see
a demonstration?",00:44:11.250,00:44:13.560
"What I'm going to show you,
when the clip speaks up--",00:44:13.560,00:44:17.060
"well, before I make any
promises, let me see if I'm",00:44:17.060,00:44:21.640
actually connected to the web.,00:44:21.640,00:44:22.910

"Yeah, that's me.",00:44:39.700,00:44:40.950
Sounds good.,00:44:53.820,00:44:55.070
"OK, I just tested the system,
and I've seen it is actually",00:45:23.930,00:45:26.650
connected to the web.,00:45:26.650,00:45:28.330
"And I'm going to adjust some
systems options here.",00:45:28.330,00:45:32.230
I'll get rid of the text box.,00:45:32.230,00:45:35.120
"And we'll get rid of those
changes scale a little bit.",00:45:35.120,00:45:38.160
"What I'm going to do is I'm
going to read a little",00:45:38.160,00:45:40.780
synopsis of the Macbeth plot.,00:45:40.780,00:45:44.050
You're MIT students.,00:45:44.050,00:45:45.190
"I'm sure you're all classically
educated and very",00:45:45.190,00:45:46.920
"familiar with Shakespearean
plots.",00:45:46.920,00:45:49.830
So I'm going to read one.,00:45:49.830,00:45:52.980
"I'm going to read a version
of a Macbeth plot.",00:45:52.980,00:45:56.330
"And it's going to go
along like this.",00:45:56.330,00:45:59.260
"It's basically reading
a rule base so far.",00:45:59.260,00:46:03.040
"And pretty soon, it's going to
get beyond the rule base and",00:46:03.040,00:46:07.910
"start reading the
Macbeth story.",00:46:07.910,00:46:09.435
And there it is.,00:46:12.320,00:46:13.740
It's read the Macbeth story.,00:46:13.740,00:46:14.720
"Let me show you what the Macbeth
story looks like as",00:46:14.720,00:46:16.860
"it's actually retained
by the system.",00:46:16.860,00:46:18.660
That's it.,00:46:18.660,00:46:19.320
Read that.,00:46:19.320,00:46:20.570
"OK, you ran out of
time because the",00:46:25.480,00:46:27.310
machine's already finished.,00:46:27.310,00:46:28.490
"It takes about five seconds
to read this story.",00:46:28.490,00:46:30.830
"Now, as you look at this little
synopsis of Macbeth,",00:46:30.830,00:46:32.920
"there are a couple
things to note.",00:46:32.920,00:46:35.510
"For one thing, it says that
Duncan is murdered.",00:46:35.510,00:46:39.090
"Duncan, I hope this doesn't
bother you.",00:46:39.090,00:46:42.650
Duncan is murdered by Macbeth.,00:46:42.650,00:46:44.530
"But at no time does it say
that Duncan is dead.",00:46:44.530,00:46:48.205
"But you know Duncan's dead
because he was murdered.",00:46:48.205,00:46:50.800
"If murdered, then dead.",00:46:50.800,00:46:53.168
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER].,00:46:53.168,00:46:55.000
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
if you look a little further",00:46:55.000,00:46:56.640
"down, what you see is that
Macduff kills Macbeth.",00:46:56.640,00:47:01.890
"Fourth line up from
the bottom.",00:47:01.890,00:47:04.260
Why did Macduff kill Macbeth?,00:47:04.260,00:47:08.410
"Doesn't say why in this story,
but you have no trouble",00:47:08.410,00:47:11.630
"figuring out that it's
because he got angry.",00:47:11.630,00:47:16.950
"And when you get angry, you
don't necessarily kill",00:47:16.950,00:47:19.970
"somebody, but it's possible.",00:47:19.970,00:47:21.300
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER].,00:47:21.300,00:47:24.190
"PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
now that you see what's in the",00:47:24.190,00:47:25.240
"story, let me take you
back to this display.",00:47:25.240,00:47:28.550
"It's what we call an
elaboration graph.",00:47:28.550,00:47:31.210
"And when I blow it up, you can
see that there's some familiar",00:47:31.210,00:47:33.360
looking things in there.,00:47:33.360,00:47:35.340
"For example, up here in the
left-hand corner, Macbeth",00:47:35.340,00:47:38.630
"murders Duncan, right
over there.",00:47:38.630,00:47:41.700
"And over here, Macduff
kills Macbeth.",00:47:41.700,00:47:45.510
"And if you look at what is a
consequence of that, it looks",00:47:45.510,00:47:50.710
"like there must be a rule that
says if you murder somebody,",00:47:50.710,00:47:53.010
you harm them.,00:47:53.010,00:47:54.670
"And if you murder somebody,
then they're dead.",00:47:54.670,00:47:58.540
"And one reason why you might
kill somebody is because they",00:47:58.540,00:48:01.270
angered you.,00:48:01.270,00:48:02.500
"And if you go the other way,
one consequence of killing",00:48:02.500,00:48:05.880
"somebody is that you harm them,
and that they die too.",00:48:05.880,00:48:10.160
"And if you harm somebody, they
get angry, and their state",00:48:10.160,00:48:13.120
goes negative.,00:48:13.120,00:48:14.370
"So that suggests that there are
some things that we have",00:48:19.050,00:48:22.550
"on our hands that are very
compiled and very, strangely",00:48:22.550,00:48:26.145
"enough, very rule-like
in their character.",00:48:26.145,00:48:30.970
"Now, to close, I'm just
going to read Hamlet.",00:48:30.970,00:48:35.730
"The Hamlet demonstration is
much like the Macbeth one.",00:48:35.730,00:48:38.900
"In fact, Hamlet and Macbeth are
very alike in their plot.",00:48:38.900,00:48:42.270
"But there's one thing that's
well-illustrated by our",00:48:42.270,00:48:44.530
"particular capturing
of Hamlet here.",00:48:44.530,00:48:47.940
"And that is that you'll note
that the ratio of gray stuff",00:48:47.940,00:48:50.910
"to white stuff is
considerable.",00:48:50.910,00:48:54.060
"The gray stuff is stuff that
has been deduced by rules.",00:48:54.060,00:48:59.810
"And the reason there's so much
gray stuff in this Hamlet",00:48:59.810,00:49:02.140
"story is because everybody's
related to everybody else.",00:49:02.140,00:49:05.380
"So when you kill anybody, you
irritate everybody else.",00:49:05.380,00:49:08.920
So look at that.,00:49:12.690,00:49:13.750
"A few white things, those are
the things that are explicit",00:49:13.750,00:49:16.310
"in the story, and lots
of gray stuff.",00:49:16.310,00:49:18.630
"So what this is suggesting is
that when we tell a story,",00:49:18.630,00:49:22.270
"it's mostly a matter of
controlled hallucination.",00:49:22.270,00:49:25.440
"I know what rules are in your
head, so I could take",00:49:25.440,00:49:28.560
"advantage of that in telling the
story and not have to tell",00:49:28.560,00:49:31.030
"you anything I'm sure you're
going to know.",00:49:31.030,00:49:33.490
"And so that's why, we've
discovered, that storytelling",00:49:33.490,00:49:36.640
"is largely a matter of just
controlling how you're going",00:49:36.640,00:49:39.500
"along, a kind of controlled
hallucination.",00:49:39.500,00:49:41.010
