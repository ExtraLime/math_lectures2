"Professor: I am Haynes
Miller, I am substituting",00:00:22.240,00:00:25.050
for David Jerison today.,00:00:25.050,00:00:26.510
"So you have a substitute
teacher today.",00:00:26.510,00:00:41.880
"So I haven't been here
in this class with you",00:00:41.880,00:00:44.400
"so I'm not completely
sure where you are.",00:00:44.400,00:00:47.580
"I think you've just been
talking about differentiation",00:00:47.580,00:00:52.170
"and you've got some examples
of differentiation like these",00:00:52.170,00:00:56.840
"basic examples: the
derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1).",00:00:56.840,00:00:59.860
"But I think maybe you've
spent some time computing",00:01:03.197,00:01:05.280
"the derivative of the sine
function as well, recently.",00:01:05.280,00:01:11.230
"And I think you have
some rules for extending",00:01:11.230,00:01:16.290
these calculations as well.,00:01:16.290,00:01:18.950
"For instance, I think you
know that if you differentiate",00:01:18.950,00:01:24.080
"a constant times a
function, what do you get?",00:01:24.080,00:01:27.770
Student: [INAUDIBLE].,00:01:27.770,00:01:32.590
"Professor: The constant
comes outside like this.",00:01:32.590,00:01:36.670
Or I could write (cu)' = cu'.,00:01:36.670,00:01:40.030
"That's this rule,
multiplying by a constant,",00:01:42.550,00:01:45.350
"and I think you also know
about differentiating a sum.",00:01:45.350,00:01:58.870
"Or I could write this
as (u + v)' = u' + v'.",00:01:58.870,00:02:03.650
"So I'm going to be using
those but today I'll",00:02:06.870,00:02:09.850
"talk about a collection
of other rules",00:02:09.850,00:02:12.290
"about how to deal with
a product of functions,",00:02:12.290,00:02:15.080
"a quotient of functions,
and, best of all,",00:02:15.080,00:02:18.180
composition of functions.,00:02:18.180,00:02:20.024
"And then at the end,
I'll have something",00:02:20.024,00:02:21.690
to say about higher derivatives.,00:02:21.690,00:02:23.480
So that's the story for today.,00:02:23.480,00:02:26.670
That's the program.,00:02:26.670,00:02:29.120
"So let's begin by talking
about the product rule.",00:02:29.120,00:02:43.360
"So the product
rule tells you how",00:02:43.360,00:02:44.750
"to differentiate a
product of functions,",00:02:44.750,00:02:46.760
"and I'll just give you
the rule, first of all.",00:02:46.760,00:02:49.270
The rule is it's u'v + uv'.,00:02:49.270,00:02:51.600
It's a little bit funny.,00:02:57.280,00:02:58.500
"Differentiating a
product gives you a sum.",00:02:58.500,00:03:02.320
"But let's see how that works
out in a particular example.",00:03:02.320,00:03:06.730
"For example, suppose
that I wanted",00:03:06.730,00:03:08.270
to differentiate the product.,00:03:08.270,00:03:11.280
"Well, the product
of these two basic",00:03:11.280,00:03:13.890
"examples that we
just talked about.",00:03:13.890,00:03:15.584
"I'm going to use
the same variable",00:03:15.584,00:03:17.000
"in both cases instead of
different ones like I did here.",00:03:17.000,00:03:20.790
"So the derivative
of x^n times sin x.",00:03:20.790,00:03:23.230
So this is a new thing.,00:03:28.430,00:03:30.300
"We couldn't do this without
using the product rule.",00:03:30.300,00:03:36.120
"So the first function is x^n
and the second one is sin x.",00:03:36.120,00:03:39.670
"And we're going to
apply this rule.",00:03:39.670,00:03:41.740
"So u is x^n. u' is, according
to the rule, nx^(n-1).",00:03:41.740,00:03:49.450
"And then I take v and write it
down the way it is, sine of x.",00:03:49.450,00:03:56.029
And then I do it the other way.,00:03:56.029,00:03:57.320
"I take u the way
it is, that's x^n,",00:03:57.320,00:04:00.690
"and multiply it by the
derivative of v, v'.",00:04:00.690,00:04:05.260
We just saw v' is cosine of x.,00:04:05.260,00:04:09.234
So that's it.,00:04:09.234,00:04:11.520
"Obviously, you can
differentiate longer products,",00:04:11.520,00:04:14.980
"products of more things
by doing it one at a time.",00:04:14.980,00:04:20.560
Let's see why this is true.,00:04:20.560,00:04:22.700
"I want to try to show you
why the product rule holds.",00:04:22.700,00:04:25.730
"So you have a standard way
of trying to understand this,",00:04:25.730,00:04:31.490
"and it involves looking at
the change in the function",00:04:31.490,00:04:34.590
"that you're interested
in differentiating.",00:04:34.590,00:04:37.350
"So I should look at how
much the product uv changes",00:04:37.350,00:04:41.390
when x changes a little bit.,00:04:41.390,00:04:44.630
"Well, so how do
compute the change?",00:04:44.630,00:04:47.120
"Well, I write down the
value of the function",00:04:47.120,00:04:49.330
"at some new value
of x, x + delta x.",00:04:49.330,00:04:56.160
"Well, I better write
down the whole new value",00:04:56.160,00:04:58.410
"of the function, and
the function is uv.",00:04:58.410,00:05:01.480
"So the whole new
value looks like this.",00:05:01.480,00:05:05.230
"It's u(x + delta x)
times v(x + delta x).",00:05:05.230,00:05:09.450
That's the new value.,00:05:09.450,00:05:10.960
"But what's the change
in the product?",00:05:10.960,00:05:13.200
"Well, I better subtract
off what the old value",00:05:13.200,00:05:15.410
"was, which is u(x) v(x).",00:05:15.410,00:05:20.920
"Okay, according to the
rule we're trying to prove,",00:05:20.920,00:05:24.950
I have to get u' involved.,00:05:24.950,00:05:27.750
"So I want to involve the
change in u alone, by itself.",00:05:27.750,00:05:31.420
Let's just try that.,00:05:31.420,00:05:32.990
"I see part of the formula for
the change in u right there.",00:05:32.990,00:05:36.620
"Let's see if we can get
the rest of it in place.",00:05:36.620,00:05:40.260
"So the change in x is
(u(x + delta x) - u(x).",00:05:40.260,00:05:46.330
"That's the change in x
[Correction: change in u].",00:05:46.330,00:05:50.080
"This part of it occurs up here,
multiplied by v(x + delta x),",00:05:50.080,00:05:54.760
so let's put that in too.,00:05:54.760,00:05:57.890
"Now this equality sign
isn't very good right now.",00:05:57.890,00:06:00.440
"I've got this
product here so far,",00:06:00.440,00:06:04.770
"but I've introduced
something I don't like.",00:06:04.770,00:06:06.690
"I've introduced u times
v(x delta x), right?",00:06:06.690,00:06:09.800
Minus that.,00:06:09.800,00:06:12.010
"So the next thing I'm gonna do
is correct that little defect",00:06:12.010,00:06:17.120
"by adding in u(x)
v(x + delta x).",00:06:17.120,00:06:24.620
"Okay, now I cancelled off
what was wrong with this line.",00:06:24.620,00:06:28.834
"But I'm still not
quite there, because I",00:06:28.834,00:06:30.500
haven't put this in yet.,00:06:30.500,00:06:32.670
"So I better subtract off
uv, and then I'll be home.",00:06:32.670,00:06:38.420
"But I'm going to do
that in a clever way,",00:06:38.420,00:06:40.500
"because I noticed that
I already have a u here.",00:06:40.500,00:06:43.900
"So I'm gonna take
this factor of u",00:06:43.900,00:06:46.620
"and make it the
same as this factor.",00:06:46.620,00:06:48.560
"So I get u(x) times this,
minus u(x) times that.",00:06:48.560,00:06:52.510
"That's the same thing as
u times the difference.",00:06:52.510,00:06:57.180
"So that was a
little bit strange,",00:06:57.180,00:06:59.406
"but when you stand
back and look at it,",00:06:59.406,00:07:01.030
"you can see multiplied out,
the middle terms cancel.",00:07:01.030,00:07:04.280
And you get the right answer.,00:07:04.280,00:07:07.340
"Well I like that because
it's involved the change in u",00:07:07.340,00:07:10.420
"and the change in v. So this
is equal to delta u times v(x +",00:07:10.420,00:07:16.810
"delta x) minus u(x) times
the change in v. Well,",00:07:16.810,00:07:26.320
I'm almost there.,00:07:26.320,00:07:27.510
"The next step in computing
the derivative is",00:07:27.510,00:07:30.050
"take difference quotient,
divide this by delta x.",00:07:30.050,00:07:42.910
"So, (delta (uv)) /
(delta x) is well,",00:07:42.910,00:07:50.690
"I'll say (delta u / delta
x) times v(x + delta x).",00:07:50.690,00:08:03.150
Have I made a mistake here?,00:08:03.150,00:08:10.000
"This plus magically became a
minus on the way down here,",00:08:10.000,00:08:13.340
so I better fix that.,00:08:13.340,00:08:18.810
"Plus u times (delta
v) / (delta x).",00:08:18.810,00:08:23.260
This u is this u over here.,00:08:23.260,00:08:27.950
"So I've just divided
this formula by delta x,",00:08:27.950,00:08:30.310
"and now I can take the limit
as x goes to 0, so this",00:08:30.310,00:08:34.520
is as delta x goes to 0.,00:08:34.520,00:08:42.070
"This becomes the definition
of the derivative,",00:08:42.070,00:08:46.480
"and on this side, I
get du/dx times...",00:08:46.480,00:08:51.790
"now what happens to this
quantity when delta x goes",00:08:51.790,00:08:57.400
to 0?,00:08:57.400,00:09:02.750
"So this quantity is getting
closer and closer to x.",00:09:02.750,00:09:05.710
"So what happens
to the value of v?",00:09:05.710,00:09:09.000
"It becomes equal to x of v.
That uses continuity of v. So,",00:09:09.000,00:09:14.030
"v(x + delta x) goes
to v(x) by continuity.",00:09:14.030,00:09:22.590
"So this gives me times v,
and then I have u times,",00:09:22.590,00:09:26.586
"and delta v / delta
x gives me dv/dx.",00:09:26.586,00:09:30.680
And that's the formula.,00:09:30.680,00:09:31.819
"That's the formula
as I wrote it down",00:09:31.819,00:09:33.360
at the beginning over here.,00:09:33.360,00:09:35.660
"The derivative of a product
is given by this sum.",00:09:35.660,00:09:39.170
Yeah?,00:09:39.170,00:09:46.223
"Student: How did you
get from the first line",00:09:46.223,00:09:48.056
"to the second of
the long equation?",00:09:48.056,00:09:49.514
Professor: From here to here?,00:09:49.514,00:09:51.390
Student: Yes.,00:09:51.390,00:09:53.460
"Professor: So maybe it's easiest
to work backwards and verify",00:09:53.460,00:09:56.380
"that what I wrote
down is correct here.",00:09:56.380,00:09:59.800
"So, if you look there's a u
times v(x + delta x) there.",00:09:59.800,00:10:05.130
And there's also one here.,00:10:05.130,00:10:07.840
"And they occur with
opposite signs.",00:10:07.840,00:10:09.940
So they cancel.,00:10:09.940,00:10:11.490
"What's left is u(x + delta
x) v(x + delta x) - uv.",00:10:11.490,00:10:20.530
"And that's just
what I started with.",00:10:20.530,00:10:29.120
"Student: [INAUDIBLE]
They cancel right?",00:10:29.120,00:10:33.920
"Professor: I cancelled out
this term and this term,",00:10:33.920,00:10:37.430
and what's left is the ends.,00:10:37.430,00:10:39.700
Any other questions?,00:10:39.700,00:10:41.490
Student: [INAUDIBLE].,00:10:41.490,00:10:49.660
"Professor: Well, I just
calculated what delta uv is,",00:10:49.660,00:10:55.640
"and now I'm gonna divide
that by delta x on my way",00:10:55.640,00:10:57.980
to computing the derivative.,00:10:57.980,00:11:00.250
"And so I copied down the right
hand side and divided delta x.",00:11:00.250,00:11:07.760
"I just decided to divide the
delta u by delta x and delta v",00:11:07.760,00:11:11.550
by delta x.,00:11:11.550,00:11:16.230
Good.,00:11:16.230,00:11:16.990
Anything else?,00:11:16.990,00:11:22.490
"So we have the
product rule here.",00:11:22.490,00:11:24.260
"The rule for differentiating
a product of two functions.",00:11:24.260,00:11:26.980
This is making us stronger.,00:11:26.980,00:11:28.325
"There are many
more functions you",00:11:28.325,00:11:29.700
can find derivatives of now.,00:11:29.700,00:11:31.420
How about quotients?,00:11:31.420,00:11:33.580
"Let's find out how
to differentiate",00:11:33.580,00:11:35.370
a quotient of two functions.,00:11:35.370,00:11:47.669
"Well again, I'll write down what
the answer is and then we'll",00:11:47.669,00:11:50.210
try to verify it.,00:11:50.210,00:11:52.370
So there's a quotient.,00:11:52.370,00:11:55.192
Let me write this down.,00:11:55.192,00:11:56.150
"There's a quotient
of two functions.",00:11:56.150,00:11:58.970
And here's the rule for it.,00:11:58.970,00:12:00.340
"I always have to think about
this and hope that I get it",00:12:00.340,00:12:02.910
right. (u'v - uv') / v^2.,00:12:02.910,00:12:09.140
"This may be the craziest rule
you'll see in this course,",00:12:09.140,00:12:11.900
but there it is.,00:12:11.900,00:12:14.330
"And I'll try to show you why
that's true and see an example.",00:12:14.330,00:12:18.014
Yeah there was a hand?,00:12:18.014,00:12:18.930
Student: [INAUDIBLE],00:12:18.930,00:12:27.300
"Professor: What letters look
the same? u and v look the same?",00:12:27.300,00:12:33.040
"I'll try to make them
look more different.",00:12:33.040,00:12:37.040
"The v's have points
on the bottom.",00:12:37.040,00:12:38.520
"u's have little round
things on the bottom.",00:12:38.520,00:12:41.160
What's the new value of u?,00:12:41.160,00:12:44.980
"The value of u at x + delta
x is u + delta u, right?",00:12:44.980,00:12:55.442
That's what delta u is.,00:12:55.442,00:12:56.400
"It's the change in u when
x gets replaced by delta x",00:12:56.400,00:13:01.327
[Correction: x + delta x].,00:13:01.327,00:13:02.410
"And the change in v, the
new value v, is v + delta v.",00:13:02.410,00:13:09.700
"So this is the new value of u
divided by the new value of v.",00:13:09.700,00:13:13.130
That's the beginning.,00:13:13.130,00:13:16.130
"And then I subtract off
the old values, which",00:13:16.130,00:13:18.705
"are u minus v. This'll
be easier to work out",00:13:18.705,00:13:22.910
when I write it out this way.,00:13:22.910,00:13:26.084
"So now, we'll cross
multiply, as I said.",00:13:26.084,00:13:27.750
"So I get uv + (delta u)v minus,
now I cross multiply this way,",00:13:27.750,00:13:38.890
you get uv - u(delta v).,00:13:38.890,00:13:46.330
"And I divide all this
by (v + delta v)u.",00:13:46.330,00:13:49.980
"Okay, now the reason
I like to do it",00:13:52.840,00:13:55.970
"this way is that you see the
cancellation happening here. uv",00:13:55.970,00:13:59.490
"and uv occur twice and
so I can cancel them.",00:13:59.490,00:14:02.187
"And I will, and I'll answer
these questions in a minute.",00:14:02.187,00:14:04.520
Audience: [INAUDIBLE].,00:14:04.520,00:14:06.260
"Professor: Ooh,
that's a v. All right.",00:14:06.260,00:14:14.030
"Good, anything else?",00:14:14.030,00:14:15.570
That's what all hands were.,00:14:15.570,00:14:16.750
Good.,00:14:16.750,00:14:17.880
"All right, so I cancel these
and what I'm left with then",00:14:17.880,00:14:20.870
"is delta u times v
minus u times delta v",00:14:20.870,00:14:24.900
"and all this is over v
+ delta v times v. Okay,",00:14:24.900,00:14:32.250
there's the difference.,00:14:32.250,00:14:33.360
"There's the change
in the quotient.",00:14:33.360,00:14:36.600
"The change in this function
is given by this formula.",00:14:36.600,00:14:39.580
"And now to compute
the derivative,",00:14:39.580,00:14:41.570
"I want to divide by delta
x, and take the limit.",00:14:41.570,00:14:45.000
"So let's write that down,
delta(u/v)/delta x is this",00:14:45.000,00:14:53.560
formula here divided by delta x.,00:14:53.560,00:14:56.820
"And again, I'm going to put
the delta x under these delta u",00:14:56.820,00:15:00.986
and delta v. Okay?,00:15:00.986,00:15:02.780
"I'm gonna put delta
x in the denominator,",00:15:02.780,00:15:05.080
"but I can think of
that as dividing",00:15:05.080,00:15:07.150
"into this factor
and this factor.",00:15:07.150,00:15:09.920
"So this is (delta u/ delta
x)v - u(delta v/delta x).",00:15:09.920,00:15:16.980
"And all that is divided
by the same denominator,",00:15:21.130,00:15:23.130
(v + delta v)v. Right?,00:15:23.130,00:15:28.970
"Put the delta x up in
the numerator there.",00:15:28.970,00:15:33.010
"Next up, take the limit
as delta x goes to 0.",00:15:33.010,00:15:37.830
"I get, by definition,
the derivative of (u/v).",00:15:37.830,00:15:43.470
"And on the right
hand side, well, this",00:15:43.470,00:15:46.210
is the derivative du/dx right?,00:15:46.210,00:15:51.300
"Times v. See and then
u times, and here it's",00:15:51.300,00:15:55.570
the derivative dv/dx.,00:15:55.570,00:15:56.480
Now what about the denominator?,00:16:00.420,00:16:04.250
"So when delta x goes to 0,
v stays the same, v stays",00:16:04.250,00:16:10.220
the same.,00:16:10.220,00:16:10.720
What happens to this delta v?,00:16:10.720,00:16:13.480
"It goes to 0, again,
because v is continuous.",00:16:13.480,00:16:17.970
"So again, delta v
goes to 0 with delta x",00:16:17.970,00:16:23.330
"because they're continuous
and you just get v times v.",00:16:23.330,00:16:28.180
"I think that's the formula
I wrote down over there.",00:16:28.180,00:16:30.867
(du/dx)v - u(dv/dx).,00:16:30.867,00:16:31.700
"And all divided by the square
of the old denominator.",00:16:35.510,00:16:40.770
"Well, that's it.",00:16:40.770,00:16:42.160
That's the quotient rule.,00:16:42.160,00:16:43.540
Weird formula.,00:16:43.540,00:16:44.520
Let's see an application.,00:16:44.520,00:16:46.160
Let's see an example.,00:16:46.160,00:16:51.070
"So the example I'm going
to give is pretty simple.",00:16:51.070,00:16:54.680
"I'm going to take the
numerator to be just 1.",00:16:54.680,00:16:58.100
So I'm gonna take u = 1.,00:16:58.100,00:17:02.790
"So now I'm
differentiating 1 / v,",00:17:02.790,00:17:07.580
"the reciprocal of a
function; 1 over a function.",00:17:07.580,00:17:14.430
Here's a copy of my rule.,00:17:14.430,00:17:16.880
"What's du/ dx in that
case? u is a constant,",00:17:16.880,00:17:22.790
so that term is 0 in this rule.,00:17:22.790,00:17:27.050
"I don't have to
worry about this.",00:17:27.050,00:17:28.700
I get a minus.,00:17:28.700,00:17:31.650
"And then u is 1, and dv/dx.",00:17:31.650,00:17:36.800
"Well, v is whatever v is.",00:17:36.800,00:17:38.820
I'll write dv/dx as v'.,00:17:38.820,00:17:40.790
"And then I get a v^2
in the denominator.",00:17:43.854,00:17:45.520
So that's the rule.,00:17:45.520,00:17:50.070
I could write it as v^(-2) v'.,00:17:50.070,00:17:51.380
Minus v' divided by v^2.,00:17:56.840,00:17:59.300
That's the derivative of 1 / v.,00:17:59.300,00:18:03.730
How about sub-example of that?,00:18:03.730,00:18:12.110
"I'm going to take the special
case where u = 1 again.",00:18:12.110,00:18:15.840
And v is a power of x.,00:18:15.840,00:18:16.770
"And I'm gonna use the rule
that we developed earlier about",00:18:21.000,00:18:25.630
the derivative of x^n.,00:18:25.630,00:18:29.080
So what do I get here?,00:18:29.080,00:18:33.230
"d/dx (1/x^n) is, I'm plugging
into this formula here with v =",00:18:33.230,00:18:42.645
x^n.,00:18:42.645,00:18:45.260
"So I get minus, uh, v^-2.",00:18:45.260,00:18:51.580
"If v = x^n, v^-2 is, by the
rule of exponents, x^(-2n).",00:18:51.580,00:18:57.250
"And then v' is the derivative
of x^n, which is nx^(n-1).",00:19:01.430,00:19:05.550
"Okay, so let's put
these together.",00:19:10.150,00:19:12.010
"There's several
powers of x here.",00:19:12.010,00:19:13.550
I can put them together.,00:19:13.550,00:19:14.940
I get -n x to the -2n + n - 1.,00:19:14.940,00:19:22.330
One of these n's cancels.,00:19:22.330,00:19:23.936
"And what I'm left
with is -n - 1.",00:19:23.936,00:19:25.310
"So we've computed the
derivative of 1 / x^n,",00:19:29.260,00:19:32.550
"which I could also
write as x^-n, right?",00:19:32.550,00:19:39.210
"So I've computed the derivative
of negative powers of x.",00:19:39.210,00:19:42.640
"And this is the
formula that I get.",00:19:42.640,00:19:46.560
"If you think of this -n as a
unit, as a thing to itself,",00:19:46.560,00:19:51.990
it occurs here in the exponent.,00:19:51.990,00:19:54.310
"It occurs here,
and it occurs here.",00:19:54.310,00:19:59.890
"So how does that
compare with the formula",00:19:59.890,00:20:01.820
that we had up here?,00:20:01.820,00:20:04.120
"The derivative of
a power of x is",00:20:04.120,00:20:06.860
"that power times x to
one less than that power.",00:20:06.860,00:20:12.300
"That's exactly the same as the
rule that I wrote down here.",00:20:12.300,00:20:16.010
"But the power here happens
to be a negative number,",00:20:16.010,00:20:19.050
"and the same negative number
shows up as a coefficient",00:20:19.050,00:20:22.360
and there in the exponent.,00:20:22.360,00:20:23.780
Yeah?,00:20:23.780,00:20:24.280
Student: [INAUDIBLE].,00:20:24.280,00:20:30.440
Professor: How did I do this?,00:20:30.440,00:20:34.930
Student: [INAUDIBLE].,00:20:34.930,00:20:49.150
"Professor: Where did
that x^(-2n) come from?",00:20:49.150,00:20:55.990
So I'm applying this rule.,00:20:55.990,00:20:59.900
"So the denominator in
the quotient rule is v^2.",00:20:59.900,00:21:04.440
"And v was x^n, so the
denominator is x^(2n).",00:21:04.440,00:21:11.109
"And I decided to
write it as x^(-2n).",00:21:11.109,00:21:12.650
So the green comments there...,00:21:19.010,00:21:22.080
"What they say is that I
can enlarge this rule.",00:21:22.080,00:21:26.270
"This exact same rule is true
for negative values of n,",00:21:26.270,00:21:31.230
as well as positive values of n.,00:21:31.230,00:21:36.310
"So there's something
new in your list",00:21:36.310,00:21:40.300
"of rules that you can apply,
of values of the derivative.",00:21:40.300,00:21:46.670
"That standard rule is true for
negative as well as positive",00:21:46.670,00:21:49.550
exponents.,00:21:49.550,00:21:51.120
"And that comes out
of a quotient rule.",00:21:51.120,00:21:57.290
"Okay, so we've done two rules.",00:21:57.290,00:21:59.020
"I've talked about the product
rule and the quotient rule.",00:21:59.020,00:22:04.650
What's next?,00:22:04.650,00:22:05.670
Let's see the chain rule.,00:22:05.670,00:22:07.150
So this is a composition rule.,00:22:07.150,00:22:22.220
"So the kind of thing that
I have in mind, composition",00:22:22.220,00:22:24.890
"of functions is
about substitution.",00:22:24.890,00:22:28.210
"So the kind of function that I
have in mind is, for instance,",00:22:28.210,00:22:31.106
y = (sin t)^10.,00:22:31.106,00:22:31.730
That's a new one.,00:22:39.700,00:22:42.695
"We haven't seen how to
differentiate that before, I",00:22:42.695,00:22:44.820
think.,00:22:44.820,00:22:46.590
"This kind of power of a trig
function happens very often.",00:22:46.590,00:22:50.600
"You've seen them happen,
as well, I'm sure, already.",00:22:50.600,00:22:53.540
"And there's a little notational
switch that people use.",00:22:53.540,00:22:58.020
They'll write sin^10(t).,00:22:58.020,00:22:59.320
"But remember that when
you write sin^10(t),",00:23:02.910,00:23:05.100
"what you mean is
take the sine of t,",00:23:05.100,00:23:08.030
"and then take the
10th power of that.",00:23:08.030,00:23:10.440
It's the meaning of sin^10(t).,00:23:10.440,00:23:13.590
"So the method of dealing
with this kind of composition",00:23:13.590,00:23:20.950
"of functions is to use
new variable names.",00:23:20.950,00:23:33.190
"What I mean is, I can
think of this (sin t)^10.",00:23:33.190,00:23:36.830
"I can think of it it
as a two step process.",00:23:39.710,00:23:42.070
"First of all, I
compute the sine of t.",00:23:42.070,00:23:44.160
And let's call the result x.,00:23:44.160,00:23:47.450
There's the new variable name.,00:23:47.450,00:23:50.150
"And then, I express
y in terms of x.",00:23:50.150,00:23:53.340
"So y says take this and
raise it to the tenth power.",00:23:53.340,00:23:58.070
"In other words, y = x^10.",00:23:58.070,00:23:59.360
"And then you plug x
= sin(t) into that,",00:24:03.400,00:24:06.420
"and you get the formula for
what y is in terms of t.",00:24:06.420,00:24:10.590
"So it's good practice to
introduce new letters when",00:24:10.590,00:24:14.550
"they're convenient, and
this is one place where",00:24:14.550,00:24:17.060
it's very convenient.,00:24:17.060,00:24:21.820
"So let's find a rule
for differentiating",00:24:21.820,00:24:24.260
"a composition, a
function that can",00:24:24.260,00:24:25.860
"be expressed by
doing one function",00:24:25.860,00:24:27.770
"and then applying
another function.",00:24:27.770,00:24:30.270
And here's the rule.,00:24:30.270,00:24:32.880
"Well, maybe I'll actually
derive this rule first,",00:24:32.880,00:24:34.930
and then you'll see what it is.,00:24:34.930,00:24:37.420
"In fact, the rule is
very simple to derive.",00:24:37.420,00:24:40.600
"So this is a proof first, and
then we'll write down the rule.",00:24:40.600,00:24:43.890
"I'm interested in delta y /
delta t. y is a function of x.",00:24:43.890,00:24:51.950
x is a function of t.,00:24:51.950,00:24:53.760
"And I'm interested in how
y changes with respect",00:24:53.760,00:24:56.850
"to t, with respect to
the original variable t.",00:24:56.850,00:25:00.850
"Well, because of that
intermediate variable,",00:25:00.850,00:25:05.160
"I can write this as (delta y /
delta x) (delta x / delta t).",00:25:05.160,00:25:12.670
"It cancels, right?",00:25:12.670,00:25:15.330
The delta x cancels.,00:25:15.330,00:25:17.600
"The change in that immediate
variable cancels out.",00:25:17.600,00:25:23.100
This is just basic algebra.,00:25:23.100,00:25:26.120
"But what happens when I
let delta t get small?",00:25:26.120,00:25:29.930
Well this give me dy/dt.,00:25:29.930,00:25:31.410
"On the right-hand side,
I get (dy/dx) (dx/dt).",00:25:34.370,00:25:42.220
"So students will often
remember this rule.",00:25:42.220,00:25:44.430
"This is the rule, by saying
that you can cancel out",00:25:44.430,00:25:47.130
for the dx's.,00:25:47.130,00:25:49.080
"And that's not so
far from the truth.",00:25:49.080,00:25:51.860
"That's a good way
to think of it.",00:25:51.860,00:25:55.160
"In other words, this is
the so-called chain rule.",00:25:55.160,00:26:01.410
"And it says that differentiation
of a composition is a product.",00:26:01.410,00:26:26.690
"It's just the product
of the two derivatives.",00:26:26.690,00:26:34.910
"So that's how you differentiate
a composite of two functions.",00:26:34.910,00:26:39.570
And let's just do an example.,00:26:39.570,00:26:42.070
Let's do this example.,00:26:42.070,00:26:44.690
Let's see how that comes out.,00:26:44.690,00:26:48.820
"So let's differentiate,
what did I say?",00:26:48.820,00:26:55.250
(sin t)^10.,00:26:55.250,00:26:56.530
"Okay, there's an inside function
and an outside function.",00:26:59.400,00:27:03.130
"The inside function is
x as a function of t.",00:27:03.130,00:27:07.910
"This is the inside function, and
this is the outside function.",00:27:07.910,00:27:19.170
"So the rule says, first
of all let's differentiate",00:27:19.170,00:27:22.590
the outside function.,00:27:22.590,00:27:23.550
Take dy/dx.,00:27:23.550,00:27:25.370
"Differentiate it with
respect to that variable x.",00:27:25.370,00:27:29.200
"The outside function
is the 10th power.",00:27:29.200,00:27:31.020
What's its derivative?,00:27:31.020,00:27:34.640
So I get 10x^9.,00:27:34.640,00:27:37.530
"In this account, I'm using
this newly introduced variable",00:27:42.440,00:27:51.090
named x.,00:27:51.090,00:27:53.990
"So the derivative of the
outside function is 10x^9.",00:27:53.990,00:27:58.150
"And then here's the
inside function,",00:27:58.150,00:28:00.360
"and the next thing I want
to do is differentiate it.",00:28:00.360,00:28:03.130
"So what's dx/dt, d/dt (sin
t), the derivative of sine t?",00:28:03.130,00:28:07.730
"All right, that's cosine t.",00:28:07.730,00:28:11.619
"That's what the
chain rule gives you.",00:28:11.619,00:28:13.160
"This is correct, but
since we were the ones",00:28:13.160,00:28:17.490
"to introduce this
notation x here,",00:28:17.490,00:28:20.730
"that wasn't given to us in
the original problem here.",00:28:20.730,00:28:24.560
"The last step in
this process should",00:28:24.560,00:28:26.400
"be to put back,
to substitute back",00:28:26.400,00:28:28.980
in what x is in terms of t.,00:28:28.980,00:28:32.440
So x = sin t.,00:28:32.440,00:28:35.320
"So that tells me that I get
10(sin(t))^9, that's x^9,",00:28:35.320,00:28:45.980
times the cos(t).,00:28:45.980,00:28:47.860
"Or the same thing
is sin^9(t)cos(t).",00:28:47.860,00:28:50.860
"So there's an application
of the chain rule.",00:28:56.040,00:28:59.540
"You know, people often
wonder where the name chain",00:28:59.540,00:29:02.504
rule comes from.,00:29:02.504,00:29:03.170
"I was just wondering
about that myself.",00:29:03.170,00:29:06.340
"So is it because
it chains you down?",00:29:06.340,00:29:15.230
Is it like a chain fence?,00:29:15.230,00:29:18.070
I decided what it is.,00:29:18.070,00:29:19.590
"It's because by
using it, you burst",00:29:19.590,00:29:21.910
"the chains of differentiation,
and you can differentiate",00:29:21.910,00:29:25.880
many more functions using it.,00:29:25.880,00:29:28.040
"So when you want to
think of the chain rule,",00:29:28.040,00:29:31.553
just think of that chain there.,00:29:31.553,00:29:35.640
It lets you burst free.,00:29:35.640,00:29:47.960
"Let me give you another
application of the chain rule.",00:29:47.960,00:30:04.830
Ready for this one?,00:30:04.830,00:30:16.220
"So I'd like to
differentiate the sin(10t).",00:30:16.220,00:30:17.970
"Again, this is the
composite of two functions.",00:30:25.524,00:30:27.440
What's the inside function?,00:30:27.440,00:30:30.220
"Okay, so I think I'll introduce
this new notation. x = 10t,",00:30:30.220,00:30:35.640
"and the outside
function is the sine.",00:30:35.640,00:30:38.260
So y = sin x.,00:30:38.260,00:30:41.320
"So now the chain
rule says dy/dt is...",00:30:41.320,00:30:46.660
"Okay, let's see.",00:30:46.660,00:30:47.920
"I take the derivative
of the outside function,",00:30:47.920,00:30:50.710
and what's that?,00:30:50.710,00:30:54.240
"Sine prime and we can
substitute because we",00:30:54.240,00:30:56.470
know what sine prime is.,00:30:56.470,00:30:58.520
"So I get cosine of whatever,
x, and then times what?",00:30:58.520,00:31:06.470
"Now I differentiate the inside
function, which is just 10.",00:31:06.470,00:31:11.400
"So I could write this
as 10cos of what?",00:31:11.400,00:31:16.380
"10t, x is 10t.",00:31:16.380,00:31:17.360
"Now, once you get used to
this, this middle variable,",00:31:20.260,00:31:26.170
"you don't have to
give a name for it.",00:31:26.170,00:31:33.190
"You can just to think
about it in your mind",00:31:33.190,00:31:35.150
"without actually writing
it down, d/dt (sin(10t)).",00:31:35.150,00:31:44.890
"I'll just do it again
without introducing",00:31:47.980,00:31:49.860
this middle variable explicitly.,00:31:49.860,00:31:52.240
Think about it.,00:31:52.240,00:31:54.530
"I first of all differentiate
the outside function,",00:31:54.530,00:31:58.100
and I get cosine.,00:31:58.100,00:31:59.740
"But I don't change the thing
that I'm plugging into it.",00:31:59.740,00:32:03.170
"It's still x that I'm
plugging into it. x is 10t.",00:32:03.170,00:32:08.560
"So let's just write 10t and
not worry about the name",00:32:08.560,00:32:11.470
of that extra variable.,00:32:11.470,00:32:12.720
"If it confuses you,
introduce the new variable.",00:32:12.720,00:32:15.510
"And do it carefully
and slowly like this.",00:32:15.510,00:32:18.180
"But, quite quickly,
I think you'll",00:32:18.180,00:32:19.970
"get to be able to keep
that step in your mind.",00:32:19.970,00:32:23.202
I'm not quite done yet.,00:32:23.202,00:32:24.160
"I haven't differentiated
the inside function,",00:32:24.160,00:32:26.900
the derivative of 10t = 10.,00:32:26.900,00:32:29.190
"So you get, again,
the same result.",00:32:29.190,00:32:33.250
"A little shortcut that
you'll get used to.",00:32:33.250,00:32:36.420
"Really and truly, once
you have the chain rule,",00:32:36.420,00:32:38.680
the world is yours to conquer.,00:32:38.680,00:32:41.110
"It puts you in a very,
very powerful position.",00:32:41.110,00:32:46.730
"Okay, well let's see.",00:32:46.730,00:32:50.210
What have I covered today?,00:32:50.210,00:32:51.310
"I've talked about product rule,
quotient rule, composition.",00:32:51.310,00:32:57.370
"I should tell you something
about higher derivatives,",00:32:57.370,00:32:59.580
as well.,00:32:59.580,00:33:00.670
So let's do that.,00:33:00.670,00:33:10.440
This is a simple story.,00:33:10.440,00:33:12.150
"Higher is kind of
a strange word.",00:33:12.150,00:33:14.950
"It just means differentiate
over and over again.",00:33:14.950,00:33:32.950
"All right, so let's see.",00:33:32.950,00:33:34.600
"If we have a function
u or u(x), please",00:33:34.600,00:33:38.510
"allow me to just write
it as briefly as u.",00:33:38.510,00:33:45.010
"Well, this is a sort
of notational thing.",00:33:45.010,00:33:49.330
"I can differentiate
it and get u'.",00:33:49.330,00:33:51.780
That's a new function.,00:33:54.790,00:33:55.900
"Like if you started
with the sine, that's",00:33:55.900,00:33:57.680
gonna be the cosine.,00:33:57.680,00:34:00.760
"A new function, so I can
differentiate it again.",00:34:00.760,00:34:03.570
"And the notation for the
differentiating of it again,",00:34:03.570,00:34:05.780
is u prime prime.,00:34:05.780,00:34:07.470
"So u'' is just u'
differentiated again.",00:34:07.470,00:34:12.930
"For example, if u is the sine
of x, so u' is the cosine of x.",00:34:12.930,00:34:21.380
"Has Professor Jerison
talked about what",00:34:21.380,00:34:24.150
the derivative of cosine is?,00:34:24.150,00:34:26.580
What is it?,00:34:26.580,00:34:28.220
"Ha, okay so u'' is -sin x.",00:34:28.220,00:34:33.020
Let me go on.,00:34:36.810,00:34:38.930
What do you suppose u''' means?,00:34:38.930,00:34:42.970
"I guess it's the
derivative of u''.",00:34:42.970,00:34:46.420
"It's called the
third derivative.",00:34:46.420,00:34:53.050
"And u'' is called the
second derivative.",00:34:53.050,00:34:56.210
"And it's u''
differentiated again.",00:34:56.210,00:34:59.000
"So to compute u''' in this
example, what do I do?",00:34:59.000,00:35:03.680
I differentiate that again.,00:35:03.680,00:35:05.340
"There's a constant term,
-1, constant factor.",00:35:05.340,00:35:08.460
That comes out.,00:35:08.460,00:35:09.950
The derivative of sine is what?,00:35:09.950,00:35:13.500
"Okay, so u''' = -cos x.",00:35:13.500,00:35:17.930
Let's do it again.,00:35:17.930,00:35:18.690
"Now after a while, you get
tired of writing these things.",00:35:18.690,00:35:21.890
"And so maybe I'll use
the notation u^(4).",00:35:21.890,00:35:24.650
That's the fourth derivative.,00:35:24.650,00:35:27.290
That's u''''.,00:35:27.290,00:35:29.490
"Or it's (u''') differentiated
again, the fourth derivative.",00:35:29.490,00:35:33.440
"And what is that
in this example?",00:35:33.440,00:35:37.970
"Okay, the cosine has
derivative minus the sine,",00:35:37.970,00:35:41.290
like you told me.,00:35:41.290,00:35:42.010
"And that minus sign
cancels with that sign,",00:35:42.010,00:35:44.430
"and all together, I get sin x.",00:35:44.430,00:35:47.640
That's pretty bizarre.,00:35:47.640,00:35:48.940
"When I differentiate the
function sine of x four times,",00:35:48.940,00:35:51.720
"I get back to the
sine of x again.",00:35:51.720,00:35:56.920
That's the way it is.,00:35:56.920,00:36:00.290
"Now this notation, prime
prime prime prime, and things",00:36:00.290,00:36:03.491
like that.,00:36:03.491,00:36:03.990
"There are different
variants of that notation.",00:36:03.990,00:36:13.650
"For example, that's
another notation.",00:36:13.650,00:36:24.070
"Well, you've used the
notation du/dx before. u'",00:36:24.070,00:36:29.320
could also be denoted du/dx.,00:36:29.320,00:36:30.630
"I think we've
already here, today,",00:36:35.730,00:36:38.460
"used this way of
rewriting du/dx.",00:36:38.460,00:36:43.230
"I think when I was talking about
d/dt(uv) and so on, I pulled",00:36:43.230,00:36:48.150
"that d/dt outside and
put whatever function",00:36:48.150,00:36:52.360
"you're differentiating
over to the right.",00:36:52.360,00:36:55.010
"So that's just a
notational switch.",00:36:55.010,00:36:57.430
It looks good.,00:36:57.430,00:36:58.110
"It looks like good
algebra doesn't it?",00:36:58.110,00:37:06.260
"But what it's doing is regarding
this notation as an operator.",00:37:06.260,00:37:12.410
"It's something you apply to a
function to get a new function.",00:37:12.410,00:37:16.920
"I apply it to the sine function,
and I get the cosine function.",00:37:16.920,00:37:20.680
"I apply it to x^2, and I get 2x.",00:37:20.680,00:37:24.220
"This thing here, that symbol,
represents an operator,",00:37:24.220,00:37:31.140
which you apply to a function.,00:37:31.140,00:37:40.340
"And the operator says, take the
function and differentiate it.",00:37:40.340,00:37:44.860
"So further notation
that people often use,",00:37:44.860,00:37:47.330
"is they give a different
name to that operator.",00:37:47.330,00:37:49.460
"And they'll write
capital D for it.",00:37:49.460,00:37:52.270
"So this is just using capital
D for the symbol d/dx.",00:37:52.270,00:38:02.980
"So in terms of that
notation, let's see.",00:38:02.980,00:38:05.050
"Let's write down what higher
derivatives look like.",00:38:05.050,00:38:20.440
So let's see.,00:38:20.440,00:38:21.870
That's what u' is.,00:38:21.870,00:38:23.090
How about u''?,00:38:23.090,00:38:24.360
"Let's write that in terms
of the d/dx notation.",00:38:24.360,00:38:28.890
"Well I'm supposed to
differentiate u' right?",00:38:28.890,00:38:31.710
"So that's d/dx applied
to the function du/dx.",00:38:31.710,00:38:35.590
Differentiate the derivative.,00:38:40.920,00:38:43.030
That's what I've done.,00:38:43.030,00:38:47.240
"Or I could write that as d/dx
applied to d/dx applied to u.",00:38:47.240,00:38:54.350
Just pulling that u outside.,00:38:54.350,00:38:57.850
So I'm doing d/dx twice.,00:38:57.850,00:38:59.570
I'm doing that operator twice.,00:38:59.570,00:39:01.590
"I could write that as
(d/dx)^2 applied to u.",00:39:01.590,00:39:08.030
"Differentiate twice, and
do it to the function u.",00:39:08.030,00:39:15.170
"Or, I can write it as,
now this is a strange one.",00:39:15.170,00:39:23.130
"I could also write
as-- like that.",00:39:23.130,00:39:33.330
"It's getting stranger
and stranger, isn't it?",00:39:33.330,00:39:36.630
"This is definitely just a
kind of abuse of notation.",00:39:36.630,00:39:40.770
"But people will go even
further and write d squared",00:39:40.770,00:39:45.030
u divided by dx squared.,00:39:45.030,00:39:46.030
So this is the strangest one.,00:39:50.500,00:39:52.190
"This identity quality
is the strangest one,",00:39:52.190,00:39:56.190
"because you may think that
you're taking d of the quantity",00:39:56.190,00:40:00.130
x^2.,00:40:00.130,00:40:01.330
But that's not what's intended.,00:40:01.330,00:40:03.930
This is not d(x^2).,00:40:03.930,00:40:08.240
"What's intended is the
quantity dx squared.",00:40:08.240,00:40:12.750
"In this notation,
which is very common,",00:40:12.750,00:40:14.630
"what's intended
by the denominator",00:40:14.630,00:40:16.410
is the quantity dx squared.,00:40:16.410,00:40:18.250
"It's part of this second
differentiation operator.",00:40:18.250,00:40:23.630
"So I've written a bunch
of equalities down here,",00:40:23.630,00:40:26.240
"and the only content
to them is that these",00:40:26.240,00:40:28.570
"are all different notations
for the same thing.",00:40:28.570,00:40:32.320
"You'll see this
notation very commonly.",00:40:32.320,00:40:34.940
"So for instance the
third derivative",00:40:34.940,00:40:37.050
"is d cubed u divided
by dx cubed, and so on.",00:40:37.050,00:40:47.330
Sorry?,00:40:47.330,00:40:47.830
Student: [INAUDIBLE].,00:40:47.830,00:40:58.755
"Professor: Yes, absolutely.",00:40:58.755,00:40:59.880
"Or an equally good notation is
to write the operator capital",00:40:59.880,00:41:04.417
"D, done three times, to u.",00:41:04.417,00:41:05.500
Absolutely.,00:41:09.400,00:41:11.502
"So I guess I should also write
over here when I was talking",00:41:11.502,00:41:13.960
"about d^2, the
second derivative,",00:41:13.960,00:41:16.180
"another notation is do the
operator capital D twice.",00:41:16.180,00:41:20.820
"Let's see an example of
how this can be applied.",00:41:20.820,00:41:22.820
I'll answer this question.,00:41:22.820,00:41:23.903
Student: [INAUDIBLE].,00:41:23.903,00:41:32.582
"Professor: Yeah,
so the question is",00:41:32.582,00:41:34.040
"whether the fourth
derivative always gives you",00:41:34.040,00:41:36.230
"the original function back,
like what happened here.",00:41:36.230,00:41:38.880
No.,00:41:38.880,00:41:39.580
"That's very, very special
to sines and cosines.",00:41:39.580,00:41:43.470
All right?,00:41:43.470,00:41:45.200
"And, in fact, let's
see an example of that.",00:41:45.200,00:41:47.850
I'll do a calculation.,00:41:47.850,00:41:50.920
"Let's calculate the
nth derivative of x^n.",00:41:50.920,00:42:06.130
"Okay, n is a number,
like 1, 2, 3, 4.",00:42:06.130,00:42:13.190
Here we go.,00:42:13.190,00:42:13.720
Let's do this.,00:42:13.720,00:42:15.360
"So, let's do this bit by bit.",00:42:15.360,00:42:17.650
"What's the first
derivative of x^n?",00:42:17.650,00:42:22.500
So everybody knows this.,00:42:22.500,00:42:24.090
"I'm just using a new notation,
this capital D notation.",00:42:24.090,00:42:27.830
So it's nx^(n-1).,00:42:27.830,00:42:30.520
"Now know, by the way, n could
be a negative number for that,",00:42:30.520,00:42:34.380
"but for now, for
this application,",00:42:34.380,00:42:37.250
"I wanna take n to be
1, 2, 3, and so on;",00:42:37.250,00:42:41.280
one of those numbers.,00:42:41.280,00:42:43.070
"Okay, we did one derivative.",00:42:43.070,00:42:44.550
"Let's compute the second
derivative of x^n.",00:42:44.550,00:42:49.530
"Well there's this n
constant that comes out,",00:42:49.530,00:42:52.070
"and then the exponent comes
down, and it gets reduced by 1.",00:42:52.070,00:42:59.980
All right?,00:42:59.980,00:43:01.190
Should I do one more?,00:43:01.190,00:43:03.780
D^3 (x^n) is n(n-1).,00:43:03.780,00:43:07.600
That's the constant from here.,00:43:07.600,00:43:09.410
"Times that exponent,
n - 2, times 1 less, n",00:43:09.410,00:43:13.220
- 3 is the new exponent.,00:43:13.220,00:43:15.740
"Well, I keep on going until
I come to a new blackboard.",00:43:15.740,00:43:26.430
"Now, I think I'm
going to stop when",00:43:26.430,00:43:28.100
"I get to the n minus
first derivative,",00:43:28.100,00:43:29.980
"so we can see what's
likely to happen.",00:43:29.980,00:43:35.370
"So when I took the
third derivative,",00:43:35.370,00:43:38.970
"I had the n minus
third power of x.",00:43:38.970,00:43:42.957
"And when I took the
second derivative,",00:43:42.957,00:43:44.540
I had the second power of x.,00:43:44.540,00:43:45.760
"So, I think what'll
happen when I",00:43:45.760,00:43:48.310
"have the n minus
first derivative",00:43:48.310,00:43:49.730
"is I'll have the first
power of x left over.",00:43:49.730,00:43:53.510
"The powers of x
keep coming down.",00:43:53.510,00:43:55.390
"And what I've done it n - 1
times, I get the first power.",00:43:55.390,00:43:59.350
"And then I get a big constant
out in front here times more",00:43:59.350,00:44:04.230
"and more and more of these
smaller and smaller integers",00:44:04.230,00:44:07.450
that come down.,00:44:07.450,00:44:08.500
"What's the last integer that
came down before I got x^1",00:44:08.500,00:44:12.310
here?,00:44:12.310,00:44:17.460
"Well, let's see.",00:44:17.460,00:44:19.390
"It's just 2, because this x^1
occurred as the derivative",00:44:19.390,00:44:23.320
of x^2.,00:44:23.320,00:44:24.340
"And the coefficient
in front of that is 2.",00:44:24.340,00:44:27.800
So that's what you get.,00:44:27.800,00:44:29.730
"The numbers n, n-1, and so
on down to 2, times x^1.",00:44:29.730,00:44:35.140
"And now we can differentiate
one more time and calculate what",00:44:35.140,00:44:41.560
D^n x^n is.,00:44:41.560,00:44:42.770
"So I get the same number, n
times n-1 and so on and so on,",00:44:42.770,00:44:48.070
times 2.,00:44:48.070,00:44:49.680
"And then I guess
I'll say times 1.",00:44:49.680,00:44:52.500
"Times, what's the derivative
of x^1= 1, so times 1.",00:44:52.500,00:44:58.640
"Time 1, times 1.",00:44:58.640,00:45:01.260
"Where this one means
the constant function 1.",00:45:01.260,00:45:10.490
"Does anyone know what
this number is called?",00:45:10.490,00:45:14.070
That has a name.,00:45:14.070,00:45:15.110
It's called n factorial.,00:45:15.110,00:45:19.720
"And it's written n
exclamation point.",00:45:19.720,00:45:21.400
"And we just used an example
of mathematical induction.",00:45:24.240,00:45:28.830
"So the end result is
D^n x^n is n!, constant.",00:45:28.830,00:45:37.750
Okay that's a neat fact.,00:45:37.750,00:45:42.460
"Final question for the lecture
is what's D^(n + 1) applied",00:45:42.460,00:45:47.570
to x^n?,00:45:47.570,00:45:49.730
Ha.,00:45:49.730,00:45:50.850
Excellent.,00:45:50.850,00:45:54.340
"It's the derivative
of a constant.",00:45:54.340,00:45:56.620
So it's 0.,00:45:56.620,00:45:57.940
Okay.,00:45:57.940,00:45:58.440
Thank you.,00:45:58.440,00:45:59.980
