"PROFESSOR: Today, we are going
to do computational complexity.",00:00:22.720,00:00:26.270
"This is rather different
from every other thing",00:00:26.270,00:00:28.989
we've seen in this class.,00:00:28.989,00:00:30.030
"This class is basically about
polynomial time algorithms",00:00:32.729,00:00:36.120
"and problems where we
can solve your problem",00:00:36.120,00:00:38.580
in polynomial time.,00:00:38.580,00:00:40.290

when you can't do that.",00:00:40.290,00:00:43.130

you can't do that.",00:00:43.130,00:00:44.880
"Sometimes, we're pretty
sure you can't do that.",00:00:44.880,00:00:47.020

negative results",00:00:47.020,00:00:49.140
"when your problems
are really complex.",00:00:49.140,00:00:52.850

of fun topics, here.",00:00:52.850,00:00:55.040
"This is the topic of
entire classes, like 6045.",00:00:55.040,00:00:59.280
"We're just going to get
a 1 hour flavor of it.",00:00:59.280,00:01:02.950
"So think of it as
a high level intro.",00:01:02.950,00:01:04.519
"But we're going to prove real
theorems and do real things",00:01:04.519,00:01:06.893
"and you'll get a sense
of how all this works.",00:01:06.893,00:01:09.580
"So I'm going to start out with
three complexity classes--",00:01:09.580,00:01:13.680
"P, EXP, and R. How many
people know what P is?",00:01:13.680,00:01:21.390
And it is?,00:01:21.390,00:01:23.760
Polynomial time.,00:01:23.760,00:01:25.990
"More precisely, it's
the set of all problems",00:01:25.990,00:01:28.510
"you can solve in
polynomial time.",00:01:28.510,00:01:30.060
"This is what the
class is all about.",00:01:35.590,00:01:37.090
"Almost every
problem we have seen",00:01:39.736,00:01:41.110
"in this class-- there's
one exception-- is",00:01:41.110,00:01:44.410
"in P. Does anyone
know the exception?",00:01:44.410,00:01:48.960
It's a good puzzle for you.,00:01:48.960,00:01:51.150
Not NP.,00:01:51.150,00:01:51.940
What's next?,00:01:51.940,00:01:52.440
EXP.,00:01:52.440,00:01:55.120
"How many people
know what EXP is?",00:01:55.120,00:01:56.660
Or you can guess.,00:01:56.660,00:01:58.810
Any guesses?,00:01:58.810,00:02:00.400
Exponential.,00:02:00.400,00:02:01.569
"These are all the problems you
can solve in exponential time.",00:02:01.569,00:02:04.110
"If you want to be formal
about it, in this case,",00:02:21.190,00:02:23.210
"exponential means 2 to
the n to some constant.",00:02:23.210,00:02:29.200
"So not just 2 the n, but also
2 to the n squared, 2 to the n",00:02:29.200,00:02:31.700
cubed.,00:02:31.700,00:02:32.199
"Those are all
considered-- exponential",00:02:32.199,00:02:34.350
"and a polynomial is
considered in the class EXP.",00:02:34.350,00:02:38.050
"Now, basically, almost every
problem you can dream of you",00:02:38.050,00:02:42.010
can solve in EXP.,00:02:42.010,00:02:43.170
"Exponential time
is so much time.",00:02:43.170,00:02:45.370
"And this class has always
been about taking things that",00:02:45.370,00:02:47.705
"are obviously in EXP and showing
that they're actually in P.",00:02:47.705,00:02:51.460
"So if you want to
draw a picture,",00:02:51.460,00:02:53.120
"you could say, OK,
here's all the problems",00:02:53.120,00:02:54.870
we can solve in polynomial time.,00:02:54.870,00:02:57.070
"Here's all the problems we
can solve in exponential time.",00:02:57.070,00:03:00.287
And there are problems out here.,00:03:00.287,00:03:01.620
These are different classes.,00:03:01.620,00:03:03.390
"And we want to sort
of bring things",00:03:03.390,00:03:06.070
into here as much as possible.,00:03:06.070,00:03:09.620
"I actually want to
draw this picture",00:03:09.620,00:03:11.940
"in a different way, which
is as a horizontal line.",00:03:11.940,00:03:16.050
So an axis.,00:03:20.760,00:03:21.715
"I'm going to call this
computational difficulty.",00:03:24.860,00:03:27.949
"You could call it
computational complexity,",00:03:27.949,00:03:29.740
"but that's a bit of
a loaded term that",00:03:29.740,00:03:30.930
actually has formal meaning.,00:03:30.930,00:03:32.470
Difficulty is nice and vague.,00:03:32.470,00:03:34.000
"So I can draw an
abstract picture.",00:03:34.000,00:03:36.040
"This is not a true
diagram, but it's",00:03:36.040,00:03:38.460
"a very good guideline
of what's going on.",00:03:38.460,00:03:40.770
"So we have-- I'm going to draw--
I believe-- three notches.",00:03:40.770,00:03:46.905
"No, eventually four, so let
me give myself some room.",00:03:50.200,00:03:52.770
"We have over here, the
easy problems are P. Then,",00:03:56.480,00:04:01.920
"we have these problems,
which are EXP.",00:04:01.920,00:04:05.180
"We're going to fill in
something in the middle.",00:04:05.180,00:04:08.930
"And then this is
something called R.",00:04:08.930,00:04:11.910
"So you've got P is
everything, here.",00:04:11.910,00:04:13.410
"EXP is all the way out to
here, in some abstract view.",00:04:13.410,00:04:19.140
"The next thing is R. How
many people know what R is?",00:04:19.140,00:04:23.290
"This one, I had to look up.",00:04:23.290,00:04:26.250
It's not usually given a name.,00:04:26.250,00:04:29.780
No one.,00:04:29.780,00:04:30.805
Teaching staff?,00:04:30.805,00:04:31.430
You guys know it?,00:04:31.430,00:04:32.445
"These are all problems
solvable in finite time.",00:04:36.500,00:04:39.900
R stands for finite.,00:04:39.900,00:04:40.910
R stands for recursive.,00:04:49.980,00:04:52.280
"Recursive used to mean
something completely different,",00:04:52.280,00:04:54.530
"back in the '30s, when people
were thinking about what's",00:04:54.530,00:04:56.863
"computable, what's
not computable.",00:04:56.863,00:04:58.470
"These are, basically, solvable
problems, computable problems.",00:04:58.470,00:05:02.390
"Finite time is a reasonable
requirement, I think,",00:05:02.390,00:05:04.890
for all algorithms.,00:05:04.890,00:05:06.105
"And that's R. Now,
I've drawn this arrow",00:05:06.105,00:05:09.690
"to keep going because there
are problems out here.",00:05:09.690,00:05:13.106
"It's kind of
discouraging, but there",00:05:13.106,00:05:14.605
"are problems that
are unsolvable.",00:05:14.605,00:05:17.080
"In fact, most problems
are unsolvable.",00:05:17.080,00:05:19.977
We're going to prove that.,00:05:19.977,00:05:21.060
"It's actually really
easy to prove.",00:05:21.060,00:05:23.340
"Kind of depressing, but true.",00:05:23.340,00:05:28.360
"Let me start with some examples
before we get to that proof.",00:05:28.360,00:05:31.820
"So I'm writing examples
of some things we've seen.",00:05:36.200,00:05:40.730
"So here's an example of
a problem we've seen.",00:05:40.730,00:05:44.170
Negative-weight cycle detection.,00:05:47.740,00:05:49.095
"I give you a graph--
a weighted graph.",00:05:52.314,00:05:54.440
"I want to know does it have
any negative-weight cycles?",00:05:54.440,00:05:58.090
What classes is this problem in?,00:05:58.090,00:06:00.560
"P. We know how to solve
this in polynomial time--",00:06:00.560,00:06:03.050
in VE time-- using Bellman-Ford.,00:06:03.050,00:06:06.260
"VE time-- well, that finds
negative-weight cycles",00:06:06.260,00:06:08.650
reachable from s.,00:06:08.650,00:06:09.540
"But, I guess, if you
add a source that",00:06:09.540,00:06:11.370
"can reach anywhere--
zero weight-- then",00:06:11.370,00:06:14.390
"that'll tell you
overall that it's in P.",00:06:14.390,00:06:18.390
"It's also in EXP, of course.",00:06:18.390,00:06:19.640
Everything in P is also in EXP.,00:06:19.640,00:06:21.322
"Because if you can solve
it in polynomial time,",00:06:21.322,00:06:23.280
"you can solve it in
exponential time.",00:06:23.280,00:06:25.290
"This is at most
exponential time.",00:06:25.290,00:06:29.230
At most polynomial.,00:06:29.230,00:06:30.048
"Here's a problem
we haven't seen.",00:06:33.440,00:06:35.680
But it's pretty cool.,00:06:35.680,00:06:37.160
N by n Chess.,00:06:37.160,00:06:39.190
"So this is the
problem I give you.",00:06:39.190,00:06:41.320
"So we're in an by n
board, and I give you",00:06:41.320,00:06:43.440
"a whole bunch of
pieces on the board,",00:06:43.440,00:06:45.690
"and I want to know does
White win from here?",00:06:45.690,00:06:48.890
"I say it's White to
move or Black to move,",00:06:48.890,00:06:51.660
"and who's going to win
form this position?",00:06:51.660,00:06:55.250
"This problem, can be
solved in exponential time.",00:06:55.250,00:06:59.085
"You can sort of play out
all possible strategies",00:06:59.085,00:07:02.080
and see who wins.,00:07:02.080,00:07:05.210
"And it's not in P. There's
no polynomial time algorithm",00:07:05.210,00:07:10.060
to play generalized Chess.,00:07:10.060,00:07:12.150
"This sort of captures why
Chess-- even at eight by eight",00:07:12.150,00:07:15.250
"Chess-- is hard-- because
there's no general way",00:07:15.250,00:07:17.510
to do it.,00:07:17.510,00:07:19.220
"So there's no special
way to do it, probably.",00:07:19.220,00:07:23.210
"Computational complexity is
all about order of growth.",00:07:23.210,00:07:25.780
"So we can't analyze
eight by eight Chess,",00:07:25.780,00:07:27.770
but we can analyze n by n Chess.,00:07:27.770,00:07:29.290
"And that gives us a flavor of
why 8 by 8 is so difficult.",00:07:29.290,00:07:32.290
"Go is also in EXP, but
not in P-- lots of games",00:07:32.290,00:07:37.000
"are in this category, lot's of
complicated games, let's say.",00:07:37.000,00:07:41.430
"And so this is a first example
of a problem that we know we",00:07:41.430,00:07:45.130
cannot solve in polynomial time.,00:07:45.130,00:07:48.930
Bad news.,00:07:48.930,00:07:50.880
"I also talked about
Tetris a little bit.",00:07:50.880,00:07:53.070
"Unlike the Tetris
training, which we saw,",00:07:56.940,00:07:58.920
"this is sort of
realistic Tetris--",00:07:58.920,00:08:00.630
all the rules of Tetris.,00:08:00.630,00:08:02.340
"The only catch is that I
tell you all the pieces that",00:08:02.340,00:08:04.990
are going to come in advance.,00:08:04.990,00:08:06.470
"Because, otherwise,
it's some random process",00:08:06.470,00:08:08.442
"and it's kind of hard to think
about what's the best strategy.",00:08:08.442,00:08:11.025
"But if I tell you
what's going to come--",00:08:11.025,00:08:13.524
"say it's a
pseudo-random generator",00:08:13.524,00:08:14.940
and you know how it works.,00:08:14.940,00:08:16.365
"You know all the
pieces that will come.",00:08:16.365,00:08:17.990
"I want to know can I survive
from a given initial board mess",00:08:17.990,00:08:22.830
"and for a given
sequence of pieces.",00:08:22.830,00:08:24.980
"This can also be solved
in exponential time.",00:08:24.980,00:08:27.740
Just try all the possibilities.,00:08:27.740,00:08:29.575
"We don't know whether it's
in P. We're pretty sure",00:08:34.780,00:08:45.760
"it's not in P. And by the
end of today's lecture,",00:08:45.760,00:08:47.920
"you'll understand why
we think it's not in P.",00:08:47.920,00:08:51.500
"But it's going to be
somewhere in between here.",00:08:51.500,00:08:54.930
Tetris is actually right here.,00:08:54.930,00:08:57.110
"But I haven't defined
what right here is yet.",00:08:57.110,00:08:59.410
"And then the next one
is halting problem.",00:09:06.040,00:09:10.460
"So halting problem
is particularly cool,",00:09:24.720,00:09:27.140
as we'll see-- or interesting.,00:09:27.140,00:09:29.320
"It's the problem of given a
computer program-- Python,",00:09:29.320,00:09:34.710
"whatever, it doesn't really
matter what language.",00:09:34.710,00:09:37.540
"They're all the same in
a theoretical sense--",00:09:37.540,00:09:42.150
does it ever halt?,00:09:42.150,00:09:43.005
"Does it ever stop running,
return a result, whatever?",00:09:46.680,00:09:50.335
"This would be really handy--
you're writing some code,",00:09:53.070,00:09:55.600
"and you've run it
for 5 hours, and you",00:09:55.600,00:09:58.360
"don't know is that
because there's a bug",00:09:58.360,00:10:00.120
and you've got an infinite loop?,00:10:00.120,00:10:01.453
"Or is it just because
it's really slow?",00:10:01.453,00:10:04.000
"So you'd like to give it
to some program-- checking",00:10:04.000,00:10:08.137
"program-- that says
will this run forever",00:10:08.137,00:10:09.845
or will it terminate.,00:10:09.845,00:10:11.532
That's the halting problem.,00:10:11.532,00:10:13.160
"And this problem
is not in R. There",00:10:13.160,00:10:17.080
"is no correct algorithm
for solving this problem.",00:10:17.080,00:10:20.260
"There's no way to tell,
given an arbitrary program,",00:10:20.260,00:10:24.270
whether it will halt.,00:10:24.270,00:10:25.840
"Now, in some situations--
take the empty program--",00:10:25.840,00:10:28.130
I can tell that it halts.,00:10:28.130,00:10:29.630
"Or I take some special
simple class of programs,",00:10:29.630,00:10:33.580
"I can tell whether they halt or
determine that they don't halt.",00:10:33.580,00:10:36.890

I can solve it.",00:10:42.380,00:10:44.330

"Given finite time, there's
no way to solve this.",00:10:48.340,00:10:50.340
"And so this is a little bit
beyond what we can prove today.",00:10:50.340,00:10:53.370
"It's not that hard
to prove, but it",00:10:53.370,00:10:54.930
takes half an hour or something.,00:10:54.930,00:10:56.440
I want to get to other things.,00:10:56.440,00:10:57.690
"But if you take 6045,
they'll prove this.",00:10:57.690,00:11:02.020
"What I want to show you
instead is an easier",00:11:02.020,00:11:03.990

every problem is not in R.",00:11:03.990,00:11:29.800
"I need one term, though,
which is decision problems.",00:11:29.800,00:11:32.680
"All of these problems,
I set it up in a way",00:11:32.680,00:11:35.050
"that the answer is
binary-- yes or no.",00:11:35.050,00:11:37.556
"Is there a
negative-weight cycle?",00:11:37.556,00:11:38.930
Yes or no?,00:11:38.930,00:11:41.090
"Does White win from
this position in Chess?",00:11:41.090,00:11:43.950
Can you survive in Tetris?,00:11:43.950,00:11:46.000
And does this program halt?,00:11:46.000,00:11:48.240
"For various reasons--
basically convenience--",00:11:48.240,00:11:51.430
"the whole field of
computational complexity",00:11:51.430,00:11:53.320
focuses on decision problems.,00:11:53.320,00:11:56.550
"And, in fact-- so
decision problems",00:11:56.550,00:11:59.370
"are ones where the
answer is yes or no.",00:11:59.370,00:12:01.080
That's all.,00:12:01.080,00:12:02.920
Why?,00:12:02.920,00:12:03.880
"Essentially because
it doesn't matter.",00:12:03.880,00:12:05.520
"If you take a problem
you care about,",00:12:05.520,00:12:07.920
"you can convert it into
a decision problem.",00:12:07.920,00:12:10.200
"We can see examples
of that later.",00:12:10.200,00:12:12.760
"Decision problems
are basically as",00:12:12.760,00:12:14.290
"hard as optimization
problems or whatever.",00:12:14.290,00:12:17.989
"But let's focus on
decision problems.",00:12:17.989,00:12:19.530
The answer is yes or no.,00:12:19.530,00:12:20.920
"Claim that most of
them are uncomputable.",00:12:20.920,00:12:23.590
"And we can prove
this pretty easily",00:12:23.590,00:12:26.100
"if you know a bit of
set theory, I guess.",00:12:26.100,00:12:30.390
"On the one hand, I have
problems I want to solve.",00:12:35.309,00:12:37.350
These are decision problems.,00:12:37.350,00:12:38.520
"And on the other hand,
I have algorithms,",00:12:38.520,00:12:41.220
"or computer programs
to solve them.",00:12:41.220,00:12:42.820
"I'm going to think
of computer programs",00:12:42.820,00:12:44.445
"because more precise
algorithms can",00:12:44.445,00:12:46.640
"be a little bit nebulous for
thinking about pseudocode--",00:12:46.640,00:12:50.230
"what's valid, what's invalid.",00:12:50.230,00:12:51.460
"But computer programs
are very clear.",00:12:51.460,00:12:53.610
I give you some code.,00:12:53.610,00:12:55.049
You throw it into Python.,00:12:55.049,00:12:56.090
Either it works or it doesn't.,00:12:56.090,00:12:57.500
And it does something.,00:12:57.500,00:12:59.552
Runs for a while.,00:12:59.552,00:13:00.260
"How can I think about the
space of all possible programs?",00:13:04.080,00:13:08.750
"Well, programs are things
you type into a computer",00:13:08.750,00:13:12.020
"in ASCII, whatever.",00:13:12.020,00:13:13.400
"In the end, you can think of
it as just as a binary string.",00:13:13.400,00:13:16.380
"Somehow it gets
encoded in binary.",00:13:16.380,00:13:18.060
"Everything is reduced to binary
in the end, on a computer.",00:13:18.060,00:13:21.870
So this is a binary string.,00:13:21.870,00:13:27.340
"Now, you can also think
of a binary string",00:13:27.340,00:13:29.430
"as representing a
number, in binary.",00:13:29.430,00:13:33.280
"So you can also
think of a program,",00:13:33.280,00:13:34.870
"then, as a natural number-- some
number between 0 and infinity.",00:13:34.870,00:13:38.960
And an integer.,00:13:38.960,00:13:41.870
"So usually we represent
this as math bold N.",00:13:41.870,00:13:45.850
"That's just 0, 1, 2, 3.",00:13:45.850,00:13:48.470
"You can think of every
program is ultimately",00:13:48.470,00:13:50.670
reducing to an integer.,00:13:50.670,00:13:51.960
"It's a big integer, but, hey.",00:13:51.960,00:13:53.615
It's an integer.,00:13:53.615,00:13:55.770
"So that's the space
of all programs.",00:13:55.770,00:13:57.647
"Now, I want to think about the
space of all decision problems.",00:13:57.647,00:14:00.230
"So how can I define
a decision problem?",00:14:02.900,00:14:06.474
"Well, the natural way to
think of a decision problem",00:14:06.474,00:14:08.640
"is as a function that
maps inputs to yes or no.",00:14:08.640,00:14:12.650
"Function from
inputs to yes or no.",00:14:19.350,00:14:28.430
"Or you can think
of that as 1 and 0.",00:14:28.430,00:14:32.310
So what's an input?,00:14:32.310,00:14:34.310
"Well, an input is
a binary string.",00:14:34.310,00:14:36.220
"So an input is a number--
a natural number.",00:14:36.220,00:14:39.000
"Input is a binary string, which
we can think of as being in N.",00:14:41.790,00:14:51.580
"So we've got a
function from N to 0,1.",00:14:51.580,00:14:58.570
"So another way to represent
one of these functions",00:14:58.570,00:15:03.000
is as a table.,00:15:03.000,00:15:04.220
"I could just write
down all the answers.",00:15:04.220,00:15:06.070
"So I've got, well, the input
could be 0-- the number 0.",00:15:06.070,00:15:10.110
"And then, maybe it's a 0.",00:15:10.110,00:15:11.969
"Input could be could be 1
and then, maybe, output is 0.",00:15:11.969,00:15:14.260
"Then, the input could be 2,
3, 4, 5, 1, 0, 1, 1, whatever.",00:15:14.260,00:15:21.750
"So I could write the
table of all answers.",00:15:21.750,00:15:24.510
"This is another way to
write down such a function.",00:15:24.510,00:15:28.430
"What we have, here, is an
infinite string of bits.",00:15:28.430,00:15:32.110
Each of them could be 0 or 1.,00:15:32.110,00:15:34.290
It would be a different problem.,00:15:34.290,00:15:36.810
But they all exist.,00:15:36.810,00:15:37.850
"Any infinite string of bits
represents a decision problem.",00:15:37.850,00:15:41.060
They're the same thing.,00:15:41.060,00:15:42.750
"So a decision problem is
an infinite string of bits.",00:15:42.750,00:15:45.950
"A program is a finite
string of bits.",00:15:45.950,00:15:49.676
These are different things.,00:15:49.676,00:15:52.260
"One way to see that
they're different",00:15:52.260,00:15:54.170
"is put a decimal point, here.",00:15:54.170,00:15:57.640
"Now, this infinite
string of bits",00:15:57.640,00:15:59.630
"is a number-- a real
number-- between 0 and 1.",00:15:59.630,00:16:03.710
It's written in binary.,00:16:03.710,00:16:04.720
"You may not be used
to binary point.",00:16:04.720,00:16:07.627
This dot is not a decimal point.,00:16:07.627,00:16:08.960
It's a binary point.,00:16:08.960,00:16:10.180
"But, hey.",00:16:10.180,00:16:12.970
"Any real number can be expressed
by an infinite string of bits",00:16:12.970,00:16:16.040
"in this way-- any real
number between 0 and 1.",00:16:16.040,00:16:18.820
"So a decision
problem is basically",00:16:22.210,00:16:31.940
"something in R, the set
of all real numbers,",00:16:31.940,00:16:35.260
"whereas a program is something
in N, the set of all integers.",00:16:35.260,00:16:38.555
"And the thing is, the
number of real numbers",00:16:41.750,00:16:45.360
"is much, much bigger than
the number of integers.",00:16:45.360,00:16:50.460
"In a formal sense, we call
this one uncountably infinite,",00:16:50.460,00:16:53.110
"and this one is
countably infinite.",00:16:53.110,00:16:55.060
"I'm not going to prove
that here, today.",00:16:55.060,00:16:56.830
You may have seen that proof.,00:16:56.830,00:16:59.010
It's pretty simple.,00:16:59.010,00:17:01.320
And that's bad news.,00:17:01.320,00:17:02.350
"That means that there
are way more problems",00:17:02.350,00:17:04.829
"than there are
programs to solve them.",00:17:04.829,00:17:07.550
"So this means almost every
problem that we could conceive",00:17:07.550,00:17:12.890
"of is unsolvable
by every program.",00:17:12.890,00:17:16.525
"And this is pretty depressing
the first time I saw it.",00:17:30.600,00:17:33.245
"That's why we put it at
the end of the class.",00:17:33.245,00:17:35.120
I think you get all existential.,00:17:37.950,00:17:40.160
"I mean the thing is
every program only",00:17:40.160,00:17:42.040
solves one problem.,00:17:42.040,00:17:43.201
"It takes some input,
and it's either",00:17:43.201,00:17:44.700
going to output yes or no.,00:17:44.700,00:17:46.247
"And if it's wrong on any of
the inputs, then it's wrong.",00:17:46.247,00:17:48.580
So it's going to give an answer.,00:17:48.580,00:17:51.010
"Say it's a
deterministic algorithm.",00:17:51.010,00:17:52.570
No random numbers or things.,00:17:52.570,00:17:55.950
"Then, there's just
not enough programs",00:17:55.950,00:17:57.670
"to go around if each program
only solves one problem.",00:17:57.670,00:18:01.402
This is the end of the proof.,00:18:01.402,00:18:02.610
Any questions about that?,00:18:02.610,00:18:05.110
Kind of weird.,00:18:05.110,00:18:07.390
"Because yet somehow, most of
the problems that we think about",00:18:07.390,00:18:10.390
are computable.,00:18:10.390,00:18:11.530
I don't know why that is.,00:18:11.530,00:18:13.100
"But mathematically,
most problems",00:18:13.100,00:18:15.520
"that you could think
of are uncomputable.",00:18:15.520,00:18:17.425
Question?,00:18:21.450,00:18:22.974
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:18:22.974,00:18:23.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:18:27.850,00:18:28.750
"It's something like,
the way that we describe",00:18:28.750,00:18:32.270
"problems is usually almost
algorithmic, anyway.",00:18:32.270,00:18:35.990
"And so, usually, most problems
we think of are in EXP.",00:18:35.990,00:18:39.610
"And so they're
definitely computable.",00:18:39.610,00:18:42.300
"There's some
metatheorem about how",00:18:42.300,00:18:43.820
"we think about problems,
not just programs.",00:18:43.820,00:18:46.385
"So that's all I'm going to
say about R. So out here,",00:18:51.110,00:18:53.970
"we have halting problem and,
actually, most problems.",00:18:53.970,00:18:57.972
"You can think of this
as an infinite line",00:18:57.972,00:18:59.680
"and then there's just
this small portion",00:18:59.680,00:19:01.980
which are things you can solve.,00:19:01.980,00:19:03.840
"But we care about this
portion because that's",00:19:03.840,00:19:05.880
the interesting stuff.,00:19:05.880,00:19:07.040
"That's what
algorithms are about.",00:19:07.040,00:19:08.750
"Out here kind of
nothing happens.",00:19:08.750,00:19:13.560
"So I want to talk about
this notch, which is NP.",00:19:13.560,00:19:17.070
I imagine you've heard about NP.,00:19:22.747,00:19:24.080
"It's pretty cool, but
also kind of confusing.",00:19:27.252,00:19:30.240
"But it's actually very
closely related to something",00:19:34.616,00:19:37.890
"we've seen with dynamic
programming, which is guessing.",00:19:37.890,00:19:42.320
"So I'm going to give you
a couple of definitions",00:19:42.320,00:19:44.460
"of NP-- not formal definition,
but high level definitions.",00:19:44.460,00:19:48.285
"So just like P, EXP, and R,
it's a set of decision problems.",00:19:52.210,00:19:57.350
"And it's going to look very
similar to P. NP does not",00:19:57.350,00:20:03.650
stand for not a polynomial.,00:20:03.650,00:20:05.640
"It stands for
nondeterministic polynomial.",00:20:05.640,00:20:08.750
"We'll get to
nondeterministic in a moment.",00:20:08.750,00:20:12.330
The first line is the same.,00:20:12.330,00:20:14.436
"It's all decision problems you
can solve in polynomial time.",00:20:14.436,00:20:17.740
"That sounds like P.
But then, there's",00:20:17.740,00:20:19.720
"this extra line, which is
via a ""lucky"" algorithm.",00:20:19.720,00:20:25.480
"Let me tell you--
at a high level what",00:20:33.730,00:20:36.840
"a lucky algorithm does
is it can make guesses.",00:20:36.840,00:20:40.434
"But unlike the way that
we've been making guesses",00:20:40.434,00:20:42.475
"with dynamic programming--
with dynamic programming",00:20:42.475,00:20:44.360
we had to guess something.,00:20:44.360,00:20:45.443
We tried all the possibilities.,00:20:45.443,00:20:47.190
"A lucky algorithm just
needs to try one possibility",00:20:47.190,00:20:50.597
because it's really lucky.,00:20:50.597,00:20:51.680
"It always guesses
the right choice.",00:20:51.680,00:20:54.860
It's like magic.,00:20:54.860,00:20:56.440
"This is not a realistic
model of computation,",00:20:56.440,00:20:59.310
"but it is a model of computation
called nondeterministic model.",00:20:59.310,00:21:04.470
"And it's going to sound
crazy because it is crazy,",00:21:09.040,00:21:11.950
"but nonetheless it's
actually really useful--",00:21:11.950,00:21:15.080
"even though you could
never really build",00:21:15.080,00:21:17.410
this on a real computer.,00:21:17.410,00:21:19.576
"The nondeterministic
model is not",00:21:19.576,00:21:20.950
a model of real computation.,00:21:20.950,00:21:22.116
"It is a model of theoretical
hypothetical computation.",00:21:22.116,00:21:25.410
"It gets at the
root-- at the core",00:21:25.410,00:21:27.300
of what is possible to solve.,00:21:27.300,00:21:29.730
"You'll see why, in a little bit.",00:21:29.730,00:21:32.800
"So in this model, an algorithm--
it can compute stuff,",00:21:32.800,00:21:39.800
"but, in particular,
it makes guesses.",00:21:39.800,00:21:43.682
"So should I do this
or should I do this?",00:21:43.682,00:21:46.030
"And it just says-- It
doesn't flip a coin.",00:21:46.030,00:21:48.790
It's not random.,00:21:48.790,00:21:50.010
"It just thinks-- it
just makes a guess.",00:21:50.010,00:21:53.990
"Well, I don't know.",00:21:53.990,00:21:54.800
Let's go this way.,00:21:54.800,00:21:56.390
"And then it comes
another fork in the road.",00:21:56.390,00:21:58.182
"It's like, well, I don't know.",00:21:58.182,00:21:59.431
I'll go this way.,00:21:59.431,00:22:00.410
That's the guessing.,00:22:00.410,00:22:01.660
"You give it a list of
choices and somehow a choice",00:22:01.660,00:22:04.160
"is determined, by magic--
nondeterministic magic.",00:22:04.160,00:22:08.910
"And then the fun part is--
I should say, at the end",00:22:08.910,00:22:18.970
"the algorithm either
says yes or no.",00:22:18.970,00:22:24.652
It gives you an output.,00:22:24.652,00:22:25.610
"The guesses are guaranteed--
this is the magic part--",00:22:28.420,00:22:34.590
"to lead to a yes
answer, if possible.",00:22:34.590,00:22:43.780
"So if you imagine the space
of executions of this program,",00:22:47.650,00:22:50.800
"you start here, and you
make some guess and you",00:22:50.800,00:22:53.342
don't know which way to go.,00:22:53.342,00:22:55.190
"In dynamic programming,
we try all of them.",00:22:55.190,00:22:57.119
"But this algorithm
doesn't try all of them.",00:22:57.119,00:22:58.910
"It's like a branching universe
model of the universe.",00:22:58.910,00:23:01.580
"So you make some
choice, and then you",00:23:01.580,00:23:03.930
"make some other choice, and
then you make some other choice.",00:23:03.930,00:23:06.430
All of these are guesses.,00:23:06.430,00:23:08.900
"And some of these
things will lead to yes.",00:23:08.900,00:23:11.500
"Some of these things
will lead to no.",00:23:11.500,00:23:13.120
"And in this magical model,
if there's any yes out there,",00:23:13.120,00:23:17.040
you will follow a path to a yes.,00:23:17.040,00:23:19.660
"If all of the answers
are no, then, of course,",00:23:19.660,00:23:21.974
"it doesn't matter
what choices you make.",00:23:21.974,00:23:23.640
You will output no.,00:23:23.640,00:23:25.100
"But if there's ever a yes,
magically these guesses",00:23:25.100,00:23:27.940
find it.,00:23:27.940,00:23:28.580
This is the sense of lucky.,00:23:28.580,00:23:30.390
"If you're trying to find a
yes-- that's your goal in life--",00:23:30.390,00:23:33.940
then this corresponds to luck.,00:23:33.940,00:23:37.290
"And NP is the class of
all problems solvable",00:23:37.290,00:23:40.260
"in polynomial time by a
really lucky algorithm.",00:23:40.260,00:23:43.800
Crazy.,00:23:43.800,00:23:44.850
I know.,00:23:44.850,00:23:45.350
Let's talk about Tetris.,00:23:50.450,00:23:53.115
"Tetris, I claim, is in NP.",00:23:56.320,00:23:59.871
"And we know how to solve
it in exponential time.",00:23:59.871,00:24:01.870
Just try all the options.,00:24:01.870,00:24:04.280
"But, in fact, I don't need
to try all the options.",00:24:04.280,00:24:07.640
"It would be enough just use
this nondeterministic magic.",00:24:07.640,00:24:11.150
"I could say, well, should I
drop the piece here, here, here,",00:24:11.150,00:24:14.420
"here, here, or here.",00:24:14.420,00:24:15.739
"And should it be rotated
like this, or like this,",00:24:15.739,00:24:17.780
"or like this, or like this?",00:24:17.780,00:24:20.170
I don't know.,00:24:20.170,00:24:20.910
So I guess.,00:24:20.910,00:24:22.210
And I just place that piece.,00:24:22.210,00:24:23.775
"I make another guess where
to place the next piece.",00:24:23.775,00:24:25.900
"Then I make another guess
where to place the next piece.",00:24:25.900,00:24:27.550
"I implement the rules
of Tetris, which",00:24:27.550,00:24:29.520
"is if there's a
full line it clears.",00:24:29.520,00:24:32.426
"I figure out where
these things fall.",00:24:32.426,00:24:34.980
"I can even think about, should
I rotate at the last second.",00:24:34.980,00:24:39.080
"If I don't know, I'll guess.",00:24:39.080,00:24:41.894
"Any choice you have to
make in playing Tetris,",00:24:41.894,00:24:43.810
you can just guess.,00:24:43.810,00:24:45.280
"There's only polynomially
many guesses you need to make.",00:24:45.280,00:24:47.660
So it's still polynomial time.,00:24:47.660,00:24:49.600
That's important.,00:24:49.600,00:24:50.440
"It's not like we
can do anything.",00:24:50.440,00:24:52.060
"But we can make a polynomial
number these magic guesses.",00:24:52.060,00:24:54.770
"And then at the end, I
determine did I die--",00:24:54.770,00:24:59.330
"or rather, did I survive.",00:24:59.330,00:25:01.070
"It's important, actually.",00:25:01.070,00:25:02.120
It only works one way.,00:25:02.120,00:25:03.980
Did I survive?,00:25:03.980,00:25:04.780
Yes or no?,00:25:04.780,00:25:05.555
And that's easy to compute.,00:25:05.555,00:25:06.680
"I just see did I ever
go above the top row.",00:25:06.680,00:25:11.120
"So what this model says
is if there is any way",00:25:11.120,00:25:13.640
"to survive-- if there is
any way to get a yes answer,",00:25:13.640,00:25:17.100
"then, my guesses will find
it, magically, in this model.",00:25:17.100,00:25:21.220
"Therefore, Tetris is in NP.",00:25:21.220,00:25:22.370
"If I had instead
said, did I die, then,",00:25:24.980,00:25:28.200
"what this algorithm would
tell me is there any way",00:25:28.200,00:25:31.120
"to die-- which, the
answer's probably yes,",00:25:31.120,00:25:33.970
"unless you're given a
really trivial input.",00:25:33.970,00:25:36.360
"So it's important you set up
the yes versus no, correctly.",00:25:36.360,00:25:39.710
"But the Tetris decision problem
""can I survive,"" is in NP.",00:25:39.710,00:25:43.980
"The decision problem ""can I
die,"" should not be in NP.",00:25:43.980,00:25:48.670
But we don't know.,00:25:48.670,00:25:49.494
Another way to think about NP.,00:25:57.110,00:25:58.430
"And you might find
this intuitive",00:26:01.382,00:26:02.950
"because we've been
doing lots of guessing.",00:26:02.950,00:26:04.800
It's just a little crazy.,00:26:04.800,00:26:06.330
"There's another way that's
more intuitive to many people.",00:26:06.330,00:26:11.490
"So if this doesn't make
sense, don't worry, yet.",00:26:11.490,00:26:14.520
"This is another
way to phrase it.",00:26:14.520,00:26:16.110
"Another way to think
about NP-- which turns out",00:26:53.152,00:26:55.110
"to be equivalent-- is that don't
think so much about algorithms",00:26:55.110,00:27:01.450
"for solving a problem,
just think about algorithms",00:27:01.450,00:27:04.300
"for checking the
solution to a problem.",00:27:04.300,00:27:07.437
"It's usually a lot
easier to check your work",00:27:07.437,00:27:09.270
"than it is to solve a
problem in the first place.",00:27:09.270,00:27:11.980
And NP is all about that issue.,00:27:11.980,00:27:15.400
"So think of decision
problems and think",00:27:15.400,00:27:17.540
"about if you have a solution--
so let's say in Tetris,",00:27:17.540,00:27:21.270
the solution is yes.,00:27:21.270,00:27:24.790
"In fact, I need to
say this, probably.",00:27:24.790,00:27:27.660
"The more formal
version is whenever",00:27:27.660,00:27:31.150
"the answer is yes,
you can prove it.",00:27:31.150,00:27:37.900
"And you can check that
proof in polynomial time.",00:27:41.880,00:27:44.100
"This is the more formal--
this a little bit high level.",00:27:49.890,00:27:53.140
What does check mean?,00:27:53.140,00:27:54.130
Here's what check means.,00:27:54.130,00:27:56.080
"Whenever an answer is ""yes,""
you can write down a proof",00:27:56.080,00:27:59.560
that the answer is yes.,00:27:59.560,00:28:00.900
"And someone can
come along and check",00:28:00.900,00:28:02.400
"that proof in polynomial
time and be convinced",00:28:02.400,00:28:04.370
that the answer is yes.,00:28:04.370,00:28:06.310
What does convinced mean?,00:28:06.310,00:28:07.600
It's not that hard.,00:28:07.600,00:28:09.800
"Think of it is a
two player game.",00:28:09.800,00:28:11.660
"There's me trying
to play Tetris,",00:28:11.660,00:28:13.400
"and there's you
trying to be convinced",00:28:13.400,00:28:15.400
that I'm really good at Tetris.,00:28:15.400,00:28:18.100
"It seems a little one sided,
but-- it's a asymmetric game.",00:28:18.100,00:28:23.060
"So you want to prove Tetris is--
I want to show Tetris is in NP.",00:28:23.060,00:28:27.420
"Imagine I'm this
magical creature.",00:28:27.420,00:28:29.790
"Actually, it's kind of funny.",00:28:29.790,00:28:31.160
It reminds me of a story.,00:28:31.160,00:28:32.680
"On the front of my
office door, you",00:28:32.680,00:28:34.620
"may have seen there's
an email I received,",00:28:34.620,00:28:37.540
"maybe 15 years
ago-- oh no, I guess",00:28:37.540,00:28:39.900
it can't be that long ago.,00:28:39.900,00:28:42.100
"Must've been about
7 years ago when",00:28:42.100,00:28:43.710
"we proved that Tetris
is NP-complete.",00:28:43.710,00:28:47.040
"And the email says, ""Dear
Sir,""-- or whatever--",00:28:47.040,00:28:51.660
"""I am NP-complete.""",00:28:51.660,00:28:54.349
"We don't what
NP-complete means, yet,",00:28:54.349,00:28:55.890
"but it's a
meaningless statement.",00:28:55.890,00:28:57.310
"So it doesn't matter that
you don't know what it means.",00:28:57.310,00:28:59.640
"It might get funnier
throughout the lecture today.",00:28:59.640,00:29:03.940
"And he's like, I
can solve Tetris.",00:29:03.940,00:29:07.860
"I'm really good
at playing Tetris.",00:29:07.860,00:29:09.534
"I'm really good at
playing Minesweeper--",00:29:09.534,00:29:11.200
"all these games that are
thought to be intractable.",00:29:11.200,00:29:14.210
"He gave me his
records and so on.",00:29:14.210,00:29:15.810
"It's like how can
I apply my talent.",00:29:15.810,00:29:20.230
"So I will translate what he
meant to say was, ""I am lucky.""",00:29:20.230,00:29:26.230
"And this is probably
not true, but he",00:29:26.230,00:29:29.017
thought that he was lucky.,00:29:29.017,00:29:30.100
"He wanted to convince
me he was lucky.",00:29:30.100,00:29:31.940
So how could we do it?,00:29:31.940,00:29:33.610
"Well, I could give him a
really hard Tetris problem.",00:29:33.610,00:29:36.540
"And say, can you
survive these pieces?",00:29:36.540,00:29:38.870
"And he says, ""yes,
I can survive. """,00:29:38.870,00:29:41.450
"And how does he prove to
me that he can survive?",00:29:41.450,00:29:43.450
"Well, he just plays it.",00:29:43.450,00:29:45.150
He shows me what to do.,00:29:45.150,00:29:47.420
"So proof is sequence
of moves that you make.",00:29:47.420,00:29:53.740
"It's really easy
to convince someone",00:29:53.740,00:29:55.870
"that you can survive a
given level of Tetris.",00:29:55.870,00:30:00.290
"You just show what the
sequence of moves are.",00:30:00.290,00:30:04.380
"And then I, as a mere mortal
polynomial time algorithm",00:30:04.380,00:30:07.860
"can check that that
sequence works.",00:30:07.860,00:30:09.780
"I just have to implement
the rules of Tetris.",00:30:09.780,00:30:12.064
"So in Tetris, the rules
are easy to implement.",00:30:12.064,00:30:13.980
"Its the knowing what
thing to do is hard.",00:30:13.980,00:30:18.120
"But in NP, knowing
which way to go is easy.",00:30:18.120,00:30:21.840
"In this version,
you don't even talk",00:30:21.840,00:30:23.340
about how to find the solution.,00:30:23.340,00:30:24.820
"It's just a matter
of can you write down",00:30:24.820,00:30:26.486
a solution that can be checked.,00:30:26.486,00:30:29.280
Can prove it.,00:30:29.280,00:30:30.000
This is not in polynomial time.,00:30:30.000,00:30:31.420
"You get arbitrarily
much time to prove it.",00:30:31.420,00:30:34.710
"But then, the check has to
happen in polynomial time.",00:30:34.710,00:30:37.540
Kind of clear?,00:30:41.047,00:30:41.630
That's Tetris.,00:30:44.290,00:30:46.450
"And every problem that you
can solve in polynomial",00:30:46.450,00:30:49.220
"time you can also,
of course, check it.",00:30:49.220,00:30:51.049
"Because if you could solve
it in polynomial time,",00:30:51.049,00:30:53.090
"you could just solve
it and then see",00:30:53.090,00:30:54.590
"did you get the same
answer that I did.",00:30:54.590,00:30:56.320
So P is inside NP.,00:30:56.320,00:30:59.790
"But the big question
is does p equal NP.",00:30:59.790,00:31:04.910
And most people think no.,00:31:04.910,00:31:08.600
"P does not equal NP--
most sane people.",00:31:08.600,00:31:12.060
So this is a big problem.,00:31:16.690,00:31:18.910
"It's one of the famous
Millennium Prize problems.",00:31:18.910,00:31:21.900
"So in particular, if you solved
it, you would get $1 million,",00:31:21.900,00:31:27.030
"and fame, and probably
other fortune.",00:31:27.030,00:31:29.080
You could do TV spots.,00:31:29.080,00:31:31.060
"I think that's how people
mostly make their money.",00:31:31.060,00:31:34.160
You could do a lot.,00:31:34.160,00:31:35.280
"You would become the most famous
computer scientist in the world",00:31:35.280,00:31:38.020
if you prove this.,00:31:38.020,00:31:40.020
So a lot of people have tried.,00:31:40.020,00:31:41.270
"Every year, there's an
attempt to prove either",00:31:41.270,00:31:44.070
"what everyone believes
or, most often,",00:31:44.070,00:31:46.500
"people try to prove the
reverse-- that they are equal.",00:31:46.500,00:31:49.742
I don't know why.,00:31:49.742,00:31:50.450
They should bet the other way.,00:31:50.450,00:31:53.250
"So what does P does
not equal NP mean?",00:31:53.250,00:31:55.360
"It means that there are
problems, here, that are in NP",00:31:55.360,00:32:00.040
"but not in P. Think
about what this means.",00:32:00.040,00:32:03.240
"This is saying P are the
problems that we can actually",00:32:03.240,00:32:05.810
solve on a legitimate computer.,00:32:05.810,00:32:07.680
"NP are problems that we can
solve in this magical fairy",00:32:07.680,00:32:10.950
"computer where all of
our dreams are granted.",00:32:10.950,00:32:14.370
"You say, oh, I don't
know which way to go.",00:32:14.370,00:32:16.120
"It doesn't matter because
the machine magically",00:32:16.120,00:32:19.510
tells you which way to go.,00:32:19.510,00:32:21.400
"If you're goal is
to get to a yes.",00:32:21.400,00:32:24.210
"So NP is a really powerful
model of computation.",00:32:24.210,00:32:27.930
"It's an insane model
of computation.",00:32:27.930,00:32:29.690
"No one in their right mind
would consider it legitimate.",00:32:29.690,00:32:32.100
"So obviously, it's
more powerful than P,",00:32:32.100,00:32:35.250
"except we don't know
how to prove it.",00:32:35.250,00:32:37.727
Very annoying.,00:32:37.727,00:32:38.310
"Other phrasings of
P does not equal",00:32:45.480,00:32:47.450
"NP is-- these are my
phrasings, I them up-- you",00:32:47.450,00:32:50.870
can't engineer luck.,00:32:50.870,00:32:53.090
"You can believe in
luck, if you want.",00:32:57.520,00:32:59.160

"That's the meaning
of this statement.",00:33:03.960,00:33:07.545
"And so I think most
people believe that.",00:33:07.545,00:33:09.485
"Another phrasing would
be that solving problems",00:33:13.530,00:33:19.520
"is harder than
checking solutions.",00:33:19.520,00:33:22.460
"A more formal version is that
generating solutions or proofs",00:33:27.300,00:33:30.645
"of solutions can be
harder than checking them.",00:33:30.645,00:33:37.510
"Another phrasing is
it's harder to generate",00:33:44.850,00:33:47.860
"a proof of a theorem
than it is to check",00:33:47.860,00:33:49.550
the proof of a theorem.,00:33:49.550,00:33:50.780
"We all know checking
the proof of a theorem",00:33:50.780,00:33:53.400
"should be easy if you
write it precisely.",00:33:53.400,00:33:56.000
"Just make sure each step
follows from the previous ones.",00:33:56.000,00:33:58.420
Done.,00:33:58.420,00:34:00.152
"But proving a
theorem, that's hard.",00:34:00.152,00:34:01.610
You need inspiration.,00:34:01.610,00:34:02.550
You need some clever idea.,00:34:02.550,00:34:03.740
That's guessing.,00:34:03.740,00:34:04.920
"Inspiration equals luck equals
guessing, in this model.",00:34:04.920,00:34:09.020
And that's hard.,00:34:09.020,00:34:10.370
"The only way we know is
to try all the proofs.",00:34:13.380,00:34:15.880
See which of them work.,00:34:15.880,00:34:17.270
So what the heck?,00:34:24.020,00:34:26.350
What could we possibly say?,00:34:26.350,00:34:27.510
This is all kind of weird.,00:34:27.510,00:34:30.020
"This would be the
end of the lecture",00:34:30.020,00:34:31.520
"if you say, OK,
well we don't know.",00:34:31.520,00:34:34.770
That's it.,00:34:34.770,00:34:37.350
"But thankfully-- I kind
of need this board.",00:34:37.350,00:34:41.524
"I also want this one, but
I guess I'll go over here.",00:34:41.524,00:34:43.690
"Fortunately, this is not
the end of the story.",00:34:48.364,00:34:50.280
"And we can say a lot
about things like Tetris.",00:34:50.280,00:34:55.340
"See I drew Tetris not
just in this regime.",00:34:55.340,00:34:57.930
"We're pretty sure Tetris
is between NP and P.",00:34:57.930,00:35:01.330
That it's in NP minus P.,00:35:01.330,00:35:06.480
So let me write that down.,00:35:06.480,00:35:08.830
"Tetris is in NP minus P. We
don't know that because we",00:35:08.830,00:35:16.640
"don't know-- this
could be the empty set.",00:35:16.640,00:35:20.070
"What we do know
is that if there's",00:35:20.070,00:35:26.040
"anything in NP minus P--
if they are different,",00:35:26.040,00:35:32.040
"then-- if there's
anything in NP minus P,",00:35:32.040,00:35:35.900
"then Tetris is one
of those things.",00:35:35.900,00:35:39.060
"That's why I drew
Tetris out there.",00:35:39.060,00:35:40.760
"It is, in a certain sense,
the hardest problem in NP.",00:35:40.760,00:35:45.800
Tetris.,00:35:45.800,00:35:47.690
Why Tetris?,00:35:47.690,00:35:49.550
"Well, it's not just Tetris.",00:35:49.550,00:35:50.809
"There are a lot of problems
right at that little notch.",00:35:50.809,00:35:53.100
"But this is pretty interesting
because, while we can't figure",00:35:53.100,00:35:57.220
"this out, most people
believe this is true.",00:35:57.220,00:35:59.920
"And so as long as you
believe in that-- as long",00:35:59.920,00:36:01.982
"as you have faith--
then you can prove",00:36:01.982,00:36:05.920
that Tetris is in NP minus P.,00:36:05.920,00:36:08.160
And so it's hard.,00:36:08.160,00:36:09.650
"It's not in P, in this case.",00:36:09.650,00:36:11.880
"In particular, not in
P. That's kind of cool.",00:36:11.880,00:36:19.739
"How in the world do we
prove something like this?",00:36:19.739,00:36:21.780
It's actually not that hard.,00:36:21.780,00:36:23.910
"I mean it took us
several months,",00:36:23.910,00:36:25.830
"but that's just months, whereas
this thing has been around",00:36:25.830,00:36:29.640
"since, I guess, the '70s.",00:36:29.640,00:36:33.170
P versus NP.,00:36:33.170,00:36:36.030
Why is this true?,00:36:36.030,00:36:38.760
Because Tetris is NP-hard.,00:36:38.760,00:36:42.960
What does NP-hard mean?,00:36:46.210,00:36:48.420
"This means as hard as
every problem in NP.",00:36:48.420,00:36:54.640
"I can't say harder than
because it's non-strict.",00:36:59.340,00:37:02.010
"So it's at least as hard
as every problem in NP.",00:37:02.010,00:37:04.910
"And that's why I drew
it at the far right.",00:37:04.910,00:37:07.580
"It's sort of the
hardest extreme of NP.",00:37:07.580,00:37:10.340
"Among everything in NP
you can possibly imagine,",00:37:10.340,00:37:13.030
"Tetris is as hard
as all of them.",00:37:13.030,00:37:16.000
"And therefore, if there's
anything that's harder than P,",00:37:16.000,00:37:19.430
"then Tetris is going to be
harder than P because it's",00:37:19.430,00:37:22.350
as far to the right as possible.,00:37:22.350,00:37:23.700
"Either P equals NP, in which
case the picture is like this.",00:37:23.700,00:37:27.490
Here's P. Here's NP.,00:37:27.490,00:37:29.920
"Tetris is still at the
right extreme, here.",00:37:29.920,00:37:32.300
"But it's less interesting
because it's still in P.",00:37:32.300,00:37:35.430
"Or the picture looks like
this, and NP is strictly",00:37:35.430,00:37:37.590
"bigger than P. And then, because
Tetris is at the right extreme,",00:37:37.590,00:37:41.020
"it's outside of P. So
we prove this in order",00:37:41.020,00:37:45.290
to establish this claim.,00:37:45.290,00:37:47.110
"Just to get some
terminology, what",00:37:51.010,00:37:52.630
is this NP-complete business?,00:37:52.630,00:37:53.940
"Tetris is NP-complete,
which means two things.",00:37:58.810,00:38:09.550
One is that it's NP-hard.,00:38:09.550,00:38:11.470
"And the other is
that it's in NP.",00:38:11.470,00:38:13.960
"So if you think of the
intersection, NP intersect",00:38:13.960,00:38:16.340
"NP-hard, that's NP-complete.",00:38:16.340,00:38:18.210
"Let me draw on the picture
here what this means.",00:38:18.210,00:38:26.490
"So I'm going to
draw it on the top.",00:38:26.490,00:38:28.140
This is NP-hard.,00:38:38.590,00:38:39.720
"Everything from here to
the right is NP-hard.",00:38:42.390,00:38:46.040
"NP-hard means it's at least
as hard as everything in NP.",00:38:46.040,00:38:48.922
"That means it might
be at this line",00:38:48.922,00:38:50.380
or it might be to the right.,00:38:50.380,00:38:52.390
"But in the case of Tetris,
we know that it's in NP.",00:38:52.390,00:38:55.130
"We proved that a
couple of times.",00:38:55.130,00:38:57.494
"And so we know that Tetris
is also in this range.",00:38:57.494,00:38:59.535
"And so if it's in this
range and in this range,",00:38:59.535,00:39:01.850
it's got to be right here.,00:39:01.850,00:39:03.690
Completeness is nice.,00:39:03.690,00:39:04.940
"If you prove something
is something complete--",00:39:04.940,00:39:07.370
"prove a problem is some
complexity class complete--",00:39:07.370,00:39:09.920
"then you know sort of exactly
where it falls on this line.",00:39:09.920,00:39:13.550
NP-complete means right here.,00:39:13.550,00:39:15.750
EXP-complete means right here.,00:39:15.750,00:39:18.520
Turns out Chess is EXP-complete.,00:39:18.520,00:39:22.880
"EXP-hard is anything
from here over.",00:39:22.880,00:39:27.710
"EXP is anything from
here, over this way.",00:39:27.710,00:39:30.670
"Chess is right at
that borderline.",00:39:30.670,00:39:32.335
"It is the hardest
problem in EXP.",00:39:32.335,00:39:34.512
"And that's actually
the only way we",00:39:34.512,00:39:35.970
know to prove that it's not NP.,00:39:35.970,00:39:37.970
"It's is pretty easy to
show that EXP is bigger",00:39:37.970,00:39:39.970
"than P. And Chess is the
farthest to the right in EXP--",00:39:39.970,00:39:43.770
"of any problem in EXP-- and
so, therefore, it's not in P.",00:39:43.770,00:39:47.800
"So whereas this one-- these two,
we're not sure are they equal.",00:39:47.800,00:39:51.350
"This line we know is
different from this one.",00:39:51.350,00:39:55.190
"We don't know about
these two, though.",00:39:55.190,00:39:58.720
Does NP equal EXP?,00:39:58.720,00:40:01.550
Not as famous.,00:40:01.550,00:40:02.240
"You won't get a million
dollars, but still a very big,",00:40:02.240,00:40:04.850
open question.,00:40:04.850,00:40:07.550
What else do I wanna say?,00:40:07.550,00:40:09.590
"Tetris, Chess, EXP-hard.",00:40:09.590,00:40:11.020
"So these lines, here--
this is NP-complete",00:40:11.020,00:40:16.369
And this is EXP-complete.,00:40:16.369,00:40:17.410
"So the last thing I want to
talk about is reductions.",00:40:35.980,00:40:39.015
"Reductions-- so how do you
prove something like this?",00:40:43.770,00:40:45.980
What is as hard as even mean?,00:40:45.980,00:40:47.710
I haven't defined that.,00:40:47.710,00:40:49.230
But it's not hard to define.,00:40:49.230,00:40:51.270
"In fact, it's a concept
we've seen already.",00:40:51.270,00:40:53.130
"Reductions are actually a
way to design algorithms",00:41:18.610,00:41:21.380
"that we've been using
implicitly a lot.",00:41:21.380,00:41:24.354
"You may have even
heard this term.",00:41:24.354,00:41:25.770
"A bunch of recitations have
used the word reduction",00:41:25.770,00:41:28.010
for graph reduction.,00:41:28.010,00:41:29.970
"You have some problem,
you convert it",00:41:29.970,00:41:31.770
"into a graph problem, then you
just call the graph algorithm.",00:41:31.770,00:41:34.590
You're done.,00:41:34.590,00:41:35.830
That's reduction.,00:41:35.830,00:41:36.760
"In general, you have
some problem, A,",00:41:36.760,00:41:38.820
that you want to solve.,00:41:38.820,00:41:40.830
"And you convert it into
some other problem, B,",00:41:40.830,00:41:44.030
"that you already
know how to solve.",00:41:44.030,00:41:46.182
"It's a great tool
because, in this class,",00:41:46.182,00:41:47.890
"you learn tons of algorithms
for solving tons of problems.",00:41:47.890,00:41:50.630
"Now, someone gives you,
in your job or whatever,",00:41:50.630,00:41:55.070
"or you think about
some problem that you",00:41:55.070,00:41:56.950
"don't know how to solve,
the first thing you should",00:41:56.950,00:41:59.180
"do is-- can I convert
it into something",00:41:59.180,00:42:01.000
"I know how to solve
because then you're done.",00:42:01.000,00:42:02.930
"Now it may not be the
best way to solve it,",00:42:02.930,00:42:04.721
"but at least it's
a way to solve it.",00:42:04.721,00:42:06.410
"Probably in polynomial time
because we think of B as things",00:42:06.410,00:42:09.015
"you can solve in
polynomial time.",00:42:09.015,00:42:10.390
Great.,00:42:10.390,00:42:13.160
"So just convert
problem A, which you",00:42:13.160,00:42:20.730
"want to solve, into some problem
B that you know how to solve.",00:42:20.730,00:42:27.615
That's reduction.,00:42:30.690,00:42:32.370
"Let me give you some examples
that we've already seen,",00:42:32.370,00:42:35.460

mental map of the class.",00:42:35.460,00:42:38.065
"It's kind of a funny one
but it's a very simple one.",00:42:42.640,00:42:45.060

unweighted shortest paths?",00:42:52.470,00:42:54.460
In general?,00:42:58.300,00:42:59.810
Easy one.,00:42:59.810,00:43:00.670

you're smart or if you",00:43:07.600,00:43:10.050
feel like implementing BFS.,00:43:10.050,00:43:11.250

gave you Djikstra.",00:43:11.250,00:43:14.380

got Djikstra code.",00:43:14.380,00:43:16.125

"There's Djisktra
code right there.",00:43:17.375,00:43:18.940
"But Djikstra solves
weighted shortest path.",00:43:18.940,00:43:21.100
I don't have any weights.,00:43:21.100,00:43:22.160
What do I do?,00:43:22.160,00:43:24.960
Set the weights to 1.,00:43:24.960,00:43:28.140
"It's very easy, but
this is a reduction--",00:43:28.140,00:43:30.630
a simple example of reduction.,00:43:30.630,00:43:32.460
"Not the smartest of reductions,

"Adding weights of
0 would not work.",00:43:44.320,00:43:46.070
But weights of 1.,00:43:46.070,00:43:47.170
OK.,00:43:47.170,00:43:47.900
Weights of 2 also works.,00:43:47.900,00:43:49.492
"Pick your favorite number, but
as long as you're consistent",00:43:49.492,00:43:51.950
about it.,00:43:51.950,00:43:52.780
That's a reduction.,00:43:52.780,00:43:54.520
"Here's some more
interesting ones.",00:43:54.520,00:43:56.570
"On the problems set--
problem set six--",00:43:56.570,00:44:03.920
"there was this RenBook problem,

"That was the name
of the problem.",00:44:08.205,00:44:09.580

to solve-- to find",00:44:09.580,00:44:14.640
"paths that minimize
the product of weights.",00:44:14.640,00:44:17.884

Logs.,00:44:26.070,00:44:26.990

"That converts
products into sums.",00:44:28.920,00:44:31.597

"This is a problem that you could
take Djikstra or Bellman-Ford,",00:44:32.930,00:44:37.150

relaxation steps",00:44:37.150,00:44:39.390

"You have to prove that
that's still correct.",00:44:46.570,00:44:49.200
It's annoying to think about.,00:44:49.200,00:44:50.500

"It's not modular,
blah, blah, blah.",00:44:52.660,00:44:54.590

do this reduction,",00:44:54.590,00:44:56.720
"you can use exactly the
code that you had before,",00:44:56.720,00:44:59.990
at the end.,00:44:59.990,00:45:01.960
So that's nice.,00:45:01.960,00:45:03.220
"This is why
reductions are really",00:45:03.220,00:45:04.670

technique because you don't",00:45:04.670,00:45:07.562

for every single problem you",00:45:07.562,00:45:10.020
have.,00:45:10.020,00:45:10.700

reuse some of those algorithms",00:45:10.700,00:45:13.200

"Another one, which was on the
quiz in the true-false-- quiz",00:45:17.100,00:45:21.680
"two-- was converting longest
path into shortest path.",00:45:21.680,00:45:25.532
"We didn't phrase
it as a reduction.",00:45:25.532,00:45:26.990
"It was just can you
solve longest path using",00:45:26.990,00:45:29.730
Bellman-Ford.,00:45:29.730,00:45:30.910
And the answer is yes.,00:45:30.910,00:45:31.832
You just negate all the weights.,00:45:31.832,00:45:33.165
"And that converts a
longest path problem",00:45:33.165,00:45:34.900
into a shortest path problem.,00:45:34.900,00:45:37.660
Easy.,00:45:37.660,00:45:40.310
"Also on the quiz-- maybe I don't
need to write all of these down",00:45:40.310,00:45:43.030
"because they're a little
bit weird problems.",00:45:43.030,00:45:45.200
We made them up.,00:45:45.200,00:45:46.370

the duck tour called?",00:45:46.370,00:45:50.220

"You want to visit a bunch of
sites in some specified order.",00:45:53.610,00:45:56.990
"The point in that problem
is you could reduce it",00:45:56.990,00:45:58.990
"to a single shortest
paths query.",00:45:58.990,00:46:02.900
"And so if you already
have shortest path code,",00:46:02.900,00:46:05.682
you don't have to think much.,00:46:05.682,00:46:06.890
"You just do the
graph application.",00:46:06.890,00:46:08.400
Done.,00:46:08.400,00:46:09.970
"Then there's the
leaky tank problem,",00:46:09.970,00:46:11.600
"which is also a graph
reduction problem.",00:46:11.600,00:46:14.570
"You could represent all

"And it's a very
powerful technique.",00:46:20.202,00:46:21.660
"In this class, we see it
mostly in graph reductions.",00:46:21.660,00:46:24.860
"But it could apply
all over the place.",00:46:24.860,00:46:28.120
"And while this is a powerful
technique for coming up",00:46:28.120,00:46:30.810
"with new algorithms, it's
also a powerful technique",00:46:30.810,00:46:34.310
"for proving things

is that a problem",00:46:41.380,00:46:43.830
"called 3-Partition can
be reduced to Tetris.",00:46:43.830,00:46:49.600
What's 3-Partition?,00:46:57.810,00:46:58.610
"3-Partition is I
give you n numbers.",00:46:58.610,00:47:01.000
"I want to know can I
divide them into triples,",00:47:01.000,00:47:03.930
each of the same sum.,00:47:03.930,00:47:06.450
So I have n numbers.,00:47:06.450,00:47:07.780
"Divide them into n
over 3 groups of 3,",00:47:07.780,00:47:10.170
"such that the sum of
each of the 3s is equal.",00:47:10.170,00:47:14.030
"Sounds like an easy
enough problem.",00:47:14.030,00:47:15.780
But it's an NP-complete problem.,00:47:15.780,00:47:18.230
"And people knew that since
one of the first papers.",00:47:18.230,00:47:22.950
"I guess that was late
'70s, early '80s, by Karp.",00:47:22.950,00:47:26.790
"So Karp already proved
this is standing",00:47:26.790,00:47:28.800
on the shoulders of giants.,00:47:28.800,00:47:32.410
"Karp proved 3-Partition
is NP-complete,",00:47:32.410,00:47:34.360

think about that.",00:47:34.360,00:47:37.060
"All I need to
focus on is showing",00:47:37.060,00:47:39.210
"that Tetris is harder
than 3-Partition.",00:47:39.210,00:47:43.470
This is what I mean by harder.,00:47:43.470,00:47:45.270
"Harder means-- so when
I can reduce A to B,",00:47:45.270,00:47:48.990
"we say the A-- B is at least
as hard as A. Why's that?",00:47:48.990,00:48:02.090
"Because I can solve A by solving
B. I just apply this reduction",00:48:02.090,00:48:05.820
"and then solve B. So if I
had some good way to solve B,",00:48:05.820,00:48:08.570
"it would turn into a
good way to solve A.",00:48:08.570,00:48:11.110
"Now 3-Partition-- which
is A, here-- we're",00:48:11.110,00:48:14.940
"pretty sure there's no good
algorithm for solving this.",00:48:14.940,00:48:17.440
"Pretty sure it's not in P.
And so Tetris better not be P",00:48:17.440,00:48:22.900
"either because if
Tetris were in P, then",00:48:22.900,00:48:25.430
"we could just take
our 3-Partition,",00:48:25.430,00:48:27.140

3-Partition would be in P.",00:48:27.140,00:48:30.990
"In fact, all of the
NP-complete problems,",00:48:30.990,00:48:33.210
you can reduce to each other.,00:48:33.210,00:48:36.470

is at that little position,",00:48:36.470,00:48:39.820

you need to do is",00:48:39.820,00:48:41.900
