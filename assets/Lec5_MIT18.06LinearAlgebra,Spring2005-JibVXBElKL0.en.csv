Okay.,00:00:09.860,00:00:10.620
"This is lecture five
in linear algebra.",00:00:10.620,00:00:14.290
"And, it will complete
this chapter of the book.",00:00:14.290,00:00:19.015
"So the last section
of this chapter",00:00:21.620,00:00:24.030
"is two point seven that talks
about permutations, which",00:00:24.030,00:00:30.060
"finished the previous
lecture, and transposes,",00:00:30.060,00:00:34.240
"which also came in
the previous lecture.",00:00:34.240,00:00:36.650
"There's a little more to do
with those guys, permutations",00:00:36.650,00:00:40.750
and transposes.,00:00:40.750,00:00:42.860
"But then the heart of the
lecture will be the beginning",00:00:42.860,00:00:48.180
"of what you could say is the
beginning of linear algebra,",00:00:48.180,00:00:51.910
"the beginning of real linear
algebra which is seeing",00:00:51.910,00:00:57.470
"a bigger picture with vector
spaces -- not just vectors,",00:00:57.470,00:01:01.590
"but spaces of vectors and
sub-spaces of those spaces.",00:01:01.590,00:01:06.650
"So we're a little ahead
of the syllabus, which",00:01:06.650,00:01:11.110
"is good, because we're
coming to the place",00:01:11.110,00:01:13.150
"where, there's a lot to",00:01:13.150,00:01:15.780
do.,00:01:15.780,00:01:16.620
Okay.,00:01:16.620,00:01:17.800
"So, to begin with permutations.",00:01:17.800,00:01:22.400
Can I just --,00:01:22.400,00:01:26.790
"so these permutations, those
are matrices P and they execute",00:01:26.790,00:01:36.850
row exchanges.,00:01:36.850,00:01:38.400
And we may need them.,00:01:42.160,00:01:44.910
"We may have a
perfectly good matrix,",00:01:44.910,00:01:47.120
"a perfect matrix A that's
invertible that we can solve A",00:01:47.120,00:01:52.310
"x=b, but to do it --",00:01:52.310,00:01:55.580
"I've got to allow myself
that extra freedom",00:01:55.580,00:02:00.050
"that if a zero shows up in the
pivot position I move it away.",00:02:00.050,00:02:05.070
I get a non-zero.,00:02:05.070,00:02:06.630
"I get a proper pivot there by
exchanging from a row below.",00:02:06.630,00:02:12.460
"And you've seen that
already, and I just",00:02:12.460,00:02:15.000
"want to collect
the ideas together.",00:02:15.000,00:02:18.200
"And principle, I
could even have to do",00:02:18.200,00:02:21.310
"that two times, or more times.",00:02:21.310,00:02:24.750
So I have to allow --,00:02:24.750,00:02:27.290
to complete the --,00:02:27.290,00:02:29.330
"the theory, the possibility
that I take my matrix A,",00:02:29.330,00:02:34.370
"I start elimination, I find
out that I need row exchanges",00:02:34.370,00:02:38.540
"and I do it and
continue and I finish.",00:02:38.540,00:02:41.620
Okay.,00:02:41.620,00:02:42.750
"Then all I want to do is say --
and I won't make a big project",00:02:42.750,00:02:49.150
out of this --,00:02:49.150,00:02:51.160
what happens to A equal L U?,00:02:51.160,00:02:54.300
So A equal L U --,00:02:54.300,00:02:59.570
"this was a matrix L with ones
on the diagonal and zeroes",00:02:59.570,00:03:05.130
"above and multipliers
below, and this U",00:03:05.130,00:03:09.450
"we know, with zeroes down here.",00:03:09.450,00:03:13.425
That's only possible.,00:03:16.940,00:03:19.080
"That description of
elimination assumes",00:03:19.080,00:03:21.770
"that we don't have a P, that we
don't have any row exchanges.",00:03:21.770,00:03:26.480
"And now I just want
to say, okay, how",00:03:26.480,00:03:29.570
do I account for row exchanges?,00:03:29.570,00:03:31.220
Because that doesn't.,00:03:31.220,00:03:33.990
"The P in this factorization
is the identity matrix.",00:03:33.990,00:03:40.030
"The rows were in a good
order, we left them there.",00:03:40.030,00:03:44.140
"Maybe I'll just add a
little moment of reality,",00:03:44.140,00:03:47.830
"too, about how Matlab
actually does elimination.",00:03:47.830,00:03:55.190
"Matlab not only checks whether
that pivot is not zero,",00:03:55.190,00:03:59.520
as every human would do.,00:03:59.520,00:04:02.770
"It checks for is that
pivot big enough,",00:04:02.770,00:04:05.480
"because it doesn't like
very, very small pivots.",00:04:05.480,00:04:09.380
"Pivots close to zero
are numerically bad.",00:04:09.380,00:04:13.550
"So actually if we ask
Matlab to solve a system,",00:04:13.550,00:04:16.660
"it will do some elimination
some row exchanges, which",00:04:16.660,00:04:21.420
we don't think are necessary.,00:04:21.420,00:04:23.180
"Algebra doesn't say they're
necessary, but accuracy --",00:04:23.180,00:04:27.930
"numerical accuracy
says they are.",00:04:27.930,00:04:31.680
"Well, we're doing
algebra, so here we",00:04:31.680,00:04:35.930
"will say, well, what
do row exchanges do,",00:04:35.930,00:04:39.380
"but we won't do them
unless we have to.",00:04:39.380,00:04:42.230
But we may have to.,00:04:42.230,00:04:45.340
"And then, the result is --",00:04:45.340,00:04:50.380
it's hiding here.,00:04:50.380,00:04:51.850
It's the main fact.,00:04:51.850,00:04:56.040
"This is the description of
elimination with row exchanges.",00:04:56.040,00:05:00.100
"So A equal L U
becomes P A equal L U.",00:05:00.100,00:05:12.280
"So this P is the matrix
that does the row exchanges,",00:05:12.280,00:05:15.210
and actually it does them --,00:05:15.210,00:05:18.080
"it gets the rows
into the right order,",00:05:18.080,00:05:20.780
"into the good order
where pivots will not --",00:05:20.780,00:05:23.810
"where zeroes won't appear
in the pivot position,",00:05:23.810,00:05:27.120
"where L and U will come
out right as up here.",00:05:27.120,00:05:32.700
"So, that's the point.",00:05:32.700,00:05:36.430
"Actually, I don't want
to labor that point,",00:05:36.430,00:05:39.650
that a permutation matrix --,00:05:39.650,00:05:43.110
"and you remember
what those were.",00:05:43.110,00:05:47.260
"I'll remind you from last time
of what the main points about",00:05:47.260,00:05:51.280
permutation matrices were --,00:05:51.280,00:05:57.820
"and then just leave
this factorization",00:05:57.820,00:06:00.340
as the general case.,00:06:00.340,00:06:03.820
"This is -- any
invertible A we get this.",00:06:03.820,00:06:17.220
"For almost every one,
we don't need a P.",00:06:17.220,00:06:20.090
"But there's that handful
that do need row exchanges,",00:06:20.090,00:06:24.220
"and if we do need
them, there they are.",00:06:24.220,00:06:26.480
"Okay, finally, just to
remember what P was.",00:06:26.480,00:06:30.410
"So permutations, P is
the identity matrix",00:06:30.410,00:06:46.440
with reordered rows.,00:06:46.440,00:06:51.480
"I include in reordering the
possibility that you just",00:06:56.710,00:06:59.707
leave them the same.,00:06:59.707,00:07:00.540
"So the identity
matrix is -- okay.",00:07:00.540,00:07:02.880
"That's, like, your basic
permutation matrix --",00:07:02.880,00:07:08.490
"your do-nothing permutation
matrix is the identity.",00:07:08.490,00:07:12.840
"And then there are the ones
that exchange two rows and then",00:07:12.840,00:07:15.730
"the ones that exchange three
rows and then then ones that",00:07:15.730,00:07:18.940
exchange four --,00:07:18.940,00:07:21.040
"well, it gets a little --",00:07:21.040,00:07:24.640
"it gets more interesting
algebraically",00:07:24.640,00:07:27.310
"if you've got four rows,
you might exchange them",00:07:27.310,00:07:30.630
all in one big cycle.,00:07:30.630,00:07:32.190
"One to two, two to three,
three to four, four to one.",00:07:32.190,00:07:35.550
"Or you might have -- exchange
one and two and three and four.",00:07:35.550,00:07:41.070
Lots of possibilities there.,00:07:41.070,00:07:42.467
"In fact, how many possibilities?",00:07:42.467,00:07:43.800
The answer was (n)factorial.,00:07:46.570,00:07:49.310
This is n(n-1)(n-2)...,00:07:49.310,00:07:50.984
(3)(2)(1).,00:07:56.920,00:07:58.230
"That's the number of --
this counts the reorderings,",00:07:58.230,00:08:05.100
the possible reorderings.,00:08:05.100,00:08:07.990
"So it counts all the
n by n permutations.",00:08:07.990,00:08:15.730
"And all those
matrices have these --",00:08:23.170,00:08:26.200
"have this nice property
that they're all invertible,",00:08:26.200,00:08:32.380
"because we can bring those rows
back into the normal order.",00:08:32.380,00:08:39.140
"And the matrix that
does that is just P --",00:08:39.140,00:08:42.679
"is just the same
as the transpose.",00:08:42.679,00:08:46.590
"You might take a
permutation matrix,",00:08:46.590,00:08:49.180
"multiply by its transpose
and you will see how --",00:08:49.180,00:08:51.820
"that the ones hit the ones and
give the ones in the identity",00:08:51.820,00:08:57.220
matrix.,00:08:57.220,00:08:58.010
So this is a --,00:08:58.010,00:08:59.980
"we'll be highly
interested in matrices",00:08:59.980,00:09:02.590
that have nice properties.,00:09:02.590,00:09:04.980
"And one property that -- maybe
I could rewrite that as P",00:09:04.980,00:09:09.580
transpose P is the identity.,00:09:09.580,00:09:13.880
"That tells me in
other words that this",00:09:13.880,00:09:16.950
is the inverse of that.,00:09:16.950,00:09:19.300
Okay.,00:09:19.300,00:09:20.210
"We'll be interested in
matrices that have P transpose",00:09:20.210,00:09:25.940
P equal the identity.,00:09:25.940,00:09:27.940
"There are more of them
than just permutations,",00:09:27.940,00:09:30.470
"but my point right now is that
permutations are like a little",00:09:30.470,00:09:35.000
group in the middle --,00:09:35.000,00:09:36.870
"in the center of these
special matrices.",00:09:36.870,00:09:42.180
Okay.,00:09:42.180,00:09:43.270
"So now we know how
many there are.",00:09:43.270,00:09:47.590
"Twenty four in the case of
-- there are twenty four four",00:09:47.590,00:09:50.750
"by four permutations, there
are five factorial which is",00:09:50.750,00:09:55.960
"a hundred and twenty, five times
twenty four would bump us up",00:09:55.960,00:10:00.340
"to a hundred and twenty -- so
listing all the five by five",00:10:00.340,00:10:03.710
"permutations would
be not so much fun.",00:10:03.710,00:10:09.990
Okay.,00:10:09.990,00:10:12.380
So that's permutations.,00:10:12.380,00:10:15.320
"Now also in section two seven is
some discussion of transposes.",00:10:15.320,00:10:20.960
"And can I just complete
that discussion.",00:10:20.960,00:10:22.895
"First of all, I haven't
even transposed a matrix",00:10:25.610,00:10:30.910
"on the board here, have I?",00:10:30.910,00:10:32.110
So I'd better do it.,00:10:32.110,00:10:33.710
"So suppose I take a matrix
like (1 2 4; 3 3 1).",00:10:33.710,00:10:39.975
"It's a rectangular
matrix, three by two.",00:10:43.660,00:10:47.640
And I want to transpose it.,00:10:47.640,00:10:51.030
So what's --,00:10:51.030,00:10:53.380
"I'll use a T, also
Matlab would use a prime.",00:10:53.380,00:10:59.040
And the result will be --,00:10:59.040,00:11:02.050
"I'll right it here, because this
was three rows and two columns,",00:11:02.050,00:11:07.770
this was a three by two matrix.,00:11:07.770,00:11:10.060
"The transpose will be two
rows and three columns,",00:11:10.060,00:11:13.080
two by three.,00:11:13.080,00:11:15.380
So it's short and wider.,00:11:15.380,00:11:20.180
"And, of course, that row --
that column becomes a row --",00:11:20.180,00:11:25.730
"that column becomes
the other row.",00:11:25.730,00:11:27.510
"And at the same time,
that row became a column.",00:11:30.060,00:11:36.200
This row became a column.,00:11:36.200,00:11:37.970
"Oh, what's the general
formula for the transpose?",00:11:37.970,00:11:41.610
So the transpose --,00:11:41.610,00:11:48.920
you see it in numbers.,00:11:48.920,00:11:50.740
"What I'm going to write is
the same thing in symbols.",00:11:50.740,00:11:54.570
"The numbers are the
clearest, of course.",00:11:54.570,00:11:57.920
"But in symbols, if
I take A transpose",00:11:57.920,00:12:04.170
"and I ask what number is in row
I and column J of A transpose?",00:12:04.170,00:12:10.135
"Well, it came out of A.",00:12:14.600,00:12:16.320
"It came out A by this flip
across the main diagonal.",00:12:16.320,00:12:22.080
"And, actually, it
was the number in A",00:12:22.080,00:12:28.030
"which was in row J, column I.",00:12:28.030,00:12:34.540
So the row and column --,00:12:34.540,00:12:36.920
"the row and column
numbers just get reversed.",00:12:36.920,00:12:39.880
"The row number becomes
the column number,",00:12:39.880,00:12:42.030
"the column number
becomes the row number.",00:12:42.030,00:12:44.450
No problem.,00:12:44.450,00:12:45.610
Okay.,00:12:45.610,00:12:46.260
"Now, a special --",00:12:46.260,00:12:49.280
"the best matrices, we could say.",00:12:49.280,00:12:52.880
"In a lot of applications,
symmetric matrices show up.",00:12:52.880,00:12:58.590
"So can I just call attention
to symmetric matrices?",00:12:58.590,00:13:02.145
What does that mean?,00:13:07.960,00:13:08.840
"What does that word
symmetric mean?",00:13:08.840,00:13:11.110
"It means that this transposing
doesn't change the matrix.",00:13:11.110,00:13:16.000
A transpose equals A.,00:13:16.000,00:13:17.690
And an example.,00:13:17.690,00:13:21.255
"So, let's take a matrix
that's symmetric,",00:13:25.740,00:13:29.900
"so whatever is sitting
on the diagonal --",00:13:29.900,00:13:33.750
"but now what's above the
diagonal, like a one,",00:13:33.750,00:13:36.800
"had better be there, a
seven had better be here,",00:13:36.800,00:13:41.630
a nine had better be there.,00:13:41.630,00:13:43.410
There's a symmetric matrix.,00:13:43.410,00:13:47.460
"I happened to use all positive
numbers as its entries.",00:13:47.460,00:13:52.420
That's not the point.,00:13:52.420,00:13:54.030
"The point is that if I
transpose that matrix,",00:13:54.030,00:13:57.160
I get it back again.,00:13:57.160,00:13:58.880
"So symmetric matrices have this
property A transpose equals A.",00:13:58.880,00:14:03.370
I guess at this point --,00:14:03.370,00:14:07.150
"I'm just asking you to notice
this family of matrices that",00:14:07.150,00:14:14.130
are unchanged by transposing.,00:14:14.130,00:14:17.830
"And they're easy to
identify, of course.",00:14:17.830,00:14:22.950
"You know, it's not maybe so
easy before we had a case where",00:14:22.950,00:14:28.060
the transpose gave the inverse.,00:14:28.060,00:14:31.830
"That's highly important,
but not so simple to see.",00:14:31.830,00:14:36.230
"This is the case where the
transpose gives the same matrix",00:14:36.230,00:14:39.200
back again.,00:14:39.200,00:14:39.720
That's totally simple to see.,00:14:39.720,00:14:42.510
Okay.,00:14:42.510,00:14:43.380
"Could actually -- maybe I could
even say when would we get such",00:14:43.380,00:14:49.410
a matrix?,00:14:49.410,00:14:51.150
"For example, this -- that
matrix is absolutely far from",00:14:51.150,00:14:55.740
"symmetric, right?",00:14:55.740,00:14:57.850
"The transpose isn't
even the same shape --",00:14:57.850,00:15:01.150
"because it's rectangular,
it turns the --",00:15:01.150,00:15:03.700
lies down on its side.,00:15:03.700,00:15:06.580
"But let me tell you a way to
get a symmetric matrix out of",00:15:06.580,00:15:10.970
this.,00:15:10.970,00:15:11.880
Multiply those together.,00:15:11.880,00:15:14.640
"If I multiply this
rectangular, shall I",00:15:14.640,00:15:17.210
call it R for rectangular?,00:15:17.210,00:15:18.910
"So let that be R for
rectangular matrix",00:15:18.910,00:15:22.890
"and let that be R
transpose, which it is.",00:15:22.890,00:15:27.580
"Then I think that if I
multiply those together,",00:15:27.580,00:15:32.000
I get a symmetric matrix.,00:15:32.000,00:15:34.390
"Can I just do it
with the numbers",00:15:34.390,00:15:36.780
"and then ask you why, how did
I know it would be symmetric?",00:15:36.780,00:15:44.700
"So my point is that R transpose
R is always symmetric.",00:15:44.700,00:15:52.415
Okay?,00:15:52.415,00:15:52.914
"And I'm going to do it for that
particular R transpose R which",00:15:57.560,00:16:01.470
was --,00:16:01.470,00:16:02.750
"let's see, the column was
one two four three three one.",00:16:02.750,00:16:05.815
"I called that one R
transpose, didn't I,",00:16:09.700,00:16:11.700
"and I called this guy one
two four three three one.",00:16:11.700,00:16:16.030
I called that R.,00:16:16.030,00:16:17.550
"Shall we just do
that multiplication?",00:16:17.550,00:16:19.970
"Okay, so up here
I'm getting a ten.",00:16:19.970,00:16:22.960
"Next to it I'm getting two, a
nine, I'm getting an eleven.",00:16:22.960,00:16:27.310
"Next to that I'm getting
four and three, a seven.",00:16:27.310,00:16:30.390
Now what do I get there?,00:16:30.390,00:16:32.650
"This eleven came from one
three times two three, right?",00:16:32.650,00:16:37.650
"Row one, column two.",00:16:37.650,00:16:39.720
What goes here?,00:16:39.720,00:16:41.530
"Row two, column one.",00:16:41.530,00:16:43.360
But no difference.,00:16:43.360,00:16:46.050
"One three two three or two
three one three, same thing.",00:16:46.050,00:16:50.220
It's going to be an eleven.,00:16:50.220,00:16:51.750
That's the symmetry.,00:16:51.750,00:16:54.310
I can continue to fill it out.,00:16:54.310,00:16:56.230
"What -- oh, let's
get that seven.",00:16:56.230,00:16:58.100
"That seven will show
up down here, too,",00:16:58.100,00:17:00.520
and then four more numbers.,00:17:00.520,00:17:02.650
"That seven will show up here
because one three times four",00:17:02.650,00:17:06.619
"one gave the seven, but also
four one times one three",00:17:06.619,00:17:10.630
will give that seven.,00:17:10.630,00:17:11.599
Do you see that it works?,00:17:11.599,00:17:16.030
"Actually, do you want to see it
work also in matrix language?",00:17:16.030,00:17:24.630
"I mean, that's quite
convincing, right?",00:17:24.630,00:17:27.089
That seven is no accident.,00:17:27.089,00:17:29.965
The eleven is no accident.,00:17:32.630,00:17:35.550
"But just tell me how do I know
if I transpose this guy --",00:17:35.550,00:17:40.680
How do I know it's symmetric?,00:17:40.680,00:17:42.820
"Well, I'm going to transpose it.",00:17:42.820,00:17:45.620
"And when I transpose
it, I'm hoping",00:17:45.620,00:17:49.610
I get the matrix back again.,00:17:49.610,00:17:52.210
"So can I transpose
R transpose R?",00:17:52.210,00:17:54.630
"So just -- so, why?",00:17:54.630,00:17:56.157
"Well, my suggestion
is take the transpose.",00:17:59.880,00:18:02.945
"That's the only way to
show it's symmetric.",00:18:09.800,00:18:11.670
"Take the transpose and
see that it didn't change.",00:18:11.670,00:18:14.340
"Okay, so I take the
transpose of R transpose R.",00:18:14.340,00:18:19.970
Okay.,00:18:19.970,00:18:20.470
How do I do that?,00:18:20.470,00:18:23.190
"This is our little practice
on the rules for transposes.",00:18:23.190,00:18:27.680
"So the rule for transposes
is the order gets reversed.",00:18:27.680,00:18:33.780
"Just like inverses,
which we did prove,",00:18:33.780,00:18:38.300
"same rule for transposes
and -- which we'll now use.",00:18:38.300,00:18:44.390
So the order gets reversed.,00:18:44.390,00:18:46.110
"It's the transpose of
that that comes first,",00:18:46.110,00:18:51.600
"and the transpose of
this that comes -- no.",00:18:51.600,00:18:56.880
Is that -- yeah.,00:18:56.880,00:18:58.010
"That's what I have
to write, right?",00:18:58.010,00:19:01.130
"This is a product of two
matrices and I want its",00:19:01.130,00:19:03.500
transpose.,00:19:03.500,00:19:04.350
"So I put the matrices
in the opposite order",00:19:04.350,00:19:06.880
and I transpose them.,00:19:06.880,00:19:08.480
But what have I got here?,00:19:08.480,00:19:09.780
What is R transpose transpose?,00:19:09.780,00:19:12.320
"Well, don't all speak at once.",00:19:15.300,00:19:18.670
"R transpose transpose, I
flipped over the diagonal,",00:19:18.670,00:19:22.080
"I flipped over the diagonal
again, so I've got R.",00:19:22.080,00:19:28.540
"And that's just my point, that
if I started with this matrix,",00:19:28.540,00:19:32.770
"I transposed it, I
got it back again.",00:19:32.770,00:19:34.740
"So that's the check, without
using numbers, but with --",00:19:37.850,00:19:46.810
"it checked in two lines that I
always get symmetric matrices",00:19:46.810,00:19:52.510
this way.,00:19:52.510,00:19:53.480
"And actually, that's
where they come",00:19:53.480,00:19:55.680
"from in so many
practical applications.",00:19:55.680,00:20:00.220
Okay.,00:20:00.220,00:20:02.730
"So now I've said something today
about permutations and about",00:20:02.730,00:20:07.580
"transposes and about
symmetry and I'm ready",00:20:07.580,00:20:14.540
for chapter three.,00:20:14.540,00:20:17.290
Can we take a breath --,00:20:17.290,00:20:21.550
"the tape won't take a breath,
but the lecturer will,",00:20:21.550,00:20:25.250
"because to tell you
about vector spaces is --",00:20:25.250,00:20:31.980
"we really have to start now
and think, okay, listen up.",00:20:31.980,00:20:38.220
What are vector spaces?,00:20:38.220,00:20:39.500
And what are sub-spaces?,00:20:47.400,00:20:48.400
Okay.,00:20:51.160,00:20:51.890
"So, the point is, The main
operations that we do --",00:20:51.890,00:21:01.430
what do we do with vectors?,00:21:01.430,00:21:04.450
We add them.,00:21:04.450,00:21:05.820
We know how to add two vectors.,00:21:05.820,00:21:07.270
"We multiply them by numbers,
usually called scalers.",00:21:09.880,00:21:13.930
"If we have a vector, we
know what three V is.",00:21:13.930,00:21:17.350
"If we have a vector V and
W, we know what V plus W is.",00:21:17.350,00:21:24.030
"Those are the two
operations that we've",00:21:24.030,00:21:26.670
got to be able to do.,00:21:26.670,00:21:29.090
"To legitimately talk
about a space of vectors,",00:21:29.090,00:21:33.220
"the requirement
is that we should",00:21:33.220,00:21:35.870
"be able to add the things
and multiply by numbers",00:21:35.870,00:21:39.990
"and that there should be
some decent rules satisfied.",00:21:39.990,00:21:44.380
Okay.,00:21:44.380,00:21:45.370
So let me start with examples.,00:21:45.370,00:21:48.590
"So I'm talking now
about vector spaces.",00:21:48.590,00:21:50.755
"And I'm going to
start with examples.",00:21:56.810,00:21:58.685
"Let me say again what this
word space is meaning.",00:22:06.690,00:22:09.480
"When I say that word
space, that means to me",00:22:09.480,00:22:14.010
"that I've got a bunch of
vectors, a space of vectors.",00:22:14.010,00:22:19.440
"But not just any
bunch of vectors.",00:22:19.440,00:22:21.010
"It has to be a
space of vectors --",00:22:24.010,00:22:28.720
"has to allow me to do the
operations that vectors",00:22:28.720,00:22:31.300
are for.,00:22:31.300,00:22:32.740
"I have to be able to add
vectors and multiply by numbers.",00:22:32.740,00:22:37.110
"I have to be able to
take linear combinations.",00:22:37.110,00:22:39.560
"Well, where did we meet
linear combinations?",00:22:39.560,00:22:43.120
"We met them back in, say in R^2.",00:22:43.120,00:22:48.960
So there's a vector space.,00:22:48.960,00:22:51.370
What's that vector space?,00:22:51.370,00:22:54.010
"So R two is telling me I'm
talking about real numbers",00:22:54.010,00:22:59.270
"and I'm talking about
two real numbers.",00:22:59.270,00:23:01.370
"So this is all two
dimensional vectors --",00:23:01.370,00:23:11.470
"real, such as --",00:23:11.470,00:23:16.580
"well, I'm not going to
be able to list them all.",00:23:16.580,00:23:18.750
But let me put a few down.,00:23:18.750,00:23:20.210
"|3; 2|, |0;0|, |pi; e|.",00:23:20.210,00:23:30.420
So on.,00:23:30.420,00:23:30.920
And it's natural -- okay.,00:23:35.450,00:23:39.890
"Let's see, I guess I
should do algebra first.",00:23:39.890,00:23:44.270
"Algebra means what can
I do to these vectors?",00:23:44.270,00:23:46.980
I can add them.,00:23:46.980,00:23:48.130
I can add that to that.,00:23:48.130,00:23:50.520
And how do I do it?,00:23:50.520,00:23:51.660
"A component at a
time, of course.",00:23:51.660,00:23:54.460
"Three two added to zero
zero gives me, three two.",00:23:54.460,00:23:58.240
Sorry about that.,00:23:58.240,00:24:00.190
"Three two added to pi e gives
me three plus pi, two plus e.",00:24:00.190,00:24:05.780
"Oh, you know what it does.",00:24:05.780,00:24:07.260
"And you know the picture
that goes with it.",00:24:07.260,00:24:11.240
There's the vector three two.,00:24:11.240,00:24:14.830
"And often, the
picture has an arrow.",00:24:14.830,00:24:19.520
"The vector zero zero, which is
a highly important vector --",00:24:19.520,00:24:22.550
"it's got, like, the
most important here",00:24:22.550,00:24:24.610
-- is there.,00:24:24.610,00:24:25.930
"And of course there's
not much of an arrow.",00:24:25.930,00:24:29.840
"Pi -- I'll have to remember --
pi is about three and a little",00:24:29.840,00:24:35.110
"more, e is about two
and a little more.",00:24:35.110,00:24:37.570
So maybe there's pi e.,00:24:37.570,00:24:41.090
I never drew pi e before.,00:24:41.090,00:24:44.690
It's just natural to --,00:24:44.690,00:24:47.030
"this is the first
component on the horizontal",00:24:47.030,00:24:55.560
"and this is the
second component,",00:24:55.560,00:24:59.470
going up the vertical.,00:24:59.470,00:25:02.010
Okay.,00:25:02.010,00:25:02.910
And the whole plane is R two.,00:25:02.910,00:25:07.570
"So R two is, we
could say, the plane.",00:25:07.570,00:25:14.980
The xy plane.,00:25:14.980,00:25:17.710
That's what everybody thinks.,00:25:17.710,00:25:18.920
"But the point is it's a vector
space because all those vectors",00:25:24.770,00:25:32.800
are in there.,00:25:32.800,00:25:34.140
If I removed one of them --,00:25:34.140,00:25:37.380
Suppose I removed zero zero.,00:25:37.380,00:25:39.420
"Suppose I tried to take the --
considered the X Y plane with",00:25:39.420,00:25:43.480
"a puncture, with
a point removed.",00:25:43.480,00:25:46.360
Like the origin.,00:25:46.360,00:25:47.200
"That would be, like, awful
to take the origin away.",00:25:47.200,00:25:50.470
Why is that?,00:25:50.470,00:25:52.570
Why do I need the origin there?,00:25:52.570,00:25:54.550
"Because I have to be allowed --
if I had these other vectors,",00:25:54.550,00:25:59.570
"I have to be allowed to
multiply three two --",00:25:59.570,00:26:03.330
this was three two --,00:26:03.330,00:26:05.610
"by anything, by any
scaler, including zero.",00:26:05.610,00:26:09.820
"I've got to be allowed
to multiply by zero",00:26:09.820,00:26:12.020
"and the result's
got to be there.",00:26:12.020,00:26:15.010
I can't do without that point.,00:26:15.010,00:26:18.110
"And I have to be able to add
three two to the opposite guy,",00:26:18.110,00:26:23.670
minus three minus two.,00:26:23.670,00:26:26.800
"And if I add those I'm
back to the origin again.",00:26:26.800,00:26:29.230
"No way I can do
without the origin.",00:26:29.230,00:26:31.360
"Every vector space has got
that zero vector in it.",00:26:31.360,00:26:36.280
"Okay, that's an
easy vector space,",00:26:36.280,00:26:38.650
"because we have a
natural picture of it.",00:26:38.650,00:26:42.520
Okay.,00:26:42.520,00:26:43.840
Similarly easy is R^3.,00:26:43.840,00:26:46.260
"This would be all -- let
me go up a little here.",00:26:50.340,00:26:54.630
This would be --,00:26:54.630,00:26:57.820
"R three would be all three
dimensional vectors --",00:26:57.820,00:27:02.670
"or shall I say vectors
with three real components.",00:27:02.670,00:27:09.645
Okay.,00:27:14.320,00:27:15.000
"Let me just to be
sure we're together,",00:27:15.000,00:27:21.030
"let me take the
vector three two zero.",00:27:21.030,00:27:23.661
Is that a vector in R^2 or R^3?,00:27:29.410,00:27:33.390
Definitely it's in R^3.,00:27:33.390,00:27:38.490
It's got three components.,00:27:38.490,00:27:40.150
"One of them happens to be zero,
but that's a perfectly okay",00:27:40.150,00:27:43.040
number.,00:27:43.040,00:27:43.850
So that's a vector in R^3.,00:27:43.850,00:27:48.290
We don't want to mix up the --,00:27:48.290,00:27:51.590
"I mean, keep these vectors
straight and keep R^n straight.",00:27:51.590,00:27:55.090
So what's R^n?,00:27:55.090,00:27:57.630
R^n.,00:27:57.630,00:27:59.150
"So this is our big example, is
all vectors with n components.",00:27:59.150,00:28:05.990
"And I'm making these darn
things column vectors.",00:28:05.990,00:28:11.170
"Can I try to follow
that convention,",00:28:11.170,00:28:14.050
"that they'll be column vectors,
and their components should",00:28:14.050,00:28:17.530
be real numbers.,00:28:17.530,00:28:20.690
"Later we'll need complex
numbers and complex vectors,",00:28:20.690,00:28:24.830
but much later.,00:28:24.830,00:28:26.721
Okay.,00:28:26.721,00:28:27.220
So that's a vector space.,00:28:27.220,00:28:28.780
"Now, let's see.",00:28:31.420,00:28:33.670
"What do I have to tell
you about vector spaces?",00:28:33.670,00:28:35.910
"I said the most important thing,
which is that we can add any",00:28:35.910,00:28:44.090
"two of these and
we -- still in R^2.",00:28:44.090,00:28:46.760
"We can multiply by any number
and we're still in R^2.",00:28:46.760,00:28:50.220
"We can take any combination
and we're still in R^2.",00:28:50.220,00:28:53.380
And same goes for R^n.,00:28:53.380,00:28:55.290
"It's -- honesty requires me to
mention that these operations",00:28:55.290,00:29:02.240
"of adding and multiplying
have to obey a few rules.",00:29:02.240,00:29:08.300
"Like, we can't just arbitrarily
say, okay, the sum of three two",00:29:08.300,00:29:12.790
and pi e is zero zero.,00:29:12.790,00:29:15.610
It's not.,00:29:15.610,00:29:18.410
"The sum of three two and
minus three two is zero zero.",00:29:18.410,00:29:22.650
"So -- oh, I'm not going
to -- the book, actually,",00:29:22.650,00:29:27.030
"lists the eight rules that the
addition and multiplication",00:29:27.030,00:29:32.420
"have to satisfy, but they do.",00:29:32.420,00:29:34.680
"They certainly satisfy it in
R^n and usually it's not those",00:29:34.680,00:29:38.810
eight rules that are in doubt.,00:29:38.810,00:29:42.170
"What's -- the question is, can
we do those additions and do we",00:29:42.170,00:29:50.070
stay in the space?,00:29:50.070,00:29:51.250
"Let me show you a
case where you can't.",00:29:51.250,00:29:55.580
"So suppose this is going
to be not a vector space.",00:29:55.580,00:29:59.810
"Suppose I take the xy
plane -- so there's R^2.",00:30:05.490,00:30:08.780
That is a vector space.,00:30:08.780,00:30:11.240
"Now suppose I just
take part of it.",00:30:11.240,00:30:15.940
Just this.,00:30:15.940,00:30:17.670
"Just this one -- this is one
quarter of the vector space.",00:30:17.670,00:30:22.270
"All the vectors with positive
or at least not negative",00:30:24.910,00:30:29.965
components.,00:30:29.965,00:30:30.465
Can I add those safely?,00:30:33.070,00:30:37.540
Yes.,00:30:37.540,00:30:38.410
"If I add a vector
with, like, two --",00:30:38.410,00:30:41.690
"three two to another
vector like five six,",00:30:41.690,00:30:45.030
"I'm still up in this quarter,
no problem with adding.",00:30:45.030,00:30:48.950
"But there's a heck of a problem
with multiplying by scalers,",00:30:48.950,00:30:54.860
"because there's a lot of
scalers that will take me out",00:30:54.860,00:30:58.690
"of this quarter plane,
like negative ones.",00:30:58.690,00:31:02.280
"If I took three two and I
multiplied by minus five,",00:31:02.280,00:31:05.820
I'm way down here.,00:31:05.820,00:31:08.240
"So that's not a vector
space, because it's not --",00:31:08.240,00:31:12.220
closed is the right word.,00:31:12.220,00:31:14.250
"It's not closed
under multiplication",00:31:14.250,00:31:17.870
by all real numbers.,00:31:17.870,00:31:19.850
"So a vector space has to be
closed under multiplication",00:31:22.500,00:31:27.150
and addition of vectors.,00:31:27.150,00:31:29.010
"In other words,
linear combinations.",00:31:29.010,00:31:31.680
"It -- so, it means that if
I give you a few vectors --",00:31:31.680,00:31:37.560
"yeah look, here's an
important -- here --",00:31:37.560,00:31:39.980
"now we're getting to some
really important vector spaces.",00:31:39.980,00:31:42.420
"Well, R^n -- like, they
are the most important.",00:31:42.420,00:31:47.460
"But we will be interested in
so- in vector spaces that are",00:31:47.460,00:31:52.520
inside R^n.,00:31:52.520,00:31:55.700
"Vector spaces that follow
the rules, but they --",00:31:55.700,00:32:01.790
"we don't need all of -- see,
there we started with R^2 here,",00:32:01.790,00:32:10.140
"and took part of it
and messed it up.",00:32:10.140,00:32:15.060
"What we got was
not a vector space.",00:32:15.060,00:32:17.420
"Now tell me a vector space that
is part of R^2 and is still",00:32:17.420,00:32:25.670
"safely -- we can multiply, we
can add and we stay in this",00:32:25.670,00:32:31.480
smaller vector space.,00:32:31.480,00:32:32.880
"So it's going to be
called a subspace.",00:32:32.880,00:32:35.680
"So I'm going to change this
bad example to a good one.",00:32:35.680,00:32:40.990
Okay.,00:32:40.990,00:32:42.440
"So I'm going to
start again with R^2,",00:32:42.440,00:32:45.620
"but I'm going to take an
example -- it is a vector space,",00:32:45.620,00:32:50.120
"so it'll be a vector
space inside R^2.",00:32:50.120,00:32:53.805
"And we'll call that
a subspace of R^2.",00:32:56.970,00:33:03.560
Okay.,00:33:06.450,00:33:07.040
What can I do?,00:33:07.040,00:33:09.010
It's got something in it.,00:33:09.010,00:33:11.960
"Suppose it's got
this vector in it.",00:33:11.960,00:33:14.730
Okay.,00:33:14.730,00:33:17.070
"If that vector's in
my little subspace",00:33:17.070,00:33:19.740
"and it's a true
subspace, then there's",00:33:19.740,00:33:23.500
"got to be some more in it,",00:33:23.500,00:33:24.990
right?,00:33:24.990,00:33:25.640
"I have to be able to
multiply that by two,",00:33:25.640,00:33:28.900
"and that double vector
has to be included.",00:33:28.900,00:33:33.660
"Have to be able to multiply
by zero, that vector,",00:33:33.660,00:33:36.610
"or by half, or by
three quarters.",00:33:36.610,00:33:39.420
All these vectors.,00:33:39.420,00:33:40.310
"Or by minus a half,
or by minus one.",00:33:40.310,00:33:44.470
"I have to be able to
multiply by any number.",00:33:44.470,00:33:48.730
"So that is going to say that I
have to have that whole line.",00:33:48.730,00:33:52.250
Do you see that?,00:33:52.250,00:33:56.410
Once I get a vector in there --,00:33:56.410,00:33:58.440
"I've got the whole line of
all multiples of that vector.",00:33:58.440,00:34:03.070
"I can't have a vector space
without extending to get",00:34:03.070,00:34:09.320
those multiples in there.,00:34:09.320,00:34:10.770
"Now I still have
to check addition.",00:34:10.770,00:34:12.399
But that comes out okay.,00:34:15.000,00:34:16.179
"This line is going to work,
because I could add something",00:34:16.179,00:34:20.560
"on the line to something
else on the line",00:34:20.560,00:34:23.219
and I'm still on the line.,00:34:23.219,00:34:26.540
"So, example.",00:34:26.540,00:34:28.469
"So this is all examples
of a subspace --",00:34:28.469,00:34:33.340
"our example is a line in R^2
actually -- not just any line.",00:34:33.340,00:34:45.199
"If I took this
line, would that --",00:34:45.199,00:34:50.239
so all the vectors on that line.,00:34:50.239,00:34:51.960
"So that vector and that vector
and this vector and this vector",00:34:51.960,00:34:56.929
--,00:34:56.929,00:34:58.380
"in lighter type, I'm drawing
something that doesn't work.",00:34:58.380,00:35:05.450
It's not a subspace.,00:35:05.450,00:35:07.510
"The line in R^2 --
to be a subspace,",00:35:07.510,00:35:09.890
"the line in R^2 must go
through the zero vector.",00:35:09.890,00:35:15.220
"Because -- why is
this line no good?",00:35:19.400,00:35:21.700
Let me do a dashed line.,00:35:21.700,00:35:23.140
"Because if I multiplied that
vector on the dashed line",00:35:27.500,00:35:31.290
"by zero, then I'm down here,
I'm not on the dashed line.",00:35:31.290,00:35:34.490
Z- zero's got to be.,00:35:34.490,00:35:36.620
"Every subspace has
got to contain zero --",00:35:36.620,00:35:39.920
"because I must be allowed to
multiply by zero and that will",00:35:39.920,00:35:43.230
always give me the zero vector.,00:35:43.230,00:35:46.300
Okay.,00:35:46.300,00:35:48.020
"Now, I was going to make --",00:35:48.020,00:35:51.410
create some subspaces.,00:35:51.410,00:35:54.460
"Oh, while I'm in R^2,
why don't we think of all",00:35:54.460,00:35:59.610
the possibilities.,00:35:59.610,00:36:01.110
"R two, there can't be that many.",00:36:01.110,00:36:03.760
"So what are the possible
subspaces of R^2?",00:36:03.760,00:36:07.510
Let me list them.,00:36:07.510,00:36:08.720
"So I'm listing now
the subspaces of R^2.",00:36:11.480,00:36:16.220
"And one possibility
that we always allow",00:36:19.660,00:36:23.750
"is all of R two, the whole
thing, the whole space.",00:36:23.750,00:36:29.760
"That counts as a
subspace of itself.",00:36:29.760,00:36:34.010
You always want to allow that.,00:36:34.010,00:36:35.830
Then the others are lines --,00:36:35.830,00:36:39.750
"any line, meaning infinitely
far in both directions",00:36:39.750,00:36:45.690
through the zero.,00:36:45.690,00:36:49.810
"So that's like
the whole space --",00:36:55.110,00:36:57.790
that's like whole two D space.,00:36:57.790,00:37:00.550
This is like one dimension.,00:37:00.550,00:37:02.860
Is this line the same as R^1 ?,00:37:02.860,00:37:05.320
No.,00:37:05.320,00:37:07.470
"You could say it
looks a lot like R^1.",00:37:07.470,00:37:11.200
"R^1 was just a line
and this is a line.",00:37:11.200,00:37:14.380
But this is a line inside R^2.,00:37:14.380,00:37:17.460
"The vectors here
have two components.",00:37:17.460,00:37:20.440
"So that's not the same as R^1,
because there the vectors only",00:37:20.440,00:37:23.600
have one component.,00:37:23.600,00:37:25.570
"Very close, you could
say, but not the same.",00:37:25.570,00:37:29.590
Okay.,00:37:29.590,00:37:30.320
"And now there's a
third possibility.",00:37:30.320,00:37:32.250
"There's a third
subspace that's --",00:37:36.550,00:37:40.940
"of R^2 that's not the whole
thing, and it's not a line.",00:37:40.940,00:37:47.970
It's even less.,00:37:47.970,00:37:50.170
It's just the zero vector alone.,00:37:50.170,00:37:52.840
"The zero vector alone, only.",00:37:52.840,00:37:55.170
"I'll often call this
subspace Z, just for zero.",00:38:01.250,00:38:05.550
"Here's a line, L.",00:38:05.550,00:38:07.700
"Here's a plane, all of R^2.",00:38:07.700,00:38:10.010
"So, do you see that
the zero vector's okay?",00:38:10.010,00:38:14.680
"You would just -- to
understand subspaces,",00:38:14.680,00:38:16.970
"we have to know the rules -- and
knowing the rules means that we",00:38:16.970,00:38:20.820
"have to see that yes, the
zero vector by itself,",00:38:20.820,00:38:25.040
"just this guy alone
satisfies the rules.",00:38:25.040,00:38:27.990
Why's that?,00:38:27.990,00:38:28.690
"Oh, it's too dumb to tell you.",00:38:28.690,00:38:31.320
"If I took that and added it
to itself, I'm still there.",00:38:31.320,00:38:36.430
"If I took that and multiplied
by seventeen, I'm still there.",00:38:36.430,00:38:40.320
"So I've done the operations,
adding and multiplying",00:38:40.320,00:38:44.070
"by numbers, that are
required, and I didn't go",00:38:44.070,00:38:47.010
outside this one point space.,00:38:47.010,00:38:50.300
"So that's always -- that's
the littlest subspace.",00:38:53.570,00:38:57.170
"And the largest subspace is the
whole thing and in-between come",00:38:57.170,00:39:00.930
all --,00:39:00.930,00:39:02.370
whatever's in between.,00:39:02.370,00:39:04.080
Okay.,00:39:04.080,00:39:04.580
"So for example, what's
in between for R^3?",00:39:04.580,00:39:07.610
"So if I'm in ordinary three
dimensions, the subspace is R,",00:39:07.610,00:39:12.100
"all of R^3 at one extreme,
the zero vector at the bottom.",00:39:12.100,00:39:18.250
"And then a plane, a
plane through the origin.",00:39:18.250,00:39:23.430
"Or a line, a line
through the origin.",00:39:23.430,00:39:26.510
"So with R^3, the subspaces were
R^3, plane through the origin,",00:39:26.510,00:39:32.970
"line through the origin and
a zero vector by itself,",00:39:32.970,00:39:37.560
"zero zero zero, just
that single vector.",00:39:37.560,00:39:43.030
"Okay, you've got the idea.",00:39:43.030,00:39:44.360
"But, now comes --",00:39:47.470,00:39:51.080
the reality is --,00:39:51.080,00:39:53.350
"what are these -- where
do these subspaces come --",00:39:53.350,00:39:57.530
"how do they come
out of matrices?",00:39:57.530,00:40:00.950
"And I want to take
this matrix --",00:40:00.950,00:40:06.080
"oh, let me take that matrix.",00:40:06.080,00:40:08.350
"So I want to create some
subspaces out of that matrix.",00:40:08.350,00:40:17.430
"Well, one subspace
is from the columns.",00:40:17.430,00:40:26.980
Okay.,00:40:26.980,00:40:29.760
"So this is the
important subspace,",00:40:29.760,00:40:34.050
"the first important subspace
that comes from that matrix --",00:40:34.050,00:40:38.190
"I'm going to -- let
me call it A again.",00:40:38.190,00:40:40.750
Back to -- okay.,00:40:40.750,00:40:44.370
I'm looking at the columns of A.,00:40:44.370,00:40:48.150
Those are vectors in R^3.,00:40:48.150,00:40:50.530
So the columns are in R^3.,00:40:50.530,00:40:52.380
The columns are in R^3.,00:40:52.380,00:40:58.100
"So I want those columns
to be in my subspace.",00:41:02.280,00:41:04.585
"Now I can't just put two
columns in my subspace",00:41:08.970,00:41:11.960
and call it a subspace.,00:41:11.960,00:41:14.512
"What do I have to throw in --
if I'm going to put those two",00:41:14.512,00:41:16.970
"columns in, what else has got
to be there to have a subspace?",00:41:16.970,00:41:21.460
"I must be able to
add those things.",00:41:21.460,00:41:25.050
So the sum of those columns --,00:41:25.050,00:41:28.460
"so these columns are in R^3,
and I have to be able --",00:41:28.460,00:41:34.970
"I'm, you know, I want
that to be in my subspace,",00:41:34.970,00:41:37.330
"I want that to be
in my subspace,",00:41:37.330,00:41:39.080
"but therefore I have to be able
to multiply them by anything.",00:41:39.080,00:41:42.880
"Zero zero zero has got
to be in my subspace.",00:41:42.880,00:41:45.910
"I have to be able to add
them so that four five five",00:41:45.910,00:41:48.630
is in the subspace.,00:41:48.630,00:41:50.150
"I've got to be able to add one
of these plus three of these.",00:41:50.150,00:41:53.054
"That'll give me
some other vector.",00:41:53.054,00:41:54.470
"I have to be able to take
all the linear combinations.",00:41:57.100,00:42:02.180
"So these are columns in R^3 and
all there linear combinations",00:42:02.180,00:42:14.200
form a subspace.,00:42:14.200,00:42:16.920
"What do I mean by
linear combinations?",00:42:21.260,00:42:23.400
"I mean multiply
that by something,",00:42:23.400,00:42:26.060
"multiply that by
something and add.",00:42:26.060,00:42:28.290
"The two operations of linear
algebra, multiplying by numbers",00:42:28.290,00:42:33.350
and adding vectors.,00:42:33.350,00:42:36.060
"And, if I include
all the results,",00:42:36.060,00:42:38.930
"then I'm guaranteed
to have a subspace.",00:42:38.930,00:42:40.875
I've done the job.,00:42:43.570,00:42:46.860
And we'll give it a name --,00:42:46.860,00:42:49.210
the column space.,00:42:49.210,00:42:49.960
Column space.,00:42:53.740,00:42:54.380
And maybe I'll call it C of A.,00:43:01.220,00:43:05.920
C for column space.,00:43:05.920,00:43:07.120
There's an idea there that --,00:43:11.580,00:43:15.020
"Like, the central idea
for today's lecture is --",00:43:15.020,00:43:22.750
got a few vectors.,00:43:22.750,00:43:25.220
"Not satisfied with
a few vectors,",00:43:25.220,00:43:27.130
we want a space of vectors.,00:43:27.130,00:43:29.800
"The vectors, they're in --
these vectors in -- are in R^3 ,",00:43:29.800,00:43:33.160
"so our space of vectors
will be vectors in R^3.",00:43:33.160,00:43:37.050
"The key idea's -- we
have to be able to take",00:43:37.050,00:43:40.940
their combinations.,00:43:40.940,00:43:42.400
"So tell me, geometrically,
if I drew all these things --",00:43:42.400,00:43:47.300
"like if I drew one two four,
that would be somewhere maybe",00:43:47.300,00:43:50.060
there.,00:43:50.060,00:43:50.930
"If I drew three three one,
who knows, might be --",00:43:50.930,00:43:54.740
"I don't know, I'll say there.",00:43:54.740,00:43:57.140
"There's column one,
there's column two.",00:43:57.140,00:44:01.690
"What else -- what's in
the whole column space?",00:44:01.690,00:44:06.700
"How do I draw the
whole column space now?",00:44:06.700,00:44:11.160
"I take all combinations
of those two vectors.",00:44:11.160,00:44:13.430
"Do I get -- well, I
guess I actually listed",00:44:15.970,00:44:18.220
the possibilities.,00:44:18.220,00:44:19.160
Do I get the whole space?,00:44:19.160,00:44:21.940
Do I get a plane?,00:44:21.940,00:44:24.190
"I get more than a
line, that's for sure.",00:44:24.190,00:44:26.984
"And I certainly get more
than the zero vector,",00:44:26.984,00:44:28.900
"but I do get the
zero vector included.",00:44:28.900,00:44:31.610
What do I get if I combine --,00:44:31.610,00:44:34.160
"take all the combinations
of two vectors in R^3 ?",00:44:34.160,00:44:39.115
So I've got all this stuff on --,00:44:44.040,00:44:46.450
"that whole line gets filled
out, that whole line gets filled",00:44:46.450,00:44:49.040
"out, but all in-between
gets filled out --",00:44:49.040,00:44:51.190
"between the two
lines because I --",00:44:51.190,00:44:52.900
"I allowed to add something
from one line, something",00:44:52.900,00:44:56.610
from the other.,00:44:56.610,00:44:57.850
You see what's coming?,00:44:57.850,00:44:58.810
I'm getting a plane.,00:44:58.810,00:44:59.643
"That's my -- and it's
through the origin.",00:45:05.060,00:45:06.790
"Those two vectors, namely one
two four and three three one,",00:45:10.210,00:45:17.950
"when I take all
their combinations,",00:45:17.950,00:45:20.590
I fill out a whole plane.,00:45:20.590,00:45:21.770
Please think about that.,00:45:21.770,00:45:25.240
"That's the picture
you have to see.",00:45:25.240,00:45:28.280
"You sure have to see it in R^3
, because we're going to do it",00:45:28.280,00:45:31.940
"in R^10, and we may take a
combination of five vectors",00:45:31.940,00:45:36.880
"in R^10, and what will we have?",00:45:36.880,00:45:40.740
God knows.,00:45:40.740,00:45:41.630
It's some subspace.,00:45:41.630,00:45:44.910
We'll have five vectors.,00:45:44.910,00:45:46.880
They'll all have ten components.,00:45:46.880,00:45:49.010
We take their combinations.,00:45:49.010,00:45:52.320
"We don't have R^5 , because our
vectors have ten components.",00:45:52.320,00:45:58.240
"And we possibly have, like,
some five dimensional flat thing",00:45:58.240,00:46:05.020
"going through the
origin for sure.",00:46:05.020,00:46:06.680
"Well, of course, if those five
vectors were all on the line,",00:46:09.220,00:46:12.110
"then we would only
get that line.",00:46:12.110,00:46:13.710
"So, you see, there are, like,
other possibilities here.",00:46:13.710,00:46:16.840
"It depends what -- it depends
on those five vectors.",00:46:16.840,00:46:21.690
"Just like if our two columns
had been on the same line,",00:46:21.690,00:46:25.440
"then the column space would
have been only a line.",00:46:25.440,00:46:28.640
Here it was a plane.,00:46:28.640,00:46:31.440
Okay.,00:46:31.440,00:46:31.940
I'm going to stop at that point.,00:46:35.700,00:46:37.610
"That's the central idea of
-- the great example of how",00:46:37.610,00:46:44.220
"to create a subspace
from a matrix.",00:46:44.220,00:46:48.960
"Take its columns, take
their combinations,",00:46:48.960,00:46:51.990
"all their linear combinations
and you get the column space.",00:46:51.990,00:46:57.360
"And that's the
central sort of --",00:46:57.360,00:47:01.060
"we're looking at linear
algebra at a higher level.",00:47:01.060,00:47:04.320
"When I look at A -- now,
I want to look at Ax=b.",00:47:04.320,00:47:07.600
"That'll be the first
thing in the next lecture.",00:47:07.600,00:47:10.090
"How do I understand
Ax=b in this language --",00:47:13.650,00:47:17.300
"in this new language of vector
spaces and column spaces.",00:47:17.300,00:47:22.580
And what are other subspaces?,00:47:22.580,00:47:24.830
"So the column space is a big
one, there are others to come.",00:47:24.830,00:47:30.230
"Okay, thanks.",00:47:30.230,00:47:32.270
