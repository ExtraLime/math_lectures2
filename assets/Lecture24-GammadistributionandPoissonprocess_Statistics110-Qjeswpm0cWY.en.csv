"Thought we'd start with a little
puzzle I'm trying to solve.",00:00:00.890,00:00:03.770
"Maybe you can help me with the puzzle,
okay?",00:00:03.770,00:00:07.530
"Maybe make a little less volume, thanks.",00:00:07.530,00:00:11.900
I don't need to echo that much.,00:00:11.900,00:00:13.020
"All right, so here's the puzzle.",00:00:13.020,00:00:16.350
"I thought this was
a pretty interesting one.",00:00:16.350,00:00:19.240
And maybe related to what we're gonna do.,00:00:19.240,00:00:21.405
"Okay, so the question is,
what's the next number in the sequence?",00:00:21.405,00:00:26.658
"0, 1, 2,",00:00:26.658,00:00:30.942
any ideas?,00:00:30.942,00:00:34.512
&gt;&gt; 4.,00:00:34.512,00:00:35.379
&gt;&gt; 4.,00:00:35.379,00:00:36.367
&gt;&gt; 3.,00:00:36.367,00:00:37.602
&gt;&gt; 3.,00:00:37.602,00:00:38.840
Any other suggestions?,00:00:38.840,00:00:40.550
"&gt;&gt; 1.
&gt;&gt; 1.",00:00:40.550,00:00:41.050
"&gt;&gt; 0.
&gt;&gt; Okay, no one has said the same number",00:00:42.940,00:00:44.350
"twice, so we have no consensus at all.",00:00:44.350,00:00:46.265
"&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; We have 0, 1, 4.",00:00:46.265,00:00:49.040
"&gt;&gt; 3.
&gt;&gt; 3.",00:00:50.210,00:00:50.880
"3, 2,
&gt;&gt; 5.",00:00:50.880,00:00:52.285
&gt;&gt; 5.,00:00:52.285,00:00:52.785
"42, that's a good one.",00:00:56.874,00:01:00.800
1 over e would be a good guess.,00:01:00.800,00:01:02.743
"&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, any other suggestions?",00:01:02.743,00:01:05.645
"One-half, one-tenth, okay.",00:01:07.171,00:01:11.390
"Well, I don't want to get a reason for
each of those.",00:01:11.390,00:01:14.050
Is there any majority opinion on this?,00:01:14.050,00:01:16.510
&gt;&gt; 3.,00:01:17.640,00:01:18.850
"&gt;&gt; 3, that's a, why do you say 3?",00:01:18.850,00:01:21.618
&gt;&gt; Integers.,00:01:21.618,00:01:22.230
&gt;&gt; Integers.,00:01:27.120,00:01:27.980
"Okay, 0 is an integer.",00:01:27.980,00:01:29.270
Why 3?,00:01:30.270,00:01:30.840
Yeah?,00:01:32.374,00:01:33.276
"&gt;&gt; It's a value that
the Poisson could take.",00:01:33.276,00:01:35.207
"&gt;&gt; It's a value that
the Poisson could take, okay.",00:01:35.207,00:01:39.640
"But I don't have to list
them in order though,",00:01:39.640,00:01:42.750
I could have listed them out of order.,00:01:42.750,00:01:46.468
"All right, well, okay, a lot of you seem
to like the number 3, but I haven't yet",00:01:46.468,00:01:50.880
heard a good reason why.,00:01:50.880,00:01:52.800
I'm kind of interested.,00:01:52.800,00:01:53.832
"&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; It's an arithmetic sequence,",00:01:53.832,00:01:57.749
I hadn't noticed that.,00:01:57.749,00:01:59.270
"So I guess you're pointing out that it's
an arithmetic, hey that's pretty cool.",00:01:59.270,00:02:03.230
"So you go from here,
add one, add one, add-",00:02:03.230,00:02:05.725
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH],00:02:05.725,00:02:06.570
"&gt;&gt; Arithmetic sequence,",00:02:06.570,00:02:07.360
"okay, that might have been what
the puzzle writer had in mind.",00:02:07.360,00:02:11.530
"I've been trying to solve this for
the past couple days, I got stuck.",00:02:11.530,00:02:14.760
&gt;&gt; I haven't thought of 3 yet.,00:02:14.760,00:02:17.110
"The best answer I thought of so
far was 720 factorial.",00:02:17.110,00:02:20.605
"&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; We can debate a little bit,",00:02:20.605,00:02:25.590
is that more correct or is 3 more correct?,00:02:25.590,00:02:28.650
"Anyone,assuming it does goes this way,",00:02:30.645,00:02:33.190
"anyone wanna guess the next term
&gt;&gt; 3.",00:02:33.190,00:02:38.177
"&gt;&gt; 3 [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]",00:02:38.177,00:02:42.068
"All right, I think you got it.",00:02:44.730,00:02:47.330
"All right, so let me tell you why
I'm talking of this sequence.",00:02:47.330,00:02:50.850
"Well, it's probably just like,
I always really,",00:02:50.850,00:02:53.590
"I love puzzles since
the time I was little.",00:02:53.590,00:02:55.690
"But, I hated this kind of puzzle, because
there never seems to be a principle for",00:02:55.690,00:02:59.760
coming up with an answer.,00:02:59.760,00:03:00.620
"You can make up one,
I make up one thing and",00:03:00.620,00:03:02.710
"the answer is suppose
to be something else.",00:03:02.710,00:03:04.760
"Well, what's the measure,
what's the better, right?",00:03:04.760,00:03:07.340
"I mean, it's a measure of
maybe the simplest answer,",00:03:07.340,00:03:09.930
"but will two people always
agree on what's simpler.",00:03:09.930,00:03:13.350
"No, right,
you need some complexity measure or",00:03:13.350,00:03:16.030
"something to actually make that
into a valid, well-defined problem.",00:03:16.030,00:03:20.548
"So in a sense,
this is just as good an answer as 3,",00:03:20.548,00:03:23.190
"Some of you had a might an arithmetic
sequence, that's a good suggestion.",00:03:24.453,00:03:29.990
"But I was thinking of 0, well, 0 is 0.",00:03:29.990,00:03:35.440
"1 factorial, 2 factorial factorial,
3 factorial factorial factorial,",00:03:36.610,00:03:42.154
4 factorial factorial factorial factorial.,00:03:42.154,00:03:45.520
"Which one of you just
suggested it in thought.",00:03:45.520,00:03:49.170
"That's 0 with no factorials, 1 with
one factorial, 2 with two factorials,",00:03:49.170,00:03:53.864
etcetera.,00:03:53.864,00:03:54.560
"Okay, and probably should put parentheses,
but that's gonna,",00:03:55.800,00:03:59.290
"because this double factorial is also
used to mean the skip factorial,",00:03:59.290,00:04:02.920
"where you go down by
two numbers each time.",00:04:02.920,00:04:06.630
"But anyway, that's doing 3 factorial,
4 factorial, etcetera.",00:04:06.630,00:04:09.110
"All right, so, well I mean, that's
what one interpretation, it could be.",00:04:09.110,00:04:14.022
"So the general question is,",00:04:15.850,00:04:18.675
"if we have a sequence of numbers,
how do we extend it, okay?",00:04:18.675,00:04:24.760
"And I was thinking of this example cuz
I was thinking about factorials and",00:04:24.760,00:04:28.560
how I wanna explain standing factorials.,00:04:28.560,00:04:31.160
"So, like,
if you ever wondered what's pi factorial.",00:04:31.160,00:04:37.362
"We're gonna talk about
questions like that.",00:04:39.270,00:04:41.530
"If you didn't ever wonder
what pi factorial is,",00:04:42.590,00:04:45.240
"that's okay, you'll see other uses for
this kind of thing.",00:04:45.240,00:04:49.340
"The question is if you plot it, what
does the factorial function look like?",00:04:49.340,00:04:55.270
"Well, 0 factorial is 1.",00:04:55.270,00:04:59.210
That's 0.,00:04:59.210,00:05:00.060
1 factorial is 1.,00:05:00.060,00:05:02.380
2 factorial is 2.,00:05:02.380,00:05:03.800
3 factorial is 6.,00:05:03.800,00:05:07.011
4 factorial is 24.,00:05:07.011,00:05:08.990
5 factorial is 120.,00:05:08.990,00:05:11.148
6 factorial is 720.,00:05:11.148,00:05:12.828
Can't draw it anymore.,00:05:12.828,00:05:14.204
"It goes way, it starts out pretty small
and then it grows extremely fast.",00:05:14.204,00:05:19.650
"Very, very beautiful formula that
gives you the approximations for",00:05:20.700,00:05:23.870
"factorial is called Sterling's formula,",00:05:23.870,00:05:27.090
"which if you haven't seen before,
everyone should know this formula.",00:05:27.090,00:05:30.980
"It's both beautiful and useful,
says that n factorial is approximately",00:05:30.980,00:05:37.420
"square root of 2pi n
times n over e to the n.",00:05:37.420,00:05:41.510
"This is actually an extremely
good approximation.",00:05:43.790,00:05:46.310
"Even if you try this out on
a calculator where n is like 12 or 20,",00:05:46.310,00:05:50.690
"it's actually very, very good.",00:05:50.690,00:05:52.800
"Not only that, but
this approximation is so",00:05:54.440,00:05:56.650
"good that if you take the ratio of this,
divided by this, it will converge to 1.",00:05:56.650,00:06:02.480
As n goes to infinity.,00:06:02.480,00:06:03.680
"So, that gives you some,
that's just a cool looking formula.",00:06:05.070,00:06:07.820
"By the way,
we can prove this using probability and",00:06:07.820,00:06:10.910
"I'm not going to do that today,
but I might do that at some point.",00:06:10.910,00:06:13.290
"We can give this a probability
interpretation by thinking about",00:06:15.970,00:06:18.650
Poisson's.,00:06:18.650,00:06:19.850
"But anyway, this gives us some sense
of how fast does a factorial grow.",00:06:19.850,00:06:24.990
"This square root thing is not so
important.",00:06:24.990,00:06:27.350
"The main thing that's driving
is this n over e to the n.",00:06:27.350,00:06:30.260
"So basically we have
this n to the n behavior.",00:06:30.260,00:06:33.180
It's discounted by e to the n.,00:06:33.180,00:06:35.030
"But, n is, if you're letting n go to
infinity, that's dominating over the e.",00:06:35.030,00:06:42.200
"So anyway, that's Sterling's formula.",00:06:42.200,00:06:44.290
"So, that gives a sense
of how this thing grow.",00:06:45.540,00:06:47.890
"But now my question is,
how would you connect the dots?",00:06:47.890,00:06:51.090
"That is, if you want to, this function was
only defined on non-negative integers, and",00:06:51.090,00:06:55.280
if we want to interpolate.,00:06:55.280,00:06:57.178
"Well, it's like many ways you could draw
some function that connects those dots,",00:06:57.178,00:07:02.330
infinitely many ways to do it.,00:07:02.330,00:07:04.210
"The question is whether there's
some way that's more, so",00:07:04.210,00:07:07.430
if I ask you what's pi factorial?,00:07:07.430,00:07:09.750
"And you have as many ways as you want to
try to connect the dots between 3 and",00:07:09.750,00:07:14.674
"4, then what should you do?",00:07:14.674,00:07:16.880
"Well, it turns out that there's one
really standard famous way to do that.",00:07:16.880,00:07:21.960
"Some of you may have seen, but not at all,
I'm assuming that everyone has.",00:07:21.960,00:07:25.210
"That's called the gamma function, so
that's what we need to start with.",00:07:25.210,00:07:31.250
"We need the gamma function because
we're going to be introducing",00:07:31.250,00:07:35.130
something called the gamma distribution.,00:07:35.130,00:07:37.030
"We're not done with beta,
we were doing beta a lot last time, and",00:07:38.070,00:07:41.300
"hopefully it wasn't too scary,
despite it being Halloween.",00:07:41.300,00:07:45.150
"We'll come back to the,",00:07:45.150,00:07:46.010
"the beta turns out to be extremely
closely connected with the gamma.",00:07:46.010,00:07:48.990
"So to understand the beta, we need to
do the gamma, which we're about to do.",00:07:48.990,00:07:54.020
"The gamma distribution is named
the gamma distribution because",00:07:54.020,00:07:58.960
it stems from the gamma function which is-,00:07:58.960,00:08:02.820
"Which is one of the most famous
functions in all of mathematics.",00:08:02.820,00:08:06.740
"Like if you had a top ten list,
top ten most famous functions in math,",00:08:06.740,00:08:11.350
"gamma should, I haven't seen anyone
make quite a list like that.",00:08:12.470,00:08:16.420
"I've seen people make lists of
the ten most famous constants, but",00:08:16.420,00:08:19.970
not the ten most famous functions.,00:08:19.970,00:08:22.040
"I'm sure someone has, and
if they haven't, or if they have and",00:08:22.040,00:08:25.830
"they did a good job, they would put
the gamma function on the list, okay?",00:08:25.830,00:08:29.400
"So it's very, very important in math, not
just in probability and statistics, but",00:08:29.400,00:08:33.250
"it's also important in statistics,
which is why we need it right now, but",00:08:33.250,00:08:36.420
"it has its own life
outside of this subject.",00:08:36.420,00:08:38.932
"All right, so here's the definition
of the gamma function",00:08:38.932,00:08:42.100
"That's just a capital letter Gamma of
a is defined by the following integral.",00:08:44.097,00:08:52.320
"Integral, 0 to infinity,
x to the a E to the minus x, dx over x.",00:08:52.320,00:08:59.801
"Usually, you'll see it written as an x
to the a minus 1 here, which of course,",00:09:02.560,00:09:06.085
is the same thing.,00:09:06.085,00:09:06.940
Cuz you can cancel out one of the xs.,00:09:06.940,00:09:09.250
"But for certain reasons, it's convenient
keeping kind of one x on hold over here.",00:09:09.250,00:09:15.460
"Just a different way to write it,
but the same thing.",00:09:15.460,00:09:17.660
"And this is defined for
any real a greater than 0.",00:09:17.660,00:09:21.434
"[COUGH] If you try letting a equal zero
here or if you let a be negative and",00:09:25.228,00:09:30.216
"you think about how this integral is
gonna behave, it's not gonna behave well.",00:09:30.216,00:09:36.070
It's not gonna exist.,00:09:36.070,00:09:37.930
"So, for example, if a is zero,",00:09:37.930,00:09:39.510
"this part is gone,
we just have e to the minus x over x.",00:09:39.510,00:09:44.400
"And then like look at what
happens to that near 0, okay?",00:09:44.400,00:09:48.716
"So I'm not going to
rewrite the whole thing.",00:09:48.716,00:09:50.281
"Just pretend that the x to the a is
gone because we let a equal 0.",00:09:50.281,00:09:54.790
We just have this.,00:09:54.790,00:09:56.090
"Look at what happens when
x gets very close to 0,",00:09:56.090,00:09:59.560
"x is close to 0, either minus x is just
close to 1, so it's not doing much, right?",00:09:59.560,00:10:04.100
"Either 0 is 1, so this part is very
well behaved, it's just approximately 1,",00:10:04.100,00:10:07.837
nothing much going on.,00:10:07.837,00:10:09.300
"So what's driving the integral is this 1
over x, the integral of 1 over x is log x,",00:10:09.300,00:10:14.170
"log of 0 is minus infinity, and
that causes major problems.",00:10:14.170,00:10:21.180
"So, Anyway, but",00:10:21.180,00:10:25.722
"as long as a is greater than 0,
this is okay.",00:10:25.722,00:10:30.470
"Same argument,
what happens when x is near 0?",00:10:31.760,00:10:36.680
"Well, this e to the minus
x doesn't do very much.",00:10:36.680,00:10:40.070
"But here, we just have x to the a minus 1.",00:10:40.070,00:10:42.870
And integrating that is gonna be fine.,00:10:42.870,00:10:45.620
"You can just do the anti-derivative and
you'll see it converges.",00:10:45.620,00:10:49.080
So it's okay.,00:10:49.080,00:10:50.600
That's when x goes near 0.,00:10:50.600,00:10:52.140
"It's also, you also have to consider
what happens when it goes to infinity.",00:10:52.140,00:10:57.070
"When x goes to infinity either the minus
x is the dominate part ,this thing,",00:10:57.070,00:11:04.510
"even if a is a million,
than this would be x to the 999,999.",00:11:04.510,00:11:09.590
"Completely irrelevant compared to even
minus x, which is exponential decay.",00:11:09.590,00:11:14.710
So that integral is gonna converge.,00:11:14.710,00:11:17.100
"So okay, so it exists for
any real a greater than 0.",00:11:17.100,00:11:21.605
"This is an extension of
the factorial function.",00:11:23.340,00:11:26.410
"It will be a little bit more convenient
if gamma of a is a factorial.",00:11:26.410,00:11:31.159
"It turns out that gamma of
n is n minus 1 factorial.",00:11:31.159,00:11:35.887
"So you just have to be
a little bit careful.",00:11:35.887,00:11:39.560
"That's just for
historical reasons pretty much.",00:11:39.560,00:11:42.740
"This is for n, for
any n a positive integer.",00:11:44.960,00:11:48.550
"So as I said,",00:11:56.249,00:11:57.036
"there's other ways you can extend
factorials to the positive real numbers.",00:11:57.036,00:12:01.710
"But this one turns out to be the one
that has at least found the most",00:12:01.710,00:12:06.570
"different applications in math,
so this is the most natural and",00:12:06.570,00:12:10.010
best one known in a certain sense.,00:12:10.010,00:12:12.410
So why is this true?,00:12:14.050,00:12:17.720
"Well, let me write down
another identity for Gamma.",00:12:17.720,00:12:21.288
Gamma of x plus 1 equals x gamma x.,00:12:21.288,00:12:26.730
So this recursive formula for gamma.,00:12:28.200,00:12:30.500
"You don't need to know much about
the gamma function for this course.",00:12:30.500,00:12:35.750
"Depending on what kind of math you do
later, you might need a lot of gamma",00:12:35.750,00:12:40.210
"stuff, but for our purposes, you should
know the definition, you should know that",00:12:40.210,00:12:44.400
"it extends factorials in this way,
you should know this identity.",00:12:44.400,00:12:48.070
"Notice that this is very
closely related to this, right,",00:12:48.070,00:12:51.940
"because let's just look for
a second at gamma of 1.",00:12:51.940,00:12:55.920
"We let a equal 1, x is cancel,
integral of e to the minus x,",00:12:55.920,00:13:01.010
"we've seen several times that
that's just 1, so gamma 1 equals 1.",00:13:01.010,00:13:05.996
"And then if we plug that in here,",00:13:05.996,00:13:09.304
"it says that gamma of 2,
that's 1 plus 1 equals,",00:13:09.304,00:13:14.696
"gamma of 2 equals 1 gamma of 1,
which is 1.",00:13:14.696,00:13:19.870
"It would be nice if gamma
of 2 was 2 factorial, but",00:13:19.870,00:13:22.240
"according to this gamma of
2 its still 1 factorial.",00:13:22.240,00:13:24.450
"So that's still correct, gamma of 2 is 1.",00:13:24.450,00:13:26.910
"And now if we look at gamma of 3,
well we do 2 + 1, 2 gamma of 2,",00:13:26.910,00:13:31.850
"and we would get 2, and so on.",00:13:31.850,00:13:33.750
"So, notice that this is the same recursive
formula that the factorial will satisfy.",00:13:33.750,00:13:38.690
"So basically this formula immediately
implies this one just by,",00:13:38.690,00:13:43.700
"we have the starting point, right?",00:13:43.700,00:13:45.950
"And then both things, both factorials and",00:13:45.950,00:13:50.070
"gammas satisfy the same recursion, so
then they must stay the same forever.",00:13:50.070,00:13:54.280
"Okay, and to prove this thing
is just integration by parts,",00:13:55.740,00:14:01.390
which I'll let you do if you feel like it.,00:14:01.390,00:14:04.360
"If you tried to do this integral,",00:14:04.360,00:14:06.330
"just using kind of like the most basic
integration by parts, like AP calculus.",00:14:06.330,00:14:11.240
"What you would do is, you would not
just get an answer for the integral.",00:14:11.240,00:14:15.770
"But what you would get is something that
looks exactly like the gamma function",00:14:15.770,00:14:18.820
again and,00:14:18.820,00:14:19.540
"you would get this identity, just from
a straightforward integration by parts.",00:14:19.540,00:14:23.600
"Okay, so not the gamma function and
that's what happens for factorials.",00:14:25.220,00:14:31.649
"One other thing about the Gamma
function that's worth knowing",00:14:32.660,00:14:36.900
is what's gamma of one-half?,00:14:36.900,00:14:41.880
"Just in case you ever wonder what's
the factorial of negative one-half.",00:14:41.880,00:14:46.690
What does that mean?,00:14:46.690,00:14:47.576
"Well, gamma of one-half,
so when it's an integer,",00:14:47.576,00:14:52.482
we just get factorials which are integers.,00:14:52.482,00:14:56.870
Gamma of one half is square root of pi.,00:14:56.870,00:14:59.898
Kind of a curious looking fact.,00:15:02.889,00:15:05.450
"And where have we seen
square roots of pis before",00:15:05.450,00:15:08.610
Normalizing constant from the normal.,00:15:10.676,00:15:12.940
"So we proved that the normalizing
constant for the normal is we have",00:15:12.940,00:15:17.954
"1 over square root of 2 pi,
blah blah blah, for the normal PDF.",00:15:17.954,00:15:23.710
"So if you let a equal one half here,
it doesn't look exactly like the normal.",00:15:23.710,00:15:30.580
"But actually, it's similar to what
you would get if we have this normal,",00:15:30.580,00:15:38.460
"take our normal density, let's say,
e to the minus x squared over 2 dx.",00:15:39.480,00:15:43.530
"Let's say, we were just trying
to do that integral, right?",00:15:43.530,00:15:46.770
"And when we did this using the cool
trick of writing it down twice, we",00:15:46.770,00:15:52.010
"took into rule, couldn't do it wrote down
a second time and then we could do it.",00:15:52.010,00:15:55.250
"But if we didn't know that trick, we might
say, well, let's make a substitution.",00:15:55.250,00:16:00.350
"For example,",00:16:00.350,00:16:01.770
"I guess the most obvious thing to do
might to let u equal x squared over two.",00:16:01.770,00:16:07.360
"Right, so du = dx, right?",00:16:07.360,00:16:13.860
"And so, Sorry xdx.",00:16:13.860,00:16:18.071
"So, I mean that will be
one thing we can try.",00:16:20.408,00:16:24.710
This would be a natural thing to try.,00:16:24.710,00:16:27.040
"Just because it's kind of annoying having
this x squared up in the exponent.",00:16:27.040,00:16:31.970
"So if I do this then at least it's
just gonna be e to the minus u,",00:16:31.970,00:16:35.250
that's very nice up in the exponent.,00:16:35.250,00:16:38.720
But the problem is we don't actually,00:16:38.720,00:16:42.390
"have a x here, right?",00:16:44.840,00:16:49.700
"So you can still do the substitution,
but what you're gonna get is,",00:16:49.700,00:16:53.876
"you'll have an x there, and
x is essentially square root of u.",00:16:53.876,00:16:57.693
"I mean,
there's some other nonsense going on.",00:16:57.693,00:16:59.517
"So you're gonna get a square root of u,
which is like what you would have here,",00:16:59.517,00:17:04.635
"or you would be dividing
by square root of u.",00:17:04.635,00:17:07.520
"So anyway, I'm just saying.",00:17:07.520,00:17:09.180
"I mean, you can work through
the substitution if you want.",00:17:09.180,00:17:10.886
"But I'm just saying if you do this kind
of substitution on the normal integral.",00:17:10.886,00:17:14.580
"You're gonna reduce it to something
that looks like gamma of one half.",00:17:14.580,00:17:17.930
"So you could either think of
that as if you knew this fact,",00:17:17.930,00:17:21.680
"this would give you another way to get
the normalizing concept of the normal.",00:17:21.680,00:17:26.160
"Or, the way we actually have it is we
already know from a different method,",00:17:26.160,00:17:30.662
"the normalizing constant of the normal,
then we can prove this fact.",00:17:30.662,00:17:34.887
"So once we have gamma of one-half,
then we know gamma of three-halves.",00:17:34.887,00:17:38.865
(3/4) = one plus one-half.,00:17:42.233,00:17:46.590
"So if we use this formula,
just says it's 1/2 gamma of 1/2.",00:17:46.590,00:17:50.740
"So that would be square root of pi/2 and
so on.",00:17:50.740,00:17:55.003
"So, then we could get gamma of
five-halves, gamma of seven-halves and",00:17:55.003,00:17:59.672
get all the half integers that way.,00:17:59.672,00:18:01.945
"All right, so that's just a quick
introduction of the gamma function.",00:18:01.945,00:18:04.740
"What's on this board is all you need
to know about the gamma function.",00:18:05.750,00:18:09.303
"But now let's talk about the gamma
distribution to connect it back to",00:18:09.303,00:18:13.282
probability.,00:18:13.282,00:18:14.186
"Okay, so here's kind of a simple",00:18:14.186,00:18:20.689
naive way to create a PDF.,00:18:20.689,00:18:25.809
Based on the gamma function.,00:18:30.202,00:18:32.180
So we have this integral here.,00:18:32.180,00:18:34.078
"That's just the definition of gamma of a,
okay?",00:18:34.078,00:18:39.010
"And suppose we wanna somehow
guess that some kind of",00:18:39.010,00:18:44.201
"PDF that's gonna be related to the Gamma
function, and we want a valid PDF.",00:18:44.201,00:18:51.938
"And to have a valid PDF, all we need
is something that's non-negative and",00:18:51.938,00:18:55.975
integrates to one.,00:18:55.975,00:18:57.074
What would you do?,00:18:57.074,00:18:58.974
"Normalize it, how?",00:19:01.925,00:19:03.873
How would you normalize this thing?,00:19:08.554,00:19:09.957
"&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Just divide by that value.",00:19:12.322,00:19:16.840
"So if we divide both sides by gamma of a,
that's a PDF.",00:19:16.840,00:19:22.677
"So 1 = integral 0 to infinity,
1 over gamma of a,",00:19:22.677,00:19:28.113
"x to the a, e to the -x, dx/x, Right?",00:19:28.113,00:19:33.353
"That's what I call just like a simple
naive trick, that we have that integral.",00:19:33.353,00:19:37.880
"Just divide by gamma of
a now we have a PDF.",00:19:37.880,00:19:40.661
"So this thing here, Is called",00:19:40.661,00:19:45.936
"everything we're integrating, including
this 1/x it's easy to forget this 1/x.",00:19:45.936,00:19:51.347
"You could put it up there as x to the a-
1, but then it's easy to forget whether",00:19:51.347,00:19:55.307
"that should be a or a- 1,
I like to write it this way.",00:19:55.307,00:19:58.008
"This is called the Gamma of (a,1) PDF.",00:19:58.008,00:20:04.049
"There are two parameters,",00:20:08.772,00:20:10.704
"we only see the a right here
because the other parameters is 1.",00:20:10.704,00:20:15.160
"Gamma is very closely related
to exponential distribution.",00:20:15.160,00:20:18.946
"So the more general one
would be Gamma of a lambda,",00:20:18.946,00:20:23.830
"And that one would be obtained just by,",00:20:27.235,00:20:30.221
"remember how we got from exponential
one to any exponential lambda?",00:20:30.221,00:20:35.480
"It's the exact same idea that
we're just putting in a scale.",00:20:35.480,00:20:38.960
"So this is just a scale or
a one over is a scale.",00:20:38.960,00:20:45.910
"So to get this one we're just
gonna make a change of variables,",00:20:45.910,00:20:50.971
"let's say we wanted y to be gamma of
a lambda and we wanna find it's PDF.",00:20:50.971,00:20:56.719
"Then we're gonna define it as, Y =,",00:20:56.719,00:21:01.681
"this is exact same thing we did for
the exponential.",00:21:01.681,00:21:05.893
"We're just gonna let y
equal x over lambda.",00:21:05.893,00:21:08.880
"We just defined gamma of (a,1).",00:21:08.880,00:21:12.157
"That's what we just defined as this PDF,
and now we want gamma of",00:21:14.490,00:21:18.552
"a lambda all we're gonna do is take
a gamma (a,1) divide by lambda, okay?",00:21:18.552,00:21:23.535
"And so now at this point,",00:21:23.535,00:21:25.446
"this is just like a really
simple transformation, right?",00:21:25.446,00:21:30.010
"Just multiplying by a constant,",00:21:30.010,00:21:31.570
"and we've been talking about what happens
with more complicated transformations,",00:21:31.570,00:21:35.587
"non-linear stuff and
all kinds of complicated transformations.",00:21:35.587,00:21:38.780
Here we're just multiplying by a constant.,00:21:38.780,00:21:41.840
"So if want the PDF of Y just to remind
you of your change of variables.",00:21:41.840,00:21:47.420
"The PDF of Y is fx(x) dx/dy, right?",00:21:47.420,00:21:54.940
"And in this case we
have y = x over lambda,",00:21:54.940,00:21:58.952
"which we could of course
write as x = lambda y.",00:21:58.952,00:22:03.434
So dx/dy = lambda.,00:22:03.434,00:22:08.097
"So we just right down the gamma PDF,",00:22:10.420,00:22:15.179
"and we just replace x by, x is lambda y,",00:22:15.179,00:22:20.412
"so I'm just replacing x by lambda y,",00:22:20.412,00:22:25.329
"to the a, e to the- lambda y, 1/x.",00:22:25.329,00:22:30.424
And x is lambda y.,00:22:30.424,00:22:31.692
"Times lambda, so
that lambda cancels that lambda.",00:22:34.358,00:22:38.196
And that's what it looks like.,00:22:40.140,00:22:42.710
"I should emphasize the possible values,
this is for x greater than 0,",00:22:42.710,00:22:47.066
this one is for y greater than 0.,00:22:47.066,00:22:49.110
"So this is like the exponential,",00:22:49.110,00:22:52.770
"that gamma is a continuous distribution
on the positive real numbers, okay?",00:22:52.770,00:22:58.190
"So, I mean that's just, all right,
so that's a cute trick,",00:22:59.938,00:23:04.657
"how do we get to convert this famous
function into a distribution.",00:23:04.657,00:23:09.940
"That doesn't really say that that's gonna
be an important distribution, right?",00:23:09.940,00:23:13.647
That's not like a math trick story.,00:23:13.647,00:23:16.860
"It's not a probabilistic or
statistical story.",00:23:16.860,00:23:19.680
"So I wanna show you now how
this relates to the gamma, no,",00:23:19.680,00:23:23.543
"the gamma distribution relates to
the exponential distribution, okay?",00:23:23.543,00:23:28.630
"That's why we use the letter lambda and
this is analogous to what we did for",00:23:28.630,00:23:32.970
"the exponential, so
why does that work out?",00:23:32.970,00:23:35.640
So for that we just need a picture.,00:23:37.100,00:23:38.430
"That's actually related
to the Poisson also.",00:23:42.878,00:23:45.230
"Gamma relates to the normal
distribution we'll see later.",00:23:45.230,00:23:48.580
"It relates to the beta distribution, it
relates to the exponential distribution,",00:23:48.580,00:23:52.225
it relates to the Poisson distribution.,00:23:52.225,00:23:54.037
"And by the way, so we've already
discussed all the famous discreet",00:23:54.037,00:23:58.698
distributions we need in this course.,00:23:58.698,00:24:01.408
"We're almost done with continuous
distributions as well.",00:24:01.408,00:24:04.570
"Not done like studying them,",00:24:04.570,00:24:06.100
"but done with like famous ones
that You need to know by name.",00:24:06.100,00:24:10.270
"There's a few more, but all of
the remaining ones are just variations",00:24:10.270,00:24:15.980
"in some sense of Gammas or
possibly with normals.",00:24:15.980,00:24:21.940
"But as you'll see later,
Gamma is closely related to normal.",00:24:21.940,00:24:24.700
So once we have the Gamma and,00:24:24.700,00:24:25.730
"the normal, we can create the rest
of the distributions we'll need.",00:24:25.730,00:24:30.540
"So to talk about the Gamma,
and Exponential connection,",00:24:33.270,00:24:38.090
we need to think about a Poisson process.,00:24:40.760,00:24:44.160
"Okay, so, we've only talked a little
bit about Poisson processes.",00:24:49.975,00:24:54.010
"Which is if you take that, 71,",00:24:54.010,00:24:55.718
"which is processes you can do
a lot of Poisson process stuff.",00:24:55.718,00:24:59.510
"For our purposes we just need
to know a couple basic facts.",00:24:59.510,00:25:03.760
First of all what is a Poisson process?,00:25:03.760,00:25:06.429
"You've seen them before, but",00:25:06.429,00:25:08.143
"just to quickly remind you we're
imagining emails arriving in an inbox.",00:25:08.143,00:25:13.250
"Where the number of emails in some
time interval let's say N sub t",00:25:13.250,00:25:19.940
"equals number of emails up to time
t we just have this timeline here.",00:25:19.940,00:25:26.900
"And the Poisson process is called
a Poisson process because we're assuming",00:25:30.810,00:25:34.010
"that that's Poisson with rate lambda,
lambda times t.",00:25:34.010,00:25:40.650
"So in a time interval of length t,
this is true,",00:25:40.650,00:25:45.590
"I stated this as you know
you're going from zero to t.",00:25:45.590,00:25:48.510
"But we're actually assuming that this is
true in any time interval of length t,",00:25:48.510,00:25:53.410
it's gonna be Poisson lambda t.,00:25:53.410,00:25:55.030
"And there's only one other assumption for
a Poisson process,",00:25:55.030,00:26:00.141
"that is that the number of arrivals in
disjoint intervals are independent.",00:26:00.141,00:26:06.321
"That is the number of emails you get from
this time to this time is independent of",00:26:06.321,00:26:10.153
"the number of emails you get from
this time to this time for example.",00:26:10.153,00:26:13.480
"So those,
there are only those two assumptions.",00:26:15.990,00:26:19.210
"So a few weeks ago we
saw what the connection",00:26:24.692,00:26:27.824
with the exponential distribution is.,00:26:27.824,00:26:30.787
"And that was before we had even
defined the exponential distribution.",00:26:30.787,00:26:34.170
"So, I'll remind you of what that was.",00:26:34.170,00:26:38.160
"So, we're just drawing Draw an x
every time you got an email.",00:26:38.160,00:26:47.950
"That kind of picture,
that is the picture we have in mind.",00:26:49.190,00:26:53.120
"So what we proved a week ago was
that if we call this one T1,",00:26:53.120,00:26:59.231
"T1 is the time of the first email,
that's exponential lambda.",00:26:59.231,00:27:05.180
"And the proof for that is just to say,
Just to remind you,",00:27:06.430,00:27:12.087
"what's the probability
that T1 is greater than t?",00:27:12.087,00:27:16.580
"That's the same thing as saying at time t,
I haven't yet gotten any email.",00:27:16.580,00:27:23.020
"That's the same thing as
saying that N sub t equals 0,",00:27:23.020,00:27:26.895
"cuz that's just the same thing,
no emails up until time t.",00:27:26.895,00:27:31.120
"Well, that's just given by
Poisson e to the minus lambda t.",00:27:31.120,00:27:36.299
The rest of the Poisson stuff is just 1.,00:27:38.891,00:27:41.210
"So it's just this one line calculation
that shows that, and then say that's just",00:27:42.220,00:27:46.690
"one minus the exponential lambda CDF so
that's true.",00:27:46.690,00:27:53.160
So this first time is exponential.,00:27:53.160,00:27:55.770
"Using a similar argument we get that
that's the time from here to here.",00:27:56.770,00:28:02.110
"Using the same argument repeatedly,
The time you have",00:28:02.110,00:28:07.384
"to wait from the first email to the second
email is also gonna be an exponential and",00:28:07.384,00:28:12.028
it's independent of the first exponential.,00:28:12.028,00:28:15.380
Just use the memoryless property.,00:28:15.380,00:28:16.880
"Memoryless property says,
no matter how long you've waited,",00:28:19.390,00:28:24.250
"waiting for this second email but
starting at this point in time",00:28:24.250,00:28:29.140
"it's just starting over again so
it's just the same problem again.",00:28:29.140,00:28:31.770
"Same method says that here to here
is another exponential lambda, and",00:28:33.030,00:28:38.280
"from here to here is
an exponential lambda.",00:28:38.280,00:28:41.040
"Exponential lambda, and so on.",00:28:41.040,00:28:43.820
"So all of these times between
arrivals are exponential lambda.",00:28:45.020,00:28:50.050
"So our assumption, so",00:28:50.050,00:28:51.420
"that's actually an equivalent way
to state the Poisson process.",00:28:51.420,00:28:54.320
"Rather than stating with Poisson,
we could say that the inter-arrival times,",00:28:54.320,00:28:58.349
"that is just these distances
between Xs and this timeline,",00:28:59.490,00:29:03.292
"interarrival times, Are i.i.d.",00:29:03.292,00:29:09.899
Exponential lambda.,00:29:12.626,00:29:15.842
So those are the inter-arrival times.,00:29:18.029,00:29:22.060
"But what if we wanted to
know the actual times?",00:29:22.060,00:29:27.800
"So if we call this T2 and
T3, T4, T5, and so on.",00:29:27.800,00:29:31.860
"Well, that's the actual
time on the timeline,",00:29:33.880,00:29:36.270
not just the distance between two times.,00:29:36.270,00:29:39.680
We want to know that distribution.,00:29:39.680,00:29:41.030
So therefore we can think of Tn So,00:29:42.190,00:29:47.263
"let's define Tn to be
the time of the nth arrival,",00:29:47.263,00:29:50.898
"nth email, nth phone call, or whatever.",00:29:54.389,00:29:57.010
"We can think of that, to get Tn, we
just add up the first waiting time, then",00:30:00.290,00:30:05.940
"the waiting time from the first to the
second, and a second to third, and so on.",00:30:05.940,00:30:09.480
"So we can just think of that as
the sum of Xj, j equals 1 to n,",00:30:09.480,00:30:14.330
"where these Xj's are these
inter-arrival times,",00:30:14.330,00:30:18.670
"which we just said are exponential lambda,
i.i.d.",00:30:18.670,00:30:24.040
"This is the most important story for
the Gamma distribution, at least for",00:30:26.120,00:30:31.010
the integer.,00:30:31.010,00:30:31.940
So right now I'm assuming n is an integer.,00:30:31.940,00:30:34.170
"Over here,
a did not need to be an integer.",00:30:34.170,00:30:36.620
"But if we assume that it is an integer,",00:30:36.620,00:30:41.262
then this is gonna be Gamma of n lambda.,00:30:41.262,00:30:46.060
"We haven't shown this yet, so that's
something we need to prove, that this kind",00:30:50.709,00:30:55.551
"of a sum of i.i.d exponentials will be
Gamma, that's what we're gonna show next.",00:30:55.551,00:31:00.619
"But they can see the analogy, remember
the negative binomial and the geometric?",00:31:01.710,00:31:08.600
"The geometric you're waiting for
one success in discrete time.",00:31:08.600,00:31:11.630
"Negative binomial you're waiting for
however many you know,",00:31:11.630,00:31:15.100
"seven success say, right.",00:31:15.100,00:31:16.600
"If you can think of the negative binomial
as the sum of geometric, so you wait for",00:31:16.600,00:31:20.170
"your first success, then you wait for
your second, and then third.",00:31:20.170,00:31:23.290
"And so on, in discrete time.",00:31:23.290,00:31:26.630
"The exponential is the continuous
time analog of the geometric.",00:31:26.630,00:31:30.290
"So this is the continuous time
analog of negative binomial.",00:31:31.860,00:31:35.830
"How long do you have to wait for
n successes in continuous time?",00:31:35.830,00:31:40.550
"Where in this case,
success just means getting an email.",00:31:42.140,00:31:44.760
"So that's a pretty weak
definition of success.",00:31:44.760,00:31:47.200
"But anyway, that's what's going on.",00:31:47.200,00:31:51.065
"&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So",00:31:51.065,00:31:51.636
"success is however you
wanted to define it.",00:31:51.636,00:31:56.100
"But in this case,
we just mean the arrivals.",00:31:56.100,00:31:57.720
"All right, so let's prove this fact now
because just from what I've written,",00:31:58.950,00:32:03.860
"I'm saying this is true, but just from
what I've written here, here I said add up",00:32:03.860,00:32:07.960
"exponentials, and here I said Write
down this PDF with the Gamma function.",00:32:07.960,00:32:13.450
What does that have to do with that?,00:32:13.450,00:32:15.570
"Not yet clear, right?",00:32:15.570,00:32:16.970
"So we need to check the best true, okay?",00:32:16.970,00:32:20.790
So let's do that.,00:32:22.020,00:32:23.630
"There's two ways to do it, at least two.",00:32:24.870,00:32:26.890
"There's two ways that we
know how to do right now.",00:32:26.890,00:32:29.419
One would be to do a convolution.,00:32:30.830,00:32:33.410
"So, that thing over there is
just a convolution, right?",00:32:35.880,00:32:42.034
"This is a convolution,
it's just adding up an IID exponential.",00:32:42.034,00:32:45.820
We could do a convolution integral.,00:32:45.820,00:32:49.280
You could do that for practice.,00:32:49.280,00:32:51.170
"It's not that bad,
actually stuff will cancel and",00:32:51.170,00:32:53.790
"it's not bad, and
then you could involve X1 and X2.",00:32:53.790,00:32:58.040
"Then take that thing and involve it
with X3, and then take that thing and",00:32:59.200,00:33:03.195
"involve it with X4, or you get pretty
tired of it pretty quick soon.",00:33:03.195,00:33:07.011
"But hopefully before you got tired of it,
you would see a pattern and",00:33:07.011,00:33:10.283
you could prove it by induction.,00:33:10.283,00:33:12.870
But I don't wanna do it that way.,00:33:12.870,00:33:14.520
"We have a much better method
available that is MGFs, okay?",00:33:14.520,00:33:18.700
"MGF, right,
because we're adding up IID things.",00:33:18.700,00:33:26.506
"And in class, we already derived
the MGF of an exponential.",00:33:26.506,00:33:29.520
"It's a nice looking thing, and so
we may as well use that, okay?",00:33:29.520,00:33:34.600
"So that's what we're
gonna prove right now.",00:33:34.600,00:33:36.700
"So a proof that, Proof that,",00:33:37.750,00:33:43.265
"let's say T = the sum XJ,",00:33:43.265,00:33:47.234
J = 1 to N with XJ IID exponential lambda.,00:33:47.234,00:33:53.744
"Let's do exponential one first,
is Gamma of (n,1).",00:33:55.954,00:34:02.260
"As long as we can do this when lambda
is 1, then we immediately get this for",00:34:02.260,00:34:07.750
"all lambda, because you could just
multiply or divide by lamdba.",00:34:07.750,00:34:10.990
"Lambda was just a rescaling, and
so just scale everything later.",00:34:10.990,00:34:14.510
"It's not really harder to do it with
general lambda here, it just makes",00:34:15.590,00:34:18.730
"the notation more cluttered, having all
these lambdas floating around everywhere.",00:34:18.730,00:34:22.480
"So I'd rather just set it equal to 1,
and then we can always multiply or",00:34:22.480,00:34:26.024
divide by lambda later.,00:34:26.024,00:34:27.276
It's not a big deal.,00:34:27.276,00:34:28.040
"All right, so let's do that using the MGF.",00:34:29.610,00:34:31.960
"So the MGF of XJ,",00:34:33.070,00:34:35.169
"MGF of X1, since they're our IID,
they all have the same MGF.",00:34:39.410,00:34:43.967
It's the same as MGF of X2 and all XJs is.,00:34:43.967,00:34:50.045
"It's just 1 over 1- T, Which we can
also think of as a geometric series.",00:34:50.045,00:34:59.250
"So we used this before to
get all the moments of X1,",00:34:59.250,00:35:02.870
all at once using the geometric series.,00:35:02.870,00:35:05.590
"And this is valid for T less than 1, Okay?",00:35:05.590,00:35:11.580
"So we did that before, Therefore,",00:35:11.580,00:35:15.820
We can write down the MGF of T.,00:35:20.271,00:35:21.980
"I'll call it Tn,
just as a reminder that there's n of them.",00:35:21.980,00:35:29.371
"MGF of Tn, easy just raise
this to the nth power, right?",00:35:29.371,00:35:33.100
"Cuz we're adding independent things and
multiply the MGF.",00:35:33.100,00:35:35.915
"So just multiply that by
itself a bunch of times,",00:35:35.915,00:35:39.810
"we'd have 1 over 1- t to the n,
where t less than 1, okay?",00:35:39.810,00:35:44.753
Very little work required to do that.,00:35:44.753,00:35:46.620
I just put an n there.,00:35:46.620,00:35:48.590
"That's a lot easier than
doing a convolution.",00:35:48.590,00:35:50.170
"On the other hand, how do we know
that this is the MGF we wanted?",00:35:51.840,00:36:00.590
"Well, to answer that question,",00:36:00.590,00:36:04.475
"we need to look at the MGF of
a Gamma distribution, right?",00:36:04.475,00:36:11.284
"I'll make a new notation just so
that I'm not doing circular reasoning.",00:36:11.284,00:36:15.126
"Well, let's just say Y.",00:36:15.126,00:36:20.070
"Let Y be Gamma of n1, and
let's find its MGF, okay?",00:36:20.070,00:36:26.650
"And we said before that there's no
masquerading distributions that pretend to",00:36:26.650,00:36:31.628
"have a certain MGF and aren't actually
what they appear to be, right?",00:36:31.628,00:36:36.430
"So if, in fact, Y has this as its MGF,
then we're done, right?",00:36:36.430,00:36:41.750
"So that's what we need to show,
so find its MGF.",00:36:41.750,00:36:45.924
"Well, its MGF is the expected value,
e to the TY = LOTUS.",00:36:45.924,00:36:52.590
"I'm just gonna write e to the ty, And",00:36:53.860,00:36:57.979
"then I'm gonna write down
the gamma PDF which was,",00:36:57.979,00:37:03.401
"I'll take out the constant,
1 over Gamma of a.",00:37:03.401,00:37:08.583
"Y to the a, e to the -y, and a is n here.",00:37:08.583,00:37:15.690
"So that's Gamma of n, y to the n,",00:37:17.170,00:37:21.822
"e to the -y, dy over y.",00:37:21.822,00:37:25.157
"That's just this thing, and
just using LOTUS, okay?",00:37:30.148,00:37:34.830
"So that's not even conditioned,
write down, right away.",00:37:34.830,00:37:38.570
That's why it's LOTUSed.,00:37:38.570,00:37:40.210
"It shouldn't require much thought
to write this down, okay.",00:37:40.210,00:37:43.830
"Now, it may take some thought.",00:37:43.830,00:37:45.090
How do we actually do this integral?,00:37:45.090,00:37:47.620
"Well, I guess we can
simplify a little bit.",00:37:53.038,00:37:56.410
Collect these two terms.,00:37:56.410,00:37:58.610
"So this is really just 1 over Gamma of n,",00:37:58.610,00:38:04.039
"integral 0 to infinity,
y to the n, e to the minus.",00:38:04.039,00:38:11.083
"And let's just collect
these terms together,",00:38:11.083,00:38:14.035
"1- T, Times y, dy over y.",00:38:14.035,00:38:21.162
"Cuz we have e to the -y and
we have e to the TY, okay?",00:38:23.641,00:38:27.118
"All right, so
that may look like a difficult integral.",00:38:27.118,00:38:31.620
"But on the other hand,
if you stare at it for",00:38:31.620,00:38:37.530
"a little while,
it should start to look familiar.",00:38:37.530,00:38:40.638
"It kind of looks pretty similar to
the integrals we've just been doing.",00:38:40.638,00:38:45.488
"And it has some extra constant up here,
but",00:38:45.488,00:38:48.658
"this should seem pretty reminiscent
of the Gamma function itself, right?",00:38:48.658,00:38:54.755
"I mean just in general in this course,
it's not really a big deal how good",00:38:54.755,00:39:01.140
"you are at integration by parts and stuff
like that, you'll rarely have to do that.",00:39:01.140,00:39:06.110
"But what you do need to be able to do
is pattern recognition and see well,",00:39:06.110,00:39:10.160
this looks like a Gamma integral.,00:39:10.160,00:39:12.132
"it's just I have this extra constant here,
that's really no big deal, right?",00:39:12.132,00:39:15.900
"Just make a change of variables just
to make this e to the -x again, right?",00:39:15.900,00:39:21.950
"So we're just gonna let, x = (1-t)y.",00:39:21.950,00:39:29.965
"So that dx = (1-t)dy, Okay?",00:39:33.716,00:39:43.414
"So t is less than 1,",00:39:44.690,00:39:49.500
"so that means that this is
actually still positive.",00:39:49.500,00:39:52.850
"So the limits of integration, so now,
let's just rewrite that integral.",00:39:52.850,00:39:57.299
"So I'm just making a change of variables
just to make that e to the -x again,",00:39:57.299,00:40:00.414
cuz that's gonna look more like.,00:40:00.414,00:40:02.100
"It looks very similar to a Gamma, now,",00:40:02.100,00:40:03.590
"let's just make extremely similar,
that's all I'm doing.",00:40:03.590,00:40:06.880
So we do 1 over gamma of a.,00:40:08.760,00:40:10.448
"Limits of integration stay 0 to infinity,
because when Y is 0,",00:40:10.448,00:40:15.463
"X is 0, and one goes to infinity,
the other goes to infinity.",00:40:15.463,00:40:21.280
"And y to the n is just well,",00:40:21.280,00:40:26.650
"y is x over 1- t, so
we are gonna get 1- t to the -n.",00:40:26.650,00:40:32.280
"That looks pretty promising, right,",00:40:32.280,00:40:33.770
"cuz that's actually exactly
what we wanted over there.",00:40:33.770,00:40:36.560
"And then we're gonna have x to the n,
e to the -x.",00:40:38.030,00:40:42.533
"And one convenient thing about
kind of keeping this as dy over y,",00:40:44.782,00:40:48.222
instead of cancelling it.,00:40:48.222,00:40:49.698
"Is that this multiplicative
thing is gonna cancel,",00:40:49.698,00:40:52.739
"so dy over y is actually
the same thing as dx over x.",00:40:52.739,00:40:55.790
"That actually makes this
kind of thing easier.",00:40:55.790,00:40:58.230
"And that is again gamma of n,
not gamma of a, or just let a equal n.",00:41:00.340,00:41:05.310
"So that's why it's handy,
dy over y is same thing as dx over x,",00:41:05.310,00:41:09.948
"just makes it a little bit
easier with the algebra.",00:41:09.948,00:41:14.280
"Well, that was exactly the gamma function
again, so that's just 1- t to the -n,",00:41:14.280,00:41:18.342
which is what we wanted.,00:41:18.342,00:41:19.557
It's the same thing.,00:41:22.707,00:41:24.440
"MGF is the same, so that proves
that this statement is true, okay?",00:41:24.440,00:41:33.188
"So that's nice,
that's the connection with the,",00:41:33.188,00:41:38.864
"that's the connection
with the exponential.",00:41:38.864,00:41:44.030
"Well, another thing we need
to do is get the moments.",00:41:45.040,00:41:48.890
"So again, that sounds like
it could be a nasty problem,",00:41:48.890,00:41:53.966
"but it actually is not bad at all,
once you see the pattern.",00:41:53.966,00:41:59.370
"Okay, so let's let",00:41:59.370,00:42:04.491
X ~ Gamma(a1).,00:42:04.491,00:42:09.789
"And by the way, this calculation here
actually, in this last line here,",00:42:09.789,00:42:15.061
"in this part, I actually never assumed
that n was actually an integer.",00:42:15.061,00:42:20.520
"So this actually shows that
this is the correct MGF,",00:42:20.520,00:42:23.709
"even if n could be any
positive real number here.",00:42:23.709,00:42:27.130
"To have the interpretation of the sum of
the exponentials, then we need an integer.",00:42:27.130,00:42:31.220
"But this is the MGF in general,",00:42:31.220,00:42:33.245
"cuz that didn't rely on
assuming that was an integer.",00:42:33.245,00:42:37.820
"All right, so now let's get some moments.",00:42:37.820,00:42:41.330
"Of course we can use the MGF,
but actually,",00:42:41.330,00:42:44.262
"I think in this case it's even
easier just to directly use LOTUS.",00:42:44.262,00:42:48.631
So let's say we want to,00:42:48.631,00:42:54.009
find E(X to the C).,00:42:54.009,00:42:59.109
Where I don't even need for,00:42:59.109,00:43:02.760
"c to be an integer, c is just some number.",00:43:02.760,00:43:08.325
"I'm not saying this will exist for all c,
we'll have to see whether it exists,",00:43:08.325,00:43:13.216
"okay, but c is just any constant.",00:43:13.216,00:43:15.333
"In particular,
we can let c = 1 to get the mean,",00:43:15.333,00:43:18.451
"c = 2 to get the second moment,
then we can get the variance of that.",00:43:18.451,00:43:22.880
"Well, it's just LOTUS, so
this should be pretty quick.",00:43:23.990,00:43:27.812
"I'm gonna write down the,
I want E(X to the c),",00:43:27.812,00:43:33.301
"change big X to little x,
just LOTUS, right, X to the C.",00:43:33.301,00:43:39.591
"And then then I'm just gonna write
down the gamma PDF again, right?",00:43:39.591,00:43:44.220
"So we had 1 over Gamma(a), x to the c, and",00:43:44.220,00:43:49.017
"then we had an x to the a,
e to the minus x, dx over x.",00:43:49.017,00:43:54.619
"Well okay, obviously we can combine",00:43:56.731,00:44:01.761
"this to be X to the a + c, 0, infinity,",00:44:01.761,00:44:07.274
"x to the a + c, e to the -x dx over x.",00:44:07.274,00:44:12.160
"That integral should look very,
very familiar again, right?",00:44:13.320,00:44:18.011
"Just pattern recognition, that's x
to a power, e to the -x dx over x.",00:44:18.011,00:44:23.481
"That looks very very much like
the gamma function again, right?",00:44:23.481,00:44:28.460
"That is the gamma function,
that's just Gamma(a + c) over Gamma(a).",00:44:28.460,00:44:34.182
That's just the gamma function.,00:44:38.615,00:44:40.150
"Or if you want, you can multiply and
divide by Gamma(a + c) and",00:44:40.150,00:44:43.846
"say, we just integrated
the Gamma(a + c) PDF.",00:44:43.846,00:44:47.180
"Must get 1,
if it's a PDF it has to integrate to 1.",00:44:47.180,00:44:50.543
"So you don't need to do any calculus here,
really, that was just algebra.",00:44:50.543,00:44:56.608
"This times this, and
then recognizing that's a gamma, right?",00:44:56.608,00:45:00.830
"So gamma has very,",00:45:00.830,00:45:02.540
"very nice properties in that sense,
beta has some similar nice properties.",00:45:02.540,00:45:07.832
"All right, so
that's Gamma(a + c) over Gamma(a).",00:45:07.832,00:45:10.700
"And our assumption has to
that a + c is positive,",00:45:10.700,00:45:15.420
"because the gamma function is
only defined on positive numbers.",00:45:16.880,00:45:21.498
"If a + c less than or equal to 0,
then it just doesn't exist.",00:45:21.498,00:45:25.730
"So okay, let's use this just
to just quickly get the mean.",00:45:27.630,00:45:31.080
"E(X) =, now let's just let c = 1,",00:45:32.860,00:45:38.320
"so that's gonna be Gamma(a
+ 1) over Gamma(a).",00:45:38.320,00:45:45.938
"But then remember that identity,
Gamma(a+1) is a Gamma(a).",00:45:45.938,00:45:52.879
"So this is a Gamma(a) over Gamma(a),
which is just simplifies to a.",00:45:52.879,00:45:59.550
"Very easy-looking formula for the mean,",00:46:01.330,00:46:03.933
"now let's check whether this
makes sense intuitively.",00:46:03.933,00:46:07.411
"In the case when a is an integer, and",00:46:07.411,00:46:09.697
"we use that interpretation over there,
we already knew the answer, right?",00:46:09.697,00:46:14.750
"Cuz exponential 1 has mean 1,
you add up n of them,",00:46:14.750,00:46:18.271
you have to get mean n by linearity.,00:46:18.271,00:46:21.240
"So we already knew this is
correct in the integer case, and",00:46:21.240,00:46:25.111
"this says it's true even
if a is not an integer.",00:46:25.111,00:46:28.281
"All right, and
let's get the second moment, E(x squared).",00:46:28.281,00:46:33.840
"Well, that's just Gamma(a
+ 2) over Gamma(a).",00:46:33.840,00:46:38.380
"Gamma(a + 2) is (a + 1) Gamma(a),
(a + 1) Gamma(a + 1).",00:46:42.515,00:46:48.930
"I'm just using the same thing again,
right?",00:46:48.930,00:46:51.880
"Just replace a by (a + 1), so
it's (a + 1) Gamma(a + 1).",00:46:51.880,00:46:56.000
"But gamma of (a + 1) is a Gamma(a),
so again, the Gamma(a)'s cancel.",00:46:56.000,00:47:01.940
"And we would just get a squared + a,
and that tells us the variance.",00:47:03.210,00:47:08.243
"Variance is E(X squared)
minus E(X) squared, so",00:47:08.243,00:47:13.000
"we're subtracting a squared, so that
tells us the variance of x also equals a.",00:47:13.000,00:47:18.860
"Again, that's easy to remember.",00:47:21.730,00:47:22.949
"So it says that Gamma(a + 1)
has mean a and variance a.",00:47:22.949,00:47:29.113
"Sounds a little like the Poisson,
where the mean equals the variance.",00:47:29.113,00:47:33.110
"But this is kind of a special,
for the Poisson,",00:47:33.110,00:47:36.010
the mean is always equal to the variance.,00:47:36.010,00:47:38.350
"And this is kind of,
just because I let lambda equal 1.",00:47:38.350,00:47:42.117
"So now if we bring back the lambda,
gamma of a lambda.",00:47:42.117,00:47:48.723
"Well to get that, we define that just
by rescaling, by dividing by lambda.",00:47:48.723,00:47:55.266
"So gama of a lambda has
mean a over lambda, but",00:47:55.266,00:48:00.531
"the variance becomes
a over lambda squared.",00:48:00.531,00:48:05.809
"Because remember, when you multiply by
a constant, remember, when you multiply by",00:48:05.809,00:48:10.777
"a constant and you take the variance,
then the constant comes out squared.",00:48:10.777,00:48:15.230
"So gamma a lambda has this mean and
this variance.",00:48:15.230,00:48:18.130
"But notice that it was just easier to
do this thing with lambda = 1 first,",00:48:18.130,00:48:23.243
"as long as we don't forget at
the end to bring back the lambda.",00:48:23.243,00:48:27.552
"All right, so this is just kind of an
introduction to the gamma distribution and",00:48:27.552,00:48:33.530
"the gamma function,
how it connects with the exponential.",00:48:33.530,00:48:37.510
"Next time, I'll show you how it
connects to the beta and the normal.",00:48:37.510,00:48:40.760
"Thought we'd finish
a little bit early today,",00:48:40.760,00:48:43.060
"cuz I don't wanna scare you again
with the beta til next time.",00:48:43.060,00:48:46.630
See you on Friday.,00:48:46.630,00:48:47.172
