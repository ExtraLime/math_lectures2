PROFESSOR: OK.,00:00:20.980,00:00:21.890
Let's start.,00:00:21.890,00:00:24.330
"So last lecture, what we
talked about was limitations",00:00:24.330,00:00:30.470
"of classical
statistical mechanics,",00:00:30.470,00:00:33.280
"and what I will
contrast with what",00:00:33.280,00:00:37.180
"I will talk about today,
which is new version.",00:00:37.180,00:00:41.860
"The old version of
quantum mechanics,",00:00:41.860,00:00:45.320
"which was based on the
observation originally from",00:00:45.320,00:00:48.770
"Planck, and then
expanded by Einstein,",00:00:48.770,00:00:51.680
"that for a harmonic
oscillator, a frequency omega,",00:00:51.680,00:01:01.220
"the energies cannot
take all values.",00:01:01.220,00:01:05.850
"But values that are multiples of
the frequency of the oscillator",00:01:05.850,00:01:11.010
and then some integer n.,00:01:11.010,00:01:13.220
"What we did with
this observation",00:01:17.094,00:01:19.890
"to extract thermal
properties was to simply say",00:01:19.890,00:01:23.820
"that we will
construct a partition",00:01:23.820,00:01:25.600
"function for the
harmonic oscillator",00:01:25.600,00:01:28.870
"by summing over all of the
states of e to the minus beta e",00:01:28.870,00:01:34.382
"n according to the
formula given above.",00:01:34.382,00:01:38.860
"Just thinking that
these are allowed states",00:01:38.860,00:01:44.100
"of this oscillator-- and
this you can very easily do.",00:01:44.100,00:01:50.600
"It starts with the
first term and then",00:01:50.600,00:01:53.660
"it's a algebraic series, which
will give you that formula.",00:01:53.660,00:02:01.930
"Now, if you are sitting
at some temperature t,",00:02:01.930,00:02:06.720
"you say that the
average energy that you",00:02:06.720,00:02:10.990
"have in your system, well,
the formula that you have is",00:02:10.990,00:02:16.090
"minus the log z by the beta,
which if I apply to the z",00:02:16.090,00:02:22.170
"that I have about, essentially
weighs each one of these",00:02:22.170,00:02:27.010
"by these Boltzmann weights
by the corresponding energy",00:02:27.010,00:02:30.170
and sums them.,00:02:30.170,00:02:31.910
"What we do is we get,
essentially, the contribution",00:02:31.910,00:02:36.740
of the ground state.,00:02:36.740,00:02:38.660
"Actually, for all intents and
purposes, we can ignore this,",00:02:38.660,00:02:44.390
"and, hence, this.",00:02:44.390,00:02:45.870
"But for completion,
let's have them around.",00:02:45.870,00:02:50.090
"And then from what is
in the denominator,",00:02:50.090,00:02:52.960
"if you take derivative
with respect to beta,",00:02:52.960,00:02:56.520
"you will get a factor
of h bar omega.",00:02:56.520,00:02:59.330
"And then this factor of 1 minus
e to the minus beta h bar.",00:02:59.330,00:03:04.010
"Actually, we then additional
e to the minus beta",00:03:06.950,00:03:10.190
h bar omega in here.,00:03:10.190,00:03:11.642
"Now, the thing that
we really compare to",00:03:17.430,00:03:20.860
"was what happens if we were to
take one more derivative to see",00:03:20.860,00:03:25.540
"how much the heat
capacity is that we",00:03:25.540,00:03:28.870
have in the harmonic oscillator.,00:03:28.870,00:03:31.760
"So basically taking an average
of the raw formula with respect",00:03:31.760,00:03:36.070
"to temperature, realizing
that these betas are",00:03:36.070,00:03:39.680
inverse temperatures.,00:03:39.680,00:03:42.970
"So derivatives with
respect to t will",00:03:42.970,00:03:46.896
"be related to
derivative with respect",00:03:46.896,00:03:48.437
"to beta, except that I've will
get an additional factor of 1",00:03:48.437,00:03:52.370
over k bt squared.,00:03:52.370,00:03:54.770
"So the whole thing I
could write that as kb",00:03:54.770,00:03:58.190
"and then I had the h bar
omega over kt squared.",00:03:58.190,00:04:07.500
"And then from these factors,
I had something like e",00:04:07.500,00:04:11.570
"to the minus e to the
h bar omega over kt.",00:04:11.570,00:04:20.275
"E to the h bar omega
over kt minus 1 squared.",00:04:20.275,00:04:25.860
"So if we were to plug
this function, the heat",00:04:29.510,00:04:36.830
"capacity in its natural
unit that are this kb, then",00:04:36.830,00:04:44.570
"as a function of
temperature, we get behavior",00:04:44.570,00:04:51.390
"that we can actually
express correctly",00:04:51.390,00:04:54.740
in terms of the combination.,00:04:54.740,00:04:56.160
"You can see always
we get temperature",00:04:56.160,00:04:58.870
in units of kb over h bar omega.,00:04:58.870,00:05:02.110
"So I can really plug
this in the form of, say,",00:05:02.110,00:05:06.260
"kt over h bar omega,
which we call t",00:05:06.260,00:05:10.897
"to some characteristic
temperature.",00:05:10.897,00:05:12.355
"And the behavior that we have
is that close to 0 temperatures,",00:05:14.870,00:05:22.090
"you go to 0
exponentially, because",00:05:22.090,00:05:24.450
"of essentially the ratio
of these exponentials.",00:05:24.450,00:05:27.690
"We leave one exponential
in the denominator.",00:05:27.690,00:05:31.010
"So the gaps that you have
between n equals to 0",00:05:31.010,00:05:34.668
"and n equals to 1
translates to behavior",00:05:34.668,00:05:39.410
"of that at low temperatures
is exponentially",00:05:39.410,00:05:42.730
decaying to leading order.,00:05:42.730,00:05:45.230
"Then, eventually, at
high temperatures,",00:05:51.170,00:05:55.040
"you get the classical result
where you saturate to 1.",00:05:55.040,00:06:01.260
"And so you will
have a curve that",00:06:01.260,00:06:05.380
"has a shift from one
behavior to another behavior.",00:06:05.380,00:06:10.350
"And the place where
this transition occurs",00:06:10.350,00:06:15.320
"is when this combination
is of the order of 1.",00:06:15.320,00:06:19.220
"I'm not saying it's precisely
1, but it's of the order of 1.",00:06:19.220,00:06:23.030
"So, basically, you have
this kind of behavior.",00:06:23.030,00:06:25.324
OK?,00:06:28.782,00:06:31.260
"So we use this curve
to explain the heat",00:06:31.260,00:06:34.740
"capacity of diatomic gas,
such as the gas in this room,",00:06:34.740,00:06:39.160
"and why at room temperature, we
see a heat capacity in which it",00:06:39.160,00:06:44.800
"appears that the vibrational
degrees of freedom are frozen,",00:06:44.800,00:06:48.380
are not contributing anything.,00:06:48.380,00:06:50.640
"While at temperatures above
the characteristic vibrational",00:06:50.640,00:06:54.500
"frequency, which for a
gas is of the order of 10",00:06:54.500,00:06:57.392
"to the 3 degrees
k, you really get",00:06:57.392,00:07:00.940
"energy in the
harmonic oscillator",00:07:00.940,00:07:02.680
also in the vibrations.,00:07:02.680,00:07:04.120
"And the heat capacity
jumps, because you",00:07:04.120,00:07:06.530
"have another way
of storing energy.",00:07:06.530,00:07:08.240
"So the next thing that we asked
was whether this describes also",00:07:11.010,00:07:27.510
heat capacity of a solid.,00:07:27.510,00:07:31.990
"So basically, for
the diatomic gas,",00:07:36.790,00:07:38.860
"you have two atoms that
are bonded together",00:07:38.860,00:07:42.870
into a molecule.,00:07:42.870,00:07:44.360
"And you consider the
vibrations of that.",00:07:44.360,00:07:47.520
"You can regard the
solid as a huge molecule",00:07:47.520,00:07:51.830
"with lots of atoms
joined together.",00:07:51.830,00:07:54.560
And they have vibrations.,00:07:54.560,00:07:56.720
"And if you think about all of
those vibrations giving you",00:07:56.720,00:08:00.830
"something that is
similar to this,",00:08:00.830,00:08:03.550
"you would conclude that the
heat capacity of a solid",00:08:03.550,00:08:06.240
"should also have this
kind of behavior.",00:08:06.240,00:08:09.690
"Whereas we noted
that in actuality,",00:08:09.690,00:08:12.440
"the heat capacity of a solid
vanishes much more slowly",00:08:12.440,00:08:20.820
at low temperatures.,00:08:20.820,00:08:23.230
"And the dependence
at low temperatures",00:08:23.230,00:08:26.740
is proportional to t cubed.,00:08:26.740,00:08:28.560
"So at the end of
last lecture, we",00:08:33.150,00:08:36.590
"gave an explanation for
this, which I will repeat.",00:08:36.590,00:08:42.820
"Again, the picture is that the
solid, like a huge molecule,",00:08:42.820,00:08:48.000
has vibrational modes.,00:08:48.000,00:08:50.910
"But these vibrational
modes cover a whole range",00:08:50.910,00:08:53.560
of different frequencies.,00:08:53.560,00:08:56.150
"And so if you ask, what
are the frequencies omega",00:08:56.150,00:09:04.630
"alpha of vibrations of a
solid, the most natural way",00:09:04.630,00:09:20.510
"to characterize
them is, in fact,",00:09:20.510,00:09:23.640
"in terms of a wave vector k
that indicates a direction",00:09:23.640,00:09:29.970
"for the oscillatory wave that
you set up in the material.",00:09:29.970,00:09:35.270
"And depending on k, you'll
have different frequencies.",00:09:35.270,00:09:47.420
"And I said that, essentially,
the longest wave length",00:09:47.420,00:09:54.150
"corresponding to k equals to
0 is taking the whole solid",00:09:54.150,00:09:58.180
and translating it.,00:09:58.180,00:09:59.340
"Again, thinking back about the
oxygen molecule, the oxygen",00:09:59.340,00:10:03.570
"molecule, you have
two coordinates.",00:10:03.570,00:10:06.000
"It's the relative coordinate
that has the vibration.",00:10:06.000,00:10:09.560
"And you have a center of mass
coordinate that has no energy.",00:10:09.560,00:10:13.500
"If you make a molecule
more and more complicated,",00:10:13.500,00:10:16.030
"you will have more modes,
but you will always",00:10:16.030,00:10:18.480
"have the 0 mode that
corresponds to the translation.",00:10:18.480,00:10:22.480
"And that carries over
all the way to the solid.",00:10:22.480,00:10:25.010
"So there is a mode that
corresponds to translations--",00:10:25.010,00:10:28.500
"and, in fact, rotations--
that would carry",00:10:28.500,00:10:31.420
"no energy, and corresponds,
therefore, to 0 frequency.",00:10:31.420,00:10:37.940
"And then if you start to make
long wavelength oscillations,",00:10:37.940,00:10:42.690
"the frequency is
going to be small.",00:10:42.690,00:10:45.980
"And, indeed, what we know
is that we tap on the solid",00:10:45.980,00:10:49.460
"and you create
sound waves, which",00:10:49.460,00:10:51.830
"means that the low-frequency
long wavelength",00:10:51.830,00:10:56.360
"modes have a dispersion
relation in which omega",00:10:56.360,00:11:00.050
is proportional to k.,00:11:00.050,00:11:02.090
"We can write that as
omega is v times k, where",00:11:02.090,00:11:06.340
"v is the velocity of
the sound in the solid.",00:11:06.340,00:11:10.600
"Now, of course, the shortest
wave length that you can have",00:11:10.600,00:11:16.230
"is related to the separation
between the atoms in the solid.",00:11:16.230,00:11:20.540
"And so, basically,
there's a limit",00:11:20.540,00:11:23.190
"to the range of k's that
you can put in your system.",00:11:23.190,00:11:27.300
"And this linear
behavior is going",00:11:27.300,00:11:29.570
"to get modified once you get
towards the age of the solid.",00:11:29.570,00:11:34.170
"And the reason I
have alpha here is",00:11:34.170,00:11:39.100
"because you can have
different polarizations.",00:11:39.100,00:11:42.390
"There are three different
possible polarizations.",00:11:42.390,00:11:45.480
"So in principle,
you will have three",00:11:45.480,00:11:47.820
"of these curves in
the system hard.",00:11:47.820,00:11:51.080
"And these curves could
be very complicated",00:11:55.210,00:11:59.720
"when you get to the
edge of [INAUDIBLE] zone",00:11:59.720,00:12:01.980
"and you have to solve
a big dynamical matrix",00:12:01.980,00:12:05.790
"in order to extract what
the frequencies are,",00:12:05.790,00:12:09.060
"if you want to have
the complete spectrum.",00:12:09.060,00:12:13.370
"So the solid is a collection of
these harmonic oscillators that",00:12:13.370,00:12:17.770
"are, in principle,
very complicated.",00:12:17.770,00:12:20.180
But we have the following.,00:12:22.730,00:12:26.070
"So I say, OK, I
have all of these.",00:12:26.070,00:12:28.545
"And I want to calculate
at a given temperature",00:12:28.545,00:12:31.400
"how much energy I
have put in the solid.",00:12:31.400,00:12:34.480
"So this energy that I
have put in the vibrations",00:12:34.480,00:12:38.690
"at some temperature t, assuming
that these vibrations are",00:12:38.690,00:12:43.180
"really a collection
of these oscillators.",00:12:43.180,00:12:47.610
"Well, what I have to do is
to add up all of these terms.",00:12:47.610,00:12:52.930
"There's going to be adding up
all of the h bar omega over 2s",00:12:52.930,00:12:56.820
for all of these.,00:12:56.820,00:12:58.920
OK?,00:12:58.920,00:12:59.420
"That will give me something
that I will simply call e 0,",00:12:59.420,00:13:02.500
"because it doesn't
depend on temperature.",00:13:02.500,00:13:04.330
"Presumably will exist
at 0 temperature.",00:13:04.330,00:13:06.950
"And I can even fold
into that whatever",00:13:06.950,00:13:09.380
"the value of the potential
energy of the interactions",00:13:09.380,00:13:13.300
"between the particles
is at 0 temperature.",00:13:13.300,00:13:16.670
"What I'm interested in really
is the temperature dependence.",00:13:16.670,00:13:20.690
"So I basically take the
formula that I have over there,",00:13:20.690,00:13:24.500
"and sum over all of
these oscillators.",00:13:24.500,00:13:28.060
"These oscillators are
characterized by polarization",00:13:28.060,00:13:31.220
and by the wave vector k.,00:13:31.220,00:13:33.780
"And then I have, essentially,
h bar omega alpha",00:13:33.780,00:13:39.560
"of k divided by e to the beta
h bar omega alpha of k minus 1.",00:13:39.560,00:13:48.750
"So I have to apply that formula
to this potentially very",00:13:48.750,00:13:53.440
complicated set of frequencies.,00:13:53.440,00:13:57.320
"The thing is, that according
to the picture that I have over",00:13:57.320,00:14:01.720
"here, to a 0 order
approximation,",00:14:01.720,00:14:06.920
"you would say that
the heat capacity is 1",00:14:06.920,00:14:10.540
"if you are on this side,
0 if you're on that side.",00:14:10.540,00:14:15.190
"What distinguishes
those two sides",00:14:15.190,00:14:18.790
"is whether the frequency in
combination with temperature",00:14:18.790,00:14:22.860
is less than or larger than 1.,00:14:22.860,00:14:25.670
"Basically, low frequencies
would end up being here.",00:14:25.670,00:14:31.150
"High frequencies would
end up being here.",00:14:31.150,00:14:33.610
And would not contribute.,00:14:33.610,00:14:36.040
"So for a given temperature,
there is some borderline.",00:14:36.040,00:14:41.150
"That borderline would
correspond to kt over h bar.",00:14:41.150,00:14:45.310
"So let me draw where
that borderline is.",00:14:45.310,00:14:49.630
Kt over h bar.,00:14:49.630,00:14:52.600
"For a particular temperature,
all of these modes",00:14:52.600,00:14:55.770
are not really contributing.,00:14:55.770,00:14:57.930
"All of these modes
are contributing.",00:14:57.930,00:15:00.550
"If my temperature
is high enough,",00:15:00.550,00:15:03.660
everything is contributing.,00:15:03.660,00:15:05.880
"And the total number
of oscillators is 3 n.",00:15:05.880,00:15:09.600
It's the number of atoms.,00:15:09.600,00:15:10.810
"So essentially, I
will get 3 n times",00:15:10.810,00:15:13.490
"whatever formula
I have over there.",00:15:13.490,00:15:15.790
"As a come further
and further down,",00:15:15.790,00:15:18.010
"there's some kind of
complicated behavior",00:15:18.010,00:15:20.400
"as I go through this
spaghetti of modes.",00:15:20.400,00:15:23.600
"But when I get to low
enough structures,",00:15:23.600,00:15:27.140
"then, again, things
become simple,",00:15:27.140,00:15:29.110
"because I will only be
sensitive to the modes that",00:15:29.110,00:15:33.020
"are described by this
a omega being vk.",00:15:33.020,00:15:37.260
OK?,00:15:37.260,00:15:38.040
"So if I'm interested
in t going to 0,",00:15:38.040,00:15:44.980
"means less than some
characteristic temperature",00:15:44.980,00:15:48.055
that we have to define shortly.,00:15:48.055,00:15:50.890
"So let's say, replace this
with t less than some theta",00:15:50.890,00:15:56.270
"d that I have to
get for you shortly,",00:15:56.270,00:16:00.140
"then I will replace this
with e 0 plus sum over alpha",00:16:00.140,00:16:06.930
"and k of h bar v alpha
k e to the beta h bar e",00:16:06.930,00:16:16.520
alpha k minus 1.,00:16:16.520,00:16:21.890
OK?,00:16:21.890,00:16:22.390
"Now, for simplicity,
essentially I",00:16:26.320,00:16:32.080
have to do three different sums.,00:16:32.080,00:16:33.700
"All of them are the
same up to having",00:16:33.700,00:16:36.300
"to use different values of
v. Let's just for simplicity",00:16:36.300,00:16:40.700
"assume that all of the
v alphas are the same v,",00:16:40.700,00:16:45.850
"so that I really have
only one velocity.",00:16:45.850,00:16:48.570
"There's really no difficulty
in generalizing this.",00:16:48.570,00:16:51.200
"So let's do this for
simplicity of algebra.",00:16:51.200,00:16:55.140
"So if I do that, then
the sum over alpha",00:16:55.140,00:16:58.360
"will simply give
me a factor of 3.",00:16:58.360,00:17:00.420
"There are three possible
polarizations, so I put a 3",00:17:00.420,00:17:03.390
there.,00:17:03.390,00:17:05.720
"And then I have to do
the summation over k.",00:17:05.720,00:17:08.500
"Well, what does the
summation over k mean?",00:17:08.500,00:17:11.640
"When I have a small molecule
for the, let's say, three",00:17:11.640,00:17:16.440
"or four atoms, then
I can enumerate",00:17:16.440,00:17:19.119
"what the different
vibrational states are.",00:17:19.119,00:17:21.980
"As I go to a large
solid, I essentially",00:17:21.980,00:17:27.520
"have modes that are
at each value of k,",00:17:27.520,00:17:32.930
"but, in reality,
they are discrete.",00:17:32.930,00:17:35.040
"They are very, very, very,
very finely separated",00:17:35.040,00:17:38.400
"by a separation that
is of the order of 2",00:17:38.400,00:17:41.390
pi over the size of the system.,00:17:41.390,00:17:45.110
"So to ensure that eventually
when you count all of the modes",00:17:45.110,00:17:49.580
"that you have here,
you, again, end up",00:17:49.580,00:17:51.550
"to have of the
order of n states.",00:17:51.550,00:17:56.010
"So if that's the case,
this sum, really I",00:17:56.010,00:18:00.330
"can replace with an integral,
because going from one point",00:18:00.330,00:18:04.930
"to the next point does
not make much difference.",00:18:04.930,00:18:07.320
"So I will have an
integral over k.",00:18:07.320,00:18:12.070
"But I have to know how
densely these things are.",00:18:12.070,00:18:15.850
"And in one direction
it is 2 pi over l.",00:18:15.850,00:18:19.120
"So the density would
be l over 2 pi.",00:18:19.120,00:18:21.840
"If I look at all
three directions,",00:18:21.840,00:18:23.850
I have to multiply all of them.,00:18:23.850,00:18:26.180
"So I will get v
divided by 2 pi cubed.",00:18:26.180,00:18:28.990
"So this is the usual
density of states.",00:18:28.990,00:18:32.670
"And you go to description
in terms of wave numbers,",00:18:32.670,00:18:39.250
"or, later on, in
terms of momentums.",00:18:39.250,00:18:42.280
"And what we have here is
this integral h bar v k e",00:18:42.280,00:18:49.071
to the beta h bar v k minus 1.,00:18:49.071,00:18:53.352
OK?,00:18:56.520,00:18:58.960
"So let's simplify this
a little bit further.",00:18:58.960,00:19:03.100
I have e 0.,00:19:03.100,00:19:04.880
I have 3v.,00:19:04.880,00:19:05.730
"The integrand only depends
on the magnitude of k,",00:19:05.730,00:19:12.650
"so I can take advantage
of that spherical symmetry",00:19:12.650,00:19:15.610
"and write this as 4 pi k squared
v k divided by this 8 pi cubed.",00:19:15.610,00:19:22.140
"What I can do is I
can also introduce",00:19:25.660,00:19:31.200
"a factor of beta here,
multiplied by k t.",00:19:31.200,00:19:36.270
Beta k t is 1.,00:19:36.270,00:19:39.530
"And if I call this
combination to be x, then what",00:19:39.530,00:19:45.890
"I have is k b t x
e to the x minus 1.",00:19:45.890,00:19:54.560
"Of course, k is simply
related to x by k",00:19:58.280,00:20:02.995
being x kt over h bar v.,00:20:02.995,00:20:17.970
"And so at the next
level of approximation,",00:20:17.970,00:20:20.700
"this k squared v k I will write
in terms of x squared v x.",00:20:20.700,00:20:25.210
And so what do I have?,00:20:25.210,00:20:26.550
I have e 0.,00:20:26.550,00:20:29.080
"I have 3v divided
by 2 pi squared.",00:20:29.080,00:20:33.965
"Because of this factor of
kt that I will take outside",00:20:38.600,00:20:42.040
I have a kt.,00:20:42.040,00:20:44.890
"I have a k squared
vk that I want",00:20:44.890,00:20:47.270
to replace with x squared v x.,00:20:47.270,00:20:49.350
"And that will give me
an additional factor",00:20:49.350,00:20:51.640
of kv over h bar v cubed.,00:20:51.640,00:20:56.970
"And then I have an
integral 0 to e 0 v",00:20:56.970,00:21:01.020
x x cubed e to the x minus 1.,00:21:01.020,00:21:06.930
"Now, in principle, when I
start with this integration,",00:21:13.035,00:21:17.470
"I have a finite range
for k, which presumably",00:21:17.470,00:21:23.670
"would translate into
a finite range for x.",00:21:23.670,00:21:27.680
"But in reality none of
these modes is contributing,",00:21:27.680,00:21:31.880
"so I could extend the
range of integration",00:21:31.880,00:21:34.430
"all the way to infinity,
and make very small error",00:21:34.430,00:21:38.300
at low temperatures.,00:21:38.300,00:21:40.460
"And the advantage of
that is that then this",00:21:40.460,00:21:43.100
becomes a definite integral.,00:21:43.100,00:21:47.160
"Something that you
can look up in tables.",00:21:47.160,00:21:50.110
"And its value is in fact
pi to the fourth over 15.",00:21:50.110,00:21:54.083
"So substituting that over
there, what do we have?",00:21:57.870,00:22:02.090
"We have that the energy is
e 0 plus 3 divided by 15,",00:22:02.090,00:22:12.900
"will give me 5, which
turns the 2 into a 10.",00:22:12.900,00:22:17.530
"I have pi to the fourth
divided by pi squared,",00:22:20.480,00:22:23.990
"so there's a pi squared
that will survive out here.",00:22:23.990,00:22:28.450
I have a kt.,00:22:28.450,00:22:31.515
I have kt over h bar v cubed.,00:22:31.515,00:22:39.990
"And then I have a
factor of volume.",00:22:39.990,00:22:41.980
"But volume is proportional
to the number of particles",00:22:41.980,00:22:46.280
"that I have in the system
times the size of my unit cell.",00:22:46.280,00:22:50.180
Let's call that a cubed.,00:22:50.180,00:22:52.760
"So this I can write
this as l a cubed.",00:22:52.760,00:22:57.230
"Why do I do that is because
when I then take the derivative,",00:22:57.230,00:23:00.900
"I'd like to write the heat
capacity per particle.",00:23:00.900,00:23:05.250
"So, indeed, if I now take the
derivative, which is de by dt,",00:23:05.250,00:23:12.726
"the answer will be
proportional to n and kv.",00:23:12.726,00:23:18.210
"The number of particles
and this k v, which",00:23:18.210,00:23:22.000
"is the function, the
unit of heat capacities.",00:23:22.000,00:23:28.460
"The overall dependence
is t to the fourth.",00:23:28.460,00:23:32.180
"So when I take derivatives,
I will get 4t cubed.",00:23:32.180,00:23:35.800
"That 4 will change the 1 over
10 to 2 pi squared over 5.",00:23:35.800,00:23:43.830
"And then I have the
combination kvt h bar",00:23:43.830,00:23:49.360
"v, and that factor of a
raised to the third power.",00:23:49.360,00:23:54.540
"So the whole thing is
proportional to t cubed.",00:23:54.540,00:23:57.950
"And the coefficient I will
call theta d for [INAUDIBLE].",00:23:57.950,00:24:04.090
"And theta d I have calculated
to be h bar v over a h",00:24:04.090,00:24:11.695
bar v a over k t.,00:24:11.695,00:24:14.790
"No, h bar v over a k t.",00:24:14.790,00:24:17.276
"So the heat capacity
of the solid",00:24:30.940,00:24:35.520
"is going to be proportional,
of course, to n k b.",00:24:35.520,00:24:38.960
"But most importantly, is
proportional to t cubed.",00:24:38.960,00:24:42.620
"And t cubed just came
from this argument",00:24:42.620,00:24:46.480
that I need low omegas.,00:24:46.480,00:24:48.860
"And how many things
I have at the omega.",00:24:48.860,00:24:51.310
"How many frequencies do I
have that are vibrating?",00:24:51.310,00:24:55.180
"The number of those
frequencies is essentially",00:24:55.180,00:24:57.550
the size of a cube in k space.,00:24:57.550,00:25:01.760
"So it goes like this-- maximum
k cubed in three dimensions.",00:25:01.760,00:25:07.040
"In two dimensions, it will
be squared and all of that.",00:25:07.040,00:25:09.970
"So it's very easy to figure out
from this dispersion relation",00:25:09.970,00:25:14.110
"what the low temperature
behavior of the heat capacity",00:25:14.110,00:25:17.180
has to be.,00:25:17.180,00:25:18.350
"And you will see that this
is, in fact, predictive,",00:25:18.350,00:25:21.990
"in that later on
in the course, we",00:25:21.990,00:25:24.930
"will come an example of where
the heat capacity of a liquid,",00:25:24.930,00:25:29.300
"which was helium, was observed
to have this t cubed behavior",00:25:29.300,00:25:34.610
"based on that Landau immediately
postulated that there should be",00:25:34.610,00:25:38.635
"a phonon-like dispersion
inside that superfluid.",00:25:38.635,00:25:42.290
OK.,00:25:44.970,00:25:45.470
"So that's the story of the
heat capacity of the solid.",00:25:48.000,00:25:52.980
So we started with a molecule.,00:25:52.980,00:25:55.770
"We went from a molecule
into an entire solid.",00:25:55.770,00:26:00.470
"The next step that what
I'm going to do is I'm",00:26:00.470,00:26:04.480
"going to remove the solid
and just keep the box.",00:26:04.480,00:26:08.140
"So essentially, they
calculation that I",00:26:14.640,00:26:16.720
"did, if you think
about it, corresponded",00:26:16.720,00:26:19.530
"to having some kind
of a box, and having",00:26:19.530,00:26:24.000
"vibrational modes
inside the box.",00:26:24.000,00:26:27.820
"But let's imagine that
it is an empty box.",00:26:27.820,00:26:31.670
"But we know that even in
empty space we have light.",00:26:31.670,00:26:36.170
"So within an empty
box, we can still",00:26:36.170,00:26:39.960
"have modes of the
electromagnetic field.",00:26:39.960,00:26:43.420
"Modes of electromagnetic
field, just like the modes",00:26:47.430,00:26:51.590
"of the solid, we
can characterize",00:26:51.590,00:26:54.930
"by the direction along
which oscillations travel.",00:26:54.930,00:26:58.790
"And whereas for the atoms in the
solid, they have displacement",00:27:01.490,00:27:08.220
"and the corresponding momentum
for the electromagnetic field,",00:27:08.220,00:27:13.170
you have the electric field.,00:27:13.170,00:27:15.580
"And its conjugate is
the magnetic field.",00:27:15.580,00:27:19.130
"And these things
will be oscillating",00:27:19.130,00:27:21.720
to create for you a wave.,00:27:21.720,00:27:23.310
"Except that, whereas for
the solid, for each atom",00:27:27.030,00:27:31.390
"we had three
possible directions,",00:27:31.390,00:27:33.410
"and therefore we had three
branches, for this, since e",00:27:33.410,00:27:37.965
"and b have to be
orthogonal to k,",00:27:37.965,00:27:40.690
"you really have only
two polarizations.",00:27:40.690,00:27:42.710
"But apart from that,
the frequency spectrum",00:27:51.440,00:27:55.520
"is exactly the same
as we would have",00:27:55.520,00:27:58.270
"for the solids at low
temperature replacing",00:27:58.270,00:28:01.290
"to v that we have with
the speed of light.",00:28:01.290,00:28:07.090
"And so you would say, OK.",00:28:07.090,00:28:12.060
"If I were to calculate
the energy content that",00:28:12.060,00:28:16.570
"is inside the box,
what I have to do",00:28:16.570,00:28:21.740
"is to sum over all of the
modes and polarizations.",00:28:21.740,00:28:28.160
"Regarding each one of these
as a harmonic oscillator,",00:28:31.150,00:28:35.550
"going through the system
of quantizing according",00:28:35.550,00:28:38.430
"to this old quantum mechanics,
the harmonic oscillators,",00:28:38.430,00:28:41.860
"I have to add up the energy
content of each oscillator.",00:28:41.860,00:28:44.660
"And so what I have is
this h bar omega of k.",00:28:44.660,00:28:53.920
"And then I have
1/2 plus 1 over e",00:28:53.920,00:28:58.470
"to the beta h bar
omega of k minus 1.",00:28:58.470,00:29:02.910
"And then I can do exactly
the kinds of things",00:29:06.280,00:29:08.890
"that I had before,
replacing the sum over k",00:29:08.890,00:29:12.880
with a v times an integral.,00:29:12.880,00:29:16.280
"So the whole thing
would be, first of all,",00:29:16.280,00:29:19.370
"proportional to v, going
from the sum over k",00:29:19.370,00:29:22.960
to the integration over k.,00:29:22.960,00:29:24.610
"I would have to add all of
these h bar omega over 2s.",00:29:27.410,00:29:33.570
"Has no temperature dependence,
so let me just, again, call it",00:29:33.570,00:29:37.290
some e 0.,00:29:37.290,00:29:39.150
"Actually, let's
call it epsilon 0,",00:29:39.150,00:29:40.800
"because it's more like
an energy density.",00:29:40.800,00:29:44.820
"And then I have the sum
over all of the other modes.",00:29:44.820,00:29:48.850
There's two polarisations.,00:29:48.850,00:29:50.200
"So as opposed to the three
that I had before, I have two.",00:29:50.200,00:29:54.260
"I have, again, the
integral over k of 4 pi k",00:29:54.260,00:30:00.150
"squared v k divided
by 8 pi cubed, which",00:30:00.150,00:30:04.600
"is part of this density
of state calculation.",00:30:04.600,00:30:08.370
"I have, again, a
factor of h bar omega.",00:30:08.370,00:30:17.030
"Now, I realize that
my omega is ck.",00:30:17.030,00:30:21.500
"So I simply write
it as h bar ck.",00:30:21.500,00:30:25.130
"And then I have e to the
beta h bar ck minus 1.",00:30:25.130,00:30:30.850
"So we will again allow this
to go from 0 to infinity.",00:30:37.490,00:30:44.710
And what do we get?,00:30:44.710,00:30:47.010
"We will get v epsilon 0 plus,
well, the 8 and 8 cancel.",00:30:47.010,00:30:55.890
I have pi over pi squared.,00:30:55.890,00:30:59.570
So pi over pi cubed.,00:30:59.570,00:31:01.640
"So it will give me
1 over pi squared.",00:31:01.640,00:31:03.445
I have one factor of kt.,00:31:07.170,00:31:10.175
"Again, when I
introduce here a beta",00:31:13.310,00:31:16.460
"and then multiply by kt,
so that this dimension,",00:31:16.460,00:31:20.279
this combination appears.,00:31:20.279,00:31:21.320
"Then I have, if I were to
change variable and call",00:31:25.330,00:31:29.305
"this the new variable,
I have factor",00:31:29.305,00:31:33.730
"of k squared dk, which
gives me, just as",00:31:33.730,00:31:39.010
"before over there, a factor
of kt over h bar c cubed.",00:31:39.010,00:31:43.870
"And then I have
this integral left,",00:31:49.150,00:31:53.710
"which is the 0 to infinity v
x x cubed e to the x minus 1,",00:31:53.710,00:32:01.780
"which we stated is pi
to the fourth over 15.",00:32:01.780,00:32:06.194
"So the part that is dependent
on temperature, the energy",00:32:11.810,00:32:19.130
"content, just as in this case,
scales as t to the fourth.",00:32:19.130,00:32:24.450
"There is one part
that we have over here",00:32:27.590,00:32:31.540
"from all of the 0s, which
is, in fact, an infinity.",00:32:31.540,00:32:35.975
"And maybe there is some
degree of worry about that.",00:32:39.540,00:32:44.260
"We didn't have to worry about
that infinity in this case,",00:32:44.260,00:32:49.940
"because the number of modes that
we had was, in reality, finite.",00:32:49.940,00:32:55.420
"So once we were to add up
properly all of these 0 point",00:32:55.420,00:33:01.190
"energies for this, we would
have gotten a finite number.",00:33:01.190,00:33:04.050
"It would have been large, but
it would have been finite.",00:33:04.050,00:33:07.540
"Whereas here, the difference
is that there is really",00:33:07.540,00:33:11.990
no upper cut-off.,00:33:11.990,00:33:14.170
"So this k here, for a solid,
you have a minimum wavelength.",00:33:14.170,00:33:21.780
"You can't do things shorter than
the separation of particles.",00:33:21.780,00:33:25.710
"But for light, you can have
arbitrarily short wavelength,",00:33:25.710,00:33:30.860
"and that gives you this
infinity over here.",00:33:30.860,00:33:34.690
"So typically, we ignore that.",00:33:34.690,00:33:37.310
"Maybe it is related to the
cosmological constant, et",00:33:37.310,00:33:40.640
cetera.,00:33:40.640,00:33:41.540
"But for our purposes, we are not
going to focus on that at all.",00:33:41.540,00:33:46.090
"And the interesting
part is this part,",00:33:46.090,00:33:48.150
"that proportional
to t to the fourth.",00:33:48.150,00:33:52.110
"There are two SOP
calculations to this",00:33:52.110,00:33:55.090
"that I will just give
part of the answer,",00:33:55.090,00:33:58.280
"because another
part of the answer",00:33:58.280,00:34:00.110
"is something that you
do in problem sets.",00:34:00.110,00:34:05.730
"One of them is that what we
have here is an energy density.",00:34:05.730,00:34:09.989
It's proportional to volume.,00:34:09.989,00:34:12.260
"And we have seen
that energy densities",00:34:12.260,00:34:14.989
are related to pressures.,00:34:14.989,00:34:17.770
"So indeed, there is a
corresponding pressure.",00:34:17.770,00:34:20.134
"That is, if you're
at the temperature t,",00:34:23.030,00:34:26.139
"this collection of vibrating
electromagnetic fields",00:34:26.139,00:34:33.190
"exerts a pressure on the
walls of the container.",00:34:33.190,00:34:37.429
"This pressure is related
to energy density.",00:34:37.429,00:34:44.120
"The factor of 1/3 comes because
of the dispersion relation.",00:34:44.120,00:34:49.870
"And you can show that in
one of the problem sets.",00:34:49.870,00:34:52.620
You know that already.,00:34:52.620,00:34:54.719
"So that would say
that you would have,",00:34:54.719,00:34:56.400
"essentially, something
like some kind of p 0.",00:34:56.400,00:35:00.200
"And then something that
is proportional to t",00:35:02.930,00:35:07.860
to the fourth.,00:35:07.860,00:35:09.190
"So I guess the correspondent
coefficient here",00:35:09.190,00:35:12.760
"would be p squared divided by
45 kt kt over h bar c cubed.",00:35:12.760,00:35:28.200
"So there is radiation
pressure that",00:35:28.200,00:35:31.620
is proportional to temperature.,00:35:31.620,00:35:33.790
"The hotter you make this box,
the more pressure it will get",00:35:33.790,00:35:38.160
exerted from it.,00:35:38.160,00:35:40.560
"There is, of course,
again this infinity",00:35:40.560,00:35:42.730
that you may worry about.,00:35:42.730,00:35:45.140
"But here the problem
is less serious,",00:35:45.140,00:35:48.640
"because you would
say that in reality,",00:35:48.640,00:35:51.280
"if I have the wall
of the box, it",00:35:51.280,00:35:53.980
"is going to get pressure
from both sides.",00:35:53.980,00:35:57.740
"And if there's an infinite
pressure from both sides,",00:35:57.740,00:36:00.437
they will cancel.,00:36:00.437,00:36:01.145
"So you don't have
to worry about that.",00:36:01.145,00:36:04.390
"But it turns out
that, actually, you",00:36:04.390,00:36:06.450
"can measure the consequences
of this pressure.",00:36:06.450,00:36:10.470
"And that occurs when rather
than having one plate,",00:36:10.470,00:36:16.450
"you have two plates
that there are",00:36:16.450,00:36:19.380
some small separation apart.,00:36:19.380,00:36:22.940
"Then the modes of
radiation that you",00:36:22.940,00:36:25.040
"can fit in here because of the
quantizations that you have,",00:36:25.040,00:36:29.830
"are different from the modes
that you can have out here.",00:36:29.830,00:36:34.470
"So that difference, even from
the 0 point fluctuations--",00:36:34.470,00:36:39.160
"the h bar omega over
2s-- will give you",00:36:39.160,00:36:42.840
"a pressure that pushes
these plates together.",00:36:42.840,00:36:46.700
"That's called a Casimir
force, or Casimir pressure.",00:36:46.700,00:36:50.280
"And that was predicted
by Casimir in 1950s,",00:36:50.280,00:36:54.520
"and was measured experimentally
roughly 10 years ago",00:36:54.520,00:36:59.150
"to high precision, matching
the formula that we had.",00:36:59.150,00:37:03.070
"So sometimes, these
infinities have",00:37:03.070,00:37:06.050
"consequences that you
have to worry about.",00:37:06.050,00:37:09.330
"But that's also to
indicate that there's",00:37:09.330,00:37:12.580
kind of modern physics to this.,00:37:12.580,00:37:16.250
"But really it was the
origin of quantum mechanics,",00:37:16.250,00:37:20.590
"because of the other aspect
of the physics, which",00:37:20.590,00:37:24.580
"is imagine that again
you have this box.",00:37:24.580,00:37:29.200
"I draw it now as
an irregular box.",00:37:29.200,00:37:32.760
"And I open a hole of
size a inside the box.",00:37:32.760,00:37:37.740
"And then the radiation that
was inside at temperatures t",00:37:37.740,00:37:41.990
will start to go out.,00:37:41.990,00:37:46.400
So you have a hot box.,00:37:46.400,00:37:48.070
You open a hole in it.,00:37:48.070,00:37:49.350
"And then the radiation
starts to come out.",00:37:49.350,00:37:52.450
"And so what you will have
is a flux of radiation.",00:37:52.450,00:37:58.103
"Flux means that this it energy
that is escaping per unit area",00:38:01.670,00:38:08.390
and per unit time.,00:38:08.390,00:38:11.320
"So there's a flux, which
is per area per time.",00:38:11.320,00:38:18.010
"It turns out that
that flux-- and this",00:38:18.010,00:38:21.610
"is another factor,
this factor of 1/3",00:38:21.610,00:38:25.750
"that I mentioned--
is related the energy",00:38:25.750,00:38:29.030
"density with a
factor of 1 c over 4.",00:38:29.030,00:38:34.500
"Essentially, clearly the
velocity with which energy",00:38:34.500,00:38:39.730
escaping is proportional to c.,00:38:39.730,00:38:43.210
"So you will get more
radiation flux the larger c.",00:38:43.210,00:38:47.760
"The answer has to be
proportional to c.",00:38:47.760,00:38:50.470
"And it is what is
inside that is escaping,",00:38:50.470,00:38:53.250
"so it has to be proportional
to the energy density",00:38:53.250,00:38:56.350
"that you have inside, some
kind of energy per unit volume.",00:38:56.350,00:39:02.270
"And the factor of 1/4 is one
of these geometric factors.",00:39:02.270,00:39:08.000
"Essentially, there's two
factors of cosine of theta.",00:39:08.000,00:39:10.920
"And you have to do an average
of cosine squared theta.",00:39:10.920,00:39:13.960
"And that will give you
the additional 1/4.",00:39:13.960,00:39:18.720
OK?,00:39:18.720,00:39:19.770
"But rather than
looking-- so this",00:39:19.770,00:39:23.620
"would tell you that there is an
energy that is streaming out.",00:39:23.620,00:39:26.700
"That is, the net value
is proportional to t",00:39:26.700,00:39:29.510
to the fourth.,00:39:29.510,00:39:30.820
"But more interestingly,
we can ask",00:39:30.820,00:39:35.040
what is the flux per wavelength?,00:39:35.040,00:39:39.880
"And so for that, I can
just go back to the formula",00:39:39.880,00:39:42.980
"before I integrated
over k, and ask",00:39:42.980,00:39:46.260
"what is the energy density
in each interval of k?",00:39:46.260,00:39:51.440
"And so what I have to do is to
just go and look at the formula",00:39:51.440,00:39:56.350
"that I have prior to doing
the integration over k.",00:39:56.350,00:40:00.190
Multiply it by c over 4.,00:40:00.190,00:40:02.720
What do I have?,00:40:02.720,00:40:04.130
"I have 8 pi divided
by 8 pi cubed.",00:40:04.130,00:40:09.460
"I have a factor of k squared
from the density of states.",00:40:09.460,00:40:14.550
"I have this factor of h bar c
k divided by e to the beta h",00:40:14.550,00:40:23.270
bar c k minus 1.,00:40:23.270,00:40:25.350
"So there's no analogue of
this, because I am not doing",00:40:31.920,00:40:38.190
the integration over k.,00:40:38.190,00:40:41.220
"So we can simplify some
of these factors up front.",00:40:41.220,00:40:45.470
"But really, the story is
how does this quantity",00:40:45.470,00:40:49.000
"look as the function
of wave number, which",00:40:49.000,00:40:53.970
"is the inverse of wave
length, if you like.",00:40:53.970,00:40:57.500
"And what we see is that when
k goes to 0, essentially,",00:40:57.500,00:41:02.480
"this factor into
the beta h bar ck",00:41:02.480,00:41:05.740
"I have to expand
to lowest order.",00:41:05.740,00:41:08.210
"I will get beta h bar c k,
because the 1 disappears.",00:41:08.210,00:41:12.430
"H bar ck is cancelled, so
the answer is going to be",00:41:12.430,00:41:15.160
proportional to inverse beta.,00:41:15.160,00:41:17.070
"It's going to be proportional
to kt and k squared.",00:41:17.070,00:41:20.840
"So, essentially, the low
k behavior part of this",00:41:20.840,00:41:25.830
"is proportional to k squared
c, of course, and kt.",00:41:25.830,00:41:32.650
"However, when I go to
the high k numbers,",00:41:38.780,00:41:43.300
"the exponential will
kill things off.",00:41:43.300,00:41:46.190
"So the large k part
of this is going",00:41:46.190,00:41:49.740
to be exponentially small.,00:41:49.740,00:41:51.370
"And, actually, the curve will
look something like this,",00:41:55.570,00:41:59.580
therefore.,00:41:59.580,00:42:02.400
"It will have a maximum around
the k, which presumably",00:42:02.400,00:42:08.770
"is of the order of
kt over h bar c.",00:42:08.770,00:42:17.100
"So basically, the
hotter you have,",00:42:20.080,00:42:26.410
this will move to the right.,00:42:26.410,00:42:29.990
"The wavelengths
will become shorter.",00:42:29.990,00:42:34.060
"And, essentially, that's the
origin of the fact that can you",00:42:34.060,00:42:39.890
"heat some kind of material, it
will start to emit radiation.",00:42:39.890,00:42:45.200
"And the radiation will be
peaked at some frequency that",00:42:45.200,00:42:48.720
is related to its temperature.,00:42:48.720,00:42:52.210
"Now, if we didn't have
this quantization effect,",00:42:52.210,00:42:56.910
"if h bar went to 0,
then what would happen",00:42:56.910,00:43:01.960
"is that this k squared kt
would continue forever.",00:43:01.960,00:43:07.720
OK?,00:43:07.720,00:43:08.380
"Essentially, you
would have in each one",00:43:08.380,00:43:10.590
"of these modes of
radiation, classically,",00:43:10.590,00:43:13.470
you would put a kt of energy.,00:43:13.470,00:43:15.610
"And since you could have
arbitrarily short wavelengths,",00:43:15.610,00:43:19.520
"you would have infinite
energy at shorter and shorter",00:43:19.520,00:43:23.170
wavelengths.,00:43:23.170,00:43:24.080
"And you would have this
ultraviolet catastrophe.",00:43:24.080,00:43:26.370
"Of course, the
shape of this curve",00:43:31.500,00:43:33.750
"was experimentally known towards
the end of the 19th century.",00:43:33.750,00:43:38.490
"And so that was the basis
of thinking about it,",00:43:38.490,00:43:42.020
"and fitting an
exponential to the end,",00:43:42.020,00:43:43.980
"and eventually deducing
that this quantization",00:43:43.980,00:43:47.980
"of the oscillators would
potentially give you",00:43:47.980,00:43:50.900
the reason for this to happen.,00:43:50.900,00:43:52.375
"Now, the way that I
have described it,",00:43:57.610,00:44:01.060
"I focused on having a cavity
and opening the cavity,",00:44:01.060,00:44:05.430
and having the energy go out.,00:44:05.430,00:44:08.720
"Of course, the
experiments for black body",00:44:08.720,00:44:12.260
are not done on cavities.,00:44:12.260,00:44:13.870
"They're done on some piece
of metal or some other thing",00:44:13.870,00:44:17.430
that you heat up.,00:44:17.430,00:44:18.580
"And then you can look at the
spectrum of the radiation.",00:44:18.580,00:44:21.730
"And so, again, there
is some universality",00:44:21.730,00:44:24.590
"in this, that it is not so
sensitive to the properties",00:44:24.590,00:44:29.070
"of the material,
although there are",00:44:29.070,00:44:31.650
"some emissivity and
other factors that",00:44:31.650,00:44:34.010
multiply the final result.,00:44:34.010,00:44:36.900
"So the final result,
in fact, would",00:44:36.900,00:44:38.820
"say that if I were to
integrate over frequencies,",00:44:38.820,00:44:42.860
"the total radiation flux,
which would be c over 4 times",00:44:42.860,00:44:53.340
"the energy density
total, is going",00:44:53.340,00:44:57.190
"to be proportional
to temperature",00:44:57.190,00:44:59.070
to the fourth power.,00:44:59.070,00:45:01.730
"And this constant in front
is the Stefan-Boltzmann,",00:45:01.730,00:45:16.010
"which has some particular
value that you can look up,",00:45:16.010,00:45:23.570
"units of watts per area
per degrees Kelvin.",00:45:23.570,00:45:28.066
"So this perspective
is rather macroscopic.",00:45:33.870,00:45:40.300
"The radiated energy is
proportional to the surface",00:45:40.300,00:45:44.970
area.,00:45:44.970,00:45:46.720
"If you make things
that are small,",00:45:46.720,00:45:50.130
"and the wavelengths that you're
looking at over here become",00:45:50.130,00:45:53.610
"compatible to the
size of the object,",00:45:53.610,00:45:56.160
these formulas break down.,00:45:56.160,00:45:59.160
"And again, go forward
about 150 years or so,",00:45:59.160,00:46:04.000
"there is ongoing research--
I guess more 200 years--",00:46:04.000,00:46:08.120
"ongoing research on--
no, 100 and something--",00:46:08.120,00:46:11.430
"ongoing research on how these
classical laws of radiation",00:46:11.430,00:46:18.550
"are modified when you're dealing
with objects that are small",00:46:18.550,00:46:22.340
"compared to the wavelengths
that are emitted, etc.",00:46:22.340,00:46:25.011
Any questions?,00:46:35.002,00:46:35.585
"So the next part of the story
is why did you do all of this?",00:46:38.950,00:46:47.810
"It works, but what
is the justification?",00:46:47.810,00:46:51.400
"In that I said there was
the old quantum mechanics.",00:46:54.960,00:47:00.960
"But really, we want to have
statements about quantum",00:47:00.960,00:47:06.840
"systems that are not
harmonic oscillators.",00:47:06.840,00:47:11.050
"And we want to be able
to understand actually",00:47:11.050,00:47:14.890
"what the underlying
basis is in the same way",00:47:14.890,00:47:18.540
"that they understand
how we were doing things",00:47:18.540,00:47:21.190
"for classical
statistical mechanics.",00:47:21.190,00:47:25.420
"And so really, we
want to look at how",00:47:25.420,00:47:28.660
"to make the transition
from classical to quantum",00:47:28.660,00:47:32.564
statistical mechanics.,00:47:32.564,00:47:33.480
"So for that, let's
go and remind us.",00:47:39.850,00:47:44.910
"Actually, so
basically the question",00:47:44.910,00:47:47.010
"is something like
this-- what does",00:47:47.010,00:47:49.920
this partition function mean?,00:47:49.920,00:47:53.810
"I'm calculating
things as if I have",00:47:53.810,00:47:57.110
"these states that are
the energy levels.",00:47:57.110,00:47:59.590
"And the probabilities are e
to the minus beta epsilon n.",00:47:59.590,00:48:05.080
What does that mean?,00:48:05.080,00:48:06.320
"Classically, we knew
the Boltzmann rates",00:48:06.320,00:48:09.640
"had something to do with
the probability of finding",00:48:09.640,00:48:12.390
"a particle with a particular
position and momentum.",00:48:12.390,00:48:17.500
"So what is the
analogous thing here?",00:48:17.500,00:48:20.340
"And you know that in
new quantum mechanics,",00:48:20.340,00:48:23.570
"the interpretation of many
things is probabilistic.",00:48:23.570,00:48:26.830
"And in statistical
mechanics, even classically",00:48:29.350,00:48:32.490
"we had a probabilistic
interpretation.",00:48:32.490,00:48:35.610
"So presumably, we want to
build a probabilistic theory",00:48:35.610,00:48:40.020
"on top of another
probabilistic theory.",00:48:40.020,00:48:43.580
"So how do we go
about understanding",00:48:43.580,00:48:46.480
"precisely what is
happening over here?",00:48:46.480,00:48:49.950
"So let's kind of
remind ourselves",00:48:49.950,00:48:53.840
"of what we were doing in the
original classical statistical",00:48:53.840,00:48:58.400
"mechanics, and try to
see how we can make",00:48:58.400,00:49:01.740
"the corresponding
calculations when",00:49:01.740,00:49:03.930
things are quantum mechanical.,00:49:03.930,00:49:06.900
"So, essentially, the
probabilistic sense",00:49:06.900,00:49:11.210
"that we had in classical
statistical mechanics",00:49:11.210,00:49:15.150
"was to assign probabilities
for micro states, given",00:49:15.150,00:49:18.790
"that we had some knowledge
of the macro state.",00:49:18.790,00:49:21.950
"So the classical
microstate mu was a point",00:49:21.950,00:49:39.350
"which was a collection of
p's and q's in phase space.",00:49:39.350,00:49:44.368
So what is a quantum microstate?,00:49:51.690,00:50:01.000
OK.,00:50:01.000,00:50:01.500
"So here, I'm just going to jump
several decades ahead, and just",00:50:01.500,00:50:13.160
write the answer.,00:50:13.160,00:50:14.570
"And I'm going to
do it in somewhat",00:50:14.570,00:50:17.560
"of a more axiomatic way,
because it's not up to me",00:50:17.560,00:50:21.369
to introduce quantum mechanics.,00:50:21.369,00:50:22.660
"I assume that you
know it already.",00:50:22.660,00:50:25.190
"Just a perspective
that I'm going to take.",00:50:25.190,00:50:28.010
"So the quantum microstate
is a complex unit vector",00:50:28.010,00:50:40.020
in Hilbert space.,00:50:40.020,00:50:40.880
OK?,00:50:47.810,00:50:49.440
"So for any vector space, we can
choose a set of unit vectors",00:50:49.440,00:51:00.770
that form an orthonormal basis.,00:51:00.770,00:51:02.710
"And I'm going to use
this bra-ket notation.",00:51:09.028,00:51:13.630
"And so our psi, which is
a vector in this space,",00:51:13.630,00:51:20.580
"can be written in
terms of its components",00:51:20.580,00:51:25.680
"by pointing to the different
directions in this space,",00:51:25.680,00:51:30.160
"and components that I will
indicate by this psi n.",00:51:30.160,00:51:37.790
And these are complex.,00:51:37.790,00:51:40.650
"And I will use the
notation that psi n",00:51:45.500,00:51:51.810
"is the complex
conjugate of n psi.",00:51:51.810,00:51:55.630
"And the norm of this I'm going
to indicate by psi psi, which",00:51:58.980,00:52:06.480
"is obtained by summing over
all n psi psi n star, which",00:52:06.480,00:52:12.260
"is essentially the
magnitude of n psi squared.",00:52:12.260,00:52:17.280
And these are unit vectors.,00:52:17.280,00:52:20.190
"So all of these states
are normalized such",00:52:20.190,00:52:23.240
that psi psi is equal to 1.,00:52:23.240,00:52:25.960
Yes.,00:52:31.130,00:52:32.260
"AUDIENCE: You're not
allowing particle numbers",00:52:32.260,00:52:35.397
"to vary, are you?",00:52:35.397,00:52:36.770
"PROFESSOR: At this stage, no.",00:52:36.770,00:52:38.150
"Later on, when we do
the grand canonical,",00:52:38.150,00:52:40.820
"we will change
our Hilbert space.",00:52:40.820,00:52:43.850
OK?,00:52:58.480,00:53:00.220
So that's one concept.,00:53:00.220,00:53:03.030
"The other concept,
classically, we measure things.",00:53:03.030,00:53:06.820
So we have classical observable.,00:53:06.820,00:53:08.690
"And these are
functions all of which",00:53:17.100,00:53:23.720
"depend on this p and
q in phase space.",00:53:23.720,00:53:27.750
"So basically, there's
the phase space.",00:53:33.510,00:53:36.510
"We can have some
particular function,",00:53:36.510,00:53:39.270
"such as the kinetic energy--
sum over i pi squared",00:53:39.270,00:53:42.670
"over 2 n-- that's an
example of an observable.",00:53:42.670,00:53:46.220
"Kinetic energy, potential
energy, anything that we like,",00:53:46.220,00:53:49.920
"you can classically
write a sum function",00:53:49.920,00:53:52.440
"that you want to
evaluate in phase space,",00:53:52.440,00:53:54.880
"given that you are at some
particular point in phase",00:53:54.880,00:53:57.740
"space, the state of your system,
you can evaluate what that is.",00:53:57.740,00:54:02.720
"Now in quantum
mechanics, observables",00:54:02.720,00:54:10.850
"are operators, or matrices, if
you like, in this vector space.",00:54:10.850,00:54:29.260
OK?,00:54:29.260,00:54:30.650
"So among the
various observables,",00:54:30.650,00:54:37.310
"certainly, are things
like the position",00:54:37.310,00:54:39.210
"and the momentum
of the particle.",00:54:39.210,00:54:41.760
"So there are presumably
matrices that",00:54:41.760,00:54:43.670
"correspond to
position and momentum.",00:54:43.670,00:54:47.850
"And for that, we look
at some other properties",00:54:47.850,00:54:52.830
"that this classical
systems have.",00:54:52.830,00:54:56.650
"We had defined classically
a Poisson bracket,",00:54:56.650,00:55:03.210
"which was a sum over all
alphas d a by d q alpha",00:55:03.210,00:55:10.940
"d b by d p alpha minus the a
by the p alpha b d by the q f.",00:55:10.940,00:55:21.145
OK?,00:55:21.145,00:55:21.645
"And this is an
operation that you",00:55:24.500,00:55:29.210
"would like to, and happens
to, carry over in some sense",00:55:29.210,00:55:33.050
into quantum mechanics.,00:55:33.050,00:55:37.220
"But one of the
consequence of this",00:55:37.220,00:55:40.000
"is you can check if I pick
a particular momentum, key,",00:55:40.000,00:55:45.470
"and a particular coordinate,
q, and put it over here, most",00:55:45.470,00:55:52.840
"of the time I will get 0,
unless the alphas match",00:55:52.840,00:55:57.140
"exactly the p q's
that I have up there.",00:55:57.140,00:56:00.540
"And if you go through
this whole thing,",00:56:00.540,00:56:02.940
"I will get something like
that is like a delta i j.",00:56:02.940,00:56:08.610
OK.,00:56:08.610,00:56:10.610
"So this structure somehow
continues in quantum mechanics,",00:56:10.610,00:56:16.590
"in this sense that the matrices
that correspond to p and q",00:56:16.590,00:56:22.050
"satisfy the condition
that p i and q j,",00:56:22.050,00:56:33.240
"thinking of two matrices,
and this is the commutator,",00:56:33.240,00:56:38.200
"so this is p i q j minus q j
p i is h bar over i delta h.",00:56:38.200,00:56:50.786
"So once you have the matrices
that correspond to p and q,",00:56:57.570,00:57:04.710
"you can take any function of p
and q that you had over here,",00:57:04.710,00:57:11.370
"and then replace the p's and
q's that appear in, let's say,",00:57:11.370,00:57:16.510
"a series expansion, or an
expansion of this o in powers",00:57:16.510,00:57:20.020
"of p and q, with corresponding
matrices p hat and q hat.",00:57:20.020,00:57:24.840
"And that way, you will construct
a corresponding operator.",00:57:24.840,00:57:28.980
"There is one subtlety that
you've probably encountered,",00:57:28.980,00:57:32.240
"in that there is
some symmetrization",00:57:32.240,00:57:34.480
"that you have to do before
you can make this replacement.",00:57:34.480,00:57:38.130
OK.,00:57:40.770,00:57:42.070
So what does it mean?,00:57:42.070,00:57:45.386
"In classical theory, if
something is observable",00:57:45.386,00:57:51.130
"the answer that you
get is a number.",00:57:51.130,00:57:52.720
Right?,00:57:52.720,00:57:53.220
"You can calculate what
the kinetic energy is.",00:57:53.220,00:57:56.180
"In quantum mechanics,
what does it",00:57:56.180,00:57:59.030
"mean that observable
is a matrix?",00:57:59.030,00:58:03.600
"The statement is
that observables",00:58:03.600,00:58:06.530
"don't have definite values,
but the expectation value",00:58:06.530,00:58:15.210
"of a particular observable
o in some state pi",00:58:15.210,00:58:22.310
is given by psi o psi.,00:58:22.310,00:58:26.340
"Essentially, you take the vector
that correspond to the state,",00:58:26.340,00:58:31.010
"multiply the matrix on
it, and then sandwich it",00:58:31.010,00:58:34.520
"with the conjugate
of the vector,",00:58:34.520,00:58:36.850
"and that will give
you your state.",00:58:36.850,00:58:38.365
"So in terms of elements
of some particular basis,",00:58:38.365,00:58:43.880
"you would write this
as a sum over n and m.",00:58:43.880,00:58:47.610
Psi n n o m m psi.,00:58:47.610,00:58:53.200
"And in that particular
basis, your operator",00:58:57.280,00:59:02.820
"would have these
matrix elements.",00:59:02.820,00:59:04.630
"Now again, another
property, if you're",00:59:07.160,00:59:10.970
"measuring something
that is observable,",00:59:10.970,00:59:13.630
"is presumably you will
get a number that is real.",00:59:13.630,00:59:17.200
"That is, you expect this
to be the same thing",00:59:17.200,00:59:21.450
as its complex conjugate.,00:59:21.450,00:59:24.790
"And if you follow
this condition,",00:59:24.790,00:59:27.940
"you will see that that reality
implies that n o m should",00:59:27.940,00:59:34.490
"m o n complex conjugate,
which is typically written",00:59:34.490,00:59:41.940
"as the matrix being its
Hermitian conjugate,",00:59:41.940,00:59:46.039
or being Hermitian.,00:59:46.039,00:59:46.830
"So all observables
in quantum mechanics",00:59:51.190,00:59:54.510
"would correspond to Hermitian
operators or matrices.",00:59:54.510,00:59:58.665
OK.,01:00:01.761,01:00:02.260
"There's one other
piece, and then we",01:00:04.810,01:00:06.730
can forget about axioms.,01:00:06.730,01:00:14.430
"We have a classical
time evolution.",01:00:14.430,01:00:19.950
"We know that the particular
point in the classical phase",01:00:26.930,01:00:30.530
"space changes as a
function of time, such",01:00:30.530,01:00:33.410
"that q i dot is
plus d h by d p i.",01:00:33.410,01:00:40.440
P i dot is minus d h by d q i.,01:00:40.440,01:00:46.190
"By the way, both of these
can be written as q i",01:00:46.190,01:00:49.920
"and h Poisson bracket and
p i and h Poisson bracket.",01:00:49.920,01:00:55.630

the classical evolution.",01:01:01.720,01:01:07.660
"And when we go to
quantum evolution,",01:01:07.660,01:01:13.800

Hilbert space evolves according",01:01:13.800,01:01:19.480

"is the matrix that we
have acting on psi.",01:01:26.550,01:01:30.716
OK.,01:01:34.900,01:01:36.541
Fine.,01:01:36.541,01:01:37.040
"So these are the
basics that we need.",01:01:37.040,01:01:40.584
"Now we can go and do
statistical descriptions.",01:01:40.584,01:01:45.880
"So the main element that we
had in constructing statistical",01:01:53.100,01:02:04.540
"descriptions was deal
with a macrostate.",01:02:04.540,01:02:07.666
"We said that if I'm
interested in thinking",01:02:15.850,01:02:18.440
"about the properties of
one cubic meter of gas",01:02:18.440,01:02:22.760
"at standard temperature
and pressure,",01:02:22.760,01:02:25.960
"I'm not thinking about a
particular point in phase",01:02:25.960,01:02:29.340
"space, because
different gases that",01:02:29.340,01:02:32.020
"have exactly the same
macroscopic properties would",01:02:32.020,01:02:35.300
"correspond to many, many
different possible points",01:02:35.300,01:02:38.100
"in this phase space that are
changing as a function of time.",01:02:38.100,01:02:42.060
"So rather than thinking
about a single microstate,",01:02:42.060,01:02:47.850
we talked about an ensemble.,01:02:47.850,01:02:50.740
"And this ensemble had a whole
bunch of possible microstates.",01:02:50.740,01:03:00.280
"In the simplest
prescription, maybe we",01:03:00.280,01:03:02.340
"said they were all
equally likely.",01:03:02.340,01:03:06.280
"But, actually, we could even
assign some kind of probability",01:03:06.280,01:03:09.560
to them.,01:03:09.560,01:03:10.060
"And we want to know what to do
with this, because then what",01:03:13.740,01:03:19.430
"happened was from
this description,",01:03:19.430,01:03:24.130
"we then constructed a
density which was, again,",01:03:24.130,01:03:31.150
"some kind of a probability
in phase space.",01:03:31.150,01:03:36.170
"And we looked at
its time evolution.",01:03:36.170,01:03:38.690
"We looked at the averages
and all kinds of things",01:03:38.690,01:03:42.140
in terms of this density.,01:03:42.140,01:03:45.250
"So the question is, what
happens to all of this",01:03:45.250,01:03:50.340
"when we go to
quantum descriptions?",01:03:50.340,01:03:55.070
OK.,01:03:55.070,01:03:55.930
You can follow a lot of that.,01:03:55.930,01:03:58.700
"We can, again, take the example
of the one cubic meter of gas",01:03:58.700,01:04:04.640
"at standard temperature
and pressure.",01:04:04.640,01:04:07.430
"But the rather than describing
the state of the system",01:04:07.430,01:04:11.380
"classically, I can
try to describe it",01:04:11.380,01:04:13.750
quantum mechanically.,01:04:13.750,01:04:15.930
"Presumably the quantum
mechanical description",01:04:15.930,01:04:18.140
"at some limit becomes equivalent
to the classical description.",01:04:18.140,01:04:21.930
"So I will have an
ensemble of states.",01:04:21.930,01:04:28.005
"I don't know which
one of them I am in.",01:04:30.820,01:04:33.940
I have lots of boxes.,01:04:33.940,01:04:35.360
"They would correspond to
different microstates,",01:04:35.360,01:04:39.710
presumably.,01:04:39.710,01:04:41.480
"And this has,
actually, a word that",01:04:41.480,01:04:45.790
"is used more in the
quantum context.",01:04:45.790,01:04:48.010
"I guess one could use it
in the classical context.",01:04:48.010,01:04:50.400
It's called a mixed state.,01:04:50.400,01:04:53.570
"A pure state is one
you know exactly.",01:04:53.570,01:04:57.270
"Mixed state is, well,
like the gas I tell you.",01:04:57.270,01:05:00.740
"I tell you only the
macroscopic information,",01:05:00.740,01:05:03.430
"you don't know much about
microscopically what it is.",01:05:03.430,01:05:06.340
"If these are possibilities,
and not knowing",01:05:06.340,01:05:09.470
"those possibilities,
you can say that it's",01:05:09.470,01:05:11.510
a mixture of all these states.,01:05:11.510,01:05:14.960
OK.,01:05:14.960,01:05:16.830
"Now, what would I use,
classically, a density for?",01:05:16.830,01:05:21.490
"What I could do is
I could calculate",01:05:21.490,01:05:24.700
"the average of some observable,
classically, in this ensemble.",01:05:24.700,01:05:34.530
"And what I would do
is I would integrate",01:05:34.530,01:05:37.990
"over the entirety of the six
n-dimensional phase space",01:05:37.990,01:05:43.470
"the o at some particular
point in phase space",01:05:43.470,01:05:47.850
"and the density at that
point in phase space.",01:05:47.850,01:05:51.540
"And this average I
will indicate by a bar.",01:05:51.540,01:05:56.920
"So my bars stand for
ensemble average,",01:05:56.920,01:06:03.770
"to make them distinct from
these quantum averages",01:06:03.770,01:06:08.100
"that I will indicate
with the Bra-Kets.",01:06:08.100,01:06:11.880
OK?,01:06:11.880,01:06:14.180
"So let's try to do the analogue
of that in quantum states.",01:06:14.180,01:06:20.880
"I would say that, OK, for a
particular one of the members",01:06:20.880,01:06:25.740
"of this ensemble,
I can calculate",01:06:25.740,01:06:28.410
what the expectation value is.,01:06:28.410,01:06:30.410
"This is the
expectation value that",01:06:33.260,01:06:37.310
"corresponds to this observable
o, if I was in a pure state psi",01:06:37.310,01:06:42.800
alpha.,01:06:42.800,01:06:44.620
"But I don't know
that I am there.",01:06:44.620,01:06:48.370
"I have a probability,
so I do a summation",01:06:48.370,01:06:52.780
over all of these states.,01:06:52.780,01:06:54.850
"And I will call that expectation
value ensemble average.",01:06:54.850,01:06:58.660
"So that's how
things are defined.",01:07:03.930,01:07:07.770
"Let's look at this in
some particular basis.",01:07:07.770,01:07:11.280
"I would write this as a sum
over alpha m and n p alpha psi",01:07:11.280,01:07:19.780
alpha m m o n n psi alpha.,01:07:19.780,01:07:28.350
"So, essentially, writing
all of these psis",01:07:28.350,01:07:33.060
"in terms of their components,
just as I had done above.",01:07:33.060,01:07:38.290
OK.,01:07:38.290,01:07:39.920
"Now what I want to do
is to reorder this.",01:07:39.920,01:07:44.080
"Do the summation
over n and m first,",01:07:44.080,01:07:48.350
the summation over alpha last.,01:07:48.350,01:07:50.380
So what do I have?,01:07:50.380,01:07:52.395
I have m o n.,01:07:52.395,01:07:57.670
"And then I have a sum over
alpha of p alpha n psi alpha",01:07:57.670,01:08:06.850
psi alpha n.,01:08:06.850,01:08:07.810
"So what I will do, this quantity
that alpha is summed over--",01:08:14.290,01:08:23.359
"so it depends on the
two indices n and m.",01:08:23.359,01:08:26.939
I can give it a name.,01:08:26.939,01:08:28.550
I can call it n rho m.,01:08:28.550,01:08:31.430
"If I do that, then this o
bar average becomes simply--",01:08:35.550,01:08:41.600
let's see.,01:08:41.600,01:08:43.819
"This summation over n gives
me the matrix product o rho.",01:08:43.819,01:08:50.560
"And then summation over m gives
me the trace of the product.",01:08:50.560,01:08:54.790
So this is the trace of rho o.,01:08:54.790,01:08:57.221
OK?,01:08:59.987,01:09:02.300
"So I constructed
something that is",01:09:02.300,01:09:09.850
"kind of analogous
to the classical use",01:09:09.850,01:09:16.260
of the density in phase space.,01:09:16.260,01:09:20.930
"So you would multiply
the density and the thing",01:09:20.930,01:09:23.850
"that you wanted to
calculate the observable.",01:09:23.850,01:09:28.310
"And the ensemble
average is obtained",01:09:28.310,01:09:31.290
"as a kind of summing over
all possible what values",01:09:31.290,01:09:34.710
of that product in phase space.,01:09:34.710,01:09:37.550
"So here, I'm doing
something similar.",01:09:37.550,01:09:40.729
"I'm multiplying this
o by some matrix row.",01:09:40.729,01:09:45.109
"So, again, this I can think
of as having introduced",01:09:45.109,01:09:52.370
a new matrix for an operator.,01:09:52.370,01:09:55.630
And this is the density matrix.,01:09:55.630,01:09:57.510
"And if I basically
ignore, or write it",01:10:07.520,01:10:12.910
"in basis-independent
form, it is obtained",01:10:12.910,01:10:16.610
"by summing over all
alphas the alphas,",01:10:16.610,01:10:20.620
"and, essentially,
cutting off the n and m.",01:10:20.620,01:10:23.710
"I have the matrix that I would
form out of state alpha by,",01:10:23.710,01:10:31.710
"essentially, taking the
vector and its conjugate",01:10:31.710,01:10:35.370
"and multiplying rows and columns
together to make a matrix.",01:10:35.370,01:10:41.710
"And then multiplying or
averaging that matrix",01:10:41.710,01:10:44.790
"over all possible
values of the ensemble--",01:10:44.790,01:10:48.270
"elements of the ensemble--
would give me this density.",01:10:48.270,01:10:52.640
"So in the same way
that any observable",01:10:52.640,01:10:59.060
"in classical mechanics goes
over to an operator in quantum",01:10:59.060,01:11:07.200
"mechanics, we find that
we have another function",01:11:07.200,01:11:10.920
in phase space-- this density.,01:11:10.920,01:11:13.260
"This density goes over to the
matrix or an operator that",01:11:13.260,01:11:17.320
is given by this formula here.,01:11:17.320,01:11:18.770
"It is useful to enumerate
some properties of the density",01:11:21.330,01:11:26.958
matrix.,01:11:26.958,01:11:27.458
"First of all, the density
matrix is positive definite.",01:11:44.940,01:11:55.150
What does that mean?,01:11:55.150,01:11:56.492
"It means that if you
take the density matrix,",01:11:56.492,01:12:01.430
"multiply it by any state
on the right and the left",01:12:01.430,01:12:07.780
"to construct a number, this
number will be positive,",01:12:07.780,01:12:12.780
"because if I apply it to the
formula that I have over there,",01:12:12.780,01:12:16.570
"this is simply sum
over alpha p alpha.",01:12:16.570,01:12:19.750
"Then I have phi psi
psi alpha, and them",01:12:19.750,01:12:25.910
"psi alpha psi, which is
its complex conjugate.",01:12:25.910,01:12:29.440
"So I get the norm of that
product, which is positive.",01:12:29.440,01:12:34.690
"All of the p alphas are
positive probabilities.",01:12:34.690,01:12:39.140
"So this is certainly
something that is positive.",01:12:39.140,01:12:43.890
"We said that anything that
makes sense in quantum mechanics",01:12:43.890,01:12:50.780
should be Hermitian.,01:12:50.780,01:12:51.850
And it is easy to check.,01:12:55.720,01:12:58.630
"That if I take this
operator rho and do",01:12:58.630,01:13:02.350
"the complex conjugate,
essentially what happens",01:13:02.350,01:13:06.010
"is that I have to
take sum over alpha.",01:13:06.010,01:13:08.540
"Complex conjugate of p
alpha is p alpha itself.",01:13:08.540,01:13:11.520
Probabilities are real numbers.,01:13:11.520,01:13:14.270
"If I take psi alpha psi alpha
and conjugate it, essentially",01:13:14.270,01:13:19.940
I take this and put it here.,01:13:19.940,01:13:21.510
"And I take that and
put it over there.",01:13:21.510,01:13:23.450
And I get the same thing.,01:13:23.450,01:13:24.985
So it's the same thing as rho.,01:13:24.985,01:13:26.620
"And, finally, there's
a normalization.",01:13:29.920,01:13:32.706
"If, for my o over here in
the last formula, I choose 1,",01:13:41.720,01:13:48.170
"then I get the
expectation value of 1",01:13:48.170,01:13:52.790
has to be the trace of rho.,01:13:52.790,01:13:57.050
"And we can check that
the trace of rho,",01:13:57.050,01:14:00.250
"essentially, is
obtained by summing over",01:14:00.250,01:14:02.760
"all alpha p alpha, and the dot
product of the two psi alphas.",01:14:02.760,01:14:08.960
"Since any state in
quantum mechanics",01:14:08.960,01:14:13.280
"corresponds to a unit
vector, this is 1.",01:14:13.280,01:14:17.660
"So I get a sum over
alpha of p alphas.",01:14:17.660,01:14:21.532
"And these are
probabilities assigned",01:14:21.532,01:14:24.280
to the members of the ensemble.,01:14:24.280,01:14:25.830
They have to add up to 1.,01:14:25.830,01:14:28.060
And so this is like this.,01:14:28.060,01:14:30.010
"So the quantity that
we were looking at,",01:14:32.840,01:14:40.960
"and built, essentially, all of
our later classical statistical",01:14:40.960,01:14:46.600
"mechanics, on is this density.",01:14:46.600,01:14:50.500
"Density was a probability
in phase space.",01:14:50.500,01:14:54.630
"Now, when you go to
quantum mechanics,",01:14:54.630,01:14:56.810
we don't have phase space.,01:14:56.810,01:14:58.360
We have Hilbert space.,01:14:58.360,01:15:00.650
"We already have a
probabilistic theory.",01:15:00.650,01:15:03.680
"Turns out that this
function, which",01:15:03.680,01:15:07.450
"was the probability in
phase space classically,",01:15:07.450,01:15:10.240
"gets promoted to this matrix,
the density matrix, that has,",01:15:10.240,01:15:15.080
"once you take traces and
do all kinds of things,",01:15:15.080,01:15:17.990
"the kinds of properties that
you would expect the probability",01:15:17.990,01:15:21.020
to have classically.,01:15:21.020,01:15:22.660
"But it's not really
probability in the usual sense.",01:15:22.660,01:15:26.200
It's a matrix.,01:15:26.200,01:15:28.810
OK.,01:15:28.810,01:15:31.060
"There is one other thing
element of this to go through,",01:15:31.060,01:15:37.350
"which is that
classically, we said",01:15:37.350,01:15:44.450
"that, OK, I pick
a set of states.",01:15:44.450,01:15:49.670
They correspond to some density.,01:15:49.670,01:15:52.170
"But the microstates are
changing as a function of time.",01:15:52.170,01:15:55.960
"So the density was changing
as a function of time.",01:15:55.960,01:15:59.510
"And we had Liouville's
theorem, which",01:15:59.510,01:16:07.190
"stated that d rho by d t
was the Poisson bracket",01:16:07.190,01:16:15.625
of the Hamiltonian with rho.,01:16:15.625,01:16:17.810
"So we can quantum
mechanically ask,",01:16:20.860,01:16:24.700
"what happens to
our density matrix?",01:16:24.700,01:16:28.630
So we have a matrix rho.,01:16:28.630,01:16:33.290
"I can ask, what is the time
derivative of that matrix?",01:16:33.290,01:16:38.400
"And, actually, I will
insert the i h bar here,",01:16:38.400,01:16:44.870
"because I anticipate
that, essentially,",01:16:44.870,01:16:51.130
"rho having that form, what I
will have is sum over alpha.",01:16:51.130,01:16:56.820
"And then I have i h bar d by
dt acting on these p alpha psi",01:16:56.820,01:17:06.870
alpha psi f.,01:17:06.870,01:17:08.560
"So there rho is sum over alpha
p alpha psi alpha psi alpha.",01:17:11.080,01:17:15.860
"Sum over alpha p alpha
I can take outside.",01:17:15.860,01:17:19.110
"I h bar d by dt acts
on these two psis",01:17:19.110,01:17:23.520
"that are appearing a
complex conjugates.",01:17:23.520,01:17:26.590
"So it can either, d by dt,
act on one or the other.",01:17:26.590,01:17:30.180
"So I can write this
as sum over alpha p",01:17:30.180,01:17:33.240
"alpha i h bar d by dt acting
on psi alpha psi alpha, or i,",01:17:33.240,01:17:45.320
"or psi alpha, and then i h bar d
by dt acting on this psi alpha.",01:17:45.320,01:17:56.466
"Now, i h bar d by
dt psi alpha, we",01:18:02.370,01:18:08.060
"said that, essentially, the
quantum rule for time evolution",01:18:08.060,01:18:13.620
"is i h bar d by dt
of the state will",01:18:13.620,01:18:16.490
"give you is governed by h
times acting on psi alpha.",01:18:16.490,01:18:21.656
"If I were to take the complex
conjugate of this expression,",01:18:24.830,01:18:31.220
"what I would get
is minus i h bar",01:18:31.220,01:18:35.690
"d by dt acting on
psi that is pointing",01:18:35.690,01:18:39.020
"the other way of our
complex conjugation",01:18:39.020,01:18:42.080
"is h acting on the psi
in the opposite way.",01:18:42.080,01:18:49.770
"So this thing is minus psi
alpha with h f acting on it.",01:18:49.770,01:19:05.493
OK.,01:19:09.270,01:19:10.520
"So then I can write the whole
thing as h-- for the first term",01:19:10.520,01:19:22.020
take the h out front.,01:19:22.020,01:19:24.230
"I have a sum over
alpha p alpha psi alpha",01:19:24.230,01:19:28.140
"psi alpha, minus, from this
complex conjugation-- here, h",01:19:28.140,01:19:37.000
"is completely to the right--
I have a sum over alpha",01:19:37.000,01:19:40.740
p alpha psi alpha psi alpha.,01:19:40.740,01:19:45.380
And then we have h.,01:19:45.380,01:19:46.969
"Now, these are again
getting rho back.",01:19:49.690,01:19:51.825
"So what I have established
is that i h bar, the time",01:19:56.463,01:20:04.490
"derivative of this
density matrix,",01:20:04.490,01:20:08.420
"is simply the commutator
of the operators h and o.",01:20:08.420,01:20:15.800
"So what we had up here was the
classical Liouville theorem,",01:20:20.960,01:20:31.140
"relating the time derivative
of the density in phase space",01:20:31.140,01:20:35.050
to the Poisson bracket with h.,01:20:35.050,01:20:37.860
"What we have here is the
quantum version, where",01:20:37.860,01:20:41.430
"the time derivative
of this density matrix",01:20:41.430,01:20:45.220
is the commutator of rho with h.,01:20:45.220,01:20:47.580
"Now we are done, because what
did we use this Liouville for?",01:20:52.340,01:20:59.550
"We used it to deduce that if
I have things that are not",01:20:59.550,01:21:04.290
"changing as a function of time,
I have equilibrium systems,",01:21:04.290,01:21:10.090
where the density is invariant.,01:21:10.090,01:21:12.590
It's the same.,01:21:12.590,01:21:14.180
"Then rho of equilibrium not
changing as a function of time",01:21:14.180,01:21:21.490
"can be achieved by simply
making it a function of h.",01:21:21.490,01:21:27.440
"And, more precisely, h
and conserved quantities",01:21:27.440,01:21:32.940
"that have 0 Poisson
bracket with h.",01:21:32.940,01:21:36.100
"How can I make the
quantum density matrix",01:21:43.700,01:21:47.330
to be invariant of time?,01:21:47.330,01:21:50.810
"All I need to do is to ensure
that the Poisson bracket",01:21:50.810,01:21:54.440
"of that density with
the Hamiltonian is 0.",01:21:54.440,01:21:58.350
"Not the Poisson
bracket, the commutator.",01:21:58.350,01:22:01.300
"Clearly, the commutator
of h with itself is 0.",01:22:01.300,01:22:04.560
Hh minus hh is 0.,01:22:04.560,01:22:07.510
"So this I can make
a function of h,",01:22:07.510,01:22:12.390
"and any other kind
of quantity also",01:22:12.390,01:22:15.270
that has 0 commutator with h.,01:22:15.270,01:22:18.610
"So, essentially, the quantum
version also applies.",01:22:18.610,01:22:22.100
"That is, the quantum
version of rho equilibrium,",01:22:22.100,01:22:26.810
"I can make it by
constructing something",01:22:26.810,01:22:30.350
"that depends on
the Hilbert space",01:22:30.350,01:22:34.420
"through the dependence
of the Hamiltonian",01:22:34.420,01:22:36.460
"and on the Hilbert space and any
other conserved quantities that",01:22:36.460,01:22:41.730
"have 0 commutator also
with the Hamiltonian.",01:22:41.730,01:22:45.436
"So now, what we
will do next time",01:22:49.440,01:22:53.130
"is we can pick and choose
whatever rho equilibrium",01:22:53.130,01:22:55.900
we had before.,01:22:55.900,01:22:56.680
Canonical e to the minus beta h.,01:22:56.680,01:22:59.560
"We make this matrix to
be e to the minus beta h.",01:22:59.560,01:23:02.930
"Uniform anything, we
can just carry over",01:23:02.930,01:23:06.710
"whatever functional dependence
we had here to here.",01:23:06.710,01:23:10.160
"And we are ensure
to have something",01:23:10.160,01:23:13.240
"that is quantum
mechanically invariant.",01:23:13.240,01:23:16.280
"And we will then interpret
what the various quantities",01:23:16.280,01:23:21.120
"calculated through that
density matrix and the formulas",01:23:21.120,01:23:25.620
that we described actually.,01:23:25.620,01:23:29.060
