"can interpret this in the same
way as you interpret this.",00:03:39.570,00:03:43.970
"This is independent of the
state that you start in.",00:03:43.970,00:03:47.180
"These probabilities here, these
fractions of time in",00:03:49.940,00:03:52.700
"each state, are independent
of where you start.",00:03:52.700,00:03:55.740
"So Mi of t is a sample path,
average rate at which",00:03:55.740,00:03:59.450
"transitions occur with
probability 1.",00:03:59.450,00:04:03.410

start, and no matter what",00:04:03.410,00:04:10.710
"sample path you're looking at
with probability one, what you",00:04:10.710,00:04:14.440
"wind up with is a number of
transitions up to time t",00:04:14.440,00:04:19.010
"divided by t, which goes to a
limit of probability one, and",00:04:19.010,00:04:24.130
"it's independent of the
starting state.",00:04:24.130,00:04:26.380
"OK, so if this sum here is
infinite then something",00:04:26.380,00:04:37.700
"peculiar is happening because
when this sum is infinite,",00:04:37.700,00:04:42.190
"even though the pi sub j's are
positive, even though the",00:04:42.190,00:04:45.610
"embedded Markov chain is
positive recurrent, these",00:04:45.610,00:04:50.720
"fractions of time in
each state don't",00:04:50.720,00:04:53.230
make any sense anymore.,00:04:53.230,00:04:55.530
"So that in fact, what you have
is a Markov process which is",00:04:55.530,00:05:01.690
"getting slower and slower
and slower.",00:05:01.690,00:05:03.900
"That's what this equals
infinity means.",00:05:07.380,00:05:09.620
"It means that these pi sub k's,
the probability of being",00:05:09.620,00:05:13.180
"in certain states
with very high--",00:05:13.180,00:05:15.690
"If the probability is being high
of states where you spend",00:05:19.440,00:05:24.200
"a long time in those states
and that sum adds up to",00:05:24.200,00:05:27.350
"infinity, this transition
rate is equal to zero.",00:05:27.350,00:05:31.660
"It means that the transitions
rates are getting slower and",00:05:31.660,00:05:34.190
"slower and slower, we showed an
example of that of an mm1q.",00:05:34.190,00:05:39.470
"Well, it wasn't quite mm1, but
it was like an mm1q, but it",00:05:39.470,00:05:43.940
"had the property that as you
moved up to higher and higher",00:05:43.940,00:05:50.040
"states, both arrivals got slower
and slower, and also",00:05:50.040,00:05:54.880
"the service time got
slower and slower.",00:05:54.880,00:05:56.780
"We called this a rattled
server, and",00:05:56.780,00:06:01.160
also discouraged arrival.,00:06:01.160,00:06:02.680
"So with the two of those things,
as you move up to",00:06:02.680,00:06:05.820
"higher and higher states, what
happens is transitions get",00:06:05.820,00:06:10.050
"slower and slower and
eventually, you settle down in",00:06:10.050,00:06:12.990
"a situation where nothing
is getting done.",00:06:12.990,00:06:16.890
"And that's because
of the sum here.",00:06:16.890,00:06:18.440
"It's not because of anything
peculiar in",00:06:18.440,00:06:20.840
any one given state.,00:06:20.840,00:06:22.120
"Let's see, where we're we?",00:06:27.580,00:06:28.780
"OK, if this is equal to
infinity, the transition rate",00:06:28.780,00:06:31.960
"goes to 0 and the process has
no meaningful steady state.",00:06:31.960,00:06:35.160
"Otherwise, the steady
state uniquely",00:06:35.160,00:06:37.430
satisfies this equation.,00:06:37.430,00:06:39.340
"That's what we showed
less time.",00:06:39.340,00:06:42.060
"This says that the rate in
equals the rate out for each",00:06:42.060,00:06:45.150
"state, that's what this
equation says.",00:06:45.150,00:06:48.760
"This quantity over here p sub
j is the probability that",00:06:48.760,00:06:52.620
"you're in state j, at any
given time, nu sub j is",00:06:52.620,00:06:56.480
"expected amount of time
you stay in there.",00:06:56.480,00:06:59.390
"So this is the, in a sense, this
product here corresponds",00:06:59.390,00:07:08.710
to the rate in state j.,00:07:08.710,00:07:11.840
"The sum over here corresponds
to the rate at which you're",00:07:11.840,00:07:14.870
going into state j.,00:07:14.870,00:07:16.880
"All of these P's are greater
than 0, and the sum of the P's",00:07:16.880,00:07:20.740
are equal to 1.,00:07:20.740,00:07:22.600
"This is the case though we
normally call a positive",00:07:22.600,00:07:26.200
recurrent process.,00:07:26.200,00:07:27.290
"I notice I didn't define
that in the notes.",00:07:27.290,00:07:30.250
"I now notice, thinking about
it even more, that I'm not",00:07:30.250,00:07:32.700
"sure I want to define it that
way, but anyway that's what",00:07:32.700,00:07:36.100
it's usually called.,00:07:36.100,00:07:37.060
"It's called a positive
recurrent process.",00:07:37.060,00:07:39.540
"It requires both that this is
less than infinity and the",00:07:39.540,00:07:46.290
"steady state probabilities
pi sub j have a solution.",00:07:46.290,00:07:51.580
"If you have a birth/death
process, you can deal with the",00:07:51.580,00:07:54.510
"birth/death process in exactly
the same way as we dealt with",00:07:54.510,00:07:58.860
birth/death Markov chains.,00:07:58.860,00:08:00.810
"Namely, what goes up must
eventually come down.",00:08:00.810,00:08:05.120
"And what that means is a P sub
j, this is the fraction of",00:08:05.120,00:08:10.080
time you're in state j.,00:08:10.080,00:08:12.010
"This is the rate at which you
move up, so this combination",00:08:12.010,00:08:15.690
"here is the overall rate at
which you're moving up, not",00:08:15.690,00:08:19.690
"conditional on being
in state j.",00:08:19.690,00:08:21.720
"This is the overall probability
of moving down.",00:08:21.720,00:08:25.460
"So the transition rate up, in
any given state, equals the",00:08:25.460,00:08:29.960
transition rate down.,00:08:29.960,00:08:32.539
"OK, so that's a useful
equation.",00:08:32.539,00:08:35.309
"That's the way you
usually solve",00:08:35.309,00:08:36.845
for birth/death processes.,00:08:36.845,00:08:39.159
"The same as you use for solving
for change, you can",00:08:39.159,00:08:41.770
"get it from the chain equation
very easily.",00:08:41.770,00:08:46.440
"If you have an irreducible
process, an irreducible",00:08:46.440,00:08:49.400
"process is one where every state
communicates with every",00:08:49.400,00:08:52.540
"other state, remember?",00:08:52.540,00:08:54.650
"Same as the definition
for change.",00:08:54.650,00:08:57.190
"If there is a solution to these
equations here, mainly,",00:08:57.190,00:09:02.000
"these are the equations where
you directly solved for the",00:09:02.000,00:09:05.860
average time in each state.,00:09:05.860,00:09:07.625
"The time spent in blah,
blah, blah--",00:09:12.280,00:09:16.760
"What this is saying again, is
the rate at which you leave",00:09:24.410,00:09:28.850
"state j is what this is, is
equal to the rate at which you",00:09:28.850,00:09:33.030
"enter state j, which
is what this is.",00:09:33.030,00:09:35.770
"So this again, is saying what
comes in must go out.",00:09:35.770,00:09:40.760
"And if this equation is
satisfied, then the embedded",00:09:40.760,00:09:43.640
"chain is positive recurrent and
instead of solving for the",00:09:43.640,00:09:49.700
"P's from the pi's, you're
solving for the pi's from the",00:09:49.700,00:09:52.830
"P. It's the same kind
of equation.",00:09:52.830,00:09:55.400
"Notice before P sub j was equal
to pi sub j over nu sub",00:09:55.400,00:09:59.995
j normalized.,00:09:59.995,00:10:02.030
"Now, pi sub j is equal
to a P sub j, nu sub",00:10:02.030,00:10:04.995
j normalized again.,00:10:04.995,00:10:06.930
"And you normalize this because
the rate at which transitions",00:10:06.930,00:10:09.910
"are taking place is
normally not 1.",00:10:09.910,00:10:12.950
"We also found that this rate
at which transitions are",00:10:17.660,00:10:23.480
"taking place, 1 over this
quantity, is also equal to",00:10:23.480,00:10:27.570
this sum here.,00:10:27.570,00:10:28.420
"So the sum of Pj nu sub j is
the overall rate at which",00:10:28.420,00:10:32.490
transitions are taking place.,00:10:32.490,00:10:35.040
"Now, if the sum of nu i times
p sub i is infinite then,",00:10:35.040,00:10:40.370
"according to this formula, each
pi sub j is equal to 0,",00:10:40.370,00:10:44.740
"which says that the embedded
Markov chain has to be either",00:10:44.740,00:10:50.170
"transient or is null-recurrent,
and something",00:10:50.170,00:10:56.430
"very, very strange
is going on.",00:10:56.430,00:10:58.410
"Because here we've solved these
equations, we found",00:10:58.410,00:11:03.800
"positive P sub j's, positive
probabilities of being in each",00:11:03.800,00:11:07.860
"state or, at least, that's the
way we try to interpret it.",00:11:07.860,00:11:11.020
"And then we find that as far
as the transition rates are",00:11:11.020,00:11:15.330
"concerned all of the
transition rates",00:11:15.330,00:11:18.660
are equal to 0.,00:11:18.660,00:11:19.640
So what's going on?,00:11:19.640,00:11:23.090
"I must admit frankly, I don't
know what's going on.",00:11:23.090,00:11:26.260
"Because, I mean, I know
mathematically",00:11:26.260,00:11:30.030
what's going on.,00:11:30.030,00:11:30.860
"This is what the
equations say.",00:11:30.860,00:11:32.850
"There's a nice example of it,
which I'll look at in the next",00:11:32.850,00:11:35.560
"slide, but to interpret this in
any very satisfactory way",00:11:35.560,00:11:39.930
seems to be very hard.,00:11:39.930,00:11:41.730
"OK, here's the example, and
we talked about this a",00:11:41.730,00:11:44.970
little bit last time.,00:11:44.970,00:11:46.940
"If we look at the embedded
chain, we can call this a",00:11:46.940,00:11:50.070
hyperactive birth/death chain.,00:11:50.070,00:11:52.600
"It's hyperactive in the sense
that the higher the state gets",00:11:52.600,00:11:56.570
the faster the thing runs.,00:11:56.570,00:11:58.300
"So as you get more customers
into this queue, you could",00:12:00.890,00:12:04.380
"imagine then the server
runs faster, the",00:12:04.380,00:12:08.400
customers arrive faster.,00:12:08.400,00:12:10.160
"And as it builds up, this keeps
on going faster and",00:12:10.160,00:12:14.010
faster and faster.,00:12:14.010,00:12:15.520
"For this chain, it looks like
it's stable, doesn't it?",00:12:15.520,00:12:19.750
"Because the probability
of going up--",00:12:19.750,00:12:23.290
"No, it looks like
it's not stable.",00:12:23.290,00:12:25.980
"The probability of
going up is 0.6.",00:12:25.980,00:12:28.190

go out, and the only thing",00:12:37.970,00:12:42.290
"that could happen is the
queue builds up.",00:12:42.290,00:12:45.380

up, the rate at which",00:13:36.830,00:13:40.040

to happen is that you're",00:17:11.700,00:17:15.859

the higher states.",00:17:15.859,00:17:19.520

the number of states that",00:17:24.910,00:17:27.910

move up one on which states",00:17:36.940,00:17:41.900
are most likely.,00:17:41.900,00:17:44.060

here 2/3 to the k minus j,",00:17:44.060,00:17:52.130

rapidly with k.",00:17:52.130,00:17:55.500

is that the rate at which",00:18:28.440,00:18:37.380

steady state is totally",00:19:30.490,00:19:34.790
meaningless.,00:19:34.790,00:19:36.040

this but I can't.",00:20:10.186,00:20:13.860

to get the extra things",00:20:49.450,00:20:53.170

picture again, and we look at",00:22:45.110,00:22:49.850
"it in terms of the sample time
Markov chain, what's going on?",00:22:49.850,00:22:54.210

in other words,",00:22:56.990,00:22:59.050
moving up in time.,00:22:59.050,00:23:01.350
"And I again, urge you if you
have trouble thinking of time",00:23:01.350,00:23:05.600
"running backwards, think of left

"will have no trouble thinking
of things going to the left",00:23:09.640,00:23:12.890
and things going to the right.,00:23:12.890,00:23:16.550
"So moving to the right, which
is the normal way to move",00:23:16.550,00:23:19.830

exit rate is nu sub j.",00:23:19.830,00:23:24.950

time t2, if moving this way",00:23:33.020,00:23:38.970
"you move into state
j, what happens?",00:23:38.970,00:23:42.900
"You leave state j going leftward
in each delta unit",00:23:42.900,00:23:48.930
time with--,00:23:48.930,00:23:50.460
"There's this same rate here,
which is the rate when you",00:23:50.460,00:23:55.030
"look at it either way, is this
rate here at which you leave",00:23:55.030,00:23:58.475
"this state j, which is delta nu
sub j, and all we're using",00:23:58.475,00:24:02.810
"here is the memorylessness of
the exponential distribution.",00:24:02.810,00:24:07.180
"That's the only thing
going on here.",00:24:07.180,00:24:08.890
"So Poisson process is clearly
reversible from the",00:24:18.030,00:24:22.240
"incremental definition, and
that's what we're using here.",00:24:22.240,00:24:26.040
"And that what this means is
that the steady state",00:24:26.040,00:24:29.050
"probabilities, the pi sub i's,
and also, the nu sub i's,",00:24:29.050,00:24:33.960

"same going left as
going right.",00:24:36.960,00:24:40.210
"So this is the same kind of
thing we had before, but I",00:24:40.210,00:24:43.340
"think now, you can see it more
easily because there's a",00:24:43.340,00:24:45.920
"finite amount of time that
you're sticking in state j,",00:24:45.920,00:24:50.010

amount of time.",00:24:50.010,00:24:51.970

you're moving out of state j",00:24:51.970,00:24:56.290
"with this constant rate delta,
delta times nu j.",00:24:56.290,00:25:01.640
"When you're going the other way,
it's the same probability",00:25:01.640,00:25:04.720
"that you're going out, going
backwards in time, over a",00:25:04.720,00:25:11.490
"period delta of delta
times nu sub j.",00:25:11.490,00:25:14.230
It's the same both ways.,00:25:14.230,00:25:15.980
"And I think this is easier
to see than the",00:25:15.980,00:25:18.760
thing we did before.,00:25:18.760,00:25:22.010
"OK, so the probability of having
a right transition from",00:25:22.010,00:25:25.940
"j to k in a little period of
time as p sub j, fraction of",00:25:25.940,00:25:31.210
"time in state j, times
q sub jk transition",00:25:31.210,00:25:35.160
rating k times delta.,00:25:35.160,00:25:37.410
"Similarly, if q star sub kj
is the left going process",00:25:37.410,00:25:43.560
"transition rate, the probability
of having the same",00:25:43.560,00:25:46.760
"transition as pk times
q star sub kj, thus",00:25:46.760,00:25:52.120
we have this equation.,00:25:52.120,00:25:53.370
"And this equation,
turns into this.",00:26:04.100,00:26:08.290
"The rate going backwards is
going from k to j is equal to",00:26:08.290,00:26:13.320
"nu sub k times the rate for
the embedding Markov chain",00:26:13.320,00:26:19.050
going backwards.,00:26:19.050,00:26:20.690
"So we define a Markov process as
being reversible if q sub i",00:26:20.690,00:26:25.290
"j star, if the backward rate is
equal to the forward rate",00:26:25.290,00:26:31.220
for all i and j.,00:26:31.220,00:26:33.420
"And if we assume positive
recurrence and we assume that",00:26:33.420,00:26:36.830
"pi sub i over nu sub i is less
than infinity, which is the",00:26:36.830,00:26:42.850
"stability equation, which says
that the rate of transitions",00:26:42.850,00:26:47.170
"has to be finite, then the
Markov process is reversible,",00:26:47.170,00:26:52.560
"if and only if, the
embedded chain is.",00:26:52.560,00:26:55.060
"OK, so this gives you a nice
easy condition to talk about",00:26:55.060,00:26:57.940
reversibility.,00:26:57.940,00:26:59.540
"You can either show that the
chain is reversible or the",00:26:59.540,00:27:04.020
process is reversible.,00:27:04.020,00:27:05.510
They both work the same way.,00:27:05.510,00:27:08.100
"And if you understand chains
then you can use that to",00:27:08.100,00:27:11.000
understand processes.,00:27:11.000,00:27:12.560
"If you understand processes,
you can use that",00:27:12.560,00:27:14.300
to understand chains.,00:27:14.300,00:27:16.650
"OK, so from that we get
what I like to call",00:27:16.650,00:27:19.490
the guessing theorem.,00:27:19.490,00:27:21.440
"Suppose a Markov process is
irreducible, this means every",00:27:21.440,00:27:25.290
"state communicates with every
other state, it's easy to",00:27:25.290,00:27:28.500
verify irreducibility.,00:27:28.500,00:27:31.000
"It's sometimes hard to verify
whether a chain is positive",00:27:31.000,00:27:36.740
"recurrent or not and whether
the process is positive",00:27:36.740,00:27:39.440
recurrent or not.,00:27:39.440,00:27:40.730
"So this guessing theorem says
if a Markov process is",00:27:40.730,00:27:45.010
"irreducible and if p sub i is
a set of probabilities that",00:27:45.010,00:27:49.170
satisfy this equation here--,00:27:49.170,00:27:51.730
"these are the reversibility
equations--",00:27:51.730,00:27:54.360
"p sub i times qij, rate at which
you're going up is equal",00:27:54.360,00:27:58.840
"to the rate at which you're
going down for all i and j.",00:27:58.840,00:28:02.900
"And when you find that p sub i
that satisfies these equations",00:28:02.900,00:28:09.820
"here, if it also satisfies this
equation, then, in fact,",00:28:09.820,00:28:16.640
you're in business.,00:28:16.640,00:28:18.770
"And what the theorem says is
first, all of these average",00:28:18.770,00:28:26.230
"probabilities are greater than
zero for all i, 2, these",00:28:26.230,00:28:32.570
"average probabilities, this p
sub i, is the sample-path",00:28:32.570,00:28:37.600
"fraction of time in state 1
with probability 1, 3, the",00:28:37.600,00:28:42.320
"process is reversible,
and 4, the embedded",00:28:42.320,00:28:45.530
chain is positive recurrent.,00:28:45.530,00:28:47.290
"You get, all at once--",00:28:47.290,00:28:48.855
"all you've got to
do is find the",00:28:48.855,00:28:50.480
solution to those equations.,00:28:50.480,00:28:52.390
"If you can find the solution
to those equations and it",00:28:52.390,00:28:55.250
"satisfies this, then
you're done.",00:28:55.250,00:28:58.030
"You don't need a birth/death
chain or anything else.",00:28:58.030,00:29:01.440
"All you need to do is guess a
solution to those equations.",00:29:01.440,00:29:05.730
"If you get one, then
that establishes",00:29:05.730,00:29:08.600
everything you need.,00:29:08.600,00:29:10.770
"OK, useful application.",00:29:10.770,00:29:12.730
"All birth/death processes which
satisfy this finite",00:29:12.730,00:29:17.670
"number of transition conditions
are reversible.",00:29:17.670,00:29:21.890
"Remember, we talked about trees",00:29:21.890,00:29:23.620
with the Markov condition.,00:29:23.620,00:29:25.950
"If you have a Markov graph
which is a tree, and it",00:29:25.950,00:29:29.230
"satisfies this condition, then
that process has to be",00:29:29.230,00:29:33.210
reversible.,00:29:33.210,00:29:34.300
"You get it from this theorem
also because, again, you have",00:29:34.300,00:29:38.120
"this condition that what goes
over a branch in a tree, you",00:29:38.120,00:29:43.600
"can only go up on that
branch one more time,",00:29:43.600,00:29:47.020
then you can go down.,00:29:47.020,00:29:48.050
"So you've got the same equality
and the argument is",00:29:48.050,00:29:52.490
exactly the same.,00:29:52.490,00:29:54.950
OK.,00:29:54.950,00:29:55.250
So what do we get out of this?,00:29:55.250,00:29:57.710
"What we get is Burke's
theorem.",00:29:57.710,00:30:00.800
"And what this Burke's
theorem says--",00:30:00.800,00:30:02.440
"Burke's theorem here, for
processes, is what you usually",00:30:05.520,00:30:09.100
think of as Burke's theorem.,00:30:09.100,00:30:10.540
"It was the original statement
of Burke's Theorem before",00:30:10.540,00:30:14.000
"people started to look at
sample time chains.",00:30:14.000,00:30:17.840
"And what it says is, given an
M/M/1 queue in steady-state",00:30:17.840,00:30:23.380
"with arrival rate lambda
less than mu--",00:30:23.380,00:30:26.760
"if you look at that condition,
that's exactly what you need",00:30:26.760,00:30:29.950
"for the stability condition
we've been talking about--",00:30:29.950,00:30:33.550
"the departure process is Poisson
with rate lambda.",00:30:33.550,00:30:38.720
"Now you would think
the process--",00:30:38.720,00:30:41.210
"and when we're thinking about
Markov chains, you all thought",00:30:41.210,00:30:47.210
"when you saw this that the
departure process had rate mu",00:30:47.210,00:30:51.350
"because the server was operating
at rate and mu, who",00:30:51.350,00:30:54.320
"said no, that's not right.",00:30:54.320,00:30:56.240
"Because the service rate is mu
anytime the server is active.",00:30:56.240,00:31:02.250
"But is lambda is less
than mu the server",00:31:02.250,00:31:04.580
is not always active.,00:31:04.580,00:31:05.650
"The server is sometimes idle and
therefore, what comes in",00:31:05.650,00:31:12.240
is the same as what goes out.,00:31:12.240,00:31:15.960
"The only possibility is that
this queue is gradually",00:31:15.960,00:31:19.230
"building up over time, and then
what goes out is less",00:31:19.230,00:31:22.740
than what comes in.,00:31:22.740,00:31:23.680
"But otherwise, what comes
in is what goes out.",00:31:23.680,00:31:27.210
"And the rate at which the server
is working is not mu,",00:31:27.210,00:31:31.150
"that the server is working
a rate lambda.",00:31:31.150,00:31:34.460
"Mainly, the server is working at
rate mu when it has things",00:31:34.460,00:31:38.280
"to do but every time it doesn't
have things to do it",00:31:38.280,00:31:42.530
takes a coffee break.,00:31:42.530,00:31:43.630
It's not doing anything.,00:31:43.630,00:31:45.770
"And at that point, when you
amortized over the time the",00:31:45.770,00:31:50.460
"server is taking coffee breaks
and the time the server is",00:31:50.460,00:31:53.330
"working the rate is lambda
because that's the rate at",00:31:53.330,00:31:58.310
which things are coming in.,00:31:58.310,00:32:00.350
"You can only get one thing
out for each thing in.",00:32:00.350,00:32:03.540
"So either the queue builds up
forever, in which case, what's",00:32:03.540,00:32:07.040
"going out is less than what's
coming in or the queue is not",00:32:07.040,00:32:10.520
"building up and what goes out
is exactly what's coming in.",00:32:10.520,00:32:14.430
"I hope looking at it that way
convinces you that what's",00:32:14.430,00:32:18.790
"coming out here is the same
rate as what's going in.",00:32:18.790,00:32:24.070
"OK, the next thing is that the
state x of t is independent of",00:32:24.070,00:32:31.160
the departures before t.,00:32:31.160,00:32:33.540
"This was the same as the
condition we had when we were",00:32:33.540,00:32:37.730
looking at Markov chains.,00:32:37.730,00:32:40.110
"The state x of t is
independent of the",00:32:40.110,00:32:42.750
departure before t.,00:32:42.750,00:32:43.960
"Whether you look at this thing
forward or backward, the state",00:32:43.960,00:32:48.770
"is just the height of
that graph there.",00:32:48.770,00:32:51.210
"So when you're looking at it
backwards, the state that you",00:32:51.210,00:32:55.690
"go through over the process is
the same as the set of states",00:32:55.690,00:33:00.080
"when you're looking at
it the other way.",00:33:00.080,00:33:02.475
"It's just that you have
to flip it around.",00:33:02.475,00:33:05.660
"And it says that the state
is independent of",00:33:05.660,00:33:08.120
departures before t.,00:33:08.120,00:33:09.760
"The reason for that is that when
you look at the backward",00:33:09.760,00:33:13.230
"process, every departure here
is an arrival here.",00:33:13.230,00:33:18.610
These arrivals here--,00:33:18.610,00:33:20.280
"This is an arrival, this
is an arrival,",00:33:20.280,00:33:22.480
this is a third arrival.,00:33:22.480,00:33:24.195
"This is the fourth arrival
and those depart later.",00:33:24.195,00:33:28.300
"When you're looking at it that
way, what's going on?",00:33:28.300,00:33:32.250
"These things that are called
departures up in the top graph",00:33:32.250,00:33:35.740
"are called arrivals when you're
looking at it going",00:33:35.740,00:33:38.500
this way like.,00:33:38.500,00:33:39.360
"What this is saying is-- when
you're looking at this as an",00:33:39.360,00:33:45.390
"M/M/1 process, what it's saying
is for the backward",00:33:45.390,00:33:51.200
"M/M/1 process, the arrivals that
come in later than me do",00:33:51.200,00:33:56.130
not affect my service time.,00:33:56.130,00:33:58.810
"This is because we have first
come first serve service, and",00:33:58.810,00:34:02.750
"if somebody with an
enormous service",00:34:02.750,00:34:04.670
requirement comes after me--,00:34:04.670,00:34:09.920
"If I'm at the supermarket and
somebody comes in with three",00:34:09.920,00:34:12.719
"big barrels of food, I breath
a sigh of relief because I'm",00:34:12.719,00:34:17.469
there first.,00:34:17.469,00:34:18.420
"And I get out quickly,
and I don't have to",00:34:18.420,00:34:20.050
wait for this person.,00:34:20.050,00:34:21.480
"And that's essentially,
what this is saying.",00:34:21.480,00:34:24.520
"OK, the third one for first come
first serve service, a",00:34:24.520,00:34:27.850
"customer's arrival time, given
that it departs at time t, is",00:34:27.850,00:34:33.520
"independent of the departures
before time t.",00:34:33.520,00:34:36.429
"That's almost the same
as two, but it's not",00:34:36.429,00:34:39.070
quite the same as two.,00:34:39.070,00:34:40.179
"It only applies if
you have first",00:34:40.179,00:34:42.639
come first serve service.,00:34:42.639,00:34:45.460
"This is not quite true
for Markov chains.",00:34:45.460,00:34:48.929
"You remember when we
stated Burke's",00:34:48.929,00:34:50.690
theorem for Markov chains.,00:34:50.690,00:34:52.429
"We only had these first two
statements, and now we have",00:34:52.429,00:34:55.790
this third statement.,00:34:55.790,00:34:57.150
"Let me try to explain in the
next slide why that's true.",00:34:57.150,00:35:01.060
"If I can explain this to you and
make you believe it on the",00:35:07.130,00:35:10.590
"first time I feel very
proud of myself.",00:35:10.590,00:35:13.370
"Because this is the kind of
thing you have to have",00:35:13.370,00:35:16.940
explained to you three times.,00:35:16.940,00:35:18.710
"You have to sit down
and think about it.",00:35:18.710,00:35:20.780
"The first three times you
think about it, you say,",00:35:20.780,00:35:23.400

"The fourth time you
think about it,",00:35:24.880,00:35:26.720
"you say, that's false.",00:35:26.720,00:35:29.340
"And maybe the fifth time you
say, it's false again.",00:35:29.340,00:35:31.860
"And the sixth time you look at
it just the right way, and it",00:35:31.860,00:35:35.410
turns out to be true.,00:35:35.410,00:35:37.700
"And then you go back a week
later, and it's false again.",00:35:37.700,00:35:41.510
"But anyway, let me try.",00:35:41.510,00:35:44.810

at the right moving",00:35:44.810,00:35:47.220

an arrival [? in ?] the",00:35:49.410,00:35:58.390

service, looking at",00:36:06.320,00:36:09.190
the left moving process--,00:36:09.190,00:36:11.740
"that's the left moving
process--",00:36:11.740,00:36:13.850
"the departure time of an
arrival at time t--",00:36:13.850,00:36:18.340
here's an arrival at time t--,00:36:18.340,00:36:20.730

in this case, is that",00:36:20.730,00:36:24.940
departure right there.,00:36:24.940,00:36:28.900

the arrivals and the service",00:36:28.900,00:36:33.930

is what happens first.",00:36:38.640,00:36:41.980

nothing to do--",00:36:46.360,00:36:49.870
"Well, this arrival here, in
general, does have something",00:36:49.870,00:36:52.830
"to do with this arrival, because
if this arrival were",00:36:52.830,00:36:55.810
"not finished by this time, we
would have to wait for it.",00:36:55.810,00:37:01.390
"The waiting time of this arrival
here depends on what",00:37:01.390,00:37:05.070
"happened before, which
is over here.",00:37:05.070,00:37:07.370
"It does not depend on the
arrivals after it because it's",00:37:07.370,00:37:10.920
"first come first
serve service.",00:37:10.920,00:37:13.280
"And therefore, anything
that comes after is",00:37:13.280,00:37:15.770
sitting behind us.,00:37:15.770,00:37:17.150
It doesn't bother us at all.,00:37:17.150,00:37:20.120
"OK, for the corresponding right
moving process then",00:37:20.120,00:37:24.350
"coming back the other way, the
arrival time of that departure",00:37:24.350,00:37:28.860
"is independent as the departures
before t, and",00:37:28.860,00:37:32.370
"that's exactly what this
theorem is saying.",00:37:32.370,00:37:35.660
"In order to make sense of this
you have to do something that",00:37:35.660,00:37:38.210
we've been doing all along.,00:37:38.210,00:37:40.800
"We don't always talk about is
very much, but I hope you're",00:37:40.800,00:37:45.490
getting used to doing it.,00:37:45.490,00:37:47.220
You talk about sample paths.,00:37:47.220,00:37:49.380
"When you're talking about sample
paths, you're talking",00:37:49.380,00:37:52.030
"about one particular
instantiation of the process.",00:37:52.030,00:37:56.360
"You prove a result for that
sample path, then you say,",00:37:56.360,00:38:00.800
"that's true for all
sample paths.",00:38:00.800,00:38:03.160
"And then, you say, a ha, then it
must be true for the random",00:38:03.160,00:38:05.680
"variables of which these sample
paths are sample cases.",00:38:05.680,00:38:11.890
"That's an argument we go
through so many times.",00:38:11.890,00:38:15.030
"In fact, when you take
probability the first time,",00:38:15.030,00:38:17.710
"pretty soon it becomes second
nature to you, and",00:38:17.710,00:38:20.650
every once in while--,00:38:20.650,00:38:22.280
"In fact it becomes so much
second nature, that most",00:38:22.280,00:38:25.250
"people don't even distinguish
between random variables and",00:38:25.250,00:38:31.930
actual sample path numbers.,00:38:31.930,00:38:34.750
"They use the same symbol
for both of them.",00:38:34.750,00:38:37.440
"Every once in a while I get
confused by this, but",00:38:37.440,00:38:40.150
"eventually, they get it
straightened out, and that's",00:38:40.150,00:38:43.360
"part of what this argument
is here.",00:38:43.360,00:38:47.120
"OK, let's test our understanding
now.",00:38:47.120,00:38:52.140
"Let's look at tandem
M/M/1 queues.",00:38:52.140,00:38:56.650
"First, we don't quite know what
that means, but let's",00:38:56.650,00:39:00.630
"consider two queues, one sitting
right after the other.",00:39:00.630,00:39:06.050
"Departures from the first queue
move directly into the",00:39:06.050,00:39:10.050
second queue.,00:39:10.050,00:39:11.600
"The partition here moved
directly into here.",00:39:11.600,00:39:14.700
"I've shown these departures at
rate lambda because what",00:39:14.700,00:39:19.940
"Burke's theorem says, is that
these departures are, in fact,",00:39:19.940,00:39:24.230
"a Poisson process,
we rate lambda.",00:39:24.230,00:39:27.060
"You think you're through at this
point, but you're not.",00:39:27.060,00:39:29.410
"You still have some difficult
thinking to go through.",00:39:29.410,00:39:33.570
"So you're assuming originally,
that the input is Poisson.",00:39:33.570,00:39:38.990
"You're assuming that the first
queue has exponential",00:39:38.990,00:39:42.800
"services, the service times are
independent of each other,",00:39:42.800,00:39:47.870
"they're all iid, and they're
independent of the",00:39:47.870,00:39:51.080
inter-arrival times.,00:39:51.080,00:39:52.460
"So this first thing here is
just an M/M/1 queue like",00:39:52.460,00:39:55.510
you're used to.,00:39:55.510,00:39:56.830
"We now know that what's coming
out of that first queue is a",00:39:56.830,00:40:00.270
Poisson process.,00:40:00.270,00:40:02.640
"It's a little hard to
look at as a Poisson",00:40:02.640,00:40:04.740
process but it is.,00:40:04.740,00:40:05.970
"It is not a Poisson process if
you're conditioning on what's",00:40:05.970,00:40:11.520
going on in the first queue.,00:40:11.520,00:40:13.300
"It's not a Poisson process
conditional on these arrival",00:40:13.300,00:40:17.220
"times here or on these
service times here.",00:40:17.220,00:40:20.070
"It's only a Poisson process if
we're looking at the departure",00:40:20.070,00:40:28.680
"times unconditional
on anything else.",00:40:28.680,00:40:33.920
"Conditional only on the other
departure times or iid, That's",00:40:33.920,00:40:38.420
what we've proven.,00:40:38.420,00:40:40.640
"But conditional on what's going
on in the first queues",00:40:40.640,00:40:43.210
"of those departures, are
sure as hell not even",00:40:43.210,00:40:46.860
close to doing iid.,00:40:46.860,00:40:49.770
"I mean, if you've got a lot of
arrivals and you've got a lot",00:40:49.770,00:40:52.700
"of long service times, the queue
is going to get busy.",00:40:52.700,00:40:56.290
"And what's coming out of that
queue is going to be at rate",00:40:56.290,00:40:59.640
"mu, which is what all of you
believe until you see this",00:40:59.640,00:41:02.460
"theorem, and think it through.",00:41:02.460,00:41:05.340
"And that's why you believe it,
because you look normally, at",00:41:05.340,00:41:11.700
"time moving from
left to right.",00:41:11.700,00:41:13.385
"We're going to assume the
service time at rates mu 1 and",00:41:16.680,00:41:19.830
"mu 2 are independent from
queue to queue.",00:41:19.830,00:41:24.100
And they're independent--,00:41:24.100,00:41:26.360
"Ah, I didn't change that.",00:41:26.360,00:41:29.440
This doesn't make any sense.,00:41:29.440,00:41:31.730
"The service rates at mu1 and mu2
are independent from this",00:41:31.730,00:41:37.460
"queue to this queue, and they're
independent of the",00:41:37.460,00:41:40.140
"inter-arrival times
back there.",00:41:40.140,00:41:44.230
"Now, why do I have
to change that?",00:41:44.230,00:41:45.920
"Why can't I say that the service
times at mu1 and mu2",00:41:45.920,00:41:51.490
"are independent of both the
arrivals to the first queue",00:41:51.490,00:41:56.130
"and the arrivals to
the second queue?",00:41:56.130,00:41:58.200
"Because first, I can't assume
things that are not given by",00:41:58.200,00:42:04.680
the model of the problem.,00:42:04.680,00:42:07.230
"The things going from queue 1
into queue 2, I know they're",00:42:07.230,00:42:11.690
"Poisson now, but I don't know
that they're Poisson",00:42:11.690,00:42:15.070
"independent of what's going
into the first queue, and",00:42:15.070,00:42:18.920
"independent of the service times
in the first queue, and",00:42:18.920,00:42:21.210
they certainly aren't.,00:42:21.210,00:42:22.790
"So what I have to say here is
they're independent from queue",00:42:22.790,00:42:26.100
"to queue and independent
of the arrivals",00:42:26.100,00:42:29.940
at the first queue.,00:42:29.940,00:42:31.190
"OK, we know that the arrivals
at queue 2 are",00:42:34.690,00:42:37.390
Poisson at rate lambda.,00:42:37.390,00:42:39.660
"That's true by Burke's
theorem.",00:42:39.660,00:42:42.730
"And they're independent of
the service times at 2.",00:42:42.730,00:42:47.140
"That alone makes the
second queue M/M/1.",00:42:47.140,00:42:51.320
"Because the second queue
has arrivals.",00:42:51.320,00:42:54.040
It has service times.,00:42:54.040,00:42:55.240
"The arrivals are independent
of the service times.",00:42:55.240,00:42:57.940
"It is, by definition, what
an M/M/1 queue is.",00:42:57.940,00:43:01.780
"It might depend on what's going
on in the first queue to",00:43:01.780,00:43:05.290
a certain extent.,00:43:05.290,00:43:06.200
"Burke's theorem tells us, in one
sense, it doesn't depend",00:43:06.200,00:43:09.330
"on it, and that's the next thing
we have to deal with.",00:43:09.330,00:43:13.330
"The states of the two systems
are independent and the time",00:43:13.330,00:43:17.320
"of a customer in system
one is independent of",00:43:17.320,00:43:20.380
that in state two.,00:43:20.380,00:43:22.090
"I'm not going to try to convince
you of that here.",00:43:22.090,00:43:24.950
"The text does, I think, do
a pretty good job of",00:43:24.950,00:43:29.050
convincing you of it.,00:43:29.050,00:43:31.050
"It's a more complicated
argument than this.",00:43:31.050,00:43:34.170
"And s something which you just
have to either say, I believe",00:43:34.170,00:43:38.270
"it because I'm too tired
to do anything else.",00:43:38.270,00:43:42.050
"Or you have to go through it
several times, sometimes",00:43:42.050,00:43:47.240
"disbelieving and sometimes
believing until finally,",00:43:47.240,00:43:50.200
"saying, I guess it
must be true.",00:43:50.200,00:43:52.320
"OK, so enough of that.",00:43:52.320,00:43:56.940
"Let's go on to random walks,
which is where we should have",00:43:56.940,00:44:00.640
been 45 minutes ago.,00:44:00.640,00:44:04.170
"You see our problem here is
that we would like to talk",00:44:04.170,00:44:07.980
"about martingales a little bit
in this course because",00:44:07.980,00:44:11.150
"martingales are extremely
important things.",00:44:11.150,00:44:15.270
"You can prove all sorts
of things from them.",00:44:15.270,00:44:18.700
"An enormous amount of modern
research in the field uses",00:44:18.700,00:44:22.260
"martingales, and you can do a
great deal with martingales",00:44:22.260,00:44:27.300
"without knowing anything
about measure theory.",00:44:27.300,00:44:30.580
"And almost all the books that
talk about martingales use",00:44:30.580,00:44:34.320
"measure theory, and therefore,
require you to take a couple",00:44:34.320,00:44:37.520
"of extra terms of math courses
before you can understand",00:44:37.520,00:44:40.940
what's going on.,00:44:40.940,00:44:42.050
"So it's important to be able to
say something about them,",00:44:42.050,00:44:45.140
"in this course, so
you have enough--",00:44:45.140,00:44:47.850
"so you know when you
have to learn more",00:44:47.850,00:44:49.950
about them at least.,00:44:49.950,00:44:51.640
"So I want to get to that point,
which is why I've been",00:44:51.640,00:44:57.790
"speeding up a little bit from
what I would like to do.",00:44:57.790,00:45:00.370
"If you noticed, if you've been
reading the notes, I have",00:45:00.370,00:45:03.815

Markov processes that all the",00:45:16.910,00:45:21.260
"business with eigenvalues
we went through",00:45:21.260,00:45:23.790

have time to do it.",00:45:26.620,00:45:29.470
"And the other trouble is all the
time that we would spend",00:45:29.470,00:45:32.760

time understanding linear",00:45:32.760,00:45:37.460
"systems of differential
equations.",00:45:37.460,00:45:41.550

and you have a good feel for",00:45:41.550,00:45:45.375
"it, fine, you can read the
section and notes.",00:45:45.375,00:45:48.750
"If you're not familiar with
that, then you have to learn",00:45:48.750,00:45:51.780
something about it.,00:45:51.780,00:45:52.980

"not something we will use at any
other time in this course.",00:45:56.690,00:46:01.370

onto random walks.",00:46:01.370,00:46:04.800

very simple kind of animal.",00:46:04.800,00:46:08.360

about sound like very",00:52:47.830,00:52:50.150

you think about it for a",00:52:50.150,00:52:52.990
"minute, all of these renewal
processes we've spent all this",00:52:52.990,00:52:57.730

with, are just a special case",00:52:57.730,00:53:00.800
of random walks.,00:53:00.800,00:53:02.500

non-negative random variables.",00:53:02.500,00:53:08.520

non-negative random variables",00:53:08.520,00:53:10.960
to see what's going on.,00:53:10.960,00:53:12.340

dealing with sums of iid",00:53:12.340,00:53:17.560

very nice either.",00:57:46.540,00:57:49.300

way to write it.",00:58:28.440,00:58:32.400

No.,00:58:39.160,00:58:39.880

we get this formula here?",00:59:06.950,00:59:11.210

1 at some point.",00:59:33.810,00:59:38.290

or down by one at a time.",00:59:38.290,00:59:41.690

hit 1 at some point.",00:59:41.690,00:59:44.540
"Given that you've hit 1, you
have to go on and hit 2 at",00:59:44.540,00:59:47.880
some point.,00:59:47.880,00:59:49.490
"Given that you've hit 2, you
have to move up and hit 3 at",00:59:49.490,00:59:52.470
some point.,00:59:52.470,00:59:53.320
"Those events are independent
of each other.",00:59:53.320,00:59:56.170
"So the probability that you
ever get to k is the",00:59:56.170,01:00:00.030
"probability that you can
stop when you're ahead.",01:00:00.030,01:00:02.800
"Namely, it's the probability
that you go from 0 to 1 up to",01:00:02.800,01:00:07.540
the k-th power.,01:00:07.540,01:00:09.080
"So I'm saying that p over 1
minus p is the probability you",01:00:09.080,01:00:13.550
"ever move from state
0 up to state 1.",01:00:13.550,01:00:18.780
"And when we were looking at Stop
When You're Ahead, it was",01:00:18.780,01:00:22.060
exactly this game here.,01:00:22.060,01:00:24.220
"We moved up with probability
p, down with probability q.",01:00:24.220,01:00:27.990
"We were looking at the
probability we'd ever be ahead",01:00:27.990,01:00:31.220
"in this gambling game where we
kept betting money, and we",01:00:31.220,01:00:35.690
"always had an infinite
capital.",01:00:35.690,01:00:37.140
"So we could keep on
betting forever.",01:00:37.140,01:00:39.890
"And we stopped as soon
as we hit 1.",01:00:39.890,01:00:41.990
"So it's exactly this
question here.",01:00:41.990,01:00:44.800
"The way we solved it at that
point was to write an",01:00:44.800,01:00:48.230
equation for it.,01:00:48.230,01:00:50.700
"On the first step, you either
move up, and you're there.",01:00:50.700,01:00:56.860
Or you move down.,01:00:56.860,01:00:59.650
"And if you move down, you
have to move up twice.",01:00:59.650,01:01:03.540
"So the probability you ever
get from here to here is p",01:01:03.540,01:01:07.830
"plus q times the probability
you get from here squared.",01:01:07.830,01:01:13.190
"You solve that quadratic
equation.",01:01:13.190,01:01:15.450
"You might remember solving
that before.",01:01:15.450,01:01:17.910
"And that's where you get
to p over 1 minus p.",01:01:17.910,01:01:21.060
"OK, so that's not terribly
important.",01:01:21.060,01:01:23.920
"What is important is that this
is the only problem in random",01:01:23.920,01:01:27.770
"walks I know which has
a trivial solution.",01:01:27.770,01:01:31.670
"Most problems have a harder
solution than that.",01:01:31.670,01:01:34.200
"But there is at least one
problem which is easy.",01:01:34.200,01:01:39.700
"Now for those of you worried
about a final exam, final",01:01:39.700,01:01:43.280
"exams have to find problems
which are easy.",01:01:43.280,01:01:46.340
So that tells you something.,01:01:46.340,01:01:51.450
"I mean, we have to take the easy
results in this course,",01:01:51.450,01:01:53.840
"and we have to use
them in someway.",01:01:53.840,01:01:56.020
"And since I'm telling
you that, I probably",01:01:56.020,01:01:57.640
"will include it, so--",01:01:57.640,01:02:00.145
OK.,01:02:00.145,01:02:01.510
Integer random walks.,01:02:01.510,01:02:02.920
"That's the next kind of random
walk to talk about.",01:02:02.920,01:02:04.835
"x is an integer random
variable.",01:02:07.880,01:02:10.400
"So similarly, s sub n is an
integer random variable.",01:02:10.400,01:02:15.300
"So when we're moving up, we
move up in integer values,",01:02:15.300,01:02:18.400
"which makes things a
little bit easier.",01:02:18.400,01:02:20.680
"This means, again, that we can
model this as a Markov chain.",01:02:20.680,01:02:25.200
"In the Markov chain, we start
at 0, we move up whatever",01:02:25.200,01:02:29.740
"number of values x sub n can
have, or we move down whatever",01:02:29.740,01:02:33.450
number of values it can have.,01:02:33.450,01:02:35.160
"And then from there, we
keep moving again.",01:02:35.160,01:02:37.770
"So it's this Markov chain with
a very regular structure,",01:02:37.770,01:02:42.900
"where for each state, the set
of various states of up",01:02:42.900,01:02:46.520
"transition and set of down
transitions are all the same",01:02:46.520,01:02:50.990
for all the states.,01:02:50.990,01:02:52.030
"So that's a simple Markov
chain to deal with.",01:02:52.030,01:02:56.730
"OK, and then we said that
renewal processes are special",01:02:56.730,01:03:00.020
"cases of random walks where x is
a positive random variable.",01:03:00.020,01:03:06.020
"When you're sketching sample
paths, the axes are usually",01:03:06.020,01:03:08.940
"reversed from random processes
to random walks.",01:03:08.940,01:03:13.600
"I'm just pointing this out
because every time you try to",01:03:13.600,01:03:16.890
"go from a random walk to a
two-way renewal process, you",01:03:16.890,01:03:25.670
"will be happily writing
equations and drawing pictures",01:03:25.670,01:03:30.620
of what you're doing.,01:03:30.620,01:03:32.670
"And you will suddenly come up
against this problem, which is",01:03:32.670,01:03:37.300
"that whenever you draw a figure
for a renewal process,",01:03:37.300,01:03:42.810
you draw it this way.,01:03:42.810,01:03:44.792
OK?,01:03:44.792,01:03:45.290
"In other words, what you're
looking at is the time at",01:03:45.290,01:03:48.050
which the n-th arrival occurs.,01:03:48.050,01:03:49.780

arrival occurs is S1.",01:03:51.570,01:03:54.840

and so forth--",01:04:00.880,01:04:06.950

"interested in directly
these s's and x's.",01:04:09.070,01:04:15.140
"And you always draw it
the opposite way",01:04:15.140,01:04:16.940
with the axes reversed.,01:04:16.940,01:04:19.580
"And what's confusing to you at
first is that when you see",01:04:19.580,01:04:23.650
"this picture, it doesn't look
like this picture at all.",01:04:23.650,01:04:27.550
"These two pictures
are identical",01:04:27.550,01:04:29.530
with the axes reversed.,01:04:29.530,01:04:32.030
"One is the way you draw
renewal processes.",01:04:32.030,01:04:35.930
"The other is the way you
draw random walks--",01:04:35.930,01:04:39.880
"which also suggests that
sometimes when you're dealing",01:04:39.880,01:04:42.590
"with random walks, you want
to draw a picture like the",01:04:42.590,01:04:46.250
"picture you draw for renewal
processes and vice versa.",01:04:46.250,01:04:50.150
"So the two are very
closely related.",01:04:50.150,01:04:53.670
"OK, so I want to do a little bit
about the queuing delay in",01:04:53.670,01:05:00.235
a G/G/1 queue.,01:05:00.235,01:05:02.010

"of Little's Theorem and
various other things.",01:05:05.190,01:05:09.640

thing about G/G/1 queues that",01:05:09.640,01:05:13.470
"follows from looking
at random walks.",01:05:13.470,01:05:17.290

problem you can solve dealing",01:05:17.290,01:05:20.220
with random walks.,01:05:20.220,01:05:22.940

to draw the obvious",01:06:16.850,01:06:19.520
conclusion from it.,01:06:19.520,01:06:20.770
"If you try to talk about what
is the waiting time in queue",01:06:23.670,01:06:30.420

we draw that in a figure?",01:06:30.420,01:06:34.670
"Well here it is in
this figure.",01:06:34.670,01:06:37.150
"The 0-th customer has no waiting
time at all, because",01:06:40.490,01:06:43.470
there's nothing in the queue.,01:06:43.470,01:06:45.290
"It goes directly into
the server.",01:06:45.290,01:06:47.440
I'm just talking about queueing,01:06:47.440,01:06:48.700
"time, not system time.",01:06:48.700,01:06:50.690
"So 0 goes directly into the
server, takes some long",01:06:50.690,01:06:55.050
"service time, ends here.",01:06:55.050,01:06:58.080
"The next arrival occurs at
this time here after this",01:06:58.080,01:07:03.440
inter-arrival time.,01:07:03.440,01:07:05.650
And what's it have to do?,01:07:05.650,01:07:07.090
"It has to wait until this
customer finishes.",01:07:07.090,01:07:11.590
"And then it has to wait for its
own service time before it",01:07:11.590,01:07:14.650
gets out of the system.,01:07:14.650,01:07:16.720
"The next customer comes in x2
units of time after the first",01:07:16.720,01:07:23.990
customer comes in.,01:07:23.990,01:07:25.690
So it comes in here.,01:07:25.690,01:07:27.250
"It has to wait in queue until
after the first customer gets",01:07:27.250,01:07:31.020
"finished, and so forth.",01:07:31.020,01:07:32.580

"until the second customer
goes into service.",01:07:40.410,01:07:45.090

"It can be written in
two different ways.",01:07:46.190,01:07:48.040

that makes it possible to",01:07:48.040,01:07:52.090
analyze G/G/1 queues.,01:07:52.090,01:07:55.010

so you can spot it.",01:08:17.700,01:08:20.350

is queued, then xn plus wn,",01:08:20.350,01:08:28.020

n-th customer plus its waiting",01:08:28.020,01:08:31.220

queue, then wn equals 0.",01:08:40.380,01:08:45.514
OK?,01:08:45.514,01:08:46.939
This is easy.,01:08:46.939,01:08:49.960
"If you didn't draw
this picture, it",01:08:49.960,01:08:51.269
would be very hard.,01:08:51.269,01:08:52.630
"If you tried to do this
by algebra, you",01:08:52.630,01:08:55.870
would never get done.,01:08:55.870,01:08:57.000
"But when you draw a picture,
there's nothing to it.",01:08:57.000,01:09:00.910
"OK, so that says w sub n is
equal to y sub n minus 1 minus",01:09:00.910,01:09:08.220
"xn plus w sub n minus 1 if w sub
n minus 1 plus yn minus 1",01:09:08.220,01:09:15.939
"is greater than or equal
to xn, namely, if xn",01:09:15.939,01:09:18.529
gets queued at all.,01:09:18.529,01:09:20.279
"And otherwise, w sub
n is equal to 0.",01:09:20.279,01:09:22.740
"In other words, if the n-th
customer enters a queue which",01:09:22.740,01:09:25.670
"is empty, it doesn't wait
in queue at all.",01:09:25.670,01:09:30.529
"It goes right into service if
that condition is satisfied.",01:09:30.529,01:09:34.050

plus yn minus 1 minus xn or 0.",01:09:38.729,01:09:48.950

the amount of time that",01:09:48.950,01:09:52.229
"each customer has to wait in the
queue, not in the system--",01:09:52.229,01:09:55.780

either this quantity here",01:09:55.780,01:10:00.570

time of the previous customer",01:10:00.570,01:10:05.100

the customer before.",01:10:07.960,01:10:12.240

n minus 1 minus plus xn--",01:10:12.240,01:10:21.360
y sub n minus 1 minus xn--,01:10:21.360,01:10:23.610

the n minus first customer",01:10:23.610,01:10:27.180

the n-th customer, this is",01:10:27.180,01:10:32.220
independent over n.,01:10:32.220,01:10:34.930
"So this is a IID random
variable.",01:10:34.930,01:10:38.180

independent of each other.",01:10:45.560,01:10:49.220

is that w sub n is equal to",01:10:55.840,01:10:59.750

"It keeps going up for a while
you have a queue.",01:12:17.860,01:12:21.060
Then it might start dropping.,01:12:21.060,01:12:24.220

gets down below 0, the next",01:12:26.090,01:12:31.390

negative, you get",01:12:34.960,01:12:36.980
bumped up to 0 again.,01:12:36.980,01:12:39.590
"It's like a naughty kid who
goes through all sorts of",01:12:39.590,01:12:45.630

negative, somebody picks",01:12:45.630,01:12:48.900
"him up and starts him
back up again.",01:12:48.900,01:12:51.910

"well, it's a different
kind of process.",01:12:54.740,01:12:56.730

up, and you start over again.",01:13:04.650,01:13:07.910

"If you study radar or any kind
of military problem, detection",01:13:51.160,01:13:58.410
is very important.,01:13:58.410,01:13:59.300

something has happened or not.",01:13:59.300,01:14:02.620

"presence of a great deal
of noise or something.",01:14:05.500,01:14:08.190
"So you're not sure of whether
it's happened or not.",01:14:08.190,01:14:10.710
"So you make many observations to
see whether it's happened.",01:14:10.710,01:14:14.750
"And then you try to make a
decision on the basis of all",01:14:14.750,01:14:18.390
of those things.,01:14:18.390,01:14:19.900
Decisions--,01:14:19.900,01:14:21.690

themselves.",01:14:29.330,01:14:32.420

studying random",01:14:32.420,01:14:35.320
processes is all about.,01:14:35.320,01:14:37.400
"How do you make sensible
decisions?",01:14:37.400,01:14:40.650
You generally--,01:14:40.650,01:14:41.490
"when you make a decision, you
make it with some uncertainty",01:14:41.490,01:14:44.880
connected to it.,01:14:44.880,01:14:46.570
"I mean, people respond to this
by pretending there isn't any",01:14:46.570,01:14:49.640
uncertainty.,01:14:49.640,01:14:50.870
"They pretend when they
made a decision that",01:14:50.870,01:14:53.190
they must be right.,01:14:53.190,01:14:54.530
"But actually, they
could be wrong.",01:14:54.530,01:14:57.670
"And sensible people face the
fact that they might be wrong.",01:14:57.670,01:15:01.400

analyze what's the probability",01:15:01.400,01:15:04.830

probability of being right,",01:15:04.830,01:15:07.520

Hypothesis testing--,01:15:08.780,01:15:10.740
all scientists deal with this.,01:15:10.740,01:15:12.650

in some field, and in these",01:15:12.650,01:15:16.930

find out which is the right",01:15:16.930,01:15:20.660
hypothesis.,01:15:20.660,01:15:21.990
So you do a lot of tests.,01:15:21.990,01:15:24.190
"And after all those tests, you
try to decide which hypothesis",01:15:24.190,01:15:28.660
you believe in.,01:15:28.660,01:15:30.510
"Why is it important
to make a choice?",01:15:30.510,01:15:34.140

choice in all sorts of reasons",01:15:34.140,01:15:37.630

"Even in a scientific
area, I mean-- the",01:15:41.040,01:15:44.290
field has to move somehow.,01:15:44.290,01:15:46.740

of open questions and if",01:15:46.740,01:15:50.480

might be quantum theory, or",01:15:50.480,01:15:53.850
"there might not be
quantum theory.",01:15:53.850,01:15:56.000
It might all be wrong.,01:15:56.000,01:15:57.410
It might all be right.,01:15:57.410,01:15:58.660
I don't know.,01:15:58.660,01:16:01.070
"I mean there's noise
in the system,",01:16:01.070,01:16:02.830
we can't tell anything.,01:16:02.830,01:16:04.390
"So all they're dealing with is
a set of very complicated",01:16:04.390,01:16:07.360
probabilities.,01:16:07.360,01:16:08.440
"Instead of that, people
do make decisions.",01:16:08.440,01:16:11.530

basis of what they think is",01:16:11.530,01:16:15.820

one or the other.",01:16:28.520,01:16:30.530

everywhere.",01:16:33.500,01:16:38.300

are you left with?",01:16:41.090,01:16:44.460

establishing probabilities,",01:16:48.390,01:16:50.790

rubber hits the road, when you",01:16:52.650,01:16:56.010
"study decision making or
hypothesis testing or",01:16:56.010,01:16:59.740
"detection, whichever one
you want to call it.",01:16:59.740,01:17:02.190

these hypothesis tests at",01:17:02.190,01:17:06.790
some point.,01:17:06.790,01:17:07.550

hypothesis tests because the",01:17:07.550,01:17:11.020

be easier to live with than",01:17:11.020,01:17:17.420
the language in other places.,01:17:17.420,01:17:20.070
"Not that I like the way the
statisticians do these things.",01:17:20.070,01:17:23.750

errors of the second kind.,01:17:27.170,01:17:28.990

second kind?",01:17:34.980,01:17:38.180

names to these things.",01:17:38.180,01:17:41.940

about that.",01:17:45.760,01:17:49.850

consider only problems",01:17:49.850,01:17:53.990
"where you have two possible

h in it.",01:18:05.910,01:18:08.860

two possible values, 0 or 1.",01:18:08.860,01:18:14.460

multiple observations that",01:18:14.460,01:18:18.800

Y3, Y4, up to y sub n, say.",01:18:18.800,01:18:24.190

have to take a guess.,01:19:08.040,01:19:10.300

of everything involved.,01:22:27.380,01:22:28.680
"We have a complete probabilistic
model.",01:22:28.680,01:22:31.230
"We will talk about-- in this
probabilistic model, when you",01:22:31.230,01:22:35.080
"get a certain observation,
what's the probability the one",01:22:35.080,01:22:37.890
hypothesis is correct?,01:22:37.890,01:22:39.020
"What's the probability the other
hypothesis is correct?",01:22:39.020,01:22:42.810
"People suddenly lost everything
they'd learned",01:22:42.810,01:22:46.240
"about probability, and said
this can't be right.",01:22:46.240,01:22:50.690
"So there were enormous
fights about it.",01:22:50.690,01:22:52.790
"Anyway, I wanted to
get to that point.",01:22:52.790,01:22:54.840
Think about that.,01:22:54.840,01:22:56.290
"Next time we're going to
start out and do a",01:22:56.290,01:22:59.260
little bit with this.,01:22:59.260,01:23:00.860
"And suddenly a random walk
is going to emerge.",01:23:00.860,01:23:03.360
So we will do that next time.,01:23:03.360,01:23:05.210
