"Today, and for the next two
weeks, we are going to be",00:00:08.000,00:00:11.754
"studying what,
for many engineers and a few",00:00:11.754,00:00:14.787
"scientists is the most popular
method of solving any",00:00:14.787,00:00:18.469
"differential equation of the
kind that they happen to be,",00:00:18.469,00:00:22.512
"and that is to use the popular
machine called the Laplace",00:00:22.512,00:00:26.555
"transform.
Now, you will get proficient in",00:00:26.555,00:00:30.030
"using it by the end of the two
weeks.",00:00:30.030,00:00:32.389
"But, there is always a certain
amount of mystery that hangs",00:00:32.389,00:00:36.188
"around it.
People scratch their heads and",00:00:36.188,00:00:38.809
"can't figure out where it comes
from.",00:00:38.809,00:00:41.167
"And, that bothers them a lot.
In the past,",00:00:41.167,00:00:43.853
"I've usually promised to tell
you, the students at the end of",00:00:43.853,00:00:47.784
"the two weeks,
but I almost never have time.",00:00:47.784,00:00:50.601
"So, I'm going to break that
glorious tradition and tell you",00:00:50.601,00:00:54.400
"up front at the beginning,
where it comes from,",00:00:54.400,00:00:57.414
"and then talk very fast for the
rest of the period.",00:00:57.414,00:01:02.000
"Okay, a good way of thinking of
where the Laplace transform",00:01:02.000,00:01:06.398
"comes from, and a way which I
think dispels some of its",00:01:06.398,00:01:10.492
"mystery is by thinking of power
series.",00:01:10.492,00:01:13.374
"I think virtually all of you
have studied power series except",00:01:13.374,00:01:17.924
"possibly a few students who just
had 18.01 here last semester,",00:01:17.924,00:01:22.549
"and probably shouldn't be
taking 18.03 anyway,",00:01:22.549,00:01:25.962
"now.
But anyway, a power series",00:01:25.962,00:01:28.236
"looks like this:
summation (a)n x to the n.",00:01:28.236,00:01:31.345
"And, you sum that from,",00:01:31.345,00:01:35.818
"let's say, zero to infinity.
And, the typical thing you want",00:01:35.818,00:01:40.484
"to do with it is add it up to
find out what its sum is.",00:01:40.484,00:01:44.755
"Now, the only way I will depart
from tradition,",00:01:44.755,00:01:48.392
"instead of calling the sum some
generic name like f of x,",00:01:48.392,00:01:52.742
"in order to identify
the sum with the coefficients,",00:01:52.742,00:01:57.487
"a, I'll call it a of x.",00:01:57.487,00:01:59.938
"Now, I want to make just one
slight change in that.",00:01:59.938,00:02:05.000
"I want to use computer
notation, which doesn't use the",00:02:05.000,00:02:08.885
"subscript (a)n.
Instead, this,",00:02:08.885,00:02:11.011
"it thinks of as a function of
the discreet variable,",00:02:11.011,00:02:14.750
"n.
In other words,",00:02:14.750,00:02:15.997
"it's a function which assigns
to n equals zero,",00:02:15.997,00:02:19.369
"one, two, three real numbers.
That's what this sequence of",00:02:19.369,00:02:23.548
"coefficients really is.
So, the computer notation will",00:02:23.548,00:02:27.434
"look almost the same.
It's just that I will write",00:02:27.434,00:02:32.187
"this in functional notation as a
of n instead of (a)n.",00:02:32.187,00:02:37.210
"But, it still means the real
number associated with the",00:02:37.210,00:02:41.584
"positive integer,
n, and everything else is the",00:02:41.584,00:02:45.311
"same.
See, what I'm thinking of this",00:02:45.311,00:02:48.146
"as doing is taking this discreet
function, which gives me the",00:02:48.146,00:02:53.007
"sequence of coefficients of the
power series,",00:02:53.007,00:02:56.572
"and associating that with the
sum of the power series.",00:02:56.572,00:03:02.000
"Let me give you some very
simple examples,",00:03:02.000,00:03:05.048
"two very simple examples,
which I think you know.",00:03:05.048,00:03:08.617
"Suppose this is a function one.
Now, what do I mean by that?",00:03:08.617,00:03:13.005
"I mean it's the constant
function, one.",00:03:13.005,00:03:15.830
"To every positive integer,
it assigns the number one.",00:03:15.830,00:03:19.697
"Okay, what's a of x?
What I'm saying is,",00:03:19.697,00:03:23.266
"in other words,
in this fancy,",00:03:23.266,00:03:25.423
"mystifying form,
is all of these guys are one,",00:03:25.423,00:03:28.769
"what's a of x?
One plus x plus x squared plus",00:03:28.769,00:03:33.222
"x cubed.
Look, you are supposed to be",00:03:33.222,00:03:37.518
"born knowing what that adds up
to.",00:03:37.518,00:03:39.962
"It adds up to one over one
minus x,",00:03:39.962,00:03:43.518
"except that's the wrong answer.
What's wrong about it?",00:03:43.518,00:03:47.444
"It's not true for every value
of x.",00:03:47.444,00:03:49.962
"That's only true when x is such
that that series converges,",00:03:49.962,00:03:54.259
"and that is only true when x
lies between negative one and",00:03:54.259,00:03:58.481
"one.
So, it's not this function.",00:03:58.481,00:04:03.123
"It's this function with its
domain restricted to be less",00:04:03.123,00:04:07.449
"than one in absolute value.
What does that converge to?",00:04:07.449,00:04:11.696
"If x is bigger than one,
the answer is it doesn't",00:04:11.696,00:04:16.258
"converge.
There's nothing else you can",00:04:16.258,00:04:19.168
"put here.
Okay, let's take another",00:04:19.168,00:04:21.764
"function.
Suppose this is,",00:04:21.764,00:04:23.730
"let's see, one over n
you probably won't know.",00:04:23.730,00:04:29.000
"Let's take one you will know,
one over n factorial.",00:04:29.000,00:04:33.199
Suppose a of n is the function,00:04:33.199,00:04:35.588
"one over n factorial,",00:04:35.588,00:04:38.122
"what's a of x?
So, what I'm asking is,",00:04:38.122,00:04:41.742
"what does this add up to when
the coefficient here is one over",00:04:41.742,00:04:46.158
n factorial?,00:04:46.158,00:04:47.823
"What's summation x to the n
over n factorial?",00:04:47.823,00:04:51.805
It is e to the x.,00:04:51.805,00:04:54.049
"And, this doesn't have to be
qualified because this is true",00:04:54.049,00:04:58.248
"for all values of x.
So, in other words,",00:04:58.248,00:05:02.285
"from this peculiar point of
view, I think of a power as",00:05:02.285,00:05:05.937
"summing the operation,
of summing a power series as",00:05:05.937,00:05:09.318
"taking a discreet function
defined for positive integers,",00:05:09.318,00:05:13.106
"or nonnegative integers,
and doing this funny process.",00:05:13.106,00:05:16.690
"And, out of it comes a
continuous function of some",00:05:16.690,00:05:20.004
"sort.
And, notice what goes in is the",00:05:20.004,00:05:22.439
"variable, n.
But, what comes out is the",00:05:22.439,00:05:25.009
"variable, x.
Well, that's perfectly natural.",00:05:25.009,00:05:29.000
"That's the way a power series
is set up.",00:05:29.000,00:05:32.850
"So, the question I ask is,
this is a discreet situation,",00:05:32.850,00:05:38.281
"a discreet summation.
Suppose I made the summation",00:05:38.281,00:05:43.118
"continuous instead of discreet.
So, I want the continuous",00:05:43.118,00:05:48.648
"analog of what I did over there.
Okay, what would a continuous",00:05:48.648,00:05:54.670
"analog be?
Well, instead of,",00:05:54.670,00:05:57.336
"I'll replace n zero,
one, two, that will be replaced",00:05:57.336,00:06:02.372
"by a continued,
that's a discreet variable.",00:06:02.372,00:06:08.000
"I'll replace it by a continuous
variable, t, which runs from",00:06:08.000,00:06:13.189
"zero to infinity,
and is allowed to take every",00:06:13.189,00:06:17.148
"real value in between instead of
being only allowed to take the",00:06:17.148,00:06:22.601
"values of the positive
nonnegative integers.",00:06:22.601,00:06:27.000
"Okay, well, if I want to use t
instead of n,",00:06:27.000,00:06:30.125
"I clearly cannot sum in the
usual way over all real numbers.",00:06:30.125,00:06:34.414
"But, the way the procedure
which replaces summation over",00:06:34.414,00:06:38.411
"all real numbers is integration.
So, what I'm going to do is",00:06:38.411,00:06:42.700
"replace that sum by the integral
from zero to infinity.",00:06:42.700,00:06:46.625
"That's like the sum from zero
to infinity of what?",00:06:46.625,00:06:50.187
"Well, of some function,
but now n is being replaced by",00:06:50.187,00:06:54.039
"the continuous variable,
t.",00:06:54.039,00:06:55.929
"So, this is going to be a
function of t.",00:06:55.929,00:07:00.000
"And, how about the rest of it?
The rest I will just copy,",00:07:00.000,00:07:04.041
"x to the n'th.
Well, instead of n I have to",00:07:04.041,00:07:07.072
"write t and dt.
And, what's the sum?",00:07:07.072,00:07:09.597
"Well, I'll call the sum,
what's the sum a function of?",00:07:09.597,00:07:13.422
"I integrate out the t.
So, that doesn't appear in the",00:07:13.422,00:07:17.175
"answer.
All that appears is this",00:07:17.175,00:07:19.412
"number, x, this parameter,
x.",00:07:19.412,00:07:21.432
"For each value of x,
like one, two,",00:07:21.432,00:07:23.886
"or 26.3, this integral has a
certain value,",00:07:23.886,00:07:26.917
"and I can calculate it.
So, this is going to end up as",00:07:26.917,00:07:30.742
"a function of x,
just as it did before.",00:07:30.742,00:07:35.000
"Now, I could leave it in that
form, but no mathematician would",00:07:35.000,00:07:39.489
"like to do that,
and very few engineers either.",00:07:39.489,00:07:42.875
"The reason is,
in general, when you do",00:07:42.875,00:07:45.598
"integration and differentiation,
you do not want to have as the",00:07:45.598,00:07:50.162
"base of an exponential something
like x.",00:07:50.162,00:07:53.032
"The only convenient thing to
have is e, and the reason is",00:07:53.032,00:07:57.154
"because it's only e that people
really like to differentiate,",00:07:57.154,00:08:01.571
"e to the something.
The only thing is that people",00:08:01.571,00:08:05.997
"really like to differentiate or
integrate.",00:08:05.997,00:08:08.820
"So, I'm going to make this look
a little better by converting x",00:08:08.820,00:08:13.089
"to the t to the base e.
I remember how to do that.",00:08:13.089,00:08:17.014
"You write x equals e to the log
x and so x to",00:08:17.014,00:08:21.215
"the t will be e to the
log x times t,",00:08:21.215,00:08:25.416
"if you want.
Now, the only problem is I want",00:08:25.416,00:08:28.991
"to make one more little change.
After all, I want to be able to",00:08:28.991,00:08:32.973
"calculate this integral.
And, it's clear that if t is",00:08:32.973,00:08:36.314
"going to infinity,
if I have a number here,",00:08:36.314,00:08:39.012
"for example,
like x equals two,",00:08:39.012,00:08:40.939
"that integral is really quite
unlikely to converge.",00:08:40.939,00:08:44.151
"For example,
if a of t were just",00:08:44.151,00:08:46.720
"the constant function,
one, the integral certainly",00:08:46.720,00:08:49.868
"wouldn't converge.
It would be horrible.",00:08:49.868,00:08:52.373
"That integral only has a chance
of converging if x is a number",00:08:52.373,00:08:56.291
"less than one,
so that when I take bigger and",00:08:56.291,00:08:59.118
"bigger powers of it,
I get smaller and smaller",00:08:59.118,00:09:02.008
"numbers.
Don't forget,",00:09:02.008,00:09:04.831
"this is an improper integral
going all the way up to",00:09:04.831,00:09:08.094
"infinity.
Those need treatment,",00:09:08.094,00:09:10.014
"delicate handling.
All right, so I really want x",00:09:10.014,00:09:13.021
"to be less than one.
Otherwise, that integral is",00:09:13.021,00:09:16.668
"very unlikely to converge.
I'd better have it positive,",00:09:16.668,00:09:20.123
"because if I allow it to be
negative I'm going to get into",00:09:20.123,00:09:23.770
"trouble with negative powers,
see what's minus one,",00:09:23.770,00:09:26.969
"for example,
to the one half when t is one",00:09:26.969,00:09:29.592
"half.
That's already imaginary.",00:09:29.592,00:09:32.689
"I don't want that.
If you've got an exponential,",00:09:32.689,00:09:35.864
"the base has got to be a
positive number.",00:09:35.864,00:09:38.567
"So, I want x to be a positive
number.",00:09:38.567,00:09:41.000
"All right, if x in my actual
practices going to lie between",00:09:41.000,00:09:44.918
"zero and one in order to make
the integral converge,",00:09:44.918,00:09:48.364
"how about log x?
Well, log x,",00:09:48.364,00:09:50.256
"if x is less than one,
so log x is going to be",00:09:50.256,00:09:53.972
"less than zero,
and it's going to go all the",00:09:53.972,00:09:57.824
"way down to negative infinity.
So, this means log x is",00:09:57.824,00:10:02.597
"negative.
In this interesting range of x,",00:10:02.597,00:10:05.376
"the log x is always going to be
negative.",00:10:05.376,00:10:08.155
"And now, I don't like that.
The first place I'd like to",00:10:08.155,00:10:11.907
"call this by a new variable
since no one uses log x as a",00:10:11.907,00:10:15.728
"variable.
And, it would make sense to",00:10:15.728,00:10:18.229
"make it a negative,
to make it negative,",00:10:18.229,00:10:20.938
"that is, to write log x is
equal to negative s.",00:10:20.938,00:10:24.134
"Let's put it on the other side,
in order that since log x is",00:10:24.134,00:10:28.233
"always going to be less than
zero, then s will always be",00:10:28.233,00:10:32.054
"positive.
And it's always more convenient",00:10:32.054,00:10:35.764
"to work with positive numbers
instead of negative numbers.",00:10:35.764,00:10:39.009
"So, if I make those changes,
what happens to the integral?",00:10:39.009,00:10:42.254
"Well, I stress,
all these changes are just",00:10:42.254,00:10:44.588
"cosmetic to make things a little
easier to work with in terms of",00:10:44.588,00:10:48.174
"symbols.
First of all,",00:10:48.174,00:10:49.370
"the a I'm going to change.
I don't want to call it a of t",00:10:49.370,00:10:52.557
"because most people
don't call functions a of t.",00:10:52.557,00:10:55.745
"They call them f of t.
So, I'll call it f of t.",00:10:55.745,00:10:58.876
"x is e to the log x,
which is e to the minus s.",00:10:58.876,00:11:01.779
"So, x has its name changed to e",00:11:01.779,00:11:06.266
"to the minus s.
In other words,",00:11:06.266,00:11:09.556
"I'm using as the new variable
not x any longer but s in order",00:11:09.556,00:11:13.942
"that the base be e.
t, I now raise this to the t'th",00:11:13.942,00:11:17.597
"power, but by the laws of
exponents, that means I simply",00:11:17.597,00:11:21.618
"multiply the exponent by t,
and dt.",00:11:21.618,00:11:24.104
"And now, since I'm calling the
function f of t,",00:11:24.104,00:11:28.125
"the output ought to be called
capital F.",00:11:28.125,00:11:32.000
"But it's now a function,
since I've changed the",00:11:32.000,00:11:35.751
"variable, of s.
It's no longer a function of x.",00:11:35.751,00:11:39.502
"If you like,
you may think of this as a of,",00:11:39.502,00:11:42.927
"what's x?
x is e to the negative s,",00:11:42.927,00:11:46.107
"I guess.
I mean, no one would leave a",00:11:46.107,00:11:49.858
"function in that form.
It's simply a function of s.",00:11:49.858,00:11:53.935
"And, what is that?
So, what have we got,",00:11:53.935,00:11:57.115
"finally?
What we have,",00:11:57.115,00:11:58.828
"dear hearts,
is this thing,",00:11:58.828,00:12:00.948
"which I stress is nothing more
than the continuous analog of",00:12:00.948,00:12:05.759
"the summation of a power series.
This is the discrete version.",00:12:05.759,00:12:12.308
"This is by these perfectly
natural transformations the",00:12:12.308,00:12:16.527
"continuous version of the same
thing.",00:12:16.527,00:12:19.393
"It starts with a function
defined for positive values of",00:12:19.393,00:12:23.771
"t, and turns it into a function
of s.",00:12:23.771,00:12:26.636
"And, this is called the Laplace
transform.",00:12:26.636,00:12:29.900
"Now, if I've done my work
correctly, you should all be",00:12:29.900,00:12:34.119
"saying, oh, is that all?
But, I know you aren't.",00:12:34.119,00:12:37.860
"So, it's okay.
You'll get used to it.",00:12:37.860,00:12:42.000
"The first thing you have to get
used to is one thing some people",00:12:42.000,00:12:46.863
"never get used to,
which is you put in a function",00:12:46.863,00:12:50.569
"of t, and you get out a function
of s.",00:12:50.569,00:12:53.426
"How could that be?
You know, for an operator,",00:12:53.426,00:12:56.823
"you put in 3x,
and you get out three if it's a",00:12:56.823,00:13:00.297
"differentiation operator.
In other words,",00:13:00.297,00:13:04.210
"when you have an operator,
the things we've been talking",00:13:04.210,00:13:08.651
"about the last two or three
weeks in one form or another,",00:13:08.651,00:13:13.171
"at least the variable doesn't
get changed.",00:13:13.171,00:13:16.481
"Well, but for a transform it
does, and that's why it's called",00:13:16.481,00:13:21.325
"a transform.
So, the difference between a",00:13:21.325,00:13:24.554
"transform and an operator is
that for a transform a function",00:13:24.554,00:13:29.317
"of t comes in,
but a function of s comes out.",00:13:29.317,00:13:34.000
"The variable gets changed,
whereas for an operator,",00:13:34.000,00:13:37.258
"f of t goes in and
what comes out is g of t,",00:13:37.258,00:13:40.581
"a function using the
same variable like",00:13:40.581,00:13:43.709
"differentiation is a typical
example of an operator,",00:13:43.709,00:13:47.032
"or the linear differential
operators we've been talking",00:13:47.032,00:13:50.551
"about.
Well, but this doesn't behave",00:13:50.551,00:13:52.832
"that way.
The variable does get changed.",00:13:52.832,00:13:55.373
"That's, in fact,
extremely important in the",00:13:55.373,00:13:58.110
"applications.
In the applications,",00:13:58.110,00:14:01.687
"t usually means the time,
and s very often,",00:14:01.687,00:14:05.230
"not always, but very often is a
variable measuring frequency,",00:14:05.230,00:14:10.292
"for instance.
But, so that's a peculiar thing",00:14:10.292,00:14:14.004
"that's hard to get used to.
But, a good thing is the fact",00:14:14.004,00:14:18.729
"that it's a linear transform.
In other words,",00:14:18.729,00:14:22.441
"it obeys the laws we'd love and
like that the Laplace",00:14:22.441,00:14:26.828
"transform-- oh,
I never gave you any notation",00:14:26.828,00:14:30.540
"for the laplace transform.
Hey, I'd better do that.",00:14:30.540,00:14:35.581
"Okay, so, some notation:
there are two notations that",00:14:35.581,00:14:39.009
"are used.
Your book mostly uses the",00:14:39.009,00:14:41.250
"notation that the laplace
transform of f of t is capital F",00:14:41.250,00:14:45.006
"of s,
uses the same letter but with",00:14:45.006,00:14:48.500
"the same capital.
Now, as you will see,",00:14:48.500,00:14:51.004
"there are some places you
absolutely cannot use that",00:14:51.004,00:14:54.365
"notation.
It may seem strange,",00:14:54.365,00:14:56.277
"looks perfectly natural.
There are certain laws you",00:14:56.277,00:14:59.572
"cannot express using that
notation.",00:14:59.572,00:15:03.000
"It's baffling.
But, if you can't do it this",00:15:03.000,00:15:05.779
"way, you can do it using this
notation instead.",00:15:05.779,00:15:08.823
"One or the other will almost
always work.",00:15:08.823,00:15:11.470
"So, I'll use my little squiggly
notation, but that's what I use.",00:15:11.470,00:15:15.639
"I think it's a little more
vivid, and the trouble is that",00:15:15.639,00:15:19.345
"this piles up too many
parentheses.",00:15:19.345,00:15:21.595
"And, that's always hard to
read.",00:15:21.595,00:15:23.647
"So, I like this better.
So, these are two alternate",00:15:23.647,00:15:26.955
"ways of saying the same thing.
The Laplace transform of this",00:15:26.955,00:15:32.485
"function is that one.
Okay, well, let's use,",00:15:32.485,00:15:36.171
"for the linearity law,
it's definitely best.",00:15:36.171,00:15:39.857
"I really cannot express the
linearity law using the second",00:15:39.857,00:15:44.742
"notation, but using the first
notation, it's a breeze.",00:15:44.742,00:15:49.285
"The Laplace transform of the
sum of two functions is the sum",00:15:49.285,00:15:54.342
"of their Laplace transforms of
each of them separately.",00:15:54.342,00:16:00.000
"Or, better yet,
you could write it that way.",00:16:00.000,00:16:03.037
"Let's write it this way.
That way, it looks more like an",00:16:03.037,00:16:06.922
"operator, L of f plus L of g.",00:16:06.922,00:16:10.030
"And, of the same way,
if you take a function and",00:16:10.030,00:16:13.350
"multiply it by a constant and
take the laplace transform,",00:16:13.350,00:16:17.306
"you can pull the constant
outside.",00:16:17.306,00:16:19.637
"And, of course,
why are these true?",00:16:19.637,00:16:22.039
"These are true just because of
the form of the transform.",00:16:22.039,00:16:25.995
"If I add up f and g,
I simply add up the two",00:16:25.995,00:16:29.033
"corresponding integrals.
In other words,",00:16:29.033,00:16:33.233
"I'm using the fact that the
integral, this definite",00:16:33.233,00:16:37.347
"integral, is itself a linear
operator.",00:16:37.347,00:16:40.390
"Well, that's the general
setting.",00:16:40.390,00:16:43.023
"That's where it comes from,
and that's the notation for it.",00:16:43.023,00:16:47.794
"And, now we have to get to
work.",00:16:47.794,00:16:50.344
"The first thing to do to get
familiar with this is,",00:16:50.344,00:16:54.457
"obviously what we want to do is
say, okay, these were the",00:16:54.457,00:16:59.064
"transforms of some simple
discreet functions.",00:16:59.064,00:17:04.000
"Okay, suppose I put in some
familiar functions,",00:17:04.000,00:17:09.883
"f of t.
What do their Laplace",00:17:09.883,00:17:14.616
"transforms look like?
So, let's do that.",00:17:14.616,00:17:19.604
"So, one of the boards I should
keep stored.",00:17:19.604,00:17:24.976
"Why don't I store on this
board?",00:17:24.976,00:17:28.941
"I'll store on this board the
formulas as we get them.",00:17:28.941,00:17:37.000
"So, let's see,
what should we aim at,",00:17:37.000,00:17:39.539
"first?
Let's first find,",00:17:39.539,00:17:41.162
"and I'll do the calculations on
the sideboard,",00:17:41.162,00:17:44.337
"and we'll see how it works out.
I'm not very sure.",00:17:44.337,00:17:47.794
"In other words,
what's the Laplace transform of",00:17:47.794,00:17:51.039
"the function,
one?",00:17:51.039,00:17:52.239
"Well, there's an even easier
one.",00:17:52.239,00:17:54.496
"What's the Laplace transform of
the function zero?",00:17:54.496,00:17:57.953
"Answer: zero.
Very exciting.",00:17:57.953,00:18:00.997
"What's the Laplace transform of
one?",00:18:00.997,00:18:03.491
"Well, it doesn't turn out the
constant anymore than it turned",00:18:03.491,00:18:07.767
"out to be a constant up there.
Let's calculate it.",00:18:07.767,00:18:11.259
"Now, you can do these
calculations carefully,",00:18:11.259,00:18:14.395
"dotting all the i's,
or pretty carefully,",00:18:14.395,00:18:17.245
"or not carefully at all,
i.e.",00:18:17.245,00:18:19.241
"sloppily.
I'll let you be sloppy after,",00:18:19.241,00:18:21.949
"generally speaking,
you could be sloppy unless the",00:18:21.949,00:18:25.441
"directions tell you to be less
sloppy or to be careful,",00:18:25.441,00:18:29.289
"okay?
So, I'll do one carefully.",00:18:29.289,00:18:32.786
"Let's calculate the Laplace
transform of one carefully.",00:18:32.786,00:18:36.497
"Okay, in the beginning,
you've got nothing to use with",00:18:36.497,00:18:40.139
"the definition.
So, I have to calculate the",00:18:40.139,00:18:43.025
"integral from zero to infinity
of one, that's the f of t times",00:18:43.025,00:18:47.216
"e to the negative s t,
so I don't have to",00:18:47.216,00:18:51.133
"put in the one,
dt.",00:18:51.133,00:18:52.370
"All right, now,
let me remind you,",00:18:52.370,00:18:54.638
"this is an improper integral.
This is just about the first",00:18:54.638,00:18:58.555
"time in the course we've had an
improper integral.",00:18:58.555,00:19:01.922
"But, there are going to be a
lot of them over the next couple",00:19:01.922,00:19:06.045
"of weeks, nothing but.
All right, it's an improper",00:19:06.045,00:19:10.622
"integral.
That means we have to go back",00:19:10.622,00:19:12.907
"to the definition.
If you want to be careful,",00:19:12.907,00:19:15.551
"you have to go back to the
definition of improper integral.",00:19:15.551,00:19:19.038
"So, it's the limit,
as R goes to infinity,",00:19:19.038,00:19:21.502
"of what you get by integrating
only up as far as R.",00:19:21.502,00:19:24.508
"That's a definite integral.
That's a nice Riemann integral.",00:19:24.508,00:19:27.994
"So, this is what I have to
calculate.",00:19:27.994,00:19:31.000
"And, I have to take the limit
as R goes to infinity.",00:19:31.000,00:19:34.162
"Now, how do I calculate that?
Well, this integral is equal",00:19:34.162,00:19:37.697
"to, that's easy.
It's just integrating.",00:19:37.697,00:19:40.054
"Remember that you're
integrating with respect to t.",00:19:40.054,00:19:43.155
"So, s is a parameter.
It's like a constant,",00:19:43.155,00:19:45.759
"in other words.
So, it's e to the minus s t,",00:19:45.759,00:19:48.364
"and when I differentiated,",00:19:48.364,00:19:50.720
"the derivative of this would
have negative s.",00:19:50.720,00:19:53.449
"So, to get rid of that negative
s, so the derivative is e to the",00:19:53.449,00:19:57.356
"minus s t.
You have to put minus s",00:19:57.356,00:20:00.581
"in the denominator.
And now, I'll want to evaluate",00:20:00.581,00:20:05.643
"that between zero and R.
And, what do I get?",00:20:05.643,00:20:09.431
"Well it is at the upper limit.
So, it's e to the minus s times",00:20:09.431,00:20:14.806
"R minus, at the lower limit,
it's t is equal to zero,",00:20:14.806,00:20:19.387
"so whatever s is,
it's one.",00:20:19.387,00:20:21.678
"And that's divided by this
constant up front,",00:20:21.678,00:20:25.555
"negative s. So,",00:20:25.555,00:20:28.991
"the answer is,
it is equal to the limit of,",00:20:28.991,00:20:32.691
"as R goes to infinity,
of e to the negative s R minus",00:20:32.691,00:20:37.273
one divided by minus s.,00:20:37.273,00:20:43.000
"Now, what's that?
Well, as R goes to infinity,",00:20:43.000,00:20:47.151
"e to the minus 2R,
or minus 5R goes to zero,",00:20:47.151,00:20:52.225
"and the answer is minus one
over minus s.",00:20:52.225,00:20:57.022
"So, that's one over s.
And so, that's our answer.",00:20:57.022,00:21:02.188
"Let's put it up here.
It's one over s,",00:21:02.188,00:21:05.601
"except it isn't.
I made a mistake.",00:21:05.601,00:21:10.727
"Well, not mistake,
a little oversight.",00:21:10.727,00:21:16.663
"What's the oversight?
This is okay.",00:21:16.663,00:21:22.117
"This is okay.
This is okay.",00:21:22.117,00:21:26.288
"This is not okay.
This is okay.",00:21:26.288,00:21:31.101
"But that's not okay.
What's wrong?",00:21:31.101,00:21:38.000
"I did slight a verbal hand.
Maybe some of you have picked",00:21:38.000,00:21:41.490
"it up and were too embarrassed
to correct me,",00:21:41.490,00:21:44.232
"but I said like e to the minus
2R obviously goes to",00:21:44.232,00:21:48.096
"zero, and e to the minus 5R
goes to zero.",00:21:48.096,00:21:51.337
"How about e to the minus minus
3 R?",00:21:51.337,00:21:54.390
"Does that go to zero?
No, that's e to the 3R,",00:21:54.390,00:21:57.070
which goes to infinity.,00:21:57.070,00:22:00.000
"The only time this goes to zero
is if s is a positive number.",00:22:00.000,00:22:05.835
"Minus s looks like a negative
number, but it's not,",00:22:05.835,00:22:10.698
"if s is equal to minus two.
So, this is only true if s is",00:22:10.698,00:22:16.144
"positive because only if s is
positive is this exponent really",00:22:16.144,00:22:22.077
"negative and large,
and therefore going to",00:22:22.077,00:22:26.064
"infinity, going to zero as R
goes to infinity.",00:22:26.064,00:22:30.441
"So, the answer is not one over
s.",00:22:30.441,00:22:34.331
"It is one over s,
s must positive.",00:22:34.331,00:22:39.000
"Now, once again,
here, people don't worry about",00:22:39.000,00:22:41.995
"this sort of thing with power
series because it seems very",00:22:41.995,00:22:45.706
"obvious, you know,
one over x,",00:22:45.706,00:22:48.116
"absolute value of x is less
than one,",00:22:48.116,00:22:51.241
"when it gets to be the Laplace
transform, just because the",00:22:51.241,00:22:54.953
"Laplace transform is mysterious,
the question is,",00:22:54.953,00:22:58.079
"okay, the Laplace transform is
one over s of one,",00:22:58.079,00:23:01.204
"well, Laplace transform of one
I understand is one over s if s",00:23:01.204,00:23:05.176
"is positive.
What is it if s is negative?",00:23:05.176,00:23:09.862
"Okay, right down in your little
books, this, but that down,",00:23:09.862,00:23:15.791
"what is it if s is negative,
and write underneath that,",00:23:15.791,00:23:21.311
"this question is meaningless.
It doesn't mean anything.",00:23:21.311,00:23:26.831
"I'll draw you a picture.
This is a picture of the",00:23:26.831,00:23:31.931
"Laplace transform of one.
It is that.",00:23:31.931,00:23:34.827
"It's one branch of this curve.
It does not include the branch",00:23:34.827,00:23:39.655
"on the left.
It doesn't because I showed you",00:23:39.655,00:23:43.114
"it doesn't.
That's all there is to it.",00:23:43.114,00:23:46.091
"Okay, so I did that carefully.
Now I'm going to get a little",00:23:46.091,00:23:50.839
"less careful.
What's the Laplace transform of",00:23:50.839,00:23:54.379
"e to the a t?
First of all,",00:23:54.379,00:23:57.597
"in general, the kind of
functions for which people like",00:23:57.597,00:24:01.942
"to calculate the Laplace
transform, and basically the",00:24:01.942,00:24:06.126
"only ones there will be in the
tables are exactly the sort of",00:24:06.126,00:24:10.954
"functions that you used in
solving linear equations with",00:24:10.954,00:24:15.379
"constant coefficients.
What kinds of functions entered",00:24:15.379,00:24:21.092
"in there?
Exponentials,",00:24:21.092,00:24:22.576
"sines and cosines,
but they were really complex",00:24:22.576,00:24:25.680
"exponentials,
right?",00:24:25.680,00:24:26.963
"e to the t sine t,
but that was really a",00:24:26.963,00:24:30.607
"complex exponential,
too, just a little more",00:24:30.607,00:24:33.509
"complicated one,
polynomials,",00:24:33.509,00:24:35.398
"and that's about it.
t times e to the t,",00:24:35.398,00:24:38.705
"that was okay,
too.",00:24:38.705,00:24:41.000
"These are the functions for
which people calculate the",00:24:41.000,00:24:44.242
"Laplace transform,
and all the other functions",00:24:44.242,00:24:46.994
"they don't calculate the Laplace
transforms.",00:24:46.994,00:24:49.625
"So, I don't mean to disappoint
you here.",00:24:49.625,00:24:52.010
"You're going to say,
oh, what, that same old stuff?",00:24:52.010,00:24:55.069
"For two more weeks,
we've got that same,",00:24:55.069,00:24:57.454
"well, the Laplace transform
does a lot of things much better",00:24:57.454,00:25:01.063
"than the methods we've been
using.",00:25:01.063,00:25:04.000
"And, I won't.
I'll sell it when I get a",00:25:04.000,00:25:06.410
"chance to, for now,
let's just get familiar with",00:25:06.410,00:25:09.391
"it.
All right, so while I'm not",00:25:09.391,00:25:11.293
"going to calculate e to the a t
for you,",00:25:11.293,00:25:14.465
"because I'd like instead to
just prove a simple formula",00:25:14.465,00:25:17.890
"which will just give that,
and will also give us e to the",00:25:17.890,00:25:21.441
"a t sine t.
It will give us a lot more,",00:25:21.441,00:25:24.993
"instead.
I'm going to calculate a",00:25:24.993,00:25:27.023
"formula for the Laplace
transform of this guy if you",00:25:27.023,00:25:30.257
"already know the Laplace
transform of it.",00:25:30.257,00:25:34.000
"Now, see, this falls in that
category because this is really",00:25:34.000,00:25:38.458
e to the a t times one.,00:25:38.458,00:25:41.178
"But, I already know the Laplace
transform of one.",00:25:41.178,00:25:44.806
"So that's, if I can get a
general formula for this,",00:25:44.806,00:25:48.584
"I'll be able to get the formula
for e to the a t as a",00:25:48.584,00:25:53.345
"consequence.
So, let's look for this Laplace",00:25:53.345,00:25:56.594
"transform.
Now, it's really easy.",00:25:56.594,00:25:59.012
"Let's see, where am I doing
calculations?",00:25:59.012,00:26:02.035
"Over here.
Okay, so we've got e.",00:26:02.035,00:26:05.413
"So, I want to calculate the
Laplace transform e to the a t f",00:26:05.413,00:26:09.386
"of t.
So I'm going to say that's the",00:26:09.386,00:26:13.022
"integral from zero to infinity
of e to the a t times f of t.",00:26:13.022,00:26:16.927
"And now, the rest I copy.",00:26:16.927,00:26:19.688
"That's the function part of it
that goes to the input,",00:26:19.688,00:26:23.256
"and then there's the other
part.",00:26:23.256,00:26:25.344
"This part is called the kernel,
by the way, but don't worry",00:26:25.344,00:26:29.249
"about that.
However, if you drop it in",00:26:29.249,00:26:33.264
"conversation,
people will look at you and",00:26:33.264,00:26:36.747
"say, gee, they know something I
don't.",00:26:36.747,00:26:39.969
"And you will.
You know that it's the kernel.",00:26:39.969,00:26:43.714
"Okay, well, now,
what kind of formula can I be",00:26:43.714,00:26:47.633
"looking for?
Clearly, I can only be looking",00:26:47.633,00:26:51.291
"for a formula which expresses it
in terms of the Laplace",00:26:51.291,00:26:56.081
"transform of f of t.
Let's calculate and see what we",00:26:56.081,00:27:02.062
"get.
Now, what would you do to that",00:27:02.062,00:27:04.323
"thing to make?
Well, obviously,",00:27:04.323,00:27:06.319
"the thing to do is to combine
the two exponentials.",00:27:06.319,00:27:09.645
"So, that's going to be the
integral from zero to infinity",00:27:09.645,00:27:13.370
"of f of t.
e, now, I'd like to put it,",00:27:13.370,00:27:16.430
"to combine the exponentials in
such a way that it has,",00:27:16.430,00:27:19.955
"still, that same form,
so, I'm going to begin with",00:27:19.955,00:27:23.215
"that negative sign,
and then see what the rest of",00:27:23.215,00:27:26.407
"it has to be.
What is it going to be?",00:27:26.407,00:27:30.000
"Well, minus s t and
plus a t,",00:27:30.000,00:27:34.137
"but I can make that minus a
here, and it will come out",00:27:34.137,00:27:39.122
"right.
So, it's minus s t plus a t,",00:27:39.122,00:27:42.225
"and there are the two parts,",00:27:42.225,00:27:46.081
"those two factors,
dt.",00:27:46.081,00:27:48.056
"So, what's that?
That's the Laplace transform.",00:27:48.056,00:27:52.288
"If the a weren't there,
this would be the Laplace",00:27:52.288,00:27:56.802
"transform of f of t.
What is it with the a there?",00:27:56.802,00:28:03.242
"It's the Laplace transform of f
of t,",00:28:03.242,00:28:08.799
"except that instead of the
variable, s has been replaced by",00:28:08.799,00:28:15.515
the variable s minus a.,00:28:15.515,00:28:19.915
"I'll give you a second to
digest that.",00:28:19.915,00:28:24.200
"Well, you digest it while I'm
writing it because that's the",00:28:24.200,00:28:30.915
"answer.
And, the way this is most often",00:28:30.915,00:28:35.607
"used, I have to qualify it for
the value.",00:28:35.607,00:28:38.971
"So, if F of s is good
for s positive,",00:28:38.971,00:28:42.757
"the way it would be,
for example,",00:28:42.757,00:28:45.448
"if I used the function one
here, then to finish that off,",00:28:45.448,00:28:50.158
"then, F of s minus a will be,",00:28:50.158,00:28:53.607
"this will be good when s is
bigger than a.",00:28:53.607,00:28:57.897
"Why is that?
Well, because this is true.",00:28:57.897,00:29:02.501
"This is true.
If s minus a is",00:29:02.501,00:29:06.022
"positive, that's the condition.
That's what this Laplace",00:29:06.022,00:29:11.118
"transform is good.
But that simply says that s",00:29:11.118,00:29:15.287
should be bigger than a.,00:29:15.287,00:29:18.345
"And, since this doesn't look
pretty, let me try to make it",00:29:18.345,00:29:23.626
"look a little bit prettier.
So, let's write it.",00:29:23.626,00:29:29.000
"So, this is assuming F of s is
for s greater than zero.",00:29:29.000,00:29:34.984
"Now, this is called something.",00:29:34.984,00:29:38.712
"This is called,
well, what would you call it?",00:29:38.712,00:29:43.028
"On the left side,
you multiply by an exponential.",00:29:43.028,00:29:47.737
"On the right,
you translate.",00:29:47.737,00:29:50.386
"You shift the argument over by
a.",00:29:50.386,00:29:53.525
"So, this is called,
gulp, the exponential shift.",00:29:53.525,00:29:58.136
"What?
Well, I'll call it the formula.",00:29:58.136,00:30:02.489
"The thing before,
when we talked about operators,",00:30:02.489,00:30:06.344
"we called it the exponential
shift rule or the exponential",00:30:06.344,00:30:10.922
"shift law.
But, in fact,",00:30:10.922,00:30:12.769
"this is, in a way,
a disguised form of the same",00:30:12.769,00:30:16.463
"law.
And, engineers who typically do",00:30:16.463,00:30:19.274
"all their work using the Laplace
transform and don't use",00:30:19.274,00:30:23.691
"operators, this is the form of
the exponential shift law that",00:30:23.691,00:30:28.510
"they would know.
What you can do with one,",00:30:28.510,00:30:33.125
"you can do with the other.
You can now use both.",00:30:33.125,00:30:37.119
"So, what's the answer to e to
the a t?",00:30:37.119,00:30:41.200
"Well, the answer is,
I'm supposed to,",00:30:41.200,00:30:44.259
"e to the a t times one,
the Laplace transform of one is",00:30:44.259,00:30:48.849
"one over s.
And, therefore,",00:30:48.849,00:30:51.740
"what I do is to multiply by e
to the a t, I change s to s",00:30:51.740,00:30:56.500
"minus a .
And so, that's the answer.",00:30:56.500,00:31:00.750
"Let's see, what else don't we
know?",00:31:00.750,00:31:05.000
"Well, how about sines and
cosines?",00:31:05.000,00:31:08.960
"Well, the way to do sines and
cosines is by making the",00:31:08.960,00:31:15.319
"observation that this formula
also works when a is a complex",00:31:15.319,00:31:22.400
"number.
So, can use also for a a",00:31:22.400,00:31:26.119
"complex number, for e to 
the a plus b i times t.",00:31:26.119,00:31:31.640
The Laplace transform of e to,00:31:31.640,00:31:37.126
"the a plus b i times t is one
over s minus a plus b i.",00:31:37.126,00:31:40.938
"And again, it will be for s
bigger than a.",00:31:43.944,00:31:47.683
"So, let's calculate the Laplace
transform of,",00:31:47.683,00:31:50.909
"let's say, well,
I've got to cover up something.",00:31:50.909,00:31:54.354
"Okay, so, that's the Laplace
transform.",00:31:54.354,00:31:57.140
"I've got to remember that.
So, let's calculate the Laplace",00:31:57.140,00:32:02.454
"transform of,
let's say, sine of a t",00:32:02.454,00:32:05.226
and cosine a t.,00:32:05.226,00:32:08.235
"What do you get for that?
Well, just for a little",00:32:08.235,00:32:12.036
"variety, we could do it by using
that formula,",00:32:12.036,00:32:15.599
"and taking its real and
imaginary parts.",00:32:15.599,00:32:18.687
"Since some of you had so much
difficulty with the backwards",00:32:18.687,00:32:23.280
"Euler formula,
he is a good case where you",00:32:23.280,00:32:26.527
"could use it.
Suppose you want to calculate",00:32:26.527,00:32:29.852
"the Laplace transform of cosine
a t.",00:32:29.852,00:32:35.000
"Well, I'm going to write that
using, I want to calculate using",00:32:35.000,00:32:39.554
"complex exponentials.
The way I will do it is by",00:32:39.554,00:32:43.064
"using the backwards Euler
formula.",00:32:43.064,00:32:45.528
"So, this is e to the i a t plus
e to the minus i a t divided by",00:32:45.528,00:32:50.157
two.,00:32:50.157,00:32:52.546
"Remember, the foreword Euler
formula would say e to the i a t",00:32:52.546,00:32:57.026
"equals cosine a t plus i sine a
t.",00:32:57.026,00:33:01.208
That expresses the complex,00:33:01.208,00:33:04.769
"exponential in terms of sines
and cosines.",00:33:04.769,00:33:07.560
"This is the backward formula,
which just read it backwards,",00:33:07.560,00:33:11.507
"expressing cosines and sines in
terms of complex exponentials",00:33:11.507,00:33:15.591
"instead.
Both formulas are useful,",00:33:15.591,00:33:17.837
"almost equally useful,
in fact.",00:33:17.837,00:33:19.879
"And anyway, just remind you of
it, let's use this one.",00:33:19.879,00:33:23.486
"Okay, what's the Laplace
transform, then,",00:33:23.486,00:33:26.209
"of cosine a t?
Well, by linearity,",00:33:26.209,00:33:30.669
"it's equal to one half the
Laplace transform of this guy",00:33:30.669,00:33:35.501
"plus the Laplace transform of
that guy.",00:33:35.501,00:33:38.839
"And, what are those?
Well, the Laplace transform of",00:33:38.839,00:33:43.232
"e to the i a t is one over s
minus i a,",00:33:43.232,00:33:48.416
"and the Laplace
transform of the other guy is",00:33:48.416,00:33:53.072
one divided by s plus i a.,00:33:53.072,00:33:56.762
"Now, of course,
this has become out to be a",00:33:56.762,00:34:00.452
"real function.
This is real.",00:34:00.452,00:34:03.951
"Every integral is real.
This must come out to be real.",00:34:03.951,00:34:07.832
"This looks kind of complex,
but it isn't.",00:34:07.832,00:34:10.761
"I know automatically that this
is going to be a real function.",00:34:10.761,00:34:15.227
"How I know that?
Well, mentally,",00:34:15.227,00:34:17.497
"you can combine the terms and
calculate.",00:34:17.497,00:34:20.352
"But, I know even before that.
Remember, there are two ways to",00:34:20.352,00:34:24.745
"see that something is real.
You can calculate it and see",00:34:24.745,00:34:28.772
"that its imaginary part is zero,
hack, or without any",00:34:28.772,00:34:32.579
"calculation, if you change i to
minus i,",00:34:32.579,00:34:36.387
"and you get the same thing,
it must be real.",00:34:36.387,00:34:41.000
"Now, if I change i to minus i
in this expression,",00:34:41.000,00:34:45.421
"what happens?
If I change i to minus i,",00:34:45.421,00:34:48.921
"this term turns into that one,
and this one turns into that",00:34:48.921,00:34:54.263
"one.
Conclusion: the sum of the two",00:34:54.263,00:34:57.394
"is unchanged.
And therefore,",00:34:57.394,00:34:59.881
"this is real.
Well, of course,",00:34:59.881,00:35:03.066
"in the time I took to make that
argument, I could have actually",00:35:03.066,00:35:07.199
"calculated it.
So, what the heck,",00:35:07.199,00:35:09.333
"let's calculate it?
So, you do the high school",00:35:09.333,00:35:12.333
"thing, and it's this guy plus
that guy on top,",00:35:12.333,00:35:15.333
"which makes 2s.
I on the bottom is the product",00:35:15.333,00:35:18.333
"of those, which by now you
should know the product of two",00:35:18.333,00:35:22.066
"complex numbers.
A product of a number and its",00:35:22.066,00:35:25.066
"complex conjugate is the sum of
the squares.",00:35:25.066,00:35:29.000
"So, what's the answer?
The twos cancel,",00:35:29.000,00:35:31.618
"and the answer is that the
Laplace transform of cosine a t",00:35:31.618,00:35:35.545
"is s over s squared plus a
squared.",00:35:35.545,00:35:39.472
"And, that will be true as,",00:35:39.472,00:35:41.883
"in general, it's true up there
for positive values of s only.",00:35:41.883,00:35:46.017
"And, the sine a t,
you can calculate that in",00:35:46.017,00:35:49.875
"recitation tomorrow.
The answer to that is a divided",00:35:49.875,00:35:53.389
by s squared plus a squared.,00:35:53.389,00:35:56.627
"You would get the same answers
if you took the real and",00:35:56.627,00:36:00.348
"imaginary parts of that
expression.",00:36:00.348,00:36:04.000
"It's another way of getting at
the recitations tomorrow;",00:36:04.000,00:36:08.254
"we'll get practice in
calculating other functions",00:36:08.254,00:36:11.966
"related to these by using these
formulas, and also from scratch",00:36:11.966,00:36:16.762
"directly from the definition of
the Laplace transform.",00:36:16.762,00:36:20.861
"Well, there are two things
which we still should do.",00:36:20.861,00:36:24.806
"The first is I want to get you
started with calculating inverse",00:36:24.806,00:36:29.602
"Laplace transforms.
And, the reason for doing that",00:36:29.602,00:36:33.943
"is, in other words,
I've started with f of t,",00:36:33.943,00:36:36.729
"and we've been focusing
on what is capital F of s?",00:36:36.729,00:36:40.357
"But, you will find that when",00:36:40.357,00:36:42.883
"you go to solve differential
equations, by far,",00:36:42.883,00:36:45.863
"the hardest part of the
procedure is you get F of s.",00:36:45.863,00:36:49.167
"The Laplace transform of the
answer, and you have to convert",00:36:49.167,00:36:52.990
"that back into the answer in
terms of t that you were looking",00:36:52.990,00:36:56.877
"for.
In other words,",00:36:56.877,00:36:58.107
"the main step in the procedure
that you are going to be using",00:36:58.107,00:37:01.995
"for solving differential
equations is,",00:37:01.995,00:37:04.392
"and the hardest part of the
step will be to calculate",00:37:04.392,00:37:07.760
"inverse laplace transforms.
Now, you think that could be",00:37:07.760,00:37:13.315
"done by tables,
but, in fact,",00:37:13.315,00:37:15.631
"it can't unless the tables are
too long to be useful.",00:37:15.631,00:37:19.932
"You have to do a certain amount
of work yourself.",00:37:19.932,00:37:23.902
"And, the certain amount of work
that you have to do yourself",00:37:23.902,00:37:28.781
"involves partial fractions
decompositions.",00:37:28.781,00:37:33.000
"And, in case you were wondering
which you are not,",00:37:33.000,00:37:36.655
"the reason you learned partial
fractions in 18.01 was not to",00:37:36.655,00:37:41.056
"learn those silly integrals,
but he learned it so that when",00:37:41.056,00:37:45.383
"you got to 18.03 you would be
able to calculate,",00:37:45.383,00:37:48.889
"solve differential equations by
using Laplace transforms.",00:37:48.889,00:37:53.066
"Sorry.
That's life.",00:37:53.066,00:37:54.409
"Now, so a certain amount of the
recitation time tomorrow will be",00:37:54.409,00:37:59.108
"devoted to reminding you how to
do partial fractions since you",00:37:59.108,00:38:03.659
"haven't done it in a while,
and I assume,",00:38:03.659,00:38:06.643
"yeah, we had that,
I think.",00:38:06.643,00:38:10.000
"Okay, now, they also remind you
of the most efficient method,",00:38:10.000,00:38:16.970
"which about half of you have
had, and the rest think you",00:38:16.970,00:38:23.360
"might have had,
but really aren't sure.",00:38:23.360,00:38:27.775
"So, here's the answer.
We want to find out what it's",00:38:27.775,00:38:33.701
"inverse Laplace transform is.
What you have to do,",00:38:33.701,00:38:39.306
"it normally won't be in the
tables like this.",00:38:39.306,00:38:42.180
"You have to put it in a form in
which it will be in the tables.",00:38:42.180,00:38:46.229
"As you do that,
you have to make partial",00:38:46.229,00:38:48.777
"fractions decompositions,
which, to do it quickly,",00:38:48.777,00:38:51.977
"so if you don't know what I'm
doing now, or you think you once",00:38:51.977,00:38:55.961
"knew but don't quite remember,
go to recitation tomorrow.",00:38:55.961,00:38:59.619
"To get the coefficient here,
I cover up s,",00:38:59.619,00:39:02.297
"and I put s equals zero
because that's the law.",00:39:02.297,00:39:07.000
"To get this coefficient,
I cover up s plus three and I",00:39:07.000,00:39:10.713
"put s equals a negative three
because that's what you're",00:39:10.713,00:39:14.566
"supposed to do.
Put s equal negative three,",00:39:14.566,00:39:17.509
"you get minus one third.
This is equal to that.",00:39:17.509,00:39:20.732
"In this form,
I don't know what the inverse",00:39:20.732,00:39:23.675
"Laplace form is,
but in this form,",00:39:23.675,00:39:25.987
"I certainly do know with the
inverse Laplace transform",00:39:25.987,00:39:29.700
"because the inverse Laplace
transform is linear,",00:39:29.700,00:39:32.993
"and because each of these guys
especially occurs in those",00:39:32.993,00:39:36.917
"tables.
Well, what's this?",00:39:36.917,00:39:40.000
"Well, it's whatever the Laplace
transform of,",00:39:40.000,00:39:43.849
"inverse Laplace transform of
one over s is multiplied by one",00:39:43.849,00:39:49.012
"third.
Well, the inverse Laplace",00:39:49.012,00:39:51.724
"transform of one over s is one.
So, it's one third times one.",00:39:51.724,00:39:56.974
"How about the other guy?
Minus one third,",00:39:56.974,00:40:00.474
"the inverse Laplace transform
of one over s plus three,",00:40:00.474,00:40:05.199
"that's this formula.
a is negative three,",00:40:05.199,00:40:09.666
"and that makes e to the minus
3t.",00:40:09.666,00:40:13.333
"So, if this was the Laplace
transform of the solution to the",00:40:13.333,00:40:18.250
"differential equation,
then the solution in terms of t",00:40:18.250,00:40:22.666
"was this function.
Now, you'll get lots of",00:40:22.666,00:40:26.083
"practice in that.
All I'm doing now is signaling",00:40:26.083,00:40:30.000
"that that's the most important
and difficult step of the",00:40:30.000,00:40:34.583
"procedure, and that,
please, start getting practice.",00:40:34.583,00:40:40.000
"Get up to snuff doing that
procedure.",00:40:40.000,00:40:42.468
"Okay, in the time remaining,
I want to add one formula to",00:40:42.468,00:40:46.308
"this list, and that is going to
be the Laplace transform of,",00:40:46.308,00:40:50.354
"we still haven't done
polynomials.",00:40:50.354,00:40:52.617
"And now, to polynomials,
because the Laplace transform",00:40:52.617,00:40:56.251
"is linear, all I have to do is
know what the Laplace transform",00:40:56.251,00:41:00.434
"of, the individual term of a
polynomial.",00:41:00.434,00:41:04.000
"In other words,
what the Laplace transform of t",00:41:04.000,00:41:07.571
"to the n,
where n is some positive",00:41:07.571,00:41:10.987
"integer?
Well, let's bravely start",00:41:10.987,00:41:13.548
"trying to calculate it.
Integral from zero to infinity",00:41:13.548,00:41:17.663
"t to the n e to the negative st
dt.",00:41:17.663,00:41:22.554
"Now, I think you can see that",00:41:22.554,00:41:26.513
"the method you should use is
integration by part because this",00:41:26.513,00:41:31.171
"is a product of two things,
one of which you would like to",00:41:31.171,00:41:35.597
"differentiate a lot of times,
in fact, and the other won't",00:41:35.597,00:41:40.022
"hurt to integrate it because
it's very easy to integrate.",00:41:40.022,00:41:44.369
"So, this factor is going to be",00:41:44.369,00:41:48.033
"the one that's to be
differentiated,",00:41:48.033,00:41:50.406
"and this is the factor that
will be pleased to integrate it.",00:41:50.406,00:41:54.406
"Let's get started and see what
we can get out of it.",00:41:54.406,00:41:57.864
"Well, this time I'm going to
be, well, I'd better be a little",00:41:57.864,00:42:01.932
"careful because there's a point
here that's tricky.",00:42:01.932,00:42:06.000
"Okay, the first step of
integration by parts is you only",00:42:06.000,00:42:10.034
"do the integration.
You don't do the",00:42:10.034,00:42:12.601
"differentiation.
Remember, the variable is t.",00:42:12.601,00:42:15.828
"The s is just a parameter.
It's just a constant.",00:42:15.828,00:42:19.276
"It's hanging around,
not knowing what to do.",00:42:19.276,00:42:22.430
"Okay, so the first step is you
don't do the differentiation.",00:42:22.430,00:42:26.757
"You only do the integration.
Evaluate it between limits,",00:42:26.757,00:42:30.792
"and then you put a minus sign
before you forget to do it.",00:42:30.792,00:42:36.000
"And then, integral zero to
infinity.",00:42:36.000,00:42:38.800
"Now you do both operations.
So, it's n t to the n ",00:42:38.800,00:42:43.440
"minus one,
and you also do the",00:42:43.440,00:42:46.079
"integration.
Okay, let's consider each of",00:42:46.079,00:42:49.280
"these pieces in turn.
Now, this piece,",00:42:49.280,00:42:52.239
"well, there's no problem with
the lower limit,",00:42:52.239,00:42:55.840
"zero, because when t is equal
to zero, this factor is zero,",00:42:55.840,00:43:00.480
"and the thing disappears as
long as n is one or higher.",00:43:00.480,00:43:06.000
"So, it's minus zero here at the
lower limit.",00:43:06.000,00:43:10.503
"The question is,
what is at the upper limit?",00:43:10.503,00:43:15.006
"So, what I have to do is find
out, what is the limit?",00:43:15.006,00:43:20.452
"The limit, as t goes to
infinity, that's what's",00:43:20.452,00:43:25.270
"happening up there,
of t to the n times e to the",00:43:25.270,00:43:30.192
"negative s t divided
by minus s.",00:43:30.192,00:43:37.000
"Well, as t goes to infinity,
this goes to infinity,",00:43:37.000,00:43:40.508
"of course.
This had better go to zero",00:43:40.508,00:43:43.035
"unless I want an answer,
infinity, which won't do me any",00:43:43.035,00:43:46.894
"good.
If this goes to zero,",00:43:46.894,00:43:48.719
"s had better be positive.
So, I'd better be restricting",00:43:48.719,00:43:52.508
"myself to that case.
Okay, so let's assume that s is",00:43:52.508,00:43:56.087
"positive so that this minus s
really is a negative number.",00:43:56.087,00:44:01.000
"Okay, then I have a chance.
So, this is going to be the",00:44:01.000,00:44:04.623
"limit.
Let's write it in a more",00:44:04.623,00:44:06.636
"familiar form with that down
below.",00:44:06.636,00:44:08.917
"So, it's t to the n.
That's going to infinity.",00:44:08.917,00:44:12.474
"But, the bottom is e to the
minus s t.",00:44:12.474,00:44:15.761
"But now, it's plus s t.
And, that's going to infinity,",00:44:15.761,00:44:19.854
"too, because s is positive.
So, the two guys are racing,",00:44:19.854,00:44:23.545
"and the question is,
oh, I lost a minus s here.",00:44:23.545,00:44:26.632
"So, oh... equals minus
one over s.",00:44:26.632,00:44:30.054
"How's that?
So, the question is only,",00:44:30.054,00:44:33.557
"which guy wins?
In the race to infinity,",00:44:33.557,00:44:35.986
"which one wins,
and how do you decide?",00:44:35.986,00:44:38.291
"And, the answer,
of course, is that's the bottom",00:44:38.291,00:44:41.218
"that wins.
The exponential always wins,",00:44:41.218,00:44:43.585
"and it's because of L'Hopital's
rule.",00:44:43.585,00:44:45.828
"You differentiate top and
bottom.",00:44:45.828,00:44:47.821
"Nothing much happens to the
bottom.",00:44:47.821,00:44:49.939
"It gets another factor of s,
but the top goes down to t to",00:44:49.939,00:44:53.489
"the n minus one.
L'Hopital it again,",00:44:53.489,00:44:56.542
"and again, and again,
and again, and again until",00:44:56.542,00:44:59.469
"finally you've reduced the top
to t to the zero where it's",00:44:59.469,00:45:03.020
"defenseless and just sitting
there, and nothing's happened to",00:45:03.020,00:45:06.757
"the bottom.
It's still got e to the s t.",00:45:06.757,00:45:11.493
and that goes to infinity.,00:45:11.493,00:45:14.911
"So, the answer is,
this is zero by n applications",00:45:14.911,00:45:19.345
"of L'Hopital's rule.
Or, if you're very clever,",00:45:19.345,00:45:23.594
"you can do it in one,
but I won't tell you how.",00:45:23.594,00:45:27.843
"So, the answer is that this is
zero.",00:45:27.843,00:45:32.000
"At the upper limit,
it's also zero at least if s is",00:45:32.000,00:45:35.298
"positive, which is the case
we're considering.",00:45:35.298,00:45:38.267
"That leaves the rest of this.
All right, let's pull the",00:45:38.267,00:45:41.829
"constants out front.
That's plus.",00:45:41.829,00:45:43.940
"Two negatives make a plus.
n over s,",00:45:43.940,00:45:46.909
"now, what's left?
The integral from zero to",00:45:46.909,00:45:49.680
"infinity of t to the n minus
one, e to the minus s t dt.",00:45:49.680,00:45:53.243
"But, what on Earth is that?
That is n over s times",00:45:57.003,00:46:00.763
"the Laplace transform of t to
the n minus one.",00:46:00.763,00:46:04.524
"We got a reduction for it.
We don't get the answer in one",00:46:04.524,00:46:08.218
"step.
But, we get a reduction",00:46:08.218,00:46:11.518
"formula.
And, it says that the Laplace",00:46:11.518,00:46:13.960
"transform, let me write it this
way for once.",00:46:13.960,00:46:16.865
"The first way is now better,
is equal to n over s times the",00:46:16.865,00:46:20.694
"Laplace transform of n minus t
to the n minus one.",00:46:20.694,00:46:24.787
"Okay, the next step,",00:46:24.787,00:46:27.097
"this would be n over s times n
minus one over s times the",00:46:27.097,00:46:30.794
"Laplace transform of t to the n
minus two.",00:46:30.794,00:46:34.887
"If I can continue,",00:46:34.887,00:46:38.679
"I finally get in the top n
times n minus one times all the",00:46:38.679,00:46:44.000
"way down to one divided by the
same number of s's,",00:46:44.000,00:46:48.573
"n of them, times the Laplace
transform of t to the zero,",00:46:48.573,00:46:53.706
"finally.
See, one, zero,",00:46:53.706,00:46:55.853
"n minus one.
And so, what's the final",00:46:55.853,00:46:59.213
"answer?
It is n factorial over s to the",00:46:59.213,00:47:02.760
"what power?
Well, the Laplace transform of",00:47:02.760,00:47:07.790
"this is one over s.
So, the answer is it's s to the",00:47:07.790,00:47:13.186
"n plus one,
n of them here plus an extra",00:47:13.186,00:47:18.116
"one coming from the one over s
here.",00:47:18.116,00:47:21.372
"And, that's the answer.
The Laplace transform of t to",00:47:21.372,00:47:26.210
"the n, oddly enough,",00:47:26.210,00:47:29.001
"is more complicated,
and looks a little different",00:47:29.001,00:47:33.466
"from these.
It's n factorial over s to the",00:47:33.466,00:47:37.280
n plus one.,00:47:37.280,00:47:40.164
"And, with that,
you can now calculate the",00:47:40.164,00:47:43.885
"Laplace transform of anything in
sight, and tomorrow you will.",00:47:43.885,00:47:47.951
