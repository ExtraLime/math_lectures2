"In this problem, we will be
helping Romeo and Juliet meet",00:00:00.250,00:00:02.310
up for a date.,00:00:02.310,00:00:03.420
"And in the process, also we'll
review some concepts in basic",00:00:03.420,00:00:06.450
"probability theory, including
sample spaces",00:00:06.450,00:00:09.950
and probability laws.,00:00:09.950,00:00:12.840
"This problem, the basic setup
is that Romeo and Juliet are",00:00:12.840,00:00:16.550
trying to meet up for a date.,00:00:16.550,00:00:18.040
"And let's say they're trying
to meet up for",00:00:18.040,00:00:19.510
lunch tomorrow at noon.,00:00:19.510,00:00:20.910
"But they're not necessarily
punctual.",00:00:20.910,00:00:22.610
"So they may arrive on time with
a delay of 0, or they may",00:00:22.610,00:00:27.840
"actually be up to 1 hour late
and arrive at 1:00 PM.",00:00:27.840,00:00:31.860
"So the other thing that we
assume in this problem is that",00:00:31.860,00:00:34.800
"all pairs of arrival times-- so
the time that Romeo arrives",00:00:34.800,00:00:38.380
"paired with the time they
Juliet arrives--",00:00:38.380,00:00:40.290
"all of these pairs are
equally likely.",00:00:40.290,00:00:43.090
"And I've put this in quotes,
because we haven't really",00:00:43.090,00:00:45.090
"specify exactly what
this means.",00:00:45.090,00:00:46.710
"And we'll come back to
that in a little bit.",00:00:46.710,00:00:49.450
"The last important thing is that
each person will wait for",00:00:49.450,00:00:52.320
"15 minutes for the other
person to arrive.",00:00:52.320,00:00:54.730
"If within that 15-minute
window the other person",00:00:54.730,00:00:56.780
"doesn't arrive, then they'll
give up and they'll end up not",00:00:56.780,00:01:00.660
meeting up for lunch.,00:01:00.660,00:01:02.480
"So to solve this problem, let's
first try to set up a",00:01:02.480,00:01:05.630
"sample space and come up with a
probability law to describe",00:01:05.630,00:01:09.550
this scenario.,00:01:09.550,00:01:12.370
"And let's actually start
with a simpler",00:01:12.370,00:01:15.350
version of this problem.,00:01:15.350,00:01:16.520
"And instead of assuming that
they can arrive at any delay",00:01:16.520,00:01:21.330
"between 0 and 1 hour, let's
pretend instead that Romeo and",00:01:21.330,00:01:25.510
"Juliet can only arrive in
15-minute increments.",00:01:25.510,00:01:29.000
"So Romeo can arrive on time
with a delay 0, or be 15",00:01:29.000,00:01:33.420
"minutes late, 30 minutes
late, 45 minutes",00:01:33.420,00:01:35.630
"late, or one hour late.",00:01:35.630,00:01:36.870
"But none of the other
times are possible.",00:01:36.870,00:01:39.630
And the same thing for Juliet.,00:01:39.630,00:01:40.880
 ,00:01:40.880,00:01:43.720
"Let's start out with just the
simple case first, because it",00:01:43.720,00:01:46.020
"helps us get the intuition for
the problem, and it's an",00:01:46.020,00:01:49.220
easier case to analyze.,00:01:49.220,00:01:50.470
 ,00:01:50.470,00:01:53.250
"So it's actually easy
to visualize this.",00:01:53.250,00:01:55.530
"It's a nice visual tool
to group this sample",00:01:55.530,00:01:58.760
space into a grid.,00:01:58.760,00:02:00.420
"So the horizontal axis here
represents the arrival time of",00:02:00.420,00:02:03.400
"Romeo, and the vertical
axis represents the",00:02:03.400,00:02:05.670
arrival time of Juliet.,00:02:05.670,00:02:07.870
"And so, for example, this point
here would represent",00:02:07.870,00:02:17.680
"Romeo arriving 15 minutes
late and Juliet",00:02:17.680,00:02:20.690
arriving 30 minutes late.,00:02:20.690,00:02:23.320
"So this is our sample
space now.",00:02:23.320,00:02:24.950
This is our omega.,00:02:24.950,00:02:28.270
"And now let's try to assign
a probability law.",00:02:28.270,00:02:31.180
"And we'll continue to assume
that all pairs of arrival",00:02:31.180,00:02:34.170
times are equally likely.,00:02:34.170,00:02:35.620
"And now we can actually
specifically specify what this",00:02:35.620,00:02:40.180
term means.,00:02:40.180,00:02:41.380
"And in particular, we'll be
invoking the discrete uniform",00:02:41.380,00:02:44.540
"law, which basically says that
all of these points, which are",00:02:44.540,00:02:48.390
"just outcomes in our
probabilistic experiment--",00:02:48.390,00:02:53.790
"all of these outcomes
are equally likely.",00:02:53.790,00:02:56.670
"And so since there are 25 of
them, each one of these",00:02:56.670,00:03:00.060
"outcomes has a probability
of 1 over 25.",00:03:00.060,00:03:03.860
"So now we've specified our
sample space and our",00:03:03.860,00:03:06.250
probability law.,00:03:06.250,00:03:07.440
"So now let's try to answer
the question, what is the",00:03:07.440,00:03:09.840
"probability that Romeo
and Juliet will meet",00:03:09.840,00:03:11.650
up for their date?,00:03:11.650,00:03:13.730
"So all that amounts to now is
just identifying which of",00:03:13.730,00:03:16.520
"these 25 outcomes results in
Romeo and Juliet arriving",00:03:16.520,00:03:21.820
"within 15 minutes
of each other.",00:03:21.820,00:03:23.860
"So let's start with this one
that I've picked out.",00:03:23.860,00:03:26.080
"If Romeo arrives 15 minutes
late and Juliet arrives 30",00:03:26.080,00:03:29.470
"minutes late, then they will
arrive within 15 minutes of",00:03:29.470,00:03:32.640
each other.,00:03:32.640,00:03:33.090
"So this outcome does result in
the two of them meeting.",00:03:33.090,00:03:38.370
"And so we can actually highlight
all of these.",00:03:38.370,00:03:42.840
"And it turns out that these
outcomes that I'm highlighting",00:03:42.840,00:03:55.170
"result in the two them arriving
within 15 minutes of",00:03:55.170,00:03:58.630
each other.,00:03:58.630,00:04:00.560
"So because each one has a
probability of 1 over 25, all",00:04:00.560,00:04:05.230
"we really need to do now
is just count how many",00:04:05.230,00:04:07.210
outcomes there are.,00:04:07.210,00:04:08.340
"So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.",00:04:08.340,00:04:16.230
"So the probability in the end
is for the discrete case.",00:04:16.230,00:04:21.640
The discrete case--,00:04:21.640,00:04:22.580
"I'm referring to the case where
we simplified it and",00:04:22.580,00:04:25.600
"considered only arrival times
with increments of 15 minutes.",00:04:25.600,00:04:28.880
"In this case, the probability
is 13 over 25.",00:04:28.880,00:04:36.300
"So now we have an idea of how
to solve this problem.",00:04:36.300,00:04:39.200
"It amounts to basically coming
up with a sample space, a",00:04:39.200,00:04:42.340
"probability law, and then
identifying the events of",00:04:42.340,00:04:45.010
"interest in calculating the
probability of that event.",00:04:45.010,00:04:47.820
"So now let's actually solve the
problem that we really are",00:04:47.820,00:04:51.590
"interested in, which is that
instead of confining Romeo and",00:04:51.590,00:04:57.420
"Juliet to arrive in only
15-minute minute increments,",00:04:57.420,00:04:59.830
"really, time is continuous,
and Romeo and Juliet can",00:04:59.830,00:05:01.860
arrive at any time.,00:05:01.860,00:05:02.940
"So they don't necessarily have
to arrive 15 minutes late.",00:05:02.940,00:05:05.900
"Romeo could arrive 15 minutes
and 37 seconds late",00:05:05.900,00:05:09.470
if he wanted to.,00:05:09.470,00:05:11.830
"So now our new sample space is
actually just, instead of only",00:05:11.830,00:05:15.350
"these 25 points in the grid,
it's this entire square.",00:05:15.350,00:05:19.610
"So any point within the square
could be a possible pair of",00:05:19.610,00:05:22.700
"meeting times between
Romeo and Juliet.",00:05:22.700,00:05:26.710
"So that is our new sample
space, our new omega.",00:05:26.710,00:05:29.740
"And now let's assign a
new probability law.",00:05:29.740,00:05:32.280
"And now, instead of being in the
discrete world, we're in",00:05:32.280,00:05:34.840
the continuous world.,00:05:34.840,00:05:36.050
"And the analogy here
is to consider",00:05:36.050,00:05:38.740
probabilities as areas.,00:05:38.740,00:05:40.910
"So the area of this entire
square is one.",00:05:40.910,00:05:43.970
"And that also corresponds to the
probability of omega, the",00:05:43.970,00:05:46.950
sample space.,00:05:46.950,00:05:48.170
"And imagine just spreading
probability evenly across this",00:05:48.170,00:05:52.370
"square so that the probability
of any event--",00:05:52.370,00:05:55.230
"which in this case
would just be any",00:05:55.230,00:05:56.440
shape within this square--,00:05:56.440,00:05:58.190
"is exactly equal to the
area of that shape.",00:05:58.190,00:06:02.760
"So now that is our new
sample space and our",00:06:02.760,00:06:05.090
new probability law.,00:06:05.090,00:06:06.460
"So what we have to do now is
just to identify the event of",00:06:06.460,00:06:08.850
"interest, which is still the
event that Romeo and Juliet",00:06:08.850,00:06:12.160
"arrive within 15 minutes
of each other.",00:06:12.160,00:06:14.810
So let's do that.,00:06:14.810,00:06:17.130
"If Romeo and Juliet arrive both
on time, then obviously",00:06:17.130,00:06:19.840
they'll meet.,00:06:19.840,00:06:20.790
"And if Romeo's on time and
Juliet is 15 minutes late,",00:06:20.790,00:06:24.130
then they will still meet.,00:06:24.130,00:06:25.520
"And in fact, any pairs of
meeting times between these",00:06:25.520,00:06:31.110
"would still work, because now
Romeo can be on time, and",00:06:31.110,00:06:34.190
"Juliet can arrive at any time
between 0 and 15 minutes late.",00:06:34.190,00:06:37.790
"But you notice that if Juliet is
even a tiny bit later than",00:06:37.790,00:06:43.870
"15 minutes, then they won't
end up meeting.",00:06:43.870,00:06:46.460
"So this segment here is part
of the event of interest.",00:06:46.460,00:06:50.970
"And similarly, this
segment here is",00:06:50.970,00:06:54.720
also part of the event.,00:06:54.720,00:06:56.560
"And if you take this exercise
and extend it, you can",00:06:56.560,00:06:59.230
"actually verify that the event
of interest is this strip",00:06:59.230,00:07:07.040
"shape in the middle
of the square.",00:07:07.040,00:07:11.640
"Which, if you think about it,
makes sense, because you want",00:07:11.640,00:07:14.180
"the arrival times between Romeo
and Juliet to be close",00:07:14.180,00:07:17.470
"to each other, so you would be
expect it to be somewhere",00:07:17.470,00:07:21.050
"close to a diagonal
in this square.",00:07:21.050,00:07:25.080
"So now we have our event
of interest.",00:07:25.080,00:07:27.190
"We have our sample space and
our probability law.",00:07:27.190,00:07:28.980
"So all we have to do now is
just calculate what this",00:07:28.980,00:07:31.550
probability is.,00:07:31.550,00:07:33.010
"And we've already said that
the probability in this",00:07:33.010,00:07:36.110
probability law is just areas.,00:07:36.110,00:07:38.930
"So now it actually just boils
down to not a probability",00:07:38.930,00:07:41.980
"problem, but a problem
in geometry.",00:07:41.980,00:07:44.390
"So to calculate this area, you
can do it in lots of ways.",00:07:44.390,00:07:47.740
"One way is to calculate the area
of the square, which is",00:07:47.740,00:07:51.110
"1, and subtract the areas
of these two triangles.",00:07:51.110,00:07:55.520
So let's do that.,00:07:55.520,00:07:58.600
"So in the continuous case, the
probability of meeting is",00:07:58.600,00:08:00.980
"going to be 1 minus the
area of this triangle.",00:08:00.980,00:08:04.620
"The base here is 3/4 and
3/4, so it's 1/2",00:08:04.620,00:08:10.320
times 3/4 times 3/4.,00:08:10.320,00:08:13.810
"That's the area of one
of these triangles.",00:08:13.810,00:08:15.340
"There's two of them, so
we'll multiply by two.",00:08:15.340,00:08:17.830
"And we end up with 1
minus 9/16, or 7/16",00:08:17.830,00:08:26.200
as our final answer.,00:08:26.200,00:08:29.250
"So in this problem, we've
reviewed some basic concepts",00:08:29.250,00:08:33.490
"of probability, and that's
also helped us solve this",00:08:33.490,00:08:36.360
"problem of helping Romeo and
Juliet meet up for a date.",00:08:36.360,00:08:39.100
"And if you wanted to, you could
even extend this problem",00:08:39.100,00:08:41.320
"even further and turn
it on its head.",00:08:41.320,00:08:44.130
"And instead of calculating given
that they arrive within",00:08:44.130,00:08:47.090
"15 minutes of each other, what
is the probability that",00:08:47.090,00:08:49.070
"they'll meet, let's say that
Romeo really wants to meet up",00:08:49.070,00:08:51.730
"with Juliet, and he wants to
assure himself a least, say, a",00:08:51.730,00:08:56.895
90% chance of meeting Juliet.,00:08:56.895,00:08:58.800
"Then you can ask, if he wants to
have at least a 90% chance",00:08:58.800,00:09:02.550
"of meeting her, how long should
he be willing to wait?",00:09:02.550,00:09:05.630
"And so that's the flip
side of the problem.",00:09:05.630,00:09:08.990
"And you can see that with just
some basic concepts of",00:09:08.990,00:09:11.860
"probability, you can answer
some already pretty",00:09:11.860,00:09:13.800
interesting problems.,00:09:13.800,00:09:16.060
"So I hope this problem was
interesting, and we'll",00:09:16.060,00:09:18.310
see you next time.,00:09:18.310,00:09:19.560
