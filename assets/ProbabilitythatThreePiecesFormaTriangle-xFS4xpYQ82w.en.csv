"In this problem, we're going
to look at the probability",00:00:01.770,00:00:03.900
"that when you take a stick and
break it into three pieces",00:00:03.900,00:00:07.090
"randomly that these three pieces
can actually be used to",00:00:07.090,00:00:10.300
form a triangle.,00:00:10.300,00:00:12.560
"All right, so we start
out with a stick of",00:00:12.560,00:00:16.300
"unit length, so--",00:00:16.300,00:00:18.010
length 1.,00:00:18.010,00:00:19.680
"And we'll choose a point along
the stick to break.",00:00:19.680,00:00:25.580
"And we'll choose that point
uniformly at random.",00:00:25.580,00:00:28.540
"So let's say that we chose it
here, that was the point where",00:00:28.540,00:00:31.565
we'll break it.,00:00:31.565,00:00:33.380
"And then independently of this
first choice we'll again",00:00:33.380,00:00:37.180
"choose a second point
to break it.",00:00:37.180,00:00:39.970
"Again, uniformly at random
along the entire stick.",00:00:39.970,00:00:43.000
"So let's say the second point
we chose was here.",00:00:43.000,00:00:47.780
"So what we have now is, we'll
break it here, here, and so",00:00:47.780,00:00:50.560
we'll have three pieces--,00:00:50.560,00:00:51.610
"the first one, the left
one and the right one.",00:00:51.610,00:00:54.310
"And we want to know, what's the
probability that when you",00:00:54.310,00:00:56.730
"take these three pieces you
could form a triangle?",00:00:56.730,00:01:00.810
"So the first thing we
should ask ourselves",00:01:00.810,00:01:02.110
"is, what do you need--",00:01:02.110,00:01:04.200
"what conditions must be
satisfied in order to actually",00:01:04.200,00:01:07.050
"be able to form a triangle
with three pieces?",00:01:07.050,00:01:09.790
"So you could think about, what
would stop you from being able",00:01:09.790,00:01:13.070
to do that?,00:01:13.070,00:01:14.110
"Well, one possibility is
that you have pieces",00:01:14.110,00:01:18.130
that look like this.,00:01:18.130,00:01:19.380
 ,00:01:19.380,00:01:22.990
"So in that case you would
try to form something",00:01:22.990,00:01:27.910
that looks like this.,00:01:27.910,00:01:32.540
"But you can't get a triangle
because these two pieces are",00:01:32.540,00:01:35.800
"too short and they can't
touch each other.",00:01:35.800,00:01:37.990
"So actually the condition that
must be satisfied is that when",00:01:37.990,00:01:42.220
"you take any two of the three
pieces, their combined length",00:01:42.220,00:01:48.490
"has to be greater than
the length of the",00:01:48.490,00:01:50.430
remaining third piece.,00:01:50.430,00:01:52.200
"And that has to be true
for any two pieces.",00:01:52.200,00:01:53.900
 ,00:01:53.900,00:01:56.500
"And really that's just so that
any two pieces, they can touch",00:01:56.500,00:02:01.590
and still form a triangle.,00:02:01.590,00:02:04.970
"So let's try to add some
probability to this.",00:02:04.970,00:02:08.870
"So we have a unit
length stick.",00:02:08.870,00:02:13.440
"So let's actually give
a coordinate system.",00:02:13.440,00:02:17.510
The stick goes from 0 to 1.,00:02:17.510,00:02:20.430
"And let's say that we break
it at these two points.",00:02:20.430,00:02:23.120
 ,00:02:23.120,00:02:30.790
"So the first point where we
choose, we'll call that x.",00:02:30.790,00:02:38.090
"So that's the first point that
we choose to break it.",00:02:38.090,00:02:40.990
"And then the second point we
choose, we'll call that y.",00:02:40.990,00:02:44.670
"Now note that I've drawn it so
that x is to the left of y.",00:02:44.670,00:02:50.700
"But it could actually be the
case that the first point I",00:02:50.700,00:02:53.760
"chose is here and the
second point that I",00:02:53.760,00:02:55.860
chose is to the left.,00:02:55.860,00:02:57.680
"But for now, let's
first assume that",00:02:57.680,00:03:05.840
this scenario holds.,00:03:05.840,00:03:07.640
"That the first point is to the
left of the second point.",00:03:07.640,00:03:12.850
"So under this assumption,
we can see that--",00:03:12.850,00:03:18.930
"from the definition of these
random variables-- we can",00:03:18.930,00:03:21.370
"actually see that the
lengths are given",00:03:21.370,00:03:24.640
by these three lengths.,00:03:24.640,00:03:26.560
 ,00:03:26.560,00:03:29.620
"So the lengths are x, the left
most piece has length x.",00:03:29.620,00:03:36.210
"The second, middle piece
has length y minus x.",00:03:36.210,00:03:41.840
"And the last piece has
length 1 minus y.",00:03:41.840,00:03:44.618
 ,00:03:44.618,00:03:48.420
"And now let's recall our
three conditions.",00:03:48.420,00:03:54.270
"So the conditions were that any
two of these, the sum of",00:03:54.270,00:03:59.420
"any two lengths, has
to be at least--",00:03:59.420,00:04:01.070
"has to be greater than the
length of the third piece.",00:04:01.070,00:04:04.840
So let's do these together.,00:04:04.840,00:04:07.690
"So x plus y minus x has to be
greater than 1 minus y.",00:04:07.690,00:04:15.700
"So with these two pieces you
can cover this third piece.",00:04:15.700,00:04:21.329
"We also need that with the first
and third pieces, we can",00:04:21.329,00:04:28.450
cover the middle piece.,00:04:28.450,00:04:31.910
"And we need with the second and
third pieces, we can cover",00:04:31.910,00:04:41.460
the first piece.,00:04:41.460,00:04:43.870
"Now this looks kind of messy,
but in fact we can actually",00:04:43.870,00:04:46.140
simplify this.,00:04:46.140,00:04:48.260
So this actually simplifies.,00:04:48.260,00:04:50.500
"x minus x, that disappears.",00:04:50.500,00:04:52.790
"And so this actually simplifies
to 2y has",00:04:52.790,00:04:57.550
to be at least 1.,00:04:57.550,00:04:58.530
"Or even more simply, y has
to be greater than 1/2.",00:04:58.530,00:05:02.645
 ,00:05:02.645,00:05:05.500
What about this one?,00:05:05.500,00:05:07.510
"This one, we can rearrange
things again.",00:05:07.510,00:05:11.190
x we can move over.,00:05:11.190,00:05:12.460
y we can move over here.,00:05:12.460,00:05:13.870
"And we get that 2x plus 1 has
to be greater than 2y.",00:05:13.870,00:05:18.680
"Or put in other words, y is
less than x plus 1/2.",00:05:18.680,00:05:26.465
 ,00:05:26.465,00:05:29.140
"And for the last one, again
we can simplify.",00:05:29.140,00:05:32.420
The y's cancel each other out.,00:05:32.420,00:05:34.020
"And we're left with
2x is less than 1.",00:05:34.020,00:05:36.870
 ,00:05:36.870,00:05:39.590
Or x is less than 1/2.,00:05:39.590,00:05:41.980
 ,00:05:41.980,00:05:44.900
"So these are our three
conditions",00:05:44.900,00:05:48.430
that need to be satisfied.,00:05:48.430,00:05:50.400
"So now we just have to figure
out what's the probability",00:05:50.400,00:05:52.640
"that this is actually
satisfied?",00:05:52.640,00:05:55.180
"Now let's go back to original
definition and see what are",00:05:55.180,00:06:06.030
"the actual distributions
for these random",00:06:06.030,00:06:07.740
"variables, x and y.",00:06:07.740,00:06:08.660
"Remember, we defined them to
be x is the location of the",00:06:08.660,00:06:12.370
"first break and y is the
location of the second break.",00:06:12.370,00:06:16.390
"And as we said in the problem,
these are chosen uniformly at",00:06:16.390,00:06:20.000
"random and they're
independent.",00:06:20.000,00:06:23.010
"And so we can actually draw
out their joint PDF.",00:06:23.010,00:06:28.740
"So x and y, you can cover
any point in the square.",00:06:28.740,00:06:34.740
"And moreover, it's actually
uniform within the square.",00:06:34.740,00:06:42.200
"Because each one is chosen
uniformly at random and",00:06:42.200,00:06:46.200
they're independent.,00:06:46.200,00:06:47.830
So it's anywhere in here.,00:06:47.830,00:06:51.240
And so what do we need to do?,00:06:51.240,00:06:53.770
"We just need to identify, what
is the probability that these",00:06:53.770,00:06:56.540
three conditions hold?,00:06:56.540,00:06:57.790
 ,00:06:57.790,00:07:03.800
"Rewrite this, line these up.",00:07:03.800,00:07:08.600
"So these are our three
conditions that we need.",00:07:08.600,00:07:13.980
"And now remember, we're still
working under the assumption",00:07:13.980,00:07:16.250
"that the first point that we
chose is actually to the left",00:07:16.250,00:07:19.900
of the second point.,00:07:19.900,00:07:21.630
So what does that mean?,00:07:21.630,00:07:24.440
"That means that we are
actually in this top",00:07:24.440,00:07:27.920
"triangle, top half--",00:07:27.920,00:07:30.100
x is less than y.,00:07:30.100,00:07:33.000
"All right, so what do we need?",00:07:33.000,00:07:35.540
"We need y to be at least
1/2, so here's 1/2.",00:07:35.540,00:07:38.910
"So we need y to be
above this line.",00:07:38.910,00:07:41.990
We need x to be less than 1/2.,00:07:41.990,00:07:43.780
"So we need x to be to
the left of here.",00:07:43.780,00:07:47.270
"So now so far we're stuck
in this upper square.",00:07:47.270,00:07:51.640
"And the last thing we need is y
to be less than x plus 1/2.",00:07:51.640,00:07:55.070
What is y?,00:07:55.070,00:07:56.420
"The line y equals x and a 1/2,
x plus 1/2, is this one.",00:07:56.420,00:08:02.310
"So y has to be less than that,
so it would have to be in this",00:08:02.310,00:08:06.880
triangle here.,00:08:06.880,00:08:08.360
"So these three conditions tell
us that in order for us to",00:08:08.360,00:08:11.670
"have a triangle we need to for
x and y to fall jointly in",00:08:11.670,00:08:17.330
this small triangle here.,00:08:17.330,00:08:19.710
"Now because the joint
distribution is uniform, we",00:08:19.710,00:08:24.190
"know that the density
is just 1, right?",00:08:24.190,00:08:26.450
"Because the area
here is just 1.",00:08:26.450,00:08:30.150
"So the height is
just 1 as well.",00:08:30.150,00:08:32.600
"And so the density, or the
probability of falling within",00:08:32.600,00:08:36.809
"this small triangle, is just
going to be also the area of",00:08:36.809,00:08:41.020
this triangle.,00:08:41.020,00:08:41.840
"And what is the area
of this triangle?",00:08:41.840,00:08:44.900
"Well, you can fit 8 of these
triangles in here, or you",00:08:44.900,00:08:48.090
"could think of it as 1/2
times 1/2 times 1/2.",00:08:48.090,00:08:50.580
So the area is just 1/8.,00:08:50.580,00:08:54.450
"So assuming that x is less than
y, then the probability",00:08:54.450,00:09:00.565
of forming a triangle is 1/8.,00:09:00.565,00:09:04.900
"Now, that's only half
this story, though.",00:09:04.900,00:09:06.910
"Because it's possible that when
you chose these two break",00:09:06.910,00:09:10.580
"points that we actually had
the opposite result.",00:09:10.580,00:09:16.930
"That x, the point that you
chose first, falls to the",00:09:16.930,00:09:21.900
"right of the point that
you chose second.",00:09:21.900,00:09:24.630
"In which case everything
kind of flips.",00:09:24.630,00:09:28.120
"Now we assume that y is less
than x, which means that now",00:09:28.120,00:09:34.040
"we're in this lower triangle
in the square.",00:09:34.040,00:09:38.760
"Now we can go through this
whole exercise again.",00:09:38.760,00:09:41.140
"But really, what we can see is
that all we've really done is",00:09:41.140,00:09:44.560
just swap the names.,00:09:44.560,00:09:47.770
"Instead of having x and y we now
call x-- we call x y and",00:09:47.770,00:09:53.520
we call y x.,00:09:53.520,00:09:55.330
"And so if we just swap names,
we can see that--",00:09:55.330,00:09:59.930
"let's just fast forward through
all these steps and",00:09:59.930,00:10:01.870
"see that we could just swap
names here, too, as well, in",00:10:01.870,00:10:04.590
the three conditions.,00:10:04.590,00:10:05.210
"So instead of needing y to be
greater than 1/2, we just need",00:10:05.210,00:10:09.260
x to be greater than 1/2.,00:10:09.260,00:10:11.990
"Instead of having x less than
1/2, we need y less than 1/2.",00:10:11.990,00:10:15.620
We also swap this.,00:10:15.620,00:10:18.220
"So we need x to be less than y
plus 1/2 or y is greater than",00:10:18.220,00:10:25.300
x minus 1/2.,00:10:25.300,00:10:28.430
"All right, now let's figure out
what this corresponds to.",00:10:28.430,00:10:33.130
"We need x to be greater than
1/2, so it needs to be to the",00:10:33.130,00:10:36.660
right of here.,00:10:36.660,00:10:37.850
"We need y to be less than
1/2, so we need it to",00:10:37.850,00:10:40.530
be below this line.,00:10:40.530,00:10:42.710
"And we need y to be greater
than x minus 1/2.",00:10:42.710,00:10:46.800
"What is the line y equals
x minus 1/2?",00:10:46.800,00:10:50.570
That is this line here.,00:10:50.570,00:10:53.710
"And we need y to be greater than
that, so it needs to be",00:10:53.710,00:10:56.330
above this line.,00:10:56.330,00:10:57.510
"And so we get that this is the
triangle, the small triangle",00:10:57.510,00:11:02.930
that we need in this case.,00:11:02.930,00:11:05.230
"And notice that it's exactly
the same area",00:11:05.230,00:11:08.960
"as this one, right?",00:11:08.960,00:11:10.480
"And so we get another
contribution of 1/8 here.",00:11:10.480,00:11:13.320
"So the final answer is
1/8 plus 1/8 is 1/4.",00:11:13.320,00:11:19.490
"So the probability of forming
a triangle using this three",00:11:19.490,00:11:23.430
pieces is exactly 1/4.,00:11:23.430,00:11:26.270
"And so notice that we've done
is, you've set things up very",00:11:26.270,00:11:31.250
"methodically in the beginning
by assigning",00:11:31.250,00:11:33.660
these random variables.,00:11:33.660,00:11:34.550
"And you consider different
cases.",00:11:34.550,00:11:37.540
"Because you don't actually know
the order in which x and",00:11:37.540,00:11:41.020
"y might fall, let's just assume
that one particular",00:11:41.020,00:11:44.630
order and work from there.,00:11:44.630,00:11:46.190
"And then do the other
case, as well.",00:11:46.190,00:11:48.550
"And it just so happened that
because of the symmetry of the",00:11:48.550,00:11:52.770
"problem the second case was
actually very simple.",00:11:52.770,00:11:55.570
