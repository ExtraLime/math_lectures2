"PROFESSOR: Now
generally speaking,",00:00:22.874,00:00:24.290
"a proof is going to have
seven characteristics",00:00:24.290,00:00:28.226
that you want to keep in mind.,00:00:28.226,00:00:29.650
"Good proofs are correct--
that's obviously important--",00:00:33.950,00:00:41.470
"complete-- you've got to
have all the details there.",00:00:41.470,00:00:46.930
"All of the key steps
have to be there.",00:00:46.930,00:00:50.680
"They should be clear so we can
understand what's going on.",00:00:50.680,00:00:54.580
Brief is good.,00:00:58.070,00:01:00.300
"You don't want to crush
somebody with all the details.",00:01:00.300,00:01:03.630
"You want to get to the
key points, and be crisp.",00:01:03.630,00:01:08.570
"It's really nice
if they're elegant.",00:01:08.570,00:01:10.330
"Now, that means clever.",00:01:13.730,00:01:16.320
"It's the mathematician's
notion of beauty.",00:01:16.320,00:01:19.397
"Like you go to the art museum,
and the artists will say,",00:01:19.397,00:01:21.730
"wow, that's a
beautiful painting.",00:01:21.730,00:01:24.210
"In mathematics, you say,
wow, that's an elegant proof.",00:01:24.210,00:01:28.160
"It's crisp, clever,
short, to the point.",00:01:28.160,00:01:31.410
"And it's really the
highest compliment",00:01:31.410,00:01:33.040
"you can get from a
mathematician, anyway.",00:01:33.040,00:01:36.770
"And there's a lot of
judgment that goes into that.",00:01:36.770,00:01:40.882
"Just like in art--
there's judgment",00:01:40.882,00:01:42.340
over what is great art.,00:01:42.340,00:01:44.382
"The proof should
be well organized.",00:01:44.382,00:01:45.840
"For example, use
lemmas the same way",00:01:50.690,00:01:52.950
"you would use
subroutines in writing",00:01:52.950,00:01:54.500
code-- helps to make it clear.,00:01:54.500,00:01:58.400
"And the proof
should be in order.",00:01:58.400,00:02:00.105
"Sometimes you'll see
proofs where things are",00:02:03.150,00:02:05.030
done in a haphazard fashion.,00:02:05.030,00:02:06.950
"All the pieces are there, but
they're in the wrong order.",00:02:06.950,00:02:09.810
"Sometimes-- and they teach
this in some high schools--",00:02:09.810,00:02:13.120
"they teach you to
do proofs backwards.",00:02:13.120,00:02:16.790
"And the classic thing
there is, say you're",00:02:16.790,00:02:18.850
trying to prove a equals b.,00:02:18.850,00:02:21.600
"Well, the proof sometimes
will start with what",00:02:21.600,00:02:23.530
you're trying to prove.,00:02:23.530,00:02:25.080
"And then they'll do
a bunch of steps.",00:02:25.080,00:02:27.200
"And then you'll end
up with 1 equals 1,",00:02:27.200,00:02:29.270
"and you'll write a
check, because you went",00:02:29.270,00:02:32.900
from a equals b to 1 equals 1.,00:02:32.900,00:02:35.440
"And that's, of course, true.",00:02:35.440,00:02:37.510
"Now, that's not a
good thing to do.",00:02:37.510,00:02:40.250
"It can be correct if the
implications go this way.",00:02:40.250,00:02:45.400
"Because really, you're starting
with a fact-- 1 equals 1--",00:02:45.400,00:02:49.520
and deriving a equals b.,00:02:49.520,00:02:51.160
"So if, in fact, the
implications work this way,",00:02:51.160,00:02:54.000
then your proof is right.,00:02:54.000,00:02:55.720
"But most people, especially
as you get farther along,",00:02:55.720,00:02:58.930
"think about it going
from top to bottom.",00:02:58.930,00:03:02.470
"So don't use this technique,
because it'll confuse people.",00:03:02.470,00:03:06.330
You're liable to make a mistake.,00:03:06.330,00:03:07.940
"Just start with 1 equals 1
and work your way from there--",00:03:07.940,00:03:10.790
top down for being in order.,00:03:10.790,00:03:13.210
"Now, good proofs are
very much like good code.",00:03:16.140,00:03:21.090
"In fact, one of the reasons we
care so much about teaching you",00:03:21.090,00:03:23.750
"how to write a good
proof in computer science",00:03:23.750,00:03:26.990
"is so that later on,
you'll be able to prove",00:03:26.990,00:03:30.180
"that your programs are doing
what you expect-- what they're",00:03:30.180,00:03:33.550
supposed to do.,00:03:33.550,00:03:35.680
"Now, there are many famous
examples where programs did not",00:03:35.680,00:03:39.325
"do what they were
supposed to do,",00:03:39.325,00:03:40.700

"It could take off, fly, and
land totally by software.",00:03:49.720,00:03:54.140
"It was a major advance
in the airline industry.",00:03:54.140,00:03:57.600

was, that on one",00:03:57.600,00:03:59.110
"of the first
flights of the A300,",00:03:59.110,00:04:01.140

before landing.,00:04:05.240,00:04:06.580
"And the plane
crashed as a result.",00:04:06.580,00:04:08.940
"It was the first plane crash
in commercial history because",00:04:08.940,00:04:11.740
of a software bug.,00:04:11.740,00:04:14.130

called the Therac-25.,00:04:17.589,00:04:19.970
"It's famous because it
got into a race condition",00:04:19.970,00:04:23.350
"occasionally, which
caused the device",00:04:23.350,00:04:26.070
"to just slam the patient
with radiation-- so much so,",00:04:26.070,00:04:29.310
it killed the patient.,00:04:29.310,00:04:30.700
"And they had multiple examples
of this, and of course,",00:04:30.700,00:04:32.960
a lot of lawsuits afterwards.,00:04:32.960,00:04:35.490
"How many of you all
remember the 2000 election?",00:04:35.490,00:04:39.764
A few of you do.,00:04:39.764,00:04:40.430
"OK, this will probably be the
last class that remembers that.",00:04:40.430,00:04:44.320
"But that's where Al Gore was
going up against George Bush--",00:04:44.320,00:04:47.030
"very close election-- all
came down to recounting",00:04:47.030,00:04:49.930
the votes in Florida.,00:04:49.930,00:04:52.060
"But in fact, Al Gore got

of a software bug",00:04:56.370,00:04:59.590

"I think they got rid of a
lot of them in the election",00:05:02.150,00:05:04.501
after that.,00:05:04.501,00:05:05.000
Because the software was buggy.,00:05:05.000,00:05:07.010
"So poor Al had enough
problem which chads",00:05:07.010,00:05:08.840
and funny business in Florida.,00:05:08.840,00:05:10.090
"But getting negative
16,000 votes certainly",00:05:10.090,00:05:12.580
didn't help his chances.,00:05:12.580,00:05:14.890
"Several years ago, a
single faulty command",00:05:14.890,00:05:17.820

all the time at Akamai.",00:05:33.400,00:05:36.790

undergrads in the late 1990s.",00:05:40.760,00:05:44.850

"A lot of the stuff you go
to comes from our servers.",00:05:51.850,00:05:54.790
"So we've got to be
very careful that we",00:05:54.790,00:05:56.710
don't have software bugs.,00:05:56.710,00:05:58.039
"Now, in fact we do.",00:05:58.039,00:05:58.830
"And we catch them
every once in awhile.",00:05:58.830,00:06:00.710
"But if we got a bad
one, it would bring down",00:06:00.710,00:06:02.594
all the sites you go to you.,00:06:02.594,00:06:03.760
"You wouldn't be able to
go to those sites anymore.",00:06:03.760,00:06:05.855
And everybody would notice.,00:06:05.855,00:06:06.980
"It would be sort
of embarrassing.",00:06:06.980,00:06:08.355
"Now, this really does matter.",00:06:10.740,00:06:14.680
"And this is going to sound a
little scary, but someday--",00:06:14.680,00:06:18.380
"probably 30, 20 years
from now, somewhere",00:06:18.380,00:06:20.620
"in there-- it's possible
that all of us, our lives",00:06:20.620,00:06:25.080
"may depend on the software
that some of you write.",00:06:25.080,00:06:29.490
"In fact, to bring this
home how scary it is,",00:06:29.490,00:06:32.010
"look at the person
sitting next to you.",00:06:32.010,00:06:34.550

"someday, or puts him in
a bad plane situation.",00:06:58.290,00:07:03.040
"Now unfortunately,
writing rock-solid proofs",00:07:03.040,00:07:07.100
is a very hard thing to do.,00:07:07.100,00:07:08.910
"Even the world's
best mathematicians",00:07:08.910,00:07:11.380
mess them up on a regular basis.,00:07:11.380,00:07:13.550

third of all published proofs",00:07:13.550,00:07:18.570

details or all the steps.",00:07:28.040,00:07:30.570

Let's just move on.,00:07:32.880,00:07:35.740
"Now, this can be OK.",00:07:35.740,00:07:39.330
"Not such a good practice,
but it dramatically",00:07:39.330,00:07:42.010
"increases the chances
of making a mistake.",00:07:42.010,00:07:45.100

very famous examples",00:07:45.100,00:07:46.650
"in the math literature
from the world's",00:07:46.650,00:07:48.274
most famous mathematicians.,00:07:48.274,00:07:50.320

talk about Gauss",00:07:50.320,00:07:51.837
"later during the term--
he's one of the most",00:07:51.837,00:07:53.670
famous mathematicians ever.,00:07:53.670,00:07:55.420
He wrote his PhD thesis in 1799.,00:07:55.420,00:07:59.640
"And it's usually referred to
as the first rigorous proof",00:07:59.640,00:08:03.440
"of the fundamental
theorem of algebra.",00:08:03.440,00:08:05.350
"And that says that
every polynomial",00:08:05.350,00:08:08.130
"has a 0 over the complex
numbers-- something",00:08:08.130,00:08:10.410
"probably a lot of you
learned in high school.",00:08:10.410,00:08:12.325
You get a polynomial.,00:08:12.325,00:08:13.200
"You can find roots
of the polynomial",00:08:13.200,00:08:14.700
over the complex numbers.,00:08:14.700,00:08:17.100

writing that down,",00:08:49.530,00:08:50.946

it was a simple fact.",00:09:17.210,00:09:22.440
"Four years later, he
decided it wasn't so simple,",00:09:22.440,00:09:25.790

or position.,00:21:37.530,00:21:38.106
"Now, to prove this,
we're going to use",00:21:49.400,00:21:53.790
what's called an invariant.,00:21:53.790,00:21:56.530
"It's a very powerful
and commonly used",00:21:56.530,00:21:58.910
"concept in computer science,
very closely tied to induction,",00:21:58.910,00:22:02.470
as we'll see.,00:22:02.470,00:22:04.500
"In order to show that
your system can never",00:22:04.500,00:22:07.800
"reach a particular
special state,",00:22:07.800,00:22:11.580
"it is sufficient to show
there's some property called",00:22:11.580,00:22:13.900
"the invariant that holds
at the initial state,",00:22:13.900,00:22:17.880
"and that is preserved
by every legal move,",00:22:17.880,00:22:21.540
"and is not present-- does not
hold-- in that special state.",00:22:21.540,00:22:26.770
"The idea is, if you get
this magic property called",00:22:26.770,00:22:29.230
"the invariant and it
holds at the start,",00:22:29.230,00:22:31.540
"and it holds across
every step, then",00:22:31.540,00:22:34.150
"the only states
you can reach have",00:22:34.150,00:22:36.640
"to have to have the
property, be invariant.",00:22:36.640,00:22:39.450
"And if the special state
doesn't have that property,",00:22:39.450,00:22:42.850
you can't reach it.,00:22:42.850,00:22:45.060
"All right, so there
is going to be",00:22:45.060,00:22:47.970
"some property we're going
to look for that held",00:22:47.970,00:22:50.130
"at the beginning here-- and
the beginning had this set",00:22:50.130,00:22:53.110
"up-- that holds, is
preserved, by every move,",00:22:53.110,00:22:59.420
"every legal move, but does
not hold in this state.",00:22:59.420,00:23:03.800
"And therefore, you can never
reach this state legally.",00:23:03.800,00:23:06.527
So they were doomed.,00:23:06.527,00:23:07.360
"So we've got to figure
out what that property is.",00:23:09.880,00:23:12.710
"And that's always the
trick in analyzing",00:23:15.240,00:23:17.730
"systems or
algorithms-- is what's",00:23:17.730,00:23:19.790
"that key property, the
invariant property?",00:23:19.790,00:23:22.930
"So to figure out the
invariant, we sort of",00:23:22.930,00:23:24.680
"have to look at what
happens during a move",00:23:24.680,00:23:27.700
in this system-- a transition.,00:23:27.700,00:23:30.080
"Well, there's two
kinds of moves.",00:23:30.080,00:23:33.130
There's a row move.,00:23:33.130,00:23:34.080
"And an example of a
row move is you might",00:23:37.860,00:23:45.590
"have a, b, c, d, g, e, f, h.",00:23:45.590,00:23:53.560
"And I'm going to move the g
its row to the blank square.",00:23:53.560,00:23:57.810
So it would become this state.,00:23:57.810,00:23:59.812
"So g moves rightward
into the blank,",00:24:05.010,00:24:07.720
and the rest stays the same.,00:24:07.720,00:24:11.020
"Now, when I make a row
move, did the relative order",00:24:11.020,00:24:16.150
of the items change?,00:24:16.150,00:24:18.135
No.,00:24:21.060,00:24:21.624
"Of course, to be
precise, I better",00:24:21.624,00:24:23.040
"define what relative order
means, or the natural order.",00:24:23.040,00:24:27.280
"So by the natural order, I mean
this ordering-- 1, 2 3, 4, 5,",00:24:27.280,00:24:39.210
"6, 7, 8, 9.",00:24:39.210,00:24:42.100
"So if I look at the order
here, g moved from 5 to 6,",00:24:42.100,00:24:47.070
"but didn't change
order with respect",00:24:47.070,00:24:49.090
to any of the other guys.,00:24:49.090,00:24:50.150
Let's state that as a lemma.,00:24:52.874,00:24:54.040
Because that'll be very useful.,00:25:02.780,00:25:05.490
"Lemma 1-- a row move
does not change the order",00:25:05.490,00:25:21.920
of the items or the letters.,00:25:21.920,00:25:24.940
"Proof-- well, it's obvious.",00:25:29.480,00:25:33.590
"No, you can't let me get
away with that, right?",00:25:39.540,00:25:41.640
"Because I'm not to let you get
away with that on homework.",00:25:41.640,00:25:44.490
That's not so good.,00:25:44.490,00:25:47.120
"So we've got to be a little
more careful in the proof here.",00:25:47.120,00:25:51.140
"Otherwise, we just head
down the path to trouble.",00:25:51.140,00:25:54.580
"So let's sort of specify,
what does a row move",00:25:54.580,00:25:57.520
"mean-- just get a little bit
of math and specification",00:25:57.520,00:26:03.450
around it.,00:26:03.450,00:26:05.140
"Well, in a row move,
we move an item--",00:26:05.140,00:26:13.720
"a letter-- from some
cell i, whatever",00:26:13.720,00:26:23.680
"i-- it could be anything 1
to 9-- into an adjacent cell.",00:26:23.680,00:26:30.170
"What are the possibilities
for the adjacent cell?",00:26:35.960,00:26:40.720
"Plus or minus 1, yeah, into
cell i minus 1 or i plus 1.",00:26:40.720,00:26:50.120
Nothing else moves.,00:26:50.120,00:26:51.085
"Hence, the order of
the items is preserved.",00:26:59.230,00:27:05.920
"Because if you're going
with i to i plus 1,",00:27:16.640,00:27:19.600
"everything else is in i minus
1 or less, i plus 2 or more.",00:27:19.600,00:27:23.450
"Relative order does not
change in this case.",00:27:23.450,00:27:25.790
And I'll claim that's enough.,00:27:28.450,00:27:30.570
"You know that I've thought
about it a little bit.",00:27:30.570,00:27:32.910
"I've really quantified that i
goes to i minus 1 or i plus 1.",00:27:32.910,00:27:35.820
Nothing else moves.,00:27:35.820,00:27:37.460
"Therefore, we're done.",00:27:37.460,00:27:38.780
"Now, I could've added
some more sentences here,",00:27:38.780,00:27:40.920
like I talked about.,00:27:40.920,00:27:42.400
"But this is probably enough
in this case, for this guy.",00:27:42.400,00:27:46.050
"So in fact, if we
only had row moves,",00:27:48.610,00:27:53.400
there's not much that happens.,00:27:53.400,00:27:54.650
"The order never
changes with row moves.",00:27:54.650,00:27:57.184
So we never get there.,00:27:57.184,00:27:58.100
"But column moves are
more interesting.",00:27:58.100,00:27:59.683
"So as an example of a column
move, a, b, c, d, f, h, e,",00:28:06.320,00:28:19.042
g-- say I move the g up.,00:28:19.042,00:28:23.220
"Then I would get this one--
a, b, c, d, f, g-- because g",00:28:23.220,00:28:33.000
"moved up-- h, e.",00:28:33.000,00:28:35.420
So g went to there.,00:28:35.420,00:28:36.550
"Did the ordering
change for this move?",00:28:40.240,00:28:43.690
Yeah.,00:28:43.690,00:28:46.300
How so?,00:28:46.300,00:28:48.450
What things changed order?,00:28:48.450,00:28:49.570
"Which pairs of
letters changed order?",00:28:49.570,00:28:51.630
AUDIENCE: G changed [INAUDIBLE].,00:28:54.576,00:28:56.540
"PROFESSOR: G changed by three--
moved three in the order.",00:28:56.540,00:29:00.450
"And what letters did it
change relative order with?",00:29:00.450,00:29:04.837
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:29:04.837,00:29:07.831
AUDIENCE: The two preceding it.,00:29:07.831,00:29:09.830
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
two preceding it.",00:29:09.830,00:29:11.800
g used to be after h and e.,00:29:11.800,00:29:14.790
Now it's before h and e.,00:29:14.790,00:29:18.070
"All right, so it changed
relative order with two items.",00:29:18.070,00:29:21.750
"It changed its
position by three.",00:29:21.750,00:29:23.300
"It moved up three
in the ordering.",00:29:23.300,00:29:25.100
"And so it changed order
with the two in between.",00:29:25.100,00:29:28.020
Let's look at another one.,00:29:28.020,00:29:30.630
"Because we're really
doing these examples",00:29:30.630,00:29:32.760
"to hunt for an
invariant, is what",00:29:32.760,00:29:35.190
"we're trying to do
here-- something",00:29:35.190,00:29:37.530
"that will let us prove we can
never get to the desired state.",00:29:37.530,00:29:41.710
Let's look at this one.,00:29:41.710,00:29:43.750
"a, b, c, d, g, h,
e, f goes to-- I'm",00:29:43.750,00:29:54.050
"going to move b down this
time-- a, c, d, b, g, h, e, f.",00:29:54.050,00:30:05.680
So b moves down.,00:30:05.680,00:30:09.225
The relative order changes.,00:30:09.225,00:30:12.470
"Which pairs got changed
in the relative order?",00:30:12.470,00:30:15.120
AUDIENCE: b.,00:30:19.870,00:30:20.820
PROFESSOR: b changed with--,00:30:20.820,00:30:22.264
AUDIENCE: c and [INAUDIBLE].,00:30:22.264,00:30:23.430
PROFESSOR: c and d.,00:30:23.430,00:30:27.070
"b used to be before c and
d. when it moves down here,",00:30:27.070,00:30:30.380
it goes after c and d.,00:30:30.380,00:30:34.160
"Any guess about what
Lemma Two is going to be?",00:30:34.160,00:30:37.580
"What happens when we
make a column move?",00:30:37.580,00:30:40.544
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:30:40.544,00:30:41.460
PROFESSOR: Change the order of--,00:30:41.460,00:30:44.192
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:30:44.192,00:30:45.108
"PROFESSOR: Good,
so a column move",00:30:50.030,00:30:52.770
"changes the order of a
guy with the previous two",00:30:52.770,00:30:55.971
"or the next two, which means
the relative order of two pairs",00:30:55.971,00:30:58.470
change.,00:30:58.470,00:30:59.887
So let's take that as Lemma Two.,00:30:59.887,00:31:01.220
"When we say don't
do proof by example,",00:31:04.750,00:31:06.660
"we don't mean
don't try examples.",00:31:06.660,00:31:09.220
"Because by trying
examples, you find out",00:31:09.220,00:31:11.300
what you're trying to prove.,00:31:11.300,00:31:13.370
So that's good to do.,00:31:13.370,00:31:15.680
"A column move changes the
relative order of precisely two",00:31:15.680,00:31:39.600
pairs of items.,00:31:39.600,00:31:40.670
So let's prove that.,00:31:46.860,00:31:47.750
"In a column move, we move
an item in cell i for some i",00:31:53.130,00:32:12.010
to a blank spot in cell what?,00:32:12.010,00:32:22.642
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:32:22.642,00:32:24.580
"PROFESSOR: i minus
3 or i plus 3?",00:32:24.580,00:32:27.334
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:32:27.334,00:32:28.250
"PROFESSOR: OK, and just to
see that, let's draw out",00:32:31.860,00:32:35.590
the natural order.,00:32:35.590,00:32:36.340
"I've got 1 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.",00:32:36.340,00:32:40.890
"Column moves could be here--
1 to 4, and 4 to 1, 2 and 5,",00:32:40.890,00:32:46.690
"3 and 6, 4 and 7,
5 and 8, 6 and 9.",00:32:46.690,00:32:51.880
"All 12 possible column
moves, this works for.",00:32:51.880,00:32:55.810
They're always separated by 3.,00:32:55.810,00:32:57.310
"And when an item
moves three positions,",00:33:00.170,00:33:17.080
"it changes relative order
with two other items.",00:33:17.080,00:33:19.540
"And you can even write
down what they are.",00:33:27.360,00:33:29.950
"It's i minus 1, i minus
2, or i plus 1, i plus 2.",00:33:29.950,00:33:36.942
"Those are the guys it
changes order with.",00:33:36.942,00:33:38.650
"All right, we've
got two lemmas here.",00:33:42.559,00:33:44.100
That one's done now.,00:33:44.100,00:33:46.380
"In a row move, order
does not change.",00:33:46.380,00:33:49.100
"In a column move, two pairs
of letters get flipped.",00:33:49.100,00:33:55.070
"That's all you can do
with this puzzle now.",00:33:55.070,00:33:58.240
"So can anybody
think of something",00:33:58.240,00:34:01.950
"we can work with to get an
invariant here-- something",00:34:01.950,00:34:04.890
that won't change?,00:34:04.890,00:34:06.460
What we should be focusing on?,00:34:06.460,00:34:07.710
Yeah.,00:34:07.710,00:34:09.070
"AUDIENCE: You can only switch
two pairs of items at a time.",00:34:09.070,00:34:12.990
"So if you don't have an
even number [INAUDIBLE]",00:34:12.990,00:34:18.380
switch [INAUDIBLE].,00:34:18.380,00:34:20.850
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's good.",00:34:20.850,00:34:22.199
"So really, to focus
in on there is,",00:34:22.199,00:34:24.139
"if you have an even number
of things out of order",00:34:24.139,00:34:27.600
"to start, you're going to
have an even number forever,",00:34:27.600,00:34:30.620
"because you can only
change two at a time.",00:34:30.620,00:34:32.860
That's a great idea.,00:34:32.860,00:34:33.820
"Let's really specify that
now, and define that.",00:34:33.820,00:34:38.159
"A pair of letters or items,
call them L1 and L2--",00:34:42.840,00:34:52.420
"they form an inversion, also

"but L1 appears after
L2 in the puzzle.",00:35:24.160,00:35:27.140
"All right, so that
is an inversion.",00:35:38.170,00:35:41.470

see how many inversions",00:35:41.470,00:35:43.960
do we have in this case?,00:35:43.960,00:35:45.060

c, f, d, g, e, h.",00:35:49.060,00:35:57.850

are there in the start state",00:36:54.040,00:37:02.180
way back over here?,00:37:02.180,00:37:05.100
How many inverted pairs here?,00:37:05.100,00:37:08.440
One inversion.,00:37:08.440,00:37:09.215
How many inversions here?,00:37:14.120,00:37:17.986
Zero.,00:37:17.986,00:37:18.485
"All right, and can you see where
we're going to head here now?",00:37:21.960,00:37:27.350
"If I started with
one, that's odd.",00:37:27.350,00:37:32.080
"And every time I do a
row move or column move,",00:37:32.080,00:37:34.190
it's going to stay odd.,00:37:34.190,00:37:35.750
And I can never get here.,00:37:35.750,00:37:38.930
"Is that clear what
we're trying to do?",00:37:38.930,00:37:41.190
So let's keep doing it.,00:37:41.190,00:37:42.380
Let's go over here.,00:37:46.550,00:37:47.350
"All right, so now we'll
use Lemma One and Lemma Two",00:37:59.110,00:38:02.510
"create this notion that we only
change the number of inversions",00:38:02.510,00:38:05.820
by an even number.,00:38:05.820,00:38:07.883
"And Lemma Three-- during a
move, the number of inversions",00:38:07.883,00:38:28.130
"can only increase by
two, decrease by two,",00:38:28.130,00:38:42.500
or stay the same.,00:38:42.500,00:38:44.230
And this proof is pretty easy.,00:38:49.510,00:38:51.210
There's a couple of cases.,00:38:51.210,00:38:53.060
"In a row move, what happens?",00:38:56.910,00:39:01.250
"How does the number
of inversions",00:39:01.250,00:39:04.380
change in a row move?,00:39:04.380,00:39:05.629
AUDIENCE: Stays the same.,00:39:05.629,00:39:06.670
"PROFESSOR: Stays the
same-- no changes--",00:39:06.670,00:39:09.770
and that's by Lemma One.,00:39:09.770,00:39:11.090
"Now, in a column move,
there's three cases.",00:39:17.910,00:39:20.725
"But we know two pairs
change order-- that we know.",00:39:26.330,00:39:29.432
That's Lemma Two.,00:39:29.432,00:39:30.140
"All right, by Lemma
Two, we know that.",00:39:34.117,00:39:35.700
"But the three cases are-- let
me start on the next board.",00:39:39.600,00:39:42.857
"So Case A is that both
of the inverted pairs",00:40:00.780,00:40:07.850
"were in order originally,
before the column move.",00:40:07.850,00:40:14.030
"What happens to the number
of inversions in this case,",00:40:14.030,00:40:17.720
as a result of the column move?,00:40:17.720,00:40:20.588
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:40:20.588,00:40:21.777
PROFESSOR: Goes up by two.,00:40:21.777,00:40:22.860
"Case B is that both
pairs were inverted",00:40:25.700,00:40:31.080
before I made the column move.,00:40:31.080,00:40:34.250
"What happens to the number
of inversions in that case?",00:40:34.250,00:40:37.994
AUDIENCE: Decreases by two.,00:40:37.994,00:40:39.179
"PROFESSOR: Decreases by
two-- they were in order,",00:40:39.179,00:40:41.220
so they were inverted.,00:40:41.220,00:40:42.700
"Now when I flop them,
they become in order.",00:40:42.700,00:40:46.010
So inversions drops by two.,00:40:46.010,00:40:48.470
"And Case C is
there's one of each.",00:40:48.470,00:40:51.650
One of the pairs was inverted.,00:40:51.650,00:40:53.010
The other wasn't.,00:40:57.150,00:40:58.870
"What happens to the number
of inversions in that case?",00:40:58.870,00:41:02.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:41:02.040,00:41:03.030
"PROFESSOR: Yes, stays the same.",00:41:03.030,00:41:04.321
"All right, and we're done.",00:41:10.120,00:41:11.339
"That's what the lemma says-- I
can go up by two, down by two,",00:41:11.339,00:41:13.880
or stay the same.,00:41:13.880,00:41:16.990
"All right, now a simple
corollary of this",00:41:16.990,00:41:21.820
"is that during a move, the
parity-- i.e. even or odd",00:41:21.820,00:41:26.200
"of the number of
inversions stays the same.",00:41:26.200,00:41:29.750
It can't change at all.,00:41:29.750,00:41:30.870
"During a move, the parity--
and the parity means even, odd.",00:41:39.450,00:41:45.840
"Sometimes it's called
0, 1, but the evenness",00:41:45.840,00:41:50.590
"and the oddness of the number
of inversions does not change.",00:41:50.590,00:42:01.460
"AUDIENCE: Instead of two pairs
you mean one pair, right?",00:42:08.456,00:42:11.420
PROFESSOR: Where?,00:42:11.420,00:42:12.902
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] pairs.,00:42:12.902,00:42:15.760
"PROFESSOR: Oops, I mean
one pair's inverted,",00:42:15.760,00:42:18.530
one pair's not.,00:42:18.530,00:42:19.984
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:42:19.984,00:42:20.900
"PROFESSOR: No, I mean two pairs
change order in a column move.",00:42:23.600,00:42:27.860
Let's go back and look at that.,00:42:27.860,00:42:30.600
So I'm doing a column move.,00:42:30.600,00:42:31.980
"For example, g goes up.",00:42:31.980,00:42:36.490
"g, h changes order.",00:42:36.490,00:42:38.470
"g, e changes order.",00:42:38.470,00:42:41.320
"g changes order
with these two guys,",00:42:41.320,00:42:43.610
"so there's two pairs
that got flipped.",00:42:43.610,00:42:47.830
"So in a column move, two
pairs reverse their order.",00:42:47.830,00:42:51.230
"If they were in order,
they become inverted.",00:42:51.230,00:42:53.240
"If they were inverted,
they become in order.",00:42:53.240,00:42:56.792
Any other questions?,00:42:56.792,00:42:57.625
Yeah.,00:43:00.390,00:43:01.350
"AUDIENCE: So we're saying
that letters can be",00:43:01.350,00:43:03.270
numbers in more than one pair?,00:43:03.270,00:43:06.160
"PROFESSOR: Yes, a letter
can be in-- a letter",00:43:06.160,00:43:08.470
"is in seven pairs, because
there's seven other letters.",00:43:08.470,00:43:13.250
"And in fact, we're looking
at a space of 8 times 7",00:43:13.250,00:43:19.000
"divided by 2-- 28
pairs of letters.",00:43:19.000,00:43:22.195
"So there could be 28 inversions
if they're all out of order.",00:43:22.195,00:43:26.237
Any other questions?,00:43:26.237,00:43:27.070
"OK, well, we're getting there.",00:43:30.600,00:43:32.230
We're almost done.,00:43:32.230,00:43:32.980
"I've got to prove this
corollary that during a move,",00:43:32.980,00:43:35.720
"the evenness or oddness of
the number of inversions",00:43:35.720,00:43:38.210
does not change.,00:43:38.210,00:43:38.920
"And that's because adding or
subtracting 2 from a number",00:43:42.450,00:43:46.410
does not change its parity.,00:43:46.410,00:43:48.440
It stays odd or stays even.,00:43:48.440,00:43:51.780
"So adding or subtracting 2
does not change the parity.",00:43:51.780,00:44:03.450
"All right, now we're ready
to state the invariant.",00:44:11.987,00:44:14.070
"Anybody tell me what the
invariant is going to be?",00:44:24.310,00:44:27.930
"What's the invariant going
to be in this system?",00:44:27.930,00:44:31.805
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:44:31.805,00:44:33.140
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, the parity
of the number of inversions",00:44:33.140,00:44:37.630
"is odd, because it
starts that way.",00:44:37.630,00:44:41.650
It's preserved.,00:44:41.650,00:44:42.960
"And it won't hold in
the desired end state",00:44:42.960,00:44:45.720
that we're looking at.,00:44:45.720,00:44:47.182
So we can state that as follows.,00:44:47.182,00:44:48.515
"In every state or
configuration reachable",00:44:55.240,00:45:05.810
"from the start
state, which is a,",00:45:05.810,00:45:13.530
"b, c, d, e, f, h, g--
which are out of order--",00:45:13.530,00:45:21.160
"the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.",00:45:21.160,00:45:30.690
"And the proof will
be by induction.",00:45:35.220,00:45:38.440
"And invariant proofs
are always by induction.",00:45:38.440,00:45:40.750
"And the inductive
hypothesis-- and this",00:45:46.790,00:45:50.100
"is very typical in
a proof by using",00:45:50.100,00:45:52.270
"invariants-- is, so P of n is
after any sequence of n moves",00:45:52.270,00:46:11.910
"from the start state-- in
fact, just the rest of this",00:46:11.910,00:46:17.260
is what it is.,00:46:17.260,00:46:18.020
"All right, so our inductive
hypothesis is P of n,",00:46:25.700,00:46:29.280
"after any sequence of n moves--
so n is the number of moves",00:46:29.280,00:46:33.510
"you took to get there--
from the start state,",00:46:33.510,00:46:37.510
"the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.",00:46:37.510,00:46:41.550
"That is the
inductive hypothesis.",00:46:41.550,00:46:44.180
This is the invariant.,00:46:44.180,00:46:45.680
"And they become
one and the same.",00:46:45.680,00:46:47.380
"And the parameter n is the
number of moves you've taken.",00:46:47.380,00:46:50.960
"And that's how you set up
a proof using an invariant.",00:46:50.960,00:46:53.625
It always looks just like this.,00:46:53.625,00:46:55.774
"OK, so we're doing a
proof by induction.",00:47:16.550,00:47:19.220
"We've got the
inductive hypothesis.",00:47:19.220,00:47:22.720
What's the next step?,00:47:22.720,00:47:24.837
AUDIENCE: Base case.,00:47:24.837,00:47:25.670
PROFESSOR: Base case.,00:47:25.670,00:47:26.545
"And in these circumstances,
where the proof by invariant,",00:47:32.456,00:47:34.830
the base case is always 0.,00:47:34.830,00:47:37.590
We haven't made any moves yet.,00:47:37.590,00:47:40.020
"Now in this case, if
we haven't made moves,",00:47:40.020,00:47:41.860
"the number of inversions in
the start state now is 1.",00:47:41.860,00:47:48.870
"That means the parity is
odd, and the hypothesis",00:47:48.870,00:47:55.380
is satisfied.,00:47:55.380,00:47:56.230
"P of 0 is true, because in
any sequence of zero moves,",00:47:56.230,00:48:00.650
after this-- i.e.,00:48:00.650,00:48:02.092
"in this state-- you've
got one inversion.",00:48:02.092,00:48:03.800
That's odd.,00:48:03.800,00:48:06.602
"The last step is
the inductive step.",00:48:06.602,00:48:08.815
"And here we need to show for
any n bigger or equal to 0,",00:48:16.690,00:48:22.510
"we need to show P of n implies
p of n plus 1 is true--",00:48:22.510,00:48:29.980
the standard thing.,00:48:29.980,00:48:32.990
So let's look at P n plus 1.,00:48:32.990,00:48:35.770
"That's talking
about where we are",00:48:35.770,00:48:38.260
"after a sequence of n plus
1 moves in the puzzle,",00:48:38.260,00:48:42.550
from the start state.,00:48:42.550,00:48:45.610
"So let's consider any
sequence of n plus 1 moves.",00:48:45.610,00:48:58.790
"And call these
moves-- label them",00:48:58.790,00:49:00.545
by M1 all the way to M n plus 1.,00:49:00.545,00:49:05.394
Those are the moves we made.,00:49:05.394,00:49:06.560
"Now, by the inductive
hypothesis, because of P n,",00:49:09.080,00:49:13.680
"we know that after the first n
moves, the parity is still odd.",00:49:13.680,00:49:17.720
That's what P n says.,00:49:17.720,00:49:20.170
That's P n.,00:49:20.170,00:49:20.980
"After any sequence
of n moves from here,",00:49:20.980,00:49:24.774
"the parity of the number
of inversions is odd.",00:49:24.774,00:49:26.690
"So we could say by the
inductive hypothesis,",00:49:29.490,00:49:31.460
"or we could say by P n, we know
that the parity after moves",00:49:31.460,00:49:48.450
M1 out to M n is odd.,00:49:48.450,00:49:54.340
"Now, by Corollary One-- do
we still have Corollary One?",00:50:00.130,00:50:05.240
[INAUDIBLE],00:50:05.240,00:50:06.724
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:50:06.724,00:50:07.640
"PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE], yeah,
good, we've got Corollary One.",00:50:07.640,00:50:10.140
"During any move, the
parity doesn't change.",00:50:10.140,00:50:14.650
"That says from after the nth
move to after the n plus 1st",00:50:14.650,00:50:19.190
"move-- one extra move--
doesn't change the parity.",00:50:19.190,00:50:22.141
So it's still odd.,00:50:22.141,00:50:22.890
"So next, by Corollary
One, we know",00:50:40.600,00:50:50.080
"that the parity of the
number of inversions",00:50:50.080,00:50:59.010
"does not change
during M n plus 1.",00:50:59.010,00:51:01.840
"Therefore, this implies that
the parity after all n plus 1",00:51:14.744,00:51:25.710
moves-- these guys-- is odd.,00:51:25.710,00:51:35.340
It started odd.,00:51:35.340,00:51:37.180
It stayed odd after the first n.,00:51:37.180,00:51:39.150
"It stayed odd during
the n plus 1st.",00:51:39.150,00:51:41.580
So it's odd.,00:51:41.580,00:51:43.940
"And that's exactly the
statement of P n plus 1.",00:51:43.940,00:51:48.780
"So we've completed
the induction.",00:51:48.780,00:51:50.740
"We've shown that P n
implies P n plus 1.",00:51:50.740,00:51:53.247
"All right, so now, any
questions so far on this?",00:51:56.450,00:52:01.241
Yeah.,00:52:01.241,00:52:01.989
"AUDIENCE: What's the
difference between a lemma",00:52:01.989,00:52:03.947

"PROFESSOR: Really, there's
not a lot of difference.",00:52:05.300,00:52:07.440

is something that's",00:52:07.440,00:52:09.450
"a simple consequence
of something else.",00:52:09.450,00:52:12.870

a pretty short proof.",00:52:12.870,00:52:16.734
"Usually when you see corollary,
that's not a 10-page proof",00:52:16.734,00:52:19.150
there.,00:52:19.150,00:52:19.770
"A lemma is something
that you're going",00:52:19.770,00:52:22.410
"to use as a tool for
a bigger thing, often",00:52:22.410,00:52:25.010
a theorem or another lemma.,00:52:25.010,00:52:27.060

get to the theorem, which",00:52:27.060,00:52:29.970
"is sort of the final thing--
the thing we're really after.",00:52:29.970,00:52:32.820
And that's sort of the big deal.,00:52:32.820,00:52:34.315
"And now the proof
will be simple,",00:52:34.315,00:52:35.690

So let's prove the theorem now.,00:52:57.060,00:52:58.400
"The parity of the
number of inversions",00:53:28.590,00:53:39.030
in the desired state-- i.e.,00:53:39.030,00:53:42.520
"in order-- the target
state-- is even.",00:53:42.520,00:53:51.050
Nothing's out of order.,00:53:51.050,00:53:52.160
There's zero inversions.,00:53:52.160,00:53:55.320
"By Lemma Four, the desired
state cannot be reached from",00:53:55.320,00:54:07.030
"the start state, because
its parity is odd,",00:54:07.030,00:54:26.450
using legal moves.,00:54:26.450,00:54:27.750
So we're done.,00:54:27.750,00:54:28.420
"So the proof of the
theorem-- by now,",00:54:28.420,00:54:30.290
"it's short, because we did four
lemmas, a corollary, and lots",00:54:30.290,00:54:34.200
of argument.,00:54:34.200,00:54:34.790
"Could you have solved the puzzle
if I allow the blank to be",00:54:38.850,00:54:43.010
somewhere else at the end?,00:54:43.010,00:54:46.680
Is the puzzle solvable then?,00:54:46.680,00:54:48.250
No.,00:54:51.180,00:54:52.250
Why not?,00:54:52.250,00:54:52.790
"Doesn't impact the parity at
all, so you can't do that.",00:54:55.770,00:54:58.105
"Again, the idea
here-- and you'll",00:55:04.450,00:55:06.300
"get some practice
in homework-- is",00:55:06.300,00:55:08.850
"you're looking for a property
that holds at the beginning,",00:55:08.850,00:55:12.140
"is preserved by every
step, but is not",00:55:12.140,00:55:15.400
present in the target state.,00:55:15.400,00:55:19.190
"Now actually, this puzzle
was enormously popular",00:55:19.190,00:55:22.980
in the late 1880s.,00:55:22.980,00:55:25.260
"In fact there was $1,000
prize offered for anybody",00:55:25.260,00:55:29.260
"who could solve
the larger version.",00:55:29.260,00:55:31.640
"Back then, it was the 15
puzzle, which you can still",00:55:31.640,00:55:34.310
"buy today-- same problem
on a 4 by 4 grid--",00:55:34.310,00:55:37.740
exactly the same problem.,00:55:37.740,00:55:39.150
A pair is out of order.,00:55:39.150,00:55:40.470
You've got to get them in order.,00:55:40.470,00:55:42.430
You can't do it.,00:55:42.430,00:55:44.510
"Now, the proof
you can't do it is",00:55:44.510,00:55:46.460
"a little harder-- same
idea-- one extra idea",00:55:46.460,00:55:50.210
in it-- one extra lemma.,00:55:50.210,00:55:52.570
And that's for homework.,00:55:52.570,00:55:54.080
"So you'll go through and
see exactly the structure",00:55:54.080,00:55:56.700
with one extra little trick it.,00:55:56.700,00:55:59.360
"But back then, I guess most
people didn't-- of course,",00:55:59.360,00:56:02.177
"most people didn't
realize it wasn't doable.",00:56:02.177,00:56:04.010
"So they could offer
this price safely.",00:56:04.010,00:56:06.250
"$1,000 then is probably worth a
quarter million dollars today.",00:56:06.250,00:56:11.130
"Any questions on
the eight puzzle?",00:56:11.130,00:56:13.440
Yeah.,00:56:13.440,00:56:15.624
"AUDIENCE: The
inductive steps-- when",00:56:15.624,00:56:19.261
"you said, ""by inductive
hypothesis,"" [INAUDIBLE] parity",00:56:19.261,00:56:23.064
"after, shouldn't the
first term be M0?",00:56:23.064,00:56:27.465
PROFESSOR: Let's see.,00:56:27.465,00:56:28.340
"No, the first move is M1.",00:56:28.340,00:56:31.250
The second is M2.,00:56:31.250,00:56:33.410
"Now, when I talk
about zero moves,",00:56:33.410,00:56:36.859
"that means no moves
are taking place.",00:56:36.859,00:56:38.400
I'm still in the start state.,00:56:38.400,00:56:39.970
"So a move is a transition
between states.",00:56:39.970,00:56:42.920
So you could have state 0.,00:56:42.920,00:56:44.160
That's the start state.,00:56:44.160,00:56:45.556
"State one would be the
move after move one.",00:56:45.556,00:56:49.685
Have I got that right here?,00:56:49.685,00:56:50.810
"So the inductive step, I need
to show P0 zero implies P1.",00:56:50.810,00:56:56.550
"P1 implies P2, and so forth.",00:56:56.550,00:56:59.070
"And P n is the parity of
inversions after n moves.",00:56:59.070,00:57:03.620
So you could have state s0.,00:57:06.200,00:57:07.670
"We didn't label the states here,
but you could have state s0.",00:57:07.670,00:57:12.835
Yeah.,00:57:12.835,00:57:13.817
"AUDIENCE: So in this problem,
we assume that everything should",00:57:13.817,00:57:17.499
be defined as rows or columns.,00:57:17.499,00:57:20.830
"How do we know when the
assumptions are valid?",00:57:20.830,00:57:25.454
"PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.",00:57:25.454,00:57:26.870
"OK, so really,
there's two cases.",00:57:26.870,00:57:31.071
"To be really precise,
we should have",00:57:31.071,00:57:32.570
"argued there's only two types of
moves, a row move and a column",00:57:32.570,00:57:35.510
move.,00:57:35.510,00:57:36.037
"And in fact, if you look at what
can move into a blank square,",00:57:36.037,00:57:38.620
"there's four guys that
can do it-- the guy above,",00:57:38.620,00:57:40.919
"the guy to the right, the guy
to the left, and the guy below.",00:57:40.919,00:57:43.460
"Two of those are row
moves, two are columns.",00:57:43.460,00:57:45.549
"So that's right-- to really
pin down the details,",00:57:45.549,00:57:47.590
"we should have checked those
are the only two possible moves.",00:57:47.590,00:57:50.696
"And if there was a third kind of
move that I hadn't considered,",00:57:50.696,00:57:53.320
this proof would be bogus.,00:57:53.320,00:57:55.860
That's a good question.,00:57:55.860,00:57:58.290
Any other questions?,00:57:58.290,00:57:59.141
OK.,00:58:02.230,00:58:04.880
"Now, I think
probably, you see why",00:58:04.880,00:58:07.142
the invariants are important.,00:58:07.142,00:58:08.350
"But say that someday,
you're building software",00:58:08.350,00:58:12.290
to run a nuclear reactor.,00:58:12.290,00:58:14.762
"Now, there's a certain
state you'd really",00:58:14.762,00:58:16.470
like to avoid-- meltdown.,00:58:16.470,00:58:19.530
"And you'd like to
be able to prove",00:58:19.530,00:58:21.310
"that, in any sequence of moves
that happen in your reactor",00:58:21.310,00:58:25.220
"program, you never reach
the meltdown state.",00:58:25.220,00:58:28.800
"Well you'd use
invariants to do that.",00:58:28.800,00:58:31.160
"Or if you're building
software for an airplane,",00:58:31.160,00:58:34.950
"you'd like to never
reach the crash state.",00:58:34.950,00:58:37.400
"Or if you're building
a radiation device,",00:58:37.400,00:58:39.860
"you never want to get in the
state that fries the patient.",00:58:39.860,00:58:44.330
So this is an important notion.,00:58:44.330,00:58:48.425
"So for the rest
of the day, we're",00:58:48.425,00:58:49.800
"going to talk about a
different kind of induction",00:58:49.800,00:58:52.470
called strong induction.,00:58:52.470,00:58:55.390
"It's very similar to
ordinary induction,",00:58:55.390,00:58:58.020
"but it's a little easier to use
when solving certain problems.",00:58:58.020,00:59:02.970
"Now like regular
induction, strong induction",00:59:02.970,00:59:05.820
can be expressed with an axiom.,00:59:05.820,00:59:07.908
"So let me show you the
strong induction axiom.",00:59:12.490,00:59:14.594
"You have a predicate,
P n, like before.",00:59:44.420,00:59:46.420
"If P0 is true-- your base
case-- and for all n,",00:59:54.570,01:00:04.840
"it's not P n implies P
n plus 1, it's P0 and P1",01:00:04.840,01:00:10.330
"and dot, dot, dot, and P n
are all true, then P n plus 1.",01:00:10.330,01:00:19.430
"If this is true for all n,
then P n is true for all n.",01:00:19.430,01:00:29.242
"Now, the only difference
between strong induction",01:00:38.410,01:00:41.470
"and ordinary induction that
we did last time is this part.",01:00:41.470,01:00:46.380
"In ordinary induction,
you're showing",01:00:49.460,01:00:52.220
that P n implies P n plus 1.,01:00:52.220,01:00:54.830
"In strong induction, you're
showing that all these facts",01:00:54.830,01:00:58.360
put together imply P n plus 1.,01:00:58.360,01:01:02.880
"Now, to show
implication, remember,",01:01:02.880,01:01:04.810
"you get to assume that
all these things are true.",01:01:04.810,01:01:08.234
"So you know how in
ordinary induction, we say,",01:01:08.234,01:01:10.150
"""assume P n is true and you're
going to prove P n plus 1?""",01:01:10.150,01:01:13.890
"In strong induction, you get
to say, ""assume P n is true,",01:01:13.890,01:01:17.440
"P n minus 1 is true, dot,
dot, dot, P1 is true,",01:01:17.440,01:01:20.070
and P0 is true.,01:01:20.070,01:01:21.840
You get to assume a lot more.,01:01:21.840,01:01:24.650
"So it's a stronger
proof technique,",01:01:24.650,01:01:26.810
"because it allows you to do
more-- or so you would think.",01:01:26.810,01:01:30.520
"Now in fact, any proof you
can do with strong induction,",01:01:30.520,01:01:34.162
"you can do with
ordinary induction.",01:01:34.162,01:01:35.620
It just might be harder.,01:01:35.620,01:01:36.990
"So you can't prove
any more with it,",01:01:36.990,01:01:38.600
"but it makes your
proofs much easier.",01:01:38.600,01:01:40.300
"And we're going to do
an example in a minute",01:01:40.300,01:01:42.133
"where the proof is
much easier by getting",01:01:42.133,01:01:44.320
"to assume all of these
things are true in order",01:01:44.320,01:01:47.330
to prove P n plus 1.,01:01:47.330,01:01:50.880
"Are there any questions
about the difference here",01:01:50.880,01:01:53.990
"with strong induction-- that
now you get to assume all these",01:01:53.990,01:01:57.150
"are true as part of
the inductive step?",01:01:57.150,01:02:01.910
All right.,01:02:01.910,01:02:02.410
"Our first example of
a strong induction",01:02:04.930,01:02:07.410
is going to be a simple game.,01:02:07.410,01:02:10.210
"We've got a stack of
eight blocks here.",01:02:10.210,01:02:13.380
"Now, in this game,
what you're going to do",01:02:13.380,01:02:15.680
"is divide the stack
into two sub-stacks.",01:02:15.680,01:02:21.490
"So I just took eight, and
split it into three and five.",01:02:21.490,01:02:25.470
"For that move, you get
15 points-- 3 times 5.",01:02:25.470,01:02:30.390
Let's write that down.,01:02:30.390,01:02:31.490
"OK, so this is called
the Unstacking Game.",01:02:45.370,01:02:47.450
"And in the first move, we
went 8 split to 5 and 3.",01:02:54.810,01:03:02.140
And that's worth 15 points.,01:03:02.140,01:03:03.940
"Now in the next move, I'm going
to split the stack of five",01:03:06.850,01:03:12.100
into four and one.,01:03:12.100,01:03:14.160
"And for that, you get
4 points-- 4 times 1.",01:03:14.160,01:03:16.760
"And I keep on going until I
have a stacks of height one.",01:03:21.230,01:03:26.610
"And the last move, I'll be
splitting a two into two ones.",01:03:26.610,01:03:29.270
That'll give me one point.,01:03:29.270,01:03:30.810
"Then I add up all the points,
and that's your score.",01:03:30.810,01:03:35.080
"And the goal is to get
the most number of points",01:03:35.080,01:03:38.630
"when you add up
the entire score.",01:03:38.630,01:03:41.200
"Now, just so this game is
clear, we're going to play it.",01:03:41.200,01:03:45.730
"And I'm going to
raise the stakes here.",01:03:45.730,01:03:48.049
"What we're going to
do is we're going",01:03:48.049,01:03:49.590
"to have a competition
between three members",01:03:49.590,01:03:51.980
of the class and the TAs.,01:03:51.980,01:03:55.610
"Now, if the class team
wins-- they get more points--",01:03:55.610,01:04:00.020
"we're going to give
everybody in the class candy.",01:04:00.020,01:04:02.720
And I've got lots of candy here.,01:04:02.720,01:04:06.340
"If the TAs beat you,
they get the candy.",01:04:06.340,01:04:09.668
AUDIENCE: What if it's a tie?,01:04:09.668,01:04:11.610
"PROFESSOR: We'll
figure that out.",01:04:11.610,01:04:13.679
We'll come to that later.,01:04:13.679,01:04:14.720
But you want to win this thing.,01:04:14.720,01:04:16.140
"So I need some
volunteers from the class",01:04:16.140,01:04:18.216
who think they can do well.,01:04:18.216,01:04:19.340
"Yeah, come on down.",01:04:19.340,01:04:21.030
You two guys come on down.,01:04:21.030,01:04:23.740
"All right, TAs come on up.",01:04:23.740,01:04:25.000
"Now, I want you
to make some noise",01:04:30.030,01:04:31.760
"if you think your three class
reps here can beat the TAs.",01:04:31.760,01:04:35.796
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE],01:04:35.796,01:04:38.102
"All right, how many
people-- make some noise you",01:04:38.102,01:04:40.970
think the TAs are going to win.,01:04:40.970,01:04:42.540
AUDIENCE: Ooh.,01:04:42.540,01:04:43.212
"PROFESSOR: Ooh, that's nasty.",01:04:43.212,01:04:44.420
"It must've been a rough
recitation last week",01:04:44.420,01:04:47.180
on Wednesday.,01:04:47.180,01:04:48.930
"All right, so let's see.",01:04:48.930,01:04:50.884
"I think we're going to
let the class go first.",01:04:50.884,01:04:52.800
This is your stack.,01:04:52.800,01:04:54.160
"Now think about what move
you want to make first,",01:04:54.160,01:04:56.270
because that matters.,01:04:56.270,01:04:57.750
"And you guys can give them
some advice if you want,",01:04:57.750,01:05:00.630
"as to the move they
should make first.",01:05:00.630,01:05:02.887
"And I'm going to
keep score over here.",01:05:02.887,01:05:04.470
"Oh, OK, they went
for the maximum move.",01:05:08.820,01:05:11.070
That's good.,01:05:11.070,01:05:11.580
"They realized 4 times
4 is 16-- very good.",01:05:11.580,01:05:16.160
So let's write that up here.,01:05:16.160,01:05:19.705
You're Off to a good start.,01:05:19.705,01:05:23.380
"In fact, that's the
maximum number of points",01:05:23.380,01:05:25.370
"for the first move,
I think-- good job.",01:05:25.370,01:05:28.720
"All right, so here's
the class here.",01:05:32.320,01:05:36.490
And here are the TAs.,01:05:36.490,01:05:37.640
"And the class went 8 into

candy for you guys.",01:05:59.910,01:06:03.230

good, interesting.",01:06:48.931,01:06:52.279
So we have three and one.,01:06:52.279,01:06:53.320
That gives you 3 points.,01:06:53.320,01:06:56.110

that any strategy gives 28?",01:10:41.210,01:10:44.325
Hmm.,01:10:47.160,01:10:49.590

eating the candy.",01:11:01.110,01:11:02.520

"And you can't do
worse than 28, either.",01:11:10.370,01:11:12.310

have to throw it to the class",01:11:14.399,01:11:16.690

"OK, so while you're
doing that, let's",01:12:59.170,01:13:01.340
try to prove this theorem.,01:13:01.340,01:13:02.590
"So the theorem is that all
strategies for the n-block game",01:13:16.130,01:13:21.830
produce the same score.,01:13:21.830,01:13:25.460
It wasn't a coincidence for 8.,01:13:25.460,01:13:26.765
"And the score, we'll call it
S of n for the n-block game.",01:13:31.900,01:13:36.070
"So for example, we're trying
to show that S of 8 was 28.",01:13:36.070,01:13:41.420
"So what strategy
do you think we're",01:13:45.760,01:13:47.380
going to use for the proof?,01:13:47.380,01:13:48.505
AUDIENCE: Strong induction.,01:13:49.146,01:13:50.270
"PROFESSOR: Strong
induction-- so you",01:13:50.270,01:13:51.784
"want to write that down--
proof by strong induction.",01:13:51.784,01:13:53.950
"What's the next step in a
proof by any kind of induction?",01:14:02.110,01:14:07.430
AUDIENCE: Base case.,01:14:07.430,01:14:08.650
PROFESSOR: Base case-- not yet.,01:14:08.650,01:14:11.230
AUDIENCE: The predicate.,01:14:11.230,01:14:12.230
"PROFESSOR: The predicate--
what's the predicate here?",01:14:12.230,01:14:15.880
"All right, so for the
inductive hypothesis,",01:14:15.880,01:14:19.460
"the predicate-- any guesses as
to what P of n is going to be?",01:14:19.460,01:14:24.118
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,01:14:24.118,01:14:26.330
PROFESSOR: What's that?,01:14:26.330,01:14:27.288
"AUDIENCE: n should
be 2n minus 1 by 2.",01:14:27.288,01:14:31.070
"PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's part of it,",01:14:31.070,01:14:33.280
"but we're going to use this
as a predicate to start with.",01:14:33.280,01:14:36.680
You've gone a step ahead there.,01:14:36.680,01:14:38.882
"So I'm going to start with
this as being a predicate,",01:14:38.882,01:14:41.090
"because I'm trying to
show they're all the same.",01:14:41.090,01:14:43.150
"And I haven't figured out
what the scores going to be.",01:14:43.150,01:14:45.400
"But I think you're already
on a good track here for what",01:14:45.400,01:14:47.970
the score is going to be.,01:14:47.970,01:14:50.410
Now we do the base case.,01:14:50.410,01:14:51.948
"So we take n equals
1-- the one-block game.",01:14:58.430,01:15:02.770
S of 1 is 0.,01:15:02.770,01:15:05.130
We never took a move.,01:15:05.130,01:15:06.170
We never got a score.,01:15:06.170,01:15:07.080
There was only one block.,01:15:07.080,01:15:08.150
We ended before we started.,01:15:08.150,01:15:10.560
So that's OK.,01:15:10.560,01:15:13.680
"And now we have
the inductive step.",01:15:13.680,01:15:15.235
"And here we get to assume P1,
P2, all the way up to P n,",01:15:18.660,01:15:29.510
to prove P n plus 1.,01:15:29.510,01:15:31.610
"And so now we look
at n plus 1 blocks,",01:15:36.020,01:15:41.791
because that's we're starting.,01:15:41.791,01:15:43.040
"So we have n plus 1,
and we split it somehow.",01:15:48.210,01:15:51.890
And it could be any split.,01:15:51.890,01:15:53.500
"We might have K on one
side, then n plus 1 minus K",01:15:53.500,01:15:57.700
"on the other side for
any K between 1 and n.",01:15:57.700,01:16:01.727
"And let's figure out our
score for that scenario.",01:16:05.630,01:16:08.660
"Well, we get the
product of these numbers",01:16:12.600,01:16:15.170
for the first step.,01:16:15.170,01:16:18.060
"We get K times n plus 1
minus K for the first step.",01:16:18.060,01:16:24.100
"And then as we recurse,
and we split up",01:16:24.100,01:16:27.750
"that block of K blocks,
how many points do we",01:16:27.750,01:16:31.300
"get for splitting
that all the way down?",01:16:31.300,01:16:34.030
AUDIENCE: P of K.,01:16:34.030,01:16:34.900
"PROFESSOR: P of K, because
that's the induction.",01:16:34.900,01:16:37.191
"We assume that as part of
the induction hypothesis.",01:16:37.191,01:16:39.315
"And how many points do
we get for splitting",01:16:42.700,01:16:45.080
this stack all the way down?,01:16:45.080,01:16:46.260
"Yeah, P of n plus 1 minus K.",01:16:48.940,01:16:55.590
"And you see why
strong induction's",01:16:55.590,01:16:57.330
coming in handy here?,01:16:57.330,01:17:00.310
"For the TA's strategy,
K would be 1.",01:17:00.310,01:17:02.990
We know P of 1 is 0.,01:17:02.990,01:17:05.099
"And you would just need
ordinary induction.",01:17:05.099,01:17:06.890
This would be P of n.,01:17:06.890,01:17:08.760
"But for a general strategy,
it could be any split.",01:17:08.760,01:17:11.300
"So we need to have all
these assumed here.",01:17:11.300,01:17:13.110
"It makes it much easier
when using strong induction.",01:17:13.110,01:17:18.330
"All right, so this
is our total score",01:17:18.330,01:17:20.310
"for the game for
n plus 1 blocks.",01:17:20.310,01:17:23.180
"And we're trying to show
it just depends on n,",01:17:23.180,01:17:28.240
"and that it doesn't depend
on K. Does that depend on K?",01:17:28.240,01:17:33.149
"Looks like it to me, right?",01:17:38.030,01:17:40.210
I got K in every single term.,01:17:40.210,01:17:44.020
So I'm not there.,01:17:44.020,01:17:44.740
I'm stuck.,01:17:44.740,01:17:45.240
You see why I'm stuck?,01:17:47.720,01:17:48.939
"Because I'd like to be able
to say that the score I get",01:17:48.939,01:17:51.230
"for the n plus one
block game-- this",01:17:51.230,01:17:54.120
"is S n plus 1-- is the same
for any sequence of moves.",01:17:54.120,01:17:58.520
"It doesn't even depend on
K. But I can't do that.",01:17:58.520,01:18:02.260
"What do you do when you're
stuck with an induction proof?",01:18:02.260,01:18:05.310
What's one of the tricks?,01:18:05.310,01:18:06.460

it stronger, which",01:18:07.584,01:18:09.800

one up there before.",01:18:13.360,01:18:17.030

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,01:18:22.052,01:18:23.960
"PROFESSOR: Give the
formula for S n-- that",01:18:23.960,01:18:27.320
would make it stronger.,01:18:27.320,01:18:28.360
I tell you what it is.,01:18:28.360,01:18:30.140
"What's a good guess
for the formula here?",01:18:30.140,01:18:32.760
AUDIENCE: Factorial.,01:18:32.760,01:18:33.700
"PROFESSOR: Factorial-- Well,
is S of 8 equal 8 factorial?",01:18:33.700,01:18:41.580
"No, not so good.",01:18:41.580,01:18:44.234
[SIDE CONVERSATION],01:18:44.234,01:18:46.631
"AUDIENCE: n equals
n minus 1 over 2.",01:18:46.631,01:18:48.130
"PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a better guess--",01:18:48.130,01:18:51.510
equals n times n minus 1 over 2.,01:18:51.510,01:18:56.160
"And in fact, what's
8 times 7 over 2?",01:18:56.160,01:18:59.750
It's 28.,01:18:59.750,01:19:00.330
It works here.,01:19:00.330,01:19:01.770
Let's check another one.,01:19:01.770,01:19:02.770
What's S of 2?,01:19:02.770,01:19:04.520
AUDIENCE: 1.,01:19:07.171,01:19:07.670
"PROFESSOR: 1-- well, 2
times 1 over 2-- it works.",01:19:07.670,01:19:12.740
What's S of 3?,01:19:12.740,01:19:14.690
"2 the first move, then 1 more.",01:19:17.600,01:19:21.130
"3-- 3 times 2 over
2 is 3-- looks good.",01:19:21.130,01:19:26.340
"So now I've got a stronger
induction hypothesis.",01:19:26.340,01:19:28.430
"Not only is it
always the same, it",01:19:28.430,01:19:30.220
is that number is your score.,01:19:30.220,01:19:33.710
Let's see if that works.,01:19:33.710,01:19:35.190
Let's plug that in now.,01:19:35.190,01:19:38.000
"So base case--
let's check it out--",01:19:38.000,01:19:40.560
"is 1 times 1 minus
1 over 2 equal to 0.",01:19:40.560,01:19:47.520
Yes.,01:19:47.520,01:19:49.750
Let's plug it in here now.,01:19:49.750,01:19:53.040
"P of K would be now
K, K minus 1 over 2.",01:19:53.040,01:19:58.570
"This would be n plus 1 minus K,
n minus K over 2 plus this one",01:19:58.570,01:20:08.220
here.,01:20:08.220,01:20:08.720
"All right, I've got to add
all these things up, and see",01:20:12.140,01:20:15.850
"if it equals that
expression for n plus 1.",01:20:15.850,01:20:19.473
Let's do that.,01:20:19.473,01:20:20.435
"All right, I get 2 K n
plus 2 K minus 2 K squared.",01:20:23.330,01:20:29.780
"I'm putting all this over 2--
one giant mess over 2 here--",01:20:29.780,01:20:34.920
"plus K squared minus
K plus n squared.",01:20:34.920,01:20:43.120
"Well, let's write it just as
n plus 1 times n, minus K n,",01:20:43.120,01:20:52.940
"minus K, minus K n, all over 2.",01:20:52.940,01:20:57.860
And now let's cancel.,01:20:57.860,01:20:59.770
"Two K n's here cancel K n, K n.",01:20:59.770,01:21:04.420
"2K cancels K and K. 2K
squared minus 2 K squared",01:21:04.420,01:21:12.310
cancels K squared.,01:21:12.310,01:21:14.070
"And I forgot, plus K
squared from here and here.",01:21:14.070,01:21:20.970
"So I'm left with n
plus 1 times n over 2.",01:21:20.970,01:21:25.040
That is S n plus 1.,01:21:25.040,01:21:26.450
And the K disappears.,01:21:29.080,01:21:30.770
"We've established, now, the
stronger induction hypothesis.",01:21:30.770,01:21:34.740
"So not only did we prove
that every set of unstackings",01:21:34.740,01:21:38.980
gives you the same score.,01:21:38.980,01:21:40.960
"We proved the score is, for
n blocks, n times n minus 1",01:21:40.960,01:21:46.010
over 2.,01:21:46.010,01:21:46.570
"That's was pretty good
for strong induction.",01:21:49.787,01:21:51.620
"It lets you do some
pretty powerful things.",01:21:51.620,01:21:53.710
"OK, very good,
that's it for today.",01:21:53.710,01:21:56.820
