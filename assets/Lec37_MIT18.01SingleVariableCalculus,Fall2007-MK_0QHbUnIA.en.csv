"PROFESSOR: Today
we are continuing",00:00:21.344,00:00:22.760
with improper integrals.,00:00:22.760,00:00:24.730
"I still have a little bit
more to tell you about them.",00:00:24.730,00:00:27.371
"What we were discussing at
the very end of last time",00:00:30.080,00:00:33.510
was improper integrals.,00:00:33.510,00:00:36.195
"Now and these are going
to be improper integrals",00:00:41.560,00:00:44.570
of the second kind.,00:00:44.570,00:00:48.220
"By second kind I mean that
they have a singularity",00:00:48.220,00:00:50.990
at a finite place.,00:00:50.990,00:00:52.095
"That would be
something like this.",00:00:54.800,00:00:57.260
"So here's the
definition if you like.",00:00:57.260,00:01:00.140
"Same sort of thing as we
did when the singularity",00:01:00.140,00:01:03.380
was at infinity.,00:01:03.380,00:01:04.120
"So if you have the integral
from 0 to 1 of f(x).",00:01:04.120,00:01:09.440
"This is going to be the
same thing as the limit,",00:01:09.440,00:01:12.600
"as a goes to 0 from above,
the integral from a to 1",00:01:12.600,00:01:17.780
of f(x) dx.,00:01:17.780,00:01:21.150
"And the idea here is the same
one that we had at infinity.",00:01:21.150,00:01:25.920
Let me draw a picture of it.,00:01:25.920,00:01:27.320
"You have, imagine a function
which is coming down like this",00:01:27.320,00:01:30.030
and here's the point 1.,00:01:30.030,00:01:32.020
"And we don't know whether
the area enclosed is",00:01:32.020,00:01:35.180
"going to be infinite or
finite and so we cut it off",00:01:35.180,00:01:39.040
at some place a.,00:01:39.040,00:01:40.680
And we let a go to 0 from above.,00:01:40.680,00:01:44.220
So really it's 0+.,00:01:44.220,00:01:46.800
"So we're coming in
from the right here.",00:01:46.800,00:01:49.820
"And we're counting up
the area in this chunk.",00:01:49.820,00:01:52.810
"And we're seeing as it expands
whether it goes to infinity",00:01:52.810,00:01:56.520
"or whether it tends
to some finite limit.",00:01:56.520,00:01:59.290
"Right, so this is the example
and this is the definition.",00:01:59.290,00:02:02.990
"And just as we did for the
other kind of improper integral,",00:02:02.990,00:02:07.000
"we say that this converges --
so that's the key word here --",00:02:07.000,00:02:13.747
"if the limit is finite,
exists maybe I should just say",00:02:13.747,00:02:24.220
and diverges if not.,00:02:24.220,00:02:30.773
"Let's just take care
of the basic examples.",00:02:35.650,00:02:38.945
"First of all I wrote
this one down last time.",00:02:42.110,00:02:44.740
"We're going to
evaluate this one.",00:02:44.740,00:02:47.390
"The integral from 0 to 1 of
1 over the square root of x.",00:02:47.390,00:02:51.565
"And this just, you almost
don't notice the fact",00:02:55.402,00:02:57.360
that it goes to infinity.,00:02:57.360,00:02:59.920
"This goes to infinity
as x goes to 0.",00:02:59.920,00:03:02.570
"But if you evaluate it -- first
of all we always write this",00:03:02.570,00:03:05.860
as a power.,00:03:05.860,00:03:06.860
Right?,00:03:06.860,00:03:08.010
To get the evaluation.,00:03:08.010,00:03:09.870
"And then I'm not even going
to replace the 0 by an a.",00:03:09.870,00:03:13.060
I'm just going to leave it as 0.,00:03:13.060,00:03:14.490
"The antiderivative here
is x^(1/2) times 2.",00:03:14.490,00:03:18.660
"And then I evaluate
that at 0 and 1.",00:03:21.540,00:03:23.750
And I get 2.,00:03:23.750,00:03:25.080
"2 minus 0, which is 2.",00:03:25.080,00:03:29.090
"All right so this
one is convergent.",00:03:29.090,00:03:31.330
"And not only is it convergent
but we can evaluate it.",00:03:31.330,00:03:34.180
"The second example,
being not systematic",00:03:38.310,00:03:42.140
"but really giving you
the principal examples",00:03:42.140,00:03:44.300
"that we'll be thinking about,
is this one here, dx / x.",00:03:44.300,00:03:51.650
"And this one gives
you the antiderivative",00:03:51.650,00:03:54.200
as the logarithm.,00:03:54.200,00:03:56.070
Evaluated at 0 and 1.,00:03:56.070,00:03:58.180
"And now again you have
to have this thought",00:03:58.180,00:04:00.190
"process in your mind that
you're really taking the limit.",00:04:00.190,00:04:02.770
"But this is going to be the
log of 1 minus the log of 0.",00:04:02.770,00:04:06.440
Really the log of 0 from above.,00:04:06.440,00:04:07.830
"There is no such thing as
the log of 0 from below.",00:04:07.830,00:04:10.970
And this is minus infinity.,00:04:10.970,00:04:12.820
"So it's 0 minus minus infinity,
which is plus infinity.",00:04:12.820,00:04:19.020
And so this one diverges.,00:04:19.020,00:04:20.213
"All right so what's
the general--",00:04:29.710,00:04:32.750
"So more or less in general,
let's just, for powers anyway,",00:04:32.750,00:04:39.070
"if you work out this thing
for dx / x^p from 0 to 1.",00:04:39.070,00:04:45.220
"What you're going to find is
that it's 1/(1-p) when p is",00:04:45.220,00:04:51.820
less than 1.,00:04:51.820,00:04:53.020
And it diverges for p &gt;= 1.,00:04:53.020,00:05:00.240
"Now that's the final result. If
you carry out this integration",00:05:02.750,00:05:07.880
it's not difficult.,00:05:07.880,00:05:10.920
"All right so now
I just want to try",00:05:10.920,00:05:14.850
to help you to remember this.,00:05:14.850,00:05:17.270
"And to think about how
you should think about it.",00:05:17.270,00:05:20.500
"So I'm going to say
it in a few more ways.",00:05:20.500,00:05:23.890
"All right just repeat
what I've said already",00:05:23.890,00:05:26.850
"but try to get it to
percolate and absorb itself.",00:05:26.850,00:05:32.020
"And in order to do
that I have to make",00:05:32.020,00:05:34.270
"the contrast between the
kind of improper integral",00:05:34.270,00:05:37.750
that I was dealing with before.,00:05:37.750,00:05:39.410
"Which was not as x goes to 0
here but as x goes to infinity,",00:05:39.410,00:05:43.720
the other side.,00:05:43.720,00:05:45.920
Let's make this contrast.,00:05:45.920,00:05:47.023
"First of all, if I
look at the angle",00:05:52.470,00:05:55.610
"that we have been paying
attention to right now.",00:05:55.610,00:05:57.610
"We've just considered
things like this.",00:05:57.610,00:06:00.580
1 over x to the 1/2.,00:06:00.580,00:06:02.520
Which is a lot smaller than 1/x.,00:06:02.520,00:06:06.600
"Which is a lot smaller
than say 1/x^2.",00:06:06.600,00:06:10.740
Which would be another example.,00:06:10.740,00:06:12.050
This is as x goes to 0.,00:06:12.050,00:06:14.560
So this one's the smallest one.,00:06:19.990,00:06:21.935
"This one's the
next smallest one.",00:06:21.935,00:06:23.310
And this one is very large.,00:06:23.310,00:06:26.820
"On the other hand it goes
the other way at infinity.",00:06:26.820,00:06:30.985
As x tends to infinity.,00:06:36.670,00:06:39.936
"All right so try to
keep that in mind.",00:06:39.936,00:06:43.140
"And now I'm going to put a
little box around the bad guys",00:06:43.140,00:06:48.760
here.,00:06:48.760,00:06:50.100
This one is divergent.,00:06:50.100,00:06:54.710
And this one is divergent.,00:06:54.710,00:06:57.870
And this one is divergent.,00:06:57.870,00:06:59.950
And this one is divergent.,00:06:59.950,00:07:01.610
The crossover point is 1/x.,00:07:01.610,00:07:03.510
"When we get smaller
than that, we",00:07:03.510,00:07:05.680
"get to things which
are convergent.",00:07:05.680,00:07:07.390
"When we get smaller than
it on this other scale,",00:07:07.390,00:07:10.590
it's convergent.,00:07:10.590,00:07:12.412
"All right so these
guys are divergent.",00:07:12.412,00:07:13.995
"So they're associated
with divergent integrals.",00:07:20.300,00:07:23.430
"The functions
themselves are just",00:07:23.430,00:07:25.390
"tending towards-- well
these tend to infinity,",00:07:25.390,00:07:27.585
and these tend toward 0.,00:07:27.585,00:07:29.310
"So I'm not talking about
the functions themselves",00:07:29.310,00:07:33.830
but the integrals.,00:07:33.830,00:07:35.190
"Now I want to draw this
again here, not small enough.",00:07:35.190,00:07:40.040
I want to draw this again.,00:07:43.757,00:07:44.840
"And, so I'm just going
to draw a picture",00:07:48.484,00:07:50.150
of what it is that I have here.,00:07:50.150,00:07:51.760
"But I'm going to combine
these two pictures.",00:07:51.760,00:07:54.850
"So here's the picture
for example of y = 1/x.",00:07:54.850,00:08:01.330
All right.,00:08:04.714,00:08:06.700
That's y y = 1/x.,00:08:06.700,00:08:08.770
"And that picture
is very balanced.",00:08:08.770,00:08:10.470
It's symmetric on the two ends.,00:08:10.470,00:08:12.600
"If I cut it in half then what
I get here is two halves.",00:08:12.600,00:08:17.660
And this one has infinite area.,00:08:17.660,00:08:23.700
"That corresponds to the
integral from 1 to infinity,",00:08:23.700,00:08:27.730
dx / x being infinite.,00:08:27.730,00:08:30.530
"And the other piece, which --
this one we calculated last",00:08:30.530,00:08:34.810
"time, this is the one that
we just calculated over here",00:08:34.810,00:08:37.230
"at Example 2 -- has
the same property.",00:08:37.230,00:08:42.719
It's infinite.,00:08:42.719,00:08:45.720
"And that's the fact that the
integral from 0 to 1 of dx",00:08:45.720,00:08:48.102
/ x is infinite.,00:08:48.102,00:08:52.100
"Right, so both, we
lose on both ends.",00:08:52.100,00:08:56.570
"On the other hand if I
take something like --",00:08:56.570,00:09:02.390
"I'm drawing it the same way
but it's really not the same --",00:09:02.390,00:09:05.480
y = 1 over the square root of x.,00:09:05.480,00:09:08.490
y = 1 / x^(1/2).,00:09:08.490,00:09:11.010
"And if I cut that in half here
then the x^(1/2) is actually",00:09:11.010,00:09:17.980
bigger than this guy.,00:09:17.980,00:09:19.890
So this piece is infinite.,00:09:19.890,00:09:21.740
"And this part over
here actually is going",00:09:26.830,00:09:29.555
to give us an honest number.,00:09:29.555,00:09:31.310
In fact this one is finite.,00:09:31.310,00:09:34.810
"And we just checked
what the number is.",00:09:34.810,00:09:36.550
"It actually happens
to have area 2.",00:09:36.550,00:09:38.340
"And what's happening here
is if you would superimpose",00:09:46.250,00:09:49.210
"this graph on the
other graph what you",00:09:49.210,00:09:51.710
would see is that they cross.,00:09:51.710,00:09:54.580
And this one sits on top.,00:09:54.580,00:09:58.970
"So if I drew this one in
let's have another color here,",00:09:58.970,00:10:04.660
orange let's say.,00:10:04.660,00:10:05.840
"If this were orange if
I set it on top here",00:10:05.840,00:10:08.630
it would go this way.,00:10:08.630,00:10:11.130
"OK and underneath the
orange is still infinite.",00:10:11.130,00:10:14.790
So both of these are infinite.,00:10:14.790,00:10:16.070
"On here on the other hand
underneath the orange",00:10:16.070,00:10:18.028
"is infinite but underneath
where the green is is finite.",00:10:18.028,00:10:21.700
That's a smaller quantity.,00:10:21.700,00:10:23.770
Infinity is a lot bigger than 2.,00:10:23.770,00:10:25.290
2 is a lot less than infinity.,00:10:25.290,00:10:27.826
"All right so that's reflected
in these comparisons here.",00:10:27.826,00:10:30.835
"Now if you like if I want
to do these in green.",00:10:30.835,00:10:33.610
"This guy is good and
this guy is good.",00:10:33.610,00:10:39.900
"Well let me just repeat that
idea over here in this sort",00:10:39.900,00:10:42.960
"of reversed picture
with y = 1/x^2.",00:10:42.960,00:10:47.930
"If I chop that in half then
the good part is this end here.",00:10:47.930,00:10:53.640
This is finite.,00:10:53.640,00:10:54.440
"And the bad part is
this part of here",00:10:56.990,00:10:59.570
which is way more singular.,00:10:59.570,00:11:01.310
And it's infinite.,00:11:01.310,00:11:02.060
"All right so again what
I've just tried to do",00:11:07.070,00:11:10.080
"is to give you some
geometric sense and also",00:11:10.080,00:11:16.710
some visceral sense.,00:11:16.710,00:11:18.580
"This guy, its tail as it goes
out to infinity is much lower.",00:11:18.580,00:11:23.040
It's much smaller than 1/x.,00:11:23.040,00:11:25.470
"And these guys trapped an
infinite amount of area.",00:11:25.470,00:11:28.080
"This one traps only a
finite amount of area.",00:11:28.080,00:11:30.110
"All right so now I'm
just going to give one",00:11:36.676,00:11:38.860
"last example which combines
these two types of pictures.",00:11:38.860,00:11:43.090
"It's really practically
the same as what",00:11:43.090,00:11:45.420
"I've said before but I-- oh
have to erase this one too.",00:11:45.420,00:11:53.320
"So here's another example:
if you're in-- So let's",00:12:01.340,00:12:05.770
take the following example.,00:12:05.770,00:12:08.132
"This is somewhat
related to the first one",00:12:08.132,00:12:09.840
that I gave last time.,00:12:09.840,00:12:11.600
"If you take a function
y = 1/(x-3)^2.",00:12:11.600,00:12:16.090
"And you think
about its integral.",00:12:18.770,00:12:21.160
"So let's think about the
integral from 0 to infinity,",00:12:21.160,00:12:24.750
dx / (x-3)^2.,00:12:24.750,00:12:27.090
"And suppose you were
faced with this integral.",00:12:27.090,00:12:30.420
"In order to understand
what it's doing",00:12:30.420,00:12:32.630
"you have to pay attention to two
places where it can go wrong.",00:12:32.630,00:12:36.310
"We're going to split
into two pieces.",00:12:36.310,00:12:39.530
"I'm going say break it up
into this one here up to 5,",00:12:39.530,00:12:44.349
for the sake of argument.,00:12:44.349,00:12:45.390
And say from 5 to infinity.,00:12:48.090,00:12:49.715
All right.,00:12:53.672,00:12:54.960
So these are the two chunks.,00:12:54.960,00:12:56.260
"Now why did I break it
up into those two pieces?",00:12:56.260,00:12:58.810
"Because what's happening
with this function",00:12:58.810,00:13:00.670
"is that it's going
up like this at 3.",00:13:00.670,00:13:05.250
"And so if I look at
the two halves here.",00:13:05.250,00:13:08.210
"I'm going to draw
them again and I'm",00:13:08.210,00:13:09.710
"going to illustrate them
with the colors we've chosen,",00:13:09.710,00:13:12.560
which are I guess red and green.,00:13:12.560,00:13:15.350
"What you'll discover
is that this one",00:13:15.350,00:13:20.660
"here, which corresponds to
this piece here, is infinite.",00:13:20.660,00:13:30.540
"And it's infinite
because there's",00:13:30.540,00:13:32.320
a square in the denominator.,00:13:32.320,00:13:34.270
"And as x goes to 3 this
is very much like if we",00:13:34.270,00:13:39.190
shifted the 3 to 0.,00:13:39.190,00:13:40.670
Very much like this 1/x^2 here.,00:13:40.670,00:13:42.560
But not in this context.,00:13:42.560,00:13:44.247
"In the other context where
it's going to infinity.",00:13:44.247,00:13:46.330
"This is the same
as at the picture",00:13:49.460,00:13:52.360
"directly above with the
infinite part in red.",00:13:52.360,00:13:57.398
All right.,00:13:57.398,00:13:59.650
"And this part here,
this part is finite.",00:13:59.650,00:14:04.915
All right.,00:14:04.915,00:14:06.240
"So since we have an infinite
part plus a finite part",00:14:06.240,00:14:08.960
"the conclusion is that this
thing, well this guy converges.",00:14:08.960,00:14:15.070
And this one diverges.,00:14:15.070,00:14:18.850
"But the total
unfortunately diverges.",00:14:21.470,00:14:23.930
"Right, because it's
got one infinity in it.",00:14:23.930,00:14:25.760
So this thing diverges.,00:14:25.760,00:14:28.370
"And that's what
happened last time",00:14:31.964,00:14:33.380
when we got a crazy number.,00:14:33.380,00:14:34.870
"If you integrated this you
would get some negative number.",00:14:34.870,00:14:37.480
"If you wrote down the
formulas carelessly.",00:14:37.480,00:14:39.850
"And the reason is that
the calculation actually",00:14:39.850,00:14:42.250
is nonsense.,00:14:42.250,00:14:44.710
"So you've gotta be
aware, if you encounter",00:14:44.710,00:14:47.890
"a singularity in the
middle, not to ignore it.",00:14:47.890,00:14:51.600
Yeah.,00:14:51.600,00:14:52.100
Question.,00:14:52.100,00:14:52.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE],00:14:52.620,00:14:53.786
"PROFESSOR: Why do we say that
the whole thing diverges?",00:14:56.430,00:14:59.710
"The reason why we say that is
the area under the whole curve",00:14:59.710,00:15:02.490
is infinite.,00:15:02.490,00:15:03.690
"It's the sum of this
piece plus this piece.",00:15:03.690,00:15:06.130
And so the total is infinite.,00:15:06.130,00:15:08.218
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE],00:15:08.218,00:15:09.384
PROFESSOR: We're stuck.,00:15:17.032,00:15:17.990
This is an ill-defined integral.,00:15:17.990,00:15:19.323
"It's one where your red flashing
warning sign should be on.",00:15:19.323,00:15:22.092
"Because you're not
going to get the right",00:15:22.092,00:15:23.800
answer by computing it.,00:15:23.800,00:15:24.758
You'll never get an answer.,00:15:24.758,00:15:26.860
"Similarly you'll never
get an answer with this.",00:15:26.860,00:15:29.230
"And you will get an
answer with that.",00:15:29.230,00:15:32.700
OK?,00:15:32.700,00:15:33.200
Yeah another question.,00:15:37.220,00:15:38.944
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE],00:15:38.944,00:15:40.110
"PROFESSOR: So the
question is, if you",00:15:45.760,00:15:47.690
"have a little glance
at an integral,",00:15:47.690,00:15:50.010
"how are you going to decide
where you should be heading?",00:15:50.010,00:15:54.750
"So I'm going to
answer that orally.",00:15:54.750,00:15:58.280
"Although you know, but I'll
say one little hint here.",00:15:58.280,00:16:04.010
"So you always have to check
x going to infinity and x",00:16:04.010,00:16:08.070
"going to minus infinity,
if they're in there.",00:16:08.070,00:16:10.740
"And you also have to check any
singularity, like x going to 3",00:16:10.740,00:16:15.460
for sure in this case.,00:16:15.460,00:16:16.419
"You have to pay attention
to all the places",00:16:16.419,00:16:18.210
where the thing is infinite.,00:16:18.210,00:16:19.376
"And then you want to focus
in on each one separately.",00:16:19.376,00:16:22.330
"And decide what's going on
it at that particular place.",00:16:22.330,00:16:26.920
"When it's a negative power-- So
remember dx / x as x goes to 0",00:16:26.920,00:16:34.530
is bad.,00:16:34.530,00:16:36.980
And dx / x^2 is bad.,00:16:36.980,00:16:39.510
dx / x^3 is bad.,00:16:39.510,00:16:40.490
All of them are even worse.,00:16:40.490,00:16:42.600
"So anything of this form
is bad: n = 1, 2, 3.",00:16:42.600,00:16:49.650
These are the red box kinds.,00:16:49.650,00:16:51.980
All right.,00:16:51.980,00:16:55.030
"That means that any
of the integrals",00:16:55.030,00:16:56.940
"that we did in partial
fractions which",00:16:56.940,00:16:59.990
"had a root, which had
a factor of something",00:16:59.990,00:17:02.080
in the denominator.,00:17:02.080,00:17:03.160
"Those are all
divergent integrals",00:17:03.160,00:17:04.790
if you cross the singularly.,00:17:04.790,00:17:06.670
"Not a single one of them makes
sense across the singularity.",00:17:06.670,00:17:09.357
Right?,00:17:09.357,00:17:09.856
"If you have square
roots and things",00:17:12.692,00:17:14.150
"like that then you can
repair things like that.",00:17:14.150,00:17:16.108
"And there's some interesting
examples of that.",00:17:16.108,00:17:18.030
"Such as with the arcsine
function and so forth.",00:17:18.030,00:17:21.080
"Where you have an improper
integral which is really OK.",00:17:21.080,00:17:25.940
All right.,00:17:25.940,00:17:26.730
So that's the best I can do.,00:17:26.730,00:17:29.880
"It's obviously something
you get experience with.",00:17:29.880,00:17:32.260
All right.,00:17:32.260,00:17:34.110
"Now I'm going to move on
and this is more or less",00:17:34.110,00:17:39.350
our last topic.,00:17:39.350,00:17:42.150
"Yay, but not quite.",00:17:42.150,00:17:43.900
"Well, so I should say it's
our penultimate topic.",00:17:43.900,00:17:46.730
"Right because we have
one more lecture.",00:17:46.730,00:17:49.430
All right.,00:17:49.430,00:17:52.010
"So that our next
topic is series.",00:17:52.010,00:17:54.750
"Now we'll do it in a sort
of a concrete way today.",00:17:54.750,00:17:58.810
"And then we'll do what are
known as power series tomorrow.",00:17:58.810,00:18:02.775
So let me tell you about series.,00:18:05.400,00:18:06.760
"Remember we're
talking about infinity",00:18:20.490,00:18:22.604
and dealing with infinity.,00:18:22.604,00:18:23.687
"So we're not just talking
about any old series.",00:18:26.772,00:18:28.730
"We're talking about
infinite series.",00:18:28.730,00:18:30.230
"There is one infinite
series which is probably,",00:18:32.650,00:18:37.400
"which is without
question the most",00:18:37.400,00:18:39.000
important and useful series.,00:18:39.000,00:18:41.980
"And that's the
geometric series but I'm",00:18:41.980,00:18:44.690
"going to introduce it concretely
first in a particular case.",00:18:44.690,00:18:48.405
If I draw a picture of this sum.,00:18:51.990,00:18:54.260
"Which in principle
goes on forever.",00:18:54.260,00:18:56.480
"You can see that it goes
someplace fairly easily",00:18:56.480,00:18:59.670
"by marking out what's
happening on the number line.",00:18:59.670,00:19:02.730
"The first step takes
us to 1 from 0.",00:19:02.730,00:19:06.630
"And then if I add this
half, I get to 3/2.",00:19:06.630,00:19:11.790
"Right, so the first step was
1 and the second step was 1/2.",00:19:11.790,00:19:16.240
"Now if I add this quarter in,
which is the next piece then",00:19:16.240,00:19:20.940
I get some place here.,00:19:20.940,00:19:22.400
"But what I want to
observe is that I got,",00:19:22.400,00:19:28.440
"I can look at it from
the other point of view.",00:19:28.440,00:19:31.130
"I got, when I move this quarter
I got half way to 2 here.",00:19:31.130,00:19:36.240
"I'm putting 2 in green
because I want you to think",00:19:36.240,00:19:39.420
of it as being the good kind.,00:19:39.420,00:19:42.950
Right.,00:19:42.950,00:19:43.970
The kind that has a number.,00:19:43.970,00:19:45.420
And not one of the red kinds.,00:19:45.420,00:19:47.280
"We're getting there
and we're almost there.",00:19:47.280,00:19:49.920
"So the next stage we
get half way again.",00:19:49.920,00:19:52.620
That's the eighth and so forth.,00:19:52.620,00:19:54.605
And eventually we get to 2.,00:19:54.605,00:19:56.490
So this sum we write equals two.,00:19:56.490,00:20:00.476
"All right that's
kind of a paradox",00:20:00.476,00:20:02.590
because we never get to 2.,00:20:02.590,00:20:04.130
"This is the paradox
that Zeno fussed with.",00:20:04.130,00:20:08.080
"And his conclusion, you know,
with the rabbit and the hare.",00:20:08.080,00:20:12.807
"No, the rabbit and the tortoise.",00:20:12.807,00:20:14.140
"Sorry hare chasing-- anyway,
the rabbit chasing the tortoise.",00:20:14.140,00:20:18.890
"His conclusion--
you know, I don't",00:20:18.890,00:20:21.050
"know if you're aware of this,
but he understood this paradox.",00:20:21.050,00:20:23.770
"And he said you know it
doesn't look like it ever",00:20:23.770,00:20:25.811
"gets there because they're
infinitely many times",00:20:25.811,00:20:29.180
"between the time-- you know that
the tortoise is always behind,",00:20:29.180,00:20:32.330
"always behind, always
behind, always behind.",00:20:32.330,00:20:34.580
"So therefore it's
impossible that the tortoise",00:20:34.580,00:20:36.970
catches up right.,00:20:36.970,00:20:38.710
"So do you know what
his conclusion was?",00:20:38.710,00:20:41.600
Time does not exist.,00:20:41.600,00:20:45.280
"That was actually
literally his conclusion.",00:20:45.280,00:20:48.007
"Because he didn't
understand the possibility",00:20:48.007,00:20:49.840
of a continuum of time.,00:20:49.840,00:20:50.799
"Because there were infinitely
many things that happened",00:20:50.799,00:20:53.090
before the tortoise caught up.,00:20:53.090,00:20:56.610
So that was the reasoning.,00:20:56.610,00:20:57.790
"I mean it's a long time ago
but you know people didn't-- he",00:20:57.790,00:21:00.430
didn't believe in continuum.,00:21:00.430,00:21:02.430
All right.,00:21:02.430,00:21:03.480
So anyway that's a small point.,00:21:03.480,00:21:06.940
"Now the general case here
of a geometric series",00:21:06.940,00:21:19.410
"is where I put in a number
a instead of 1/2 here.",00:21:19.410,00:21:22.820
So what we had before.,00:21:22.820,00:21:23.870
So that's 1 + a + a^2...,00:21:23.870,00:21:26.890
"Isn't quite the most general
but anyway I'll write this down.",00:21:26.890,00:21:31.900
"And you're certainly going
to want to remember that",00:21:31.900,00:21:34.630
"the formula for this in
the limit is 1/(1-a).",00:21:34.630,00:21:39.510
"And I remind you that this only
works when the absolute value",00:21:39.510,00:21:44.000
is strictly less than 1.,00:21:44.000,00:21:45.810
"In other words when -1
is strictly less than a",00:21:45.810,00:21:47.970
is less than 1.,00:21:47.970,00:21:51.130
"And that's really the
issue that we're going",00:21:51.130,00:21:53.090
to want to worry about now.,00:21:53.090,00:21:54.310
"What we're worrying about is
this notion of convergence.",00:21:54.310,00:21:58.270
"And what goes wrong when
there isn't convergence,",00:21:58.270,00:22:05.300
when there's a divergence.,00:22:05.300,00:22:07.360
"So let me illustrate the
divergences before going on.",00:22:07.360,00:22:13.220
"And this is what we
have to avoid if we're",00:22:13.220,00:22:15.900
going to understand series.,00:22:15.900,00:22:18.990
So here's an example when a = 1.,00:22:18.990,00:22:21.890
"You get 1 + 1 +
1 plus et cetera.",00:22:21.890,00:22:26.620
And that's equal to 1/(1-1).,00:22:26.620,00:22:29.990
Which is 1 over 0.,00:22:29.990,00:22:32.370
So this is not bad.,00:22:32.370,00:22:33.760
It's almost right.,00:22:33.760,00:22:34.861
Right?,00:22:34.861,00:22:35.360
"It's sort of infinity
equals infinity.",00:22:35.360,00:22:37.750
"At the edge here we
managed to get something",00:22:37.750,00:22:39.850
which is sort of almost right.,00:22:39.850,00:22:42.340
"But you know, it's, we don't
consider this to be logically",00:22:42.340,00:22:46.100
to make complete sense.,00:22:46.100,00:22:47.540
So it's a little dangerous.,00:22:47.540,00:22:51.200
"And so we just say
that it diverges.",00:22:51.200,00:22:52.960
And we get rid of this.,00:22:52.960,00:22:54.100
"So we're still
putting it in red.",00:22:54.100,00:22:55.990
All right.,00:22:55.990,00:22:58.540
The bad guy here.,00:22:58.540,00:22:59.975
So this one diverges.,00:22:59.975,00:23:00.850
"Similarly if I take a equals
-1, I get 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1...",00:23:04.670,00:23:12.650
"Because the odd and the
even powers in that formula",00:23:12.650,00:23:15.450
alternate sign.,00:23:15.450,00:23:17.270
And this bounces back and forth.,00:23:17.270,00:23:19.750
It never settles down.,00:23:19.750,00:23:21.640
It starts at 1.,00:23:21.640,00:23:23.346
"And then it gets down to 0
and then it goes back up to 1,",00:23:23.346,00:23:25.720
"down to 0, back up to 1.",00:23:25.720,00:23:28.400
It doesn't settle down.,00:23:28.400,00:23:29.517
It bounces back and forth.,00:23:29.517,00:23:30.600
It oscillates.,00:23:30.600,00:23:31.580
"On the other hand if you
compare the right hand side.",00:23:31.580,00:23:34.740
What's the right hand side?,00:23:34.740,00:23:35.980
It's 1 / (1-(-1)).,00:23:35.980,00:23:36.970
Which is 1/2.,00:23:39.730,00:23:41.515
All right.,00:23:41.515,00:23:42.460
"So if you just paid attention
to the formula, which",00:23:42.460,00:23:45.169
"is what we were doing when we
integrated without thinking too",00:23:45.169,00:23:47.710
"hard about this,
you get a number",00:23:47.710,00:23:50.070
here but in fact that's wrong.,00:23:50.070,00:23:51.320
"Actually it's kind of
an interesting number.",00:23:51.320,00:23:53.153
"It's halfway between the
two, between 0 and 1.",00:23:53.153,00:23:56.380
"So again there's some
sort of vague sense",00:23:56.380,00:23:58.505
"in which this is trying
to be this answer.",00:23:58.505,00:24:01.966
All right.,00:24:01.966,00:24:04.580
"It's not so bad but we're still
going to put this in a red box.",00:24:04.580,00:24:08.744
All right.,00:24:08.744,00:24:10.030
"because this is what
we called divergence.",00:24:10.030,00:24:12.710
"So both of these
cases are divergent.",00:24:12.710,00:24:16.130
"It only really works when
alpha-- when a is less than 1.",00:24:16.130,00:24:20.490
"I'm going to add
one more case just",00:24:20.490,00:24:23.480
"to see that mathematicians are
slightly curious about what",00:24:23.480,00:24:30.040
goes on in other cases.,00:24:30.040,00:24:32.020
"So this is 1 + 2 +
2^2 + 2^3 plus etc..",00:24:32.020,00:24:37.570
"And that should be equal to --
according to this formula --",00:24:37.570,00:24:41.980
1/(1-2).,00:24:41.980,00:24:44.750
Which is -1.,00:24:44.750,00:24:48.242
All right.,00:24:48.242,00:24:49.860
"Now this one is
clearly wrong, right?",00:24:49.860,00:24:53.460
This one is totally wrong.,00:24:53.460,00:24:55.530
It certainly diverges.,00:24:58.170,00:24:59.465
"The left hand side is
obviously infinite.",00:24:59.465,00:25:02.370
The right hand side is way off.,00:25:02.370,00:25:04.070
It's -1.,00:25:04.070,00:25:05.960
"On the other hand it
turns out actually",00:25:05.960,00:25:10.350
"that mathematicians have ways
of making sense out of these.",00:25:10.350,00:25:13.360
"In number theory
there's a strange system",00:25:13.360,00:25:15.590
where this is actually true.,00:25:15.590,00:25:18.160
"And what happens
in that system is",00:25:18.160,00:25:21.530
"that what you have to
throw out is the idea",00:25:21.530,00:25:24.030
that 0 is less than 1.,00:25:24.030,00:25:27.050
"There is no such thing
as negative numbers.",00:25:27.050,00:25:29.980
So this number exists.,00:25:29.980,00:25:32.090
"And it's the additive
inverse of 1.",00:25:32.090,00:25:35.700
"It has this arithmetic
property but the statement",00:25:35.700,00:25:39.780
"that this is, that 1 is bigger
than 0 does not make sense.",00:25:39.780,00:25:43.330
"So you have your choice,
either this diverges",00:25:43.330,00:25:45.440
"or you have to throw
out something like this.",00:25:45.440,00:25:48.630
"So that's a very curious
thing in higher mathematics.",00:25:48.630,00:25:51.510
"Which if you get to number
theory there's fun stuff there.",00:25:51.510,00:25:56.410

"OK but for our purposes
these things are all out.",00:25:58.920,00:26:02.740
All right.,00:26:02.740,00:26:03.300
They're gone.,00:26:03.300,00:26:04.010
We're not considering them.,00:26:04.010,00:26:05.160
Only a between -1 and 1.,00:26:05.160,00:26:09.550
All right.,00:26:09.550,00:26:10.070
"Now I want to do
something systematic.",00:26:13.910,00:26:18.190

the lines of the powers",00:26:18.190,00:26:21.530

kind of borderline convergent.,00:26:28.590,00:26:30.420
"And then next time when we
talk about powers series we'll",00:26:30.420,00:26:33.720
"come back to this very
important series which",00:26:33.720,00:26:35.810
is the most important one.,00:26:35.810,00:26:37.080
"So now let's talk about some
series-- er, general notations.",00:26:40.680,00:26:47.400
"And this will help
you with the last bit.",00:26:47.400,00:26:49.970
"This is going to be pretty
much the same as what",00:26:53.810,00:26:56.760
we did for improper integrals.,00:26:56.760,00:27:00.890
"Namely, first of all I'm
going to have S_N which",00:27:00.890,00:27:04.320
"is the sum of a_n, n
equals 0 to capital N.",00:27:04.320,00:27:09.760
"And this is what we're
calling a partial sum.",00:27:09.760,00:27:12.220
"And then the full limit, which
is capital S, if you like.",00:27:18.050,00:27:23.980
"a_n, n equals 0 to infinity,
is just the limit as N goes",00:27:23.980,00:27:29.980
to infinity of the S_N's.,00:27:29.980,00:27:32.010
"And then we have the same kind
of notation that we had before.",00:27:36.240,00:27:39.770
"Which is there are
these two choices which",00:27:39.770,00:27:42.860
is that if the limit exists.,00:27:42.860,00:27:45.890
That's the green choice.,00:27:50.450,00:27:51.830
And we say it converges.,00:27:51.830,00:27:54.460
So we say the series converges.,00:27:54.460,00:28:00.830
"And then the other case which
is the limit does not exist.",00:28:00.830,00:28:06.616
"And we can say the
series diverges.",00:28:10.782,00:28:12.240

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE],00:28:21.343,00:28:22.509
"PROFESSOR: The question
was how did I get to this?",00:28:26.480,00:28:29.290
"And I will do that next
time but in fact of course",00:28:29.290,00:28:31.840
you've seen it in high school.,00:28:31.840,00:28:33.240
Right this is-- Yeah.,00:28:33.240,00:28:35.930
Yeah.,00:28:35.930,00:28:36.860
We'll do that next time.,00:28:36.860,00:28:40.000
"The question was how
did we arrive-- sorry I",00:28:40.000,00:28:42.222
didn't tell you the question.,00:28:42.222,00:28:43.430

how do we arrive",00:28:43.430,00:28:44.360
"at this formula on the
right hand side here.",00:28:44.360,00:28:46.590
"But we'll talk about
that next time.",00:28:46.590,00:28:48.240
All right.,00:28:53.060,00:28:54.020
"So here's the basic
definition and what",00:28:54.020,00:28:59.930
"we're going to
recognize about series.",00:28:59.930,00:29:02.430
"And I'm going to give
you a few examples",00:29:02.430,00:29:06.835
"and then we'll do
something systematic.",00:29:06.835,00:29:08.460
"So the first example--
well the first example",00:29:12.070,00:29:14.495
is the geometric series.,00:29:14.495,00:29:16.290
"But the first example that
I'm going to discuss now",00:29:16.290,00:29:19.430
"and in a little bit of
detail is this sum 1/n^2,",00:29:19.430,00:29:23.352
n equals 1 to infinity.,00:29:23.352,00:29:24.310
"It turns out that this
series is very analogous --",00:29:28.580,00:29:34.050
"and we'll develop this
analogy carefully --",00:29:34.050,00:29:36.690
"the integral from
1 to x, dx / x^2.",00:29:36.690,00:29:41.065
"And we're going to develop
this analogy in detail later",00:29:41.065,00:29:46.220
in this lecture.,00:29:46.220,00:29:47.920
"And this one is
one of the ones--",00:29:47.920,00:29:49.770
"so now you have to go back
and actually remember,",00:29:49.770,00:29:51.890
"this is one of the ones you
really want to memorize.",00:29:51.890,00:29:54.335
"And you should especially
pay attention to the ones",00:29:54.335,00:29:56.460
with an infinity in them.,00:29:56.460,00:29:58.507
This one is convergent.,00:29:58.507,00:29:59.465
And this series is convergent.,00:30:03.270,00:30:04.520
"Now it turns out that
evaluating this is very easy.",00:30:04.520,00:30:11.070
This is 1.,00:30:11.070,00:30:12.820
It's easy to calculate.,00:30:12.820,00:30:15.310
Evaluating this is very tricky.,00:30:15.310,00:30:19.500
And Euler did it.,00:30:19.500,00:30:21.610
And the answer is pi^2 / 6.,00:30:21.610,00:30:26.440
That's an amazing calculation.,00:30:26.440,00:30:29.050
"And it was done very early in
the history of mathematics.",00:30:29.050,00:30:33.570
"If you look at another example--
so maybe example two here,",00:30:33.570,00:30:38.110
"if you look at 1/n^3, n equals--
well you can't start here at 0",00:30:38.110,00:30:45.790

I want in these series.",00:30:46.580,00:30:48.930

Here I started with 1.,00:30:49.920,00:30:51.220
"And notice the reason
why I started--",00:30:51.220,00:30:52.880
"it was a bad idea to start
with 0 was that 1 over 0",00:30:52.880,00:30:56.650
is undefined.,00:30:56.650,00:30:57.860
Right?,00:30:57.860,00:30:58.360
"So I'm just starting where
it's convenient for me.",00:30:58.360,00:31:00.443
"And since I'm interested
mostly in the tail behavior",00:31:00.443,00:31:03.560
"it doesn't matter to me
so much where I start.",00:31:03.560,00:31:06.150
"Although if I want
an exact answer",00:31:06.150,00:31:07.800
"I need to start
exactly at n = 1.",00:31:07.800,00:31:10.165
All right.,00:31:10.165,00:31:10.890
"This one is similar
to this integral here.",00:31:10.890,00:31:17.932
All right.,00:31:17.932,00:31:18.700
Which is convergent again.,00:31:18.700,00:31:20.440
"So there's a number
that you get.",00:31:20.440,00:31:22.390
"And let's see what is it
something like 2/3 or something",00:31:22.390,00:31:27.180
"like that, all right,
for this for this number.",00:31:27.180,00:31:30.190
Or 1/3.,00:31:30.190,00:31:32.440
What is it?,00:31:32.440,00:31:33.110
No 1/2.,00:31:33.110,00:31:33.690
I guess it's 1/2.,00:31:33.690,00:31:35.000
This one is 1/2.,00:31:35.000,00:31:37.110

I'm not positive,",00:31:37.110,00:31:38.780

it in my head quickly",00:31:38.780,00:31:40.600

number to calculate.",00:31:42.150,00:31:44.100

elementary form like this.",00:31:51.870,00:31:56.250

proved to be rational.",00:31:56.250,00:31:59.842

rational number or not.",00:32:01.550,00:32:05.260

it is an irrational number",00:32:05.260,00:32:07.830

of reasoning applies",00:34:47.390,00:34:49.890
to these other examples.,00:34:49.890,00:34:51.275
So here we go.,00:34:55.820,00:34:59.180
"I'm going to take
the integral and draw",00:34:59.180,00:35:04.290
the picture of the Riemann sum.,00:35:04.290,00:35:07.220
"So here's the level 1 and
here's the function y = 1/x.",00:35:07.220,00:35:13.840
"And I'm going to
take the Riemann sum.",00:35:13.840,00:35:15.730
With delta x = 1.,00:35:21.980,00:35:25.200
"And that's going to be closely
connected to the series",00:35:25.200,00:35:28.820
that I have.,00:35:28.820,00:35:29.570
"But now I have to decide
whether I want a lower Riemann",00:35:32.160,00:35:35.670
sum or an upper Riemann sum.,00:35:35.670,00:35:37.797
"And actually I'm going
to check both of them",00:35:37.797,00:35:39.630
"because both of them
are illuminating.",00:35:39.630,00:35:41.213
"First we'll do the
upper Riemann's sum.",00:35:44.620,00:35:47.000
Now that's this staircase here.,00:35:47.000,00:35:48.700
"So we'll call this the
upper Riemann's sum.",00:35:51.780,00:35:54.600
"And let's check
what its levels are.",00:35:58.130,00:35:59.710
This is not to scale.,00:35:59.710,00:36:01.560
This level should be 1/2.,00:36:01.560,00:36:03.250
"So if this is 1 and
this is 2 and that level",00:36:03.250,00:36:05.245
"was supposed to be 1/2 and
this next level should be 1/3.",00:36:05.245,00:36:10.340
"That's how the Riemann
sums are working out.",00:36:10.340,00:36:12.830
"And now I have the
following phenomenon.",00:36:17.040,00:36:21.770
"Let's cut it off
at the nth stage.",00:36:21.770,00:36:24.640
"So that means that I'm
going, the integral",00:36:24.640,00:36:27.095
"is from 1 to n, dx / x.",00:36:27.095,00:36:30.760
"And the Riemann sum is
something that's bigger than it.",00:36:30.760,00:36:33.690
"Because the areas are enclosing
the area of the curved region.",00:36:33.690,00:36:40.300
"And that's going to be the
area of the first box which",00:36:40.300,00:36:43.510
"is 1, plus the area of the
second box which is 1/2,",00:36:43.510,00:36:50.330
"plus the area of the
third box which is 1/3.",00:36:50.330,00:36:54.150
"All the way up the last one,
but the last one starts at N-1.",00:36:54.150,00:37:00.840
So it has 1/(N-1).,00:37:00.840,00:37:03.450
There are not N boxes here.,00:37:03.450,00:37:05.780
There are only N-1 boxes.,00:37:05.780,00:37:07.960
"Because the distance
between 1 and N is N-1.",00:37:07.960,00:37:11.830
Right so this is N-1 terms.,00:37:11.830,00:37:13.555
"However, if I use the
notation for partial sum.",00:37:17.330,00:37:25.140
"Which is 1 + 1/2 plus all the
way up to 1/(n-1) 1 + 1/n.",00:37:25.140,00:37:33.367
"In other words I go out
to the Nth one which",00:37:33.367,00:37:35.200
is what I would ordinarily do.,00:37:35.200,00:37:37.370
"Then this sum that I have here
certainly is less than S_N.",00:37:37.370,00:37:42.900
"Because there's one
more term there.",00:37:42.900,00:37:47.850
"And so here I have
an integral which",00:37:47.850,00:37:50.430
is underneath this sum S_N.,00:37:50.430,00:37:53.570
"Now this is going to allow
us to prove conclusively",00:38:01.700,00:38:19.031
"that the-- So I'm just
going to rewrite this, prove",00:38:19.031,00:38:21.156
"conclusively that
the sum diverges.",00:38:21.156,00:38:22.614
Why is that?,00:38:22.614,00:38:23.340
"Because this term
here we can calculate.",00:38:23.340,00:38:26.000
"This is log x
evaluated at 1 and n.",00:38:26.000,00:38:29.470
"Which is the same
thing as log N minus 0.",00:38:29.470,00:38:34.850
"All right, the quantity
log N - log 1 which is 0.",00:38:34.850,00:38:39.270
"And so what we have here is
that log N is less than S_N.",00:38:39.270,00:38:46.892
"All right and clearly this
goes to infinity right.",00:38:46.892,00:38:51.455
"As N goes to infinity this
thing goes to infinity.",00:38:51.455,00:38:57.830
So we're done.,00:38:57.830,00:38:58.435
"All right we've
shown divergence.",00:38:58.435,00:39:00.330
"Now the way I'm going to
use the lower Riemann's sum",00:39:08.730,00:39:15.040
"is to recognize
that we've captured",00:39:15.040,00:39:20.010
the rate appropriately.,00:39:20.010,00:39:21.960
"That is not only do I have
a lower bound like this",00:39:21.960,00:39:24.400
"but I have an upper bound
which is very similar.",00:39:24.400,00:39:27.860
"So if I use the upper
Riemann-- oh sorry,",00:39:27.860,00:39:30.440
"lower Riemann sum
again with delta x = 1.",00:39:30.440,00:39:39.540
"Then I have that the
integral from 1 to n of dx",00:39:43.760,00:39:53.946
"/ x is bigger than-- Well
what are the terms going",00:39:53.946,00:39:57.970
to be if fit them underneath?,00:39:57.970,00:40:00.640
"If I fit them underneath
I'm missing the first term.",00:40:00.640,00:40:03.210
"That is the box is
going to be half height.",00:40:03.210,00:40:05.600
"It's going to be
this lower piece.",00:40:05.600,00:40:08.300
So I'm missing this first term.,00:40:08.300,00:40:10.480
So it'll be a 1/2 + 1/3 plus...,00:40:10.480,00:40:16.765
"All right, it will
keep on going.",00:40:16.765,00:40:18.150
"But now the last one
instead of being 1/(N-1),",00:40:18.150,00:40:22.150
"it's going to be 1 over N. This
is again a total of the N-1",00:40:22.150,00:40:25.850
terms.,00:40:25.850,00:40:27.050
This is the lower Riemann sum.,00:40:27.050,00:40:28.430
"And now we can recognize that
this is exactly equal to-- well",00:40:31.190,00:40:38.808
"so I'll put it over
here-- this is exactly",00:40:38.808,00:40:40.558
"equal to S_N minus 1,
minus the first term.",00:40:40.558,00:40:43.520
"So we missed the first term but
we got all the rest of them.",00:40:43.520,00:40:47.110
"So if I put this
to the other side",00:40:47.110,00:40:49.360
"remember this is
log N. All right.",00:40:49.360,00:40:53.746
"If I put this to
the other side I",00:40:53.746,00:40:55.120
"have the other
side of this bound.",00:40:55.120,00:40:57.130
"I have that S S_N is less than,
if I reverse it, log N + 1.",00:40:57.130,00:41:07.010
"And so I've trapped
it on the other side.",00:41:07.010,00:41:09.040
And here I have the lower bound.,00:41:09.040,00:41:10.950
"So I'm going to
combine those together.",00:41:10.950,00:41:13.170
"So all told I have this
correspondence here.",00:41:13.170,00:41:18.030
"It is the size of log N is
trapped between the-- sorry,",00:41:18.030,00:41:23.150
"the size of S_N, which is
relatively hard to calculate",00:41:23.150,00:41:26.150
"and understand exactly,
is trapped between log N",00:41:26.150,00:41:30.780
and log N + 1.,00:41:30.780,00:41:34.260
Yeah question.,00:41:34.260,00:41:35.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE],00:41:35.160,00:41:36.326
"PROFESSOR: This step
here is the step",00:41:46.039,00:41:47.580
that you're concerned about.,00:41:47.580,00:41:49.550
"So this step is a
geometric argument which",00:41:49.550,00:41:54.160
is analogous to this step.,00:41:54.160,00:41:57.070
"All right it's the
same type of argument.",00:41:57.070,00:42:01.320
"And in this case it's that
the rectangles are on top",00:42:01.320,00:42:04.720
"and so the area represented
on the right hand side",00:42:04.720,00:42:07.270
"is less than the area
represented on this side.",00:42:07.270,00:42:09.840
"And this is the
same type of thing",00:42:09.840,00:42:11.560
"except that the
rectangles are underneath.",00:42:11.560,00:42:14.400
"So the sum of the
areas of the rectangles",00:42:14.400,00:42:17.310
"is less than the
area under the curve.",00:42:17.310,00:42:19.190
All right.,00:42:23.741,00:42:24.240
"So I've now trapped
this quantity.",00:42:24.240,00:42:27.380
"And I'm now going to state
the sort of general results.",00:42:27.380,00:42:34.440
"So here's what's known
as integral comparison.",00:42:38.420,00:42:42.230
"It's this double
arrow correspondence",00:42:42.230,00:42:44.900
"in the general case,
for a very general case.",00:42:44.900,00:42:54.580
"There are actually even
more cases where it works.",00:42:54.580,00:42:57.130
"But this is a good
case and convenient.",00:42:57.130,00:43:01.220
"Now this is called
integral comparison.",00:43:01.220,00:43:02.845
"And it comes with hypotheses
but it follows the same argument",00:43:07.060,00:43:12.030
that I just gave.,00:43:12.030,00:43:13.495
"If f(x) is decreasing
and it's positive,",00:43:13.495,00:43:27.540
"then the sum f(n), n
equals 1 to infinity,",00:43:27.540,00:43:37.520
"minus the integral from
1 to infinity of f(x) dx",00:43:37.520,00:43:44.570
is less than f(1).,00:43:44.570,00:43:45.420
That's basically what we showed.,00:43:50.060,00:43:51.590
"We showed that the difference
between S_N and log N",00:43:51.590,00:43:54.570
was at most 1.,00:43:54.570,00:43:55.930
All right.,00:43:59.321,00:43:59.820
"Now if both of them
are-- And the sum",00:43:59.820,00:44:11.590
"and the integral converge
or diverge together.",00:44:11.590,00:44:25.380
"That is they either both
converge or both diverge.",00:44:25.380,00:44:27.750
"This is the type of test that
we like because then we can just",00:44:27.750,00:44:30.780
"convert the question of
convergence over here",00:44:30.780,00:44:33.000
"to this question of convergence
over on the other side.",00:44:33.000,00:44:37.770
"Now I remind you that
it's incredibly hard",00:44:37.770,00:44:41.590
to calculate these numbers.,00:44:41.590,00:44:44.870
"Whereas these numbers
are easier to calculate.",00:44:44.870,00:44:47.220
"Our goal is to reduce
things to simpler things.",00:44:47.220,00:44:50.390
"And in this case
sums, infinite sums",00:44:50.390,00:44:52.910
"are much harder than
infinite integrals.",00:44:52.910,00:44:54.720
"All right so that's the
integral comparison.",00:45:00.080,00:45:03.150
"And now I have one
last bit on comparisons",00:45:03.150,00:45:12.140
that I need to tell you about.,00:45:12.140,00:45:13.840
"And this is very much like
what we did with integrals.",00:45:13.840,00:45:16.310
"Which is a so called
limit comparison.",00:45:16.310,00:45:18.240
"The limit comparison
says the following:",00:45:29.200,00:45:31.190
"if f(n) is similar to g(n) --
recall that means f(n) / g(n)",00:45:31.190,00:45:45.210
"tends to 1 as n
goes to infinity --",00:45:45.210,00:45:51.760
and we're in the positive case.,00:45:51.760,00:45:55.000
"So let's just say
g(n) is positive.",00:45:55.000,00:45:57.535
"Then-- that doesn't
even, well-- then",00:46:03.920,00:46:05.490
"sum f(n), sum g(n)
either both-- same thing",00:46:05.490,00:46:15.055
"as above, either both
converge or both diverge.",00:46:15.055,00:46:21.884
All right.,00:46:27.488,00:46:28.770
"This is just saying
that if they behave",00:46:28.770,00:46:30.730
"the same way in the tail, which
is all we really care about,",00:46:30.730,00:46:33.920
"then they have similar behavior,
similar convergence properties.",00:46:33.920,00:46:40.820
"And let me give you
a couple examples.",00:46:44.107,00:46:45.690
"So here's one example: if you
take the sum 1 over n^2 + 1,",00:46:50.370,00:46:56.580
square root.,00:46:56.580,00:46:57.080
"This is going to be replaced
by something simpler.",00:47:01.890,00:47:05.350
Which is the main term here.,00:47:05.350,00:47:07.240
"Which is 1 over
square root of n^2,",00:47:07.240,00:47:10.460
"which we recognize as
sum 1/n, which diverges.",00:47:10.460,00:47:15.100
"So this guy is one
of the red guys.",00:47:17.920,00:47:20.440
On the red team.,00:47:24.300,00:47:26.410
Now we have another example.,00:47:26.410,00:47:30.330
"Which is let's say the square
root of n, I don't know,",00:47:33.370,00:47:38.960
to the fifth minus n^2.,00:47:38.960,00:47:43.080
"Now if you have
something where it's",00:47:43.080,00:47:44.665
"negative in the
denominator you kind of",00:47:44.665,00:47:46.290
"do have to watch out that
denominator makes sense.",00:47:46.290,00:47:49.540
It isn't 0.,00:47:49.540,00:47:50.570
"So we're going to be careful
and start this at n = 2.",00:47:50.570,00:47:53.042
"In which case, the first
term, I don't like 1/0",00:47:53.042,00:48:00.370
as a term in my series.,00:48:00.370,00:48:01.720
"So I'm just going to be a
little careful about how--",00:48:01.720,00:48:04.130
"as I said I was
kind of lazy here.",00:48:04.130,00:48:05.710
"I could have started this
one at 0 for instance.",00:48:05.710,00:48:09.930
All right.,00:48:09.930,00:48:10.810
So here's the picture.,00:48:10.810,00:48:14.110
"Now this I just replace by its
main term which is 1 over n^5,",00:48:14.110,00:48:19.070
square root.,00:48:19.070,00:48:20.340
"Which is sum 1/n^(5/2),
which converges.",00:48:20.340,00:48:25.975
All right.,00:48:28.705,00:48:29.520
The power is bigger than 1.,00:48:29.520,00:48:30.800
"1 is the divider for these
things and it just misses.",00:48:30.800,00:48:33.960
This one converges.,00:48:33.960,00:48:38.752
"All right so these
are the typical ways",00:48:38.752,00:48:41.800
"in which these convergence
processes are used.",00:48:41.800,00:48:47.355
All right.,00:48:47.355,00:48:47.870
"So I have one more
thing for you.",00:48:47.870,00:48:49.930
"Which is an advertisement
for next time.",00:48:49.930,00:48:52.600
"And I have this demo
here which I will grab.",00:48:52.600,00:48:56.360
But you will see this next time.,00:48:56.360,00:48:58.300
"So here's a question for
you to think about overnight",00:48:58.300,00:49:00.880
"but don't ask friends, you have
to think about it yourself.",00:49:00.880,00:49:04.240
So here's the problem.,00:49:04.240,00:49:05.492
"Here are some blocks
which I acquired",00:49:05.492,00:49:08.000
when my kids left home.,00:49:08.000,00:49:09.390
"Anyway yeah that'll happen to
you too in about four years.",00:49:12.190,00:49:20.550
"So now here you are,
these are blocks.",00:49:20.550,00:49:25.929
"So now here's the
question that we're",00:49:25.929,00:49:27.470
