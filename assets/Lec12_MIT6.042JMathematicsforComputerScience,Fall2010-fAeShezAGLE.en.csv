with a simple problem",00:00:22.741,00:00:24.740
"that many of you may
have already encountered.",00:00:24.740,00:00:27.670
"For example, when you
got a student loan",00:00:27.670,00:00:29.840
"or if your family took a
loan out on your house,",00:00:29.840,00:00:32.564
"you know, a home mortgage
loan, and it's the problem",00:00:32.564,00:00:35.310
of pricing an annuity.,00:00:35.310,00:00:37.420
"An annuity is a
financial instrument",00:00:37.420,00:00:39.720
"that pays a fixed
amount of money",00:00:39.720,00:00:42.660
"every year for some
number of years,",00:00:42.660,00:00:44.910
"and it has a value
associated with it.",00:00:44.910,00:00:47.015
"For example, with
a student loan,",00:00:47.015,00:00:48.390
"the value is the amount of
money they gave you to pay MIT,",00:00:48.390,00:00:52.540
"then later in life-- every
year or every month-- you're",00:00:52.540,00:00:56.180
going to send them a check.,00:00:56.180,00:00:57.860
"And you want to sort of equate
those two things to find out,",00:00:57.860,00:01:00.821
"are you getting enough
money for the money",00:01:00.821,00:01:02.570
"you're going to pay back
monthly sometime in the future?",00:01:02.570,00:01:05.489
"So let's define this, and
there's a lot of variations",00:01:05.489,00:01:09.990
"on annuities, but we'll
start with one that's called",00:01:09.990,00:01:14.430
"an n-year $m-dollar
payment annuity,",00:01:14.430,00:01:30.450
"and it works by paying m dollars
at the start of each year,",00:01:30.450,00:01:46.950
and it lasts for n years.,00:01:46.950,00:01:48.582
"Now, usually n is
finite, but not always,",00:01:52.770,00:01:55.244
"and in a few minutes
we'll talk about the case",00:01:55.244,00:01:57.160
when it's infinite.,00:01:57.160,00:01:59.150
"But this includes
home mortgages,",00:01:59.150,00:02:01.850

month for 30 years.",00:02:01.850,00:02:03.690

you the million dollars.",00:02:05.800,00:02:07.890

"You pay in every
year, and then you",00:02:14.880,00:02:17.270
get some big lump sum later.,00:02:17.270,00:02:19.620
"Life insurance benefits,
you know, and so forth.",00:02:19.620,00:02:22.880

Street, this is a big deal.",00:02:22.880,00:02:25.940
"A lot of the stuff that
happens on Wall Street",00:02:25.940,00:02:28.080
"involves annuities in
one form or another,",00:02:28.080,00:02:30.580
"packaging them all up
and, in fact, we'll",00:02:30.580,00:02:34.230
"look at later when
we do probability.",00:02:34.230,00:02:36.120
"It was how these things
were packaged and sold",00:02:36.120,00:02:38.380
"that led to the sub-prime
mortgage disaster,",00:02:38.380,00:02:41.270
"and we'll see how some confusion
over independents, when",00:02:41.270,00:02:44.270
"you look at random variables,
led to the global recession,",00:02:44.270,00:02:47.680
a real disaster.,00:02:47.680,00:02:48.971
"Of course, some people
understood how all that worked,",00:02:48.971,00:02:51.220
"made hundreds of billions
of dollars at the same time.",00:02:51.220,00:02:53.820
"So it was sort of money went
from one place to another.",00:02:53.820,00:02:57.260
"So it's pretty
important to understand",00:02:57.260,00:02:59.790
how much this is worth.,00:02:59.790,00:03:02.930

it will pay you",00:03:05.120,00:03:06.620
"m dollars at the beginning of
each year for n years, what",00:03:06.620,00:03:09.160
is that worth today?,00:03:09.160,00:03:11.430
"For example, say I
gave you a choice--",00:03:11.430,00:03:14.650
"the Megabucks choice--
$50,000 a year",00:03:14.650,00:03:17.580
"for 20 years or a
million dollars today.",00:03:17.580,00:03:21.950
"How many people would prefer
the $50,000 a year for 20 years?",00:03:21.950,00:03:26.430
A few of you.,00:03:26.430,00:03:27.030
"How many would prefer the
million bucks right up front?",00:03:27.030,00:03:30.840
Much better.,00:03:30.840,00:03:31.670
OK.,00:03:31.670,00:03:32.630
"Always better to have
the cash in hand,",00:03:32.630,00:03:34.970
"because there's things
like inflation--",00:03:34.970,00:03:36.900
pretty low now-- interest.,00:03:36.900,00:03:39.680
"You can put the
money in the bank",00:03:39.680,00:03:41.160
"or invest it and make
some money hopefully.",00:03:41.160,00:03:44.980
"So the million dollars
today is a lot better,",00:03:44.980,00:03:47.170
"which is why the State pays you
50 grand a year for 20 years.",00:03:47.170,00:03:50.960
"It's better for them, and
they call it a million bucks.",00:03:50.960,00:03:53.614
"So that was pretty
clear, but what",00:03:53.614,00:03:55.030
"if I gave you this option-- 700
grand today or 50 grand a year",00:03:55.030,00:04:01.950
for 20 years?,00:04:01.950,00:04:03.700
"How many people want the cash
upfront-- 700 grand only.",00:04:03.700,00:04:08.090
A few.,00:04:08.090,00:04:08.660
"How many people want 50
grand a year for 20 years?",00:04:08.660,00:04:13.310
"All right, we're almost--
that's pretty close to half way.",00:04:13.310,00:04:15.770
"How about 500 grand today versus
50 grand a year for 20 years?",00:04:15.770,00:04:20.750
"How many want half
a million today?",00:04:20.750,00:04:24.511
A lot of people like the cash.,00:04:24.511,00:04:25.760
"You know, it's this kind of a
time, you have the recession,",00:04:25.760,00:04:28.218
it's a disaster on Wall Street.,00:04:28.218,00:04:29.617
"You know, Street Wall
Street didn't like the cash.",00:04:29.617,00:04:31.700
"How many want, instead
of a half a million",00:04:31.700,00:04:34.100
"up front, 50 grand
a year for 20 years?",00:04:34.100,00:04:37.252
"All right, now
we're about halfway.",00:04:37.252,00:04:38.710
"All right, well
that's pretty good.",00:04:38.710,00:04:39.850
"So we're going to find
out what you should pay,",00:04:39.850,00:04:41.815
"or at least one way
of estimating that.",00:04:41.815,00:04:44.750
"Now, to do that, we've
got to figure out what",00:04:44.750,00:04:48.460
$1 today is worth in a year.,00:04:48.460,00:04:53.670
"And to do that, we
make an assumption,",00:04:53.670,00:05:00.364
"and the assumption
is that there's",00:05:00.364,00:05:01.780
"a fixed-- we'll call
it an interest rate.",00:05:01.780,00:05:06.600
"It's sort of the devaluation
of the money per year.",00:05:06.600,00:05:09.610
And we're going to call it p.,00:05:12.180,00:05:13.490
"Later we'll plug
in values for p,",00:05:13.490,00:05:15.000
"but you can think of
it as like 6%, 1%.",00:05:15.000,00:05:18.672
"You know, it's the money,
if you put money in a bank,",00:05:18.672,00:05:20.880
"they'll give you some
percent back every year.",00:05:20.880,00:05:23.650
"And, of course, the fact
that different people",00:05:23.650,00:05:25.639
"have different ideas
of what this would be,",00:05:25.639,00:05:27.430
"allows people to make
money on Wall Street.",00:05:27.430,00:05:29.950
"As we'll see, a
slight difference in p",00:05:29.950,00:05:32.440
"can make big differences in
what the annuity is worth.",00:05:32.440,00:05:36.460
"So for example, $1 today
is going to equal 1 plus p",00:05:36.460,00:05:48.380
dollars in one year.,00:05:48.380,00:05:50.662
"Similarly, $1 today--
how much is that",00:05:54.360,00:05:57.290
going to be worth in two years?,00:05:57.290,00:05:59.645
"Say that p stays fixed,
the same over all time.",00:06:03.910,00:06:06.528
"One plus p squared,
because every year you",00:06:10.060,00:06:14.360
"multiply what you got by
1 plus p, because that's",00:06:14.360,00:06:16.970
the interest you're getting.,00:06:16.970,00:06:18.560
"All right, we'll think of
it in terms of interest.",00:06:18.560,00:06:20.940
"In three years, $1 today
is worth 1 plus p cubed in",00:06:20.940,00:06:28.070
three years and so forth.,00:06:28.070,00:06:32.660
All right.,00:06:32.660,00:06:33.160
"Now, what we really care about
is what's $1, or m dollars,",00:06:33.160,00:06:36.750
"worth today if you're
getting it next year?",00:06:36.750,00:06:40.090
"So we need to sort of flip
this back the other way.",00:06:40.090,00:06:44.026
"So what is $1 in a year
worth today in terms of p?",00:06:47.930,00:06:56.510
"So if I'm going to
be paid $1 in a year,",00:06:59.160,00:07:01.722
"what would be the equivalent
amount to be paid today?",00:07:01.722,00:07:03.930
"One over 1 plus p, because
what's happening here",00:07:07.580,00:07:13.480
"is, as you go forward in a year,
you just multiply by 1 plus p.",00:07:13.480,00:07:17.690
"So 1 over 1 plus p turns
into $1 in a year-- being",00:07:17.690,00:07:24.510
paid in a year.,00:07:24.510,00:07:27.270
All right.,00:07:27.270,00:07:28.130
"What is $1 a year in
two years worth today?",00:07:28.130,00:07:35.027
One over 1 plus p squared.,00:07:37.650,00:07:42.610
"So $1 in two years is
worth this much today.",00:07:42.610,00:07:48.060
"Well, now we can use
this to go figure",00:07:48.060,00:07:50.800
"out the current value
of that annuity.",00:07:50.800,00:07:55.080
"We just figure out what every
payment is worth today and then",00:07:55.080,00:07:59.060
add it up.,00:07:59.060,00:08:01.380
"So we'll put the
payments over here,",00:08:01.380,00:08:04.220
"and we'll compute
the current value",00:08:04.220,00:08:06.890
of every payment on this side.,00:08:06.890,00:08:08.500
"So with the annuity,
the way we've",00:08:11.840,00:08:13.580
"set it up is it pays n dollars
at the start of every year,",00:08:13.580,00:08:16.630
so the first payment is now.,00:08:16.630,00:08:19.970
"So the first of the
n payments is now,",00:08:19.970,00:08:23.710
"and since it's being paid
now, that's worth m dollars.",00:08:23.710,00:08:27.130
There's no devaluation.,00:08:27.130,00:08:30.320
"The next payment is m
dollars in one year,",00:08:30.320,00:08:36.789
"and so that's going to be
worth m over 1 plus p today.",00:08:36.789,00:08:43.360
"And the next payment is
m dollars in two years.",00:08:43.360,00:08:48.850
"That's worth m over
1 plus p squared,",00:08:48.850,00:08:53.870
"and we keep on going
until the last payment.",00:08:53.870,00:08:57.880
"It's the n-th payment, so it's
m dollars in n minus 1 years.",00:08:57.880,00:09:03.647
"And so that's going to
be worth m over 1 plus p",00:09:06.330,00:09:13.260
to the n minus 1.,00:09:13.260,00:09:14.437
All right.,00:09:16.891,00:09:17.390
"So we can compute the current
value of all those payments,",00:09:17.390,00:09:20.440
"then the annuity is computed--
the value is computed just",00:09:20.440,00:09:24.430
"by adding these up, of
all the current values.",00:09:24.430,00:09:28.820
"So the total current value is
the sum i equals 0 to n minus 1",00:09:28.820,00:09:39.012
of m over 1 plus p to the i.,00:09:39.012,00:09:44.490
"And that is the
total current value.",00:09:44.490,00:09:46.273
"That's what you should
pay today for the annuity.",00:09:50.300,00:09:56.830
Any questions?,00:09:56.830,00:09:59.590
What we did here?,00:09:59.590,00:10:02.150
All right.,00:10:02.150,00:10:03.890
"Well, of course, what we'd like
is a closed form expression",00:10:03.890,00:10:07.370
here.,00:10:07.370,00:10:08.427
"Something that's simple
so we could actually",00:10:08.427,00:10:10.260
"get a feel without having
to add up all those terms,",00:10:10.260,00:10:14.980
and that's not hard to get.,00:10:14.980,00:10:16.520
"In fact, let's put
this sum in a form",00:10:16.520,00:10:20.560
that might be more familiar.,00:10:20.560,00:10:23.420
"This equals-- we'll pull
the m out in front--",00:10:23.420,00:10:27.310
"and let's use x to be 1
over 1 plus p to the i.",00:10:27.310,00:10:30.370
"And so x equals 1 over 1 plus
p, and I wrote it this way",00:10:37.140,00:10:47.330
because this might be familiar.,00:10:47.330,00:10:51.249
"Does everybody remember
that from-- I think",00:10:51.249,00:10:53.040
it was the second recitation?,00:10:53.040,00:10:55.112
Anybody remember the formula?,00:10:57.862,00:10:59.070
What this evaluates to?,00:10:59.070,00:11:00.180
"The sum of x to the i, where
i goes from 0 to n minus 1?",00:11:02.980,00:11:09.380
Remember that?,00:11:09.380,00:11:11.170
One minus x to the n.,00:11:11.170,00:11:12.970
Remember 1 minus x.,00:11:15.730,00:11:18.820
"In the second
recitation, I think,",00:11:18.820,00:11:20.550
we proved that this equals that.,00:11:20.550,00:11:23.550
"What was the proof
technique we used?",00:11:23.550,00:11:26.370
Induction.,00:11:26.370,00:11:27.391
OK?,00:11:27.391,00:11:27.890
"So, in fact, there's
a theorem here.",00:11:33.490,00:11:37.476
"For all n bigger and equal
to 1 and x not equal to 1,",00:11:41.060,00:11:46.730
"we proved the sum from i equals
0 to n minus 1 x to the i",00:11:46.730,00:11:52.360
"equals 1 minus x to
the n over 1 minus x.",00:11:52.360,00:11:57.270
"And so this is a
nice, closed form.",00:11:57.270,00:11:58.870
"No sum any more, just
that, which is nice.",00:11:58.870,00:12:04.040
"Now, induction proved
it was the right answer.",00:12:04.040,00:12:07.960
"Once you knew it-- we gave
it to you-- using induction",00:12:07.960,00:12:13.450
"to prove that
theorem wasn't hard.",00:12:13.450,00:12:16.100
"What we're going to look at
doing this week and next week",00:12:16.100,00:12:19.310
"is figuring out how
to figure out this",00:12:19.310,00:12:21.580
"was the answer in
the first place.",00:12:21.580,00:12:23.550
"Methods for doing that-- to
evaluate the sum-- and there's",00:12:23.550,00:12:28.240
"a lot of ways that you can
do that particular sum.",00:12:28.240,00:12:32.050
"Probably the easiest is known
as the perturbation method.",00:12:32.050,00:12:36.480
This sometimes works.,00:12:40.050,00:12:42.090
"Certainly with sums like
that, it often works.",00:12:42.090,00:12:45.200
The idea is as follows.,00:12:45.200,00:12:46.460
"We're trying to compute
the sum S, which is 1",00:12:46.460,00:12:49.460
"plus x plus x squared
plus x to the n minus 1,",00:12:49.460,00:12:57.500
"and what we're going to do
is perturb it a little bit",00:12:57.500,00:13:01.230
"and then subtract to
get big cancellation.",00:13:01.230,00:13:05.210
"In this case, it's
pretty simple.",00:13:05.210,00:13:06.620
"We multiply the sum by x to get
x plus x squared plus-- I've",00:13:06.620,00:13:19.130
"defined S to be that,
x times S-- well, I",00:13:19.130,00:13:22.380
"get x plus x squared and
so forth, up to x to the n,",00:13:22.380,00:13:28.450
"and now I can subtract one from
the other and almost everything",00:13:28.450,00:13:32.673
cancels.,00:13:32.673,00:13:33.173
"So I get 1 minus x
times S equals 1.",00:13:36.020,00:13:42.220
"These cancel, cancel, cancel.",00:13:42.220,00:13:45.450
Minus x to the n.,00:13:45.450,00:13:48.750
"And therefore S equals 1 minus
x to the n over 1 minus x.",00:13:48.750,00:13:54.310
So that's a vague method.,00:13:57.000,00:14:01.820
"This gets used all the time
in applied mathematics,",00:14:01.820,00:14:04.930
"and they call it the
perturbation method.",00:14:04.930,00:14:06.930
"Take your sum, wiggle
it around a little bit,",00:14:06.930,00:14:10.150
"get something that looks
close, subtract it,",00:14:10.150,00:14:11.990
"everything cancels,
life is nice,",00:14:11.990,00:14:14.201
"and all of a sudden you've
figured out the answer.",00:14:14.201,00:14:16.284
"So getting back to
our annuity problem,",00:14:21.530,00:14:26.930
"we can plug that
formula back in here.",00:14:26.930,00:14:31.660
"So the value of the annuity
is m times 1 minus x to the n",00:14:31.660,00:14:39.030
over 1 minus x.,00:14:39.030,00:14:41.080
"We'll plug in x equals
1 over 1 plus p,",00:14:41.080,00:14:47.570
"and we get m 1 minus
1 over 1 plus p",00:14:47.570,00:14:54.670
"to the n over 1 minus 1 over
1 plus p, just plugging in.",00:14:54.670,00:15:01.830
"And now to simplify this, I'll
multiply the top and bottom",00:15:01.830,00:15:05.150
"by 1 plus p, and I'll get 1
plus p minus 1 on the bottom.",00:15:05.150,00:15:11.920
Just gives me a p on the bottom.,00:15:11.920,00:15:14.080
"I have a 1 plus p on
the top minus 1 over 1",00:15:14.080,00:15:19.040
"plus p to the n
minus 1, all over p.",00:15:19.040,00:15:23.680
"So now we have a formula--
closed form expression",00:15:27.740,00:15:30.850
"formula-- for the
value of the annuity.",00:15:30.850,00:15:33.840
"All's we've got to plug in
is m, the payment every year,",00:15:33.840,00:15:37.400
"n, the number of years, and
then p, the interest rate.",00:15:37.400,00:15:41.560
"And so, for example, if
we made m be $50,000,",00:15:41.560,00:15:51.540
as in the lottery.,00:15:51.540,00:15:52.390
"We made n be 20 years, and
say we took 6% interest, which",00:15:52.390,00:15:58.640
"is actually very good these
days, and I plug those in here,",00:15:58.640,00:16:03.710
"the value is going
to be $607,906.",00:16:03.710,00:16:12.710
All right.,00:16:12.710,00:16:13.210
"So those of you that preferred
700 grand-- if you assume 6%",00:16:13.210,00:16:17.680
interest-- you're right.,00:16:17.680,00:16:19.560
"Those of you who
preferred 500 grand, no,",00:16:19.560,00:16:21.920
"you're better off waiting and
getting your 50 grand a year.",00:16:21.920,00:16:25.360
"Now, of course, if the
interest rate is lower,",00:16:25.360,00:16:28.500
"well, that changes things.",00:16:28.500,00:16:31.020
That shifts it even more.,00:16:31.020,00:16:32.800
"The annuity is worth even more
if the interest rate is lower--",00:16:32.800,00:16:36.360
if p is smaller.,00:16:36.360,00:16:38.540
"In fact, say p was 0.",00:16:38.540,00:16:42.400
"Say the interest rate is 0, so
$1 today equals $1 tomorrow,",00:16:42.400,00:16:45.310
then what is the lottery worth?,00:16:45.310,00:16:48.350
A million dollars.,00:16:48.350,00:16:50.130
"And the bigger p gets, the
less your payment is worth.",00:16:50.130,00:16:53.230
Any questions about that?,00:16:57.660,00:16:58.915
OK.,00:17:01.530,00:17:03.320
"What if you were paid $50,000 a
year forever-- you live forever",00:17:03.320,00:17:11.170
"or it goes to your
estate and your heirs,",00:17:11.170,00:17:13.950
"$50,000 a year forever or
a million dollars today.",00:17:13.950,00:17:18.960
"How many people want the
million dollars today?",00:17:21.609,00:17:25.200
"How many want 50
grand a year forever?",00:17:25.200,00:17:29.530
Sounds good.,00:17:29.530,00:17:30.730
"You know, that's an infinite
amount of money, sort of.",00:17:30.730,00:17:34.560
It's not as good as it sounds.,00:17:34.560,00:17:36.190
Let's see why.,00:17:36.190,00:17:39.290
"So this is a case where
n equals infinity,",00:17:39.290,00:17:45.150
"and so I'll claim that
if n equals infinity,",00:17:45.150,00:17:50.840
"then the value of this
annuity is just m times 1",00:17:50.840,00:17:56.100
plus p over p.,00:17:56.100,00:17:57.180
Let's see why that's the case.,00:18:00.100,00:18:02.789
"You know, it sounds
hard to evaluate,",00:18:02.789,00:18:04.330
"because it's an infinite
number of payments,",00:18:04.330,00:18:07.930
"but what happens here
when n goes to infinity?",00:18:07.930,00:18:12.250
What happens to this thing?,00:18:12.250,00:18:15.300
"That goes to 0 as
n goes to infinity,",00:18:15.300,00:18:18.530
as long as p is bigger than 0.,00:18:18.530,00:18:20.000
"So we're going to
assume 6% interest.",00:18:20.000,00:18:22.800
"So that goes away, so
the annuity is worth just",00:18:22.800,00:18:25.340
"that, m times 1 plus p over
p, because the limit as n",00:18:25.340,00:18:31.000
"goes to infinity of 1 over
1 plus p to the n minus 1,",00:18:31.000,00:18:36.550
that's going to 0.,00:18:36.550,00:18:39.890
"So the value for m is $50,000,
and at 6% V is only $883,000.",00:18:39.890,00:19:02.390
"So you're better off
taking a million dollars",00:19:02.390,00:19:04.450
"today than $50,000
a year forever.",00:19:04.450,00:19:08.704
"Now, if you think about
it, and think about it",00:19:08.704,00:19:10.620
"as an interest
rate, why should it",00:19:10.620,00:19:12.350
"be obvious that you're better
off with a million dollars",00:19:12.350,00:19:14.950
"today than 50 grand
a year forever?",00:19:14.950,00:19:19.179
"Think about what you could
do with that million dollars",00:19:19.179,00:19:21.470
"if you had it today
at 6% interest.",00:19:21.470,00:19:27.790
"What would you do with it to
make more money than 50 grand",00:19:27.790,00:19:31.710
a year forever?,00:19:31.710,00:19:32.360
Yeah.,00:19:32.360,00:19:33.478
"AUDIENCE: You could have like--
you could make $50,000 per year",00:19:33.478,00:19:36.102
just off of [INAUDIBLE].,00:19:36.102,00:19:37.754
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:19:37.754,00:19:38.420
"In this model, if the
interest rate is 6%,",00:19:38.420,00:19:40.820
you can put in the bank.,00:19:40.820,00:19:41.820
"It makes 6% every year, that's
60 grand a year forever.",00:19:41.820,00:19:45.300
"Better than 50 grand
a year forever.",00:19:45.300,00:19:48.150
"So maybe it's-- even
without doing the math,",00:19:48.150,00:19:50.294
"you can tell which
way it's going to go,",00:19:50.294,00:19:51.960
"but this tells you
exactly what it's worth.",00:19:51.960,00:19:54.396

you have $1 in the future--",00:20:09.220,00:20:14.010

"AUDIENCE: --where S right
now is m over 1 plus p--",00:20:15.086,00:20:17.869

"AUDIENCE: --is it worth less to
you [INAUDIBLE] then later on,",00:20:18.535,00:20:21.118

worth more to you.",00:20:21.118,00:20:23.000
"PROFESSOR: Ah, so
if you move yourself",00:20:23.000,00:20:24.930
"forward in time, $1 a year, in
a year it'll worth $1 to you--",00:20:24.930,00:20:28.584
AUDIENCE: Yeah.,00:20:28.584,00:20:29.360
"PROFESSOR: --but today it's
worth less than $1 to you,",00:20:29.360,00:20:32.490
"because you could take the
dollar today and invest",00:20:32.490,00:20:35.070
"in the bank, and it's worth more
in a year, because the money",00:20:35.070,00:20:38.180
"grows in value, as a
way to think of it,",00:20:38.180,00:20:41.700
"because you can
earn interest on it.",00:20:41.700,00:20:43.510
What's that?,00:20:43.510,00:20:44.104
AUDIENCE: You could spend it.,00:20:44.104,00:20:45.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:20:45.760,00:20:46.480
"Yeah, if you just
spend it, well,",00:20:46.480,00:20:48.030
"then at least you
had the use of what",00:20:48.030,00:20:49.571
you spent it on for the year.,00:20:49.571,00:20:51.009
"So there's some other
kind of value, right?",00:20:51.009,00:20:52.800
"Maybe you bought a
house or something",00:20:52.800,00:20:55.660
"that-- maybe something that
even appreciated in value.",00:20:55.660,00:20:59.410
OK.,00:20:59.410,00:21:00.610
"But these things
get sort of squishy,",00:21:00.610,00:21:04.396
"and that is where
a lot of people",00:21:04.396,00:21:05.770
"make money on Wall Street, is
because different companies",00:21:05.770,00:21:08.890
have different needs for money.,00:21:08.890,00:21:10.330
"They have different views of
what the interest rates are",00:21:10.330,00:21:11.860
"going to be, and you
can play in the middle",00:21:11.860,00:21:14.180
"and make a lot of
money that way.",00:21:14.180,00:21:16.170
"So more generally, there's
a corollary to the theorem,",00:21:35.220,00:21:39.620
"and that is that if the absolute
value of x is less than 1,",00:21:39.620,00:21:44.030
"then the sum i equals 0
to infinity x to the i",00:21:44.030,00:21:51.650
is just 1 over 1 minus x.,00:21:51.650,00:21:56.080
"We didn't prove this back
in the second recitation,",00:21:56.080,00:21:59.350
"because there's no
n to induct on here,",00:21:59.350,00:22:02.130
"but the proof is simple
from the theorem.",00:22:02.130,00:22:05.220
"And it's simply because
if x is less than 1,",00:22:05.220,00:22:08.060
"an absolute value, as n goes
to infinity, that goes to 0,",00:22:08.060,00:22:13.330
"and so you're just left
with 1 over 1 minus x.",00:22:13.330,00:22:15.410
"So, for example,
what's this sum?",00:22:26.650,00:22:31.680
"This one you all know, I'm sure.",00:22:31.680,00:22:33.075
Out to infinity.,00:22:37.010,00:22:37.880
What's that sum to?,00:22:37.880,00:22:40.970
To 2.,00:22:40.970,00:22:41.600
Yeah.,00:22:41.600,00:22:42.250
"It's 1 over 1 minus
1/2, which is 2.",00:22:42.250,00:22:47.710
"What about this sum
out to infinity?",00:22:47.710,00:22:55.370
What does that sum to?,00:22:55.370,00:22:56.505
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:22:59.263,00:23:01.430
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, 3/2, 1
over 1 minus 1/3 is 3/2.",00:23:01.430,00:23:07.700

of geometric series.",00:23:09.920,00:23:12.460

of a geometric series is.",00:23:12.460,00:23:14.600
"Something that's going
down by a fixed-- each term",00:23:14.600,00:23:16.810
"goes down by the same
fixed amount every time.",00:23:16.810,00:23:19.490

series, generally sum",00:23:19.490,00:23:22.580
"to something that is very
close to the largest term.",00:23:22.580,00:23:26.140
"In this case, it's 1.",00:23:26.140,00:23:28.590
"Very common, because
of that formula.",00:23:28.590,00:23:31.380
It's 1 over 1 minus x.,00:23:31.380,00:23:32.772
"Any questions about this
or geometric series?",00:23:40.270,00:23:43.720
All right.,00:23:46.760,00:23:48.280
"Well, those are
straight geometric sums.",00:23:48.280,00:23:51.140
"Sometimes you run into things
that are a little bit more",00:23:51.140,00:23:53.500
complicated.,00:23:53.500,00:23:54.930
"For example, say I have this
kind of a sum, i equals 1 to n,",00:23:54.930,00:24:01.570
i times x to the i.,00:24:01.570,00:24:05.030
"Now, those are adding up x
plus 2x squared plus 3x cubed,",00:24:05.030,00:24:11.100
"and so forth, up
to n x to the n.",00:24:11.100,00:24:16.369
"You know, that's a
little more complicated.",00:24:16.369,00:24:18.160
"The terms are
getting-- decreasing",00:24:18.160,00:24:21.480
"by a factor of x, increasing by
1 in terms of the coefficient",00:24:21.480,00:24:24.680
every time.,00:24:24.680,00:24:25.420
A little trickier.,00:24:25.420,00:24:27.200
"So say we wanted to get a
closed form expression for that?",00:24:27.200,00:24:31.280
"There are several
ways we can do it.",00:24:31.280,00:24:33.130

perturbation-- the perturbation",00:24:33.130,00:24:37.190
method.,00:24:37.190,00:24:37.900
Let's try that.,00:24:37.900,00:24:40.730

squared plus 3x cubed plus nx",00:24:40.730,00:24:48.370

the same perturbation.",00:24:48.370,00:24:51.920
"Multiply by x, I
get that x squared",00:24:51.920,00:24:57.610
"plus 2x cubed plus n minus 1x to
the n, plus nx to the n plus 1.",00:24:57.610,00:25:09.420
"And then I subtract to try
to get all the cancellation.",00:25:09.420,00:25:12.370
So then I do that.,00:25:15.220,00:25:17.410
"I get 1 minus x times S. Well, I
didn't quite cancel everything.",00:25:17.410,00:25:24.540
"X plus x squared
plus x cubed plus x",00:25:24.540,00:25:31.960
"to the n plus n-- or
minus nx to the n plus 1.",00:25:31.960,00:25:37.960
"Ah, it didn't quite work.",00:25:37.960,00:25:41.010
"Anybody see a way that
I can fix this up?",00:25:41.010,00:25:43.708
What about this piece?,00:25:49.480,00:25:51.610
That's still a mess here.,00:25:51.610,00:25:53.020
Can I simplify that?,00:25:53.020,00:25:56.240
Yeah?,00:25:56.240,00:25:57.522
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:25:57.522,00:25:58.474
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:26:05.150,00:26:06.761
There's,00:26:06.761,00:26:07.260
a simpler way.,00:26:07.260,00:26:08.990
Yeah.,00:26:08.990,00:26:09.721
"AUDIENCE: That's a
geometric series.",00:26:09.721,00:26:11.220
"PROFESSOR: That's
a geometric series.",00:26:11.220,00:26:13.160
"We just got the formula
for it, so that's easy.",00:26:13.160,00:26:16.360
"This equals 1 minus x to the
n over 1 minus x minus the 1,",00:26:16.360,00:26:25.140
because I'm missing the 1 here.,00:26:25.140,00:26:26.910
"So we can rewrite this
whole thing over here.",00:26:26.910,00:26:29.040
Oops.,00:26:39.551,00:26:40.050
Yikes.,00:26:40.050,00:26:40.550
Got attacked.,00:26:40.550,00:26:41.481
What's that?,00:26:49.880,00:26:50.560
"AUDIENCE: Would it be 1
minus x should be n plus 1?",00:26:50.560,00:26:53.960
PROFESSOR: Yes it would.,00:26:53.960,00:26:56.710
That's right.,00:26:56.710,00:26:57.360
I've got to add 1 to there.,00:26:57.360,00:26:59.630
OK.,00:26:59.630,00:27:00.200
So that's good.,00:27:00.200,00:27:02.630
"So that says that
1 minus x times S",00:27:02.630,00:27:08.040
"equals 1 minus x to the n
plus 1 over 1 minus x minus 1,",00:27:08.040,00:27:15.317
"and then I've got to remember
to subtract that term too.",00:27:15.317,00:27:17.650
Minus nx to the n plus 1.,00:27:17.650,00:27:21.630
"That means now I
just divide through,",00:27:21.630,00:27:24.700
"and I simplify-- divide through
by 1 minus x-- and simplify,",00:27:24.700,00:27:27.990
and I get the following formula.,00:27:27.990,00:27:30.070
"I won't go through all the
details, but it's not hard.",00:27:30.070,00:27:32.390
Let's see if I got that right.,00:27:45.460,00:27:48.590
"Yeah, that looks right.",00:27:48.590,00:27:50.450
"OK, so that is the
closed form expression",00:27:50.450,00:27:52.780
"for that sum, which we can
get from the perturbation",00:27:52.780,00:27:55.839
"method and the fact
that we'd already",00:27:55.839,00:27:57.380
done the geometric series.,00:27:57.380,00:28:00.940
"There's another way to
compute these kinds of sums,",00:28:00.940,00:28:05.700
"which I want to show you,
because it can be useful.",00:28:05.700,00:28:08.267
"So we're going to do the same
sum and derive the formula",00:28:16.170,00:28:19.180
a different way.,00:28:19.180,00:28:21.180
"This method is called
the derivative method,",00:28:21.180,00:28:31.720
"and the idea is to start
with a geometric series which",00:28:31.720,00:28:34.440
"it's close to and then
take a derivative.",00:28:34.440,00:28:39.280
"So for x not equal to 1, we
already know from the theorem",00:28:39.280,00:28:43.700
"that i equals 0 to n, x to the
i equals 1 minus x to the n",00:28:43.700,00:28:50.080
plus 1 over 1 minus x.,00:28:50.080,00:28:53.170
That was the theorem.,00:28:53.170,00:28:54.120
We already know that.,00:28:54.120,00:28:57.010
"Now, I can take the
derivative of both sides,",00:28:57.010,00:28:59.670
"and let's see what we get
by taking the derivative.",00:28:59.670,00:29:03.220
"Well, here I get the sum.",00:29:03.220,00:29:07.440
"The derivative of x to the
i is just i times x to the i",00:29:07.440,00:29:10.320
minus 1.,00:29:10.320,00:29:13.020
"The derivative over here
is a little messier.",00:29:13.020,00:29:16.310
"I've got to have--
well, I take 1 minus x",00:29:16.310,00:29:19.400
times a derivative of that.,00:29:19.400,00:29:20.570
"Derivative of this is now
minus n plus 1, x to the n.",00:29:23.530,00:29:33.020
"Then I take this times
the derivative of that",00:29:33.020,00:29:36.980
"is now minus minus 1, 1
minus x to the n plus 1,",00:29:36.980,00:29:44.790
"and then I divide
by that squared.",00:29:44.790,00:29:48.120
"Now, when we compute all that
out, we get this, 1 minus n",00:29:52.730,00:29:58.390
"plus 1, x to the n plus
nx to the n plus 1 over 1",00:29:58.390,00:30:06.690
minus x squared.,00:30:06.690,00:30:09.689
"I won't drag you
through the algebra,",00:30:09.689,00:30:11.230
"but it's not hard to
go from there to there.",00:30:11.230,00:30:13.480
"This is pretty close
to what we wanted.",00:30:13.480,00:30:17.020
"We're trying to figure out
this, and we almost got there.",00:30:17.020,00:30:25.540
What do I do to finish it up?,00:30:25.540,00:30:28.470
AUDIENCE: Multiply by x.,00:30:28.470,00:30:29.470
PROFESSOR: Multiply by x.,00:30:29.470,00:30:30.900
Good.,00:30:30.900,00:30:31.730
"So if I take this and multiply
by x, i equals zero to n,",00:30:31.730,00:30:40.140
"ix to the i equals x minus
n plus 1, x to the n plus 1,",00:30:40.140,00:30:49.060
"plus nx to the n plus 2,
all over 1 minus x squared.",00:30:49.060,00:30:56.240
OK?,00:30:56.240,00:30:57.887
"Which should be the same--
yeah-- the same formula",00:30:57.887,00:30:59.970
we had up there.,00:30:59.970,00:31:01.776
"So that's called the
derivative method.",00:31:01.776,00:31:03.400
"You can start manipulating--
you treat these things",00:31:03.400,00:31:05.525
"as polynomials-- these sums--
and you start manipulating them",00:31:05.525,00:31:09.230
like you would polynomials.,00:31:09.230,00:31:10.930
"In fact, there's a whole
branch of mathematics",00:31:10.930,00:31:13.670
"called generating functions
that we won't have time",00:31:13.670,00:31:15.830
"to do in this class that's
in chapter 12 of the text.",00:31:15.830,00:31:20.560
"But you do things
like that to get sums.",00:31:20.560,00:31:24.426
"Any questions about
what we did there?",00:31:29.820,00:31:33.430
"You can also do a version where
you take integrals of this",00:31:33.430,00:31:36.800
"if you want, and
then you get the i's",00:31:36.800,00:31:39.260
"in the denominator instead
of those coefficients.",00:31:39.260,00:31:41.708
"For homework, I
think we've given you",00:31:45.340,00:31:48.980
the sum of i squared x to the i.,00:31:48.980,00:31:52.761
"How do you think you're
going to do that?",00:31:52.761,00:31:56.640
"Any thoughts about how
you're going to solve that?",00:31:56.640,00:31:59.220
"Get the sum, a closed
form for the sum of i",00:31:59.220,00:32:01.440
squared x to the i?,00:32:01.440,00:32:04.160
"AUDIENCE: Do the
derivative method twice.",00:32:04.160,00:32:06.060
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, do it twice.",00:32:06.060,00:32:07.268
"Take this, which now you know.",00:32:07.268,00:32:08.946
Take the derivative again.,00:32:08.946,00:32:11.700
Won't be too hard.,00:32:11.700,00:32:12.880
"You can also take the version of
this where n goes to infinity.",00:32:18.530,00:32:23.980
Let's do that.,00:32:23.980,00:32:24.655
"If the absolute value of x
is less than 1, the sum i",00:32:30.120,00:32:34.900
"equals 1 to infinity of ix to
the i, what does that equal?",00:32:34.900,00:32:41.820
"This one, you can see
it easier up here.",00:32:44.560,00:32:46.356
"What happens when
n goes to infinity?",00:32:49.020,00:32:53.890
What does this do?,00:32:53.890,00:32:54.750
"X is less than 1,
an absolute value.",00:32:57.390,00:32:59.570
"What happens to this
as n goes to infinity?",00:32:59.570,00:33:02.920
This term.,00:33:02.920,00:33:03.420
"Goes to 0, right?",00:33:06.380,00:33:09.010
"This gets big, but this
gets smaller faster.",00:33:09.010,00:33:11.930
"What happens to this term
as n goes to infinity?",00:33:11.930,00:33:16.230
"Same thing, 0.",00:33:16.230,00:33:18.500
"All I'm left with is x
over 1 minus x squared.",00:33:18.500,00:33:20.920
"Now, this formula
is useful if you're",00:33:29.570,00:33:32.930
"trying to, say, get
the value of a company,",00:33:32.930,00:33:37.410
and the company is growing.,00:33:37.410,00:33:39.490
"Every year the company grows
its bottom line by m dollars.",00:33:39.490,00:33:44.850
"So the first year, the
company generates m dollars,",00:33:44.850,00:33:47.240
"the next year it generates
two m dollars in profit,",00:33:47.240,00:33:50.060
"the next year is
three m dollars.",00:33:50.060,00:33:52.136
"So you've got an
entity that every year",00:33:52.136,00:33:53.760
is growing by a fixed amount.,00:33:53.760,00:33:55.260
"It's not doubling every
year, but every year",00:33:55.260,00:33:57.870
"adds in m dollars
more of profit.",00:33:57.870,00:34:00.760
"What would you pay
to buy that company?",00:34:00.760,00:34:03.400
What is that worth?,00:34:03.400,00:34:05.550
"So you can think of this
as, again, an annuity.",00:34:05.550,00:34:08.305
"Here the annuity pays im
dollars, in this case,",00:34:13.900,00:34:25.090
"at the end, not the beginning,
say, of the year i forever.",00:34:25.090,00:34:32.250
"This company is-- or this
annuity-- is worth, well,",00:34:39.070,00:34:43.409
we just plug into the formula.,00:34:43.409,00:34:46.190
"Instead of $1 each year, it's
m so there's an m out front.",00:34:46.190,00:34:50.469
"x is 1 over 1 plus p, and
then we have 1 minus 1 over 1",00:34:50.469,00:34:58.490
plus p squared.,00:34:58.490,00:34:59.714
"And if we multiply the top and
bottom by 1 plus p squared,",00:35:02.620,00:35:06.840
"we get m 1 plus
p over p squared.",00:35:06.840,00:35:11.954
"So it's possible with
a very simple formula",00:35:15.190,00:35:17.816
"to figure out how
much you should",00:35:17.816,00:35:19.190
"spend to buy this company,
what its value is today.",00:35:19.190,00:35:22.730
"So, for example, say the company
was adding $50,000 a year",00:35:22.730,00:35:29.590
in profit.,00:35:29.590,00:35:31.650
"The interest rate was 6%,
the value of this company",00:35:31.650,00:35:37.300
"is $14 million-- $14.7
million, just plugging",00:35:37.300,00:35:45.510
into that formula.,00:35:45.510,00:35:47.960
"So people that buy
companies and stuff,",00:35:47.960,00:35:51.380
"they use formulas like this
to figure out what it's worth.",00:35:51.380,00:35:55.494
"Of course, you've
got to make sure",00:35:55.494,00:35:56.910
"it's really going to keep paying
the $50,000 more every year",00:35:56.910,00:36:01.704
"and that this is the
right interest rate",00:36:01.704,00:36:03.370
to be thinking about.,00:36:03.370,00:36:05.465

guys on Wall Street--",00:36:05.465,00:36:07.090
"the bankers on Wall
Street-- they all",00:36:07.090,00:36:08.631

put into these formulas.",00:36:12.670,00:36:16.200
Any questions about that?,00:36:16.200,00:36:19.410
Yeah.,00:36:19.410,00:36:20.715
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:36:20.715,00:36:22.247
PROFESSOR: OK.,00:36:22.247,00:36:22.830
Good.,00:36:22.830,00:36:24.290
So this one is OK?,00:36:24.290,00:36:27.170
OK.,00:36:27.170,00:36:28.040
"I plugged x equals
1 over 1 plus p,",00:36:28.040,00:36:32.910
"like we did before--
remember for the annuity--",00:36:32.910,00:36:34.920
"because every year
you're degrading it,",00:36:34.920,00:36:38.090
devaluing by 1 over 1 plus p.,00:36:38.090,00:36:40.430
"So that's the x term, and it's
paying-- in the i-th year,",00:36:40.430,00:36:47.160
it's paying im dollars.,00:36:47.160,00:36:51.400
All right?,00:36:51.400,00:36:52.250
"So the first year it pays n
dollars, the next year 2 m,",00:36:52.250,00:36:56.470
"the next year 3 m,
the next year 4 m,",00:36:56.470,00:37:00.830
"but every year you're
knocking it down by 1 plus 1",00:37:00.830,00:37:03.310
over p to the number of years.,00:37:03.310,00:37:06.070
"So what you get-- the sum
you've really got here--",00:37:06.070,00:37:11.520
"is i equals 1 to infinity,
im dollars are paid,",00:37:11.520,00:37:15.130
"but those dollars are
worth 1 over 1 plus p",00:37:15.130,00:37:18.300
"to the i today,
the current value.",00:37:18.300,00:37:21.152
That's a good question.,00:37:21.152,00:37:22.110
I should've said that.,00:37:22.110,00:37:24.350
That's a great question.,00:37:24.350,00:37:26.572
"So that's how we
connected this up,",00:37:26.572,00:37:28.030
"because you're getting paid
this much in our years,",00:37:28.030,00:37:31.130
"and that's worth
that much degradation",00:37:31.130,00:37:33.390
"or that much devaluation
today, and now we",00:37:33.390,00:37:35.740
add up a total current value.,00:37:35.740,00:37:38.930
"So even a company that is
paying you more and more",00:37:38.930,00:37:41.190
"every year still has a finite
value, because the extra--",00:37:41.190,00:37:47.220
"the payments are increasing
but only linearly.",00:37:47.220,00:37:49.990
"The value today is
decreasing geometrically,",00:37:49.990,00:37:52.670

wipes out the value",00:37:52.670,00:37:55.040
of the company in the future.,00:37:55.040,00:37:56.600
Yeah.,00:37:56.600,00:37:57.100

have done, right?",00:38:15.160,00:38:16.743
"Because I got 1 minus x is
1 minus 1 over 1 plus p.",00:38:16.743,00:38:20.600
"That gets squared, and now when
I multiply 1 plus p squared,",00:38:20.600,00:38:25.970
"it's multiplying
this by 1 plus p.",00:38:25.970,00:38:28.310
It's 1 plus p minus 1 is p.,00:38:28.310,00:38:30.630
So I have p squared.,00:38:30.630,00:38:32.342
"All right, so this part's OK.",00:38:32.342,00:38:33.550
That part I wrote wrong.,00:38:33.550,00:38:35.610
That's good.,00:38:35.610,00:38:36.280
Any other questions?,00:38:36.280,00:38:37.130
So let's do a simple example.,00:38:46.430,00:38:47.771
What is this sum?,00:39:03.230,00:39:04.710
"A 1/2 plus 2/4 plus
3/8 plus 4/16 forever.",00:39:14.026,00:39:23.580
What's that sum equal?,00:39:23.580,00:39:26.585
"You can plug that
in the formula.",00:39:32.970,00:39:35.975
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:39:35.975,00:39:38.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:39:38.060,00:39:40.440
That's right.,00:39:40.440,00:39:41.260
Good.,00:39:41.260,00:39:43.350
These details.,00:39:43.350,00:39:46.310
"Otherwise that
sum would be what?",00:39:46.310,00:39:48.156
"If I didn't put
the negative here,",00:39:48.156,00:39:50.640
"it's going to be infinity,
and that's not so interesting.",00:39:50.640,00:39:53.510
"The negative makes it more
interesting, so I got 1 over 2",00:39:53.510,00:39:55.970
to the i in there.,00:39:55.970,00:39:57.810
What's it worth then?,00:39:57.810,00:39:58.785
"Well, I can plug in the formula.",00:40:01.790,00:40:04.030
What's x?,00:40:04.030,00:40:06.650
One half.,00:40:06.650,00:40:07.760
"So I get 1/2 over 1 minus
1/2 squared is 1/2 over 1/4,",00:40:07.760,00:40:16.740
and that's 2.,00:40:16.740,00:40:17.690
Any questions on that formula?,00:40:24.710,00:40:28.925
"It's amazing how useful
these things get to be later.",00:40:28.925,00:40:31.280
"So that's sort of the
geometric kinds of things.",00:40:34.910,00:40:39.130
"Next I want to talk about more
of the arithmetic kinds of sums",00:40:39.130,00:40:43.160
and what you do there.,00:40:43.160,00:40:45.440
"In fact, we've already
seen one that we've done.",00:40:45.440,00:40:49.210
"If I sum i equals 1 to n of
i-- I think we've already",00:40:49.210,00:40:55.100
"done this one-- that's just
n times n plus 1 over 2,",00:40:55.100,00:40:59.500
"and probably most
of you even learned",00:40:59.500,00:41:01.170
"that formula back
in middle school,",00:41:01.170,00:41:03.380
I'm guessing-- maybe before.,00:41:03.380,00:41:07.220
"How many people know
the answer for this sum?",00:41:07.220,00:41:09.825
"The sum of the squares--
the first n squares.",00:41:15.000,00:41:17.765
Somebody knows.,00:41:17.765,00:41:18.390
What is it?,00:41:18.390,00:41:19.720
"AUDIENCE: n times n plus 1
times 2n plus 1, all over 6.",00:41:19.720,00:41:26.595
PROFESSOR: Very good.,00:41:26.595,00:41:27.470
That is correct.,00:41:27.470,00:41:29.160
"Most people don't
remember that one.",00:41:29.160,00:41:31.450
It's a little harder to derive.,00:41:31.450,00:41:35.140
"How would you prove
this by induction?",00:41:35.140,00:41:39.410
"Unfortunately, induction
doesn't tell you",00:41:39.410,00:41:41.200
"how to remember what
the formula was,",00:41:41.200,00:41:44.260
"and there's a couple of
ways you can go about that.",00:41:44.260,00:41:47.700
"One is, you can
remember or guess",00:41:47.700,00:41:50.460
"that the answer is
a polynomial in n.",00:41:50.460,00:41:53.222
"In fact, because
you're summing squares,",00:41:53.222,00:41:55.710
"you might guess that it's
a cubic polynomial in n,",00:41:55.710,00:42:00.100
"and if you remember just that
or guess just that, then you",00:42:00.100,00:42:03.890
"could actually plug in
values and get the answer.",00:42:03.890,00:42:08.540
"And this is-- you
know, a common method",00:42:08.540,00:42:10.870
"of solving these sums
is you sort of guess",00:42:10.870,00:42:12.850
the form of the solution.,00:42:12.850,00:42:15.010
"In this case you might
guess that for all n,",00:42:15.010,00:42:23.760
"the sum i equals 1 to n of
i squared equals a cubic.",00:42:23.760,00:42:29.166
"And then what you would do is
plug in the value n equals 1,",00:42:34.730,00:42:41.380
"n equals 2, maybe
even-- we'll make",00:42:41.380,00:42:43.860
"it n equals 0-- make
it simple and start",00:42:43.860,00:42:47.350
"getting some constraints
on the coefficients.",00:42:47.350,00:42:51.380
"If you would plug in n
equals 0, the sum is 0.",00:42:51.380,00:42:59.176
The polynomial evaluates to d.,00:43:02.300,00:43:06.250
"That tells you what d has got
to be right away. n equals 1.",00:43:06.250,00:43:10.160
"The sum is 1, and when you
plug into the polynomial,",00:43:10.160,00:43:14.050
you get a plus b plus c plus d.,00:43:14.050,00:43:18.760
n equals 2.,00:43:18.760,00:43:21.540
"Well, that's 1 plus
4 is 5, 2 cubed is 8,",00:43:21.540,00:43:26.710
"so you have 8a plus
4b plus 2c plus d,",00:43:26.710,00:43:32.680
"and you'll need one more since
you've got four variables.",00:43:32.680,00:43:36.720
"Let's see, 1 plus
4 plus 9 is 14.",00:43:36.720,00:43:40.950
"I've now got 3 cubed is
27a plus 9b plus 3c plus d.",00:43:40.950,00:43:50.690
"So now I've got four
equations and four variables",00:43:50.690,00:43:54.120
"and, with any luck, I can
solve that system of equations",00:43:54.120,00:43:57.360
and get the answer.,00:43:57.360,00:43:58.930
"And, in fact, you can.",00:43:58.930,00:44:00.090
"When you solve this system, you
get a equals 1/3, b equals 1/2,",00:44:00.090,00:44:07.300
"c equals 1/6, and d equals 0.",00:44:07.300,00:44:11.460
"And that's exactly what
you get in that formula.",00:44:11.460,00:44:14.970
"So that's a way to reproduce
the formula if you forgot it.",00:44:14.970,00:44:19.650
"Now, this method--
really to be sure you",00:44:19.650,00:44:23.410
"got the right answer--
you've got to go prove it",00:44:23.410,00:44:25.920
"by induction, because I
derived the answer-- if it",00:44:25.920,00:44:30.572
"was a polynomial, I would
have gotten it right,",00:44:30.572,00:44:32.530
"but I might be
wrong in my guess.",00:44:32.530,00:44:34.169
"And to make sure
your guess is right,",00:44:34.169,00:44:35.710
"you've got to go back
and use induction",00:44:35.710,00:44:37.335
to prove it for this approach.,00:44:37.335,00:44:38.762
Yeah.,00:44:38.762,00:44:39.262
"AUDIENCE: How do you know that
it would be [INAUDIBLE] and not",00:44:39.262,00:44:41.981
some higher power?,00:44:41.981,00:44:43.160
"PROFESSOR: Well, it turns
out that anytime you're",00:44:43.160,00:44:45.710
"summing powers, the answer
is a polynomial to one",00:44:45.710,00:44:49.630
higher degree.,00:44:49.630,00:44:51.540
"So if you just remembered that
fact, or you guessed that fact.",00:44:51.540,00:44:54.750
"Another way to sort of
imagine that might be true",00:44:54.750,00:44:58.000
"is that I'm getting
n of them, so I",00:44:58.000,00:45:01.120
"might be multiplying--
the top one is n squared,",00:45:01.120,00:45:04.500
"so I'm going to have n
of them about n squared.",00:45:04.500,00:45:07.900
Might be something like n cubed.,00:45:07.900,00:45:11.370
"That's another way you could
think of it, to guess that.",00:45:11.370,00:45:16.660
Any other questions on this?,00:45:16.660,00:45:20.186
"So far, all these sums had nice
closed forms, and a lot of them",00:45:25.130,00:45:29.970
"do that you'll encounter
later on, but not all,",00:45:29.970,00:45:33.410
"and sometimes you get sums that
don't have a nice closed form--",00:45:33.410,00:45:37.580
"at least nobody has
ever figured out one,",00:45:37.580,00:45:39.670
"and probably doesn't
always exist.",00:45:39.670,00:45:42.560
"For example, what if I
want to sum the first n",00:45:42.560,00:45:46.820
square roots of integers?,00:45:46.820,00:45:48.840
Let's write that down.,00:45:53.340,00:45:54.774
"So say I want a closed
form for this guy.",00:46:04.400,00:46:07.618
"Nobody knows an answer
for that, but there",00:46:13.560,00:46:17.340
"are ways of getting very
good, close bounds on it that",00:46:17.340,00:46:22.000
"are closed form, and
these are very important,",00:46:22.000,00:46:23.950
"and we're going to use
this the rest of today",00:46:23.950,00:46:26.060
and the rest of next time.,00:46:26.060,00:46:27.890
"And they're based on replacing
the sum with an integral,",00:46:27.890,00:46:32.740
"and the integral is very
close to the right answer,",00:46:32.740,00:46:35.140
"and then we can see what
the error terms are.",00:46:35.140,00:46:37.820
"So let's first look
at the case when",00:46:37.820,00:46:39.580
"we've got a sum where the
terms are increasing as i",00:46:39.580,00:46:42.560
"grows, and we'll call
these integration bounds,",00:46:42.560,00:46:54.240
"and a general sum will look
like this-- i equals 1 to n",00:46:54.240,00:46:57.790
"of f of i, and the first case is
when f is a positive increasing",00:46:57.790,00:47:04.870
"function, increasing in i.",00:47:04.870,00:47:13.150
"Integration bounds, and so
we're increasing function.",00:47:20.660,00:47:22.960
"So let me draw a picture
that will hopefully",00:47:28.160,00:47:31.530
"make the bounds that we're
going to get pretty easy.",00:47:31.530,00:47:34.060
"So let's draw the
sum here as follows.",00:47:47.550,00:47:53.590
"I've got 0, 1, 2, 3, n
minus 2, n minus 1, n,",00:47:53.590,00:48:04.360
and draw the values of f here.,00:48:04.360,00:48:06.840
"Here's f of 1, f of 2--
it's increasing-- f of 3,",00:48:06.840,00:48:17.260
"f of n minus 1, and f of n.",00:48:17.260,00:48:19.550
"Then I'll draw the
rectangles here.",00:48:23.180,00:48:27.630
"So this has area of f of
1, this has area f of 2,",00:48:31.640,00:48:38.620
"this has area f of 3,
and we keep on going.",00:48:38.620,00:48:43.630
"Let's see, this will
be f of n minus 2",00:48:43.630,00:48:47.070
"on this one-- I'll just do f of
n minus 1, draw this guy here.",00:48:47.070,00:48:50.775
"So its unit width, its
height is f of n minus 1,",00:48:53.950,00:48:56.670
"so its area is f of n
minus 1, and then f of n.",00:48:56.670,00:49:03.136
"And let me also--
so the sum of f of i",00:49:05.690,00:49:11.240
is the areas in the rectangles.,00:49:11.240,00:49:14.500
"That's what the
sum is, and I want",00:49:14.500,00:49:16.760
"to get bounds on this
sum using the integral,",00:49:16.760,00:49:21.120
"because integrals are
easier to compute.",00:49:21.120,00:49:23.510
"So let's draw the function
f of x from 1 to n.",00:49:23.510,00:49:28.740
"All right, so this is
f of x as a function.",00:49:35.720,00:49:39.765
"Now I claim that the sum
i equals 1 to n of f of i",00:49:42.380,00:49:51.910
"is at least f of 1 plus
the integral from 1 to n,",00:49:51.910,00:49:57.610
"f of x, dx.",00:49:57.610,00:49:58.870
"Now, the integral
from 1 to n of f of x",00:50:01.570,00:50:07.590
"is this stuff, the
stuff under the curve.",00:50:07.590,00:50:10.786
"It comes down here,
starts at 1, and it's",00:50:10.786,00:50:14.930
the stuff under the curve.,00:50:14.930,00:50:17.760
"And what I'm saying
here is that if you",00:50:17.760,00:50:19.410
"take that stuff under
the curve and add",00:50:19.410,00:50:21.490
"f of 1, which is
this piece, that's",00:50:21.490,00:50:25.000
a lower bound on our sum.,00:50:25.000,00:50:28.230
The sum's bigger than that.,00:50:28.230,00:50:31.140
"So what I'm saying is the
area in the rectangles",00:50:31.140,00:50:34.620
"is at least as big as the
area in the first rectangle",00:50:34.620,00:50:38.440
plus the area under the curve.,00:50:38.440,00:50:42.250
Does everybody see why that is?,00:50:42.250,00:50:45.190
"I'm saying the sum is the
area in the rectangles, right?",00:50:45.190,00:50:49.340
That's pretty clear.,00:50:49.340,00:50:51.050
"And that is at least as big
as the first rectangle f of 1",00:50:51.050,00:50:56.760
"plus the stuff under the
curve, which is the integral,",00:50:56.760,00:51:00.730
"and I've left-- I've
chopped off these guys.",00:51:00.730,00:51:03.040
That's extra.,00:51:03.040,00:51:04.500
OK?,00:51:04.500,00:51:06.410
Is that all right?,00:51:06.410,00:51:07.710
So lower bound.,00:51:07.710,00:51:10.200
"Any questions on
the lower bound?",00:51:10.200,00:51:12.510
"This is a picture proof, which
we always tell you not to do,",00:51:12.510,00:51:16.120
but we're going to do one here.,00:51:16.120,00:51:18.456
"And, of course, it totally hides
why did I need f is increasing,",00:51:21.830,00:51:26.119
but we'll see that in a minute.,00:51:26.119,00:51:27.410
"The proof would not work
unless it is increasing here.",00:51:27.410,00:51:29.936
"Any questions,
because now going I'm",00:51:32.840,00:51:34.340
"going to do the other
bound, the other side.",00:51:34.340,00:51:37.390
"I also claim-- this will be
a little trickier to see--",00:51:37.390,00:51:41.300
"that the sum is at most f of n
plus the integral from 1 to n.",00:51:41.300,00:51:49.230
"So this is the lower
bound add in f of 1,",00:51:53.420,00:51:56.110
"the upper bound
just add in f of n.",00:51:56.110,00:51:57.810
So let's see why that's true.,00:51:57.810,00:52:00.440
"Now, to see that,
this is-- I'm not",00:52:00.440,00:52:03.140
going to be able to draw it.,00:52:03.140,00:52:05.400
"I want you to imagine taking
this curve and the area",00:52:05.400,00:52:08.420
"under it, down to here, and
sliding it left one unit.",00:52:08.420,00:52:16.480
"sliding it left to here, sliding
it left one unit over to here.",00:52:16.480,00:52:23.967
"Now, when I slide it left one
unit, did the area under it",00:52:26.950,00:52:30.980
change?,00:52:30.980,00:52:33.750
No.,00:52:33.750,00:52:34.280
"It's the same area
under it, just where",00:52:34.280,00:52:36.860
"it sits on the picture
is now out here.",00:52:36.860,00:52:39.790
"It's this area under this
guy, but it's the same thing,",00:52:42.950,00:52:45.320
its the same integral.,00:52:45.320,00:52:47.300
"And you can see that
it's more than what's",00:52:47.300,00:52:50.680
"in these rectangles, because
I got all this stuff.",00:52:50.680,00:52:55.110
"And, of course, I didn't
even include this,",00:52:55.110,00:52:57.050
so now I add the f n.,00:52:57.050,00:53:01.040
"So if I take the area under the
curve, which is the integral,",00:53:01.040,00:53:04.640
"shift it left one,
so it only goes up",00:53:04.640,00:53:06.450
"to here now, and then add in
this rectangle, that dominates",00:53:06.450,00:53:11.100
the area in the rectangles.,00:53:11.100,00:53:14.590
Bigger than.,00:53:14.590,00:53:15.110
Do you see that?,00:53:18.890,00:53:19.791
"I could do a lot of
equations on the board",00:53:23.271,00:53:25.020
"but, for sure, that would
be hopeless to follow.",00:53:25.020,00:53:29.550
Any questions about this?,00:53:29.550,00:53:31.160
Yeah.,00:53:31.160,00:53:31.896
"AUDIENCE: I guess I understand
the lower amounts because we're",00:53:31.896,00:53:35.088
cutting off the triangles.,00:53:35.088,00:53:36.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:53:36.460,00:53:38.360
"But is there-- is it
a lot of hand waving,",00:53:38.360,00:53:42.760
"or am I just missing something,
that it's always going to be",00:53:42.760,00:53:45.660
the f of n is what we--,00:53:45.660,00:53:48.004
PROFESSOR: Yeah.,00:53:48.004,00:53:48.670
"There's a little
hand waving going on,",00:53:48.670,00:53:50.750
but I do believe it is true.,00:53:50.750,00:53:53.076
"With equations you
can make it precise.",00:53:53.076,00:53:54.700
"Let's look at it again,
do this one more time.",00:53:54.700,00:53:57.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],00:53:57.876,00:53:59.482
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, I'm
waving hands a little bit,",00:53:59.482,00:54:01.440
"but it also-- hopefully
the intuition comes across,",00:54:01.440,00:54:04.940
"because when I
shift left by one,",00:54:04.940,00:54:10.220
"this point becomes this
point, and that point becomes",00:54:10.220,00:54:13.230
"that point, and
I'm catching sort",00:54:13.230,00:54:16.300
"of the cusp of these rectangles,
and now I take this curve here,",00:54:16.300,00:54:24.300
"shifting the whole
curve left one unit,",00:54:24.300,00:54:28.120
and the area doesn't change.,00:54:28.120,00:54:30.430
"It would be equivalent of
taking the integral from 0",00:54:30.430,00:54:33.010
to n minus 1.,00:54:33.010,00:54:35.170
"You notice what I'm
doing-- of f of x plus 1.",00:54:35.170,00:54:38.809
"There's another way to
look at it mathematically,",00:54:38.809,00:54:40.850
"maybe-- probably the
formal way to do it--",00:54:40.850,00:54:43.410
"but the idea is that
this now contains",00:54:43.410,00:54:46.060
"all these first n
minus 1 rectangles,",00:54:46.060,00:54:48.580
are contained underneath it.,00:54:48.580,00:54:51.180
"And then I just add this
in, and I'm good to go.",00:54:51.180,00:54:55.580
"I've contained all
the rectangles now",00:54:55.580,00:54:57.370
for the upper bounds.,00:54:57.370,00:55:00.577
"All right,
mathematically what this",00:55:00.577,00:55:02.035
"is, this curve is
0 to n minus 1,",00:55:02.035,00:55:06.270
"fx plus 1, which is the
same thing as what that is.",00:55:06.270,00:55:10.570
Any questions for that?,00:55:13.810,00:55:19.180
"But now I have good
bounds on the sum.",00:55:19.180,00:55:23.160
"We know that the sum is at
least this and at most that,",00:55:23.160,00:55:28.100
"and those two bounds only differ
by a single term in the sum,",00:55:28.100,00:55:33.990
so they're very close.,00:55:33.990,00:55:36.124
"These actually are good
formulas to write down",00:55:36.124,00:55:38.040
for your crib sheet.,00:55:38.040,00:55:38.873
"That is worth doing on the test,
and we'll use them more today,",00:55:38.873,00:55:48.880
"and we'll also use
them on Thursday.",00:55:48.880,00:55:51.333
"So now we can actually
get close bounds",00:55:56.730,00:55:59.400
on the sum of the square roots.,00:55:59.400,00:56:02.850
"So let's see how
this works for f",00:56:02.850,00:56:06.365
"of i equal to the square root
of i, which is increasing.",00:56:06.365,00:56:11.120
"So I compute the integral from
1 to n of square root of x dx,",00:56:11.120,00:56:17.470
"and that's just x to the 3/2
over 3/2, evaluated at n and 1,",00:56:17.470,00:56:24.960
"and that just equals 2/3
n to the 3/2 minus 1.",00:56:24.960,00:56:32.660
"And now I can compute
the bounds on the sum",00:56:32.660,00:56:35.820
of the first n square roots.,00:56:35.820,00:56:37.160
"So I know that square root
i equals 1 to n-- well,",00:56:39.920,00:56:47.750
"the upper bound is f
n plus the integral,",00:56:47.750,00:56:57.000
"and the lower bound is f
of 1 plus the integral.",00:56:57.000,00:57:02.204
What is f of n?,00:57:07.590,00:57:09.390
That's the square root of n.,00:57:12.280,00:57:15.150
What is f of 1?,00:57:15.150,00:57:18.330
"The square root
of 1, which is 1.",00:57:18.330,00:57:21.860
So I'll plug that in here.,00:57:21.860,00:57:24.310
"I get 2/3 n to the 3/2 plus
1 minus 2/3 is plus 1/3,",00:57:24.310,00:57:34.440
"and here I get 2/3 n to the
3/2 plus the square root",00:57:34.440,00:57:41.020
of n minus 2/3.,00:57:41.020,00:57:42.798
"So now I have pretty good
bounds on the sum of the first n",00:57:46.210,00:57:49.840
square roots using this method.,00:57:49.840,00:57:54.320
"So for example,
take n equals 100.",00:57:54.320,00:58:03.180
This number evaluates to 667.,00:58:03.180,00:58:07.270
"This number evaluates to
676, and the difference",00:58:07.270,00:58:12.130
"is 9, which is the square
root of 100 minus 1.",00:58:12.130,00:58:16.290
"This is the square
root of n, this is 1,",00:58:16.290,00:58:20.010
"so the gap here, square root
of n minus 1, and n equals 100.",00:58:20.010,00:58:24.210
"Square root of 100 minus
1 is 9, so I shouldn't be",00:58:24.210,00:58:26.430
surprised my gap here is nine.,00:58:26.430,00:58:28.642
"So I didn't get exactly
the right answer,",00:58:28.642,00:58:30.350
but I'm pretty close here.,00:58:30.350,00:58:33.055
"Now, as n grows, what happens to
the gap between the upper bound",00:58:36.030,00:58:44.670
and the lower bound?,00:58:44.670,00:58:47.820
What does it do?,00:58:47.820,00:58:49.370
It gets bigger.,00:58:49.370,00:58:51.000
So my gap gets bigger.,00:58:51.000,00:58:53.010
That's not so nice.,00:58:53.010,00:58:54.490
"Doesn't always stay 9
forever, but somehow",00:58:54.490,00:58:59.610
"though this is still pretty
good, because the gap grows",00:58:59.610,00:59:04.890
"but the gap only grows
as square root of n,",00:59:04.890,00:59:09.420
"where the answer-- the bounds--
are growing as n to the 3/2.",00:59:09.420,00:59:14.670
"In other words, my error
is somewhere around here,",00:59:14.670,00:59:19.500
"and that gets smaller
compared to my answer, which",00:59:19.500,00:59:23.150
is somewhere around there.,00:59:23.150,00:59:25.970
"And there's a special
notation that people use.",00:59:25.970,00:59:30.010
"In fact, let's write that
down and then do the notation.",00:59:30.010,00:59:33.491
"Another way of writing this is
that the sum i equals 1 to n",00:59:45.570,00:59:54.440
of square root of i.,00:59:54.440,00:59:56.820
"The leading term here
is 2/3 n to the 3/2,",00:59:56.820,01:00:02.670
"and then there's some error
term-- delta term here.",01:00:02.670,01:00:05.630
"We'll call that
delta n, and we know",01:00:05.630,01:00:09.830
"that the error term is at
least 1/3 and, at most,",01:00:09.830,01:00:19.169
the square root of n minus 2/3.,01:00:19.169,01:00:20.460
"So this delta term is bound
by the square root of n.",01:00:25.100,01:00:29.090
"That's getting
bigger as n gets big,",01:00:29.090,01:00:31.220
"but this value compared to
your answer is getting small.",01:00:31.220,01:00:36.920
"That's nice, and so the way that
gets represented is as follows.",01:00:36.920,01:00:41.969
"We would say-- it's using
that tilde notation.",01:00:41.969,01:00:43.885
"We write tilde 2/3
times n to the 3/2,",01:00:46.620,01:00:51.960
"and now we've gotten
rid of the delta,",01:00:51.960,01:00:53.620
"because this tilde is
telling us that everything",01:00:53.620,01:00:55.830
"else out here gets small
compared to this as n gets big.",01:00:55.830,01:01:01.500
"And the formal definition--
Let's write out",01:01:01.500,01:01:04.260
the formal definition for it.,01:01:04.260,01:01:06.031
"Now, a lot of times
you'll see people",01:01:22.720,01:01:24.670
use this symbol to mean about.,01:01:24.670,01:01:27.170
That's informal.,01:01:27.170,01:01:28.790
"When I'm using it here,
it's a very formal meaning",01:01:28.790,01:01:31.975
mathematically.,01:01:31.975,01:01:32.600
"A function g of x is
tilde, a function h of x",01:01:35.580,01:01:42.930
"means that the limit as x goes
to infinity of g over h is 1.",01:01:42.930,01:01:56.840
"In other words, that
as x goes to infinity--",01:01:56.840,01:01:58.750
"as x gets big-- the ratio
of these guys becomes 1.",01:01:58.750,01:02:04.480
"And let's see if
that's true here.",01:02:04.480,01:02:05.990
"Well, square root
of i equals this,",01:02:09.040,01:02:12.930
"so I need to show the limit
of this over that is 1.",01:02:12.930,01:02:17.730
So let's check that.,01:02:17.730,01:02:20.550
"A limit as n goes to
infinity of 2/3 n to the 3/2",01:02:20.550,01:02:26.360
"plus that delta term
over 2/3 n to the 3/2.",01:02:26.360,01:02:33.710
"Well, that equals-- divide out
by 2/3 n to the 3/2, I get a 1.",01:02:33.710,01:02:38.565
"Did I-- should I
have subtracted?",01:02:45.776,01:02:47.150
"No, that's OK.",01:02:47.150,01:02:49.830
"One plus delta n over
2/3 n to the 3/2.",01:02:49.830,01:02:57.850
"If I can pull the 1 out front,
that's 1 plus the limit,",01:02:57.850,01:03:02.090
"and this is now delta n is
at most square root of n,",01:03:02.090,01:03:05.840
"so I get square root of
n over 2/3 n to the 3/2.",01:03:05.840,01:03:11.860
"Square root of n over n to
the 3/2, that goes to 0.",01:03:11.860,01:03:17.110
So this equals 1.,01:03:17.110,01:03:18.530
"So this limit is 1,
and so therefore I",01:03:22.280,01:03:24.440
"can say that the sum of
the first n square roots",01:03:24.440,01:03:28.140
is tilde 2/3 n to the 3/2.,01:03:28.140,01:03:32.500
Any questions about this?,01:03:32.500,01:03:35.320
"We're going to do a lot of this
kind of notation next time.",01:03:35.320,01:03:38.050
Yeah.,01:03:38.050,01:03:39.190
"AUDIENCE: When you
took the integral",01:03:39.190,01:03:40.690
"and got 2/3 into
the 3/2 minus 1,",01:03:40.690,01:03:44.460
"why did the minus 1 not become
part of the actual solution",01:03:44.460,01:03:49.050
and become part of the delta?,01:03:49.050,01:03:51.317
PROFESSOR: OK.,01:03:51.317,01:03:51.900
"So you brought it
up to here, right?",01:03:51.900,01:03:54.500
OK.,01:03:54.500,01:03:55.360

into the integral that",01:03:55.360,01:03:59.410
"appears on both sides here,
and here I add the f 1,",01:03:59.410,01:04:01.790

have the lower bound here",01:04:01.790,01:04:06.439

Are you good with those?,01:04:07.480,01:04:09.090
All right.,01:04:09.090,01:04:09.590
"Now some judgment takes
place, and what I'm really",01:04:09.590,01:04:12.880
"trying to do here is figure out
what are the important terms",01:04:12.880,01:04:17.590

growing as n gets big?",01:04:20.250,01:04:23.440

1/3 is not doing much.",01:04:23.440,01:04:28.350
"As n gets big, the
square root of n",01:04:28.350,01:04:30.730
"grows, but it's nothing
like what's happening here.",01:04:30.730,01:04:34.370
"If you had to
describe to somebody",01:04:34.370,01:04:35.820
"what's going on in this bound,
would you start here or here?",01:04:35.820,01:04:40.491
No.,01:04:40.491,01:04:40.990
You'd start here.,01:04:40.990,01:04:41.698
"This is the action, and there's
a little bit-- the rest is just",01:04:41.698,01:04:44.750
"in the slop, in the air.",01:04:44.750,01:04:46.600
"And so now I've used judgement
to say that delta is somewhere",01:04:46.600,01:04:51.080
in this stuff here.,01:04:51.080,01:04:53.414
"What's really happening, and
the nice thing is they match.",01:04:53.414,01:04:55.830
"The lower bound and the upper
bound match on that term.",01:04:55.830,01:04:59.770
"So what I do is I write
it equals this term",01:04:59.770,01:05:04.750
"plus something that's
smaller and, in particular,",01:05:04.750,01:05:10.390
"it's between 1/3 and
square root of n minus 2/3.",01:05:10.390,01:05:14.080
All right.,01:05:14.080,01:05:14.780
"So what I'm trying
to capture here",01:05:14.780,01:05:16.890
"is just the guts of what's
happening to this function",01:05:16.890,01:05:20.730

the same, and we'll",01:05:39.260,01:05:41.980

"You take the integral, you add
f of 1 for the lower bound,",01:06:01.790,01:06:05.650
"you add f of n for
the upper bound,",01:06:05.650,01:06:07.974
"and it's in between,
somewhere in there.",01:06:07.974,01:06:09.640
Questions there?,01:06:12.570,01:06:14.960
All right.,01:06:14.960,01:06:15.470
"Then we plugged
it in, and now we",01:06:15.470,01:06:18.590
"look at this tilde notation
that says-- well, first we'd",01:06:18.590,01:06:22.149
write it like this.,01:06:22.149,01:06:22.940
"The sum is this value plus an
error term and, lo and behold,",01:06:22.940,01:06:27.390
that error term is small.,01:06:27.390,01:06:30.840
"If I take the limit of the whole
thing divided by the big term,",01:06:30.840,01:06:34.480
"I get 1, which means this
thing is really not important.",01:06:34.480,01:06:38.780
So I write this.,01:06:38.780,01:06:39.732
Questions on that?,01:06:42.630,01:06:45.840
All right.,01:06:45.840,01:06:48.500
"There's one more
case to consider,",01:06:48.500,01:06:51.375
"and now we're going to go back
to the integration bounds,",01:06:51.375,01:06:53.750
"and that is when f is
a decreasing function,",01:06:53.750,01:06:57.557
"and we're going to do
the analysis for that,",01:06:57.557,01:06:59.390
and then we'll be all done.,01:06:59.390,01:07:00.515
"So we're going to look
at integration bounds",01:07:04.480,01:07:09.740
"when f is decreasing
and positive still.",01:07:09.740,01:07:13.670
"The example here might
be, for example, the sum i",01:07:25.660,01:07:34.810
"equals 1 to n, 1 over
the square root of i.",01:07:34.810,01:07:40.260
"Say you had to get some idea
of how fast that function is",01:07:40.260,01:07:43.550
growing as a function of n.,01:07:43.550,01:07:45.970
"I'm summing the first n
inverse as the square roots.",01:07:45.970,01:07:52.996
"What is that
roughly going to be?",01:07:52.996,01:07:54.370
"How fast does that grow
as a function of n?",01:07:54.370,01:07:57.860
So let's do that.,01:07:57.860,01:07:58.981
"And, of course, 1
over square root of i",01:08:02.256,01:08:03.880
decreases as i gets bigger.,01:08:03.880,01:08:08.500
"So let's do the general picture
again and see what happens.",01:08:08.500,01:08:15.990
"So we have 0, 1, 2, 3, n minus
2, n minus 1, n, and now f of n",01:08:15.990,01:08:28.790
"is the small term and f of n
minus 1, f of 3 here, f of 1.",01:08:28.790,01:08:43.090
"Now, I'm going to
draw the rectangle.",01:08:43.090,01:08:45.250
This has area f of 1.,01:08:45.250,01:08:49.470
This one has area f of 2.,01:08:49.470,01:08:52.182
"This one has area f of
3, and then this one",01:08:55.080,01:09:03.130
"has area f of n minus 1 here,
and then, lastly, area f of n.",01:09:03.130,01:09:14.279
"So the sum is the area in the
rectangles, just like before,",01:09:14.279,01:09:18.819
"except now the rectangles
are getting smaller.",01:09:18.819,01:09:22.020
"Let's draw the integral
like we did before.",01:09:22.020,01:09:27.350
"The integral is the area
under this curve, f of x here,",01:09:27.350,01:09:32.380
just like before.,01:09:32.380,01:09:33.362
"So this is f of x,
only it's decreasing.",01:09:35.960,01:09:39.114
"Now, let's take the area under
this curve, and add f of 1",01:09:41.840,01:09:49.670
to it.,01:09:49.670,01:09:51.540
"If I take the area under
this curve, all the way",01:09:51.540,01:09:54.910
"down to here and then add
f of 1, what do I get?",01:09:54.910,01:10:00.780
Upper bound on my sum.,01:10:04.440,01:10:07.791
OK.,01:10:07.791,01:10:08.290
"So the sum i equals
1 to n f of i",01:10:08.290,01:10:13.460
"is upper bounded by that
guy, which is f of 1,",01:10:13.460,01:10:19.610
"plus my integral, which is
the area under the curve.",01:10:19.610,01:10:27.520
"The integral is the area under
that curve, starting here,",01:10:27.520,01:10:31.400
"and that contains
all these rectangles,",01:10:31.400,01:10:35.110
"and then I just add in f
of 1 to get an upper bound.",01:10:35.110,01:10:38.126
"Now, for the lower bound,
think about shifting",01:10:41.540,01:10:44.750
the whole curve left by one.,01:10:44.750,01:10:47.830
"That goes to there,
this goes to here,",01:10:47.830,01:10:51.190
"that goes to here, that goes to
there, and that goes to there.",01:10:51.190,01:10:56.740
"The area under the
curve did not change",01:10:56.740,01:10:59.200
when I shifted it left by one.,01:10:59.200,01:11:02.710
"This is now my area
under the curve.",01:11:02.710,01:11:06.760
Stops here.,01:11:06.760,01:11:08.830
"What do I get when I take that
area and add in this last box,",01:11:08.830,01:11:12.800
f of n?,01:11:12.800,01:11:16.570
"A lower bound,
because it's contained",01:11:16.570,01:11:19.699
in all the rectangles.,01:11:19.699,01:11:20.615
"Now, what's really weird
about these formulas,",01:11:30.900,01:11:36.492
do they look familiar?,01:11:36.492,01:11:37.408
Yeah.,01:11:40.280,01:11:41.780
Yeah.,01:11:41.780,01:11:43.300
I switched them.,01:11:43.300,01:11:44.961
Yeah.,01:11:44.961,01:11:45.460
"They're the same formulas
we had over here,",01:11:45.460,01:11:48.870
"except we switched the direction
on the less than and greater",01:11:48.870,01:11:51.730
than signs.,01:11:51.730,01:11:53.970
"Well, I swapped f of 1
and f of n, however you",01:11:53.970,01:11:56.000
want to think about it.,01:11:56.000,01:11:57.280
"The lower bound
here in that case",01:11:57.280,01:12:00.570
"became the upper
bound in this case.",01:12:00.570,01:12:05.000
"Is that possible that the lower
bound became the upper bound?",01:12:05.000,01:12:09.330
Yeah.,01:12:09.330,01:12:09.880
"Yeah, because what
really happened here--",01:12:09.880,01:12:11.910
"which is the big term
in this case, fn or f1?",01:12:11.910,01:12:15.240
"f1 is the big term
because it's decreasing,",01:12:15.240,01:12:17.290
so it's totally symmetric.,01:12:17.290,01:12:19.650
All right?,01:12:19.650,01:12:20.680
"The proof was very
similar, so the nice thing",01:12:20.680,01:12:22.970
"is you've only got to remember
the bounds are now simple",01:12:22.970,01:12:25.710
"for any sum as long as an
increasing or decreasing, it's",01:12:25.710,01:12:28.730
the same as the integral.,01:12:28.730,01:12:30.490
"The lower bound is the smaller
of the first and last term,",01:12:30.490,01:12:33.920
"and the upper bounds are larger
of the first and last term.",01:12:33.920,01:12:36.650
Very easy to remember.,01:12:36.650,01:12:37.930
"Probably don't even
need the crib sheet",01:12:37.930,01:12:39.554
"for it, although to be safe,
want to write that down.",01:12:39.554,01:12:46.200
"So now it's easy to compute
good bounds on the sum",01:12:46.200,01:12:50.060
of the inverse square roots.,01:12:50.060,01:12:51.550
"Any questions there
before I go do it?",01:13:02.020,01:13:08.530
"So let's take the case
where we're summing 1",01:13:08.530,01:13:11.440
over square root of i.,01:13:11.440,01:13:12.600
"So we compute the integral of
1 over square root of x dx.",01:13:15.360,01:13:22.970
"That equals the square root of x
over 1/2, evaluated at n and 1.",01:13:22.970,01:13:29.500
"That equals 2 square
root of n minus 1,",01:13:29.500,01:13:33.650
"or two square root of n minus
2, and now we can bound the sum.",01:13:33.650,01:13:40.465
"The upper bound is f
of 1 plus the integral.",01:13:48.650,01:13:54.380
"The lower bound is f
of n plus the integral.",01:13:54.380,01:13:58.975
What is f of 1?,01:14:02.420,01:14:05.770
One?,01:14:05.770,01:14:08.070
"One over the square
root of 1 is 1.",01:14:08.070,01:14:09.530
What is f of n?,01:14:09.530,01:14:10.440
One over the square root of n.,01:14:14.120,01:14:15.400
Small.,01:14:15.400,01:14:17.350
"So these bounds are
pretty close here, right?",01:14:17.350,01:14:20.290
"In fact, this gets really
tiny as n gets big,",01:14:20.290,01:14:22.355
"so I'm just going
to replace this",01:14:22.355,01:14:23.730
"with 2 square root of n minus
2 and make it a strict lower",01:14:23.730,01:14:26.570
"bound, and this--
cancel there-- I",01:14:26.570,01:14:30.185
get 2 square root of n minus 1.,01:14:30.185,01:14:34.350
"Wow, these bounds are great.",01:14:34.350,01:14:36.050
They're within one for all n.,01:14:36.050,01:14:40.280
That's really good.,01:14:40.280,01:14:43.260
"So we can rewrite this in
terms of what really matters.",01:14:43.260,01:14:48.570
"What really matters
in these bounds?",01:14:48.570,01:14:52.510
"How fast is this
function growing?",01:14:52.510,01:14:54.560
AUDIENCE: 2 root n.,01:14:54.560,01:14:55.420
PROFESSOR: 2 root n.,01:14:55.420,01:14:56.000
"That's what really matters,
so let's write that down.",01:14:56.000,01:14:58.208
"So this says that the
sum i equals 1 to n",01:15:06.020,01:15:09.506
"of 1 over square root i
equals 2 square root of n-- we",01:15:09.506,01:15:16.926
"have a minus delta n, where
delta is between 1 and 2.",01:15:16.926,01:15:26.990

notation, what would I",01:15:26.990,01:15:33.990
write down here for the tilde?,01:15:33.990,01:15:36.210

AUDIENCE: Tilde.,01:15:39.970,01:15:40.110
"PROFESSOR: --I don't
want to keep track of all",01:15:40.110,01:15:41.026
the delta stuff as n gets big.,01:15:41.026,01:15:42.599
AUDIENCE: 2 root n.,01:15:42.599,01:15:43.390
"PROFESSOR: 2 root
n, because this term",01:15:43.390,01:15:48.420
"over that goes to 0 as
n gets large, so let's",01:15:48.420,01:15:52.310
just check that.,01:15:52.310,01:15:53.090
"So we take the limit as n
goes to infinity of 2 root",01:15:56.630,01:16:01.530
n minus delta n over 2 root n.,01:16:01.530,01:16:06.235
"I'm just checking
the definition now.",01:16:06.235,01:16:08.150
"That's what the
definition would be.",01:16:08.150,01:16:11.020
"Equals 1 minus the
limit as n goes",01:16:11.020,01:16:17.380
to infinity of 2 over 2 root n.,01:16:17.380,01:16:21.200
This is 0.,01:16:21.200,01:16:23.250
So it equals 1.,01:16:23.250,01:16:25.750
"And so now you know that the
sum of the first n inverse",01:16:25.750,01:16:29.740
"square roots grows as 2 root
n, which is the integral.",01:16:29.740,01:16:32.858
Yeah.,01:16:32.858,01:16:33.357
"AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] dropped
off the lower bound that f of n",01:16:33.357,01:16:37.030
was 1 over root n?,01:16:37.030,01:16:38.610
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, I dropped it
off, because it was so tiny",01:16:38.610,01:16:42.400
"and going to zero, I just
made a strict less than.",01:16:42.400,01:16:45.150
"In fact, yes.",01:16:45.150,01:16:45.850
"I don't hurt myself
by dropping it off.",01:16:45.850,01:16:48.810
"In fact, the lower
bound was a little bit--",01:16:48.810,01:16:51.040
"I made a little
weaker lower bound.",01:16:51.040,01:16:53.210
So this is still true.,01:16:53.210,01:16:54.836
"I just-- it wasn't as
tight as it used to be,",01:16:54.836,01:16:56.710
so I could keep it around.,01:16:56.710,01:16:59.474
"Yeah, it doesn't hurt
to keep it around,",01:16:59.474,01:17:01.140
"then it's a less
than or equal there.",01:17:01.140,01:17:04.280
"And now this would be
something like that.",01:17:04.280,01:17:10.765
"So I could keep it around,
but I'm going to get rid of it",01:17:10.765,01:17:13.140

"I took something away, so I
know I could never equal this,",01:17:52.480,01:17:55.550

bigger than this.",01:17:55.550,01:17:58.760
"I know that the real answer
has to be at least this big,",01:17:58.760,01:18:01.710
