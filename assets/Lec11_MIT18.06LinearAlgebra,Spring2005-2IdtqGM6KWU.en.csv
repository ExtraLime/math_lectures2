"This is linear algebra
lecture eleven.",00:00:11.700,00:00:17.050
"And at the end of lecture ten,
I was talking about some vector",00:00:17.050,00:00:22.760
"spaces, but they're --",00:00:22.760,00:00:26.880
"the things in
those vector spaces",00:00:26.880,00:00:29.070
"were not what we
usually call vectors.",00:00:29.070,00:00:33.180
"Nevertheless, you
could add them and you",00:00:33.180,00:00:36.010
"could multiply by numbers,
so we can call them vectors.",00:00:36.010,00:00:40.230
"I think the example
I was working",00:00:40.230,00:00:41.970
with they were matrices.,00:00:41.970,00:00:44.100
"So the -- so we had
like a matrix space,",00:00:44.100,00:00:46.990
"the space of all three
by three matrices.",00:00:46.990,00:00:50.230
"And I'd like to just pick
up on that, because --",00:00:50.230,00:00:55.530
"we've been so specific about
n dimensional space here,",00:00:55.530,00:01:00.600
"and you really want to see that
the same ideas work as long",00:01:00.600,00:01:05.640
"as you can add and
multiply by scalars.",00:01:05.640,00:01:09.270
"So these new, new vector
spaces, the example I took",00:01:09.270,00:01:16.640
"was the space M of all
three by three matrices.",00:01:16.640,00:01:24.085
OK.,00:01:26.900,00:01:29.230
"I can add them, I can
multiply by scalars.",00:01:29.230,00:01:32.630
"I can multiply two of them
together, but I don't do that.",00:01:32.630,00:01:36.380
"That's not part of the
vector space picture.",00:01:36.380,00:01:38.710
"The vector space part is
just adding the matrices",00:01:38.710,00:01:43.420
and multiplying by numbers.,00:01:43.420,00:01:45.690
"And that's fine, we stay
within this space of three",00:01:45.690,00:01:50.540
by three matrices.,00:01:50.540,00:01:52.220
"And I had some subspaces
that were interesting,",00:01:52.220,00:01:56.050
"like the symmetric, the
subspace of symmetric matrices,",00:01:56.050,00:02:02.850
symmetric three by threes.,00:02:02.850,00:02:05.600
"Or the subspace of upper
triangular three by threes.",00:02:05.600,00:02:13.420
"Now I, I use the word subspace
because it follows the rule.",00:02:13.420,00:02:21.540
"If I add two symmetric
matrices, I'm still symmetric.",00:02:21.540,00:02:25.240
"If I multiply two
symmetric matrices,",00:02:25.240,00:02:27.680
"is the product
automatically symmetric?",00:02:27.680,00:02:30.900
No.,00:02:30.900,00:02:31.870
"But I'm not
multiplying matrices.",00:02:31.870,00:02:34.510
I'm just adding.,00:02:34.510,00:02:35.180
So I'm fine.,00:02:35.180,00:02:36.900
This is a subspace.,00:02:36.900,00:02:38.430
"Similarly, if I add two
upper triangular matrices,",00:02:38.430,00:02:42.320
I'm still upper triangular.,00:02:42.320,00:02:45.400
"And, that's a subspace.",00:02:45.400,00:02:48.630
"Now I just want to take these
as example and ask, well,",00:02:48.630,00:02:52.900
"what's a basis
for that subspace?",00:02:52.900,00:02:55.240
"What's the dimension
of that subspace?",00:02:55.240,00:02:57.570
"And what's bd- dimension
of the whole space?",00:02:57.570,00:03:00.900
"So, there's a natural basis for
all three by three matrices,",00:03:00.900,00:03:07.840
"and why don't we
just write it down.",00:03:07.840,00:03:11.120
"So, so M, a basis for M.",00:03:11.120,00:03:21.370
"Again, all three by threes.",00:03:21.370,00:03:23.760
OK.,00:03:27.940,00:03:30.380
"And then I'll just count how
many members are in that basis",00:03:30.380,00:03:34.400
and I'll know the dimension.,00:03:34.400,00:03:36.490
"And OK, it's going to
take me a little time.",00:03:36.490,00:03:40.790
"In fact, what is the dimension?",00:03:40.790,00:03:43.720
"Any idea of what I'm
coming up with next?",00:03:43.720,00:03:47.840
"How many numbers does it
take to specify that three",00:03:47.840,00:03:52.570
by three matrix?,00:03:52.570,00:03:53.250
Nine.,00:03:53.250,00:03:53.750
"Nine is the, is the
dimension I'm going to find.",00:03:56.310,00:03:59.550
"And the most obvious basis
would be the matrix that's",00:03:59.550,00:04:04.630
"that matrix and then this
matrix with a one there",00:04:04.630,00:04:12.880
"and that's two of them,
shall I put in the third one,",00:04:12.880,00:04:21.490
"and then onwards, and
the last one maybe",00:04:21.490,00:04:27.130
would end with the one.,00:04:27.130,00:04:29.900
OK.,00:04:29.900,00:04:30.400
That's like the standard basis.,00:04:34.340,00:04:36.240
"In fact, our space is
practically the same",00:04:36.240,00:04:40.820
as nine dimensional space.,00:04:40.820,00:04:43.850
"It's just the nine numbers
are written in a square",00:04:43.850,00:04:48.310
instead of in a column.,00:04:48.310,00:04:50.150
"But somehow it's different
and, and ought to be thought",00:04:50.150,00:04:54.510
of as --,00:04:54.510,00:04:56.186
natural for itself.,00:04:59.310,00:05:01.280
"Because now what about the
symmetric three by threes?",00:05:01.280,00:05:05.760
So that's a subspace.,00:05:05.760,00:05:09.100
"Just let's just think, what's
the dimension of that subspace",00:05:09.100,00:05:12.300
"and what's a basis
for that subspace.",00:05:12.300,00:05:14.050
OK.,00:05:16.630,00:05:17.820
"And I guess this
question occurs to me.",00:05:17.820,00:05:21.300
"If I look at this subspace
of symmetric three",00:05:21.300,00:05:24.830
"by threes, well, how many
of these original basis",00:05:24.830,00:05:32.040
members belong to the subspace?,00:05:32.040,00:05:36.060
I think only three of them do.,00:05:36.060,00:05:38.050
This one is symmetric.,00:05:38.050,00:05:40.660
This last one is symmetric.,00:05:40.660,00:05:43.490
"And the one in the middle with
a, with a one in that position",00:05:43.490,00:05:48.250
"-- in the two two position,
would be symmetric.",00:05:48.250,00:05:52.210
"But so I've got three of these
original nine are symmetric,",00:05:52.210,00:05:56.680
"but, so this is an
example where --",00:05:56.680,00:06:03.800
"but that's, that's
not all, right?",00:06:03.800,00:06:05.600
What's the dimension?,00:06:05.600,00:06:06.610
Let's put the dimensions down.,00:06:06.610,00:06:08.450
"Dimension of the,
of M, was nine.",00:06:08.450,00:06:13.580
"What's the dimension of --
shall we call this S -- is what?",00:06:13.580,00:06:16.830
What's the dimension of this?,00:06:19.630,00:06:21.340
"I'm sort of taking simple
examples where we can, we can,",00:06:21.340,00:06:25.660
"spot the answer to
these questions.",00:06:25.660,00:06:30.130
"So how many -- if I
have a symmetric --",00:06:30.130,00:06:32.690
"think of all symmetric
matrices as a subspace,",00:06:32.690,00:06:36.750
"how many parameters do I choose
in three by three symmetric",00:06:36.750,00:06:40.760
matrices?,00:06:40.760,00:06:42.720
"Six, right.",00:06:42.720,00:06:45.020
"If I choose the
diagonal that's three,",00:06:45.020,00:06:49.220
"and the three entries
above the diagonal,",00:06:49.220,00:06:53.340
"then I know what the
three entries below.",00:06:53.340,00:06:55.230
So the dimension is six.,00:06:55.230,00:06:58.550
"I guess what's the
dimension of this here?",00:06:58.550,00:07:00.820
"Let's call this space
U for upper triangular.",00:07:00.820,00:07:05.180
"So what's the dimension of that
space of all upper triangular",00:07:05.180,00:07:09.440
three by threes?,00:07:09.440,00:07:11.390
Again six.,00:07:11.390,00:07:13.870
Again six.,00:07:13.870,00:07:14.585
"And, but we haven't got a -- we
haven't seen -- well, actually,",00:07:17.620,00:07:24.490
"maybe we have got a basis here
for, the upper triangulars.",00:07:24.490,00:07:29.620
"I guess six of these guys,
one, two, three, four,",00:07:29.620,00:07:35.070
"and a, and a couple more,
would be upper triangular.",00:07:35.070,00:07:39.120
"So there's a accidental case
where the big basis contains",00:07:39.120,00:07:44.390
in it a basis for the subspace.,00:07:44.390,00:07:46.930
"But with the symmetric
guy, it didn't have.",00:07:46.930,00:07:50.720
"The symmetric guy the,
basis -- so you see --",00:07:50.720,00:07:53.570
"a basis is the basis
for the big space,",00:07:53.570,00:07:56.690
"we generally need to think it
all over again to get a basis",00:07:56.690,00:08:00.800
for the subspace.,00:08:00.800,00:08:03.020
"And then how do I
get other subspaces?",00:08:03.020,00:08:06.050
"Well, we spoke before about, the
subspace the symmetric matrices",00:08:06.050,00:08:15.100
and the upper triangular.,00:08:15.100,00:08:18.050
"This is symmetric
and upper triangular.",00:08:18.050,00:08:24.920
"What's the, what's the
dimension of that space?",00:08:30.280,00:08:36.409
OK.,00:08:36.409,00:08:36.909
"Well, what's in that space?",00:08:36.909,00:08:39.390
"So what's -- if a matrix
is symmetric and also upper",00:08:39.390,00:08:42.480
"triangular, that
makes it diagonal.",00:08:42.480,00:08:46.950
"So this is the same as
the diagonal matrices,",00:08:46.950,00:08:51.640
diagonal three by threes.,00:08:51.640,00:08:55.230
"And the dimension of this,
of S intersect U, right --",00:08:55.230,00:09:03.260
you're OK with that symbol?,00:09:03.260,00:09:06.090
"That's, that's the vectors
that are in both S and U,",00:09:06.090,00:09:10.040
and that's D.,00:09:10.040,00:09:12.010
"So S intersect U
is the diagonals.",00:09:12.010,00:09:15.320
"And the dimension of the
diagonal matrices is three.",00:09:15.320,00:09:21.250
"And we've got a
basis, no problem.",00:09:21.250,00:09:24.880
"OK, as I write that, I think,
OK, what about putting --",00:09:24.880,00:09:33.430
"so this is like,
this intersection --",00:09:33.430,00:09:36.460
"is taking all the
vectors that are",00:09:36.460,00:09:40.820
"in both, that are symmetric
and also upper triangular.",00:09:40.820,00:09:45.720
Now we looked at the union.,00:09:45.720,00:09:50.620
"Suppose I take the
matrices that are symmetric",00:09:50.620,00:09:55.070
or upper triangular.,00:09:55.070,00:09:59.070
What -- why was that no good?,00:09:59.070,00:10:01.620
"So why is it no -- why I
not interested in the union,",00:10:01.620,00:10:08.900
"putting together
those two subspaces?",00:10:08.900,00:10:13.060
"So this, these are matrices that
are in S or in U, or possibly",00:10:13.060,00:10:18.740
"both, so they, the
diagonals included.",00:10:18.740,00:10:21.760
But what's bad about this?,00:10:21.760,00:10:22.970
It's not a subspace.,00:10:22.970,00:10:27.670
"It's like having,
taking, you know,",00:10:27.670,00:10:30.420
"a couple of lines in the
plane and stopping there.",00:10:30.420,00:10:34.145
"A line -- this is -- so there's
a three dimensional subspace",00:10:36.680,00:10:40.550
"of a nine dimensional space,
there's -- ooh, sorry, six.",00:10:40.550,00:10:44.030
"There's a six
dimensional subspace",00:10:44.030,00:10:46.150
of a nine dimensional space.,00:10:46.150,00:10:47.910
There's another one.,00:10:47.910,00:10:49.410
"But they, they're headed
in different directions,",00:10:49.410,00:10:52.670
"so we, we can't just
put them together.",00:10:52.670,00:10:55.360
We have to fill in.,00:10:55.360,00:10:56.990
So that's what we do.,00:10:56.990,00:10:58.870
"To get this bigger space that
I'll write with a plus sign,",00:10:58.870,00:11:03.000
"this is combinations of
things in S and things in U.",00:11:03.000,00:11:09.590
OK.,00:11:09.590,00:11:10.410
"So that's the final space
I'm going to introduce.",00:11:10.410,00:11:15.300
I have a couple of subspaces.,00:11:15.300,00:11:17.420
I can take their intersection.,00:11:17.420,00:11:19.830
"And now I'm interested in not
their union but their sum.",00:11:19.830,00:11:24.840
"So this would be the,
this is the intersection,",00:11:24.840,00:11:28.130
and this will be their sum.,00:11:28.130,00:11:31.580
"So what do I need
for a subspace here?",00:11:31.580,00:11:35.195
"I take anything in S
plus anything in U.",00:11:38.010,00:11:43.260
"I don't just take things
that are in S and pop",00:11:43.260,00:11:46.010
"in also, separately,
things that are in U.",00:11:46.010,00:11:48.600
"This is the sum of
any element of S,",00:11:48.600,00:11:56.190
"that is, any symmetric
matrix, plus any",00:11:56.190,00:12:02.310
"in U, any element of U.",00:12:02.310,00:12:08.450
OK.,00:12:08.450,00:12:09.050
"Now as long as we've
got an example here,",00:12:09.050,00:12:11.950
tell me what we get.,00:12:11.950,00:12:15.020
"If I take every
symmetric matrix,",00:12:15.020,00:12:18.270
"take all symmetric
matrices, and add them",00:12:18.270,00:12:20.310
"to all upper
triangular matrices,",00:12:20.310,00:12:22.770
"then I've got a whole lot of
matrices and it is a subspace.",00:12:22.770,00:12:27.520
"And what's -- it's
a vector space,",00:12:27.520,00:12:30.170
"and what vector space
would I then have?",00:12:30.170,00:12:34.280
"Any idea what,
what matrices can I",00:12:34.280,00:12:36.670
"get out of a symmetric
plus an upper triangular?",00:12:36.670,00:12:42.200
I can get anything.,00:12:42.200,00:12:44.200
I get all matrices.,00:12:44.200,00:12:45.600
I get all three by threes.,00:12:45.600,00:12:50.300
It's worth thinking about that.,00:12:50.300,00:12:54.380
"It's just like stretch your
mind a little, just a little,",00:12:54.380,00:12:58.330
"to, to think of these subspaces
and what their intersection is",00:12:58.330,00:13:05.700
and what their sum is.,00:13:05.700,00:13:07.110
"And now can I give you
a little -- oh, well,",00:13:07.110,00:13:08.950
let's figure out the dimension.,00:13:08.950,00:13:10.810
"So what's the
dimension of S plus U?",00:13:10.810,00:13:17.220
"In this example is nine, because
we got all three by threes.",00:13:17.220,00:13:25.470
"So the original spaces had, the
original symmetric space had",00:13:25.470,00:13:31.690
"dimension six and the original
upper triangular space",00:13:31.690,00:13:36.010
had dimension six.,00:13:36.010,00:13:38.010
"And actually I'm seeing
here a nice formula.",00:13:38.010,00:13:42.975
"That the dimension of S
plus the dimension of U --",00:13:48.360,00:13:54.810
"if I have two subspaces,
the dimension of one plus",00:13:54.810,00:13:58.020
"the dimension of the other

"of their intersection plus
the dimension of their sum.",00:14:03.750,00:14:07.850
Six plus six is three plus nine.,00:14:07.850,00:14:12.530
"That's kind of satisfying, that
these natural operations --",00:14:16.550,00:14:20.850

is it, actually,",00:14:20.850,00:14:23.360
"this is the set of
natural things to do with,",00:14:23.360,00:14:27.650
with subspaces.,00:14:27.650,00:14:29.390
"That, the dimensions
come out in a good way.",00:14:29.390,00:14:36.730
OK.,00:14:36.730,00:14:37.640
"Maybe I'll take just one more
example of a vector space",00:14:37.640,00:14:43.540

differential equations.",00:14:48.270,00:14:51.296

"that we'll give just
a few minutes to.",00:14:57.120,00:14:59.580
"Suppose I have a differential
equation like d^2y/dx^2+ y=0.",00:14:59.580,00:15:06.380
OK.,00:15:09.590,00:15:12.200
"I look at the solutions
to that equation.",00:15:12.200,00:15:14.175
"So what are the solutions
to that equation?",00:15:16.790,00:15:21.230
y=cos(x) is a solution.,00:15:21.230,00:15:24.815
y=sin(x) is a solution.,00:15:28.250,00:15:31.960
"y equals -- well, e to the (ix)
is a solution, if you want,",00:15:31.960,00:15:37.730
if you allow me to put that in.,00:15:37.730,00:15:41.150
But why should I put that in?,00:15:41.150,00:15:42.520
It's already there.,00:15:42.520,00:15:45.890
"You see, I'm really looking
at a null space here.",00:15:45.890,00:15:48.650
"I'm looking at the null space
of a differential equation.",00:15:48.650,00:15:52.730
That's the solution space.,00:15:52.730,00:15:55.210
"And describe the solution
space, all solutions",00:15:55.210,00:16:01.000
to this differential equation.,00:16:01.000,00:16:03.290
So the equation is y''+y=0.,00:16:03.290,00:16:07.450
"Cosine's, cosine's a
solution, sine is a solution.",00:16:07.450,00:16:11.630
Now tell me all the solutions.,00:16:11.630,00:16:14.430
"They're -- so I
don't need e^(ix).",00:16:14.430,00:16:18.930
Forget that.,00:16:18.930,00:16:21.220
"What are all the
complete solutions?",00:16:21.220,00:16:23.420
Is what?,00:16:30.510,00:16:32.860
A combination of these.,00:16:32.860,00:16:34.840
"The complete
solution is y equals",00:16:34.840,00:16:38.070
"some multiple of the cosine
plus some multiple of the sine.",00:16:38.070,00:16:48.350
That's a vector space.,00:16:48.350,00:16:51.520
That's a vector space.,00:16:51.520,00:16:52.660
"What's the dimension
of that space?",00:16:52.660,00:16:54.530
What's a basis for that space?,00:16:54.530,00:16:57.500
"OK, let me ask
you a basis first.",00:16:57.500,00:17:00.100
"If I take the set of
solutions to that second order",00:17:00.100,00:17:03.850

"there it is, those
are the solutions.",00:17:06.450,00:17:10.520
What's a basis for that space?,00:17:10.520,00:17:12.010
"Now remember, what's
the, what question I",00:17:14.680,00:17:16.480
asking?,00:17:16.480,00:17:16.980
"Because if you know the
question I'm asking,",00:17:16.980,00:17:18.890
you'll see the answer.,00:17:18.890,00:17:21.750
"A basis means all
the guys in the space",00:17:21.750,00:17:25.990
"are combinations of
these basis vectors.",00:17:25.990,00:17:29.170
"Well, this is a basis.",00:17:29.170,00:17:31.320
"sin x, cos x there is a basis.",00:17:31.320,00:17:35.870
"Those two -- they're like
the special solutions, right?",00:17:38.640,00:17:44.090
"We had special
solutions to Ax=b.",00:17:44.090,00:17:47.320
"Now we've got special solutions
to differential equations.",00:17:47.320,00:17:53.730
"Sorry, we had special
solutions to Ax=0, I misspoke.",00:17:53.730,00:17:59.270
"The special solutions
were for the null space",00:17:59.270,00:18:01.760
"just as here we're talking
about the null space.",00:18:01.760,00:18:04.040
"Do you see that here
is a -- those two --",00:18:04.040,00:18:07.360
"and what's the dimension
of the solution space?",00:18:07.360,00:18:13.170
How many vectors in this basis?,00:18:13.170,00:18:23.360
"Two, the sine and cosine.",00:18:23.360,00:18:27.430
"Are those the only
basis for this space?",00:18:27.430,00:18:30.960
By no means.,00:18:30.960,00:18:32.720
"e^(ix) and e^(-ix)
would be another basis.",00:18:32.720,00:18:37.070
Lots of bases.,00:18:37.070,00:18:38.220
"But do you see that really what
a course in differential --",00:18:38.220,00:18:43.960
"in linear differential equations
is about is finding a basis",00:18:43.960,00:18:50.720
for the solution space.,00:18:50.720,00:18:52.460
"The dimension of the solution
space will always be --",00:18:52.460,00:18:56.640
"will be two, because we have
a second order equation.",00:18:56.640,00:19:01.410
"So that's, like
there's 18.03 in --",00:19:01.410,00:19:04.470
"five minutes of 18.06 is enough
to, to take care of 18.03.",00:19:04.470,00:19:10.310
"So there's a -- that's
one more example.",00:19:10.310,00:19:12.590
OK.,00:19:12.590,00:19:13.090
"And of course the
point of the example",00:19:13.090,00:19:16.200
"is these things don't
look like vectors.",00:19:16.200,00:19:24.020
They look like functions.,00:19:24.020,00:19:26.080
"But we can call them vectors,
because we can add them",00:19:26.080,00:19:31.520
"and we can multiply
by constants,",00:19:31.520,00:19:34.320
"so we can take
linear combinations.",00:19:34.320,00:19:36.470
"That's all we have
to be allowed to do.",00:19:36.470,00:19:39.800
"So that's really why this idea
of linear algebra and basis",00:19:39.800,00:19:43.920
"and dimension and so on
plays a wider role than --",00:19:43.920,00:19:51.120
"our constant discussions
of m by n matrices.",00:19:51.120,00:19:56.820
OK.,00:19:56.820,00:19:57.520
"That's what I wanted to
say about that topic.",00:19:57.520,00:20:00.360
"Now of course the key, number
associated with matrices,",00:20:00.360,00:20:09.740
"to go back to that
number, is the rank.",00:20:09.740,00:20:13.510
"And the rank, what do
we know about the rank?",00:20:13.510,00:20:17.990
"Well, we know it's
not bigger than m",00:20:20.970,00:20:23.360
and it's not bigger than n.,00:20:23.360,00:20:25.310
"So but I'd like to have a
little discussion on the rank.",00:20:25.310,00:20:29.060
Maybe I'll put that here.,00:20:29.060,00:20:30.780
"So I'm picking up this
topic of rank one matrices.",00:20:30.780,00:20:33.895
"And the reason I'm interested
in rank one matrices",00:20:38.360,00:20:46.070
is that they ought to be simple.,00:20:46.070,00:20:48.900
"If the rank is only one, the
matrix can't get away from",00:20:48.900,00:20:55.450
us.,00:20:55.450,00:20:55.950
"So for example, let me take
-- let me create a rank one",00:20:55.950,00:20:59.840
matrix.,00:20:59.840,00:21:00.960
OK.,00:21:00.960,00:21:01.460
"Suppose it's three --
suppose it's two by three.",00:21:01.460,00:21:04.840
"And let me give
you the first row.",00:21:07.820,00:21:10.943
What can the second row be?,00:21:16.080,00:21:19.750
"Tell me a possible second row
here, for, for this matrix",00:21:19.750,00:21:24.060
to have rank one.,00:21:24.060,00:21:27.570
A possible second row is?,00:21:27.570,00:21:30.380
Two eight ten.,00:21:30.380,00:21:33.150
"The second row is a
multiple of the first row.",00:21:33.150,00:21:41.390
It's not independent.,00:21:41.390,00:21:43.380
"So tell me a basis
for the -- oh yeah,",00:21:43.380,00:21:45.580
"sorry to keep bringing
up these same questions.",00:21:45.580,00:21:50.250
"After the quiz I'll
stop, but for now,",00:21:50.250,00:21:53.750
"tell me a basis
for the row space.",00:21:53.750,00:21:57.200
"A basis for the row space of
that matrix is the first row,",00:21:57.200,00:22:03.470
right?,00:22:03.470,00:22:03.980
"The first row, one four five.",00:22:03.980,00:22:06.860
"A basis for the column
space of this matrix is?",00:22:06.860,00:22:11.020
"What's the dimension
of the column space?",00:22:11.020,00:22:15.110
"The dimension of the
column space is also one,",00:22:15.110,00:22:19.140
right?,00:22:19.140,00:22:19.640
Because it's also the rank.,00:22:19.640,00:22:21.130
"The dimension -- you remember
the dimension of the column",00:22:21.130,00:22:24.980
"space equals the rank equals the
dimension of the column space",00:22:24.980,00:22:33.090
"of the transpose, which
is the row space of A.",00:22:33.090,00:22:38.510
"OK, and in this case
it's one, r is one.",00:22:38.510,00:22:44.620
"And sure enough, all
the columns are --",00:22:44.620,00:22:48.080
"all the other columns are
multiples of that column.",00:22:48.080,00:22:51.390
"Now there's -- there ought
to be a nice way to see that,",00:22:51.390,00:22:57.000
and here it is.,00:22:57.000,00:22:59.700
"I can write that matrix as
its pivot column, one two,",00:22:59.700,00:23:06.530
times its --,00:23:06.530,00:23:10.520
times one four five.,00:23:10.520,00:23:11.730
"A column times a row,
one column times one row",00:23:14.470,00:23:18.570
"gives me a matrix, right?",00:23:18.570,00:23:21.340
"If I multiply a
column by a row, that,",00:23:21.340,00:23:25.370
"g- that's a two by one matrix
times a one by three matrix,",00:23:25.370,00:23:30.500
"and the result of the
multiplication is two by three.",00:23:30.500,00:23:34.780
And it comes out right.,00:23:34.780,00:23:36.630
"So what I want to -- my point
is the rank one matrices that",00:23:36.630,00:23:45.450
"every rank one matrix has the
form some column times some",00:23:45.450,00:23:52.830
row.,00:23:52.830,00:23:55.520
"So U is a column vector,
V is a column vector --",00:23:55.520,00:23:59.180
"but I make it into a row
by putting in V transpose.",00:23:59.180,00:24:03.570
"So that's the -- complete
picture of rank one matrices.",00:24:03.570,00:24:12.330
"We'll be interested
in rank one matrices.",00:24:12.330,00:24:14.580
"Later we'll find, oh, their
determinant, that'll be easy,",00:24:14.580,00:24:19.270
"their eigenvalues,
that'll be interesting.",00:24:19.270,00:24:23.620
"Rank one matrices are
like the building blocks",00:24:23.620,00:24:26.450
for all matrices.,00:24:26.450,00:24:27.410
"And actually maybe
you can guess.",00:24:27.410,00:24:30.620
"If I took any matrix, a five by
seventeen matrix of rank four,",00:24:37.220,00:24:47.890
"then it seems pretty
likely -- and it's true,",00:24:47.890,00:24:51.890
"that I could break that five
by seventeen matrix down",00:24:51.890,00:24:56.060
"as a combination of
rank one matrices.",00:24:56.060,00:24:59.840
"And probably how many
of those would I need?",00:24:59.840,00:25:03.310
"If I have a five by seventeen
matrix of rank four,",00:25:03.310,00:25:07.810
"I'll need four of them, right.",00:25:07.810,00:25:11.300
Four rank one matrices.,00:25:11.300,00:25:13.490
"So the rank one matrices are
the, are the building blocks.",00:25:13.490,00:25:17.710
"And out -- I can produce every,
I can produce every five by --",00:25:17.710,00:25:23.680
"every rank four matrix out
of four rank one matrices.",00:25:23.680,00:25:29.070
"That brings me to a
question, of course.",00:25:29.070,00:25:33.170
OK.,00:25:33.170,00:25:33.670
"Would the rank four
matrices form a subspace?",00:25:33.670,00:25:36.406
"Let me take all five by
seventeen matrices and think",00:25:38.990,00:25:43.450
"about rank four -- the
subset of rank four matrices.",00:25:43.450,00:25:48.589
Let me -- I'll write this down.,00:25:48.589,00:25:49.880
"You seem I'm reviewing
for the quiz,",00:25:53.670,00:25:57.010
"because I'm asking the kind of
questions that are short enough",00:25:57.010,00:26:00.800
"but -- that bring out do you
know what these words mean.",00:26:00.800,00:26:04.780
So I take --,00:26:04.780,00:26:06.400
"my matrix space M now is all
five by seventeen matrices.",00:26:06.400,00:26:13.080
"And now the question I ask is
the subset of, of rank four",00:26:13.080,00:26:27.010
"matrices, is that a subspace?",00:26:27.010,00:26:34.340
"If I add a matrix of -- so if I
multiply a matrix of rank four",00:26:34.340,00:26:38.650
by --,00:26:38.650,00:26:39.880
"of rank four or less,
let's say, because I",00:26:39.880,00:26:43.520
"have to let the zero matrix in
if it's going to be a subspace.",00:26:43.520,00:26:49.490
"But, but that doesn't just
because the zero matrix",00:26:49.490,00:26:52.330
"got in there doesn't
mean I have a subspace.",00:26:52.330,00:26:56.610
"So if I -- so the, the question
really comes down to --",00:26:56.610,00:26:59.840
"if I add two rank four
matrices, is the sum rank four?",00:26:59.840,00:27:05.605
What do you think?,00:27:09.050,00:27:09.800
"If -- no, not usually.",00:27:12.730,00:27:15.110
Not usually.,00:27:15.110,00:27:16.540
"If I add two rank four
matrices, the sum is probably --",00:27:16.540,00:27:20.200
what could I say about the sum?,00:27:20.200,00:27:22.750
"Well, actually, well,
the rank could be five.",00:27:22.750,00:27:27.905
"It's a general fact, actually,
that the rank of A plus B",00:27:30.790,00:27:35.610
"can't be more than rank
of A plus the rank of B.",00:27:35.610,00:27:40.880
"So this would say if
I added two of those,",00:27:40.880,00:27:42.880
"the rank couldn't be larger
than eight, but I know actually",00:27:42.880,00:27:45.820
"the rank couldn't be as
large as eight anyway.",00:27:45.820,00:27:48.420
"What -- how big
could the rank be,",00:27:48.420,00:27:50.650
"for, for the rank
of a matrix in M?",00:27:50.650,00:27:52.480
"Could be as large as
five, right, right.",00:27:52.480,00:27:57.450
"So they're all sort
of natural ideas.",00:27:57.450,00:28:00.460
"So it's rank four matrices
or rank one matrices --",00:28:00.460,00:28:05.570
"let me, let me change
that to rank one.",00:28:05.570,00:28:09.600
"Let me take the subset
of rank one matrices.",00:28:09.600,00:28:12.670

"It's most likely going
to have rank two.",00:28:20.460,00:28:23.050
So this is --,00:28:23.050,00:28:23.790
So I'll just make that point.,00:28:23.790,00:28:25.090
Not a subspace.,00:28:25.090,00:28:27.690
OK.,00:28:32.030,00:28:34.640
OK.,00:28:34.640,00:28:35.140
"Those are topics that
I wanted to, just",00:28:35.140,00:28:38.210
"fill out the, the
previous lectures.",00:28:38.210,00:28:42.530
"The I'll ask one more
subspace question, a,",00:28:42.530,00:28:46.730
"a more, a more, likely example.",00:28:46.730,00:28:50.570
"Suppose I'm in -- let me put,
put this example on a new",00:28:50.570,00:28:53.751
board.,00:28:53.751,00:28:54.250
"Suppose I'm in R, in R^4.",00:28:56.850,00:28:58.823
"So my typical vector in R^4 has
four components, v1, v2, v3,",00:29:03.980,00:29:10.850
and v4.,00:29:10.850,00:29:11.350
"Suppose I take the
subspace of vectors",00:29:15.560,00:29:21.280
whose components add to zero.,00:29:21.280,00:29:23.850
"So I let S be all v, all vectors
v in four dimensional space",00:29:23.850,00:29:34.070
with v1+v2+v3+v4=0.,00:29:34.070,00:29:37.050
"So I just want to consider
that bunch of vectors.",00:29:37.050,00:29:39.320
"Is it a subspace, first of all?",00:29:39.320,00:29:41.560
It is a subspace.,00:29:41.560,00:29:42.430
It is a subspace.,00:29:42.430,00:29:57.880
What's -- how do we see that?,00:29:57.880,00:30:01.780
It is a subspace.,00:30:01.780,00:30:04.380
I -- formally I should check.,00:30:04.380,00:30:06.890
"If I have one vector that with
whose components add to zero",00:30:06.890,00:30:11.430
"and I multiply that
vector by six --",00:30:11.430,00:30:13.990
"the components still add to
zero, just six times as --",00:30:13.990,00:30:16.980
six times zero.,00:30:16.980,00:30:19.250
"If I have a couple of v
and a w and I add them,",00:30:19.250,00:30:22.840
"the, the components
still add to zero.",00:30:22.840,00:30:25.150
"OK, it's a subspace.",00:30:25.150,00:30:27.170
"What's the dimension
of that space",00:30:27.170,00:30:29.500
"and what's a basis
for that space?",00:30:29.500,00:30:32.730
"So you see how I can just
describe a space and we --",00:30:32.730,00:30:37.370
"we can ask for the dimension
-- ask for the basis first",00:30:37.370,00:30:41.530
and the dimension.,00:30:41.530,00:30:42.800
"Of course, the
dimension's the one",00:30:42.800,00:30:44.620
"that's easy to tell
me in a single word.",00:30:44.620,00:30:48.710
"What's the dimension
of our subspace S here?",00:30:48.710,00:30:51.790
And a basis tell me --,00:30:55.910,00:30:57.940
some vectors in it.,00:30:57.940,00:31:01.250
"Well, I'm going to make ask you
again to guess the dimension.",00:31:01.250,00:31:07.210
Again I think I heard it.,00:31:07.210,00:31:09.190
The dimension is three.,00:31:09.190,00:31:11.270
Three.,00:31:11.270,00:31:12.650
"Now how does this
connect to our Ax=0?",00:31:12.650,00:31:18.380
"Is this the null
space of something?",00:31:18.380,00:31:21.370
"Is that the null
space of a matrix?",00:31:21.370,00:31:24.500
"And then we can
look at the matrix",00:31:24.500,00:31:26.210
"and, and we know everything
about those subspaces.",00:31:26.210,00:31:30.240
"This is the null
space of what matrix?",00:31:30.240,00:31:39.665
"What's the matrix where the
null space is then Ab=0.",00:31:47.010,00:31:53.030
"So I want this
equation to be Ab=0.",00:31:53.030,00:31:57.195
b is now the vector.,00:31:59.920,00:32:02.510
"And what's the matrix that,
that we're seeing there?",00:32:02.510,00:32:07.850
It's the matrix of four ones.,00:32:07.850,00:32:14.580
"Do you see that that's -- that
if I look at Ab=0 for this",00:32:14.580,00:32:20.120
"matrix A, I multiply by b
and I get this requirement,",00:32:20.120,00:32:27.180
that the components add to zero.,00:32:27.180,00:32:29.280
"So I'm really when
I speak about S --",00:32:29.280,00:32:33.670
"I'm speaking about the
null space of that matrix.",00:32:33.670,00:32:37.280
OK.,00:32:37.280,00:32:38.050
"Let's just say we've
got a matrix now,",00:32:38.050,00:32:41.350
we want its null space.,00:32:41.350,00:32:44.000
"Well, we -- tell
me its rank first.",00:32:44.000,00:32:47.610
"The rank of that
matrix is one, thanks.",00:32:47.610,00:32:54.900
So r is one.,00:32:54.900,00:32:57.210
"What's the general
formula for the dimension",00:32:57.210,00:32:59.610
of the null space?,00:32:59.610,00:33:01.530
"The dimension of the null
space of a matrix is --",00:33:01.530,00:33:07.640
"in general, an m by
n matrix of rank r?",00:33:07.640,00:33:12.420
"How many independent
guys in the null space?",00:33:12.420,00:33:16.895
"n-r, right?",00:33:21.140,00:33:22.920
n-r.,00:33:22.920,00:33:25.780
"In this case, n is
four, four columns.",00:33:25.780,00:33:31.390
"The rank is one, so the null
space is three dimensions.",00:33:31.390,00:33:35.330
"So of course y- you could
see it in this case,",00:33:35.330,00:33:39.440
"but you can also see it
here in our systematic way",00:33:39.440,00:33:44.160
"of dealing with the four
fundamental subspaces",00:33:44.160,00:33:49.450
of a matrix.,00:33:49.450,00:33:51.730
"So what actually what,
what are all four subspaces",00:33:51.730,00:33:55.410
then?,00:33:55.410,00:33:56.050
The row space is clear.,00:33:56.050,00:33:58.840
The row space is in R^4.,00:33:58.840,00:34:01.420
"Yeah, can we take the
four fundamental subspaces",00:34:01.420,00:34:05.530
of this matrix?,00:34:05.530,00:34:06.910
Let's just kill this example.,00:34:06.910,00:34:08.815
"The row space is
one dimensional.",00:34:11.860,00:34:15.400
"It's all multiples
of that, of that row.",00:34:15.400,00:34:19.830
"The null space is
three dimensional.",00:34:19.830,00:34:22.780
"Oh, you better give me a
basis for the null space.",00:34:22.780,00:34:26.260
"So what's a basis
for the null space?",00:34:26.260,00:34:28.080
The special solutions.,00:34:28.080,00:34:30.489
"To find the special solutions,
I look for the free variables.",00:34:30.489,00:34:34.830
"The free variables here
are -- there's the pivot.",00:34:34.830,00:34:39.650
"The free variables are
two, three, and four.",00:34:39.650,00:34:44.010
"So the basis, basis
for S, for S will be --",00:34:44.010,00:34:52.730
"I'm expecting three vectors,
three special solutions.",00:34:52.730,00:35:01.710
"I give the value one
to that free variable,",00:35:01.710,00:35:06.470
"and what's the pivot
variable if the --",00:35:06.470,00:35:12.000
"this is going to
be a vector in S?",00:35:12.000,00:35:15.130
Minus one.,00:35:15.130,00:35:16.390
"Now they're always added to
-- the entries add to zero.",00:35:16.390,00:35:20.250
"The second special
solution has a one",00:35:20.250,00:35:22.870
"in the second free variable,
and again a minus one",00:35:22.870,00:35:26.540
makes it right.,00:35:26.540,00:35:27.730
"The third one has a one in
the third free variable,",00:35:27.730,00:35:30.940
"and again a minus
one makes it right.",00:35:30.940,00:35:34.910
That's my answer.,00:35:34.910,00:35:35.780
"That's the answer I
would be looking for.",00:35:35.780,00:35:39.770
"The -- a basis for
this subspace S,",00:35:39.770,00:35:43.300
"you would just
list three vectors,",00:35:43.300,00:35:45.530
"and those would be the
natural three to list.",00:35:45.530,00:35:48.350
"Not the only possible three,
but those are the special three.",00:35:48.350,00:35:55.240
"OK, tell me about
the column space,",00:35:55.240,00:35:58.960
"What's the column
space of this matrix A?",00:35:58.960,00:36:02.560
"So the column space
is a subspace of R^1,",00:36:07.390,00:36:13.500
because m is only one.,00:36:13.500,00:36:15.470
"The columns only
have one component.",00:36:15.470,00:36:17.920
"So the column space of S, the
column space of A is somewhere",00:36:17.920,00:36:23.360
"in the space R^1,
because we only have --",00:36:23.360,00:36:26.410
these columns are short.,00:36:26.410,00:36:30.240
"And what is the
column space actually?",00:36:30.240,00:36:32.940
"I just, it's just talking with
these words is what I'm doing.",00:36:36.330,00:36:42.280
"The column space for
that matrix is R^1.",00:36:42.280,00:36:48.360
"The column space
for that matrix is",00:36:48.360,00:36:52.780
all multiples of that column.,00:36:52.780,00:36:55.463
"And all multiples
give you all of R^1.",00:36:58.410,00:37:00.760
"And what's the, the
remaining fourth space,",00:37:03.630,00:37:07.140
"the null space of A
transpose is what?",00:37:07.140,00:37:12.680
So we transpose A.,00:37:17.560,00:37:21.880
"We look for combinations
of the columns",00:37:21.880,00:37:26.290
"now that give zero
for A transpose.",00:37:26.290,00:37:30.310
And there aren't any.,00:37:30.310,00:37:32.190
"The only thing, the only
combination of these rows",00:37:32.190,00:37:36.620
"to give the zero row is
the zero combination.",00:37:36.620,00:37:41.500
OK.,00:37:41.500,00:37:42.380
So let's just check dimensions.,00:37:42.380,00:37:44.415
"The null space has
dimension three.",00:37:47.180,00:37:51.320
The row space has dimension one.,00:37:51.320,00:37:53.420
Three plus one is four.,00:37:53.420,00:37:54.630
"The column space
has dimension one,",00:37:57.180,00:37:59.680
"and what's the
dimension of this, like,",00:37:59.680,00:38:02.790
smallest possible space?,00:38:02.790,00:38:05.510
"What's the dimension
of the zero space?",00:38:05.510,00:38:08.790
It's a subspace.,00:38:08.790,00:38:09.675
Zero.,00:38:13.520,00:38:14.190
What else could it be?,00:38:14.190,00:38:15.190
"I mean, let's -- we have to
take a reasonable answer --",00:38:15.190,00:38:17.970
"and the only reasonable
answer is zero.",00:38:17.970,00:38:20.190
"So one plus zero gives -- this
was n, the number of columns,",00:38:20.190,00:38:25.900
"and this is m, the
number of rows.",00:38:25.900,00:38:30.480
"And let's just, let
me just say again",00:38:30.480,00:38:32.910
"then the, the, the subspace
that has only that one",00:38:32.910,00:38:37.030
"point, that point is zero
dimensional, of course.",00:38:37.030,00:38:42.830
"And the basis is empty, because
if the dimension is zero,",00:38:42.830,00:38:46.920
"there shouldn't be
anybody in the basis.",00:38:46.920,00:38:49.480
"So the basis of that smallest
subspace is the empty set.",00:38:49.480,00:38:56.160
"And the number of members
in the empty set is zero,",00:38:56.160,00:38:59.590
so that's the dimension.,00:38:59.590,00:39:01.400
OK.,00:39:01.400,00:39:02.610
Good.,00:39:02.610,00:39:04.040
"Now I have just five
minutes to tell you about --",00:39:04.040,00:39:10.740
"well, actually, about some,
some, some, this is now,",00:39:10.740,00:39:16.010
"this last topic of small
world graphs, and leads into,",00:39:16.010,00:39:21.430
"a lecture about graphs
and linear algebra.",00:39:21.430,00:39:27.140
But let me tell you --,00:39:27.140,00:39:29.700
"in these last minutes the
graph that I interested in.",00:39:29.700,00:39:32.860
"It's the graph where
-- so what is a graph?",00:39:32.860,00:39:40.600
Better tell you that first.,00:39:40.600,00:39:42.020
OK.,00:39:42.020,00:39:42.880
What's a graph?,00:39:42.880,00:39:43.516
OK.,00:39:47.380,00:39:48.180
This isn't calculus.,00:39:48.180,00:39:49.980
"We're not, I'm not thinking
of, like, some sine curve.",00:39:49.980,00:39:54.010
"The word graph is used in
a completely different way.",00:39:54.010,00:39:57.940
"It's a set of, a bunch
of nodes and edges,",00:39:57.940,00:40:07.490
edges connecting the nodes.,00:40:07.490,00:40:10.060
"So I have nodes like
five nodes and edges --",00:40:10.060,00:40:17.280
"I'll put in some edges, I
could put, include them all.",00:40:17.280,00:40:21.880
"There's -- well, let me
put in a couple more.",00:40:21.880,00:40:23.970
"There's a graph with five
nodes and one two three four",00:40:27.350,00:40:31.380
five six edges.,00:40:31.380,00:40:34.690
"And some five by six
matrix is going to tell us",00:40:34.690,00:40:38.190
everything about that graph.,00:40:38.190,00:40:41.100
"Let me leave that
matrix to next time",00:40:41.100,00:40:43.350
"and tell you about the
question I'm interested in.",00:40:43.350,00:40:46.350
"Suppose, suppose the
graph isn't just,",00:40:46.350,00:40:52.340
"just doesn't have just five
nodes, but suppose every,",00:40:52.340,00:40:56.230
"suppose every person
in this room is a node.",00:40:56.230,00:40:59.780
"And suppose there's an
edge between two nodes",00:41:03.200,00:41:07.310
if those two people are friends.,00:41:07.310,00:41:11.300
So have I described a graph?,00:41:11.300,00:41:14.070
"It's a pretty big graph,
hundred, hundred nodes.",00:41:14.070,00:41:18.980
"And I don't know how
many edges are in there.",00:41:18.980,00:41:21.190
"There's an edge
if you're friends.",00:41:24.920,00:41:27.730
"So that's the graph
for this class.",00:41:27.730,00:41:29.950
"A, a similar graph you could
take for the whole country,",00:41:29.950,00:41:35.120
"so two hundred and
sixty million nodes.",00:41:35.120,00:41:38.680
And edges between friends.,00:41:38.680,00:41:43.340
"And the question for that graph
is how many steps does it take",00:41:43.340,00:41:50.110

"What two people are furthest
apart in this friendship graph,",00:41:56.780,00:42:01.950
say for the US?,00:42:01.950,00:42:04.070
"By furthest apart, I
mean the distance from --",00:42:04.070,00:42:08.820
"well, I'll tell you my
distance to Clinton.",00:42:08.820,00:42:12.640
It's two.,00:42:12.640,00:42:14.040
"I happened to go to college
with somebody who knows Clinton.",00:42:14.040,00:42:18.440
I don't know him.,00:42:18.440,00:42:19.190
"So my distance to Clinton is not
one, because I don't, happily",00:42:19.190,00:42:24.950
"or not, don't know him.",00:42:24.950,00:42:26.680
But I know somebody who does.,00:42:26.680,00:42:29.050
"He's a Senator and so
I presume he knows him.",00:42:29.050,00:42:32.541
OK.,00:42:32.541,00:42:33.040
"I don't know what your --
well, what's your distance",00:42:33.040,00:42:35.311
to Clinton?,00:42:35.311,00:42:35.810
"Well, not more
than three, right.",00:42:39.100,00:42:40.950
"Actually, true.",00:42:40.950,00:42:43.000
You know me.,00:42:43.000,00:42:44.430
"I take credit for reducing your
Clinton distance to three --",00:42:44.430,00:42:50.880
what's your distance to Monica.,00:42:50.880,00:42:52.195
"Not, anybody below -- below
four is in trouble here.",00:42:54.780,00:43:04.090
"Or maybe three, but, right.",00:43:04.090,00:43:07.010
"So -- and what's Hillary's
distance to Monica?",00:43:07.010,00:43:14.740
"I don't think we'd better
put that on tape here.",00:43:14.740,00:43:18.020
"That's one or two, I guess.",00:43:18.020,00:43:22.360
Is that right?,00:43:22.360,00:43:24.490
"I don't -- well, we won't,
think more about that.",00:43:24.490,00:43:28.980
"So actually, the,
the real question",00:43:28.980,00:43:32.490
is what are large distances?,00:43:32.490,00:43:38.030
"How, how far apart could
people be separated?",00:43:38.030,00:43:41.910
"And roughly this number
six degrees of separation",00:43:41.910,00:43:46.520
"has kind of appeared as the
movie title, as the book title,",00:43:46.520,00:43:49.940
and it's with this meaning.,00:43:49.940,00:43:52.050
That roughly speaking --,00:43:52.050,00:43:56.050
six might be a fairly --,00:43:56.050,00:43:59.230
not too many people.,00:43:59.230,00:44:01.860
"If you sit next to
somebody on an airplane,",00:44:01.860,00:44:04.860
you get talking to them.,00:44:04.860,00:44:07.850
"You begin to discuss mutual
friends to sort of find out,",00:44:07.850,00:44:12.310
"OK, what connections
do you have,",00:44:12.310,00:44:15.220
"and very often
you'll find you're",00:44:15.220,00:44:17.450
"connected in, like, two
or three or four steps.",00:44:17.450,00:44:21.880
"And you remark,
it's a small world,",00:44:21.880,00:44:23.970
"and that's how this expression
small world came up.",00:44:23.970,00:44:27.850
"But six, I don't know if you
could find -- if it took six,",00:44:27.850,00:44:31.450
"I don't know if you would
successfully discover those six",00:44:31.450,00:44:34.810
"in a, in an airplane
conversation.",00:44:34.810,00:44:36.980
"But here's the math
question, and I'll",00:44:36.980,00:44:40.150
"leave it for next,
for lecture twelve,",00:44:40.150,00:44:42.650
"and do a lot of linear
algebra in lecture twelve.",00:44:42.650,00:44:46.010
"But the interesting point is
that with a few shortcuts,",00:44:46.010,00:44:54.860
"the distances come
down dramatically.",00:44:54.860,00:44:58.290
"That, I mean, all your distances
to Clinton immediately drop",00:44:58.290,00:45:03.900
"to three by taking
linear algebra.",00:45:03.900,00:45:06.460
"That's, like, an extra bonus
for taking linear algebra.",00:45:06.460,00:45:11.580
"And to understand mathematically
what it is about these graphs",00:45:11.580,00:45:17.550
--,00:45:17.550,00:45:18.120
"or like the graphs of
the World Wide Web.",00:45:18.120,00:45:21.710
There's a fantastic graph.,00:45:21.710,00:45:23.170
"So many people would like to
understand and model the web.",00:45:23.170,00:45:27.790
"What the -- where the edges are
links and the nodes are, sites,",00:45:27.790,00:45:34.650
websites.,00:45:34.650,00:45:37.530
"I'll leave you with that
graph, and I'll see you --",00:45:37.530,00:45:39.960
"have a good weekend,
and see you on Monday.",00:45:39.960,00:45:42.740
