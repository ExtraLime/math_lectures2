"Probability models often
involve infinite sample",00:00:00.680,00:00:04.170
"spaces, that is,
infinite sets.",00:00:04.170,00:00:08.780
"But not all sets are
of the same kind.",00:00:08.780,00:00:12.570
"Some sets are discrete and we
call them countable, and some",00:00:12.570,00:00:17.530
"are continuous and we call
them uncountable.",00:00:17.530,00:00:20.960
"But what exactly is the
difference between these two",00:00:20.960,00:00:23.470
types of sets?,00:00:23.470,00:00:24.860
"How can we define
it precisely?",00:00:24.860,00:00:27.760
"Well, let us start by first
giving a definition of what it",00:00:27.760,00:00:31.320
means to have a countable set.,00:00:31.320,00:00:33.920
"A set will be called countable
if its elements can be put",00:00:33.920,00:00:37.530
"into a 1-to-1 correspondence
with the positive integers.",00:00:37.530,00:00:41.450
"This means that we look at the
elements of that set, and we",00:00:41.450,00:00:45.280
"take one element-- we call
it the first element.",00:00:45.280,00:00:47.990
"We take another element--
we call it the second.",00:00:47.990,00:00:50.790
"Another, we call the third
element, and so on.",00:00:50.790,00:00:54.090
"And this way we will eventually
exhaust all of the",00:00:54.090,00:00:58.980
"elements of the set, so that
each one of those elements",00:00:58.980,00:01:02.920
"corresponds to a particular
positive integer, namely the",00:01:02.920,00:01:06.840
index that appears underneath.,00:01:06.840,00:01:09.140
"More formally, what's happening
is that we take",00:01:09.140,00:01:13.110
"elements of that set that are
arranged in a sequence.",00:01:13.110,00:01:18.810
"We look at the set, which is the
entire range of values of",00:01:18.810,00:01:24.420
"that sequence, and we want that
sequence to exhaust the",00:01:24.420,00:01:28.580
entire set omega.,00:01:28.580,00:01:31.470
"Or in other words, in simpler
terms, we want to be able to",00:01:31.470,00:01:37.250
"arrange all of the elements
of omega in a sequence.",00:01:37.250,00:01:43.360
"So what are some examples
of countable sets?",00:01:43.360,00:01:46.800
"In a trivial sense, the positive
integers themselves",00:01:46.800,00:01:50.330
"are countable, because we can
arrange them in a sequence.",00:01:50.330,00:01:54.960
"This is almost tautological,
by the definition.",00:01:54.960,00:01:58.110
"For a more interesting example,
let's look at the set",00:01:58.110,00:02:00.820
of all integers.,00:02:00.820,00:02:02.370
"Can we arrange them
in a sequence?",00:02:02.370,00:02:04.610
"Yes, we can, and we can do it
in this manner, where we",00:02:04.610,00:02:09.669
"alternate between positive
and negative numbers.",00:02:09.669,00:02:13.330
"And this way, we're going to
cover all of the integers, and",00:02:13.330,00:02:16.880
"we have arranged them
in a sequence.",00:02:16.880,00:02:20.190
"How about the set of all pairs
of positive integers?",00:02:20.190,00:02:24.870
This is less clear.,00:02:24.870,00:02:27.280
Let us look at this picture.,00:02:27.280,00:02:28.480
"This is the set of all pairs of
positive integers, which we",00:02:28.480,00:02:32.560
"understand to continue
indefinitely.",00:02:32.560,00:02:35.590
"Can we arrange this sets
in a sequence?",00:02:35.590,00:02:39.450
It turns out that we can.,00:02:39.450,00:02:40.870
"And we can do it by tracing
a path of this kind.",00:02:40.870,00:02:45.310
"So you can probably get
the sense of how",00:02:50.130,00:02:52.990
this path is going.,00:02:52.990,00:02:54.820
"And by continuing this way, over
and over, we're going to",00:02:54.820,00:03:00.090
"cover the entire set of all
pairs of positive integers.",00:03:00.090,00:03:05.370
"So we have managed to arrange
them in a sequence.",00:03:05.370,00:03:07.840
"So the set of all such pairs
is indeed a countable set.",00:03:07.840,00:03:11.870
"And the same argument can be
extended to argue for the set",00:03:11.870,00:03:15.160
"of all triples of positive
integers, or the set of all",00:03:15.160,00:03:19.816
"quadruples of positive
integers, and so on.",00:03:19.816,00:03:23.350
"This is actually not just a
trivial mathematical point",00:03:23.350,00:03:28.550
"that we discuss for some curious
reason, but it is",00:03:28.550,00:03:32.270
"because we will often
have sample spaces",00:03:32.270,00:03:35.280
that are of this kind.,00:03:35.280,00:03:36.960
"And it's important to know
that they're countable.",00:03:36.960,00:03:41.490
Now for a more subtle example.,00:03:41.490,00:03:44.079
"Let us look at all rational
numbers within the range",00:03:44.079,00:03:48.070
between 0 and 1.,00:03:48.070,00:03:50.640
"What do we mean by
rational numbers?",00:03:50.640,00:03:53.140
"We mean those numbers that
can be expressed as a",00:03:53.140,00:03:56.340
ratio of two integers.,00:03:56.340,00:03:59.050
"It turns out that we can arrange
them in a sequence,",00:03:59.050,00:04:02.240
and we can do it as follows.,00:04:02.240,00:04:04.540
"Let us first look at rational
numbers that have a",00:04:04.540,00:04:07.050
denominator term of 2.,00:04:07.050,00:04:09.450
"Then, look at the rational
numbers that have a",00:04:09.450,00:04:12.120
denominator term of 3.,00:04:12.120,00:04:16.140
"Then, look at the rational
numbers, always within this",00:04:16.140,00:04:19.500
"range of interest, that have
a denominator of 4.",00:04:19.500,00:04:23.230
"And then we continue
similarly--",00:04:26.270,00:04:28.780
"rational numbers that have a
denominator of 5, and so on.",00:04:28.780,00:04:33.630
"This way, we're going
to exhaust all of",00:04:33.630,00:04:35.909
the rational numbers.,00:04:35.909,00:04:37.710
"Actually, this number here
already appeared there.",00:04:37.710,00:04:42.650
It's the same number.,00:04:42.650,00:04:44.030
"So we do not need to include
this in a sequence, but that's",00:04:44.030,00:04:47.720
not an issue.,00:04:47.720,00:04:49.020
"Whenever we see a rational
number that has already been",00:04:49.020,00:04:52.920
"encountered before,
we just delete it.",00:04:52.920,00:04:56.060
"In the end, we end up with a
sequence that goes over all of",00:04:56.060,00:05:00.480
the possible rational numbers.,00:05:00.480,00:05:02.090
"And so we conclude that the set
of all rational numbers is",00:05:02.090,00:05:05.310
itself a countable set.,00:05:05.310,00:05:07.500
"So what kind of set would
be uncountable?",00:05:07.500,00:05:11.350
"An uncountable set, by
definition, is a set that is",00:05:11.350,00:05:14.240
not countable.,00:05:14.240,00:05:15.570
"And there are examples of
uncountable sets, most",00:05:15.570,00:05:19.480
"prominent, continuous subsets
of the real line.",00:05:19.480,00:05:24.560
"Whenever we have an interval,
the unit interval, or any",00:05:24.560,00:05:28.110
"other interval that has positive
length, that interval",00:05:28.110,00:05:31.710
is an uncountable set.,00:05:31.710,00:05:34.290
"And the same is true if, instead
of an interval, we",00:05:34.290,00:05:37.370
"look at the entire real line,
or we look at the",00:05:37.370,00:05:40.490
"two-dimensional plane,
or three-dimensional",00:05:40.490,00:05:43.330
"space, and so on.",00:05:43.330,00:05:44.760
"So all the usual sets that we
think of as continuous sets",00:05:44.760,00:05:48.960
turn out to be uncountable.,00:05:48.960,00:05:52.040
"How do we know that they
are uncountable?",00:05:52.040,00:05:55.040
"There is actually a brilliant
argument that establishes that",00:05:55.040,00:05:58.640
"the unit interval
is uncountable.",00:05:58.640,00:06:01.650
"And then the argument is easily
extended to other",00:06:01.650,00:06:04.360
"cases, like the reals
and the plane.",00:06:04.360,00:06:07.150
"We do not need to know how this
argument goes, for the",00:06:07.150,00:06:10.240
purposes of this course.,00:06:10.240,00:06:11.820
"But just because it is so
beautiful, we will actually be",00:06:11.820,00:06:15.930
presenting it to you.,00:06:15.930,00:06:17.190
