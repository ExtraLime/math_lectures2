"PROFESSOR: It was written about
Route 66, which used to",00:00:08.982,00:00:12.180
"be the main highway between
Chicago, Illinois and Los",00:00:12.180,00:00:15.640
"Angeles, California.",00:00:15.640,00:00:17.610
"Very famous highway because
anybody who wanted to go",00:00:17.610,00:00:19.860
"across country always took route
66 because it was the",00:00:19.860,00:00:23.550
shortest way to go.,00:00:23.550,00:00:25.950
"And the question is, how do you
find the shortest path?",00:00:25.950,00:00:29.620
"Not just any old path or a good
path, but how do you find",00:00:29.620,00:00:34.760
the very shortest path?,00:00:34.760,00:00:36.230
"And that'll be the subject
that we're",00:00:36.230,00:00:37.764
going to discuss today.,00:00:37.764,00:00:38.660
"But route 66, I lament its
passing, but it's been largely",00:00:38.660,00:00:43.560
"replaced by the interstate
highway system that was",00:00:43.560,00:00:46.570
"created by President
Eisenhower.",00:00:46.570,00:00:48.350
Guess why?,00:00:48.350,00:00:49.600
"Let's see, maybe the
ROTC people know.",00:00:52.560,00:00:55.860
"You know why Eisenhower
created the",00:00:55.860,00:00:58.840
interstate highway system?,00:00:58.840,00:01:01.800
"Well, in public affairs, of
course, there's always a",00:01:01.800,00:01:06.670
"distinction to be
made between the",00:01:06.670,00:01:08.420
explanation and the reason.,00:01:08.420,00:01:10.990
The explanation was--,00:01:10.990,00:01:13.276
"AUDIENCE: To move weapons
across the country?",00:01:13.276,00:01:16.463
"PROFESSOR: Well,
to move nuclear",00:01:16.463,00:01:17.560
weapons across the country.,00:01:17.560,00:01:18.700
"Let's put it in, sightly,
more benign terms.",00:01:18.700,00:01:20.700
"Eisenhower had observed that
the German army was able to",00:01:20.700,00:01:24.240
"move its troops rapidly, even
though we bombed their",00:01:24.240,00:01:28.950
"railroads into oblivion because
of their auto bond.",00:01:28.950,00:01:32.910
"So Eisenhower conceived that if
there were ever an invasion",00:01:32.910,00:01:36.473
"in the United States, we too
would want to be able to move",00:01:36.473,00:01:39.600
"our forces around on
a highway system.",00:01:39.600,00:01:42.300
"And consequence of that, we
have a pretty good highway",00:01:42.300,00:01:46.340
"system and pretty awful
railroad system.",00:01:46.340,00:01:48.010
It's interesting.,00:01:48.010,00:01:50.060
"I'm a beneficiary of that, in a
funny way, because I'm from",00:01:50.060,00:01:53.410
"East Peoria, Illinois.",00:01:53.410,00:01:55.050
"And I was surrounded by the
factors of Caterpillar Tractor",00:01:55.050,00:01:57.600
"Company, which made all of the
tractors that built all of",00:01:57.600,00:02:00.725
those roads.,00:02:00.725,00:02:01.990
"So my high school spent money
like water from that huge tax",00:02:01.990,00:02:06.180
base of all those factors.,00:02:06.180,00:02:09.270
"Anyway, today we want to find
the very best path, instead of",00:02:09.270,00:02:14.990
just a good path.,00:02:14.990,00:02:16.550
"And like the last time, we'll
deal with, both, an example",00:02:16.550,00:02:26.050
"that we can set our program
to work on.",00:02:26.050,00:02:29.640
"By the way, can you find the
shortest path between S and G?",00:02:29.640,00:02:34.180
"Would you like to bet your
life on the shortest path",00:02:34.180,00:02:36.885
between S and G?,00:02:36.885,00:02:39.000
"Probably, not.",00:02:39.000,00:02:39.920
"With your eye, you can
find a good path.",00:02:39.920,00:02:42.600
"But you can't find the
best possible path.",00:02:42.600,00:02:46.020
"Today, what we're doing is
probably not modeling any",00:02:46.020,00:02:48.500
"obvious property of what we
have inside our heads.",00:02:48.500,00:02:51.550
"But being able to find the best
path is part of the skill",00:02:51.550,00:02:55.610
"set that anybody who's had a
course artificial intelligence",00:02:55.610,00:02:58.260
would be expected to have.,00:02:58.260,00:03:00.270
"So we're going to look at it,
even though it's not like many",00:03:00.270,00:03:02.010
of the things we do.,00:03:02.010,00:03:03.170
"A model of something
that's, probably,",00:03:03.170,00:03:04.660
going on in your head.,00:03:04.660,00:03:07.520
"So we're going to use, both,
this example from Cambridge",00:03:07.520,00:03:10.710
and our Blackboard example.,00:03:10.710,00:03:14.450
"Let's see, we have to
caution ourselves.",00:03:14.450,00:03:16.800
"Tanya, is search about maps?",00:03:16.800,00:03:20.320
"No, it's about what?",00:03:20.320,00:03:22.690
"Starts with a C. And the next
letter is H. And it ends up",00:03:22.690,00:03:27.830
being choice.,00:03:27.830,00:03:28.750
So we're talking about choice.,00:03:28.750,00:03:30.460
Not about maps.,00:03:30.460,00:03:31.240
"Even though our examples are
drawn from maps because",00:03:31.240,00:03:35.150
"they're convenient, they're
visual, and helps understand",00:03:35.150,00:03:37.410
"the concepts behind the
algorithms I'm talking about.",00:03:37.410,00:03:42.190
"So let's start off by looking
at our classroom example.",00:03:42.190,00:03:46.390
"And I did something today that
I neglected to do last time.",00:03:46.390,00:03:50.570
"And that's talk to you
about what I meant",00:03:50.570,00:03:52.030
by heuristic distance.,00:03:52.030,00:03:53.810
"It's those pink lines that
I just drew on the map.",00:03:53.810,00:03:57.350
"We're talking about the distance
as the crow would fly",00:03:57.350,00:04:00.130
"between two places, even though
there's no road that",00:04:00.130,00:04:03.520
goes between those two places.,00:04:03.520,00:04:06.200
"So in general, and we discussed
last time, it's best",00:04:06.200,00:04:11.100
"to get yourself into a place
that's close, as the crow",00:04:11.100,00:04:14.950
"flies, to your goal.",00:04:14.950,00:04:17.170
"And of course, that's a
heuristic and it can get you",00:04:17.170,00:04:19.740
"in trouble because it's
not always true.",00:04:19.740,00:04:23.020
"It would appear that being at
node E is a good place to be",00:04:23.020,00:04:26.630
"because it's not very far from
G. But in that particular case",00:04:26.630,00:04:31.040
"designed to illustrate the
point, being close is,",00:04:31.040,00:04:34.030
"actually, not a good thing
because it's a dead end.",00:04:34.030,00:04:37.770
"But in general, it's a good
thing to be close.",00:04:37.770,00:04:40.110
"And we talked last time about
hill climbing and beam search,",00:04:40.110,00:04:46.150
"being close was the objective
of those kinds of searches.",00:04:46.150,00:04:48.580
"And at one point, in a beam
search illustration, we had C,",00:04:48.580,00:04:52.060
"B, A, and D. We had paths
terminating at all four of",00:04:52.060,00:04:56.980
"those nodes as candidates for
the next round of search.",00:04:56.980,00:05:00.980
"And we decided on the basis of
these airline distances to",00:05:00.980,00:05:04.660
"keep D and B, and reject A and C
because they're further away",00:05:04.660,00:05:09.720
as the crow flies.,00:05:09.720,00:05:12.060
"Now, I repeat this even though
many of you have had this",00:05:12.060,00:05:14.340
"fixed already in your tutorials
because we're going",00:05:14.340,00:05:16.790
"to need this concept of
heuristic distance today.",00:05:16.790,00:05:22.450
"And I wanted to be sure that
that point has been clarified.",00:05:22.450,00:05:28.250
"So now, with this smaller map I
imagine you can do, by eye,",00:05:28.250,00:05:33.030
"a determination of what
the shortest path is.",00:05:33.030,00:05:37.580
"What is it, Juana?",00:05:37.580,00:05:38.230
Can you help me out with that?,00:05:38.230,00:05:41.584
"AUDIENCE: S, A, D, G.",00:05:41.584,00:05:43.800
"PROFESSOR: S, A, D, G. And if
you add up those distances,",00:05:43.800,00:05:47.820
"the distance is 11 along that
path that goes from S, first",00:05:47.820,00:05:54.430
"to A, and then to D, and then
from D to G. So Juana asserts",00:05:54.430,00:05:59.640
that that is the best path.,00:05:59.640,00:06:00.860
"And we're going to treat Juana
as an Oracle because we're",00:06:00.860,00:06:04.540
"going to follow, in our initial
attempt to understand",00:06:04.540,00:06:07.830
"these algorithms,
a very important",00:06:07.830,00:06:10.590
principle of problem solving.,00:06:10.590,00:06:12.020
"And that is that, if you want
to solve a problem, the",00:06:12.020,00:06:14.770
"easiest way is, usually, ask
somebody who knows the answer.",00:06:14.770,00:06:17.810
"Or Google, which also, probably,
knows the answer.",00:06:17.810,00:06:22.290
"So in this particular case,
we believe that",00:06:22.290,00:06:25.290
Juana knows the answer.,00:06:25.290,00:06:26.270
"And she said that the shortest
path is S,A, D, G, and its",00:06:26.270,00:06:30.170
path length is 11.,00:06:30.170,00:06:32.310
"But we don't trust her because
we're applying to the same",00:06:32.310,00:06:36.680
"medical school and she may
be trying to screw us.",00:06:36.680,00:06:39.673
[LAUGHTER],00:06:39.673,00:06:42.140
"PROFESSOR: So we're going to
be very cautious about",00:06:42.140,00:06:44.380
"accepting her answer until we've
checked it to make sure",00:06:44.380,00:06:48.320
"that she hasn't attempted
to delude us.",00:06:48.320,00:06:53.750
"So how do we go about
doing that?",00:06:53.750,00:06:55.970
"Well, one way to do that is to
check to be sure that all",00:06:55.970,00:06:59.490
"other possible paths that we
could develop end up being,",00:06:59.490,00:07:03.380
"for sure, longer than the one
that Juana has told us about.",00:07:03.380,00:07:07.700
"So she's told us about S, A, D,
G. And it has a total path",00:07:07.700,00:07:16.910
length of 11.,00:07:16.910,00:07:18.610
"And now what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to develop",00:07:18.610,00:07:20.500
"the rest of this tree-like
diagram.",00:07:20.500,00:07:25.995
"But what I'm going to do is,
I'm not going to do it in a",00:07:25.995,00:07:28.380
British Museum or random way.,00:07:28.380,00:07:30.270
"What I'm going to do is, I'm
going to look at the choice",00:07:30.270,00:07:34.830
"that corresponds the shortest
path that can be extended.",00:07:34.830,00:07:38.960
"So the shortest path that
can be extended is",00:07:38.960,00:07:42.160
this one right here.,00:07:42.160,00:07:44.620
"The one that just has the
starting node in it.",00:07:44.620,00:07:47.480
"And I could have gone this other
way to B. And if I go",00:07:47.480,00:07:50.880
"that other way to B, then
the path length along",00:07:50.880,00:07:53.870
that side is 5.,00:07:53.870,00:07:57.240
"And likewise, if I look at the
path that terminates in A,",00:07:57.240,00:08:02.760
that has a path length of 3.,00:08:02.760,00:08:06.950
So now I've got two choices.,00:08:06.950,00:08:08.300
"A and B. I've got choices
that extend",00:08:08.300,00:08:11.710
beyond those two places.,00:08:11.710,00:08:14.170
"So I'm always going to
extend the one that",00:08:14.170,00:08:15.640
has the shorter length.,00:08:15.640,00:08:18.250
"So in this case, that would be
the path that goes from S to",00:08:18.250,00:08:20.450
A.,00:08:20.450,00:08:22.380
"So if I from S to A, I don't
have to go to D. I can also go",00:08:22.380,00:08:25.480
"to B. And if I go to B, then the
accumulated path length is",00:08:25.480,00:08:33.429
"S, A, B. That's 7.",00:08:33.429,00:08:35.120
"And know that we're talking now
about the path, like the",00:08:37.760,00:08:43.120
"accumulated path length, that
we've traveled so far.",00:08:43.120,00:08:46.430
"Last time we were talking
a lot about",00:08:46.430,00:08:48.120
distances to the goal.,00:08:48.120,00:08:50.220
"Heuristic estimates of how
far we are from the goal.",00:08:50.220,00:08:53.340
"Now we're doing exactly
the opposite.",00:08:53.340,00:08:55.500
"We're not considering how
far we've got to go.",00:08:55.500,00:08:58.570
"We're only thinking about how
far we've gone so far.",00:08:58.570,00:09:02.450
"So now, repeating these
steps again.",00:09:02.450,00:09:05.830
I've got 7 and 5.,00:09:05.830,00:09:07.660
"So I'll go over and consider
the choices that go through",00:09:07.660,00:09:10.790
"the B node on the path S, B. And
that gives me S, B, A and",00:09:10.790,00:09:16.360
"S, B, C. And what are
those path lengths?",00:09:16.360,00:09:21.440
"Well, let's see.",00:09:21.440,00:09:22.480
"S, B, A would be 9.",00:09:22.480,00:09:27.200
"And S, B,C would be 9.",00:09:27.200,00:09:29.620
"And now the shortest path
is this one over here.",00:09:29.620,00:09:32.740
So I extend that.,00:09:32.740,00:09:34.430
"I go S, A, B. S, A, B. The only
place I can go is C. That",00:09:34.430,00:09:40.280
adds another 4.,00:09:40.280,00:09:42.150
So that's 11.,00:09:42.150,00:09:43.280
"And what do I know
about that path?",00:09:43.280,00:09:46.690
"I don't have to take that
any further, right?",00:09:46.690,00:09:49.770
"Because the path length, since
I've gone on that path",00:09:49.770,00:09:53.350
"already, is equal to the path
length that Juana has told me",00:09:53.350,00:09:56.690
gets me to the goal.,00:09:56.690,00:09:59.240
"So it'll be foolhardy to carry
on because, presuming that",00:09:59.240,00:10:02.110
"these lengths are all
non-negative, I",00:10:02.110,00:10:04.810
can't do any better.,00:10:04.810,00:10:07.270
"And I can't even do as well,
unless I've got a length that",00:10:07.270,00:10:10.270
has 0 length.,00:10:10.270,00:10:13.440
"So now that I have that idea,
I can quickly finish up by",00:10:13.440,00:10:15.820
"saying, well, let me consider
these two paths.",00:10:15.820,00:10:17.570
"S, B, A can only go to D. And
if I go to D, that adds 3.",00:10:17.570,00:10:23.982
9 plus 3 is 12.,00:10:23.982,00:10:27.550
"Nothing else can happen there
because that's 12 and I've got",00:10:27.550,00:10:30.750
a path of a goal that's 11.,00:10:30.750,00:10:33.470
"C, I can only go to E. It's a
dead-end but I don't have to",00:10:33.470,00:10:37.500
"think about that because I
know that the accumulated",00:10:37.500,00:10:39.640
"distance along this
path is 6 plus 9.",00:10:39.640,00:10:43.730
That's 15.,00:10:43.730,00:10:45.640
"So all of these need not be
extended any further because",00:10:45.640,00:10:50.740
"their length, accumulated so
far, is equal to or less than",00:10:50.740,00:10:54.090
a length of a goal.,00:10:54.090,00:10:55.500
So I've checked the Oracle.,00:10:55.500,00:10:57.380
"And although we're applying to
the same medical school, Juana",00:10:57.380,00:11:01.120
has told me the truth.,00:11:01.120,00:11:04.400
"So now, unfortunately, Juana's
not always around.",00:11:04.400,00:11:07.835
"And I don't always
have an Oracle.",00:11:07.835,00:11:10.690
"So I'm going to have to have
some way of finding the",00:11:10.690,00:11:15.030
"shortest path without
that Oracle",00:11:15.030,00:11:17.440
that I can check against.,00:11:17.440,00:11:19.210
Let's see.,00:11:22.740,00:11:23.190
What can I do?,00:11:23.190,00:11:24.440
"Maybe I can do the same
thing I just did.",00:11:26.450,00:11:29.430
"Always extend the shortest path
so far and hope that I",00:11:29.430,00:11:32.150
"run into the goal
at some point.",00:11:32.150,00:11:34.630
"And then I have to ask myself
the question how much extra",00:11:34.630,00:11:36.800
"work did I need to do when
I don't have the Oracle?",00:11:36.800,00:11:40.210
"Let's just try it and
see what happens.",00:11:40.210,00:11:43.760
"You don't have that
path to start.",00:11:43.760,00:11:45.400
"So I just have S. This
distance is 0.",00:11:45.400,00:11:49.400
"I can go either to A or B.
If I go to A, I've got",00:11:49.400,00:11:54.590
a distance of 3.,00:11:54.590,00:11:56.080
"Here, I've got a
distance of 5.",00:11:56.080,00:11:59.410
"I'll extend the path that goes
S, A. That can either got to B",00:11:59.410,00:12:04.550
"or D. Going to B or D
gives me 7 that way.",00:12:04.550,00:12:10.360
"S, A, D gives me 6.",00:12:10.360,00:12:13.200
"So looking across all of these
and extending the shortest",00:12:13.200,00:12:15.690
"path so far takes me back over
to S, B. So I extend those.",00:12:15.690,00:12:24.980
"S, B takes me to A or C.",00:12:24.980,00:12:30.510
"And those, in turn, have
total accumulated path",00:12:30.510,00:12:33.550
lengths of 9 and 9.,00:12:33.550,00:12:35.880
"Now the shortest one is S, A,
D. You see the pattern.",00:12:35.880,00:12:39.390
Now let's see.,00:12:39.390,00:12:40.890
I haven't found the goal yet.,00:12:40.890,00:12:45.930
"So I can ask myself the question
is any of the work",00:12:45.930,00:12:48.720
that I've done so far wasted?,00:12:48.720,00:12:52.190
"No because all of the paths
that I've got so far are",00:12:52.190,00:12:54.710
"shorter than the path of the
goal because the goal",00:12:54.710,00:12:57.750
hasn't shown up.,00:12:57.750,00:12:59.700
"So when I do my oracle checking
after I found the",00:12:59.700,00:13:02.230
"goal, none of that work's
going to be wasted.",00:13:02.230,00:13:06.220
"So in the end, I don't,
actually, need the Oracle.",00:13:06.220,00:13:09.120
"I could just develop this
graph by extending the",00:13:09.120,00:13:12.760
"shortest path, so far,
until I hit the goal.",00:13:12.760,00:13:16.390
"And then, perhaps, do a little
remaining checking to make",00:13:16.390,00:13:19.030
"sure that all the other paths
extend with a length that's",00:13:19.030,00:13:22.610
"greater than the path
of the goal.",00:13:22.610,00:13:24.970
"So if those words are confusing,
let's carry on with",00:13:24.970,00:13:26.855
"the algorithm, and I think
it'll be clearer.",00:13:26.855,00:13:30.000
So let's see.,00:13:30.000,00:13:30.390
"We've got the 7,
6, and two 9s.",00:13:30.390,00:13:33.490
"We're going to extend
the one that's 6.",00:13:33.490,00:13:35.530
That gets this to the goal.,00:13:35.530,00:13:36.900
"Boom, we've got it.",00:13:36.900,00:13:38.690
"And we've got a path
length of 11.",00:13:38.690,00:13:41.230
"Note, though, we can't quit
because we have to be sure",00:13:41.230,00:13:46.040
"that all other paths
are longer than 11.",00:13:46.040,00:13:49.300
"So now we have to carry on with
the same algorithm that",00:13:49.300,00:13:51.530
we started with.,00:13:51.530,00:13:52.580
The Oracle checking algorithm.,00:13:52.580,00:13:55.630
"And when we do that, we look
for this shortest path, so",00:13:55.630,00:13:59.460
"far, that has not
been extended.",00:13:59.460,00:14:01.650
"That's B, S, A, B. That
goes to C. That's 11.",00:14:01.650,00:14:08.360
So we're done there.,00:14:08.360,00:14:10.010
A goes to D. That adds 3.,00:14:10.010,00:14:13.600
That's 12.,00:14:13.600,00:14:15.630
C goes to E. That adds 6.,00:14:15.630,00:14:18.390
That's 15.,00:14:18.390,00:14:20.050
"And sure enough, we're done.",00:14:20.050,00:14:22.020
OK?,00:14:22.020,00:14:23.270
Elliot?,00:14:26.296,00:14:27.742
"AUDIENCE: Does it know that
there's know that there isn't",00:14:27.742,00:14:29.810
"a chance that you could have a
zero distance extension from",00:14:29.810,00:14:33.110
the [INAUDIBLE]?,00:14:33.110,00:14:35.460
"PROFESSOR: The question is, does
it know that there's no",00:14:35.460,00:14:39.302
"zero distance length
that's coming up.",00:14:39.302,00:14:44.510
"That's an implementation
detail.",00:14:44.510,00:14:46.400
"This guarantees you'll find a
path that's as short as any",00:14:46.400,00:14:51.010
that you can possibly find.,00:14:51.010,00:14:52.320
"But there might be others if
they're zero-length lengths.",00:14:52.320,00:14:55.580
As long as they're non-negative,00:14:55.580,00:14:56.580
"lengths, we're safe.",00:14:56.580,00:14:58.020
We've got a shortest path.,00:14:58.020,00:15:00.740
So that was easy.,00:15:00.740,00:15:01.670
"And now we can repeat the
exercise with our more",00:15:01.670,00:15:04.560
complicated map of Cambridge.,00:15:04.560,00:15:06.490
"First of all, let's do depth
first just to recall what that",00:15:10.260,00:15:13.000
looks like.,00:15:13.000,00:15:14.610
"That is, certainly,
not a short path.",00:15:14.610,00:15:18.210
"So let's try this idea, which,
by the way, bares the label",00:15:18.210,00:15:22.270
branch inbound.,00:15:22.270,00:15:24.110
"Let's try branch inbound
on the same map.",00:15:24.110,00:15:26.740
And there it goes.,00:15:30.226,00:15:32.040
"Each of those little flickers
is trying another path.",00:15:32.040,00:15:35.720
"So you can see it's working
it's guts out to find the",00:15:35.720,00:15:40.590
shortest path.,00:15:40.590,00:15:41.840
"It's almost there but it's
almost a pathological case.",00:15:52.250,00:15:57.870
"Or it's almost doing
British Museum.",00:15:57.870,00:16:01.410
"There it's finally found
the shortest path.",00:16:01.410,00:16:04.620
"Now there are some things
we can ask about that.",00:16:04.620,00:16:06.190
"But first of all, before I ask
anything about it, I'd like to",00:16:06.190,00:16:08.910
"get the flow chart up on the
board because we're going to",00:16:08.910,00:16:11.250
"decorate that flow chart,
a little bit, as we go.",00:16:11.250,00:16:15.100
"So the first thing we do
is initialize queue.",00:16:15.100,00:16:17.140
"Then we're going to test first
path on the queue.",00:16:24.100,00:16:31.310
"Then we might be happy because
we might be done.",00:16:34.380,00:16:38.650
"We might have a shortest
path to the goal.",00:16:38.650,00:16:41.030
"Actually, that's not
quite true, is it?",00:16:41.030,00:16:43.650
"We can't really quit until
every other path is it.",00:16:43.650,00:16:48.070
"Well, that's interesting.",00:16:48.070,00:16:49.320
"If the first element on the
queue gets us all the way to",00:16:55.760,00:16:58.370
"the goal, and we sorted our
queue by path length, are we",00:16:58.370,00:17:02.500
"through as soon as that first
element on the queue gets us",00:17:02.500,00:17:06.680
to the goal?,00:17:06.680,00:17:09.111
"Yeah because every other
path must have been",00:17:09.111,00:17:11.640
sorted beyond it.,00:17:11.640,00:17:14.230
"And therefore, it can't offer us
a shorter path to the goal.",00:17:14.230,00:17:18.839
"So if the first path is a path
to the goal we're done.",00:17:18.839,00:17:22.550
"Alas, it usually isn't.",00:17:22.550,00:17:24.190
So we'll extend first path.,00:17:24.190,00:17:26.490
"We're going to put all those
extensions back on the queue,",00:17:36.549,00:17:39.790
"and then we're going
to sort them.",00:17:39.790,00:17:41.290
"So that's, pretty much, the
same as we did last time.",00:17:46.030,00:17:50.340
"We're always going to put the
elements back on the queue.",00:17:50.340,00:17:55.610
"We're going to look at the first
element the queue and",00:17:55.610,00:17:57.150
see if it's a winner.,00:17:57.150,00:17:58.360
If it is we're done.,00:17:58.360,00:17:59.430
"If it's not, we're going
to extend it.",00:17:59.430,00:18:02.520
"And then go back in here
and try again.",00:18:02.520,00:18:06.787
"Well, sort of.",00:18:09.710,00:18:10.900
"But we noted that this did a
awful lot of work because if",00:18:10.900,00:18:15.600
"we look at those statistics
up there, it put 1,354",00:18:15.600,00:18:20.970
paths onto the queue.,00:18:20.970,00:18:22.210
That's the N queueing part.,00:18:22.210,00:18:24.210
"And then it extended 835,000
paths that had come to the",00:18:24.210,00:18:28.690
front of the queue.,00:18:28.690,00:18:29.940
"Now I'd like to give you an
aside because it's easy to get",00:18:32.496,00:18:37.590
"confused about N queueing
and extending.",00:18:37.590,00:18:41.890
"In all of the searches we did
last time, it would have been",00:18:41.890,00:18:45.110
"perfectly reasonable to keep a
list of all the paths that we",00:18:45.110,00:18:48.660
had put onto the queue.,00:18:48.660,00:18:51.444
An N queueing list.,00:18:51.444,00:18:53.850
"And never add a path to our
queue if it terminates in a",00:18:53.850,00:19:00.540
"node that some other path
terminate in that has already",00:19:00.540,00:19:05.820
gone to the queue.,00:19:05.820,00:19:07.110
"What I said last time was let
us keep track of the things",00:19:07.110,00:19:11.820
"that have been extended and
not extend them again.",00:19:11.820,00:19:15.900
"So you can either keep track
of the nodes that have been",00:19:15.900,00:19:19.830
"extended and not extend
them again.",00:19:19.830,00:19:21.980
"Or look at the paths with nodes
that terminate, and",00:19:21.980,00:19:26.290
"blah, blah, blah and been put on
the queue, the queued ones.",00:19:26.290,00:19:28.570
"And not put things back
on the queue again.",00:19:28.570,00:19:31.380
"And I think, last time, I may
have put a column in there",00:19:31.380,00:19:33.535
that said N queued.,00:19:33.535,00:19:34.190
It should have been extended.,00:19:34.190,00:19:39.090
"Even though N queued worked last
time, only extended works",00:19:39.090,00:19:42.840
"this time because we want to
be sure that anything we",00:19:42.840,00:19:46.690
extend is a short path.,00:19:46.690,00:19:49.070
"So the N queued idea doesn't
work, at all, for these",00:19:49.070,00:19:54.370
optimal paths.,00:19:54.370,00:19:55.910
"So now I want to come back over
here off the side bar and",00:19:55.910,00:19:58.840
"say that we're keeping track
of all of the nodes, all of",00:19:58.840,00:20:01.945
"the paths that end in nodes
unless they have already been",00:20:01.945,00:20:07.040
"extended beyond that
particular place.",00:20:07.040,00:20:10.640
"So we need to decorate our
algorithm here and say test",00:20:10.640,00:20:16.590
"first path and extend
the first path",00:20:16.590,00:20:24.470
if not already extended.,00:20:24.470,00:20:31.180
"Because you can see that in the
example I had, so far, we",00:20:36.160,00:20:38.740
"did that same silliness that
we talked about last time.",00:20:38.740,00:20:43.130
"We extended paths that
went through A more",00:20:43.130,00:20:49.030
"than once, like so.",00:20:49.030,00:20:52.310
"Would it ever make sense
to extend this path?",00:20:52.310,00:20:55.470
"No because we've already
extended a path that got there",00:20:55.470,00:20:58.860
with less distance.,00:20:58.860,00:21:00.780
"Will it ever make sense
to extend this path?",00:21:00.780,00:21:03.900
"No because we've already
extended another path that",00:21:03.900,00:21:07.460
"gets to be by a shorter
distance.",00:21:07.460,00:21:11.000
"So if we keep an extended
list, we can add that to",00:21:11.000,00:21:15.040
"branch inbound to
our advantage.",00:21:15.040,00:21:18.130
"So let's see how that would work
on the classroom example.",00:21:18.130,00:21:22.570
And then we'll do Cambridge.,00:21:22.570,00:21:23.920
"So this is bridge inbound,
plus an extended list.",00:21:23.920,00:21:27.200
And I do mean extended.,00:21:33.414,00:21:37.260
Not in the N queued list.,00:21:37.260,00:21:38.350
N queued list won't work here.,00:21:38.350,00:21:39.600
"So let's see, I start off the
same way as I did before.",00:21:42.050,00:21:45.910
"S goes to either A or B.
That's a length of 3.",00:21:45.910,00:21:52.200
That's a length of 5.,00:21:52.200,00:21:53.980
"So I extend A. That goes to
either B or D. But B is as if",00:21:53.980,00:22:05.100
it wasn't there at all.,00:22:05.100,00:22:07.690
"Oh, sorry.",00:22:07.690,00:22:08.235
Hang on.,00:22:08.235,00:22:09.485
B goes there.,00:22:13.180,00:22:13.990
"And those path lengths
are 7 and 6.",00:22:13.990,00:22:18.140
"And now I look around on the
board, and I say what is the",00:22:18.140,00:22:21.260
shortest path so far?,00:22:21.260,00:22:22.730
"And it's B. So I extend that
to get to A and C with path",00:22:22.730,00:22:28.610
lengths of 9 and 9.,00:22:28.610,00:22:32.020
"And what's the shortest
one next?",00:22:32.020,00:22:33.820
"It's D. And that goes to G.
And the path length is 11.",00:22:33.820,00:22:38.690
"And what's the shortest
one on the board?",00:22:38.690,00:22:42.640
"The one that has to
be extended next.",00:22:42.640,00:22:44.010
"That's this one that gets to B.
But I've already extended a",00:22:44.010,00:22:46.690
"path that get to B. So I don't,",00:22:46.690,00:22:49.230
"actually, do that extension.",00:22:49.230,00:22:51.570
So I've saved some work.,00:22:51.570,00:22:53.801
"But I've got to go over here
and do these two now.",00:22:53.801,00:22:56.260
But wait.,00:22:56.260,00:22:56.610
"I've already extended B. I've
already extended A, so I don't",00:22:56.610,00:22:59.770
have to do that one either.,00:22:59.770,00:23:01.930
"The only one I have to do is
the one that goes to C. And",00:23:01.930,00:23:04.340
"that those then to E with
a path length of 15.",00:23:04.340,00:23:07.950
And I'm done.,00:23:07.950,00:23:09.670
"So if you compare this one with
a previous one, you can",00:23:09.670,00:23:12.760
"see that there might be vast
areas of this tree that are",00:23:12.760,00:23:15.450
"pruned away and don't have
to be examined all.",00:23:15.450,00:23:19.250
"So now, just for the sake of
illustrating that, I would",00:23:19.250,00:23:21.860
"like to keep track of just
one of those statistics.",00:23:21.860,00:23:24.740
The number of extensions.,00:23:24.740,00:23:27.260
"So for this particular example,
case one, the number",00:23:27.260,00:23:30.420
of extensions was 835.,00:23:30.420,00:23:35.330
"Why don't you see if you can
guess to yourself what it",00:23:35.330,00:23:37.380
"would be if I use this concept
of an extended list.",00:23:37.380,00:23:42.360
"See, I'm not going to extend
anything I've already extended",00:23:42.360,00:23:44.670
"because it's guaranteed to have
a longer path length then",00:23:44.670,00:23:47.420
"something that already got
to that same place.",00:23:47.420,00:23:50.200
So it makes no sense to do it.,00:23:50.200,00:23:53.790
"So let me change the type to
branch-and-bound with an",00:23:53.790,00:23:58.520
extended list.,00:23:58.520,00:24:00.750
"I'm going to turn the speed
down a little bit so",00:24:00.750,00:24:02.420
we can watch it.,00:24:02.420,00:24:04.150
"It might take the rest
of the hour.",00:24:04.150,00:24:05.830
Who knows?,00:24:05.830,00:24:07.080
Still doing a lot of work.,00:24:13.160,00:24:14.000
"Still examining a
lot of paths.",00:24:14.000,00:24:15.445
"Well, look at that.",00:24:22.880,00:24:24.130
"Instead of 835 extensions
it only did 38.",00:24:26.450,00:24:33.200
"So that's a pretty substantial
savings.",00:24:33.200,00:24:35.800
"And you would never not
want to do that.",00:24:35.800,00:24:39.360
"So note that that's a layering
on top of branching out.",00:24:39.360,00:24:42.370
"That's not a different
algorithm.",00:24:42.370,00:24:44.300
"It's an adjustment improvement
to the algorithm, and it makes",00:24:44.300,00:24:47.250
it more efficient.,00:24:47.250,00:24:48.500
"So this whole thing is
based on what I call",00:24:50.830,00:24:55.490
the dead horse principle.,00:24:55.490,00:24:57.130
"As soon as we figure out that
a path that goes to a",00:24:57.130,00:25:00.980
"particular place can't possibly
be the winning path,",00:25:00.980,00:25:04.640
"we get rid of it, and don't
bother extending it.",00:25:04.640,00:25:08.830
It's a dead horse principle.,00:25:08.830,00:25:12.330
"But if we look at this example,
what's the shortest",00:25:12.330,00:25:18.830
"possible length of a
path that's already",00:25:18.830,00:25:21.350
gone from S to B?,00:25:21.350,00:25:22.600
"What do you think, Tanya?",00:25:27.776,00:25:29.204
"Well, first of all, it can't be
less than 5 because we've",00:25:32.070,00:25:34.110
already gone that distance.,00:25:34.110,00:25:37.390
"So when I say what's the
shortest length of any path",00:25:37.390,00:25:40.300
"that there could possibly be
that goes from S to D. We know",00:25:40.300,00:25:44.090
it's at least 5.,00:25:44.090,00:25:46.420
"But can we say something
more about it?",00:25:46.420,00:25:50.680
"Especially, when we look at
these airline distances, and",00:25:50.680,00:25:54.140
"note that this airline distance
is 6, and that's a",00:25:54.140,00:25:57.420
"little more than 7, and that's
a little more than 7.",00:25:57.420,00:26:01.150
So what do you think?,00:26:01.150,00:26:02.400
"So it's gone from S to B, and
the question is what's the",00:26:04.680,00:26:07.270
"shortest path that could
possibly be that had started",00:26:07.270,00:26:13.370
out going from S to B?,00:26:13.370,00:26:14.620
11 right?,00:26:17.860,00:26:19.780
"Because we can't have a path
that's shorter than the",00:26:19.780,00:26:23.690
airline distance.,00:26:23.690,00:26:25.630
"If there were a straight line
road from A to G, its length",00:26:25.630,00:26:29.450
would be 6.,00:26:29.450,00:26:30.320
But there isn't.,00:26:30.320,00:26:31.630
"So that gives us a lower bound
on the distance that we have",00:26:31.630,00:26:37.740
along that path.,00:26:37.740,00:26:39.840
"So we're using the accumulated
distance, plus the airline",00:26:39.840,00:26:45.520
"distance, to give us a lower
bound on the path that we've",00:26:45.520,00:26:49.980
"started off on that
goes from S to B.",00:26:49.980,00:26:53.750
"Once again, let's solidify a
little bit by simulating the",00:26:53.750,00:26:57.730
"search and seeing how
it turns out.",00:26:57.730,00:27:01.320
"Not just I did last time, I'm
going to forget that I've got",00:27:01.320,00:27:04.270
an extended list.,00:27:04.270,00:27:06.510
"I don't want to carry both of
those things around with me at",00:27:06.510,00:27:08.840
the same time.,00:27:08.840,00:27:10.270
"So forget that we've got
an extended list.",00:27:10.270,00:27:12.620
"We'll bring all those back
together a little later.",00:27:12.620,00:27:16.020
"So we're going to forget
what we just did there.",00:27:16.020,00:27:18.160
"And instead we're just going
to use this concept of an",00:27:18.160,00:27:20.340
"airline distance and
see what happens.",00:27:20.340,00:27:22.705
"As before we start with
a starting node.",00:27:44.890,00:27:46.910
We have two choices as always.,00:27:46.910,00:27:48.640
"We can go to A or B. And the
accumulated distance, if we go",00:27:48.640,00:27:52.160
"to A, is 3.",00:27:52.160,00:27:54.580
"And then accumulated distance
if we go to B is 5.",00:27:54.580,00:27:58.350
"But now we're going to add
in the airline distances.",00:27:58.350,00:28:01.280
"So the airline distance from A
to G is a little more than 7,",00:28:01.280,00:28:08.140
which is 10 plus.,00:28:08.140,00:28:12.060
"The airline distance from
B to G is exactly 6.",00:28:12.060,00:28:16.400
So that gives us 11.,00:28:16.400,00:28:19.010
"And following the procedure
we've all been using already",00:28:19.010,00:28:22.070
"so far, we're going to extend
the path that seems to have",00:28:22.070,00:28:25.120
the shortest potential.,00:28:25.120,00:28:26.560
"Now it's the shortest potential
distance S to G. So",00:28:26.560,00:28:30.390
that must be this one here.,00:28:30.390,00:28:32.970
"So from A we can go to B
or D. The accumulated",00:28:32.970,00:28:41.480
"distance S, A, B, is 7.",00:28:41.480,00:28:43.065
"The airline distance is 6,
so that's equal to 11.",00:28:45.840,00:28:48.550
Standard arithmetic 13.,00:28:53.700,00:28:57.890
"The distance S, A, D. That is
6 plus a little more than 7.",00:28:57.890,00:29:05.280
"So what's the accumulated
distance?",00:29:10.900,00:29:14.090
"S, A, D is 3 plus 3 is 6.",00:29:14.090,00:29:18.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].,00:29:18.810,00:29:22.177
PROFESSOR: What?,00:29:22.177,00:29:22.925
"AUDIENCE: The airline distance
from D would be 5.",00:29:22.925,00:29:25.565
"PROFESSOR: Would be 5, right.",00:29:25.565,00:29:28.220
"So airline distance, in this
case, is the same as the",00:29:28.220,00:29:30.230
actual distance.,00:29:30.230,00:29:31.310
"So the accumulated
distance is 6.",00:29:31.310,00:29:33.190
The actual distance is 5.,00:29:33.190,00:29:35.360
So that's equal to 11.,00:29:35.360,00:29:36.610
"So now I've got two
11's on the board.",00:29:39.720,00:29:42.420
"And simulating what we'd ask
you do on a quiz, we don't",00:29:42.420,00:29:45.740
"know which of those is
going to be better.",00:29:45.740,00:29:47.520
They've got a tie score.,00:29:47.520,00:29:49.300
"So what we're going to do is
we're going to choose the one",00:29:49.300,00:29:50.810
that's lexically least.,00:29:50.810,00:29:52.510
"So B comes before D. So we'll
expand B. And that can go to",00:29:52.510,00:29:58.260
"either A or C. And we have to
calculate the best possible",00:29:58.260,00:30:05.170
"distance that goes along
those paths.",00:30:05.170,00:30:07.485
"The accumulated distance
S, B, A. S, B, A is 9.",00:30:07.485,00:30:14.670
So that's 9 plus 7 plus.,00:30:14.670,00:30:18.140
That's 16 plus.,00:30:18.140,00:30:20.700
"This has an accumulated
lead of distance of 9.",00:30:20.700,00:30:23.170
Also plus 7 plus.,00:30:23.170,00:30:25.190
Also 16 plus.,00:30:25.190,00:30:29.060
"Well, now let's see.",00:30:29.060,00:30:30.000
"Things are shaping up pretty
well because this one has the",00:30:30.000,00:30:33.940
lowest score so far.,00:30:33.940,00:30:37.000
"We extend that to
G. And now the",00:30:37.000,00:30:39.760
accumulated distance is 11.,00:30:39.760,00:30:42.470
"The airline distance
is 0, so that's 11.",00:30:42.470,00:30:45.460
"And that's smaller than
everybody else.",00:30:45.460,00:30:48.840
So we've got.,00:30:48.840,00:30:51.040
"So now compare this one with
our branch inbound graph.",00:30:51.040,00:30:56.700
"And you see, once again, we've
done considerably less work.",00:30:56.700,00:31:01.370
"And that, in many practical
cases, means that instead of",00:31:01.370,00:31:04.850
"taking more than the remaining
lifetime of the universe to",00:31:04.850,00:31:08.300
"complete the calculation, it can
happen in a few seconds.",00:31:08.300,00:31:12.760
"But let's see how it works
on the example.",00:31:12.760,00:31:15.440
"So I'm not going to use
the extended list.",00:31:15.440,00:31:18.370
"I'm just going to use this idea
of using a lower bound on",00:31:18.370,00:31:23.810
"the distance remaining,
the airline distance,",00:31:23.810,00:31:26.710
and see what happens.,00:31:26.710,00:31:27.960
"So this time, the number
of extensions is 70.",00:32:00.168,00:32:02.980
"So it didn't do quite as well
as working alone as the",00:32:08.880,00:32:12.710
"extended list did
working alone.",00:32:12.710,00:32:14.680
"So we immediately conclude that
the extended list is more",00:32:14.680,00:32:20.160
"useful than using one of these
lower bound heuristics.",00:32:20.160,00:32:23.490
"By the way, this is called
an admissible heuristic.",00:32:23.490,00:32:25.570
"If the heuristic estimate is
guaranteed to be less than the",00:32:33.555,00:32:37.830
"actual distance, that's called
an admissible heuristic.",00:32:37.830,00:32:41.110
"Admissible because you can use
it for this kind of purpose.",00:32:41.110,00:32:45.230
"So it looks like the day
extended list is a more useful",00:32:45.230,00:32:51.940
idea than the admissible idea.,00:32:51.940,00:32:54.880
Right?,00:32:54.880,00:32:56.690
"What do you think about
that, Brett?",00:32:56.690,00:32:58.410
Am I hacking?,00:32:58.410,00:33:00.195
Am I joking?,00:33:00.195,00:33:00.945
"AUDIENCE: I think you're
judging prematurely.",00:33:00.945,00:33:02.580
"PROFESSOR: Why am I judging
prematurely?",00:33:02.580,00:33:04.180
"What do you think it
might depend on?",00:33:04.180,00:33:05.390
"AUDIENCE: The fact that we're
using extensions and the",00:33:05.390,00:33:08.055
"extended list pretty much
guarantees you can only extend",00:33:08.055,00:33:09.436
each node once.,00:33:09.436,00:33:12.054
"PROFESSOR: Well, Brett has sad
something unintelligible that",00:33:12.054,00:33:15.945
I can't think how to repeat.,00:33:15.945,00:33:17.600
"What he meant to say,
though, was that--",00:33:17.600,00:33:19.195
[LAUGHTER],00:33:19.195,00:33:22.360
"PROFESSOR: --in these cases,
it almost always depends on",00:33:22.360,00:33:24.770
the problem itself.,00:33:24.770,00:33:26.930
"If you change the problem, you
may get a different result.",00:33:26.930,00:33:29.670
"So why don't we change the
problem and see if we get a",00:33:29.670,00:33:31.370
different result?,00:33:31.370,00:33:32.480
"So instead of starting on the
extreme left, let's start in",00:33:32.480,00:33:36.040
"the middle and see
what happens.",00:33:36.040,00:33:37.380
"So I'll readjust my starting
position to be right there.",00:33:42.350,00:33:45.880
"Oops, that's the wrong
adjustment.",00:33:45.880,00:33:48.320
"And we might as well start
by getting our baseline",00:33:54.130,00:33:56.840
"branch-and-bound without
anything.",00:33:56.840,00:33:58.315
"And for that one, maybe, we'll
speed it up a little bit.",00:34:01.040,00:34:05.580
"So that gives us
57 extensions.",00:34:09.070,00:34:12.000
It's an easier problem.,00:34:12.000,00:34:13.250
"So let's try it with the
admissible heuristic.",00:34:18.880,00:34:22.080
That went too fast.,00:34:27.960,00:34:29.210
"Wow, still pretty fast.",00:34:33.920,00:34:35.610
Six extensions.,00:34:35.610,00:34:36.860
"What do you think this
number's going to be?",00:34:39.382,00:34:43.139
Closer to six or closer to 57?,00:34:43.139,00:34:45.989
Better than six?,00:34:45.989,00:34:46.630
Worse than six?,00:34:46.630,00:34:48.370
"Well, let's think.",00:34:48.370,00:34:50.889
"What we're going to do is we're
going to just not repeat",00:34:50.889,00:34:54.100
"any movements through
the same node again.",00:34:54.100,00:34:58.080
"But it's not going to
do something very",00:34:58.080,00:34:59.360
important for us.,00:34:59.360,00:35:00.085
"It's not going to keep us out
of the left side because it",00:35:00.085,00:35:04.350
"has no idea of the remaining
airline distance to the goal.",00:35:04.350,00:35:08.930
"So let's see if that's
true It sure is.",00:35:08.930,00:35:19.380
Look at that.,00:35:19.380,00:35:20.155
"It is, foolishly, spending
a lot of its' time doing",00:35:20.155,00:35:23.100
something we would never do.,00:35:23.100,00:35:24.090
"Namely, looking over there
on the left side.",00:35:24.090,00:35:25.740
"So this time, the number
of extensions is 35.",00:35:31.510,00:35:33.370
"So in case two, the admissible
heuristic",00:35:36.050,00:35:38.860
does very much better.,00:35:38.860,00:35:40.140
"In case one, the extension
thing does much better.",00:35:40.140,00:35:43.920
"But wait a minute, would we ever
not want to use both at",00:35:43.920,00:35:46.450
the same time?,00:35:46.450,00:35:47.700
"We wouldn't want to use just
one of these, right?",00:35:50.570,00:35:53.660
"They both have the possibility
of doing us a lot of good.",00:35:53.660,00:35:57.230
"So maybe if we put them in
harness together, we'll get",00:35:57.230,00:36:00.190
something that's even better.,00:36:00.190,00:36:02.170
And when we do that--,00:36:02.170,00:36:04.350
"see here, the extended list
is a layer on top",00:36:04.350,00:36:07.870
of branch and bound.,00:36:07.870,00:36:08.890
"The admissible heuristic
is another layer on top",00:36:08.890,00:36:11.200
of branch and bound.,00:36:11.200,00:36:12.250
"If we put those together, we get
something called A star.",00:36:12.250,00:36:17.490
"So A star is just branch and
bound, plus an extended list,",00:36:17.490,00:36:21.800
plus and admissible heuristic.,00:36:21.800,00:36:24.290
"So let's go back to our original
problem and try A",00:36:24.290,00:36:26.750
star on that.,00:36:26.750,00:36:28.000
"We're running this at a pretty
slow speed because we're",00:36:38.760,00:36:40.410
"expecting it to be a lot more
efficient than the original",00:36:40.410,00:36:43.190
branch and bound.,00:36:43.190,00:36:43.890
And sure enough it is.,00:36:43.890,00:36:44.560
"The number of extensions
is 27.",00:36:44.560,00:36:47.470
So look at that.,00:36:47.470,00:36:49.910
"A lot better than either of
those working independently.",00:36:49.910,00:36:52.950
"Now I can stick the thing in
the center and see what",00:36:52.950,00:36:54.750
happens then.,00:36:54.750,00:36:56.000
"So in this particular case,
the extended list didn't,",00:37:05.450,00:37:09.490
"actually, help us because our
admissible heuristic was",00:37:09.490,00:37:12.090
"channeling us so tightly
toward the",00:37:12.090,00:37:13.790
goal it didn't matter.,00:37:13.790,00:37:16.360
"So it all depends on the nature
of the space that",00:37:16.360,00:37:19.470
you're trying to explore.,00:37:19.470,00:37:22.160
"By the way, you know how
the whole works, right?",00:37:22.160,00:37:26.870
"So what you want to do is
you want to extend the",00:37:26.870,00:37:30.210
first path and sort.,00:37:30.210,00:37:32.120
"But not just by accumulated
distance.",00:37:32.120,00:37:35.120
"Sort by accumulated distance
plus admissible heuristic.",00:37:35.120,00:37:45.550
"But what are the
theoreticians?",00:37:53.010,00:37:54.090
You must be complaining.,00:37:54.090,00:37:56.550
Sort's expensive.,00:37:56.550,00:37:58.440
Do we actually need to sort?,00:37:58.440,00:38:00.740
"No, we don't actually
need to sort.",00:38:03.470,00:38:04.960
What do we to do?,00:38:04.960,00:38:05.900
"AUDIENCE: We just need to keep
track of what's the minimum.",00:38:05.900,00:38:09.141
"PROFESSOR: We just need
to keep track",00:38:09.141,00:38:09.946
of what's the minimum.,00:38:09.946,00:38:10.530
"So we don't need to, actually,
do that sort.",00:38:10.530,00:38:12.130
"That's an unnecessary
computation.",00:38:12.130,00:38:16.670
"So instead, we can test, not
the first path but the",00:38:16.670,00:38:20.770
shortest path.,00:38:20.770,00:38:22.020
And now you have it.,00:38:27.990,00:38:28.620
"Now you have the whole
of A star.",00:38:28.620,00:38:31.430
"And now you can go home, but I
don't think you should because",00:38:31.430,00:38:36.650
"I'm about to show you that this
idea of admissibility,",00:38:36.650,00:38:42.090
"actually, leads to certain screw
cases that we're very",00:38:42.090,00:38:44.410
fond of asking about on exams.,00:38:44.410,00:38:48.340
"So it turns out that the
admissible heuristic, in",00:38:48.340,00:38:51.280
"certain circumstances, could
get you into trouble.",00:38:51.280,00:38:53.400
"It doesn't look like it could
because, logically, nothing",00:38:53.400,00:38:56.940
"I've said seems strange
or questionable.",00:38:56.940,00:39:00.480
"But that's because I've been
working with a map.",00:39:00.480,00:39:04.150
"And it turns out that if you
work with a map then",00:39:04.150,00:39:06.100
"admissibility is a perfectly
sound way of",00:39:06.100,00:39:08.500
doing an optimal search.,00:39:08.500,00:39:11.710
"But, Travis, is search
just about maps?",00:39:11.710,00:39:15.650
"No, search is not
just about maps.",00:39:15.650,00:39:17.130
"So we may have non-Euclidean
arrangements that will cause",00:39:17.130,00:39:21.545
us trouble.,00:39:21.545,00:39:22.710
"So I'd like to illustrate that
with the following example.",00:39:22.710,00:39:24.815
"It's not going to be a large
map or a large graph.",00:39:32.710,00:39:36.100
"S, then go up here to A or
down here to B. Then they",00:39:36.100,00:39:43.866
"merge at C. And then they go
out here to the goal, G.",00:39:43.866,00:39:51.650
"And the actual distances
are 1, 1, 1, and 10.",00:39:51.650,00:39:58.810
"And over here, we'll
make that 100.",00:39:58.810,00:40:01.390
"So it's a kind of oddly
constructed map, but it's",00:40:01.390,00:40:05.340
"there because we need a
pathological case to",00:40:05.340,00:40:07.240
illustrate the idea.,00:40:07.240,00:40:09.510
"Now that's the actual
distances.",00:40:09.510,00:40:11.590
"And if we did branch and down
with an extended list,",00:40:11.590,00:40:15.090
"everything would
work just fine.",00:40:15.090,00:40:17.250
But we're not.,00:40:17.250,00:40:17.715
"We're going to use an admissible
heuristic.",00:40:17.715,00:40:20.530
"And we're going to say that
this guy has an estimated",00:40:20.530,00:40:22.760
distance to the goal of 100.,00:40:22.760,00:40:25.480
This guy is 0.,00:40:25.480,00:40:27.830
And this guy is 0.,00:40:27.830,00:40:30.240
"Now, 0 is always an
underestimate of the actual",00:40:30.240,00:40:33.500
"distance to the goal, right?",00:40:33.500,00:40:34.600
So I'm always free to use 0.,00:40:34.600,00:40:36.970
Is that 100 OK?,00:40:36.970,00:40:39.350
"Yeah because the actual
distances is 101, so it's less",00:40:39.350,00:40:43.400
than that the actual distance.,00:40:43.400,00:40:44.650
"So it's OK as an admissible
heuristic.",00:40:44.650,00:40:48.950
"So these numbers that I put up
here, together, constitute an",00:40:48.950,00:40:53.570
"admissible heuristic set of
estimates to the goal.",00:40:53.570,00:40:57.300
"So now, let's just simulate A
star and see what happens.",00:40:57.300,00:41:06.370
"So first of all, you start with
S, and that can either go",00:41:06.370,00:41:10.170
"to A or B. The actual distance
is 1 plus an estimate on the",00:41:10.170,00:41:20.130
remaining distance.,00:41:20.130,00:41:21.570
That gives us 100 plus 100.,00:41:21.570,00:41:25.410
That's equal to 101.,00:41:25.410,00:41:28.860
"If we go to B instead, the
actual distance is 1 plus the",00:41:28.860,00:41:32.160
"heuristic's distance is 0,
so that's equal to 1.",00:41:32.160,00:41:36.190
"OK, good.",00:41:36.190,00:41:36.870
"So now we know that we
always extend the",00:41:36.870,00:41:39.140
shortest path so far.,00:41:39.140,00:41:42.020
"Did I goof this, or are
you asking a question?",00:41:42.020,00:41:44.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?,00:41:44.020,00:41:45.270
"PROFESSOR: Yeah, when I say
actual, it's the actual",00:41:49.145,00:41:51.730
distance that you've traveled.,00:41:51.730,00:41:52.895
"AUDIENCE: But that's
[INAUDIBLE].",00:41:52.895,00:41:55.650
PROFESSOR: So wait a second.,00:41:55.650,00:41:57.250
"If I go from S to A,
the actual distance",00:41:57.250,00:42:00.123
I've traveled is 1.,00:42:00.123,00:42:01.338
"AUDIENCE: I meant like,
does the map--",00:42:01.338,00:42:03.282
"PROFESSOR: So now I'm taking
the sum of the actual",00:42:03.282,00:42:06.780
"distance, plus the estimated
distance to go.",00:42:06.780,00:42:08.735
AUDIENCE: All right.,00:42:08.735,00:42:09.474
"I'm just wondering if the
original map has to be",00:42:09.474,00:42:10.896
[INAUDIBLE].,00:42:10.896,00:42:12.792
"PROFESSOR: See this
is not a map.",00:42:12.792,00:42:17.270
"She was asking if the map has to
be geometrically accurate.",00:42:17.270,00:42:21.630
"See, this could be a model of
something that's not a map.",00:42:21.630,00:42:25.480
"And so, I'm free to put any
numbers on those links that I",00:42:25.480,00:42:28.230
"want, including estimates, as
long as they're underestimates",00:42:28.230,00:42:31.520
"of the distance along
the lengths.",00:42:31.520,00:42:35.250
"So this tells me that my
estimated distance",00:42:35.250,00:42:38.150
"here, so far, is 1.",00:42:38.150,00:42:40.810
"So I'll, surely, go down here
to C. And if I go to C, then",00:42:40.810,00:42:45.530
my accumulated distance is 11.,00:42:45.530,00:42:50.890
"And my estimate of the remaining
distance is 0.",00:42:50.890,00:42:53.190
So that's a total of 11.,00:42:56.140,00:42:57.505
"So now I'm following my
heuristic again and saying",00:43:00.400,00:43:02.270
"what's the shortest path on
a base of the accumulated",00:43:02.270,00:43:07.130
"distance plus the estimated
distance?",00:43:07.130,00:43:10.180
"Here, the accumulated
distance plus the",00:43:10.180,00:43:12.080
estimated distance is 101.,00:43:12.080,00:43:14.490
"Here, it's only 11.",00:43:14.490,00:43:15.600
"So plainly, I extend this guy.",00:43:15.600,00:43:18.420
And that gets me to the goal.,00:43:18.420,00:43:21.300
"And the total accumulated
distance is now 111 plus 0",00:43:21.300,00:43:27.980
equals 111.,00:43:27.980,00:43:29.230
"And that's not the shortest
path, but wait.",00:43:35.130,00:43:37.750
"I still have to do my
checking, right?",00:43:37.750,00:43:39.780
"I have to extend A. I when I
extend A, I get to B. And now,",00:43:39.780,00:43:45.900
"when I get to B that
way, my accumulated",00:43:45.900,00:43:48.710
distance is 2 plus my--,00:43:48.710,00:43:53.230
"oh, sorry.",00:43:53.230,00:43:53.920
"S, A, C.",00:43:53.920,00:43:57.640
My accumulate distance it 2.,00:43:57.640,00:43:59.170
"My estimated distance is 0,
so that's equal to 2.",00:43:59.170,00:44:02.910
"So I'm OK because I'm still
going to extend",00:44:02.910,00:44:05.150
"to this guy, right?",00:44:05.150,00:44:06.810
Wrong.,00:44:06.810,00:44:07.950
"I've already extended
that guy.",00:44:07.950,00:44:09.210
So I'm hosed.,00:44:12.220,00:44:13.530
"I won't find the shortest
path because I'm",00:44:13.530,00:44:15.640
going to stop there.,00:44:15.640,00:44:17.740
"And I'm going to stop there
because this is an admissible",00:44:17.740,00:44:20.085
"heuristic and that's not good
enough unless it's a map.",00:44:20.085,00:44:24.450
"It's not good enough for this
particular case because this",00:44:24.450,00:44:26.620
is not geometric.,00:44:26.620,00:44:27.210
"This cannot be done as
a map on a plane.",00:44:27.210,00:44:32.900
"So that's a situation where what
I've talked to you about,",00:44:32.900,00:44:36.850
"so far, works with
branch-and-bound.",00:44:36.850,00:44:39.730
"Works with branch-and -bound
plus an extended list.",00:44:39.730,00:44:42.070
"But doesn't work when we added
an admissible heuristic.",00:44:42.070,00:44:45.210
"So if we're going to do this in
general, we need something",00:44:45.210,00:44:48.020
"stronger than admissibility,
which works only on maps.",00:44:48.020,00:44:51.480
"And so the flourish that I'll
tell you about here in the",00:44:51.480,00:44:54.590
"last few seconds of today's
lecture is to add a refinement",00:44:54.590,00:45:10.780
as follows.,00:45:10.780,00:45:11.960
"So far, we've got
admissibility.",00:45:11.960,00:45:13.590
"And if we want to write this
down in a kind of mathematical",00:45:20.020,00:45:22.410
"notation, we could say that
it's admissible if the",00:45:22.410,00:45:25.680
"estimated distance between any
node X and the goal is less",00:45:25.680,00:45:31.500
"than or equal to the
actual distance",00:45:31.500,00:45:34.440
between X and the goal.,00:45:34.440,00:45:38.490
"That's the definition
of admissible.",00:45:38.490,00:45:40.230
"As long as heuristic does
that it's admissible.",00:45:40.230,00:45:43.350
"And A star works
if it's a map.",00:45:43.350,00:45:46.250
"But for that kind of situation
where it's not a map we need a",00:45:46.250,00:45:48.860
"stronger condition, which
is called consistency.",00:45:48.860,00:45:51.445
"And what that says is that the
distance between X and the",00:45:54.830,00:45:59.100
"goal minus the distance between
some other node in the",00:45:59.100,00:46:04.940
"goal, Y. Take the absolute
value of that.",00:46:04.940,00:46:11.010
"That has to be less than or
equal to the actual distance",00:46:11.010,00:46:13.950
between X and Y.,00:46:13.950,00:46:18.700
"So this heuristic satisfy the
consistency condition?",00:46:18.700,00:46:24.280
"Well, let's see.",00:46:24.280,00:46:25.600
Here the guess is 100.,00:46:25.600,00:46:27.980
Here it's 0.,00:46:27.980,00:46:28.660
"So the absolute difference
is 100.",00:46:28.660,00:46:31.590
"But the actual distance
is only 2.",00:46:31.590,00:46:34.440
"So it satisfies admissibility,
but it doesn't satisfy",00:46:34.440,00:46:38.170
consistency.,00:46:38.170,00:46:38.495
And it doesn't work.,00:46:38.495,00:46:40.320
"So you can almost be guaranteed
we'll give you a",00:46:40.320,00:46:41.880
"situation where if you
use an admissible",00:46:41.880,00:46:47.830
heuristic you'll lose.,00:46:47.830,00:46:50.490
"And if you use a consistent
heuristic, you'll still win.",00:46:50.490,00:46:54.290
"So how can we bring this
back into the fold?",00:46:57.220,00:47:00.570
"Well, we can't use
that heuristic.",00:47:00.570,00:47:01.950
It's no good.,00:47:01.950,00:47:03.480
"But if this heuristic estimate
of the goal were 2, then we'd",00:47:03.480,00:47:09.690
"be OK because then it would
